1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,913
Just pick something
and close the door.

2
00:00:02,075 --> 00:00:04,551
Guys, guys!
Look what happened.

3
00:00:04,619 --> 00:00:09,401
I have peach fuzz on my face.
Peach fuzz! See?

4
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:11,455
Congratulations, Ubuntu.

5
00:00:11,523 --> 00:00:13,474
This is your first step
into manhood.

6
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:14,757
The other steps
are a lot more fun

7
00:00:14,831 --> 00:00:16,672
and usually
involve strippers.

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,897
You are becoming a man.
In your native Africa,

9
00:00:18,965 --> 00:00:21,315
there would be a wonderful
culturally relative

10
00:00:21,383 --> 00:00:24,539
scarification
or body mutilation ritual.

11
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:26,487
But we're stuck
here in America,

12
00:00:26,554 --> 00:00:28,565
so a first shave
is a perfect way

13
00:00:28,633 --> 00:00:30,844
to commemorate
your transition.

14
00:00:30,918 --> 00:00:32,421
Shave me, daddy!

15
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:34,464
I'd better handle
this one.

16
00:00:34,532 --> 00:00:36,910
If he needs help shaving
his legs, he'll come to you.

17
00:00:37,483 --> 00:00:40,429
<i>We've got
a problem out here.</i>

18
00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:42,148
People were honking at me,

19
00:00:42,216 --> 00:00:44,592
but I figured they just agreed
with our bumper stickers.

20
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,970
I'll call
the tow company.

21
00:00:47,038 --> 00:00:49,481
What kind of man doesn't know
how to change a tire?

22
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,896
Dad, changing a tire
doesn't make you a man.

23
00:00:52,464 --> 00:00:53,840
Now, changing the world...

24
00:00:53,907 --> 00:00:56,886
Yeah, yeah. Bottom line is,
your boy is becoming a man,

25
00:00:56,954 --> 00:01:00,533
- and I'm the one who needs to show him
the way. - Ubuntu's becoming a man?

26
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:02,142
What exactly did you see?

27
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,688
Peach fuzz. Feel it!

28
00:01:03,756 --> 00:01:07,099
- You sure you weren't kissing bunnies
at the pet store again? - It's for real.

29
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:10,843
Good thing grandpa Charlie's
here to teach him the ropes.

30
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,655
I don't want my dad teaching
our son about manhood.

31
00:01:13,723 --> 00:01:15,998
Shaving is the trojan horse
he's going to use

32
00:01:16,065 --> 00:01:18,004
to sneak in
and corrupt Ubuntu.

33
00:01:18,072 --> 00:01:20,478
Remember when dad
took care of Che?

34
00:01:20,546 --> 00:01:23,289
Get it while it's bloody!

35
00:01:31,016 --> 00:01:32,419
What?

36
00:01:32,487 --> 00:01:34,493
It took nearly
a week of soy enemas

37
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,136
for Che to come
back to his senses.

38
00:01:37,203 --> 00:01:41,417
And now he's more committed
to a vegan lifestyle than ever.

39
00:01:41,485 --> 00:01:42,788
Done.

40
00:01:45,698 --> 00:01:47,270
Thanks for fixing
the tire, Trish.

41
00:01:47,338 --> 00:01:49,645
It's so good to have
a friend in the biz.

42
00:01:49,713 --> 00:01:52,485
Oh, hi, mo!
Are you working here now, too?

43
00:01:52,553 --> 00:01:55,494
No, I'm more of a fan.
I just love the smell.

44
00:01:57,467 --> 00:01:58,336
Hey, Ma!

45
00:01:58,406 --> 00:02:01,246
- What?
- No, Ma, not Mom.

46
00:02:01,314 --> 00:02:02,852
- What?
- Got any money?

47
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,293
I need to hit the drugstore
for some peroxide.

48
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,098
My girlfriend says my
tongue ring's infected again.

49
00:02:10,835 --> 00:02:13,976
Oh, God!
Get away from me, Kevin!

50
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:15,647
Pig.

51
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:17,519
Get a room, you two.

52
00:02:17,586 --> 00:02:19,359
It's like they never broke up.

53
00:02:25,538 --> 00:02:27,743
They grow up so fast.

54
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,748
That's why, well...

55
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,054
We haven't told
anyone else this, but...

56
00:02:32,621 --> 00:02:34,591
We're gonna have
another baby!

57
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:36,629
I had a feeling
when I saw you,

58
00:02:36,697 --> 00:02:37,766
but I didn't want
to say anything

59
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,236
in case you weren't pregnant.

60
00:02:39,304 --> 00:02:41,775
- That would be so embarrass.
- I'm not pregnant.

61
00:02:42,743 --> 00:02:44,348
I was talking about Trish.

62
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:46,419
I'm not either.

63
00:02:46,487 --> 00:02:48,357
See, Gerald?

64
00:02:48,425 --> 00:02:49,994
We're still trying
to get up the courage

65
00:02:50,062 --> 00:02:51,430
to ask a sperm donor.

66
00:02:51,498 --> 00:02:54,070
It's kind of an awkward
subject to broach.

67
00:02:54,138 --> 00:02:56,441
What about
Kevin's biological father?

68
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,746
Kevin was an accident.

69
00:02:58,814 --> 00:03:02,487
- How is that possible...
- You guys are great parents.

70
00:03:02,555 --> 00:03:05,394
I'm sure you'll have
no trouble finding a donor.

71
00:03:05,461 --> 00:03:08,467
We'd like it to be
someone we feel close to.

72
00:03:10,173 --> 00:03:11,976
I am so happy!

73
00:03:12,044 --> 00:03:14,416
Now, do you accept
competitors' coupons,

74
00:03:14,483 --> 00:03:17,621
and do you consider
a dry cleaner a competitor?

75
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,529
So, Gerald,

76
00:03:20,596 --> 00:03:23,067
what do you think about
Mo and Trish's proposition?

77
00:03:23,134 --> 00:03:25,203
Great, just great.
You know, I always say,

78
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,741
more gay couples
should have children.

79
00:03:27,809 --> 00:03:31,180
Yeah. If I were Kevin's moms,
I'd want a do-over, too.

80
00:03:31,248 --> 00:03:34,085
I'm so proud of you,
Gerald Goode.

81
00:03:34,153 --> 00:03:36,924
Well, thank you, but...

82
00:03:39,026 --> 00:03:42,194
Oh, my God!
Mo and Trish want my sperm!

83
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Sync by fant0m

84
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,800
I'm so excited!

85
00:04:09,993 --> 00:04:11,560
Giving a baby
to a gay couple

86
00:04:11,628 --> 00:04:14,794
is one of the greatest things
any human being can do.

87
00:04:14,862 --> 00:04:17,562
Margo's gonna crap herself
when I tell her.

88
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,596
Oh, God!
This is a nightmare!

89
00:04:19,664 --> 00:04:21,965
My ex-boyfriend is going
to be my half brother?

90
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:23,399
Are you trying
to screw me up?

91
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:25,302
We haven't really
decided yet.

92
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:26,604
Are you kidding?

93
00:04:26,672 --> 00:04:28,540
This is the kind of thing
you guys live for.

94
00:04:28,608 --> 00:04:31,343
Look at Mom right now!

95
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:33,145
I'd better find a way
to deal with Kevin.

96
00:04:33,213 --> 00:04:34,947
Let's keep this
between us.

97
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:38,451
Mo and Trish might not want
the whole neighborhood to know.

98
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:41,920
What do Mo and Trish not want
the whole neighborhood to know?

99
00:04:41,988 --> 00:04:44,356
Gerald is donating sperm
to our lesbian friends

100
00:04:44,423 --> 00:04:46,658
- so they could have a baby.
- Please, Helen!

101
00:04:46,726 --> 00:04:49,528
I know a place that gives you
70 bucks a visit.

102
00:04:49,595 --> 00:04:53,231
Paid for my truck and the
boat that's hitched to it.

103
00:04:53,299 --> 00:04:56,433
- That's a lot of visits.
- 70 dollars?

104
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:59,503
Did I hear you say you're
giving Mo and Trish a baby?

105
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,538
- We're not sure...
- Yes!

106
00:05:01,606 --> 00:05:04,808
If you give it to them, Gerald,
you can't take it back,

107
00:05:04,876 --> 00:05:07,544
like the watering can.

108
00:05:07,712 --> 00:05:09,779
Hey, if you guys
are just giving out babies,

109
00:05:09,847 --> 00:05:13,849
I'll take one. A child
will solve all my problems.

110
00:05:13,917 --> 00:05:16,686
<i>Go, go! Ubuntu needs
a new pair of clogs!</i>

111
00:05:18,787 --> 00:05:20,489
I win!

112
00:05:21,457 --> 00:05:23,659
- Grampa, call our bookie!
- I'm on it.

113
00:05:23,726 --> 00:05:27,661
Mom, dad, grampa's teaching me
how to invest in horses.

114
00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:30,130
Gambling on animals?

115
00:05:30,198 --> 00:05:32,466
Real men will gamble
on anything.

116
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:34,434
Charlie, I never gamble.

117
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:36,970
My point exactly.

118
00:05:37,538 --> 00:05:39,837
A real man grabs life
by the jabordnicks.

119
00:05:39,905 --> 00:05:42,005
He starts the day on the floor
of the drunk tank

120
00:05:42,073 --> 00:05:43,540
and ends it on a bed
in a bordello.

121
00:05:43,607 --> 00:05:45,742
He gets a hernia,
and he doesn't get it treated

122
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,113
- until his stomach drops
out of his thigh. - Cool.

123
00:05:50,181 --> 00:05:53,283
A real man gives lesbians his
seed to father a child for them,

124
00:05:53,351 --> 00:05:56,386
- like Gerald is doing for
Mo and Trish. - Helen!

125
00:05:56,454 --> 00:05:57,988
That's so awesome!

126
00:05:58,056 --> 00:06:00,591
No, it isn't!
Strippers are awesome!

127
00:06:00,658 --> 00:06:02,659
I'm gonna have
a little half brother!

128
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:04,229
I need to make him a card.

129
00:06:06,731 --> 00:06:08,932
Are you sure that being
a donor for Mo and Trish

130
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,467
is the right thing to do?

131
00:06:10,534 --> 00:06:13,336
Gerald, this is the perfect
way to show Ubuntu

132
00:06:13,403 --> 00:06:16,004
that real manhood
is not about selfishness

133
00:06:16,072 --> 00:06:17,838
but about selflessness.

134
00:06:17,906 --> 00:06:20,106
You'll get absolutely
no pleasure,

135
00:06:20,174 --> 00:06:22,175
but potential
responsibilities.

136
00:06:22,243 --> 00:06:24,510
Talk about leading
by example, huh?

137
00:06:24,578 --> 00:06:29,378
- Well, that does sound right.
- Helen! This should interest you.

138
00:06:29,445 --> 00:06:32,680
The Greenville Art council
just tapped me to curate

139
00:06:32,748 --> 00:06:34,882
this year's irreverent
and courageous...

140
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,884
Gerald is giving his sperm
to our lesbian friends

141
00:06:36,952 --> 00:06:38,919
so they can have a baby!

142
00:06:41,654 --> 00:06:44,856
Damn it, Kent!
I can't do everything!

143
00:06:59,405 --> 00:07:01,604
Kevin, we need to talk.

144
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:03,472
I just wanted to say
some things have changed,

145
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,841
and I think we should try
to be, like, friends,

146
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:09,044
You know, in case we ever
become related or something.

147
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:11,779
- So you want to marry me?
- No!

148
00:07:11,847 --> 00:07:13,180
How about you get
the hell out of here

149
00:07:13,248 --> 00:07:14,482
before I bust you up?

150
00:07:14,549 --> 00:07:17,584
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Kiss!

151
00:07:17,652 --> 00:07:19,520
Fight! Fight! Fight!

152
00:07:19,588 --> 00:07:22,323
Look!
Nitro-burning funny cars!

153
00:07:25,392 --> 00:07:26,459
Hey, guys!

154
00:07:26,527 --> 00:07:28,428
Mo, put on some pants.

155
00:07:28,495 --> 00:07:31,296
Gerald and Helen are here,
and they brought booze!

156
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:34,533
Mo, Trish,
we have good news.

157
00:07:34,601 --> 00:07:38,003
Helen and I have
discussed it, and, well,

158
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:41,606
our answer is... Yes!

159
00:07:44,741 --> 00:07:46,176
Yes to what?

160
00:07:46,544 --> 00:07:49,212
To what?
Well, to giving you a baby.

161
00:07:51,981 --> 00:07:53,715
Gerald, no offense,

162
00:07:53,783 --> 00:07:57,050
but we may not want
to have a girl.

163
00:07:57,118 --> 00:08:00,620
No, we're looking for
a man's man. No offense.

164
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:03,288
Well, I appreciate that
you keep saying "no offense",

165
00:08:03,356 --> 00:08:06,557
but it might be easier if you
just stopped insulting me.

166
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:09,826
I'm confused.
You said it was awkward to ask.

167
00:08:10,894 --> 00:08:13,264
And gettin' more
awkward by the minute.

168
00:08:22,463 --> 00:08:24,064
Not a man's man?

169
00:08:24,132 --> 00:08:26,200
I get hit on by men
all the time.

170
00:08:26,268 --> 00:08:28,669
They're talking nonsense,
Gerald. They're lesbians.

171
00:08:28,737 --> 00:08:31,072
Their view of masculinity
is skewed.

172
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:33,740
The important thing is
that Ubuntu can't find out,

173
00:08:33,808 --> 00:08:36,176
or we'll lose him
to Charlie forever.

174
00:08:36,244 --> 00:08:37,377
Find out what?

175
00:08:37,445 --> 00:08:38,345
Nothing.

176
00:08:38,413 --> 00:08:40,213
Mo and Trish don't think
I'm manly enough

177
00:08:40,281 --> 00:08:42,048
to give them a baby.

178
00:08:42,116 --> 00:08:43,951
Isn't that crazy?

179
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,052
- Isn't it?
- I don't know, Gerald.

180
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:50,053
You do wear women's jeans.

181
00:08:50,121 --> 00:08:51,788
Well, I have a wide pelvis.

182
00:08:51,856 --> 00:08:55,258
Gerald, you carry
pepper spray in your bag.

183
00:08:55,325 --> 00:08:59,028
So no one thinks I'm manly?
Penny?

184
00:08:59,096 --> 00:09:02,798
Well, you always treat me
with respect and equality...

185
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:05,066
You know, like a sissy.

186
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:10,371
Hi, mom! Hi, dad!

187
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:13,106
Were Mo and Trish super happy
about having your baby?

188
00:09:13,174 --> 00:09:17,008
Well, Ubuntu,
let's just say...

189
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:19,343
Yes! They were
downright giddy.

190
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:21,212
So, Ubuntu,
ready to get shaving?

191
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,314
Because your father
is ready to teach you.

192
00:09:23,381 --> 00:09:25,616
- Yes. Let's go!
- He can't shave yet!

193
00:09:25,684 --> 00:09:27,885
He has to wait till the beard
and mustache connect.

194
00:09:27,953 --> 00:09:30,020
Every guy knows that.

195
00:09:30,087 --> 00:09:31,520
Women are like underwear.

196
00:09:31,588 --> 00:09:33,756
You should change them
every three days.

197
00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:36,892
Gerald, this is terrible.
We can't let this happen.

198
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,461
Can you imagine
if that old buzzard

199
00:09:38,528 --> 00:09:41,430
gets his talons
into our Ubuntu?

200
00:09:55,308 --> 00:09:57,876
Sell! Buy! Sell! Buy!

201
00:09:57,944 --> 00:09:59,344
Sell, buy, sell, buy!

202
00:10:03,881 --> 00:10:05,716
Oh, God!
What do we do?

203
00:10:05,784 --> 00:10:07,652
There's only one thing
that's gonna trump Charlie,

204
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:09,087
and we know what that is.

205
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:11,656
You have to father
Mo and Trish's baby.

206
00:10:11,724 --> 00:10:14,926
- But they don't want to
have my baby. - Oh, they will.

207
00:10:27,369 --> 00:10:28,969
I feel silly, Helen.

208
00:10:29,037 --> 00:10:32,703
Listen, Gerald, your job
is to stay silent and nod.

209
00:10:32,771 --> 00:10:34,505
And put this
down your pants.

210
00:10:34,573 --> 00:10:36,240
Helen, size doesn't matter.

211
00:10:36,308 --> 00:10:38,809
You explained that to me
on our fourth date.

212
00:10:38,877 --> 00:10:42,912
I know that, and you know that,
but lesbians don't know that.

213
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,614
Now do it! For Ubuntu.

214
00:10:53,588 --> 00:10:54,887
Hey, Helen!

215
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:58,456
Gerald, is that you?

216
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:00,424
Is everything okay
with the tires?

217
00:11:00,492 --> 00:11:01,959
The tires are fine.

218
00:11:02,027 --> 00:11:03,428
But after we got home
last night,

219
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:05,296
Gerald and I kind of
ruined the shocks,

220
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:06,830
if you know what I mean.

221
00:11:07,198 --> 00:11:08,799
We had car sex.

222
00:11:12,202 --> 00:11:13,737
That's his mating call.

223
00:11:13,805 --> 00:11:15,805
Not now, big guy.

224
00:11:20,444 --> 00:11:22,278
He's probably gonna see
if the vending machine

225
00:11:22,345 --> 00:11:24,480
has beer or tools.

226
00:11:24,548 --> 00:11:26,616
Men and their tools...

227
00:11:34,357 --> 00:11:35,958
Is that a squash?

228
00:11:41,363 --> 00:11:44,498
Yo, Ubuntu, I think
your sister's still into me.

229
00:11:44,565 --> 00:11:47,800
Really? You should date her.
She's a wonderful person.

230
00:11:47,868 --> 00:11:50,836
Yeah, but I'm still
chilling with Amber.

231
00:11:50,904 --> 00:11:52,373
She buys me stuff.

232
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,542
My grampa says a real man can
have as many girls as he wants.

233
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:59,879
God put them on Earth
to make men happy.

234
00:11:59,947 --> 00:12:02,047
I do deserve to be happy.

235
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:07,886
See you, daddy!

236
00:12:07,953 --> 00:12:09,520
Grampa's taking me
to the newsstand.

237
00:12:09,588 --> 00:12:10,555
So I can decide what

238
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,290
my gentlemen's magazine
of choice is going to be.

239
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,392
I like "Dwell", but...

240
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,662
We're talking about
nudie magazines, Gerald.

241
00:12:18,729 --> 00:12:20,763
Bye, dad.

242
00:12:20,831 --> 00:12:23,600
I used to get
"Chocolate Nurse" magazine,

243
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:25,535
but they heavily edited
my letters,

244
00:12:25,603 --> 00:12:27,937
so I canceled
my subscription.

245
00:12:31,507 --> 00:12:33,808
I feel so lost, Helen.

246
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,742
I know Charlie
isn't the answer

247
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:37,743
to showing Ubuntu
how to be a man,

248
00:12:37,811 --> 00:12:40,246
but now I'm not sure
I am, either.

249
00:12:40,813 --> 00:12:42,981
I'm gonna
go draw a bath.

250
00:12:43,049 --> 00:12:45,750
Stop right there, Gerald!
You are a man.

251
00:12:45,818 --> 00:12:47,619
You've just lost
your confidence.

252
00:12:49,088 --> 00:12:51,690
But I know how
you're gonna get it back.

253
00:12:52,858 --> 00:12:54,458
A drum circle?

254
00:12:54,526 --> 00:12:56,894
At the learning annex!

255
00:12:56,962 --> 00:12:58,462
"Reawaken your manhood

256
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:01,964
with the ancient native american
art of drum circling."

257
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:05,334
They teach you how to summon
the mighty eagle inside of you.

258
00:13:05,402 --> 00:13:07,903
You're always saying
how you want to do that.

259
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:10,906
Oh, that does sound good.

260
00:13:18,713 --> 00:13:20,548
Is this everybody?

261
00:13:20,615 --> 00:13:23,749
This is it. You ready
to unleash your inner man?

262
00:13:23,817 --> 00:13:26,618
Okay, let's go back in time,

263
00:13:26,686 --> 00:13:30,554
when men sat in circles
and told tales of the hunt.

264
00:13:30,622 --> 00:13:32,323
And if you need to go
to the bathroom,

265
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,425
you don't need
to raise your hand.

266
00:13:41,266 --> 00:13:43,299
Oh, easy, friend.

267
00:13:43,367 --> 00:13:45,402
You want to leave yourself
somewhere to go.

268
00:13:45,469 --> 00:13:47,237
Wow, I'm really digging this.

269
00:13:47,304 --> 00:13:50,007
It's so raw, so tribal.

270
00:13:50,075 --> 00:13:52,543
- Who are we?
- We are men!

271
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:55,345
Yes. Yes, I am a man!

272
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,115
Good news, Bliss.

273
00:13:59,182 --> 00:14:02,417
- We're back on. - What?
I'm not interested in you.

274
00:14:02,485 --> 00:14:05,419
But are you interested in
taking a shower with me?

275
00:14:05,487 --> 00:14:07,721
You're not listening
to me, Kevin.

276
00:14:07,788 --> 00:14:09,322
I hate you.

277
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,493
There's a fine line
between love and hate.

278
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:13,628
No, there's not.
You are so vile.

279
00:14:13,696 --> 00:14:15,931
And now we kiss.

280
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:23,171
Bliss? Bliss!

281
00:14:25,274 --> 00:14:27,375
Hey, Amber!

282
00:14:27,443 --> 00:14:29,944
I guess we'll just keep it
you and me for now.

283
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:40,387
It was amazing, Helen.

284
00:14:40,454 --> 00:14:42,888
I felt so alive
in that circle.

285
00:14:42,956 --> 00:14:45,925
You seem different.
You even smell different.

286
00:14:48,561 --> 00:14:50,797
I'd say musky.

287
00:14:51,465 --> 00:14:55,366
Gerald, Ubuntu needs to see you
drum in all your primal glory.

288
00:14:55,434 --> 00:14:57,401
Charlie can never
compete with that.

289
00:14:57,469 --> 00:14:59,803
You're right.
Gambling and pornography

290
00:14:59,871 --> 00:15:02,839
have nothing on the ancient
rhythms of the forest.

291
00:15:06,643 --> 00:15:08,778
Nice face paint, Chad.

292
00:15:08,846 --> 00:15:11,547
Hey, did you finally tell your
boss how you feel, Timothy?

293
00:15:11,614 --> 00:15:12,749
You will.

294
00:15:13,216 --> 00:15:16,018
Hey, Franklin, we have to
hit the skins hard today.

295
00:15:16,086 --> 00:15:19,053
My son's coming straight from
football practice to watch us.

296
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,755
Damn. And my carpal
tunnel acting up.

297
00:15:21,823 --> 00:15:23,890
Drum it away, Franklin.
Drum it away.

298
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,926
Okay, men, let's hit it!

299
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:30,063
Step it up, boys.
Drum like thunder!

300
00:15:30,131 --> 00:15:31,731
Now we're hittin' it.

301
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:33,100
Ladies!

302
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:35,036
We're in the spreadsheet
class next door,

303
00:15:35,103 --> 00:15:37,604
and we can't hear
ourselves think.

304
00:15:37,672 --> 00:15:41,141
So bring down the tippy-tappy
to a pitter-patter. You got it?

305
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:44,611
Sorry!
It won't happen again.

306
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:50,783
Wait.
We're in a drum circle class.

307
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,985
We shouldn't
have to keep it down.

308
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:55,187
Oh, yeah? I say you do.

309
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,758
So I'm gonna adjust
your volume control.

310
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:02,192
He done knocked
a hole in your drum.

311
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,428
What do you say? Your inner man
want to do something about it?

312
00:16:05,696 --> 00:16:07,130
Huh? Does it?

313
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:13,167
No.

314
00:16:13,235 --> 00:16:15,836
No, I'm sorry.
We'll keep it down.

315
00:16:15,904 --> 00:16:17,304
Thought so.

316
00:16:23,477 --> 00:16:26,880
Oh, God! You guys are gonna
"eyes wide shut" me, aren't you?

317
00:16:26,948 --> 00:16:30,149
Dad! I'm connected.
I'm ready to shave.

318
00:16:31,052 --> 00:16:33,019
Teach me. Teach me!

319
00:16:35,923 --> 00:16:37,657
Go with your grandfather.

320
00:16:37,725 --> 00:16:40,259
He can teach you
what you need to know.

321
00:16:51,903 --> 00:16:54,371
So how did it go?
Did Ubuntu like it?

322
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:56,473
I'm sure he was...

323
00:16:58,341 --> 00:16:59,608
What happened?

324
00:17:00,176 --> 00:17:02,744
Some spreadsheet bullies
broke my drum,

325
00:17:02,812 --> 00:17:04,879
and I didn't
do anything about it.

326
00:17:05,447 --> 00:17:08,116
Well, restraint and pacifism

327
00:17:08,183 --> 00:17:11,053
- are manly attributes...
- Don't, Helen!

328
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,688
<i>Now, in a few years,</i>

329
00:17:13,756 --> 00:17:16,290
<i>you'll need to learn
how to shave drunk.</i>

330
00:17:21,895 --> 00:17:24,597
Mo? Trish? What are
you guys doing here?

331
00:17:24,664 --> 00:17:28,466
Sorry, Gerald. Kevin climbed up
your tree and won't come down.

332
00:17:28,534 --> 00:17:30,934
And I'm not coming down
until Bliss takes me back!

333
00:17:31,502 --> 00:17:32,569
Or Amber.

334
00:17:32,637 --> 00:17:36,305
We've never seen him like this.
We don't know what to do.

335
00:17:36,373 --> 00:17:39,742
We can't burn him out.
Can we?

336
00:17:41,345 --> 00:17:42,444
Ubuntu!

337
00:17:42,512 --> 00:17:44,579
You said I could have
as many girls as I wanted.

338
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:47,081
- Now I have none!
- You said that?

339
00:17:47,148 --> 00:17:49,681
That's what grampa told me.
Right, grampa?

340
00:17:49,749 --> 00:17:51,283
Damn straight.

341
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,351
Now, I may not know
everything about women,

342
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:57,120
but I do know that
that is dead wrong.

343
00:17:57,187 --> 00:18:00,955
You should always treat women
with respect and as individuals.

344
00:18:01,022 --> 00:18:02,155
Now come on down.

345
00:18:02,223 --> 00:18:03,890
I'm not coming down!

346
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,725
My heart is broke
over Bliss... Or Amber.

347
00:18:09,362 --> 00:18:13,097
Kevin, I know you think you're
angry, but you really aren't.

348
00:18:13,165 --> 00:18:15,899
What you're feeling
is sad and rejected.

349
00:18:15,967 --> 00:18:18,302
But those are scarier
feelings to let out,

350
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:19,837
aren't they?

351
00:18:19,904 --> 00:18:21,171
Yes.

352
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:22,873
It's okay, Kevin.

353
00:18:22,941 --> 00:18:26,378
I always tell Ubuntu that
it takes real courage to cry,

354
00:18:26,446 --> 00:18:29,114
- especially for a man.
- Oh, God!

355
00:18:29,382 --> 00:18:30,983
Go ahead. Let it out.

356
00:18:33,552 --> 00:18:35,421
I want to come down.

357
00:18:38,991 --> 00:18:41,892
I don't want to be alone.
I want to be with Bliss...

358
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,927
Or Amber.

359
00:18:42,995 --> 00:18:45,562
Kevin, if you learn how to
make a girl feel special,

360
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:48,565
you will never need to
worry about being alone.

361
00:18:48,633 --> 00:18:53,368
But you really do need to
decide between Amber or Bliss.

362
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:54,869
What? No.

363
00:18:55,537 --> 00:18:58,672
I strongly suggest Amber.

364
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:02,608
Amber!

365
00:19:04,177 --> 00:19:07,245
Wow, Gerald,
that was... Impressive.

366
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,281
Manly, even?

367
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:12,284
In a weird way, yes.

368
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:15,153
You know, we realize we have
our hands full with Kevin,

369
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:18,322
and we'll probably be
raising a baby of his anyway,

370
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,423
so we're not gonna have
another of our own.

371
00:19:20,491 --> 00:19:21,891
But if we did,

372
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:26,028
you'd be the type of man
we'd want to be the donor.

373
00:19:26,096 --> 00:19:28,963
- Really? - Would you two
mind telling Margo that?

374
00:19:29,031 --> 00:19:31,598
Come on, Ubuntu,
let's leave these crybabies.

375
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,367
It's time to shave.

376
00:19:33,935 --> 00:19:36,437
No, Charlie!
Ubuntu is my son.

377
00:19:36,504 --> 00:19:38,171
I'll shave him.

378
00:19:46,212 --> 00:19:49,481
Now, the first step
when shaving is to exfoliate.

379
00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:52,184
Exfoliate. Got it.
With what?

380
00:19:52,251 --> 00:19:55,486
Well, chamomile
is not just for tea, son.

381
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:02,793
Let's turn it up a notch!

382
00:20:02,861 --> 00:20:05,028
What about
the spreadsheet guys?

383
00:20:05,096 --> 00:20:07,163
Oh, I'm not worried
about them.

384
00:20:09,866 --> 00:20:12,734
They come on Wednesdays
and Fridays.

385
00:20:12,802 --> 00:20:15,237
Then I'm taking my shirt off.

386
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
