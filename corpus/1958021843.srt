1
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,013
You got
a hitch in your giddy-up.

2
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:34,448
And that can feel never-ending.

3
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:39,087
But when that overwhelming
urge to self-medicate hits you,

4
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,521
that is exactly

5
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:42,557
when you need to
lean on someone for help.

6
00:03:43,124 --> 00:03:44,559
It's the only way forward.

7
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:47,528
You need someone
to help pull you back

8
00:03:47,662 --> 00:03:49,130
on the healthier path.

9
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:52,332
And that someone
can be a family member,

10
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:54,669
a neighbor, an old friend...

11
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,838
a new friend.

12
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:59,941
You know, maybe someone
in this very group.

13
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:03,310
So, we have all been there.

14
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,614
We are all still there.

15
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:10,585
And we are all facing
the same four tasks.

16
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:14,989
One, to accept
the reality of the loss.

17
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,159
Anyone want to continue
with the next one?

18
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,293
To experience the pain of grief.

19
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,898
And the third?

20
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,365
Ronnie?

21
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:28,569
Adjust to an environment
where the deceased is missing.

22
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:31,438
And the fourth.

23
00:04:31,806 --> 00:04:34,842
To emotionally relocate
the deceased and move on.

24
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:36,577
Right.

25
00:04:38,146 --> 00:04:39,781
We all share these tasks.

26
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:43,184
And we all understand
at least an element

27
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,752
of what you are going through.

28
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,955
This is what binds us together.

29
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:52,994
All right, that's about all
the time we have for tonight.

30
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:56,030
Um, does anyone wanna
add anything before we go?

31
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:00,333
Will?

32
00:05:02,904 --> 00:05:04,138
How about you?

33
00:05:04,272 --> 00:05:06,339
You've been quiet.
You wanna share something?

34
00:05:07,175 --> 00:05:08,441
Uh.

35
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:10,711
No.

36
00:05:11,913 --> 00:05:13,681
I don't have anything
at the moment.

37
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,418
Of course. In your own time.

38
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:21,088
All right, well, that does it.

39
00:05:21,222 --> 00:05:22,489
Oh, uh, and just a reminder

40
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:23,991
for those of you
with court orders,

41
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,358
see me afterwards

42
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,794
and I will get them
signed for you.

43
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,465
See you tomorrow.

44
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:35,837
- Ronnie. Always a pleasure.
- Thanks.

45
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,370
Take care.

46
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:40,241
Lydia,

47
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:43,044
I think that you can work
a little harder to participate

48
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,912
I am doing
the best I can, child.

49
00:05:45,046 --> 00:05:46,848
You have more,
you have great things to share.

50
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:48,415
All right, that's fine.
You signed it? Thank you.

51
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:49,984
Yeah, I just wish--

52
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:04,198
You know, I like to keep
groups like this small.

53
00:06:04,332 --> 00:06:05,398
More intimate.

54
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:07,467
I find it makes
people feel more comfortable

55
00:06:07,602 --> 00:06:09,469
expressing themselves.

56
00:06:10,171 --> 00:06:11,438
Speaking their truth.

57
00:06:13,241 --> 00:06:14,675
Do you like small groups, Will?

58
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:18,913
Yeah. Works for me, I guess.

59
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,117
I certainly hope so.

60
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:41,535
Hey, Will, hold up.

61
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:44,105
Need a ride someplace?

62
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:46,574
-No, I'm good.
-I'm Bryan, by the way.

63
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:49,844
Yeah, I remember.
From the meeting.

64
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,680
-I'm gonna head out.
-It's a group.

65
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:55,816
We're a group. It's a group.

66
00:06:57,018 --> 00:06:59,486
-Yeah, okay.
-Well, you called it a meeting.

67
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,222
And a meeting could be

68
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:03,357
different factions coming
together for a brief period,

69
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,793
but a group
functions as a whole.

70
00:07:06,227 --> 00:07:08,162
We help each other.
We're a group.

71
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,463
Right.

72
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:13,167
So, Bella wants us
to call it a group

73
00:07:13,301 --> 00:07:14,568
and that's what you're saying?

74
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,074
See you next time. In group.

75
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:21,188
<i>♪ You can find it anywhere ♪</i>

00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:27,761

<i>You need to wake up, brother.</i>

82
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,515
Living one day at a time.

83
00:11:53,648 --> 00:11:54,815
Give you a ride?

84
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:58,052
Enjoying one moment at a time.

85
00:11:59,688 --> 00:12:02,223
Living one day at a time.

86
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:04,825
Enjoying one moment at a time.

87
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,962
Enjoying one moment at a time.

88
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:12,099
Accepting hardship
as a pathway to peace.

89
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:17,706
Accepting hardship
as a pathway to peace.

90
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:20,941
Taking this world as it is.

91
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:23,310
Not as I would have it.

92
00:12:23,444 --> 00:12:24,812
I gotta keep asking.

93
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:27,281
Not as I would have it.

94
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:29,483
Not as I would have it.

95
00:12:29,984 --> 00:12:33,555
Trusting that you
will make all things right.

96
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:38,092
So that I may be
reasonably happy in this life.

97
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:41,095
-In this life.
-Bon appétit.

98
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:42,496
In this life.

99
00:12:42,631 --> 00:12:45,232
And supremely happy forever.

100
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:49,504
Forever. Forever. Forever.

101
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:54,208
Forever. Forever,
forever, forever.

102
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:56,143
Forever.

103
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:02,517
<i>And that's...</i>

104
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:09,323
Denial. Anger.

105
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,493
Bargaining. Depression.

106
00:13:13,695 --> 00:13:14,928
Acceptance.

107
00:13:15,664 --> 00:13:17,264
As difficult as it may seem,

108
00:13:17,398 --> 00:13:18,799
it is important
to remind ourselves

109
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:19,967
that these five
stages of grief--

110
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,368
Bargaining.

111
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:25,272
That's the one that keeps
sending me down the rabbit hole.

112
00:13:25,674 --> 00:13:27,808
It's like every second

113
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:30,177
of every waking hour,
it's just...

114
00:13:31,345 --> 00:13:33,347
-I just keep going through the--
-The what-ifs.

115
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,750
Yeah, right,
the fucking what-ifs.

116
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:38,319
Like, what if--
what if we had left

117
00:13:38,452 --> 00:13:40,087
five minutes later

118
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,557
instead of always insisting that
we leave five minutes early?

119
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:44,491
Should be a sixth stage.

120
00:13:46,594 --> 00:13:48,596
A sixth stage to grief?

121
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:52,399
Reversal.

122
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:57,171
I-- I'm not sure
we understand, Lydia.

123
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,175
What if you could reverse it?

124
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,045
Okay, so, this
is what bargaining is about.

125
00:14:05,613 --> 00:14:08,082
You're bartering with yourself
in your own head

126
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:09,551
in an attempt
to change something

127
00:14:09,684 --> 00:14:11,085
that cannot be changed.

128
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:14,221
- But what if there was a way?
- Lydia.

129
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:16,591
There are those what-ifs again

130
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:19,527
and that is
a dangerous game to play.

131
00:14:23,798 --> 00:14:25,065
Yeah.

132
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,634
Whatever you say.

133
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:51,125
Okay, that was a very--

134
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,200
Will.

135
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,210
Something on your mind?

136
00:15:11,813 --> 00:15:13,046
It just seems to me that

137
00:15:13,548 --> 00:15:17,050
if there's five stages
to this thing then...

138
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:19,521
I don't know, it just seems to--

139
00:15:19,654 --> 00:15:22,322
to close our minds
to other options.

140
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:24,526
Other options?

141
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:28,162
Options, stages, levels,
I don't know, uh,

142
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:29,564
just seems to limit us.

143
00:15:29,697 --> 00:15:31,666
Well, Will,
I appreciate the, uh,

144
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,569
many levels of your opinion,

145
00:15:34,702 --> 00:15:37,938
I can assure you that
what Lydia is dealing with is--

146
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,473
Not talking about her.

147
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:41,975
Uh-oh.

148
00:15:42,777 --> 00:15:45,847
-Unsatisfied customer?
-Oh, no. Not at all.

149
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:48,683
Uh, Will was just
expressing concern for Lydia.

150
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:50,984
- Oh.
- Oh.

151
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:52,352
Thank you, Will.

152
00:15:52,754 --> 00:15:54,488
Take that all
into consideration.

153
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:25,620
Almost like they
don't want us to get better.

154
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:29,323
How about you?

155
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:33,126
-You feeling any better yet?
-Not really.

156
00:16:33,728 --> 00:16:35,996
No, not at all.

157
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:40,167
You're not like the others.

158
00:16:40,969 --> 00:16:42,236
I could tell.

159
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,739
So, why are you stuck here?

160
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:48,041
My heart got ripped open.

161
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:51,345
I was sad.

162
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,548
Then angry.

163
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:56,483
And sad again.

164
00:16:57,952 --> 00:16:59,687
Then angry all the time.

165
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,291
Shit happened.

166
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:09,631
And they thought
I needed some group time

167
00:17:09,764 --> 00:17:10,932
to get my head right.

168
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,134
- Is it working?
- No.

169
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:17,872
I'm horrible.

170
00:17:18,405 --> 00:17:20,107
Constantly horrible.

171
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:24,411
But I'mma get better on my own.

172
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:26,781
I'mma feel better.

173
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:29,584
Real soon.

174
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:31,451
100%.

175
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:36,056
I'mma see my baby again.

176
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:37,892
Let me give you a ride.

177
00:17:38,693 --> 00:17:41,194
Come on.
I could use the company.

178
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:44,632
No, I'm good.
Could use the exercise.

179
00:17:44,766 --> 00:17:47,635
All right, well, suit yourself.
I can take a hint.

180
00:17:49,904 --> 00:17:52,372
I'll see you in group.

181
00:17:53,007 --> 00:17:54,642
There you go, you got it.

182
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,779
See you in group, friend.

184
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:26,834
Bon appétit.

185
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:37,078
<i>♪ Together,</i>
<i>how I find my own way down ♪</i>

186
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:42,650

187
00:19:55,963 --> 00:19:57,230
Ah!

188
00:20:01,002 --> 00:20:02,937
<i>You need to wake up, brother.</i>

189
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:37,805
You see it.
All the time, every day.

190
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,777
After a while, death,
or the finality of it, you know.

191
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:46,514
Just doesn't quite
pack the punch it used to.

192
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:48,616
And that day
was like any other day.

193
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,852
I-- I had already seen misery.

194
00:20:51,586 --> 00:20:52,954
Already seen death.

195
00:20:54,222 --> 00:20:55,890
All in a day's work, right?

196
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,730
So, I'm on my way home
and I get one last call.

197
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,602
And three blocks
from the house...

198
00:21:09,637 --> 00:21:12,507
it was a single car collision,

199
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,576
one person,
I was third on the scene.

200
00:21:17,712 --> 00:21:19,180
I get there and I-- I--

201
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:21,916
I make my way
down the embankment.

202
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,553
It didn't look
that bad, you know?

203
00:21:26,087 --> 00:21:29,090
Just upside down there and--

204
00:21:29,223 --> 00:21:30,725
and the creek bed--

205
00:21:30,858 --> 00:21:34,394
Dunbar Creek, uh, you know,
ankle deep, usually.

206
00:21:36,931 --> 00:21:39,667
But shit, we had all
that rain the night before.

207
00:21:42,837 --> 00:21:45,640
It was like
God turned on the faucet,

208
00:21:45,773 --> 00:21:47,374
forgot to turn it off, you know?

209
00:21:50,745 --> 00:21:52,412
She never had a chance.

210
00:21:53,514 --> 00:21:54,782
She hit her head.

211
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,488
She's just hanging there
upside down and

212
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:04,525
her head in the water.

213
00:22:10,198 --> 00:22:11,933
All that life ahead of her.

214
00:22:17,305 --> 00:22:18,573
That was the one.

215
00:22:19,507 --> 00:22:21,374
That was the one
that got stuck right here.

216
00:22:26,247 --> 00:22:27,515
That was the one.

217
00:22:31,418 --> 00:22:32,687
Thank you, Bryan.

218
00:22:34,288 --> 00:22:37,225
That was very brave and
you are wonderful for sharing.

219
00:22:43,297 --> 00:22:45,933
Insanity is doing
the same thing over and over

220
00:22:46,067 --> 00:22:47,668
and expecting
a different result.

221
00:22:48,135 --> 00:22:51,272
Now, that's often misattributed
to Mr. Albert Einstein,

222
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:52,874
but the point is clear.

223
00:22:53,674 --> 00:22:55,042
I know that

224
00:22:55,176 --> 00:22:57,678
dealing with
overwhelming grief day after day

225
00:22:57,812 --> 00:22:59,780
can make you feel
like you are insane.

226
00:23:00,281 --> 00:23:02,650
And we all know what
the result is going to be

227
00:23:02,783 --> 00:23:05,553
when we express
our grief to each other.

228
00:23:06,287 --> 00:23:09,056
A little bit of relief,
no matter how brief,

229
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,092
from the guilt,

230
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:13,327
anger, sadness,

231
00:23:13,828 --> 00:23:15,963
whatever it is that
we are feeling inside.

232
00:23:16,097 --> 00:23:17,598
Now, let me be clear.

233
00:23:17,732 --> 00:23:20,768
There is nothing
wrong with temporary relief.

234
00:23:21,636 --> 00:23:23,971
No matter what stage we are at.

235
00:23:27,942 --> 00:23:31,178
But if you begin to
live life only for that relief,

236
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,849
for the next blackout
from reality,

237
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:38,719
you are not learning.
You're not growing.

238
00:23:39,754 --> 00:23:41,155
You are not healing.

239
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:43,557
So, to make Einstein,

240
00:23:43,691 --> 00:23:45,259
or whoever said
that quote happy,

241
00:23:45,793 --> 00:23:47,628
We're going to do something
a little different.

242
00:23:47,995 --> 00:23:50,765
Instead of expressing
our grief to each other,

243
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:54,101
we are going to
write a note or a letter

244
00:23:55,303 --> 00:23:56,570
to our departed.

245
00:24:01,142 --> 00:24:03,476
Something you
want to add, Lydia?

246
00:24:05,478 --> 00:24:08,015
No. I'm all set.

247
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:10,952
Not interested in
breaking the cycle, Lydia?

248
00:24:12,887 --> 00:24:15,122
I'm almost done
with my cycle forever.

249
00:24:15,256 --> 00:24:16,524
Thanks.

250
00:24:16,657 --> 00:24:18,092
What's that supposed to mean?

251
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:20,895
Sounds like lady problems to me.

252
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:24,865
Stupid motherfuckas.

253
00:25:03,704 --> 00:25:05,940
-Good to see you.
-So you almost there?

254
00:25:07,074 --> 00:25:09,810
-You feeling better?
-Damn right.

255
00:25:10,478 --> 00:25:12,113
The shit ends tomorrow.

256
00:25:12,713 --> 00:25:13,981
Take care, Sam.

257
00:25:15,716 --> 00:25:17,618
- See you outside.
- Yeah.

258
00:25:33,734 --> 00:25:35,069
Something I can
help you with, man?

259
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:37,071
Because if this is
about a ride, I'm good.

260
00:25:37,204 --> 00:25:39,740
Brother, you're stuck
in a shit cycle right now,

261
00:25:39,874 --> 00:25:41,842
going round and round and round,

262
00:25:41,976 --> 00:25:44,245
and nowhere in that circle
is the starting point

263
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:45,446
to the healing process.

264
00:25:46,013 --> 00:25:47,548
You don't know
anything about me.

265
00:25:47,681 --> 00:25:49,150
I know what those
cough drops are for.

266
00:25:50,051 --> 00:25:52,153
And that is not the answer.
That much I know.

267
00:25:52,286 --> 00:25:54,855
Brother, waking life,
it can be tolerable.

268
00:25:54,989 --> 00:25:56,724
Not perfect, but tolerable.

269
00:25:56,857 --> 00:25:59,827
But it starts by getting
out of the circle of despair.

270
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:03,931
It sure sounds like
you had that memorized.

271
00:26:05,733 --> 00:26:07,001
So, let me guess.

272
00:26:07,536 --> 00:26:08,903
It's vodka on the way in

273
00:26:09,036 --> 00:26:10,838
because it has
the weakest scent, right?

274
00:26:11,506 --> 00:26:13,107
Then pop a few menthols

275
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,143
and you're on cruise control
through a whole new group.

276
00:26:16,644 --> 00:26:17,611
Right?

277
00:26:17,745 --> 00:26:19,013
And on the way home,

278
00:26:19,146 --> 00:26:21,782
pick up a bottle
of your favorite stuff.

279
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,351
Just to get you
through the night.

280
00:26:24,618 --> 00:26:25,653
Am I getting warmer?

281
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,156
I mean, I was just trying
to check off the boxes, okay?

282
00:26:29,623 --> 00:26:31,158
Taking it one day at a time.

283
00:26:32,726 --> 00:26:34,995
One day at a time.

284
00:26:37,264 --> 00:26:38,799
That's the secret sauce.

285
00:26:43,572 --> 00:26:44,839
Time.

286
00:26:47,608 --> 00:26:50,010
It can be your best friend
or your worst enemy, Will.

287
00:26:50,478 --> 00:26:51,445
You decide.

288
00:27:00,154 --> 00:27:04,024
Yeah. Time could
be your best friend.

289
00:27:04,825 --> 00:27:06,927
If you lay down
and let her fuck you.

290
00:27:07,862 --> 00:27:09,096
But not me.

291
00:27:09,531 --> 00:27:12,700
You wanna stop living in
their dream world of despair?

292
00:27:14,034 --> 00:27:15,570
What do you mean? Like drugs?

293
00:27:16,103 --> 00:27:18,038
I'm talking about
not living with the reality

294
00:27:18,172 --> 00:27:20,007
they keep preaching to us.

295
00:27:20,609 --> 00:27:21,876
You interested?

296
00:27:23,277 --> 00:27:24,345
Yes.

297
00:27:29,416 --> 00:27:30,751
There's this place

298
00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:33,287
hidden away.

299
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:38,826
Follow these directions.

300
00:27:39,528 --> 00:27:41,028
Go to that place.

301
00:27:41,962 --> 00:27:43,697
Tell 'em I sent you.

302
00:27:46,934 --> 00:27:49,236
Go to that place, Will.

303
00:27:51,805 --> 00:27:55,209
Then, you'll see.
You'll open your eyes.

304
00:27:56,578 --> 00:27:58,412
No more sadness.

305
00:27:59,514 --> 00:28:01,015
Only joy.

306
00:28:26,207 --> 00:28:27,474
Home, sweet home.

307
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,212
It's not much but...

308
00:28:32,346 --> 00:28:35,082
they say home is
really in here and here, right?

309
00:28:35,617 --> 00:28:36,884
Yeah.

310
00:28:40,655 --> 00:28:41,989
Keeps demons away.

311
00:28:42,122 --> 00:28:43,525
You're not a demon, are ya?

312
00:28:44,158 --> 00:28:45,826
No, I can't say that I am.

313
00:28:47,061 --> 00:28:48,530
That's good for your sake.

314
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:52,366
So, what are you--
Just living out here or--

315
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:53,968
or passing through?

316
00:28:54,569 --> 00:28:56,170
I'm sorry, you're, um--

317
00:28:56,571 --> 00:28:57,838
Von.

318
00:28:58,607 --> 00:29:01,008
-My name's Von.
-I'm Will.

319
00:29:03,511 --> 00:29:06,847
I'm here on
Tuesdays and Thursdays, Will.

320
00:29:08,882 --> 00:29:09,950
Okay.

321
00:29:27,234 --> 00:29:29,370
So, what brings you out
this way tonight?

322
00:29:30,705 --> 00:29:33,173
Um, Lydia.

323
00:29:33,807 --> 00:29:35,677
Lydia, she said
that I should come here.

324
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:37,411
That I should come see you.

325
00:29:39,714 --> 00:29:40,981
Lydia.

326
00:29:42,416 --> 00:29:44,918
But your path and her
path are very different.

327
00:29:45,052 --> 00:29:46,320
I can tell.

328
00:29:47,221 --> 00:29:49,557
Though no two paths
are ever the same.

329
00:29:53,528 --> 00:29:54,696
What did Lydia tell ya?

330
00:29:55,162 --> 00:29:57,599
Just that I should come see you

331
00:29:58,265 --> 00:30:00,034
and there'll be no more sadness.

332
00:30:03,904 --> 00:30:05,439
You experienced loss.

333
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:18,252
Take this.

334
00:30:20,421 --> 00:30:23,891
Draw, sketch, paint.
Do whatever you want.

335
00:30:24,592 --> 00:30:26,260
Put it on that canvas

336
00:30:28,062 --> 00:30:29,430
and bring it back to me.

337
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,535
You want me
to just draw you a picture?

338
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,304
You can do whatever you want.

339
00:30:39,873 --> 00:30:41,609
But whatever you do,
do it for you.

340
00:30:44,211 --> 00:30:45,547
And then bring it back.

341
00:31:26,588 --> 00:31:27,856
Bullshit.

342
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,086
Yeah.

343
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:53,200
Ah!

344
00:33:57,437 --> 00:33:59,507
<i>You need to wake up, brother.</i>

345
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,628
"...but instead,
I'm here by myself.

346
00:36:00,762 --> 00:36:02,630
And so, I begin another night

347
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:06,834
and tomorrow
will be another day.

348
00:36:07,735 --> 00:36:10,170
Another day in my new reality.

349
00:36:12,974 --> 00:36:14,642
I'll never stop hurting.

350
00:36:16,443 --> 00:36:17,912
Never stop missing you.

351
00:36:20,213 --> 00:36:21,683
But I promised to

352
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:25,385
see a way forward
until we've reunited."

353
00:36:29,157 --> 00:36:30,424
Thank you, Ronnie.

354
00:36:33,061 --> 00:36:35,262
Will, let's hear yours.

355
00:36:38,331 --> 00:36:41,135
Um, no, I-- I'm not ready.

356
00:36:41,501 --> 00:36:43,938
The exercise is
not meant to be perfect.

357
00:36:44,605 --> 00:36:46,440
It's not even
meant to be finished.

358
00:36:47,407 --> 00:36:49,944
The exercise, Will, is to share.

359
00:36:50,477 --> 00:36:53,213
Come on, Will.
It's okay, give it a read.

360
00:37:01,455 --> 00:37:02,690
"My...

361
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,459
sweet Shelly. I--

362
00:37:09,664 --> 00:37:10,932
That's it.

363
00:37:11,966 --> 00:37:14,736
It's all I have right now,
I'm just, um...

364
00:37:17,038 --> 00:37:18,106
I can't find the words.

365
00:37:18,806 --> 00:37:21,475
You said her name.
That's a brave step.

366
00:37:24,344 --> 00:37:25,880
And Shelly is?

367
00:37:30,651 --> 00:37:32,419
She's my daughter.

368
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:40,128
All right, well,
that's about it for tonight,

369
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,965
um, but before we go,
I do want to address something.

370
00:37:44,866 --> 00:37:48,268
As you have probably noticed,
Lydia is not here tonight

371
00:37:48,401 --> 00:37:50,403
and moving forward,

372
00:37:50,538 --> 00:37:52,974
she will no longer
be a part of this group.

373
00:37:53,674 --> 00:37:55,375
Now, of course,
we wish her the best

374
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,044
on her healing journey,

375
00:37:57,812 --> 00:38:00,347
but I would like
to remind you all that

376
00:38:00,648 --> 00:38:03,918
when one in the group
refuses to do the tasks,

377
00:38:04,051 --> 00:38:06,486
it can damage the healing
of the whole group.

378
00:38:07,722 --> 00:38:09,422
Sometimes permanently.

379
00:38:14,294 --> 00:38:16,496
See you guys tomorrow. Oh.

380
00:38:27,374 --> 00:38:28,643
Hey, Bryan.

381
00:38:29,409 --> 00:38:32,013
Will. Good meeting tonight,
right?

382
00:38:32,647 --> 00:38:34,882
Hey, I see you doing the work

383
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,384
and I am proud of you, brother.

384
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:39,821
-Okay.
-I knew I'd get through to you.

385
00:38:39,954 --> 00:38:41,189
We're gonna have
your head thinking straight

386
00:38:41,354 --> 00:38:42,690
before you know it.

387
00:38:42,824 --> 00:38:45,026
So, I'm curious.
Why isn't Lydia coming back?

388
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:48,796
She claims she
doesn't need the group anymore.

389
00:38:49,163 --> 00:38:51,599
So, just like that, she's cured.

390
00:38:53,267 --> 00:38:56,771
She believes her daughter
has come back to her.

391
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,908
-Come back?
-Yeah.

392
00:39:01,441 --> 00:39:04,111
Her departed has come back.

393
00:39:04,846 --> 00:39:06,547
It's tragic, really.

394
00:39:07,048 --> 00:39:08,749
I mean, you've heard
her babbling on, Will.

395
00:39:08,883 --> 00:39:10,551
Obviously, it's impossible.

396
00:39:10,685 --> 00:39:13,521
What are we talking about here?
Turning back time?

397
00:39:13,654 --> 00:39:16,891
I mean, we--
we can only try to help,

398
00:39:17,024 --> 00:39:20,061
-but sometimes we--
-Fail.

399
00:39:22,997 --> 00:39:25,099
Did not fail.

400
00:39:25,233 --> 00:39:29,103
She chose not to accept help.

401
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:31,873
Yeah. Sounds tragic.

402
00:39:41,448 --> 00:39:45,119
-Will! What the fuck was that?
-Not tonight, Bryan.

403
00:39:45,253 --> 00:39:48,956
Hey. I know this is about
checking a list for you, man,

404
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:51,626
but pulling shit like that
is only going to prolong this.

405
00:39:51,759 --> 00:39:54,896
The more you resist
what is here to help you,

406
00:39:55,029 --> 00:39:57,031
the longer it's going to
take for you to see the light.

407
00:39:57,164 --> 00:39:59,233
Don't try and be
a cop with me, man.

408
00:39:59,367 --> 00:40:02,036
How dare you say that to me?
I'm here to help you.

409
00:40:02,169 --> 00:40:04,471
What's going on in there
is not helping anyone.

410
00:40:04,605 --> 00:40:06,674
It's just rehashing
the same horrible shit

411
00:40:06,807 --> 00:40:08,475
over and over again.

412
00:40:13,648 --> 00:40:14,916
That's the cycle.

413
00:40:18,686 --> 00:40:20,453
You need to wake up, brother.

414
00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:33,901
I was wondering
if you were gonna

415
00:40:34,035 --> 00:40:35,836
make your way up here tonight.

416
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,108
You know, it's funny,

417
00:40:41,242 --> 00:40:42,944
everybody can
express themselves.

418
00:40:44,278 --> 00:40:46,347
So, everyone is an artist.

419
00:40:46,981 --> 00:40:48,481
What comes out of here...

420
00:40:49,383 --> 00:40:50,685
it ends up there.

421
00:40:53,187 --> 00:40:54,522
The artist's history.

422
00:40:55,156 --> 00:40:56,456
A life lived.

423
00:40:57,058 --> 00:40:58,125
Lessons learned.

424
00:40:59,393 --> 00:41:01,696
Growth. Improvements.

425
00:41:03,631 --> 00:41:05,099
Discovery of truth.

426
00:41:17,078 --> 00:41:19,814
You know, Lydia is
making some pretty bold claims.

427
00:41:22,583 --> 00:41:27,088
And people are making some
pretty bold claims about Lydia.

428
00:41:28,622 --> 00:41:32,059
Lydia is on her own path,
and you are on yours, Will.

429
00:41:34,895 --> 00:41:36,263
This your daughter in this?

430
00:41:40,601 --> 00:41:41,936
It's okay if you don't know.

431
00:41:47,942 --> 00:41:51,846
This kind of work,
it exists in two spaces.

432
00:41:52,646 --> 00:41:53,948
A physical space

433
00:41:54,915 --> 00:41:56,684
and a psychological space.

434
00:42:04,592 --> 00:42:08,529
-You are truly a bright soul.
-Oh, I don't know about that.

435
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:14,702
I want you to look at
all those souls up there.

436
00:42:17,004 --> 00:42:18,072
Look.

437
00:42:21,609 --> 00:42:23,544
Did you know when a star dies,

438
00:42:24,311 --> 00:42:28,416
it continues to shine
its light across the universe

439
00:42:28,949 --> 00:42:31,719
for many millenniums to come?

440
00:42:33,754 --> 00:42:36,057
You just got to be
looking for that light.

441
00:42:43,664 --> 00:42:45,633
So, what are you willing to do?

442
00:42:47,701 --> 00:42:50,704
-To do for what?
-You know for what, Will.

443
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:56,610
Lydia was willing
to approach her obstacle

444
00:42:57,611 --> 00:42:58,946
with an open mind.

445
00:43:00,648 --> 00:43:02,950
And with truly open eyes.

446
00:43:03,717 --> 00:43:05,953
Now, all her sadness is gone.

447
00:43:09,023 --> 00:43:11,759
There's nothing I wouldn't do.

448
00:43:14,061 --> 00:43:17,298
-For your sadness to be gone.
-To end the cycle.

449
00:43:18,466 --> 00:43:21,335
Me and my daughter. Shelly.

450
00:43:34,415 --> 00:43:37,151
Oh, no, no. I-- I--
I couldn't take your vinyl.

451
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,322
These are meant
for someone who needs them.

452
00:43:42,123 --> 00:43:44,458
And your path has
led you to need these.

453
00:43:47,161 --> 00:43:50,097
I don't know.
What you got in there?

454
00:43:50,231 --> 00:43:52,867
I got a little of this
and a little of that.

455
00:43:54,301 --> 00:43:55,369
Listen to 'em.

456
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:58,205
See which one speaks to you.

457
00:44:01,008 --> 00:44:02,743
All right. Okay. Yeah,
I could do that.

458
00:44:02,877 --> 00:44:04,145
I-- I can do that.

459
00:44:08,048 --> 00:44:09,650
But there are rules, Will.

460
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:14,655
You must listen
with a clear and open mind.

461
00:44:17,592 --> 00:44:19,426
Free of outside influences.

462
00:44:27,569 --> 00:44:28,836
Yeah, I got it.

463
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:37,178
Sometimes, what we think is lost
is not lost at all.

464
00:44:41,115 --> 00:44:43,317
Just needs to be rediscovered.

465
00:44:48,956 --> 00:44:51,859
A clear and open mind, Will.

466
00:44:53,595 --> 00:44:54,962
That's your path forward.

467
00:47:13,334 --> 00:47:14,569
<i>Your mind is open,</i>

468
00:47:14,703 --> 00:47:16,170
<i>your heart is clear.</i>

469
00:47:16,303 --> 00:47:19,473
<i>Now, open them both</i>
<i>to what is dear.</i>

470
00:47:21,175 --> 00:47:24,244
<i>Your mind is open,</i>
<i>your heart is clear.</i>

471
00:47:24,378 --> 00:47:28,115
<i>Now, open them both</i>
<i>to what is dear.</i>

472
00:47:28,248 --> 00:47:31,118
<i>Your mind is open,</i>
<i>your heart is clear.</i>

473
00:47:31,251 --> 00:47:34,955
<i>Now, open them both</i>
<i>to what is dear.</i>

474
00:47:35,089 --> 00:47:37,958
<i>Your mind is open,</i>
<i>your heart is clear.</i>

475
00:47:38,092 --> 00:47:42,062
<i>Now, open them both</i>
<i>to what is dear.</i>

476
00:47:42,196 --> 00:47:45,199
<i>Your mind is open,</i>
<i>your heart is clear.</i>

477
00:47:45,332 --> 00:47:49,036
<i>Now, open them both</i>
<i>to what is dear.</i>

478
00:47:49,169 --> 00:47:52,039
<i>Your mind is open,</i>
<i>your heart is clear.</i>

479
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,295
<i>...to what is dear.</i>

480
00:48:15,429 --> 00:48:18,332
<i>Your mind is open,</i>
<i>your heart is clear.</i>

481
00:48:18,465 --> 00:48:22,537
<i>Now, open them both</i>
<i>to what is dear.</i>

482
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:25,439
<i>Your mind is open,</i>

483
00:48:25,573 --> 00:48:29,410
<i>Now, open them both</i>

484
00:48:29,544 --> 00:48:32,547
<i>Your mind is open,</i>

485
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:36,049
<i>Now, open them both</i>

486
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:40,320

487
00:48:40,454 --> 00:48:44,458
<i>Now, open them both</i>

488
00:48:44,592 --> 00:48:47,261
<i>Your mind is open,</i>
<i>your heart is clear.</i>

489
00:48:47,394 --> 00:48:49,329
<i>Now, open them...</i>

490
00:48:49,463 --> 00:48:52,232
<i>Your mind is open,</i>
<i>your heart is clear.</i>

491
00:48:52,366 --> 00:48:56,370
<i>Now, open them both</i>
<i>to what is dear.</i>

492
00:48:56,504 --> 00:48:59,306
<i>Your mind is open,</i>

493
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,043

<i>Now, open them both</i>

498
00:49:17,892 --> 00:49:19,960
<i>Do you want to</i>
<i>play catch, Daddy Monster?</i>

499
00:49:20,093 --> 00:49:21,428
<i>Yeah, I got one.</i>

500
00:49:21,563 --> 00:49:23,130
<i>...your heart is clear.</i>

501
00:49:23,263 --> 00:49:25,733
<i>Now, open them both</i>

502
00:49:27,468 --> 00:49:30,437

<i>Now, open them both</i>

520
00:50:39,339 --> 00:50:41,241
<i>Your mind is--</i>

521
00:51:18,412 --> 00:51:20,080
Is that you, baby girl?

522
00:51:49,611 --> 00:51:51,411
<i>Do you want to</i>
<i>play catch, Daddy Monster?</i>

523
00:51:51,546 --> 00:51:53,380
<i>Yeah, I got one.</i>

524
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,841
Come on.

525
00:52:19,974 --> 00:52:21,408
Von!

526
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:24,779
- Von!
- Hey, Will.

527
00:52:25,613 --> 00:52:27,548
Where did you get
those records from?

528
00:52:29,951 --> 00:52:33,253
-You played one of mine?
-Yes, I played yours.

529
00:52:34,555 --> 00:52:36,156
With a clear mind?

530
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:38,425
That was your voice.

531
00:52:39,093 --> 00:52:40,828
Are you doing this?

532
00:52:44,699 --> 00:52:48,002
There's this--
there's this red ball

533
00:52:48,136 --> 00:52:49,671
that my daughter
used to play with.

534
00:52:50,237 --> 00:52:53,206
And-- and Von,
that ball came rolling

535
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:54,441
right up to me.

536
00:52:54,575 --> 00:52:55,810
It was as if Shelly,

537
00:52:55,943 --> 00:52:57,277
she just rolled it
to me herself.

538
00:52:57,679 --> 00:52:59,479
And then
I played the record again,

539
00:52:59,614 --> 00:53:02,016
-nothing happened.
-Yeah, that can happen.

540
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:03,417
That can happen--

541
00:53:03,551 --> 00:53:06,253
Come on.
You gotta work with me, man.

542
00:53:06,988 --> 00:53:08,823
You got-- you gotta
give me something here,

543
00:53:08,956 --> 00:53:12,060
cause I need to know
that I'm not going crazy.

544
00:53:12,192 --> 00:53:14,494
You're on the path now, Will.

545
00:53:19,867 --> 00:53:21,234
You're on the path.

546
00:53:31,979 --> 00:53:33,246
There was a time,

547
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,683
when I was experimenting
with recording.

548
00:53:36,918 --> 00:53:39,554
At first,
it was just music, noise.

549
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:44,892
And then I started
to introduce the spoken word

550
00:53:45,026 --> 00:53:46,861
and as time passed by...

551
00:53:49,664 --> 00:53:51,866
strange things
started to happen.

552
00:53:55,136 --> 00:53:57,270
The recordings actually...

553
00:53:59,107 --> 00:54:00,875
started doing things.

554
00:54:01,441 --> 00:54:04,377
Good things, Will, good things.

555
00:54:05,146 --> 00:54:07,247
To people that had open minds.

556
00:54:10,752 --> 00:54:12,787
But then you got to be
careful what you wish for.

557
00:54:13,988 --> 00:54:15,322
Because...

558
00:54:16,758 --> 00:54:17,825
well...

559
00:54:19,093 --> 00:54:20,828
folks don't always like

560
00:54:21,529 --> 00:54:23,731
what they discover
about themselves.

561
00:54:29,604 --> 00:54:31,572
That's the next one, Will.

562
00:54:36,476 --> 00:54:38,613
So, there are some after this?

563
00:54:40,313 --> 00:54:41,949
That is the next one.

564
00:54:53,795 --> 00:54:54,862
Von.

565
00:54:58,099 --> 00:54:59,366
Von!

566
00:55:17,819 --> 00:55:19,187
<i>Your mind is open,</i>

567
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:20,855
<i>your heart is clear.</i>

568
00:55:20,988 --> 00:55:24,859
<i>Now, open them both</i>
<i>to what is dear.</i>

569
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:28,095
<i>The burden you carry</i>
<i>is heavy and fierce.</i>

570
00:55:28,229 --> 00:55:32,567
<i>Vanquish it now or your heart,</i>
<i>it will pierce.</i>

571
00:55:33,868 --> 00:55:36,838
<i>Your mind is open,</i>
<i>your heart is clear.</i>

572
00:55:36,971 --> 00:55:40,808
<i>Now, open them both</i>
<i>to what is dear.</i>

573
00:55:40,942 --> 00:55:44,111
<i>The burden you carry</i>
<i>is heavy and fierce.</i>

574
00:55:44,245 --> 00:55:47,982
<i>Vanquish it now, or your heart,</i>
<i>it will pierce.</i>

575
00:55:49,917 --> 00:55:52,820
<i>Your mind is open,</i>
<i>your heart is clear.</i>

576
00:55:52,954 --> 00:55:56,224
<i>Now, open them both</i>
<i>to what is dear.</i>

577
00:55:56,356 --> 00:55:59,660
<i>The burden you carry</i>
<i>is heavy and fierce.</i>

578
00:55:59,794 --> 00:56:03,898
<i>Vanquish it now or your heart,</i>
<i>it will pierce.</i>

579
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:14,041
I'm right here, Goblin.

580
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:20,681
<i>Daddy, look at</i>
<i>the wind chime I made.</i>

581
00:56:20,815 --> 00:56:23,251
<i>You made that,</i>
<i>Goblin? It's beautiful.</i>

582
00:56:49,543 --> 00:56:50,811
Fuck.

583
00:56:51,379 --> 00:56:52,647
Von!

584
00:56:55,216 --> 00:56:56,284
Hey, Von. Hello.

585
00:56:56,717 --> 00:56:58,953
You're on the path now, Will.

586
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:01,454
Lydia, where did you come from?

587
00:57:01,589 --> 00:57:04,225
-Where's Von?
-Don't leave your path.

588
00:57:05,293 --> 00:57:09,030
Keep your goal in sight
and don't let them stop you.

589
00:57:10,131 --> 00:57:11,198
I did.

590
00:57:12,266 --> 00:57:14,101
I'm so happy now.

591
00:57:15,403 --> 00:57:17,071
Lydia, I'm so--

592
00:57:17,538 --> 00:57:19,106
I'm so confused,
and I don't know

593
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,142
- what to do here, I--
- You know what to do.

594
00:58:05,953 --> 00:58:07,188
<i>Your mind is open,</i>

595
00:58:07,321 --> 00:58:08,789
<i>your heart is clear.</i>

596
00:58:08,923 --> 00:58:12,793
<i>Now, open them both</i>
<i>to what is dear.</i>

597
00:58:12,927 --> 00:58:16,030
<i>The burden you carry</i>
<i>is heavy and fierce.</i>

598
00:58:16,163 --> 00:58:20,968
<i>Vanquish it now or your heart,</i>
<i>it will pierce.</i>

599
00:58:21,102 --> 00:58:23,771
<i>Embrace the pain</i>
<i>that dwells within</i>

600
00:58:23,904 --> 00:58:28,242
<i>for healing can start</i>
<i>once you let it in.</i>

601
00:58:28,376 --> 00:58:31,746
<i>Your mind is open,</i>
<i>your heart is clear.</i>

602
00:58:31,879 --> 00:58:35,282
<i>Now, open them both</i>
<i>to what is dear.</i>

603
00:58:35,416 --> 00:58:38,853
<i>The burden you carry</i>
<i>is heavy and fierce.</i>

604
00:58:38,986 --> 00:58:43,758
<i>Vanquish it now or your heart,</i>
<i>it will pierce.</i>

605
00:58:43,891 --> 00:58:46,360
<i>Embrace the pain</i>
<i>that dwells within</i>

606
00:58:46,494 --> 00:58:49,930
<i>for healing can start</i>
<i>once you let it in.</i>

607
00:58:51,866 --> 00:58:54,168
<i>Your mind is open,</i>
<i>your heart is clear.</i>

608
00:58:54,301 --> 00:58:58,239
<i>Now, open them both</i>
<i>to what is dear.</i>

609
00:58:58,372 --> 00:59:01,776
<i>The burden you carry</i>
<i>is heavy and fierce.</i>

610
00:59:01,909 --> 00:59:04,912
<i>Vanquish it now or your heart,</i>
<i>it will--</i>

611
00:59:43,951 --> 00:59:46,987
There's one mystery solved.
You're alive.

612
00:59:48,622 --> 00:59:49,924
You okay?

613
00:59:50,724 --> 00:59:52,093
What's the matter, Will?

614
00:59:52,726 --> 00:59:54,161
You look like
you've seen a goblin.

615
00:59:58,332 --> 00:59:59,633
How'd you find me?

616
01:00:01,202 --> 01:00:02,269
We know things.

617
01:00:04,438 --> 01:00:05,706
Mind if I come in?

618
01:00:27,562 --> 01:00:29,797
Nice place, Will.

619
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:31,332
This room could
use a little light.

620
01:00:32,601 --> 01:00:33,868
But nice.

621
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:37,471
You mind telling me
what you're doing here?

622
01:00:38,607 --> 01:00:41,142
I was on my way out the door,
headin' home.

623
01:00:42,743 --> 01:00:44,245
Dispatch gets a call.

624
01:00:45,446 --> 01:00:46,714
Welfare check.

625
01:00:48,215 --> 01:00:50,284
Normally I'd say, "Fuck it.

626
01:00:51,218 --> 01:00:53,320
I got pot roast
waiting for me at home."

627
01:00:55,756 --> 01:00:57,791
In dispatch,
they get the address,

628
01:00:58,425 --> 01:00:59,693
name of the owner.

629
01:01:01,795 --> 01:01:03,097
You.

630
01:01:03,864 --> 01:01:05,132
So, I say, "Fuck it.

631
01:01:06,033 --> 01:01:07,701
That pot roast can wait."

632
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:33,694
Was it worth it, brother?

633
01:01:34,395 --> 01:01:36,330
I haven't had a drink
since last night.

634
01:01:36,797 --> 01:01:39,300
-I swear, on my daughter.
-Don't.

635
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:41,135
Do not.

636
01:01:41,802 --> 01:01:43,304
Never swear on that.

637
01:01:46,407 --> 01:01:49,476
All you had to do
was reach out to me, man.

638
01:01:50,177 --> 01:01:53,147
I was ready, willing and able.

639
01:01:54,348 --> 01:01:56,483
But then you had to have
yourself a three-day bender.

640
01:01:56,618 --> 01:01:58,986
I told you I haven't
had a drink in 24 hours.

641
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:00,655
Oh, Will, just stop.

642
01:02:00,788 --> 01:02:02,289
Stop it, okay?

643
01:02:04,124 --> 01:02:06,393
Look, I get what
you're going through, man.

644
01:02:06,528 --> 01:02:07,761
I get it.

645
01:02:07,895 --> 01:02:09,296
But there's what
you're going through

646
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:11,966
and there's what
you're required to go through.

647
01:02:12,766 --> 01:02:15,302
Bender? Three days?
What are you talking about?

648
01:02:15,436 --> 01:02:17,104
Okay, okay.

649
01:02:18,806 --> 01:02:20,474
You skip three nights of group,

650
01:02:20,609 --> 01:02:22,243
refuse to answer your calls,

651
01:02:22,876 --> 01:02:24,812
then you get
a welfare check called in.

652
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:27,748
You know how
this thing works, Will.

653
01:02:27,881 --> 01:02:29,016
Too many strikes.

654
01:02:29,149 --> 01:02:30,985
-Fuck you, man.
-Oh, fuck me?

655
01:02:31,118 --> 01:02:32,520
-Yeah, fuck you.
-Okay.

656
01:02:32,654 --> 01:02:33,988
You know I was there earlier.

657
01:02:34,121 --> 01:02:35,724
You're just trying
to mess with me now,

658
01:02:35,856 --> 01:02:37,458
like some kind
of healing strategy.

659
01:02:37,592 --> 01:02:39,927
Oh, yeah,
I saw you three nights ago

660
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:41,529
and you were pretty charged up.

661
01:02:51,305 --> 01:02:53,474
Man, I should have
come up here a long time ago.

662
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:58,345
You know, Bella's really
torn up about this.

663
01:02:59,046 --> 01:03:01,516
Losing you from group
so soon after Lydia?

664
01:03:02,617 --> 01:03:04,051
She's really beating herself up.

665
01:03:17,565 --> 01:03:18,767
Yes, I know.

666
01:03:19,266 --> 01:03:21,001
No, but he will soon.

667
01:03:21,935 --> 01:03:23,705
We have to stay united
on this, okay?

668
01:03:23,837 --> 01:03:25,105
It's the only way.

669
01:03:26,073 --> 01:03:27,408
What do we always say?

670
01:03:27,908 --> 01:03:30,010
"This too shall pass."

671
01:03:30,377 --> 01:03:32,479
In the end,
I promise you, you will see,

672
01:03:32,614 --> 01:03:36,350
this was the best for everyone,
the best for you, the best for--

673
01:03:39,186 --> 01:03:40,888
Hey, listen, I gotta go, okay?

674
01:03:41,656 --> 01:03:42,923
Yeah.

675
01:03:45,993 --> 01:03:47,261
How you feeling?

676
01:03:47,961 --> 01:03:49,229
What was that?

677
01:03:49,698 --> 01:03:50,964
That was a work thing.

678
01:03:57,806 --> 01:03:59,073
So...

679
01:03:59,641 --> 01:04:00,908
to recap.

680
01:04:02,777 --> 01:04:03,944
You left the meeting?

681
01:04:04,078 --> 01:04:05,580
About an hour ago.

682
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,048
You say an hour,
I say three days.

683
01:04:09,283 --> 01:04:10,652
You left the meeting.

684
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:14,723
Then you went to visit
this homeless man

685
01:04:15,189 --> 01:04:16,156
who lives in the woods?

686
01:04:16,290 --> 01:04:17,592
A man you've been...

687
01:04:18,727 --> 01:04:20,961
visiting and speaking with.

688
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:24,632
So, this fellow, he...

689
01:04:25,332 --> 01:04:28,268
He gives you records,
and these records, they--

690
01:04:28,402 --> 01:04:31,639
-Only some of them.
-Some of these records...

691
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:34,942
have brought back...

692
01:04:35,376 --> 01:04:37,945
...items that
were in photographs

693
01:04:38,078 --> 01:04:39,647
with your little girl, right?

694
01:04:41,415 --> 01:04:42,483
Okay.

695
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:44,885
Let me tell you what I see.

696
01:04:46,453 --> 01:04:49,657
I see a man who has
refused help over and over.

697
01:04:49,791 --> 01:04:51,291
I see a man who insists on

698
01:04:51,425 --> 01:04:53,961
drinking himself into a coma
every single night,

699
01:04:54,094 --> 01:04:55,996
refusing to face
his new reality.

700
01:04:56,564 --> 01:05:01,068
You hit the sauce extra hard,
blackout, lose track of time,

701
01:05:01,201 --> 01:05:03,437
start going through
your daughter's old stuff.

702
01:05:04,672 --> 01:05:07,975
Start drinking again,
repeat the process and, brother,

703
01:05:08,475 --> 01:05:09,544
Three days...

704
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:11,378
gone.

705
01:05:12,045 --> 01:05:14,081
After we lost our Shelly...

706
01:05:18,952 --> 01:05:21,288
her mother took all her stuff.

707
01:05:21,823 --> 01:05:23,223
Including these.

708
01:05:27,695 --> 01:05:30,230
So, it would be impossible

709
01:05:31,198 --> 01:05:33,701
for me to pull out these things.

710
01:05:34,134 --> 01:05:35,402
Look.

711
01:05:35,804 --> 01:05:37,539
I'm not saying this is the case,

712
01:05:38,005 --> 01:05:40,775
but is there any reason
your ex would be

713
01:05:40,909 --> 01:05:42,176
maybe coming in here?

714
01:05:43,143 --> 01:05:46,413
Poking around, moving things,

715
01:05:46,548 --> 01:05:47,615
trying to...

716
01:05:48,949 --> 01:05:51,318
bait you into some sort of a--

717
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:53,987
-Will?
-Yeah.

718
01:05:56,758 --> 01:05:58,025
Is this you?

719
01:05:59,694 --> 01:06:00,728
Me?

720
01:06:00,862 --> 01:06:02,564
Will, I-- I don't-- I don't know

721
01:06:02,697 --> 01:06:04,933
-what you're talking about.
-Who put you up to this?

722
01:06:05,633 --> 01:06:08,670
- Me?
- Who put you up to this?

723
01:06:11,405 --> 01:06:13,073
I can assure you I have no idea

724
01:06:13,207 --> 01:06:14,676
who or what
you're talking about here.

725
01:06:14,809 --> 01:06:16,544
How does she get to you?

726
01:06:17,579 --> 01:06:19,514
-Are you fucking--
-Hey, hey, brother.

727
01:06:19,647 --> 01:06:22,382
Let's take a breath here,
you and me, okay?

728
01:06:22,517 --> 01:06:23,618
Take a seat

729
01:06:24,084 --> 01:06:25,787
and let's count to ten, okay?

730
01:06:26,554 --> 01:06:28,388
Tell me what
you're thinking here.

731
01:06:28,890 --> 01:06:30,123
Will.

732
01:06:31,893 --> 01:06:33,160
Will!

733
01:06:34,629 --> 01:06:35,730
Shit.

734
01:07:32,587 --> 01:07:35,623
Daddy Monster? Hi, Daddy.

735
01:07:35,757 --> 01:07:37,090
Hi, Goblin.

736
01:07:42,229 --> 01:07:44,064
Daddy Monster,
I've been practicing

737
01:07:44,197 --> 01:07:45,667
holding my breath.

738
01:07:47,835 --> 01:07:50,437
Can you get me the bubble
blower under the sink?

739
01:07:53,741 --> 01:07:54,742
Sure.

740
01:08:20,835 --> 01:08:22,570
Ah!

741
01:08:48,228 --> 01:08:49,530
Easy, Will.

742
01:08:53,433 --> 01:08:54,836
Is that thing loaded?

743
01:08:57,005 --> 01:08:58,271
She--

744
01:08:59,641 --> 01:09:00,708
She--

745
01:09:01,475 --> 01:09:03,443
-she was here.
-Who was, Will?

746
01:09:04,277 --> 01:09:05,613
Shelly.

747
01:09:06,179 --> 01:09:07,414
She was here.

748
01:09:07,982 --> 01:09:09,851
She was getting ready
for her bath.

749
01:09:09,984 --> 01:09:12,620
These are her things. It worked.

750
01:09:14,454 --> 01:09:16,189
How about you and I take a walk.

751
01:09:17,892 --> 01:09:19,127
Von!

752
01:09:20,128 --> 01:09:21,729
Von!

753
01:09:21,863 --> 01:09:22,897
Uh, wait.

754
01:09:23,031 --> 01:09:24,364
Who's-- Lydia.

755
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:27,434
Okay.

756
01:09:28,136 --> 01:09:29,537
All right.

757
01:09:31,371 --> 01:09:32,507
Lydia was right here.

758
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:36,243
She told me that
I needed to stay on my path,

759
01:09:36,376 --> 01:09:38,646
and that--
that she was happy now.

760
01:09:39,379 --> 01:09:41,214
Well, that's impossible.

761
01:09:41,716 --> 01:09:42,784
What is?

762
01:09:44,284 --> 01:09:45,820
Will, Lydia is dead.

763
01:09:47,454 --> 01:09:49,624
She killed herself
two nights ago.

764
01:09:51,893 --> 01:09:54,562
No. No.

765
01:10:03,771 --> 01:10:06,074
Where is he?
I know he's here somewhere.

766
01:10:06,206 --> 01:10:08,509
Von is here. He's here.

767
01:10:09,409 --> 01:10:11,311
Oh, God.

768
01:10:11,713 --> 01:10:13,748
"The victim,
Shelly Foster, age nine,

769
01:10:13,881 --> 01:10:15,883
was taken from the home
to Hope Memorial Hospital,

770
01:10:16,017 --> 01:10:18,119
where she was
later pronounced dead.

771
01:10:18,251 --> 01:10:20,955
-Cause of death was ruled..."
-Accidental drowning.

772
01:10:22,056 --> 01:10:25,560
-Where did you get that?
-Inside, in a box.

773
01:10:25,693 --> 01:10:28,462
"The distraught mother
claims that she had arrived

774
01:10:28,596 --> 01:10:30,430
at the house with
her friend to discuss

775
01:10:30,565 --> 01:10:32,800
custody issues
with her estranged husband,

776
01:10:33,568 --> 01:10:34,802
Will Foster."

777
01:10:39,173 --> 01:10:40,508
Who is this man, Will?

778
01:10:41,976 --> 01:10:43,911
And why would he have
these clippings about you?

779
01:10:44,912 --> 01:10:46,279
About your daughter.

780
01:10:47,715 --> 01:10:51,953
It's-- it's Lydia.
Lydia, she gave a map.

781
01:10:55,056 --> 01:10:56,924
"Your mind is open...

782
01:10:58,258 --> 01:10:59,727
your heart is clear.

783
01:11:01,361 --> 01:11:03,497
Now, open them both
to what is dear."

784
01:11:04,866 --> 01:11:07,034
And that's what he'd say
on the records?

785
01:11:07,168 --> 01:11:08,236
Yeah.

786
01:11:08,936 --> 01:11:12,006
And then after a while,
he would say to...

787
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:15,042
"Embrace the pain
that dwells within.

788
01:11:15,777 --> 01:11:18,780
The healing starts
once you let it in."

789
01:11:19,312 --> 01:11:20,715
And there was another two.

790
01:11:21,149 --> 01:11:22,315
Those were different.

791
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:24,652
"The burden that you carry,

792
01:11:25,219 --> 01:11:27,622
it's heavy and fierce.

793
01:11:28,022 --> 01:11:29,557
Vanquish it now

794
01:11:30,423 --> 01:11:32,059
or your heart, it will pierce."

795
01:11:32,193 --> 01:11:37,198
And then this last one, "The
ending must occur to begin anew,

796
01:11:37,598 --> 01:11:39,934
but only in the pure

797
01:11:41,068 --> 01:11:42,502
can this be true."

798
01:11:45,206 --> 01:11:46,741
And you memorized that?

799
01:11:47,108 --> 01:11:48,441
All the repetition.

800
01:11:49,442 --> 01:11:50,878
And now there's nothing on here?

801
01:11:51,344 --> 01:11:53,514
When you play it
back again, nothing.

802
01:11:57,151 --> 01:11:58,719
Bible verses.

803
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:01,756
-What?
-These are Bible verses.

804
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:04,759
Not written in
the correct catalog format,

805
01:12:04,892 --> 01:12:06,828
but they're-- they're scripture.

806
01:12:08,763 --> 01:12:11,666
-Which one was first?
-Matthew.

807
01:12:13,366 --> 01:12:15,803
Matthew 7:7.

808
01:12:16,503 --> 01:12:18,706
"Ask, and it shall
be given unto you.

809
01:12:19,472 --> 01:12:20,473
Seek and you shall find."

810
01:12:20,608 --> 01:12:22,810
John 9:25 next, right?

811
01:12:24,245 --> 01:12:25,880
"Whereas once I was blind,

812
01:12:26,581 --> 01:12:27,849
now I can see."

813
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:30,818
And the latest one?

814
01:12:31,384 --> 01:12:33,521
It's a...

815
01:12:35,823 --> 01:12:37,525
It's a story about Lazarus.

816
01:12:38,926 --> 01:12:40,795
A man who was
raised from the dead.

817
01:12:42,296 --> 01:12:44,031
And you memorized all this, huh?

818
01:12:44,397 --> 01:12:46,601
Repetition.

819
01:12:48,002 --> 01:12:49,070
Sunday school.

820
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:50,938
Lots of it.

821
01:12:51,505 --> 01:12:52,740
So, it works.

822
01:12:53,473 --> 01:12:55,109
It works, it's working.

823
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:56,978
Shelly....

824
01:12:57,645 --> 01:12:58,946
she's not gone.

825
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:01,182
She's just stuck.

826
01:13:01,816 --> 01:13:04,417
She's gonna come back,
'cause I'm gonna bring her back.

827
01:13:04,552 --> 01:13:05,953
It's just like Lydia said--

828
01:13:06,087 --> 01:13:09,824
Will, L-- Lydia let
her grief consume her.

829
01:13:09,957 --> 01:13:13,828
Okay? She went chasing a ghost
and it took her life, too.

830
01:13:14,262 --> 01:13:15,830
She was getting better.

831
01:13:16,864 --> 01:13:18,032
Happier.

832
01:13:18,165 --> 01:13:19,767
No, delusion could
seem like that, Will.

833
01:13:20,902 --> 01:13:22,770
And what we're
talking about here it-- it...

834
01:13:24,437 --> 01:13:26,007
It's supposed to be impossible.

835
01:13:26,607 --> 01:13:28,175
Yeah, but I saw her.

836
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:31,545
And I know you saw it.

837
01:13:32,113 --> 01:13:34,615
You saw that it works.

838
01:13:36,449 --> 01:13:39,486
I can see what's
going on here, okay?

839
01:13:40,655 --> 01:13:43,157
And I can help you.
I will help you.

840
01:13:44,258 --> 01:13:45,326
But, Will...

841
01:13:45,927 --> 01:13:48,095
you cannot let
this take over you,

842
01:13:48,229 --> 01:13:49,363
like it took over Lydia.

843
01:13:49,496 --> 01:13:51,165
You have to be strong, Will.

844
01:13:52,366 --> 01:13:54,467
I have to get my girl back.

845
01:13:56,737 --> 01:13:58,906
I have to get the next one.

846
01:14:00,241 --> 01:14:03,010
That could be the one
that brings her back.

847
01:14:07,315 --> 01:14:09,083
Okay, here's what I'm gonna do.

848
01:14:10,217 --> 01:14:12,787
You're gonna go back
to group tomorrow night.

849
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:14,956
Listen, we're gonna talk
to Bella.

850
01:14:15,089 --> 01:14:16,991
We are going
to do everything we can

851
01:14:17,124 --> 01:14:18,793
to help you
with the judge, okay?

852
01:14:20,227 --> 01:14:21,862
Okay?

853
01:14:22,997 --> 01:14:24,398
- But--
- No, hey, hey!

854
01:14:24,532 --> 01:14:25,700
You're gonna do this for me.

855
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:28,169
But more importantly,
for yourself.

856
01:14:29,136 --> 01:14:31,138
And no more booze, okay?

857
01:14:31,272 --> 01:14:33,808
Get yourself to group
tomorrow night.

858
01:14:33,941 --> 01:14:37,311
And then we will go from there
to fix all of this.

859
01:14:38,045 --> 01:14:40,648
And I'll find
this man for you. Von.

860
01:14:42,249 --> 01:14:43,517
How?

861
01:14:44,385 --> 01:14:45,920
How-- how you can find him?

862
01:14:48,689 --> 01:14:50,057
I got resources.

863
01:14:51,926 --> 01:14:53,561
We'll get this resolved.

864
01:14:54,161 --> 01:14:55,229
I promise.

865
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:00,201
Thank you.

866
01:15:05,172 --> 01:15:06,640
So, tomorrow.

867
01:15:08,642 --> 01:15:10,644
-No alcohol
-And?

868
01:15:11,145 --> 01:15:13,080
I'll be there.
I'll be at the meeting.

869
01:15:13,214 --> 01:15:14,281
Okay.

870
01:15:15,016 --> 01:15:16,083
Huh.

871
01:15:16,884 --> 01:15:18,919
You know, I think
I left my cell phone in there.

872
01:15:19,053 --> 01:15:20,521
I'll grab it, I'll grab it.

873
01:15:45,346 --> 01:15:46,614
All right.

874
01:15:47,448 --> 01:15:48,716
See you tomorrow.

875
01:17:42,531 --> 01:17:44,698
-Which one of you did it?
-Bryan, he has a gun!

876
01:17:44,832 --> 01:17:46,433
Hm? Which one of you?

877
01:17:46,568 --> 01:17:49,003
Which one of you called in
the bullshit welfare check?

878
01:17:49,136 --> 01:17:50,572
Hm?

879
01:17:50,704 --> 01:17:53,073
Which one of you is watching me?

880
01:17:53,974 --> 01:17:55,577
You, motherfucker? You, Stan?

881
01:17:55,709 --> 01:17:57,244
Okay, Will, listen to me.

882
01:17:57,745 --> 01:17:59,113
You and I just need to talk.

883
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:01,348
What have you been up to?

884
01:18:02,383 --> 01:18:03,417
Hm?

885
01:18:03,552 --> 01:18:04,718
You little fucking snake.

886
01:18:04,852 --> 01:18:06,253
What have you been up to?

887
01:18:06,387 --> 01:18:08,856
-Where is he?
-Will, let's just calm down.

888
01:18:08,989 --> 01:18:10,024
I'm sure we could
work something out--

889
01:18:10,157 --> 01:18:11,759
No, you shut the fuck up!

890
01:18:11,892 --> 01:18:13,260
You shut the fuck up,

891
01:18:13,394 --> 01:18:16,096
'cause for all I know,
you killed Lydia.

892
01:18:18,533 --> 01:18:20,301
You want to keep her quiet.

893
01:18:21,302 --> 01:18:23,204
You don't want
to hear the truth.

894
01:18:24,738 --> 01:18:27,007
Okay, everybody, relax.

895
01:18:27,908 --> 01:18:29,176
I know Will,

896
01:18:29,310 --> 01:18:31,078
and Will is
a very reasonable man.

897
01:18:31,212 --> 01:18:34,782
Bryan, you don't know shit.

898
01:18:35,382 --> 01:18:36,951
And I've had about enough
of that fucking,

899
01:18:37,084 --> 01:18:38,953
"I'm here
to help you," bullshit!

900
01:18:39,086 --> 01:18:40,354
Von is in custody.

901
01:18:41,789 --> 01:18:43,592
Okay? I had to do it, Will.

902
01:18:43,724 --> 01:18:45,459
I had to call it in.
It's my job.

903
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:48,128
A man was squatting
on public property.

904
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:51,165
I see you're trying
to keep Shelly away from me.

905
01:18:52,132 --> 01:18:55,436
She's not gone, Bryan.
She's stuck.

906
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:57,471
She's stuck,

907
01:18:57,606 --> 01:19:00,107
and Von is the only one
that can bring her home.

908
01:19:00,774 --> 01:19:03,744
But you don't want me to
get my Shelly back, do you?

909
01:19:04,378 --> 01:19:06,313
Hm? It's been you.

910
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,983
It's been fucking you
all along, Bryan!

911
01:19:09,116 --> 01:19:10,417
I can get what you want.

912
01:19:12,353 --> 01:19:14,054
I was there when
they brought him in, okay?

913
01:19:14,188 --> 01:19:16,190
They brought in
all his possessions.

914
01:19:16,558 --> 01:19:17,891
I processed it.

915
01:19:18,492 --> 01:19:19,527
Guess what?

916
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:21,428
There's another record.

917
01:19:22,796 --> 01:19:24,064
It's the one you want.

918
01:19:28,570 --> 01:19:29,837
It's the one you want.

919
01:19:34,275 --> 01:19:36,477
- You're lying.
- Mm-mmm.

920
01:19:37,512 --> 01:19:38,879
It's the last record.

921
01:19:39,847 --> 01:19:41,315
It might be the one to do it.

922
01:19:41,683 --> 01:19:43,150
To bring your daughter back.

923
01:19:43,851 --> 01:19:45,119
Shelly.

924
01:19:46,387 --> 01:19:49,156
-Where is it?
-It's at the station.

925
01:19:50,157 --> 01:19:52,126
So, let's you and I,
we'll go get it.

926
01:19:52,761 --> 01:19:54,428
Leave everyone else out of this.

927
01:19:55,863 --> 01:19:57,197
What do you say?

928
01:19:58,465 --> 01:19:59,833
I say yeah.

929
01:19:59,967 --> 01:20:01,670
- Okay.
- Let's go to the station.

930
01:20:02,269 --> 01:20:04,539
But you're bringing
this fucking bitch too.

931
01:20:05,105 --> 01:20:06,675
Okay. No, Bryan, it's okay.

932
01:20:06,807 --> 01:20:08,108
-It's okay.
-Let's go.

933
01:20:09,843 --> 01:20:11,445
It's okay. It's okay.

934
01:20:16,685 --> 01:20:17,851
Oh, Jesus.

935
01:20:48,982 --> 01:20:51,885
He's usually talking by now.
He's usually talking by now.

936
01:20:53,387 --> 01:20:55,189
-Man, if we just--
-No, shut up!

937
01:20:55,322 --> 01:20:58,325
Come on.

938
01:21:13,407 --> 01:21:14,475
Shelly.

939
01:21:28,790 --> 01:21:30,357
You need to wake up, brother.

940
01:21:30,991 --> 01:21:32,493
Will, where's Shelly?

941
01:21:34,228 --> 01:21:35,663
What did you say?

942
01:21:35,797 --> 01:21:37,565
Now, Bryan!

943
01:21:45,406 --> 01:21:47,642
<i>Your mind is open,</i>
<i>your heart is clear.</i>

944
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:50,845
<i>Now, open them both</i>
<i>to what is dear.</i>

945
01:21:59,286 --> 01:22:00,988
<i>This your daughter in this?</i>

946
01:22:11,298 --> 01:22:12,700
- Jesus!
- Hey!

947
01:22:12,834 --> 01:22:14,234
You're not going to
be needing that, Will.

948
01:22:14,368 --> 01:22:16,336
-Oh, this?
-Easy, brother.

949
01:22:16,470 --> 01:22:19,072
Will, just give me Shelly
and we'll be out of here.

950
01:22:21,876 --> 01:22:24,478
I think
she's staying with me tonight.

951
01:22:24,612 --> 01:22:27,181
You know that's
not the arrangement.

952
01:22:27,582 --> 01:22:28,650
The arrangement?

953
01:22:29,082 --> 01:22:30,685
The arrangement,
like the one we had,

954
01:22:30,819 --> 01:22:32,119
not to fuck other people?

955
01:22:32,252 --> 01:22:33,688
Like that one
you're talking about?

956
01:22:33,822 --> 01:22:35,222
Hey, come on, come on,
this is not you, man.

957
01:22:35,355 --> 01:22:36,957
You don't know me, man.

958
01:22:37,090 --> 01:22:38,225
You don't know
any fucking thing about me.

959
01:22:38,358 --> 01:22:40,027
Will, this is insane.

960
01:22:40,728 --> 01:22:43,096
You're pointing
a gun at me, at Bella.

961
01:22:44,131 --> 01:22:45,399
What would Shelly think

962
01:22:45,533 --> 01:22:46,967
if she saw what
you're doing right now?

963
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:49,069
Don't. Don't you say her name.

964
01:22:49,704 --> 01:22:51,405
Whatever you think
about Bella and I,

965
01:22:51,539 --> 01:22:53,575
this is not how
you want this to go down.

966
01:22:53,708 --> 01:22:55,275
Will, where is Shelly?

967
01:22:58,713 --> 01:23:00,682
Shelly, no.

968
01:23:00,815 --> 01:23:02,149
Ah!

969
01:23:04,552 --> 01:23:06,788
<i>The burden you carry</i>
<i>is heavy and fierce.</i>

970
01:23:06,921 --> 01:23:11,391
<i>Vanquish it now or your heart,</i>
<i>it will pierce.</i>

971
01:23:12,326 --> 01:23:14,596
Will.

972
01:23:14,729 --> 01:23:17,364
Brother, you're stuck
in a shit cycle right now,

973
01:23:17,498 --> 01:23:20,000
going round and round and round.

974
01:23:20,133 --> 01:23:21,301
You need someone
to help pull you back

975
01:23:21,435 --> 01:23:23,070
on the healthier path.

976
01:23:23,470 --> 01:23:25,974
And that someone
can be a new friend.

977
01:23:26,908 --> 01:23:29,711
Yeah, maybe someone
in this very group.

978
01:23:31,478 --> 01:23:33,915
<i>Embrace the pain</i>
<i>that dwells within,</i>

979
01:23:34,047 --> 01:23:38,118

<i>Lydia, no,</i>

989
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:01,108
Can I have a cigarette?

990
01:24:01,241 --> 01:24:02,510
No.

991
01:24:02,644 --> 01:24:04,612
Please, can I talk to Dr. Von?

992
01:24:04,746 --> 01:24:05,914
Can I talk to Dr. Von?

993
01:24:06,046 --> 01:24:09,249
- Please.
- Not now.

994
01:24:09,383 --> 01:24:11,385
<i>Dr. Von helps us feel better.</i>

995
01:24:11,519 --> 01:24:13,521
They don't want us
to get better.

996
01:24:15,790 --> 01:24:18,292
Almost like they
don't want us to get better.

997
01:24:20,695 --> 01:24:22,329
-Come on.
-One day at a time.

998
01:24:22,462 --> 01:24:25,432
That's right, my dear.
That's right. Come on.

999
01:24:25,567 --> 01:24:27,802
One day at a time.

1000
01:24:31,039 --> 01:24:34,174
<i>Lydia's on her own path,</i>
<i>and you are on yours, Will.</i>

1001
01:24:34,308 --> 01:24:35,777
That's it.

1002
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:38,813
Bon appétit.

1003
01:24:39,179 --> 01:24:40,582
This kind of work,

1004
01:24:41,248 --> 01:24:42,850
it exists in two spaces.

1005
01:24:43,818 --> 01:24:45,285
<i>The physical space</i>

1006
01:24:46,988 --> 01:24:48,756
<i>and the psychological space.</i>

1007
01:24:49,724 --> 01:24:51,124
<i>Beautiful, Will.</i>

1008
01:24:52,125 --> 01:24:53,828
<i>That's beautiful.</i>

1009
01:24:53,962 --> 01:24:55,897
<i>You know what I see?</i>

1010
01:24:56,030 --> 01:25:00,200
<i>I see a dad leading</i>

1013
01:25:09,978 --> 01:25:12,112
It's a beautiful night,
huh, Will?

1014
01:25:14,682 --> 01:25:15,717
You know,

1015
01:25:16,517 --> 01:25:20,187
when a star dies,
it continues to shine its light

1016
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:21,723
across the universe

1017
01:25:22,189 --> 01:25:24,759
for many millenniums to come.

1018
01:25:27,695 --> 01:25:29,229
You just gotta be
looking for that light.

1019
01:25:35,469 --> 01:25:37,572
You're on the path now, Will.

1020
01:25:40,942 --> 01:25:42,309
Well done.

1021
01:25:44,112 --> 01:25:48,650
An open mind and a clear heart
is a wonderful path for you.

1022
01:25:50,985 --> 01:25:52,452
You're a bright soul.

1023
01:25:54,656 --> 01:25:57,892
See you later, Will.
Looking good, kid.

1024
01:25:59,292 --> 01:26:00,795
Stay on that path.

coherent enough, Mrs. Foster.

1028
01:26:15,342 --> 01:26:17,444
The new neurosonic treatment
with Dr. Von

1029
01:26:17,578 --> 01:26:19,047
seems to be working.

1030
01:26:19,179 --> 01:26:20,915
His last MRI shows
much higher brain activity.

1031
01:26:21,049 --> 01:26:24,184
We-- we just need
to keep being patient.

1032
01:26:25,753 --> 01:26:28,355
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

1033
01:26:41,035 --> 01:26:42,737
I'm going to keep coming back.

1034

And I'm going
to keep bringing this.

1035
01:26:49,577 --> 01:26:51,546
And one day
you're gonna feel better.

1036
01:26:53,748 --> 01:26:55,415
Better enough to sign this.

1037
01:26:58,485 --> 01:27:00,387
