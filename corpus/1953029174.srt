1
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:37,994
Two days ago, I received a letter
from a lawyer in Europe.

2
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:41,999
It regretted to inform me my mother
had died in a helicopter crash.

3
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:46,094
She was returning from her sold out
farewell concert in London.

4
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:53,374
Her estate was to be turned over
to me, the letter said,

5
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:56,380
but my physical presence was
required immediately...

6
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,983
Everything had been arranged,

7
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,750
a plane ticket to Heathrow,
a car waiting...

8
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,416
only the timing couldn't
have been worse.

9
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,858
Last month I released
my first album,

10
00:02:09,996 --> 00:02:11,964
it got rave reviews in the US

11
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:15,033
and we were just starting our
debut American tour.

12
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,295
Maybe this sounds a little
cold-hearted,

13
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,735
but the fact is, she has refused
to see me

14
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:23,536
or even speak to me ever since she
left home when I was only three.

15
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:24,904
I never knew why...

16
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,691
Everything I knew about her came
from the tabloids,

17
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,921
how she'd become a
recluse rock star,

18
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:46,930
hiding out in a castle
nobody'd ever heard of.

19
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:50,229
But why did she want to give this..
this place to me?

20
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,770
She never returned a single letter
I wrote,

21
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:56,034
never helped with the band,
even indirectly.

22
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,111
And after we worked so hard to
finally get our big break

23
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,736
now she calls me from the grave...

24
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:29,703
Well, I hope what they say isn't true
about curiosity killing the cat

25
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,588
Hello?

26
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,457
Hello?!

27
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:40,679
Hello, anybody home?!

28
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:45,484
Anybody alive in here?

29
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,381
What in the...?

30
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,563
Uh... What's goin on here?

31
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:01,097
Okay, this is getting a little weird.

32
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:06,028
Hey... What do you want from me?

33
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,072
Whoah, guys.

34
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,509
Look, can I help you with something?

35
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,275
Fellas?

36
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,987
Oooooh...

37
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:25,056
Hey... Watch it!... Listen,

38
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,887
I think we have a
misunderstanding here.

39
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:29,995
Little help here!!

40
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:33,331
Wooooooo...

41
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,527
Little help in here please

42
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,582
That felt so good.

43
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,415
Huh? What is this?

44
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,523
We have an uninvited guest.

45
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:00,023
Let me take care of you,
little bird.

46
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:08,395
Now for you, Johnny.

47
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:12,564
Welcome. We've been expecting you...

48
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:16,903
Go upstairs, Johnny.
Mr. D is waiting for you!!!

49
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,847
Looks like I have no choice.

50
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:30,250
Okay, either I've lost my mind or
I'm having really bad jet lag...

51
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,129
Now what?

52
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,639
Where the heck am I?

53
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:56,933
Wait a minute. I know that voice..

54
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,351
Mother?

55
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:15,340
Johnny, your mother was beautiful
when she was young.

56
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:19,611
And she was good, very good,
Johnny.

57
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,614
You're mother could have been
a superstar.

58
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,586
She had the talent.

59
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:27,352
But she drove a hard bargain.

60
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:30,656
One of the conditions of
her contract was that

61
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,458
you were strictly off limits.

62
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,089
You were her baby.

63
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:38,260
A rather touching performance
really.

64
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:43,103
Anyway I kept my end of the
bargain of course.

65
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:46,803
Alas, she could not keep hers.

66
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,880
So you've been summoned,

67
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:53,475
and what was once hers I can now
offer to you.

68
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,111
I know exactly what
you're getting at.

69
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:59,452
Really. Enlighten me.

70
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:02,459
I'm having a really weird dream,
and I can't wake up.

71
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,790
This is better than a dream,
Johnny.

72
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,160
This is immortality.

73
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:11,099
I can make you the the greatest
rock legend of all time.

74
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:14,934
All you have to do is sign on
a little dotted line.

75
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,166
Now I know who you are.

76
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:17,434
No way! I'm not sign-

77
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:21,239
That's what they all say...
at first.

78
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:36,052
You really believe you have talent
to make it on your own?

79
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,459
That's the dream Johnny.

80
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:41,464
In the real world, you need Mr.D.

81
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,660
He can make you everything
you ever wanted to be.

82
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:50,071
But we understand if you
have some... reservations.

83
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,040
Well, perhaps you better
look around

84
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,078
before you make your
final decision.

85
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,875
Just to be sure

86
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:12,830
Johnny, You must find
your way out.

87
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:16,196
Don't let them get to you.
Don't...

88
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:18,326
Who are you?

89
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,129
Oh, God!

90
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,733
What have I gotten myself into?

91
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,434
Interesting place
don't you think?

92
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,299
Here's the lowdown, Johnny.

93
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,567
Centuries ago, music played
a relatively minor part

94
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,837
in the larger scheme of things
within the corporation.

95
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,743
It was so difficult to find good
recruits, not like politics.

96
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,907
We barely met our quotas.

97
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:36,317
Every now and then a client
would try to reneg on his deal-

98
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,424
Musicians don't read contracts
very carefully you know -

99
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,459
so we would dig a new cave down here
and confine the subject

100
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:47,930
to a life of total anonymity
and of course perpetual noise.

101
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,967
Drives ya nuts.

102
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:55,104
Long story short, music just wasn't
much of a draw.

103
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,606
At some point there was even a plan
within the corporation

104
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,177
to scrap our division altogether.

105
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:03,008
So, fast forward, the Big Idea.

106
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,173
It was really my idea but...

107
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:06,909
Not important.

108
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:11,011
At first we wanted to call it
Twist and Burn - little too obvious

109
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:13,488
so we settled on Rock and Roll.

110
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,149
Business went through the roof.

111
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:19,924
By the time the sixties rolled around
our little division was on fuego.

112
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,293
Huge growth.

113
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,298
Our only problem was space.

114
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,097
Let me tell you, when you're
dealing with damned souls,

115
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:29,230
storage is always a big problem.

116
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:32,275
So Mr.D. had to come up
with a new scheme.

117
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,436
This you gotta see.

118
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,164
Funny thing about rock stars,

119
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,868
the instant they become
rich and famous,

120
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,309
they tend to think
their invincible.

121
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,710
Stop living up to
their commitments.

122
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:47,979
Even have the audacity to try to
break their contracts.

123
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,181
But let me tell you, one does not
break a deal with Mr.D.

124
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,096
But they tried and we build
this place all for them.

125
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:03,065
You see we use the deal-breakers
to provide entertainment

126
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,965
for members of the corporation.

127
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:07,196
Works out rather well.

128
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,802
From time to time Mr.D.
gathers the troops

129
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:15,107
- a little attitude adjustment
party we like to call it

130
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:18,273
- and we have one hell of
a good time...

131
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,885
Have fun. AHAA...

132
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:53,107
Welcome to our show.
If you like the band

133
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,743
please applaud as hard
as you can.

134
00:20:55,887 --> 00:21:00,017
If not... applaud anyway.

135
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:04,219
Turn around Johnny.
You must leave this place.

136
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,422
I came this far,
I might as well see the show.

137
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:09,125
This is not a show
you want to see, Johnny.

138
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,328
Once they get to you,
there is no turning back!

139
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:16,407
Don't do it for me,
do it for yourself!

140
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:19,601
But wait, who are you?! Mom?

141
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,337
Man, this is getting too weird.

142
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,879
Welcome to our show.

143
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:26,610
If you like the band please
applaud as hard as you can.

144
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,846
If not... applaud anyway.

145
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:57,132
Johnny! What are you
doing down here?!

146
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:59,505
I don't know. I just...

147
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:01,305
This place is off-limits.

148
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:04,347
Way off-limits.
I HATE this place.

149
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:05,506
Let's get out of here.

150
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,618
Opera isn't very popular here,
is it?

151
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:10,550
HAAA... you don't know
the half of it.

152
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:16,989
Mr. D used to love opera too,
hardcore opera fan.

153
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,596
Then he got involved with an
opera star.

154
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:23,963
Long story, but she left him,
broke her deal.

155
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:28,163
Mr. D went totally berserk.

156
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:31,002
Opera is now officially taboo
upstairs.

157
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:33,337
Whenever any opera singers
break their contract,

158
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:36,242
he gets a little...
out of control

159
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:44,555
Never mind.
Nothing to do with you, Johnny.

160
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:48,987
Now you must go.
Mr. D is getting impatient.

161
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:51,027
The time has come...

162
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,951
Good.
Come here, Johnny...

163
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:19,045
I want to show you something -
your future.

164
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:23,187
You know you have a good voice,

165
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:27,162
but would you like to be
a great guitar player as well?

166
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:29,732
I'll make a Rock legend out of you,

167
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:31,927
it would be all yours,

168
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,061
everything you ever wanted,

169
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:36,105
let me show you.

170
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:09,103
Yes. Good. Goooood. Good.

171
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:19,210
Johnny?

172
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,513
Mom... this one's for you.
