1
00:00:24,384 --> 00:00:25,851
You were right, Varinia.

2
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,884
Vengeance alone is not enough.

3
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:34,686
To become like your enemy
is to lose to him.

4
00:00:35,728 --> 00:00:38,856
But what's important isn't our
living or our dying...

5
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:43,766
but this new thing we've
created, however briefly.

6
00:00:44,404 --> 00:00:46,804
A world without slaves.

7
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:53,843
And if you die, who will
tell that story?

8
00:00:55,281 --> 00:00:58,842
Live, so that I will live.

9
00:00:59,285 --> 00:01:02,083
So that we will live on.

10
00:01:02,255 --> 00:01:06,214
So that it won't be wasted
or forgotten.

11
00:01:16,703 --> 00:01:19,194
Did you see the look
he gave you, Varinia?

12
00:01:19,339 --> 00:01:20,738
I didn't.

13
00:01:20,874 --> 00:01:22,899
And even if I had...

14
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:24,407
I wouldn't care.

15
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:27,537
What sort of look?

16
00:01:27,714 --> 00:01:29,511
What look, you?

17
00:01:29,816 --> 00:01:30,908
What look?

18
00:01:39,826 --> 00:01:41,817
You tell me!

19
00:02:56,502 --> 00:02:59,335
I made a promise once
to tell our story.

20
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:02,407
It began in a small village
in Gaul...

21
00:03:03,042 --> 00:03:05,067
where I was born a free woman.

22
00:03:06,913 --> 00:03:10,781
Then the Romans destroyed my world
and made me a slave.

23
00:03:11,284 --> 00:03:13,878
Nothing and no one could
stand against the Romans.

24
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:29,063
But Rome herself was torn
by conflict.

25
00:03:29,235 --> 00:03:31,499
Bloody civil wars
raged for years...

26
00:03:31,638 --> 00:03:34,505
between plebeians and their
rivals, the patricians...

27
00:03:34,874 --> 00:03:38,867
led by Senator Marcus Crassus,
the richest man in the world.

28
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:42,707
As a child, he had seen his father
murdered in the Forum.

29
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:45,283
Crassus had risen from the
ashes of his family's defeat...

30
00:03:45,451 --> 00:03:50,013
to unlimited wealth
and ambition.

31
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,951
Ambition kept in check only by his
rivals like Antonius Agrippa.

32
00:03:55,228 --> 00:03:58,823
The civil wars were over. Men
smiled at one another in public.

33
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:01,699
But the fighting never stopped.

34
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:04,431
Fishing for votes?

35
00:04:04,604 --> 00:04:07,232
No, just enjoying our
democratic way of life.

36
00:04:08,341 --> 00:04:10,707
A new wine. From Spain.

37
00:04:12,912 --> 00:04:15,813
Delicious. But I like your
cupbearer better.

38
00:04:15,982 --> 00:04:17,916
Any news from Spain
along with the wine?

39
00:04:18,051 --> 00:04:20,611
- A great victory by Pompey.
- Another?

40
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,246
The man is positively
boring in his triumphs.

41
00:04:24,624 --> 00:04:28,390
I shall console myself with the way
Crassus must feel.

42
00:04:34,767 --> 00:04:36,667
Pompey's no great warrior.

43
00:04:37,103 --> 00:04:40,664
He got so fat on the riches of his
triumphs he can't ride his horse.

44
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,774
Disparage Pompey all you like
but the man gets the job done.

45
00:04:45,211 --> 00:04:47,702
Victory over a handful of
vermin ridden Gaulish peasants...

46
00:04:47,847 --> 00:04:50,782
is hardly the mark of
military distinction.

47
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:53,283
They say he will be Consul.

48
00:04:53,486 --> 00:04:56,080
This grape...

49
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,786
is not to my satisfaction.
More wine.

50
00:05:02,662 --> 00:05:06,154
I think I'm going to
borrow your wife, Cornelius.

51
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,033
The wealth of a man like Crassus
could be seen in gold or silver...

52
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,134
but it's true measure
was in flesh.

53
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,435
Thousands of slaves.

54
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:23,309
They lived out their short lives
in a world of suffering...

55
00:05:23,483 --> 00:05:25,917
at the whim of their masters.

56
00:05:26,052 --> 00:05:28,714
No Roman citizen gave them
a second thought.

57
00:05:45,238 --> 00:05:47,229
Greetings, citizens.

58
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,076
Today we offer a group of
barbarians from Gaul...

59
00:05:51,244 --> 00:05:55,112
courtesy of the great Pompey.

60
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:59,383
Ahoy, Batiatus.
What brings you up from Capua?

61
00:05:59,685 --> 00:06:01,949
The same thing as you,
I would imagine.

62
00:06:02,088 --> 00:06:04,352
My stock needs freshening.

63
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,158
Although how a man from the country
can bid against a Senator...

64
00:06:07,293 --> 00:06:12,128
- I might as well go home.
- A modest man from the country?

65
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:16,324
Yours is widely known as the finest
gladiatorial school in all Italy.

66
00:06:16,636 --> 00:06:19,366
- You flatter me.
- No, not in the least.

67
00:06:23,543 --> 00:06:26,103
Look at this beauty.
And a virgin.

68
00:06:26,245 --> 00:06:30,511
A virgin. Given the appetite of
our frontier troops, I doubt that.

69
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,280
Being a virgin is overrated.

70
00:06:33,453 --> 00:06:36,115
It's just an excuse to inflate
the price.

71
00:06:36,255 --> 00:06:38,746
Good teeth.
Wide hips.

72
00:06:38,925 --> 00:06:41,758
And an excellent breeder.

73
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:46,854
Magnificent.

74
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:49,194
She's easy on the eye,
I'll grant you...

75
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:52,132
but these Gauls have
thin blood.

76
00:06:52,305 --> 00:06:55,968
They rarely last the winter. I'd be
like throwing your money away.

77
00:06:56,843 --> 00:06:59,641
Why, Batiatus,
are you in love?

78
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:03,640
Don't worry, my friend.
I won't bid against you.

79
00:07:03,816 --> 00:07:05,408
You're too kind, Senator.

80
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:08,145
- But I may need a favor some day.
- Of course.

81
00:07:08,888 --> 00:07:14,258
- Five hundred sesterces!
- Done!

82
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:21,826
How can the Senate choose Pompey
over you as the next Consul?

83
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:25,963
It would be a close vote.

84
00:07:31,944 --> 00:07:34,071
I bought you a gift.

85
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:37,806
It's beautiful.

86
00:07:38,217 --> 00:07:40,879
- You are too generous.
- Am I?

87
00:07:41,654 --> 00:07:43,713
Well, I suppose I might be.

88
00:07:43,856 --> 00:07:46,051
In the arms of the
richest man in Rome...

89
00:07:46,192 --> 00:07:48,353
- and her husband's best friend...
- Show me.

90
00:07:48,694 --> 00:07:52,596
Helena might be forgiven her
ignorance of the bracelet's origin.

91
00:07:52,732 --> 00:07:54,757
It's true cost.

92
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:00,168
What is hell?

93
00:08:00,706 --> 00:08:04,642
Hell is that place where the
simplest action becomes painful.

94
00:08:05,378 --> 00:08:07,505
Where it hurts to walk...

95
00:08:07,914 --> 00:08:10,906
to breathe, even to think.

96
00:08:12,818 --> 00:08:15,446
The gold mines of Egypt
were such a hell.

97
00:08:16,489 --> 00:08:19,219
Among the Thracian slaves
condemned to an early death...

98
00:08:19,358 --> 00:08:21,553
one would shake
the Roman world.

99
00:08:23,763 --> 00:08:26,994
His name: Spartacus.

100
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,316
Pick it up!

101
00:08:49,221 --> 00:08:51,052
Pick it up!

102
00:08:59,565 --> 00:09:00,293
No!

103
00:10:12,872 --> 00:10:14,203
Stop!

104
00:10:18,878 --> 00:10:20,869
So he's a Thracian, yes?

105
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,239
Worse. He's an animal.

106
00:10:23,382 --> 00:10:26,249
Good. That's even better.

107
00:10:27,153 --> 00:10:29,383
This is your lucky day,
Thracian.

108
00:11:17,837 --> 00:11:19,566
What kind of a place is this?

109
00:11:44,263 --> 00:11:45,389
Move!

110
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,131
Fresh meat!

111
00:11:49,401 --> 00:11:51,665
Shut your hole!
Get back to work.

112
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,003
You stink, animals.
Clean yourselves.

113
00:12:13,058 --> 00:12:13,922
This way.

114
00:12:38,184 --> 00:12:42,052
I want these cut into thin slices.
I wouldn't give this to a dog!

115
00:12:48,327 --> 00:12:49,954
I could get used to this.

116
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:57,365
I am Gannicus.
This is Spartacus.

117
00:13:00,105 --> 00:13:04,667
David the Jew. He never talks.
Some say he can't.

118
00:13:05,344 --> 00:13:06,936
You're Thracians?

119
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,343
- The crowd likes Thracians.
- Be quiet, Nordo. Eat.

120
00:13:12,284 --> 00:13:14,479
Didn't get your name, friend.

121
00:13:14,987 --> 00:13:19,651
You're not my friend. I don't wanna
know your name, your story.

122
00:13:19,825 --> 00:13:21,554
Why not?

123
00:13:21,727 --> 00:13:24,958
I might meet you in the arena
some day, and then I'll kill you.

124
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:26,788
Why wait?

125
00:13:38,978 --> 00:13:40,969
You'll have plenty of chances
to fight.

126
00:13:41,413 --> 00:13:43,813
Save it for when you
have no choice. Eat.

127
00:13:49,722 --> 00:13:51,747
You must be the new Thracians.

128
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:56,284
I can almost tell Thracians.
You stink like pigs.

129
00:13:58,397 --> 00:14:01,992
- You must be Crixus.
- You've heard of me.

130
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:06,069
Who hasn't? "Crixus the big nose."
Not surprised you could smell us.

131
00:14:42,508 --> 00:14:43,805
Enough!

132
00:14:45,644 --> 00:14:48,044
To your cells! Now!

133
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,914
Well, move, slaves!

134
00:15:01,427 --> 00:15:03,793
You, Spartacus.

135
00:15:04,563 --> 00:15:06,428
Where did you learn to fight?

136
00:15:12,104 --> 00:15:15,904
When a Roman asks you
a question, you answer, slave.

137
00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:19,736
Fighting Romans.

138
00:15:31,023 --> 00:15:35,585
Crassus. What a
pleasant surprise.

139
00:15:35,761 --> 00:15:38,286
I had no idea you still partook
of such common pleasures...

140
00:15:38,464 --> 00:15:40,557
as our public baths.

141
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:43,702
I do not disdain the public.

142
00:15:44,603 --> 00:15:47,902
You love mankind. It's only
people you can't stand.

143
00:15:48,107 --> 00:15:52,271
Now, why is it that those who are
most in favor of mob rule...

144
00:15:52,444 --> 00:15:56,403
stand most to benefit from the
public's greed and stupidity?

145
00:15:56,548 --> 00:15:59,813
Why is it that the rich are
always so keen on reform...

146
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:02,819
after they've made their
fortune and not before?

147
00:16:02,988 --> 00:16:05,548
The Republic was a fine form
of government...

148
00:16:05,691 --> 00:16:08,182
when Rome was a
backwater city state.

149
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,954
Times have changed.
Rome rules the world now.

150
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,759
And one man with a strong
vision must rule Rome.

151
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,701
So power should be wielded
by whom?

152
00:16:19,838 --> 00:16:23,501
The educated? The wealthy?
The aristocrat? By Crassus?

153
00:16:24,576 --> 00:16:27,477
Or by Pompey?

154
00:16:27,713 --> 00:16:32,343
Plato did say that leadership must
be left to the educated.

155
00:16:33,018 --> 00:16:37,216
That leaves Pompey out.
Julius Caesar, you mean.

156
00:16:37,523 --> 00:16:39,923
You've heard what
they say about him.

157
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,493
"Every woman's man and
every man's woman."

158
00:16:49,101 --> 00:16:52,298
But you're right,
Pompey overreaches.

159
00:16:52,938 --> 00:16:56,806
If he's not careful, his head will
be found hanging in the Forum...

160
00:16:56,942 --> 00:16:59,740
just like that of your father
and your brother.

161
00:17:07,453 --> 00:17:10,354
Was it something I said?

162
00:17:10,722 --> 00:17:14,249
This is the Roman short sword...

163
00:17:15,094 --> 00:17:20,396
the Gladius. From which
you get your names.

164
00:17:20,632 --> 00:17:24,295
Twenty-two inches long,
three pounds in weight.

165
00:17:25,804 --> 00:17:29,262
A stabbing weapon
for close work.

166
00:17:30,776 --> 00:17:35,042
You kill a man with this and
you can smell his sweat...

167
00:17:35,747 --> 00:17:38,113
taste his breath.

168
00:17:38,283 --> 00:17:40,581
But you sons of whores...

169
00:17:40,953 --> 00:17:43,717
aren't worthy of fighting
with the Gladius yet.

170
00:17:44,556 --> 00:17:47,753
So you will use...

171
00:17:47,926 --> 00:17:51,657
these wooden swords
while I teach you.

172
00:17:56,301 --> 00:17:59,464
You, slave.

173
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,303
Pick it up.

174
00:18:04,143 --> 00:18:05,804
Come at me.

175
00:18:21,126 --> 00:18:23,117
Again.

176
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:37,941
Too slow, slave.
Pick it up.

177
00:18:45,217 --> 00:18:46,775
Too slow.

178
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:37,791
Cinna!

179
00:19:40,205 --> 00:19:43,436
So what do you think of our
new Thracian slaves? Good, huh?

180
00:19:44,543 --> 00:19:48,138
They have spirit,
but no real talent.

181
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,077
I see. So you think
they're just very lucky?

182
00:19:52,217 --> 00:19:54,208
And Cinna...

183
00:19:55,554 --> 00:19:59,081
this boy was very expensive.

184
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:02,460
Don't damage my property.

185
00:20:22,247 --> 00:20:24,442
Enough! Go! Bring her.

186
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,131
Come.

187
00:20:46,305 --> 00:20:48,273
Come here.

188
00:20:56,815 --> 00:20:58,339
Very good.

189
00:21:01,186 --> 00:21:02,414
Better.

190
00:21:03,989 --> 00:21:05,183
Come.

191
00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:12,726
Let me smell your hair.

192
00:21:21,206 --> 00:21:22,537
You know...

193
00:21:23,675 --> 00:21:28,612
I can be a very good master.

194
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,407
Oh, yes. Now, now...

195
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:37,015
- now kiss me.
- No! No!

196
00:21:51,002 --> 00:21:52,162
Hold her!

197
00:22:03,014 --> 00:22:04,675
Hey, Spartacus.

198
00:22:24,703 --> 00:22:27,570
- How's your nose?
- You got lucky.

199
00:22:27,706 --> 00:22:29,230
Do I have to break it again?

200
00:22:32,677 --> 00:22:35,646
- So where did you fight Romans?
- Thrace.

201
00:22:36,681 --> 00:22:40,447
- You?
- Gaul, where I was caught.

202
00:22:40,585 --> 00:22:42,849
And then later in Sicily
where slaves rebelled.

203
00:22:42,954 --> 00:22:45,514
- You rebelled?
- Two times.

204
00:22:45,624 --> 00:22:48,752
The Romans were terrified of us.
They still are.

205
00:22:50,695 --> 00:22:53,960
Now they kill a man just
for talking about it.

206
00:22:54,733 --> 00:22:56,564
Why did it fail?

207
00:22:56,735 --> 00:22:59,829
Fighting Romans is like
fighting a grist mill.

208
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:02,973
The stone keeps on turning.

209
00:23:03,141 --> 00:23:05,735
No matter how many times
you attack it in the end...

210
00:23:06,111 --> 00:23:08,136
it grinds you down to dust.

211
00:23:20,992 --> 00:23:22,425
Faster!

212
00:23:29,935 --> 00:23:32,426
Put your backs into it,
you sons of whores!

213
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,868
Why do Africans use
the spear and the net?

214
00:24:05,036 --> 00:24:07,732
I amuses the Romans to turn us
into fishermen.

215
00:24:09,107 --> 00:24:13,100
I was a farmer. I never saw a net
until I came here.

216
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:15,974
Nordo, this man is trouble.
Leave him be.

217
00:24:16,181 --> 00:24:19,673
In the ring, Draba, they ever pit
the knife against the spear?

218
00:24:19,985 --> 00:24:22,818
The spear always wins.

219
00:24:23,788 --> 00:24:26,256
Enough talking! Back to work.

220
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:29,390
Well, move, you scum!

221
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:32,188
Put your body behind the blow!

222
00:24:32,564 --> 00:24:34,555
Good, Draba! Push him back.

223
00:24:35,467 --> 00:24:36,764
Faster!

224
00:24:37,302 --> 00:24:39,827
Harder! Are you men
or are you women?

225
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:45,977
Tomorrow some of you
have the honor...

226
00:24:46,311 --> 00:24:48,939
of fighting in the arena
in Capua.

227
00:24:49,347 --> 00:24:53,283
Nothing matters but that you
fight well and with courage.

228
00:24:53,852 --> 00:24:57,413
Do this and even the defeated
may receive mercy.

229
00:24:58,423 --> 00:25:02,223
However if that
is not your fate...

230
00:25:02,694 --> 00:25:06,095
then the crowd will expect you
to meet your death honorably...

231
00:25:06,197 --> 00:25:10,634
in the Roman manner,
like this.

232
00:25:11,369 --> 00:25:16,830
Spartacus, kneel.

233
00:25:23,014 --> 00:25:27,417
A defeated gladiator may
beg for mercy...

234
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:31,947
by raising his hand thus.

235
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:38,925
The death blow is delivered in a
single thrust to the neck...

236
00:25:39,064 --> 00:25:42,033
here.

237
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:53,702
That is how a gladiator from the
house of Batiatus dies.

238
00:26:05,223 --> 00:26:08,886
What's the matter, Thracian?
Lost your appetite? Eat. Drink.

239
00:26:09,327 --> 00:26:12,524
- Tomorrow we die.
- I'm not dying tomorrow.

240
00:26:13,164 --> 00:26:15,632
The gods decide when we die.

241
00:26:16,234 --> 00:26:19,863
- I don't believe in the gods.
- You don't believe in the gods?

242
00:26:20,338 --> 00:26:22,806
When I look at the heavens
I see only stars.

243
00:26:22,941 --> 00:26:26,206
Blasphemer! You could be
struck down for that.

244
00:26:27,445 --> 00:26:29,777
No bolt of lightning.

245
00:26:33,752 --> 00:26:36,915
- So what do you believe in?
- Us.

246
00:26:37,656 --> 00:26:39,783
Our will.

247
00:26:40,191 --> 00:26:42,489
We decide when
we die and how.

248
00:26:43,128 --> 00:26:47,030
Well, eat anyway. You'll need
your strength for tonight.

249
00:26:47,165 --> 00:26:50,134
- What happens tonight?
- War, little Thracian.

250
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:51,869
Sweet war!

251
00:26:57,142 --> 00:26:59,235
Quiet! Sit down!

252
00:27:00,812 --> 00:27:02,871
A little wisdom.

253
00:27:03,048 --> 00:27:08,315
A man is no good in the
arena if his parts shrivel up.

254
00:27:09,688 --> 00:27:13,215
A gladiator is not
a litter slave.

255
00:27:13,558 --> 00:27:15,492
- He is a man.
- Yeah!

256
00:27:16,327 --> 00:27:20,286
And a man needs a woman.

257
00:27:31,743 --> 00:27:33,608
Quiet, quiet.

258
00:27:34,112 --> 00:27:37,775
For those of you
who fight tomorrow...

259
00:27:38,483 --> 00:27:42,214
I graciously lend you
these lovelies.

260
00:27:42,887 --> 00:27:46,288
Use them well.
And in the morning...

261
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:51,388
show me what men
you are. Cinna!

262
00:27:59,571 --> 00:28:01,163
This is yours.

263
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,441
Idiot!
David doesn't fight tomorrow.

264
00:28:08,713 --> 00:28:10,340
Crixus.

265
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:15,181
You like to play rough,
Thracian. Here.

266
00:28:15,987 --> 00:28:19,115
Batiatus asks that she be
made more pliant.

267
00:28:19,457 --> 00:28:20,651
See to it.

268
00:28:48,253 --> 00:28:49,948
I'm Spartacus.

269
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,521
What are you called?

270
00:29:00,265 --> 00:29:03,063
You look cold. Here.

271
00:29:04,602 --> 00:29:07,298
The stones are cold at night.

272
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,806
You sleep there.
I won't bother you.

273
00:29:45,844 --> 00:29:48,870
Wake up, you sons of whores!

274
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,612
Move already!

275
00:30:00,124 --> 00:30:01,853
My name is Varinia.

276
00:30:04,062 --> 00:30:05,893
Varinia.

277
00:30:07,065 --> 00:30:08,623
Come out, now.

278
00:30:12,537 --> 00:30:15,370
Today you are expected
to bring honor...

279
00:30:15,573 --> 00:30:18,565
to the house of Batiatus.

280
00:30:20,044 --> 00:30:24,174
Fail to do so and you will curse
the day you were born.

281
00:30:26,284 --> 00:30:28,514
- Where are they going?
- Capua.

282
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,317
They fight today.

283
00:30:31,089 --> 00:30:34,650
The Thracian, the one they call
Spartacus. Is he any good?

284
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:38,420
Couldn't say.
He's different, though.

285
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:41,022
How?

286
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:44,028
All the gladiators here are
strong men. Brave.

287
00:30:44,235 --> 00:30:48,501
But they are still slaves.
They accept it. Not him.

288
00:30:49,307 --> 00:30:52,242
He will not last long.

289
00:30:54,245 --> 00:30:56,907
You were with him last night?

290
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:03,481
- Yes and no.
- You, girl!

291
00:31:04,122 --> 00:31:06,352
Come here.

292
00:31:10,895 --> 00:31:12,658
You will attend me
at the games.

293
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,821
But if you give me
any trouble...

294
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:20,301
I promise that our previous meeting
will feel like a mother's caress.

295
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:22,973
Now, go and get yourself
cleaned up.

296
00:31:32,617 --> 00:31:33,948
Line up!

297
00:31:46,397 --> 00:31:49,889
I appreciate your contribution
to my games, Batiatus.

298
00:31:50,201 --> 00:31:53,170
Few people understand the financial
burden I'm expected to shoulder...

299
00:31:53,304 --> 00:31:56,239
while on duty in these
dreary provinces.

300
00:31:56,407 --> 00:31:59,968
Thank you. And I appreciate
the loan of your troops.

301
00:32:00,144 --> 00:32:02,078
Security at an establishment
like mine...

302
00:32:02,213 --> 00:32:04,374
does not come cheaply either.

303
00:32:04,949 --> 00:32:08,077
- One hand washes the other.
- Of course. More wine!

304
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:15,386
A perfectly ripened pear.

305
00:32:15,994 --> 00:32:20,055
- Although somewhat bruised.
- A problem with discipline.

306
00:32:20,465 --> 00:32:23,195
But we're working on it.
Aren't we?

307
00:32:23,968 --> 00:32:25,629
Yes, my Lord.

308
00:32:40,485 --> 00:32:44,285
- On the crosses. Who are they?
- Arsonists.

309
00:32:46,124 --> 00:32:49,116
They wear the tunica molesta,
soaked in pitch.

310
00:32:58,903 --> 00:33:01,064
Change your mind
about the gods?

311
00:33:08,479 --> 00:33:10,640
If there are gods
in this world...

312
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:13,210
they're not here.

313
00:33:13,851 --> 00:33:16,979
Burn! Burn!

314
00:33:51,923 --> 00:33:55,916
Crixus verses Gaius.

315
00:33:57,762 --> 00:34:02,722
Gannicus verses Antonius.

316
00:34:04,135 --> 00:34:08,196
Spartacus verses Commodus.

317
00:34:10,541 --> 00:34:14,204
This new gladiator, Spartacus,
is he really a Thracian...

318
00:34:14,712 --> 00:34:16,942
or are you still
passing off Greeks?

319
00:34:17,048 --> 00:34:19,710
He's the real thing,
through and through.

320
00:34:19,884 --> 00:34:21,317
Any good?

321
00:34:21,452 --> 00:34:24,080
Cinna thinks the world of him.
Don't you, Cinna?

322
00:34:24,322 --> 00:34:27,450
Very well. A thousand
on Spartacus.

323
00:35:38,829 --> 00:35:40,854
Kill! Kill!

324
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:45,232
Kill! Kill!

325
00:36:40,825 --> 00:36:42,383
Are you hurt?

326
00:36:43,728 --> 00:36:47,095
I thought in the mines I'd seen
man at his worst.

327
00:36:47,865 --> 00:36:49,730
I was wrong.

328
00:36:50,534 --> 00:36:53,230
- A slave has no choice.
- Not me.

329
00:36:53,704 --> 00:36:57,640
The ones who watched, took their
pleasure in blood and death.

330
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,818
Good move, Thrace!

331
00:37:09,086 --> 00:37:13,045
Harder! Faster!
Put your back to it!

332
00:37:50,461 --> 00:37:52,656
Can't you lay with me,
Spartacus?

333
00:38:00,004 --> 00:38:02,529
- Is it because Cinna ordered it?
- Because Cinna ordered it.

334
00:38:05,276 --> 00:38:08,712
And Thracian men and women
are to remain chaste...

335
00:38:08,879 --> 00:38:10,471
until they're married.

336
00:38:10,581 --> 00:38:13,641
- Slaves don't marry.
- I would marry you.

337
00:38:16,187 --> 00:38:19,088
Marriage requires a holy man.

338
00:38:19,957 --> 00:38:22,084
I thought you didn't believe
in the gods.

339
00:38:22,226 --> 00:38:24,786
I believe in what I can see,
hear and touch.

340
00:38:25,529 --> 00:38:28,293
My tribe believes that man
was created by the gods.

341
00:38:28,466 --> 00:38:31,697
- That they live in us.
- We're flesh and blood, that's all.

342
00:38:31,836 --> 00:38:35,101
That is what an animal is. The
Romans say that we're animals.

343
00:38:36,207 --> 00:38:38,505
That we are without souls.

344
00:38:38,676 --> 00:38:41,338
But you are afraid to say
that you agree with the Romans.

345
00:38:51,822 --> 00:38:56,054
I believe that I never met anyone
like you, Varinia of Gaul...

346
00:38:58,796 --> 00:39:01,264
and that I love you.

347
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:08,102
Will you marry me?

348
00:39:10,007 --> 00:39:13,135
- On what would you make a vow?
- On the blood that flows...

349
00:39:13,277 --> 00:39:15,677
through my veins
and the breath I take...

350
00:39:17,615 --> 00:39:20,482
I will be yours until
the day I die...

351
00:39:20,618 --> 00:39:24,384
and in my life there'll be no other
but you, I swear.

352
00:39:28,592 --> 00:39:31,220
On the blood that flows
in my veins...

353
00:39:31,729 --> 00:39:33,788
and the breath I take...

354
00:39:34,031 --> 00:39:37,091
- I will be yours...
- Until the day...

355
00:39:37,234 --> 00:39:40,362
Until the day I die.

356
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,933
And in the life beyond.

357
00:39:45,075 --> 00:39:48,203
- Can you tell there's life after?
- I have faith.

358
00:39:52,483 --> 00:39:55,418
There will be no other man
but you.

359
00:39:58,155 --> 00:39:59,850
I swear.

360
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,112
Kill! Kill!

361
00:40:31,288 --> 00:40:33,256
Kill! Kill!

362
00:40:59,149 --> 00:41:01,845
Spartacus!

363
00:41:18,636 --> 00:41:22,333
Master, we have visitors,
Master, from Rome.

364
00:41:22,506 --> 00:41:26,272
Cornelius Lucius and his wife,
Helena. And Marcus Crassus.

365
00:41:27,278 --> 00:41:30,270
Marcus Crassus is here...

366
00:41:30,881 --> 00:41:33,611
and you left him
waiting outside?

367
00:41:44,728 --> 00:41:47,822
Noble Crassus. You do me
a great honor, sir.

368
00:41:47,998 --> 00:41:50,660
I am Lentulus Batiatus.
Please, sit.

369
00:41:51,602 --> 00:41:56,437
I and my establishment are here
to serve you.

370
00:41:57,441 --> 00:42:01,036
Some wine to wash away
the dust...

371
00:42:01,211 --> 00:42:05,545
and some honeyed ice,
perhaps.

372
00:42:05,716 --> 00:42:06,876
Yes?

373
00:42:08,586 --> 00:42:11,987
- How may I serve you?
- My friends and I'd appreciate...

374
00:42:12,156 --> 00:42:15,455
a private showing
of a pair of Thracians.

375
00:42:15,626 --> 00:42:18,459
Excellent choice. Your Honor
is obviously a connoisseur.

376
00:42:19,096 --> 00:42:22,793
- To the death.
- To the death?

377
00:42:23,601 --> 00:42:26,866
That's an unusual request
for a private showing.

378
00:42:28,906 --> 00:42:31,500
I see that you're joking.
That's very good.

379
00:42:31,642 --> 00:42:35,669
- Very amusing.
- I am not laughing.

380
00:42:37,448 --> 00:42:41,714
Of course you're not.
Well, you've asked for Thracians.

381
00:42:41,885 --> 00:42:45,446
That means you must want
good dagger work.

382
00:42:45,623 --> 00:42:48,649
And I have the best
in the world.

383
00:42:48,892 --> 00:42:51,554
But if you want to the death,
you won't see nuance...

384
00:42:51,695 --> 00:42:54,163
and you won't see subtlety.

385
00:42:54,465 --> 00:42:57,593
Certainly won't see quality.
Madame.

386
00:42:58,402 --> 00:43:01,565
I'm not a butcher, sir,
I am an artist.

387
00:43:01,705 --> 00:43:03,764
- Yes.
- I want to give you good fighting.

388
00:43:03,874 --> 00:43:06,741
Good fighting.
And to the death.

389
00:43:06,977 --> 00:43:09,275
I want to see courage.

390
00:43:09,413 --> 00:43:12,405
I want to see passion.
And above all...

391
00:43:12,583 --> 00:43:14,551
I want to see finality.

392
00:43:14,685 --> 00:43:16,915
But to the death
will cost you...

393
00:43:17,054 --> 00:43:20,251
- Twenty-five thousand denarii.
- My God...

394
00:43:20,391 --> 00:43:21,881
you could by an elephant
for that.

395
00:43:22,026 --> 00:43:23,323
Done.

396
00:43:23,994 --> 00:43:26,155
And I want no fakery.

397
00:43:26,263 --> 00:43:29,391
No double cut for them to both suck
the sand and pretend they're dying.

398
00:43:29,533 --> 00:43:32,900
If one of them is down,
or if both of them are down...

399
00:43:33,037 --> 00:43:35,631
I want one of your trainers
to cut their throats.

400
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,304
And they are to
understand that.

401
00:43:38,542 --> 00:43:41,511
Now, I shall leave ten thousand
on account...

402
00:43:41,645 --> 00:43:43,977
and the rest when we
have been satisfied.

403
00:43:53,557 --> 00:43:55,422
Note the Africans.

404
00:43:55,626 --> 00:43:59,084
Theirs is the finest combat and the
most skillful but it can be a bore.

405
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:02,024
It can go on and on.

406
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:08,563
To see fighting at its best you
must see Thracians.

407
00:44:08,739 --> 00:44:12,300
- Don't you agree, slave master?
- But each kind has its virtues.

408
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,145
Change of plan.

409
00:44:18,916 --> 00:44:21,851
Match me a Thracian
against a black.

410
00:44:22,419 --> 00:44:26,014
With all due respect, my Lord,
that is no match.

411
00:44:26,156 --> 00:44:28,716
A Thracian only has a dagger. And
when it's in the net he's finished.

412
00:44:28,992 --> 00:44:31,153
Yes, perhaps. But...

413
00:44:31,328 --> 00:44:33,796
Africans aren't noted
for their strategic thinking.

414
00:44:35,399 --> 00:44:37,833
Hannibal, of course,
being the exception.

415
00:44:37,968 --> 00:44:40,732
I want to see how long...

416
00:44:41,004 --> 00:44:44,940
a mentally superior but
lesser armed man can last.

417
00:44:45,309 --> 00:44:48,335
My Lord, that sort
of experimentation...

418
00:44:48,612 --> 00:44:51,445
makes for bad blood
with the men.

419
00:44:51,682 --> 00:44:54,515
Well, for twenty-five thousand
denarii...

420
00:44:54,651 --> 00:44:57,711
I think you can afford to
incur a little bad blood.

421
00:45:03,627 --> 00:45:04,821
Order!

422
00:45:07,464 --> 00:45:10,297
What is it? What is it?

423
00:45:10,434 --> 00:45:12,026
A private fight.

424
00:45:12,169 --> 00:45:15,138
- Who do you want?
- Draba.

425
00:45:17,608 --> 00:45:19,200
And David.

426
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:24,311
Now, he's a Jew, yes?

427
00:45:24,515 --> 00:45:28,246
- Yes, I know you want a Thracian...
- No, no.

428
00:45:28,986 --> 00:45:31,546
This is interesting.
Ever seen a Jew fight?

429
00:45:31,789 --> 00:45:35,281
Exceptional with the dagger and
reputed to be very bright as well.

430
00:45:35,726 --> 00:45:37,193
Who else?

431
00:45:39,897 --> 00:45:44,493
Spartacus and Polymus.

432
00:45:50,107 --> 00:45:52,769
Spartacus?

433
00:46:01,385 --> 00:46:03,410
How do you like them?

434
00:46:08,425 --> 00:46:11,588
All. Except that one.

435
00:46:12,996 --> 00:46:15,123
I don't like him.

436
00:46:15,866 --> 00:46:18,630
Forgive me, lady,
but that man...

437
00:46:18,769 --> 00:46:22,000
has been in the ring twelve times.
He's very good, strong and quick.

438
00:46:22,439 --> 00:46:26,136
- Who will you match him with?
- With the African.

439
00:47:28,472 --> 00:47:31,669
- What are you doing?
- Praying.

440
00:47:36,013 --> 00:47:39,346
How do you pray?

441
00:47:40,651 --> 00:47:42,778
I can show you.

442
00:47:46,957 --> 00:47:48,822
Will you do something for me?

443
00:47:49,426 --> 00:47:51,951
Something that
we do in our tribe?

444
00:47:52,663 --> 00:47:56,292
Put your mouth on mine and
breath your soul into me...

445
00:47:57,067 --> 00:47:59,763
and I'll breath mine
into you.

446
00:48:00,103 --> 00:48:03,197
And then for all time our
souls will be one.

447
00:48:04,107 --> 00:48:06,507
One soul in two bodies.

448
00:48:18,422 --> 00:48:20,822
I will come back to you.

449
00:48:21,325 --> 00:48:24,055
If you don't,
I will kill you myself.

450
00:48:32,336 --> 00:48:34,668
You have to save your strength
for tomorrow.

451
00:48:34,805 --> 00:48:36,432
I am full of strength.

452
00:49:10,707 --> 00:49:15,303
Dagger against net and trident.
What kind of match is that?

453
00:49:22,252 --> 00:49:23,446
Time.

454
00:49:32,195 --> 00:49:33,787
Time!

455
00:50:08,031 --> 00:50:10,295
What are they thinking,
I wonder?

456
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,968
Gladiators are animals,
pure and simple.

457
00:50:13,236 --> 00:50:16,000
If one thinks of them as people,
one loses all perspective.

458
00:50:17,174 --> 00:50:21,235
Is it true what they say about the
Jews? How they mutilate their boys?

459
00:50:21,611 --> 00:50:23,511
Would you like to see?

460
00:50:28,118 --> 00:50:30,211
Bring me the Jew
before he fights.

461
00:50:31,621 --> 00:50:33,521
Bring the Jew here.

462
00:50:38,895 --> 00:50:41,728
The rest of you,
to the House of Expectation.

463
00:50:50,507 --> 00:50:52,031
Unclothe.

464
00:50:57,781 --> 00:50:59,373
Unclothe.

465
00:51:13,997 --> 00:51:16,295
They do that to their children?

466
00:51:17,634 --> 00:51:19,226
How beastly.

467
00:51:19,369 --> 00:51:22,395
Perhaps that explains their much
vaunted skill with the knife.

468
00:51:22,973 --> 00:51:25,305
- I want the Jew to fight first.
- Of course, sir.

469
00:52:26,937 --> 00:52:30,270
- Strike!
- Kill him! Kill him!

470
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,400
- Kill him!
- Kill him, Jew!

471
00:52:33,777 --> 00:52:35,404
Why doesn't he kill him?

472
00:52:36,413 --> 00:52:38,381
Kill him!

473
00:52:40,283 --> 00:52:42,046
Why doesn't he finish him?

474
00:52:53,997 --> 00:52:56,932
Don't expect mercy from me
out there, Thracian.

475
00:52:57,801 --> 00:52:59,428
Live, Draba.

476
00:53:00,604 --> 00:53:02,936
That's what life is for.

477
00:53:07,043 --> 00:53:09,238
If the gods love you...

478
00:53:09,846 --> 00:53:12,371
you die in childhood.

479
00:53:15,085 --> 00:53:18,748
That was extraordinary.

480
00:53:18,855 --> 00:53:22,291
If the second pair is as good as
the first, I shall be well pleased.

481
00:54:44,307 --> 00:54:45,137
Strike!

482
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:48,641
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

483
00:54:48,812 --> 00:54:50,109
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

484
00:54:50,213 --> 00:54:51,544
- Kill him!
- Kill him!

485
00:54:53,016 --> 00:54:53,846
Kill him!

486
00:55:02,826 --> 00:55:04,851
Stop him!

487
00:55:47,103 --> 00:55:49,162
Why didn't he kill me?

488
00:55:56,146 --> 00:55:58,637
If he kills me, he lives.

489
00:56:00,617 --> 00:56:03,313
If he turns on
the Romans, he dies.

490
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:08,951
He chooses to die.

491
00:56:15,698 --> 00:56:17,393
Who chooses to die?

492
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:22,935
Who chooses to die?

493
00:56:25,442 --> 00:56:28,240
Maybe rather than
live as a beast...

494
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:34,113
Draba chose to die
as a man.

495
00:56:37,754 --> 00:56:39,153
Father!

496
00:56:47,797 --> 00:56:49,389
It was just a dream.

497
00:56:52,035 --> 00:56:53,696
No.

498
00:56:57,574 --> 00:56:59,701
I slept until now.

499
00:57:01,544 --> 00:57:03,671
Now I wake.

500
00:57:05,181 --> 00:57:06,512
Move, you dogs!

501
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:09,441
Move! I said move!

502
00:57:13,389 --> 00:57:14,754
Move, you scum!

503
00:57:24,033 --> 00:57:26,593
Is it true that Draba didn't kill
any of the Romans?

504
00:57:29,239 --> 00:57:31,332
If a man throw his life away...

505
00:57:31,441 --> 00:57:34,274
- he could die better than that.
- Will you die any better?

506
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:38,278
He will die like a dog, and so
will you. So will we all.

507
00:57:40,917 --> 00:57:43,010
Are you my friend, Crixus?

508
00:57:43,152 --> 00:57:47,145
- Was Draba your friend?
- Yes. And my teacher.

509
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:50,487
- Did he teach you how to die?
- He taught me how to live.

510
00:57:58,668 --> 00:58:02,900
I feed you the best food.
I give you women.

511
00:58:03,473 --> 00:58:06,306
You live here like kings
in idleness...

512
00:58:06,442 --> 00:58:08,774
on the fat of the land.

513
00:58:08,945 --> 00:58:13,041
And all I expect is your loyalty
and obedience.

514
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:16,282
And what do I get in return?

515
00:58:17,687 --> 00:58:19,450
Treachery.

516
00:58:19,556 --> 00:58:22,150
Cinna, fetch me a black man.

517
00:58:46,749 --> 00:58:48,114
Kill him.

518
00:58:55,325 --> 00:58:57,589
Now there will be
no more trouble.

519
00:58:58,227 --> 00:59:00,559
The dogs won't even growl.

520
00:59:08,805 --> 00:59:10,773
Move it, move it! You cows!

521
00:59:28,157 --> 00:59:30,318
Move, slaves!

522
00:59:34,864 --> 00:59:37,594
Are we dogs that you snap
your whips at us?

523
00:59:46,509 --> 00:59:49,842
- Spartacus! Prepare to die!
- Cinna!

524
01:00:04,193 --> 01:00:06,457
What the hell is going on
out there?

525
01:00:11,801 --> 01:00:12,768
There's too many!

526
01:00:36,526 --> 01:00:38,585
You taught me well, Cinna.

527
01:00:52,475 --> 01:00:53,965
Quiet!

528
01:00:55,178 --> 01:00:58,204
- Quiet!
- Let him speak!

529
01:00:59,782 --> 01:01:01,977
Quiet! Listen to Spartacus!

530
01:01:08,491 --> 01:01:10,652
Like you...

531
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:15,091
I've been alone
my whole life.

532
01:01:15,698 --> 01:01:18,633
We could never look
into each other's eyes.

533
01:01:20,069 --> 01:01:22,162
Living like animals.

534
01:01:23,406 --> 01:01:25,772
Here is the lesson of Draba.

535
01:01:26,342 --> 01:01:29,072
I will be a man.

536
01:01:30,012 --> 01:01:33,004
My life is my brother's.

537
01:01:33,449 --> 01:01:35,849
Live to fight the Romans!

538
01:01:37,787 --> 01:01:38,981
Smash the gates!

539
01:01:57,406 --> 01:02:00,239
Master! The gladiators!

540
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:02,441
They have revolted!

541
01:02:02,845 --> 01:02:05,336
Well, don't just stand there like
a drooling idiot. Help me!

542
01:02:08,985 --> 01:02:11,010
Field formation!

543
01:02:12,221 --> 01:02:14,815
Go get my litter.
We have to get to Capua.

544
01:02:14,957 --> 01:02:16,049
To the garrison. Go!

545
01:02:35,077 --> 01:02:36,237
Hold your positions!

546
01:03:08,311 --> 01:03:11,940
Free men and women, listen to me!
We must get ready.

547
01:03:13,015 --> 01:03:15,074
Nordo, can you open the armory?

548
01:03:15,218 --> 01:03:18,585
- Lf I have to do it with my teeth.
- Spartacus, look.

549
01:03:28,264 --> 01:03:30,960
David, go.

550
01:03:31,934 --> 01:03:33,731
Go. Talk to them.

551
01:03:37,974 --> 01:03:40,067
What do you want me to say?

552
01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:45,479
Invite our brothers to join us.

553
01:03:51,754 --> 01:03:55,349
Gifts! I bring gifts!

554
01:04:05,001 --> 01:04:08,164
Freedom for you and your children!
Come, join us!

555
01:04:08,337 --> 01:04:10,635
Freedom for you!
Join us!

556
01:04:12,041 --> 01:04:14,839
Spartacus always said that you
would speak some day.

557
01:04:17,613 --> 01:04:20,446
David, Varinia.

558
01:04:20,683 --> 01:04:23,379
- Come.
- You'll tell me later.

559
01:04:25,788 --> 01:04:28,052
There's one more thing
I need to do.

560
01:05:07,363 --> 01:05:09,388
Maecenus! Maecenus!

561
01:05:09,565 --> 01:05:11,965
Thank you, thank you.
You've got to stop them.

562
01:05:12,401 --> 01:05:16,462
- Where's that slaves headed?
- In the hills to the south of here.

563
01:05:16,639 --> 01:05:19,733
There's a lot of valuable property.
You've got to save something.

564
01:05:19,909 --> 01:05:22,469
- Too late for that. Double time!
- March!

565
01:05:23,412 --> 01:05:24,902
Please.

566
01:05:26,816 --> 01:05:28,181
Please.

567
01:05:54,310 --> 01:05:57,711
- Let's go.
- Look. They're so arrogant...

568
01:05:57,847 --> 01:06:00,145
- they've lost their formation.
- So?

569
01:06:00,249 --> 01:06:03,116
So if attacked, they'd have
to fight, man to man.

570
01:06:03,452 --> 01:06:06,285
And who fights better man to man
than gladiators?

571
01:06:07,289 --> 01:06:10,156
Crixus, Nordo.

572
01:06:14,330 --> 01:06:16,161
We have guests.

573
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,927
Should we not greet them?

574
01:07:07,283 --> 01:07:12,084
Apparently there has been an
uprising of gladiators in Capua.

575
01:07:12,321 --> 01:07:14,789
The entire garrison
has been slain...

576
01:07:14,924 --> 01:07:17,154
the slaves have taken
to the hills...

577
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:21,555
where their revolt spreads.
This is what I'm talking about...

578
01:07:21,664 --> 01:07:24,656
why we need strong leadership.

579
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,826
I propose that we send
the city cohorts...

580
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:29,835
to crush this rebellion.

581
01:07:29,939 --> 01:07:32,169
The entire garrison of Rome?

582
01:07:32,808 --> 01:07:35,834
Are you out of your mind?
To fight slaves?

583
01:07:36,011 --> 01:07:39,640
How many of these creatures
are there? Who are they led by?

584
01:07:40,683 --> 01:07:44,312
It sounds like a job for an
overseer and a pack of dogs.

585
01:07:44,453 --> 01:07:47,149
They massacred the entire
Capua garrison.

586
01:07:47,323 --> 01:07:50,121
The garrison at Capua.

587
01:07:50,226 --> 01:07:54,253
Forgive my bluntness, but an effete
band of pretend soldiers.

588
01:07:54,430 --> 01:07:56,398
A slave rebellion is never
a simple affair.

589
01:07:56,765 --> 01:08:00,565
We all remember Sicily.
Twice the slaves...

590
01:08:00,703 --> 01:08:03,035
attacked. The second time they
seized the entire island...

591
01:08:03,205 --> 01:08:06,868
for over a year! This particular
revolt is taking place...

592
01:08:07,343 --> 01:08:11,370
a mere one hundred miles from
where we now sit and squabble.

593
01:08:11,547 --> 01:08:14,914
So are you suggesting that we
recall a legion from the frontier?

594
01:08:15,117 --> 01:08:18,177
- Pompey, perhaps?
- And wait weeks for him to arrive?

595
01:08:18,354 --> 01:08:20,686
Will the slaves wait?
I don't think so.

596
01:08:21,157 --> 01:08:25,093
We must deal with this matter
promptly before it gets out of hand.

597
01:08:25,427 --> 01:08:28,658
- But the entire city cohorts?
- Three.

598
01:08:28,931 --> 01:08:32,059
- Three full cohorts.
- Under whose command?

599
01:08:32,234 --> 01:08:37,001
I realize that it is not customary
for a man to put his own name.

600
01:08:37,139 --> 01:08:39,403
Then please do not
break precedent.

601
01:08:39,608 --> 01:08:43,203
I was about to suggest...

602
01:08:43,479 --> 01:08:46,607
that the cohorts be sent
under the able command...

603
01:08:46,749 --> 01:08:49,183
of Titus Glabrus.

604
01:08:52,321 --> 01:08:56,553
My Lord, I hardly know
what to say.

605
01:08:57,860 --> 01:09:00,795
Thank you for your
confidence in me.

606
01:09:00,930 --> 01:09:04,730
If it is the will of the Senate and
the people of Rome, then I accept.

607
01:09:04,867 --> 01:09:07,529
If it is indeed the will
of the Senate...

608
01:09:07,836 --> 01:09:11,829
then Titus Glabrus go with
our blessings.

609
01:09:12,041 --> 01:09:14,669
Fall upon this rabble
with all the weight...

610
01:09:14,877 --> 01:09:17,607
and majesty of Roman law.

611
01:09:21,283 --> 01:09:23,615
We will march
across the world...

612
01:09:23,786 --> 01:09:26,346
and turn it over,
stone by stone!

613
01:09:36,165 --> 01:09:37,962
Look at them.

614
01:09:38,334 --> 01:09:41,895
They think the war is all won.
It hasn't even started.

615
01:09:42,538 --> 01:09:44,972
How are we going to feed
them or clothe them...

616
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:47,904
much less train them
to fight the Roman Empire?

617
01:09:48,711 --> 01:09:51,339
By teaching them to share
the burden.

618
01:09:52,081 --> 01:09:55,380
Like free men.

619
01:09:58,687 --> 01:10:02,646
Why did you propose Glabrus?
He's as thick as he is vain.

620
01:10:02,791 --> 01:10:05,259
- But politically dependable.
- Why don't put yourself forward?

621
01:10:05,394 --> 01:10:07,760
Agrippa would have blocked me
out of sheer spite.

622
01:10:07,896 --> 01:10:11,161
Besides there's little honor
in defeating slaves...

623
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:14,428
and terrible shame
if one fails.

624
01:10:14,603 --> 01:10:17,868
If Glabrus succeeds...

625
01:10:18,374 --> 01:10:21,832
a minor rebellion is put down
and he owes me a favor.

626
01:10:22,778 --> 01:10:25,303
And if he fails the whole city
will be panicked.

627
01:10:25,447 --> 01:10:27,438
And the Senate will
embrace the wisdom...

628
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:29,744
of a more permanent system
of leadership.

629
01:10:32,154 --> 01:10:34,884
Fear isn't a bad thing, Caius.

630
01:10:35,124 --> 01:10:37,957
It makes for a more
malleable electorate.

631
01:10:40,396 --> 01:10:43,797
Crassus says he wants
to be Consul...

632
01:10:43,932 --> 01:10:46,696
in order to restore the former
glory of Rome.

633
01:10:46,835 --> 01:10:49,599
But he wants to transform
the Consul...

634
01:10:49,705 --> 01:10:51,605
into a more permanent position.
Emperor.

635
01:10:52,775 --> 01:10:55,869
The day that Crassus
becomes Consul...

636
01:10:56,011 --> 01:10:58,445
is the day the
Roman Republic dies.

637
01:11:05,387 --> 01:11:07,252
The time has come to make
some decisions.

638
01:11:07,823 --> 01:11:10,257
- We must leave?
- And to where?

639
01:11:10,392 --> 01:11:13,156
- I want to go home.
- Everywhere is the same as here.

640
01:11:13,295 --> 01:11:15,490
Everywhere it is master
and slave.

641
01:11:15,631 --> 01:11:17,690
I go where I go.

642
01:11:17,833 --> 01:11:20,427
No man tells Crixus
what to do anymore.

643
01:11:20,636 --> 01:11:22,661
Come down, Crixus.

644
01:11:27,876 --> 01:11:30,276
This is Crixus the Gaul.

645
01:11:30,813 --> 01:11:32,974
Maybe the strongest man
among us.

646
01:11:34,316 --> 01:11:37,285
But still, he's only
one man.

647
01:11:39,121 --> 01:11:42,716
Can you bend this?

648
01:11:48,397 --> 01:11:50,592
Now all of these.

649
01:12:00,376 --> 01:12:02,742
We are like the arrows.

650
01:12:03,779 --> 01:12:06,441
Separately we're weak.

651
01:12:06,582 --> 01:12:10,109
But together we're invincible.

652
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,852
And that's why the Romans worked
so hard to divide us...

653
01:12:13,989 --> 01:12:16,924
tribe by tribe and
country by country.

654
01:12:18,861 --> 01:12:21,989
- We're one tribe then?
- Yes!

655
01:12:22,131 --> 01:12:24,998
- Is that your will?
- Yes!

656
01:12:25,434 --> 01:12:27,197
Who will lead us?

657
01:12:28,804 --> 01:12:31,364
Stand up if you want to lead.

658
01:12:36,879 --> 01:12:38,870
Spartacus.

659
01:12:39,381 --> 01:12:41,781
- Spartacus!
- Spartacus!

660
01:12:41,950 --> 01:12:44,441
- Spartacus!
- Spartacus!

661
01:12:49,224 --> 01:12:51,590
If that is your wish.

662
01:12:53,362 --> 01:12:56,229
And so one man doesn't
become a tyrant...

663
01:12:56,632 --> 01:12:58,725
we need laws.

664
01:12:59,334 --> 01:13:02,599
- What are they?
- Whatever we take...

665
01:13:02,704 --> 01:13:04,968
we hold together.

666
01:13:05,107 --> 01:13:07,871
No man should own anything
but his own weapon.

667
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:11,377
- We'll be rich with the gold taken.
- We'll make the Romans our slaves!

668
01:13:11,513 --> 01:13:15,847
- Yeah!
- I will not be a slave owner!

669
01:13:16,385 --> 01:13:18,580
Slavery is an evil.

670
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:20,847
An evil that turns
all men slaves...

671
01:13:20,956 --> 01:13:23,447
and slave masters into animals.

672
01:13:23,559 --> 01:13:27,120
There will be equality and justice
between both man and woman.

673
01:13:27,296 --> 01:13:29,730
- We're one tribe then?
- Yes.

674
01:13:30,098 --> 01:13:32,862
- One people?
- Yes!

675
01:13:34,002 --> 01:13:35,594
Is that your will?

676
01:13:38,941 --> 01:13:40,499
It is my will.

677
01:13:42,344 --> 01:13:45,211
- It is my will.
- It is my will.

678
01:13:47,616 --> 01:13:50,449
It is my will.

679
01:13:53,622 --> 01:13:56,090
Then this is what we'll do.

680
01:13:56,959 --> 01:13:59,860
We'll go from plantation
to plantation...

681
01:13:59,995 --> 01:14:01,895
from house to house...

682
01:14:02,030 --> 01:14:05,193
free the slaves, and fight anyone
who tries to stop us.

683
01:14:09,104 --> 01:14:11,937
And we'll make
an end to Rome...

684
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:16,136
and build a new world where
there'll be no slaves or masters!

685
01:14:34,329 --> 01:14:37,230
- What is going on up there?
- Some plantation...

686
01:14:37,366 --> 01:14:39,664
is burning the stubble
of a field.

687
01:14:39,768 --> 01:14:41,497
There's too much smoke
for that.

688
01:14:41,637 --> 01:14:44,367
There's a forest fire
or something.

689
01:14:44,506 --> 01:14:46,030
Tell them to go faster.

690
01:14:46,174 --> 01:14:48,540
- Helena!
- Faster!

691
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:01,118
Why are you stopping?
What is the meaning of this?

692
01:15:08,297 --> 01:15:10,162
Whoever you are...

693
01:15:10,299 --> 01:15:13,325
you are blocking the path
of a citizen of Rome.

694
01:15:13,936 --> 01:15:16,131
Move out of the way.

695
01:15:24,546 --> 01:15:26,571
Pick up your litters!

696
01:15:29,418 --> 01:15:31,386
Pick up your litters!

697
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:33,415
Pick up your litters!

698
01:16:03,218 --> 01:16:05,345
Glabrus wishes us to know...

699
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,284
that while he hasn't
encountered the brigands...

700
01:16:08,457 --> 01:16:11,585
evidence of their
atrocities is everywhere.

701
01:16:11,893 --> 01:16:16,728
"A slave who doesn't join
their ranks is put to the sword...

702
01:16:16,865 --> 01:16:19,766
and any Roman unfortunate
enough to encounter them...

703
01:16:19,935 --> 01:16:22,699
meets a fate worse than death.

704
01:16:22,904 --> 01:16:26,305
It's with great regret that I
report the murders...

705
01:16:26,508 --> 01:16:32,174
of numerous nobles
including Cornelius Lucius...

706
01:16:33,148 --> 01:16:35,582
and his wife Helena."

707
01:16:39,521 --> 01:16:42,354
Helena and Cornelius Lucius?

708
01:16:43,025 --> 01:16:46,586
- Are you sure?
- That is what it says.

709
01:16:47,863 --> 01:16:50,423
"The rebels' leader
is Spartacus...

710
01:16:50,565 --> 01:16:53,090
a gladiator from Thrace.

711
01:16:53,268 --> 01:16:55,668
He has led them
to Mt. Vesuvius.

712
01:16:55,871 --> 01:17:00,205
It is there that I intend
to trap and dispose of them.

713
01:17:00,342 --> 01:17:04,278
Rest assured I am mindful
that I carry in my hands...

714
01:17:04,579 --> 01:17:09,846
the glory and majesty
that is Rome.

715
01:17:10,152 --> 01:17:11,983
Titus Glabrus."

716
01:17:40,949 --> 01:17:44,908
- So we're to be equals, are we?
- Does that trouble you?

717
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:49,216
Well, I'll do what I can to raise
myself, but I make no promises.

718
01:17:49,424 --> 01:17:52,621
You better. A child needs a father
it can look up to.

719
01:17:57,733 --> 01:18:01,464
A child?
We're going to have a child?

720
01:18:22,324 --> 01:18:25,851
The slave army's climbing the north
wall of the mountain, my Lord.

721
01:18:25,961 --> 01:18:28,395
A little less liberal use of the
term 'army', if you don't mind.

722
01:18:28,563 --> 01:18:32,124
- Sorry, my Lord.
- We'll camp here for tonight.

723
01:18:34,936 --> 01:18:37,200
Why don't we push on, my Lord?

724
01:18:37,539 --> 01:18:39,734
Cut off the slaves before they
reach the mountains.

725
01:18:39,908 --> 01:18:43,639
It's cold, I'm tired and I'm
hungry. We'll camp here.

726
01:18:52,854 --> 01:18:56,790
I like it.
It's light but it's strong.

727
01:18:58,193 --> 01:19:00,559
Spartacus, we need to talk.

728
01:19:12,707 --> 01:19:14,368
This is a war council.

729
01:19:14,509 --> 01:19:17,444
- What's a woman doing here?
- She has every right to be here.

730
01:19:17,579 --> 01:19:19,911
Do women lead your armies?
Is that why Jews...

731
01:19:20,048 --> 01:19:23,415
- squirm under the Roman thumb?
- What's the excuse of the Gauls?

732
01:19:24,252 --> 01:19:26,914
David has news for us.

733
01:19:27,255 --> 01:19:29,951
Three cohorts of Roman soldiers
have taken a position...

734
01:19:30,091 --> 01:19:32,958
on the road below us.
We're trapped.

735
01:19:33,094 --> 01:19:35,119
They're so confident they haven't
even built a stockade.

736
01:19:35,263 --> 01:19:37,823
Fifteen hundred men.

737
01:19:37,966 --> 01:19:42,027
I knew this would happen,
Thracian, but you insisted.

738
01:19:42,204 --> 01:19:45,503
"The people are tired.
They need rest."

739
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:48,265
Well, the dead rest forever.

740
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:54,478
You must've known
they'd follow us here.

741
01:19:54,616 --> 01:19:57,210
How do we get off
this mountain?

742
01:19:57,319 --> 01:19:59,719
What's your plan?

743
01:20:00,722 --> 01:20:04,556
- I don't have one.
- You don't have a plan?

744
01:20:05,493 --> 01:20:07,757
From the moment I stood up
in the training yard...

745
01:20:07,896 --> 01:20:10,091
I've only thought as far ahead
as the next move.

746
01:20:10,232 --> 01:20:13,099
- You must have an idea.
- Why must I?

747
01:20:13,602 --> 01:20:15,502
I'm no different from
any of you.

748
01:20:16,071 --> 01:20:18,869
Isn't that the point?
That we're all equal?

749
01:20:19,007 --> 01:20:21,635
- Yes, but...
- So one of you figure it out!

750
01:20:28,049 --> 01:20:29,482
He'll be fine.

751
01:20:34,589 --> 01:20:37,752
- They chose you as their leader.
- I didn't ask for that honor.

752
01:20:37,926 --> 01:20:40,451
No, but you didn't
decline it either.

753
01:20:40,795 --> 01:20:44,162
And why should you?
You're the only possible choice.

754
01:20:45,867 --> 01:20:49,132
- But now the time to lead has come.
- When I was alone...

755
01:20:49,271 --> 01:20:51,569
all I had to lose was my own life.

756
01:20:52,007 --> 01:20:54,498
Now I have the lives
of hundreds.

757
01:20:55,543 --> 01:21:00,537
Your life.
Our child's.

758
01:21:04,653 --> 01:21:07,213
- I have faith you'll find answers.
- Where?

759
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:11,588
- Within the soul you say I have?
- Yes.

760
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:14,929
You may not have chosen this
moment, Spartacus.

761
01:21:15,397 --> 01:21:19,060
But it seems that this moment
has chosen you.

762
01:21:28,043 --> 01:21:31,774
My Lord, is it true you've given
the troops permission to camp...

763
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:33,973
without building the usual
defensive fortifications?

764
01:21:34,115 --> 01:21:36,743
The men are tired
and I am tired.

765
01:21:36,851 --> 01:21:39,877
When a Roman army bivouacs it is
customary to build a fort.

766
01:21:40,021 --> 01:21:42,285
It's just a handful of slaves...

767
01:21:42,424 --> 01:21:45,291
facing the same miserable
conditions we are.

768
01:21:45,427 --> 01:21:48,225
With women and children and one
tenth of our equipment.

769
01:21:57,539 --> 01:22:00,565
A little while ago some of you
were asking me if I had a plan.

770
01:22:03,011 --> 01:22:06,606
And the plan is this.
We will attack first.

771
01:22:26,968 --> 01:22:30,927
David, hold your men outside the
camp until you hear my cry...

772
01:22:31,072 --> 01:22:33,973
and then charge in like
the gods of hell.

773
01:22:36,745 --> 01:22:39,737
If these don't hold,
I'll kill you myself.

774
01:22:40,015 --> 01:22:43,849
If these don't hold, you won't have
to kill me. We'll all be dead.

775
01:23:52,854 --> 01:23:54,879
You can tell us now.

776
01:23:55,790 --> 01:23:58,384
You are safe here.

777
01:24:10,772 --> 01:24:13,172
I was asleep.

778
01:24:13,875 --> 01:24:17,606
I woke up to screaming.

779
01:24:17,912 --> 01:24:19,573
The sound of screaming.

780
01:24:20,849 --> 01:24:22,840
I was screaming.

781
01:24:23,184 --> 01:24:26,642
Their men were everywhere,
like ravenous beasts.

782
01:24:27,422 --> 01:24:30,721
And their women followed, feeding
like harpies on the wounded.

783
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:35,489
The killing went on and on.

784
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:39,527
At the end our men threw down the
weapons and plead for their lives...

785
01:24:39,667 --> 01:24:43,501
- but there was no mercy.
- How is it that you were spared?

786
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:48,608
I don't know why they chose me.

787
01:24:50,111 --> 01:24:54,070
All I know is I was brought
before their leader.

788
01:24:55,617 --> 01:24:59,883
My name is Spartacus. I have a
message for your Senate.

789
01:25:00,588 --> 01:25:03,614
Tell them that we, the slaves...

790
01:25:03,758 --> 01:25:06,386
say the Roman way
is corrupt and dead.

791
01:25:06,528 --> 01:25:10,020
We want nothing from you.
Leave us alone.

792
01:25:10,765 --> 01:25:13,700
But if you come
after us again...

793
01:25:13,868 --> 01:25:16,701
we will destroy you all.
