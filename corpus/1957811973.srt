00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,762
- [Danny] Now, that
is a classy Irish pub.

8
00:00:38,762 --> 00:00:40,799
Well, the exterior anyway.

9
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:42,594
My parents Pete and
Mary built this place

10
00:00:42,594 --> 00:00:45,597
when they came across
the pond from Ireland.

11
00:00:45,597 --> 00:00:47,047
My cousin Phil and I,

12
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,083
we used to play here
like it was a jungle gym.

13
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,810
And I actually lost my virginity
in the walk-in freezer,

14
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,295
which I don't recommend.

15
00:00:54,295 --> 00:00:56,228
This used to be a
popular spot too,

16
00:00:56,228 --> 00:00:59,507
but we hit a rough
patch after my mom died.

17
00:00:59,507 --> 00:01:01,406
Dad started drinking a lot,

18
00:01:01,406 --> 00:01:03,718
much more than the
average Irishman.

19
00:01:03,718 --> 00:01:04,857
We lost customers, and things

20
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:07,688
have never really been the same.

21
00:01:07,688 --> 00:01:09,276
And actually my dad's been
having a lot of problems

22
00:01:09,276 --> 00:01:12,175
recently, which
leads me to wonder,

23
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,903
what the hell is next.

24
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,802
- Fuck them!

25
00:01:18,802 --> 00:01:21,081
- Jesus, Pete, how
can you tend bar

26
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,600
when you're drunker than
all of us put together?

27
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,086
- What's the matter, Pete,
banks after you again?

28
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,949
- What do you know about banks?

29
00:01:27,949 --> 00:01:30,573
- Kiss my ass, you drunken mick.

you half-wit shit mopper?

36
00:01:40,721 --> 00:01:43,793
- Hey, calm down, Pete,
just take it easy!

37
00:01:43,793 --> 00:01:46,382
- They think they're
gonna take this place?

38
00:01:46,382 --> 00:01:47,452
- Pete!

39
00:01:47,452 --> 00:01:50,110
- Fuck 'em, I'll show them.

40
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,836

[engine revving]

00:02:11,372 --> 00:02:13,305
- You gonna take my bar, huh?

45
00:02:13,305 --> 00:02:15,514
- [ATM] Would you like
to make a deposit today?

46
00:02:15,514 --> 00:02:19,277
- Oh, I'll deposit Sally
up your fucking ass!

47
00:02:21,037 --> 00:02:25,041

- What are you doing?

54
00:02:47,926 --> 00:02:49,307
- What's up, cuz?

55
00:02:49,307 --> 00:02:51,447
Little CB, little
cocktail break.

56
00:02:51,447 --> 00:02:52,551
- Well it's getting
busy back there,

57
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:53,794
and Vince is asking about you.

58
00:02:53,794 --> 00:02:55,071
Did you get that
pizza to Emory yet?

59
00:02:55,071 --> 00:02:57,177
- No worries, next
on my checklist.

60
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,454
- So you have a list.

61
00:02:58,454 --> 00:03:01,836
- Yeah, it's right, see,
it's CB and then Emory.

62
00:03:01,836 --> 00:03:03,148
- Okay great, well, it's
been like two hours,

63
00:03:03,148 --> 00:03:04,356
so you might wanna step on it.

64
00:03:04,356 --> 00:03:05,978
- Whatever, you
should deliver it.

65
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:07,463
Okay, you owe me from last week.

66
00:03:07,463 --> 00:03:09,154
- Oh, yeah, oh, oh, right.

67
00:03:09,154 --> 00:03:11,294
Right, you live in my
basement and I owe you.

68
00:03:11,294 --> 00:03:12,847
- Why do you always
have to bring that up?

69
00:03:12,847 --> 00:03:15,505
That has nothing to do with
what we're dealing with.

70
00:03:15,505 --> 00:03:18,198
- What did you pay me
last month in rent?

71
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,924
You gave me a Boyz II
Men greatest hits CD,

72
00:03:20,924 --> 00:03:22,478
you know, which I liked,

73
00:03:22,478 --> 00:03:24,928
but just, please, why don't
you go and deliver those pies

74
00:03:24,928 --> 00:03:27,655
so Vince doesn't go crazy on us.

75
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:28,587
- Whatever.

76
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:32,626

00:03:43,292 --> 00:03:45,121
- Shit, yeah.

79
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:47,537
- Hey, Danny, it's
Gabe Greenberg.

80
00:03:47,537 --> 00:03:49,574
I've gotta talk to
you about your father.

81
00:03:49,574 --> 00:03:51,472
He's gotten himself
into a real jam,

82
00:03:51,472 --> 00:03:53,819
and I'm not sure I can get
him out of it this time.

83
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:55,062
- What did he do?

84
00:03:55,062 --> 00:03:57,927
- Let's see, he
got drunk, shocker.

85
00:03:57,927 --> 00:03:59,204
And then of course he drove,

86
00:03:59,204 --> 00:04:02,138
and he drunkenly
attacked an ATM.

87
00:04:02,138 --> 00:04:05,831
- [groans] Okay,
holy shit, bail?

88
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:07,488
- No, I think we're
looking at some time.

89
00:04:07,488 --> 00:04:09,249
I mean, he doesn't have
a dime in the bank,

90
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,217
and unless you start delivering
cocaine instead of pizza,

91
00:04:12,217 --> 00:04:14,254
you ain't gonna be
able to help him out.

92
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:18,258
Although pot and pizza's
a pretty good idea.

93
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,466
He wants to talk to you

94
00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:21,261
so let's meet at
the jail at 2:30,

95
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,435
and we'll figure it
all out then, okay?

96
00:04:23,435 --> 00:04:25,472
- [Danny] Okay,
I'll see you there.

97
00:04:25,472 --> 00:04:27,094
- All right, buddy.

98
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,005
- I ordered that pizza,
like, 2 1/2 hours ago.

99
00:04:42,005 --> 00:04:43,317
- Oh, yeah, sorry
about that, man.

100
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:44,974
I had to take this massive shit,

101
00:04:44,974 --> 00:04:46,251
and I couldn't find a restroom,

102
00:04:46,251 --> 00:04:49,910
so I was like driving
around, it was crazy.

103
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,118
[dramatic music]

104
00:04:51,118 --> 00:04:53,534
- There's a fuckin'
piece missing.

105
00:04:53,534 --> 00:04:55,018
- I don't make 'em,
I just deliver 'em.

106

Sometimes they organize
it differently.

107
00:04:55,985 --> 00:04:57,642
- You ate my pizza.

108
00:04:57,642 --> 00:04:59,609
- Okay, hold on, 11.50.

109
00:04:59,609 --> 00:05:01,715
- No, I ain't paying shit.

110
00:05:03,026 --> 00:05:05,270
- Oh, you're paying for it.

111
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:09,688
[shouting]

112
00:05:09,688 --> 00:05:10,517
- Shit.

113
00:05:11,552 --> 00:05:12,450
- Motherfucker!

114
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,416
- You're gonna pay, man.

115
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,418
You're gonna pay, man.

116
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:18,110
- Hey, what the hell's going on?

117
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:21,666
- This deadbeat
motherfucker won't pay.

118
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,150
- He ate my pizza.

119
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,117
- We'll get you a
new pizza, all right?

120
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:26,740
- Yeah, we'll see about that.

121
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,568
- We'll see right now.

122
00:05:27,568 --> 00:05:28,397
- Yeah.

123
00:05:28,397 --> 00:05:30,847
[Phil yells]

124
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:36,957
- You fired.

125
00:05:36,957 --> 00:05:37,785
- What?

126
00:05:37,785 --> 00:05:39,097
No, no, Vince, hold on.

127
00:05:39,097 --> 00:05:40,305
Let's just back up a second.

128
00:05:40,305 --> 00:05:41,237
We can talk about this.

129
00:05:41,237 --> 00:05:42,687
We've been here before man.

130
00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:46,276
- You drunk dummy, no more
drink beer, no more eat pizza.

131
00:05:46,276 --> 00:05:47,381
Bullshit.

132
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:48,382
Get out.

133
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:49,521
- I'm bullshit?

134
00:05:49,521 --> 00:05:51,143
You're bullshit, motherfucker.

135
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:53,594
You're Chinese and
you're tossing pizzas.

136
00:05:53,594 --> 00:05:55,803
Why don't you get
behind a little stir-fry

137
00:05:55,803 --> 00:05:57,598
and cook me up a
little Kung Pao Phooey.

138
00:05:57,598 --> 00:05:58,530
All right?

139
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,221
You fuckin' wannabe Guido-ass.

140
00:06:00,221 --> 00:06:01,153
- You fired!

141
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,605
You both fired.

142
00:06:04,605 --> 00:06:05,434
- Whoa.

143
00:06:05,434 --> 00:06:07,090
- Get out of my store!

[swears in foreign language]

145
00:06:08,022 --> 00:06:09,058
You ain't seen nothing.

146
00:06:09,058 --> 00:06:10,611
Get out of my store!

147
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:11,923
Hey!

148
00:06:11,923 --> 00:06:14,201
[shouting]

149
00:06:21,104 --> 00:06:22,796
- Hey, Pete.

150
00:06:22,796 --> 00:06:23,900
- Uncle Pete.

151
00:06:26,696 --> 00:06:27,525
- Dad.

152
00:06:29,768 --> 00:06:32,392
- What's the damage, Rabbi?

153
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,567
- The best the D.A. will
offer us is 60 days in here

154
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:40,089
or 31 days in a state-sponsored
rehabilitation clinic.

155
00:06:42,022 --> 00:06:42,850
- What?

156
00:06:44,058 --> 00:06:48,062
I thought you Jews were
supposed to be smart.

157
00:06:48,062 --> 00:06:51,031
- Well, we did split the atom
and perfect the Ponzi scheme,

158
00:06:51,031 --> 00:06:54,414
but the Asians have co-opted
the smart stereotype.

159
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,313
And the small-penis
one, thank God.

160
00:06:57,313 --> 00:06:58,866
- I hear rehab is a breeze.

161
00:06:58,866 --> 00:07:00,247
- I heard it's
actually kind of fun.

162
00:07:00,247 --> 00:07:02,283
Big rubber balls and
cookies and punch.

163
00:07:02,283 --> 00:07:04,424
- Shut up, you two.

164
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,944
I didn't bring you
here for moral support.

165
00:07:09,118 --> 00:07:13,433
You two will have to run
the bar while I'm in.

166
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,710
- Wait, what are
you talking about?

167
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,609
- I've got the house
down as collateral,

168
00:07:17,609 --> 00:07:20,681
and if I don't make a
$10,000 payment on the 1st,

169
00:07:20,681 --> 00:07:24,582
they're taking the bar,
they're taking the house,

170
00:07:24,582 --> 00:07:28,344
and you two will be out on
your asses where you belong.

171
00:07:28,344 --> 00:07:29,863
- Don't give me shit.

172
00:07:29,863 --> 00:07:31,554
It's not my fault that you ran
everyone out of your own bar.

173
00:07:31,554 --> 00:07:33,453
- Who do you think
you're talking to?

174
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,419
- Okay, time to go.

175
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:36,697
- Don't you lose that bar!

176
00:07:36,697 --> 00:07:39,113
Do not lose that fuckin' bar!

177
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,498
- Can they really
take everything?

178
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:45,982
- Yeah.

179
00:07:45,982 --> 00:07:48,295
The old man took a second
mortgage on the house,

180
00:07:48,295 --> 00:07:50,193
which I had appraised
at five times its value,

181
00:07:50,193 --> 00:07:51,712
thank you very much.

182
00:07:51,712 --> 00:07:53,576
- All right, well,
tell me this, Gabe.

183
00:07:53,576 --> 00:07:55,820
How much does the bar make?

184
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,062
- I think the better
question would be,

185
00:07:57,062 --> 00:07:59,686
how much does the bar lose?

186
00:07:59,686 --> 00:08:01,481
Danny, you need to go down there

187
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,173
and help out your old
man for a little while,

188
00:08:04,173 --> 00:08:07,487
but you boys also need to
find another place to live.

189
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,489
I'll help you out any way I can.

190
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,214
Just give me the word.

191
00:08:11,214 --> 00:08:12,353
- I can't pay rent.

192
00:08:12,353 --> 00:08:13,941
- Except for money.

193
00:08:13,941 --> 00:08:16,426
You know the thing
about Jews being cheap.

194
00:08:16,426 --> 00:08:17,255
Sorry.

195
00:08:17,255 --> 00:08:18,498
- Yeah.

196
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,706
- You got shit all
over your shirt.

197
00:08:19,706 --> 00:08:21,846
- I'll wash it up,
I'll wash it up.

198
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:25,746
So what is up with
the wig on that guy?

199
00:08:25,746 --> 00:08:27,196
- I don't,

200
00:08:27,196 --> 00:08:28,818
I feel like I was just punched
in the fucking stomach.

201
00:08:28,818 --> 00:08:31,234
- Okay, so what do we do now?

202
00:08:35,376 --> 00:08:36,308
- Hey, come on.

203
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,379
Stop wasting it, will you?

204
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:41,313
- It's so good.

205
00:08:43,005 --> 00:08:44,282
What do you got?

206
00:08:44,282 --> 00:08:45,766
- Shanahan's Whiskey
is having a contest.

207
00:08:45,766 --> 00:08:48,528
You write an essay, and you
can win a bar in Ireland.

208
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,633
- Hey, you took a semester
of comp at Nassau Community.

209
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:52,911
Why don't you give it a
shot, do a little essay?

210
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:54,326
- Your sarcasm right now?

211
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:55,707
Not really feeling it.

212
00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:56,536
So you're cut off.

213
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,709
- I was kind of serious.

214
00:08:57,709 --> 00:08:58,607
I think you'd be good at it.

215
00:08:58,607 --> 00:09:00,125
Okay, I'm kidding.

216
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,195
I'm sorry.

217
00:09:01,195 --> 00:09:02,714
Give it back.

218
00:09:02,714 --> 00:09:04,060
Okay, thank you.

219
00:09:06,442 --> 00:09:07,823
- Hey, sweetie.

220
00:09:07,823 --> 00:09:11,033
- Oh, I thought I felt
my balls being tied off.

221
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:13,242
- I got my mom the
greatest birthday gift.

222
00:09:13,242 --> 00:09:14,070
- What did you get?

223
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,244
- A new daughter?

224
00:09:15,244 --> 00:09:16,694
- Shut up, Phil.

225
00:09:16,694 --> 00:09:18,523
Why don't you go in the
back and play with yourself?

226
00:09:18,523 --> 00:09:19,559
- No, he won't let me--

227
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,077
- That's a no-go around here.

228
00:09:21,077 --> 00:09:23,079
When we were 12, Phil got
caught in the bathroom.

229
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:25,426
- I don't do that anymore.

230
00:09:25,426 --> 00:09:26,358
- So what did you get?

231
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,395
- A pair of gold chopsticks.

232
00:09:28,395 --> 00:09:29,707
- No!

233
00:09:29,707 --> 00:09:31,191
This is great.

234
00:09:31,191 --> 00:09:33,227
- You know, she's getting
into sushi and yoga and stuff.

235
00:09:33,227 --> 00:09:34,850
- Sushi and yoga is
so hot right now.

236
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:35,678
This is perfect.

237
00:09:35,678 --> 00:09:37,162
She's gonna love this.

238
00:09:37,162 --> 00:09:39,682
- So don't forget, dinner
at seven on Thursday.

239
00:09:39,682 --> 00:09:41,926
- Oh, well, honey, I can't.

240
00:09:41,926 --> 00:09:43,375
I have to run the bar.

241
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:44,756
- Danny, I told you
about this two weeks ago.

242
00:09:44,756 --> 00:09:46,447
- I know, but you got
my message, right?

243
00:09:46,447 --> 00:09:48,588
- I've been buttering up my
dad about giving you this job,

244
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,037
and I was counting
on my mom's birthday

245
00:09:50,037 --> 00:09:51,694
to put him over the edge.

246
00:09:51,694 --> 00:09:52,937
- Really?

247
00:09:52,937 --> 00:09:55,146
- What job were you
buttering him up for?

248
00:09:55,146 --> 00:09:55,974
- It's nothing.

249
00:09:55,974 --> 00:09:57,389
Just, you know--

250
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,495
- Working for my father's
insurance company.

251
00:09:59,495 --> 00:10:01,048
- Insurance?

252
00:10:01,048 --> 00:10:03,741
Danny, dream come true.

253
00:10:03,741 --> 00:10:04,673
- Fuck you, Phil.

254
00:10:04,673 --> 00:10:05,915
Everybody needs insurance.

255
00:10:05,915 --> 00:10:07,399
- Everybody also needs
their prostate checked,

256
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,679
but I don't see Danny
lining up for that job.

257
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:14,337
- Hey, listen, you
know that I want to.

258
00:10:14,337 --> 00:10:15,649
I would love to be
there, but I can't.

259
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:18,583
I have to fuckin'
take care of the bar.

260
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:19,619
- Whatever, Danny.

261
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,206
- No, hey, hey, hey, hey.

262
00:10:21,206 --> 00:10:24,313
Listen, so business has been
really bad down here recently

263
00:10:24,313 --> 00:10:26,833
and you are just
cute as a button,

264
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,973
and I was wondering if you
wanted to cocktail or bartend.

265
00:10:28,973 --> 00:10:31,285
Some female energy might
completely arouse some business.

266
00:10:31,285 --> 00:10:32,977
It'd be good for the place.

267
00:10:32,977 --> 00:10:35,082
- So you want me to come down
here and wear a short dress

268
00:10:35,082 --> 00:10:37,395
and maybe even show a
little bit of cleavage.

269
00:10:37,395 --> 00:10:39,086
- Yeah, I think that
would be perfect.

270
00:10:39,086 --> 00:10:40,709
- What do you think I am?

271
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:42,469
If you want a tap-dancing whore,

272
00:10:42,469 --> 00:10:44,091
get Phil's girlfriend to do it.

273
00:10:44,091 --> 00:10:46,369
- There's no tap dancing
in the donkey show.

274
00:10:46,369 --> 00:10:48,613
- You are such an asshole.

275
00:10:48,613 --> 00:10:50,822
- First, I was kidding.

276
00:10:50,822 --> 00:10:55,413
- Lindz, we should try it
first before we get all mad.

277
00:10:55,413 --> 00:10:56,690
- Fuck this place, man.

278
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:57,657
This place has been
nothing but trouble

279
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,175
my whole fucking life.

280
00:10:59,175 --> 00:11:00,142
- Yeah.

281
00:11:00,142 --> 00:11:02,144
Oh, man, this place sucks.

282
00:11:02,144 --> 00:11:05,216
I wish I was in the glamorous
insurance industry right now.

283
00:11:05,216 --> 00:11:08,564
- Phil, you know that is
my only ticket out of here.

284
00:11:08,564 --> 00:11:09,738
I have nothing.

285
00:11:09,738 --> 00:11:12,050
I have no degree,
and I have no skills.

286
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,259
- Lindz, with a fuckin' z.

287
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:15,191
She has a z in her name.

288
00:11:15,191 --> 00:11:16,814
What, she starting junior high?

289
00:11:16,814 --> 00:11:18,160
- She's looking out
for me, all right?

290
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,541
And she's my girlfriend,
and she loves me.

291
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,820
So I'd appreciate
if you'd stop being

292
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,028
such an asshole to her.

293
00:11:24,028 --> 00:11:24,960
Can you do that?

294
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,754
- If that's what you want.

295
00:11:25,754 --> 00:11:26,513
- It's what I want.

296
00:11:26,513 --> 00:11:27,341
- Okay.

297
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:35,315
- Oh, God, that feels so good.

298
00:11:35,315 --> 00:11:37,489
[moaning]

299
00:11:38,387 --> 00:11:40,630
[laughing]

300
00:11:42,322 --> 00:11:43,150
- Do you like that?

301
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,427
- Yes, I do.

302
00:11:44,427 --> 00:11:46,395
I like it very much.

303
00:11:46,395 --> 00:11:47,223
Go back.

304
00:11:47,223 --> 00:11:48,362
Okay, go back.

305
00:11:53,851 --> 00:11:54,679
Yeah.

306
00:11:55,991 --> 00:11:58,131
[moaning]

307
00:12:03,826 --> 00:12:05,932
- Where are the diamonds?

308
00:12:06,795 --> 00:12:07,657
- God!

309
00:12:07,657 --> 00:12:08,658
You asshole!

310
00:12:10,143 --> 00:12:11,385
- You--
- Shit.

311
00:12:12,835 --> 00:12:16,528
I too can play rough
at this, Miss Sinclair.

312
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,738
- Yeah.

313
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,947
Well, you can play
rough by yourself.

314
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:24,778
Fuck you, I'm not
kidding about this.

315
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:28,920
- I thought it would be fun
with the whippy and, babe.

316
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,335
Whoa, whoa, whoa, baby.

317
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,751
I'm so sorry.

318
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,064
That was not fun and I
thought it was gonna be fun.

319
00:12:35,064 --> 00:12:36,376
That was weird.

320
00:12:36,376 --> 00:12:38,136
- It's just my act at work.

321
00:12:38,136 --> 00:12:40,725
It is not what I'm into.

322
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:44,211
- Okay, so Janine is
not Princess Natasha.

323
00:12:45,868 --> 00:12:46,731
- Get down.

324
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:48,629
Yeah, like that, bitch?

325
00:12:50,148 --> 00:12:52,150
Not unless you have 30 bucks.

326
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,290
- I do not have $30.

327
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:58,087
- Well, I guess you're
just stuck with Janine.

328
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:02,782
- Which is actually great for
me, because Princess Natasha

329
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,680
actually scares
the shit out of me.

330
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,508
Just a little bit.

331
00:13:05,508 --> 00:13:07,614
Yeah, yeah, I know.

332
00:13:07,614 --> 00:13:08,753
I was trying to get used to it.

333
00:13:08,753 --> 00:13:09,581
I'm sorry.

334
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,238
- You know?

335
00:13:11,238 --> 00:13:12,515
- What?

336
00:13:12,515 --> 00:13:14,690
- If we moved in together,

337
00:13:17,037 --> 00:13:19,799
we could do this
every single night.

338
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,904
- Okay, we're gonna talk,

339
00:13:23,388 --> 00:13:24,389
we're gonna do that now?

340
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:25,666
We're gonna talk.

341
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,048
'Cause I thought we'd
maybe wait, you know--

342
00:13:28,048 --> 00:13:30,085
- I think it's a great idea.

343
00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:31,017
- Yeah.

344
00:13:31,017 --> 00:13:33,364
- Why do we need to wait?

345
00:13:33,364 --> 00:13:35,331
- That is a fun, fun idea.

346
00:13:35,331 --> 00:13:37,713
It's just that I was
under the impression

347
00:13:37,713 --> 00:13:40,716
we were gonna take it slow,
'cause it's a big step.

348
00:13:40,716 --> 00:13:42,097
- It's been two years.

349
00:13:42,097 --> 00:13:43,408
You're 28.

350
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:44,962
Don't you think that
maybe it's time for you

351
00:13:44,962 --> 00:13:47,447
to move out of the basement?

352
00:13:47,447 --> 00:13:50,036
- I enjoy my
lifestyle, pardon me.

353
00:13:50,036 --> 00:13:52,314
Okay, I think it looks
very rustic and urban.

354
00:13:52,314 --> 00:13:53,625
Why do we have to talk
about this right now?

355
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,007
- Because I am starting to worry

356
00:13:56,007 --> 00:13:58,665
that maybe I'm just
wasting my time.

357
00:13:58,665 --> 00:14:02,496
God, you act like such
a child sometimes.

358
00:14:02,496 --> 00:14:04,533
- I'm sorry maybe this
child needs to be spanked.

359
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:07,053
Just on the bun cheeks.

360
00:14:07,053 --> 00:14:08,433
Spank it.

361
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:10,435
Just a little slap.

362
00:14:10,435 --> 00:14:11,264
Ooh, waah.

363
00:14:13,507 --> 00:14:14,336
No?

364
00:14:16,338 --> 00:14:18,547
- Do you even love me?

365
00:14:18,547 --> 00:14:19,444
[toilet flushing]

366
00:14:19,444 --> 00:14:20,273
It's not--

367
00:14:21,239 --> 00:14:22,551
[knocking]

368
00:14:22,551 --> 00:14:24,070
- What the hell is that?

369
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,728
Damn it, Phil, you forgot
to flush the toilet again.

370
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,182
[gun firing]

371
00:14:34,218 --> 00:14:35,046
- What's up?

372
00:14:35,046 --> 00:14:36,289
What's up, son?

373
00:14:37,635 --> 00:14:38,463
- So,

374
00:14:40,396 --> 00:14:41,811
did you tell Janine to
bring some strippers

375
00:14:41,811 --> 00:14:43,054
from the club tonight?

376
00:14:43,054 --> 00:14:46,057
- I did and it's just
that Janine's friends

377
00:14:46,057 --> 00:14:47,472
don't love dudes around them

378
00:14:47,472 --> 00:14:50,682
unless they're shoving twenties
in their undergarments.

379
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:51,511
You know what?

380
00:14:51,511 --> 00:14:52,374
It's gonna be fine.

381
00:14:52,374 --> 00:14:53,202
- Okay.

382
00:14:53,202 --> 00:14:54,031
All right.

383
00:14:54,031 --> 00:14:54,894
It has to be fine.

384
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,723
We've got to do this.

385
00:14:56,723 --> 00:14:58,138
- We're doing it.

386
00:14:58,138 --> 00:15:00,658
- And tonight we're
working and not drinking.

387
00:15:00,658 --> 00:15:02,108
- I got that down.

388
00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:04,006
I got that on my
checklist, work.

389
00:15:04,006 --> 00:15:05,180
- Okay.

390
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,043
All right, I'll see you at work.

391
00:15:06,043 --> 00:15:06,906
- Okay, see you then.

392
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:07,734
Okay.

393
00:15:11,427 --> 00:15:12,256
Fuck.

394
00:15:16,363 --> 00:15:17,192
All right.

395
00:15:19,504 --> 00:15:21,334
[grunting]

396
00:15:21,334 --> 00:15:23,370
[moaning]

397
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,028
[phone ringing]

398
00:15:29,135 --> 00:15:29,963
- Hello.

399
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:30,930
Shit!

400
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,827
[woman screaming]

401
00:15:31,827 --> 00:15:32,655
Oh, God!

402
00:15:32,655 --> 00:15:33,484
Oh, yeah!

403
00:15:35,244 --> 00:15:36,073
- Hello.

404
00:15:36,073 --> 00:15:36,936
- Hey, man.

405
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,867
Was that your mom?

406
00:15:37,867 --> 00:15:39,869
No, it was the news, man.

407
00:15:39,869 --> 00:15:41,250
- Oh, the news, cool, man.

408
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,942
What are the hot topics today?

409
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,667
- I don't know, war and shit.

410
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:46,152
What's up?

411
00:15:46,152 --> 00:15:47,947
- Listen, Danny's pop's having
a little financial trouble.

412
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,914
We could really use some
business at O.D.'s tonight.

413
00:15:49,914 --> 00:15:52,192
If you guys can make it,
that'd be fuckin' awesome.

414
00:15:52,192 --> 00:15:53,676
- I think we're supposed
to go down to The Stone

415
00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:56,438
or something but, yeah, we
can try to make it down there.

416
00:15:56,438 --> 00:15:57,577
- Fuck The Stone, okay?

417
00:15:57,577 --> 00:15:58,405
Come to O.D.'s.

418
00:15:58,405 --> 00:16:00,269
Do us a favor.

419
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:02,133
- Yeah, Phil, all right.

420
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:03,376
It's cool.

421
00:16:03,376 --> 00:16:06,103
- And, lay off that
shit, all right?

422
00:16:06,103 --> 00:16:07,000
It'll make you go blind.

423
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,208
- It was the news, man.

424
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:11,108
- [snorts] Stupid.

425
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:15,250
- Hey, man, can I get a smoke?

426
00:16:16,561 --> 00:16:17,977
Oops!

427
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,221
- It looks like you jokers
aren't very popular.

428
00:16:21,221 --> 00:16:22,153
- Where is everybody?

429
00:16:22,153 --> 00:16:24,155
I thought you called people.

430
00:16:24,155 --> 00:16:25,363
- I did call people.

431
00:16:25,363 --> 00:16:27,227
I called everyone.

432
00:16:27,227 --> 00:16:28,711
- Oh, this place is hopping.

433
00:16:28,711 --> 00:16:30,610
I don't know if I can
make it to the bar.

434
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,992
Next time I'm gonna call
and make a reservation.

435
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,579
[laughing]

436
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:35,511
Where are the bartenders?

437
00:16:35,511 --> 00:16:36,547
I can't find them anywhere.

438
00:16:36,547 --> 00:16:38,169
It's so crowded.

439
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:39,964
They're really busy.

440
00:16:39,964 --> 00:16:41,586
- Hello, welcome.

441
00:16:41,586 --> 00:16:43,692
Where the fuck is everybody?

442
00:16:43,692 --> 00:16:45,659
- I don't know.

443
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:47,558
[laughing] At a good bar?

444
00:16:47,558 --> 00:16:49,767
I came straight over
from the precinct.

445
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:51,976
- Here you go, buddy boy, 12.50.

446
00:16:51,976 --> 00:16:54,358
- Oh, how do you
know what I want?

447
00:16:54,358 --> 00:16:55,738
- Since when are you so picky?

448
00:16:55,738 --> 00:16:57,188
- Since I stopped
banging your mom.

449
00:16:57,188 --> 00:16:58,362
- Oh, really?

450
00:16:58,362 --> 00:16:59,673
'Cause she's super
into fisting dudes now.

451
00:16:59,673 --> 00:17:00,778
How's that going?

452
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:01,710
- Okay.

453
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,125
Shut the fuck up, will you?

454
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,402
Don't you guys see we
have a problem here?

455
00:17:04,402 --> 00:17:06,646
There's nobody in
this fuckin' bar.

456
00:17:06,646 --> 00:17:09,476
They're probably all
down at The Stone.

457
00:17:09,476 --> 00:17:13,066
Deadline Friday's playing, and
the JaaÃ¤ger girls are there.

458
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:14,585
- Real JaaÃ¤ger girls?

459
00:17:14,585 --> 00:17:15,413
- Yeah.

460
00:17:15,413 --> 00:17:16,345
- Oh.

461
00:17:16,345 --> 00:17:17,450
- Hey, hey, we're working here.

462
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,796
- Yeah, workin'.

463
00:17:20,901 --> 00:17:22,869
Hey, okay, you know what?

464
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:25,527
Why don't me and Mike, why
don't we go down to The Stone,

465
00:17:25,527 --> 00:17:29,979
grab those dipshits and
bring them back here?

466
00:17:29,979 --> 00:17:31,740
- Yeah, yeah, that's great.

467
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,053
Go there, grab them,
bring them right back.

468
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,055
- Yes.
- Quickly.

469
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,401
- Like bunny rabbits.

470
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:39,058
- What, like a what?

471
00:17:43,614 --> 00:17:45,857
[laughing]

472
00:17:56,834 --> 00:17:57,662
- Oh, my God.

473
00:17:57,662 --> 00:17:58,905
- Oh, my God.

474
00:17:58,905 --> 00:18:00,113
Okay, yeah, yeah, so I'm
on top of her, right?

475
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:01,597
The midget's still
on my fuckin' back,

476
00:18:01,597 --> 00:18:03,565
and I got this bat and
I'm trying to hit it off.

477
00:18:03,565 --> 00:18:05,808
And her mom walks in--

478
00:18:05,808 --> 00:18:07,707
- What the fuck is this?

479
00:18:07,707 --> 00:18:09,226
- I told you guys
we should leave.

480
00:18:09,226 --> 00:18:11,676
- Hey, Danny, we were just
on our way over there.

481
00:18:11,676 --> 00:18:14,403
- Here are your beers, guys.

482
00:18:14,403 --> 00:18:16,578
- Right after these beers.

483
00:18:16,578 --> 00:18:18,442
- You guys can't do
me this one favor?

484
00:18:18,442 --> 00:18:19,995
One time I ask for a favor.

485
00:18:19,995 --> 00:18:21,203
- Danny, relax.

486
00:18:21,203 --> 00:18:22,825
We're having a good time
with present company.

487
00:18:22,825 --> 00:18:26,105
We'll try and make it
down a little later.

488
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,072
- This is fuckin' bullshit.

489
00:18:28,072 --> 00:18:28,900
- You know what?

490
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,109
I just got an idea.

491
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,627
How about we go down to
O.D.'s tomorrow night,

492
00:18:31,627 --> 00:18:35,148
and we'll commandeer the
place like it was old times.

493
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:37,288
- You guys promise
that you are gonna come

494
00:18:37,288 --> 00:18:38,289
to the bar tomorrow night?

495
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:39,221
- Yeah.

496
00:18:39,221 --> 00:18:40,084
Just get ready.

497
00:18:40,084 --> 00:18:40,912
Could get ugly.

498
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:41,775
- The uglier the better.

499
00:18:41,775 --> 00:18:42,845
Okay.

500
00:18:42,845 --> 00:18:44,192
Good.

501
00:18:44,192 --> 00:18:47,471
All right, Phil,
you're coming with me.

502
00:18:48,713 --> 00:18:49,542
Phil.

503
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,613
- Motherfucker!

504
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,620
- How did the customer hunt go?

505
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,690
- We're gonna have a busy
night tomorrow night.

506
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:00,518
Thanks for watching the place.

507
00:19:00,518 --> 00:19:02,244
- All right, you got it.

508
00:19:02,244 --> 00:19:03,383
- I'm pretty sure that
chick got me in the eye

509
00:19:03,383 --> 00:19:05,074
with her acrylic.

510
00:19:05,074 --> 00:19:06,593
- Hey, is it red?

511
00:19:06,593 --> 00:19:07,525
- Red?

512
00:19:07,525 --> 00:19:09,044
What the hell happened to you?

513
00:19:09,044 --> 00:19:11,391
- Phil only told the JaaÃ¤ger
girl that he had a 12 inch cock,

514
00:19:11,391 --> 00:19:13,531
so she slapped him.

515
00:19:13,531 --> 00:19:14,946
- Do you?

516
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:15,982
- Well, it's not 12.

517
00:19:15,982 --> 00:19:17,225
- Oh, come on.

518
00:19:17,225 --> 00:19:19,468
You have a fuckin'
dick of a hamster.

519
00:19:19,468 --> 00:19:20,918
- It's a little bigger
than that, thank you.

520
00:19:20,918 --> 00:19:21,815
- Why'd you say it?

521
00:19:21,815 --> 00:19:23,334
- For the 5%, man.

522
00:19:23,334 --> 00:19:24,784
- What 5%?

523
00:19:24,784 --> 00:19:26,751
- You don't know about the 5%?

524
00:19:26,751 --> 00:19:27,925
Okay, here we go.

525
00:19:27,925 --> 00:19:30,893
Step one, by approaching
a nice young lady

526
00:19:30,893 --> 00:19:33,137
and announcing
your 12 inch cock,

527
00:19:33,137 --> 00:19:35,174
you can immediately
categorize these women.

528
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:39,074
95% of them will be angry,
disgusted, even violent.

529
00:19:39,074 --> 00:19:43,423
Once the weeding out is done,
you've got the crucial 5%.

530
00:19:43,423 --> 00:19:47,116
Now, once you've lured
them in with the bait,

531
00:19:47,116 --> 00:19:48,187
you're on your way home.

532
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,636
You're probably getting laid.

533
00:19:49,636 --> 00:19:52,467
Now I found that only
one in 15 of the 5%

534
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:54,469
will walk out once
they see you've lied.

535
00:19:54,469 --> 00:19:56,643
The other 14 realize I'm young,

536
00:19:56,643 --> 00:20:00,233
I'm healthy, decent-size
wiener, naked, naked.

537
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:01,303
Let nature take its course.

538
00:20:01,303 --> 00:20:02,718
It's awesome.

539
00:20:02,718 --> 00:20:04,375
- That is brilliant.

540
00:20:05,652 --> 00:20:07,654
- As the great Robert
Browning once said,

541
00:20:07,654 --> 00:20:11,175
take away random pussy
and our earth is a tomb.

542
00:20:11,175 --> 00:20:12,590
- Did he really say that?

543
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,559
- Well, I think he actually
said, take away love.

544
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:17,181
- What do you think
of that, Harold?

545
00:20:17,181 --> 00:20:18,355
- I think it's a great idea.

546
00:20:18,355 --> 00:20:19,839
- We've got to start
doing this now.

547
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,840
- Yeah.

548
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,255
I mean, with the
women 40 and 50,

549
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:24,602
we tell them we've
got a 12 inch schlong.

550
00:20:24,602 --> 00:20:26,466
They haven't been
laid in years anyway.

551
00:20:26,466 --> 00:20:27,295
They're gonna go crazy with it.

552
00:20:27,295 --> 00:20:28,813
And the old gals,

553
00:20:28,813 --> 00:20:30,539
they are just damn grateful
to get anything they can.

554
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:31,782
- All right, hey there Plato,

555
00:20:31,782 --> 00:20:33,197
why don't you take
your jumbo cock

556
00:20:33,197 --> 00:20:35,026
and go move some
boxes in the back.

557
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:36,649
- Aye, aye, Captain.

558
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:44,001
[phone ringing]

559
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:48,592
- Hello.

560
00:20:48,592 --> 00:20:50,490
- Danny boy, how are you?

561
00:20:52,112 --> 00:20:53,010
- I'm good.

562
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,149
I'm good, I'm good, Pop.

563
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:55,115
How's rehab?

564
00:20:55,115 --> 00:20:57,911
- Not too bad, not too bad.

565
00:20:57,911 --> 00:21:00,259
How's the bar doing?

566
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,019
- Mr. O'Donnell,
remember the rules.

567
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:04,539
No discussing
alcohol on the phone.

568
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:08,128
- I mean, I gave you
that new car to drive.

569
00:21:09,578 --> 00:21:11,235
How's traffic?

570
00:21:11,235 --> 00:21:12,167
- Is everything okay?

571
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:13,168
Are you on medication right now?

572
00:21:13,168 --> 00:21:14,721
Because you're not making sense.

573
00:21:14,721 --> 00:21:16,378
- No, how's traffic?

574
00:21:17,828 --> 00:21:19,485
Is it busy or empty?

575
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:23,074
- Okay, I got you.

576
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:24,041
Okay.

577
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,285
It's been about the same, dad.

578
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,425
- Well, maybe you should
work a little harder

579
00:21:28,425 --> 00:21:31,082
and getting your
friends on the road.

580
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:34,085
- Okay, well, I'm trying as
hard as I possibly can, dad so--

581
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:35,915
- You've got to keep
those roads full

582
00:21:35,915 --> 00:21:37,468
if we want to keep the car.

583
00:21:37,468 --> 00:21:40,160
- Well, you're the one that
ran everyone off the road

584
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,092
a long time ago.

585
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:42,611
- Listen, wise-ass!

586
00:21:42,611 --> 00:21:44,095
If I get out of this dump

587
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:45,787
and I don't have a
place to hang my hat,

588
00:21:45,787 --> 00:21:47,685
there's only gonna be
one person to blame,

589
00:21:47,685 --> 00:21:50,550
you and that shit-heel
cousin of yours!

590
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,827
- Well, that's two people.

591
00:21:51,827 --> 00:21:54,174
- That bar's all I got
left in this world,

592
00:21:54,174 --> 00:21:56,867
and you better
not lose it on me!

593
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,871
And tell the shit heel

594
00:22:00,871 --> 00:22:04,184
not to drink any more
of my goddamn beer!

595
00:22:04,184 --> 00:22:05,393
Son of a bitch!

596
00:22:06,394 --> 00:22:07,256
Fuck!

597
00:22:08,913 --> 00:22:09,742
- Okay.

598
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:14,850
[doorbell rings]

599
00:22:16,818 --> 00:22:18,267
- Hello, and a very
good day to you.

600
00:22:18,267 --> 00:22:20,615
I'm looking for Mr. O'Donnell.

601
00:22:20,615 --> 00:22:22,271
- Can I ask who wants to know?

602
00:22:22,271 --> 00:22:23,549
Because you guys look weird.

603
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:25,551
- Oh, I'm Monroe Nunley.

604
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,624
I'm here representing the
Whitestone Federal Bank,

605
00:22:29,624 --> 00:22:32,074
and we want to talk
to Mr. O'Donnell

606
00:22:32,074 --> 00:22:34,939
about delinquency
on his mortgages.

607
00:22:34,939 --> 00:22:36,769
- Oh, that sounds really fun.

608
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:38,598
He'll be back next month.

609
00:22:38,598 --> 00:22:41,083
- Well, I need to speak
to him immediately.

610
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:45,260
- Well, if immediately
means next month, then.

611
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,434
Okay?

612
00:22:46,434 --> 00:22:47,296
Yeah.

613
00:22:53,613 --> 00:22:54,959
- Who was at the door?

614
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:55,926
- I don't know.

615
00:22:55,926 --> 00:22:57,479
Some douche bag from the bank.

616
00:22:57,479 --> 00:22:58,687
- Bank?

617
00:22:58,687 --> 00:22:59,481
Shit.

618
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,590
Hi, can I help you?

619
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,350
Yeah, we've got--

620
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,076
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, okay, okay.

621
00:23:08,076 --> 00:23:10,389
All right, what
are you guys doing?

622
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,838
You can't come in
my house like this.

623
00:23:11,838 --> 00:23:14,945
- We're here to liquidate
$3,000 of your assets

624
00:23:14,945 --> 00:23:18,258
to cover back taxes on
Mr. O'Donnell's account.

625
00:23:18,258 --> 00:23:19,708
It's all explained in here.

626
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:22,262
We'll try to make this as
pleasant as possible for you.

627
00:23:22,262 --> 00:23:23,747
- Whoa, whoa, horseshit!

628
00:23:23,747 --> 00:23:25,196
Put this down!

629
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:26,405
Get out.

630
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,716
You want me to fuckin'
cut your nuts off?

631
00:23:27,716 --> 00:23:28,648
What's up?

632
00:23:28,648 --> 00:23:29,891
You want this up your ass?

633
00:23:29,891 --> 00:23:31,410
Fucking kabob your
dicks on this thing.

634
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,825
Not the Xbox!

635
00:23:32,825 --> 00:23:34,102
Shit, no!

636
00:23:34,102 --> 00:23:35,344
- Calm down.

637
00:23:35,344 --> 00:23:36,691
- Give them something
else, not the Xbox.

638
00:23:36,691 --> 00:23:37,864
Give them the
silverware or something.

639
00:23:37,864 --> 00:23:38,693
- Grow up.

640
00:23:38,693 --> 00:23:40,246
It's just an Xbox.

641
00:23:40,246 --> 00:23:41,765
We use that twice a year,
like Christmas and Easter.

642
00:23:41,765 --> 00:23:43,283
We use this every day.

643
00:23:43,283 --> 00:23:45,285
I'm not giving them
Grandma's silverware.

644
00:23:45,285 --> 00:23:46,977
- Dude, she didn't
like you anyway.

645
00:23:46,977 --> 00:23:47,805
Who cares?

646
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,810
- Silverware?

647
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:53,915
- Absolutely.

648
00:24:03,994 --> 00:24:06,445
- Some little son of a bitch
keeps putting cellophane

649
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,206
over the toilets at school.

650
00:24:09,206 --> 00:24:12,968
I spend all day long
mopping up piss and shit.

651
00:24:12,968 --> 00:24:15,246
When I catch who's
ever doing it,

652
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:17,801
there's gonna be hell to pay.

653
00:24:17,801 --> 00:24:20,562
And they're always
wising off to me.

654
00:24:20,562 --> 00:24:23,013
Lenny, you missed a spot.

655
00:24:23,013 --> 00:24:24,842
Lenny, shine my shoes.

656
00:24:25,981 --> 00:24:27,466
- Why do they call you Lenny?

657
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,915
- I don't know.

658
00:24:28,915 --> 00:24:32,022
Some stupid book they're
reading at school.

659
00:24:32,022 --> 00:24:34,852
- Could it be "Of Mice and Men"?

660
00:24:34,852 --> 00:24:36,336
- Yeah, that's it.

661
00:24:36,336 --> 00:24:37,545
You heard of it?

662
00:24:37,545 --> 00:24:39,650
- No, I have never
heard of that book.

663
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:42,066
- Hey, Harold, what are
you doing over there?

664
00:24:42,066 --> 00:24:42,895
- Oh, nothing.

665
00:24:42,895 --> 00:24:44,793
Just writing something.

666
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:48,038
- Who wants to fuck?

667
00:24:48,038 --> 00:24:49,660
- What's up, Joe?

668
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,662
- Who wants to fuck?

669
00:24:51,662 --> 00:24:53,215
- Guilty.

670
00:24:53,215 --> 00:24:54,216
- What do you want to drink?

671
00:24:54,216 --> 00:24:55,735
- Give me a shot of whiskey.

672
00:24:55,735 --> 00:24:57,772
- Yeah!
- Hey, hey, yo.

673
00:24:57,772 --> 00:24:58,704
- What's up?

674
00:24:58,704 --> 00:25:00,360
- Motherfucker, what's up?

675
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,603
- Three, four, five.

676
00:25:01,603 --> 00:25:02,639
- Thought it was just three.

677
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:05,055
- No, we're doing five now.

678
00:25:05,055 --> 00:25:05,987
- All right.

679
00:25:05,987 --> 00:25:07,506
- Can I get one of those?

680
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,508
- Namath was prettier, but
Tittle could throw the ball.

681
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,957
It landed where he threw it.

682
00:25:10,957 --> 00:25:13,719
- I can't believe you
dropped that fuckin' ball.

683
00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:15,306
- Will you shut up already?

684
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:16,549
It was like nine years ago.

685
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:20,001
- The pain may go away,
but glory lasts forever.

686
00:25:20,001 --> 00:25:21,520
- It was too high, man.

687
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,762
- Too high my ass.

688
00:25:22,762 --> 00:25:24,005
You don't know how
to run a route.

689
00:25:24,005 --> 00:25:25,282
- I don't know how
to run a route,

690
00:25:25,282 --> 00:25:26,525
you don't know how to
throw a fuckin' ball.

691
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,561
- We'll settle this once
and for all, all right?

692
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:29,804
All right?

693
00:25:29,804 --> 00:25:32,841
I want you to go out
on a Z-3 slant on one.

694
00:25:32,841 --> 00:25:33,670
- Are you serious?

695
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,533
- Am I standing?

696
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,603
Do I look serious?

697
00:25:35,603 --> 00:25:37,846
- He's very serious.

698
00:25:37,846 --> 00:25:38,675
- Blue 42!

699
00:25:39,572 --> 00:25:40,435
Blue 42!

700
00:25:42,368 --> 00:25:43,196
Hut!

701
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:46,959
- Oh!

702
00:25:47,856 --> 00:25:49,133
- Come on!

703
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:50,410
What the fuck kind
of pass was that?

704
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:51,584
- A perfect one.

705
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:53,068
- It was three
feet over my head.

706
00:25:53,068 --> 00:25:56,624
- Try wiping the jizz
off your hands, princess!

707
00:25:56,624 --> 00:25:57,556
- I'll clean it up.

708
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,315
- Yeah, Danny will clean it up.

709
00:25:58,315 --> 00:25:59,247
It's on me.

710
00:25:59,247 --> 00:26:00,697
Thanks for breaking that.

711
00:26:00,697 --> 00:26:03,251
- What you reading
there, Einstein?

712
00:26:03,251 --> 00:26:05,494
- About the Shanahan's contest.

713
00:26:05,494 --> 00:26:06,806
- Yeah, maybe you
better get your G.E.D.

714
00:26:06,806 --> 00:26:08,843
before you start writing
any essays, buddy.

715
00:26:08,843 --> 00:26:09,913
- Screw you, Andrew.

716
00:26:09,913 --> 00:26:10,879
- Let's be gentle.

717
00:26:10,879 --> 00:26:11,811
If you have nothing nice to say,

718
00:26:11,811 --> 00:26:12,985
then don't say it, you dick.

719
00:26:12,985 --> 00:26:15,332
- He's pretty special, okay?

720
00:26:23,892 --> 00:26:24,721
- What's up?

721
00:26:24,721 --> 00:26:25,894
How you doing?

722
00:26:28,345 --> 00:26:30,002
How was work?

723
00:26:30,002 --> 00:26:31,555
- The usual, whatever.

724
00:26:31,555 --> 00:26:34,662
- So the girls are probably
parking or something?

725
00:26:34,662 --> 00:26:35,594
- No.

726
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,699
No, they stayed in the city.

727
00:26:37,699 --> 00:26:39,149
- No vag?

728
00:26:39,149 --> 00:26:41,185
- For obvious reasons.

729
00:26:41,185 --> 00:26:42,324
Hello, Joe.

730
00:26:42,324 --> 00:26:43,878
Charming as ever.

731
00:26:43,878 --> 00:26:45,120
- No girls are coming?

732
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,363
- You guys aren't
fuckin' leaving.

733
00:26:46,363 --> 00:26:48,434
You promised me you
would stay all night.

734
00:26:48,434 --> 00:26:49,608
- Fine.

735
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,368
Fine, we'll stay all night.

736
00:26:51,368 --> 00:26:53,922
- Yo, yo, guys, guys,
guys, Monica's at Bogart's

737
00:26:53,922 --> 00:26:57,719
with four new friends from
beautician school or some shit.

738
00:26:57,719 --> 00:26:58,720
They want us there ASAP.

739
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,859
Let's go.

740
00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:00,895
- No, no, no, no, no.

741
00:27:00,895 --> 00:27:01,723
- Don't you fuckin' think--

742
00:27:01,723 --> 00:27:02,931
- You guys sit!

743
00:27:02,931 --> 00:27:03,725
- You guys said you
would stay here.

744
00:27:03,725 --> 00:27:04,726
You can't bail on me.

745
00:27:04,726 --> 00:27:05,589
Assholes.

746
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,697
- I'm glad to see you have
such loyal friends, Danny.

747
00:27:09,697 --> 00:27:11,560
- If we can't get our
friends in this fuckin' bar,

748
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,286
who the fuck are
we gonna get here?

749
00:27:13,286 --> 00:27:14,529
- Danny, it's fine.

750
00:27:14,529 --> 00:27:16,738
We can worry about
that tomorrow, okay?

751
00:27:16,738 --> 00:27:20,846
Do you mind if Janine and I
since no one's really here,

752
00:27:20,846 --> 00:27:22,295
if we kind of--

753
00:27:22,295 --> 00:27:24,228
- You guys are basically
having sex anyways right now.

754
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:25,713
So why don't you just go?

755
00:27:25,713 --> 00:27:26,575
It's fine.

756
00:27:26,575 --> 00:27:28,301
- Oh, I'm sorry, Danny.

757
00:27:28,301 --> 00:27:29,958
I'll try to bring my
friends next weekend.

758
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:31,960
It's kind of hard getting
them out of Manhattan.

759
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,789
- I understand.

760
00:27:32,789 --> 00:27:33,652
That's cool.

761
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:34,825
- It's really hard.

762
00:27:34,825 --> 00:27:36,378
- Hey, don't worry
about it, kid.

763
00:27:36,378 --> 00:27:37,656
We're still sticking with you.

764
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:38,933
- There you go.

765
00:27:40,486 --> 00:27:41,487
- We're here for you, kiddo.

766
00:27:41,487 --> 00:27:43,178
Right, George?

767
00:27:43,178 --> 00:27:46,078
- You should get
a corndog machine.

768
00:27:52,153 --> 00:27:53,257
- What's up, Phil?

769
00:27:53,257 --> 00:27:54,534
- What's up, Phil?

770
00:27:54,534 --> 00:27:55,743
Really?

771
00:27:55,743 --> 00:27:57,399
Right now you're gonna
be like, what's up, man?

772
00:27:57,399 --> 00:27:58,815
- Sorry.

773
00:27:58,815 --> 00:28:00,368
We didn't know what to
do with your brother.

774
00:28:00,368 --> 00:28:03,716
He did like, ten shots, and
he's been puking ever since.

775
00:28:03,716 --> 00:28:05,580
- What a dipshit.

776
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,512
What time is it?

777
00:28:06,512 --> 00:28:08,031
- Three.

778
00:28:08,031 --> 00:28:10,481
We didn't wanna take him home.

779
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:11,379
- Smart move.

780
00:28:11,379 --> 00:28:12,898
I like that.

781
00:28:12,898 --> 00:28:14,002
- Hey, silly.

782
00:28:14,934 --> 00:28:17,592
- Whoa, hey, look who's up.

783
00:28:17,592 --> 00:28:20,250
- Well, hello, Princess Natasha.

784
00:28:21,251 --> 00:28:22,701
- Fucking queer boss.

785
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,426
Will you take him in the tub,
please, and wash him off?

786
00:28:24,426 --> 00:28:25,255
Jeez.

787
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:27,567
Gross.

788
00:28:27,567 --> 00:28:28,396
Dumbasses.

789
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:36,266
- It's too bad that your brother
and his friends aren't 21.

790
00:28:36,266 --> 00:28:40,201
You guys would make a
lot of money off of them.

791
00:28:44,274 --> 00:28:45,620
- No fuckin' way.

792
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,173
- Danny, if history
has taught us anything,

793
00:28:47,173 --> 00:28:49,728
it's that success comes
from being resourceful.

794
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:50,659
You got to make your own luck.

795
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:51,902
No one's gonna do it for you.

796
00:28:51,902 --> 00:28:53,697
- I'm not having some
high school speakeasy

797
00:28:53,697 --> 00:28:55,181
and getting locked up.

798
00:28:55,181 --> 00:28:58,115
- Okay, first of all, we're
not gonna get locked up, so--

799
00:28:58,115 --> 00:28:58,944
Right, honey?

800
00:28:58,944 --> 00:29:00,393
You're in law school.

801
00:29:00,393 --> 00:29:01,325
We're not gonna get
locked up for that, right?

802
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:01,878
- You're gonna get locked up.

803
00:29:01,878 --> 00:29:03,224
- Boom.

804
00:29:03,224 --> 00:29:05,536
- I thought this relationship
was about support.

805
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:06,745
What?

806
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,918
- You're an idiot.

807
00:29:07,918 --> 00:29:09,437
- What do lawyers know anyway?

808
00:29:09,437 --> 00:29:11,128
Come on, man we gotta do this.

809
00:29:11,128 --> 00:29:12,681
- God.

810
00:29:12,681 --> 00:29:13,855
- Case in point.

811
00:29:13,855 --> 00:29:18,308
Bro-ski, how many shots
you have last night?

812
00:29:18,308 --> 00:29:19,136
- 10.

813
00:29:20,344 --> 00:29:21,173
- 10.

814
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:22,415
That's 45 bucks.

815
00:29:22,415 --> 00:29:25,315
Times that by 100
horny-ass teenagers.

816
00:29:25,315 --> 00:29:26,143
- No.

817
00:29:26,143 --> 00:29:26,972
- Come on.

818
00:29:26,972 --> 00:29:27,800
Danny, it's one night.

819
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,491
What could go wrong?

820
00:29:33,185 --> 00:29:37,983
- First of all, I wanna say,
welcome Mineola Broncos!

821
00:29:37,983 --> 00:29:40,226
[cheering]

822
00:29:41,987 --> 00:29:44,886
All right, we have some rules
at this fine establishment.

823
00:29:44,886 --> 00:29:45,749
- Rule number one.

824
00:29:45,749 --> 00:29:46,957
- One.

825
00:29:46,957 --> 00:29:48,441
- Is that there is
a three-shot limit.

826
00:29:48,441 --> 00:29:50,271
For every shot you get, you'll
get a stamp on your hand.

827
00:29:50,271 --> 00:29:51,962
After that, you're cut off.

828
00:29:51,962 --> 00:29:54,793
However, there is
no limit on beer.

829
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,070
Rule number one is in place

830
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,624
so that rule number two
does not get broken.

831
00:29:58,624 --> 00:30:00,799
And that is there is
no puking in this bar.

832
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,593
Rule number three is
that if you drove here,

833
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:04,009
you're not drinking.

834
00:30:04,009 --> 00:30:06,805
Drinking and driving is
exclusively an adult pastime.

835
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,841
You guys aren't
ready for that yet.

836
00:30:08,841 --> 00:30:10,739
Rule number four.

837
00:30:10,739 --> 00:30:12,293
You do not tell anyone
about this place

838
00:30:12,293 --> 00:30:14,502
that's over the age of 21.

839
00:30:14,502 --> 00:30:16,815
Not your siblings,
not your counselors,

840
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,196
not your parents, nobody.

841
00:30:19,196 --> 00:30:21,440
Or I will find you
and I will kill you.

842
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,682
Does everyone understand?

843
00:30:22,682 --> 00:30:24,270
- [All] Yes!

844
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,409
- All right.

845
00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:26,410
Go, Broncos!

846
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,239

Boom, boom, boom, boom.

- Take your shots.

852
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:50,676
- Receive.

â™ª Take it all in stride

862

00:31:17,082 --> 00:31:17,945
Do you have your stamp?

864
00:31:17,945 --> 00:31:19,187
Drink up!

Ah.

869
00:31:29,094 --> 00:31:29,922
Thank you.

00:31:31,751 --> 00:31:33,857

- Go, Broncos!

878

do this another time.

- Hi.

883
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:24,390
My parents wanna sign me
up for the daycare program.

884
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,219
- Lindsay!

885
00:32:27,842 --> 00:32:29,430
- You ruined my
mother's birthday.

886
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,914
- I know I'm sorry.

887
00:32:30,914 --> 00:32:31,708
You didn't tell me you
were bringing your parents

888

do you a favor.

I can't believe you'd
do something so stupid.

- Come on, have
some sympathy here.

893
00:32:38,508 --> 00:32:40,441
We're in a bad situation.

894
00:32:40,441 --> 00:32:41,373
- Fine.

895
00:32:41,373 --> 00:32:42,788
But you better not do it again.

896
00:32:42,788 --> 00:32:44,410
- Believe me, we're done.

897
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:45,549
We're never doing it again.

898
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:46,792
- Yeah, right.

899
00:32:46,792 --> 00:32:48,035
You know how much money
we made tonight, bro?

900
00:32:48,035 --> 00:32:49,588
Whoa!

901
00:32:49,588 --> 00:32:51,245
- Phil, do you know how
much trouble we can get in

902
00:32:51,245 --> 00:32:53,488
if we get caught doing this?

903
00:32:53,488 --> 00:32:54,869
- Do you know what Saturday is?

904
00:32:54,869 --> 00:32:56,526
Homecoming.

905
00:32:56,526 --> 00:32:57,734
- I don't get, really?

906
00:32:57,734 --> 00:32:58,977
- Yeah-uh.

907
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,219
- Why do you listen
to this asshole?

908
00:33:00,219 --> 00:33:01,876
- Not all of us can live
on daddy's credit cards.

909
00:33:01,876 --> 00:33:03,947
Some of us have to
work for a living.

910
00:33:03,947 --> 00:33:05,811
- You call serving
beer to kids working?

911
00:33:05,811 --> 00:33:07,813
- Yeah, I do what I have to do.

912
00:33:07,813 --> 00:33:09,056
- So do I.

913
00:33:09,056 --> 00:33:10,678
- No, please, don't leave us!

914
00:33:10,678 --> 00:33:11,920
- Go fuck yourself!
- No!

915
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,026
- You're not helping.
- What?

916
00:33:14,026 --> 00:33:15,269
That was funny.

917
00:33:16,442 --> 00:33:18,513
- Lindsay, would you
just give me a second?

918
00:33:18,513 --> 00:33:19,342
Wait.

919
00:33:21,551 --> 00:33:24,416
- You know I've been talking
you up to my father for weeks.

920
00:33:24,416 --> 00:33:26,935
Then I finally bring him down
here and what are you doing?

921
00:33:26,935 --> 00:33:29,731
You're serving drinks to
the JV cheerleading squad?

922
00:33:29,731 --> 00:33:30,732
- So stupid.

923
00:33:32,251 --> 00:33:33,287
I'm sorry.

924
00:33:33,287 --> 00:33:35,565
- Danny, this is serious.

925
00:33:35,565 --> 00:33:36,911
If you get this job,

926
00:33:36,911 --> 00:33:39,086
you're finally gonna
be on the right track.

927
00:33:39,086 --> 00:33:41,157
Then we can start
thinking about our future.

928
00:33:41,157 --> 00:33:42,917
- You're right.

929
00:33:42,917 --> 00:33:44,091
I'm doing this to
save my dad's ass.

930
00:33:44,091 --> 00:33:45,264
You know that, right?

931
00:33:45,264 --> 00:33:46,817
- I know what
you're trying to do.

932
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:49,165
But serving drinks to
kids is ridiculous.

933
00:33:49,165 --> 00:33:52,375
Promise me you
won't do it again.

934
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:55,240
- I promise you, I
won't do it again.

935
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,103
- All right.

936
00:33:56,103 --> 00:33:57,380
I have to go home now.

937
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,864
Do a little bit
of damage control.

938
00:33:58,864 --> 00:34:00,866
- You go do that.

939
00:34:00,866 --> 00:34:01,729
Okay?

940
00:34:01,729 --> 00:34:02,626
I love you.

941
00:34:02,626 --> 00:34:04,042
- I love you too.

942
00:34:12,636 --> 00:34:13,672
- Hey.

943
00:34:13,672 --> 00:34:14,949
What'd she say?

944
00:34:16,433 --> 00:34:20,851
- Well, I told her we
weren't gonna do it anymore.

945
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:21,680
- Really?

946
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:24,338
Well, that's interesting.

947
00:34:24,338 --> 00:34:25,166
- Yup.

948
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,273
So how much did we make?

949
00:34:28,273 --> 00:34:31,966
- Oh, you know, just,
$2,856 and zero cents.

950
00:34:33,381 --> 00:34:34,934
- Ooh!
- Yeah.

951
00:34:34,934 --> 00:34:36,902
- That just sounds good!
- Yeah.

952
00:34:36,902 --> 00:34:37,730
- Shit.

953
00:34:42,942 --> 00:34:43,771
Shit.

954
00:34:49,397 --> 00:34:51,813
[chattering]

955
00:34:56,232 --> 00:34:58,682
- So, hot shot, you didn't
try the 5% on that girl

956
00:34:58,682 --> 00:35:00,132
you're dating?

957
00:35:00,132 --> 00:35:01,444
- No, man.

958
00:35:01,444 --> 00:35:03,653
She's way more upscale
than that, you know?

959
00:35:03,653 --> 00:35:04,930
Met her at school.

960
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:06,034
- This girl's smart, huh?

961
00:35:06,034 --> 00:35:06,863
- Really smart.

962
00:35:06,863 --> 00:35:08,106
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

963
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,073
She dances to pay
for law school.

964
00:35:10,073 --> 00:35:10,901
- Oh, a lawyer.

965
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:12,075
You gonna be a lawyer?

966
00:35:12,075 --> 00:35:14,974
- No, no, no, I'm
gonna be a philosopher.

967
00:35:14,974 --> 00:35:17,115
- What's philosophers do?

968
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,117
- Teach other people
to be philosophers.

969
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,221
- To do what?

970
00:35:20,221 --> 00:35:22,223
- Nothing, hang out.

971
00:35:22,223 --> 00:35:24,605
- I should have gone
to college, Harold.

972
00:35:24,605 --> 00:35:28,160
- Yeah, but Fabio's
thong just got,

973
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,611
because Janine wants
him to move in with her.

974
00:35:30,611 --> 00:35:31,439
- Oh!

975
00:35:32,751 --> 00:35:34,373
[laughs] That's the first step.

976
00:35:34,373 --> 00:35:37,721
Next thing you know, you'll
be buying her tampons.

977
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:38,998
- I don't wanna hear that word.

978
00:35:38,998 --> 00:35:39,827
- You know what?

979
00:35:39,827 --> 00:35:40,862
Forget about it.

980
00:35:40,862 --> 00:35:42,174
You're all done.

981
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,418
- To the end of an era.

982
00:35:44,418 --> 00:35:45,246
- No.

983
00:35:45,246 --> 00:35:46,730
- Yeah, it's not--

984
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:49,112
It's not even official, so
why are we cheers-ing to that?

985
00:35:49,112 --> 00:35:50,320
- Oh, come on.

986
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,703
- In the end, they're
gonna get their way.

987
00:35:53,703 --> 00:35:55,946
I gotta go to the can.

988
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:57,810
- Hey, this is a good
thing you're doing

989
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:59,536
for your dad here, Danny.

990
00:35:59,536 --> 00:36:01,020
- Breaking the law?

991
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,609
- Putting your ass on the
line to fix this mess.

992
00:36:03,609 --> 00:36:04,921
- Yeah.

993
00:36:04,921 --> 00:36:07,475
What are unwanted sons
for anyways, right?

994
00:36:07,475 --> 00:36:10,168
- You're not unwanted, kid.

995
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,617
The old man loves you.

996
00:36:11,617 --> 00:36:14,275
- He's just playing hard to get?

997
00:36:14,275 --> 00:36:18,279
- Between the banks and the
booze, what do you expect?

998
00:36:18,279 --> 00:36:20,937
He could have used
some help a while ago,

999
00:36:20,937 --> 00:36:23,974
but he's just too damn
stubborn to ask for it.

1000
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:25,079
- Yeah, I don't know
what he's gonna do

1001
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:26,736
if we lose this place.

1002
00:36:26,736 --> 00:36:29,911
He's invested his
whole life into it.

1003
00:36:29,911 --> 00:36:34,122
- Well, looks like you're
on the right track.

1004
00:36:34,122 --> 00:36:37,125
- You know, I don't think
I'm coming back here.

1005
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:39,335
I'm tired of seeing the
kids all day at school.

1006
00:36:39,335 --> 00:36:41,613
I don't wanna see 'em here.

1007
00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:43,408
- Yeah?

1008
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:45,962
Where are you gonna go?

1009
00:36:45,962 --> 00:36:47,722
- I got places to go.

1010
00:36:48,723 --> 00:36:49,517
- Where?

1011
00:36:54,626 --> 00:36:56,421
- Son of a bitch!

1012
00:36:56,421 --> 00:36:57,732
- What?

1013
00:36:57,732 --> 00:36:58,664
What's the matter?

1014
00:36:58,664 --> 00:37:00,908
- It's the cellophane prick!

1015
00:37:00,908 --> 00:37:04,222
[breathing heavily]

1016
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,672
- Oh, man, what a day.

1017
00:37:06,672 --> 00:37:07,501
- What's up, Mike?

1018
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:08,433
- Hey.

1019
00:37:08,433 --> 00:37:09,710
- Let me get a beer and a shot.

1020
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,883
- Sure.

1021
00:37:10,883 --> 00:37:13,955
- See you, Danny.
- Take care.

1022
00:37:13,955 --> 00:37:16,475
- Is that the starting
halfback for the Broncos?

1023
00:37:16,475 --> 00:37:17,890
- No.

1024
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:20,376
- Hey, good luck in
the game on Saturday.

1025
00:37:20,376 --> 00:37:21,377
- Thanks.

1026
00:37:21,377 --> 00:37:22,964
- Right on, man!

1027
00:37:22,964 --> 00:37:24,276
Knock 'em dead!

1028
00:37:24,276 --> 00:37:25,104
Broncos!

1029
00:37:27,106 --> 00:37:29,074
What's he doing in here?

1030
00:37:29,074 --> 00:37:32,802
- A lot has happened in
the last couple days.

1031
00:37:34,562 --> 00:37:35,460
- Oh, shit.

1032
00:37:36,944 --> 00:37:37,876
What is it?

1033
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,535
- It's from the
liquor distributor.

1034
00:37:41,535 --> 00:37:43,606
Dad owes them 5,000
in back payments.

1035
00:37:43,606 --> 00:37:46,298
It says they're gonna
stop delivery tomorrow

1036
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:48,266
if we don't make
a payment in full.

1037
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,750
- Whoa, tomorrow?

1038
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,027
We got homecoming this weekend.

1039
00:37:51,027 --> 00:37:52,477
We're gotta kill it.

1040
00:37:52,477 --> 00:37:54,479
- Does it just continually
rain shit on my life?

1041
00:37:54,479 --> 00:37:56,481
- All right, well, how much
did we make this weekend?

1042
00:37:56,481 --> 00:37:57,758
- Almost four.

1043
00:37:57,758 --> 00:37:58,897
- Good, four grand.

1044
00:37:58,897 --> 00:38:01,175
Okay, so we just need a $1,000.

1045
00:38:01,175 --> 00:38:03,833
Where are we gonna get a $1,000?

1046
00:38:07,526 --> 00:38:08,803
What?

1047
00:38:08,803 --> 00:38:09,977
What are we gonna do?

1048
00:38:09,977 --> 00:38:11,496
- I don't think
you're gonna like it.

1049
00:38:11,496 --> 00:38:12,773
- No fuckin' way!

1050
00:38:12,773 --> 00:38:14,084
- You're not selling it.

1051
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:16,155
You're pawning it, and
we can buy the car back

1052
00:38:16,155 --> 00:38:17,985
within 30 days for
the same price.

1053
00:38:17,985 --> 00:38:20,056
- I am not putting Bertha
through that, okay?

1054
00:38:20,056 --> 00:38:22,058
We've had a lot of
memories together.

1055
00:38:22,058 --> 00:38:24,336
And I got my first hand
job in the back seat.

1056
00:38:24,336 --> 00:38:25,199
- I was there.

1057
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:26,027
I was driving.

1058
00:38:26,027 --> 00:38:27,235
- I know.

1059
00:38:27,235 --> 00:38:28,375
You looked back a few
times, I saw that.

1060
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:29,652
- I did not look back.
- You did look.

1061
00:38:29,652 --> 00:38:31,274
- Let's think about
the bigger picture.

1062
00:38:31,274 --> 00:38:32,448
- It's your bar anyway.

1063
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:34,208
Why do I have to get
dragged into this stuff?

1064
00:38:34,208 --> 00:38:35,313
- You used to live
in my basement

1065
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,555
and you have for three years.

1066
00:38:36,555 --> 00:38:37,591
- Why do you have to
always bring that up?

1067
00:38:37,591 --> 00:38:39,420
That has nothing
to do with cars!

1068
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,595
- Okay, homecoming.

1069
00:38:41,595 --> 00:38:43,217
After homecoming,
we'll take the cash,

1070
00:38:43,217 --> 00:38:44,667
we'll come back, buy our cars.

1071
00:38:44,667 --> 00:38:46,013
- It's so risky.

1072
00:38:46,013 --> 00:38:47,221
- It's--

1073
00:38:47,221 --> 00:38:48,049
All right.

1074
00:38:48,049 --> 00:38:48,878
Let's just do it.

1075
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:50,362
Give me the title.

1076
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,712
- Okay, this spunky
young man has our cars.

1077
00:38:55,712 --> 00:38:57,680
How do we get around now?

1078
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,508
I got you.

1079
00:39:00,579 --> 00:39:02,719
- Oh!
- Yeah, baby!

1080
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:04,859
- Dude, check this out.
- Whoo!

1081
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:07,137
[whooping]

1082
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,970
Give me some of those dice.

1083
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,351
- Hell no.

1084
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,282
They're my dice.

1085
00:39:14,282 --> 00:39:15,698
- You have so many of them.

1086
00:39:15,698 --> 00:39:17,631
- If I give you some dice,
you've got to give me your horn.

1087
00:39:17,631 --> 00:39:19,046
- Not equal value.

1088
00:39:19,046 --> 00:39:21,945
Chicks love the horn, right?

1089
00:39:21,945 --> 00:39:23,084
How do you like the horn?

1090
00:39:23,084 --> 00:39:25,466
What does it make you feel like?

1091
00:39:25,466 --> 00:39:26,536
Horny, horny.

1092
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,747
Horny, horny, horny.

1093
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,647
That usually is gold.

1094
00:39:33,647 --> 00:39:35,269
- I bet they just love the horn.

1095
00:39:35,269 --> 00:39:36,235
I'm keeping the dice.

1096
00:39:36,235 --> 00:39:37,892
- That used to kill.

1097
00:39:39,549 --> 00:39:40,481
What's up, baby?

1098
00:39:40,481 --> 00:39:41,689
Who's the baddest motherfucker

1099
00:39:41,689 --> 00:39:44,830
riding the mean
streets of Mineola?

1100
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:45,659
Ow!

1101
00:39:46,936 --> 00:39:47,764
- Are you okay?

1102
00:39:47,764 --> 00:39:49,248
- Yep.

1103
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,077
What's up, baby?

1104
00:39:50,077 --> 00:39:50,905
- What's up, girl?

1105
00:39:50,905 --> 00:39:52,251
- Hi, I have a question.

1106
00:39:52,251 --> 00:39:53,080
Remember me?

1107
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,668
I'm your girlfriend.

1108
00:39:54,668 --> 00:39:56,842
Why haven't you
called me back today?

1109
00:39:56,842 --> 00:39:59,949
A little car trouble,
you wanna hop on?

1110
00:39:59,949 --> 00:40:01,468
- But remember we were
supposed to go to lunch?

1111
00:40:01,468 --> 00:40:02,469
We had a date.

1112
00:40:02,469 --> 00:40:03,987
- Sorry, babe.

1113
00:40:03,987 --> 00:40:04,850
I was probably going to get
sponsored with this thing,

1114
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:06,127
doing new tricks.

1115
00:40:06,127 --> 00:40:07,025
[horn tooting]

1116
00:40:07,025 --> 00:40:08,406
- Okay, stop.

1117
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,545
Stop.

1118
00:40:09,545 --> 00:40:12,064
Danny, what happened
to your cars?

1119
00:40:12,064 --> 00:40:13,756
- What is a car really?

1120
00:40:13,756 --> 00:40:15,240
I mean, it's just a--

1121
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,862
- Are you guys gonna give
me a straight answer,

1122
00:40:16,862 --> 00:40:18,519
or am I gonna have to
fuck you with a pineapple?

1123
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:20,314
What is going on?

1124
00:40:20,314 --> 00:40:21,246
- Damn!

1125
00:40:21,246 --> 00:40:22,178
I'll tell you straight up, girl.

1126
00:40:22,178 --> 00:40:23,628
I will tell you straight up.

1127
00:40:23,628 --> 00:40:25,146
- Okay.

1128
00:40:25,146 --> 00:40:27,355
- We pawned that shit to
pay the beer distributor.

1129
00:40:27,355 --> 00:40:28,253
- Okay, wait, wait.

1130
00:40:28,253 --> 00:40:29,219
What?

1131
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:30,911
- You heard me.

1132
00:40:30,911 --> 00:40:32,982
- Okay, stop that!
- All right.

1133
00:40:32,982 --> 00:40:34,604
- You pawned your car?

1134
00:40:34,604 --> 00:40:35,536
- Yeah.

1135
00:40:35,536 --> 00:40:37,055
- Phil!
- What?

1136
00:40:37,055 --> 00:40:39,091
- I can't keep driving
out here every single day.

1137
00:40:39,091 --> 00:40:40,610
Wednesday is my only free day.

1138
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:41,956
How is this gonna work?

1139
00:40:41,956 --> 00:40:43,682
How are we ever
gonna see each other?

1140
00:40:43,682 --> 00:40:45,339
- You guys could
move in together.

1141
00:40:45,339 --> 00:40:46,547
- Dude, stop!

1142
00:40:46,547 --> 00:40:47,410
- Really?

1143
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,238
It's that bad.

1144
00:40:48,238 --> 00:40:49,067
- Or we could iChat.

1145
00:40:49,067 --> 00:40:50,033
- IChat?

1146
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:51,000
- Very accessible nowadays.

1147
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,863
- We can have sex on iChat.

1148
00:40:51,863 --> 00:40:53,243
- Yeah.

1149
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:54,555
- Are those my glasses?

1150
00:40:54,555 --> 00:40:55,867
- Yes.

1151
00:40:55,867 --> 00:40:57,109
Listen, Danny said
it would be cool.

1152
00:40:57,109 --> 00:40:58,421
We could get our
cars back on Monday.

1153
00:40:58,421 --> 00:40:59,595
- Hey.
- Hi.

1154
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:03,633
I have great news.
- What, tell me.

1155
00:41:03,633 --> 00:41:05,635
- My father got an
appointment next week for you

1156
00:41:05,635 --> 00:41:08,017
with the human
resource department.

1157
00:41:08,017 --> 00:41:09,432
- Really?
- Yeah.

1158
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,917
- How did you pull that off?

1159
00:41:11,917 --> 00:41:13,401
- I told him everything.

1160
00:41:13,401 --> 00:41:15,369
I told him your mom is gone,
your dad's an alcoholic,

1161
00:41:15,369 --> 00:41:17,613
and that you're really
being loyal to the bar,

1162
00:41:17,613 --> 00:41:19,856
and that you have no real
role models in your life,

1163
00:41:19,856 --> 00:41:22,272
and he went for it.

1164
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:23,481
- Great.

1165
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,206
- Danny, if you
start a heroin habit,

1166
00:41:25,206 --> 00:41:26,863
you can make VP in no time.

1167
00:41:26,863 --> 00:41:28,796
Ain't that right, girl?

1168
00:41:29,935 --> 00:41:31,834
- So what do you
think of my outfit?

1169
00:41:31,834 --> 00:41:35,044
- I don't think you've ever
looked sexier in your life.

1170
00:41:35,044 --> 00:41:36,321
- Well I took you
up on your offer,

1171
00:41:36,321 --> 00:41:38,116
and I'm gonna come
here and help you.

1172
00:41:38,116 --> 00:41:39,911
- I don't think it's gonna
be that busy tonight.

1173
00:41:39,911 --> 00:41:42,534
You know, it's a slow night.

1174
00:41:42,534 --> 00:41:43,880
- You should probably
just tell her the truth.

1175
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,054
- Just tell her.

1176
00:41:45,054 --> 00:41:46,193
- I was gonna--

1177
00:41:46,193 --> 00:41:47,159
How did--

1178
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:48,195
- Tell me what?

1179
00:41:48,195 --> 00:41:50,300
- Say it, don't spray it.

1180
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,648
- Look, we're still
doing the underage thing.

1181
00:41:52,648 --> 00:41:54,373
- But you promised me.

1182
00:41:54,373 --> 00:41:55,892
- I know.

1183
00:41:55,892 --> 00:41:57,204
There's nothing else
that we could do.

1184
00:41:57,204 --> 00:41:59,620
I had to pawn my car to
keep the liquor flowing,

1185
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,001
and it's just until Saturday.

1186
00:42:01,001 --> 00:42:03,451
- Why do I even try with you?

1187
00:42:05,868 --> 00:42:07,421
- Lindsay!

1188
00:42:07,421 --> 00:42:11,356
Lindsay, I'm sorry I have
no other choice right now.

1189
00:42:17,742 --> 00:42:18,674
- You okay?

1190
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,435
Cheer up, this'll
help you cheer up.

1191
00:42:21,435 --> 00:42:22,505
- Okay, stop.

1192
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,956
All right, that's good.

1193
00:42:24,956 --> 00:42:25,784
Stop.

1194
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:43,112
- Hey, buddy, we've
talked about this before,

1195
00:42:43,112 --> 00:42:48,117
and you said to never bring
it up again, but I'm going to.

1196
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:50,809
What the hell are you
doing with that chick?

1197
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:52,086
- Not in the mood, Phil.

1198
00:42:52,086 --> 00:42:54,054
- No, seriously, I
want an explanation.

1199
00:42:54,054 --> 00:42:55,952
She some kind of trophy
to you or something?

1200
00:42:55,952 --> 00:42:57,885
- You know what?

1201
00:42:57,885 --> 00:43:00,681
She is the only normal thing
that I have in my life.

1202
00:43:00,681 --> 00:43:01,579
- Normal?

1203
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,063
You think she's normal?

1204
00:43:03,063 --> 00:43:05,099
Because she eats a hot dog
with a knife and a fork.

1205
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:06,860
You know, that's not normal.

1206
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,068
You have two hands.

1207
00:43:08,068 --> 00:43:10,311
You pick up the hot dog,
and you eat it like,

1208
00:43:10,311 --> 00:43:12,555
Janine has a friend that
can eat it in one bite.

1209
00:43:12,555 --> 00:43:15,523
She, and it just disappears,
right down the hatch.

1210
00:43:15,523 --> 00:43:17,008
- Phil.
- It's awesome.

1211
00:43:17,008 --> 00:43:21,322
- I grew up doing my
homework on that barstool.

1212
00:43:21,322 --> 00:43:22,634
That one right there.

1213
00:43:22,634 --> 00:43:24,360
Do you call that normal?

1214
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,810
- I call it real.

1215
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:27,121
That's reality, man.

1216
00:43:27,121 --> 00:43:28,606
- That's not the reality
that I want anymore.

1217
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,885
- Yeah, she's beautiful
and she has a trust fund,

1218
00:43:31,885 --> 00:43:33,990
but that doesn't mean she
can walk all over you, okay?

1219
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:35,198
- What do you know?

1220
00:43:35,198 --> 00:43:37,856
- I know she makes
you miserable.

1221
00:43:42,067 --> 00:43:43,310
- I'm a big boy.

1222
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:45,139
I think I can take
care of myself.

1223
00:43:45,139 --> 00:43:46,416
- Okay.
- Okay.

1224
00:43:54,873 --> 00:43:55,736
- Hello.

1225
00:43:55,736 --> 00:43:56,910
- Broncos win, bitch.

1226
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:57,807
Oh, you should've seen it.

1227
00:43:57,807 --> 00:43:59,050
I rushed the field,

1228
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:01,431
and I knocked out
their fuckin' mascot.

1229
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:04,987
And then he came to, and then
I kicked him in the balls!

1230
00:44:04,987 --> 00:44:08,231
- Mike, the fact that you
carry a gun is very disturbing.

1231
00:44:08,231 --> 00:44:10,268
- Oh, tough loss, guys.

1232
00:44:10,268 --> 00:44:11,096
You suck!

1233
00:44:12,788 --> 00:44:13,996
Oh, grow up.

1234
00:44:13,996 --> 00:44:15,998
- Were you abused as a child?

1235
00:44:15,998 --> 00:44:17,551
Are you trying to
prove something?

1236
00:44:17,551 --> 00:44:20,278
- Line them up, because a
hell of a party is on the way!

1237
00:44:20,278 --> 00:44:21,106
- Okay.

1238
00:44:21,106 --> 00:44:22,625
Can't wait, Mike.

1239
00:44:22,625 --> 00:44:23,453
- Broncos!

1240
00:44:24,696 --> 00:44:25,524
Get some!

[upbeat rock music]

1242
00:44:31,116 --> 00:44:32,600
- Guys, all right, I'll
take these for you.

1243
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,774
I'll take these for you.

1244
00:44:33,774 --> 00:44:34,637
Hey, buddy.

1245
00:44:34,637 --> 00:44:35,465
- Oh, hey.

1246
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,126
- Okay, all right.

1247
00:44:41,126 --> 00:44:41,955
Hi.

1248
00:44:43,853 --> 00:44:46,960
Hey, shithead, let me give you--

1249
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:47,788
You love it.

1250
00:44:47,788 --> 00:44:48,789
You love it.

1251
00:44:51,067 --> 00:44:53,207
- Looks like you boys
might just make it.

1252
00:44:53,207 --> 00:44:54,070
- Yeah.

1253
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:55,071
- Cheers.

1254
00:44:55,071 --> 00:44:56,521
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1255
00:45:02,872 --> 00:45:04,080
[whistles]

1256
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,082
- Who wants to fuck?

1257
00:45:06,082 --> 00:45:07,394
- [All] Yeah!

1258
00:45:07,394 --> 00:45:08,809
- Yeah!

1259
00:45:08,809 --> 00:45:09,672
- Yeah!

1260
00:45:09,672 --> 00:45:10,708
[shouts]

1261
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:11,985
- Whoo!

1262
00:45:11,985 --> 00:45:13,227
Oh!

1263
00:45:13,227 --> 00:45:14,850
This place is a zoo.

1264
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:17,128
Give me a shot
and three rubbers.

1265
00:45:17,128 --> 00:45:18,301
- I got the rubbers.

1266
00:45:18,301 --> 00:45:19,820
- Got the shot.

1267
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:22,167
- Dude, where was this place
when we were in high school?

1268
00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:23,997
- Ain't no time to talk, fellas.

1269
00:45:23,997 --> 00:45:25,584
- You got some ID?

1270
00:45:26,585 --> 00:45:27,863
It's just too bad, isn't it?

1271
00:45:27,863 --> 00:45:29,209
Get out of here.

1272
00:45:30,037 --> 00:45:31,936
- You son of a bitch.

1273
00:45:31,936 --> 00:45:34,801
I thought this place was a
little too risquÃ© for you.

1274
00:45:34,801 --> 00:45:36,561
- Oh, I'm not here to socialize.

1275
00:45:36,561 --> 00:45:38,459
Just came to
congratulate the team.

1276
00:45:38,459 --> 00:45:39,875
They had an awesome game.

1277
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:42,394
- Mike, please, just complete
the circle of weirdness,

1278
00:45:42,394 --> 00:45:44,155
will you and become
a P.E. coach.

1279
00:45:44,155 --> 00:45:46,744
You can look at these
little boys all day long.

1280
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:50,126
- Hey, pain is passing,
glory is forever.

1281
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,128
- That's right.

1282
00:45:52,128 --> 00:45:52,957
Broncos!

1283
00:45:52,957 --> 00:45:53,854
- Go, Broncos!

1284
00:45:53,854 --> 00:45:55,338
Hey, Roach!

1285
00:45:55,338 --> 00:45:58,272
Oh, my God, you had an amazing
run in the third quarter.

1286
00:45:58,272 --> 00:46:00,343
I was watching you
the whole way, man.

1287
00:46:00,343 --> 00:46:01,966
You wanna sit down
and have a beer?

1288
00:46:01,966 --> 00:46:02,794
- Dork.

1289
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:07,005
- Yeah, oh, yeah.

1290
00:46:24,264 --> 00:46:25,092
- You.

1291
00:46:28,164 --> 00:46:30,684
- Hey, Lenny's beating up Tom!

1292
00:46:33,135 --> 00:46:34,446
- Take it outside.

1293
00:46:34,446 --> 00:46:35,620
- [Crowd] Fight,
fight, fight, fight!

1294
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:36,828
Fight, fight, fight, fight!

1295
00:46:36,828 --> 00:46:38,140
Fight, fight, fight, fight!

1296
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:41,074
Fight, fight, fight, fight!

1297
00:46:41,074 --> 00:46:43,593
- There's not
gonna be any fight.

1298
00:46:43,593 --> 00:46:47,011
I'm taking you to the
principal's office.

1299
00:46:48,081 --> 00:46:50,255
- Office is closed, bitch!

1300
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:53,707
[shrieks]

1301
00:46:53,707 --> 00:46:55,433
- Fight, fight!

1302
00:46:55,433 --> 00:46:57,021
- No, no, no, no!

1303
00:46:57,021 --> 00:46:57,849
Hey, what are you?

1304
00:46:57,849 --> 00:46:59,368
Get out of my way.

1305
00:47:05,063 --> 00:47:08,377
- [Mike] Hey, who just hit me?

1306
00:47:08,377 --> 00:47:10,586
[siren wailing]

1307
00:47:10,586 --> 00:47:11,414
- [Danny] Get back!

1308
00:47:11,414 --> 00:47:12,243
Get back!

1309
00:47:12,243 --> 00:47:13,520
- [Cop] Break it up.

1310
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,247
Let's go, up against
the wall, everybody!

1311
00:47:16,247 --> 00:47:17,973
Who's in charge here?

1312
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,942
- Thanks a lot, asshole.

1313
00:47:26,671 --> 00:47:28,846
That would be me, Officer.

1314
00:47:35,783 --> 00:47:36,715
- All right, look.

1315
00:47:36,715 --> 00:47:38,890
I gotta do something, all right?

1316
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,098
I got called here.

1317
00:47:40,098 --> 00:47:40,927
You know that.

1318
00:47:40,927 --> 00:47:42,100
I got called here.

1319
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,170
- No, of course,
you've got to report.

1320
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:44,827
Listen, he's my brother-in-law.

1321
00:47:44,827 --> 00:47:49,176
I'm just asking if you
could just bend a little.

1322
00:47:49,176 --> 00:47:50,971
- So what's the skinny?

1323
00:47:50,971 --> 00:47:52,973
- Let me say you two are
the luckiest sons of bitches

1324
00:47:52,973 --> 00:47:54,526
on the planet right now.

1325
00:47:54,526 --> 00:47:57,598
Since everybody was outside
and because I'm such a nice guy

1326
00:47:57,598 --> 00:47:59,980
and you're my brother-in-law,

1327
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,223
they're only gonna charge you

1328
00:48:01,223 --> 00:48:02,949
with five counts of
underage drinking.

1329
00:48:02,949 --> 00:48:05,675
Instead of the hundred,
which you probably deserve.

1330
00:48:05,675 --> 00:48:07,781
- Shit, well, how much are they?

1331
00:48:07,781 --> 00:48:08,886
- 1,000.

1332
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:09,921
- Oh.
- Not bad.

1333
00:48:09,921 --> 00:48:11,923
- That's not too bad.
- Each.

1334
00:48:11,923 --> 00:48:13,476
- 1,000 each?

1335
00:48:13,476 --> 00:48:15,927
- You guys should be
in jail right now.

1336
00:48:15,927 --> 00:48:16,790
- You know what?

1337
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:18,102
No, no.

1338
00:48:18,102 --> 00:48:20,794
I'm not sure if I'm
comfortable living in a country

1339
00:48:20,794 --> 00:48:22,451
where an 18-year-old
can't have a beer.

1340
00:48:22,451 --> 00:48:25,316
Yet he can go to war and
carry a gun and kill people.

1341
00:48:25,316 --> 00:48:26,455
It's unjust.

1342
00:48:26,455 --> 00:48:27,421
It's un-American.

1343
00:48:27,421 --> 00:48:28,767
- Shut up.

1344
00:48:28,767 --> 00:48:30,666
- All right, move to
fuckin' France then.

1345
00:48:30,666 --> 00:48:31,598
- Wha--

1346
00:48:31,598 --> 00:48:33,324
- You can drink when you're six.

1347
00:48:33,324 --> 00:48:34,946
Thank you very much.

1348
00:48:34,946 --> 00:48:37,328
We owe you big time.

1349
00:48:37,328 --> 00:48:38,846
- Yes, you do.

1350
00:48:38,846 --> 00:48:41,401
And if I may say, it's my
love for Bronco football

1351
00:48:41,401 --> 00:48:43,368
that saved your asses.

1352
00:48:43,368 --> 00:48:44,404
- Broncos.

1353
00:48:44,404 --> 00:48:46,164
- Go, Broncos.

1354
00:48:46,164 --> 00:48:47,338
- Go, Broncos!

1355
00:48:48,201 --> 00:48:49,374
Fucking idiot.

1356
00:48:50,789 --> 00:48:53,447
[phone ringing]

1357
00:48:55,691 --> 00:48:56,623
- Hello.

1358
00:48:56,623 --> 00:48:58,694
- Danny boy, how are you?

1359
00:49:00,316 --> 00:49:01,076
- I'm good.

1360
00:49:01,076 --> 00:49:01,939
I'm good, Pop.

1361
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:02,767
How are you?

1362
00:49:02,767 --> 00:49:03,595
How's rehab?

1363
00:49:03,595 --> 00:49:05,011
- Oh, great.

1364
00:49:05,011 --> 00:49:08,324
I'm doing the 12-step shuffle
over here and loving it.

1365
00:49:08,324 --> 00:49:09,808
- Oh, that's good.

1366
00:49:09,808 --> 00:49:10,982
It's good to hear, Pop.

1367
00:49:10,982 --> 00:49:13,916
- So how's traffic over there?

1368
00:49:13,916 --> 00:49:15,814
- Well, we had rush hour
there for a little bit.

1369
00:49:15,814 --> 00:49:16,954
- Oh, really?

1370
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,991
- Yeah, till we got pulled over.

1371
00:49:19,991 --> 00:49:21,613
Well, that figures.

1372
00:49:22,476 --> 00:49:23,961
Listen.

1373
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,998
That's probably because
of that fire I read about

1374
00:49:26,998 --> 00:49:29,276
over at 2612 Second Street.

1375
00:49:31,347 --> 00:49:32,970
- 2612 Second Street?

1376
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:33,936
Dad, that's the bar.

1377
00:49:33,936 --> 00:49:35,317
- I know it is.

1378
00:49:35,317 --> 00:49:37,353
Ain't that a damn shame?

1379
00:49:37,353 --> 00:49:39,079
- Dad, what are
you talking about?

1380
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:41,047
- It was a real shame.

1381
00:49:41,047 --> 00:49:43,256
It had to happen, I guess.

1382
00:49:43,256 --> 00:49:44,429
Burn it.

1383
00:49:44,429 --> 00:49:46,776
- Dad, I'm not
gonna burn the bar.

1384
00:49:46,776 --> 00:49:49,607
- Oh, yes, all
those poor people.

1385
00:49:50,711 --> 00:49:54,405
I'm sure the insurance
will cover it.

1386
00:49:54,405 --> 00:49:55,475
Burn it.

1387
00:49:55,475 --> 00:49:56,717
- That's enough, Mr. O'Donnell.

1388
00:49:56,717 --> 00:49:57,960
That is it.

1389
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,998
- I've just been
told I have to go,

1390
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:04,587
but I want you to burn that
fucking bar to the ground!

1391
00:50:04,587 --> 00:50:05,485
- Let's go!

1392
00:50:06,555 --> 00:50:08,729
- You old sons of bitches.

1393
00:50:09,696 --> 00:50:10,904
Cocksuckers.

1394
00:50:10,904 --> 00:50:11,732
Fuck!

1395
00:50:13,734 --> 00:50:16,082
- It's a great
entry-level job, Danny.

1396
00:50:16,082 --> 00:50:18,153
You'll learn the business
from the trenches,

1397
00:50:18,153 --> 00:50:21,052
which will prepare you
to move up later on.

1398
00:50:21,052 --> 00:50:22,640
- Great, that sounds perfect.

1399
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,780
So I'm gonna be out of
the office a lot, right?

1400
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:25,988
- No, no, no, no.

1401
00:50:25,988 --> 00:50:28,853
The first few years,
you'll be at your desk.

1402
00:50:28,853 --> 00:50:32,029
We have field agents who
do the actual inspections,

1403
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,031
but after two or three years,

1404
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,792
there's a good chance
you'll get out there.

1405
00:50:36,792 --> 00:50:37,620
- Two or three years?

1406
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:38,828
Great.

1407
00:50:38,828 --> 00:50:40,382
Paying my dues, right?

1408
00:50:40,382 --> 00:50:42,591
- I think you're going
to like it around here.

1409
00:50:42,591 --> 00:50:45,490
The insurance business has
been good to me and my family.

1410
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:47,699
- Is this your son?

1411
00:50:47,699 --> 00:50:48,528
- Him?

1412
00:50:48,528 --> 00:50:49,805
No.

1413
00:50:49,805 --> 00:50:52,808
That's me when I
was about your age.

1414
00:50:52,808 --> 00:50:54,430
Handsome devil, huh?

1415
00:50:55,362 --> 00:50:56,639
Come on.

1416
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:59,090
Let me show you
around the office.

1417
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:07,409
Fridays around here are
always Aloha Fridays.

1418
00:51:07,409 --> 00:51:10,619
It helps lighten the mood a bit.

1419
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:11,758
- Aloha, Herb.

1420
00:51:11,758 --> 00:51:14,830
- Aloha, Stu. [chuckles]

1421
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:17,039
Who says insurance can't be fun?

1422
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:20,180
Come on, let me show
you to your desk.

1423
00:51:31,433 --> 00:51:32,537
- Whoa.

1424
00:51:32,537 --> 00:51:34,160
Hey, cuz.

1425
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,816
You look fuckin' good, man.

1426
00:51:35,816 --> 00:51:38,198
Watch out, I'm gonna
fuck you. [laughs]

1427
00:51:38,198 --> 00:51:39,855
- I don't know if
I'm up for that.

1428
00:51:39,855 --> 00:51:41,339
- So, how'd it go?

1429
00:51:42,202 --> 00:51:43,997
Did you get the job?

1430
00:51:43,997 --> 00:51:44,791
Right?

1431
00:51:45,999 --> 00:51:47,690
- I don't think
I'm gonna take it.

1432
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:51,522
- I don't know if that's
the best idea for right now.

1433
00:51:51,522 --> 00:51:52,592
- Fuck you, what are
you talking about?

1434
00:51:52,592 --> 00:51:54,594
I thought you'd be proud of me.

1435
00:51:54,594 --> 00:51:56,113
- Two days ago, you
know, of course,

1436
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:59,116
I would have told you to tell
them to fuckin' fuck off.

1437
00:51:59,116 --> 00:51:59,909
You know?

1438
00:52:00,841 --> 00:52:03,706
But with these jailbait tickets,

1439
00:52:03,706 --> 00:52:05,708
they're gonna kill us
man and we're broke.

1440
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:07,296
And the bar and the house
are as good as gone.

1441
00:52:07,296 --> 00:52:09,712
It's not really a great
time to be passing up jobs

1442
00:52:09,712 --> 00:52:11,404
no matter how shitty they are.

1443
00:52:11,404 --> 00:52:13,095
- I guess you're right
and it sucks too,

1444
00:52:13,095 --> 00:52:16,892
because I feel like I
wanted this job so bad.

1445
00:52:16,892 --> 00:52:18,135
Now I realize that
I don't want it,

1446
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,206
and now I have to
fuckin' take it.

1447
00:52:20,206 --> 00:52:23,692
It's like if you broke up
with Janine for some reason,

1448
00:52:23,692 --> 00:52:25,452
then realized you're an idiot
and you're in love with her,

1449
00:52:25,452 --> 00:52:28,455
and got back together only
to find out she had a penis.

1450
00:52:28,455 --> 00:52:30,147
It's like it's
that bad, you know?

1451
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:33,115
- That'd be fuckin' rough,
'cause then it's like,

1452
00:52:33,115 --> 00:52:36,394
then you're like, well
whose turn is it to fuck?

1453
00:52:36,394 --> 00:52:39,535
Or like, do I do you
and then who does who?

1454
00:52:39,535 --> 00:52:40,950
- You would still be with her?

1455
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:42,228
- What?

1456
00:52:42,228 --> 00:52:43,712
Oh, no.

1457
00:52:43,712 --> 00:52:46,991
It's just like whoever we'd
probably figure that out later,

1458
00:52:46,991 --> 00:52:49,131
or like, she would
tuck it or something.

1459
00:52:49,131 --> 00:52:50,684
We'd work that out.

1460
00:52:53,411 --> 00:52:54,723
- So you're gonna
open the bar tonight?

1461
00:52:54,723 --> 00:52:56,173
- I don't really
see any reason to.

1462
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,865
I mean if we turn on the lights,
we're pissing away money.

1463
00:52:58,865 --> 00:53:00,798
- Do you want to get drunk
and look at some titties?

1464
00:53:00,798 --> 00:53:01,626
- Sure.

1465
00:53:01,626 --> 00:53:02,593
- Me too.

1466
00:53:02,593 --> 00:53:05,768
[energetic rap music]

1467
00:53:08,806 --> 00:53:11,740
[patrons shouting]

1468
00:53:17,332 --> 00:53:18,367
- Yeah.

1469
00:53:18,367 --> 00:53:19,437
- Yeah, baby.

1470
00:53:19,437 --> 00:53:21,128
Hi-oh!

1471
00:53:21,128 --> 00:53:21,957
- Whoo!

1472
00:53:23,752 --> 00:53:24,580
- Shots!

1473
00:53:26,686 --> 00:53:27,514
- Yeah!

1474
00:53:27,514 --> 00:53:28,757
- [Man] Oh, yes!

1475
00:53:28,757 --> 00:53:30,103
- I'm a bad boy.

1476
00:53:34,038 --> 00:53:35,142
- Yeah, girl.

1477
00:53:36,868 --> 00:53:38,974
Go ahead, baby, go ahead.

1478
00:53:44,704 --> 00:53:48,294
- So, Phil tells me
you're a bounty hunter.

1479
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:55,335
- I'm not a bounty hunter.

1480
00:53:55,335 --> 00:53:57,337
[laughs]

1481
00:53:57,337 --> 00:53:59,270
I actually own a bar.

1482
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:00,616
- Oh!
- Yeah.

1483
00:54:00,616 --> 00:54:02,791
I guess I should
say I owned a bar.

1484
00:54:02,791 --> 00:54:03,723
- Oh.

1485
00:54:03,723 --> 00:54:05,311
- All right, Stace, cough it up.

1486
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,898
- Jeez, Tony, give me a minute.

1487
00:54:06,898 --> 00:54:08,383
- I don't have a
minute, sweetie.

1488
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:09,246
Come on.

1489
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,177
- You want a minute?

1490
00:54:10,177 --> 00:54:10,971
I got a stopwatch, hold it.

1491
00:54:10,971 --> 00:54:12,145
Ah, go.

1492
00:54:12,145 --> 00:54:13,111
- Thanks, sweet cakes.

1493
00:54:13,111 --> 00:54:14,078
You've got to be kidding me.

1494
00:54:14,078 --> 00:54:14,906
- Two.

1495
00:54:14,906 --> 00:54:16,080
Ah, good time.

1496
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:19,014
- Such a slob.

1497
00:54:19,014 --> 00:54:20,429
- What was that about?

1498
00:54:20,429 --> 00:54:23,639
- We have to give him 200
bucks just to get on the stage.

1499
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:25,883
- That's ridiculous.

1500
00:54:25,883 --> 00:54:27,574
- It's so ridiculous.

1501
00:54:27,574 --> 00:54:29,058
I know.

1502
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:33,235
If you know of anything
better, you know where I am.

1503
00:54:33,235 --> 00:54:35,617
[giggles] I'm right here.

1504
00:54:35,617 --> 00:54:38,136
[upbeat rock]

1505
00:54:40,104 --> 00:54:43,003
[patrons shouting]

1506
00:54:58,295 --> 00:54:59,226
- Hey, hey!

1507
00:55:01,436 --> 00:55:02,885
- Danny, how we doing?

1508
00:55:02,885 --> 00:55:04,335
- We are killing it.

1509
00:55:04,335 --> 00:55:05,198
- Yes!

1510
00:55:08,339 --> 00:55:09,823
So what do you think
about the new remodeling?

1511
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:11,031
Not bad, huh?

1512
00:55:11,031 --> 00:55:12,930
Titties, never hurt anybody.

1513
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:14,103
- It suits me.

1514
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,072
Business is good.

1515
00:55:17,072 --> 00:55:20,144
- Yeah, I think
Pete would be proud.

1516
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,187
- Fuck!

1517
00:56:07,122 --> 00:56:11,609
- Harold, what the fuck
you writing in there?

1518
00:56:11,609 --> 00:56:12,955
- My retirement plan.

1519
00:56:12,955 --> 00:56:14,681
- Your retirement plan?

1520
00:56:14,681 --> 00:56:16,234
What, are you gonna
switch from disability

1521
00:56:16,234 --> 00:56:19,134
to social security,
you lazy bastard?

1522
00:56:19,134 --> 00:56:19,962
Let me see.

1523
00:56:19,962 --> 00:56:20,894
- No.

1524
00:56:20,894 --> 00:56:23,449
- Come on, Harold let me see it.

1525
00:56:26,037 --> 00:56:27,625
Thank you.

1526
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:28,557
- What's he got?

1527
00:56:28,557 --> 00:56:29,800
- Oh.

1528
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,872
Take away whiskey, and
our earth is a tomb.

1529
00:56:32,872 --> 00:56:35,840
- Oh, Harold, that's my line.

1530
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:38,187
- Harold, you trying to win
that Shanahan's contest?

1531
00:56:38,187 --> 00:56:40,086
- Yeah, I sent in a few.

1532
00:56:40,086 --> 00:56:40,914
What of it?

1533
00:56:40,914 --> 00:56:41,846
Give that back.

1534
00:56:41,846 --> 00:56:42,778
- Good for you, hope you win.

1535
00:56:42,778 --> 00:56:43,848
- Good luck on that, man.

1536
00:56:43,848 --> 00:56:45,471
Good luck.

1537
00:56:45,471 --> 00:56:47,334
- We are cleaning up.

1538
00:56:47,334 --> 00:56:48,577
You know what?

1539
00:56:48,577 --> 00:56:49,785
To making your own luck.

1540
00:56:49,785 --> 00:56:50,614
I love it.

1541
00:56:51,753 --> 00:56:53,410
- Hey, Danny,

1542
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:57,483
I just want to say thank you
so much for all this tonight.

1543
00:56:57,483 --> 00:57:00,796
You have no idea how much
better than Lucky's this was.

1544
00:57:00,796 --> 00:57:02,315
- So thank you!

1545
00:57:02,315 --> 00:57:03,523
- Anytime.

1546
00:57:03,523 --> 00:57:05,939
You guys can come
make money anytime.

1547
00:57:05,939 --> 00:57:07,113
- Dude, Danny.

1548
00:57:08,355 --> 00:57:10,288
Just a friend.

1549
00:57:10,288 --> 00:57:12,532
- What, are you a pimp now?

1550
00:57:12,532 --> 00:57:14,327
- No, I'm not, can I explain?

1551
00:57:14,327 --> 00:57:16,398
- Hey, Danny, I think we
need to get the donkey ready

1552
00:57:16,398 --> 00:57:18,193
for Stacey's show.

1553
00:57:18,193 --> 00:57:19,021
- That's good.

1554
00:57:19,021 --> 00:57:20,954
We should talk outside.

1555
00:57:21,955 --> 00:57:23,405
- I love donkeys.

1556
00:57:25,683 --> 00:57:28,030
- Lindsay, she was
just thanking me.

1557
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:29,100
All right, we helped them out.

1558
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,481
They made some money.

1559
00:57:30,481 --> 00:57:32,103
- That's the lamest
thing I've ever heard.

1560
00:57:32,103 --> 00:57:33,726
- How is that lame?

1561
00:57:33,726 --> 00:57:34,658
It's gonna save the bar.

1562
00:57:34,658 --> 00:57:35,486
- Who cares?

1563
00:57:35,486 --> 00:57:37,246
You have a job now.

1564
00:57:37,246 --> 00:57:38,420
- About that.

1565
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:41,596
I don't think I'm
gonna take the job.

1566
00:57:41,596 --> 00:57:43,080
- What, are you kidding me?

1567
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,875
- I'm not kidding you.

1568
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:47,498
I can't work in a cubicle.

1569
00:57:47,498 --> 00:57:48,982
I gave it a shot, I went there,

1570
00:57:48,982 --> 00:57:52,089
but I can't see myself
being in cubicle 4B.

1571
00:57:52,089 --> 00:57:53,849
I won't be Danny anymore.

1572
00:57:53,849 --> 00:57:55,989
- That's what adults do.

1573
00:57:55,989 --> 00:57:58,233
Maybe it's time for you to
stop being Danny the child

1574
00:57:58,233 --> 00:57:59,752
and start being Danny the adult.

1575
00:57:59,752 --> 00:58:01,305
- Where does it say
that being an adult

1576
00:58:01,305 --> 00:58:02,893
means you have to work in
a cubicle 50 hours a week

1577
00:58:02,893 --> 00:58:04,032
doing fifth-grade math?

1578
00:58:04,032 --> 00:58:05,516
Where does it say that?

1579
00:58:05,516 --> 00:58:07,138
- So you'd rather just serve
beer to degenerates and morons

1580
00:58:07,138 --> 00:58:09,175
your whole life?

1581
00:58:09,175 --> 00:58:10,625
- I don't know, maybe.

1582
00:58:10,625 --> 00:58:12,868
- Danny, I'm trying to
get you out of this place.

1583
00:58:12,868 --> 00:58:14,387
- And into what?

1584
00:58:14,387 --> 00:58:17,424
A job that I'm gonna hate
for the rest of my life?

1585
00:58:17,424 --> 00:58:19,392
- If you don't leave
here, you're gonna
end up in the gutter

1586
00:58:19,392 --> 00:58:23,741
with your loser cousin
and your drunk father.

1587
00:58:23,741 --> 00:58:25,225
- Wow!

1588
00:58:25,225 --> 00:58:28,090
You have done nothing but
make me feel like shit

1589
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:30,748
since we've been together.

1590
00:58:30,748 --> 00:58:31,646
Guess what?

1591
00:58:32,819 --> 00:58:37,134
[chuckles] I'm tired
of feeling like shit.

1592
00:58:37,134 --> 00:58:38,549
Yeah.

1593
00:58:38,549 --> 00:58:39,861
- Where you going?

1594
00:58:39,861 --> 00:58:41,379
- I think I'm gonna go inside.

1595
00:58:41,379 --> 00:58:42,622
I'm gonna hang out
with my loser cousin,

1596
00:58:42,622 --> 00:58:45,211
his whore girlfriend
and the bar degenerates.

1597
00:58:45,211 --> 00:58:47,385
Is that okay with you?

1598
00:58:47,385 --> 00:58:49,526
Have yourself a good life.

1599
00:59:01,365 --> 00:59:02,193
- Hey.

1600
00:59:05,058 --> 00:59:06,888
How'd it go out there?

1601
00:59:07,751 --> 00:59:09,718
- I walked away.

1602
00:59:09,718 --> 00:59:10,547
It's done.

1603
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,032
- You all right?

1604
00:59:13,032 --> 00:59:15,068
- Yeah, yeah, let's
talk about it.

1605
00:59:15,068 --> 00:59:16,242
I feel fine.

1606
00:59:16,242 --> 00:59:17,243
I feel good.

1607
00:59:17,243 --> 00:59:18,071
- Good.

1608
00:59:18,071 --> 00:59:19,556
- Yeah.

1609
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,178
I mean, we're making money.

1610
00:59:21,178 --> 00:59:22,489
- Yes, we are.

1611
00:59:22,489 --> 00:59:24,043
- And,

1612
00:59:24,043 --> 00:59:26,252
I think we're gonna
save this place.

1613
00:59:26,252 --> 00:59:28,219
- Great attitude, I love that.

1614
00:59:28,219 --> 00:59:30,946
- And I'm a free man now.

1615
00:59:30,946 --> 00:59:32,741
- You're definitely free.

1616
00:59:32,741 --> 00:59:34,571
- I think everything's
gonna be all right.

1617
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,573
It's gonna be all right.

1618
00:59:37,539 --> 00:59:39,990
[upbeat music]

1619
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:41,267
- This is awesome.

1620
00:59:41,267 --> 00:59:44,270
Gonna get up here
and dance myself.

1621
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:45,202
What's up, guys.

1622
00:59:45,202 --> 00:59:46,134
What's up?

1623
00:59:46,134 --> 00:59:48,308
Oh, excuse me, little lamp.

1624
00:59:49,378 --> 00:59:51,380
[hums]

1625
00:59:53,555 --> 00:59:55,626
- Oh, don't encourage him.

1626
00:59:55,626 --> 00:59:57,697
- Sure, right in here, come on.

1627
00:59:57,697 --> 00:59:58,629
I'll take it.

1628
00:59:58,629 --> 00:59:59,872
Yeah, get your fingers in there.

1629
00:59:59,872 --> 01:00:00,838
Sure.

1630
01:00:00,838 --> 01:00:02,357
- Get down!

1631
01:00:02,357 --> 01:00:04,428
- See who comes out with
more money tonight, baby.

1632
01:00:04,428 --> 01:00:05,705
- [Janine] Yeah.

1633
01:00:05,705 --> 01:00:06,568
- [Phil] How about some of this?

1634
01:00:06,568 --> 01:00:07,914
Some of this.

1635
01:00:07,914 --> 01:00:08,743
Oh yeah.

1636
01:00:10,917 --> 01:00:11,918
- No.

1637
01:00:11,918 --> 01:00:13,506
- Whoa, dollar bills, yo.

1638
01:00:13,506 --> 01:00:15,784
- Hey, Mr. O'Donnell.

1639
01:00:15,784 --> 01:00:16,613
You okay?

1640
01:00:21,307 --> 01:00:22,135
- Oh, over here?

1641
01:00:22,135 --> 01:00:22,964
Sure.

1642
01:00:22,964 --> 01:00:24,172
Yeah, put that in there.

1643
01:00:24,172 --> 01:00:25,552
Hey, guys, yeah!

1644
01:00:25,552 --> 01:00:26,726
Spank it!

1645
01:00:26,726 --> 01:00:29,556
Come on, Harold
give me a spanking.

1646
01:00:31,869 --> 01:00:33,457
I'll dip my balls in it.

1647
01:00:33,457 --> 01:00:35,321
Five bucks, and I'll dip
my balls in your beer.

1648
01:00:35,321 --> 01:00:36,253
Five bucks!

1649
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:39,152
- [Janine] What is
that old guy doing?

1650
01:00:39,152 --> 01:00:39,981
Is that gasoline?

1651
01:00:39,981 --> 01:00:41,327
- [Woman] Hey, look!

1652
01:00:41,327 --> 01:00:42,500
- Holy shit.

1653
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,537
[screaming]

1654
01:00:44,537 --> 01:00:45,331
Dude.

1655
01:00:46,781 --> 01:00:49,542
- Burn in hell,
you fucking dump.

1656
01:00:50,888 --> 01:00:52,338
- Oh, God, oh, God.

1657
01:00:52,338 --> 01:00:53,132
Dad, wait!

1658
01:00:55,582 --> 01:00:56,998
Jesus Christ, Dad.

1659
01:00:56,998 --> 01:00:58,551
What are you doing?

1660
01:00:59,828 --> 01:01:01,071
Son of a bitch.

1661
01:01:01,071 --> 01:01:04,453
Will someone take him
to the back, please?

1662
01:01:06,214 --> 01:01:10,321
- Man, you went down
like a little bitch.

1663
01:01:10,321 --> 01:01:11,633
- What are you talking about?

1664
01:01:11,633 --> 01:01:12,530
You went down too.

1665
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:13,842
- I teetered first.

1666
01:01:13,842 --> 01:01:15,085
You went straight down.

1667
01:01:15,085 --> 01:01:16,431
- What the hell
is wrong with you?

1668
01:01:16,431 --> 01:01:17,984
- Nothing.

1669
01:01:17,984 --> 01:01:19,054
Tie this guy's mouth.

1670
01:01:19,054 --> 01:01:19,883
Come on.

1671
01:01:23,645 --> 01:01:26,544
[soft blues music]

1672
01:01:35,312 --> 01:01:37,590
- What exactly goes on
behind those curtains?

1673
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:38,522
- Those?

1674
01:01:38,522 --> 01:01:39,868
Those are lap-dance booths.

1675
01:01:39,868 --> 01:01:42,008
Yeah, it's like pleasureville

1676
01:01:42,008 --> 01:01:43,561
for the lower half of your body.

1677
01:01:43,561 --> 01:01:45,529
Give a girl 20 bucks, she'll
dance around your body,

1678
01:01:45,529 --> 01:01:48,187
you know, all that good stuff
for, like, a whole song.

1679
01:01:48,187 --> 01:01:49,982
It's pretty awesome.

1680
01:01:49,982 --> 01:01:51,259
- It's really good?

1681
01:01:51,259 --> 01:01:52,743
- Yeah.

1682
01:01:52,743 --> 01:01:55,642
It's amazing what
they can do to you.

1683
01:01:55,642 --> 01:01:57,852
What, you want one?

1684
01:01:57,852 --> 01:02:00,268
- No, no, I don't
have the money.

1685
01:02:00,268 --> 01:02:01,062
- Oh, come on.

1686
01:02:01,062 --> 01:02:01,994
Who are you talking to?

1687
01:02:01,994 --> 01:02:04,134
Harold, it's on the house.

1688
01:02:04,134 --> 01:02:06,136
- [laughs] I'm not interested.

1689
01:02:06,136 --> 01:02:08,794
- Janine, Stacey, ladies.

1690
01:02:08,794 --> 01:02:10,519
Help my friend
Harold out here, huh?

1691
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:11,382
- I'm too old.

1692
01:02:11,382 --> 01:02:12,211
- You're gonna love it.

1693
01:02:12,211 --> 01:02:14,006
- I can't, I can't.

1694
01:02:14,006 --> 01:02:15,559
- Girls, put your,
do that one thing

1695
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:17,595
when you put your boobs
on each side of his head

1696
01:02:17,595 --> 01:02:19,252
and just like shake.

1697
01:02:19,252 --> 01:02:20,115
It's awesome.

1698
01:02:20,115 --> 01:02:20,944
- Hi!

1699
01:02:20,944 --> 01:02:22,186
Boy, oh, golly!

1700
01:02:23,049 --> 01:02:24,602
Oh, my God!

1701
01:02:24,602 --> 01:02:25,534
- Oh.

1702
01:02:25,534 --> 01:02:26,673
- Oh, what are you doing?

1703
01:02:26,673 --> 01:02:27,744
What are you doing here?

1704
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,538
- Oh, please be kind.

1705
01:02:29,538 --> 01:02:31,195
- Have fun, Harold.

1706
01:02:41,585 --> 01:02:43,173
Hey, you all right?

1707
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:47,177
- I don't know.

1708
01:02:47,177 --> 01:02:51,353
I don't know what to think
about my dad right now.

1709
01:02:52,458 --> 01:02:54,253
- Wanna talk about it?

1710
01:02:55,392 --> 01:02:56,600
Come on, man cheer up.

1711
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:57,532
Let's do some
shots or something.

1712
01:02:57,532 --> 01:02:58,809
Let's get crazy.

1713
01:03:00,293 --> 01:03:01,225
[Harold shouts]

1714
01:03:01,225 --> 01:03:03,641
[screaming]

1715
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:09,268
[siren wailing]

1716
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:33,602
- All right, so both you
ladies were on his lap?

1717
01:03:33,602 --> 01:03:35,984
- We were giving him a dance,

1718
01:03:35,984 --> 01:03:38,849
and he started to
breathe really hard,

1719
01:03:38,849 --> 01:03:42,853
and he grabbed his chest,
and he just fell over.

1720
01:03:44,303 --> 01:03:48,894
- [sobs] He said to
do the boob thing.

1721
01:03:48,894 --> 01:03:50,827
- That's all right, sweetheart.

1722
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:53,070
He had a bad ticker.

1723
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:55,659
Listen, it's not your fault.

1724
01:03:55,659 --> 01:03:58,179
I couldn't think of
a better way to go.

1725
01:03:58,179 --> 01:04:00,008
- Yeah?
- Yes, yes.

1726
01:04:00,008 --> 01:04:02,666
- You running the show again?

1727
01:04:02,666 --> 01:04:03,840
- We both are.

1728
01:04:06,394 --> 01:04:07,671
- Okay.

1729
01:04:07,671 --> 01:04:11,019
You have a permit
for the strippers?

1730
01:04:11,019 --> 01:04:12,572
- A what?

1731
01:04:12,572 --> 01:04:14,160
- Do you have a permit for
the strippers, yes or no?

1732
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,058
- Yes, yes.

1733
01:04:16,093 --> 01:04:17,854
- Yeah, of course.

1734
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:18,820
- Not this.

1735
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:21,064
No, that's a
Michael's gift card.

1736
01:04:21,064 --> 01:04:22,859
Why do I have a
Michael's gift card?

1737
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,136
- Arts and crafts sometimes.

1738
01:04:24,136 --> 01:04:25,620
- You know what?

1739
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:27,553
It's been a busy couple of
weeks for you guys, all right?

1740
01:04:27,553 --> 01:04:29,555
What the hell is
next around here?

1741
01:04:29,555 --> 01:04:31,143
[Pete shouting]

1742
01:04:31,143 --> 01:04:35,837
- Let go of me, you lousy
pig-faced cocksucker!

1743
01:04:35,837 --> 01:04:37,494
There they are!

1744
01:04:37,494 --> 01:04:39,945
They fuckin' kidnapped me!

1745
01:04:39,945 --> 01:04:42,533
Tied me up and left me to die.

1746
01:04:42,533 --> 01:04:43,949
[Pete crying]

1747
01:04:43,949 --> 01:04:45,743
Fucking unbelievable!

1748
01:04:47,814 --> 01:04:50,438
Their own flesh and blood.

1749
01:04:50,438 --> 01:04:51,542
Oh!

1750
01:04:51,542 --> 01:04:53,027
Oh, shit!

1751
01:04:53,027 --> 01:04:55,892
Oh, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!

1752
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:57,203
- Who was that?

1753
01:04:58,929 --> 01:05:00,827
- Got some good news.

1754
01:05:00,827 --> 01:05:03,244
I spoke to the D.A. and I
told him about your father

1755
01:05:03,244 --> 01:05:05,211
and the whole situation,

1756
01:05:05,211 --> 01:05:08,974
and he's agreed to drop
all kidnapping charges.

1757
01:05:08,974 --> 01:05:10,389
- That's good.

1758
01:05:10,389 --> 01:05:14,255
- But he's not budging
on anything else,

1759
01:05:14,255 --> 01:05:16,913
and he's fining
you guys $10,000.

1760
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:19,639
And you've got to
serve 120 days inside.

1761
01:05:19,639 --> 01:05:21,055
- Four months?

1762
01:05:21,055 --> 01:05:22,573
- You're kidding, right?

1763
01:05:22,573 --> 01:05:24,644
You're joking around with,
you're playing with us?

1764
01:05:24,644 --> 01:05:25,956
- It's not a joke.

1765
01:05:25,956 --> 01:05:27,164
It's in the papers.

1766
01:05:27,164 --> 01:05:29,615
More importantly,
it's on the internet.

1767
01:05:29,615 --> 01:05:33,067
Running a den of iniquity,
harboring a fugitive.

1768
01:05:33,067 --> 01:05:34,585
Oh, the dead dude.

1769
01:05:34,585 --> 01:05:37,761
Yeah, he wants to make an
example out of you boys.

1770
01:05:37,761 --> 01:05:39,936
And not that this matters,

1771
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:42,662
but the bank will wait to
foreclose until you're out.

1772
01:05:42,662 --> 01:05:46,528
Then you'll have 24 hours to
vacate the bar and the house.

1773
01:05:46,528 --> 01:05:48,289
- Honey, I need you
to get clippers.

1774
01:05:48,289 --> 01:05:50,429
I'm shaving my head.

1775
01:05:50,429 --> 01:05:51,257
I'm gonna do it.

1776
01:05:51,257 --> 01:05:52,396
- Phil, relax.

1777
01:05:52,396 --> 01:05:53,880
It's county, not Attica.

1778
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:54,709
- Relax?

1779
01:05:54,709 --> 01:05:55,952
Really?

1780
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:58,299
Gabe, easy for your
to say on the outside,

1781
01:05:58,299 --> 01:06:00,784
with your fuckin' three-foot
bong and your drum circle.

1782
01:06:00,784 --> 01:06:02,268
Everything's cool man, right?

1783
01:06:02,268 --> 01:06:04,132
I'm in jail, I'm in jail.

1784
01:06:04,132 --> 01:06:05,340
You wanna switch places?

1785
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:06,686
Is that allowed?

1786
01:06:08,757 --> 01:06:10,035
Ah!

1787
01:06:10,035 --> 01:06:12,278
[grunting]

1788
01:06:14,729 --> 01:06:16,558
I'm gonna need
fake tattoos, okay?

1789
01:06:16,558 --> 01:06:17,387
You got that?

1790
01:06:17,387 --> 01:06:18,422
Fake tattoos.

1791
01:06:18,422 --> 01:06:19,251
- Why?

1792
01:06:20,907 --> 01:06:21,736
- How many is that?

1793
01:06:21,736 --> 01:06:23,117
Are you counting?

1794
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:24,842
- Honey.

1795
01:06:24,842 --> 01:06:25,947
- How many am I doing?

1796
01:06:25,947 --> 01:06:27,707
- Need a place to stay?

1797
01:06:27,707 --> 01:06:30,641
[breathing heavily]

1798
01:06:30,641 --> 01:06:32,298
- Can't believe we
lost the bar, Phil.

1799
01:06:32,298 --> 01:06:33,506
- Dude, forget about that.

1800
01:06:33,506 --> 01:06:36,199
We gotta watch
our backs in here.

1801
01:06:45,656 --> 01:06:46,692
Damn it!

1802
01:06:46,692 --> 01:06:47,934
I need tattoos.

1803
01:06:49,729 --> 01:06:53,043
You know what Ed Gangemella
told me when he was in here?

1804
01:06:53,043 --> 01:06:57,323
He said you've got to assert
yourself early, get respect.

1805
01:06:57,323 --> 01:06:59,946
The first thing you gotta do
is get in a fuckin' fight.

1806
01:06:59,946 --> 01:07:01,465
Doesn't matter if you lose.

1807
01:07:01,465 --> 01:07:03,157
Doesn't matter if you get
the shit beat out of you.

1808
01:07:03,157 --> 01:07:05,814
I guess people know not to
fuck with you if you do that.

1809
01:07:05,814 --> 01:07:08,783
- Hey, Ed Gangemella
is a fuckin' moron.

1810
01:07:08,783 --> 01:07:10,026
What the fuck?

1811
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:12,994
Why do you think he
ended up in jail?

1812
01:07:12,994 --> 01:07:14,306
- We're in jail.

1813
01:07:17,343 --> 01:07:19,449
I just like, I really, really,

1814
01:07:19,449 --> 01:07:20,691
I don't wanna get butt-fucked.

1815
01:07:20,691 --> 01:07:22,762
I just don't wanna
get butt-fucked.

1816
01:07:22,762 --> 01:07:24,868
- Then stop saying butt-fucked.

1817
01:07:24,868 --> 01:07:27,146
- I have a tiny
anus, you know that.

1818
01:07:27,146 --> 01:07:29,148
- Look, just don't talk.

1819
01:07:32,324 --> 01:07:35,913
- Yo man, I need
that bottom bunk.

1820
01:07:35,913 --> 01:07:37,536
I can't get up there.

1821
01:07:37,536 --> 01:07:39,296
- No man, it's mine.

1822
01:07:39,296 --> 01:07:40,194
Beat it.

1823
01:07:40,194 --> 01:07:41,057
- What?

1824
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:43,921
I don't think I'm
hearing you right.

1825
01:07:43,921 --> 01:07:46,407
- You heard me just
fine, get lost.

1826
01:07:46,407 --> 01:07:48,202
- You know what?

1827
01:07:48,202 --> 01:07:50,618
I have warmed up
this blanket for you.

1828
01:07:50,618 --> 01:07:52,309
I'll make your bed.

1829
01:07:52,309 --> 01:07:53,172
You wanna lay down here?

1830
01:07:53,172 --> 01:07:54,760
- No, no, no, no, no.

1831
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,417
Now I want this one.

1832
01:08:00,248 --> 01:08:02,768
- Do you know who
I am, motherfucker?

1833
01:08:02,768 --> 01:08:04,183
- Yeah.

1834
01:08:04,183 --> 01:08:06,565
You the motherfucker
that's gonna be sleeping

1835
01:08:06,565 --> 01:08:08,291
on the top bunk.

1836
01:08:08,291 --> 01:08:10,638
- [Pete] Is there a fuckin'
problem here, Andre?

1837
01:08:10,638 --> 01:08:14,331
- Yeah, I asked this
asshole nicely if--

1838
01:08:14,331 --> 01:08:15,332
- Danny.

1839
01:08:15,332 --> 01:08:16,161
- Dad?

1840
01:08:17,748 --> 01:08:19,095
What are you doing here?

1841
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:20,751
- They kicked me out of rehab.

1842
01:08:20,751 --> 01:08:23,237
What the hell are
you doing here?

1843
01:08:23,237 --> 01:08:25,825
- Oh, well, wait a sec.

1844
01:08:25,825 --> 01:08:27,413
You know this guy?

1845
01:08:27,413 --> 01:08:29,519
- You Pete's kid?

1846
01:08:29,519 --> 01:08:30,865
- Yeah.

1847
01:08:30,865 --> 01:08:31,935
- What's up?

1848
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,110
Yeah.

1849
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,111
- Man, you--

1850
01:08:36,215 --> 01:08:38,321
- Who the fuck is this?

1851
01:08:38,321 --> 01:08:39,149
- Whoo.

1852
01:08:39,149 --> 01:08:40,840
- I don't know him.

1853
01:08:42,739 --> 01:08:45,017
- Hey Dad, so, like do you,

1854
01:08:46,812 --> 01:08:48,710
do you, like what's up?

1855
01:08:49,918 --> 01:08:51,127
Do you,

1856
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,162
have you ever been
like do you butt fuck?

1857
01:08:52,162 --> 01:08:53,025
How does that--

1858
01:08:53,025 --> 01:08:53,853
Oh, God.

1859
01:08:55,234 --> 01:08:58,651
So basically, Foucault says
that anyone who wouldn't submit,

1860
01:08:58,651 --> 01:09:01,344
who wouldn't be a cog in the
machine, would end up here,

1861
01:09:01,344 --> 01:09:04,450
in jail, until they've learned
how to sublimate themselves

1862
01:09:04,450 --> 01:09:07,143
to the will of the
capitalist machine.

1863
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:08,661
It's all economic.

1864
01:09:09,628 --> 01:09:12,182
- Now, that is some heavy shit.

1865
01:09:15,944 --> 01:09:19,189
- You know where
I can get a shank?

1866
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:21,881
- I can't believe he's dead.

1867
01:09:21,881 --> 01:09:23,745
The poor bastard.

1868
01:09:23,745 --> 01:09:25,195
- The weird thing
is Gabe got a call

1869
01:09:25,195 --> 01:09:28,164
saying that Harold left
you his entire estate.

1870
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:29,648
- Yeah.

1871
01:09:29,648 --> 01:09:33,238
- It was only $220 and an
Elvis vinyl collection,

1872
01:09:33,238 --> 01:09:36,965
but I never knew you
guys were that close.

1873
01:09:36,965 --> 01:09:40,210
- He was trying to
square up his tab.

1874
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:42,937
When he went on the disability,

1875
01:09:42,937 --> 01:09:45,767
he didn't have two nickels
to scratch together,

1876
01:09:45,767 --> 01:09:48,114
so I let him drink for free.

1877
01:09:49,806 --> 01:09:51,532
- You did that?

1878
01:09:51,532 --> 01:09:52,981
- He's been coming to
the bar for 20 years.

1879
01:09:52,981 --> 01:09:55,501
I'm gonna put him
out on the street?

1880
01:09:55,501 --> 01:09:58,090
- But that was really
nice of you, Dad.

1881
01:09:58,090 --> 01:10:01,576
- Occasionally I have
moments of weakness.

1882
01:10:03,509 --> 01:10:05,891
And I want you to know,

1883
01:10:05,891 --> 01:10:10,482
I know you did your best to
save the bar and the house.

1884
01:10:12,104 --> 01:10:14,244
And I appreciate it.

1885
01:10:14,244 --> 01:10:15,107
- You do?

1886
01:10:16,281 --> 01:10:19,663
- And I'm pretty much
sorry for everything.

1887
01:10:22,666 --> 01:10:27,499
You wouldn't be here if it
weren't for the mess I made.

1888
01:10:27,499 --> 01:10:29,225
- Pretty much sorry?

1889
01:10:34,678 --> 01:10:35,679
- I'm sorry.

1890
01:10:39,062 --> 01:10:39,856
Thanks.

1891
01:10:42,859 --> 01:10:44,412
You gave it a shot.

1892
01:10:46,863 --> 01:10:49,245
And I'm proud of you.

1893
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,384
- Thanks, Dad.

1894
01:10:54,077 --> 01:10:55,354
I love you, Dad.

1895
01:10:57,563 --> 01:10:58,806
- All right, all right.

1896
01:10:58,806 --> 01:11:01,429
Don't touch me
like that in here.

1897
01:11:05,364 --> 01:11:06,227
Jesus.

1898
01:11:15,754 --> 01:11:18,204
- Live free or
die, motherfuckers!

1899
01:11:18,204 --> 01:11:19,205
- Ow!

1900
01:11:19,205 --> 01:11:20,172
- Oh, hey.

1901
01:11:20,172 --> 01:11:21,967
- I'm still an ass virgin!

1902
01:11:21,967 --> 01:11:22,795
- Yay!

1903
01:11:22,795 --> 01:11:23,727
- Yeah, hey.

1904
01:11:23,727 --> 01:11:24,935
All right, all right, all right.

1905
01:11:24,935 --> 01:11:27,213
[cheering]

1906
01:11:29,112 --> 01:11:30,286
- Glad to see you guys are here.

1907
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,736
- Glad you guys survived.

1908
01:11:32,736 --> 01:11:36,119
- So, what, this is
the last day then?

1909
01:11:36,119 --> 01:11:37,362
- Oh, shit.

1910
01:11:37,362 --> 01:11:38,604
We gotta be out of
here by tomorrow?

1911
01:11:38,604 --> 01:11:39,709
I forgot.

1912
01:11:39,709 --> 01:11:41,331
What are we gonna do?

1913
01:11:41,331 --> 01:11:42,643
- I know what we're gonna do.

1914
01:11:42,643 --> 01:11:44,161
Why don't we polish
off these fuckin' kegs,

1915
01:11:44,161 --> 01:11:45,749
drink as much liquor as we can,

1916
01:11:45,749 --> 01:11:47,889
get fuckin' wild
for Pete's sake,

1917
01:11:47,889 --> 01:11:49,512
before these barbarians
take over the bar?

1918
01:11:49,512 --> 01:11:50,582
- Fuck those heathen bastards.

1919
01:11:50,582 --> 01:11:51,410
- Yeah.

1920
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:52,653
- Fucking scumbags.

1921
01:11:52,653 --> 01:11:54,310
- All right, guys,
let's do this.

1922
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:55,380
This is it.

1923
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:56,208
Yeah!

1924
01:11:57,727 --> 01:11:58,831
- This is it.

1925
01:11:58,831 --> 01:11:59,660
- To Pete.

1926
01:11:59,660 --> 01:12:00,419
- To Pete, yeah.

1927
01:12:00,419 --> 01:12:01,247
- Pete.

1928
01:12:01,247 --> 01:12:02,076
- Pete.

1929
01:12:02,076 --> 01:12:02,904
Come on.

1930
01:12:02,904 --> 01:12:03,733
- Mazel tov.

1931
01:12:03,733 --> 01:12:05,528
- Mazel tov.

1932
01:12:05,528 --> 01:12:07,806
[laughing]

1933
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:13,812
- You know, and I've been
thinking a little bit.

1934
01:12:13,812 --> 01:12:15,054
- Oh.

1935
01:12:15,054 --> 01:12:18,610
- And I think, if you
think that we're ready,

1936
01:12:18,610 --> 01:12:21,302
that we should move in together.

1937
01:12:23,062 --> 01:12:26,238
- Yeah, about that,
I changed my mind.

1938
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:33,728
- Really?

1939
01:12:36,213 --> 01:12:37,042
- Um, no.

1940
01:12:38,112 --> 01:12:39,182
Are you kidding me?

1941
01:12:39,182 --> 01:12:40,148
- What?

1942
01:12:40,148 --> 01:12:41,046
- Of course we're ready.

1943
01:12:41,046 --> 01:12:41,874
- What the fuck?

1944
01:12:41,874 --> 01:12:43,048
Okay, gee.

1945
01:12:43,048 --> 01:12:44,429
- It was my idea.

1946
01:12:44,429 --> 01:12:45,395
- Yeah, I know.

1947
01:12:45,395 --> 01:12:46,948
- You're so cute.

1948
01:12:46,948 --> 01:12:49,744
- I just [sighs]

1949
01:12:49,744 --> 01:12:52,229
I just don't wanna
screw things up.

1950
01:12:52,229 --> 01:12:56,648
You know, I'm really
happy with you, with us.

1951
01:12:56,648 --> 01:13:00,479
I just never learned how
to do this the right way.

1952
01:13:00,479 --> 01:13:02,723
- Hey, we're gonna be fine.

1953
01:13:04,483 --> 01:13:05,553
- I love you.

1954
01:13:06,692 --> 01:13:09,419
- That's good,
'cause I love you,

1955
01:13:10,662 --> 01:13:11,490
a lot.

1956
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:12,353
- A lot?

1957
01:13:12,353 --> 01:13:13,181
- A lot.

1958
01:13:13,181 --> 01:13:14,010
- Oh, crap.

1959
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:14,907
- Oh, crap.

1960
01:13:49,701 --> 01:13:51,012
[groans]

1961
01:13:51,012 --> 01:13:51,841
- Ah.

1962
01:13:51,841 --> 01:13:53,118
- Oh.

1963
01:13:53,118 --> 01:13:56,190
- Gentlemen, we are here
to foreclose on the bar

1964
01:13:56,190 --> 01:14:00,436
and on the residence and to
seize any sellable assets.

1965
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:04,370
It's all here in the
paperwork, Mr. O'Donnell.

1966
01:14:04,370 --> 01:14:07,960
You can peruse that
at your leisure.

1967
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:10,307
- What are you doing
out of your coffin?

1968
01:14:10,307 --> 01:14:13,621
Don't you guys turn to
dust, like in the light?

1969
01:14:13,621 --> 01:14:14,933
- [chuckles] Yes, yes.

1970
01:14:14,933 --> 01:14:17,280
Yes, Mr. O'Donnell,
that's very funny.

1971
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:20,594
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave now.

1972
01:14:20,594 --> 01:14:22,216
- That's fine.

1973
01:14:22,216 --> 01:14:23,044
We'll go.

1974
01:14:24,252 --> 01:14:26,254
But we're gonna
get a beer first.

1975
01:14:26,254 --> 01:14:27,083
- Wow.

1976
01:14:27,083 --> 01:14:27,911
- Yeah.

1977
01:14:27,911 --> 01:14:29,534
- Oh, well.

1978
01:14:29,534 --> 01:14:34,539
You gentlemen are aware that
the beer now belongs to us?

1979
01:14:35,436 --> 01:14:37,473
- Put it on our tab, shithead.

1980
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:38,335
- Oh.

1981
01:14:38,335 --> 01:14:39,164
- Ah.

1982
01:14:39,164 --> 01:14:40,096
Oh, my God.

1983
01:14:42,339 --> 01:14:43,168
Whoa.

1984
01:14:54,973 --> 01:14:56,043
- Oh, my God.

1985
01:15:02,877 --> 01:15:04,430
- Ah.

1986
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:05,570
Does that look straight?

1987
01:15:05,570 --> 01:15:07,364
- You don't.

1988
01:15:07,364 --> 01:15:10,367
- Well, good day
to you, gentlemen.

1989
01:15:12,611 --> 01:15:13,785
- What a dick.

1990
01:15:14,717 --> 01:15:16,132
I don't feel good.

1991
01:15:16,132 --> 01:15:17,236
- I don't feel good either.

1992
01:15:17,236 --> 01:15:18,652
- I need to sit down.

1993
01:15:18,652 --> 01:15:19,515
- Me too.

1994
01:15:26,107 --> 01:15:26,936
Hey.

1995
01:15:26,936 --> 01:15:27,764
- What?

1996
01:15:27,764 --> 01:15:29,145
- Cousins for life.

1997
01:15:29,145 --> 01:15:29,973
- Life.

1998
01:15:34,288 --> 01:15:35,876
I need to lay down.

1999
01:15:38,292 --> 01:15:40,950
- Might as well get used to it.

2000
01:15:58,554 --> 01:15:59,485
- Oh, boy.

2001
01:16:16,675 --> 01:16:18,228
- Why?

2002
01:16:18,228 --> 01:16:20,196
- Sorry to wake you.

2003
01:16:20,196 --> 01:16:24,856
Would either one of you know
where I can find Harold Kahill?

2004
01:16:24,856 --> 01:16:25,960
Does he owe you money?

2005
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:26,892
- Quite the opposite.

2006
01:16:26,892 --> 01:16:28,342
My name is J.R. Mulvahill.

2007
01:16:28,342 --> 01:16:30,793
I'm with Shanahan
Whiskey Incorporated.

2008
01:16:30,793 --> 01:16:32,795
He won our essay contest.

2009
01:16:32,795 --> 01:16:34,590
I'm here to tell him
that he has a pub

2010
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:37,006
waiting for him in
Dublin, Ireland.

2011
01:16:37,006 --> 01:16:37,834
- What?

2012
01:16:37,834 --> 01:16:38,663
- No fuckin' way.

2013
01:16:38,663 --> 01:16:39,836
- I'm serious.

2014
01:16:39,836 --> 01:16:41,113
We called, but the
phone was disconnected.

2015
01:16:41,113 --> 01:16:43,564
Then I went by his house
and there was no answer.

2016
01:16:43,564 --> 01:16:46,636
He put this place down
here as his work address.

2017
01:16:46,636 --> 01:16:47,499
- He won.

2018
01:16:47,499 --> 01:16:48,811
- Absolutely.

2019
01:16:48,811 --> 01:16:50,467
Our head reader called,

2020
01:16:50,467 --> 01:16:53,747
take away whiskey, and
our earth is a tomb

2021
01:16:53,747 --> 01:16:55,714
a humorous metaphysical romp,

2022
01:16:55,714 --> 01:16:58,234
amply worthy of the
Shanahan essay contest.

2023
01:16:58,234 --> 01:16:59,062
- That's my fuckin' line.

2024
01:16:59,062 --> 01:17:00,546
He stole my line.

2025
01:17:03,584 --> 01:17:05,621
- I'm sorry to
inform you of this,

2026
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:08,037
but Harold died
of a heart attack.

2027
01:17:08,037 --> 01:17:11,316
- Oh well, that's a
terrible thing to hear.

2028
01:17:11,316 --> 01:17:13,421
- It was all very sudden.

2029
01:17:15,596 --> 01:17:19,738
- Do you happen to know
who's handling his estate?

2030
01:17:23,190 --> 01:17:26,365
- As a matter of fact, I do.

2031
01:17:26,365 --> 01:17:28,920
[upbeat music]

2032
01:17:44,142 --> 01:17:46,592
[chattering]

2033
01:17:52,046 --> 01:17:53,565
- Hey, Pop.

2034
01:17:53,565 --> 01:17:55,360
You want another
sparkling water?

2035
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:56,672
- That would be great.

2036
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:57,742
- You got it.

2037
01:17:58,708 --> 01:17:59,571
Come on.

2038
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:03,333
- Thanks, Danny boy.

2039
01:18:04,783 --> 01:18:06,198
- Hey, how about I throw a
shot of Jameson in there,

2040
01:18:06,198 --> 01:18:08,028
you old sot?

2041
01:18:08,028 --> 01:18:09,685
- How'd you like me
to come over there

2042
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:12,273
and kick your fuckin' teeth in?

2043
01:18:12,273 --> 01:18:13,689
- Holy shit.

2044
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:14,551
- He's not lying.

2045
01:18:14,551 --> 01:18:15,794
- I know.

2046
01:18:15,794 --> 01:18:17,313
- So what time do
you guys get off?

2047
01:18:17,313 --> 01:18:18,970
We know of a party later.

2048
01:18:18,970 --> 01:18:22,145
- Ladies, I'm gonna
have to say I'm sorry.

2049
01:18:22,145 --> 01:18:25,390
And as you say in your
language, I'm off the market.

2050
01:18:25,390 --> 01:18:26,218
- Oh.

2051
01:18:27,047 --> 01:18:27,910
- Sorry about that.

2052
01:18:27,910 --> 01:18:29,014
- So sad.

2053
01:18:29,014 --> 01:18:30,429
- Oh, it's okay, honey.

2054
01:18:30,429 --> 01:18:32,293
We're not missing much.

2055
01:18:32,293 --> 01:18:33,191
- Oh!

2056
01:18:33,191 --> 01:18:34,399
- Oh.

2057
01:18:34,399 --> 01:18:35,469
Maybe missing a
little bit of this.

2058
01:18:35,469 --> 01:18:36,746
I'm gonna show 'em.

2059
01:18:36,746 --> 01:18:37,609
Little bit of this.

2060
01:18:37,609 --> 01:18:38,679
What's up?

2061
01:18:38,679 --> 01:18:39,715
What's up?

2062
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:40,785
Gonna miss that.

2063
01:18:40,785 --> 01:18:42,718
[giggling]

2064
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:44,409
What's up, ladies?

2065
01:18:44,409 --> 01:18:47,584
- See, this is what
I'm talking about.

2066
01:18:51,071 --> 01:18:52,417
- Yeah.

2067
01:18:52,417 --> 01:18:55,247
Well, I usually
get off around 12.

2068
01:18:56,317 --> 01:18:57,146
- Oh.

2069
01:18:58,561 --> 01:19:00,494
- Damn, you're pretty.

2070
01:19:00,494 --> 01:19:02,634
I'm liking this town.

2071
01:19:02,634 --> 01:19:03,773
Another beer?

2072
01:19:05,775 --> 01:19:07,328
- Oh-ho-ho!

2073
01:19:07,328 --> 01:19:08,916
- Look at this.

2074
01:19:08,916 --> 01:19:10,366
Give me some.

2075
01:19:10,366 --> 01:19:11,574
- Not bad.

2076
01:19:11,574 --> 01:19:13,818
- Hey, look who's here!

2077
01:19:13,818 --> 01:19:15,267
Nice one.

2078
01:19:15,267 --> 01:19:16,510
- Hey, guys.

2079
01:19:16,510 --> 01:19:17,753
- How are you?

2080
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:19,651
- Finally made it.
- Yeah! [grunts]

2081
01:19:19,651 --> 01:19:20,928
- All right!

2082
01:19:20,928 --> 01:19:21,757
- [Danny] Oh, boy.

2083
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,413
- Who wants to shag?

2084
01:19:23,413 --> 01:19:24,587
[cheering]

2085
01:19:24,587 --> 01:19:25,761
- [Crowd] Yeah!

2086
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:26,623
- Yes!

2087
01:19:29,488 --> 01:19:31,767
[cheering]

2088
01:19:35,529 --> 01:19:36,772
â™ª I'll wait for you
till I turn blue â™ª

2089
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:37,945
â™ª There's nothin'
more a man can do â™ª

2090
01:19:37,945 --> 01:19:39,498
â™ª Don't get your
bollocks in a twist â™ª

2091
01:19:39,498 --> 01:19:40,914
â™ª Settle down and
don't take a fit â™ª

2092
01:19:40,914 --> 01:19:42,432
â™ª You drank with demons
straight from Hell â™ª

2093
01:19:42,432 --> 01:19:43,779
â™ª They almost
nearly won as well â™ª

2094
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:45,297
â™ª You wiped the
floor with victory â™ª

2095
01:19:45,297 --> 01:19:50,302
â™ª Then puked until
you fell asleep â™ª

2096
01:19:53,098 --> 01:19:54,341
â™ª Blackened was the
banshee's wail â™ª

2097
01:19:54,341 --> 01:19:55,791
â™ª These boots will
never fill her jail â™ª

2098
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,275
â™ª So you crawled
into an empty boat â™ª

2099
01:19:57,275 --> 01:19:58,794
â™ª For the Gulf of Mexico

2100
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:00,381
â™ª Till Cortez came
and when so did you â™ª

2101
01:20:00,381 --> 01:20:01,797
â™ª From the ashes
charred and blue â™ª

2102
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:03,281
â™ª Smellin' like a salty dog

2103
01:20:03,281 --> 01:20:07,457
â™ª Back from hell
where you belong â™ª

2104
01:20:15,362 --> 01:20:16,190
- Whoo!

2105
01:20:17,053 --> 01:20:18,503
[laughing]

2106
01:20:18,503 --> 01:20:19,331
- Yeah!

2107
01:20:19,331 --> 01:20:20,332
Get some shots!

2108
01:20:20,332 --> 01:20:21,161
- Yeah.

2109
01:20:21,161 --> 01:20:21,989
- Ah!

2110
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:25,993
- Welcome to Ireland.

2111
01:20:25,993 --> 01:20:28,099
- I love Ireland.

2112
01:20:28,099 --> 01:20:30,342
[laughing]

2113
01:20:35,796 --> 01:20:38,212
- You're taking him home.

2114
01:20:38,212 --> 01:20:39,765
- Oh no, all right.

2115
01:20:41,353 --> 01:20:43,597
[laughing]

2116
01:20:45,116 --> 01:20:46,289
- Thank you, Jesus.

2117
01:20:46,289 --> 01:20:48,222
[laughing]

2118
01:20:48,222 --> 01:20:49,534
Where's my fuckin' shirt?

2119
01:20:49,534 --> 01:20:51,777
[laughing]

2120
01:20:54,125 --> 01:20:56,713
â™ª Drink, drink, drink

2121
01:20:56,713 --> 01:21:00,510
â™ª To your heart's content

2122
01:21:00,510 --> 01:21:05,481
â™ª Lift that glass in the air

2123
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:08,104
â™ª Drink, drink, drink

2124
01:21:08,104 --> 01:21:11,521
â™ª Only fools lament

2125
01:21:11,521 --> 01:21:16,078
â™ª Over troubles they share

2126
01:21:16,078 --> 01:21:21,083
â™ª Drink, drink,
drink to oblivion â™ª

2127
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:25,950
â™ª For it's now plain to see

2128
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:30,782
â™ª That this glass
I am holding here â™ª

2129
01:21:30,782 --> 01:21:35,614
â™ª Is alone my destiny

2130
01:21:35,614 --> 01:21:37,823
â™ª I don't give a bloody damn

2131
01:21:37,823 --> 01:21:40,309
â™ª What the people think I am

2132
01:21:40,309 --> 01:21:45,003
â™ª Let them know that
this man will be free â™ª

2133
01:21:45,003 --> 01:21:47,454
â™ª Tilt that glass
and slurp that foam â™ª

2134
01:21:47,454 --> 01:21:49,870
â™ª What's the sense
of going home â™ª

2135
01:21:49,870 --> 01:21:54,599
â™ª For the consequence will be

2136
01:21:54,599 --> 01:21:56,428
â™ª Drink, drink, drink

2137
01:21:56,428 --> 01:21:59,397
â™ª Never fear the life

2138
01:21:59,397 --> 01:22:04,126
â™ª That is calling to you

2139
01:22:04,126 --> 01:22:05,921
â™ª Drink, drink, drink

2140
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:08,958
â™ª Let it share the strife

2141
01:22:08,958 --> 01:22:13,963
â™ª That's what drinking can do

2142
01:22:13,963 --> 01:22:16,034
â™ª I don't give a bloody damn

2143
01:22:16,034 --> 01:22:18,588
â™ª What the people think I am

2144
01:22:18,588 --> 01:22:23,352
â™ª Let them know that
this man will be free â™ª

2145
01:22:23,352 --> 01:22:25,768
â™ª Tilt that glass
and slurp that foam â™ª

2146
01:22:25,768 --> 01:22:28,322
â™ª What's the sense
of going home â™ª

2147
01:22:28,322 --> 01:22:33,327
â™ª For the consequence will be

2148
01:22:36,192 --> 01:22:38,332
â™ª Oh, drink, drink, drink

2149
01:22:38,332 --> 01:22:41,991
â™ª To your heart's content

2150
01:22:41,991 --> 01:22:46,892
â™ª Lift that glass in the air

2151
01:22:46,892 --> 01:22:48,687
â™ª Drink, drink, drink

2152
01:22:48,687 --> 01:22:51,725
â™ª Only fools lament

2153
01:22:51,725 --> 01:22:56,178
â™ª Over troubles they share

2154
01:22:56,178 --> 01:23:00,941
â™ª Drink, drink,
drink to oblivion â™ª

2155
01:23:00,941 --> 01:23:05,325
â™ª For it's now plain to see

2156
01:23:05,325 --> 01:23:10,019
â™ª That this glass
I am holding here â™ª

2157
01:23:10,019 --> 01:23:13,195
â™ª Is alone my destiny

2158
01:23:34,285 --> 01:23:36,287
â™ª Last call for alcohol

2159
01:23:36,287 --> 01:23:38,703
â™ª Shake it off
don't lose control â™ª

2160
01:23:38,703 --> 01:23:40,463
â™ª Leave now or don't at all

2161
01:23:40,463 --> 01:23:43,156
â™ª 'Cause we don't want
your money no more â™ª

2162
01:23:43,156 --> 01:23:44,916
â™ª Last chance order up a shot

2163
01:23:44,916 --> 01:23:47,677
â™ª Slim pickins all around
give it what you got â™ª

2164
01:23:47,677 --> 01:23:49,265
â™ª Hurry up drink
a pint or more â™ª

2165
01:23:49,265 --> 01:23:54,270
â™ª The party's heading
out of the door â™ª

2166
01:23:56,583 --> 01:23:58,792
â™ª We don't like you

2167
01:23:58,792 --> 01:24:00,828
â™ª We only want your money

2168
01:24:00,828 --> 01:24:02,934
â™ª We don't hate you

2169
01:24:02,934 --> 01:24:05,109
â™ª Take it all in stride
no need to worry â™ª

2170
01:24:05,109 --> 01:24:09,216
â™ª Our only interest is
the tip that you gave â™ª

2171
01:24:09,216 --> 01:24:14,221
â™ª So finish up, pay your tab
and be on your fuckin' way â™ª

2172
01:24:16,672 --> 01:24:20,020
â™ª Yeah

2173
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:22,781
â™ª Yeah

2174
01:24:22,781 --> 01:24:24,680
â™ª Yeah
