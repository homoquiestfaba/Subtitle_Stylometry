Born in Baton Rouge, the
way to Drexel ...

00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,814

00:00:17,814 --> 00:00:20,727
- The challenger, Chase Perkins!

- David Alexander.

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,567
Who?

10
00:00:32,089 --> 00:00:33,234
you.

11
00:00:33,529 --> 00:00:35,351
This guy was born in 1953.

12
00:00:35,929 --> 00:00:37,465
What, man. They would sell
booze to a baby.

13
00:00:37,465 --> 00:00:38,970
This guy looks like a serial killer.

14
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,912
You look like a David Alexander.

15
00:00:41,658 --> 00:00:43,162
- Okay, fuck it.
- Come, I'll go with you, David.

16
00:00:43,162 --> 00:00:44,569
Come on!

17
00:01:06,141 --> 00:01:07,516
Identity?

18
00:01:12,318 --> 00:01:14,141
Hey, man. Got a light?

19
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,156
Hey.

20
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:18,137
- Yes, of course, here.
- You got a cigarette?

21
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,953
Hey, where you're going, man? Relax.

22
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:27,969
- I'm going back inside.
- What else do you have?

23
00:01:27,969 --> 00:01:29,758
- I do not know what ...
- Has a wallet.

24
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:32,065
Anything else, Mr. Alexander?

25
00:01:32,834 --> 00:01:34,328
- That's all.
- Guys!

26
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,674
- What the hell?
- Guys!

27
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,211
- Get it, get it.
- Give me the damn wallet!

28
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:39,203
Let's go!

29
00:01:39,203 --> 00:01:40,250
But that ...

30
00:01:43,364 --> 00:01:44,925
In at here.

31
00:02:00,775 --> 00:02:02,149
Shit, man.

32
00:02:05,511 --> 00:02:06,886
Hey, man!

33
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,785
Wow, shit, man!

34
00:02:11,336 --> 00:02:13,125
- Call an ambulance!
- And say what?

35
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:15,720
- Where did you get that thing?
- I do not know, it was here

36
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,964
It was on the fucking ground, allright?

37
00:02:22,922 --> 00:02:24,614
- To the ground ! Freeze!
- Hold it!

38
00:02:25,451 --> 00:02:27,115
It's not my gun !
It's not my gun !

39
00:02:27,115 --> 00:02:28,063
- Lower!
- No!

40
00:02:29,162 --> 00:02:30,091
No!

41
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,996
No!

42
00:02:33,996 --> 00:02:35,688
Hold it ! Stay on the ground !

43
00:02:35,853 --> 00:02:38,089
Jake, get down! Jake!

44
00:02:44,366 --> 00:02:46,701
- We did nothing !
- Shut up ! Stay on the ground !

45
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:49,230
Speak to them, Jake!
We did nothing !

46
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,692
Face to the floor, now!

47
00:02:51,246 --> 00:02:53,484
Turn around! Hands back.

48
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:55,365
I'll kill you.

49
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,324
You little shit.

50
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,819
You killed my partner.

51
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:03,663
He is dead. You hear me?

52
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:06,538
I'll kill you, you piece of shit.

53
00:03:07,506 --> 00:03:11,281

Guards!

56
00:03:43,255 --> 00:03:44,880
I have to stop the bleeding.

57
00:03:45,112 --> 00:03:46,803
It'll be okay.

58
00:03:48,184 --> 00:03:49,810
Guards!

00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:05,873
Yes, yes.

61
00:04:06,267 --> 00:04:07,827
Yes, thirty.

62
00:04:07,995 --> 00:04:09,272
Yes, yes.

63
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,640
Ok, ok, ok, ok.

64
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:18,812
Never marry a woman
Puerto Rican.

65
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:22,295
McGwire, right?

66
00:04:22,622 --> 00:04:24,051
Yes, sir.

67
00:04:25,534 --> 00:04:28,285
I'm Ryan Maygold. I'll be
your parole officer.

68
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:31,320
What are you reading?

69
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,661
Melville.

70
00:04:37,184 --> 00:04:38,710
Melville?

71
00:04:39,073 --> 00:04:40,577
"Moby Dick."

72
00:04:40,577 --> 00:04:42,399
on a fish, right?

73
00:04:43,936 --> 00:04:46,817
It says here at the time of your arrest
your were living with your grandmother ...

74
00:04:46,817 --> 00:04:49,206
Dorothy McGwire on Robinson Street.

75
00:04:49,345 --> 00:04:50,524
Have you spoken to her?

76
00:04:50,722 --> 00:04:52,894
She died. Four years ago.

77
00:04:54,754 --> 00:04:56,281
And Connie McGwire?

78
00:04:57,347 --> 00:04:59,998
She moved to California
when I was 12.

79
00:05:03,204 --> 00:05:06,466
Here is a list of places that
the city compiled in 1988.

80
00:05:06,565 --> 00:05:08,421
They were hiring at
the time, then ...

81
00:05:08,805 --> 00:05:09,820
Good luck with that.

82
00:05:12,293 --> 00:05:14,951
The state of Louisiana enacted
a period of parole ...

83
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:17,319
lasting no less than a
year, and no more than three.

84
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:20,456
you are required to to meet with me once a month,
submit to a drug testing ...

85
00:05:20,456 --> 00:05:22,696
live in a half way house.
not being arrested ...

86
00:05:22,696 --> 00:05:24,965
don't blow shit up,
no fly to Yemen.

87
00:05:25,095 --> 00:05:26,755
I'll begin your paperwork ...

88
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:30,536
and if no one sets fire to himself
in the next three hours ...

89
00:05:30,536 --> 00:05:32,359
we should have you processed.

90
00:05:33,258 --> 00:05:34,599
Welcome to the show.

91
00:05:35,337 --> 00:05:37,770
Curfew at 22.30
unless you have ...

92
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,146
a work permit.

93
00:05:39,146 --> 00:05:42,442
No drugs, no booze, no girls.

94
00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:45,674
Last guy left some food.

95
00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:48,747
If the bed is too hard
just call the room service ...

96
00:05:48,747 --> 00:05:49,958
they will send another.

97
00:05:52,364 --> 00:05:54,251
Here you go, man. Good luck

98
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:22,670
- Yes?
- Police open.

99
00:06:24,978 --> 00:06:26,254
hands up.

100
00:06:30,066 --> 00:06:31,343
Welcome back, kid.

101
00:06:32,115 --> 00:06:33,162
What's up?

102
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:35,118
You look good, man.

103
00:06:36,852 --> 00:06:38,706
Still smells like piss in here.

104
00:06:39,604 --> 00:06:41,011
I brought you this.

105
00:06:41,492 --> 00:06:43,631
I know you have nothing when you get out.

106
00:06:45,428 --> 00:06:47,087
- Thanks.
- Yes

107
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,114
Look ...

108
00:06:53,142 --> 00:06:55,052
Sorry not to have come and visit.

109
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,661
I do not know, couldn't take myself
back to those gates, you know?

110
00:07:02,711 --> 00:07:04,664
Man, I can't believe it's you sitting in here.

111
00:07:04,664 --> 00:07:07,480
How often did we dream about this while sitting
in that cage, huh?

112
00:07:08,665 --> 00:07:11,251
- How's work?
- Nothing yet.

113
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:14,260
Yeah. It's quite bleak out here
but I got it.

114
00:07:14,553 --> 00:07:15,863
I talked to my Uncle Lenny ...

115
00:07:16,954 --> 00:07:19,377
he can take you. You know,
he's looking for help.

116
00:07:19,675 --> 00:07:20,919
-Yeah ?
- Yeah.

117
00:07:21,243 --> 00:07:23,130
That'll help a lot.
Thanks, man.

118
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:25,557
Come on. let's go.

119
00:07:27,387 --> 00:07:28,435
Where?

120
00:07:29,564 --> 00:07:31,387
I wanna see if you still got it

121
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,696
Hey, Don, started yet ?

122
00:07:49,696 --> 00:07:51,386
- Second round, man.
- Beautiful.

123
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,720
Let's welcome these two fighters.
Come on, make some noise!

124
00:08:02,337 --> 00:08:04,834
I want to remind you that we do
this every Friday night ...

125
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:06,111
Here in Texas Club.

126
00:08:06,594 --> 00:08:07,936
Bayou's fights !

127
00:08:08,258 --> 00:08:09,632
What is this ?

128
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,619
this's the minor leagues.

129
00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:13,795
See what happens in these
cages, and see what I'm talking about.

130
00:08:13,795 --> 00:08:15,356
Ready for round two.

131
00:08:20,484 --> 00:08:21,466
You ready?

132
00:08:21,636 --> 00:08:22,914
You ready?

133
00:08:23,141 --> 00:08:24,123
Fight!

134
00:08:30,406 --> 00:08:31,814
this is legit'?

135
00:08:31,814 --> 00:08:33,985
Yes, they bring in 5000 dollars a week.

136
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,134
That's not counting the side action.

137
00:08:42,632 --> 00:08:45,632
I have a system that breaks down each fighter's strengths
and weaknesses.

138
00:08:46,152 --> 00:08:47,167
foolproof.

139
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,799
Thank you. I'll get you back.

140
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,123
Here. To the rise of the employ.

141
00:08:57,834 --> 00:08:59,907
I know that guy. the black in the corner.

142
00:09:01,451 --> 00:09:03,242
He a monster.

143
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,876
We were in high school together. He was a great wrestler.

144
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:06,152
He is.

145
00:09:08,076 --> 00:09:09,637
He has a lot of respect around here.

146
00:09:21,678 --> 00:09:23,052
- Who was that?
- Who?

147
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:24,776
The big guy.

148
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:27,214
Ace Reed. He thinks he's Stringer Bell.

149
00:09:27,439 --> 00:09:30,156
- Who?
- Stringer Bell. From "The Wire."

150
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,009
He sells a lot of coke.

151
00:09:32,368 --> 00:09:34,889
- And the cops ?
- You've got to pay your taxes.

152
00:09:35,088 --> 00:09:36,463
Hey, Rix, how do you feel ?

153
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:41,000
Always bet on Jim LA's horse.

154
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:43,729
He used to be a number one contender
until he blew his leg.

155
00:09:43,729 --> 00:09:44,778
Come on.

156
00:10:00,244 --> 00:10:02,830
Hey, Larry! What's the deal?

157
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:10,064
Give me two out and one on Tim money

158
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:15,825
Come on! Come on!

159
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:21,041
Two hundred! This system right there!

160
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,901
can't do, Jake. can't do.

161
00:10:23,032 --> 00:10:25,144
You can't do what? I've not fucking greased up yet.

162
00:10:25,144 --> 00:10:27,065
Ace's calling the chips,
you have no more credit.

163
00:10:27,065 --> 00:10:28,025
Oh, come on.

164
00:10:28,025 --> 00:10:29,848
I should not even be paying
you on this fight.

165
00:10:31,033 --> 00:10:32,179
Sorry, Jake.

166
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:36,954
are you allright?

167
00:10:36,954 --> 00:10:39,291
Yes Larry hasn't been the same since
his wife left him ...

168
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,818
'cause he has a small pecker.

169
00:10:41,563 --> 00:10:42,741
Truth hurts.

170
00:10:44,188 --> 00:10:45,497
Your winner ...

171
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,730
Now with a record of 9 to 4 ...

172
00:10:50,909 --> 00:10:53,876
Ray Smithies!

173
00:10:54,493 --> 00:10:55,606
Justin, Justin!

174
00:10:55,773 --> 00:10:57,017
Hey, tough break, man.

175
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,379
You know my boy, Dillon McGwire?

176
00:11:00,862 --> 00:11:03,231
Sure. How you man doing, eh?

177
00:11:03,231 --> 00:11:05,369
'm allright. you did well in there.

178
00:11:05,471 --> 00:11:07,927
just lost focus, man. just one second.

179
00:11:08,352 --> 00:11:09,562
you know how it is.

180
00:11:10,016 --> 00:11:12,799
just as wrestling. Except you get to punch the guy.

181
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,775
- Well, it was a hell of a fight, man.
-.

182
00:11:16,225 --> 00:11:18,624
- I warned you about the reverse, didn't I ?
- I thought ...

183
00:11:18,624 --> 00:11:20,894
No, no, no. You don't think, you do.

184
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:23,554
You do what I say, then you win.

185
00:11:23,554 --> 00:11:25,944
When you do what you think, you fuckin'  lose.

186
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:27,395
Look what happened.

187
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,784
You had it in position,
right? What did I say?

188
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:33,091
I said : "stay close,
elbow !". didn't I ?

189
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:35,775
What did you do? You sat straight up and got reverse.

190
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:38,074
And threw away a lot of money here.

191
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,587
It cost me big.

192
00:11:43,206 --> 00:11:46,554
Your cut.. Your  cage fee's mine.
You have a nice day.

193
00:11:49,446 --> 00:11:52,315
Hey! We gonna work on that nose or what?

194
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,272
Come on, let's get out of here.

195
00:11:54,663 --> 00:11:56,224
Good to see you, man.

196
00:11:56,487 --> 00:11:57,916
Hang in there, Justin.

197
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:03,944
Wait, wait. Where are you going?

198
00:12:04,137 --> 00:12:05,511
Curfew.

199
00:12:05,736 --> 00:12:08,771
Oh, man. I know that was tough
to watch, but ...

200
00:12:09,065 --> 00:12:11,432
But, you know, Justin
has a point.

201
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,865
You'd be a monster in that cage.

202
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,642
didn't look much
like wrestling to me...

203
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,627
You were All American, you were national
champion. I mean ...

204
00:12:19,627 --> 00:12:21,291
we'd make a lot of scratch
if you'd be fighting.

205
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,463
- We?
- I saw scouts in there.

206
00:12:23,852 --> 00:12:26,754
USMMA, Crush, UFC.

207
00:12:27,244 --> 00:12:30,509
We could run for it. I could be your manager.
I Could help you train.

208
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:31,853
It's not for me, man.

209
00:12:31,853 --> 00:12:33,453
Ah, come on, man, it's just...

210
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:37,196
it's wrestling mixed with
a little bit of punching

211
00:12:39,213 --> 00:12:41,102
You are the best wrestler in the world.

212
00:12:41,615 --> 00:12:43,175
I gotta get going.

213
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:47,088
it's cool, man. Stay and
watch the fights.

214
00:12:47,088 --> 00:12:48,266
Allright, see you in the morning?

215
00:12:49,392 --> 00:12:51,115
I'll give you a lift to work.

216
00:12:51,536 --> 00:12:53,839
- Thanks, but I think ...
- Hey, hey, it's legit.

217
00:12:54,001 --> 00:12:55,626
I'm just gonna take you down there.

218
00:12:55,985 --> 00:12:57,741
Text me when you're ready.

219
00:12:58,994 --> 00:13:00,401
Text ?

220
00:13:01,362 --> 00:13:04,659
Forget it, Rip Van Winkle. A lot
has changed since you've been inside.

221
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,960
Why just not be ready for 08h00 ?

222
00:13:08,147 --> 00:13:09,324
Allright.

223
00:13:09,907 --> 00:13:11,118
Hey.

224
00:13:13,075 --> 00:13:14,636
Welcome back, kid.

225
00:13:39,128 --> 00:13:41,049
- Police! On the floor!
- What?

226
00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:42,390
I said now!

227
00:13:44,984 --> 00:13:47,641
- You holding ha? ?
- No!

228
00:13:47,641 --> 00:13:49,015
How are you doing, partner?

229
00:13:49,754 --> 00:13:52,405
Remember me? I
bet you do.

230
00:13:54,874 --> 00:13:56,019
There it is.

231
00:13:57,915 --> 00:14:00,316
Oh sorry ! That is Detective Spencer.

232
00:14:00,316 --> 00:14:02,811
We thought we'd just come by
and say welcome back.

233
00:14:02,811 --> 00:14:03,964
Welcome, douche bag.

234
00:14:03,964 --> 00:14:08,380
You know, I think it's great you and Jakey
are still together after all these years.

235
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,557
You two are regular Bonnie and Clyde.

236
00:14:10,557 --> 00:14:11,838
Tell me something ...

237
00:14:11,838 --> 00:14:13,789
those three extra years you had ...

238
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:16,572
was it hard to be away from
your boyfriend all that time?

239
00:14:17,118 --> 00:14:18,525
I bet it was.

240
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,711
But that's what you get when you breaks
a guy's neck.

241
00:14:27,872 --> 00:14:29,814
I owe you

242
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,388
See you later.

243
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:31,968
BEVERAGES, WINE
COLD BEER

244
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,634
This it it.

245
00:15:42,636 --> 00:15:45,604
are you serious ?
A liquor store?

246
00:15:46,637 --> 00:15:48,546
Hey, it's a job, get over it.

247
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:50,157
He knows that you are coming.

248
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,913
Tell him that you talked to me.

249
00:15:52,109 --> 00:15:53,735
What, you're not coming in?

250
00:15:53,837 --> 00:15:56,107
No, I got some business across
town.

251
00:15:59,086 --> 00:16:01,476
you're good, don't worry about it.
Everything is set up.

252
00:16:19,922 --> 00:16:21,132
Can I help you ?

253
00:16:22,802 --> 00:16:25,585
Yes I'm Dillon.
Jake's friend.

254
00:16:26,739 --> 00:16:28,243
Yes?

255
00:16:28,243 --> 00:16:30,283
He said he might
have a job.

256
00:16:30,804 --> 00:16:31,819
Yes.

257
00:16:35,188 --> 00:16:36,340
I can come back later.

258
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,992
- Can you lift 30 pound boxes?
- Yes

259
00:16:39,413 --> 00:16:41,649
What does it say on the box behind you?

260
00:16:43,798 --> 00:16:45,621
- Vodka?
- Allright.

261
00:16:45,814 --> 00:16:48,567
I can give you two nights
and two days, will that work?

262
00:16:48,567 --> 00:16:50,422
Yes That would be great.

263
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:52,213
Good

264
00:16:53,623 --> 00:16:54,680
When shall I start?

265
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,527
You can move those boxes in the back next to the rhum.

266
00:17:09,881 --> 00:17:10,994
Hey, Len.

267
00:17:13,787 --> 00:17:14,899
Sorry.

268
00:17:15,515 --> 00:17:16,627
Amy?

269
00:17:18,812 --> 00:17:21,529
- it's been a long time.
- Yes

270
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,380
Looks like you put your time to good use.

271
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,874
you are a doctor now?

272
00:17:28,476 --> 00:17:30,616
I am looking for my Uncle Lenny.

273
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:34,038
- Hey.
- Hey.

274
00:17:35,775 --> 00:17:37,563
- How was class?
- It was good.

275
00:17:38,463 --> 00:17:41,567
I just wanted to stop by and see
if you had eaten anything today.

276
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:44,218
- I'm not really hungry.
- Well, you have to eat.

277
00:17:44,415 --> 00:17:45,600
Let's go at Ann Marie's.

278
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,219
- I got to close up.
- All right, I can wait.

279
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,631
Hey Dillon, come here.

280
00:17:55,585 --> 00:17:57,691
Here. That's for today.

281
00:17:58,145 --> 00:18:01,954
Now, buy some black pants,
a couple collar shirts.

282
00:18:01,954 --> 00:18:04,442
When tomorrow comes, fill
in a time card.

283
00:18:04,931 --> 00:18:06,655
Payday's every Friday.

284
00:18:07,747 --> 00:18:09,089
Thank you.

285
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:20,837
I can't believeyou let Dillon
McGwire work here.

286
00:18:20,837 --> 00:18:22,117
He did his time.

287
00:18:22,117 --> 00:18:24,453
Did Jake make you do this?

288
00:18:24,934 --> 00:18:27,901
- Everybody's gotta eat.
- What's that supposed to mean?

289
00:18:28,391 --> 00:18:30,780
It means I'm starving. Let's go.

290
00:18:51,947 --> 00:18:53,638
- Sorry to have come here.
- Stop.

291
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:55,296
The fight is tonight.

292
00:18:55,691 --> 00:18:56,747
Is that the Delaudid?

293
00:18:56,747 --> 00:18:58,374
- Who is it?
- What?

294
00:18:59,276 --> 00:19:00,395
Who do you owe now?

295
00:19:00,395 --> 00:19:02,156
What ?  I need to pay rent.

296
00:19:02,156 --> 00:19:03,619
Who?

297
00:19:05,069 --> 00:19:06,279
Ace.

298
00:19:07,661 --> 00:19:08,749
are you kidding me?

299
00:19:08,749 --> 00:19:10,670
Relax, sis, I have
it under control.

300
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,847
you have it under control?

301
00:19:12,334 --> 00:19:14,472
- What the hell are you doing?
- That's the last time.

302
00:19:14,766 --> 00:19:16,457
You are unbelievable.

303
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:21,260
I'll be home early, right?
Do not worry.

304
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,324
I've got it.

305
00:19:31,024 --> 00:19:32,006
Shit!

306
00:19:32,978 --> 00:19:33,926
Jake!

307
00:19:34,386 --> 00:19:35,466
My God.

308
00:19:43,027 --> 00:19:44,009
Lenny!

309
00:19:45,972 --> 00:19:47,182
Lenny!

310
00:19:47,892 --> 00:19:49,070
Lenny!

311
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:58,165
- You are well?
- Have you seen my uncle?

312
00:19:58,165 --> 00:19:59,692
He went out. What's wrong?

313
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:05,136
They took Jake.

314
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:06,550
Who?

315
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,438
- Ace.
- Ace Reed?

316
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:10,964
Jake owes him a lot of money.

317
00:20:12,856 --> 00:20:15,726
I waited in the house because
I thought that they might... but...

318
00:20:16,056 --> 00:20:18,096
- I can't go to the cops.
- Allright, Allright.

319
00:20:18,296 --> 00:20:20,053
Right. How do I find Ace?

320
00:20:21,657 --> 00:20:23,828
He has this place on Choctaw.

321
00:20:29,531 --> 00:20:30,522
Can you take me there?

322
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:32,411
- you can't just walk in there ...
- Please.

323
00:20:32,571 --> 00:20:33,978
Just take me there.

324
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,667
Okay, go home.

325
00:20:43,196 --> 00:20:44,658
What are you gonna do?

326
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,417
It's gonna be okay.

327
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:49,492
Go home.

328
00:20:56,607 --> 00:20:58,298
I'm here to see the Ace.

329
00:21:45,415 --> 00:21:46,822
How much does he owe ?

330
00:21:46,822 --> 00:21:48,285
Hey. How much?

331
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,647
How much?

332
00:21:53,223 --> 00:21:54,631
Twenty.

333
00:21:54,825 --> 00:21:57,312
Twenty thousand. Got it?

334
00:21:58,921 --> 00:22:00,744
It doesn't look like he has that long...

335
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:06,239
There's only two ways he's rollin' outta here.

336
00:22:06,603 --> 00:22:09,417
Dog food or my cash.

337
00:22:10,474 --> 00:22:12,002
I'll pay it.

338
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:13,995
I'll pay the twenty thousand.

339
00:22:13,995 --> 00:22:16,171
No. Interest.

340
00:22:16,171 --> 00:22:17,634
It's thirty.

341
00:22:19,564 --> 00:22:20,742
Fine.

342
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,541
What are you two - like lovers or something?
It's gotta be love.

343
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,717
- I'm gonna need some time.
- No, partner.

344
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,640
ain't no layout plan

345
00:22:30,094 --> 00:22:32,396
I need my cash,
and need it now.

346
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,254
I will fight.

347
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,971
- At the Texas Club.
- At the Texas ...

348
00:22:41,872 --> 00:22:44,016
No, they don't pay like that down there.

349
00:22:44,016 --> 00:22:45,744
What will you make? like a thousand  a win?

350
00:22:45,744 --> 00:22:47,752
Not if you bet on me.

351
00:22:47,921 --> 00:22:49,743
Hey. He's the best.

352
00:22:50,065 --> 00:22:51,374
He was All American.

353
00:22:52,209 --> 00:22:53,426
- Fuck !
- You know what?

354
00:22:53,426 --> 00:22:56,077
- I'm gonna kill your ass right now.
- Then you don't get paid pay.

355
00:22:58,386 --> 00:22:59,914
I'll win.

356
00:23:00,051 --> 00:23:01,774
It's on me.

357
00:23:04,211 --> 00:23:05,739
I know you.

358
00:23:06,324 --> 00:23:09,226
- Where do I know you from?
- We went to high school together.

359
00:23:10,837 --> 00:23:13,172
Yes You the wrestler that has
killed the guy.

360
00:23:15,189 --> 00:23:17,557
You know what? Let's do it.

361
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,317
This should be fun.

362
00:23:19,926 --> 00:23:22,065
Three fights. That's what you owe.

363
00:23:22,263 --> 00:23:24,567
You win me three fights and we're good.

364
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:27,763
You lose... you, you ...

365
00:23:28,055 --> 00:23:30,990
and that trim you rolled up with ...
gonna get dead.

366
00:23:31,063 --> 00:23:32,492
Are we clear?

367
00:23:33,239 --> 00:23:35,280
- I said, are we clear?
- We're clear.

368
00:23:38,201 --> 00:23:39,444
Cut him down.

369
00:23:49,691 --> 00:23:51,961
Let me see him. Let me
see him. Come on.

370
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,332
- Oh my God.
- No, no, no.

371
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:55,379
Come on.

372
00:23:55,612 --> 00:23:57,172
I'll have to clean it up.

373
00:23:57,533 --> 00:23:58,777
Let me see.

374
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,828
The "Kid" est back.

375
00:24:18,752 --> 00:24:21,152
it's not just wrestling. You have
to keep your hands up.

376
00:24:21,152 --> 00:24:22,432
You've got to keep your head in it.

377
00:24:22,432 --> 00:24:24,188
Don't get pressed against the cage.

378
00:24:43,268 --> 00:24:45,476
breathe in now, just breathe, just breathe.

379
00:24:45,476 --> 00:24:47,102
You're good. you're good

380
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:51,265
Okay,Listen to me. If you get
on top, follow through.

381
00:24:51,397 --> 00:24:54,117
fist, elbow, fist,
elbow. But hey ...

382
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,877
don't make it about the punches, right?

383
00:24:55,877 --> 00:24:58,660
Use wrestling. Find
leverage, take him down.

384
00:24:58,854 --> 00:25:00,582
Remember the knee bar
that showed you?

385
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:01,606
Remember the neck crank?

386
00:25:01,606 --> 00:25:03,876
Remember all that?
Hey! you good ?

387
00:25:07,783 --> 00:25:09,606
Come on, I'll fix you up ok?

388
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,049
Look at me. No worry
about it. Focus.

389
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:18,441
You Philly the Kid, baby. You
Philly the Kid, right?

390
00:25:18,441 --> 00:25:21,312
Philly ... the Kid, Dillon McGwire!

391
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,448
Shirt.

392
00:25:36,972 --> 00:25:38,860
Okay, rookie, only two rules.

393
00:25:39,053 --> 00:25:42,468
One,someone taps out, you go to
your corner, fight's over.

394
00:25:42,733 --> 00:25:44,938
Second rule, don't die on me, bro.

395
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:47,812
I've got a lot more fights after this.

396
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:57,096
- Whose that?
- Mine.

397
00:26:10,801 --> 00:26:11,881
Gentlemen.

398
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,051
Listen to me, it's three
three minute rounds.

399
00:26:16,051 --> 00:26:17,715
If I call it,we're done.

400
00:26:17,715 --> 00:26:19,571
If the bell rings, we're done. Understood?

401
00:26:20,147 --> 00:26:21,427
Ok. Touch gloves.

402
00:26:21,427 --> 00:26:23,183
In your corners, wait for my signal.

403
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,453
Hey, keep your hands up.

404
00:26:26,453 --> 00:26:29,202
He will want to get on top, ok? Take get at him.

405
00:26:30,324 --> 00:26:31,274
You ready?

406
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,625
You ready?

407
00:26:33,845 --> 00:26:34,827
Fight!

408
00:26:40,055 --> 00:26:41,615
Keep your hands up, Dillon!

409
00:26:53,336 --> 00:26:54,548
Come on!

410
00:26:59,193 --> 00:27:00,885
Come on!

411
00:27:05,594 --> 00:27:06,675
Hands up!

412
00:27:34,367 --> 00:27:35,456
Come on!

413
00:27:35,456 --> 00:27:37,844
And that's the end of round one.

414
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:40,663
We'll be back at the beginning
of round two.

415
00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:44,511
Open, open.

416
00:27:49,026 --> 00:27:49,974
You good?

417
00:27:52,577 --> 00:27:54,007
D, you good?

418
00:28:20,294 --> 00:28:21,277
You ready?

419
00:28:21,511 --> 00:28:22,591
You ready?

420
00:28:22,888 --> 00:28:24,000
Fight!

421
00:29:21,489 --> 00:29:22,471
Finished!

422
00:29:23,985 --> 00:29:25,360
Finished!

423
00:29:33,971 --> 00:29:36,273
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

424
00:29:37,203 --> 00:29:38,515
you allright ?

425
00:29:38,515 --> 00:29:40,660
Look at me. Ok, let's get out.

426
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,864
Let's go, let's
go. Come on.

427
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:53,323
The winner, Dillon McGwire!

428
00:29:59,126 --> 00:30:00,239
you allright?

429
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:01,717
you good ?

430
00:30:02,807 --> 00:30:04,084
What you're fuckin' lookin' at?

431
00:30:07,511 --> 00:30:08,440
Come on.

432
00:30:09,944 --> 00:30:12,400
It's not the worst thing I've ever seen.

433
00:30:13,209 --> 00:30:14,868
But I can't stitch it.

434
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,569
Keep it clean.

435
00:30:16,569 --> 00:30:18,936
And if it swells too much, get it looked at.

436
00:30:19,737 --> 00:30:21,942
- Thanks.
- Thanks, Doc.

437
00:30:22,395 --> 00:30:25,078
Was I right? Huh?
was I right?

438
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:28,211
Tell me ...

439
00:30:28,764 --> 00:30:30,193
Why'd you bite your tongue?

440
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,820
Football coaches
down South ...

441
00:30:33,084 --> 00:30:36,662
teach your players to bite
alngua before blocking punds.

442
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:39,326
The blood drives them
crazy on adrenalin ...

443
00:30:39,326 --> 00:30:41,150
but also scares the shit
out of the other team.

444
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,900
But I've got a pretty good feeling
you knew that already.

445
00:30:46,238 --> 00:30:47,896
Bring him by my place tomorrow.

446
00:30:53,567 --> 00:30:54,778
What did I tell you?

447
00:30:54,879 --> 00:30:56,000
One fight.

448
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,349
One fight and LA Jim wants to talk to you.

449
00:31:00,448 --> 00:31:03,068
That's what I'm talking about, baby.
That's what I'm talking about.

450
00:31:03,138 --> 00:31:04,512
No laying, huh?

451
00:31:05,729 --> 00:31:07,835
You're a mean son of a bitch.

452
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:11,297
I like it though.

453
00:31:11,714 --> 00:31:13,242
I like that a lot.

454
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,231
Jake.

455
00:31:16,195 --> 00:31:17,886
Get him another fight.

456
00:31:20,452 --> 00:31:21,532
Quick.

457
00:31:22,916 --> 00:31:24,260
Keep your head up straight.

458
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,650
Just two more and we're through. We clear ?

459
00:31:28,517 --> 00:31:30,240
I said, are we clear ?

460
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,244
Wild man.

461
00:31:37,447 --> 00:31:39,105
Take care of my horse, Jake.

462
00:31:39,655 --> 00:31:40,997
See you soon.

463
00:32:13,421 --> 00:32:14,501
here?

464
00:32:14,637 --> 00:32:16,131
Pope polish?

465
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:18,382
Trust me. This guy's the real deal.

466
00:32:18,382 --> 00:32:21,164
Here. That's for your win
last night.

467
00:32:32,624 --> 00:32:33,900
Big time.

468
00:32:35,216 --> 00:32:37,769
Hey, guys. Thanks for coming down.

469
00:32:38,096 --> 00:32:39,024
No problem.

470
00:32:39,024 --> 00:32:40,496
Why don't you and I take a walk ?

471
00:32:40,496 --> 00:32:43,116
- Murray has some papers for you to sign.
- Hey.

472
00:32:43,825 --> 00:32:45,319
saw you came from Drexel.

473
00:32:45,937 --> 00:32:47,148
You are good.

474
00:32:48,147 --> 00:32:51,408
Last night you were something
... different.

475
00:32:52,658 --> 00:32:55,441
- How long a strech did you do ?
- Ten years.

476
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:59,370
You know what I do ?

477
00:32:59,669 --> 00:33:01,611
- Train fighters.
- No.

478
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,885
I Train the best.

479
00:33:04,436 --> 00:33:07,852
And the best all have that animal
I saw in you last night.

480
00:33:07,989 --> 00:33:09,298
But that's not enough.

481
00:33:09,461 --> 00:33:11,350
See, right now you can get on the ground with anyone.

482
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,876
you just can't get him there.

483
00:33:13,142 --> 00:33:15,531
You've gotta learn how to stand up and fight.

484
00:33:16,118 --> 00:33:17,875
Become a complete fighter.

485
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:21,839
'cos that's what separates
the street rats from the best.

486
00:33:22,776 --> 00:33:24,117
You gotta want it.

487
00:33:25,496 --> 00:33:27,121
Or eventually ...

488
00:33:28,345 --> 00:33:29,970
You won't walk out

489
00:33:33,753 --> 00:33:36,023
Remember when everyone
used to know his name?

490
00:33:36,218 --> 00:33:37,974
"Dillon, you the man!"

491
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:42,935
You train with me and I'll get
you back there.

492
00:33:43,835 --> 00:33:46,105
- What's in it for you ?
- Twenty percent.

493
00:33:46,236 --> 00:33:48,243
You fight who I say
when I say.

494
00:33:49,051 --> 00:33:50,428
I don't think I'm in the fighter
you are looking for.

495
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:51,923
Well, I don't know if you are either.

496
00:33:52,317 --> 00:33:55,284
But after what I saw last
night, and from what I know ...

497
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:57,844
I think you owe to yourself to find out.

498
00:34:01,086 --> 00:34:02,514
When do we start ?

499
00:34:04,479 --> 00:34:06,518
- You've got a girl?
- No.

500
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:08,925
Go get one tonight.

501
00:34:10,368 --> 00:34:12,954
'cause tomorrow, your legs are mine.

502
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,281
Girls are like kryptonite
to legs.

503
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:19,285
7am tomorrow morning.

504
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,277
Make sure you eat something before.

505
00:34:28,451 --> 00:34:29,628
What did he say?

506
00:34:30,531 --> 00:34:32,636
- Eat breakfast.
- What else?

507
00:34:33,444 --> 00:34:34,691
And to get laid.

508
00:34:34,691 --> 00:34:36,349
That's what I'm talking about!

509
00:34:36,484 --> 00:34:38,338
- Here.
- What's that?

510
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,850
You now belong LA Jim Inc. Management

511
00:34:48,037 --> 00:34:50,012
Hey huh, how's the fishing?

512
00:34:50,982 --> 00:34:52,967
Relax. it's just a job check.

513
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:55,301
A little like a prostate check,
but without the lube.

514
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:57,220
I brought coffee.

515
00:35:03,112 --> 00:35:04,771
What happened to your knuckles?

516
00:35:09,129 --> 00:35:10,722
Loading boxes?

517
00:35:11,657 --> 00:35:12,770
Yes.

518
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:15,618
you've loaded boxes with
your face, too?

519
00:35:17,931 --> 00:35:20,203
So, do you need to talk to
my boss or something?

520
00:35:20,203 --> 00:35:21,414
No.

521
00:35:21,483 --> 00:35:23,305
Just checking a box here.

522
00:35:27,436 --> 00:35:29,705
- How are you doing?
- Here?

523
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:32,549
Here, there, everywhere.
How's the world?

524
00:35:33,677 --> 00:35:34,822
It's fine.

525
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,459
It's different.

526
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,113
Did four in Iraq.

527
00:35:43,631 --> 00:35:46,730
Came home, felt like I'd
been to Mars and back.

528
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:50,476
Give it time.

529
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,069
Find something that matters.
Hold on tight.

530
00:35:55,056 --> 00:35:56,748
Look what it did for me, right?

531
00:35:58,993 --> 00:36:00,487
Allright.

532
00:36:00,881 --> 00:36:02,092
Back to work.

533
00:36:02,642 --> 00:36:04,781
- Next time?
- Yes

534
00:36:07,507 --> 00:36:09,034
Watch out for them boxes.

535
00:36:22,772 --> 00:36:23,787
Hi

536
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:27,573
Sorry, sorry. I didn't want
to surprise you.

537
00:36:27,573 --> 00:36:29,678
- it's all right, i've got it.
- No, let me help you.

538
00:36:30,294 --> 00:36:32,662
Gotta stop entering in the
back like a criminal.

539
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:34,987
Shit, sorry.

540
00:36:36,535 --> 00:36:38,030
Your uncle isn't here.

541
00:36:41,335 --> 00:36:42,962
No, actually ...

542
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,709
I never got to say ...

543
00:36:47,513 --> 00:36:48,942
Thank you.

544
00:36:53,401 --> 00:36:55,507
- I heard you won.
- Yes

545
00:36:59,066 --> 00:37:01,042
I'm sorry that he
did this to you.

546
00:37:01,307 --> 00:37:02,736
it's allright.

547
00:37:02,811 --> 00:37:04,185
No it's not.

548
00:37:04,795 --> 00:37:06,771
I'll just do it for him.

549
00:37:07,932 --> 00:37:11,544
Hey, at least I wasn't asked
to win a beauty pageant.

550
00:37:14,718 --> 00:37:17,139
So, is it true what my
brother told me?

551
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,152
- You never lost?
- Yeah.

552
00:37:20,574 --> 00:37:22,101
You must be pretty good.

553
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,217
You should come and watch.

554
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,363
I don't really like fighting.

555
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,702
Well, I gotta go. I have
to catch the bus.

556
00:37:34,976 --> 00:37:37,017
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

557
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:42,778
- How about Italian food?
- What ?

558
00:37:43,106 --> 00:37:45,528
- Do you like Italian food?
- Yes

559
00:37:45,954 --> 00:37:49,751
Because I'm about to close up here and there's
this really great place up on Eliyson.

560
00:37:51,106 --> 00:37:53,628
That place hasn't been up there
for like, five years.

561
00:37:56,772 --> 00:37:58,812
But there's this great place on Broad.

562
00:38:21,544 --> 00:38:24,392
Hey, man, It's me.
You're missing your party.

563
00:38:24,968 --> 00:38:27,816
I know you're not working right now,
because I know you're closed.

564
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:30,600
So, er, get your ass down here.

565
00:38:34,922 --> 00:38:37,027
It is a celebration.

566
00:38:50,925 --> 00:38:52,355
Look at this nut.

567
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:55,946
No work, no technique.
The guy's an amateur.

568
00:38:58,222 --> 00:38:59,531
What a hack.

569
00:39:00,142 --> 00:39:03,182
They got this guy, Powell, fighting
sticks so that they can build ...

570
00:39:03,182 --> 00:39:06,118
- A money horse.
- Hey! Turn that shit off!

571
00:39:07,535 --> 00:39:09,675
It's the guy who stays on his feet who wins.

572
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,389
It's the guy can still punch while
the other can't breathe.

573
00:39:15,921 --> 00:39:19,237
Oh, I'm sorry,can I get you
a lemonade or something?

574
00:39:19,601 --> 00:39:21,162
Hit that fucking thing!

575
00:39:21,362 --> 00:39:22,922
A hundred times! Let's go!

576
00:39:24,947 --> 00:39:26,931
- What do winners never do?
- Quit !

577
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:27,913
Hit it!

578
00:39:29,715 --> 00:39:30,642
Now!

579
00:39:31,251 --> 00:39:32,560
Aim for the head!

580
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:45,418
Now!

581
00:40:09,625 --> 00:40:11,000
Get some rest.

582
00:40:13,402 --> 00:40:14,680
That's good.

583
00:40:15,867 --> 00:40:16,815
Now!

584
00:40:17,531 --> 00:40:18,513
this is it.

585
00:40:35,901 --> 00:40:36,883
Now!

586
00:40:44,799 --> 00:40:46,360
Ok, again!

587
00:40:51,201 --> 00:40:52,695
Ace's gotta approve it.

588
00:40:53,088 --> 00:40:55,063
Fuck Ace, ok?

589
00:40:55,361 --> 00:40:57,084
I'm not playing on credit.

590
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:58,168
Take this.

591
00:40:58,561 --> 00:41:01,050
That's two thousand dollars
on my boy tomorrow.

592
00:41:01,315 --> 00:41:04,576
You hold onto it. I win, you pay
me what you owe me.

593
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:06,685
Ace doesn't need to know.

594
00:41:06,786 --> 00:41:08,096
Leave it off the books.

595
00:41:08,836 --> 00:41:11,291
Larry, you need these ears.

596
00:41:11,876 --> 00:41:14,692
I know these fighters. I know
what your odds should be. Come on.

597
00:41:14,692 --> 00:41:16,580
You help
me, I help you.

598
00:41:21,413 --> 00:41:23,650
- What's that?
- Oh My God.

599
00:41:24,711 --> 00:41:25,823
What ?

600
00:41:25,927 --> 00:41:27,715
O-M-G, that's what it means.

601
00:41:29,094 --> 00:41:31,070
OMG, I just sent my first text.

602
00:41:36,616 --> 00:41:37,598
McGwire.

603
00:41:37,864 --> 00:41:39,969
You really want to give me an excuse?

604
00:41:43,945 --> 00:41:45,222
What are you doing?

605
00:41:45,449 --> 00:41:48,362
- Hey, easy playboy.
- We didn't do anything !

606
00:41:48,362 --> 00:41:51,974
While I'm here, I want to give congratulations
on your big win. that's all.

607
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:54,789
I hear you're with LA Jim now.
That's terrific.

608
00:41:55,467 --> 00:41:58,369
Just want to make sure
you don't get the big head.

609
00:41:59,659 --> 00:42:01,416
You still a piece of shit.

610
00:42:05,484 --> 00:42:07,111
- Fuck it!
- Easy, killer.

611
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:09,353
Those fighters.

612
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,427
They fight for me down there.

613
00:42:11,758 --> 00:42:14,125
Every breath you take in that ring ...

614
00:42:14,189 --> 00:42:16,131
That's a gift from ... me.

615
00:42:20,015 --> 00:42:21,738
Enjoy the rest of your evening.

616
00:42:23,247 --> 00:42:25,003
Keep 'em gloves up !

617
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,385
- No.
- I'm sorry.

618
00:42:34,033 --> 00:42:36,554
- Are you ok ? Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

619
00:42:44,947 --> 00:42:47,533
Yes, that's ok. Snap it. Snap it.

620
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:49,739
nice.

621
00:42:52,563 --> 00:42:54,549
Well, don't think, react.

622
00:42:54,549 --> 00:42:55,726
that's it.

623
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,780
Break. Break !

624
00:43:01,974 --> 00:43:03,151
It's training.

625
00:43:05,046 --> 00:43:06,421
He's ready.

626
00:43:13,111 --> 00:43:14,420
Come on. Come on.

627
00:43:14,935 --> 00:43:15,950
that's it.

628
00:43:17,592 --> 00:43:19,316
Yes, good.

629
00:43:19,544 --> 00:43:21,748
Quick. The other hand.

630

For luck.

633
00:43:49,213 --> 00:43:50,457
How's he looking ?

634
00:43:50,877 --> 00:43:52,438
He's looking ready.

635
00:43:53,342 --> 00:43:54,487
What does that mean?

636
00:43:54,686 --> 00:43:57,272
It means you should get ready
To pay up.

637
00:43:57,471 --> 00:43:58,878
Bring the pain, man.

638
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,741
Hey, listen. listen.

639
00:44:07,232 --> 00:44:09,217
This jock will come up all flashy.

640
00:44:09,217 --> 00:44:10,591
Let him wear himself down.

641
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:13,217
When I say "now", I want you
to hit it him so hard ...

642
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:14,678
... that his kids will be pissing blood.

643
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:27,578
Gentlemen.

I call it, we're done.

646
00:44:34,917 --> 00:44:36,127
Understand?

647
00:44:36,261 --> 00:44:39,393
Good. Touch gloves, go to your
corner, wait for my signal.

648
00:44:40,518 --> 00:44:41,565

649
00:44:41,894 --> 00:44:43,203
you ready?

650
00:44:43,334 --> 00:44:44,316
Fight!

651
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:13,928
Now!

652
00:45:21,292 --> 00:45:22,569
Oh, no!

653
00:45:49,072 --> 00:45:50,633

And your winner, Dillon McGwire!

655
00:46:04,307 --> 00:46:05,801
That's what I'm talking about.

656
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:12,818
Nice job!

657
00:46:21,622 --> 00:46:24,939
Hey, champ. Next
time, work a little sweat, huh ?

658
00:46:28,022 --> 00:46:29,037
Yeah !

659
00:46:42,778 --> 00:46:44,753
Hell of a horse you've got here, Jim.

660
00:46:47,162 --> 00:46:48,570
People are talking.

661
00:46:50,874 --> 00:46:52,151
Is that right ?

662
00:46:52,698 --> 00:46:54,903
Yes, they say the big boys are circling.

663
00:46:54,971 --> 00:46:57,044
Ready to bring you back to the top.

664
00:46:57,884 --> 00:46:59,827
You ready to do what it takes?

665
00:47:03,516 --> 00:47:04,661
Who?

666
00:47:05,662 --> 00:47:07,963
Dillon - Titov, in two weeks.

667
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:11,540
What if I say no?

668
00:47:18,592 --> 00:47:20,250
He rules here, Jim.

669
00:47:20,607 --> 00:47:23,063
Nobody puts a foot on line without
paying their dues.

670
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:24,886
I did it. Well ..

671
00:47:25,025 --> 00:47:27,294
You didn't, see where it got you.

672
00:47:30,178 --> 00:47:32,665
It is the way he becomes a contender, you know that.

673
00:47:32,993 --> 00:47:35,416
In two weeks, he goes down.

674
00:47:36,482 --> 00:47:39,035
But in one month, he gets his shot.

675
00:47:42,851 --> 00:47:44,761

00:47:52,773 --> 00:47:53,755
Damn!

679
00:47:54,405 --> 00:47:55,649
What's wrong with it?

680
00:47:58,181 --> 00:48:01,222
It's 20 years old,
and I've got a shitty government salary.

681
00:48:01,222 --> 00:48:03,131
- Is it turning over?
- Yeah.

682
00:48:03,366 --> 00:48:04,935
it's probably the battery.

683
00:48:04,935 --> 00:48:06,942
Can I see the Phillips wrench ?

684
00:48:11,016 --> 00:48:12,608
I already tried the connection.

685
00:48:20,073 --> 00:48:21,283
Okay, try it now.

686
00:48:22,602 --> 00:48:23,976
Try it now?

687
00:48:28,331 --> 00:48:30,120
I was a Marine, you know?

688
00:48:30,251 --> 00:48:31,627
I'm trying now.

689
00:48:31,627 --> 00:48:33,897
I wiped the sand from the intake valve ...

690
00:48:35,084 --> 00:48:38,280
The distributor cap's loose.
You're gonna have to replace it eventually.

691
00:48:39,211 --> 00:48:41,514
There was a trade
program in Angola.

692
00:48:42,348 --> 00:48:44,388
You're a fascinating character,
you know that?

693
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,436
Gotta go pick up my little girl.

694
00:48:47,886 --> 00:48:50,504
- Should I come back?
- Your work is done here, go in peace.

695
00:48:54,063 --> 00:48:55,208

Come on!

700
00:49:05,296 --> 00:49:06,507
Are you quitting ?

701
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,305
You're holding back on me?

702
00:49:08,305 --> 00:49:10,378
You're holding back on yourself ?
You coward!

703
00:49:11,153 --> 00:49:13,193
Yes ! That's it !

704
00:49:13,425 --> 00:49:15,149
this. That's what I wanna see.

705
00:49:15,922 --> 00:49:19,719
You will not always be the best
l, that we cannot escape.

717
00:49:52,633 --> 00:49:54,291
- Thanks.
- What's going on ?

718
00:49:55,672 --> 00:49:58,297
This Allison Kaufman
Crush MMA circuit.

719
00:49:58,297 --> 00:50:00,761
Miss Kaufman, this is "the" LA Jim.

720
00:50:00,761 --> 00:50:02,650
He turns pretenders
into contenders.

721
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:04,698
Jim, I'm such a huge fan of yours.

722
00:50:04,698 --> 00:50:07,130
I saw you fight Gracie
Back in Newport Beach.

723
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:09,019
- What can I do for you?
- I represent Crush.

724
00:50:09,019 --> 00:50:11,515
We've been watching Dillon for a while...
And we think ...

725
00:50:11,515 --> 00:50:12,731
he's gonna be a huge star.

726
00:50:12,731 --> 00:50:14,332
They want him to fight
"Titan" Powell.

727
00:50:14,332 --> 00:50:15,836
We think it would be
such a cool fight.

728
00:50:15,836 --> 00:50:17,020
In one month in Baton Rouge.

729
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:19,644
Dillon's first fight where he
bites his tongue has more than ...

730
00:50:19,644 --> 00:50:21,467
a million hits on YouTube.

731
00:50:22,813 --> 00:50:24,438
- No.
- What ?

732
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:30,237
Of course we provide
a 50000 dollar contract for the fight.

733
00:50:30,237 --> 00:50:33,374
He fights Titov. Then
the next step ...

734
00:50:33,374 --> 00:50:35,390
and then the next, until it is ready.

735
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:38,816
Until he's ready? The guy is
destroying guys right now.

736
00:50:38,816 --> 00:50:40,572
He is not ready.

737
00:50:41,216 --> 00:50:42,752
He fights who I say, when I say.

738
00:50:42,752 --> 00:50:43,963
Jim.

739
00:50:44,257 --> 00:50:46,712
Seventy thousand dollars?

740
00:50:47,713 --> 00:50:49,721
- I'm not gonna ask again.
- Good

741
00:50:50,209 --> 00:50:51,671
Go talk to him, please.

742
00:50:51,969 --> 00:50:54,784
Just give me a minute. I'll
sort this out and you'll be ...

743
00:50:54,882 --> 00:50:56,451
... fighting Powell in a month.

744
00:50:56,451 --> 00:50:58,360
I only have to fight one more time.

745
00:50:58,883 --> 00:51:02,681
- Yes, but D. ..
- I only owe one more fight.

746
00:51:04,099 --> 00:51:05,408
And then what?

747
00:51:05,732 --> 00:51:07,428
you're going back to stacking boxes for Lenny?

748
00:51:07,428 --> 00:51:09,316
better than getting my face beated, yes.

749
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:13,126
Look, man, Ace and Jim are the only
ones making money off your blood.

750
00:51:13,126 --> 00:51:14,278
When are we going to make us some?

751
00:51:14,278 --> 00:51:16,645
We have to turn the Philly Kid
into a global scheme ...

752
00:51:16,645 --> 00:51:18,401
The Philly Kid is dead!

753
00:51:18,469 --> 00:51:20,325
He died in prison.

754
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:22,725
And "we"?

755
00:51:23,175 --> 00:51:24,702
You mean you.

756
00:51:24,775 --> 00:51:28,423
I took those fights
to pay off your debt.

757
00:51:28,423 --> 00:51:29,704
You understand that?

758
00:51:29,704 --> 00:51:31,265
you debt.

759
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,310
I fight once more time
and that's where it ends.

760
00:51:37,257 --> 00:51:38,980
One more fight.

761
00:51:51,084 --> 00:51:54,281
- Where did you get 8000 dollars?
- You the IRS?

762
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:58,122
Put it all on my boy
to break Titov in half.

763
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,715
- Where did it come from?
- Come on, man.

764
00:52:02,093 --> 00:52:03,555
It's clean.

765
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,120
LEAVES OF GRASS

766
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,423
THEY ARE MY PAST NOT YOURS.
SORRY. - DILLON

767
00:52:44,563 --> 00:52:46,124
How's my horse feeling?

768
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:47,733
He is ready.

769
00:52:47,733 --> 00:52:50,837
Good, good. We have a lot
of roll on this run now, don't we?

770
00:52:50,837 --> 00:52:52,113
Yes.

771
00:52:52,437 --> 00:52:55,919
- oh Jakey, good luck out there, you hear?
- Yes

772
00:53:07,224 --> 00:53:08,947
You're gonna murder this guy !

773
00:53:09,208 --> 00:53:10,834
You're gonna kill him !

774
00:53:10,936 --> 00:53:13,075
Hey! One minute!

775
00:53:14,168 --> 00:53:17,846
And next up, a fans' favorite,
it's gonna be good.

776
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:22,705
Let's give a Texas Club welcome
to Dillon McGwire!

777
00:53:25,562 --> 00:53:26,642
Shoes.

778
00:53:29,243 --> 00:53:30,421
Gloves.

779
00:53:32,475 --> 00:53:35,510
With a record of 7 in 2 ...

780
00:53:36,316 --> 00:53:40,660
The Russian Monster , Andres Titov.

781
00:53:52,064 --> 00:53:57,050
USA! USA! USA!

782
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,602
Remember the training, man.

783
00:54:17,571 --> 00:54:20,059
Touch gloves. Here comes
the first bell.

784
00:54:21,156 --> 00:54:22,138
Ready?

785
00:54:23,044 --> 00:54:24,059
Ready?

786
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:26,041
- Fight!
- Go, Dillon!

787
00:55:02,443 --> 00:55:04,450
Hands up! Hands up!

788
00:55:05,962 --> 00:55:07,686
Move it, move it!

789
00:55:11,692 --> 00:55:13,666
Stay calm, D! Stay calm!

790
00:55:16,493 --> 00:55:17,605
Come on!

791
00:55:31,055 --> 00:55:32,266
Come on!

792
00:55:45,458 --> 00:55:47,153
That the end of round one.

793
00:55:47,153 --> 00:55:49,543
Let's give it to these guys,
Make some noise.

794
00:55:50,771 --> 00:55:52,691
- What is going on?
- I can't see anything.

795
00:55:52,691 --> 00:55:53,803
Wash him out.

796
00:55:54,707 --> 00:55:56,851
He's opening himself up every time
with that hook.

797
00:55:56,851 --> 00:55:58,100
Wait for it and then finish him.

798
00:55:58,100 --> 00:55:59,923
My eyes are burning,
I can't see a fucking thing.

799
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:01,101
Wash it.

800
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:04,915
Wait for the hook, you'll be fine.

801
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:09,067
What's the champions never do?

802
00:56:09,173 --> 00:56:10,667
- Quit.
- Go get him.

803
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,548
Fight!

804
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:42,262
Come on, D!

805
00:56:43,035 --> 00:56:44,187
What are you doing?

806
00:56:44,187 --> 00:56:45,499
Stopping this fight,
he's not well today.

807
00:56:45,499 --> 00:56:46,875
No, no, no. don't stop, he's fine.

808
00:56:46,875 --> 00:56:48,021
He will kill him.

809
00:56:55,581 --> 00:56:56,628
Come on, D!

810
00:57:14,944 --> 00:57:17,792
Your winner and still undefeated ...

811
00:57:18,112 --> 00:57:20,284
Dillon McGwire!

812
00:57:21,409 --> 00:57:23,930
God, I love that
sweeper move.

813
00:57:24,514 --> 00:57:26,270
I didn't see this coming.

814
00:57:31,075 --> 00:57:33,442
- How does it look Doc?
- Like he's been drugged.

815
00:57:34,018 --> 00:57:35,295
What ?

816
00:57:35,428 --> 00:57:38,330
Probably Rohypnol or some
type of tranquilizer.

817
00:57:38,723 --> 00:57:40,131
Come on, no way !...

818
00:57:40,131 --> 00:57:43,396
I've been stitching fighters for 30 years,
I know when someone's micked.

819
00:57:43,396 --> 00:57:44,989
Russian immigrants, they are ...

820
00:57:46,341 --> 00:57:48,164
they're dirty and everybody knows it.

821
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:50,501
Probably had some shit
in his gloves.

822
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:53,731
It would take a shotgun to
bring my animal down, right, D?

823
00:57:54,086 --> 00:57:56,230
Three to one!
All he does is win!

824
00:57:56,230 --> 00:57:57,767
He's got a big fight.

825
00:57:57,767 --> 00:58:00,648
I already stitched his eye, but
you're gonna have to keep him awake ...

826
00:58:00,648 --> 00:58:03,298
at least for the next eight hours
because of the risk of concussion.

827
00:58:03,559 --> 00:58:06,376
Keep him awake? I can do that.
I am a champ of it.

828
00:58:06,376 --> 00:58:07,456
How did I do?

829
00:58:11,017 --> 00:58:12,511
You did what you do.

830
00:58:14,281 --> 00:58:16,169
That's why I chose to train you.

831
00:58:21,994 --> 00:58:23,653
You did good, kid.

832
00:58:28,876 --> 00:58:30,763
Hey! You're falling asleep ?

833
00:58:31,596 --> 00:58:32,780
You're awake?

834
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:34,243
You know what we should've done ?

835
00:58:35,789 --> 00:58:37,960
We should've invited that dirty Russian.

836
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,620
Tina ! Come here !

837
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:42,441
- Hello, guys.
- Give me a hug.

838
00:58:45,134 --> 00:58:48,015
This is the champ' right here.
This is the champ'.

839
00:58:48,015 --> 00:58:50,799
Hey. We need to keep him up
four hours.

840
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:51,847
Ok

841
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,185
Keep him up, come on!

842
00:58:54,288 --> 00:58:56,971
- D, get up and dance with her!
- Come here, champ'.

843
00:58:57,232 --> 00:58:58,345
Another drink.

844
00:59:41,175 --> 00:59:43,063
Wow, man.

845
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:47,865
What do you think are you doing?

846
00:59:47,865 --> 00:59:49,839
- Gimme the keys.
- Are you even awake ?

847
00:59:49,976 --> 00:59:51,577
Stop messling around and give me the keys.

848
00:59:51,577 --> 00:59:55,025
- You can't even open your eyes.
- Yes, get in the car, drunko.

849
00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:57,678
Come here !

850
00:59:58,683 --> 01:00:01,465
You're really becoming to be
a pain in my ass !

851
01:00:06,075 --> 01:00:09,053
Two hundred thousand dollars !
That's what I'm due !

852
01:00:09,053 --> 01:00:10,394
What are you talking about?

853
01:00:10,844 --> 01:00:12,121
Shut up!

854
01:00:13,308 --> 01:00:16,124
You were supposed to lose that fight!

855
01:00:16,189 --> 01:00:18,523
But L.A. Jim, he dropped the ball.

856
01:00:18,813 --> 01:00:21,791
So I had to eliminate him.
'Cause he was unreliable.

857
01:00:21,791 --> 01:00:23,646
I can't have unreliable.

858
01:00:23,646 --> 01:00:27,128
So now, I'm here to appeal
directly to the source.

859
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:31,035
You boys owe me
two hundred thousand dollars.

860
01:00:31,392 --> 01:00:34,741
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
I've got 10 thousand.

861
01:00:36,032 --> 01:00:37,975
You think I don't know everything?

862
01:00:39,937 --> 01:00:42,686
You've got 24. Which is mine.

863
01:00:42,977 --> 01:00:45,634
Which means you still
owe me 176 000.

864
01:00:45,634 --> 01:00:47,390
I owe you shit!

865
01:00:49,475 --> 01:00:50,490
Come here.

866
01:00:52,035 --> 01:00:53,311
Open your mouth.

867
01:00:54,403 --> 01:00:55,581
Open it.

868
01:00:57,156 --> 01:00:58,203
Think.

869
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:01,275
So we're clear ...

870
01:01:01,733 --> 01:01:03,675
You're taking the Titan to fight ...

871
01:01:04,741 --> 01:01:06,661
... and you're gonna lose.

872
01:01:06,661 --> 01:01:08,386
In the second.

873
01:01:09,318 --> 01:01:10,463
Say it.

874
01:01:12,485 --> 01:01:13,798
Say it!

875
01:01:13,798 --> 01:01:16,417
Yes! Yes, I'm gonna lose!

876
01:01:20,328 --> 01:01:21,854
good to hear.

877
01:01:29,801 --> 01:01:31,711
I am owed.

878
01:01:53,005 --> 01:01:53,933
You'll be fine.

879
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,069
She'll be allright.

880
01:02:09,967 --> 01:02:13,230
I'm gonna need
some more hot water ... and towels.

881
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:16,173
Take it easy, kid.

882
01:02:18,833 --> 01:02:19,978
Come here.

883
01:02:24,083 --> 01:02:25,512
Take her with you.

884
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:54,006
I'm gonna make this right.

885
01:03:13,305 --> 01:03:14,866
You're a fucking monster.

886
01:03:15,354 --> 01:03:16,282
Let him out.

887
01:03:19,099 --> 01:03:20,211
Guards!

888
01:03:46,688 --> 01:03:48,510
If it wasn't for your brother ...

889
01:03:49,888 --> 01:03:51,098
I would be dead.

890
01:03:53,825 --> 01:03:55,865
Every week they
came at me.

891
01:03:58,433 --> 01:04:00,288
I became a monster.

892
01:04:03,074 --> 01:04:04,984
Now that's that all I have left.

893
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:09,216
It's all that I can feel.

894
01:04:14,819 --> 01:04:16,576
You're not a monster.

895
01:04:18,212 --> 01:04:21,083
I can feel the good in you.
Even if you can't.

896
01:04:24,198 --> 01:04:26,205
And if I can' do this?

897
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:30,427
We can.

898
01:04:37,068 --> 01:04:38,893
I check the county morgue,
I find his name?

899
01:04:38,893 --> 01:04:39,853
Yes.

900
01:04:39,853 --> 01:04:41,644
- What was it?
- Jim Jacoby.

901
01:04:41,644 --> 01:04:43,368
Also known as L.A. Jim .

902
01:04:43,533 --> 01:04:45,389
- And the cops ?
- Marks.

903
01:04:45,389 --> 01:04:46,633
Ray Marks?

904
01:04:47,118 --> 01:04:48,874
You know, he called me in the morning.

905
01:04:49,998 --> 01:04:51,887
He said he was investigating
a murder.

906
01:04:51,887 --> 01:04:54,026
Committed by a drug dealer
named Ace Reed.

907
01:04:55,023 --> 01:04:57,360
He asked me to keep an eye on you,
see if you seemed jumpy.

908
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,116
Maybe like you would be leaving town.

909
01:05:04,721 --> 01:05:06,449
I'm telling you the truth.

910
01:05:06,449 --> 01:05:08,817
And if he frames Ace,
it will be with this gun.

911
01:05:10,257 --> 01:05:11,346
I need your help.

912
01:05:11,346 --> 01:05:13,489
Shell casing on a cop
is not gonna be enough.

913
01:05:13,489 --> 01:05:14,603
I'll give more.

914
01:05:15,058 --> 01:05:16,716
Let's say this is all true.

915
01:05:17,746 --> 01:05:18,957
Why don't you run?

916
01:05:19,892 --> 01:05:22,128
You know how many assholes
jump their parole every month?

917
01:05:22,547 --> 01:05:25,582
Maybe you run, maybe I'm
too tired to find you.

918
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:28,402
-I can't leave.
- Why not?

919
01:05:29,812 --> 01:05:31,405
I can't leave her.

920
01:05:34,165 --> 01:05:35,594
I can't leave her.

921
01:05:38,806 --> 01:05:40,813
I'm 3 to 1 in Biloxi.

922
01:05:40,886 --> 01:05:43,276
- If you put 300 000 on me ...
- 300 grand ?

923
01:05:44,311 --> 01:05:46,133
You did your run already.

924
01:05:46,487 --> 01:05:49,303
Besides, my money's safe
away in the bank.

925
01:05:49,848 --> 01:05:51,992
Why do I need another shot
on a horse...

926
01:05:51,992 --> 01:05:54,228
-  ... that probably can't even win?
- For the same reason I do.

927
01:05:54,392 --> 01:05:55,702
To get out.

928
01:05:57,113 --> 01:05:59,252
Marks, he's gonna pin L.A. Jim on you.

929
01:06:04,954 --> 01:06:06,231
Is that right ?

930
01:06:08,635 --> 01:06:10,235
So how are we gonna skin this cat ?

931
01:06:10,235 --> 01:06:12,059
300 000 on me to win ...

932
01:06:12,059 --> 01:06:14,002
and I want two of your guys ...

933
01:06:14,556 --> 01:06:16,411
and you must stay away from the fight.

934
01:06:17,372 --> 01:06:19,129
You must win the fight.

935
01:06:26,430 --> 01:06:28,667
You'll need more than
a shell casing.

936
01:06:28,862 --> 01:06:32,791
Yes, but tell me in the I.A
doesn't have a phonebook these guys.

937
01:06:57,890 --> 01:06:59,451
Can not hide forever.

938
01:07:05,284 --> 01:07:07,301
I want these photos on
the web site tonight ...

939
01:07:07,301 --> 01:07:10,464
And get them to Allan in L.A.
for the local TV press conference.

940
01:07:43,946 --> 01:07:45,921
32, 33 ...

941
01:07:46,474 --> 01:07:50,753
34, 35, 36, 37 ...

942
01:07:52,396 --> 01:07:53,738
He is still circling...

943
01:07:54,156 --> 01:07:56,524
Right there, see how he puts
his head down when he shoots ?

944
01:07:56,524 --> 01:07:58,150
Watch this, watch this.

945
01:07:59,630 --> 01:08:01,036
Boom! Right there.

946
01:08:15,856 --> 01:08:20,080
Ladies and gentlemen, our judge
has called a stop to the action ...

947
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:24,146
in 2 minutes and 47 seconds
in the very final round ...

948
01:08:24,146 --> 01:08:25,841
declaring its winner ...

949
01:08:25,841 --> 01:08:32,912
Johnny Rattlehouse Toothless!

950
01:08:33,682 --> 01:08:36,051
So, tell us about your new golden
boy, Dillon McGwire.

951
01:08:36,051 --> 01:08:39,283
This really fight of a lifetime
for Dillon McGwire.

952
01:08:39,283 --> 01:08:43,440
He was in need of a second chance and
Crush decided to give it to him.

953
01:08:43,603 --> 01:08:44,913
One minute!

954
01:08:53,654 --> 01:08:54,701
Right.

955
01:08:55,125 --> 01:08:58,391
Remember, stay low,
try to work your way on the inside.

956
01:08:58,391 --> 01:09:00,695
He will want some big shots.
Watch him ...

957
01:09:00,695 --> 01:09:02,604
get ready to move. Right?

958
01:09:06,199 --> 01:09:09,266
Whatever happens, make
sure she gets out.

959
01:09:09,977 --> 01:09:11,384
On the count of three!

960
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:13,049
Let's make some noise!

961
01:09:13,049 --> 01:09:15,984
One, two, three!

962
01:09:18,298 --> 01:09:19,891
What the champions never do?

963
01:09:20,601 --> 01:09:21,617
Quit.

964
01:09:39,197 --> 01:09:41,598
He was a wrestling specialist...

965
01:09:41,598 --> 01:09:43,870
weighing one ninety ripple-y ...

966
01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:46,521
good muscle-y pounds ...

967
01:09:47,007 --> 01:09:48,468
Wait, friends.

968
01:09:49,406 --> 01:09:50,520
Wait for it.

969
01:09:52,735 --> 01:09:55,156
I see you at the end
of the second round.

970
01:09:55,935 --> 01:09:58,976
Ladies and gentlemen, a
round of applause ...

971
01:09:58,976 --> 01:10:02,872
Dillon McGwire!

972
01:10:07,041 --> 01:10:10,723
And here comes Dillon McGwire, the All American
that was once considered ...

973
01:10:10,723 --> 01:10:12,898
one of the best amateur
wrestlers in the world.

974
01:10:12,898 --> 01:10:15,172
This guy's a huge
underdog tonight ...

975
01:10:15,172 --> 01:10:17,251
but he doesn't seem
to recognize that.

976
01:10:17,251 --> 01:10:20,383
Look at the glare in his eyes.
This guy is totally dawdling.

977
01:10:29,061 --> 01:10:32,902
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
introducing his opponent ...

978
01:10:32,902 --> 01:10:35,488
seeking to maintain its title.

979
01:10:39,719 --> 01:10:42,108
Weighing tonight one hundred...

980
01:10:42,215 --> 01:10:45,761
and 88 pounds ...

981
01:10:46,184 --> 01:10:48,355
The Bayou Bomber ...

982
01:10:48,712 --> 01:10:52,837
Titan Powell!

983
01:11:03,563 --> 01:11:07,020
You know what, this guy scares the hell
out of me every time I see him.

984
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:09,420
You talk with him outside the ring
and he's the nicest guy possible.

985
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:12,877
But when he gets inside this cage,
he's a complete monster.

986
01:11:12,877 --> 01:11:15,053
Hey, do not worry about it,
it's all show.

987
01:11:15,053 --> 01:11:16,717
Despite the reputation of Titan ...

988
01:11:16,717 --> 01:11:19,401
I think we will see a very
evenly balanced fight tonight.

989
01:11:19,565 --> 01:11:22,445
Neither of these guys
is the kind to give an inch.

990
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:24,591
And both of the guys are coming in
undefeated tonight.

991
01:11:24,591 --> 01:11:27,340
But I just don't think Dillon
McGwire has ever dealt ...

992
01:11:27,471 --> 01:11:31,301
with the type of power that
Titan's gonna bring with his punches tonight.

993
01:11:35,119 --> 01:11:36,298
FEEL MY PAIN

994
01:11:41,873 --> 01:11:43,602
Okay, gentlemen.
three three minutes rounds.

995
01:11:43,602 --> 01:11:46,001
Keep it clean. somebody taps,
they're gone.

996
01:11:46,001 --> 01:11:47,890
Disengage, and go to your corners.

997
01:11:47,890 --> 01:11:50,034
When the bell rings,
come out ready to fight.

998
01:11:50,034 --> 01:11:51,114
Touch gloves.

999
01:11:53,139 --> 01:11:54,383
First round.

1000
01:11:56,915 --> 01:11:57,843
Chump.

1001
01:12:03,988 --> 01:12:05,297
Fighters ready!

1002
01:12:05,557 --> 01:12:06,637
Ready?

1003
01:12:06,902 --> 01:12:07,850
Fight!

1004
01:12:51,132 --> 01:12:53,949
Powell is going up for the guillotine
early here.

1005
01:12:53,949 --> 01:12:55,924
Dillon McGwire may
be in trouble.

1006
01:13:06,975 --> 01:13:09,151
Titan Powell is completely
manhandling it.

1007
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:10,297
Get off!

1008
01:13:26,018 --> 01:13:27,294
Let it go.

1009
01:13:32,195 --> 01:13:34,018
Spilt, spilt.

1010
01:13:39,717 --> 01:13:40,797
Ready?

1011
01:13:41,572 --> 01:13:42,620
Fight!

1012
01:13:58,728 --> 01:14:00,004
Get out, D!

1013
01:14:23,179 --> 01:14:24,488
Here, here, here.

1014
01:14:25,899 --> 01:14:27,493
Hey. Hey.

1015
01:14:27,948 --> 01:14:29,606
Here are two twenties.

1016
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:33,577
You can take that to that
guy over there? Thank you.

1017
01:14:37,133 --> 01:14:38,344
It's allright. he's good.

1018
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:39,502
Take.

1019
01:14:39,502 --> 01:14:42,055
Hey! Keep your hands up,
he's fast!

1020
01:14:49,967 --> 01:14:51,856
This is a beauty pageant for them.

1021
01:14:52,784 --> 01:14:55,632
Sure, if he goes to the floor again
he's gonna want to throw in a guillotine.

1022
01:14:55,632 --> 01:14:58,000
Open him up.
Make him fucking pay.

1023
01:15:00,209 --> 01:15:01,256
Get at him !

1024
01:15:14,964 --> 01:15:15,946
Ready?

1025
01:15:16,692 --> 01:15:17,707
Fight!

1026
01:15:17,875 --> 01:15:20,048
I'm gonna break you, fish.

1027
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:21,130
Come !

1028
01:15:44,312 --> 01:15:46,167
A spectacular move !

1029
01:15:48,504 --> 01:15:51,026
Powell is seeking the
guillotine again.

1030
01:15:55,803 --> 01:15:57,112
D, get out !

1031
01:15:58,683 --> 01:16:00,111
don't take this.

1032
01:16:49,731 --> 01:16:51,324
Powell is rocked!

1033
01:17:17,864 --> 01:17:22,403
A punch in the eye, maybe two,
before it closes completely.

1034
01:17:22,599 --> 01:17:24,649
If the eye closes more,
I stop this fight.

1035
01:17:24,649 --> 01:17:27,998
Why not stop earlier this round?
Look at Powell, he can barely stand...

1036
01:17:47,245 --> 01:17:48,260
Ready?

1037
01:17:49,005 --> 01:17:50,052
Fight!

1038
01:18:15,728 --> 01:18:18,066
Dillon McGwire
took Powell in a neck key.

1039
01:18:18,066 --> 01:18:19,472
This may be the end.

1040
01:18:33,941 --> 01:18:35,315
Good job, D!

1041
01:18:51,895 --> 01:18:53,302
great gig.

1042
01:18:53,559 --> 01:18:55,533
Thanks. Great fight.

1043
01:18:57,271 --> 01:19:00,720
Ladies and gentlemen, we
have just witnessed history.

1044
01:19:02,968 --> 01:19:05,838
The giant has fallen tonight ...

1045
01:19:13,594 --> 01:19:15,155
McGwire!

1046
01:19:17,147 --> 01:19:18,129
Go.

1047
01:19:32,189 --> 01:19:33,913
We have the suspect ...

1048
01:19:34,397 --> 01:19:36,569
- Hey, man.
- Hey!

1049
01:19:38,559 --> 01:19:39,454
Come on, asshole.

1050
01:19:39,454 --> 01:19:40,991
You have the right
to remain silent.

1051
01:19:40,991 --> 01:19:42,111
I know my rights.

1052
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:44,348
Anything you say or do can be
used against you and ...

1053
01:19:45,823 --> 01:19:48,064
McGwire I'll kill you! You hear me?!

1054
01:19:48,064 --> 01:19:50,241
Take all of Titan Powell's
off the website.

1055
01:19:50,241 --> 01:19:51,969
I wanna bring McGwire front
and center.

1056
01:19:51,969 --> 01:19:55,360
Get on the phone with New York, let them know
we just had the fight of the century ...

1057
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,953
broadcast to millions of homes and
that this train is leaving the station ...

1058
01:19:57,953 --> 01:19:58,968
with or without them.

1059
01:19:59,394 --> 01:20:02,657
Dillon, that was amazing.
I'm talking six figures.

1060
01:20:05,282 --> 01:20:07,170
What is going on ? Where is he ?

1061
01:20:07,458 --> 01:20:09,315
- Who?
- Seriously, Jake ...

1062
01:20:09,315 --> 01:20:12,772
I need to put an interview on the
website before Tokyo wakes up.

1063
01:20:12,772 --> 01:20:14,114
Yeah... I don't think
he's gonna make it.

1064
01:20:14,724 --> 01:20:16,196
He just fought the fight
of his life ...

1065
01:20:16,196 --> 01:20:17,538
We need to cash in.

1066
01:20:18,853 --> 01:20:20,031
We did.

1067
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:40,673
Mr. Delano.

1068
01:20:45,705 --> 01:20:47,363

But the sun's shining boos And
the air I breathe is new,

1080

01:22:48,253 --> 01:22:51,930
Home, where I go I
have a place to go

1085
01:22:52,574 --> 01:22:57,593
Home, Where I go where
the wild winds blow

1092
01:23:30,852 --> 01:23:36,261
I can see my peace of mind
Almost apsa border

1093
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:41,830
And waited all this time to
get to the heat of the Sun

1094
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:47,207
Now there's nothing to hide
we understand ourselves

1095
01:23:47,207 --> 01:23:52,838
But when the sun sets today
love, you stand beside me

1096
01:23:53,512 --> 01:23:58,248
Home, where I go I
have a place to go

1097
01:23:59,081 --> 01:24:04,035
Home, Where I go where
the wild winds blow

1098
01:24:04,426 --> 01:24:09,162
Home, where I follow
love, take me home

01:24:09,162 --> 01:24:11,072
Take me home

1100
01:24:25,613 --> 01:24:31,015
The heat is already going
j And just this dead town

1101
01:24:31,405 --> 01:24:36,590
I can hear that sweet sound
of a new world turning

1102
01:24:36,590 --> 01:24:42,192
So now my heart beats fast
Yes, overcame my past

1103
01:24:42,192 --> 01:24:47,910
No more questions to ask
Then finally'll go home

1104
01:24:48,336 --> 01:24:53,193
Home, where I go I
have a place to go

1105
01:24:53,873 --> 01:24:58,729
Home, Where I go where
the wild winds blow

1106
01:24:59,442 --> 01:25:03,923
Home, where I follow
love, take me home

1107
01:25:03,923 --> 01:25:05,777
Take me home

1108
01:25:30,743 --> 01:25:35,479
Home, where I go I
have a place to go

1109
01:25:36,312 --> 01:25:41,135
Home, Where I go where
the wild winds blow

love, take me home
