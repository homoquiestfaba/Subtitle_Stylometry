1
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,915
- Move!
- Let's go, let's go!

2
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,114
We did it, right?

3
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,831
Whoa! What the hell are you doing?

4
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,749
- G-Girl!
- It's G-Girl!

5
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,077
Gun!

6
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,278
G-Girl! G-Girl! G-Girl! G-Girl!

7
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:52,989
Wow. If you could have any superpower,
what would it be?

8
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,958
The ability to blow myself.

9
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,798
That's quite a visual.

10
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,633
- But wouldn't it seem a little...
- Gay?

11
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,111
- No, not at all. Think about it.
- Yeah, really? It seems that way.

12
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,350
Oh, dude. Check her out.

13
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,953
Ooh. Wow.

14
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,919
What do we have here?
Kind of uptight librarian on the outside,

15
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,116
ready to rumble on the inside.

16
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,919
- Go ask her out.
- No. I'm not ready yet. I can't.

17
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,956
Oh, Matt. You're killing me.

18
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,999
Your last insane girlfriend dumped you,
like, six months ago.

19
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,038
I would have ploughed my way
through half of SoHo by now.

20
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,793
That's cos you're soulless and shallow.

21
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,791
It is a blessing.

22
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,474
Go over there. Talk to her. Do it.

23
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,836
- Matt, say hi. Give me your bag. Come on.
- OK, OK.

24
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,831
Yes.

25
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,434
All out. Be strong. Breathe.

26
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,471
Eye of the tiger.

27
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,553
Hi.

28
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,634
Excuse me. I know I don't really know you,
but you look like a very interesting person,

29
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,280
so at the risk of totally humiliating myself,

30
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,158
I thought perhaps sometime
I might buy you a cup...

31
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,231
No!

32
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,272
It doesn't have to be a cup of coffee. It could
be whatever you want. A cup of anything.

33
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,590
Juice? Hey!

34
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,151
Hey!

35
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,511
Hey!

36
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,029
Hey!

37
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,475
Somebody stop that guy!

38
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,912
That's right. You better run, asshole!

39
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,199
Keep running, my man!
You don't want any of this. Keep running.

40
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,550
Yeah!

41
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,150
- What did you call me?
- Oh, shit!

42
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,231
What did you call me?

43
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,671
Idiot.

44
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,474
Come on! Get out of there.

45
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,792
Let's go! I know you're in there.
Get out of there!

46
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,431
Whoa!

47
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,711
Hey. How about it, huh?

48
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,674
So how about that cup of coffee?
Or it could be something more substantial.

49
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,877
- Like dinner?
- Yeah. That'd be great.

50
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,871
- Matt Saunders.
- Jenny Johnson.

51
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,272
Jenny Johnson. Wonderful name.
You got the whole alliteration thing going.

52
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,874
I grew up with a guy named
Francis Freddie Friedman.

53
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,636
A bit of a klepto, not the kind of guy you'd
want over if you had spare cash laying out.

54
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,358
Yeah, right. Right.

55
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,159
So, um... May I get your number?

56
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,870
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't give it out.
Privacy issues. I'll take yours, though.

57
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,394
- OK. Actually, I don't think I have a pen.
- I do.

58
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,870
Thanks. Isn't this something women do
just to blow off losers?

59
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,110
Yes, women do do that.

60
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,192
But that's not how I blow off losers.

61
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,390
Hey, Saunders, heads up.

62
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,239
- Oh, you have bad reflexes.
- You know, you're a danger in the workplace.

63
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,596
Do you have the bathroom layouts
for the Beijing presentation?

64
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,231
- I'll take a look at those.
- I finished them up last night.

65
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,149
- Hey, Hannah.
- Hey, Vaughn.

66
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,952
- Looks good.
- Thank you.

67
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,156
What about... Is this OK?

68
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,516
It's a bit tight,
but I talked to the structural engineer...

69
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,990
- How's your boyfriend? Isn't his name Rick?
- Steve. He's good.

70
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,594
He just got back from Milan. Look at this.

71
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,798
- Milan?
- Yes, his new Joe Boxer ad campaign.

72
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,429
Wow. He's buff. Are you into that?

73
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,638
I would think this is more your style.
What do you think?

74
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,794
Two months in a gym, a personal trainer and
the right steroids, I look like that or better.

75
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,910
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

76
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,630
- What are you doing?!
- Huh?

77
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,316
Hey, Carla. Nothing. Just reshelving
some reference material, trying to stay ahead.

78
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,676
- You were staring at her butt.
- He was?

79
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,672
- No. No, I was not.
- Yes, he was.

80
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,673
Hannah, as you know, we have
a zero-tolerance policy for this behavior.

81
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,877
I actually read that memo twice. I got it.

82
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,030
You should be familiar with this part.

83
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,634
Would you like to file a grievance
at this time?

84
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,599
Um... I don't think so, Carla.

85
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,276
Because, as your supervisor, I am officially
giving you that opportunity right now.

86
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,354
And I thank you for that,
but I think I'm just gonna let this one slide.

87
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,954
That's completely your decision.

88
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,511
- Will you sign a statement to that effect?
- Sure. Yes.

89
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,318
You are lucky this time, Mr. Bottom Watcher.

90
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,234
- Hello?
- Matt? Hey. It's Jenny Johnson.

91
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,632
- Hey, Jenny. I wasn't sure I'd hear from you.
- So are we still on for dinner?

92
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,713
- Dinner? Absolutely. That sounds great.
- Is that a girl? A real, live girl?

93
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,713
A great new Indian place on Madison
just opened up. Eight o'clock?

94
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,678
Indian? Love it. I'll see you tomorrow night.

95
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,716
OK. Great. See you. Bye.

96
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,108
Saunders! Do you have a date?

97
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,998
Got a date. And it's a hot one.

98
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,390
So the assistant curator job's
really perfect for me.

99
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,872
I was an art history major in college.
It's the only thing I'm good at.

100
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,511
At least, the only thing I'm good at
I can make any money off.

101
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,718
- That sounded like I was talking about sex.
- No. No, it didn't.

102
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,995
Believe me, I didn't mean sex.

103
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,152
- I mean, I am good at sex.
- I'm sure you are.

104
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,470
- Now it sounds like I'm bragging.
- No, no.

105
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,634
I think I'm good at sex.
I don't know, you decide.

106
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,152
Me?

107
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,959
But not tonight. It's our first date.

108
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,871
Yeah.

109
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,195
So what do you do?

110
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,716
I'm a project manager at a design firm.

111
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,476
We design and build private estates,
libraries, hotels, that sort of thing.

112
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,236
Yeah, right now, we're...

113
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,315
- I'm sorry. Am I bothering you?
- What?

114
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,868
No. No. Um...

115
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,070
I was just trying to listen to something.

116
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,595
I don't hear anything.

117
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,399
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
I have to go to the bathroom.

118
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,471
Sure.

119
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,355
- Yo, how's it going?
- Well, she's a talker, yeah.

120
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,638
- Only question is, will you sleep with her?
- <i>That's the only question, huh?</i>

121
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,111
Yes. I'm not just talking about your date
tonight. I am talking about life in general.

122
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,671
- That is the only question.
- What's going on there?

123
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,151
Uh, some big fire at 73rd and Broadway.
Everything's burning.

124
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,435
- <i>Is anyone hurt?</i>
- I don't know. Probably.

125
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,556
It's blocking my way to the gym.

126
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,313
My thoughts are with you
in this time of crisis.

127
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,354
Wow! Oh, man!

128
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,517
- <i>What's going on?</i>
- It's G-Girl! She's doing her thing.

129
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,989
Are you serious? You lucky SOB.
I've never even seen her in person.

130
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,071
How does she look?

131
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,151
She looks...

132
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,874
- <i>What?</i>
- Blurry. But still pretty hot.

133
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,872
<i>Yeah? What's she doing now?</i>

134
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:54,159
She's spinning around
like one of those things that spins.

135
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,993
<i>Amazing. That's unbelievable.</i>

136
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,071
Yeah. It's so cool.

137
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,350
Oh!

138
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:12,672
Yes. That's it, show's over.
She put the fire out. Fantastic.

139
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,709
G-Girl! G-Girl!
G-Girl! G-Girl! G-Girl!

140
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,870
Oh! OK.

141
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,669
And she's gone.
Flew off into the sunset. Amazing.

142
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,435
<i>Unbelievable. Hey, why do you think</i>
<i>they call her G-Girl?</i>

143
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,640
I don't know, like, "gorgeous" or "G-force"?
I'm not really sure.

144
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,950
<i>What do you think about "good kisser"?</i>

145
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,759
I can't believe I missed that.
I'm eating Indian food.

146
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,593
<i>Oh, wait, no, no. "Goddess woman".</i>

147
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,558
- <i>What about "G-spot"?</i>
- I gotta go. Bye.

148
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,511
Whoo!

149
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,355
Huge line. Sorry.
It was a really, really long line.

150
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,797
- You got a little something on your chin.
- What? Oh. Oh.

151
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,998
- I hate when that happens.
- When what happens?

152
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,071
Mystery smudges.

153
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,756
- Gotta go to the bathroom.
- Um... You didn't just go to the bathroom?

154
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,559
Are you keeping track? That's kind of creepy.

155
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,668
- She sounds like a nutcase.
- So you're saying she's perfect for me?

156
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,955
Crazy women are attracted to you.

157
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,032
It's like you give off a scent.

158
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,111
You should do a background check on her.

159
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,715
What do you think? Shall we
keep these walls brick or make it stucco?

160
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,872
- Did you kick the plug?
- I don't know.

161
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,874
- Let me handle this one.
- All right.

162
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,758
- Don't do that.
- Don't do what? What are you talking about?

163
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,353
You mean this?

164
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,714
Hey!

165
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,510
Sexual harassment's a two-way street. Don't
think cos I'm a guy you can manhandle me.

166
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,273
Hey! What the hell's going on here?

167
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,669
- Oh, no. Sorry, her...
- Steve.

168
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,433
Her computer had gone down.
I was plugging it back in.

169
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,513
- I'm screwing with you. I'm not worried.
- Oh. None taken.

170
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,558
- I missed you.
- I missed you too.

171
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,915
- Not here!
- Sorry.

172
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:09,238
See, Saunders? You need to be with someone
who appreciates you, like Steve here.

173
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,677
Yeah. I'm looking for Mr. Right.
Haven't found him yet, though. Not given up.

174
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:20,029
- Steve Ballard. Nice to meet you.
- This is Matt. You've met him, like, five times.

175
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,557
- Oh, right, right. Sorry.
- It's OK. I'm a very forgettable person.

176
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,474
When I was growing up, I'd come down
to breakfast and Mom would scream,

177
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,596
call the cops on me.

178
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,513
- It's a joke, right? Yeah.
- Yeah.

179
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,912
- It's a good one. Got me back.
- Hey, baby, we should be going to lunch.

180
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,949
Hey, Saunders, that woman is trouble.
Do not call her.

181
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,359
- OK, we're done.
- What happened? We just started.

182
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,874
That's it. No. I got a twinge.

183
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,269
Dude, you should definitely call her back.

184
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,432
- Yeah? You think I should?
- Oh, yeah.

185
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,710
Cos she's good to go.

186
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,031
And you haven't gone in six months.

187
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,639
Oh, yes. Plus, what's the downside?

188
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:18,353
I don't know. She seems a little, uh...
She's neurotic, you know. And distant.

189
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,672
That's good. That's a good thing.
Neurotic and distant is a very good thing.

190
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,070
Yeah, neurotic women are hellcats in bed.

191
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,031
Plus, if she's distant,
you're both in it for the same thing.

192
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,315
Coitus maximus.

193
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:39,638
There's no, "Could she be the one? I'm falling
hard for her" kind of crap to get in the way.

194
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,314
It's just pure carnal nirvana.

195
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,439
- Your argument's repugnant and intriguing.
- That's kind of my thing.

196
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,711
- Oh, hey.
- Hi. Oh, wow. Thank you.

197
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,518
- You're welcome.
- A rose.

198
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,194
Different color roses mean different things.

199
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,273
Red ones mean passion or love,
so this is great.

200
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,477
But I'm not saying I think
you're telling me that you love me.

201
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,755
I mean, it's absurdly early for that.

202
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,559
But you never know. Maybe someday.

203
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,359
Or never. No pressure.

204
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,949
Let me get us a cab. Taxi.

205
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,951
Taxi!

206
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,551
Hey, it's stopping.

207
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,028
Here we go.

208
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,190
You OK?

209
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,919
At least we got a ride.

210
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,514
Can we stop by the gallery?
We opened a new show.

211
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,149
Sounds great.
Hey, thanks for stopping. Appreciate it.

212
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,991
Wow.

213
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,388
Wonder what she's looking at.

214
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,749
Ouch! That's gotta hurt.

215
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,911
So what do you think?

216
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,913
It's interesting. And a little disturbing.

217
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,717
I know. It's surprising
how frightening things attract us.

218
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:36,796
Matt, I have to help people every day,
and nobody's ever helped me except you.

219
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,151
You're my hero.

220
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,316
I'm sorry. What is it? Tell me.

221
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,075
It's your tongue. You're using it all wrong.

222
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,593
- What are you talking about?
- You shouldn't stick it out like a dead fish.

223
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,478
You're supposed to flick it a little.

224
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,757
I think that I was flicking it, wasn't I?
I was doing that.

225
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,354
- No. Not enough.
- Really?

226
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,716
I'm not used to having my tongue skills
critiqued like this, OK?

227
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,995
Maybe not to your face.

228
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,711
Oh, man.

229
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,631
Let me help you.

230
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,674
Close your eyes.

231
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,231
Now do what I do.

232
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,675
So, uh... this is my place.
I redesigned the space when I bought it.

233
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,478
- It's nice.
- Thank you.

234
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,313
This is the dining room.
Doesn't get a lot of use.

235
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,960
- Well, I could help with that.
- OK.

236
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,271
This is my fish. That's Biggie Smalls.

237
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,430
Hi, Biggie.

238
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,910
He's... he's never met a woman before.

239
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,553
Well, he's about to get an eyeful.

240
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,717
- <i>Will you show me the rest of your place?</i>
- <i>OK.</i>

241
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,360
<i>I'll take you over to the kitchen.</i>

242
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:32,197
<i>That's the refrigerator.</i>
<i>I can get you a juice, a beer.</i>

243
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,794
<i>I'll make you anything. Yeah.</i>

244
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,431
I'm not thirsty either.

245
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,076
- And this is the, uh...
- Bed.

246
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,475
Oh, that's a great sweater. Wow.

247
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,838
What a blouse.
Let me help with those buttons.

248
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,990
- I'm sorry. I need the, um...
- Oh, yeah. The bathroom? It's right there.

249
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,515
She goes to the bathroom a lot.

250
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,389
I'm ready.

251
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,234
That's what I call structural integrity.

252
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,552
All right! You should have
been dressed like that all night.

253
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,790
You look great.

254
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,508
Let me help you with this.

255
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,591
Ooh.

256
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,552
- I must be a little nervous.
- It's OK.

257
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,632
I got a closet full of 'em.
Let me handle this one, though.

258
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,995
- Let's take care of these.
- OK.

259
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,711
Thanks.

260
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,999
Who'd have thought we'd have ended up
like this after that day on the subway?

261
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,435
Ain't life grand?

262
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,831
- Matt?
- Yeah?

263
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,029
Do you mind if I get on top?

264
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,873
Trust me, it's better that way.

265
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,951
10-4.

266
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,078
Are you ready?

267
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,913
- OK.
- OK.

268
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,195
Here we go.

269
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,391
Wow.

270
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,349
OK, I get it.

271
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,270
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

272
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,271
Whoo! Whoo!

273
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,191
Oh, goddamn!

274
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,470
OK, now I need a break.

275
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,431
Agh!

276
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,232
I'm sorry. I'll get you a new one.

277
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,029
- A bed or a penis?
- Both.

278
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,994
There are three moments
I will remember until the day I die.

279
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,234
One, the look on my father's face
when I graduated from Harvard Law School.

280
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:10,314
Two, helping a beached
mother whale give birth.

281
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,960
And three,

282
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,078
you and me together, here, tonight.

283
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,798
Don't speak to me again, ever.

284
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,391
Uh-oh. Oh, no.

285
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,516
Water, please. Got a big night.

286
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,238
No, no, no.

287
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,791
Don't tell me. You have invaded the
female nation and spread your democracy.

288
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,236
What can I say? She's completely
different than I thought she was.

289
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,312
- Hot, though, right?
- Unbelievably hot.

290
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,393
I don't even know if I should tell you this.
I don't know if you can handle it.

291
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,199
I can handle it. Please?

292
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,750
- She broke my bed.
- Wow.

293
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,035
Busted it to pieces.

294
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,157
- And that's a good thing, right?
- Yeah. That's a good thing.

295
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,516
- I'm gonna see her again today.
- What are you talking about?

296
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,114
No! You have sex with her once
and then you move on.

297
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,671
Not if you get on the greatest ever roller
coaster, you don't. You get back in that line.

298
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,753
Get in line, ride two or three more times,
throw your hands in the air and scream.

299
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,910
But soon you're gonna end up nauseous.

300
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,911
Hey, guys.

301
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,039
- How are you guys doing?
- Keep that safety bar clamped down.

302
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,238
OK, I think you are gonna like this.
I have a little present for you, Saunders.

303
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,869
- Anything for me there?
- No. No, Vaughn.

304
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,791
- You have nice ears.
- Thank you.

305
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,553
- No lobes, though.
- An imperfection. We all got 'em.

306
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:38,476
Not me. Hey, so I downloaded some
Chinese phrases for you, for the presentation.

307
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,472
- What do you think? Thought it might help.
- That's great.

308
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,472
- I thought it would help.
- You're the best, you know that?

309
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,993
I know. I am.

310
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,753
Well, I gotta get going.
I'm going to see Jenny.

311
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,638
- You're seeing Jenny? Again?
- Yeah. Yeah.

312
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,679
- Oh. Things must really be going well.
- She broke his bed.

313
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,399
Thanks. That was really thoughtful of you.

314
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,199
- Oh, no problem.
- I'll see you two later.

315
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,236
- See you, Matt.
- Look after her, OK?

316
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,151
I will.

317
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,597
- Man, he's seeing Jenny again?
- Just a few more times.

318
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:22,877
- Matt Saunders? We're gonna take a ride.
- Wait a second! Hey! Wait!

319
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:31,436
Hey, now, look.
I don't appreciate being manhandled...

320
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,715
What's going on?

321
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,555
- Mr. Saunders, thank you for your time.
- OK. Now, who are you?

322
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,792
Who am I? Do you watch television,
Mr. Saunders? Read the papers?

323
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,077
- Use the net for anything other than porn?
- You're that Bedlam guy.

324
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,993
- Professor Bedlam.
- The "supervillain".

325
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,073
Please, I am not super, I am not a villain.
I'm just a regular man, like yourself,

326
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:58,438
with 10,000 times more money,
intelligence and taste.

327
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,232
OK, so what do you want from me?

328
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,118
Are you seeing anyone, Mr. Saunders?

329
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,912
Are you asking me out? Ow!

330
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,233
I want you to tell me everything you know
about your new girlfriend.

331
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,517
- Jenny?
- Yes. Jenny.

332
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,273
Where does she like to go?
What does she like to do?

333
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,238
What music does she listen to?
Is she afraid of bugs?

334
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,550
Is she a dog person or a cat person?

335
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,076
- Does she wear panties...
- OK, now, look. Hold on just a goddamn...

336
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,517
Now, look.
It's gotta stop with the slapping, all right?!

337
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:40,438
I just don't feel real comfortable telling you,
a total stranger, someone's private habits.

338
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,114
You gotta understand that, right?

339
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,952
Of course.

340
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,558
Please, someone! Help! Help!

341
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,119
Save me! Please!

342
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,271
Weasel!

343
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,637
Hey! Help! Yeah, you! You!

344
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,915
Get somebody from the Park Service!

345
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,877
Oh, jeez!

346
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,838
No! Help me! Oh, no!

347
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,116
Oh, my God!

348
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,270
- G-Girl! G-Girl, you saved me. Thank you!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

349
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,828
- Whoa! Hold me! Hold me!
- Don't look at me!

350
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,036
- But I just wanted to...
- Don't look at me!

351
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,714
OK, yeah. No looking. Got you. Roger.

352
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,036
Wow.

353
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:06,472
Looks like little Jenny's
been cashing in on her superpowers.

354
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:10,348
Idiot! We don't want her to know
we dropped by.

355
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,631
Ah.

356
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,277
Perfect.

357
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,312
So I'm falling,
I mean, hurdling through the sky.

358
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,392
And just as I'm about to bite it,
and I mean out of nowhere,

359
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,836
she just catches me
and sets me right on the ground.

360
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,639
It was unbelievable.
The weird thing is, though,

361
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,314
that Bedlam guy,
he kept asking me about you.

362
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,960
- Do you know him?
- No, how could I know him?

363
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,793
- That's what I was thinking.
- So what was she like?

364
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,108
G-Girl?

365
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,629
I didn't really get a good look at her,
but to tell you the truth,

366
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,871
- she wasn't really what I expected, you know.
- In what way?

367
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,997
- I don't know. She just seemed a little...
- Brainy?

368
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,038
- Not really.
- Exotic? Effervescent?

369
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,554
No, I kind of got this vibe
she was a little nuts.

370
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,269
Nuts?! Maybe she was a little bit preoccupied,

371
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,715
having searched the entire city to save you

372
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,839
from being squished like a bug
on a windshield!

373
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,037
You girls all really stick together, don't you?

374
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,509
I like it. You're like one big gang.

375
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,794
- Rule number one about crossing the street?
- Look both ways.

376
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,633
That's right.

377
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,756
Jenny!

378
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,350
- One of you call 911!
- I'm fine. I'm fine. That was close.

379
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,078
I'm fine, I'm fine.

380
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:53,119
- You're not fine. How can you be fine?
- Look, Matt, I can walk.

381
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,715
Don't move. You probably have
internal bleeding and don't know it.

382
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,995
- No, not even a scratch.
- You are in shock.

383
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,358
Did anyone see this? It's like a miracle.
Truly, it's like a miracle.

384
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:10,156
I mean, are you sure that you're OK?
I mean, you seem to be walking fine.

385
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,117
Yeah.

386
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,276
This is the first time
that I've ever brought anybody here.

387
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,396
- Ever.
- Really? Wow.

388
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,554
Yeah, it seems like a really great place.

389
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,269
I'm still just kind of wondering
what the hell happened out there.

390
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,191
I know.

391
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,990
I didn't expect to do this.
At least, not yet anyway.

392
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,073
- But it's good. It's good.
- OK.

393
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:41,073
Cos what we have is so very, very special.

394
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,191
- I trust you.
- OK.

395
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,113
There should be nothing hanging between us.

396
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,112
Especially not this, don't you think?

397
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,117
I don't know what you're talking about.

398
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,237
I'll have to show you.

399
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,628
You look nice without your glasses.
You look good with them too.

400
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,990
I'll hold them for you.

401
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,316
OK...

402
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,393
I don't know what the explanation is,
but I like it already.

403
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,316
Unless it's one of those <i>Crying Game</i> things?
It's not that, is it? I mean, I'm from Denver.

404
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,755
Just wait.

405
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,992
You got a G-Girl costume on.
That's...

406
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,753
Kind of went all out, didn't you?

407
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,190
And you even dyed your...

408
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,995
Oh.

409
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,071
Wow!

410
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,071
Are you kidding me?

411
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,758
Oh, man. This is incredible.

412
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,832
- But you can't tell anyone!
- Yeah, nobody except Vaughn.

413
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,390
He slept with a Victoria's Secret model,
I've never heard the end of it.

414
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,040
- This will blow that out of the water.
- No! Nobody.

415
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,237
Matt, you have to promise me
you'll never, ever tell anyone.

416
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:22,155
- Fine, you got it.
- No matter what, you will <i>never</i> tell anyone.

417
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,276
Hey, I swear.

418
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,399
Say you'd rather have a chain saw
shoved up your ass than tell.

419
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,710
- Is that actually a possibility?
- Say it!

420
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,713
I'd rather have a chain saw
shoved up my ass than tell.

421
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,358
OK.

422
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,716
So this Bedlam guy, he's like
your arch nemesis or something?

423
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,396
Uh-huh. He's been a pain in the butt ever
since we had this falling out in high school.

424
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,710
- You guys went to school together?
- Mm-hm.

425
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,199
Wow.

426
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,113
By the way, his name's not really Bedlam.

427
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,796
It's Barry. Barry Edward Lambert.
Bedlam, get it?

428
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,759
<i>Back then, we were both kind of outcasts.</i>
<i>Everybody else hated us.</i>

429
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,718
Nerd alert! Here come the geeks.

430
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,395
<i>So we looked out for each other.</i>

431
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,951
<i>It's only natural</i>
<i>that we spent a lot of time together.</i>

432
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,030
<i>We really liked each other.</i>

433
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,630
<i>It was close to the end of our junior year</i>

434
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,395
<i>when I decided it was about time</i>
<i>to get the virginity thing over with.</i>

435
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,119
<i>I mean, Barry was harmless enough.</i>

436
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,117
<i>I figured it might as well be him, right?</i>

437
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,237
<i>He was having some trouble</i>
<i>getting his pants off.</i>

438
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,709
<i>And that's when it happened.</i>

439
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,433
Jenny!

440
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:54,149
Come on!

441
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,553
This is not how I planned this evening.

442
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,870
Oh, my God. Look at that.

443
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,628
It's so cool.

444
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:14,032
- What are you doing?
- Isn't it amazing?

445
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,156
Don't. It could be dangerous.

446
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,319
<i>When I got back to school,</i>
<i>even with a wig,</i>

447
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,392
<i>people noticed</i>
<i>there was something different about me.</i>

448
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,914
Hi, girls. Ooh, my glasses.

449
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,389
<i>And it worked for me.</i>

450
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,556
Hey.

451
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,119
Ugh!

452
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,353
<i>Unfortunately, Barry and I grew apart.</i>

453
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,635
<i>He stopped talking to me.</i>

454
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,109
<i>And then ignored me totally.</i>

455
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,396
Anyway, things got worse between us
after I graduated.

456
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,675
I committed to being a full-time superhero

457
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,673
and he fell into the evil mastermind business,
yada-yada-yada. That's my story.

458
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,079
Wow.

459
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,675
And this whole time,
I just had this weird feeling

460
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:09,276
that there was just something
a little off about you.

461
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:13,876
- Really?
- You just had a secret, that's all.

462
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,794
- A supersecret.
- Now we both do.

463
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,077
- May I ask you something?
- What?

464
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,959
I just think it could
maybe be a fun thing to try.

465
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,554
It's kind of a request.

466
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,191
Sure.

467
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,594
- Be right back.
- OK.

468
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,989
Is this what you had in mind?

469
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,277
Oh, yeah. That's it.

470
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,916
Matt Saunders,
you've been a very, very evil boy.

471
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,239
I think you need to be brought to justice.

472
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,871
Yeah. I have been known
to bend a rule here and there.

473
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,954
Total unrelenting justice.

474
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,313
Hey! Wow! Shit!

475
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,759
- Don't let go, all right?
- Oh, no.

476
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,593
Oh, yeah, you got me.

477
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,671
Scared you.

478
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,079
Wow.

479
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,594
Wow, we are high.

480
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,592
- We are really, really high.
- Oh, yeah!

481
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,879
Jenny, you know, as fun as this is,
I'm feeling just a little bit emasculated here,

482
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,999
with you kind of carrying me around
like a toy poodle. But don't let go.

483
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:03,119
Careful. Where are you going?
Careful. Come on. Fly right.

484
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,191
Be careful.

485
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,874
- I've always wanted to try this.
- Try what?

486
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:16,557
That? Wow.
I'm not sure that's gonna work up here.

487
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,631
It's draughty too.

488
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,828
What if I do this?

489
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,551
- You're not wearing any underwear.
- Yeah. I thought it might be easier that way.

490
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,796
- Isn't this fun?
- It is fun. Yeah.

491
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,190
Puts a whole new twist on the mile-high club.

492
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,236
Ready?

493
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,515
Whoa. Not ready!

494
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,835
- No!
- Just go with it.

495
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,639
- Yeah, but...
- I know, I know! Don't stop! Yes.

496
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,789
- No!
- Yes!

497
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,871
- Oh, god, no!
- Yeah!

498
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,071
Jenny!

499
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,833
Yes!

500
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,153
Yes!

501
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,994
Don't ever do that again!

502
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,070
G-Girl's hair before.

503
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,874
Watch and learn.

504
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:38,039
Her body is made
of the toughest substance known to man.

505
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,671
But I know your secret.

506
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,477
All right, now. G-Girl's hair after.

507
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,516
Yes! Yes!

508
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,832
- Saunders, what's wrong?
- I got a splinter in my finger.

509
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,276
- Let me see.
- It's no big deal. I can get it out, I just need...

510
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,999
- Come here. I'm good at this.
- What are you gonna do?

511
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,071
Hold on.

512
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,635
Hey, how did you do that?

513
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,711
Well, I have my ways.

514
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,035
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

515
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,757
Jenny, what...

516
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,990
What are you doing in New Jersey?

517
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,833
I called your office
and found out where you were.

518
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,514
I thought I would surprise you.

519
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,918
- Are you surprised?
- I am surprised. I wanted to...

520
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,117
Thanks. Good to see you.
Let me introduce you to Hannah Lewis.

521
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,749
- This is Jenny Johnson.
- Hi. It's really nice to finally meet you.

522
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,308
- Saunders talks about you all the time.
- I do.

523
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,755
- I feel like I already know you.
- Really?

524
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,673
Cos I feel like I'm just getting to know you.

525
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,957
OK. Hey, um... Got an idea.

526
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,953
Hannah and her boyfriend Steve, I was
thinking, maybe we go out this weekend,

527
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,272
just the two couples, two happy couples,
hit the town? What do you say?

528
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,998
- Great.
- Great.

529
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,149
Great.

530
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,711
Oh, OK.

531
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,911
Bye.

532
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:54,432
I'm sorry, guys. I have some bad news.

533
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:59,196
- You got a little something right there.
- Oh, thank you.

534
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,556
Steve can't make it.
He had an emergency thong shoot.

535
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,757
- A thong shoot emergency?
- Yeah, well, you know,

536
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,796
one bad wedgie can be fatal.

537
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,199
Yeah.

538
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,913
Where's our stupid waiter? Sir!

539
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,831
Hold on. Something's going on.

540
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,514
<i>The Pentagon has confirmed</i>
<i>an errant test missile</i>

541
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,672
<i>is in fact on a direct course</i>
<i>for the tristate area.</i>

542
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,958
<i>So far, all attempts to detonate or intercept</i>
<i>the missile have been unsuccessful.</i>

543
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,758
Great. Perfect.

544
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:35,153
<i>If it strikes within the city,</i>
<i>the death toll could reach into the thousands.</i>

545
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,913
- That does not sound good.
- Yeah, it sounds serious.

546
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,117
Maybe somebody should do something.

547
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,239
Mm-hm, yeah, like the air force.
It's their job, right?

548
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:49,279
So, Hannah, how long
have you and Matty known each other?

549
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:53,911
Well, we started working together at Cockrum
about three years ago.

550
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,754
<i>We're getting reports of sporadic</i>
<i>looting from the Bronx to Staten Island.</i>

551
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:01,799
<i>The government has urged people</i>
<i>not to panic and to stay in their homes.</i>

552
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,760
Mmm, gnocchi. Gnocchi sounds good.
Anyone want to share a gnocchi?

553
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,798
I'm sorry, but what if
the air force can't stop it?

554
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,952
Somebody else might need to step in.

555
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,952
Maybe somebody deserves one night out

556
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,679
without having to deal
with some impending disaster.

557
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,830
I think someone has earned it. Don't you?

558
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,475
Are you on a diet?
What are you gonna order?

559
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:35,872
I don't know. I mean, shouldn't
we be leaving? Is this safe here?

560
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,396
Sir! Can we get some service here?
I mean, I'm filling up on baguette.

561
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,552
I think everybody's preoccupied
with what's happening.

562
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,518
Maybe if someone
could just take care of the problem,

563
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:49,195
everyone can have a better night,
a smoother night, know what I mean?

564
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:52,431
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Yeah, I'd appreciate it.

565
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:55,557
In fact, I'd superappreciate it.

566
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,711
All right. Fine!

567
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,231
Is she OK? Where is she going?

568
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,630
She's fine. She gets stressed.
I have her looping around the block.

569
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:22,919
<i>Too late for a mass evacuation, the situation</i>
<i>is dangerous and potentially catastrophic.</i>

570
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,109
<i>But all the citizens of New York can do</i>
<i>is sit, wait and pray for a miracle.</i>

571
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:35,275
<i>We're now getting a live picture of the missile</i>
<i>as it approaches the city.</i>

572
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,836
<i>It appears certain that... Wait, what is that?</i>

573
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,039
<i>It is G-Girl!</i>

574
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:49,596
- <i>She is approaching the errant missile.</i>
- Love that girl!

575
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,279
<i>My God!</i>

576
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,749
<i>She just kicked it.</i>

577
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:59,038
<i>She just deflected the missile</i>
<i>away from the city.</i>

578
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,315
<i>We're safe! We are safe!</i>

579
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,598
G-Girl! G-Girl! G-Girl!

580
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:36,750
You know, Matt, there are some things
I don't need infravision to see through.

581
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,719
Sorry, what are you talking about?

582
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,190
You and that slut from your office - Hannah.

583
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:48,558
She is not a slut.
That is a terrible thing to say, Jenny.

584
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,076
- You want to screw her, don't you?
- No. No, I do not.

585
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,912
I don't believe you.

586
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,991
Can I say something?

587
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:02,038
Her boyfriend's a male model, OK? A model.

588
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,918
I don't think she'd be very interested
in a guy like me.

589
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,718
I see your point.

590
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:11,237
So you want to screw her, you just can't,
because she's got a boyfriend.

591
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:15,632
No, I'm just saying that we're friends
who work together. We're work friends.

592
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,473
Don't lie to me!

593
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,596
- What the hell did you do that for?
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

594
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:29,638
I'll pay for that, I swear.

595
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,870
OK, don't... d-don't do that.

596
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,793
Don't cry, OK? It'll be OK.

597
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,230
I know I get a little crazy sometimes.

598
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,311
It's just...

599
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,429
I love you so much.

600
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,435
OK... OK...

601
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,956
- Hey.
- Hey. How's it going?

602
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,831
Oh, sorry.

603
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,754
Look at her. She's like a cheerleader
from Spank Me University.

604
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,514
Dude, what's wrong?
You look like shit.

605
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,434
Let's go with the lighter weight today,
shall we?

606
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:34,071
I'm actually thinking that
my first impression of Jenny was accurate.

607
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,676
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, complete emotional basket case.

608
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,114
- Needy, jealous...
- Mm-hm. Jealous.

609
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:45,272
...control...
- Controlling. A trifecta. Perfect.

610
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,158
The truth is, I don't even love her.

611
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,034
I'm in love with somebody else.

612
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,270
You're in love with somebody else? Who?

613
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,669
Is it me? Oh, my God, it's me, isn't it?

614
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,433
I feel the same way. I totally...

615
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,153
That's not a good sign, is it?

616
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,835
- Who are you talking about?
- I don't wanna say. Not until I've told her.

617
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,480
But, I mean, first I have
to break it off with Jenny.

618
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:15,030
- God knows how I'm gonna do that.
- OK, come with me. Listen.

619
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:19,079
There are only two ways to successfully
break it off with a woman.

620
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,720
You can either be a jerk or a weenie.

621
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:27,193
Now, the jerk route is simple. You're like,
"Hey, babe, listen up. I'm dumping your ass."

622
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,113
Just like that. It's quick, it's easy, it's painless.

623
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:34,113
- I don't think you have the balls for it.
- Well, what's the weenie route?

624
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,192
OK, good. Weenie route. Let's go with that.

625
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,590
Sit real close, keep it romantic, OK?

626
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:46,152
Keep a kind of a sparkle in the eye,
take her hand. Give me your hand.

627
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,629
You say, "Sweetheart,

628
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:54,078
I think we need to take a little time off
from the relationship to re-evaluate things."

629
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,628
Don't return any of her calls
for a year and a half.

630
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,792
Pretty soon she'll give up
and you'll be in the clear.

631
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,030
I can't believe I actually listen to you.

632
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:05,396
Another thing. Make sure you do it
after you've had sex with her.

633
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,119
It's really difficult the other way around.

634
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:23,591
I was thinking, maybe we should
take a little time to...

635
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,274
re-examine where this is going.

636
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,591
My God.

637
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,274
Are you breaking up with me?

638
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:40,278
No. No. Not at all.

639
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:48,877
I mean, I just... I think it would be wise
to try and evaluate where we stand,

640
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,719
just to make sure we're on the same page.

641
00:49:54,600 --> 00:50:00,038
So you're not saying that we should
start seeing other people or anything?

642
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,509
No. No.

643
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,068
No, I'm not saying that.

644
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:08,675
OK, good. You scared me there for a second.

645
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:15,632
Although seeing other people might
eventually be a part of the evaluation process.

646
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,591
Oh, my God.

647
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,672
You are breaking up with me.

648
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,594
- Jenny, it's not you, OK?
- Shut up!

649
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:39,554
I know exactly what it is.
It's that slut from your office, Hannah.

650
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:42,029
- You're sleeping with her.
- I am not sleep...

651
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:45,749
- But you want to!
- Jenny, now, hold on a second, OK?

652
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,400
You're such a liar!

653
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,793
Look, I am not a liar, all right? You wanna
know the truth? It's not Hannah, OK? It's you.

654
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,429
You're needy, jealous, manipulative.
I can't take it anymore.

655
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,512
- It's crazy.
- Don't call me crazy!

656
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:09,149
See? That's the kind of thing I'm talking
about. I can't handle that on a daily basis.

657
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,310
Well, handle this.

658
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,518
What are you doing?!

659
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:26,072
You are so gonna regret this.

660
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,391
Oh, man.

661
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,477
- Wednesday? Thursday?
- No. No.

662
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,677
Friday? Saturday? Sunday?
Brunch? In the day?

663
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,751
Don't speak to me.

664
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,994
Oh, well. Look at it this way.

665
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,310
The hard part is over.

666
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,595
I don't know. She said I'd regret it.

667
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,555
Don't worry about that. They always say that.

668
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,392
Yeah?

669
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,471
I guess you're right.

670
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:12,071
You know, there's something that I've been
dying to tell you ever since I found it out.

671
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,833
- Found out what?
- I just need you to promise me...

672
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,832
- I promise.
- Hold on, let me finish, this is serious.

673
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:23,916
- I need you to promise me that you're not...
- I promise. I won't tell anybody. Tell me.

674
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,428
You know Jenny?

675
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,511
Yeah.

676
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,231
She's G-Girl.

677
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,271
Bullshit.

678
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,149
Bullshit.

679
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:50,277
Apparently, this old dog
still has a few tricks left.

680
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,352
Oh, my God, you have been doing G-Girl!

681
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,079
- I know! It's unbelievable. Me.
- Incredible.

682
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,878
- I can't believe it.
- Knuckles.

683
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,872
Imagine the heat I'll have
with the women when they find out.

684
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,839
Wait. Whoa. Isn't she gonna mind
you revealing her secret identity?

685
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,753
I warned you, Matt Saunders!

686
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,192
No!

687
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,629
Watch it, dumb-ass!

688
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,712
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

689
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,837
What could be wrong?
Everything's great. Never better.

690
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,876
Tell me.

691
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:00,878
OK. I, uh... I broke up with Jenny.

692
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,511
You were right. I mean, she is
totally deranged, off-her-rocker crazy.

693
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,751
I should have listened to you
from the beginning.

694
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,832
Why don't you lay off
the crazy women for a while, huh?

695
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,514
Come here. I'm sorry.

696
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,591
Hey, Hannah.

697
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,115
There's been something that I've been
meaning to tell you for a long time.

698
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,191
Yes?

699
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,157
It's about you and...

700
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,711
- Sorry. Are you OK?
- Out. Now.

701
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,916
I'm going through a weird phase.

702
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,355
- I saw that!
- What? No, it was nothing, Carla.

703
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,954
Nothing? You knocked her down! You hit her!

704
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:43,113
- Was there groping? Did he grope you?
- No, it was an accident.

705
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,191
An accident? OK, like a fender-bender?

706
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,953
Here, we need to talk. Come here.

707
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:53,557
Listen, my friend.
You are headed for some serious trouble.

708
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,598
- Don't make excuses. That's the first mistake.
- OK.

709
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:00,912
You have got to get your mind out of the
gutter long enough to nail this presentation.

710
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,437
- I hear you, homegirl. I got it.
- What? What did you just call me?!

711
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,714
What? I don't know.

712
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:11,396
If the company doesn't get this project,
we're going to take a major hit.

713
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:14,392
You really have a problem. Call my therapist.

714
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,277
OK, I'll call him... her.

715
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,078
- Matt.
- What?

716
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,549
- Phone call.
- Oh, man.

717
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:25,717
That boy has a major case of the hornies.

718
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,639
Yeah?

719
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:33,076
There's the young kid that zooms around
in here. Did he do something?

720
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:36,835
- It's just up here.
- Looks like they broke in, fried the camera

721
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,115
and then blew a huge hole
through the wall.

722
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,431
- I've never seen nothing like it.
- Don't make no sense.

723
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:45,318
We got a lot of nice cars -
his is the only one they took.

724
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,038
Bitch.

725
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:52,831
Somebody went to a lot of trouble.
You know who could have done this?

726
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,229
No. No, I don't.

727
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:59,313
- Somebody with a grudge against you?
- Grudge? Against me?

728
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,154
No. No, I don't. I'm sorry.

729
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,435
- We'll let you know if it turns up.
- OK.

730
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:09,274
- Let's get to the paperwork.
- I wouldn't hold my breath on that, sir.

731
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,676
Gentlemen...

732
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:18,036
If you look closely, our model here...

733
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,111
What the hell...?

734
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,710
Oh, that's just great.

735
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,758
Oh, shit! I just got that fixed.

736
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:36,312
Sorry, just came to use your telescope.
Nice and dark, isn't it?

737
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,119
Wait a second. Is this all because of you?

738
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:43,910
Yep, that'd be me. Ah, yes.

739
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,230
There we go.

740
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,754
Come and have a look-see.

741
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:55,595
I don't see any...

742
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:05,675
- That's real mature.
- Save you a fortune in parking.

743
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,833
Why are you doing this to me?
I mean, you're supposed to be the good guy.

744
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,754
I am the good guy. You are the bad guy.

745
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,549
It's been a pleasure seeing you,
but I got a big day at the office tomorrow.

746
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:21,474
I've got an important presentation to make,
so I need to get some sleep.

747
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:26,554
I'm gonna have to say good night. You might
be the hottest girl I've ever gone out with,

748
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,474
but you wanna know something?
You're the craziest, hands down!

749
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,755
- Really?
- Aargh!

750
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:54,310
Dick?!

751
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,838
Will we begin soon?

752
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,435
I'm so sorry you've been kept waiting.
I apologize. It's very rude.

753
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,717
Just a few more minutes, please.

754
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:10,110
- Hi. Excuse me, hi.
- Glad you could join us.

755
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,794
Can you tell me why you're wearing a hat?

756
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,236
- No.
- Why am I not surprised?

757
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,869
- Hi. How are you?
- We can finally begin.

758
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,428
- Gentlemen, I give you Matt Saunders.
- You OK?

759
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,954
I'm fine. I'm fine.

760
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:26,634
OK, gentlemen...

761
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,912
OK. Our design integrates
classic architectural ideas

762
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,956
from the history of Chinese culture

763
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:40,591
and transforms them
into a contemporary 21st century esthetic.

764
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:44,673
But you can see clearly
that functionality has not been sac...

765
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,270
Sac...

766
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:57,033
Sacrificed, as you can see here
by the multiple entrances to the central

767
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,634
multipurpose courtyard area.

768
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:02,029
Exactly. Exactly. Right.

769
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,759
And with a total capacity for...

770
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,910
You are one sick bastard!

771
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,154
Oh, man. I am so, so sorry.

772
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,231
Thanks.

773
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:40,197
- You gotta laugh to keep from crying, right?
- Vaughn, shh!

774
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:41,679
Sorry.

775
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,355
Man, no woman's ever done that to me,
and I actually <i>am</i> a dick.

776
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:50,514
OK, all done.
I am so sorry that you got fired.

777
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,909
What happened in there?
Why did you...

778
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,913
It's hard to explain.
Let's just say it's a good time for me to leave.

779
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,073
- Where are you going?
- Don't know. Don't care.

780
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:06,075
Look, if there's something wrong,
I'd like to help.

781
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:12,793
Look, Hannah. Please just stay
as far away from me as possible, OK?

782
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,031
If something were to happen to you
because of me,

783
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,918
I wouldn't be able to live with myself.

784
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,196
Oh, damn!

785
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,790
May we come in?

786
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,871
Nice place.

787
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,314
You broke her heart, didn't you?

788
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,631
What do you need? Why are you here?
I'm in the middle of a project.

789
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:01,269
The same as you -
to get her out of my life for good.

790
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,635
I want you to help me neutralize her.

791
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:08,840
Hey, whatever she's done to me,
I'm not gonna help you kill her.

792
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:11,480
I didn't say "kill", I said "neutralize".

793
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:14,757
It's a neutral word.
"Kill" is "kill". This is Switzerland.

794
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:20,517
I have developed the means
of permanently stripping her of her powers.

795
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,153
No powers?

796
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:28,439
So she'd just be another average,
everyday, run-of-the-mill, crazy ex-girlfriend?

797
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,829
Yeah. That's gotta be better.

798
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:35,991
- So what would you want me to do?
- Draw her out into the open.

799
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:39,197
Help me get her when her guard is down,
when she's vulnerable.

800
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:43,831
Look, I don't mean to offend you,
but you have a reputation for doing things

801
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,275
that most people would consider to be...

802
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,032
No-nos?

803
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:49,269
Yes.

804
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:53,433
Yeah. Nothing to worry about. I'm retiring.

805
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,670
- From supervillainy?
- Yeah.

806
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,912
That's good. Look, if you're going to retire,
why not just forget about her?

807
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,468
That's what I'm gonna do.
I'm leaving town.

808
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:08,908
Because that woman, she just won't
leave me alone. She's obsessed with me.

809
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,834
She has harassed me at every turn
and she never, ever stops.

810
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:19,075
So when you finally realize that she is not the
woman who is ever going to forget about you,

811
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:22,758
- then you give me a call.
- OK.

812
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:24,831
All right?

813
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:31,437
Or you can email me
at "professorbedlam.com".

814
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,511
It's all one word.

815
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:40,791
I think I'll just, uh... give running away a try.

816
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:50,311
<i>It's Matt.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

817
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,632
<i>Matt, it's Hannah.</i>
<i>Are you there? Please pick up.</i>

818
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:59,191
<i>I... I need your help.</i>
<i>Something really bad's happened.</i>

819
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:03,919
- <i>Oh, God, I guess you're not there. Bye.</i>
- Hannah!

820
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,712
Who is it?

821
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,439
It's me, Matt. Open up.

822
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:35,399
Hannah. Are you OK?
What did she do to you? Is she here?

823
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:38,233
- Is who here?
- G-Girl!

824
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,788
G-Girl? Like the superhero?

825
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,075
Yeah, G-Girl the super...

826
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,231
Why did you call me?

827
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,958
- Steve was cheating on me.
- Oh, thank God.

828
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,270
What?

829
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,357
Thank God that you found out
sooner rather than later.

830
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,112
I am sorry.

831
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:03,909
Yeah, I caught him in bed
with another woman.

832
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,560
Actually, two other women.

833
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:10,952
Maybe three.
I don't know - I didn't really get a good look.

834
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,235
- Three?
- Yeah.

835
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:14,950
Wow.

836
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:20,273
Steve was so good-looking
and he loved jazz and rock-climbing.

837
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,715
He took me to nice places
and gave me multiple...

838
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:25,473
I don't really need to hear that.

839
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:35,111
The thing is,
I never really had any fun with him.

840
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:39,318
Not like I have with you.

841
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:43,473
You've been
a really good friend to me, Saunders.

842
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,991
Hannah, the thing is,

843
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,437
I don't wanna be just a friend any more.

844
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,715
- You don't?
- No.

845
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,876
Look...

846
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:03,117
Hannah, my life has been really crazy lately.

847
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:06,158
But it has made me realize
what's most important to me.

848
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:11,758
Seeing you at work every day, that was
always the thing I looked forward to the most.

849
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:16,914
You're the smartest,
most beautiful girl that I've ever met.

850
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:22,076
And I'm completely
and totally in love with you.

851
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:24,838
Oh.

852
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:48,520
Oh, that was great. Didn't hurt at all.

853
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:55,233
I probably shouldn't tell you this,
but this might be the best moment of my life.

854
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:58,073
That's not fair. I was gonna say that.

855
01:05:58,160 --> 01:05:59,593
Oh.

856
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,671
Hey! Sweetie!

857
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:07,279
Matt?

858
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:11,359
I hate you, Matt Saunders!

859
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,317
Get down!

860
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:54,237
Why did G-Girl throw a shark at us?

861
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,755
I can't tell you.

862
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:02,877
And she was so pissed off.
Have you done something?

863
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:05,394
- Are you in trouble?
- No. Well, yeah.

864
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,675
And as long as I'm here, so are you.

865
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,433
You gotta get outside the city.
Go someplace and hide.

866
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:13,353
San Diego. Tahiti. Utah.

867
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,874
No, not Utah, Utah sucks. Anywhere else.

868
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:18,554
But you gotta go someplace,
lay low for a while.

869
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,154
- I don't understand.
- Look.

870
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:25,597
If I ever see you again,
this will all be over, OK?

871
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,669
If?

872
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:30,751
Matt, wait.

873
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:04,953
- Oh, it's you.
- Come in. Wait here.

874
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:08,840
- Right here? Where?
- What? Right here.

875
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:11,718
- OK.
- Over there.

876
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,831
Wow.

877
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:42,112
Look, I'm here cos I need your help, OK?
I just need to know how we're gonna stop her.

878
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:47,832
I have spent the past ten years trying
to analyze the source of G-Girl's power.

879
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:51,196
It is a unique type of radiation
that permeates every cell of her body.

880
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:56,070
Yeah, I know about the meteor in high school.
She told me. I know.

881
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:58,151
- She told you that?
- Yeah.

882
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:01,549
Did she talk about me?

883
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:05,076
I mean, she said you guys were friends,
you had a falling out.

884
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:09,392
Bullshit! That meteorite
changed everything between us.

885
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:14,554
But now, I've got something
that will totally level the playing field.

886
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,795
That?

887
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,518
The rock?

888
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,433
No, the ham. Yes, the rock.

889
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:31,636
A special rock.
It was a rock that gave off the radiation.

890
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:35,076
I now have a rock
that will absorb the radiation.

891
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:38,874
So if you got Jenny
close enough to this thing...

892
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:42,999
It'll draw the radiation from her body,
sucking it out of her like a sponge.

893
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:46,516
Draining her of her powers permanently.

894
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:50,673
OK, so what do you need me for?
Why can't you just get her close to it?

895
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:53,399
With that superhearing of hers?

896
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:56,870
No, I need someone who can lure her to it.

897
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,554
Someone who she has no cause to fear.

898
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:02,518
A weak and powerless simpleton.

899
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:04,591
An idiot.

900
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:24,432
No, all of these invoices were
returned. None of them have been paid.

901
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:26,875
Call back.

902
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:31,830
And these two are supposed to be...

903
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,631
Hi.

904
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:43,195
Hi.

905
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,554
What's this?

906
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,393
It's just a little something
I thought I'd bring by...

907
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:49,152
- Flowers?
- Yeah.

908
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:53,028
You think flowers
are going to make me forgive you?

909
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:56,874
No. No, I do not think that.
I don't think that at all.

910
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:00,157
Then what the hell are you doing here?

911
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:06,839
OK, look. To be honest, I realize that
I've made the biggest mistake of my life.

912
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:13,109
I'm desperately in love with you and I'd
do anything for us to be together again.

913
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:20,511
I would.

914
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,871
Oh, God.

915
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,951
They're beautiful.

916
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:35,552
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

917
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:38,598
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

918
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:44,277
What do you think about today after work
you come by my place around seven

919
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:50,230
- and I'll make us a nice dinner?
- Seven? I'd love to.

920
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,631
Matt?

921
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,591
Matt?

922
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,269
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, Jenny.

923
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,636
Matt, it's beautiful.

924
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:33,678
Oh, what is that? Is that for me?

925
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,230
It is. It's a little something I got you cos...

926
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:40,676
I wanna apologize
for the terrible way that I've treated you.

927
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:44,116
- It just wasn't right.
- You're so sweet. You didn't have to.

928
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:46,475
- It's true, I'm sorry.
- What is it?

929
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:50,951
No peeking, OK? I want it
to be a surprise. Let's have a toast.

930
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:53,600
You are amazing.

931
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:56,558
<i>To second chances.</i>

932
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,835
<i>To second chances.</i>

933
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:05,791
The man's not bad.
He might have a future in our business.

934
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,515
You know, deep down,

935
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:13,116
I had a feeling that you'd realize
your mistake and come back to me.

936
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:15,191
You are wise.

937
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:19,918
- Do you wanna know a secret?
- Sure.

938
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:25,994
That's why I didn't kill you.

939
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:50,868
Matt?

940
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,599
You are the sweetest guy I've ever met.

941
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:56,592
- Oh, no, no, I'm not.
- Yes, yes, you are.

942
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:00,034
You're sweet.

943
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,111
Yummy.

944
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,555
Matt?!

945
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,437
What are you doing here?

946
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,988
Me?! What are you doing here?

947
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:13,311
<i>You said your life was in danger.</i>
<i>And what's she doing here?</i>

948
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:16,312
- Who's that? Do we know her?
- I don't know her.

949
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:17,549
I don't know her.

950
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:22,668
You know how you tried to steal my
boyfriend by being such a big, fat whore?

951
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:25,274
- It didn't work.
- Jenny, stop. Let me handle this.

952
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,759
- Are you back with her?
- No.

953
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:28,831
- What?
- Yeah.

954
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:31,878
Look, it's very complicated, OK?

955
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,679
How could you do this?
You told me you loved me.

956
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:37,593
Hannah, please, just do me a favor, OK?
Just leave.

957
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:41,719
I mean, just try to have a little self-respect.
You're starting to look pathetic.

958
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:47,318
Matt! You are not... Oh, my God. There you
are. Thank God. I've been calling you all day.

959
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,994
Playoff tickets. Amazing seats. You and me.

960
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:52,674
- Not now.
- Tonight. Third base line. Yahoo!

961
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:56,070
- Now is a terrible time, OK?
- Hey, what's in the box?

962
01:14:56,160 --> 01:15:00,631
- Stay away from that box.
- You know, Hannah,

963
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:04,599
why don't you just run along before I have
to kick your ass back to Munchkin Land?

964
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:07,592
- Stay away from it.
- It looks big, it might be a nice present.

965
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:11,468
- Are you threatening me?
- Push me one more time and you'll find out.

966
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:15,678
Oh, yeah? What are you going to do?
Squash me with your gigantic feet?

967
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:18,479
- That's it!
- Don't touch me!

968
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,118
Just do me a favor and leave
and take Hannah with you...

969
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:28,110
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God! You're G-Girl.

970
01:15:28,680 --> 01:15:30,955
You have been doing G-Girl?

971
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:35,753
- Vaughn, open the box!
- Go! Go! Go! Watch the van!

972
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,510
Open the damn box!

973
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:43,039
Aargh!

974
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:46,430
- It's not much of a present.
- Agh!

975
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:48,511
I'm sorry.

976
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,111
You bastard!

977
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:04,479
Matt, that's a weird rock.

978
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,879
Ah.

979
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:09,919
A happy ending for everybody.
Well done, Mr. Saunders.

980
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,753
You did this? You helped him?

981
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:17,152
I'm really sorry.
You did throw a shark at me, you know.

982
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:20,915
Besides, Bedlam's gonna retire. It'll be OK.

983
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:23,472
You idiot!

984
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:28,637
Looks like you're done, honey.

985
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:33,316
You always thought
you were so much better than me.

986
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:35,197
Now it's my turn.

987
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:38,431
Now I'll be the one with the powers.

988
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:41,592
You'll be just plain old Jenny Johnson.

989
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:45,193
We're having a moment here.

990
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:51,954
- Not so tough now, huh?!
- Hannah, don't let her touch the rock!

991
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:07,110
Hannah!

992
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,239
Oh, no! Hannah!

993
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:15,428
I can't even see her. We gotta get down there.

994
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:17,511
Oh, man!

995
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:20,396
I think she's dead, Matt.

996
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:23,153
- I'm sorry. Let her go.
- We gotta dig her out!

997
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:26,471
- We gotta start the grieving process.
- Are you crazy?

998
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:29,028
- Come here. Give me a hug, bear cub.
- You!

999
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,554
I thought you were just a jerk!

1000
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:35,915
Now I find out you're really stupid.

1001
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,150
Teaming up with Barry?!

1002
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:49,196
You broke my heart
and now I'm gonna break your everything.

1003
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:54,751
Hey!

1004
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:57,559
Let go of my boyfriend, you crazy bitch!

1005
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,994
Bring it!

1006
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:08,076
Oh, man!

1007
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:10,515
Yes, girl fight!

1008
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:13,037
Stupid!

1009
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,036
Matt!

1010
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:25,151
No!

1011
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,512
Hannah!

1012
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,158
Hannah, are you OK?

1013
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,638
Oh, no!

1014
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,550
You rat!

1015
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:48,071
Oh, Matt. Matt, Matt, are you OK?

1016
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,311
Uh-oh.

1017
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,991
Wow!

1018
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,435
Hannah, stop. Come on, stop.

1019
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:20,953
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

1020
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:24,112
I'm fine too. I thought I twinged my knee,
but I'm all right.

1021
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:27,795
Come on. Forget about them. Let's go.

1022
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:30,030
Come on.

1023
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:35,550
They're gonna kill each other. This way.

1024
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:40,632
- Hey, it's you.
- Are you with them?

1025
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:42,711
As a matter of fact, I am.

1026
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:46,035
They went down there.

1027
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,068
Stop!

1028
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:10,439
Look at yourself.
You're terrifying these people.

1029
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:18,031
Jenny... Jenny,
this has gotta stop right now, OK?

1030
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:19,553
Please.

1031
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:21,995
Just give me that, OK?

1032
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,514
There you go. Just give it to me.

1033
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:28,229
Wow. That was a lot heavier than I thought.

1034
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:31,356
Hi.

1035
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:36,070
Look, God knows
I don't want you mad at me, OK?

1036
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:38,594
And I'm sorry if I ever hurt you.

1037
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:42,593
And yeah, I know what we had
was something special.

1038
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:44,910
And at times it was great.

1039
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:49,869
But it wasn't love, all right?
And deep down, you know that.

1040
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:56,239
You're a great girl.
And you deserve to be with the perfect guy.

1041
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,992
- You do.
- I do.

1042
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:03,279
And I know who the perfect guy for you is.
And he's here, right here, right now.

1043
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,351
Professor.

1044
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,070
- What?
- Barry?

1045
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:13,434
- Go on, Professor, tell her.
- Tell her what?

1046
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:16,273
She's my mortal enemy?
I want nothing but her destruction?

1047
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:21,309
- Come on, Barry, please.
- Please stop calling me Barry.

1048
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:25,029
It's true. This guy,
he's got a shrine to you in his house.

1049
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:28,715
There are pictures of you
all over the walls, just of you.

1050
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:32,156
This guy, he is hooked on you.
He really is.

1051
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:35,594
Is that true?

1052
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:46,514
Come on. You gotta open your heart to her.
It's now or never.

1053
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:49,353
It may be a little true.

1054
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:56,115
OK, OK, that's a good start.
Come on, Barry. Barry, come on.

1055
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:58,714
All right, all right!

1056
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,791
It's completely true.

1057
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:04,794
I love you.

1058
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:07,678
I've always loved you.

1059
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:12,151
But if you love me so much, then how come
you're always trying to hurt me?

1060
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:17,360
Because you hurt me. Because you
broke my heart into a billion pieces.

1061
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:20,193
You ignored me.

1062
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:22,271
You left me behind.

1063
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:29,797
So I thought if I had the powers,
you may learn to love me

1064
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:33,111
the way I have always loved you.

1065
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:39,231
Are you sure?

1066
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,676
Do you really love me?

1067
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:48,790
Oh, yeah.

1068
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:03,192
It's over. Can you believe it?
I'm free. You were great.

1069
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:04,759
I can't believe that fight.

1070
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:07,798
I still think she'd kick my butt,
but I got a few good punches in.

1071
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:10,838
You saved my ass in there.
You were wonderful.

1072
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:13,957
And I'm really sorry
I didn't explain things to you sooner,

1073
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:18,431
- but I was just trying to protect you.
- I totally understand.

1074
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:19,589
Good.

1075
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:23,559
- Oh, my God, my hair.
- Oh, it doesn't look that bad. You can fix it.

1076
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:25,517
Here, try this on.

1077
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,397
Thanks.

1078
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:31,154
See? Adorable.

1079
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:33,435
- Yes, you are.
- No, not me.

1080
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:36,193
- Come here.
- Agh!

1081
01:23:36,280 --> 01:23:37,952
- Tight.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

1082
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:41,589
- It's OK.
- I'm still getting used to all of this.

1083
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:47,437
You and me both. And you know, we're going
to have to talk about the relationship too.

1084
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:51,229
- Talk? You mean...
- Your powers.

1085
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:55,996
Just cos you have 'em doesn't mean
you have to use 'em, you know what I mean?

1086
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:59,072
You're a little scared of me.

1087
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:01,958
What? Scared?
No, come on, I'm not scared at all.

1088
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:04,031
Come here.

1089
01:24:12,760 --> 01:24:14,557
Are you ready?

1090
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:18,758
Yeah! I am. I'm ready.

1091
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:21,354
OK. Here we go.

1092
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:27,915
OK, all right, I got it.

1093
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:38,997
- Hold on, I think I tweaked something.
- Oh, you poor baby.

1094
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,836
What the hell were you doing?!

1095
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:55,036
Sorry. Sorry.

1096
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:08,990
Oh.

1097
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:12,595
I brought it down for you.
Peace offering.

1098
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:20,238
You've done so much for us.
We couldn't be happier.

1099
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,788
- How...? How...?
- Asteroids.

1100
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:26,111
Most of that will just buff right out.

1101
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:33,194
- I'll fix that.
- I could trick it out for you.

1102
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:36,636
Rocket launchers, laser cannons,
voice-activated battle armor.

1103
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,870
Do you hear something?

1104
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,315
- No.
- There's a 747 in trouble.

1105
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:43,994
It's a 727. Time to go to work.

1106
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:47,349
You need a hand?

1107
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:50,669
- A hand?
- Yeah, any help?

1108
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:54,353
I never had any help.

1109
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:56,908
- Could be some heavy lifting.
- Yeah?

1110
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,797
- OK.
- Yeah? Really?

1111
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:02,509
- Yes.
- Yes! All right! Whoo!

1112
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,915
OK, ready. Whoo! Here I go.

1113
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:16,597
Yeah!

1114
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:20,358
- Love you, honey!
- We'll be waiting!

1115
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:26,159
What are we gonna do with this stuff?
Wanna get a beer?

1116
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:28,310
- Sure.
- Let's do it.

1117
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:29,508
My God! You really do have superpowers.

1118
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:33,036
Yeah. Well, it helps
when you haven't used them

1119
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:39,389
in two years, three months,
one week and four days.

1120
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:43,234
OK, now. I got one more in me. Here we go.

1121
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:31,196
