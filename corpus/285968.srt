1
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:14,659
I looked up all the documents from
before you were adopted.

2
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,065
Before you were adopted,

3
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:22,603
you were reported as an orphan.

4
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:26,571
I went to the neighborhood and asked around.

5
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:32,178
Luckily, there was a woman who remembered you.

6
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:41,023
Thank you very much.
I'll never forget your help.

7
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:46,696
Hey, you bitch!
Where the hell do you think you're going?

8
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,734
- Pay up...
- Let go, you bitch!

9
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:55,469
Why you, bitch!
You're stealing a zipper that’s only a dollar?

10
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,734
Is this the way you sew on a zipper?

11
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:02,307
Of course, this is the way!
How else, bitch?

12
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:16,217
She's the one I told you about!

13
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,748
Ugh... dumb, fat bitch... huh.

14
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:49,589
Scratching a person's face like this.

15
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:58,626
Hello.

16
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:06,201
This is the man I told you about.

17
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:15,615
- Then... this is... Jin-woo?
- Yes.

18
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,937
I wanted to see you because

19
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,905
there's something you should know.

20
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,048
Sit, sit here.

21
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:53,652
I was hoping to have this time with you some day.

22
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:59,698
It's a long story...

23
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:14,035
Today, commentator Bang speaks
about the Kwangjoo incident.

24
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,110
Hello. This is Young-jin Bang

25
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,850
Today, I'd like to talk about

26
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:21,012
the military that has entered Kwangjoo.

27
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,853
The difficulties the military had

28
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:27,689
in stabilizing the crisis is well known.

29
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,793
The military under martial law worked hard

30
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,857
to bring it under control.

31
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:39,595
It is well understood that it was

32
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,570
hard for the military to protect

33
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:46,510
the innocent majority of Kwangjoo
who are citizens of this country.

34
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:52,876
Thus the army acted cautiously.

35
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:57,349
We will not forget their endeavors.

36
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,683
The Martial Law headquarters released

37
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:02,024
its report on the Kwangjoo riot today.

38
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,325
According to the report,

39
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,395
there were 33 main instigators,

40
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,398
30 who attacked the prisons,
33 looters who also set fires,

41
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:15,005
174 who left the main party,
10 who spread rumors,

42
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:18,572
and 74 who participated in demonstrations or riot

43
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:47,501
"The river is flowing... Underneath
the Third Han Bridge..."

44
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:39,647
Hey

45
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,418
Did you see the guy who moved
into the second floor?

46
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,088
He looks real elegant

47
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:51,226
His fingers are white and really long

48
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,397
What good are pretty hands, you fool

49
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:59,535
Look at Kyung-chul. He easily makes
10 bucks a day.

50
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,673
Ugh... whatever. Who cares if he’s a good worker

51
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,740
You crazy bitch!
Then what's great about pretty hands?

52
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,879
What's he gonna use them for

53
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:13,744
You haven't got a clue... A fool,
that's what you are.

54
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:18,682
Ki-ok, all you do is curse

55
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,622
Stop it.

56
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:21,585
It's irritating.

57
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,793
Huh! Am I wrong?

58
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,562
It's not like his thing is pretty.

59
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,292
Who cares about his hands, right?

60
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:35,198
Ki-ok! You do know something, don't you?

61
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,806
You go, girl!

62
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,904
Ugh... I'm sick of this neighborhood

63
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:43,045
I've gotta get out of here.

64
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,379
So let's get out together, okay?

65
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,120
They say the discomfort index is high today.

66
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,620
But I can't tell.

67
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,655
Just like I don't know about pleasure,

68
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,896
I don't know about discomfort either.

69
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:49,565
I'm just used to this space.

70
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:34,011
I couldn't take such humid weather before.

71
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,117
But once you get used to it,
it feels comfortable.

72
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,989
That's life for me.

73
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,496
The fact that there's nothing for me
to do is also comfortable.

74
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,168
I just have to live.

75
00:12:55,541 --> 00:13:01,309
It's okay to just feel alive every now and then

76
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:20,374
So many fucking bills.
And no one who cares. Dammit...

77
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,870
You should've told me before if it fell out

78
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,446
You gotta take care of these things right away

79
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,647
I fixed it good now.

80
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,021
- When are you going to paint this?
- Soon.

81
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:04,262
- Dammit! Get over here!
- Oh... at it again, those crazy fools.

82
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:09,804
Hurry, it's your move

83
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,939
Why are you so slow

84
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:28,288
What kind of move is that

85
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,892
- Who says you're a great player, huh?
- Move your 'cha,"cha, '...

86
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,694
What do you mean 'cha? ' I win if I do this

87
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:43,668
Give it, give it

88
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,506
The girls at the teahouse in front

89
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,507
they smoke really cool.

90
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:51,513
How

91
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,047
Look at you...

92
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:58,122
- But where do you hide your ciggies?
- My cigarettes?

93
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:00,517
Wo

94
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,088
Plan on working at a match factory

95
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,354
- Let me see.
- What the hell...

96
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,663
Dammit! I stepped on shit! Yuck

97
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,909
What's the ring for

98
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:23,440
You know. It's Detective Im's son's first birthday

99
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,416
He has all the luck

100
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,342
Gets promoted...

101
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:37,454
You know what

102
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:40,793
I think I'm gonna get my job back soon

103
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:44,632
They know I took the fall for them

104
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,900
that I didn't do it.

105
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:58,879
Just wait a little.
They said they'd call me back

106
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,580
Our troubles are over

107
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:05,789
We'll live like we used to

108
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:07,490
I'm confident

109
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:09,593
Just be patient

110
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,657
We'll get out of this shitty neighborhood...

111
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:30,707
"Who said love was beautiful...

112
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:47,056
"Rather, rather... Put me to sleep with
your empty hands."

113
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,715
I went to a friend's house yesterday

114
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,145
His sister was sleeping

115
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:19,594
I put my hands under her skirt

116
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,064
Crazy bastard

117
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,713
Who the hell

118
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:41,141
I'll kill you

119
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:54,597
You! It was you, right? Stupid bastard

120
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,565
Look! Look! Crazy bastard... Dammit...

121
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,000
Shit

122
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,702
Who put this...

123
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:50,080
Wait till I get my hands on you...

124
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:55,450
Fresh cabbages

125
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:58,913
Fresh cabbages from Kangwon

126
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,325
If I catch the bastard,
I'll stick his head in the can.

127
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:09,096
- What kind of sick pig peeks at that?
- Exactly.

128
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,460
Hey, are you talking to us

129
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:16,205
Mr. Park, I beg you,
change the bathroom door.

130
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:17,998
Why me

131
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:24,849
Plus, today's a holiday.
Why'd you come here?

132
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:28,079
Why don't you go use your own bathroom...

133
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,778
I won't mention names but there's a price

134
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:33,422
who's ruining the neighborhood

135
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:37,155
You can't even take a dump
in our own neighborhood.

136
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:39,920
When I catch him, I'll fuck his life up good

137
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:43,429
What? Fuck his life up?
Don't talk like that, Ki-ok

138
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:48,167
Fuck up his life cause he saw her take a dump

139
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:50,536
Is that a thing to say

140
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:54,975
I'm not being mean.
That's how the world is today.

141
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:59,410
Say the wrong thing and they'll tear you apart

142
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:02,816
Peeking into the bathroom,
that's a crime! A big one!

143
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:07,149
Im... im... Young-mi

144
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:11,050
What was that in the papers a few days back

145
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,128
Immoral behavior?

146
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:16,626
The thing that they're trying to set an example with?

147
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:20,234
That's it! Immoral behavior!
Set an example.

148
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:22,237
What? What? What'd you say

149
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,905
Well, you know... I don't wanna b

150
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:26,536
too mean living in the same neighborhood.

151
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:30,679
But there's a bastard who doesn't seem to get it

152
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:34,080
And if that's the case,
you're part of the problem, too.

153
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,344
Boy, you're so smart, aren't you

154
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:38,714
I don't get a word you said.

155
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:40,281
What? Set what

156
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:44,159
Set an example!
You don't need to get it all.

157
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:45,954
If you don't want to be dragged of

158
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,760
and tortured then watch out.

159
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:50,124
It's a scary world right now

160
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,864
Let's go. Peeking into the bathroom...

161
00:27:53,071 --> 00:28:01,035
What? What? Torture?
Man... She's so full of herself...

162
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:48,142
These mosquitoes are driving me crazy

163
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:56,551
Why aren't you sleeping? Come here

164
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:58,152
I'm gonna steam some yams

165
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:00,388
Don't pee there. Go over there

166
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:15,962
"My love who has left me"

167
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:23,473
"if I could only meet him today..."

168
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:33,276
"With my tired lips, I can tell you all about it.

169
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:39,249
Where is everybody

170
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:48,721
"...I've lived, unaware of the world.

171
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,484
How far are you going to follow me

172
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:14,120
Wanna go see the circus?
I happen to have two tickets.

173
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,351
No thanks

174
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,494
- Can I see your place?
- No!

175
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,896
Oh... how about tomorrow night at 8

176
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:28,669
Okay

177
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:43,044
"The river is flowing..."

178
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:01,905
Cut it out

179
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:06,907
"I'm so... fucking embarrassed.

180
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:08,844
Hey! What is that

181
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:11,747
Do we always gotta listen to country

182
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:14,250
Let's get some culture.

183
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:17,648
Crazy bastard. Do you even know the title

184
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:22,417
You making fun of me

185
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:27,663
It was as popular as Paul Anka, Diana

186
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:29,657
Do you even know that

187
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:34,700
"I'm so... fucking embarrassed."

188
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:36,864
Sure, no matter what you spit out

189
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:39,341
no bitch here can understand you.

190
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:43,010
We have nothing to do with English
except for 'thank you. '

191
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:46,843
What

192
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:49,612
What

193
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:55,153
I'm telling you it's something like Diana

194
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,261
Are you crazy? Hey

195
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,022
Polka Inca, Diamond, whatever

196
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,590
what the hell are you throwing at me

197
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:07,903
Dammit... Hey! Pick that up! Pick it up

198
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:14,806
Well... you were laughing at me... That's why...

199
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,890
I'm out of here

200
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,684
Hey! Where are you going

201
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:33,322
What are the torture camps doing?
Not taking that one...

202
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:36,331
What did you say? Bitch...

203
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:37,800
You brat, you out of your mind

204
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:41,169
We've a big load to send out in two days

205
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:47,901
Did you even do your job

206
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:54,583
- Kyung-chul.
- Yes.

207
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,415
Is this a dance hall

208
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:01,150
What are you doing

209
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,087
Stop being full of yourself an

210
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,095
undo these stitches, will ya?

211
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:39,250
I'm sorry. It's just that...

212
00:47:39,556 --> 00:47:43,515
...you're so beautiful.

213
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:46,492
It was you the last time too, wasn't it

214
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:02,325
You always look so lonely

215
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:12,041
Why doesn't your husband look at you

216
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:17,203
How do you know that

217
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,419
Over there

218
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:52,046
I'm sorry I couldn't make it last time

219
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,881
I had to work overtime.

220
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:58,312
Do you work in the factory out front

221
00:50:58,488 --> 00:50:59,716
I'm just a low-level worker right no

222
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:02,182
but one day, I'll have my own store

223
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:05,953
I have a savings account, too. In a few years,
I'll have enough.

224
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:09,596
I'm different from the people around here

225
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:12,864
- Some thread here...
- What are you doing?

226
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:19,370
It must've gotten there at work. I had to do a lot today

227
00:51:20,977 --> 00:51:22,467
Do I have any on my back

228
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:26,109
- Yes...
- Could you take them off?

229
00:51:27,884 --> 00:51:29,078
Sure

230
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:09,028
Get that bastard! Get him

231
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:10,738
You bastard

232
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:15,303
Hey! Hey, you dick

233
01:00:15,845 --> 01:00:20,612
Grab that guy for me! You bastard

234
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:23,608
What's wrong with you

235
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:29,855
Get him

236
01:00:33,096 --> 01:00:36,657
Crazy bastard! Come out! Come out

237
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:40,993
Move, you fucking bastard

238
01:00:42,205 --> 01:00:44,969
Should I kill you or cripple you, you son of a bitch

239
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:49,303
Fucking asshole, you think you're still a cop?
Huh?

240
01:00:49,545 --> 01:00:51,172
Stinking security guard

241
01:00:58,755 --> 01:01:00,746
Don't shoot

242
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:04,152
Don't shoot

243
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:09,626
Calm down. Calm down.
What's wrong with everybody?

244
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:12,891
We're neighbors. Why do this

245
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:15,361
Calm down...

246
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:35,789
Ki-ok, what's going on

247
01:01:36,959 --> 01:01:38,984
Don't cry. Tell me

248
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:45,661
Why I... I was taking a dump an

249
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:51,163
I saw this bastard's eyes through the door.

250
01:01:51,974 --> 01:01:54,306
Fucking bastard! This is all your fault

251
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:56,208
I told you to change the bathroom door

252
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:57,610
And you didn't!

253
01:01:57,647 --> 01:01:59,171
What? Why is that my fault

254
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:04,984
- I lost a lot of hair, right?
- I can't tell.

255
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:10,885
You think that's all?
That dickhead tried to rape me.

256
01:02:10,927 --> 01:02:14,294
Shit! When did I

257
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:16,422
You think I have no bitch to have that I'd do you? Fuck

258
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:21,000
- What'd you say, dick!
- Why are you guys doing this?

259
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:25,766
Fucking pisses me off when I think of lying by that shithole!

260
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:29,867
Scum, you gotta push me down there, huh?

261
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:31,277
Dirty pig! Fuckin' ass!

262
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:34,245
Alright, I hear you. Let's go.

263
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:36,679
We'll need your statement, too.

264
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:38,380
Come on!

265
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:40,053
Do I go too?

266
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:43,391
Rape's a crime by complaint. Let's go.

267
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:46,589
Wait. There's no need...

268
01:02:47,363 --> 01:02:50,821
Dammit, rape's a serious complaint.
We gotta to report it.

269
01:02:52,168 --> 01:02:56,662
Um, thanks for catching him
but you don't seem to understand.

270
01:02:56,706 --> 01:02:57,934
Pisses me off just living in the

271
01:02:58,474 --> 01:03:03,969
same neighborhood with this crazy bastard.

272
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,104
But compliment? Young-mi,

273
01:03:05,148 --> 01:03:07,116
did I ever compliment this asshole?

274
01:03:07,316 --> 01:03:08,647
She never did.

275
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:11,786
This crime is no compliment, it's not.

276
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:14,080
Who said it was a compliment?

277
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:16,518
I meant, you have to file a complaint.

278
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:20,290
- You get it now?
- Man...

279
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:23,432
You crazy bastard, you think this is funny?

280
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:26,667
Enough. You see... it's hot

281
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:28,760
and he's young, his blood boils...

282
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:30,102
It doesn't matter.

283
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:31,500
You, follow me. To the station.

284
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:33,372
Ki-ok, come a little later.

285
01:04:44,513 --> 01:04:45,878
Who is it

286
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:19,392
Your husband seems very insecure

287
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:28,033
But how did you two meet

288
01:08:34,176 --> 01:08:36,007
I want to know

289
01:08:39,348 --> 01:08:43,284
My father was suspected of having ties
to the student movement.

290
01:08:45,855 --> 01:08:47,914
It must've been because he le

291
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:53,125
his students hide out in his attic.

292
01:08:59,502 --> 01:09:01,094
He had to leave the school

293
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,838
And he went into hiding

294
01:11:07,963 --> 01:11:10,193
I asked my husband a few time

295
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,300
but he says he doesn't know either...

296
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:16,863
He's probably passed away

297
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:23,770
Do you ever... want a different life

298
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:27,347
Different

299
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:35,753
You can leave here and go somewhere else

300
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:41,455
It's the same everywhere

301
01:11:49,271 --> 01:11:51,466
Hide under the bed, hurry

302
01:11:51,507 --> 01:11:52,804
One second

303
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:58,002
I'm coming

304
01:12:16,965 --> 01:12:19,798
I bought a cake. Let's eat it together

305
01:12:35,284 --> 01:12:38,117
Why is the bed so messy

306
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:41,247
I must've moved around in my sleep

307
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:54,869
Let's eat it tomorrow

308
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:04,544
Sure...

309
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:08,148
Your birthday's tomorrow anyway

310
01:13:28,103 --> 01:13:30,435
Aren't you... going to work today

311
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:35,002
I can go in a little late

312
01:13:39,148 --> 01:13:41,013
I feel sluggish

313
01:13:43,786 --> 01:13:45,879
Just a quickie and I'll go

314
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:17,846
What's with you today

315
01:14:19,555 --> 01:14:21,045
I'm really tired, too

316
01:17:19,534 --> 01:17:21,229
Did something happen

317
01:17:26,775 --> 01:17:29,972
Why am I the only who got fired

318
01:17:32,414 --> 01:17:35,713
The bastard who took more than
I did got a promotion...

319
01:17:40,455 --> 01:17:45,586
I don't think I'm getting my job back

320
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:51,189
It sounded like I would just a while ago

321
01:17:55,103 --> 01:18:00,541
How... how did I end up this way

322
01:18:02,411 --> 01:18:04,311
Where did you hear this

323
01:18:07,282 --> 01:18:09,375
Today at the station...

324
01:18:22,597 --> 01:18:24,497
You can't leave me...

325
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:28,397
You do know... you're all that I have

326
01:18:30,739 --> 01:18:32,468
Do whatever you want

327
01:18:35,577 --> 01:18:37,408
Just don't leave me

328
01:18:38,113 --> 01:18:39,705
That's all

329
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:43,518
You can do that, right

330
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:08,133
Happy birthday

331
01:19:09,377 --> 01:19:11,004
Thank you

332
01:19:12,781 --> 01:19:14,271
Blow them out

333
01:19:25,827 --> 01:19:28,625
When did you stop ballet

334
01:19:33,135 --> 01:19:37,094
I saw your toe shoes under the bed

335
01:19:40,008 --> 01:19:41,737
In high school

336
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:48,142
I've never seen the ballet

337
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:53,685
I'd like to see you dancing once wearing a tutu

338
01:20:07,602 --> 01:20:09,433
Open wide

339
01:20:13,775 --> 01:20:19,077
Not like that. Open wide. Like this

340
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:48,908
Actually, I'm wanted

341
01:20:52,447 --> 01:20:54,074
It doesn't matter

342
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:02,417
I was going to leave once things settled down

343
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:04,757
But I've lost all contact

344
01:21:05,293 --> 01:21:07,284
My friends must've been all arrested

345
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:12,129
I don't think I can stay here

346
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:22,668
I have to leave here soon

347
01:21:28,483 --> 01:21:29,916
Come with me

348
01:21:56,978 --> 01:21:58,639
Is she seeing someone these days

349
01:21:58,947 --> 01:22:01,814
Hey, looking good today!
Where are you going?

350
01:22:02,183 --> 01:22:03,275
Whatever

351
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,252
What a snot! Fine...

352
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:18,529
Oh, you're home. I knew you'd be

353
01:22:19,367 --> 01:22:23,827
Wow, it's nice out today.
Let's go downtown together.

354
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:27,666
I know a great place.
Their pork cutlet's really good.

355
01:22:27,709 --> 01:22:30,473
Let's go. My treat. Come on.

356
01:22:30,645 --> 01:22:33,910
I have to get my laundry
and I have a lot to do...

357
01:22:43,825 --> 01:22:46,385
Sorry. Let's go next time.

358
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:50,059
Are you really gonna be like this?

359
01:23:07,415 --> 01:23:12,648
Young-mi, this is for your own good.

360
01:23:13,254 --> 01:23:19,159
He's going to hurt you.

361
01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:21,386
Ki-ok, leave me alone.

362
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:26,498
Hey. I'm looking out for you.

363
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:30,938
Do you know what kind of guy he is? Do you?

364
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,400
Oh, Young-mi...

365
01:23:35,176 --> 01:23:38,634
I'm begging you, don't worry about me.
You bug me.

366
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:40,214
Hey

367
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:43,241
You know what?

368
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:49,347
Taking someone else's girl is the best.

369
01:23:50,125 --> 01:23:54,027
When you having so much fun, it makes you blind,

370
01:23:54,162 --> 01:23:55,356
get it?

371
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:57,195
What are you saying?

372
01:23:57,499 --> 01:24:01,731
- What I mean is...
- Hello.

373
01:24:02,837 --> 01:24:04,930
You've waited long for today.

374
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:06,031
Yes. Today, let's get plastered.

375
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:08,865
I'm treating big tonight, okay?

376
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:14,547
Bastard, when are you not plastered?

377
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:16,411
I'm trying to have a serious talk

378
01:24:16,785 --> 01:24:19,652
Let's get plastered again, my ass...

379
01:24:19,988 --> 01:24:24,049
Come on, Ki-ok... I'm treating

380
01:24:24,325 --> 01:24:26,919
You gonna be that way, huh?

381
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:31,162
Hey, aren't you spending too much

382
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:35,831
What do you mean too much?
It's just a few bottles.

383
01:24:36,304 --> 01:24:37,703
I just gotta work 20 days to make

384
01:24:38,006 --> 01:24:40,031
what a guy usually makes in a month

385
01:24:40,408 --> 01:24:44,708
10 bucks a day? If I wanted to,
I can make 15, 15.

386
01:24:44,946 --> 01:24:47,039
Alright, big shot

387
01:24:47,649 --> 01:24:55,886
Young-mi, oh...
"I'm so your... and you so... It's, I..."

388
01:24:56,691 --> 01:25:01,492
Hey, is that the only song you know

389
01:25:01,629 --> 01:25:03,563
Why are you hitting me

390
01:25:03,731 --> 01:25:06,256
Man, sing another one

391
01:25:06,501 --> 01:25:08,799
I've heard that so many times

392
01:25:08,837 --> 01:25:10,361
I can sing it better. Sing something else

393
01:25:10,638 --> 01:25:13,471
Then you do one. Do one. Go ahead

394
01:25:13,508 --> 01:25:14,941
Me

395
01:25:15,076 --> 01:25:18,239
- Go ahead, go ahead.
- Sure. I'll do one.

396
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:34,560
"Oh... I'm so your..."

397
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:45,335
Hey, you gotta watch me at least!

398
01:25:45,373 --> 01:25:47,068
Oh, okay, okay. Nice, nice.

399
01:25:47,108 --> 01:25:55,538
"I'm so... can't stop me... Night of Shilla..."

400
01:25:55,750 --> 01:26:00,813
Look, look, you're shaking your squid leg too much

401
01:26:24,579 --> 01:26:29,642
I... leave tomorrow.

402
01:26:34,289 --> 01:26:39,352
It's not like I was a core member of the movement.

403
01:26:40,929 --> 01:26:45,332
I participated after watching my friends get hurt

404
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:49,693
and then went on the run.

405
01:26:58,046 --> 01:27:04,007
I've been really happy.

406
01:27:07,956 --> 01:27:11,756
I haven't been any help to you, Sang-ho...

407
01:27:14,562 --> 01:27:19,090
It was short but I was happy

408
01:27:20,134 --> 01:27:22,364
to share a moment of freedom.

409
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:38,484
I'll never forget you

410
01:27:42,657 --> 01:27:43,419
- Mr. Im!
- Yes?

411
01:27:43,625 --> 01:27:45,593
Come on over. Good work in this heat. Here,
take a swig.

412
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:46,790
Thanks

413
01:27:48,129 --> 01:27:52,031
Really cool, don't you think? For you...

414
01:27:53,301 --> 01:27:57,260
Okay, Young-mi.
I'll tell you a fun puzzle, puzzle.

415
01:28:21,195 --> 01:28:24,687
"My love cries while holding me...

416
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:29,494
Don't stop me from leaving..."

417
01:28:29,704 --> 01:28:34,334
(Stop the sun from setting!
Oh, oh... what to do?

418
01:28:37,478 --> 01:28:43,849
Trouble ahead, an enemy, an enemy...

419
01:28:44,552 --> 01:28:47,419
An enemy, an enemy...

420
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:58,597
A parting... He who makes a parting

421
01:29:00,968 --> 01:29:05,598
We are enemies...

422
01:29:08,943 --> 01:29:18,750
Others ask me to go. My love holds me fast

423
01:29:19,954 --> 01:29:22,718
When I see you, I don't like it

424
01:29:23,591 --> 01:29:26,992
When I don't see you, I hate it.

425
01:29:27,862 --> 01:29:31,093
I shouldn't have had...

426
01:29:31,332 --> 01:29:38,204
I didn't know you...

427
01:29:38,539 --> 01:29:44,967
Now that I think about it, I want to know...

428
01:29:45,513 --> 01:29:50,644
A sigh at the end of my thoughts

429
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:57,814
Night and day, my troubles are endless

430
01:29:58,192 --> 01:30:05,155
I'd rather...

431
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:12,099
You die first and I'll take you...

432
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:23,244
When I see you, I don't like it.

433
01:31:16,504 --> 01:31:17,937
No, no

434
01:31:17,972 --> 01:31:23,842
(When I don't see you, I hate it.

435
01:31:24,178 --> 01:31:28,012
I shouldn't have had...

436
01:31:28,316 --> 01:31:33,117
I...

437
01:32:36,017 --> 01:32:37,746
Why

438
01:32:42,023 --> 01:32:44,617
I never stopped loving

439
01:32:47,628 --> 01:32:49,255
you even for a moment.

440
01:32:51,866 --> 01:32:53,834
So why did you

441
01:32:56,904 --> 01:32:58,064
Love

442
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:03,270
You... took me when I was in high school.

443
01:33:03,311 --> 01:33:05,211
A girl lost her father

444
01:33:07,014 --> 01:33:09,778
And you forced her legs apart.

445
01:33:10,318 --> 01:33:12,513
Is that what you call love

446
01:33:17,658 --> 01:33:20,183
Then you never loved me

447
01:33:21,996 --> 01:33:24,055
Not even for a moment

448
01:35:26,954 --> 01:35:30,788
In the end, it all ended like

449
01:35:30,825 --> 01:35:32,725
that because of my jealousy.

450
01:35:36,297 --> 01:35:39,266
I didn't know something so big would happen

451
01:35:40,935 --> 01:35:43,096
I really didn't know

452
01:35:46,107 --> 01:35:50,100
Then what about Jin-woo's mother

453
01:38:51,659 --> 01:38:56,096
Jin-woo, stand there. Jin-woo... Look here...

454
01:38:56,130 --> 01:39:02,160
To comfort Young-mi, I even took you in

455
01:39:02,603 --> 01:39:05,299
like she wanted but it was no use.

456
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:08,671
Without Young-mi,

457
01:39:12,413 --> 01:39:19,819
I didn't have the guts to raise you all alone.

458
01:39:28,762 --> 01:39:31,322
But now... to see you all grown-up

459
01:39:32,566 --> 01:39:35,228
It makes me feel better.

460
01:39:42,309 --> 01:39:46,746
Um, I have something for you

461
01:39:58,492 --> 01:40:03,452
This is all that your mom left you

462
01:40:31,525 --> 01:40:37,088
Will you forgive me, Jin-woo

463
01:40:37,731 --> 01:40:44,762
You will, won't you? Jin-woo...

464
01:40:45,639 --> 01:40:48,369
Jin-woo...
