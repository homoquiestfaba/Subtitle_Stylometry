1
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:08,407
April 1, 1973 was the most bizarre
and most alien event ...

2
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:11,007
in the history of modern Brooklyn.

3
00:00:11,107 --> 00:00:13,382
Twelve people, who allegedly ...

4
00:00:13,483 --> 00:00:15,757
tenants were brothels and illegal
abortion clinics, were killed.

5
00:00:15,858 --> 00:00:18,007
Only one person preivela horrors.

6
00:00:18,107 --> 00:00:19,544
When the police finding a girlfriend,

7
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:22,082
she apologized such a
Fantastic and the side story,

8
00:00:22,183 --> 00:00:24,157
that they believed her to be poremeena.

9
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:26,007
Authorities immediately lock
in a mental institution.

10
00:00:26,107 --> 00:00:28,457
The most brilliant detectives
spent years working on it

11
00:00:28,558 --> 00:00:31,007
said that this side of the mystery ... but everything
to have undergone an dananjeg day fiasco.

12
00:00:31,107 --> 00:00:34,457
Fashion is Devojkin story, which
is believed to be crazy, true?

13
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,007
The filmmakers believe that this is so.

14
00:04:51,386 --> 00:04:55,508
Is everything ready?

15
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:00,781
Everything is ready!

16
00:07:11,327 --> 00:07:14,375
As long as normal sleep,
following up their nightmares?

17
00:07:14,495 --> 00:07:17,027
In the best case, a maximum of two hours.

18
00:07:17,308 --> 00:07:20,497
How is it possible that one so young
girl suffering from a rare disease so?

19
00:07:21,082 --> 00:07:24,776
Frank is not talking to you about it?
No, I am now arrived.

20
00:07:25,316 --> 00:07:27,388
Yes, I understand.

21
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:31,721
Have you heard something about the massacre
that happened a week ago?

22
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:35,308
I'm not reading anything about it,
but I heard the details of the news.

23
00:07:35,586 --> 00:07:37,885
You know, as an intern, I am very busy.

24
00:07:38,288 --> 00:07:41,989
Well, that girl was the only
a person who is to preivela.

25
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:44,061
Are you serious?
-Yes.

26
00:07:44,414 --> 00:07:45,993
What happened there, damn it?

27
00:07:46,271 --> 00:07:49,985
I only know that it is
Report of police.

28
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:53,136
But this is true,
knows that I do not know.

29
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,129
This is a stupid idea.

30
00:08:03,521 --> 00:08:04,721
Trust me.

31
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,310
Maybe it will change your mind.

32
00:08:58,346 --> 00:09:00,620
I do not understand why hoe to do this.

33
00:09:00,948 --> 00:09:04,843
I've already told you, nobody neu
say that you are the father.

34
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:08,897
A usual, immediately give for adoption.

35
00:09:09,017 --> 00:09:13,091
But this would be much easier.
Let me explain, bie fine.

36
00:09:13,943 --> 00:09:17,896
Radio to this hou.
These are not correct.

37
00:09:18,654 --> 00:09:21,029
But otherwise, this place is illegal.

38
00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:23,631
Speaking here,
let's go inside.

39
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:27,397
Well, then ringing.

00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,527

You're still young, but you

293
00:38:30,211 --> 00:38:31,428
Caught him.

294
00:38:31,973 --> 00:38:33,634

There must be a tool in the house,
for example, checks, or rafciger. Not that.

304
00:40:00,927 --> 00:40:03,042
I believe we can get through
do that thing over the wall.

305
00:40:03,062 --> 00:40:07,170
Right, we need a sledgehammer.
With that, we can easily break through the wall.

306
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,556
What a brilliant idea, guys!
What clever plan!

307

Therefore, you should get out of here
to get through.

00:41:34,811 --> 00:41:36,836
With these tools will take
some time,

333

350
00:42:56,978 --> 00:42:59,757
The two of us we'll stop this thing
before it starts to attack us.

351
00:43:00,028 --> 00:43:02,275
And do not do anything stupid.

352
00:43:04,727 --> 00:43:07,412
Both times he was killed,
moving through the pipes.

353
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:10,871
When we close the tube,
UPAE into a trap.

354
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:15,441
Sounds like a good plan. Fashion should
worked. Let's start one knows.

355
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,014
Case!

356
00:43:50,257 --> 00:43:51,590
He stopped!

357
00:43:52,516 --> 00:43:53,774
I do not know that this can not mean.

358
00:43:55,308 --> 00:43:56,565
Yes.

359
00:43:59,287 --> 00:44:00,853
Is there still a place where
could exits?

360
00:44:01,371 --> 00:44:02,786
This was the last one.

361
00:44:45,723 --> 00:44:47,092
Are you OK?

362
00:44:48,211 --> 00:44:51,003
Let's not mention the others.
Iovako known enough to care.

363
00:44:51,723 --> 00:44:53,289
Yes, let us know here.

364
00:44:53,417 --> 00:44:54,708
Yes.

365
00:45:12,267 --> 00:45:15,172
Many of the lake svriti the condom, do not you?

366
00:45:16,086 --> 00:45:20,082
Shut up, bitch! With this
neu achieve nothing.

367
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:22,931
When will you, whore, take the net?

368
00:45:27,639 --> 00:45:30,973
Here you go, love you!

369
00:45:43,802 --> 00:45:44,911
Give it to me.

370
00:45:45,027 --> 00:45:46,671
Not a problem, radio.

371
00:45:46,985 --> 00:45:48,368
Give it to me.

372
00:45:49,486 --> 00:45:52,947
Now it's her turn to work.
That's why only me?

373
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:26,212
Will you shut up already for some
Vetic the mouth?

374
00:46:39,498 --> 00:46:42,151
We did a lot of progress.
-Yes I know.

375
00:46:43,325 --> 00:46:45,890
Sluajte ... I have an idea
that could be hoped.

376
00:46:46,862 --> 00:46:48,315
With this guy we will not flourish anywhere.

377
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:49,825
Kai knows!

378
00:46:49,995 --> 00:46:52,511
There must weights in the house.

379
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:56,199
Aksel has a couple of pieces in
the basement, right? -Yes.

380
00:46:57,437 --> 00:46:59,736
Fashion should build
battering ram.

381
00:47:00,292 --> 00:47:01,551
What do you think?

382
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:04,963
We could take a strong uad
and attach it to the ceiling,

383
00:47:05,064 --> 00:47:07,848
they'd put a lot of weights on it
After just pushed.

384
00:47:10,981 --> 00:47:12,265
It's worth a try.

385
00:47:43,074 --> 00:47:44,813
Do you think that will work?
-I hope.

386
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:51,041
Do not make a big deal because
about earlier, I did not think so.

387
00:47:51,142 --> 00:47:54,084
The situation has sparked here
voltage from me.

388
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,732
Yes, you're probably right.

389
00:48:11,384 --> 00:48:12,746
Yes?

390
00:48:14,114 --> 00:48:18,597
Case, I have about $ 100 in my pocket.
There's no one up there ...

391
00:48:24,369 --> 00:48:26,991
Case, this mode when a boil, vai?

392
00:48:28,026 --> 00:48:30,169
Whether? Well, forget it!

393
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:33,312
Nee none of you see my money.

394
00:48:33,413 --> 00:48:36,399
You're both cheap hookers!

395
00:49:01,349 --> 00:49:04,620
Well, it seems to us your e
the idea out of here.

396
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:06,044
I hope.

397
00:49:06,149 --> 00:49:10,019
Drag it just as much as we can, and when
vie vui we can not, let him.

398
00:49:10,499 --> 00:49:11,855
Let's do it!

399
00:49:54,206 --> 00:49:58,349
Look, it's good to see
How do you cooperate.

400
00:49:58,981 --> 00:50:00,699
Aksel, put that weapon!

401
00:50:02,858 --> 00:50:07,292
So far the screw with me,
but I will not pay.

402
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,077
He thinks this will work?

403
00:50:15,591 --> 00:50:17,383
What a brilliant idea!

404
00:50:23,426 --> 00:50:25,048
Give me that weapon, Aksel!

405
00:50:25,149 --> 00:50:27,670
If you fuck around, took us
us vie to get them out of here.

406
00:50:29,262 --> 00:50:30,788
I think it will not work!

407
00:50:35,375 --> 00:50:39,429
Come on, hit me,
I know you're a tough guy.

408
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,206
Come on, tough guy,
hit me!

409
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:47,982
I'm here in front of you.

410
00:50:48,477 --> 00:50:51,888
Nee to return to jail, right?
Do not be stupid, Aksel.

411
00:50:55,976 --> 00:50:58,073
Come on, erman,
do not be stupid!

412
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:00,170
Give me that weapon, boy!

413
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:02,721
Neu let this bastard
fuck with me!

414
00:51:04,716 --> 00:51:06,042
This fucking bastard ...

415
00:51:31,818 --> 00:51:34,645
Now get up, damn you!

416
00:51:43,931 --> 00:51:46,888
If they depended on you,
would all die here.

417
00:51:48,037 --> 00:51:49,719
I was too soft on you ...

418
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:51,602
I threw you out of here
to rot outside!

419
00:51:51,603 --> 00:51:53,368
They would kill us everyone.

420
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:56,311
It would be much easier
you're not among us!

421
00:51:57,502 --> 00:51:58,839
Do not kill him!

422
00:51:59,346 --> 00:52:00,684
Iv Hou that behind em out of here!

423
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,146
I shot him.

424
00:52:39,858 --> 00:52:42,435
I shot him.
I know I did.

425
00:52:42,965 --> 00:52:45,189
To know this is not interested
when you hit.

426
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:52,563
Jo is one of the great stories.

427
00:52:55,405 --> 00:52:57,300
Most guys like you,
too much talking about.

428
00:52:58,749 --> 00:53:01,679
Now it's time to shut up.

429
00:53:03,965 --> 00:53:05,296
Vai?

430
00:53:13,885 --> 00:53:18,053
All you see that thing.
Much like a man!

431
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:25,606
You did not let me kill him earlier,
and now, bastard is porous!

432
00:53:29,016 --> 00:53:34,811
Ubiu that matter,
before it becomes larger.

433
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:42,775
Shit!

434
00:53:44,879 --> 00:53:47,077
You just how razmiljate
to exit from here,

435
00:53:47,178 --> 00:53:49,476
but if you like razmiljate,
We ate it all!

436
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:58,300
I do not know who previously led the
nesrenu gang ...

437
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:02,139
but now I ef.

438
00:54:04,275 --> 00:54:06,398
I'm the one who will to listen.

439
00:54:08,103 --> 00:54:10,503
Now you're really frightened.

440
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,700
End Kendi,
This is completely crazy.

441
00:54:25,786 --> 00:54:27,049
I frightened you, Candy?

442
00:54:38,502 --> 00:54:42,355
You idiot!
How could you?

443
00:54:42,475 --> 00:54:43,681
Shut up already!
Shut up!

444
00:54:51,985 --> 00:54:53,507
UUTI, it was of no use to us.

445
00:54:53,642 --> 00:54:54,462
Shut up!

446
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,354
Shut up, because they will kill you!

447
00:55:04,931 --> 00:55:06,356
If you had not seen a whisper.

448
00:55:08,667 --> 00:55:14,646
First learning,
manu e like it.

449
00:55:16,036 --> 00:55:20,710
He caught that thing,
and all of you help me!

450
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:23,667
If the killing of the creature that price

451
00:55:23,768 --> 00:55:26,849
after we get out of here, then kill him.
Hou only behind em iv.

452
00:55:27,887 --> 00:55:32,105
Exit e,
as soon kill him.

453
00:55:33,773 --> 00:55:38,379
What is this thing?
I have no idea.

454
00:55:40,885 --> 00:55:46,519
Or more precisely on the animal, each
animal has its hidden.

455
00:55:48,167 --> 00:55:51,186
If we found this place,
Then we got him!

456
00:55:51,552 --> 00:55:52,841
And how will this be carried out?

457
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:56,858
I was born for this.

458
00:55:57,946 --> 00:56:01,471
We know that it likes moist places,
so use pipes.

459
00:56:02,254 --> 00:56:04,767
And every animal in need of heat.

460
00:56:05,538 --> 00:56:06,960
Boiler room?

461
00:56:10,064 --> 00:56:11,387
I hope.

462
00:56:13,121 --> 00:56:16,127
You, you and Vanesa,
ite after me.

463
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:20,282
Fashion should remain one
mukarac order to protecting the ladies. I will remain.

464
00:56:21,184 --> 00:56:22,535
What courage.

465
00:56:25,302 --> 00:56:27,954
Do not worry, you will not be nothing.

466
00:56:29,032 --> 00:56:30,837
I thought only the girls.

467
00:56:31,154 --> 00:56:32,543
Yes, of course.

468
00:56:33,276 --> 00:56:34,691
Bitch ...
Shut up!

469
00:56:38,165 --> 00:56:40,236
I'm glad to have
one such hero.

470
00:56:40,356 --> 00:56:42,566
Get up, Kreem!

471
00:56:45,674 --> 00:56:48,845
Please do not ii, Aksel.
Be careful!

472
00:56:50,911 --> 00:56:52,376
I'm always careful.

473
00:57:18,278 --> 00:57:19,602
Go forward.

474
00:57:32,755 --> 00:57:34,486
Neu any tricks.

475
00:57:37,164 --> 00:57:39,197
Now before and on the other side.

476
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,150
Come on!

477
00:57:43,567 --> 00:57:45,778
Get your hands off me!
Shut up!

478
00:57:47,483 --> 00:57:48,771
You go first, Vanessa!

479
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:53,647
He knows how these guys are nervous.

480
00:58:13,495 --> 00:58:15,264
God, it seems to me too nervous.

481
00:58:39,702 --> 00:58:41,710
Activate the bulb!
Come on!

482
00:58:59,627 --> 00:59:00,789
Come on, move!

483
00:59:00,909 --> 00:59:03,682
Wait.
Look at this.

484
00:59:03,802 --> 00:59:05,551
What is it?
-I do not know.

485
00:59:11,083 --> 00:59:14,620
It looks like a tissue.
As an umbilical cord.

486
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:16,185
How do you know?

487
00:59:16,603 --> 00:59:19,702
as biology. I saw
Thus the net in the laboratory.

488
00:59:21,218 --> 00:59:23,188
It's stupid that we're down here.
Shut up!

489
00:59:26,826 --> 00:59:28,114
This is part of that creation.

490
00:59:29,964 --> 00:59:33,437
I hit it certainly was injured.

491
00:59:37,492 --> 00:59:38,767
I do not believe.

492
00:59:41,329 --> 00:59:43,438
I do not care your means.

493
00:59:56,737 --> 00:59:58,021
Is near.

494
01:00:07,867 --> 01:00:09,340
Very close.

495
01:00:22,812 --> 01:00:24,199
Krei, Vanesa.

496
01:00:55,441 --> 01:00:57,019
Fucking bullets

497
01:01:34,621 --> 01:01:35,843
The movement, up!

498
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,128
Was not it enough?
-Not!

499
01:01:47,742 --> 01:01:49,599
Please, at least I do not
I stay up here.

500
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:52,012
Come with us!

501
01:01:52,984 --> 01:01:54,915
I do not vraam there, man.

502
01:01:56,896 --> 01:01:59,750
Ii e wherever you say to go!

503
01:02:00,053 --> 01:02:01,468
I'm staying here.

504
01:02:03,211 --> 01:02:05,042
Do not you oppose!

505
01:02:05,343 --> 01:02:06,555
This is not fear!

506
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:06,879
Shut up!

507
01:02:07,146 --> 01:02:08,063
Please!

508
01:02:08,117 --> 01:02:10,326
Shut up already.

509
01:02:15,853 --> 01:02:17,068
And now...

510
01:02:17,159 --> 01:02:19,000
These will be my bait ...

511
01:02:21,984 --> 01:02:23,358
for my catch.

512
01:02:24,271 --> 01:02:26,177
You had your chance to stay alive.

513
01:02:27,306 --> 01:02:30,578
But no, you never learns ...

514
01:02:33,811 --> 01:02:35,172
Dimitro ...

515
01:02:36,742 --> 01:02:38,710
covered the li only one dialect of ...

516
01:02:40,364 --> 01:02:42,799
and blew your fucking brains out!

517
01:02:55,756 --> 01:02:57,133
Good home.

518
01:02:59,796 --> 01:03:04,963
To do that I tell you. Bark!

519
01:03:13,014 --> 01:03:14,289
Thrashing!

520
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:27,610
Thrashing, dog!

521
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:00,418
Good dog.

522
01:04:15,061 --> 01:04:16,966
This is what you do well.

523
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,528
Thrashing, dog!

524
01:05:15,858 --> 01:05:19,609
Die, motherfucker!

525
01:06:17,919 --> 01:06:19,522
Well, are you okay?

526
01:06:19,965 --> 01:06:21,263
You were dreaming.

527
01:06:23,906 --> 01:06:27,215
How long have I slept?
-Short time.

528
01:06:27,442 --> 01:06:29,085
Vanesa and Aksel died.

529
01:06:29,443 --> 01:06:31,488
Oh, God.

530
01:06:33,535 --> 01:06:38,252
Come on, start knows this now
is not the time for oseajnost.

531
01:06:38,985 --> 01:06:41,544
I do not know anything about this girl,
but that guy was a maniac.

532
01:06:41,645 --> 01:06:44,303
It is better for us that it is not among us.

533
01:06:44,846 --> 01:06:46,953
Tripping slightly on
the impact ram.

534
01:06:47,178 --> 01:06:50,903
So just decided.
I hope to work.

535
01:06:51,038 --> 01:06:53,390
Mora to operate. Must!

536
01:07:30,194 --> 01:07:32,253
Come on, let's pull it back
just as much as we can.

537
01:07:32,872 --> 01:07:34,489
I know that I have to do.

538
01:07:35,221 --> 01:07:36,533
Let's go then.

539
01:08:02,679 --> 01:08:04,989
We have not achieved anything!

540
01:08:05,698 --> 01:08:09,601
Come again!
As long as you do not break.

541
01:08:10,566 --> 01:08:13,118
Come on, we pokuavati!

542
01:08:14,867 --> 01:08:17,002
Okay.

543
01:08:26,197 --> 01:08:31,306
Do not plait, girl. Big Mom
deliver us out of this situation.

544
01:08:32,193 --> 01:08:37,018
I do not believe.
Osui my throat.

545
01:08:37,473 --> 01:08:39,406
He must have drunk a net cold.

546
01:08:45,151 --> 01:08:47,829
How can one person to work
this kind of work?

547
01:08:48,258 --> 01:08:50,759
Now I have no desire to talk about it.

548
01:08:51,189 --> 01:08:53,020
Okay.

549
01:08:59,356 --> 01:09:00,858
Have you heard?

550
01:09:02,353 --> 01:09:04,071
It's coming again!

551
01:09:04,336 --> 01:09:05,587
From where?

552
01:09:14,219 --> 01:09:15,603
Behind these doors.

553
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:29,161
Kill him!

554
01:09:29,809 --> 01:09:31,475
Kill him, you idiot!

555
01:09:56,709 --> 01:10:00,941
Vanesa ...
she was there!

556
01:10:02,596 --> 01:10:05,501
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault!

557
01:10:05,773 --> 01:10:09,373
You could not know.
We all thought that this creature!

558
01:10:13,238 --> 01:10:14,501
Behind these doors.

559
01:10:17,057 --> 01:10:17,764
Kill him!

560
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:19,811
Kill him, you idiot!

561
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:22,384
Behind these doors.

562
01:10:24,189 --> 01:10:27,674
Kill him, you idiot!
Kill him!

563
01:10:28,002 --> 01:10:29,654
Kill him, you idiot!

564
01:10:35,002 --> 01:10:37,937
Vanesa ...

565
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,168
I need your help.

566
01:10:52,547 --> 01:10:55,301
Forget it!
It's not worth anything.

567
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:57,158
So what do we do then?

568
01:10:58,029 --> 01:11:00,750
We have to call someone to help us.

569
01:11:01,394 --> 01:11:04,059
There must be someone out there
God knows we're in trouble.

570
01:11:04,729 --> 01:11:07,622
Here we are already more than one day.
Briefly.

571
01:11:08,877 --> 01:11:12,389
We like to to hoe.
I'm tired of the stress.

572
01:11:13,387 --> 01:11:15,484
I try to make em some help.

573
01:11:17,353 --> 01:11:20,208
The police may not do e every time.
They must have reported the case!

574
01:11:26,698 --> 01:11:28,972
Come on, let's continue.

575
01:11:40,386 --> 01:11:41,800
Do not moe that uutka?

576
01:11:42,369 --> 01:11:44,757
Everyone has their own way out
to overcome the trouble.

577
01:11:44,858 --> 01:11:47,346
I can not tell her that
its incorrect.

578
01:11:48,218 --> 01:11:49,822
Christ!

579
01:12:27,249 --> 01:12:28,714
What is this thing?

580
01:12:29,333 --> 01:12:30,556
I do not know.

581
01:12:34,386 --> 01:12:35,697
This is a way out!

582
01:12:41,826 --> 01:12:43,416
Come on, help me know!

583
01:12:48,519 --> 01:12:49,957
What is this hell?

584
01:12:54,645 --> 01:12:55,988
The path leads upwards.

585
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:02,297
I think I see the sky.
-Get Out of my way!

586
01:13:04,381 --> 01:13:05,493
This is a way out!

587
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:07,719
But we can not see what is out there.

588
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:09,171
I do not know...

589
01:13:09,324 --> 01:13:11,231
Rupa is quite narrow.

590
01:13:12,103 --> 01:13:13,783
Fashion should I go first.

591
01:13:14,301 --> 01:13:16,233
Forget it, I'm going!

592
01:13:16,607 --> 01:13:21,028
Wait a minute, let her go first!
There is less. I moe going in there after assistance.

593
01:13:21,255 --> 01:13:24,325
Get out of my way!
She left us here to die!

594
01:13:24,628 --> 01:13:26,927
Let him go, no purpose
We hold with him.

595
01:15:41,466 --> 01:15:43,575
Boe, this was a trap.

596
01:15:45,474 --> 01:15:46,964
We have no chance.

597
01:16:04,121 --> 01:16:05,757
Do not do it!

598
01:16:48,404 --> 01:16:52,232
Where are you going? -Hou To see
Aksel before to die.

599
01:16:52,737 --> 01:16:55,781
I picked it up, he
the only child I have.

600
01:16:56,342 --> 01:16:57,719
I should be with him.

601
01:16:59,588 --> 01:17:00,949
He's dead!

602
01:17:02,430 --> 01:17:05,652
Does not matter.
Do ii!

603
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:08,094
Kai her to stay!

604
01:17:08,485 --> 01:17:10,430
I can see her nothing better predloiti.

605
01:18:53,812 --> 01:18:59,496
Still, I'm sure. I neu ii
to check, they would just kill themselves.

606
01:19:01,707 --> 01:19:03,059
I do not know that it would be able to do.

607
01:19:03,268 --> 01:19:04,555
He's coming!

608
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:06,042
this?

609
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:34,877
How is this possible?

610
01:19:37,392 --> 01:19:38,814
I know.

611
01:19:39,356 --> 01:19:44,030
Let him catch me after u
kill him! Only I can not promaiti.

612
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:46,542
Ubiu it, for sure!

613
01:19:50,985 --> 01:19:52,879
Where are you?!

614
01:19:56,201 --> 01:20:00,193
Behind i! He sent you back to hell!

615
01:23:13,745 --> 01:23:15,896
Jesus Christ!

616
01:23:22,937 --> 01:23:24,348
Are you all right, Mr. Ice?

617
01:23:27,043 --> 01:23:28,684
Do not worry, bie fine.

618
01:23:37,518 --> 01:23:39,016
I do not know what to say to you,

619
01:23:39,117 --> 01:23:40,714
but this is a matter najèudnija
I've ever heard.

620
01:23:41,456 --> 01:23:43,047
Of course, do not trust her.

621
01:23:43,566 --> 01:23:45,967
Have you already tried that
use detector lai?

622
01:23:46,068 --> 01:23:47,918
Three times already proletarian tested.

623
01:23:48,019 --> 01:23:50,968
Some people do not know to discern
illusion from reality.

624
01:23:51,457 --> 01:23:55,221
Because if you believe in the net, then it
becomes their reality.

625
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,267
And so the tests become positive ...
-Of course.

626
01:23:59,468 --> 01:24:01,199
Since you are working on this case, Doctor?

627
01:24:01,736 --> 01:24:04,389
At the clinic of the spring Sunday.

628
01:24:14,583 --> 01:24:16,010
Ups.

629
01:24:16,553 --> 01:24:22,048
The girl named Rebekah
passed in June lap.

630
01:24:28,079 --> 01:24:29,885

632
01:24:37,514 --> 01:24:38,873

Shut up, man!
