1
00:01:30,805 --> 00:01:34,673
Oh, man, that's too much
energy to get back up.

2
00:01:41,273 --> 00:01:43,562
Oh, boy, gosh.

3
00:01:57,496 --> 00:01:59,573
Okay...

4
00:02:13,177 --> 00:02:15,669
I hate Mondays.

5
00:02:22,812 --> 00:02:23,890
Hot, hot, hot.

6
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,034
Good morning, Odie.

7
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,167
Are you hungry, boy?

8
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,872
Attaboy.

9
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,794
Well, breakfast is nearly ready.

10
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,342
We'll eat as soon
as I roust Mr. Grumpy.

11
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,052
Garfield. Breakfast.

12
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,470
Well, what do you know?

13
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:09,722
I guess every cloud
does have a silver lining.

14
00:03:15,527 --> 00:03:16,606
Oh, no.

15
00:03:29,373 --> 00:03:31,282
Oh, my.

16
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,964
Good morning, Garfield.

17
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:46,466
Good morning?

18
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,548
Good morning?

19
00:03:48,724 --> 00:03:50,266
Jon. It's Monday.

20
00:03:50,434 --> 00:03:52,556
Monday is the armpit of the week.

21
00:03:53,103 --> 00:03:55,061
It's like a black hole
on the calendar...

22
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,184
...that just sucks all the joy
out of your entire being.

23
00:03:58,358 --> 00:03:59,473
Lighten up, Garfield.

24
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,773
You're the star of a comic strip.

25
00:04:02,904 --> 00:04:05,275
Work is a big part of the problem.

26
00:04:05,448 --> 00:04:07,441
Well, you'd better cheer up fast, pal...

27
00:04:07,616 --> 00:04:10,451
...because we leave for work
in 20 minutes.

28
00:04:18,376 --> 00:04:20,702
I could just cry.

29
00:04:42,106 --> 00:04:44,016
Good morning.

30
00:04:50,031 --> 00:04:51,940
Hey, stop.

31
00:04:53,491 --> 00:04:55,484
Hello there.

32
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,203
There they are.

33
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:09,417
- Morning, guys.
- Why don't you sit in the back, Odie?

34
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,713
Good morning, Garfield.

35
00:05:11,884 --> 00:05:13,212
Good morning, Arlene.

36
00:05:13,385 --> 00:05:15,592
Hey, why don't you sit up here
with me?

37
00:05:15,763 --> 00:05:17,174
Hey, Garfield.

38
00:05:17,347 --> 00:05:18,545
Get in the back, Nermal.

39
00:05:18,723 --> 00:05:20,965
L'll just sit in back.

40
00:05:22,686 --> 00:05:23,883
Buckle up, kids.

41
00:05:27,231 --> 00:05:30,315
It's gonna be a long drive.

42
00:05:32,236 --> 00:05:36,103
Hey, Garfield,
guess what day it is today.

43
00:05:36,281 --> 00:05:38,024
I know what day it is, Nermal.

44
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:39,776
Oh, come on, guess.

45
00:05:39,951 --> 00:05:43,570
- Nermal.
- I guess you don't know.

46
00:05:43,746 --> 00:05:45,027
It's Monday.

47
00:05:45,206 --> 00:05:46,914
It's what?

48
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,576
Monday.

49
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:51,372
And you hate Mondays

50
00:05:51,546 --> 00:05:53,454
M to the "ondays"

51
00:05:53,631 --> 00:05:56,085
You hate them
You hate them, yeah

52
00:05:56,258 --> 00:05:59,378
Not as much as I hate you, Nermal.

53
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:07,509
Hey, come on, we're gonna
be late for school.

54
00:06:18,571 --> 00:06:21,239
- Hey, Jack.
- Howdy.

55
00:06:31,665 --> 00:06:34,453
- Those three scenes are dumb there.
- I like them.

56
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,868
I'm so hungry, I could eat a horse.

57
00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:38,416
Good morning, Billy Bear.

58
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:42,047
Hey, that's my name.
Don't wear it out.

59
00:06:42,217 --> 00:06:47,377
- How are you, Randy Rabbit?
- Jon, I'm fantastic.

60
00:06:47,555 --> 00:06:50,260
Oh, man, here we go.

61
00:06:57,105 --> 00:07:01,981
Zelda, Zelda, Zelda,
how's my favorite catering wench today?

62
00:07:04,654 --> 00:07:06,481
What's your poison du jour?

63
00:07:06,656 --> 00:07:08,780
Cat creole.

64
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,575
Care for some?

65
00:07:11,619 --> 00:07:14,110
You ever thought
of just letting your hair down?

66
00:07:15,956 --> 00:07:19,788
L'll bet you'd be a heartbreaker,
baby cakes.

67
00:07:27,467 --> 00:07:29,792
Walter, please.

68
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,511
Sorry, dear.

69
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:34,383
Why must you always be fiddling
with things?

70
00:07:34,556 --> 00:07:38,305
I mean, why can't you just sit quietly
like a good husband?

71
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:40,469
Yes, dear.

72
00:07:43,523 --> 00:07:46,394
- Yo, Wally.
- Hey, Garfield.

73
00:07:46,568 --> 00:07:49,272
So, what's the world's greatest inventor
up to today?

74
00:07:49,446 --> 00:07:50,690
Watch.

75
00:07:57,953 --> 00:08:02,414
I thought I had another cookie.

76
00:08:04,835 --> 00:08:06,957
Hey, where can I get one
of those, Wally?

77
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:09,666
L'll put you on the list.

78
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:15,464
Contrary to popular belief,
nose blowing is an art.

79
00:08:15,636 --> 00:08:17,427
Let me demonstrate.

80
00:08:19,682 --> 00:08:21,389
The toot.

81
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:25,143
Not bad.

82
00:08:25,604 --> 00:08:29,471
Oh, man.
I gotta get out of this place.

83
00:08:30,317 --> 00:08:33,103
A whoopee cushion.

84
00:08:41,785 --> 00:08:43,825
I love when he does that.

85
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:51,791
- Thanks.
- Live it up, pal.

86
00:08:55,173 --> 00:08:58,588
And, my fave, the party blowout.

87
00:09:08,184 --> 00:09:09,975
There she blows.

88
00:09:14,191 --> 00:09:16,860
You are disgusting.

89
00:09:17,026 --> 00:09:19,184
Now you're getting it.

90
00:09:19,361 --> 00:09:21,983
Walter, let's go.

91
00:09:22,156 --> 00:09:24,232
Yes, dear.

92
00:09:30,831 --> 00:09:32,408
Look.

93
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,030
Rest my case.

94
00:09:35,418 --> 00:09:37,494
Here comes Betty.
Everybody act naturally.

95
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,379
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

96
00:09:42,258 --> 00:09:44,131
Good morning, everyone.

97
00:09:44,302 --> 00:09:46,045
- Hi, Betty.
- Morning.

98
00:09:51,516 --> 00:09:53,674
Oh, my heavens. Oh, Randy.

99
00:09:53,852 --> 00:09:56,557
Oh, my dear.
Oh, I didn't realize.

100
00:09:56,729 --> 00:10:00,098
Oh, sweetheart, I'm so, so sorry.

101
00:10:07,865 --> 00:10:10,153
You.

102
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:13,829
That was a good one, guys.

103
00:10:17,374 --> 00:10:19,780
Are you okay, Garfield?

104
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:23,828
You seem to be depressed.

105
00:10:24,005 --> 00:10:26,495
I prefer to think of it as pensive.

106
00:10:26,674 --> 00:10:31,251
Well, if pensive means being a butt,
then l'll go with that.

107
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:33,586
I'm just tired of doing the comic strip.

108
00:10:33,764 --> 00:10:36,219
Going through the same routine
every day.

109
00:10:36,391 --> 00:10:41,100
Hearing the same tired jokes
every day, every day.

110
00:10:41,271 --> 00:10:44,639
Oh, man. A change of scenery
would be wonderful.

111
00:10:44,815 --> 00:10:47,388
- I need a break.
- A break from me?

112
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:50,189
This isn't about you, Arlene.
It's about me.

113
00:10:50,362 --> 00:10:53,363
Did you ever notice
it's always about you?

114
00:10:56,492 --> 00:10:58,036
- A few more to go.
- Okay.

115
00:10:59,037 --> 00:11:02,072
Hey, I meant to you give this.

116
00:11:02,248 --> 00:11:07,243
Why, Garfield, how sweet.

117
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:11,583
Oh, and here I am being all paranoid.

118
00:11:11,756 --> 00:11:14,294
Paranoia's good.
It's, you know, it's good to...

119
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:16,674
Nobody should take a relationship
for granted.

120
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:18,754
Monday roughs.

121
00:11:19,347 --> 00:11:22,347
How about that, time to go to work.

122
00:11:25,812 --> 00:11:27,519
Here you go, Betty.

123
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:30,392
- Oh, thank you.
- Any time.

124
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:32,604
The scripts are here, people.

125
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:35,943
We have a comics page to get out.

126
00:11:56,422 --> 00:11:59,792
Tempus fugit, people.

127
00:12:01,302 --> 00:12:04,885
Today I need Garfield and Odie.

128
00:12:05,056 --> 00:12:07,593
Are you sure I'm not in the script?

129
00:12:07,767 --> 00:12:10,933
Did I ask for Nermal to step forward?

130
00:12:11,103 --> 00:12:15,314
Keith, did the name Nermal
escape my lips?

131
00:12:15,482 --> 00:12:17,141
I don't think so.

132
00:12:17,318 --> 00:12:21,065
There you go. I don't think so.

133
00:12:27,035 --> 00:12:29,656
Oh, prop boy.

134
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:34,075
- Yes, you called, sir?
- The script calls for a bone.

135
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:38,039
A bone, let's see.

136
00:12:39,254 --> 00:12:42,289
L'll be back in one second.

137
00:12:45,719 --> 00:12:47,877
Hey, don't get too attached
to that bone, dog.

138
00:12:48,053 --> 00:12:51,303
It's the official property
of the Prop Department.

139
00:12:53,017 --> 00:12:56,017
Can Jon do my lines today?

140
00:12:57,229 --> 00:12:58,639
I need a nap.

141
00:12:58,813 --> 00:13:02,017
How about, the sooner you do
what I tell you to do...

142
00:13:02,192 --> 00:13:04,232
...the sooner you get to take a nap?

143
00:13:04,694 --> 00:13:07,480
Why do I put up with this?

144
00:13:07,655 --> 00:13:10,822
All right, let's shoot, people.

145
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:14,574
Eli. Bring up the park set.

146
00:13:14,745 --> 00:13:16,452
You got it.

147
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,882
Are we ready to shoot?

148
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:36,882
Where is Garfield?

149
00:13:37,057 --> 00:13:40,343
Garfield. Get over here.

150
00:13:42,562 --> 00:13:45,598
I really need a break.

151
00:13:47,775 --> 00:13:50,396
Places, people.

152
00:13:51,988 --> 00:13:53,612
Action.

153
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:58,111
Odie and I
enjoy each other's company.

154
00:13:58,285 --> 00:13:59,744
Take it.

155
00:14:01,371 --> 00:14:05,321
- Bring up the roller coaster set.
- Coming up.

156
00:14:09,462 --> 00:14:11,169
Action.

157
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:17,882
Whether it's going
to an amusement park:

158
00:14:18,053 --> 00:14:19,547
Take it.

159
00:14:21,807 --> 00:14:25,341
- Bring up the kitchen set.
- Yes, sir.

160
00:14:29,522 --> 00:14:31,182
Action.

161
00:14:31,858 --> 00:14:34,478
Or just getting together for kicks.

162
00:14:34,652 --> 00:14:36,146
Take it.

163
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:39,110
Perfect.

164
00:14:45,036 --> 00:14:46,993
That's a wrap on Garfield.

165
00:14:47,163 --> 00:14:50,781
Keep moving people,
we have two more strips to do.

166
00:14:59,716 --> 00:15:00,914
What's up, dog?

167
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:05,592
You're in love with the bone.

168
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,761
And you don't want the prop boy
to take the bone back.

169
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,681
What would a smart dog
do with that bone?

170
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:19,603
A smart dog would hide it
from the prop boy.

171
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,314
Good luck.

172
00:15:25,574 --> 00:15:27,945
Fishing is stupid, Billy.

173
00:15:28,118 --> 00:15:30,443
You won't say that come dinnertime,
Randy.

174
00:15:30,619 --> 00:15:32,578
Take it.

175
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:37,990
- Why? What are we having for dinner?
- Take it.

176
00:15:39,836 --> 00:15:42,458
- Pizza.
- We're fishing for pizza.

177
00:15:42,631 --> 00:15:45,086
Take it.

178
00:15:46,134 --> 00:15:50,215
Perfect. Let's get everything ready
for the Stegman's.

179
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,137
Was that good for you?
I really felt I was the shark that time.

180
00:15:58,312 --> 00:16:00,886
Yes, kid, you were marvelous,
absolutely marvelous.

181
00:16:01,065 --> 00:16:04,065
Keep it moving, people.

182
00:16:04,651 --> 00:16:05,979
Yeah.

183
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:42,135
Okay, dog, where's my prop bone?

184
00:16:43,312 --> 00:16:44,593
I don't know.

185
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:48,222
I am keeping an eye on you, dog.

186
00:16:54,239 --> 00:16:57,405
- Hey, Eli.
- Hey, Garfield.

187
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,905
Would you mind if I just slip under
your control station for a little nap?

188
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,951
- Help yourself.
- Thanks.

189
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:11,163
Maybe a nap
will put you in a better mood.

190
00:17:12,547 --> 00:17:14,919
I'm in a rut, Eli.

191
00:17:15,508 --> 00:17:17,050
I'm just tired of this job.

192
00:17:17,218 --> 00:17:22,722
I'm tired of doing the same thing
over and over, I need a change.

193
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,799
Garfield.

194
00:17:24,975 --> 00:17:27,015
Don't touch that.

195
00:17:29,104 --> 00:17:32,804
A lot of people
would kill to do what you do.

196
00:17:32,982 --> 00:17:35,225
You have adoring fans.

197
00:17:35,402 --> 00:17:37,478
You're a celebrity, man.

198
00:17:37,653 --> 00:17:40,405
Wow, it must be nice.

199
00:17:40,573 --> 00:17:41,901
What's nice?

200
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:45,194
Sitting around pushing buttons all day.

201
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:48,784
Why do I even talk to you?

202
00:17:48,956 --> 00:17:53,582
Hey, Bonita, why did
the existential chicken cross the road?

203
00:17:53,752 --> 00:17:54,914
Take it.

204
00:17:57,088 --> 00:18:01,666
An existential chicken
wouldn't have to cross the road...

205
00:18:01,843 --> 00:18:05,460
...if he didn't perceive a road, Walter.

206
00:18:05,638 --> 00:18:07,297
Take it.

207
00:18:08,682 --> 00:18:12,727
Now be a good boy
and take out the trash.

208
00:18:12,895 --> 00:18:16,559
I don't perceive any trash, Bonita.

209
00:18:16,731 --> 00:18:17,809
Take it.

210
00:18:19,692 --> 00:18:22,065
Perfect. That's a wrap, people.

211
00:18:22,236 --> 00:18:24,395
Put it to bed and print it, Betty.

212
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:27,821
Aye, aye, captain. Right away, sir.

213
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:51,092
Odie and I enjoy
each other's company.

214
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:57,678
Whether it's going
to an amusement park...

215
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:04,516
...or just getting together for kicks.

216
00:19:07,195 --> 00:19:09,067
Attention, Eli.

217
00:19:09,238 --> 00:19:11,645
Attention, Eli.

218
00:19:14,493 --> 00:19:17,066
The comic strips
are ready for transmission.

219
00:19:17,245 --> 00:19:22,749
I repeat, the comic strips
are ready for transmission.

220
00:19:24,918 --> 00:19:28,916
Betty, why do you use the intercom?

221
00:19:29,089 --> 00:19:34,925
Well, because it's kind of neat,
that's why, Eli.

222
00:19:36,554 --> 00:19:40,054
All right, let's get the screen ready.

223
00:20:05,332 --> 00:20:07,786
It's show time.

224
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:08,338
Smells good, sweetie.

225
00:21:08,515 --> 00:21:10,637
Kids, breakfast.

226
00:21:10,808 --> 00:21:12,966
And the funnies are here.

227
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:16,349
Yay!

228
00:21:18,649 --> 00:21:21,649
All right, let's see
what's going on in the comics.

229
00:21:28,867 --> 00:21:31,736
Let's watch someone read the comics.

230
00:21:34,705 --> 00:21:36,864
Billy Bear says, "Pizza."

231
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,532
"We're fishing for pizza?"

232
00:21:39,709 --> 00:21:42,081
And what does Billy Bear say?

233
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:49,299
You got it, Rusty.

234
00:21:49,468 --> 00:21:53,252
What a great kid.
He's one of my biggest fans.

235
00:21:53,431 --> 00:21:55,090
Give me a break.

236
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:58,434
Hey, Eli.
Show us some more newspapers.

237
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:00,642
Yeah. Change the channel.

238
00:22:00,812 --> 00:22:02,390
Here you go.

239
00:22:07,818 --> 00:22:09,361
Whoa, back it up.

240
00:22:11,822 --> 00:22:14,988
Eli, look over at the hot dogs
and zoom in.

241
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:16,618
You got it, Garfield.

242
00:22:27,462 --> 00:22:31,839
That is one of the most beautiful sights
I have ever seen.

243
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:40,007
Oh, hello, little hot dogs.

244
00:22:47,523 --> 00:22:51,305
Oh, yeah, that's beautiful.

245
00:22:51,484 --> 00:22:53,393
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

246
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,645
Come on over.

247
00:22:56,572 --> 00:22:58,529
Oh, boy.

248
00:23:01,994 --> 00:23:03,868
Yummy.

249
00:23:17,341 --> 00:23:19,714
The real world.

250
00:23:55,168 --> 00:23:57,837
Hey.

251
00:24:01,257 --> 00:24:03,628
Hey, wha...? What's going...?

252
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:06,333
Wait, wait, there must be something...

253
00:24:08,638 --> 00:24:10,880
Hey, that's my bone.

254
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:13,642
Great.

255
00:24:18,188 --> 00:24:19,848
Good gracious. What's going on?

256
00:24:22,985 --> 00:24:26,519
Step away from the patch
in the screen, Odie.

257
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:36,406
Everybody stay away
from the patch in the screen...

258
00:24:36,581 --> 00:24:41,207
...or you'll end up in the real world
with no way back, like Odie's bone.

259
00:24:45,422 --> 00:24:46,750
The real world.

260
00:24:46,923 --> 00:24:49,497
That's the change I need.

261
00:24:50,427 --> 00:24:52,051
Prop boy.

262
00:24:54,013 --> 00:24:55,756
Bring me the special tape.

263
00:24:55,932 --> 00:25:00,558
Okay, let's see.
Special tape, just a second.

264
00:25:05,482 --> 00:25:08,436
What's happening?
What's wrong?

265
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,935
You better come back.

266
00:25:11,696 --> 00:25:12,894
Garfield.

267
00:25:13,072 --> 00:25:14,104
Garfield.

268
00:25:14,281 --> 00:25:15,741
Garfield.

269
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:19,445
I'm in the real world.

270
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,905
Look, I'm a real cat.

271
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:26,496
This is the real deal.

272
00:25:28,128 --> 00:25:31,959
Oh, man, this is just the change
I needed.

273
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:34,457
Oh, yes.

274
00:25:36,677 --> 00:25:39,631
What is that smell?

275
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:41,597
Yeah.

276
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:51,806
Get out of here, you crazy cat.
Come on, get out of here.

277
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:56,028
I know you people in the real world
can't understand what I'm saying but...

278
00:25:57,988 --> 00:26:01,275
- I love you, man.
- Crazy cat.

279
00:26:04,453 --> 00:26:05,651
This is great.

280
00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:10,159
No more boring job at the comic,
no more slobbering dog to bug me.

281
00:26:10,334 --> 00:26:13,204
I'm free to do whatever I want.

282
00:26:13,378 --> 00:26:15,833
Here's to my new life.

283
00:26:22,428 --> 00:26:25,595
I don't believe it. My cat, gone.

284
00:26:25,765 --> 00:26:27,223
Eli, what just happened?

285
00:26:27,392 --> 00:26:29,099
All right.

286
00:26:30,811 --> 00:26:33,099
Everybody, listen up.

287
00:26:33,814 --> 00:26:39,056
This screen separates the comic world
from the real world.

288
00:26:39,527 --> 00:26:43,525
The comic world
is pressurized like an airplane.

289
00:26:44,782 --> 00:26:48,731
If you get sucked into the real world,
there's no way back.

290
00:26:48,911 --> 00:26:50,025
Special tape.

291
00:26:50,203 --> 00:26:51,663
Are there any questions?

292
00:26:59,879 --> 00:27:01,706
Get away from there.

293
00:27:03,215 --> 00:27:06,916
- Didn't you just hear what I said?
- Help.

294
00:27:07,677 --> 00:27:11,012
Everybody stay away from the patch.

295
00:27:11,181 --> 00:27:13,589
- Got it?
- You don't need to tell me twice.

296
00:27:14,893 --> 00:27:17,181
Give me that special tape.

297
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:23,230
I hope you've all learned your lesson.

298
00:27:23,401 --> 00:27:25,476
I think Garfield learned his lesson.

299
00:27:31,074 --> 00:27:34,443
Garfield's just getting started
on his lesson.

300
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:48,120
My bone. My bone.

301
00:27:51,677 --> 00:27:54,049
My bone.

302
00:27:56,848 --> 00:27:59,469
Odie? Oh, no, you don't.

303
00:27:59,643 --> 00:28:01,386
You're not gonna ruin
my new life.

304
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,554
You can go right back
where you came from.

305
00:28:05,898 --> 00:28:08,815
See you in the funny papers, Odie.

306
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:17,991
That didn't work.

307
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,781
There must be an easier way
of sending you back, Odie.

308
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:27,574
Where are you going, Arlene?

309
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:29,875
I'm going to join Garfield.

310
00:28:30,046 --> 00:28:32,999
Oh, no, you're not.
We have a strip to do, lady.

311
00:28:33,174 --> 00:28:34,288
Nermal's right.

312
00:28:34,466 --> 00:28:37,252
This is where we belong. Garfield too.

313
00:28:37,427 --> 00:28:39,669
He's just a little confused right now.

314
00:28:39,847 --> 00:28:43,630
And if you stay, Garfield will have
one more reason to find a way back.

315
00:28:49,188 --> 00:28:52,307
Oh, he'd better come back.

316
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:08,161
Well, Odie,
it looks like I'm stuck with you.

317
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:11,247
Let's find some real food to eat.

318
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,089
Eli, we lost them.

319
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:22,175
Don't worry,
it'll just take me a second to find them.

320
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:26,343
There we go.

321
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:32,638
Come on, Odie.

322
00:29:52,788 --> 00:29:55,457
We should have found
a buffet by now.

323
00:29:55,624 --> 00:29:58,246
This is the buffet, pal.

324
00:29:58,419 --> 00:30:00,577
Wh...? A talking trash can.

325
00:30:00,754 --> 00:30:03,245
I didn't know they had those
in the real world.

326
00:30:03,423 --> 00:30:05,915
I ain't no trash can, fella.

327
00:30:08,011 --> 00:30:10,133
You must not be
from this neighborhood.

328
00:30:10,305 --> 00:30:11,633
I'm not from this world.

329
00:30:11,805 --> 00:30:14,926
I'm Garfield the cat, you know,
from the comic strip?

330
00:30:15,768 --> 00:30:17,677
Right.

331
00:30:18,103 --> 00:30:20,594
And your dog friend there
must be Odie.

332
00:30:20,772 --> 00:30:22,646
Hey, Odie. A fan.

333
00:30:30,697 --> 00:30:32,738
Looks like Odie's
made some new friends.

334
00:30:32,909 --> 00:30:35,281
Well, I'm Shecky.

335
00:30:35,453 --> 00:30:37,077
Glad to meet you, Shecky.

336
00:30:37,246 --> 00:30:41,029
So when do they serve dinner
around here?

337
00:30:47,422 --> 00:30:50,423
How are we going to have
a funny comic strip without our star?

338
00:30:50,592 --> 00:30:52,584
We need a funny cat.

339
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,511
Hey, hey, hey. What am I?
Chopped liver?

340
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,472
First, we'll change the name
of the strip to Nermal.

341
00:31:01,977 --> 00:31:05,428
The hilarious adventures
of a wacky kitten.

342
00:31:06,105 --> 00:31:09,973
And his slow-witted
but well-meaning sidekick, Arlene.

343
00:31:10,694 --> 00:31:12,152
What do you say?

344
00:31:13,195 --> 00:31:15,947
Let me at him. L'll kill him.
I'm gonna kill him.

345
00:31:16,115 --> 00:31:19,318
Arlene, chill, babe.

346
00:31:19,493 --> 00:31:21,900
Just trying to help.

347
00:31:52,941 --> 00:31:55,396
Me and some buddies
are going to dinner and a show.

348
00:31:55,568 --> 00:31:59,102
- Wanna come?
- Yeah, sure.

349
00:32:03,992 --> 00:32:07,326
Just as soon as I help Odie
out of this situation.

350
00:32:07,828 --> 00:32:11,198
Hey, Odie. Throw me the bone.

351
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:41,982
There's more than one way
to skin a dog.

352
00:32:47,324 --> 00:32:50,159
Now, that's what I call
a calorie burner.

353
00:32:50,326 --> 00:32:51,489
Here you go, Odie.

354
00:32:53,496 --> 00:32:56,829
The real world is certainly more exciting
than the comic world.

355
00:32:57,458 --> 00:33:00,411
Sure, whatever.
Hey, the show begins soon.

356
00:33:00,586 --> 00:33:04,370
Sounds good. Lead on, Mr. Shecky.

357
00:33:12,472 --> 00:33:15,010
Here we are, gentlemen.

358
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,228
Hey, bloody twit.

359
00:33:26,735 --> 00:33:29,772
This is Waldo.
He's not as bright as he looks.

360
00:33:30,323 --> 00:33:31,567
Thank you.

361
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,408
And this is Sheila.

362
00:33:34,576 --> 00:33:36,651
Cheers, lads.

363
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:40,489
I'd want her covering my back
in any catfight.

364
00:33:41,374 --> 00:33:43,781
Guys, this is Garfield and Odie.

365
00:33:43,959 --> 00:33:48,004
You know, the comic strip characters?

366
00:33:48,172 --> 00:33:49,963
Wink, wink.

367
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:52,831
I love you, guys.

368
00:33:53,009 --> 00:33:55,250
I read you all the time.

369
00:33:55,429 --> 00:33:58,215
Just mostly, I look at the pictures,
you know.

370
00:33:58,389 --> 00:34:00,762
Why, thank you.

371
00:34:01,392 --> 00:34:03,218
Hello, hello.

372
00:34:03,394 --> 00:34:05,849
You're kind of cute, darling.

373
00:34:07,731 --> 00:34:11,479
What? You want cute, lady?
L'll give you cute.

374
00:34:21,035 --> 00:34:22,779
Welcome to Club Shecky.

375
00:34:22,954 --> 00:34:25,409
This is where we come
for dinner and a show.

376
00:34:25,581 --> 00:34:28,249
We put on a show
and people throw dinner at us.

377
00:34:28,417 --> 00:34:30,076
This I gotta see.

378
00:34:30,252 --> 00:34:33,336
Allow me to demonstrate.

379
00:34:39,761 --> 00:34:41,967
Okay, Waldo, this course is yours.

380
00:34:45,015 --> 00:34:46,806
Goody, goody.

381
00:34:49,729 --> 00:34:52,895
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

382
00:34:53,064 --> 00:34:56,813
Our first performer this evening
is none other than the man himself.

383
00:34:56,984 --> 00:34:58,313
For crying out loud.

384
00:34:58,487 --> 00:35:02,270
Please welcome Shecky.

385
00:35:02,448 --> 00:35:06,363
Thank you. Thank you. Hey,
it's great to be back at Club Shecky.

386
00:35:06,536 --> 00:35:09,287
A funny thing happened
on the way to the fence tonight...

387
00:35:09,455 --> 00:35:11,364
...I was run over by a milk truck.

388
00:35:11,539 --> 00:35:15,917
That's the first time
the drinks were ever on me.

389
00:35:16,419 --> 00:35:17,795
Go on.

390
00:35:17,963 --> 00:35:20,121
Thank you. Thank you.
For my first number...

391
00:35:20,298 --> 00:35:24,592
Hey. Be quiet.
We're trying to sleep up here.

392
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,429
- I'd like to sing something
from my latest album.

393
00:35:27,596 --> 00:35:29,838
Shut up, you stupid cat.

394
00:35:30,015 --> 00:35:32,851
Get ready, here comes dinner.

395
00:35:33,019 --> 00:35:35,888
It goes something like this.

396
00:35:36,063 --> 00:35:39,681
You only got me when you got me

397
00:35:39,857 --> 00:35:44,234
You only squeeze me
When you squeeze me

398
00:35:44,404 --> 00:35:46,810
Hey, knock it off.

399
00:35:47,948 --> 00:35:49,822
Shut up.

400
00:35:50,576 --> 00:35:53,031
Knock it off.

401
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,407
Thank you. Thank you. I love you all.

402
00:35:56,581 --> 00:35:58,704
Excuse me.

403
00:35:59,418 --> 00:36:03,878
- Our next act will be out momentarily.
- Over here.

404
00:36:04,964 --> 00:36:06,458
How did we do, Waldo?

405
00:36:06,632 --> 00:36:08,175
We did great.

406
00:36:08,343 --> 00:36:11,260
We got a bone
with a little turkey on it.

407
00:36:11,429 --> 00:36:15,889
There's a sardine left in this can.
All kinds of good stuff.

408
00:36:16,057 --> 00:36:20,305
- Okay, Garfield, it's your...
- Out of my way, amateur.

409
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:23,265
There are a couple of things
you really should know.

410
00:36:23,439 --> 00:36:27,354
Shecky,
let's not keep my fans waiting.

411
00:36:27,527 --> 00:36:29,733
Okay, break a leg.

412
00:36:33,031 --> 00:36:35,949
Our next performer
is a comic's comic.

413
00:36:36,118 --> 00:36:41,029
Please put your paws together
for Garfield.

414
00:36:42,456 --> 00:36:44,166
Good evening, ladies and...

415
00:36:49,129 --> 00:36:51,287
You gotta bob and weave out there,
Garfield.

416
00:36:51,465 --> 00:36:53,624
A moving target is harder to hit.

417
00:36:53,801 --> 00:36:57,798
Hey, I know how to handle
a rowdy crowd.

418
00:37:02,226 --> 00:37:05,012
A smaller target
would be harder to hit too.

419
00:37:06,521 --> 00:37:09,355
As I was saying, good ev...

420
00:37:13,402 --> 00:37:17,269
I'm seriously considering retiring
from showbiz.

421
00:37:19,366 --> 00:37:20,990
It's dinnertime.

422
00:37:24,996 --> 00:37:29,623
Hey, you know,
I think you're kind of cute too.

423
00:37:30,835 --> 00:37:31,913
What?

424
00:37:32,086 --> 00:37:35,205
Oh, Garfield, really?

425
00:37:35,381 --> 00:37:39,923
Oh, yeah.
Say, are you gonna finish that fish?

426
00:37:40,093 --> 00:37:43,544
Touch it and l'll break your arm,
lover boy.

427
00:37:43,722 --> 00:37:45,631
Just like a man.

428
00:37:45,807 --> 00:37:49,057
He's truer to his stomach
than he is to me.

429
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,978
Well, we're home.

430
00:37:55,149 --> 00:37:57,935
- See you, mates.
- Good night, guys.

431
00:37:58,527 --> 00:38:01,314
- Night, Sheila.
- Night.

432
00:38:19,379 --> 00:38:21,289
Got plenty of room.

433
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,043
You'll have to excuse the mess.

434
00:38:23,216 --> 00:38:25,588
I gave the cleaning lady the week off.

435
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,710
Oh, and the elevator
is temporarily out of service.

436
00:38:29,889 --> 00:38:32,427
Watch out for that step.

437
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,509
You mean this step.

438
00:38:34,685 --> 00:38:36,344
Yeah, that's the one.

439
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:46,276
I know it's a bit of a climb,
but the view is worth it.

440
00:38:54,953 --> 00:39:01,122
Tell that to my legs and my back
and my feet and my...

441
00:39:05,172 --> 00:39:06,796
Nice.

442
00:39:06,965 --> 00:39:11,176
A room with a view,
and well ventilated too.

443
00:39:11,343 --> 00:39:13,586
My dump is your dump.

444
00:39:13,764 --> 00:39:17,096
You wouldn't happen
to have anything to eat?

445
00:39:17,266 --> 00:39:18,760
Nope.

446
00:39:19,101 --> 00:39:20,429
Is that coffee?

447
00:39:21,561 --> 00:39:24,479
Probably, but it's been sitting there
for a while.

448
00:39:24,648 --> 00:39:27,138
That's the way I like it.

449
00:39:38,994 --> 00:39:40,738
Yeah.

450
00:39:40,913 --> 00:39:43,369
What just happened?

451
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,706
- What do you mean?
- Your head.

452
00:39:46,877 --> 00:39:50,210
- What about it?
- Never mind.

453
00:39:51,881 --> 00:39:56,044
I think I need to get some sleep.
See you in the morning.

454
00:39:56,219 --> 00:39:57,879
Good night.

455
00:40:08,271 --> 00:40:12,315
There you go, buddy. Today was just
our first day in the real world.

456
00:40:12,484 --> 00:40:15,686
Tomorrow will be a better day.
You'll see.

457
00:40:21,283 --> 00:40:23,441
Well, great.

458
00:40:36,881 --> 00:40:39,122
Good night, Arlene.

459
00:40:39,675 --> 00:40:42,083
Good night, Garfield.

460
00:40:42,261 --> 00:40:43,672
Sleep well.

461
00:40:58,067 --> 00:41:00,108
Top of the morning to you, Garfield.

462
00:41:00,278 --> 00:41:03,149
- Hungry?
- Is that a trick question?

463
00:41:03,324 --> 00:41:06,193
What say we go to the park
for a little dumpster diving...

464
00:41:06,368 --> 00:41:08,859
...before the trash collectors
show up?

465
00:41:10,747 --> 00:41:12,739
That sounds good.

466
00:41:12,915 --> 00:41:18,040
Every time I think I've hit bottom,
someone hands me a shovel.

467
00:41:28,346 --> 00:41:30,422
Hey, Odie.

468
00:41:30,598 --> 00:41:34,180
Let's see how the folks back home
are faring with our strip.

469
00:41:47,655 --> 00:41:49,363
What? They're canceling my strip?

470
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:52,153
They can't do that.

471
00:41:52,327 --> 00:41:54,035
This wasn 't supposed to happen.

472
00:41:54,203 --> 00:41:56,824
It's all your fault, traitor.

473
00:41:57,748 --> 00:42:00,951
Hey, the newspaper's having a contest
to replace my strip.

474
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:05,294
Hey, guys. I have an idea.

475
00:42:05,464 --> 00:42:10,505
Odie and l'll go to the newspaper and
make sure they don't replace our strip.

476
00:42:10,677 --> 00:42:14,259
- What's he doing?
- That is one crazy cat.

477
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:18,380
All you guys have to do
is figure out a way to get us back home.

478
00:42:18,558 --> 00:42:19,674
See you there.

479
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,686
- We can do this, guys.
- That's the spirit, Garfield.

480
00:42:24,356 --> 00:42:26,846
Good luck at the newspaper contest.

481
00:42:27,025 --> 00:42:30,061
- We're here for you, Garfield.
- Yeah.

482
00:42:30,237 --> 00:42:32,063
Let's go, Odie.

483
00:42:32,238 --> 00:42:33,862
Odie?

484
00:43:34,921 --> 00:43:37,838
We're here to come up with a plan
to get Garfield and Odie.

485
00:43:38,006 --> 00:43:41,921
Don't be afraid to speak up.
Remember, there are no bad ideas.

486
00:43:45,388 --> 00:43:48,011
- Me, me, me.
- Yes, Wally?

487
00:43:48,183 --> 00:43:52,263
What if we built a device,
an interdimensional escape hatch...

488
00:43:52,437 --> 00:43:55,556
...that would pass through the screen,
equalize the pressure...

489
00:43:55,731 --> 00:44:00,192
You'll have to excuse Walter.
He's given to flights of fancy.

490
00:44:00,361 --> 00:44:03,112
Walter, dear,
your silly dreams for inventions...

491
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,863
...have never worked
and they never will.

492
00:44:07,034 --> 00:44:09,359
Yes, dear.

493
00:44:09,536 --> 00:44:13,949
Okay, any more ideas?

494
00:44:16,459 --> 00:44:18,452
Anyone?

495
00:44:35,644 --> 00:44:37,351
Have a nice day.

496
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,937
Done playing
with our little friends, are we?

497
00:44:41,149 --> 00:44:45,644
Good. Now let's go tell the newspaper
we're going home.

498
00:44:53,118 --> 00:44:55,111
This is it.

499
00:44:57,581 --> 00:44:59,953
Let's go, Odie.

500
00:45:11,092 --> 00:45:14,841
This is my comic strip, Dicky Dot.

501
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:19,224
I think he's relevant,
and quite humoresque.

502
00:45:19,392 --> 00:45:21,799
- Unlike you.
- Next.

503
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:26,726
I never get picked for anything.

504
00:45:29,985 --> 00:45:32,654
Let me guess. Siamese twins, right?

505
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,648
- Right.
- Right.

506
00:45:34,824 --> 00:45:36,649
- Funny.
- Sad.

507
00:45:36,825 --> 00:45:41,153
- Funny, in a sad sort of way.
- Take your ugly friend home.

508
00:45:41,746 --> 00:45:43,205
But he's not ugly.

509
00:45:43,372 --> 00:45:46,124
I wasn't talking to you.

510
00:45:46,292 --> 00:45:48,200
Next.

511
00:45:59,555 --> 00:46:02,045
This way, come on.

512
00:46:08,145 --> 00:46:09,769
Next.

513
00:46:15,318 --> 00:46:16,693
There they are.

514
00:46:16,861 --> 00:46:19,779
We just gotta get up there
and show them we're back.

515
00:46:19,948 --> 00:46:21,228
Now what?

516
00:46:21,824 --> 00:46:25,406
Okay, so, like, this is really funny.

517
00:46:25,578 --> 00:46:29,326
Like, when people die, my guy,
like, takes them away.

518
00:46:29,499 --> 00:46:33,543
- So, like, why don't you go away?
- Next.

519
00:46:38,424 --> 00:46:40,581
What else have we got?

520
00:46:41,592 --> 00:46:45,293
- Good afternoon, folks.
- Who are these guys?

521
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:47,843
I don't see them on the list.

522
00:46:48,349 --> 00:46:50,507
See the resemblance?

523
00:46:50,684 --> 00:46:53,934
Hey, they do kind of look like them.

524
00:46:54,104 --> 00:46:56,856
That's because it is me.

525
00:46:57,023 --> 00:47:01,187
We are pleased to announce
that we're ready to go back to work.

526
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:03,609
What's with that dog's tongue?

527
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:09,151
Must be some sort
of glandular condition.

528
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:12,031
Not a very dignified representative
of the canine family.

529
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:15,869
Hey, can a real cat do this?

530
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,949
And that cat has one big belly on him.

531
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:22,709
He would set a bad example
for the overweight youth of our nation.

532
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:24,161
- Can't have that.
- Hold on.

533
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:27,127
Hold on.
We are the real Garfield and Odie.

534
00:47:27,301 --> 00:47:29,093
And to leave no doubt in your mind...

535
00:47:29,261 --> 00:47:32,595
...we will now perform a classic gag
from our comic strip.

536
00:47:32,764 --> 00:47:36,050
Odie, if you please.

537
00:47:37,853 --> 00:47:41,352
You know, folks, a day
without kicking Odie off the table...

538
00:47:41,523 --> 00:47:45,140
...is like a day without sunshine.

539
00:47:48,321 --> 00:47:50,990
That cat just kicked the dog
off the table.

540
00:47:51,157 --> 00:47:54,241
Oh, the horror. How violent.

541
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:56,402
Hey, lighten up, lady.

542
00:47:56,579 --> 00:48:01,074
Nobody really gets hurt
in a comic strip, right, Odie?

543
00:48:03,794 --> 00:48:07,328
Sorry, pal, I forgot you can
really get hurt in the real world.

544
00:48:11,216 --> 00:48:12,795
We've seen quite enough.

545
00:48:12,968 --> 00:48:16,420
- Did I mention we'll work for scale?
- Next.

546
00:48:16,597 --> 00:48:19,763
- But you're making a big mistake.
- Next.

547
00:48:23,854 --> 00:48:25,347
Oh, boy.

548
00:48:25,522 --> 00:48:27,229
They can't do that.

549
00:48:27,398 --> 00:48:30,519
This does not bode well.

550
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:35,986
Sid, Bobby, Eric, Mike here.

551
00:48:37,616 --> 00:48:40,451
I have with me today
a licensing phenomenon...

552
00:48:40,619 --> 00:48:43,074
...destined to take the publishing biz
by storm.

553
00:48:43,246 --> 00:48:47,790
Introducing, Hale and Hardy.

554
00:49:04,181 --> 00:49:06,009
We're toast.

555
00:49:06,185 --> 00:49:07,976
These boys are positive, appealing...

556
00:49:08,144 --> 00:49:11,678
...and can generate massive licensing
income for your newspaper.

557
00:49:12,147 --> 00:49:14,306
They're toast.

558
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:17,021
These two
can have your fat, lazy readers...

559
00:49:17,194 --> 00:49:20,693
...dieting and exercising
in no time flat.

560
00:49:29,413 --> 00:49:34,241
Imagine dieting with Hale and Hardy
mineral water.

561
00:49:34,419 --> 00:49:36,991
Imagine exercising with...

562
00:49:37,171 --> 00:49:39,921
...Hale and Hardy leotards.

563
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:44,170
And Hale and Hardy dumbbells.

564
00:49:45,303 --> 00:49:50,510
In one of your franchised Hale and Hardy
wellness centers.

565
00:49:54,603 --> 00:49:55,978
But are they funny?

566
00:49:56,147 --> 00:49:57,974
Well? What do you think?

567
00:49:58,149 --> 00:50:00,686
I think we have our new comic strip.

568
00:50:00,859 --> 00:50:03,314
Hale and Hardy.

569
00:50:03,487 --> 00:50:08,149
- I can't believe this is happening.
- Oh, believe it, tubby.

570
00:50:08,325 --> 00:50:10,946
I just happen to have a contract
right here.

571
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:16,581
No, don't do it. That's me.

572
00:50:16,749 --> 00:50:20,200
Hold on a minute. Garfield
was the best comic strip we ever had.

573
00:50:20,377 --> 00:50:22,369
I'm gonna give them one last chance.

574
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:27,259
If the strip isn't back in the paper
in 24 hours...

575
00:50:27,426 --> 00:50:30,047
...we've got a deal with Hale and Hardy.

576
00:50:30,553 --> 00:50:33,259
No problemo. We'll see you tomorrow.

577
00:50:33,431 --> 00:50:35,554
Sid. You can't be serious.

578
00:50:35,725 --> 00:50:38,346
You don't honestly believe that cat
and that dog...

579
00:50:38,519 --> 00:50:40,511
...are really Garfield and Odie?

580
00:50:40,687 --> 00:50:43,855
At my age, nothing surprises me.
Humor me.

581
00:50:44,024 --> 00:50:47,274
The Garfield strip has one more day
to make it back.

582
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:51,524
Yes, sir. You're the man, Sid.
You're the man.

583
00:50:54,742 --> 00:50:56,569
- Thank you.
- Way to go, Garfield.

584
00:50:56,743 --> 00:51:00,445
We're in the comics
We're in the comics

585
00:51:00,623 --> 00:51:01,702
Back in the comics

586
00:51:01,874 --> 00:51:03,866
That strip is ours.

587
00:51:04,043 --> 00:51:08,122
Sorry "Muscles For Brains," but our strip
is going back in the paper tomorrow.

588
00:51:08,296 --> 00:51:12,341
- We'll see about that.
- Dog abuser.

589
00:51:14,093 --> 00:51:15,884
Losers.

590
00:51:16,887 --> 00:51:20,719
Come on, Odie.
We gotta find a way back home.

591
00:51:22,518 --> 00:51:24,475
Comic world, here we come.

592
00:51:24,644 --> 00:51:26,305
On your mark.

593
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,480
Get set. Go.

594
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:33,432
- Bye-bye, guys.
- They're not going anywhere.

595
00:51:33,611 --> 00:51:35,486
Leap.

596
00:51:43,037 --> 00:51:46,370
Okay. On your mark.

597
00:51:46,916 --> 00:51:48,409
Get set.

598
00:51:48,583 --> 00:51:50,576
Leap.

599
00:51:57,133 --> 00:51:59,884
Okay, I hope this works.

600
00:52:02,596 --> 00:52:06,925
Because if it doesn't, well,
at least no one will doubt our courage...

601
00:52:08,185 --> 00:52:11,270
...or our stupidity. We're out of here.

602
00:52:11,438 --> 00:52:13,347
That was close, Odie.

603
00:52:13,524 --> 00:52:15,848
Odie? Odie.

604
00:52:16,025 --> 00:52:18,231
Oh, no.

605
00:52:22,114 --> 00:52:25,234
It's not working. Nothing's working.

606
00:52:26,785 --> 00:52:28,778
Come on, Garfield, it's time to go.

607
00:52:28,955 --> 00:52:32,204
I gotta figure out a way to get back
to the comic world.

608
00:52:32,707 --> 00:52:35,874
Well, my door is always open.

609
00:52:36,627 --> 00:52:38,502
Good luck getting back into the paper.

610
00:52:38,672 --> 00:52:42,253
- Yeah, good luck.
- Cheers.

611
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:51,298
Yeah. Luck's all I have left.

612
00:53:08,282 --> 00:53:09,361
Hello?

613
00:53:09,533 --> 00:53:11,691
Anybody home?

614
00:53:12,245 --> 00:53:14,995
Just us 'toons.

615
00:53:15,163 --> 00:53:18,578
I've tried everything I know
to get back, but nothing works.

616
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:21,205
I need some help here.

617
00:53:21,378 --> 00:53:24,662
I don't even know
if you're watching this paper.

618
00:53:27,716 --> 00:53:29,840
Wait.

619
00:53:44,106 --> 00:53:45,897
Yes.

620
00:53:54,616 --> 00:53:58,116
Arlene, Eli, everybody.

621
00:53:58,286 --> 00:54:02,864
I'm sorry. I can 't believe
I ever gave a thought to coming here.

622
00:54:03,458 --> 00:54:06,909
You know what?
This isn 't the real world.

623
00:54:07,086 --> 00:54:09,292
Reality is where you heart is...

624
00:54:09,463 --> 00:54:12,748
...and my heart is with the comics,
with you guys.

625
00:54:13,466 --> 00:54:17,298
If there's a way back,
I promise you, l'll find it.

626
00:54:23,143 --> 00:54:26,059
Good night, Garfield.

627
00:54:32,944 --> 00:54:36,893
Looks like you finally got it figured out,
Garfield.

628
00:54:54,963 --> 00:54:59,044
Hey. Odie, I have an idea.

629
00:55:07,893 --> 00:55:10,562
Odie, hold up the paper.

630
00:55:11,603 --> 00:55:15,268
Eli, I hope you're watching
because I need you to get to Wally.

631
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,729
And hurry. There's no time to waste.

632
00:55:17,901 --> 00:55:22,646
Wally, come to the screen immediately.
Wally, come to the screen.

633
00:55:22,822 --> 00:55:25,740
That was the most beautiful music
I ever heard.

634
00:55:26,868 --> 00:55:27,947
Hey, kitty.

635
00:55:28,494 --> 00:55:29,989
Wally, are you there?

636
00:55:32,206 --> 00:55:33,452
Mostly.

637
00:55:33,624 --> 00:55:35,913
This could be our way back.

638
00:55:36,919 --> 00:55:38,460
What do you mean?

639
00:55:38,628 --> 00:55:40,087
Remember your concertina?

640
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:42,828
The one you rigged
to steal Bonita's cookies?

641
00:55:43,008 --> 00:55:44,667
What?

642
00:55:45,302 --> 00:55:48,504
Well, make a bigger one to rescue us.

643
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:51,384
Put doors on each end
and stretch it through the screen.

644
00:55:53,309 --> 00:55:55,182
Like this.

645
00:55:56,395 --> 00:56:00,440
Of course. It could work.
That's brilliant.

646
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:03,442
You stole my cookies.

647
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:08,355
But I need materials.
I need people with tools.

648
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:10,405
My cookies?

649
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,696
Come on, guys.
We have a concertina to build.

650
00:56:16,371 --> 00:56:19,242
Well, Odie. It's out of our hands now.

651
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:23,495
Oh, hey.
Nice work on the arpeggios there.

652
00:56:25,171 --> 00:56:26,880
Bye.

653
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:33,923
Tires. I need four tires.

654
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:40,935
Tires.

655
00:56:47,984 --> 00:56:50,521
My car.

656
00:56:52,446 --> 00:56:56,824
I need all the folding doors
you can find.

657
00:57:10,797 --> 00:57:12,873
Hey, Dagwood.

658
00:57:54,503 --> 00:57:55,702
Hey, Shecky.

659
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:59,083
Did you give up
on that crazy plan of yours?

660
00:57:59,257 --> 00:58:01,879
No, things are working out fine.

661
00:58:02,052 --> 00:58:03,547
We're just a little tired.

662
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,594
There you go, puppy.

663
00:58:05,764 --> 00:58:08,550
We've had quite an adventure
here in the real world...

664
00:58:08,725 --> 00:58:10,931
...but tomorrow will be a better day.

665
00:58:11,102 --> 00:58:14,886
And we'll be back home
and our strip will be back in the paper.

666
00:58:52,599 --> 00:58:55,054
For once you are right, kitty-cat.

667
00:58:55,226 --> 00:58:58,097
Tomorrow will be a better day...

668
00:58:59,438 --> 00:59:01,514
...for us.

669
00:59:01,982 --> 00:59:04,520
Look, we are both laughing together.

670
00:59:04,692 --> 00:59:06,816
Too bad you can't help your strip.

671
00:59:06,987 --> 00:59:10,901
Yeah, but we see you are all tied up.

672
00:59:11,407 --> 00:59:13,281
We laugh in your face again.

673
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:17,069
And tomorrow we are going to be
on the comics page.

674
00:59:17,247 --> 00:59:21,575
We will be so funny,
I find myself laughing already.

675
00:59:21,751 --> 00:59:26,080
- Look at me laughing.
- We're laughing in your face.

676
00:59:28,048 --> 00:59:30,336
You won't get away with this.

677
00:59:30,508 --> 00:59:34,636
- Just watch us.
- Let us now get out of this dump.

678
00:59:34,804 --> 00:59:39,264
- Yeah, let's.
- Who is the losers now, losers?

679
00:59:39,434 --> 00:59:42,055
Yeah, losers.

680
00:59:43,145 --> 00:59:45,268
We are laughing at you.

681
00:59:45,606 --> 00:59:46,980
Losers.

682
00:59:52,821 --> 00:59:54,730
Who are those guys?

683
00:59:54,906 --> 00:59:58,072
Don't worry. We have a plan
with the comic characters back home.

684
00:59:58,243 --> 01:00:03,865
- Knock it off, Garfield, this is serious.
- No, really, they're gonna rescue us.

685
01:00:13,214 --> 01:00:17,164
Unless, of course, we die first.

686
01:00:22,098 --> 01:00:25,099
Let's see what Garfield's up to.

687
01:00:36,278 --> 01:00:37,771
What?

688
01:00:37,946 --> 01:00:40,234
Attention. Everyone to the screen.

689
01:00:40,405 --> 01:00:43,775
Everyone to the screen.
This is an emergency.

690
01:00:46,203 --> 01:00:47,366
Hot. Hot.

691
01:00:47,788 --> 01:00:49,744
Somebody...

692
01:00:50,998 --> 01:00:52,280
Oh, no.

693
01:00:52,459 --> 01:00:56,243
I'm going through the screen.
I don't care if I ever make it back.

694
01:00:56,421 --> 01:00:57,500
No, you're not.

695
01:00:57,672 --> 01:01:00,839
We're going to rescue them
with Wally's machine. Right, Wally?

696
01:01:01,009 --> 01:01:02,883
Yeah, Wally.

697
01:01:03,511 --> 01:01:05,799
But it's not quite done.

698
01:01:05,972 --> 01:01:07,086
So let's finish it.

699
01:01:07,264 --> 01:01:10,633
But, I haven't tested it.
I don't know if it works.

700
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:12,718
There's no time for that now.

701
01:01:12,895 --> 01:01:14,602
You're the man, Wally.

702
01:01:14,771 --> 01:01:15,969
Me?

703
01:01:16,147 --> 01:01:20,227
Wally, you're gonna save the day.
You're gonna be a hero.

704
01:01:20,402 --> 01:01:23,770
Me? A hero.

705
01:01:25,239 --> 01:01:26,483
Doors.

706
01:01:26,658 --> 01:01:29,327
I need two doors.

707
01:01:35,582 --> 01:01:37,575
I got it.

708
01:01:57,352 --> 01:01:58,976
Hi.

709
01:02:00,104 --> 01:02:02,062
Ladies and gentlemen...

710
01:02:02,232 --> 01:02:07,023
...I present, The Bonitanator.

711
01:02:10,029 --> 01:02:11,573
We worked on it, but...

712
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:16,986
You don't expect it to work, do you?

713
01:02:17,161 --> 01:02:19,201
You're about to find out.

714
01:02:19,372 --> 01:02:23,701
- Move the Bonitanator into position.
- Okey-doke.

715
01:02:31,092 --> 01:02:32,716
Hold it there.

716
01:02:32,885 --> 01:02:36,549
Why did you name it
the Bonitanator, Walter?

717
01:02:36,721 --> 01:02:39,972
Because the blade on the front
reminds me of that big...

718
01:02:40,141 --> 01:02:45,728
...honking nose of yours, dear.
Now I have a job to do.

719
01:02:45,896 --> 01:02:49,348
And by the way,
I did steal your cookies.

720
01:02:49,525 --> 01:02:52,858
Oh, Wally.

721
01:02:53,028 --> 01:02:57,571
You... You're so... So...

722
01:02:58,408 --> 01:03:00,733
Forceful.

723
01:03:04,539 --> 01:03:05,867
What are you doing?

724
01:03:06,041 --> 01:03:08,496
It's too dangerous to send you guys
into the hotel.

725
01:03:08,668 --> 01:03:11,787
If the paper you go through burns up,
there's no way back.

726
01:03:11,962 --> 01:03:14,418
I'm trying to find a safer paper
out in the street.

727
01:03:17,009 --> 01:03:18,800
There we go.

728
01:03:21,012 --> 01:03:23,634
Anchor down the back end
of the Bonitanator.

729
01:03:23,848 --> 01:03:25,591
Okay.

730
01:03:28,811 --> 01:03:32,643
I need three volunteers. I'm one.

731
01:03:32,815 --> 01:03:35,934
- I'm two.
- I'm three.

732
01:03:36,109 --> 01:03:37,568
I'm three.

733
01:03:37,736 --> 01:03:40,523
This calls for a strong back, Arlene.

734
01:03:40,697 --> 01:03:42,986
Let's go, men.

735
01:03:49,748 --> 01:03:53,745
- I'm fat.
- Push us through the screen.

736
01:03:54,001 --> 01:03:55,958
- Hurry up.
- Take the right side.

737
01:03:56,169 --> 01:03:58,743
- Got it.
- On the count of three.

738
01:03:59,381 --> 01:04:02,880
One. Two.

739
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:04,838
Three.

740
01:04:50,679 --> 01:04:52,587
We made it.

741
01:04:56,016 --> 01:04:59,468
- Let's go, men.
- Okay.

742
01:05:06,275 --> 01:05:11,945
- It's stuck.
- Step aside. This is a job for a big bear.

743
01:05:22,957 --> 01:05:25,793
That's definitely not a comic door.

744
01:05:25,961 --> 01:05:27,455
Look.

745
01:05:30,923 --> 01:05:32,631
This way.

746
01:05:47,397 --> 01:05:49,603
Prepare to be rescued.

747
01:05:49,774 --> 01:05:51,602
I knew you guys would come.

748
01:05:51,776 --> 01:05:53,852
That's right.

749
01:05:54,028 --> 01:05:56,104
Hey, you're Billy Bear.

750
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,522
That's my name, don't wear it out.

751
01:05:58,699 --> 01:06:01,949
You are cartoon characters.

752
01:06:02,119 --> 01:06:04,277
You're darn tooting.

753
01:06:06,081 --> 01:06:09,331
Hey, what's Snoopy really like?

754
01:06:12,212 --> 01:06:15,046
Hurry, guys. Hurry.

755
01:06:20,553 --> 01:06:22,462
- Oh, no.
- Not good. Not good at all.

756
01:06:23,471 --> 01:06:25,096
Yeah, this way.

757
01:06:29,144 --> 01:06:30,686
What do we do now?

758
01:06:30,854 --> 01:06:32,016
Fear not gents...

759
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:34,679
...we can ride through the flames
in this trash cart.

760
01:06:34,857 --> 01:06:39,768
It may be a little rusty,
but I assure you, it is fireproof.

761
01:06:40,279 --> 01:06:42,520
Everybody climb in.

762
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:48,368
My bone, my bone. My bone.

763
01:06:49,704 --> 01:06:51,246
Odie? Get back here.

764
01:06:54,501 --> 01:06:55,829
My bone.

765
01:06:56,002 --> 01:06:57,710
Here we go.

766
01:07:12,517 --> 01:07:15,221
Odie.

767
01:07:17,897 --> 01:07:20,186
My bone.

768
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:25,851
Odie.

769
01:07:28,741 --> 01:07:30,614
Get the chandelier swinging, Odie.

770
01:07:30,784 --> 01:07:33,654
We'll grab you
from the second-floor balcony.

771
01:07:38,458 --> 01:07:41,993
- Let's do this.
- Heads down everyone. Here we go.

772
01:07:55,765 --> 01:07:56,880
Lean right, everybody.

773
01:07:57,893 --> 01:07:59,600
Lean right.

774
01:08:03,564 --> 01:08:06,138
Odie, grab my hand.

775
01:08:13,865 --> 01:08:17,199
Odie, you were supposed to let go
of the chandelier.

776
01:08:19,286 --> 01:08:23,236
Garfield, swing to the main staircase.
We'll grab you there.

777
01:08:23,416 --> 01:08:26,535
Come on, Odie,
we've got a cart to catch.

778
01:08:37,971 --> 01:08:40,426
You know, this isn't working out
as planned.

779
01:08:44,518 --> 01:08:46,594
Hold on, Odie.

780
01:08:55,278 --> 01:08:56,772
Need a lift?

781
01:08:56,989 --> 01:08:58,364
Come on.

782
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:06,580
Everybody down.

783
01:09:39,985 --> 01:09:42,275
All clear.

784
01:09:44,199 --> 01:09:46,405
We did it.

785
01:09:46,575 --> 01:09:49,244
Oh, Wally.

786
01:09:51,247 --> 01:09:54,698
Oh, my hero.

787
01:10:08,679 --> 01:10:12,890
Look out comic world, here I come.

788
01:10:16,395 --> 01:10:17,474
Hello, everybody.

789
01:10:20,190 --> 01:10:21,305
Hey, Arlene.

790
01:10:23,192 --> 01:10:24,734
Hey.

791
01:10:31,784 --> 01:10:33,491
I love you, Garfield.

792
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:36,151
Don't you ever leave me again.

793
01:10:36,330 --> 01:10:39,615
Boy, am I glad you don't hate me.

794
01:10:48,257 --> 01:10:50,582
It's good to be back.

795
01:10:59,475 --> 01:11:02,726
There's nothing to eat
in these lousy trash cans.

796
01:11:02,896 --> 01:11:06,513
I'm so hungry I could cry.

797
01:11:07,024 --> 01:11:11,769
Don't be such a girly-dog. Look.
That should be us.

798
01:11:13,197 --> 01:11:15,272
Yeah. And then we wouldn't
be so hungry.

799
01:11:15,449 --> 01:11:17,571
- It's all your fault.
- Your fault.

800
01:11:17,742 --> 01:11:19,570
- No, don't say it's my fault.
- Yours.

801
01:11:19,745 --> 01:11:22,318
- It is your fault. Don't start with me.
- Yours, yours.

802
01:11:22,497 --> 01:11:24,204
Your fault. Yo...

803
01:11:31,171 --> 01:11:32,832
Will you look at that.

804
01:11:33,465 --> 01:11:36,384
Shecky finally made it big
in entertainment.

805
01:11:37,261 --> 01:11:41,044
Who's gonna sing for food
on the fence now?

806
01:11:41,806 --> 01:11:47,430
How does this sound?
Sheila and the Sheilettes.

807
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:52,015
Got a ring, eh? You can wear
a tight dress and sing backup for me.

808
01:11:53,025 --> 01:11:55,695
We're gonna starve.

809
01:11:56,737 --> 01:12:00,105
- Hit it, Eli.
- You got it, Garfield.

810
01:12:03,369 --> 01:12:05,609
Party time.

811
01:12:20,468 --> 01:12:23,503
Hey, all right.

812
01:12:37,149 --> 01:12:39,308
Care to dance?

813
01:12:46,741 --> 01:12:48,366
You guys.

814
01:13:20,397 --> 01:13:23,149
Odie. Come back here with my bone.
