and pushing him to the ground

356
00:20:37,295 --> 00:20:40,128
he would take advantage
of such polite exit?

357
00:20:40,193 --> 00:20:43,660
I-I was trying to avoid
bigger problems for Vojtech.

358
00:20:46,326 --> 00:20:50,259
An NYPD cop just got killed
in New York.

359
00:20:50,326 --> 00:20:52,593
Do you know
what that means, Piotr?

360
00:20:54,526 --> 00:20:55,960
'Bad business.'

361
00:20:56,027 --> 00:20:58,292
'They will shut down
all illegal activities'

362
00:20:58,359 --> 00:21:00,959
'until they find
their cop killer.'

363
00:21:02,225 --> 00:21:04,724
'Now, Stazek
doesn't have documents'

364
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:07,191
because Stazek doesn't exist

365
00:21:07,258 --> 00:21:11,123
but you? NYPD will come for you.

366
00:21:11,191 --> 00:21:14,124
'The best drug runner
in Vojtech.'

367
00:21:16,658 --> 00:21:18,125
Oh, Piotr..

368
00:21:18,192 --> 00:21:21,724
This is bad business for me.

369
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:23,091
I'm sorry, Mr. Klimek.

370
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,189
(Klimek)
Oh, no. Don't be sorry.

371
00:21:25,256 --> 00:21:28,023
That feeling
doesn't take us anywhere.

372
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,124
We were talking
about business here.

373
00:21:30,191 --> 00:21:32,024
Please, sit down.

374
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:34,223
[intense music]

375
00:21:38,021 --> 00:21:39,490
Stazek tells me that

376
00:21:39,556 --> 00:21:44,256
the cop was pointing the gun
i-in your face. Correct?

377
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,655
So, Stazek saved your life.

378
00:21:51,322 --> 00:21:54,088
You now owe the price
of your life to Vojtech.

379
00:21:54,155 --> 00:21:56,321
How much is your life worth?

380
00:21:59,621 --> 00:22:01,554
I don't know.

381
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,720
Two words.

382
00:22:03,787 --> 00:22:05,288
Closed market.

383
00:22:06,586 --> 00:22:08,987
Bale Hill is a holding unit.

384
00:22:09,054 --> 00:22:12,619
It sends prisoners
all over the state.

385
00:22:12,685 --> 00:22:14,286
Hub.

386
00:22:14,353 --> 00:22:16,753
We control the product
inside the Hill.

387
00:22:16,818 --> 00:22:20,485
We control the supply
to prisons all over New York.

388
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:26,186
You did four years
at Bale Hill, right?

389
00:22:27,851 --> 00:22:29,017
[Klimek sighs]

390
00:22:29,084 --> 00:22:31,417
So if anyone
can get drugs inside

391
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:33,451
that's, that's you?

392
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:39,584
You, you want me
to control the supply inside..

393
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,950
I mean, how would I do that?

394
00:22:41,018 --> 00:22:43,183
Oh, you're a resourceful man.

395
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,851
With fentanyl, we can have

396
00:22:44,918 --> 00:22:48,982
tens of thousands hooked
on our product.

397
00:22:49,049 --> 00:22:51,249
They will work off their
debts to Vojtech.

398
00:22:51,316 --> 00:22:55,117
Not only in prison,
but afterwards on the street.

399
00:22:56,116 --> 00:22:59,750
I will own a fucking army.

400
00:22:59,817 --> 00:23:02,350
[intense music]

401
00:23:09,949 --> 00:23:11,649
[slurps]

402
00:23:12,381 --> 00:23:13,781
[gulps]

403
00:23:13,848 --> 00:23:15,081
[sighs]

404
00:23:16,614 --> 00:23:19,081
You'll break your parole.

405
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:20,981
My lawyers will convince
the judge

406
00:23:21,047 --> 00:23:23,513
to send you back to Bale Hill.

407
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:28,279
With good behavior, you'll
be released in five years max

408
00:23:28,346 --> 00:23:31,779
and our debt
will be extinguished.

409
00:23:31,847 --> 00:23:33,981
[music continues]

410
00:23:37,711 --> 00:23:39,879
My life ain't worth that much.

411
00:23:39,946 --> 00:23:41,745
[sighs]

412
00:23:41,811 --> 00:23:43,945
How much are the lives

413
00:23:44,012 --> 00:23:47,144
of your wife
and daughter worth to you?

414
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:52,112
'We found them'

415
00:23:52,179 --> 00:23:54,411
'driving around your house.'

416
00:23:55,577 --> 00:23:57,044
So frightened.

417
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:59,477
Suitcase filled with clothes.

418
00:23:59,544 --> 00:24:01,477
[music continues]

419
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:09,844
You informed them
what happened at Techniska.

420
00:24:09,911 --> 00:24:12,177
I-I just, I told them
to get out of the house.

421
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,908
Where-where are they?

422
00:24:13,976 --> 00:24:15,576
(Klimek)
'Outside.'

423
00:24:15,642 --> 00:24:17,276
'Waiting for you.'

424
00:24:18,943 --> 00:24:20,107
Oh, don't worry.

425
00:24:20,174 --> 00:24:23,807
Sofia and Anna will be okay..

426
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:26,509
...while you're inside.

427
00:24:28,674 --> 00:24:30,608
[music continues]

428
00:24:33,574 --> 00:24:34,541
Now..

429
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:38,275
...fuck off.

430
00:24:38,342 --> 00:24:40,073

438
00:25:57,866 --> 00:25:59,099
(Wilcox)
'You safe?'

439
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:00,634
You guys left me
in the fuckin' lurch.

440
00:26:00,699 --> 00:26:03,166
You were supposed to take us
directly to The General.

441
00:26:03,233 --> 00:26:04,799
(Pete)
'I can't call those shots.'

442
00:26:04,866 --> 00:26:06,700
I'm only a soldier. I do
what I'm told. You understand?

443
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:09,300
Only a soldier? You just
brought in six Ki's for them.

444
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:11,066
It would've raised suspicion.

445
00:26:11,132 --> 00:26:12,732
They would've stripped me naked.

446
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,464
(Wilcox) 'Look,
meet me tonight and hope we can'

447
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,166
salvage something,
otherwise four years

448
00:26:16,232 --> 00:26:17,798
of hard work just
went down the fuckin' drain.

449
00:26:17,865 --> 00:26:19,765
What the fuck you talkin'
about..

450
00:26:19,832 --> 00:26:21,299
Are you fuck..

451
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:24,266
(Nina) 'Anna,
do you wanna come and play?'

452

[exhales]

453
00:26:25,365 --> 00:26:26,731
Do you wanna go play with Nina?

454
00:26:26,797 --> 00:26:29,197
- Listen, sweetie...
- She's fine. Don't, now.

455
00:26:29,263 --> 00:26:31,031
(Nina)
'I can see you.'

456
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:34,230
[sighs]

457
00:26:34,297 --> 00:26:36,130
- 'Hi.'
- 'Hi, Nina, You wanna play?'

458
00:26:36,197 --> 00:26:37,398
- Yeah.
- Go ahead.

459
00:26:37,465 --> 00:26:39,829
- Come on.
- Go the the backyard.

[door closes]

461
00:26:42,329 --> 00:26:43,562
Why didn't you do
what I fuckin' told you to?

462
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,496
Just one sec.

463
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:46,830
Why didn't you fuckin' leave?

464
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,531
Pete, you've got blood
all over you.

465
00:26:48,596 --> 00:26:50,962
Answer my question.
Why didn't you protect Anna?

466
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:52,728
I wanna know what's going on.

467
00:26:52,795 --> 00:26:54,196
Why didn't you protect Anna?

468
00:26:54,262 --> 00:26:55,730
- I'm sorry, I'm...
- I don't wanna hear sorry.

469
00:26:55,795 --> 00:26:57,162
I don't wanna hear
fuckin' sorry.

470
00:26:57,229 --> 00:26:59,496
You were supposed to take Anna
away from there, 1 p.m.

471
00:26:59,563 --> 00:27:01,062
You think these people
would have a fuckin' problem

472
00:27:01,129 --> 00:27:02,162
in killing the both of you?

473
00:27:02,228 --> 00:27:03,928
[yells]
We tried.

474
00:27:04,896 --> 00:27:05,929
[crying]
We fuckin' tried!

475
00:27:05,995 --> 00:27:07,428
We kept driving around the block

476
00:27:07,494 --> 00:27:08,994
hoping you'd be back.

477
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:10,562
Fuck you!

Driver's license says
it's Carlos Harrera.

494
00:28:55,353 --> 00:28:57,718
His real name was Daniel Gomez.

495
00:28:57,784 --> 00:28:58,918
Who the fuck are you?

496
00:28:58,985 --> 00:29:01,051
Detective Edward Grens,
organized crime.

497
00:29:01,118 --> 00:29:04,951
- He was one of mine.
- 'What happened here?'

498
00:29:05,017 --> 00:29:06,451
He was supposed to be
a low-level buy

499
00:29:06,517 --> 00:29:07,485
off the street tip.

500
00:29:07,552 --> 00:29:09,983
They cut his throat,
pulled out his tongue.

501
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,884
They knew he was a cop.

502
00:29:11,951 --> 00:29:13,852
'What'd you say his name was?'

00:29:14,484 --> 00:29:15,618

- Hey.
- Hey.

509
00:30:23,412 --> 00:30:25,878
Thanks for takin' me here.
It's so romantic of you.

510
00:30:25,945 --> 00:30:27,278
Yeah, dig in.

Shut up and eat, girl.

513
00:30:30,844 --> 00:30:32,844
Homicide talk about anything?

514
00:30:32,911 --> 00:30:34,445
Like what?

515
00:30:34,509 --> 00:30:37,776
I think Daniel's connection
was Polish.

516
00:30:37,843 --> 00:30:39,443
Entire NYPD force
in this manhunt.

517
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,876
You don't see to sharing
this little fuckin' detail?

518
00:30:41,942 --> 00:30:44,244
I gotta check my sources
before they get spooked

519
00:30:44,311 --> 00:30:46,109
by the stampede.

520
00:30:46,176 --> 00:30:48,675
You heard of Ryszard Klimek,
aka "The General."

521
00:30:48,742 --> 00:30:50,276
Hmm. Polish crime boss, right?

522
00:30:50,343 --> 00:30:52,443
Came over from Poland
after serving 20 years

523
00:30:52,509 --> 00:30:55,075
in some shithole
Eastern European dungeon.

524
00:30:55,143 --> 00:30:57,276
Now he's moving pieces
all over the board.

525
00:30:57,343 --> 00:30:59,908
You think he has something to do
with Daniel?

[bike revving in distance]

527
00:31:02,075 --> 00:31:04,508
Gomez was killed in this bar
in Little Poland.

528
00:31:04,576 --> 00:31:06,074
'It's impossible
to trace its owners'

529
00:31:06,141 --> 00:31:08,242

to The General.'

530
00:31:08,307 --> 00:31:10,374
'Security cameras across
the street record Gomez'

531
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,339
entering at 11:09,
then at 11:27 this guy pops up.

532
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:18,239
Look at his body language. This
is a man who's just done bad.

533
00:31:18,306 --> 00:31:20,974
- What do you need?
- Your badge.

534
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,507
IAS comin' after me.

535
00:31:22,572 --> 00:31:23,872
Christ, Eddie.

536
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,273
I sent a man
when he wasn't ready.

537
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,573
This is on me.

538
00:31:29,938 --> 00:31:32,072
[train brakes screeching]

539
00:31:34,105 --> 00:31:35,439
Hold on a second. Watch my six.

540
00:31:35,506 --> 00:31:37,939
That girl over there
was Daniel's source.

541
00:31:41,971 --> 00:31:43,205
Shit.

542
00:31:46,272 --> 00:31:47,905
Shit. Help, help,
help, help, help!

543
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:50,337
'I'll give anyone $20
who stops the <i>puto</i> behind me!'

544
00:31:50,405 --> 00:31:51,837
- Whoa!
- Help me out! Help me out!

545
00:31:52,901 --> 00:31:53,371
- 'Move! Nigga, move!'
- Hold on.

546
00:31:53,438 --> 00:31:54,971
NYPD! Get the fuck back!

547
00:31:55,036 --> 00:31:57,838
(Grens) Tell me what happened to Daniel?
Tell me what happened to Daniel?

548
00:31:57,904 --> 00:32:00,071
- Daniel...
- I don't know nothin'! Okay?

549
00:32:00,136 --> 00:32:01,737
You got Gomez killed.

550
00:32:01,804 --> 00:32:03,904
[indistinct chatter]

551
00:32:05,136 --> 00:32:06,570
Hey, Grens, you wanna talk to me
for a second?

552
00:32:06,637 --> 00:32:09,036
Hey, Ed. Hey, Eddie,
you wanna talk to me outside?

553
00:32:09,103 --> 00:32:10,969
Ed, outside, please?
Right now. Ed?

554
00:32:11,036 --> 00:32:12,937
You're gonna be down.

555
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:18,735
What are you doing? You wanna
get these motherfuckers?

556
00:32:18,802 --> 00:32:19,868
Oh, this bitch better talk.

557
00:32:19,934 --> 00:32:22,301
You are scaring
the shit out of her.

558
00:32:22,368 --> 00:32:24,135
You wanna calm down,
you wanna be professional

559
00:32:24,201 --> 00:32:26,135
and let me do this, alright?

560
00:32:27,201 --> 00:32:29,468
- Do what you gotta do.
- You stay here.

561
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:37,900
Hey, honey, you wanna
scooch over for a second please?

562
00:32:57,698 --> 00:32:59,832
Stazek carved him up like that?

563
00:33:01,598 --> 00:33:03,364
You think I'd fuckin' do that?

564
00:33:03,431 --> 00:33:05,764
I'm just trying to find
a professional way to say this.

565
00:33:05,831 --> 00:33:08,564
- Say what?
- You're fucked, Koslow.

566
00:33:08,629 --> 00:33:10,897
- Wait, who the fuck is he?
- 'He's my boss.'

567
00:33:10,964 --> 00:33:12,764
We tried to close the case
on The General

568
00:33:12,831 --> 00:33:14,030
and bury this whole mess.

569
00:33:14,096 --> 00:33:16,762
But Washington labelled
the case as weak

570
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,596
and took the embassy
off the table.

571
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,096
W-w-with all due respect, sir,
what the fuck you talkin'

572
00:33:21,162 --> 00:33:22,430
about taking the embassy
off the table?

573
00:33:22,496 --> 00:33:24,129
You just watched me
smuggle a dozen Ki's

574
00:33:24,196 --> 00:33:27,128
through Polish diplomatic
pouches.

575
00:33:27,195 --> 00:33:28,863
Deal was to give you enough
evidence so you could

576
00:33:28,929 --> 00:33:30,629
indict The General,
which I have fuckin'

577
00:33:30,696 --> 00:33:32,495
over-delivered at this point.

578
00:33:33,728 --> 00:33:35,862
'Look, I've done my part.'

579
00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:39,028
I-I want out.

580
00:33:39,094 --> 00:33:42,761
Agent Wilcox here has a plan
to keep your status alive.

581
00:33:42,828 --> 00:33:44,860
You should listen to her
and hope I like it

582
00:33:44,927 --> 00:33:49,627
'cause in my book,
you're old news, my friend.

583
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,260
(Wilcox) 'Pete,
I think there's a way out of this.'

584
00:33:52,327 --> 00:33:54,559
We go along with
The General's plan.

585
00:33:54,626 --> 00:33:57,193
Evidence of fentanyl being
methodically distributed

586
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:00,260
inside a state prison
buries Ryszard Klimek for good.

587
00:34:00,327 --> 00:34:04,359
And if that happens,
you're a free man.

588
00:34:04,426 --> 00:34:06,959
[intense music]

589
00:34:09,759 --> 00:34:11,458
The fuck you talking about?

590
00:34:13,492 --> 00:34:15,126
Go back to prison?

591
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:18,992
That was never part of the plan.

592
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:20,725
And where is the part
of the plan where you become

593
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:23,458
an accessory to the murder
of an undercover policeman?

594
00:34:23,525 --> 00:34:25,256
How am I an accessory
when I try to help him?

595
00:34:25,323 --> 00:34:27,624
I mean, it's all on the tape.
And you guys put me there.

596
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:31,290
If I inform the NYPD
that I'm working with a witness

597
00:34:31,357 --> 00:34:34,556
to Officer Daniel Gomez's murder
you will be exposed.

598
00:34:34,623 --> 00:34:38,824
If you're exposed,
General's case falls apart.

599
00:34:41,323 --> 00:34:42,324
If I say no?

600
00:34:42,391 --> 00:34:44,224
Prosecutor will have
you serve the remaining

601
00:34:44,289 --> 00:34:46,189
twelve years of your sentence
and then tack on

602
00:34:46,255 --> 00:34:48,389
whatever the NYPD pins on you.

603
00:34:48,456 --> 00:34:50,722
[music continues]

604
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:52,557
[scoffs]

605
00:34:54,055 --> 00:34:56,454
Some fuckin' bullshit.

606
00:34:57,522 --> 00:34:59,056
I tried to help him.

607
00:34:59,122 --> 00:35:02,322
You're a convicted felon who was
present when one of their own

608
00:35:02,387 --> 00:35:04,021
was nearly beheaded.

609
00:35:05,288 --> 00:35:07,955
You should think
of your family, Pete.

610
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,453
Look, once you're in charge
like The General wants

611
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,587
you just build a list
of all the inmates

612
00:35:13,654 --> 00:35:15,354
and COs distributing for him.

613
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,687
'Everyone's a potential nail
to crucify'

614
00:35:17,752 --> 00:35:19,553
'that son of a bitch.'

615
00:35:21,086 --> 00:35:22,986
I need to know you're in.

616
00:35:23,053 --> 00:35:25,586
[music continues]

617
00:35:37,151 --> 00:35:38,818
And let me guess,
if I fuck up and bail

618
00:35:38,883 --> 00:35:40,552
then I'm alone, right?

619
00:35:41,851 --> 00:35:43,485
Don't fuck up.

620
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:46,518
[scoffs]

621
00:35:48,317 --> 00:35:50,250
[dramatic music]

622
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,984
[car engine cranking]

623
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:06,350
[music continues]

624
00:36:30,947 --> 00:36:33,246
(Wilcox on tape) 'Look, once you're
in charge, like The General wants'

625
00:36:33,313 --> 00:36:35,146
'you just build a list
of all the inmates'

626
00:36:35,213 --> 00:36:37,112
'and COs distributing for him.'

627
00:36:37,179 --> 00:36:40,846
'Everyone's a potential nail to
crucify that son of a bitch.'

628
00:36:43,612 --> 00:36:45,279
'I need to know you're in.'

629
00:36:45,755 --> 00:36:47,521
(Peter on tape) 'And let me
guess, if I fuck up and bail'

630
00:36:47,588 --> 00:36:50,422
'then I'm alone, right?'

631
00:36:50,487 --> 00:36:52,020
(Wilcox on tape)
'Don't fuck up.'

632
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,253
[music continues]

633
00:37:03,552 --> 00:37:06,453
(Kat)
'Yeah. Thank you.'

634
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:09,751
'Alright. Thank you.'

635
00:37:09,819 --> 00:37:12,486
Yeah. Thank you.
Buh-bye. Buh-bye.

636
00:37:12,552 --> 00:37:15,085
Okay. Got a couple
hits on the names.

637
00:37:15,152 --> 00:37:17,618
First's a Pole,
street name's Stazek.

638
00:37:17,685 --> 00:37:19,985
Real name unknown,
whereabouts unknown.

639
00:37:20,051 --> 00:37:21,283
Unfortunately, that's it on him.

640
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:22,984
He was probably
recently imported.

641
00:37:23,051 --> 00:37:24,717
Well, what about the American?

642
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,085
This is where
it gets interesting.

643
00:37:26,151 --> 00:37:28,816
- Peter Koslow, he's a..
- What?

644
00:37:28,883 --> 00:37:32,216
"Complex. Born here,
parents immigrated from Poland.

645
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:33,583
"Gulf War vet, sniper.

646
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,317
"Served an additional
four tours in Iraq.

647
00:37:35,384 --> 00:37:38,083
"Medals, medical history,
post-traumatic stress disorder..

648
00:37:38,149 --> 00:37:39,649
"Crashed and burned
a few years ago.

649
00:37:39,717 --> 00:37:42,549
"Manslaughter, got 20 years for
killing a guy in a bar fight.

650
00:37:42,617 --> 00:37:45,048
- Then it's weird.
- Weird, how?

651
00:37:45,115 --> 00:37:47,550
Well, the file looks like
it's been redacted.

652
00:37:47,617 --> 00:37:49,183
"Paroled from Bale Hill
after four

653
00:37:49,249 --> 00:37:51,414
pending the full investigation
of new evidence."

654
00:37:51,482 --> 00:37:52,881
Doesn't add up though.

655
00:37:52,948 --> 00:37:55,415
Well, who could fuck with
his jacket like that.

656
00:37:56,582 --> 00:37:58,581
Feds is my guess.

657
00:37:58,648 --> 00:38:00,280
Can you dig into this Fed angle?

658
00:38:00,348 --> 00:38:02,081
You can't just fuckin'
poke around the Feds

659
00:38:02,148 --> 00:38:03,848
like they're one of your
junkie hookers, Grens.

660
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:06,580
Look, I-I think this is the guy
who shot Daniel.

661
00:38:06,647 --> 00:38:08,280
You said Bale Hill, right?

662
00:38:08,346 --> 00:38:10,112
Bale Hill was part
of Daniel's cover story.

663
00:38:10,179 --> 00:38:12,346
He liked it because
his old man served time there

664
00:38:12,414 --> 00:38:14,847
but that was years ago,
if this guy was fresh out

665
00:38:14,913 --> 00:38:17,080
he could've tripped
the kid up on something.

666
00:38:17,148 --> 00:38:18,847
[indistinct chatter in distance]

667
00:38:18,913 --> 00:38:20,746
Let me see what I can do.

668
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:26,013
Oh, shit. Got a breakfast date
with my sweetheart.

669
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,779
Wait, this guy you're runnin'
to, is this somebody special?

670
00:38:28,844 --> 00:38:30,244
[chuckles]
You jealous?

671
00:38:30,311 --> 00:38:32,545
I'm just hoping his name
ain't fucking Logan

672
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:35,246
or-or Chad or Brett.

673
00:38:36,777 --> 00:38:40,078
Laila. Her name is Laila.

674
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,877
Laila?

675
00:38:45,944 --> 00:38:47,511
Kat, why didn't you
tell me that?

676
00:38:47,577 --> 00:38:48,909
[Kat laughs]

677
00:38:48,976 --> 00:38:51,475
La.. Yo, I-I should come with
you and Laila!

678
00:38:51,543 --> 00:38:53,444
Y'all want a chaperone?

679
00:38:55,677 --> 00:38:58,210
[knocking on door]

680
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:07,175
- What are you doing here?
- We have to talk.

681
00:39:07,242 --> 00:39:08,609
Important stuff.

682
00:39:08,676 --> 00:39:09,941
Don't ever come knocking
on my fuckin' door.

683
00:39:10,009 --> 00:39:11,876
Go to the garage.

684
00:39:16,741 --> 00:39:19,274
[speaking in foreign language]

685
00:39:29,307 --> 00:39:31,640
[sighs]

686
00:39:31,707 --> 00:39:33,708
All night awake, fuck!

687
00:39:33,773 --> 00:39:35,738
What happened?

688
00:39:35,805 --> 00:39:37,839
I had to do some sweeping.

689
00:39:37,906 --> 00:39:40,073
They guy you did time with.

690
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,739
- Whitey?
- Yeah, Whitey.

691
00:39:41,806 --> 00:39:44,106
We found him 30 minutes ago.

692
00:39:45,872 --> 00:39:47,805
Why don't you fuckin'
listen to me?

693
00:39:47,872 --> 00:39:49,306
I told you, the cop
just used his name.

694
00:39:49,371 --> 00:39:50,438
He's a straight guy.

695
00:39:50,505 --> 00:39:52,905
[chuckles]
You can complain to my uncle.

696
00:39:52,972 --> 00:39:54,538
He wants to see you.

697
00:39:54,604 --> 00:39:57,003
- Your wife good cook?
- Why?

698
00:39:57,070 --> 00:40:01,005
It's an old tradition to invite
boss home before prison.

699
00:40:02,403 --> 00:40:05,370
You sell two of this
to break your parole.

700
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:06,837
Rest until Bale Hill.

701
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,403
Yeah, I still gotta figure out
a way outta here.

702
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:11,003
Figure it out fast, Piotr.

703
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:13,603
Detective sniffing around
Little Poland.

704
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:15,804
Monday you need to be inside.

705
00:40:17,537 --> 00:40:20,302
Kalash told me you went out
last night, motherfucker.

706
00:40:20,369 --> 00:40:21,370
Where did you go?

707
00:40:21,437 --> 00:40:22,802
It's none
of your fuckin' business.

708
00:40:22,868 --> 00:40:25,370
Come on, I want to know.
Where did you go?

709
00:40:26,969 --> 00:40:29,070
My wife's next door.

710
00:40:29,936 --> 00:40:31,636
You have <i>kurba?</i>

711
00:40:31,702 --> 00:40:33,235
[chuckles]

712
00:40:33,301 --> 00:40:35,368
She good fun?

713
00:40:35,435 --> 00:40:37,968
Huh? Who is she?

714
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:41,335
Come on, tell me,
you mind if I bonk her a while

715
00:40:41,401 --> 00:40:43,835
when you're inside?

716
00:40:43,901 --> 00:40:45,734
You touch any of my things
when I'm inside

717
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,434
and I'll carve
your fuckin' eyes out.

718
00:40:51,801 --> 00:40:54,933
[dramatic music]

719
00:40:58,766 --> 00:41:00,867
[door opens and shuts]

720
00:41:06,033 --> 00:41:07,633
When?

721
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:10,065
Tomorrow? In a month?

722
00:41:10,132 --> 00:41:12,031
When?

723
00:41:12,098 --> 00:41:13,698
Two days.

724
00:41:17,164 --> 00:41:20,265
[sniffles] If you go back
inside, you'll never get out.

725
00:41:23,764 --> 00:41:25,731
You know that, do you?

726
00:41:25,797 --> 00:41:28,330
[intense music]

727
00:41:31,396 --> 00:41:33,330
[birds squawking]

728
00:41:37,129 --> 00:41:38,696
Are you happy
to spend the day with daddy?

729
00:41:38,763 --> 00:41:40,030
Uh-hmm.

730
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:43,196
What are you doing?

731
00:41:43,263 --> 00:41:45,062
You see that down there?

732
00:41:45,129 --> 00:41:47,429
That's where I'll be going
on my business trip.

733
00:41:47,495 --> 00:41:49,029
But I don't want you to go.

734
00:41:49,096 --> 00:41:51,728
I know, sweetie, but what if I
told you this was the last time.

735
00:41:51,794 --> 00:41:53,162
[phone beeps]

736
00:41:55,294 --> 00:41:56,827
Okay. Gotta go.

737
00:41:56,895 --> 00:42:00,029
[dramatic music]

738
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:10,793
[exhales]

739
00:42:16,626 --> 00:42:19,259
(Wilcox) <i>New warden's
name is James Leonard.</i>

740
00:42:19,327 --> 00:42:20,661
He's been briefed.

741
00:42:20,726 --> 00:42:22,859
You give him the list,
he'll put you in solitary

742
00:42:22,925 --> 00:42:25,025
and then in 24 hours
the appellate court judge will

743
00:42:25,093 --> 00:42:26,325
put you back on the streets.

744
00:42:26,392 --> 00:42:28,625
Daddy, you're too loud.
I can't hear my movie.

745
00:42:28,692 --> 00:42:30,391
Uh, I know.
I'm sorry, sweetie.

746
00:42:30,459 --> 00:42:33,258
Yeah, j-just watch your movie.

747
00:42:36,825 --> 00:42:39,124
Sofia and Anna will be
in a FBI safe house

748
00:42:39,191 --> 00:42:41,758
before Klimek evens knows
what happened.

749
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:44,590
You have my absolute word
on that.

750
00:42:44,656 --> 00:42:48,124
Uh, look, um,
I'm gonna need three favors.

751
00:42:49,758 --> 00:42:53,423
First, I'll need a major drug
sweep day after I get there

752
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:55,323
to dry up the competition.

753
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:59,790
And second,
have, uh, Warden Leonard..

754
00:42:59,856 --> 00:43:03,221
...put me on program
post detail.

755
00:43:03,288 --> 00:43:07,223
And third, in six days..

756
00:43:07,288 --> 00:43:09,887
...courier these beautiful
yellow wonders

757
00:43:09,955 --> 00:43:11,222
to a Deputy Superintendent

758
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:13,253
Reseda Johnson
compliments of the bureau

759
00:43:13,321 --> 00:43:14,921
so the prison receives
them on Founders' Day.

760
00:43:14,988 --> 00:43:16,822
And, there's got to be a
government seal on the package...

761
00:43:16,889 --> 00:43:19,921
I can't do this, Pete.

762
00:43:19,988 --> 00:43:22,054
You know, if the prosecutor
finds out that I helped

763
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,420
people get high, he'll destroy
me, you, and the case.

764
00:43:25,487 --> 00:43:26,854
You..

765
00:43:27,986 --> 00:43:30,553
You gotta fuckin'
help me out here.

766
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,254
I can't do it.

767
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:35,220
It won't come through, if
it don't come from you guys.

768
00:43:50,118 --> 00:43:51,285
Hmm.

769
00:43:54,518 --> 00:43:57,084
Have Leonard assign me
to roof and yard maintenance.

770
00:43:57,151 --> 00:44:00,084
That I'll do,
the drug sweep I'll also do

771
00:44:00,151 --> 00:44:01,783
but the rest you're on your own.

772
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:04,984
[siren wailing in a distance]

773
00:44:06,416 --> 00:44:07,815
How's Sofia holdin' up?

774
00:44:07,883 --> 00:44:09,750
Just fuckin' great.

775
00:44:09,816 --> 00:44:12,150
[phone vibrating]

776
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:16,450
- I'm sorry. I gotta take this.
- Yeah.

777
00:44:16,516 --> 00:44:18,383
One second, boss.

778
00:44:19,783 --> 00:44:21,417
I gotta go.

779
00:44:24,249 --> 00:44:26,050
You'll be fine.

780
00:44:30,414 --> 00:44:32,348

781
00:44:34,181 --> 00:44:37,315

[speaking in foreign language]

786
00:44:58,546 --> 00:45:01,979
Pete, you should have told me
we have friends coming tonight.

787
00:45:02,045 --> 00:45:03,211
They brought me so many presents

788
00:45:03,278 --> 00:45:04,779
to keep me comfortable
when you're away.

789
00:45:04,845 --> 00:45:06,946
You have such an adorable
wife, Piotr.

790
00:45:07,011 --> 00:45:09,612
- Beata. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

791
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:11,477
(Klimek) 'We should get
this little creature in bed'

792
00:45:11,544 --> 00:45:15,911
then we can celebrate.
Let's go. I will help.

793
00:45:15,978 --> 00:45:18,710
- It's okay, I got it.
- No, no, no, no. Please.

794
00:45:18,777 --> 00:45:20,844
Piotr, I insist.

795
00:45:22,245 --> 00:45:23,811
'After you.'

796
00:45:39,275 --> 00:45:42,376
I don't have kids, Pete.
I regret it.

797
00:45:42,443 --> 00:45:44,243
Must be wonderful.

798
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,708
It is.

799
00:45:47,708 --> 00:45:50,776
Beata wants them,
but I'm afraid..

800
00:45:50,841 --> 00:45:54,109
I would suffer too much
if something happened to them.

801
00:45:55,409 --> 00:45:58,109
Imagine someone hurts them.

802
00:46:00,573 --> 00:46:05,207
In the honor of bravery of
Pete's, his courageous wife

803
00:46:05,273 --> 00:46:10,006
here is a Polish song entitled
"I Used To Be A Rose"

804
00:46:10,074 --> 00:46:14,739
which talks about the love
we give to our partners.

805
00:46:14,806 --> 00:46:16,406
- <i>Na Zdrowie.</i>
- <i>Na Zdrowie.</i>

806

813
00:47:14,867 --> 00:47:17,368
Yeah.
You need more reason to dig?

814
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:20,366
The General just left
the Koslow residence.

815
00:47:20,433 --> 00:47:22,767
(Sofia) Honey,
you want to go to the zoo or not?

816
00:47:22,834 --> 00:47:24,634
Let's go to the zoo, come on.

817
00:47:24,701 --> 00:47:25,934
'We'll be back
in a couple of hours.'

818
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,832
- Okay.
- Be a good girl, okay?

819
00:47:28,899 --> 00:47:30,199
(Pete) You know daddy
loves you very much.

820
00:47:30,266 --> 00:47:33,032
(Anna)
I know. Can I go now?

821
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,533
- 'Anna, come on!'
- Pete?

822
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,666
Pete, come on.

823
00:47:37,732 --> 00:47:39,033
Give me a kiss, eh?

824
00:47:39,098 --> 00:47:40,899
- Mwah!
- See you later, guys.

825
00:47:40,964 --> 00:47:43,764
- Bye! Have fun.
- Bye! Love you!

826
00:47:43,832 --> 00:47:46,532

Those kids with a drone.

832
00:48:10,997 --> 00:48:12,328
Better call them today.

833
00:48:12,395 --> 00:48:15,363
Pete, don't worry.
I don't want you to worry.

834
00:48:15,429 --> 00:48:18,196
- I'll take care of it.
- You still got the key?

835
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:21,062
It's right here.

836

Please, I need help.
My husband's going crazy!

840
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,693
He wants to kill me.
Please send someone fast!

00:48:54,893 --> 00:48:56,358
'Do you have any children
in the house?'

844
00:48:56,425 --> 00:48:58,659

Second time around, huh?

853
00:50:03,353 --> 00:50:05,653
I want you to stand
right there for me.

854
00:50:11,585 --> 00:50:14,019
Oh, what language is that?

855
00:50:14,086 --> 00:50:16,619
I don't know.
I was drunk when I did it.

856
00:50:16,686 --> 00:50:18,518
Maybe Chinese or something.

857
00:50:18,585 --> 00:50:20,686
You're not gonna tell me, huh?

858
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:24,752

Last term you become a courier
on behalf of the Poles.

861

Look at you. They gave you
the white shirts, Slewitt.

862
00:50:34,718 --> 00:50:37,050
- His bed been assigned?
- Not yet.

863
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,551
I got this.

864
00:50:38,617 --> 00:50:40,016
Welcome back, Koslow.

865
00:50:40,083 --> 00:50:42,751

- What up, Slewitt?
- Smiley, this is Koslow.

882
00:51:56,276 --> 00:51:59,209
Your new celley.
Try to make him feel at home.

883
00:51:59,276 --> 00:52:01,211
[indistinct chatter]

884
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:06,243
Hey, don't be scared.
They'll be gentle.

885
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:07,944
Won't you, boys?

886
00:52:12,509 --> 00:52:15,408
The Prodigal Son returns.

887
00:52:15,474 --> 00:52:18,207
I need two extra mats.

888
00:52:18,275 --> 00:52:20,376
You and you, roll it up.

889
00:52:20,442 --> 00:52:23,075
It's your lucky day, dickheads..

890
00:52:23,142 --> 00:52:25,874
[speaking in foreign language]

891
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,474
Each and every business that
takes places under the roof

892
00:52:34,541 --> 00:52:36,940
of this facility
runs through me.

893
00:52:37,906 --> 00:52:40,373
Comply or I crucify you.

894
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,206
- Get back to your block.
- Yes, sir.

895
00:52:45,273 --> 00:52:48,207
[indistinct chatter]

896
00:52:53,373 --> 00:52:55,306
[speaking in foreign language]

897
00:52:57,206 --> 00:52:59,906
[dog panting]

898
00:52:59,973 --> 00:53:02,206
(male #4)
'Rise and shine, ladies!'

899
00:53:02,272 --> 00:53:05,204
[clamoring]

900
00:53:13,004 --> 00:53:16,504
It's time to get the fuck off.

901
00:53:16,571 --> 00:53:18,237
Name?

902
00:53:18,303 --> 00:53:20,036
Koslow, Pete.

903
00:53:23,769 --> 00:53:25,936
Previous term
you kept yourself busy, huh?

904
00:53:26,003 --> 00:53:28,703
Roofing, HVAC maintenance?

905
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:30,668
We should get you
on the program, Mr. Koslow.

906
00:53:30,735 --> 00:53:32,837
I appreciate that, warden.

907
00:53:34,036 --> 00:53:35,103
Name?

908
00:53:36,601 --> 00:53:38,534
That guy.

909
00:53:38,601 --> 00:53:41,834
- This guy.
- Hands up. Legs spread.

910
00:53:41,901 --> 00:53:43,734
- 'Next. Hey.'
- 'You.'

911
00:53:43,801 --> 00:53:46,001
[indistinct chatter]

912
00:53:46,068 --> 00:53:47,768
(male #5)
'This dumb fuck.'

913
00:53:48,733 --> 00:53:51,868
[indistinct chatter]

914
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,699
They swept the whole place..
Bone-dry.

915
00:54:01,766 --> 00:54:03,498
That's a lucky break for us.

916
00:54:03,565 --> 00:54:05,333
Product will be here soon.

917
00:54:06,867 --> 00:54:10,000
[speaking in foreign language]

918
00:54:20,165 --> 00:54:21,965
Under the table.

919
00:54:23,066 --> 00:54:25,999
[dramatic music]

920
00:54:31,798 --> 00:54:33,931
[indistinct chatter]

921
00:54:45,596 --> 00:54:46,795
[phone beeps]

922
00:54:46,862 --> 00:54:49,597
[indistinct chatter]

923
00:54:58,929 --> 00:55:02,461
- Who?
- K-O-S-L-O-W.

924
00:55:02,528 --> 00:55:04,129
Comma Peter.

925
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,919
- I'm sorry, I don't...
- Uh, don't apologize.

926
00:55:36,986 --> 00:55:38,820
Me, I'm old-school,
I knock on doors

927
00:55:38,886 --> 00:55:40,853
get-right-there-in-your-face
type of cop.

928
00:55:40,918 --> 00:55:43,285
Wilcox, we gotta go.

929
00:55:43,353 --> 00:55:44,785
Sorry. You are?

930
00:55:44,852 --> 00:55:48,018
Detective Edward Grens
from the NYPD.

931
00:55:48,085 --> 00:55:50,151
- Everything good?
- Yeah.

932
00:55:50,218 --> 00:55:51,685
We're just having a conversation

933
00:55:51,753 --> 00:55:54,852
about somebody named
Peter Koslow.

934
00:55:54,919 --> 00:55:56,484
'Decorated vet.'

935
00:55:56,551 --> 00:55:59,517
Driver slash security
for the Polish Consulate.

936
00:55:59,583 --> 00:56:02,817
Fast-tracked almost smells
like a bogus parole violation.

937
00:56:02,883 --> 00:56:04,351
Back into Bale Hill.

938
00:56:04,416 --> 00:56:06,516
Same prison he was serving
20 years for murder

939
00:56:06,582 --> 00:56:09,183
before somebody pulled him out
pending the investigation

940
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:10,984
of new evidence.

941
00:56:11,051 --> 00:56:13,550
Anyway, I want to know
why your subordinate's name

942
00:56:13,617 --> 00:56:16,382
keeps popping up around
this admittedly suspicious

943
00:56:16,449 --> 00:56:18,349
motherfuckin' file.

944
00:56:19,948 --> 00:56:23,783
I'm sure that, uh,
Agent Wilcox's name pops up

945
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:25,649
on a number of case files,
detective.

946
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:26,982
You should check with the DEA.

947
00:56:27,049 --> 00:56:29,182
They just sent me here.

948
00:56:29,248 --> 00:56:32,348
(Wilcox) 'Look, if I was involved
in the kind of pro-active operation'

949
00:56:32,414 --> 00:56:34,981
that you are suggesting,
I would be intimately acquainted

950
00:56:35,048 --> 00:56:38,782
with, uh, Peter,
what was his name again?

951
00:56:39,348 --> 00:56:40,481
Koslow.

952
00:56:40,548 --> 00:56:43,048
- Koslow.
- Hmm.

953
00:56:43,114 --> 00:56:46,914
Our organizations may not
see eye-to-eye, detective

954
00:56:46,981 --> 00:56:51,381
but we've extended you every
professional courtesy we can.

955
00:57:01,412 --> 00:57:04,945
There's Koslow
right after Gomez was killed.

956
00:57:07,012 --> 00:57:09,844
That Prius screamin',
"We're the FBI!"

957
00:57:09,911 --> 00:57:12,544
'That's y'all leaving
the scene.'

958
00:57:12,612 --> 00:57:15,978
And here, even though this
picture may be hard to read

959
00:57:16,043 --> 00:57:20,343
that person looks very much
like you, Agent Wilcox..

960
00:57:20,411 --> 00:57:23,144
...drivin' away
from the crime scene.

961
00:57:25,144 --> 00:57:26,577
You want to pitch
your field office

962
00:57:26,643 --> 00:57:29,976
against the biggest police
department in the world?

963
00:57:30,743 --> 00:57:32,143
Let's do it.

964
00:57:32,877 --> 00:57:35,109
We love us a good fight.

965
00:57:35,176 --> 00:57:37,109
[intense music]

966
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:40,976
Have a good day.

967
00:57:54,375 --> 00:57:56,909
[music continues]

968
00:58:04,807 --> 00:58:07,941
[thunder rumbling]

969
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:19,174
[music continues]

970
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:25,006
[rain pattering]

971
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:30,705
[sniffles]

972
00:58:32,871 --> 00:58:38,137
What perfume you wear?
Smells expensive.

973
00:58:38,204 --> 00:58:40,737
[chuckles]

974
00:58:42,037 --> 00:58:43,172
[sighs]

975
00:58:47,904 --> 00:58:51,036
[drone whirring]

976
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:54,303
[seagulls squawking]

977
00:58:56,035 --> 00:58:58,769
Alright. Now, get
this shit cleaned up.

978
00:58:58,836 --> 00:59:01,968
[dramatic music]

979
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,468
[indistinct chatter]

980
00:59:37,332 --> 00:59:39,732
(male #6)
'Okay, that's enough.'

981
00:59:54,331 --> 00:59:56,565
(Grens)
'It must be tough on you.'

982
00:59:56,632 --> 01:00:00,897
- We'll get through it.
- 'Like you did the last time?'

983
01:00:00,964 --> 01:00:03,130
I checked the old visitor logs
at Bale Hill.

984
01:00:03,197 --> 01:00:06,131
You and Anna never missed
a visitors' day.

985
01:00:06,198 --> 01:00:08,664
That's how
you kept him strong, huh?

986
01:00:08,731 --> 01:00:10,764
You let him see
how much he had to lose.

987
01:00:10,831 --> 01:00:13,696
[sighs]
What do you want?

988
01:00:13,763 --> 01:00:16,796
Someone killed a friend of mine.

989
01:00:16,862 --> 01:00:18,761
I used to think
your husband did it

990
01:00:18,829 --> 01:00:20,096
but now I'm not so sure.

991
01:00:20,162 --> 01:00:22,696
This FBI thing has gotten me
thinkin' otherwise.

992
01:00:22,761 --> 01:00:24,927
[chuckles]

993
01:00:24,994 --> 01:00:27,827
Look, I'm here
to help your husband.

994
01:00:27,895 --> 01:00:30,861
But you got to give me
something to work with.

995
01:00:30,928 --> 01:00:33,027
You know, five years ago
we walked into a bar

996
01:00:33,094 --> 01:00:36,194
looking for a jump start
for our car.

997
01:00:36,261 --> 01:00:38,960
Some bikers inside started
making comments about me

998
01:00:39,026 --> 01:00:41,960
so Pete asked them to stop

999
01:00:42,027 --> 01:00:44,161
and then he was fighting
three of them.

1000
01:00:45,693 --> 01:00:47,059
That night

1001
01:00:47,126 --> 01:00:49,792
I went from being the wife
of a great father

1002
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:53,760
and a loving husband
to the wife of a convict killer.

1003
01:00:53,827 --> 01:00:57,160
And since then,
every time someone tells us

1004
01:00:57,225 --> 01:00:58,826
they wanna help

1005
01:00:58,892 --> 01:01:01,359
they end up doing
the exact opposite.

1006
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:06,026
So unless you wanna
buy something..

1007
01:01:06,093 --> 01:01:09,792
With all due respect
to you and the NYPD

1008
01:01:09,859 --> 01:01:12,292
get the fuck out of my store.

1009
01:01:15,157 --> 01:01:18,224
I'm not like all the others,
Mrs. Koslow.

1010
01:01:19,924 --> 01:01:22,758
I hope you don't learn that
the hard way.

1011
01:01:28,956 --> 01:01:31,122
Stay safe out here.

1012
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:36,990
[indistinct chatter]

1013
01:01:38,323 --> 01:01:40,856
[intense music]

1014
01:01:44,555 --> 01:01:46,355
And here we go.

1015
01:01:48,687 --> 01:01:51,621
[indistinct chatter]

1016
01:01:51,688 --> 01:01:54,822
[music continues]

1017
01:02:00,687 --> 01:02:03,821
[indistinct chatter]

1018
01:02:29,484 --> 01:02:31,317
[cheering]

1019
01:02:48,151 --> 01:02:50,116
Let him through.

1020
01:02:53,949 --> 01:02:57,615
(Grens on phone) 'The Knicks
hardly get that exciting, huh?'

1021
01:02:57,682 --> 01:02:59,148
Who's this?

1022
01:02:59,215 --> 01:03:02,149
Motherfucker, I'm the hangman.

1023
01:03:02,215 --> 01:03:04,883
And I just put a tight noose
around your neck.

1024
01:03:06,214 --> 01:03:10,081
In a few hours, you're gonna be
alone on this yard

1025
01:03:10,148 --> 01:03:13,914
it'll be the scariest moment
of your life.

1026
01:03:13,981 --> 01:03:16,947
'Your only way out
is that man in front of you.'

1027
01:03:17,013 --> 01:03:19,613
'His name is Vermin.'

1028
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:22,779
'When you're ready to talk
about Officer Gomez's murder'

1029
01:03:22,846 --> 01:03:25,147
'tell Vermin
to call the hangman.'

1030
01:03:25,214 --> 01:03:28,147
[intense music]

1031
01:03:51,277 --> 01:03:54,211
[indistinct chatter]

1032
01:04:10,876 --> 01:04:14,009
[ominous music]

1033
01:04:15,809 --> 01:04:18,108
Here I am, dead man.

1034
01:04:18,174 --> 01:04:20,275
Present and fucking
accounted for.

1035
01:04:20,342 --> 01:04:22,476
We need to talk.

1036
01:04:22,543 --> 01:04:24,009
I got a fuckin' present for you.

1037
01:04:24,074 --> 01:04:26,208
Why're you selling fuckin'
product on my patch.

1038
01:04:27,508 --> 01:04:29,142
To get your attention.

1039
01:04:30,574 --> 01:04:33,973
You have it. I don't think
it's on you want.

1040
01:04:34,041 --> 01:04:35,774
Slewitt.

1041
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,974
That's for not respecting
the system.

1042
01:04:39,074 --> 01:04:41,508
That's for not following
our rules.

1043
01:04:41,573 --> 01:04:44,708
[grunting]

1044
01:04:47,705 --> 01:04:49,906
Smiley, listen,
listen, listen.

1045
01:04:49,973 --> 01:04:51,139
Please, listen!
You gotta listen to me.

1046
01:04:51,206 --> 01:04:52,572
I'm here to take out
The General.

1047
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:54,072
I'm here
to take out The General.

1048
01:04:54,139 --> 01:04:56,272
I need, I need his Bale Hill
distribution chain.

1049
01:04:56,338 --> 01:04:58,072
I need all the names.
I need all the names.

1050
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:01,106
I'll take him down.
I'll fucking help you..

1051
01:05:04,472 --> 01:05:06,705
Make it look like a suicide.

1052
01:05:06,772 --> 01:05:08,572
Clean up after you're done.

1053
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:11,772
[choking]

1054
01:05:19,537 --> 01:05:21,837
You think Mick is important?

1055
01:05:21,904 --> 01:05:25,503
Six Ki's of fentanyl per week.

1056
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:28,402

1057
01:05:28,469 --> 01:05:30,404
What are those names for?

1058
01:05:33,702 --> 01:05:36,336
[Peter gagging]

1059
01:05:36,402 --> 01:05:38,336
What are those names for?

1060
01:05:51,702 --> 01:05:54,267
I'm a... snitch.

1061
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:57,201
I'm a snitch.

1062
01:06:03,533 --> 01:06:05,999
Let him down.

1063
01:06:08,332 --> 01:06:09,999
[gasps]

1064
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:12,000
[coughs]

1065
01:06:13,899 --> 01:06:15,699
It's their fault, Ben.

1066

1069
01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:29,597
Are you alright, dead man?

1070
01:06:29,664 --> 01:06:31,365
You're a snitch?

1071
01:06:32,997 --> 01:06:35,830
I made a deal with the Feds
to take down The General.

1072
01:06:38,529 --> 01:06:41,164
Look, you're on top now.

1073
01:06:41,231 --> 01:06:43,963
But The General's coming for you
harder than ever.

1074
01:06:45,996 --> 01:06:48,563
If you gimme that list

1075
01:06:48,629 --> 01:06:50,929
I'll bury
that Polish cocksucker.

1076
01:06:53,629 --> 01:06:55,829
That's all, huh?

1077
01:07:03,861 --> 01:07:06,028
So, what's it gonna be?

1078
01:07:09,694 --> 01:07:11,995
If you're alive in three hours..

1079
01:07:13,993 --> 01:07:16,093
...you fuckin' own my ass.

1082
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:44,158
You can wait here.

1083
01:07:59,789 --> 01:08:01,957
Grens went to Bale Hill.

1084
01:08:02,024 --> 01:08:03,756
Shit.

1085
01:08:03,823 --> 01:08:05,323
- I'm sure Leonard blocked him.
- He did.

1086
01:08:05,390 --> 01:08:08,189
But it's only a matter of time
before he gets to Koslow.

1087
01:08:08,255 --> 01:08:10,889
He's already got Washington
on the fucking phone

1088
01:08:10,956 --> 01:08:13,856
asking me why an NYPD cop
is trying to subpoena a file

1089
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:16,389
on an FBI informant
who shouldn't exist.

1090
01:08:17,887 --> 01:08:19,987
Look, we just need
to stall a few days.

1091
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:23,055
Koslow is so close to delivering
and then it won't matter.

1092
01:08:25,387 --> 01:08:27,721
What? What are you thinking?

1093
01:08:28,755 --> 01:08:31,355
- Burn him.
- No.

1094
01:08:31,421 --> 01:08:33,953
He has a family, I mean,
we, you can't make this call.

1095
01:08:34,021 --> 01:08:35,921
The Bureau can't afford
the luxury

1096
01:08:35,988 --> 01:08:38,420
of your precious feelings
right now.

1097
01:08:38,486 --> 01:08:40,919
We looked him in the eyes.
We made him guarantees.

1098
01:08:40,986 --> 01:08:43,253
You took a convicted killer
out of prison

1099
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:45,220
you run him off the books
and you stuck him in a room

1100
01:08:45,286 --> 01:08:46,519
where a cop was murdered.

1101
01:08:46,586 --> 01:08:47,720
If you don't see how this is

1102
01:08:47,786 --> 01:08:49,286
about to blow the fuck up

1103
01:08:49,352 --> 01:08:51,085
and tear you apart with it..

1104
01:08:51,153 --> 01:08:53,620
...you're not the agent
I thought you were.

1105
01:08:53,686 --> 01:08:56,386
How fucking dare you?

1106
01:08:56,452 --> 01:08:58,818
I was operating
under your authority.

1107
01:08:58,886 --> 01:09:00,786
You will not throw me
under the fucking bus

1108
01:09:00,853 --> 01:09:02,151
if I don't burn an innocent man.

1109
01:09:02,218 --> 01:09:05,152
I don't have to throw you
under the bus.

1110
01:09:05,219 --> 01:09:08,152
I didn't know anything
about this operation.

1111
01:09:10,616 --> 01:09:12,384
You were trying
to impress a superior

1112
01:09:12,451 --> 01:09:14,084
and you went too far.

1113
01:09:15,583 --> 01:09:17,218
We'll make an example of you.

1114
01:09:19,017 --> 01:09:22,084
You will serve jail-time.
I guarantee it.

1115
01:09:32,115 --> 01:09:34,915
You know, I started
on this floor 23 years ago.

1116
01:09:34,982 --> 01:09:37,281
My desk was right there.

1117
01:09:41,248 --> 01:09:42,383
Burn him.

1118
01:09:43,449 --> 01:09:45,248
It's an order.

1119
01:09:54,746 --> 01:09:57,880

I had you, white boy.

1123
01:10:28,277 --> 01:10:31,710
Smiley Phelps
was right behind you.

1124
01:10:31,777 --> 01:10:34,112
Like a nigger angel.

1126
01:10:41,176 --> 01:10:42,276

Hey, warden?
I just wanna shake your hand.

1131
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:27,205
Come on, leave the warden alone.

1132
01:11:27,272 --> 01:11:28,673
Oh, no, it's okay.

1133
01:11:30,072 --> 01:11:31,905
I just wanna thank you
and congratulate you

1134
01:11:31,972 --> 01:11:34,304
for running this place
the right way.

1135
01:11:34,371 --> 01:11:36,006
I now request a solitary.

1136
01:11:37,805 --> 01:11:39,640
I can't do that, Pete.

1137
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:42,971
If you leave me out here,
I'm a fuckin' dead man.

1138
01:11:43,039 --> 01:11:45,705
I'm sorry, Pete,
they were very clear.

1139
01:11:45,772 --> 01:11:47,672
Who was clear?
Look, this wasn't the deal.

1140
01:11:47,738 --> 01:11:49,270
Just get Wilcox here right now.

1141
01:11:49,337 --> 01:11:50,870
Escort the inmate back
to his block.

1142
01:11:50,937 --> 01:11:53,771
- Yes, sir.
- Lenon, Lenon? Come back here.

1143

'Come on.'

Come on, guys.
Get off the phones.

1148
01:12:12,601 --> 01:12:14,735
Next in line. Six minutes.

[cellphone ringing]

1150
01:12:24,768 --> 01:12:27,235
- Wilcox.
- It's me.

1151

Hey, it's me.

1152
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,066
I did it.
I drew you the picture.

1153
01:12:36,401 --> 01:12:38,401
(Pete) 'Why aren't
you sayin' anything?'

1154
01:12:40,699 --> 01:12:42,732
I did what you told me,
and I drew the picture

1155
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,634
and now I need
to show it to you.

1156
01:12:45,934 --> 01:12:48,066
'I need to show it
to you right now.'

1157
01:12:53,098 --> 01:12:56,231
You promised you'd come see it.
You fuckin' promised.

Pete?

1169
01:13:56,159 --> 01:13:57,794
Are you okay?

1170
01:14:00,027 --> 01:14:03,326
The key, you gotta use it
right now.

1171
01:14:06,959 --> 01:14:07,959
Why?

1172
01:14:09,626 --> 01:14:11,627
They fucked me.

1173
01:14:13,458 --> 01:14:16,391
- I'm not gettin' out of this.
- 'No, no. You shut up.'

1174
01:14:16,457 --> 01:14:17,825
'You listen to me.'

1175
01:14:17,892 --> 01:14:21,025
There is a detective.
He, he asked about the dead cop.

1176
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:23,858
He knows about the FBI, okay?

1177
01:14:23,925 --> 01:14:27,090
'You don't fucking give up now.'

1178
01:14:27,157 --> 01:14:29,957
Okay. Alright.
Give him the tapes.

1179
01:14:30,024 --> 01:14:32,057
Tell him there's information
about Daniel Gomez.

1180
01:14:32,123 --> 01:14:33,491
He'll know what to do,
but you gotta

1181
01:14:33,556 --> 01:14:36,223
you gotta make him promise
to protect you too.

1182
01:14:36,290 --> 01:14:38,090
'You gotta do it right now.
You and Anna you ain't safe.'

the house right now.'

'Okay, baby. You gotta get
out of the house right now.'

1185
01:14:41,855 --> 01:14:44,656
Promise me.
Promise me right now, okay?

1186

We tracked you here.

1198

Now, you and Anna
need to get off the grid.

1199

You need to go somewhere
the Pols won't find you.

1200
01:17:06,344 --> 01:17:08,009

1201
