He never really stood a chance.

I didn't have to steal it.

What you left vulnerable,
I seized. I stole nothing.

46
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:08,720
You lacked vision, Weyland.
That was your undoing.

dilapidated prisons all around the globe?

50
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,338
Vision?

51
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,675
You're so far over your head, you might
as well be six feet under the ground.

52
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:33,412
The prison business is not what
made this company profitable.

53
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:35,280
So the conclusion to draw,

54
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,552

Let me show you what true
vision really looks like.

58
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,742
You started something
beautiful, Weyland.

59
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,811
But you only scratched at the surface.

00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:44,716
It's a man in a mask.

71
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:46,918
I could have 20 Frankensteins
around the globe.

72
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,021
How would the fans know
which one was real?

73
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,590
Frankenstein won his fourth race today.

74
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:54,760
One more win, he goes free.

75
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:57,462
That's a fact that every fan knows.

76
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:00,932
Now, if you suddenly change
the rules of the game,

77
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:03,068
you're going to lose your audience.

78
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,904
And if you're hoping
that Frankenstein loses,

79
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,874
well, son, I guess
there's a first time.

80

Now, how would your

82
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,982
That's why you're going to fail.
