1
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:47,506
Yeah, hon, I'll try
to get out of here.

2
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,242
You little putz.

3
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,177
Not you, hon.

4
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,279
What are you making?

5
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,483
Turkey giblet casserole?

6
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,651
'Oh, my god.'

7
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,287
'Jesus.'

8
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,866
I think that belongs
in the lost and found.

9
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,936
Uh, yeah. I was, I was
looking for the ID in there.

10
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,275
You know, I just
literally sent the report

11
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:33,445
to your parole officer
this morning.

12
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:35,647
I said good things about you.

13
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:40,219
'You finish off your shift
and you're done.'

14
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,323
make sure you empty
the trash bins.

15
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:57,636
Oi! Watch it, rugrats.
This is not a playground.

16
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,741
Sugar high.

17
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,509
'Eww. What happened
to your skin?'

18
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:06,378
hey, come here.

19
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,413
Why don't you get out of here,
you little shit?

20
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,317
- They're just kids.
- Bad breeding.

21
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,754
You look good.

22
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:22,794
Hey, the lockers were closed.
I saw your bag on the bleachers.

23
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,696
So I put my stuff in there.
Is it cool?

24
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:28,367
Cool. You coming in?
It's heated.

25
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:30,402
It's an upgrade
from what I remember.

26
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:32,671
The place remodeled.
A lot has changed.

27
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:35,407
Yeah.

28
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:48,320
Jonna, I'm glad you came.
It's been too long.

29
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:53,992
Well, you know, it was
either this or sit at home

30
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:56,061
and listen to mom bitch
about her stupid boyfriend.

31
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:57,696
What's his name again?
Phil or Steve?

32
00:04:57,698 --> 00:05:00,065
- Steve.
- Steve. Whatever.

33
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,804
So how long has it been?

34
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:09,341
Three months, two weeks
and 14 hours.

35
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:11,343
I'm proud of you.

36
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,579
To hell with this.

37
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,617
Remember sophomore year,
we use to bet

38
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:19,918
who could race around
the pool the fastest?

39
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,321
- Oh, come on, Bree.
- Come on.

40
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:23,955
Maybe you could break
another swimming record.

41
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:25,557
Loser buys dinner.

42
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,926
Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm
at minus five in the bank

43
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,828
so you're getting dinner
either way.

44
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,496
Deal.

45
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,806
'Come on, wimp.'

46
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,541
you know,
I'm gonna own you, right?

47
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:44,876
- Oh, yeah?
- So good on you.

48
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,923
Let's go, time to go.
We're closing up.

49
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:06,798
Ladies, we closing up.
You need to get out of the pool.

50
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,967
- You're open till 7:00.
- It's a holiday weekend.

51
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,937
You see all the signs
hanging up around here?

52
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:15,674
Some people need to learn
how to read.

53
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:18,110
Some people need to learn
how to kiss my ass.

54
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,686
There's something
I wanna show you.

55
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:29,154
Yeah?

56
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:30,756
Thank you all for coming.

57
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:32,891
Have a pleasant holiday weekend.

58
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,727
'The katea public pool
is now closed.'

59
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,596
- what are you looking for?
- My ring.

60
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:39,631
I, I had it right here.

61
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:42,401
- What ring?
- Just my ring.

62
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,105
Well, I mean, are you sure
you even brought it?

63
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:48,540
Maybe you left it at home
or something.

64
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:50,509
No, I'm positive.

65
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:56,148
- That means you too.
- One minute!

66
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:58,917
Let's go.

67
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,127
Hang on.

68
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,196
I think I can see
something down here.

69
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,228
- I don't see anything.
- Down by the hole right there.

70
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:21,139
Hey, how the hell
did you see that?

71
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,542
Well, I mean, is that it?

72
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:24,976
That's it.

73
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,820
Thank you very much for coming.

74
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,990
Have a good weekend.

75
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:44,162
Just get the hell out.

76
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:35,013
About damn time.

77
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,202
Are you okay?

78
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:07,706
Oh, god. Oh, god.

79
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,208
No, I'm not okay! I'm trapped
in a fucking pool, Bree!

80
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,011
We aren't trapped.

81
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:15,280
Shit, my ring's
still down there.

82
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,949
Oh, screw your damn ring.

83
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,784
I'm sure
someone's still out there.

84
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,720
- Hello?
- Hello!

85
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:23,622
- We're in the pool!
- 'We're in the pool!'

86
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:26,257
we're in here!
We're trapped in here!

87
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,126
'Hello!'

88
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,930
oh, god.

89
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,175
We're all alone.

90
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,378
Everyone's left.

91
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,413
No, they'll come back.

92
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:51,950
Are you dense? Everyone's left.

93
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:53,752
The pool's closed
for the holiday weekend.

94
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:56,388
We're stuck in here.
We're gonna die in here.

95
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,757
We're not gonna die.
Stop freaking out.

96
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:02,260
Oh.

97
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:05,163
God, I feel nauseous.

98
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,165
Hey, hey, hey,
calm down, calm down.

99
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,405
Remind me to knock out that
manager when we get out of here.

100
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:15,674
This is horseshit.

101
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:18,710
Oh, my god, that bastard
did it on purpose.

102
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:22,914
Shit! I cannot believe
this is happening!

103
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,450
- Help! Somebody, help us!
- Hey, hey, hey. Jonna.

104
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:27,719
- Jonna, come on, come on!
- God!

105
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:30,422
It's too solid.
We can't break it.

106
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:33,158
Oh. Oh.

107
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,826
We can, we can go
to the shallow end

108
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:36,227
and just try and push it up
from there, alright?

109
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:37,462
I don't know if it'll work

110
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:40,065
but we have to try
something, okay?

111
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:42,767
Yeah. Yeah, okay, let's go.

112
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,183
'On three.'

113
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:01,019
one, two, three!

114
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:05,757
Useless!

115
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,961
We had to try.
I needed to see how solid it is.

116
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:13,098
Solid? It's made
of freakin' fiberglass.

117
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,833
Listen, we need to figure out
our options here.

118
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:16,434
Are you serious?

119
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:18,870
You're going to treat this like
one of your corporate projects?

120
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:22,040
Do I get a review after?
Can I be the team leader?

121
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:24,943
What would you rather do?
Scream your head off some more?

122
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:26,978
Fine. What now?

123
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,781
We need to check
all the seals and edges.

124
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:32,183
Maybe there's a weak spot
somewhere.

125
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:35,019
- Yeah?
- Yeah, okay. Let's do it.

126
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,153
Yuck, gross.

127
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:34,846
'Hey, I found something.'

128
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,117
it's a hole.

129
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,256
It's thick. We need something

130
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:46,958
to push through,
so we can widen it.

131
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,459
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah,
okay, I'll just go

132
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,495
and grab my tool belt.

133
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,564
Get out of the way.

134
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:55,099
'Piece of shit!'

135
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:57,402
'come on! Ugh!'

136
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:01,139
real productive.

137
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:03,208
Why is there a hole, anyway?
A peephole?

138
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,109
Condensation hole or air duct,
I don't know.

139
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:07,979
Or maybe so people
don't get stuck?

140
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:09,414
Idiots.

141
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,617
Like I said, we need something.

142
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:14,886
I can't believe
this is happening.

143
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:18,389
Hey, just keep looking. Come on.

144
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,020
Well?

145
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:26,291
No use.

146
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:30,528
Just let me rest.
Think for a sec.

147
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,463
What do you think the worst way
to die would be?

148
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:34,332
'Quit being morbid.'

149
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:35,934
starvation?

150
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,704
- Drowning?
- Stop.

151
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:41,306
Sharks?

152
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:43,007
Probably being eaten alive
by sharks.

153
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:45,343
I mean, that's all
we're missing, right?

154
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:48,279
- David.
- What about him?

155
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,450
He proposed.
I was gonna tell you.

156
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,620
He'll figure this out.
He'll call the police

157
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:58,056
when he notices I'm gone.

158
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:00,024
It's been more
than an hour, Bree.

159
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:02,727
We just have to wait.

160
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:05,096
Right. Okay, yeah, alright.

161
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:09,334
I mean, let's just, uh

162
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:12,537
kick back and relax
and, uh, and wait

163
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:15,273
for your knight
in shining armor to ride in

164
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:18,409
on his, on his white horse
and rescue us.

165
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:20,678
What is wrong with you?

166
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,680
Nothing. Nothing at all.

167
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,121
This isn't my fault, you know?

168
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:32,190
Right, 'cause you're perfect.

169
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,661
Is that what this is about?

170
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,465
Do you think
rehab was easy for me?

171
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:43,067
Going through that
all over again?

172
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:45,470
- Jonna...
- Know what the worst part was?

173
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:52,310
It was coming home
to find you not there.

174
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,747
It sucked.

175
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:58,116
I'm sorry.

176
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:00,351
It's just
I have my own life now.

177
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,689
Can't you take care of yourself?

178
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:08,026
- Apparently, I can't.
- That's not what I meant.

179
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:09,660
No?

180
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:12,563
No, did you just mean
to, to rub it in a bit?

181
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:15,633
Just a little, you know,
brag about your..

182
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:18,236
Your giant diamond ring.

183
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:21,372
Tell me about how wonderful
your life is with David.

184
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,474
You've always been like that.

185
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:28,646
You did it, didn't you?

186
00:17:28,648 --> 00:17:31,516
You saw the ring in my bag
and you threw it in the water.

187
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:35,219
How could you, jonna?
Look what you've done to us!

188
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,554
Jesus!

189
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,728
Come on.

190
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:23,301
Ow! Shit!

191
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:29,674
Are you okay?

192
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:34,712
- Yeah, I'll survive.
- 'We can't keep fighting.'

193
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:36,781
we need to work together
and figure a way out.

194
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:39,851
Yeah, like that's possible.

195
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:41,719
The grate at the bottom,
I think it might be loose.

196
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:44,422
- Maybe we can pull it off.
- Yeah, and then?

197
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:46,624
It's heavy.

198
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:47,859
It might be able
to break the cover

199
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:49,827
if we can find the right spot.

200
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:53,397
Okay, great, Bree. Why don't
you try and pry it off then?

201
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:55,666
I did. It won't budge.
I'm not strong enough.

202
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,170
And what? You think I am?

203
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:02,440
Well, if we tried together
or, or we take turns.

204
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:04,242
Sounds crazy.

205
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:07,145
Look, if you're still scared
of getting your hair stuck...

206
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:10,414
I'm not scared, okay?

207
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,517
It just sounds pointless.

208
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,787
You have another idea?

209
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,692
Was that..

210
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,829
It came from outside the pool.

211
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,831
By the bleachers.

212
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,443
- It's David. It has to be.
- Lot a help that does us.

213
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:40,711
'Maybe we can get to it.'

214
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,253
here. Another air duct.

215
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:50,922
If we could just make it
big enough to get to the...

216
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:53,591
We already tried that, MacGyver.

217
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:56,327
Can you just think
one positive thing, please?

218
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:59,230
Yeah, okay, sure,
I'm positive this truly sucks.

219
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:01,966
Yeah, hey, it's me again.

220
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:03,801
Yeah, don't forget
I have that dinner tonight

221
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:06,337
so, uh, don't wait up.

222
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:08,472
Talk to you when I get home,
okay? Love you.

223
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:10,208
Yeah, bye.

224
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,517
- What are you doing now?
- 'Something useful.'

225
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,852
damn it!

226
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,819
Told you it was a stupid idea.

227
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:59,590
This whole day
has been a stupid idea.

228
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,393
Right. Who'd wanna hang out
with a screw-up like me, right?

229
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:07,265
Maybe you're right.

230
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:30,755
How long before
he starts to worry?

231
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:34,992
No idea.

232
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:37,895
Great.

233
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,701
What just happened?

234
00:21:43,703 --> 00:21:45,903
Must be on a timer.

235
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:47,338
Oh.

236
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:52,076
You got to be kidding me.
Come on!

237
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:05,356
He keeps calling.

238
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,960
He's gonna get worried.
He has to.

239
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:12,496
Yeah, and then what?

240
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:13,898
I don't know.

241
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,068
Nobody knows
we're down here, Bree

242
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:20,404
and when they find out,
it's gonna be too late.

243
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:23,541
Can we not argue about this
for, like, the 100th time?

244
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:29,513
I never liked him.

245
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,083
I don't understand why you
would agree to marry that chump.

246
00:22:32,085 --> 00:22:33,751
You're so much better than him.

247
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:35,920
Don't get started on David.

248
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:37,521
'It's so typical of you.'

249
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,056
you get in a hard spot
and you start digging

250
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:41,759
at everyone around you
until you strike a nerve.

251
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:43,627
I've had enough.

252
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:01,011
What is it?

253
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:02,613
A headache.

254
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,819
You can't lie to me.

255
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:11,455
'Your eyes are bugging out.
You can barely stand.'

256
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:16,160
my blood sugar's low.

257
00:23:16,162 --> 00:23:18,796
- 'I'm diabetic.'
- What?

258
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:23,901
'I need my shot.'

259
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,703
it's in my purse.

260
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,807
You're making this up, right?

261
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:31,142
Why would I?

262
00:23:31,144 --> 00:23:33,811
I don't know. Sympathy?

263
00:23:33,813 --> 00:23:35,479
That's a page out of your book.

264
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:36,914
Not everybody thinks
the way you do.

265
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,717
Oh, come on. Don't fuck with me.
That's not funny.

266
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,657
I'm not.
I was diagnosed three years ago.

267
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,494
Jesus.

268
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,999
Why, why didn't you t-tell me?

269
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,437
Would it have mattered?

270
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:06,076
I'm not a doctor, Bree.
What does this mean?

271
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:08,446
It means I need my shot soon.

272
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,681
Or?

273
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:13,951
- I could fall into a coma.
- Oh, Jesus.

274
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,493
Okay.

275
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:25,629
We're gonna get you
your shot, okay?

276
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:01,131
'Let me see.'

277
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:13,744
does it ever hurt?

278
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:17,648
I don't feel anything, actually.

279
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,683
It's like I'm dead there.

280
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:27,658
We never talked about it.

281
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,693
What's to talk about?

282
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:31,262
Are you serious?

283
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:36,600
I didn't see it like you did.

284
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:40,738
'I only remember it
after it was over.'

285
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,008
- don't.
- That smell.

286
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,643
It's like it never went away,

287
00:25:45,645 --> 00:25:47,645
you know,
I still smell it sometimes.

288
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:49,980
Just stop.

289
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:53,083
I wish I never looked in there.

290
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:55,886
God, his skin, it was all black

291
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:57,621
and flaking off like paper.

292
00:25:57,623 --> 00:25:59,590
Why are you still talking
about this?

293
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:01,892
I had a counselor
in rehab, Margaret.

294
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:04,795
She said I should talk
about this stuff.

295
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:07,765
She your mother now?

296
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:10,334
She's kind of a douche,
actually, with terrible teeth

297
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:12,870
but she's right.

298
00:26:12,872 --> 00:26:14,872
Tell me what happened.

299
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:21,245
You know what happened.

300
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:24,014
I know what mom told me
and I pieced together

301
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:25,916
the bits and pieces
you've told me over the years

302
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,985
but I don't know
the whole story.

303
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,323
Dad was a monster.
Plain and simple.

304
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:40,097
He came in that night drunk.

305
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,700
You could smell it off him.

306
00:26:42,702 --> 00:26:45,002
'Every time he breathed'

307
00:26:45,004 --> 00:26:48,772
it filled the room with that
rotten stench of whisky.

308
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,045
He lit a cigarette
and just passed out.

309
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:02,686
He must have fallen
against the pillow because..

310
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:04,928
'...because you could see
the fire started about there..'

311
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:09,693
right by his head.

312
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:12,229
'It started fanning out
like a circle.'

313
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:13,831
'just burning.'

314
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,735
he didn't scream or anything.

315
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:19,336
He was so damn drunk
he didn't even notice

316
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:21,338
he was burning to death.

317
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:26,276
I pulled at him.
Tried to wake him up.

318
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,048
Here we are.

319
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:33,083
It must have hurt so bad.

320
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,921
Not until after.

321
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:41,392
When it was happening, it was..

322
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:45,996
It was just like ice
sliding over my skin..

323
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:49,733
Numbing me.

324
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:55,005
It was like a release.

325
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:01,278
Oh, my god.

326
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,713
I told you someone would come.

327
00:28:02,715 --> 00:28:04,214
Come on, hurry!

328
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,117
Help! Help, we're in here!

329
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:43,253
Come on!

330
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:45,355
- 'Help!'
- 'Help, help us!'

331
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,060
what the hell are you two
doing in there?

332
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:52,096
We got trapped.
Can you let us out?

333
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:56,867
Yeah. Hang on a minute.

334
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:59,770
Oh, my god. Oh, my god!
Thank god you're here!

335
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:02,406
Oh, my god! We've been
trapped in here for hours.

336
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:04,875
'My sister's ring got caught
in the drain'

337
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:07,377
'and we tried to get it out
and that idiot manager'

338
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:09,246
'closed the top on us.'

339
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:15,886
it's so crazy that you're here.
I can't believe it!

340
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:17,187
What's your name?

341
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:28,232
- I'll be right back.
- Where, where is she going?

342
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:30,300
Maybe she's just gone to see
how to open the cover.

343
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,071
Okay, yeah, okay.

344
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:05,435
Never heard of two grown women

345
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:07,871
getting themselves
stuck in a pool before.

346
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:11,375
I know. We're idiots, right?

347
00:30:11,377 --> 00:30:14,478
My daughter did something
stupid like this once.

348
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,413
'She got her hand
caught in a drain'

349
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:19,583
'and I called the plumber
for like 100 bucks'

350
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:22,085
to come out and take
the whole damn thing apart.

351
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:25,589
Yeah.

352
00:30:25,591 --> 00:30:27,958
That wasn't even the stupidest
thing she ever did.

353
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,129
- So can you get us out?
- Yeah.

354
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:34,164
What's your name, honey?

355
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:37,100
Bree. My sister's jonna.

356
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:38,402
'What kind of new age names.'

357
00:30:38,404 --> 00:30:40,971
'are, are you even from here?'

358
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:43,273
uh..

359
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:45,142
Wh-what's with all
the questions?

360
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:47,978
Are you, are you
gonna let us out or not?

361
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:51,381
Be polite. I have your phone
and it's blinkin'.

362
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,585
Looks like it needs a password.

363
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:01,258
Are you, are you serious?

364
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,895
'Well, it might be important.'

365
00:31:04,897 --> 00:31:08,632
maybe somebody's looking for you
or worried about you.

366
00:31:08,634 --> 00:31:11,201
A-are you helping us?

367
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:14,004
Yes, I'm helping you.
That's why I need the password.

368
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:18,075
- Don't do it.
- She could call the police.

369
00:31:18,077 --> 00:31:20,043
'I just wanna get
the hell out of here.'

370
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,179
yeah, okay, fine.

371
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:24,114
'7397.'

372
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:31,288
uh, what-what's so funny?

373
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:34,625
'Well, Bree, you're like
a real cutie pie, huh?'

374
00:31:34,627 --> 00:31:38,662
you and the guy with the wavy,
gravy brown hair.

375
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:46,536
'There's a lot of missed calls
and texts.'

376
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:48,672
'i wonder who they're from?'

377
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:51,041
miss, please,
there's no reason to do this.

378
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:56,280
There's always a reason
for everything.

379
00:31:58,316 --> 00:31:59,983
'Yeah, hey, it's me again.'

380
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:01,451
'yeah, don't forget
I have that dinner tonight'

381
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:04,021
'so, uh, don't wait up.'

382
00:32:04,023 --> 00:32:06,924
'talk to you when I get home,
okay? Love you.'

383
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:08,458
'babe, where are you?'

384
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:12,229
'did your psycho sister
kidnap you or something?'

385
00:32:12,231 --> 00:32:14,298
'alright, call me, love you.'

386
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,934
'wow! Somebody's got drama.'

387
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:18,468
can you, please,
just call him back?

388
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:21,605
Quit being such a bitch!
Why are you doing this?

389
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:22,973
'Come on!'

390
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:26,176
wow. What a mouth on you.

391
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:28,512
No wonder why David thinks
you're a psycho.

392
00:32:28,514 --> 00:32:31,515
'Let's see if your sister
has any pictures of you.'

393
00:32:31,517 --> 00:32:35,986
'oh, yeah, I bet that's you
in the tattoo, isn't it?'

394
00:32:35,988 --> 00:32:38,288
I bet that's not even
your only one, is it?

395
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:41,291
Do you have a tramp stamp,
jonna?

396
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,593
Give the lucky boys
something to look at?

397
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:45,228
What is she doing?

398
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,431
I'm gonna kick
the living shit out of you!

399
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:50,534
Come on! What are you doing?
It's not funny!

400
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:53,370
'Simmer down. I don't think
you're gonna be doing anything.'

401
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,673
'here's the thing.'

402
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,345
it's really tough
in the real world, you know.

403
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:03,714
And I just got out of lockup,
like, nine months ago

404
00:33:03,716 --> 00:33:05,549
'and I, I can't get a real job'

405
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:08,986
'and, and even this stupid crap
job cut me back to part-time'

406
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:11,088
and that's why
I'm so behind on rent.

407
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,256
I..

408
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:16,159
All these stupid bills, I..

409
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:21,164
What does that mean?

410
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,699
'It means
this is an opportunity.'

411
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:25,302
'and if you see one
and you don't take it'

412
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:27,170
'then you're stupid.'

413
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:31,508
so I'm gonna need your pin code
for your bank card, Bree.

414
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,710
'God, you crazy bitch!'

415
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:37,080
yeah, an attitude like that

416
00:33:37,082 --> 00:33:39,783
is probably what got you here
in the first place.

417
00:33:39,785 --> 00:33:42,386
Look, I'm sure
we can figure this out.

418
00:33:42,388 --> 00:33:45,055
Just, just promise
you'll let us out of here.

419
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:47,124
Nope.

420
00:33:47,126 --> 00:33:49,693
I'm not promising you nothing
until you give me the code.

421
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:52,029
'Don't do it.'

422
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:53,563
'don't do it.'

423
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,071
'well?'

424
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:05,275
what's it gonna be?

425
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,214
Stubborn.

426
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,556
Things never end well
for stubborn girls.

427
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,199
Great.

428
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:31,535
Where did she go?

429
00:34:31,537 --> 00:34:33,270
'To hell, I hope.'

430
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:35,305
we have to cooperate.

431
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:37,207
No, we don't have
to do anything.

432
00:34:37,209 --> 00:34:39,142
You act like we have
a choice here.

433
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:40,444
She's blackmailing us.

434
00:34:40,446 --> 00:34:42,446
Do you have any other ideas?

435
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:48,218
We've waited it out
this long, okay?

436
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,220
What's few more hours?

437
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:52,222
Jonna, I don't think I can.

438
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:09,339
'You know, I used to be
just like you girls.'

439
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:11,408
'i was a fashion snob too.'

440
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:16,713
'yep, buying fancy outfits
to relax at the pool.'

441
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,217
just like you.

442
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:26,356
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

443
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:29,426
'I did nothing.'

444
00:35:29,428 --> 00:35:31,761
but you know, I hope you know

445
00:35:31,763 --> 00:35:34,498
it does get real nippy
here at night, you know.

446
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,635
The whole, like, desert air,
it's, it's chilly.

447
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,871
'It could, like, cut you
right to the bone.'

448
00:35:40,873 --> 00:35:44,875
do you have any idea
how much trouble you're in?

449
00:35:44,877 --> 00:35:47,844
I'm fine, actually.
I'm a little worried about you

450
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:51,181
'cause you really seem like the
string-bikini type, aren't you?

451
00:35:51,183 --> 00:35:53,650
What the hell is this freakshow
talking about?

452
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:58,622
The heater. She turned it off.

453
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:01,858
This isn't a joke!

454
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,528
You're going to kill us,
do you understand?

455
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:08,899
Yeah, I never said it was.

456
00:36:08,901 --> 00:36:11,401
But unless you think
you can get through the night

457
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:14,337
without freezing,
I suggest you hand over

458
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,573
the pin code for your atm.

459
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:22,245
Just promise
you'll let us out of here.

460
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:27,684
I swear on my father's grave.

461
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,586
God, she's lying!

462
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:34,925
- We don't have a choice.
- There's always a choice.

463
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,604
'It's 6530.'

464
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,744
see, that wasn't so bad.

465
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:58,548
I swear to god, lady,
if you're lying to us..

466
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,417
'Stay as warm
as you can in there.'

467
00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:02,252
oh, come on,
you have to come back.

468
00:37:02,254 --> 00:37:04,921
You're gonna kill us!

469
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:06,990
She'll be back. She has to.

470
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:11,528
Oh, god. I swear to god,
when I get my hands on her..

471
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:16,333
Hey, hey. Just come here.

472
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:17,734
- 'Come here.'
- I'm gonna kill her.

473
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,369
Just hold on.

474
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:41,925
'It's so quiet.'

475
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:46,963
peaceful.

476
00:37:49,001 --> 00:37:51,501
No wonder we used to come here
when we were kids.

477
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:01,411
Bree.

478
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:04,848
Bree.

479
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,284
I'm here.

480
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:09,286
Just hang in there, okay?

481
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:13,423
Has she come back?

482
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:19,896
She will.

483
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:24,067
I don't trust her.

484
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,939
When do you trust anyone?

485
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:32,676
I'm really not in the mood
for a lecture, okay?

486
00:38:32,678 --> 00:38:34,678
I don't have the energy
to give one.

487
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:46,756
We can't just sit here
and freeze to death.

488
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:48,758
We tried everything.

489
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:54,097
'No.'

490
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:58,101
the filter grate,
I never tried it.

491
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:02,105
Maybe I can get it off.

492
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:06,643
You'll be okay if I leave you
for, like, two minutes?

493
00:39:06,645 --> 00:39:08,078
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

494
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:12,849
Don't go anywhere.

495
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,521
Just stay there.

496
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,538
Bree?

497
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:11,975
Bree!

498
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,080
Bree.

499
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:18,882
Come on, Bree, wake up, wake up.

500
00:40:18,884 --> 00:40:21,584
Wake up, come on!

501
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:22,952
Oh, god, you scared
the crap out of me.

502
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:25,088
Are you okay?

503
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,856
Did you get it?

504
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,093
'I couldn't.'

505
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:33,430
I'm useless.

506
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,499
You tried.

507
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:39,502
'No.'

508
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:42,972
I'm a coward.

509
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:44,641
Don't say that.

510
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:50,747
God, this is all my fault.

511
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,851
God, I wish
I could take it back.

512
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:58,087
'Hey. Jonna, hey.'

513
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,124
we can't lose hope.

514
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:08,198
I wish I was more like you.

515
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,067
Hey.

516
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:13,970
You are.

517
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:18,141
You just don't believe it.

518
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,597
You're wasting energy.

519
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:43,132
I need to move.

520
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:45,568
It's the only thing
that keeps me warm.

521
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,140
So this counselor in rehab..

522
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,244
'...did she ever talk
about what happened?'

523
00:41:54,246 --> 00:41:56,613
stop.

524
00:41:56,615 --> 00:41:58,882
I thought we were supposed
to talk about these things.

525
00:41:58,884 --> 00:42:01,584
We're supposed to talk about it
doesn't mean that I want to.

526
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:08,024
Yeah, you mean only
when it's convenient for you.

527
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,959
Yeah, sure, whatever.

528
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:17,033
What are you really afraid of?

529
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,701
I don't know.

530
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,038
Yeah, you do.

531
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:28,011
You really wanna know?

532
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:31,014
Yeah.

533
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:34,751
Monsters.

534
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,925
They're everywhere.

535
00:42:41,927 --> 00:42:43,927
So what?

536
00:42:43,929 --> 00:42:46,262
'Suicide's the answer.'

537
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:49,165
you don't know what it's like.

538
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:52,068
It's like I have this..

539
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:55,138
Giant, black..

540
00:42:57,274 --> 00:42:59,309
'...ugly thing inside me.'

541
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,681
rumbling, just eating at me.

542
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:10,320
You don't have
to be afraid anymore.

543
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,123
'It's in the past.'

544
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:21,030
yeah, well, you gotta stop
eating Chinese food, okay?

545
00:43:21,032 --> 00:43:23,700
All those, those fortune cookies
are rotting your brain.

546
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:33,343
All those things dad did to us.

547
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:38,014
I'm sorry it lasted so long.

548
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:43,219
Hey, if he didn't die, it would
have kept going forever, so..

549
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:47,757
It didn't.

550
00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:50,093
He's still in my head.

551
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:55,365
All the time.

552
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:57,233
It gets better.

553
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,738
'He's gone.'

554
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,773
keep reminding yourself that.

555
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:18,321
What the..

556
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:21,391
'How long have you
been there for?'

557
00:44:21,393 --> 00:44:23,092
a while now.

558
00:44:23,094 --> 00:44:25,662
Sounds like you girls have been
through some stuff.

559
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:29,265
You think
that makes you special?

560
00:44:29,267 --> 00:44:30,867
'Alright, so you, you got
what you wanted.'

561
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:33,136
you gonna let us out
of here or not?

562
00:44:33,138 --> 00:44:34,437
Yeah, maybe
you should have mentioned

563
00:44:34,439 --> 00:44:36,939
you only had 80 bucks
in your account.

564
00:44:36,941 --> 00:44:39,375
'A lot of good
that's gonna do me.'

565
00:44:39,377 --> 00:44:41,711
god, are you joking?

566
00:44:43,881 --> 00:44:46,282
You swore
on your father's grave!

567
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:50,286
'Listen.'

568
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:54,457
my sister's really not
doing so well.

569
00:44:54,459 --> 00:44:57,360
'She needs her shot.
It's in her purse.'

570
00:44:57,362 --> 00:44:59,762
'she's diabetic,
do you understand?'

571
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:04,367
- 'she could die.'
- Yeah, right.

572
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:07,470
You will say anything
to get out of there right now.

573
00:45:07,472 --> 00:45:10,273
I'm not lying. I'm serious.

574
00:45:10,275 --> 00:45:12,742
Come on. You don't want blood
on your hands, do you?

575
00:45:12,744 --> 00:45:13,976
Oh, boo-hoo. Shut up.

576
00:45:13,978 --> 00:45:15,411
I'm borderline diabetic

577
00:45:15,413 --> 00:45:18,448
and my doctor says
I don't even need anything.

578
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:21,484
So maybe that's just
for lazy people.

579
00:45:21,486 --> 00:45:24,253
I have a different kind.

580
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:26,255
'Can you just let us out,
please?'

581
00:45:26,257 --> 00:45:28,124
you know, I don't really see why

582
00:45:28,126 --> 00:45:31,494
I'm expected to do you
any favors.

583
00:45:31,496 --> 00:45:35,098
I mean, this whole thing
just pisses me off, you know.

584
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,867
You put me in this position
'cause you're so stupid.

585
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:40,103
This is not our fault.

586
00:45:40,105 --> 00:45:43,506
- 'Don't give me that crap.'
- What do you want?

587
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:48,878
The world doesn't
owe you any favors

588
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,013
and neither do I.

589
00:45:51,015 --> 00:45:55,952
Come on, just open this cover
and let us out!

590
00:45:57,956 --> 00:46:01,057
You know what, come here.
Come over here.

591
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:10,900
'Can you hear me?'

592
00:46:10,902 --> 00:46:13,302
I might just leave you
both in there to die.

593
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:53,309
She's insane.

594
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:55,545
I told you she was.

595
00:46:55,547 --> 00:46:58,114
We can't reason
with someone like this.

596
00:46:58,116 --> 00:47:00,183
We need to figure out
another way.

597
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:12,595
What are you doing?

598
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:21,537
It's a little surprise.

599
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,516
I really don't think
this is a good idea.

600
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,521
Just trust me for once.

601
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:07,650
I'm so sorry.

602
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:11,387
'I don't know what to do.'

603
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:18,094
well, I told you, girls,
everything happens for a reason.

604
00:48:18,096 --> 00:48:20,029
'I really need to tell
you something, okay'

605
00:48:20,031 --> 00:48:21,364
'but I don't want
my sister to hear.'

606
00:48:21,366 --> 00:48:23,366
it can only be you, okay?

607
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:26,269
Go ahead.

608
00:48:26,271 --> 00:48:28,938
I, I..

609
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:33,609
Yeah. Okay. Come on.

610
00:48:37,515 --> 00:48:39,282
I-I-i can't even hear you.

611
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:50,927
Go fuck yourself!

612
00:49:08,578 --> 00:49:11,113
I got her!

613
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:12,715
I got her!

614
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:32,168
Stupid girl.

615
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:43,346
You don't listen to me,
you don't listen.

616
00:49:43,348 --> 00:49:46,382
'You never listen to me.
You wanna ignore me?'

617
00:49:46,384 --> 00:49:48,651
serves you right.

618
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:50,286
You think this is funny?

619
00:49:50,288 --> 00:49:51,554
You got what you've deserved.

620
00:49:51,556 --> 00:49:53,556
Now you're gonna let us
out of here!

621
00:49:53,558 --> 00:49:57,526
You are messing
with the wrong woman.

622
00:49:57,528 --> 00:50:00,296
'And I'm sorry, Bree, but I'm
sure this ain't the first time'

623
00:50:00,298 --> 00:50:02,732
'you're gonna get punished
for something your sister did.'

624
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:11,607
well, this is for you.

625
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:26,422
- You smell that?
- Chlorine.

626
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,699
Shoot.

627
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:40,636
It must be the cleaning system.

628
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:45,708
Block the jets!

629
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:55,484
Oh!

630
00:51:22,246 --> 00:51:25,181
You have anything
you wanna say to me now?

631
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:04,553
You had enough yet, girls?

632
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:09,492
The hole.

633
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:11,827
The hole.

634
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,504
Let us out!

635
00:52:21,506 --> 00:52:23,772
What's that?
I can't really hear you.

636
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:28,410
Come on, please.

637
00:52:28,412 --> 00:52:30,713
It's, you're killing us!

638
00:52:30,715 --> 00:52:34,350
Please!

639
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:06,615
I can flip that switch
at any time, ladies.

640
00:53:06,617 --> 00:53:09,351
You understand? You hear me?

641
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,254
Yes.

642
00:53:12,256 --> 00:53:13,923
Speak up.

643
00:53:13,925 --> 00:53:17,193
'We understand.
Can you please just let us out?'

644
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:22,231
I'm the one in control here now.

645
00:53:22,233 --> 00:53:24,333
We're sorry.

646
00:53:24,335 --> 00:53:29,205
And all these life lessons,
they're not free.

647
00:53:29,207 --> 00:53:30,906
'You have something I want.'

648
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:34,210
you already have everything.

649
00:53:34,212 --> 00:53:37,613
You, you have my phone,
my purse.

650
00:53:37,615 --> 00:53:39,615
'What else do you want?'

651
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:42,785
I want that ring.

652
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:47,690
No, that's her engagement ring.
She's getting married.

653
00:53:47,692 --> 00:53:50,726
Let me tell you
something about marriage.

654
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:52,728
It's overrated.

655
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,763
That's not right.

656
00:53:54,765 --> 00:53:57,833
You're gonna thank me
in a couple of years. Trust me.

657
00:53:57,835 --> 00:54:01,837
I am, I am honestly,
I am begging you. Please!

658
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:04,607
Oh, you can't throw into it.
Bree, please.

659
00:54:04,609 --> 00:54:07,476
Please, I'm begging you.
I'm begging you, Bree.

660
00:54:07,478 --> 00:54:09,612
I just wanna go home.

661
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:14,516
Bree.

662
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:32,668
'Pawn shop will give me
something decent for this.'

663
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:38,507
I'm sure you feel pretty low,
but trust me

664
00:54:38,509 --> 00:54:40,776
there's always somebody
lower than you.

665
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:43,646
Can you let us out now?

666
00:54:43,648 --> 00:54:45,781
I'll let you out
when I'm good and ready.

667
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:51,387
I'm so sorry.

668
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,291
I don't wanna talk.

669
00:54:57,594 --> 00:54:58,994
Bree.

670
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,699
I just wanna be alone.

671
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:07,429
Jonna!

672
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:10,065
Is that you?

673
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:31,787
Miss, is that you?

674
00:56:34,792 --> 00:56:38,494
It's people. It's-it's people.

675
00:56:38,496 --> 00:56:39,995
People..

676
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:44,733
Here! We're in here!

677
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:54,009
Baby, it's, it's okay.

678
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:57,012
'You're safe.'

679
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:07,923
it's okay.

680
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:09,725
You're safe, baby.

681
00:57:11,561 --> 00:57:13,462
Where's jonna?

682
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:21,136
Baby, you can't leave her.

683
00:57:21,138 --> 00:57:22,938
I'm so tired.

684
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,740
She needs you.

685
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:31,046
I can't, I can't do it.

686
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:35,884
Jonna.

687
00:57:43,193 --> 00:57:44,726
Jonna?

688
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:57,506
What are you doing?

689
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,710
Just leave it alone.

690
00:58:01,712 --> 00:58:04,079
Jonna, you can't
break on me now.

691
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:07,716
We're gonna survive this.

692
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:13,222
What if we do?

693
00:58:13,224 --> 00:58:17,059
You survive this
and you, you have David.

694
00:58:17,061 --> 00:58:21,563
You have your life
to go back to, okay?

695
00:58:21,565 --> 00:58:23,932
There's nothing out there
for me.

696
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:28,637
I die
and no one will even notice.

697
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,675
It'll be a relief for you
and for mom and for everyone.

698
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:36,512
That's not true.

699
00:58:36,514 --> 00:58:38,514
That is not true.

700
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:43,886
I need you here, please.

701
00:58:43,888 --> 00:58:47,523
Oh, Bree, I don't want you
to have to carry me anymore.

702
00:58:49,292 --> 00:58:52,127
Jonna, we're sisters.
We carry each other.

703
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,197
Oh, fuck.

704
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:57,199
You'd really just leave me here?

705
00:58:57,201 --> 00:58:58,934
No.

706
00:58:58,936 --> 00:59:01,603
You kill yourself,
you kill both of us

707
00:59:01,605 --> 00:59:03,539
and I'm not ready to die.

708
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:05,874
And neither are you.

709
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:08,076
I wanna hear you say
you're gonna make it.

710
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:12,180
Jonna, I wanna hear you say it.

711
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,883
Okay.

712
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,287
I'm gonna make it.

713
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:22,758
Bree, I'm gonna make it.

714
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:26,194
I'm so sorry.

715
00:59:26,196 --> 00:59:27,930
You don't have to feel sorry.

716
00:59:27,932 --> 00:59:31,567
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it's not your fault.

717
00:59:31,569 --> 00:59:34,069
I'm so sorry for everything.

718
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:10,672
'Babe, where are you?
It's late. I just got home.'

719
01:00:10,674 --> 01:00:11,974
'you should have been
back hours ago.'

720
01:00:11,976 --> 01:00:14,743
'i called jonna, your mom.'

721
01:00:14,745 --> 01:00:16,612
'where are you?'

722
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:20,616
'Bree, I'm calling the cops.
This isn't like you.'

723
01:00:20,618 --> 01:00:22,651
'if you get this,
call me back right away.'

724
01:00:22,653 --> 01:00:25,354
'if I don't hear back in five,
I'm dialing 911.'

725
01:00:25,356 --> 01:00:27,222
'okay, I'm serious.'

726
01:00:28,992 --> 01:00:30,292
'Bree.'

727
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:50,345
god, when we get out of here

728
01:00:50,347 --> 01:00:54,316
I'm gonna eat
the entire Thanksgiving Turkey

729
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:56,051
all by myself.

730
01:00:57,887 --> 01:01:00,022
Well, here, give me your hand.

731
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:04,926
We need to figure out
what to say to her

732
01:01:04,928 --> 01:01:07,396
when she comes back.

733
01:01:07,398 --> 01:01:09,364
Well, if she comes back.

734
01:01:09,366 --> 01:01:10,699
She will.

735
01:01:10,701 --> 01:01:12,134
People like her
need people like us

736
01:01:12,136 --> 01:01:14,803
to feel good about themselves.

737
01:01:14,805 --> 01:01:17,439
Yeah, like a psycho version
of nurse ratched.

738
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:24,413
When she comes back,
you follow my lead, alright?

739
01:01:24,415 --> 01:01:26,314
I will. I promise.

740
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:31,153
Miss?

741
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:34,690
Yeah, it's me.

742
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:40,195
Thank you for coming back.

743
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:46,034
I'm not one of those monsters
you keep talking about.

744
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:48,770
No, you're not.
We know that now.

745
01:01:48,772 --> 01:01:50,939
- 'Really?'
- Yeah.

746
01:01:50,941 --> 01:01:53,742
'We've had a long time to talk
since we've been down here.'

747
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:58,013
'we get it now.'

748
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:01,349
at first, it seemed
like an accident

749
01:02:01,351 --> 01:02:04,319
but we know
it happened for a reason.

750
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:09,057
Go on.

751
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:10,926
'There are a lot of things
we've done in our lives'

752
01:02:10,928 --> 01:02:13,428
that were, that were wrong.

753
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:19,401
Right, jonna?

754
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:22,504
Right.

755
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:27,509
Being down here has given us
a lot of time to think.

756
01:02:30,847 --> 01:02:32,914
'And when you let us out
of here, we're gonna change'

757
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:35,417
a lot of things, we promise.

758
01:02:38,287 --> 01:02:40,355
'I'm really sorry
for everything.'

759
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:49,231
you know, I used to be
just like you.

760
01:02:49,233 --> 01:02:51,199
I used to have everything.

761
01:02:53,803 --> 01:02:56,204
And then it can all go away
in, like, one second.

762
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:01,109
So you better appreciate
each other.

763
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:06,481
We do.

764
01:03:09,018 --> 01:03:10,519
I'm gonna hit the code now.

765
01:03:10,521 --> 01:03:12,821
And when this cover opens,
I'm not gonna be here..

766
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,358
'...and I don't wanna ever see
you two around here again.'

767
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:19,227
- 'do you get that?'
- Yeah. We understand.

768
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:24,332
Okay, we just break this whole
thing off to a lesson learned.

769
01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:26,134
That's all it was.

770
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:49,157
Open!

771
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:54,496
Fuck!

772
01:03:57,433 --> 01:03:59,367
Come on. Come on.

773
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:22,457
What's taking so long?

774
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:30,632
I got a problem.

775
01:04:30,634 --> 01:04:33,902
- What?
- 'The code's not working.'

776
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:39,007
you said you were gonna
let us out.

777
01:04:39,009 --> 01:04:42,310
I was gonna let you out,
but he gave me the code

778
01:04:42,312 --> 01:04:45,113
the manager, like a month ago
in case I needed it

779
01:04:45,115 --> 01:04:47,349
and-and now it's not working.

780
01:04:58,594 --> 01:05:00,962
What are we supposed to do now?

781
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,901
I think you're on your own now.

782
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:11,139
Come on,
you can't leave us here.

783
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:13,208
You'll kill us.

784
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:17,245
I was gonna let you out.
I-it's not my fault.

785
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:21,316
Come on, please.

786
01:05:23,185 --> 01:05:25,921
Come on, let us out. Please!

787
01:05:25,923 --> 01:05:28,356
Call the police, do something.
They'll find us.

788
01:05:28,358 --> 01:05:30,091
No.

789
01:05:30,093 --> 01:05:32,661
Then the cops know about me,
I-i-i can't.

790
01:05:32,663 --> 01:05:35,931
No, they won't. Honestly,
we-we're not gonna say anything.

791
01:05:35,933 --> 01:05:38,967
'We swear to god.
Please. Please.'

792
01:05:38,969 --> 01:05:41,202
I can't go back to jail.
I can't do it.

793
01:05:41,204 --> 01:05:42,470
I'm not calling the cops.

794
01:05:42,472 --> 01:05:44,339
It almost killed me
the first time.

795
01:05:44,341 --> 01:05:46,675
It's not too late.
Come on, let us out.

796
01:05:46,677 --> 01:05:48,176
'If you're gonna
leave us down here'

797
01:05:48,178 --> 01:05:50,378
'you're gonna fucking kill us!
Please!'

798
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:53,481
come on! Let us out!

799
01:05:53,483 --> 01:05:58,486
God! Uh! Come on, please,
let us out.

800
01:05:58,488 --> 01:06:01,990
Come on. Come on!

801
01:06:01,992 --> 01:06:04,259
'Please! Stop!'

802
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:11,533
she left.

803
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:15,603
She left.

804
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:19,140
She left us.

805
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:15,563
Bree?

806
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:18,533
Bree!

807
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:32,047
Bree! Bree, Bree.

808
01:07:32,049 --> 01:07:34,382
Bree, Bree, Bree, Bree.

809
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:37,652
Bree, Bree, Bree.

810
01:07:37,654 --> 01:07:40,722
Oh, god. Gosh, you scared
the crap out of me.

811
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:45,360
I don't think I can make it.

812
01:07:45,362 --> 01:07:46,461
Oh, don't talk like that.

813
01:07:48,331 --> 01:07:49,464
It's okay. It's okay.

814
01:07:49,466 --> 01:07:52,300
Well, I lied to you.

815
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,403
What?

816
01:07:57,206 --> 01:07:59,240
I have a confession.

817
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:02,510
Tell me, please.

818
01:08:04,513 --> 01:08:06,381
Jonna, I'm so sorry.

819
01:08:06,383 --> 01:08:07,615
If I knew he was coming to you

820
01:08:07,617 --> 01:08:10,285
I would have done
something sooner.

821
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:16,491
I saw him go in your room

822
01:08:16,493 --> 01:08:18,293
and I knew.

823
01:08:20,596 --> 01:08:22,697
That night when the fire started

824
01:08:22,699 --> 01:08:24,632
it all happened so fast.

825
01:08:24,634 --> 01:08:28,103
It just caught up.
It started burning.

826
01:08:28,105 --> 01:08:31,172
He tried to get up,
but I held him down.

827
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:36,277
I held him back
until he stopped moving.

828
01:08:40,516 --> 01:08:43,384
Until I knew he wouldn't go
into your room again.

829
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:51,226
I killed the monster.

830
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:58,867
Come on.

831
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:05,473
Come on.

832
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:40,408
It's my turn to carry you now.

833
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:14,936
I need this, okay?

834
01:12:13,463 --> 01:12:15,697
God. Fuck!

835
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:13,721
No, no, no, no, no.

836
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:15,823
No. No, don't you die on me.

837
01:13:15,825 --> 01:13:18,426
No. Hey, hey.

838
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:25,533
Come on, I got the grate.
We're getting out of here.

839
01:13:25,535 --> 01:13:26,868
Come on.

840
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:29,504
Bree.

841
01:13:30,773 --> 01:13:32,940
Wake your ass up!

842
01:13:33,976 --> 01:13:36,711
Wake your ass up! Come on!

843
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:47,889
Okay, okay.
I need you to hold on.

844
01:13:47,891 --> 01:13:50,892
I need you to hold on
for me, Bree.

845
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:19,053
Fuck!

846
01:14:48,016 --> 01:14:51,752
Okay, come on. Finally.

847
01:14:51,754 --> 01:14:53,154
Come on.

848
01:14:53,156 --> 01:14:57,124
Oh. Come on, Bree. We're out.

849
01:14:57,126 --> 01:14:59,260
Come on. Okay.

850
01:14:59,262 --> 01:15:02,730
Bree. Ah, Bree, we made it.

851
01:15:02,732 --> 01:15:06,167
Come on. Hey. Hey.

852
01:15:06,169 --> 01:15:09,637
Come on. Come on, Bree,
it's fine, baby.

853
01:15:09,639 --> 01:15:13,674
Please. Please. Come on,
I need you to breathe now.

854
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:15,877
Hey, come on.

855
01:15:15,879 --> 01:15:18,646
Hey, we're so close.
Come on now, Bree. Come on.

856
01:15:18,648 --> 01:15:20,748
Oh, god.

857
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:22,984
Oh, fuck. Oh, god.

858
01:15:22,986 --> 01:15:26,521
'Uh, oh, stay here.'

859
01:15:32,728 --> 01:15:33,895
'god.'

860
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:37,098
what am I doing?

861
01:15:44,574 --> 01:15:47,775
Come on. Hey, hey, hey.

862
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:53,080
I love you, Bree.

863
01:15:53,082 --> 01:15:57,752
Come on. Breathe, baby, please.

864
01:15:57,754 --> 01:16:00,154
Come on! Come on.

865
01:16:03,091 --> 01:16:05,593
Come on, open those eyes.

866
01:16:05,595 --> 01:16:07,628
'Come on, do this.'

867
01:16:07,630 --> 01:16:09,830
you're not gonna die.

868
01:16:09,832 --> 01:16:11,832
Come on, baby.

869
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:16,103
<i>Bree.</i>

870
01:16:22,678 --> 01:16:26,614
Come on, Bree. You can do it.

871
01:16:26,616 --> 01:16:29,216
'Come on, baby. Hey.'

872
01:16:30,652 --> 01:16:32,687
there she is.

873
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,626
Oh, my god.

874
01:16:38,628 --> 01:16:41,195
There you go. Come on.

875
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,874
What are you doing?

876
01:16:53,876 --> 01:16:56,196
I had a feeling you were gonna
get yourselves out of there.

877
01:16:58,981 --> 01:17:01,682
You just got that fighting
spirit in you, don't you?

878
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:06,854
- Just like my little girl.
- Why?

879
01:17:06,856 --> 01:17:09,190
No. Just shut up!

880
01:17:09,192 --> 01:17:11,726
Maybe there is no reason.

881
01:17:11,728 --> 01:17:13,761
What are you gonna do?

882
01:17:16,231 --> 01:17:20,334
I shouldn't have done what
I did, but it's too late now.

883
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:25,306
I, I made it all the way
to the car

884
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:28,876
and I, I couldn't stop
thinking about you girls

885
01:17:28,878 --> 01:17:32,113
and, and what was gonna happen
if you didn't die in there.

886
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:36,217
What was gonna happen to me?

887
01:17:38,253 --> 01:17:40,655
Just listen to me, okay?

888
01:17:40,657 --> 01:17:43,324
Okay, you have lost so much.

889
01:17:43,326 --> 01:17:45,159
We all have.

890
01:17:45,161 --> 01:17:47,995
But please, please,
listen to me.

891
01:17:47,997 --> 01:17:49,864
Don't let me lose
my sister, okay?

892
01:17:49,866 --> 01:17:53,267
She's, she's the only thing
I have left in this entire life.

893
01:17:53,269 --> 01:17:55,136
- Please.
- I'm sorry.

894
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:06,013
Oh, no. Don't.

895
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:45,086
Help.
We're at the katea public pool.

896
01:18:45,088 --> 01:18:48,956
My sister, she's dying.

897
01:18:48,958 --> 01:18:50,458
Please hurry.

898
01:19:03,505 --> 01:19:05,239
Just go.

899
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:07,241
Get, get out of here.

900
01:19:10,879 --> 01:19:12,947
Go.

901
01:19:27,496 --> 01:19:29,930
Bree.

902
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:31,999
Bree.

903
01:19:32,001 --> 01:19:33,534
Bree.

904
01:19:41,042 --> 01:19:42,877
This is real?

905
01:19:45,046 --> 01:19:46,313
It's real.

906
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:51,385
You did it.

907
01:19:51,387 --> 01:19:52,953
We did it.

908
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,791
I never doubted you.

909
01:20:03,064 --> 01:20:05,065
I guess we're even.

910
01:20:07,335 --> 01:20:08,936
Not yet.

911
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:27,288
How?

912
01:20:31,259 --> 01:20:33,427
We killed the monster.
