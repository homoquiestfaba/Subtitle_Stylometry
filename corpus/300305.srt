1
00:00:58,558 --> 00:00:59,684
Over here, Mr. Addison.

2
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:29,417
-Any sign of Geiger?
-No, sir.

3
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:39,591
Keep looking.
He's out there. Somewhere.

4
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,041
What the hell?

5
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:06,803
Jesus!

6
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,241
-Slow down!
-l can't!

7
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,330
We're clear, Geiger.

8
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,063
Stand back.

9
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:22,517
-Mind over matter, baby.
-Loose cash only. Go!

10
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,280
Right.

11
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:29,352
-Elias!
-Hands up! Don't move!

12
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:34,024
-l said hands up!
-So you did.

13
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,266
Elias!

14
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,070
-Adrian, get in!
-We can't leave him here!

15
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,408
There's no time. Adrian, he's dead.
Come on!

16
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:59,984
Martin Elias. Been a prime suspect
on our watch list since 1977.

17
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:04,122
-Ancient history, Mr. Addison.
-Well, it was. Until this morning.

18
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,995
Elias was shot robbing
an armored car in Los Angeles.

19
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:11,533
He's currently in LAPD custody
undergoing surgery.

20
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:16,433
A division that's been closed down
for more than 20 years.

21
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,043
There's still fallout, sir.

22
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:20,042
We believe Elias is a part of
a larger group.

23
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,205
Possibly rogue. Headed by this man,
Adrian Geiger.

24
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,385
Also on the list, and probably
the most dangerous.

25
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,386
Look, the 70's are over,
Mr. Addison.

26
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:34,551
We're a little too busy tracking
down black market nukes to worry...

27
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:38,092
about all things Roswell,
if you catch my drift.

28
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,094
-Sir. Sir?
-What is it?

29
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:46,403
lf these people become active...

30
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,235
they can pose a threat
more dangerous.

31
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,635
And we believe this Elias
is a key to finding them.

32
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:55,910
Weren't you supposed
to retire last year, Ray?

33
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,313
l like to finish
what l start, sir.

34
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:00,713
Well, maybe it's time
to finish. Period.

35
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,490
He didn't believe you,
did he?

36
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:14,291
We need someone
to infiltrate them.

37
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,632
Somebody on the inside.

38
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,597
An expert
in this particular field.

39
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,419
Friction. Friction is the enemy
of all motion.

40
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,320
No matter where we move, friction
is pulling us the other way.

41
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:44,820
We move right, it pulls us left.
Forward, pulls us back. Questions?

42
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,231
-This is a physics class, right?
-Right.

43
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:50,631
That's why nature gave us friction
to stop things from moving.

44
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,265
Like you.

45
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,426
You call that a lecture?

46
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:20,692
What's next, illegal street races
to demonstrate acceleration?

47
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:24,232
-That's not a bad idea.
-l didn't know you were a runner.

48
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:30,674
No? Maybe you could
run over to my place later.

49
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,973
Teach me more about friction.

50
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:39,779
l miss you.

51
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:46,787
People don't stop seeing each
other when it's going so great.

52
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,520
We were great,
you know?

53
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:53,465
l know.

54
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:56,560
lt's not you.

55
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,195
Then what is it?

56
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:00,437
lt's me. l...

57
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:03,900
l can't...

58
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:10,104
You can't? What?

59
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:16,653
Well, l can.

60
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,657
So watch your step.

61
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:38,801
Hi, Sarah. How are you?

62
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,656
Will that be all, sir?

63
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,331
''Sir'' my ass, bitch!
You think l'm stupid?

64
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:41,801
-You know that guy!
-Take it all. Whatever you want.

65
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:45,603
l told you what l want! l want you
to open that fucking ATM machine!

66
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:49,436
-l can't! lt's not ours!
-Open it, bitch!

67
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,348
Put your hands up!

68
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:00,124
And put it on the end of this gun!
Put it on there!

69
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:04,455
l'm gonna give you 3 seconds!

70
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,129
Hey! Look at me!

71
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,463
One!

72
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,066
Two!

73
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:20,371
Look at me! Look at me when
l blow your fucking head off!

74
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,278
-Three!
-No!

75
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:47,167
Professor,
did you see that?

76
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,537
l wasn't here.

77
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,909
Professor, where are you going?
We have to call the police!

78
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,733
lt's black.
lt's a flip-phone.

79
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,808
lt's got a little blue trim
around the edge. Check, please?

80
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,206
Now, there's something
you don't see everyday.

81
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,215
Are you guys FBl?

82
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,958
Yeah. Agents Ripps and Mclntyre.

83
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:45,297
lt says here you lost control of
vehicle right before the robbery.

84
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:49,828
l didn't lose control of nothing.
l'm the best driver they've got.

85
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:53,603
They made me write that
for the insurance.

86
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,069
So what happened out here,
Earl?

87
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,403
This is off the record.

88
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,406
First l thought
we hit something.

89
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:06,907
And then, well, the truck
just started driving itself.

90
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,679
-Driving itself?
-You mean the gas pedal got stuck?

91
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:14,087
No, l mean, after we stopped,
it started going sideways.

92
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,588
Like...

93
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:17,659
Frogger.

94
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:21,161
The arcade game.

95
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:25,033
We were going sideways
like a crab.

96
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,236
What's with this guy
and shellfish?

97
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,648
A frog's an amphibian.

98
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:43,817
Damn thing had
a mind of its own.

99
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:50,351
A truck with a mind of its own.
That's a new one.

100
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:53,855
Just don't tell my wife.
Bad enough she wants GPS.

101
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:56,826
You're gonna think l'm nuts.

102
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,427
You drink lime juice for breakfast.
How much worse can it get?

103
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,967
But l actually believe him.
Sounds like sabotage.

104
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:06,600
They followed the truck, flipped it
somehow, then hit it.

105
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,879
How do you flip
a seven-ton truck?

106
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:09,912
Beats me.

107
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:18,851
Homeless guy confirmed the truck
flipped and that Elvis was driving.

108
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,152
ldeal spot. Light traffic.
cuts down on witnesses.

109
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,722
Security camera?

110
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,491
Out of commission.

111
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,501
Agent Ripps?

112
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,266
Real sorry l didn't recognize you
before. Would you mind?

113
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:44,473
You look different than on TV.
Better, l mean.

114
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,650
Oh, for Christ's Sake...

115
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,683
Any word on our suspect?

116
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,552
You mean Elias? He's at St. Mary's.
Recovery room 320.

117
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:56,154
Should l call ahead and let them
know you're on your way?

118
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,659
-That would be great.
-Sure. Sure thing.

119
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:03,632
Jordan.

120
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:11,300
-You should get your own website.
-Don't start, Frank.

121
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:14,276
No, seriously. We could post
likes and dislikes...

122
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:17,605
photos, favorite hiking trails...

123
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,290
Coming up next, details
on the mysterious armored...

124
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,625
car robbery in South Central
Los Angeles this morning.

125
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:10,263
Police and FBl are still
on the scene at this hour...

126
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,768
and we will bring you
a live update in 30 seconds.

127
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:22,508
Let me guess.
Spring cleaning?

128
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,677
l heard you missed first class,
so l figured you were probably...

129
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:30,180
What's going on?

130
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,225
Something's come up
. l'm leaving.

131
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:38,194
What do you mean?
For good?

132
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,995
You can't be serious.
l mean, what about your classes?

133
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,830
The semester doesn't even end
for another 2 weeks.

134
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,766
Yeah, l talked to the Dean.
Someone's gonna fill in for me.

135
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:57,944
The kids. You're the main reason
half of them are in the program.

136
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,711
-When were you gonna tell them?
-Before l left.

137
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,452
When were you gonna tell me?

138
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,189
l was gonna call you.

139
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,057
Don't.

140
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,766
Obviously l was just
fooling myself...

141
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:21,634
thinking that
we were anything.

142
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,570
l'll tell them you say goodbye.

143
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,246
Brooke...

144
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:30,306
wait.

145
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:32,211
Wait for what, huh?

146
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,177
For the past year l've been trying
to get you to open up to me...

147
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,517
for you to tell me something.
Anything about yourself.

148
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,454
And you know what? The only thing
l really know is...

149
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,388
that l don't really
know you at all.

150
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,106
Police say no money was taken
in the bold daylight robbery.

151
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:01,301
The wounded suspect, Martin Elias,
underwent surgery at...

152
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,276
St Mary's Hospital and is said to be
in guarded condition at this hour.

153
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:23,332
And then she offers me
head right there on the freeway.

154
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,797
She said her husband's gonna kill
her if she gets another ticket.

155
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,201
Well, l guess the jerk wouldn't mind
if she went down on the LAPD.

156
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:35,342
-Where's Elias?
-They moved him.

157
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:36,981
They what?

158
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,550
Don't look at us. These 2 Feds
showed up with a warrant.

159
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,915
Said they were transferring
the suspect out.

160
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,616
Doctor said they shouldn't
move him, but they moved him.

161
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:52,058
-And you just let them take him.
-We had no choice. They were FBl.

162
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:53,792
From what office?

163
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,600
This office. LA, l mean.

164
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,794
Dipshit,
we're from the LA office.

165
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:03,105
-Something you don't see everyday.
-What?

166
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:08,473
-This is bogus.
-l've seen these. lt's legitimate.

167
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,778
See the watermark?
The crest is reversed.

168
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:15,579
lt's supposed to be signed by the
Regional Bureau chief. Who's that?

169
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,386
Of course you don't. That's why my
6-year-old niece could've signed it.

170
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,015
You would have thought
it was official.

171
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,357
Lighten up, sweetie. The cameras
aren't rolling anymore.

172
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,229
Your 15 minutes of fame
are over.

173
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:30,290
Well, l've got news for you.
This suspect ends up dead...

174
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:32,937
your 15 minutes of fame
are just starting.

175
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:37,804
l'm gonna make sure your face ends
up on TV, magazine, newspaper...

176
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,069
post office and PTA newsletter
in this city.

177
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:45,340
That light enough for ya?
Sweetie?

178
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,418
-PTA newsletter?
-l was on a roll.

179
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:56,653
Hold up, kid.

180
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,126
Before you go off all half-cocked,
let's call the bureau...

181
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,492
put out an APB
on our mystery feds.

182
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:05,262
-You think that's our best move?
-Unless you got a better one.

183
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,866
Well, it seems to me this wasn't
amateur night at the lmprov.

184
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,441
These guys knew what they were
doing. Had a top-shelf forgery.

185
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:12,672
Meaning?

186
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:14,544
Maybe we should look one more
time before crossing the street.

187
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:20,216
Dig up more on this guy Elias. Find
out what's really going on there.

188
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:25,553
You plan on using a shovel?
Or your customary sledgehammer?

189
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,717
You think l was
too harsh back there?

190
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:34,231
To act impulsively is heartfelt.
But never head-felt.

191
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:38,102
You're creeping me out, Frank.
When did you get so soft?

192
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,165
l started Tai Chi.

193
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:48,109
-Try it. lt takes away the stress.
-l like stress.

194
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,478
Hello, Martin.

195
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:01,651
Wow, you don't look good.

196
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,389
Addison.

197
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,730
You still breathing, man?

198
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:18,667
Christ, you must be over
a hundred by now.

199
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,572
-Turn 95 next week.
-l'll bet.

200
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:27,543
Hey, would you do me the favor
of removing the goggles?

201
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:31,314
l'd like to see
what a cold war relic looks like.

202
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,188
l'm sorry, l can't do that.
You know what they say.

203
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,390
''What you can't see
can't hurt me.''

204
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,488
l guess you know
why l'm here.

205
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,391
Let me guess.

206
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:47,327
You decided to stop killing
for the government...

207
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:51,197
and you've become
a paramedic.

208
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:54,444
Not quite.

209
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:58,878
Where is he?

210
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,244
Where is who, man?

211
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:07,989
Where is he?

212
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,096
They're recruiting again,
aren't they? Where can l find him?

213
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,465
Nowhere, man.

214
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:16,696
Everywhere.

215
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:21,339
Just kill me.

216
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:25,535
Frears.

217
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,678
Meet my new associate,
Agent Frears.

218
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,184
He's a quick learner.

219
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:38,585
Pleased to meet you, man.

220
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,558
Now, l'm gonna ask you
one more time.

221
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:46,261
Where can l find Adrian Geiger?

222
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:13,549
Good evening, Professor.

223
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:17,222
Running again, are we?

224
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:21,264
Do l know you?

225
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,263
No, not formally.
But we know you.

226
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:29,833
My name is Addison.
l'm with the Pentagon.

227
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:35,303
Specifically, a special division
designed with one thing in mind.

228
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:39,206
To keep track of people
with your unique abilities.

229
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:43,384
l don't know who you think l am,
but you got the wrong guy.

230
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:52,825
That was quite a feat
you performed the other night.

231
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,831
What are you talking about?

232
00:23:57,702 --> 00:24:00,364
People describe it as intense
static electricity...

233
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,702
coursing through your veins.

234
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,135
Your muscles get taut.

235
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:10,376
The hair all over your body
stands up.

236
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:13,511
Your vision becomes
tunneled.

237
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:18,583
An ordinary person is able to move
an object without even touching it.

238
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:21,952
Sound familiar?

239
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:29,923
lt's time to stop running. Denying
who you are and what you can do.

240
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:34,195
What do you want?

241
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:36,802
We want your help.

242
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:42,503
For the last 20 years l've been
tracking down a group of criminals...

243
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:47,617
who possess the same gift as you.
Their leader is Adrian Geiger.

244
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:51,045
-You'll be tracking him down.
-l'll be tracking down?

245
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,524
l'm a Physics teacher.
l'm not one of your agents.

246
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,184
l know you're not.

247
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:00,497
But my agents tried
to infiltrate the group...

248
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,600
to check out the scope
of their operation.

249
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:05,030
They tried and failed,
l take it.

250
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,832
Look, we're not trying to
infiltrate the mob here.

251
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:11,901
This group only trusts people
who can do what they do.

252
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,169
So, if they ask you to move
something with your mind...

253
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,780
there better not be
any fucking strings attached.

254
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:20,107
Half of my agents tried,
and they were all murdered.

255
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,947
l don't want to be next.

256
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:28,058
l can't help you.
l'm sorry.

257
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,052
Do you know
what would happen...

258
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,521
if the world knew what you did
in that store the other night?

259
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:40,862
ln one hour, it would turn you into
a goddamn global phenomenon.

260
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,635
Your life would never
be the same.

261
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:54,014
l'm asking you to use your gift
to stop them from abusing theirs.

262
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,050
Nice meeting you.
Frears.

263
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,240
Okay, l'm in.
What do l do?

264
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:19,271
Go 12 miles on Canyon Lake Road
until it dead-ends.

265
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:22,408
-That's where it's going down.
-How do l find them?

266
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,978
Our source said that they use
a code word: ''Raze''.

267
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:29,218
-Then the recruiter finds you.
-And if he doesn't?

268
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,555
Pray he does.

269
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:26,268
Three-fifty.

270
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:30,271
l'm looking for someone.

271
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,885
You mustn't be
looking too hard.

272
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:46,764
-This someone got a name?
-Raze.

273
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:50,797
l'll ask around.
Come back later.

274
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:06,846
-Do you come here often?
-Do l what?

275
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:10,688
-Come here often?
-All the time.

276
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,490
Never would have guessed.
Hawk!

277
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:19,653
-Can l borrow your cell phone?
-Fuck off, Tristen.

278
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,993
Last time you called
some ex-boyfriend in London.

279
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:33,408
-Want to help me out?
-Long distance?

280
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:38,071
Local.
2 minutes. l swear.

281
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:52,654
-Oh, damn.
-Where are you going?

282
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,735
-Hey, what are you doing?
-There's no signal.

283
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:04,066
l love this song.

284
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:10,742
l got this thing for first-timers.
l like to break them in.

285
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:13,807
Who said it's my first time?

286
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:15,679
l just have this feeling.

287
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,282
What's going on?

288
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,927
Your wallet and your car keys.
Now.

289
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,090
You're kidding, right?

290
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:40,741
-Better do what l say.
-Great.

291
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,974
Lure some asshole out here...

292
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,183
and take all his shit.

293
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,010
Works every time.

294
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:53,016
You rich white boys think you can
just come out her and roll with us.

295
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:54,782
Hawk, put the gun away.

296
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:57,360
You'd be surprised how long
it takes to find a body out here.

297
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:59,292
-Wait.
-We're done waiting.

298
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,933
-Back up.
-You're not gonna shoot me.

299
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:10,597
You heard me.
Back up.

300
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:18,008
We don't need bullets.

301
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:24,955
l told you he had it in him.
l felt it the first time l saw him.

302
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:38,028
What's this?

303
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:40,103
lt's your ticket
to the promised land.

304
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,901
Bottoms up.
lt's a long ride.

305
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:14,869
Come on!

306
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:28,780
LAPD!

307
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:37,092
Search around.

308
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,397
We've got nothing
here.

309
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:47,429
Are we sure Elias
lives here?

310
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:50,137
Positive. Landlord recognized
his mugshot from the news.

311
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,239
Said Elias came and went
like a ghost.

312
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:58,482
-Looks like he was moving out.
-Or planning a quick getaway.

313
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:04,687
What ya got?

314
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,190
A book on telekinesis.

315
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:09,756
Seems our pal Elias was quite
interested in the subject matter.

316
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:13,427
-What's telekinesis?
-You move things with your mind.

317
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:16,691
-Like bending spoons?
-Yeah, spoons, forks, whatever.

318
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:18,296
Only silverware?

319
00:32:18,469 --> 00:32:20,630
l don't know. lt's all bullshit smoke
and mirrors anyway.

320
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:37,718
Now there's something
you don't see everyday.

321
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,977
What did l tell you, Josh? You're
not gonna learn anything that way.

322
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:44,047
Now put down the remote control
and do it right.

323
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:59,029
Well done.
Now the tank.

324
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,277
Good.

325
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:20,519
Morning.
How's your head?

326
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:24,086
We call that
a recruitment cocktail.

327
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:27,995
Young man's got quite a talent,
don't you think?

328
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:30,862
Show him what else you can do,
Josh.

329
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:45,272
Good try, Josh.

330
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,055
Go inside, Josh.

331
00:34:57,995 --> 00:34:59,758
So you're the new stray
they brought in.

332
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,326
-Don't look like much to me.
-Go easy, Lincoln.

333
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,660
What would you have done...

334
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,669
if l didn't stop that
from hitting you?

335
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:14,270
Anybody can move something
when it's that close.

336
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,445
How about something
more distant?

337
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:35,355
Hell, Adrian,
that's too far.

338
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,097
You're the only one
who can reach that.

339
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,826
Humor me.

340
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,233
Merely tip it over.

341
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:06,958
Don't think you can move it.
Know you can move it.

342
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,330
He's gonna blow.

343
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,447
What are you laughing at?

344
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,277
That's enough, Lincoln.

345
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:36,816
Let's give the man a chance.

346
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:42,591
Go on.
Show us what you can do.

347
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:48,731
No, l can't.

348
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,632
That's not good enough.

349
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:53,208
You can try and fail,
but you will try.

350
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:56,602
This should be good.

351
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:07,843
Don't mean shit.

352
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:21,490
Okay, listen to this.

353
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:26,025
''Some researchers believe primitive
man may've had telekinetic ability.

354
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,966
But as we developed,
we lost the capacity...

355
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:30,937
to access
that part of our brain.''

356
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:35,240
Rumor has it that the government
did experiments in the '70's...

357
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:38,514
to see if it was possible
to re-access that ability.

358
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:41,545
Was that before or after
aliens assassinated Kennedy?

359
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:45,019
Come on, Ripps. Don't tell me
you're taking this shit seriously.

360
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,521
A truck with a mind of its own?

361
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:51,193
Utensils in the ceiling? None of
this strikes you as out there?

362
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:53,626
Hey, the world's
full of weird shit.

363
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,665
lt all started
with those blue M&M's.

364
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,826
Okay, what do you want to do?

365
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:03,931
Check and see if there's unusual
robberies in the area. lf there are...

366
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:06,474
We call in
Mulder and Skully.

367
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:18,588
l'm watching them as we speak.
Yes, Agents Mclntyre and Ripps.

368
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:21,752
He's a career Fed,
veteran field agent.

369
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:24,186
Smart, but definitely
won't cross the line.

370
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:26,786
Ripps, on the other hand...

371
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:33,364
-she could be a problem.
-Then make sure she isn't.

372
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:35,232
What about the tracer
on the professor?

373
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,303
Signal's weak, but l expect to
have that fixed within the hour.

374
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:40,307
Good.
Let me know when you do.

375
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,447
Welcome to our camp.

376
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,578
lt's a temporary safe haven
for those with the gift.

377
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,854
A place where they can hone
their skills away from ...

378
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:54,457
the judgment and persecution
of the outside world.

379
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,892
You showed an abundance
of talent back there.

380
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,762
But you hesitated to use it.
Why?

381
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:08,063
-l don't know.
-l can help you with that.

382
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:14,967
But first you must realize what
you have is a gift, not a curse.

383
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:18,712
Come. l want to show you
something.

384
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:00,716
You already met Tristen.

385
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:03,787
She spoke highly
of your abilities.

386
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,287
She must be
easily impressed.

387
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:10,989
She's rather discriminating
of the company she keeps.

388
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:14,366
A lot more than you,
l'm afraid.

389
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:21,567
This was found
in your wallet and disabled.

390
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:25,847
Who sent you?

391
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:31,785
Let me clarify your situation. The
only reason you're still alive...

392
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:34,652
is because Tristen sensed
something special in you.

393
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:37,190
As it happens,
l feel it too.

394
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:40,855
But have no doubt.

395
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,995
You lie to us, you won't leave
this room alive.

396
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:49,039
So, who sent you?

397
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:53,609
You want a name? Or should
l just say the government?

398
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:55,210
lt's Addison, isn't it?

399
00:41:56,914 --> 00:42:00,315
-You know him?
-He's been after us for years.

400
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:03,445
Trying to track us down.

401
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:07,015
But you're the first
he's sent who has the gift.

402
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:11,725
How did he convince you?
Blackmail?

403
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:16,430
The man's losing his touch
in his old age.

404
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:18,294
He said you were murderers.

405
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:21,029
-That we're murderers?
-This is no game.

406
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:26,238
We're fighting for our survival. The
man isn't out to catch criminals.

407
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,242
He's trying to erase a mistake.

408
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:41,624
Addison ran a program
back in the '70's.

409
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:46,521
He recruited telekinetics
and trained them as weapons.

410
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,723
The program was called
''Momentum.''

411
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:54,666
You were a part of it?

412
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:57,300
l'm the only part left.

413
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:04,645
When they realized
how powerful we'd become...

414
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:07,774
they decided to terminate
the project and everyone in it.

415
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:12,850
l've spent every day since
on the run.

416
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,514
Trying to help those with the gift.
Trying to protect them.

417
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:20,057
Addison sees our kind
as a threat.

418
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:25,931
He won't stop until he finds us
and wipes us all out.

419
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:40,043
What Adrian said?

420
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:43,778
lt's all true.

421
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:48,156
We live in fear
every single day.

422
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:52,289
Hiding, moving from place to place
so no one finds us.

423
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,759
Must be hard
for you to believe.

424
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,424
No, not really.

425
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:05,434
You know, for the longest time
l thought l was the only one.

426
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:11,910
l never thought l'd find
anyone like me.

427
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,477
l know.

428
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:20,079
Most of us have spent our lives
thinking that we're outcasts.

429
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:23,321
That we don't fit in.

430
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:29,663
When did you first know?

431
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,533
That l had the gift?

432
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,672
l was 13.

433
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:44,371
These girls were teasing me...

434
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:47,613
and l broke their noses
without touching them.

435
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:51,350
l got suspended for a week.

436
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:57,758
l've read that it comes on
for most kids during puberty.

437
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:01,689
Did for me.

438
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:06,327
Well, l've had it
for as long as l can remember.

439
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:13,442
Every time l slipped up, my parents
would just pack up and move us.

440
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:19,876
After a while l just became
an expert at hiding it.

441
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:29,391
You don't have
to hide it anymore.

442
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,857
Geiger has a plan for us.

443
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:38,558
He thinks you're here
for a reason.

444
00:45:40,604 --> 00:45:41,935
So do l.

445
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,324
No hands.

446
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:25,434
Wait up!

447
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,491
-2 minutes.
-We won't need that long.

448
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:21,760
Hold it!

449
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:24,761
Time?

450
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,422
-45 seconds.
-Let's do it.

451
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,254
Hundred G easy.
Maybe 2.

452
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:58,558
Yeah. Right.
l'll tell him.

453
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:01,488
He's gone.
Took his car and split.

454
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:04,158
Son of a bitch.
l knew we couldn't trust him.

455
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:05,726
We have to find him.

456
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:06,928
-Don't bother.
-But Adrian...

457
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:10,268
Addison's using him. The minute
he gets back there, he's dead.

458
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:12,534
What if he gives away
our location?

459
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:16,504
-He won't.
-How the hell do you know?

460
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:18,881
Because he's one of us.

461
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:21,645
We can't take that risk.

462
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:30,649
He's right. We've got to get back
and prepare to move out.

463
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:33,296
We can trust him.

464
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:52,973
Guard didn't get a good look
at them...

465
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:56,615
but he thinks they were in and out
in under 2 minutes.

466
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:02,951
They cracked this door
in under 2?

467
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,592
lmpossible.

468
00:51:06,363 --> 00:51:08,661
Not this week.

469
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:31,414
These were ripped
open from the inside.

470
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:34,582
Just like the armored car.

471
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:38,126
Agent Ripps?

472
00:51:39,296 --> 00:51:40,456
What's this?

473
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:42,858
Robbery homicide sent it over. They
thought you should have a look.

474
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:50,272
-Now there's something...
-you don't see every day.

475
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:57,004
Would you look at that?

476
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:03,709
We got a name on this guy?

477
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:07,186
Clerk said he's a teacher over at
Westlake. Professor Zach Shefford.

478
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,085
Looks like we're going back
to school.

479
00:52:12,996 --> 00:52:14,463
This is Ripps.

480
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:18,323
What?

481
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:21,065
Wait a minute.
We're right in the middle...

482
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:23,633
No, of course not.

483
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:26,470
Yes, sir.

484
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,680
-They're pulling us off.
-What?

485
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:35,346
Somebody's pulling rank.

486
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:40,252
-l'm gonna make one more stop.
-Here we go.

487
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:08,309
Professor Shefford?

488
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:10,976
Agents Ripps and Zach.
Can we have a word?

489
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:24,998
No, l'm sorry, Agent Ripps.
l've never seen him before.

490
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:30,765
Jordan. He was arrested in that
armored car heist the other day.

491
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:35,767
Don't take this the wrong way, but
shouldn't you be questioning him?

492
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:40,141
We were going to.
He's kind of missing.

493
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,216
Did you tell him
about the ESP thing?

494
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:48,716
We found some books in this
guy's apartment on telekinesis.

495
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:52,725
-Know anything about the subject?
-Not really, no.

496
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:59,324
-But you must've read about it.
-A little bit, yeah.

497
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:02,104
How does it work?

498
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:06,275
lt doesn't. lt's
a hypothetical phenomenon.

499
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:08,811
How's it work
hypothetically?

500
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:17,949
lf l remember right the most common
theory is that someone...

501
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:21,681
makes a connection with an object
on a cellular level...

502
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:24,585
and moves it.

503
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:29,525
Have you ever seen someone
move something without touching it?

504
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:32,995
No. l can't say l have.

505
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:36,137
Okay.

506
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:40,099
Well, l guess that's it, then.
Thank you for your time, Professor.

507
00:54:41,411 --> 00:54:43,572
-Thanks.
-Sure.

508
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:49,585
What about something big?
Like an armored car?

509
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:53,878
lt wouldn't be possible to connect
with it on a cellular level...

510
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:56,283
and flip it over?
Would it?

511
00:54:58,828 --> 00:55:00,386
That would be impossible.

512
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:05,363
That's what l figured.
Thanks again.

513
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:10,767
So, what do you think?

514
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:14,468
Never having met him before
and knowing almost nothing...

515
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,204
about him, l'd say
he's lying out his ass.

516
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:20,209
You're just upset
because he didn't recognize you.

517
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,921
-You said this was the last stop.
-lt still is.

518
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:30,283
Just give me a few more hours.
lf l'm wrong, we'll walk.

519
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:33,621
l hate stakeouts.
My ass gets numb.

520
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:35,692
Gravity's a bitch.
TlTLE

521
00:55:58,121 --> 00:55:59,486
Put that down.

522
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:02,090
Can you imagine how proud they'd
be if they could see you now?

523
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:04,951
What are you doing here?

524
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:08,292
You had me worried there
for awhile.

525
00:56:09,132 --> 00:56:10,827
Thought you were
changing teams.

526
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:12,567
l'm not on a team.

527
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:15,430
Oh, l've got news for you.
Everybody's on a team.

528
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:18,635
You just pick a side and hope
you pick the right one.

529
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:21,939
The right one?
There is no right one.

530
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:25,512
You want to expose me?
Go for it. l've been through worse.

531
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:30,217
-You found them, didn't you?
-Didn't tell me about the project.

532
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:32,182
You didn't need to know.

533
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:35,286
You're not trying to arrest them,
you're trying to wipe them out.

534
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:37,489
l am trying
to protect this nation.

535
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:42,096
Nobody with that kind of power
can be trusted.

536
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:46,066
Especially a fanatic
like Geiger.

537
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:48,971
Now think about it,
Professor.

538
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,935
Today, robbery.
Tomorrow, terrorism.

539
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,509
What's to prevent a foreign gov from
paying them to turn against us?

540
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:58,272
You should have thought about that
before you trained them.

541
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:02,082
We hadn't planned on creating
a weapon that can do what they can.

542
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,921
Geiger's got people all over
this country waiting for orders.

543
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:11,558
Don't walk away.
Not now.

544
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:17,097
Good night.

545
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:13,756
The others want to know
why we're not moving out.

546
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:15,448
They're not coming.

547
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:19,592
How do you know?

548
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:22,354
l know.

549
00:58:26,135 --> 00:58:29,969
lf you're wrong, this could be
the end of everything.

550
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:34,032
lt's just the beginning.

551
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:02,635
Christ.

552
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:05,501
-You scared the hell out of me.
-Sorry.

553
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:08,300
l saw your light on.

554
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:13,176
l didn't think l'd see you again.

555
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:16,841
Well, you were wrong.

556
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:23,050
l just wanted you to know that if
you ever need to talk, l'll be here.

557
00:59:29,165 --> 00:59:31,656
Besides, what would you
do without me?

558
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,835
-Who are these guys?
-Addison sent them.

559
01:00:51,514 --> 01:00:53,880
Which means
you didn't sell us out.

560
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:55,880
-l knew it.
-What?

561
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:57,948
You're with us.

562
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:00,686
-l'm not with anyone.
-We need you, Zach.

563
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:02,915
Your strength.

564
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:05,460
Addison says Geiger
has sleeper cells in place.

565
01:01:05,795 --> 01:01:08,662
That he's gonna use people
like us to start a war.

566
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:11,660
ls that true?
What's he gonna do?

567
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:14,396
-Preserve our kind.
-How far is he gonna go?

568
01:01:14,937 --> 01:01:16,529
He's out of control.

569
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,402
He's tired of living in fear.

570
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,769
We all are.

571
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:25,979
-There's got to be another way.
-There isn't.

572
01:02:05,955 --> 01:02:09,118
-Now there's something you don't...
-Start the damn car, Frank.

573
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:44,524
-How many are there?
-Just your boy so far.

574
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:51,025
l got to tell you, my gut says
we should bring in some backup.

575
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:56,265
Sure, if you want to lose our jobs.
We're not exactly on the clock.

576
01:02:57,974 --> 01:02:59,498
Let's just wait and see.

577
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:07,338
Company.

578
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:09,615
Leave him to me.

579
01:03:17,093 --> 01:03:18,754
Addison's got Tristen.

580
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:30,234
Now ya know what it feels like. The
fear that comes with being hunted.

581
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:34,239
Addison tried to kill you,
didn't he?

582
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,703
He's killed
dozens of innocents.

583
01:03:37,413 --> 01:03:41,213
And he'll keep killing.
Driving us towards extinction.

584
01:03:42,585 --> 01:03:46,077
He created a weapon.
The most dangerous of all.

585
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:50,016
One that thinks and breathes
and feels.

586
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:54,987
But now they're afraid of what it
can do so they want to destroy it.

587
01:03:56,399 --> 01:04:00,335
They used you, Zach.
Turned you against your own kind.

588
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:09,037
Time has come
to make a choice.

589
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:14,071
Unless you want to try your luck
with Addison alone.

590
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:17,752
ls what Addison said
about you true?

591
01:04:18,387 --> 01:04:22,084
We're nomads.
Always on the move.

592
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:25,160
Always seeking sanctuary.

593
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:29,687
Your parents, they were nomads too,
weren't they?

594
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:32,832
Always on the run. Never staying
in one place too long.

595
01:04:33,002 --> 01:04:34,594
They were smart to do that.

596
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:37,130
They did that for your protection
and theirs.

597
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:43,972
Running is a hard way to live.

598
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:52,779
You spent your whole life
hiding your gift.

599
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,551
Fearing it.

600
01:04:56,125 --> 01:05:03,463
-The time has come to embrace it.
-What could you hope to accomplish?

601
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:05,490
To be recognized.

602
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:10,330
Others may fear or revere us.

603
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,899
That's a choice
that l'll leave up to them.

604
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:18,110
But l promise you, we will be
a power to be reckoned with.

605
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:21,273
At what expense?
Why don't you just make it public?

606
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:22,747
Go to the goddamned press.

607
01:05:22,885 --> 01:05:26,480
And what? Take center stage
in a 3-ring media circus? No.

608
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:33,187
No, when we rise up,
we'll make the news.

609
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:38,661
What about Tristen?

610
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:47,168
Don't worry about Tristen.

611
01:06:05,995 --> 01:06:08,759
Super-size them.

612
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:28,146
Frank...

613
01:06:35,057 --> 01:06:38,493
This is bad. Right?

614
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:42,490
You could say that.

615
01:06:50,806 --> 01:06:52,899
Good morning, agents.

616
01:06:53,576 --> 01:06:56,044
That's one
fucking bright light.

617
01:06:56,712 --> 01:06:58,976
ls that a halogen bulb
you got in there?

618
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:02,715
Why were you doing
trespassing on private property?

619
01:07:03,919 --> 01:07:07,912
Our car broke down. lt's a good
thing you came along when you did.

620
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:12,484
lf you uncuff us, we can avoid
charging you with kidnapping.

621
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:14,319
Of course.

622
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,269
Neat trick.

623
01:07:26,542 --> 01:07:28,840
Can you pull a bunny
out of your ass too?

624
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:33,844
What the fuck?

625
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:44,589
lt's of the utmost importance
that l find out what you know.

626
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:48,292
We don't know anything.

627
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:52,192
Except you'll have a big power bill
if you don't turn that light off.

628
01:07:53,502 --> 01:07:54,969
Have it your way.

629
01:07:55,137 --> 01:07:57,435
May l see your fingers,
Agent Mclntyre?

630
01:08:01,977 --> 01:08:04,502
Any specific finger
you have in mind?

631
01:08:12,788 --> 01:08:14,380
Now, then.

632
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:18,149
You were saying...

633
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:45,549
Goddamn it, stop it.
We don't know anything.

634
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:47,416
We'll soon find out.

635
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:18,085
That was very impressive
last night.

636
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:20,148
Looks like
we underestimated you.

637
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:21,915
Where is she?

638
01:09:22,124 --> 01:09:26,390
lsla Vista. Where we trained him.
This is your chance to be a hero.

639
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:30,361
l'm proposing a trade.
Geiger for the girl.

640
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:32,166
He won't go for it.

641
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:34,701
-Sure he will.
-Why would he?

642
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:36,771
Because we're talking about
his daughter.

643
01:09:42,244 --> 01:09:44,542
Your friend's thumb
is gonna be next.

644
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,773
Why don't you do him
a favor and start talking?

645
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:51,409
We were investigating
an armored car robbery.

646
01:09:53,889 --> 01:09:57,586
-Who sent you?
-Nobody. Just following Shefford.

647
01:09:57,693 --> 01:10:00,628
-l don't believe you.
-Believe what you want, asshole.

648
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:04,561
Because in 5 minutes this place is
gonna be swarming with FBl.

649
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:09,298
5 minutes? Then we have no more
time to waste. Lincoln?

650
01:10:19,648 --> 01:10:21,616
Who the fuck are you?

651
01:10:39,635 --> 01:10:41,000
We're in motion.

652
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:43,570
Good, round everybody up.
Let's get out of here.

653
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:54,443
Adrian, how many
people have to die?

654
01:10:54,617 --> 01:10:57,484
As many as necessary.
They were sent to kill us.

655
01:10:58,287 --> 01:11:01,313
One person wants you dead.
One.

656
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:05,223
He says he'll hand over Tristen
in exchange for you.

657
01:11:06,629 --> 01:11:08,859
Where?

658
01:11:08,998 --> 01:11:11,694
-The place where he trained you.
-Bullshit. Don't believe him.

659
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:19,167
Goddamnit, Adrian.
She's alive.

660
01:11:20,542 --> 01:11:22,669
Adrian, it's a trap.

661
01:11:24,313 --> 01:11:25,678
l know.

662
01:11:29,251 --> 01:11:30,411
What about her?

663
01:11:33,155 --> 01:11:34,884
Finish what you started.

664
01:11:45,834 --> 01:11:49,292
-lt's okay. Come with me.
-Not a chance.

665
01:11:53,175 --> 01:11:56,269
-She's not a part of this.
-But you are.

666
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:39,580
Lights out, asshole.

667
01:12:55,604 --> 01:12:57,265
Get the car before
anyone sees you. Go ahead.

668
01:13:03,178 --> 01:13:05,112
Agent Ripps.
Clearance code 5512.

669
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,077
Okay, Agent Ripps.
Standby for repatch.

670
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:09,315
Repatch?

671
01:13:12,821 --> 01:13:15,051
Josh, where's Geiger?

672
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:18,750
He left with Hawk.
Are we leaving again?

673
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:22,457
Yeah. Time to go.

674
01:13:23,932 --> 01:13:25,695
Come on, Josh.
We're leaving.

675
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:30,602
Zach, come on!
Get in!

676
01:13:51,393 --> 01:13:53,793
Thank you for what
you did back there.

677
01:13:54,663 --> 01:13:57,723
l'm sorry about your partner.

678
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:18,150
l called for backup. They should
be here any minute.

679
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:19,845
What?
What did you do that for?

680
01:14:20,856 --> 01:14:22,881
-These people are dangerous.
-Yeah, they're dangerous.

681
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:25,357
You've got to call them off before
more of your agents end up dead.

682
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:28,795
Shit. Where the hell are they?

683
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:34,424
What are you doing?

684
01:14:37,072 --> 01:14:38,664
Making you listen to me.

685
01:14:39,074 --> 01:14:41,167
l know what Geiger's planning.
l know where he's going.

686
01:14:41,276 --> 01:14:43,039
Forget it We're waiting
here for help.

687
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:44,610
l'm the only chance
you've got

688
01:14:45,013 --> 01:14:48,574
Send your people in there against
them, it's gonna be World War 3.

689
01:14:49,351 --> 01:14:51,581
Never underestimate
the government.

690
01:14:54,389 --> 01:14:55,981
You can say that again.

691
01:14:58,293 --> 01:15:00,056
Those aren't your agents.

692
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:04,393
Those are Addison's guys.

693
01:15:19,882 --> 01:15:21,679
We've got to get out of here.
Let's go.

694
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:31,585
-Jordan, you can't help them.
-l have to try.

695
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,284
-lt's too late.
-Not too late.

696
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:36,396
-Addison killed them all.
-You saw it yourself. They're gone.

697
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:38,299
They're gone.

698
01:15:39,601 --> 01:15:41,865
And you'll be next.
ls that what you want?

699
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:48,107
l'll tell you everything.
But we gotta go. Now.

700
01:15:51,747 --> 01:15:52,941
Affirmative, sir.

701
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:55,310
The site's been neutralized.
Cleanup crew is on its way.

702
01:15:55,951 --> 01:15:58,647
This time tomorrow, no one
will know it was even there.

703
01:15:58,887 --> 01:16:01,151
Well done. What about Geiger?

704
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:03,752
Most likely on his way to you.

705
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:04,957
Good.

706
01:16:20,842 --> 01:16:22,173
Project Momentum.

707
01:16:23,011 --> 01:16:24,569
How could they cover up...

708
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:26,976
something
that big all these years?

709
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:30,249
Like you said. Never
underestimate the government.

710
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:37,924
lf you're not part of that group,
what were you doing out there?

711
01:16:39,094 --> 01:16:40,493
That's a good question.

712
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:46,329
Geiger and Addison,
they're like 2 time bombs...

713
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:47,902
just waiting to go off.

714
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:51,295
Can you stop them?

715
01:17:30,779 --> 01:17:32,679
l'll give
base command a call.

716
01:17:48,864 --> 01:17:52,493
This is where it all began.
Where they trained us.

717
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:56,064
So this is it?

718
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:47,011
Brings back memories,
doesn't it?

719
01:18:47,622 --> 01:18:50,056
l would not do that
if l were you.

720
01:18:51,093 --> 01:18:52,458
You might get 2 or 3 of us.

721
01:18:52,594 --> 01:18:55,290
But rest assured:
she will die in the process.

722
01:18:58,834 --> 01:19:00,461
Welcome back, Adrian.

723
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:03,698
Place hasn't been the same
since you left.

724
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:05,936
You mean since you tried
to kill us.

725
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:08,909
Attention. This is not a drill.

726
01:19:09,010 --> 01:19:11,604
All personnel please
evacuate the facility immediately.

727
01:19:11,847 --> 01:19:13,781
This is not a drill.

728
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:18,352
Smart. Clear out the base. Make
sure no one sees what we can do.

729
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:23,387
Or is it what you're
about to do?

730
01:19:25,427 --> 01:19:27,622
Just like old times,
right, Ray?

731
01:19:28,363 --> 01:19:30,991
Close up shop,
pretend we never existed?

732
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:33,191
You're a threat to the security
of the nation.

733
01:19:33,368 --> 01:19:35,097
l am what you made me.

734
01:19:36,304 --> 01:19:40,035
We dedicated our lives to this
country and you tried to execute us.

735
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:42,103
You became too dangerous.

736
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:43,572
No, Ray.

737
01:19:44,646 --> 01:19:46,944
You took our ability
and made it dangerous.

738
01:19:47,082 --> 01:19:48,879
And then you turned against us.

739
01:19:49,851 --> 01:19:52,342
What did you expect us to do? We
were forced to protect ourselves.

740
01:19:52,687 --> 01:19:56,316
Self-preservation
is not an excuse for murder.

741
01:19:56,525 --> 01:19:59,050
For once, we agree.

742
01:20:12,774 --> 01:20:14,332
That's not possible.

743
01:20:14,442 --> 01:20:16,637
We've come a long way
since we were together.

744
01:20:17,012 --> 01:20:20,004
We're through being targets. Our
turn to show the world who we are.

745
01:20:21,149 --> 01:20:22,912
The real battle's
about to begin.

746
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:25,646
She's gonna take my place.

747
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:28,187
Because no one in this room
is gonna walk out alive.

748
01:20:31,193 --> 01:20:31,921
Fire.

749
01:21:08,029 --> 01:21:10,998
We were once ready to die
to protect our country.

750
01:21:12,734 --> 01:21:15,862
-Now it's your turn.
-Doesn't make any difference.

751
01:21:16,838 --> 01:21:20,069
Wherever you may go, wherever
you may hide, we'll find you.

752
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:24,209
-We'll hunt you down like animals.
-You'll never find us all.

753
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:28,004
We'll grow in numbers, gaining
strength, learning, prospering.

754
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:30,641
Sounds like a fucking disease.

755
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:34,577
Not a disease. Just a natural
step in our evolution.

756
01:21:35,323 --> 01:21:37,621
One which you were dumb
enough to make lethal.

757
01:21:41,863 --> 01:21:43,558
They're gone.

758
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:47,167
Everyone's dead.

759
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,800
They wiped out
the whole camp.

760
01:21:51,106 --> 01:21:53,540
He didn't leave anything to chance,
did you, Mr. Addison?

761
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,274
Goddamn you!

762
01:22:12,894 --> 01:22:16,728
ls this how you'll be recognized?
By starting a war you can't win?

763
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:18,995
Can't afford not to win.

764
01:22:20,068 --> 01:22:22,229
l can't let you do that.

765
01:22:22,837 --> 01:22:27,171
You should never have come.
Prepare to be moved.

766
01:22:56,538 --> 01:22:58,972
lf this is not your fight,
don't try to stop me.

767
01:22:59,507 --> 01:23:00,667
l'm gonna stop you.

768
01:23:08,383 --> 01:23:10,248
Take him out.

769
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:11,981
l can't reach him.
He's too far.

770
01:23:13,555 --> 01:23:15,079
Focus.

771
01:23:16,891 --> 01:23:21,624
Don't think about doing it.
Know you can do it.

772
01:23:55,997 --> 01:23:58,158
Don't let them win.

773
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:11,171
Come on. We've got to get out of
here. We've got to go right now.

774
01:24:13,181 --> 01:24:17,811
Where are we gonna go?
Who the hell's gonna believe us?

775
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:27,391
Yes, sir. l was working undercover
with Addison on this.

776
01:24:28,363 --> 01:24:30,729
l'm sorry to report he's dead.

777
01:24:30,999 --> 01:24:33,297
Along with my partner,
Frank Mclntyre.

778
01:24:33,401 --> 01:24:35,335
You have my condolences,
Agent Ripps.

779
01:24:35,837 --> 01:24:38,829
-You're sure this Geiger is gone?
-Positive, sir.

780
01:24:39,207 --> 01:24:41,641
l think you can officially
close the book on this.

781
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:44,769
What about
this Zach Shefford?

782
01:24:46,181 --> 01:24:50,811
He was at the farmhouse, sir.
He must be dead too.

783
01:24:52,887 --> 01:24:55,447
Very well. You've done
a great service, Agent.

784
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:57,490
We'll need to debrief you
as soon as possible.

785
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:02,029
Give me your location. l can have
units there in 10 minutes.

786
01:25:15,844 --> 01:25:20,907
lt's done. They're coming
for me. You have to go.

787
01:25:28,389 --> 01:25:30,152
l don't know what to say.

788
01:25:30,825 --> 01:25:32,918
Don't say shit.
Just get out of here.

789
01:25:34,162 --> 01:25:38,656
Change your name. You won't have
to look over your shoulder anymore.

790
01:25:40,168 --> 01:25:41,658
What about you?

791
01:25:43,304 --> 01:25:44,999
Don't worry about me.
l'm blessed.

792
01:25:46,374 --> 01:25:47,636
Remember?

793
01:25:56,951 --> 01:25:58,748
Breaking news from San Diego...

794
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:02,014
where a train has derailed
after a bizarre bridge collapse.

795
01:26:02,223 --> 01:26:05,522
At least 15 people are confirmed
dead at this hour.

796
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:08,558
Witnesses report
a horrifying scene...

797
01:26:08,663 --> 01:26:10,187
as the bridge
fell into the river...

798
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:13,061
seemingly ripped apart
by some unseen force.

799
01:26:13,268 --> 01:26:16,533
We take you live now where
Stacy Mitchens is on the scene.

800
01:26:17,805 --> 01:26:18,794
Zach, wait!

801
01:26:20,808 --> 01:26:22,969
Zach! Wait!

802
01:26:24,078 --> 01:26:25,010
Wait!

803
01:26:26,414 --> 01:26:27,745
What is this?

804
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:31,550
lt's Geiger's daughter. She wants
revenge her father's death.

805
01:26:31,653 --> 01:26:34,281
-What do you mean?
-She's picking up where he left off.

806
01:26:34,589 --> 01:26:36,557
Well, you have to go after her.
You have to stop her.

807
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:40,650
No. l'm done.

808
01:26:47,835 --> 01:26:51,032
You wanted a reason? You wanted
a reason you were given this gift.

809
01:26:51,139 --> 01:26:52,629
Well, this is it.

810
01:26:53,408 --> 01:26:55,876
You're the only one
who can stop her.

811
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:05,216
Federal agents!
ldentify yourself!

812
01:27:07,388 --> 01:27:10,084
Jordan Ripps!
