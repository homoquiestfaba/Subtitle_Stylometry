00:00:16,241 --> 00:00:19,494

00:00:25,582 --> 00:00:28,334
(train chugging)

6
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,843
- You don't look like you
was born in Templeton.

7
00:00:39,843 --> 00:00:41,178
You don't look Utah, even.

8
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,014
- Well, I was born here.

9
00:00:44,014 --> 00:00:46,349
My father was Lars Eriksen.

10
00:00:46,349 --> 00:00:49,268
- Oh my lord, you're the piano player.

11
00:00:49,268 --> 00:00:50,227
- That's me.

12
00:00:50,227 --> 00:00:51,478
- Erik Eriksen.

13
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:54,730
Me sitting next to a celebrity.

14
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,399
(Erik laughing)

15
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:59,943
(bright music)

00:01:17,165 --> 00:01:19,167
(train bell ringing)

19
00:01:19,167 --> 00:01:22,503
(train whistle blowing)

20
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,396
- Oh, oh, there it is.

21
00:01:55,446 --> 00:01:57,155
Oh my boy.
- Mama!

22
00:01:57,155 --> 00:01:58,281
- Oh my boy.
- Oh.

23
00:01:58,281 --> 00:02:00,325
- I'm so glad that you're home.

24
00:02:00,325 --> 00:02:02,368
Only don't break my ribs.

25
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,828
- Seenie, so good to see you.

26
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:06,288
- You're gonna have one busy Summer.

27
00:02:06,288 --> 00:02:08,539
I've got students lined up
all the way from Salt Lake

28
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:09,374
to take lessons.

29
00:02:09,374 --> 00:02:11,208
- Good, I could use the money.
(Seenie laughing)

30
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,335
- Only I'm afraid you're not
gonna have any time for me.

31
00:02:13,335 --> 00:02:16,296
I always like to improve my skills

32
00:02:16,296 --> 00:02:18,089
while you're in town. (laughing)

33
00:02:18,089 --> 00:02:19,923
So I hope you won't forget
your old piano teacher.

34
00:02:19,923 --> 00:02:22,384
- Seenie, I could never forget you.

35
00:02:22,384 --> 00:02:25,220
(Seenie laughing)

36
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,263
- I'll leave you to your mother.

37
00:02:27,263 --> 00:02:29,223
I just wanna be part of
the welcoming committee.

38
00:02:29,223 --> 00:02:30,766
- Oh, thanks.
- Bye.

39
00:02:33,143 --> 00:02:35,353
- Everybody's waiting at Christine's.

40
00:02:35,353 --> 00:02:37,187
- But Mother, it's been a long trip.

41
00:02:37,187 --> 00:02:39,148
Don't I even get a chance to wash up?

42
00:02:39,148 --> 00:02:40,482
- They're waiting.

43
00:02:40,482 --> 00:02:43,234
- I don't know if I'm
ready for all that brood.

44
00:02:43,234 --> 00:02:45,028
- Erik, they're your brothers.

45
00:02:45,028 --> 00:02:47,279
- Half brothers, Mother.

46
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:49,281
Half brothers.

47
00:02:49,281 --> 00:02:53,034
(car horn honking)
(bright instrumental music)

48
00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:55,536
(dog barking)

49
00:02:57,788 --> 00:02:59,455
- [Ivor] You, you too, come on.

50
00:02:59,455 --> 00:03:02,542
All right, come on, everybody.
(horse neighing)

51
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:05,585
Oh, Well it's about time
that you two got here.

52
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,211
- How are you, Ivor?
- Oh, Erik.

53
00:03:08,797 --> 00:03:12,758
Oh, my my my, don't you look fine.

54
00:03:12,758 --> 00:03:13,591
You'll play for us later, I hope.

55
00:03:13,591 --> 00:03:16,093
I had the piano tuned.
- Yes.

56
00:03:16,093 --> 00:03:17,804
- [Christine] Ida, thanks
for getting him here.

57
00:03:17,804 --> 00:03:19,638
It ain't always easy.
- Ivor.

58
00:03:19,638 --> 00:03:20,639
- Little Erik getting too high up

59
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,473
for us country hicks.

60
00:03:22,473 --> 00:03:24,017
- Ah, well, I gotta
get back in the kitchen

61
00:03:24,017 --> 00:03:25,726
and see what's happening
with my leg of lamb.

62
00:03:25,726 --> 00:03:27,186
You come on with me, Ida.

63
00:03:27,186 --> 00:03:28,813
- (laughing) Erik.

64
00:03:28,813 --> 00:03:29,729
- Hey.

65
00:03:31,398 --> 00:03:32,231
Oh, Jens.

66
00:03:34,442 --> 00:03:36,985
- Ah, hey, you remember Chel Bowen.

67
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:39,112
- [Erik] Well, I remember a little girl.

68
00:03:39,112 --> 00:03:40,363
- Well, I grew up.

69
00:03:40,363 --> 00:03:41,573
- [Jens] We're engaged to be married.

70
00:03:41,573 --> 00:03:42,782
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

71
00:03:42,782 --> 00:03:43,866
- Congratulations.

72
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:45,492
- He's fixing up the Bessie house.

73
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:47,994
Dairy barn, latest equipment.

74
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,495
Capper, separator.

75
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:50,913
- Bottle washer.
(Jens laughing)

76
00:03:50,913 --> 00:03:52,206
- She's way more than that.

77
00:03:52,206 --> 00:03:54,249
Chel can do about anything she wants.

78
00:03:54,249 --> 00:03:55,375
- She can also play the piano.

79
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,168
You're gonna have a little
competitions there, Erik.

80
00:03:57,168 --> 00:03:58,962
- No, not really.

81
00:03:58,962 --> 00:04:01,046
No it's, not like--

82
00:04:01,046 --> 00:04:03,090
- She plays every night down at the show.

83
00:04:03,966 --> 00:04:05,425
Hey, how about some lessons this Summer?

84
00:04:05,425 --> 00:04:06,801
- Yes.
- Ivor.

85
00:04:06,801 --> 00:04:07,677
- What?

86
00:04:07,677 --> 00:04:09,678
It'll be a wedding present.

87
00:04:09,678 --> 00:04:12,723
I mean, Erik will give
me the family reduction.

88
00:04:13,723 --> 00:04:15,433
It's not like I'm one of
them jokers from Salt Lake

89
00:04:15,433 --> 00:04:17,059
who pays two dollars a pop.

90
00:04:17,059 --> 00:04:17,977
- Lessons are free.

91
00:04:18,853 --> 00:04:20,895
Oh, and they're my wedding present.

92
00:04:20,895 --> 00:04:23,314
You prepared for a lot of hard work?

93
00:04:23,314 --> 00:04:24,773
- I'll practice night and day.

94
00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:25,691
I promise.

95
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:28,318
Thank you.

96
00:04:28,318 --> 00:04:29,277
- Well, you got me to
thank for this, Chel.

97
00:04:29,277 --> 00:04:31,112
Don't forget that.

98
00:04:31,112 --> 00:04:32,614
Come on, let's go get something to eat.

99
00:04:32,614 --> 00:04:33,781
- Some meats today.
(group chattering)

100
00:04:33,781 --> 00:04:34,906
I, I fixed these
- I know how you like

101
00:04:34,906 --> 00:04:36,575
that chicken.
- special.

102
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:39,494
(group chattering)

103
00:04:42,538 --> 00:04:43,580
- Erik.

104
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,165
Very nice to see you
back at the table again.

105
00:04:45,165 --> 00:04:46,541
He look good, don't he, Mama?

106
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:47,667
- He's too thin.

107
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:48,501
- No thinner than he was.

108
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:51,254
He was always a hound.
- That's right.

109
00:04:51,254 --> 00:04:52,838
- How long you planning on staying?

110
00:04:52,838 --> 00:04:53,922
- Just for the Summer.

111
00:04:53,922 --> 00:04:55,923
- Things prosperous for you back East?

112
00:04:55,923 --> 00:04:57,424
- Still a musician.

113
00:04:57,424 --> 00:04:58,760
Impoverished.

114
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,344
- Erik's not interested in money.

115
00:05:00,344 --> 00:05:01,470
- When did I say that?
- Oh.

116
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,763
- Erik's an artist.

117
00:05:02,763 --> 00:05:04,347
- Old pa always favored little Erik.

118
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:06,974
- Oh shush, your father
loved you all the same.

119
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,683
My boys got all the land,

120
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,810
and Ida's boy got the music lessons.

121
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,186
(laughing)

122
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,396
Alright, everybody eat up now.

123
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,648
There's lots more where that came from.

124
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,691
- All us boys in there, it was hard work.

125
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:18,859
- [Jens] You got that right.

126
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:20,902
- All Erik had to do was play the piano.

127
00:05:20,902 --> 00:05:21,736
- Oh, no.

128
00:05:21,736 --> 00:05:24,446
- Erik went off to war,
now don't you forget that.

129
00:05:24,446 --> 00:05:26,156
- Erik also came back, didn't he?

130
00:05:26,156 --> 00:05:26,990
- Ivor.

131
00:05:28,074 --> 00:05:29,367
Don't let him get to you, Erik.

132
00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:31,869
He needs a wife to rein him in.

133
00:05:31,869 --> 00:05:32,745
- That's right.

134
00:05:33,662 --> 00:05:36,080
- We was hoping to see
your wife this time, Erik.

135
00:05:37,832 --> 00:05:38,917
- Well.

136
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:40,834
Maybe mama forgot to tell you.

137
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:42,419
Athena and I are divorced.

138
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:43,796
- Erik, please, not now.

139
00:05:43,796 --> 00:05:45,380
- Mom, it's the truth.

140
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,632
It happens to a lot of
people in the other world.

141
00:05:49,675 --> 00:05:50,717
- Well, look at Erik.

142
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:52,928
Throwing away wives,

143
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:54,804
and I can't even manage to get me one.

144
00:05:54,804 --> 00:05:57,472
- Now would you just hush, hush.

145
00:06:00,434 --> 00:06:02,351
- Ain't that somethin'.

146
00:06:03,644 --> 00:06:06,689
(bright piano music)

147
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,589
- They enjoyed you so. (laughing)

148
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:39,673
Christine and the family.

149
00:06:39,673 --> 00:06:40,799
- Are you kidding?

150
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:42,133
Patronizing.

151
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:43,885
They treat us like the poor relations.

152
00:06:43,885 --> 00:06:47,847
- (laughing) Well Erik,
I guess that we are.

153
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,725
(laughing)

154
00:06:51,725 --> 00:06:52,559
Uh.

155
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,353
You've been smoking.

156
00:06:55,353 --> 00:06:56,687
- Mother, give up.

157
00:06:56,687 --> 00:06:58,021
I smoke, I even drink.

158
00:06:58,021 --> 00:06:59,606
I'm not a good Mormon, I never will be.

159
00:06:59,606 --> 00:07:01,524
- Erik, stop it, I hate that.

160
00:07:01,524 --> 00:07:02,734
- It's the truth.

161
00:07:02,734 --> 00:07:03,901
Mother, you might as well accept it.

162
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:05,444
I am not like one of Christine's boys.

163
00:07:05,444 --> 00:07:06,612
I am the bastard.

164
00:07:06,612 --> 00:07:07,613
(hand whacking against face)

165
00:07:07,613 --> 00:07:09,530
- Don't you say that.

166
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,365
Never.

167
00:07:10,365 --> 00:07:11,741
Don't you say that.

168
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,744
(light somber music)

169
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,248
Oh Erik.

170
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:22,708
I'm sorry.

171
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:24,792
Oh.

172
00:07:26,168 --> 00:07:27,712
And it's your first night home.

173
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:31,047
It's just,

174
00:07:33,258 --> 00:07:34,759
if you're a bastard,

175
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,803
what does that make me?

176
00:07:37,803 --> 00:07:40,222
(somber music)

177
00:07:40,222 --> 00:07:41,055
- Mother.

178
00:07:43,724 --> 00:07:45,643
- Lars Eriksen was a good man.

179
00:07:45,643 --> 00:07:47,352
He married me.

180
00:07:47,352 --> 00:07:49,187
It was legal under God.

181
00:07:49,187 --> 00:07:51,147
- He already had a wife and six children.

182
00:07:51,147 --> 00:07:52,982
Do you really think that
God had a hand in that?

183
00:07:52,982 --> 00:07:54,400
- Yes, I do.

184
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,943
They changed the rules is all.

185
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,112
Polygamy was God's way.

186
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:01,322
And then all of a sudden they said,

187
00:08:01,322 --> 00:08:02,489
that it was against the law.

188
00:08:02,489 --> 00:08:05,909
But I am still married to Lars Eriksen.

189
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:07,702
And he will have both his wives,

190
00:08:07,702 --> 00:08:10,871
Christine and me in the hereafter.

191
00:08:10,871 --> 00:08:11,997
Erik.

192
00:08:14,291 --> 00:08:15,792
He believed that.

193
00:08:17,502 --> 00:08:19,003
And I know it's true.

194
00:08:23,131 --> 00:08:26,133
(crickets chirping)

195
00:08:33,056 --> 00:08:34,682
(hammer pounding)

196
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:36,934
- Hauled the hay into
the big barn yesterday.

197
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,478
Milk house just needs shingles.

198
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,229
Hey, can you see this?

199
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,066
A sign right over here.

200
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,942
Canyon Dairy.

201
00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:49,527
Jens Eriksen, Proprietor.

202
00:08:49,527 --> 00:08:51,821
(chuckling)

203
00:08:55,449 --> 00:08:56,866
Did I ever tell you,

204
00:08:56,866 --> 00:09:00,453
you have beautiful fingers, Chel?

205
00:09:00,453 --> 00:09:02,120
- Yeah, good milkin' fingers.

206
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,789
(Jens laughing)

207
00:09:03,789 --> 00:09:06,123
- Have a hard time keeping
my hands off of you.

208
00:09:07,249 --> 00:09:08,417
So soft.

209
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,878
Don't think I ever felt skin so soft.

210
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,382
Can't sleep at nights just
thinking about holding you.

211
00:09:18,801 --> 00:09:20,302
Don't know if I can wait.

212
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,930
- Not until our wedding night.

213
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,848
Come on, I can't be late
for my first music lesson.

214
00:09:25,848 --> 00:09:27,474
- Oh yeah, your music lessons.

215
00:09:29,184 --> 00:09:30,143
Hey Ivor,

216
00:09:30,143 --> 00:09:32,019
bring the cows in before I get back.

217
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:33,645
- Alright.
- I'm nervous.

218
00:09:33,645 --> 00:09:35,064
- Scared of Erik?

219
00:09:35,064 --> 00:09:35,856
Good lord, Chel.

220
00:09:35,856 --> 00:09:37,899
He can never do anything but play piano.

221
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:47,365
(bright organ music)

222
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:03,294
Gotta hand it to him.

223
00:10:03,294 --> 00:10:05,171
Little Erik can sure play.

224
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,005
- Shh.

225
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:13,677
- You see, that's what I mean.

226
00:10:13,677 --> 00:10:15,388
- I see, alright.

227
00:10:15,388 --> 00:10:18,140
It's just I don't seem
to be able to bring it up

228
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:18,974
where it should--

229
00:10:18,974 --> 00:10:20,808
- We'll try that part a few more times.

230
00:10:20,808 --> 00:10:22,602
- You're too good, Erik.

231
00:10:22,602 --> 00:10:24,520
Way beyond this family.

232
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,397
You must've dropped out of the sky.

233
00:10:26,397 --> 00:10:28,815
- I've been working on
this piece for months.

234
00:10:28,815 --> 00:10:30,733
He does it like it was magic.

235
00:10:30,733 --> 00:10:32,234
- Seenie, I forgot to tell you,

236
00:10:32,234 --> 00:10:34,444
I offered your student here a few lessons

237
00:10:34,444 --> 00:10:35,404
as a wedding present.

238
00:10:35,404 --> 00:10:36,530
I under you're her teacher.

239
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,989
I hope it won't interfere.

240
00:10:37,989 --> 00:10:41,700
- And I thought marriage would
interfere with your music.

241
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,576
Seems like it can only help now.

242
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:46,663
- You oughta to try it
yourself sometime, Seenie.

243
00:10:46,663 --> 00:10:47,955
Marriage.

244
00:10:47,955 --> 00:10:49,623
- Oh.
(laughing)

245
00:10:49,623 --> 00:10:51,958
I'm president of the hopeless club,

246
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,460
and you can't accept a marriage proposal

247
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,754
until you're a past president.

248
00:10:56,754 --> 00:10:58,297
(group laughing)

249
00:10:58,297 --> 00:11:00,257
Thanks Erik, I'll work on the piece.

250
00:11:04,177 --> 00:11:06,219
- I guess we should get started.

251
00:11:06,219 --> 00:11:08,180
Jens said that you wanted to learn

252
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,182
something for the Friday matinee.

253
00:11:10,182 --> 00:11:11,057
- Oh no, Jens.

254
00:11:12,058 --> 00:11:13,600
- You'll need some hero music.

255
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:15,936
Isn't that right?

256
00:11:16,853 --> 00:11:18,646
(bright piano music)

257
00:11:18,646 --> 00:11:20,023
And some villain music.

258
00:11:20,023 --> 00:11:22,191
(dark piano music)
(laughing)

259
00:11:22,191 --> 00:11:24,734
And some innocent young girl music.

260
00:11:24,734 --> 00:11:26,235
(light piano music)

261
00:11:26,235 --> 00:11:27,486
And some horse music.

262
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:29,072
(playful piano music)

263
00:11:29,072 --> 00:11:31,865
- No, I want more than that.

264
00:11:31,865 --> 00:11:34,159
I wanna really play the piano.

265
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,868
Not just for Friday matinees.

266
00:11:38,204 --> 00:11:40,664
- Come sit down and
we'll see where we start.

267
00:11:42,165 --> 00:11:43,541
- She's scared of you, Erik,

268
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,001
I keep telling her,

269
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:46,544
you're practically her brother.

270
00:11:52,256 --> 00:11:53,674
- All right, uh.

271
00:11:54,967 --> 00:11:56,009
Play anything.

272
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:57,720
Anything that you're comfortable with.

273
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:05,309
(melodic piano music)

274
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,741
(engine puttering)

275
00:12:24,741 --> 00:12:25,575
- Chel.

276
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:29,995
Hey, don't let her compliments

277
00:12:29,995 --> 00:12:33,623
give you a big head now, Erik. (laughing)

278
00:12:38,002 --> 00:12:41,087
(bright piano music)

279
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:57,100
(woman weeping)

280
00:13:07,358 --> 00:13:10,528
(audience applauding)

281
00:13:24,205 --> 00:13:26,040
- I had no idea you were here.

282
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,999
- You have talent, Chel.

283
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:28,500
A sense of music, that's rare.

284
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:31,085
- Seenie always shows me the programs

285
00:13:31,085 --> 00:13:32,336
from your concerts.

286
00:13:32,336 --> 00:13:33,629
In places like England, even.

287
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:36,590
I feel so dumb playing
in front of the movies.

288
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,424
- Erik.

289
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:40,635
You probably don't remember me.

290
00:13:40,635 --> 00:13:41,469
- Ruby Snow.

291
00:13:42,512 --> 00:13:44,555
Of course I remember you.

292
00:13:44,555 --> 00:13:47,015
I remember I always used to see

293
00:13:47,015 --> 00:13:49,475
you and your mother up by Crystal Spring,

294
00:13:49,475 --> 00:13:51,977
picking water crests in the Summer.

295
00:13:51,977 --> 00:13:53,896
- Yeah, she's dead now.
- Oh.

296
00:13:55,105 --> 00:13:57,398
- Got me a baby, Karina.

297
00:13:57,398 --> 00:13:59,192
- [Erik] So you're a married lady.

298
00:13:59,192 --> 00:14:00,026
- No.

299
00:14:02,152 --> 00:14:04,612
- Well, you have a beautiful baby.

300
00:14:06,781 --> 00:14:08,950
I hope things work out
alright for you, Ruby.

301
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:11,618
(baby whining)

302
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:14,662
- I never forgot that time

303
00:14:14,662 --> 00:14:16,581
you ate my mother's cake, Chel.

304
00:14:18,207 --> 00:14:19,833
- Of course I ate it.

305
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:20,792
It was delicious.

306
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:28,298
(soft music)

307
00:14:29,091 --> 00:14:31,676
She brought a cake to school
for her birthday once.

308
00:14:31,676 --> 00:14:34,178
Nobody would eat a piece of it but me.

309
00:14:34,178 --> 00:14:35,346
'Cause I felt sorry for her.

310
00:14:35,346 --> 00:14:37,097
- Well, people always said
they were up to no good

311
00:14:37,097 --> 00:14:38,598
because they were half-breeds.

312
00:14:39,474 --> 00:14:40,600
God, I hate that term.

313
00:14:41,476 --> 00:14:43,227
Half-breeds.

314
00:14:43,227 --> 00:14:44,061
- Erik.

315
00:14:44,978 --> 00:14:46,104
Home for the Summer?

316
00:14:46,104 --> 00:14:47,814
- [Erik] That's right, Bill Mac.

317
00:14:47,814 --> 00:14:48,689
- You like the show?

318
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:49,982
- It was wonderful.
- Uh?

319
00:14:49,982 --> 00:14:50,816
- Music was wonderful, too.

320
00:14:50,816 --> 00:14:52,359
- Oh yeah, I can pick 'em.

321
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,861
- She's great.
- Goodnight.

322
00:14:53,861 --> 00:14:54,861
- Goodnight.

323
00:14:58,572 --> 00:15:00,116
- No Jens?

324
00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:01,867
- No, he's working at the house.

325
00:15:02,993 --> 00:15:04,702
- I'll walk you home, then.

326
00:15:04,702 --> 00:15:05,786
- Oh, that's not necessary.

327
00:15:05,786 --> 00:15:08,247
I always walk home alone after the show.

328
00:15:08,247 --> 00:15:10,207
- I have candy corns.

329
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:11,040
(car honking)
(gentle music)

330
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,166
Have to eat candy corns

331
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,877
on the way home from the show.

332
00:15:13,877 --> 00:15:15,169
(Chel giggling)

333
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:16,712
Perfect moon.

334
00:15:16,712 --> 00:15:17,796
What do you say,

335
00:15:17,796 --> 00:15:19,089
we go up to Temple Hill and we watch it?

336
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:21,466
I haven't done that since I was a kid.

337
00:15:21,466 --> 00:15:23,467
- I used to do that with my sister.

338
00:15:23,467 --> 00:15:25,636
We'd make wishes on the stars.

339
00:15:25,636 --> 00:15:27,095
- What'd you wish for?

340
00:15:27,095 --> 00:15:27,929
- I can't tell you what you wish for,

341
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:29,722
it won't come true.

342
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:30,598
- Well, let's go.

343
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:33,600
- Where?
- Up to Temple Hill

344
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,060
to look at the moon.

345
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,562
- We can't, they keep the
gates locked at night.

346
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,730
- That ever stop you and your sister?

347
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,564
- No.

348
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,983
But I just don't think I should.

349
00:15:44,651 --> 00:15:45,485
- Jens won't mind.

350
00:15:45,485 --> 00:15:46,528
I'm practically your brother now.

351
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:47,654
Isn't that what he said?

352
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,405
Let's go.

353
00:15:49,405 --> 00:15:52,908
(bright orchestral music)

354
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,745
- [Chel] All the places you've
been, things you've seen,

355
00:16:00,289 --> 00:16:01,915
even the war.

356
00:16:01,915 --> 00:16:03,624
- [Erik] Two years I wanna forget.

357
00:16:05,251 --> 00:16:07,002
- Jens feels guilty sometimes

358
00:16:07,002 --> 00:16:08,503
'cause he was too young to go.

359
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:11,673
He told me you were wounded.

360
00:16:11,673 --> 00:16:13,507
- Wanna see?

361
00:16:13,507 --> 00:16:16,635
(crickets chirping)

362
00:16:16,635 --> 00:16:18,219
Still packing some of the lead.

363
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:21,806
The shrapnel went in
too close to the heart

364
00:16:21,806 --> 00:16:22,640
to get it out.

365
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,643
I laid for two days in the
Belleau Wood, bleeding.

366
00:16:26,643 --> 00:16:30,021
Lost two of my half brothers
over there in those trees.

367
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:31,397
Lost some good buddies, too.

368
00:16:33,106 --> 00:16:34,399
- I've seen death, too.

369
00:16:36,818 --> 00:16:39,903
I held my mother's hand when
she was dying of influenza.

370
00:16:41,738 --> 00:16:43,364
The way I see it, God needed her.

371
00:16:44,365 --> 00:16:45,908
It's part of his plan.

372
00:16:45,908 --> 00:16:47,993
- Yeah, nothing was ever that tidy for me.

373
00:16:49,536 --> 00:16:50,829
I mean, even in my dreams.

374
00:16:52,956 --> 00:16:55,541
All my life,

375
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:57,417
they always taught me that nothing

376
00:16:57,417 --> 00:17:00,045
was as good as life was here in Templeton.

377
00:17:00,045 --> 00:17:00,878
I mean, they even said.

378
00:17:00,878 --> 00:17:03,464
They said that the world will come here.

379
00:17:03,464 --> 00:17:06,258
It's hard when you discover
that that's not true.

380
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,927
There's a whole other
world out there, Chel.

381
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:10,178
And it's not coming here.

382
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,471
- You smoke?

383
00:17:12,471 --> 00:17:14,098
- I'm a heathen, Chel.

384
00:17:14,098 --> 00:17:18,768
I even drink tea, and,
hold your breath, coffee.

385
00:17:18,768 --> 00:17:20,394
(lighter clicking)

386
00:17:20,394 --> 00:17:21,604
- Don't make fun of me.

387
00:17:21,604 --> 00:17:22,813
- I don't mean to.

388
00:17:25,232 --> 00:17:28,442
Maybe, maybe I'm just jealous.
(light romantic music)

389
00:17:28,442 --> 00:17:29,901
Maybe I wish I could believe,

390
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:34,030
have faith in some one thing.

391
00:17:35,531 --> 00:17:36,366
Anything.

392
00:17:38,868 --> 00:17:40,410
- Everybody knows you're different.

393
00:17:41,703 --> 00:17:43,162
You've been out in the world.

394
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,123
- You ever wanna be out in the world?

395
00:17:46,123 --> 00:17:46,957
- Oh no.

396
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:50,210
I could never live any place but here.

397
00:17:55,422 --> 00:17:57,465
- Mr. Bowen, goodnight.

398
00:17:57,465 --> 00:17:59,967
Goodnight, Chel.
- Goodnight.

399
00:17:59,967 --> 00:18:01,093
- Goodnight.

400
00:18:01,093 --> 00:18:04,971
(bright piano music)

401
00:18:04,971 --> 00:18:06,265
Seems like a pleasant boy.

402
00:18:07,306 --> 00:18:09,850
I don't know why Ida
worries about him so much.

403
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,728
Doesn't hurt the young to
have a mind of their own.

404
00:18:12,728 --> 00:18:14,312
They come around sooner or later.

405
00:18:15,938 --> 00:18:18,065
Well, I better turn the
water into the corn.

406
00:18:18,065 --> 00:18:19,233
Water the lawn good and wet,

407
00:18:19,233 --> 00:18:21,026
get that dry place by the fence.

408
00:18:21,026 --> 00:18:24,529
(bright orchestral music)

409
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,292
(lighter clicking)

410
00:18:40,292 --> 00:18:42,960
(melodic piano)

411
00:18:54,844 --> 00:18:55,679
- Chel.

412
00:18:58,097 --> 00:19:00,641
(engine puttering)

413
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:03,685
- Brought you and daddy some fresh eggs.

414
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,395
I hate gathering them. (chuckling)

415
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,063
Chickens are disgusting.

416
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,522
You can't touch 'em.

417
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:09,690
They all have mites.

418
00:19:11,858 --> 00:19:13,318
Now.

419
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,902
Tell me about the piano lessons.

420
00:19:15,861 --> 00:19:18,655
- Oh, well he's a wonderful teacher.

421
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,157
He really is.

422
00:19:20,157 --> 00:19:24,077
He's just teaching me so much
about music and technique.

423
00:19:24,077 --> 00:19:26,662
Things that Seenie could never teach me.

424
00:19:26,662 --> 00:19:29,414
- Daddy says you're
practicing all the time.

425
00:19:29,414 --> 00:19:30,582
- It's a wonderful opportunity.

426
00:19:30,582 --> 00:19:31,999
I wanna make the most of it.

427
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,376
- I'd be sweatin' so bad,

428
00:19:34,376 --> 00:19:36,503
my fingers would slide right off the keys.

429
00:19:38,129 --> 00:19:39,130
- I have to confess,

430
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,257
my fingers have been sliding a little

431
00:19:41,257 --> 00:19:42,883
(Esther chuckling)

432
00:19:42,883 --> 00:19:43,801
It's his eyes.

433
00:19:44,676 --> 00:19:46,345
The way he looks at me.

434
00:19:46,345 --> 00:19:50,431
- Yeah, he sees right
down to your underwear.

435
00:19:50,431 --> 00:19:51,474
- Esther.

436
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:53,141
(light orchestral music)

437
00:19:53,141 --> 00:19:54,392
What time is it?

438
00:19:54,392 --> 00:19:57,019
- Honey, I'm hurrying, but
these things take time.

439
00:19:57,019 --> 00:19:58,729
- It's almost 3:30.

440
00:19:58,729 --> 00:20:00,606
- Oh, I'm gonna have to lower this hem

441
00:20:00,606 --> 00:20:01,982
by at least two inches.

442
00:20:01,982 --> 00:20:03,233
- I don't wanna be late
for my piano lesson.

443
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:05,735
- Mama had the tiniest waist.

444
00:20:05,735 --> 00:20:07,319
I can't believe you can get in it.

445
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:08,988
Goodness knows I tried.

446
00:20:11,656 --> 00:20:13,407
Uh, it's Jens.

447
00:20:13,407 --> 00:20:15,534
- C'mon, honey, turn around.
- Oh, no.

448
00:20:15,534 --> 00:20:16,369
- [Esther] Go away.

449
00:20:16,369 --> 00:20:17,620
You're not supposed to see her.

450
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,329
- How about I close my eyes?

451
00:20:19,329 --> 00:20:22,498
- Oh, you can't see her.
- Come on, it's bad luck.

452
00:20:22,498 --> 00:20:23,540
- Your dad says you was getting fit.

453
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,417
- Jens, stop, I'm in a hurry.

454
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:27,377
- Years ago, there was a Beale girl,

455
00:20:27,377 --> 00:20:30,005
her fiance was a Henderson from Gunnison,

456
00:20:30,005 --> 00:20:32,089
and he saw her in her wedding dress,

457
00:20:32,089 --> 00:20:34,133
and two days later, she died.

458
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:36,968
She got a piece of fried
liver stuck in her throat.

459
00:20:36,968 --> 00:20:40,304
- Well, Chel hates fried
liver, so don't worry.

460
00:20:40,304 --> 00:20:41,138
Excuse me.

461
00:20:41,138 --> 00:20:42,890
- Oh, Jens.
- Jens,

462
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:43,891
- Come on.
- Stop.

463
00:20:43,891 --> 00:20:45,058
Come on now.

464
00:20:45,058 --> 00:20:46,851
You're stepping on my hem.

465
00:20:46,851 --> 00:20:49,186
Now, I'm already late
for my piano lesson, get.

466
00:20:49,186 --> 00:20:50,062
- Come on, honey, turn around.
- That's it.

467
00:20:50,062 --> 00:20:51,897
- Don't, goodbye.
- Come on.

468
00:20:53,148 --> 00:20:56,233
(bright piano music)

469
00:21:10,328 --> 00:21:11,162
- No.

470
00:21:11,162 --> 00:21:12,038
No, you're forcing it.

471
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:14,748
You hear it, but you don't understand it.

472
00:21:14,748 --> 00:21:15,999
Now, give me your hand.

473
00:21:17,626 --> 00:21:19,377
The tip of the finger

474
00:21:19,377 --> 00:21:22,755
reaches the key for what
the music wants right here.

475
00:21:24,673 --> 00:21:26,049
It's a bent finger touch.

476
00:21:26,883 --> 00:21:28,634
- Yes, bent finger.

477
00:21:29,635 --> 00:21:31,554
- And here, the lento.

478
00:21:32,596 --> 00:21:34,222
The fleshy part of the finger.

479
00:21:35,807 --> 00:21:37,725
The flesh part reaches for the key.

480
00:21:39,226 --> 00:21:40,977
It's a clinging touch.

481
00:21:40,977 --> 00:21:43,939
- [Chel] The clinging touch.

482
00:21:43,939 --> 00:21:47,482
- See, our passions, our ideas we express,

483
00:21:47,482 --> 00:21:50,444
sees with the muscles, with the shoulders,

484
00:21:51,861 --> 00:21:55,489
the arms, the hands, and then the fingers.

485
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:00,577
And in turn, they give force to the keys.

486
00:22:00,577 --> 00:22:01,453
See, look at this.

487
00:22:02,912 --> 00:22:04,996
(bright piano music)

488
00:22:04,996 --> 00:22:05,872
Until I touch it.

489
00:22:10,168 --> 00:22:12,211
The key gives force to the hammer.

490
00:22:12,211 --> 00:22:14,213
- The hammer to the string.

491
00:22:14,213 --> 00:22:15,089
- That's right.

492
00:22:15,089 --> 00:22:16,506
Then the string vibrates,

493
00:22:16,506 --> 00:22:19,675
and at last, our force
is given to the air.

494
00:22:19,675 --> 00:22:23,929
As joy, or sorrow, anger.

495
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,514
Or love.

496
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:33,603
- I think we've run over my time.

497
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:34,729
- Okay.

498
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:36,731
- I have to get to the show.

499
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:37,565
That was good.

500
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,899
I mean, the lesson.

501
00:22:42,401 --> 00:22:45,154
- [Jens] You think I'm worried about Erik?

502
00:22:45,154 --> 00:22:47,072
- [Ivor] Women like him.

503
00:22:47,072 --> 00:22:48,490
So-called sensitive types.

504
00:22:50,575 --> 00:22:53,660
I won't say this, but just the kind.

505
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,079
- You think Chel's the kind?

506
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:55,912
- Of course not.

507
00:22:57,372 --> 00:22:59,165
One girl like that get carried away.

508
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:02,209
- I'm not worried about Chel.

509
00:23:02,209 --> 00:23:04,378
- Well, I don't trust him.

510
00:23:04,378 --> 00:23:05,212
Never have.

511
00:23:06,129 --> 00:23:06,963
Thinks he's better than us

512
00:23:06,963 --> 00:23:08,923
'cause he lived in New York City.

513
00:23:08,923 --> 00:23:11,008
Studied at the Royal College in London.

514
00:23:11,008 --> 00:23:12,300
Some such place.
(lamb baaing)

515
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,928
- He's our brother, Ivor.
(hammer pounding)

516
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:17,722
- Maybe he got some of our
blood running through him,

517
00:23:17,722 --> 00:23:18,848
but the other half is sissy.

518
00:23:18,848 --> 00:23:20,849
- Yeah, well he went away to war.

519
00:23:20,849 --> 00:23:22,684
Along with Hans and Soren.

520
00:23:22,684 --> 00:23:23,518
Almost died there with 'em.

521
00:23:23,518 --> 00:23:25,811
- You think I'm a slacker?

522
00:23:25,811 --> 00:23:26,646
I was itching to go,

523
00:23:26,646 --> 00:23:28,230
but mother had to have some--
- I know, I know.

524
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,690
You had to keep the farm
going after father died.

525
00:23:32,817 --> 00:23:34,110
- I'll tell you one thing.

526
00:23:35,403 --> 00:23:38,989
That bastard ever touch
your girl, I'd kill him.

527
00:23:39,822 --> 00:23:41,073
(Jen scoffing)

528
00:23:41,073 --> 00:23:44,493
(light orchestral music)

529
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,997
- You were in there?

530
00:23:49,997 --> 00:23:51,457
- I wanted to watch you play

531
00:23:51,457 --> 00:23:53,751
when you didn't know I was here.

532
00:23:53,751 --> 00:23:54,626
Free and loose.

533
00:23:57,546 --> 00:23:59,880
- I get carried away sometimes.

534
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,257
- You were on fire.

535
00:24:02,257 --> 00:24:04,342
Chel, that was beautiful.

536
00:24:09,555 --> 00:24:11,890
I brought candy corns.

537
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,516
(horse clopping)

538
00:24:13,516 --> 00:24:15,726
- My sister was always
kind of in love with you,

539
00:24:15,726 --> 00:24:17,186
and go to your recitals.

540
00:24:17,186 --> 00:24:18,603
She'd practically swoon.

541
00:24:19,771 --> 00:24:22,023
She says you look like a movie star.

542
00:24:22,023 --> 00:24:23,274
- Maybe I should meet your sister.

543
00:24:23,274 --> 00:24:25,276
- (chuckling) Too late.

544
00:24:25,276 --> 00:24:26,902
She's already married.

545
00:24:26,902 --> 00:24:29,654
To a farmer, Karl Dorius.

546
00:24:29,654 --> 00:24:32,824
(crickets chirping)

547
00:24:32,824 --> 00:24:36,117
- It'll make you happy,
Chel, the dairy farm?

548
00:24:36,117 --> 00:24:38,453
- If it makes Jens happy,
it'll make me happy.

549
00:24:40,288 --> 00:24:42,414
He's so excited right now.

550
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:45,292
He gets poetic talking about cows,

551
00:24:45,292 --> 00:24:47,460
and fresh butter,
(Erik chuckling)

552
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,294
eggs.

553
00:24:50,338 --> 00:24:52,548
I think it's meant to be, though.

554
00:24:52,548 --> 00:24:53,715
Part of God's plan.

555
00:24:54,716 --> 00:24:55,675
- Do you believe that?

556
00:24:56,801 --> 00:25:01,054
That God looks down on each
one of us, makes a plan.

557
00:25:01,054 --> 00:25:03,389
- Yes I do.

558
00:25:08,894 --> 00:25:12,313
(light orchestral music)

559
00:25:18,235 --> 00:25:20,903
My sister's probably waiting up.

560
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:23,823
Thank you.

561
00:25:25,949 --> 00:25:28,994
- Is that part of the plan, Chel?

562
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,036
Are you gonna be like your sister?

563
00:25:30,036 --> 00:25:32,830
Do your duty to God and
have a bunch of babies?

564
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,914
- I want babies, yes.

565
00:25:36,124 --> 00:25:38,376
I don't know about bunches.

566
00:25:40,503 --> 00:25:41,337
Goodnight.

567
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,464
- [Erik] Goodnight.

568
00:25:50,427 --> 00:25:51,512
- I'm awake, Chel.

569
00:25:56,391 --> 00:25:58,267
I thought it was Jens.

570
00:25:58,267 --> 00:25:59,684
I was about to come down in my night gown,

571
00:25:59,684 --> 00:26:02,687
and then I saw him in the porch light.

572
00:26:03,855 --> 00:26:05,023
Erik Eriksen.

573
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,440
He walked home with you.

574
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,068
Does his wife know?

575
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,403
- Esther, it's nothing like that.

576
00:26:12,403 --> 00:26:14,655
Besides, he doesn't have a wife anymore.

577
00:26:14,655 --> 00:26:17,658
- Well that's because he
had so many love affairs.

578
00:26:17,658 --> 00:26:19,534
Oh, I'll be so glad when I can sleep

579
00:26:19,534 --> 00:26:21,494
on my stomach again.

580
00:26:21,494 --> 00:26:22,953
- What do you mean, love affairs?

581
00:26:22,953 --> 00:26:24,204
- Hmm?
(train whistle blowing)

582
00:26:24,204 --> 00:26:27,582
- Well, you said Erik
Eriksen had love affairs.

583
00:26:27,582 --> 00:26:29,458
- I've heard gossip, of course.

584
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:32,753
He's the only person I
know that's been divorced.

585
00:26:32,753 --> 00:26:36,130
Anyway, he's so handsome.

586
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,840
There has to be love affairs.

587
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:41,593
I used to think that
if I knew Erik Eriksen,

588
00:26:43,219 --> 00:26:45,096
I wouldn't care if I went
to heaven when I died

589
00:26:45,096 --> 00:26:47,347
because I'd already have been there.

590
00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:51,100
- Well, I'll tell him you like him.

591
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,644
- I'm sure he'll be excited.

592
00:26:52,644 --> 00:26:54,478
Fat, old married lady me.

593
00:26:59,982 --> 00:27:02,276
You got good nipples for nursing.

594
00:27:02,276 --> 00:27:04,278
- [Chel] Esther.

595
00:27:04,278 --> 00:27:06,112
- It's a fact.

596
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,072
Mine turn in.

597
00:27:10,116 --> 00:27:12,743
So nice of Karl to let me come.

598
00:27:12,743 --> 00:27:16,120
- I wish you could stay
for the Pioneer Day Dance.

599
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,288
It doesn't seem fair.

600
00:27:19,415 --> 00:27:20,916
- My dancing days are over.

601
00:27:22,459 --> 00:27:26,087
Too much to do at the farm.
(light orchestral music)

602
00:27:26,087 --> 00:27:27,589
You know what married life is?

603
00:27:28,464 --> 00:27:29,465
Hard work.

604
00:27:31,675 --> 00:27:34,010
- It can't all be hard work.

605
00:27:34,927 --> 00:27:38,097
- No, in the beginning, it's romantic.

606
00:27:40,724 --> 00:27:42,058
Then it's hard work.

607
00:27:45,853 --> 00:27:47,479
- Do I really have good nipples?

608
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:49,939
- [Esther] (Giggling) You're built, Chel.

609
00:27:49,939 --> 00:27:51,899
(Chel giggling)
In case you didn't know it.

610
00:27:51,899 --> 00:27:54,318
(bright orchestral music)

611
00:27:54,318 --> 00:27:55,944
You're in for it, little sister.

612
00:27:57,153 --> 00:27:58,404
You just wait and see.

613
00:28:01,532 --> 00:28:03,450
You know, marriage wouldn't be so bad.

614
00:28:05,369 --> 00:28:07,161
Men just end up spoiling everything.

615
00:28:08,872 --> 00:28:10,956
- Take care, Esther.
- Thank you.

616
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:12,875
- Send me for as soon as
the pains start, okay?

617
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:14,251
- I will.
- Bye Karl.

618
00:28:14,251 --> 00:28:15,585
- Bye Chel.

619
00:28:15,585 --> 00:28:17,837
- [Esther] Oh thanks, Karl.

620
00:28:19,838 --> 00:28:22,716
- Well, you'll be married
pretty soon yourself.

621
00:28:22,716 --> 00:28:23,549
Don't know what I'm gonna do

622
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:24,967
without my two girls.

623
00:28:24,967 --> 00:28:27,344
- Oh, you'll be fine, daddy.
(car engine puttering)

624
00:28:27,344 --> 00:28:29,471
Anyway, I won't be far away.

625
00:28:29,471 --> 00:28:34,058
I'll probably be here
more than I am there.

626
00:28:34,058 --> 00:28:36,644
(upbeat music)

627
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:50,530
Jens, what will people think?

628
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:53,115
- I don't care what they think.

629
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,327
Hey, but listen, what's the matter?

630
00:28:58,327 --> 00:28:59,162
- Erik.

631
00:29:03,916 --> 00:29:05,708
(crowd clapping)
- Woo-hoo!

632
00:29:05,708 --> 00:29:07,669
- Yeah, shouldn't surprise you.

633
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:08,836
Erik likes the ladies.

634
00:29:08,836 --> 00:29:10,462
- But Ruby Snow?

635
00:29:11,297 --> 00:29:12,172
I mean.

636
00:29:12,172 --> 00:29:13,799
- Hey, why are you getting so upset?

637
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:15,466
Why do you care who he dances with?

638
00:29:15,466 --> 00:29:16,259
- I don't care.

639
00:29:17,342 --> 00:29:18,635
It's just degrading is all.

640
00:29:18,635 --> 00:29:20,970
I mean, for the family.

641
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,764
It's a small town.

642
00:29:22,764 --> 00:29:23,973
And We have to live here.

643
00:29:23,973 --> 00:29:25,391
- Chel, what the heck?

644
00:29:25,391 --> 00:29:26,725
Hey.

645
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:28,726
- Come on Jens, my turn.

646
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:44,614
(horse neighing)
(people chattering)

647
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:47,283
- Chel?

648
00:29:49,618 --> 00:29:50,744
(hand whacking against face)

649
00:29:50,744 --> 00:29:52,079
- I hate you, Erik.

650
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:54,497
- What is the matter, what did I do?

651
00:29:54,497 --> 00:29:56,874
- Making a spectacle of
yourself with Ruby Snow.

652
00:29:56,874 --> 00:29:58,167
- A spectacle?

653
00:29:58,167 --> 00:29:59,043
- Yes.

654
00:29:59,043 --> 00:30:01,002
She has a terrible reputation.

655
00:30:01,002 --> 00:30:03,171
She's got a baby and
she's not even married.

656
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,299
Besides, she's a ha--

657
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:07,466
(crowd applauding)

658
00:30:07,466 --> 00:30:09,551
- She's a half-breed, is
that what you were gonna say?

659
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,803
- No.

660
00:30:11,803 --> 00:30:13,429
- That's what happens to
people that live in this town.

661
00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:15,431
They become narrow and bigoted.

662
00:30:15,431 --> 00:30:17,641
(Chel panting)

663
00:30:17,641 --> 00:30:19,476
- [Chel] Uh, stop it.

664
00:30:19,476 --> 00:30:21,769
- It will happen to you, too.

665
00:30:21,769 --> 00:30:23,479
Your mind gets smaller and smaller.

666
00:30:23,479 --> 00:30:25,481
If you stay here, it will seep inside you,

667
00:30:25,481 --> 00:30:27,482
and shrivel you up into a little old lady.

668
00:30:27,482 --> 00:30:29,025
- Don't say that.

669
00:30:29,025 --> 00:30:31,486
I love this town, I'm not a bigot.

670
00:30:31,486 --> 00:30:35,030
I'm not.
(distant country music)

671
00:30:48,165 --> 00:30:49,833
My sister was right.

672
00:30:50,834 --> 00:30:52,293
Men spoil everything.

673
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:54,462
You spoil everything.

674
00:31:02,844 --> 00:31:05,596
(dramatic piano)

675
00:31:22,735 --> 00:31:25,904
(audience applauding)

676
00:31:27,238 --> 00:31:30,949
(audience chattering)

677
00:31:30,949 --> 00:31:32,325
Oh, Jens.

678
00:31:32,325 --> 00:31:33,160
- Well, who'd you think?

679
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,869
- Oh, you scared me is all.

680
00:31:35,703 --> 00:31:37,246
- Hey, I come to walk you home.

681
00:31:38,289 --> 00:31:40,832
- I just get so caught up in my music.

682
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,709
- I've been neglecting you lately.

683
00:31:42,709 --> 00:31:45,253
Get so wound up in that darn farm.

684
00:31:45,253 --> 00:31:47,379
Anyway, most of the heavy work's done.

685
00:31:47,379 --> 00:31:48,964
I can start being a human again.

686
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:50,840
- Thank you.

687
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,638
- I got the reservations made already.

688
00:31:58,638 --> 00:32:01,933
A bridal suite at a new
Grand Hotel in Salt Lake.

689
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:04,018
- Must've cost a pretty penny.
- Ow.

690
00:32:04,018 --> 00:32:05,269
- I'm sorry.

691
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:07,187
- You're tired, miss.

692
00:32:07,187 --> 00:32:09,480
My goodness, it's almost 11 o'clock.

693
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,357
You know, I try to tell her it's too hard.

694
00:32:11,357 --> 00:32:13,567
Getting ready for a wedding.

695
00:32:13,567 --> 00:32:15,235
All the time she puts in on her music.

696
00:32:15,235 --> 00:32:16,945
Plus playing those silly shows at night.

697
00:32:16,945 --> 00:32:17,779
- [Chel] I quit.

698
00:32:19,113 --> 00:32:20,198
- Your piano lessons?

699
00:32:21,156 --> 00:32:23,491
- Of course not my piano lessons.

700
00:32:23,491 --> 00:32:24,492
I got the recital coming up.

701
00:32:24,492 --> 00:32:26,328
I quit the shows.

702
00:32:26,328 --> 00:32:28,537
Told Bill Mac this afternoon.

703
00:32:28,537 --> 00:32:30,872
He's got that Elden boy who can play.

704
00:32:30,872 --> 00:32:31,707
- Good.

705
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:35,668
There's plenty enough
to do up at the farm.

706
00:32:35,668 --> 00:32:38,963
(train whistle blowing)

707
00:32:38,963 --> 00:32:40,422
- Made some pie this morning.

708
00:32:41,798 --> 00:32:43,174
- You're getting quite a cook, Jens.

709
00:32:43,174 --> 00:32:45,468
- Well sir, just so you know,

710
00:32:45,468 --> 00:32:47,636
I'm not marrying your
daughter for her pie crust.

711
00:32:47,636 --> 00:32:50,388
(John laughing)

712
00:32:50,388 --> 00:32:51,931
(light orchestral music)

713
00:32:51,931 --> 00:32:55,476
(chuckling) To think, I
almost married Paulene Cox.

714
00:32:55,476 --> 00:32:57,143
(Chel chuckling)

715
00:32:57,143 --> 00:32:58,519
- Her father raises dairy cows.

716
00:32:58,519 --> 00:32:59,937
It would've all fit perfect.

717
00:33:01,272 --> 00:33:03,774
- You're the only girl for me, Chel.

718
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:04,858
The only one.

719
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,112
God just ordained it, I know he did.

720
00:33:12,072 --> 00:33:13,406
I'm glad you quit Bill Mac.

721
00:33:14,491 --> 00:33:17,159
I didn't like it, Erik
walking you home all the time.

722
00:33:18,035 --> 00:33:21,330
It made me feel a little jealous, I guess.

723
00:33:22,372 --> 00:33:24,457
- No cause to be jealous.

724
00:33:27,126 --> 00:33:29,919
- Sometimes I wonder what
you and Erik talk about.

725
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,130
- Nothing really.

726
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,840
Just music.

727
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,341
- Kinda wish I could
talk to you like he does.

728
00:33:35,341 --> 00:33:38,010
All about music and the like.

729
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,308
- Don't be silly.

730
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:50,020
I'll come up to the house
tomorrow and help you paint.

731
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,062
- Well, just as well as it stopped,

732
00:33:53,856 --> 00:33:54,939
Erik walking you home.

733
00:34:02,445 --> 00:34:07,449
(lambs baaing)
(dog barking)

734
00:34:10,161 --> 00:34:11,244
(gun firing)

735
00:34:11,244 --> 00:34:16,248
(horse neighing)
(lambs baaing)

736
00:34:16,624 --> 00:34:18,292
(thunder rumbling)

737
00:34:18,292 --> 00:34:19,876
- Let's go get him.

738
00:34:21,085 --> 00:34:22,420
(horse neighing)

739
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,922
- What happened?

740
00:34:23,922 --> 00:34:26,549
- Mongrel killed one of
Ivor's lambs last night.

741
00:34:26,549 --> 00:34:27,841
- That's cause it was starving.

742
00:34:27,841 --> 00:34:29,009
Did you see it, so thin.

743
00:34:29,009 --> 00:34:29,884
- Hey Chel, Chel,

744
00:34:29,884 --> 00:34:30,843
nothing to get so upset about.

745
00:34:30,843 --> 00:34:33,345
It was a stray, mongrel.

746
00:34:33,345 --> 00:34:34,180
- We could've fed it.

747
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,473
It would've left him alone
if we would've fed it.

748
00:34:36,473 --> 00:34:37,808
- Once they start killing sheep,

749
00:34:37,808 --> 00:34:39,225
there's no way stopping 'em.

750
00:34:39,225 --> 00:34:42,311
(lambs baaing)

751
00:34:42,311 --> 00:34:44,146
- You poor pup.

752
00:34:44,146 --> 00:34:45,689
- [Ivor] Don't touch him.

753
00:34:45,689 --> 00:34:47,273
No telling what he's got on him.

754
00:34:48,775 --> 00:34:50,276
- How could you do that?

755
00:34:50,276 --> 00:34:51,527
So brutal, a little dog.

756
00:34:51,527 --> 00:34:53,653
- It had to be done,
he's eating all my lambs.

757
00:34:53,653 --> 00:34:54,862
Go get a shovel, brother.

758
00:34:54,862 --> 00:34:56,739
Let's bury this carcass.

759
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:59,283
Might have an owner come a lookin'.

760
00:34:59,283 --> 00:35:00,617
- Guns.

761
00:35:00,617 --> 00:35:01,702
I just hate guns.

762
00:35:02,619 --> 00:35:06,246
- Chel, you want a dog,
I'll get you a real dog.

763
00:35:06,246 --> 00:35:08,248
(lambs baaing)
(cows mooing)

764
00:35:08,248 --> 00:35:11,501
(dramatic piano music)

765
00:35:38,731 --> 00:35:40,108
- What do you think?

766
00:35:40,108 --> 00:35:41,066
- It was beautiful.

767
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,944
But terrible.

768
00:35:43,944 --> 00:35:46,779
- Yes, it was beautiful and terrible.

769
00:35:46,779 --> 00:35:48,405
Both.

770
00:35:48,405 --> 00:35:50,657
Not only pleasant things
are beautiful, Chel.

771
00:35:53,534 --> 00:35:55,078
I didn't think you were coming.

772
00:35:56,078 --> 00:35:56,996
- I'm late, is all.

773
00:35:58,163 --> 00:36:00,207
I wouldn't just quit without telling you.

774
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,805
(bright piano music)

775
00:36:23,267 --> 00:36:25,060
(sighing)

776
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,645
I had this perfect this morning.

777
00:36:27,896 --> 00:36:28,897
- Perfect fingering.

778
00:36:29,897 --> 00:36:31,440
But the feeling you miss.

779
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:35,402
(bright piano music)

780
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,907
(bright piano music)

781
00:36:45,826 --> 00:36:46,744
What's the matter?

782
00:36:49,038 --> 00:36:49,871
Shh.

783
00:36:52,498 --> 00:36:55,251
(Chel sniffling)

784
00:36:56,209 --> 00:36:57,294
- This town.

785
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,213
(sighing)

786
00:37:00,213 --> 00:37:02,131
They're good people, I know they are.

787
00:37:05,009 --> 00:37:06,385
Except.

788
00:37:06,385 --> 00:37:07,343
- I know they are.

789
00:37:09,179 --> 00:37:10,013
Chel.

790
00:37:13,557 --> 00:37:14,391
I know.

791
00:37:16,393 --> 00:37:17,936
- No you don't know.

792
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:18,770
Nobody knows.

793
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,438
- I know I love you.

794
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:23,398
- I'm marrying your brother
in a couple of weeks.

795
00:37:23,398 --> 00:37:24,357
Jens would never do that.

796
00:37:24,357 --> 00:37:25,775
He would never touch me like that.

797
00:37:25,775 --> 00:37:27,318
- My God, if you two are so much in love,

798
00:37:27,318 --> 00:37:28,778
what are you waiting for?

799
00:37:28,778 --> 00:37:30,654
The millennium, Armageddon, what?

800
00:37:32,238 --> 00:37:33,656
I thought you wanted me to kiss you.

801
00:37:33,656 --> 00:37:35,158
I thought you wanted me to touch you.

802
00:37:35,158 --> 00:37:37,827
I thought that you wanted
it as much as I did.

803
00:37:37,827 --> 00:37:40,120
We are different than the
people in this town, Chel.

804
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,913
Can't you see that?

805
00:37:41,913 --> 00:37:44,707
Jens said that I was
dropped here out of the sky.

806
00:37:44,707 --> 00:37:46,208
So were you Chel, so were you.

807
00:37:48,626 --> 00:37:50,295
I walk up Temple Hill every night,

808
00:37:50,295 --> 00:37:51,796
and I watch your light go out.

809
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:55,799
And I keep thinking that
sometime you might come.

810
00:37:59,885 --> 00:38:01,679
Don't marry him, Chel!

811
00:38:03,055 --> 00:38:04,514
Don't!

812
00:38:04,514 --> 00:38:06,558
(door slamming)

813
00:38:06,558 --> 00:38:10,103
(birds chirping)

814
00:38:10,103 --> 00:38:12,354
- Oh, I should've been there.

815
00:38:12,354 --> 00:38:14,272
- We managed just fine.

816
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,482
Pretty little baby girl.

817
00:38:16,733 --> 00:38:17,650
- Thank goodness it's over,

818
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:18,692
and everybody's okay.

819
00:38:20,569 --> 00:38:22,529
Thank goodness it's over.

820
00:38:22,529 --> 00:38:23,363
All of it.

821
00:38:24,364 --> 00:38:25,781
(chickens clucking)
(baby whining)

822
00:38:25,781 --> 00:38:27,700
- Are you happy, Chel?

823
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,658
You've been here almost a week,

824
00:38:28,658 --> 00:38:30,952
and you never talk about him.
(chickens sounding)

825
00:38:30,952 --> 00:38:31,953
- About who?

826
00:38:31,953 --> 00:38:34,788
- Your future husband, who do you think?

827
00:38:34,788 --> 00:38:36,248
Aren't you in love with Jens?

828
00:38:37,124 --> 00:38:37,958
You can tell me.

829
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:40,668
- Esther, of course I'm in love with Jens.

830
00:38:40,668 --> 00:38:41,628
- I mean, you don't act like a girl

831
00:38:41,628 --> 00:38:43,254
who's getting married in a few weeks.

832
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:45,256
- How am I supposed to act?

833
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:46,465
My word.

834
00:38:46,465 --> 00:38:47,966
- You remember how I was with Karl?

835
00:38:47,966 --> 00:38:49,717
I couldn't stop talking about him.

836
00:38:49,717 --> 00:38:51,051
He was always on my mind.

837
00:38:52,011 --> 00:38:54,971
Seems like I was always
worked up into a hot sweat.

838
00:38:54,971 --> 00:38:56,890
- Well maybe I'm not you.

839
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:58,224
Maybe I'm different.

840
00:38:58,224 --> 00:38:59,392
You ever think of that?

841
00:39:00,934 --> 00:39:02,394
Maybe I'm just not the kind to talk about

842
00:39:02,394 --> 00:39:03,686
what's always on my mind.

843
00:39:04,604 --> 00:39:07,481
- You used to be, with me.

844
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:08,816
- Since you ran off and left me,

845
00:39:08,816 --> 00:39:10,734
I've gotten used to talking to myself.

846
00:39:12,736 --> 00:39:15,030
(light dramatic music)

847
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:16,406
There's some poppies
blooming up by the road.

848
00:39:16,406 --> 00:39:17,948
I'm gonna go fix a big bouquet.

849
00:39:17,948 --> 00:39:20,700
(baby crying)

850
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:24,370
(dramatic orchestral music)

851
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:45,012
(Chel crying)

852
00:39:46,263 --> 00:39:47,847
- Alright everybody, get a wiggle on now.

853
00:39:47,847 --> 00:39:49,307
We've got to get this picture made quick

854
00:39:49,307 --> 00:39:50,808
before the food gets cold.
- Yes.

855
00:39:50,808 --> 00:39:51,767
- [Christine] Now we are going

856
00:39:51,767 --> 00:39:53,018
to be late for the recital.
- Come on now.

857
00:39:53,018 --> 00:39:55,062
- [Christine] Back, little
people in the front.

858
00:39:55,062 --> 00:39:58,689
Alright, somebody get a chair
for Aunt Mary, right there.

859
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:00,107
Right there, Aunt Mary.

860
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:02,984
Alright, come on,
everybody, sit down here.

861
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:04,277
Alright, come on, Alex.
(group chattering)

862
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:05,736
You sit right over here.

863
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:08,655
You, you two, come on,
you're in this, too.

864
00:40:08,655 --> 00:40:09,573
- No, Christine.

865
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,740
Not me, just Erik.

866
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,993
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.

867
00:40:13,993 --> 00:40:16,954
Ida, my goodness, we go
through this every time.

868
00:40:16,954 --> 00:40:20,582
Now when Lars was told to take
another wife to take care of,

869
00:40:20,582 --> 00:40:23,751
he said if it was his
duty before God, he would.

870
00:40:23,751 --> 00:40:25,294
And he did.

871
00:40:25,294 --> 00:40:27,838
Now if he was still alive,

872
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:30,298
he'd be sitting right here
between us, his two wives.

873
00:40:30,298 --> 00:40:31,966
(car horn honking)
All right everybody.

874
00:40:31,966 --> 00:40:33,092
Sit up straight, children.

875
00:40:33,092 --> 00:40:33,926
Come on, Rebecca, come back here

876
00:40:33,926 --> 00:40:35,969
and sit with us, come on.

877
00:40:35,969 --> 00:40:37,220
Come over this way, honey.

878
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:40,931
Well it's about time
that you two got here.

879
00:40:40,931 --> 00:40:42,349
- Yeah, we're not late, mother.

880
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:44,017
You're early.
- Come on up here.

881
00:40:45,893 --> 00:40:47,353
Chel.

882
00:40:47,353 --> 00:40:49,355
You're not wearing your wedding dress.

883
00:40:49,355 --> 00:40:52,023
- Oh, Chel doesn't believe
in all that hocus pocus.

884
00:40:52,023 --> 00:40:53,649
Anyway, I already seen her in it.

885
00:40:54,775 --> 00:40:57,319
- Well, Chelnicia, you
look just like an angel.

886
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:01,155
Look at her, she looks just like an angel.

887
00:41:01,155 --> 00:41:02,782
- You had better face it.

888
00:41:02,782 --> 00:41:05,034
People are gonna talk.

889
00:41:05,034 --> 00:41:06,910
- It was my mother's dress.

890
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:07,911
I think that she would've wanted me

891
00:41:07,911 --> 00:41:08,996
to wear it for today.

892
00:41:09,996 --> 00:41:11,664
- Well I don't think she could have looked

893
00:41:11,664 --> 00:41:13,582
any more beautiful than her daughter.

894
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:16,335
My goodness.

895
00:41:16,335 --> 00:41:17,961
Sure fits.

896
00:41:17,961 --> 00:41:20,838
Alright, somebody get a chair for Chel.

897
00:41:20,838 --> 00:41:22,548
Alright everybody, sit up straight now.

898
00:41:22,548 --> 00:41:24,008
We've got to get this made,

899
00:41:24,008 --> 00:41:26,885
so we can eat and do the
dishes before the recital.

900
00:41:26,885 --> 00:41:28,344
- I don't think I belong in it yet.

901
00:41:28,344 --> 00:41:30,054
- Oh of course you do, darling.

902
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:32,305
- In two weeks, you'll be Mrs. Eriksen.

903
00:41:32,305 --> 00:41:35,058
(birds chirping)

904
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,021
- [Camera Man] Alright everybody.

905
00:41:40,021 --> 00:41:42,147
Now think of Christmas, kids.

906
00:41:42,147 --> 00:41:43,648
Smile.

907
00:41:43,648 --> 00:41:44,899
(flash bulb bursting)

908
00:41:44,899 --> 00:41:47,902
(light piano music)

909
00:41:54,657 --> 00:41:55,741
- She's very good, too.

910
00:41:55,741 --> 00:41:58,660
- Oh, and she's doing unbelievable.

911
00:42:21,387 --> 00:42:24,556
(audience applauding)

912
00:42:26,516 --> 00:42:27,559
- Thank you, Seenie.

913
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:29,060
Our next performer will be Chel Bowen.

914
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:32,187
She'll play a piece by
Massenet from the opera Thais.

915
00:42:37,482 --> 00:42:40,069
(man coughing)

916
00:42:41,235 --> 00:42:44,322
(bright piano music)

917
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,350
Good, good.

918
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:21,768
(audience applauding)

919
00:43:21,768 --> 00:43:22,936
- [Man] Bravo.

920
00:43:24,937 --> 00:43:25,730
Bravo.

921
00:43:28,065 --> 00:43:30,859
- Wasn't she wonderful?
(crowd chattering)

922
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:31,693
- I'll tell you what.

923
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:34,278
Best darn piano player I
ever seen or heard about.

924
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,571
- Splendid.

925
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,280
Chel, you were just splendid.

926
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,198
- I wanna see you.

927
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:39,032
I have to.

928
00:43:41,451 --> 00:43:43,369
- Well, wasn't she wonderful?
- Oh it was wonderful.

929
00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:44,911
They were all so good.

930
00:43:44,911 --> 00:43:47,288
Thank you so much.
- Better than anybody.

931
00:43:47,288 --> 00:43:48,832
- Crystal Springs.

932
00:43:48,832 --> 00:43:52,793
(crowd chattering and laughing)

933
00:43:52,793 --> 00:43:53,836
Mother.

934
00:43:53,836 --> 00:43:55,212
- Yes, oh, we'll see you later.

935
00:43:55,212 --> 00:43:56,170
- Goodbye.

936
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:58,214
- Erik, good work.

937
00:43:58,214 --> 00:43:59,132
- [Ivor] I think you played better

938
00:43:59,132 --> 00:44:00,341
than Erik.
- Yeah, I think you're right.

939
00:44:00,341 --> 00:44:02,425
- I think she did.
(crowd chattering)

940
00:44:02,425 --> 00:44:04,302
- [Woman] I'd have done
better if I had worn

941
00:44:04,302 --> 00:44:05,553
my old black dress.

942
00:44:05,553 --> 00:44:08,180
You never can trust what
you get from a catalog.

943
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,850
(dramatic orchestral music)

944
00:44:32,491 --> 00:44:35,161
(water rushing)

945
00:44:39,955 --> 00:44:42,750
- I've been trying to fight it.

946
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:45,460
I just couldn't anymore.

947
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:48,004
- You're not alone in this.

948
00:44:48,004 --> 00:44:49,505
I'll go with you.

949
00:44:49,505 --> 00:44:50,881
Right now, at Christine's.

950
00:44:50,881 --> 00:44:52,424
We'll tell everyone.
- No.

951
00:44:52,424 --> 00:44:53,258
Erik, no.

952
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:56,844
Jens is so good.

953
00:45:00,222 --> 00:45:01,640
The family will hate me.

954
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,516
- No.
- My father.

955
00:45:03,516 --> 00:45:05,351
- No, we'll do it together.

956
00:45:05,351 --> 00:45:06,936
Then we'll head out across the continent

957
00:45:06,936 --> 00:45:08,979
on the train to New York.

958
00:45:08,979 --> 00:45:11,230
So many things I wanna show you, Chel.

959
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:13,066
- Erik, this is all I've ever known.

960
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,151
This town.

961
00:45:16,151 --> 00:45:17,277
The church.

962
00:45:21,614 --> 00:45:23,657
All I've ever wanted
since I was a little girl

963
00:45:23,657 --> 00:45:25,242
was to be married in the temple,

964
00:45:26,285 --> 00:45:28,119
and settle down and have children,

965
00:45:29,537 --> 00:45:30,746
and grow old and die.

966
00:45:32,957 --> 00:45:35,000
I guess it was just part of the plan.

967
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,168
- It's still part of the plan.

968
00:45:38,002 --> 00:45:39,087
It's part of our plan.

969
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:42,422
And we'll have children.

970
00:45:42,422 --> 00:45:45,342
(dramatic orchestral music)

971
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:47,802
We'll even grow old together.

972
00:45:51,763 --> 00:45:54,849
- Oh my God, how do I live with this?

973
00:45:58,435 --> 00:46:00,937
- You're my wife already Chel.

974
00:46:01,813 --> 00:46:03,147
And you know it.

975
00:46:05,941 --> 00:46:07,192
You're my wife.

976
00:46:08,568 --> 00:46:09,736
And what am I?

977
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:12,154
Say it, Chel.

978
00:46:13,072 --> 00:46:13,948
Say it.

979
00:46:16,199 --> 00:46:18,284
- You're my husband.

980
00:46:18,284 --> 00:46:19,202
My husband.

981
00:46:23,163 --> 00:46:25,790
(crickets chirping)

982
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:29,293
- I'll go with you first thing
in the morning to tell Jens.

983
00:46:29,293 --> 00:46:30,836
- No.

984
00:46:30,836 --> 00:46:32,129
I have to tell him myself.

985
00:46:33,463 --> 00:46:35,340
I owe him that much.

986
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:36,299
- But you'll get your things packed

987
00:46:36,299 --> 00:46:37,842
so we can leave tomorrow night?

988
00:46:37,842 --> 00:46:38,675
- Yes.

989
00:46:40,219 --> 00:46:41,052
I'll be ready.

990
00:46:42,638 --> 00:46:46,516
Just please, don't tell
anyone until I tell Jens.

991
00:46:46,516 --> 00:46:47,349
- Okay.

992
00:46:48,475 --> 00:46:50,644
Don't be frightened, Chel.

993
00:46:50,644 --> 00:46:51,603
This is a little place.

994
00:46:51,603 --> 00:46:53,855
It's not much of the world.
(light piano music)

995
00:46:53,855 --> 00:46:56,106
You just happened to have been born here.

996
00:46:57,525 --> 00:46:59,359
You'll bring your mountains with you.

997
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:06,532
Promise me that nothing is gonna stop us.

998
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:07,824
- Nothing's gonna stop us.

999
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,952
I don't care anymore
what they say or think.

1000
00:47:48,731 --> 00:47:50,233
- Thank you, Lord.

1001
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:52,401
Thank you.

1002
00:47:55,737 --> 00:47:56,572
Yes!

1003
00:47:59,407 --> 00:48:00,325
- Oh, Lord.

1004
00:48:01,367 --> 00:48:03,368
Wilt thou redeem my soul?

1005
00:48:04,911 --> 00:48:07,330
Wilt thou make me that I may shake

1006
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:08,664
at the appearance of sin?

1007
00:48:10,833 --> 00:48:13,168
That I may walk in the
path of the low valley.

1008
00:48:15,587 --> 00:48:17,964
That I may be strong on the plain road.

1009
00:48:21,925 --> 00:48:23,593
- Do you feel alright, Chel?

1010
00:48:23,593 --> 00:48:25,053
You look a little pekid.

1011
00:48:25,053 --> 00:48:26,971
- I'm fine.
(rooster crowing)

1012
00:48:26,971 --> 00:48:28,722
All the excitement, I guess.

1013
00:48:28,722 --> 00:48:30,015
(distant car honking)

1014
00:48:30,015 --> 00:48:31,725
- I'm sure gonna miss
our breakfasts together.

1015
00:48:31,725 --> 00:48:33,434
Once you're a married lady.

1016
00:48:34,893 --> 00:48:36,228
- Me too, Daddy.

1017
00:48:42,984 --> 00:48:45,527
(rooster crowing)

1018
00:48:45,527 --> 00:48:46,653
Daddy.

1019
00:48:46,653 --> 00:48:47,487
- Hmm?

1020
00:48:54,951 --> 00:48:56,870
- You and Mama were so much in love.

1021
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:01,081
So maybe you can understand this.

1022
00:49:03,458 --> 00:49:05,502
It's kind of difficult to explain.

1023
00:49:07,419 --> 00:49:08,254
But,

1024
00:49:10,506 --> 00:49:13,299
I feel that way too about somebody.

1025
00:49:13,299 --> 00:49:16,261
- Chel, I think I know
what you're trying to say.

1026
00:49:16,261 --> 00:49:17,720
And I understand.

1027
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:21,265
It's just natural to feel a little guilty.

1028
00:49:21,265 --> 00:49:24,183
You should love Jens
more than you love me.

1029
00:49:24,183 --> 00:49:26,644
He's gonna be your partner forever.

1030
00:49:26,644 --> 00:49:28,311
It doesn't take anything away from what

1031
00:49:28,311 --> 00:49:29,229
we feel for each other.

1032
00:49:29,229 --> 00:49:31,648
- Daddy, that's not--
- And I couldn't ask

1033
00:49:31,648 --> 00:49:33,190
for a better son-in-law.

1034
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:34,816
Jens is a fine young man.

1035
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:40,155
You know, you've made me very happy.

1036
00:49:42,322 --> 00:49:43,991
Ever since the day you were born.

1037
00:49:46,785 --> 00:49:49,537
(birds chirping)

1038
00:49:51,246 --> 00:49:52,205
Come on, eat up.

1039
00:49:52,205 --> 00:49:54,082
Put some color in your cheeks.

1040
00:49:56,251 --> 00:49:59,211
(light music)

1041
00:49:59,211 --> 00:50:00,254
This is good.

1042
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:17,267
- [Seenie] Ivor, Sarah.

1043
00:50:17,267 --> 00:50:18,977
Wait for me.

1044
00:50:18,977 --> 00:50:20,978
- [Ivor] Hurry up, then.

1045
00:50:22,229 --> 00:50:24,356
- Seenie, what is it?

1046
00:50:24,356 --> 00:50:25,857
- [Seenie] There's a body in the river.

1047
00:50:25,857 --> 00:50:28,609
They found a body in the river, let's go.

1048
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:32,279
(dramatic orchestral music)

1049
00:51:04,222 --> 00:51:05,598
- Daddy, what happened?

1050
00:51:05,598 --> 00:51:06,890
- Come here, you don't want to see this.

1051
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:07,766
- Who is it?

1052
00:51:07,766 --> 00:51:09,142
- Wells Thursby found her this morning

1053
00:51:09,142 --> 00:51:11,143
when he was fixing to take his water turn.

1054
00:51:15,022 --> 00:51:16,440
- [Chel] Ruby Snow.

1055
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,566
- Found her baby in the saw grass.

1056
00:51:18,566 --> 00:51:20,776
- No, not her baby, too.

1057
00:51:20,776 --> 00:51:22,236
Not her baby.

1058
00:51:22,236 --> 00:51:23,821
- Now don't get all upset, Chel.

1059
00:51:27,406 --> 00:51:28,992
- [John] Chel.

1060
00:51:28,992 --> 00:51:29,825
Chel.

1061
00:51:34,996 --> 00:51:39,041
(train whistle blowing)

1062
00:51:39,041 --> 00:51:42,711
(dramatic orchestral music)

1063
00:51:55,096 --> 00:51:55,929
- Jens.

1064
00:51:58,807 --> 00:52:00,183
Jens.

1065
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:01,017
- Chel?

1066
00:52:02,685 --> 00:52:04,186
- Ruby Snow.

1067
00:52:04,186 --> 00:52:06,397
She drowned herself and her baby.

1068
00:52:06,397 --> 00:52:08,648
- Oh no, oh Chel.

1069
00:52:08,648 --> 00:52:10,650
Why on Earth would she
do a thing like that?

1070
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:12,151
- I don't know, Jens.

1071
00:52:12,151 --> 00:52:13,568
Jens.

1072
00:52:13,568 --> 00:52:14,944
Oh, I want--

1073
00:52:14,944 --> 00:52:16,321
- What?

1074
00:52:16,321 --> 00:52:17,196
- You.

1075
00:52:17,196 --> 00:52:18,990
I wanna get married.

1076
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:22,117
- (chuckling) Now, wait a minute.

1077
00:52:22,117 --> 00:52:23,493
What's this got to do with Ruby Snow?

1078
00:52:23,493 --> 00:52:25,245
- I don't wanna end up like her.

1079
00:52:26,454 --> 00:52:27,288
Desperate, crazy.

1080
00:52:27,288 --> 00:52:29,290
Please, you gotta marry me today.

1081
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:30,207
Right now.
- Today?

1082
00:52:30,207 --> 00:52:32,042
My, my gosh, Chel.

1083
00:52:32,042 --> 00:52:33,293
That's impossible.

1084
00:52:33,293 --> 00:52:34,252
We haven't made arrangements
- No.

1085
00:52:34,252 --> 00:52:35,378
- at the temple.
- Now, we can go

1086
00:52:35,378 --> 00:52:37,046
to Nevada tonight.
(cow mooing)

1087
00:52:37,046 --> 00:52:37,880
Panaca.

1088
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,298
We can get a seat on the
temple when we get back.

1089
00:52:39,298 --> 00:52:41,049
- Chel, I don't even know if Panaca's got

1090
00:52:41,049 --> 00:52:42,258
a justice of the peace.

1091
00:52:42,258 --> 00:52:43,092
My gosh, Chel.

1092
00:52:43,092 --> 00:52:43,968
Everybody'll think we had to.

1093
00:52:43,968 --> 00:52:45,469
- I don't care what people think.

1094
00:52:45,469 --> 00:52:47,137
- I haven't got the house ready.

1095
00:52:47,137 --> 00:52:48,638
No curtains, no furniture.

1096
00:52:48,638 --> 00:52:49,639
- Please Jens.

1097
00:52:49,639 --> 00:52:50,557
I'm scared.

1098
00:52:52,934 --> 00:52:54,518
- Hey.

1099
00:52:54,518 --> 00:52:56,102
Scared of what?

1100
00:52:56,102 --> 00:52:58,604
- Scared of losing everything.

1101
00:53:00,231 --> 00:53:01,482
So hold me.

1102
00:53:01,482 --> 00:53:03,567
Hold me tight as you can.

1103
00:53:04,776 --> 00:53:05,610
- Well heck then.

1104
00:53:07,821 --> 00:53:09,030
What are we waiting for?

1105
00:53:11,907 --> 00:53:13,867
You're in charge here, Heber.

1106
00:53:13,867 --> 00:53:16,744
I'll get Oley's kid Andy over
here this afternoon to help.

1107
00:53:18,245 --> 00:53:19,330
We're getting married.

1108
00:53:20,289 --> 00:53:22,708
I don't even have my dang
wedding pants hemmed up.

1109
00:53:22,708 --> 00:53:24,459
- 400.
(bell dinging)

1110
00:53:24,459 --> 00:53:25,793
And 500.

1111
00:53:25,793 --> 00:53:28,045
Now those are all brand new bills.

1112
00:53:28,045 --> 00:53:28,879
- Don't worry, Verla May.

1113
00:53:28,879 --> 00:53:29,713
I'll take very good care of them.

1114
00:53:29,713 --> 00:53:30,922
- Hide 'em in your shoe.

1115
00:53:30,922 --> 00:53:32,090
That's the best place.

1116
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:33,549
- Also, I'd like to close out the account

1117
00:53:33,549 --> 00:53:34,592
my father left me.
(door slamming)

1118
00:53:34,592 --> 00:53:36,677
There should be about $2,000.00 in there.

1119
00:53:36,677 --> 00:53:39,221
- What are you trying
to do, break the bank?

1120
00:53:40,555 --> 00:53:42,515
Well, you gotta fill out a form.

1121
00:53:43,474 --> 00:53:46,017
Can't take any money
without filling out a form.

1122
00:53:48,812 --> 00:53:50,730
I hope you're not doing something dumb

1123
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:53,065
like your brother Jens.

1124
00:53:53,065 --> 00:53:53,899
- Oh yeah?

1125
00:53:53,899 --> 00:53:55,817
What did Jens do?
- Oh, he came in this morning

1126
00:53:55,817 --> 00:53:57,485
to pick up some cash,

1127
00:53:57,485 --> 00:54:00,904
and then headed out for
Nevada with Chel Bowen.

1128
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,031
- [Chuckling) What'd you say?

1129
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:05,575
- You heard me.

1130
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,493
They're getting married
before the wedding.

1131
00:54:08,619 --> 00:54:12,205
(ominous orchestral music)

1132
00:54:13,706 --> 00:54:16,251
Erik, you forgot your money.
(door slamming)

1133
00:54:16,251 --> 00:54:17,877
- Who made her do it?
- What's the matter with you?

1134
00:54:17,877 --> 00:54:18,710
Are you sick, boy?

1135
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:19,753
- Somebody made her do it.

1136
00:54:19,753 --> 00:54:20,754
Somebody forced her.

1137
00:54:20,754 --> 00:54:22,589
It was you or Ivor.
- It was Chel.

1138
00:54:22,589 --> 00:54:23,714
Chel was the one.

1139
00:54:23,714 --> 00:54:24,757
- No.
- Yes.

1140
00:54:24,757 --> 00:54:26,049
You think I wanted this?

1141
00:54:26,049 --> 00:54:27,009
The whole family is upset.

1142
00:54:27,009 --> 00:54:29,261
They're gonna think it's a shotgun affair.

1143
00:54:29,261 --> 00:54:30,095
- She doesn't love him, I know that.

1144
00:54:30,095 --> 00:54:33,472
- You listen to me, you
listen to me Erik Eriksen.

1145
00:54:33,472 --> 00:54:35,349
I don't wanna know what this is all about.

1146
00:54:35,349 --> 00:54:37,058
But I think it's best you leave her be.

1147
00:54:37,058 --> 00:54:37,976
You understand me?

1148
00:54:37,976 --> 00:54:39,644
Leave my daughter alone.

1149
00:54:39,644 --> 00:54:41,812
- She doesn't love him.

1150
00:54:41,812 --> 00:54:43,230
- Yeah, well we'll see about that.

1151
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:44,731
(dramatic orchestral music)

1152
00:54:44,731 --> 00:54:46,441
- Got nothing fancy here to say.

1153
00:54:46,441 --> 00:54:47,776
I don't marry folks much.

1154
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,528
I'm just gotta read the ceremony,

1155
00:54:50,528 --> 00:54:51,362
if that's alright with you.

1156
00:54:51,362 --> 00:54:53,530
- That'll be fine, just read it.

1157
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:55,865
- Yes well, here it goes.

1158
00:54:55,865 --> 00:55:00,119
Do you, Chelnicia Bowen, take this man,

1159
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:02,287
Jens Perry Eriksen,

1160
00:55:02,287 --> 00:55:04,664
to be your lawful wedded husband?

1161
00:55:06,957 --> 00:55:07,792
- I do.

1162
00:55:10,127 --> 00:55:13,087
- I want you to know that I
butchered this pig myself.

1163
00:55:13,087 --> 00:55:14,755
Did my own curing.

1164
00:55:14,755 --> 00:55:16,840
I can't stand boughten ham and bacon.

1165
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,177
Oh, Jens, you can take
a plate home to Chel.

1166
00:55:20,177 --> 00:55:22,845
- Ah, I don't think
she can eat it, Mother.

1167
00:55:22,845 --> 00:55:24,930
She was feeling so poorly when I left her.

1168
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:26,932
- Well, anything we should know about?

1169
00:55:26,932 --> 00:55:29,309
- She's not expecting,
if that's what you mean.

1170
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:32,269
She's been having some bad headaches.

1171
00:55:33,228 --> 00:55:34,771
- You're right about the ham.

1172
00:55:34,771 --> 00:55:36,022
Best I ever tasted.

1173
00:55:36,022 --> 00:55:36,856
- Thank you, Erik.

1174
00:55:36,856 --> 00:55:39,192
- Glad to see you're eating again.

1175
00:55:39,192 --> 00:55:40,568
- So what's the story, Erik?

1176
00:55:41,527 --> 00:55:43,486
You're going back, ain't ya?

1177
00:55:43,486 --> 00:55:44,654
New York?

1178
00:55:44,654 --> 00:55:46,489
- Yes, I will be going back.

1179
00:55:47,448 --> 00:55:48,740
- Well, when would that be?

1180
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:50,326
- Erik hasn't been feeling good.

1181
00:55:51,785 --> 00:55:53,411
I tell him to stay right here in Templeton

1182
00:55:53,411 --> 00:55:55,205
where I can look after him.

1183
00:55:58,082 --> 00:55:59,833
- Looks like snow for the deer hunt.

1184
00:55:59,833 --> 00:56:00,917
- Looks clear to me.

1185
00:56:00,917 --> 00:56:02,544
- Snow's better.

1186
00:56:02,544 --> 00:56:03,711
Easier to see the deer.

1187
00:56:05,546 --> 00:56:06,839
Of course you wouldn't
happen to know that,

1188
00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:09,174
'cause you haven't been hunting with us.

1189
00:56:09,174 --> 00:56:11,008
Couldn't get them famous hands frostbit.

1190
00:56:11,008 --> 00:56:12,468
- Alright now, everybody eat up.

1191
00:56:12,468 --> 00:56:13,803
There's lots more in the kitchen.

1192
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:15,679
- My hands have been frostbit, Ivor.

1193
00:56:16,555 --> 00:56:18,056
In France, during the war.

1194
00:56:18,932 --> 00:56:19,807
Maybe you forgot.

1195
00:56:24,644 --> 00:56:27,814
You know actually, I think
I might enjoy the deer hunt.

1196
00:56:27,814 --> 00:56:30,483
- [Christine] You don't even eat venison.

1197
00:56:30,483 --> 00:56:32,484
- Well, sorry to leave, folks.

1198
00:56:32,484 --> 00:56:34,236
But I promised Chel I'd be home by 7:00.

1199
00:56:34,236 --> 00:56:36,237
- Well you can't leave before dessert.

1200
00:56:36,237 --> 00:56:37,864
Erik's gonna play for us later.

1201
00:56:37,864 --> 00:56:40,282
- Jens doesn't need to hear me play.

1202
00:56:40,282 --> 00:56:41,367
He can listen to Chel.

1203
00:56:42,993 --> 00:56:44,494
- Yeah.

1204
00:56:44,494 --> 00:56:46,203
Well, I better get on home.

1205
00:56:47,246 --> 00:56:48,080
- Oh.

1206
00:56:53,752 --> 00:56:55,961
I think it's a sin, Erik.

1207
00:56:55,961 --> 00:56:58,380
You give those expensive lessons to Chel

1208
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:59,339
for a wedding present,

1209
00:56:59,339 --> 00:57:02,675
and she's just plum give up on the piano.

1210
00:57:02,675 --> 00:57:05,552
I mean, they ask her to play
down at the Relief Society,

1211
00:57:05,552 --> 00:57:07,387
and she said she'd quit.

1212
00:57:07,387 --> 00:57:08,679
The girl is not herself.

1213
00:57:08,679 --> 00:57:10,806
She's just acting so queer-like.

1214
00:57:15,477 --> 00:57:18,772
(engine puttering)

1215
00:57:18,772 --> 00:57:19,855
(cow mooing)

1216
00:57:19,855 --> 00:57:22,941
(atmospheric orchestral music)

1217
00:57:22,941 --> 00:57:24,984
(dog barking)

1218
00:57:24,984 --> 00:57:26,653
- Come here, good boy.

1219
00:57:26,653 --> 00:57:28,529
That's a good boy.

1220
00:57:28,529 --> 00:57:30,031
Come to Daddy.

1221
00:57:30,031 --> 00:57:32,323
(dog barking)

1222
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:34,992
(door clacking)

1223
00:57:38,328 --> 00:57:40,580
Yeah, that's a good boy.

1224
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:41,790
Let's go see Mommy, hm?

1225
00:57:48,461 --> 00:57:49,671
Sister Chelnicia.

1226
00:57:51,213 --> 00:57:52,549
You were sorely missed.

1227
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:58,219
- His feet, did you wipe his feet?

1228
00:57:58,219 --> 00:57:59,804
It's muddy in the yard.

1229
00:57:59,804 --> 00:58:01,431
Let's get this house in order.

1230
00:58:01,431 --> 00:58:03,057
- Yeah, I wiped his paws.

1231
00:58:03,057 --> 00:58:04,808
Hey, don't get mean.

1232
00:58:05,767 --> 00:58:07,143
He's a good boy.

1233
00:58:07,143 --> 00:58:11,188
Hey, sit boy, sit.
(snapping)

1234
00:58:11,188 --> 00:58:12,648
- [Chel] How was supper?

1235
00:58:12,648 --> 00:58:14,191
- Good.

1236
00:58:14,191 --> 00:58:16,651
Five kinds of salad, three kinds of meat.

1237
00:58:16,651 --> 00:58:17,652
Biscuits, of course.

1238
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:20,654
Erik's still in town.

1239
00:58:21,822 --> 00:58:24,365
He looks sort of thin, pale.

1240
00:58:28,743 --> 00:58:30,495
- What are you staring at?

1241
00:58:30,495 --> 00:58:33,790
- You're beautiful, that's all.

1242
00:58:35,916 --> 00:58:37,501
You're just beautiful.

1243
00:58:37,501 --> 00:58:41,003
(light orchestral music)

1244
00:58:41,003 --> 00:58:44,215
- Oh Jens, he's got my slipper, Jens.

1245
00:58:44,215 --> 00:58:46,300
He chews up everything.
(dog whining)

1246
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:47,801
- Yeah, no, he's a nuisance.

1247
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,011
I just thought you wanted a dog.

1248
00:58:50,011 --> 00:58:52,680
I mean, after Ivor shot
that stray that time.

1249
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:53,597
- Well, I don't.

1250
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:56,475
I'm sorry, you smell like milk.

1251
00:59:00,644 --> 00:59:02,688
- Hey, come here, boy.

1252
00:59:02,688 --> 00:59:04,564
Come here, yeah.

1253
00:59:04,564 --> 00:59:06,107
That's a good boy.

1254
00:59:06,107 --> 00:59:08,192
(bell dinging)
(car honking)

1255
00:59:08,192 --> 00:59:11,487
(bright orchestral music)

1256
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:14,489
(engine sputtering)

1257
00:59:16,282 --> 00:59:18,993
(horse clopping)

1258
00:59:18,993 --> 00:59:21,077
(people chattering)

1259
00:59:21,077 --> 00:59:22,203
(bell ringing)
(bike clattering)

1260
00:59:22,203 --> 00:59:25,873
(dramatic orchestral music)

1261
00:59:29,709 --> 00:59:31,419
- Are you gonna avoid
me forever, is that it?

1262
00:59:31,419 --> 00:59:32,754
- I've been busy.

1263
00:59:32,754 --> 00:59:33,838
I had to get the house all ready,

1264
00:59:33,838 --> 00:59:35,547
get everything moved in.

1265
00:59:35,547 --> 00:59:37,215
- Why did you do it?

1266
00:59:38,591 --> 00:59:41,135
- What happened between us was a mistake.

1267
00:59:41,135 --> 00:59:42,136
It was wrong.

1268
00:59:42,136 --> 00:59:44,346
- Answer me, why did you marry him?

1269
00:59:44,346 --> 00:59:45,347
- We sinned.

1270
00:59:46,348 --> 00:59:47,431
It was a sin.

1271
00:59:48,516 --> 00:59:49,975
You shouldn't stay here.

1272
00:59:49,975 --> 00:59:51,143
You don't belong.

1273
00:59:51,143 --> 00:59:53,728
(horse neighing)

1274
00:59:53,728 --> 00:59:54,812
- If somebody didn't know better,

1275
00:59:54,812 --> 00:59:56,814
they'd think you two was
fighting or something.

1276
00:59:56,814 --> 00:59:58,900
- I was just telling him
I don't need his help.

1277
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:01,234
I keep telling you man,
I don't need your help.

1278
01:00:01,234 --> 01:00:02,360
- Well, as you can see,

1279
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,279
we're not gonna starve up on the hunt.

1280
01:00:05,196 --> 01:00:06,071
- Fine.

1281
01:00:06,071 --> 01:00:08,573
Ah, Jens, I'll see you in the morning.

1282
01:00:08,573 --> 01:00:10,825
- Right, I'll be riding
up with you and Ivor.

1283
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:17,122
(dramatic piano music)

1284
01:00:37,221 --> 01:00:38,514
I was out in the barn.

1285
01:00:38,514 --> 01:00:39,432
Heard the music.

1286
01:00:40,433 --> 01:00:41,475
I watched you through the window.

1287
01:00:41,475 --> 01:00:44,936
Ya, ya look like a picture.

1288
01:00:44,936 --> 01:00:46,271
Lamp shining on your hair.

1289
01:00:47,313 --> 01:00:48,689
- Peeping Tom.

1290
01:00:48,689 --> 01:00:49,690
- Hey I'm allowed.

1291
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:50,524
I'm your husband.

1292
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,819
First time I heard you
play since we got married.

1293
01:00:53,819 --> 01:00:55,403
It sounded good.

1294
01:00:55,403 --> 01:00:57,029
- I was just packing up your stuff.

1295
01:00:57,029 --> 01:00:59,156
- Oh yeah, don't want to
forget my red hunting coat.

1296
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:00,574
It's in the basement.

1297
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:01,533
Don't want somebody thinking I'm a deer.

1298
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:03,910
- When have I ever
forgotten anything, Jens?

1299
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:07,538
Aren't your meals always
ready, your house cleaned,

1300
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:08,831
clothes washed and ironed?

1301
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:11,333
- Yeah, I didn't mean that, I...

1302
01:01:15,044 --> 01:01:16,044
Sorry I interrupted.

1303
01:01:18,546 --> 01:01:21,549
(light piano music)

1304
01:01:22,382 --> 01:01:25,385
(crickets chirping)

1305
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:32,224
(engine puttering)
(rooster crowing)

1306
01:01:34,934 --> 01:01:37,520
(horn honking)

1307
01:01:38,896 --> 01:01:40,731
Good lord, Chel.

1308
01:01:40,731 --> 01:01:42,858
I thought you did all this last night.

1309
01:01:42,858 --> 01:01:44,275
- Butter won't spread.

1310
01:01:44,275 --> 01:01:46,110
- Well, you gotta soften
it with warm milk.

1311
01:01:46,110 --> 01:01:46,944
That's the way mother does it.

1312
01:01:46,944 --> 01:01:48,904
- I don't care how your mother does it.

1313
01:01:49,946 --> 01:01:51,323
- Chel.

1314
01:01:51,323 --> 01:01:53,282
What is it?
(car horn honking)

1315
01:01:53,282 --> 01:01:54,783
- That honking, can't they wait?

1316
01:01:54,783 --> 01:01:59,162
It won't hurt 'em to wait.
(rooster crowing)

1317
01:01:59,162 --> 01:02:00,622
- Yeah, where am I here?

1318
01:02:00,622 --> 01:02:03,624
Gun, ammunition, rope, bags,

1319
01:02:03,624 --> 01:02:05,292
bedding, pillow.

1320
01:02:05,292 --> 01:02:07,085
- I made some hot barley,
it's on the stove.

1321
01:02:07,085 --> 01:02:09,004
I was gonna make bacon and eggs, but--

1322
01:02:09,004 --> 01:02:11,171
- Hey did you get my hunting
coat up out of moth balls?

1323
01:02:11,171 --> 01:02:12,172
- Yes, yeah.

1324
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:16,301
- Hey, maybe I oughta ask those jokers

1325
01:02:16,301 --> 01:02:17,218
to come on in for a minute.

1326
01:02:17,218 --> 01:02:18,636
- No.

1327
01:02:18,636 --> 01:02:19,637
Jens.

1328
01:02:19,637 --> 01:02:22,055
I don't want anyone to
see my kitchen like this.

1329
01:02:23,598 --> 01:02:25,267
- Who are you trying to impress?

1330
01:02:25,267 --> 01:02:26,934
Ivor or Erik?

1331
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,857
What, I'm drinking my
barley black this morning?

1332
01:02:34,732 --> 01:02:37,359
- Since when are we out
of cream, out of dairy?

1333
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:39,361
- I could've got that myself, Chel.

1334
01:02:39,361 --> 01:02:40,237
I just--

1335
01:02:40,237 --> 01:02:43,197
- You're just used to having
your mother's way, haven't you?

1336
01:02:43,197 --> 01:02:45,241
Lord knows these sandwiches
aren't gonna be so beautiful.

1337
01:02:45,241 --> 01:02:46,909
- You cut the crusts off mine?

1338
01:02:46,909 --> 01:02:48,368
- Yes, I cut your crusts off.

1339
01:02:49,452 --> 01:02:50,287
- I'm sorry, Chel.

1340
01:02:50,287 --> 01:02:52,329
I just don't like the crust.

1341
01:02:52,329 --> 01:02:54,123
(car horn honking)

1342
01:02:54,123 --> 01:02:55,707
- God, can't you tell them to stop?

1343
01:02:55,707 --> 01:02:57,000
I can't concentrate.

1344
01:02:57,918 --> 01:02:58,752
- Chel.

1345
01:02:59,794 --> 01:03:01,504
Maybe I better not go.

1346
01:03:03,172 --> 01:03:04,298
- No.

1347
01:03:04,298 --> 01:03:05,299
Sorry, Jens.

1348
01:03:07,634 --> 01:03:08,885
You're so good.

1349
01:03:09,843 --> 01:03:12,095
I'm just not myself lately.

1350
01:03:16,391 --> 01:03:18,810
(rooster crowing)

1351
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:19,851
(car horn honking)

1352
01:03:19,851 --> 01:03:20,811
- [Jens] I'm coming.

1353
01:03:20,811 --> 01:03:22,896
Will ya hold your horses?

1354
01:03:24,647 --> 01:03:25,940
- [Ivor] I've been
sitting out here forever.

1355
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:26,899
I'm thinking about going
- Hey, Jens.

1356
01:03:26,899 --> 01:03:28,025
- home and shaving again.
- I got it.

1357
01:03:28,025 --> 01:03:29,234
- [Jens] It's my turn to drive.

1358
01:03:29,234 --> 01:03:34,238
- You get breakfast?
(engine puttering)

1359
01:03:35,698 --> 01:03:39,367
(dramatic orchestral music)

1360
01:03:46,290 --> 01:03:47,123
- Jens.

1361
01:03:52,377 --> 01:03:53,712
Jens, your coat.

1362
01:04:14,895 --> 01:04:17,189
- This thing is more
trouble than it's worth.

1363
01:04:17,189 --> 01:04:19,524
Give me a pair of horses anytime.

1364
01:04:19,524 --> 01:04:21,150
- She didn't pack my red hunting coat.

1365
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:22,485
Gosh, I swear to God.

1366
01:04:22,485 --> 01:04:24,612
I only brought my milking jacket.

1367
01:04:24,612 --> 01:04:26,238
It's not warm enough for anything.

1368
01:04:26,238 --> 01:04:27,781
My red cap, too.

1369
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:29,074
It's in the pocket.

1370
01:04:29,074 --> 01:04:31,451
- (chuckling) And you thought
you had the perfect wife.

1371
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:34,286
- I've never known Chel
to forget anything.

1372
01:04:34,286 --> 01:04:35,912
It's your fault, Erik.

1373
01:04:35,912 --> 01:04:37,956
She's up half the night playing the piano.

1374
01:04:37,956 --> 01:04:38,874
Didn't even get around to making

1375
01:04:38,874 --> 01:04:40,541
the sandwiches 'til this morning.

1376
01:04:41,417 --> 01:04:43,043
- Here.

1377
01:04:43,043 --> 01:04:45,879
Take my coat, I won't
be doing much hunting.

1378
01:04:45,879 --> 01:04:47,964
- Who says you ain't huntin'?

1379
01:04:47,964 --> 01:04:49,465
You're getting your buck, boy.

1380
01:04:50,966 --> 01:04:52,092
We'll get you some warm duds.

1381
01:04:52,092 --> 01:04:54,261
Here.you put that around your hat.

1382
01:04:55,553 --> 01:04:56,513
Bright enough.

1383
01:04:56,513 --> 01:04:58,514
Never seen a deer wearing
a red handkerchief.

1384
01:04:58,514 --> 01:05:00,432
(geese squawking)

1385
01:05:00,432 --> 01:05:02,308
Hey let's go, let's get the lead out.

1386
01:05:03,268 --> 01:05:04,227
We'll be back soon.

1387
01:05:05,811 --> 01:05:08,563
(men chattering)

1388
01:05:10,732 --> 01:05:12,233
(light guitar music)
- Come on, you want some?

1389
01:05:12,233 --> 01:05:14,360
- No, no thanks.

1390
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:15,819
- Come on boys, best
home brew in the county.

1391
01:05:15,819 --> 01:05:16,737
- Against my religion.
- Yes.

1392
01:05:16,737 --> 01:05:17,571
- Come on, Jens.

1393
01:05:19,281 --> 01:05:21,491
- Yeah, a little vacation won't hurt you.

1394
01:05:21,491 --> 01:05:23,910
I guess every man needs
that once in a while.

(men laughing)

1403
01:05:49,346 --> 01:05:50,306
- Taking a whiz?

1404
01:05:51,723 --> 01:05:53,850
- No, just, a smoke.

1405
01:05:55,810 --> 01:05:56,686
You want one?

1406
01:05:56,686 --> 01:05:58,187
- (chuckling) No thanks, Erik.

1407
01:05:58,187 --> 01:06:00,189
I learned my lesson when I was 10,

1408
01:06:00,189 --> 01:06:01,773
smoking cedar bark in daddy's barn.

1409
01:06:01,773 --> 01:06:02,941
(Erik chuckling)
(Jens laughing)

1410
01:06:02,941 --> 01:06:04,567
Nearly burned it down.

1411
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:09,696
My gosh, would you look at those stars.

1412
01:06:11,406 --> 01:06:14,533
It looks like you could
pick 'em like peaches.

1413
01:06:14,533 --> 01:06:15,367
- Yes.

1414
01:06:17,368 --> 01:06:19,204
- Moonlight through the pines.

1415
01:06:19,204 --> 01:06:21,539
(men chattering)

1416
01:06:21,539 --> 01:06:23,332
All I need is Chel up here with me.

1417
01:06:26,167 --> 01:06:27,794
You got a girl, Erik?

1418
01:06:27,794 --> 01:06:28,627
- What?

1419
01:06:28,627 --> 01:06:30,463
- You know, a girlfriend.

1420
01:06:30,463 --> 01:06:32,255
Waiting for you back East.

1421
01:06:32,255 --> 01:06:34,549
Your fancy free now since the divorce.

1422
01:06:35,425 --> 01:06:36,509
- Not really.

1423
01:06:36,509 --> 01:06:37,635
No one.

1424
01:06:37,635 --> 01:06:39,261
- Come on, Erik.

1425
01:06:39,261 --> 01:06:40,304
You can tell me.

1426
01:06:41,388 --> 01:06:43,473
I bet you got hot and cold running women

1427
01:06:43,473 --> 01:06:44,932
back there in New York.

1428
01:06:44,932 --> 01:06:48,853
Handsome guy like yourself.
(Erik chuckling)

1429
01:06:48,853 --> 01:06:49,686
So.

1430
01:06:51,688 --> 01:06:52,522
What am I?

1431
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:55,108
The village idiot?

1432
01:06:56,066 --> 01:06:57,359
- What are you talking about?

1433
01:06:57,359 --> 01:06:59,236
- Or am I just a stupid country hick?

1434
01:07:00,112 --> 01:07:01,988
(dramatic orchestral music)
- I never thought that you

1435
01:07:01,988 --> 01:07:03,030
were a country hick.

1436
01:07:03,030 --> 01:07:04,948
I know you're not stupid.

1437
01:07:04,948 --> 01:07:07,283
- Then don't you think I know?

1438
01:07:07,283 --> 01:07:08,076
If I'm not stupid,

1439
01:07:08,076 --> 01:07:10,370
don't you think I figured it out?

1440
01:07:10,370 --> 01:07:13,538
There's something going
on between you and Chel.

1441
01:07:13,538 --> 01:07:14,456
I don't know what it is,

1442
01:07:14,456 --> 01:07:17,250
but hell, I don't like it.

1443
01:07:18,793 --> 01:07:21,545
- Hey, pouring up another one in here.

1444
01:07:21,545 --> 01:07:24,256
- Yeah, be right in in a minute.

1445
01:07:28,092 --> 01:07:29,968
Man, I could go for some
more of that home brew.

1446
01:07:29,968 --> 01:07:30,969
How about you?

1447
01:07:30,969 --> 01:07:33,263
- Jens, Chel is your wife.

1448
01:07:34,555 --> 01:07:36,557
- I know, I know.

1449
01:07:36,557 --> 01:07:37,349
Forget it.

1450
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:40,394
I have to trust you.

1451
01:07:40,394 --> 01:07:42,478
You're my brother.

1452
01:07:42,478 --> 01:07:44,230
And blood is thicker than water.

1453
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:45,148
Isn't that right?

1454
01:07:45,148 --> 01:07:47,525
- Isn't that right?
(Jens chuckling)

1455
01:07:47,525 --> 01:07:48,358
- Whoa.

1456
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,989
(men laughing)

1457
01:07:55,989 --> 01:08:00,993
(water rushing)
(birds chirping)

1458
01:08:05,955 --> 01:08:07,832
- That the only handkerchief you got?

1459
01:08:08,958 --> 01:08:10,043
I knew a fella one time here,

1460
01:08:10,043 --> 01:08:11,669
had a white handkerchief.

1461
01:08:11,669 --> 01:08:12,753
Another fella thought he was a deer,

1462
01:08:12,753 --> 01:08:14,171
and blew his face all to hell.

1463
01:08:14,171 --> 01:08:16,756
- Yeah well we don't
shoot at a deer's backend.

1464
01:08:16,756 --> 01:08:19,258
- Yeah, well we're not
the only hunters up here.

1465
01:08:19,258 --> 01:08:21,468
Some of these boys get
pretty trigger happy.

1466
01:08:22,594 --> 01:08:23,887
Hey hold it up up there.

1467
01:08:25,971 --> 01:08:27,807
Let's figure this thing out here.

1468
01:08:27,807 --> 01:08:29,849
- Hey, watch for my red flag.

1469
01:08:29,849 --> 01:08:31,184
I'll take the first stand in the hollow.

1470
01:08:31,184 --> 01:08:32,644
- Alright.

1471
01:08:32,644 --> 01:08:34,145
- Alright Erik, you go on down there.

1472
01:08:34,145 --> 01:08:36,063
I'll get Oley here to send
you down a little doe.

1473
01:08:36,063 --> 01:08:38,023
- God, Ivor, I'm not gonna shoot a doe.

1474
01:08:38,982 --> 01:08:40,817
- Well, then I'll just tell him

1475
01:08:40,817 --> 01:08:42,401
to send down a big old buck.

1476
01:08:43,485 --> 01:08:45,779
I'll tell him little
Erik's got a beat on him.

1477
01:08:54,578 --> 01:08:56,996
(ominous music)

1478
01:08:56,996 --> 01:08:59,832
(birds squawking)

1479
01:09:07,589 --> 01:09:10,341
(birds chirping)

1480
01:09:22,058 --> 01:09:23,476
(branch cracking)

1481
01:09:23,476 --> 01:09:26,395
(hooves pattering)

1482
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:51,248
(gun firing)

1483
01:09:55,627 --> 01:09:59,546
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1484
01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:14,725
(branch cracking)

1485
01:10:23,065 --> 01:10:25,651
(Erik panting)

1486
01:10:56,216 --> 01:10:57,342
- I got you now.

1487
01:11:03,431 --> 01:11:05,849
(gun firing)

1488
01:11:07,893 --> 01:11:10,645
(birds chirping)

1489
01:11:27,491 --> 01:11:29,785
(dramatic orchestral music)

1490
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:34,789
Oh, God.

1491
01:11:40,711 --> 01:11:41,545
Jens.

1492
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:43,254
No.

1493
01:11:46,841 --> 01:11:49,093
No, not you, Jens, not you.

1494
01:11:50,552 --> 01:11:52,220
Say something for me.

1495
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:57,224
Oh, something, something.

1496
01:12:02,436 --> 01:12:03,270
Help!

1497
01:12:06,857 --> 01:12:07,691
Help!

1498
01:12:08,733 --> 01:12:09,567
Help.

1499
01:12:15,822 --> 01:12:16,698
- Erik.

1500
01:12:27,624 --> 01:12:29,125
Oh, brother.

1501
01:12:29,125 --> 01:12:30,209
Baby brother.

1502
01:12:53,394 --> 01:12:55,812
(gun firing)

1503
01:13:03,068 --> 01:13:05,362
It was an accident, wasn't it?

1504
01:13:05,362 --> 01:13:06,321
- An accident, Ivor.

1505
01:13:06,321 --> 01:13:07,405
My God, what else would it be?

1506
01:13:07,405 --> 01:13:09,032
- You knew where he was.

1507
01:13:09,032 --> 01:13:09,948
Here in the hollow.

1508
01:13:11,534 --> 01:13:12,701
You called about her.

1509
01:13:12,701 --> 01:13:14,411
- No, no, I, I wounded a buck.

1510
01:13:14,411 --> 01:13:15,745
I was following it.
- You and Chel.

1511
01:13:15,745 --> 01:13:18,205
- I didn't know where I was.
- You don't think I knew it.

1512
01:13:18,205 --> 01:13:19,748
- Uh!

1513
01:13:19,748 --> 01:13:21,667
God, help me.

1514
01:13:21,667 --> 01:13:23,334
- In this family, we take care of our own.

1515
01:13:23,334 --> 01:13:25,003
- No.

1516
01:13:25,003 --> 01:13:26,170
No, I wounded a buck,

1517
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:27,838
and I didn't know where I was.

1518
01:13:27,838 --> 01:13:28,672
I didn't know where

1519
01:13:28,672 --> 01:13:29,506
I was going.
- Look at me.

1520
01:13:29,506 --> 01:13:30,965
Now you listen to me, Erik Eriksen.

1521
01:13:30,965 --> 01:13:32,801
You dare touch her,

1522
01:13:32,801 --> 01:13:34,510
I will kill you with my own hands.

1523
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:38,680
(dramatic orchestral music)

1524
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:39,889
- Ivor.
- Ivor.

1525
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:43,810
- [Man] Hey, let him up.

1526
01:13:43,810 --> 01:13:45,644
- Oh, my God.

1527
01:13:45,644 --> 01:13:50,648
Oh, my God.

1528
01:13:51,774 --> 01:13:52,942
What happened?

1529
01:13:54,318 --> 01:13:55,694
Jens!

1530
01:13:55,694 --> 01:13:57,946
Jens, good God, you killed him.

1531
01:13:57,946 --> 01:13:59,030
Jens, oh God!

1532
01:14:18,045 --> 01:14:19,254
- Your mother used to work for us.

1533
01:14:19,254 --> 01:14:20,964
Did you know that?

1534
01:14:20,964 --> 01:14:22,632
- Yes.

1535
01:14:22,632 --> 01:14:24,300
She told me.

1536
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:26,760
- Used to do the washing,
scrub the floors.

1537
01:14:28,261 --> 01:14:30,513
Until my father decided
to take another wife.

1538
01:14:34,308 --> 01:14:35,184
Hell, I remember.

1539
01:14:36,977 --> 01:14:38,728
I was only so high, but I remember.

1540
01:14:42,022 --> 01:14:45,317
Saddest day of my life, until today,

1541
01:14:46,901 --> 01:14:48,152
was the day you was born.

1542
01:14:50,446 --> 01:14:53,698
(atmospheric orchestral music)

1543
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:55,408
Mama tried to make the best of it,

1544
01:14:56,368 --> 01:14:57,869
even helped with the birthing.

1545
01:14:59,536 --> 01:15:00,704
Later on, I heard her.

1546
01:15:02,539 --> 01:15:03,664
Crying in her bedroom.

1547
01:15:09,169 --> 01:15:11,212
Not gonna tell anybody who fired the gun.

1548
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:16,342
Could've been a stray
bullet from above the ridge.

1549
01:15:17,635 --> 01:15:18,468
Decided that.

1550
01:15:24,181 --> 01:15:25,057
After the funeral,

1551
01:15:25,974 --> 01:15:28,018
I want you out of this here town forever.

1552
01:15:30,686 --> 01:15:31,812
That's all I'm asking.

1553
01:15:33,438 --> 01:15:35,149
So as I don't have to look at you,

1554
01:15:35,149 --> 01:15:37,651
stuffy little sissy
bastard, in the eyes again.

1555
01:15:43,822 --> 01:15:45,823
- You boys got your buck already?

1556
01:16:01,336 --> 01:16:03,671
- Chel, I got some bad news.

1557
01:16:16,765 --> 01:16:20,435
(dramatic orchestral music)

1558
01:16:35,363 --> 01:16:37,740
(atmospheric music)
(birds chirping)

1559
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:39,241
Jens was the baby.

1560
01:16:41,076 --> 01:16:42,536
He was born on Christmas Eve.

1561
01:16:44,787 --> 01:16:47,081
I always thought Santa Claus brung him.

1562
01:16:47,081 --> 01:16:48,040
10 years old.

1563
01:16:49,166 --> 01:16:51,501
He used to shine shoes
down at the post office.

1564
01:16:53,127 --> 01:16:55,129
One day, he was shining
a pair of cowboy boots,

1565
01:16:55,129 --> 01:16:59,591
and a man looked down,
gave him a rosy tip.

1566
01:17:00,633 --> 01:17:02,259
Quit right then and there.

1567
01:17:02,259 --> 01:17:05,804
He told me he ain't never

1568
01:17:05,804 --> 01:17:08,598
gonna shine no pair of shoes
again, as long as he lives.

1569
01:17:09,682 --> 01:17:11,892
Oh Lord, just take care of him.

1570
01:17:12,852 --> 01:17:14,936
(crying)

1571
01:17:17,814 --> 01:17:20,316
(Chel crying)

1572
01:17:31,617 --> 01:17:34,785
(mourners chattering)

1573
01:17:37,913 --> 01:17:38,747
- Chel.

1574
01:17:49,922 --> 01:17:52,675
(horse clopping)

1575
01:17:58,013 --> 01:18:00,765
(horse clopping)

1576
01:18:09,105 --> 01:18:11,732
(knocking on door)

1577
01:18:11,732 --> 01:18:12,566
Chel?

1578
01:18:13,733 --> 01:18:15,652
Brought a little food up here for you.

1579
01:18:21,573 --> 01:18:23,491
Make you feel better.

1580
01:18:23,491 --> 01:18:25,910
Get a little food in your stomach.

1581
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:27,119
- [Chel] I'm not hungry.

1582
01:18:29,579 --> 01:18:30,955
- Whole family downstairs.

1583
01:18:32,874 --> 01:18:34,333
So many people turned out.

1584
01:18:35,376 --> 01:18:37,795
Jens had so many friends, it's a comfort.

1585
01:18:39,296 --> 01:18:40,338
- He was so cold.

1586
01:18:42,131 --> 01:18:43,800
When I touched him in his casket.

1587
01:18:48,428 --> 01:18:50,846
- That wasn't him, Chel.

1588
01:18:50,846 --> 01:18:52,932
That was just his earthly body.

1589
01:18:52,932 --> 01:18:54,808
Jens' spirit already left him.

1590
01:18:55,725 --> 01:18:57,351
It's taken flight, so to speak.

1591
01:18:59,603 --> 01:19:02,147
These things are hard for
us mortals to understand.

1592
01:19:03,273 --> 01:19:04,524
- I wasn't good to him.

1593
01:19:06,943 --> 01:19:08,319
I wasn't a good wife.

1594
01:19:08,319 --> 01:19:10,071
- Well, of course you was.

1595
01:19:10,071 --> 01:19:11,530
Oh he was proud of you.

1596
01:19:13,656 --> 01:19:14,490
My golly.

1597
01:19:15,408 --> 01:19:17,827
You kept that house neat as a pin.

1598
01:19:17,827 --> 01:19:19,869
- He tried so hard to make me happy.

1599
01:19:19,869 --> 01:19:21,705
- Well, you was happy.

1600
01:19:22,956 --> 01:19:25,333
The two of you, of course you was.

1601
01:19:25,333 --> 01:19:27,000
Hey.

1602
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,086
I remember when you was just a little tot.

1603
01:19:30,878 --> 01:19:33,589
Perched up on your daddy's
knee at the baseball games.

1604
01:19:35,841 --> 01:19:38,051
You was just a little angel.

1605
01:19:40,553 --> 01:19:43,430
(dramatic orchestral music)

1606
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:45,265
Mother and I was thinking you might

1607
01:19:45,265 --> 01:19:46,683
wanna come over here to live.

1608
01:19:49,352 --> 01:19:51,103
Oley's boy can take over the dairy.

1609
01:19:53,105 --> 01:19:53,939
- I can go home.

1610
01:19:55,398 --> 01:19:57,942
To my daddy's house, I mean.

1611
01:19:57,942 --> 01:19:59,485
- You're an Eriksen now, Chel.

1612
01:20:00,569 --> 01:20:02,946
You don't belong at your daddy's house.

1613
01:20:07,032 --> 01:20:10,619
I don't want you to be afraid of nothing.

1614
01:20:10,619 --> 01:20:11,911
Jens was my brother.

1615
01:20:13,079 --> 01:20:15,248
I'm gonna take care of you now.

1616
01:20:15,248 --> 01:20:16,374
- I don't--

1617
01:20:16,374 --> 01:20:19,417
- No, I don't mean nothing like marriage.

1618
01:20:20,502 --> 01:20:22,294
With my brother barely in the grave.

1619
01:20:24,546 --> 01:20:26,798
I mean, not unless
somewhere down the line,

1620
01:20:26,798 --> 01:20:28,341
that's what you want.

1621
01:20:28,341 --> 01:20:30,135
- I, I can't.

1622
01:20:30,135 --> 01:20:30,968
I can't.
- Listen,

1623
01:20:30,968 --> 01:20:32,720
I jumped the gun here.

1624
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:33,553
I'm sorry.

1625
01:20:34,638 --> 01:20:36,806
I'm not good at these type of things.

1626
01:20:36,806 --> 01:20:38,016
I never learned to find a ways.

1627
01:20:38,016 --> 01:20:40,726
I'm not smooth like some we know.

1628
01:20:47,690 --> 01:20:50,151
You and me belong here, Chel.

1629
01:20:50,151 --> 01:20:50,984
One of these days, we're gonna

1630
01:20:50,984 --> 01:20:53,069
be buried right out
there alongside of Jens.

1631
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:57,364
I care about my family.

1632
01:20:59,324 --> 01:21:00,950
And about doing the right thing.

1633
01:21:02,368 --> 01:21:03,327
You can count on me,

1634
01:21:03,327 --> 01:21:05,871
that's what I'm trying to say.

1635
01:21:05,871 --> 01:21:07,080
To take care of things.

1636
01:21:08,874 --> 01:21:10,458
Keep it in the family.

1637
01:21:17,172 --> 01:21:20,091
I'll wait outside the door for you.

1638
01:21:30,433 --> 01:21:34,102
(dramatic orchestral music)

1639
01:21:48,655 --> 01:21:50,490
- [Man] Accept my condolences.

1640
01:21:50,490 --> 01:21:52,534
- [Woman] Such a shame.

1641
01:21:52,534 --> 01:21:55,119
(mourners chattering)

1642
01:21:55,119 --> 01:21:56,203
- Dear, Ivor.

1643
01:21:57,287 --> 01:21:58,288
- Mercy.

1644
01:21:58,288 --> 01:21:59,122
- [Woman] Oh my dear.

1645
01:21:59,122 --> 01:22:02,166
(mourners chattering)

1646
01:22:02,166 --> 01:22:04,293
- I'm so sorry, Christine.

1647
01:22:04,293 --> 01:22:05,752
- I'm glad that you was here.

1648
01:22:06,753 --> 01:22:09,172
That you two had some time together.

1649
01:22:10,256 --> 01:22:13,425
Erik, I know my boys give you a bad time,

1650
01:22:13,425 --> 01:22:16,052
but Jens always stood up for you.

1651
01:22:16,052 --> 01:22:18,096
He always said you was a artist.

1652
01:22:20,014 --> 01:22:22,725
(crying)

1653
01:22:22,725 --> 01:22:24,184
It was them Salt Lakers.

1654
01:22:24,184 --> 01:22:26,978
They come down here to shoot
at anything that moves.

1655
01:22:26,978 --> 01:22:27,979
- I'll be leaving in the morning.

1656
01:22:27,979 --> 01:22:29,021
I have to pack.

1657
01:22:29,021 --> 01:22:31,189
- Two of my boys lie buried in France.

1658
01:22:31,189 --> 01:22:32,315
And I guess with war,
(dramatic orchestral music)

1659
01:22:32,315 --> 01:22:33,817
you come to expect it.

1660
01:22:33,817 --> 01:22:35,693
But little Jens.

1661
01:22:35,693 --> 01:22:38,863
I keep remembering how he
wouldn't eat his bread crusts.

1662
01:22:39,946 --> 01:22:41,615
Even when he was grown up.

1663
01:22:41,615 --> 01:22:43,116
- I have to pack.

1664
01:22:43,116 --> 01:22:43,950
I have to.

1665
01:22:46,619 --> 01:22:47,620
I have to pack.

1666
01:22:47,620 --> 01:22:49,121
- [Christine] Jens, Jens.

1667
01:22:49,121 --> 01:22:52,790
(dramatic orchestral music)

1668
01:23:04,133 --> 01:23:08,052
(atmospheric orchestral music)

1669
01:23:33,156 --> 01:23:36,158
(knocking on door)

1670
01:23:36,158 --> 01:23:37,535
- What is it?

1671
01:23:37,535 --> 01:23:38,786
- Chel is here.

1672
01:23:43,289 --> 01:23:44,998
She doesn't seem right, Erik.

1673
01:23:44,998 --> 01:23:48,251
She seems to be confused or something.

1674
01:23:49,127 --> 01:23:51,086
She looks so strange.

1675
01:23:52,337 --> 01:23:54,714
You shouldn't go back to
New York so soon, Erik.

1676
01:23:54,714 --> 01:23:56,550
The strain of all this.

1677
01:24:02,054 --> 01:24:02,888
- Chel.

1678
01:24:04,181 --> 01:24:05,015
- Erik.

1679
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:09,893
I love you.

1680
01:24:11,895 --> 01:24:12,854
I never stopped.

1681
01:24:14,147 --> 01:24:15,648
- Wait.

1682
01:24:15,648 --> 01:24:16,441
Chel.

1683
01:24:19,651 --> 01:24:21,445
There's something that you don't know.

1684
01:24:30,410 --> 01:24:32,078
The boys decided not to tell you.

1685
01:24:32,078 --> 01:24:33,704
They decided not to tell anybody.

1686
01:24:36,623 --> 01:24:39,542
On the hunt, I wounded a deer.

1687
01:24:41,043 --> 01:24:43,712
I was following it, the blood.

1688
01:24:44,671 --> 01:24:47,006
I saw a flash of red, and I fired.

1689
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:51,427
It was his handkerchief.

1690
01:24:52,761 --> 01:24:54,346
It was his red handkerchief.

1691
01:24:57,473 --> 01:25:00,059
I'm the one that killed him, Chel.

1692
01:25:00,059 --> 01:25:00,892
I'm the one.

1693
01:25:03,394 --> 01:25:06,063
- He didn't have his red hunting coat.

1694
01:25:06,063 --> 01:25:07,231
(bell ringing)

1695
01:25:07,231 --> 01:25:09,983
You would've seen him if I
had remembered to put it in.

1696
01:25:11,150 --> 01:25:13,652
I've gone over it and over it.

1697
01:25:15,071 --> 01:25:16,572
It was my fault.

1698
01:25:16,572 --> 01:25:18,531
- No, I knew he didn't
have his red hunting coat.

1699
01:25:18,531 --> 01:25:21,117
I knew where he was
standing, in the hollow.

1700
01:25:21,117 --> 01:25:23,953
As I pulled the trigger,
Chel, I think I knew.

1701
01:25:23,953 --> 01:25:24,745
- Stop.

1702
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:27,038
Don't say that.

1703
01:25:27,038 --> 01:25:27,873
- No it's true.

1704
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:31,459
I think somewhere deep inside,

1705
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:32,710
I wanted to kill him.

1706
01:25:34,794 --> 01:25:35,629
- Erik.

1707
01:25:36,838 --> 01:25:39,215
Don't ever say that to anybody.

1708
01:25:39,215 --> 01:25:40,049
Never.

1709
01:25:41,842 --> 01:25:43,761
(door clacking)

1710
01:25:43,761 --> 01:25:44,594
- Chel?

1711
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:48,973
Maybe a cup of Mormon tea, hmm?

1712
01:25:48,973 --> 01:25:49,806
- No.

1713
01:25:50,849 --> 01:25:51,850
Mother.

1714
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:54,352
Chel's going home to her father's.

1715
01:25:54,352 --> 01:25:55,353
I'm taking her home.

1716
01:25:56,812 --> 01:26:00,440
(dramatic orchestral music)

1717
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:02,942
(crickets chirping)

1718
01:26:02,942 --> 01:26:03,985
- It just came to me.

1719
01:26:05,361 --> 01:26:06,194
It's so clear.

1720
01:26:07,154 --> 01:26:08,696
I didn't go with you to New York

1721
01:26:08,696 --> 01:26:10,573
because it wasn't part of God's plan.

1722
01:26:11,491 --> 01:26:13,034
He needed Jens in heaven.

1723
01:26:13,034 --> 01:26:14,951
- Chel, you can justify anything

1724
01:26:14,951 --> 01:26:16,787
by saying it was God's plan.

1725
01:26:17,954 --> 01:26:20,123
It doesn't make a difference, he is dead.

1726
01:26:21,457 --> 01:26:23,042
He was moving one minute.

1727
01:26:24,043 --> 01:26:24,918
Alive.

1728
01:26:26,295 --> 01:26:27,295
He was laughing.

1729
01:26:28,254 --> 01:26:29,880
If you can find a plan for that.

1730
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:34,384
- You still love me.

1731
01:26:35,343 --> 01:26:36,428
I know you do.

1732
01:26:37,762 --> 01:26:39,055
- Listen to me.

1733
01:26:39,055 --> 01:26:41,265
I can't be with you, ever.

1734
01:26:41,265 --> 01:26:42,683
- We'll wait.

1735
01:26:42,683 --> 01:26:44,184
- Ivor knows.

1736
01:26:44,184 --> 01:26:46,686
- Ivor will never tell anyone.

1737
01:26:46,686 --> 01:26:48,771
He would never do that to the family name.

1738
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:53,482
We'll wait a long time, even here.

1739
01:26:53,482 --> 01:26:55,109
- You don't know what you're saying.

1740
01:26:55,109 --> 01:26:57,611
- I only know that I love you.

1741
01:26:58,779 --> 01:27:00,197
I have always loved you.

1742
01:27:00,197 --> 01:27:02,865
- How could we ever live with it, Chel?

1743
01:27:02,865 --> 01:27:05,284
Do you really think that Jens
is in the clouds celebrating,

1744
01:27:05,284 --> 01:27:07,077
doing a special job for God?

1745
01:27:07,077 --> 01:27:08,161
- Yes.

1746
01:27:08,161 --> 01:27:10,788
I do.
- No, he is nowhere.

1747
01:27:10,788 --> 01:27:12,206
I killed him, he's dead.

1748
01:27:12,206 --> 01:27:13,457
I even think I meant to.

1749
01:27:13,457 --> 01:27:14,874
Don't you understand that?

1750
01:27:16,167 --> 01:27:19,087
- That day, rolling in the grass,

1751
01:27:19,087 --> 01:27:22,297
with the sun and the
trees above our heads.

1752
01:27:22,297 --> 01:27:23,924
- No, you were right.

1753
01:27:23,924 --> 01:27:24,841
It was a sin.

1754
01:27:25,758 --> 01:27:27,176
I cheated on my brother.

1755
01:27:27,176 --> 01:27:29,845
- Erik, we couldn't help ourselves.

1756
01:27:29,845 --> 01:27:31,054
We were burning up.

1757
01:27:32,723 --> 01:27:34,432
- I love you, Chel.

1758
01:27:34,432 --> 01:27:36,309
(dramatic orchestral music)

1759
01:27:36,309 --> 01:27:37,893
I loved you before.

1760
01:27:39,019 --> 01:27:40,770
And I love you still.

1761
01:27:42,230 --> 01:27:43,397
I always will.

1762
01:27:46,984 --> 01:27:49,402
But I can't take you away from here.

1763
01:27:50,820 --> 01:27:53,405
I'll never see you again, Chel.

1764
01:27:58,118 --> 01:28:01,787
(dramatic orchestral music)

1765
01:28:07,458 --> 01:28:09,793
- You'll come back for me.

1766
01:28:09,793 --> 01:28:11,128
I know you will.

1767
01:28:51,869 --> 01:28:54,996
(bright piano music)

1768
01:29:04,837 --> 01:29:07,799
(gun clacking)

1769
01:29:07,799 --> 01:29:08,632
- Erik.

1770
01:29:10,384 --> 01:29:13,219
Don't wanna shoot you in the back.

1771
01:29:15,888 --> 01:29:16,722
- No.

1772
01:29:18,598 --> 01:29:20,017
Ivor.

1773
01:29:20,017 --> 01:29:23,269
(dramatic piano music)

1774
01:29:25,729 --> 01:29:26,814
- I told you.

1775
01:29:28,023 --> 01:29:31,359
In this family, we take care of our own.

1776
01:29:43,368 --> 01:29:45,787
(gun firing)

1777
01:30:42,916 --> 01:30:46,586
(dramatic orchestral music)

1778
01:31:30,871 --> 01:31:33,248
(bright guitar music)

1779
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:36,918
(dramatic orchestral music)
