1
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:09,048
It was spoken, by our Elders,
that a darkness would come,

2
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:12,782
a shadow that would turn
brother on brother,

3
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:16,022
a plague of fire and steel.

4
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:20,089
A plague of fear
in the form of a dragon.

5
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:24,699
Those who still live remember
when the Vitalion came,

6
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:30,034
their endless legions broke through
the people like a mighty steel wave.

7
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,501
And with their metal they brought fire.

8
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:38,172
They brought the very beast of prophecy.

9
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:40,844
A dragon.

10
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:47,688
Man and beast and the earth herself
collapsed beneath its curse.

11
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,494
The Deiran, were broken,

12
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:55,492
our heroes and dreams were
swallowed in unquenchable flame.

13
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,569
The dragon destroyed everything.

14
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:02,535
Even as our people clung
to the edge of an Abyss,

15
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,705
they had one hope.

16
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:08,178
That a hero would rise
to fulfill the prophecy,

17
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:12,746
a warrior of light to do battle
with the very Inferno itself,

18
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,681
to crown a dragon,

19
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:18,481
kill a dragon.

20
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,235
Must reach Garrick
with the Falarica by Lammas Eve.

21
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,434
I'll leave at dawn.

22
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,909
I was pursued... A Vitalion patrol.

23
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:44,606
Vitalions?
They should have moved on by now.

24
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,206
Only a few patrols are left.

25
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,349
They're delayed
with attacks in the south.

26
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,214
It's alright.

27
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,320
- The dragon sleeps.
- Corvus has spies everywhere.

28
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:56,187
- It's only a matter of time...
- Time, time...

29
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,861
My niece must come with me.

30
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,026
I would that it were not so.

31
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,100
The Leode will be safe,
should anything happen...

32
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:04,358
Perhaps.

33
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:06,767
The Leodrine still awaits the prophecy.

34
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,563
It's getting light outside,

35
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,640
I'll double back toward the ford
and head north.

36
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,903
And then?

37
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,907
I'll keep them interested as I can.

38
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,914
Elenn. Elenn. Rise, my child.

39
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,390
- Aunt?
- Dress yourself.

40
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,456
Plain. We need to leave.

41
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,893
Leave? Where?

42
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:37,062
I know you were eavesdropping
so you can drop the mummer's act.

43
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,303
But we have no servants...
No escort

44
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:54,649
It's the plainest one I've got.

45
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:57,253
It's a wonder one of the servants
didn't steal it when they ran off.

46
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,814
Where are we going?

47
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,782
Open it.

48
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:11,964
Some say it was a great weapon,
broken in an ancient battle.

49
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:21,006
Is this the Falarica?

50
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,814
It is now the path
to Deiran independence.

51
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,176
For your impertinence.

52
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,746
Magister Corvus,
we found one of Garrick's men.

53
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,042
Very good.

54
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:08,386
I apologize.

55
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:13,923
The Guard can be a little
overzealous with traitors.

56
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,925
There's only one traitor here.

57
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,708
The Emperor is master in Deira now.

58
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:28,007
We Deiran are his subjects,
so you are traitor to him.

59
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,675
You plot to make Garrick King.

60
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:35,249
Garrick is no king but a low-born
pretender to a broken throne.

61
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,051
Beautiful aren't they?

62
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:44,285
They are despised by us Deirans,

63
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:46,890
and yet they possess
the greatest of all qualities.

64
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:48,964
They are survivors.

65
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,303
But I digress.

66
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:55,730
The Vitalions, in their wisdom,

67
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:57,540
pride themselves on employing

68
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,301
some of the finest interrogators
in the known world.

69
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:05,173
Priests from the disease
and rat ridden islands of Ravalan, mainly.

70
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,650
They worship some particularly
bloodthirsty gods out there,

71
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,283
and they have found the time,

72
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:14,047
and inclination,
to raise tonure to a veritable an form.

73
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:18,958
I once saw them remove
a living man's skin in a single piece.

74
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:24,334
Not to worry,
I prefer more civilized methods.

75
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,966
It is painless,
after the initial discomfort

76
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,904
but I'm afraid you'll be dead
within the hour.

77
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:46,656
There.

78
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:51,085
Now, you will tell me everything
you know about the Falarica

79
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:55,095
and the one who guards it.

80
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,525
I'm sorry I brought you
into this child.

81
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:00,996
You shouldn't concern yourself

82
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,663
with such things.
Your father would not have wished it.

83
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:05,102
Aunt, I'm not a child anymore.

84
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,171
Stay calm, girl.

85
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:18,678
You have a pass?

86
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:35,562
Where are you traveling?

87
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,032
The Leode of Ghel.

88
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,237
We bear candles for the sisters.

89
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,538
With no servants?

90
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:43,436
They ran off,

91
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:46,446
taking everything you lot
hadn't already burned or stolen.

92
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,576
Forgive her.

93
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:49,543
She was raised with indulgence and

94
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,255
forgets the inevitabilities
of occupation.

95
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,016
Ithirst.

96
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,424
No, not you. You.

97
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,177
Here, your wine.

98
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,652
Sclabia!

99
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,897
Scum! On your feet!

100
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,164
I said on your feet!

101
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,740
Elenn. Go.

102
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:06,896
Come on!

103
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,137
I'll kill you.

104
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:43,895
Lief! Get the horse!

105
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,367
You killed my aunt.

106
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,508
Whatevefis in that sack
of yours killed your aunt.

107
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:55,907
Now cover the body.

108
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,055
You know my orders, Corvus.
Request denied.

109
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,518
The information is reliable.

110
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,692
The woman who bears the Falarica

111
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:15,129
is likely headed south
towards Anondea.

112
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,468
The rebels are going to crown Garrick.

113
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,131
- A dozen men...
- Garrick!

114
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,337
I'd have thought he was too busy
wooing sheep

115
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,501
- and stealing Vitalion wine.
- Allow a coronation,

116
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:29,142
and the rebellion will become
a full-fledged Deiran uprising.

117
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,473
<i>You are Magma,</i>

118
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,445
they're your people
and soon to be your problem,

119
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,280
you deal with it!

120
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,855
To enforce the law,
I must have soldiers!

121
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,616
Indeed.

122
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,625
Do you know where this supposed
coronation is being held?

123
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,688
No.

124
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,890
Do you have any information

125
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:51,297
that could conceivably lead
to Garrick's death or capture?

126
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,263
No.

127
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,036
Perhaps it has escaped
your attention Corvus

128
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,537
but this Legion
is being transferred north.

129
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,372
Deira is nothing

130
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,343
more than a muddy little footprint
on the road to Minneaus.

131
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:08,477
A united Deira would present
a problem in the future.

132
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,881
The dragon will make that difficult,

133
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,654
may the Gods forgive us.

134
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:16,058
The Deiran should be suitably
terrorized for years to come

135
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,653
and Garrick would be king all of a day

136
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:22,291
before his Deiran "allies"
cut his throat.

137
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,700
Request denied.

138
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:11,877
Hey beautiful.

139
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,672
Goodbye, little one.

140
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:54,991
Oh, no, no.

141
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,016
No!

142
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:02,427
No!

143
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,369
Leave her be!

144
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:14,978
If it means that much to you,
then you go first.

145
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,674
But do us a favor,
don't use her all up.

146
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,044
I'd like a little fight left for my turn.

147
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,093
Gods, woman! Leave it.

148
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,626
You don't believe
that cock n' bull story

149
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,732
that she fed the scales do you?
She's a thieving little whore,

150
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,362
run off with her master's treasure,

151
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,299
like every other sewing
Wench in the country.

152
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,169
I won't say it again, Leif.

153
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:47,342
After all we've been through,
you take some giglefs pan over me?

154
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,777
And here we were gonna be partners?

155
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,552
There's plenty
of sympathizers blood to spill,

156
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,016
plenty of plunder,

157
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:01,516
and women.

158
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:03,850
I've got enough blood on my hands.

159
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:07,357
Whafll you do Aedin, try farming?

160
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,161
My father was a farmer.

161
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,694
So was mine,

162
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:14,700
and the happiest day of his life
was on the one the poor bastard died.

163
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:19,366
Well, if we're to pad,

164
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,304
let it be in friendship. Eh?

165
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,283
Come here.

166
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:36,284
No bastard holds a knife to my throat.

167
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,460
I'll not forget.

168
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,398
- Another time, m'lady.
- To hell with you!

169
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:49,766
Like enough,

170
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,433
but not this day.

171
00:13:57,703 --> 00:13:59,046
Hedge-born villain!

172
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:02,886
He wasn't always that way.

173
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,849
War an' what comes after
changes some men.

174
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:12,151
This is yours.

175
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:15,130
I'm sorry for whatever pan
I played in your aunt's death.

176
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,103
It ain't safe for you here.

177
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:25,306
Just get past Butcher's Creek,
then join the road again.

178
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:27,009
Fare well, lass.

179
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:31,048
Please, please, I need to get to Ghel.

180
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,542
Can you help me?

181
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:34,745
I've got my own problems.

182
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,611
- I am Elenn of Adair...
- I'm no son of escort

183
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,248
Ghel's dangerous.

184
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,424
Still crawling with Vitalion patrols,
thick as fleas on rats.

185
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:43,720
And they'll be lookin' for me.

186
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,489
If it weren't for me you'd still be bound
and heading for the gallows.

187
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:50,128
I'm grateful, but I know enough
not to stick my head back in the noose.

188
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,260
My life's worth more than that.
Sorry, lass.

189
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:56,969
My aunt owned a large tract of land
south of Queen's Ford.

190
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:00,707
It takes a full day to ride the perimeter.
It's mine now.

191
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,108
I'll give you all you can ride around
in the morning

192
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,875
if you can take me to the Leode
at Ghel in three days.

193
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,282
It'd take two days to get to Ghel...

194
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:17,292
off the road for a man.

195
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:19,526
In battle condition.

196
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,258
Hard country between here and Ghel.
You think you're up to it?

197
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:23,466
Yes.

198
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:28,695
All right. What's on the table?

199
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,596
What?

200
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,833
What can you give me now.
As security.

201
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,441
In the case that you can't keep
your temper,

202
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,240
you claw up some face
I can't scare off with a pen knife?

203
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,142
Here. It's all I have.

204
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:44,982
I can trade it for coin
when we get to Ghel.

205
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,283
What's in there?

206
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,423
It's not mine to give...

207
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,099
A full morning, you say?

208
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,794
Sun up to noon.

209
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,804
- I choose the horse.
- Well, then I need an oath.

210
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:17,987
On the haft and hilt,

211
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,853
lam thy man and soldier.

212
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,089
The name's Aedin.

213
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,056
- Elenn Barethon.
- Aye, you said.

214
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,864
Now stick to the trees.

215
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,508


216
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,709
You're heavier than you look.

217
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,339
Pretty dress. Shame about the color.

218
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:05,054
What are you doing?!

219
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,956
Keep moving princess,
we've got a long way to yet.

220
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:37,440
A plague of fire.

221
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:41,640
Aye .

222
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,058
Dammit!

223
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:14,439
Gods in hell...

224
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,376
Thieving bastard!

225
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,978
- Careful.
- Give it back!

226
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,242
Not till you answer some questions.

227
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,411
Now put that thing away
before you get lucky.

228
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,849
How the hell did you get this thing?

229
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:30,726
Who are you?
And don't give me any she-tahn

230
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,452
about joining the Leode of virgins.

231
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:12,794
Elenn, run! Get out of here!

232
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:21,044
Aedin, come on! Run! Run!

233
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:46,535
What in hell's name is that thing?
Black magic?

234
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,439
Who's after you?

235
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,440
Come on!

236
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,862
You got any magic for this?

237
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:46,051
Oh shi...

238
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:54,422
I've got you.

239
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:11,743
What the hell have you drug me into?

240
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:19,654
Take off your wet clothes.

241
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:25,458
How'd you find this place?

242
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:30,023
I have a network of caches along
all the major trade routes.

243
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,164
- You're a smuggler.
- Yep.

244
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:34,731
And you're a liar.

245
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,644
What else is
in that little hole of yours?

246
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:02,328
You fought in the war
with King Aedelred,

247
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:04,861
was he as beautiful as they say?

248
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:06,661
I don't know.

249
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:10,300
I spent most of my time
buried in a trench,

250
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,533
trying to keep my feet dry
and my head out of dragon fire.

251
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:16,136
What did you do after the war?

252
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:18,609
After the invasion...

253
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,876
like most I kept fighting
long past sense.

254
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,715
When I went home
there was nothing left.

255
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,225
So, I fight other men's battles now,

256
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,657
and pick up things
on my travels when I can.

257
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:42,396
It's been a life of little meaning.

258
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:49,706
Well I think it sounds romantic,

259
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,481
always on the run,

260
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,385
living by your swords and your wits.

261
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,359
You're full of wine and a warm fire.

262
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:11,963
Come the morning you'll remember
the misery and loneliness.

263
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:18,368
Get some rest.

264
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:19,835
We've an early start

265
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:29,610
It's going to get more dangerous
from here.

266
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:33,420
We're moving into dragon territory.
We'll have to stay to the trees.

267
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:47,862
We're in its territory now, keep still.

268
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,173
We'll be safe for now.

269
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:56,936
What else are you keeping from me?

270
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:02,483
This better be the best bloody
farmland in Deira.

271
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:10,985
Do you think it's gone?

272
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:12,855
Maybe so, maybe no.

273
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:14,622
We never could figure
the damn thing out.

274
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:16,527
Neither could the Vitalions
for that matter.

275
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:19,262
Only a Paladin can kill a dragon...

276
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,265
Well, we didn't have one handy
at the time.

277
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:26,633
Last night... late last night. Did we...

278
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:29,242
did I say anything... you know.

279
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,573
I always say too much
when I'm drunk.

280
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:33,978
No. Nothing I can think of.

281
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:36,679
Did we do anything...

282
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,680
Nope. Nothing.

283
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,717
You'll live to die a virgin yet.

284
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:51,097
- Help!
- Keep yellin', that'll fix it.

285
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:12,052
Clooney, it's been so long.

286
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,120
Son of a whore!

287
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:18,960
That's for Dunotten.

288
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:20,894
Bastard tried to kill me.

289
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,690
Stuck a sword right through my side.

290
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:26,763
You left out the pan
where you were standing on my head,

291
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,468
in three feet of water.

292
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:31,263
Aye. I did.
He was fighting for the enemy.

293
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,703
- The Vitalion?
- No. The Daegen's.

294
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,204
May they rot in hell.

295
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:38,243
They did, right after you set fire
to their keep.

296
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:43,642
Aye. They were bra times.

297
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,685
I missed ya. Come and sit.

298
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,819
My wives shall entertain you.

299
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:50,921
With what little we have.

300
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:52,857
Wives?

301
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,364
If you want to see that horn again,
don't mention the coronation.

302
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,821
How about becoming more agreeable
before you get us both disemboweled.

303
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:55,285
From where I was sitting it looked like
you were being agreeable

304
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:56,586
enough for the both of us.

305
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:59,251
When the laird's had enough
to turn sad and sentimental,

306
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,490
I'll get the horn and we'll slip away.

307
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,096
I know this tune.

308
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:09,500
My mother used to hum it.

309
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,973
It's an old song. About ties.

310
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:20,742
Ties that hold things:

311
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:24,576
people, ideas,
strong ties and weaker ones.

312
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:32,153
It's a sad thing now, but before
the war it was a song for lovers.

313
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:42,931
Don't let go.

314
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:57,940
Enough!
Lace those peckers away, boys!

315
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:00,146
There's dark deeds need doing.

316
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:02,743
You too, Aedin. I'm not asking.

317
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:07,923
What are we after tonight?

318
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:10,925
Trelawneys.
It was them who sold me out!

319
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:23,404
I see some one.
Shut it, ya wee turds.

320
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,536
There's one of them now!

321
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:32,780
Sneak up and give him
a little taste of the 0l' iron.

322
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:37,986
Why me?

323
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:41,486
Because you're my guest
and took advantage of my hospitality.

324
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,584
Now give me your sword,

325
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:46,458
we wouldn't want it rattling
and give you up.

326
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:54,064
We're right behind you.

327
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:06,758
Who goes there?

328
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,412
You're pretty good with a stick.

329
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:26,887
You can thank me later!
I've got the horn.

330
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:35,454
Slow down, you're going to fast,
I can't keep up.

331
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:43,963
How much further?

332
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:52,136
Oh.

333
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:22,001
Enter.

334
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:28,440
Leave us.

335
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:42,023
I understand you have information
on a young woman

336
00:38:42,086 --> 00:38:44,623
traveling with a smuggler
acquaintance of yours?

337
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:51,368
The Vitalions treat you pretty well
for a Deiran, don't they?

338
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,044
I'm sorry child.

339
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:09,283
Your aunt was a keeper
of our Lore and magic.

340
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:12,459
Hers is a terrible loss...

341
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:17,132
Garrick will be crowned
at dawn on Lama's Eve.

342
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,495
As a Barethon
the task might naturally...

343
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:24,903
The coronation...
I'm afraid I am unversed...

344
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:27,204
My aunt was the protector.

345
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:30,075
She didn't even want me
to come on this journey.

346
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:32,478
I failed to learn the magic
I was taught.

347
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:36,415
If my aunt had born a child,

348
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,983
I'm sure it would have been the one...

349
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:41,586
Faith requires courage Elenn.

350
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,918
You must have faith

351
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:47,688
to find the path that is laid
out before you

352
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,161
and to find the courage to step onto it.

353
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:55,263
The sisters are preparing
for the Vigil of the Paladin tonight.

354
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,197
The acolytes
have prepared a bath for you.

355
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:02,209
You must be tired, after your ordeal.

356
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,052
Oh.

357
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:24,725
One days morning.

358
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:47,061
They await the Paladin.

359
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:52,070
The prophecy says the warrior
will manifest at mid moon,

360
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:55,140
enter the circle and save the Dairen.

361
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:59,247
A hero of great faith,

362
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,879
with the power to walk through fire.

363
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,455
It's yours.

364
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:34,580
Am I to wait all night
to have my bowl refilled? Do I?

365
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:48,221
I used to spend hours here
when I was a little girl.

366
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,161
My father would hold me on his lap

367
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:53,565
and read me stories
as I turned the pages...

368
00:44:58,529 --> 00:44:59,906
Over here is Anyon,

369
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:02,544
the first king of the Deiran's.

370
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:07,672
As he stood before his victorious army
and raised his sword aloft,

371
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,478
the lightning gods filled him
with power,

372
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,020
his boots melted
the stone beneath his feet.

373
00:45:18,015 --> 00:45:19,016
Two dragons;

374
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,087
one poisons the land,

375
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,123
the other heals it.

376
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:27,696
Do you believe that?

377
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:31,204
My father said
that they were just stories.

378
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:36,640
You're leaving tomorrow...

379
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:39,979
Aye...

380
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:43,351
Will you be joining the sister's then?

381
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,512
They'll keep me here, no doubt.

382
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:51,993
Just long enough to see
my aunt's wishes fulfilled and me

383
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:54,120
the pretty wife
of some influential laird.

384
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:56,426
Aye...

385
00:45:57,287 --> 00:45:58,561
someone clean.

386
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,194
Aye .

387
00:46:57,548 --> 00:46:59,221
The deed has been prepared.

388
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:45,134
You are a Paladin.

389
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:56,083
To crown the dragon,
you must first kill the dragon.

390
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:42,953
Paladin.

391
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:09,622
Gods, the Paladin.

392
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:15,362
The Paladin is here!

393
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:23,332
The Paladin.

394
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,400
Bring me the girl.

395
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:00,598
Alive and unharmed.

396
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:33,039
What's happening? Is she hurt?

397
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:35,440
She has begun the glyderinge,
her dream quest.

398
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,306
- She's the Paladin.
- What?

399
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,013
There' no time to spare.

400
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:59,391
You must take her to the hermit
on the shores of Lough Aislinn.

401
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:01,326
She must undergo her anointing.

402
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:04,372
Aedin, you must take care of her.

403
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:06,703
Her fulfillment has drawn the Dragon.

404
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:09,035
The two are now linked.

405
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:12,245
It won't rest until one
destroys the other.

406
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:15,008
You're a pan of this now, Aedin.

407
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:17,743
Blessings of the Gods be on you. Go!

408
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:29,493
We have to keep moving.

409
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:34,768
Traitor!

410
00:52:09,926 --> 00:52:11,303
We need to move faster.

411
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:24,745
Get back.

412
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:26,179
Elenn.

413
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:27,880
Back.

414
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:17,968
Come on.

415
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:24,042
If it catches our scent
we won't out run it.

416
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:46,967
We've got to keep moving.

417
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:50,998
Come on. Just a little bit further.

418
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:22,020
We're there.

419
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,098
Hey!

420
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:34,706
Hey!

421
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:37,844
What do you want?

422
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:43,541
Oh no! Don't you bring
your troubles around here!

423
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,419
We've come from the Leode!

424
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:48,213
I don't care where you come from!

425
00:55:48,478 --> 00:55:50,651
Take your strumpet and piss off!

426
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:56,257
We're coming in.

427
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,402
What you do... What's going on?

428
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:11,774
What's going on?
Those are precious artifacts.

429
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,745
- So is she.
- What's happening?

430
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:16,275
She's its keeper.
She's entered the glyderinge.

431
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:20,518
Gods above!

432
00:56:23,813 --> 00:56:25,884
- The Paladin...
- You've got to finish the ceremony.

433
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:28,261
We haven't much time. Candles!

434
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:34,567
Celyn berries! Do you know them?

435
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:37,103
She's going to die, man! Quick!

436
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,054
Leif.

437
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:32,548
I should have known.

438
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:37,988
Hello again, old man.

439
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:39,817
I've told you,
I have nothing more to sell you.

440
00:58:41,317 --> 00:58:42,728
Hello, old friend.

441
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:46,690
Looks like you turned traitor.

442
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:51,166
No, it's about revenge.

443
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:56,606
- Where are your new friends?
- Where's the girl?

444
00:58:57,433 --> 00:58:58,503
Miles from here.

445
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:02,641
For a smuggler,
you always were a terrible liar.

446
00:59:03,106 --> 00:59:04,676
You can still just turn and walk away.

447
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:05,984
No, no.

448
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:08,188
I've been looking forward to this.

449
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:25,370
Is this the glyderinge?

450
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:30,443
Remarkable.

451
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:14,212
Like all your battles, Aedin,

452
01:00:14,677 --> 01:00:17,055
this is one you cannot win.
Now tell me where's the girl.

453
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:18,821
Defiant to the last.

454
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:20,960
That girl just killed you.

455
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:40,405
Oh no.

456
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:46,970
Where is she?

457
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:48,643
He took her.

458
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:51,151
I've sold him many things
in the past...

459
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:56,719
Didn't think I had magic
left to pluck his birds.

460
01:01:58,047 --> 01:01:59,025
Is she alive?

461
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:02,561
The Glyderinge... not finished.

462
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:04,429
She's fragile...

463
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:06,894
may not wake.

464
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:36,119
Elenn.

465
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:40,557
Wake up.

466
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:42,724
It's the latest fashion in Rhona,
I believe.

467
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:52,397
I am Corvus of Renonia.

468
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:55,306
You are Corvus the traitor.

469
01:03:56,365 --> 01:03:58,709
Born into a family of Deiran nobility.

470
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:04,044
My father, in his wisdom,
made himself useful to the Emperor,

471
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:07,086
and I spent my youth
and education abroad.

472
01:04:08,945 --> 01:04:11,482
I have seen so many things Elenn.

473
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:19,459
Magicians in Hoﬂonium who summon up
dueling beast of horrific size,

474
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:21,966
only often to be devoured themselves,

475
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:28,233
Sarinese shaman who lie facedown
on glowing coals, unscathed.

476
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,074
However,

477
01:04:32,602 --> 01:04:37,813
none have intrigued me
more than this.

478
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:41,282
The missing pad!

479
01:04:42,078 --> 01:04:45,491
I have soared for so many years
to make it whole,

480
01:04:47,149 --> 01:04:48,492
and at a great cost.

481
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:56,695
The blood of one dragon
shall anoint the other,

482
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,804
and the land shall be healed.

483
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:03,338
What do you want from me?

484
01:05:05,134 --> 01:05:06,340
In my hands,

485
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:09,238
it's just an old unicorn horn,

486
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:11,578
broken,

487
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:13,683
inert

488
01:05:14,877 --> 01:05:18,689
but reunited in the hands
of an anointed Deiran priestess,

489
01:05:19,015 --> 01:05:20,824
the last of her kind...

490
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:25,055
It is a vessel of immense power.

491
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:28,563
Don't you see?

492
01:05:29,325 --> 01:05:32,772
Me, to collect the necessary pieces.

493
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:38,038
You, to fulfill your destiny
and reunite the Falarica.

494
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:42,677
I knew it when I saw you in Ghel,
and I know it now,

495
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:45,045
seeing you here
before these two pieces.

496
01:05:45,908 --> 01:05:49,219
It is to this purpose
that you have been anointed.

497
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:51,686
You know nothing of my destiny.

498
01:05:53,983 --> 01:05:55,018
You are wrong.

499
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:02,135
Take the girl.

500
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:08,129
This is no longer a Vitalion matter!

501
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,404
You are beginning to vex me Corvus.

502
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:11,843
This relic, this girl, they are nothing.

503
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:15,013
Burning religiouswomen
does not stop revolutions,

504
01:06:15,237 --> 01:06:16,375
quite the opposite.

505
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:18,818
The girl will be executed immediately.

506
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:22,051
What is the charge?

507
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:29,095
- Treason and sedition.
- You have no evidence.

508
01:06:29,585 --> 01:06:32,088
Two weeks ago you were bleating
on about a mountain of evidence!

509
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:33,326
There is none.

510
01:06:33,923 --> 01:06:35,197
<i>Magma Corvus'</i>

511
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:38,198
you are very close to finding
yourself at the end of a big pike.

512
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:40,204
I petition for trial by combat.

513
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,341
I have no interest
in your primitive Deiran custom.

514
01:06:43,432 --> 01:06:44,934
As you are aware,

515
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:48,139
the Vitalion have agreed
to observe certain Deiran laws.

516
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:51,385
She comes from a noble family.
There is no evidence.

517
01:06:51,607 --> 01:06:54,110
Trial by combat must be observed.

518
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:55,784
Very well, Corvus.

519
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:57,855
She shall have her trial by combat.

520
01:06:58,447 --> 01:07:02,486
But you shall represent the interests
of the Empire in this, not hers!

521
01:07:04,086 --> 01:07:05,463
She shall have three days.

522
01:07:05,988 --> 01:07:07,865
And if a champion doesn't emerge

523
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:10,060
she will be executed.

524
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:13,837
If they do,
you will battle them to the death.

525
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:16,509
Win, and she dies.

526
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:19,012
Lose, and she's free.

527
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:22,806
Three days.

528
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:34,353
We've got a heavy one here.

529
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:38,530
Don't you die on your own,
I want to kill you myself.

530
01:07:40,156 --> 01:07:41,157
Night, night.

531
01:08:19,895 --> 01:08:21,203
Am I where I think I am?

532
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:24,010
Depends...
Do you think you're in heaven?

533
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:25,837
No.

534
01:08:27,369 --> 01:08:28,677
Then yes.

535
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:31,040
Sleep.

536
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:33,844
He wants you rested,
so he can kill you properly.

537
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,725
Tell Clooney...

538
01:08:41,317 --> 01:08:42,762
Barethon's girl...

539
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:45,261
She's the Paladin.

540
01:08:53,195 --> 01:08:54,401
Come with me Elenn.

541
01:08:54,597 --> 01:08:55,735
I can get you out.

542
01:08:58,434 --> 01:08:59,412
Why should you?

543
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:04,446
Because a vibrance
and an instinct like yours is so rare.

544
01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:08,486
I will not...

545
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:11,491
I can not let them take you from me.

546
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:15,618
No.

547
01:09:19,288 --> 01:09:20,961
Strabus will see me fall.

548
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:25,103
Forget this land,
forget these people, forget the dragon.

549
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:30,900
I want to take you to a place
where none of this matters.

550
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:35,139
No.

551
01:09:36,205 --> 01:09:38,344
What difference is your death
going to make?

552
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,011
Well more than my life will
if I leave with you.

553
01:09:47,716 --> 01:09:49,354
I have petitioned for trial by combat,

554
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:51,259
but I've been forced to fight
for the Emperor.

555
01:09:52,655 --> 01:09:54,657
If no champion comes forward
by noon tomorrow,

556
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:57,265
you will be executed.

557
01:10:00,496 --> 01:10:02,032
Gods above, woman!

558
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:05,003
No champion is coming!

559
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:07,837
Do you know what they'll do to you?

560
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:12,013
For the last time,

561
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:15,044
I beg you,

562
01:10:16,011 --> 01:10:17,718
come with me
and forget this foolishness.

563
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:22,527
Then you'll die,

564
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:26,361
Lama's Eve will pass,
and Garrick will not be crowned.

565
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:00,864
Clooney!

566
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:05,396
Clooney you bastard, set me free!

567
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:12,741
Clooney!

568
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:34,367
Aedin!

569
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:40,104
It seems your lass needs a champion.

570
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:42,609
They're going to execute her
without one.

571
01:12:00,783 --> 01:12:01,921
Elenn of Adair,

572
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:05,659
you are charged with the crimes
of sedition and treason,

573
01:12:06,088 --> 01:12:08,125
for which you will be executed.

574
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:10,563
How do you plead?

575
01:12:12,761 --> 01:12:13,967
I do not plead.

576
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:16,810
I am a Deiran.

577
01:12:17,132 --> 01:12:20,375
And you are in a Deiran fortress
upon Deiran lands!

578
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:31,787
Very pretty for a Deiran girl.

579
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:39,963
No plea.

580
01:12:40,589 --> 01:12:43,365
A trial by combat
has been petitioned on your behalf,

581
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:45,903
and it seems that a champion
has emerged.

582
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:48,604
Bring out the prisoner!

583
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:01,987
Pretty dress.

584
01:13:03,078 --> 01:13:04,216
I like the color.

585
01:13:06,915 --> 01:13:08,758
And do you accept this man
as your champion?

586
01:13:10,085 --> 01:13:11,155
Yes.

587
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:14,193
So be it! Trial by combat!

588
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:20,271
Bring that bitch to heel
and then throw her back in her cage.

589
01:13:24,366 --> 01:13:25,743
Let go of me.

590
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,463
I did not expect such fervor
from Corvus.

591
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:02,408
He seems quite taken by the girl.

592
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:05,543
Survival is still the stronger
instinct Strabus.

593
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:23,356
Who is she?

594
01:15:23,585 --> 01:15:25,030
A Deiran witch.

595
01:15:25,587 --> 01:15:28,261
She has an old horn
that Corvus was truly obsessed about.

596
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:31,134
He calls it the Falarica, I believe.

597
01:15:52,915 --> 01:15:55,020
It is significant to the Deiran Kings?

598
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:59,957
The Emperor has interest
in royal artifacts.

599
01:16:01,023 --> 01:16:03,526
The man who brings him the horn
would be smiled upon.

600
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:06,767
Do you have it?

601
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:57,218
Vitalion justice!

602
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:59,081
Finish it!

603
01:17:32,614 --> 01:17:33,922
To kill the dragon

604
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:37,257
she must unite the horn...

605
01:17:42,391 --> 01:17:44,894
It is her...

606
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:48,030
destiny.

607
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:10,954
I am almost grateful to you
for ridding me of the traitor.

608
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:13,091
Throw him to the dogs.

609
01:18:53,829 --> 01:18:55,001
That's the problem with you Deiran.

610
01:18:55,363 --> 01:18:57,707
You never have the good sense
to stop when you're beaten.

611
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:05,611
Elenn?!

612
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:08,013
The dragon!

613
01:19:09,544 --> 01:19:11,421
We need to get to the Summit
of lliak by dawn.

614
01:19:11,613 --> 01:19:12,990
- Why?
- The coronation.

615
01:19:37,072 --> 01:19:38,278
Grab that horse.

616
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:51,122
Faster, come on!

617
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,391
We cross into open ground,
we're dead.

618
01:20:20,682 --> 01:20:22,093
It's me the dragon's after.

619
01:20:26,288 --> 01:20:28,996
Here, take this to the coronation.

620
01:20:32,894 --> 01:20:34,339
Corvus said you must unite the horn.

621
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:43,141
What are you doing?

622
01:20:45,407 --> 01:20:46,613
You're the Paladin.

623
01:20:47,075 --> 01:20:48,315
You'll think of something.

624
01:20:49,244 --> 01:20:50,416
Wish me luck.

625
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:53,258
Luck?

626
01:26:58,046 --> 01:26:59,320
The coronation.

627
01:27:00,315 --> 01:27:03,023
I need an escort to take me
to the Summit of lliak before dawn.

628
01:27:04,552 --> 01:27:07,294
It'll take till sunset, for a man,

629
01:27:08,089 --> 01:27:09,466
in battle condition.

630
01:27:12,093 --> 01:27:13,504
Don't let go.
