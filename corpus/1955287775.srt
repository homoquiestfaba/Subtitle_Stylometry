1
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:25,718
Rachel, I'm home.

2
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,884
That's my mom.

3
00:01:27,812 --> 00:01:28,821
Would you relax!

4
00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:33,791
It's too dark in here.

5
00:01:33,824 --> 00:01:35,393
I'm opening the shades.

6
00:01:35,426 --> 00:01:36,794
No. No.

7
00:01:36,828 --> 00:01:40,366
I don't want to give my mom or the
rest of the neighborhood a show.

8
00:01:42,934 --> 00:01:45,170
Let's give them a thrill?

9
00:01:45,202 --> 00:01:46,705
Just, please.

10
00:01:47,538 --> 00:01:49,307
Anything for you, baby.

11
00:01:50,908 --> 00:01:52,143
Damn.

12
00:01:52,843 --> 00:01:54,479
You are so hot.

13
00:01:55,146 --> 00:01:57,416
I can't believe I never saw you
at my games in high school.

14
00:01:57,449 --> 00:02:00,285
I was there. I was just...
I was in the bleachers.

15
00:02:00,318 --> 00:02:01,854
With the rest of
the band geeks.

16
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:03,255
Yeah?

17
00:02:03,288 --> 00:02:05,291
In your tight little uniform.

18
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,325
Watching me.

19
00:02:09,426 --> 00:02:10,394
Where is that uniform?

20
00:02:10,428 --> 00:02:12,264
You should put it
on for me.

21
00:02:12,297 --> 00:02:13,899
We are not in
high school anymore.

22
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:16,901
And one of us isn't
even in college.

23
00:02:16,935 --> 00:02:18,270
Hey.

24
00:02:18,303 --> 00:02:19,739
Hey.

25
00:02:20,172 --> 00:02:21,407
Come here.

26
00:02:32,383 --> 00:02:34,218
It's okay.

27
00:02:34,251 --> 00:02:35,453
Alright.

28
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:39,191
How do you do that?

29
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,493
Do what?

30
00:02:41,859 --> 00:02:44,229
Just kiss me and make
everything better.

31
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:00,512
Who are you texting?

32
00:03:00,544 --> 00:03:02,247
It's nobody.

33
00:03:02,513 --> 00:03:03,714
It's my mom.

34
00:03:03,749 --> 00:03:07,085
You stop making out with your
girlfriend to text your mom?

35
00:03:07,118 --> 00:03:09,187
Like you haven't
done it before?

36
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:10,021
That... That's different.
My mom's...

37
00:03:10,055 --> 00:03:12,424
Loud. Pushy.
Pain in the...

38
00:03:12,456 --> 00:03:14,226
Protective.

39
00:03:14,859 --> 00:03:16,362
Protective.

40
00:03:17,863 --> 00:03:20,132
Tell your mom I said hi.

41
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:23,536
Smile.
What? No!

42
00:03:23,968 --> 00:03:25,103
No.
Babe.

43
00:03:25,137 --> 00:03:27,506
I want something to make my
friends jealous. Come on.

44
00:03:27,538 --> 00:03:29,407
No way! Get out.
No.

45
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:31,977
Alright.
I'm just kidding.

46
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:33,411
You know I won't do that.

47
00:03:36,914 --> 00:03:39,285
Look, I want something to take
back with me in the fall.

48
00:03:39,584 --> 00:03:40,551
You know me, I'm ride
or die for you.

49
00:03:40,585 --> 00:03:43,589
But these college girls,
they come at me hard.

50
00:03:45,055 --> 00:03:47,892
I need something to remind me
of what I got.

51
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:55,868
Give me a smile.

52
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:58,571
Come on, just a little one.

53
00:04:03,942 --> 00:04:05,477
What?

54
00:04:06,511 --> 00:04:09,580
You won't show this
to anybody.

55
00:04:09,614 --> 00:04:10,949
Baby?

56
00:04:10,982 --> 00:04:12,017
It's me.

57
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:13,285
Come on.

58
00:04:15,954 --> 00:04:18,323
Come on.
Yeah, that's it.

59
00:04:24,328 --> 00:04:25,563
That's it.

60
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,936
Yeah.

61
00:04:32,703 --> 00:04:34,405
Alright, look sexy.

62
00:04:41,378 --> 00:04:43,614
Drop there. Right there.

63
00:04:53,725 --> 00:04:55,027
Yeah.

64
00:04:55,059 --> 00:04:58,429
-Doing it.
-Pose.

65
00:04:58,462 --> 00:04:59,898
Yeah.

66
00:05:01,499 --> 00:05:03,936
Yeah. Come on.

67
00:05:04,402 --> 00:05:05,604
You know what?
Just take it off.

68
00:05:05,636 --> 00:05:07,471
Just take it off.

69
00:05:07,504 --> 00:05:09,674
No.

70
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:23,522
Now we're talking.

71
00:05:26,558 --> 00:05:28,327
That's good.
That's good.

72
00:05:31,643 --> 00:05:34,943
<b>REVENGE PORN
Subrip: Pix</b>

73
00:05:45,744 --> 00:05:47,979
Troy! Troy! What are you
doing? Stop! Stop!

74
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:48,981
What? I know
you're ticklish.

75
00:05:57,789 --> 00:05:59,991
Fine, I gotta take
a leak anyway.

76
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:10,736
What you doing?

77
00:06:10,768 --> 00:06:12,670
What is this text?

78
00:06:12,703 --> 00:06:15,573
God, you have no chill.

79
00:06:16,441 --> 00:06:18,744
What happened to
trusting me?

80
00:06:18,777 --> 00:06:20,346
And how am I supposed
to trust you?

81
00:06:22,013 --> 00:06:25,549
Okay. Had so much fun with you. Can't wait
until the next time I feel your rock hard...

82
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,518
I - I can't even read the rest
of this.

83
00:06:27,551 --> 00:06:30,155
What are you doing Troy?!
Why did you do this to us?

84
00:06:30,188 --> 00:06:33,491
We're not really exclusive.
Right? Come here.

85
00:06:33,525 --> 00:06:35,626
Are you serious?
Okay, then who else?

86
00:06:36,427 --> 00:06:37,762
Rachel.

87
00:06:37,796 --> 00:06:39,498
Can I please have
my phone back?

88
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:40,499
Rachel!

89
00:06:40,532 --> 00:06:42,700
Rachel give me
my phone back.

90
00:06:42,734 --> 00:06:44,202
Rachel!

91
00:06:44,234 --> 00:06:46,138
Rachel, open the door.

92
00:06:47,472 --> 00:06:49,041
Rachel!

93
00:06:49,073 --> 00:06:51,575
Give me
my phone back.

94
00:06:53,611 --> 00:06:55,614
Rachel!

95
00:06:57,114 --> 00:06:58,382
Rachel!

96
00:06:58,415 --> 00:07:00,818
Can I have my phone,
please?

97
00:07:00,852 --> 00:07:02,721
Rachel!

98
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:07,726
Look, I'm trash. I know! Would you please
come out of the bathroom and talk, baby?

99
00:07:12,097 --> 00:07:13,499
You said you erased them?

100
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,768
Yeah, I was gonna take them to
college with me, remember?

101
00:07:16,801 --> 00:07:21,205
As a reminder of my girl? No but I changed
my mind and you said you erased them.

102
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:22,774
What else are
you lying to me about?

103
00:07:29,213 --> 00:07:32,483
Look, if you want them
gone, they're gone.

104
00:07:34,652 --> 00:07:36,121
Boom.

105
00:07:37,489 --> 00:07:38,756
Good.

106
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:40,225
Now I want you gone too.

107
00:07:40,258 --> 00:07:41,693
Baby.

108
00:07:43,227 --> 00:07:44,662
Come on.

109
00:07:44,696 --> 00:07:46,097
Are you okay?

110
00:07:47,232 --> 00:07:49,501
Look, I love you!

111
00:07:49,534 --> 00:07:50,301
That's the truth.

112
00:07:50,335 --> 00:07:52,237
No you don't, Troy.

113
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,506
You just want to check
me off your list.

114
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:56,274
I...
And you did.

115
00:07:56,306 --> 00:07:57,407
So, get out.

116
00:07:57,441 --> 00:08:00,211
What?! Well we never...
Mother: Okay, you know what?

117
00:08:00,244 --> 00:08:02,646
I want you the hell out of
my house.

118
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:06,150
Hey! Get off
of me! Hey!

119
00:08:11,922 --> 00:08:16,494
Big mistake, bitch! Don't take another
step or I will call the cops, okay?

120
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:17,696
Don't push me.

121
00:08:20,564 --> 00:08:22,567
You're going to regret
this, Rachel.

122
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,269
You got too fat anyway.
You know what?

123
00:08:25,302 --> 00:08:28,874
Why don't you go shave your
chest some more. You loser.

124
00:08:28,907 --> 00:08:30,174
Yeah.

125
00:08:36,714 --> 00:08:39,518
Rach, you okay?
Yeah.

126
00:08:41,853 --> 00:08:44,189
I just, did not see that coming.

127
00:08:44,221 --> 00:08:45,789
Honey.

128
00:08:45,822 --> 00:08:47,191
This is a good thing.

129
00:08:47,225 --> 00:08:48,893
I know that it hurts
right now.

130
00:08:48,926 --> 00:08:51,296
But I promise you, time heals
everything.

131
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:54,133
It's going to be okay.
Come here.

132
00:08:54,798 --> 00:08:57,168
It sucks.

133
00:08:57,201 --> 00:08:58,537
I know.

134
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,941
We never liked him anyway.

135
00:09:02,974 --> 00:09:05,477
It's going to be okay, babe.

136
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:08,913
I love you.
I love you too.

137
00:09:21,825 --> 00:09:23,295
You're better off without him.

138
00:09:23,894 --> 00:09:25,062
I know.

139
00:09:25,095 --> 00:09:27,865
Guys like that get aggressive.
And then they get abusive.

140
00:09:27,898 --> 00:09:29,066
You don't need that
in your life.

141
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,269
Next year you'll have enough
money to go to conservatory,

142
00:09:32,302 --> 00:09:34,306
and there will be
other boys there.

143
00:09:34,638 --> 00:09:35,874
Yeah.

144
00:09:35,907 --> 00:09:36,975
I just thought that, you know,

145
00:09:37,008 --> 00:09:40,345
by now I'd be running from class
to class on campus.

146
00:09:40,378 --> 00:09:41,879
And fight over practice rooms.

147
00:09:41,912 --> 00:09:44,349
Not here. Getting cheated on.

148
00:09:44,382 --> 00:09:46,351
And wiping coffee stains
off my bra.

149
00:09:46,383 --> 00:09:48,720
The job is part
of the plan.

150
00:09:48,753 --> 00:09:50,222
You wanted to go to the best
school.

151
00:09:50,254 --> 00:09:52,590
And sometimes the
best takes more.

152
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:55,661
Yeah, I'm living the dream.

153
00:10:04,768 --> 00:10:05,703
Hey, Sherry.

154
00:10:05,736 --> 00:10:10,407
What do you call birds that
stick together?

155
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:11,776
I don't know.

156
00:10:11,808 --> 00:10:12,977
Vel-crows.

157
00:10:13,911 --> 00:10:16,582
You get it? Vel-crow?

158
00:10:16,814 --> 00:10:19,284
Ryan, the jokes are tired.
They creep everyone out.

159
00:10:19,316 --> 00:10:20,719
Especially me.

160
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:25,757
I meant "creep" as a compliment.

161
00:10:32,696 --> 00:10:34,365
Hey guys, sorry I'm late.
Rachel, hey.

162
00:10:34,398 --> 00:10:35,967
It happens, you know?

163
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:40,004
Are you okay?
Is something wrong?

164
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,877
What's wrong is that Sherry's
aways opening up on her own.

165
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:50,848
Even with a full staff because Princess
Rachel is so freaking delicate.

166
00:10:50,882 --> 00:10:53,184
Castles Deli.
We cater.

167
00:10:57,455 --> 00:11:00,892
Yeah, so he almost blurted it
out right in front of my mom.

168
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:02,460
As if it's not embarrassing
enough.

169
00:11:02,493 --> 00:11:04,595
Blurt out what?

170
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,232
Really?

171
00:11:07,264 --> 00:11:10,335
You know, that thing that boyfriend
and girlfriends fight about.

172
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:11,970
What?

173
00:11:12,003 --> 00:11:12,970
Sex.

174
00:11:13,003 --> 00:11:14,306
Or not sex.

175
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:15,473
You guys never had sex?

176
00:11:15,505 --> 00:11:17,408
Ryan!

177
00:11:17,774 --> 00:11:21,612
Sorry, Troy just-he didn't seem
like the waiting type.

178
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:24,816
I told him I wasn't ready and
he didn't force it.

179
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:26,652
He's not like, an animal.

180
00:11:33,358 --> 00:11:35,827
So what do you call birds that
stick together?

181
00:11:35,859 --> 00:11:37,428
I don't know.
What?

182
00:11:37,461 --> 00:11:39,030
Vel-crows.

183
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:41,599
Get it? Vel-crows.

184
00:11:41,632 --> 00:11:44,402
Yeah. Can I get
my donuts now?

185
00:11:44,435 --> 00:11:47,806
Yeah - yeah. Sorry.
I'm sorry. Yeah.

186
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:51,008
This is it.

187
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:52,476
Bro, it's not real.

188
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:55,446
I bet you twenty bucks
it's not real. Bet.

189
00:11:55,812 --> 00:11:56,681
Three?

190
00:11:56,714 --> 00:11:58,083
She can count.

191
00:11:58,115 --> 00:11:59,750
Hey, we want Rachel's table.

192
00:11:59,783 --> 00:12:01,419
She'll be delighted.

193
00:12:01,853 --> 00:12:03,989
Wonderful.
I bet she would be.

194
00:12:07,925 --> 00:12:09,061
Thank you.

195
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:12,497
Those three charmers asked
especially for you.

196
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:13,898
I told you.
I told you.

197
00:12:14,865 --> 00:12:16,335
Boy.

198
00:12:16,933 --> 00:12:18,135
Hey guys, how are you?

199
00:12:18,168 --> 00:12:20,705
Things are actually looking up.

200
00:12:21,138 --> 00:12:24,109
Okay, do you guys know what you want? Or can
I start you off with a couple of drinks?

201
00:12:24,142 --> 00:12:26,777
You can finish me off.

202
00:12:26,811 --> 00:12:28,714
Happy ending all around.

203
00:12:31,816 --> 00:12:34,386
Alright, Listen. I don't know
what the three of you want

204
00:12:34,418 --> 00:12:37,020
but if you don't stop, you're going
to have to get the hell out.

205
00:12:37,053 --> 00:12:39,156
Confirmed sighting, Bro.

206
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:43,061
Okay, you guys are gone.
You're done.

207
00:12:43,094 --> 00:12:45,397
You're disturbing everyone.
I'm kicking you out. Go!

208
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:50,869
Okay.

209
00:12:51,436 --> 00:12:52,870
Check this out.

210
00:12:53,104 --> 00:12:54,339
Get off me. Just go!
You guys are gone! Go!

211
00:12:54,372 --> 00:12:57,109
I just want you to know who you
got working for you, alright?

212
00:12:58,475 --> 00:13:00,077
You know those guys?

213
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,479
No, I don't know them.

214
00:13:01,946 --> 00:13:03,114
They knew you.

215
00:13:04,481 --> 00:13:06,016
It's nice to see Ryan grow some
balls for once.

216
00:13:14,492 --> 00:13:17,562
Hey Ryan, thank you so much for
handling that.

217
00:13:17,595 --> 00:13:19,998
I really don't know who they are
or what they wanted.

218
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,935
Hello.

219
00:13:24,469 --> 00:13:26,104
Why are you showing me porn?

220
00:13:26,137 --> 00:13:27,571
Those guys saw your
picture on this site,

221
00:13:27,604 --> 00:13:29,072
they came here to find you.

222
00:13:29,105 --> 00:13:30,841
What? What is this?

223
00:13:30,874 --> 00:13:32,210
Some revenge porn website.

224
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:34,179
Look what it says at the bottom.

225
00:13:36,513 --> 00:13:38,182
What the hell is this?

226
00:13:38,215 --> 00:13:41,919
Rachel, I know you didn't write that, you
know. But I think we know who did it, okay?

227
00:13:42,619 --> 00:13:44,022
Rachel!

228
00:13:53,096 --> 00:13:55,032
Rachel, are you okay?

229
00:14:00,171 --> 00:14:02,040
Is there anything
I can do for you?

230
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:07,011
No.

231
00:14:07,045 --> 00:14:11,015
Thank you so much, Ryan, for telling
me. But I gotta get out of here.

232
00:14:11,047 --> 00:14:12,950
Table six wants to know where
their check is?

233
00:14:12,984 --> 00:14:14,853
Hello? I'm talking to you?

234
00:14:14,885 --> 00:14:16,587
What's her problem?

235
00:15:27,157 --> 00:15:28,659
What happened?

236
00:15:33,998 --> 00:15:35,633
Sweetie, what's going on?

237
00:15:39,135 --> 00:15:41,639
There's this website,

238
00:15:42,172 --> 00:15:45,676
where guys post pictures of
their ex-girlfriends.

239
00:15:46,277 --> 00:15:47,878
Naked pictures.

240
00:15:49,647 --> 00:15:51,181
And sometimes videos.

241
00:15:52,282 --> 00:15:54,885
What does this have to
do with you?

242
00:15:56,787 --> 00:15:58,889
I have to show you something.

243
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,671
Okay, you have got to be
kidding me, Rachel!

244
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:15,072
What? My God!

245
00:16:16,106 --> 00:16:17,942
The comments.

246
00:16:18,308 --> 00:16:20,243
This is your work address.

247
00:16:20,277 --> 00:16:21,645
I know. That's why I'm here.

248
00:16:21,678 --> 00:16:24,214
That's why I came home early,
because a bunch of them showed up.

249
00:16:24,248 --> 00:16:26,017
They came to your work?

250
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:26,883
Are you okay?

251
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:27,585
Yeah, I'm fine.
Nothing really happened.

252
00:16:27,618 --> 00:16:31,155
They just came and said stuff.

253
00:16:31,187 --> 00:16:32,188
And then Ryan kicked them out.

254
00:16:32,223 --> 00:16:35,193
And then they told told Ryan
and Ryan told me.

255
00:16:36,027 --> 00:16:37,628
It's just really sick.

256
00:16:38,195 --> 00:16:40,965
I don't understand how this
could happen.

257
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,735
Is this Troy?

258
00:16:47,071 --> 00:16:48,373
Yeah
God.

259
00:16:49,205 --> 00:16:51,142
What is this crap?

260
00:16:51,374 --> 00:16:54,678
It's some kind of stalker
website!

261
00:16:54,711 --> 00:16:56,648
That's the guy that runs it.

262
00:16:57,681 --> 00:16:59,149
He runs the website.

263
00:16:59,182 --> 00:17:01,218
A lot of bitches out there
have it coming.

264
00:17:01,252 --> 00:17:05,056
This isn't just a spank bank
fodder,

265
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:07,157
though you'll like that part
too.

266
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,360
Squirt'em
then hurt'em.

267
00:17:10,394 --> 00:17:14,332
Because real men stick together.
My God! Rachel!

268
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:16,267
Who are these people?

269
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,903
Guys that think they can
get away with it.

270
00:17:18,936 --> 00:17:20,905
Guys like Troy, I guess.

271
00:17:20,937 --> 00:17:22,806
Why did you let Troy take these
pictures?

272
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,310
Because I was stupid Mom!
I don't know! Okay?

273
00:17:26,877 --> 00:17:28,113
Rachel!

274
00:17:28,878 --> 00:17:30,180
Rachel!
What?

275
00:17:30,214 --> 00:17:34,085
I already feel so stupid. I
don't need you slut shaming me!

276
00:17:34,118 --> 00:17:35,419
Okay.
Okay.

277
00:17:35,453 --> 00:17:37,088
It's just...

278
00:17:37,754 --> 00:17:40,090
Those comments. I'm worried.

279
00:17:40,123 --> 00:17:41,291
I'm worried too.

280
00:17:42,426 --> 00:17:44,095
They drove all the way out
here to find me.

281
00:17:44,128 --> 00:17:45,696
We'll get the pictures
taken down, okay?

282
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,198
I promise.

283
00:17:48,998 --> 00:17:52,235
I write to this Ashton Banks jerk, and I'll
tell him to take down the pictures immediately.

284
00:17:52,269 --> 00:17:56,007
And if he doesn't, my lawyer friend
Carol who will be all over his ass.

285
00:17:56,273 --> 00:17:57,875
How can he say no to that?

286
00:17:57,907 --> 00:17:59,711
Game over.

287
00:18:01,212 --> 00:18:03,381
Everything's gonna be okay.

288
00:18:03,414 --> 00:18:05,282
Mom.

289
00:18:08,418 --> 00:18:11,321
Please don't tell Dad.

290
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:15,760
He already hates me.
Your father doesn't hate you.

291
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:18,329
Just, please.

292
00:18:19,796 --> 00:18:21,331
Okay.

293
00:18:21,365 --> 00:18:23,401
I guess he doesn't need to know.

294
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,839
This will all be over tomorrow.

295
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:29,306
I promise.

296
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,209
Come here.

297
00:18:34,512 --> 00:18:36,181
It's okay.

298
00:18:44,321 --> 00:18:46,124
Dear Mr. Banks,

299
00:18:46,157 --> 00:18:48,158
I was disgusted finding my
daughter Rachel's

300
00:18:48,192 --> 00:18:50,895
pictures on your website
this afternoon.

301
00:18:50,927 --> 00:18:54,931
They were posted without her
knowledge and against her will.

302
00:18:54,965 --> 00:18:59,203
This is a violation of her right and as
well as a threat of her personal safety.

303
00:18:59,235 --> 00:19:02,172
As several of your so called
gentlemen have already

304
00:19:02,205 --> 00:19:05,810
tracked her down and publicly
humiliated her.

305
00:19:15,351 --> 00:19:17,086
<i>Hey what's up? it's Troy.</i>

306
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,858
<i>I'm not here right now. Leave me a
message and I'll get back to you.</i>

307
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,796
I knew you were a liar.

308
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:29,199
But this is low. Even for you.

309
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:31,503
You disgust me, Troy.

310
00:19:34,237 --> 00:19:38,208
<i>I'm writing to let you know if you won't
take Rachel's pictures down immediately,</i>

311
00:19:38,242 --> 00:19:41,946
<i>my lawyer will issue you an
official cease and desist.</i>

312
00:19:41,978 --> 00:19:44,348
Regards, Barbara Light.

313
00:19:50,321 --> 00:19:53,190
I don't know how you people
sleep at night.

314
00:19:59,495 --> 00:20:01,032
Hey Rach?

315
00:20:19,015 --> 00:20:20,551
Hey.

316
00:20:25,923 --> 00:20:27,358
Rach?

317
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:30,428
Let's get out of here.

318
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,576
Two tickets for Social
Nightmare, please.

319
00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:47,977
Okay, so what do you feel like?

320
00:20:48,012 --> 00:20:51,648
Action hero with cute butt, saves
everyone from terrorist bomb?

321
00:20:51,682 --> 00:20:54,551
Or a comedian with a cute
butt, has a talking dog.

322
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:57,587
What about the one where moms don't
talk about butts and we get to go home?

323
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,922
Rachel, stop.

324
00:20:59,322 --> 00:21:00,925
Everything's going to be fine.

325
00:21:01,324 --> 00:21:02,592
Okay, I'm gonna pick the
movie this time.

326
00:21:02,626 --> 00:21:04,962
Okay.
Hi.

327
00:21:04,994 --> 00:21:07,264
Two for Social Nightmare,
please.

328
00:21:16,572 --> 00:21:17,374
Ready?

329
00:21:17,407 --> 00:21:18,909
Yeah.

330
00:21:20,144 --> 00:21:22,881
I'm gonna get the popcorn.
You get the seats? Great.

331
00:21:27,984 --> 00:21:29,486
Hey guys!

332
00:21:30,521 --> 00:21:32,924
How desperate.

333
00:21:56,112 --> 00:21:58,048
Hi Rachel.
How are you?

334
00:21:58,081 --> 00:22:00,051
Hi. Okay.
How are you?

335
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,551
Great.

336
00:22:02,753 --> 00:22:04,621
Now that you're here.

337
00:22:05,656 --> 00:22:07,425
Alright.

338
00:22:07,623 --> 00:22:09,526
I clicked on the link
you sent me.

339
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,994
You're a naughty girl.

340
00:22:12,262 --> 00:22:14,498
I never sent you anything.
Don't be embarrassed.

341
00:22:14,531 --> 00:22:16,267
You're a beautiful woman.

342
00:22:16,632 --> 00:22:18,669
Hey Rach...
Is something wrong?

343
00:22:27,677 --> 00:22:29,714
Mom we have to go, now.
Wait. What's going on?

344
00:22:29,746 --> 00:22:31,248
Mr. White just creeped
on me hard.

345
00:22:31,282 --> 00:22:34,484
Wait. Are you serious? Yeah. He saw
Life Ruiners. I told you. Let's go.

346
00:23:02,579 --> 00:23:05,182
Troy sent a link to
Mr. White. He had to.

347
00:23:05,215 --> 00:23:08,551
Maybe. But I saw all those girls
that I knew laughing at me in there.

348
00:23:08,584 --> 00:23:09,686
And whispering.

349
00:23:09,719 --> 00:23:11,053
Maybe they saw the website and
decided to mess with me.

350
00:23:11,088 --> 00:23:14,625
Or it could have been any of those
three guys in the restaurant.

351
00:23:14,657 --> 00:23:18,596
Or anyone who's seen the pictures,
which is everyone else in town.

352
00:23:20,063 --> 00:23:21,431
Mom!

353
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:23,567
You shouldn't have let Troy take
those pictures.

354
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,169
You should have made sure that
he deleted them.

355
00:23:26,203 --> 00:23:28,039
And now you've damaged your
reputation.

356
00:23:28,071 --> 00:23:29,239
Possibly your music career.

357
00:23:29,273 --> 00:23:31,042
And you have put yourself and me
in actual physical danger!

358
00:23:31,074 --> 00:23:35,812
Mom, there is no way that I could have possibly
know all of this was going to happen, okay?

359
00:23:35,846 --> 00:23:39,483
Troy promised me he wouldn't
eleted themright in front of me.

360
00:23:39,515 --> 00:23:41,084
Get a clue, Rachel!

361
00:23:41,118 --> 00:23:43,119
He downloaded them to his
computer first.

362
00:23:43,153 --> 00:23:45,056
Even I know that.

363
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:47,625
I cannot believe you let
him take naked pictures of you.

364
00:23:47,657 --> 00:23:51,462
In this day and age. I can't believe
you would do something so stupid.

365
00:23:51,494 --> 00:23:56,100
Well I did, okay? I did. Just like
every other girl out there since 1996.

366
00:23:56,132 --> 00:23:59,803
Like no guy has a Polaroid picture of you
with big hair, tan lines, and no shirt.

367
00:24:02,106 --> 00:24:03,041
Where are we going?

368
00:24:03,073 --> 00:24:04,608
Where we should have gone in
the first place.

369
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,475
To the police.

370
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:06,610
My God.
Yeah.

371
00:24:13,183 --> 00:24:14,651
So you willingly took
the pictures.

372
00:24:14,685 --> 00:24:18,489
He didn't threaten you, or trick you,
or take them without your knowledge?

373
00:24:18,522 --> 00:24:20,657
It's okay. You can tell her.

374
00:24:21,657 --> 00:24:23,093
Well, we took them together.

375
00:24:23,526 --> 00:24:24,828
You're an adult over eighteen?

376
00:24:24,861 --> 00:24:26,496
She's nineteen.

377
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:29,100
So what do you want me to do?

378
00:24:29,132 --> 00:24:30,400
Can't we press charges?

379
00:24:31,568 --> 00:24:33,637
You just told me that you, an
adult woman,

380
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:37,574
willingly took the pictures and
he took them on his own phone.

381
00:24:37,608 --> 00:24:40,110
That means that those pictures
are technically his property and

382
00:24:40,144 --> 00:24:42,580
he can do with them
what he wishes.

383
00:24:43,647 --> 00:24:47,518
Now that may be very well be that he's
a bad person for putting them online.

384
00:24:47,551 --> 00:24:52,122
But the last time I checked, just
being a jerk is not against the law.

385
00:24:53,557 --> 00:24:55,726
So, what do you want me to do?

386
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:58,863
Okay, but these men
have my address.

387
00:24:59,295 --> 00:25:01,565
They came to my work to find me.

388
00:25:01,764 --> 00:25:04,167
Did they touch you?

389
00:25:04,201 --> 00:25:05,269
Did they make threats?

390
00:25:05,301 --> 00:25:06,669
No but they...

391
00:25:06,704 --> 00:25:09,807
I'll put it in the record and we
will keep it on file.

392
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,643
If they do something, then we
can do something.

393
00:25:12,676 --> 00:25:13,843
But until then...

394
00:25:13,877 --> 00:25:15,412
Okay so we're just supposed to
wait until she gets hurt?

395
00:25:15,446 --> 00:25:19,683
Maybe she'll get raped or kidnapped?
And then you're going to do something?

396
00:25:19,715 --> 00:25:24,754
There is no actual evidence that an
actual person has committed an actual c

397
00:25:24,788 --> 00:25:27,558
We're not gonna waste our man
power until there is.

398
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:30,194
Because while your daughter is
out there sexting,

399
00:25:30,226 --> 00:25:31,695
and taking her shirt off,

400
00:25:31,728 --> 00:25:36,533
we are putting our lives on the line
tracking down thieves and murderers.

401
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:38,569
I'm just trying to keep my
daughter safe.

402
00:25:38,601 --> 00:25:39,802
Your daughter is an adult.

403
00:25:39,836 --> 00:25:42,273
Adults take responsibility
for their actions.

404
00:25:43,873 --> 00:25:47,144
If there's nothing further,
here's my card.

405
00:25:47,677 --> 00:25:48,946
Mom, let's just go.

406
00:25:48,978 --> 00:25:51,848
This is what I pay taxes for?

407
00:25:51,881 --> 00:25:52,749
Mom, come on.

408
00:25:52,782 --> 00:25:53,917
You just forget.

409
00:25:54,685 --> 00:25:55,886
A waste of time.

410
00:26:33,623 --> 00:26:34,725
Can you believe that?

411
00:26:34,757 --> 00:26:35,892
What a nightmare.

412
00:26:35,926 --> 00:26:37,794
You agreed with her.
You said it earlier.

413
00:26:37,828 --> 00:26:40,364
Yes. No.
It doesn't matter.

414
00:26:40,397 --> 00:26:42,366
I just want the cops
to do their job.

415
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:43,734
Okay, well where are
we going now?

416
00:26:43,766 --> 00:26:47,638
Well they said that Troy owned the
picture. So he can take it down.

417
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,907
He won't talk to me.
Well he's going to have to.

418
00:26:49,939 --> 00:26:51,808
Because that's where
we're going.

419
00:26:52,642 --> 00:26:53,944
And then we'll...

420
00:26:56,746 --> 00:26:59,649
Then we're gonna talk to Carol and
see if we can file a civil suit.

421
00:27:04,855 --> 00:27:06,791
What are you looking at?

422
00:27:12,428 --> 00:27:13,363
Mom, what are you doing?

423
00:27:13,397 --> 00:27:16,300
There's a van following
us. Hang on!

424
00:27:17,466 --> 00:27:18,936
Are you sure?

425
00:27:26,943 --> 00:27:28,878
Mom! What was that?

426
00:27:44,093 --> 00:27:44,994
Mom, what are we doing?

427
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:46,664
Watch.

428
00:28:03,013 --> 00:28:04,982
He doesn't have a license plate.
I'm calling 9-1-1.

429
00:28:05,014 --> 00:28:07,350
-Screw that!
-Mom!

430
00:28:10,353 --> 00:28:11,087
Mom, what are you doing?

431
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,857
Stay in the car!

432
00:28:14,991 --> 00:28:17,762
Okay, psycho, I know you're
following us.

433
00:28:17,994 --> 00:28:19,929
Mom!
Stay in the car!

434
00:28:19,963 --> 00:28:21,365
Get in the car!

435
00:28:24,868 --> 00:28:27,071
I'm not scared of you!
Mom! What are you doing?

436
00:28:27,103 --> 00:28:28,805
Leave my daughter alone!

437
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:51,127
Are you serious?!

438
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,430
You yell at me for not being responsible?
You just almost got yourself ran over.

439
00:28:54,464 --> 00:28:56,367
Rachel, I know what I'm doing.

440
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,034
Okay. Can you see
anything in the picture?

441
00:28:58,068 --> 00:29:01,538
No! You can't see anyone's face. But
I'm emailing it to Officer Sampson.

442
00:29:01,571 --> 00:29:04,675
Okay, fine. But we're
basically on our own.

443
00:29:08,811 --> 00:29:10,447
We're going to Troy's.

444
00:29:19,923 --> 00:29:21,859
Okay, you have to be nice.

445
00:29:21,891 --> 00:29:24,394
I do too. We both do.
If we want him on our side.

446
00:29:24,427 --> 00:29:26,097
Alright. I can do that.

447
00:29:26,495 --> 00:29:28,165
I think.
Try hard.

448
00:29:32,569 --> 00:29:33,537
Hello?

449
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,571
Hey Dineen, it's Rachel.

450
00:29:35,605 --> 00:29:37,808
I'm sorry, I know it's
really late.

451
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,444
Do you think you can buzz me in?
I have to talk to Troy.

452
00:29:40,476 --> 00:29:41,844
Does she even know
you guys are broken up?

453
00:29:41,878 --> 00:29:44,181
I don't know. Sorry, Rachel,
but Troy's not here.

454
00:29:44,214 --> 00:29:45,816
You'll have
to try his phone.

455
00:29:45,849 --> 00:29:48,952
I did. He's not answering me.

456
00:29:48,984 --> 00:29:52,523
Sorry, we kind of got into a
fight and I have to apologize.

457
00:29:52,555 --> 00:29:54,891
Can I just come in and
wait for him?

458
00:29:57,593 --> 00:30:02,866
I'm sorry Rachel but Troy's left
for school for the semester.

459
00:30:04,134 --> 00:30:06,170
But I really have to
talk to him.

460
00:30:06,837 --> 00:30:08,472
I don't know what
to tell you.

461
00:30:13,042 --> 00:30:14,945
What is that all about?

462
00:30:16,045 --> 00:30:17,782
Thirsty bitch.

463
00:30:19,248 --> 00:30:20,850
Jesus.

464
00:30:22,785 --> 00:30:26,423
Alright. We'll come back tomorrow, 'cause
there is no way that he left for school yet.

465
00:30:53,015 --> 00:30:55,619
It's okay. We're safe.
We're home.

466
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,193
Wha-What the hell have
you two been doing?

467
00:31:03,225 --> 00:31:05,027
What the hell are you
doing in my house?

468
00:31:05,061 --> 00:31:07,930
This is my house.
I pay for it.

469
00:31:07,964 --> 00:31:09,265
And I wanna know what
this filth is.

470
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:11,068
And why it was sent to
my work email.

471
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,503
Dad, no.

472
00:31:13,536 --> 00:31:15,972
At my work, this is the sort of
thing that gets men fired.

473
00:31:16,005 --> 00:31:17,140
I just-I...

474
00:31:17,706 --> 00:31:19,075
I don't understand.

475
00:31:20,342 --> 00:31:23,045
Rachel. You always know what
to say to make things worse.

476
00:31:31,321 --> 00:31:33,557
Can I talk to you
outside, please?

477
00:31:33,924 --> 00:31:35,259
Close the door.

478
00:31:38,028 --> 00:31:40,264
I blame you for this.
Of course you do.

479
00:31:40,296 --> 00:31:43,165
Because I'm such an awful person. It's
my fault that you were never around.

480
00:31:43,198 --> 00:31:47,704
And that I had to do everything myself. And
I also invented the internet and sexting.

481
00:31:47,736 --> 00:31:50,106
I'm like the Al Gore
of bad moms.

482
00:32:01,016 --> 00:32:03,052
This isn't about jokes, Barbara.

483
00:32:03,086 --> 00:32:05,188
This is about your failure to
raise our daughter.

484
00:32:05,221 --> 00:32:08,692
Your the expert at not
raising her.

485
00:32:08,725 --> 00:32:10,994
She's naked on the internet.

486
00:32:17,266 --> 00:32:21,203
So maybe if you were around, she
won't be prancing around with Troy.

487
00:32:21,236 --> 00:32:22,238
You blame me for this?

488
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,041
Absolutely.

489
00:32:25,774 --> 00:32:28,144
Your never here. You
were never around.

490
00:32:28,177 --> 00:32:30,112
Same old story.
That's why our marriage ended.

491
00:32:30,146 --> 00:32:31,148
God.

492
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,696
Rachel!

493
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:50,633
Rachel, Stop!

494
00:32:50,634 --> 00:32:52,970
Stop.

495
00:33:06,081 --> 00:33:07,650
It's going to be okay.

496
00:33:09,653 --> 00:33:11,922
Please.

497
00:33:28,737 --> 00:33:30,105
Everybody knows.

498
00:33:32,074 --> 00:33:34,343
This is exactly what Troy wanted
when he posted the pictures online.

499
00:33:34,377 --> 00:33:35,744
For you to feel
ashamed and paranoid.

500
00:33:35,779 --> 00:33:40,083
And the perverts with the comments
and that stalker in the van.

501
00:33:40,116 --> 00:33:42,019
They want you to be
scared, Rachel.

502
00:33:42,051 --> 00:33:44,120
Don't let them win.

503
00:33:44,753 --> 00:33:47,057
Okay.
Okay.

504
00:33:54,097 --> 00:33:56,166
She's looking at
me really funny.

505
00:33:56,198 --> 00:33:57,100
Mrs. Zoe?
Yeah.

506
00:33:57,134 --> 00:34:00,270
She went senile a
long time ago. Come on.

507
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:36,139
Can we sit here?

508
00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:40,811
You may all be seated.

509
00:34:44,313 --> 00:34:45,449
Good morning!

510
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:49,420
Excuse me.
Excuse me, that's my purse.

511
00:34:49,886 --> 00:34:51,321
Okay.

512
00:34:51,353 --> 00:34:53,022
Well we need
to sit down.

513
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,558
Hey Rachel!

514
00:34:55,592 --> 00:34:58,362
Excuse me, this is my space. You
know what? We need to sit down.

515
00:34:59,362 --> 00:35:01,764
Mom, Ryan's over there.

516
00:35:02,431 --> 00:35:03,933
<i>As well as any guests that may
be here today.</i>

517
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:07,037
<i>Now for some brief announcements.
Adult play rehearsal,</i>

518
00:35:07,069 --> 00:35:08,638
<i>they have been moved from
Tuesdays to Wednesdays at 7pm.</i>

519
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:13,342
<i>We always have a need for all voice
parts. So please come join us.</i>

520
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:15,178
No auditions necessary.

521
00:35:15,377 --> 00:35:19,248
And without further ado,
Father Renly.

522
00:35:21,918 --> 00:35:23,186
Thank you, Paula.

523
00:35:23,953 --> 00:35:25,288
I'd like to take a survey.

524
00:35:26,489 --> 00:35:28,925
Just raise your hands and
try to be honest.

525
00:35:28,958 --> 00:35:32,196
Remember, you cannot lie to him.

526
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:40,170
Now, how many of you have ever
lost your temper?

527
00:35:41,804 --> 00:35:43,239
Or over eaten?

528
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:52,282
Or felt really jealous because
your neighbor got that new

529
00:35:52,315 --> 00:35:55,519
iWatch phone you've
been looking at?

530
00:35:56,819 --> 00:35:59,088
See, that wasn't so bad.

531
00:36:00,355 --> 00:36:05,494
It's not that hard for us to
admit to sins like,

532
00:36:05,527 --> 00:36:09,799
anger, gluttony and envy.

533
00:36:10,833 --> 00:36:12,868
But I wonder,

534
00:36:12,902 --> 00:36:19,376
How many of you would admit to
lust? It's a tricky subject.

535
00:36:19,842 --> 00:36:24,248
Something we don't really want
to discuss.

536
00:36:24,848 --> 00:36:26,583
But we must.

537
00:36:26,616 --> 00:36:30,420
Because lust is among us.

538
00:36:31,321 --> 00:36:33,790
It's on the media we consume.

539
00:36:34,456 --> 00:36:37,293
The clothes we wear.

540
00:36:37,326 --> 00:36:41,799
And it can very well be here,
among us today.

541
00:36:41,998 --> 00:36:45,402
We are afraid to talk
about the sin of lust.

542
00:36:46,034 --> 00:36:48,504
Suzie, my God, why
did she come?

543
00:36:48,538 --> 00:36:51,373
It's called being
desperate. Church and chill.

544
00:36:53,409 --> 00:36:55,546
My god.

545
00:36:56,411 --> 00:36:57,913
in the world.

546
00:36:57,947 --> 00:37:05,956
The lust of the flesh. The lust of
the eyes and the pride of life.

547
00:37:06,656 --> 00:37:11,228
Come not from our father but
from the world.

548
00:37:12,395 --> 00:37:18,268
The only way to be rid of lust,
is to cut it off completely.

549
00:37:18,634 --> 00:37:23,272
It is better for you to lose
one part of your body,

550
00:37:23,306 --> 00:37:27,277
then for your whole body to be
thrown into Hell.

551
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:33,516
Well, that was interesting.
Yeah, I'll say.

552
00:37:35,018 --> 00:37:37,020
I'm going to get
some donuts.

553
00:37:37,052 --> 00:37:38,554
I'm gonna go with him.

554
00:37:41,357 --> 00:37:43,192
Little Rachel Light.

555
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:45,394
Not so little anymore.

556
00:37:45,427 --> 00:37:47,297
Mrs. Zoe.
Good morning.

557
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:49,465
Let me give you some advice,

558
00:37:49,498 --> 00:37:54,503
Church is not the place for
distractions.

559
00:37:54,536 --> 00:37:55,605
Okay?

560
00:37:55,638 --> 00:37:58,442
Your buttons. They're
coming undone.

561
00:37:59,007 --> 00:38:01,511
Don't mean to meddle.

562
00:38:01,543 --> 00:38:04,348
But modesty, it is a virtue.

563
00:38:04,947 --> 00:38:06,482
What did you say to my daughter?

564
00:38:07,917 --> 00:38:12,956
Just that I thought Father Renly
made quite a few pertinent points.

565
00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:16,659
Really? 'Cause I thought he sounded
like a sanctimonious wind bag.

566
00:38:16,692 --> 00:38:19,461
This is a house of
worship and love.

567
00:38:19,494 --> 00:38:21,230
Please behave like it.

568
00:38:21,464 --> 00:38:24,467
You need to humble yourself,
Barbara Light.

569
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,036
You and your daughter.

570
00:38:27,703 --> 00:38:30,006
You need to get right with God.
Okay.

571
00:38:33,009 --> 00:38:33,976
Well.

572
00:38:34,444 --> 00:38:36,045
Never.

573
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,415
Rachel. Wait.

574
00:38:39,449 --> 00:38:42,185
I told you everyone knows.
I think you're wrong.

575
00:38:42,217 --> 00:38:43,685
Of course you do.

576
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:46,689
Okay, so what did Troy tell you about
putting you on the revenge porn site?

577
00:38:46,723 --> 00:38:48,391
Nothing. He won't answer me.

578
00:38:48,424 --> 00:38:50,393
He's not even in town anymore.

579
00:38:50,426 --> 00:38:51,594
Yes he is.

580
00:38:51,627 --> 00:38:52,795
Yeah, he came to the restaurant
last night with some girl.

581
00:38:52,828 --> 00:38:56,632
He did? Yeah. It's probably
just to make you jealous.

582
00:38:56,665 --> 00:38:58,334
I have to go talk to him!
It doesn't matter.

583
00:38:58,368 --> 00:39:02,572
I have an appointment with Carol later today.
She specializes in intellectual property.

584
00:39:02,605 --> 00:39:04,942
She has to know something about
revenge porn.

585
00:39:05,741 --> 00:39:07,710
He deserves to be told
off, at least.

586
00:39:08,243 --> 00:39:11,380
I don't think it's a good idea. What
if he's the one that was following us?

587
00:39:11,413 --> 00:39:13,316
Trust me. He's not.

588
00:39:15,183 --> 00:39:19,621
Don't worry Mrs. Light. I'll go with
her. I'll make sure she's safe, okay?

589
00:39:19,654 --> 00:39:21,324
Okay.

590
00:39:30,565 --> 00:39:33,602
Two years ago, no one knew
what revenge porn was.

591
00:39:33,636 --> 00:39:35,471
Now it's everywhere.

592
00:39:35,505 --> 00:39:39,042
They're finally passing laws but
it is a slow process.

593
00:39:39,074 --> 00:39:41,543
There is no law against
it in our state.

594
00:39:41,576 --> 00:39:42,544
Not yet.

595
00:39:42,578 --> 00:39:45,281
Takes a while to challenge the
first amendment.

596
00:39:45,313 --> 00:39:46,482
But I don't get it.

597
00:39:47,315 --> 00:39:48,484
I mean, it's just topless
photos.

598
00:39:49,918 --> 00:39:52,455
It hasn't been shocking since
we were Rachel's age.

599
00:39:52,487 --> 00:39:53,690
It's not like it's a sex tape.

600
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:57,994
Why are these guys so
worked up about it?

601
00:39:59,061 --> 00:40:02,431
It's not about the pictures.
This is something new.

602
00:40:02,665 --> 00:40:05,567
This is angry people that want
to do bad things to women.

603
00:40:05,601 --> 00:40:10,340
And they're using the pretense of making
women pay for daring to hurt their bros.

604
00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:12,508
So what do I do?

605
00:40:14,076 --> 00:40:17,714
I gotta tell you, it is almost
impossible to get pictures

606
00:40:17,746 --> 00:40:19,750
completely off the internet
once they go up.

607
00:40:20,583 --> 00:40:22,585
I mean, but there are
some things you can do.

608
00:40:22,618 --> 00:40:25,221
First, contact all the
major search engines and ask

609
00:40:25,253 --> 00:40:27,757
them to remove the links of the
pictures from their searches.

610
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:30,759
It's not going to take the pictures
from the revenge porn site,

611
00:40:30,793 --> 00:40:34,064
But it will make it a lot harder
for them to find.

612
00:40:34,096 --> 00:40:35,799
And then you need to do your
research.

613
00:40:35,831 --> 00:40:38,467
Find out what company
hosts this site.

614
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,569
Report what the site's
been doing.

615
00:40:40,603 --> 00:40:43,507
I bet you those companies would
start advocating on your behalf.

616
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:46,743
Yeah but even if I do all that,
it's not guaranteed to work.

617
00:40:46,775 --> 00:40:47,810
No.

618
00:40:48,944 --> 00:40:51,514
So you're also going to come to
my office on Monday,

619
00:40:51,714 --> 00:40:54,116
So we can talk about a
strategy together.

620
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,285
Okay.
Because Barbara,

621
00:40:55,317 --> 00:40:59,188
this Ashton Banks clown will
never stop.

622
00:40:59,788 --> 00:41:01,623
The more drama, the better for
his business.

623
00:41:01,656 --> 00:41:02,991
So you don't stop.

624
00:41:03,025 --> 00:41:06,128
You threaten him with lawsuits,
you harass him via his own media,

625
00:41:06,161 --> 00:41:08,165
and you scare the crap
out of him.

626
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:11,133
Use his own tactics against him.

627
00:41:11,734 --> 00:41:15,471
Because these guys, they think
they're rock stars.

628
00:41:16,205 --> 00:41:21,110
But in the end, they're just sad
little boys.

629
00:41:21,143 --> 00:41:22,111
Cheers to that.

630
00:41:39,161 --> 00:41:40,429
You know...

631
00:41:41,596 --> 00:41:42,631
Castle's never been the same
without you.

632
00:41:42,665 --> 00:41:43,866
I mean, Sherry only pretends to
laugh at my jokes.

633
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,670
I mean, Ryan, everyone kinda
pretends to laugh at your jokes.

634
00:41:47,703 --> 00:41:49,672
Okay, I know that's a lie
because the ladies at

635
00:41:49,705 --> 00:41:52,875
the nursing home think I'm
very funny. I'm just kidding.

636
00:42:13,628 --> 00:42:14,864
I knew it.

637
00:42:15,598 --> 00:42:16,733
I knew you'd be back for more.

638
00:42:16,766 --> 00:42:18,601
So much for being at school.

639
00:42:18,868 --> 00:42:20,069
What's your problem, man?

640
00:42:20,103 --> 00:42:22,705
You put her pictures on the
internet for everyone to see.

641
00:42:22,737 --> 00:42:24,239
It's ruining her life.

642
00:42:24,272 --> 00:42:27,709
So a girl breaks up with you. So you
can't take it, so you shame her online?

643
00:42:27,743 --> 00:42:29,746
You're a piece of crap, man!

644
00:42:29,779 --> 00:42:31,781
Are you done?
Yeah.

645
00:42:31,813 --> 00:42:33,315
Good.

646
00:42:33,348 --> 00:42:35,217
Because I didn't do it.

647
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:36,752
That's BS.

648
00:42:36,786 --> 00:42:40,190
I put the pictures on the computer,
but I didn't share them with anybody.

649
00:42:40,223 --> 00:42:41,858
Yeah, I don't believe you.

650
00:42:41,891 --> 00:42:43,126
I'm sorry, who are you again?

651
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:46,362
Troy! Why don't you just man
up and admit what you did.

652
00:42:46,395 --> 00:42:48,898
Troy let him go! Let him go!
Please!

653
00:42:49,665 --> 00:42:51,567
Come on! Haven't you done
enough?

654
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,435
Are you okay?
I'm fine.

655
00:42:53,469 --> 00:42:54,404
So what are you going to do,
Troy?

656
00:42:54,436 --> 00:42:56,639
What are you going to do
about the pictures?

657
00:42:56,871 --> 00:42:58,241
It's not my girl.

658
00:42:58,708 --> 00:43:00,310
It's not my problem.

659
00:43:04,179 --> 00:43:07,616
I'm not gonna let him hurt you
anymore. Not him. Not anyone.

660
00:43:21,663 --> 00:43:22,898
Ryan?

661
00:43:22,931 --> 00:43:25,668
Are you still here?

662
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:40,949
There's one song that I always fall
asleep to if I can't fall asleep.

663
00:43:40,982 --> 00:43:43,285
It has no words but it's really really
pretty and it's all like, piano.

664
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:48,657
So it's fake. Classical. I have
to show you this, hold on.

665
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:51,261
Okay.
It has...

666
00:43:51,293 --> 00:43:52,828
It's in here somewhere,
hold on.

667
00:43:54,462 --> 00:43:56,131
It's one of those songs, like, that they
take one song and then another song.

668
00:43:56,165 --> 00:44:00,936
They take the two songs and make it one. But
then it's like only the lyrics from one song

669
00:44:00,969 --> 00:44:03,906
and then the actual music
from the othe.

670
00:44:03,938 --> 00:44:06,743
But it just so happens that they
go really well together.

671
00:44:11,746 --> 00:44:13,984
If you look at this on your phone,
I promise I'm not making this up.

672
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,389
Hang on.

673
00:44:23,993 --> 00:44:25,295
-What was it?
-Nothing.

674
00:44:25,328 --> 00:44:26,996
The picture frame fell.

675
00:44:36,471 --> 00:44:38,507
My lady.
Thank you.

676
00:44:42,478 --> 00:44:44,347
You like me, right?

677
00:44:44,779 --> 00:44:47,482
I mean, you know I do.

678
00:44:47,516 --> 00:44:49,052
No but I mean you like me.

679
00:44:49,851 --> 00:44:53,790
Not like the victim that needs a
big strong hero.

680
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:57,960
But I'm serious. You're not
going to leave when I'm strong

681
00:44:57,993 --> 00:45:00,862
enough to have like, a
personality again, right?

682
00:45:00,895 --> 00:45:02,798
You have a personality?

683
00:45:04,766 --> 00:45:07,469
Ouch! Ouch! Geez!

684
00:45:07,502 --> 00:45:09,838
I contacted several women from
the sites,

685
00:45:09,871 --> 00:45:13,042
none of those women I spoke to
voluntarily submitted these photos.

686
00:45:13,074 --> 00:45:15,977
One of them had their photo
stolen from the doctor's office.

687
00:45:16,011 --> 00:45:18,781
Really? Yeah, they were taken during
her treatment for breast cancer.

688
00:45:18,813 --> 00:45:23,051
My god! And get this. They all told
me they were interviewed by the FBI.

689
00:45:23,085 --> 00:45:24,686
So what does that mean?

690
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:27,889
It means, I think they already have a
file on this guy who's running the site.

691
00:45:27,922 --> 00:45:30,959
They're just waiting for
the right evidence to nab him.

692
00:45:30,993 --> 00:45:32,929
But I thought he wasn't breaking
any laws?

693
00:45:32,962 --> 00:45:34,297
Not any state laws.

694
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:38,067
But if he's hacking into private
hard drives to get this material,

695
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,634
that's a federal offense.

696
00:45:39,668 --> 00:45:43,539
I guarantee you they are waiting for
proof to pounce on this dirt bag.

697
00:45:43,572 --> 00:45:45,675
Yeah.

698
00:45:45,907 --> 00:45:48,411
Speaking of, you know what,
Carol, I need to go.

699
00:45:48,444 --> 00:45:50,079
But thank you so much for all
your help.

700
00:45:50,112 --> 00:45:52,048
Are you kidding? Of course.

701
00:45:52,081 --> 00:45:55,785
Plus I would love to see this
guy get what he deserves.

702
00:45:55,817 --> 00:45:56,886
Yeah, me too.

703
00:45:56,918 --> 00:45:57,819
See you later.

704
00:46:00,221 --> 00:46:02,958
Stop it. Stop it. Stop.

705
00:46:02,991 --> 00:46:04,993
Geez! You two were up
there for a while.

706
00:46:05,027 --> 00:46:06,429
We were just talking.

707
00:46:07,696 --> 00:46:10,465
Yeah. Rachel has very
interesting, musical influences.

708
00:46:10,498 --> 00:46:12,534
And thank you for
writing those emails.

709
00:46:12,567 --> 00:46:16,872
One to Google, one to the hosting
site, and one to Life Ruiners.

710
00:46:16,906 --> 00:46:19,041
Do you think it'll do any good?

711
00:46:19,074 --> 00:46:22,746
Well, I already got a response
from Ashton Banks.

712
00:46:22,978 --> 00:46:24,914
The guy that runs the
revenge porn site?

713
00:46:24,947 --> 00:46:27,417
-Yep.
-What did he say?

714
00:46:29,585 --> 00:46:32,021
My God! Looks like a turtle!
What is it?

715
00:46:32,054 --> 00:46:33,423
It's a dick pic.

716
00:46:34,523 --> 00:46:36,491
You can see the level of idiocy
we're dealing with.

717
00:46:36,525 --> 00:46:38,161
This guy.

718
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,428
Thinks he can do what ever he
wants!

719
00:46:40,462 --> 00:46:43,098
He thinks he can publish whatever and
tries to scare us with his minions.

720
00:46:43,132 --> 00:46:46,101
He thinks he's above the law and
no one can touch him!

721
00:46:46,134 --> 00:46:47,502
Pretty much.
Wait! What about this?

722
00:46:47,536 --> 00:46:50,872
They're advertising charging people
for taking their pictures down.

723
00:46:50,906 --> 00:46:52,442
So what if we just pay the fee?

724
00:46:52,475 --> 00:46:53,875
No. Carol says that's a scam.

725
00:46:53,909 --> 00:46:55,478
It's probably Ashton himself.

726
00:46:57,612 --> 00:46:58,982
I don't know.

727
00:47:02,551 --> 00:47:03,453
You know...

728
00:47:03,485 --> 00:47:06,054
Rachel's going through a lot.

729
00:47:06,087 --> 00:47:07,556
I know.

730
00:47:08,857 --> 00:47:11,159
I should have taken care of this
with Troy

731
00:47:11,192 --> 00:47:14,196
sooner before he
took the pictures.

732
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:17,567
Next time, I won't be so nice.

733
00:47:28,543 --> 00:47:30,112
Pic Busters. You
need help?

734
00:47:30,145 --> 00:47:34,082
Please let us know the website, your name,
and have a valid credit card ready.

735
00:47:34,116 --> 00:47:37,018
-Is this Ashton?
-We just need your name.

736
00:47:37,052 --> 00:47:40,022
I need to speak to Ashton Banks.

737
00:47:46,694 --> 00:47:48,263
Pic Busters. You
need help?

738
00:47:48,297 --> 00:47:52,201
Please let us know the website, your name,
and have a valid credit card ready.

739
00:47:52,234 --> 00:47:53,335
I know you work for
Ashton Banks.

740
00:47:53,368 --> 00:47:56,638
And I need you to take my
pictures down immediately.

741
00:47:56,672 --> 00:47:59,175
And I need you to tell his
followers to leave me alone.

742
00:47:59,208 --> 00:48:03,079
You can have any picture taken
down immediately for $2,000.

743
00:48:03,112 --> 00:48:05,514
No! You need to take my picture
down now for free!

744
00:48:05,547 --> 00:48:08,216
Or my mom and I will ruin Ashton's
life! How about that? Rachel!

745
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:09,886
What are you doing?!

746
00:48:09,918 --> 00:48:11,052
Which one are you?

747
00:48:11,085 --> 00:48:12,254
My name is Rachel Light.

748
00:48:12,288 --> 00:48:14,223
You'll see the results
immediately.

749
00:48:14,255 --> 00:48:16,958
What did you do?

750
00:48:16,991 --> 00:48:18,227
Give me my phone.

751
00:48:19,462 --> 00:48:21,531
I really thought it would help.
I just trying to scare them.

752
00:48:34,743 --> 00:48:35,811
Hello?

753
00:48:35,844 --> 00:48:37,079
You need to learn to
keep your mouth shut.

754
00:48:37,112 --> 00:48:41,651
I've got something
you can shut it on.

755
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:44,253
What? What did he say?

756
00:48:47,056 --> 00:48:48,858
It doesn't matter.

757
00:48:52,694 --> 00:48:54,029
Hey.

758
00:48:55,663 --> 00:48:57,667
Don't worry about it.

759
00:48:58,032 --> 00:48:59,301
You didn't know.

760
00:49:00,768 --> 00:49:02,871
I have to use the restroom.

761
00:49:59,828 --> 00:50:01,096
Mom?

762
00:50:02,665 --> 00:50:04,199
Ryan?

763
00:50:38,467 --> 00:50:40,369
Something's wrong.

764
00:51:03,491 --> 00:51:06,094
Mom! Help!

765
00:51:06,127 --> 00:51:08,363
-Rachel!
-Mom!

766
00:51:10,732 --> 00:51:11,734
Hey!

767
00:51:32,453 --> 00:51:33,855
Who are you?!

768
00:51:33,889 --> 00:51:35,291
What are you doing in my house?!

769
00:51:35,324 --> 00:51:36,759
Someone took the red
pill of truth.

770
00:51:36,792 --> 00:51:42,165
A true gentlemen perceives bitches
like you for what you really are.

771
00:51:54,743 --> 00:51:56,212
<i>You have the right to
remain silent.</i>

772
00:51:56,244 --> 00:52:00,281
<i>Anything you say can and will be used
against you in the court of law.</i>

773
00:52:00,315 --> 00:52:01,683
<i>You have the right to an
attorney.</i>

774
00:52:01,717 --> 00:52:04,119
<i>If you cannot afford one, one
will be provided for you.</i>

775
00:52:18,333 --> 00:52:20,436
-I'm here.
-Mom, I'm scared.

776
00:52:20,469 --> 00:52:21,404
I know, honey. It's okay.

777
00:52:21,436 --> 00:52:24,172
We're on our way to
the hospital. I'm here.

778
00:52:24,206 --> 00:52:25,307
Mom, it hurts.

779
00:52:25,339 --> 00:52:26,274
I know, honey.

780
00:52:26,308 --> 00:52:28,444
Can't you give her something
for the pain?

781
00:52:28,476 --> 00:52:30,513
Just hang in there. We're
almost there.

782
00:52:31,346 --> 00:52:32,481
I can't believe this happened.

783
00:52:32,514 --> 00:52:34,784
I can't see anything.

784
00:52:34,817 --> 00:52:36,485
Hang in.

785
00:52:38,186 --> 00:52:40,223
It's okay, baby.

786
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,395
We're going to have a
guard here 24/7.

787
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:49,865
So I need the nurses alerted that
nobody is to visit without the parents.

788
00:52:49,897 --> 00:52:51,833
Okay. I can handle that...

789
00:52:53,835 --> 00:52:54,904
Where's my daughter?

790
00:52:55,237 --> 00:52:56,906
My daughter, Rachel Light?

791
00:52:56,938 --> 00:52:59,007
Wait a minute, you need
to show some ID.

792
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,308
Excuse me?

793
00:53:00,509 --> 00:53:01,811
That's her father.

794
00:53:01,844 --> 00:53:03,446
It's okay.

795
00:53:04,279 --> 00:53:05,481
Thanks.

796
00:53:13,455 --> 00:53:15,491
My god! Rachel.

797
00:53:16,357 --> 00:53:16,991
Daddy?

798
00:53:17,025 --> 00:53:18,461
My little girl.

799
00:53:20,094 --> 00:53:22,430
It's okay. It's not as bad
as it looks. No, no, no.

800
00:53:22,464 --> 00:53:23,699
It's okay. It's okay.

801
00:53:23,732 --> 00:53:26,335
The bandages are just there to
keep it from getting infected.

802
00:53:26,534 --> 00:53:28,270
Thank god.

803
00:53:32,406 --> 00:53:34,242
Rachel, I know I haven't
been around enough.

804
00:53:34,275 --> 00:53:36,846
I...
No, it's okay. It's okay.

805
00:53:36,878 --> 00:53:38,915
I love you, Dad.

806
00:53:40,281 --> 00:53:41,817
I love you, baby.

807
00:53:43,886 --> 00:53:45,888
I don't want you to get hurt.

808
00:54:08,342 --> 00:54:09,978
Good night.

809
00:54:34,469 --> 00:54:35,436
Are you okay?

810
00:54:35,469 --> 00:54:36,938
Yeah.

811
00:54:36,971 --> 00:54:39,574
I'm feeling a lot better.

812
00:54:45,313 --> 00:54:45,982
Mom.

813
00:54:46,014 --> 00:54:47,884
I think you should go to work.

814
00:54:48,083 --> 00:54:49,184
What? No. I'm not
going to work.

815
00:54:49,217 --> 00:54:52,321
I'm serious. I'm just going to
be laying here all day.

816
00:54:52,353 --> 00:54:54,022
There's a guard right there.

817
00:54:57,625 --> 00:55:00,328
Plus, Ryan is coming later to
keep me company.

818
00:55:01,395 --> 00:55:02,531
I know,

819
00:55:03,098 --> 00:55:05,067
You think that I'm vulnerable.

820
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,168
And Ryan is taking advantage.

821
00:55:06,201 --> 00:55:10,539
But, he's the only real friend
that's had my back.

822
00:55:11,639 --> 00:55:13,375
Are you sure you're okay?

823
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:14,610
I'm positive.

824
00:55:15,743 --> 00:55:18,947
I'll feel better that you're not
sitting here all day.

825
00:55:19,413 --> 00:55:21,950
My phone will be on all day.
If you need anything, call me.

826
00:55:21,984 --> 00:55:23,319
I'll come right back.

827
00:55:23,351 --> 00:55:24,654
Okay.

828
00:55:25,753 --> 00:55:26,654
Give me a hug.

829
00:55:26,688 --> 00:55:28,657
I love you.
I love you.

830
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:29,991
Get some rest.

831
00:55:30,025 --> 00:55:31,594
Okay.

832
00:55:52,014 --> 00:55:56,419
Okay guys, it's time for quiet
reading time. Take out your books.

833
00:56:24,712 --> 00:56:25,747
Yeah?

834
00:56:25,781 --> 00:56:28,016
What does this word mean?

835
00:56:28,049 --> 00:56:31,586
It means to get back at someone.

836
00:56:34,188 --> 00:56:36,324
Okay.

837
00:56:37,426 --> 00:56:38,627
Barbara.

838
00:56:39,194 --> 00:56:40,696
I need to talk to you.

839
00:56:40,728 --> 00:56:42,063
Okay.

840
00:56:42,096 --> 00:56:44,565
Guys, finish up with your reading
lesson. I'll be right back.

841
00:56:44,598 --> 00:56:46,468
Okay.

842
00:56:53,607 --> 00:56:55,076
What's up?

843
00:56:56,478 --> 00:56:59,148
We've been getting a lot of
phone calls and frankly a lot of

844
00:56:59,181 --> 00:57:01,717
irate emails from
school board members.

845
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:04,085
It's all about some porn
website.

846
00:57:04,118 --> 00:57:05,186
Yes, I know all about it.

847
00:57:05,219 --> 00:57:07,089
I'm sorry. I should
have told you.

848
00:57:07,121 --> 00:57:08,424
You know?
Yes.

849
00:57:08,456 --> 00:57:11,826
Well then Barbara, you may realize
the some of the conservative

850
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:14,830
school board room members
might take issue with it.

851
00:57:14,862 --> 00:57:16,565
We're working on
getting it down.

852
00:57:16,598 --> 00:57:18,667
Good. I mean I'm glad.

853
00:57:18,699 --> 00:57:23,772
I mean, obviously it's fake and
obviously it's some sort of prank.

854
00:57:23,804 --> 00:57:26,607
And I think that the reaction to
it it's extreme.

855
00:57:26,641 --> 00:57:29,677
But the superintendent is
adamant.

856
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:31,045
About what?

857
00:57:31,078 --> 00:57:34,749
We're placing you on administrative
leave, effective immediately.

858
00:57:34,782 --> 00:57:39,121
What? But this website situation has
nothing to do with my teaching.

859
00:57:39,154 --> 00:57:41,824
I know. I think this whole thing
is ridiculous.

860
00:57:41,857 --> 00:57:46,527
And I made my opinion very loudly
known. But Barbara, my hands are tied.

861
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:47,763
There's nothing that I can do.

862
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:51,433
I'm so sorry but Barbara,
you got to go.

863
00:57:53,668 --> 00:57:56,505
After this period I'll get my
stuff and...

864
00:57:56,538 --> 00:58:00,810
No. I'll take over your class.
You can go ahead and go now.

865
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:04,813
Okay.

866
00:58:17,926 --> 00:58:18,594
Hey, what are you doing here?

867
00:58:18,627 --> 00:58:20,496
I've been trying to call you.

868
00:58:20,529 --> 00:58:21,764
I got another email.

869
00:58:24,833 --> 00:58:27,802
That's not me. That isn't me.

870
00:58:27,835 --> 00:58:30,205
I know. I know. It's
just your face.

871
00:58:30,739 --> 00:58:34,810
My-That's from a family picture!
That's a family trip we took.

872
00:58:34,842 --> 00:58:36,478
Don't you remember?

873
00:58:38,246 --> 00:58:40,782
That explains why they put me on
the leave of absence.

874
00:58:40,815 --> 00:58:43,185
They must have sent it to all
the board members.

875
00:58:43,217 --> 00:58:44,853
A leave of absence?

876
00:58:45,353 --> 00:58:47,857
Good god, Barbara.
I'm so sorry.

877
00:58:48,556 --> 00:58:50,658
Where would they have gotten
this photo?

878
00:58:50,692 --> 00:58:51,527
Facebook?

879
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:52,527
Instagram?

880
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:53,528
Yes, I guess.

881
00:58:53,561 --> 00:58:56,732
Rachel probably put it up on one
of those sites.

882
00:58:59,201 --> 00:59:01,170
My god! I am trying to be
strong!

883
00:59:01,203 --> 00:59:02,603
But this is too much.

884
00:59:02,636 --> 00:59:04,572
I can't deal with this.

885
00:59:13,315 --> 00:59:15,650
I need you to show me where
this punk Troy lives.

886
00:59:15,683 --> 00:59:17,619
Okay, let's go in the morning.

887
00:59:27,795 --> 00:59:29,665
Look at this turn of events.

888
00:59:34,235 --> 00:59:36,538
You! You did this!

889
00:59:38,373 --> 00:59:40,275
What are you talking about? Troy
did this to Rachel!

890
00:59:40,308 --> 00:59:41,842
You ruined his life! He
is a good boy!

891
00:59:41,875 --> 00:59:43,578
Your son did this to himself.

892
00:59:45,779 --> 00:59:47,515
Stop!

893
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:51,386
He never touched any little
boys. He wouldn't do that!

894
00:59:51,418 --> 00:59:53,422
He won't do that!
What?

895
00:59:53,455 --> 00:59:55,357
He didn't do anything wrong!

896
00:59:55,389 --> 00:59:57,859
He's not a child pornographer!

897
01:00:02,764 --> 01:00:04,933
You okay?
Yeah.

898
01:00:06,668 --> 01:00:08,270
Little boys.

899
01:00:08,737 --> 01:00:10,739
How is that possible?

900
01:00:29,857 --> 01:00:33,828
Hey Nadine, it's Carol. Did you get that
paperwork over to the courthouse for the trial?

901
01:00:33,862 --> 01:00:35,664
Yeah. -Do me a favor, Nadine.
Okay.

902
01:00:35,697 --> 01:00:36,832
Reschedule my appointment with
Barbara Light.

903
01:00:36,864 --> 01:00:38,199
Okay. She just let me know
that she's not coming in.

904
01:00:38,232 --> 01:00:41,669
And get me that info for on
internet log. Do you have lunch?

905
01:00:41,703 --> 01:00:44,373
Yeah, just a sandwich.
You want something?

906
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:54,416
Hello? Carol! Carol!

907
01:00:57,685 --> 01:01:00,021
But it's over, Rach.
They got Troy.

908
01:01:00,755 --> 01:01:03,892
They just brought him in for
questioning. He's probably home by now.

909
01:01:03,924 --> 01:01:05,659
No you guys. Something just
doesn't make sense.

910
01:01:05,694 --> 01:01:10,866
I have never seen anything that would make me
think Troy would be in that kind of stuff.

911
01:01:11,333 --> 01:01:12,868
They posted something of Troy.

912
01:01:13,101 --> 01:01:14,869
On Life Ruiners.
What?

913
01:01:14,902 --> 01:01:16,404
It doesn't make any sense.

914
01:01:17,906 --> 01:01:19,541
You can't see much but you can
see it's him.

915
01:01:19,574 --> 01:01:22,843
Okay that's not a good idea. You can get
arrested for looking at that sort of thing.

916
01:01:22,877 --> 01:01:24,647
Let me see this again.

917
01:01:26,848 --> 01:01:29,784
No. I took this picture of Troy.

918
01:01:29,817 --> 01:01:31,619
Upstairs in my bedroom.
But we were alone.

919
01:01:32,487 --> 01:01:34,723
This is photoshopped.
I knew it! Troy's innocent.

920
01:01:34,755 --> 01:01:36,725
Are you sure, Rachel?
Yes!

921
01:01:36,757 --> 01:01:38,926
If Troy downloaded those
pictures to his computer,

922
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,063
They would have been in the
exact same folder as mine.

923
01:01:41,496 --> 01:01:43,031
Okay, maybe he was hacked.

924
01:01:43,063 --> 01:01:46,000
People do that. They hack your computer
and then they sell its contents online.

925
01:01:46,034 --> 01:01:47,069
There you go. He's innocent.

926
01:01:47,101 --> 01:01:48,302
We have to tell the police.

927
01:01:48,337 --> 01:01:51,005
Hacking is a federal crime.
We're not going to the police.

928
01:01:51,038 --> 01:01:52,440
We'll go to the FBI.

929
01:01:52,473 --> 01:01:55,343
If we can prove that Ashton Banks
has been using hacked materials,

930
01:01:55,377 --> 01:01:57,746
we can get the website
shut down.

931
01:01:57,779 --> 01:02:00,715
Okay, let's go!
No. No. Absolutely not.

932
01:02:00,748 --> 01:02:01,882
Dad, but he's innocent!

933
01:02:01,915 --> 01:02:03,818
You're not being smart.

934
01:02:04,918 --> 01:02:06,121
Could we please go?

935
01:02:06,154 --> 01:02:07,556
We need to finish filling out
the paperwork.

936
01:02:07,589 --> 01:02:10,058
Okay, so we'll finish filling out
the paperwork and then we'll go.

937
01:02:14,828 --> 01:02:15,830
What?

938
01:02:15,864 --> 01:02:18,032
I'm right. Aren't I?

939
01:02:29,143 --> 01:02:32,747
We're sorry. You've
reached a number that

940
01:02:32,781 --> 01:02:36,016
has been disconnected or
no longer in service.

941
01:02:36,049 --> 01:02:37,485
He blocked me.

942
01:02:38,485 --> 01:02:40,554
Listen, we'll go to the police.

943
01:02:40,587 --> 01:02:43,124
They'll sort out everything. I
mean, maybe you're wrong.

944
01:02:44,092 --> 01:02:46,362
You're treating me like a
child now too?

945
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:47,795
No.

946
01:02:48,096 --> 01:02:49,864
Whatever you want to do.

947
01:02:53,967 --> 01:02:55,770
We need to go.

948
01:03:02,476 --> 01:03:05,080
Hi Nadine. This is Barbara
Light, can I speak to Carol?

949
01:03:05,112 --> 01:03:07,114
Carol was hit by a car.
Wait, what?

950
01:03:09,583 --> 01:03:11,118
Nadine, slow down. What happened
to Carol?

951
01:03:15,623 --> 01:03:17,126
Dammit!

952
01:03:20,862 --> 01:03:22,965
Follow me, right
through here.

953
01:03:25,532 --> 01:03:27,002
You're walking kinda funny.

954
01:03:27,034 --> 01:03:28,837
Do you have a hole
in your shoe?

955
01:03:28,869 --> 01:03:30,138
No.

956
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:31,739
Then how'd you get
your foot in it?

957
01:03:31,772 --> 01:03:33,975
Ryan, now? It's always,
a good time for a joke.

958
01:03:34,007 --> 01:03:36,511
Did you hear about the two guys
that stole a calendar?

959
01:03:36,543 --> 01:03:38,078
They both got six months.

960
01:03:38,112 --> 01:03:39,880
Where are we? This
isn't the right way.

961
01:03:39,913 --> 01:03:41,081
Yes it is.

962
01:03:41,114 --> 01:03:43,151
Okay. Why did the rapper carry
an umbrella?

963
01:03:44,118 --> 01:03:45,821
Ryan, this is not the right way.

964
01:03:45,853 --> 01:03:47,855
Fo' drizzle!
Yes it is!

965
01:03:47,889 --> 01:03:50,058
Alright. I'm going to go
back to the main road. Okay.

966
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:51,759
What are you doing?
No.

967
01:03:53,328 --> 01:03:55,964
I was trying to lead you to the police
station. You don't need to go to Troy's.

968
01:03:55,996 --> 01:03:57,031
You too?

969
01:03:57,065 --> 01:03:58,467
Okay, why do you need
to go there?

970
01:03:58,500 --> 01:03:59,967
Because he thinks
everyone hates him, Ryan!

971
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,470
He's all alone.

972
01:04:02,503 --> 01:04:04,473
You still love Troy.

973
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:08,476
Ryan, I really need your help.

974
01:04:08,942 --> 01:04:10,211
You're my best friend.

975
01:04:14,915 --> 01:04:16,484
Please.

976
01:04:22,257 --> 01:04:24,059
I'm gonna go around.

977
01:04:27,929 --> 01:04:28,763
Do you know Troy?

978
01:04:28,795 --> 01:04:29,696
Are you friends with him?

979
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:32,234
What do you think about the
allegations?

980
01:04:32,266 --> 01:04:34,502
Yes, Troy, he's my friend.

981
01:04:34,536 --> 01:04:36,505
He's an okay guy.

982
01:04:36,538 --> 01:04:39,074
Yeah he goes on the computer a
lot, but who doesn't, right?

983
01:04:39,107 --> 01:04:43,645
He spends a lot of time on certain
websites. But not bad ones.

984
01:04:43,677 --> 01:04:46,614
Right. What do you think about
him losing his scholarship?

985
01:05:06,734 --> 01:05:08,569
Troy!

986
01:05:15,944 --> 01:05:17,513
Troy!

987
01:06:02,156 --> 01:06:03,692
What are you doing up there?

988
01:06:04,759 --> 01:06:06,994
You get down or I am
calling the police.

989
01:06:12,333 --> 01:06:14,202
My god! He's overdosing!

990
01:06:22,243 --> 01:06:24,246
Troy! Troy! Troy!

991
01:06:24,779 --> 01:06:26,114
Troy, can you hear me?

992
01:06:26,346 --> 01:06:27,781
Troy, please!

993
01:06:27,815 --> 01:06:28,648
Can you hear me?

994
01:06:28,683 --> 01:06:31,386
God. Yeah, he used my
sleeping pills.

995
01:06:31,418 --> 01:06:32,621
I don't know how many.

996
01:06:32,654 --> 01:06:33,655
At least 15. Maybe 20.

997
01:06:33,688 --> 01:06:37,993
Troy! Troy! Please! Please!
No. No.

998
01:06:38,793 --> 01:06:40,195
I can't tell.

999
01:06:40,694 --> 01:06:41,729
I don't know.

1000
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:44,065
I don't.

1001
01:06:47,735 --> 01:06:50,739
Is that an ambulance?

1002
01:06:58,446 --> 01:07:00,148
102.

1003
01:07:02,282 --> 01:07:04,685
Stupid.
Stupid.

1004
01:07:06,154 --> 01:07:07,688
Rachel, thank you.

1005
01:07:08,221 --> 01:07:10,024
If you hadn't found him...

1006
01:07:10,058 --> 01:07:11,627
He's gonna be okay.

1007
01:07:12,726 --> 01:07:14,362
I don't know.

1008
01:07:19,232 --> 01:07:20,701
He has to be.

1009
01:07:37,118 --> 01:07:39,154
Troy, I know you're innocent.

1010
01:07:40,188 --> 01:07:43,191
Everyone's going to know the
truth, okay? I promise.

1011
01:08:17,525 --> 01:08:19,828
Nadine, when can I visit Carol?

1012
01:08:21,795 --> 01:08:24,732
She's in the ICU, so nobody but family
until the doctors say it's okay.

1013
01:08:24,766 --> 01:08:26,768
Barbara, Carol had me working on
your daughter's case.

1014
01:08:26,801 --> 01:08:28,002
Do you want me to call the FBI?

1015
01:08:28,035 --> 01:08:32,906
No, that's okay. My husband, my
ex-husband already did that.

1016
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:37,277
I don't understand. Like, what? Did
the car just hit her and take off?

1017
01:08:37,311 --> 01:08:40,415
Yeah, there were witnesses.
They said it was a van.

1018
01:08:40,447 --> 01:08:42,718
A van?
Yeah.

1019
01:08:42,917 --> 01:08:44,151
God.

1020
01:08:45,319 --> 01:08:47,789
Barbara? Barbara, are
you still there?

1021
01:08:47,821 --> 01:08:49,156
Yeah, I'm here.

1022
01:08:50,423 --> 01:08:51,926
Yeah the only witness
was this old guy,

1023
01:08:51,959 --> 01:08:54,496
and he said this dark dirty van with
no license plate came out of nowhere,

1024
01:08:54,529 --> 01:08:57,065
hit her and took off.

1025
01:09:17,317 --> 01:09:18,319
Perfect.

1026
01:09:22,589 --> 01:09:25,392
Good work, gentlemen.

1027
01:09:27,261 --> 01:09:29,498
That would be worth a few
thousand clicks.

1028
01:09:30,831 --> 01:09:33,802
Go away. I'm busy.

1029
01:09:33,834 --> 01:09:36,538
Ashton Banks,
open the door.

1030
01:09:37,938 --> 01:09:39,807
I'm busy!
FBI.

1031
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:41,409
Who's this?
Are you Ashton Banks?

1032
01:09:41,442 --> 01:09:46,380
Sir, just put your hands behind
your back, and come with us.

1033
01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:50,450
We're gonna take a little
walk to the car here.

1034
01:09:50,484 --> 01:09:52,320
And ask you a few questions.

1035
01:10:09,303 --> 01:10:11,873
And you're sure it's the
same picture you took.

1036
01:10:11,905 --> 01:10:13,507
Yes, I'll testify to it.

1037
01:10:14,642 --> 01:10:17,579
There's special agents examining
Troy's Hard drive.

1038
01:10:17,978 --> 01:10:19,914
But I'll give them heads up
right away. Thank you.

1039
01:10:19,946 --> 01:10:21,282
Okay.

1040
01:10:23,316 --> 01:10:24,852
How are you doing?

1041
01:10:25,419 --> 01:10:27,455
The hardest part is over,
I guess.

1042
01:10:28,556 --> 01:10:31,526
And that van that was following
you. Have you seen it again?

1043
01:10:31,558 --> 01:10:33,195
No.

1044
01:10:33,393 --> 01:10:34,795
So you haven't found it?

1045
01:10:34,829 --> 01:10:38,834
The guy that attacked you, we found
his vehicle, but that's not it.

1046
01:10:39,667 --> 01:10:43,504
So whoever this is,
is still out there.

1047
01:10:47,475 --> 01:10:50,011
Do you have a ride home?

1048
01:10:50,044 --> 01:10:51,546
My god! Ryan!

1049
01:10:51,579 --> 01:10:53,447
I totally forgot. Can you
give me a ride?

1050
01:10:53,481 --> 01:10:57,185
Yes. Hold on. Rachel,
your mom's on the phone.

1051
01:10:59,085 --> 01:11:01,289
Mom?
Rachel?

1052
01:11:01,321 --> 01:11:02,923
How's Troy?

1053
01:11:07,594 --> 01:11:12,366
It was really scary but he's
going to be fine.

1054
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,668
Rachel I have some news.

1055
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:14,668
What?

1056
01:11:14,701 --> 01:11:19,072
The website is shut down.
It's finally over.

1057
01:11:21,942 --> 01:11:23,477
Rachel?

1058
01:11:23,511 --> 01:11:25,112
Are you there?
Yeah.

1059
01:11:25,146 --> 01:11:27,949
Yeah, that's great!

1060
01:11:27,981 --> 01:11:30,150
I know, right? Can
you believe it?

1061
01:11:30,183 --> 01:11:31,953
He's finally finished.

1062
01:11:32,986 --> 01:11:35,222
That's great. Thank you.

1063
01:11:35,588 --> 01:11:38,426
Love you.
Okay. I love you. Bye.

1064
01:11:41,062 --> 01:11:42,497
Are you ready?
Yeah.

1065
01:11:42,530 --> 01:11:44,331
Yeah, thank you.

1066
01:11:56,377 --> 01:11:59,614
Thank you so much again, Officer Sampson.
I seriously appreciate it. Thank you.

1067
01:12:06,721 --> 01:12:08,522
Hey Ryan, it's me.

1068
01:12:08,556 --> 01:12:12,493
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to leave you. Troy
got sent to the hospital and I just got back.

1069
01:12:12,526 --> 01:12:13,929
Please call me.

1070
01:12:15,562 --> 01:12:16,431
Rachel's home.

1071
01:12:16,463 --> 01:12:18,131
Why didn't you tell Rachel?

1072
01:12:18,164 --> 01:12:19,132
She could have checked on Carol.

1073
01:12:19,165 --> 01:12:20,567
Because this is supposed to be a
happy occasion.

1074
01:12:20,601 --> 01:12:25,339
And Nadine said she would call if
there was any news. So it's fine.

1075
01:12:25,373 --> 01:12:26,441
Rachel!

1076
01:12:27,508 --> 01:12:28,342
Rachel.

1077
01:12:28,375 --> 01:12:31,378
I never got a chance to
say I'm sorry.

1078
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:34,382
For being so,

1079
01:12:35,749 --> 01:12:37,384
at the movie theater.

1080
01:12:38,052 --> 01:12:39,554
I feel totally embarrassed.

1081
01:12:42,556 --> 01:12:44,092
It's all good, Mr. White.

1082
01:12:44,557 --> 01:12:45,525
Thank you.

1083
01:12:45,558 --> 01:12:46,727
Thanks.

1084
01:12:53,167 --> 01:12:54,401
Castle Deli. We cater.

1085
01:12:54,435 --> 01:12:57,105
Hey it's Rachel. Have you seen
Ryan? I can't get a hold of him.

1086
01:12:57,137 --> 01:12:58,372
He quit.

1087
01:12:58,405 --> 01:12:59,439
Ryan quit?

1088
01:12:59,472 --> 01:13:00,573
He didn't tell me that.

1089
01:13:00,607 --> 01:13:02,610
Yeah. Well nobody told me you
were quitting either.

1090
01:13:02,642 --> 01:13:04,011
You just stopped showing up.

1091
01:13:04,044 --> 01:13:06,547
And guess who had to scramble to
cover your shifts just like Ryan.

1092
01:13:06,579 --> 01:13:09,016
Hang on one sec.

1093
01:13:09,816 --> 01:13:11,351
Hello?

1094
01:13:11,384 --> 01:13:14,422
I saw you on Life Ruiners. That's
a nice little bedroom you have.

1095
01:13:14,454 --> 01:13:15,723
Is that where you sleep?

1096
01:13:16,322 --> 01:13:18,593
And people keep calling and
showing up for you.

1097
01:13:18,625 --> 01:13:20,594
And they're not very nice. And I
have to handle it all alone.

1098
01:13:21,161 --> 01:13:24,197
I like your flute. I
can't wait to rape you with it.

1099
01:13:24,231 --> 01:13:25,965
Listen to me you little coward,

1100
01:13:25,999 --> 01:13:31,705
You ever call this number again I will track
you down and ruin your pathetic little life.

1101
01:13:31,739 --> 01:13:35,110
Now, if you'll excuse me, one of
us is still working.

1102
01:13:43,851 --> 01:13:44,819
Ryan! Hey!

1103
01:13:44,852 --> 01:13:46,721
Ryan! My god!

1104
01:14:49,883 --> 01:14:51,151
My god!

1105
01:14:51,185 --> 01:14:52,253
What's going on?

1106
01:14:52,285 --> 01:14:54,521
Call the police! Somebody took
Rachel!

1107
01:14:55,755 --> 01:14:57,558
My god!

1108
01:14:58,191 --> 01:14:59,694
Hold on Rachel.

1109
01:15:06,534 --> 01:15:07,869
My god.

1110
01:15:08,636 --> 01:15:10,504
Come on. Where are you?

1111
01:15:14,607 --> 01:15:15,776
There you are!

1112
01:15:18,178 --> 01:15:20,447
Hold on, Rachel.

1113
01:15:29,656 --> 01:15:32,159
You're not taking my daughter.

1114
01:16:02,789 --> 01:16:04,758
Come on. Come on.

1115
01:16:05,292 --> 01:16:06,326
-Hello?
-Office Sampson?

1116
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:08,663
It's Barbara Light.
What's wrong?

1117
01:16:08,695 --> 01:16:10,730
Someone abducted Rachael!

1118
01:16:10,763 --> 01:16:12,365
Did you see
who took her?

1119
01:16:12,398 --> 01:16:14,634
A green van.
The same as before?

1120
01:16:14,668 --> 01:16:16,337
Yes! The same green van!

1121
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:17,371
No license plates.

1122
01:16:17,405 --> 01:16:18,806
Did you see
which way it went?

1123
01:16:18,838 --> 01:16:20,207
I'm following them right now.

1124
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,942
I'm on San Canyon Road.

1125
01:16:22,610 --> 01:16:23,978
Headed towards Irwindale.

1126
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:25,713
All right Mrs. Light, I
need you to remain calm.

1127
01:16:25,745 --> 01:16:26,813
Don't do anything.

1128
01:16:26,847 --> 01:16:27,949
Hold on. Wait, wait, wait.

1129
01:16:29,516 --> 01:16:31,619
He's turning off on a side
street. Wait. Hold on.

1130
01:16:31,651 --> 01:16:33,286
You're breaking
up.

1131
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:34,487
Officer Sampson, hello?

1132
01:16:34,521 --> 01:16:37,525
Mrs. Light, Mrs.
Light you're breaking up.

1133
01:16:37,958 --> 01:16:39,259
Hello?

1134
01:16:41,027 --> 01:16:42,931
Where are you going?

1135
01:19:25,825 --> 01:19:26,793
Hello?

1136
01:19:26,826 --> 01:19:27,427
Rachel?

1137
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:28,928
Mom?

1138
01:19:28,962 --> 01:19:30,062
Where are you?

1139
01:19:30,097 --> 01:19:32,900
I don't know. I can't
see where I am. It's too dark.

1140
01:19:32,932 --> 01:19:34,468
Come get me.

1141
01:19:37,170 --> 01:19:38,539
Keep talking.

1142
01:19:38,571 --> 01:19:41,574
Mom! Mom please help me!

1143
01:19:41,607 --> 01:19:45,145
Rachel, I'm here. Rachel, don't
stop talking, I'll find you.

1144
01:19:45,178 --> 01:19:50,984
Mom! Mom! It's so dark, I can't see
anything! My hands are tied, I can't move!

1145
01:19:51,017 --> 01:19:52,986
I'm scared!
I'm so scared.

1146
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:55,623
Keep talking. I can't see you.

1147
01:19:55,655 --> 01:19:58,091
It's so dark, I don't
know where I am.

1148
01:20:01,628 --> 01:20:02,563
I'm right here.

1149
01:20:02,596 --> 01:20:04,999
Mom, I'm right here!

1150
01:20:06,165 --> 01:20:07,901
I got you. I got you.

1151
01:20:08,134 --> 01:20:09,536
I got you.

1152
01:20:11,004 --> 01:20:12,473
I got you. Don't worry.

1153
01:20:14,141 --> 01:20:16,444
Mom! Mom! No! Don't!

1154
01:20:23,950 --> 01:20:26,186
Mom! Please!

1155
01:20:30,089 --> 01:20:32,493
Ryan! Stop!

1156
01:20:50,244 --> 01:20:52,913
I can't believe this is
finally happening.

1157
01:20:52,945 --> 01:20:57,951
Are you nervous? I'm
nervous. You smell so good.

1158
01:20:57,985 --> 01:20:59,920
Ryan, stop! You're hurting me.

1159
01:21:01,788 --> 01:21:05,092
Wouldn't want to do that. Wouldn't
want to hurt precious Rachel.

1160
01:21:05,124 --> 01:21:06,125
Just let us go.

1161
01:21:07,794 --> 01:21:09,130
If you let us go now, we
won't tell anyone.

1162
01:21:10,664 --> 01:21:14,969
I promise, please Ryan, this isn't
you, this isn't the Ryan I know.

1163
01:21:15,968 --> 01:21:19,206
Ryan you know, is just a friend.

1164
01:21:19,673 --> 01:21:21,175
A nice guy.
Nothing.

1165
01:21:22,276 --> 01:21:24,612
Ryan, you are my friend.

1166
01:21:30,083 --> 01:21:31,953
Don't lie to me.

1167
01:21:36,088 --> 01:21:38,859
I remember, the first time I saw
you in church.

1168
01:21:39,927 --> 01:21:41,295
You were the prettiest girl I
had ever seen.

1169
01:21:41,329 --> 01:21:45,233
But the problem is, you think
you're better than everyone else.

1170
01:21:48,101 --> 01:21:49,937
So someone had to,

1171
01:21:50,637 --> 01:21:52,273
expose you.

1172
01:21:54,607 --> 01:21:56,576
You remember us sitting in your
room together?

1173
01:21:57,311 --> 01:21:59,213
You thought you were so safe.

1174
01:22:00,981 --> 01:22:03,618
You could have been in there with
a dog. A neutered little puppy.

1175
01:22:08,054 --> 01:22:09,589
Do I feel neutered now?

1176
01:22:14,695 --> 01:22:16,531
I know you're awake.

1177
01:22:21,701 --> 01:22:23,670
And if you hadn't gotten
involved,

1178
01:22:25,638 --> 01:22:27,674
your bitch friend had just kept
her mouth shut,

1179
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:30,009
I wouldn't have to run her down.

1180
01:22:35,281 --> 01:22:37,017
Go to hell, you pig!

1181
01:22:37,618 --> 01:22:40,021
No! Ryan! Please stop!

1182
01:22:40,387 --> 01:22:43,691
You bitch! Ryan, leave
her alone! Ryan!

1183
01:22:50,696 --> 01:22:52,132
Bitch!

1184
01:22:52,164 --> 01:22:53,065
Come on!

1185
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:56,036
Ryan! Stop! Please
leave her alone!

1186
01:23:05,111 --> 01:23:07,013
I got you. I got you. It's okay.

1187
01:23:07,047 --> 01:23:09,183
It's okay. It's okay.

1188
01:23:11,718 --> 01:23:13,020
He's out.

1189
01:23:13,053 --> 01:23:15,623
It's okay.
It's okay.

1190
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:47,788
God. Baby!

1191
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:49,188
Daddy!

1192
01:23:58,764 --> 01:24:00,101
You okay?

1193
01:24:01,834 --> 01:24:03,436
Some thing's seriously
wrong with you.

1194
01:24:03,469 --> 01:24:05,204
You could have gotten killed.

1195
01:24:05,237 --> 01:24:08,275
I'm sorry.

1196
01:24:31,164 --> 01:24:33,134
Hi!

1197
01:24:35,302 --> 01:24:38,339
I missed you guys so much!

1198
01:24:38,739 --> 01:24:41,407
You guys miss me?
Yeah!

1199
01:25:16,476 --> 01:25:18,145
How's your arm doing?

1200
01:25:18,178 --> 01:25:20,147
Pretty good, considering.

1201
01:25:21,514 --> 01:25:22,850
Sorry about that.

1202
01:25:22,883 --> 01:25:23,884
It's okay.

1203
01:25:35,227 --> 01:25:37,830
Rachel is really good.

1204
01:25:39,465 --> 01:25:41,102
Yes, she is.
