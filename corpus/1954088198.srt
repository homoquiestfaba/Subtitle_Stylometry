00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,289
         My coach               
         always told me         

4
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,592
       that in order            
       to achieve success       

5
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:29,328
       you must visualize       
       your dreams.             

6
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,631
    But more importantly,       
    you have to believe it.     

7
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:36,068
     For me, that vision        
     has always been clear.     

8
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,371
         NBA superstar

      the love of my life.

       If this all sounds       
       farfetched to you,       

11
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:53,085
      you probably haven't      
      seen me play.             

12

     My name is Chris Long.     

13
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:58,223
          And tonight           

14
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:01,727
     I realize my destiny.      

15
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,228
 ¶ If it weren't for the boy

       whatever he did ¶        

17
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:06,031
     ¶ Wasn't good enough       

18
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:07,566
        ¶ Was different         
        than every kid ¶        

19
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:08,700
       ¶ But wait,              
       deep down inside ¶       

20
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:10,569
 ¶ There was a genius within    

21
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,971
  ¶ And his heart was of gold   
  and hope was eager to win ¶   

22
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:14,506
    ¶ Was so sick and tired     
    of all these people ¶       

23
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:16,108
      ¶ Sneaking on him

 ¶ No, he would come and attack 
 by the evil again ¶            

25
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:19,745
   ¶ And his family's poor      

26
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,513
      ¶ He swore he would       
      feed them again ¶         

27
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:23,916
¶ But on his way out there goes 
the Grim Reaper again ¶         

28
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:25,217
       ¶ They put him in        
       the coliseum ¶           

29
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:26,952
  ¶ To be food for the lions

 ¶ But he cut right through 'em 
 like the man on fire ¶         

31
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,856
        ¶ With my heart         
        of Leonidas ¶

00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:32,791
      ¶ He fought through       
      all them riots ¶          

33
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:35,961
 ¶ Cause he was one bad man     
 stick his nose to the choir ¶  

34
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:37,830
     ¶ But this world           
     was deep in for you ¶      

35
00:01:37,832 --> 00:01:40,699
     ¶ Bloodlines went back     
     to the people ¶            

36
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:44,002
 Look at this crowd,            
 the feeling here is electric.  

37
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:46,438
     All that anticipation      
     for this epic showdown     

38
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,041
    between LA Tech             
    and Rock Falls Pioneers.    

39
00:01:49,043 --> 00:01:51,276
     But the big story here     
     is the heroic play         

40
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,112
  of senior phenom Chris Long.  

41
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:55,080
     He has literally put       
     this team on his back      

42
00:01:55,082 --> 00:01:57,916
  and carried them into         
  their first final appearance  

43
00:01:57,918 --> 00:01:59,351
          in 23 years.          

44
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:00,219
        How about that?         

45
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:01,487
      That's right, Jeff.       

46
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:03,522
    Chris Long has had four,    
    count 'em,                  

47
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:05,724
        four consecutive        
        Temple doubles.         

48
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:07,860
        He shows no sign        
        of stopping.            

49
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:11,029
   He will easily go top five   
   in the draft this year.      

50
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:12,197
           Top five?            

51
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,532
     What's wrong with you?     

52
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:14,933
    How about the top pick?     

53
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:16,502
     How do you spell MVP?      

54
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:17,803
          Chris Long.           

55
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:21,573
        Watch out NBA,          
        here comes Long.        

56
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:24,443
  Okay, Kim is a ho for sho'.   

57
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:28,080
    Chris deserves so much      
    better than her.            

58
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:29,448
   Brittany, it's your turn.

60
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:31,116
             Truth.

   Who would you rather fuck?   

62
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:35,787
   David Beckham, Tom Brady,    
   or Chris Long?               

63
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,122
        Duh, Chris Long!

  were you serious about that?

116
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:21,420

127
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,576

     financial institutions     

128
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:46,511
        work with rules

       It keeps us out of       
       economic des--           

131
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,884

  economic destruction

134
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,255
       but we've learned.       

135
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:59,124
 Probably a lot of it was from  
 giving loans                   

136
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:01,360
  to people like you, let's be  
  honest, I'm just saying.      

137
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,995
  And I don't appreciate        
  the death stare, by the way,  

138
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:06,732
  so if you could put that      
  in your pocket as you leave.  

139
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:08,600

   Stop being a little bitch.   

263
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:18,309
    Todd said not all of us     
    are gonna get fired.        

264
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:21,279
   Does that mean some of us    
   getting fired.               

265
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:22,313
     Big changes are coming     
     Todd,

     it's gonna be awesome.     

267
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,884
       Oh, can you change       
       the lock on that?        

268
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:27,986
  I'm gonna hit the Starbucks   
  for a green tea latte.        

269
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:31,523
    I'll be back in 20-ish,     
    all right?                  

270
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:32,624
         Ah, Schmitty.          

271

 You hit that club last night?  

273
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:37,362
    I heard it was hopping.     

274
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:40,231
    Oh, yeah, your world's      
    about to get fucked up.     

275

277
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:50,842
           What's up?           

278
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:52,077
   You tell us, motherfucker.   

279
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:52,944
      We have a new owner?      

280
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:54,512
      What about your dad?      

281
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:55,947
 He uh, said he was tired       
 of losing money on a business  

282
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:57,515
    just to keep me employed    

283
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,784
  and he wishes he would have   
  strapped up 30 years ago.     

284
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:01,086
    Well, we can't be fired.    

285
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:03,288
   In this freaking economy,    
   no one is hiring             

286
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,056
   and I know because I tried   
   to find extra work.          

287
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:05,990
        Okay, calm down.        

288
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:07,358
    Nobody's getting fired.     

289
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,894
     Uh, Todd, who is this      
     Jack Guy guy anyway?       

290
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,463
        You stinky pigs.        

291
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:14,065
 Do you realize you have        
 a business unattended outside? 

292
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,500
         Anybody care?          

293
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:17,802
  And your gross sewage pipes   
  are leaking stank             

294
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:20,105
         into my salon.         

295
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:22,006
      Meh, meh, meh,            
      meh, meh, meh, meh.       

296
00:12:22,008 --> 00:12:23,308
      That's all I heard.       

297
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,144
Take the dicks                  
out of your ears, genius, okay? 

298
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:27,879
    Because Todd, I told you    
    last week.                  

299
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:29,380
      I told you the week       
      before that.              

300
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:33,017
   And you told him the week    
   before that, too, bitch.     

301
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,252
        "Beach", really?        

302
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,221
       Okay, people love        
       the beach.               

303
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,824
  -Welcome to America, bitch.   
  -Oh, really?                  

304
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:44,195
  Ironic coming from a girl     
  that looks like a Chihuahua.  

305
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:45,330
       What is this,            
       "West Side Story"?       

306
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:46,364
    You guys aren't gonna do    
    nothing?                    

307
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:47,532
   You're gonna stand there?    

308
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,300
       Did you guys             
       choreograph this?        

309
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:50,735
  Well, if you put this much    
  effort into your goddamn gym  

310
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:53,805
   it wouldn't suck             
   so fucking bad, all right?   

311
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:55,073
   Peace out, motherfuckers.    

312
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:57,041
      Smell that,               
      that's much better.       

313
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:58,343
   Did you know he currently    
   holds the title              

314
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:01,112
       world's first ever       
       male supermodel?         

315
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,414
  He's dated Kate Beckinsale,   
  Cameron Diaz,                 

316
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,317
    and is currently married    
    to Adriana Lima.            

317
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:10,388
     The Victoria's Secret      
     supermodel?                

318
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,490
      I bet even his dick       
      has a six pack.           

319
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:14,692
   And he's an all Ivy League   
   quarterback for Yale.        

320
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:18,029
   Record breaker,              
   28 touchdowns in one game.   

321
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:19,664
   How do you know all this?    

322
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:23,001
 I Google, Facebook, MySpace,   
 Wikipedia, and Twittered him.  

323
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:24,869
       Plus, he told me.        

324
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,638
         Holy Sherlock.         

325
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,974
     Check her out, homes.      

326
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,243

       slippery fuck toy.       

329
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:46,024
     Uh, yeah, what I would     
     do to her                  

330
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,826
        would be illegal        
        in most states.         

331
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:49,828
           Holy shit.

      You mean Gay Namath?      

334
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:56,534
   Bet I can tell you           
   exactly what he's saying.

   Negativo, operating hours    
   remain the same.             

377
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:32,697
  So then how can we be called  
  25/8?                         

378
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,766
           Perception           

379
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,000
          is reality.

        Dumbbells 25/8,         

381
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,570
      but we're still open      
      from six to nine.         

382
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:40,705
              Wow.              

383
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,407
       Actually Cliff,          
       in today's economy       

384
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:44,609
   reality shows have proven    
   to be a viable mechanism     

385
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,912
  to increase business profits  
  by as much as 300%.           

386
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:49,147
       Like "Sunset Tan".       

387
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:50,715
       Precisely, Bobby.        

388
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:51,950
     Three hundred percent?     

389
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,584
  And speaking of percentages,  

390
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:56,421
I'm gonna need everybody to give
that little bit extra.          

391
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:59,958
   So if you've been at 100,    
   I need you at 150.           

392
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,859
   And if you've been at 10%,   

393
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:04,862
      I suggest a complete      
      attitude adjustment.      

394
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:10,268
                               ¶

395
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,970
      Attitude adjustment?      

396
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:15,006
      Ten fucking percent?      

397
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:17,976
Okay, so now Mr. Hollywood says 

398
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:20,411
   we won't get any extra pay   
   or benefits                  

399
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:21,813
     for being on the show.     

400
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,749
    And he wants us to sign     
    some bullshit contract.     

401
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:25,483
           Contract?            

402
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,952
    Don't sign no contract.     

403
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:28,786
            I quit.             

404
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,021
       I am fucking done.       

405
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:32,190
     I would rather deliver     
     pizza for Domino's         

406
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:35,927
 than work for Captain Fuckwad.

       [speaking Spanish]       

408
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:41,065
I thought about going pro,      
but with so many modeling offers

409
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:44,135
    I figured, why risk it.     

410
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:45,136
     Cliff, may I help you?     

411

     Actually, it's Chris.      

412

  He's uh, he's good looking.

415
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,482
   Too bad he's also married.   

416
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:59,283
            I know.

             Yeah.              

429

     You wanted to see me?

              Yes.

      First and foremost,       

438
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:42,293
     I've got two troubling     
     words for you.             

439
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:46,798
          Cock block.           

440
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,398
           I'm sorry?           

441
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,333

442
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:52,270
     So you were hitting on     
     your niece?                

443
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,205
        It's a metaphor.        

444
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:56,607
           This show            

445
00:17:56,609 --> 00:18:00,344
        is like my fat,         
        pulsating cock.         

446
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:02,980
  And nobody's gonna block it.  

447
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:05,583
      And, Mr. Smart Alec,      

448
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:06,984
       you didn't know          
       she was my niece.        

449
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:07,885
             But--              

450
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:09,420
     But nothing, tall guy.     

451
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,255
     Todd told me you were      
     some sort of

     That's great,              
     I was an athlete, too.     

454
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:17,795
     But I guess your coach     
     didn't teach you           

455
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:20,865
      about a little thing      
      known as teamwork.        

456
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:23,835
    You go outside right now    
    and you ask ten people,     

457
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:26,204
    even girls, if they like    
    a cock block.               

458
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:28,639

              Hey.              

506
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,384
   I'm glad you didn't pull     
   a LeBron on us, teammate.    

507
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,453
      That's me, go team.       

508
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:24,455
         Come on,               
         let's do this.         

509
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:26,357
      Day one of the rest       
      of your life.             

510
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:31,596
                               ¶

511
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:33,064
       ¶ I do my thing          

512
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,533
      ¶ Girl on the ground      
      when I do my thing ¶      

513
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:37,235
   ¶ I'm at the gym all day     

514
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:39,036
 ¶ Bet your boyfriend wouldn't  
 try to do the same ¶           

515
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:40,938
      ¶ I walk around           
      struttin' my stuff ¶      

516
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,873
 ¶ Short shorts for the ladies  
 trying to check my stuff ¶     

517
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,875
   ¶ Yeah, baby, you can look   
   but you sure can't touch ¶   

518
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:47,278
¶ You ain't ready for my lovin' 
'cause I like it rough ¶        

519
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,213
         ¶ I know you           
         want my body ¶         

520
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:51,882
   ¶ The same as everybody      

521
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:53,317
             Small.             

522
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,953
      Thank you, Jack Guy.      

523
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:57,455
             Jesus.             

524
00:20:57,457 --> 00:21:01,425
            Really?             

525
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:02,660
            Come on!            

526
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:07,565
     Who sweats this much?      

527
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:10,434
           Fuck you,            
           fuck you.            

528
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:14,105
 ¶ You should take a picture    
 'cause it lasts a lot longer ¶ 

529
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:17,241
      ¶ Longer, longer          

530
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:18,542
              Ah.               

531
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:20,878
     What sweating problem?     

532
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,816
                               ¶

533
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:28,119
             Ahhh.              

534
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,921
       Feels so good            
       to work out high.        

535
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:33,190
 What's up, Enrique I-gay-sius? 

536
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:35,526
 What are you doing in the gym  
 during serious training hour?  

537
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,228
     Filming a show, right?     

538
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,330
      Since when do you         
      wanna film the show?      

539
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:41,065
     Bobby, leave me alone.     

540
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:43,134
         Ah, I got it.          

541
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,136
      What are you, "Ah,        
      I getting it" about?      

542
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:47,104
 You wanna finger Jack's niece  
 under a blanket.               

543
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:50,675
    So, I guess you made up     
    with my uncle.              

544
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:54,045
     -Hi.                       
     -Wow, you, you look...     

545
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:56,781
            ...fit.             

546
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:57,782
     Okay, this is awkward.     

547
00:21:57,784 --> 00:22:00,751
       Great compliment.        

548
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:04,055
   So, you're the Chris Long.   

549
00:22:04,057 --> 00:22:05,856
     You didn't think I'd       
     figure it out, did ya?     

550
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:09,460
    I didn't really take you    
    for a basketball fan.       

551
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:10,895
       Wait, basketball?        

552
00:22:10,897 --> 00:22:13,964
   No, I was, I was referring   
   to the fish.                 

553
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:14,899
             Fish?              

554
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:17,301
         It was signed          
         "Chris Long"?          

555
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:18,669
         The painting.          

556
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,305
          Right, yes.           

557
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:22,340
              Duh.              

558
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:23,941
    Wow, I'm, I'm impressed.    

559
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:26,277
 I can't believe you were able  
 to read my signature,          

560
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:29,847
  most people tell me it just   
  looks like a C with a scar.   

561
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,482
    Good morning, everyone.     

562
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:33,184
   Welcome to                   
   the Dumbbells experience.    

563
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:35,186
   But first I'd like us all    
   to give a big, warm,         

564
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:38,122
       Dumbbells welcome        
       to our very own          

565
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:39,323
        Dumbbell Girls.         

566
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:43,427
                               ¶

567
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:44,895
    I'd also like us to give    
    a big hand                  

568
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:47,031
to our very acclaimed director, 

569
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,699
      famous for his            
      award-winning short,      

570
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:53,204
   "I Think It's HPV"           
   Mr. Sterling LeBoef Jones.   

571
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:56,307
       [speaking French]        

572
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,978
     So now we're gonna do      
     a little b-roll.           

573
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,249
    So please do me a fave,     
    just pair up, work out,     

574
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:07,318
     and, most importantly,     
     just mingle.               

575
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,221
      Pretend like              
      we're not even here.      

576
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:13,591
    Remember, it's all about    
    looking hot.                

577
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:16,060
        So don't sweat.         

578
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,828
      All right,                
      Dumbbells team out,       

579
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,798
         let's do this.         

580
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,068
       So we're partners,       
       right?                   

581
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:29,140
          Yes, yes,             
          yes, we are.          

582
00:23:29,142 --> 00:23:30,808
          Yeah, sorry.          

583
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,810
          That's cool.          

584
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:34,945
      I went to law school      
      for a few years           

585
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:36,480
 and then I thought to myself,  

586
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:38,082
        "Why the hell           
        am I doing this?        

587
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:38,716
         "I hate this."         

588
00:23:38,718 --> 00:23:40,284
           So I quit.           

589
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:43,721
 But I discovered what I loved  
 which was psychotherapy.       

590
00:23:43,723 --> 00:23:45,122
         Psychotherapy?         

591
00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:47,358
       Yup, I'm gonna be        
       a therapist.             

592
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,459
            Really?             

593
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:49,727
         Yeah, really.          

594
00:23:49,729 --> 00:23:51,028
   Why, you sound surprised.    

595
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,563
      No, it's just funny       
      because people            

596
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:55,332
 are always telling me          
 that I need therapy every day, 

597
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:56,700
      "You need therapy".       

598
00:23:56,702 --> 00:24:00,538
    Great stuff, keep going,    
    I love the honesty.         

599
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:04,508
   Physical therapy, I mean.    

600
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:07,978
        And that is why         
        I work out here.        

601
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,282
      Let's go, Dumbbells!      

602
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:12,983
   Can you believe this shit?   

603
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:16,387
     Yeah, it's a total         
     exploitation of women.     

604
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:18,055
    I'm talking about Chris.    

605
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:20,891
  He's actually talking to her  
  as if she's a person.         

606
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:24,762
   So what I wanna know is      
   other than adorable fish,    

607
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:27,398
    what else do you paint?     

608
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,866
             Um...              

609
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:31,836
   I uh, I don't really paint   
   that much anymore.           

610
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:32,970
          You're good.          

611
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,839
     You should keep at it.     

612
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:36,307
     Are you drinking soda?     

613
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:37,942
       Are you out of           
       your fucking mind?       

614
00:24:37,944 --> 00:24:40,311
     I don't put that shit      
     in my body.                

615
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:41,512
     I'm downing some COC.      

616
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:43,113
   Cellular Oxygen Creatine.    

617
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:45,449
 A liquid formula that triples  
 my amino acid circulation      

618
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:48,152
   while quadrupling            
   my recovery time by five.    

619
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:49,220
 Plus, it tastes like cherries. 

620
00:24:49,222 --> 00:24:50,454
              Woo!              

621
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:53,691
 Are we ready for               
 the exciting part of the show? 

622
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:56,427
           [applause]           

623
00:24:56,429 --> 00:24:59,830
  In a few minutes we'll begin  
  the athletic competitions     

624
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,333
      to determine              
      the King of the Gym.      

625
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:03,901
           Yes, yes!            

626
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:05,436
      I'm fucking stoked!       

627
00:25:05,438 --> 00:25:09,807
   But first, I'm very proud    
   to introduce                 

628
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:12,810
        our very own            
        celebrity host.         

629
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:15,513
       Drum roll, please.       

630
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:18,849
   With great pleasure          
   I would like to introduce

658
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:31,055
      I don't want to do

     reality TV they make

    is when they make porn.

       it's not artistic.

   like you have to do this,

       I appreciate that,       

679

    but I think I can handle    

680
00:27:11,998 --> 00:27:14,531
     a little reality show      
     competition.               

681
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:16,600
    You know, Sigmund Freud     
    said                        

682
00:27:16,602 --> 00:27:20,104
   "The ego is not the master   
   in its own house."           

683
00:27:20,106 --> 00:27:23,941
 I thought he said,             
 "The rhythm is gonna get ya."  

684
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:26,343
  Just be careful, all right?   

685
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:29,380
      Did she just imply        
      that I have an ego?       

686
00:27:29,382 --> 00:27:31,849
          Little bit.

 physical therapists

     really good progress.      

742
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:24,855
      The Miami Heat even       
      invited me

     Did Chris Bosh step on     
     your hand, too?            

760
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,199
            Oh, wow!

     just threw up

     in front of my salon,      

766
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,577

   blasting.

         -Hello.

00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:26,817
   Yeah, I just,                
   I have some schoolwork...    

772
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:28,218
         You know what?         

773
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,254
  You can talk to               
  your girlfriend later, okay?  

774
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:31,521
      Ivana, listen, okay?      

775
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:33,123
      I know when you were      
      a little brat             

776
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,892
 your dad gave you all the      
 puppies and ponies you wanted, 

777
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:37,794
 but in the adult world you can 
 take a time fucking out.       

778

         You know what?

00:31:38,831 --> 00:31:41,231
 Time fucking in, Mister, okay? 

780
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,333
   Because it wasn't a pony,    
   it was a stallion.           

781
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:45,469
     His name was Prancer,      
     and he was perfect.        

782
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:49,306
       And now he's dead,       
       so fuck you.             

783
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,478

      the internet.

     anyone was still here.

   Come on, spill the beans.    

834
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,766
        You remind me of        
        my friend Tantu.        

835
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:31,034
             Tantu?             

836
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:33,837
   Tantu Tantutututinko,        
   my Native American friend.   

837
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,472
       He was a chef            
       at the local diner       

838
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:37,107
   at the reservation where     
   I do my sweat lodges         

839
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:38,308

840

    Let me tell ya,             
    nobody can poach an egg     

841
00:34:40,212 --> 00:34:41,611
          like Tantu.           

842
00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:43,280
     He used to always say      
     that he was fine,          

843
00:34:43,282 --> 00:34:44,481
         but he wasn't.         

844
00:34:44,483 --> 00:34:46,049
    I could see it all over     
    his Indian face             

845
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:49,920
 and I see the same look        
 on your face right now, Chris. 

846
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:52,289
         Can you stop?          

847
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:56,293
           Just stop.           

848
00:34:56,295 --> 00:34:57,327
             Okay.              

849
00:34:57,329 --> 00:35:00,530
       I know what to do.       

850
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:04,401
    Get comfortable, buddy.     

851
00:35:04,403 --> 00:35:06,169
      What are you doing?       

852
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:08,271
              Bro.              

853
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:11,341
     Therapy saved my life.     

854
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:12,509
             Okay.              

855
00:35:12,511 --> 00:35:14,544
       And how does that        
       apply to me?             

856
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:17,147
     I don't need therapy.      

857
00:35:17,149 --> 00:35:19,316
    What is with you people?    

858
00:35:19,318 --> 00:35:21,685
         She said that          
         she loved me           

859
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:23,954
    and she didn't love me.     

860
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:27,157
  She left,                     
  she didn't even say goodbye,  

861
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:28,992
        she left a note.        

862
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:31,328
    It wasn't even goodbye.     

863
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:33,663
       And then I say,          
       "Guess what, Kim?        

864
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:35,499
    "I don't even wanna play    
    in the NBA anyway,

    whiten your teeth again?

    "Why don't you throw up     
    that hamburger

870
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:44,741
  "I can hear it every time!"   

871
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:47,310
      I guess what bothers      
      me the most               

872
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:50,947
  is obsessively pondering      
  over what I could have been.  

873
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:52,616
       My true potential.       

874
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:57,721
    NBA star,                   
    happily married to Kim,     

875
00:35:57,723 --> 00:36:01,558
      or anything other         
      than what I am now.       

876
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,928
    Chris, sometimes we need    
    to lose everything          

877

     in order to discover

      that we really are.       

879
00:36:10,536 --> 00:36:11,835

880

      It's a magnet             
      on my refrigerator.

        Sounds like             
        a fucking bitch.        

884
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,683
    I just, I don't get her.    

885
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,018
            Why now?            

886
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,887
I mean, where's she been        
and why do I still give a shit? 

887
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:33,690
  Don't beat yourself up, pal.  

888
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,992
         Every woman's          
         got a vagenda.         

889
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:39,362
  The question is whether       
  it's the right one for you.   

890
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:41,031
     Did you say "vagenda"?     

891
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:44,601
 That injury was the best thing 
 that could ever happen to you. 

892
00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:48,104
  That injury saved your life.  

893
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:51,808
      Do you really think       
      the two of you            

894
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,277
      could have ever           
      been happy together?      

895
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:56,813
              Yes.              

896
00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:59,182
              No.               

897
00:36:59,184 --> 00:37:00,317
         You know what?         

898
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:01,384
      You're right again.       

899
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,620
        I don't,                
        I don't need her        

900
00:37:03,622 --> 00:37:06,056
       and I don't need         
       her daddy's money,       

901
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:08,858
      and I've got things       
      going on in my life.      

902
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,595
  I've got, I've got Jack Guy.  

903
00:37:11,597 --> 00:37:14,264
    I've got Dumbbells 25/8,    
    right?                      

904
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:18,101
     That's right, brother.     

905
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:20,537
         You know what?         

906
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:22,339
     I feel good right now.     

907
00:37:22,341 --> 00:37:24,207
         I feel clear.          

908
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:27,510
  I feel one with the universe  
  or something.                 

909
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:29,646
     I feel, I feel taller.     

910
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:31,014
         I feel light.          

911
00:37:31,016 --> 00:37:33,450
  Everybody should try therapy  
  at least once.                

912
00:37:33,452 --> 00:37:36,620
  It's not like people haven't  
  tried to tell me that.        

913
00:37:36,622 --> 00:37:38,088
       Especially Missy.        

914
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:41,424
Did you know that Missy and Dre 
take a two hour bus ride        

915
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:42,826
     to get here every day?     

916
00:37:42,828 --> 00:37:44,294
        -From downtown.         
        -Really?                

917
00:37:44,296 --> 00:37:48,064
     I feel like I've been      
     a jerk to those guys.      

918
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:50,900
    I feel like I wanna do      
    something nice for them.    

919
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:56,673
   Well, we could start         
   by brightening their day.    

920
00:37:56,675 --> 00:38:02,879
                               ¶

921
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:06,049
  Hey, dumbass, did you forget  
  to lock the door last night?  

922
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:07,684
     I was a little tipsy.      

923
00:38:07,686 --> 00:38:09,452
    Wait, do you hear music?    

924
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:13,657
                               ¶

925
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:16,860
      ¶ I used to think         
      maybe you loved me ¶      

926
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:19,229
     ¶ Now baby I'm sure        

927
00:38:19,231 --> 00:38:22,198
                               ¶

928
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,068
      ¶ And I just can't        
      wait till the day ¶       

929
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:27,170
         Good morning!          

930
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:28,805
     First, I'd like to say     

931
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:32,809
    that I think you're both    
    equally amazing             

932
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:35,345
     and I'm sorry from         
     the bottom of my heart     

933
00:38:35,347 --> 00:38:37,247
      for being an a-hole.      

934
00:38:37,249 --> 00:38:39,115
        And I appreciate        
        both of you.            

935
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:42,719
     You see, Missy,            
     you are like my rock.      

936
00:38:42,721 --> 00:38:45,755
     You're my foundation       
     that keeps me sturdy.      

937
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:47,624
     And, Dre, you're like      
     the rainbow                

938
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:49,793
 that shines above those rocks. 

939
00:38:49,795 --> 00:38:52,395
  And not like a gay rainbow,   
  but a masculine rainbow       

940
00:38:52,397 --> 00:38:53,663
       with muted colors.       

941
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:57,534
    Who are you and what        
    have you one with Chris?    

942
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:00,570
       Hey, there he is!        

943
00:39:00,572 --> 00:39:02,205
         Day two, baby.         

944
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:04,574
          Nice wheels.          

945
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:05,642
        Something wrong?        

946
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:06,843
  Yeah, you know what's wrong.  

947
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,511
      Your check bounced,       
      you asshole.              

948
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:09,846
             What?              

949
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:11,381
  There must be some mistake.   

950
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:13,450
   I mean, come on, Fabs,       
   you know I'm good for it.    

951
00:39:13,452 --> 00:39:16,219
  Listen, don't call me Fabs,   
  it's Fabio.                   

952
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:17,020
             Fabio.             

953
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:17,954
              -Io.              
              -Io.              

954
00:39:17,956 --> 00:39:20,290
      -Io, io, you idiot.       
      -Fabio.                   

955
00:39:20,292 --> 00:39:21,858
      Let's go inside,          
      everyone's waiting.       

956
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,426
       You screw me over,       
       and you know what?       

957
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:25,628
          Nobody fucks          
          with Fabio.           

958
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,630
    I've got plenty of money    
    in that account!            

959
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:30,900
             Fabio!             

960
00:39:30,902 --> 00:39:32,102
             Damn.              

961
00:39:32,104 --> 00:39:39,209
                               ¶

962
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:42,946
             What?              

963
00:39:42,948 --> 00:39:44,881
              No!               

964
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,049
              No!               

965
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:49,786
     Let's just say the man     
     has a vision.              

966
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:52,389
          Big changes           
          are coming.           

967
00:39:52,391 --> 00:39:54,557
      There's the genius!       

968
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:55,792
      Saul, where are you?      

969
00:39:55,794 --> 00:39:58,895
    I've got a big problem,     
    call me back!               

970
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,498
                               ¶

971
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,466
       What uh, is wrong?       

972
00:40:03,468 --> 00:40:05,068
          Fabio quit.           

973
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,136
         Let me guess.          

974
00:40:06,138 --> 00:40:08,004
       There was too much       
       dialogue for him.        

975
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:09,739
        Why, why,               
        why did he quit?        

976
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:11,841
      Because he's a dick.      

977
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:13,410
      And the check             
      I wrote him bounced.      

978
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:14,611
              Oh.               

979
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:15,845
   I called my money manager,   
   Saul,                        

980
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:17,380
     but what it means is,      
     you know,                  

981
00:40:17,382 --> 00:40:19,849
  I gotta send everybody home   
  and still pay for it.         

982
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:22,352
     All right, we'll find      
     a new host, right?         

983
00:40:22,354 --> 00:40:24,087
   Chris, I just can't, like    
   go on the internet           

984
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:25,855
      to CelebrityHost.com      
      and push a button.        

985
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:27,223
      It's not that easy.       

986
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:29,325
    Not to mention I've got     
    the cast and crew here      

987
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:30,360
    for two days, that's it.    

988
00:40:30,362 --> 00:40:31,728
        Well, let's take        
        a time out              

989
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:32,862
  and let's think about this,   
  all right?                    

990
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:34,297
        We need a host,         
        we need a host.         

991
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:37,200
   We need someone charming,    
   someone personable,          

992
00:40:37,202 --> 00:40:42,505
   someone who's not a dick,    
   um...                        

993
00:40:42,507 --> 00:40:43,540
              Duh!              

994
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:45,008
           Jack Guy!            

995
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,776
     You've done a million      
     modeling campaigns,        

996
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,211
   you've traveled the world,   

997
00:40:48,213 --> 00:40:50,346
  you've always been in front   
  of the camera.                

998
00:40:50,348 --> 00:40:54,184
   You should host the show.    

999
00:40:54,186 --> 00:40:58,121
     Well, I did guest star     
     on a soap opera once.      

1000
00:40:58,123 --> 00:40:59,989
 That's what I'm talking about, 
 baby!                          

1001
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:01,558
     Look out this window,      
     all right?                 

1002
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,059
  This is your vision, buddy.   

1003
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:07,263
                               ¶

1004
00:41:07,265 --> 00:41:08,765
   We're all looking through    
   the point of view            

1005
00:41:08,767 --> 00:41:10,867
   of our own reality tunnel.

      that Fabio's Protein

 known as Octaurean Lifestyles

      fuck those people.

1089
00:44:39,778 --> 00:44:43,212
         you know that?         

1090
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:46,749
             Jack.

      You tell me, Tantu.       

1095
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:00,863
    Adriana never loved me.     

1096
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:03,666
       She said she did,        
       but she didn't.          

1097
00:45:03,668 --> 00:45:07,336
She went away on a photo shoot, 
she never even came back.       

1098
00:45:07,338 --> 00:45:09,505
    She ran off with            
    some German photographer

1101
00:45:12,477 --> 00:45:13,342
         Dirk the jerk.         

1102
00:45:13,344 --> 00:45:16,879
I didn't join the cult, mother! 

1103
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:19,115
      No one joins a cult!      

1104
00:45:19,117 --> 00:45:20,983
       I was brainwashed!       

1105
00:45:20,985 --> 00:45:22,852
        I mean, my God,         
        they told me            

1106
00:45:22,854 --> 00:45:24,620
    I was saving the world!     

1107
00:45:24,622 --> 00:45:26,823
  They said, "Sign here,        
  you'll help save the world."  

1108
00:45:26,825 --> 00:45:28,157
           I signed.            

1109
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:30,293
    Wh-, what would you do?     

1110
00:45:30,295 --> 00:45:31,794
        Did that answer         
        your question?          

1111
00:45:31,796 --> 00:45:36,933
  Yes, yes, I did think         
  the spaceships were coming!   

1112
00:45:36,935 --> 00:45:39,535
      I guess what bothers      
      me the most is that       

1113
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:42,205
     no one ever seems          
     to take me seriously.      

1114
00:45:42,207 --> 00:45:46,008
  Even in the cult my nickname  
  was Dipshit.                  

1115
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:48,711
       I remember the day       
       I escaped.               

1116
00:45:48,713 --> 00:45:51,547
        February second,        
        Groundhog Day.          

1117
00:45:51,549 --> 00:45:53,616
    I was running butt naked    
    through the forest          

1118
00:45:53,618 --> 00:45:56,419
with nothing but a squirrel pelt
and my dignity                  

1119
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:57,053
        to keep me warm,        

1120
00:45:57,055 --> 00:45:59,922
        but I got away.         

1121
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:02,458
    That was the first day      
    that I really questioned    

1122
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,828
 my decision to change my name  
 to Jack Guy.                   

1123
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:08,030
     What's your real name?     

1124
00:46:08,032 --> 00:46:10,366
        Phil Wienerman.         

1125
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:12,168
    Wait a second,              
    what should I call you?     

1126
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:15,238
         Jack or Phil?          

1127
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,906
         I don't know.          

1128
00:46:16,908 --> 00:46:20,109
   Actually, I was thinking     
   of changing my name again.   

1129
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:24,080
        I always liked          
        the name "Jim".         

1130
00:46:24,082 --> 00:46:26,282
    Considering that you        
    wanna be taken seriously    

1131
00:46:26,284 --> 00:46:29,118
and you own a fitness club now, 

1132
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:33,022
     "Jim Guy" might not be     
     the best option.           

1133
00:46:33,024 --> 00:46:35,158
        I'm just saying.        

1134
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,093
         There you go.          

1135
00:46:37,095 --> 00:46:38,961
     Listen, I just wanted      
     to thank you again         

1136
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:41,297
      for helping my uncle      
      through this.             

1137
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:43,199
        I know he can be        
        a bit eccentric.        

1138
00:46:43,201 --> 00:46:45,568
          No, no, no,           
          it's fine,            

1139
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:46,936
       it's my pleasure.        

1140
00:46:46,938 --> 00:46:47,837
      Well, you're sweet.       

1141
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:51,874
       You're sweet, too.       

1142
00:46:51,876 --> 00:46:54,677
     Well, till next time.      

1143
00:46:54,679 --> 00:46:58,614
                               ¶

1144
00:46:58,616 --> 00:47:01,150
          Cool Vespa.           

1145
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:02,018
         You know what?         

1146
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,453
        On Saturdays um,        

1147
00:47:04,455 --> 00:47:06,622
  we take the underprivileged   
  kids that I work with         

1148
00:47:06,624 --> 00:47:09,625
     to the park to get         
     some outdoor activity.     

1149
00:47:09,627 --> 00:47:12,361
      I was thinking maybe      
      you could come by         

1150
00:47:12,363 --> 00:47:15,765
 and show 'em some              
 basketball moves or something. 

1151
00:47:15,767 --> 00:47:19,101
   Yeah, that sounds awesome.   

1152
00:47:19,103 --> 00:47:20,169
             Cool.              

1153
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:23,840
    So um, Pan Pacific Park,    
    one PM.                     

1154
00:47:23,842 --> 00:47:28,344
       Pan Pacific Park,        
       one PM.                  

1155
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:31,314
   Once again I'm uh,           
   I'm really, really sorry.    

1156
00:47:31,316 --> 00:47:33,716
      Due to my current         
      financial situation       

1157
00:47:33,718 --> 00:47:36,919
       and the failure of       
       the reality show         

1158
00:47:36,921 --> 00:47:40,356
 why doesn't everyone just      
 take the rest of the week off. 

1159
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:41,858
    We'll plan to reconvene     
    on Monday.                  

1160
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:44,293
   But uh, in light of          
   everything that's happened   

1161
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:47,230
       unless some sort         
       of miracle occurs,       

1162
00:47:47,232 --> 00:47:49,932
 I strongly encourage everyone  
 to explore                     

1163
00:47:49,934 --> 00:47:51,634
        other employment        
        opportunities.          

1164
00:47:51,636 --> 00:47:56,072
  Three days of working here,   
  you get us shut down?         

1165
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:12,121
                               ¶

1166
00:48:12,123 --> 00:48:14,790
     ¶ Lately seems             
     you've been distant ¶      

1167
00:48:14,792 --> 00:48:19,428
    ¶ Or maybe I just           
    don't read you so well ¶    

1168
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:21,564
                               ¶

1169
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:24,500
        ¶ What you want         
        in an instant ¶         

1170
00:48:24,502 --> 00:48:26,669
  ¶ Would say with your eyes    

1171
00:48:26,671 --> 00:48:31,607
     ¶ It's getting harder      
     to tell ¶                  

1172
00:48:31,609 --> 00:48:36,445
    ¶ And I want you to know    
    I'm trying ¶                

1173
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:41,417
       ¶ Trying the best        
       that I can ¶             

1174
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:45,488
       ¶ And if our love        
       is slowly dying ¶        

1175
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:48,357
     ¶ I want you to know       

1176
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:51,193
        ¶ Where I stand         
        in my heart ¶           

1177
00:48:51,195 --> 00:48:53,930
    ¶ My heart, my heart        

1178
00:48:53,932 --> 00:48:55,097
         You're early.          

1179
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,365
       It's been a while.       

1180
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:59,335
       I figured I could        
       use the practice.        

1181
00:48:59,337 --> 00:49:03,039
                               ¶

1182
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:04,941
  Let's play some basketball.   

1183
00:49:04,943 --> 00:49:06,275
    All right guys, back up,    

1184
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:08,144
  we're gonna work on defense,  
  okay?                         

1185
00:49:08,146 --> 00:49:09,345
    Let's see what you got.     

1186
00:49:09,347 --> 00:49:10,646
 ¶ If it weren't for the boy    

1187
00:49:10,648 --> 00:49:11,914
       ¶ Who felt like          
       whatever he did ¶        

1188
00:49:11,916 --> 00:49:13,082
     ¶ Wasn't good enough       

1189
00:49:13,084 --> 00:49:14,583
        ¶ Was different         
        than every kid ¶        

1190
00:49:14,585 --> 00:49:15,918
       ¶ But wait,              
       deep down inside ¶       

1191
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,586
 ¶ There was a genius within    

1192
00:49:17,588 --> 00:49:20,189
  ¶ And his heart was of gold   
  and hope was eager to win ¶   

1193
00:49:20,191 --> 00:49:21,390
    ¶ Was so sick and tired     
    of all these people ¶       

1194
00:49:21,392 --> 00:49:22,992
      ¶ Sneaking on him         

1195
00:49:22,994 --> 00:49:25,261
 ¶ No, he would come and attack 
 by the evil again ¶            

1196
00:49:25,263 --> 00:49:26,629
   ¶ And his family's poor      

1197
00:49:26,631 --> 00:49:28,431
      ¶ He swore he would       
      feed them again ¶         

1198
00:49:28,433 --> 00:49:30,833
¶ But on his way out there goes 
the Grim Reaper again ¶         

1199
00:49:30,835 --> 00:49:32,134
       ¶ They put him in        
       the coliseum ¶           

1200
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:33,869
  ¶ To be food for the lions    

1201
00:49:33,871 --> 00:49:36,472
 ¶ But he cut right through 'em 
 like the man on fire ¶         

1202
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:37,974
        ¶ With my heart         
        of Leonidas ¶           

1203
00:49:37,976 --> 00:49:39,442
¶ He fought through the riots   

1204
00:49:39,444 --> 00:49:40,543
   ¶ Cause he's one bad man     

1205
00:49:40,545 --> 00:49:42,178
¶ Gave his notes to the choir   

1206
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:45,314
     ¶ But this world           
     was deep in for you ¶      

1207
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:47,516
     ¶ Bloodlines went back     
     to the people ¶            

1208
00:49:47,518 --> 00:49:50,386
   ¶ You gotta fight way out,   
   it can be done ¶             

1209
00:49:50,388 --> 00:49:52,755
 ¶ But in him dwells the heart  
 of a champion ¶                

1210
00:49:52,757 --> 00:49:55,691
 ¶ Never quit, never lose hope, 
 overcome ¶                     

1211
00:49:55,693 --> 00:49:58,961
     ¶ Never fear to fly,       
     you can be the one ¶       

1212
00:49:58,963 --> 00:50:02,765
        Oh, come on,            
        that's not fair.        

1213
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:07,203
                               ¶

1214
00:50:07,205 --> 00:50:08,137
          Hey, there.           

1215
00:50:08,139 --> 00:50:09,572
              Wow.              

1216
00:50:09,574 --> 00:50:12,274
    Aren't you amazing          
    with the kids, who knew?    

1217
00:50:12,276 --> 00:50:13,743
           Thank you.           

1218
00:50:13,745 --> 00:50:16,412
   Now that brings us to        
   a little bit of a surprise   

1219
00:50:16,414 --> 00:50:18,547
      that I have for you.      

1220
00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:19,181
             What?              

1221
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:20,516
            Ta-dah!             

1222
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:23,319
      I figured we'd            
      have to eat, right?       

1223
00:50:23,321 --> 00:50:25,788
         Check it out.          

1224
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:30,326
      Peach and raspberry       
      cobbler pie.              

1225
00:50:30,328 --> 00:50:32,561
           Wow, um...           

1226
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:34,730
             Chris.             

1227
00:50:34,732 --> 00:50:35,831
              I...              

1228
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:37,366
       Hey, Manny,              
       what's up, buddy?        

1229
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:39,268
      If you're such            
      a superstar player,       

1230
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:41,404
    how come you can't dunk?    

1231
00:50:41,406 --> 00:50:42,538
          Kids, right?          

1232
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,573
        Well, uh, Manny,        
        as you can see          

1233
00:50:44,575 --> 00:50:48,177
  I don't exactly have          
  the best knee anymore, so...  

1234
00:50:48,179 --> 00:50:49,712
  I still don't think you can.  

1235
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:52,181
 Well, actually used to be able 
 to dunk pretty well            

1236
00:50:52,183 --> 00:50:52,982
        back in the day.        

1237
00:50:52,984 --> 00:50:54,784
         Then prove it.         

1238
00:50:54,786 --> 00:50:55,951
      Are you bullying me?      

1239
00:50:55,953 --> 00:50:59,121
    I got ten baseball cards    
    that says you can't.        

1240
00:50:59,123 --> 00:51:00,122
              Ooh!              

1241
00:51:00,124 --> 00:51:01,357
    All right, okay, Manny,     

1242
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:03,559
       why don't we             
       stop bugging Chris       

1243
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:05,728
       and thank him for        
       coming out today.        

1244
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:08,931
 I guess since his girlfriend's 
 rescuing him                   

1245
00:51:08,933 --> 00:51:10,199
     I'll leave him alone.      

1246
00:51:10,201 --> 00:51:13,335
        Especially since        
        he's chicken.           

1247
00:51:13,337 --> 00:51:14,603
             Manny!             

1248
00:51:14,605 --> 00:51:17,440
       No, Rachel,              
       it's totally cool.       

1249
00:51:17,442 --> 00:51:20,876
    Ten baseball cards, huh?    

1250
00:51:20,878 --> 00:51:23,746
       Listen, you do not       
       have to do this.         

1251
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:26,949

   we can do for you,

     what am I doing here?      

1374
00:55:51,382 --> 00:55:54,883
     I've come back to you.     

1375
00:55:54,885 --> 00:55:56,285
              Kim.              

1376
00:55:56,287 --> 00:55:59,388
       Uh, you should go.       

1377
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:01,256
              Why?              

1378
00:56:01,258 --> 00:56:05,994
                               ¶

1379
00:56:05,996 --> 00:56:07,796
          Chrissy-poo.          

1380
00:56:07,798 --> 00:56:10,666
    I know that you think I     
    wasn't very nice to you     

1381
00:56:10,668 --> 00:56:12,368
          in the past.          

1382
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:14,370
     But we were kids then.     

1383
00:56:14,372 --> 00:56:19,408
    We're not kids anymore.     

1384
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:22,311
         That tickles.          

1385
00:56:22,313 --> 00:56:25,314
    By the way, Daddy said      
    you could start at 100.     

1386
00:56:25,316 --> 00:56:27,049
           $100,000?            

1387
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:30,152
             Uhhuh.             

1388
00:56:30,154 --> 00:56:32,654
      Okay, Kim, Kim, Kim!      

1389
00:56:32,656 --> 00:56:34,656
    I need to know why now?     

1390
00:56:34,658 --> 00:56:35,958
          Why not now,          
          I'm horny.            

1391
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:38,594
        No, Kim, why now        
        all of a sudden         

1392
00:56:38,596 --> 00:56:40,963
    do you wanna be with me?    

1393
00:56:40,965 --> 00:56:43,165
  Chris, I've always loved you  

1394
00:56:43,167 --> 00:56:46,168
     and when you got hurt      
     I was scared.              

1395
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:48,470
   I didn't know what to do,    
   it was hard for me.          

1396
00:56:48,472 --> 00:56:49,605
        You were scared?        

1397
00:56:49,607 --> 00:56:50,773
        I was the one--         

1398
00:56:50,775 --> 00:56:52,674
       I had my walls up.       

1399
00:56:52,676 --> 00:56:56,745
   And now they are way down.   

1400
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:57,679
           Ah, okay.            

1401
00:56:57,681 --> 00:56:59,782
    Oh, there's my big boy.     

1402
00:56:59,784 --> 00:57:01,750
       There he is, okay.       

1403
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:05,154
        Kim, stop, stop,        
        Kim, Kim!               

1404
00:57:05,156 --> 00:57:06,288
       I need to ask you,       

1405
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:09,658
    have you ever apologized    
    to anybody for anything     

1406
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:12,194
      in your entire life?      

1407
00:57:12,196 --> 00:57:13,796
              Ew.               

1408
00:57:13,798 --> 00:57:16,765
      So this is my eighth      
      voicemail now.            

1409
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:18,033
      Jack, no one              
      has heard from you,       

1410
00:57:18,035 --> 00:57:19,568
 I'm starting to get concerned. 

1411
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:20,335
         Where are you?         

1412
00:57:20,337 --> 00:57:21,203
         Call me back.          

1413
00:57:21,205 --> 00:57:23,672
             Jack?              

1414
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:32,014
             Jack?              

1415
00:57:32,016 --> 00:57:46,929
                               ¶

1416
00:57:46,931 --> 00:57:49,965
     I have a weapon and I      
     will fuck you up, man!     

1417
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:53,302
     I am a weapon and I        
     will fuck you up more!     

1418
00:57:53,304 --> 00:57:54,303
             Jack?              

1419
00:57:54,305 --> 00:57:56,572
             Chris?             

1420
00:57:56,574 --> 00:57:57,739
             Jesus.             

1421
00:57:57,741 --> 00:58:00,642
    Holy cow, what happened     
    to your hair?               

1422
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:02,077
       I know it's them!        

1423
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,045
           Supercuts?           

1424
00:58:03,047 --> 00:58:05,180
      Turn the lights off,      
      get down.                 

1425
00:58:05,182 --> 00:58:05,814
              Why?              

1426
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:06,648
       Were you followed?       

1427
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:07,816
         I don't know.          

1428
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:09,585
    Did you talk to anyone?     

1429
00:58:09,587 --> 00:58:10,619
        My grandmother.         

1430
00:58:10,621 --> 00:58:11,520
   What-, what are you doing?   

1431
00:58:11,522 --> 00:58:12,387
     Let me see your teeth.     

1432
00:58:12,389 --> 00:58:13,322
    Why are you touching me?    

1433
00:58:13,324 --> 00:58:15,524
       Stop touching me.        

1434
00:58:15,526 --> 00:58:17,826
         Ow, ow, Jack!          

1435
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:18,627
           Say "ah".            

1436
00:58:18,629 --> 00:58:21,563
          Ah, ah, ah!           

1437
00:58:21,565 --> 00:58:24,466
              Ah!               

1438
00:58:24,468 --> 00:58:25,868
         You're clean.          

1439
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,736
         What the hell?         

1440
00:58:27,738 --> 00:58:29,872
            Listen.             

1441
00:58:29,874 --> 00:58:31,673
        I know this all         
        seems crazy.            

1442
00:58:31,675 --> 00:58:35,277
 But remember my money manager, 
 Saul Rosenblattsteinberg?      

1443
00:58:35,279 --> 00:58:38,480
    The guy who got arrested    
    for the Ponzi scheme?       

1444
00:58:38,482 --> 00:58:41,316
  Well, years ago I introduced  
  Saul to the cult.             

1445
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:43,252
   So this weekend              
   the damn cult kidnapped me   

1446
00:58:43,254 --> 00:58:46,522
because Saul stole over         
three million dollars from them.

1447
00:58:46,524 --> 00:58:49,558
  They thought I was in on it.  

1448
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,159
    You have forsaken us all    
    again.                      

1449
00:58:51,161 --> 00:58:53,128
       I'm so sorry,            
       Benevolent Leader.       

1450
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:55,030
I didn't know Saul was a crook. 

1451
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:56,765
   He took me for everything,   

1452
00:58:56,767 --> 00:58:58,667
  and you bastards sill owe me  
  six million.                  

1453
00:58:58,669 --> 00:59:02,237
             Stop!              

1454
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:04,640
    Nobody's gonna take you     
    seriously, Phil.            

1455
00:59:04,642 --> 00:59:07,209
    You are a total fuck up.    

1456
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:11,013
  We tire of your resistence    
  and your incompetence.        

1457
00:59:11,015 --> 00:59:13,015
        The end of days         
        is upon us.             

1458
00:59:13,017 --> 00:59:17,019
The spaceships are coming       
and you shall learn your lesson.

1459
00:59:17,021 --> 00:59:18,587
            No, no!             

1460
00:59:18,589 --> 00:59:23,358
       Not the hair, no!        

1461
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,294
  It's probably for the best    
  that I forget about the gym   

1462
00:59:25,296 --> 00:59:26,328
          for a while.          

1463
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:29,064
       I gotta deal with        
       these assholes.          

1464
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:32,901
    Chris, sorry I couldn't     
    turn things around.         

1465
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:37,539
    Two hearts becoming one.    

1466
00:59:37,541 --> 00:59:40,709
 Our beautiful Kimmy and Chris, 
  <i>salute.</i>                       

1467
00:59:40,711 --> 00:59:44,346
          Cheers, Sir.          

1468
00:59:44,348 --> 00:59:46,481
           Oh, Chris.           

1469
00:59:46,483 --> 00:59:48,250
          Guess what?           

1470
00:59:48,252 --> 00:59:50,586
  Daddy's getting us a condo.   

1471
00:59:50,588 --> 00:59:53,121
      It is so beautiful,       
      I've seen pictures.       

1472
00:59:53,123 --> 00:59:55,624
  And there's an extra bedroom  
  so we can convert it          

1473
00:59:55,626 --> 00:59:57,025
     into a closet for me.      

1474
00:59:57,027 --> 00:59:58,894
      Nothing is too good       
      for my princess.          

1475
00:59:58,896 --> 00:59:59,728
        Is it, princess?        

1476
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:00,662
              No.               

1477
01:00:00,664 --> 01:00:01,897
      Look at her, Chris.       

1478
01:00:01,899 --> 01:00:03,198
     Isn't she a princess?      

1479
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,933
 She is definitely a princess.  

1480
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:06,802
        I am a princess!        

1481
01:00:06,804 --> 01:00:08,337
     Here we are, Princess.     

1482
01:00:08,339 --> 01:00:12,341
 Fat free, sugar free,          
 gluten free vegan lettuce cups 

1483
01:00:12,343 --> 01:00:14,276
         minus the rice         
         and the oil,           

1484
01:00:14,278 --> 01:00:17,813
 which I'm sure is much tastier 
 than the chef always makes it. 

1485
01:00:17,815 --> 01:00:18,914
            Jeffry.             

1486
01:00:18,916 --> 01:00:20,716
    Thank you so much, Sir.     

1487
01:00:20,718 --> 01:00:25,153
   Jeffry, um, is that corn?    

1488
01:00:25,155 --> 01:00:26,788
              Yes.              

1489
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:28,790
             Aaahh!             

1490
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:30,492
             Gross!             

1491
01:00:30,494 --> 01:00:32,527
           -Take it!            
           -Jeffry.             

1492
01:00:32,529 --> 01:00:34,663
     Sir, I'm so sorry,         
     I'm a horrible person      

1493
01:00:34,665 --> 01:00:37,065
  and I will go improve myself  
  around the corner.            

1494
01:00:37,067 --> 01:00:40,936
   How difficult is it          
   for them to get it right?    

1495
01:00:40,938 --> 01:00:44,506
        I'm gonna go            
        to the bathroom.        

1496
01:00:44,508 --> 01:00:45,741
    You gotta respect that.     

1497
01:00:45,743 --> 01:00:47,342
   She knows what she wants.    

1498
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:48,310
            Respect.            

1499
01:00:48,312 --> 01:00:51,480
             Yeah.              

1500
01:00:53,282 --> 01:00:54,850
         What the hell          
         are you doing?         

1501
01:00:54,852 --> 01:00:56,151
            Eating?             

1502
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:57,519
      Put down the knife        
      and fork, fuck head.      

1503
01:00:57,521 --> 01:00:58,787
     Come on, respect her.      

1504
01:00:58,789 --> 01:01:00,622
     Wait for your princess     
     to come back.              

1505
01:01:00,624 --> 01:01:01,556
         Sorry, my bad.         

1506
01:01:01,558 --> 01:01:02,557
        My bad, my bad?         

1507
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:03,759
  Who are ya, Snoop Dogg, now?  

1508
01:01:03,761 --> 01:01:04,693
           I'm sorry.           

1509
01:01:04,695 --> 01:01:05,861
      You hear me, homey?       

1510
01:01:05,863 --> 01:01:06,862
            Pardon?             

1511
01:01:06,864 --> 01:01:08,697
  No, no, I think I know you.   

1512
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:10,065
  You're one of those assholes  

1513
01:01:10,067 --> 01:01:12,267
     that plays basketball      
     every night, right?        

1514
01:01:12,269 --> 01:01:13,869
Right, and then you're listening
to your rap music               

1515
01:01:13,871 --> 01:01:15,303
   with your hippie friends.    

1516
01:01:15,305 --> 01:01:16,872
     And you're probably on     
     narcotics right now,       

1517
01:01:16,874 --> 01:01:18,106
          huh, Cheech?          

1518
01:01:18,108 --> 01:01:20,375
     No, no, Sir,               
     you have me all wrong.     

1519
01:01:20,377 --> 01:01:23,045
  When it comes to my daughter  
  she is my everything.         

1520
01:01:23,047 --> 01:01:26,081
 So you hurt her,               
 you so much as disrespect her, 

1521
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:28,450
     and I'm sending people     
     to your house.             

1522
01:01:28,452 --> 01:01:29,384
            <i>Capisce?</i>            

1523
01:01:29,386 --> 01:01:30,552
            <i>Capisce.</i>            

1524
01:01:30,554 --> 01:01:32,587
      I'm gonna run to          
      the restroom myself       

1525
01:01:32,589 --> 01:01:35,290
        really quickly.         

1526
01:01:35,292 --> 01:01:37,325
              Ah!               

1527
01:01:37,327 --> 01:01:39,494
  Hi, it's Rachel,              
  leave a message at the beep.  

1528
01:01:39,496 --> 01:01:40,729
             [beep]             

1529
01:01:40,731 --> 01:01:42,431
          Hey, baby,            
          it's Craig.           

1530
01:01:42,433 --> 01:01:44,232
         Why don't you          
         call me back?          

1531
01:01:44,234 --> 01:01:46,535
  We can work through this,     
  we can talk this out, okay?   

1532
01:01:46,537 --> 01:01:48,503
         Call me back.          

1533
01:01:48,505 --> 01:01:49,271
             [beep]             

1534
01:01:49,273 --> 01:01:51,339
   It was just a rub and tug.   

1535
01:01:51,341 --> 01:01:54,843
  It's not that big of a deal,  
  it was a massage, okay?       

1536
01:01:54,845 --> 01:01:58,246
That bitch was just masturbating
with her hand on top of mine.   

1537
01:01:58,248 --> 01:02:00,615
   without mine being there.    

1538
01:02:00,617 --> 01:02:01,883
         You know what?         

1539
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:03,418
      I be banging bitches      
      left and right.           

1540
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:05,854
    You don't know shit,        
    you don't know nothing,     

1541
01:02:05,856 --> 01:02:06,988
       I don't need you.        

1542
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:09,291
             Peace.             

1543
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,129
      So, as you can see,       

1544
01:02:14,131 --> 01:02:16,498
       the living room          
       is very spacious.        

1545
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:19,167
      Well, I, I see            
      that there's a pool,      

1546
01:02:19,169 --> 01:02:20,769
 but where's the tennis court?  

1547
01:02:20,771 --> 01:02:23,739
   We were told this property   
   has a tennis court.          

1548
01:02:23,741 --> 01:02:26,508
  Where do you expect us to go  
  when the servants             

1549
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:28,410
    are cleaning the house?     

1550
01:02:28,412 --> 01:02:30,278
          Uh, well um,          

1551
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:32,047
   there's a ping pong table    
   in the basement.             

1552
01:02:32,049 --> 01:02:33,548
         How dare you?          

1553
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:36,952
   I have not been practicing   
   my backhand for nothing.     

1554
01:02:36,954 --> 01:02:39,020
    And why is there so much    
    furniture in this room?     

1555
01:02:39,022 --> 01:02:40,722
    Well, Ma'am, sometimes      
    we furnish the houses       

1556
01:02:40,724 --> 01:02:42,424
 to give the prospective buyers 
 a better idea                  

1557
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:43,925
    of what it will be like     
    once they--                 

1558
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:46,828
And that trim is pretty shitty, 
who did that?                   

1559
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:47,662
             Jack?              

1560
01:02:47,664 --> 01:02:48,897
           Jack who?            

1561
01:02:48,899 --> 01:02:50,165
      Is he in the union?       

1562
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:55,137
     He's speaking to you,      
     dimwit.                    

1563
01:02:55,139 --> 01:02:57,873
   I have explosive diarrhea,   

1564
01:02:57,875 --> 01:03:01,343
    so I will be right back.    

1565
01:03:01,345 --> 01:03:03,178
       He's not a dimwit.       

1566
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:05,080
     You have to have a wit     
     to be dim.                 

1567
01:03:05,082 --> 01:03:06,414
            -Right.             
            -Jack.              

1568
01:03:06,416 --> 01:03:07,916
       Call me Lonestar,        
       lay low.                 

1569
01:03:07,918 --> 01:03:09,851
         Lonestar, why?         

1570
01:03:09,853 --> 01:03:11,453
      No time to explain.       

1571
01:03:11,455 --> 01:03:19,361
                               ¶

1572
01:03:19,363 --> 01:03:20,695
      Bianca, Bianca,           
      you gotta see this.       

1573
01:03:20,697 --> 01:03:22,097
         Where are you?         

1574
01:03:22,099 --> 01:03:24,266
 Bianca, this,                  
 what are you doing down there? 

1575
01:03:24,268 --> 01:03:25,834
    I can't let you do this.    

1576
01:03:25,836 --> 01:03:26,635
            Do what?            

1577
01:03:26,637 --> 01:03:27,402
             This.              

1578
01:03:27,404 --> 01:03:28,103
          Look at you.          

1579
01:03:28,105 --> 01:03:28,937
          Look at me?           

1580
01:03:28,939 --> 01:03:30,539
       Jack, look at you.       

1581
01:03:30,541 --> 01:03:33,708
  You don't think I look good   
  as a brunette?                

1582
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:35,610
   I'm happy right now, okay?   

1583
01:03:35,612 --> 01:03:38,847
   I've got my life together,   
   I've got money,              

1584
01:03:38,849 --> 01:03:39,948
       things are great.        

1585
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:41,249
  Oh, everything's great, huh?  

1586
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:43,118
        Oh, come on,            
        open your eyes.         

1587
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,419
         Is this really         
         what you want?         

1588
01:03:44,421 --> 01:03:46,321
       -Yes, yes, it is.        
       -All right, look.        

1589
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:47,556
   I'll be the first to admit   
   I lost my marbles there      

1590
01:03:47,558 --> 01:03:49,090
      for a little while.       

1591
01:03:49,092 --> 01:03:51,126
  But I'm back and I've never   
  been more clear on anything.  

1592
01:03:51,128 --> 01:03:52,661
   The cult tried to kill my    
   dreams.                      

1593
01:03:52,663 --> 01:03:54,496
  I'm never gonna let anybody   
  ever do that again.           

1594
01:03:54,498 --> 01:03:55,530
        I can't give up.        

1595
01:03:55,532 --> 01:03:57,432
       Not on the gym,          
       and not on myself.       

1596
01:03:57,434 --> 01:03:59,601
   And you shouldn't either.    

1597
01:03:59,603 --> 01:04:00,101
             Jack.              

1598
01:04:00,103 --> 01:04:00,936
           Lonestar.            

1599
01:04:00,938 --> 01:04:02,571
        Lonestar, look.         

1600
01:04:02,573 --> 01:04:06,842
  Even if I did wanna           
  quit this job and dump Kim,   

1601
01:04:06,844 --> 01:04:10,212
      the gym's shut down       
      and you're broke.         

1602
01:04:10,214 --> 01:04:11,580
          Not anymore.          

1603
01:04:11,582 --> 01:04:14,282
     I've got a plan,           
     but I need your help.      

1604
01:04:14,284 --> 01:04:17,919
      You are a foul,           
      horrible young man.       

1605
01:04:17,921 --> 01:04:19,454
           Horrible.            

1606
01:04:19,456 --> 01:04:23,625
   I'm gonna call your office   
   and file a complaint.        

1607
01:04:23,627 --> 01:04:27,329
  My God, Jack, this is like,   
  freakishly good.              

1608
01:04:27,331 --> 01:04:29,197
     One great thing about      
     being in a cult,           

1609
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:30,899
planning to take over the world 
every day                       

1610
01:04:30,901 --> 01:04:32,968
   makes you very meticulous    
   and a great strategist.      

1611
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:34,269
      You know what else?       

1612
01:04:34,271 --> 01:04:36,104
  I think we should do a whole  
  grassroots                    

1613
01:04:36,106 --> 01:04:37,772
social media marketing campaign.

1614
01:04:37,774 --> 01:04:39,307
   I love it, let's do that!    

1615
01:04:39,309 --> 01:04:41,610
       Let's get to work.       

1616
01:04:41,612 --> 01:04:43,311
        Oh, man, really?        

1617
01:04:43,313 --> 01:04:44,679
     Can I get one day off?     

1618
01:04:44,681 --> 01:04:45,881
      My freaking armpits.      

1619
01:04:45,883 --> 01:04:48,383
     Your hyperhydrosis is      
     acting up again, huh?      

1620
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:49,217
             What?              

1621
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:50,518
       You poor bastard.        

1622
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,820
You haven't figured it out yet, 
have you?                       

1623
01:04:51,822 --> 01:04:53,255
         Let me guess.          

1624
01:04:53,257 --> 01:04:55,724
You've tried every              
antiperspirant known to mankind.

1625
01:04:55,726 --> 01:04:57,125
             Yeah.

  not even clinical strength.

01:10:56,987 --> 01:10:59,387
       We need this money       
       to save Dumbbells.       

1748

    All right, motherfucker.    

1750
01:11:05,128 --> 01:11:08,863
 I want you to listen to me,    
 and I want you to listen well. 

1751
01:11:08,865 --> 01:11:11,699
       Your organization        
       owes my client           

1752
01:11:11,701 --> 01:11:16,037
upwards of six million dollars. 

1753
01:11:16,039 --> 01:11:17,605
           American.            

1754
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:22,176
   My client has suffered       
   from anxiety, depression,

01:11:22,178 --> 01:11:24,145
     erectile dysfunction--     

1756
01:11:24,147 --> 01:11:26,247
  I, I have that last problem   
  under control now.            

1757
01:11:26,249 --> 01:11:31,085
   And I will not stop until    
   justice has been upheld,     

1758
01:11:31,087 --> 01:11:34,188
        my bald friends.

        What do ya got?         

1760
01:11:35,558 --> 01:11:38,393
   Are you dentists familiar    
   with the iPhone              

1761
01:11:38,395 --> 01:11:39,761
      audio recorder app?       

1762
01:11:39,763 --> 01:11:42,530
Well, lucky for me my client was
during your little              

1763
01:11:42,532 --> 01:11:44,399
      routine kidnapping.       

1764
01:11:44,401 --> 01:11:46,301
     Do you remember that?

         not the hair!          

1767
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:56,844
     Anything but the hair,     
     no!                        

1768
01:11:56,846 --> 01:12:02,050

        Fuck this goat.         

1772
01:12:12,562 --> 01:12:14,529
             Yeah.              

1773
01:12:14,531 --> 01:12:16,397
        [goat bleating]         

1774
01:12:16,399 --> 01:12:20,268
Oh, and uh, that is not         
the only copy of that recording.

1775
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:22,103
        I got that shit         
        on my iCloud.           

1776
01:12:22,105 --> 01:12:23,905
           What's up?           

1777
01:12:23,907 --> 01:12:26,607
     So if you love bugs        
     try any funny business     

1778
01:12:26,609 --> 01:12:29,877
      I will have the FBI       
      and the CIA and TMZ       

1779
01:12:29,879 --> 01:12:33,448

  stink on baboon, my friend.

     Take that to the bank,     
     dipshits!                  

1785
01:12:47,097 --> 01:12:48,396
        Hey,                    
        where you going?

1788
01:12:53,036 --> 01:12:54,369
          Not anymore.          

1789
01:12:54,371 --> 01:12:55,203
      How's my hair look?       

1790
01:12:55,205 --> 01:12:56,571
         It looks fine.         

1791
01:12:56,573 --> 01:12:58,139
         -Are you sure?         
         -Yeah.                 

1792
01:12:58,141 --> 01:12:59,874
      Let's just go back        
      to the gym, instead.      

1793
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:01,409
   Are you not familiar         
   with Eckhart Tolle's book    

1794
01:13:01,411 --> 01:13:02,510
        "Power of Now"?

         seize the day.         

1796
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:05,380
       I'll speak to her        
       eventually.              

1797
01:13:05,382 --> 01:13:06,447
        You just took on        
        a whole cult.           

1798
01:13:06,449 --> 01:13:07,415
   You can talk to my niece.    

1799
01:13:07,417 --> 01:13:08,516
   What am I supposed to say?   

1800
01:13:08,518 --> 01:13:10,218
    I'll do all the talking,    
    relax.                      

1801
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:12,286
           Hey, Rach.           

1802
01:13:12,288 --> 01:13:15,656
 Uncle Jack, Chris,             
 what are you guys doing here?  

1803
01:13:15,658 --> 01:13:19,127
 Chris will explain everything. 

1804
01:13:19,129 --> 01:13:20,161
           Hey, guys.           

1805
01:13:20,163 --> 01:13:23,231
       Who wants to play        
       a little HORSE?          

1806
01:13:23,233 --> 01:13:27,335
   So, once again, I'm,         
   I'm really sorry that uh,    

1807
01:13:27,337 --> 01:13:30,438
   that I didn't respond to     
   any of your text messages.   

1808
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:33,374
  That was, that was immature.  

1809
01:13:33,376 --> 01:13:35,777
     Well, look, I'm sorry.     

1810
01:13:35,779 --> 01:13:38,579
        For everything.         

1811
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:40,815
      So we're both sorry.      

1812
01:13:40,817 --> 01:13:43,217
I know, why don't we start over.

1813
01:13:43,219 --> 01:13:44,352
              Hi.               

1814
01:13:44,354 --> 01:13:45,353
           I'm Chris.           

1815
01:13:45,355 --> 01:13:46,454
          I'm Rachel.           

1816
01:13:46,456 --> 01:13:47,789
        So who is Jack?         

1817
01:13:47,791 --> 01:13:49,424
   Oh, Tom Jones over there?    

1818
01:13:49,426 --> 01:13:50,591
     That's my sugar daddy.     

1819
01:13:50,593 --> 01:13:51,225
           I knew it!           

1820
01:13:51,227 --> 01:13:52,593
             Mhmm.              

1821
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:54,862
  I cannot believe you thought  
  that when we first met.       

1822
01:13:54,864 --> 01:13:56,764
      I have a lot of deep      
      core rooted issues        

1823
01:13:56,766 --> 01:13:59,066
     stemming from              
     my childhood, mostly.      

1824
01:13:59,068 --> 01:14:00,501
        Eat it, chew it,        

1825
01:14:00,503 --> 01:14:03,638
    how does failure taste?     

1826
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:07,341
  All right, well, I guess I    
  should get back to the kids.  

1827
01:14:07,343 --> 01:14:10,745
  But, thanks for stopping by.  

1828
01:14:10,747 --> 01:14:14,315
    Would you like to go out    
    sometime?                   

1829
01:14:14,317 --> 01:14:15,817
             Chris.             

1830
01:14:15,819 --> 01:14:19,754
        You are a super,        
        super sweet guy         

1831
01:14:19,756 --> 01:14:22,323
     and you made me laugh,     

1832
01:14:22,325 --> 01:14:25,893
     but I just need time.      

1833
01:14:25,895 --> 01:14:29,363
                               ¶

1834
01:14:29,365 --> 01:14:30,598
           Of course.           

1835
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:31,466
            Totally             

1836
01:14:31,468 --> 01:14:32,733
      I mean, I, I get it.      

1837
01:14:32,735 --> 01:14:35,837
       You just broke up        
       with your fiancé,        

1838
01:14:35,839 --> 01:14:38,506
      you need some time.       

1839
01:14:38,508 --> 01:14:40,942
            Thanks.             

1840
01:14:40,944 --> 01:14:44,378
      Yeah, whore,              
      how does that feel?       

1841
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:46,113
                               ¶

1842
01:14:46,115 --> 01:14:47,849
     It feels like the band     
     is back together.          

1843
01:14:47,851 --> 01:14:51,018
   Speaking of bands,           
   Jack's hair looks awesome.   

1844
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:52,920
      I just hope Bon Jovi      
      has good news             

1845
01:14:52,922 --> 01:14:55,957
   because we couldn't find     
   anywhere that was hiring.    

1846
01:14:55,959 --> 01:14:58,059
      And we're saving up       
      for a Kia.                

1847
01:14:58,061 --> 01:15:01,863
    That's a great vehicle.     

1848
01:15:01,865 --> 01:15:04,165
    Rachel, perfect timing.     

1849
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:09,070
 Wow, look who's brought        
 the Dumbbells uni, I like it.  

1850
01:15:09,072 --> 01:15:09,837
           Official.            

1851
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:11,172
   I gotta rally the troops.    

1852
01:15:11,174 --> 01:15:12,139
 I'll see you in a little bit,  
 okay?                          

1853
01:15:12,141 --> 01:15:14,575
           All right.           

1854
01:15:14,577 --> 01:15:15,510
              Wow.              

1855
01:15:15,512 --> 01:15:16,477
     Blonde is way better.      

1856
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:19,447
              Yes.              

1857
01:15:19,449 --> 01:15:20,581
              Hey.              

1858
01:15:20,583 --> 01:15:21,883
              Hey.              

1859
01:15:21,885 --> 01:15:23,784
     Thank you for coming.      

1860
01:15:23,786 --> 01:15:27,154
       I've gotta support       
       my uncle, right?         

1861
01:15:27,156 --> 01:15:27,822
             Right.             

1862
01:15:27,824 --> 01:15:30,191
      All right, everyone.      

1863
01:15:30,193 --> 01:15:32,994
      Let me just say uh,       
      it's fantastic            

1864
01:15:32,996 --> 01:15:34,996
      to see you all back       
      in uniform again.         

1865
01:15:34,998 --> 01:15:36,998
    I know we've had            
    some bumps in the road,     

1866
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,100
 but uh, I hope you enjoyed     
 that little vacation of yours  

1867
01:15:39,102 --> 01:15:40,635
   'cause that's all it was,    

1868
01:15:40,637 --> 01:15:42,670
  'cause it's time to get down  
  to some work.                 

1869
01:15:42,672 --> 01:15:45,373
That's right, it's time to turn 
the gym's business around       

1870
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:47,441
     and take back control      
     of our lives.              

1871
01:15:47,443 --> 01:15:50,578
  And that's why we've come up  
  with a three part plan.       

1872
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:54,482
         Todd, hand out         
         the binders.           

1873
01:15:54,484 --> 01:15:57,585
   Now when I escaped I knew    
   that I was gonna have to     

1874
01:15:57,587 --> 01:15:59,153
   face the Leader once more.   

1875
01:15:59,155 --> 01:16:00,821
          -Escaped?             
          -The Leader?          

1876
01:16:00,823 --> 01:16:01,856
         That's right.          

1877
01:16:01,858 --> 01:16:04,692
        I was in a cult         
        for 20 years.           

1878
01:16:04,694 --> 01:16:06,827
           Be strong.           

1879
01:16:06,829 --> 01:16:08,529
      But I'm not ashamed.      

1880
01:16:08,531 --> 01:16:10,031
  And I'm not hiding anymore.   

1881
01:16:10,033 --> 01:16:12,733
      In fact, not only         
      am I fighting back,       

1882
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:14,602
      but I am taking           
      those mind sucking,       

1883
01:16:14,604 --> 01:16:18,039
  alien loving parasites down   
  and I won't stop              

1884
01:16:18,041 --> 01:16:20,241
        until I retrieve        
        every penny             

1885
01:16:20,243 --> 01:16:24,745
    of my $5,994,000            
    that they still owe me.     

1886
01:16:24,747 --> 01:16:27,248
    They will be begging me     
    for mercy.                  

1887
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:29,617
      Across the universe       
      the name Jack Guy         

1888
01:16:29,619 --> 01:16:34,388
 will cause fear in the hearts  
 of every Octaurean.            

1889
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:35,590
             Bobby?             

1890
01:16:35,592 --> 01:16:37,858
   So you want us to help you   
   take down the cult           

1891
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:41,929
     to get your money back     
     to save this gym.          

1892
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:42,797
      No, no, not at all.       

1893
01:16:42,799 --> 01:16:44,432
      I was just venting.       

1894
01:16:44,434 --> 01:16:46,300
  It's a really important       
  part of the healing process.  

1895
01:16:46,302 --> 01:16:47,501
           My thera--           

1896
01:16:47,503 --> 01:16:48,903
           Um, guys.            

1897
01:16:48,905 --> 01:16:52,073
   I think what Jack            
   is trying to say is this.    

1898
01:16:52,075 --> 01:16:55,076
   After my injury I started    
   to act as if life            

1899
01:16:55,078 --> 01:16:57,712
   had robbed me of something   
   that I deserved.             

1900
01:16:57,714 --> 01:16:59,614
       That life owed me.       

1901
01:16:59,616 --> 01:17:02,350
           And I quit           
           on myself.           

1902
01:17:02,352 --> 01:17:03,884
     But I'm ready to           
     get back in the game.      

1903
01:17:03,886 --> 01:17:05,519
      I'm tired of sitting      
      on the sideline.          

1904
01:17:05,521 --> 01:17:08,155
     I wanna play some ball     
     and what I wanna know      

1905
01:17:08,157 --> 01:17:11,359
    is who is ready to play     
    some ball with me?          

1906
01:17:11,361 --> 01:17:12,660
             Bobby.             

1907
01:17:12,662 --> 01:17:17,665
   So, you want us to join      
   a basketball league, then?   

1908
01:17:17,667 --> 01:17:19,100
              No.               

1909
01:17:19,102 --> 01:17:22,203
   I think what Chris           
   and Jack are trying to say   

1910
01:17:22,205 --> 01:17:25,339
    is that if we               
    work together as a team     

1911
01:17:25,341 --> 01:17:27,642
     we can turn Dumbbells'     
     business around            

1912
01:17:27,644 --> 01:17:30,645
    and save everyone's job.    

1913
01:17:30,647 --> 01:17:32,747
              Oh.               

1914
01:17:32,749 --> 01:17:34,115
    I thought we were clear.    

1915
01:17:34,117 --> 01:17:35,383
      So here's the plan.       

1916
01:17:35,385 --> 01:17:36,951
     With the money we got      
     from the cult,             

1917
01:17:36,953 --> 01:17:38,619
      we'll throw               
      a promotional party.      

1918
01:17:38,621 --> 01:17:40,021
    But not just any party.     

1919
01:17:40,023 --> 01:17:45,292
     I'm talking a full on      
     Hollywood event.           

1920
01:17:45,294 --> 01:17:48,295
    When times are tough,       
    families pull together.     

1921
01:17:48,297 --> 01:17:52,566
   And say goodbye to working   
   for minimum wage.            

1922
01:17:52,568 --> 01:17:53,901
         That's right.          

1923
01:17:53,903 --> 01:17:57,004
    From now on everyone has    
    a piece of the company.     

1924
01:17:57,006 --> 01:17:58,305
         We are a team,         

1925
01:17:58,307 --> 01:18:00,174
       and there's no "I"       
       in "Dumbbells".          

1926
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:02,877
      ¶ And I just can't        
      wait till the day ¶       

1927
01:18:02,879 --> 01:18:05,780
 ¶ When you knock on my door    

1928
01:18:05,782 --> 01:18:08,683
                               ¶

1929
01:18:08,685 --> 01:18:12,119
     ¶ Now every time           
     I go for the mailbox ¶     

1930
01:18:12,121 --> 01:18:14,455
   ¶ Gotta hold myself down     

1931
01:18:14,457 --> 01:18:17,458
                               ¶

1932
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:20,294
   ¶ 'Cause I just can't wait   
   till you write me ¶          

1933
01:18:20,296 --> 01:18:25,166
    ¶ You're coming around      

1934
01:18:25,168 --> 01:18:29,437
   ¶ I'm walking on sunshine,   
   wooah ¶                      

1935
01:18:29,439 --> 01:18:33,941
   ¶ I'm walking on sunshine,   
   woooah ¶                     

1936
01:18:33,943 --> 01:18:35,342
   ¶ I'm walking on sunshine,   
   woooah ¶                     

1937
01:18:35,344 --> 01:18:39,046
     For every problem,         
     we crate the solution.     

1938
01:18:39,048 --> 01:18:41,082
    Even the bitchiest ones.    

1939
01:18:41,084 --> 01:18:42,483
        [engine revving]        

1940
01:18:42,485 --> 01:18:48,355
                               ¶

1941
01:18:48,357 --> 01:18:51,292
      ¶ I used to think         
      maybe you love me ¶       

1942
01:18:51,294 --> 01:18:56,130
        ¶ Now I know            
        that it's true ¶        

1943
01:18:56,132 --> 01:18:59,366
     Turns out Fabio's          
     not a dick after all.      

1944
01:18:59,368 --> 01:19:00,267
         Good evening.          

1945
01:19:00,269 --> 01:19:02,470
     I'm looking for Ivana.     

1946
01:19:02,472 --> 01:19:04,505
        I'm, I'm Ivana.         

1947
01:19:04,507 --> 01:19:05,606
              Wow.              

1948
01:19:05,608 --> 01:19:07,541
     I didn't know you were     
     that beautiful             

1949
01:19:07,543 --> 01:19:09,310
          and so sexy.          

1950
01:19:09,312 --> 01:19:10,478
              Oh.               

1951
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:16,016
    Would you like to go for    
    an evening ride?            

1952
01:19:16,018 --> 01:19:18,018
           Let's go.            

1953
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:19,587
    Once he heard that Jack     
    got screwed                 

1954
01:19:19,589 --> 01:19:20,688
     out of all his money,      

1955
01:19:20,690 --> 01:19:26,794
  he stepped up to the plate,   
  big time.                     

1956
01:19:26,796 --> 01:19:28,295
     Let me help with that.     

1957
01:19:28,297 --> 01:19:33,367
   Oh yeah if you could         
   just get that right there.   

1958
01:19:33,369 --> 01:19:34,468
            Perfect.            

1959
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:36,971
            Perfect.            

1960
01:19:36,973 --> 01:19:39,373
             Guys!              

1961
01:19:39,375 --> 01:19:41,142
   Oh, my God, are you okay?    

1962
01:19:41,144 --> 01:19:44,111
  Shouldn't be on that ladder   
  at the same time.             

1963
01:19:44,113 --> 01:19:45,846
       See that big game        
       last night?              

1964
01:19:45,848 --> 01:19:52,920

1973
01:20:42,205 --> 01:20:43,771
    Hey, buddy, you made it.    

1974
01:20:43,773 --> 01:20:45,039
   How you doing, my friend?    

1975
01:20:45,041 --> 01:20:45,940
       Great to see you.        

1976
01:20:45,942 --> 01:20:47,308
              Hey.              

1977
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:49,710
     Any bats in the cave?      

1978
01:20:49,712 --> 01:20:51,111
         You're clear.          

1979
01:20:51,113 --> 01:20:52,112
         Thanks, buddy.         

1980
01:20:52,114 --> 01:20:53,447
        You know, Chris.        

1981
01:20:53,449 --> 01:20:55,416
   I'm really glad you and I    
   teamed up.                   

1982
01:20:55,418 --> 01:20:57,184
  It's like when Apollo Creed   
  and Rocky joined forces       

1983
01:20:57,186 --> 01:20:58,786
    to take on The Russian.     

1984
01:20:58,788 --> 01:21:00,521
   The Russian killed Apollo.   

1985
01:21:00,523 --> 01:21:03,257
  You better revert back        
  to your negativity, dipshit.  

1986
01:21:03,259 --> 01:21:05,459
  Holy "Valkyrie" on Blu-ray,   
  is that Tom Cruise?           

1987
01:21:05,461 --> 01:21:07,661
       Sometimes you just       
       gotta say                

1988
01:21:07,663 --> 01:21:09,063
         what the fuck.         

1989
01:21:09,065 --> 01:21:09,930
        Make your move.         

1990
01:21:09,932 --> 01:21:11,966
           Woo, woo!            

1991
01:21:11,968 --> 01:21:14,768
  No, that is not Tom Cruise.   

1992
01:21:14,770 --> 01:21:16,237
      That is Tom Cruise.       

1993
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:17,204
        You complete me.        

1994
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:18,472
        You complete me.        

1995
01:21:18,474 --> 01:21:19,974
       I was a bartender        
       in the Philippines       

1996
01:21:19,976 --> 01:21:21,342
   and I watched "Cocktail"     
   every day for inspiration.   

1997
01:21:21,344 --> 01:21:22,676
      That is Tom Cruise.       

1998
01:21:22,678 --> 01:21:24,712
      You were a bartender      
      in the Philippines?       

1999
01:21:24,714 --> 01:21:25,613
             Sure.              

2000
01:21:25,615 --> 01:21:27,815
  Actually, it doesn't matter.  

2001
01:21:27,817 --> 01:21:29,516
     Perception is reality.     

2002
01:21:29,518 --> 01:21:30,851
     Hey, guys, a real live     
     Hollywood producer         

2003
01:21:30,853 --> 01:21:32,353
     just gave me his card.     

2004
01:21:32,355 --> 01:21:35,456
   Said I had a dynamic look,   
   wants to make me a star.     

2005
01:21:35,458 --> 01:21:36,523
            Awesome.            

2006
01:21:36,525 --> 01:21:38,525
        Congrats, buddy.        

2007
01:21:38,527 --> 01:21:41,829
    He reminds me of a young    
    Macaulay Culkin.            

2008
01:21:41,831 --> 01:21:49,670
                               ¶

2009
01:21:49,672 --> 01:21:51,739
   It's kinda crazy to think    
   that I wanted to quit        

2010
01:21:51,741 --> 01:21:53,474
   not even a month ago, huh?   

2011
01:21:53,476 --> 01:21:55,743
    Well, we all wanna quit     
    at one time or another.     

2012
01:21:55,745 --> 01:21:57,278
       Important thing is       
       to hang in there         

2013
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:00,214
    because tomorrow always     
    brings another surprise.    

2014
01:22:00,216 --> 01:22:03,584
     Speaking of surprises,     
     I got this for ya.         

2015
01:22:03,586 --> 01:22:04,285
             Boom.              

2016
01:22:04,287 --> 01:22:05,452
          What's this?          

2017
01:22:05,454 --> 01:22:06,887
     I was able to salvage      
     the footage                

2018
01:22:06,889 --> 01:22:08,355
     from the reality show.     

2019
01:22:08,357 --> 01:22:10,591
     I edited it together,      
     added effects,             

2020
01:22:10,593 --> 01:22:13,527
  cool transitions, graphics,   
  the whole nine.               

2021
01:22:13,529 --> 01:22:16,196
      Wow, how'd you learn      
      to do that?               

2022
01:22:16,198 --> 01:22:19,133
      I was an art major.       

2023
01:22:19,135 --> 01:22:20,768
     How's it going, guys?      

2024

2026
01:22:25,241 --> 01:22:26,140
   It's Slutsville out there.   

2027
01:22:26,142 --> 01:22:27,608
     Is that a real place?      

2028
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:29,176
      'Cause if it's not        
      I would move there.       

2029
01:22:29,178 --> 01:22:31,111
  Hey, you guys were the guys   
  from the bank.                

2030
01:22:31,113 --> 01:22:32,446
     Oh, my God, the loan.      

2031
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:33,948
             Yeah.              

2032
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:36,183
  Look, please accept           
  my deepest apologies, okay?   

2033
01:22:36,185 --> 01:22:37,618
       I really am sorry,       

2034
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:39,320
     I'm just going through     
     some shit right now.       

2035
01:22:39,322 --> 01:22:40,387
My kid's masturbating at school,
can't stop him,                 

2036
01:22:40,389 --> 01:22:41,522
      how do you stop him?      

2037
01:22:41,524 --> 01:22:43,324
        His dick's there        
        all the time.           

2038
01:22:43,326 --> 01:22:44,792
    All right, I'm not gonna    
    bother with my hands.       

2039
01:22:44,794 --> 01:22:49,563
    They're gonna get dirty     
    in a second anyway.         

2040
01:22:49,565 --> 01:22:52,800
  Did you know we already have  
  42 new members?               

2041
01:22:52,802 --> 01:22:54,401
        Are any of them         
        rich men?               

2042
01:22:54,403 --> 01:22:57,671
   Crystal, don't be a slut.    

2043
01:22:57,673 --> 01:22:59,773

    pretty good right now,

01:23:01,010 --> 01:23:03,344
 You guys did a really good job 
 with this place.               

2046
01:23:03,346 --> 01:23:04,945
    My dad couldn't do this.    

2047
01:23:04,947 --> 01:23:09,650
        He said I suck,         
        he sucks.               

2048
01:23:09,652 --> 01:23:12,920
  Chris, Jack told me you have  
  a sweat problem.              

2049
01:23:12,922 --> 01:23:14,254
     I think this can help.     

2050
01:23:14,256 --> 01:23:16,757

       I'd say this, but,

01:26:13,402 --> 01:26:15,469
  ¶ I ain't feelin' no pain     

2122
01:26:15,471 --> 01:26:19,673
 ¶ Batter's up swingin' hard    
 'cause I'm still in the game ¶ 

2123
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:22,309
¶ I still got it, still got it, 
still got it ¶                  

2124
01:26:22,311 --> 01:26:23,777
           Hey, Jack.           

2125
01:26:23,779 --> 01:26:25,946
        Bumbaloo,               
        nice to see ya.         

2126
01:26:25,948 --> 01:26:27,047
           Hey, Jack.           

2127
01:26:27,049 --> 01:26:28,815
     Fabio told us you were     
     having a party.            

2128
01:26:28,817 --> 01:26:30,450
      Yup, you guys having      
      some fun, huh?            

2129
01:26:30,452 --> 01:26:32,886
    Yeah, but unfortunately     
    we're in a big rush.        

2130
01:26:32,888 --> 01:26:35,122
 Our helicopter's picking us up 
 in five.                       

2131
01:26:35,124 --> 01:26:36,156
           Oh, okay.            

2132
01:26:36,158 --> 01:26:37,357
       Is this roof flat?       

2133
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:38,292
           Uh, yeah.            

2134
01:26:38,294 --> 01:26:39,693
       It doesn't matter.       

2135
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:41,395
   Look, we're branching out    
   of Las Vegas,                

2136
01:26:41,397 --> 01:26:42,963
      we're producing           
      our own television,       

2137
01:26:42,965 --> 01:26:44,531
     and we were looking at     
     the footage over here      

2138
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:45,732
      and thought that...       

2139
01:26:45,734 --> 01:26:47,701
       Premise rocks,           
       we love the name,        

2140
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:50,103
     and that's some            
     fine ass bitches here.     

2141
01:26:50,105 --> 01:26:51,805
     It's like "Sunset Tan"     
     in a gym                   

2142
01:26:51,807 --> 01:26:53,574
    and not only could it be    
    a reality show,             

2143
01:26:53,576 --> 01:26:55,209
        but maybe we can        
        franchise this.         

2144
01:26:55,211 --> 01:26:57,811
   Let's talk on Monday,        
   we'll discuss the numbers.   

2145
01:26:57,813 --> 01:27:01,014
          Absolutely.           

2146
01:27:01,016 --> 01:27:03,050
          Okay, Jack.           

2147
01:27:03,052 --> 01:27:04,785
       Come on, bitches.        

2148
01:27:04,787 --> 01:27:06,520
      We don't wanna keep       
      Obama waiting.            

2149
01:27:06,522 --> 01:27:08,989
   No, you definitely do not.   

2150
01:27:08,991 --> 01:27:14,027
                               ¶

2151
01:27:14,029 --> 01:27:17,798
    Dumbbells, Dumbbells,       
    Dumbbells, Dumbbells...     

2152
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:20,133
    So I guess the vision       
    doesn't always manifest     

2153
01:27:20,135 --> 01:27:22,302
     exactly as you see it.     

2154
01:27:22,304 --> 01:27:24,371
  But Jack Guy sure was right.  

2155
01:27:24,373 --> 01:27:26,240
      Dreams do come true.      

2156
01:27:26,242 --> 01:27:30,777
                               ¶

2157
01:27:30,779 --> 01:27:32,079
     Oh, everything's gonna     
     be fine?                   

2158
01:27:32,081 --> 01:27:33,714
       Everything's gonna       
       be fine?                 

2159
01:27:33,716 --> 01:27:34,248
            Listen.             

2160
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:35,649
        Do I look fine?         

2161
01:27:35,651 --> 01:27:37,317
         I am not fine.         

2162
01:27:37,319 --> 01:27:40,087
    I am very far from fine.    

2163
01:27:40,089 --> 01:27:42,022
       Take off that wig!       

2164
01:27:42,024 --> 01:27:46,793
           Goddammit!           

2165
01:27:46,795 --> 01:27:48,328
             Um...              

2166
01:27:48,330 --> 01:27:50,731
             Sorry.             

2167
01:27:50,733 --> 01:27:52,332
     How's the date going?      

2168
01:27:52,334 --> 01:27:53,834
       It is not a date.        

2169
01:27:53,836 --> 01:27:55,535
       Looks like a date        
       from over here.          

2170
01:27:55,537 --> 01:27:56,670
       It is not a date.        

2171
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:59,406
         Just tell her          
         how you feel.          

2172
01:27:59,408 --> 01:28:03,510
        What the fuck           
        is your problem?        

2173
01:28:03,512 --> 01:28:05,245
      So what's your sign?      

2174
01:28:05,247 --> 01:28:09,049
  You wanna go out after this,  
  get a penis colada?           

2175
01:28:09,051 --> 01:28:11,184
      I mean, pina colada.      

2176
01:28:11,186 --> 01:28:13,153
     You know what I meant.     

2177
01:28:13,155 --> 01:28:15,756
              Cut.              

2178
01:28:15,758 --> 01:28:17,324
      Hey, guys,                
      how's it going, huh?      

2179
01:28:17,326 --> 01:28:18,325
     How about this party?      

2180
01:28:18,327 --> 01:28:19,860
        Oh, my God,             
        I swear to God,         

2181
01:28:19,862 --> 01:28:22,129
50% of those chicks can fit     
their full fist in their mouth. 

2182
01:28:22,131 --> 01:28:24,164
    Sucks that one couldn't     
    get it back out,            

2183
01:28:24,166 --> 01:28:25,198
    but she's gonna be okay.    

2184
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:26,233
           And, mark.           

2185
01:28:26,235 --> 01:28:27,668
        It was a bad day        
        for me, okay?           

2186
01:28:27,670 --> 01:28:30,103
   My dad's in town right now   
   and, you know,               

2187
01:28:30,105 --> 01:28:30,904
       he was a drinker.        

2188
01:28:30,906 --> 01:28:32,039
  He was a drinker growing up   

2189
01:28:32,041 --> 01:28:33,840
    and projectile vomiting,    
    constantly.                 

2190
01:28:33,842 --> 01:28:35,242
      You know he actually      
      threw up once             

2191
01:28:35,244 --> 01:28:37,277
   while he was changing me,    
   right on my dick.            

2192
01:28:37,279 --> 01:28:39,446
    You remember that shit.     

2193
01:28:39,448 --> 01:28:41,148
      And do either of you      
      have a roofie?            

2194
01:28:41,150 --> 01:28:43,283
   The big blonde, seriously,   
   one or two?                  

2195
01:28:43,285 --> 01:28:44,217
           I say two.           

2196
01:28:44,219 --> 01:28:47,654
           Bets, huh?           

2197
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:51,358
   Sorry, I seriously can't.    

2198
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:54,561
           [laughing]           

2199
01:28:54,563 --> 01:28:56,430
             Sorry.             

2200
01:28:56,432 --> 01:28:57,664
              Why?              

2201
01:28:57,666 --> 01:29:00,634
      Why, why, why, why,       
      why, why, why?            

2202
01:29:00,636 --> 01:29:06,573
     Tell me why, why, why,     
     why, why, why, why.        

2203
01:29:06,575 --> 01:29:08,642
      I'm up to 104 views.      

2204
01:29:08,644 --> 01:29:10,777
     That dramatic chipmunk     
     better watch out.          

2205
01:29:10,779 --> 01:29:12,279
   I'm gonna give it my nuts.   

2206
01:29:12,281 --> 01:29:14,114
   That little kid that said,   
   "Charlie bit my finger"      

2207
01:29:14,116 --> 01:29:16,350
 better watch out before I put  
 him in a fucking microwave.    

2208
01:29:16,352 --> 01:29:18,552
  That sneezing panda better    
  watch its multicolored back   

2209
01:29:18,554 --> 01:29:20,253
     before I fist fuck it      
     with my nine.              

2210
01:29:20,255 --> 01:29:22,923
 Again, thanks for stopping by, 
 you have my card?              

2211
01:29:22,925 --> 01:29:24,224
             Yeah?              

2212
01:29:24,226 --> 01:29:26,126
I mean, I ripped the number off 
so you can't call me.           

2213
01:29:26,128 --> 01:29:27,327
        That Starbucks?         

2214
01:29:27,329 --> 01:29:29,629
 You know,                      
 there's cheaper coffee, 7-11.  

2215
01:29:29,631 --> 01:29:31,031
      I'm a banker, okay?       

2216
01:29:31,033 --> 01:29:32,399
        I'm dead inside.        

2217
01:29:32,401 --> 01:29:34,234
        Smoked some more        
        of that kush.           

2218
01:29:34,236 --> 01:29:37,137
 I got so ripped I watched five 
 seasons of "Lost" in one day.  

2219
01:29:37,139 --> 01:29:39,406
    Yeah, that's impossible,    
    homey.                      

2220
01:29:39,408 --> 01:29:41,274
    That's, like, 80 hours.     

2221
01:29:41,276 --> 01:29:42,542
          In one day.           

2222
01:29:42,544 --> 01:29:43,510
   Look, I got a show to do.    

2223
01:29:43,512 --> 01:29:45,645
       [speaking French]        

2224
01:29:45,647 --> 01:29:46,747
   No, my ass is on the line.   

2225
01:29:46,749 --> 01:29:48,215
     You're working for me!     

2226
01:29:48,217 --> 01:29:51,551
  You know, you've got the IQ   
  of a croissant!               

2227
01:29:51,553 --> 01:29:52,652
  You know, I don't need this.  

2228
01:29:52,654 --> 01:29:56,189
       [speaking French]        

2229
01:29:56,191 --> 01:30:00,627
              Ew.               

2230
01:30:00,629 --> 01:30:02,629
  Okay, go back to kissing me.  

2231
01:30:02,631 --> 01:30:03,597
              Cut.              

2232
01:30:03,599 --> 01:30:05,098
        People love that        
        you know.               

2233
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:06,533
     It's like, nobody fuck     
     with the Fabio, okay?      

2234
01:30:06,535 --> 01:30:09,302
        Have a good day.        

2235
01:30:09,304 --> 01:30:13,073
           [laughing]           

2236
01:30:13,075 --> 01:30:13,573
            Thanks.             

2237
01:30:13,575 --> 01:30:14,775
           "Titanic".           

2238
01:30:14,777 --> 01:30:16,410
    You still owe me            
    "Sleepless In Seattle".     

2239
01:30:16,412 --> 01:30:18,178
  I'm not done with it, Chris!  

2240
01:30:18,180 --> 01:30:19,413
           Whatever!            

2241
01:30:19,415 --> 01:30:20,313
        You're whatever!        

2242
01:30:20,315 --> 01:30:21,314
        You're whatever!        

2243
01:30:21,316 --> 01:30:21,982
            You are!            

2244
01:30:21,984 --> 01:30:24,518
            You are!            

2245
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:26,119
       He's not a dimwit.       

2246
01:30:26,121 --> 01:30:29,022
     You have to have a wit     
     to be dim.                 

2247
01:30:29,024 --> 01:30:31,658
        He's the dimmest        
        of the dimwits.         

2248
01:30:31,660 --> 01:30:33,026
          Mr. Dimwit.           

2249
01:30:33,028 --> 01:30:35,195
          Mr. Dimwit.           

2250
01:30:35,197 --> 01:30:37,297
        Captain Dimwit.         

2251
01:30:37,299 --> 01:30:38,732
        General Dimwit.         

2252
01:30:38,734 --> 01:30:41,067
          King Dimwit.          

2253
01:30:41,069 --> 01:30:43,036
        Emperor Dimwit.         

2254
01:30:43,038 --> 01:30:44,571
              Yes.              

2255
01:30:44,573 --> 01:30:47,040
              Cut!              

2256
01:30:47,042 --> 01:30:49,276
  Listen, Dances With Queers,   
  I'm never fucking done.       

2257
01:30:49,278 --> 01:30:51,778
   I got 20 more laps           
   and an hour worth of legs    

2258
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:54,147
and I'm gonna fuck this line up 
horribly.                       

2259
01:30:54,149 --> 01:30:55,849
           [barking]            

2260
01:30:55,851 --> 01:31:04,224
                               ¶

2261
01:31:04,226 --> 01:31:07,427
      Okay, le-,                
      let's cut the crap!       

2262
01:31:07,429 --> 01:31:08,662
   See this coat I'm wearing?   

2263
01:31:08,664 --> 01:31:09,896
    I don't need it anymore,    
    you know why?               

2264
01:31:09,898 --> 01:31:11,498
       Because I'm cooked       
       and failing              

2265
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:12,632
 I had two slices of bad pizza  

2266
01:31:12,634 --> 01:31:14,968
    and I'm already throwing    
    punches.                    

2267
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:16,369
       Are you out of           
       your fucking mind?       

2268
01:31:16,371 --> 01:31:18,305
     I don't put that shit      
     in my body.                

2269
01:31:18,307 --> 01:31:19,539
     I'm downing some COC.      

2270
01:31:19,541 --> 01:31:21,441
   Cellular Oxygen Creatine.    

2271
01:31:21,443 --> 01:31:22,809
        A liquid formula        
        that quadruples         

2272
01:31:22,811 --> 01:31:24,878
    my amino acid recovery      
    by fucking up the lines     

2273
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,646
      and having to do it       
      over ago.                 

2274
01:31:26,648 --> 01:31:27,981
     I'm downing some COC.      

2275
01:31:27,983 --> 01:31:31,284
    Creatine Oxygen fucking     
    shit backwards asshole.     

2276
01:31:31,286 --> 01:31:33,787
 Cellular Oxygen Creatine,      
 a liquid formula that triples  

2277
01:31:33,789 --> 01:31:37,257
   my amino acid circulation    
   while quadrupling...         

2278
01:31:37,259 --> 01:31:39,159
     Goat got your tongue?      

2279
01:31:39,161 --> 01:31:41,428
 The "baa" is my favorite part. 

2280
01:31:41,430 --> 01:31:45,732
         [goat bleats]          

2281
01:31:45,734 --> 01:31:46,700
         This was fun.          

2282
01:31:46,702 --> 01:31:47,601
        Wasn't this fun?        

2283
01:31:47,603 --> 01:31:49,369
    We should do this again.    

2284
01:31:49,371 --> 01:31:52,706
     ¶ I'm gone, I'm gone,      
     I'm gone, I'm gone ¶       

2285
01:31:52,708 --> 01:31:55,775
     ¶ I'm gone, I'm gone       

2286
01:31:55,777 --> 01:31:57,410
     ¶ Gonna light it up        

2287
01:31:57,412 --> 01:31:59,145
         ¶ Tore it up           

2288
01:31:59,147 --> 01:32:00,447
        ¶ That's enough         

2289
01:32:00,449 --> 01:32:03,850
      ¶ I'm gone, I'm gone      
      I'm gone, I'm gone ¶
