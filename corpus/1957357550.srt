1
00:00:14,712 --> 00:00:15,707
Hello?

2
00:00:15,727 --> 00:00:19,120
Hi, Troy, I heard you were
having a party tomorrow night.

3
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,670
Where'd you hear that?

4
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,323
Oh, you know, I have my ways.

5
00:00:23,583 --> 00:00:24,740
Uh.

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,040
Well, are you gonna invite us,

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,380
or are you gonna leave us hanging?

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,214
Us?

9
00:00:28,234 --> 00:00:32,001
You know, the girls,
silly, Cameron and Sandra.

10
00:00:32,855 --> 00:00:34,010
Unless you don't want us to.

11
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,510
I mean, if you think it might bother Tonya.

12
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,763
No, um, I want you to come.

13
00:00:38,783 --> 00:00:42,923
Good, maybe we can
find a little quiet time.

14
00:00:43,811 --> 00:00:46,597
You know, get away from the
group, et cetera,

15
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,820
because I have something that
I've been wanting to tell you.

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,586
Something you wanna tell me?

17
00:00:52,606 --> 00:00:55,410
Bye, Troy.

18
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,660
Oh my God.

19
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,230
Nice one, Beck.

20
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,510
I am totally dragging you to
try out for the spring play.

21
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,890
Mr. Blackmore would love you.

22
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,690
Oh, memorizing lines
aren't really my thing.

23
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,340
I just like, like, make
up stuff on the fly.

24
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,070
It's more exciting that way.

25
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,113
Troy is having a minor
heart attack right now.

26
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,420
I know, right, he's going,

27
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,873
uh, something, uh, something
you have to tell me?

28
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,133
Yeah, maybe I'd like to show him something.

29
00:01:25,153 --> 00:01:29,486
Shame, shame.

30
00:01:39,606 --> 00:01:44,606
Okay, so, we have
Troy's party tomorrow night,

31
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,983
but what're we gonna do with our Saturday?

32
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,740
Any ideas?

33
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,935
I thought I heard something.

34
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,200
Maybe Troy and his buddies are coming over

35
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,440
to try and sneak a peak.

36
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,420
Oh, please, Beck just called him at home

37
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,920
like 30 seconds ago.

38
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,523
It was like a, like a crunching.

39
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,990
I'm serious!

40
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,873
Oh relax, they'd have
to get past the main house

41
00:02:19,893 --> 00:02:21,700
just to get back here.

42
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,660
Past my all seeing parents.

43
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,280
They'd have to be pretty sneaky.

44
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,173
Something adventurous.

45
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,873
We could explore The Morgantown woods.

46
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,070
See if the rumors are true.

47
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,470
That I like.

48
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,970
We could go undercover.

49
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,150
I can dress like the Ninja.

50
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,973
The Ninja is so lame.

51
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:54,180
We'd be like a team of female assassins.

52
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,830
Nice, I've got a bunch
of old clothes out here,

53
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,873
like black hood sweatshirts and stuff.

54
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:17,620
Rise and shine, Freaky Farley.

55
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,673
You've got a visitor coming in today.

56
00:04:24,153 --> 00:04:26,733
Farley, my name is Dr. Timson.

57
00:04:30,753 --> 00:04:34,060
I'm one of the most respected
doctors in the region.

58
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,130
Are you married?

59
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,340
Oh, yes, I am, but I don't
believe that's any of your...

60
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,030
May I call you Mrs. Timson?

61
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,333
I would prefer Dr. Timson.

62
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,513
I like Mrs. Timson.

63
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,260
Oh, I suppose that is acceptable.

64
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,460
Thank you, Mrs. Timson

65
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,920
Do you know why I'm here?

66
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,180
Same reason all the other

67
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,350
so called doctors have been here.

68
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,946
And why is that?

69
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:04,566
Because you wanna find
out how my sick mind works.

70
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,830
I suppose you could
put it that way, Farley.

71
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,593
That's right, Mrs. Timson.

72
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,830
I happen to think I'm
here to help you, Farley.

73
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:20,314
To find a way to channel your
anger in a more healthful way.

74
00:05:20,334 --> 00:05:23,530
Blahty, blah, blah, blah.

75
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,850
Listen, Farley, you can
cooperate with me or not,

76
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,450
but it's in your best
interest to cooperate.

77
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,451
It's not like they'll ever

78
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:34,790
let me out of this place, Mrs. Timson.

79
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,190
I've done terrible things,
terrible, terrible things.

80
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,240
Aren't you familiar with my case?

81
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,690
Don't you know what I'm capable of?

82
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,600
I am familiar with your case, Farley,

83
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,270
but I'd like to hear it all from you.

84
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,720
Are you willing to do that for me?

85
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,663
I suppose so, Mrs. Timson.

86
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,710
After all, there's nothing else
for me to do in this, this.

87
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,730
Place?

88
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,820
That's right, but in the future,

89
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,750
allow me to finish my own sentences.

90
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:09,770
Fine, I'll be recording this, Farley.

91
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,320
Do you mind?

92
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,503
Please do.

93
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,980
Why don't we start with
the death of your mother.

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,780
You'll never replace her!

95
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,613
You get ahold of yourself, young man!

96
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,890
I'm not a young man, Mrs. Timson.

97
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,123
I'm old, very old.

98
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,263
Well, maybe not yet,

99
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,973
but where I am now is where
I'll be when I'm very old.

100
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,360
I wasn't very old when Mom died though.

101
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,363
I was just a boy.

102
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,020
Think of that, Mrs. Timson.

103
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,550
For a young boy to lose his mother.

104
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:58,280
That's not the way it's suppose to happen.

105
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,540
I remember she had gone away the day before

106
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,150
to do some work on our family cabin.

107
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,720
I thought I'd wake up that morning,

108
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,870
and see that she'd returned.

109
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:10,150
Instead, it was my dad who woke me up.

110
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,260
He didn't say anything at first.

111
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,000
He just put his hand on my shoulder.

112
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,080
That was the last time

113
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,263
my father showed me any
kind of understanding.

114
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,323
The next day I spilled some milk.

115
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,580
Farley, how could you!

116
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,860
Look at this mess that you made!

117
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,013
Now, help me clean it up
before your mother comes home.

118
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,810
You know how they say

119
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,150
you shouldn't cry over spilled milk?

120
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,763
You've made a terrible mess.

121
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:43,050
Now, go out back and
wait for your punishment.

122
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,620
Well, I ended up
crying quite a bit that day,

123
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,730
but it wasn't because of the milk.

124
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,673
It was the way he punished me for it.

125
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,720
It's not about the milk, son.

126
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,883
It's the principal.

127
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,983
You've got to stop being
so dreamy, so careless.

128
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,083
Sure, you may not be the
brightest kid in your school.

129
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,410
You may not be the best
on your baseball team.

130
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,103
If only you weren't so afraid of the ball,

131
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,923
but we'll toughen you up yet.

132
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,080
Dig me a hole about four feet
wide and about four feet deep.

133
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,390
Well, what's it for?

134
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,373
Absolutely nothing, that's the point.

135
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,850
And another thing.

136
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,640
Would you change that shirt?

137
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,560
You've been wearing it for a week now.

138
00:09:21,355 --> 00:09:22,397
I don't think so, Dad.

139
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:23,980
The shirt stays.

140
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,090
It seems like so much of my
childhood was spent at the hole.

141
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,870
Digging it out, filling it in,

142
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,400
and sometimes while I was digging,

143
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,960
Dad would stand over me giving advice

144
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,690
on how to live my life.

145
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,070
And that's the thing about women.

146
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:44,280
I've seen those girls in your
class, heartbreakers I bet.

147
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,253
Probably best to stay away from them.

148
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,900
Okay, son.

149
00:09:57,245 --> 00:09:59,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa, where you going?

150
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:03,253
I need you to fill the hole
in, then come in for dinner.

151
00:10:22,362 --> 00:10:24,855
Well, what do we have here?

152
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,125
I hit a rock.

153
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,290
What're you gonna do about it?

154
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,740
I guess I'm gonna have to pick it out,

155
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,860
and then keep digging.

156
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,950
Well, when you get four feet,

157
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,290
why don't you give me a holler,

158
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,653
and I'll come out and measure it,

159
00:10:42,823 --> 00:10:44,520
then you can fill her in.

160
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,540
Yes, sir.

161
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,150
That's how things were,

162
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,130
overly strict rules, perverse punishments,

163
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,930
never catching a break.

164
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,842
I got used to it.

165
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,280
Son, these came for you in the mail.

166
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,531
Well, I was thinking maybe

167
00:11:45,551 --> 00:11:47,770
I could just take a couple of courses.

168
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,130
Son, what did we say about this?

169
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,860
You're too old for college.

170
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,600
You missed your chance.

171
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,240
Besides, who's gonna pay for this?

172
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,960
You don't even have a penny saved.

173
00:12:00,346 --> 00:12:01,390
But, Dad, if you just.

174
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:04,620
Son, the answer's no.

175
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,360
You'll stay here until
I can find you a job,

176
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,870
a practical job,

177
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,483
and you'll happily take it.

178
00:13:08,235 --> 00:13:10,410
Whoa, whoa, watch where
you're going, buddy.

179
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,244
Sorry.

180
00:13:11,264 --> 00:13:12,740
Sorry is not gonna cut it.

181
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,870
No, I think the situation
calls for something more.

182
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:16,781
Maybe you should get back here,

183
00:13:16,801 --> 00:13:18,920
and buy Betty and I a slice of pie.

184
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,310
That'll ease things over.

185
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,660
Help to subdue our feelings of rage.

186
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,641
I don't have any money.

187
00:13:23,661 --> 00:13:25,000
Then I suggest you run,

188
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,981
and don't come this way,

189
00:13:26,001 --> 00:13:28,653
till you're ready to make
reparations to Air Force Ricky.

190
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,743
Hey, Freaky Farley.

191
00:13:39,677 --> 00:13:42,094
Freaky Farley, Freaky Farley,

192
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,533
Freaky Farley, Freaky Farley, mm, mm.

193
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:02,309
Farley, come in here, please.

194
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,910
Come inside, son.

195
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,613
Time to discuss your future.

196
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,653
So, tell me how the job search is going.

197
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,363
No leads yet, Dad.

198
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,530
That's bad, Farley.

199
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,653
That's very bad.

200
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,190
Son, did you listen to my show last night?

201
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,240
Of course I did.

202
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,280
Well, apparently you
didn't listen too well.

203
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:35,690
What with an 86 on this morning's quiz.

204
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:38,553
Well, I guess my mind might've
been drifting a little bit.

205
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,630
Anyways, we discussed the importance

206
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,960
of persistence in job hunting.

207
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,600
Business leaders are so busy today, son,

208
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,700
that they don't have
time to give some nobody

209
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,780
a call back looking for a job.

210
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,480
That nobody needs to keep on calling.

211
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,390
Show up unannounced.

212
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:01,280
Always be around until gosh darn it,

213
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,990
the businessman has no choice
but to offer him the job.

214
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,920
Do you know what I mean, son?

215
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,100
Yes, Dad, although I wouldn't

216
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,120
say it really help me get
a job at the radio station.

217
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,080
What do you mean by that?

218
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,140
I'm the son of the most popular personality

219
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,360
at the station,

220
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,490
and I still didn't get the position.

221
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,330
I had nothing to do with that.

222
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:25,210
President Tarkington selected
Katie fair and square.

223
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,763
Besides, I tend to stay
out of office politics.

224
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,060
Katie's much more suited

225
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,310
for that line of work than you are, son.

226
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,793
Thanks a lot, Dad.

227
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,613
But I do have something lined up for you.

228
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,060
I understand it wasn't easy for you

229
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,200
to get me this opportunity,

230
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,830
but what is it?

231
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,400
Well, it's quite an
opportunity for any young man

232
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,743
with the drive to succeed.

233
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:54,810
But what is it?

234
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,440
Well, you remember Mrs. Green, right?

235
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,590
No.

236
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:02,200
Well, anyway, she's in charge of personnel

237
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,990
down there at the phone company.

238
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,010
You have an interview with
her Thursday at two o'clock.

239
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,900
What I need for you to do
today is go to the library,

240
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,050
and look up as much as you
can about the phone industry.

241
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,800
You have got to go into that interview

242
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,760
armed with information.

243
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:20,820
You know, telecommunications
is a fascinating field, son.

244
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,811
I mean just think about it.

245
00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:23,400
Thanks to the telephone,

246
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,850
I can call my friend, Harvey, in Seattle,

247
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,540
and talk to him as if he's
right here in the room with me.

248
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,020
But Dad, I don't even want an office job.

249
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,093
You know what I really wanna do...

250
00:16:32,113 --> 00:16:35,310
Son, would you get your
head out of the clouds?

251
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:38,010
I mean Park Rangers don't make very much,

252
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,487
and there are very few
openings in that field.

253
00:16:40,507 --> 00:16:43,700
Besides, you don't know a
thing about the great outdoors.

254
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,260
Well, that's because you
don't take me to the cabin, so...

255
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,900
I will not discuss this subject.

256
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,980
Now, go to the library,

257
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,666
and study up on the
history of the telephone.

258
00:16:59,402 --> 00:17:01,577
Hey, check this guy out here.

259
00:17:03,535 --> 00:17:06,173
Oh my God.

260
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,480
What a freak boy.

261
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,500
Oh man.

262
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:17,070
Dad could only boss me around so much.

263
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:20,623
I had better things to do
than got to the library.

264
00:18:30,672 --> 00:18:33,572
The trogs, the trogs.

265
00:18:33,592 --> 00:18:34,583
What?

266
00:18:34,603 --> 00:18:37,760
These woods, they're infested with trogs!

267
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,983
Whatever, old man, get out of my way.

268
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,700
I know you, you're the Wilder boy.

269
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,600
How do you know me?

270
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,160
I love your father's radio show.

271
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,603
He's helped me with my life.

272
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,610
Yeah.

273
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,280
It's a shame about your mother.

274
00:18:55,257 --> 00:18:56,780
What do you know about my mother?

275
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,660
It's too sad to recount.

276
00:18:59,562 --> 00:19:03,232
Those trogs, now that's
a story worth telling.

277
00:19:03,252 --> 00:19:04,065
I don't wanna hear

278
00:19:04,085 --> 00:19:05,061
about your stinking trogs, old man.

279
00:19:05,081 --> 00:19:06,770
Get out of my way.

280
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:11,120
Hey kid, kid, can I walk
with you a little while?

281
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,650
It gets lonely out here.

282
00:19:13,896 --> 00:19:14,896
Go away.

283
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,210
Stinking trogs.

284
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,620
What did he mean by trogs?

285
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,270
Shut up, lady.

286
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:40,640
Allow me to tell this story at
my own pace, you understand?

287
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,660
Go on.

288
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,670
Dad always thought I listened to his show

289
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,510
in the safety and comfort
of my own bedroom.

290
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:49,000
Boy was he wrong.

291
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,730
Ever since I was 16,

292
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,350
when I got a portable radio
with earphones for my birthday,

293
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:57,500
I spent my time walking
the streets of Morgantown,

294
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,260
and I'm not ashamed to say it.

295
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,697
I saw a lot of very interesting things.

296
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,993
Well, I'm off to my interview.

297
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,240
Good luck, son.

298
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,880
Let's see what Mrs. Green thinks of this.

299
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:47,840
Dad could force me to
go to the job interview,

300
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,613
but he couldn't force me
to make a good impression.

301
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:06,790
So, Farley, your father tells
me your eager to work here.

302
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,830
Is this true?

303
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,580
Actually, Mrs. Green,
I'm only here to see you.

304
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,346
I've always thought you were
an incredibly attractive woman.

305
00:22:16,366 --> 00:22:17,180
Now, what do you say

306
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,910
you ditch your husband tomorrow after work,

307
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:21,230
and meet me at lover's lane?

308
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,403
I'll be there waiting for you.

309
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,800
I had some thinking to do.

310
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,570
Dad wasn't going to be
happy about my little stunt.

311
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,590
There would be repercussions.

312
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,750
I decided to take a ride down the river,

313
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:38,293
and let all my troubles disappear awhile,

314
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,990
but it turned out I was
in for a rude surprise.

315
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,670
My tube was missing.

316
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,000
Where could it be?

317
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,920
No one ever came into these woods,

318
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,640
but then it dawned on me, the hobo.

319
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,520
He must've seen where I hid it.

320
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,050
I was ready to go look for him

321
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,514
when I got an unexpected visitor.

322
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,620
Hey, Farley, I knew I'd find you here.

323
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,203
Can't believe you still hang
out in these stupid woods.

324
00:23:03,223 --> 00:23:05,950
You need to grown up.

325
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:06,970
What do you want?

326
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:10,740
Well, your dad told
me to come look for you.

327
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,610
I heard you did a really
good job at your interview,

328
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:16,800
and he wants to congratulate
you, so come on.

329
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,390
I won't take no for an answer.

330
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,370
Wait, let me get out of this outfit first.

331
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,790
I gotta get back in my suit.

332
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,710
Your dad says a girl should
never see a boy undress

333
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:28,107
before they're married, I'm leaving.

334
00:23:41,617 --> 00:23:45,263
Congratulations, son, have a seat, son.

335
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,163
I always knew my son would
make a good impression.

336
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,400
Mrs. Green gave me a call.

337
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,830
She said that she never met a young man

338
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,910
with so much potential.

339
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,260
She also wanted to make sure

340
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,070
that you're gonna make
that second interview

341
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,453
as you discussed.

342
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,900
Oh, Freaky Farley,
you're old enough to vote.

343
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,770
Vote for me in the next election.

344
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,177
Okay, Mr. Mayor.

345
00:25:07,135 --> 00:25:08,210
That's a great drawing.

346
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,630
Does she know she's a model?

347
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:11,723
Leave me alone.

348
00:25:12,752 --> 00:25:14,280
So, you're Freaky Farley?

349
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,460
I've been waiting to
meet you for a long time.

350
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,740
What're you talking about?

351
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,090
I'm familiar with your work.

352
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,920
You're a legend around town.

353
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,140
Who are you, Nancy Drew?

354
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,520
I wish, I'm Scarlett Carter.

355
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,090
Can I walk around town tomorrow with you

356
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,223
and see you in action?

357
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,193
I don't care.

358
00:25:32,213 --> 00:25:33,213
It's a free country.

359
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,980
That Scarlett was quite
a beauty, Mrs. Timson,

360
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,590
and smart, and interesting.

361
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,000
I couldn't help but be attracted to her,

362
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,220
but I was also kind of afraid of her.

363
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,670
She was so confident,

364
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:56,290
so knowledgeable on every
little detail of Morgantown.

365
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:58,493
I had never met a girl like her before.

366
00:26:07,843 --> 00:26:09,350
There you are, Freaky Farley.

367
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:12,128
I've been looking for
you all over the place.

368
00:26:12,148 --> 00:26:13,648
Come on, let's go on my route.

369
00:26:34,143 --> 00:26:36,120
I like to go up here past telescope guy,

370
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,870
turning left at the end of the street

371
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,180
near the heavy metal drummer,

372
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,650
and curl around past the witches place.

373
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,430
That witch is a real character.

374
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,720
No matter what time of year,

375
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,040
she always has Halloween decorations up.

376
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,950
I know, I've been studying her.

377
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,590
You ever notice when she goes downtown,

378
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,550
all the guys are falling all over her?

379
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:55,530
Have you seen how short her dresses are?

380
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,460
I guess I really haven't noticed.

381
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,150
Yeah right, all guys are suckers

382
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:00,620
for a girl in a witch costume.

383
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,990
They think that she'll
seduce him or something.

384
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,490
I don't quite get her yet.

385
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,560
I mean does she really
think she has powers,

386
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,573
or is it all just a show for attention?

387
00:27:09,593 --> 00:27:12,050
I think she thinks she has powers.

388
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,920
Yeah, I guess that makes
her a more innocent character.

389
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,090
It's not exactly the most
exciting neighborhood,

390
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:22,280
but I'm able to save money
and concentrate on my work.

391
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,520
I'm kind of writing a novel

392
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,140
about characters in a small
town much like this one.

393
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,230
I'd say you're number three

394
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,770
on the list of local celebrities.

395
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,030
Oh, yeah?

396
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:33,280
Yeah, and ahead
of you is definitely the Ninja.

397
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,191
You know him?

398
00:27:34,211 --> 00:27:35,460
Ninja?

399
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,070
You know, that guy who goes around town

400
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,068
dressed as a Ninja,

401
00:27:38,088 --> 00:27:40,580
hardly ever says anything, really weird.

402
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,350
Oh yeah, maybe I've seen him.

403
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,281
And ahead of the Ninja

404
00:27:43,301 --> 00:27:46,880
is definitely the bearded hobo
who lives down by the river.

405
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,714
I know that guy.

406
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:49,400
He stole my floating tube.

407
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,620
Well, I know where he lives.

408
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,778
I can take you there if you want.

409
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:54,671
You mean now?

410
00:27:54,691 --> 00:27:58,380
Yeah, or are you afraid to
go into the haunted woods?

411
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,214
I'm not afraid.

412
00:27:59,234 --> 00:28:01,510
It's just, well, I should be getting home.

413
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:05,000
My dad's probably gonna be
mad if I don't get home soon.

414
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,470
Okay, next time, see
you around, Freaky Farley.

415
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,790
It was the same old, same old with my dad.

416
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:35,380
He had me back out at the
hole first thing next morning,

417
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,220
but it didn't bother me one single bit.

418
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,260
I was on cloud nine.

419
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,590
I couldn't stop thinking about Scarlett.

420
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,833
I had to find a way to see her again.

421
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:51,190
You should really listen more
closely to your dad's show.

422
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:53,730
Not only would you not
do so much shoveling,

423
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,660
you might actually learn
something from him.

424
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,820
I listen to his advice all day long.

425
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,050
I don't need to listen to it at night too.

426
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,370
Well, I'm really excited

427
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,490
to start working at the station next week.

428
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,450
Anyway, how's it going with
the telephone company thing?

429
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,660
Your dad seems to think you got the job.

430
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,880
He's pretty proud.

431
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,260
Not proud enough that he
didn't punish me this morning.

432
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,587
Well, you know, you're
still living in his house.

433
00:29:15,607 --> 00:29:17,570
You gotta live by his rules.

434
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,803
Why don't you go away?

435
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:24,570
Okay, I'm gonna go lay out
my outfits for work next week.

436
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:29,200
I had nearly forgotten about Mrs. Green

437
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,800
from the phone company.

438
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,850
What was I going to do about her?

439
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:35,720
I told her to meet me
after work that night,

440
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,720
and it seemed like she was really planning

441
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:40,480
to ditch her husband to go out with me.

442
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,953
She must've been in an unhappy marriage.

443
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:46,750
I decided to stake the place out.

444
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:48,643
See if she'd actually show up.

445
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,867
Hey, what're you some kind of weirdo?

446
00:30:06,816 --> 00:30:08,733
Come on in, loverman.

447
00:30:11,767 --> 00:30:14,333
Why don't we um, go to the hotel?

448
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:19,010
Actually, Mrs. Green,

449
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,650
I came here today to tell you

450
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:23,020
that I don't really wanna date you.

451
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,150
I only acted that way in the interview,

452
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,920
because I didn't wanna get the job.

453
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,940
Well, that's an interesting technique.

454
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,840
Yeah, I didn't think you'd
really be interested in me,

455
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,460
and I'm flattered that you were.

456
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,700
Well, I'm glad I flattered you.

457
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,930
Now, if you don't mind,

458
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,590
I need to go home to my husband,

459
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,280
and see if he is still willing

460
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,260
to go on the romantic weekend getaway

461
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,930
that I canceled with him for you.

462
00:30:49,538 --> 00:30:51,101
I, um, I...

463
00:30:51,121 --> 00:30:53,850
You, you, you, here's what's gonna happen,

464
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,390
first thing Monday morning,

465
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:56,730
I'm gonna give your father a call,

466
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,880
and let him know that his son

467
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,490
has no future in the telephone industry,

468
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:04,763
or in any other job in
this town if I can help it.

469
00:31:20,768 --> 00:31:24,003
♪ Freaky Farley, where can he be ♪

470
00:31:24,023 --> 00:31:27,659
♪ Outside my window staring at me ♪

471
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,238
♪ Freaky Farley, what's his plan ♪

472
00:31:31,258 --> 00:31:35,925
♪ Peep as many girls as he possibly can ♪

473
00:31:59,923 --> 00:32:03,090
Ooh, sorry, not usually that clumsy.

474
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,561
Come on, I'm gonna show you
where the bearded hobo lives,

475
00:32:05,581 --> 00:32:07,030
so we can get your tube back.

476
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,080
I can't, my dad makes me

477
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,160
take a listening comprehension
test every morning.

478
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,970
He's gonna be up any second.

479
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,680
Forget him, let's go.

480
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,170
Brush teeth, then go.

481
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:16,990
Understand, good hygiene, then go.

482
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,410
I suppose most hobos have beards,

483
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,910
but I think he's the only hobo
in the entire town anyway,

484
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,450
and calling him just plain hobo

485
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,830
doesn't have such a good ring to it.

486
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:42,840
Don't you agree?

487
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,150
Yeah, the bearded hobo

488
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,360
sounds like a pretty good name to me.

489
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,960
So, I bet you're wondering

490
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,750
how I found out where you live.

491
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:52,480
Yeah, it had crossed my mind.

492
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,730
I did a search on history's
most notorious peeping Tom's,

493
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,340
and your name came up.

494
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,410
Really?

495
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:00,577
Yeah, no silly, I'm just joshing you.

496
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:05,624
Well, you said you had to go home

497
00:33:05,644 --> 00:33:07,330
to listen to your dad's radio show,

498
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,164
and at that time of night

499
00:33:08,184 --> 00:33:10,590
the only option is advice with Rick Wilder,

500
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:12,870
so I looked up Wilder in the phone book.

501
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:13,871
Hmm, clever.

502
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:15,440
I thought so.

503
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,460
There it is.

504
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,563
That bearded hobo, what a jerk.

505
00:33:22,344 --> 00:33:24,430
I can't believe I've
never been here before.

506
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:27,020
I thought I knew every inch
of the Morgantown Woods.

507
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,690
We crossed that line a ways back.

508
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:31,336
These are the haunted woods of Fensdale.

509
00:33:31,356 --> 00:33:36,320
Home to ax murderers,
druids, and the bearded hobo.

510
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,280
So, these are the Fensdale Woods?

511
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,210
I haven't been here in years.

512
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,987
My family's got a cabin out here,

513
00:33:43,007 --> 00:33:45,840
but my dad doesn't let us go anymore.

514
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,760
He probably doesn't wanna be killed.

515
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,620
By whom?

516
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,630
Take your pick.

517
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,860
There are some crazy
cults that meet up here.

518
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,600
This one time on a big
rock, I found black candles,

519
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,393
a pair of panties, and a can of sardines.

520
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:03,150
Maybe some campers were planning

521
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:04,720
a romantic dinner or something.

522
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:09,040
Yeah, right, and then there are the rumors

523
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,660
about the violent forest beasts.

524
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:14,090
Let's get outta here.

525
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,217
What about your tube?

526
00:34:15,237 --> 00:34:18,110
Oh, we'll come back sometime
when the bearded hobo's here,

527
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:18,944
and you know,

528
00:34:18,964 --> 00:34:21,100
it would be better if
I had the satisfaction

529
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,470
of watching him watch me
take it away from him.

530
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,540
Okay, I'll buy it.

531
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,560
I was getting ready to call you chicken.

532
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,300
You know, um, if we keep
on hanging out like this,

533
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,670
you'll have lots of
chances to call me chicken.

534
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,120
Yeah, and anyway, I should be getting back,

535
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:44,470
because uh, forget about
being murdered by monsters.

536
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:47,593
I got a dad back home who's
probably planning to kill me.

537
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,373
Home sweet home.

538
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:59,270
Hey, looks like someone got up early today.

539
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:01,520
Yeah, I went for
a little walk in the woods.

540
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,501
I'm sorry I didn't leave a note,

541
00:35:02,521 --> 00:35:03,820
but I'm ready to take my test.

542
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,750
Oh, no test today, son.

543
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,020
After all, you'll be employed soon.

544
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,800
A young man, not a boy anymore.

545
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,623
How'd that second interview go?

546
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,220
I'm not so sure I want the job.

547
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,990
Oh, you'll take the job, young man.

548
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:18,380
It's okay to have dreams,

549
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,091
but better to have a regular paycheck.

550
00:35:21,111 --> 00:35:26,111
Yeah, I guess we'll be hearing
from Mrs. Green on Monday.

551
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,833
Good, I'm proud of you.

552
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,356
It feels good to say that.

553
00:35:34,376 --> 00:35:35,376
I'm proud of you.

554
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,320
Dad.

555
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,180
Yeah, son.

556
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,570
I was thinking about the cabin

557
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,380
that we used to go to with Mom.

558
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,770
It's in the Fensdale Woods, right?

559
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:51,420
Whatever you're getting
at the answer is no,

560
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,170
and I don't want you to bring it up again.

561
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,720
Do you hear me?

562
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,793
That cabin is in the middle of
a dangerous stretch of woods.

563
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,360
You haven't been up there, have you?

564
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,630
No, sir, I don't even remember where it is.

565
00:36:05,978 --> 00:36:06,978
Good.

566
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:13,210
Hey Farley, whatcha doing?

567
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,590
Leave me alone.

568
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,000
Golly, I was just gonna ask you

569
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,663
if you were gonna go see your girlfriend.

570
00:36:19,521 --> 00:36:20,790
What're you talking about?

571
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,430
You know what I'm talking about.

572
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:24,400
Word around town is that
you and Scarlett Carter

573
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,200
are a hot item.

574
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,520
Where'd you hear that?

575
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,623
I know people.

576
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,270
Whatever.

577
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,300
What's bothering you so much?

578
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,100
It's nothing, it's just
my dad and I got in a fight.

579
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,540
What else is new?

580
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,531
Well, it's different this time.

581
00:36:39,551 --> 00:36:41,940
I brought up a subject
that we never discuss.

582
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,960
The cabin?

583
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,470
How do you know about the cabin?

584
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:49,090
Well, your dad and me, we confide.

585
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:52,050
Yeah, ever since Mom died,

586
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,990
Dad never takes me there anymore.

587
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,610
I mean just because she
got in a car accident

588
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,220
on the way home from the cabin?

589
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,240
I don't get it.

590
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,230
All I can say is this, trust your dad.

591
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,283
He's a wonderful man.

592
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,490
I'm going this way.

593
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,920
Mom had driven out to the
cabin one weekend in May.

594
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,283
I remember because my
birthday's on the third.

595
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,020
She was going to straighten
things out for the summer.

596
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,210
The next day,

597
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:22,660
Dad told me she had died in a car accident

598
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,220
while driving home.

599
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,253
After that we never talked about Mom again.

600
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:31,360
I was feeling pretty low, Mrs. Timson,

601
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,140
but it didn't last.

602
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,550
And why was that.

603
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:36,830
Because I saw Scarlett again.

604
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:39,020
There was just something about that girl.

605
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,270
She seemed to make all
my troubles disappear.

606
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:42,104
Just a minute.

607
00:37:42,124 --> 00:37:43,273
Let me reload the tape.

608
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,210
But what if I wanna keep telling the story?

609
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,288
Like the time...

610
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:49,343
No, no, wait, wait,
wait till I load the tape.

611
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,483
Are you ready now?

612
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:01,313
These were the best days of my life by far.

613
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,630
Just being around Scarlett was
changing me for the better.

614
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,181
So, besides walking, what
do you like to do for fun?

615
00:38:08,201 --> 00:38:09,510
Do you like to go to parties?

616
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,030
Have you ever been to a party?

617
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,300
Farley.

618
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,455
Do you like that girl?

619
00:38:21,475 --> 00:38:22,730
You should go talk to her.

620
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,620
Oh no, Scarlett, I couldn't do that.

621
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,980
I get kind of nervous around girls.

622
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,913
Besides, that dog looks ferocious.

623
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,810
All you need is some practice.

624
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,820
Pretend I'm that girl.

625
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,253
Um, I, uh.

626
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,853
Forget that, I'll be you, you be her.

627
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:45,040
I'm Freaky Farley, I usually
spy on girls through windows,

628
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,210
but now I'm gonna talk to you face to face.

629
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:51,220
Just kidding, more like this.

630
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,390
Oh, what a cute dog you have.

631
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:53,224
What kind is it?

632
00:38:53,244 --> 00:38:55,040
Uh, uh, I don't know.

633
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,230
You don't know what kind of dog you have?

634
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,670
What kind of pet owner are you?

635
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:59,640
You wanna go to the movies?

636
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:02,460
Sure, Scarlett, I'd love
to go to the movies with you.

637
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,150
Perfect, see how good it works?

638
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,170
Now, go ask her.

639
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,550
Aw shucks, we missed her.

640
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:20,355
You'll just have to talk to her next time.

641
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:22,919
Come here, there's
something I wanna show you.

642
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:31,210
Oh my God, he's doing some
kind of cat scratch thing,

643
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:33,220
like tiger kung foo or something.

644
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,240
Check it out.

645
00:39:36,686 --> 00:39:38,233
Silly Ninja.

646
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,844
I think this is all for show.

647
00:39:42,864 --> 00:39:44,980
I bet he couldn't even beat me up.

648
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,230
Yeah, he looks like a
total wimp, no offense.

649
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,950
None taken, I'll test our
little theory, watch this.

650
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:02,620
Hey Ninja, you think because
you wear those ninja clothes

651
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,240
and do those stupid exercises

652
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,740
that nobody will challenge you to a fight?

653
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,460
Well, you're wrong.

654
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,083
I challenge you to a fight.

655
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,203
All right.

656
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,803
I did it, I intimidated Ninja.

657
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:24,001
Am I your hero, Farley?

658
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:24,901
Um.

659
00:40:24,921 --> 00:40:27,170
I said, am I your hero?

660
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:30,060
Yeah, maybe I should put you down.

661
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,530
I think that's a good idea.

662
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,430
Scarlett!

663
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,840
Farley, if this is about you

664
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,300
having some sort of crush on me,

665
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,540
you can forget it.

666
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,810
You're not man enough
for me and you know it.

667
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:52,690
Now, come on, let's go get your tube back

668
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,310
from the bearded hobo.

669
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:56,770
Of course, her
telling me that I wasn't worthy,

670
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,420
made me love her more.

671
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,100
She was everything I'd
dreamed of in a girl.

672
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,890
I didn't even care that she
belittled my meager attempt

673
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:05,560
at a profession of love.

674
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,160
She was right anyway.

675
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,310
I couldn't handle someone like her.

676
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:12,650
That weekend was the
best weekend of my life.

677
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,707
Dad wouldn't find out

678
00:41:13,727 --> 00:41:16,460
how I blew the job interview until Monday,

679
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,220
so I had two precious days of freedom

680
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,590
that I could spend entirely

681
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:25,310
with my new friend, my
best friend, my dream girl.

682
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,327
What?

683
00:41:43,807 --> 00:41:46,077
Ow, that hurt!

684
00:41:46,097 --> 00:41:48,310
Oh, it's you again.

685
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:53,180
Look, little lady, why don't
you just stop terrorizing me!

686
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,560
I've got enough to handle

687
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:57,520
with this family of trogs out here.

688
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,720
You know, they're not babies anymore.

689
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:02,910
They're getting bigger and
bigger and hungrier and hungrier.

690
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,990
Yeah, yeah, the trogs.

691
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:06,650
I'm still mad you poked me.

692
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:08,460
I could sue you for all
you're worth, you know.

693
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,040
No, no, please don't, I'm sorry.

694
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,376
I didn't know you were there.

695
00:42:11,396 --> 00:42:13,260
I'll do anything.

696
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,035
Why don't you take me to see
the trogs, Mr. Bearded Hobo?

697
00:42:17,055 --> 00:42:22,055
Sure, sure, hey wait, why
do you wanna go see the trogs?

698
00:42:22,538 --> 00:42:24,420
Don't you know they're dangerous?

699
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,060
I still wanna see them, or I'll sue.

700
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,693
Oh, okay, okay.

701
00:42:43,113 --> 00:42:44,530
Now!

702
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,273
Nobody steals from Freaky Farley!

703
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,713
You little minx.

704
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:55,810
Sorry, I guess you'll
have to show me your trogs

705
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:57,343
some other time, Mr. Hobo.

706
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:07,350
Do you always speak of
yourself in the third person?

707
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:09,118
I thought it would
be nice for dramatic effect.

708
00:43:09,138 --> 00:43:10,221
I liked it.

709
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,750
That guy's crazy.

710
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:17,720
He always talks about these
trogs that he takes care of.

711
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:20,350
I didn't know that you'd
ever even talked to him before.

712
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:23,330
Oh, yeah, I go out there and
terrorize him all the time.

713
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,510
We need loonies out there.

714
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:26,220
It makes the world more interesting.

715
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,240
Let's go swimming.

716
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:31,150
But Scarlett, I don't
even have a bathing suit.

717
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:32,790
Don't tell me you need
a swimsuit, nature boy.

718
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,290
You practically live in the woods.

719
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:37,423
Scarlett, uh, what do you mean?

720
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:42,523
Scarlett, the water's uh,
the water's really cold.

721
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,960
Wow, Farley, you have no problem

722
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,620
watching naked girls through their window,

723
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,750
but you have a lot more
trouble when they're close up.

724
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:58,020
Tomorrow we'll steal the
key to your dad's cabin,

725
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,660
and the next day we can
go check the place out.

726
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,680
Okay.

727
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,900
I'll meet you at your place tomorrow.

728
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,734
Now, get out of here.

729
00:44:05,754 --> 00:44:07,797
I'm suddenly quite ashamed of my nakedness.

730
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:11,270
All right.

731
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,053
Just, just catching up on my reading.

732
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:44,440
Son, it's time we talked about women.

733
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,710
Dad, I've heard your
opinion on relationships

734
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:48,140
every night on your radio show.

735
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,060
I think I know your views.

736
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:54,100
A father has every right to
talk to his son man to man.

737
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,980
Well, what is it?

738
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,390
Well, I understand that you've
been seeing a girl lately.

739
00:44:58,410 --> 00:44:59,371
How do you know about that?

740
00:44:59,391 --> 00:45:01,250
That's not important.

741
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:04,350
A father has every right to
know what his son is up to.

742
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:05,930
Now, let me tell you something.

743
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:07,630
I really believe that you should stay away

744
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:08,840
from that crazy girl,

745
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:11,780
and start seeing a nice,
wholesome young woman.

746
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,840
You don't know anything about Scarlett.

747
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,900
I might not know much about her,

748
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,090
but I do know a lot
about the girl next door.

749
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:22,690
She's a sweet, kind,
young, intelligent woman

750
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:25,390
that would make a perfect
daughter-in-law some day.

751
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:27,250
Katie, are you serious?

752
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:29,270
She's the most annoying girl in the world.

753
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:31,920
You may find my advice
slightly annoying, son,

754
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:35,180
but someday you'll come to appreciate it.

755
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,893
Now, just consider Katie for awhile.

756
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:41,253
I'm not gonna punish you for your rudeness,

757
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:44,960
because you did so well
on your job interview.

758
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:47,240
Someday you'll be an independent man,

759
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:49,870
and you'll make your own decisions.

760
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:51,690
My only hope is that you choose

761
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:53,973
to obey and respect you father.

762
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:59,361
I'm gonna go take a walk in the woods.

763
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:09,760
Hey, Farley.

764
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:10,594
You were just listening

765
00:46:10,614 --> 00:46:11,890
to this whole conversation?

766
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:13,640
You and my dad are unbelievable.

767
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:14,474
You wanna come with me

768
00:46:14,494 --> 00:46:16,340
for the Spencer Farm Moonlight Hayride?

769
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,780
No, didn't you just hear me call you

770
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,510
the most annoying girl in the world?

771
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:20,950
Get out of here.

772
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:23,027
Okay, deny your feelings if you must,

773
00:46:23,047 --> 00:46:24,797
but you know where you can find me.

774
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:32,330
The next morning while Dad was away,

775
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:33,680
Scarlett showed up.

776
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:37,400
She wanted to find the key
to the cabin and maybe a map.

777
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,483
I was a little scared, but
I couldn't say no to her.

778
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:49,300
Now, if I was a key, where would I be?

779
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,650
Scarlett, we gotta be careful.

780
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:53,210
My dad will notice if
anything's been moved.

781
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:54,230
We'll find it.

782
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:40,691
Farley!

783
00:47:40,711 --> 00:47:43,200
Oh man, that's my dad.

784
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:44,600
He doesn't let me have
girls over the house.

785
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:45,673
He's gonna kill me.

786
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:04,490
So, this is your plan, Farley.

787
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:06,117
Wait till your father gets
home and get me in the closet?

788
00:48:06,137 --> 00:48:07,421
Oh, Scarlett, I wouldn't do anything...

789
00:48:07,441 --> 00:48:10,091
Whatever, come on, we've
got a window to climb out.

790
00:48:14,356 --> 00:48:16,812
What do you think your dad
would've done if he found us?

791
00:48:16,832 --> 00:48:18,127
I don't even wanna think about it.

792
00:48:18,147 --> 00:48:20,907
Do you think violence would've ensued?

793
00:48:20,927 --> 00:48:21,741
A few years ago no,

794
00:48:21,761 --> 00:48:24,383
but lately he's been goin so crazy, maybe.

795
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:28,180
See that guy?

796
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,101
Yeah.

797
00:48:29,121 --> 00:48:31,480
I call him the lyric poet.

798
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:32,640
He's really cool.

799
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:36,320
Always here composing poetry,
probably about some girl.

800
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:37,930
Yeah, probably.

801
00:48:37,950 --> 00:48:41,670
I like a guy who goes to the
library at least one a month.

802
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:44,253
Anyway, he's gonna be a
major character in my book.

803
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:46,690
Am I in your book?

804
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:48,853
We'll have to wait and see.

805
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:53,673
Here's a map of Fensdale Woods.

806
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,463
Your dad's cabin is right here.

807
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,640
What good's the cabin
if we don't have a key?

808
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,253
Oh, I forgot to mention.

809
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:07,034
I found the key in the closet

810
00:49:07,054 --> 00:49:09,223
when we were oh so close to each other.

811
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:14,853
So Farley, are you gonna
invite me to your dad's cabin?

812
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:18,900
Yeah, um, I wanna get there a little early

813
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:19,841
and check it out though.

814
00:49:19,861 --> 00:49:21,493
Why don't you meet me there at noon?

815
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:27,430
The next morning was like a
trip back to reality for me.

816
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:28,830
I had such a great weekend

817
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:31,450
that I'd forgotten all
about Mrs. Green's promise

818
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:32,848
to call my dad.

819
00:49:33,702 --> 00:49:36,483
But as soon as the phone
rang, I knew it was over.

820
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,720
Hello?

821
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:01,100
Well, I'm sorry to hear
about that, Mrs. Green.

822
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,300
He will be getting a talking to now,

823
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,743
and for weeks to come.

824
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,823
All right, goodbye.

825
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:17,173
That was Mrs. Green, Farley.

826
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,890
She said that the interview
didn't go so well.

827
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:25,420
She also said that you were
completely unprofessional

828
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,713
and that you don't have a
future in any field whatsoever.

829
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:31,900
I'll go get the shovel.

830
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:35,010
No, this calls for more drastic measures.

831
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:36,900
First of all, you're not
to see that harlot again.

832
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,610
Her name is Scarlett.

833
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:39,444
Second of all,

834
00:50:39,464 --> 00:50:41,810
you're to donate your
floating tube to Goodwill.

835
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,730
But I use my floating tube all the time.

836
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:44,920
Well, you should've thought about that

837
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:47,513
before you embarrassed the family, now go.

838
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:50,200
No.

839
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:51,253
Excuse me?

840
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:55,030
No, I won't do it.

841
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:58,000
You dare talk back to me
after all I've done for you?

842
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:02,163
Stop, you go out that door, and
there will be repercussions.

843
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:07,523
You'll be sorry, Farley Wilder!

844
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:13,970
I wanted to get out of Morgantown

845
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:15,060
once and for all.

846
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,630
Just start walking and never come back,

847
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:20,300
but first there was
somewhere I needed to go.

848
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,800
Somewhere I hadn't been in years.

849
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:25,440
As a boy, I had been so happy there,

850
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:29,140
and then suddenly everything just went bad.

851
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:32,670
Everyone always said the
Fensdale Woods were dangerous,

852
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:35,143
but I just had to see that cabin.

853
00:53:14,347 --> 00:53:16,833
Why do you continually disobey me?

854
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:19,770
Why do you feel the need to test

855
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:21,720
every rule I've made for you?

856
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,850
You asked me why we don't come out here.

857
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:26,530
It's because weird things happen out here,

858
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:28,160
and if the mayor wasn't in such denial,

859
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:30,700
he would've done something about it by now.

860
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,220
I want to hear it from
you once and for all,

861
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,290
why won't you just tell me what happened?

862
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:41,903
Because it was all too painful.

863
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:44,750
Your mother was killed out here.

864
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:49,483
Saying she died in a car
accident just made things tidy.

865
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:54,103
It was all so confusing.

866
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,360
But if you just...

867
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:59,103
It's my burden to bare.

868
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,220
You were just a child,

869
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,020
and children shouldn't
have to be frightened

870
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:05,883
of mysterious deaths in the woods,

871
00:54:06,830 --> 00:54:09,293
so I told you she died in a car accident.

872
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:13,130
And when you tell a story like
that, you better stick to it.

873
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:14,550
Lest they lose faith in you,

874
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:18,080
but you lost faith in me anyways.

875
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:19,853
You lost faith in your father.

876
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:24,050
Why, I don't know?

877
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:25,770
I've tried for years and years

878
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:28,040
to break that rebellious streak out of you,

879
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:30,310
and nothing, nothing at all.

880
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:32,370
You are a stubborn, stubborn boy

881
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:35,290
who is only gonna do
whatever you want to do.

882
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:36,520
Well, thanks to your stubbornness,

883
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:39,250
you put yourself in
danger and that girl too.

884
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:40,560
As it looks like you two

885
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:43,120
were getting ready to have
a little get together.

886
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:46,380
That's right, Scarlett is
planning to meet me here.

887
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,313
These woods are so dangerous.

888
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:51,780
I don't even know if
she's gonna make it here.

889
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:55,080
Why, son, why didn't you listen to me?

890
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:58,040
The rest of Morgantown
listens to my advice.

891
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:01,240
I get paid good money to give good advice,

892
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:03,440
but my own son is so pig headed,

893
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:06,170
he'd rather risk a young girl's life,

894
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:08,940
than to admit that his father is right.

895
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,960
Well, I am right, and
I've always been right.

896
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:13,630
Now, we're gonna finally figure out a way

897
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:15,090
to straighten out your life.

898
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:16,883
Now, I'm taking you home.

899
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,450
Are you disobeying me?

900
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:23,926
I'm only gonna say this once, get up.

901
00:55:48,290 --> 00:55:50,783
Farley, how could you?

902
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:52,907
Like this.

903
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:05,900
He was finally dead and
that's when I saw her.

904
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,050
Katie, she'd seen it all,

905
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:11,493
and now she needed to be killed.

906
00:56:40,933 --> 00:56:43,500
My trogs keep growing, Farley!

907
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,861
They're coming after me!

908
00:56:44,881 --> 00:56:46,240
They're gonna eat me!

909
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:47,901
They're coming after me, Farley!

910
00:56:47,921 --> 00:56:48,921
They're coming after me!

911
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:56,700
What happened after that?

912
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,960
Patience, Mrs. Timson.

913
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:01,563
Allow me to tell the story at my own pace.

914
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:04,673
Although I am getting a bit thirsty.

915
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,720
Now, where was I?

916
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:21,417
Well, you just stabbed the hobo,

917
00:57:21,437 --> 00:57:23,993
and you were basically, completely insane.

918
00:57:25,589 --> 00:57:26,589
Right.

919
00:57:39,463 --> 00:57:40,813
Hey, dude, a little help.

920
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:52,899
Playtime is over.

921
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,433
Dude, not cool.

922
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:05,010
Hey, freakmiester.

923
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:07,274
Busy!

924
00:58:07,294 --> 00:58:09,640
Too busy to talk to your
old pal, Air Force Ricky?

925
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:12,434
Whoa, don't you know it's
not polite to ignore people?

926
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:18,113
Recruitment day!

927
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:58,120
I was in a murderous rage, Mrs. Timson,

928
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:01,433
but I wasn't about to kill
a poor, innocent little boy.

929
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:05,010
Finally, I made it to Katie's house.

930
00:59:05,030 --> 00:59:08,380
She was about to pay for all
those years of annoying me,

931
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,310
and agreeing with my dad.

932
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:14,191
She was about to pay the
ultimate price, but then.

933
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:36,700
I need the police!

934
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:37,534
I called earlier.

935
00:59:37,554 --> 00:59:39,005
Where are they?

936
00:59:44,137 --> 00:59:45,150
When I woke up,

937
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:47,930
they told me it was the
Ninja who did that to me.

938
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:49,680
Can you believe that Ninja?

939
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:50,700
What a wimp.

940
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:53,450
If we had fought face to face,

941
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:55,293
he wouldn't even have a chance.

942
00:59:58,610 --> 01:00:01,983
Since then I've just been
in here waiting to die.

943
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:05,623
Sometimes though, I do draw.

944
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:12,410
What?

945
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:15,260
You're not telling me everything.

946
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:17,680
Well, I did leave out

947
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:19,920
all the times I went to the bathroom,

948
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:22,850
but I figured it wasn't
important to my story.

949
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:23,930
Quit it, Farley.

950
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:25,390
Something happened in the woods

951
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:27,210
on the day that you killed everyone.

952
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,090
Says who?

953
01:00:30,110 --> 01:00:34,240
Says me, the examiner
says it was around noon

954
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:35,650
when your father was killed.

955
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:37,830
10 minutes later the hobo was dead.

956
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:39,480
Then it wasn't until four o'clock

957
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,110
when the football players died.

958
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:42,440
Now, you know as well as I

959
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:44,010
that it wouldn't take you four hours

960
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:46,620
to get back to town from Fensdale Woods,

961
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,480
especially for somebody
who knows those woods

962
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,703
as well as you did.

963
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:53,210
You could've done it in 45 minutes.

964
01:00:53,230 --> 01:00:56,800
What're you suggesting, Mrs. Timson?

965
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:59,990
I'm suggesting that something happened

966
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:01,710
during those four hours.

967
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:04,843
Something that you've never
told anyone else about.

968
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:08,790
And what makes you think I'd tell you?

969
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:12,670
If what happened out there
is what I think happened,

970
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:14,700
it'll be well worth your while.

971
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,050
It could give you a chance

972
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:18,573
to see the world outside these walls.

973
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:20,641
Really?

974
01:01:20,661 --> 01:01:22,543
Yes, really.

975
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:31,630
Well then, I never thought
I'd tell this to anyone.

976
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:34,590
I thought I'd take this one to my grave,

977
01:01:34,610 --> 01:01:39,610
but if it means what you
say it might mean, why not?

978
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,530
Just after killing the hobo, I heard it,

979
01:01:42,550 --> 01:01:45,658
I heard her, Scarlett's cries for help.

980
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,620
And mixed in with her cries,

981
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:51,430
something unlike I've ever heard before.

982
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:54,653
An unholy sound, a monsters roar.

983
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:04,260
Farley.

984
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,080
Scarlett, I'm so sorry.

985
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:08,130
I didn't know there were
beasts in these woods.

986
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:09,470
I never would've invited you here.

987
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:11,280
I'm so sorry.

988
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:13,440
Farley, it's not your fault.

989
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:15,160
I need you to do something for me.

990
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,590
In my room, above the garage,

991
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:23,370
in my desk, in a box is my manuscript.

992
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:25,650
I need you to get it published for me,

993
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:28,420
after you check it for spelling
and grammar, of course.

994
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,507
She was dead.

995
01:02:43,527 --> 01:02:45,833
My Scarlett was dead and gone forever.

996
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:49,563
Then I came face to face with her killers.

997
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:53,070
That's right, Mrs. Timson.

998
01:02:53,090 --> 01:02:55,530
The trogs really did exist.

999
01:02:55,550 --> 01:02:57,670
I didn't even need my knife.

1000
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,073
I was so filled with rage.

1001
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,870
They had killed Scarlett.

1002
01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:03,190
They had killed my mother.

1003
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,692
They got what was coming to them.

1004
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:25,860
After killing the monsters,
I felt I could do anything,

1005
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:28,350
but Katie was the first order of business.

1006
01:03:28,370 --> 01:03:31,523
I had to get her before
she told the police.

1007
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:35,410
That's everything I need to know.

1008
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:38,530
Thank you, Farley, we'll be in touch.

1009
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:40,760
But what about your end of the bargain?

1010
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:44,460
I just revealed to you the
only secret I've got left.

1011
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:47,050
And I'll make sure the right
people find out about it.

1012
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:49,180
Just give me a few days.

1013
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,970
Farley, if you had to,

1014
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:54,810
do you think you could
kill those beasts again?

1015
01:03:54,830 --> 01:03:59,200
You have no idea what I'm
capable of, Mrs. Timson.

1016
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:01,723
No idea at all.

1017
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:19,250
Luckily, these deaths have all happened

1018
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:20,141
so deep in the woods

1019
01:04:20,161 --> 01:04:22,890
that nobody has had to
witness such tragedy.

1020
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:24,390
Yesterday's incident, however,

1021
01:04:24,410 --> 01:04:26,330
was the closest to town we've had,

1022
01:04:26,350 --> 01:04:28,180
causing some to criticize our fine mayor

1023
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,870
for refusing the governors offer

1024
01:04:29,890 --> 01:04:31,700
to send in the National Guard.

1025
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:33,370
Here's what the mayor had to say.

1026
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:35,141
Morgantown has always

1027
01:04:35,161 --> 01:04:37,460
taken care of its own problems,

1028
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:39,710
and will continue to do so.

1029
01:04:39,730 --> 01:04:42,380
The only reason the governor or his army

1030
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:43,810
should come to our town

1031
01:04:43,830 --> 01:04:48,340
is to take on our world
famous Apple Bobbing Festival.

1032
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:51,733
A wonderful event, fun
for the whole family.

1033
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:04,600
Hey, any visitors for me today?

1034
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:05,973
No, nothing.

1035
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,830
This is Tess Howard.

1036
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:16,650
She answers the phone here at City Hall.

1037
01:05:16,670 --> 01:05:18,763
We call her the communications director.

1038
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,730
Mr. Mayor, may I begin?

1039
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:24,973
No, you may not.

1040
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:29,330
This meeting is clearly confidential.

1041
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:30,820
If anyone discovers

1042
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:33,580
the woods are filled with the hungry trogs,

1043
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:36,280
and not just routine grizzly bears,

1044
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:39,760
no one will come to our Apple
Bobbing Festival this year.

1045
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:42,190
Do you understand?

1046
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:44,400
Now, let's hear from our town witch.

1047
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:45,850
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

1048
01:05:45,870 --> 01:05:49,250
I'm fairly certain I've
concocted the perfect potion

1049
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:51,750
to rid this town of
beasts once and for all.

1050
01:05:51,770 --> 01:05:54,080
If you'll provide me with
the proper protection,

1051
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:57,580
I'll go into the woods
and take care of business.

1052
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,570
Well, sounds reasonable to me.

1053
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:01,660
But, Mr. Mayor.

1054
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,100
What is it?

1055
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:04,320
Over the past year,

1056
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:07,430
we have sent some of
our most resourceful men

1057
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:08,450
into those woods,

1058
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:09,810
and what has happened?

1059
01:06:09,830 --> 01:06:11,210
Each one of them has become

1060
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:13,890
a delightful meal for these beasts.

1061
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:15,920
There is one man who not only

1062
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:18,320
survived his encounter with these beasts,

1063
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:20,433
but he actually killed some of them.

1064
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,060
Farley Wilder has never
admitted he killed those beasts.

1065
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,390
Until now that is.

1066
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:29,270
- It's true, folks, Dr.
Timson played me the tapes.

1067
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:31,380
Farley really did kill those beasts.

1068
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,170
But we can't let this maniac go free.

1069
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:35,490
He's killed so many innocent people.

1070
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:37,990
We won't give him any weapons this time.

1071
01:06:38,010 --> 01:06:40,320
He can kill them with his bare hands.

1072
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:43,030
It's either him or the National Guard.

1073
01:06:43,050 --> 01:06:46,257
There will be no National
Guard coming to our town

1074
01:06:46,277 --> 01:06:48,673
for anything other than apple bobbing.

1075
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:53,913
Let's not forget the
town's witch's suggestion.

1076
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:57,743
I happen to think she shows some potential.

1077
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:02,270
Mr. Mayor, you can't be serious.

1078
01:07:02,290 --> 01:07:03,683
Just look at her.

1079
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:07,693
She means business.

1080
01:07:10,131 --> 01:07:12,650
Farley's the only one who
can kill these beasts,

1081
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:15,253
but we know the one man
that can stop Farley.

1082
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:38,730
Yes, freedom is mine!

1083
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:41,430
Now, Farley,

1084
01:07:41,450 --> 01:07:44,050
the mayor has agreed to your request.

1085
01:07:44,070 --> 01:07:46,220
Each summer, one day a month,

1086
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:47,520
you will be able to take

1087
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:50,070
a relaxing tube ride down the river,

1088
01:07:50,090 --> 01:07:52,510
supervised, of course.

1089
01:07:52,530 --> 01:07:55,850
You will receive this reward
only if the team is successful.

1090
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:59,460
You will be going into the
woods with two other people.

1091
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,920
One will be Denise, the town witch,

1092
01:08:01,940 --> 01:08:03,840
who seems to think she can drive

1093
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:05,820
the beasts off with a spell.

1094
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,690
Apparently, the mayor was rather smitten

1095
01:08:07,710 --> 01:08:08,671
with this young girl,

1096
01:08:08,691 --> 01:08:10,890
and just couldn't refuse her.

1097
01:08:10,910 --> 01:08:12,560
The other will be Ninja.

1098
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:13,790
Ninja?

1099
01:08:13,810 --> 01:08:14,711
That's right.

1100
01:08:14,731 --> 01:08:18,500
The mayor wants to make sure
you won't try any funny stuff,

1101
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:20,790
like coming into town to kill again,

1102
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:23,291
so Ninja will be watching over you.

1103
01:08:23,311 --> 01:08:27,143
Ninja, I can't wait to see him again.

1104
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:36,320
Finally.

1105
01:08:44,010 --> 01:08:46,560
So, the infamous Farley.

1106
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:49,113
Never expected to see
you out and about again.

1107
01:08:50,618 --> 01:08:53,870
Do you see that you've got
your arch nemesis here?

1108
01:08:53,890 --> 01:08:56,590
I've hired him to keep an eye on you.

1109
01:08:56,610 --> 01:09:01,390
One false move and he'll do
you in like he did before.

1110
01:09:01,410 --> 01:09:03,303
Farley, do you understand me?

1111
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:07,593
Absolutely, Mr. Mayor.

1112
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:09,651
So it's true.

1113
01:09:09,671 --> 01:09:11,590
Can you really kill these beasts?

1114
01:09:11,610 --> 01:09:12,710
That's right, Mr. Mayor,

1115
01:09:12,730 --> 01:09:15,130
and could kill you if I wanted to.

1116
01:09:15,150 --> 01:09:15,964
Luckily for you,

1117
01:09:15,984 --> 01:09:18,710
I don't feel much like
killing you right now.

1118
01:09:18,730 --> 01:09:20,380
You'll be free for one day,

1119
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,560
then back to the loony
bin where you belong.

1120
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:24,620
Do you understand, Farley?

1121
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,623
Happy to help the city, Mr. Mayor.

1122
01:09:29,037 --> 01:09:30,223
What're we waiting for?

1123
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,374
Let's kill some beasts.

1124
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,273
So, what's in the bag, witch?

1125
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:17,787
Lots of things, my spellbook,

1126
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:22,763
my divining powders, my healing berries.

1127
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:27,110
She seems pretty confident,
doesn't she, Ninja?

1128
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:31,883
For your information, I am quite confident.

1129
01:10:32,810 --> 01:10:35,970
You'd be surprised by the
power that nature has.

1130
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:40,021
Well, you'll be surprised
by the powers my fists have.

1131
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:55,830
Just keeping you on your toes, Ninja.

1132
01:10:55,850 --> 01:10:58,190
How much longer until we get there?

1133
01:10:58,210 --> 01:10:59,943
My feet are killing me.

1134
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:04,290
Hello, are either one
of you gonna answer me?

1135
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:23,533
Trog tracks, and they're fresh.

1136
01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:25,660
We're probably close.

1137
01:11:27,099 --> 01:11:29,299
Time to start practicing
your spells, witch.

1138
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:33,890
I was gonna practice anyway.

1139
01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:36,323
I'm not just doing it
because you told me to.

1140
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:39,820
Copper, copper, behold the law.

1141
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,000
Twice the moon beyond the sky.

1142
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:44,030
Reach to cut the golden bough.

1143
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:46,173
Perish darkness, quell the lies.

1144
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:48,510
A lot of good

1145
01:11:48,530 --> 01:11:50,413
these nursery rhymes are gonna be.

1146
01:12:06,370 --> 01:12:08,240
Copper, copper, behold the law.

1147
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:10,220
Twice the moon beyond the sky.

1148
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:12,370
Reach to cut the golden bough.

1149
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:15,513
Perish darkness, quell the lies.

1150
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:20,583
This is it, witch, you're on.

1151
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,199
Unholy powder for unholy beast.

1152
01:12:24,219 --> 01:12:26,393
Unholy powder for unholy beast.

1153
01:12:26,413 --> 01:12:30,791
Let me go, let me go!

1154
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:46,213
Hey, Ninja, you ready to
watch a killing machine?

1155
01:13:17,383 --> 01:13:19,550
One trog down, who's next?

1156
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:35,217
Hey, Ninja, you wanna finish this one off?

1157
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:59,820
Well, Ninja, guess it's time for you

1158
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,340
to bring me back to the mayor.

1159
01:15:06,914 --> 01:15:07,821
Of course, you could always say

1160
01:15:07,841 --> 01:15:10,403
that you lost me out
here in the wilderness.

1161
01:15:14,289 --> 01:15:17,420
No, you wouldn't do a thing like that.

1162
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:20,523
You're an honorable Ninja, let's go.

1163
01:15:28,698 --> 01:15:31,281
Are you sure this is the place?

1164
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:40,830
You're lucky I like you.

1165
01:15:40,850 --> 01:15:43,307
Otherwise, I would've left
you in the woods.

1166
01:16:06,530 --> 01:16:08,390
Ninja, what happened?

1167
01:16:08,410 --> 01:16:09,560
Did the beasts get you?

1168
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:14,260
Farley?

1169
01:16:16,410 --> 01:16:18,220
He's on the loose.

1170
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:21,023
I have to warn the people
now, the townspeople.

1171
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:59,783
W-M-O-R, more talk radio.

1172
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:04,370
Hi, you're listening to
advice with Katie Reidy.

1173
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:07,270
Each day I proudly dish out
your daily dose of advice

1174
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:08,730
in the spirit and tradition

1175
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:11,453
of my mentor and advisor, Rick Wilder.

1176
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:17,170
Right now, we have Lester on the line.

1177
01:17:17,190 --> 01:17:18,740
Thanks for calling, Lester.

1178
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:21,877
Hi Katie, I just love your upbeat style.

1179
01:17:21,897 --> 01:17:23,680
Ah, thanks a lot, Lester.

1180
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:26,380
You know, having a positive outlook on life

1181
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,543
is really important to one's success.

1182
01:17:29,430 --> 01:17:31,640
I honestly don't know
where I'd be right now,

1183
01:17:31,660 --> 01:17:33,930
if I didn't look on the
bright side of things.

1184
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:38,210
Same goes for me,

1185
01:17:38,230 --> 01:17:39,131
but the reason I'm calling

1186
01:17:39,151 --> 01:17:40,480
is that I have a bit of a problem.

1187
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:41,820
You see, I usually have a booth

1188
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:42,654
at the Morgantown Apple Bobbing Festival.

1189
01:17:42,674 --> 01:17:45,018
Oh, hold on, Lester.

1190
01:17:45,038 --> 01:17:45,851
Okay.

1191
01:17:45,871 --> 01:17:46,685
As most of you may know,

1192
01:17:46,705 --> 01:17:49,150
our fine mayor has a
direct line to the station,

1193
01:17:49,170 --> 01:17:50,793
and apparently he's calling right now

1194
01:17:50,813 --> 01:17:52,393
with an important message.

1195
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:57,997
Oh, hello, Mr. Mayor.

1196
01:17:58,017 --> 01:18:00,349
Katie, I'm afraid I have some bad news.

1197
01:18:00,369 --> 01:18:02,301
Convicted killer, Farley Wilder,

1198
01:18:02,321 --> 01:18:06,083
escaped from Manarmy Home
for the Criminally Insane.

1199
01:18:06,103 --> 01:18:08,920
Direct all citizens of
Morgantown stay in their homes,

1200
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:12,817
lock their doors, and remain
there until further notice.

1201
01:18:12,837 --> 01:18:15,808
The police force is on high alert.

1202
01:18:15,828 --> 01:18:17,190
Please continue to spread the word

1203
01:18:17,210 --> 01:18:19,059
to your listeners
throughout the night, Katie.

1204
01:18:21,231 --> 01:18:24,705
Do you understand me, Katie, Katie?

1205
01:18:27,363 --> 01:18:28,363
Katie!

1206
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:33,190
Hello, Morgantown, hello, Mr. Mayor,

1207
01:18:33,210 --> 01:18:35,570
and welcome to the first addition

1208
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:37,990
