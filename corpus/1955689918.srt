1
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,894
Some people might think
the moral of my story is.

2
00:00:50,645 --> 00:00:52,856
"In this fucked-up world,
even a simpie thing...

3
00:00:52,897 --> 00:00:55,734
"like buying a six-pack,
can be harmful to your health."

4
00:00:56,234 --> 00:00:58,111
But I don't know about that.

5
00:00:58,736 --> 00:01:01,156
What I do know is,
instead of getting our beer...

6
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:04,826
Joe and me got fucked-up terrorists
sticking a video camera in our faces...

7
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:06,911
for 36 days and 36 nights.

8
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:11,499
What we didn't know was that
everybody in America was watching.

9
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,593
Hi there. Cliff Spab, as seen on TV.

10
00:01:23,177 --> 00:01:24,470
I'm Wendy Pfister.

11
00:01:26,264 --> 00:01:30,143
Welcome to our humble home.
Come on in, take a seat.

12
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,355
We got apple pie in the oven,
and me and Joe are playing Crazy Eights.

13
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:36,607
Hey, we can deal you in if you want.

14
00:01:37,316 --> 00:01:38,693
I like Go Fish.

15
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:42,321
Wendy, what's for dinner?

16
00:01:44,907 --> 00:01:46,867
There's some Casa Blanca...

17
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:50,663
red-hot bean and beef burritos...

18
00:01:51,497 --> 00:01:56,585
some Pringles, some cupcakes
and a bag of gumnuts and...

19
00:01:58,212 --> 00:02:00,172
No, you ate the last bag of gumnuts.

20
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,591
No, I didn't.

21
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,843
You ate the last bag of gumnuts.

22
00:02:04,927 --> 00:02:08,597
- No, I didn't, Joe!
- All right, you two cut it out!

23
00:02:09,723 --> 00:02:12,935
You fucking bitch,
you ate the last bag of fucking gumnuts!

24
00:02:13,018 --> 00:02:15,354
I'm sick of you calling me a fucking bitch!

25
00:02:15,437 --> 00:02:17,815
- Wendy!
- I'm sick of it!

26
00:02:17,981 --> 00:02:21,610
- Let the dog in. Joe, take out the trash!
- Fuck the dog! Fuck the trash!

27
00:02:21,652 --> 00:02:25,113
No more backtalk from you,
young man, or you can forget dessert!

28
00:02:26,615 --> 00:02:27,825
Jesus Christ!

29
00:02:28,951 --> 00:02:32,704
When I was a young boy, I wouldn't
even think of talking the way you kids do.

30
00:02:33,163 --> 00:02:34,623
This is my house.

31
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:39,670
Since when is this your house?

32
00:02:39,836 --> 00:02:42,714
This just isn't my house,
it's my own fucking country!

33
00:02:44,508 --> 00:02:48,428
- I think I want an exit visa.
- Yeah, so fucking what, Wendy?

34
00:03:02,901 --> 00:03:03,985
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:05,945 --> 00:03:07,113
Wendy.

36
00:03:12,702 --> 00:03:13,620
Spab.

37
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:26,424
Hey, Wendy, Spab?

38
00:03:29,552 --> 00:03:31,179
How about another beer?

39
00:03:48,613 --> 00:03:52,158
- That's the last one, Joe.
- We'll just have to get some more, then.

40
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:55,786
No, I mean really, that's the last one.

41
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:00,082
Fuck.

42
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:03,210
Guess it's showtime! How you boys doing?

43
00:04:04,754 --> 00:04:06,422
How are they ever doing?

44
00:04:06,797 --> 00:04:09,592
Get that fucking camera off me!
Get the fuck off!

45
00:04:09,675 --> 00:04:12,094
Yeah, get it over here, man, right here!

46
00:04:12,136 --> 00:04:15,222
I got a treat for you boys.
This is for the folks back home!

47
00:04:15,306 --> 00:04:18,976
You ready to see
my really photogenic side? Well, here it is.

48
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:22,313
Give me the gun! Motherfucker!

49
00:06:58,634 --> 00:07:01,595
The Fun Stop hostage crisis is over.

50
00:07:02,262 --> 00:07:05,641
For 36 days, American television
was forced to broadcast...

51
00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:08,769
uncensored video tapes of five individuals...

52
00:07:08,852 --> 00:07:10,979
held by a terrorist group, Split Image.

53
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:15,484
If the uncensored tapes weren't aired,
all five hostages would die.

54
00:07:15,817 --> 00:07:17,778
A threat Split Image made good...

55
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:21,448
with the brutal killings
of Kim Martin and Milt Morris.

56
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,868
And so, every night
on prime-time television...

57
00:07:25,035 --> 00:07:28,121
we watched with agonized fascination
as the hostages...

58
00:07:28,538 --> 00:07:33,043
five ordinary Americans, were transformed
from convenience-store shoppers...

59
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:34,794
into national heroes.

60
00:07:34,961 --> 00:07:38,840
What the ultimate goal of Split Image was,
we may never know.

61
00:07:38,924 --> 00:07:41,509
Any further insight
may have to await the recovery...

62
00:07:41,593 --> 00:07:44,929
of the young man
we came to know so well, Cliff Spab.

63
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:49,768
At this moment, young Mr. Spab
is in a tightly guarded hospital room...

64
00:07:49,809 --> 00:07:53,521
recovering from the bullet wound
he suffered while risking his own life...

65
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:57,066
to save the only other surviving hostage,
Wendy Pfister.

66
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:00,987
We hope to have Cliff as our guest
as soon as his health permits.

67
00:08:18,463 --> 00:08:20,840
- How are you, Cliff?
- How the hell does he look?

68
00:08:20,882 --> 00:08:25,219
- You think you're up to a press conference?
- The President wants to give you a medal.

69
00:08:25,887 --> 00:08:28,139
- We're talking big time.
- At the White House.

70
00:08:28,181 --> 00:08:31,058
- Yes sir, we finally hit the jackpot!
- In the Rose Garden.

71
00:08:31,142 --> 00:08:34,312
Look, all that stuff I said
about you being a loser? Forget it.

72
00:08:34,353 --> 00:08:37,440
Your father has something very exciting
he wants to tell you.

73
00:08:37,523 --> 00:08:40,943
- Go ahead, Bob, tell him.
- It's just that your mom and-

74
00:08:41,027 --> 00:08:44,071
- Just spit it out!
- They're making a TV movie all about you.

75
00:08:44,155 --> 00:08:46,490
The Cliff Spab Story,
just the way it happened.

76
00:08:46,532 --> 00:08:50,286
Actually, they're making three TV movies.
Our version is the authorized one.

77
00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:52,413
The real McCoy. And check this out.

78
00:08:53,789 --> 00:08:55,082
I know how you feel.

79
00:08:56,709 --> 00:08:59,295
You don't have to talk if you don't want to.

80
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:06,802
Sometimes it feels better to talk about it.

81
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:13,642
Of course, sometimes,
it feels better not to talk about it.

82
00:09:13,892 --> 00:09:14,977
Agent Parsley.

83
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,271
FBI.

84
00:09:18,897 --> 00:09:22,609
You might have fooled the rest of the world,
but you don't fool me.

85
00:09:23,694 --> 00:09:26,405
I'm betting you were in on this little stunt.

86
00:09:28,282 --> 00:09:32,494
You're nothing but a foul-mouthed, lazy...

87
00:09:32,577 --> 00:09:36,289
good-for-nothing, little prick hoodlum...

88
00:09:36,373 --> 00:09:39,084
and the world would best be rid of you.

89
00:09:39,251 --> 00:09:42,671
The dark side of the Pepsi Generation.
That is you, all the way.

90
00:09:42,754 --> 00:09:44,881
They're offering you $1 million.

91
00:09:44,923 --> 00:09:47,634
- We're talking seven figures.
- That is a lot of money.

92
00:09:47,717 --> 00:09:50,887
We loved the way you handled yourself
on that TV special.

93
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:53,974
- Very smooth.
- He doesn't know about the TV special.

94
00:09:54,057 --> 00:09:57,811
- You don't know about the TV special?
- You had your own TV special.

95
00:09:57,894 --> 00:10:00,397
Don't worry about it. You were sensational!

96
00:10:00,438 --> 00:10:03,942
The best! Highest TVQ ever.
Better than a real star.

97
00:10:04,025 --> 00:10:06,736
The Cliff Spab Special. It got a 30 share.

98
00:10:07,195 --> 00:10:09,531
Even better than The Wendy Special.

99
00:10:10,406 --> 00:10:12,534
Ultimately, it's up to me.

100
00:10:12,617 --> 00:10:15,578
I haven't really found anybody...

101
00:10:17,121 --> 00:10:18,665
that can help me out.

102
00:10:20,124 --> 00:10:23,378
It's hard, because I don't think
people really understand...

103
00:10:23,878 --> 00:10:25,463
what I'm all about.

104
00:10:25,713 --> 00:10:29,258
You think they'll be a time
when you will want to look to the future...

105
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,304
and you will want to see
if things are gonna be brighter for you?

106
00:10:35,515 --> 00:10:37,016
I really don't know.

107
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,821
Hello.

108
00:10:55,618 --> 00:10:56,577
Hello?

109
00:11:11,884 --> 00:11:13,177
Don't touch me!

110
00:11:17,056 --> 00:11:20,100
What are you doing? Leave me alone!

111
00:11:20,351 --> 00:11:21,352
Help!

112
00:11:24,313 --> 00:11:25,773
Just take them.

113
00:11:29,526 --> 00:11:32,029
Fuck you, you fucking fuckheads!

114
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,167
Hey, Clifford!

115
00:11:46,418 --> 00:11:48,337
- How you doing, guy?
- Rocking!

116
00:11:49,004 --> 00:11:51,214
And there's more where that came from.

117
00:11:51,298 --> 00:11:53,508
- Best news I've had.
- Let's get outta here.

118
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:58,388
I want you to call me if you need to talk.
And, Cliff, watch your language.

119
00:11:59,848 --> 00:12:00,849
Who the hell is that?

120
00:12:00,932 --> 00:12:03,768
Beats the fuck out of me.
Hey, Scott, great shirt.

121
00:12:15,947 --> 00:12:17,782
Have you spoken to Wendy?

122
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,201
How is Wendy?

123
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:27,208
She took my beer.

124
00:12:28,293 --> 00:12:29,794
How are you feeling?

125
00:12:36,217 --> 00:12:37,385
How do you feel?

126
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,054
I don't know.

127
00:12:43,808 --> 00:12:45,310
James, let's motor!

128
00:12:48,229 --> 00:12:51,107
Fuck! What's the deal man?
What the fuck is going on here?

129
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:52,316
Get used to it.

130
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,695
These assholes kept dogging us for weeks.
You're a fucking hero.

131
00:12:55,778 --> 00:13:00,700
- What's that? Does it open up there?
- Yeah, that's a fucking bar, man.

132
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:04,120
- In-fucking-credible, baby!
- Got your coffee.

133
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:09,083
Clifford, there's gonna be some people
back at the house.

134
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,294
Some kind of reception shit.

135
00:13:12,795 --> 00:13:15,381
Limousine, primo beer. Can't beat it.

136
00:13:18,676 --> 00:13:22,930
Hey, Scott, let's go to the Boy.
James? To the Boy!

137
00:13:27,977 --> 00:13:31,355
Hey, Spab, we just saw you on TV.
You were great!

138
00:13:31,438 --> 00:13:34,149
- Really cool!
- Stan, hi.

139
00:13:34,483 --> 00:13:37,278
Anything you guys want
on the house, right?

140
00:13:38,028 --> 00:13:39,071
Check it out!

141
00:13:40,364 --> 00:13:42,032
No shit, 36 cents?

142
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,493
That's kind of cheap, Stan.

143
00:13:44,702 --> 00:13:47,329
It's symbolic. 36.

144
00:13:48,163 --> 00:13:49,832
Thirty-six days in the Fun Stop.

145
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,127
Pretty fucking clever, Stan.

146
00:13:55,003 --> 00:13:57,214
I just came to pick up my paycheck.

147
00:13:58,131 --> 00:14:01,009
Sure thing, Cliff.
I guess you were a little busy.

148
00:14:05,764 --> 00:14:06,890
Look, here.

149
00:14:11,895 --> 00:14:14,898
- Where's Joe, Stan?
- You're Worker of The Month.

150
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:20,153
I think Joe should be up here too,
don't you?

151
00:14:20,237 --> 00:14:23,198
- Well, Joe's dead.
- Come on, we gotta go, Cliff.

152
00:14:23,782 --> 00:14:25,700
Where the fuck is Joe, Stan?

153
00:14:26,201 --> 00:14:29,621
- You know he should fucking be up there.
- No can do.

154
00:14:30,538 --> 00:14:33,583
Hey Stan, you still spitting in the burgers
in this joint?

155
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:37,212
Very funny. You were always a joker.
Welcome back, Spab!

156
00:14:45,053 --> 00:14:48,389
I'm Wendy Pfister. I'm 17.

157
00:14:52,435 --> 00:14:54,687
I live in Ozell Park with my mom.

158
00:14:57,732 --> 00:14:59,359
And I go to Ozell Park High.

159
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:08,951
I just want my wife to know...

160
00:15:09,619 --> 00:15:11,120
I'm fine.

161
00:15:13,331 --> 00:15:15,583
These people don't frighten me.

162
00:15:17,168 --> 00:15:18,794
They are nothing.

163
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:28,554
My name is Kim Martin.

164
00:15:30,348 --> 00:15:34,518
I was working in this Fun Stop
when these people rushed in.

165
00:15:36,604 --> 00:15:38,272
I live in Royal Oak.

166
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:44,236
I have a husband and a son.

167
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,822
If you can hear me...

168
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,909
I love you so much.

169
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:57,082
Just keep on praying
that this will all be over really soon.

170
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,631
Get that fucking camera off me.

171
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:13,599
Say something.

172
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:16,101
Get him the fuck outta here.

173
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,523
Hi, my name is Rick Forsythe.

174
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:25,944
I live in Silver Pond with my parents,
George and Edna, and my sister, Suzanne.

175
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:29,281
I'm president of the debate team
and captain of my baseball team...

176
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:30,574
at Silver Pond High.

177
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,117
I have a dog named Rusty.

178
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,454
My hobbies include coin collecting
and dry-fucking cheerleaders.

179
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,336
He's here!

180
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:02,147
Come on, Cliff, I'll get you up here. Let's go!

181
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:49,902
On behalf of the city of Madison Heights,
I proclaim today...

182
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,363
Cliff Spab Day!

183
00:17:56,617 --> 00:18:00,621
And I'm pleased as punch
to present you with the key...

184
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,623
to our magnificent metropolis.

185
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,045
Who the fuck are you?

186
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,215
I'm the Mayor.

187
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:12,967
Right.

188
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,261
Thank you. It's a mighty big fucking key.

189
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:22,267
- Mr. Spab, have you seen Wendy Pfister?
- No, I haven't.

190
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,645
Can you describe what led to your freedom?

191
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:25,687
I can't.

192
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,898
You saved her life. Do you love her?

193
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,442
That's none of your business,
sweetheart, is it?

194
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,861
Any comment on the death of Joe Dice?

195
00:18:36,823 --> 00:18:39,910
Every one of you assholes
get the fuck out of here now!

196
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:46,541
Get these people off
my goddamn porch. Jesus!

197
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,377
What do we got here?

198
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,799
Tomorrow morning
you get your ass down to my office.

199
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:58,595
We're gonna have a little chat
about your Split Image friends.

200
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:02,224
They weren't my friends.
Get your fucking hands off me.

201
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,433
Back off, guy.

202
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:12,734
Cliff? Come in here. One, two, three.

203
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,195
Welcome home, Clifford!

204
00:19:15,695 --> 00:19:19,616
Cliff, your Aunt Jessica, Derrick and Sylvie
drove in from upstate...

205
00:19:19,657 --> 00:19:22,660
and your Uncle Jerry and Cousin Dave
took the bus.

206
00:19:22,702 --> 00:19:25,747
Right. Hey, there, how are you doing?

207
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,631
Clifford, honey, I cleaned your room.

208
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,970
- What the hell happened here?
- Mom.

209
00:19:42,221 --> 00:19:45,183
Fuck this shit! Give me a beer, Scott.

210
00:19:46,684 --> 00:19:47,810
Oh, baby.

211
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,698
So what are you gonna do now?

212
00:20:02,199 --> 00:20:03,326
Sing a song.

213
00:20:03,951 --> 00:20:07,204
Fucker boy outside

214
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:10,291
walking down the road

215
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:13,794
Fucker boy outside

216
00:20:13,878 --> 00:20:17,006
walking down the road

217
00:20:17,173 --> 00:20:21,927
Fucker boy outside walking down

218
00:20:22,428 --> 00:20:27,391
Walking down the road

219
00:20:29,852 --> 00:20:32,104
- That sucks, man.
- Yeah, you're right.

220
00:20:33,689 --> 00:20:36,567
I've been craving this
for so fucking long, man.

221
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,001
Turn that damn thing down!

222
00:21:43,174 --> 00:21:44,884
You guys out of your minds?

223
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,471
Yeah.

224
00:21:49,389 --> 00:21:52,850
You're a real comedian, Cliff.
I don't think this is very funny.

225
00:21:53,309 --> 00:21:54,227
I do.

226
00:21:54,435 --> 00:21:58,147
Now you listen to me.
There's a lot of money at stake here.

227
00:21:58,398 --> 00:22:02,735
I don't care if you fuck up your own life,
but don't fuck it up for your mom and me.

228
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:05,780
She'll be really pissed
when she sees what you've done here.

229
00:22:05,822 --> 00:22:09,117
I want to know one thing.
Who invited the fucking marching band?

230
00:22:09,158 --> 00:22:10,451
Watch your mouth!

231
00:22:10,535 --> 00:22:13,829
Mom and I are embarrassed as hell
about the language you used on TV.

232
00:22:13,913 --> 00:22:17,208
I bet you'd have been really embarrassed
if they blew my head off.

233
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:21,504
Yeah? You ain't leaving this house
until you give a press conference.

234
00:22:22,171 --> 00:22:23,255
Okay, Dad.

235
00:22:23,422 --> 00:22:26,967
I think I know how to stay in confined areas
for long periods of time.

236
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,012
Shut up, Scott! You little twerp.

237
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,724
A press conference will not kill you.

238
00:22:33,891 --> 00:22:37,895
Joe thought running into the Fun Stop
to buy some beer wouldn't kill him either.

239
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,981
Don't fuck with me, Cliff.

240
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:45,861
And clean up this fucking room.

241
00:22:49,365 --> 00:22:50,699
Home, sweet home.

242
00:22:52,284 --> 00:22:53,410
Hey, Wendy.

243
00:22:54,203 --> 00:22:55,079
Spab.

244
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,170
Let's sing a duet, shall we?

245
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:13,222
As long as we got each other

246
00:23:15,724 --> 00:23:20,729
We got the world spinnin' right in our hands

247
00:23:22,397 --> 00:23:24,483
Baby you and me

248
00:23:26,151 --> 00:23:27,861
we gotta be

249
00:23:29,488 --> 00:23:32,365
The luckiest dreamers

250
00:23:32,574 --> 00:23:35,076
who never quit dreamin'

251
00:23:36,411 --> 00:23:40,540
As long as we keep on givin'

252
00:23:42,918 --> 00:23:47,213
we can take anything that comes our way

253
00:23:48,256 --> 00:23:50,925
Baby, rain or shine

254
00:23:51,926 --> 00:23:53,887
all the time

255
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,516
We got each other

256
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,186
Sharing the laughter and love

257
00:24:03,438 --> 00:24:04,522
Come here.

258
00:24:16,326 --> 00:24:17,910
I want to go home.

259
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:30,965
- What's the deal?
- What do you think the deal is, Spab?

260
00:24:31,132 --> 00:24:33,926
- Do you want to take a bath?
- Fuck you, Spab.

261
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:37,763
My brother's dead and all you can say is,
"You want to take a bath?"

262
00:24:37,805 --> 00:24:39,807
Monica, I'm coming over.

263
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:42,435
Spab, you asshole.

264
00:25:15,467 --> 00:25:17,636
I was 1 year old when Joe was born.

265
00:25:18,345 --> 00:25:22,683
And for the next 19 years, we lived
next door to each other in Madison Heights.

266
00:25:23,183 --> 00:25:26,854
Went to the same schools,
worked at the same goddamn Burger Boy.

267
00:25:28,021 --> 00:25:32,192
Spent countless hours drinking Bullseye
and getting fucked up on cheap pot.

268
00:25:34,403 --> 00:25:35,904
And now Joe's dead.

269
00:25:37,656 --> 00:25:39,241
What a fucking waste.

270
00:25:54,047 --> 00:25:55,674
I've gone nuts, Monica.

271
00:25:57,259 --> 00:25:59,386
I thought it was crazy in there...

272
00:26:00,262 --> 00:26:01,596
but out here...

273
00:26:02,389 --> 00:26:04,015
it's fucking insane.

274
00:26:05,225 --> 00:26:06,726
Yeah, so?

275
00:26:07,894 --> 00:26:09,688
Fuck being drunk or stoned.

276
00:26:11,147 --> 00:26:13,358
In that goddamn store, we were nuts.

277
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,026
Even Wendy?

278
00:26:16,236 --> 00:26:18,780
Yeah, even Wendy, she was nuts.

279
00:26:24,577 --> 00:26:26,120
So, did you fuck her?

280
00:26:26,746 --> 00:26:28,373
Who, Wendy?

281
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:31,709
Wendy Pfister?

282
00:26:33,336 --> 00:26:36,714
I didn't even know the girl, you know,
before all this shit went down.

283
00:26:37,298 --> 00:26:40,301
She was just in the wrong place
at the wrong time, you know.

284
00:26:40,384 --> 00:26:43,054
You're good, Spab, you're really good.

285
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:47,558
I'd say I know you, but every now and then
you leave me guessing.

286
00:26:49,477 --> 00:26:50,853
Did Joe fuck her?

287
00:26:51,854 --> 00:26:53,147
What do you think?

288
00:26:56,359 --> 00:27:00,154
You asshole, you like her, don't you?
Christ, I can tell.

289
00:27:00,237 --> 00:27:04,200
What have you got against Wendy Pfister?
I mean, she's a really nice girl.

290
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:09,997
I don't know,
maybe her little Miss Teen USA act.

291
00:27:10,289 --> 00:27:12,917
You can do what she does
and get away with it...

292
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,461
and never feel guilty
about it if you wanted to.

293
00:27:15,503 --> 00:27:17,463
Maybe, but who'd want to.

294
00:27:18,422 --> 00:27:20,716
Monica, you fucking taco, I know you.

295
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:26,055
Take your bath, Spab.

296
00:27:37,107 --> 00:27:38,317
You need one.

297
00:28:24,696 --> 00:28:26,406
What's the deal, Monica?

298
00:28:28,283 --> 00:28:30,201
What do you think the deal is?

299
00:28:34,622 --> 00:28:36,207
All right, come on in.

300
00:28:49,971 --> 00:28:51,472
It's pretty pathetic.

301
00:28:53,891 --> 00:28:55,643
You ought to see my room.

302
00:28:56,477 --> 00:28:59,522
Fuck your room! You ain't dead.

303
00:29:05,486 --> 00:29:09,824
They forgot about Joe the minute
they had you to honor, praise and interview.

304
00:29:11,284 --> 00:29:13,911
Yeah, like they won't forget about me.

305
00:29:16,163 --> 00:29:18,416
I'm not saying it's your fault, Spab.

306
00:29:20,376 --> 00:29:24,046
I'm just saying they were never
all that interested in Joe anyway.

307
00:29:25,923 --> 00:29:29,301
Joe wasn't funny enough.
Joe wasn't interesting enough.

308
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:32,638
He never came up
with all the good lines you did.

309
00:29:35,391 --> 00:29:36,934
Don't you get it?

310
00:29:40,187 --> 00:29:43,732
You were the guy that everybody
wanted to know everything about.

311
00:29:44,692 --> 00:29:46,193
Not my brother.

312
00:29:47,111 --> 00:29:48,654
Well, fuck everybody.

313
00:29:49,071 --> 00:29:52,616
Tell them that,
and it's just another fucking headline.

314
00:29:55,744 --> 00:29:57,246
God, I'm drunk.

315
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:05,254
What time is it, anyway?

316
00:30:07,965 --> 00:30:09,466
I don't know. 1:30?

317
00:30:12,469 --> 00:30:13,929
God, I'm sorry.

318
00:30:16,306 --> 00:30:17,808
Don't be sorry.

319
00:30:19,643 --> 00:30:22,312
I've been drunk since May 2. It's no big deal.

320
00:30:22,395 --> 00:30:23,480
Yeah.

321
00:30:23,647 --> 00:30:26,399
But you know me. I'm usually in control.

322
00:30:39,746 --> 00:30:40,955
Monica?

323
00:30:45,335 --> 00:30:46,711
What's the deal?

324
00:30:47,337 --> 00:30:48,505
Jesus, Spab!

325
00:30:49,255 --> 00:30:50,757
You fucking asshole.

326
00:32:32,941 --> 00:32:34,693
How long are you gonna be gone?

327
00:32:34,776 --> 00:32:36,737
Well, you know me, honey.

328
00:32:37,154 --> 00:32:38,989
Rocking and rolling...

329
00:32:39,072 --> 00:32:41,032
taking care of business, sweet thing.

330
00:32:41,116 --> 00:32:44,452
Yep, I know what you mean.
Running with life, your back to the winds.

331
00:32:44,536 --> 00:32:46,830
Yeah, you know what I'm saying.

332
00:32:47,497 --> 00:32:50,083
And don't call me "sweet thing,"
you fucking asshole.

333
00:33:05,181 --> 00:33:07,851
- Thanks for the lift.
- Is that what you call it?

334
00:33:13,398 --> 00:33:15,692
Here, this might help out some.

335
00:33:17,193 --> 00:33:18,736
You didn't have to do that.

336
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,489
Ever heard of Friends of the Hostages?

337
00:33:21,572 --> 00:33:25,118
People we don't even know have been
sending us money for weeks now.

338
00:33:25,201 --> 00:33:26,744
Call if you want more.

339
00:33:26,828 --> 00:33:29,330
What if I don't want more, but I want to call?

340
00:33:29,372 --> 00:33:31,999
Like I said, call if you want more.

341
00:33:35,378 --> 00:33:37,171
Good luck being nobody!

342
00:33:53,896 --> 00:33:55,606
Holy shit, man, it's Spab!

343
00:33:57,692 --> 00:34:01,195
Hey, Spab, I'm not a fuckup.
I just play one in real life.

344
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:04,657
Hey, what's the deal, guys?

345
00:34:04,698 --> 00:34:06,784
Hey, you want to puff this fatty, man?

346
00:34:07,535 --> 00:34:08,744
Thank you, boys.

347
00:34:09,537 --> 00:34:12,164
Fucking Spab, fucking psychedelic!

348
00:34:12,206 --> 00:34:15,251
I'm Al, this is Johnny!

349
00:34:15,376 --> 00:34:16,418
Cliff.

350
00:34:17,127 --> 00:34:19,213
You look fatter on TV, man.

351
00:34:20,089 --> 00:34:23,217
I can't believe I'm standing here,
talking to Cliff Spab!

352
00:34:23,384 --> 00:34:24,677
Ask him something!

353
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,011
Like what, man?

354
00:34:26,095 --> 00:34:27,971
I don't know, ask him about his arm.

355
00:34:28,055 --> 00:34:31,433
- What happened to his arm?
- He got shot, you dufus.

356
00:34:31,517 --> 00:34:33,227
Fuck! In the arm?

357
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,895
No, in the shoulder, man.

358
00:34:34,978 --> 00:34:37,314
- Well, did it hurt?
- Yeah, it fucking hurt.

359
00:34:37,731 --> 00:34:39,816
Man, that must've sucked.

360
00:34:41,193 --> 00:34:42,903
So, how's Joe, man?

361
00:34:46,031 --> 00:34:48,075
- Fuck, I forgot.
- I'm sorry.

362
00:34:48,158 --> 00:34:50,702
God, Joe's dead!

363
00:34:51,703 --> 00:34:52,788
I'm sorry.

364
00:34:52,871 --> 00:34:54,539
It's all right, man.

365
00:35:04,925 --> 00:35:06,509
Well, that's my ride.

366
00:35:07,636 --> 00:35:09,221
Where you going?

367
00:35:11,139 --> 00:35:13,892
If it isn't Rick fucking Forsythe.

368
00:35:14,392 --> 00:35:16,728
Hey, Morrow, you fucking asshole.

369
00:35:16,811 --> 00:35:18,855
How's the cheerleaders, Rick?

370
00:35:18,938 --> 00:35:20,815
Hey, Spab, you coming back?

371
00:35:21,274 --> 00:35:22,442
Never.

372
00:35:23,485 --> 00:35:25,612
Kids today, let me tell you.

373
00:35:27,614 --> 00:35:28,615
Onward!

374
00:35:41,085 --> 00:35:43,546
Shit, that was Spab.

375
00:35:43,629 --> 00:35:46,341
Shit, man, he took our joint!

376
00:35:47,717 --> 00:35:49,218
You have our joint!

377
00:35:51,095 --> 00:35:54,098
I rolled it myself!

378
00:36:04,609 --> 00:36:06,235
Who was that, your fan club?

379
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:09,113
That was Joe and me three years ago.

380
00:36:09,155 --> 00:36:11,657
So how does it feel to be famous?

381
00:36:12,825 --> 00:36:15,327
It feels angry, man.

382
00:36:17,872 --> 00:36:21,125
The curiosity about Cliff Spab
throughout the country...

383
00:36:21,208 --> 00:36:24,295
has been overwhelming.
He's now bordering on cult status.

384
00:36:24,378 --> 00:36:28,549
- Hang on. Yes, ma'am, right here.
- What's Cliff Spab really like?

385
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,385
Exactly like he was on those tapes.

386
00:36:31,927 --> 00:36:35,639
Reality programming
gives reality a bad fucking name.

387
00:36:35,681 --> 00:36:36,890
What do you think?

388
00:36:36,974 --> 00:36:40,686
He's a lazy, foul-mouthed,
uneducated drug addict.

389
00:36:43,731 --> 00:36:45,274
This guy's funny.

390
00:36:45,357 --> 00:36:48,444
Wendy, you met Cliff Spab at the Fun Stop.

391
00:36:48,986 --> 00:36:50,946
He's from working-class Madison Heights.

392
00:36:51,029 --> 00:36:53,949
You're from the wealthy suburb
of Ozell Park.

393
00:36:54,199 --> 00:36:57,911
Bottom line. ' you and Cliff
are very different people, aren't you?

394
00:36:57,995 --> 00:36:59,454
In what ways?

395
00:37:00,205 --> 00:37:01,915
I don't think we're that different.

396
00:37:02,791 --> 00:37:04,418
Wendy looks good!

397
00:37:05,711 --> 00:37:07,045
I'd do her.

398
00:37:07,212 --> 00:37:09,631
But you're perceived differently.

399
00:37:09,798 --> 00:37:12,676
That's what this is all about anyway, isn't it?

400
00:37:12,718 --> 00:37:14,136
Perceptions.

401
00:37:14,886 --> 00:37:17,180
I don't think people know Spab or me.

402
00:37:17,264 --> 00:37:18,765
Did you fuck her?

403
00:37:18,849 --> 00:37:21,935
- With the handcuffs and everything.
- All right, shut up, Morrow.

404
00:37:22,018 --> 00:37:24,729
They may think they know us,
but they don't know us at all.

405
00:37:24,813 --> 00:37:27,524
Okay Wendy, I gotta ask you this:

406
00:37:27,607 --> 00:37:29,526
Where is Cliff Spab?

407
00:37:29,567 --> 00:37:31,653
I know! Here!

408
00:37:31,736 --> 00:37:35,031
Indeed, all of America is wondering
where is Cliff Spab?

409
00:37:35,115 --> 00:37:39,160
Where can he be? Is he on the road,
or has foul play befallen him?

410
00:37:41,913 --> 00:37:43,498
Hang on.

411
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:48,545
If I was Wendy, and I knew where Spab is,
I would never tell anybody.

412
00:37:57,762 --> 00:38:00,932
Initially no network would air
the hostage tapes.

413
00:38:01,265 --> 00:38:05,728
But after the cold-blooded executions
of hostages Kim Martin and Milt Morris...

414
00:38:05,812 --> 00:38:09,774
the networks had no choice.
And all over the world, every night...

415
00:38:09,857 --> 00:38:13,653
Cliff Spab and Wendy Pfister
became part of our lives.

416
00:38:13,861 --> 00:38:18,199
Thursday, June 17.
Viewer discretion is advised.

417
00:38:24,163 --> 00:38:27,208
Will you cut it out. I can't take it anymore!

418
00:38:27,291 --> 00:38:28,584
All right, listen up.

419
00:38:30,753 --> 00:38:33,798
There's been some developments.
We're gonna let one of you go.

420
00:38:33,881 --> 00:38:36,300
All right! I just want to say,
on my own behalf...

421
00:38:36,383 --> 00:38:38,677
how great it's been
hanging out with you guys.

422
00:38:38,761 --> 00:38:40,596
Who wants to let this guy go?

423
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:41,889
Sit down...

424
00:38:41,972 --> 00:38:43,641
Watch the language!

425
00:38:45,976 --> 00:38:47,436
Why don't you let her go?

426
00:38:47,478 --> 00:38:49,104
How many for her?

427
00:38:49,313 --> 00:38:51,273
Get her out of here, man.

428
00:38:52,024 --> 00:38:53,525
Oh, thank God!

429
00:38:54,902 --> 00:38:56,236
I'll pray for you.

430
00:38:57,738 --> 00:38:59,948
I'll pray for all of you guys.

431
00:39:02,451 --> 00:39:06,830
Yeah, we're gonna miss you, Kim!
It ain't gonna be the same without you!

432
00:39:46,828 --> 00:39:48,913
Let's get out of here, man.

433
00:39:53,293 --> 00:39:54,669
Crestridge?

434
00:39:54,878 --> 00:39:58,506
What are you taking me here for, man?
I don't want to see anybody.

435
00:40:02,802 --> 00:40:05,680
Don't worry, guy,
your 15 minutes are almost up.

436
00:40:21,654 --> 00:40:23,614
Morrow, what's the deal?

437
00:40:25,116 --> 00:40:26,534
What's the deal?

438
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:31,247
You mean, what am I sure of?

439
00:40:32,707 --> 00:40:36,168
The one thing I'm sure of
is that everything is unsure.

440
00:42:16,643 --> 00:42:17,894
Fuck you!

441
00:42:23,942 --> 00:42:25,818
What's the point of saying anything?

442
00:42:28,863 --> 00:42:32,367
You know how it is, man.
It's the same old fucking shit.

443
00:42:34,661 --> 00:42:35,745
So...

444
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:40,750
I'm stuck in this Fun Stop.

445
00:42:49,008 --> 00:42:50,593
So fucking what?

446
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,015
And I'm bored as shit.

447
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:00,561
So fucking what?

448
00:43:03,064 --> 00:43:05,524
So I don't know what the fuck's going on?

449
00:43:06,525 --> 00:43:08,110
So fucking what?

450
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,240
So I might die in here.

451
00:43:21,582 --> 00:43:23,167
So fucking what?

452
00:43:26,253 --> 00:43:29,256
So I haven't had a decent shower and food...

453
00:43:29,882 --> 00:43:31,842
in way too fucking long.

454
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:35,971
So fucking what?

455
00:43:38,307 --> 00:43:40,058
How is this different...

456
00:43:42,102 --> 00:43:44,396
from anything else
that's happened in my life?

457
00:43:46,398 --> 00:43:50,235
I mean, God, when I was in high school,
fucking up big time...

458
00:43:51,445 --> 00:43:54,072
everybody was always giving me shit.

459
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,286
All I ever said was, "So fucking what?"

460
00:44:01,955 --> 00:44:04,624
When I was at the Boy, the goddamn Boy...

461
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:08,670
making minimum
after working there for three years, man...

462
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:14,676
all I ever said was, "So fucking what?"

463
00:44:16,344 --> 00:44:17,804
Jesus Christ!

464
00:44:20,098 --> 00:44:21,766
That's all you gotta do, man.

465
00:44:24,311 --> 00:44:27,605
It's all everybody's gotta do,
is just say, "So fucking what?"

466
00:44:30,066 --> 00:44:31,693
It works wonders.

467
00:44:33,319 --> 00:44:34,571
Trust me.

468
00:44:35,864 --> 00:44:37,073
I know.

469
00:44:46,958 --> 00:44:48,459
So go ahead.

470
00:44:49,836 --> 00:44:51,504
Go ahead, Mr. Cameraman.

471
00:44:51,587 --> 00:44:53,464
Everybody out there...

472
00:44:54,674 --> 00:44:57,093
say it along with me. ' "So fucking what?"

473
00:44:57,176 --> 00:45:00,513
You must think
you're real fucking funny, don't you?

474
00:45:00,596 --> 00:45:02,640
- What are you doing, Morrow?
- Just wait.

475
00:45:02,723 --> 00:45:05,476
- Wait for me in the car!
- I don't want to wait for you.

476
00:45:05,518 --> 00:45:07,645
Wait for me in the... Get outta here!

477
00:45:07,728 --> 00:45:10,481
Do me a favor?
Would you hold onto this for me?

478
00:45:10,523 --> 00:45:12,400
What the fuck are you doing, man?

479
00:45:12,483 --> 00:45:14,860
You think that guy
broke your fucking window?

480
00:45:14,944 --> 00:45:17,530
So you take his gun?
What are you, a fucking idiot?

481
00:45:17,613 --> 00:45:18,614
Fuck you!

482
00:45:18,698 --> 00:45:20,992
What do you mean "fuck you"?
Fuck you, man.

483
00:45:24,829 --> 00:45:27,415
Just because you're a big, fucking hero...

484
00:45:27,498 --> 00:45:30,167
does not mean you know jack shit
about the real world.

485
00:45:30,251 --> 00:45:31,502
- You know what?
- What?

486
00:45:31,585 --> 00:45:35,339
Take me to the bus depot,
and don't be laughing at me, you prick!

487
00:45:35,422 --> 00:45:37,883
We interrupt to bring you
a special news bulletin.

488
00:45:37,967 --> 00:45:40,427
Reports are in
that Cliff Spab has been sighted...

489
00:45:40,511 --> 00:45:42,680
at the Crestridge Mall in Madison Heights.

490
00:45:42,721 --> 00:45:45,766
According to FBI agent, Gerald Parsley,
the hunt for Spab...

491
00:45:45,849 --> 00:45:49,645
is being confined to Madison Heights.
Agent Parsley had this to say. '

492
00:45:49,728 --> 00:45:52,523
Mr. Spab is being sought for questioning.

493
00:45:52,898 --> 00:45:56,819
We believe he has been, and still is,
involved with certain subversive activities.

494
00:45:56,902 --> 00:45:58,362
This fucking guy!

495
00:45:58,404 --> 00:46:00,697
We know he has not left
the immediate area...

496
00:46:00,781 --> 00:46:04,701
and a search of his most likely destinations
is now in progress.

497
00:46:04,743 --> 00:46:07,037
Cliff, this is your mother.

498
00:46:07,579 --> 00:46:10,207
We want you to come home. We love you.

499
00:46:10,916 --> 00:46:12,042
Fuck!

500
00:46:16,254 --> 00:46:17,464
Sandy!

501
00:46:23,261 --> 00:46:24,721
Come check this out.

502
00:46:28,517 --> 00:46:30,268
Sandy's drunk again!

503
00:46:30,769 --> 00:46:32,395
Goddamn it, I hate that shit!

504
00:46:33,146 --> 00:46:35,690
Come here.
Help me take her to the bathroom.

505
00:46:35,774 --> 00:46:37,067
Grab her legs.

506
00:46:39,986 --> 00:46:42,238
Let's get the fuck out of here, all right?

507
00:46:44,115 --> 00:46:46,826
Come on,
just help me take her to the bathroom.

508
00:46:47,452 --> 00:46:48,661
Sandy

509
00:46:49,788 --> 00:46:52,415
how I love you, Sandy

510
00:46:56,085 --> 00:46:57,837
Rise and shine, darling.

511
00:46:59,047 --> 00:47:00,256
Oh, God.

512
00:47:00,423 --> 00:47:02,258
No, it's Morrow, honey.

513
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:05,094
Get your fucking hands off of me.
And who's that?

514
00:47:06,054 --> 00:47:07,096
Him?

515
00:47:07,347 --> 00:47:08,598
He's Fred Nietzsche.

516
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,099
Get your hands off of me!

517
00:47:10,141 --> 00:47:12,518
You gotta be careful,
a woman in your condition.

518
00:47:12,602 --> 00:47:14,187
Fuck you, Morrow!

519
00:47:29,285 --> 00:47:32,538
Mrs. Pfister,
I really need to talk to Wendy, okay?

520
00:47:33,456 --> 00:47:36,417
Cliff, look, I realize you've both
been through a lot...

521
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:40,588
but I don't think it's a good idea for
you and Wendy to see each other anymore.

522
00:47:40,671 --> 00:47:42,506
I've told Wendy this, too.

523
00:47:46,886 --> 00:47:48,053
Hello?

524
00:47:48,345 --> 00:47:49,805
Mrs. Pfister?

525
00:47:50,431 --> 00:47:51,974
I'm sorry, Cliff.

526
00:48:00,024 --> 00:48:04,153
Hey, Cliff, bring us another bottle
of that shit champagne!

527
00:48:31,471 --> 00:48:34,933
- Hey, guy, listen to this.
- Do I have to?

528
00:48:35,309 --> 00:48:37,936
Suppose, instead of going to
the local Fun Stop...

529
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:40,355
with your two best friends
to buy some beer...

530
00:48:40,397 --> 00:48:43,233
you go out
with a woman named Sandy Hooten.

531
00:48:44,067 --> 00:48:45,694
Yeah, I remember.

532
00:48:46,361 --> 00:48:49,364
Suppose, while your two best friends
are being taken hostage...

533
00:48:49,447 --> 00:48:53,702
by some insane freaks, you make love
to the aforementioned Sandy Hooten...

534
00:48:53,785 --> 00:48:55,704
who tells you she's on the pill...

535
00:48:55,787 --> 00:48:58,331
so you don't have to use
a latex prophylactic device.

536
00:48:58,415 --> 00:49:01,042
- Morrow, shut up.
- Yeah, please, Morrow-

537
00:49:01,126 --> 00:49:04,045
And further suppose,
after a few weeks go by...

538
00:49:04,129 --> 00:49:06,840
the aforementioned,
Sandy Hooten returns...

539
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:20,520
It's $300 to be exact.

540
00:49:20,603 --> 00:49:25,650
You fucking liar, you gave me $228.

541
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:29,445
- And finally-
- Finish the fucking story already. Jesus.

542
00:49:29,529 --> 00:49:32,198
Your two best friends
are still being held hostage...

543
00:49:32,281 --> 00:49:36,202
by the aforementioned insane freaks,
in the aforementioned Fun Stop.

544
00:49:36,285 --> 00:49:39,163
You hop over to see the aforementioned
mother of your child.

545
00:49:39,247 --> 00:49:42,667
And you happen to discover
that she was on the pill!

546
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:44,460
She never got pregnant.

547
00:49:44,794 --> 00:49:47,338
She only needed the aforementioned $300...

548
00:49:47,421 --> 00:49:51,133
to buy this cheap-ass, shit-fucking wine,
because she's a fucking drunk!

549
00:49:54,804 --> 00:49:57,181
What the fuck are you doing?
Give me the gun.

550
00:49:57,264 --> 00:49:58,557
Back off, cowboy!

551
00:49:58,641 --> 00:50:02,061
I can't believe this.
Now you're fucking pointing a gun at me.

552
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,939
Stand up, honey. Stand up, Sandy!

553
00:50:08,692 --> 00:50:11,195
Sandy, I love you.

554
00:50:19,411 --> 00:50:20,788
You're Spab!

555
00:50:23,999 --> 00:50:25,209
Yeah, well-

556
00:50:26,085 --> 00:50:29,421
No, really, I love you.
I've seen all your tapes.

557
00:50:30,506 --> 00:50:34,051
- This is-
- No, this is an honor, is what it is.

558
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,470
I'll be honest with you, Cliff.

559
00:50:36,595 --> 00:50:39,014
You and your philosophy, and stuff?

560
00:50:40,015 --> 00:50:42,309
You helped me through
some pretty tough times.

561
00:50:42,893 --> 00:50:44,603
I wish you could help him.

562
00:50:44,686 --> 00:50:47,272
Let's get out of here before I puke!

563
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:52,319
All right. Shine on, little diamond.

564
00:50:54,571 --> 00:50:55,947
Bye, Sandy.

565
00:51:01,036 --> 00:51:02,871
So fucking what?

566
00:51:08,877 --> 00:51:10,503
So fucking what?

567
00:51:14,382 --> 00:51:16,384
Why are we still in here?

568
00:51:17,344 --> 00:51:19,929
How long have we been in here anyway?

569
00:51:21,723 --> 00:51:23,850
You're not gonna tell me.

570
00:51:24,434 --> 00:51:25,685
Fuck you!

571
00:51:29,814 --> 00:51:32,400
You want to shoot somebody? Shoot me.

572
00:51:34,235 --> 00:51:37,822
Go ahead. You got the camera,
you got the gun. Do it.

573
00:51:38,489 --> 00:51:40,950
You know, you run out of hostages,
you're fucked!

574
00:51:41,034 --> 00:51:42,493
You know that?

575
00:51:42,744 --> 00:51:45,705
You see, that's the difference
between you assholes and me.

576
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:48,166
You're afraid of dying. I'm not.

577
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,210
I'm not afraid to die.

578
00:51:52,086 --> 00:51:53,713
So, fucking do it!

579
00:51:54,756 --> 00:51:58,217
I am fucking daring you
to shoot me in the head!

580
00:51:59,135 --> 00:52:00,678
Fucking do it!

581
00:52:00,761 --> 00:52:02,722
You think I give a fuck?

582
00:52:02,763 --> 00:52:05,558
I don't give a fuck! I could give two shits!

583
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,769
Fucking kill me!
Shoot me in the fucking head, you fuck!

584
00:52:08,853 --> 00:52:11,689
You sorry-ass, cock-sucking motherfucker!

585
00:52:27,329 --> 00:52:28,581
Fuck you.

586
00:53:23,969 --> 00:53:26,137
Shit, Morrow, come on in.

587
00:53:33,061 --> 00:53:35,105
What did you do now, little brother?

588
00:53:36,272 --> 00:53:38,650
Janet, I'd like you to meet Spab.

589
00:53:39,109 --> 00:53:42,070
- Spab, this is my sister.
- No kidding?

590
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:46,699
Hey, I'm splitting.
I've had it with this two-bit town.

591
00:53:47,992 --> 00:53:50,995
I want you to tell her everything.
Don't leave nothing out.

592
00:53:51,079 --> 00:53:53,373
Janet here is a goddamn lawyer.

593
00:53:54,666 --> 00:53:57,377
Janet, could you
take care of this for me, please?

594
00:54:03,466 --> 00:54:04,968
Hey, guy, remember...

595
00:54:06,469 --> 00:54:09,472
the best you can expect
is to avoid the worst.

596
00:54:15,937 --> 00:54:18,689
- Present.
- As in, the Spab?

597
00:54:18,773 --> 00:54:20,358
Yeah, afraid so.

598
00:54:27,323 --> 00:54:29,200
Morrow never told me...

599
00:54:30,326 --> 00:54:31,535
he had a sister.

600
00:54:32,787 --> 00:54:34,664
Morrow never told me he had a Spab.

601
00:54:37,666 --> 00:54:40,002
Wendy Pfister,
the courageous young woman...

602
00:54:40,086 --> 00:54:41,879
we came to care about so deeply...

603
00:54:41,962 --> 00:54:44,215
has been through more
in the last several months...

604
00:54:44,298 --> 00:54:46,717
than most of us will experience in a lifetime.

605
00:54:46,759 --> 00:54:50,888
But through it all she retained her dignity,
refusing to be reduced to the level...

606
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:52,514
of her mysterious captors.

607
00:54:52,598 --> 00:54:54,975
When she emerged from her terrible ordeal...

608
00:54:55,059 --> 00:54:56,727
she found herself strengthened.

609
00:54:56,769 --> 00:55:01,190
She discovered an iron will and a newfound
sensitivity to the needs of others.

610
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:03,942
In short, Wendy Pfister
has been transformed...

611
00:55:04,026 --> 00:55:08,072
from a typical American teenager
into a genuine American heroine.

612
00:55:09,281 --> 00:55:12,910
Tonight, for the first time,
we'll get to spend an hour with Wendy...

613
00:55:12,993 --> 00:55:15,287
in the privacy of her own home.

614
00:55:16,914 --> 00:55:20,417
What about Cliff Spab?
What are your impressions of him?

615
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,294
Her hair is terrible.

616
00:55:22,544 --> 00:55:24,421
I think she looks good.

617
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:26,340
Really?

618
00:55:27,132 --> 00:55:29,926
I've been really careful
with what I say about Spab.

619
00:55:29,968 --> 00:55:31,053
Why?

620
00:55:33,722 --> 00:55:35,682
Because people don't understand him.

621
00:55:36,933 --> 00:55:40,645
And you have to know him
to really know what he's all about.

622
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:44,232
Would you like to see Spab again?
Could you be friends?

623
00:55:44,858 --> 00:55:47,068
I think we still are friends.

624
00:55:50,363 --> 00:55:52,782
Sure, I'd like to know how he's doing.

625
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:55,285
You don't spend
so much time with someone...

626
00:55:55,368 --> 00:55:58,955
and not find out almost everything
about each other's lives.

627
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:05,295
I really miss him.

628
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:11,593
He saved my life.

629
00:56:16,347 --> 00:56:18,349
That girl is cracking up.

630
00:56:20,893 --> 00:56:23,813
I personally don't think
she's getting very good advice.

631
00:56:23,896 --> 00:56:25,106
Really?

632
00:56:25,773 --> 00:56:28,276
And what advice would you give her?

633
00:56:35,616 --> 00:56:37,118
First of all...

634
00:56:39,495 --> 00:56:41,497
I would tell her to relax.

635
00:56:44,166 --> 00:56:47,336
And then I would advise her...

636
00:56:47,378 --> 00:56:49,005
to have some fun.

637
00:56:52,341 --> 00:56:55,344
And then I would tell her...

638
00:56:56,053 --> 00:57:00,641
to laugh all the way to the bank.

639
00:57:10,776 --> 00:57:12,152
Here it is.

640
00:57:17,241 --> 00:57:20,285
Okay, I'm going to commit
a little felony here.

641
00:57:20,786 --> 00:57:23,038
How's your pitching arm, Spab?

642
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,605
Who are you, Clifford Spab?

643
00:57:49,356 --> 00:57:52,984
Just some greasy-ass white boy
from the northeast suburbs.

644
00:58:04,621 --> 00:58:05,789
Hello!

645
00:58:24,682 --> 00:58:27,227
It's sure been an interesting night.

646
00:58:27,769 --> 00:58:30,522
The night's still young, and so are you.

647
00:58:33,608 --> 00:58:37,278
If you need a place to lay low,
I'll protect your privacy.

648
00:58:38,821 --> 00:58:40,156
Thank you.

649
00:58:41,658 --> 00:58:44,869
But when you're ready,
I'll be ready with you.

650
00:58:44,952 --> 00:58:46,412
That's great.

651
00:58:46,913 --> 00:58:48,122
Ready...

652
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:50,291
Ready for what?

653
00:58:51,334 --> 00:58:54,086
One of these days
you'll want to get your life back...

654
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:57,131
and you may have to sue some people
to get it.

655
00:58:58,341 --> 00:59:00,801
They can all just fuck themselves.

656
00:59:02,887 --> 00:59:05,139
We all would like that, Spab...

657
00:59:05,348 --> 00:59:09,143
but experience has taught me that people
just don't up and fuck themselves.

658
00:59:10,186 --> 00:59:12,688
They need somebody else to fuck them.

659
00:59:12,772 --> 00:59:16,275
And that's why God created lawyers like me.

660
00:59:17,568 --> 00:59:19,737
And that's why Morrow brought you here.

661
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:21,280
This was Morrow's idea?

662
00:59:22,031 --> 00:59:25,326
I mean, you guys
are gonna split the profits, right?

663
00:59:26,118 --> 00:59:28,829
Actually we will only split 50 percent.

664
00:59:28,871 --> 00:59:31,290
- The other 50 goes to you.
- Right.

665
00:59:37,046 --> 00:59:38,797
Where are you going?

666
00:59:39,506 --> 00:59:43,343
Come on, Spab, it's a total spinout.
You need to take control.

667
00:59:43,761 --> 00:59:46,054
I'm willing to negotiate.

668
00:59:49,892 --> 00:59:51,602
You little fucker!

669
00:59:55,731 --> 00:59:56,815
Shit.

670
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:14,499
It is Spab!

671
01:00:16,334 --> 01:00:17,711
Is it Spab?

672
01:00:23,133 --> 01:00:26,052
Fucking Spab! Fucking A, man!

673
01:00:27,053 --> 01:00:29,097
I'll tell you something, Spab.

674
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:33,184
You sure as hell said some shit
that needed fucking said!

675
01:00:33,476 --> 01:00:35,687
- Thank you, Dolly.
- We heard that!

676
01:00:35,729 --> 01:00:37,063
Thank you, Earl.

677
01:00:37,147 --> 01:00:41,151
I'm just saying, and this is just me saying it,
but I just think...

678
01:00:41,276 --> 01:00:45,530
that you said a whole lot of shit
a lot of people in this country think about...

679
01:00:45,572 --> 01:00:48,741
but don't have the fucking guts
to say out loud.

680
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,954
I'm gonna go even further and say
they don't even have the fucking guts...

681
01:00:53,037 --> 01:00:54,664
to think about it.

682
01:00:55,581 --> 01:00:56,958
Heard that!

683
01:00:58,293 --> 01:00:59,794
Give me a hit.

684
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:22,441
- Thank you, honey.
- I want to ask you something, baby.

685
01:01:23,317 --> 01:01:25,903
Did you ever think
you were gonna bite it back there?

686
01:01:25,945 --> 01:01:28,989
- Let me put it this way, sweetheart.
- I heard that.

687
01:01:29,073 --> 01:01:33,077
What it boils down to is that I'm a survivor.
Okay? That's what it is.

688
01:01:33,452 --> 01:01:36,122
Anybody who thinks
I'm gonna live fast and die young...

689
01:01:36,163 --> 01:01:38,499
they don't know me now, do they?

690
01:01:44,797 --> 01:01:47,633
We interrupt this program
to bring you a special report.

691
01:01:47,716 --> 01:01:48,968
The Madison Heights Police...

692
01:01:49,051 --> 01:01:52,429
have issued an all points bulletin
for the arrest of Cliff Spab.

693
01:01:52,513 --> 01:01:57,142
Spab is wanted for assault and battery
on a local teenager at the Crestridge Mall.

694
01:01:57,226 --> 01:02:00,646
If you have any information
as to Cliff Spab's whereabouts...

695
01:02:00,687 --> 01:02:03,941
please contact the Madison Heights
Police Department immediately.

696
01:02:04,274 --> 01:02:05,776
Now back to our regular programs.

697
01:02:05,818 --> 01:02:07,319
Fucking liars!

698
01:02:09,404 --> 01:02:11,949
Don't sweat it, Spab. We got it covered.

699
01:02:12,616 --> 01:02:15,911
There ain't no fucking way
they're getting you without a fight, baby.

700
01:02:15,994 --> 01:02:18,455
Let's put the gun down, okay, buddy?

701
01:02:18,538 --> 01:02:21,625
Let's put it over there.
We don't need to go this far now.

702
01:02:21,667 --> 01:02:24,795
Spab, forget about it, all right?

703
01:02:25,087 --> 01:02:27,923
You showed us the way.
You opened the door.

704
01:02:28,924 --> 01:02:32,052
I say the motherfucking
Madison Heights pigs...

705
01:02:32,135 --> 01:02:35,639
shouldn't be allowed
to get away with this kind of shit, man.

706
01:02:38,058 --> 01:02:41,144
I say there's no way...

707
01:02:41,561 --> 01:02:45,357
that our Spab should be treated
with this kind of disrespect.

708
01:02:46,566 --> 01:02:50,654
Spab, you're a fucking hero.
You saved Wendy Pfister's life.

709
01:02:51,571 --> 01:02:55,575
I say fuck kinder-gentler,
that's what else I say.

710
01:02:56,284 --> 01:03:00,330
It's payback time in America

711
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:04,292
God shed his grace on thee

712
01:03:05,376 --> 01:03:09,339
And crown thy good with brotherhood

713
01:03:09,631 --> 01:03:13,092
from sea to shining sea

714
01:03:20,099 --> 01:03:23,811
How the hell is it my fault?
You were driving the whole damn time.

715
01:03:23,895 --> 01:03:27,565
Exactly, so why the fuck
should I be paying attention...

716
01:03:27,648 --> 01:03:32,361
to shit like that?
You're supposed to be the copilot, Earl.

717
01:03:34,447 --> 01:03:39,410
So watching the gas thing
is the copilot's responsibility now?

718
01:03:39,619 --> 01:03:41,495
- Yeah, you know it.
- Great.

719
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:58,262
Everyone wanted a piece of me.

720
01:03:58,304 --> 01:04:01,765
The only problem was,
there wasn't enough of me to go around.

721
01:04:01,807 --> 01:04:03,767
I guess Janet was right.

722
01:04:03,976 --> 01:04:07,396
I mean, this whole thing
was like a circle spinning out of control.

723
01:04:07,479 --> 01:04:10,441
First, you get sucked in,
then you get spun out.

724
01:04:10,524 --> 01:04:13,736
I was somewhere between getting sucked
and getting spun.

725
01:04:13,902 --> 01:04:16,238
Actually, the whole thing sucked.

726
01:04:16,405 --> 01:04:18,615
If Joe was alive,
he'd be laughing his ass off...

727
01:04:18,699 --> 01:04:21,243
and telling everyone to fuck off
at the same time.

728
01:04:21,368 --> 01:04:23,162
Joe was never subtle.

729
01:04:23,412 --> 01:04:25,956
Me, I had no idea what I was gonna do.

730
01:04:26,039 --> 01:04:29,793
What I knew for sure was that
road trips aren't all they're cracked up to be.

731
01:04:37,009 --> 01:04:39,303
- Hi there.
- How may I help you?

732
01:04:40,262 --> 01:04:42,764
Pamela, I'd like a room.

733
01:04:48,687 --> 01:04:51,648
The only thing available tonight is a suite.

734
01:04:51,773 --> 01:04:53,859
Fine, that'll be just fine.

735
01:04:54,526 --> 01:04:56,570
All right. And your name?

736
01:04:58,655 --> 01:04:59,906
Robert Plant.

737
01:05:02,951 --> 01:05:06,162
Hi there. Cliff Spab for Bayer Aspirin.

738
01:05:06,746 --> 01:05:09,749
Wendy Pfister,
which do you think Joe Dice will prefer. '

739
01:05:09,833 --> 01:05:12,877
microwave stuffing,
or your potatoes Iyonnaise?

740
01:05:13,044 --> 01:05:17,507
Joe would definitely prefer
the potatoes Iyonnaise. They're his favorite.

741
01:05:19,509 --> 01:05:22,095
Well then, Joe, which is it gonna be?

742
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:25,056
Wait, what are my choices again?

743
01:05:25,515 --> 01:05:28,977
- Wendy's stuffing...
- Or Wendy's potatoes Iyonnaise.

744
01:05:30,186 --> 01:05:32,855
I definitely prefer Wendy's...

745
01:05:34,983 --> 01:05:39,153
Joe Dice, a man so mean
he shot a guy for snoring too loud.

746
01:05:42,657 --> 01:05:46,202
Hi there! Do you know me?
I like shopping so much...

747
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:49,497
I've been in the same... store,
for Christ knows how long?

748
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:52,416
That's why I carry
the American Express card.

749
01:05:52,542 --> 01:05:55,753
If you go shopping in Madison Heights,
don't forget your Visa card...

750
01:05:55,836 --> 01:05:58,214
and don't forget your ammunition.

751
01:06:00,383 --> 01:06:03,344
I got one more thing to say. Remember this. '

752
01:06:06,597 --> 01:06:09,725
I'm not a hostage. I just play one on TV.

753
01:06:10,392 --> 01:06:13,521
Atta boy! That's Remington!

754
01:06:31,997 --> 01:06:34,416
- ... coming from.
- What kind of signal is it?

755
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:36,543
- Is it music?
- Don't know that yet.

756
01:06:36,627 --> 01:06:38,295
So damn what?

757
01:06:38,378 --> 01:06:41,799
Held hostage in a convenience store
for 36 days.

758
01:06:42,174 --> 01:06:43,967
So what's the point of talking?

759
01:06:44,051 --> 01:06:46,845
Yeah, you said it. So damn what?

760
01:06:46,929 --> 01:06:48,263
He was black.

761
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:49,514
So damn what?

762
01:06:49,598 --> 01:06:50,807
She was white.

763
01:06:50,891 --> 01:06:53,101
It has a totally cool sound to it, Cliff.

764
01:06:53,143 --> 01:06:55,896
They were as different as night and day.

765
01:06:56,229 --> 01:06:58,982
Everybody out there in TV land,
say it with me...

766
01:06:59,399 --> 01:07:01,276
So damn what?

767
01:07:01,943 --> 01:07:03,445
You say it, Wendy.

768
01:07:03,737 --> 01:07:05,155
So damn what?

769
01:07:05,238 --> 01:07:08,116
Gary Coleman and Dori Smelling star in...

770
01:07:08,366 --> 01:07:10,118
So Damn What.

771
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,662
The television event of the decade.

772
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:16,791
You're at Comedy Central.

773
01:07:28,178 --> 01:07:31,181
Okay, he's standing way up
in this building...

774
01:07:32,182 --> 01:07:35,602
and he shot himself right smack in the head.

775
01:07:39,314 --> 01:07:42,150
And he fell right into this parking lot...

776
01:07:43,193 --> 01:07:44,611
like, crunch!

777
01:07:49,407 --> 01:07:52,827
His final words,
I ain't never gonna forget them, goes. '

778
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:55,747
"So... what?"

779
01:07:57,248 --> 01:07:58,499
I mean...

780
01:07:58,916 --> 01:08:02,712
the thought of that
just sends chills right down to my spine.

781
01:08:03,463 --> 01:08:06,507
Okay, now,
this is still an unconfirmed report.

782
01:08:07,466 --> 01:08:10,052
Authorities in Madison Heights
have reason to believe...

783
01:08:10,136 --> 01:08:14,473
that the body recovered
earlier this evening, in a motel parking lot...

784
01:08:14,599 --> 01:08:16,809
is indeed that of Cliff Spab.

785
01:08:16,976 --> 01:08:19,854
An apparent suicide at the age of 20.

786
01:08:21,022 --> 01:08:22,440
We'll all miss you, Cliff.

787
01:08:37,705 --> 01:08:39,707
TVM. How may I direct your call?

788
01:08:39,874 --> 01:08:41,125
Hi there.

789
01:08:42,668 --> 01:08:46,088
Got a hot news scoop for you.
Let me talk to somebody.

790
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:48,007
One moment, please.

791
01:08:54,346 --> 01:08:56,723
TVM news desk, can I help you?

792
01:08:57,850 --> 01:09:00,561
Yeah. Cliff Spab ain't dead.

793
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:04,231
He's alive and well, and I can prove it.

794
01:09:04,314 --> 01:09:06,733
Are you talking about the Cliff Spab?

795
01:09:07,818 --> 01:09:09,027
Really?

796
01:09:09,403 --> 01:09:10,737
Yeah, that's right.

797
01:09:10,821 --> 01:09:13,073
Would he like to appear on TVM?

798
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:14,199
Yeah.

799
01:10:26,395 --> 01:10:28,231
Hi. Cliff Spab here.

800
01:10:28,481 --> 01:10:31,192
I'm not a VJ. I just play one on TVM.

801
01:10:34,612 --> 01:10:35,863
Hi there.

802
01:10:36,364 --> 01:10:38,824
I want to take you over to the couch.

803
01:10:38,908 --> 01:10:43,079
These are a couple of dear friends of mine.
Over here is Peggy, Grace...

804
01:10:43,162 --> 01:10:46,123
and Dottie over there.
Let's wave to the camera, girls.

805
01:10:47,124 --> 01:10:50,961
So when you get down to it,
you know, when they first asked me...

806
01:10:51,003 --> 01:10:53,714
to be a guest VJ here on TVM...

807
01:10:53,839 --> 01:10:55,841
they said I could talk about anything.

808
01:10:55,925 --> 01:10:59,595
As long as I didn't use words like...

809
01:10:59,678 --> 01:11:03,057
Especially not words like mother...
So I made a promise to them...

810
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:07,644
not to use words like...
And especially words like mother...

811
01:11:10,022 --> 01:11:12,941
So I decided to play
my 10 most favorite videos...

812
01:11:13,025 --> 01:11:16,987
where they either sing about
... show... or use... in the title.

813
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:22,659
"So... what?"
The clip you just saw is based...

814
01:11:22,701 --> 01:11:26,163
I do believe,
on the personal experiences of yours truly.

815
01:11:26,204 --> 01:11:28,832
But before we go to that next clip...

816
01:11:29,207 --> 01:11:31,293
See you in a minute, girls.

817
01:11:32,544 --> 01:11:36,173
I'd like to share something
kind of special with you all.

818
01:11:37,299 --> 01:11:42,095
I'd like to dedicate this to a close friend
who I haven't seen in way too long.

819
01:11:43,597 --> 01:11:45,807
Wendy, if you're out there...

820
01:11:47,476 --> 01:11:49,227
this Bull's for you.

821
01:12:14,377 --> 01:12:16,379
All right. Shut the fuck up!

822
01:12:21,259 --> 01:12:23,803
Time out, guys.

823
01:12:23,886 --> 01:12:28,016
Look, everybody keep quiet,
so you can hear what Spab has to say.

824
01:12:29,684 --> 01:12:32,812
Okay, Spab is ready for your questions.

825
01:12:36,274 --> 01:12:39,527
Mr. Spab, how do you explain
the behavior on those tapes?

826
01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:42,947
And why do you suppose that Split Image
made those tapes?

827
01:12:43,156 --> 01:12:47,201
I don't know. I never figured out
what the pantyhose guys wanted.

828
01:12:47,285 --> 01:12:50,913
I guess they were just bored shitless,
like the rest of us.

829
01:12:51,289 --> 01:12:53,416
Maybe they were trying to get through it.

830
01:12:53,499 --> 01:12:56,043
They didn't know
the fucking world was watching.

831
01:12:57,169 --> 01:12:58,713
Could you describe for us...

832
01:12:58,796 --> 01:13:02,299
the situation that led to your escape
from the Fun Stop?

833
01:13:02,883 --> 01:13:04,718
Yeah, we ran out of beer.

834
01:13:07,471 --> 01:13:09,098
Liked that one?

835
01:13:10,724 --> 01:13:13,352
Do you consider yourself an alcoholic?

836
01:13:13,769 --> 01:13:17,690
I don't have to consider myself nothing,
with all you reporters doing it for me.

837
01:13:19,191 --> 01:13:22,361
Exactly what is it
that you're rebelling against?

838
01:13:23,112 --> 01:13:25,197
That depends, what you got?

839
01:13:29,076 --> 01:13:32,871
I would like to know why you can't be
a little more serious in your answers?

840
01:13:32,955 --> 01:13:37,459
Look, this is the way I am, okay?
Don't be taking me so fucking seriously.

841
01:13:37,793 --> 01:13:40,629
Mr. Spab, what can you say about Joe Dice?

842
01:13:41,421 --> 01:13:44,633
There's nothing to say about Joe, is there?
He's gone.

843
01:13:46,134 --> 01:13:47,511
I miss him.

844
01:13:48,679 --> 01:13:51,390
Will he care that I'm wearing
a "Free Cliff Spab" shirt?

845
01:13:51,473 --> 01:13:54,476
He'll love it. You look great.
He'll be glad to see you.

846
01:13:56,812 --> 01:13:59,981
- How you doing, bro?
- Look at that big bottle of beer you got.

847
01:14:00,023 --> 01:14:03,401
I'm a big guy.
Kristen, this is Clifford. Clifford, Kristen.

848
01:14:04,611 --> 01:14:06,738
- Let's go.
- Nice to meet you.

849
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:12,577
How's everybody doing?

850
01:14:14,162 --> 01:14:16,289
I knew that dead guy wasn't you.
Didn't I say?

851
01:14:16,373 --> 01:14:17,457
It's too bad though.

852
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:21,169
Your school papers and shit
would've gone for twice the fucking cash.

853
01:14:21,211 --> 01:14:24,339
- Excuse me, you're Cliff Spab.
- Yeah, that's right.

854
01:14:24,381 --> 01:14:28,218
- He ain't Patty Hearst, buddy.
- He saved Wendy Pfister's life.

855
01:14:28,968 --> 01:14:33,223
- We saw it. That was something.
- Who do I have the pleasure of meeting?

856
01:14:33,932 --> 01:14:37,894
I'm Phll Connors and this is my wife, Rita.

857
01:14:38,061 --> 01:14:40,188
- Hi, Rita.
- Hi, how nice to meet you.

858
01:14:40,897 --> 01:14:43,483
What do you say
we take these guys hostage with us?

859
01:14:43,900 --> 01:14:47,070
Come on, Phll, Rita, come party with us!

860
01:14:47,862 --> 01:14:50,365
We're supposed to meet some people.

861
01:14:51,407 --> 01:14:52,700
What do you say, Rita?

862
01:14:57,872 --> 01:14:59,457
So fucking what!

863
01:15:02,168 --> 01:15:06,214
- Let's party! Come on, Phll!
- Party down!

864
01:15:06,756 --> 01:15:08,382
Yeah, here it is.

865
01:15:09,216 --> 01:15:10,426
This is class.

866
01:15:10,468 --> 01:15:13,054
- This is great. What'd I tell you?
- Yeah.

867
01:15:14,722 --> 01:15:15,639
Over here.

868
01:15:17,224 --> 01:15:19,101
Cliff, does this go in the bathtub?

869
01:15:19,185 --> 01:15:22,062
- The beer ball goes at the bar, right there.
- We got a bar?

870
01:15:22,104 --> 01:15:24,940
- Tell Spab about the concert.
- What concert is that?

871
01:15:24,982 --> 01:15:28,068
Want to see Spiral Jet, Friday?
They want you to introduce them.

872
01:15:28,110 --> 01:15:29,236
I do!

873
01:15:30,738 --> 01:15:31,822
Where are you?

874
01:15:31,906 --> 01:15:34,575
How about a beer?
You want a Bullseye or a Heineken?

875
01:15:34,617 --> 01:15:37,036
- Heineken.
- You look like a Heineken kind of girl.

876
01:15:37,119 --> 01:15:39,538
- I hope that's good.
- That is good.

877
01:15:39,997 --> 01:15:41,290
- You want a beer?
- No.

878
01:15:41,373 --> 01:15:42,416
Come on.

879
01:15:42,458 --> 01:15:45,127
Kris in there is your biggest fan.

880
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:47,588
But it's not like
I want to fuck you or anything.

881
01:15:47,629 --> 01:15:49,256
I think we should go.

882
01:15:49,298 --> 01:15:53,135
Sweetheart, let's just stay a little longer.
You got to live to learn, Phll.

883
01:15:53,218 --> 01:15:55,137
You got to live to learn. You said that.

884
01:15:55,179 --> 01:15:57,556
Being your brother
made me popular with the ladies.

885
01:15:57,639 --> 01:16:00,601
That's great, Scott.
I'm glad it's finally working for you.

886
01:16:00,934 --> 01:16:04,771
I just want to hang around, you know,
hear what you gotta say.

887
01:16:06,815 --> 01:16:08,692
I don't know shit.

888
01:16:11,737 --> 01:16:14,656
See, that is so Spab.

889
01:16:16,032 --> 01:16:18,994
- That is Spab.
- That is Spab, you're right.

890
01:16:23,081 --> 01:16:27,252
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Cliff Spab.

891
01:16:34,718 --> 01:16:36,052
Thank you!

892
01:21:34,264 --> 01:21:35,640
Hey, Wendy.

893
01:21:42,146 --> 01:21:43,439
Hi, Spab.

894
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:35,783
This is it.

895
01:22:37,534 --> 01:22:39,828
Where are you supposed
to go buy a beer now?

896
01:22:39,870 --> 01:22:43,707
I heard they want to tear this down
and turn this place into a memorial park.

897
01:22:47,211 --> 01:22:48,545
Goddamn it!

898
01:22:51,548 --> 01:22:54,468
Is that what it all boils down to?
A fucking memorial park?

899
01:22:55,385 --> 01:22:57,179
That's one way to live forever.

900
01:22:57,888 --> 01:23:01,350
I'd like to live forever,
but only for a little while.

901
01:23:05,562 --> 01:23:07,773
Spab, you are so full of shit.

902
01:23:08,857 --> 01:23:12,027
You know, you try to come off
as just some guy...

903
01:23:12,652 --> 01:23:14,237
but you're not just some guy.

904
01:23:16,072 --> 01:23:18,200
- You've got a message.
- Yeah?

905
01:23:19,534 --> 01:23:21,203
What's my message?

906
01:23:23,413 --> 01:23:26,249
Your message is that there is no message.

907
01:23:27,208 --> 01:23:29,169
Nothing really matters.

908
01:23:30,837 --> 01:23:33,256
The message is: "So Fucking What."

909
01:23:34,841 --> 01:23:37,260
You keep saying it,
but nobody really hears you.

910
01:23:42,098 --> 01:23:44,601
I'm sorry to break the bad news to you.

911
01:23:47,103 --> 01:23:48,730
I'm full of shit.

912
01:23:54,485 --> 01:23:57,989
There are plenty of things
that matter to me in this world.

913
01:23:58,072 --> 01:23:59,657
Yeah, like what?

914
01:24:04,287 --> 01:24:05,580
Like you.

915
01:24:17,967 --> 01:24:20,678
There's something I keep thinking about.

916
01:24:25,808 --> 01:24:30,312
Maybe even trying to explain
what happened in the store is just pointless.

917
01:24:33,482 --> 01:24:37,153
I mean, how do you explain
something like that to somebody?

918
01:24:38,279 --> 01:24:39,613
You can't.

919
01:24:43,867 --> 01:24:45,494
There is one way.

920
01:24:47,037 --> 01:24:49,873
You could lock them in a room for 36 days.

921
01:24:51,166 --> 01:24:53,252
They might understand then.

922
01:24:59,675 --> 01:25:01,552
You have to let them...

923
01:25:02,594 --> 01:25:04,471
watch some people die.

924
01:25:18,026 --> 01:25:19,277
Fuck it.

925
01:25:23,198 --> 01:25:25,033
Let's face it, Spab...

926
01:25:27,285 --> 01:25:29,704
we have this little understanding.

927
01:25:33,208 --> 01:25:35,836
Nobody else knows what it's all about.

928
01:25:39,047 --> 01:25:40,799
It's like a disease.

929
01:25:44,970 --> 01:25:46,972
Madison Heights Syndrome.

930
01:25:53,937 --> 01:25:55,730
If you don't have it...

931
01:25:57,732 --> 01:25:59,859
you can never understand it.

932
01:26:08,368 --> 01:26:12,038
Let's not even bother
trying to explain it to anybody else.

933
01:26:15,333 --> 01:26:19,921
- If you weren't in that store with us-
- You can shut the fuck up right now.

934
01:26:33,351 --> 01:26:36,896
Maybe Spab thought things would be
the same way they always were.

935
01:26:36,979 --> 01:26:39,106
I know I thought once I got out of there...

936
01:26:39,190 --> 01:26:42,777
I'd just be going back to Ozell Park High
on Monday morning.

937
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:46,989
Things have just been really weird
since getting out of that store.

938
01:26:47,448 --> 01:26:50,326
If you think about it enough,
you can go nuts.

939
01:26:50,409 --> 01:26:52,787
That's one of Spab's favorite lines,
by the way.

940
01:26:57,791 --> 01:27:02,004
Anyway, I guess I've talked enough,
so it's time to meet the guy...

941
01:27:02,087 --> 01:27:06,425
that made all this possible,
Mr. "So Fucking What" himself, Cliff Spab.

942
01:27:16,185 --> 01:27:17,519
Thank you.

943
01:27:17,978 --> 01:27:19,396
So fucking what!

944
01:27:30,991 --> 01:27:34,328
Standing out there on the stage
of Madison Heights High...

945
01:27:34,369 --> 01:27:38,415
I was suddenly knocked on my ass
with this strange sort of feeling.

946
01:27:38,498 --> 01:27:42,252
It wasn't just the cheering.
I wasn't really sure what it was.

947
01:27:42,335 --> 01:27:44,004
I just stood there looking stupid...

948
01:27:44,087 --> 01:27:47,507
for what seemed like a long time
trying to figure it all out.

949
01:27:47,549 --> 01:27:51,887
There was nothing I could do,
except wait for the chanting to die down.

950
01:27:52,637 --> 01:27:55,473
But the noise only grew louder and louder.

951
01:28:43,563 --> 01:28:45,273
Everything matters!

952
01:28:50,903 --> 01:28:54,198
Wendy Pfister and Cliff Spab
were shot this morning...

953
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:56,867
at a Madison Heights High School assembly.

954
01:28:56,909 --> 01:28:59,996
Witnesses say Spab
had just stepped up to the microphone...

955
01:29:00,079 --> 01:29:03,958
when three shots rang out.
Pfister was standing nearby.

956
01:29:04,417 --> 01:29:08,129
After witnessing the shooting,
hundreds of grief-stricken students...

957
01:29:08,212 --> 01:29:12,466
refused to return to class,
leaving the campus a virtual ghost town.

958
01:29:12,550 --> 01:29:15,219
Madison Heights High School senior,
Barbara B. Wyler...

959
01:29:15,427 --> 01:29:17,263
was arraigned in court today...

960
01:29:17,304 --> 01:29:20,641
in connection with the shooting
of Wendy Pfister and Cliff Spab...

961
01:29:21,725 --> 01:29:24,061
Why did you fire the first shot?

962
01:29:26,772 --> 01:29:29,108
Are you a friend of Cliff Spab?

963
01:29:33,362 --> 01:29:37,699
Babs Wyler was a perpetrator of violence
and a dangerous reactionary.

964
01:29:39,326 --> 01:29:41,829
The American people rest assured...

965
01:29:41,995 --> 01:29:44,122
that all the resources of this office...

966
01:29:44,206 --> 01:29:47,084
will be used to make sure that Babs Wyler...

967
01:29:47,125 --> 01:29:51,171
...the National Scholastic Merit
award for her essay, "Everything Matters".

968
01:29:51,797 --> 01:29:56,134
It's about a new generation of youngsters,
who take total responsibility...

969
01:29:56,176 --> 01:29:59,137
for everything they say, do and feel.

970
01:29:59,846 --> 01:30:01,932
This is about the First Amendment.

971
01:30:02,015 --> 01:30:05,185
What Babs did
was an act of symbolic free speech.

972
01:30:05,268 --> 01:30:09,731
The issue here is whether you should
punish a brilliant, gifted young woman...

973
01:30:09,815 --> 01:30:13,902
for bringing the message of responsibility,
hope and optimism to the world.

974
01:30:14,486 --> 01:30:15,779
I don't think so.

975
01:30:15,946 --> 01:30:20,825
...where dozens of protesters are staging
an all-night vigil...

976
01:30:21,284 --> 01:30:25,622
...we have watched with fascination, a
straight-A student, Barbara "Babs" 'Wyler...

977
01:30:25,747 --> 01:30:27,999
an anything-but-ordinary young American...

978
01:30:28,083 --> 01:30:30,835
has been catapulted
from suburban obscurity...

979
01:30:30,877 --> 01:30:32,378
to international fame.

980
01:30:32,462 --> 01:30:35,965
Tonight, in a live interview
from Madison Heights County Jail...

981
01:30:36,007 --> 01:30:39,636
we will learn all about Babs' philosophy
for a new age. '

982
01:30:39,761 --> 01:30:42,430
a philosophy in which everything matters.

983
01:30:42,513 --> 01:30:45,141
Those are the words
of Barbara "Babs" Wyler...

984
01:30:45,183 --> 01:30:48,478
the courageous young woman
we have come to care about so deeply.

985
01:30:48,519 --> 01:30:50,897
Babs has been through more
in the past few weeks...

986
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:53,358
than most of us will experience in a lifetime.

987
01:30:53,399 --> 01:30:55,526
But she has retained her dignity...

988
01:30:55,610 --> 01:30:58,362
refusing to be reduced
to the level of her detractors.

989
01:30:58,446 --> 01:31:02,658
When she emerged from her terrible ordeal,
she found herself strengthened...

990
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:05,036
and her "Everything Matters"
philosophy intact.

991
01:31:05,077 --> 01:31:07,914
In short, Babs Wyler has been transformed...

992
01:31:07,997 --> 01:31:12,376
from a typical American teenager
into an atypical American phenomenon.

993
01:31:12,752 --> 01:31:16,505
Tonight, for the first time,
we'll get to spend an hour with Babs...

994
01:31:16,547 --> 01:31:18,841
in the privacy of her own home.

995
01:31:19,675 --> 01:31:22,053
Babs, what are your impressions
of Cliff Spab?

996
01:31:24,555 --> 01:31:27,975
I must be very careful
of what I say about Cliff Spab.

997
01:31:28,392 --> 01:31:30,978
- But why?
- Because-

998
01:31:39,194 --> 01:31:40,863
- Hey, Wendy.
- Spab.

999
01:31:46,201 --> 01:31:49,288
- How about another beer?
- How about a bag of gumnuts?

1000
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:51,165
How about a stale burrito?

1001
01:31:51,248 --> 01:31:54,501
How about some 3-in-1 Oil
for your folding chair?

1002
01:31:54,793 --> 01:31:57,004
How about a bath in the sink?

1003
01:31:57,504 --> 01:31:59,173
How about a song?

1004
01:32:06,513 --> 01:32:08,473
Are we getting married or what?

1005
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:12,311
Hey, guy, you fucking know it.
