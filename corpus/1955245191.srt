<b>THE DOOMS CHAPEL HORROR</b>

2
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:41,416
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

3
00:02:30,582 --> 00:02:32,350
It's going to
be hotter tomorrow.

4
00:02:32,383 --> 00:02:35,787
Which is why we shouldn't
be jackassing around.

5
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,289
Can you give me
a hand down here?

6
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,224
It does this
every single year.

7
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:40,960
I don't understand
why dad just doesn't

8
00:02:40,992 --> 00:02:42,328
get out and get a new one.

9
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,596
It's an expensive rig, Kyle.

10
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:46,264
With what little we have from
agriculture, it makes no sense.

11
00:02:46,298 --> 00:02:47,533
I'm going
to go get a soda.

12
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:49,769
There's water in the jug.

13
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:51,203
I don't want water.

14
00:02:51,236 --> 00:02:52,871
You know what
daddy's going to say.

15
00:02:56,307 --> 00:03:00,947
Son, get back out there
and help your brother...

16
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:05,250
and put that damn camera down
before it's gone for good.

17
00:03:05,283 --> 00:03:07,453
I's just getting us sodas.

18
00:03:07,485 --> 00:03:09,322
Water's in the jug.
You know that.

19
00:03:09,354 --> 00:03:10,355
I don't want...

20
00:03:13,525 --> 00:03:15,328
Ryan.

21
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,829
Emmett?

22
00:03:17,862 --> 00:03:19,399
Ryan!

23
00:03:32,677 --> 00:03:34,680
No.

24
00:03:36,314 --> 00:03:37,716
No!

25
00:03:39,951 --> 00:03:41,353
No.

26
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:51,698
I haven't watched
that in a long time.

27
00:03:54,532 --> 00:03:55,601
How long, Kyle?

28
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:07,313
I think it's been about...
11 years... since Ryan died.

29
00:04:07,346 --> 00:04:11,850
I think everybody probably had
somebody like Ryan in their lives.

30
00:04:11,883 --> 00:04:16,688
He's perfect, you know, all-American
high school quarterback.

31
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:20,359
He wasn't just Katie
and Emmett's son.

32
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,497
He was Kaler Mills' son.

33
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:27,866
And they all thought
I killed him.

34
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:31,370
A copy of the tape
showed up in my locker.

35
00:04:31,403 --> 00:04:33,439
That's when I
started watching it.

36
00:04:33,471 --> 00:04:38,343
I got to be obsessed with
the video after a while.

37
00:04:38,377 --> 00:04:44,016
I watched it over and over...
for a long time.

38
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,456
He was just...

39
00:04:51,122 --> 00:04:54,526
How at that moment
that he died...

40
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,463
the way mom and dad
looked at me...

41
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:04,437
you know, knowing it was...
it was my fault.

42
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,672
And the accidental release of
the tape didn't help that.

43
00:05:06,704 --> 00:05:08,139
How did that happen?

44
00:05:08,173 --> 00:05:14,413
Some fine, upstanding employee of the
Kaler Mills Sheriff's Department

45
00:05:14,446 --> 00:05:16,482
saw fit to take it home.

46
00:05:20,485 --> 00:05:22,487
After that, it got out.

47
00:05:24,021 --> 00:05:26,425
Everybody saw me bitching
about having to help Ryan.

48
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:29,495
And because I was
jackassing around...

49
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,604
they all watched him die.

50
00:05:39,471 --> 00:05:41,406
It's on
the internet today.

51
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,511
It's... I mean, it's the reason why
we're together for this project.

52
00:05:45,543 --> 00:05:51,916
You know, you'd be surprised
how many people know who I am

53
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:56,389
even though my face isn't
even on camera, just Ryan's.

54
00:05:58,023 --> 00:05:59,692
What can you
tell me about yourself?

55
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:08,666
Why do you think
this stuff isn't my thing?

56
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:10,603
Kyle, you think too much.

57
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:13,506
Does it even matter?

58
00:06:13,538 --> 00:06:15,540
Sure it does.

59
00:06:15,574 --> 00:06:17,475
How? Why does who you
aren't matter to you.

60
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:19,478
Well, look at you.

61
00:06:19,511 --> 00:06:21,814
You go to dances, and you
go out every Friday night.

62
00:06:21,846 --> 00:06:26,651
And whenever we go to dinner,
everybody knows you there.

63
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:31,624
And, like, whenever dad needs
help, he always goes to you.

64
00:06:31,656 --> 00:06:34,760
That's because you always got
that camera glued to your face.

65
00:06:36,528 --> 00:06:38,063
What else can I do?

66
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:40,533
I don't know.
Maybe help out.

67
00:06:40,565 --> 00:06:41,733
Come on, little brother.

68
00:06:43,935 --> 00:06:46,471
I like it.

69
00:06:46,504 --> 00:06:48,173
And that's what matters.

70
00:06:48,206 --> 00:06:50,509
I am who I am.

71
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,143
You are who you are.

72
00:06:52,177 --> 00:06:54,480
Mom and dad are who they are.

73
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,149
There's no reason you
all got to be same.

74
00:07:19,504 --> 00:07:21,906
Take some time, buddy.

75
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:24,209
You sure you're all right
to do this?

76
00:07:24,242 --> 00:07:26,445
Yeah, I mean...

77
00:07:27,913 --> 00:07:32,585
I agreed to it. I mean, it's
all... it's all fair game.

78
00:07:32,617 --> 00:07:33,685
All right.

79
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,838
Hey.

80
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,039
Hi.

81
00:07:57,608 --> 00:07:59,478
It's time to get up.

82
00:08:00,778 --> 00:08:02,514
OK.

83
00:08:36,248 --> 00:08:37,850
He's still sound asleep.

84
00:08:37,883 --> 00:08:39,685
So much for first thing.

85
00:08:39,717 --> 00:08:41,653
Yeah. I think he was
up most of the night

86
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,690
making his lists and
packing and stuff.

87
00:08:44,722 --> 00:08:47,659
Yeah.
What a professional.

88
00:08:47,692 --> 00:08:50,328
You should scan
these and then frame them.

89
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:52,331
That's what people do.

90
00:08:52,364 --> 00:08:53,331
Is that right?

91
00:08:54,732 --> 00:08:57,201
I don't even
know which one's me.

92
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,240
You look like your mom.

93
00:09:01,273 --> 00:09:03,207
Yeah.

94
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,780
Ryan got the, rugged good
looks of big ol' Emmett Cole.

95
00:09:08,813 --> 00:09:10,682
Damn.
You're right.

96
00:09:19,758 --> 00:09:21,561
That was that same summer.

97
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:28,267
We don't have to look anymore.
OK?

98
00:09:30,201 --> 00:09:32,770
Any of this bother you?

99
00:09:32,803 --> 00:09:34,740
What?

100
00:09:34,773 --> 00:09:37,909
My baggage.

101
00:09:41,178 --> 00:09:44,716
I mean, we both
have baggage, Kyle.

102
00:09:48,186 --> 00:09:51,156
I like the fact that
you've experienced life.

103
00:09:51,188 --> 00:09:54,360
I think it's something
we both have in common.

104
00:09:55,693 --> 00:10:01,065
You know that I... I
will never get the chance

105
00:10:01,099 --> 00:10:04,003
like this to, go home again.

106
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:06,905
You shouldn't be
comparing scars, babe.

107
00:10:07,938 --> 00:10:11,209
I know, and I'm not.

108
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:19,018
I just... I mean, look at you.

109
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,653
You're graduating
from film school.

110
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,688
You didn't end up in a frat.

111
00:10:25,356 --> 00:10:30,728
You might go to LA,
and... and you have me.

112
00:10:30,761 --> 00:10:31,896
Yeah, I do.

113
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:33,164
Yeah.

114
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:18,837
Henry.

115
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,340
I'll be damned.

116
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:24,308
Kyle Cole.

117
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:26,377
You ain't change one bit.

118
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,912
You have.

119
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:29,848
Look like you put
on about 50 pounds.

120
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,315
Lifting all them beers man.

121
00:12:31,349 --> 00:12:33,485
It's good to see you.

122
00:12:33,518 --> 00:12:35,788
-Who's this?
-This is Mandy.

123
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:36,989
Hi, Mandy.
I'm Henry.

124
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:39,992
-Nice to meet you.
-That's Tanner.

125
00:12:40,024 --> 00:12:41,860
What's up?

126
00:12:41,893 --> 00:12:44,363
You were a friend of
Kyle's before the accident?

127
00:12:47,532 --> 00:12:51,836
Yeah, I guess you
could say that.

128
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,908
More like his only friend, but...
besides Ryan and his friends too

129
00:12:55,941 --> 00:13:00,812
I mean, but... we pretty
much buddied up, just us.

130
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,114
And after the accident?

131
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:10,322
Well, after...
it's a little harder,

132
00:13:10,355 --> 00:13:12,324
you know, to be his friend.

133
00:13:12,356 --> 00:13:14,860
And his folks kind
of held Kyle up

134
00:13:14,893 --> 00:13:17,830
as accountable
for what happened.

135
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:22,367
I think he did too,
you know, fault his self.

136
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,336
And that was then.

137
00:13:24,369 --> 00:13:28,607
And if it happened again...
thank the Lord it won't...

138
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,442
I'd say fuck all the rest.

139
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:34,980
Well, as an administrator,

140
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:39,518
we see a few more kids
like Kyle each year.

141
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:45,157
You, worry about what sort
of person they'll end up being.

142
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:49,895
It seems like one little
push could send them off

143
00:13:49,927 --> 00:13:51,864
in the wrong direction.

144
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:55,500
But even with the tragedy
and everything that followed,

145
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:58,537
I believe that our prayers
found their way back

146
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,272
to this young man.

147
00:14:00,304 --> 00:14:03,207
I remember Kyle Cole.

148
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,645
After the accident,
Katie and Emmett

149
00:14:07,678 --> 00:14:09,881
thought it be best if
Kyle were very active here

150
00:14:09,914 --> 00:14:11,582
at the church of course.

151
00:14:11,615 --> 00:14:13,284
And me being his
Sunday school teacher,

152
00:14:13,317 --> 00:14:19,191
it just made sense for me to
lead his way through this.

153
00:14:19,224 --> 00:14:22,227
What did Kyle
think about this plan.

154
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:27,164
Well, I...

155
00:14:27,197 --> 00:14:29,567
Kyle, was, not the kind
of person you'd expect

156
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,035
to do something like this.

157
00:14:31,068 --> 00:14:32,904
I mean, he was one of
the younger students,

158
00:14:32,937 --> 00:14:34,206
one of the quieter boys.

159
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:38,076
But we all knew kids
like them, you know.

160
00:14:38,109 --> 00:14:39,912
He was volunteering for
the fall harvest picnic.

161
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:44,081
It's just a wonderful buffet we
do every year for our church,

162
00:14:44,115 --> 00:14:49,520
but I caught him peeing in the
giant jack-o-lantern Jell-O mold.

163
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:54,026
The Jell-O mix
was already in there,

164
00:14:54,058 --> 00:14:56,327
and it was just hours
from setting up and I...

165
00:14:58,096 --> 00:14:59,464
That's not funny.

166
00:14:59,496 --> 00:15:00,998
That would have
been on the buffet table

167
00:15:01,032 --> 00:15:02,501
for the entire
church family the next day.

168
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:03,668
I...

169
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:05,937
OK. OK.
I'm sorry.

170
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:08,673
I'm just expecting something...

171
00:15:08,706 --> 00:15:10,241
Something worse?

172
00:15:10,274 --> 00:15:13,211
Well, there was.

173
00:15:13,244 --> 00:15:17,081
When I caught him,
he didn't, put it away.

174
00:15:20,351 --> 00:15:23,654
He just stood there, and he
pointed at that Jell-O mold,

175
00:15:23,687 --> 00:15:28,527
and he said,
"This is what I think

176
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:34,933
of your... f-ing self-righteous attempt
to make me forget all that's happened."

177
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:44,042
And then "How about you
be a good little... cunt

178
00:15:44,075 --> 00:15:46,578
and go and tell them
all what I've done."

179
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:51,984
He waved me away.

180
00:15:54,052 --> 00:15:57,122
I've never had anyone expose
themselves to me like that...

181
00:15:57,154 --> 00:16:01,393
speak to me like that
for that matter... ever.

182
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:06,230
All right.

183
00:16:06,264 --> 00:16:07,466
OK.

184
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:11,637
All right. We're done.

185
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,192
When you live
in a town like Kaler Mills

186
00:16:34,225 --> 00:16:37,162
and you're lucky enough to
have a boy like Ryan growing up

187
00:16:37,195 --> 00:16:41,800
around you, everybody
has hopes for him.

188
00:16:41,832 --> 00:16:43,534
When he stayed to
work the family farm,

189
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:47,204
nobody... and I mean
nobody... complained.

190
00:16:47,238 --> 00:16:50,208
Glad to have a man
like that around.

191
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,110
Real leader he was becoming.

192
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,149
Hell, I trusted
that 18-year-old boy

193
00:16:58,182 --> 00:17:01,086
more than that sorry-ass deputy
I got stuck with.

194
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:07,558
Now, you knew
Ryan's brother Kyle as well.

195
00:17:07,592 --> 00:17:09,795
Your son Henry was
good friends with him.

196
00:17:09,827 --> 00:17:12,663
That's right.

197
00:17:12,696 --> 00:17:17,435
You know, a boy that age, you
know who they'll be as a man.

198
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:21,373
Now, I can't say, as a lad, I
would have done Kyle any better

199
00:17:21,405 --> 00:17:23,207
than his friends done him.

200
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,278
Henry was standing.

201
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,313
But I think when he left
to stay with Katie's sister

202
00:17:29,346 --> 00:17:32,783
in the city to clean the
salt out of the wounds,

203
00:17:32,817 --> 00:17:35,153
I think we all started to heal.

204
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:52,403
So this is it?

205
00:17:52,436 --> 00:17:53,571
This is it.

206
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,339
Do you want
to talk to them?

207
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:56,540
They're not home.

208
00:17:56,574 --> 00:17:59,577
It's a perfect
opportunity to get a few shots.

209
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:02,147
We don't have to.

210
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,449
Just a few shots.

211
00:18:04,481 --> 00:18:06,451
It's up to you, babe.

212
00:19:54,892 --> 00:19:57,362
Hang on.
I got to call you back.

213
00:19:57,394 --> 00:20:00,397
Kyle Cole!

214
00:20:00,431 --> 00:20:01,600
Welcome back.

215
00:20:11,742 --> 00:20:15,379
Last I laid eyes
on you, Kyle Cole,

216
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:18,450
you was just a sorry
excuse for a little boy.

217
00:20:18,482 --> 00:20:20,551
And there sure
ain't much changed.

218
00:20:22,452 --> 00:20:23,788
Samuel.

219
00:20:25,556 --> 00:20:28,559
I've got to tell you, Kyle...

220
00:20:29,727 --> 00:20:32,797
Jordan hasn't forgotten...

221
00:20:32,829 --> 00:20:39,270
about his, yours,
ours arrangement.

222
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:42,874
When kind of people
take a man's request lightly

223
00:20:42,906 --> 00:20:46,410
and not see them through,
but you know that.

224
00:20:46,443 --> 00:20:47,912
What you filming about?

225
00:20:47,944 --> 00:20:49,580
We're shooting
a documentary.

226
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:55,019
I like that you
brought friends, Kyle.

227
00:20:57,555 --> 00:21:00,392
I mean to say girlfriends.

228
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,828
Come on.
I'm just fucking with you.

229
00:21:04,862 --> 00:21:08,500
Besides you'd look a whole lot
less like a piece of snatch

230
00:21:08,532 --> 00:21:11,769
if it wasn't for that woman's
coat and them fucking boots.

231
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,772
Hey.

232
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:15,373
That was a long time ago.

233
00:21:15,405 --> 00:21:16,974
OK?

234
00:21:18,476 --> 00:21:21,980
Ain't no worries, but it doesn't
mean anything anymore, OK?

235
00:21:22,012 --> 00:21:24,915
Just forget about it.

236
00:21:24,949 --> 00:21:28,753
You and I both know that
you ain't doing this

237
00:21:28,786 --> 00:21:31,956
out of the goodness
of your heart.

238
00:21:31,989 --> 00:21:35,559
There ain't a drop of
goodness in you, Kyle Cole.

239
00:21:37,394 --> 00:21:41,365
You wasn't thinking that it'd
be so simple making peace

240
00:21:41,398 --> 00:21:43,367
after all these years?
Would you?

241
00:21:43,401 --> 00:21:45,470
Guys, let's go.

242
00:21:45,502 --> 00:21:46,704
Kyle!
My god.

243
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:47,939
Back the fuck up, bitch!

244
00:21:47,971 --> 00:21:49,641
Back up, Mandy.

245
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:54,479
Hey, princess.

246
00:21:54,511 --> 00:22:00,518
You and I both know what comes
from that there fucking heart.

247
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:04,755
I knows it, and most of
all, Jordan knows it too.

248
00:22:04,788 --> 00:22:09,560
And it is plainly clear to me
that you are here to collect.

249
00:22:11,395 --> 00:22:14,499
Jordan is going to be mighty
interested in my discoveries,

250
00:22:14,531 --> 00:22:15,899
Kyle Cole.

251
00:22:15,932 --> 00:22:17,167
Mighty interested.

252
00:22:17,201 --> 00:22:22,606
In fact, well, I'd say he's been
waiting for this time to come.

253
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,775
We'll be gone in a few days.

254
00:22:23,807 --> 00:22:25,676
Like I said!

255
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:31,817
Consider it done, my friend.

256
00:22:37,587 --> 00:22:39,758
I'll be seeing you around,
Kyle Cole.

257
00:22:47,731 --> 00:22:49,067
Hey.

258
00:22:51,067 --> 00:22:52,703
Who the hell was that?

259
00:22:54,872 --> 00:22:56,541
Long story.

260
00:23:23,233 --> 00:23:25,537
Hey. Who are those guys at
the bar staring at us?

261
00:23:25,569 --> 00:23:28,439
That's Ryan's friends.

262
00:23:28,472 --> 00:23:31,509
Well, cheers to Kyle Cole
being back in Kaler Mills.

263
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:32,776
All right.

264
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:34,413
Welcome back, buddy.

265
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,555
Hey, Kyle,

266
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:46,557
So who was that
lunatic in the truck?

267
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,192
What lunatic?

268
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:53,564
He's from out on Dooms Chapel.

269
00:23:53,597 --> 00:23:55,866
The hell they want?

270
00:24:00,136 --> 00:24:04,576
It was just... just
somebody I used to know.

271
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,609
It was Samuel.

272
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:09,646
I knew the guy a little
bit after I withdrew,

273
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,548
I guess you might say.

274
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,949
Yeah, I'd say it.

275
00:24:11,982 --> 00:24:13,484
Samuel?

276
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:14,853
Crazy bastard.

277
00:24:14,885 --> 00:24:18,490
I just saw him around
a little more often.

278
00:24:18,522 --> 00:24:19,690
I mean, it was just one guy.

279
00:24:19,723 --> 00:24:22,626
He's in a commune.
Isn't he?

280
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,629
Yeah.
They are a commune.

281
00:24:24,662 --> 00:24:26,564
They live out past
Dooms Chapel Road.

282
00:24:26,596 --> 00:24:29,666
Most of them don't stray
too far from the property.

283
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,836
I just saw him around
a little more often.

284
00:24:31,868 --> 00:24:33,003
That was it.

285
00:24:33,037 --> 00:24:35,539
That's it?

286
00:24:35,573 --> 00:24:36,541
That's it.

287
00:24:39,576 --> 00:24:40,644
Samuel.

288
00:24:40,678 --> 00:24:43,515
He ain't half as
scary as Jordan.

289
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:45,817
My dad wrangles a few of them
up every time we have a problem.

290
00:24:45,849 --> 00:24:48,086
It's more or less to make
sure they know their place.

291
00:24:48,118 --> 00:24:49,086
Who's Jordan?

292
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:52,089
Jordan is their,
cult leader.

293
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:54,826
Mostly the stories people
tell about Jordan that

294
00:24:54,858 --> 00:24:57,561
gets everybody so freaked out.

295
00:24:57,595 --> 00:24:58,730
Stories.

296
00:24:58,762 --> 00:25:00,130
Tell.

297
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:04,635
Remember Bobby Day?
Big kid.

298
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,604
Beast of a kid.

299
00:25:05,636 --> 00:25:08,705
Well, he claims Jordan
can raise the dead.

300
00:25:08,739 --> 00:25:12,210
Well, tell it.
You know better than me.

301
00:25:12,242 --> 00:25:14,077
Bobby had a story
about a barn raising

302
00:25:14,111 --> 00:25:15,547
he and his daddy
was helping with.

303
00:25:15,579 --> 00:25:17,682
Bobby claims he's on
the truck watching them

304
00:25:17,714 --> 00:25:19,317
boys have a tough time at it.

305
00:25:19,349 --> 00:25:21,852
Barn goes over right on top
of Buddy Defew's cousin.

306
00:25:21,885 --> 00:25:24,087
Yeah.
I remember that.

307
00:25:24,121 --> 00:25:25,790
These Dooms Chapel
folks walk up,

308
00:25:25,823 --> 00:25:28,527
and Jordan clears everyone away.

309
00:25:29,693 --> 00:25:31,729
Folks tend to do that
around him anyhow.

310
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:34,331
While he's all running around
screaming, Jimmy's dead!

311
00:25:34,365 --> 00:25:36,034
Jimmy's dead!

312
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:39,037
Jordan bends down real
close, listening to him

313
00:25:39,069 --> 00:25:41,605
like Jimmy saying something.

314
00:25:41,638 --> 00:25:44,708
And then Jordan whispers
back into Jimmy's ear.

315
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:49,747
And then snap!

316
00:25:51,848 --> 00:25:55,953
Jordan grabs Jimmy so hard,
and Jimmy gasps, gets up,

317
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:57,755
starts walking around.

318
00:25:57,788 --> 00:25:59,691
Dead, then not dead.

319
00:25:59,723 --> 00:26:02,059
Bullshit.
I don't buy that.

320
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:03,695
Believe it.

321
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,697
That guy still
telling that story today?

322
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,765
He can't.
Dead.

323
00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:16,907
You know, usually when
you flush a piece of shit,

324
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:19,611
it stays gone.

325
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:20,478
Where you going?

326
00:26:20,511 --> 00:26:22,346
Pisser.
You want to hold it for me?

327
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,948
Be like y'all are back
in the fourth grade.

328
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,682
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

329
00:26:25,715 --> 00:26:27,251
I got.

330
00:26:28,685 --> 00:26:32,689
I'll tell you what Kyle,
why don't we, see you

331
00:26:32,722 --> 00:26:34,091
and your friends out of the bar.

332
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:37,628
Why don't you guys
just back the fuck up?

333
00:26:42,032 --> 00:26:44,701
Get the fuck out. Get that
fucking camera out of here.

334
00:26:44,734 --> 00:26:46,336
OK. This is dumb.
We'll just leave.

335
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:48,071
Not you, sugar tits!

336
00:26:48,105 --> 00:26:50,741
Hey! Hey! We're grown
fucking adults. All right?

337
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:51,843
We're leaving.

338
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:53,711
-Excuse me.
-Come on, Tanner.

339
00:27:06,457 --> 00:27:07,825
Kyle!

340
00:27:07,857 --> 00:27:09,326
Stay down, boy!

341
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:10,661
Kyle, are you OK?

342
00:27:10,694 --> 00:27:11,729
Come here.
Get back over...

343
00:27:11,761 --> 00:27:12,829
Yeah.
Come on, Kyle.

344
00:27:12,863 --> 00:27:14,365
We're walking your ass home.

345
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,043
Get back here, son of a bitch!

346
00:27:39,089 --> 00:27:40,692
Kyle!

347
00:27:40,724 --> 00:27:42,359
Let him go!
Come on.

348
00:27:46,763 --> 00:27:48,966
Come on, RJ.

349
00:27:49,767 --> 00:27:50,802
Go!

350
00:27:53,903 --> 00:27:55,039
Come on.
Come on.

351
00:28:04,781 --> 00:28:06,750
Now where the
fuck did y'all go?

352
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:10,088
Hiding like a bunch of little
bitches, what you doing.

353
00:28:11,321 --> 00:28:13,457
Goddamn, why don't you
come on out of hiding?

354
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:16,794
Quit being a bunch of pussies!

355
00:28:16,826 --> 00:28:18,429
Where them son of bitches at?

356
00:28:18,461 --> 00:28:20,865
You know what that
means, don't you?

357
00:28:20,897 --> 00:28:21,832
Henry!

358
00:28:21,865 --> 00:28:24,335
You and your bitch
better come out, Henry!

359
00:28:24,367 --> 00:28:27,171
Cheezberger is pissed,
and you remember

360
00:28:27,203 --> 00:28:28,839
what he did to those
two nigs down in Salem.

361
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,813
What the fuck was that shit?
That came from the quarry.

362
00:28:35,846 --> 00:28:37,115
Let's go!
It's them!

363
00:28:37,147 --> 00:28:37,915
-Come on. Let's go.
-Get in the truck!

364
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:40,719
-Get on out of here.
-Come on!

365
00:28:45,355 --> 00:28:46,924
Let's get back to the shop.

366
00:28:50,493 --> 00:28:52,797
OK.

367
00:28:52,829 --> 00:28:54,198
Let's go.

368
00:29:07,811 --> 00:29:09,279
Dude, what
the fuck was that?

369
00:29:09,313 --> 00:29:10,815
You got me.

370
00:29:15,986 --> 00:29:17,822
Seriously.
What was that?

371
00:29:17,855 --> 00:29:18,890
You think they're coming back...

372
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,458
Them drunks?

373
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,160
Ain't coming back up
in here unless they

374
00:29:22,192 --> 00:29:24,796
want Betty and some rock salt
to teach them a thing or two.

375
00:29:26,864 --> 00:29:28,332
Tell you what, man.

376
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:30,934
Sure ain't
changed much.

377
00:29:32,569 --> 00:29:34,304
No, it hasn't.

378
00:29:35,873 --> 00:29:38,308
I think we finally lost
them around the junkyard

379
00:29:38,342 --> 00:29:39,410
right up here.

380
00:29:39,442 --> 00:29:41,578
You could have
killed that guy last night.

381
00:29:41,612 --> 00:29:43,815
No, I couldn't.

382
00:29:43,847 --> 00:29:46,884
That's... it's... he's
done that before.

383
00:29:46,916 --> 00:29:48,185
Remember that?
Yeah.

384
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:49,554
It seems like every time
I hang out with you,

385
00:29:49,586 --> 00:29:51,122
I got to hit somebody
with a bottle.

386
00:29:51,154 --> 00:29:53,124
I thought Randy was
going to kick my ass too.

387
00:29:53,156 --> 00:29:54,457
Yeah.
I didn't even do it.

388
00:29:58,494 --> 00:30:00,463
That's one of dad's deputies.

389
00:30:00,497 --> 00:30:03,468
Let's, see what's going on.

390
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,903
Hey, what's up?

391
00:30:05,935 --> 00:30:06,936
Henry?

392
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,906
Boy, you need to get on
down up by your daddy.

393
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,875
Go on.

394
00:30:10,907 --> 00:30:12,176
Thanks.

395
00:30:13,943 --> 00:30:16,279
I have a bad
feeling about this.

396
00:30:16,313 --> 00:30:18,549
This... this is where
we heard that thing out here

397
00:30:18,582 --> 00:30:20,017
last night.

398
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:21,451
You were here?

399
00:30:22,586 --> 00:30:24,322
Yeah. We ain't going
to talk about all that

400
00:30:24,355 --> 00:30:27,057
when we get up to Daddy, OK?

401
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:28,925
You better tell me that
you drove that thing

402
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:31,128
home last night, and you ain't
already been here this morning.

403
00:30:31,161 --> 00:30:32,529
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

404
00:30:32,563 --> 00:30:34,899
What's going on?

405
00:30:34,932 --> 00:30:38,937
We found that Curtis boy
and Cheezberger.

406
00:30:41,471 --> 00:30:44,908
What were you boys
into last night.

407
00:30:44,942 --> 00:30:47,510
We... we were out.

408
00:30:47,544 --> 00:30:49,146
We got in a fight, dad.

409
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:50,080
What?

410
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,884
It was with Curtis,
Cheezberger, and RJ.

411
00:30:52,916 --> 00:30:56,653
But we ran off and lost them
before anything got serious.

412
00:30:56,686 --> 00:30:57,988
Jesus, Henry.

413
00:30:58,021 --> 00:30:59,589
I know, dad.
But we lost them.

414
00:30:59,623 --> 00:31:02,026
I mean, we've got
nothing to do with this.

415
00:31:02,058 --> 00:31:03,994
We heard something last night.

416
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,631
Something big.
I don't know what.

417
00:31:06,663 --> 00:31:08,598
You
say you heard something.

418
00:31:08,632 --> 00:31:10,468
Yeah.
I... something howled.

419
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,105
I don't know what it... I
don't know what it was.

420
00:31:14,137 --> 00:31:16,606
You looking for RJ?

421
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,976
Well, now we are.

422
00:31:19,009 --> 00:31:20,243
Didn't have any
reason to think we

423
00:31:20,277 --> 00:31:22,947
had a third victim
until you pulled up.

424
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,315
We'd like to help search.

425
00:31:24,347 --> 00:31:27,384
-No.
-Yeah.

426
00:31:27,417 --> 00:31:29,052
Yeah.
We should help too.

427
00:31:29,086 --> 00:31:30,320
All right.
You can help.

428
00:31:30,354 --> 00:31:34,392
But if you find something, you
call out and stay clear of it.

429
00:31:34,424 --> 00:31:36,560
Whitess.
Sheriff.

430
00:31:39,128 --> 00:31:40,263
Take these kids out there.

431
00:31:40,297 --> 00:31:42,666
They want help look for RJ.

432
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,035
Yes, sir.

433
00:31:44,067 --> 00:31:47,371
Deputy, you stay close to them,
and you keep them safe. You hear?

434
00:31:47,403 --> 00:31:49,440
Yes, sir.

435
00:31:49,472 --> 00:31:51,608
-OK.
-Come on, y'all.

436
00:31:51,642 --> 00:31:53,110
Deputy, we...

437
00:31:53,143 --> 00:31:55,011
did you get... did the
State get back with you?

438
00:31:55,045 --> 00:31:56,547
Forensics on their way?

439
00:31:56,579 --> 00:31:58,015
OK.

440
00:32:05,122 --> 00:32:07,124
No.
We don't see nothing over here.

441
00:32:07,156 --> 00:32:08,625
Over.

442
00:32:10,027 --> 00:32:11,162
Smell that?

443
00:32:11,194 --> 00:32:12,663
What is it?

444
00:32:12,695 --> 00:32:14,298
Blood.

445
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,298
Piss.

446
00:32:15,332 --> 00:32:17,001
My god.

447
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,473
My god.

448
00:32:35,786 --> 00:32:37,688
I'm going
to call the sheriff.

449
00:32:42,459 --> 00:32:44,762
Yeah, I think
we... I think we got it him.

450
00:32:44,795 --> 00:32:48,132
Or... well, part of him.

451
00:32:48,164 --> 00:32:50,533
Get those kids out of there.

452
00:32:50,567 --> 00:32:51,335
Yeah, let's go.

453
00:32:51,367 --> 00:32:53,604
Back up is on the
way to your 20.

454
00:32:53,636 --> 00:32:55,373
Hey there, Deputy.

455
00:32:57,173 --> 00:32:59,477
What do you think is
really going on up there.

456
00:32:59,509 --> 00:33:04,382
Well, two boys, the
last people to see

457
00:33:04,414 --> 00:33:06,549
some murder victims dead.

458
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:10,086
Then they got into a fight
with them before they got dead.

459
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:11,354
So I don't know.

460
00:33:11,387 --> 00:33:13,090
You tell me, smart guy.

461
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:17,227
There's no way that they
could have done that.

462
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,763
Well,
that might be true,

463
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:23,034
but you don't just walk away
from something like this.

464
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:26,303
So your boy, man, he should've thought
long and hard before he came back

465
00:33:26,336 --> 00:33:27,771
to old Kaler Mills.

466
00:33:36,846 --> 00:33:38,482
The interview room!

467
00:33:45,422 --> 00:33:46,757
Hey.

468
00:34:01,238 --> 00:34:03,641
Welcome back, Jordan.

469
00:34:03,673 --> 00:34:05,341
Thank you for the invitation.

470
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:08,179
Kyle out there
tells me that boy, Samuel...

471
00:34:08,211 --> 00:34:12,115
and I know in turn that means
you... threatened them yesterday.

472
00:34:18,155 --> 00:34:22,326
Samuel told me Kyle had
come home, which I always

473
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:24,127
expected he would do.

474
00:34:27,297 --> 00:34:30,735
What this boy was
referring was a request...

475
00:34:32,135 --> 00:34:35,172
A request that to this
day I have no idea why

476
00:34:35,204 --> 00:34:37,174
he decided to involve me in.

477
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:43,314
Samuel was just reminding
him of that bit of vileness.

478
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:44,682
That's all.

479
00:34:46,315 --> 00:34:49,152
The only threat was
the one made by Kyle.

480
00:34:51,521 --> 00:34:52,856
What kind of...

481
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:55,391
Sheriff! Sheriff!

482
00:34:55,425 --> 00:34:58,229
Son of a bitch!
You got to do something!

483
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,096
Can you
tell me what' going on?

484
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,632
You got to do something!
My boy's dead!

485
00:35:01,664 --> 00:35:04,235
You son of a bitch!
You sons of bitches.

486
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,603
What the hell happened?
What happened?

487
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,606
I'll tear your
fucking heads off.

488
00:35:16,313 --> 00:35:18,349
This whole fucking
town's going crazy, man.

489
00:35:27,324 --> 00:35:28,693
Kyle...

490
00:35:38,235 --> 00:35:40,738
The person I was
when I come to see you

491
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:42,539
ain't the person I am now.

492
00:35:45,442 --> 00:35:47,177
We understand.

493
00:35:51,514 --> 00:35:53,783
We're an imperfect
species, Kyle.

494
00:35:56,253 --> 00:35:59,557
Each of us is bound to make
many mistakes in our lifetime,

495
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,160
but we pay for those mistakes.

496
00:36:05,262 --> 00:36:07,731
Those men and women...

497
00:36:08,898 --> 00:36:11,835
their mistake
was crossing a boy like you.

498
00:36:14,704 --> 00:36:18,476
They've lived longer lives than
they deserve, now haven't they?

499
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:28,818
You've come here to receive your
own punishment for your crimes,

500
00:36:28,851 --> 00:36:33,389
for your actions,
for your request.

501
00:36:33,422 --> 00:36:37,393
But Kyle, it hasn't
been fulfilled yet.

502
00:36:37,427 --> 00:36:39,363
They have not paid.

503
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:44,400
Now it's time for them
to face their mistakes.

504
00:36:44,434 --> 00:36:46,503
It's time for their
innocence to be taken.

505
00:36:46,536 --> 00:36:49,505
I'm not asking
you to do anything.

506
00:36:49,539 --> 00:36:50,908
You did.

507
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,978
You did.

508
00:36:56,813 --> 00:36:58,715
Now you see that
your mistake was

509
00:36:58,748 --> 00:37:01,751
asking for such a selfish
thing in the first place.

510
00:37:01,784 --> 00:37:03,553
Yes, it was.

511
00:37:05,889 --> 00:37:08,559
All right?
It was a mistake.

512
00:37:08,592 --> 00:37:10,394
But no matter what you
think you should do,

513
00:37:10,427 --> 00:37:12,563
you leave everybody
else out of it.

514
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:17,902
Too late.

515
00:37:18,601 --> 00:37:20,503
Too late, Kyle.
Too late.

516
00:37:20,536 --> 00:37:22,739
Too late.
Too late.

517
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:26,876
The minute you set foot back in
my town, the end was in sight.

518
00:37:28,378 --> 00:37:30,381
It's ready.

519
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:37,421
It's been ready all these
years, and it's hungry.

520
00:37:37,454 --> 00:37:39,556
Lord God, it's hungry.

521
00:37:39,588 --> 00:37:41,458
I got this
all on camera, Kyle.

522
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,659
We can take it to the Sheriff.

523
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:43,794
Do not!

524
00:37:46,929 --> 00:37:49,366
Your sheriff has
not authority here.

525
00:37:53,603 --> 00:37:56,440
This is law now.

526
00:38:11,121 --> 00:38:12,990
What was that in
the woods last night?

527
00:38:18,527 --> 00:38:20,330
Revenge.

528
00:38:46,422 --> 00:38:48,524
Hey.
That was my dad.

529
00:38:48,557 --> 00:38:50,460
Something big must've happened.

530
00:39:25,795 --> 00:39:27,530
We're going back to Jordan's.

531
00:39:28,597 --> 00:39:31,467
Come on, man. Whatever
happened... that was years ago.

532
00:39:31,501 --> 00:39:32,970
And this ain't...
this ain't you.

533
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:35,005
Do you know that?
Look at that.

534
00:39:35,038 --> 00:39:37,039
How do we know
that this ain't me?

535
00:39:37,072 --> 00:39:39,809
That there ain't
nothing I can do?

536
00:39:39,842 --> 00:39:42,846
Wait, Kyle.
What is it? What did you do?

537
00:39:42,878 --> 00:39:44,847
Henry.

538
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,516
Yes, sir.

539
00:39:49,018 --> 00:39:50,494
Any of you all got any
more answers for me.

540
00:39:50,495 --> 00:39:50,987
No, sir.

541
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:53,757
I think Jordan
there was pretty fucking crazy.

542
00:39:53,789 --> 00:39:55,659
What do you think?

543
00:39:55,692 --> 00:39:59,396
Jordan is still in custody
and was when all this happened.

544
00:40:02,998 --> 00:40:05,568
His people, in my experience,

545
00:40:05,601 --> 00:40:06,769
they ain't going to do
something like this

546
00:40:06,802 --> 00:40:09,440
without him being
there to oversee it.

547
00:40:11,641 --> 00:40:14,644
Now, Kyle, I want
you to head home,

548
00:40:14,677 --> 00:40:16,547
and I want you to stay in.

549
00:40:16,579 --> 00:40:18,614
-Henry, I want you with me tonight.
-OK?

550
00:40:18,648 --> 00:40:19,983
Yes, sir.

551
00:40:22,585 --> 00:40:24,487
Hey.
Look.

552
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:30,227
No matter what you think they did,
just don't go making it worse.

553
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:33,497
Please?
See y'all later.

554
00:41:01,257 --> 00:41:03,526
Last time I was here,
I got met at the front door

555
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:05,962
by Samuel and a rifle.

556
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:07,498
Jesus.

557
00:41:15,938 --> 00:41:23,246
Now their security must
be,...getting lax.

558
00:42:21,771 --> 00:42:23,007
Kyle?

559
00:42:29,846 --> 00:42:31,748
Find anything?

560
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,683
What are we looking for?

561
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,852
Look. Jordan is
responsible for all this.

562
00:42:35,885 --> 00:42:37,621
He said as much, right?

563
00:42:39,688 --> 00:42:43,759
He said he'd get me some payback
for being treated so bad.

564
00:42:43,793 --> 00:42:46,630
He promised to show them.

565
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:50,568
Show who?

566
00:42:51,266 --> 00:42:52,769
Kaler Mills.

567
00:42:55,905 --> 00:42:57,775
He said it'd be bad.

568
00:43:03,246 --> 00:43:04,748
Promised it'd be bad.

569
00:43:07,684 --> 00:43:10,653
Promised because you
wanted it to be bad?

570
00:43:13,289 --> 00:43:16,627
Bad like people being
killed in the woods?

571
00:43:21,097 --> 00:43:25,002
Is this what I think it is?

572
00:43:27,804 --> 00:43:29,639
What?
Shit.

573
00:43:32,442 --> 00:43:34,411
We got to go.
We got to go.

574
00:43:34,443 --> 00:43:35,980
Come on.

575
00:44:08,778 --> 00:44:10,947
What the fuck you
doing in my house, boy?

576
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,882
Sam... Samuel.

577
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:16,353
Spit it out!

578
00:44:16,385 --> 00:44:19,288
Please don't hurt him.
Please.

579
00:44:19,322 --> 00:44:22,860
Sweetheart, I almost
forgot you was here.

580
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,896
Mighty pretty girl
you got here, Kyle Cole.

581
00:44:26,929 --> 00:44:29,398
Samuel.
Samuel.

582
00:44:29,431 --> 00:44:30,966
Get on your knees, Kyle Cole.

583
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,802
I said get on your
fucking knees.

584
00:44:32,835 --> 00:44:35,237
All right!
All right!

585
00:44:35,271 --> 00:44:36,840
Samuel, don't hurt her.

586
00:44:36,873 --> 00:44:39,309
Come back to me, OK?
Samuel!

587
00:44:39,342 --> 00:44:40,744
Samuel!
Samuel!

588
00:44:40,777 --> 00:44:43,346
Please, Kyle Cole.

589
00:44:43,378 --> 00:44:45,181
I will do as I please.

590
00:44:55,425 --> 00:44:58,295
I want it to stop.
OK.

591
00:44:58,327 --> 00:45:00,764
I want it to stop.
That's all.

592
00:45:00,797 --> 00:45:02,166
Stop Jordan, OK?

593
00:45:05,934 --> 00:45:08,438
Stop Jordan?

594
00:45:08,471 --> 00:45:11,340
What about me, Kyle Cole?

595
00:45:11,373 --> 00:45:13,209
I could stop Jordan.

596
00:45:16,913 --> 00:45:19,849
Maybe I could stop
Jordan for you?

597
00:45:19,882 --> 00:45:22,885
See, the way I figure,
Kyle Cole...

598
00:45:22,918 --> 00:45:25,221
you think you're on
to something here.

599
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:30,393
You think that you've got some
sort of educated understanding

600
00:45:30,425 --> 00:45:33,230
of the goddamn
situation, but I'm here

601
00:45:33,262 --> 00:45:36,799
to tell you, Kyle Cole, that
you don't have a fucking clue.

602
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:43,974
This is because of me, Samuel.

603
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:45,409
Just tell me.

604
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,514
Get the fuck up, Kyle.

605
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,884
You are one ungrateful
piece of shit.

606
00:45:53,916 --> 00:45:55,351
Do you know that?

607
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:59,222
Do you know how many
people on our land

608
00:45:59,255 --> 00:46:03,326
would kill for the kind of
heed that he is giving you.

609
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:05,895
I want it stop!

610
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,398
There's no going
back, Kyle Cole.

611
00:46:08,431 --> 00:46:10,967
No undoing what has been done.

612
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,434
Do you understand me?

613
00:46:12,467 --> 00:46:14,904
Now get the fuck
out of my house.

614
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:25,182
Samuel has his ideas.

615
00:46:26,215 --> 00:46:28,885
I like to give him free
reign to experiment.

616
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:37,528
He has his ways...
but they're not mine.

617
00:46:39,061 --> 00:46:40,931
They're not ours.

618
00:46:41,931 --> 00:46:46,869
What? Not you? You killed
those animals and everyone...

619
00:46:46,902 --> 00:46:49,872
Them?
No one else, Kyle.

620
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:53,876
We ain't murderers.

621
00:46:56,012 --> 00:46:57,514
You, on the other hand...

622
00:46:57,547 --> 00:46:59,949
What do you want, Jordan?

623
00:47:01,016 --> 00:47:02,852
What do you want?!

624
00:47:02,885 --> 00:47:07,257
All I wanted was to come back
here and make some peace.

625
00:47:07,289 --> 00:47:09,358
And some stupid requests
that I made from you

626
00:47:09,391 --> 00:47:11,460
years ago hangs over my head.

627
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:15,565
No.

628
00:47:15,597 --> 00:47:17,067
I'm not a murderer.

629
00:47:19,068 --> 00:47:20,971
I'm not a psychopath.

630
00:47:29,978 --> 00:47:32,949
You feel that when
you touch him too?

631
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,554
Look at me, bitch!

632
00:47:37,586 --> 00:47:40,489
Do you feel it?

633
00:47:40,523 --> 00:47:42,358
You feel how deep it is in him?

634
00:47:44,994 --> 00:47:52,001
So deep the only way
out is death... or me.

635
00:48:06,315 --> 00:48:07,550
Tanner.

636
00:48:09,952 --> 00:48:11,454
Yeah, buddy?

637
00:48:13,588 --> 00:48:15,391
You have anything
that'll play this?

638
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:18,028
Home... home movies?

639
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,963
Maybe.
Maybe just some stuff I shot.

640
00:48:20,996 --> 00:48:24,934
Actually I do, but if
it's good, I want to keep it.

641
00:48:55,097 --> 00:49:00,237
What you have here,
son, is very dangerous.

642
00:49:09,177 --> 00:49:10,179
No.

643
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:15,585
I mean what you have here.

644
00:49:18,153 --> 00:49:23,126
I once knew a boy like you who
was filled with same dark bile.

645
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:25,996
He traveled the world,
and he spread his hatred

646
00:49:26,028 --> 00:49:28,731
to so many unsuspecting people.

647
00:49:28,764 --> 00:49:36,205
His fury was misdirected,
and then a miracle.

648
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:42,711
In an inconspicuous place on
this Earth, an old farmhouse,

649
00:49:42,744 --> 00:49:46,682
in a box locked away
in an attic,

650
00:49:46,715 --> 00:49:54,590
he found something...
something old...

651
00:49:54,623 --> 00:50:00,096
something older
than all of us... a purpose...

652
00:50:00,128 --> 00:50:05,301
a purpose no man had ever
experienced... a potential.

653
00:50:07,302 --> 00:50:11,540
Some things we're not meant to
understand, only to witness.

654
00:50:14,811 --> 00:50:18,548
What you have in your hand
is nothing compared to what

655
00:50:18,581 --> 00:50:21,284
he did during his time of hate.

656
00:50:21,317 --> 00:50:22,552
Samuel.

657
00:50:27,155 --> 00:50:31,226
The cage was locked,
and he could see

658
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:33,496
glimpses of what were inside.

659
00:50:33,528 --> 00:50:34,797
Glimpses.

660
00:50:37,233 --> 00:50:43,773
To unlock his full potential...
he needed a key.

661
00:50:43,806 --> 00:50:50,512
The search for that key changed
his life, turned his spirit.

662
00:50:50,545 --> 00:50:53,315
He knew if he could
help other people,

663
00:50:53,349 --> 00:50:55,852
if he could help shield
them from predators like he

664
00:50:55,885 --> 00:51:00,657
used to be, he'd find the key.

665
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:03,592
I have found the key.

666
00:51:12,467 --> 00:51:14,070
It's you.

667
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:20,276
You're the key.

668
00:51:20,309 --> 00:51:27,818
You're the key to your
salvation and mine and ours.

669
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:37,126
Will you do your part, Kyle?

670
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:58,648
I came with you because
I thought I loved you.

671
00:51:58,681 --> 00:52:05,221
I thought I could help you,
but I don't think I can.

672
00:52:05,253 --> 00:52:07,556
Mandy...

673
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:09,459
I want to leave.

674
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:13,363
Wait.

675
00:52:17,532 --> 00:52:20,202
If I leave now, I'll
never come back.

676
00:52:20,235 --> 00:52:22,871
I can't.

677
00:52:22,905 --> 00:52:26,643
Not without seeing
my parents first.

678
00:52:26,675 --> 00:52:32,315
In my craziest, most anxiety-filled
imagination of me...

679
00:52:32,347 --> 00:52:34,416
in this situation,

680
00:52:34,449 --> 00:52:36,718
I still wouldn't be here, Kyle.

681
00:52:36,751 --> 00:52:38,688
And yet we are,
and you are still

682
00:52:38,721 --> 00:52:39,889
talking about finishing this.

683
00:52:39,922 --> 00:52:45,427
Look. You said you understood
how important this is...

684
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:48,797
that I get some kind
of closure with... that you

685
00:52:48,831 --> 00:52:51,568
don't get with your dad.

686
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:53,436
That's when I
though I knew you.

687
00:52:53,469 --> 00:52:54,938
How do I know that
you're not the person

688
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:56,806
that I've been hearing about?

689
00:53:00,842 --> 00:53:02,578
You don't know
that I'm different?

690
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:05,914
I would have never
have guessed that you

691
00:53:05,947 --> 00:53:09,286
would let yourself go there.

692
00:53:09,784 --> 00:53:13,856
So no.

693
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:17,694
It surprised me.

694
00:53:17,726 --> 00:53:18,927
It scared me.

695
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,829
I mean, I'm scared, OK?

696
00:53:20,862 --> 00:53:22,264
Mandy.

697
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:25,300
I'm sorry.

698
00:53:25,333 --> 00:53:28,870
Mandy, what I did was wrong.

699
00:53:28,903 --> 00:53:31,007
OK?

700
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:33,442
I mean, good Lord it was wrong.

701
00:53:35,978 --> 00:53:37,880
But I never intended
for them to kill anyone.

702
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:42,418
I mean, with a little
room to breathe,

703
00:53:42,451 --> 00:53:47,023
the... just that idea that this
is even connected is insane.

704
00:53:47,056 --> 00:53:48,958
I mean, that's absurd, right?

705
00:53:55,764 --> 00:53:56,766
Don't.

706
00:53:56,798 --> 00:53:58,300
Come on.

707
00:54:03,572 --> 00:54:04,840
Am I going to get hurt, Kyle?

708
00:54:04,873 --> 00:54:06,375
No.

709
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:09,579
Mandy, what happened
today at the house...

710
00:54:09,612 --> 00:54:12,548
I'm... I shouldn't
have let you come.

711
00:54:12,581 --> 00:54:13,783
I'm sorry.

712
00:54:18,721 --> 00:54:22,925
Just... stay with me tonight.

713
00:54:22,958 --> 00:54:24,394
OK?

714
00:54:26,762 --> 00:54:28,398
I need you.

715
00:55:07,969 --> 00:55:10,372
First off, I'm going
to ask you just to tell me

716
00:55:10,405 --> 00:55:13,608
a little bit about your boys.

717
00:55:13,641 --> 00:55:18,580
My boys were everything
to me... to Emmett too.

718
00:55:18,614 --> 00:55:23,353
Just because we lost Ryan...
and in some ways, Kyle,

719
00:55:23,385 --> 00:55:25,721
it doesn't mean that they
still aren't everything.

720
00:55:28,456 --> 00:55:30,460
You just learn to carry on.

721
00:55:33,795 --> 00:55:35,998
I'm sorry. I'm not...
I'm not good with my words.

722
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:39,534
I don't... I don't
know how to do this.

723
00:55:39,568 --> 00:55:41,104
It's OK.

724
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:44,941
I think that's what I do.

725
00:55:44,974 --> 00:55:47,777
I just carry on.

726
00:55:47,809 --> 00:55:50,679
Do you think it was a good
idea to move Kyle to go and live

727
00:55:50,713 --> 00:55:52,081
with your sister.

728
00:55:52,114 --> 00:55:54,684
I still think it was
the right thing to do.

729
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:00,356
He might not have made
it if he had stayed.

730
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:08,965
That's so sad to say.

731
00:56:17,472 --> 00:56:23,980
There was just so much...

732
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:28,418
There was too much.

733
00:56:37,492 --> 00:56:39,461
I'm so sorry, Kyle.

734
00:56:39,494 --> 00:56:41,730
It's all right.
We can stop.

735
00:56:58,012 --> 00:57:00,983
I'm so sorry.

736
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:14,164
Hey.

737
00:57:18,766 --> 00:57:21,136
I guess this went about
as expected?

738
00:57:24,106 --> 00:57:27,610
I had dinner with dad
here a few years back.

739
00:57:27,643 --> 00:57:30,447
It's not really how
I remembered it.

740
00:57:31,847 --> 00:57:34,451
I didn't know that.
How was dad?

741
00:57:35,284 --> 00:57:38,988
He seemed quiet Mr. Emmett Cole,
you know, older.

742
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:50,833
I need to go see him.

743
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:53,970
Can I shoot it?

744
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:58,741
As long as he don't
know you're there.

745
00:58:36,811 --> 00:58:38,813
How are you feeling?

746
00:58:38,847 --> 00:58:40,550
Like it was yesterday.

747
00:58:43,351 --> 00:58:45,254
If it were yesterday?

748
00:58:47,922 --> 00:58:49,625
I guess I'd be a better person.

749
00:58:54,362 --> 00:58:57,632
Try to be more like
Ryan instead of...

750
00:58:57,666 --> 00:58:59,635
always seeing him so different.

751
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:28,998
Kyle, that was the sheriff.

752
00:59:31,032 --> 00:59:33,001
We need to talk
about a few things.

753
00:59:41,043 --> 00:59:43,713
OK, Tanner.
This is it.

754
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:47,717
This is your money shot,
and I want to leave.

755
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:51,052
Mandy, I don't
think Kyle's ready yet.

756
00:59:51,085 --> 00:59:52,788
I've got work to do.

757
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:54,322
Go in and feel him out.

758
00:59:54,356 --> 00:59:56,659
I think you'll see he needs a
little more time, and so do I.

759
00:59:56,692 --> 00:59:58,661
I'm not sure about that.

760
00:59:58,693 --> 01:00:04,800
He tried to talk to him before
he came here, and... I mean,

761
01:00:04,833 --> 01:00:08,037
the point is is that I'm
scared of where we are

762
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:10,373
and what we're doing.
I mean, aren't you?

763
01:00:10,405 --> 01:00:13,308
I'm scared too, but
I came here to shoot this.

764
01:00:13,342 --> 01:00:14,143
Yeah.

765
01:00:14,175 --> 01:00:16,778
-You ready?
-Whatever.

766
01:00:16,811 --> 01:00:19,047
Just pull the tarp
off and let's get this shot.

767
01:00:22,818 --> 01:00:24,720
Is that...
Shit.

768
01:00:24,753 --> 01:00:27,222
That's the one
Jordan had branded on him.

769
01:00:28,824 --> 01:00:31,427
You really did do something
terrible, didn't you?

770
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:32,795
What?
Mandy, what?

771
01:00:32,827 --> 01:00:34,697
Goddamn it, Kyle.
What the hell is that?

772
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:36,097
What the
fuck is that, Kyle?

773
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:37,733
Are you one of them?

774
01:00:40,402 --> 01:00:41,436
No.

775
01:00:41,469 --> 01:00:44,739
Mandy, listen to me.
What the hell is all this?

776
01:00:44,773 --> 01:00:48,309
All right! Everybody knew what
was going on in Dooms Chapel.

777
01:00:48,342 --> 01:00:50,413
All right?
Everybody!

778
01:00:50,445 --> 01:00:53,915
Everybody knew about
all the secret bullshit

779
01:00:53,949 --> 01:00:56,719
that was happening down there that
Jordan and Samuel were doing.

780
01:00:56,751 --> 01:00:57,853
Everybody talked
about that, right?

781
01:00:57,885 --> 01:00:59,320
-Yeah.
-Yes.

782
01:00:59,353 --> 01:01:01,389
I'd had enough.

783
01:01:01,422 --> 01:01:04,726
I was done with all the
stares and the glares and all

784
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:07,697
the comments that I heard make...
people making under their breath.

785
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:10,199
And I'd had enough, and I
went and asked for revenge.

786
01:01:12,501 --> 01:01:16,839
And they... they did this to me.

787
01:01:16,871 --> 01:01:21,176
And Jordan...
he did it to himself.

788
01:01:27,815 --> 01:01:29,350
You remember that day.

789
01:01:29,384 --> 01:01:31,753
I know you do.

790
01:01:31,786 --> 01:01:34,289
I came home.
I... I... I was in shock.

791
01:01:34,322 --> 01:01:36,792
I didn't... I didn't
go back to school.

792
01:01:39,393 --> 01:01:42,297
And now all of this.

793
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:43,798
Mandy.
Mandy!

794
01:01:43,831 --> 01:01:45,034
Get the hell away from me.

795
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:57,880
Kyle
was subjected to abuse.

796
01:01:57,913 --> 01:02:05,788
And a video was fed into the new
video board at the football field.

797
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:08,456
There was a game.

798
01:02:08,489 --> 01:02:12,861
So everything that happened

799
01:02:12,894 --> 01:02:16,766
could be seen by... everyone.

800
01:02:17,865 --> 01:02:21,202
Kyle had his clothes removed...

801
01:02:21,235 --> 01:02:24,906
and he was bound up
with duct tape.

802
01:02:26,108 --> 01:02:28,778
He was in the locker
room at the field.

803
01:02:31,947 --> 01:02:39,555
And it appeared that feces
had been smeared on his body,

804
01:02:39,588 --> 01:02:41,257
and he was crying.

805
01:02:43,525 --> 01:02:46,896
The, the students
were taunting him,

806
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,963
and they were
encouraging him to...

807
01:02:48,996 --> 01:02:50,766
Encouragement?

808
01:02:54,168 --> 01:02:56,437
They were forcing
him to say that he was

809
01:02:56,471 --> 01:02:58,907
responsible for Ryan's death.

810
01:03:17,025 --> 01:03:20,829
You couldn't have
stopped him from going.

811
01:03:20,862 --> 01:03:25,801
No matter what he told you,
we tried to keep him here.

812
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:31,307
Couldn't stop him
from leaving as a boy.

813
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:35,344
No reason we could
stop him as a man.

814
01:03:35,376 --> 01:03:39,181
He's got his grandfather's
determination...

815
01:03:39,213 --> 01:03:43,186
something neither me
or his brother had.

816
01:03:44,152 --> 01:03:46,021
What are you guys doing up?

817
01:03:48,123 --> 01:03:50,358
Tanner, where's Kyle?

818
01:03:50,391 --> 01:03:53,328
Mandy, Kyle's gone.

819
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:55,164
And you just let him go?

820
01:03:55,197 --> 01:03:57,566
There was no letting about it.

821
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,468
Well, if you aren't
going after your own son,

822
01:03:59,501 --> 01:04:01,971
the sheriff should at
least know about his.

823
01:04:02,003 --> 01:04:03,572
Emmett?

824
01:04:10,378 --> 01:04:12,214
Sheriff.

825
01:04:13,215 --> 01:04:15,017
No.

826
01:04:15,050 --> 01:04:16,952
Emmett Cole.

827
01:04:16,985 --> 01:04:18,053
We got to talk.

828
01:04:18,085 --> 01:04:20,021
Something going on here.

829
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:40,241
Where are we?

830
01:04:40,275 --> 01:04:42,177
Well, the
park's over there.

831
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:45,146
Saw mill that way.

832
01:04:45,179 --> 01:04:49,083
Just over here right
past Perryman's Creek

833
01:04:49,117 --> 01:04:50,952
is Dooms Chapel.

834
01:04:50,985 --> 01:04:54,656
I guess we're right
in the middle of it.

835
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:56,925
It's up to you, brother.

836
01:04:56,958 --> 01:04:58,360
Where you want to go?

837
01:05:01,096 --> 01:05:02,530
Dooms Chapel.

838
01:05:05,099 --> 01:05:07,536
Listen, Henry.

839
01:05:07,568 --> 01:05:08,938
You ain't got to come.

840
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:10,539
I don't know what
happens after this.

841
01:05:15,010 --> 01:05:18,013
Heart's beating in my
chest like a jackhammer.

842
01:05:18,045 --> 01:05:19,981
I'm going to stick
with you, Kyle.

843
01:05:20,014 --> 01:05:22,050
I know by now ain't nothing
usual about hanging out

844
01:05:22,083 --> 01:05:23,551
with Kyle Cole.

845
01:05:31,059 --> 01:05:33,028
All right.

846
01:05:33,061 --> 01:05:34,563
That way.

847
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:43,472
Right there.

848
01:05:43,505 --> 01:05:45,340
Right fucking there.
Did you see it?

849
01:05:45,373 --> 01:05:46,708
Stay behind me, Kyle.

850
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:48,410
No. Henry!

851
01:05:48,443 --> 01:05:50,612
Henry!
Shit!

852
01:05:55,182 --> 01:05:56,985
Henry.

853
01:05:57,018 --> 01:05:58,353
Henry?

854
01:06:09,197 --> 01:06:14,303
Those woods, in just
two days, has taken

855
01:06:14,335 --> 01:06:16,538
five of our sons and daughters.

856
01:06:18,472 --> 01:06:25,114
Randy Curtis, Ricky Johnson,
Chester Johnson,

857
01:06:25,146 --> 01:06:30,085
Vicky Street,
only six years old.

858
01:06:30,117 --> 01:06:35,523
And now possibly young
Billy Vogler.

859
01:06:35,556 --> 01:06:41,062
Whatever that abomination
that is out there is,

860
01:06:41,096 --> 01:06:44,699
it is responsible for
taking our children from us.

861
01:06:46,668 --> 01:06:52,340
It's decided
to call our town home...

862
01:06:52,373 --> 01:06:57,078
and it is not welcome.

863
01:06:58,679 --> 01:07:00,748
We didn't stay
here in Kaler Mills

864
01:07:00,782 --> 01:07:04,253
to raise our sons and daughters
to be afraid to go outside

865
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:05,354
in their own home town.

866
01:07:05,387 --> 01:07:08,157
We didn't work
our fingers bloody

867
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:11,260
building our livelihoods
to have it torn away

868
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:14,663
from us from the inside out.

869
01:07:15,697 --> 01:07:21,236
All of you brothers and
sisters, all of you,

870
01:07:21,268 --> 01:07:25,606
I call upon you to arm
and to gather yourself.

871
01:07:25,639 --> 01:07:30,511
Come with us to
take our town back,

872
01:07:30,545 --> 01:07:35,084
and send that animal to hell.

873
01:07:53,635 --> 01:07:54,570
Henry.

874
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:00,241
Fuck. Fuck.

875
01:08:10,684 --> 01:08:12,153
Henry!

876
01:08:22,229 --> 01:08:23,297
God...

877
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:04,273
What possessed you?

878
01:09:07,609 --> 01:09:10,146
What propels you?

879
01:09:12,279 --> 01:09:14,682
What compels you to me?

880
01:09:18,619 --> 01:09:26,261
What caused you so much
pain in here and in here?

881
01:09:28,662 --> 01:09:31,432
Not God.

882
01:09:31,466 --> 01:09:34,536
Not the Devil.

883
01:09:34,569 --> 01:09:38,473
Not the spirits you sipped.

884
01:09:38,506 --> 01:09:41,210
But the innocence in your souls.

885
01:09:43,444 --> 01:09:49,784
There are those who need your
trust so they may betray it.

886
01:09:51,619 --> 01:09:57,658
There are those who
prey upon your naivet,

887
01:09:57,692 --> 01:10:04,300
but this innocence you've
given me, then I've taken it.

888
01:10:06,333 --> 01:10:11,340
And though it weighs
upon me,

889
01:10:11,372 --> 01:10:13,808
it weighs...

890
01:10:14,975 --> 01:10:21,516
like the lead of 10,000 bullets
lodged in my flesh.

891
01:10:23,417 --> 01:10:27,822
I've taken it,
and it's set you free.

892
01:10:27,855 --> 01:10:29,023
Hasn't it?

893
01:10:29,056 --> 01:10:30,960
Hasn't it set you free?

894
01:10:35,596 --> 01:10:39,367
You see this boy, my friends?

895
01:10:43,438 --> 01:10:46,574
This boy came to me once...

896
01:10:47,708 --> 01:10:51,246
just like you all did...

897
01:10:52,747 --> 01:10:55,251
but he did not bring innocence.

898
01:10:57,319 --> 01:10:59,755
That was long gone from him.

899
01:11:02,056 --> 01:11:05,728
He brought hatred and guilt.

900
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,303
This boy killed his brother.

901
01:11:14,336 --> 01:11:16,372
Shut up, Jordan!

902
01:11:22,409 --> 01:11:28,850
Came to me with the blood
guilt that was so deep.

903
01:11:30,518 --> 01:11:36,358
Its tentacles so wormed into
his young flesh and bone.

904
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:42,030
I could not deny him,
and we tried.

905
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:47,403
Didn't we try, Samuel?

906
01:11:49,537 --> 01:11:52,708
He could've been with
us even here tonight.

907
01:11:54,975 --> 01:11:57,712
But he fled before
I could help him.

908
01:12:03,551 --> 01:12:05,354
What do you say, Kyle?

909
01:12:07,756 --> 01:12:10,425
Too late for you to be saved?

910
01:12:10,457 --> 01:12:13,428
You've all been
brainwashed by this crazy fuck.

911
01:12:18,565 --> 01:12:20,168
He denies me.

912
01:12:24,037 --> 01:12:25,640
Do you deny this?

913
01:12:28,042 --> 01:12:31,413
You deny me, but
will you deny this?

914
01:12:35,649 --> 01:12:37,485
Will he deny this?

915
01:12:41,555 --> 01:12:45,526
Will he deny that
it is his own paper?

916
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:49,765
Will he deny that
it is his writing?

917
01:12:49,797 --> 01:12:54,902
Did you not mark these own
souls with your pencil?

918
01:12:54,935 --> 01:12:57,471
That may be my list...

919
01:12:57,505 --> 01:12:59,641
but all this...
everyone that died,

920
01:12:59,673 --> 01:13:01,643
that was you, and I'll
die and go to hell

921
01:13:01,676 --> 01:13:03,812
before I let it get any worse.

922
01:13:15,823 --> 01:13:18,726
You know what comes next.

923
01:13:24,064 --> 01:13:30,037
Suzanna, come and sing
for us, child.

924
01:13:35,009 --> 01:13:36,912
Come and sing for us.

925
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:43,452
Let it begin.

926
01:14:50,083 --> 01:14:52,621
I'm going to
let you see, Kyle.

927
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:58,059
I'm going to
introduce you tonight.

928
01:14:58,091 --> 01:15:02,196
This... this is
what killed Henry?

929
01:15:02,229 --> 01:15:04,065
No.

930
01:15:04,832 --> 01:15:08,936
You killed Henry.
No.

931
01:15:08,970 --> 01:15:12,007
-You killed everybody else too.
-No. No. No.

932
01:15:12,039 --> 01:15:13,108
You killed Henry.

933
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:15,643
Brandon Curtis.

934
01:15:17,744 --> 01:15:20,849
Ricky Johnson.

935
01:15:20,881 --> 01:15:23,818
Becky Johnson.

936
01:15:27,622 --> 01:15:29,892
Miss Fulsome.

937
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:35,063
Sheriff McManus.

938
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:43,305
Emmett... Cole.

939
01:15:43,337 --> 01:15:46,840
I will kill you,
you son of a bitch.

940
01:15:46,873 --> 01:15:48,543
You hear me?

941
01:15:55,850 --> 01:15:57,886
Mine...

942
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,008
His!

943
01:16:24,645 --> 01:16:26,614
There he is.

944
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:29,585
There he is.

945
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:37,993
We best be going now.

946
01:16:40,761 --> 01:16:43,030
Enjoy the show.

947
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:46,034
Goodbye, Kyle.

948
01:16:50,037 --> 01:16:52,239
I will kill you.

949
01:16:54,676 --> 01:16:56,745
I'm gonna do it.

950
01:17:22,869 --> 01:17:24,972
Do your best, boy.

951
01:17:34,047 --> 01:17:37,318
Like the man said, Kyle.

952
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:38,920
Do your best.

953
01:17:38,953 --> 01:17:40,689
Samuel.

954
01:17:43,824 --> 01:17:44,925
Samuel!

955
01:17:50,864 --> 01:17:55,836
Everybody is getting two
of these here things.

956
01:17:55,869 --> 01:17:58,305
Put one around your neck.

957
01:17:58,338 --> 01:18:03,744
And if it goes out,
put the other one on.

958
01:18:03,778 --> 01:18:11,119
Rule number one... don't
shoot the green glow sticks.

959
01:18:13,854 --> 01:18:15,889
Nobody's getting hurt tonight.
Understood?

960
01:18:15,922 --> 01:18:17,324
Yes, sir.

961
01:18:19,961 --> 01:18:23,765
I want you men and women
to understand the severity

962
01:18:23,797 --> 01:18:26,266
of the situation tonight.

963
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:30,337
Three young men... one
of them my own son...

964
01:18:30,371 --> 01:18:33,475
is out in those woods.

965
01:18:33,507 --> 01:18:38,412
If it was not for the urgency
required in finding these boys,

966
01:18:38,445 --> 01:18:40,381
we would not be
walking out there

967
01:18:40,413 --> 01:18:43,884
in the middle of the night with
a bunch of you armed civilians.

968
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:51,792
Do not take a shot unless
this thing is on top of you.

969
01:18:51,826 --> 01:18:53,027
Am I clear?

970
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:55,163
Yes, sir.

971
01:19:04,505 --> 01:19:06,208
Holy shit.

972
01:19:09,443 --> 01:19:12,847
Everybody be careful.

973
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:21,856
Come on, Mandy.

974
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:32,934
Stick together.
Stay close.

975
01:19:32,966 --> 01:19:33,835
Keep your eyes open.

976
01:19:37,872 --> 01:19:39,874
Tilson, that one of you?

977
01:19:39,907 --> 01:19:42,076
No, sir.
I think it came from behind us.

978
01:19:42,109 --> 01:19:43,411
No.

979
01:19:43,444 --> 01:19:45,814
Keep moving.

980
01:19:45,846 --> 01:19:47,881
If your party fires
a shot, first thing,

981
01:19:47,914 --> 01:19:50,851
let us know it was one of you
guys and not one of our boys.

982
01:19:50,885 --> 01:19:52,887
We'll still meet
up at Reds Farm.

983
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:54,454
Yes, sir.
10-4.

984
01:19:54,488 --> 01:19:56,057
OK.
Let's keep moving.

985
01:20:00,994 --> 01:20:03,398
Everybody stay alert.

986
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:05,933
What... What is that?

987
01:20:05,966 --> 01:20:07,501
Kyle?

988
01:20:11,471 --> 01:20:12,974
Be careful.

989
01:20:13,006 --> 01:20:13,942
No!

990
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:15,477
It's the boy.

991
01:20:17,444 --> 01:20:19,180
Yeah, that's him.

992
01:20:25,586 --> 01:20:28,957
I don't care what it is.
I'm finding my boy.

993
01:20:28,989 --> 01:20:31,326
Yeah.
We found the Vogler boy.

994
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:33,628
Leaving Whitess here.
Whitess, stay here.

995
01:20:33,661 --> 01:20:35,997
Let's go. Let's go.
Come on, guys.

996
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:00,922
What was that?

997
01:21:00,954 --> 01:21:02,457
What the hell is that?

998
01:21:08,628 --> 01:21:10,465
My god!
Who is that?

999
01:21:10,497 --> 01:21:13,634
Hey, hey.
You guys see that thing?

1000
01:21:13,667 --> 01:21:15,969
Somebody help me up.

1001
01:21:35,456 --> 01:21:37,425
My god!

1002
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:09,224
I see it.
It's over there, man.

1003
01:22:10,190 --> 01:22:12,426
My god!
God, fuck!

1004
01:22:38,386 --> 01:22:41,222
Fuck.
I don't want to do that.

1005
01:22:41,255 --> 01:22:43,056
What was it?
Did you see it?

1006
01:22:43,090 --> 01:22:44,125
Whitess?

1007
01:22:44,158 --> 01:22:45,994
Did you see it?

1008
01:22:46,027 --> 01:22:47,028
My God!

1009
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:48,595
-God!
-Shit!

1010
01:22:48,628 --> 01:22:50,131
My God!

1011
01:22:50,663 --> 01:22:53,067
My belly hurts.

1012
01:23:05,046 --> 01:23:07,215
Tanner!

1013
01:23:30,470 --> 01:23:32,573
Quiet, girl.
Quiet.

1014
01:23:33,740 --> 01:23:36,043
Shut that damn light off.

1015
01:23:36,077 --> 01:23:37,578
Sheriff!

1016
01:23:37,610 --> 01:23:40,081
Sheriff!
God!

1017
01:23:40,113 --> 01:23:41,681
Get the hell out.

1018
01:23:45,319 --> 01:23:47,121
Kyle!

1019
01:23:53,159 --> 01:23:54,828
Good shot.

1020
01:23:54,862 --> 01:23:56,597
Be quiet.

1021
01:23:57,430 --> 01:24:01,168
It's still there.
It's still there.

1022
01:24:04,204 --> 01:24:06,106
Henry's dead.

1023
01:24:08,609 --> 01:24:11,179
It killed Henry.

1024
01:24:12,279 --> 01:24:14,615
It came for me.

1025
01:24:14,648 --> 01:24:17,217
It wants me.

1026
01:24:20,287 --> 01:24:23,157
Get the fuck up, Kyle.

1027
01:24:23,189 --> 01:24:27,394
You are going to look at
me when I tell you this.

1028
01:24:27,427 --> 01:24:30,363
Everyone was right.

1029
01:24:30,396 --> 01:24:33,100
This is your fault.

1030
01:24:33,134 --> 01:24:35,737
The accident, Jordan...

1031
01:24:39,172 --> 01:24:40,807
Goddamn it!
Look at that.

1032
01:24:40,841 --> 01:24:44,311
-I know it's my fault!
-Look at all of it!

1033
01:24:44,345 --> 01:24:45,680
You did that!

1034
01:24:45,712 --> 01:24:51,286
Henry, your friend... us.

1035
01:24:53,887 --> 01:24:55,390
You broke that.

1036
01:24:58,725 --> 01:25:02,896
But this is what
you wanted, right?

1037
01:25:02,930 --> 01:25:05,567
You wanted everyone dead.

1038
01:25:10,171 --> 01:25:16,144
And you, Tanner, did you get the
freak show that you wanted...

1039
01:25:20,247 --> 01:25:22,317
Haul your
ass back to the road.

1040
01:25:23,751 --> 01:25:26,454
I'm done watching
you do this, Jordan.

1041
01:25:26,487 --> 01:25:28,756
It's me now.
Just me.

1042
01:25:28,788 --> 01:25:30,557
God damn it, son.

1043
01:25:30,591 --> 01:25:32,260
Stop it.

1044
01:25:32,292 --> 01:25:39,666
It wasn't your fault.
It was never your fault.

1045
01:25:52,378 --> 01:25:54,215
Dad!

1046
01:25:54,247 --> 01:25:56,483
Dad!

1047
01:25:56,516 --> 01:25:58,752
God.
Dad!

1048
01:25:58,786 --> 01:26:00,622
Dad!

1049
01:26:03,923 --> 01:26:06,426
Dad? Dad, please.
Come on.

1050
01:26:10,930 --> 01:26:12,432
Come on, please.

1051
01:26:12,466 --> 01:26:14,402
Dad.
Dad.

1052
01:26:18,805 --> 01:26:20,207
I can't feel anything, Dad.

1053
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:22,676
I... I don't know what to do.

1054
01:26:28,414 --> 01:26:31,252
I'm so sorry.

1055
01:27:03,884 --> 01:27:05,485
Come on!

1056
01:27:09,456 --> 01:27:11,759
It's me!
Come on!

1057
01:27:11,792 --> 01:27:13,962
I'm right here!

1058
01:27:16,462 --> 01:27:18,298
It's me!

1059
01:27:43,056 --> 01:27:45,893
I am the one
you should be be worried about.

1060
01:28:03,409 --> 01:28:04,878
It's mine!

1061
01:28:08,015 --> 01:28:09,450
You see?

1062
01:28:15,355 --> 01:28:17,590
What's the matter, Kyle?

1063
01:28:20,493 --> 01:28:23,963
What's done is done.

1064
01:28:37,711 --> 01:28:40,515
A change is a-comin'.

1065
01:28:43,516 --> 01:28:46,653
