Cardinal, I cannot let you go alone.

694
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,167
The priest will assist.
You must stay here.

695
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:00,500
You're the only one who knows the system,
the only one to protect the Archives.

696
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:04,082

if I don't return.

ROGER:
This is the only thing we have left.

698
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,820
- An exorcism?
- Yeah.

699
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,081

702
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,130
I'm ready for this.

703

No one is ready for the truth.

704
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,243
What's with the big production?

705
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,086
It helps preserve the integrity
of the church to

706
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,962
disprove possessions for what they are.

707
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,691
Usually some form of mental illness.

708
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,167

(SCOFFS)

710
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,565
You can say that.

711
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,005
Can you plug this in?

712
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:57,041
When I was 12 years old,
I was possessed by a demon.

713
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,163
For six days,

714
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,860
the priest battled the demon
inside of me,

715
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,780
steadfast in his belief
that you can kill the evil spirit

716
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,167
and preserve the body.

717
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:12,921
Uh.

718
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,481
And how did he do?

719
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,564
I want to see the room.

720
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,165
Why are you putting that up there?

721
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,601
I don't want it to be in the way.

722
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,366
So,

723
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,927
what can you tell me about Angela?

724
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:43,845
Angela's

725
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,721
perfect.

726
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:51,721
I've never heard her say
an unkind word about anyone, ever.

727
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,401
Mmm.

728
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:00,122
You see, demons can be
very shrewd and calculating.

729
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:07,925
They hide in the image of their host.
They lie and deceive using the truth.

730
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,020
We need to know Angela

731
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,805
so that we know what she is not.

732
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,020
Can you please give us a moment
before we begin?

733
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,168
Perhaps you can go check on Angela.

734
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,725
Oh, yeah, sure.

735
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,580
Prepare the Eucharist.

736
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:41,060
If she accepts the Body of Christ,
a demon does not exist.

737
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,128
- But she's possessed.
- She is.

738
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,845
But we will see
what we are dealing with.

739
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,780
- Heavenly Father...
- No.

740
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,041
No?

741
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:57,380
Just prepare the Eucharist.

742
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:00,060
But the mass is essential
in preparing the Eucharist.

743
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,525
No mass.

744
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:06,980
Sometimes,
in search of what is an abomination,

745
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,809
we move away from God.

746
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:14,091
So do as I instruct tonight.
Trust what I do.

747
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,962
Because a demon's greatest threat
is not to your body,

748
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,804
but your soul.
