1
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:07,526
- He's looking better already.
- Maybe.

2
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,596
He still hasn't said a word.

3
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:12,798
It's going to take time.

4
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:16,602
They have the best doctors
in the world here.

5
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:18,504
It's gonna happen.

6
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:26,845
- Nervous?
- No.

7
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,617
Maybe. A little bit.

8
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:33,485
No.

9
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:37,322
- Are you turning soft on me?
- No, I can't. I'm on call.

10
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,324
I thought
this was a celebration.

11
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,793
It is... kinda.

12
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:44,296
<i>While waiting anxiously
for alterplex to launch</i>

13
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:47,766
<i>what the company claims to be the
final generation of energy solutions.</i>

14
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:49,801
<i>If you're joining us now,</i>

15
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:53,539
<i>we are less than a minute away
from entering a new future.</i>

16
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,246
This is really big for me.

17
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,350
I want it to be good
for you guys too, you know.

18
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,886
I know. And I'm proud of you.

19
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,724
I think.

20
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,736
<i>Alterplex gives the green light!</i>
Hey, Donny?

21
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:29,274
- Donny, come stand here.
<i>- T minus 50.</i>

22
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,781
<i>Ten, nine,</i>

23
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:39,284
<i>eight, seven, six...</i>

24
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,220
Thanks for being here.

25
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:42,721
Are you kidding?

26
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,489
<i>Three, two...</i>

27
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,467
Oh... it's okay.

28
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,579
What's it doing?

29
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,947
Ha.

30
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,783
It's working.

31
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,841
Okay. Okay.

32
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:53,412
Shit.

33
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:56,982
Ah, I'm exiting the lab.

34
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,895
Oh! Uh...

35
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:12,130
Unidentified male body.

36
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,607
Identified as Dr. klintsen.
Oh, god.

37
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,976
Shit...

38
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:31,216
This is will Porter, mission log one.
Uncertain as to my coordinates.

39
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:34,786
The jump was most likely
successful, but I can't confirm.

40
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:38,223
Personal bci non-responsive.
New bci procured,

41
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:41,460
but battery depleting.
Writing is... mirrored?

42
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:44,729
Either I'm in the echo
or I've sustained

43
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,865
serious cerebral damage
during jump.

44
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,104
Lab appears critically damaged.

45
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,940
Destruction appears recent.

46
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:57,809
Multiple deceased
scattered among the rubble,

47
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,212
including Dr. klintsen.

48
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:03,582
Heading outside to try
and confirm coordinates.

49
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,560
This is mission log two.
Outside of lab.

50
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,196
More deceased here.

51
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,199
Oh, god...

52
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,285
I have a visual on the tower.
Before executing the objectives,

53
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:43,688
I need to verify
if this is really the echo.

54
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,056
Shit!

55
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,238
Sorry, buddy.

56
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:15,887
- <i>Will?</i>
- Abby?

57
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,189
- <i>Oh, my god, will!</i>
- What... what happened?!

58
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:21,693
<i>We thought you were dead. Where are you?
We'll come and get you.</i>

59
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:24,062
Wait, Abby, I need to know
what happened.

60
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:27,566
<i>Where have you been? The lab was
attacked, will. The box was destroyed.</i>

61
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:30,035
<i>We moved to a camp
on the outside...</i>

62
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:32,971
wait. Back up.
What'd you say about the box?

63
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:36,207
- <i>I said they destroyed the box!</i>
- Destroyed? How? Who's they?!

64
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:39,711
<i>They shot the place up, will.
I... I saw it.</i>

65
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:42,047
Are you sure the box
was destroyed?

66
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:43,982
<i>I'm sending you our coordinates.</i>

67
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,759
What the fuck is going on?

68
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:09,774
<i>Alterplex cares.</i>

69
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,943
<i>We understand.</i>

70
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:15,146
<i>The future of mankind
is not out there.</i>

71
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:19,684
<i>It is in here.
And we have found a solution.</i>

72
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:26,791
<i>We have developed
a clean and simple way</i>

73
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,260
<i>of converting mass
into pure energy.</i>

74
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:31,096
<i>In just a few more months,</i>

75
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:33,331
<i>we will launch our energy tower,</i>

76
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,167
<i>powering our world
for millennia to come.</i>

77
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,805
<i>Alterplex energy.</i>

78
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,108
<i>Clean. Simple.</i>

79
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,043
<i>Safe.</i>

80
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,216
Mr. Porter.

81
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,290
Abigail vos,
chief of alterplex operations.

82
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,359
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

83
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:37,128
I believe you're familiar
with my partner.

84
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,431
Dr. klintsen.
This is a great honour, sir.

85
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:43,068
You know, I was researching at NASA when
you introduced duplicate matter theory.

86
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,705
That was the find of the decade.
You're a rock star down there.

87
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,840
We are very excited
you're here, will.

88
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:58,216
Mr. Reynard apologizes that he
couldn't be meeting you in person.

89
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,951
Sure.

90
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:01,720
Hi.

91
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:03,354
I have a lot of questions.

92
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:06,191
Your people were very good
at keeping me in the dark.

93
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:10,028
Well, these people
are in the dark too.

94
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,803
So...

95
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,073
a physicist who can fly.

96
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:26,911
It's no wonder NASA
poached you from the air force.

97
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,848
It's impressive. Uh, thank you.

98
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,251
Sorry, what is going on?
These NASA assessments claim

99
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,220
you have...

100
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:38,456
"Little to no risk aversion."

101
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:42,794
A similar view held by
your flight-school instructors.

102
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:44,529
Those assessments
are classified.

103
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:48,066
Wait. Is this... is this some
kind of a job interview?

104
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:50,668
'Cause, you know, I appreciate the
mystery flights and everything,

105
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,471
but I could've saved you
all a lot of time and trouble.

106
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:55,774
I am not interested. Thank you.

107
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:58,777
You haven't heard our offer.

108
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:01,246
Well...
I have a number of obligations

109
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:03,948
back in the United States.
Personal ones.

110
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,051
We are aware of your sister
and nephew.

111
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:09,320
And your new
surrogate-father role.

112
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:12,023
And the surrounding
circumstances.

113
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:18,429
It's very noble of you, will.

114
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:21,266
Mr. Reynard
respects your position,

115
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:24,135
which is why our generous
relocation package

116
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:26,404
includes all three of you.

117
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:29,974
Donny will have access
to a world-class private school.

118
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,844
It's a little more complicated
than that.

119
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:36,548
And the finest trauma
specialists in all of Europe.

120
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,421
With the compensation
we're prepared to offer,

121
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:45,990
your sister would never need
to work.

122
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,295
Will, this is not a job offer.

123
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:52,831
This is the...

124
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,533
Opportunity to explore...

125
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,971
impossible frontiers.

126
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,510
Well I've already been
to space, so...

127
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,246
Space is possible.

128
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:11,082
Then what are we talking about?

129
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:16,020
After that, I'm going
to need your signature.

130
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,882
<i>Hi! You've reached Mia
and Donny.</i>

131
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:47,218
<i>We're not here right now,
so please leave a message</i>

132
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,220
<i>after the...</i>

133
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,655
<i>Beep...!</i>

134
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:54,993
Mia, it's will.
Just call me when you get this.

135
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:58,229
This is will Porter.
Mission log three.

136
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:02,433
I can now confirm
that the jump was successful.

137
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,903
My location is the echo.

138
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:07,171
Unprecedented!

139
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,907
This is amazing.

140
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,387
Echo diagnostics
are still loading.

141
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,255
Currently at 57%.

142
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:27,992
Answer on gravitational
stability forthcoming.

143
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:36,668
Eight kilometres from the tower.
Eta just over an hour.

144
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,960
What...

145
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:04,362
The fuck is going on?

146
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:08,499
Oh, my god.
Must get out of here.

147
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,704
Okay, just get to the tower,
just get this done.

148
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:15,139
We can get outta here
and go home, okay?

149
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,674
Oh, crap.

150
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,679
Oh, my god.

151
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,749
What the hell's going on?

152
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:31,656
<i>There was...
There was a lot of shouting,</i>

153
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,624
<i>a lot of... lot of confusion.</i>

154
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:36,027
<i>And then
they just started shooting!</i>

155
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:38,763
<i>First, they were shooting and they
were going after alterplex guys,</i>

156
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:42,333
<i>but I saw a woman hit
just get out of her car</i>

157
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,536
<i>and I'm pretty sure they had
nothing to do with alterplex!</i>

158
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:48,773
<i>The leader of the militant environmental
group, calling themselves the rebels,</i>

159
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:51,109
<i>put out a statement today
justifying their assault</i>

160
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:53,177
<i>on the alterplex laboratory
and tower,</i>

161
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,546
<i>accusing the energy plant of
endangering the entire planet</i>

162
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,648
<i>by turning on its tower
a week ago,</i>

163
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:01,019
<i>citing the subsequent
destabilization of the system.</i>

164
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:03,087
<i>Meanwhile, alterplex,</i>

165
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:06,090
<i>which has been allowed to
deploy its own security drones</i>

166
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,359
<i>after issuing the controversial
alterplex security act,</i>

167
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,062
<i>made a joint announcement
with the police</i>

168
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:13,564
<i>that the evacuation zone
surrounding the tower</i>

169
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:16,034
<i>has been increased
to 75 kilometres.</i>

170
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,292
Oh, my god! What the...?

171
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,064
Mission log four.

172
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:50,401
Just had possible visual
on a gravitational anomaly.

173
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:53,071
The box is still loading.

174
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,475
Approaching anomaly.

175
00:17:57,477 --> 00:18:01,245
Definitely some sort of gravitational
portal at the base of the cloud line.

176
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:04,315
Seems to be active still.
Lots of static charge,

177
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:07,718
a tendril or a jet,
like a tornado but ionized.

178
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,189
Moving towards the anomaly now.

179
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,559
It looks like a small... boat?

180
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,327
Uh...

181
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:18,830
Numerous deceased birds...

182
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:21,632
Surrounding the anomaly.

183
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:31,542
Uh, the boat is mainly intact,

184
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:33,578
so maybe inverse gravity?

185
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,447
The portal
is still really active.

186
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,350
Seems to be sucking
the atmosphere.

187
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:41,119
Yikes!!

188
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:43,121
I ah!!

189
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,822
Oh, my...

190
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,828
Oh!

191
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,590
What are you doing?

192
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,789
Drone down! Drone down!

193
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,273
Everybody regroup! Come on!

194
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,441
- Who's that guy?
- What? Where?

195
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,277
Take him out now!

196
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,978
Wait! Wait! Wait!
It's alright, it's okay!

197
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,180
- Move away from the door!
- I'm trying to find a way...

198
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:24,915
and you! Hands high!
Hold your hands high!

199
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:27,018
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

200
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,687
- Hey, stop!
- Shoot him!

201
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,846
Stop! Stop it!

202
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:06,590
You're coming out.
I know you're there!

203
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,326
Give you three seconds!

204
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:23,441
Stop!

205
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,079
Michael?

206
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,851
- Will?
- Why are you shooting at me?!

207
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:10,988
You wanna put the gun down and tell
me what the fuck is going on?!

208
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,024
What the fuck are you doing with
these psychos?! You're alterplex!

209
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:15,926
You're alive. That...

210
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,863
Th-that's not possible.

211
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:20,498
Why not? Why not? What happened?

212
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,733
Michael, talk to me.
Tell me what you saw.

213
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,568
Tell me,
did something happen to me?

214
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,936
Michael?

215
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,673
What the hell
is happening here, man?

216
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:31,675
- Whoa-whoa-whoa...
- What the hell's happening?!

217
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:33,477
Put the gun down,
put the gun down!

218
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:36,046
I'll tell you what's happening,
but first you gotta answer me!

219
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:40,651
Bullshit. How did you survive?
How did you survive?

220
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,954
Shit!

221
00:23:56,435 --> 00:24:00,504
<i>Warning! Citizen, you are
trespassing in a restricted area.</i>

222
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:04,074
<i>You are violating

223
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:06,677
<i>Stop, or we will engage.</i>

224
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:13,784
<i>You are trespassing in a restricted area.
Stop, or we will shoot.</i>

225
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:16,787
I work for alterplex.
My name is will Porter.

226
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,789
<i>Remain where you are.</i>

227
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:21,091
<i>We have name listed as deceased.</i>

228
00:24:21,093 --> 00:24:24,128
<i>Take four steps forward

229
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,796
<i>arms and legs spread.</i>

230
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:28,098
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Let me prove it to you!

231
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,000
Let me prove it to you.

232
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,820
<i>Positive identification.
You are under arrest.</i>

233
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:52,623
<i>Remain where you are.
A transport is on its way.</i>

234
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:55,659
<i>It will escort you to alterplex
command in a few seconds.</i>

235
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:57,895
<i>Remain where you are.</i>

236
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,968
<i>Since the dawn of humankind,</i>

237
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:14,104
<i>we have reached for dreams
beyond our grasp.</i>

238
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:19,810
<i>We gazed at the birds
and built planes to fly.</i>

239
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:24,214
<i>We gazed at the moon
and built rockets to reach it.</i>

240
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:28,218
<i>Throughout history, we have transcended
our evolution with technology,</i>

241
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,789
<i>pushing through
to new frontiers.</i>

242
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:36,193
<i>Now alterplex's visionary ceo,
August Reynard,</i>

243
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:39,196
<i>asks you to gaze at the energy
challenge we face,</i>

244
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:42,733
<i>and, once again, push
through to a new frontier.</i>

245
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:46,604
<i>After decades of research,
we are proud to finally unveil</i>

246
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:48,872
<i>the future of energy harnessing</i>

247
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:52,676
<i>and realize our dream
for a better tomorrow,</i>

248
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:55,145
<i>powering us
for millennia to come.</i>

249
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:16,100
<i>This is a notification
for all alterplex personnel.</i>

250
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:19,303
<i>Reminder: Due to the increased
violent protests,</i>

251
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:23,107
<i>the emergency security policy
will now also include</i>

252
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:25,409
<i>sectors five, seven and ten.</i>

253
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:28,912
Yes. Uh, no.
We're not there yet.

254
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:32,816
We're still waiting on the...
Diagnostics report, yeah.

255
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:36,120
Well, I'll check on him.
I'll check him.

256
00:27:36,122 --> 00:27:38,188
Yeah. Okay.

257
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:46,263
So glad you're here, will.
Sorry. Launch logistics.

258
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:48,899
Clock is... ticking.

259
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:50,934
How are Mia and Donny adjusting?

260
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:55,673
Well... a little up and down,
to tell you the truth. Uh...

261
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:57,374
You know,
new city and everything.

262
00:27:57,376 --> 00:27:59,977
They have a lot of questions.
And frankly,

263
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:03,080
I still don't fully understand
what I'm doing here myself.

264
00:28:03,082 --> 00:28:06,150
Oh. Before we go any further...

265
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:08,419
This is for you.

266
00:28:08,421 --> 00:28:11,255
It's not a gift, I'm afraid.

267
00:28:11,257 --> 00:28:12,790
It's a locator.

268
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:15,392
Keep it on at all times.

269
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:18,696
Once we're live,
you're on call 24/7.

270
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,066
- 24/7?
- Exactly.

271
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:23,801
Shall we proceed?

272
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:25,169
Alright.

273
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:29,740
Ms. vos.
Beautiful day, isn't it?

274
00:28:29,742 --> 00:28:31,341
You must be will.

275
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:34,812
Michael. Welcome to alterplex.

276
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,887
Can't stay here.

277
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,824
We should keep moving.
Look at what they've done.

278
00:28:46,826 --> 00:28:49,026
And what about what you did,
Michael?

279
00:28:49,028 --> 00:28:51,729
- We raided the lab...
- What happened to you?

280
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:54,364
There's a lot of dead people.

281
00:28:54,366 --> 00:28:56,266
You can't be here.

282
00:28:57,202 --> 00:29:00,037
There's just no way...
Why is there no way?

283
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,939
You asked me how I survived,

284
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:04,374
you said it's not possible
I'm alive. Why?

285
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:06,810
I saw you die, will.

286
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,346
I saw you die.

287
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:12,249
Come on.

288
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:20,157
What is this?

289
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:54,391
What in hell
is really going on down here?

290
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:00,364
Run it, please.

291
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,969
<i>After the end of fossil fuels,</i>

292
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:09,106
<i>mankind is faced with
its greatest challenge yet.</i>

293
00:30:09,108 --> 00:30:13,410
<i>With the world's energy consumption
tripling in the last decade alone,</i>

294
00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:16,280
<i>a new form of sustainable
energy is needed.</i>

295
00:30:16,282 --> 00:30:19,950
<i>A system that outshines solar,
wind and even nuclear energy.</i>

296
00:30:19,952 --> 00:30:23,053
<i>After years of research,
we at alterplex</i>

297
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:24,988
<i>have found the answer
to the energy crisis</i>

298
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:29,059
<i>by leveraging the immense
hidden power of m-theory,</i>

299
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:31,995
<i>first proposed by
Edward witten in 1995,</i>

300
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,832
<i>and enhanced
by pieter klintsen's</i>

301
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:37,067
<i>duplicate-matter theory.</i>

302
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:40,470
<i>M-theory unifies all consistent
versions of superstring theory.</i>

303
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:42,906
<i>By deconstructing space-time</i>

304
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:45,175
<i>into a higher number
of dimensions,</i>

305
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:49,213
<i>our tower is able to create a
mirrored echo of our local universe.</i>

306
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:52,516
You're copying
the entire universe?

307
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:55,319
<i>Symmetry down to
every last quantum particle,</i>

308
00:30:55,321 --> 00:30:57,321
<i>with one crucial difference.</i>

309
00:30:57,323 --> 00:31:01,191
<i>The echo universe will be
devoid of organic compounds.</i>

310
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:04,061
<i>Instead,
it will be a lifeless cosmos</i>

311
00:31:04,063 --> 00:31:06,263
<i>providing a limitless amount
of matter</i>

312
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:08,498
<i>that can be transformed
into power.</i>

313
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,601
<i>Acting
as a dimensional conductor,</i>

314
00:31:10,603 --> 00:31:13,570
<i>the tower will create
multiple gravity portals,</i>

315
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:16,206
<i>which will harvest
the echo's mass</i>

316
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:19,343
<i>and convert it into
pure electromagnetic energy.</i>

317
00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:24,348
<i>This energy is then transferred
cleanly and safely into our world,</i>

318
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,117
<i>powering it
for millennia to come.</i>

319
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,459
I had the exact same face.

320
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,997
- Parallel universes?
- An echo universe.

321
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:44,434
And this here
is where you come in.

322
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:47,638
This is the gate.
It sends you into the echo,

323
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,940
a safe distance from the tower.

324
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:52,109
You will be carrying this box.

325
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,079
The box will counterbalance
any instabilities

326
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,282
that might occur in the echo.

327
00:31:58,284 --> 00:32:00,183
- Instabilities?
- Very simple.

328
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:04,554
It plugs
right into the echo tower.

329
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:07,391
Someone needs to get it there.

330
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:10,327
- Okay. May I?
- Yeah.

331
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,172
Just plug it in?

332
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,942
That's it?

333
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:27,277
That's it.

334
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,514
There's a terminal at the base
of the echo tower.

335
00:32:30,516 --> 00:32:33,483
You jump over,
take the box to the tower,

336
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:37,020
plug it in and jump back
in time for dinner.

337
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:51,468
Michael, nobody was supposed to
have been copied, no living thing.

338
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,972
This was supposed to be a sterile
world, devoid of carbon life.

339
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:56,606
I don't know what went wrong.

340
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:59,209
- So you're saying that...
- Hmm?

341
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,612
- They've copied the entire world?
- Well...

342
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:06,316
- the entire universe? - Kinda.
- How's that even possible, man?

343
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,986
You really don't wanna
get into that right now.

344
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:11,388
But ef-effectively, yes. Yes.

345
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:17,361
- So there's two of me.
- Possibly.

346
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:19,997
- Of everyone?
- Well... not everyone.

347
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:23,633
Not me anymore, I guess.
But I'm here to fix that.

348
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:26,470
I have to get this to the tower.

349
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:28,238
Uh...

350
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:33,643
"Redivider." What does it mean?

351
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:37,247
I don't know. They didn't
brief me on redivider.

352
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:40,584
What about shit like this, man?

353
00:33:40,586 --> 00:33:44,254
They never briefed you about trains
falling out of the fucking sky?

354
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:49,192
The system should've been one way,
harvesting energy from the echo,

355
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,528
from... this universe
into the real world.

356
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,364
But maybe the echo
is fighting back somehow?

357
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,033
It's sucking stuff back?

358
00:33:56,035 --> 00:33:58,035
Heavy objects
from the real world.

359
00:33:58,037 --> 00:34:01,038
I don't know, maybe it's
balancing out what's lost.

360
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,040
Jesus Christ.

361
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:05,509
No one's going to believe this.

362
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:08,512
Because no one is gonna know.

363
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:11,281
- What do you mean?
- Can you imagine the panic?

364
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:13,617
Look what's happening already.
People would freak out.

365
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:17,387
- We have to say something.
- No. We don't have to say shit.

366
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,688
Goddamn!

367
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,757
Look,
if you really wanna end this,

368
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:24,227
you have to help me
get the box to the tower.

369
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:25,662
Shit!

370
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,297
- Michael!
- Who's this?

371
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:30,400
Michael, put the gun down. Abby?

372
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,069
- What the...?
- Abby!

373
00:34:32,071 --> 00:34:35,138
Michael, easy. Easy.

374
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:39,076
This is crazy!
They destroyed the lab, will!

375
00:34:39,078 --> 00:34:42,712
- You destroyed the goddamn... - shut up!
- Shut the fuck up!

376
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:45,215
You cannot trust her, will.
Don't trust her.

377
00:34:45,217 --> 00:34:47,751
Reynard is waiting
with what's left of the team.

378
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:49,586
We're regrouping.
No. No.I can't-

379
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:51,721
- The plan failed, will. Badly.
- I know.

380
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:54,691
Come with me,
and we will fix this.

381
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:56,626
Abby. No, Abby. I can't.

382
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,368
- We gotta go.
- <i>You have been identified.</i>

383
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:09,106
<i>Lie on the ground and place
your hands over your head.</i>

384
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:11,274
Hey! It's me!

385
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:13,276
What the fuck
is wrong with you?!

386
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:14,811
I'll bring him in...

387
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,447
go! Go! Go! Run!

388
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,649
<i>We see you. Lie on the ground,</i>

389
00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:22,119
<i>and place your hands
over your head.</i>

390
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:24,187
<i>This is your last warning!</i>

391
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:30,460
Alright! No!

392
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:38,668
Let's go! Come on, get in!

393
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:44,374
Abby, let's go! Come on!

394
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:50,213
Ah! Drive! Come on!

395
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:53,383
Fuck you!

396
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:56,553
Fuck! Goddamn you!

397
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:01,858
He's coming in! Give me the gun!

398
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,794
Shoot!

399
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:06,696
Come on!

400
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,333
Shoot him!!

401
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:13,670
Argh! Goddammit!
You out?! Are you out?!

402
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:18,241
- It's out! It's out!
- My pack! Use the grenades!

403
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,712
Throw the grenade!
Throw the grenade!

404
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:31,855
Get to that bridge faster!
Faster!

405
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:13,330
Unmute.

406
00:37:13,332 --> 00:37:15,365
<i>The disappearance
is the latest in a line</i>

407
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:17,400
<i>of recent reports
of vehicles gone missing.</i>

408
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:19,636
<i>A bizarre pattern which seems
to be linked</i>

409
00:37:19,638 --> 00:37:21,805
<i>to abnormal weather behaviours
surrounding the sites,</i>

410
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:23,707
<i>according to some experts.</i>

411
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:25,842
<i>Some skeptics believe
the events are linked</i>

412
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:28,445
<i>to the alterplex energy tower
launched last week.</i>

413
00:37:28,447 --> 00:37:32,749
- He wanted to wait up for you.
- Yeah, I know. Sorry.

414
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:36,620
We'll get to it this weekend,
I promise.

415
00:37:36,622 --> 00:37:38,455
They're giving you
weekends off now?

416
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:39,956
Mm.

417
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:53,336
- And he gets a little homesick.
- Yeah?

418
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:56,773
Well... it'll get better.

419
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:06,883
And I swear I'm gonna do
something about all this...

420
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:08,685
Stuff.

421
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:11,821
Okay?

422
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,696
You should get out
and enjoy the city a bit.

423
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:23,300
Have you taken him
out on the canals yet?

424
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,002
We'll be fine, will.

425
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,340
Mm...

426
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,984
You okay?

427
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,627
- Bleeding. Shit.
- It's fine. It's fine.

428
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,798
You alright?

429
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,137
We have to bring you to Reynard.
He'll know what to do.

430
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:11,107
- Reynard and his team just tried to put
us in a coma! - Because you attacked us!

431
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,479
- Will?
- They were aiming at me, Abby.

432
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:23,052
Why? You're one of us!

433
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:25,054
Not anymore, Abby.

434
00:40:25,056 --> 00:40:27,490
Just get me into the tower.

435
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:32,762
The tower. What are you going to do
without the box?! They destroyed it!

436
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,964
Just trust me, I can fix this.

437
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,867
He can fix it.

438
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:42,672
But without Reynard
and alterplex. Without them!

439
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,775
We're getting in there, Abby.

440
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,510
I can end this.

441
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,913
Alright?

442
00:40:49,915 --> 00:40:51,848
He can end it.

443
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,084
Okay.

444
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:56,986
Will?

445
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:32,856
<i>Hi! You've reached Mia
and Donny.</i>

446
00:41:32,858 --> 00:41:36,125
<i>We're not here right now,
so please leave a message</i>

447
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:37,961
<i>after the...</i>

448
00:41:37,963 --> 00:41:40,930
<i>Beep...!</i>

449
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:42,966
Mia, it's me again.

450
00:41:42,968 --> 00:41:45,668
Please call me
as soon as you can. Okay?

451
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,036
I love you.

452
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:50,206
They evacuated.
I made sure of it myself.

453
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:58,581
Drone! Drone! Will!

454
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,120
Shhh.

455
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,232
We have to move
out of the open. Come.

456
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,099
Safe.

457
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:52,969
Let's go!

458
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:00,276
<i>We are not the military.</i>

459
00:43:00,278 --> 00:43:02,211
<i>We are an energy corporation.</i>

460
00:43:02,213 --> 00:43:04,747
<i>And the rebels?
They're anarchists.</i>

461
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:07,717
<i>That statement, given by
alterplex ceo August Reynard,</i>

462
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:10,319
<i>condemning the environmental group
which attacked the facility...</i>

463
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:12,889
If you find any water, take it.

464
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:15,592
<i>Which many officials viewed
as highly controversial.</i>

465
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:18,595
<i>News reports from the city
are hard to verify</i>

466
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:20,897
<i>due to the strictly enforced
exclusion zone.</i>

467
00:43:20,899 --> 00:43:25,201
<i>Vehicles seemingly appearing out of
thin air and dropping from the sky</i>

468
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:27,837
<i>sound like ideas
out of science fiction.</i>

469
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,340
<i>Yet many eyewitnesses have
reported these phenomena.</i>

470
00:43:30,342 --> 00:43:34,377
<i>The authorities are taking
these accounts very seriously,</i>

471
00:43:34,379 --> 00:43:36,679
<i>prompting
an official investigation...</i>

472
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:54,697
Jesus Christ...

473
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,336
Oh, my god.

474
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:10,713
Who moved these bodies here?

475
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,282
Oh, god...

476
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:15,985
Alterplex.

477
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:18,655
Alterplex security, for sure.

478
00:44:18,657 --> 00:44:20,289
I've seen similar sites.

479
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:23,693
First we thought
it was just a freak thing,

480
00:44:23,695 --> 00:44:26,129
but then they kept coming
and coming.

481
00:44:26,131 --> 00:44:30,133
After a while, just gave up. I
didn't even know about this one.

482
00:44:30,135 --> 00:44:33,369
Too many bodies.
That's when I quit.

483
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:36,372
I don't blame you.

484
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:42,211
On the other side...

485
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,683
is it like this?

486
00:44:46,685 --> 00:44:49,385
No, just these vehicles
went missing.

487
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:54,023
That's why alterplex sent me.
So it's not...

488
00:44:57,161 --> 00:44:58,861
I-I'm not...

489
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:02,098
Like I said, as far as I know,

490
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,167
the other you is alive.

491
00:45:04,169 --> 00:45:06,335
I...

492
00:45:06,337 --> 00:45:08,705
I don't know.

493
00:45:08,707 --> 00:45:10,473
Jeez.

494
00:45:10,475 --> 00:45:12,308
You okay?

495
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:19,048
Shit!

496
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,717
This way, this way!

497
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:22,185
We've got a drone!

498
00:45:22,187 --> 00:45:23,986
- It spotted us!
- Ah, shit!

499
00:45:23,988 --> 00:45:27,123
Let's get in the plane!
Let's go! Come on!

500
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:29,792
Let's go! Let's go!
Come on! Come on.

<i>Repeat, shoot to kill.

00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:28,184
Let's go!

508
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:43,032
You okay? Okay?

509
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,401
Goddamn.

510
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,038
Holy shit.

511
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:56,345
We have to go.

512
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,883
Go.

513
00:47:00,885 --> 00:47:02,285
Let's go.

514
00:47:02,287 --> 00:47:05,054
Move! They know where we are!

515
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,829
You okay?

516
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:15,164
We're clear!

517
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:16,999
Whew.

518
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:18,534
Goddammit.

519
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,839
Drone! Drone!

520
00:47:22,841 --> 00:47:26,843
<i>Face the drone and place
your weapon on the ground!</i>

521
00:47:26,845 --> 00:47:29,912
Help me out, will! Help me out!

522
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,250
Shit! I'm out.

523
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:42,124
Sight your rifle, will!
Fire the charge!

524
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,865
Look out!

525
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:50,399
Oh!

526
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:57,440
No!

527
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,531
What's it doing?

528
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:25,067
Ha.

529
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:26,602
It's working.

530
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:39,315
Hey, Donny, you see that?
See that beam of light?

531
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:43,386
That is pure energy that is being
sucked down into the tower.

532
00:48:43,388 --> 00:48:45,922
That's gonna power
the whole city here,

533
00:48:45,924 --> 00:48:47,924
maybe the whole country.

534
00:48:47,926 --> 00:48:50,393
- Sucking it from where?
- Well...

535
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:54,463
<i>Will Porter,
you are now on call.</i>

536
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:59,101
<i>The group's leader, Hugo romein,</i>

537
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,704
<i>in an interview this morning,
ensured that his movement</i>

538
00:49:01,706 --> 00:49:03,572
<i>will be monitoring
the situation closely.</i>

539
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:05,708
<i>Expressing grave concerns
about the tower initiation,</i>

540
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:08,277
<i>he went on to vow that his group</i>

541
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:11,113
<i>would take action
at the first sign of trouble,</i>

542
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:14,483
<i>although he did not say what
form that action would take.</i>

543
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,959
Will...

544
00:49:22,961 --> 00:49:25,328
stay with me.

545
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,132
Stay with me!

546
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:32,969
We gotta pull it out, okay?

547
00:49:32,971 --> 00:49:34,670
We got to pull it out.

548
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,709
There's blood everywhere.

549
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:44,680
Stop, stop! He'll bleed to
death if you pull it out.

550
00:49:47,452 --> 00:49:50,353
There's no way
he'll make it to the tower.

551
00:49:50,355 --> 00:49:52,555
We need to get him real help.

552
00:49:52,557 --> 00:49:55,624
Will, will, will, will.
Stay with me.

553
00:49:55,626 --> 00:49:57,626
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

554
00:49:57,628 --> 00:50:01,397
I know a place,
just a few blocks from here.

555
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,345
No, no, no.
It's me, it's Michael.

556
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:18,414
I got an injured man here.

557
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,716
Carry him.

558
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:24,420
You brought us here?

559
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,591
I had no choice, okay?

560
00:50:28,593 --> 00:50:30,793
He's bleeding to death.

561
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:34,196
Weapons down, please.

562
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:36,032
Weapons down. Come on!

563
00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:39,335
- Are you awake, will?
- Where's Hugo? - Will!

564
00:50:39,337 --> 00:50:41,203
Come on, all your weapons down.

565
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:42,571
Hey, Hugo!

566
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:47,410
That's not my problem.

567
00:50:47,412 --> 00:50:51,680
I'd tell you, but we need the medic before
he bleeds out. I'm telling you. Hugo!

568
00:50:51,682 --> 00:50:53,449
Stay here.

569
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:08,397
Come on, leave her alone.

570
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:11,400
- Don't you fucking touch me!
- Shut up.

571
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:13,135
She's unarmed.

572
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,611
Okay.

573
00:51:22,613 --> 00:51:24,480
Take 'em inside.

574
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:27,616
Clear the table, come on.

575
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,791
Sit down, will.

576
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:39,628
Look out for your leg. Whoop.

577
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,166
Please be careful with him.

578
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:50,339
Is the muscle damaged?

579
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:55,344
Give him a shot of propofol
and an iv of floxacillin.

580
00:51:55,346 --> 00:51:58,681
Okay, take his leg.
Okay now, got his leg? Alright.

581
00:51:58,683 --> 00:52:00,583
One, two...
- oh!

582
00:52:00,585 --> 00:52:03,119
Ooh. It's not working.

583
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:06,288
We need to apply side pressure.
Okay, try it again.

584
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,827
Pull! - Oh, it's out.
- Okay.

585
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,664
Try to relax, will.
Try to relax.

586
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:23,706
Hand me the scissors?
Trust me, he's gonna be okay.

587
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:27,376
I'll prepare the leg, make sure
he doesn't lose too much blood.

588
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:32,615
We have to prepare the leg.
On my count...

589
00:52:32,617 --> 00:52:34,917
Gauze. Nurse, gauze, please.

590
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:02,578
Couple of minutes,
you'll be as good as new.

591
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:27,736
<i>Who will stand up for her?</i>

592
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:33,909
<i>Who speaks for earth when multinationals
exploit her resources for profit?</i>

593
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:39,315
<i>Who speaks for our planet
when corporations rape her...</i>

594
00:53:39,317 --> 00:53:43,285
Mia? -<i> ...While pulling the
wool over everyone's eyes?!</i>

595
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,689
Mia, what are you
watching this for?

596
00:53:46,691 --> 00:53:48,691
<i>We speak for her...</i>

597
00:53:48,693 --> 00:53:51,227
- Hey, what's the matter?
- <i>In the name of justice!</i>

598
00:53:51,229 --> 00:53:53,829
<i>In the name of...</i>

599
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:57,299
nothing, I'm just...
I-I'm fine. I'm sorry.

600
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:07,843
Donny wrote this today.

601
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:16,318
The kids still teasing him
in school?

602
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,354
It's not the teasing, will.

603
00:54:18,356 --> 00:54:21,357
It's this whole place,
this... this situation...

604
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,559
These... things
that are happening.

605
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:32,601
You've been so good to us,
and you don't owe us anything...

606
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:35,671
Mia... - and I think
maybe it's time that...

607
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:38,607
No.

608
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:40,976
Come on.

609
00:54:40,978 --> 00:54:45,281
I don't want Donny and I to stand in the way
of something that's so important to you.

610
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:50,352
Mia, if he misses home,

611
00:54:50,354 --> 00:54:52,955
we'll go back on a trip.

612
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,864
Let me go talk to him, okay?

613
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:47,743
- Hey.
- Where am I?

614
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:51,080
How long have I been out?
Who are you?

615
00:55:51,082 --> 00:55:54,817
No, we have to... we have...
We don't have a lot of time.

616
00:55:54,819 --> 00:55:56,585
What...?

617
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,826
- Hey!
- Whoa! Easy!

618
00:56:03,828 --> 00:56:06,428
- Who are you?
- You have to let us go.

619
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:08,831
We need to get out of here
right now.

620
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:10,833
You work for alterplex,
just like her?

621
00:56:10,835 --> 00:56:14,536
- You need to let us go now.
- Tell him. Tell him.

622
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:16,105
Yeah, tell me.

623
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,709
Who do you work for?
What? Come on, Michael.

624
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:22,611
- Tell him.
- Michael?

625
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:26,548
Michael, come on. We need to
go, we need to get outta here.

626
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,083
Who is this guy?

627
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:35,591
What are you doing?!
No, no, no...

628
00:56:35,593 --> 00:56:37,893
Don't. What are you do...

629
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:40,863
Are you listening to me?!
We have to go!

630
00:56:40,865 --> 00:56:43,832
We have to get that thing
to the tower!

631
00:56:43,834 --> 00:56:45,868
- Redivider? What is this?
- That's impossible!

632
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:47,936
What is not possible?

633
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:51,874
What is this? Come on.

634
00:56:51,876 --> 00:56:55,744
You bring these people in here and
you can't explain what this is?!

635
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:58,881
- Hugo, he told me he can help.
- Did you sell us out, Mike?

636
00:56:58,883 --> 00:57:01,483
- No. I swear.
- Did you sell us out?!

637
00:57:01,485 --> 00:57:04,653
No, I didn't. Trust me,
I know what I'm doing.

638
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:10,426
- Hey! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- They can help. Hugo, trust me.

639
00:57:10,428 --> 00:57:14,897
They can help? Help bring us
this tracking device here?

640
00:57:14,899 --> 00:57:17,132
Help us all get killed?!

641
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:20,769
What is this?!!!

642
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:24,440
Shit!

643
00:57:24,442 --> 00:57:26,074
- Shit!
- Ah!!

644
00:57:26,076 --> 00:57:29,578
Where's the box?
Will, we need the box!

645
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:32,915
Michael, come on,
we gotta get outta here!

646
00:57:32,917 --> 00:57:36,084
Let's go, go, go, go!
Gotta move out!

647
00:57:36,086 --> 00:57:38,620
Move out, guys! Move!
Abby! Move!

648
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:41,723
Will, come on! This way!
It's the only way out!

649
00:57:41,725 --> 00:57:44,927
Michael, let's go,
let's get the fuck out of here.

650
00:57:44,929 --> 00:57:46,728
Let's get outta here.

651
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,532
Abby, come on!

652
00:57:53,937 --> 00:57:56,104
Let's go! Go! Go!

653
00:57:56,106 --> 00:57:58,474
Come on, move it!

654
00:57:58,476 --> 00:58:01,910
<i>Attention. You are harbouring
a wanted individual.</i>

655
00:58:01,912 --> 00:58:05,180
<i>You are in breach of the active
alterplex security order.</i>

656
00:58:09,953 --> 00:58:11,753
Shhh!

657
00:58:11,755 --> 00:58:14,189
Stay down, stay down. Okay.

658
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:17,893
Yeah, let's do it.

659
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:21,864
Go! Go! Go! Abby, come on!

660
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:30,906
Clear!

661
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:33,141
This way!

662
00:58:33,143 --> 00:58:34,843
Abby! Abby!

663
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:37,045
I couldn't tell you
about the box!

664
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:40,582
I know an escape tunnel nearby!

665
00:58:44,787 --> 00:58:46,855
Shit! Let's go! Come on!

666
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:55,564
- Give me the box, will.
- We gotta move! We gotta move! Come on!

667
00:58:55,566 --> 00:58:57,900
Why are you standing there?!
Come on! Come on!

668
00:58:57,902 --> 00:59:01,136
We gotta' go down.
Come on. Quick.

669
00:59:03,674 --> 00:59:05,874
Abby? Abby!

670
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:08,710
What was I supposed to do?

671
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:11,313
Abby, what was I supposed to do?
I couldn't tell you

672
00:59:11,315 --> 00:59:14,182
about the box once I knew
I was in the echo!

673
00:59:14,184 --> 00:59:16,952
You weren't even supposed
to be here!

674
00:59:16,954 --> 00:59:21,723
Nobody was supposed to be alive here.
Stop! No, you stop! Redivider...

675
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:23,258
What is redivider?

676
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:26,562
Huh? What is it?

677
00:59:26,564 --> 00:59:29,631
You sent me here.
You... sent me here.

678
00:59:29,633 --> 00:59:32,200
Now you tell me
what is redivider.

679
00:59:32,202 --> 00:59:34,202
It's a classified protocol.

680
00:59:34,204 --> 00:59:36,104
A last resort.

681
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:39,975
When restoring balance
is impossible...

682
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:45,113
the box disables one side
altogether.

683
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:48,283
It destroys the tower.

684
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:53,121
And this universe.

685
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:58,594
There's only one option left.

686
00:59:58,596 --> 01:00:01,697
Redivider aborts... one universe

687
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:05,667
to ensure... the other survives.

688
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,304
Jesus Christ.

689
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:13,308
This thing's
a goddamn kill switch.

690
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:42,337
Hey, bud.

691
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:15,737
I got your note.

692
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:22,210
I miss home, too.

693
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:31,920
Truth is, Donny...

694
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:37,225
I don't really know
where home is anymore.

695
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,929
<i>Will Porter,</i>

696
01:01:40,931 --> 01:01:43,965
<i>please call in
as soon as possible.</i>

697
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:57,345
You know, Donny,
there are a lot of...

698
01:01:57,347 --> 01:01:59,181
Very important...

699
01:01:59,183 --> 01:02:01,950
Very smart people
in these towers.

700
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:05,887
And they wanted uncle will...

701
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:08,824
To move
halfway across the world...

702
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:12,728
move our home
after it goes through...

703
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:15,964
To be part
of a very special project.

704
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:21,436
It's something that could help
a lot people, you know?

705
01:02:23,372 --> 01:02:25,440
Maybe even change the world.

706
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:33,181
I thought maybe I could help
you and... your mom too.

707
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:37,986
And that's a big responsibility.

708
01:02:41,224 --> 01:02:44,159
Maybe the biggest responsibility
of my life.

709
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:50,098
<i>Will Porter, please call in
as soon as possible.</i>

710
01:02:58,808 --> 01:03:00,408
What...?

711
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:05,313
Really?

712
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:11,319
This for me?

713
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:19,194
Thanks, man.

714
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:32,307
<i>So you sent me
on a suicide mission?</i>

715
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:34,976
I'm tired of being
fucked around, Abby!

716
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:36,511
I am done!

717
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:42,350
Where did my family go, huh?
Where are they, Abby?

718
01:03:43,286 --> 01:03:45,987
Will, where are you going?

719
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:48,957
Oh, shit! What's happening?!

720
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:58,834
Where are you going?

721
01:03:58,836 --> 01:04:00,869
You said they evacuated, right?

722
01:04:00,871 --> 01:04:02,904
Donny, my sister,
they evacuated?

723
01:04:02,906 --> 01:04:05,841
Will, this is a bad idea.

724
01:04:05,843 --> 01:04:08,543
- I am too close to home.
- No, you're not thinking clearly.

725
01:04:11,314 --> 01:04:13,248
This is a bad idea.

726
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,254
It's getting worse.

727
01:04:31,334 --> 01:04:34,102
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

728
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:39,040
It's... it's like it's coming
apart at the seams! What the...?!

729
01:04:45,348 --> 01:04:48,216
Holy shit! I gotta get to them!

730
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:49,951
Don't go!

731
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,529
Please stay with us.

732
01:05:01,531 --> 01:05:04,532
Get out of my way!

733
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,541
No! No! No! No! No! No!

734
01:05:13,543 --> 01:05:15,243
Oh, my god!

735
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:16,912
Mia?!

736
01:05:16,914 --> 01:05:19,381
Mia! Donny!

737
01:05:19,383 --> 01:05:22,050
<i>I should never have dragged
you guys here.</i>

738
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,620
I am done.

739
01:05:25,622 --> 01:05:27,522
- Done?
- Yeah.

740
01:05:27,524 --> 01:05:29,925
I've been so selfish.

741
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:49,377
- We're gonna get through this.
- I don't wanna just get through this, Mia.

742
01:05:52,581 --> 01:05:54,683
<i>You and Donny deserve
way better.</i>

743
01:05:54,685 --> 01:05:57,452
Please, I didn't mean for this
to become a big thing.

744
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:59,487
Mia, it's a huge deal.

745
01:06:00,423 --> 01:06:03,391
You're my sister.
I promised to look after you.

746
01:06:03,393 --> 01:06:07,429
And I... I don't feel like
I've done a very good job.

747
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:12,067
We're going home.

748
01:06:12,069 --> 01:06:13,668
All of us.

749
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:15,503
Are you sure?

750
01:06:15,505 --> 01:06:19,207
First thing in the morning,
I'm going to quit and...

751
01:06:19,209 --> 01:06:22,510
We'll get on the first plane
outta here. Okay?

752
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:32,387
Thank you.

753
01:06:52,641 --> 01:06:56,111
What kind of person are you?!
You said they evacuated.

754
01:06:56,113 --> 01:07:00,115
You said you made sure
of it yourself. You lied to me.

755
01:07:00,117 --> 01:07:03,251
What's that?

756
01:07:03,253 --> 01:07:04,786
What's it doing?

757
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,094
I'm sorry.

758
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:18,433
Wait here.

759
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:26,107
Shit!

760
01:07:37,686 --> 01:07:39,587
What the hell is going on?!

761
01:07:43,626 --> 01:07:46,361
Critical failure protocol!
You're going in!

762
01:07:46,363 --> 01:07:48,229
Will!

763
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:51,800
I guess that resignation
will have to wait. I'm sorry.

764
01:07:51,802 --> 01:07:55,537
- Where are they taking you?
- Porter! You have to go now!

765
01:07:55,539 --> 01:07:57,338
What?

766
01:07:58,574 --> 01:07:59,841
Will!

767
01:08:04,613 --> 01:08:06,481
Will!!

768
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:23,698
Traitor.

769
01:08:27,736 --> 01:08:29,437
We got Porter.

770
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,639
<i>What about the box? Is it safe?</i>

771
01:08:33,576 --> 01:08:35,343
Ah!

772
01:08:40,749 --> 01:08:44,319
- Yes, sir. - <i>Good, good. Don't
let it out of your sight.</i>

773
01:08:44,321 --> 01:08:46,287
What should I do with it?

774
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:49,190
- <i>Just like we discussed.</i>
- Copy.

775
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:38,706
Take them up front.

776
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:33,928
Reynard.

777
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:39,867
- Hello, will.
- Whatever he says, don't listen to him!

778
01:10:39,869 --> 01:10:42,403
- On your knees! Stay down!
- Don't trust him.

779
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:44,305
Jordan, let's go.

780
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:52,947
It's an interesting...

781
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:56,784
strange...

782
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:01,789
beautiful paradox.

783
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:06,394
Those two worlds conjoined,

784
01:11:06,396 --> 01:11:08,329
like twins...

785
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:11,499
just from the womb.

786
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:16,504
We have to sacrifice one...

787
01:11:16,506 --> 01:11:18,973
So the other may endure.

788
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:26,814
- You're going to sacrifice
the original universe. - Hmm.

789
01:11:26,816 --> 01:11:30,918
You're destroying my world
so you can live?

790
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,820
Fuck you.

791
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:37,859
We need your help, will.

792
01:11:37,861 --> 01:11:39,761
There is still time.

793
01:11:39,763 --> 01:11:43,765
Time for what?
You think I'd actually help you?

794
01:11:43,767 --> 01:11:46,467
With everything I know now?

795
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:50,638
I know...
This is a difficult decision.

796
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,640
Difficult? Difficult?!

797
01:11:52,642 --> 01:11:55,009
Killing my family is difficult?!

798
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:59,847
That's why going back
is the only solution.

799
01:12:00,783 --> 01:12:02,650
You can see them again.

800
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:05,787
You're the only one
who can pilot the jump.

801
01:12:05,789 --> 01:12:08,489
There is no third option.

802
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:11,826
If we remain here
in this stalemate,

803
01:12:11,828 --> 01:12:14,796
both worlds soon cease to exist.

804
01:12:14,798 --> 01:12:18,566
We have to sacrifice one
to save the other.

805
01:12:21,804 --> 01:12:25,540
Yes. Yes, Mr. Porter,
your family will die.

806
01:12:25,542 --> 01:12:29,744
I'm only offering you
the opportunity to be there.

807
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:32,780
Hold their hands...

808
01:12:32,782 --> 01:12:34,849
In the end.

809
01:12:54,371 --> 01:12:57,438
One must be sacrificed
so the other can live.

810
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:00,007
That works for me.

811
01:13:00,009 --> 01:13:02,543
Michael,
hold onto something now!

812
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:04,011
Ah! Ugh!

813
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:33,628
There.

814
01:15:44,172 --> 01:15:46,073
Where's Portman?

815
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,277
Where's Portman?!

816
01:15:51,179 --> 01:15:54,882
Where's the box?
Where is the box?!

817
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:57,785
Shoot me! Shoot me!

818
01:16:07,964 --> 01:16:09,730
Ah! Ah!

819
01:16:59,948 --> 01:17:02,783
Take this. We gotta move.

820
01:17:02,785 --> 01:17:04,919
You know what I need to do,
right?

821
01:17:04,921 --> 01:17:07,688
- Exactly what you gotta do.
- You know what this means?

822
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:09,156
Kill switch.

823
01:17:09,158 --> 01:17:12,960
That's okay. I need to right
some wrongs anyway.

824
01:17:45,293 --> 01:17:47,194
They're still shooting!

825
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:51,198
Drive! Drive!

826
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:54,268
Hold on!

827
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:03,010
- Michael!
- Shit.

828
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:05,680
- You okay?
- Oh, shit, I'm hit! I'm hit!

829
01:18:05,682 --> 01:18:07,381
Stop the car!

830
01:18:09,317 --> 01:18:11,752
Here, you take the wheel.

831
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,088
Let's go.

832
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:19,760
Let's go, move!

833
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:04,205
Will!

834
01:19:04,207 --> 01:19:06,273
Will, are you okay?!

835
01:19:09,211 --> 01:19:11,078
Will!

836
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:13,447
Shit! Shit, drones!

837
01:19:14,382 --> 01:19:16,150
Shoot!

838
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:29,897
Shoot the nose! Shoot the nose!

839
01:19:33,235 --> 01:19:35,936
Shoot the nose!
It controls the other drones!

840
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:37,371
Come on, will!

841
01:19:57,425 --> 01:19:59,193
Look.

842
01:19:59,195 --> 01:20:01,028
We're almost there.

843
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:33,360
Ah, shit!

844
01:20:34,296 --> 01:20:37,832
You get to the tower
and you end this!

845
01:20:37,834 --> 01:20:39,900
You end this, will!

846
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:25,479
<i>Truth is, Donny,
they wanted uncle will</i>

847
01:21:25,481 --> 01:21:28,649
<i>to be part
of a very special project.</i>

848
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:37,157
<i>It's something that could help
a lot of people, you know?</i>

849
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,227
<i>Maybe even change the world.</i>

850
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:48,469
<i>And I thought maybe I could
help you... and your mom, too.</i>

851
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:53,474
<i>That's a big responsibility.</i>

852
01:21:59,381 --> 01:22:02,349
<i>Maybe the biggest
responsibility of my life.</i>

853
01:22:02,351 --> 01:22:05,286
<i>I don't want Donny and I
to stand in the way</i>

854
01:22:05,288 --> 01:22:07,221
<i>of something
that's so important to you.</i>

855
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:12,159
<i>I've been so selfish.</i>

856
01:22:15,397 --> 01:22:17,998
<i>You've been so good to us,</i>

857
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,401
<i>and you don't owe us anything.</i>

858
01:22:20,403 --> 01:22:22,369
<i>And I think maybe it's time...</i>

859
01:22:23,571 --> 01:22:27,474
<i>If he misses home,
we'll go back on a trip.</i>

860
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:54,501
<i>You're my sister and I promised
to look after you. And I...</i>

861
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:58,505
<i>I don't feel like I've done
a very good job.</i>

862
01:23:04,112 --> 01:23:05,980
<i>We're going home.</i>

863
01:23:05,982 --> 01:23:07,648
<i>All of us.</i>

864
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:12,252
<i>I promise, I can fix this.</i>

865
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:52,359
I can't let you do it, will.
I'm sorry.

866
01:23:52,361 --> 01:23:54,728
I can't let you touch the box.

867
01:23:56,264 --> 01:23:58,565
This world is already dying.

868
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:03,270
This cannot be the end.

869
01:24:10,678 --> 01:24:13,047
Do you realize
what you're doing?

870
01:24:13,049 --> 01:24:16,116
Yes. I'm keeping a promise.

871
01:24:39,742 --> 01:24:42,476
Oh, shit! You've killed us!

872
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:45,479
You've killed us all!!

873
01:24:46,414 --> 01:24:47,781
