1
00:03:33,576 --> 00:03:35,043
When?

2
00:03:36,746 --> 00:03:38,008
Today.

3
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,512
Yeah, when today?

4
00:03:41,017 --> 00:03:43,577
Please. l'll tell him.

5
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:50,819
Hey, kids, how we doing?

6
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:54,295
We're good. Good.

7
00:03:56,065 --> 00:03:58,431
And l wasn't trying to surprise you.

8
00:03:59,368 --> 00:04:01,529
We weren't really surprised, sir.

9
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:08,943
Christian, do you think it's possible
for you to stop calling me ''sir''?

10
00:04:09,111 --> 00:04:11,102
l really feel old when you do that.

11
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:16,882
You know, l thought we had
an agreement here.

12
00:04:17,053 --> 00:04:19,749
Dad, we're just sitting. People sit.

13
00:04:19,922 --> 00:04:23,380
Look, honey, l'm not trying
to give you guys a hard time...

14
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:25,424
...but we have discussed this,
you know?

15
00:04:25,595 --> 00:04:28,120
Technically, you're under my roof still...

16
00:04:28,297 --> 00:04:31,198
...and l don't feel comfortable
with the two of you in here--

17
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:34,666
Stop. Have you seen
the size of this boat?

18
00:04:34,837 --> 00:04:37,067
Don't you think we could find
a zillion places...

19
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:39,571
...to do that thing you think we wanna do
if we wanted?

20
00:04:39,742 --> 00:04:41,175
Jennifer, l'm simply saying--

21
00:04:41,344 --> 00:04:46,646
No. l'm over your patronizing tone,
okay? l'm really over it.

22
00:04:54,523 --> 00:04:56,684
Hey, is she like this with you?

23
00:05:28,224 --> 00:05:30,158
-l'm sorry.
-No, excuse me.

24
00:05:30,326 --> 00:05:32,556
l'm trying to find the galley.

25
00:05:32,728 --> 00:05:34,696
l think it's off-limits to guests.

26
00:05:35,464 --> 00:05:37,557
Not so much of a rules person.

27
00:05:39,268 --> 00:05:43,136
-lt's quite a lobby, isn't it?
-Yeah.

28
00:05:43,305 --> 00:05:45,500
This the first time
you've been through here?

29
00:05:45,675 --> 00:05:47,643
So l guess you missed the tour,
then, huh?

30
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:53,575
But you had to come through here
when we boarded. Didn't you?

31
00:05:55,851 --> 00:06:00,686
Through that door is a service corridor.
Take a left, all the way to the end.

32
00:06:09,432 --> 00:06:10,990
Hi, it's me.

33
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:14,625
Could you call me? Please?

34
00:06:18,307 --> 00:06:21,640
l'm actually begging, aren't l?

35
00:06:22,845 --> 00:06:27,043
l'd like you to call me at midnight.

36
00:06:27,216 --> 00:06:30,049
You know, for old times' sake.

37
00:06:31,754 --> 00:06:33,415
Bye.

38
00:06:37,893 --> 00:06:40,384
Baby, baby, baby....

39
00:06:41,931 --> 00:06:45,628
Hey. You were supposed to
stay inside. That was the deal.

40
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:48,964
The TV isn't working. l'm cramped.
l'm going crazy in there.

41
00:06:49,138 --> 00:06:51,197
Come here, come here, come here.

42
00:06:51,707 --> 00:06:53,140
Coming through.

43
00:06:54,744 --> 00:06:56,609
lt's just, Elena...

44
00:06:56,779 --> 00:07:00,772
-...l could lose my job for this, you know?
-lt's not that l'm not grateful, Valentin.

45
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,316
l'm just.... l'm so bored.

46
00:07:04,854 --> 00:07:07,846
-You hungry? You must be hungry.
-l'm starving.

47
00:07:09,024 --> 00:07:10,889
Now, Elena, listen.

48
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,053
Look at me. Promise me
you will not come out again.

49
00:07:30,212 --> 00:07:33,409
The ocean has always been
the cradle of rebirth.

50
00:07:33,582 --> 00:07:36,073
Since man first emerged
from these salty depths...

51
00:07:36,252 --> 00:07:40,450
...we have looked to water as a chance
to begin anew.

52
00:07:40,623 --> 00:07:43,421
Poseidon was the god of the sea.

53
00:07:43,592 --> 00:07:48,256
He made his home on the ocean floor
in a palace of coral and gems.

54
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,456
And so, what better way to celebrate
the birth of a new year...

55
00:07:51,634 --> 00:07:54,068
...than borne on the back
of the old fellow himself?

56
00:07:54,236 --> 00:07:56,932
May you all have clear sailing
in the new year...

57
00:07:57,106 --> 00:07:59,040
...and all the years to come.

58
00:08:01,277 --> 00:08:06,715
Ladies and gentlemen,
the incomparable Gloria!

59
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,413
-Five thousand.
-Five thousand to call.

60
00:08:44,587 --> 00:08:46,316
Goddamn, boy.

61
00:08:46,488 --> 00:08:48,820
You got some mighty big ones on you.

62
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:54,694
-Hey, honey.
-Yes, sir.

63
00:08:54,864 --> 00:08:58,664
Get Lucky Larry another drink,
would you? Martini. Okay, babe?

64
00:08:59,168 --> 00:09:02,331
-There's blood in the water tonight.
-Five thousand to call, sir.

65
00:09:02,504 --> 00:09:06,440
You know, l think there's more money in
that pot than my old man made in a year.

66
00:09:07,276 --> 00:09:08,766
Five, and 1 0.

67
00:09:08,944 --> 00:09:10,935
Fifteen to call.

68
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,608
Happiest time of my life
is when l was broke.

69
00:09:15,217 --> 00:09:16,844
Make it 20.

70
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:20,614
Let's make it 20, and let's make it 40.

71
00:09:23,993 --> 00:09:26,223
You miss being mayor?

72
00:09:26,395 --> 00:09:27,589
Do you ever win?

73
00:09:29,832 --> 00:09:31,197
Forty more to you, sir.

74
00:09:32,034 --> 00:09:33,467
Goddamn, this is getting good.

75
00:09:33,636 --> 00:09:36,230
-Dad. We're going downstairs.
-Hello, sweetie. Have fun.

76
00:09:36,405 --> 00:09:37,872
-Hey, Jen.
-What?

77
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,974
Come on.

78
00:09:40,142 --> 00:09:41,871
l can see, you know.

79
00:09:42,845 --> 00:09:44,472
The twins? Dad.

80
00:09:44,647 --> 00:09:48,208
Can you just...?
One more button, please?

81
00:09:53,122 --> 00:09:54,419
Pair of fives, huh, Dad?

82
00:09:57,293 --> 00:09:58,726
Oh, God.

83
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,761
All in.

84
00:10:04,533 --> 00:10:05,966
l'll fold.

85
00:10:32,962 --> 00:10:35,590
-Oh, hey, kid, you all right?
-Yeah, l'm sorry.

86
00:10:36,966 --> 00:10:40,868
-How much for the game?
-l don't know, what's it worth to you?

87
00:10:41,036 --> 00:10:43,504
You were minding your own business
and those chips...

88
00:10:43,672 --> 00:10:46,869
-...jumped out in front of you.
-l wasn't watching where l was going.

89
00:10:47,042 --> 00:10:48,441
Come on, sweetheart, let's go.

90
00:10:49,778 --> 00:10:51,769
-Sorry about that.
-Not a problem.

91
00:10:51,947 --> 00:10:55,405
Guess what. Your friend the captain
wants you to blow the New Year's horn.

92
00:10:55,584 --> 00:10:57,142
No way! Mom?

93
00:10:57,319 --> 00:10:59,446
Go. Conor?

94
00:10:59,855 --> 00:11:01,846
Thanks, sorry, bye!

95
00:11:02,424 --> 00:11:05,757
-Great kid.
-Yeah, he is. Still amazes me, actually.

96
00:11:05,928 --> 00:11:09,364
So the captain's table? That's a nice place
to spend New Year's Eve.

97
00:11:09,531 --> 00:11:11,158
Does your husband--?

98
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,823
-That work much?
-What?

99
00:11:13,335 --> 00:11:16,793
The tentative mention of a husband
l'm supposed to correct...

100
00:11:16,972 --> 00:11:20,066
...even though you clocked
my wedding finger twice already?

101
00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:23,507
lt usually works better than that, yeah.

102
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:25,772
Normally what you get
on these cruise ships...

103
00:11:25,948 --> 00:11:30,510
...is your desperate single woman hoping to
meet a guy, and you sure don't fit the bill.

104
00:11:30,686 --> 00:11:33,814
That's not actually supposed to generate
a thank-you, was it?

105
00:11:37,192 --> 00:11:38,750
Maggie James.

106
00:11:38,927 --> 00:11:40,417
Dylan.

107
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:45,432
-What do you do, Mr. Dylan?
-First name.

108
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:47,796
Well, somebody's gonna
drink too much...

109
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,438
...and get into a fight
with their wife or husband...

110
00:11:50,606 --> 00:11:53,131
...and come up here and start buying
chips in a frenzy.

111
00:11:53,308 --> 00:11:55,469
Any night, but particularly tonight.

112
00:11:55,644 --> 00:11:58,374
And l take their money.
That's what l do.

113
00:11:58,547 --> 00:12:00,242
Professionally.

114
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:02,077
That supposed to be sexy?

115
00:12:02,985 --> 00:12:04,680
Depends. Was it?

116
00:12:06,188 --> 00:12:09,089
Nice to meet you, first name Dylan.

117
00:12:42,591 --> 00:12:45,185
Come on. That's right.

118
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:53,034
Decided, sir?

119
00:12:53,202 --> 00:12:58,265
We will have the Romanée-Conti,
1 988, please.

120
00:12:58,707 --> 00:13:00,197
Very well, sir.

121
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:03,902
-Nelson....
-My treat.

122
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,138
That's a five-thousand-dollar
bottle of wine.

123
00:13:06,482 --> 00:13:08,006
Carpe diem, my friend.

124
00:13:08,717 --> 00:13:10,844
Carpe diem.

125
00:13:13,489 --> 00:13:15,423
There was no work crisis.

126
00:13:16,158 --> 00:13:17,853
What do you mean?

127
00:13:18,527 --> 00:13:20,461
l'm sorry, l lied.

128
00:13:21,497 --> 00:13:23,294
Apparently...

129
00:13:23,465 --> 00:13:28,664
...the one who really missed
the boat in London was me.

130
00:13:30,005 --> 00:13:31,905
He's met someone.

131
00:13:32,808 --> 00:13:35,777
He didn't mean to hurt me.

132
00:13:35,944 --> 00:13:39,380
He never thought that this
would happen to him.

133
00:13:40,082 --> 00:13:44,178
l'm sure that you know this whole song,
so l don't have to sing it for you.

134
00:13:46,688 --> 00:13:48,986
l think l'll get some air.

135
00:13:49,158 --> 00:13:50,989
And then we'll have some wine.

136
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,860
Lots and lots of wine.

137
00:13:56,798 --> 00:13:58,925
Quiet. Quiet.

138
00:13:59,101 --> 00:14:01,194
Gentlemen, keep it down.

139
00:14:05,674 --> 00:14:07,369
Do you feel that?

140
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:12,471
Something's off.

141
00:14:12,648 --> 00:14:13,910
Here we go!

142
00:14:14,082 --> 00:14:18,041
Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!

143
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:23,157
Six! Five! Four! Three! Two! One!

144
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:25,156
Happy New Year!

145
00:14:25,327 --> 00:14:27,420
Happy New Year!

146
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:35,227
Happy New Year.

147
00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:49,274
Happy New Year!

148
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,960
You have no messages.

149
00:15:27,623 --> 00:15:29,284
No.

150
00:15:32,594 --> 00:15:33,959
No.

151
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:36,393
Hard to starboard!
Starboard engines, full astern!

152
00:15:36,565 --> 00:15:40,296
-Starboard engines, full astern!
-l got it, l got it! Come on.

153
00:15:40,469 --> 00:15:42,960
Turn. Turn!

154
00:16:04,726 --> 00:16:05,954
Turn!

155
00:16:06,128 --> 00:16:08,528
Come on. Come on, come on!

156
00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:21,438
-Bow thrusters!
-Full to starboard!

157
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,134
Sounding general alarm.

158
00:16:26,548 --> 00:16:29,847
All crew, report immediately
to your emergency stations.

159
00:16:30,018 --> 00:16:35,456
This is not a drill. All passengers,
brace for immediate and heavy rolls.

160
00:16:39,995 --> 00:16:42,361
Stay there. l'm coming, baby!

161
00:16:42,931 --> 00:16:44,956
Just stay there! Wait for me!

162
00:16:45,734 --> 00:16:50,228
Fire, life and safety crews, proceed to
your muster stations immediately.

163
00:16:50,405 --> 00:16:51,997
This is not a drill.

164
00:20:15,977 --> 00:20:17,274
Help me!

165
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:25,714
Stay calm!

166
00:20:28,056 --> 00:20:29,990
Conor?

167
00:20:34,462 --> 00:20:37,522
Oh, my God.

168
00:20:39,267 --> 00:20:40,427
Conor!

169
00:21:00,155 --> 00:21:01,588
Chris.

170
00:21:02,757 --> 00:21:04,384
Christian.

171
00:21:07,963 --> 00:21:09,590
Christian!

172
00:21:12,434 --> 00:21:14,026
Are you okay?

173
00:21:17,939 --> 00:21:19,201
Hey.

174
00:21:19,374 --> 00:21:20,671
My leg's pinned.

175
00:21:24,112 --> 00:21:25,238
Come on.

176
00:21:27,415 --> 00:21:30,077
Help. Somebody. Please, please.

177
00:21:30,251 --> 00:21:32,776
Please, help me.
l can't lift this by myself.

178
00:21:33,221 --> 00:21:35,849
-Please help me. Please.
-Okay.

179
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:38,553
On three.

180
00:21:38,727 --> 00:21:40,422
One, two, three.

181
00:21:41,863 --> 00:21:44,229
Again. One, two, three.

182
00:21:45,834 --> 00:21:47,062
Conor!

183
00:21:47,235 --> 00:21:49,430
Everyone, remain calm. Remain calm.

184
00:21:49,971 --> 00:21:53,270
Hey, lady. Up there.

185
00:21:55,176 --> 00:21:57,838
Hey! We need some help over here.

186
00:21:58,013 --> 00:22:00,345
Scootch back from the edge! Be careful!

187
00:22:01,082 --> 00:22:02,606
-Grab the side of that.
-Okay.

188
00:22:03,318 --> 00:22:06,378
-Conor!
-Come here. Grab the other side of that.

189
00:22:06,554 --> 00:22:07,612
You're okay!

190
00:22:07,789 --> 00:22:09,916
-His name Conor?
-Yeah.

191
00:22:10,091 --> 00:22:13,652
All right, Conor, l want you to jump
into this curtain.

192
00:22:13,828 --> 00:22:15,318
What are you doing?

193
00:22:15,497 --> 00:22:18,557
l used to be a fireman. We're gonna
get him down safe and sound.

194
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,501
You'll be all right, Conor. Come on, kid.

195
00:22:22,671 --> 00:22:25,435
Jump! Right now!

196
00:22:28,777 --> 00:22:30,301
Sweetie.

197
00:22:32,347 --> 00:22:34,212
Everything's okay.

198
00:23:11,052 --> 00:23:13,043
Move this thing.

199
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:18,115
We need something to leverage this.

200
00:23:18,293 --> 00:23:19,920
No.

201
00:23:21,796 --> 00:23:23,559
l'll go.

202
00:23:24,532 --> 00:23:26,432
lt's just dead people, right?

203
00:23:29,904 --> 00:23:31,428
-Baby, stay here.
-l'm here.

204
00:23:31,606 --> 00:23:33,403
-Stay with me.
-We're gonna be okay.

205
00:23:33,575 --> 00:23:37,739
Now, we're not sure exactly what
happened here, but our best guess...

206
00:23:37,912 --> 00:23:42,440
...is that we were struck by what is
known as a rogue wave.

207
00:23:42,617 --> 00:23:46,075
They're rare. They're unpredictable.
And they are lethal.

208
00:23:46,521 --> 00:23:48,284
Now the good news.

209
00:23:48,456 --> 00:23:51,186
The instant this ship was struck...

210
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:54,886
...emergency GPS locator beacons
were launched...

211
00:23:55,063 --> 00:23:58,931
...so we are, at most,
several hours from rescue.

212
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,000
-Are we sinking?
-How do we get out?

213
00:24:03,838 --> 00:24:06,398
Please. Do yourself a favor.

214
00:24:06,574 --> 00:24:09,839
Follow the directions of my officers
and stay calm.

215
00:24:10,011 --> 00:24:13,970
This room is a giant air bubble
holding up the ship.

216
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:16,811
Once these bulkhead doors
are sealed...

217
00:24:16,985 --> 00:24:20,477
...we'll be safe from gas leaks,
fire and flooding.

218
00:24:21,389 --> 00:24:24,222
We will be safe.

219
00:24:46,014 --> 00:24:47,709
What are you doing?

220
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:51,112
l'm getting out of here.

221
00:24:51,686 --> 00:24:53,551
Where are you going?

222
00:24:54,255 --> 00:24:57,554
l'm going up.
And out through the bottom.

223
00:24:57,725 --> 00:25:00,387
Wait. How are you gonna get out
of the bottom of the boat?

224
00:25:00,562 --> 00:25:03,030
That's the part that's all sealed up.

225
00:25:03,198 --> 00:25:04,392
She was in the nightclub.

226
00:25:04,566 --> 00:25:07,330
We have people there.
l'm confident they're dealing with it.

227
00:25:07,502 --> 00:25:11,495
You're confident? You can't reach them,
can you? l mean, what if they're dead?

228
00:25:11,673 --> 00:25:14,904
Then your daughter's dead too,
and leaving this room won't help.

229
00:25:15,076 --> 00:25:17,476
Half the people here have families
somewhere onboard.

230
00:25:17,645 --> 00:25:19,010
You know disaster scenarios.

231
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:22,445
These folks start climbing over each other
trying to search the ship...

232
00:25:22,617 --> 00:25:25,450
-...they're gonna get killed.
-How do l get up there, captain?

233
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,815
-l'm sorry, but you need to stay here.
-How--?

234
00:25:27,989 --> 00:25:31,390
-You may not leave this ballroom.
-Excuse me?

235
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,424
l'm within my authority
to compel you to stay.

236
00:25:34,596 --> 00:25:36,587
Captain, l understand
you have no choice.

237
00:25:36,764 --> 00:25:39,733
There's sick and injured people here.
You need to stay with them.

238
00:25:39,901 --> 00:25:41,630
But l am going to find my daughter...

239
00:25:41,803 --> 00:25:45,261
...and don't for one second
think you can stop me.

240
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,605
Dylan. What did you say to him?

241
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:54,976
Mom, there's holes at the bottom
of the ship with propellers in them.

242
00:25:55,149 --> 00:25:58,915
You can't get out that way, sweetie.
Please tell him you can't.

243
00:25:59,087 --> 00:26:00,850
Will you please take me and my mom?

244
00:26:01,389 --> 00:26:02,617
Oh, Jesus.

245
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:05,088
Tell him you can't. Please.

246
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,591
But l can.

247
00:26:06,761 --> 00:26:09,252
You think you can get us
off this boat safely?

248
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,261
What? Us? No.

249
00:26:11,633 --> 00:26:14,363
Hey. We're going out
through the bow thrusters.

250
00:26:14,535 --> 00:26:16,435
Captain's saying we should stay here.

251
00:26:16,604 --> 00:26:21,268
l wouldn't put a lot of faith in what
the captain has to say. l'm an architect.

252
00:26:21,442 --> 00:26:25,071
These ships weren't designed to stay
afloat upside down.

253
00:26:25,246 --> 00:26:26,304
You know this ship?

254
00:26:26,481 --> 00:26:28,449
-l know ships.
-Know where the disco is?

255
00:26:28,616 --> 00:26:30,413
lt's one story down, which is now up.

256
00:26:30,585 --> 00:26:33,383
-Suddenly in the mood to go dancing?
-My daughter's in there.

257
00:26:33,554 --> 00:26:35,351
Dylan, listen to me. Hey, Dylan, wait.

258
00:26:35,523 --> 00:26:37,855
Let's stick together here.
We'll get my daughter...

259
00:26:38,026 --> 00:26:41,826
-...then we help each other find a way out.
-Look, man, l work better on my own.

260
00:26:41,996 --> 00:26:43,725
-No offense.
-None taken.

261
00:26:43,898 --> 00:26:46,298
So where's the nearest vertical access?

262
00:26:46,701 --> 00:26:47,895
l'll know when l find it.

263
00:26:50,238 --> 00:26:52,103
-Hey, hey. You work here, right?
-Yeah.

264
00:26:52,273 --> 00:26:54,764
Where's the nearest vertical access?

265
00:26:54,943 --> 00:26:56,604
Service stairs, like, in the galley.

266
00:26:56,778 --> 00:26:59,975
Whatever you earn in a year, l'll double it
if you take us there now.

267
00:27:00,848 --> 00:27:02,611
Done.

268
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:05,412
You got a plan, and now we got a map.

269
00:27:06,421 --> 00:27:08,981
-lf you're coming, keep up.
-Let's go.

270
00:27:10,925 --> 00:27:13,359
Hey, Mom, are we going with them?

271
00:27:13,528 --> 00:27:15,189
Yeah, baby, let's go.

272
00:27:36,217 --> 00:27:37,582
Ramsey!

273
00:27:37,752 --> 00:27:40,721
You know we have to seal
the bulkhead doors.

274
00:27:41,923 --> 00:27:44,391
-Seal the doors.
-Yes, sir.

275
00:27:54,802 --> 00:27:56,633
Don't touch anything, sweetie.

276
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:11,710
l know it's been a while, God,
and l've been out of touch...

277
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,878
...but please, please, please
be with me.

278
00:28:16,057 --> 00:28:18,582
Be with me. Be with me.

279
00:28:35,276 --> 00:28:38,439
What the hell did you go and do
to all these people?

280
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:43,611
Cover your face, honey.

281
00:28:43,785 --> 00:28:46,379
-Those are the service stairs, right?
-Yeah, behind this.

282
00:28:46,554 --> 00:28:48,215
Damn it.

283
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:50,254
People, we got a problem.

284
00:28:52,493 --> 00:28:55,087
Hey. Hey, map. What's through here?

285
00:28:55,263 --> 00:28:58,096
Yeah. That's the--
That's the service elevator.

286
00:28:58,966 --> 00:29:01,196
We're gonna get through this.
Let's go.

287
00:29:02,603 --> 00:29:05,265
Find something we can pry it with.

288
00:29:28,629 --> 00:29:30,961
All right. What's through there?
ls there a way up?

289
00:29:31,132 --> 00:29:35,228
-More stairs.
-More stairs. Okay, let's find something.

290
00:29:43,544 --> 00:29:46,342
Careful. Careful. All right.

291
00:29:46,514 --> 00:29:48,607
-Okay, get the front up.
-l got it.

292
00:29:48,783 --> 00:29:50,842
Ready? One, two, three.

293
00:29:52,753 --> 00:29:54,516
-Shit. Pick it up.
-Hold it!

294
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,157
-Don't let it rock.
-Easy.

295
00:30:11,105 --> 00:30:12,766
l can't get leverage.

296
00:30:14,242 --> 00:30:16,437
Hey, what if we go through up there?

297
00:30:16,611 --> 00:30:18,340
The entertainment section's up there.

298
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,849
-Come give me a hand.
-We'll hold it steady. You'll be all right.

299
00:30:22,016 --> 00:30:23,347
lt's okay. Come on.

300
00:30:23,518 --> 00:30:25,509
-Go.
-Come on.

301
00:30:27,455 --> 00:30:31,289
Okay. Now put your back up
against this wall. Come on.

302
00:30:37,365 --> 00:30:40,061
-Good.
-Hurry, hurry!

303
00:30:40,234 --> 00:30:42,202
-Now give me a stirrup.
-Okay, okay.

304
00:30:46,974 --> 00:30:48,874
Go up.

305
00:30:58,653 --> 00:31:00,416
lt's okay! Honey.

306
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,724
Okay. Send the kid. Come on.

307
00:31:05,893 --> 00:31:07,383
Don't look down.

308
00:31:08,796 --> 00:31:11,924
-Come on. All right.
-That's it. Don't look down, honey.

309
00:31:15,002 --> 00:31:16,936
-lt's okay.
-lt's okay, son.

310
00:31:17,405 --> 00:31:19,839
-That's it, that's it. Look, look.
-That's good.

311
00:31:20,007 --> 00:31:21,599
That's it!

312
00:31:21,776 --> 00:31:23,334
Excellent. Put your hands up.

313
00:31:23,511 --> 00:31:25,308
Reach your hands up to me.

314
00:31:25,613 --> 00:31:27,103
Up!

315
00:31:28,683 --> 00:31:29,911
Gotcha.

316
00:31:30,818 --> 00:31:33,343
-Good boy!
-Okay. Come on, Maggie.

317
00:31:35,223 --> 00:31:36,690
Come on. Keep coming.

318
00:31:37,225 --> 00:31:38,783
Good.

319
00:31:39,393 --> 00:31:42,658
Okay, up. One, two, three.

320
00:31:45,099 --> 00:31:47,966
Okay. l got this.

321
00:32:00,514 --> 00:32:01,606
Damn it.

322
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:04,445
Hold on, hold on!

323
00:32:07,788 --> 00:32:10,222
-Thank you, gorgeous.
-My name's Valentin.

324
00:32:10,958 --> 00:32:14,223
Valentin. l love that name.

325
00:32:17,465 --> 00:32:18,727
You-- You go first.

326
00:32:18,899 --> 00:32:20,958
-Come on.
-You go first!

327
00:32:23,904 --> 00:32:27,271
-Come on, give me your hand.
-Give me your foot. Give me your foot.

328
00:32:28,976 --> 00:32:30,534
l gotcha.

329
00:32:34,649 --> 00:32:35,809
Hang on!

330
00:32:44,058 --> 00:32:45,616
He's gonna take them both down.

331
00:32:45,793 --> 00:32:48,421
-Stay back, sweetie.
-l'm gonna anchor us. Hold onto him!

332
00:32:48,596 --> 00:32:49,893
Help me up!

333
00:32:50,831 --> 00:32:53,823
-lt's okay.
-Come on!

334
00:32:58,339 --> 00:32:59,499
Help me up!

335
00:32:59,674 --> 00:33:01,608
Give me one of my hands.

336
00:33:04,979 --> 00:33:06,378
l'm losing him.

337
00:33:14,488 --> 00:33:16,615
Shake him off.

338
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:18,053
Shake him off!

339
00:33:18,225 --> 00:33:20,853
-Now, or you both die!
-No!

340
00:33:21,028 --> 00:33:22,757
l'm so sorry.

341
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:26,366
Shake him off! Now!

342
00:33:27,501 --> 00:33:30,732
No! No! No!

343
00:33:42,917 --> 00:33:44,350
Come on!

344
00:33:50,491 --> 00:33:52,823
-Captain.
-That felt like the galley.

345
00:33:52,993 --> 00:33:54,722
Gas shutoffs must have malfunctioned.

346
00:33:54,895 --> 00:33:56,920
The door seals,
will they keep the fire out?

347
00:33:57,098 --> 00:34:00,397
-Yes, captain.
-Help! Somebody, over here.

348
00:34:01,435 --> 00:34:03,562
God rest their souls.

349
00:34:25,926 --> 00:34:27,518
l'll take a look.

350
00:34:52,887 --> 00:34:55,219
Come on, l think l found a way.

351
00:35:01,395 --> 00:35:03,329
Come on.

352
00:35:12,673 --> 00:35:14,265
Maybe you could move your leg.

353
00:35:14,442 --> 00:35:15,909
-l-- Nothing.
-Try pulling it up.

354
00:35:16,076 --> 00:35:20,638
Two girls squawking at you,
and nowhere to run. You are in hell, boy.

355
00:35:21,182 --> 00:35:23,582
Any of you skirts ever changed
a goddamn tire?

356
00:35:23,751 --> 00:35:25,013
Enlighten us, cowboy.

357
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,710
Feisty.

358
00:35:27,888 --> 00:35:32,416
Never really works to pull when all you
really needed was some good pushing.

359
00:35:34,295 --> 00:35:36,593
-Know what l mean?
-Hurry up and lift the thing!

360
00:35:36,764 --> 00:35:38,425
All right, grab hold.

361
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:42,435
Three, two, one. Push!

362
00:35:43,938 --> 00:35:45,530
Come on!

363
00:35:45,706 --> 00:35:49,870
All right. Hold on, hold on, hold on.
We got ourselves a situation.

364
00:35:50,044 --> 00:35:52,035
-We can do this.
-Come on!

365
00:35:53,514 --> 00:35:56,950
Three, two, one, push!

366
00:36:04,658 --> 00:36:06,125
Happy New Year.

367
00:36:06,861 --> 00:36:08,920
Happy goddamn New Year.

368
00:36:18,672 --> 00:36:20,162
What?

369
00:36:22,776 --> 00:36:24,004
Daddy?

370
00:36:28,716 --> 00:36:31,207
lt's all right, baby. lt's all right.

371
00:36:44,798 --> 00:36:47,358
All right, all right.
There you go.

372
00:36:47,535 --> 00:36:49,867
Give me your water and your hankie,
sweetie.

373
00:36:51,505 --> 00:36:55,066
l think it's just a cut, but l wanna
clean it anyway, okay?

374
00:36:55,242 --> 00:36:57,437
l'm gonna look for a way out of here.

375
00:37:00,581 --> 00:37:02,105
-Chris.
-Yeah?

376
00:37:02,983 --> 00:37:06,009
Thank you very much.

377
00:37:07,988 --> 00:37:11,446
Sir, l didn't.... l mean, she saved me.

378
00:37:14,995 --> 00:37:16,929
Are you okay?

379
00:37:19,633 --> 00:37:21,567
Just a bad headache.

380
00:37:22,269 --> 00:37:24,464
Here, finish this.

381
00:37:25,506 --> 00:37:28,498
One thing we have a lot of around here
is water.

382
00:37:29,476 --> 00:37:32,411
My name is Nelson.

383
00:37:34,682 --> 00:37:37,480
Elena. How bad is it?

384
00:37:37,651 --> 00:37:39,448
lt's very bad.

385
00:37:41,155 --> 00:37:42,816
Were you with someone?

386
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,821
Yeah.

387
00:37:46,493 --> 00:37:47,983
Not really.

388
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:52,055
My brother's in the hospital.

389
00:37:53,634 --> 00:37:56,831
l didn't have any money
to get to New York...

390
00:37:57,004 --> 00:38:01,065
...so l meet this guy at a club,
he works on a ship.

391
00:38:01,241 --> 00:38:05,644
He says l can bunk with him,
you know, for passage.

392
00:38:07,314 --> 00:38:08,804
He was pretty nice.

393
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:19,725
What are you doing?

394
00:38:20,227 --> 00:38:21,626
Thinking.

395
00:38:22,363 --> 00:38:25,560
-You?
-Thinking.

396
00:38:26,433 --> 00:38:28,492
What are we thinking about, exactly?

397
00:38:28,836 --> 00:38:31,532
Well, l figure this door is the way up.

398
00:38:31,705 --> 00:38:34,606
l'm thinking, ''What's behind it?''

399
00:38:36,176 --> 00:38:38,576
Hey. Easy there, fireball.

400
00:38:39,647 --> 00:38:41,308
Watch.

401
00:38:45,085 --> 00:38:48,213
Conor! Hey, Conor, what are you doing?

402
00:38:48,389 --> 00:38:50,448
Hey, Mom, this door is the way up.

403
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:53,422
Don't walk off from me like that, okay?

404
00:38:53,861 --> 00:38:56,523
-Hey, it's the other guy.
-Hey.

405
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:00,359
Yeah, Robert, that door is extremely
hot, but it's our only choice.

406
00:39:00,534 --> 00:39:03,503
-Here. What do you think?
-Let's give it a shot.

407
00:39:03,671 --> 00:39:07,664
l'm hoping it was a flash fire, but this
whole area could be superheated still, right?

408
00:39:07,841 --> 00:39:10,810
-You tour on a sub?
-l wouldn't call it touring.

409
00:39:10,978 --> 00:39:12,707
Go.

410
00:39:17,484 --> 00:39:19,577
-Flash fire.
-Good call.

411
00:39:19,753 --> 00:39:21,277
lt's all right.

412
00:39:21,455 --> 00:39:24,049
-So how long were you in the Navy?
-Too long.

413
00:39:24,224 --> 00:39:27,022
l feel like l know your dad.

414
00:39:28,328 --> 00:39:32,264
He was mayor of New York for a while.
When l was a kid.

415
00:39:32,433 --> 00:39:34,162
Cool.

416
00:39:36,036 --> 00:39:37,628
lt wasn't.

417
00:39:57,858 --> 00:39:59,382
Another way up, anybody?

418
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,586
l've been sneaking around
this ship for days. This is it.

419
00:40:02,763 --> 00:40:05,061
-All right, then we climb.
-ls it gonna hold?

420
00:40:05,232 --> 00:40:06,859
lt's possible. lt is steel.

421
00:40:07,034 --> 00:40:09,093
Look at the monkey boy.

422
00:40:09,269 --> 00:40:12,170
Chris, what are you doing? Come back.

423
00:40:16,543 --> 00:40:18,670
l think it'll hold.

424
00:40:27,121 --> 00:40:29,055
Go easy.

425
00:40:34,728 --> 00:40:36,662
Elena.

426
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,695
You're halfway there, come on.

427
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,794
Chris, wait. Come back and get Conor.

428
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:45,905
Conor, put your foot right where my foot is
and go to Robert.

429
00:40:46,073 --> 00:40:48,234
There you go. Put your hand right there.

430
00:40:48,408 --> 00:40:50,467
Okay, hang on. l'll grab him.

431
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,575
Great.

432
00:40:56,183 --> 00:40:59,118
You might wanna take it easy on that.

433
00:41:01,288 --> 00:41:02,812
-You got him, Chris?
-l got him.

434
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:05,788
Excellent, excellent, excellent, yes.

435
00:41:08,695 --> 00:41:12,597
-You got her?
-Okay. Here you go.

436
00:41:15,936 --> 00:41:19,804
-Okay, baby, it's your turn.
-Hell, no. Lucky Larry's ready to go.

437
00:41:19,973 --> 00:41:21,338
What?

438
00:41:21,542 --> 00:41:24,375
Oh, yeah. Right, sorry.

439
00:41:24,545 --> 00:41:27,708
You know, l forgot. Big hero.

440
00:41:27,881 --> 00:41:31,544
Rescued all those women and children
from the fires.

441
00:41:31,718 --> 00:41:35,745
Got elected. Man of the people.

442
00:41:35,923 --> 00:41:38,517
But you're not the boss anymore.

443
00:41:38,692 --> 00:41:40,523
You quit, couldn't hack it.

444
00:41:41,195 --> 00:41:44,494
lf l recall correctly, you couldn't even
hang onto your wife.

445
00:41:46,733 --> 00:41:48,894
Come on. Come on.

446
00:41:49,069 --> 00:41:52,004
Dad. Dad, let it go, okay? Please.

447
00:41:52,172 --> 00:41:55,005
''Daddy, please.'' Come on.

448
00:41:58,111 --> 00:42:02,639
Hey, man. Hey, you got it.
Knock yourself out.

449
00:42:02,816 --> 00:42:04,716
-lt's okay.
-Go ahead.

450
00:42:04,885 --> 00:42:06,785
Assholes, both of you.

451
00:42:06,954 --> 00:42:09,081
You're right. lt's okay.

452
00:42:12,025 --> 00:42:15,256
l'm not gonna let you bring me down
with you, not by a short hair.

453
00:42:15,662 --> 00:42:19,154
You don't just get the nickname
Lucky Larry.

454
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:21,665
You gotta be lucky.

455
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:31,843
No!

456
00:42:32,012 --> 00:42:33,502
Damn it.

457
00:42:35,582 --> 00:42:37,174
Hey, who's shooting at us?

458
00:42:51,465 --> 00:42:53,399
Jen! Jen!

459
00:42:57,404 --> 00:42:59,235
Get back, get back!

460
00:43:07,281 --> 00:43:11,274
So we gotta go back down one level
and we find another way up.

461
00:43:11,451 --> 00:43:14,443
Go back down? We just came
through there. There is no other way.

462
00:43:14,621 --> 00:43:15,815
You go that way, you die.

463
00:43:15,989 --> 00:43:17,923
We didn't look through every corridor.

464
00:43:18,091 --> 00:43:20,082
You do what you want.
l'm getting across.

465
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,091
lf you got a better idea,
l'm all ears--

466
00:43:22,262 --> 00:43:25,129
No, Robert, l don't got another way,
but l'm getting across!

467
00:43:25,299 --> 00:43:27,927
You get stuck here, you'll die!
We're going. Let's go.

468
00:43:28,101 --> 00:43:30,569
-Daddy, l can't. l'm sorry.
-What?

469
00:43:30,737 --> 00:43:34,104
-Dylan, can you get me across?
-Jen, baby girl, listen--

470
00:43:34,274 --> 00:43:37,732
No! l haven't been in
a long time, Dad.

471
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,852
Chris asked me to marry him.

472
00:43:51,024 --> 00:43:55,017
l love him. l need to find a way
to go with him.

473
00:43:55,195 --> 00:43:58,528
-No, you need to listen to me for a second.
-l'm not going back, Dad.

474
00:43:58,699 --> 00:44:02,533
l hate to break up the family therapy,
but you still looking for a way across?

475
00:44:02,703 --> 00:44:04,068
Yes.

476
00:44:35,969 --> 00:44:38,563
Do you see him? Where is he?

477
00:44:40,607 --> 00:44:42,598
Hey, did you miss me?

478
00:44:44,544 --> 00:44:45,977
Son of a bitch.

479
00:44:52,052 --> 00:44:54,816
-What do you need?
-All right. Take the slack.

480
00:45:01,261 --> 00:45:02,489
Got it?

481
00:45:05,365 --> 00:45:07,526
Hey, Ramsey! Ramsey!

482
00:45:08,468 --> 00:45:09,935
Come on.

483
00:45:10,103 --> 00:45:12,128
l did the hard part.

484
00:45:17,244 --> 00:45:20,702
You couldn't even find your way home
from school. We lived two blocks away.

485
00:45:21,148 --> 00:45:24,709
-l remember, Dad.
-Hey, Ramsey, come on!

486
00:45:30,424 --> 00:45:31,789
Daddy?

487
00:45:34,261 --> 00:45:37,196
Come on, Jen, you'll be fine. Come on!

488
00:45:37,364 --> 00:45:39,127
Jenny!

489
00:45:41,301 --> 00:45:44,099
Now, what kind of kid
can't find her way home?

490
00:45:44,271 --> 00:45:45,795
l was 7, by the way.

491
00:45:45,972 --> 00:45:48,941
So, what do you think?
You too big for a piggyback ride?

492
00:45:49,109 --> 00:45:52,567
-Not today.
-All right.

493
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,205
All right, baby. Hold on.

494
00:45:56,383 --> 00:45:58,874
Here we go. Hang on, baby!

495
00:46:02,255 --> 00:46:03,813
l gotcha.

496
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:05,548
They're okay.

497
00:46:09,496 --> 00:46:11,964
-You wanna hit me?
-Actually...

498
00:46:12,199 --> 00:46:15,691
...you're doing pretty good. So far.

499
00:46:15,869 --> 00:46:17,268
Can we keep going here?

500
00:46:17,437 --> 00:46:19,997
Yeah, let's go.
This way's the best way up.

501
00:47:13,426 --> 00:47:14,916
Hurry.

502
00:47:49,529 --> 00:47:50,518
You're okay.

503
00:48:00,523 --> 00:48:02,184
Let's go.

504
00:48:20,042 --> 00:48:21,270
Come on!

505
00:48:21,444 --> 00:48:24,470
Come on, let's go.
Look for a way up, everybody.

506
00:48:27,783 --> 00:48:30,445
-l got an access hatch here!
-Over here!

507
00:48:36,459 --> 00:48:39,553
Dylan, we got water coming in
over here!

508
00:48:49,805 --> 00:48:51,636
Back up!

509
00:48:52,508 --> 00:48:57,036
-Get back!
-Wait a minute. l got something here!

510
00:48:58,981 --> 00:49:00,573
All right, get that corner.

511
00:49:03,486 --> 00:49:06,421
We can't all fit in there.
We don't even know where it goes.

512
00:49:06,589 --> 00:49:09,820
lf we stay here, we drown. Let's go!
We gotta keep moving up.

513
00:49:09,992 --> 00:49:11,323
Oh, my God!

514
00:49:12,662 --> 00:49:15,893
All right. l got a vertical shaft
up ahead about 1 0 yards.

515
00:49:16,065 --> 00:49:18,090
Looks like it leads to the upper levels.

516
00:49:18,267 --> 00:49:20,235
-Chris?
-Might as well give him a chance...

517
00:49:20,403 --> 00:49:22,598
-...to kick me in the head.
-Come on, Chris!

518
00:49:39,822 --> 00:49:42,655
We're good. The shaft leads up.

519
00:49:43,292 --> 00:49:46,728
-Are you okay, sweetheart?
-l think so.

520
00:49:46,896 --> 00:49:48,329
Just keep on moving.

521
00:50:07,283 --> 00:50:10,309
God. How the hell
did you fit through here?

522
00:50:14,356 --> 00:50:17,621
Mom, don't look down, okay?

523
00:50:19,061 --> 00:50:20,892
-Okay, Nelson, you're next.
-Okay.

524
00:50:21,063 --> 00:50:23,827
-l'll be the last one. You go.
-Elena, just get in the vent.

525
00:50:23,999 --> 00:50:26,092
-l'll wait here a little longer.
-You're fine.

526
00:50:26,268 --> 00:50:29,362
-l can't go in there. l'm sorry, l can't!
-Elena, get in the vent.

527
00:50:29,538 --> 00:50:31,529
The water's rising.
Elena, get in the vent!

528
00:50:31,707 --> 00:50:35,700
-Elena, if you don't go, we don't go.
-What? What?

529
00:50:35,878 --> 00:50:37,106
No! No!

530
00:50:37,279 --> 00:50:39,975
Go on, go! Grab her, grab her!
You got her?

531
00:50:40,616 --> 00:50:44,108
lt seems congratulations are in order,
Chris.

532
00:50:44,286 --> 00:50:45,685
Thank you, sir.

533
00:50:46,021 --> 00:50:47,921
l'm glad she finally told you.

534
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:51,685
Well, tradition might have had you
coming to me first.

535
00:50:51,861 --> 00:50:53,328
Yeah, l realize that.

536
00:50:53,496 --> 00:50:57,455
And l wanted to, l really did, but she
made me promise not to say anything.

537
00:50:57,633 --> 00:50:59,760
She's really careful
when it comes to you, sir.

538
00:50:59,935 --> 00:51:03,598
-Let me out! Let me out!
-Come on, Elena.

539
00:51:03,773 --> 00:51:06,435
-You're doing great. Come on.
-Elena, take my foot!

540
00:51:06,609 --> 00:51:10,170
Grab my ankle.
That's it. That's it. That's it.

541
00:51:13,582 --> 00:51:16,244
-You can do it. That's it, just hold on.
-l can't breathe.

542
00:51:21,957 --> 00:51:23,447
No.

543
00:51:32,868 --> 00:51:34,529
Elena?

544
00:51:34,703 --> 00:51:36,568
We're gonna go up now.

545
00:52:00,996 --> 00:52:02,793
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

546
00:52:05,034 --> 00:52:06,228
l'm stuck!

547
00:52:06,402 --> 00:52:10,338
Oh, my God. He's stuck.
Please, get me out! Get me out!

548
00:52:10,506 --> 00:52:14,966
-Get me out, out, out!
-Hey, calm down, calm down.

549
00:52:16,745 --> 00:52:18,406
Get me out of here.

550
00:52:18,614 --> 00:52:22,015
Elena, you need to reach up
and help him.

551
00:52:23,252 --> 00:52:25,482
l need you to reach up and help him.
Reach up.

552
00:52:31,327 --> 00:52:34,763
-Conor. Conor, can you crawl up here?
-Yeah.

553
00:52:35,598 --> 00:52:37,930
Get me out! Get me out!

554
00:52:38,367 --> 00:52:40,335
Get me out of here!

555
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:47,675
l'm gonna die. l'm gonna die.

556
00:52:47,843 --> 00:52:50,937
Now, you feel that screw
on the other side?

557
00:52:51,113 --> 00:52:53,104
-Yeah.
-Turn it to the left.

558
00:52:53,883 --> 00:52:55,316
You got it?

559
00:52:55,551 --> 00:52:57,382
Elena. Elena.

560
00:52:57,553 --> 00:53:01,819
Hey, hey. Nelson tells me you're on
your way to see your little brother.

561
00:53:03,292 --> 00:53:05,226
ls he older or younger?

562
00:53:05,394 --> 00:53:07,191
-He's younger.
-Younger?

563
00:53:07,363 --> 00:53:09,388
Yeah, he was always so small.

564
00:53:09,565 --> 00:53:13,661
Elena, you don't want your little brother
to think you didn't come.

565
00:53:13,836 --> 00:53:15,133
You understand?

566
00:53:15,304 --> 00:53:18,398
-No. l'm too scared!
-Just reach up and grab Nelson's foot.

567
00:53:18,574 --> 00:53:19,768
-Come on.
-Please.

568
00:53:19,942 --> 00:53:21,239
Promise me l get to see him!

569
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:23,241
-Reach up and grab his foot!
-Push my foot.

570
00:53:23,412 --> 00:53:24,902
Promise me l get to see him!

571
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:28,311
Okay, l promise.
l promise you'll see him, just reach up.

572
00:53:29,652 --> 00:53:31,552
There you go. There you go!

573
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,982
Now push!

574
00:53:33,622 --> 00:53:35,988
Just breathe. Come on, you got it!

575
00:53:36,592 --> 00:53:39,561
Push, Elena.
Push him up! That's it, Elena!

576
00:53:39,728 --> 00:53:42,595
Push! You got it, there, yeah!

577
00:53:43,999 --> 00:53:46,365
You got it, there you go!

578
00:53:46,535 --> 00:53:48,162
l did it, l did it, l did it.

579
00:53:48,337 --> 00:53:51,670
-Oh, thank you.
-Now climb!

580
00:53:52,441 --> 00:53:54,534
-Hurry, hurry!
-Come on, do it again.

581
00:53:55,411 --> 00:53:57,072
lt's-- lt's too tight.

582
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,475
Oh, my God.

583
00:53:59,949 --> 00:54:01,712
How are we going up there?

584
00:54:01,884 --> 00:54:03,215
We're working on it.

585
00:54:05,387 --> 00:54:08,550
We need something up here
we could use as a screwdriver.

586
00:54:08,724 --> 00:54:10,089
A coin, a ring, anything.

587
00:54:10,259 --> 00:54:11,783
l can't even get into my pockets.

588
00:54:12,261 --> 00:54:13,853
Wait, wait!

589
00:54:17,766 --> 00:54:19,461
Oy vey, that would be ironic.

590
00:54:23,405 --> 00:54:26,932
Conor, you're gonna do this.
Don't worry. Here we go.

591
00:54:27,109 --> 00:54:29,339
Hurry! Hurry!

592
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:32,638
Hurry up!

593
00:54:32,815 --> 00:54:34,783
-Okay, turn it to the left.
-Okay.

594
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:36,383
Come on.

595
00:54:36,552 --> 00:54:39,248
Can you reach it? Don't drop it.

596
00:54:40,522 --> 00:54:41,750
Come on!

597
00:54:41,924 --> 00:54:43,983
-ls that working?
-Yeah.

598
00:54:46,228 --> 00:54:48,059
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

599
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:50,323
Come on, we got it.

600
00:55:15,824 --> 00:55:18,418
Don't worry, sweetie,
Dylan's right behind me.

601
00:55:20,462 --> 00:55:22,828
This thing's sealed from the other side!

602
00:55:23,232 --> 00:55:24,756
lt's the only way out.

603
00:55:26,168 --> 00:55:29,035
-Except for this, maybe.
-Another vent? No, not again.

604
00:55:29,204 --> 00:55:31,434
No, wait a minute. What's this up here?

605
00:55:33,075 --> 00:55:34,975
Dylan, give me your hand.

606
00:55:36,178 --> 00:55:37,702
l need somebody's help!

607
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:49,387
-We'll be okay.
-Got it.

608
00:55:49,558 --> 00:55:51,526
There you go. Any idea where we are?

609
00:55:51,693 --> 00:55:54,184
We got two more levels after this,
come on.

610
00:55:57,566 --> 00:55:58,965
Got him?

611
00:56:08,677 --> 00:56:10,577
Oh, my God. What is this place?

612
00:56:10,746 --> 00:56:14,477
This is a ballast tank. They fill these up
to keep the ship stable.

613
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:18,347
That valve right there leads to the tank
next door. That may be our way through.

614
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:19,987
May be? What other way is there?

615
00:56:20,155 --> 00:56:23,215
lt's a pressure valve. lt won't open
unless there's tremendous pressure.

616
00:56:23,392 --> 00:56:26,520
-Oh, don't tell us we're trapped.
-No, no, it'll open.

617
00:56:26,695 --> 00:56:27,923
How?

618
00:56:28,097 --> 00:56:31,430
By flooding this entire tank.

619
00:56:31,934 --> 00:56:33,629
-What?
-Exactly.

620
00:56:33,802 --> 00:56:37,203
-No. You don't even know if it's gonna open!
-That's insane. lt's nuts.

621
00:56:37,372 --> 00:56:40,341
-Wait a minute. We drown ourselves?
-No. No one's drowning.

622
00:56:40,509 --> 00:56:41,703
That valve will open...

623
00:56:41,877 --> 00:56:45,677
...and the water'll carry us from one tank
to the next till we find an open hatch.

624
00:56:45,848 --> 00:56:48,749
-How do we know there's an open hatch?
-Or if we can find it...

625
00:56:48,917 --> 00:56:51,351
-...before we run out of air?
-lt's our only option!

626
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,045
What about the a.c. vent down there?
We never tried that.

627
00:56:54,223 --> 00:56:56,384
-Let's try the new vent.
-l can't go. l'm sorry.

628
00:56:56,558 --> 00:56:58,890
-Just go without me.
-Mom, the water's coming!

629
00:56:59,061 --> 00:57:00,289
Get away.

630
00:57:00,462 --> 00:57:03,056
-Dylan, listen to me.
-We need to make a decision.

631
00:57:09,271 --> 00:57:12,035
You better be right. Flood it.

632
00:57:12,207 --> 00:57:14,437
-Oh, my God.
-Everybody, back up. Get back!

633
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:16,635
-What? No.
-Dylan, you can't.

634
00:57:16,812 --> 00:57:20,373
-Now, get back there.
-Jen, come here. Come here, honey.

635
00:57:20,549 --> 00:57:23,609
-Get back! Back up! Ready?
-Just open the valve!

636
00:57:27,723 --> 00:57:30,715
-Now! Over here!
-All right, stay calm.

637
00:57:37,866 --> 00:57:39,925
-Come on, just grab on!
-l can't--

638
00:57:43,438 --> 00:57:44,700
Nelson!

639
00:57:45,607 --> 00:57:46,938
Nelson.

640
00:57:50,712 --> 00:57:52,543
Hang onto the side!

641
00:57:53,348 --> 00:57:55,248
-Chris!
-Baby, hold on tight!

642
00:57:55,417 --> 00:57:56,611
-That's it.
-Oh, my God!

643
00:57:59,154 --> 00:58:01,179
-Start swimming!
-Hold on, baby!

644
00:58:01,356 --> 00:58:02,618
Hold on!

645
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:16,201
Get away from it!

646
00:59:37,853 --> 00:59:39,445
You okay?

647
00:59:39,621 --> 00:59:40,986
Come on!

648
00:59:48,597 --> 00:59:49,928
Dad!

649
00:59:51,266 --> 00:59:53,257
-You all right?
-Yeah.

650
00:59:54,369 --> 00:59:57,702
Where's Dylan? Dylan!

651
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,907
Where's Dylan? Can you see him?

652
01:00:01,143 --> 01:00:05,637
There's a-- There's an open hatch.
Right here. Take a deep breath.

653
01:00:05,814 --> 01:00:07,475
-We're gonna go through.
-How far?

654
01:00:07,649 --> 01:00:10,140
-Take a deep breath!
-Right here.

655
01:00:11,386 --> 01:00:13,820
-ls there a way out?
-l'm sure there is.

656
01:00:13,989 --> 01:00:16,355
-Maggie!
-Okay.

657
01:00:16,525 --> 01:00:19,085
-Maggie, give him to me.
-No, l've got him.

658
01:00:19,261 --> 01:00:23,027
Let me take him. l was a swimmer
in high school. l tell you, l got him.

659
01:02:24,419 --> 01:02:26,011
Where's Nelson and Elena?

660
01:02:26,188 --> 01:02:28,452
They were right behind me.

661
01:02:44,039 --> 01:02:46,507
Sweetie, move back.

662
01:03:20,075 --> 01:03:22,168
Come on, breathe!

663
01:04:28,643 --> 01:04:30,167
Come on, everybody.

664
01:04:33,081 --> 01:04:34,480
Come on.

665
01:04:51,466 --> 01:04:54,026
You were never on the swim team.

666
01:04:54,936 --> 01:04:56,494
Nope.

667
01:05:25,233 --> 01:05:27,827
Think we got a hallway here.

668
01:05:30,538 --> 01:05:32,267
Let's go.

669
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:35,671
All right. Come on, come on.
There we go. There we go.

670
01:05:39,147 --> 01:05:40,136
Here.

671
01:05:41,383 --> 01:05:43,510
Conor, go back to Dylan!

672
01:05:44,386 --> 01:05:46,650
Hang on a second.
Wait, wait, wait!

673
01:05:47,489 --> 01:05:49,184
What is it?

674
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:54,357
-lt's a rescue.
-Hello!

675
01:05:54,529 --> 01:05:56,861
-Hey, hello! Hello!
-Hello!

676
01:05:57,032 --> 01:05:59,296
-Hello!
-We're inside!

677
01:05:59,467 --> 01:06:00,934
-Hello!
-ls anybody there?

678
01:06:01,102 --> 01:06:02,592
-Hello!
-Hello!

679
01:06:02,771 --> 01:06:06,070
-Hey, we're here!
-Can you hear us?

680
01:06:07,709 --> 01:06:10,007
-Hello!
-We're here!

681
01:06:10,812 --> 01:06:12,973
Hello? What is it?

682
01:06:13,415 --> 01:06:14,905
lt's nothing.

683
01:06:44,212 --> 01:06:45,440
Flash fire.

684
01:06:46,514 --> 01:06:50,848
Superheats the air.
Burns the lungs like rice paper.

685
01:06:54,789 --> 01:06:56,654
Hey, guys. Down here. Down here.

686
01:07:05,066 --> 01:07:08,229
-What do you got?
-Down this corridor is the bow, right?

687
01:07:08,403 --> 01:07:11,964
There's an access hatch right there
that puts us into the bow-thruster room.

688
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:15,837
We get into the propeller tubes and the
only thing between us and the outside...

689
01:07:16,010 --> 01:07:17,978
-...is nothing.
-All right. Let's go.

690
01:07:18,146 --> 01:07:20,080
Let's go. That's our way out.

691
01:07:27,322 --> 01:07:29,916
All the way to the end, and up the hatch.

692
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:40,561
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

693
01:07:40,735 --> 01:07:42,032
Conor!

694
01:07:49,310 --> 01:07:52,643
-Bow's underwater.
-What does that mean?

695
01:07:52,814 --> 01:07:55,578
-The thrusters are under there.
-How far? Maybe we can swim.

696
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:58,048
No. lt's too far.

697
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:01,282
There's something else we can do, right?

698
01:08:01,456 --> 01:08:03,287
What do you think?

699
01:08:04,626 --> 01:08:05,854
Hey.

700
01:08:10,532 --> 01:08:12,227
All right.

701
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,233
All right, we gotta get back up
to high ground.

702
01:08:16,304 --> 01:08:18,966
We're gonna find another way out of here.
Break into twos.

703
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:22,837
Everybody start looking for
an emergency exit, any exit. Let's go.

704
01:08:31,653 --> 01:08:33,484
Come on.

705
01:08:56,644 --> 01:08:58,805
Have you found anything?

706
01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:02,973
Nothing. There's just no way out.

707
01:09:29,110 --> 01:09:34,309
You know, there's nothing fair
about who lives and dies.

708
01:09:34,482 --> 01:09:37,110
You gave Elena a chance.

709
01:09:37,952 --> 01:09:40,318
You gave everybody a chance.

710
01:09:42,690 --> 01:09:43,679
You did great.

711
01:10:15,757 --> 01:10:18,726
-What is that?
-Oh, my God, not again. Conor!

712
01:10:55,096 --> 01:10:56,393
Conor!

713
01:11:04,772 --> 01:11:06,205
Maggie!

714
01:11:33,634 --> 01:11:36,728
That cleared the bow!
Come on, let's go! Come on.

715
01:11:36,904 --> 01:11:38,997
We can get out now.

716
01:11:40,174 --> 01:11:41,766
Come on.

717
01:11:48,182 --> 01:11:50,116
You go.

718
01:11:55,823 --> 01:11:57,654
Maggie! Maggie!

719
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:00,587
Maggie!

720
01:12:01,696 --> 01:12:03,425
Maggie!

721
01:12:05,233 --> 01:12:07,224
Oh, my God.

722
01:12:07,435 --> 01:12:10,302
Maggie. Maggie. Hey, hey.

723
01:12:10,471 --> 01:12:13,167
Are you hurt? Are you hurt?

724
01:12:13,808 --> 01:12:15,435
-Conor! Conor!
-Are you okay?

725
01:12:15,610 --> 01:12:20,104
Maggie, we'll find him. We'll find him.
Come on. Come on!

726
01:12:20,281 --> 01:12:21,578
Conor!

727
01:12:38,833 --> 01:12:41,825
That's gotta be the propeller tube.

728
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:45,134
Come on!
Come on, look for an opening.

729
01:13:02,423 --> 01:13:03,913
What is that?

730
01:13:07,562 --> 01:13:10,429
No. No. No. No, Nelson, don't!

731
01:13:16,003 --> 01:13:17,595
-l got him. Come on.
-Lift.

732
01:13:17,772 --> 01:13:19,763
Pick him up. Ease back.

733
01:13:21,175 --> 01:13:22,904
Watch his head.

734
01:13:43,197 --> 01:13:44,824
-Conor!
-Conor!

735
01:13:44,999 --> 01:13:46,523
Mom!

736
01:13:48,102 --> 01:13:50,093
Mom!

737
01:13:50,872 --> 01:13:52,271
Conor!

738
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:01,375
Chris. Chris, come here!

739
01:14:01,549 --> 01:14:04,382
You gotta hurry,
the water's rising fast!

740
01:14:04,852 --> 01:14:07,286
l wanna show you something. Here.

741
01:14:07,455 --> 01:14:09,855
Here. Take a look at this.

742
01:14:13,828 --> 01:14:17,423
The control room for these engines
is down this ladder...

743
01:14:17,598 --> 01:14:19,589
...and through about
1 50 feet of water.

744
01:14:19,767 --> 01:14:22,133
We have to get there and shut them off.

745
01:14:22,303 --> 01:14:24,703
No. No, look, we'll grab a bunch
of this junk, right?

746
01:14:24,872 --> 01:14:27,568
We throw it up into the props,
and it'll jam everything up.

747
01:14:27,742 --> 01:14:31,075
The propellers are turning the wrong way.
lt'll kick everything back in.

748
01:14:31,245 --> 01:14:33,406
Chris, we need to shut them off.

749
01:14:34,882 --> 01:14:37,146
-Conor!
-Conor!

750
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,678
Honey.

751
01:14:41,923 --> 01:14:44,790
-Honey!
-l'm in here!

752
01:14:44,959 --> 01:14:47,257
-Conor?
-Mom!

753
01:14:50,932 --> 01:14:52,661
Maggie, here!

754
01:14:54,802 --> 01:14:56,030
Honey!

755
01:14:59,273 --> 01:15:01,173
Oh, God. Oh, honey.

756
01:15:01,342 --> 01:15:04,641
-How'd you get in there?
-l don't know, but the water's really high.

757
01:15:04,812 --> 01:15:08,145
Look at me. Dylan's here,
and we're gonna get you out, okay?

758
01:15:08,316 --> 01:15:10,876
Oh, my God, he's gone under! Conor!

759
01:15:11,419 --> 01:15:14,786
Okay, look at me. Look at me.
Stay with me, okay?

760
01:15:14,956 --> 01:15:17,322
l can't, l can't. l can't stay up.

761
01:15:17,491 --> 01:15:21,518
-l can't find an access hatch.
-Baby, look at me. Look at me.

762
01:15:21,696 --> 01:15:23,994
-l can't, l can't.
-Yes, you can.

763
01:15:24,165 --> 01:15:25,826
-l can't stay up, Mom.
-Yes, you can.

764
01:15:40,448 --> 01:15:43,645
But no one can swim that far.
We'll find another way.

765
01:15:45,586 --> 01:15:47,053
You know how much l love you.

766
01:15:48,689 --> 01:15:51,157
Yes. Yes, but don't do this.

767
01:15:51,626 --> 01:15:55,118
-Dad. Dad, please!
-You're not gonna make it, sir.

768
01:15:55,296 --> 01:16:00,063
You just won't! l mean, come on,
it's ridiculous. lt's too far, you know it.

769
01:16:00,234 --> 01:16:03,692
But l think that l could make it.
l think l could do it on one breath.

770
01:16:03,871 --> 01:16:06,271
How would you get back?
You'd already be out of air.

771
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:08,101
One of us has to do this, all right?

772
01:16:08,276 --> 01:16:11,677
lt has to be the one that has the best
chance of making it, and that's me.

773
01:16:11,846 --> 01:16:14,747
-Tell me l'm wrong.
-Dad.

774
01:16:16,083 --> 01:16:17,550
You're not.

775
01:16:19,253 --> 01:16:20,777
Chris...

776
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:25,784
-...thank you.
-Yeah.

777
01:16:31,966 --> 01:16:34,867
Baby, l need you to tell me
that you love me.

778
01:16:38,105 --> 01:16:40,938
l need to hear it. lt's all that matters.

779
01:16:51,652 --> 01:16:53,586
Sir, l need you to tell me how l--

780
01:16:55,790 --> 01:16:57,485
Daddy!

781
01:16:57,658 --> 01:17:00,923
No! Daddy!

782
01:17:16,544 --> 01:17:19,513
-Nothing.
-No, please!

783
01:17:20,448 --> 01:17:25,511
Look, baby, the water's gonna rise,
and l am right here, okay?

784
01:17:25,686 --> 01:17:29,349
l'm right beside this wall
touching you, okay?

785
01:17:29,523 --> 01:17:30,820
l love you, Mom.

786
01:17:30,991 --> 01:17:34,984
You have to be strong. l love you,
and l am here with you, okay?

787
01:17:40,601 --> 01:17:42,501
Dylan!

788
01:19:33,214 --> 01:19:35,614
-Oh, baby.
-Mom.

789
01:19:43,324 --> 01:19:44,586
-Sweetie.
-Mom.

790
01:19:49,630 --> 01:19:51,928
Jenny. Jen, listen.

791
01:20:13,487 --> 01:20:14,954
Come on.

792
01:20:22,796 --> 01:20:24,559
Okay, it's here.

793
01:20:33,073 --> 01:20:35,507
Robert! Robert!

794
01:20:41,515 --> 01:20:42,948
Dylan, over here!

795
01:20:44,718 --> 01:20:46,777
-Where's Robert?
-The engines were running.

796
01:20:46,954 --> 01:20:51,448
Control room's underwater. He wouldn't
let me go. He shut them down.

797
01:20:51,625 --> 01:20:53,559
How long? How long?!

798
01:20:58,365 --> 01:20:59,992
Wait! What's that?

799
01:21:21,522 --> 01:21:23,513
Why are they still running?

800
01:21:27,995 --> 01:21:31,055
He reversed the engines!
He's creating suction!

801
01:21:31,231 --> 01:21:34,132
And we can throw junk up
into the props!

802
01:21:34,301 --> 01:21:35,598
He's a genius!

803
01:21:39,239 --> 01:21:41,264
Chris! The red tank!

804
01:21:58,492 --> 01:22:01,393
Get back! Get back!

805
01:22:35,829 --> 01:22:37,456
No!

806
01:22:45,639 --> 01:22:47,334
l can't. l can't.

807
01:22:57,518 --> 01:22:58,951
No!

808
01:23:04,858 --> 01:23:06,416
Dylan!

809
01:23:16,804 --> 01:23:18,533
Get out!

810
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:35,388
Dylan, no!

811
01:23:54,091 --> 01:23:57,254
-Come on! Give me Conor!
-l'll take him.

812
01:23:59,797 --> 01:24:02,664
Come on! Stay there.

813
01:24:11,975 --> 01:24:13,636
Jen, come on, we gotta go.

814
01:24:14,278 --> 01:24:17,008
Jen, we gotta go now. Come on.

815
01:24:54,918 --> 01:24:56,249
We gotta jump.

816
01:25:11,301 --> 01:25:12,598
Get to the raft.

817
01:25:12,769 --> 01:25:16,000
Got it?
Hold on tight, honey!

818
01:25:25,782 --> 01:25:28,649
Can you grab him? Grab him.
You got him?

819
01:25:42,866 --> 01:25:45,767
-Guys, move!
-Oh, my God!

820
01:25:45,936 --> 01:25:48,166
-No! Come on!
-Climb up!

821
01:25:52,276 --> 01:25:53,709
Come on!

822
01:25:55,245 --> 01:25:56,803
Come on, paddle!

823
01:25:57,581 --> 01:25:59,139
Paddle!

824
01:26:00,384 --> 01:26:01,908
Mom!

825
01:27:11,321 --> 01:27:13,016
Ready?

01:28:01,505 --> 01:28:03,097
-Mom!
-There. There they are!

01:28:03,607 --> 01:28:05,541
-Yeah!
-Look, Mom!

-Oh, baby.
-Mom.

01:28:11,648 --> 01:28:13,275
Mom!
