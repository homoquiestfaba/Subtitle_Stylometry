That's my girl.

183
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:42,120
What were you
thinking, dad?

184
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,990
That move has never
worked on me.

185
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:46,591
You home for the holidays?

186
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:48,326
Uh, kind of,
for the holidays.

187
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:49,895
You're not spending it
with that new guy?

188
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:51,696
I googled him.
I gotta know

189
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:52,831
What my little girl
is up to.

190
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,065
Guys, guys, guys, look.

191
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,534
I'm so happy
to see you, but...

192
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:58,303
I'm actually not just
here for the holidays.

193
00:08:58,305 --> 00:08:59,437
I got a call.

194
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:00,939
Marty's motorcycles?

195
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:02,607
I put your name
in the christmas raffle.

196
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,276
I got a call from manucci.

197
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:06,745
He's still got 20 years
on his sentence.

198
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:08,079
He's out.

199
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:09,848
And he's coming for us.

200
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,249
For me.

201
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:12,584
He threatened you?

202
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:14,619
I was always afraid of this.

203
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,421
You took him out when
you were just a teenager.

204
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:17,822
That drove him crazy.

205
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:20,458
Well then, we gotta
take him down again.

206
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,793
Put him away for good.

207
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:23,094
I'll get cousin bones
to put a tail

208
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:24,896
On manucci's sister.

209
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,733
I wanna know where
big donna's heading.

210
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,635
Nobody threatens the bells.

211
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:32,404
Nobody.

212
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,843
Welcome home, tornado.

213
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:45,517
Let's get to work.

214
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,554
[gale]
our tail said big donna
should be here.

215
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:57,329
Yep, big donna's
definitely here.

216
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,370
You and me, we'll suit up
so donna and her bodyguards

217
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,339
Don't pick us out.

218
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:39,004
Mom? What's up?

219
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:42,774
You never could get
your hair right yourself.

220
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,309
[chuckles]

221
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,949
[tory coughs]

222
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:52,183
Still gorgeous.

223
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,252
That does not look like me.

224
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:56,287
Used to.

225
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:59,190
Can't believe I got
my baby girl back.

226
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:01,059
You sure you're
up for this?

227
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:03,028
Yeah, I'm cool.

228
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,234
Ma?
Yeah, hon?

229
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:11,569
What if someone sees me
in these pants?

230
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:12,737
[gale chuckles]

231
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:15,306
Let's go catch a bad guy.

232
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:20,679
[tory]
you sure I look okay?

233
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:24,582
[gale]
I think you look gorgeous.

234
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,921
Wow.

235
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:31,222
[tory]
he's your tail?

236
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:32,824
Just cause you two broke up

237
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:34,993
Doesn't mean we fired him.

238
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:38,029
Hey, come here.

239
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,565
Be careful out there.

240
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:43,601
I love sounding official.

241
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,175
What?

242
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:52,077
Electric blue pumps
look good on you.

243
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,379
Very funny,
but I have work to do.

244
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:55,880
You tweaking
on seeing me again?

245
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,549
I'm not tweaking,
I just...

246
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,918
I wanna get this done, and
I don't want any distractions.

247
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,286
I'm a distraction now?

248
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:02,620
Say, I used to be
your partner.

249
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:04,155
I have a new boyfriend now.

250
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,457
And a new life.

251
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,258
I heard. In fact,
most of trenton has heard.

252
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,260
Investment banker.
Pretty fancy.

253
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:10,962
Okay, as much as I'm
enjoying this small talk,

254
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:12,764
This is what
we're going to do.

255
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:14,399

00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,312
Right.

Tornado to banshee one.

263
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:30,014
Any sighting of the target?

264
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:32,517
No target present.
Black hawk?

265
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,085
No visual.

266
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,954
Ho ho ho!

267
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:55,440
I've got her.
She's definitely covered.

268
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,351
<i>[gale]</i>
<i>did she spy you?</i>

269
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:10,188
No, she's looking at shoes.

00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,424
Hideous shoes, but shoes.

271
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:16,461
<i>[hawk]</i>
<i>and the bodyguards?</i>

272
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:19,164
Too close.
We can't move yet.

273
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,916
She's at the salon.

274
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:39,350
There's no way they'll
let the bodyguards

275
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:40,952
Into the treatment rooms.

276
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:43,755

to take them out.

00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,211
I just need someone
to touch up my gels.

279
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:09,013
Sure, let me see
what I can do.

280
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,482
Whenever you
have an opening.

281
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:13,218
Move, now.

282
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,930
It's true what they say.

283
00:14:25,932 --> 00:14:27,665
The right undergarment
makes a woman

284
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,567
Feel like a woman.

285
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,471
You coming?

286
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:37,775
She'll be in there a while.

287
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:39,010
Ain't that the truth?

288
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:40,178
All right, I'm going
to hit the head.

289
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,247
All right.

Ho ho ho.

going anywhere.

00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:40,852
Lizzie the legs.

333
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:43,521
Shaved, moisturized,
and ready for action.

334
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:45,089
Liz, I would love to catch up,
but this really is--

335
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:48,059
First of all, you never
told me you were coming back.

336
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:50,228
What the front-door
is that all about, huh?

337
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,529
I missed you, girl.

338
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:53,397
I--
second, I thought

339
00:18:53,399 --> 00:18:54,565
You got out of
the family business.

340
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:55,900
That's why you left.

341
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:57,068
She thought she did too,

342
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:59,637
But we pulled her back in.
Well, I'm glad.

343
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,039
Liz, I got a great
teaching job there.

344
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:04,642
So, what, you went
to manhattan, that's it?

345
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,211
It's only through
the holland tunnel.

346
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:10,047
I guess it's also
kind of a different world.

347
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:13,618
It is to some people.

348
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,454
Liz, I am so sorry
I didn't call.

349
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:17,855
I-- I meant to,
it's just that I--

350
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:19,490
You got all caught up
in your new guy.

351
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,559
Been there, done that.

352
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:23,594
But you can't forget
your girlfriends.

353
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:25,563
I know.
So...

354
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:26,864
How does it all work, tory?

355
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:29,367
I mean, big banker
and a bounty hunter?

356
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:32,003
Yeah, how does that work?

357
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,472
It works fine.

358
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:37,275
I'm not a bounty hunter
anymore.

359
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:38,643
This is just
kind of a one-off.

Oh. Okay, well...

361
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,814
I hope this whole visit
isn't just a one-off.

362
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:45,483
It'd be nice to hang out
with you again.

363
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:48,886
For sure.

364
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:50,054
Later, mikey-boy.

365
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:53,124
Over and out, legs.

366
00:19:53,126 --> 00:19:54,659
[man]
smile!

367
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,797
I get why you don't
wanna hang out with me.

368
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,266
Since I'm your
smokin' hot ex-boyfriend.

369
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:03,501
Ha-ha, very funny.

370
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:05,169
Thank you.

371
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:06,671
Tory, there's a lot of people

372
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:08,639
On this side of the bridge
who still care about you.

373
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:10,174
You might wanna
think about that

374
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:12,710
While you're so busy
planning your new life.

375
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:54,118
Worked like a charm.

376
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,021
[locater beeps]

377
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,930
Good.

378
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,101
What do you think?

379
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,637
If he's in there, that service
door is his access point.

380
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:14,038
No fugitive ever wants
to be too far away

381
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,039
From his vehicle.

382
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,340
Gale, watch
the front entrance.

383
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:17,441
I'm gonna take
the east exit.

384
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:18,876
The two of you
stay together.

385
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:21,212
Could be a trap.

386
00:21:21,214 --> 00:21:23,114
Go.

387
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:35,793
[mike strains]

388
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,681
Really?

389
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:11,128
Okay.

390
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,798
That works too.

391
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:25,943
They're here.

392
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:28,379
Leopold?

393
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:30,314
That girl is mine.

394
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:32,717
You got it, boss.

395
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,751
You hungry?

[voice]
tory?

397
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:19,029
Tory?

398
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:22,767
I know you're here,
I used that app I showed you--

399
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:41,952
Mike, 12 o'clock!

400
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:45,956
All right.

401
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:58,068
Did the bear just explode?

402
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,013
Who's this guy?

403
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:10,514
This?

404
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:13,217
Uh...

405
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:15,186
Dad, james.

406
00:24:15,188 --> 00:24:17,655
James, dad.

407
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:21,358
All right, here we go.

408
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:25,396
How is he?

409
00:24:25,398 --> 00:24:27,264
Delicious and fine.

410
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:28,098
It was just a bump.

411
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,800
Thanks for
the house call, liz.

412
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,436
It's nice having a nurse
in your contacts, isn't it?

413
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:34,839
Yeah.

414
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:36,507
Liz, I'm-- I'm sorry

415
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:38,742
I let so much time
pass between us.

416
00:24:38,744 --> 00:24:40,611
You were always
a really good friend.

417
00:24:40,613 --> 00:24:42,313
I still am.

418
00:24:42,315 --> 00:24:45,382
You should give me
a test drive sometime.

419
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:47,418
You got it.

420
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:50,754
So, aside from
mr. Delicious,

421
00:24:50,756 --> 00:24:52,723
What's so great
in manhattan?

422
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:54,492
Uh, well, in manhattan,

423
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:58,028
I-- I can be...Tory.

424
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,965
You know, in trenton,
everyone sees me as tornado.

425
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:03,367
It's like this role
I fell into that never ends.

426
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:05,402
I thought you loved
being a bounty hunter.

427
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:07,872
No, I do. I did.

428
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:10,674
But, no, I like the...

429
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,343
Other parts of me.

430
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:13,711
You know, when I met james,

431
00:25:13,713 --> 00:25:15,179
That's all he saw.

432
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:18,616
Just the other parts of me,
and it felt great.

433
00:25:18,618 --> 00:25:20,117
The guys here, they just--

434
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:21,619
Just sees me as
one of the guys.

435
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:23,487
One guy didn't.

436
00:25:23,489 --> 00:25:26,457
Yeah, well, I guess
I wanted an option other than

437
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:28,526
Mikey muscles.

438
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:30,227
I understand.

439
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:31,996
All right,
house call's over.

440
00:25:31,998 --> 00:25:34,164
I gotta get back to work.
All right.

441
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:40,304
Thanks again.

442
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,354
Okay, I just need

443
00:25:57,356 --> 00:25:59,890
To make a few
little adjustments.

444
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,725
What's she doing
with redneck santa?

445
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:04,061
I just want the place
to look nice.

446
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,163
Honey, I worked for hours
getting it just right.

447
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:10,000
Okay. Okay, this stuff
cannot be in the house.

448
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:11,835
What're you
so worried about?

449
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:14,672
He doesn't know about the...

450
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:16,941
Family business.

451
00:26:16,943 --> 00:26:18,976
You didn't tell him
we're bounty hunters?

452
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:22,546
It, uh, never came up.

453
00:26:22,548 --> 00:26:24,048
I know, I know,
I know, it's just,

454
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,950
James is not just
another boyfriend.

455
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:27,484
He's from a whole
different world.

456
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:30,588
Mom, you know,
you googled him.

Tornado renee bell.

458
00:26:32,658 --> 00:26:34,558
You can't hide yourself.

459
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,760
She's not hiding herself.

460
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:37,928
She's hiding us.

461
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,964
I'm not hiding you.

462
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:41,599
I love you guys.

463
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:44,702
I do, it's just, well,

464
00:26:44,704 --> 00:26:47,538
This would be a bit
of a shock for james.

465
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,207
I just need
to ease him into it.

466
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:51,375
Please.

467
00:26:51,377 --> 00:26:55,346
Please help me.
Just play along.

468
00:26:55,348 --> 00:26:57,114
Okay, honey, okay.

469
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,115
How?

470
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,684
Just act... Normal.

471
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:02,386
Can do.

472
00:27:02,388 --> 00:27:03,621
We got your back, tor.

473
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:06,590
Consider it done.

474
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:09,026
What do you mean by normal?

475
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:10,761
Well, let's start with
putting the girls away.

476
00:27:10,763 --> 00:27:13,330
Well, I'll try, but
the girls aren't exactly shy.

477
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:16,400
Okay, ma, normal people
don't say things like that.

478
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:17,768
Got it.

479
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:21,538
Okay, uh...

481
00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:26,744
Do you have any...

483
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,480
Ain't doing it.

Do it.
Done.

485
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:34,518
Use mine.
Anything else, sweetie?

Um...

Sweetie?

494
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:05,616
Oh, thank god.

495
00:28:05,618 --> 00:28:08,118
Ah, I thought I was...

496
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,188
Did that cheese
come out of a can?

497

Honey, I am so glad
you're feeling better.

498
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,793
You really
hit your head hard.

499
00:28:15,795 --> 00:28:18,162
Ow, I did?
Yeah.

Oh, nice to meet you all.

Oh, very festive tree.

507
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:41,852
And crossbow.

508
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:44,655
I know, right?
That was a wedding gift.

509
00:28:44,657 --> 00:28:46,256
My dear.

510
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:50,027
Aw, don't mind if I do.

511
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:55,766
Libation?

512
00:28:55,768 --> 00:28:58,202
You know, I think james
should rest some more.

513
00:28:58,204 --> 00:29:01,505
No no no,
really, I'm fine.

514
00:29:01,507 --> 00:29:03,674
So, I've never been
in this part of new jersey.

515
00:29:03,676 --> 00:29:05,542
It's very--
[electricity sizzles]

516
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:07,578
Oh!

517
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:15,719
Is that a weapon?

518
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:18,422
Nah, it's just a stun-gun.

519
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:20,724
For a little peace of mind,
you know what they say.

520
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:23,994
Criminals always come to the
nice side of town to steal.

521
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:25,763
Right, of course.

522
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:27,231
[police radio chatter]

523
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:31,135
Not to worry, that's
just my police scanner.

524
00:29:31,137 --> 00:29:33,270
Computer game
that I play nonstop.

525
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,738
That's why it's always on.

526
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,039
Oh, you're a gamer?

527
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,975
At work, I have excel tetra.

[women chuckle]

531
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:46,683
Wow, that's impressive.

532
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:48,819
See, we're all
getting along so well.

533
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:50,387
Yes we are, mrs. Bell,

534
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:52,156
And I am so happy about that

535
00:29:52,158 --> 00:29:54,024
Because I actually came here

536
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:56,160
To speak to mr. Bell.

537
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:58,662
Me?
Yes.

538
00:29:58,664 --> 00:30:00,864
I know you don't
know much about me.

539
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:03,467
And that I haven't been
dating tory for very long.

540
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:06,670
So your mind must be
filled with questions.

541
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:08,005
Who is this man?

542
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:09,740
What does he stand for?

543
00:30:09,742 --> 00:30:12,709
Where is he from?

544
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:14,144
Well, here are
some answers.

545
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:17,781
My name is james oswald
ballantine the third.

546
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:19,283
Fancy.
Mom.

547
00:30:19,285 --> 00:30:22,653
I come from the upper
east side of manhattan.

548
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:24,755
And I stand for

549
00:30:24,757 --> 00:30:26,623
Whatever makes tory happy.

550
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,192
Oh my.

551
00:30:28,194 --> 00:30:29,660
I know you feel protective.

552
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:31,428
Protective? You
obviously haven't

553
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,597
Seen my girl
choke someone out.

554
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:35,699
Up. Choke someone up.

555
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:37,968
With emotion.

556
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,136
Tory's got a lot of heart.

557
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:40,871
A crazy amount.

558
00:30:40,873 --> 00:30:43,440
Oh, I know.

559
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:45,475
And that's why
the real reason

560
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:47,277
I came here today,
mr. Bell, was

561
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,081
To ask your permission

562
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:54,184
To propose to your daughter.

563
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,121
[mom gasps]

564
00:31:01,726 --> 00:31:02,960
What'd I miss?

565
00:31:02,962 --> 00:31:06,396
Tory's getting married!

566
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,131
Some ring you got her.

567
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:43,233
Well, she's worth it.

568
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,675
Well, I didn't unscrew
the good stuff for nothing.

569
00:31:51,677 --> 00:31:53,243
Let's celebrate!

570
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:55,279
I say we take this party
to boccino's.

571
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:57,214
Honey, you were
banned from there.

572
00:31:57,216 --> 00:31:59,383
Oh yeah.

573
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:01,018
Boccino's sounds good.

574
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,053
But don't we have
work to do?

575
00:32:03,055 --> 00:32:04,288
Serious work?

576
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,290
Tory, you gotta
celebrate tonight.

577
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:07,891
This is everything
you've ever wanted.

578
00:32:07,893 --> 00:32:10,794
But... I don't have
clothes for boccino's.

579
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:11,862
Of course she does.

580
00:32:11,864 --> 00:32:14,665
But... I need, um,

581
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:16,767
Boccino's
is kind of a dive.

582
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:19,436
Oh, your favorite bar
is suddenly a dive.

583
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:22,039
A dive bar, really?

584
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:23,440
Good, 'cause I can't tell you

585
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,142
How sick I am of cristal.

586
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:27,177
[they laugh]

587
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:28,412
I know, I know,

588
00:32:28,414 --> 00:32:30,614
You and me both, right?

589
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:31,815
What is that?

590
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:33,650
Ma, help me get dressed.

591
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:36,219
Okay.

592
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:38,588
So you like the ring?

593
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:43,226
Hello, jersey.

594
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:44,928
I know, right?

595
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,064
I picked out
all your faves.

596
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:48,332
So many choices.

597
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:50,367
And so little time.

598
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:56,206
Help with your hair?

599
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:59,609
Oh, not tonight, ma.

600
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:01,945
I know it's
not quite your style.

601
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:04,247
Me, I'd say it
needs more gold.

602
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:06,183
But it's nice.

603
00:33:06,185 --> 00:33:07,384
Thanks, ma.

604
00:33:07,386 --> 00:33:09,820
For trying so hard
with james.

605
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:14,958
You got what
you wanted, tory.

606
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,928
A new life. Manhattan.

607
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,532
You're always gonna be
my little girl.

608
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:25,936
And I'm gonna miss you.

609
00:33:25,938 --> 00:33:28,538
But I'm so happy for you.

610
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,574
Thanks, ma.

611
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:37,714
Tory, if you wanna go back
to new york with james,

612
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:39,349
We get it.

613
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:41,918
Between us and mike,
we can handle manucci.

614
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,988
No, I put manucci away
the first time.

615
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,923
He's back because of me.

616
00:33:46,925 --> 00:33:50,660
And I'm gonna put him away
the second time too.

617
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,000
Like it or not,

618
00:33:57,002 --> 00:33:59,503
You're a bell.

619
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:09,546
Okay...

620
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:17,788
[loud music plays]

621
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,327
Oh my god!

622
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:27,330
Tory, that's like
the taj mahal in rock.

623
00:34:27,332 --> 00:34:29,099
Uh, james, this
is nurse stonebrook.

624
00:34:29,101 --> 00:34:31,835
But I've known her my entirely
life as lizzie the legs.

625
00:34:31,837 --> 00:34:33,870
You can use elizabeth
if it feels better to you.

626
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:36,306
Uh, no way, I much prefer

627
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:37,407
"lizzie the legs."

628
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,742
Oh my god, he's so cute.

629
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:39,843
I could just...

630
00:34:39,845 --> 00:34:42,712
Mikey muscles,
what brings you by?

631
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:44,381
I just missed
the big moment.

632
00:34:44,383 --> 00:34:46,349
I couldn't miss
the celebration.

633
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:47,918
Mike.
Yeah, tory.

634
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,288
Don't take it personally.
Exes are like that.

635
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:54,424
And by exes,

636
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,393
I just meant...

637
00:34:56,395 --> 00:34:57,761
I'm gonna stop now.

638
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:59,029
Do you need to use
the bathroom?

639
00:34:59,031 --> 00:35:01,031
No.
Yes, you do.

640
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,702
You dated him?

641
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:06,703
Young and dumb.

642
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:08,872
Well, how long
did you guys go out?

643
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:11,408
Oh, I wouldn't even
call it going out.

644
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,677
It was over
before it began.

645
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:15,045
He used to work for my dad,

646
00:35:15,047 --> 00:35:16,279
And... You know.

647
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:17,848
Right, right.

648
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:20,317
Tory, what kind of business
is your dad in?

649
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:23,220
I mean, when you mentioned that
your father was a businessman,

650
00:35:23,222 --> 00:35:24,387
I kind of pictured--
james.

651
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:26,323
I want to explain
it all to you.

652
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:28,725
And I will, but it's
a little complicated,

653
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:31,495
And I just wanna
do it at the right time.

654
00:35:31,497 --> 00:35:34,397
Honey, can we please just

655
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:36,566
Celebrate tonight?

656
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:38,435
Yes.

657
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,304
Hi.

658
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:42,606
Sorry about that, tory.

659
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:44,040
I figured you told him
about mike.

660
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:47,244
I was going to,
but this thing came up.

661
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:49,779
Plus, mike and I are
done. It's over.

662
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:51,448
If you say so.

663
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,150
Come on,
there's a coat girl.

664
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:54,417
Oh, no no. It's fine.

665
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:55,752
I think I'll keep it on.

666
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:58,388
Come on, tory,
you gotta move.

667
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,557
Come on, bell, dance.

668
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,095
You look gorge!

669
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,699
Now you're talking!

670
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,106
How long have
you known tory?

671
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:17,607
Since junior high.

672
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:19,442
You?

673
00:36:19,444 --> 00:36:21,311
Ten months.

674
00:36:21,313 --> 00:36:22,679
Ten months.

675
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,648
Dude doesn't waste any time.

676
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:26,783
Well, when it's meant to be,
it's meant to be.

677
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,285
What're you drinking?

678
00:36:28,287 --> 00:36:29,920
Uh, well, uh,

679
00:36:29,922 --> 00:36:32,556
I think champagne
is appropriate.

680
00:36:32,558 --> 00:36:35,625
Can I get a champagne
for my friend, and a--

681
00:36:35,627 --> 00:36:37,627
Shot and a beer chaser,
mike?

682
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:39,162
How'd you guess?

683
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:40,897
Actually,
forget the champagne.

684
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:42,299
I'll have what he's having.

685
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:44,668
A shot and a beer.

686
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:47,070
Chaser.

687
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:51,174
Oh, looks like your ex
and your man are getting along.

688
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:53,910
Oh shoot.

689
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:56,713
Help me.

690
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,216
So, what do you do?

691
00:36:59,218 --> 00:37:00,850
Uh, well, we...

692
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:03,019
Look for companies
that are in trouble,

693
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:04,988
And we acquire them.

694
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,623
Sounds like we're
in the same business,

695
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:09,292
Except we find people
in trouble, and we--

696
00:37:09,294 --> 00:37:10,961
Okay, stop being such guys

697
00:37:10,963 --> 00:37:13,096
And get your butts
on the dance floor.

698
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:15,365
Ah, I'm waiting on a shot.

699
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:17,334
And a beer chaser.

700
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:18,702
Fine, I'll go easy on you

701
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:20,503
'cause it's your
first night tonight.

702
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:22,906
Muscles, don't
make me play hard.

703
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:24,541
You win, legs.

704
00:37:24,543 --> 00:37:26,042
Here you go.

705
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:30,714
Thank you.

706
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:33,917
Pookie, hi!

707
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:42,459
Hi.
Hi.

708
00:37:42,461 --> 00:37:44,928
Woo.

709
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,297
Nice work today.

710
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:48,999
You too.

711
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:57,240
Okay, should we talk?

712
00:37:57,242 --> 00:37:58,608
About what?

713
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,610
Well--
three years later,

714
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,345
You're engaged.
Now you wanna talk?

715
00:38:02,347 --> 00:38:04,014
You know when
I wanted to talk?

716
00:38:04,016 --> 00:38:06,483
Before you ditched me
and left town.

717
00:38:06,485 --> 00:38:08,051
I know I didn't
handle it well.

718
00:38:08,053 --> 00:38:10,320
But mike, it wasn't
anything you did.

719
00:38:10,322 --> 00:38:11,821
It was me.
Wow.

720
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:14,457
That's what it feels like
to hear that.

721
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:15,892
What?

722
00:38:15,894 --> 00:38:17,827
It's not you, it's me.

723
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:21,064
I use that line

01:01:43,734 --> 01:01:46,101
Let's make a deal, bell.

1085
01:01:46,103 --> 01:01:49,171
I mean, after all,
prince charming over here,

1086
01:01:49,173 --> 01:01:51,339
He's not the one
who caught me.

1087
01:01:51,341 --> 01:01:55,143
And sent me away
for six years.

1088
01:01:55,145 --> 01:01:57,045
What are you proposing?

1089
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:59,681
I let him go.

1090
01:01:59,683 --> 01:02:02,350
And you, well...

1091
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:06,955
You come with me.

1092
01:02:09,859 --> 01:02:13,695
Tory, or whoever
you actually are,

1093
01:02:13,697 --> 01:02:15,664
Don't.

1094
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:27,476
[manucci laughs]

1095
01:02:27,478 --> 01:02:29,311
Yeah.

1096
01:02:29,313 --> 01:02:31,980
Yeah, that's
a good bell, huh?

1097
01:02:33,683 --> 01:02:35,684
Chin up.

1098
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:56,238
It's going to be okay.

1099
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:57,305
Just try and stay calm.

1100
01:02:57,307 --> 01:02:59,741
Please, "calm"
is my middle name.

1101
01:02:59,743 --> 01:03:01,643
Or "sort of calm."

1102
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,414
Three fingers, duck.

1103
01:03:06,416 --> 01:03:08,049
What?

1104
01:03:23,432 --> 01:03:25,534
[tory groans]

1105
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:36,411
Tory? Baby?

1106
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:40,949
Tory, you okay?

1107
01:03:40,951 --> 01:03:42,317
Okay, james, stay right here.

1108
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,819
No no no.
Don't move. Don't move!

1109
01:03:43,821 --> 01:03:45,754
No, tory!

1110
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:07,242
Open the door!

1111
01:04:07,244 --> 01:04:10,045
Open the door!

1112
01:04:10,047 --> 01:04:12,414
Do it!

1113
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:28,063
[manucci screams]

1114
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:04,799
She's good.

1115
01:05:04,801 --> 01:05:06,167
She's really good.

1116
01:05:06,169 --> 01:05:08,270
She's a bell.

1117
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:24,219
Watch your head.

1118
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:30,592
Escaped convict with
a new attempted murder charge.

1119
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:33,795
He's not gonna see the light
of day for a long time.

1120
01:05:33,797 --> 01:05:35,630
You're amazing, tory.

1121
01:05:35,632 --> 01:05:38,767
But you probably
already know that.

1122
01:05:38,769 --> 01:05:40,135
I do.

1123
01:05:40,137 --> 01:05:41,803
But you can tell me anyway.

1124
01:05:41,805 --> 01:05:43,371
I could tell you.

1125
01:05:43,373 --> 01:05:45,340
I could stand here
and tell you all day

1126
01:05:45,342 --> 01:05:47,575
That every time I see you
or talk to you,

1127
01:05:47,577 --> 01:05:51,212
It's as exciting as
the first time I saw you.

1128
01:05:51,214 --> 01:05:53,315
How I love
watching you fight.

1129
01:05:53,317 --> 01:05:54,916
But I also love watching you

1130
01:05:54,918 --> 01:05:57,519
Walk and talk and just be.

1131
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:01,890
But there's another guy
who wants to do that.

1132
01:06:01,892 --> 01:06:03,091
A great guy.

1133
01:06:03,093 --> 01:06:04,626
Who can give you
a good life.

1134
01:06:04,628 --> 01:06:08,530
The new life
you wanted so much.

1135
01:06:08,532 --> 01:06:11,766
Lizzy keeps telling me
how you've changed.

1136
01:06:11,768 --> 01:06:13,134
She's right.

1137
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:15,103
There is something
different about you now.

1138
01:06:15,105 --> 01:06:18,239
I'm even more handsome?

1139
01:06:18,241 --> 01:06:19,941
What changed, tory, is you.

1140
01:06:19,943 --> 01:06:21,876
You left and I realized
you needed more than just

1141
01:06:21,878 --> 01:06:24,279
Mike muscles,
although he was fine.

1142
01:06:24,281 --> 01:06:26,915
In your eyes.

1143
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:31,086
So I took some
courses at college.

1144
01:06:31,088 --> 01:06:32,520
I'm pre-law now.

1145
01:06:32,522 --> 01:06:34,956
Get out!
Word of honor.

1146
01:06:34,958 --> 01:06:36,858
Losing you changed me.

1147
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:38,326
So maybe the next

1148
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:41,496
Beautiful, smart,
motivated butt-kicker

1149
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:45,600
That walks into my life
will have a reason.

1150
01:06:45,602 --> 01:06:47,569
To stay.

1151
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:04,319
Your guy's waiting.

1152
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:15,630
[police radio chatter]

1153
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:21,970
My hero.

1154
01:07:21,972 --> 01:07:23,138
You okay?

1155
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:25,373
Uh-huh.

1156
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:27,776
So, crazy, but I thought

1157
01:07:27,778 --> 01:07:30,578
You meeting my family
was the big hurdle.

1158
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:34,849
I should've never
lied to you.

1159
01:07:34,851 --> 01:07:37,352
No, you shouldn't have.

1160
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,121
Because I can't help
but wonder

1161
01:07:40,123 --> 01:07:41,890
What else wasn't true, tory?

1162
01:07:41,892 --> 01:07:44,993
Your name is tory, right?

1163
01:07:44,995 --> 01:07:47,095
I'm sorry.

1164
01:07:47,097 --> 01:07:48,463
If I was just
honest with you,

1165
01:07:48,465 --> 01:07:50,398
I know none of this
would've happened.

1166
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,534
You wouldn't have
been knocked out.

1167
01:07:52,536 --> 01:07:54,402
Well, that's actually
happened before

1168
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:55,737
On the slopes of chamonix.

1169
01:07:55,739 --> 01:07:57,939
You would've
never been zapped.

1170
01:07:57,941 --> 01:07:59,107
That was a first.

1171
01:07:59,109 --> 01:08:00,241
Kidnapped?

1172
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:02,143
Ditto.

1173
01:08:02,145 --> 01:08:03,711
But it was
kind of a rush.

1174
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:11,252
I just wish you'd given me
a chance to love the real you.

1175
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:13,121
Because...

1176
01:08:13,123 --> 01:08:14,656
The woman I met in new york

1177
01:08:14,658 --> 01:08:17,025
And the woman I met here...

1178
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:22,464
They're both pretty amazing.

1179
01:08:22,466 --> 01:08:25,433
So now that
all three of us have met,

1180
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:30,705
Can we try again?

1181
01:08:30,707 --> 01:08:33,208
A big part of me

1182
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:35,910
Wants to say yes.

1183
01:08:35,912 --> 01:08:38,546
But these last few days,

1184
01:08:38,548 --> 01:08:40,582
I've learned

1185
01:08:40,584 --> 01:08:43,718
An even bigger part
of me realized

1186
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:48,022
I'm still a bounty-hunting,

1187

[sighs]

1191
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:03,505
Well, I'm gonna miss you,
jersey girl.

1192
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:33,001
Bell? What the--

1193
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:46,681
Welcome back to jersey.

1194
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:57,759
[gale]
okay, attention,
attention.

1195
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:00,595
I just want to say,

1196
01:10:00,597 --> 01:10:02,697
Welcome home to my girl.

1197
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:05,099
We love you,
and we missed you,

1198
01:10:05,101 --> 01:10:06,868
And we are so happy

1199
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:08,603
That you are home,
I can't tell you.

1200
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:13,741
And because you and mikey
work so well together,

1201
01:10:13,743 --> 01:10:15,944
I was thinking,
me and my banshee

1202
01:10:15,946 --> 01:10:17,712
Could take some time off

1203
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:20,615
And go on that honeymoon
we've been talking about.

1204
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:24,085
What're you saying?

1205
01:10:24,087 --> 01:10:25,653
Follow me.

1206
01:10:25,655 --> 01:10:27,188
What're you doing?

1207
01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:29,824
Aww.

1208
01:10:29,826 --> 01:10:32,293
Crazy man.
Wait for it, wait for it.

1209
01:10:32,295 --> 01:10:34,696
Ah.
[gale gasps]

1210
01:10:34,698 --> 01:10:35,930
Oh!

1211
01:10:35,932 --> 01:10:37,498
Whoa!

1212
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,033
You--

1213
01:10:39,035 --> 01:10:41,436
Daddy, you are so romantic.

1214
01:10:41,438 --> 01:10:43,504
Oh, it's the best
christmas present

1215
01:10:43,506 --> 01:10:45,440
I ever got.

1216
01:10:45,442 --> 01:10:47,976
I'd love to ride
with my guy.

1217
01:10:49,478 --> 01:10:51,312
Ho ho ho!

1218
01:10:51,314 --> 01:10:53,214
Ooh! Fancy.

1219
01:10:53,216 --> 01:10:54,482
Look at you two.

1220
01:10:54,484 --> 01:10:57,085
Must be working
some kind of magic.

1221
01:10:57,087 --> 01:10:58,720
I know a trick or two.

1222
01:10:58,722 --> 01:11:00,355
I wanted to drop off
my famous--

1223
01:11:00,357 --> 01:11:01,956
Cookies?! Liz's
christmas cookies?

1224
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:04,859
Hot, sweet, and straight
from the oven.

1225
01:11:04,861 --> 01:11:08,296
Whoa, save some.
Yeah, right.

1226
01:11:08,298 --> 01:11:10,098
So, what's this I hear about

1227
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:12,800
You staying in jersey?

1228
01:11:12,802 --> 01:11:15,803
There's nowhere
I'd rather be.
