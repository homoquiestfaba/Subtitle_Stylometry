01:06:18,041 --> 01:06:19,174
four hundred and fifty,

906
01:06:19,176 --> 01:06:20,709
four hundred and fifty five,

907
01:06:20,711 --> 01:06:22,177
four hundred and sixty,

908
01:06:22,179 --> 01:06:23,445
four hundred and seventy...

909
01:06:23,447 --> 01:06:25,180
[Helen]
Either I just saw somebody

910
01:06:25,182 --> 01:06:26,715
pretending they couldn't walk

911
01:06:26,717 --> 01:06:30,051
taking money
from good church-going people

912
01:06:30,053 --> 01:06:33,722
or I'm witnessing a miracle.

913
01:06:33,724 --> 01:06:34,556
Which is it?

914
01:06:35,459 --> 01:06:36,992
Miracle?

915
01:06:38,395 --> 01:06:40,762
As a pastor, it is my duty

916
01:06:40,764 --> 01:06:42,263
to try to help you
and your daughter.

917
01:06:42,265 --> 01:06:43,999
Oh, he's not my dad.

918
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:48,336
What is your relationship
to this child?

919
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:49,604
- Uncle.
- Neighbor.

920
01:06:50,273 --> 01:06:52,207
A neighbor
who tries to sell cars.

921
01:06:52,209 --> 01:06:53,341
I'm more like a family friend.

922
01:06:54,011 --> 01:06:55,443
No, just neighbor.

923
01:06:55,445 --> 01:06:57,379
Ana would like to apologize.

924
01:06:58,081 --> 01:06:59,347
Yes, I'm sure she would.

925
01:07:00,117 --> 01:07:01,182
I'm sorry.

926
01:07:02,085 --> 01:07:03,518
The church teaches forgiveness.

927
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,353
And penance.

928
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:06,588
Fraud is a serious matter.

929
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:09,224
[Chuckling]
Obviously, she's gonna--

930
01:07:09,226 --> 01:07:10,458
She's gonna give back the money.

931
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:13,028
And perhaps a small atonement
could be made,

932
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:15,430
if, say, she did a little work
at the church.

933
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:18,066
Well, we'd be happy to come back
another time,

934
01:07:18,068 --> 01:07:19,167
but right now

935
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:21,503
I'm kind of in a crisis.

936
01:07:21,505 --> 01:07:23,338
Or we could call the police.

937
01:07:26,376 --> 01:07:28,209
[Door opens]

938
01:07:29,479 --> 01:07:30,545
[door closes]

939
01:07:34,251 --> 01:07:35,784
Thank you.

940
01:07:35,786 --> 01:07:37,185
[Ana] Welcome.

941
01:07:40,057 --> 01:07:42,123
It's good being on the road.

942
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:43,358
Isn't it?

943
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,193
Why don't we stay here

944
01:07:45,195 --> 01:07:47,228
and never go back to San Juan?

945
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,466
You should bring your sons here.

946
01:07:53,203 --> 01:07:54,569
It'd be really nice.

947
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:56,087
They have a busy life.

948
01:07:56,088 --> 01:07:57,604
They have family,
they have kids.

949
01:07:59,142 --> 01:08:00,408
What are their names?

950
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:03,244
Nicolás

951
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:05,080
and Andrés.

952
01:08:05,082 --> 01:08:06,347
Why don't you see them?

953
01:08:09,219 --> 01:08:11,186
You can just get
a flight to Miami

954
01:08:11,188 --> 01:08:12,687
or get them to get a flight.

955
01:08:16,393 --> 01:08:17,392
Cheers.

956

967
01:09:03,206 --> 01:09:04,472
All right, Ana.

968
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:06,207
I want you to tell the story

969
01:09:06,209 --> 01:09:08,243
exactly as we discussed

970
01:09:08,245 --> 01:09:09,878
about how the church and prayer

971
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:12,747
has helped you live
with your disability, okay?

972
01:09:18,455 --> 01:09:20,355
Thank you, Pastor Helen.

973
01:09:20,357 --> 01:09:22,690
My name is Zuleika,

974
01:09:22,692 --> 01:09:24,559
and this is my story.

975
01:09:25,295 --> 01:09:27,395
When I was five,
my father became a drunk

976
01:09:27,397 --> 01:09:29,330
and pushed me down some stairs.

977
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:30,632
I broke my legs.

978
01:09:31,568 --> 01:09:33,368
They told me
I would never walk again.

979
01:09:33,904 --> 01:09:35,170
A few days ago,

980
01:09:35,172 --> 01:09:36,471
I met a kind man.

981
01:09:37,174 --> 01:09:38,940
That's him right there.

982
01:09:38,942 --> 01:09:41,609
[Whispering]

983
01:09:41,611 --> 01:09:44,445
[Ana] He'd lost everything
through his misguided behavior.

984
01:09:44,447 --> 01:09:46,247
He was a heavy gambler,

985
01:09:46,249 --> 01:09:47,949
and he took tablets
for his vagina.

986
01:09:47,951 --> 01:09:50,318
[Laughter]

987
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:52,487
But he told me
the story of Saint Tino.

988
01:09:53,423 --> 01:09:56,658
One day, Tino was leading
his cow beside a small lagoon

989
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:58,726
and the cow slipped on a rock
and fell in,

990
01:09:59,396 --> 01:10:01,196
pulling Tino with him.

991
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:04,232
Tino thought he would drown.

992
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:09,304
So he put his hands together
and said a prayer.

993
01:10:12,943 --> 01:10:16,211
Tino stood up and was amazed
to see that he could walk again.

994
01:10:16,513 --> 01:10:18,613
A few days ago,
I went there myself

995
01:10:19,282 --> 01:10:21,482
and I gently dipped my legs in,

996
01:10:21,952 --> 01:10:23,484
and I said a prayer.

997
01:10:31,628 --> 01:10:35,396
[Gasping]

998
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:36,531
Oh, my God.

999
01:10:36,533 --> 01:10:39,500
[Applause]

1000
01:10:53,617 --> 01:10:56,384
[Helen] What an amazing story.

1001
01:10:56,386 --> 01:10:57,518
Gentlemen.

1002
01:10:57,988 --> 01:11:00,321
Open your hearts, everybody.

1003
01:11:00,323 --> 01:11:01,990
Tell your friends and family

1004
01:11:01,992 --> 01:11:04,993
about what you have seen
and heard today.

1005
01:11:04,995 --> 01:11:09,597
Bring them to our church to hear
this miracle for themselves.

1006
01:11:17,507 --> 01:11:19,707
[Ana] If we get ten percent
for every atonement,

1007
01:11:19,709 --> 01:11:21,643
we can pay Diego on time,

1008
01:11:21,644 --> 01:11:23,578
and I bet I can get her
to raise our cut.

1009
01:11:31,554 --> 01:11:33,755
We're just trying to make it
through the crisis, Rafa.

1010
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:39,460
[Sad song plays]

1011
01:11:56,046 --> 01:11:57,645
Come on, let's go. Bedtime.

1012
01:11:57,647 --> 01:11:58,613
Good night.

1013
01:12:00,083 --> 01:12:01,316
[Rafa] Ana!

1014
01:12:02,519 --> 01:12:04,319
[Ana] My name is Zuleika,

1015
01:12:05,088 --> 01:12:06,654
and this is my story.

1016
01:12:07,457 --> 01:12:09,724
When I was five,
my father became a drunk

1017
01:12:09,726 --> 01:12:11,859
and, in one
of his drunken rages,

1018
01:12:11,861 --> 01:12:13,795
he pushed me down the stairs.

1019
01:12:13,797 --> 01:12:15,463
I broke my backbone.

1020
01:12:15,865 --> 01:12:18,399
They told me
I would never walk again.

1021
01:12:18,401 --> 01:12:21,636
Until a few days ago, when I
heard the story of Saint Tino,

1022
01:12:21,638 --> 01:12:24,505
a crippled farmer who thought
God had forsaken him

1023
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:27,408
because he was poor
and he couldn't walk well.

1024
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:29,877
One day, Tino was walking
his favorite cow

1025
01:12:29,879 --> 01:12:32,113
beside a small lagoon

1026
01:12:32,115 --> 01:12:34,615
when the cow slipped on a rock
and fell in,

1027
01:12:34,617 --> 01:12:37,418
pulling Tino with him
into the dark depths.

1028
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:40,088
Tino thought he would drown
because the cow was sinking,

1029
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:42,557
so he tried to swim,
but he didn't have enough air.

1030
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:46,094
So then he put his hands
together, he said a prayer.

1031
01:12:46,096 --> 01:12:49,564
And suddenly, the waters
of the well rose up.

1032
01:12:49,566 --> 01:12:51,699
Whoosh...

1033
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:53,868
And placed him gently
on the grass,

1034
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:56,738
as if God's hands
are made out of water.

1035
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:01,843
[Rafa] Camila!
Wait, let me explain.

1036
01:13:01,845 --> 01:13:04,712
After hearing that story,
I was inspired.

1037
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:06,514
My friend took me there.

1038
01:13:06,516 --> 01:13:08,716
Using a child to make money?

1039
01:13:09,519 --> 01:13:10,818
No. Listen.

1040
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:13,121
Embezzling? From a church?

1041
01:13:13,123 --> 01:13:14,422
I'm not embezzling from them.

1042
01:13:14,424 --> 01:13:15,590
It's more complicated than that!

1043
01:13:15,592 --> 01:13:18,159
I used to have
feelings for you, Rafael.

1044
01:13:18,161 --> 01:13:21,462
I said a prayer and...

Now I understand
why your business went bad.

1048
01:13:35,478 --> 01:13:36,677
Because you're a crook.

1049
01:13:37,147 --> 01:13:38,146
Because you are a crook!

Let's go. We're out of here.

You wanna call the police?
Go ahead. Call the police.

1065
01:14:47,951 --> 01:14:49,750
'Cause what you're doing here
is not only fraud,

1066
01:14:49,752 --> 01:14:51,819
you're taking advantage of
people who don't have anything

1067
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:54,555
which is exactly what's wrong
with this island right now.

1068

People like you coming in
and taking advantage.

1069
01:14:57,227 --> 01:14:58,092
And where are you from?

1070
01:14:59,963 --> 01:15:01,229
I'm from San Juan.

1071
01:15:01,231 --> 01:15:03,564
- But you're not Puerto Rican.
- I'm from Miami.

1072
01:15:03,566 --> 01:15:05,633
- [Helen] Oh, yeah? Miami-Cuban?
- Yes!

1073
01:15:05,635 --> 01:15:07,235
So you probably came here
to sell cars

1074
01:15:07,237 --> 01:15:09,103
because of
the Puerto Rican tax breaks?

1075
01:15:10,807 --> 01:15:12,907
I came here
for many reasons. Ana.

1076
01:15:12,909 --> 01:15:14,876
But you came here with the hope
of making more money

1077
01:15:14,878 --> 01:15:16,043
and paying less taxes.

1078
01:15:16,045 --> 01:15:17,645
So isn't that taking advantage?

1079
01:15:17,647 --> 01:15:18,880
[Ana] Look, Rafa.

1080
01:15:18,882 --> 01:15:20,882

there is inside this.
