1
00:02:05,187 --> 00:02:06,989
Okay, amigos.

2
00:02:07,089 --> 00:02:08,901
Vámonos.

3
00:02:17,832 --> 00:02:19,874
Fuck me.

4
00:02:23,973 --> 00:02:26,164
Comienza con la basura.

5
00:02:26,264 --> 00:02:27,958
Kapish?

6
00:02:31,513 --> 00:02:33,953
Fucking Christ!

7
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:13,794
Jesus Christ!

8
00:03:14,222 --> 00:03:16,030
Hey.

9
00:03:18,193 --> 00:03:21,397
Hey. Hey, wake up.

10
00:03:21,497 --> 00:03:23,510
Who the hell are you?

11
00:03:24,466 --> 00:03:26,836
Come on, you gotta get up.

12
00:03:27,702 --> 00:03:29,911
Who the hell are you?

13
00:03:32,941 --> 00:03:36,344
What do you mean who the hell am...
I'm sleeping here. Who the hell are you?

14
00:03:36,444 --> 00:03:39,582
Yeah, I see that, but you gotta get up.
Come on. Get up.

15
00:03:39,982 --> 00:03:43,323
- What day is this?
- Monday.

16
00:03:43,952 --> 00:03:45,759
Monday?

17
00:03:47,756 --> 00:03:52,428
- Come on, get up. Let's go.
- Yeah, it's okay. It's alright.

18
00:03:52,528 --> 00:03:56,350
It's not alright. Get up.
You gotta get up. Come on. Let's go.

19
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,688
Sheila's a friend of mine.
She lives here. I always stay here.

20
00:03:59,788 --> 00:04:01,575
- I don't know who Sheila is.
- It's okay. It's fine.

21
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:03,939
- Whoever was here was evicted, alright?
- It's fine, it's fine.

22
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:07,013
It's not fine.
Come on, get up. Let's go.

23
00:04:09,411 --> 00:04:11,218
Monday.

24
00:04:17,952 --> 00:04:20,961
- What're you doin'?
- She's comin' back.

25
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,863
- There's nobody comin' back, buddy.
- She told me she's coming back.

26
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:27,053
I'm just gonna wait here.

27
00:04:27,153 --> 00:04:32,203
There's nobody here. Didn't you notice
nobody lives here? How'd you get in here?

28
00:04:35,671 --> 00:04:37,540
Hey, listen to me, buddy,
you got two minutes, alright?

29
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,211
- Do what you gotta do, then you gotta go.
- No, no, no, no, no, no. No.

30
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:44,714
Can't do. There are laws.

31
00:04:44,814 --> 00:04:48,551
She's gonna take you to court case. No.

32
00:04:48,651 --> 00:04:50,553
Cannot do.

33
00:04:50,653 --> 00:04:53,957
She's comin' back here soon.
She'll be fine.

34
00:04:54,057 --> 00:04:57,960
- Alright, that's it. You gotta go.
- I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay.

35
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,764
I wanna stay here. She wanted me
to wait here for her.

36
00:05:01,864 --> 00:05:03,566
- So I'll stay here.
- Nobody comin' back.

37
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:06,420
- You wanna wait, wait outside.
- She's comin' back. She's not gonna lie to me.

38
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,106
I'm here with her. This is my home.
This... this is my home.

39
00:05:10,206 --> 00:05:15,337
Wait outside. You don't live here,
alright? I'm serious.

40
00:05:21,549 --> 00:05:23,286
What're you doin'?

41
00:05:23,586 --> 00:05:27,223
Did... did she...
Did she leave a number?

42
00:05:27,323 --> 00:05:31,093
- I don't even know who you're talking about?
- An address or something? Anything?

43
00:05:31,193 --> 00:05:33,429
- No. Time to go.
- Sheila.

44
00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:35,365
Let's go.

45
00:05:40,568 --> 00:05:44,942
Well, where's my...
where's my stuff? Where's my stuff?

46
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:47,943
I don't know where your stuff is.
Look around and then you gotta get out.

47
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:49,850
Come on.

48
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,447
- Hey.
- Is everything alright?

49
00:06:24,547 --> 00:06:27,854
- Yeah. It's a pigsty.
- You're kidding, right?

50
00:06:28,182 --> 00:06:30,329
No, I'm tellin' you.

51
00:06:31,085 --> 00:06:33,056
Well, I'm goin' upstairs now.

52
00:06:33,156 --> 00:06:37,562
The whole ceiling has collapsed...

53
00:06:38,027 --> 00:06:40,634
Hold on. I'll call you back.

54
00:06:42,297 --> 00:06:44,043
Hello?

55
00:06:45,868 --> 00:06:48,108
Anybody in there?

56
00:06:54,308 --> 00:06:56,083
Hello?

57
00:07:02,885 --> 00:07:04,925
Anybody home?

58
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,667
Hello?

59
00:07:21,336 --> 00:07:23,110
Hello?

60
00:07:53,134 --> 00:07:55,705
What do you want me to say?
I mean, he's your dad too.

61
00:07:55,805 --> 00:08:00,006
He's gotta eat.
If he doesn't eat, then what?

62
00:08:04,512 --> 00:08:06,916
You have to stay there.

63
00:08:07,016 --> 00:08:11,254
It takes him, like, an hour and half
but that's what it takes.

64
00:08:11,604 --> 00:08:13,889
- 2500?
- I said 2500.

65
00:08:13,989 --> 00:08:16,525
- Oh, give me a fuckin' break.
- Give you a break?

66
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:22,332
This guy. Not now, buddy. I told you,
I'm sorry. I can't help you, alright?

67
00:08:23,132 --> 00:08:25,941
I just wondered, could I borrow
some money? Someone took my wallet.

68
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,237
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry whatever happened.

69
00:08:28,337 --> 00:08:31,475
I just wanna find my lady.
I wanna find her...

70
00:08:31,575 --> 00:08:35,017
You're not gonna find her here.
I told you she's gone. What are you doin'?

71
00:08:35,117 --> 00:08:40,119
- What are you doin'? Come on.
- Thank you, mister. Thank you.

72
00:08:41,783 --> 00:08:44,954
- What the fuck did you do that for?
- What do you care?

73
00:08:45,454 --> 00:08:49,425
Come on, work with me, alright?
I can't do it for less than 4500.

74
00:08:49,525 --> 00:08:51,894
- 2500.
- You want half a job?

75
00:08:51,994 --> 00:08:54,029
- Look, just do it for 25.
- You want me to do half the work?

76
00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:58,033
What... Look, just do it for 25.
You know, put me down for 25.

77
00:08:58,133 --> 00:09:00,807
You know? You think you can.

78
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,039
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

79
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:05,979
You're welcome.

80
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,906
Yeah.

81
00:09:37,006 --> 00:09:41,510
You know there are options.
I've told you that so many times.

82
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:45,246
You know what?
You and me, we need to go out.

83
00:09:45,346 --> 00:09:48,784
Tonight. We can go... I'm sorry?

84
00:09:48,884 --> 00:09:53,627
How about Saturday?
Me and you, we can hit that spot...

85
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,095
How crazy is that?

86
00:10:27,321 --> 00:10:29,029
Hey.

87
00:10:41,603 --> 00:10:43,494
Hello.

88
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,846
Yes.

89
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,782
Who is it?

90
00:10:55,662 --> 00:10:57,749
Quién es?

91
00:11:00,523 --> 00:11:06,021
- Stop ringing that bell whoever you are.
- I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

92
00:11:09,597 --> 00:11:14,473
It's just some guy. Don't worry about it.
Relax. I'm gonna take care of it, alright?

93
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:16,342
Thanks.

94
00:11:16,504 --> 00:11:18,712
Jesus Christ!

95
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:33,922
Hey. Hey!

96
00:11:34,022 --> 00:11:36,425
- Come on. Wake up.
- Oh, good. I wanted to talk to you.

97
00:11:36,525 --> 00:11:39,061
I spoke to Sheila. I spoke to Sheila.

98
00:11:39,161 --> 00:11:42,898
She said, you know, that we should
stay here and wait with her. She's...

99
00:11:42,998 --> 00:11:45,367
- Wait outside, okay?
- She... she's...

100
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:49,641
- Come on. You gotta get up.
- I spoke to her. She was on a payphone.

101
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:55,110
Go outside and wait. You can't wait here.
You can't sleep here.

102
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:58,952
You cannot come back here.
Alright? Let's go. Come on.

103
00:12:00,614 --> 00:12:03,162
Hey. You alright?

104
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:06,748
What's the matter?

105
00:12:08,523 --> 00:12:10,325
- Hey, look.
- Cut me some slack, man.

106
00:12:10,425 --> 00:12:14,473
Come on. Come on. I'm not bothering
anybody. I'm not bothering anybody.

107
00:12:14,573 --> 00:12:17,405
You're scaring the neighbors.
Alright? Come on.

108
00:13:43,951 --> 00:13:46,026
Get some sleep.

109
00:14:27,728 --> 00:14:29,765
Okay, okay.

110
00:14:29,865 --> 00:14:32,697
Get some sleep. Get some sleep.

111
00:14:35,302 --> 00:14:37,366
Get some sleep.

112
00:14:54,556 --> 00:14:57,027
- Go!
- Jesus!

113
00:14:58,192 --> 00:15:00,834
- Hey!
- You nailed him!

114
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:28,736
I don't think so.

115
00:15:28,836 --> 00:15:31,323
- Really?
- No.

116
00:15:32,893 --> 00:15:36,403
Do you think we could, please?

117
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,468
Hey. Hey, guys.
Could I borrow some money?

118
00:15:39,568 --> 00:15:42,637
Hey, somebody stole my wallet.
I just I want to get a metro card.

119
00:15:42,737 --> 00:15:44,799
I just need it for a metro card,
that's all.

120
00:16:25,836 --> 00:16:30,201
Bird and the bees.
If you horny, you horny.

121
00:16:30,552 --> 00:16:33,489
Now, look. I get horny. Oh, now...

122
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:38,360
Keep your belongings in sight
at all times. Protect yourself.

123
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:43,002
If you see a suspicious package
or activity on the platform or train...

124
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:51,435
Can I just have your attention
for a couple of minutes.

125
00:16:51,535 --> 00:16:54,042
I just need a little bit of help.

126
00:16:54,442 --> 00:16:57,846
I have a couple of small children
and I wanna go and visit my husband

127
00:16:57,946 --> 00:17:02,618
who hasn't seen the kids in a while.
He's not doing that well.

128
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:05,792
Have it in your hearts
to just give me a little something.

129
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,545
Shit.

130
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,880
If you want to calm
your anxiety in your case,

131
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,595
you try to lose a bit of weight,
it could be whatever you like.

132
00:18:20,695 --> 00:18:23,265
One thing you can do is...

133
00:18:23,365 --> 00:18:25,634
run it through water, running water

134
00:18:25,734 --> 00:18:28,759
or if you're going camping,
in a river...

135
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:32,507
- Happy.
- Really?

136
00:18:32,607 --> 00:18:35,644
- Am I making you happy?
- Yeah.

137
00:18:35,744 --> 00:18:38,280
Are you sure? You were saying,
"No, no, no, no, no."

138
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,883
I thought I was making you mad.

139
00:18:40,983 --> 00:18:43,381
I thought I was making you mad.

140
00:19:20,287 --> 00:19:22,366
Stop, stop.

141
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:26,261
- Oh, well, that's a friendly hello.
- Yeah.

142
00:19:26,761 --> 00:19:30,809
- I needed a little bit of the old...
- You like that? Do that again.

143
00:19:30,909 --> 00:19:33,035
Do that again, do it again. Do it again.

144
00:19:33,135 --> 00:19:37,277
Kiss one of these? Kiss one of those.
It's pretty much a sweet spot, so...

145
00:19:40,641 --> 00:19:42,744
So bloody good.

146
00:19:42,844 --> 00:19:44,479
- They love music.
- The women are beautiful.

147
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:48,838
They actually care.
Not like here. They...

148
00:19:49,138 --> 00:19:51,163
They don't care as much about...

149
00:19:52,854 --> 00:19:54,628
Robert?

150
00:19:55,222 --> 00:19:56,949
Robert.

151
00:20:01,562 --> 00:20:06,146
Robert? Vanilla half caff soy latte.

152
00:20:10,671 --> 00:20:13,308
You're gonna be around
next time I come back?

153
00:20:13,408 --> 00:20:15,343
Yeah.

154
00:20:15,443 --> 00:20:17,646
I'm kind of constantly around,
it's funny.

155
00:20:17,746 --> 00:20:20,482
Yeah? Well, it's good to know.

156
00:20:20,582 --> 00:20:22,383
Yo.

157
00:20:22,883 --> 00:20:24,814
Man.

158
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,716
Look, I feel like you're gonna be late.

159
00:20:27,816 --> 00:20:31,164
- No, that's okay.
- I'm gonna be late, man.

160
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:34,529
- You should come have a drink with me.
- Oh, no, I can't, babe. I got to go.

161
00:20:34,629 --> 00:20:38,472
I got responsibilities and such. But...

162
00:20:42,069 --> 00:20:44,422
- But I got...
- Just stay.

163
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:47,447
Got to grab a taxi.

164
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:50,627
Alright, call me up.

165
00:20:50,727 --> 00:20:54,116
Alright. But I promise I will call you
when I get back to the city, alright?

166
00:20:54,216 --> 00:20:57,057
- Yeah, it was fun.
- Alright.

167
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:08,501
No, okay, well... put her on the phone.

168
00:21:10,131 --> 00:21:12,767
Yeah, yeah, yeah, please.

169
00:21:12,867 --> 00:21:15,374
- Hold on.
- Okay.

170
00:21:16,503 --> 00:21:18,713
No, come on.

171
00:21:19,574 --> 00:21:21,347
I'm serious.

172
00:21:22,175 --> 00:21:24,156
Hold on.

173
00:21:24,713 --> 00:21:26,717
- Hello?
- I'm back.

174
00:21:26,817 --> 00:21:30,686
I wanna go...
Hey, I can't really talk right now.

175
00:21:35,556 --> 00:21:37,392
Yeah.

176
00:21:37,492 --> 00:21:39,561
I've got a... I've got a...

177
00:21:39,661 --> 00:21:43,971
I've got a drink inside.
What? What is it?

178
00:21:52,673 --> 00:21:55,577
I agree. It's... it is very important.

179
00:21:55,677 --> 00:21:58,329
It's just now is not a good time.

180
00:21:58,847 --> 00:22:03,556
What? What is it? What do you...
what do you want to say?

181
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,937
Hey! You alright?

182
00:22:10,358 --> 00:22:13,995
- You're waiting for somebody or what?
- No, no, no.

183
00:22:14,095 --> 00:22:16,064
- Can I help you?
- No. No, no, no. No.

184
00:22:16,164 --> 00:22:20,873
You can... have right now? I'm just...

185
00:22:22,703 --> 00:22:25,553
Out. I'm... out, out.

186
00:22:27,007 --> 00:22:29,511
Yes! Yes!

187
00:22:29,711 --> 00:22:32,348
Reinforcements have arrived.

188
00:22:32,514 --> 00:22:34,514
- How are you? You're good?
- I'm good.

189
00:22:34,614 --> 00:22:39,058
Misunderstanding 'cause I don't think
I was accusing you of anything.

190
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,470
The way that I talk to you?

191
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:59,140
I was just upset.
It's like 2 in the morning and...

192
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,612
I want to go to bed with you
and not wanting to fight.

193
00:23:04,712 --> 00:23:08,049
- Let me talk to you a second.
- Sorry. You want to talk?

194
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:11,092
- No, I'm talking to someone.
- Hold on a second.

195
00:23:13,921 --> 00:23:16,577
You see the barmaid, the blonde?

196
00:23:21,294 --> 00:23:25,400
Would you give these to her?
It'll make her very happy.

197
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,603
- You want me to give these to this...
- Yeah. It's good. It's good.

198
00:23:28,703 --> 00:23:30,569
It's good.

199
00:23:31,239 --> 00:23:34,209
- What is this?
- It's good. You give them to her.

200
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:36,130
Okay.

201
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:41,004
- Okay?
- Yeah, I just... okay. Thank you.

202
00:23:41,316 --> 00:23:43,122
Shit.

203
00:23:43,517 --> 00:23:48,156
Someone just gave me pictures to give
to... look, I got to go. It's loud.

204
00:23:48,256 --> 00:23:51,393
There's fire trucks
and I'm just gonna go, okay?

205
00:23:51,493 --> 00:23:54,162
I'm... let me call you... let me
call you when I'm done, okay?

206
00:23:54,262 --> 00:23:57,331
I'll call you... I'll call you
when I'm leaving.

207
00:23:57,431 --> 00:24:00,719
Okay? Okay. Okay.

208
00:24:10,043 --> 00:24:11,613
- Maggie.
- Yep.

209
00:24:11,713 --> 00:24:14,768
This guy gave me
these pictures to give you.

210
00:24:16,683 --> 00:24:18,758
Is that you?

211
00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:25,511
This... this little girl,
looks like you.

212
00:24:27,528 --> 00:24:29,568
What?

213
00:24:30,931 --> 00:24:32,935
What are they?

214
00:24:33,535 --> 00:24:35,451
You alright?

215
00:24:35,737 --> 00:24:37,997
Yeah, I'm all good.

216
00:24:38,873 --> 00:24:41,280
We need pint glasses.

217
00:24:42,209 --> 00:24:45,585
Get it. Go. Make it happen.

218
00:25:04,431 --> 00:25:05,349
Hi. What's up?

219
00:25:05,449 --> 00:25:07,982
Just watch me, okay?
This homeless guy is in here.

220
00:25:08,082 --> 00:25:10,438
Oh, for cryin' out loud.
You want me to come in there?

221
00:25:10,538 --> 00:25:14,008
- No, I want you to watch.
- What am I watching?

222
00:25:14,108 --> 00:25:16,732
If my throat gets slit, you tell my mother
it was because you were too lazy

223
00:25:16,832 --> 00:25:18,823
to come in here.

224
00:25:19,414 --> 00:25:22,233
- I'm gonna... I'll come in there...
- No! Don't! Are you crazy?

225
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:24,800
Don't leave Tucker in the car
by himself. Just watch me.

226
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,433
I told you I could pick up the money in
the morning. How does that make me lazy?

227
00:25:31,224 --> 00:25:34,267
- What's happening?
- You want some help?

228
00:25:36,163 --> 00:25:38,371
What's happening?

229
00:27:05,118 --> 00:27:06,859
Sir?

230
00:27:07,521 --> 00:27:10,258
Sir, wake up. You alright?

231
00:27:10,358 --> 00:27:13,067
You're in the emergency room.

232
00:27:14,061 --> 00:27:15,763
- You okay?
- Yeah.

233
00:27:15,863 --> 00:27:18,151
You feeling alright?

234
00:27:22,435 --> 00:27:24,829
Yeah. I'm fine, I'm fine.

235
00:27:27,608 --> 00:27:30,372
Sir, do you remember how you got here?

236
00:27:34,415 --> 00:27:37,240
Are you waiting for anyone, love?

237
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,066
Yeah, yeah, yes.

238
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:45,760
I guess they left already.
I fell asleep.

239
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:50,792
- Well, can I help you in any way?
- No, no, I'm fine. I'll be fine. Thank you.

240
00:28:29,602 --> 00:28:32,106
You know there's a food pantry
in the mornin'

241
00:28:32,206 --> 00:28:35,501
at St. Bart's on 51st Street
if you're hungry.

242
00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:40,695
When I call, they usually bring around
some food about half five at night.

243
00:28:42,182 --> 00:28:44,610
No, I don't, I...

244
00:28:46,219 --> 00:28:50,592
I think I better go home.
I'm just a little bit...

245
00:28:54,761 --> 00:28:59,164
Sheila is gonna be worried sick.
I better get back.

246
00:29:02,903 --> 00:29:07,234
You don't have to go. You can stay.
No one will bother you here.

247
00:29:07,334 --> 00:29:10,372
Don't tell anybody I told you
that though, okay?

248
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:20,909
My grandmother
on my mother's side was Irish.

249
00:29:29,396 --> 00:29:31,604
Just enough.

250
00:29:32,699 --> 00:29:34,969
Do you like it here?

251
00:29:35,069 --> 00:29:37,772
- You mean the hospital or...
- No, no, no, America.

252
00:29:37,872 --> 00:29:41,299
You know, your accent. You haven't
been here very long, have you?

253
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:43,211
- Long enough.
- Yeah.

254
00:29:43,311 --> 00:29:45,780
No, I like it here.
I like it when I can get some sleep

255
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,249
which should be hopefully very soon.

256
00:29:48,349 --> 00:29:50,122
Yeah.

257
00:29:53,086 --> 00:29:54,793
Yeah.

258
00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:00,941
You know...

259
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:04,513
I've always been really,
very good with women.

260
00:30:05,132 --> 00:30:07,471
Women have always...

261
00:30:07,571 --> 00:30:10,641
been incredibly kind to me.

262
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,811
And... I really have no...

263
00:30:16,911 --> 00:30:19,852
place to go right now and...

264
00:30:21,281 --> 00:30:25,118
I'm not a bum. I'm clean.
I'm a very, very clean guy.

265
00:30:25,631 --> 00:30:27,889
I'm not a bad guest, really.

266
00:30:27,989 --> 00:30:30,596
I just... I'm in between.

267
00:30:32,525 --> 00:30:34,233
Sorry.

268
00:31:28,281 --> 00:31:30,184
See you next week.

269
00:31:30,284 --> 00:31:32,553
- Alright.
- Okay, later.

270
00:31:32,653 --> 00:31:34,860
Yeah, see you later.

271
00:32:03,767 --> 00:32:06,921
...and all those other terrorist
groups are watching all this.

272
00:32:07,021 --> 00:32:11,089
How the Hollywood media is doing...
it's getting into our homes and our...

273
00:32:19,199 --> 00:32:21,039
Okay.

274
00:33:04,712 --> 00:33:07,482
She said she's gonna look
over my resume.

275
00:33:07,582 --> 00:33:11,285
Well, they should get back to me,
I guess, in a day or so.

276
00:33:11,886 --> 00:33:14,259
I know. I hope I get in too.

277
00:33:23,396 --> 00:33:24,932
- No.
- No?

278
00:33:25,032 --> 00:33:27,068
It's a little bright.

279
00:33:27,168 --> 00:33:29,904
Are you here for English
as a second language?

280
00:33:30,004 --> 00:33:32,106
Meditation Mondays?

281
00:33:32,206 --> 00:33:34,998
Oh, I'm just looking for a coat.

282
00:34:08,975 --> 00:34:12,447
Hey! Hey, listen, you can't stay here.

283
00:34:12,547 --> 00:34:14,415
- It's not a Code Blue night.
- It's okay. It's alright.

284
00:34:14,515 --> 00:34:17,034
- No, it's not a Code Blue night.
- I'm just sitting here.

285
00:34:17,134 --> 00:34:22,390
No, no, no. No, you can sleep here
if it's 32 degrees below.

286
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:26,551
- But it's not 32 degrees below. Come on.
- Do you need to see a doctor?

287
00:34:26,651 --> 00:34:28,760
- No, he does not...
- If you're not feeling well...

288
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,238
- If you need some medical treatment.
- What temperature is it outside?

289
00:34:31,338 --> 00:34:33,901
It's more than 32.
You have to go. I'm sorry, sir.

290
00:34:34,001 --> 00:34:36,825
- There's wind chill. No.
- Please, sir.

291
00:34:36,925 --> 00:34:38,936
- There's a really bad wind.
- No. Listen...

292
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:42,076
I can't do anything about it.
Please don't make my life miserable.

293
00:34:42,176 --> 00:34:45,213
- I'm not bothering anybody here.
- It does not mat...

294
00:34:45,313 --> 00:34:46,914
- Do you know where Bellevue is?
- You can stay here.

295
00:34:47,014 --> 00:34:48,950
The homeless intake center? Go there.

296
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:52,686
- It's 30th and 1st Avenue.
- I can't believe this. There's nobody here.

297
00:34:52,786 --> 00:34:54,822
It doesn't matter.
I don't wanna get in trouble.

298
00:34:54,922 --> 00:34:58,459
I'm sorry, sir, about your situation.
Just please go.

299
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:01,333
- I don't wanna have to call the cops.
- Sorry.

300
00:35:01,694 --> 00:35:03,564
Thank you.

301
00:35:03,964 --> 00:35:06,132
What? I can't. No.

302
00:35:08,268 --> 00:35:11,105
And I said... I told her, I told her.

303
00:35:11,205 --> 00:35:13,975
A couple of days ago my husband
found out where I live.

304
00:35:14,075 --> 00:35:16,944
And he tossed me around the kitchen
and I hurt my back too.

305
00:35:17,044 --> 00:35:18,847
Come on.

306
00:35:19,547 --> 00:35:22,488
And I told her and I was hurt.

307
00:35:41,868 --> 00:35:44,776
That's it. I made a mistake.

308
00:35:44,937 --> 00:35:48,180
I made a mistake. Stupid.

309
00:36:03,323 --> 00:36:06,828
As you enter the facility
please take all outerwear off.

310
00:36:06,928 --> 00:36:10,031
Belts off.
All items out of your pockets.

311
00:36:10,131 --> 00:36:12,466
Remove all hats, scarves.

312
00:36:12,566 --> 00:36:15,903
Any unauthorized items,
please get rid of them now.

313
00:36:16,003 --> 00:36:18,472
As soon as your stuff
goes through the machine

314
00:36:18,572 --> 00:36:21,075
an officer will instruct you
to walk through the metal detector.

315
00:36:21,175 --> 00:36:24,160
Once your stuff is cleared from the x-ray
machine please bring the bin back,

316
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:28,120
get yourself set up and ready
for check in. Thank you.

317
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:32,057
One at a time. One at a time.

318
00:36:41,662 --> 00:36:45,542
Sir, please remember to remove all items
and your belt please. Thank you.

319
00:36:48,434 --> 00:36:52,609
Look, all I... I'm just looking for a...
place for a couple of nights

320
00:36:52,709 --> 00:36:55,409
'cause it's over 32 degrees outside.

321
00:36:55,509 --> 00:36:59,379
- Look... that's...
- Just a little while.

322
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,972
That's not what I'm asking.
Okay? I'm looking for your name.

323
00:37:04,072 --> 00:37:07,694
I wanna see if you've been already
assigned a shelter. Don't bust my balls.

324
00:37:07,794 --> 00:37:09,835
No, no, I'm sorry. I...

325
00:37:09,935 --> 00:37:12,960
Look, can I just get...
a bed for one night.

326
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:16,854
- Do you have any form of ID?
- No. I don't.

327
00:37:17,397 --> 00:37:21,335
Do you have anybody you can call? Anybody
you could stay with? A friend's couch?

328
00:37:21,435 --> 00:37:24,610
- I don't have... I don't have anyone.
- Nothing?

329
00:37:26,674 --> 00:37:29,589
Look, are you filled up or something?
Bec... is that...

330
00:37:29,689 --> 00:37:32,146
I could come back later
if it's... if that's better.

331
00:37:32,246 --> 00:37:34,142
- There's no later.
- No.

332
00:37:34,242 --> 00:37:36,267
The law says we have to give you a bed.

333
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:40,362
Yeah. Okay. Well, I could...

334
00:37:40,462 --> 00:37:43,257
Any place is fine. Anything you got.
I mean the floor is fine with me.

335
00:37:43,357 --> 00:37:47,695
I just need a blanket. A blanket
makes me sleep better. I like a blanket.

336
00:37:47,995 --> 00:37:50,923
- Okay, you'll stay here tonight in a bed.
- Okay. Good.

337
00:37:51,023 --> 00:37:55,574
We'll evaluate you. If you qualify,
you'll be assigned a permanent shelter.

338
00:37:56,436 --> 00:37:58,005
A what?

339
00:37:58,105 --> 00:38:01,675
- A place where you could stay.
- Permanent?

340
00:38:01,775 --> 00:38:04,583
It's up to you. We have all kinds.

341
00:38:08,915 --> 00:38:13,795
It's been a long time since I had a job.
It's been many years. I'm...

342
00:38:14,595 --> 00:38:18,336
I'm too old to be hired.
No one's gonna hire me like...

343
00:38:18,436 --> 00:38:23,730
not like I am. I'm just... I'm...
I'm really no good right now.

344
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,837
Well...

345
00:38:27,233 --> 00:38:28,876
Look at me, man.

346
00:38:29,236 --> 00:38:32,139
9/11 blew my brains out.
I had to crawl out of a ditch.

347
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:34,413
If you know what I mean.

348
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:40,425
I don't know what you mean.

349
00:38:41,215 --> 00:38:43,822
I was on your side of the glass once.

350
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,958
Yeah.

351
00:38:46,786 --> 00:38:48,889
So how much is it?

352
00:38:48,989 --> 00:38:51,325
- What?
- A bed, how much is a bed tonight?

353
00:38:51,425 --> 00:38:52,860
- For one night?
- No. Listen...

354
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,626
'Cause I don't have much.
I don't have... I don't have...

355
00:38:55,726 --> 00:38:59,099
Matter of fact I don't have anything.
I'm kind of in between...

356
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:01,081
Have a seat.

357
00:39:01,567 --> 00:39:02,519
Why?

358
00:39:02,619 --> 00:39:06,941
I'll kill you! I don't care! You can
give me the death penalty. I don't care!

359
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:10,744
What up, man? Look,
back up off me, back up off me!

360
00:39:10,844 --> 00:39:12,746
- You don't care about me!
- Are you okay?

361
00:39:12,846 --> 00:39:16,796
They sent me here. He says I gotta go back!
That's not fair! That's not fair!

362
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:20,221
You're not listening to me.
Listen to what I'm saying!

363
00:39:20,321 --> 00:39:23,791
Listen! He said that
I'm supposed to come here.

364
00:39:23,891 --> 00:39:26,545
They sent me here! They sent me...

365
00:39:26,645 --> 00:39:28,896
Back up! Back up off me, okay?

366
00:39:28,996 --> 00:39:31,858
- Listen to what I'm saying!
- I don't care! I'm out of here.

367
00:39:31,958 --> 00:39:34,668
He said if I go back,
I'm gonna kill you!

368
00:39:34,768 --> 00:39:37,462
Look, you're not listening to me.

369
00:39:37,562 --> 00:39:39,907
What are you doing?

370
00:39:40,007 --> 00:39:43,711
I can't do that. I'll kill him.
I swear I'll kill him.

371
00:39:43,811 --> 00:39:48,582
- I got diabetes. He don't care! He don't care!
- Can we get you somethin' to eat?

372
00:39:48,682 --> 00:39:52,119
He don't even got that.
He don't respect me.

373
00:39:52,219 --> 00:39:53,921
They sent me from...

374
00:39:54,021 --> 00:39:57,791
They said come here.
They said come here. He said go back.

375
00:39:57,891 --> 00:40:00,494
He said after one more night
I can come back here.

376
00:40:00,594 --> 00:40:02,930
- I got diabetes.
- Damn it. Fuck!

377
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:05,099
He's trying to kill me!

378
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:07,568
Where did you live last?

379
00:40:07,668 --> 00:40:10,771
I... I've been moving around
for a while.

380
00:40:10,871 --> 00:40:15,409
No, sweetie, where...
did you come from... before here?

381
00:40:15,509 --> 00:40:18,012
- Where was the last place you resided...
- Sheila's.

382
00:40:18,112 --> 00:40:21,025
Oh, Sheila. So where's Sheila?

383
00:40:22,915 --> 00:40:24,118
Queens? I don't know.

384
00:40:24,218 --> 00:40:27,588
- Could you go back there and stay...
- No, no, she was gone. She was evicted.

385
00:40:27,688 --> 00:40:31,024
She... she... she didn't say goodbye.

386
00:40:31,124 --> 00:40:33,594
She didn't take it to court.
She didn't do anything.

387
00:40:33,694 --> 00:40:35,729
Stupid cow. She knew
I had no place to go.

388
00:40:35,829 --> 00:40:39,800
Okay, so no staying with the cow.

389
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,507
How about family? You got a family?

390
00:40:47,873 --> 00:40:52,549
If I say I have a family
does that mean I can still stay here?

391
00:40:52,649 --> 00:40:56,788
Yes, unless they'd be willing
to take you in.

392
00:40:57,784 --> 00:41:00,469
- I don't have a family.
- Okay, come on, darling...

393
00:41:00,569 --> 00:41:04,116
You would much rather stay
with your family than stay here,

394
00:41:04,216 --> 00:41:05,759
you understand what I'm sayin'?

395
00:41:05,859 --> 00:41:09,334
Mr. Hammer, please,
trust me on that one.

396
00:41:09,762 --> 00:41:12,733
Hammond, Hammond, George Hammond.

397
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:16,837
- Sorry, darlin'. I'll change that one.
- I just want a bed to sleep on.

398
00:41:16,937 --> 00:41:21,242
I don't have enough money to stay
in a hotel. I don't have a family.

399
00:41:21,342 --> 00:41:25,283
You never married?
Handsome man like yourself.

400
00:41:28,382 --> 00:41:30,521
I'm not handsome.

401
00:41:31,284 --> 00:41:33,325
Maybe I was.

402
00:41:35,788 --> 00:41:38,025
I was married once.

403
00:41:38,325 --> 00:41:40,592
She's no longer with me.

404
00:41:41,761 --> 00:41:44,431
- Breasts.
- Excuse me?

405
00:41:44,531 --> 00:41:47,122
Breast. She had breast cancer.
One. Then the other one.

406
00:41:47,222 --> 00:41:49,703
She's... she died. She's gone.

407
00:41:49,803 --> 00:41:52,206
- Sorry about that.
- It's okay.

408
00:41:52,306 --> 00:41:55,561
It's alright. We had been
divorced for many years.

409
00:41:56,243 --> 00:41:59,765
How about children?
You got any children?

410
00:42:01,247 --> 00:42:03,015
One.

411
00:42:03,415 --> 00:42:04,471
One girl.

412
00:42:06,886 --> 00:42:10,357
Daughter. She know you're here?

413
00:42:11,382 --> 00:42:13,439
Give her a call?

414
00:42:13,861 --> 00:42:17,331
Yeah, daughters and daddy's
special relationship.

415
00:42:17,431 --> 00:42:20,584
I love my daddy, sure did.

416
00:42:20,684 --> 00:42:22,369
He was...

417
00:42:22,469 --> 00:42:26,673
I just worshiped the ground he walked on.
He could do no wrong in my eyes.

418
00:42:26,773 --> 00:42:28,575
He was a rock.

419
00:42:28,675 --> 00:42:33,285
I don't know where she is.
I... haven't seen her in a while.

420
00:42:34,681 --> 00:42:37,517
Anyway she doesn't want me.
She doesn't...

421
00:42:37,851 --> 00:42:41,535
She wouldn't want me. She's not one
of those daughters. She doesn't...

422
00:42:41,635 --> 00:42:47,499
adore me. She doesn't...
worship the ground I walk on. I...

423
00:42:50,029 --> 00:42:52,899
I didn't pay much attention to her.

424
00:42:52,999 --> 00:42:55,840
My mind was on somethin' else.

425
00:42:57,303 --> 00:43:00,337
On somethin' else? Like what?

426
00:43:06,812 --> 00:43:11,089
I'm just a fuck up. Probably always was.

427
00:43:12,718 --> 00:43:15,374
Alright. So...

428
00:43:15,474 --> 00:43:20,485
are you and have you been addicted
to any legal or illegal substances?

429
00:43:20,585 --> 00:43:22,867
And please don't lie.

430
00:43:24,397 --> 00:43:27,000
I just want a place to sleep, please.

431
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:30,566
- We will have to do a psychiatric evaluation.
- I just want a place to sleep...

432
00:43:30,666 --> 00:43:32,306
I'm addicted to sleep.

433
00:43:32,406 --> 00:43:38,445
And you will be evaluated
with the social history within...

434
00:43:38,545 --> 00:43:42,280
I'm gettin' the idea, I don't feel like
you want me to be here. Is that true?

435
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,751
'Cause I'm feelin' like
you want me to go away.

436
00:43:44,851 --> 00:43:48,389
- I want what's best for you.
- You want what's...

437
00:43:48,489 --> 00:43:53,126
You have no idea who I am. You don't
know me. How can you possibly...

438
00:43:53,226 --> 00:43:55,863
How are you gonna know
what's best for me?

439
00:43:55,963 --> 00:43:58,971
Why do you think I'm asking you
all these questions?

440
00:44:01,901 --> 00:44:04,137
Look, I am starving, I...

441
00:44:04,237 --> 00:44:07,875
I need to sleep. I have no answers.

442
00:44:07,975 --> 00:44:10,177
Put down anything you want,
I'm sure you know...

443
00:44:10,277 --> 00:44:12,212
- Do you see this?
- ...all the answers to everything.

444
00:44:12,312 --> 00:44:15,282
These are meal vouchers.

445
00:44:15,382 --> 00:44:18,151
Okay? Now, I can give you one of these.

446
00:44:18,251 --> 00:44:21,989
You get a meal,
let you back into the shelter.

447
00:44:22,089 --> 00:44:26,393
Missed dinner, but you're gonna have
breakfast tomorrow at 6 a.m.

448
00:44:26,493 --> 00:44:30,268
And if you're really good,
I might get you a sandwich.

449
00:44:31,697 --> 00:44:34,968
- Okay.
- But I need you to answer my questions.

450
00:44:35,068 --> 00:44:37,738
You willing to answer my questions?

451
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:40,373
Come on, handsome.

452
00:44:40,473 --> 00:44:42,689
Answer my questions.

453
00:44:46,746 --> 00:44:52,052
- What room were you assigned?
- To W... room 72.

454
00:44:52,152 --> 00:44:53,792
Up the stairs, to the right.

455
00:45:21,413 --> 00:45:23,355
Excuse me.

456
00:46:54,506 --> 00:46:56,643
Alright, wake up.

457
00:46:56,743 --> 00:46:59,517
Let's go, time to wake up.

458
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:34,612
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

459
00:49:00,532 --> 00:49:02,502
The world is not gonna help you!

460
00:49:02,602 --> 00:49:06,210
God will help you! God cares about you.

461
00:50:02,761 --> 00:50:04,697
No, no, no, they sent me from Bellevue.

462
00:50:04,797 --> 00:50:06,566
- You got any food on you, man?
- No, no, no.

463
00:50:06,666 --> 00:50:08,268
You bring any food in, you're out.

464
00:50:08,368 --> 00:50:11,107
No fighting, no spilling,
no stealing and no sex.

465
00:50:11,207 --> 00:50:14,174
Curfew's at 10:30.
Snooze, you lose your bed.

466
00:50:14,274 --> 00:50:16,408
Out by 8 a.m.

467
00:50:16,508 --> 00:50:18,278
Go upstairs.

468
00:50:18,378 --> 00:50:20,351
Hey, come here.

469
00:52:00,879 --> 00:52:04,425
- Hey, man, time's up.
- Sorry.

470
00:52:04,525 --> 00:52:07,854
White ass, there ain't
no time limit on showers.

471
00:52:07,954 --> 00:52:09,789
What are you?
You the water authority all of a sudden?

472
00:52:09,889 --> 00:52:13,230
Hey, I'm sick and tired
of waiting, okay?

473
00:52:13,492 --> 00:52:15,795
Yo, man, you ain't got to lie...

474
00:52:15,895 --> 00:52:20,238
I don't know him. I don't know.
Mind your own business.

475
00:52:32,244 --> 00:52:34,981
- What?
- It's my bed.

476
00:52:35,081 --> 00:52:38,018
- No, it's not...
- It's my bed, it's my bed.

477
00:52:38,118 --> 00:52:41,709
They gave it to me.
I just got here. Okay?

478
00:52:56,034 --> 00:52:58,042
I'm Jack.

479
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:07,084
It's nice to meet you too.

480
00:53:08,113 --> 00:53:10,867
What's the matter?
You afraid of me, newbie?

481
00:53:11,483 --> 00:53:13,825
You afraid of me, newbie?

482
00:53:15,154 --> 00:53:17,662
Afraid I'll take your things?

483
00:53:19,058 --> 00:53:21,893
Afraid I'd fuck you up or something?

484
00:53:23,662 --> 00:53:26,133
Why would I fuck with you?

485
00:53:26,633 --> 00:53:30,348
No, you fuck up, you go
to next step shelter which is...

486
00:53:30,448 --> 00:53:34,400
you know, last step shelter really and then
you're up shit creek without a paddle.

487
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:36,109
And they can kick you out for a year.

488
00:53:36,209 --> 00:53:38,611
They can't deny you a bed
if you don't fuck up.

489
00:53:38,711 --> 00:53:42,820
So you gotta learn to play their game.
That's why I play it cool.

490
00:53:44,616 --> 00:53:48,521
- I know you are not sleeping.
- What the hell is this?

491
00:53:48,621 --> 00:53:51,291
An Aryan nation brotherhood meeting?

492
00:53:51,391 --> 00:53:54,644
They don't give a shit
who they let in these days.

493
00:53:54,744 --> 00:53:57,030
Why don't you pull up your pants?

494
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:59,550
Why don't you go to hell?

495
00:54:01,768 --> 00:54:04,019
- What'd he mean by that?
- I thought you were asleep.

496
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:06,005
- I am asleep. I was...
- Oh, you're asleep?

497
00:54:06,105 --> 00:54:08,074
Why did he say that?

498
00:54:08,174 --> 00:54:12,083
Oh, he's a fucking racist. That's why.

499
00:54:12,778 --> 00:54:15,286
Stop payin' attention to him.

500
00:54:19,084 --> 00:54:21,887
We got white people in this system.

501
00:54:21,987 --> 00:54:23,990
More than you think.

502
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:27,365
Yeah, not more than them, but...

503
00:54:27,826 --> 00:54:30,296
Yeah, there's more of us on the street.

504
00:54:30,396 --> 00:54:33,204
That's the pride of the white man.

505
00:54:36,935 --> 00:54:39,443
Shelters are like prisons.

506
00:54:39,971 --> 00:54:42,774
You know, just a fucking rat in a cage.

507
00:54:42,874 --> 00:54:45,183
This place is shit.

508
00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:49,687
It's designed to be shit.

509
00:54:50,115 --> 00:54:52,423
You read the Bible?

510
00:54:53,718 --> 00:54:58,557
I read the Bible. "That which is crooked
cannot be made straight."

511
00:54:58,657 --> 00:55:01,165
So now, here we are.

512
00:55:01,727 --> 00:55:04,076
Anyway, I don't care.

513
00:55:05,397 --> 00:55:09,643
I don't care. They don't have
any power over me. You know.

514
00:55:12,671 --> 00:55:15,485
I gotta go to bed.
I got work in the morning.

515
00:55:19,278 --> 00:55:22,119
You got a job? Work?

516
00:55:23,248 --> 00:55:25,554
Yeah, I got a job.

517
00:55:27,486 --> 00:55:28,857
Just because I sleep in this fucking bed

518
00:55:28,957 --> 00:55:32,458
doesn't mean I'm like some
fucking lowlife scumbag

519
00:55:32,558 --> 00:55:35,051
begging for change on the street.

520
00:56:15,534 --> 00:56:17,341
Damn.

521
00:56:54,606 --> 00:56:56,847
Just one moment.

522
00:57:04,983 --> 00:57:06,490
Okay.

523
00:57:07,319 --> 00:57:10,063
Now... let's see.

524
00:57:10,390 --> 00:57:14,093
Can you... can you tell me something?
Is there a way to get some money here?

525
00:57:14,193 --> 00:57:17,530
Oh, yeah. You get a job.

526
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:21,168
Or get on welfare
or Social Security or disability

527
00:57:21,268 --> 00:57:25,306
or food stamps or...

528
00:57:26,206 --> 00:57:31,043
The purpose of this evaluation is to see
what kinda services you're eligible for.

529
00:57:31,143 --> 00:57:32,947
You know...

530
00:57:33,047 --> 00:57:36,297
psychiatric, substance abuse...

531
00:57:36,397 --> 00:57:38,733
whatever or what not.

532
00:57:39,619 --> 00:57:41,925
Do you understand what I'm saying?

533
00:57:46,958 --> 00:57:48,799
Are you alright?

534
00:57:48,899 --> 00:57:50,781
I'm lost.

535
00:57:50,881 --> 00:57:53,329
You're here because I'm gonna
evaluate you so I can help you out,

536
00:57:53,429 --> 00:57:56,414
so I can see what services I can get you.
How I can take care of you.

537
00:57:56,514 --> 00:58:00,206
I'm sorry, one second.
Let me just take care of this. Shit.

538
00:58:00,306 --> 00:58:01,974
Sorry.

539
00:58:02,074 --> 00:58:05,628
Shit. Boyfriend troubles.
You know what I'm saying?

540
00:58:05,728 --> 00:58:07,280
- Have a nice day...
- Have a nice day?

541
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:11,489
You have a fucked up day! You ain't
got no right to talk to me this way.

542
00:58:12,017 --> 00:58:15,588
I live here! I live here
like everybody else does.

543
00:58:15,688 --> 00:58:19,092
You ain't got no right to say this thing
to me. Treat me the way you do.

544
00:58:19,192 --> 00:58:23,896
Act like I'm gonna rat on these boys here.
These men are my brothers.

545
00:58:23,996 --> 00:58:27,834
You don't know that shit?
You don't live here with us, that's why.

546
00:58:27,934 --> 00:58:29,769
If you know what to say,
you don't know shit.

547
00:58:29,869 --> 00:58:31,671
- Don't matter what you say to me.
- You don't know shit.

548
00:58:31,771 --> 00:58:33,993
- You gotta learn how to talk to me.
- I gotta learn how to talk...

549
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:37,410
- You got to learn to act! You hear me?
- Take care, Mr. Turner.

550
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:41,581
Take care? You got your nerve, man.
You got your goddamn nerve.

551
00:58:41,681 --> 00:58:44,384
You give me some cigarette,
you think I'm gonna rat on people.

552
00:58:44,484 --> 00:58:46,552
These are my people.
These are my brothers.

553
00:58:46,652 --> 00:58:50,556
You sit up there, try to be like
the grand master of this here place.

554
00:58:50,656 --> 00:58:52,908
You ain't shit, Mike.

555
00:59:06,605 --> 00:59:10,209
What do you want? Do you want something?

556
00:59:10,729 --> 00:59:12,741
You're the new guy. Dixon Turner.

557
00:59:12,841 --> 00:59:14,858
- Attorney at law. I want to represent you.
- I don't have anything.

558
00:59:14,958 --> 00:59:18,685
- I don't know what you want from me?
- I'm just kidding. I'm a jazz man.

559
00:59:18,785 --> 00:59:21,754
You know, I'm a musician.
I play... I play good too.

560
00:59:21,854 --> 00:59:25,412
- Yeah. Yeah. Where you going?
- I'm go... I'm going.

561
00:59:25,512 --> 00:59:28,561
Oh, I'll walk with you. Come on.
Come on, I'll walk with you.

562
00:59:28,961 --> 00:59:31,768
Done much walking
since you been reduced?

563
00:59:32,543 --> 00:59:35,359
- I'm not reduced.
- Yeah, you reduced. Refined.

564
00:59:35,459 --> 00:59:38,838
- Relocated. Remitted. Replaced.
- I don't know what that means. I'm not reduced.

565
00:59:38,938 --> 00:59:40,707
Whatever they call homeless,
that's what you are.

566
00:59:40,807 --> 00:59:43,847
- I'm not homeless either.
- Yeah, you're homeless.

567
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:27,477
What... what number are we?

568
01:00:27,577 --> 01:00:29,908
What number we got?

569
01:00:30,008 --> 01:00:31,900
Yeah.

570
01:00:36,861 --> 01:00:39,632
Listen, listen, George,
you got any children?

571
01:00:39,864 --> 01:00:42,072
I got 2 sons...

572
01:00:42,433 --> 01:00:44,103
so they tell me.

573
01:00:44,203 --> 01:00:47,678
Army, marines. Good boys. Good boys.

574
01:00:47,806 --> 01:00:52,240
And I got a daughter...
though she didn't make it.

575
01:00:52,977 --> 01:00:56,019
Human Im... Immuno...

576
01:00:57,248 --> 01:00:59,284
Immuno...

577
01:00:59,384 --> 01:01:02,221
You know, HIV... took her.

578
01:01:02,321 --> 01:01:04,895
Baby didn't stand a chance.

579
01:01:05,089 --> 01:01:09,896
And I got another daughter.
They say between 1975 and 1976.

580
01:01:09,996 --> 01:01:14,033
But you know how it is being a musician
on the road makin' music.

581
01:01:14,133 --> 01:01:17,601
White powder. Cocaine, heroin.

582
01:01:17,701 --> 01:01:20,006
And a few other things too.

583
01:01:20,106 --> 01:01:23,793
Ended up right where you thought
you'd never be but here I am.

584
01:01:23,893 --> 01:01:27,146
Here I am. So, hey, hey, listen to this.

585
01:01:27,246 --> 01:01:32,118
Well, do you know that every...
human male...

586
01:01:32,218 --> 01:01:34,554
That's a man, like you and me.

587
01:01:34,654 --> 01:01:40,292
Makes enough sperm in 2 weeks to impregnate
every ovulating woman on this planet?

588
01:01:40,392 --> 01:01:44,196
That's a fact, man.
I heard it once from this doctor

589
01:01:44,296 --> 01:01:46,599
I was hanging out with...
on the streets.

590
01:01:46,699 --> 01:01:50,430
He was a meth head. You know, tweaker.

591
01:01:51,904 --> 01:01:54,807
He worked at Harlem
and did these tests...

592
01:01:54,907 --> 01:01:59,093
tuberculosis tests at the Harlem Hospital.
You know, he let them inject him...

593
01:02:00,779 --> 01:02:03,854
for McDonald coupons.
Can you believe that?

594
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:08,591
But he... he dead now.

595
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,723
So I don't see him anymore.

596
01:02:11,823 --> 01:02:15,959
He was killed by this transvestite
he was seein' on and off.

597
01:02:16,059 --> 01:02:19,236
More often on, if you know
what I'm talkin' about.

598
01:02:24,068 --> 01:02:29,130
A real doctor with a real MD
until he lost his license.

599
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:32,115
He was a brain... brain man.

600
01:02:36,381 --> 01:02:38,618
Every 2 weeks.

601
01:02:38,718 --> 01:02:41,992
Every fertile female on the planet.

602
01:02:43,922 --> 01:02:47,159
You know, the only thing I do
for pleasure these days

603
01:02:47,259 --> 01:02:49,866
is have myself a Coca Cola.

604
01:02:50,395 --> 01:02:53,064
Coca Cola is my only...

605
01:02:53,164 --> 01:02:54,766
Yeah.

606
01:02:54,866 --> 01:02:57,073
Sometimes, Pepsi.

607
01:03:00,205 --> 01:03:03,175
Hey, you know what,
I played for Bill Evans once.

608
01:03:03,275 --> 01:03:05,978
You know who it is, don't you?
Bill Evans, jazz man.

609
01:03:06,078 --> 01:03:09,882
I played for him once
about 10 blocks from here.

610
01:03:09,982 --> 01:03:12,851
He said, I played okay.

611
01:03:12,951 --> 01:03:17,189
Can you believe that? That's like
Michelangelo sayin', he sayin'...

612
01:03:17,289 --> 01:03:20,764
he admires your paint job
on the ceilin'.

613
01:03:21,059 --> 01:03:24,630
I played okay. Bill Evans.

614
01:03:24,730 --> 01:03:26,603
Shit.

615
01:03:31,336 --> 01:03:33,776
Damn, we're gonna be here all day.

616
01:03:46,318 --> 01:03:50,026
Okay, do you have any I.D. that proves
that you're a citizen of the United States?

617
01:03:50,154 --> 01:03:54,726
What? No. Not on my person.
I don't have it, no. No, I'm sorry.

618
01:03:54,826 --> 01:03:57,801
It's okay. Look, can you get it
and come back?

619
01:03:58,563 --> 01:04:00,432
I don't know where it is.

620
01:04:00,532 --> 01:04:03,106
Alright, what's your
social security number?

621
01:04:04,468 --> 01:04:06,877
Okay, okay.

622
01:04:08,439 --> 01:04:09,642
- 930...
- No.

623
01:04:09,742 --> 01:04:11,777
- 05...
- Sir, that's not right.

624
01:04:11,877 --> 01:04:13,846
I think.

625
01:04:14,146 --> 01:04:16,282
- 930?
- 9... no.

626
01:04:16,382 --> 01:04:18,217
- 93005...
- It's not correct.

627
01:04:18,317 --> 01:04:20,452
The first digit can't be 9, sir.

628
01:04:20,552 --> 01:04:21,654
- 093?
- Oh, boy.

629
01:04:21,754 --> 01:04:25,491
093051120.

630
01:04:25,591 --> 01:04:29,566
I think. I... 093?

631
01:04:29,994 --> 01:04:32,765
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I can't.

632
01:04:32,865 --> 01:04:37,510
I can't remember. I have a hard time
with numbers. I... I have...

633
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:41,173
- remembering problems sometimes...
- That's okay. It's okay, it's okay.

634
01:04:41,273 --> 01:04:43,542
We need some documentation, anyway.

635
01:04:43,642 --> 01:04:46,317
You must get a new social security card.

636
01:04:47,845 --> 01:04:49,548
Where do I get that?

637
01:04:49,648 --> 01:04:53,018
$3000 per person per month

638
01:04:53,118 --> 01:04:56,200
per person staying in the shelter.

639
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:58,390
I say, Mr. Commissioner of Housing.

640
01:04:58,490 --> 01:05:01,636
Mr. Housing Commissioner
give me $800 rent,

641
01:05:01,736 --> 01:05:04,096
and you can spend the rest
on pussy for all I care.

642
01:05:04,196 --> 01:05:08,367
Get you a lot of pussy with that kind of
money. Give me a little bit of self-respect.

643
01:05:08,467 --> 01:05:12,104
That's what I want. That's all I want.
A place I can call my own.

644
01:05:12,204 --> 01:05:16,742
Give me a nice place.
Give me some bleach. I'll clean it up.

645
01:05:16,842 --> 01:05:20,045
I'll clean up real neat,
and respectable-like.

646
01:05:20,145 --> 01:05:24,681
Have some of my musician friends
over there. Get us some jazz.

647
01:05:27,919 --> 01:05:30,288
You wanna get cleaned up?

648
01:05:30,388 --> 01:05:31,957
A shower?

649
01:05:32,057 --> 01:05:34,693
I know this lady up in the Bronx.

650
01:05:34,793 --> 01:05:39,329
Opens her apartment up, and you can take
a shower but it's gonna cost you.

651
01:05:43,668 --> 01:05:47,473
The shelter's free. The choice is yours.

652
01:05:47,573 --> 01:05:51,214
Would you rather go up there,
or the shelter?

653
01:05:52,143 --> 01:05:53,545
You hear?

654
01:05:53,645 --> 01:05:56,319
- I'm done.
- Done?

655
01:06:07,025 --> 01:06:10,229
That dude missed curfew.
You miss curfew, you're fucked.

656
01:06:10,329 --> 01:06:12,331
They make you sit out in hallways.

657
01:06:12,431 --> 01:06:14,866
They give your bed away
to somebody else.

658
01:06:14,966 --> 01:06:19,005
And your locker. It's your locker,
so you can lock it up.

659
01:06:19,105 --> 01:06:21,340
But here's the thing,
you come back the next night

660
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,457
they make you sit in the hallway
till after midnight then maybe...

661
01:06:24,557 --> 01:06:26,312
just maybe, you get a bed.

662
01:06:26,412 --> 01:06:30,765
They call that packing up,
know what I mean. Packin' up.

663
01:06:31,616 --> 01:06:35,558
It takes you seven days
to get your... get your locker back.

664
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:38,557
And now some of the case workers,
they really care.

665
01:06:38,657 --> 01:06:40,926
They're good people,
they're trying to get us housing

666
01:06:41,026 --> 01:06:45,263
but there's no housing out there
to be had so they become desensitized.

667
01:06:45,363 --> 01:06:49,506
Too many of us, you know.
Too many of us.

668
01:06:50,368 --> 01:06:52,638
Think about it from a taxpayer's
point of view.

669
01:06:52,738 --> 01:06:55,307
We get a mattress, a bed, a locker.

670
01:06:55,407 --> 01:06:58,678
Shampoo, toothpaste.
It ain't right. It ain't a square deal.

671
01:06:58,778 --> 01:07:01,080
We didn't earn it.
It's a handout, not a hand-up.

672
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:03,242
- Turner, leave that man alone.
- Oh, shit.

673
01:07:03,342 --> 01:07:05,387
He bothering you?

674
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:09,392
- No, not at all.
- He said no, not at all.

675
01:07:10,488 --> 01:07:13,091
Go back to bed and stop
hanging out down here.

676
01:07:13,191 --> 01:07:15,498
Go back to bed?

677
01:07:16,194 --> 01:07:20,399
You need to kiss my ass. Go back to bed.
Treat me like some goddamned child.

678
01:07:20,499 --> 01:07:23,339
You... you need to watch yourself.

679
01:07:24,235 --> 01:07:28,544
You're the child around here.
Go back to your bed.

680
01:07:30,208 --> 01:07:33,450
Hey. Hey.

681
01:07:33,678 --> 01:07:35,752
He bothering you?

682
01:07:40,084 --> 01:07:42,287
No. Not at all.

683
01:07:42,387 --> 01:07:44,661
Well, if you need me, just call.

684
01:07:53,232 --> 01:07:55,367
You know, you just gotta
get there really early.

685
01:07:55,467 --> 01:07:58,571
You guys are just, you know,
you're not getting there early enough.

686
01:07:58,671 --> 01:08:01,273
Yeah, but it's raining, you know.
I don't wanna get wet.

687
01:08:01,373 --> 01:08:04,310
But it's not raining today,
which is good.

688
01:08:04,610 --> 01:08:07,755
Alright, I'm gonna go. Thanks, you guys.
I'll see you later, okay.

689
01:08:07,855 --> 01:08:09,648
- Yeah.
- You know...

690
01:08:09,748 --> 01:08:13,052
some days, this feels heavy... you know.

691
01:08:13,552 --> 01:08:17,489
You guys have a good day.
Have a good night too.

692
01:08:17,589 --> 01:08:19,258
- Sheila?
- Who?

693
01:08:19,358 --> 01:08:21,193
- Sheila!
- That's not my name.

694
01:08:21,293 --> 01:08:23,495
Sheila! What do you mean? It's me.

695
01:08:23,595 --> 01:08:26,866
- That's not my name.
- But... you're Shelia. I'm George.

696
01:08:26,966 --> 01:08:32,046
- This is George. I don't know what...
- George, I don't know who the fuck you are.

697
01:08:32,146 --> 01:08:35,488
- Please don't talk to me. Don't talk to me.
- I lost my friend. I lost my friend.

698
01:08:35,588 --> 01:08:37,776
And then I stopped looking for him,
I didn't know anyone but you.

699
01:08:37,876 --> 01:08:42,014
Wait, wait, wait wait, wait, wait.
Look, I was just gonna get some beer.

700
01:08:42,114 --> 01:08:44,120
You have money?

701
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:48,157
I got enough for a six pack.
You want some?

702
01:08:48,786 --> 01:08:51,361
Do I get to keep the cans?

703
01:08:53,137 --> 01:08:56,528
I know how to make enough
to get through, you know.

704
01:08:56,628 --> 01:08:59,898
Cannin' works for basic
daily needs, basically.

705
01:08:59,998 --> 01:09:02,851
And if I'm up at 5 in the morning,
I can be done

706
01:09:02,951 --> 01:09:06,876
before the midtown worker bees
even finish breakfast.

707
01:09:08,006 --> 01:09:11,524
Also, cans that pile up
from the night before.

708
01:09:26,223 --> 01:09:30,628
Anyone, you know. Cops, other homeless.

709
01:09:30,728 --> 01:09:33,269
Teachers from Colombia.

710
01:09:33,631 --> 01:09:37,237
Hasidim. No one's above it.

711
01:09:38,469 --> 01:09:41,139
I started that when I was a kid.

712
01:09:41,239 --> 01:09:46,667
I slept with a few guys but that was just
so I could get away from my stepdad.

713
01:09:50,848 --> 01:09:52,755
Stepdad...

714
01:09:53,718 --> 01:09:57,293
You know what they say, incest is best.

715
01:10:01,425 --> 01:10:04,464
Not really, not really.

716
01:10:07,331 --> 01:10:12,137
I... I thought I could go to Vegas...

717
01:10:12,237 --> 01:10:16,712
and do something with the cards
because I was good at countin'.

718
01:10:16,907 --> 01:10:19,449
Is that stupid or what?

719
01:10:20,778 --> 01:10:22,781
But you know what,
I lost my taste for hooking

720
01:10:22,881 --> 01:10:26,185
after Joseph beat the shit
out of me that last time

721
01:10:26,285 --> 01:10:29,525
because I wouldn't let
his johns tie me up.

722
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:32,623
That's where I draw the line.

723
01:10:32,723 --> 01:10:34,631
I gotta be in charge.

724
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:38,931
You gotta get along
to get along, you know?

725
01:10:39,031 --> 01:10:42,099
You... your real friends
will look out for you.

726
01:10:42,199 --> 01:10:44,435
On the street, that is.

727
01:10:44,535 --> 01:10:48,880
I am done with the shelters. I am done.

728
01:10:49,707 --> 01:10:51,481
You...

729
01:10:52,710 --> 01:10:54,513
Why...

730
01:10:54,813 --> 01:10:57,221
Why are you looking at me like that?

731
01:11:13,263 --> 01:11:15,104
Sheila.

732
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:18,140
You awake?

733
01:11:21,939 --> 01:11:23,088
That was nice.

734
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:52,101
You're insane.

735
01:12:56,266 --> 01:13:00,009
Will you move? Excuse me, thank you.

736
01:13:00,638 --> 01:13:03,646
Why would you just give me
those photos like that?

737
01:13:05,142 --> 01:13:07,045
I didn't have
any other place to put 'em.

738
01:13:07,145 --> 01:13:10,115
I'm... I'm between places right now.

739
01:13:10,615 --> 01:13:13,252
- Sheila's gone.
- Don't talk. I don't wanna hear it.

740
01:13:13,352 --> 01:13:16,587
Actually, I don't need to know
anything about your life.

741
01:13:16,687 --> 01:13:18,928
So, what is it you want?

742
01:13:24,695 --> 01:13:26,864
You want money?

743
01:13:26,964 --> 01:13:30,239
Is that it? Alright, well.

744
01:13:30,634 --> 01:13:34,010
Here. All I have.

745
01:13:40,678 --> 01:13:44,088
- Yeah, I don't need all of it.
- What else?

746
01:13:50,521 --> 01:13:52,958
You seem good. You seem pretty good.

747
01:13:53,058 --> 01:13:56,228
- What else do you want because I'm busy.
- I want... how much is it...

748
01:13:56,328 --> 01:14:02,505
And I don't wanna get involved in any
of your fucked up shit ever again.

749
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,040
I don't.

750
01:14:07,972 --> 01:14:10,640
Alright. Thank you.

751
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:13,916
Just stop feeling so sorry for yourself.

752
01:14:26,457 --> 01:14:29,699
I'm probably gonna move away, Dad.
Like, far away.

753
01:14:31,095 --> 01:14:34,915
Then you won't be able to find me.
So, you should just say goodbye now.

754
01:14:36,533 --> 01:14:38,808
Are you really moving?

755
01:14:42,406 --> 01:14:44,708
Alright, whatever.

756
01:14:44,808 --> 01:14:48,185
I'm busy, alright? Sorry.

757
01:16:01,018 --> 01:16:04,121
Hey, fuckhead. Stop that!

758
01:16:04,221 --> 01:16:07,325
Hey, fuck, I said stop that.

759
01:16:07,425 --> 01:16:11,100
Hey, get the fuck outta here.
You fucking animal.

760
01:16:11,930 --> 01:16:14,236
I said get the fuck outta here.

761
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,374
I oughta get you arrested.

762
01:16:31,749 --> 01:16:35,838
That's their only objective
is to make you and I feel like...

763
01:16:36,187 --> 01:16:38,923
What the fuck? Where you been, man?

764
01:16:39,023 --> 01:16:42,093
Where you been? You lucky motherfucker.

765
01:16:42,193 --> 01:16:45,030
You stay out all night,
and they don't give your bed away.

766
01:16:45,130 --> 01:16:47,165
Like you're untouchable.

767
01:16:47,265 --> 01:16:50,608
It's like there's no punishing
King George around here.

768
01:16:51,169 --> 01:16:55,005
So, where you been? What did you do?

769
01:16:55,105 --> 01:16:57,041
Where did you go?

770
01:16:57,141 --> 01:17:00,644
Did you go dancing? That's what you did?

771
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:04,587
Oh, a fight!

772
01:17:13,457 --> 01:17:16,928
- What happened to the other guy, do you know?
- They sent him to another shelter.

773
01:17:17,028 --> 01:17:22,046
Lucky bastard.
Qualifies for all sorts of shit now.

774
01:17:22,566 --> 01:17:26,043
I told 'em you weren't right in the head
and you needed somebody to look after you.

775
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:28,577
- You're okay with that, right?
- Yeah, I'm not right in the head.

776
01:17:28,677 --> 01:17:29,974
Yeah.

777
01:17:30,074 --> 01:17:33,881
You know...
I've got this cousin in Kenya.

778
01:17:34,344 --> 01:17:40,336
Has a big factory there. The turbines,
cotton or some shit like that, sugar.

779
01:17:40,436 --> 01:17:42,786
Said he'd give me a real cushy job.

780
01:17:42,886 --> 01:17:45,223
The city says, if I sign a paper

781
01:17:45,323 --> 01:17:47,926
sayin' that I wouldn't come back
to the New York shelter

782
01:17:48,026 --> 01:17:50,666
they will buy me a ticket.
Send me there.

783
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:53,006
Free of charge. That's right.
You believe that?

784
01:17:53,106 --> 01:17:56,074
- No, I don't...
- Buy me a ticket to go all the way there.

785
01:17:57,068 --> 01:17:59,308
But I can't go.

786
01:18:00,404 --> 01:18:04,506
- I can't leave Russell.
- Gentlemen, lights out. 10 minutes.

787
01:18:05,042 --> 01:18:07,045
- Who's Russell?
- My dog.

788
01:18:07,145 --> 01:18:09,954
- A dog?
- He's my main man.

789
01:18:11,681 --> 01:18:13,722
Where is he?

790
01:18:19,456 --> 01:18:21,664
I don't know.

791
01:18:25,128 --> 01:18:28,967
But if you got a family
they'll take you in.

792
01:18:29,367 --> 01:18:34,673
They'll fly you there. Free of charge.
It's a sweet deal thing.

793
01:18:34,773 --> 01:18:37,442
They're gonna want to, you see
'cause they want you out of here.

794
01:18:37,542 --> 01:18:39,749
Out of this hell hole.

795
01:18:40,678 --> 01:18:43,568
I'd be in China right now
if it wasn't for Russell.

796
01:18:47,618 --> 01:18:50,092
Hey, look at this. Look at me.

797
01:18:51,455 --> 01:18:53,529
See that there?

798
01:18:53,924 --> 01:18:57,228
See that? Can you read that?
That's the Lord's prayer.

799
01:18:57,328 --> 01:19:00,899
An Aramaic. Galilean, that's the...
That's the Jesus...

800
01:19:00,999 --> 01:19:02,916
- Damn!
- That's right.

801
01:19:03,016 --> 01:19:04,903
Be my back, I got your back.

802
01:19:05,003 --> 01:19:08,707
Now, you see that little round thing there.
That's the... that's the all-seeing eye.

803
01:19:08,807 --> 01:19:12,150
See everything. I got your back.

804
01:19:13,111 --> 01:19:16,986
There's nothing to worry about.
Dix is on the case.

805
01:19:19,349 --> 01:19:21,123
Yeah.

806
01:19:33,230 --> 01:19:35,300
You're gonna need
to bring in your birth certificate

807
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:39,170
if you wanna get a new social security card.
Okay, you're gonna have to find one.

808
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:42,247
You're gonna have to get
something equivalent to it.

809
01:19:42,347 --> 01:19:45,006
Now, he does not need
a birth certificate. The man is here.

810
01:19:45,106 --> 01:19:49,147
- You see him standing here. His...
- When you get your paperwork together

811
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:51,654
then please bring it back,
and I'll try to help you.

812
01:19:51,754 --> 01:19:55,586
Excuse me, ma'am. I like that hair.
You got any change for me?

813
01:19:55,686 --> 01:20:00,429
A dime or somethin'?
My credit card, it's all maxed out.

814
01:20:02,592 --> 01:20:03,962
Yeah.

815
01:20:04,462 --> 01:20:08,800
Bless you. Bless you, man.
May you prosper. May you prosper.

816
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:11,136
Excuse me... Sue, Sue, Sue.

817
01:20:11,436 --> 01:20:14,940
Hey, Sue, you got some change?
No change?

818
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:17,676
Muscular dude.
Look at 'em walking there.

819
01:20:17,776 --> 01:20:20,382
Like Samson. Boom, boom.

820
01:20:26,250 --> 01:20:27,979
- I don't have that. I'm sorry.
- It can be anything.

821
01:20:28,079 --> 01:20:30,209
- Anything like what? What...
- A driver's license?

822
01:20:30,309 --> 01:20:33,424
- No.
- A state issued non-driver photo ID card?

823
01:20:33,524 --> 01:20:35,531
- No.
- A passport?

824
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:38,596
- I had one once. No!
- US military photo ID card?

825
01:20:38,696 --> 01:20:40,298
I wasn't in the military. No.

826
01:20:40,398 --> 01:20:43,668
It can be 2 recent utility bills
with your name and address.

827
01:20:43,768 --> 01:20:47,105
- I don't have an address. I'm sorry...
- Telephone? Con Ed? Cable?

828
01:20:47,205 --> 01:20:49,040
He does not have a home.

829
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:51,810
At the moment, I don't have
a home, at the moment...

830
01:20:51,910 --> 01:20:56,748
Then you can get a letter from a government
agency dated within the last 6 months.

831
01:20:56,848 --> 01:20:59,017
Taxes, social security.

832
01:20:59,117 --> 01:21:02,154
Do you think we'd be here
if he had that shit?

833
01:21:02,254 --> 01:21:05,357
You need a valid photo ID
for a copy of your birth certificate.

834
01:21:05,457 --> 01:21:08,127
- Okay, yeah, I understand.
- Then come back. Thank you, gentlemen.

835
01:21:08,727 --> 01:21:11,997
He fell on the tracks.
He was all diced and sliced up.

836
01:21:12,097 --> 01:21:14,733
You know, it was interesting
'cause he lived in the subway.

837
01:21:14,833 --> 01:21:16,234
On the E train, which is small.

838
01:21:16,334 --> 01:21:19,053
Because the E train stays underground.
They don't come up above ground.

839
01:21:19,153 --> 01:21:22,874
$60,000 in his shoes, in his sock.

840
01:21:22,974 --> 01:21:26,444
He... you don't get it.
The man didn't have to be who he was.

841
01:21:26,544 --> 01:21:29,748
He wasn't a bum. He had all
the help he needed in his feet.

842
01:21:29,848 --> 01:21:33,184
He didn't have to be homeless.
The disease told him he was homeless.

843
01:21:33,284 --> 01:21:36,321
The disease told him
that he wasn't worth anything.

844
01:21:36,421 --> 01:21:40,057
Would you say something? Anything!

845
01:21:40,157 --> 01:21:42,564
Did you hear what I was just saying?

846
01:21:45,595 --> 01:21:48,299
- Are you the idiot or am I?
- Am I what?

847
01:21:48,399 --> 01:21:50,168
Because it's what
I've been thinking about.

848
01:21:50,268 --> 01:21:53,605
- I've been feeling for the last...
- Yeah?

849
01:21:53,705 --> 01:21:56,441
10 years maybe that I am...

850
01:21:56,541 --> 01:21:59,648
just one stupid, fucking...

851
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:02,451
loser of an idiot.

852
01:22:03,113 --> 01:22:04,849
And I'd...

853
01:22:04,949 --> 01:22:07,923
- You know...
- I'm just not so sure anymore.

854
01:22:08,785 --> 01:22:10,789
- Am I homeless?
- No, no, no, you just need...

855
01:22:10,889 --> 01:22:13,424
- Am I homeless?
- You're reduced, on your way up, George.

856
01:22:13,524 --> 01:22:15,641
I'm homeless. I don't have a home.
I got no home.

857
01:22:15,741 --> 01:22:19,982
- No, no, that's not what this is about.
- I'm homeless. I'm nobody. I don't exist.

858
01:22:20,082 --> 01:22:22,233
- We're reduced...
- You don't exist. We do no exist.

859
01:22:22,333 --> 01:22:26,675
- What do you mean, we don't exist?
- Fucking... we don't exist.

860
01:22:27,070 --> 01:22:29,140
Maybe you don't exist. I exist.

861
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:34,245
- I'm gonna prove to you that you...
- They think you're a fucking clown.

862
01:22:34,345 --> 01:22:38,115
You're a clown. They think we're clowns.
We're cartoons.

863
01:22:38,215 --> 01:22:40,619
- I'm a clown now?
- You and me are cartoons.

864
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:43,855
Okay, I'm... okay, I'm a cartoon.
I'm a little cartoon.

865
01:22:43,955 --> 01:22:46,015
I will do some animated...

866
01:22:46,115 --> 01:22:48,860
- A cartoon. I am a cartoon.
- I'm animated. I know who I am.

867
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,795
Alright, look at me. I am a cartoon.

868
01:22:53,197 --> 01:22:55,633
Hey, hey, you okay in there?

869
01:22:55,733 --> 01:22:58,140
Yeah. Oh, okay.

870
01:23:02,173 --> 01:23:06,916
Hey, hey. Wash your hands.
Wash your hands.

871
01:23:09,346 --> 01:23:12,050
You should be working.
You should get your own place.

872
01:23:12,150 --> 01:23:15,987
But you don't. Why? Why? Why is that?
'Cause you're sick in the head.

873
01:23:16,087 --> 01:23:18,556
You're not well.
You got no support system.

874
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:20,625
I mean, you... you got old,

875
01:23:20,725 --> 01:23:25,063
and, you know,
you love this sauce too much.

876
01:23:25,163 --> 01:23:28,766
You don't like yourself. You're depressed.
You don't believe in yourself.

877
01:23:28,866 --> 01:23:31,821
So what's society supposed to do
with you? Why should they care?

878
01:23:31,921 --> 01:23:34,705
- It's all your fault...
- If you keep talking like this about me

879
01:23:34,805 --> 01:23:37,306
I am going to hurt you.
Do you understand that?

880
01:23:37,406 --> 01:23:39,710
I will hurt you, I swear.

881
01:23:39,810 --> 01:23:42,217
I'm not talking about you.

882
01:23:42,846 --> 01:23:44,615
I'm talking about myself.

883
01:23:44,715 --> 01:23:48,690
Do you guys... do you guys want something
like rice and vegetables or something.

884
01:23:50,054 --> 01:23:52,323
- Yeah, thank you.
- Give me one minute, alright?

885
01:23:52,423 --> 01:23:54,863
Sure thing, sure thing.

886
01:23:55,575 --> 01:23:59,229
Vegans. Kindest people on the planet.

887
01:23:59,329 --> 01:24:03,456
Takes a man who don't eat animals
to treat a human being right.

888
01:24:03,556 --> 01:24:06,541
Sit on down. We will stay a minute.

889
01:24:07,004 --> 01:24:11,580
And don't you tell those other fuckers down
in the... at the shelter about this, okay?

890
01:24:17,915 --> 01:24:20,852
I... I'd play but it's out of tune.

891
01:24:20,952 --> 01:24:24,860
It's just here to decorate the place.
You know, class it up, that sort of...

892
01:24:26,256 --> 01:24:28,626
- I don't believe you.
- What?

893
01:24:28,726 --> 01:24:32,067
- You don't believe it's out of tune?
- I don't think you can play.

894
01:24:33,196 --> 01:24:36,441
- Is that so?
- No. I don't believe it at all.

895
01:24:36,541 --> 01:24:41,171
So, I... I gotta play or you're gonna...
gonna hurt me like you've been saying?

896
01:24:41,271 --> 01:24:43,745
Is that it? Is that... is that right?

897
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:46,344
- I'm sorry. Yeah.
- You sorry? You so...

898
01:24:46,444 --> 01:24:48,947
Would you stop fucking apologizing?

899
01:24:49,047 --> 01:24:52,261
I don't need you to believe nothing.
I know who I am...

900
01:24:52,361 --> 01:24:55,787
- You keep talking, you just keep talking.
- I keep talking 'cause I know who I am...

901
01:24:55,887 --> 01:24:57,688
No wonder nobody likes you.

902
01:24:57,788 --> 01:25:01,125
- Nobody likes me?
- People don't like you. They don't like you.

903
01:25:01,225 --> 01:25:02,998
No.

904
01:25:07,130 --> 01:25:11,104
Oh, it's... It's almost
definitely out of tune.

905
01:25:11,204 --> 01:25:14,030
- I told you.
- Yeah, it's my dad's from years ago.

906
01:25:14,130 --> 01:25:17,474
- See.
- No one's played in a while. But...

907
01:25:17,574 --> 01:25:21,312
if you guys... if you guys
can play, by all means.

908
01:25:21,412 --> 01:25:24,715
- Tickle the ivories.
- I can play. I can play like the devil.

909
01:25:24,815 --> 01:25:28,119
- I don't need to prove nothing to nobody.
- You can't play.

910
01:25:28,219 --> 01:25:32,991
You Marcus Junius Brutus. You are Judas.

911
01:25:33,091 --> 01:25:35,326
I am a musician.
I'm a damn good musician.

912
01:25:35,426 --> 01:25:37,495
I don't hear you playing.
I don't hear it.

913
01:25:37,595 --> 01:25:41,465
It's... did you hear what the man just said?
The man just said it's out of tune.

914
01:25:41,565 --> 01:25:45,002
I said it's out of tune. Would you get
the damn wax out of your ear?

915
01:25:45,102 --> 01:25:48,363
It's out of tune.
Think about my reputation.

916
01:25:48,463 --> 01:25:51,677
How can a great jazz musician like me
play a piano that's out of tune.

917
01:25:51,777 --> 01:25:54,779
Alright, okay.
Well, it's... it's all good.

918
01:25:54,879 --> 01:25:58,616
Here, I made some rice.
I made some for the both of you.

919
01:25:58,716 --> 01:26:00,967
I ain't giving him nothin'.

920
01:26:02,119 --> 01:26:04,760
You two are like an old married
couple or something?

921
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:07,062
Yeah, I give you that.

922
01:26:07,457 --> 01:26:09,860
I don't believe in gay marriage.

923
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:15,265
Or even straight marriage either.
A man should be free to have fun.

924
01:26:15,365 --> 01:26:17,802
Marriage is... isn't a God-given gift.

925
01:26:17,902 --> 01:26:21,009
It's a life sentence.
That's what marriage is.

926
01:26:27,210 --> 01:26:31,116
Finally, finally, finally,
we got some peace and quiet here.

927
01:26:31,681 --> 01:26:34,585
Alright? Okay? Give me. Can I...

928
01:26:34,685 --> 01:26:36,592
Thank you.

929
01:27:25,975 --> 01:27:29,378
And we lost our insurance.
I lost my job.

930
01:27:31,274 --> 01:27:33,911
I fell hard, long.

931
01:27:34,011 --> 01:27:36,185
I started drinking.

932
01:27:37,347 --> 01:27:42,057
Home, lost that.
And then... then she died.

933
01:27:44,721 --> 01:27:47,328
My... my daughter...

934
01:27:48,257 --> 01:27:51,333
was 12.

935
01:27:51,961 --> 01:27:55,805
At that time, Maggie was 12. She...

936
01:27:58,034 --> 01:28:00,075
I couldn't...

937
01:28:03,373 --> 01:28:07,816
I kind of went down the rabbit hole
that I couldn't...

938
01:28:10,314 --> 01:28:15,892
So she was raised by her grandmother.
My wife's mother.

939
01:28:19,756 --> 01:28:22,142
I couldn't even look at her.

940
01:28:22,242 --> 01:28:24,983
I... I just felt...

941
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:31,402
I don't know, that was about 10 years
that just kinda went away.

942
01:28:31,502 --> 01:28:34,609
About 10 years, I was...

943
01:28:37,006 --> 01:28:40,616
My mind just wouldn't become
quiet, and then...

944
01:28:41,911 --> 01:28:44,486
The noise, and then...

945
01:28:46,449 --> 01:28:48,790
some lady friends...

946
01:28:49,686 --> 01:28:52,260
who were incredibly...

947
01:28:54,024 --> 01:28:56,960
generous, and kind, nice.

948
01:28:57,060 --> 01:29:01,131
Gave me their bed, gave me their couches
and then they gave me the boot.

949
01:29:01,231 --> 01:29:03,805
So, I don't know anybody anymore.

950
01:29:11,474 --> 01:29:13,411
- Hey.
- Hey, man. How's it goin'?

951
01:29:13,511 --> 01:29:16,013
I thought they moved you
to another shelter.

952
01:29:16,113 --> 01:29:20,768
What? No, no. That jabber mouth, Dixie gave
me some dough to switch places with him.

953
01:29:20,868 --> 01:29:22,920
He said the spot had good
joo joo or somethin'.

954
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:25,256
I just wanted to get him off my back.

955
01:29:25,356 --> 01:29:27,792
I'm gonna stick around here.
I can't get into any trouble, you know.

956
01:29:27,892 --> 01:29:30,325
- I'm gonna stay here as long as I can.
- Yeah.

957
01:29:30,425 --> 01:29:33,664
Then I'm gonna go back to school
next year. You know, if benefits kick in.

958
01:29:33,764 --> 01:29:36,667
Get some kinda tight job, you know.
I'm thinking tech.

959
01:29:36,767 --> 01:29:39,503
- Good. Yeah.
- Alright, cool.

960
01:29:52,015 --> 01:29:54,318
Three quarter housing, it's illegal.

961
01:29:54,418 --> 01:29:57,478
They'll give you a tiny room,
and it stinks...

962
01:29:59,857 --> 01:30:02,740
The bunk beds stacked up to the ceiling.

963
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:05,963
Come on, you know,
there's... there's a... you...

964
01:30:06,063 --> 01:30:08,974
The van takes you and drops you off
at this... this place,

965
01:30:09,074 --> 01:30:11,068
it's right in front
of this Chinese restaurant.

966
01:30:11,168 --> 01:30:13,304
You gotta go in the basement,
climb up these stairs.

967
01:30:13,404 --> 01:30:15,406
You come at this blue door,
this little blue door.

968
01:30:15,506 --> 01:30:18,761
The next day, you come back to the shelter,
and what they'll do, you stand there...

969
01:30:18,866 --> 01:30:22,763
- Stop it. Stop! Stop. Stop. Stop talking.
- What? What?

970
01:30:22,863 --> 01:30:24,804
- What's gotten into you all of a sudden?
- Leave me alone.

971
01:30:24,904 --> 01:30:27,852
Leave you al... leave you alone?

972
01:30:27,952 --> 01:30:30,391
"Shh" yourself.

973
01:30:37,293 --> 01:30:41,399
You gotta fight the demons. You gotta
fight those demons inside of you.

974
01:30:41,499 --> 01:30:45,250
- I told you...
- You know... fuck... fuck you.

975
01:30:45,350 --> 01:30:48,606
Fuck you. I'm not gonna go down
to play this game with you.

976
01:30:48,706 --> 01:30:51,146
Stop talking.

977
01:30:53,109 --> 01:30:54,316
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

978
01:30:54,416 --> 01:30:56,059
- And fuck you.
- No, fuck you.

979
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:59,317
No, no, fuck you. I don't give a shit
about... you feeling sorry for yourself...

980
01:30:59,417 --> 01:31:02,323
Fuck you in your ass. Fuck you.

981
01:31:03,252 --> 01:31:05,427
Fuck me, indeed.

982
01:31:05,789 --> 01:31:08,830
You gonna apologize,
before I talk to you again.

983
01:31:11,494 --> 01:31:14,002
You lettin' the demons get hold of you.

984
01:31:14,430 --> 01:31:18,752
Motherfucker.
This is the beginning of the end.

985
01:31:18,852 --> 01:31:21,192
Mind your own goddamn business.

986
01:31:29,412 --> 01:31:31,749
Get away from my shit, man.
Don't touch my shit.

987
01:31:31,849 --> 01:31:34,322
Go, go. Come on...

988
01:31:35,553 --> 01:31:38,960
- You want me to pack it up for you?
- You ain't packing up shit.

989
01:31:39,656 --> 01:31:42,159
I ain't going no fuckin' where.
What's wrong with you, Mike?

990
01:31:42,259 --> 01:31:45,901
- I ain't got time for this.
- Do you know what time it is in the mornin'?

991
01:31:48,328 --> 01:31:50,668
The... you... you stay
the fuck out of this.

992
01:31:50,768 --> 01:31:52,737
- You owe me an apology.
- Lower your voice.

993
01:31:52,837 --> 01:31:54,910
- Lower my voice, or what you gonna do?
- Dixie.

994
01:31:55,010 --> 01:31:58,049
I know my rights. You cannot move me out here
in the middle of the night.

995
01:31:58,149 --> 01:32:00,295
- I wanna talk to the director.
- You pack up this shit...

996
01:32:00,395 --> 01:32:04,281
I ain't packing up shit. I ain't going
nowhere. You gonna apologize to me now?

997
01:32:04,381 --> 01:32:06,150
Will you please lower your voice?
People are sleeping.

998
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:09,084
- I was sleeping too, god damn it!
- Now you gonna sleep somewhere else.

999
01:32:09,184 --> 01:32:11,088
Sleep somewhere... fuck you.

1000
01:32:11,388 --> 01:32:14,796
Wake up. Alright, everybody up.

1001
01:32:15,593 --> 01:32:18,299
Everybody up. Come on, let's go.

1002
01:32:19,862 --> 01:32:22,337
Gentlemen, time to get up.

1003
01:32:29,672 --> 01:32:32,247
Frank, hey. Come on, get up.

1004
01:32:40,150 --> 01:32:42,757
Everybody up, guys. Come on, let's go.

1005
01:33:26,829 --> 01:33:29,170
Hey, good morning, George.

1006
01:33:30,666 --> 01:33:34,538
Hey, George. You're my 9 a.m.

1007
01:33:34,638 --> 01:33:37,211
Mr. Hammond, you have an appointment.

1008
01:33:38,608 --> 01:33:40,882
He doesn't hear me, do you think?

1009
01:33:41,377 --> 01:33:43,318
Mr. Hamm...

1010
01:33:44,180 --> 01:33:45,920
Hey.

1011
01:33:47,383 --> 01:33:49,224
How are you?

1012
01:33:50,219 --> 01:33:51,988
Doin' okay?

1013
01:33:52,088 --> 01:33:56,494
Yeah, people are just...
are gone sometimes.

1014
01:33:56,594 --> 01:34:00,631
- It doesn't make any sense.
- What do you mean?

1015
01:34:00,731 --> 01:34:03,934
- Do you need anything from inside?
- What do you make of the weather?

1016
01:34:04,034 --> 01:34:06,136
Say what?

1017
01:34:06,236 --> 01:34:09,510
You think it's... 32 degrees or more?

1018
01:34:10,640 --> 01:34:12,939
I think it's spring time.
I think it's warming up.

1019
01:34:13,039 --> 01:34:14,810
Yeah.

1020
01:34:27,757 --> 01:34:29,764
Can I use your bathroom?

1021
01:38:45,414 --> 01:38:50,620
Okay, yeah. I just... I just...
It was a bit of a shock.

1022
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:53,456
I'm sure. I'm sure it was.

1023
01:38:53,556 --> 01:38:55,930
How is everything going?

1024
01:39:32,895 --> 01:39:35,103
Coalition is on 4.

1025
01:39:54,150 --> 01:39:58,378
Hello, I'm here... Someone told me...

1026
01:40:22,378 --> 01:40:24,252
Mr. Hammond.

1027
01:40:28,050 --> 01:40:31,755
Mr. Hammond, I can't help you
if you don't tell me what you need.

1028
01:40:31,855 --> 01:40:33,894
I'm sorry, I...

1029
01:40:34,557 --> 01:40:36,631
blacked out or something.

1030
01:40:37,293 --> 01:40:39,533
Do you need medical care?

1031
01:40:40,362 --> 01:40:45,300
No. I don't really need one.
I... didn't blackout, I...

1032
01:40:46,235 --> 01:40:48,776
daydream sometimes.

1033
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:53,114
How can I help you today?

1034
01:40:53,976 --> 01:40:57,819
You can help me today. Oh, yeah.

1035
01:41:00,049 --> 01:41:02,290
Not just me.

1036
01:41:04,436 --> 01:41:06,327
Go ahead.

1037
01:41:11,393 --> 01:41:13,534
Something happened.

1038
01:41:14,496 --> 01:41:16,604
A friend of mine.

1039
01:41:17,834 --> 01:41:22,010
- Okay, what... what happened?
- He was at the... shelter.

1040
01:41:22,110 --> 01:41:24,078
Which one?

1041
01:41:28,677 --> 01:41:32,019
Do you... do you need
a glass of water or something?

1042
01:41:39,588 --> 01:41:41,662
Mr. Hammond.

1043
01:41:49,065 --> 01:41:54,071
It's okay, I need... I need
a copy of my birth certificate.

1044
01:41:54,171 --> 01:41:58,742
So that I can get a social
security card and get services.

1045
01:41:58,842 --> 01:42:00,710
Sure, okay, well...

1046
01:42:00,810 --> 01:42:03,784
I have no I... ID.

1047
01:42:07,016 --> 01:42:10,084
It's just the way it is.
I don't wanna get into it.

1048
01:42:10,184 --> 01:42:13,156
Sure, sure. Well, we... we can
write a letter on your behalf.

1049
01:42:13,256 --> 01:42:16,531
We use the Legal Aid Society.
It... it's fine.

1050
01:42:18,394 --> 01:42:20,864
- You can do that?
- Yeah, well, they can.

1051
01:42:20,964 --> 01:42:23,066
- I mean, we advocate for you.
- Really?

1052
01:42:23,166 --> 01:42:27,203
Yeah, yeah, we'll help you
navigate this every step of the way.

1053
01:42:27,803 --> 01:42:32,175
Do you have money
for the application, and...

1054
01:42:32,275 --> 01:42:36,151
Yeah, it's okay. We'll figure it out.
We'll figure it out.

1055
01:42:42,384 --> 01:42:47,328
This shelter, you'd... you said
something about your shelter.

1056
01:42:48,190 --> 01:42:49,997
Yeah.

1057
01:43:02,104 --> 01:43:04,779
I just need my birth certificate.

1058
01:43:06,075 --> 01:43:08,579
Are you okay... otherwise?

1059
01:43:08,679 --> 01:43:12,820
I mean, the shelter, you said something
happened to a friend of yours.

1060
01:43:16,018 --> 01:43:18,225
It's all good now.

1061
01:43:19,621 --> 01:43:23,564
- It's all good.
- Okay, alright, well, let's...

1062
01:43:23,892 --> 01:43:26,246

Got some change, man?

1065
01:43:32,434 --> 01:43:34,675

- Beer, untapped...
- I'm not gonna give you any more money, so...

1078
01:45:19,908 --> 01:45:22,746
I'd like a beer... untapped.

1079
01:45:22,846 --> 01:45:26,354
- Any kind.
- It isn't cheap.

1080
01:46:21,136 --> 01:46:23,711
- Thank you.
- What else?

1081
01:46:27,309 --> 01:46:29,350
Excuse me?

1082
01:46:32,349 --> 01:46:34,117
Excuse me?

01:46:37,086 --> 01:46:38,588
- Yeah, you got the card.
- I have your account, yep.

1085
01:46:38,688 --> 01:46:40,795
Last name, Greyson.

01:46:59,708 --> 01:47:01,778
I'm glad you got
the Owe Me Down, it's nice.

01:47:01,878 --> 01:47:05,715
Yeah, it's good, right? And now we're
getting something new from the next week.

1088
01:47:05,815 --> 01:47:07,521
Okay.

1089
01:47:18,260 --> 01:47:20,334
Thanks, man.

1090
01:47:26,768 --> 01:47:29,376
- Alright. Thanks.
- Yup.

1091
01:47:43,719 --> 01:47:46,861
What do you want?
You can't just come in here and...

1092
01:47:50,392 --> 01:47:52,295
I'm just sitting here.
I'm just sitting...

1093
01:47:52,395 --> 01:47:55,565
No, I don't buy that.
I think it is something else.

1094
01:47:55,665 --> 01:47:58,868
So what else is it that
you owe me this occasion of...

1095
01:47:58,968 --> 01:48:01,542
coming in here and drinking beer?

1096
01:48:25,761 --> 01:48:27,635
For me?

1097
01:48:29,314 --> 01:48:34,754
"To whom it may concern. I write on behalf
of George Hammond, a client of the...

1098
01:48:34,854 --> 01:48:39,196
"Mr. Hammond is homeless, residing
temporarily at the Men's Shelter.

1099
01:48:40,376 --> 01:48:44,168
"He has no source of income, and as
a result we request that this application

1100
01:48:44,268 --> 01:48:48,790
"for emergency food stamps,
cash benefits and...

1101
01:48:51,019 --> 01:48:54,277
his benefits card
be processed on his behalf."

1102
01:49:00,863 --> 01:49:05,519
That's to... to get a copy
of my birth certificate. That's...

1103
01:49:05,819 --> 01:49:08,008
that's what it's for.

1104
01:49:13,542 --> 01:49:15,383
So...

1105
01:49:32,260 --> 01:49:35,469
Maggie, I just wanted to see ya.

1106
01:49:38,333 --> 01:49:41,875
Alright, fine, then drink your beer.

1107
01:49:42,270 --> 01:49:45,459
Then you have to leave. It's on me.

1108
01:49:48,944 --> 01:49:51,118
Can I have another one?

1109
01:49:54,616 --> 01:49:57,558
No, you have to leave.

1110
01:49:58,654 --> 01:50:01,695
- Why is that?
- 'Cause...

1111
01:50:03,258 --> 01:50:05,196
- 'Cause what?
- 'Cause we have rules, you know.

1112
01:50:05,296 --> 01:50:07,859
- This is a private establishment.
- I have my rights, you know.

1113
01:50:07,959 --> 01:50:10,103
I got my rights here.

1114
01:50:24,846 --> 01:50:28,418
I just... really... I don't know
what you want me to do.

1115
01:50:28,518 --> 01:50:30,624
I mean, what do you want?

1116
01:50:32,020 --> 01:50:35,970
I don't know what I could actually do
that I haven't already tried, or...

1117
01:50:38,059 --> 01:50:39,767
'Cause...

1118
01:50:40,162 --> 01:50:42,336
normally, it's...

1119
01:50:42,831 --> 01:50:46,874
you know, the parents
takes care of the kid.

1120
01:50:47,302 --> 01:50:49,843
Not really the other way around.

1121
01:50:50,238 --> 01:50:51,979
So...

1122
01:51:10,392 --> 01:51:13,400
Where are you staying? Where is it?

1123
01:51:16,814 --> 01:51:18,555
Nah.

1124
01:51:22,337 --> 01:51:24,634
Why are you doing this?

1125
01:51:26,508 --> 01:51:28,448
I have...

1126
01:51:28,744 --> 01:51:31,151
You don't have to worry about me.

1127
01:51:39,187 --> 01:51:42,932
Wait a minute. Wait... wait a minute.

1128
01:51:52,768 --> 01:51:54,537
- No, you gotta go.
- It's alright.

1129
01:51:54,637 --> 01:51:57,644
Just leave.
Just... just get out of here.

1130
01:51:58,139 --> 01:51:59,880
Leave!

1131
01:52:19,227 --> 01:52:21,034
Sorry.

1132
01:57:27,735 --> 01:57:29,609
Thank you.
