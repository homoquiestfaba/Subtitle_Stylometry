00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:33,436
Or we have our TrÃ¨s Beau

174
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,063
with its goldia
floral etching,

175
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:37,106
enhanced in
a smoky-silver tone.

176
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,317
Does anyone else feel really
fucking gay right now?

177
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:41,569
Ed! Let's go with the TrÃ¨s Beau.

178
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:44,447
TrÃ©s Beau tussie-mussie
is fabulous.

179
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,658
Christ, somebody just shoot me.
I'll be outside.

180
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:49,869
EDMUNDO: All right, team, can
we all gather around, please?

181
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,331
Okay. I have everything
I need for the bridesmaids,

182
00:06:54,499 --> 00:06:58,419
but I am still missing
the groomsmen's information.

183
00:06:58,503 --> 00:07:01,214
What? Honey, you told me you
spoke to all the groomsmen.

184
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:03,216
(STAMMERS) See,
I sent them an email,

185
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:04,967
but you know how guys are.

186
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:07,136
They just haven't
responded yet.

187
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,471
Babe, I know
you've been really busy,

188
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:10,348
but our wedding
is in 10 days.

189
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:11,474
I mean,
can't your best man

190
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:12,642
help you with
all of this?

191
00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:17,063
Uh, but you see,
Bic's still in El Salvador.

192
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:19,732
Well, let's hope he's in LA next week.
(SNICKERS)

193
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:21,359
DOUG: Oh, he will be.
Mom.

194
00:07:22,318 --> 00:07:23,611
He'll be there.

195
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:26,781
Okay, look, why don't I
just contact Mr. Rambis,

196
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:29,951
Mr. Garvey, Mr. Plunkett, Mr.
Carew,

197
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:33,538
Mr. Drysdale, Mr. Alzado, Mr.
Dickerson?

198
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:36,165
I can't breathe.
Mister, are you okay?

199
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:37,250
GRETCHEN: Honey.
(GASPS)

200
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,376
Honey!

201
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:41,587
Unless you are
planning to run,

202
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:45,007
you are backing yourself
into a very tight corner.

203
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:46,801
I'm not sure I understand
what you're implying.

204
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:49,470
Three out of seven of your
groomsmen are Hall of Famers.

205
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:51,305
She'll leave me, I know. You're
not gonna tell her, are you?

206
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,683
She's going to find out soon enough.
Oh, God.

207
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:55,184
Why didn't you say
something to me before?

208
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:57,562
I've been on a bullet train
ever since I proposed.

209
00:07:57,687 --> 00:07:59,021
I haven't slept
in months.

210
00:07:59,105 --> 00:08:02,358
I can't keep anything down. I
keep losing weight. I just...

211
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:04,068
I just want her
to be happy.

212
00:08:04,152 --> 00:08:06,195
The truth
is always the best.

213
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,072
What if the truth
isn't an option?

214
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,657
Well...

215
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:12,451
There is one other thing.

216
00:08:12,577 --> 00:08:13,911
â™ª Oh, babe!

217
00:08:14,078 --> 00:08:16,372
â™ª I don't wanna lie

218
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:19,500
â™ª I'm gonna take
what you're giving

219
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:22,587
â™ª 'Cause I know
you're willing

220
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:24,547
â™ª To take me all the way

221
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,592
â™ª You got me right here

222
00:08:27,717 --> 00:08:29,552
â™ª Combustible

223
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:33,890
â™ª And I can't wait
to finally explode

224
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:36,392
â™ª The big, big bang

225
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:38,394
â™ª The reason I'm alive

226
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:41,230
Hey, hey! Lou,knock
that shit off, man.

227
00:08:41,314 --> 00:08:42,774
(GROANS)
Don't worry about Lou.

228
00:08:42,857 --> 00:08:45,026
He had half his brain
removed two years ago.

229
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:46,611
LOU: Fuck off.
Okay.

230
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:51,866
Hey, uh, do you know where
I can find the basement?

231
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:54,869
â™ª The big, big bang

232
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:57,371
â™ª The reason I'm alive

233
00:08:57,455 --> 00:08:59,665
â™ª When all the stars collide

234
00:08:59,749 --> 00:09:02,251
â™ª In this universe inside

235
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,462
â™ª The big, big bang

236
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:06,547
(DOOR BUZZING)

237
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:08,174
â™ª Oh, babe â™ª

238
00:09:09,634 --> 00:09:10,968
May I help you?

239
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:12,845
Hi. Yeah.

240
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:15,181
Yeah, um, I'm looking
for Jimmy Callahan.

241
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:16,891
Who sent you? The Goose?

242
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:19,060
No. Um, Edmundo.
Ah.

243
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:21,938
Welcome to
The Best Man Inc.

244
00:09:22,146 --> 00:09:23,689
â™ª It's a beautiful night

245
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,859
â™ª We're looking for
something dumb to do

246
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:30,112
(â™ª Hey, Dab)'

247
00:09:30,238 --> 00:09:32,657
â™ª I think I wanna marry you.

248
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:36,410
â™ª Just say I do

249
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:43,626
â™ª Tell me right now, baby

250
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:44,877
â™ª I think I wanna marry
you â™ª (DOOR OPENS)

251
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:48,506
So, Edmundo sent you
to come find the Oracle.

252
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:49,632
What can I do for you?

253
00:09:49,674 --> 00:09:51,926
Hi. Yeah, I guess I do have
a few questions. Mmm-hmm.

254
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:54,845
Um, what exactly
do you do?

255
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:57,181
I provide best man
services for guys

256
00:09:57,265 --> 00:09:59,475
like yourself who
lack in such areas.

257
00:10:00,268 --> 00:10:01,769
So, I'm not alone?

258
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:04,397
Alone? No. I run a very profitable
business because of guys like you.

259
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:05,898
Here's a fun fact for you.

260
00:10:05,982 --> 00:10:07,400
A kid goes to
Cornell University.

261
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:09,110
He obviously has way too
much time on his hands.

262
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:10,611
He recently confirmed
the number

263
00:10:10,695 --> 00:10:12,321
of real friends
the average American has.

264
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:13,572
That means we're
not talking about

265
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:14,907
the phony
Facebook friends here.

266
00:10:14,991 --> 00:10:15,950
We're talking
about the friends

267
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,201
who know where
your porn stash is.

268
00:10:17,285 --> 00:10:19,829
That number has dropped from
three to two since 1985.

269
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,206
Really?
I don't have any.

270
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,126
How many weddings do you think
were in the US last year?

271
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:26,794
Four hundred and fifty...

272
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:29,130
2.4 million.
Four million.

273
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:31,215
That means there were
2.4 million grooms.

274
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:33,009
Do you think that each and
every single one of them

275
00:10:33,092 --> 00:10:34,802
has somebody
to be their best man?

276
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,971
Wow. I never knew
people like you existed.

277
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,014
I'm like an angel.

278
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,390
I'm only there when you need me to be.
(DOOR OPENS)

279
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:41,767
Excuse me. You got to
get going, Jimmy.

280
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:43,769
Beth Shalom, right?
Beth Yirmeyahu.

281
00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:44,937
I don't understand
why they do these things

282
00:10:45,021 --> 00:10:46,564
in the middle of traffic.
It's annoying.

283
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:48,357
So, what did you
tell your fiancÃ©e?

284
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:50,484
I, uh, told her that
I have a best man lined up.

285
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,945
You gave her the old Norton Winchell, huh?
I did what now?

286
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,905
The Norton Winchell. It's
the imaginary-friend covet

287
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:56,407
It's an amateur move,
but it's common.

288
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,950
What about your parents?
They in on it?

289
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,243
Oh, you don't have to
worry about them.

290
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:00,828
Why, they protesting
the marriage?

291
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:03,247
No, they passed away several years ago.
That's perfect.

292
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:05,082
Is this a large wedding
or a small wedding?

293
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,208
Large.

294
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:07,793
Social or family?
Social.

295
00:11:07,877 --> 00:11:09,337
Hancock Park,
Bel Air, Palisades?

296
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,880
Downtown,
Millennium Biltmore.

297
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:12,506
All right. Let's go
over some of my packages.

298
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,508
If you're looking for
a basic Single Wing Ringman,

299
00:11:14,592 --> 00:11:15,634
that's where
I'm your best man,

300
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:16,927
I attend your wedding
for the full day.

301
00:11:17,053 --> 00:11:18,429
Okay. If you need something
a little more involved,

302
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,431
where I participate in all the
festivities for the weekend,

303
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,350
then you're talking
about a Bronze Bow Tie.

304
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:23,684
Now, if you've got
real problems,

305
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:25,061
what you need
is a Silver Cuff Link.

306
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:26,687
Now, that includes everything
in the Bronze Bow Tie

307
00:11:26,771 --> 00:11:27,855
plus an additional
three groomsmen

308
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:29,023
to balance out
the bridesmaids.

309
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:30,524
For an extra
thousand dollars,

310
00:11:30,608 --> 00:11:31,942
I'll throw you a bachelor
party to your liking.

311
00:11:32,193 --> 00:11:33,903
How are you looking on groomsmen?
Not good at all.

312
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:35,988
Not good as in
you need one or two?

313
00:11:36,072 --> 00:11:37,406
I need seven.

314
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,534
You need seven groomsmen?
I do.

315
00:11:40,618 --> 00:11:42,870
Do you have any idea
what you're asking for?

316
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:44,955
You're asking me to
pull off a Golden Tux.

317
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:46,874
Yeah. See, I don't see that
on this pamphlet here.

318
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:48,125
It's not on the pamphlet.

319
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:49,418
Because what you're
talking about

320
00:11:49,502 --> 00:11:50,961
is what we joke
about around here.

321
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:53,881
That's a laugh. "Hey, we should
try to do a Golden Tux."

322
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:54,924
(LAUGHING)

323
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,675
Too many moving parts.
Too many things can go wrong.

324
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:57,885
No. But there's a name for it.

325
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,637
There's also a name for a horse
with a horn on its head.

326
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,472
It's called a unicorn. It
doesn't mean I can get you one.

327
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,599
She will leave me.
I need your help.

328
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:05,559
You're talking about
unchartered territory.

329
00:12:05,643 --> 00:12:07,853
No one's ever asked me
to pull off a Golden Tux.

330
00:12:07,937 --> 00:12:09,605
And in less
than two weeks?

331
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:12,650
I have a nice job,
I have a real nice business.

332
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,026
I don't need this
kind of pressure, man.

333
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,779
I don't care how much it costs.
I need a Golden Tux!

334
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:22,701
Are you sure
she's worth it?

335
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,913
A guy like me doesn't
land a girl like her.

336
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:28,207
So, I lied about having
a bunch of friends.

337
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,084
I thought it would
make me look cool.

338
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:31,794
Never did I think
she would like me,

339
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,421
let alone agree
to marry me.

340
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:36,215
I am marrying a girl
who, all my life,

341
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:38,217
I never would have thought
would have looked at me twice.

342
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,885
And I am marrying her.

343
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:43,764
What's a little white lie
in the face of that?

344
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:48,811
Please help me. I don't
know what else to do.

345
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:52,440
I love this girl.

346
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,028
I'm late.
Come on, get in the car.

347
00:12:58,112 --> 00:12:59,196
Really?

348
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:00,990
Yeah.
Should I follow you...

349
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:02,116
No, get in my car.
Come on.

350
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:03,200
And you'll drop
me off back here...

351
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:04,785
Will you just get in the
damn car, please? Okay.

352
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:06,954
I'm late, man.
God damn it.

353
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:08,497
Fucking white people.

I would like to bring up

356
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:15,963
Stuart's best friend
to say a few words.

00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:18,716
(ORGAN PLAYING)

358
00:13:25,473 --> 00:13:26,724
Just five short years ago,

359
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:28,767
when I spoke at
Stuart's wedding,

360
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:30,561
I never expected

361
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,438
to be speaking
at his funeral so soon.

00:13:35,608 --> 00:13:37,943
at A.J. Wilson High School,

365
00:13:38,027 --> 00:13:39,695
I was bullied quite often.

366
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:42,531
I remember one time when
these kids took my lunch

367
00:13:42,615 --> 00:13:43,949
and spilled it
all over my lap.

368
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:46,368
After they did it,
they started to

369
00:13:46,452 --> 00:13:48,078
call me mean names.
(SCOFFS)

370
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:50,581
Some of them even
called me Pupil Jew-Jew.

371
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,833
Because they said when they turned
the lights out in the hallway,

372
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:54,168
all they could see
was my eye pupils.

373

"Sha boing boing,
you black Jew-Jew."

378
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:06,847
I was covered
in sloppy Joe

379
00:14:06,931 --> 00:14:08,599
and mashed potatoes
and vegetable medley.

380
00:14:09,058 --> 00:14:11,101
And, uh, I look up,

381
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:15,272
and I see Stu.

382
00:14:15,356 --> 00:14:18,943
He was standing there
with a handful of napkins.

383
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:21,028
And a smile on his face

384
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:23,280
as if to say, "Everything
was going to be okay."

00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:26,283
Stuart may have gone to that
big Shabbat in the sky,

but he's still with us.

387
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,871
He's up there
making sad angels laugh

388
00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:32,998
and he's giving
hopeless angels hope.

389
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:34,583
And he's giving
small, little, black,

390
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:36,835
Jewish angels with
a face full of corn

391

Man, don't worry
about it.

All those things that you said about
him, those incredible things.

He really sounds like a great guy.
Who, Reinsdorf?

400
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:03,279
Reinsdorf was
a piece of shit.

years of said wedding...

Serious as paint.

If I do this,
you need to understand

409
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:20,421
this is strictly
a business relationship.

410
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:21,839
Right. You're not
buying a new friend.

411
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,340
You're hiring a best man.
Got it.

412
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:24,883
Clients sometimes
blur that line.

413
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:25,926

for a friend.

No, my name. I'm assuming you made
up a name for me. What is it?

00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:39,189
Oh, I thought it was
a trick question.

of desperation.

and if someone
asks you who said it,

430
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:53,621
you tell them
Bic Mitchum said it.

there's no more candy?

whatever the fuck he wants!

finally meet you.

452
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:33,494
What do we do now?

453
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:35,120
You go get some rest.

454
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:36,330
Take care of them bags
under your eyes.

more in a lot less time.

some damn friends.

Just keep your eye on the
ball, you little fucker.

460
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,591
And you're sure I'll get laid?
Yes.

461
00:16:47,675 --> 00:16:48,842
Because I haven't gotten
any since I got out.

462

Do you guarantee that?

464
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:56,767
I can't guarantee that, but I'm
quite sure that they will want you.

465

Oh!

470
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:06,318
Don't talk to
Jimmy like that.

doing, Fitz?

I'm hungry.

476
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:19,665
Okay, I'll be right there.

Look, Jimmy,
I'd love to help you out,

I'd get out of the game.

me up with this job.

while I learn to plumb.

483
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:32,219
Stop. You look at me now and tell
me that you don't want back in.

you put the salad dressing,

to smuggle

flight, aren't you?

Isn't that what
you're doing?

491
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:46,525
Go on, girl.
You're good.

492
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:47,943
Have a nice flight.
Ooh!

better than this, Reggie.

Wolfgang? No, Hockey Puck, idiot.
'Yes,Wolfgang.

00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,659
The only thing they've got
in this place is Cinnabon.

497
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:57,911
I've been eating
Cinnabon for breakfast,

498
00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:00,164
lunch, and dinner
for the past six months.

499
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,999
Reggie, I don't need...
Okay? Of course I'm in.

500
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,167
That's all I needed to know.

501
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,251
Come on. We've a lot
of work to do.

502
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:05,502
Now?
Yes, now.

I'm back in the game, baby.

was able to reschedule

tasting to tomorrow.

There's only a week left

507
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:15,846
and we still have
so much to do.

508
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:18,098
Doug, what are you doing?

509
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:20,517
I thought maybe we'd have
a little ice cream

510
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:23,562
and then perhaps
some dessert.

511
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,856
Oh, that is so not fair.
You know I'm trying

512
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,733
to lose 4.2 pounds
before the wedding.

513
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,777
Well, I think you look beautiful
just the way you are.

514
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,111
And I got you something else.

515
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:32,321
What?

516
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:34,907
Ta-da.

(GASPS) on, my God.

518
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:37,993
I remember when we watched
Girl with a Pearl Earring,

519
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:39,328
and you said
how pretty you thought

520
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:40,621
the girl's pearl earring was.

521
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:41,955
So, I went out
and had it remade.

522
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:43,373
You know, as a pair.

523
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:45,375
Oh, my God.
You are so sweet.

524
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:47,169
That was so unnecessary.

00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:53,717
You know, I was thinking

528
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:56,094
of a way to alleviate

529
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,305
all that stress
you've been feeling.

530
00:18:58,472 --> 00:18:59,598
That is not fair.

531
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:01,225
Remember, we said no teasing
each other. Mmm-mmm.

532
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,477
I know we agreed to
the whole "no making love"

533
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,978
"for the last month" rule.

534
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:06,188
That's a lot of quotes.

535
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:08,482
Yeah, but maybe
I could request

536
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,442
a temporary stay of the ban.

537
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:13,529
No. Honey, look,
I would love to, okay?

538
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:15,656

this will enhance

539
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,533
our emotional reunification.

540
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:20,369
I know. Maybe we could
take one night off.

541
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:22,663
(STAMMERS)
Can we do that, maybe?

542
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:24,373
Just for one night.

543
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:25,999
To just have sex?

544
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,210
Honey, you know this is
difficult for me, too, okay?

545
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,838
But I am willing to make
the necessary sacrifice

at Camp Wampacheempi.

548

We were both 12, and we used
to sneak out together at night

and hunt bullfrogs and...

550
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,685

tries to save Rose...

Stop. We specifically asked for monologues.
We don't want any scenes.

that this would...

that boxes you in, you boomerang it.
"Boomerang"?

You respond with either a
compliment or a question.

Compliments are for women.
Questions are for men.

something about Bic

haven't discussed,

You're, um, very handsome.

Compliments are for women,
questions are for men.

663
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:41,797
You throw out random words.

You're confusing me
a lot right now.

665
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:44,758

that will distract them

from the original question.

667
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:47,052

The how-where-whats.

These are the three
basic questions

674
00:23:56,937 --> 00:23:58,688
that everyone I encounter
as Bic are going to ask.

675
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:01,191
How did we meet? Where am I from?
What do I do?

676
00:24:01,358 --> 00:24:03,819
If we know nothing else,
we can tread enough water

677
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:06,279
to fake a stomach cramp and run away.
How did we meet?

678
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:08,615
Uh, freshman year,
Stanford.

679
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:10,575
That means I'm smart.
Shit. Where am I from?

00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:12,369
I never said.
North Dakota.

681
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:14,371
Why North Dakota? Do you know
anybody in North Dakota?

682
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:16,164
No.
Nobody does. What do I do?

683
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,416
You're in the military. That a boy.
See, now you're thinking.

684
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,918
No address, no phone number.

685
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:21,711
And chicks dig
the uniform shit.

686
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:23,296
It's going to be like
shooting fish in a barrel.

687
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,298
Actually, I, uh, don't
think you're going to be

688
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:27,134
shooting any fish
in this particular barrel.

689
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:28,385
An Army guy
that's the best man

690
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:29,636
not hitting on
the bridesmaids?

691
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:30,971
They'll think
I'm a homosexual.

692
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:32,222
Well, uh, actually...

693
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:34,432
Well, actually, what? You told
them I'm a homosexual, Doug?

694
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:36,476
No. No, not that,
per se.

695
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,186
What, per se, Doug?
Tell me.

696
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:41,106
Bic Mitchum is actually
Father Bic Mitchum.

697
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:42,774
You told them
I'm a fucking priest, Doug?

698
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:45,026
Well, actually, it was
Gretchen who said it.

699
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,695
You told Gretchen
I'm a fucking priest, Doug?

700
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:47,946
No. Gretchen said...

701
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:49,322
There was nothing else
that popped into your head?

702
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:50,991
At the time I thought it
was a really smart idea.

703
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:52,033
A fucking priest?

704
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:54,911
But now I can see it's going to upset you.
A fucking priest?

705
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:58,915
Fuck! Fuck, shit, bitch, dick, ass!
No. No, you can't.

706
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:00,625
Oh, well, I have to
get them all out now

707
00:25:00,709 --> 00:25:02,169
because I'm a fucking
priest and I can't

708
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:03,920
cuss around
your family, Doug. Fuck!

709
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:06,006
Oh, come on.
That's the last one.

710
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,008
(JIMMY READING)

711
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:09,968
Jill Abromowitz,
freshman year.

712
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:12,053
Far-sighted or near-sighted'?
Far-sighted.

713
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,764
Okay. Wait, let me finish.
And near-sighted.

714
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:17,350
Do you supinate or pronate?
What?

715
00:25:17,475 --> 00:25:19,603
Does your foot roll inward or outward?
Outward.

716
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:21,188
Okay, that explains
the weight gain.

717
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:24,232
Pepsi or Coke?
Sunset, full moon?

718
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:26,026
If you could pick your favorite
superhero, who would it be?

719
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:27,235
Is Pas-Man a superhero?

720
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:28,403
No, he's not, Doug.

721
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,864
Stairs or elevators?
Never mind. Forget it.

722
00:25:30,947 --> 00:25:32,908
Okay, Doug, I'm almost happy right now.
What's my name?

723
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:34,701
That would be Bic: Mitchum.
Where am I from?

724
00:25:34,784 --> 00:25:35,869
You're from North Dakota.

725
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:37,037
Ask me why you're
from North Dakota.

726
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,330
Tell me why I'm
from North Dakota.

727
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:40,707
Because who the fuck knows
anybody from North Dakota?

728
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,292
I want to hear my name again.
What's my name?

729
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,502
Oh, you are motherfucking Bic Mitchum!
Rhythm.

730
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:45,962
BOTH: Motherfucking
Bic Mitchum.

731
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:48,798
Motherfucking Bic Mitchum.
Motherfucking... (EXCLAIMS)

732
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:50,050
What are your phobias?

733
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:51,468
Uh, I fear raccoons.

734
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:52,636
Favorite sport, Doug?

735
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:55,347
Baseball. And I love
women's basketball.

736
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:58,892
Come on, we're getting
too tired. Up. Yes.

737
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:00,936
(BOTH GRUNTING)

738
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:02,187
JIMMY: Oh, shit.

739
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:07,108
Doug! Doug!

740
00:26:07,317 --> 00:26:09,569
Get up. Get your ass up. We're
going to be late for brunch.

741
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:10,695
Oh, shit!

742
00:26:11,196 --> 00:26:12,447
JIMMY: When you get
backed into a corner,

743
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,491
remember your compliments,
boomerang, random words.

744
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:15,575
DOUG: Use random words.

745
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,786
Specifically, which
random words should I use?

746
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:21,164
Any random words. Just be yourself, Doug.
You'll be all right.

747
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:22,749
What if they start
asking too many questions?

748
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:24,709
I mean, you hardly
even know me.

749
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:26,920
Except for the fact that you
prefer showers to baths,

750
00:26:27,003 --> 00:26:28,380
Pas-Man's your favorite
superhero even though

751
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:29,798
Pas-Man's not
a superhero at all,

752
00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:31,967
you're far-sighted and you're
near-sighted, you supinate,

753
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:34,594
you prefer full moons over sunsets,
you're afraid of raccoons,

754
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:36,554
you love women's basketball,
you iron your boxers,

755
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:37,639
finished third
on the bar exam,

756
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:38,723
eat American,
but prefer cheddar,

757
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:40,934
you're against the designated hitter,
believe in life after death,

758
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:42,727
and you played the violin
until you were 19 years old.

759
00:26:42,811 --> 00:26:45,188
Which is the same year that you lost
your virginity to Jill Abromowitz.

760
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:46,773
Let's go, man.

761
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:47,857
That will work.

762
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:51,027
You follow my lead. You
talk as little as you can.

763
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:54,281
Short answers. You don't
initiate conversation. Wi-Wo.

764
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:56,366
"Wi-Wo"?
We're in, we're out.

765
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:57,826
Oh. Wi-WO.

766
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:59,661
Wait, wait, wait.
What?

767
00:26:59,911 --> 00:27:01,746
I'm getting a little nauseous, man.
What?

768
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:03,748
I think I'm in over my head, Doug.
No, no.

769
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:05,709
This is a lot. You're talking
about a whole family.

770
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,043
I've never done
a goddamn whole family.

771
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:08,461
You're telling me
this now?

772
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:09,713
What's your last name?

773
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:10,922
Harris. Doug Harris.

774
00:27:11,006 --> 00:27:12,465
Oh, shit!
I thought it was Angley.

775
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:14,134
What? Who's Angley?

776
00:27:14,217 --> 00:27:16,219
I have to go, buddy.
No!

777
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:17,470
I'm fucking with you.

778
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:18,972
Don't do that.
All right, relax.

779
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:20,140
That was a really
shitty thing to do.

780
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:22,392
Ring the bell, rookie.
Come on.

781
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:24,144
You guys have to understand
that I come from

782
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:25,729
a very dark past.

783
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:27,314
And by dark,
of course I'm referring

784
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:29,399
to my drug use.
I was on everything.

785
00:27:29,566 --> 00:27:32,068
At one point, the only good
vein I had was between my toes.

786
00:27:32,235 --> 00:27:34,863
Crystal meth. I'm not sure if any
of you guys can relate to it.

787
00:27:34,946 --> 00:27:36,281
Grandma,
I've seen your teeth.

788
00:27:36,364 --> 00:27:37,574
Maybe you can, or can't.

789
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:41,036
But the Lord says, "Don't
judgeth upon what happens",

790
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,413
"but what happens upon
what can't be judged."

791
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:44,664
Which means, yes,

792
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:46,041
I may have been to a point

793
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:47,917
where I was sucking
dick for money.

794
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:51,338
But that day when I woke up
face down in that snowbank,

795
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:52,672
I didn't know where I was.

796
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:54,632
I didn't even know
who I was.

797
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:55,967
And I remember
squinting because

798
00:27:56,051 --> 00:27:57,552
I was being blinded
by this bright light.

799
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:58,636
I couldn't see a thing.

800
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,098
And when I finally opened
my eyes, I saw Jesus.

801
00:28:02,182 --> 00:28:03,475
You saw Jesus?

802
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:04,809
Oh, I saw Jesus.

803
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,146
He was in Mary's arms in the
nativity scene at St. Michael's.

804
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:11,649
And I wept. But they
weren't tears of pain.

805
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:12,901
These were tears of joy.

806
00:28:12,984 --> 00:28:14,778
From having found
my path, of course.

807
00:28:14,861 --> 00:28:16,154
So, Father...

808
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:17,655
Call me Bic, please.

809
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:20,367
What made you decide
to go into the military?

810
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,160
Mmm.
That's a great question.

811
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:24,537
Some people are called on
to serve God.

812
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:26,206
Others are called
to serve our country.

813
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:28,208
Those who are
chosen to serve both,

814
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:29,709
they're called
Army chaplains.

815
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:32,420
I got a two-way call
from the big fellow himself.

816
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:33,797
(LAUGHING)

817
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,548
A priest in the military.
Yeah.

818
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:37,592
It's interesting.
Do they have a "don't ask",

819
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:39,886
"don't tell" policy
on child molesting?

820
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:41,096
Dad!

821
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:42,972
(LAUGHING)

822
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:45,767
(HIGH-PITCHED LAUGHING)

823
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:51,898
Oh, it's okay. It's okay.

824
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:55,276
That's pretty good. I've never heard
that one. Now, that's a good one.

825
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:56,528
Well, I try.

826
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:58,071
Clever.
No, it wasn't.

827
00:28:58,154 --> 00:28:59,364
Somebody call the firemen

828
00:28:59,447 --> 00:29:01,366
because this is hot,
hot, hot! Okay?

829
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:02,909
Do not touch.
(LAUGHING)

830
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:06,329
So, listen,
if you opt against

831
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:07,997
the Russian
mushroom bisque,

832
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:10,917
we can always go into
a more rustic theme

833
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,710
with the Chilean chili.

834
00:29:13,044 --> 00:29:14,796
I'll be back
with the croutons.

835
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:18,633
So, Bic, uh, where are
you from originally?

836
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:20,343
Originally? North Dakota.

837
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:22,929
Oh, no kidding. What town?
Henderson.

838
00:29:23,012 --> 00:29:24,639
I've never heard
of Henderson.

839
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:26,224
Oh, Henderson's
a very small town, Ed.

840
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:28,017
Oh, where is it
in relation to Bismarck?

841
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:30,937
Are you familiar
with North Dakota?

842
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,605
Ed's uncle has
a ranch up there.

843
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:34,983
Wow! That is something
to know, there.

844
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:37,277
Uh, no, it's actually on the
opposite side of Bismarck.

845
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,487
You have Bismarck here,
but once you go around...

846
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:41,114
You know the tunnel.
It's right there.

847
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:42,490
Bismarck's in the middle.

848
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:44,993
When you said "middle", all I saw
was Rita Hayworth. (CHUCKLES)

849
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:47,036
I mean, there's a striking
resemblance, isn't it?

850
00:29:47,162 --> 00:29:48,288
Oh, thank you, Father.

851
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:49,539
No, there isn't.

852
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:52,083
So, Doug,
when was the last time

853
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:54,169
that you and Bic
saw each other?

854
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:57,755
March.
March?

855
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:58,965
Well, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

856
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:01,217
Because,see, in March... April,
I was in the Middle East.

857
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:03,803
Muffin juice. After that
is when I was training.

858
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:04,929
Cottage cheese helmet.

859
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:06,931
And from there is
when I was traveling,

860
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:08,057
so you're talking
three, four...

861
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:10,059
Three, four, six, seven months ago.
...six, seven years ago.

862
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:11,144
Years ago.

863
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:13,188
Honey, I thought you saw Bic at
the Vatican a couple years ago.

864
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:14,272
Wait, what did you say?

865
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:16,274
When you were in Rome,
you and Bic.

866
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:18,943
Oh, boy, that's right.
Because you left in March.

867
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:20,612
Red-hot pussy seltzer.

868
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:22,697
(GASPS)
Right? Right. Yeah.

869
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,781
That sounds right.

870
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:25,200
What did you just say?
DOUG: Hmm?

871
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:27,535
I think you said,
"Red-hot pussy seltzer."

872
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:29,746
Why would you say that?
ED: Red-hot pussy seltzer?

873
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:31,789
GRETCHEN: Honey?

874
00:30:32,415 --> 00:30:34,459
What's 34 times 12?
408.

875
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:36,669
Shit, I didn't expect
an answer that quick.

876
00:30:36,753 --> 00:30:37,754
Breathe, Doug.

877
00:30:37,879 --> 00:30:39,589
Baby, what is going on with you?

I, um...

880
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:45,678
I have to be
honest with you guys.

Guys, that was so hot. I'm sorry, Doug.
It burns!

885

Oh, God!

886
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:57,232
Sorry. I didn't know
it was that hot, guys.

887
00:30:57,398 --> 00:30:58,858
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.

What is wrong with you?

00:31:22,173 --> 00:31:23,258
I'm going to get
something else!

898
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:26,135
She just caught fire
so fast.

899
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:30,181
Don't feel bad, Doug. She goes
through a can of Aqua Net a day.

900
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:33,101
Hey, what did they say? Is she okay?
Is she going to be all right?

901
00:31:33,268 --> 00:31:36,229
Gretchen, how do you
like your grandma?

902
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:39,482
What? I love her. You know that.
What happened?

903
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:41,734
No, I mean, how do you like her?
Medium, well-done?

904
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:42,944
Oh, my God, Dad.

905
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:44,195
You can be
such an asshole.

906
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:45,738
She has some minor burns

907
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:47,574
to her head, chest,
back, neck, and breasts,

908
00:31:47,657 --> 00:31:49,284
but the doctor says
she's going to be fine.

909
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:51,077
Oh, thank God. Come
on, let's go see her.

910
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:53,371
I, uh...
I feel just awful.

911
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:54,706
Well, shake it off.
If you knew

912
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:56,082
what the old lady says
behind your back,

913
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:57,542
you would have
done it on purpose.

914
00:31:57,625 --> 00:32:00,211
But let me say, that was a hell
of a tackle for a tenderfoot.

915
00:32:00,503 --> 00:32:04,090
Tenderfoot? Oh, Douglas was quite
the halfback back in college.

916
00:32:04,257 --> 00:32:06,426
You played football, Doug?
How come you never told me?

917
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:08,428
I thought you were
just a nerd fan.

918

(DOUG STAMMERING)

00:32:10,305 --> 00:32:13,183
Yeah. Yeah,
intramurals, scrimmage.

920
00:32:13,266 --> 00:32:14,976
We scrimmaged, the boys.

921
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:18,354
And, you know, I made the all-campus
team a couple times in football.

922
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:19,981
I was an all-conference
nose tackle.

923
00:32:20,064 --> 00:32:22,150
Half the team's
coming in for the wedding.

924
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:24,902
Why don't we have a friendly
game of two-hand touch?

925
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:26,946
You know, the old-timers
versus the groomsmen.

926
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,031
What do you say?

927
00:32:28,156 --> 00:32:30,366
I think that's
quite the invitation, Ed,

928
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,118
but there's
so much going on.

929
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:34,829
I just feel like
there's not enough time.

930
00:32:34,912 --> 00:32:36,623
Oh, what's
the matter, Bic?

931
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:39,042
Afraid of getting your asses
kicked by some old-timers?

932
00:32:43,755 --> 00:32:45,214
I don't think so, Pops.

933
00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:54,265
All things considered, not
that bad for a Shotgun Intro.

934
00:32:54,349 --> 00:32:58,227
Not that bad? I just set
Gretchen's grandmother on fire.

935
00:32:58,311 --> 00:33:01,022
Wrong. We sacrificed Grandma
for the sake of the mission.

936
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:02,148
I feel terrible.

937
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:04,275
Feelings are irrelevant
in the big con.

938
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:06,569
What's important is that
our cover wasn't blown.

939
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:09,238
Every test that we encounter
will be the same, pass or fail.

940

As long as we pass, it
doesn't matter how we do it.

941
00:33:11,282 --> 00:33:13,326
I still can't believe they
actually bought all that

942

have no reason not to.

talking about?

For one thing, it looks like
the entire cast of Goonies

969

grew up and became rapists.

970

looks like

he just broke out of
a federal fucking prison.

What you need to do is keep
it down because he did.

And he raped
a lot of men in there. Yes.

Oh, my God. Oh, Jesus.

975

throw a tux on that son of a bitch,

find anybody better.

a new party trick.

Does he have three testicles?
Yeah, I've got three.

That's neither here nor there.

give me a lot of time, man.

you back seven groomsmen.

You're also working on your first

Do you want to trade?

1021
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:48,022
Hell, yeah. I need to
eat some meat, man.

1022

no trading!

got to be in a wheelchair.

1346
00:48:25,612 --> 00:48:27,531
And it was so sad, Doug.

1347
00:48:27,614 --> 00:48:30,075
Everybody is thinking,
"Why in the hell"

1348
00:48:30,158 --> 00:48:32,327
"would this woman
marry this loser?"

1349
00:48:32,411 --> 00:48:35,914
So, I grab the microphone and
I just get to talking about

1350
00:48:35,998 --> 00:48:40,669
how we climbed the Himalayas,
how we fished for sharks,

1351
00:48:41,003 --> 00:48:43,839
how this guy saved me in
a barroom brawl one time.

1352
00:48:43,922 --> 00:48:45,340
So much bullshit.

1353
00:48:45,674 --> 00:48:50,012
And I look over and I see the bride.
She's got his arm, Doug.

1354
00:48:50,095 --> 00:48:53,140
She's got his arm so tight
and she's glowing.

1355
00:48:53,515 --> 00:48:56,018
Because she's marrying
this amazing guy.

1356
00:48:56,101 --> 00:48:59,104
This man comes up
to me and goes, "Wow."

1357
00:49:00,022 --> 00:49:01,857
"I would pay money"

1358
00:49:02,357 --> 00:49:05,027
"to have somebody talk like
that about me at my wedding."

1359
00:49:06,194 --> 00:49:07,362
Light bulb.

1360
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:11,491
That's the day that this
wedding hustle was born.

1361
00:49:11,575 --> 00:49:14,536
That's the day that I
became The Wedding Ringer.

1362
00:49:16,496 --> 00:49:17,664
(CHUCKLES)

1363
00:49:21,918 --> 00:49:23,045
I, uh...

1364
00:49:23,128 --> 00:49:27,215
Now, I don't want you to think
that I'm some sort of schmuck

1365
00:49:27,299 --> 00:49:28,842
who doesn't have
any friends.

1366
00:49:28,925 --> 00:49:29,926
No.

1367
00:49:30,052 --> 00:49:31,637
You know, my father,

1368
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,639
he was an international
tax attorney, right?

1369
00:49:33,722 --> 00:49:35,974
So, we moved around
all the time.

1370
00:49:37,351 --> 00:49:40,312
I went to 13 different
schools by the eighth grade.

1371
00:49:40,395 --> 00:49:42,064
I lived on four
different continents.

1372
00:49:42,189 --> 00:49:44,733
And after a while
I just figured,

1373
00:49:45,651 --> 00:49:47,277
"Why even make
friends anymore?"

1374
00:49:47,736 --> 00:49:50,364
"I'm just going to have to move, anyway.
What's the point?"

1375
00:49:50,864 --> 00:49:55,452
And then, when my dad died,
I took over the business.

1376
00:49:56,078 --> 00:49:59,081
I was just working so much.
I was working too much.

1377
00:50:00,499 --> 00:50:02,209
Am I a loser?

1378
00:50:04,169 --> 00:50:05,253
No.

to understand, Doug.

Maybe I don't
want to be.

1383
00:50:18,183 --> 00:50:21,436
Maybe I just want someone
to grab a beer with,

1384
00:50:23,188 --> 00:50:26,566

a cool guy trip with.

1385
00:50:27,651 --> 00:50:29,444
You've never been
on a guy trip, Doug?

never done anything like that?

1387

anyone to go with.

it feels really good

1390

looking out for me.

01:30:32,136 --> 01:30:34,806
Good evening. My name
is Bic: Mitchum,

2351
01:30:34,889 --> 01:30:36,224
and,uh,
I just want to say

2352
01:30:36,307 --> 01:30:38,184
that it's an honor
to be here.

2353
01:30:38,643 --> 01:30:40,144
I've delivered many sermons,

2354
01:30:40,228 --> 01:30:41,813
but never
a best man's speech,

2355
01:30:41,896 --> 01:30:43,189
so, please bear with me.

2357
01:30:44,607 --> 01:30:46,234
Doug and I have been
through a lot together.

2358
01:30:46,317 --> 01:30:48,778
Happy times and sad.

2359
01:30:48,861 --> 01:30:50,113
When I was accepted
into the priesthood,

2360
01:30:50,196 --> 01:30:52,615
Doug was there waiting
for me with a huge hug

2361
01:30:52,698 --> 01:30:55,118
and a Bible that was
signed by Cardinal Enders.

2362
01:30:55,201 --> 01:30:56,953
And when his parents,
Merle and Irene,

2363
01:30:57,036 --> 01:30:58,704
passed,
God rest their souls,

2364
01:30:59,372 --> 01:31:00,581
I cried as if
they were my own.

2365
01:31:01,791 --> 01:31:03,459
You know, my grandmother
once told me

2366
01:31:03,543 --> 01:31:06,712
that the true measure
of friendship isn't...

2367
01:31:08,214 --> 01:31:10,550
Isn't how you feel
about someone else.

2368
01:31:12,718 --> 01:31:16,055
It's about how they make
you feel about yourself.

2369
01:31:18,349 --> 01:31:19,475
And, uh...

2370
01:31:20,685 --> 01:31:23,813
I can honestly say that
I've never had a friend

2371
01:31:23,896 --> 01:31:26,399
to make me feel the way
that you have, Doug.

2372

I'm sorry. Uh...

2375
01:31:50,548 --> 01:31:54,093
When Doug called me and told
me that he wanted to propose,

2376
01:31:56,012 --> 01:31:59,849
I was nervous. I was probably
just as nervous as he was.

2377
01:32:01,017 --> 01:32:03,102
And I remember asking him,

2378
01:32:04,854 --> 01:32:06,939
"Are you sure
she's 'the one'?"

2379
01:32:12,737 --> 01:32:13,738

2380
