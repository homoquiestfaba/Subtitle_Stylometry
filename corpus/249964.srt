1
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:19,149
Mr. Roberts.

2
00:02:23,392 --> 00:02:28,728
<i>I am doomed to
remember a boy with a wrecked voice.</i>

3
00:02:28,797 --> 00:02:31,698
<i>Not because of his voice
or because he was...</i>

4
00:02:31,767 --> 00:02:34,201
<i>the smallest person
I ever knew...</i>

5
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:38,000
<i>or even because he was
the instrument of my mother's death,</i>

6
00:02:38,073 --> 00:02:41,702
<i>but because he is the reason
I believe in God.</i>

7
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,876
<i>What faith I have,
I owe to Simon Birch,</i>

8
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:52,512
<i>the boy I grew up with
in Gravestown, Maine.</i>

9
00:02:52,588 --> 00:02:55,614
<i>It is Simon that
made me a believer.</i>

10
00:02:57,993 --> 00:03:00,427
Hi, Mr. Roberts!

11
00:03:42,537 --> 00:03:44,979
And will...

12
00:03:45,014 --> 00:03:51,857
strengthen your heart all ye
that will hope in the Lord.

13
00:04:24,261 --> 00:04:27,025
I'm gonna leave you alone
with your thoughts now.

14
00:04:27,098 --> 00:04:30,659
And when I come back
we'll talk about...

15
00:04:30,735 --> 00:04:32,965
what we've just read.

16
00:04:33,037 --> 00:04:38,771
Silently and seriously,

17
00:04:39,872 --> 00:04:42,422
that's how I want you to think.

18
00:04:43,414 --> 00:04:45,473
<i>Our Sunday school teacher
was an unhappy woman...</i>

19
00:04:45,549 --> 00:04:47,676
<i>by the name of Miss Leavey.</i>

20
00:04:47,752 --> 00:04:52,382
<i>Her name suited her perfectly,
as she was always leaving class.</i>

21
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,197
He's so cute.

22
00:05:07,471 --> 00:05:11,271
<i>Simon Birch was so tiny
that we loved to pick him up.</i>

23
00:05:11,342 --> 00:05:13,276
Hey, put me down.

24
00:05:13,344 --> 00:05:15,710
<i>In truth, we couldn't resist
picking him up.</i>

25
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,941
<i>We thought it was a miracle
how little he weighed.</i>

26
00:05:18,015 --> 00:05:20,313
Cut it out,
you assholes.

27
00:05:20,384 --> 00:05:22,477
Hey, no tickling.

28
00:05:32,895 --> 00:05:34,893
I'm warning you.

29
00:05:36,484 --> 00:05:38,010
Pass him to me!

30
00:05:38,102 --> 00:05:40,627
Simon Birch?

31
00:05:40,705 --> 00:05:42,969
Down!

32
00:05:49,647 --> 00:05:51,911
<i>I never understood
Miss Leavey's reaction.</i>

33
00:05:51,982 --> 00:05:54,507
<i>Did she think Simon
climbed up there on his own?</i>

34
00:05:54,585 --> 00:05:57,986
<i>Or that leaving us alone with our
thoughts had so empowered us that...</i>

35
00:05:58,055 --> 00:06:01,081
<i>Simon was levitating up
to heaven?</i>

36
00:06:01,158 --> 00:06:05,595
<i>But Simon was no rat.
As vividly as any story in the Bible,</i>

37
00:06:05,663 --> 00:06:07,995
<i>Simon showed us what
a martyr was.</i>

38
00:06:08,232 --> 00:06:11,463
<i>Simon Birch
was the smallest delivery...</i>

39
00:06:11,535 --> 00:06:14,732
<i>every recorded in the history
of Gravestown Memorial Hospital.</i>

40
00:06:14,805 --> 00:06:16,739
Okay, Mrs. Birch...

41
00:06:16,807 --> 00:06:19,367
the nurse is gonna give you
a shot here to help with the pain...

42
00:06:19,443 --> 00:06:22,708
- and then we'll get started.
- Okay.

43
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:31,778
Gesundheit!

44
00:06:31,856 --> 00:06:34,723
- Ooh!
- Ooh!
- Doctor!

45
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,367
Oh-Oh, dear.

46
00:06:46,704 --> 00:06:48,638
Oh.

47
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:53,143
<i>Simon's father owned
the Birch Granite Company.</i>

48
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,270
<i>Mr. Birch was a big believer
in the rock.</i>

49
00:06:56,347 --> 00:06:59,475
<i>And just about everything
in their house was made from granite,</i>

50
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,745
including Mr. Birch.

51
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,294
Eh...

52
00:07:13,323 --> 00:07:16,129
Excuse us, please. Excuse us.

53
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,566
Excuse us, please.
Heh!

54
00:07:21,105 --> 00:07:23,266
<i>Along with
just about everything else...</i>

55
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,207
<i>Simon was born
with an undersized heart.</i>

56
00:07:26,277 --> 00:07:28,973
<i>The prognosis wasn't good,
and Dr. Wells warned...</i>

57
00:07:29,046 --> 00:07:32,311
<i>the Birches that Simon probably
wouldn't last through the night.</i>

58
00:07:32,383 --> 00:07:34,817
Fit-Fit right there
in the palm of my hand.

59
00:07:34,885 --> 00:07:37,285
<i>But he did.</i>

60
00:07:37,354 --> 00:07:40,653
<i>Still, the complication seemed
too great, and Dr. Wells warned...</i>

61
00:07:40,724 --> 00:07:43,989
<i>the Birches that Simon probably
wouldn't last through the week.</i>

62
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:46,859
<i>But he did.</i>

63
00:08:01,745 --> 00:08:05,909
<i>The Birches didn't know what to make of
their peculiar, little disappointment.</i>

64
00:08:05,983 --> 00:08:09,441
<i>So they made nothing
of it at all.</i>

65
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,454
I'm going to work.

66
00:08:16,093 --> 00:08:18,027
<i>Weeks turned into months.</i>

67
00:08:20,698 --> 00:08:24,532
<i>And months
turned into years.</i>

68
00:08:24,602 --> 00:08:26,661
Come on, we're late.

69
00:08:26,737 --> 00:08:29,399
No, you're late.
I'm just riding with you.

70
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:36,509
<i>The doctors proclaimed Simon a miracle.</i>

71
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,676
<i>And he was quick to remind any of us
if we forgot.</i>

72
00:08:40,751 --> 00:08:43,413
Not so fast. Slow down.

73
00:08:43,487 --> 00:08:46,547
- I'm a miracle, you know.
- Yeah. Yeah.

74
00:08:46,624 --> 00:08:49,752
<i>But even miracles
can't go on forever.</i>

75
00:08:49,827 --> 00:08:54,287
<i>And although we never talked about it,
it was never far from our minds.</i>

76
00:08:54,365 --> 00:08:56,458
Here they come,

77
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:59,001
the Wenteworth bastard
and his granite mouse.

78
00:08:59,069 --> 00:09:03,836
Hey, Birch, nice
sidecar. What you use? A matchbox?

79
00:09:04,883 --> 00:09:06,001
Have a nice day.

80
00:09:06,076 --> 00:09:08,943
Goddamn kids got no respect
these days.

81
00:09:12,448 --> 00:09:13,882
It's another beautiful...

82
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:16,249
autumn day friends,
and so sit back, relax...

83
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,880
and so let "Big Daddy"
Dave Barton do the driving...

84
00:09:18,956 --> 00:09:22,892
as we cruise on down
the highway of hits here on WGV...

85
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,894
the sound of Gravestown.

86
00:09:24,962 --> 00:09:28,022
Let's click on the turnstiles
of our wax files.

87
00:09:28,098 --> 00:09:31,329
This one goes out
to our Gravestown Tigers.

88
00:09:34,905 --> 00:09:38,204
<i>Baseball is a lot
like life for a 12-year-old.</i>

89
00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:41,301
<i>You spent most of your time
waiting for the excitement to begin...</i>

90
00:09:41,378 --> 00:09:44,779
<i>only to discover later
that it's already past you by.</i>

91
00:09:44,848 --> 00:09:47,578
Think out there, boys.
Okay? When you're out there, think!

92
00:09:47,651 --> 00:09:51,644
- I was just thinking.
- Yeah?

93
00:09:51,722 --> 00:09:55,158
- Last year we played
in the squirt league, right?
- Uh-huh.

94
00:09:55,225 --> 00:09:58,353
- And this year we're in the peewees.
- So?

95
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:01,421
Do they want us
to play baseball or urinate?

96
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:07,438
Anyway,
I was just thinking.

97
00:10:07,571 --> 00:10:11,473
<i>My mom got pregnant
during her senior year at high school.</i>

98
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:14,807
<i>The fact that she refused
to divulge my father's identity...</i>

99
00:10:14,878 --> 00:10:17,142
- <i>upgraded it to a full-fledged scandal.</i>
- Hi, Joe!

100
00:10:19,716 --> 00:10:21,650
Hi, Miss Wenteworth.

101
00:10:21,718 --> 00:10:23,743
Hi, Simon.

102
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:26,915
How's my little doll?

103
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,550
Your mother has the best breasts
of all the mothers.

104
00:10:29,626 --> 00:10:31,890
- Yeah.
- And she smells the best too.

105
00:10:31,962 --> 00:10:34,123
- I know.
- She's so sexy that...

106
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:36,166
sometimes I forget
she's someone's mother.

107
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:39,259
- Okay! Okay!
- I was just being honest.

108
00:10:39,336 --> 00:10:41,429
Well, what if I said
the same thing about your mother?

109
00:10:41,505 --> 00:10:43,439
I'd have you committed.

110
00:10:43,507 --> 00:10:46,340
<i>Nobody knew her secret. Not even me.</i>

111
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,937
- And I wouldn't know it to this day,
if it wasn't for Simon Birch.
- Ooh!

112
00:10:50,013 --> 00:10:52,641
Birch, on deck.

113
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,481
Go get 'em, Simon.

114
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:13,027
You go, Simon.
You'll be wonderful.

115
00:11:13,103 --> 00:11:15,128
<i>Simon loved baseball.</i>

116
00:11:15,205 --> 00:11:17,230
<i>I'm not sure why.</i>

117
00:11:18,976 --> 00:11:22,139
<i>He rarely got to play and when he did,
he was ordered not to swing.</i>

118
00:11:22,212 --> 00:11:25,306
<i>His strike zone
was minuscule.</i>

119
00:11:25,382 --> 00:11:27,577
Holy shit!

120
00:11:27,651 --> 00:11:29,585
Ha! Look at this kid.

121
00:11:29,653 --> 00:11:32,679
- It's the friggin' hobbit.
- Nah, it's Thumbelina.

122
00:11:32,756 --> 00:11:37,386
- You're both wrong.
It's a pinch-hitting munchkin.
- Okay, all right.

123
00:11:37,461 --> 00:11:41,056
- Let's play ball.
Do your thing, Simon.

124
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:44,567
- Show 'em how it's done.
- Okay, Foster, he's yours.

125
00:11:48,405 --> 00:11:50,930
- 0-1.
- Good eye, Birch.

126
00:11:51,008 --> 00:11:53,272
- Good eye, son.
- Foster, easy.

127
00:11:53,343 --> 00:11:57,279
- You don't need your fastball
on this guy.

128
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:01,918
- 0-2.
- All right. Lay it in easy, now.

129
00:12:01,985 --> 00:12:04,146
I'm trying. Shit!

130
00:12:10,928 --> 00:12:14,193
- Zero, three.
- That was great!

131
00:12:14,264 --> 00:12:17,256
- Way to watch.
- Thank you, Miss Wenteworth.

132
00:12:19,903 --> 00:12:22,667
All right. Let's go Foster,
buddy. Right in there, buddy.

133
00:12:22,739 --> 00:12:25,572
- Ball four!
- Shit!

134
00:12:25,642 --> 00:12:29,078
Take your base.

135
00:12:33,684 --> 00:12:36,585
- Whoa!
- Take a look at that!

136
00:12:36,653 --> 00:12:38,587
Be waiting for you next time.

137
00:12:38,655 --> 00:12:40,953
Your head's bigger
than your strike zone, pal.

138
00:12:43,193 --> 00:12:46,287
<i>Pitchers always threatened
to hit Simon, but it rarely happened.</i>

139
00:12:46,363 --> 00:12:48,627
<i>I think they were afraid
of killing him.</i>

140
00:12:50,534 --> 00:12:53,162
Hi! How's it going?

141
00:13:10,572 --> 00:13:12,079
Six, seven,

142
00:13:12,155 --> 00:13:14,248
eight, nine, ten.

143
00:13:23,463 --> 00:13:25,300
Timber-r-r!

144
00:13:33,114 --> 00:13:34,610
Race you to the quarry.

145
00:13:35,556 --> 00:13:38,114
I'm gonna beat you. I know a shortcut.

146
00:13:38,181 --> 00:13:39,799
No, you don't.

147
00:13:45,622 --> 00:13:47,988
One year good luck.

148
00:13:48,058 --> 00:13:49,745
One year good luck.

149
00:14:07,868 --> 00:14:08,873
Told you I knew a shortcut.

150
00:14:14,217 --> 00:14:16,913
- Oh, man, that's cold.
- It's freezing.

151
00:14:19,013 --> 00:14:20,980
- Oh, man, my balls
just turned into marbles.

152
00:14:21,058 --> 00:14:24,619
My balls just turned
into BBs.

153
00:14:41,845 --> 00:14:44,245
- Time me.
- Simon!

154
00:14:44,314 --> 00:14:46,373
- Please!
- Why does it matter how long...

155
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:49,078
- you can hold your breath?
- I don't know. It just does.

156
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,820
One Mississippi.
Two Mississippi.

157
00:14:57,894 --> 00:15:01,057
Three Mississippi.
Four Mississippi.

158
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:07,529
Joe.

159
00:15:11,641 --> 00:15:13,905
- Hi, Joe!
- Hi, Ann.

160
00:15:13,977 --> 00:15:16,912
Hi, Marjorie!
What are you guys up to?

161
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,108
- No good.
- Where's Simon?

162
00:15:20,183 --> 00:15:22,651
He's around.

163
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:25,449
- He's so adorable.
- Like a little doll.

164
00:15:25,522 --> 00:15:27,820
Time! Time! Time!

165
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,421
- Thirty Mississippi.
- Thirty Mississippi?

166
00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:36,296
Thirty Mississippi?
I counted 34 Mississippi.

167
00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:38,732
You know, why do you have me count it
if you are just gonna count yourself?

168
00:15:38,802 --> 00:15:40,770
I want a verification.

169
00:15:40,837 --> 00:15:44,466
Hi, Simon.

170
00:15:49,898 --> 00:15:51,472
When did they get here?

171
00:15:51,548 --> 00:15:54,984
- About 14 Mississippi.
- Marjorie's got breasts.

172
00:15:55,051 --> 00:15:58,646
- Yeah.
- And soon they'll be boobs.

173
00:15:58,722 --> 00:16:00,657
- I know.
- Maybe she'll let us
touch them sometime,

174
00:16:00,657 --> 00:16:02,989
- I know.
- Maybe she'll let us
touch them sometime,

175
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:06,358
- if we paid her.
- Why don't you ask her?

176
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:09,227
- Oh, uh, Marjorie?
- Stop it! Stop it!

177
00:16:09,298 --> 00:16:11,789
Uh, Simon has a question
for you.

178
00:16:11,868 --> 00:16:14,803
- What is it, Simon?
- Nothing. Good-bye.

179
00:16:14,871 --> 00:16:18,568
He wants to know, uh,
maybe if he paid you...

180
00:16:18,641 --> 00:16:21,075
could he touch your bre...

181
00:16:21,144 --> 00:16:24,705
- He wants to know
if he could touch your bre...
- Quiet! Okay?

182
00:16:24,781 --> 00:16:27,978
He wants to know if...

183
00:16:28,051 --> 00:16:32,647
- He wants to know...
He just wants to know...

184
00:16:35,058 --> 00:16:38,084
- I think Marjorie likes you.
- She likes you.

185
00:16:38,161 --> 00:16:42,791
- She said you were cute.
- She means cute
like a baby turtle is cute.

186
00:16:42,865 --> 00:16:45,561
- Girls don't kiss baby turtles.
- How do you know?

187
00:16:45,635 --> 00:16:49,401
I just know.
If you were me,

188
00:16:49,472 --> 00:16:52,839
you'd know too.

189
00:17:14,764 --> 00:17:16,755
But things
will be different...

190
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:18,767
once God makes me
a hero.

191
00:17:18,835 --> 00:17:21,668
You know, you shouldn't talk
about this hero stuff, Simon.

192
00:17:21,738 --> 00:17:24,730
- Why not?
- Because it's weird.

193
00:17:24,807 --> 00:17:28,743
- The other kids tease you
enough as it is.
- I don't care. It's the truth.

194
00:17:28,811 --> 00:17:31,609
But you don't have
any proof.

195
00:17:31,681 --> 00:17:35,583
I don't need proof.
I have faith.

196
00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:40,384
Your problem is that
you have no faith.

197
00:17:40,456 --> 00:17:44,017
I got faith.
I just want proof to back it up.

198
00:17:47,697 --> 00:17:50,996
<i>We lived
in my grandmother's house,
a monster of a place.</i>

199
00:17:51,067 --> 00:17:53,661
- <i>It was frequently mistaken
for the Gravestown Inn.</i>
- Shoo! Shoo!

200
00:17:53,736 --> 00:17:55,670
- It's not an inn.
- <i>The fact that never ceased...</i>

201
00:17:55,738 --> 00:17:57,899
<i>to irritate my grandmother.</i>

202
00:17:57,974 --> 00:18:02,638
<i>But then again, most everything
irritated my grandmother.</i>

203
00:18:02,712 --> 00:18:04,976
- Hi, Grandmother.
- Slow down.

204
00:18:05,047 --> 00:18:07,379
<i>Particularly Simon Birch.</i>

205
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:11,284
- Hi, ladies!
- That creature.

206
00:18:11,354 --> 00:18:14,755
<i>But that's not to say
that she didn't have her kind side.</i>

207
00:18:14,824 --> 00:18:18,726
<i>In fact, when our maid Hildie got cancer
and had to have her leg removed,</i>

208
00:18:18,795 --> 00:18:20,786
<i>Grandmother hired
two more maids,</i>

209
00:18:20,863 --> 00:18:22,854
<i>one just to look
after Hildie.</i>

210
00:18:22,932 --> 00:18:25,230
<i>Hildie never worked
another day in her life.</i>

211
00:18:25,301 --> 00:18:28,828
<i>And as the years went on, she even
began to look like my grandmother...</i>

212
00:18:28,905 --> 00:18:33,808
- <i>and not like a maid at all.</i>
- That child is positively...

213
00:18:33,876 --> 00:18:36,276
- unnatural.
- Most peculiar.

214
00:18:36,345 --> 00:18:39,246
- And his voice like...
- A mouse.

215
00:18:39,315 --> 00:18:42,148
More than one.
Like mice.

216
00:18:42,218 --> 00:18:46,382
- Strangled mice.
- Strangled mice.

217
00:18:46,455 --> 00:18:49,219
Very good, Hildie.

218
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,756
Hello, everyone!

219
00:18:54,463 --> 00:18:56,055
What's wrong with you?

220
00:18:56,132 --> 00:18:58,566
- There's nothing wrong with me.
- Hi, Mom.

221
00:18:58,634 --> 00:19:03,799
- Somethin's goin' on.
- Yes, something's going on.
You look all... shiny.

222
00:19:03,873 --> 00:19:07,673
Well, I met a man
on the train.

223
00:19:09,145 --> 00:19:11,705
- The good 'ol Boston and Maine.
- You're pregnant?

224
00:19:11,781 --> 00:19:13,976
Mother, I just met him.

225
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,610
The last time you met a man
on the Boston and Maine,

226
00:19:16,686 --> 00:19:19,655
- you came home pregnant.
- Mother.

227
00:19:19,722 --> 00:19:23,055
- Am I gonna have a little brother?
- Everyone, please.

228
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,958
I've only spoken with him,
but I like him very much.

229
00:19:26,028 --> 00:19:29,088
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

230
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:34,000
So, when do we get to meet
this Mr. Wonderful?

231
00:19:37,273 --> 00:19:39,764
Good Lord.

232
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:44,035
Yolanda!

233
00:19:44,113 --> 00:19:47,913
Hey, wait up! Wait for me!
I wanna see too.

234
00:19:47,984 --> 00:19:50,009
Simon Birch, get away
from there. You'll scare him off.

235
00:19:50,086 --> 00:19:52,611
I can't see.
I can't see.

236
00:20:00,263 --> 00:20:03,027
- Hello, Ben.
- Hello, Rebecca.

237
00:20:03,099 --> 00:20:05,260
- We were just talking about you.
- Really?

238
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:07,529
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

239
00:20:09,572 --> 00:20:11,904
You must be Simon...

240
00:20:11,974 --> 00:20:13,965
and that would make
you Joe?

241
00:20:14,043 --> 00:20:18,070
Nice to meet ya. I heard all about you
from your mom on the train.

242
00:20:18,147 --> 00:20:20,615
- What's in the bag?
- Joseph!

243
00:20:20,683 --> 00:20:25,017
Oh, no, no, that's okay. Uh, as
a matter of fact, Joe, this is
something that I bought for you.

244
00:20:25,087 --> 00:20:28,648
<i>My mother's dates
were always bringing me presents...</i>

245
00:20:28,724 --> 00:20:32,820
<i>in their feeble attempts to win me over,
but it never worked.</i>

246
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:36,194
- So, Joseph, what do you say?
- Nice bag.

247
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,827
I tell you what.
Um, why don't I take this...

248
00:20:41,904 --> 00:20:44,429
and just put it right over here
on this table.

249
00:20:44,507 --> 00:20:47,670
And then you can take a look
at it if you feel like.

250
00:20:49,612 --> 00:20:52,274
It's probably
some stupid Legos or something.

251
00:20:52,348 --> 00:20:55,374
Oh, um, could you guys
do me a favor?

252
00:20:55,451 --> 00:20:57,385
Uh, just keep an eye
on the bag for me.

253
00:20:57,453 --> 00:21:00,320
And, uh, give me a holler
if it moves.

254
00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:02,721
Okay?

255
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:05,352
Thanks.

256
00:21:14,403 --> 00:21:16,337
You're a drama teacher?

257
00:21:16,405 --> 00:21:20,341
- They teach that?
- Well, what I try and do,
Mrs. Wenteworth,

258
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:23,378
is-is use the theater to get students
to express themselves...

259
00:21:23,446 --> 00:21:27,109
- in ways they normally couldn't.
- How do you do that?

260
00:21:27,183 --> 00:21:30,812
Well, one way that I found
works well is by introducing props.

261
00:21:30,886 --> 00:21:36,381
- Young people seem to respond to that.
- What kind of props?

262
00:21:36,459 --> 00:21:39,053
Well, kind of like the one
I just left out there in the hall.

263
00:21:39,128 --> 00:21:43,360
Matter of fact, there could be a little
drama unfolding just as we speak.

264
00:21:43,432 --> 00:21:45,832
We'll soon see.

265
00:21:50,764 --> 00:21:52,173
Oh, boy, that's a lot of peas.

266
00:21:53,476 --> 00:21:56,274
Why don't I just put
a few of these back here?

267
00:21:56,345 --> 00:22:00,042
I don't need that
many peas.

268
00:22:09,592 --> 00:22:11,526
- Did you see that?
- What?

269
00:22:11,594 --> 00:22:14,688
- I think it moved.
- You're imagining it.

270
00:22:17,033 --> 00:22:20,196
- Maybe it's a puppy.
- Not unless it's a dead puppy.

271
00:22:20,269 --> 00:22:24,205
Yeah. He wouldn't bring
a dead puppy on the first date.

272
00:22:24,273 --> 00:22:26,207
It's something else.

273
00:22:29,945 --> 00:22:33,073
I bet he's just putting us on.
I bet there's nothing even in there.

274
00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:35,549
He's just playing a joke on us.
Go ahead and open it.

275
00:22:35,618 --> 00:22:37,813
- I'm not opening it.
- Don't you wanna see what's inside?

276
00:22:37,887 --> 00:22:40,754
What I want to do and what I do
are two separate things.

277
00:22:40,823 --> 00:22:45,226
If we all went around doing what we
wanted all the time, there'd be chaos.

278
00:22:45,294 --> 00:22:47,228
You open it.

279
00:23:11,187 --> 00:23:14,452
- The prop.
- What was that?

280
00:23:14,523 --> 00:23:17,117
It's a monster!

281
00:23:19,695 --> 00:23:22,027
- You're okay.
- Help!
- Isn't he terrific?

282
00:23:22,098 --> 00:23:24,498
- He's going to eat us.
- You're okay.
It's just an armadillo.

283
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:29,334
- A what?
- It's a stuffed armadillo. See?

284
00:23:29,405 --> 00:23:32,033
I picked it up on my way
through San Antonio last week.

285
00:23:37,113 --> 00:23:40,378
It's not that bad
once you get used to it.

286
00:23:40,449 --> 00:23:42,713
What do you think, Joe?

287
00:23:42,785 --> 00:23:46,186
- I don't want it.
- Can I have it?

288
00:23:46,255 --> 00:23:49,019
Well, why don't you, uh,
uh, give it a chance!

289
00:23:50,226 --> 00:23:53,889
Maybe it'll grow on you.

290
00:24:04,807 --> 00:24:07,275
So Shirley Temple
says to Senator McCarthy...

291
00:24:07,343 --> 00:24:11,439
- I didn't say, "commie,"
I said, "Moppie."

292
00:24:11,514 --> 00:24:13,948
Uh, Mom?
Can Simon sleep over?

293
00:24:14,016 --> 00:24:15,950
We wanna spend the night out
under the stars.

294
00:24:16,018 --> 00:24:18,316
Sure, honey, as long as it's
all right with Simon's parents.

295
00:24:18,387 --> 00:24:21,720
- They don't care.
- Will you do me a favor anyway
and call them?

296
00:24:46,282 --> 00:24:49,046
- Yeah?
- Can I sleep over at Joe's tonight?

297
00:24:49,118 --> 00:24:54,351
- I don't care.
- I'm ready for my good-night kisses.

298
00:24:54,423 --> 00:24:56,618
- Oh, Mom.
- Me first! Me first!

299
00:24:56,692 --> 00:24:59,456
Oh, don't you "oh, Mom" me.
Get up here. Mm-whaa!

300
00:25:04,233 --> 00:25:06,929
Good night, honey.
Love you.

301
00:25:07,003 --> 00:25:08,994
Simon, isn't it
a little cool outside?

302
00:25:09,071 --> 00:25:11,972
Don't you think
you need a sweater?

303
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:14,339
It's hard to find sweaters
my size.

304
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:18,710
They have to make them special
and my dad says they're too expensive.

305
00:25:22,084 --> 00:25:23,847
Here.

306
00:25:25,421 --> 00:25:28,686
- How about that?
- Thank you, Miss Wenteworth.

307
00:25:28,758 --> 00:25:31,556
- Mm. Love you.
- Good night, Ben Goodrich!

308
00:25:31,627 --> 00:25:34,892
Bonsoir Monsieur Birch.

309
00:25:34,964 --> 00:25:37,057
Buenas noches,
Senor Wenteworth.

310
00:25:39,502 --> 00:25:41,436
You boys stay in the yard.

311
00:25:41,504 --> 00:25:43,972
I like him.

312
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,338
I don't.

313
00:25:46,409 --> 00:25:48,843
Maybe God sent him
to be your father.

314
00:25:48,911 --> 00:25:52,039
God sent me a screwball
with an armadillo?

315
00:25:52,114 --> 00:25:55,311
God has a plan for everyone,
including Ben Goodrich.

316
00:25:59,221 --> 00:26:03,123
Well, he's not
my father.

317
00:26:03,192 --> 00:26:05,160
My real father
is out there somewhere.

318
00:26:05,227 --> 00:26:07,695
Mr. Hanson has your eyes.

319
00:26:07,763 --> 00:26:10,527
- The shop teacher?
- And he's a lefty, like you.

320
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,091
That's 'cause he chopped off
his right thumb with the table saw.

321
00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:16,605
I didn't say
he was a natural lefty.

322
00:26:16,672 --> 00:26:19,232
Maybe he chopped off his thumb
on purpose to show your mother...

323
00:26:19,308 --> 00:26:22,175
how much he loved her,
like Van Gogh with his ear.

324
00:26:22,244 --> 00:26:26,544
I can't see my mom being attracted
to a metal shop teacher.

325
00:26:26,616 --> 00:26:29,050
Art or English maybe,
but not metal shop.

326
00:26:29,118 --> 00:26:33,282
I don't understand
why she doesn't just tell you.

327
00:26:33,356 --> 00:26:37,315
You're already a bastard.
You might as well be an enlightened one.

328
00:26:37,393 --> 00:26:40,885
- She said she'd tell me
when I'm old enough.
- When's that?

329
00:26:40,963 --> 00:26:44,797
I don't know.
Soon, I hope.

330
00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:52,801
<i>Things were getting
serious between my mother...</i>

331
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:55,469
<i>and the armadillo-wielding
Ben Goodrich,</i>

332
00:26:55,678 --> 00:26:59,341
<i>enough so that one Sunday
she brought him with us to church.</i>

333
00:27:22,038 --> 00:27:24,768
Hi, Joe! Hi, Miss Wenteworth!
Hi, Ben Goodrich!

334
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,831
Hi, Simon!

335
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:29,343
I have something
for you.

336
00:27:29,412 --> 00:27:32,438
- You made that for me?
- I did indeed, my little doll.

337
00:27:32,515 --> 00:27:36,576
I think it's gonna be getting cool
pretty soon and you need to have...

338
00:27:36,652 --> 00:27:41,089
a beautiful sweater
just for you.

339
00:27:41,157 --> 00:27:44,558
Hopefully, a good fit.

340
00:27:44,627 --> 00:27:46,561
So, let's see?

341
00:27:46,629 --> 00:27:50,429
Oops!
Oh, my goodness.

342
00:27:50,499 --> 00:27:52,467
Well,

343
00:27:52,535 --> 00:27:56,471
what a very long
piece of yarn.

344
00:27:56,539 --> 00:27:59,804
- He looks like a hobo.
- It's perfect.

345
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:01,809
Just like you.

346
00:28:03,512 --> 00:28:07,380
Come on.

347
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:10,385
Blessed is he
whose transgression is forgiven,

348
00:28:10,453 --> 00:28:12,421
whose sin is covered.

349
00:28:12,488 --> 00:28:15,423
I said I will confess
my transgressions unto the Lord...

350
00:28:15,491 --> 00:28:19,791
and Thou forgave us
the inequity of my sin.

351
00:28:19,862 --> 00:28:22,626
- The Word of the Lord.
- Thanks be to God.

352
00:28:22,698 --> 00:28:25,792
I'd like to take a few minutes
to discuss some...

353
00:28:25,868 --> 00:28:28,098
of the upcoming activities
on the church calendar.

354
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:31,697
Here we go.

355
00:28:31,774 --> 00:28:35,437
- What's wrong, Simon?
- Who knows what God thinks
about current events?

356
00:28:35,511 --> 00:28:40,210
- Does someone have a question?
- Uh, no, sir.

357
00:28:40,282 --> 00:28:43,046
Uh, Your Honor, no...

358
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:46,577
Father, thank you.
No, sir.

359
00:28:46,655 --> 00:28:50,147
It's always nice to see
new faces in the congregation.

360
00:28:50,226 --> 00:28:52,524
Uh, I'd like
to invite them...

361
00:28:52,595 --> 00:28:55,257
to join my wife and children
and, uh, myself...

362
00:28:55,331 --> 00:28:57,663
for coffee and donuts
downstairs after the service.

363
00:28:57,733 --> 00:29:02,932
- What does coffee and donuts
have to do with God?
- Simon Birch, be quiet.

364
00:29:03,005 --> 00:29:06,099
Simon, is there something you'd like
to share with the rest of us?

365
00:29:09,245 --> 00:29:13,511
I said, "What does coffee and donuts
have to do with God?"

366
00:29:13,582 --> 00:29:19,282
They're merely refreshments
so people can socialize and, uh,
discuss the upcoming activities.

367
00:29:19,355 --> 00:29:22,381
Whoever said that church needs
a continental breakfast?

368
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:25,859
- Simon!
- I doubt that God is interested
in our church activities.

369
00:29:25,928 --> 00:29:29,386
- Simon!
- If God has made the church
bake sale our priority,

370
00:29:29,465 --> 00:29:32,400
then I'd say we're all
in a lot of trouble.

371
00:29:32,468 --> 00:29:34,993
Simon, that is enough!

372
00:29:41,857 --> 00:29:42,872
Children may be excused...

373
00:29:42,945 --> 00:29:45,573
to go to Sunday school.

374
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:51,178
- Simon?
- Yes, ma'am?

375
00:29:51,253 --> 00:29:54,848
Don't you feel that you owe
Reverend Russell an apology?

376
00:29:57,059 --> 00:29:59,823
- Simon?
- I'm thinking.

377
00:29:59,895 --> 00:30:01,863
Well, you can just sit there
and think...

378
00:30:01,931 --> 00:30:04,991
until you apologize
to poor Reverend Russell.

379
00:30:05,067 --> 00:30:07,763
Class dismissed.

380
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:11,966
Joe, dismissed.

381
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:14,976
- See you later, alligator.
- After a while, crocodile.

382
00:30:17,313 --> 00:30:19,873
- Reverend Russell.
- Go on outside, Joe.

383
00:30:19,949 --> 00:30:22,713
- He didn't mean anything.
- Stop making excuses for him.

384
00:30:22,785 --> 00:30:24,810
If Simon is going to be
a member of our congregation,

385
00:30:24,887 --> 00:30:26,946
he has to start behaving
like a normal person.

386
00:30:27,022 --> 00:30:31,322
- He is a normal person.
- Simon Birch is not a normal person.

387
00:30:34,029 --> 00:30:36,190
Just go on outside, Joe.

388
00:30:40,135 --> 00:30:43,229
Well...

389
00:30:44,907 --> 00:30:47,501
are we, uh, ready
to apologize?

390
00:30:47,576 --> 00:30:51,512
He's thinking
about it.

391
00:30:53,616 --> 00:30:55,550
Simon.

392
00:30:55,618 --> 00:30:58,644
What do you think you're doing
sitting in a corner?

393
00:30:58,721 --> 00:31:02,452
- Thinking about God.
- In a corner?

394
00:31:02,524 --> 00:31:05,118
Faith is not
in a floor plan.

395
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:17,104
- Keep him here.
- But for how long?

396
00:31:18,307 --> 00:31:20,741
As long as it takes.

397
00:31:20,809 --> 00:31:24,336
- Mom.
- Hi, honey. Where's Simon?

398
00:31:26,015 --> 00:31:27,949
Didn't your mother
ever teach you...

399
00:31:28,017 --> 00:31:30,781
how to keep quiet
during mass?

400
00:31:32,588 --> 00:31:36,046
Tsk. What am I saying?

401
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:39,856
Of course she didn't.

402
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:44,857
Your parents don't go to church,
do they, Simon?

403
00:31:46,835 --> 00:31:49,702
See, that's because
they don't belong here.

404
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,274
And neither do you.

405
00:31:54,343 --> 00:31:56,937
Speaking out of turn,
disrupting the class,

406
00:31:57,012 --> 00:32:01,278
telling the other children that...
that God has a special plan for you.

407
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:04,286
What kind of nonsense is this?

408
00:32:04,419 --> 00:32:07,286
And what kind of nonsense is this?

409
00:32:07,355 --> 00:32:09,289
- Hello, Rebecca.
- Come on, Simon.

410
00:32:09,357 --> 00:32:11,348
I was just... No, wait.
I was...

411
00:32:11,426 --> 00:32:13,860
- Out.
- I was teaching him a lesson.

412
00:32:13,928 --> 00:32:17,659
- And what lesson is that?
Humiliation?
- Oh, man, this is so boss.

413
00:32:17,732 --> 00:32:20,496
- This is all my fault.
- Hey, don't take all the credit.
She's my mom.

414
00:32:20,568 --> 00:32:23,196
Telling the children that he's
some kind of hero. That he's...

415
00:32:23,271 --> 00:32:27,037
- That he's God's instrument.
- And who's to say he isn't?

416
00:32:27,108 --> 00:32:29,133
- Who do you think would win
in a fight?
- Good question.

417
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:32,805
Miss Leavey is meaner, but she's
a smoker. Your mom could outlast her.

418
00:32:32,881 --> 00:32:35,281
We can't have him
talking that way.

419
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,375
It frightens
the other children.

420
00:32:37,452 --> 00:32:39,818
Oh, I think it's you
it frightens, Miss Leavey.

421
00:32:39,888 --> 00:32:43,187
What? Why would I be frightened
of little Simon Birch?

422
00:32:43,258 --> 00:32:46,887
Because that child has more faith
than you'll ever know.

423
00:32:46,961 --> 00:32:50,419
- Ahh!
- Oh, goodness gracious.

424
00:32:50,498 --> 00:32:52,830
Come on, you two.

425
00:32:55,904 --> 00:32:58,839
Come on, boys.
Let's go find Ben.

426
00:33:03,345 --> 00:33:06,781
- My jacket!
- Oh, that's okay, Simon.
I'll get it for you.

427
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:20,721
Thank you,
Miss Wenteworth.

428
00:33:20,795 --> 00:33:23,821
You know what, Simon?
Thank you.

429
00:33:46,087 --> 00:33:49,818
Strike three!
You're out, batter.

430
00:33:49,891 --> 00:33:54,055
<i>October 30, 1964.</i>

431
00:33:54,129 --> 00:33:57,565
<i>Our team was getting beaten
badly by Horseshoe Bay.</i>

432
00:33:57,632 --> 00:34:00,396
<i>This wasn't an altogether
uncommon occurrence,</i>

433
00:34:00,468 --> 00:34:03,960
<i>but on this particular day,
for no particular reason,</i>

434
00:34:04,038 --> 00:34:08,065
<i>Coach Higgins decided to pack it in,
so we could all go home.</i>

435
00:34:08,143 --> 00:34:13,206
<i>It was a decision that would haunt
the poor man for the rest of his life.</i>

436
00:34:15,116 --> 00:34:17,175
Simon!

437
00:34:17,252 --> 00:34:19,482
You're up.

438
00:34:19,554 --> 00:34:21,488
Come on, Simon. Come on.

439
00:34:21,556 --> 00:34:25,458
Just make contact with the ball.

440
00:34:25,527 --> 00:34:28,860
Oh, no.

441
00:34:30,498 --> 00:34:33,695
Simon, swing away.

442
00:34:33,768 --> 00:34:39,070
- What?
- You heard me. Swing the bat.

443
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:43,668
- Yes, sir.
- All right, set 'em up
and knock 'em down.

444
00:34:43,745 --> 00:34:46,009
You got it, Simon.

445
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,173
Pitch this one home.

446
00:34:48,249 --> 00:34:50,683
Ball... one.

447
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,686
Simon.

448
00:34:52,754 --> 00:34:55,222
- Swing the bat.
- It was too high.

449
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:57,383
Come on, Simon.
You can do it.

450
00:34:57,459 --> 00:35:01,418
- Send it over the fence.
- Be sure to let go of the bat,
so you don't go with it.

451
00:35:01,496 --> 00:35:05,091
All right. Let's go.

452
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:08,499
- Ball... two.
- Simon.

453
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:12,165
Swing the bat. Swing.

454
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,540
- I'm picking my pitch.
- Ah, for Christ's sakes.

455
00:35:20,415 --> 00:35:22,349
Rebecca!

456
00:36:41,729 --> 00:36:43,663
Sh-She's dead.

457
00:37:13,194 --> 00:37:16,391
I'm sorry.

458
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,175
I'm sorry.

459
00:37:32,447 --> 00:37:35,905
Lord, grant that I may seek more...

460
00:37:35,984 --> 00:37:39,385
to comfort, than to be comforted,

461
00:37:39,454 --> 00:37:42,480
to love, than be loved.

462
00:37:42,557 --> 00:37:54,594
For it is by self-forgetting
that one finds...

463
00:37:54,669 --> 00:37:58,730
Hear our prayers on behalf
of Thy servant, Rebecca.

464
00:37:58,806 --> 00:38:04,176
And grant her entrance
into the land of light and joy,

465
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:09,775
in the fellowship
of Thy saints.

466
00:38:12,754 --> 00:38:15,780
In sure and certain hope
of the resurrection to eternal life...

467
00:38:15,857 --> 00:38:19,918
through our Lord, Jesus Christ,
we commend our sister, Rebecca.

468
00:38:22,597 --> 00:38:25,532
And we commit her body
to the ground.

469
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,468
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes.

470
00:38:29,537 --> 00:38:33,200
And dust to dust.

471
00:38:33,274 --> 00:38:36,471
The Lord bless her
and keep her.

472
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,314
Amen.

473
00:39:24,525 --> 00:39:26,755
Mind if I join ya?

474
00:39:40,842 --> 00:39:42,776
Whatcha got there?

475
00:39:42,844 --> 00:39:47,304
Simon's baseball cards.
He gave 'em to me.

476
00:39:47,381 --> 00:39:49,315
Hmm.

477
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:53,653
I don't get it.
Stupid baseball cards are...

478
00:39:53,721 --> 00:39:55,814
Simon's favorite thing
in the world.

479
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:58,415
Maybe that's why
he gave them to you.

480
00:39:58,493 --> 00:40:00,984
I don't want 'em.

481
00:40:01,062 --> 00:40:04,327
That's a good thing because
I bet you he wants 'em back.

482
00:40:08,836 --> 00:40:12,169
- I still don't get it.
- Maybe it's his way of saying, "Sorry."

483
00:40:13,441 --> 00:40:15,875
That he still loves you.

484
00:40:15,943 --> 00:40:19,811
I mean, he's trusting you
with them, right?

485
00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:25,979
- So what should I do?
- I don't know.

486
00:40:26,053 --> 00:40:28,920
Give him somethin'
in return?

487
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:31,652
Somethin' that he knows
you want back.

488
00:40:49,944 --> 00:40:51,878
What's this?

489
00:40:51,946 --> 00:40:56,883
It's for Simon.
Make sure he gets it.

490
00:41:39,193 --> 00:41:41,593
My mother found
the armadillo.

491
00:41:41,662 --> 00:41:44,426
- She fainted.
- For real?

492
00:41:44,498 --> 00:41:47,695
Just like in the movies.
Screamed and dropped.

493
00:41:47,768 --> 00:41:51,397
- Cool.
- It was pretty boss.

494
00:41:51,906 --> 00:41:53,840
Here.

495
00:42:02,383 --> 00:42:07,446
You know, when I first
saw the bag, I thought that
maybe the baseball was in it.

496
00:42:07,521 --> 00:42:10,752
- What? Why?
- I don't know.

497
00:42:10,824 --> 00:42:13,190
You did take it,
didn't you?

498
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:16,093
Why would I want to possess
that fated baseball?

499
00:42:16,163 --> 00:42:18,097
Well, somebody took
the ball.

500
00:42:18,899 --> 00:42:21,697
Who else would want it?

501
00:42:21,769 --> 00:42:25,205
- Maybe he was there that day.
- Who?

502
00:42:25,272 --> 00:42:27,832
Your father.
Maybe he took the ball.

503
00:42:33,514 --> 00:42:36,039
I'm sorry, Joe.

504
00:42:36,116 --> 00:42:39,051
- It was out of my hands.
- What do you mean?

505
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,317
I'm God's instrument.
I wish it was someone else.

506
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:46,723
- But he wanted it to be me.
- Simon, it was an accident.

507
00:42:46,794 --> 00:42:49,490
There are no accidents.
God has a plan for all of us.

508
00:42:49,563 --> 00:42:53,556
There's no plan, Simon.
Don't you understand that by now?

509
00:42:53,634 --> 00:42:56,125
- But God...
- There is no God.

510
00:42:56,203 --> 00:42:58,262
It's like believing
in Santa Claus or the Easter bunny.

511
00:42:58,339 --> 00:43:00,330
- It's all bullshit, Simon.
- Don't say that.

512
00:43:00,407 --> 00:43:02,375
My mom is dead because
she got hit by a baseball,

513
00:43:02,443 --> 00:43:05,139
and you're small because
you were born a sick baby.

514
00:43:05,212 --> 00:43:08,579
That's it. Just stop trying
to make sense of it all. You can't.

515
00:43:10,551 --> 00:43:12,849
Joe.

516
00:43:36,677 --> 00:43:38,611
Simon.

517
00:43:52,326 --> 00:43:55,955
Into paradise...

518
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:59,022
may the angels...

519
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:01,624
lead you.

520
00:44:06,473 --> 00:44:09,135
Simon. Simon.

521
00:44:11,545 --> 00:44:13,706
I hear you.
What do you want?

522
00:44:13,781 --> 00:44:15,715
What do you want from me?

523
00:44:15,783 --> 00:44:18,946
Simon, it's me.

524
00:44:22,523 --> 00:44:24,457
Oh.

525
00:44:24,525 --> 00:44:27,050
I thought you were...

526
00:44:28,829 --> 00:44:30,763
someone else.

527
00:44:40,207 --> 00:44:43,074
I'm sorry.

528
00:44:45,612 --> 00:44:47,637
I know.

529
00:44:53,187 --> 00:44:55,747
Come on. Let's go home.

530
00:45:11,105 --> 00:45:13,539
Timber-r-r!

531
00:45:15,609 --> 00:45:17,543
One year good luck.

532
00:45:17,611 --> 00:45:19,545
One year good luck.

533
00:45:29,022 --> 00:45:31,320
Oh! Oh, man, that's cold!

534
00:45:31,392 --> 00:45:34,020
- It's freezing!
- My balls just turned into prunes.

535
00:45:34,094 --> 00:45:37,257
My balls just turned
into raisins.

536
00:45:38,465 --> 00:45:40,956
Look!

537
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:52,176
Come on.
I'll race you to the dock.

538
00:45:52,246 --> 00:45:55,215
Nah, I don't think...
Ready, set, go.

539
00:45:55,282 --> 00:45:57,750
Hey, cheater!

540
00:45:59,753 --> 00:46:02,244
<i>When someone you love dies,</i>

541
00:46:02,322 --> 00:46:04,916
<i>you don't lose them
all at once.</i>

542
00:46:04,992 --> 00:46:07,426
<i>You lose them in pieces,
over time.</i>

543
00:46:07,494 --> 00:46:11,089
<i>Like how the mail
stops coming.</i>

544
00:46:11,165 --> 00:46:14,726
<i>What I remember most to this day
was my mother's scent.</i>

545
00:46:14,802 --> 00:46:18,329
<i>And how I hated it
when it began to disappear.</i>

546
00:46:18,405 --> 00:46:21,932
<i>First from her closets
and drawers,</i>

547
00:46:22,009 --> 00:46:25,843
<i>then from her dresses
she had sewed herself,</i>

548
00:46:25,913 --> 00:46:28,473
<i>and finally, from her bed sheets
and pillowcases.</i>

549
00:46:31,552 --> 00:46:35,511
<i>Simon and I never talked much
about that day on the baseball field.</i>

550
00:46:35,589 --> 00:46:39,525
<i>It was too painful
for both of us.</i>

551
00:46:39,593 --> 00:46:41,857
<i>For as much as I loved
my mother,</i>

552
00:46:41,929 --> 00:46:44,420
<i>I knew that Simon loved her
just as much.</i>

553
00:46:47,768 --> 00:46:50,430
<i>She was the only real mother
he ever had.</i>

554
00:47:14,861 --> 00:47:17,557
Hi, Grandmother.

555
00:47:19,899 --> 00:47:21,833
Grandmother?

556
00:47:23,503 --> 00:47:25,664
Joe.

557
00:47:28,041 --> 00:47:30,874
Come here.

558
00:47:33,513 --> 00:47:36,744
Sit down.

559
00:47:40,353 --> 00:47:44,255
Your mother was very proud of you.

560
00:47:44,324 --> 00:47:46,258
Do you know that?

561
00:47:48,895 --> 00:47:52,422
She didn't want
any other children.

562
00:47:52,498 --> 00:47:54,432
Just you.

563
00:48:04,377 --> 00:48:06,777
I'm old, Joe.
I won't be around forever.

564
00:48:06,846 --> 00:48:09,314
- Grandmother, don't say that.
- Shh.

565
00:48:09,382 --> 00:48:13,148
And when I die,

566
00:48:13,219 --> 00:48:16,655
there will be no one left
to look after you.

567
00:48:18,124 --> 00:48:22,220
So, we have to decide
what's to become of you.

568
00:48:24,764 --> 00:48:27,130
What about my father?

569
00:48:30,303 --> 00:48:34,501
Only your mother knew
who that was.

570
00:48:35,441 --> 00:48:37,500
She never even told me.

571
00:48:37,577 --> 00:48:39,772
Well, what if
I could find him?

572
00:48:39,846 --> 00:48:42,872
I mean, if he could just meet me.
If he knew what I was like.

573
00:48:42,949 --> 00:48:44,974
You can't think that way.

574
00:48:54,427 --> 00:48:57,794
You have only yourself
to depend on now.

575
00:49:01,301 --> 00:49:03,235
Understand?

576
00:49:19,419 --> 00:49:22,388
You go wash up.

577
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,794
<i>I knew then
that playing the guessing game...</i>

578
00:49:36,869 --> 00:49:39,667
<i>with Simon wasn't going
to be enough anymore.</i>

579
00:49:39,739 --> 00:49:43,004
<i>I no longer just wanted to know
just who my father was,</i>

580
00:49:43,076 --> 00:49:46,637
<i>I had to know,
and I was running out of time.</i>

581
00:50:02,195 --> 00:50:04,129
Suspect at 2:00.

582
00:50:04,197 --> 00:50:07,462
- Mr. Van Gundy?
- He taught your mother piano, right?

583
00:50:07,533 --> 00:50:10,400
That was five years ago, Simon.
I'm 12, remember?

584
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:14,167
Oh, yeah. You're kind of small
for your age, aren't you?

585
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,970
Suspect sweeping.

586
00:50:17,043 --> 00:50:20,979
- Mr. Prescott?
- He always saved the best cuts
of meat for my mom.

587
00:50:21,047 --> 00:50:26,075
I don't see how pork chops
could lead to intercourse,
no matter how good they are.

588
00:50:29,522 --> 00:50:34,255
- Hi, Ben.
- Hey.

589
00:50:34,327 --> 00:50:37,922
- What are you guys doing?
- We were just...
- It's personal.

590
00:50:37,997 --> 00:50:40,329
Oh.

591
00:50:42,668 --> 00:50:44,863
- Hey, Ben.
- Hey, Bob. How are you?

592
00:50:44,937 --> 00:50:47,030
Hi, Mr. Baker.

593
00:50:48,274 --> 00:50:52,608
Hey, guys. Hi, Joe.

594
00:50:52,678 --> 00:50:56,307
You know, I didn't get a chance
to talk to you after the funeral.

595
00:50:56,382 --> 00:50:58,509
There were a lot of people.

596
00:50:58,584 --> 00:51:02,680
That's because your mother
was a very special person.

597
00:51:04,881 --> 00:51:06,282
You need anything,

598
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:08,623
just call, okay?

599
00:51:08,694 --> 00:51:12,095
- Okay.
- Okay.

600
00:51:12,165 --> 00:51:15,828
Well, good luck
on your first day of school, guys.

601
00:51:15,902 --> 00:51:18,336
Just give me a holler
if you need anything, Ben.

602
00:51:18,404 --> 00:51:20,736
The office isn't usually
much help.

603
00:51:20,807 --> 00:51:23,901
Okay, thanks.

604
00:51:23,976 --> 00:51:27,207
I might try out for the swim team
this year, Mr. Baker.

605
00:51:28,815 --> 00:51:31,841
That's great, Joe.

606
00:51:31,918 --> 00:51:36,014
I'm a swimmer just like you.
I'm just like you.

607
00:51:40,126 --> 00:51:44,324
Hey, either you guys
taking any drama courses this fall?

608
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:50,625
So, you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna finish off my errands,

609
00:51:50,703 --> 00:51:54,696
and, uh, if you guys feel like it,
uh, come say "hi" tomorrow.

610
00:51:54,774 --> 00:51:56,765
Okay? All right.

611
00:51:56,843 --> 00:52:00,779
Bye, Ben.

612
00:52:00,847 --> 00:52:04,442
- He called my mom a special person.
- A "very" special person.

613
00:52:04,517 --> 00:52:07,543
They did spend the night talking
at the parent-teacher conference.

614
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:09,918
Why didn't
you mention this before?

615
00:52:09,989 --> 00:52:12,116
It's a parent-teacher conference,
they're supposed to talk.

616
00:52:12,191 --> 00:52:15,024
Not all night.
Especially with a gym teacher.

617
00:52:15,094 --> 00:52:17,892
What did you think
they were doing?

618
00:52:17,964 --> 00:52:20,956
Discussing your future
in dodgeball?

619
00:52:22,335 --> 00:52:25,862
Mr. Baker.

620
00:52:25,938 --> 00:52:27,872
Yeah.

621
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:30,067
Let's go! Let's go!
Keep your legs kicking!

622
00:52:30,142 --> 00:52:32,076
Keep your legs kicking
right to the end!

623
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,739
- Hey, that's great.
That's great. Good work.

624
00:52:35,815 --> 00:52:39,342
Good work, you guys. That's pretty good
for a first day of practice.

625
00:52:39,418 --> 00:52:42,012
Sean, good work.
Grab a towel.

626
00:52:42,088 --> 00:52:44,022
Terrific!

627
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:46,923
We'll see you guys tomorrow.

628
00:52:56,614 --> 00:52:59,528
- Fifty-four Mississippi.
- Shh. God, Simon.

629
00:52:59,605 --> 00:53:02,631
- It's a new record.
- News flash. Nobody cares.

630
00:53:02,708 --> 00:53:04,972
I care.

631
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,759
Did you hear that?

632
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:30,165
Shh.

633
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:36,970
- What is it?
- Aah! It's a horse.

634
00:53:54,193 --> 00:53:57,219
Nice dog.

635
00:54:03,903 --> 00:54:08,033
Brutus! Brutus, where are you?

636
00:54:21,354 --> 00:54:23,379
Come on.

637
00:54:28,027 --> 00:54:29,824
It's locked.

638
00:54:29,895 --> 00:54:31,954
- Well, I guess that's that.
Come on. Let's go.
- Wait!

639
00:54:32,031 --> 00:54:34,795
Do you think if I gave you
a boost, you might be able...

640
00:54:34,867 --> 00:54:36,858
to reach the mail slot
and unlock the door?

641
00:54:36,936 --> 00:54:38,460
- No.
- Oh, come on!

642
00:54:38,537 --> 00:54:40,505
You're always saying that God
has a special plan for you, right?

643
00:54:40,573 --> 00:54:43,371
- That he made you
this size for a reason.
- I don't think God's plan...

644
00:54:43,442 --> 00:54:45,307
includes breaking and entering.

645
00:54:45,378 --> 00:54:48,973
We're not breaking anything!
Come on, please?

646
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:59,053
- Ow, ow, ow.
- Did you get it?

647
00:55:00,126 --> 00:55:02,828
Ow! Got it! Oh!

648
00:55:07,999 --> 00:55:09,933
It's locked!
Now, let's go!

649
00:55:17,475 --> 00:55:20,842
- Are you crazy?
- I've got to know.

650
00:55:45,337 --> 00:55:48,704
Well, go on.

651
00:56:03,188 --> 00:56:07,284
Well, is it our ball?
Does it say "Tigers"?

652
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:09,554
Come on, Joe.
What's it say?

653
00:56:16,735 --> 00:56:20,034
- It's-lt's not fair.
- Joe?

654
00:56:21,573 --> 00:56:23,336
- Joe!
- It's not fair!

655
00:56:34,252 --> 00:56:36,220
It's not fair.

656
00:57:13,224 --> 00:57:15,556
What the hell's
the matter with you boys?

657
00:57:15,627 --> 00:57:17,720
Baker fail you
in phys ed or something?

658
00:57:17,796 --> 00:57:20,731
- Simon didn't do anything.
This is all my fault.
- I helped you break in.

659
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:22,926
- No, he didn't.
- You couldn't have done it without me.

660
00:57:23,001 --> 00:57:25,492
- Shut up, will ya?
- Nice try, Joe.

661
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:30,064
Now, the way that
I figure this,

662
00:57:30,141 --> 00:57:32,939
you can either do hard time
right here in prison,

663
00:57:34,479 --> 00:57:37,175
or you can do
community service.

664
00:57:37,248 --> 00:57:39,182
Community service.

665
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:41,184
That's what I thought.

666
00:57:41,252 --> 00:57:45,052
And I've already
called the reverend,
and he'd be just delighted...

667
00:57:45,123 --> 00:57:49,082
to have the two of you help him
with his Junior Lamb's Winter Retreat.

668
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:52,755
But that's over
Christmas break.

669
00:57:52,831 --> 00:57:55,857
Yeah, we don't want to babysit the
stupid third graders at some dumb camp.

670
00:57:55,934 --> 00:58:01,031
Fine! I'll just go out there in the
back room and get your prison uniforms.

671
00:58:01,106 --> 00:58:05,907
- Okay, okay! We'll do it.
- Good.

672
00:58:05,977 --> 00:58:08,537
Now, Joe. I'm gonna call your
grandmother to come and pick you up.

673
00:58:08,613 --> 00:58:12,845
- Oh, she doesn't drive.
- Well, I've got to have
somebody pick you two up.

674
00:58:12,917 --> 00:58:15,943
I've only got two men on tonight
and they're both out in the field.

675
00:58:16,021 --> 00:58:21,425
- What about my parents?
- Joe, do you have any other relatives?

676
00:58:21,493 --> 00:58:24,758
- No, sir.
- Did you call my parents?

677
00:58:24,829 --> 00:58:27,730
Yes, I did.

678
00:58:27,799 --> 00:58:30,529
What did they say?

679
00:58:30,602 --> 00:58:35,733
They said that...

680
00:58:35,807 --> 00:58:38,605
maybe that we should leave you
here for the night.

681
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:44,374
I guess they thought
it might teach you a lesson.

682
00:58:46,785 --> 00:58:51,154
Anyhow, I gotta get
you guys outta here.

683
00:58:51,222 --> 00:58:53,952
Do you know anybody that might come
down here at this hour of the night?

684
00:58:54,025 --> 00:58:57,290
- Yeah.
- Who?

685
00:58:57,362 --> 00:59:01,264
Yeah, who?

686
00:59:01,466 --> 00:59:06,096
Just about
to land in WGV. Let's click on
the turnstiles on our wax files.

687
00:59:06,171 --> 00:59:08,435
- Ben?
- Yeah?

688
00:59:08,506 --> 00:59:11,805
- Are you mad?
- No.

689
00:59:11,876 --> 00:59:13,810
Well, baffled,
but not mad.

690
00:59:13,878 --> 00:59:16,676
I assume you had a good reason
for doing what you did.

691
00:59:16,748 --> 00:59:19,444
- The reason is that Joe went psycho.
- Shut up, Simon.

692
00:59:19,517 --> 00:59:21,451
That's a good reason as any.

693
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:23,453
- It is?
- Sure.

694
00:59:23,521 --> 00:59:26,581
Everyone's got to reserve
the right to go a little nuts
every now and then.

695
00:59:26,658 --> 00:59:29,684
- Life isn't always so easy.
- Or fair.

696
00:59:29,761 --> 00:59:32,127
Oh, it's certainly not fair.

697
00:59:32,197 --> 00:59:34,131
Hey, you guys want to go get,

698
00:59:34,199 --> 00:59:36,724
uh, some pizza
or a hot dog or somethin'?

699
00:59:36,801 --> 00:59:40,168
- You want to take us for pizza?
- Yeah, it's 9:00. Aren't you hungry?

700
00:59:40,238 --> 00:59:43,002
It's not that.
It would be like...

701
00:59:43,074 --> 00:59:46,202
rewarding us
for bad behavior.

702
00:59:46,277 --> 00:59:48,837
- But if you really want to.
- No, Joe.

703
00:59:48,913 --> 00:59:51,643
It wouldn't be right
to take advantage of Ben like that.

704
00:59:51,716 --> 00:59:53,650
No pizza for us.

705
00:59:53,718 --> 00:59:56,186
Okay.

706
01:00:05,497 --> 01:00:07,431
Ice cream?

707
01:00:09,467 --> 01:00:12,197
So, now I don't know
if I'll ever find out who my father is.

708
01:00:14,772 --> 01:00:20,074
Maybe she figured
you weren't ready for the truth.

709
01:00:20,145 --> 01:00:22,010
Ben?

710
01:00:23,581 --> 01:00:25,708
Do you know the truth?

711
01:00:25,783 --> 01:00:30,447
No. I guess your mom was just
gonna tell me when she was ready.

712
01:00:33,958 --> 01:00:37,894
But if you did know,
would you tell me?

713
01:00:40,398 --> 01:00:42,628
Yeah.

714
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:45,134
Yes, I would.

715
01:00:45,203 --> 01:00:48,036
Ben?

716
01:00:48,106 --> 01:00:51,473
Did Miss Wenteworth
ever talk about me?

717
01:00:51,543 --> 01:00:53,477
All the time, Simon.

718
01:00:53,545 --> 01:00:55,604
Everybody talks about you.

719
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:57,705
That's how we keep
from gettin' bored.

720
01:00:57,782 --> 01:01:00,273
- Did she tell you about my destiny?
- Simon!

721
01:01:00,351 --> 01:01:02,376
What do you mean?

722
01:01:02,453 --> 01:01:04,546
- I'm going to be a hero.
- You are?

723
01:01:04,622 --> 01:01:07,750
Pretty vague job description,
isn't it?

724
01:01:07,825 --> 01:01:11,955
- How you gonna do that?
- I don't know.

725
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:13,964
I keep waiting for God
to show me a sign.

726
01:01:14,032 --> 01:01:16,933
Like the burning bush
in the Ten Commandments.

727
01:01:19,003 --> 01:01:22,404
But I guess he doesn't go in
for that kind of thing anymore.

728
01:01:22,473 --> 01:01:25,772
Well, uh, you know,
you got to be a little patient.

729
01:01:25,843 --> 01:01:30,007
I have been patient,
but I'm running out of time.

730
01:01:30,081 --> 01:01:34,575
Simon, you're
12 years old!

731
01:01:34,652 --> 01:01:36,586
You've got all the time
in the world!

732
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:41,850
I don't think so, Ben.

733
01:01:51,402 --> 01:01:56,339
<i>Time is a monster
that cannot be reasoned with.</i>

734
01:01:56,407 --> 01:02:00,241
<i>It responds like
a snail to our impatience.</i>

735
01:02:00,311 --> 01:02:04,748
<i>Then it races like a gazelle
when you can't catch your breath.</i>

736
01:02:04,816 --> 01:02:08,013
<i>Simon and I were in such a hurry
to get to the answers at the end...</i>

737
01:02:08,086 --> 01:02:11,317
<i>of the road that we never took time
to read the signs along the way.</i>

738
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:16,226
<i>How could we have known that everything
was working together for a reason?</i>

739
01:02:16,294 --> 01:02:18,694
And so I expect
each and every one of you...

740
01:02:18,763 --> 01:02:20,958
will lend a hand
in making this...

741
01:02:21,032 --> 01:02:23,796
the best Christmas
pageant ever.

742
01:02:26,871 --> 01:02:29,533
So, now, are there
any volunteers for roles,

743
01:02:29,607 --> 01:02:33,134
- or shall I just choose?
- Well, I'll play Joseph!

744
01:02:33,211 --> 01:02:35,179
Good for you, Eddie.

745
01:02:35,246 --> 01:02:38,044
- Looks like I got the lead.
- What lead?

746
01:02:38,116 --> 01:02:40,050
It's the Virgin Mary, Eddie.

747
01:02:40,118 --> 01:02:42,518
What does Joseph
have to do with anything?

748
01:02:42,587 --> 01:02:45,181
All right, now.
Any volunteers for Mary?

749
01:02:45,256 --> 01:02:48,020
Beautiful, beautiful
Mother Mary.

750
01:02:50,895 --> 01:02:53,455
Mary, Mary, Mary.

751
01:02:53,531 --> 01:02:55,465
Who will it be?

752
01:03:02,273 --> 01:03:04,207
Marjorie?

753
01:03:04,275 --> 01:03:06,766
Would you like to be
our Mary this year?

754
01:03:06,844 --> 01:03:10,245
- Yes, ma'am.
- Good girl!

755
01:03:12,317 --> 01:03:14,683
All right, now.
Which one of our...

756
01:03:14,752 --> 01:03:18,990
future stars
would like to be the Three Wise Men?

757
01:03:19,123 --> 01:03:21,091
Hm?

758
01:03:21,158 --> 01:03:23,524
Three Wise Men.
Who's it gonna be?

759
01:03:23,594 --> 01:03:25,528
All right.

760
01:03:25,596 --> 01:03:30,932
Gary, Allen, Matthew,
you will be the Wise Men.

761
01:03:31,002 --> 01:03:33,163
Now let's see what we've got.

762
01:03:33,237 --> 01:03:35,432
Ah, well, we've got
the shepherds,

763
01:03:35,506 --> 01:03:37,633
but they don't have
a lot to do.

764
01:03:37,708 --> 01:03:40,108
<i>Miss Leavey
always tried to downplay...</i>

765
01:03:40,177 --> 01:03:42,611
<i>the role of the shepherds,
but we weren't fooled.</i>

766
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:46,241
<i>We knew they were the plum roles
because all you had to do...</i>

767
01:03:46,317 --> 01:03:48,547
<i>was stand around with a staff
and try not to laugh...</i>

768
01:03:48,619 --> 01:03:51,144
<i>at the poor saps that got stuck
with the speaking parts.</i>

769
01:03:51,222 --> 01:03:53,486
All right.
Hands-Hands down. Hands down.

770
01:03:53,557 --> 01:03:57,618
Uh, Joe, Melanie,
Ming, Tommy.

771
01:03:57,695 --> 01:04:02,394
You will be
our shepherds.

772
01:04:02,466 --> 01:04:04,400
All right.
Now, let's see what's next.

773
01:04:04,468 --> 01:04:06,766
We've got...
Oh, the angel.

774
01:04:06,837 --> 01:04:08,771
Yes, the angel.

775
01:04:08,839 --> 01:04:12,900
The wonderful angel
of the Lord...

776
01:04:12,977 --> 01:04:17,607
suspended high, high above
everyone else...

777
01:04:17,681 --> 01:04:22,948
the wonderful, magnificent angel
of the Lord.

778
01:04:24,021 --> 01:04:25,955
Aww!

779
01:04:26,023 --> 01:04:28,457
- I can't! I'm afraid of heights!
- Well, then, this will be...

780
01:04:28,526 --> 01:04:30,460
the perfect chance
to face your fears.

781
01:04:30,528 --> 01:04:32,758
- Can't I be a donkey or somethin'?
- You're an angel.

782
01:04:32,830 --> 01:04:35,924
You have your own special pillar
of light for all the world to see.

783
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,935
- Well, I'll switch with Howard.
- No!
- Yeah!

784
01:04:39,003 --> 01:04:40,800
- I could be Joseph. Joseph does nothing.
- Told ya.

785
01:04:40,871 --> 01:04:43,965
You are going to make
a wonderful angel, Howard.

786
01:04:44,041 --> 01:04:47,977
- But...
- Thank you.

787
01:04:48,045 --> 01:04:52,106
- Psycho.
- What about me?

788
01:04:52,183 --> 01:04:55,311
Well, Simon, you know what?

789
01:04:55,386 --> 01:04:58,446
- You have the most important
role of all.
- No.

790
01:04:58,522 --> 01:05:01,082
Without you,
there would be no play.

791
01:05:01,158 --> 01:05:03,718
I'm not playing the baby Jesus,
so just forget it!

792
01:05:03,794 --> 01:05:06,524
- You're the only one
who fits into the manger.
- I won't do it!

793
01:05:06,597 --> 01:05:09,395
Come on, Simon.
It'll be fun.

794
01:05:20,044 --> 01:05:24,879
Easy! It says swaddling clothes.
Swaddle it!

795
01:05:24,949 --> 01:05:27,850
Simon, that is so cute!

796
01:05:27,918 --> 01:05:31,081
I look like a burn victim.

797
01:05:32,723 --> 01:05:35,590
- You made her laugh.
- She's laughing at me.

798
01:05:35,659 --> 01:05:37,889
What's the difference?
She likes you.

799
01:05:37,962 --> 01:05:40,726
Everyone likes
the swaddling baby Jesus.

800
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:42,823
- It's great!
- You really like it? Well, thank you.

801
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:45,425
Why does Ming get
all the girls?

802
01:05:46,637 --> 01:05:48,571
But, uh, things
will be different...

803
01:05:48,639 --> 01:05:50,573
once God makes you
a hero, right, Simon?

804
01:05:57,581 --> 01:06:00,209
- Right?
- Huh?

805
01:06:00,284 --> 01:06:03,720
Oh, yeah.
I guess.

806
01:06:03,787 --> 01:06:07,518
You! You, you, you,
you, you, you! Okay, okay. Come on.

807
01:06:07,591 --> 01:06:10,219
So, is everybody ready
for dress rehearsal?

808
01:06:10,294 --> 01:06:12,455
- No.
- What now, Simon?

809
01:06:12,530 --> 01:06:14,555
What are those?

810
01:06:14,632 --> 01:06:17,430
- They're turtledoves.
- They look like
they're from outer space.

811
01:06:17,501 --> 01:06:19,435
The audience won't know
what they are.

812
01:06:19,503 --> 01:06:22,961
They're doves, Simon!
The audience knows what a dove is!

813
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:26,407
They're giant doves!
They're as big as half a donkey!

814
01:06:26,477 --> 01:06:28,411
They're actually
kind of frightening!

815
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:33,178
Oh, look what I found
wandering off. A turtle.

816
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:35,684
Oh! A little turtledove! Look at that.

817
01:06:35,753 --> 01:06:39,018
Oh, so how's
the rehearsal going?

818
01:06:39,089 --> 01:06:44,152
Help. Please! I'm gonna strangle him.

819
01:06:44,228 --> 01:06:46,594
I swear to God! I'm gonna strangle
that little granite mouse...

820
01:06:46,664 --> 01:06:48,598
if it's the last thing I do,
with my bare hands!

821
01:06:48,666 --> 01:06:51,226
- I'm gonna strangle him!
I'm a little fragile right now.
- Simon.

822
01:07:11,155 --> 01:07:14,090
- Hey!
- You'll get these back
after the pageant.

823
01:07:14,158 --> 01:07:16,649
If you can stop yourself
from ruining our play.

824
01:07:16,727 --> 01:07:18,661
Understand?

825
01:07:23,067 --> 01:07:25,001
Any questions?

826
01:07:27,571 --> 01:07:30,039
Does God have
a plan for us?

827
01:07:35,379 --> 01:07:37,313
I like to think he does.

828
01:07:37,381 --> 01:07:41,215
Me too! I think God made me
the way I am for a reason.

829
01:07:41,285 --> 01:07:46,348
Well, I'm glad that, um,
that your faith, uh...

830
01:07:46,423 --> 01:07:49,551
helps you deal
with your, um,

831
01:07:49,627 --> 01:07:52,061
you know,
your-your condition.

832
01:07:52,129 --> 01:07:54,461
That's not what I mean.

833
01:07:54,531 --> 01:07:57,329
I think I'm
God's instrument.

834
01:07:57,401 --> 01:08:00,199
That He's gonna use me
to carry out His plan.

835
01:08:00,271 --> 01:08:02,296
It's wonderful
to have faith, Simon,

836
01:08:02,373 --> 01:08:06,241
but, uh,
let's not overdo it.

837
01:08:21,625 --> 01:08:24,150
God's instrument.

838
01:08:30,530 --> 01:08:33,894
Hey, kid. You okay?

839
01:08:33,971 --> 01:08:37,998
- Hey, kid.
- Hi. What's wrong?

840
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:42,707
My dad's makin' me go
on a retreat tomorrow.

841
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:46,580
- Why are you crying?
- I'm scared of all the other kids.

842
01:08:46,650 --> 01:08:48,584
They're a lot
bigger than me.

843
01:08:48,652 --> 01:08:52,679
- Not all of them.
- Are you going too?

844
01:08:52,756 --> 01:08:55,657
And I'll make sure
nothing happens to you. I promise.

845
01:08:55,726 --> 01:08:59,059
Now get over there with those other
flying monkeys where you belong.

846
01:08:59,129 --> 01:09:02,895
We're turtledoves.

847
01:09:02,966 --> 01:09:06,026
Quack. Quack.

848
01:09:06,103 --> 01:09:09,664
- You're good with him.
- Little kids always listen to me...

849
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:12,641
because of the way I look.

850
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:16,237
- Too bad Marjorie isn't six years old.
- Not funny!

851
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:19,506
The star of Bethlehem
is not a pinata.

852
01:09:19,583 --> 01:09:22,211
Marjorie! Marjorie!
You spit that gum out right now!

853
01:09:22,286 --> 01:09:24,220
The Virgin Mary
does not chew gum.

854
01:09:24,288 --> 01:09:26,984
Where are we going?
You get down from there!

855
01:09:27,057 --> 01:09:28,991
Get down from there now!
It's not safe!

856
01:09:29,059 --> 01:09:31,823
I've got half a donkey here.
What good is that gonna do me?

857
01:09:33,630 --> 01:09:36,155
I need a cigarette.

858
01:09:37,234 --> 01:09:40,397
Monsters.

859
01:09:55,085 --> 01:09:57,019
Oh! Oh, hello, Agnes.

860
01:09:57,087 --> 01:10:00,614
Hello, Reverend. Hi.

861
01:10:00,691 --> 01:10:02,625
Ah, ready for tonight?

862
01:10:02,693 --> 01:10:04,627
Absolutely.

863
01:10:04,695 --> 01:10:07,255
# Joy to the world #

864
01:10:07,331 --> 01:10:10,698
# Miss Leavey's dead #

865
01:10:10,768 --> 01:10:13,464
# They guillotined her head #

866
01:10:13,537 --> 01:10:17,974
# We took it from her body #

867
01:10:18,041 --> 01:10:20,839
# And flushed it
down the potty #

868
01:10:20,911 --> 01:10:23,277
# And watched it go round and round #

869
01:10:23,347 --> 01:10:26,214
# And watched it go round and round #

870
01:10:26,283 --> 01:10:31,414
# And watched it go round and round
and never saw it go down #

871
01:10:31,488 --> 01:10:36,050
# Joy to the world
Miss Leavey's gone #

872
01:10:36,126 --> 01:10:39,960
- Oh, Agnes.
- Oh! Oh!

873
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:42,692
# She's buried
in the lawn #

874
01:11:04,956 --> 01:11:07,186
Psst! Psst!

875
01:11:08,584 --> 01:11:10,819
Thank you.

876
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:15,229
Merry Christmas.

877
01:11:15,299 --> 01:11:17,613
Merry Christmas to you too.

878
01:11:18,202 --> 01:11:20,602
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

879
01:12:08,332 --> 01:12:09,281
Go, go.

880
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:12,345
Be not afraid.

881
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:19,178
For I bring you great joy.

882
01:13:19,257 --> 01:13:22,988
Be not afraid!

883
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:24,994
For... F...

884
01:13:25,062 --> 01:13:27,030
- For...
- Simon.

885
01:13:27,098 --> 01:13:29,225
Are you okay?

886
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:34,627
For I bring you great...

887
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:38,306
joy!

888
01:13:38,376 --> 01:13:41,072
Oh, man! Oh, man!

889
01:13:42,831 --> 01:13:44,808
Oh, oh, man!

890
01:13:46,417 --> 01:13:49,648
Simon, what is it?

891
01:13:51,452 --> 01:13:52,848
Boobs!

892
01:13:55,726 --> 01:13:58,354
- Get her, Simon!
- Holy shit!

893
01:14:04,068 --> 01:14:07,003
Oh, shit!

894
01:14:08,172 --> 01:14:10,697
- Let go of me!
- I'm trying to help!

895
01:14:10,775 --> 01:14:13,539
Uuh!

896
01:14:13,611 --> 01:14:16,341
Ohh!

897
01:14:16,414 --> 01:14:19,076
- I don't feel so good.
- If you vomit on this stage,

898
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:21,243
I swear I will leave you
up there...

899
01:14:21,319 --> 01:14:23,844
- till next Christmas!
- Hold on!

900
01:14:23,921 --> 01:14:26,048
Uh-oh.

901
01:14:28,195 --> 01:14:29,559
Yeah, yeah! Get it!

902
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:34,923
I'm gonna kick your ass,
you little perv.

903
01:14:34,999 --> 01:14:36,990
Hey, leave him alone.
Pick on someone your own size.

904
01:14:37,068 --> 01:14:38,865
- Okay.
- Oh!

905
01:14:38,936 --> 01:14:41,461
- I told you this was a bad idea.
- Fight! Fight!

906
01:14:41,539 --> 01:14:44,269
Oh, shit!

907
01:14:44,342 --> 01:14:46,810
I'm gonna honk!

908
01:14:48,312 --> 01:14:51,975
- Oh, no.
- Simon!

909
01:14:58,155 --> 01:15:00,646
Oh, no!

910
01:15:20,878 --> 01:15:23,108
Can I get down now?

911
01:15:28,552 --> 01:15:30,577
Congratulations, Simon.

912
01:15:30,654 --> 01:15:34,556
You've just given us our first
full-contact Christmas pageant.

913
01:15:37,928 --> 01:15:39,862
Well, do you have
anything to say?

914
01:15:41,565 --> 01:15:44,329
- Can I have my baseball cards back?
- No you may not!

915
01:15:48,105 --> 01:15:50,801
Oh, Simon.

916
01:15:50,875 --> 01:15:53,105
- What happened tonight?
- I don't know.

917
01:15:55,546 --> 01:15:57,776
Sex makes people crazy.

918
01:15:57,848 --> 01:16:02,717
That may be, uh... That may be true.

919
01:16:02,787 --> 01:16:05,915
But, uh, that is
no kind of answer.

920
01:16:07,191 --> 01:16:09,284
Simon,

921
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:12,352
you spend more time sitting
alone in a corner downstairs...

922
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:14,364
than you do
with the other children.

923
01:16:14,432 --> 01:16:18,528
You, uh, frighten them
with your stories...

924
01:16:18,602 --> 01:16:23,005
- about being an-an instrument of God.
- They're not stories.

925
01:16:23,073 --> 01:16:26,565
And you interrupt my sermons
and you refuse to apologize.

926
01:16:27,812 --> 01:16:29,803
I'm out of ideas, Simon.

927
01:16:31,215 --> 01:16:34,275
I can't speak
to your parents because,

928
01:16:34,351 --> 01:16:36,285
well, they don't
attend church.

929
01:16:36,353 --> 01:16:39,447
And I-I can't speak
to Rebecca because...

930
01:16:41,225 --> 01:16:43,159
because, uh...

931
01:16:44,428 --> 01:16:46,794
um...

932
01:16:46,864 --> 01:16:49,458
Simon, what I'm trying
to say is that...

933
01:16:49,533 --> 01:16:52,593
all of us around here...

934
01:16:52,670 --> 01:16:55,639
Well, we need a break from you.

935
01:16:55,706 --> 01:16:59,142
So, once this all simmers down,

936
01:16:59,210 --> 01:17:03,169
and Marjorie Albright's father
accepts your apology,

937
01:17:03,247 --> 01:17:05,181
we'll talk about
you coming back.

938
01:17:05,249 --> 01:17:08,184
- What about the retreat?
- Joe will go alone.

939
01:17:08,252 --> 01:17:11,710
And it's about time
I had a talk with him too.

940
01:17:11,789 --> 01:17:14,553
Simon, I'm sorry.

941
01:17:14,625 --> 01:17:17,389
but, as the Bible says,
"There is severe discipline...

942
01:17:17,461 --> 01:17:19,929
for him who forsakes the Way."

943
01:17:26,971 --> 01:17:29,997
"To impose a fine
on a righteous man is not good.

944
01:17:30,074 --> 01:17:32,599
To flog a noble man
is wrong."

945
01:17:32,676 --> 01:17:37,010
Proverb 17, Verse 26. That's, uh,
very good, Simon.

946
01:17:37,081 --> 01:17:41,313
But perhaps you know this one
as well: "Folly is bound up
in the heart of a child,

947
01:17:41,385 --> 01:17:44,252
but the rod of discipline
drives it far from him."

948
01:17:44,321 --> 01:17:48,052
- "Good sense makes a man slow to anger,
- Simon.

949
01:17:48,125 --> 01:17:52,118
- and it is glory
to overlook the offense."

950
01:17:53,797 --> 01:17:57,961
Simon... what do you
want me to do? Hmm?

951
01:17:58,035 --> 01:18:00,799
What do you want me to say?

952
01:18:00,871 --> 01:18:04,034
I want to know that
there's a reason for things.

953
01:18:04,108 --> 01:18:07,669
I used to be certain,
but now I'm not so sure.

954
01:18:07,745 --> 01:18:11,203
I want you to tell me
that God has a plan for me.

955
01:18:11,282 --> 01:18:13,477
A plan for all of us.

956
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:18,645
Please.

957
01:18:21,525 --> 01:18:23,550
Simon...

958
01:18:29,333 --> 01:18:31,267
I can't.

959
01:18:50,654 --> 01:18:53,623
Okay, you grabbed her boobs
and ya pulled her into the manger.

960
01:18:53,691 --> 01:18:55,818
Big deal. It could have
happened to anybody.

961
01:18:56,660 --> 01:18:59,128
Well, maybe not anybody.

962
01:19:00,497 --> 01:19:02,692
Who cares what
Reverend Russell says, huh?

963
01:19:02,766 --> 01:19:04,768
Him and his wife, they're the two
most miserable people we know.

964
01:19:04,768 --> 01:19:05,700
Him and his wife, they're the two
most miserable people we know.

965
01:19:38,902 --> 01:19:41,962
- You okay?
- Yeah.

966
01:19:48,978 --> 01:19:50,912
Where are ya goin'?

967
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:53,505
- Home.
- Why?

968
01:19:53,583 --> 01:19:55,949
It's Christmas.

969
01:19:59,389 --> 01:20:01,323
I could go get the bike.

970
01:20:01,391 --> 01:20:05,054
I'll walk.

971
01:20:05,128 --> 01:20:08,495
Simon?

972
01:20:53,943 --> 01:20:55,877
Simon?

973
01:20:58,047 --> 01:20:59,981
Simon!

974
01:21:01,451 --> 01:21:04,147
Simon!

975
01:21:04,220 --> 01:21:06,450
Simon's sick.

976
01:21:06,522 --> 01:21:11,289
- How sick?
- He's just sick, all right?

977
01:21:11,361 --> 01:21:13,921
But I've gotta see him
before I leave on the retreat.

978
01:21:13,997 --> 01:21:17,057
You can see him
when you get back.

979
01:21:17,133 --> 01:21:19,829
But can't I just come in
and see him for a couple seconds?

980
01:21:19,903 --> 01:21:21,837
Go on, now.

981
01:21:28,511 --> 01:21:30,445
Simon's sick.

982
01:21:30,513 --> 01:21:36,008
- I know.
- So was I when I heard
what he did last night.

983
01:21:36,085 --> 01:21:38,110
The whole town's
talkin' about it.

984
01:21:38,187 --> 01:21:40,121
What a little screwup.

985
01:21:44,327 --> 01:21:48,354
Hey! Your son is not a screwup.
He's a hero.

986
01:21:48,431 --> 01:21:51,366
What the hell
are you talking about?

987
01:21:51,434 --> 01:21:53,994
I said he's a hero.

988
01:21:54,070 --> 01:21:56,630
And you don't deserve him.

989
01:21:56,706 --> 01:21:58,640
I want you to know that.

990
01:22:09,819 --> 01:22:12,413
... six, seven,

991
01:22:12,488 --> 01:22:15,753
eight, nine,

992
01:22:15,825 --> 01:22:19,454
- ten, eleven,
- Thank you. And God bless you.

993
01:22:19,529 --> 01:22:22,054
twelve...

994
01:22:22,131 --> 01:22:24,065
Uh, is that it?

995
01:22:24,133 --> 01:22:27,466
- We're one short.
- Is that
supposed to be a joke?

996
01:22:31,474 --> 01:22:33,408
Have fun. Okay?

997
01:22:37,447 --> 01:22:40,382
- Please tell me you're coming.
- I just came to say good-bye.

998
01:22:40,450 --> 01:22:43,010
But what are you
gonna do without me?

999
01:22:43,086 --> 01:22:47,853
Well, first, I'm gonna sneak
into Reverend Russell's office
and get my baseball cards back.

1000
01:22:47,924 --> 01:22:51,155
Sounds like trouble.
Sorry I'm gonna miss it.

1001
01:22:58,301 --> 01:23:00,963
Well, I bet you boys are going
to be very sad to know that...

1002
01:23:01,037 --> 01:23:03,335
Miss Leavey has taken
a leave of absence.

1003
01:23:08,411 --> 01:23:10,572
She's going to spend some time
with her mother in Connecticut.

1004
01:23:10,646 --> 01:23:12,807
Okay, Joe. Let's go.

1005
01:23:12,882 --> 01:23:16,579
Simon, you should be home resting.

1006
01:23:20,656 --> 01:23:23,420
You better go.

1007
01:23:24,494 --> 01:23:27,019
Yeah.

1008
01:23:27,096 --> 01:23:30,532
- So, uh, I'll see ya
in a couple days, right?
- Sure.

1009
01:23:44,147 --> 01:23:47,742
- Get better, okay?
- Okay.

1010
01:24:11,074 --> 01:24:14,908
<i>I wish I could
remember every detail of that weekend.</i>

1011
01:24:14,977 --> 01:24:20,415
<i>Even now, I'll sometimes sit
and try to remember the colors,
the sounds, the faces.</i>

1012
01:24:20,483 --> 01:24:23,680
<i>But it only comes back to me
in bits and pieces.</i>

1013
01:24:23,753 --> 01:24:27,689
<i>If only I had known,
I would have paid closer attention.</i>

1014
01:24:27,757 --> 01:24:31,158
<i>But you're never prepared for
the moment that changes your life.</i>

1015
01:24:38,935 --> 01:24:41,495
Whoa. Hey. Hey, you okay?

1016
01:24:41,571 --> 01:24:44,301
Yeah.

1017
01:24:44,373 --> 01:24:47,672
- Take it slow.
- You're very good with them, Joe.

1018
01:24:47,743 --> 01:24:51,474
You should see Simon.
He's the one they really listen to.

1019
01:24:51,547 --> 01:24:56,484
Don't tell me you miss him
already. It's only been one day.

1020
01:24:56,552 --> 01:25:00,318
- He's my best friend.
- Yes, I know.

1021
01:25:29,752 --> 01:25:31,686
Gotcha!

1022
01:25:56,145 --> 01:25:58,943
- Miss Wenteworth.
And how did you end up...

1023
01:25:59,015 --> 01:26:02,246
with Simon Birch
as your best friend?

1024
01:26:02,318 --> 01:26:07,847
I don't know. Maybe it's because we both
know how it feels to be an outsider.

1025
01:26:07,924 --> 01:26:12,088
Teased or...
whispered about.

1026
01:26:12,161 --> 01:26:15,995
- They tease you?
- Yeah, you know, the Wenteworth bastard,

1027
01:26:16,065 --> 01:26:17,930
and stuff like that.

1028
01:26:22,438 --> 01:26:27,375
Well, people-people can be
very unforgiving at times, Joe, uh...

1029
01:26:28,878 --> 01:26:30,812
I'm sorry.

1030
01:26:34,817 --> 01:26:38,048
- Joe!
- Looks like somebody needs me.

1031
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:41,283
Joe.

1032
01:26:42,592 --> 01:26:46,392
You can talk to me...
anytime.

1033
01:27:03,045 --> 01:27:05,809
God, no wonder
she kept it such a secret.

1034
01:27:05,881 --> 01:27:08,509
You're sure we're doin'
the right thing, huh, Simon?

1035
01:27:08,584 --> 01:27:10,745
We promised him, Ben.

1036
01:27:11,631 --> 01:27:13,152
You promised him too, remember?

1037
01:27:13,222 --> 01:27:15,315
You're right. I did.

1038
01:27:25,234 --> 01:27:27,168
Reverend Russell?

1039
01:27:31,173 --> 01:27:33,107
Reverend?

1040
01:27:35,578 --> 01:27:39,139
Uh... I need the keys...

1041
01:27:39,215 --> 01:27:41,149
to the kitchen.

1042
01:27:44,086 --> 01:27:46,384
Reverend?

1043
01:28:12,281 --> 01:28:15,148
A lefty.

1044
01:28:15,217 --> 01:28:17,242
Just like me.

1045
01:28:23,726 --> 01:28:26,058
What do you mean?

1046
01:28:26,128 --> 01:28:31,430
I met your mother 13 years ago.
I was coming to Gravestown
to interview at the church.

1047
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:34,901
- No.
- She was going to the city to
buy a present for her mother.

1048
01:28:34,971 --> 01:28:37,405
Stop it.

1049
01:28:37,473 --> 01:28:41,739
I'd never seen anyone like her, Joe.
And I fell in love.

1050
01:28:41,811 --> 01:28:45,076
- Right there on
the Boston and Maine.
- Joe! Joe!

1051
01:28:45,147 --> 01:28:47,775
Simon.

1052
01:28:49,418 --> 01:28:51,716
Did you hear what he said?

1053
01:28:55,891 --> 01:28:58,018
He's lying, right?

1054
01:29:05,501 --> 01:29:07,696
Joe...

1055
01:29:09,672 --> 01:29:11,606
Joe!

1056
01:29:11,674 --> 01:29:13,608
Let him go, Reverend.

1057
01:29:15,211 --> 01:29:17,076
Joe.

1058
01:29:18,381 --> 01:29:19,961
Joe.

1059
01:29:21,283 --> 01:29:23,808
A bastard.

1060
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:28,117
I wish I never knew.

1061
01:29:28,190 --> 01:29:30,124
I wish I'd never found out.

1062
01:29:32,628 --> 01:29:35,563
- I must sound like a baby, huh?
- No.

1063
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:41,402
- Big goddamn baby.
- No, you don't.

1064
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:48,906
- I wish I could go home again.
- I know.

1065
01:29:48,978 --> 01:29:51,412
Back to the way things were.

1066
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:53,573
I know, pal.

1067
01:30:06,495 --> 01:30:08,895
I guess Simon's gonna ride
on the bus with Joe.

1068
01:30:12,902 --> 01:30:15,632
- He'll be all right.
- Ben, it was a mistake.

1069
01:30:18,340 --> 01:30:22,106
I wanted to take care of her,
but she said she didn't need that.

1070
01:30:23,979 --> 01:30:27,005
- Well, that sounds
a lot like Rebecca to me.
- Yeah.

1071
01:30:28,284 --> 01:30:31,742
Haunts me every day
of my life.

1072
01:30:31,821 --> 01:30:34,984
Wish I could take it back. l...

1073
01:30:35,057 --> 01:30:37,890
I just wish it never happened.

1074
01:30:40,096 --> 01:30:44,897
Well, there's a beautiful kid over there
who wouldn't be here if it hadn't.

1075
01:30:52,741 --> 01:30:55,574
Ben?

1076
01:31:01,150 --> 01:31:03,983
... eleven,

1077
01:31:05,087 --> 01:31:07,681
- twelve,
- and he ranks thirteen.

1078
01:31:07,756 --> 01:31:11,192
- Hey, you came.
- I told you I'd be here. Come on.

1079
01:31:15,906 --> 01:31:18,129
Up we go.

1080
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:20,134
Thanks.

1081
01:32:04,747 --> 01:32:07,580
You okay?

1082
01:32:07,650 --> 01:32:10,619
You okay?

1083
01:32:15,257 --> 01:32:18,158
I was thinking.

1084
01:32:18,227 --> 01:32:20,388
Maybe this was
your destiny.

1085
01:32:21,997 --> 01:32:24,727
To help me find my father.

1086
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:27,792
Yeah. Maybe.

1087
01:32:48,390 --> 01:32:52,156
...that our boys should be returning
home in just a matter of weeks.

1088
01:32:52,228 --> 01:32:54,856
- Come on. Give it back.
- You started it!

1089
01:32:54,930 --> 01:32:57,296
Calm down, guys.

1090
01:32:58,300 --> 01:33:00,291
Watch out!

1091
01:33:17,519 --> 01:33:19,612
Oh, God!

1092
01:33:22,891 --> 01:33:27,453
- I can't... I can't stop it!
I can't stop it!
- Oh, good Lord.

1093
01:33:41,744 --> 01:33:44,577
- Oh, no!
- Oh, my God!

1094
01:33:44,647 --> 01:33:46,672
Oh, good Lord!

1095
01:33:54,490 --> 01:33:56,822
Oh!

1096
01:34:04,767 --> 01:34:07,736
Reverend Russell!

1097
01:34:07,803 --> 01:34:10,795
I can't sw- I can't swim!

1098
01:34:16,679 --> 01:34:19,978
Hey, where are you going?
Come back.

1099
01:34:20,049 --> 01:34:22,882
Okay, everybody, just stay calm.
Okay. We're going to get out of here.

1100
01:34:22,951 --> 01:34:25,419
Hey, come on. Calm down.

1101
01:34:42,271 --> 01:34:44,398
Just listen to me.

1102
01:35:01,690 --> 01:35:04,557
Stop it!

1103
01:35:07,929 --> 01:35:12,559
I'm not going to let anything
happen to any of you. Understand?

1104
01:35:27,348 --> 01:35:29,816
Now, the current is very strong.

1105
01:35:29,884 --> 01:35:34,651
So I'll take you to Joe... one at
a time, and Joe will help you on shore.

1106
01:35:34,722 --> 01:35:36,986
- Go!
- Okay.

1107
01:35:46,668 --> 01:35:50,627
You first, now you.
You're after him.

1108
01:35:55,577 --> 01:35:58,410
Don't worry. It'll be okay.

1109
01:36:05,086 --> 01:36:07,646
I got you.

1110
01:36:07,722 --> 01:36:10,520
Now, you. Come on.
Let's go. You're next.

1111
01:36:16,030 --> 01:36:18,863
Well, that's it. Come on.
Simon, let's go.

1112
01:36:18,933 --> 01:36:20,867
Wait. We're missing one.

1113
01:36:33,348 --> 01:36:36,044
Simon!

1114
01:36:39,954 --> 01:36:42,548
Joe!

1115
01:37:10,752 --> 01:37:12,879
My foot's stuck.
I'm scared.

1116
01:37:12,954 --> 01:37:15,184
Hang on.

1117
01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:35,571
- Aah!
- Come on. I got ya.

1118
01:38:25,393 --> 01:38:27,327
Come on, Stuart.

1119
01:38:29,998 --> 01:38:32,831
It's okay.

1120
01:38:32,900 --> 01:38:34,993
I got him.

1121
01:38:35,069 --> 01:38:37,128
- Where's Simon?
- He's inside. I'll get him.

1122
01:38:37,205 --> 01:38:40,766
- No, no! Let me.
- Simon!

1123
01:38:40,842 --> 01:38:43,402
Get him. Get him, Joe.

1124
01:38:45,179 --> 01:38:48,012
Pull him through the window.

1125
01:38:48,082 --> 01:38:50,516
Pull him out, Joe.

1126
01:38:51,919 --> 01:38:55,980
- Joe!
- Simon!
- No, no, no, Simon!

1127
01:38:56,057 --> 01:38:57,991
Simon!

1128
01:38:59,227 --> 01:39:01,320
Let me.

1129
01:39:04,499 --> 01:39:08,959
Simon!

1130
01:39:09,037 --> 01:39:10,971
Joe!

1131
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:20,714
Simon!

1132
01:39:27,422 --> 01:39:31,188
Simon!

1133
01:39:31,259 --> 01:39:33,454
Okay, Joe.
Keep his head above the water.

1134
01:39:40,535 --> 01:39:43,766
Hmm. Hmm.

1135
01:39:54,449 --> 01:39:56,508
- Get 'em up to the road.
- What about Joe?

1136
01:39:56,584 --> 01:39:58,916
We got him. Joe!

1137
01:39:58,986 --> 01:40:01,318
Come with me, boys.

1138
01:40:01,389 --> 01:40:05,485
Here. Down here.
Here. Hurry!

1139
01:40:07,762 --> 01:40:10,162
Come on.

1140
01:40:10,231 --> 01:40:12,199
Come here, children.

1141
01:40:16,104 --> 01:40:17,969
Come on. Come on.

1142
01:40:21,709 --> 01:40:23,700
Come on.

1143
01:40:25,646 --> 01:40:27,773
Come on.

1144
01:40:29,884 --> 01:40:31,818
Come on, Joe.

1145
01:40:31,886 --> 01:40:33,854
Simon.

1146
01:40:36,190 --> 01:40:39,284
Don't leave me.

1147
01:41:26,207 --> 01:41:29,108
I want to see Simon.

1148
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:40,653
Father Russell,

1149
01:41:44,492 --> 01:41:46,426
I'll see you on Sunday.

1150
01:42:14,722 --> 01:42:18,123
He's got a visitor.

1151
01:42:18,192 --> 01:42:20,717
Simon...

1152
01:42:20,795 --> 01:42:25,494
I heard what you did
for those kids.

1153
01:42:25,566 --> 01:42:30,503
The whole town's
talking about it.

1154
01:42:32,607 --> 01:42:36,941
I just wanted
you to know...

1155
01:42:37,011 --> 01:42:41,311
that I think what you did...
was really brave.

1156
01:42:58,232 --> 01:43:01,599
And you're a hero,

1157
01:43:01,669 --> 01:43:03,603
Simon Birch.

1158
01:43:48,183 --> 01:43:50,583
Jesus, Simon,

1159
01:43:50,652 --> 01:43:52,586
you look like shit.

1160
01:44:02,197 --> 01:44:04,131
Hey.

1161
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:07,134
Hey.

1162
01:44:07,202 --> 01:44:09,227
Are the kids okay?

1163
01:44:09,304 --> 01:44:11,238
Yeah.

1164
01:44:11,306 --> 01:44:13,240
They all made it?

1165
01:44:13,308 --> 01:44:15,833
Even Stuart.

1166
01:44:15,911 --> 01:44:20,348
Did you see how
the children listened to me...

1167
01:44:20,415 --> 01:44:22,474
because of the way I looked?

1168
01:44:22,551 --> 01:44:25,645
Yeah.

1169
01:44:28,223 --> 01:44:30,350
That window
was just my size.

1170
01:44:30,425 --> 01:44:32,359
Extra small.

1171
01:44:32,427 --> 01:44:35,692
Extra, extra small.

1172
01:44:39,001 --> 01:44:43,438
That was
over 200 Mississippi.

1173
01:44:43,505 --> 01:44:47,373
Nobody likes a showoff.

1174
01:44:47,442 --> 01:44:49,637
Promise me.

1175
01:44:49,711 --> 01:44:52,305
Yeah.

1176
01:44:52,381 --> 01:44:54,679
- You'll take my baseball cards.
- No.

1177
01:44:54,750 --> 01:44:58,516
Take them and share them
with Ben. Please?

1178
01:45:01,690 --> 01:45:05,626
Okay. I promise.

1179
01:45:08,397 --> 01:45:10,331
Simon?

1180
01:45:10,399 --> 01:45:14,335
Yeah.

1181
01:45:14,403 --> 01:45:17,702
You're the best friend
I ever had.

1182
01:45:17,773 --> 01:45:19,900
I know that, stupid.

1183
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:27,512
- Joe?
- Yeah.

1184
01:45:27,583 --> 01:45:29,517
I got to go now.

1185
01:45:32,321 --> 01:45:34,516
Okay.

1186
01:45:34,590 --> 01:45:37,354
See you later, alligator.

1187
01:46:57,205 --> 01:46:59,264
Timber-r-r!

1188
01:47:10,719 --> 01:47:13,017
One year good luck.

1189
01:47:13,088 --> 01:47:15,113
<i>Winter left its icy chill behind.</i>

1190
01:47:15,190 --> 01:47:18,250
<i>And soon it was spring
and summer again.</i>

1191
01:47:18,327 --> 01:47:20,261
<i>Grandmother passed away
that June...</i>

1192
01:47:20,329 --> 01:47:22,263
<i>following a stroke.</i>

1193
01:47:22,331 --> 01:47:25,823
<i>And because Hildie was always
so content to just follow her lead,</i>

1194
01:47:25,901 --> 01:47:28,734
<i>she had a stroke of her own
and died in July.</i>

1195
01:47:28,804 --> 01:47:31,102
<i>We buried them
side by side.</i>

1196
01:47:31,173 --> 01:47:33,141
<i>It's the way
they would have wanted it.</i>

1197
01:47:33,208 --> 01:47:35,142
<i>Ben Goodrich legally
adopted me...</i>

1198
01:47:35,210 --> 01:47:38,839
<i>just two days
before my 13th birthday.</i>

1199
01:47:38,914 --> 01:47:43,351
<i>Not a day goes by that I don't
thank God for bringing him into my life.</i>

1200
01:47:45,187 --> 01:47:49,214
<i>With Simon's help,
I'd finally found my real father.</i>

1201
01:48:23,892 --> 01:48:26,793
<i>There is a prayer
I say for Simon Birch.</i>

1202
01:48:26,862 --> 01:48:29,092
<i>It's the same prayer
that he said at my mother's grave...</i>

1203
01:48:29,164 --> 01:48:33,294
<i>that night I found him
in the darkness.</i>

1204
01:48:33,368 --> 01:48:36,701
Into paradise...

1205
01:48:36,772 --> 01:48:40,765
may the angels lead you.

1206
01:48:55,323 --> 01:48:57,257
Dad?

1207
01:48:57,325 --> 01:48:59,919
Dad! I'd love to stay here
in the graveyard all day,

1208
01:48:59,995 --> 01:49:01,929
but I've got a game, remember?

1209
01:49:04,766 --> 01:49:07,234
Okay, Simon.
I'm coming.

1210
01:49:07,302 --> 01:49:09,236
You know, I was just thinking
about that.

1211
01:49:09,304 --> 01:49:11,238
Last year, you played
in the squirt league, right?

1212
01:49:11,306 --> 01:49:14,400
- Yeah. So?
- This year you're a peewee.

1213
01:49:14,476 --> 01:49:16,944
So, what do they want you to do,
play soccer or urinate?

1214
01:49:19,181 --> 01:49:21,615
Anyway...
I was just thinking.
