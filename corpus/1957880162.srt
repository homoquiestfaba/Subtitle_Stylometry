IT'S GOING
TO BE OKAY.

THAT'S A STUPID THING
TO SAY.

WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO SAY?

HOW ABOUT,
"RICK, YOU'RE A LOSER,"

OR "RICK YOU'RE A.."

IT WASN'T
YOUR FAULT.

896
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:12,100
BILLY DECIDED
TO GO RIDING
ALL BY HIMSELF.

897
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,340
BECAUSE I DITCHED HIM
FOR YOU.

898
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:19,110
I WAS SUPPOSED TO
TAKE HIM RIDING,
LAST NIGHT.

01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:34,990
THE DAY MY DAD
HAD A HEART ATTACK

900

I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
CLEANING THE BARN.

901
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:40,560
TYPICAL RICK,
WENT AND PLAYED BALL.

902
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:47,240
FOUND HIM
IN THE STABLES
WITH HIS FACE DOWN

903
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:49,210
AND ARMS
STRETCHED OUT

904
01:05:49,310 --> 01:05:51,710
LIKE HE WAS
GOING FOR HELP.

905
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:55,710
HE ALWAYS SAID
I COULDN'T
BE RELIED ON.

906
01:05:55,810 --> 01:05:57,650
EVEN IF YOU'D
BEEN THERE,

907

WHO KNOWS IF YOU
COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING.

908
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:02,790
THAT'S THE
WHOLE POINT.

I DON'T KNOW
AND I NEVER WILL

910
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:08,820
BECAUSE I
WASN'T THERE.

911

I DID THE SAME
THING WITH BILLY.

IF I WOULD HAVE
JUST TAKEN HIM
RIDING LAST NIGHT

913
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:18,330
NONE OF THIS
WOULD EVER HAPPENED.

IT'S DIFFERENT
THIS TIME.

BECAUSE OF YOU.

WHAT?

1240
01:27:07,580 --> 01:27:09,220
YOU'RE GONNA
THROW AWAY OUR PLANS,

1241
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:11,090
THROW AWAY
YOUR FREEDOM,

1242
01:27:11,190 --> 01:27:13,150
TO WATCH
SOME BLIND GIRL
RIDE A PONY?

1243
01:27:14,190 --> 01:27:17,130
IF THAT'S THE WAY
YOU WANT TO PUT IT, YEAH.

1244
01:27:17,230 --> 01:27:20,830
YOUR PRIORITIES
ARE WAY SCREWED UP, MAN.

1245
01:27:20,930 --> 01:27:24,530
COME ON, BLITZ,
FORGET ABOUT HIM.

1246
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:33,880
I DON'T KNOW
YOU, MAN.

1247
01:27:43,390 --> 01:27:45,790
ALL RIGHT COWBOY,
HERE SHE GOES.

1248
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:47,860
CROSS YOUR FINGERS.

[ Crowd cheers ]

1250
01:28:15,850 --> 01:28:17,820
ALL RIGHT, LINDSAY!

1251
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:20,220
YEE HAW!

1252
01:28:21,730 --> 01:28:24,290
Number 28
has cleared the jump.

1253
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:27,600
How about a hand
for Lindsay Kurtz on Ghost.

1254
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:41,710
HEY, WE DIDN'T DO
NOTHING, MAN.

1255
01:28:41,810 --> 01:28:44,050
YOU GUYS UNDERESTIMATE
YOURSELVES.

1256
01:28:44,150 --> 01:28:45,980
YOUR ESCAPE WAS
DEFINITELY SOMETHING.

1257
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:46,980
COME ON.

1258
01:28:50,890 --> 01:28:52,990
THERE YOU GO.

1259
01:28:53,090 --> 01:28:53,790
YOU FINISHED.

1260
01:28:53,890 --> 01:28:55,890
NEXT YEAR,
I'LL PLACE FIRST.

1261
01:28:55,990 --> 01:28:58,690
YOU JUST MIGHT, TOO.

1262
01:29:08,100 --> 01:29:10,840
We'd like
to thanks our sponsors

1263
01:29:10,940 --> 01:29:14,280
for their generosity
in the individual prizes
awarded today.

1264
01:29:14,610 --> 01:29:19,180
I HEARD YOU WERE
PLANNING A TRIP
TO NEW YORK.

1265
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:22,180
GOOD THING YOU
DECIDED NOT TO GO.

1266
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:25,020
YOUR PALS ARE TAKING
A LITTLE DETOUR.

1267
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:28,520
[ Annie: ]
I JUST TALKED
TO BUSTER.

1268
01:29:28,630 --> 01:29:31,890
HE SAID
HE COULDN'T STAND
TO LET CAL TORTURE GHOST

1269
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,630
SO HE LET RICK
HAVE THE HORSE.

1270
01:29:34,730 --> 01:29:36,370
HE DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING BEFORE

1271
01:29:36,470 --> 01:29:38,900
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT
HE'D LOSE HIS JOB.

1272
01:29:40,140 --> 01:29:44,970
GO ON,
TAKE YOUR LAP, COACH.

1273
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:52,980
THANK YOU, MACK.

1274
01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:57,650
YOU KNOW,

1275
01:29:57,750 --> 01:30:00,250
I COULD USE A
PERMANENT STABLE BOY.

1276
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:02,760
MAYBE WE COULD
DISCUSS THIS OVER DINNER.

1277
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:05,690
MAYBE.

1278
01:30:07,260 --> 01:30:10,900
DO YOU COOK
ANYTHING OTHER
THAN BANANA PANCAKES?

1279
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,300
NO.

1280
01:30:14,810 --> 01:30:18,540
BUT I DO
A MEAN TAKE OUT.
