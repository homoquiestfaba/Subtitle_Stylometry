<i>Jennifer: I call that payback</i>

181
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,477
<i>for you gloating about me
moving back to New York.</i>

182
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:41,848
I wasn't gloating so much
as rubbing your face in it.

183
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,652
Look, I considered it
all evolution for me.

184
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,622
Colorado taught me everything
I needed to learn.

185
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:49,923
Enlighten me.

186
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,492
Solitude and fresh air suck.

187
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,593
[laughs]

188
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,029
So now that you've finally
come to your senses,

189
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:59,099
are you ready to get back
into the New York dating scene?

190
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:00,234
Yeah. Maybe.

191
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,501
Do you have somebody
in mind?

192
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:02,435
I do.

193
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,838
He's a little bit older,
ridiculously smart,

194
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:06,339
ridiculously handsome.

195
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:07,440
My god, what's wrong
with him?

196
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:09,476
Nothing. He's an old
family friend.

197
00:10:09,543 --> 00:10:12,012
Just won't be available
for another four months.

198
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,248
Three with good behavior.

199
00:10:14,282 --> 00:10:15,882
You've got to be kidding me.

200
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,350
He made a stupid mistake.

201
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:19,119
In most states
it's not even a crime.

202
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:20,587
Totally white collar.

203
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:22,656
That is a firm no,
Audrey.

204
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:25,358
I'd grab him for myself
if I was still single.

205
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:28,461
Look, I am 35 but
I am not desperate.

206
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:30,063
Okay. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

207
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:34,134
So, what are your plans now that
you're back in civilization?

208
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,237
You know, the usual.

209
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,470
Finish the great American novel.

210
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:40,274
Once that's out of the way,
in between talk shows

211
00:10:40,308 --> 00:10:43,610
I'll meet the perfect
non-incarcerated man.

212
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,412
The Dalai Lama will officiate
the wedding.

213
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,680
Nothing too big.

214
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:49,616
Then three kids,
international acclaim,

215
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:51,051
and, I guess, immortality?

216
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,221
I mean, I haven't really
given it that much thought.

217
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:54,421
Yeah.

218
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,224
That's the Jennifer
I know and love.

220
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,927
Yeah, except it'll happen
before I'm 40 and not 30.

- Fotis.
- Who's Fotis?

224
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:10,437
To what do I owe?

225
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,039
<i>Fotis: I'm looking at a picture

226

<i>Is that you I see at
the Met event last night?</i>

227
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,511
Um, maybe?

228
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:20,547
Yeah. I, I made an appearance.

229

<i>Fotis: So, you're here

230

232
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:34,328
Hey. I'm just on my way
out the door.

Fotis, hey.

234
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,999
I, I'm so sorry but I think we
have to do this another time.

235
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,001
I've come down with something.

236
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,035
Oh no.

237
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:45,206
Um, what can I do for you?

238
00:11:45,273 --> 00:11:46,139
I'm all right.

239
00:11:46,207 --> 00:11:48,608
I just-I'm sorry we have
to cancel.

240
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:49,876
Yeah.

Fotis?

245
00:12:04,258 --> 00:12:06,760
Beware of Greeks bearing gifts.

246
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:09,029
What are you doing here?

247
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:12,632
Just some necessities
in a time of need.

248
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,168
You should've called first.
I look like hell.

249
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:17,938
Well, if I called you would have
told me not to come over.

250

Well, yeah of course.

Okay.

Oh, my gosh, those flowers
are so pretty.

257
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,928

this for you.

Oh.

- First.
- Thank you.

There you go.

Okay.

266
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,152
Chicken soup from Kat's Deli.

267
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,655
I'm going to heat this up
for you.

268
00:13:09,423 --> 00:13:13,260
This is the Greek cure
for cold and flu.

269
00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:15,528
Some of this with a little bit
of honey and cinnamon

270
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,431
and you'll be doing backflips.

271
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,099
You will also be
a little drunk.

Oh...

I think it's the one.

Where is Mom's head on Fotis

Yeah. I guess so.

297
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:24,631
You guess so?
That's encouraging.

298
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:26,233
I mean they might think
this whole thing

299
00:14:26,267 --> 00:14:28,134

300
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:32,339

I think maybe I saw you
ending up with, you know,

306
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:43,350
like a senator or an editor
from Simon and Schuster.

307
00:14:43,384 --> 00:14:45,752
Not, you know, a water skier.

What are you trying

315
00:14:59,966 --> 00:15:01,935
You've known him
less than a year.

316
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,070
I just wouldn't want to think
that you're settling

317
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:06,072
because you've reached
a certain age.

318

There, I said it.

319
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,875

I know, and I love you
to pieces for that.

How do you know he's not
marrying you for your money?

328
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:28,962
How does he know I'm not
marrying him just to have kids?

Are you?

330
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:32,165

better than that.

Look, look.
Here is my answer.

333
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,838
I love Fotis.

334
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,541
I don't just want
to have a family.

335
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:43,244
I want to have a family

336
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,911
I don't need a senator.

337
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:48,282
You know, I'm not
perfect either.

338

We're going to make a great
family together.

Look, I knew when I got married

533
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:28,188
I would have to give up
certain freedoms.

534
00:26:28,256 --> 00:26:29,289
Selfishness.

00:26:29,322 --> 00:26:31,291
Oh, so now I'm selfish too.
Is that it?

00:26:31,358 --> 00:26:33,059
Yeah. You could give a little.

00:43:54,734 --> 00:43:56,204
Maybe one day
you'll come home

886
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:58,672
to an empty house
like I did, hmm?

887
00:43:58,738 --> 00:44:00,540
Only your kids won't be
in the next state,

888
00:44:00,574 --> 00:44:02,576
they'll be with me on the other
side of the ocean

889
00:44:02,642 --> 00:44:05,078
where you're never going
to see them again!

890
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,348
I'll remember to mention
to my lawyer

891
00:44:08,415 --> 00:44:10,851
that you threatened to kidnap
my children.

892
00:44:10,917 --> 00:44:11,818
<i>Really?</i>

893
00:44:11,885 --> 00:44:13,486
Why stop there?

894
00:44:14,621 --> 00:44:18,024
Why not tell them I threatened
to kill you too, hmm?

895
00:44:24,464 --> 00:44:27,567
How does that make sense?
He threatened your life.

896
00:44:27,634 --> 00:44:30,904
Well, according to our great
legal system

897
00:44:30,971 --> 00:44:32,672
it's a very common phrase.

898
00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:33,874
They can't take custody away

899
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:36,076
from everyone who says
"I'm going to kill you."

900
00:44:36,142 --> 00:44:37,211
So he gets shared custody

901
00:44:37,278 --> 00:44:38,845
even though he chased you
through the house

902
00:44:38,879 --> 00:44:41,147
and tried to break down the
bedroom door to get to you?

903
00:44:41,215 --> 00:44:42,515
He didn't lay a hand on me.

904
00:44:42,582 --> 00:44:44,384
Isn't that at least enough
to get, you know,

905
00:44:44,451 --> 00:44:46,720
like an emergency
restraining order?

906
00:44:46,753 --> 00:44:48,989
He's allowed to break
his own door.

907
00:44:50,156 --> 00:44:51,191
Great.

908
00:44:51,259 --> 00:44:53,627
They'll act when they find you
dead in the gutter.

909
00:44:53,693 --> 00:44:57,265
I don't think we need
to worry about that.

910
00:44:57,331 --> 00:44:59,733
Listen, the marriage is ending

911
00:44:59,766 --> 00:45:02,669
and that's the most
important thing.

912
00:45:03,304 --> 00:45:04,537
Yeah.

913
00:45:06,207 --> 00:45:07,474
[sighs]

914
00:45:10,211 --> 00:45:11,845
Leaving Fotis for Jennifer

915
00:45:11,912 --> 00:45:15,048
was like flipping
the creative switch.

916
00:45:15,115 --> 00:45:18,818
<i>Turns out she could be a mother
and a writer at the same time.</i>

917
00:45:18,885 --> 00:45:21,322
<i>She started a whole new novel,
I read some of it.</i>

918
00:45:21,389 --> 00:45:22,956
It was good.

919
00:45:24,057 --> 00:45:27,727
<i>It was about a desperate woman
in a failed marriage.</i>

920
00:45:28,662 --> 00:45:31,265
Boy, where does she come up
with these ideas?

921
00:45:31,332 --> 00:45:32,565
Hmm.

922
00:45:35,168 --> 00:45:36,202
Okay.

923
00:45:39,539 --> 00:45:41,474
Okay, here you go, baby girl.

924
00:45:41,508 --> 00:45:43,743
- Hey.
- Okay, here you go.

925
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:45,045
Hey.

926
00:45:45,111 --> 00:45:46,713
Hey buddy, how are you?

927
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,182
You go on ahead, okay?
I'll be right there.

928
00:45:52,253 --> 00:45:54,187
- You go inside.
- Hi.

929
00:45:54,255 --> 00:45:56,189
Hi, go with your brother.

930
00:45:56,656 --> 00:45:57,524
Hey.

931
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:58,825
Hey guys, go on, there's pizza
inside, okay?

932
00:45:58,892 --> 00:45:59,659
I'll be right in.

933
00:45:59,693 --> 00:46:00,493
Go get some pizza!

934
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,263
Bye sweetie,
I love you.

935
00:46:02,562 --> 00:46:04,931
Yeah, go on in.

936
00:46:09,002 --> 00:46:10,971
Mind if I drop off the kids
later on Sunday?

937
00:46:11,037 --> 00:46:12,138
There's a carnival.

938
00:46:12,206 --> 00:46:14,140
I hear your girlfriend and her
daughter are living here now.

939
00:46:14,174 --> 00:46:15,409
What are you talking about?

940
00:46:15,475 --> 00:46:16,576
I mean, come on Fotis.

941
00:46:16,609 --> 00:46:19,546
You didn't think things
would get back to me?

942
00:46:19,612 --> 00:46:21,215
Michelle and Elaine
are just visiting.

943
00:46:21,248 --> 00:46:23,351
We had an agreement.
When it comes to our kids...

944
00:46:23,417 --> 00:46:24,452
Fine!

945
00:46:24,517 --> 00:46:25,618
Fine, listen.

946
00:46:25,685 --> 00:46:26,987
I am with Michelle now,

947
00:46:27,053 --> 00:46:29,189
and if I want her to live with
me she's going to live with me.

948
00:46:29,223 --> 00:46:32,293
You don't have to like it,
but that's the way it is.

949
00:46:32,326 --> 00:46:33,059
Oh, is it?

950
00:46:33,126 --> 00:46:34,160
It is.

951
00:46:41,268 --> 00:46:43,870
You asked your children to
deliberately lie to their mother

952
00:46:43,937 --> 00:46:46,573
about your violation
of this court's order?

953
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:47,741
Your Honor, if I may.

954
00:46:47,774 --> 00:46:50,110
Counsellor, would you kindly
remind your client

955
00:46:50,176 --> 00:46:51,845
he had his turn to speak?

956
00:46:51,911 --> 00:46:52,812
Okay.

957
00:46:52,846 --> 00:46:55,615
I'm ordering that shared custody
be terminated

958
00:46:55,682 --> 00:46:57,717
and that the mother be given
full custody

959
00:46:57,751 --> 00:46:58,918
from this date forward.

960
00:46:58,985 --> 00:46:59,853
Full custody!

961
00:46:59,886 --> 00:47:02,188
Your Honor, that's
completely unfair.

962
00:47:02,223 --> 00:47:03,623
You would give full custody

963
00:47:03,656 --> 00:47:05,692
to a woman who abuses
antidepressants!

964
00:47:05,725 --> 00:47:07,794
She has mental health issues!

965
00:47:07,861 --> 00:47:09,996
This is such a load of crap!
You call this justice?

966
00:47:10,063 --> 00:47:11,798
Continue with this outburst,
Mr. Dulos,

967
00:47:11,865 --> 00:47:13,700
and I'll find you in contempt.

968
00:47:13,767 --> 00:47:16,169
My client is understandably
upset, Your Honor.

969
00:47:16,237 --> 00:47:17,170
Mr. Dulos.

970
00:47:17,238 --> 00:47:19,240
You don't seem to appreciate
the consequences of

971
00:47:19,306 --> 00:47:22,675
lying under oath and willfully
violating a court order.

972
00:47:22,742 --> 00:47:24,744
Your behavior constitutes

973
00:47:24,778 --> 00:47:27,348
emotional abuse
of your children.

974
00:47:27,415 --> 00:47:29,783
I said "don't tell Mom"
and I winked.

975
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:31,318
You're telling me
that's emotional abuse?

976
00:47:31,385 --> 00:47:34,154
<i>Judge: Their mother shall have
sole physical custody</i>

977
00:47:34,187 --> 00:47:37,458
<i>and the final word on all
decisions involving them.</i>

978
00:47:37,525 --> 00:47:39,159
<i>Court adjourned.</i>

979
00:47:39,692 --> 00:47:40,627
[gavel slams]

980
00:47:40,693 --> 00:47:41,795
<i>Judge: Get your client
out of here</i>

981
00:47:41,861 --> 00:47:43,963
<i>before he does more damage
to himself.</i>

982
00:48:00,414 --> 00:48:01,648
You're not supposed
to be here, Fotis.

983
00:48:01,714 --> 00:48:03,583
What's this I hear you changed
the kids' doctor?

984
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:05,453
Yeah, I did. I made
that decision.

985
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:06,487
Don't you think you
should've consulted me

986
00:48:06,554 --> 00:48:07,954
before you signed them up
for hockey?

987
00:48:08,021 --> 00:48:10,391
Once again, I made
that decision.

988
00:48:10,458 --> 00:48:11,891
I have sole custody.

989
00:48:11,958 --> 00:48:13,527
And I'm still their father.

990
00:48:13,593 --> 00:48:15,229
I understand that.

991
00:48:15,296 --> 00:48:16,729
Their mother
has sole custody.

992
00:48:16,796 --> 00:48:18,731
You should leave.

993
00:48:36,749 --> 00:48:38,452
[engine roars]

994
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:39,619
Ahhhhhh!

995
00:48:42,155 --> 00:48:43,123
My god!

996
00:48:43,189 --> 00:48:45,226
[gasping]

997
00:48:49,696 --> 00:48:51,197
Two and a half million dollars?

998
00:48:51,265 --> 00:48:52,366
Where the hell does
Jennifer's mother think

999
00:48:52,399 --> 00:48:54,368
I'm supposed to come up
with that kind of money?

1000
00:48:54,435 --> 00:48:55,269
This is, I don't even...

1001
00:48:55,336 --> 00:48:56,604
I don't have enough
legal troubles with Jen,

1002
00:48:56,669 --> 00:48:59,806
now I have a lawsuit
with her mother too?

1003
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:01,375
It wasn't a damn loan.

1004
00:49:01,442 --> 00:49:02,942
She invested
in the business.

1005
00:49:03,009 --> 00:49:03,776
Yes.

1006
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:05,745
Every penny is tied up
in these houses.

1007
00:49:05,812 --> 00:49:07,180
The courts will see that.

1008
00:49:07,248 --> 00:49:08,114
The courts?

1009
00:49:08,181 --> 00:49:09,115
[scoffs]

1010
00:49:09,182 --> 00:49:09,983
Yeah.

1011
00:49:10,049 --> 00:49:11,585
Whoever has the most money
wins in court.

1012
00:49:11,619 --> 00:49:12,952
That's not true, Fotis.

1013
00:49:13,019 --> 00:49:15,389
Her mother is giving her
75 grand a month

1014
00:49:15,456 --> 00:49:17,857
to spend on lawyers
to torture me.

1015
00:49:17,924 --> 00:49:19,527
How am I supposed to compete
with that?

1016
00:49:19,593 --> 00:49:20,327
Okay.

1017
00:49:20,394 --> 00:49:21,328
I mean, Jesus Christ.

1018
00:49:21,395 --> 00:49:23,531
I'm already in the hole
practically seven million.

1019
00:49:23,597 --> 00:49:25,332
You need to relax, Fotis.

1020
00:49:25,366 --> 00:49:26,733
You can handle this.

1021
00:49:26,799 --> 00:49:31,205
Let's just focus on one issue
at a time.

1022
00:49:31,238 --> 00:49:34,107
I know, it's just...

1023
00:49:34,174 --> 00:49:35,942
I just...

1024
00:49:37,511 --> 00:49:41,315
I know. I think it's just-
it's hitting me all at once.

1025
00:49:41,348 --> 00:49:43,683
Let me help you relax.

1026
00:49:52,526 --> 00:49:54,827
Goddamn it.

1027
00:49:54,894 --> 00:49:56,530
Jennifer's trying to ruin
my life.

1028
00:49:56,597 --> 00:49:59,032
Fotis, come on.

1029
00:50:11,278 --> 00:50:13,480
Sometimes I just...

1030
00:50:13,547 --> 00:50:17,318
I just wish she'd disappear,
you know?

1031
00:50:22,323 --> 00:50:24,023
<i>I feel safe in my new home
in New Caanan.</i>

1032
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:26,427
<i>Seventy miles away from Fotis.</i>

1033
00:50:26,493 --> 00:50:29,463
<i>I need warm sand
between my toes.</i>

1034
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:31,097
<i>Someplace tropical.</i>

1035
00:50:31,164 --> 00:50:33,199
<i>Someplace with hammocks
between palm trees</i>

1036
00:50:33,267 --> 00:50:36,903
<i>and water so clear it doesn't
even look real.</i>

1037
00:50:36,936 --> 00:50:41,140
<i>Warm ocean breezes, papaya.</i>

1038
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:43,142
<i>I always get
self-conscious these days</i>

1039
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:46,380
<i>when I put on a bikini,
my dear blog readers.</i>

1040
00:50:46,447 --> 00:50:50,750
<i>But I'm thinking about a place
where it just doesn't matter.</i>

1041
00:50:53,454 --> 00:50:54,787
Mr. Dulos?

1042
00:50:54,854 --> 00:50:57,358
Yes? Who are you?

1043
00:50:57,424 --> 00:50:58,191
Come in.

1044
00:50:58,225 --> 00:51:00,661
I'm here to supervise
your visit.

1045
00:51:00,728 --> 00:51:01,662
You're here to what?

1046
00:51:01,729 --> 00:51:03,464
I'm a monitor appointed
by the court.

1047
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:07,368
I'll be along on all future
visits with your children.

1048
00:51:07,735 --> 00:51:09,503
Jennifer?!

1049
00:51:11,338 --> 00:51:12,539
What the hell is this?

1050
00:51:12,573 --> 00:51:13,973
She's the court monitor.

1051
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,174
Did you request this?

1052
00:51:15,242 --> 00:51:17,444
I have reason to believe
you'll run off with my kids.

1053
00:51:17,478 --> 00:51:18,379
Oh, come on.

1054
00:51:18,445 --> 00:51:19,446
You threatened to do that once,
if you recall.

1055
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:20,714
You're doing this out of spite.

1056
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,549
"They'll be with me on the other
side of the ocean

1057
00:51:22,616 --> 00:51:24,150
"where you'll never see
them again."

1058
00:51:24,218 --> 00:51:27,920
You didn't say those
exact words?

1059
00:51:27,987 --> 00:51:29,822

into the record

your wife over with your car.

<i>Without an eyewitness I have
to take it as hearsay.</i>

<i>However given your behavior

00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:11,157
We were intimate there,
you could say.

1091
00:53:14,294 --> 00:53:18,665
I fed my daughter breakfast
and I dropped her off at school.

Adios, mi amore.

1093

That would be around 8:15.

1095

About an hour later I went
to pick up some groceries

1096

on several of his work sites

the truth,
