[crowd cheering, whistling]

171
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:30,533
[Jackie shrieking]

172
00:12:37,075 --> 00:12:39,783
- [Desi] Let go of me!
- [Jackie panting]

173
00:12:41,116 --> 00:12:42,408
Get the fuck off me!

174
00:12:43,283 --> 00:12:45,033
- Can we go now?
- [man] She beat her?

175
00:12:45,741 --> 00:12:46,533
Huh?

176
00:12:46,658 --> 00:12:48,700
[Jackie panting]

177
00:12:54,075 --> 00:12:56,533
- I ain't never gonna forgive you.
- [laughing] For what, babe?

178
00:12:56,658 --> 00:12:58,741
- For this shit.
- Look at you. What you talkin' about?

179
00:12:58,866 --> 00:13:00,700
- You're alive again.
- Uh-uh.

180
00:13:00,825 --> 00:13:02,533
Come here, baby. Come on.
Come on. Come here.

181
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:05,033
It's all right. It's all right.
Look at that.

182
00:13:05,158 --> 00:13:06,950
Why don't I get that for you?

183
00:13:07,575 --> 00:13:08,741
Okay. Okay. Okay.

184
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:10,866
- [knocking]
- [Desi] Oh, shit.

185
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,450
Wow.

186
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,741
[hisses]

187
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:23,408
So... you got a trainer?

188
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:26,783
- No. I ain't interest...
- No, no. What she means to say is...

189
00:13:26,908 --> 00:13:29,075
Well, look here.
I run Invicta FC.

190
00:13:30,033 --> 00:13:32,158
The biggest female league
in the game. You know?

191
00:13:32,283 --> 00:13:33,991
[laughing] Shit, we know
who you are, man.

192
00:13:34,116 --> 00:13:36,241
Hey, here,
you better take my card.

193
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:38,158
I'm her manager.
You call me, all right? Here.

194
00:13:41,116 --> 00:13:43,450
Yeah. Look. Take my card.

195
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:47,158
I want you to contact
my top trainer Buddhakan. Okay?

196
00:13:49,783 --> 00:13:51,116
Yo, I love what you
did in there, son.

197
00:13:51,241 --> 00:13:53,325
That shit was cold, man.
For real.

198
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:55,075
Bom-bom. Damn.

199
00:13:56,866 --> 00:13:59,116
You used to be in the UFC, huh?

200
00:13:59,241 --> 00:14:00,658
Yeah, I got mad love
for the UFC.

201
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,033
Look, how about this?

202
00:14:04,158 --> 00:14:08,783
How about you fight in my league,
and I'll get you back in the UFC?

203
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,408
Ha, you don't think
I'm for real, huh? [chuckles]

204
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:15,533
Here. Hold on one second.

205
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,325
[blows]

206
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,366
Wow.

207
00:14:21,491 --> 00:14:22,866
What's that shit they say?

208
00:14:24,075 --> 00:14:26,450
"Future's so bright," huh? Pow!

209
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,825
Go see Buddhakan.

210
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,533
The fuck was that, baby?

211
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:36,533
You did that shit!
You fucking did that shit. [laughs]

212
00:14:37,741 --> 00:14:38,658
Fuck.

213
00:14:44,408 --> 00:14:45,616
Let's get the fuck outta here.

214
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,741
- [tires screech]
- [Jackie] Ow!

215
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:01,450
Oh, God.

216
00:15:01,575 --> 00:15:03,200
[banging]

217
00:15:03,325 --> 00:15:05,200
Oh, hell no. No, no, no.

218
00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:07,366
Go, go. Desi, go!

219
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:08,866
- What? That's your...
- Go!

220
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,700
- That's your fucking mother right there.
- Go!

221
00:15:11,575 --> 00:15:13,033
[Jackie] Oh, God.

222
00:15:16,741 --> 00:15:18,366
[woman laughing]

223
00:15:18,491 --> 00:15:20,700
If it ain't Muhammad Ali.

224
00:15:20,825 --> 00:15:22,533
[Jackie] What you doing here?

225
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:26,241
Haven't heard from her in years
and that's our welcome.

226
00:15:26,366 --> 00:15:28,866
Well, I got a nice
surprise for you.

227
00:15:28,991 --> 00:15:31,866
That little motherfucker
over there? Over there...

228
00:15:31,991 --> 00:15:33,616
That's your son.

229
00:15:33,741 --> 00:15:36,991
That baby,
the one you dumped on his dad?

230
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:39,033
Yeah, well his daddy died.

231
00:15:39,158 --> 00:15:42,700
Guess who got a knock on her door,
saying, "Meet your grandson"?

232
00:15:42,825 --> 00:15:44,325
Who fucking brought him?

233
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,200
The so-called girlfriend.
Some young Cuban chick.

234
00:15:47,325 --> 00:15:50,033
Flew him up from Miami
and brought his ass to me

235
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,575
'cause she don't
have no address.

236
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,616
- [Desi] What do you mean the father died?
- Bullet to the head.

237
00:15:55,741 --> 00:15:59,991
She told me Manny Sr. worked
undercover and he got got.

238
00:16:00,116 --> 00:16:03,491
Little Manny here witnessed it,
but he ain't talkin'.

239
00:16:03,616 --> 00:16:05,325
What the fuck's that mean,
he ain't talking?

240
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,408
Not talking.
As in the motherfucker don't talk.

241
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:11,325
Some trauma, she called it.
I don't know. The kid don't say boo.

242
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,033
[Desi] You gonna take
that little fucker with you.

243
00:16:13,158 --> 00:16:14,533
Are you deaf or stupid?

244
00:16:14,658 --> 00:16:17,283
Look. I would.
But I'm runnin' a business at my place.

245
00:16:17,408 --> 00:16:19,033
And my health's no good. Shit.

246
00:16:19,158 --> 00:16:21,533
Give me a fucking break.
You ain't got a fucking health problem.

247
00:16:21,658 --> 00:16:23,950
Jackie says all you ever do
is pop pills and sell wigs.

248
00:16:24,075 --> 00:16:26,533
Okay. You comin'
for the wrong one.

249
00:16:26,658 --> 00:16:27,783
[scoffs] Fuck that.

250
00:16:27,908 --> 00:16:30,825
Look, this ain't my mess.
This is your mess.

251
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,700
For once in your life, girl,
handle your business.

252
00:16:35,366 --> 00:16:37,408
Uh-huh. [clicks tongue]

253
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:40,533
- What's this bitch sayin' now?
- Jackie, get this boy some towels.

254
00:16:41,741 --> 00:16:44,366
[woman] Come on, baby.
Right here. Arms up.

255
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,491
Where's the towel?

256
00:16:47,283 --> 00:16:49,575
Bitch, you ain't gonna do shit?
Okay.

257
00:16:50,366 --> 00:16:54,116
Standing like a statue.
Where's the damn bathroom?

258
00:16:59,658 --> 00:17:00,616
Here.

259
00:17:01,408 --> 00:17:04,075
Y'all are just triflin',
both of you. Just triflin'.

260
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,283
Okay.

261
00:17:07,366 --> 00:17:09,866
Here's my address
and phone number.

262
00:17:10,616 --> 00:17:12,783
All right? Don't go
blowing your nose on it.

263
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:15,658
Okay. All right.

264
00:17:16,658 --> 00:17:18,033
Hey, Angel. Hey... hey.

265
00:17:18,866 --> 00:17:22,866
Jackie can't take on a kid.
Look at her. She's a fucking fighter.

266
00:17:22,991 --> 00:17:24,533
One hell of a fighter.

267
00:17:25,658 --> 00:17:27,450
That look like
a big-ass winner to you?

268
00:17:29,283 --> 00:17:30,075
[woman scoffs]

269
00:17:34,825 --> 00:17:37,033
- This is, uh... quite a turn of events.
- [door closes]

270
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:38,950
I mean, Jacqueline, I...

271
00:17:42,366 --> 00:17:44,200
Hey, where you...
where you going?

272
00:17:45,491 --> 00:17:46,575
What are you doing?

273
00:17:52,783 --> 00:17:55,616
[thunder rumbles]

274
00:18:02,408 --> 00:18:05,700
[oppressive music playing]

275
00:18:08,991 --> 00:18:09,700
[inhales deeply]

276
00:18:15,283 --> 00:18:17,116
[breathing heavily]

277
00:18:32,241 --> 00:18:33,575
[music stops]

278
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:49,283

279
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:10,950
[sighs]

280
00:20:16,908 --> 00:20:18,700
[brakes squeaking
in the distance]

281
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:28,825
I mean, he's gotta have some cousins,
another fucking grandma or something.

282
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:31,033
No, we ain't keeping that kid.

283
00:20:37,325 --> 00:20:38,658
Hey, you want some breakfast?

284
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:41,533
Come on.

285
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,616
Come on, take a seat.

286
00:20:45,908 --> 00:20:50,116
Shit. Come on, chacho. It's all right.
It's all right. Come on in there.

287
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:54,325
What, you wanna eat or not?
It's okay.

288
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,783
[chuckles] Ain't gonna bite you
or anything.

289
00:20:56,908 --> 00:20:59,408
Go on in there.
Take a seat. It's cool.

290
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,575
Come on, Jack, make him
a burger or something.

291
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:05,491
It's food.
Come on, just make him a burger.

292
00:21:15,616 --> 00:21:17,408
We ran out of buns.

293
00:21:17,533 --> 00:21:20,075
But I'm gonna show you
how to eat a burger. Hey, Jack.

294
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,366
Get me the chips from the top
of the fridge over there.

295
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,158
You're gonna like this shit.

296
00:21:28,116 --> 00:21:30,825
Yeah, I'm gonna show you
how a real man eats his burger.

297
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:34,491
Crush them like that, real fine.
See that? Huh?

298
00:21:35,408 --> 00:21:37,283
That's how a grown man eats.

299
00:21:38,575 --> 00:21:41,575
Oh, no, no. She just, uh,
she just fell down a flight of stairs.

300
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:44,325
Normally, she ain't that ugly.

301
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,866
[sets bottle on table]

302
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:49,908
Here you go.

306
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:31,700
You, uh, looking

307
00:23:33,575 --> 00:23:34,533
Yeah.

308
00:23:34,658 --> 00:23:37,116
All the way in the back.
Supply room.

309
00:23:44,616 --> 00:23:45,325
[whispers] Hey.

310
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:47,533
You know who that is?

311
00:23:49,575 --> 00:23:50,866
You ought to.

312
00:23:54,491 --> 00:23:56,991

Om mani padme hum.
Om mani padme hum.

316
00:24:12,825 --> 00:24:14,241
[Jackie] Uh, excuse me.

317
00:24:15,366 --> 00:24:16,950
I'm looking for Buddhakan.

318
00:24:17,991 --> 00:24:19,033
Is that you?

319
00:24:20,533 --> 00:24:21,450
Wait.

320
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:27,658
Om mani padme hum.

321
00:24:27,783 --> 00:24:33,533
Om mani padme hum.
Om mani padme hum.

322
00:24:36,366 --> 00:24:39,033
[chanting continues]

323
00:24:45,658 --> 00:24:46,700
[chanting stops]

324
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:53,450
[sighs]

325
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,991
Oof!

326
00:25:04,783 --> 00:25:06,200
Immaculate sent you?

327
00:25:06,325 --> 00:25:07,033
Yeah.

328
00:25:10,616 --> 00:25:13,075
You used to be
Jackie Justice, right?

329
00:25:13,825 --> 00:25:15,950
- Still am.
- Oh, yeah?

330
00:25:17,408 --> 00:25:18,283
We'll see.

331
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,533
Well, you had
your 15 minutes of fame.

332
00:25:25,575 --> 00:25:26,533
Why are you here?

333
00:25:31,491 --> 00:25:33,116
[uplifting music playing]

334
00:25:36,783 --> 00:25:37,741
[Jackie grunts]

335

336
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:51,700
You giving up already?
Come on. A hundred more.

[whimpers]

340
00:26:08,783 --> 00:26:10,991
No tears. And do 25 more.

341
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:16,658
Ugh.

342
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:20,283
You're not sprinting.

517
00:38:16,241 --> 00:38:17,075
Manny!

[kids chuckling]

520
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,200
Oh, y'all think that's funny?

521
00:38:42,658 --> 00:38:44,700
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
This ain't never gonna happen again.

522
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:45,700
Stop.

523
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,200
Immaculate's here.

524
00:38:48,325 --> 00:38:49,950
Now, go get geared up.

525
00:38:51,825 --> 00:38:54,908
I'll bring little man in for a while.
And make sure he gets home safe.

526
00:39:04,783 --> 00:39:05,575
Young man.

527
00:39:06,866 --> 00:39:09,866
My name is Buddhakan
and you're gonna come with me.

528
00:39:13,325 --> 00:39:14,741
[man] Yeah, hands off. Let's go!

529
00:39:22,616 --> 00:39:24,116
What's that you got there?

530
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:38,283
- [Jackie grunts]
- There you go!

531
00:39:38,908 --> 00:39:39,866
Yeah.

532
00:39:41,033 --> 00:39:41,783
Go!

533
00:39:42,783 --> 00:39:44,158
[Immaculate]
Knock her ass out, boy.

534
00:39:45,283 --> 00:39:47,700
Come on, Justice.
Come on. Get strong.

535
00:39:48,533 --> 00:39:49,866
Hit, hit. Come on, right there.

536
00:39:49,991 --> 00:39:51,075
[Jackie] Ah!

537
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:51,991
[crash from the ring]

538
00:39:59,116 --> 00:40:00,991
[groaning]

539
00:40:07,616 --> 00:40:09,366
[Immaculate] All right, come on.
Come on. Get it, get it, get it.

540

[chuckles]

541
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:13,075
Come on! [claps]

542
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,075
Your mum is a good fighter.

543
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,950
[Immaculate] Come on. Boom!
There you go!

544
00:40:18,075 --> 00:40:20,158
Kick him again. Come on.
Kick him. Boom!

545
00:40:20,283 --> 00:40:22,241
[Buddhakan] You didn't know
she fought, did you?

546
00:40:23,325 --> 00:40:24,533
[Immaculate] Keep that guard up.

547
00:40:24,658 --> 00:40:27,741
I think she's pretty cool.
What do you think?

548
00:40:27,866 --> 00:40:28,741
[Immaculate] Nice.

549
00:40:30,991 --> 00:40:32,491
[Buddhakan] I can teach you
some cool stuff, too.

550
00:40:32,616 --> 00:40:34,366
[Immaculate] Boom!

551
00:40:34,491 --> 00:40:38,491
- Like how to have special powers.
- [Immaculate] Move! Keep moving!

552
00:40:38,616 --> 00:40:39,658
Would you like that?

553
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,116
[Immaculate]
You soft, man! You soft!

554
00:40:45,241 --> 00:40:46,033
Okay.

555
00:40:47,325 --> 00:40:50,283
How about we go to the park?

556
00:40:50,408 --> 00:40:51,533
[Immaculate] There you go!

557
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:53,366
You like the park, don't you?

558
00:40:53,491 --> 00:40:54,825
[Immaculate] Boom! Ah!

559
00:40:55,783 --> 00:40:57,116
Get him, Justice! Go!

[chanting]
Om tare tuttare ture swaha.

561
00:41:01,283 --> 00:41:08,075
Om tare tuttare ture swaha.
Om tare tuttare ture swaha.

562
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:13,325

Feels good, don't it?

565
00:41:27,825 --> 00:41:32,200
So now, if you need a place
to go that's all on your own

566
00:41:32,325 --> 00:41:33,658
you can chant a little.

567
00:41:35,241 --> 00:41:36,283
One more thing.

568
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:44,575
If you ever get scared just
raise your arms up all the way.

569
00:41:47,741 --> 00:41:49,075
And breathe.

570
00:41:51,783 --> 00:41:53,283
[seagulls cry]

571
00:41:58,658 --> 00:42:00,200
[Immaculate] I did 15 years

572
00:42:00,325 --> 00:42:03,783
for second-degree murder
when I was 16 years old

573
00:42:03,908 --> 00:42:06,408
and that was just for the body
they caught me on.

574
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,491
Yeah, you know I was affiliated.

575
00:42:11,283 --> 00:42:13,283
So they was right to put me away.
You feel me?

576
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:19,908
But you? You was in Spofford
as a juvenile, right?

577
00:42:21,241 --> 00:42:23,366
- Yep.
- Yeah.

578
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:29,075
You know, when I got out,
a man gave me a second chance, Jackie.

579
00:42:29,991 --> 00:42:32,366
A few years later.
I'm sitting here with you.

580
00:42:33,991 --> 00:42:35,450
Offering you a chance.

581
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:41,450
To fight for the flyweight
championship belt

582
00:42:42,283 --> 00:42:46,783
against Lady Killer
on January 24th.

583
00:42:50,491 --> 00:42:51,741
A title fight?

584
00:42:51,866 --> 00:42:55,908
Ten K, just to show up.
Twenty K if you win.

585
00:42:56,783 --> 00:43:00,200
It's gonna be televised.
Nationally.

586
00:43:01,991 --> 00:43:05,366
Listen, a lot of people, man,
they saw what you did in the UFC.

587
00:43:06,491 --> 00:43:10,866
[chuckles]
Hey, you was bad bitch then.

588
00:43:10,991 --> 00:43:12,408
Damn!

589
00:43:13,408 --> 00:43:15,825
But that was, what,
four years ago or some shit?

590
00:43:16,825 --> 00:43:17,700
Yeah.

591
00:43:19,241 --> 00:43:22,783
Well, now...
this is your shot, Jackie.

592
00:43:22,908 --> 00:43:26,575
This is your shot
to show the UFC,

593
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:31,366
to show all of them the real
Jackie Justice, you feel me?

594
00:43:34,616 --> 00:43:36,075
You gonna take it?

595
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,866
- A title fight?
- Mm-hm.

596
00:43:41,116 --> 00:43:42,200
Yeah, I'm gonna take it.

597
00:43:42,325 --> 00:43:43,616
Come on. Say it with your chest.

598
00:43:43,741 --> 00:43:44,533
Yeah.

599
00:43:45,366 --> 00:43:47,325
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

600
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:49,825
- You have to call my manager, though.
- Ah. [sighs]

601
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:53,116
- Desi DeMarco.
- No, no, no, no. Listen.

602
00:43:53,241 --> 00:43:56,700
If I sign you, it's going to be exclusive.
It can't be no other way. Okay?

603
00:43:56,825 --> 00:43:59,658
- No, no. He's more than my manager.
- You want Desi or a title fight?

604
00:43:59,783 --> 00:44:01,033
Listen, I get it.
He's your boyfriend.

605
00:44:01,158 --> 00:44:02,741
Just let him be that
for you then.

606
00:44:02,866 --> 00:44:05,200
No, look. He dropped
all his fighters for me.

607
00:44:05,325 --> 00:44:06,491
- Jackie, Jackie.
- Okay? Listen...

608
00:44:06,616 --> 00:44:08,866
Jackie! Come on, Jackie,
stop this, okay?

609
00:44:08,991 --> 00:44:11,533
You were ten-and-oh.
On track for a title fight.

610
00:44:11,658 --> 00:44:14,408
Then your mans got desperate
and threw you in a match

611
00:44:14,533 --> 00:44:16,991
you weren't even close to being
ready for and you became a joke.

612
00:44:17,116 --> 00:44:19,366
Yeah, you, Jackie.

613
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:22,575
- You.
- [distorted voices, gasping]

614
00:44:30,575 --> 00:44:31,700
Look, I get it.

615
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:36,408
To his face, I'll always be
respectful, that I promise you.

616
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,241
But your man's incompetent,
Jackie.

617
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:42,700
And this is why
he has no other fighters.

618
00:44:43,533 --> 00:44:46,283
And everyone knows it.
I'm sorry, but that's the truth.

619
00:44:49,283 --> 00:44:52,325
I bet you haven't slept good
in the past four years, huh?

620
00:44:56,575 --> 00:44:57,325
I know.

621
00:45:00,325 --> 00:45:03,783
So maybe this is your shot for you
to lay your head down at night...

with dignity again.

624
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,116
Dignity, Jackie.

625
00:45:16,158 --> 00:45:17,908
And maybe a championship belt.

626
00:45:28,658 --> 00:45:30,033
Who the hell are you?

627
00:45:30,158 --> 00:45:33,783
Okay. Well, you must be Desi.
I'm Jackie's lead trainer.

You're the Buddhakan?

00:45:37,241 --> 00:45:39,241
- [Buddhakan] Look. I'm just helping her with Manny.
- Mm.

630
00:45:39,366 --> 00:45:40,991
She had to talk to Immaculate.

631
00:45:41,783 --> 00:45:43,116
He... he came to see her?

632
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:47,283
That asshole not realize
I'm her fucking manager?

633
00:45:47,408 --> 00:45:48,866
- Look...
- I'm her fucking manager.

634
00:45:48,991 --> 00:45:50,325
I'll check on you later.

635
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:52,575

- Okay, little man?

[Desi]
Start tellin' me somethin'.

685
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:09,866
From the beginning,
I've been tellin' you,

686
00:48:09,991 --> 00:48:11,991
communicate with me,
don't just do your own thing!

687
00:48:12,116 --> 00:48:14,200
[Jackie] I don't, 'cause when something
good happens to me, you piss on it.

688
00:48:14,325 --> 00:48:16,366
- [drumbeat playing]
- [Desi] What are you talking about?

689
00:48:16,491 --> 00:48:18,158
Things good happen to you
all the time with me.

690
00:48:18,283 --> 00:48:19,950
[Jackie] What?

691
00:48:20,075 --> 00:48:22,491
[Desi] The whole time you were with
me, good things were happening.

692
00:48:22,616 --> 00:48:25,075
[Jackie] Nothing was good for me.
I was getting no fights. Nothing good.

693
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,658
[playing notes on keyboard]

694
00:48:26,783 --> 00:48:28,241
[Desi] I need to talk
to that promoter.

695
00:48:28,366 --> 00:48:30,366
[Jackie] Then call him,
you're my manager.

696
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:32,866
[Desi] You listening
to this bitch, Buddhakan...

697
00:48:32,991 --> 00:48:34,158
[Jackie] Why's she gotta
be a bitch?

698
00:48:34,283 --> 00:48:36,533
I'm tired of you talking
about women like that!

699
00:48:36,658 --> 00:48:38,283
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- [alarm beeping]

700
00:48:38,408 --> 00:48:41,158
[Jackie] You, your mother, father
and everybody in your goddamn family.

701
00:48:41,283 --> 00:48:44,533
[Desi] Okay, I had to leave.
And then you go involving them.

702
00:48:44,658 --> 00:48:46,866
[Jackie] It's everything
your way. It's always gotta be...

703
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,116
[alarm beeping]

704
00:48:49,908 --> 00:48:52,200
- What the fuck?
- Oh, shit!

705
00:48:52,325 --> 00:48:53,950
Ah! Fucking...! Mother...

706
00:48:54,533 --> 00:48:57,825
Shit! Oh, goddamn it!

707
00:48:59,241 --> 00:49:00,325
Fuck!

708
00:49:03,658 --> 00:49:04,825
[alarm stops beeping]

709
00:49:06,116 --> 00:49:07,283
Ugh.

710
00:49:07,408 --> 00:49:09,075
Goddamn it!

711
00:49:11,783 --> 00:49:13,408
- Fuck.
- You fucking...

712
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:14,658
Hey!

713
00:49:16,033 --> 00:49:17,658
He cleans this up! All right?

714
00:49:27,783 --> 00:49:28,866
[door slams shut]

715
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:36,408
Look at me, Manny.
I'm not gonna let that man hurt you.

716
00:49:36,533 --> 00:49:39,325
Okay? I'm Big and you're Little.

717
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:41,991
And Big protects Little.

718
00:49:42,783 --> 00:49:43,533
Okay?

719
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:46,533
You hear me?

720
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:51,991
Okay, now that keyboard
in there, that's just for you.

721
00:49:53,158 --> 00:49:56,908
You go in there, you play with that,
and I'mma clean up all this mess, okay?

722
00:50:00,075 --> 00:50:01,241
Go ahead.

723
00:50:08,033 --> 00:50:10,700
["Hallelujah"
instrumental playing]

724
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:59,866
["Hallelujah"
instrumental continues]

725
00:51:05,366 --> 00:51:07,200
[panting]

726
00:51:23,408 --> 00:51:27,533
[man] Ooh, look at that there!
He fucked up!

727
00:51:28,491 --> 00:51:30,283
What happened my friend?

728
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:32,450
Yo, what's poppin', bro?

729
00:51:32,575 --> 00:51:35,283
- What's happening?
- Oh, you know. Fuckin' day.

730
00:51:35,408 --> 00:51:38,325
- How you doin'?
- He fucked up. Somebody fucked up.

731
00:51:38,450 --> 00:51:41,450
- He wanna go home, yo!
- Here. It's for you.

732
00:51:41,575 --> 00:51:44,116
- For you, Pinky.
- Yeah, these for me? [laughing]

733
00:51:45,908 --> 00:51:47,741
["Hallelujah"
instrumental continues]

734
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:52,366
[door bangs]

735
00:51:52,491 --> 00:51:53,408
Shit.

736
00:52:18,408 --> 00:52:19,491
[music stops]

737
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:57,658
Okay. So I'mma be back here at
three, pick you up, okay?

738
00:52:57,783 --> 00:53:00,825
- [bell rings]
- It's gonna be good, you'll see.

739
00:53:02,616 --> 00:53:03,366
Here...

740
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:07,158
Here you go.

741
00:53:08,241 --> 00:53:09,325
It's lunch money.

742
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:16,658
Okay. Go on.

743
00:53:41,783 --> 00:53:43,325
Hang on. Stop. Stop. Stop.

744
00:53:46,241 --> 00:53:48,200
[panting]

745
00:53:50,158 --> 00:53:52,075
Come on. I'll be you.

746
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:02,200
Hands on her hips.
Walk your feet in.

747
00:54:02,325 --> 00:54:05,200
Push up into your bridge first,
then extend your arms

748
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:06,866
then get your legs free, okay?

749
00:54:06,991 --> 00:54:08,241
Okay.

750
00:54:09,991 --> 00:54:13,616
Yeah? Push forward, then from
here you can do whatever you want.

751
00:54:14,908 --> 00:54:16,241
[strains] Huh!

752
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,450
- Fuck. Okay.
- You got it?

753
00:54:19,575 --> 00:54:21,783
It's looking good, though.
Really good.

754
00:54:21,908 --> 00:54:24,366
Lady Killer? She a beast, man.

755
00:54:24,491 --> 00:54:27,950
I don't know if I can take her.
She the real deal.

756
00:54:28,075 --> 00:54:29,741
We just gotta study some
of her footage.

757
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:33,200
Your real power is in grappling.

758
00:54:33,325 --> 00:54:35,950
If you can get her to the
ground, you're in with a chance.

759
00:54:37,158 --> 00:54:40,116
Question is, what are you
gonna do if she stays standing?

760
00:54:40,241 --> 00:54:41,700
Yeah, that's a good question.

761
00:54:43,616 --> 00:54:45,075
I'll tell you what.

762
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,950
I'll come over later and
we'll watch some videos, yeah?

763
00:54:48,991 --> 00:54:49,908
Okay.

764
00:54:53,116 --> 00:54:54,033
You know, Jack.

765
00:54:55,741 --> 00:54:59,075
You could have taken that girl that
night, if you'd stayed with it.

766
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,116
I mean brutal,
brutal first round.

767
00:55:03,866 --> 00:55:05,408
But you could have taken her.

768
00:55:14,158 --> 00:55:16,866
Oh, what's up with little man?
He start school?

769
00:55:19,158 --> 00:55:20,991
Oh, shit. What time is it?

770
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:27,366
Yeah, he in school.
Come by later! I'll be there!

771
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,866
Hey, you can get one candy.

772
00:55:32,741 --> 00:55:34,116
Okay? One.

773
00:55:43,116 --> 00:55:44,408
There you go.

774
00:55:52,866 --> 00:55:55,783
Okay, hold up. I said you could get one.
That's three.

775
00:55:56,616 --> 00:55:58,408
You gotta take
two of those back.

776
00:56:00,991 --> 00:56:02,283
No, no. Hey, hey, hey.

777
00:56:03,616 --> 00:56:05,200
You gotta take two back.

778
00:56:11,825 --> 00:56:13,325
Total's 23.90.

779
00:56:17,491 --> 00:56:18,491
I got twenty.

780
00:56:36,783 --> 00:56:38,325
[coins rattling]

781
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:53,283
Come on. Hook on.

782
00:56:59,366 --> 00:57:01,366
[sizzling, explosion]

783
00:57:01,491 --> 00:57:03,075
[dramatic music playing]

784
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,991
[man]
She is your worst nightmare.

785
00:57:06,116 --> 00:57:09,241
[announcer]
The winner by knockout,

786
00:57:09,366 --> 00:57:12,866
flyweight champion of the world

787
00:57:12,991 --> 00:57:19,533
Lucia "Lady Killer" Chavez!

788
00:57:23,366 --> 00:57:25,158
- Okay. See it?
- Yeah.

789
00:57:28,658 --> 00:57:31,783
- It's them kicks. She got those kicks.
- Mm.

790
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:34,616
Oh!

791
00:57:36,075 --> 00:57:37,075
Shit.

792
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:38,700
Hey.

793
00:57:38,825 --> 00:57:39,866
[Desi laughs]

794
00:57:39,991 --> 00:57:41,200
[slurring] Oh, shit.

795
00:57:42,533 --> 00:57:45,075
[chuckling] If it ain't
the fuckin' Buddhakan.

796
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,825
Fuck me, man. I'm tellin' you.

797
00:57:52,658 --> 00:57:54,908
I... I don't know why the
fuck I hide this shit no more.

798
00:57:55,033 --> 00:57:58,325
If I put it up my ass, she'd pull it out.
Right out.

799
00:58:03,116 --> 00:58:04,658
Oh, fuck.

800
00:58:04,783 --> 00:58:07,616
All right. This is getting
too fucking comical now.

801
00:58:07,741 --> 00:58:11,241
Hey, Jack. Hey.
You threw my shit out?

802
00:58:11,366 --> 00:58:14,200
You threw out my shit. This isn't
my fucking house anymore, or what?

803
00:58:14,325 --> 00:58:17,616
- You know what? I think you got to go.
- Hey, no, no. Hey, wait.

804
00:58:17,741 --> 00:58:20,283
Sit down. Sit down.
I'm gonna show you something right now.

805
00:58:20,908 --> 00:58:22,491
I got something to show you.

806
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,825
Hey, wait, now.
Sit down. Sit down.

807
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:27,450
I gotta show you this shit.
You see this? You see this?

808
00:58:27,575 --> 00:58:29,991
Alcohol.
She hides alcohol in this shit.

809
00:58:30,116 --> 00:58:33,366
Fuckin' scotch in cleaning bottles.
You smell it?

810
00:58:33,491 --> 00:58:36,491
Huh? And she thinks
I don't fuckin' know about it!

811
00:58:36,616 --> 00:58:38,325
She's stupid or something.

812
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:41,075
That's your fucking
prize fighter right there.

813
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:42,533
We'll watch it another time.

814
00:58:42,658 --> 00:58:44,658
- Yep.
- See you tomorrow.

815
00:58:44,783 --> 00:58:47,450
Ooh, angry Buddhakan.
Get the fuck outta here. Huh? Hey!

816
00:58:47,575 --> 00:58:50,200
[Desi] What the fuck's
the matter with you?

817
00:58:50,325 --> 00:58:52,908
What do you want me to do?
I'm walking into a fucking circus here.

818
00:58:53,033 --> 00:58:55,658
You're showin' your fucking
cartoons and shit? Come on.

819
00:58:55,783 --> 00:58:57,700
Remember what I taught you.

820
00:58:57,825 --> 00:58:59,491
- [Desi] Come on, sweetheart.
- [Jackie] Get off me.

821
00:58:59,616 --> 00:59:01,200
[Desi] Why are you
getting so serious?

822
00:59:01,325 --> 00:59:03,616
Ah, come on. It's just a fuckin' joke.
Just smi...

823
00:59:03,741 --> 00:59:06,033
Hey, now. Come on. Smile for me.

824
00:59:06,158 --> 00:59:08,158
- Desi, stop!
- Stop fuckin' pushin' me away.

825
00:59:08,283 --> 00:59:09,533
Why you doin' that?

826
00:59:09,658 --> 00:59:11,616
- [Desi] Come on, baby.
- [Jackie] Get off me.

827
00:59:11,741 --> 00:59:12,491
[Desi] Hey.

828
00:59:14,075 --> 00:59:17,158
You don't smell like you
right now. Hey, come on.

829
00:59:17,283 --> 00:59:19,533
Come on, baby.
Stop fucking pushing me away.

830
00:59:19,658 --> 00:59:21,658
I just wanna kiss you right now.

831
00:59:21,783 --> 00:59:23,741
- Hey, open your mouth.
- [keyboard drumbeat starts]

832
00:59:23,866 --> 00:59:25,450
- [Jackie shouts] No!
- I need to smell your fuckin' tongue.

833
00:59:25,575 --> 00:59:27,408
- Open your...
- Fuck you! No!

834
00:59:27,533 --> 00:59:30,491
Hey! Touch that shit one more time
and I'll throw it out and you with it!

835
00:59:30,616 --> 00:59:32,450
- Jesus Christ!
- This fucking kid.

836
00:59:32,575 --> 00:59:34,950
- [Manny plays keyboard loudly]
- Hey! That's it. Hey!

837
00:59:35,075 --> 00:59:37,908
Hey! What the fuck did I say?
Get the fuck outta there!

838
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:39,450
- Goddamn it!
- Wait, wait, wait. Hey!

839
00:59:39,575 --> 00:59:41,116
What the fuck is this doing
in the house anyway?

840
00:59:41,241 --> 00:59:42,908
[Jackie] No, no!

841
00:59:43,033 --> 00:59:45,491
Get out of my fuckin' way.
I'm gonna throw this shit outta the house.

842
00:59:45,616 --> 00:59:48,158
- No, don't take it!
- Get the fuck outta my way.

843
00:59:48,283 --> 00:59:49,200
No!

844
00:59:49,325 --> 00:59:50,783
- No!
- Stop! Get your hands...

845
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:52,825
Get away from me!

846
00:59:53,533 --> 00:59:55,241
- Piece of shit!
- [Jackie groans]

847
00:59:55,366 --> 00:59:57,783
- [Desi] Goddamnit!
- [Jackie groans]

848
00:59:57,908 --> 01:00:00,741
- [keyboard smashing]
- [Desi] Fuck! Fuck!

849
01:00:00,866 --> 01:00:02,491
- [keyboard clatters]
- [Jackie groans]

850
01:00:04,450 --> 01:00:05,366
What?

851
01:00:06,241 --> 01:00:07,575
[groans]

852
01:00:10,866 --> 01:00:11,783

01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:14,033
- Turn around!
- [referee] Fight!

1366
01:41:15,991 --> 01:41:18,825
[Jules] Oh!
Why wasn't she paying attention?

1367
01:41:22,950 --> 01:41:24,908
- Ah!
- [Jules] Oh, another big shot.

1368
01:41:25,033 --> 01:41:27,325
[Yves] Justice's gotta keep her hands up.
She's gotta move her head.

1369
01:41:28,325 --> 01:41:29,950
[Jules] Oh! Nice shot.

1370
01:41:30,950 --> 01:41:32,658
A malicious head kick.

1371
01:41:32,783 --> 01:41:34,033
A creative way
of getting out of it.

1372
01:41:34,158 --> 01:41:35,658
She might wanna
stay down there.

1373
01:41:35,783 --> 01:41:38,408
You can't get kicked in the head
when you're on the ground.

1374
01:41:41,575 --> 01:41:44,158
[Yves] Justice has gotta time one
of those kicks and set up her shot.

1375
01:41:44,283 --> 01:41:46,783
She's gotta get to the inside.
Southside is not working for her.

1376
01:41:48,866 --> 01:41:50,283
[cheering, applause]

1377
01:41:52,908 --> 01:41:58,533
[indistinct dialogue on TV]

1378
01:42:00,908 --> 01:42:04,033
[Jules] Oh, my God.
That body shot. Jeez.

1379
01:42:04,158 --> 01:42:06,575
[Yves] She's just starting
to pick Justice apart.

1380
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:07,491
[Jules] Oh, my goodness.

1381
01:42:09,700 --> 01:42:13,158
[Jules] She is unloading on her.
I love ending on a leg kick like that.

1382
01:42:14,783 --> 01:42:16,366
[Jules] Nice shot there
by Justice.

1383
01:42:16,491 --> 01:42:17,908
Shake it off. Shake it off.

1384
01:42:18,033 --> 01:42:19,033
[woman in crowd]
That's it, don't wait for it!

1385
01:42:20,616 --> 01:42:21,991
[Yves] Ooh!

1386
01:42:22,116 --> 01:42:23,533
[Jules] Nice front kick
to end the round.

1387
01:42:23,658 --> 01:42:24,825
- [hooter sounds]
- Time!

1388
01:42:27,075 --> 01:42:28,741
[Jules] Is she out on her feet?

1389
01:42:28,866 --> 01:42:31,408
It looked like she was.
Lady Killer almost had herself a victory.

1390
01:42:31,533 --> 01:42:34,866
[clears throat] What you doing?
I told you we not watching that.

1391
01:42:37,741 --> 01:42:39,158
Go to bed.

1392
01:42:39,283 --> 01:42:43,533
[indistinct TV dialogue]

1393
01:42:47,366 --> 01:42:50,950
She has a minute to recover.
Can she come back in the second round?

1394
01:42:51,075 --> 01:42:54,491
If she does, that tells me that she's been
in the trench and working on her game.

1395
01:42:54,616 --> 01:42:57,075
If this is the woman
that won ten fights in a row

1396
01:42:57,200 --> 01:42:59,491
that woman can do it.
The woman that jumped out of the cage?

1397
01:42:59,616 --> 01:43:00,450
I don't think so.

1398
01:43:03,450 --> 01:43:05,616
Listen to me, Jack.

1399
01:43:05,741 --> 01:43:08,075
You got to get it to the ground.
That's your home.

1400
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:11,116
You want to be here? Let me see
you look like you want to be here!

1401
01:43:11,783 --> 01:43:12,700
Let's go!

1402
01:43:15,450 --> 01:43:16,366
Good.

1403
01:43:17,616 --> 01:43:18,366
Ah!

1404
01:43:20,575 --> 01:43:22,450
[referee] Ma'am, are you ready?

1405
01:43:22,575 --> 01:43:24,325
Ma'am, are you ready? Fight.

1406
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:29,533
[Yves] If Justice is gonna last another
round, she's gotta change the game.

1407
01:43:29,658 --> 01:43:32,033
That was a dominant first round
by Lady Killer.

1408
01:43:32,158 --> 01:43:34,700
- [Jules] Takedown attempt!
- [Yves] That was a horrible shot.

1409
01:43:36,616 --> 01:43:38,950
Stand up. Stand up.

1410
01:43:40,533 --> 01:43:41,283
Fight.

1411
01:43:46,158 --> 01:43:48,158
[Yves] Lady Killer just likes
to pick apart the body,

1412
01:43:48,283 --> 01:43:49,991
get those hands down
and then take the head off.

1413
01:43:50,116 --> 01:43:52,366
- [Jules] Another double-leg attack!
- That was perfect timing.

1414
01:43:52,491 --> 01:43:53,783
To the ground!

1415
01:43:55,116 --> 01:43:58,575
[Yves] Justice's got the timing down.
Now can she control right here?

1416
01:43:59,783 --> 01:44:02,075
Beautiful side-control position.
Looking to get to the mount!

1417
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:04,116
- [Jules] She's there with the mount!
- [Yves] Full mount!

1418
01:44:06,325 --> 01:44:07,533
[Jackie grunting]

1419
01:44:07,658 --> 01:44:09,658
Get mad. Get mad. Get mad.

1420
01:44:10,241 --> 01:44:11,241
[Jackie yells]

1421
01:44:11,366 --> 01:44:13,075
[Yves] Beautiful
arm bar attempt.

1422
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:16,033
The champ's rolling,
trying to get that off and elbows out.

1423
01:44:16,158 --> 01:44:18,741
[Jules] She's free!
Big shots there from the champion.

1424
01:44:18,866 --> 01:44:19,700
[Yves] Beautiful up-kick!

1425
01:44:19,825 --> 01:44:21,616
Good! There you go.

1426
01:44:21,741 --> 01:44:23,158
[Yves] That really
hurt the champ.

1427
01:44:28,241 --> 01:44:30,116
[Yves] Great head movement
by Justice.

1428
01:44:30,241 --> 01:44:32,533
She's starting
to get the champ's timing down.

1429
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:35,866
Look at her work.
But she's getting tagged.

1430
01:44:37,616 --> 01:44:39,200
[Jules] She's just
teeing off on her now.

1431
01:44:40,075 --> 01:44:41,741
Oh! Big shot!

1432
01:44:41,866 --> 01:44:43,450
She pissed the champ off.
You can see that.

1433
01:44:43,575 --> 01:44:45,950
[Yves] That's not a woman
I want pissed off with me.

1434
01:44:50,116 --> 01:44:52,991
Payback is a dish
best served on your feet!

1435
01:44:53,116 --> 01:44:55,408
[Jules] These leg kicks
are doing some serious damage.

1436
01:44:56,491 --> 01:44:58,116
Time!

1437
01:44:58,241 --> 01:45:01,116
[Yves] Justice is gonna have a
hard time sitting on that stool.

1438
01:45:01,241 --> 01:45:03,575
For those of you thinking
leg kicks don't win fights,

1439
01:45:03,700 --> 01:45:05,866
you've never been leg-kicked.

1440
01:45:05,991 --> 01:45:07,866
- Manny, shut the door!
- [Jules] Jackie needs to step it up.

1441
01:45:07,991 --> 01:45:10,283
- Shut the door!
- [Jules] It's out there...

1442
01:45:11,533 --> 01:45:13,366
[cheering, whistling]

1443
01:45:16,950 --> 01:45:17,991
[speaks Spanish]

1444
01:45:19,241 --> 01:45:20,825
[in English]
Why she's not out yet?

1445
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:27,700
Listen to me. Look at me, Jack.

1446
01:45:28,866 --> 01:45:31,783
Gotta get her to the ground.
That's your home. You feel me?

1447
01:45:31,908 --> 01:45:34,325
You want to fight?
You want to be here?

1448
01:45:34,450 --> 01:45:36,283
Let me see you look
like you wanna be here.

1449
01:45:40,366 --> 01:45:41,283
Let's go!

1450
01:45:45,991 --> 01:45:49,616
[Jules] After those leg kicks,
let's see what Jackie's got left in her.

1451
01:45:51,408 --> 01:45:54,866
Lady Killer's doing the same thing.
Getting back to what got her to...

1452
01:45:54,991 --> 01:45:58,325
Oh! Catch of the kick!
Nicely done there by Jackie.

1453
01:45:58,450 --> 01:46:01,283
[Yves] This is what Justice needs to do,
she needs to control these top positions.

1454
01:46:02,616 --> 01:46:04,491
[Jules] Back up on the fence!
Lady Kill...

1455
01:46:04,616 --> 01:46:06,950
Oh! She's got Lady Killer
down again into side-control.

1456
01:46:07,075 --> 01:46:08,741
Hold her down. Hold her down.

1457
01:46:08,866 --> 01:46:10,908
[Yves] She's hit some beautiful
takedowns, but she's gotta cover.

1458
01:46:11,033 --> 01:46:13,450
- [referee] Watch the head.
- [Yves] She has to score with these takedowns.

1459
01:46:13,575 --> 01:46:15,991
[Jules] Nice ground and pound,
but she should've held onto that.

1460
01:46:17,408 --> 01:46:18,283
[Jackie] Oof!

1461
01:46:19,408 --> 01:46:20,616
Good escape by Justice there.

1462
01:46:25,658 --> 01:46:26,783
[Jules] Big swing and a miss!

1463
01:46:26,908 --> 01:46:27,991
To the ground! To the ground!

1464
01:46:29,116 --> 01:46:31,450
[Jules] Justice is trying
for that double-leg again!

1465
01:46:31,575 --> 01:46:33,491
[Yves] Wait a minute! Wait.
Beautiful tackle!

1466
01:46:33,616 --> 01:46:36,700
- Hold her down.
- [Yves] Nice reversal by Justice.

1467
01:46:36,825 --> 01:46:39,325
- Yves, this is getting exciting.
- Looking for an arm bar.

1468
01:46:42,075 --> 01:46:43,908
This is the Jiu-Jitsu
I was talking about.

1469
01:46:44,033 --> 01:46:47,116
She's got to get her hooks in
to sink that in properly.

1470
01:46:47,241 --> 01:46:49,866
She's almost there in the rear naked.
Oh, my goodness.

1471
01:46:59,241 --> 01:47:01,200
[Jules] Oh! Oh!
Back up on the fence!

1472
01:47:02,575 --> 01:47:05,950
Big knee to Justice.
Lady Killer is still in this.

1473
01:47:07,325 --> 01:47:08,950
Turn her into the fence.

1474
01:47:09,075 --> 01:47:11,825
- [Yves] Look at Justice, making the turn...
- Good! Good! There you go!

1475
01:47:11,950 --> 01:47:13,033
[Immaculate yells]

1476
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:22,158
[Yves] She may be beaten.
She's not done.

1477
01:47:22,283 --> 01:47:24,116
[Jules] Another double-leg
from Justice!

1478
01:47:24,241 --> 01:47:25,700
[sniggers]

1479
01:47:25,825 --> 01:47:27,700
You got her. You got her, Jack.

1480
01:47:27,825 --> 01:47:30,408
[Jules] A big ground and pound
from the contender.

1481
01:47:30,533 --> 01:47:34,241
[Yves] Big punches from the top.
And Justice is now pouring it on.

1482
01:47:34,366 --> 01:47:37,658
She hops on the back! Standing!
This rear naked is in!

1483
01:47:37,783 --> 01:47:39,241
You got it. You got it.

1484
01:47:39,366 --> 01:47:41,491
- She has it!
- [Jules] Her hooks are in!

1485
01:47:41,616 --> 01:47:43,325
- That choke is in. It's tight!
- This could be it!

1486
01:47:55,783 --> 01:47:57,075
[panting]

1487
01:47:58,158 --> 01:47:58,950
[hooter sounds]

1488
01:47:59,075 --> 01:48:00,075
Time!

1489
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:02,158
[Yves] Oh, saved by the bell!

1490
01:48:02,866 --> 01:48:03,783
Damn!

1491
01:48:06,700 --> 01:48:09,908
[applause, whistling]

1492
01:48:10,033 --> 01:48:12,033
[Yves] If Justice had
just ten more seconds

1493
01:48:12,158 --> 01:48:14,825
I believe we would be looking at
a new Invicta champion right now.

1494
01:48:14,950 --> 01:48:15,908
[Jules] This is insane.

1495
01:48:16,033 --> 01:48:19,491
Sit. Look at me.
Breathe. Look at me.

1496
01:48:23,366 --> 01:48:25,491
Breathe. You almost had her.

1497
01:48:25,616 --> 01:48:27,991
Now keep her on the ground,
that's where you're strong.

1498
01:48:29,783 --> 01:48:31,241
- You got it?
- Yeah!

1499
01:48:31,366 --> 01:48:34,325
All right. Yeah. That's it!

1500
01:48:34,450 --> 01:48:36,658
Good. Let's go. Finish her!

1501
01:48:39,116 --> 01:48:41,116
[whistling]

1502
01:48:41,241 --> 01:48:42,991
[referee] Fight!

1503
01:48:43,116 --> 01:48:45,491
[Yves] Championship rounds for Chavez.
She's never been here before.

1504
01:48:45,616 --> 01:48:47,741
Can she dig deep,
or is she gonna be too flustered?

1505
01:48:47,866 --> 01:48:51,241
[Jules] Big throw! For a champion
never having gone to this round,

1506
01:48:51,366 --> 01:48:53,450
she's doing pretty well.
She's mounted now.

1507
01:48:54,116 --> 01:48:55,241
[Pops] Reverse it!

1508
01:48:56,283 --> 01:48:57,408
[Yves] Not anymore!

1509
01:48:58,533 --> 01:49:01,408
Good reversal by Justice.
Justice is on top, working for a pass.

1510
01:49:01,533 --> 01:49:03,241
[Jules] This is where
Jackie shines.

1511
01:49:03,366 --> 01:49:06,116
She knows where to get those hooks.
She knows where to sink things in.

1512
01:49:06,241 --> 01:49:09,408
[Yves] Justice has got the timing down.
Now can she control right here?

1513
01:49:09,533 --> 01:49:11,116
Lock her! Lock her up!

1514
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:14,200
[Jules] Oh! Lady Killer out!

1515
01:49:14,325 --> 01:49:16,241
[Yves] Beautiful scramble here
by Lady Killer.

1516
01:49:16,366 --> 01:49:18,408
She got back
to that top position.

1517
01:49:21,033 --> 01:49:23,450
[Yves] Look at Justice. She's
working for a single from the bottom.

1518
01:49:23,575 --> 01:49:25,658
Lady Killer looks
for a knee bar, but no!

1519
01:49:25,783 --> 01:49:27,408
That scramble
was crazy beautiful!

1520
01:49:27,533 --> 01:49:30,575
What a sweep! She should've
done an omoplata right there.

1521
01:49:30,700 --> 01:49:32,075
Now they're back on their feet!

1522
01:49:33,533 --> 01:49:35,741
You can see
the champion's angry!

1523
01:49:36,950 --> 01:49:38,575
Another hook!

1524
01:49:38,700 --> 01:49:41,158
- [Jules] Just teeing off there now.
- [Yves] Champ's going to work.

1525
01:49:41,283 --> 01:49:44,366
See what happens when you
make the Lady Killer angry!

1526

- [Jules] Oh! Elbow!
- [Yves] Oh! And she's bleeding!

1527
01:49:47,866 --> 01:49:50,116
That cut can change
the rest of this fight.

1528
01:49:51,075 --> 01:49:52,616
- Nice duck.
- [Jules] She slips outside... Wow!

1529
01:49:52,741 --> 01:49:54,658
- Beautiful takedown!
- Big slam!

1530

[Jules] Look at her.
Contender's on top, landing punch...

1531
01:49:58,116 --> 01:49:59,408
Knee bar attempt!

1532
01:50:02,283 --> 01:50:04,950
[Yves] Wait. She's switching to
the heel hook! Inside heel hook!

1533
01:50:05,075 --> 01:50:06,033
That's nasty.

1534
01:50:06,950 --> 01:50:08,741

1535

- [Yves] Great round. Great fight.
- [Jules] Unbelievable!

1536
01:50:11,366 --> 01:50:13,366
[Yves] Can you believe what we're
seeing outta Jackie Justice?

1537
01:50:13,491 --> 01:50:15,200
This is a championship fight.

1538
01:50:15,325 --> 01:50:17,991
Four years out of the cage to come
back and bring this level to the table.

1539
01:50:18,116 --> 01:50:19,533
Yeah, yeah.

1540
01:50:19,658 --> 01:50:21,075
[Yves] I'm really impressed
with this woman tonight.

1541
01:50:23,075 --> 01:50:25,991
This is the final round.
You see what you can do?

1542
01:50:26,116 --> 01:50:28,950
Go out there
and light her ass up.

1543
01:50:30,658 --> 01:50:34,075
Yeah? Yeah, I see it. I see it.

1544

[growls]

1545
01:50:37,658 --> 01:50:39,241
Now this fight
is all about conditioning.

1546
01:50:39,366 --> 01:50:42,533
This is about who put in more work
in the gym and who wants it more.

1547
01:50:42,658 --> 01:50:45,283
Ma'am, are you ready?
Ma'am are you ready? Fight.

1548
01:50:53,866 --> 01:50:56,908
[Yves] Whoa! Lady Killer wants a takedown.
That's what she wants.

1549
01:50:57,033 --> 01:50:58,325
We didn't see this
earlier tonight.

1550
01:50:58,450 --> 01:51:00,116
She wanted
to keep this fight standing.

1551
01:51:04,116 --> 01:51:06,325
[Yves] She's looking for this triangle.
And that's deep.

1552
01:51:06,450 --> 01:51:08,075
Lady Killer's gotta
get her head up, butt down.

1553
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:09,616
Lock her up. Lock her up.

1554
01:51:10,575 --> 01:51:12,491
[Yves] She's got the legs up.

1555
01:51:12,616 --> 01:51:14,075
Get it all tight!

1556
01:51:15,075 --> 01:51:17,825
Justice may be the new champ if
she can just pull on that head!

1557
01:51:20,241 --> 01:51:21,950
Look. She's doing
what she needs to do!

1558
01:51:22,075 --> 01:51:23,616
[Jules] That posture!
Almost out.

1559
01:51:24,783 --> 01:51:26,200
Oh, nice!

1560
01:51:27,450 --> 01:51:30,325
[Yves] Beautiful defense.
She got herself outta that bad spot.

1561
01:51:30,450 --> 01:51:32,825
But how much does she have left
in the tank?

1562
01:51:32,950 --> 01:51:35,158
- That's the question.
- [Jules] She looks exhausted.

1563
01:51:41,366 --> 01:51:43,075
This is where heart shows.

1564
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:45,908
[Yves] This is high-level
MMA right here.

1565
01:51:46,033 --> 01:51:48,366
Fifth round, showing technique
showing heart.
