1
00:00:01,936 --> 00:00:04,003
           (silence)            

2
00:00:22,156 --> 00:00:27,159
        (wings flapping)        

3
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:35,467
   (thunder and pouring rain)   

4
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:39,972
            - Oh no.            

5
00:00:39,974 --> 00:00:41,340
            Oh fuck.            

6
00:00:41,342 --> 00:00:42,908
             Fuck!              

7
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,246
       Fuck, fuck, fuck,        
      fuck, fucking shit!       

8
00:00:47,248 --> 00:00:49,882
       (screams in agony)       

9
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:54,853
       (classical music)        

10
00:00:57,658 --> 00:00:59,291
- [Thomas] Relax druggie Dougie.

11
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:01,627
 - Don't fucking call me that.  

12
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:03,362
  My name is Doug, or Douglas.  

13
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:05,197
      I'm a fucking adult!      

14
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,500
    - I believe he's trying     
    to assert his authority.    

15
00:01:08,502 --> 00:01:11,503
      - Are you trying to       
     assert your authority?     

16
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:14,640
       - Maybe he thinks        
      he's in charge here.      

17
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:17,976
    - Do you think you're in    
  charge here, druggie Dougie?  

18
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:19,011
       - Don't fuckin'--        

19
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:20,646
        (fist slamming)         

20
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:25,117
       - What did I say?        

21
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,353
       - He said to relax       
        druggie Dougie.         

22
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:29,788
            (sighs)             

23
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,156
            - I did.            

24
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:33,425
        I said to relax.        

25
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:34,893
             Right?             

26
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:36,361
  - What do you want from me?   

27
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:40,132
   - We want to see how much    
     you love your new God?     

28
00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:43,502
       - Are you familiar       
        with yubitsume?         

29
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:48,574
- Yeah, it's that brown chicken 
   dish at fucking Benihana.    

30
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,512
    - No Doug, it's a ritual    
    practiced by the Yakuza.    

31
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:56,915
Yubitsume is a form of apology. 

32
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,618
   If a member of the Yakuza    
    were to dishonor himself    

33
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,288
   or one of his bosses he'd    
   be required to perform it.   

34
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:06,492
        - Perform what?         

35
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:09,828
  - He'd be asked to use this.  

36
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,096
         (eerie music)          

37
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:15,734
      - To cut the tip of       
     his pinky finger off.      

38
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:20,739
       (soft eerie music)       

39
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:24,710
     - Fuck, fuck you guys.     

40
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:27,713
  I'm not cutting the fucking   
     tip of my finger off!      

41
00:02:27,715 --> 00:02:30,816
       - Oh that's up to        
      you druggie Dougie.       

42
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:34,052
    - Yes, we're not the low    
    life drug addicts here.     

43
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:38,056
       - This stuff, this       
      means nothing to us.      

44
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:42,094
    - We just as soon flush     
      it down the toilet.       

45
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:43,962
          - We would.           

46
00:02:43,964 --> 00:02:47,332
        But we know you         
      wouldn't like that.       

47
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,469
       - You're what they       
      call a super addict.      

48
00:02:50,471 --> 00:02:52,471
     And besides we're only     
       asking for a pinky       

49
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:53,739
         you big baby.          

50
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:55,741
       - It's gonna hurt        
       like fucking shit!       

51
00:02:55,743 --> 00:02:56,808
             - Wow.             

52
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:02,047
It really only tickles a little.

53
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:05,017
     - And you'll have that     
       sweet, sweet crack       

54
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:07,553
     to take the edge off.      

55
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:09,955
      And then we'll drive      
       you to a hospital,       

56
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:13,825
       they'll patch you        
       up neat and tidy.        

57
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:18,430
        - This is, this         
       is fucking fucked.       

58
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:22,167
        - So is chemical        
  dependance, but here we are.  

59
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:25,437
      And you've certainly      
      dishonored yourself.      

60
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,808
     So I can't think of a      
   more apropos way to atone.   

61
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:36,615
     - Just the tip, right?     

62
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:38,417
         - That's all.          

63
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:41,853
        - So what do you        
      say druggie Dougie,       

64
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:45,891
       pinky or no pinky?       

65
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:48,360
       - And you fuckers        
      are going to take me      

66
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:49,595
     to the hospital right      
       afterwards, right?       

67
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:51,697
   - My golden word of honor.   

68
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:57,970
     - Let's up the ante a      
     little bit, shall we?      

69
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:04,943
   Odds are you've never seen   
   a kilo of cocaine before,    

70
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:08,180
      so feast your eyes.       

71
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:11,216
    - It's still yubitsume.     

72
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:12,918
            - But--             

73
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,823
    you do have to use this.    

74
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:20,158
            - Fuck.             

75
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,927
      Oh and how the fuck       
        am I supposed to        

76
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,129
cut my finger off with a rock!? 

77
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,465
        - Figure it out.        

78
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:30,602
      That's your problem       
        druggie Dougie.         

79
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,338
    - Or you can go for the     

80
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,208
     small package instead      

81
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,912
     and just use the knife     
      like a little bitch.      

82
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:46,218
        Shall we count?         

83
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:49,788
           - Fuck it!           

84
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,856
      - You got this Doug!      

85
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:53,158
       (screams in agony)       

86
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,559
        (wild screaming)        

87
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:55,327
          - It hurts!           

88
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:56,428
         - Go, go, go!          

89
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,095
      - It fucking hurts!       

90
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:58,330
           It hurts!            

91
00:04:58,332 --> 00:05:01,266
     - Just severe the bone     
      and you're all free!      

92
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:03,769
         Oh do it Doug!         

93
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:04,636
           One more!            

94
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:08,807
        (yelps in agony)        

95
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,942
             - Wow!             

96
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:12,911
           Oh my God!           

97
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:16,181
    Douglas, I am impressed.    

98
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,749
         Unbelievable.          

99
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,986
        You were right.         

100
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:24,356
     - See I told you, drug     
   addicts will do anything.    

101
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:25,791
            - Help!             

102
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:28,293
 - Well I am a man of my word,  
    you won fair and square.    

103
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:29,227
          - Thank you.          

104
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:33,265
       (heavy breathing)        

105
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:35,200
 - What the fuck is that about? 

106
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:38,670
  - Oh you see, I bet a dollar  
  that you would use the rock,  

107
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,273
      but Charles here, he      
     thought you'd puss out     

108
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:42,507
     and go for the knife.      

109
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,644
      - You bet on me you       
        yuppie assholes!        

110
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:48,246
       (amused chuckling)       

111
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:49,715
       What's so funny!?        

112
00:05:51,285 --> 00:05:53,452
        - It's powdered         
     sugar druggie Dougie.      

113
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:55,887
- And the packet was rock salt. 

114
00:05:55,889 --> 00:06:00,325
   (condescending chuckling)    

115
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:02,928
   - You fucking dick holes.    

116
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,129
           Fuck you.            

117
00:06:04,131 --> 00:06:07,032
      Just take me to the       
        hospital please.        

118
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:12,237
      - Now where are our       
      keys druggie Dougie?      

119
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,275
   - If they've been snakes--   

120
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:20,812
        - They would've         
       bitten me, I know.       

121
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,485
 - You can't walk away from me. 

122
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:32,324
     - Have to dash druggie     
     Dougie, it's been fun.     

123
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:35,527
      - Don't you fucking       
         leave me here!         

124
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:38,764
        Fucking help me!        

125
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:43,835
 (suspenseful electronic music) 

126
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:49,668
        (alarm ringing)         

127
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:04,583
           (knocking)           

128
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:07,285
   - Mother, are you decent?    

129
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:10,889
  - When am I ever not decent?  

130
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:21,032
    Are you trying to imply     
    I'm not a lady, Charlie?    

131
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,635
    - Of course not mother.     

132
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,670
       How did you sleep?       

133
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,305
          - Terribly.           

134
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:30,175
         Oh, if I could         
       move without pain,       

135
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,814
       I would've tossed        
     and turned all night.      

136
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:38,884
   - I'm sorry to hear that.    

137
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:45,156
You are still beautiful though. 

138
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,158
            - Yeah?             
             - Mhm.             

139
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,996
- Am I still your favorite girl?

140
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:53,198
      - Forever and ever.       

141
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,668
      - You sure got that       
        look sweetheart.        

142
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,170
      - Thank you mother.       

143
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:01,573
       - What time is it?       

144
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:06,645
      Oh, would you get my      
     medicine for me baby.      

145
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:09,748
    - I'd be glad to sweets.    

146
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,683
          - Thank you.          

147
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:15,754
       I had the weirdest       
       dream last night.        

148
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:17,222
        - You don't say.        

149
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:20,825
     - Yeah, I was standing     
   in the middle of the road    

150
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:23,995
     watching this horribly     
         disfigured man         

151
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:26,631
being pulled out of a car wreck.

152
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:28,400
           (chuckles)           

153
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:29,634
        And guess what?         

154
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:30,969
            - What?             

155
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:35,807
It started to rain rose petals. 

156
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,909
Isn't that the damnedest thing? 

157
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:41,279
     And to top it off the      
   police and the paramedics    

158
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:45,016
    around the wreck stopped    
      pulling the guy out       

159
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:51,356
   and started dancing around   
like it was a Broadway musical. 

160
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:53,091
          - Then what?          

161
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:57,395
    - Then my son called me     
   indecent and here we are.    

162
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:59,097
           - Oh hush.           

163
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:05,470
        Do you know what        
        Freud would say?        

164
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:09,874
   - Oh who gives two wooden    
 nickels what Freud would say.  

165
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:13,979
That's all psychobabble anyway. 

166
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:16,014
        - Probably true.        

167
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:20,151
     It's all just a series     
     of dreamed up notions.     

168
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:22,887
        - Barely 11 am,         

169
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:27,325
        and Freud is the        
      topic of discussion.      

170
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:28,927
        I'm missing out.        

171
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,629
    - Good morning, Thomas.     

172
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:33,298
     - Good morning mumsie.     

173
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,900
       - You two were out       
        late last night.        

174
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:39,771
       I hope you weren't       
   getting into any trouble.    

175
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:42,507
      - Not in the least.       

176
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:44,809
        - Is that true?         

177
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,412
       - Yes, of course.        

178
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,148
            - Good.             

179
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:52,684
           - Charles.           

180
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,319
        (keys jingling)         

181
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,421
           Breakfast.           

182
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,425
       - Have a good day.       

183
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:02,694
       - You too mother.        

184
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:08,233
             - Hmm.             

185
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:16,775
      (eerie quiet rumble)      

186
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:24,015
 - Is there anything in there?  

187
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,650
         - About what?          

188
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:27,752
      - About last night.       

189
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,822
    - Oh I'm sure our friend    
  Dougie either bled to death   

190
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:34,526
    in a gutter somewhere or    
     he patched himself up.     

191
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,829
      Also, do me a favor.      

192
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:39,998
   Never bring up Doug again.   

193
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,467
     Better for all of us.      

194
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,371
          - Of course.          

195
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,439
           I'm sorry.           

196
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:50,842
     - No, never be sorry.      

197
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:52,477
         You know that.         

198
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:56,181
       Sorry is a sign of       
       weakness Charles,        

199
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:58,550
     and that is one thing      
    we cannot afford to be.     

200
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,018
      - More coffee guys?       

201
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,320
           - Please.            
      - [Charles] Please.       

202
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:07,025
        (coffee pouring)        

203
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:10,628
- Genevieve, what a pretty name.

204
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,163
          - Thank you.          

205
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:15,266
    I actually pronounce it     
   Genevieve, sounds fancier.   

206
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:16,968
       - You're new here.       

207
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,738
      - Yeah, just started      
      yesterday actually.       

208
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,940
         - Well we're a         
      couple of regulars,       

209
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:24,809
       so we'll be seeing       
      lots of each other.       

210
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:27,479
          - Oh, great.          

211
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:29,914
     - I'm Thomas, and this     
      less handsome devil       

212
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:34,285
    with the pancake in his     
  mouth is my brother Charles.  

213
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:37,922
    - Oh, I'm sorry, hello.     

214
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:41,926
  - Hi, I'm Genevieve, again.   

215
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:44,362
            - Mommy.            

216
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:48,466
        - And that's my         
       daughter, Maddie.        

217
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:52,170
   Well you guys need a fill    
     up just give a shout.      

218
00:12:57,177 --> 00:13:01,880
     - Now that's a kind of     
  woman man was made to ruin.   

219
00:13:02,883 --> 00:13:04,048
           Genevieve.           

220
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,217
       (exhales in shock)       

221
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:08,253
       You look like you        
      could use a fill up.      

222
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:10,421
        (yelps in pain)         

223
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:11,956
           You could.           

224
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,725
    (intense dramatic music)    

225
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:18,797
       (heavy breathing)        

226
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:26,738
           - Thomas.            

227
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,007
            Thomas.             

228
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,509
            Thomas!             

229
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:34,012
        You're creaming         
      all over the place.       

230
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:36,748
 Did you go away for a moment?  

231
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:41,686
   - She's got some big hips.   

232
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:48,493
      It's a good sign of       
       a healthy uterus.        

233
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,461
       - Can we please go       
      one day without you       

234
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,597
     using the word uterus?     

235
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:55,400
         - It's my very         
    favorite word, Charles,     

236
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:57,936
       can't help myself.       

237
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:03,107
        I'm in the mood         
       for a movie today.       

238
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:04,375
              You?              

239
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:09,447
      (laughing on screen)      

240
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,786
    We should get a hooker.     

241
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:16,087
       - [Charles] What?        

242
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:17,088
       - [Thomas] Did you       
       put salt in this?        

243
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,056
          - A little.           

244
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:19,357
 - Doesn't taste like a little. 

245
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,859
    - What about the hooker?    

246
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:22,360
    - Oh, we should get one.    

247
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,228
             - Why?             

248
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,330
      - Because it's time.      

249
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:30,134
     - So, so we're really      
        going to do it?         

250
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:31,903
     You think we're ready?     

251
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,773
    - You're not chickening     
      out on me, are you?       

252
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,175
             - No.              

253
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:41,746
     I just didn't think we     
    were ready, that's all.     

254
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,615
         - We're ready.         

255
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:46,818
    We've tested ourselves,     
    and we've tested others.    

256
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,154
  I say we just push forward.   

257
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:53,157
    - So what do we do, just    
   call up an escort service?   

258
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,626
         And then what?         

259
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:56,127
  - No, no you idiot, we don't  
just call up an escort service. 

260
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,229
   That leaves a paper trail.   

261
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,832
    You're supposed to have     
   the higher IQ here, right?   

262
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:04,502
   - So what, we just pick up   
   a girl off of the street?    

263
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:06,537
     - Yes, we just pick up     
     a girl off the street,     

264
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:08,039
      take her to a motel.      

265
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,741
          - Oh, motel?          

266
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,876
  Isn't that leaving a trail?   

267
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:13,811
       - We pay cash, she       
        books the room,         

268
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:15,914
    no one sees us with her.    

269
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,181
          - All right.          

270
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:19,684
     Also we should rent a      
     car, so their hooker--     

271
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:20,718
             - No.              

272
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,820
      I don't leave paper.      

273
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:25,123
 We'll borrow our mother's car. 

274
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,558
She won't be needing it anyway. 

275
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:32,363
      - What kind of girl       
      should we get then?       

276
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:35,500
      - Any kind, doesn't       
         matter to me.          

277
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:38,069
     It's all the same meat     
       in the end anyway.       

278
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:41,706
   - Would you two dick holes   
   please shut the fuck up!?    

279
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,041
 I'm trying to watch the film.  

280
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:44,842
         Just shut up!          

281
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:49,614
 - We're not animals, Charles.  

282
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:53,217
   Though he is on the list.    

283
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:01,592
     - It shouldn't just be     
    any kind of girl though.    

284
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:06,097
     She should be special.     

285
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,267
            - Okay.             

286
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:11,803
          So you pick.          

287
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:14,405
It really doesn't matter to me. 

288
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:16,975
       (forcibly exhales)       

289
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:19,110
      - Your indifference       
        is suffocating.         

290
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:22,313
       - My indifference        
        is justifiable.         

291
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:27,051
  No one's gonna care one eye   
   about any of these girls.    

292
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:29,687
         Pretty or not.         

293
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:34,759
      (quiet eerie music)       

294
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:37,595
          - That one.           

295
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:39,964
       - That gaudy one?        

296
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:41,899
    She's decrepit Charles.     

297
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:43,234
            Why her?            

298
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:48,272
       - She's beautiful.       

299
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:52,543
     She looks like mother.     

300
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:56,314
          - All right.          

301
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:06,257
             Legs.              

302
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:17,502
        - Evening boys.         

303
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:19,971
      How can I help you?       

304
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:24,175
    - Well my brother and I     
  have carefully selected you   

305
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:26,477
   for tonight's indulgence.    

306
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:28,212
         - Selected me?         

307
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,114
          Both of ya?           

308
00:17:31,351 --> 00:17:33,618
      You wouldn't happen       
     to be cops, would ya?      

309
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:38,523
  - Oh no ma'am, just regular   
red blooded American horn dogs. 

310
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:41,526
    - Yeah, I can see that.     

311
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:44,362
 - I'm Drew, and this is Hank.  

312
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:47,432
         - Nice to meet         
       ya, Drew and Hank.       

313
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:49,233
          I'm Vanity.           

314
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,536
      - [Charles] Is that       
        your real name?         

315
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:54,472
    - No, of course it's not    
     my real fuckin' name.      

316
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:57,608
      - [Thomas] So are we      
      gonna party or what?      

317
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,178
   - I'll just get my purse.    

318
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:05,450
        (door creaking)         

319
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,958
     We could've gone some      
     place nice, you know?      

320
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,962
    - Dirty places for dirty    
     things, I always say.      

321
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:21,399
   - I'm gonna go freshen up.   

322
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:28,739
     - How should we do it?     

323
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:31,342
       - You wanna sleep        
      with her, don't you?      

324
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:36,080
   We can't rape her Charles,   
   it'll leave semen behind.    

325
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:39,283
       Even with a condom       
      it wouldn't be safe.      

326
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,652
      - Did you smell her?      

327
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:46,257
     Her scent, she stinks      
        off cooked meat.        

328
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:49,160
     - That's because it's      
       not meat brother,        

329
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:53,498
 that is the smell of impurity. 

330
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:58,336
 - So how should we do it then? 

331
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:02,473
   - Let's just roll with the   
 punches and see what develops. 

332
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:08,746
        - So what do you        
        two little pervs        

333
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,615
   wanna do with me tonight?    

334
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:12,617
     - A great many things.     

335
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,020
        - You don't have        
       to call me ma'am.        

336
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:19,790
        I'm your whore,         
      not your librarian.       

337
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,660
  Now I can be if you want to.  

338
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,798
 So we ridin' solo or tag team? 

339
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,867
   I don't do anal, usually.    

340
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:32,236
        Though I can be         
      financially coerced.      

341
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:33,404
       I don't swallow--        

342
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,740
  - This is a nonsmoking room.  

343
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,075
          - Seriously?          

344
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:40,278
      - Cigarettes are the      
     leading cause of death     

345
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,246
     in the United States.      

346
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,683
          - Okie doke.          

347
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:50,021
      Well you boys are in      
       charge, so let's--       

348
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,556
          - Oh no, no.          

349
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:54,759
   You're in charge tonight.    

350
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:58,896
We want you to take the reigns. 

351
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:03,534
  - I like your style blondie.  

352
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,736
      You can come first.       

353
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:15,780
         (guitar music)         

354
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,989
   Do you like what you see?    

355
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,493
     I've always wanted to      
      be a ballet dancer.       

356
00:20:29,495 --> 00:20:32,096
 - Yet you became a prostitute. 

357
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:33,998
       - Well life's what       
    happens when you're busy    

358
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,600
      making other plans.       

359
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:37,702
Isn't that the bullshit saying. 

360
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:40,771
       Like God works in        
   mysterious ways, whatever.   

361
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:45,676
   - How many sexual partners   
      have you had Vanity?      

362
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:47,111
            - Many.             

363
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:50,181
           Too many.            

364
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:53,317
    - What would your mother    
  think about all this Vanity?  

365
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,820
  - She'd say I hope those two  

366
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:59,890
  sexy brothers tip well dear.  

367
00:21:02,195 --> 00:21:04,362
     You know what's funny?     

368
00:21:04,364 --> 00:21:08,799
        This is actually        
      my biggest fantasy.       

369
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:13,070
       Well not exactly,        
       but close enough.        

370
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:16,240
     - What are you doing?      

371
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,746
   I'm gonna suck your cock,    
     is that okay with you?     

372
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:26,817
         (eerie music)          

373
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:31,822
           (slurping)           

374
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:38,829
       (heavy breathing)        

375
00:21:49,242 --> 00:21:51,008
   Gimme a chance to warm up!   

376
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,376
         - Get off me!          

377
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:53,544
        You disgust me.         

378
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:54,712
         - You fucker!          

379
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:56,113
 - Thomas what are you doing!?  

380
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:57,448
      - She's not the one!      

381
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,051
      - Not the one, what,      
       what do you mean!?       

382
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:02,386
- She's so impure, she's rotten!

383
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:04,955
    She can't be our first.     

384
00:22:04,957 --> 00:22:06,891
       - I'm your first?        

385
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:09,427
      (laughing mockingly)      

386
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:11,162
       - Thomas wait up!        

387
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:16,400
            Thomas!             

388
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:17,702
  - Get away from me Charles.   

389
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:19,236
           - Thomas.            

390
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:21,305
    Hey, I'm talking to you.    

391
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:22,907
      Hey, what happened!?      

392
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:24,742
       - She wasn't pure!       

393
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:29,046
   She wasn't pure, Charles.    

394
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:32,416
       She was a piece of       
        garbage nothing.        

395
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:34,352
       It was all wrong.        

396
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,420
          - All wrong?          

397
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:37,922
      How is it all wrong?      

398
00:22:37,924 --> 00:22:41,292
  We knew what she was before   
 we ever walked into that room. 

399
00:22:41,294 --> 00:22:44,462
           - No, no.            

400
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:47,398
 You see, it's the wrong tack.  

401
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,600
We're going about it all wrong. 

402
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:51,535
           - Are we?            

403
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:54,105
Or did you just lose your spine?

404
00:22:54,107 --> 00:22:55,206
  - What did you to say to me?  

405
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,474
What the hell did you say to me?

406
00:22:56,476 --> 00:22:58,342
        Don't you ever!         

407
00:22:58,344 --> 00:22:59,744
          - I'm sorry.          

408
00:22:59,746 --> 00:23:02,079
      - Don't you ever say      
       that to me again!        

409
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,949
       I did not lose my        
        spine you idiot!        

410
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:07,118
     How could you not see      
     that she wasn't right?     

411
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,820
      Or you're too stupid      
         to understand?         

412
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:11,622
    - How wasn't she right?     

413
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:15,426
 We were supposed to kill her,  
   not put her on a pedestal.   

414
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:18,129
        - That's exactly        
       my point Charles.        

415
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:20,664
       We should put them       
         on a pedestal.         

416
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,933
    At least our first one.     

417
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:27,104
  It shouldn't be some thrown   
    away street trash tramp,    

418
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:30,841
   it should be someone who's   
  death would mean something.   

419
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:33,944
Hookers get killed all the time.

420
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,546
         Life goes on.          

421
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:39,683
        We need them to         
      remember what we do       

422
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:41,786
      and who we do it to.      

423
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:44,422
       (heavy breathing)        

424
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:47,625
      - Well, we could've       
       just strung her up       

425
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:49,593
     and made it look like      
   Jack the Ripper got to her   

426
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:50,828
  and that would've made ink.   

427
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,630
            - Nooo!             

428
00:23:56,068 --> 00:24:01,138
       Keep in mind this        
       is an experiment,        

429
00:24:02,175 --> 00:24:03,307
     a test of the superior     
        intellect versus        

430
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:05,576
    the weak minded cattle.     

431
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:09,914
For it to lead to transcendence 
  it's got to mean something!   

432
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:14,785
  But for it to mean something  
   we must also make it art.    

433
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:18,889
    It must be a defiant act    
     of our above all else.     

434
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:23,327
    The victims are as much     
     part of it as we are.      

435
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:26,163
  They are the canvas Charles.  

436
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:27,398
         - Don't worry.         

437
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,132
           - And we--           

438
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:29,066
        - You will live.        

439
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:30,634
- Are the goddamn paintbrushes. 

440
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,870
      (tense eerie music)       

441
00:24:32,872 --> 00:24:35,506
    - I saw the light coming    
  out from underneath the door  

442
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:37,842
  and figured you were awake.   

443
00:24:37,844 --> 00:24:42,913
       - Yeah, I'm having       
       trouble sleeping.        

444
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:44,949
      - Anything I can do?      

445
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:48,786
 - Tuck me in, sing me a song?  

446
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:51,188
            - Okay.             

447
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:57,862
     (ambient eerie music)      

448
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:01,799
      - You look worried.       

449
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:04,134
    Is everything all right?    

450
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:06,804
       - Yeah, I'm fine.        

451
00:25:06,806 --> 00:25:08,839
   Just got a lot on my mind.   

452
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:11,509
        - You know I can        
     read you like a book.      

453
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:14,211
     Something isn't right.     

454
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:16,113
       - There's nothing.       

455
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:20,451
    - We're supposed to tell    
     each other everything.     

456
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,220
          No secrets.           

457
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,523
         Is it Thomas?          

458
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:27,424
        He's weak and--         

459
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:28,859
          - No mother.          

460
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:33,130
      Everything is fine.       

461
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:37,234
       - Hmm, boy wasn't        
     that the look you got.     

462
00:25:38,471 --> 00:25:43,541
     - Let's see, what song     
    would you like to hear?     

463
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:49,480
       - Well I could use       
       a little sunshine.       

464
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:52,883
         - You got it.          

465
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:02,426
        Sunshine baby         

466
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:05,596
        It's sunshine         

467
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:11,769
     Time to wake up baby     

468
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:16,840
        (chilling music)        

469
00:26:18,711 --> 00:26:23,714
    Oh it's sunshine baby     

470
00:26:24,784 --> 00:26:27,551
         All for you          

471
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:31,689
      (suspenseful music)       

472
00:26:31,691 --> 00:26:34,224
       - [Genevieve] Good       
       evening stranger.        

473
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:36,160
        - Hey Genevieve.        

474
00:26:36,162 --> 00:26:37,995
       - You remembered?        

475
00:26:39,532 --> 00:26:43,233
       Sit wherever, it's       
      super dead tonight.       

476
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:45,069
    - I will if you join me.    

477
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:46,370
             - Um.              

478
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:51,442
       (soft piano music)       

479
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:58,749
  Cookie dough's my favorite,   
     but we don't carry it.     

480
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:01,352
    - I've never really been    
   a big fan of cookie dough.   

481
00:27:01,354 --> 00:27:02,820
      - Most guys aren't.       

482
00:27:02,822 --> 00:27:04,955
    Maybe it's a girl thing.    

483
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:08,459
       - So I guess your        
    husband doesn't mind you    

484
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:10,594
  working the graveyard shift.  

485
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:13,330
       - I'm not married.       

486
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:15,432
     - Oh, I figured since.     

487
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:17,167
       - Getting pregnant       
      and getting married       

488
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:19,370
   can be mutually exclusive.   

489
00:27:19,372 --> 00:27:21,438
         It was just a          

490
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:25,109
    stupid time in my life.     

491
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,911
         I don't regret         
      having my daughter.       

492
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:31,215
    I love my little Maddie.    

493
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:36,086
      - You have a tattoo.      

494
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:38,722
           - Oh yeah.           

495
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:41,258
  Souvenir from the old days.   

496
00:27:42,862 --> 00:27:44,461
       - It's beautiful.        

497
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:46,764
           - Thanks.            

498
00:27:46,766 --> 00:27:48,532
        Maddie likes it.        

499
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:51,969
   So tell me about yourself.   

500
00:27:51,971 --> 00:27:53,704
        What do you do?         

501
00:27:53,706 --> 00:27:55,739
       What do you like?        

502
00:27:59,612 --> 00:28:01,311
           You okay?            

503
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:05,315
- Yeah, nervous twitch I guess. 

504
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:07,418
       - Are you nervous?       

505
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,522
          - Well yes.           

506
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:15,192
    After all I am all alone    
   with a very strange woman    

507
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:18,996
     and there's no telling     
     what you'll do to me.      

508
00:28:18,998 --> 00:28:21,198
   - You're safe in my hands.   

509
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:25,402
        - Good to know.         

510
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:28,605
    (ambient relaxing music)    

511
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:31,909
      - So what about your      
   brother, what does he do?    

512
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:33,510
        - He's a writer.        

513
00:28:33,512 --> 00:28:36,213
       He wants to write        
       true crime books,        

514
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:38,549
   he's fascinated by death.    

515
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:41,585
   - Oh, I couldn't do that.    

516
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:42,753
         There's enough         
     ugliness in the world      

517
00:28:42,755 --> 00:28:45,155
    to go digging for more.     

518
00:28:46,025 --> 00:28:48,559
         Back to work.          

519
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:50,394
       Grab a seat, I'll        
       be right with you.       

520
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:52,096
    - Are you seeing anyone?    

521
00:28:52,098 --> 00:28:53,864
      (exhales nervously)       

522
00:28:53,866 --> 00:28:55,666
          I am sorry.           

523
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:59,136
     I didn't mean to blurt     
      that out just then,       

524
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:02,573
        it's just I was         
       wondering if maybe       

525
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:05,976
    you'd like to go with me    
    to the movies sometime.     

526
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,146
  - Are you into chick flicks?  

527
00:29:09,148 --> 00:29:11,515
    - Not particularly, no.     

528
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:16,220
    - Too bad, you'll learn.    

529
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:20,023
        (police sirens)         

530
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:23,227
           (laughter)           

531
00:29:26,065 --> 00:29:31,135
        (crowd giggling)        

532
00:29:42,148 --> 00:29:43,747
        That was funny.         

533
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:48,719
        (chilling music)        

534
00:29:52,525 --> 00:29:54,691
       - You're glowing.        

535
00:29:56,529 --> 00:29:58,061
            - I am?             

536
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:02,166
        - It's blinding.        

537
00:30:02,168 --> 00:30:03,934
           - Thanks.            

538
00:30:06,272 --> 00:30:07,871
            - May I?            

539
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:09,439
            - What?             

540
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:12,543
  - I want to hold your hand.   

541
00:30:12,545 --> 00:30:14,945
          - Oh, sure.           

542
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:29,526
        - I can feel it.        

543
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:32,596
      - What did you say?       

544
00:30:32,598 --> 00:30:35,332
         - Oh, nothing.         

545
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:38,769
           I'm sorry.           

546
00:30:40,806 --> 00:30:45,876
    (cinema crowd laughing)     

547
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:54,318
- You have any cocoa chocolates?

548
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,186
      - We got movie shit.      

549
00:30:58,123 --> 00:31:00,023
- That was actually really good.

550
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:02,025
     - I would go with the      
      definition of trite.      

551
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:04,962
       - You're kidding,        
        it was so sweet.        

552
00:31:04,964 --> 00:31:06,830
       - Oh hey, you two!       

553
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:08,265
             - Hi!              

554
00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:10,267
      - I didn't know you       
    were seeing this movie.     

555
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:12,202
        Wasn't it good?         

556
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,871
   - I know, and the ending.    

557
00:31:13,873 --> 00:31:15,172
         - Who would've         
      thought he'd make it      

558
00:31:15,174 --> 00:31:16,907
       to the altar after       
       all those mishaps?       

559
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:17,975
             Right?             

560
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:18,876
            - Right!            

561
00:31:18,878 --> 00:31:20,277
        It was so good.         

562
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:22,346
 - What did you think Charles?  

563
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:27,417
  - Um, I thought it was okay.  

564
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,986
            - Okay.             

565
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:30,287
     This is the man who'd      
        argue the merits        

566
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:32,990
      of Bela Tarr's films      
     versus Bergman's work      

567
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:36,693
       and all he can say       
        is it was okay.         

568
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:39,696
       - Some films only        
        deserve an okay.        

569
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:43,033
     Can't like all art, it     
    would defeat the purpose    

570
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:45,769
       of personal intent       
         and free will.         

571
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:47,905
        - Well put sir.         

572
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:51,708
     Ugh, goddamn battery.      

573
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:54,211
     Charles do you mind if     
      I borrow your phone?      

574
00:31:54,213 --> 00:31:55,612
   My mom's watching Maddie.    

575
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:57,514
      I didn't really tell      
      her I was gonna be.       

576
00:31:57,516 --> 00:31:59,650
      - He doesn't have a       
      cell phone actually.      

577
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:03,120
 - It can lead to brain cancer. 

578
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:05,322
      - Though we do have       
        a phone at home         

579
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:08,091
       just right around        
     the corner from here.      

580
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:11,261
         - Oh, maybe I          
      should just go home.      

581
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,796
     I gotta work tonight.      

582
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:15,198
   - Don't be a silly goose,    
    come on over for lunch.     

583
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,500
     I'm an excellent cook.     

584
00:32:16,502 --> 00:32:19,603
   Hey, you like pasta, huh?    

585
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:20,704
        - I love pasta.         

586
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:21,905
          - Fantastic!          

587
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:24,107
Stay for an hour, Charles here, 

588
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,342
      he'll take you home.      

589
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,277
      You know what, call       
     Maddie, call your mom,     

590
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,612
   bring the whole clan over.   

591
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:31,181
      I'm part Italian, we      
      love big gatherings.      

592
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:33,617
        What do you say?        

593
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,185
              Huh?              

594
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:36,119
            - Okay!             

595
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,020
   (laughs enthusiastically)    

596
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:40,791
     (somber violin music)      

597
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:42,859
     - Welcome to our home.     

598
00:32:53,172 --> 00:32:54,604
              Wow.              

599
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,210
 - Just make yourself at home.  

600
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:02,546
  Phone has been on the fritz.  

601
00:33:02,548 --> 00:33:04,281
       I'm just gonna go        
       get my cell phone,       

602
00:33:04,283 --> 00:33:06,416
      I don't really care       
      about brain cancer.       

603
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:08,352
            - Okay.             

604
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:13,256
      (soft gloomy music)       

605
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:18,228
        - What were you         
     doing at the theater?      

606
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,163
         Spying on us?          

607
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,299
        - She's perfect.        

608
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:25,002
 - What are you talking about?  

609
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:26,970
   - Don't play dumb Charles.   

610
00:33:26,972 --> 00:33:30,807
  She's beautiful, she's kind,  

611
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:33,610
she's loved by those around her 

612
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:35,045
     she even is a mother.      

613
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:36,880
    She's so bloody perfect.    

614
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:38,215
             - No.              

615
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:42,552
     No, I don't think so.      

616
00:33:43,422 --> 00:33:45,722
     - You don't think so?      

617
00:33:45,724 --> 00:33:47,991
    Then why were you going     
       out with her today       

618
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:50,927
         if you weren't         
      testing the waters?       

619
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:56,266
   I'll be a monkey's uncle,    

620
00:33:57,569 --> 00:34:00,237
      you like this girl.       

621
00:34:00,239 --> 00:34:01,972
       You honest to God        
      and the baby angels       

622
00:34:01,974 --> 00:34:03,874
   actually like this girl!?    

623
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:06,009
          - She glows.          

624
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:07,878
        - What about me?        

625
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,279
  What about your big brother?  

626
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:11,882
     What am I supposed to      
      do when you kick me       

627
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:14,451
     to the curb for this,      
        for this woman!?        

628
00:34:14,453 --> 00:34:17,054
What do you even know about her?

629
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:18,822
            - Okay.             

630
00:34:18,824 --> 00:34:21,291
   - You know she's probably    
      as loose as Vanity?       

631
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:24,361
All women are the same Charles. 

632
00:34:24,363 --> 00:34:27,030
 You and I need to remain pure. 

633
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:28,799
   Have you forgotten that!?    

634
00:34:28,801 --> 00:34:31,301
         - Okay, okay.          

635
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:33,103
  - What do you want me to do?  

636
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:35,739
       You're breaking my       
      heart here Charles.       

637
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:38,008
        Am I supposed to        
      just give up on you?      

638
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,910
        Because I won't.        

639
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:41,978
     You're my baby brother     
        and it's my job         

640
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,180
       to keep you safe.        

641
00:34:43,182 --> 00:34:47,017
         - I said okay.         

642
00:34:47,019 --> 00:34:48,819
          - Atta boy.           

643
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:54,758
           You know--           

644
00:34:56,795 --> 00:35:00,163
     she is a pretty little     
       thing, isn't she?        

645
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,667
       Maybe it wouldn't        
       be a half bad idea       

646
00:35:03,669 --> 00:35:05,302
   to marry a gal like that.    

647
00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:07,737
       - Kill her Thomas.       

648
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:10,207
   - Who needs the headache?    

649
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:14,044
     If she glows like you      
      say, she's the one.       

650
00:35:14,046 --> 00:35:15,245
       She's our canvas.        

651
00:35:15,247 --> 00:35:17,214
          - Okay fine.          

652
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:18,782
       So how do we do--        

653
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:20,217
       - Follow my lead.        

654
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:32,896
 - Well as luck would have it,  

655
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:40,804
     I can't really seem to     
      find the damn thing.      

656
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:44,508
        - Oh, okay well         
       that's all right.        

657
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,476
      They can do without       
     me for an hour or so.      

658
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:47,944
          - Atta girl.          

659
00:35:47,946 --> 00:35:52,082
Now let me occupy your mind with
  some fettuccine of the gods.  

660
00:35:52,084 --> 00:35:53,717
      How does that sound?      

661
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:54,417
            - Great.            

662
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:55,218
           (giggles)            

663
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,052
            - Great.            

664
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:56,920
        Shall we shrimp?        

665
00:35:56,922 --> 00:35:57,754
         You allergic?          

666
00:35:57,756 --> 00:35:58,622
           - Nuh-uh.            

667
00:35:58,624 --> 00:36:00,757
        - Let's shrimp.         

668
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:02,893
      - [Mother] Charlie!       

669
00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:05,762
   - Charles, mother beckons.   

670
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:07,464
      - Is your mom here?       

671
00:36:07,466 --> 00:36:09,332
     - [Mother] Sweetheart!     

672
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:12,969
   - Yeah, she's, she's sick.   

673
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:16,506
      I'll be right back.       

674
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,510
      - Old lady problems.      

675
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:23,113
     - [Mother] You're not      
    being a bad boy are you?    

676
00:36:23,115 --> 00:36:25,582
        - No, no mother.        

677
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:31,154
  - Thomas isn't doing things   
 he shouldn't be doing, is he?  

678
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:34,891
   Putting ideas in your head   
  that shouldn't be put there.  

679
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:36,960
    - No mother, I promise.     

680
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:41,064
      - He's like a canker      
        sore, that boy.         

681
00:36:43,135 --> 00:36:45,902
Always trying to be the big man.

682
00:36:47,773 --> 00:36:52,042
       Oh, I'm sure glad        
       you got that look.       

683
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:58,882
        Top me off, will        
        you honey bunch?        

684
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:00,850
      - Of course mother.       

685
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:02,719
   (mother breathing heavily)   

686
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:06,489
I want to try and get some sleep

687
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:11,728
       so you can have a        
     little peace and quiet     

688
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,964
       with your friend.        

689
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:26,376
     - So Charles tells me      
   you're into serial killers   

690
00:37:26,378 --> 00:37:28,044
     and things like that.      

691
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:29,679
             - Mhm.             

692
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:33,283
    I like the obscure ones,    

693
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:37,320
   Earl Nelson, Henri Landru.   

694
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:41,391
     To a degree I consider     
    them artists, geniuses.     

695
00:37:41,393 --> 00:37:43,293
           - Really?            

696
00:37:44,129 --> 00:37:45,662
         I don't know.          

697
00:37:45,664 --> 00:37:47,964
       I mean what would        
        possess someone         

698
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:50,900
        to want to kill         
      another human being?      

699
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:55,438
 I don't consider that genius,  
    I consider it insanity.     

700
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,342
    - There are Neanderthals    
     everywhere, Genevieve.     

701
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:03,480
      There are predators       
      and there are prey.       

702
00:38:03,482 --> 00:38:08,051
      The trick is to eat       
      before you're eaten.      

703
00:38:08,053 --> 00:38:10,287
      - Well maybe that's       
       true to a degree,        

704
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:13,256
   but I don't think killing    
       should be admired.       

705
00:38:13,258 --> 00:38:15,859
      I certainly wouldn't      
      wanna live that way.      

706
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:18,295
- Then you will be swallowed up.

707
00:38:18,297 --> 00:38:20,196
    Survival of the fittest.    

708
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:24,100
     - Wow, life's already      
        swallowed me up.        

709
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:25,735
       Best I can do now        
      is teach my daughter      

710
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:28,905
        to be bigger and        
       better than mommy.       

711
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:32,776
       - All parents want       
    that, most of them fail.    

712
00:38:36,615 --> 00:38:39,716
   - Has anyone ever told you   
   you sound like an asshole?   

713
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:44,087
     - Not to my face, no.      

714
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:46,890
           Thank you.           

715
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:53,997
          - Oh my God.          

716
00:38:55,267 --> 00:38:57,567
        You are radiant.        

717
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:01,171
- Way to cover for your brother.

718
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:02,872
          - I mean it.          

719
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:05,275
        You're glorious.        

720
00:39:05,277 --> 00:39:07,510
         - Okay, okay.          

721
00:39:08,447 --> 00:39:10,447
   Let's get this over with.    

722
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:15,151
     - What are you doing?      

723
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:18,621
- We have been waiting for this 

724
00:39:18,623 --> 00:39:21,291
     for a very long time.      

725
00:39:22,227 --> 00:39:23,626
          - For what?           

726
00:39:24,663 --> 00:39:26,329
             - You.             

727
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:29,632
        You, young lady,        

728
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:33,837
 are gonna be our masterpiece.  

729
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,505
- Charles, tell him to back off.

730
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:37,941
     This shit ain't funny.     

731
00:39:37,943 --> 00:39:39,209
            - Funny?            

732
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:44,547
 You think I'm playing around,  

733
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:47,050
        Miss Genevieve?         

734
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:51,187
    What kind of hoity-toity    
      shitty name is that?      

735
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:55,191
   Stuck up bitches like you    
  are better off dead, I say.   

736
00:39:55,193 --> 00:39:56,626
      Charles, it's here--      

737
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:59,696
          (shattering)          

738
00:39:59,698 --> 00:40:01,664
           - Thomas!            

739
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:02,732
    (crashing and breaking)     

740
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:03,700
           (yelling)            

741
00:40:03,702 --> 00:40:06,369
 Thomas, Thomas, are you okay?  

742
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:08,772
         Are you okay?          

743
00:40:08,774 --> 00:40:10,707
            Thomas?             

744
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:12,275
      She's getting away.       

745
00:40:12,277 --> 00:40:13,410
  She's getting away, Thomas.   

746
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:14,577
            Come on!            

747
00:40:17,783 --> 00:40:20,383
          (trembling)           

748
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:22,786
   - Someone help me, please.   

749
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:27,157
            (crying)            

750
00:40:27,159 --> 00:40:28,291
  - [Charles] She's suffering.  

751
00:40:28,293 --> 00:40:30,560
       It's so beautiful.       

752
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:31,494
      - [Thomas] Charles?       

753
00:40:31,496 --> 00:40:33,763
- [Genevieve] Help me, help me. 

754
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:35,532
          (whimpering)          

755
00:40:35,534 --> 00:40:37,500
     - Look at her, Thomas.     

756
00:40:37,502 --> 00:40:38,168
           - Go away.           

757
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,369
         - Look at her.         

758
00:40:39,371 --> 00:40:41,237
            - Stop.             
          (trembling)           

759
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:42,806
        Charles, please.        

760
00:40:42,808 --> 00:40:45,108
 Why are you doing this to me?  

761
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:48,011
  - I'm not doing this to you.  

762
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,015
    I'm doing this for you,     

763
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:54,584
   because you're beautiful.    

764
00:40:54,586 --> 00:40:57,187
 - I didn't do anything to you. 

765
00:40:58,757 --> 00:41:01,357
         - You glowed.          

766
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:07,397
   Because you are glorious.    

767
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:16,873
      (hitting and crying)      

768
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:28,818
     (soft ethereal music)      

769
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:47,804
           (pounding)           

770
00:41:49,741 --> 00:41:54,811
    (vomiting and pounding)     

771
00:41:59,084 --> 00:42:00,917
           - Charles.           

772
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:01,751
             Stop.              

773
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:02,785
           (pounding)           

774
00:42:02,787 --> 00:42:04,854
 God damn it, Charles, stop it. 

775
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:05,622
        Leave her alone.        

776
00:42:05,624 --> 00:42:06,823
          She's dead.           

777
00:42:06,825 --> 00:42:11,794
       (heavy breathing)        

778
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:19,769
   (eerie instrumental music)   

779
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:21,971
     We took her face off.      

780
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:24,674
 We took her God damn face off. 

781
00:42:24,676 --> 00:42:26,976
       What should we do?       

782
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,446
           Oh Jesus.            

783
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:41,758
       (soft eerie music)       

784
00:42:49,634 --> 00:42:51,034
       - It's beautiful.        

785
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,370
            Thomas.             

786
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:59,108
      It was a divine act.      

787
00:43:00,045 --> 00:43:01,544
         It was divine.         

788
00:43:01,546 --> 00:43:03,746
     The universe approves.     

789
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:08,818
           (laughing)           

790
00:43:14,526 --> 00:43:16,759
  Did you see when I told her   

791
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:19,028
it was because she was glorious?

792
00:43:20,398 --> 00:43:21,965
          She smiled.           

793
00:43:23,168 --> 00:43:26,069
      Like she was giving       
         me permission.         

794
00:43:26,071 --> 00:43:28,438
  - She didn't fucking smile.   

795
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,774
        Why did you keep        
        that damn thing?        

796
00:43:32,978 --> 00:43:35,712
  - It's one of my souvenirs.   

797
00:43:38,016 --> 00:43:40,450
     What's wrong with you?     

798
00:43:42,687 --> 00:43:44,520
        You're shaking.         

799
00:43:45,423 --> 00:43:46,589
           - Nothing.           

800
00:43:46,591 --> 00:43:48,024
           Forget it.           

801
00:43:48,026 --> 00:43:51,060
     - Thomas, I know you.      

802
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:53,262
         What's wrong?          

803
00:43:53,264 --> 00:43:55,264
            I mean--            

804
00:43:55,266 --> 00:43:57,634
       We pulled it off.        

805
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:02,071
      We did it, you know?      

806
00:44:02,073 --> 00:44:03,172
            - Yeah.             

807
00:44:03,174 --> 00:44:04,941
           We did it.           

808
00:44:08,113 --> 00:44:10,213
        The problem is--        

809
00:44:11,883 --> 00:44:13,716
       I didn't like it.        

810
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,022
       It shouldn't have        
        been like that.         

811
00:44:25,363 --> 00:44:28,698
- What should it have been like?

812
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,034
        - I don't know.         

813
00:44:31,036 --> 00:44:32,602
     I don't fucking know.      

814
00:44:32,604 --> 00:44:34,404
        - You don't have        
       to curse, Thomas,        

815
00:44:34,406 --> 00:44:35,805
   there's not need for that.   

816
00:44:35,807 --> 00:44:38,107
- I don't have to fucking curse?

817
00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:40,109
       Fuck you, Charles.       

818
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:42,045
       It shouldn't have        
        felt like that.         

819
00:44:42,047 --> 00:44:43,680
          - Like what?          

820
00:44:46,885 --> 00:44:48,151
            - Pity.             

821
00:44:51,956 --> 00:44:53,623
            I felt,             

822
00:44:54,993 --> 00:44:57,226
         sorry for her.         

823
00:45:02,434 --> 00:45:04,233
            - Well.             

824
00:45:07,472 --> 00:45:09,772
I'm sorry to hear you say that. 

825
00:45:09,774 --> 00:45:14,844
     (eerie haunting music)     

826
00:45:21,686 --> 00:45:24,587
         (door opening)         

827
00:45:24,589 --> 00:45:27,256
 - Swinberg, long time no see.  

828
00:45:27,258 --> 00:45:28,291
              Hey!              

829
00:45:29,994 --> 00:45:31,060
       How are the kids.        

830
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:32,862
    - I don't have children.    

831
00:45:32,864 --> 00:45:34,597
  - I meant you're balls, pal.  

832
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:36,299
You have testicle cancer, right?

833
00:45:36,301 --> 00:45:38,034
     - Yeah, how did you--      

834
00:45:38,036 --> 00:45:38,968
             Right.             

835
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:40,536
         They're fine.          

836
00:45:40,538 --> 00:45:41,971
     They're in remission.      

837
00:45:41,973 --> 00:45:42,972
 - So, I'm coming in late here. 

838
00:45:42,974 --> 00:45:43,840
          Fill me in.           

839
00:45:43,842 --> 00:45:46,209
       - Female, age 26.        

840
00:45:49,481 --> 00:45:51,647
  - Jesus, what is this, man?   

841
00:45:51,649 --> 00:45:53,116
       - We found her off       
     the side of the road,      

842
00:45:53,118 --> 00:45:54,550
     off Cold Water Canyon.     

843
00:45:54,552 --> 00:45:57,353
Someone took a rock to her face,

844
00:45:57,355 --> 00:45:58,821
        multiple times.         

845
00:45:58,823 --> 00:46:00,356
        - Rock for sure?        

846
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:01,591
  - Well, we couldn't find it.  

847
00:46:01,593 --> 00:46:04,393
       But, all the rock        
      debris in her wounds      

848
00:46:04,395 --> 00:46:07,830
   is consistent with a rock    
     as the murder weapon.      

849
00:46:07,832 --> 00:46:08,931
      - No prints on her?       

850
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:10,032
      - No, she was clean.      

851
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:11,267
 We're still waiting on fibers, 

852
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:13,369
      but the site wasn't       
       exactly pristine,        

853
00:46:13,371 --> 00:46:15,037
    so it may take a while.     

854
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,140
        Also, we found a        
     patch of skin missing      

855
00:46:17,142 --> 00:46:18,841
     behind her right ear.      

856
00:46:18,843 --> 00:46:20,643
   It looks hastily removed.    

857
00:46:20,645 --> 00:46:22,612
    Probably a trophy piece.    

858
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:24,647
      - Of course it was.       

859
00:46:24,649 --> 00:46:27,350
   He probably framed it too.   

860
00:46:30,855 --> 00:46:32,688
         Okay, darling.         

861
00:46:34,058 --> 00:46:37,560
   Let's see if we can't find   
    out who did this to you.    

862
00:46:37,562 --> 00:46:40,029
           (gasping)            

863
00:46:49,274 --> 00:46:50,740
       - Up for a movie?        

864
00:46:50,742 --> 00:46:51,741
        (pouring coffee)        

865
00:46:51,743 --> 00:46:53,209
        I'm in the mood.        

866
00:46:53,211 --> 00:46:54,510
           - I'm not.           

867
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:02,251
       - You can have it.       

868
00:47:02,253 --> 00:47:05,221
I wasn't going to eat it anyway.

869
00:47:05,223 --> 00:47:05,888
      - How did you know?       

870
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:06,622
          - I saw it.           

871
00:47:08,927 --> 00:47:12,461
       I think I can see        
        everything now.         

872
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:14,730
          (chuckling)           

873
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:20,002
         - Sorry, boys.         

874
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:21,204
  Didn't mean to startle you.   

875
00:47:21,206 --> 00:47:22,338
       May I cop a squat?       

876
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,272
         Pun intended.          

877
00:47:23,274 --> 00:47:26,275
     - Of course, Officer.      

878
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:27,310
       - It's Detective.        

879
00:47:27,312 --> 00:47:29,111
     Detective Homer Gaul.      

880
00:47:29,113 --> 00:47:30,479
As long as we've got that clear,

881
00:47:30,481 --> 00:47:32,348
        you can call me         
       Homer, we're pals.       

882
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:35,384
       - Well, how can we       
        help you, Homer?        

883
00:47:35,386 --> 00:47:38,921
     - Not sure if you boys     
    have heard the bad news,    

884
00:47:38,923 --> 00:47:40,990
   but one of the waitresses    
        that worked here        

885
00:47:40,992 --> 00:47:44,794
       was found murdered       
        late last night.        

886
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:47,296
            - Oh no.            

887
00:47:47,298 --> 00:47:49,632
       My goodness, who?        

888
00:47:49,634 --> 00:47:51,400
   - Oh, pretty little thing.   

889
00:47:51,402 --> 00:47:54,070
    Named Genevieve Du Bois.    

890
00:47:54,072 --> 00:47:56,372
       You boys know her.       

891
00:47:59,844 --> 00:48:02,211
  - We knew her somewhat, yes.  

892
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:05,882
      She would wait on us      
   whenever we came in here.    

893
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:11,787
   - Well, that's the reason    
     I'm bugging you folks.     

894
00:48:11,789 --> 00:48:14,624
        You see, I asked        
    Angelo, the owner here,     

895
00:48:14,626 --> 00:48:16,826
      to pick out for me a      
      few of the regulars,      

896
00:48:16,828 --> 00:48:17,960
    and he fingered you two,    

897
00:48:17,962 --> 00:48:19,729
      among a few others.       

898
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:24,700
    - Well, we are certainly    
  regulars, aren't we Thomas?   

899
00:48:24,702 --> 00:48:26,535
           - Uh, yes.           

900
00:48:26,537 --> 00:48:30,539
- And, you two are what friends?

901
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:32,108
            Lovers?             

902
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:34,176
        Nothing unsavory        
      or illegal going on       

903
00:48:34,178 --> 00:48:36,112
   under this table is there?   

904
00:48:36,114 --> 00:48:37,146
          (chuckling)           

905
00:48:37,148 --> 00:48:38,981
  - No, Homer, we're brothers.  

906
00:48:38,983 --> 00:48:42,485
   I'm Charles Brubaker, and    
   this is Thomas Lo Bianco.    

907
00:48:42,487 --> 00:48:44,353
       - Different dads?        

908
00:48:44,355 --> 00:48:45,588
         - You got it.          

909
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:49,592
       You must be really       
      good at what you do.      

910
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:51,460
       - You flatter me.        

911
00:48:51,462 --> 00:48:52,962
           (chuckles)           

912
00:48:53,765 --> 00:48:55,064
          It's a gift.          

913
00:48:55,066 --> 00:48:57,266
   - Here you go, Detective.    

914
00:48:57,268 --> 00:49:01,203
      - Ah, Homer, please,      
     we're pals, remember?      

915
00:49:01,205 --> 00:49:05,775
     Now, lemme-- (sipping)     

916
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:10,279
              Mmm!              

917
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:11,781
              Oh!               

918
00:49:11,783 --> 00:49:15,051
      Oh, Angelo, Angelo,       
        Angelo, Angelo.         

919
00:49:15,053 --> 00:49:16,986
       This is the first        
       time I've actually       

920
00:49:16,988 --> 00:49:20,323
     tasted coffee the way      
    it was meant to be made.    

921
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:23,592
    (chuckling and sipping)     

922
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:25,394
              Mmm!              

923
00:49:26,898 --> 00:49:29,198
  Have you tried this coffee?   

924
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,499
          Astounding!           

925
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:34,203
       It's like cinnamon       
     and Jesus had a baby.      

926
00:49:34,205 --> 00:49:37,306
  - Don't trust him, Charles.   

927
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:38,841
           Kill him.            

928
00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:42,778
        - You boys ever         
      chat with Genevieve?      

929
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,880
         See her at all         
      outside this place?       

930
00:49:44,882 --> 00:49:47,083
     - I can't say we have.     

931
00:49:47,085 --> 00:49:49,385
       Wanted to though.        

932
00:49:49,387 --> 00:49:51,754
     She sure was a pretty      
      young little thing,       

933
00:49:51,756 --> 00:49:54,190
         like you said.         

934
00:49:54,192 --> 00:49:55,391
            - Yeah.             

935
00:49:55,393 --> 00:49:57,293
        Of course, I was        
      going off pictures.       

936
00:49:57,295 --> 00:49:59,662
      Whoever killed her--      

937
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:04,233
  Man, those twisted bastards   
  really did a number on her.   

938
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:06,836
     - How was she killed?      

939
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:07,970
           - Charles!           

940
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:14,410
      - It really wouldn't      
     help the investigation     

941
00:50:14,412 --> 00:50:16,379
      if I started running      
         my mouth about         

942
00:50:16,381 --> 00:50:19,949
    the sensitive details of    
    the case, now would it?     

943
00:50:19,951 --> 00:50:21,717
    Turn on the local news.     

944
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:25,821
 I imagine all the gory details 
   will be in the 6 o'clock.    

945
00:50:26,891 --> 00:50:31,761
      Now, if I wanted to       
    reach you fellas again,     

946
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:34,764
      how would I do that?      

947
00:50:34,766 --> 00:50:38,701
- Well, this is our home number.

948
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:41,904
       And that's in gold       
         leaf too, FYI.         

949
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:49,712
   - Pals, I wanna thank you.   

950
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:53,382
     - Ah, ah, ah, Thomas,      
        manners, please.        

951
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:54,617
   - Is it something I said?    

952
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:58,220
     My aunt always told me     
      to modulate my tone.      

953
00:50:58,222 --> 00:50:59,522
    I hope I haven't been--     

954
00:50:59,524 --> 00:51:01,323
- No, it's just that we're sick.

955
00:51:01,325 --> 00:51:02,992
  Wouldn't want to spread it.   

956
00:51:02,994 --> 00:51:06,362
       Besides, you have        
       work to do, Homer.       

957
00:51:06,364 --> 00:51:10,466
     Taking a sick day now      
   would just slow you down.    

958
00:51:10,468 --> 00:51:14,170
      - That's really very      
       thoughtful of you.       

959
00:51:17,508 --> 00:51:20,976
        Talk soon, pals.        

960
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:24,880
 Hey, can I talk to you folks.  

961
00:51:24,882 --> 00:51:26,782
     - Did you see his cup?     

962
00:51:26,784 --> 00:51:28,317
        He had the glow.        

963
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,686
       - He came over to        
        shake our hands.        

964
00:51:30,688 --> 00:51:33,255
     - How can you be sure?     

965
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,133
  - How 'bout a foreign film?   

966
00:51:44,135 --> 00:51:45,935
        Something long.         

967
00:51:48,339 --> 00:51:50,306
    - I'm not feeling well.     

968
00:51:50,308 --> 00:51:52,174
         Take me home.          

969
00:51:52,176 --> 00:51:54,910
 - Suit yourself, party pooper. 

970
00:51:56,747 --> 00:51:58,948
           (kissing)            

971
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:01,383
  - Oh, let's take a picture.   

972
00:52:06,691 --> 00:52:07,990
        (camera shutter)        

973
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,726
       - That one's good.       

974
00:52:10,728 --> 00:52:14,830
     (kissing and moaning)      

975
00:52:14,832 --> 00:52:16,899
             - Shh!             

976
00:52:20,705 --> 00:52:25,774
     (kissing and giggling)     

977
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:35,718
     Excuse me, old timer.      

978
00:52:43,861 --> 00:52:48,797
     (kissing and giggling)     

979
00:53:03,748 --> 00:53:08,817
            (typing)            

980
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:13,856
      (suspenseful music)       

981
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:18,894
 (slurping and dramatic music)  

982
00:53:55,099 --> 00:53:56,765
      - My God, you pervs.      

983
00:53:56,767 --> 00:53:57,533
        Get out of here.        

984
00:53:57,535 --> 00:53:58,767
         Out, out, out.         

985
00:53:58,769 --> 00:54:00,336
    Hurry, move, move, move.    

986
00:54:00,338 --> 00:54:01,337
    Have I seen you before?     

987
00:54:01,339 --> 00:54:02,805
       Move, move, move.        

988
00:54:02,807 --> 00:54:07,843
   (eerie suspenseful music)    

989
00:54:23,794 --> 00:54:25,361
         - Psychic cop.         

990
00:54:27,365 --> 00:54:30,065
        You've gotta be         
      fucking kidding me.       

991
00:54:31,736 --> 00:54:35,804
        (pouring drink)         

992
00:54:44,815 --> 00:54:47,783
       (squeaking wheels)       

993
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:01,530
        - Mrs. Du Bois?         

994
00:55:01,532 --> 00:55:03,932
    - Oh, hello, Detective.     

995
00:55:03,934 --> 00:55:05,267
        - How we doin'?         

996
00:55:05,269 --> 00:55:06,302
      - Well, we're just--      

997
00:55:06,304 --> 00:55:09,071
     trying to stay strong.     

998
00:55:09,073 --> 00:55:10,873
            For her.            

999
00:55:12,343 --> 00:55:14,643
      - Hey there, Maddie.      

1000
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:19,014
    - Honey, this is the man    
 that I was telling you about.  

1001
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:20,649
    - Can I shake your hand?    

1002
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:23,786
         (eerie music)          

1003
00:55:23,788 --> 00:55:25,120
      - Well, if you guys       
        need a fill up,         

1004
00:55:25,122 --> 00:55:27,156
       just let me know.        

1005
00:55:37,568 --> 00:55:40,703
 - Thank you for that, Sweetie. 

1006
00:55:40,705 --> 00:55:43,405
    Oh, I'm so sorry, honey.    

1007
00:55:44,608 --> 00:55:47,976
       - You know, you're       
       kind of her hero.        

1008
00:55:47,978 --> 00:55:50,446
     - She's kind of mine.      

1009
00:55:51,215 --> 00:55:53,882
      I promise on my life      

1010
00:55:53,884 --> 00:55:55,751
that I will find the bad people 

1011
00:55:55,753 --> 00:55:58,987
      who did this to your      
   wonderful beautiful mommy.   

1012
00:56:00,091 --> 00:56:02,257
          It's my job,          

1013
00:56:02,259 --> 00:56:06,395
      to make sure little       
        girls don't cry.        

1014
00:56:06,397 --> 00:56:08,030
      You can count on me.      

1015
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:09,932
             Okay?              

1016
00:56:13,137 --> 00:56:15,804
          I'm the axe,          

1017
00:56:15,806 --> 00:56:19,007
and they're the big bad wolves. 

1018
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:27,783
     (creaking floorboards)     

1019
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:29,985
         - Who is that?         

1020
00:56:30,788 --> 00:56:32,688
     Who the fuck is that?      

1021
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:34,790
           (crashing)           

1022
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:49,805
          (whistling)           

1023
00:56:57,081 --> 00:57:00,382
         - Here we go.          

1024
00:57:00,384 --> 00:57:01,617
        Ham and cheese.         

1025
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:04,119
       - Mmm, extra mayo?       

1026
00:57:04,121 --> 00:57:07,990
  - Extra extra mayo, my dear.  

1027
00:57:07,992 --> 00:57:10,259
      Now, I have to dash,      

1028
00:57:10,261 --> 00:57:11,794
  but Thomas will be here if--  

1029
00:57:11,796 --> 00:57:12,895
             - No.              

1030
00:57:12,897 --> 00:57:15,197
 I'm turning in early tonight.  

1031
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:16,565
           Hopefully.           

1032
00:57:16,567 --> 00:57:18,567
          - Oh, okay.           

1033
00:57:18,569 --> 00:57:20,335
  - [Charles] Down the hatch.   

1034
00:57:20,337 --> 00:57:23,238
      - Over the lips and       
       through the gums.        

1035
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:27,409
         - Sleep well.          

1036
00:57:27,411 --> 00:57:29,044
        - Be a good boy.        

1037
00:57:29,046 --> 00:57:32,781
- I'll be the very best, mother.

1038
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:37,820
           (humming)            

1039
00:57:37,822 --> 00:57:39,755
- What are you gonna do tonight?

1040
00:57:39,757 --> 00:57:41,790
         - Just drive.          

1041
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:43,058
    We'll see what develops.    

1042
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:44,293
- [Thomas] You're not going to--

1043
00:57:44,295 --> 00:57:47,763
     - If the spirit moves      
    me, I shall allow it to.    

1044
00:57:47,765 --> 00:57:50,265
      - You remember that       
     cop from this morning?     

1045
00:57:50,267 --> 00:57:51,400
         - Who, Homer?          

1046
00:57:51,402 --> 00:57:53,235
 - He's supposed to be psychic. 

1047
00:57:53,237 --> 00:57:54,670
           (laughing)           

1048
00:57:54,672 --> 00:57:56,371
          - I knew it!          

1049
00:57:56,373 --> 00:57:59,808
   Something told me to keep    
    you away from his hand.     

1050
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:02,277
         That's why his         
      drink had the glow.       

1051
00:58:02,279 --> 00:58:05,848
        - He's got a 98%        
  conviction record, Charles.   

1052
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:08,917
            - Well.             

1053
00:58:09,954 --> 00:58:11,787
     All we can do is hope.     

1054
00:58:11,789 --> 00:58:13,489
            - What?             

1055
00:58:15,726 --> 00:58:19,795
     - That we fall within      
        that golden 2%.         

1056
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,799
          - He knows.           

1057
00:58:23,801 --> 00:58:25,501
       I'm sure he knows.       

1058
00:58:25,503 --> 00:58:29,171
       - Thomas, psychic        
   intuition is not evidence.   

1059
00:58:29,173 --> 00:58:33,942
      Even if he's really       
       really good at it.       

1060
00:58:33,944 --> 00:58:35,944
          He may know,          

1061
00:58:35,946 --> 00:58:39,548
 but he still has to prove it.  

1062
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:41,517
       We are above this,       

1063
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:43,719
    and we always have been.    

1064
00:58:43,721 --> 00:58:45,654
          (chuckling)           

1065
00:58:45,656 --> 00:58:49,791
   (door opening and closing)   

1066
00:58:57,701 --> 00:58:59,501
         (door opening)         

1067
00:59:02,006 --> 00:59:05,541
Do you know where the keys are. 

1068
00:59:05,543 --> 00:59:07,242
           - Um, no.            

1069
00:59:08,212 --> 00:59:10,512
       How should I know?       

1070
00:59:11,515 --> 00:59:16,418
 - Thomas, are you lying to me? 

1071
00:59:18,822 --> 00:59:20,556
      - What do you say we      
    just stay home tonight,     

1072
00:59:20,558 --> 00:59:21,490
           get drunk,           

1073
00:59:21,492 --> 00:59:22,724
and watch some reality TV crap? 

1074
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:26,628
- Oh, but that's boring, Thomas.

1075
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:28,697
         And if there's         
       one things I hate,       

1076
00:59:28,699 --> 00:59:30,766
         it's boredom.          

1077
00:59:32,202 --> 00:59:33,835
              Now-              

1078
00:59:35,372 --> 00:59:37,039
That bulge in your right pocket 

1079
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:40,842
     wouldn't happen to be      
      the keys, would it?       

1080
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:43,879
        (keys jingling)         

1081
00:59:44,882 --> 00:59:46,481
           Thank you.           

1082
00:59:48,152 --> 00:59:51,920
    What would I do without     
       you, big brother?        

1083
00:59:55,759 --> 01:00:00,829
          (whistling)           

1084
01:00:02,299 --> 01:00:03,899
         (door closing)         

1085
01:00:13,844 --> 01:00:16,244
     Well, hello gorgeous.      

1086
01:00:16,246 --> 01:00:18,146
         - Well, well.          

1087
01:00:18,148 --> 01:00:20,782
      Where's Tweedledum?       

1088
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:22,451
        - He's at home.         

1089
01:00:23,387 --> 01:00:25,621
       He's a little shy.       

1090
01:00:25,623 --> 01:00:28,023
        Doesn't know how        
        to treat a lady.        

1091
01:00:28,993 --> 01:00:30,826
         - But you do?          

1092
01:00:30,828 --> 01:00:32,928
  - Only one way to find out.   

1093
01:01:00,724 --> 01:01:03,825
      (door creaking open)      

1094
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:10,899
          (screaming)           

1095
01:01:10,901 --> 01:01:12,768
           (crashing)           

1096
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:16,038
  (suspenseful dramatic music)  

1097
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:21,743
       - Same room, huh?        

1098
01:01:21,745 --> 01:01:24,279
        Maybe you should        
     rent it by the month.      

1099
01:01:24,281 --> 01:01:27,749
     - It's not going to be     
   very clean after tonight.    

1100
01:01:29,053 --> 01:01:33,121
       - Things gonna get       
        dirty, are they?        

1101
01:01:33,123 --> 01:01:35,624
     - You could say that.      

1102
01:01:35,626 --> 01:01:36,858
            - Yeah?             

1103
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:39,428
        You look like a         
       nasty little boy.        

1104
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:42,731
     - I have no intention      
         of kissing you         

1105
01:01:42,733 --> 01:01:45,734
or the 1000 cocks you've sucked.

1106
01:01:45,736 --> 01:01:47,436
         - Well, fuck.          

1107
01:01:47,438 --> 01:01:49,571
        Tell me how you         
     really feel about me.      

1108
01:01:49,573 --> 01:01:51,073
    I'm gonna go freshen up.    

1109
01:01:51,075 --> 01:01:53,241
        - Take a shower.        

1110
01:01:54,611 --> 01:01:57,913
    With soap and hot water.    

1111
01:01:57,915 --> 01:02:00,515
    I want you to be clean.     

1112
01:02:02,019 --> 01:02:04,219
          Put this on.          

1113
01:02:07,691 --> 01:02:09,357
            You see,            

1114
01:02:10,961 --> 01:02:14,529
     I'm going to eat you,      

1115
01:02:14,531 --> 01:02:17,365
       from head to toe.        

1116
01:02:21,004 --> 01:02:23,672
        - Sounds like a         
     Saturday night to me.      

1117
01:02:24,742 --> 01:02:29,811
         (eerie music)          

1118
01:02:37,621 --> 01:02:39,321
         (gun cocking)          

1119
01:02:39,323 --> 01:02:41,423
  - Okay, you no-faced bitch.   

1120
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:43,425
        Come and get me.        

1121
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:48,363
       (heavy breathing)        

1122
01:02:49,133 --> 01:02:50,465
           Come out,            

1123
01:02:50,467 --> 01:02:51,433
           Come out,            

1124
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:53,735
       Wherever you are.        

1125
01:02:53,737 --> 01:02:58,807
    (eerie suspenseful music    
      and heavy breathing)      

1126
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:18,527
            Oh shit!            

1127
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,533
            Oh fuck!            

1128
01:03:31,675 --> 01:03:33,608
           (crashing)           

1129
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:38,680
(heavy breathing and struggling)

1130
01:03:39,349 --> 01:03:43,819
    (dramatic horror music)     

1131
01:03:54,064 --> 01:03:54,896
           Oh Jesus.            

1132
01:03:54,898 --> 01:03:55,730
        No, no, no, no.         

1133
01:03:55,732 --> 01:03:56,631
     No, no, no, Genevieve.     

1134
01:03:56,633 --> 01:03:57,499
            Please.             

1135
01:03:57,501 --> 01:03:58,800
           I'm sorry.           

1136
01:03:58,802 --> 01:04:00,268
     I'm so fucking sorry.      

1137
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:01,803
         I'm so sorry.          

1138
01:04:01,805 --> 01:04:04,840
      No, no, no, no, no.       

1139
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:06,541
    Please, please, please.     

1140
01:04:06,543 --> 01:04:07,809
           I'm sorry.           

1141
01:04:07,811 --> 01:04:08,777
     I'm so fucking sorry.      

1142
01:04:08,779 --> 01:04:09,578
            No, no.             

1143
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:10,979
    Please, please, please.     

1144
01:04:10,981 --> 01:04:12,280
           No, fuck.            

1145
01:04:12,282 --> 01:04:12,948
             Sorry.             

1146
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:13,748
           I'm sorry.           

1147
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:14,416
     I'm so fucking sorry.      

1148
01:04:14,418 --> 01:04:15,350
          No, no, no.           

1149
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:19,654
   (whimpering and trembling)   

1150
01:04:22,726 --> 01:04:27,796
 (screaming in pain and crying) 

1151
01:04:32,669 --> 01:04:34,769
           - Thomas!            

1152
01:04:36,807 --> 01:04:39,708
     - You see, my brother      
      and I have a theory.      

1153
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:43,812
   We once saw a cat get run    
 over by a car when we were 6.  

1154
01:04:45,182 --> 01:04:47,082
    A week later the carcass    
   hadn't been picked up yet,   

1155
01:04:47,084 --> 01:04:49,851
but where it laid in the grass, 

1156
01:04:49,853 --> 01:04:53,321
       a patch of daisies       
        just sprung up.         

1157
01:04:55,025 --> 01:04:57,559
 That's where we first saw it.  

1158
01:04:59,296 --> 01:05:00,795
          - Saw what?           

1159
01:05:00,797 --> 01:05:03,999
- The divine tragedies of life. 

1160
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:08,904
      God's love in death.      

1161
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:13,909
Beauty amongst ugliness and rot.

1162
01:05:16,013 --> 01:05:18,680
       - Are you a bible        
     thumper or something?      

1163
01:05:18,682 --> 01:05:20,348
             - No.              

1164
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:23,051
         No, we haven't         
       written our bible.       

1165
01:05:24,988 --> 01:05:26,521
            Not yet.            

1166
01:05:27,391 --> 01:05:28,990
            But you.            

1167
01:05:31,295 --> 01:05:33,261
       You're very lucky.       

1168
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:35,397
           - Oh yeah?           

1169
01:05:35,399 --> 01:05:37,899
          Why's that?           

1170
01:05:37,901 --> 01:05:41,636
    - You will be our second    
     step toward divinity.      

1171
01:05:42,606 --> 01:05:43,972
You see, when I said that I was 

1172
01:05:43,974 --> 01:05:47,108
        going to eat you        
       from head to toe,        

1173
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:51,680
       I meant that I was       
    going to eat all of you.    

1174
01:05:51,682 --> 01:05:53,348
           Your skin.           

1175
01:05:54,251 --> 01:05:56,551
          Your heart.           

1176
01:05:56,553 --> 01:05:58,653
          Your liver.           

1177
01:05:58,655 --> 01:05:59,854
         Your pancreas.         

1178
01:05:59,856 --> 01:06:01,556
          Your spleen.          

1179
01:06:01,558 --> 01:06:02,991
         Your ovaries.          

1180
01:06:02,993 --> 01:06:04,526
        Your everything.        

1181
01:06:04,528 --> 01:06:05,593
    - What the fuck do you--    

1182
01:06:05,595 --> 01:06:08,797
    (screaming and crashing)    

1183
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:10,999
          (screaming)           

1184
01:06:11,001 --> 01:06:15,870
            (crying)            

1185
01:06:17,808 --> 01:06:22,344
   (laughing and radio music)   

1186
01:06:22,346 --> 01:06:24,746
 - This is one of my favorites. 

1187
01:06:24,748 --> 01:06:29,818
      (alternative music)       

1188
01:06:31,722 --> 01:06:34,289
         I can kill you         
       first if you like,       

1189
01:06:34,291 --> 01:06:38,326
    but you have to promise     
     to be quiet, my dear.      

1190
01:06:39,396 --> 01:06:42,998
        Vanity, come on.        

1191
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,132
          - Fuck you.           

1192
01:06:44,134 --> 01:06:46,167
 (spraying and dramatic music)  

1193
01:06:46,169 --> 01:06:50,939
     (screaming and crying)     

1194
01:06:54,144 --> 01:06:56,644
 - What did you do, you bitch?  

1195
01:06:56,646 --> 01:06:58,380
       You fucking bitch.       

1196
01:06:58,382 --> 01:06:59,581
         What the fuck?         

1197
01:06:59,583 --> 01:07:00,815
           (crashing)           

1198
01:07:00,817 --> 01:07:05,854
      (alternative music)       

1199
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:16,164
        - What the hell?        

1200
01:07:19,736 --> 01:07:21,703
    (trembling and ripping)     

1201
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:23,705
           Oh Jesus.            

1202
01:07:23,707 --> 01:07:28,777
       (heavy breathing)        

1203
01:07:32,616 --> 01:07:34,916
         What the hell?         

1204
01:07:36,686 --> 01:07:38,720
         (splattering)          

1205
01:07:38,722 --> 01:07:40,855
       Oh, Jesus Christ.        

1206
01:07:42,859 --> 01:07:44,559
          (screaming)           

1207
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:46,795
         What the fuck?         

1208
01:07:46,797 --> 01:07:50,899
          (screaming)           

1209
01:07:52,836 --> 01:07:56,071
           Oh, Jesus.           

1210
01:07:58,708 --> 01:08:03,778
      (heaving breathing)       

1211
01:08:19,696 --> 01:08:24,732
           (coughing)           

1212
01:08:27,637 --> 01:08:29,804
          - Oh my God.          

1213
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:33,875
           (coughing)           

1214
01:08:46,723 --> 01:08:49,858
  - So how long does something  
    like this usually take?     

1215
01:08:52,696 --> 01:08:55,797
        - Depends on how        
     willing the spirit is.     

1216
01:08:56,967 --> 01:08:59,434
    Sometimes a day or two,     

1217
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:02,470
      sometimes instantly.      

1218
01:09:06,676 --> 01:09:09,144
       - [Swinberg] And,        
        what do you see?        

1219
01:09:09,146 --> 01:09:12,113
 Is it like pictures, or what?  

1220
01:09:12,115 --> 01:09:14,015
          - Anything.           

1221
01:09:15,318 --> 01:09:17,619
   Sometimes the last images,   

1222
01:09:17,621 --> 01:09:21,156
       sometimes bits and       
        pieces, voices,         

1223
01:09:23,393 --> 01:09:26,194
 and it completely takes me in. 

1224
01:09:28,231 --> 01:09:30,365
        I see all of it.        

1225
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:36,304
        - And with her?         

1226
01:09:36,306 --> 01:09:37,805
          - With her--          

1227
01:09:44,714 --> 01:09:49,784
       (eerie soft music)       

1228
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,320
       I'm with you now.        

1229
01:09:53,757 --> 01:09:55,924
           I'm here.            

1230
01:09:57,727 --> 01:09:59,727
          Talk to me.           

1231
01:10:00,931 --> 01:10:02,630
          Talk to me.           

1232
01:10:03,633 --> 01:10:05,833
       Did you know them.       

1233
01:10:07,204 --> 01:10:08,636
             Good.              

1234
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:12,540
    That's good, sweetheart.    

1235
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:16,177
      You have to tell me       
    their names, Genevieve.     

1236
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:21,783
          Don't worry.          

1237
01:10:21,785 --> 01:10:24,886
  They can't hurt you anymore.  

1238
01:10:24,888 --> 01:10:29,891
 Talk to me, so I can make sure 
  they don't get away with it.  

1239
01:10:31,294 --> 01:10:33,962
     - They'll hurt Maddie.     

1240
01:10:33,964 --> 01:10:36,364
         - She's safe.          

1241
01:10:36,366 --> 01:10:40,335
        I sent her away         
       with your mother.        

1242
01:10:40,337 --> 01:10:43,304
      I won't let anything      
         happen to her.         

1243
01:10:44,207 --> 01:10:46,774
           I promise.           

1244
01:10:46,776 --> 01:10:50,878
    Now, talk to me, please.    

1245
01:10:56,753 --> 01:10:58,820
     (sharp dramatic music)     

1246
01:11:03,493 --> 01:11:06,828
      She's being stubborn      
     because she's scared.      

1247
01:11:09,332 --> 01:11:12,100
        But I know there        
       were two of them.        

1248
01:11:12,102 --> 01:11:17,005
    One did all the killing     
     and the other watched.     

1249
01:11:21,678 --> 01:11:26,714
       (eerie soft music)       

1250
01:11:27,817 --> 01:11:32,887
(suspenseful music and moaning) 

1251
01:11:36,393 --> 01:11:38,926
     - [Voiceover] Almost.      

1252
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:46,501
        Yes, that's it.         

1253
01:11:57,380 --> 01:12:00,848
           (humming)            

1254
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:02,984
     - Hi, how's it goin'?      

1255
01:12:02,986 --> 01:12:04,752
        - Shut up, bro.         

1256
01:12:04,754 --> 01:12:08,656
   (talking on movie screen)    

1257
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:11,693
   (suspenseful horror music)   

1258
01:12:11,695 --> 01:12:16,531
(engine running and turning off)

1259
01:12:21,204 --> 01:12:23,271
        (keys jingling)         

1260
01:12:23,273 --> 01:12:24,806
      (car door shutting)       

1261
01:12:29,612 --> 01:12:32,347
   - Hey, hey, I caught you.    

1262
01:12:38,355 --> 01:12:41,222
       I tried the door,        
        no one answered.        

1263
01:12:41,224 --> 01:12:43,858
     Figured you were out,      
     figured I would wait.      

1264
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:47,161
  Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, my   
   boy, what happened to you?   

1265
01:12:47,163 --> 01:12:50,598
       - I fell down the        
       stairs, Detective.       

1266
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:53,134
         - It's Homer,          
      we're pals, please.       

1267
01:12:53,136 --> 01:12:54,669
       Does it hurt much.       

1268
01:12:54,671 --> 01:12:55,770
  My wife always says onion--   

1269
01:12:55,772 --> 01:12:58,106
  - How can I help you, Homer?  

1270
01:12:59,743 --> 01:13:02,543
    - Well, I wanted to ask     
    a few followup questions    

1271
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:05,146
      if you have a spare       
        second or three.        

1272
01:13:07,584 --> 01:13:11,386
        - Alright, okay,        
       yeah, okay, sure.        

1273
01:13:11,388 --> 01:13:15,723
       Is this about the        
     whole waitress thing?      

1274
01:13:15,725 --> 01:13:17,425
          - Yeah, pal.          

1275
01:13:17,427 --> 01:13:20,528
     I'm afraid it's about      
   the whole waitress thing.    

1276
01:13:21,931 --> 01:13:23,231
           - Alright.           

1277
01:13:27,937 --> 01:13:29,470
       Here's your water.       

1278
01:13:29,472 --> 01:13:31,639
        - Oh, thank you.        

1279
01:13:31,641 --> 01:13:33,107
            - Yeah.             

1280
01:13:33,109 --> 01:13:35,009
  - So, where's your brother?   

1281
01:13:35,011 --> 01:13:38,312
    - He's around somewhere.    

1282
01:13:45,121 --> 01:13:48,022
I don't really keep tabs on him.

1283
01:13:48,024 --> 01:13:49,690
       - That's curious.        

1284
01:13:49,692 --> 01:13:53,194
       I figured you two        
     for being very close.      

1285
01:13:54,197 --> 01:13:56,731
        - Well, we are.         

1286
01:13:58,067 --> 01:13:59,967
            Sort of.            

1287
01:13:59,969 --> 01:14:01,702
           - Sort of?           

1288
01:14:02,539 --> 01:14:04,272
           Well now.            

1289
01:14:05,608 --> 01:14:08,543
       Probably off with        
        his girlfriend.         

1290
01:14:08,545 --> 01:14:10,678
       - Charles doesn't        
       have a girlfriend.       

1291
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,480
         - He doesn't?          

1292
01:14:12,482 --> 01:14:15,283
        Well, no dancing        
       car for him then.        

1293
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:19,587
     You're the lady killer     
      in the family, huh?       

1294
01:14:19,589 --> 01:14:21,589
   - I don't know about that.   

1295
01:14:21,591 --> 01:14:23,591
      I'd say Charles has       
      more to account for       

1296
01:14:23,593 --> 01:14:25,827
      in that department.       

1297
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:31,666
    - So, both your dad and     
     Charles' dad are dead?     

1298
01:14:31,668 --> 01:14:33,034
          - Yes, sir.           

1299
01:14:33,036 --> 01:14:34,302
- [Homer] Heart attack for one, 

1300
01:14:34,304 --> 01:14:37,004
       drunk driving for        
       the other, tragic.       

1301
01:14:38,842 --> 01:14:40,174
         - It happens.          

1302
01:14:40,176 --> 01:14:41,976
       - [Homer] It does.       

1303
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:44,745
Doesn't make it any less tragic.

1304
01:14:44,747 --> 01:14:46,380
             Right?             

1305
01:14:47,283 --> 01:14:48,549
            - Right.            

1306
01:14:48,551 --> 01:14:50,017
             Yeah.              

1307
01:14:56,759 --> 01:14:59,794
         - Nice place.          

1308
01:14:59,796 --> 01:15:02,296
       Good use of space.       

1309
01:15:02,298 --> 01:15:03,531
          - Thank you.          

1310
01:15:03,533 --> 01:15:05,633
    - What do you call this     
     style of architecture?     

1311
01:15:05,635 --> 01:15:08,536
   - Oh, I don't really know.   

1312
01:15:08,538 --> 01:15:10,972
    I guess it would be a--     

1313
01:15:10,974 --> 01:15:13,040
         I don't know.          

1314
01:15:20,650 --> 01:15:25,720
   (eerie suspenseful music)    

1315
01:15:29,325 --> 01:15:30,791
 - So, where were you the night 

1316
01:15:30,793 --> 01:15:34,161
Genevieve Du Bois died, Thomas? 

1317
01:15:38,501 --> 01:15:40,334
             - Um.              

1318
01:15:40,336 --> 01:15:41,736
   What night was that again?   

1319
01:15:41,738 --> 01:15:43,437
       - Two nights ago.        

1320
01:15:46,175 --> 01:15:48,809
    - Oh, gee, let me think.    

1321
01:15:53,016 --> 01:15:57,084
     No, I can't remember.      

1322
01:15:57,086 --> 01:15:59,053
      - You know who I am.      

1323
01:15:59,923 --> 01:16:02,056
       - I looked you up.       

1324
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:03,991
     - I figured you would.     

1325
01:16:03,993 --> 01:16:07,261
        So you know what        
        I can do, right?        

1326
01:16:08,364 --> 01:16:12,166
 You're not stupid, Mr. 160 IQ. 

1327
01:16:12,168 --> 01:16:14,835
       Best to be honest        
       with me, alright?        

1328
01:16:14,837 --> 01:16:19,674
         (eerie music)          

1329
01:16:19,676 --> 01:16:21,909
      - I know about the--      

1330
01:16:26,649 --> 01:16:28,616
    Charles took it, not me.    

1331
01:16:30,787 --> 01:16:32,853
      - I've got you, pal.      

1332
01:16:32,855 --> 01:16:35,723
     (eerie haunting music)     

1333
01:16:35,725 --> 01:16:37,792
      Let's make it easy.       

1334
01:16:37,794 --> 01:16:39,827
           (gun shot)           

1335
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:42,897
           (groaning)           

1336
01:16:42,899 --> 01:16:45,199
             Shit!              

1337
01:16:45,201 --> 01:16:47,902
 I should've seen that coming.  

1338
01:16:50,139 --> 01:16:51,772
           - Mother?            

1339
01:16:51,774 --> 01:16:54,909
     - He talked too much.      

1340
01:16:56,112 --> 01:16:59,113
    - Mother, are you okay?     

1341
01:16:59,115 --> 01:16:59,780
            Come on.            

1342
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:01,248
          You're okay.          

1343
01:17:02,285 --> 01:17:03,250
        Here's the bed.         

1344
01:17:03,252 --> 01:17:04,418
            Hop up.             

1345
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:06,020
             Okay.              
             Okay.              

1346
01:17:06,022 --> 01:17:08,289
           (moaning)            

1347
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:10,057
         Here you are.          

1348
01:17:10,059 --> 01:17:11,892
    Can I get you anything.     

1349
01:17:12,862 --> 01:17:14,061
          - I'm fine.           

1350
01:17:14,063 --> 01:17:16,697
     - If there's anything,     
        I'd be happy to.        

1351
01:17:16,699 --> 01:17:18,666
        - No, I'm fine.         

1352
01:17:18,668 --> 01:17:21,002
 - I just, I feel like I should 
    probably explain a few--    

1353
01:17:21,004 --> 01:17:24,171
      - Just send Charles       
      in when he arrives.       

1354
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:36,550
     - Why do you hate me?      

1355
01:17:38,554 --> 01:17:40,721
 With every word you say to me, 

1356
01:17:40,723 --> 01:17:42,456
        you spit poison.        

1357
01:17:42,458 --> 01:17:45,159
   You hate my fucking guts.    

1358
01:17:45,161 --> 01:17:47,628
      - Thomas, language!       

1359
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:50,631
       - I try to be the        
       good son for you,        

1360
01:17:50,633 --> 01:17:53,034
  but you always want Charles.  

1361
01:17:53,036 --> 01:17:54,702
          Why is that?          

1362
01:17:59,876 --> 01:18:01,375
           - Alright.           

1363
01:18:03,746 --> 01:18:05,513
            Alright.            

1364
01:18:05,515 --> 01:18:09,050
   Could you get mumsie some    
    of her medicine, please?    

1365
01:18:10,987 --> 01:18:12,853
      - Of course, mother.      

1366
01:18:17,427 --> 01:18:19,026
            Mother--            

1367
01:18:20,363 --> 01:18:21,729
            Can I--             

1368
01:18:24,867 --> 01:18:28,135
       Can we talk about        
      what just happened?       

1369
01:18:29,138 --> 01:18:31,572
 - Best to forget it, I think.  

1370
01:18:32,842 --> 01:18:34,608
       - There's a police       
   officer bleeding to death    

1371
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:35,743
      in our living room,       

1372
01:18:35,745 --> 01:18:38,412
    we can't just forget it.    

1373
01:18:41,117 --> 01:18:43,951
     The thing is, mother,      

1374
01:18:47,757 --> 01:18:50,057
         Charles and I,         

1375
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:55,162
              We--              

1376
01:18:55,164 --> 01:18:56,931
        killed someone.         

1377
01:19:00,269 --> 01:19:01,135
           - I know.            

1378
01:19:01,137 --> 01:19:02,703
          - You what?           

1379
01:19:04,307 --> 01:19:06,340
      - It's called guilt,      
         you big pussy.         

1380
01:19:06,342 --> 01:19:08,442
  That's what you're feeling.   

1381
01:19:08,444 --> 01:19:11,178
       And you wonder why       
        I favor Charles.        

1382
01:19:13,116 --> 01:19:14,515
         - He told you.         

1383
01:19:14,517 --> 01:19:17,485
     Charles, he told you?      

1384
01:19:17,487 --> 01:19:19,520
    - Of course he told me.     

1385
01:19:19,522 --> 01:19:21,922
         He told me the         
       night it happened.       

1386
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:23,324
         Especially how         
       you started acting       

1387
01:19:23,326 --> 01:19:26,026
         like a colicky         
     little baby about it.      

1388
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:30,464
        You're just like        
      your mewling father.      

1389
01:19:30,466 --> 01:19:32,333
            Useless.            

1390
01:19:33,503 --> 01:19:36,103
       If I hadn't killed       
        him when I did,         

1391
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:38,572
    he would've impregnated     

1392
01:19:38,574 --> 01:19:41,408
     that stupid secretary      
        of his for sure,        

1393
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:44,011
     spreading more of his      
      garbage seed around.      

1394
01:19:44,013 --> 01:19:45,579
 - What are you saying, mother? 

1395
01:19:45,581 --> 01:19:48,182
   - Your father was a drunk.   

1396
01:19:49,585 --> 01:19:51,619
      It was easy to fake.      

1397
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:55,756
      And Charles' father       
      was a genius, but--       

1398
01:19:55,758 --> 01:19:59,527
        He couldn't fuck        
       to save his life.        

1399
01:20:00,496 --> 01:20:01,629
          - Oh my God.          

1400
01:20:01,631 --> 01:20:03,564
  - Do you know how easy it is  

1401
01:20:03,566 --> 01:20:07,334
to fake a heart attack, Thomas? 

1402
01:20:07,336 --> 01:20:09,503
  You could even pull it off.   

1403
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:13,440
           - Mother?            

1404
01:20:13,442 --> 01:20:14,341
              Why?              

1405
01:20:14,343 --> 01:20:16,110
           - Because.           

1406
01:20:16,112 --> 01:20:19,880
They weren't worthy, that's why.

1407
01:20:25,955 --> 01:20:28,489
     I know the two of you      

1408
01:20:28,491 --> 01:20:32,526
   have been paying attention   
     to me over the years.      

1409
01:20:32,528 --> 01:20:34,829
          But somehow,          

1410
01:20:34,831 --> 01:20:38,766
       somehow I knew I'd       
       go wrong with you.       

1411
01:20:38,768 --> 01:20:41,001
   You had garbage genetics.    

1412
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:43,771
     You've been my canker      
        sore ever since.        

1413
01:20:43,773 --> 01:20:46,040
            (crying)            

1414
01:20:46,042 --> 01:20:47,875
        - Jesus Christ.         

1415
01:20:47,877 --> 01:20:50,377
       - Oh, look at you.       

1416
01:20:50,379 --> 01:20:53,647
        Acting like one         
       of them even now.        

1417
01:20:55,551 --> 01:20:57,918
       You may have come        
        out of my cunt,         

1418
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:00,487
    but you came out wrong.     

1419
01:21:04,861 --> 01:21:07,795
    - You killed my father?     

1420
01:21:09,832 --> 01:21:11,799
  - And I was happy to do it.   

1421
01:21:11,801 --> 01:21:14,668
       - But he loved me.       

1422
01:21:15,838 --> 01:21:17,671
       - Love isn't real.       

1423
01:21:18,908 --> 01:21:22,176
  Respect and fear, that's it.  

1424
01:21:22,178 --> 01:21:25,446
      Charles respects me       
      because he fears me.      

1425
01:21:26,515 --> 01:21:28,582
           But you--            

1426
01:21:28,584 --> 01:21:30,951
       You're different.        

1427
01:21:30,953 --> 01:21:33,187
   You're weak and powerless    

1428
01:21:33,189 --> 01:21:36,790
       and you yearn for        
    things that don't exist.    

1429
01:21:36,792 --> 01:21:40,494
       You may have acted       
     like Mr. Big and Bad,      

1430
01:21:40,496 --> 01:21:42,329
but when the world opened up and

1431
01:21:42,331 --> 01:21:44,164
     showed itself to you,      

1432
01:21:44,166 --> 01:21:46,734
   you shit your pants or ran   
    away like a little baby.    

1433
01:21:46,736 --> 01:21:49,470
          (sniffling)           

1434
01:21:49,472 --> 01:21:52,606
      You should just kill      
 yourself and be done with it.  

1435
01:21:52,608 --> 01:21:54,775
     Save us the trouble of     
    having to deal with you.    

1436
01:21:54,777 --> 01:21:59,813
   (eerie suspenseful music)    

1437
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:05,819
            Oh good.            

1438
01:22:05,821 --> 01:22:07,554
  Shoot yourself in the head.   

1439
01:22:07,556 --> 01:22:09,556
       Pull a Hemingway.        

1440
01:22:09,558 --> 01:22:12,159
         Smartest thing         
       you could ever do.       

1441
01:22:13,529 --> 01:22:17,831
   I've been pushing Charles    
     for years to kill you,     

1442
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:20,000
     but he wouldn't do it.     

1443
01:22:20,002 --> 01:22:22,169
          Damn idiot.           

1444
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:27,908
    I should've aborted you     
     when I had the chance.     

1445
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:29,109
           (laughing)           

1446
01:22:29,111 --> 01:22:31,745
        Really, Thomas?         

1447
01:22:34,583 --> 01:22:37,017
   You don't have the balls.    

1448
01:22:43,592 --> 01:22:46,894
   - You can't run away from    
     what you did, mother.      

1449
01:22:48,698 --> 01:22:53,767
   (talking on movie screen)    

1450
01:22:59,909 --> 01:23:01,475
        - Hey, fat guy.         

1451
01:23:01,477 --> 01:23:03,944
           (pounding)           

1452
01:23:05,982 --> 01:23:07,815
           Hold this.           

1453
01:23:12,221 --> 01:23:14,054
           Thank you.           

1454
01:23:19,729 --> 01:23:24,698
         (pounding and          
     dramatic horror music)     

1455
01:24:20,790 --> 01:24:25,826
         (eerie music)          

1456
01:24:34,703 --> 01:24:39,773
           (applause)           

1457
01:24:47,316 --> 01:24:48,949
          You like me.          

1458
01:24:49,785 --> 01:24:52,820
      You really like me.       

1459
01:24:52,822 --> 01:24:56,957
           (applause)           

1460
01:24:56,959 --> 01:24:59,827
   I want to thank my mother,   

1461
01:24:59,829 --> 01:25:01,895
          and Thomas,           

1462
01:25:02,765 --> 01:25:05,199
        and most of all,        

1463
01:25:05,201 --> 01:25:07,601
      I want to thank God.      

1464
01:25:07,603 --> 01:25:08,902
           Thank you.           

1465
01:25:08,904 --> 01:25:10,737
           Thank you.           

1466
01:25:10,739 --> 01:25:15,809
    (applause and cheering)     

1467
01:25:17,813 --> 01:25:19,813
           Goodnight!           

1468
01:25:19,815 --> 01:25:24,818
           (humming)            

1469
01:25:30,759 --> 01:25:32,926
       - Where were you?        

1470
01:25:36,031 --> 01:25:38,599
         - Where was I?         

1471
01:25:38,601 --> 01:25:41,435
    (dramatic horror music)     

1472
01:25:41,437 --> 01:25:43,137
           Oh, yeah.            

1473
01:25:44,306 --> 01:25:48,876
 I was turning water into wine. 

1474
01:25:53,716 --> 01:25:56,783
  - You're really the king of   
the fucking idiots, aren't you? 

1475
01:25:56,785 --> 01:25:58,085
           (giggling)           

1476
01:25:58,087 --> 01:26:01,355
  - It's nice to see you too.   

1477
01:26:04,994 --> 01:26:06,360
        - You framed it?        

1478
01:26:06,362 --> 01:26:07,594
            - Yeah.             

1479
01:26:07,596 --> 01:26:10,130
      I had to go to three      
     separate craft stores      

1480
01:26:10,132 --> 01:26:12,733
just to find the right size too.

1481
01:26:12,735 --> 01:26:15,202
     - And you told mother.     

1482
01:26:15,204 --> 01:26:17,871
What the hell were you thinking?

1483
01:26:22,011 --> 01:26:24,511
       - What did you do?       

1484
01:26:27,650 --> 01:26:28,815
            Mother?             

1485
01:26:30,019 --> 01:26:31,285
            Mother?             

1486
01:26:32,488 --> 01:26:33,820
            Mother?             

1487
01:26:40,095 --> 01:26:41,328
             Mommy?             

1488
01:26:43,732 --> 01:26:45,165
             Mommy?             

1489
01:26:46,602 --> 01:26:47,501
             Mommy?             

1490
01:26:47,503 --> 01:26:48,735
              No.               

1491
01:26:48,737 --> 01:26:50,837
        No, no, no, no.         

1492
01:26:50,839 --> 01:26:52,773
           (sobbing)            

1493
01:26:52,775 --> 01:26:54,775
        What did you do?        

1494
01:26:54,777 --> 01:26:57,878
           (gunshots)           

1495
01:27:04,119 --> 01:27:07,821
            (crying)            

1496
01:27:07,823 --> 01:27:11,692
  You didn't have to kill her.  

1497
01:27:11,694 --> 01:27:15,195
        - Don't you see         
      what she did to us?       

1498
01:27:15,197 --> 01:27:18,398
We're like this because of her. 

1499
01:27:20,169 --> 01:27:21,535
          - Like what?          

1500
01:27:21,537 --> 01:27:22,603
         - Delusional.          

1501
01:27:22,605 --> 01:27:24,037
             Crazy.             

1502
01:27:29,678 --> 01:27:33,747
      (suspenseful music)       

1503
01:27:33,749 --> 01:27:34,881
             - I'm              

1504
01:27:37,119 --> 01:27:38,719
             crazy.             

1505
01:27:38,721 --> 01:27:41,154
 (dramatic music and fighting)  

1506
01:27:41,156 --> 01:27:43,690
       She wasn't crazy.        

1507
01:27:43,692 --> 01:27:46,260
         You're crazy!          

1508
01:27:46,262 --> 01:27:48,762
         You're crazy!          

1509
01:27:48,764 --> 01:27:51,932
     You're the crazy one!      

1510
01:27:59,141 --> 01:28:01,141
     - What happened to us?     

1511
01:28:01,944 --> 01:28:03,710
 What the hell happened to us?  

1512
01:28:03,712 --> 01:28:05,946
         - Everything!          

1513
01:28:05,948 --> 01:28:09,316
      Everything happened       
         to us, Thomas!         

1514
01:28:09,318 --> 01:28:12,185
     We were made for this!     

1515
01:28:12,187 --> 01:28:14,488
     Because we're smarter.     

1516
01:28:14,490 --> 01:28:16,990
         We're better.          

1517
01:28:16,992 --> 01:28:20,994
     All this other garbage     
   and conventional thinking,   

1518
01:28:22,264 --> 01:28:24,331
       we're beyond that.       

1519
01:28:25,634 --> 01:28:26,967
       We have the look.        

1520
01:28:26,969 --> 01:28:27,901
          - What look?          

1521
01:28:27,903 --> 01:28:29,936
       - I have the look!       

1522
01:28:31,006 --> 01:28:33,006
     Jeffrey Dahmer had it.     

1523
01:28:33,008 --> 01:28:34,875
       Ted Bundy had it.        

1524
01:28:34,877 --> 01:28:38,045
       And now, I do too.       

1525
01:28:38,047 --> 01:28:42,482
    The look of a confident     
     and untouchable being.     

1526
01:28:43,552 --> 01:28:46,653
      We've touched hands       
    with the divine, Thomas.    

1527
01:28:46,655 --> 01:28:48,789
            Our eyes            

1528
01:28:49,925 --> 01:28:52,225
        have been opened        

1529
01:28:52,227 --> 01:28:54,094
            by God.             

1530
01:28:54,096 --> 01:28:55,796
        - We were wrong.        

1531
01:28:57,566 --> 01:29:00,500
   We were so fucking wrong.    

1532
01:29:03,906 --> 01:29:06,940
     - There is no regret.      

1533
01:29:09,645 --> 01:29:11,378
          Not for us.           

1534
01:29:12,481 --> 01:29:15,615
          Not anymore.          

1535
01:29:15,617 --> 01:29:18,218
       Once you're born,        

1536
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:20,954
       you can't go back.       

1537
01:29:20,956 --> 01:29:22,489
 - Stop talking, you're crazy.  

1538
01:29:22,491 --> 01:29:24,491
     You don't get to talk.     

1539
01:29:25,694 --> 01:29:30,697
    (dramatic horror music)     

1540
01:29:30,699 --> 01:29:32,766
     - Where are you going?     

1541
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:37,270
(fighting and suspenseful music)

1542
01:29:37,272 --> 01:29:38,672
      - Get off, Charles.       

1543
01:29:38,674 --> 01:29:43,744
   (struggling and fighting)    

1544
01:29:49,752 --> 01:29:53,553
    - You're telling on us?     

1545
01:29:53,555 --> 01:29:54,788
              Huh?              

1546
01:29:54,790 --> 01:29:56,623
       You're gonna tell        
      on us like a little       

1547
01:29:56,625 --> 01:29:59,860
    snot-nosed tattle tale?     

1548
01:29:59,862 --> 01:30:00,660
              Huh?              

1549
01:30:00,662 --> 01:30:05,065
    You big mongoloid baby.     

1550
01:30:05,067 --> 01:30:09,703
  I swear to God, I could just  
  kill you right now, Thomas.   

1551
01:30:09,705 --> 01:30:13,306
   (screaming and dial tone)    

1552
01:30:13,308 --> 01:30:14,775
            Thomas!             

1553
01:30:24,653 --> 01:30:27,821
        - [Thomas] Let's        
       turn ourselves in.       

1554
01:30:29,258 --> 01:30:31,458
      - Stop this, Thomas.      

1555
01:30:32,594 --> 01:30:33,927
 We can bury mother and go back 

1556
01:30:33,929 --> 01:30:35,962
    to the way things were.     

1557
01:30:36,799 --> 01:30:39,332
     Nothing has to change.     

1558
01:30:39,334 --> 01:30:42,068
      - We can't run away       
       from what we did.        

1559
01:30:46,141 --> 01:30:49,543
 They're waiting for our call.  

1560
01:30:49,545 --> 01:30:51,077
            - Don't.            

1561
01:30:51,079 --> 01:30:53,280
        - We can ask for        
        a cell together.        

1562
01:30:53,282 --> 01:30:54,614
         They should be         
       able to grant that       

1563
01:30:54,616 --> 01:30:56,249
        if we cooperate.        

1564
01:30:58,253 --> 01:31:01,421
       - [Charles] Don't        
       call them, Thomas.       

1565
01:31:01,423 --> 01:31:03,323
 - It'll be okay, baby brother. 

1566
01:31:05,761 --> 01:31:08,895
 - Thomas, put the phone down.  

1567
01:31:08,897 --> 01:31:12,032
   - They said they'd go easy   
     on us if we confessed.     

1568
01:31:12,034 --> 01:31:14,901
   Everybody makes mistakes.    

1569
01:31:16,071 --> 01:31:20,407
       - Thomas, put down       
       the fucking phone.       

1570
01:31:20,409 --> 01:31:22,142
      - Language, Charles.      

1571
01:31:23,912 --> 01:31:25,245
           (gun shot)           

1572
01:31:31,487 --> 01:31:33,887
            - Tommy?            

1573
01:31:33,889 --> 01:31:35,489
            Oh shit.            

1574
01:31:35,491 --> 01:31:37,023
            Oh shit.            

1575
01:31:37,926 --> 01:31:39,493
            Thomas?             

1576
01:31:43,265 --> 01:31:45,499
           Oh my God.           

1577
01:31:45,501 --> 01:31:46,700
             Tommy?             

1578
01:31:47,703 --> 01:31:51,738
      (crying and whimper)      

1579
01:31:51,740 --> 01:31:53,807
         Are you okay?          

1580
01:31:56,378 --> 01:32:00,914
       - I could use some       
   sunshine right about now.    

1581
01:32:02,985 --> 01:32:04,718
            - Okay.             

1582
01:32:05,687 --> 01:32:07,087
             Okay.              

1583
01:32:10,759 --> 01:32:15,262
        Sunshine, baby        

1584
01:32:15,264 --> 01:32:18,298
        It's sunshine         

1585
01:32:20,269 --> 01:32:24,304
    Time to wake up, baby     

1586
01:32:24,306 --> 01:32:28,909
    Open those                 
pretty little eyes             

1587
01:32:30,112 --> 01:32:34,848
   Oh, it's sunshine, baby    

1588
01:32:37,052 --> 01:32:40,353
    All for you, sunshine 떰   

1589
01:32:40,355 --> 01:32:45,358
            (crying)            

1590
01:32:46,562 --> 01:32:48,428
      - I love that song.       

1591
01:32:48,430 --> 01:32:53,433
            (crying)            

1592
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:03,009
            - What?             

1593
01:33:03,011 --> 01:33:05,211
     - It's okay, Charlie.      

1594
01:33:07,049 --> 01:33:08,982
         I can see her.         

1595
01:33:11,119 --> 01:33:12,752
           - See who?           

1596
01:33:13,589 --> 01:33:15,689
          - Genevieve.          

1597
01:33:17,526 --> 01:33:18,858
          She's there.          

1598
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:20,493
         I can see her.         

1599
01:33:28,971 --> 01:33:32,005
   She says she forgives me.    

1600
01:33:37,746 --> 01:33:42,816
            (crying)            

1601
01:33:46,722 --> 01:33:48,488
            - Tommy?            

1602
01:33:50,692 --> 01:33:52,692
             Tommy?             

1603
01:33:54,696 --> 01:33:55,895
           Oh my God.           

1604
01:33:55,897 --> 01:33:58,965
            (crying)            

1605
01:34:01,603 --> 01:34:02,569
             Tommy!             

1606
01:34:02,571 --> 01:34:07,273
           (sobbing)            

1607
01:34:08,410 --> 01:34:10,276
         I'm so sorry.          

1608
01:34:10,278 --> 01:34:14,514
            (crying)            

1609
01:34:14,516 --> 01:34:18,618
     I don't know what the      
     fuck is wrong with me.     

1610
01:34:18,620 --> 01:34:21,955
           (sobbing)            

1611
01:34:21,957 --> 01:34:24,024
   I love you so much, Tommy.   

1612
01:34:24,026 --> 01:34:25,625
        Please don't go.        

1613
01:34:25,627 --> 01:34:27,360
        Please don't go.        

1614
01:34:27,362 --> 01:34:29,529
       - Sorry, Charles.        

1615
01:34:29,531 --> 01:34:34,601
           (sobbing)            

1616
01:34:36,605 --> 01:34:38,371
            Goodbye.            

1617
01:34:38,373 --> 01:34:43,243
     (soft acoustic music)      

1618
01:34:47,749 --> 01:34:52,819
        (police sirens)         

1619
01:34:53,221 --> 01:34:54,721
            - Fuck!             

1620
01:34:54,723 --> 01:34:59,392
  (heavy breathing and sirens)  

1621
01:35:00,362 --> 01:35:02,228
          (heavy rain)          

1622
01:35:02,230 --> 01:35:07,167
        This ordeal will       
        seal your fate         

1623
01:35:07,169 --> 01:35:12,238
     (soft acoustic music)      

1624
01:35:47,809 --> 01:35:49,542
       - It's over, pal.        

1625
01:35:49,544 --> 01:35:52,779
       You can come back        
        to reality now.         

1626
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:59,819
       After the storm        

1627
01:35:59,821 --> 01:36:02,689
       You'll transform       

1628
