1
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:47,381
Take little jobs
Just to get by

2
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,249
Kids are dying
On the corner

3
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:51,251
Just trying to be fly

4
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:55,055
Everybody on the ave
Wants to be a star

5
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:59,459
Big coats and diamonds
With fancy cars

6
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,263
Everything that glitters
Is gold, is gold

7
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:07,201
Everything that glitters
Is gold, is gold

8
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:11,205
Everything that glitters
Is gold, is gold

9
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:15,108
Everything that glitters
Is gold, is gold

10
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,787
Money is the root
Of all evil

11
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:29,056
It's hard time
Through the crime

12
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,891
With the paper dough

13
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:33,794
Stop it and let go of my bag!

14
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:35,729
Leave her bag alone.
You guys are so stupid.

15
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:37,598
-Anyway,
-Hey, man.

16
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,032
Like I was saying,
when I get older,

17
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,100
I'm gonna marry Prince.

18
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:41,802
I'm gonna marry
Michael Jackson.

19
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,437
-No, you're not.
-Zenobia,

20
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,939
you need to be thinking about
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar

21
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,074
or Darryl Dawkins.

22
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:48,775
Yeah, you definitely
need a giant.

23
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:50,077
That ain't funny, Phil.

24
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:51,144
Why am I laughing?

25
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:53,580
Y'all need to shut up
and let go of my bag.

26
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,617
Ow! That hurt!

27
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,919
You know, if you weren't a girl,
I would--

28
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:00,087
You wouldn't do a thing.

29
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:01,822
Z, you need to pick on
somebody your own size.

30
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:05,125
Zen, Zenobia, get back here

31
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,593
and leave
those stupid boys alone.

32
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,794
Let's get her.

33
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,663
One day, I'm gonna beat them up.

34
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:11,265
-You always say that.
-I'm gonna get you.

35
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,634
-I'm tired of all the teasing.
-Quit it.

36
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,435
I can't help it. I'm tall.

37
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,971
I wish I was tall like you
because when I get older,

38
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,340
I would be a model.
You know, models are real tall.

39
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:23,977
I'm not pretty.

40
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:25,779
Yes, you are.

41
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:27,181
You're prettier than me.

42
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:29,516
You're just saying that
because we're best friends.

43
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:31,385
No, I'm not.

44
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,854
Michael Jackson
will never marry me.

45
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:36,023
Prince will never marry me,
so we even.

46
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,659
-You know what?
-What?

47
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,694
When we get older, we're both
gonna get married,

48
00:02:40,794 --> 00:02:42,396
have a bunch of kids,

49
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,964
and we're gonna live
next door to each other.

50
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,300
Yeah, and our daughters
can be best friends like us.

51
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:48,969
And our husbands
can be best friends.

52
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,804
Girl, you tripping.

53
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:53,006
Shut up, boy, and bring me
back my book!

54
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,175
Cleavon. Cleavon!

55
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,010
Cleavon!

56
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,379
Phil, over here.

57
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,381
-What took y'all so long?
-I had to go, girl.

58
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:02,649
You always have to go.

59
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:04,218
Whew. Whatever, dude.

60
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,887
-Happy birthday, Zen!
-Ah!

61
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:08,589
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
happy birthday.

62
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,857
-Hi, baby.
-Mwah.

63
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:10,958
How did you get out
the house tonight?

64
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,061
What, I bought my house.
I come and go as I please.

65
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:15,762
Yeah. Right. No, you don't.

66
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,766
-Coco watching the kids?
-Uh, no, they're at my mom's.

67
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,735
-Mm.
-Oh, where's Coco?

68
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:23,770
She's out with friends.

69
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:25,172
-Oh.
-Okay.

70
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,007
-Hm.
-Yeah.

71
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:29,877
Hm, did you invite her
to come party with us?

72
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:32,379
Oh, well, she had these plans
for a while, you know,

73
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:34,748
planned, so you know
what I'm saying.

74
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:36,917
Phil, why do you always
let her do you like that?

75
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,418
Like what?

76
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,555
You're kidding me, right?

77
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:43,790
-Guys...
-What is this?

78
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,927
Hey, actually, you know what?
Uh, Phil, "this" is an adjective

79
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,161
that's used to
describe something.

80
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,696
You didn't really
describe anything.

81
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:53,734
No it's not. "This" is a pronoun
that activates a verb.

82
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,802
What? No. It's not.
You're wrong.

83
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:58,739
"This" is an adjective that's
used to accentuate a noun,

84
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:02,009
or it can be used as an adverb
or some modifier, okay? Yes.

85
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,477
-Okay, you guys, hold up.
-A sub-modifier?

86
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,712
-A sub-modifier.
-Okay, hold up, you guys.

87
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:07,915
You guys, Phil, you know
what I'm talking about.

88
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,951
No, Vic. What exactly
are you talking about?

89
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,991
You know this is not the time
nor the place, so...

90
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:20,060
Mm. [clears throat]
Where's your husband?

91
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,230
I'm sorry I even
brought this up.

92
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:24,398
Real quick, can I say
something to you?

93
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:25,966
Did you see how she used
the word "this"?

94
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,267
As an adjective.

95
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,802
-It's a pronoun.
-It's an adjective!

96
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:30,137
-A pronoun!
-Will you shut up?

97
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,439
Shut up, please. Thank you.

98
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:36,944
Where's Austin, Vic?

99
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,112
Can't we just get back
to celebrating?

100
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:40,214
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

101
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,582
-Hello, this is my birthday.
-You always drop these bombs,

102
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:42,649
and you walk away
from the carnage,

103
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:45,219
leaving everybody else wounded,
so where's Austin?

104
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,988
Yeah, guys, this is
my birthday party, okay?

105
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:50,457
-I'm gonna have fun.
-Hey, what'd you just say?

106
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,792
What'd you just say, Zen?

107
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:55,028
"This is my birthday party,"
adjective.

108
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,697
-Pronoun.
-It's an adjective!

109
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,398
-It's a pronoun!
-Shut up, please.

110
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,934
Come here. Can I speak to you
for a second, please?

111
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,269
I got nothing else to say
about it.

112
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:03,637
Can't we just celebrate?

113
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:05,772
I got a sweet spot
Straight for the lips

114
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,174
I've got to take you back
To the club

115
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:08,275
You know, I'm getting really
sick of you

116
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:09,776
talking negative about Coco.

117
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:13,680
Look, I apologize for bringing
it up in front of everybody, but

118
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,316
-we can all see...
-I gotta to the bathroom.

119
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,051
All right. Okay.
So I need to go.

120
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,686
Fine, I'll hold it.
I'll hold it.

121
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,890
You know, everybody's marriage
is different, okay?

122
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,991
Living it large

123
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:26,059
I mean, how long you and Austin
been together, two years?

124
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,861
No. We've been together
for three years.

125
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,297
Okay, three years,
is everything perfect?

126
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:31,632
Of course not.

127
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,501
You know, I love her.
She loves me.

128
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:36,136
She's a good wife
and a good mother.

129
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,906
I don't always need you and Zen
looking down your nose at her.

130
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:43,377
You're right.

131
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,381
I am sorry.
Do you accept my apology?

132
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:53,453
Yeah, of course I do.

133
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,157
Thank you, and I promise
I'll stay out your business.

134
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:00,227
-It's just that we all love you.
-I know.

135
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,829
-I know.
-Okay.

136
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:04,831
I got a sweet spot
Straight for the lips

137
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:05,899
Give me a hug.

138
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:08,368
Shorty, shake what your mama
Gave you

139
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:10,737
-Excuse me a second. All right?
-All right.

140
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:13,207
Shorty, shake what your mama
Gave you, uh-huh

141
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:17,578
That's right, shorty,
Shake what your mama gave you

142
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:18,679
Uh-huh

143
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,415
-Who's that girl?
-Who?

144
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:23,217
The girl right there.

145
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,252
-The girl right there?
-Wait, don't point.

146
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:26,553
-Put your hand down.
-Ow!

147
00:06:26,653 --> 00:06:28,088
-Why would you do that?
-Damn, Zen.

148
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,857
Why don't you go over there
and ask her her name?

149
00:06:30,324 --> 00:06:31,792
I can't do that.
You know I'm shy.

150
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,328
Shy? Boy, you about to be
36 years old.

151
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,495
Get off your ass and go...

152
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,331
Never mind. Excuse me!

153
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,599
-What are you doing?
-Hi!

154
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,535
-Oh, this is embarrassing.
-It's embarrassing?

155
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:43,370
-Yeah. Zen!
-Hi! Yeah, you...

156
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:44,805
Can you come over here
for a second?

157
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,941
Oh, okay, here she comes.
Get up. Get up. Get up.

158
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,676
-Here she comes.
-You drank too much.

159
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,613
Stand up. Here she comes.
Stand up. Stand up. Stand up.

160
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:54,114
-Stand up. Stand up.
-It's my birthday!

161
00:06:54,214 --> 00:06:55,716
-Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.
-Why?

162
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,217
Sit down because
you're taller than me!

163
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:58,852
Tell me what to say.
What do I say?

164
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,454
You ask her her name,
tell her she's pretty

165
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:02,222
and don't tell her
you're unemployed.

166
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:03,290
Okay, I wouldn't say that
because I'm not unemployed.

167
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,391
-I got a job.
-No.

168
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,459
-You know I got a job.
-No. You don't have a job.

169
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:06,894
-Yes, I do have a job.
-No, you don't.

170
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,128
-Shh, shh, here she comes.
-All right. Look normal.

171
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:09,530
-Here she comes. Look normal.
-Hey!

172
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,597
Hey, girl.

173
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:12,299
Uh, I saw you come in
with my friend Shavelle.

174
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,867
Oh, you're the birthday girl!

175
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,536
-Yeah. Hi, Zenobia.
-Nice to meet you.

176
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,104
Nice to meet you.
This is my friend Cleavon.

177
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:18,906
He's a little shy. He's been
that way his whole life.

178
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,141
-Nice to meet you.
-Yeah. Hey.

179
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:23,710
-She's, uh, she's just playing.
-No. I'm not.

180
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,312
-She's playing.
-No. I'm not.

181
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,716
Uh, so,

182
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,819
[stutters ] I'm Cleave,

183
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,422
Cleavon. Cleavon, yes.

184
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:36,490
Uh, it's a pleasure.

185
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,259
It's a pleasure
to meet you, too.

186
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:40,661
It's a pleasure to meet you,
as well.

187
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:43,297
Yeah, she, uh, she had a few.

188
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,099
Yeah. Okay.

189
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:47,467
Mmh-hmm.

190
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,671
I see you like to party

191
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:55,042
So it's, um, it's a nice club.

192
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:59,046
Yeah, oh, yeah, uh, it is, yep.

193
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:00,647
I see you like to party

194
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:01,748
Yeah.

195
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:04,384
So you come here often?

196
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,788
Uh, no, nope, no.

197
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:10,123
No, never been, nope.

198
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,191
Nope.

199
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:13,393
[smacks lips]

200
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:15,963
Well, it was very nice
to meet you.

201
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,031
-Yeah!
-So I'll see you.

202
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:19,466
Wait, uh, wait, excuse me.

203
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,669
[stutters] You got a second?

204
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:26,240
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah? Uh, yeah, you know,

205
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,141
I probably do get
a little nervous

206
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:31,678
when I'm around, like,
beautiful women and stuff.

207
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:34,248
-Oh.
-Finally a good line.

208
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,049
-Okay.
-You're killing me over here.

209
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,651
All right. Thank you,

210
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:38,986
-Hey, girl.
-Zen.

211
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,622
So, what do you do?

212
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,959
I am just finishing up
nursing school.

213
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,529
Okay, yeah, cool.

214
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,030
So what do you do?

215
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:51,565
-Hm?
-What do you do?

216
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,066
My... Oh, my job.

217
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:56,203
I work at a bank,
work in, like, a bank.

218
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,238
-Like a teller or...
-No.

219
00:08:58,405 --> 00:08:59,406
Huh?

220
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,575
Yeah, teller, what?

221
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:03,844
Girl, no.

222
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:06,079
I do too much stuff
to be a teller.

223
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:09,716
I'm in charge of, like,
deposits, do all the deposits.

224
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,118
That's my,

225
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,853
that's my friend Victoria.

226
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:14,988
I, uh, I grew up with her, yeah.

227
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,056
She's a good friend of mine.

228
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,192
Oh, that's my friend Phil
right there.

229
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:19,259
-Hey, Phil.
-Hey.

230
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,427
This is, uh, Falinda.

231
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,029
-How you doing, Falinda?
-Yeah.

232
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:23,130
-Nice to meet you.
-That's Phil.

233
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,732
Good to meet you.
Listen, um, I gotta go, guys.

234
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:26,934
Why do you have to go?

235
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:28,669
Um, got to pick the kids
up tonight.

236
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,003
This is
the worst birthday ever.

237
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,738
Oh, you're not leaving
because of me, are you?

238
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:32,940
-Stop it, Vic.
-Okay.

239
00:09:33,307 --> 00:09:35,709
Look, why can't Coco
pick them up?

240
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:36,777
It's my birthday!

241
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:40,914
I'm out.

242
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,716
-Yeah, Coco is...
-What's wrong with him?

243
00:09:44,218 --> 00:09:46,220
That's Phil's wife.
He got to go pick them up.

244
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:49,323
-Hey, Z!
-Hey, Shavelle.

245
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:51,959
-Happy birthday, girl!
-Thank you.

246
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:54,094
When we gonna get
some more drinks?

247
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,264
You know what?
It's Jackie's birthday, too.

248
00:09:57,331 --> 00:09:58,732
-Who's Jackie?
-Jackie?

249
00:09:58,799 --> 00:09:59,800
I'm on the phone.

250
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:01,935
Ooh, ooh, ooh, what's that?
What's that?

251
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:04,805
Are you talking to me?

252
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,040
Come on, now. I'm looking you

253
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,509
right in your face, silly girl.

254
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,744
It's a pomegranate saketini,
okay?

255
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,212
Hey, and how you doing?

256
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,280
Oh, this is Victoria.

257
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:14,815
-Hey, Vicky.
-Hey, y'all.

258
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:18,051
She cute. Look here, y'all.
Let's go on upstairs. All right?

259
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,887
Come on, Fa. Come on, La.

260
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:21,088
Come on, Fa.

261
00:10:22,256 --> 00:10:23,624
You gonna drink that?

262
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:26,593
Yeah, I was going...

263
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:30,063
You can have it.

264
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,899
You was acting like you wasn't
gonna drink it.

265
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:37,971
Yeah, tell me what you want

266
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:41,341
Mh.
You should've drank that, mh.

267
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:43,644
Wait for me, girl!

268
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,947
Oh, my friends are... so, bye.

269
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:48,782
Yeah, no, I got it because
I got to do some stuff

270
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:50,017
-and a thing, too.
-Nice to meet you guys.

271
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:51,351
-All right!
-See you.

272
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:52,486
Okay.

273
00:10:53,554 --> 00:10:56,390
Hey, woo, yeah.

274
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,125
-Girlfriends.
-Mm.

275
00:10:58,192 --> 00:10:59,493
But did you get her number?

276
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:04,164
Damn it. No. You know,
I knew I forgot something.

277
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:06,166
I did. Wow.

278
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:07,968
Does she have a man?

279
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:11,305
Damn it.
I didn't even...

280
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:12,372
Well, how old is she?

281
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,141
-I gotta go pee.
-Again?

282
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,809
-I'm gonna go pee.
-Can I have your drink?

283
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:16,877
You can have it, girl.

284
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:23,283
Hey, babe, uh, I'm on my way
to pick up the kids at Mom's,

285
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,687
so if you get this message,
call me.

286
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:29,489
Love you.

287
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,559
Aw, that poor little honey.

288
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:35,362
He is never gonna find
anyone, ever.

289
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,364
-You feel bad for him?
-I do.

290
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:38,832
Well, you should feel bad for me

291
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,367
because I'm never
gonna find anyone.

292
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:44,505
Uh, okay, yes, you will,
Zenobia.

293
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:46,507
No. I'm not. Uh, look around.

294
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:51,044
This place is full of men and
absolutely no prospects for me.

295
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:53,146
I'm knocking on 40's door,
and-- [upbeat music starts]

296
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,416
-Do you hear that?
-Girl, yes, that's my song.

297
00:11:56,517 --> 00:11:58,519
-No. No. Not the song.
-Hey!

298
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:02,689
Do you hear the clock ticking?
Do you hear it?

299
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:06,393
-Okay, you are really...
-It's my biological clock.

300
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,196
It's ticking, Victoria,
and I just...

301
00:12:10,364 --> 00:12:12,032
-You're being silly.
-No. I'm not.

302
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:13,100
Yes, you are.

303
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,068
You know, I'm not trying to
have any kids at 40 years old.

304
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:16,570
I'll take my kids
to nursery school,

305
00:12:16,637 --> 00:12:18,438
and they're gonna say,
"Is that your grandmama?"

306
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:20,707
It's not cute!

307
00:12:21,642 --> 00:12:23,577
You need to stop
limiting yourself

308
00:12:23,644 --> 00:12:25,946
and kind of lower the bar
a little bit.

309
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:27,381
Psh, there is no bar.

310
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,883
You have set a very high
standard, my dear.

311
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,251
I'm laid out.

312
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,086
Excuse me.

313
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:35,189
Hello, ladies.

314
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:38,759
This is Nick West.

315
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:41,094
-Okay.
-Yes.

316
00:12:41,662 --> 00:12:43,197
-Hello.
-Hey, how you doing?

317
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,799
Hey, I just, uh, wanted to come
over and introduce myself

318
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,835
and, uh, meet your girl
here from TV.

319
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,004
You the one from TV, right,
Zenobia Cartwright, right?

320
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:53,073
-Hi.
-Hey.

321
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,542
You're Nick West
from "The Wolves", hey.

322
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,445
Aw, baby, in the flesh.
[laughter]

323
00:13:02,783 --> 00:13:06,753
Yeah, uh, so,

324
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,222
Yeah, I am.

325
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,023
-Oh.
-I'm with her.

326
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:12,392
-Oh, you with her?
-Yes.

327
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,262
Oh, as in with her?

328
00:13:15,696 --> 00:13:17,431
Well, yeah, she's my girlfriend.

329
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:22,269
Well, your girlfriend
as in your girlfriend?

330
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:24,638
You know what?
I got to make a call.

331
00:13:25,873 --> 00:13:27,307
Oh, you've gotta make a call.

332
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,710
Loud as it is up in here,
she got to make a call.

333
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,811
[laughter]

334
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:34,047
Yeah, no.

335
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:35,649
[cell phone rings]

336
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:38,652
Uh-huh.

337
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:40,721
Incoming. [laughter]

338
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:45,959
Yeah.

339
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:48,595
So, uh, what's your name here,
shorty, huh?

340
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:50,998
Mrs. Married.

341
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:54,168
Oh, well, you should have stayed

00:22:14,735 --> 00:22:16,436
I don't know she was pretty,
Phil?

513
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:18,038
I didn't see her?
Come on, man.

514
00:22:18,138 --> 00:22:20,274
I just told you I messed up.
I already know.

515
00:22:20,874 --> 00:22:22,009
Well, maybe you'll
see her again.

516
00:22:23,977 --> 00:22:26,680
I did some,
I'm just gonna tell you,

517
00:22:26,747 --> 00:22:27,881
and you tell me
how you feel about it.

518
00:22:27,981 --> 00:22:30,017
It could be, like,
semistalker-ish,

519
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:31,752
but I went and I, uh,

520
00:22:31,852 --> 00:22:33,320
I called every nursing school
in the county

521
00:22:33,987 --> 00:22:35,489
just to try to see
if she was enrolled in them,

522
00:22:35,556 --> 00:22:36,990
and I didn't come up
with nothing,

523
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:39,092
but now I'm scared that if she
does enroll, they gonna be like,

524
00:22:39,193 --> 00:22:40,727
"This guy called here,
like, seven times."

525
00:22:41,228 --> 00:22:42,930
Why didn't you
just Google her, bruh?

526
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,665
You know, Google her,
you just...

527
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:45,832
I don't know her last name.

528
00:22:46,066 --> 00:22:47,768
-Come on, man.
-Not good, bruh.

529
00:22:48,168 --> 00:22:50,170
-I know it's not good, Phil.
-Got to go, Cleav. Can we go?

530
00:22:50,237 --> 00:22:52,539
Hey, hey, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

531
00:22:53,106 --> 00:22:54,675
You going to the bowling thing,
right, Friday night?

532
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:55,909
-Uh...
-Vic is in.

533
00:22:56,009 --> 00:22:57,244
Yeah, not gonna be able
to make that one.

534
00:22:57,344 --> 00:22:58,879
Oh, they're gonna be pissed.
They're gonna be pissed at you.

535
00:22:58,946 --> 00:23:01,415
Yeah, well, I got to see
if Coco has

536
00:23:01,515 --> 00:23:03,550
plans. I might need to
watch the kids. All right?

537
00:23:04,585 --> 00:23:07,387
Okay, why can't Coco call you
and see if you have plans?

538
00:23:07,487 --> 00:23:08,589
You wouldn't understand, Cleav.

539
00:23:08,922 --> 00:23:10,023
-Right.
-Now, I got to go.

540
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,425
-I got to get back to work...
-Okay.

541
00:23:11,525 --> 00:23:13,060
-...at a job.
-Mm, booyah.

542
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:15,229
TQ, hey, always good to see you.

543
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:16,496
Don't hit the van, man.

544
00:23:17,197 --> 00:23:18,198
All right, man.

545
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:22,769
[quirky music]

546
00:23:31,211 --> 00:23:33,780
You always have
business-management classes.

547
00:23:33,881 --> 00:23:35,816
I know. I know. Come on,
I do this all the time.

548
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:37,117
-You should be used to that.
-But I need--

549
00:23:37,217 --> 00:23:39,386
-Stop tripping.
-Girl, they tried to arrest me!

550
00:23:39,987 --> 00:23:41,755
So what?
Do I look like I give a damn?

551
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:43,557
You told me
I could use your car.

552
00:23:43,624 --> 00:23:44,625
Yes, I did.

553
00:23:44,725 --> 00:23:46,593
Well, why'd you call the police
and report it stolen?

554
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:48,262
That ain't even relevant.

555
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:50,097
Girl, do you know I spent
a half a day

556
00:23:50,163 --> 00:23:51,231
at the police department?

557
00:23:51,298 --> 00:23:52,399
Do you see this finger?

558
00:23:52,466 --> 00:23:54,801
It's been missing something
for the last half decade.

559
00:23:55,469 --> 00:23:56,737
Why you keep sweating me?

560
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,705
Because you know what?
I am so sick and tired

561
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:00,240
of seeing everybody
around me

562
00:24:00,307 --> 00:24:01,441
getting married, Harold.

563
00:24:01,542 --> 00:24:03,010
-Like who?
-My cousin Shonda.

564
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,646
Francisco married her
to get a green card.

565
00:24:05,746 --> 00:24:08,649
-What about Janeece and Collin?
-Prison weddings don't work!

566
00:24:08,749 --> 00:24:09,917
He's doing life!

567
00:24:09,983 --> 00:24:11,552
Okay, what about
Keisha and Carvel?

568
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:13,287
He married her because
your spouse

569
00:24:13,353 --> 00:24:15,189
can't testify against you
in the court of law.

570
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:16,356
How about that, now, uh?

571
00:24:17,024 --> 00:24:18,492
Oh! [slapping]

572
00:24:18,592 --> 00:24:20,093
-Green card!
-Go! Get back!

573
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,895
That's why I ain't marrying you.
I got to go.

574
00:24:22,095 --> 00:24:23,463
You need to lose the key
on that.

575
00:24:23,564 --> 00:24:25,165
-Whatever.
-Yeah, you need to go somewhere.

576
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:26,567
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh.

577
00:24:33,173 --> 00:24:34,174
Open the door.

578
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:38,512
Hey, Callise,
let me get my phone.

579
00:24:38,846 --> 00:24:40,347
What? You got to be tripping.

580
00:24:40,848 --> 00:24:42,182
Girl, you better
give me my phone.

581
00:24:42,282 --> 00:24:43,517
You know what? Here.

582
00:24:43,617 --> 00:24:44,785
-I need--
-Take it.

583
00:24:48,455 --> 00:24:49,790
They cutting it off tomorrow
anyway,

584
00:24:49,857 --> 00:24:51,191
so it don't --
it don't even matter.

585
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:55,929
Babe, I got to leave soon.

586
00:24:56,129 --> 00:25:01,401
I know you have 20 minutes
for some dessert.

587
00:25:03,704 --> 00:25:05,339
Girl, you know I ain't got
no time for that.

588
00:25:06,073 --> 00:25:07,074
Oh.

589
00:25:11,211 --> 00:25:12,246
Are you sure?

590
00:25:15,048 --> 00:25:16,049
Nope.

591
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:19,353
Mm, mm-hmm.

592
00:25:20,821 --> 00:25:21,855
-Mm.
-Mm-hmm.

593
00:25:21,955 --> 00:25:23,624
Can I have some caramel
with my cafe mocha?

594
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,325
Mm-hmm. [chuckles]

595
00:25:25,392 --> 00:25:26,994
-Hmm.
-Mm.

596
00:25:27,194 --> 00:25:30,397
So sexy, so sexy

597
00:25:30,998 --> 00:25:33,500
Take your time,
Don't rush your love

598
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:37,371
Don't rush your love

599
00:25:37,437 --> 00:25:39,540
The way you put it on me

600
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,641
Oh

601
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:42,643
Girl, it affects me

602
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:44,244
It affects me

603
00:25:44,344 --> 00:25:46,880
All I want to do is...

604
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,516
Oh

605
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:52,419
Oh

606
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:53,554
Mm.

607
00:25:54,588 --> 00:25:56,423
Am I worth being late for?

608
00:25:57,824 --> 00:25:59,126
Most definitely.

609
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:01,195
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm.

610
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:04,031
Baby, you can go ahead
and take the car.

611
00:26:04,097 --> 00:26:05,933
I'm not gonna have time
to get dressed,

612
00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:08,836
and I'll just jog over
and pick it up later.

613
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,939
-You sure?
-Yes, baby.

614
00:26:12,206 --> 00:26:13,907
I'm gonna take a little nap
and get ready

615
00:26:14,007 --> 00:26:15,442
for round two tonight.

616
00:26:15,943 --> 00:26:17,678
-All right, now.
-Yeah.

617
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:18,846
Oh, wait, babe.

618
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:20,147
I'm supposed to meet the fellas
after work,

619
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:21,248
so I might be a little late.

620
00:26:21,715 --> 00:26:24,218
It's okay.
I can wait for you.

621
00:26:24,785 --> 00:26:27,020
-That's my girl.
-Mm.

622
00:26:28,222 --> 00:26:31,058
-See you later.
-Have a good rest of the day.

623
00:26:31,124 --> 00:26:32,893
-Thank you.
-Mm.

624
00:26:34,061 --> 00:26:35,395
Jason was thrown out
of the game

625
00:26:35,462 --> 00:26:37,464
for undercutting Nick
on a drive to the basket.

626
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:40,734
Nick West, five-time all-star
is here with us today.

627
00:26:40,801 --> 00:26:41,902
How are you doing, Nick?

628
00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:44,271
Fine, thank you,
I mean, considering.

629
00:26:45,072 --> 00:26:46,573
Ah, Zenobia, I just want
to say, um,

630
00:26:47,241 --> 00:26:49,743
Nick West was extremely pleased
to meet you the other night.

631
00:26:52,045 --> 00:26:53,280
On the tape,
it didn't look like Jason

632
00:26:53,347 --> 00:26:55,249
was intentionally
trying to undercut you.

633
00:26:56,517 --> 00:26:59,052
Well, maybe you might need
to rewind that highlight film

634
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:00,587
because that was
a straight hater move.

635
00:27:00,654 --> 00:27:02,122
He was definitely trying
to undercut Nick West,

636
00:27:02,256 --> 00:27:04,091
and that's why my teammates
rushed the floor like they did.

637
00:27:04,157 --> 00:27:06,226
You know what I'm saying?
[laughter]

638
00:27:07,227 --> 00:27:09,663
Well, actually,
in the play before,

639
00:27:09,763 --> 00:27:11,465
you elbow him in the jaw.

640
00:27:14,334 --> 00:27:18,438
Well, Zenobia, I mean,
basketball is a man's sport.

641
00:27:18,505 --> 00:27:21,542
It's a rough gang.
Elbows come with the territory.

642
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:22,910
Plus the referee
didn't see that,

643
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:25,646
so no harm, no foul.
[laughter]

644
00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:29,716
-I guess so.
-You know, I just wonder,

645
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:32,519
can I say on national television
that you are fine as hell?

646
00:27:32,786 --> 00:27:33,787
No, you can't.

647
00:27:34,188 --> 00:27:36,557
America, look at
Zenobia Cartwright.

648
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:40,327
She is a cold piece of work,
capital F, capital I,

649
00:27:40,394 --> 00:27:43,997
capital N, capital E, capitals,
all capitals, just fine.

650
00:27:44,097 --> 00:27:46,400
You know what I'm saying?
[laughter]

651
00:27:47,634 --> 00:27:49,403
Let's take a look
at your conference.

652
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:51,638
Mm, I'd love to have
a conference with you.

653
00:27:51,872 --> 00:27:54,208
Right now, your team
is on top of the division.

654
00:27:54,308 --> 00:27:58,178
-How does that make you feel?
-Hmm, good.

655
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:00,214
Nick West love to be on top.

656
00:28:00,948 --> 00:28:02,816
Don't you?

657
00:28:02,883 --> 00:28:04,484
Let's take a look at your game.

658
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:08,889
Do you prefer facing the basket
or backing people down?

659
00:28:09,957 --> 00:28:11,959
[laughter]

660
00:28:13,427 --> 00:28:17,231
Well, Zenobia, you know,
Nick West gets it in,

661
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:21,768
and I definitely love
to face in the basket,

662
00:28:22,069 --> 00:28:24,972
strong to the hole
all dang long.

663
00:28:25,405 --> 00:28:28,509
Nick West like to go down.
You know what I'm saying?

664
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:31,979
-Nick, thanks for coming in.
-Mm-hmm.

665
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:34,848
Let's go to Raoul Ramirez with
the coverage of the U.S. Open.

666
00:28:35,182 --> 00:28:36,216
-Thank you.
-Clear.

667
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:40,187
-Really? Really?
-What? Calm down, girl.

668
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:42,089
Girl, you know you're too
pretty to be

669
00:28:42,189 --> 00:28:43,624
all mad and angry like that.

670
00:28:43,724 --> 00:28:45,225
We really should go out
sometime.

671
00:28:45,325 --> 00:28:47,194
-Jimmy!
-No, no, no, no, hold up, girl.

672
00:28:47,261 --> 00:28:49,730
Why you gotta be all like that?
What you, about 5'10", 5'11"?

673
00:28:49,796 --> 00:28:51,532
I mean, we could make
a cold team, girl.

674
00:28:51,598 --> 00:28:53,400
You know what? You don't need
to say another other word to me.

675
00:28:53,467 --> 00:28:54,468
Why you gotta be like that?

676
00:28:54,568 --> 00:28:55,569
Girl, we could have
a starting five.

677
00:28:55,636 --> 00:28:57,070
I'll put a nice little power
forward right all up in...

678
00:28:57,171 --> 00:28:58,705
-Will you get...
-Hey, oh, hold up!

679
00:28:58,772 --> 00:28:59,873
-What the heck?
-Don't you put your hands on me!

680
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,542
-What the hell wrong with you?
-Security!

681
00:29:01,608 --> 00:29:03,243
I know this trick
didn't just slap Nick West.

682
00:29:03,343 --> 00:29:05,412
Did y'all get that on films?
Did y'all get that?

683
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:06,780
Hold up. I mean, what the hell
you gonna do?

684
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,183
Security! Security!

685
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:10,751
You see this?
You see this gator?

686
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:12,819
Endangered species,
and it will bite your ass.

687
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,921
-Bite your ass.
-You got a shoe?

688
00:29:13,987 --> 00:29:17,257
I got a shoe, too.
I got a shoe, too.

689
00:29:17,357 --> 00:29:19,560
You and the rest of the Skittles
need to get up and out of here!

690
00:29:19,626 --> 00:29:21,261
-I like 'em yelling mad.
-Okay.

691
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:23,764
[crickets chirping]

692
00:29:24,665 --> 00:29:26,934
Mm, mm.
[giggling]

693
00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:30,671
[baby crying]

694
00:29:31,972 --> 00:29:33,273
Wait, I know
you're not stopping.

695
00:29:34,074 --> 00:29:35,409
All this crying
not distracting you?

696
00:29:35,475 --> 00:29:38,545
No. No. Just... She'll stop.

697
00:29:38,612 --> 00:29:41,615
Come on.
Yeah.

698
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:43,817
Mm.

699
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:45,319
[crying continues]

700
00:29:47,554 --> 00:29:48,689
That crying
is not bothering you?

701
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:49,957
Ugh.

702
00:29:50,757 --> 00:29:54,795
Just get off me and get her
before she wakes up PJ.

703
00:29:55,495 --> 00:29:56,496
Why don't you go get her?

704
00:29:57,998 --> 00:29:59,566
Because I have to make
a phone call.

705
00:30:00,434 --> 00:30:02,436
[crying continues]

706
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:10,143
I couldn't believe it.

707
00:30:10,244 --> 00:30:12,112
Cathy said she was gonna come
down there and kick his ass.

708
00:30:12,446 --> 00:30:14,114
She might be corporate,
but she got some hood in her.

709
00:30:14,314 --> 00:30:15,482
I love working
for a black woman.

710
00:30:15,582 --> 00:30:16,617
The reason why I don't want
to get married!

711
00:30:16,683 --> 00:30:17,784
Just shut up
and pull your pants down!

712
00:30:17,851 --> 00:30:19,119
Put your pants on the ground!

713
00:30:19,186 --> 00:30:20,721
This is the last time
you gonna do this to me here.

714
00:30:20,821 --> 00:30:21,822
-You know what?
-Here.

715
00:30:21,889 --> 00:30:22,890
Get your hand out the way!

716
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,691
Will you get
your hand out the way?

717
00:30:25,993 --> 00:30:26,994
They smell like soap!

718
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,829
How the hell they gonna smell
like soap, Harold?

719
00:30:28,896 --> 00:30:30,030
You been working all day!

720
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,332
I went home,
and I took a shower.

721
00:30:33,033 --> 00:30:34,801
You didn't have time to go home
for lunch, Harold.

722
00:30:34,868 --> 00:30:35,869
Yes, I did.

723
00:30:36,203 --> 00:30:37,204
That's a lie, Harold.

724
00:30:37,304 --> 00:30:38,805
Why do you smell
like Irish Spring?

725
00:30:40,374 --> 00:30:41,375
Why does it smell
like Irish Spring?

726
00:30:41,475 --> 00:30:42,476
Who'd you go to lunch with?

727
00:30:42,543 --> 00:30:44,011
I ain't go to lunch
with nobody.

728
00:30:44,077 --> 00:30:45,179
-You did. Stop lying.
-Tired of you...

729
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,446
You hate Irish Spring!

730
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:48,815
-...accusing me
of cheating, man!

731
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:50,150
Harold, won't you
tell the truth?

732
00:30:51,084 --> 00:30:53,153
Who you go to lunch with? Huh?

733
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,488
I ain't go to lunch
with nobody.

734
00:30:54,555 --> 00:30:55,923
Well, they ain't supposed
to smell soapy.

735
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:57,090
They smell soapy!

736
00:30:57,824 --> 00:30:59,693
Okay, now you upset
about they smell.

737
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,095
First you was saying,
"Your balls smell sweaty,

738
00:31:02,196 --> 00:31:04,565
they smell sweaty."
Now they smell like soap.

739
00:31:04,831 --> 00:31:06,066
You mad about that.

740
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,635
Harold, who you go
to lunch with?

741
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:13,307
I went to lunch with my balls
and no soap.

742
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:15,209
-I told you I wasn't cheating.
-Crazy.

743
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:17,110
How about I hit the balls
with a baby wipe?

744
00:31:17,344 --> 00:31:19,112
A baby wipe ain't going
to hit them balls.

745
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:21,348
I hit the balls with a baby
wipe, I'm telling you.

746
00:31:21,415 --> 00:31:23,116
You been working all day,
and you gonna swipe it

747
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:24,218
with a baby wipe?

748
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:27,554
This is what it smelled
like earlier today.

749
00:31:27,754 --> 00:31:29,022
Ew, that's nasty.

750
00:31:29,723 --> 00:31:31,558
Now, I'm telling you,
I ain't got to lie.

751
00:31:31,925 --> 00:31:34,728
My balls have smelled
the same since I was 2.

752
00:31:34,862 --> 00:31:36,196
Call my mother now and ask her.

753
00:31:36,263 --> 00:31:37,364
I don't need to call your mama,

754
00:31:37,431 --> 00:31:38,432
I know what your balls
smell like,

755
00:31:38,532 --> 00:31:39,900
and they don't smell like
Irish Spring.

756
00:31:39,967 --> 00:31:41,668
-Get the key.
-I'm trying!

757
00:31:42,703 --> 00:31:47,040
Oh, girl, I can't believe
she's giving him the smell test.

758
00:31:47,107 --> 00:31:48,775
She is so insecure.
I mean,

759
00:31:48,876 --> 00:31:50,511
who does stuff like that?

760
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:52,346
Why don't you tell me
what this big idea

761
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:53,714
about finding me a man is?

762
00:31:54,715 --> 00:31:56,583
-Huh?
-Bam.

763
00:31:58,285 --> 00:32:00,254
-The Internet?
-Yes, girl.

764
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,155
Haven't you seen them
commercials on television?

765
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:03,891
Girl, please.

766
00:32:04,925 --> 00:32:06,393
Girl, I don't do
Internet dating.

767
00:32:06,727 --> 00:32:08,929
Well, right now,
you're not doing any dating.

768
00:32:09,162 --> 00:32:10,898
You need to give yourself
some options.

769
00:32:11,398 --> 00:32:13,867
I know, but there are a lot
of freaks on the Internet.

770
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:16,603
Look, I went online
this afternoon,

771
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:19,139
found some interesting guys.

772
00:32:19,806 --> 00:32:21,642
Come on, Zen.
It can't hurt to take a look.

773
00:32:23,977 --> 00:32:25,078
Okay, what is this?

774
00:32:25,646 --> 00:32:29,116
-Solidsoulmates.com?
-Yes, ma'am.

775
00:32:29,183 --> 00:32:30,717
Oh, look at him. Look, look.

776
00:32:31,151 --> 00:32:32,986
Ooh, he is kind of cute.
Click his profile.

777
00:32:33,086 --> 00:32:34,655
Oh, I already marked his page.

778
00:32:34,755 --> 00:32:36,490
I don't know about all this.

779
00:32:37,658 --> 00:32:39,293
-Listen.
-What?

780
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:40,627
-Hear that?
-Hear what?

781
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:43,564
That ticking noise.

782
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:46,366
Who was just talking about their
biological clock was ticking?

783
00:32:46,667 --> 00:32:48,001
Ticktock, ticktock, tick.

784
00:32:48,268 --> 00:32:51,171
Look, I know, but my face
is recognizable.

785
00:32:51,271 --> 00:32:54,041
Zen, this stuff
is totally confidential.

786
00:32:55,175 --> 00:32:56,176
You're tripping.

787
00:33:00,447 --> 00:33:03,383
Wait a minute.
I do hear the ticking.

788
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:07,921
Okay, let's start with him,
Zane Thomas.

789
00:33:08,222 --> 00:33:09,223
Hmm.

790
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:11,291
Wow, he looks young for his age.

791
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:14,161
Yeah, he does have a baby face,
but he's cute.

792
00:33:15,596 --> 00:33:17,598
Well, hello, Zane.

793
00:33:21,935 --> 00:33:23,070
Oh, hey, Zen.

794
00:33:26,507 --> 00:33:29,476
-Hey, Austin.
-Hi, honey.

795
00:33:29,543 --> 00:33:33,180
Okay, so, uh, I walk in,
and you close the laptop

796
00:33:33,247 --> 00:33:34,414
as if you got
something to hide.

797
00:33:34,615 --> 00:33:35,949
-Really?
-No.

798
00:33:40,954 --> 00:33:43,223
-What you doing?
-Excuse me.

799
00:33:43,323 --> 00:33:44,992
-Move over. Move over.
-What?

800
00:33:45,058 --> 00:33:46,527
-Baby?
-Let go.

801
00:33:46,627 --> 00:33:48,028
-No.
-If you got nothing to hide,

802
00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:49,997
-why you tripping? Let go.
-You let go!

803
00:33:50,063 --> 00:33:52,065
Wait, wait, wait, Zen,
it is his laptop.

804
00:33:55,169 --> 00:33:56,737
[sighs] God.

805
00:34:03,544 --> 00:34:05,445
Solidsoulmates.com?

806
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,114
This is so embarrassing.

807
00:34:07,447 --> 00:34:09,716
-What?
-Okay, that's enough.

808
00:34:09,816 --> 00:34:10,817
I said stop.

809
00:34:11,518 --> 00:34:13,453
-Baby!
-Okay, okay, okay.

810
00:34:13,554 --> 00:34:16,456
All I know is,
this better be for her.

811
00:34:16,557 --> 00:34:18,859
Anyway, just, ugh.

812
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,528
I don't know why you going
on here anyway.

813
00:34:21,595 --> 00:34:23,130
I hooked you up
with a couple of guys.

814
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,933
Oh, thank you.
Yeah, I remember, Xavier.

815
00:34:26,033 --> 00:34:27,701
-Uh-huh.
-He's in a dance troupe now.

816
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:31,271
Okay, well, that didn't work
out so well,

817
00:34:31,371 --> 00:34:32,873
but what about Alfredo Ascue?

818
00:34:33,273 --> 00:34:34,274
You blew him off.

819
00:34:34,408 --> 00:34:35,409
-Nice guy,
-Wow.

820
00:34:35,475 --> 00:34:38,412
professional athlete,
tall,single and just...

821
00:34:38,478 --> 00:34:42,015
Orange suits
with shoes to match, hello? No.

822
00:34:42,716 --> 00:34:45,185
You know what?
I went to school with that man.

823
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,254
Okay, that is a good man.

824
00:34:47,321 --> 00:34:49,723
He asked about you the other
day, as a matter of fact.

825
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:50,791
Asked you about what?

826
00:34:51,091 --> 00:34:52,259
He wanted to know what happened.

827
00:34:52,726 --> 00:34:54,561
I didn't know whether I was
going to the club with him

828
00:34:55,028 --> 00:34:57,030
or going trick-or-treating.
That's what happened.

829
00:34:57,331 --> 00:35:00,200
That's why you single now
because you're too picky, punk.

830
00:35:00,801 --> 00:35:01,869
I gotta take a shower.

831
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:05,239
-Candy corn.
-You guys.

832
00:35:05,305 --> 00:35:08,609
-That was so not comfortable.
-He was just playing.

833
00:35:08,675 --> 00:35:11,578
-I got to go.
-All right, girl.

834
00:35:11,645 --> 00:35:14,448
Well, just take my car
because I got to take a shower.

835
00:35:14,515 --> 00:35:17,451
-Are you sure?
-Oh, yeah.

836
00:35:17,818 --> 00:35:19,653
She do this every week, man.

837
00:35:20,754 --> 00:35:23,790
And if you don't want me,
why keep my Xbox?

838
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:25,893
-All right.
-All right. Be careful.

839
00:35:27,895 --> 00:35:30,130
-Bye.
-All I want is my Xbox.

840
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,431
-Girl.
-What?

841
00:35:32,266 --> 00:35:34,368
-The police are here.
-[gasps] Oh, move!

842
00:35:34,468 --> 00:35:35,836
Let me see, let me see.

843
00:35:35,936 --> 00:35:38,071
-Harold's getting arrested.
-Let me see.

844
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:40,007
But we'll get to the bottom
of it, no problem.

845
00:35:41,341 --> 00:35:42,709
See, that's what
I'm talking about, see?

846
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:44,778
-Mm.
-The whole apartment...

847
00:35:45,245 --> 00:35:46,914
-Did he see us? Did he see us?
-He did see us.

848
00:35:48,549 --> 00:35:49,550
-Okay.
-Okay.

849
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:50,851
-I'll call you later.
-Go.

850
00:35:51,552 --> 00:35:53,187
Because she just hollered out
my name

851
00:35:53,287 --> 00:35:54,821
-and did all kind of stuff.
-Right.

852
00:35:54,922 --> 00:35:56,290
You making sure they know
you for sure now.

853
00:35:56,356 --> 00:35:57,524
-And there...
-Excuse me,

854
00:35:57,624 --> 00:36:00,994
aren't you Zenobia Cartwright
from Net Central Sports?

855
00:36:01,094 --> 00:36:02,729
-Yes, hi.
-Yes, indeed.

856
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:04,331
-How are you?
-I'm good, thanks.

857
00:36:04,398 --> 00:36:07,034
I didn't realize
you were so tall.

858
00:36:07,568 --> 00:36:10,838
Yeah, TV subtracts 5 inches
and adds 15 pounds.

859
00:36:11,138 --> 00:36:12,973
Look like they put it
in all the right places to me.

860
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,008
What you think? My, oh, my.

861
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:16,510
-Thank you, officer.
-Mm.

862
00:36:17,277 --> 00:36:18,512
Hey, I like what you did
with Nick.

863
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:21,982
That was, that was really,
really nice.

864
00:36:22,049 --> 00:36:23,717
-Wow.
-Well, I'm calm now.

865
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:27,287
-So is she answering?
-No, she still ain't answering.

866
00:36:27,387 --> 00:36:29,690
Let's try this right here.
Let's try this right here.

867
00:36:31,158 --> 00:36:33,660
-Excuse me, Callise.
-Okay.

868
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,596
-This is the police.
-Please, please, sir.

869
00:36:35,696 --> 00:36:37,364
Please bring your ass
out of here.

870
00:36:37,698 --> 00:36:38,765
-Can you be quiet?
-We're not gonna...

871
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:40,434
Okay, so you want
another charge against you?

872
00:36:40,534 --> 00:36:41,735
-I don't want another charge.
-Okay.

873
00:36:41,835 --> 00:36:42,836
-Sir, relax.
-Can you please be quiet?

874
00:36:42,903 --> 00:36:43,904
-I am gonna be.
-Ma'am,

875
00:36:44,004 --> 00:36:45,739
we'll come back another time.
Thank you so much.

876
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:46,840
Ma'am, no, we won't.

877
00:36:46,907 --> 00:36:49,176
-Give us the damn Xbox. Ma'am!
-Let's throw him out of here.

878
00:36:50,677 --> 00:36:52,679
[casual music]

879
00:36:54,681 --> 00:36:58,218
-I'm ready.
-Ooh, round two?

880
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:02,723
No. I'm ready to have a baby.

881
00:37:03,323 --> 00:37:05,459
Oh, man, come on, not again.

882
00:37:06,593 --> 00:37:10,063
-What you mean, "Not again"?
-I told you, we're not ready.

883
00:37:10,163 --> 00:37:11,431
No, you're not ready.

884
00:37:11,598 --> 00:37:13,333
Look, if I get
this management position

885
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,535
we'll have extra income,
and then

886
00:37:14,601 --> 00:37:15,903
-You said that...
-we can talk about

887
00:37:16,036 --> 00:37:17,371
-You said that
-having a baby.

888
00:37:17,437 --> 00:37:19,206
-two years ago
when you found this job.

889
00:37:19,873 --> 00:37:21,575
Why are you so obsessed
about this?

890
00:37:24,111 --> 00:37:25,646
-I'm not obsessed.

891
00:37:25,779 --> 00:37:27,781
Okay, obviously
I shouldn't have said that.

892
00:37:27,881 --> 00:37:29,049
No, you shouldn't have.

893
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:31,885
I'm 37 years old. You're 34.

894
00:37:31,952 --> 00:37:33,587
I don't want to wait
until it's too late.

895
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:35,923
Women have babies
in their 40s all the time.

896
00:37:36,557 --> 00:37:37,558
40s?

897
00:37:38,225 --> 00:37:40,427
You think I want to have a baby
in my 40s?

898
00:37:40,961 --> 00:37:43,630
Babe, we can't rush a baby.

899
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,465
We've been married
for three years.

900
00:37:45,566 --> 00:37:47,467
We have more than enough money
in the bank.

901
00:37:48,368 --> 00:37:49,803
All I hear is excuses from you.

902
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:54,107
-Austin?
-I'm tired.

903
00:37:55,809 --> 00:37:56,944
Can we just go to sleep?

904
00:37:59,012 --> 00:38:01,682
-[scoffs]
-[sighs]

905
00:38:01,782 --> 00:38:02,783
Okay.

906
00:38:04,151 --> 00:38:05,853
You thought I was ready
for round two.

907
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,955
You wouldn't say,
"Hey, I'm tired".

908
00:38:09,122 --> 00:38:10,324
Now we want to talk
about something

909
00:38:10,424 --> 00:38:11,458
I want to talk about,

910
00:38:12,326 --> 00:38:13,627
you tired all of a sudden.

911
00:38:17,865 --> 00:38:19,399
Well, one of the things
we have in common

912
00:38:19,466 --> 00:38:21,835
is that both of our first names
begin with Z.

913
00:38:22,402 --> 00:38:23,804
-Good point.
- Yeah.

914
00:38:25,439 --> 00:38:26,874
You know, I got to tell you,

915
00:38:28,342 --> 00:38:30,344
I've never done
the Internet thing before.

916
00:38:30,511 --> 00:38:32,312
This is definitely
a first for me.

917
00:38:32,412 --> 00:38:33,514
You sure about that?

918
00:38:34,248 --> 00:38:36,250
I went on Soul Mates
because I just got tired

919
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:37,684
of the process of dating.

920
00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:43,824
It's, it's really
hard out there.

921
00:38:43,891 --> 00:38:44,992
Yeah, it is.

922
00:38:45,058 --> 00:38:46,793
My girlfriend talked me
into calling.

923
00:38:47,461 --> 00:38:49,296
You sure you're not
some kind of serial killer?

924
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,532
Girl, I haven't been in jail
in 10 years.

925
00:38:51,632 --> 00:38:53,166
[both laugh]

926
00:38:56,904 --> 00:39:00,874
-So what do you do?
-Well, I do consulting work.

927
00:39:02,042 --> 00:39:06,813
I write songs, and I
write poetry professionally.

928
00:39:08,482 --> 00:39:09,983
Wow, you write poetry?

929
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:13,187
Yes, and, um, I'm pretty good.

930
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,190
Really?
Well, let me hear some.

931
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,658
Nah.

932
00:39:17,724 --> 00:39:20,661
-Come on.
-My stuff is a little different.

933
00:39:21,061 --> 00:39:23,197
Well, I'm a little different.

934
00:39:23,764 --> 00:39:24,765
Okay.

935
00:39:26,567 --> 00:39:27,935
"The river runs deep

936
00:39:29,303 --> 00:39:31,238
in the land
once inhabited by few.

937
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:38,245
The path was there,
as I noted the morning dew.

938
00:39:39,947 --> 00:39:41,515
Transparency...

939
00:39:42,349 --> 00:39:44,184
...is the order of the days.

940
00:39:45,052 --> 00:39:48,422
Wrapped in a blanket
is where life lays.

941
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,258
There's a light from the sun,

942
00:39:54,094 --> 00:39:56,697
the smoke from a gun.

943
00:39:57,564 --> 00:40:02,970
It's time to put the package
to sleep

944
00:40:04,872 --> 00:40:09,510
in the middle of the river
where it runs deep."

945
00:40:14,548 --> 00:40:15,549
That was nice.

946
00:40:16,683 --> 00:40:18,785
A little scary, but nice.

947
00:40:19,553 --> 00:40:20,621
I thought you might like it.

948
00:40:21,522 --> 00:40:22,890
I'm really not done with it yet.

949
00:40:23,524 --> 00:40:24,958
I'm really proud of that piece,

950
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:28,962
but, you know,
it's definitely uplifting.

951
00:40:29,396 --> 00:40:30,931
Oh, huh.

952
00:40:30,998 --> 00:40:33,567
So let's talk about you.
Uh, what kind of work do you do?

953
00:40:33,934 --> 00:40:35,235
I'm a broadcaster.

954
00:40:35,302 --> 00:40:37,804
-Radio?
-No, TV.

955
00:40:37,905 --> 00:40:38,906
TV?

956
00:40:40,274 --> 00:40:41,942
You're not Zenobia Cartwright,
are you?

957
00:40:44,011 --> 00:40:46,146
-Yes, I am.
-[chuckles]

958
00:40:48,282 --> 00:40:49,716
How'd you guess?

959
00:40:49,783 --> 00:40:51,485
How many people you know
named Zenobia?

960
00:40:52,486 --> 00:40:53,487
I guess that's true.

961
00:40:55,355 --> 00:40:57,024
Well, you know, now at least
I don't have to ask

962
00:40:57,124 --> 00:40:58,125
what you look like.

963
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:00,460
I guess not.

964
00:41:02,329 --> 00:41:06,767
Zenobia, you are very beautiful.

965
00:41:09,169 --> 00:41:11,038
Thank you. Thank you, Zane.

966
00:41:11,271 --> 00:41:12,573
Listen,

967
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:13,674
can we hook up?

968
00:41:16,677 --> 00:41:17,778
Let's do lunch.

969
00:41:18,345 --> 00:41:20,047
No, no, no, no, no.

970
00:41:21,114 --> 00:41:23,016
You are way too fine for lunch.

971
00:41:24,384 --> 00:41:25,485
Let's do dinner.

972
00:41:25,586 --> 00:41:28,055
Oh, well, dinner is when
I get to know you better.

973
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:30,691
Well, I kind of work
during the day, so...

974
00:41:31,525 --> 00:41:32,993
...dinner is my only option.

975
00:41:34,127 --> 00:41:36,129
[reflective music]

976
00:41:40,701 --> 00:41:41,702
Hello?

977
00:41:43,136 --> 00:41:45,506
No, I'm here. I'm here.
Okay, dinner.

978
00:41:46,206 --> 00:41:47,875
Do you know where
Net Central Sports is?

979
00:41:48,308 --> 00:41:49,810
Yeah, it's about 20 minutes
away from me.

980
00:41:50,344 --> 00:41:53,180
Oh, really? Okay, well,
then how about Saturday night

981
00:41:53,247 --> 00:41:56,316
after my last broadcast,
um, 8:30?

982
00:41:56,950 --> 00:42:01,421
That's great. Hey, Zenobia.
I hope you can dance.

983
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,624
Well, I can't wait.

984
00:42:14,535 --> 00:42:17,237
-Will you guys hurry up?
-Can you just wait a minute?

985
00:42:17,337 --> 00:42:20,274
Hey, what was taking so long
is waiting on 13s for women!

986
00:42:20,374 --> 00:42:21,408
Stop it.

987
00:42:22,042 --> 00:42:23,243
You are heavy-handed.

988
00:42:23,343 --> 00:42:24,845
-Where's Phil?
-I don't know.

989
00:42:24,912 --> 00:42:27,915
-He said he'd be here later.
-Um, excuse me, um, these stink.

990
00:42:28,015 --> 00:42:29,516
Could I possibly
just get another pair?

991
00:42:29,583 --> 00:42:30,584
Thank you.

992
00:42:31,552 --> 00:42:32,553
Yeah, right.

993
00:42:32,653 --> 00:42:34,121
Yeah, right,
I'm delivering a message.

994
00:42:34,254 --> 00:42:35,656
That's all I am
is the messenger.

995
00:42:35,722 --> 00:42:37,291
He said he'd be here late.
He'll be here.

996
00:42:37,558 --> 00:42:38,892
No, no, no, these stink, too.

997
00:42:41,929 --> 00:42:44,464
There ain't nothing wrong
with these, sweetie.

998
00:42:46,366 --> 00:42:48,769
-Did she just call me sweetie?
-Yeah, she did.

999
00:42:49,469 --> 00:42:52,005
Well, I'm gonna need
another pair, sweetie.

1000
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:55,209
All right.

1001
00:42:56,577 --> 00:42:58,946
-Zen, they bowling shoes.
-They stink!

1002
00:42:59,046 --> 00:43:00,581
They're gonna stink!
It's bowling shoes!

1003
00:43:00,681 --> 00:43:02,616
-...no nasty shoe!
-Oh, right, okay.

1004
00:43:05,752 --> 00:43:07,454
Okay, okay.

1005
00:43:07,554 --> 00:43:08,555
Okay.

1006
00:43:09,389 --> 00:43:10,390
-Oh, hey. Wait a minute.
-Thank you.

1007
00:43:10,457 --> 00:43:11,458
[coughs]

1008
00:43:11,658 --> 00:43:14,194
Hey, Falinda.

1009
00:43:14,595 --> 00:43:16,296
-Hey. How are you?
-Hey.

1010
00:43:16,396 --> 00:43:17,397
Obama!

1011
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:20,467
I'm sorry.
I don't remember your name.

1012
00:43:20,567 --> 00:43:22,302
It's Cleavon, Cleavon Henry.

1013
00:43:22,402 --> 00:43:23,971
Remember, you met me
at Zenobia's party?

1014
00:43:25,138 --> 00:43:26,340
-Oh, yeah. Hey!
-Yeah.

1015
00:43:26,607 --> 00:43:27,608
Hey.

1016
00:43:27,674 --> 00:43:28,675
-Hey.
-Oh girl.

1017
00:43:28,775 --> 00:43:29,810
-Hi, Zenobia.
-How you doing?

1018
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:32,446
-How are you?
-I'm good. Lane six, boy.

1019
00:43:32,513 --> 00:43:34,314
I will see you there.

1020
00:43:35,582 --> 00:43:36,683
-So...
-So...

1021
00:43:36,783 --> 00:43:38,218
How's, uh, how's school going?

1022
00:43:38,986 --> 00:43:40,053
How'd you know I was in school?

1023
00:43:40,787 --> 00:43:41,989
You told me at the party.

1024
00:43:42,089 --> 00:43:43,657
You said you were in school.
You're studying to be an RN.

1025
00:43:44,591 --> 00:43:46,493
Yeah, yeah, LVN.

1026
00:43:46,927 --> 00:43:48,161
-Right.
-No, yeah, yeah,

1027
00:43:48,262 --> 00:43:49,530
LVN, I'm sorry.

1028
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:52,099
Yeah, it was going good.
I graduate next week.

1029
00:43:52,165 --> 00:43:54,168
-Oh.
-Then comes the hard part.

1030
00:43:54,902 --> 00:43:56,136
-What's that?
What's the hard part?

1031
00:43:56,236 --> 00:43:57,371
Looking for a job.

1032
00:43:57,471 --> 00:43:58,639
-Ah.
-Yeah.

1033
00:43:58,705 --> 00:44:00,073
-Okay.
-Hey, what took you so long?

1034
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,642
Hey, baby, trying to find
a parking space.

1035
00:44:01,708 --> 00:44:03,310
-It's crazy out there.
-Oh, okay.

1036
00:44:03,377 --> 00:44:05,345
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Roderick.

1037
00:44:05,445 --> 00:44:06,446
-Oh, hey.
-How you doing?

1038
00:44:06,513 --> 00:44:07,514
Cleavon.

1039
00:44:07,714 --> 00:44:09,917
-How you doing, champ?
-How you doing?

1040
00:44:09,983 --> 00:44:10,984
All right.
Hey babe,

1041
00:44:11,084 --> 00:44:12,920
can you get me a size 15?

1042
00:44:13,954 --> 00:44:15,522
-So I'll get your favorite ball.
-Okay.

1043
00:44:15,622 --> 00:44:17,157
-All right. Be right back.
- All right.

1044
00:44:17,257 --> 00:44:19,526
-Good meeting you, too, man.
-Hey, ditto.

1045
00:44:21,628 --> 00:44:22,629
I didn't, uh,

1046
00:44:22,696 --> 00:44:24,831
I didn't know
you had a boyfriend.

1047
00:44:24,932 --> 00:44:26,500
Oh, no, he's not my boyfriend.

1048
00:44:26,567 --> 00:44:29,102
He's just a friend,
someone I kick it with.

1049
00:44:29,169 --> 00:44:31,572
Oh, you kick it. What's kick it?

1050
00:44:33,173 --> 00:44:35,008
Someone I hang out with
time to time?

1051
00:44:35,108 --> 00:44:36,176
Oh, okay, yeah.

1052
00:44:36,677 --> 00:44:39,646
Hey, I was wondering,
I don't know, before you leave,

1053
00:44:39,713 --> 00:44:41,181
would it be weird if I got you--

1054
00:44:41,281 --> 00:44:42,382
-Oh.
-Look, babe,

1055
00:44:42,482 --> 00:44:44,651
-I found your favorite ball.
-There it is.

1056
00:44:44,718 --> 00:44:46,186
-Mm-hmm.
-Next in line, please.

1057
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:48,722
-Okay, that's us, so...
-Oh.

1058
00:44:49,022 --> 00:44:50,190
It was good to see you again.

1059
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:52,759
-Yeah, no. All right. Same here
-Okay.

1060
00:44:53,227 --> 00:44:54,294
-Right.
-All right.

1061
00:44:55,829 --> 00:44:57,397
-All right, man.
-All right, big fella.

1062
00:44:57,497 --> 00:44:58,599
-Okay.
-Yeah.

1063
00:44:58,699 --> 00:44:59,867
Cool. He's funny.

1064
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:05,439
Cleavon, come on!
You holding the game up!

1065
00:45:05,739 --> 00:45:07,074
Yeah, let's go!

1066
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:09,977
I'm coming now.
Got to get my shoes.

1067
00:45:10,611 --> 00:45:12,212
I'll get them.
I'll come back and get them.

1068
00:45:12,312 --> 00:45:14,882
-We waiting on Phil anyway!
-No, we waiting on you.

1069
00:45:15,249 --> 00:45:19,019
Put the ball in my face, man!
He put the ball in my face.

1070
00:45:23,857 --> 00:45:25,859
[buoyant music]

1071
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,975
I need to speak to you
for a second.

1072
00:46:15,075 --> 00:46:16,076
Yo, man, what's up?

1073
00:46:17,845 --> 00:46:19,980
Falinda, I need to talk to you,
and I need to get your number.

1074
00:46:20,314 --> 00:46:23,750
Cleavon, you're putting me in a
very awkward position right now.

1075
00:46:24,985 --> 00:46:26,220
Will you sit down, bitch?

1076
00:46:27,254 --> 00:46:28,856
Cleavon, I don't even know you!

1077
00:46:29,256 --> 00:46:30,691
Yeah, and you about
to get socked up.

1078
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:32,793
Okay, just please
let me handle this.

1079
00:46:33,293 --> 00:46:35,295
Cleavon, why are you doing this?

1080
00:46:35,395 --> 00:46:36,430
I don't know. All right.

1081
00:46:36,496 --> 00:46:37,831
Do you believe in love
at first sight?

1082
00:46:38,632 --> 00:46:40,100
I mean, yeah. It happens.

1083
00:46:40,167 --> 00:46:41,969
Okay, I cannot get you
out of my head.

1084
00:46:42,035 --> 00:46:44,137
I mean,
I see your face in my dreams.

1085
00:46:44,671 --> 00:46:46,039
You got about 30 more seconds.

1086
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:47,407
Didn't I just tell you
to sit down?

1087
00:46:47,674 --> 00:46:49,710
Cleavon, I need to
get back to bowling,

1088
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:52,646
so I'll give you my number
after we leave here, okay?

1089
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:54,348
I'm in love with you.

1090
00:46:57,351 --> 00:46:58,785
I don't know what to say.

1091
00:46:59,453 --> 00:47:01,788
-Say nothing.
-[gasps] Oh.

1092
00:47:03,357 --> 00:47:05,826
[screams]
[punch]

1093
00:47:07,594 --> 00:47:09,129
Cleavon! What's wrong with you?

1094
00:47:11,832 --> 00:47:15,002
Excuse me. How you doing? Oh.

1095
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:21,608
Oh, hey, Cleav.
Uh, three times in one week,

1096
00:47:21,675 --> 00:47:22,876
you going for the record.

1097
00:47:22,976 --> 00:47:25,279
Well, it's not normally
this crowded on a Saturday.

1098
00:47:25,345 --> 00:47:26,346
I know.

1099
00:47:26,446 --> 00:47:28,182
Hey, when they gonna get you
some help in here anyway?

1100
00:47:28,815 --> 00:47:31,285
-Soon, I hope.
-Hey, how long I gotta wait?

1101
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:34,821
I could slip you
into room three.

1102
00:47:35,055 --> 00:47:36,657
Are you serious? Thank you.

1103
00:47:36,723 --> 00:47:37,991
-Mm-hmm.
-I got stuff to do today.

1104
00:47:38,058 --> 00:47:39,293
You gonna need a courtesy pack?

1105
00:47:42,062 --> 00:47:43,664
Why do you have to talk so loud?

1106
00:47:44,631 --> 00:47:46,700
Everybody in here is in here
for the same reason.

1107
00:47:46,767 --> 00:47:47,935
Do you want a pack or not?

1108
00:47:48,035 --> 00:47:50,370
-Give me the pack.
-Okay. You want petroleum

1109
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:51,672
-Just give me the pack.
-or lotion?

1110
00:47:52,673 --> 00:47:54,074
I know you like that lotion.

1111
00:47:54,174 --> 00:47:55,843
-Gonna need any goggles today?
-No, I don't.

1112
00:47:55,909 --> 00:47:58,312
Keep them down there. Thank you.

1113
00:47:58,378 --> 00:47:59,680
Oh, we got some new magazines.

1114
00:47:59,746 --> 00:48:01,181
We got "Little Blow Peeps"

1115
00:48:01,782 --> 00:48:04,718
-and the "Esophagus Girls."
-Give me the DVD.

1116
00:48:05,853 --> 00:48:08,322
Alrighty. What about this?

1117
00:48:09,022 --> 00:48:10,424
"Butt Pirates of the Bahamas."

1118
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:13,694
Put the DVD back.
I'll take the magazine.

1119
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,529
-Thank you. Room three, right?
-Room three.

1120
00:48:15,796 --> 00:48:16,797
Every day with you.

1121
00:48:18,198 --> 00:48:19,967
-You better watch yourself.
-You watch yourself, Donya.

1122
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:24,538
[yells] Get out of here!

1123
00:48:24,605 --> 00:48:27,407
Uh, nobody was supposed
to be in here.

1124
00:48:28,141 --> 00:48:29,443
What are you doing?

1125
00:48:30,244 --> 00:48:33,347
Oh, no, so violent.

1126
00:49:02,976 --> 00:49:03,977
[sighs]

1127
00:49:12,019 --> 00:49:14,421
It's going on 2 1/2 days,
and you're still not speaking?

1128
00:49:16,456 --> 00:49:17,891
-And?
-"And"?

1129
00:49:18,025 --> 00:49:20,260
-When you gonna talk?
-I ain't got nothing to say.

1130
00:49:21,094 --> 00:49:23,564
You know, I'm starting
to get sick of this.

1131
00:49:24,031 --> 00:49:26,733
-That would make two of us.
-What do you want from me?

1132
00:49:28,569 --> 00:49:30,804
I am ready to start a family.

1133
00:49:30,904 --> 00:49:32,105
Oh, come on, Vic.

1134
00:49:32,606 --> 00:49:35,175
Do you know how it feels,
how degrading it is

1135
00:49:35,275 --> 00:49:38,011
to have to beg someone
you committed your whole life to

1136
00:49:38,378 --> 00:49:39,379
to have a baby?

1137
00:49:42,349 --> 00:49:43,584
-I'm going to the gym.
-That's right.

1138
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:45,953
Run like a little boy,
like you always do.

1139
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,321
Oh, okay.

1140
00:49:47,387 --> 00:49:48,922
So now we back on my age again?

1141
00:49:50,023 --> 00:49:53,393
Do I always have to get these
snarky, little boy comments?

1142
00:49:54,061 --> 00:49:56,029
When the facts come up,
that's what you do.

1143
00:49:56,129 --> 00:49:57,998
-You run.
-Just what are the facts?

1144
00:49:58,065 --> 00:50:00,834
The fact is,
I'm ready to start a family.

1145
00:50:00,934 --> 00:50:03,136
I want to have a baby.
That's what married couples do.

1146
00:50:03,203 --> 00:50:04,238
They reproduce.

1147
00:50:04,338 --> 00:50:05,372
I am tired of you

1148
00:50:05,472 --> 00:50:07,007
I am tired of you
putting so much pressure on me.

1149
00:50:07,608 --> 00:50:09,343
I can't even enjoy
having sex with you

1150
00:50:09,409 --> 00:50:11,144
because I feel like
you're trying to set me up.

1151
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:14,648
Wait a minute, set you up?

1152
00:50:16,149 --> 00:50:18,819
Set you up?
How do I set up my husband?

1153
00:50:18,886 --> 00:50:20,487
I am your wife, Austin!

1154
00:50:21,221 --> 00:50:23,624
How am I setting you up?
No, come back out here!

1155
00:50:24,091 --> 00:50:27,361
Austin, boy, you better
come back out here.

1156
00:50:27,427 --> 00:50:29,029
-We are not finished.
-You want to talk about facts?

1157
00:50:29,096 --> 00:50:30,330
Yeah, I want to talk
about the facts.

1158
00:50:31,064 --> 00:50:33,834
Fact number one, I know
your body better than you do.

1159
00:50:34,268 --> 00:50:35,869
I know what time of the month
you're ovulating

1160
00:50:35,969 --> 00:50:37,671
and that's when you really
put pressure on me

1161
00:50:37,738 --> 00:50:39,673
-to have sex with you.
-That is not true.

1162
00:50:39,806 --> 00:50:42,042
I'm on the pill,
and you still pull out.

1163
00:50:42,109 --> 00:50:44,344
Do you know how humiliating
that makes me feel?

1164
00:50:44,411 --> 00:50:46,880
I am not some jump-off.
I'm your wife!

1165
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:47,981
Let me finish.

1166
00:50:48,515 --> 00:50:50,918
Fact number two,
I don't always have to work late

1167
00:50:51,018 --> 00:50:52,085
I just don't want to come home.

1168
00:50:53,554 --> 00:50:55,022
-Okay, that's enough.
-Fact number three,

1169
00:50:55,088 --> 00:50:57,424
-Austin, stop. Austin.
-fact number three,

1170
00:50:58,859 --> 00:51:00,360
the real reason I don't want
to have a baby

1171
00:51:00,427 --> 00:51:01,562
with you is because...

1172
00:51:04,298 --> 00:51:06,400
...I don't know how long
I'm gonna be married to you.

1173
00:51:25,252 --> 00:51:26,253
[exhales]

1174
00:51:28,889 --> 00:51:30,757
[news fanfare]

1175
00:51:32,292 --> 00:51:35,462
And Nick West was whistled
once again for the flagrant foul

1176
00:51:35,562 --> 00:51:36,897
and ejected. His team loses

1177
00:51:36,964 --> 00:51:39,399
loses by 20.
That's it for me tonight.

1178
00:51:39,466 --> 00:51:41,335
I'm Zenobia Cartwright
and more Central Sports

1179
00:51:41,435 --> 00:51:43,337
coming up next with
Dave Richards after the break.

1180
00:51:43,937 --> 00:51:44,938
Good night.

1181
00:51:45,038 --> 00:51:47,040
- And we're clear.
-We're good? Okay.

1182
00:51:47,741 --> 00:51:49,343
Yeah. Oh, yeah,

1183
00:51:49,443 --> 00:51:51,445
I did that already.
Thank you so much, sweetie.

1184
00:51:52,813 --> 00:51:53,814
Okay.

1185
00:51:54,248 --> 00:51:56,250
[indistinct chatter]

1186
00:51:57,117 --> 00:51:59,253
Jimmy, I think we got it.
How you doing?

1187
00:51:59,319 --> 00:52:02,422
-Hi. Zenobia.
-Yes?

1188
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:05,592
It's me, Zane.

1189
00:52:06,426 --> 00:52:08,262
Zane?
Hi, I didn't recognize you.

1190
00:52:08,328 --> 00:52:10,230
You look much ol-- different

1191
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:11,832
from your pictures
on the Internet.

1192
00:52:12,432 --> 00:52:14,101
Yeah, I got to update
my pictures.

1193
00:52:14,835 --> 00:52:16,470
Is that gonna be a problem?

1194
00:52:17,905 --> 00:52:19,506
No. No, it's not.

1195
00:52:19,606 --> 00:52:22,609
-Good.
-So, what's next?

1196
00:52:22,676 --> 00:52:25,345
Uh, well, I was thinking maybe
we could take you home.

1197
00:52:25,445 --> 00:52:28,015
You could change, and then
we could go out to dinner,

1198
00:52:28,115 --> 00:52:29,816
and then maybe later
do a little dancing.

1199
00:52:31,251 --> 00:52:32,553
But why should I change?

1200
00:52:32,653 --> 00:52:35,189
Well, you're just kind of
a little dressy.

1201
00:52:35,289 --> 00:52:37,558
This isn't dressy, is it?

1202
00:52:38,825 --> 00:52:40,661
Uh, well, um,

1203
00:52:41,495 --> 00:52:43,297
maybe it's the red that's
throwing me off.

1204
00:52:46,033 --> 00:52:47,201
You serious?

1205
00:52:49,036 --> 00:52:50,470
Nah, girl, I'm just playing.

1206
00:52:50,537 --> 00:52:52,840
Okay, because I didn't know
what was going on.

1207
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:54,274
Well, you know,
I had you going now.

1208
00:52:54,341 --> 00:52:56,043
-You did. You're funny.
-Yeah, it's cool.

1209
00:52:56,143 --> 00:52:58,111
-So let's go have dinner.
-Yeah, let's go.

1210
00:52:58,178 --> 00:53:00,147
We'll have a nice car
outside for us.

1211
00:53:00,214 --> 00:53:02,416
-Oh, wow. Let me get my things.
-Okay, I'm right behind you.

1212
00:53:05,419 --> 00:53:08,488
-Wow, you got a limo.
-Yeah.

1213
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:13,193
Anything for you, baby.
Your chariot awaits.

1214
00:53:15,896 --> 00:53:16,897
Okay.

1215
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:25,072
[music playing over earphones]

1216
00:53:29,343 --> 00:53:30,878
You just went out last night.

1217
00:53:37,784 --> 00:53:39,253
Okay,
what the hell are you doing?

1218
00:53:40,888 --> 00:53:42,789
You just went out
with the girls last night.

1219
00:53:43,223 --> 00:53:46,159
Do I have to remind you
that you are my husband

1220
00:53:46,226 --> 00:53:47,361
and not my daddy?

1221
00:53:48,862 --> 00:53:52,165
Can we spend at least one night
together at home as a family?

1222
00:53:52,232 --> 00:53:54,368
Okay, you are
such a drama queen.

1223
00:53:54,434 --> 00:53:57,471
We spend a lot of time
together, Phil.

1224
00:53:57,738 --> 00:53:59,439
-A drama queen?
-Yeah.

1225
00:54:04,278 --> 00:54:06,180
Okay, now you pissing me off.

1226
00:54:07,214 --> 00:54:10,517
Coco, you not 17 anymore.
You're a wife and a mother.

1227
00:54:10,717 --> 00:54:11,919
And I have a life.

1228
00:54:13,654 --> 00:54:14,988
Why did you marry me?

1229
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:17,724
[footsteps]

1230
00:54:19,259 --> 00:54:21,195
PJ, go in there and watch TV.
Daddy will be there in a minute.

1231
00:54:21,261 --> 00:54:23,230
Okay, well,
just stop yelling, please.

1232
00:54:23,797 --> 00:54:24,798
[clears throat]

1233
00:54:27,434 --> 00:54:29,069
I hope you were telling me that
because he's in the room,

1234
00:54:29,136 --> 00:54:30,637
not he's the reason
why you married me.

1235
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:34,274
Don't ask questions
if you don't like the answer.

1236
00:54:35,776 --> 00:54:38,212
You didn't have to marry me
because you were pregnant, Coco.

1237
00:54:38,846 --> 00:54:40,948
I didn't sign up
for all this, Phil.

1238
00:54:42,482 --> 00:54:44,384
-Sign up for what?
-This!

1239
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:48,689
These kids,
this marriage, this life!

1240
00:54:51,258 --> 00:54:52,259
Wow.

1241
00:54:54,561 --> 00:54:55,796
Do you love your kids?

1242
00:54:56,129 --> 00:54:57,965
Oh, that's a stupid question.
I had them.

1243
00:54:58,298 --> 00:54:59,833
You haven't bonded
with any of our children.

1244
00:54:59,933 --> 00:55:01,001
They didn't sign up for that.

1245
00:55:02,236 --> 00:55:03,237
[scoffs]

1246
00:55:04,505 --> 00:55:06,340
Um, you know what?

1247
00:55:07,341 --> 00:55:08,709
I'm gonna hurry up

1248
00:55:08,876 --> 00:55:11,478
because my ride is gonna be here
in a minute.

1249
00:55:12,446 --> 00:55:15,782
Uh, you said you never want
To let go

1250
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:19,620
But what are you holding for

1251
00:55:24,491 --> 00:55:26,894
When we both know

1252
00:55:27,361 --> 00:55:30,130
That we are no more

1253
00:55:33,267 --> 00:55:35,869
Uh, I used to close my eyes

1254
00:55:35,969 --> 00:55:39,039
And see the thing
In my dreams

1255
00:55:39,473 --> 00:55:44,611
I used to bow my head and ask
For nothing but good things

1256
00:55:44,745 --> 00:55:46,146
What happened to me

1257
00:55:50,517 --> 00:55:51,919
We got to stay focused.
You know what I'm saying?

1258
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:53,353
He can't play with it.

1259
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:56,924
Hold up, I think I just found
my next baby mama.

1260
00:55:57,024 --> 00:55:58,392
[laughter]

1261
00:55:59,826 --> 00:56:01,628
Yo, what's up, shorty.

1262
00:56:01,695 --> 00:56:03,830
You know you too fine to be
sitting up in here alone.

1263
00:56:04,631 --> 00:56:06,900
I prefer to be left alone
right now.

1264
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,205
-Oh, okay. Well, I just--
-Nick West, I'm a big fan.

1265
00:56:13,073 --> 00:56:15,909
-Will you sign my hat?
-It's cool. Yeah. Yeah.

1266
00:56:16,376 --> 00:56:18,846
Yeah, I, uh, I don't have a pen,

1267
00:56:18,912 --> 00:56:20,714
-player.
-Oh, I got one. I got one.

1268
00:56:23,684 --> 00:56:24,785
All right.

1269
00:56:26,186 --> 00:56:29,489
Hey, so they blew that flagrant
foul call on you, man.

1270
00:56:30,357 --> 00:56:34,695
I wanted to kill those referees,
but I didn't have my gun.

1271
00:56:37,764 --> 00:56:38,799
[laughter]

1272
00:56:38,966 --> 00:56:40,667
He ain't had his gun!

1273
00:56:41,902 --> 00:56:43,403
My man! All right.

1274
00:56:43,504 --> 00:56:45,873
Now, I'd love to talk to you,
man, but as you can see,

1275
00:56:45,939 --> 00:56:47,040
I'm a little bit busy.

1276
00:56:47,774 --> 00:56:50,143
-Oh, my bad.
-Yeah.

1277
00:56:50,244 --> 00:56:51,745
-Hey Nick.
-Huh?

1278
00:56:51,979 --> 00:56:55,682
-Take it to the playoffs, man.
-I'll take you there.

1279
00:56:55,983 --> 00:56:57,384
[laughs]

1280
00:56:59,319 --> 00:57:00,787
Hey, yo, baby. So,

1281
00:57:01,955 --> 00:57:03,991
what's got you
being so mean, girl?

1282
00:57:04,258 --> 00:57:05,259
I don't mean to be rude,

1283
00:57:05,325 --> 00:57:07,227
but I really do not
want to be bothered.

1284
00:57:09,863 --> 00:57:11,064
She don't want to be bothered.

1285
00:57:12,566 --> 00:57:14,968
Okay, well, I'm gonna tell you
what I'm gonna do for you.

1286
00:57:15,302 --> 00:57:17,771
You see, Nick West will buy you
a bottle of whatever you want,

1287
00:57:18,138 --> 00:57:19,173
and I'm gonna just sit with you,

1288
00:57:19,273 --> 00:57:22,476
and you can tell me all about
what that mean man did,

1289
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:24,978
because I'm here for you.

1290
00:57:26,813 --> 00:57:27,881
No thank you.

1291
00:57:29,816 --> 00:57:30,918
"No thank you", huh?

1292
00:57:32,419 --> 00:57:34,288
"No thank you". [laughter]

1293
00:57:35,289 --> 00:57:38,992
Okay, okay, so that's the game
you want to play.

1294
00:57:40,093 --> 00:57:41,295
What game?

1295
00:57:41,361 --> 00:57:45,265
You know, the "I'm not
impressed" game.

1296
00:57:45,933 --> 00:57:47,134
Come on, baby.

1297
00:57:47,201 --> 00:57:48,368
You know I got
a pocketful of money.

1298
00:57:48,468 --> 00:57:49,469
I play for the NBA.

1299
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:52,039
Nick West could have any womens
up in this place I want.

1300
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:56,210
But you want to act
like you unimpressed

1301
00:57:57,211 --> 00:57:58,512
with Nick West.

1302
00:57:59,913 --> 00:58:02,115
Are you looking at yourself
while you're talking to me?

1303
00:58:02,216 --> 00:58:04,384
No, baby,
I ain't looking at myself.

1304
00:58:05,285 --> 00:58:06,954
I'm looking at Nick West.

1305
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:09,289
You might be right.
I'm not impressed.

1306
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:12,492
Okay. All right. It's cool.

1307
00:58:13,126 --> 00:58:17,297
I ain't tripping because I done
seen this show before, baby.

1308
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,069
Are you this stupid every day,

1309
00:58:22,169 --> 00:58:24,872
or did you make
a special attempt for today?

1310
00:58:25,239 --> 00:58:27,875
You know, I actually saw you
being interviewed on TV,

1311
00:58:28,375 --> 00:58:30,344
and watching you
was embarrassing.

1312
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:32,079
-Embarrassing?
-Embarrassing.

1313
00:58:32,312 --> 00:58:34,481
Hold up, now.
Who you talking to?

1314
00:58:35,215 --> 00:58:36,650
Nick West.

1315
00:58:36,717 --> 00:58:40,320
I want to know, why is it
every time that I see you on TV,

1316
00:58:40,387 --> 00:58:43,023
you talk like some runaway
field hand from the hood?

1317
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:44,691
-Runaway field?
-So back to me

1318
00:58:44,791 --> 00:58:47,394
being unimpressed? Uh, yeah.

1319
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:51,632
You got me twisted, shorty.

1320
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:54,067
That's all right, baby.
Go ahead.

1321
00:58:54,168 --> 00:58:56,036
Play lotto, but don't play me.
You might win.

1322
00:58:56,103 --> 00:58:58,539
See, Nick West hadn't bought
smarter tricks

1323
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:00,574
than dance on a pole
for a living, baby.

1324
00:59:00,674 --> 00:59:02,109
-Really? Really?
-Here, I'm gonna make it rain.

1325
00:59:02,209 --> 00:59:03,577
-Just like that.
-Here, why don't you...

1326
00:59:03,677 --> 00:59:05,445
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1327
00:59:13,554 --> 00:59:15,422
You're not worth
my glass of wine.

1328
00:59:15,522 --> 00:59:16,657
Good night, fellas.

1329
00:59:17,724 --> 00:59:19,092
Yeah, it could have been
a good night.

1330
00:59:29,837 --> 00:59:30,838
Um,

1331
00:59:30,904 --> 00:59:31,939
you know what you want?

1332
00:59:32,372 --> 00:59:34,041
No, everything looks so good.

1333
00:59:34,107 --> 00:59:35,309
Everything here is great.

1334
00:59:36,543 --> 00:59:37,778
Thank you for agreeing
to go out with me.

1335
00:59:37,878 --> 00:59:40,314
-It's a beautiful restaurant.
-It's great.

1336
00:59:40,414 --> 00:59:42,449
-Hi, I'm Zane.
-Ah, pleasure to meet you, sir.

1337
00:59:42,549 --> 00:59:44,718
And this is my, uh,
date, Zenobia.

1338
00:59:45,085 --> 00:59:46,587
You recognize her
from the sports show?

1339
00:59:46,653 --> 00:59:48,021
-I didn't want to say anything,
-Zane!

1340
00:59:48,088 --> 00:59:49,556
-but it's okay.
-Isn't she beautiful?

1341
00:59:49,623 --> 00:59:50,657
-She is.
-Guys!

1342
00:59:50,757 --> 00:59:52,326
-What?
-I'm just saying, you are.

1343
00:59:52,426 --> 00:59:53,861
I'm sorry, got off the subject.

1344
00:59:54,228 --> 00:59:56,797
Um, this escar-got

1345
00:59:57,931 --> 00:59:59,099
looks very interesting.

1346
00:59:59,333 --> 01:00:00,634
What exactly is it?

1347
01:00:01,268 --> 01:00:02,436
You mean escargot?

1348
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:06,340
-It's snails.
-Yeah, snails.

1349
01:00:08,342 --> 01:00:09,576
I believe I just said that.

1350
01:00:11,945 --> 01:00:13,747
Actually, I just need
your drink order first.

1351
01:00:13,814 --> 01:00:15,082
Ma'am, what will you have?

1352
01:00:15,148 --> 01:00:17,684
I think I'll have
a glass of wine.

1353
01:00:19,486 --> 01:00:22,523
You should try the Cabernet.
She's gonna take the Cabernet.

1354
01:00:25,325 --> 01:00:29,229
I could get you
a Cabernet, Chardonnay,

1355
01:00:29,296 --> 01:00:30,531
Riesling, anything you'd like.

1356
01:00:30,631 --> 01:00:32,266
I'll just have the house
white wine.

1357
01:00:32,332 --> 01:00:36,069
-Okay.
-That's a great choice.

1358
01:00:36,503 --> 01:00:39,072
A friend ordered a couple
of cases of the house white wine

1359
01:00:39,139 --> 01:00:41,175
from Italy last year.
Great, they loved it.

1360
01:00:42,075 --> 01:00:43,443
I actually have two
to choose from.

1361
01:00:43,544 --> 01:00:44,778
-Either one is fine.
-Okay.

1362
01:00:49,616 --> 01:00:52,252
Where is your, uh,
list for your beers?

1363
01:00:52,486 --> 01:00:53,720
On the back of the menu.

1364
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:55,656
Uh, you'll see that we have
a wide range of beers

1365
01:00:55,722 --> 01:00:56,723
from around the world.

1366
01:00:57,191 --> 01:00:58,192
Oh.

1367
01:00:58,992 --> 01:01:00,961
Mm, I'm not so sure about that.

1368
01:01:01,962 --> 01:01:04,031
Where are your malt liquors?

1369
01:01:06,967 --> 01:01:08,101
Malt liquors?

1370
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:10,704
Yeah, you know, like Schlitz,

1371
01:01:10,804 --> 01:01:12,472
Old English,
that's from London.

1372
01:01:12,973 --> 01:01:14,274
-Thank you.
-Colt 45.

1373
01:01:15,008 --> 01:01:18,378
I... none.
What you see is what we have.

1374
01:01:20,981 --> 01:01:24,051
Okay, well, uh, if you don't
have any malt liquors,

1375
01:01:24,151 --> 01:01:27,020
I'll try, um...
What's this?

1376
01:01:27,154 --> 01:01:29,590
I think I'm gonna try
the Negro Modlo.

1377
01:01:31,124 --> 01:01:33,727
I happen to know that's
manufactured by a black company.

1378
01:01:33,827 --> 01:01:35,829
It's Negro Modelo.

1379
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:38,131
It's a Mexican beer.

1380
01:01:38,498 --> 01:01:40,667
-[gasps] Oh!
-I'm gonna go.

1381
01:01:40,734 --> 01:01:42,302
-Gracias.
-De nada.

1382
01:01:43,537 --> 01:01:46,039
Mexican. I didn't know that.

1383
01:01:57,518 --> 01:02:00,320
I'm not some jump-off.
I'm your wife.

1384
01:02:02,422 --> 01:02:04,324
The real reason I don't want
to have a baby with you

1385
01:02:04,391 --> 01:02:05,459
is because...

1386
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:08,862
I don't know how long
I'm gonna be married to you.

1387
01:02:11,798 --> 01:02:13,800
[sentimental music]

1388
01:02:34,087 --> 01:02:35,189
You sure you don't want any?

1389
01:02:35,722 --> 01:02:38,559
This is J Rocket, some of
the best champagne ever.

1390
01:02:38,992 --> 01:02:41,094
No, thank you.

1391
01:02:42,362 --> 01:02:43,597
I want you to listen
to something.

1392
01:02:43,664 --> 01:02:46,633
-Okay.
[loud hip-hop music]

1393
01:02:47,434 --> 01:02:49,002
All my boys on the corner

1394
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:53,240
Zane, could we just turn it
down just a little bit?

1395
01:02:54,541 --> 01:02:55,976
Here's the good part.
Here's the good part.

1396
01:02:56,076 --> 01:02:57,211
The river runs deep

1397
01:02:57,277 --> 01:02:59,012
In a land once inhabited

1398
01:02:59,112 --> 01:03:00,247
by a few
[sings along] By a few.

1399
01:03:00,848 --> 01:03:02,449
The path was dead

1400
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:04,218
As I noticed

1401
01:03:04,284 --> 01:03:06,220
The morning dew
[sings along] The morning dew.

1402
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:09,590
Transparency was the order
Of the day

1403
01:03:09,656 --> 01:03:11,992
Wrapped in a blanket
Is where life lays

1404
01:03:13,493 --> 01:03:15,562
There's the light of the sun

1405
01:03:16,263 --> 01:03:18,131
And the smoke from a gun
And the smoke from a gun.

1406
01:03:18,999 --> 01:03:20,968
He's telling him to put
The package to sleep

1407
01:03:21,034 --> 01:03:24,171
In the middle of the river
Where it runs deep

1408
01:03:24,404 --> 01:03:27,608
Y'all are not ready ever

1409
01:03:27,674 --> 01:03:29,443
Y'all are not ready ever

1410
01:03:29,643 --> 01:03:32,579
-That sound familiar?
-No.

1411
01:03:33,146 --> 01:03:35,816
Is it possible that we could
turn it down

1412
01:03:35,883 --> 01:03:37,251
just a little bit, though?

1413
01:03:38,118 --> 01:03:39,353
[music turns off]
Thank you.

1414
01:03:40,254 --> 01:03:42,689
That's that's from the poem
I read you the other day.

1415
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:48,328
Oh. Nice.

1416
01:03:51,131 --> 01:03:53,033
[sighs] Oh.

1417
01:03:55,636 --> 01:03:57,437
It's getting really late,
you know?

1418
01:03:57,504 --> 01:03:58,906
Maybe I should be getting home.

1419
01:03:59,006 --> 01:04:00,541
Well, we're almost at the party.

1420
01:04:01,074 --> 01:04:03,343
The party? [clears throat]
I thought

1421
01:04:03,443 --> 01:04:05,445
You said something
about a club, maybe.

1422
01:04:06,013 --> 01:04:08,148
Yeah, I was thinking that,
but clubs are so weird

1423
01:04:08,215 --> 01:04:09,616
and so strange out here.

1424
01:04:09,683 --> 01:04:11,919
One of my best friends
is having a nice house party.

1425
01:04:16,456 --> 01:04:18,892
Uh-oh. We almost here.
I can see the people walking up.

1426
01:04:20,694 --> 01:04:21,995
Limo, pull over right here.

1427
01:04:22,462 --> 01:04:24,464
[faint hip-hop music]

1428
01:04:25,098 --> 01:04:26,099
[laughs]

1429
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:28,202
-You're gonna love this.
-[exhales sharply]

1430
01:04:28,302 --> 01:04:29,403
You're gonna love this.

1431
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:31,371
...D R-A-T

1432
01:04:31,471 --> 01:04:33,373
Because that's the only shawty
For me

1433
01:04:33,473 --> 01:04:37,211
I said I need
A H-O-O-D R-A-T

1434
01:04:38,245 --> 01:04:39,880
Zane, you have to take me home
right now.

1435
01:04:40,414 --> 01:04:42,416
Oh, come on, Zenobia.
We just got here.

1436
01:04:42,950 --> 01:04:44,351
This is one
of my buddy's parties.

1437
01:04:44,418 --> 01:04:46,186
-It's gonna be nice.
-There's Zane!

1438
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,755
Oh, what up!
What up, man!

1439
01:04:48,856 --> 01:04:51,725
Oh, man.
How you feeling, man?

1440
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:54,561
[indistinct conversation]

1441
01:04:55,028 --> 01:04:57,231
-You know how we do it, baby.
-Hey, hey, who's the hottie?

1442
01:04:57,331 --> 01:04:59,499
Oh, yeah. This is my little
homegirl, Zenobia.

1443
01:04:59,566 --> 01:05:00,567
We been hanging out.

1444
01:05:00,667 --> 01:05:01,935
We about to be an item,
you know what I mean?

1445
01:05:02,035 --> 01:05:03,570
We having a great time.
She's nice.

1446
01:05:04,538 --> 01:05:07,574
You know how I do it, boy.
She keeps it sexy, boy.

1447
01:05:07,975 --> 01:05:10,744
Hey, hey, you know.
Hey, hey, check it out.

1448
01:05:10,811 --> 01:05:11,945
Check it out.
Check it out.

1449
01:05:12,145 --> 01:05:14,715
Homegirl be doing sports on TV.

1450
01:05:14,781 --> 01:05:16,283
-Oh, yeah?
-You know what I'm saying?

1451
01:05:17,084 --> 01:05:18,218
You got plenty of game.

1452
01:05:18,285 --> 01:05:19,286
-She got game, boy.
-Yeah, I can see that.

1453
01:05:19,386 --> 01:05:21,054
Hey, yo, yo.
How your little brother doing?

1454
01:05:21,121 --> 01:05:22,556
Oh, man. They had to leave

1455
01:05:22,623 --> 01:05:25,292
the bullet in, man,
but he gonna be okay, man.

1456
01:05:25,392 --> 01:05:27,327
No. Man, I'm sorry
to hear that, dawg.

1457
01:05:27,427 --> 01:05:28,962
It's all good, man.
It's all good, baby.

1458
01:05:29,062 --> 01:05:30,430
Hey, yo, me and this man
right here,

1459
01:05:30,531 --> 01:05:32,633
yo, I ain't seen him
since we did time.

1460
01:05:34,434 --> 01:05:36,703
Did he say time together, Zane?

1461
01:05:36,803 --> 01:05:39,640
Are you wearing red?
[music stops] Hey!

1462
01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:42,309
I need to know why this bitch
is wearing red.

1463
01:05:43,577 --> 01:05:45,579
[silence]

1464
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:53,320
Hey, you Piru?

1465
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:55,255
-She ain't no Piru.
-Did she just call me a bitch?

1466
01:05:55,322 --> 01:05:56,456
She didn't stutter.

1467
01:05:56,557 --> 01:05:57,891
You about to take a knee, slob.

1468
01:05:57,958 --> 01:05:59,927
-Yo, yo, hold up.
-I am not a slob. I'm actually--

1469
01:06:05,766 --> 01:06:10,204
You know, you didn't have
to cut my ponytail, okay?

1470
01:06:11,638 --> 01:06:13,674
It was clip-on.

1471
01:06:16,577 --> 01:06:19,446
-I didn't know.
-You didn't know?

1472
01:06:19,513 --> 01:06:21,348
tried to save
some of your hair, though.

1473
01:06:22,049 --> 01:06:25,219
Just take me
to the station, please.

1474
01:06:27,688 --> 01:06:29,523
I told you that red dress
wasn't working.

1475
01:06:31,859 --> 01:06:33,060
You were locked up?

1476
01:06:35,696 --> 01:06:39,399
Yeah, but I told you that.
It's not like I lied.

1477
01:06:39,499 --> 01:06:42,503
Just, you know what? Don't talk.

1478
01:06:49,409 --> 01:06:50,410
[car honks]

1479
01:06:52,946 --> 01:06:55,682
I, um, I personally thought
we had a great time tonight.

1480
01:06:56,149 --> 01:06:57,684
-You think we can hook up again?
-[sighs]

1481
01:06:58,051 --> 01:07:00,354
-You're kidding, right?
-Why?

1482
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:03,490
Because that is never
going to happen.

1483
01:07:03,557 --> 01:07:05,893
Well, I thought we had a great
time except for the altercation.

1484
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:07,961
-Are we here?
-Are you saying

1485
01:07:08,028 --> 01:07:09,029
we're never
gonna get together again?

1486
01:07:09,096 --> 01:07:10,631
-Never, ever.
-Ever?

1487
01:07:10,697 --> 01:07:11,698
Never.

1488
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,169
-What happened?
-Excuse me.

1489
01:07:15,435 --> 01:07:17,437
-Can I ask you a favor?
-What?

1490
01:07:18,205 --> 01:07:19,806
You want to buy
some of my mixtapes?

1491
01:07:22,075 --> 01:07:24,745
Huh? Hey, look here.

1492
01:07:25,812 --> 01:07:29,116
I usually sell these for $30,
but I give you a deal for $15.

1493
01:07:29,516 --> 01:07:33,086
All right. Look, I'll throw
this whole thing in for $22.50.

1494
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:34,721
Victoria.
[Zane continues indistinctly]

1495
01:07:34,821 --> 01:07:37,558
This was the date
from hell, okay?

1496
01:07:37,925 --> 01:07:40,360
He was, like, a 50-year-old
gangster, closer to 60.

1497
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:41,929
I thought we were
going to a club,

1498
01:07:42,029 --> 01:07:43,530
-maybe a little dinner, but no.
-[Zane continues in background]

1499
01:07:43,597 --> 01:07:45,132
We end up at a house party,
and I'm wearing re--

1500
01:07:45,732 --> 01:07:46,733
What's wrong?

1501
01:07:48,135 --> 01:07:49,136
What?

1502
01:07:50,838 --> 01:07:52,472
Look, why you crying?

1503
01:07:53,373 --> 01:07:56,009
Okay, I'm gonna get in a cab,
and I'll be there in a second.

1504
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:58,212
-Okay? Okay.
-I tell you what I'm gonna do.

1505
01:07:58,278 --> 01:08:00,013
I'm gonna give you
the whole collection,

1506
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:02,316
-All right. Bye-bye.
-gonna give it to you for $10.

1507
01:08:02,683 --> 01:08:05,052
Hey, hey, how about you just
buy this shirt for $5?

1508
01:08:05,118 --> 01:08:06,620
Okay. Look, I'll give you
the whole

1509
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:10,257
the tennis shoes, the T-shirt,
and the CDs [voice fades out]

1510
01:08:15,295 --> 01:08:17,931
I mean, I know
I packed his clothes up,

1511
01:08:18,031 --> 01:08:19,800
but I didn't expect him
to leave.

1512
01:08:20,901 --> 01:08:22,936
He's probably just angry.
He'll come back.

1513
01:08:23,403 --> 01:08:26,673
I mean, is it so wrong to wanna
have a baby with your husband?

1514
01:08:26,907 --> 01:08:29,042
No, not at all.

1515
01:08:29,443 --> 01:08:31,645
Hell, I'm gonna have to go
down to Cleavon's sperm bank

1516
01:08:31,745 --> 01:08:34,047
and get a donation
at the rate I'm going.

1517
01:08:35,349 --> 01:08:36,783
You mean the science

1518
01:08:36,884 --> 01:08:38,752
-Reproductive science center.
-...reproductive center.

1519
01:08:38,819 --> 01:08:40,754
[laughter] Oh, no, no, no.

1520
01:08:41,588 --> 01:08:42,656
-Sperm bank.
-Sperm bank.

1521
01:08:45,459 --> 01:08:49,329
Girl, you look a mess.
Was he really a gangster?

1522
01:08:49,429 --> 01:08:50,430
He was in prison.

1523
01:08:51,098 --> 01:08:53,000
It didn't say that
on soulmates.com.

1524
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:55,169
They were
crip-walking at the party.

1525
01:08:55,269 --> 01:08:57,538
Oh, not the crip-walking
at the party.

1526
01:08:57,638 --> 01:08:59,273
We gonna have to find you
another guy.

1527
01:08:59,339 --> 01:09:03,443
No, no, no. All right?
We're not doing that again.

1528
01:09:05,646 --> 01:09:08,182
Everybody is getting married,
having babies.

1529
01:09:09,483 --> 01:09:12,719
At least we got Phil's kids,
which reminds me

1530
01:09:12,819 --> 01:09:15,088
I have to text him to see
if I can get them tomorrow.

1531
01:09:15,389 --> 01:09:17,157
Wait a minute.
Who's getting married?

1532
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:20,260
-Shavelle.
-[gasps]

1533
01:09:20,527 --> 01:09:23,730
You're kidding. Shavelle?

1534
01:09:24,531 --> 01:09:26,834
-Shavelle. [chuckles]
-Oh, my God.

1535
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:29,203
I mean, if Shavelle
can find somebody,

1536
01:09:29,303 --> 01:09:31,104
I don't see why it's so hard
for me to find somebody.

1537
01:09:31,471 --> 01:09:33,807
P.S. by the way, she's having
a bachelorette party next week,

1538
01:09:33,874 --> 01:09:34,975
and we're invited.

1539
01:09:35,943 --> 01:09:36,944
Yay.

1540
01:09:38,745 --> 01:09:40,013
-[sighs]
-You know what?

1541
01:09:40,747 --> 01:09:43,884
[sighs] Austin's phone keeps
going to voicemail.

1542
01:09:43,984 --> 01:09:45,352
-I'm gonna try it one more time.
-Hey, hey.

1543
01:09:48,055 --> 01:09:49,523
Give him some time to calm down.

1544
01:09:51,592 --> 01:09:54,528
-Come here.
-[pained sigh] Oh.

1545
01:09:57,164 --> 01:09:59,132
[playground noise]

1546
01:10:04,037 --> 01:10:06,907
PJ, PJ, don't go
too far, buddy.

1547
01:10:07,741 --> 01:10:08,876
Be careful, sweetie.

1548
01:10:11,345 --> 01:10:14,081
Oh, God.
I just love this little girl.

1549
01:10:14,748 --> 01:10:16,383
I love her so much.

1550
01:10:17,784 --> 01:10:19,753
Phil. Phil.

1551
01:10:21,188 --> 01:10:22,589
What's going on with you?

1552
01:10:22,689 --> 01:10:24,191
-Nothing.
-Oh, come on.

1553
01:10:25,025 --> 01:10:26,193
I know when something
is not right.

1554
01:10:28,462 --> 01:10:29,997
It's really nothing, okay?

1555
01:10:31,632 --> 01:10:34,401
You're not happy.
I can see it in your eyes.

1556
01:10:34,468 --> 01:10:36,470
[somber music]

1557
01:10:40,474 --> 01:10:41,775
It's just tough, you know?

1558
01:10:42,709 --> 01:10:44,778
I mean, I cannot
make her be a mama.

1559
01:10:48,382 --> 01:10:53,453
So I'm trying to be strong
for the kids, and, uh...

1560
01:10:56,623 --> 01:10:58,725
You know, Victoria and Austin
are going through it, too.

1561
01:10:59,927 --> 01:11:01,228
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

1562
01:11:01,295 --> 01:11:03,830
We're gonna go over there
tonight, all of us.

1563
01:11:04,565 --> 01:11:06,767
I called Cleavon already.
You want to come?

1564
01:11:07,134 --> 01:11:08,669
Yeah.
I'll drop the kids off at Mom's.

1565
01:11:08,769 --> 01:11:09,770
Okay.

1566
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:13,574
-Hey, bubba.
-Zen.

1567
01:11:14,007 --> 01:11:15,108
Huh?

1568
01:11:16,009 --> 01:11:17,411
Thanks for listening.

1569
01:11:17,477 --> 01:11:19,680
What?
What are you thanking me for?

1570
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:23,116
That's what friends do.
You know?

1571
01:11:24,585 --> 01:11:25,586
Ow.

1572
01:11:27,421 --> 01:11:28,555
Come home.

1573
01:11:29,456 --> 01:11:30,924
Vic, we need a break.

1574
01:11:31,391 --> 01:11:34,294
I mean,
these last couple of days,

1575
01:11:34,394 --> 01:11:35,963
I've been able
to clear my head and

1576
01:11:36,663 --> 01:11:37,998
I've really needed to do that.

1577
01:11:40,033 --> 01:11:41,568
I'm not gonna pressure you
to do anything

1578
01:11:41,635 --> 01:11:42,836
you don't want to do, baby,

1579
01:11:42,936 --> 01:11:44,471
just please come home.

1580
01:11:45,272 --> 01:11:46,807
I'm not ready to come home.

1581
01:11:47,808 --> 01:11:48,842
Why?

1582
01:11:48,942 --> 01:11:49,977
I told you why.

1583
01:11:50,944 --> 01:11:52,145
Where are you staying?

1584
01:11:52,246 --> 01:11:53,247
At a hotel.

1585
01:11:56,116 --> 01:11:57,684
Just until I can find
something permanent.

1586
01:11:59,253 --> 01:12:02,055
Permanent? Austin,
you don't need to do this.

1587
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:06,593
Why not?
Baby, you packed my bags.

1588
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:09,329
I know, but do you remember
what you said to me?

1589
01:12:11,131 --> 01:12:12,132
Yeah.

1590
01:12:12,199 --> 01:12:15,202
You told me that you didn't
want to have kids with me

1591
01:12:15,302 --> 01:12:17,604
because you didn't know how long
you gonna stay married to me.

1592
01:12:21,074 --> 01:12:23,076
And I still don't know
the answer to that question.

1593
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:29,082
God, what have we been doing
the last three years

1594
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:30,717
of our lives, Austin?

1595
01:12:30,817 --> 01:12:32,653
Arguing about having a baby.

1596
01:12:33,287 --> 01:12:34,721
Look, I don't want kids
right now,

1597
01:12:34,821 --> 01:12:36,356
and I don't know when
I'm gonna want them.

1598
01:12:38,992 --> 01:12:41,361
Why didn't you say something
before we got married?

1599
01:12:42,162 --> 01:12:45,032
I did.
Baby, you weren't listening.

1600
01:12:48,001 --> 01:12:50,737
Austin, just come home
so we can work this out.

1601
01:12:50,838 --> 01:12:52,506
I'm not coming home.
I mean,

1602
01:12:53,941 --> 01:12:55,943
I'll be by tomorrow
to get the rest of my stuff.

1603
01:12:56,777 --> 01:12:58,912
Baby, why are you
doing this to me?

1604
01:13:00,113 --> 01:13:02,950
I don't understand, Austin.
Why are you doing this to us?

1605
01:13:04,585 --> 01:13:07,487
-I'm getting off the phone now.
-Austin, don't get off.

1606
01:13:08,088 --> 01:13:10,090
Austin, do not get
off this phone.

1607
01:13:12,326 --> 01:13:13,327
Hello?

1608
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:19,132
[somber piano chords]

1609
01:13:19,666 --> 01:13:20,667
Oh.

1610
01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:24,771
[cries]

1611
01:13:28,075 --> 01:13:29,209
Come on.

1612
01:13:31,678 --> 01:13:34,281
Plow! Woo-loo-loo-loo.

1613
01:13:34,381 --> 01:13:36,884
Stop playing! Come on.
[laughter]

1614
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:37,951
Bloop!

1615
01:13:38,619 --> 01:13:39,853
-You know what, Harold?
-Okay.

1616
01:13:42,956 --> 01:13:44,958
[makes creaking noise]

1617
01:13:45,926 --> 01:13:48,328
-Really? Seriously?
-What?

1618
01:13:49,263 --> 01:13:52,065
That ain't no diamond.
That's a chip of a diamond.

1619
01:13:52,599 --> 01:13:54,001
Girl, this ain't no chip
of a diamond.

1620
01:13:54,101 --> 01:13:55,169
This is a real diamond.

1621
01:13:55,269 --> 01:13:57,437
That's a piece of a diamond.
That ain't no diamond.

1622
01:13:58,105 --> 01:14:01,241
-Ah, man, you that ungrateful?
-Are you serious?

1623
01:14:01,942 --> 01:14:03,410
Are you really serious?

1624
01:14:04,077 --> 01:14:06,914
It's come from Africa.
It's a Sierre Leone "salarium."

1625
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:08,448
You can't even say what it is.

1626
01:14:09,716 --> 01:14:10,984
-Check this out.
-What?

1627
01:14:11,084 --> 01:14:12,953
You wanted to get married.
We getting married.

1628
01:14:13,453 --> 01:14:15,556
Then you wanted a ring.
You got the ring.

1629
01:14:15,622 --> 01:14:17,558
What else a man
gotta do for you?

1630
01:14:17,624 --> 01:14:19,259
-You know what? Get your jacket.
-Huh?

1631
01:14:19,893 --> 01:14:20,928
Get your coat. Come on.

1632
01:14:24,031 --> 01:14:25,732
-Where we going?
-We gonna take that ring

1633
01:14:25,799 --> 01:14:26,967
-back where you got it from.

1634
01:14:28,335 --> 01:14:29,770
Walmart close at 10:00.

1635
01:14:34,007 --> 01:14:35,576
Oh, you bought my ring
at Walmart?

1636
01:14:35,742 --> 01:14:37,311
You bought my ring at Walmart?!

1637
01:14:40,948 --> 01:14:42,950
[tranquil music]

1638
01:14:46,186 --> 01:14:48,355
Let's just talk about
pleasant things.

1639
01:14:48,655 --> 01:14:49,990
Okay. [clears throat]

1640
01:14:52,492 --> 01:14:54,595
I got something.
You remember when we were kids,

1641
01:14:54,661 --> 01:14:56,864
we used to give you such
a hard time about being so tall?

1642
01:14:57,464 --> 01:14:58,866
And you could never catch us.

1643
01:15:01,001 --> 01:15:02,970
I'm glad y'all caught up
with me in height, though.

1644
01:15:04,404 --> 01:15:07,341
Well, not everybody.

1645
01:15:08,041 --> 01:15:09,810
Y'all just had a crush
on me anyway.

1646
01:15:09,877 --> 01:15:13,046
Uh, ew, no, not us. Phil did.

1647
01:15:13,146 --> 01:15:15,215
-I did not. Not.
-Phil, you did, Phil.

1648
01:15:16,884 --> 01:15:20,420
I remember a time
during prom season.

1649
01:15:20,521 --> 01:15:21,522
Damn it. I gotta go pee.

1650
01:15:21,622 --> 01:15:23,357
Why are you always drinking
so much water?

1651
01:15:23,423 --> 01:15:27,027
-Because it's a part of my job.
-It's not a job, Cleavon.

1652
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:29,396
Oh, it's not a job? Huh?
Then what's this?

1653
01:15:29,863 --> 01:15:31,565
It's a check. From where?

1654
01:15:31,665 --> 01:15:34,401
From the Reproductive
Science Center where I work.

1655
01:15:34,868 --> 01:15:36,170
It's a sperm bank.

1656
01:15:36,236 --> 01:15:38,372
Okay. You know, you're gonna get
my check wet, man.

1657
01:15:39,573 --> 01:15:41,341
Yo, stop minimizing
what I do, y'all.

1658
01:15:41,408 --> 01:15:42,643
-Sorry.
-I'm serious.

1659
01:15:42,709 --> 01:15:45,078
Okay.
Can I please finish my story?

1660
01:15:45,179 --> 01:15:46,880
-Yes.
-Fine, go ahead.

1661
01:15:47,748 --> 01:15:49,449
Phil did the sweetest thing.

1662
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:51,518
Oh, gosh. Do we...

1663
01:15:51,585 --> 01:15:53,987
How many times
have we heard this story?

1664
01:15:54,855 --> 01:15:56,390
It was so sweet.

1665
01:15:56,456 --> 01:16:00,093
Phil could have taken the most
popular girl in high school,

1666
01:16:00,194 --> 01:16:02,462
-You know I could have, too.
-[both girls] Cynthia Arseno.

1667
01:16:03,197 --> 01:16:06,900
But instead, he took Zenobia,
and that, to me,

1668
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:11,205
was the ultimate gesture
of love and friendship.

1669
01:16:12,439 --> 01:16:17,277
Nobody wanted to take me
because I was, I was...

1670
01:16:17,377 --> 01:16:18,478
So damn tall.

1671
01:16:18,912 --> 01:16:20,080
-Shut up!
-Okay, now, look.

1672
01:16:20,147 --> 01:16:21,582
-Why?
-Now, look.

1673
01:16:21,882 --> 01:16:23,650
-Why?
-I'm just calling it as it was.

1674
01:16:24,484 --> 01:16:25,886
-All right.
-Let's stop.

1675
01:16:25,953 --> 01:16:26,954
I thought y'all said
we was gonna talk

1676
01:16:27,054 --> 01:16:28,088
about something
more pleasant anyway.

1677
01:16:28,188 --> 01:16:29,189
That's right. We said that.

1678
01:16:29,323 --> 01:16:30,324
I'll tell you what.

1679
01:16:30,457 --> 01:16:32,893
Right now, I want to perform
a toast. Let's go.

1680
01:16:33,293 --> 01:16:34,494
Everybody,
let's get your glasses.

1681
01:16:35,262 --> 01:16:36,263
-Toast.
-This is serious.

1682
01:16:36,330 --> 01:16:37,331
-I'll get it.
-Okay.

1683
01:16:38,932 --> 01:16:40,334
-[sighs]
-Everybody,

1684
01:16:40,467 --> 01:16:41,468
-glasses up.

1685
01:16:42,936 --> 01:16:44,338
You gonna toast
with the jug, bruh?

1686
01:16:44,905 --> 01:16:45,906
To friends for life.

1687
01:16:45,973 --> 01:16:47,574
-[all] Friends for life.

1688
01:16:52,112 --> 01:16:53,514
-I thought you had to go pee.

1689
01:16:54,281 --> 01:16:55,682
I did, but I don't have
to go no more.

1690
01:16:57,951 --> 01:17:00,287
What?
Oh, come on.

1691
01:17:01,221 --> 01:17:04,358
Now come on, y'all.
I didn't...

1692
01:17:04,591 --> 01:17:06,360
Y'all just gonna assume
that I did it here?

1693
01:17:07,628 --> 01:17:08,929
Y'all are something else.

1694
01:17:11,965 --> 01:17:13,767
-We need to talk.
-I'm running late, Coco.

1695
01:17:13,901 --> 01:17:16,303
I think you need to hear
what I have to say.

1696
01:17:20,307 --> 01:17:21,942
Okay. What's going on, Coco?

1697
01:17:24,244 --> 01:17:25,479
I'm not happy.

1698
01:17:30,117 --> 01:17:32,119
[reflective music]

1699
01:17:34,121 --> 01:17:36,023
Has he been around my kids?

1700
01:17:36,123 --> 01:17:37,124
No.

1701
01:17:42,529 --> 01:17:43,664
Who is he?

1702
01:17:44,097 --> 01:17:45,165
That doesn't matter.

1703
01:17:45,666 --> 01:17:46,800
You love this person?

1704
01:17:48,268 --> 01:17:50,470
-Yeah.
-Are you in love with him?

1705
01:17:51,171 --> 01:17:53,273
I'm pretty sure so, yeah.

1706
01:17:58,645 --> 01:18:01,582
You expect me to just pack
my clothes and leave my kids?

1707
01:18:02,683 --> 01:18:04,852
No. Mnh-mnh.

1708
01:18:08,755 --> 01:18:09,756
I'm leaving.

1709
01:18:13,427 --> 01:18:14,995
-You're leaving?
-Yeah.

1710
01:18:16,563 --> 01:18:17,731
I need to know
where you're taking my kids.

1711
01:18:17,831 --> 01:18:18,999
I'm not taking them.

1712
01:18:19,533 --> 01:18:21,502
I mean, they're gonna stay here
with you.

1713
01:18:24,872 --> 01:18:26,707
You would abandon your kids
for a man?

1714
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:29,443
Yeah. See, that's what, um,
I want to talk to you about

1715
01:18:29,543 --> 01:18:32,079
because I want to be able
to talk to them and see them

1716
01:18:32,179 --> 01:18:34,348
and, you know, hang out
with them from time to time.

1717
01:18:34,548 --> 01:18:36,216
You know what I'm saying, so.

1718
01:18:38,218 --> 01:18:40,220
[music continues]

1719
01:18:41,622 --> 01:18:43,423
That's very considerate of you.

1720
01:18:44,725 --> 01:18:48,395
Phil, you're the better parent.
They should be here with you.

1721
01:18:48,896 --> 01:18:49,897
Where are you gonna stay?

1722
01:18:50,197 --> 01:18:51,398
I'm moving in with him.

1723
01:18:53,367 --> 01:18:54,368
[scoffs]

1724
01:18:56,603 --> 01:18:57,938
-You're moving in with him.
-Yeah.

1725
01:18:58,038 --> 01:18:59,273
Who is him? Who is he?

1726
01:18:59,873 --> 01:19:03,710
I mean, is knowing really
gonna make

1727
01:19:03,777 --> 01:19:05,946
that big
of a difference to you?

1728
01:19:06,046 --> 01:19:07,881
Yeah, I need to know who my
children are gonna be around.

1729
01:19:09,449 --> 01:19:11,952
Really? Um.

1730
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:15,122
He plays in the NBA.

1731
01:19:18,225 --> 01:19:20,460
You leaving your family
for a professional athlete?

1732
01:19:20,561 --> 01:19:22,996
Yeah.
Is that a problem with you?

1733
01:19:24,364 --> 01:19:25,399
Who is he?

1734
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:29,536
-Nick West. Yeah.
-Nick West.

1735
01:19:29,636 --> 01:19:30,904
He's the biggest whore
in the NBA.

1736
01:19:30,971 --> 01:19:32,906
What? You don't even know
anything about him.

1737
01:19:33,073 --> 01:19:34,775
You would leave your family
for him?

1738
01:19:36,376 --> 01:19:37,678
He loves me.

1739
01:19:43,116 --> 01:19:44,651
Are you sure about that, Coco?

1740
01:19:46,553 --> 01:19:48,856
Well, he loves me enough
to want me to move in with him.

1741
01:19:48,956 --> 01:19:49,957
Excuse me.

1742
01:19:51,425 --> 01:19:53,861
So you just leave your marriage
and your kids

1743
01:19:54,795 --> 01:19:57,497
just like that?
What does that say about you?

1744
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:02,603
He provides a lifestyle
that I deserve.

1745
01:20:03,437 --> 01:20:05,506
He makes more money waking up
in the morning

1746
01:20:05,606 --> 01:20:08,408
than you do delivering water
for a whole year,

1747
01:20:08,475 --> 01:20:10,277
and what, Phil?

1748
01:20:11,411 --> 01:20:12,713
How about that?

1749
01:20:20,354 --> 01:20:23,123
-When are you leaving?
-This afternoon.

1750
01:20:23,190 --> 01:20:24,191
That's not enough time for me

1751
01:20:24,291 --> 01:20:25,959
to find someone
to watch my children.

1752
01:20:26,293 --> 01:20:28,529
What?
My sister can take care of them.

1753
01:20:30,163 --> 01:20:33,267
Your sister does crack.
Remember?

1754
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:36,470
Oh, well, your papers
are on the dresser.

1755
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:43,143
That's the divorce papers,
by the way, and Phil,

1756
01:20:43,210 --> 01:20:46,480
trust, like,
I don't want anything from you.

1757
01:20:47,214 --> 01:20:52,319
No alimony or child
support, nothing.

1758
01:20:53,987 --> 01:20:56,857
Because, see, I have to, like,
look out for myself

1759
01:20:57,291 --> 01:20:59,326
and do what I want for once.

1760
01:21:09,570 --> 01:21:11,738
[cell phone vibrates]

1761
01:21:14,575 --> 01:21:17,945
Hello?
Oh, hey baby.

1762
01:21:18,912 --> 01:21:20,380
Uh, yeah, no, no.
We're all good.

1763
01:21:24,184 --> 01:21:25,252
I just had him on my show,

1764
01:21:25,352 --> 01:21:27,120
and he was flirting
with me on camera.

1765
01:21:27,221 --> 01:21:28,488
Doesn't Coco ever watch TV?

1766
01:21:29,189 --> 01:21:32,059
And then he was flirting
at Vic at Calloway's.

1767
01:21:32,125 --> 01:21:33,260
Wow. You know what?

1768
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:34,394
I'm not gonna say anything,

1769
01:21:34,494 --> 01:21:36,430
-but I told you so.
-Come on.

1770
01:21:36,530 --> 01:21:37,965
-You know, I really don't need
to hear that right now.

1771
01:21:38,065 --> 01:21:40,200
You don't? Sorry.

1772
01:21:41,068 --> 01:21:42,102
You know what?
I can take the kids

1773
01:21:42,202 --> 01:21:43,670
every day until 2:00.

1774
01:21:43,971 --> 01:21:45,138
Okay, well, if you do that,

1775
01:21:45,239 --> 01:21:47,207
then I'll take them from 2:00
until you get off work.

1776
01:21:47,374 --> 01:21:49,409
-I don't mind doing that.
-You guys would do that for me?

1777
01:21:49,710 --> 01:21:50,978
-Of course.
-Yeah.

1778
01:21:51,245 --> 01:21:52,412
It's easy for me to do anyway

1779
01:21:52,513 --> 01:21:53,914
because I work
during the day, so...

1780
01:21:53,981 --> 01:21:55,616
Doing what at the sperm bank?

1781
01:21:55,716 --> 01:21:57,117
Look, it's not a sperm bank.
Okay?

1782
01:21:57,217 --> 01:21:59,720
It's a reproductive science
center, not a sperm bank.

1783
01:21:59,786 --> 01:22:01,588
-It's my job.
-Sperm comes out.

1784
01:22:01,922 --> 01:22:02,990
-You put it in the bank.
-It's my--

1785
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:04,091
I'm not gonna talk
to you about this.

1786
01:22:04,625 --> 01:22:05,626
Listen, guys, I appreciate this.

1787
01:22:05,726 --> 01:22:07,094
-Oh, it's not a problem.
-This is only temporary.

1788
01:22:07,227 --> 01:22:08,529
until I find somebody.
All right?

1789
01:22:08,595 --> 01:22:10,230
-Oh, yeah. Cool.
-Take as long as you need.

1790
01:22:10,297 --> 01:22:11,732
It's no problem. He knows
it's no problem.

1791
01:22:12,966 --> 01:22:13,967
Oh, my God.

1792
01:22:17,171 --> 01:22:18,172
Oh, my God.

1793
01:22:19,339 --> 01:22:20,707
-That's your girl.
-That's,

1794
01:22:20,774 --> 01:22:22,543
that's Falinda. Falinda!

1795
01:22:24,111 --> 01:22:25,112
Falinda!

1796
01:22:25,412 --> 01:22:26,413
Falinda!

1797
01:22:27,915 --> 01:22:28,916
Hey.

1798
01:22:30,083 --> 01:22:32,319
Oh. How do I look real quick?
Just look at me.

1799
01:22:32,419 --> 01:22:34,154
Like a reproductive
science center.

1800
01:22:34,254 --> 01:22:36,723
Okay. Falinda, hey!

1801
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:38,358
-Hey!
-Oh, my goodness.

1802
01:22:40,494 --> 01:22:42,296
-Hi.
-What? Look at you!

1803
01:22:42,362 --> 01:22:43,430
-Hi.
-Hey.

1804
01:22:43,497 --> 01:22:44,932
-Hey.
-Hey. How you doing?

1805
01:22:44,998 --> 01:22:46,333
-Good. How are you?
-Good.

1806
01:22:46,433 --> 01:22:47,801
-All right.
-Okay.

1807
01:22:48,168 --> 01:22:50,604
All right
We talked enough to them.

1808
01:22:52,840 --> 01:22:53,841
What are you doing here?

1809
01:22:54,208 --> 01:22:56,577
I, um, was actually
looking for a job.

1810
01:22:57,477 --> 01:22:59,813
-Oh, okay, a job.
-Yeah.

1811
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:01,648
How's your, uh,
how's your boyfriend?

1812
01:23:02,683 --> 01:23:03,951
You mean my friend?

1813
01:23:04,017 --> 01:23:05,819
I thought he was your man.

1814
01:23:05,919 --> 01:23:07,454
No. He was just a friend.

1815
01:23:08,121 --> 01:23:10,691
Oh. Okay.

1816
01:23:12,626 --> 01:23:14,361
Hey, you wanna go out sometime?

1817
01:23:15,495 --> 01:23:16,496
I don't see why not.

1818
01:23:17,231 --> 01:23:18,398
Are you serious?

1819
01:23:18,866 --> 01:23:21,068
-Yeah, of course, I'm serious.
-You're not playing, right?

1820
01:23:21,168 --> 01:23:22,302
-No, I'm not playing.
-You're serious?

1821
01:23:22,369 --> 01:23:23,537
I'm being dead serious.

1822
01:23:23,637 --> 01:23:25,772
-Okay. All right
-Okay.

1823
01:23:26,874 --> 01:23:29,009
Um, so, uh, well,
what are you doing right now?

1824
01:23:29,176 --> 01:23:31,378
Right now, I'm not doing
nothing. I'm talking to you.

1825
01:23:31,478 --> 01:23:32,779
-Oh.
-Just, that's it.

1826
01:23:34,982 --> 01:23:36,049
Don't you have to go to work?

1827
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:38,852
Oh, that's right.
You have banker's hours.

1828
01:23:38,952 --> 01:23:42,089
-Yeah, I work during the day.
-[coughs]

1829
01:23:42,956 --> 01:23:44,057
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah.

1830
01:23:44,224 --> 01:23:46,560
It's not really banker's hours.
It's that same language,

1831
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:48,829
but just with different
words, kind of.

1832
01:23:49,663 --> 01:23:50,797
-Oh, okay.
-Yeah.

1833
01:23:51,098 --> 01:23:52,733
Well, if you're hungry
right now, I...

1834
01:23:53,066 --> 01:23:54,067
I mean,
I could definitely eat.

1835
01:23:54,168 --> 01:23:55,235
Yeah, no. I could eat .

1836
01:23:55,669 --> 01:23:58,338
Because I ate earlier,
but I didn't finish my food,

1837
01:23:58,405 --> 01:24:01,041
so I still got room left if you
want to eat some other stuff.

1838
01:24:01,108 --> 01:24:03,076
-Yeah.
-I'll eat some of your stuff.

1839
01:24:03,410 --> 01:24:04,811
-Okay.
-You want to eat here?

1840
01:24:05,412 --> 01:24:06,513
-Yeah.
-Okay, so I'll tell you what?

1841
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:08,382
Let's go over there.
Let's get something to eat.

1842
01:24:08,448 --> 01:24:10,284
-All right.
-The food is really good.

1843
01:24:10,384 --> 01:24:12,386
Oh, thanks.
Yay, I'm excited.

1844
01:24:12,452 --> 01:24:13,587
...that I was feeling

1845
01:24:13,687 --> 01:24:17,124
I've been observing you
from afar

1846
01:24:17,224 --> 01:24:19,459
And seeing your pretty face

1847
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:23,030
Lit up my day
like a morning star

1848
01:24:23,764 --> 01:24:28,035
And this ain't even the way
to work for me

1849
01:24:28,902 --> 01:24:32,039
But you're worth
the long wait

1850
01:24:32,105 --> 01:24:35,742
There's so much I want to say,
and it can't wait

1851
01:24:35,843 --> 01:24:37,377
So tell me your name

1852
01:24:37,444 --> 01:24:40,781
Do you know by now
I got a thing for you

1853
01:24:41,114 --> 01:24:44,184
If you dig it, girl,
I'll bet I adore you

1854
01:24:44,284 --> 01:24:47,855
I've been wondering
how I want to show you

1855
01:24:48,856 --> 01:24:51,758
I'll start with hello,
a simple hello

1856
01:24:51,859 --> 01:24:55,195
Do you know by now
I got a thing for you

1857
01:24:55,262 --> 01:24:56,263
If you didn't know now

1858
01:24:57,331 --> 01:24:58,398
-It's, um--
-Watch it.

1859
01:25:00,667 --> 01:25:01,668
Sorry. Sorry.

1860
01:25:01,768 --> 01:25:02,970
-She's good. She's good.
-I'm gonna leave.

1861
01:25:03,570 --> 01:25:05,873
-Chairs.
-I'm gonna leave. We're ready.

1862
01:25:05,973 --> 01:25:07,774
Bye. Food is really good.

1863
01:25:08,208 --> 01:25:10,744
-Good meeting you, Linda.
-It's Falinda.

1864
01:25:10,811 --> 01:25:13,313
-Falinda.
-Okay.

1865
01:25:13,413 --> 01:25:14,481
See you guys later.

1866
01:25:16,316 --> 01:25:18,285
So, uh, how's the job
search going?

1867
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:20,687
Actually not going so good.

1868
01:25:20,787 --> 01:25:23,524
I was, um, thinking about moving
to Atlanta because it

1869
01:25:23,624 --> 01:25:25,325
seems like there's
better opportunities there.

1870
01:25:25,826 --> 01:25:28,762
Oh, well, that's definitely not
a good idea.

1871
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:31,131
And why not?

1872
01:25:31,698 --> 01:25:33,367
Well, if you move,
then that'll ruin my chances

1873
01:25:33,467 --> 01:25:34,768
of getting to know you
a little better.

1874
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:41,909
You're really very cute,
you know that?

1875
01:25:43,443 --> 01:25:45,712
Don't do that,
just start doing that.

1876
01:25:45,812 --> 01:25:47,614
Don't give me no compliments
and make me blush.

1877
01:25:48,282 --> 01:25:50,250
I'm dark. I don't want you
to see that side of me.

1878
01:25:50,317 --> 01:25:52,085
Well, since you're being nice,
I got a confession to make.

1879
01:25:52,152 --> 01:25:53,921
I'm just gonna
throw it out there.

1880
01:25:54,321 --> 01:25:55,389
Okay. I'm just gonna say it.

1881
01:25:55,489 --> 01:25:56,490
-Okay?
-Okay.

1882
01:25:56,557 --> 01:25:57,558
All right. Here it comes.

1883
01:25:58,125 --> 01:25:59,126
Haven't stopped thinking
about you since

1884
01:25:59,193 --> 01:26:01,094
the first time I saw you. Boom.

1885
01:26:01,161 --> 01:26:02,462
-[smacks lips]
-[chuckles]

1886
01:26:05,799 --> 01:26:07,801
-Since we're making confessions,
-Okay.

1887
01:26:07,868 --> 01:26:09,736
there's actually something
that I want to tell you, too.

1888
01:26:10,204 --> 01:26:11,271
All right. Go ahead.

1889
01:26:11,338 --> 01:26:12,506
I'm a little nervous
because I don't,

1890
01:26:12,573 --> 01:26:16,577
I don't know how you're
gonna take this, but [sighs]

1891
01:26:19,346 --> 01:26:20,380
[in deep voice]
I used to be a man.

1892
01:26:25,652 --> 01:26:27,154
[normal voice] I'm just kidding.

1893
01:26:29,990 --> 01:26:31,491
-I'm just kidding.
-Right.

1894
01:26:31,558 --> 01:26:33,560
-Don't look at me like that.
-Right, no. You're playing.

1895
01:26:33,660 --> 01:26:34,661
-I'm playing.
-Right?

1896
01:26:35,762 --> 01:26:36,763
I'm kidding.

1897
01:26:38,232 --> 01:26:40,300
I don't know, no.
You're funny. That was funny.

1898
01:26:40,367 --> 01:26:41,368
That was funny.

1899
01:26:41,869 --> 01:26:43,403
Uh, anyway, what are you
doing Friday?

1900
01:26:44,004 --> 01:26:46,507
I have to go to my
girlfriend's bachelorette party.

1901
01:26:46,907 --> 01:26:48,308
-Oh, man. Okay.
-Yeah.

1902
01:26:50,744 --> 01:26:53,747
But, um, I'd be willing
to cancel that for you.

1903
01:26:55,382 --> 01:26:56,383
You would do that for me?

1904
01:26:57,184 --> 01:26:58,185
Absolutely.

1905
01:26:59,353 --> 01:27:03,156
Oh, I got to take
a sip of water to that. Mmm.

1906
01:27:03,557 --> 01:27:04,925
You drink a lot of water.

1907
01:27:05,726 --> 01:27:08,862
It's just my system.
I keep it clean for my job.

1908
01:27:10,764 --> 01:27:12,332
-Got you.
-Yeah.

1909
01:27:13,233 --> 01:27:16,103
All right. So I essentially
located everything here.

1910
01:27:16,203 --> 01:27:18,038
All right?
So, uh, okay,

1911
01:27:18,105 --> 01:27:19,806
baby wipes.
Let me get those for you.

1912
01:27:20,774 --> 01:27:21,775
Boom, baby wipes.

1913
01:27:21,875 --> 01:27:23,944
Um, if you need more baby wipes,

1914
01:27:24,111 --> 01:27:25,779
they're actually
in the bathroom, okay?

1915
01:27:25,879 --> 01:27:27,047
-Okay.
-Uh, what else am I forgetting?

1916
01:27:27,114 --> 01:27:28,182
Let me so.
Oh, here.

1917
01:27:28,715 --> 01:27:33,120
This here is for nose and
this here is Vaseline.

1918
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:34,755
-It keeps her moisturized, okay?
-Vaseline, got it.

1919
01:27:35,656 --> 01:27:38,225
Mom's work number on the fridge
ready for you to call her, okay?

1920
01:27:38,292 --> 01:27:40,260
-Phil, get out of here.
-Yeah.

1921
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:42,396
-Relax. I got this.
-Oh, okay. I appreciate it.

1922
01:27:42,462 --> 01:27:43,597
-All right, um.
-Okay.

1923
01:27:43,664 --> 01:27:44,932
Yeah, call me
if you need anything. All right?

1924
01:27:44,998 --> 01:27:46,266
-It's good.
-All right.

1925
01:27:47,201 --> 01:27:50,103
Oh, um, PJ loves those
buttery crackers.

1926
01:27:50,204 --> 01:27:51,205
-They're in the crib.
-Go.

1927
01:27:51,538 --> 01:27:52,539
Okay.

1928
01:27:52,806 --> 01:27:54,107
-Bye.
-All right.

1929
01:27:56,844 --> 01:27:57,911
That's okay.

1930
01:27:57,978 --> 01:27:59,413
-Oh.
-No!

1931
01:28:00,113 --> 01:28:01,148
All right.

1932
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:05,752
[peaceful music]

1933
01:28:25,339 --> 01:28:27,441
[music continues]

1934
01:28:46,793 --> 01:28:49,530
-Hey. Sorry I'm late.
-Aah. Oh, God.

1935
01:28:50,163 --> 01:28:51,198
Oh, no. It's okay.

1936
01:28:51,298 --> 01:28:52,466
-Hey.
-It's okay. Um,

1937
01:28:53,367 --> 01:28:55,602
what time is it? Okay.
How'd it go with Falinda?

1938
01:28:56,637 --> 01:28:57,638
I got her number.

1939
01:28:57,704 --> 01:28:58,972
We supposed to go out
on Saturday.

1940
01:28:59,039 --> 01:29:01,074
-What?
-Huh? Huh? Give me some.

1941
01:29:01,175 --> 01:29:02,843
-You the man. You the man.
-No, Zen.

1942
01:29:02,910 --> 01:29:04,912
-You the man. You are the--
-Zen. No, Zen. Zen!

1943
01:29:05,012 --> 01:29:06,346
-Oh, sorry. Oh, damn.
-[baby crying]

1944
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:08,615
Okay. Um, she probably
needs to be changed,

1945
01:29:08,682 --> 01:29:09,683
but my shift is over. Okay?

1946
01:29:09,917 --> 01:29:12,619
-Congratulations.
-Okay. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

1947
01:29:12,686 --> 01:29:13,687
What do I do? What do I do?

1948
01:29:13,754 --> 01:29:14,821
The instructions
are over there.

1949
01:29:15,756 --> 01:29:16,890
Oh, you know what?

1950
01:29:16,990 --> 01:29:20,894
He's probably gonna call you
in five, four, three, two.

1951
01:29:21,461 --> 01:29:22,996
[cell phone rings]

1952
01:29:24,831 --> 01:29:25,899
How'd you know that?

1953
01:29:26,466 --> 01:29:27,835
He's called me every 10 minutes.

1954
01:29:28,535 --> 01:29:29,536
Bye.

1955
01:29:29,870 --> 01:29:31,705
Uh, yeah. I just got here.

1956
01:29:31,939 --> 01:29:34,241
Girl, will you come on?
[laughter]

1957
01:29:36,376 --> 01:29:37,578
Do they want tickets?

1958
01:29:38,512 --> 01:29:40,681
You know, we can let the kids
sit in the box. [Laughter]

1959
01:29:50,557 --> 01:29:52,092
Where you going, Mommy?

1960
01:29:52,759 --> 01:29:54,561
Mommy will be back
in a few days, okay?

1961
01:29:54,862 --> 01:29:55,863
Okay.

1962
01:29:57,064 --> 01:29:58,065
[silent]

1963
01:29:58,131 --> 01:30:00,567
Come on, PJ. Let's go.
Come on, buddy.

1964
01:30:00,934 --> 01:30:01,935
Come on, baby.

1965
01:30:02,703 --> 01:30:04,204
You want Nick West's hamstrings
to get tight?

1966
01:30:04,271 --> 01:30:05,706
It's colder than a witch's titty
out here.

1967
01:30:06,573 --> 01:30:08,041
We got a championship to win.

1968
01:30:08,242 --> 01:30:10,110
Can you say playoff?
[laughter]

1969
01:30:12,045 --> 01:30:14,548
Whoa! What is that?
It's a jump shot.

1970
01:30:16,216 --> 01:30:20,287
Oh, hop in, girl. Mm.
Nick West like that dress.

1971
01:30:21,922 --> 01:30:23,924
[sentimental music]

1972
01:30:29,596 --> 01:30:31,231
[engine starts]

1973
01:30:39,106 --> 01:30:41,108
So, you ever been
to Vintage before?

1974
01:30:41,475 --> 01:30:42,876
Nope. This is my first time.

1975
01:30:43,177 --> 01:30:44,578
-This is your first time?
-Mm-hmm.

1976
01:30:44,711 --> 01:30:46,146
Well, we got to make
your first time a good time.

1977
01:30:46,580 --> 01:30:49,082
-This is a good time [chuckles]
-Wait a minute.

1978
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:51,919
I'm being rude.
How's the job search going?

1979
01:30:52,819 --> 01:30:56,190
It's going good.
I have an interview on Monday

1980
01:30:57,024 --> 01:30:58,125
in Atlanta.

1981
01:30:59,993 --> 01:31:01,995
-In Atlanta.
-Yeah.

1982
01:31:03,130 --> 01:31:07,034
-I don't want you to get it.
-That's not very nice.

1983
01:31:07,501 --> 01:31:08,769
Well, I don't want you
to leave me.

1984
01:31:09,603 --> 01:31:10,604
That's the problem.

1985
01:31:10,671 --> 01:31:12,306
I mean, honestly, I feel like
I could take care of you.

1986
01:31:13,173 --> 01:31:15,142
-I could.
-Don't be silly.

1987
01:31:15,509 --> 01:31:17,611
No, silly would be me
letting you out of my life.

1988
01:31:18,212 --> 01:31:19,213
That would be silly.

1989
01:31:19,913 --> 01:31:21,849
Just promise me one thing.
At least keep looking here.

1990
01:31:22,149 --> 01:31:23,183
Do that for me.

1991
01:31:25,319 --> 01:31:26,320
I'll think about it.

1992
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:29,656
-Think about it.
-Think about it.

1993
01:31:31,158 --> 01:31:32,492
[laughter]

1994
01:31:35,362 --> 01:31:36,530
Excuse me for a second.

1995
01:31:37,798 --> 01:31:38,799
Where are you going?

1996
01:31:39,299 --> 01:31:41,068
I got something I need to say
to somebody.

1997
01:31:54,615 --> 01:31:55,649
Sit down, bitch.

1998
01:31:56,216 --> 01:31:57,818
-It's cool.
-Excuse me.

1999
01:31:59,186 --> 01:32:02,256
Boy, Coco, you are a foul,
despicable person.

2000
01:32:02,356 --> 01:32:03,357
You know that?

2001
01:32:03,423 --> 01:32:04,558
What's your problem,
little man?

2002
01:32:04,658 --> 01:32:06,660
-Shut up, bitch.
-[giggles ]That's good.

2003
01:32:08,061 --> 01:32:10,430
I know good and well you ain't
talking to Nick West,

2004
01:32:10,531 --> 01:32:12,666
A.K.A. Nick the Quick,
like that.

2005
01:32:12,733 --> 01:32:15,969
You can either A.K.A. sit your
ass down or get laid down.

2006
01:32:16,103 --> 01:32:17,538
-Pick one.
-Is that right?

2007
01:32:18,639 --> 01:32:21,508
Position his head, please.
Little more to the left.

2008
01:32:21,575 --> 01:32:22,876
-Get off my head, man.
-Right there.

2009
01:32:24,912 --> 01:32:27,848
[Coco cackles]
Oh, my hat. My hat, please.

2010
01:32:29,516 --> 01:32:30,684
[voice echoes] Cleavon.

2011
01:32:32,286 --> 01:32:36,123
Cleavon, hey. Hey!

2012
01:32:36,690 --> 01:32:37,691
What are you doing?

2013
01:32:39,693 --> 01:32:42,362
Oh, nothing.

2014
01:32:43,197 --> 01:32:46,834
Nothing. Just looking
at my friend's future ex-wife.

2015
01:32:48,268 --> 01:32:49,269
Oh.

2016
01:32:50,938 --> 01:32:53,006
Well, I'd prefer
you be looking at me.

2017
01:32:56,577 --> 01:33:01,014
I would prefer that, too.
I'm sorry. Thank you.

2018
01:33:01,481 --> 01:33:02,783
Thank you for a great evening.

2019
01:33:02,883 --> 01:33:04,484
I can tell, girl

2020
01:33:08,455 --> 01:33:12,426
That you've had
Some hard times in your life

2021
01:33:17,431 --> 01:33:18,899
Baby, just take my hand

2022
01:33:18,966 --> 01:33:21,935
And let me show you
A better way

2023
01:33:25,572 --> 01:33:28,976
Let me shower you
With the finer things

2024
01:33:31,778 --> 01:33:32,779
Oh

2025
01:33:36,950 --> 01:33:38,485
I lift mine eyes

2026
01:33:40,654 --> 01:33:42,623
Up to the hills

2027
01:33:43,524 --> 01:33:47,494
From which cometh my help

2028
01:33:52,766 --> 01:33:55,335
I'll lift mine eyes

2029
01:33:57,237 --> 01:33:58,672
To the hills

2030
01:33:59,540 --> 01:34:03,177
From which cometh my help

2031
01:34:03,677 --> 01:34:05,445
His will be done

2032
01:34:22,496 --> 01:34:24,298
-Well, hey, Cleve, courtesy kit?
-Hey.

2033
01:34:25,732 --> 01:34:27,267
It's not that crowded
in here today, huh?

2034
01:34:27,334 --> 01:34:29,203
Well, no.
They finally got me some help.

2035
01:34:30,404 --> 01:34:31,705
I'm happy for you.

2036
01:34:31,805 --> 01:34:33,173
And what will it be
for you today?

2037
01:34:33,674 --> 01:34:37,044
We got "Mr. Milf", "Sassy,
Showered and Shaven".

2038
01:34:38,145 --> 01:34:39,213
Those are pretty popular.

2039
01:34:39,313 --> 01:34:42,282
[whistles]
I'm gonna go with the "Shaven".

2040
01:34:42,716 --> 01:34:43,717
I don't know
what happened to you.

2041
01:34:43,817 --> 01:34:45,819
I haven't seen you on Monday,
on Tuesday.

2042
01:34:45,886 --> 01:34:48,355
We almost went bankrupt
without you being in here.

2043
01:34:48,422 --> 01:34:49,423
Nice.

2044
01:34:49,823 --> 01:34:51,291
Oh, hey, Cleavon.

2045
01:34:51,358 --> 01:34:52,960
-Real nice.
-This is the new girl.

2046
01:34:53,026 --> 01:34:55,128
This is Falinda.
Falinda, that's Cleavon.

2047
01:34:55,295 --> 01:34:56,997
He's one of our
very best customers.

2048
01:34:57,764 --> 01:34:59,032
Get to know him, girl,
because he's here

2049
01:34:59,132 --> 01:35:01,034
-almost every other day.
-No, no, no.

2050
01:35:02,035 --> 01:35:03,303
No, no, no.

2051
01:35:03,737 --> 01:35:05,906
Cleavon usually likes
the courtesy pack.

2052
01:35:06,673 --> 01:35:08,408
You gonna need
the goggles today, Cleve?

2053
01:35:08,509 --> 01:35:10,777
-Uh...
-I know you like your lotion.

2054
01:35:10,878 --> 01:35:12,379
He's a lotion man.

2055
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:15,015
Here you go. All right.
Guess what?

2056
01:35:15,082 --> 01:35:17,184
Room three is open right now.
You can go ahead on in.

2057
01:35:17,251 --> 01:35:18,785
I think that's all ready
for you.

2058
01:35:18,886 --> 01:35:20,020
Okay, room three.

2059
01:35:22,256 --> 01:35:23,624
He won't be in there
long because

2060
01:35:24,191 --> 01:35:26,159
it don't take him but a minute.

2061
01:35:27,528 --> 01:35:28,929
You forgot your wet wipes!

2062
01:35:32,799 --> 01:35:36,403
So stupid. So stupid, man.

2063
01:35:36,703 --> 01:35:41,241
Oh, God.
[sighs, blows lips]

2064
01:35:43,877 --> 01:35:45,078
Just dumb.

2065
01:35:47,648 --> 01:35:49,049
[door creaks open] Cleavon?

2066
01:35:55,589 --> 01:35:58,725
Look, uh, I feel like
such a idiot, man.

2067
01:35:59,793 --> 01:36:01,995
I can only imagine what
you're thinking right now.

2068
01:36:03,397 --> 01:36:06,300
I'm embarrassed.
I mean, I'm really embarrassed.

2069
01:36:06,733 --> 01:36:08,669
So this is the bank
that you work at?

2070
01:36:10,604 --> 01:36:13,607
Yeah.
This is the bank that I work at.

2071
01:36:15,309 --> 01:36:16,777
Look, I'm sorry.
I mean, I've been

2072
01:36:16,844 --> 01:36:20,614
really dishonest with you,
and I'm sorry.

2073
01:36:24,084 --> 01:36:25,419
Just say you'll quit.

2074
01:36:27,387 --> 01:36:28,388
What?

2075
01:36:29,690 --> 01:36:34,461
Just say
that you will quit this job.

2076
01:36:43,437 --> 01:36:47,341
Mm. I quit.

2077
01:36:48,108 --> 01:36:49,576
Yeah, no, no. I quit.

2078
01:36:49,643 --> 01:36:52,880
-It never was, like, a job.
-[giggles]

2079
01:36:53,447 --> 01:36:57,017
-It wasn't my job.
-Mm-hmm. I know.

2080
01:36:57,518 --> 01:37:01,455
There's always time

2081
01:37:03,490 --> 01:37:07,594
To look within yourself

2082
01:37:09,329 --> 01:37:14,434
To find a way

2083
01:37:14,501 --> 01:37:19,173
Out of darkness

2084
01:37:22,309 --> 01:37:27,748
The light, the power

2085
01:37:28,448 --> 01:37:32,886
I can feel it
In your embrace

2086
01:37:34,388 --> 01:37:36,823
And I believe

2087
01:37:37,891 --> 01:37:42,996
I'll always have faith

2088
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:49,303
In your arms

2089
01:37:49,369 --> 01:37:51,405
I came far

2090
01:37:52,706 --> 01:37:54,741
I can feel

2091
01:37:56,210 --> 01:37:57,911
I'm home

2092
01:37:58,846 --> 01:38:01,515
In your arms

2093
01:38:02,883 --> 01:38:06,720
I'll never get lost

2094
01:38:08,322 --> 01:38:11,391
I'll never get lost
When I'm with you

2095
01:38:11,491 --> 01:38:16,697
There's always protection

2096
01:38:18,866 --> 01:38:22,803
In your guidings

2097
01:38:24,338 --> 01:38:27,374
And I'm humble

2098
01:38:28,141 --> 01:38:32,279
In your grace

2099
01:38:36,350 --> 01:38:41,588
Take me higher, inspire

2100
01:38:43,390 --> 01:38:47,794
And fill me with your love

2101
01:38:48,862 --> 01:38:51,732
I can trust

2102
01:38:52,866 --> 01:38:57,104
My own intuition

2103
01:39:01,308 --> 01:39:03,410
In your arms

2104
01:39:04,411 --> 01:39:06,747
I came far

2105
01:39:07,548 --> 01:39:09,583
I can feel

2106
01:39:10,984 --> 01:39:12,819
I'm home

2107
01:39:13,654 --> 01:39:17,191
In your arms

2108
01:39:17,724 --> 01:39:21,328
I'll never get lost

2109
01:39:23,463 --> 01:39:26,266
I'll never get lost
When I'm with you

2110
01:39:26,333 --> 01:39:28,902
I am blind

2111
01:39:29,336 --> 01:39:32,339
I can't see

2112
01:39:32,439 --> 01:39:37,678
Without you here with me

2113
01:39:38,612 --> 01:39:41,782
I can fly

2114
01:39:41,849 --> 01:39:44,818
I can fall

2115
01:39:44,918 --> 01:39:50,290
When I'm with you,
I'll spread my wings

2116
01:39:50,691 --> 01:39:52,059
Oh

2117
01:39:53,594 --> 01:39:55,929
In your arms

2118
01:39:57,397 --> 01:40:00,400
In your arms

2119
01:40:00,601 --> 01:40:02,536
I came far

2120
01:40:03,837 --> 01:40:05,973
I can feel

2121
01:40:06,807 --> 01:40:09,409
Baby, baby, I'm...

2122
01:40:10,477 --> 01:40:12,646
-I'm ready to come home.
-Okay, Coco.

2123
01:40:13,347 --> 01:40:14,715
Leave, you're upsetting
the kids. All right?

2124
01:40:14,815 --> 01:40:16,617
Did you hear what I said?
I said I'm ready to come home.

2125
01:40:16,683 --> 01:40:18,519
Coco, our divorce has been
final for over three months.

2126
01:40:18,619 --> 01:40:19,820
All right?
-I know.

2127
01:40:19,887 --> 01:40:22,089
-I know, but I made a mistake.
-Okay. We all make mistakes,

2128
01:40:22,689 --> 01:40:23,957
and we all need to be
held accountable for them.

2129
01:40:24,024 --> 01:40:25,559
Now, would you please leave,
Coco?

2130
01:40:26,426 --> 01:40:27,961
Why are you talking me
like this?

2131
01:40:28,695 --> 01:40:29,830
Coco, leave.

2132
01:40:30,497 --> 01:40:33,367
-I need you to leave.
-Mm, okay.

2133
01:40:33,734 --> 01:40:35,669
So, baby, just, um,
give me your key.

2134
01:40:35,736 --> 01:40:36,970
-Coco, I need you to leave.
-Because I got my stuff in--

2135
01:40:37,037 --> 01:40:38,372
-Okay, now.
-Just...

2136
01:40:38,438 --> 01:40:40,807
Just give me your keys,Phil.
Please, just--

2137
01:40:40,874 --> 01:40:41,975
You know what, Coco?
You're not gonna talk

2138
01:40:42,042 --> 01:40:43,277
to my fiancé like this.

2139
01:40:46,246 --> 01:40:48,115
-Your fiancé?
-Yes, my fiancé.

2140
01:40:50,350 --> 01:40:52,352
-You got this thing pregnant?
-You know what?

2141
01:40:52,419 --> 01:40:54,121
This thing is having his child,

2142
01:40:54,221 --> 01:40:56,657
and this thing is taking care
of the kids you've abandoned,

2143
01:40:57,424 --> 01:40:59,259
and trust me,
if you say one more thing,

2144
01:40:59,359 --> 01:41:00,661
this thing doesn't have
a problem

2145
01:41:00,727 --> 01:41:02,729
giving you a beatdown
in front of church.

2146
01:41:06,099 --> 01:41:07,367
Leave my mommy alone.

2147
01:41:09,570 --> 01:41:13,774
See?
My boy has his mama back.

2148
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:21,882
You turned my kids
against me?

2149
01:41:22,482 --> 01:41:24,484
You turned my kids
against me?

2150
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:29,122
Oh, what? Get off of me!

2151
01:41:29,223 --> 01:41:30,490
Get off of me.

2152
01:41:33,026 --> 01:41:35,929
-Coco, leave.
-You turned my kids against me?

2153
01:41:46,039 --> 01:41:47,074
What you looking at?

2154
01:41:57,117 --> 01:42:00,120
Mm. I think she was drunk.

2155
01:42:01,054 --> 01:42:02,256
[engine starts]

2156
01:42:08,161 --> 01:42:10,797
She is my baby

2157
01:42:11,265 --> 01:42:14,468
Congratulations!
[all cheering]

2158
01:42:17,938 --> 01:42:19,439
Cleavon!

2159
01:42:21,441 --> 01:42:24,711
She is my baby

2160
01:42:26,513 --> 01:42:29,716
-Look at that.
-Oh, she is so cute.

2161
01:42:30,651 --> 01:42:31,952
When do you get
to bring her home?

2162
01:42:32,019 --> 01:42:34,555
The adoption agency said
in about four more weeks.

2163
01:42:34,655 --> 01:42:36,690
Give me that, snuggle bum!

2164
01:42:37,191 --> 01:42:39,560
-She's so adorable.
-Thank you.

2165
01:42:39,660 --> 01:42:40,928
Look at her.

2166
01:42:40,994 --> 01:42:43,096
You know being this
many months pregnant,

2167
01:42:43,163 --> 01:42:44,932
you are not supposed
to be in this Jacuzzi.

2168
01:42:44,998 --> 01:42:46,366
Oh, girl, please,
I would do anything

2169
01:42:46,466 --> 01:42:47,668
to get my water to break.

2170
01:42:48,001 --> 01:42:49,803
Baby, how you gonna know
if your water breaks

2171
01:42:49,870 --> 01:42:50,871
if you're in here?

2172
01:42:51,505 --> 01:42:53,473
Oh, trust me. I will know.

2173
01:42:54,508 --> 01:42:55,809
When does Cleavon get off?

2174
01:42:56,043 --> 01:42:57,044
Ooh, honey.

2175
01:42:57,144 --> 01:42:59,346
I remember there was a time
we couldn't ask that question

2176
01:42:59,413 --> 01:43:01,515
quite like that before you.
[giggles]

2177
01:43:02,316 --> 01:43:04,518
Y'all don't stop laughing
at my husband.

2178
01:43:04,585 --> 01:43:05,819
-He should be off about now.

2179
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:08,555
And you know what?
We really appreciate

2180
01:43:08,655 --> 01:43:09,656
that you gave him that job.

2181
01:43:09,723 --> 01:43:10,824
Ah, it's all good.

2182
01:43:10,891 --> 01:43:13,227
Figured he drank so much water,
he might as well deliver it.

2183
01:43:15,295 --> 01:43:16,730
-Speak of the devil.
-Hey, everybody.

2184
01:43:16,830 --> 01:43:18,398
-[all] Hey!
-I knew y'all was down here.

2185
01:43:18,498 --> 01:43:19,499
I knew you was.

2186
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:21,535
Hey, baby. Watch out.

2187
01:43:21,602 --> 01:43:24,838
Let me get in here, been waiting
to get in this thing all day.

2188
01:43:26,306 --> 01:43:27,541
-Ooh!
-Oh, there it is.

2189
01:43:27,908 --> 01:43:29,510
-Word up.
-That's the good stuff.

2190
01:43:35,749 --> 01:43:36,984
Why is everybody getting out?

2191
01:43:37,784 --> 01:43:41,154
Ah, they probably all got to go
do something

2192
01:43:41,221 --> 01:43:42,623
at the same time.

2193
01:43:43,724 --> 01:43:45,192
It's just us in here now,
though.

2194
01:43:45,392 --> 01:43:46,860
-The way it's supposed to be.
-Yeah.

2195
01:43:48,695 --> 01:43:51,198
-Oh, my leg is itching.
-Yeah.

2196
01:43:54,601 --> 01:43:57,471
Sorry. Oh, man.

2197
01:43:58,172 --> 01:43:59,173
It got warmer, though,
didn't it?

2198
01:43:59,239 --> 01:44:00,741
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

2199
01:44:02,176 --> 01:44:03,177
[yawns]

2200
01:44:05,279 --> 01:44:06,413
Oh, God.

2201
01:44:12,586 --> 01:44:13,620
Honey?

2202
01:44:16,123 --> 01:44:18,125
[gentle electronic music]

2203
01:44:54,628 --> 01:44:56,630
[music continues]

2204
01:46:32,192 --> 01:46:33,794
Oh

2205
01:46:38,398 --> 01:46:39,433
Oh

2206
01:46:41,502 --> 01:46:44,671
So wonderful, so wonderful

2207
01:46:51,578 --> 01:46:54,114
I don't even have to tell you
That I love you

2208
01:46:54,214 --> 01:46:57,117
It's automatic
I'm infatuated with you

2209
01:46:57,618 --> 01:47:00,153
We continue to knock
The real queue

2210
01:47:00,287 --> 01:47:03,056
Of outsiders
Doubting our union

2211
01:47:03,557 --> 01:47:06,293
I fell in love the first
Minute that I met you

2212
01:47:06,393 --> 01:47:09,329
I didn't think that both of us
Together would prove

2213
01:47:09,730 --> 01:47:12,299
To be so magical,
Beautiful, you

2214
01:47:12,399 --> 01:47:15,736
You make every day
Seem so wonderful

2215
01:47:15,802 --> 01:47:17,871
So wonderful

2216
01:47:17,938 --> 01:47:21,074
Anyone with eyes
Can see with you

2217
01:47:21,141 --> 01:47:23,644
Is where I do belong

2218
01:47:23,777 --> 01:47:27,481
Want to spend all my time
With you

2219
01:47:27,881 --> 01:47:29,816
So wonderful

2220
01:47:29,917 --> 01:47:33,120
Anyone with eyes
Can see with you

2221
01:47:33,187 --> 01:47:35,789
Is where I do belong

2222
01:47:35,923 --> 01:47:39,726
Want to spend all my time
With you

2223
01:47:40,194 --> 01:47:42,729
I can't even see myself
Out here without you

2224
01:47:42,796 --> 01:47:45,632
And in the moments when I wake
Up feeling brand-new

2225
01:47:45,999 --> 01:47:48,802
You're my protector,
Director in my movie

2226
01:47:48,936 --> 01:47:51,839
You are the strength
When I need someone to talk to

2227
01:47:51,939 --> 01:47:54,842
We work together like
The weather, Sun and the Moon

2228
01:47:54,942 --> 01:47:58,011
I'll always be your bride,
You will always be my boo

2229
01:47:58,111 --> 01:48:00,914
I feel glad to have been
Able to cruise

2230
01:48:00,981 --> 01:48:04,585
Love's potions,
That's so wonderful

2231
01:48:04,651 --> 01:48:06,486
So wonderful

2232
01:48:06,587 --> 01:48:09,690
Anyone with eyes
Can see with you

2233
01:48:09,790 --> 01:48:12,226
Is where I do belong

2234
01:48:12,492 --> 01:48:16,163
Want to spend all my time
With you

2235
01:48:16,230 --> 01:48:18,465
So wonderful

2236
01:48:18,532 --> 01:48:21,869
Anyone with eyes
Can see with you

2237
01:48:21,969 --> 01:48:24,471
Is where I do belong

2238
01:48:24,538 --> 01:48:29,243
Want to spend all my time
With you

2239
01:48:29,343 --> 01:48:30,978
So beautiful

2240
01:48:31,044 --> 01:48:33,847
Your loving keeps me
On my toes

2241
01:48:33,947 --> 01:48:35,415
On my toes
