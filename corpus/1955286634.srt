Uh... sort of.

613

I mean, when I see someone new,

614

them 'til they smile

615
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:52,396

royal couple!

733
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:45,255
Yeah!

734
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:46,557
Whoo!

735
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:48,659
Now, don't you two
look surprised.

736
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,829
I thought it was gonna be Rufus.

737
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,497
It was Rufus' idea.

738
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,565
(all)
Yeah.

739
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:55,532
You know who to vote for.

740
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,167
The big dog, am I right?

741
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,635
The big dog!

742
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:00,637
And you guys know
who the big dog is?

743
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:02,005
That's right, my boy Manny.

744
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:06,643
All right.

745
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:08,245
But what about me?

746
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:10,080
That was his idea too.

747
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:12,850
And vote for Paige too 'cause
Manny really likes her.

748
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,353
So how does it feel to be king?!

749
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:20,224
Right now, I don't feel
like a king.

750
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:24,841
I feel like
a low-down dirty dog.

751
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,003
Thank you, everyone...

752
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,507
for this very kind
and thoughtful honor.

753
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:42,112
But... after the way
I treated my friend,

754
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,481
my best friend,

755
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,250
there's...

756
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:48,585
no way I can accept this.

757
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:49,987
What?

758
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:51,855
What?
What?

759
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:53,323
I also cannot accept.

760
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,260
If you read
my three-part series,

761
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:58,796
"The Shameful Sham Of Class
102's Homeroom President,"

762
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:01,331
then you know I find
these popularity contests

763
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:03,066
objectifying and demeaning.

764
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:07,778
On the other hand...

765
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:11,909
tiaras are kind of cute.

766
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,544
(scattered applause)

767
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:17,881
Rufus?

768
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:19,449
Hey, Rufus.

769
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:20,717
Manny.

770
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:22,085
What's going on?

771
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,188
Paige, I can't
explain it to you.

772
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:26,536
You'd never believe...
me.
Rufus is a dog.

773
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,259
How could you
possibly know that?

774
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,061
A reporter's instinct.

775
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:34,411
And he told me.

776
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,669
Oh, and also...
I'g.a do

777
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:44,942
That would be D-O...
A dog?

778
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,743
(Paige)
Told me about
the magic necklace,

779
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:48,512
your wish and everything.

780
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,947
Of course he did.

781
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:53,183
Look, I owe Rufus
a huge apology.

782
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:55,252
Can you help me find him?

783
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,486
You go that way,
I'll go this way.

784
00:30:56,554 --> 00:30:58,155
We meet on the other
side of the library.

785
00:30:58,223 --> 00:30:59,423
Thanks, Paige.

786
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,026
Rufus, where are you, boy?

787
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:05,362
(howling in the distance)

788
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:08,432
Rufus?

789
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:10,834
(Dad)
Hey, Linda,
did you walk the dog?

790
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:12,970
Nope, did you?

791
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,037
No.

792
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:15,385
I haven't seen him either.

793
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:19,343
Maybe he's eating
your wedding dress.

794
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,245
It'll match your shoes.

795
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:22,779
That's not funny.

796
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:24,047
Rufus?

797
00:31:24,115 --> 00:31:26,355
Rufus?
Rufus?

798
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:29,019
Rufus... Rufus?

799
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:30,454
(whistling)

800
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:31,955
Rufus?

801
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:33,590
Rufus... Rufus?

802
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,526
Rufus?

803
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:37,594
Rufus?

804
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:41,031
He's not here.

805
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,099
We lost the dog.

806
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,300
(sighing)

807
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:44,668
This move has been hard
enough on Manny.

808
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,536
If we lost his dog,
he'll hate life forever.

809
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:48,171
Remember when we
had Rufus tagged

810
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,519
with the GPS chip

811
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,208
and you thought it
was a waste of money?

812
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:52,509
(beeping)

813
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,812
I may have been
wrong on that one.

814
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,347
He is at the school?

815
00:31:58,683 --> 00:31:59,950
Let's go!
Give me the keys!

816
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:01,285
You drive too slow!

817
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:03,487
(tires screeching)

818
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:04,621
(cat shrieking)

819
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:05,689
(tires screeching)

820
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,158
Rufus?

821
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,227
Rufus, buddy...
you there?

822
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:11,762
(howling in the distance)

823
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:13,297
Is that you?

824
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:16,500
Look, I'm sorry
I was being such a jerk.

825
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,735
(howling in the distance)

826
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:20,237
Rufus?

827
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:21,838
(howling)

828
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,608
You're not here
for the dance, are you?

829
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,178
Let's go!
Hey, let me go!

830
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:30,948
You're coming
with us, kid.
Where are you taking me?
Help!

831
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,016
(Rufus howling)

832
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:34,017
Manny?

833
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:37,220
(howling continues)

834
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,555
(Manny)
Help, let me go!

835
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,724
(woman)
Let's go!
Let me go!

836
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,125
Help, please!

837
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:43,627
What do you want?!

838
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,495
Rufus?

839
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:47,603
What's wrong?
Manny's in trouble.

840
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:51,668
Manny?!

841
00:32:51,736 --> 00:32:52,970
Manny?!

842
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:53,971
Paige...

843
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:55,138
(tires screeching)

844
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:56,206
those men just
took my best friend

845
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:57,574
but why would they...

846
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,711
They're working for
the squirrels, aren't they?

847
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:01,979
No, Rufus.

848
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:03,326
This is why.

849
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:06,650
All right, I'll bite.

850
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:08,085
What do you want with me?

851
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,319
With you?

852
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:11,989
(chuckling)

853
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:13,657
Nothing.

854
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:14,825
Nothing at all.

855
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:17,327
Think about it.

856
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:18,996
This magic thing, this amulet

857
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:20,103
must have incredible power

858
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:21,298
and be crazy valuable,

859
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:23,300
so someone must be
looking for it.

860
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:25,602
Rufus, we gotta
find Manny right away!

861
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,870
I can do that!

862
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,338
(sniffing)

863
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:29,706
But not with this nose.

864
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:30,774
Follow me.

865
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,610
(barking)

866
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,455
(barking)

867
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,790
Rufus, wait for me!

868
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,227
(Manny)
Where are you taking me?

869
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:53,330
(Mr. Black)
To a place your dear Rufus

870
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,465
won't be able to resist.

871
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:03,206
We've gotta find that dog.

872
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:04,374
Manny will be crushed!

873
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:05,942
Crushed!
Get a grip!

874
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,490
Do not go soft on me!

875
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:10,914
(whimpering)

876
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,683
Come on, Rufus,
don't lose the scent.

877
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:14,818
You can do this.

878
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,086
Find Manny.

879
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,421
Go, Rufus!

880
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,488
I don't like
the looks of this place.

881
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:23,593
Ha.

882
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:25,062
You drag me into a creepy
warehouse

883
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:26,830
in the middle of nowhere
and think I'm gonna worry?

884
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,098
My best friend will find me
wherever you take me.

885
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:31,373
Oh, we're counting on that.

886
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,471
Oh.

887
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:37,140
This is a trap and I'm the bait.

888
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,608

Shh, Rufus.

903
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,336
They took Manny
knowing you'd come for him.

904
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:08,705
They're expecting you
and the amulet.

905
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:15,579
I got an idea.

906
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:17,614
Let's give them
something they don't expect.

00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:18,762
Yeah.
