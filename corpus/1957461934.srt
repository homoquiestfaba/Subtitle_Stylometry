00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,708
We don't wanna join your church.

352
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:06,833
Uh, no. Uh...

353
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:09,750
Is your daughter home?

354
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,458
- Unfortunately, she's not.
- Hi.

355
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:15,125
Hi. I'm Beverly Moody.
I live right over there.

356
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,375
I'm Ellen. I live here.

357
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:18,541
Oh...

358
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:21,434
- [mom in Taiwanese] What's going on?
- [Ellen in English] She's our neighbor.

359
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,684
- [mom in Taiwanese] What are you gonna do?
- [Ellen] Well, we should show courtesy.

360
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,809
- [mom in Taiwanese] Where are you going?
- [Ellen] She's lonely. Okay?

361
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,892
- [mom in Taiwanese] Who else is going?
- [Ellen] She has no other friends.

362
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,666
[mom in Taiwanese]
What time are you coming home?

363
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,541
[Ellen] It's fine. Just two seconds.

364
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:33,833
Wanna go outside?

365
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:38,958
Ellen?

366
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,750
[Ellen] Fine.

367
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,291
Come on, Justin.

368
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:45,333
Come on. He'll follow us. He always does.

369
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,916
[in Taiwanese] Come home by 3:00!

370
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:48,625
[Ellen] Okay.

371
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,791
[Beverly] Is your brother okay?

372
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:56,625
Justin? Yeah. I stare-dared him.

373
00:19:56,708 --> 00:20:00,208
He'll do anything if you stare-dare him,
even if he really doesn't want to.

374
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,541
- It's amazing.
- [thuds loudly]

375
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,208
[giggling]

376
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:06,583
- Want to see?
- Sure.

377
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,208
- Justin.
- [Justin giggles]

378
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,666
I dare you to run to Tukwila.

379
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,000
No way.

380
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:15,583
I double-dare you.

381
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:19,708
Now get off that one.
I don't want to run to Tukwila.

382
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:22,833
[inhales]

383
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:23,875
[exhales]

384
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,416
I stare-dare you.

385
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:33,416
Ugh.

386
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,208
I'll get you, Ellen!

387
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,291
[Ellen giggles]

388
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,125
[Beverly] That is amazing.

389
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,000
Should probably get going now.

390
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,541
[whimsical music playing]

391
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,166
Uh, should we...

392
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,708
No. He'll run out of steam at the Valero.
My dad will get him later.

393
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,083
Have any brothers or sisters?

394
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,833
Nope. Just me and my grandma.

395
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:57,708
Oh. Back in New Jersey,
I had, like, two million cousins.

396
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,375
That's crazy. Why'd you move here?

397
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,000
Hmm. Because of my dad.

398
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,416
He didn't like his old job,
so we came here.

399
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,500
Now he doesn't like this job either,

400
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,458
but my mom says
we can't move all around like vagabonds,

401
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,000
so we're staying.

402
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,750
Has anybody given you
a tour of the neighborhood yet?

403
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,958
No. No one really talks to me.

404
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,250
I could give you a tour.
I've lived here my whole life.

405
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,000
I know the names of all the dogs,

406
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,541
and which ones you can pet,
and which ones will bite you.

407
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:28,208
But first, can you do something for me?

408
00:21:29,041 --> 00:21:29,958
What?

409
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:33,208
[Beverly] So you listen to this
and tell me what it says. Okay?

410
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,291
[Ellen] Okay.

411
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,583
[man on recording] <i>The road
might seem long and arduous.</i>

412
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,506
[Ellen] It's just some guy
talking about roads.

413
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,333
- It's after that.
- ["Linda, Linda" plays]

414
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,000
[man singing in Japanese]

415
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,583
This is Japanese.

416
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:50,750
I'm Taiwanese.

417
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:53,791
[whispers] Ugh. Oh shiitake mushrooms!

418
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,083
[Ellen] Uh...

419
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:58,291
Can I still get that tour?

420
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:01,041
[both giggling]

421
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,208
[whimsical orchestral music playing]

422
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,666
That's where two men live, Les and Ray.

423
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,666
They dress their dogs in sweaters,
even in the summer.

424
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,000
I asked him once,

425
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:13,041
"Why do you dress your dog
in sweaters even in the summer?"

426
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:16,333
And Ray said,
"Fashion before comfort, sweetie."

427
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:17,416
[both giggle]

428
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:19,583
Animals wearing people clothes

429
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:22,458
is pretty much my favorite thing
in the whole world.

430
00:22:25,416 --> 00:22:28,333
[loudly] This corner is famous.
It was on <i>Cops </i>once.

431
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:30,096
This guy got pulled over, and he was like,

432
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:31,708
"I don't have no drugs."

433
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:33,208
And then the cops were like,

434
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:35,458
"Then what's that pipe doing
on your seat then?"

435
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:36,875
And then he just started running,

436
00:22:36,958 --> 00:22:40,416
and they caught him by his ponytail
and arrested him right here,

437
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,375
and he just kept hollering,
"Call my old lady," over and over.

438
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:48,541
- [exhales]
- [Ellen] <i>Did that really happen?</i>

439
00:22:49,166 --> 00:22:51,846
[Beverly] I watched it on TV
with my grandma, but she turned it off.

440
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,625
[Ellen] How come you live
with your grandma?

441
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:56,541
[Beverly] Um, 'cause my parents are gone.

442
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,833
[Ellen] Where'd they go?

443
00:22:57,916 --> 00:23:00,750
[Beverly] They died when I was two,
so I never really got to know them.

444
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:02,041
[Ellen] How'd they die?

445
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:03,125
[Beverly] Car wreck.

446
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:04,208
[Ellen] Huh.

447
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,541
[Beverly] Hey. What's your GPA?

448
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,583
[Beverly] Grandma.

449
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:11,666
[woman] Yeah?

450
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:14,250
- Can I have a friend over?
- Huh?

451
00:23:16,958 --> 00:23:19,750
I'm Ellen.
I have a 3.87 GPA, all my shots,

452
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,958
and parents who'd never let me
watch junk television.

453
00:23:22,041 --> 00:23:23,041
[sighs]

454
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:25,708
My grandparents
lived through war and famine,

455
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:27,791
so I'm not allowed to complain
about my homework.

456
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:28,916
- Hmm.
- Whoa!

457
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,583
Your parents tell you all that stuff?

458
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:32,041
[scoffs] Are you kidding?

459
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:35,416
They never miss out on a chance
to point out life is a living nightmare.

460
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,291
Are they worried about Y2K?

461
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:38,958
- Hmm. The millennium bug.
- Yeah.

462
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:42,666
Yeah, no. Uh, my dad actually hopes
that things go haywire,

463
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,250
and all our debt gets erased.

464
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:45,750
- Mmm!
- And, um, hey, you know,

465
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:49,708
if the world really does come to an end,
at least we don't have to keep suffering.

466
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:53,041
Oh. This is delicious, Mrs. Moody.

467
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,833
Oh. Thank you. I, um...

468
00:23:55,416 --> 00:23:56,500
I grill the Spam.

469
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:58,166
It really brings out the salt.

470
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,208
- Hmm.
- Hey. Wanna see something cool?

471
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:01,833
[Ellen] Oh. Okay.

472
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:04,083
- Thanks, Grandma.
- Thanks for the dinner, Mrs. Moody.

473
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:05,416
Uh, girls...

474
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,541
- [footsteps receding]
- [sighs]

475
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:10,416
[Ellen] They don't look like parents.

476
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,267
[Beverly] My mom had me when she was 16.
My grandma was a teen mom too.

477
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:15,833
It's called babies having babies.
I saw it on <i>Maury.</i>

478
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,541
[clatters loudly]

479
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:19,625
[Ellen] Sorry!

480
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,250
Um, i-is your table made of Spam?

481
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:24,333
If Y2K takes everything down,

482
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:26,791
this place is a bunker
for at least nine months.

483
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:28,541
Your grandma's really into Y2K.

484
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:32,166
She doesn't want anything bad
to happen to us.

485
00:24:35,416 --> 00:24:37,041
This is me with my mom and dad.

486
00:24:37,791 --> 00:24:39,791
- [Ellen] Oh.
- I never really knew them,

487
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:43,916
but the other night, I woke up and saw
someone trying to shoot bottle rockets.

488
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:47,000
And then I found this.

489
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,125
- I think it might be a sign.
- [gasps]

490
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:50,916
A message from your parents?

491
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,125
Yeah. But I'm not sure
what they're trying to tell me.

492
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:56,911
I think I have to find all the songs
before I'll know.

493
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:59,375
Hmm. Have you told your grandma?

494
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:02,875
She gets kind of weird
when I ask about them.

495
00:25:03,375 --> 00:25:04,750
I mean, I know she loved them,

496
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:07,666
but maybe she blames them
for messing up their lives.

497
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:10,583
- Hmm.
- Besides, she's got enough going on.

498
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:13,041
- Hmm.
- [sighs]

499
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:14,166
I think I can help.

500
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:18,166
It's this new thing called Napster.
All the songs are free.

501
00:25:18,666 --> 00:25:21,375
[Beverly] Wow!
How do you know about this stuff?

502
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:24,708
I don't really have friends,
so I spend a lot of time on my computer.

503
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:27,458
- Which song do you wanna hear?
- Just the next one.

504
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,666
I have to listen to it in order.

505
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,083
It's, like, mixtape law.

506
00:25:32,166 --> 00:25:33,486
And if there really is a message,

507
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:36,291
then I need to listen to it
the way my parents made it.

508
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:38,125
[Ellen] Cool. All right.

509
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:39,916
[inhales] Uh...

510
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
[whispers] Okay.

511
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,916
[keyboard clacking]

512
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:45,458
[computer quacks]

513
00:25:45,541 --> 00:25:46,541
Hmm.

514
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:50,333
[Ellen smacks lips] Uh...

515
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:54,208
- [keyboard clacking]
- [Ellen] Okay. [sighs, sniffles]

516
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,125
[computer whirring]

517
00:25:56,625 --> 00:26:01,166
[sighs] Well, I couldn't find
the third one, but I have the one after.

518
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,500
It's called "I Got A Right"
by The Stooges.

519
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,500
Wanna hear it?

520
00:26:06,875 --> 00:26:10,041

1383
01:09:37,625 --> 01:09:40,875
She smiled, like, all the time. Okay?

1384
01:09:43,041 --> 01:09:45,375
I'm sure it's all because
she listened to music.

1385
01:09:45,458 --> 01:09:47,500
It's well-known
that rock and roll causes kids

1386
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:49,291
to worship Satan and hate sweaters.

1387
01:09:49,375 --> 01:09:50,625
[Gail] That's not funny.

1388

[Anti] Lady!

1391
01:09:56,666 --> 01:09:57,666
Gran Moody.

1392
01:09:58,500 --> 01:09:59,333
[Gail sighs]

1393
01:09:59,416 --> 01:10:00,458
Listen.

1394
01:10:01,166 --> 01:10:02,333
I like Beverly.

1395
01:10:02,416 --> 01:10:04,083
I don't know why, but I do.

1396
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:07,250
And I'm probably the last person
you should take advice from on this,

1397
01:10:07,958 --> 01:10:11,416
but she's obviously searching
for something, and...

1398
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:12,500
[inhales deeply]

1399
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:14,291
...maybe just take it easy on her.

1400
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:16,375
That's it?

1401
01:10:16,958 --> 01:10:18,166
That's your advice?

1402
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:21,791
You came out here
to tell me to take it easy?

1403
01:10:22,916 --> 01:10:24,458
Yeah, yeah. I guess.

1404
01:10:25,166 --> 01:10:26,166
Huh.

1405
01:10:26,958 --> 01:10:29,541
So maybe I'll just let her run wild. Huh?

1406
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:32,833
Yeah. And maybe she'll get pregnant at 15

1407
01:10:32,916 --> 01:10:35,125
and then get in a car crash and die.

1408
01:10:36,166 --> 01:10:37,208
[truck door closes]

1409
01:10:37,291 --> 01:10:39,541
'Cause that's what happens. You know?

1410
01:10:39,625 --> 01:10:42,666
That's what happens
when you "take it easy."

1411
01:10:43,208 --> 01:10:46,416
People die, Mr. Record Store Guy.

1412
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:48,125
Thanks for the advice.

1413
01:10:52,208 --> 01:10:57,666
Wildcats! Wildcats! Wildcats! Wildcats!

1414
01:10:57,750 --> 01:11:00,166
Wildcats! Wildcats!

1415
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:01,750
Dude, why are you icing us?

1416
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:04,416
- [Beverly] Why are you following me?
- We're friends.

1417
01:11:04,916 --> 01:11:05,916
Are we?

1418
01:11:06,625 --> 01:11:09,250
Ever since we started hanging out,
my grades are slipping,

1419
01:11:09,333 --> 01:11:11,291
I'm sneaking behind my grandma's back,

1420
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:13,791
I went to the principal's office
for the first time,

1421
01:11:14,291 --> 01:11:16,541
I found out I ruined my parents' lives.

1422
01:11:17,041 --> 01:11:18,708
All kids ruin their parents' lives.

1423
01:11:18,791 --> 01:11:21,083
- That's why your friends...
- We're not friends!

1424
01:11:24,625 --> 01:11:25,625
Or if we are,

1425
01:11:26,666 --> 01:11:28,083
it's just because we're all losers.

1426
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:32,625
And after everything my grandma's done,
I'm not gonna throw it all away

1427
01:11:32,708 --> 01:11:35,166
and end up like my mom,
making the same mistakes that...

1428
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:36,416
Your mom

1429
01:11:37,708 --> 01:11:39,250
didn't make a mistake.

1430
01:11:39,333 --> 01:11:42,541
What? Your mom totally made a mistake.
Look how she turned out.

1431
01:11:43,583 --> 01:11:44,833
- [air hisses]
- [crowd gasps]

1432

1434
01:11:49,166 --> 01:11:50,166
[principal] Beverly.

1435
01:11:55,666 --> 01:11:57,000
Mr. and Mrs. Gonzales,

1436
01:11:57,083 --> 01:12:00,291
I wonder if I might take a moment
to talk to you about Steven's bullying.

1437
01:12:00,375 --> 01:12:02,000
[Steven] Huh? Wait. What?

1438
01:12:02,875 --> 01:12:03,875
Thank you.

1439
01:12:07,375 --> 01:12:08,375
[door opening]

1440
01:12:08,875 --> 01:12:10,416
[Gail] No! No.

1441
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:13,083
- [door closes]
- You are not going anywhere until you ex...

1442
01:12:13,583 --> 01:12:16,333
Suspended? No. You're grounded.

1443
01:12:16,416 --> 01:12:17,416
[Beverly] Okay.

1444
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:18,750
Oh.

1445
01:12:18,833 --> 01:12:21,666
You're, like, next-level grounded.

1446
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:24,208
Like, you're not
gonna see your friends anymore.

1447
01:12:24,291 --> 01:12:26,250
- Okay.
- Like, ever.

1448
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:27,333
Okay.

1449
01:12:34,541 --> 01:12:36,083
You're supposed to be the good one.

1450
01:12:36,166 --> 01:12:39,875
I guess I'm just another mistake
in a long line of mistakes.

1451
01:12:39,958 --> 01:12:41,541
What are you talking about?

1452
01:12:42,583 --> 01:12:44,083
I screwed up Mom's life

1453
01:12:44,833 --> 01:12:46,541
just like she screwed up yours.

1454
01:12:46,625 --> 01:12:48,083
[sighs] No, Beverly...

1455
01:12:48,583 --> 01:12:49,583
Am I wrong?

1456
01:12:49,958 --> 01:12:52,208
It just seems
like everybody in this family

1457
01:12:52,291 --> 01:12:53,708
is either unhappy or dead.

1458
01:12:54,291 --> 01:12:55,291
Go to your room.

1459
01:12:56,833 --> 01:13:00,416
Perfect. So we can avoid talking
about my mom again.

1460
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:05,666
I gave you an entire box of her stuff.
What more do you want?

1461
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:09,458
I wanna know if she and I
would've liked the same things.

1462
01:13:09,541 --> 01:13:12,208
Who cares
if you would've liked the same things?

1463
01:13:12,291 --> 01:13:15,125
Because then I could know
if maybe she would've liked me.

1464
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:17,958
[breath shuddering]

1465
01:13:18,041 --> 01:13:19,750
Of course she would've liked you.

1466
01:13:20,791 --> 01:13:23,500
She had to love me,
but she didn't have to like me.

1467
01:13:27,041 --> 01:13:28,041
I like you.

1468
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:29,750
Do you?

1469
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:33,333
[sniffles] When was
the last time I made you laugh?

1470
01:13:33,416 --> 01:13:36,208
Oh, honey. I'm too busy to laugh.

1471
01:13:36,958 --> 01:13:40,333
I know. And I know
everything you're doing is for me,

1472
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:43,000
but sometimes it just feels like...

1473
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:45,500
Like...

1474
01:13:46,041 --> 01:13:47,500
[whimpers, sighs]

1475
01:13:48,333 --> 01:13:50,333

01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:22,916
Yeah.

[doorbell chimes]

[pop music playing]

1481
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,416
So, how long have you, uh, been...

1482
01:14:35,083 --> 01:14:36,791
Angry? Alone?

1483
01:14:36,875 --> 01:14:37,708
Here?

1484
01:14:37,791 --> 01:14:38,791
Here.

1485
01:14:40,833 --> 01:14:41,833
Sixteen years.

1486
01:14:41,916 --> 01:14:42,916
[Gail] Oh.

1487
01:14:44,458 --> 01:14:46,000
Postal worker of the year?

1488
01:14:46,083 --> 01:14:49,083
[sighs] Eleven years running.

1489
01:14:49,583 --> 01:14:53,083
Except '96, they gave it to Earl Boggs.

1490
01:14:53,166 --> 01:14:54,750
Yeah. Well, he had cancer, so...

1491
01:14:54,833 --> 01:14:55,833
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

1492
01:14:56,791 --> 01:14:58,166
All right. I have to ask.

1493
01:14:58,666 --> 01:15:02,250
Did you really think
that I was selling drugs?

1494
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:04,500
No.

1495
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:05,708
[scoffs]

1496
01:15:05,791 --> 01:15:07,333
Eh, maybe. I don't know.

1497
01:15:07,416 --> 01:15:10,166
I don't think you have to worry
about any of that with Beverly.

1498
01:15:10,791 --> 01:15:12,250
She's a good kid.

1499
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:13,750
Absolute pain in the butt...

1500

[chuckles softly]

1501

1502
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,875
You're doing a really good job.

1503
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:23,291
She's a great kid,
but that's <i>no</i> thanks to me.

1504
01:15:25,875 --> 01:15:28,666
Mm. She's getting into these years when

1505
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:33,500
I don't know how to keep her good.

1506
01:15:39,333 --> 01:15:40,250
I should take off.

1507
01:15:40,333 --> 01:15:41,625
- [Anti] I, um...
- No.

1508
01:15:42,666 --> 01:15:44,500
I've lost people close to me too

1509
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:49,166
and wasted years not dealing with it,

1510
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:50,666
and looking back...

1511
01:15:52,583 --> 01:15:56,500
what I regret the most
is I hid from the people that were there,

1512
01:15:56,583 --> 01:15:59,458
and I stopped noticing them

1513
01:16:00,416 --> 01:16:02,500
and letting them notice me.

1514
01:16:07,208 --> 01:16:08,666
[inhales] Thanks for the Tab.

1515
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,208
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1516
01:16:11,291 --> 01:16:12,291
Yeah.

1517
01:16:13,125 --> 01:16:14,517
- Yeah. I'll take that.
- Okay. Yeah.

1518
01:16:14,541 --> 01:16:15,875
I'll... I'll keep that.

1519
01:16:16,458 --> 01:16:18,166
[Gail inhales] All right.

1520
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:20,208
[melancholy jazz piano music playing]

1521
01:16:25,125 --> 01:16:26,125
[Ellen] Hey!

1522
01:16:26,458 --> 01:16:27,458
[Beverly] Hey.

1523
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:31,041
This is, like, the first time
I've seen you outside in a while.

1524
01:16:32,166 --> 01:16:33,166
Yeah.

1525
01:16:33,541 --> 01:16:35,958
- Suspended.
- Mm.

1526
01:16:36,041 --> 01:16:38,041
I'm not supposed to hang out
with you either

1527
01:16:38,125 --> 01:16:40,083
because you might be a bad influence.

1528
01:16:40,166 --> 01:16:42,833
But then I stare-dared Justin
to take a bath in butter,

1529
01:16:42,916 --> 01:16:46,333
and my parents forgot about me
and my impressionable, young mind.

Country Crock out of his ears.

Ew.

01:16:50,833 --> 01:16:52,458
[Ellen giggles] Yeah.

1533
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,833
I have the next song.

1534
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:00,208
Uh, you should keep it.
I'm done with that stuff.

1535
01:17:00,708 --> 01:17:02,291
Uh, yeah. [inhales]

1536

Nicky said you'd say that,
but, um, you should listen to it.

01:17:07,083 --> 01:17:08,125

to tell you something?

What if there's something magical?

1542
01:17:20,291 --> 01:17:23,791
There isn't, Ellen. They're just... dead.
