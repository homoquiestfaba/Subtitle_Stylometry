[Carrie] <i>Sometimes it's
painful to be inarticulate.</i>

2
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,678
<i>You know, to never
have the right thing</i>

3
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:46,614
<i>To say when it really matters.</i>

4
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:50,384
<i>Like you might spend
your entire life</i>

5
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,219
<i>thinking you're
dealing with a square</i>

6
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,130
<i>because it looks like a
square and acts like a square</i>

7
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:57,559
<i>or feels like whatever.</i>

8
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,227
<i>But then one day,</i>

9
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,696
<i>you turn a corner and realize</i>

10
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:05,065
<i>that actually it's not a square.</i>

11
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,602

12
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:09,671

60
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:59,607
Oh, yeah. I always forget he
was in our Hebrew School class.

61
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,042
He smiled at me.

62
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:02,643
No, he didn't.

63
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:03,778
Look.

(sighs)

65
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:10,818
No, that's just his face.

66
00:04:10,852 --> 00:04:12,385
He always looks like that.

67
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,287
Jealous much?

68
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,790
Definitely not.

69
00:04:19,594 --> 00:04:22,063
Oh, sorry.

70
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,598
Don't be.

71
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:26,667
Okay, cool.

72
00:04:26,701 --> 00:04:30,303
You, you look really nice.

73
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:32,607
Um, thanks.

74
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,810
You look... I mean you look
like really, really good.

75
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:37,444
(laughing)

76
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,013
- You think so?
- Yeah.

77
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:41,516
I mean, duh. (laughs)

78
00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:42,984
You're, like, really cute.

79
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:15,082
This is some real
premium stuff, okay.

80
00:05:15,116 --> 00:05:18,619
So you can only take a
little bit of it at a time.

81
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:34,035
I heard it was 20.

82
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:35,468
20 what?

83
00:05:36,037 --> 00:05:37,572
20 pills.

84
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,342
I ate an Advil once because
I thought it was a red M&M.

85
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:54,522

Shh!

111
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:29,243
It is now my honor to
invite Samantha's cousin,

112
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:32,113
Sarah Bronstein,
for her remarks.

113
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:34,015
Sarah.

114
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:45,026
Hello, everyone. My
name is Sarah Bronstein.

115
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:48,095
Samantha is... was my cousin.

116
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:51,032
Even though we were less
than a year apart in age,

117
00:08:51,065 --> 00:08:54,568
I've always seen Samantha as
the big sister I never had.

118
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:59,673
My name is David Gold, and I
am Samantha's piano teacher.

119
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:03,344
We never know when a tragedy
will strike our community,

120
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,846
but we do know that
we, as a community,

121
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,315
will come together
after the tragedy.

122
00:09:08,349 --> 00:09:10,785
She had this
connection to horses

123
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:12,686
that I'll never be
able to understand.

124
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,322
And Samantha became
a brilliant pianist.

125
00:09:15,356 --> 00:09:19,026
In her 18 years, she studied
Torah here at Temple Beth El.

126
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,730
And because of her, I can
ride both Western and English.

127
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,098
She was very young.

128
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:25,199
I had the honor

129
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,168
of officiating at the service

130
00:09:27,201 --> 00:09:29,203
when she became a bat mitzvah.

131
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:32,807
And I give my condolences
to the family.

132
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,876
And I, for one, am going
to miss her very much.

133
00:09:36,644 --> 00:09:38,179
Thank you.

134
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:55,996
I will now recite the
Kel Moleh Rachamim,

135
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,865

136
00:09:57,898 --> 00:09:59,100
Would you kindly rise?

139
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:57,324
There will be a luncheon in
the pastoral conference room

140
00:10:57,358 --> 00:11:00,361

be collecting donations

141
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:04,465

Carrie, Hannah,

145
00:11:46,307 --> 00:11:49,944
oh, thank you so
much for coming.

146
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:52,246
- Of course, Mrs. Goldstein.
- Yeah, of course.

147
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:56,116
I haven't seen you since you
all were in that musical.

148
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,219
- Do you remember that?
- Mm-hmm.

149
00:11:58,252 --> 00:12:00,921
Oh, listen to me. Of
course, you remember.

150
00:12:00,955 --> 00:12:03,324
Samantha loved musicals.

151
00:12:03,357 --> 00:12:05,893
I don't know if a lot
of people knew that.

152
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:09,930
She would always sing that
<i>Annie</i> song in the shower.

153
00:12:09,964 --> 00:12:11,932
You know, the "Tomorrow" one?

154
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:14,268
- "Tomorrow"?
- Yes, right.

155
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:15,503
That's it.

156
00:12:15,537 --> 00:12:18,405
<i>♪ Tomorrow ♪</i>

157
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:20,474
She had such a good voice.

158
00:12:20,508 --> 00:12:23,978
Yeah, I remember we were in
eighth grade choir together.

159
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:26,013
She was so great.

160
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:28,082
Yeah, she was like
really, really good.

161
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:30,818
Oh, that's so nice
of you girls to say.

162
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:33,153
You know, she thought
the world of you two.

163
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:35,022
Especially you, Hannah.

164
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:38,926
It was so nice seeing pictures
of you two at that big party.

165
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,061
- Totally.
- You looked so pretty.

166
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:42,296
Thanks.

167
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:46,233
Oh, I should probably
stop rambling.

168
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:48,002
I know Samantha would
die of embarrassment

169
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:52,039
if she knew I was
carrying on like this.

170
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:57,244
- (crying) - I'm so sorry for
your loss, Mrs. Goldstein.

171
00:12:57,278 --> 00:12:58,445
Yeah. So sorry.

172
00:12:58,479 --> 00:12:59,947
So, so sorry.

173
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,048
Thank you, girls.

174
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:03,050
If you'll excuse me.

175
00:13:16,598 --> 00:13:19,066
Uh, what did she mean by that?

176
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:20,467
What?

177
00:13:20,502 --> 00:13:23,971
I just didn't know that

178
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:26,349
you and Samantha took a picture
together at Melissa's party.

179
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:28,909
Oh, I don't know. I
don't really remember,

180
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:31,979
but I wasn't gonna,
like, correct her.

181
00:13:34,616 --> 00:13:37,017
- But...
- Ugh, I'm starving.

182
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:38,094
I think I'm gonna have a bagel.

183
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:39,353
Do you want the other half?

184
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:41,422
No, I'm not really hungry.

185
00:13:42,356 --> 00:13:44,158
Hmm, your loss.

186
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:46,293
(laughter)

187
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,864
Can you believe that?

188
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:53,167
It's so sad.

189
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,170
Don't they know that Tristan
would never go for any of them.

190
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:58,272
Bad bone structure.

191
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:04,878
- This is so messed up.
- Oh, totally.

192
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:06,590
It's, like, Elaina's
pretty and everything,

193
00:14:06,614 --> 00:14:09,083
but she's not,
like, a real person.

194
00:14:11,586 --> 00:14:13,621
I'm gonna go get a cup of water.

195
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:16,490
Could you get me some?

196
00:14:16,524 --> 00:14:18,359
(chatter continues)

197
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:37,911
(chatter is muffled)

198
00:14:39,113 --> 00:14:41,248
(chatter resumes)

199
00:14:51,693 --> 00:14:53,427
- Here.
- Thanks.

200
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:09,376
- Oh, my God, are you crying?
- What? No.

201
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,979
- Your eyes are red.
- Yeah, because of, like,

202
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:14,516
air pollution or whatever.

203
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:16,584
Stop being... weird.

204
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:26,226
Do you think Tristan
owns that suit?

205
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,295
I don't know.

206
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:31,398
It just looks so good on him.

207
00:15:31,432 --> 00:15:33,701
Like, he looks
really, really good.

208
00:15:33,735 --> 00:15:35,202
Yeah.

209
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:37,605
He got hotter, right?

210
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:38,740
I guess?

211
00:15:38,773 --> 00:15:40,941
You guess?

212
00:15:41,676 --> 00:15:43,645
I just don't think

213
00:15:43,678 --> 00:15:45,979
we should be talking
about this right now.

214
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:47,281
Why?

215
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:50,050
Because we're at
a funeral service.

216
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,052
You didn't even
know her that well.

217
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:55,456
She was in, like,
my AP Psych class.

218
00:15:58,058 --> 00:15:59,393
She was nice.

219
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:02,095
We worked on a group
project together.

220
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:04,031
Didn't you say you had
to do all the work?

221
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:06,142
Yeah, no one ever does the
work in, like, a group project.

222
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,101
I remember you being,
like, really mad

223
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:09,547
because she said she would help
you with the presentation part

224
00:16:09,571 --> 00:16:11,405
and then she, like,
totally ghosted you.

225
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:13,149
I mean, she clearly had
other things on her mind.

226
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:15,375
It doesn't matter, just...

227
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:17,010
I just don't think
we should be talking

228
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:19,681
about Tristan's suit
right now, okay?

229
00:16:26,588 --> 00:16:29,156
Are you sure you
don't want a bite?

230
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:31,191
Yeah.

231
00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:34,261
Ugh, fine. I gotta pee.

232
00:16:40,802 --> 00:16:43,470
(toilet flushes)

233
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,074
What took you so long?

234
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:48,375
You know I pee slow.

235
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:50,344
That's why I had
to quit swim team.

236
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:53,380
You quit swim team
because you hated running.

237
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:56,250
Well, why should I have
to run for swim practice?

238
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:59,253
That's unfair and stupid.

239
00:17:01,556 --> 00:17:04,792
Ugh, I'm so bored.

240
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:10,430
I mean, today has
been, like, so, so sad,

241
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:12,165
but now I just want to go home.

242
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,636
I don't want to go to the
stupid Teen Talk Back.

243
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:16,303
Those things are always so dumb.

244
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:18,272
I don't know. I feel
like the best part of USY

245
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:21,341
was always the
intellectual debates.

246
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,778
(laughs) Or that was
probably hard for you

247
00:17:23,811 --> 00:17:26,113
with someone's tongue down
your throat the whole time.

248
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:28,248
I found that pretty
stimulating actually.

249
00:17:28,282 --> 00:17:30,752
- (laughs)
- You're so gross.

250
00:17:30,785 --> 00:17:33,420
Okay. At least I didn't
have Ben Schwartz's hands

251
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:34,789
down my pants like somebody.

252
00:17:34,822 --> 00:17:36,824
Yeah, you had Ben Feldman's.

253
00:17:36,858 --> 00:17:41,128
True. At least him
stabbing me in the vagina

254
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:44,699
with his boiled fingers
was more fun than today.

255
00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:47,802
He was, like, trying to get
a peanut out of a tiny bag.

256
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,471
I want to hook up with
someone who's experienced

257
00:17:51,506 --> 00:17:53,106
like me, you know?

258
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,175
You've hooked up with,
like, three guys.

259
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,448
Okay, you've hooked up with one

260
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:57,879
and you kept your jeans on.

261
00:17:57,912 --> 00:17:59,681
What? I'm just saying,

262
00:17:59,714 --> 00:18:01,348
if this was a
competition, I would win.

263
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:03,551
Yeah, I'm sure you would.

264
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:06,219
Okay.

265
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,732
Do you think I'm pretty?

266
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,668
Don't be stupid.

267
00:18:20,702 --> 00:18:22,235
I think I'm like okay-looking.

268
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,806
I'm not classically
beautiful or whatever.

269
00:18:25,807 --> 00:18:27,909
My nose is weird.

270
00:18:27,942 --> 00:18:31,244
Stop it, you're pretty.

271
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:34,247
Would you ever kill yourself?

272
00:18:34,949 --> 00:18:37,284
No, I don't think so.

273
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:38,853
Neither would I.

274
00:18:38,886 --> 00:18:40,220
But if I did, which I wouldn't,

275
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:42,222
I'd do what Samantha did.

276
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,592
Pills are so easy.

277
00:18:44,626 --> 00:18:45,869
I guess you could hang yourself,

278
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:48,563
but that'd be kind of hard.

279
00:18:48,596 --> 00:18:50,440
Slitting your wrists in
the bathtub could be cool

280
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:53,433
but it's so emo middle
school, you know?

281
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:54,669
Ugh.

282
00:18:55,402 --> 00:18:56,638
Shit.

283
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,143
Do you have concealer?

284
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:06,581
Concealer?

285
00:19:06,614 --> 00:19:07,815
Do you have some?

286
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:09,717
Like, in your purse?

287
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,889
For me, yes.

288
00:19:14,922 --> 00:19:17,157
For, you, no.

289
00:19:20,962 --> 00:19:22,462
Whatever.

290
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:24,498
You can hardly see it anyway.

291
00:19:27,935 --> 00:19:30,404
Do you think Tristan's
a good kisser?

292
00:19:30,905 --> 00:19:32,540
No clue.

293
00:19:32,573 --> 00:19:34,976
Rachel Feinstein says
he's, like, really good,

294
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:36,644
but she's a pathological liar.

295
00:19:36,678 --> 00:19:38,780
So, who knows if
that's even true.

296
00:19:40,581 --> 00:19:42,583
Wait, didn't
Tristan and Samantha

297
00:19:42,617 --> 00:19:44,284
used to hook up?

298
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:46,420
Oh, yeah, I heard about that.

299
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:48,990
But then he took Lauren
Silverstein to homecoming.

300
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:52,225
I remember seeing them
kiss during the slow dance.

301
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:54,529
So tragic. (laughing)

302
00:20:00,702 --> 00:20:03,705
I wonder if I'm a good kisser.

303
00:20:03,738 --> 00:20:08,009
I thought you were
"so experienced".

304
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:11,846
Well, I never,
like, dated anybody.

305
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:13,548
So?

306
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:17,317
So, I haven't exactly had
any returning customers.

307
00:20:38,973 --> 00:20:42,777
What? Why are you looking
at me like that? Stop!

308
00:20:43,878 --> 00:20:45,913
- Kiss me.
- What? No.

309
00:20:45,947 --> 00:20:47,515
- Do it.
- No.

310
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:48,926
Please, I need to
know if I'm, like,

311
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,785
the worst kisser in the world.

312
00:20:50,818 --> 00:20:53,020
Okay, I can tell you right
now, you're probably not

313
00:20:53,054 --> 00:20:54,822
the worst kisser in the world.

314
00:20:54,856 --> 00:20:58,425
Just pretend I'm like Zack
Horowitz or something.

315
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,994
Zack Horowitz has back hair.

316
00:21:00,027 --> 00:21:03,330
Okay, fine, pretend
I'm someone else.

317
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:06,934
- Pretend I'm Mr. Danielson.
- Stop.

318
00:21:06,968 --> 00:21:10,470
I know you think he's so hot
when he pours those beakers.

319
00:21:10,505 --> 00:21:13,373
"Oh, Mr. D, will
you come over here

320
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:14,842
and help me with something?

321
00:21:14,876 --> 00:21:16,844
Oops, I dropped a beaker.

322
00:21:16,878 --> 00:21:18,411
I know that's a safety hazard."

323
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:20,982
I don't want to
kiss Mr. Danielson.

324
00:21:21,015 --> 00:21:22,817
- Then kiss me.
- No!

325
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:23,885
Come on, just do it.

326
00:21:23,918 --> 00:21:25,987
It'll be like a second.

327
00:21:29,123 --> 00:21:30,591
Fine.

328
00:21:33,628 --> 00:21:35,395
- That doesn't count.
- Yes, it does!

329
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:37,965
You asked me to kiss
you, so I kissed you.

330
00:21:37,999 --> 00:21:41,035
Okay, there's no way you
determined anything from that.

331
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:45,706
Okay, fine.

332
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,809
All right, well, I
guess I'll never know

333
00:21:47,842 --> 00:21:49,777
if I'm a good kisser or not.

334
00:21:49,811 --> 00:21:51,555
And then one day, I'll kiss
someone and they'll be like,

335
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:53,948
"That was awful."
And I'll die of shame

336
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:56,050
because my best friend was too-

337
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,358
(ethereal music)

338
00:22:20,842 --> 00:22:22,109
[Hannah] How's that?

339
00:22:25,847 --> 00:22:27,048
Bad?

340
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,586
Okay.

341
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:33,621
Cool.

342
00:22:35,056 --> 00:22:37,024
- Good.
- (both laughing)

343
00:22:37,725 --> 00:22:39,060
Cool.

344
00:22:39,861 --> 00:22:41,128
Thanks.

345
00:22:42,096 --> 00:22:43,798
Yeah, totally.

346
00:22:47,068 --> 00:22:50,605
Ladies, what did I tell
you about being in here?

347
00:22:50,638 --> 00:22:52,506
- Sorry, Moreh Klein.
- We were just leaving.

348
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,643
Good. See you in my classroom
in five minutes, correct?

349
00:22:55,676 --> 00:22:57,044
- Yep!
- Mm-hmm.

350
00:22:57,078 --> 00:23:00,147
(door opens, then closes)

351
00:23:02,617 --> 00:23:05,052
Ugh, I can't believe she's
the one running the talkback.

352
00:23:05,086 --> 00:23:07,088
It's like Hebrew
School, but worse.

353
00:23:07,121 --> 00:23:10,024
Yeah, I think her real job
is in grief counseling.

354
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:11,959
Truly the last
person on the planet

355
00:23:11,993 --> 00:23:13,426
I'd want to counsel my grief.

356
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,896
(both laugh)

357
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:16,206
All right, we
should probably go.

358
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,566
Yeah, yeah, um...

359
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:20,601
I just need to grab my...

360
00:23:20,635 --> 00:23:22,435
- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.

361
00:23:26,574 --> 00:23:28,509
Carrie, Carrie, Carrie.

362
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:31,444
Kill me. (laughing)

363
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,848
Ugh.

364
00:23:37,051 --> 00:23:39,820
- Did you see it?
- Did you see it?

365
00:23:39,854 --> 00:23:41,622
- Did you see it?
- You didn't see it?

366
00:23:41,656 --> 00:23:42,723
You didn't see it.

367
00:23:42,757 --> 00:23:44,191
You have to look with your eyes.

368
00:23:44,225 --> 00:23:45,593
You've got two of them.

369
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:47,460
I'm gonna play it one more time.

370
00:23:53,935 --> 00:23:57,171
Look who's crying again.

371
00:23:57,204 --> 00:24:00,942
- (girl speaking in Hebrew)
- (both laughing)

372
00:24:02,643 --> 00:24:04,912
Why do they do that?

373
00:24:04,946 --> 00:24:06,747
Because they can.

374
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,818
Everyone.

375
00:24:10,851 --> 00:24:12,452
Please settle down.

376
00:24:19,093 --> 00:24:21,829
(footsteps)

377
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:31,906
Shalom.

378
00:24:31,939 --> 00:24:33,641
[Class] Shalom.

379
00:24:35,042 --> 00:24:36,610
Today is a terrible day.

380
00:24:36,644 --> 00:24:38,546
(girl crying)

381
00:24:39,814 --> 00:24:42,616
But we have this
time now to process

382
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:46,187
what the Jewish tradition
teaches us about death,

383
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,657
so we can grieve and
be stronger together.

384
00:24:50,992 --> 00:24:52,760
I know this is difficult.

385
00:24:52,793 --> 00:24:56,697
I was in a similar situation
when I was your age.

386
00:24:56,731 --> 00:25:00,735
At that time, I was
fighting for Israel.

387
00:25:00,768 --> 00:25:03,137
Back then, I saw death
around every corner.

388
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:06,207
I was haunted like a phantom.

389
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,009
When I slept, I dreamt it.

390
00:25:08,042 --> 00:25:09,744
When I woke, I saw it.

391
00:25:10,778 --> 00:25:12,947
And to see someone so young

392
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:17,651
choose to leave this
world of the living,

393
00:25:17,685 --> 00:25:21,288
well, I cannot explain it
and I cannot justify it,

394
00:25:21,322 --> 00:25:25,960
but, as the Talmud tells us,
we must try to understand.

395
00:25:28,796 --> 00:25:30,264
Now,

396
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:34,535
please take these handouts.

397
00:26:00,628 --> 00:26:04,365
Who would've thought they'd
have handouts for this?

398
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:06,267
This is better
than the workbooks

399
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,737
with the mice on them.
Do you remember those?

400
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:12,106
(girl crying)

401
00:26:12,139 --> 00:26:14,008
Okay, I guess not.

402
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:16,143
[Moreh] Does everyone have one?

403
00:26:16,177 --> 00:26:17,678
Good.

404
00:26:17,711 --> 00:26:19,847
Now, who would
like to read aloud?

405
00:26:20,648 --> 00:26:22,616
Hmm, Hila.

406
00:26:25,386 --> 00:26:27,321
"Death is something
that happens to people

407
00:26:27,354 --> 00:26:30,057
of all religions, but
in the Jewish faith,

408
00:26:30,091 --> 00:26:31,992
there are particular
rituals that must be done

409
00:26:32,026 --> 00:26:35,229
when someone passes away."

410
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:36,964
[Moreh] Rachel Feinstein,

411
00:26:36,997 --> 00:26:39,400
please help your
friend Rachel Grossman.

412
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:41,635
Excuse yourselves if you must.

413
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:43,704
- [Elaina] Should I keep going?
- [Moreh] Um...

414
00:26:43,737 --> 00:26:45,973
Would anyone else care to read?

415
00:26:46,006 --> 00:26:49,243
Let's have a little
fun, shall we?

416
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:53,280
Um, Yitzhaka, please, continue.

417
00:26:55,816 --> 00:26:57,318
"There are many
Jewish traditions

418
00:26:57,351 --> 00:26:59,186
associated with death.

419
00:27:00,955 --> 00:27:02,756
Some come right from the Torah,

420
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,692
while others were
developed in Eastern Europe

421
00:27:04,725 --> 00:27:06,927
throughout the 19th century,"

422
00:27:06,961 --> 00:27:08,429
[Moreh] Yes, Hila.

423
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:11,031
Moreh Klein, what do you
think the great rabbis

424
00:27:11,065 --> 00:27:14,802
would specifically say
about this situation?

425
00:27:14,835 --> 00:27:17,671
Interesting question, Hila.

426
00:27:17,705 --> 00:27:20,374
I think the great rabbis tell us

427
00:27:20,407 --> 00:27:21,942
that in order to
understand death,

428
00:27:21,976 --> 00:27:24,912
we must have insightful
conversations.

429
00:27:24,945 --> 00:27:29,683
We can't express grief with
standard, shallow platitudes.

430
00:27:29,717 --> 00:27:31,152
Like what we're
doing here today.

431
00:27:31,185 --> 00:27:33,854
- For Samantha.
- Exactly, Miera.

432
00:27:34,955 --> 00:27:35,856
(Hannah snorts)

433
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:36,790
What was that?

434
00:27:36,824 --> 00:27:38,392
A cough.

435
00:27:38,425 --> 00:27:41,962
[Moreh] Did you have
something to add, Yitzhaka?

436
00:27:41,996 --> 00:27:45,032
[Hannah] Um, uh, yeah.

437
00:27:46,133 --> 00:27:47,368
I was wondering

438
00:27:47,401 --> 00:27:49,336
if I should keep reading.

439
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:52,006
I see.

440
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:54,708
Would anyone else cared to read?

441
00:27:54,742 --> 00:27:58,012
- Yes, Miera.
- Miera?

442
00:27:58,045 --> 00:28:00,447
"Some of these traditions
include preparing the body

443
00:28:00,481 --> 00:28:03,784
by cleansing it and the ritual
act of purification Tahara,

444
00:28:03,817 --> 00:28:06,053
in which the funeral
director or, alternatively,

445
00:28:06,086 --> 00:28:09,823
a holy society, the <i>chevra
kadisha</i> cleanses the body."

446
00:28:09,857 --> 00:28:11,768
In Samantha's case, her body
would have only been handled

447
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:14,461
by women to make sure
it stayed totally pure.

448
00:28:14,495 --> 00:28:16,964
I bet Samantha
would've liked that.

449
00:28:16,997 --> 00:28:19,967
(Rachel sobbing)

450
00:28:22,836 --> 00:28:25,472
[Moreh] Now, can anyone
tell me the significance

451
00:28:25,507 --> 00:28:27,141
of these rituals?

452
00:28:30,277 --> 00:28:33,147
Come on, I don't want Miera
and Hila to do all the talking.

453
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,149
One of you young
scholars must understand

454
00:28:35,182 --> 00:28:38,219
why it's important that the
body be pure before burial?

455
00:28:42,122 --> 00:28:44,024
Fine, Miera.

456
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:48,262
It's supposed to erase your
social status in death.

457
00:28:48,295 --> 00:28:50,831
Correct. The only relationship
that matters in the end

458
00:28:50,864 --> 00:28:55,035
is the one you have
with Hashem. Yes, Hila?

459
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:56,937
Um, yeah, just
piggybacking off of that,

460
00:28:56,971 --> 00:28:58,872
I wanted to say
how important it is

461
00:28:58,906 --> 00:29:01,108
because it shows no
matter how bad things are,

462
00:29:01,141 --> 00:29:02,276
like, if you're dead,

463
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:04,011
we always have our faith.

464
00:29:04,044 --> 00:29:07,781
But we have it when
we're alive too.

465
00:29:07,815 --> 00:29:10,552
[Moreh] Does anyone else want
to add to this discussion?

466
00:29:10,585 --> 00:29:12,253
Stop.

467
00:29:18,092 --> 00:29:19,059
Oh, my God, Hannah!

468
00:29:19,093 --> 00:29:20,394
[Moreh] Yitzhaka?

469
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:21,996
Are you all right?

470
00:29:23,364 --> 00:29:26,133
Um... yeah, I just,

471
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:28,202
I didn't have that
much for breakfast.

472
00:29:28,235 --> 00:29:29,870
It was my fault, sorry.

473
00:29:29,903 --> 00:29:32,406
[Moreh] Uh, maybe
it's time for a break.

474
00:29:34,975 --> 00:29:37,978
Yitzhaka, please make
sure you drink some water

475
00:29:38,012 --> 00:29:39,446
and get something to eat.

476
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,383
We don't need to add to
today's tragedy, understood?

477
00:29:42,416 --> 00:29:43,518
I'll take care of her.

478
00:29:43,551 --> 00:29:45,252
Thank you, Hava.

479
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,821
Hey, are you okay?

480
00:29:47,855 --> 00:29:49,223
Totally, I just,
I lost my balance.

481
00:29:49,256 --> 00:29:50,558
That's all.

482
00:29:54,895 --> 00:29:58,065
God, I can't believe I did
that, that's so embarrassing.

483
00:30:06,974 --> 00:30:09,910
(waves crashing)

484
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,549
[Natalie] I don't know, man.

485
00:30:14,582 --> 00:30:16,250
That could totally
be Photoshopped.

486
00:30:16,283 --> 00:30:19,119
No way somebody made
that on Photoshop.

487
00:30:19,153 --> 00:30:21,922
What about the whole, like,
you know, satellite thing?

488
00:30:21,955 --> 00:30:24,258
Well, I mean, according to
the video, this satellite...

489
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:25,926
- Shut up!
- You shut up.

490
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:27,529
Why do we never see
the boats go lower?

491
00:30:27,562 --> 00:30:30,364
I wonder if prom's even
still gonna happen?

492
00:30:30,397 --> 00:30:33,434
Of course it is. They wouldn't
cancel prom over one person.

493
00:30:33,467 --> 00:30:36,003
If anything, they should move
it up so we have a distraction.

494
00:30:36,036 --> 00:30:37,539
Or, like, make it a memorial.

495
00:30:37,572 --> 00:30:40,341
- That's a really good idea.
- Thanks.

496
00:30:40,374 --> 00:30:42,409
I just said prom should
be a distraction.

497
00:30:42,443 --> 00:30:43,578
Oh, right.

498
00:30:45,913 --> 00:30:47,582
I just can't believe
she won't be there.

499
00:30:47,615 --> 00:30:49,216
Me too.

500
00:30:49,249 --> 00:30:51,251
Were you guys close?

501
00:30:52,453 --> 00:30:54,154
That's too bad.

502
00:31:05,232 --> 00:31:06,634
Hey. (laughs)

503
00:31:06,668 --> 00:31:09,269
I can't watch this
fake pity party.

504
00:31:09,303 --> 00:31:11,506
Yeah, yeah, me neither.

505
00:31:12,473 --> 00:31:14,007
You wanna...

506
00:31:15,242 --> 00:31:17,211
- What?
- You know...

507
00:31:18,178 --> 00:31:19,980
could go to the bathroom and...

508
00:31:20,013 --> 00:31:22,550
I mean, people are probably
gonna be crying in there

509
00:31:22,584 --> 00:31:24,918
or worse, talking about me.

510
00:31:24,952 --> 00:31:27,154
Yeah, probably.

511
00:31:27,187 --> 00:31:28,623
Um...

512
00:31:28,656 --> 00:31:31,091
but we can check and
see if it's empty,

513
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:34,128
- and if it's empty, we can...
- What are you talking about?

514
00:31:34,161 --> 00:31:36,130
If you have to go
to the bathroom, go.

515
00:31:37,097 --> 00:31:38,399
Uh, yeah, yeah.

516
00:31:38,432 --> 00:31:40,934
I don't have to go
to the bathroom.

517
00:31:40,968 --> 00:31:43,137
Okay, then what?

518
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,339
Nothing, nothing.

519
00:31:45,372 --> 00:31:46,907
Never mind.

520
00:31:48,643 --> 00:31:51,145
- Have you seen Tristan?
- No.

521
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:53,447
I wonder if he went outside.

522
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,550
That'd be so like
him. (laughing)

523
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:57,351
It's like 20 degrees out.

524
00:31:57,384 --> 00:31:59,420
I know, he's so random.

525
00:31:59,453 --> 00:32:02,156
I wonder if I should say
something to him so he, like,

526
00:32:02,189 --> 00:32:04,526
- knows that I'm here.
- I'm sure he knows you're here.

527
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:08,195
I don't know. I feel like I
haven't been very, like, visible.

528
00:32:08,228 --> 00:32:10,197
You fell out of your chair,
like, two seconds ago.

529
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,734
Yeah, that's not the kind
of visibility that I want.

530
00:32:12,767 --> 00:32:14,968
Plus, I don't think he noticed.

531
00:32:15,002 --> 00:32:17,572
He definitely saw.

532
00:32:17,605 --> 00:32:19,416
I thought you were gonna
get, like, a concussion.

533
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,276
Ugh, yeah.

534
00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:24,211
So embarrassing.

535
00:32:25,078 --> 00:32:26,213
Whatever.

536
00:32:26,246 --> 00:32:27,381
I just want him to see me

537
00:32:27,414 --> 00:32:29,483
how I want him to.

538
00:32:29,517 --> 00:32:32,352
- You know how it is.
- Not really.

539
00:32:32,386 --> 00:32:35,055
Like, I want him to
see me doing hot stuff.

540
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:36,323
Like what?

541
00:32:38,025 --> 00:32:40,662
Do you know where we
could get a Popsicle?

542
00:32:40,695 --> 00:32:41,696
(uncomfortable chuckle)

543
00:32:41,729 --> 00:32:43,297
Kidding. (laughs)

544
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:45,265
We'll find something else.

545
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:50,170
Or, like,

546
00:32:50,204 --> 00:32:53,474
maybe we could practice more.

547
00:32:55,777 --> 00:32:57,144
You know, you said
you wanted to be

548
00:32:57,177 --> 00:32:59,213
like a really great kisser.

549
00:32:59,246 --> 00:33:01,783
Yeah, and now I know that I am.

550
00:33:01,816 --> 00:33:03,317
I want him to, like, want me.

551
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,352
Like, how do I get
somebody to want me?

552
00:33:05,385 --> 00:33:07,689
I don't know. I'm sure
you'll figure it out.

553
00:33:07,722 --> 00:33:11,225
Is it, like, my hair? I was
gonna straighten it this morning,

554
00:33:11,258 --> 00:33:15,262
but I didn't have enough time and now
it's gonna mess everything up for me.

555
00:33:15,295 --> 00:33:17,397
Where are you going?

556
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:20,100
God.

557
00:33:20,535 --> 00:33:22,604
(crying)

558
00:33:28,643 --> 00:33:30,477
(door opens)

559
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,315
- (door closes)
- Hi.

560
00:33:36,383 --> 00:33:37,652
[Elaina] Hey.

561
00:33:49,597 --> 00:33:51,131
Do you vape?

562
00:33:58,338 --> 00:34:02,610
I, uh, don't think we're
allowed to smoke in here.

563
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:06,548
It's not smoke.

564
00:34:06,581 --> 00:34:08,850
It's cucumber, it's
easily the best flavor,

565
00:34:08,883 --> 00:34:10,284
but they don't make it any more

566
00:34:10,317 --> 00:34:12,252
so my brother has
to buy it on eBay.

567
00:34:20,895 --> 00:34:23,497
(coughing)

568
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:28,302
Mango's good too though.

569
00:34:38,412 --> 00:34:40,247
I don't want to sit in here.

570
00:34:44,852 --> 00:34:46,754
What are you so scared of?

571
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:50,490
Nothing.

572
00:34:51,191 --> 00:34:52,627
Damn.

573
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,796
I'm bored.

574
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:58,131
Why don't you break me off a
little piece of that brownie?

575
00:35:06,608 --> 00:35:09,877
Dude, you were only supposed
to have, like, a tiny bite.

576
00:35:09,911 --> 00:35:11,445
[Zack] Your brother
got ripped off.

577
00:35:11,478 --> 00:35:12,547
If these haven't hit yet,

578
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,716
they're not going to.

579
00:35:14,749 --> 00:35:16,684
Oh, hey.

580
00:35:16,718 --> 00:35:18,285
Sorry about your
dead girlfriend.

581
00:35:18,318 --> 00:35:19,787
Dude, stop it, seriously?

582
00:35:19,821 --> 00:35:21,455
- What? I was joking.
- It's not funny.

583
00:35:21,488 --> 00:35:22,890
No, it's fine. I mean,

584
00:35:22,924 --> 00:35:25,392
she wasn't actually
my girlfriend so...

585
00:35:25,425 --> 00:35:26,761
I mean, not anymore.

586
00:35:26,794 --> 00:35:28,328
Oh, I'm really sorry dude.

587
00:35:28,362 --> 00:35:30,430
No, we didn't actually
know each other.

588
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:32,399
Yeah, totally. Do you want
to see something cool?

589
00:35:32,432 --> 00:35:34,636
Dude, stop. It's fake.

590
00:35:35,903 --> 00:35:39,439
(students chattering)

591
00:35:47,915 --> 00:35:50,217
Let's get back to it.

592
00:36:00,728 --> 00:36:03,296
Hey, Trist...

593
00:36:15,308 --> 00:36:16,944
[Moreh] All right, everyone.

594
00:36:16,978 --> 00:36:19,580
Please turn over your
worksheets from earlier.

595
00:36:19,614 --> 00:36:22,550
As you can see, it's
divided into six panels,

596
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:24,986
each representing a
stage of mourning.

597
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:26,988
I want you to fill
in each section

598
00:36:27,021 --> 00:36:31,258
with how you, personally,
will honor Samantha's memory.

599
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:32,827
(coughing)

600
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,662
Oh, my God, don't
inhale so deeply.

601
00:36:34,696 --> 00:36:37,364
One puff of these is
like 20 cigarettes.

602
00:36:37,397 --> 00:36:39,442
If you keep coughing like that,
you're basically done for.

603
00:36:39,466 --> 00:36:40,702
Thank you.

604
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:46,808
(coughing)

605
00:36:49,877 --> 00:36:54,582
So when did you first
start smoking, or vaping?

606
00:36:54,615 --> 00:36:55,717
This summer.

607
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,553
I wanted to impress a boy.

608
00:36:58,586 --> 00:37:01,723
Well, it's, like,
super impressive.

609
00:37:03,024 --> 00:37:04,424
Do you, um,

610
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:05,869
do you remember
Samantha's bat mitzvah?

611
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:08,428
Uh, I don't think I went.

612
00:37:09,063 --> 00:37:10,665
Yeah, it was the, um,

613
00:37:10,698 --> 00:37:13,000
it was the same
day as Amy Levi's

614
00:37:13,034 --> 00:37:15,368
and most people didn't
want to go to both, or...

615
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:17,839
honestly, most people only
wanted to go to Amy's.

616
00:37:17,872 --> 00:37:19,807
Yeah, Amy's was at
the planetarium.

617
00:37:19,841 --> 00:37:21,341
Yeah, it was cool.

618
00:37:21,374 --> 00:37:23,477
And Samantha's was at
that, like, weird hotel,

619
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:25,646
The, um, Wagon Wheel.

620
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,481
You know, it was,
like, horse-themed.

621
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:31,418
Did you go to Samantha's?

622
00:37:31,451 --> 00:37:33,286
Yeah, I went. My
mom made me go.

623
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,865
She said I had to go
to anyone's bat mitzvah

624
00:37:34,889 --> 00:37:36,891
who was in my
Hebrew school class.

625
00:37:36,924 --> 00:37:39,459
Even if we weren't friends.

626
00:37:39,493 --> 00:37:41,304
Plus, me and Samantha used to
carpool together all the time.

627
00:37:41,328 --> 00:37:43,330
She lives, like, three
houses down from me.

628
00:37:46,634 --> 00:37:47,969
Lived.

629
00:37:50,538 --> 00:37:52,540
I'm really sorry.

630
00:37:52,573 --> 00:37:54,407
Yeah.

631
00:37:54,441 --> 00:37:56,409
It was, like, so sad.

632
00:37:56,443 --> 00:38:00,815
It was, like, all adults and
Samantha's little cousins

633
00:38:00,848 --> 00:38:02,984
and, like, the DJ kept
trying to get people to dance

634
00:38:03,017 --> 00:38:06,554
and, like, no one did.

635
00:38:06,587 --> 00:38:10,357
I mean, I left right
after the candle ceremony,

636
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:13,493
which was humiliating.

637
00:38:15,596 --> 00:38:17,632
But she had a candle
for all of her friends

638
00:38:17,665 --> 00:38:20,902
and it was just me and
our other neighbor, Kim.

639
00:38:22,435 --> 00:38:24,605
Oh, my God, that sucks.

640
00:38:25,873 --> 00:38:27,374
Yeah.

641
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,344
(sighs) I wish...

642
00:38:32,613 --> 00:38:34,849
I mean, I don't know.

643
00:38:34,882 --> 00:38:37,350
I know she was weird, but, like,

644
00:38:37,384 --> 00:38:39,486
I wish people cared
about her more.

645
00:38:41,756 --> 00:38:43,758
Today feels so fake.

646
00:38:44,525 --> 00:38:46,694
Yeah.

647
00:38:46,727 --> 00:38:48,963
(clears throat) But you
two were close, right?

648
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,065
Uh...

649
00:38:52,066 --> 00:38:54,702
I mean, not really, um...

650
00:38:57,437 --> 00:38:59,874
In elementary school, we used
to, like, dance together,

651
00:38:59,907 --> 00:39:02,510
but, you know, like, you know,

652
00:39:02,543 --> 00:39:05,613
hip hop and jazz and whatever.

653
00:39:05,646 --> 00:39:07,380
It was so dumb.

654
00:39:07,414 --> 00:39:10,751
I quit when I went to
middle school, um...

655
00:39:10,785 --> 00:39:14,522
So, I never really saw
her outside of any of that

656
00:39:14,555 --> 00:39:15,957
except for here.

657
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:18,125
But...

658
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,761
I don't know.

659
00:39:20,795 --> 00:39:23,097
This feels, like, different.

660
00:39:25,465 --> 00:39:29,436
So, we weren't
really, like, friends,

661
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:32,640
I don't know why.

662
00:39:36,043 --> 00:39:38,045
I guess... I guess
I do know why.

663
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,083
I just never really gave
her much of a chance.

664
00:39:44,752 --> 00:39:48,522
And now, I guess I never will.

665
00:39:48,556 --> 00:39:51,424
Yeah, she, like, never told
anyone anything about herself.

666
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:53,561
Like, it was clear she
was a total lesbian.

667
00:39:53,594 --> 00:39:55,005
Like just come out already.
We all see your haircut,

668
00:39:55,029 --> 00:39:56,964
- no one cares.
- Yeah.

669
00:39:58,866 --> 00:40:02,136
Well, except for Hannah, but, like,
she didn't feel the same way so...

670
00:40:04,705 --> 00:40:06,807
Wait, wait, what?

671
00:40:06,841 --> 00:40:08,619
I mean, I wouldn't want
Samantha to ask me out,

672
00:40:08,643 --> 00:40:11,411
but I wouldn't go and
tell literally everyone.

673
00:40:13,814 --> 00:40:16,217
(fluttering)

674
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,028
[Hannah] Ew, why are you
looking at me like that?

675
00:40:18,052 --> 00:40:21,589
What? Are you, like,
in love with me now?

676
00:40:21,622 --> 00:40:23,724
(laughing)

677
00:40:23,758 --> 00:40:25,793
Wait until I tell
literally everyone.

678
00:40:25,826 --> 00:40:27,137
And you know what
else is annoying?

679
00:40:27,161 --> 00:40:28,796
Why is Melissa being
so needy today?

680
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:30,932
Like, why are you making
today all about you?

681
00:40:30,965 --> 00:40:32,876
You know, Samantha was,
like, actually my friend,

682
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,845
and I get that you have things
going on with your parents,

683
00:40:34,869 --> 00:40:38,072
but, like, Samantha's dead.

684
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,075
Yeah.

685
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:43,210
Totally, I get it.

686
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,215
Okay, well, I guess the
break's almost over.

687
00:40:48,249 --> 00:40:51,152
This was... weird, but fun.

688
00:40:51,185 --> 00:40:53,688
- I guess.
- Yeah.

689
00:41:01,195 --> 00:41:04,565
[Moreh] Remember that
each and every one of you

690
00:41:04,598 --> 00:41:08,970
should always be
here for one another.

691
00:41:09,003 --> 00:41:11,172
As the Babylonian
Talmud tells us,

692
00:41:11,205 --> 00:41:15,543
all Jews are responsible
for one another.

693
00:41:15,576 --> 00:41:18,980
Tragedy takes a long
time to process.

694
00:41:19,013 --> 00:41:20,715
Super embarrassing.

695
00:41:20,748 --> 00:41:23,517
[Moreh] Thankfully, your
faith will guide you through

696
00:41:23,551 --> 00:41:25,519
and so will your community.

697
00:41:25,553 --> 00:41:27,989
(Carrie and Elaina laughing)

698
00:41:28,856 --> 00:41:29,957
(coughing)

699
00:41:29,991 --> 00:41:31,759
Did you feel this?

700
00:41:38,733 --> 00:41:41,501
- Uh, definitely.
- Okay.

701
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:46,173
And so, once
everyone is finished,

702
00:41:46,207 --> 00:41:48,909
we will share our
responses out loud

703
00:41:48,943 --> 00:41:52,813
and see how we can best
process our grief together.

704
00:42:00,621 --> 00:42:03,958
(students chattering)

705
00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:07,828
- Oh, hi.
- What's up?

706
00:42:07,862 --> 00:42:09,897
(Carrie laughing)

707
00:42:17,338 --> 00:42:19,807
(chatter and laughter continue)

708
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:35,956
How did you think of that quick?

709
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,358
Oh, my God. Don't
even look at me.

710
00:42:37,391 --> 00:42:38,926
Don't look.

711
00:42:44,131 --> 00:42:46,834
- Uh, Moreh Klein?
- Yes, Yitzhaka?

712
00:42:46,867 --> 00:42:48,069
Could I use the restroom?

713
00:42:48,102 --> 00:42:50,171
[Moreh] We just got
back from break.

714
00:42:50,204 --> 00:42:52,940
I know, I just thought I
felt a little bit of blood

715
00:42:52,973 --> 00:42:55,943
on the seat, so I thought
maybe I could ask you

716
00:42:55,976 --> 00:42:58,112
if I could go, if
not, it's okay.

717
00:42:58,145 --> 00:42:59,713
- Go.
- Okay.

718
00:43:54,268 --> 00:43:55,836
Whatever.

719
00:44:06,113 --> 00:44:07,348
[Moreh] Toda, Rifkah.

720
00:44:07,381 --> 00:44:09,350
Now, who else would
like to share?

721
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,088
Anyone can share.

722
00:44:14,121 --> 00:44:17,958
There are no wrong
answers. Uh-huh.

723
00:44:17,992 --> 00:44:19,994
I just think this whole
thing is really sad

724
00:44:20,027 --> 00:44:23,130
and it's such a hard
time for all of us.

725
00:44:23,164 --> 00:44:25,065
Also, I was wondering
who drew this?

726
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:27,768
I'm looking to
commission some artwork.

727
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:29,770
Dude, you do not
need anymore art.

728
00:44:29,803 --> 00:44:31,005
You have so much.

729
00:44:31,038 --> 00:44:33,240
Thank you for sharing, Yihtzak.

730
00:44:33,274 --> 00:44:35,910
I don't know who drew it.

731
00:44:35,943 --> 00:44:37,821
- [Natalie] Obviously.
- [Zack] It was worth asking.

732
00:44:37,845 --> 00:44:41,248
Now, would anyone
else like to share?

733
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:25,759
[Miera] And I just feel,
like, I really relate to this

734
00:45:25,793 --> 00:45:28,530
because just the shock
and the numbness,

735
00:45:28,563 --> 00:45:32,166
- that's phase one, like I was at camp, and so...
- You okay?

736
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:34,235
I was really shocked
when I got that call.

737
00:45:34,268 --> 00:45:37,304
And then, like, there's the
sadness part, which I did...

738
00:45:37,338 --> 00:45:41,041
Literally, every atom in my
body is vibrating right now.

739
00:45:41,075 --> 00:45:42,843
I think still stuck in
that busy-ness phase,

740
00:45:42,876 --> 00:45:45,946
because it really just
helps me to cope with grief.

741
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:49,383
Just keeping busy and, like,
keeping my mind doing other things.

742
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:51,519
And I just think that
it would be really nice

743
00:45:51,553 --> 00:45:53,787
in a year from now to come
back and do something similar

744
00:45:53,821 --> 00:45:55,155
to what we're doing today.

745
00:45:55,189 --> 00:45:57,891
I always light the
Yehuda for my Bubbe.

746
00:45:57,925 --> 00:45:59,570
She passed away three years
ago, but I'm still really sad

747
00:45:59,594 --> 00:46:02,363
- about that.
- Mmm. Thank you, Miera.

748
00:46:04,164 --> 00:46:05,866
What?

749
00:46:05,899 --> 00:46:08,202
What? Sorry.

750
00:46:08,235 --> 00:46:11,171
[Moreh] Hila, would
you like to share?

751
00:46:11,205 --> 00:46:14,174
I just thought what Miera
said is powerful is all.

752
00:46:15,543 --> 00:46:16,810
Toda.

753
00:46:17,878 --> 00:46:19,480
Is that seat open?

754
00:46:39,867 --> 00:46:43,971
Hava, do you have
something to share?

755
00:46:44,004 --> 00:46:46,574
- No, I'm good. Thank you.
- This is a safe space

756
00:46:46,608 --> 00:46:50,044
and you haven't said anything
all day, please, share.

757
00:46:51,912 --> 00:46:53,447
[Carrie] Mmm.

758
00:46:57,017 --> 00:46:58,385
Um...

759
00:47:00,454 --> 00:47:02,489
Okay, um...

760
00:47:02,524 --> 00:47:05,993
I guess I've just
been thinking and...

761
00:47:07,161 --> 00:47:10,497
I realized that none
of this matters.

762
00:47:10,532 --> 00:47:12,232
What doesn't matter?

763
00:47:12,266 --> 00:47:15,069
Um, today and everything,

764
00:47:15,102 --> 00:47:17,572
like... like, this class thing.

765
00:47:19,473 --> 00:47:22,644
I mean, none of us really liked
Samantha that much, right?

766
00:47:22,677 --> 00:47:24,111
Right?

767
00:47:24,144 --> 00:47:26,280
Right, Elaina?

768
00:47:28,248 --> 00:47:29,917
I don't know what
you're talking about.

769
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:34,154
You said that none of
this really matters

770
00:47:34,188 --> 00:47:36,290
and it's all fake and
no one really cares

771
00:47:36,323 --> 00:47:38,526
- that Samantha's dead.
- Hila, do you feel that way?

772
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:42,296
Absolutely not. I
never said that.

773
00:47:42,329 --> 00:47:44,998
You literally told
me, like, an hour ago.

774
00:47:45,032 --> 00:47:48,235
Today is a horrible day and
I don't know why you're lying

775
00:47:48,268 --> 00:47:50,437
- and making it worse for everyone.
- I'm not lying.

776
00:47:50,471 --> 00:47:53,407
Maybe we should take
a moment to reflect.

777
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,477
I mean, were any of us surprised
to find out that it was Samantha?

778
00:47:58,078 --> 00:48:01,148
Like, none of us did
anything to help her

779
00:48:01,181 --> 00:48:02,693
'cause we're all too
caught up in our own lives.

780
00:48:02,717 --> 00:48:05,018
(girls sobbing)

781
00:48:05,052 --> 00:48:06,987
God, shut up.

782
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:09,123
Hava, please.

783
00:48:09,156 --> 00:48:11,291
But you asked me to be honest.

784
00:48:11,325 --> 00:48:14,461
And I'm just tired
of acting like this

785
00:48:14,495 --> 00:48:16,196
has some sort of greater meaning

786
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:19,233
and we, like, cared so much.

787
00:48:19,266 --> 00:48:21,135
I mean, Samantha killed herself

788
00:48:21,168 --> 00:48:23,437
and nothing that we do here
today is gonna change that.

789
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:25,406
I know we're all exhausted,

790
00:48:25,439 --> 00:48:27,675
but I think we can have
a productive discussion

791
00:48:27,709 --> 00:48:30,411
about how you feel.

792
00:48:30,444 --> 00:48:34,481
Well, I'm sorry being honest
isn't fucking productive.

793
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:38,385
Do you have a
worksheet for that?

794
00:48:41,422 --> 00:48:46,393
If you cannot be here today,
you are free to leave.

795
00:48:46,427 --> 00:48:49,129
My ride doesn't get
here until five.

796
00:48:49,163 --> 00:48:50,732
Then maybe you should
go into the hall

797
00:48:50,765 --> 00:48:54,168
and call and see if they
can come get you earlier.

798
00:48:58,071 --> 00:48:59,507
Fine.

799
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:21,563
Yes, Tzadik.

800
00:49:21,596 --> 00:49:24,064
- I gotta use the bathroom.
- Go.

801
00:49:33,207 --> 00:49:35,543
(rumbling)

802
00:49:44,251 --> 00:49:46,353
(rumbling stops abruptly)

803
00:49:46,386 --> 00:49:50,123
Now, who else would
like to share?

804
00:50:00,835 --> 00:50:03,036
(cars passing by)

805
00:50:35,537 --> 00:50:37,437
Shabbat Shalom.

806
00:50:41,441 --> 00:50:44,211
How's everybody doing tonight?

807
00:50:54,722 --> 00:50:56,156
(Tristan coughs)

808
00:50:56,189 --> 00:50:57,391
Oh, um...

809
00:50:57,424 --> 00:50:59,259
[Tristan] Oh, sorry.

810
00:50:59,293 --> 00:51:02,195
Oh, no, no. It's
fine, I'm fine.

811
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:04,832
Welcome to the sanctuary.

812
00:51:09,403 --> 00:51:12,406
So, today's been
crazy boring, right?

813
00:51:12,439 --> 00:51:15,242
- What do you mean?
- And, like, really sad too.

814
00:51:15,275 --> 00:51:16,744
Yeah.

815
00:51:19,781 --> 00:51:21,783
I mean, especially for you.

816
00:51:21,816 --> 00:51:24,217
Cause, like, you know?

817
00:51:27,487 --> 00:51:30,525
I mean, didn't you and
Samantha used to...

818
00:51:30,558 --> 00:51:33,561
Oh, uh, that was fake.

819
00:51:34,294 --> 00:51:35,495
Um...

820
00:51:37,532 --> 00:51:42,202
Topher made that up as a
joke and... 'Cause she's...

821
00:51:42,235 --> 00:51:45,272
She was the... the weird girl who
never talked to any of the boys

822
00:51:45,305 --> 00:51:50,645
and she was really into
yarn and it was messed up.

823
00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:52,680
(sighs)

824
00:51:52,714 --> 00:51:54,481
Now it's even more messed up.

825
00:51:56,751 --> 00:52:00,722
That... that sucks, I'm sorry.

826
00:52:00,755 --> 00:52:03,223
[scoffs] Yeah.

827
00:52:03,256 --> 00:52:05,660
And, like, I feel like
everyone's looking at me,

828
00:52:05,693 --> 00:52:09,296
like I'm, like, super upset
about her dying or whatever.

829
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:11,566
And that's not even
true because I...

830
00:52:12,834 --> 00:52:15,870
That's... that's not what I...

831
00:52:15,903 --> 00:52:17,572
(sighs)

832
00:52:17,605 --> 00:52:20,240
I mean, it's shit
that she's dead

833
00:52:20,273 --> 00:52:22,877
and I guess I should
have told them

834
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:26,313
to stop saying all that stuff.

835
00:52:27,749 --> 00:52:29,483
And now this...

836
00:52:30,618 --> 00:52:31,853
thing.

837
00:52:31,886 --> 00:52:35,188
- So you two weren't close?
- What?

838
00:52:35,222 --> 00:52:36,824
You and Samantha.
You weren't close,

839
00:52:36,858 --> 00:52:38,926
- 'cause you didn't ever?
- No, no.

840
00:52:39,994 --> 00:52:41,696
Yeah, same.

841
00:52:41,729 --> 00:52:47,602
Wait, didn't she, like, ask
you out a few weeks ago?

842
00:52:47,635 --> 00:52:50,638
I think she thought
you were, like...

843
00:52:50,672 --> 00:52:53,608
- Like, a lesbian...
- Oh, my God, no.

844
00:52:53,641 --> 00:52:55,710
That's crazy that
you heard that.

845
00:52:55,743 --> 00:52:58,378
Well, you posted it
on your... Right?

846
00:52:58,412 --> 00:53:00,758
I mean, I could have sworn I saw
on your story that you were...

847
00:53:00,782 --> 00:53:04,484
I mean, like, who can remember?
That was all so long ago.

848
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:10,390
I mean, I don't think
she even meant it.

849
00:53:11,726 --> 00:53:14,294
Yeah.

850
00:53:14,327 --> 00:53:15,930
Well, I wouldn't be surprised.

851
00:53:15,963 --> 00:53:18,733
She never came "out" out, but,

852
00:53:18,766 --> 00:53:21,268
well, she never
had to, you know?

853
00:53:23,004 --> 00:53:24,806
Yeah.

854
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:27,240
Well, I guess I just
wasn't that into it.

855
00:53:27,274 --> 00:53:30,011
- [scoffs] Sorry.
- Because of the horses?

856
00:53:30,044 --> 00:53:32,513
No.

857
00:53:32,547 --> 00:53:34,549
Actually, yeah. (laughing)

858
00:53:35,348 --> 00:53:36,718
No, I just...

859
00:53:37,852 --> 00:53:40,688
I don't know why,

860
00:53:40,722 --> 00:53:44,659
but at the time, it
really weirded me out.

861
00:53:44,692 --> 00:53:48,730
It was like... like...

862
00:53:48,763 --> 00:53:50,932
Like maybe she just
really liked you?

863
00:53:55,636 --> 00:53:58,740
Sorry, just being honest.

864
00:53:58,773 --> 00:54:01,609
Well, it's not like I
would never do that.

865
00:54:03,376 --> 00:54:04,645
Yeah, um...

866
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:07,481
have you, uh, seen
Carrie around or...?

867
00:54:07,515 --> 00:54:09,784
Wasn't she just in class?

868
00:54:09,817 --> 00:54:11,384
Oh, my God, she left.

869
00:54:11,418 --> 00:54:13,386
Wait, why? Is she all right?

870
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,056
I think so. Oh, my...

871
00:54:15,089 --> 00:54:18,391
- She went off on Moreh Klein.
- What did she say?

872
00:54:18,425 --> 00:54:23,631
Like, just that, like,
today's totally fake.

873
00:54:24,799 --> 00:54:26,500
Like, which it is. (laughing)

874
00:54:26,534 --> 00:54:27,574
I think she's really cool.

875
00:54:27,602 --> 00:54:28,903
I think today's fake too.

876
00:54:28,936 --> 00:54:31,506
Yeah, like, super fake.

877
00:54:31,539 --> 00:54:33,775
It's, like, what are
we even doing here?

878
00:54:33,808 --> 00:54:36,343
Plus, it's, like, today
and then that's it.

879
00:54:36,376 --> 00:54:38,846
We're all gonna just
move on with our lives.

880
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,414
Forget about this
tomorrow. (laughs)

881
00:54:44,652 --> 00:54:47,287
Sorry, that was, like, a lot.

882
00:54:51,893 --> 00:54:56,097
So, uh, you and Carrie are...

883
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:57,732
You guys are like
best friends, right?

884
00:54:57,765 --> 00:55:00,467
Yeah, she's my best friend.

885
00:55:03,571 --> 00:55:07,508
So, is she, like,
hooking up with anyone

886
00:55:07,542 --> 00:55:10,745
right now or...?

887
00:55:10,778 --> 00:55:13,581
Um, it's not... I... It's
not, like, that big of a...

888
00:55:13,614 --> 00:55:15,692
It's not a big, uh... It's not
that big of a deal or anything.

889
00:55:15,716 --> 00:55:16,994
I just wanted to
know if she, uh...

890
00:55:17,018 --> 00:55:18,820
We've made out before.

891
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:20,922
Yeah.

892
00:55:20,955 --> 00:55:24,491
We, like, make out and stuff.

893
00:55:24,525 --> 00:55:25,993
It's not like a thing, you know?

894
00:55:26,027 --> 00:55:27,628
It's whatever.

895
00:55:28,963 --> 00:55:30,932
[scoffs] Oh, okay.

896
00:55:31,799 --> 00:55:34,068
She's a good kisser.

897
00:55:34,101 --> 00:55:35,603
So am I.

898
00:55:35,636 --> 00:55:38,039
Oh, uh, cool.

899
00:55:38,072 --> 00:55:39,874
I, I guess?

900
00:55:39,907 --> 00:55:43,611
We kiss boys too, if
you're interested.

901
00:55:44,745 --> 00:55:47,447
Oh, um... I don't, I don't...

902
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:51,384
I mean, like, if you wanted a
distraction from today, you know?

903
00:55:51,418 --> 00:55:53,921
I was already gonna hang out
with Carrie in the library.

904
00:55:53,955 --> 00:55:55,590
You should join.

905
00:55:59,492 --> 00:56:00,828
Now?

906
00:56:00,862 --> 00:56:02,663
Meet me in the
library in, like, 10.

907
00:56:05,432 --> 00:56:08,769
Um, yeah, okay.
Um, are you sure?

908
00:56:08,803 --> 00:56:13,708
Hannah, are you sure this is
like the right time to be...?

909
00:56:14,942 --> 00:56:17,678
Ah. (laughs)

910
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:27,088
Hannah, are you in here?

911
00:57:05,726 --> 00:57:07,460
Hannah?

912
00:57:18,205 --> 00:57:20,641
(children playing outside)

913
00:57:35,156 --> 00:57:37,224
- Hey.
- I was just calling you.

914
00:57:37,258 --> 00:57:39,226
Yeah, my phone's off.
Where have you been?

915
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:41,028
I had to get some air.

916
00:57:41,062 --> 00:57:42,973
Plus, it looks like I'm
not the only who skipped.

917
00:57:42,997 --> 00:57:45,533
- I was looking for you.
- That's not what I heard.

918
00:57:45,566 --> 00:57:46,734
Why are you being so weird?

919
00:57:46,767 --> 00:57:47,835
I'm not being weird.

920
00:57:47,868 --> 00:57:49,502
What?

921
00:57:49,537 --> 00:57:51,505
You're, like, um,

922
00:57:51,539 --> 00:57:52,907
like gaslighting me.

923
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:54,742
(laughing) No, I'm not.

924
00:57:54,775 --> 00:57:56,110
That's not what that word means.

925
00:57:56,143 --> 00:57:57,578
Yes, it is and you are.

926
00:57:57,611 --> 00:57:58,789
You're telling me
that I'm being weird

927
00:57:58,813 --> 00:57:59,780
but I'm not doing anything.

928
00:57:59,814 --> 00:58:01,115
You're being weird.

929
00:58:01,148 --> 00:58:02,183
No, I'm not.

930
00:58:02,216 --> 00:58:03,260
Yes, you are. What do you want?

931
00:58:03,284 --> 00:58:04,524
I don't want anything from you.

932
00:58:04,552 --> 00:58:06,120
Stop being weird.

933
00:58:10,691 --> 00:58:11,859
Fine.

934
00:58:12,226 --> 00:58:13,561
What?

935
00:58:14,862 --> 00:58:17,231
Sorry, didn't mean to
gaslight you again.

936
00:58:17,264 --> 00:58:19,300
You're being a bitch.

937
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:20,868
So are you.

938
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,889
So, why did you leave?

939
00:58:41,922 --> 00:58:44,025
- I had to get some air.
- That's a lie.

940
00:58:44,058 --> 00:58:45,826
No, it's not. I
wasn't feeling well,

941
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:47,828
and I had to get some air.

942
00:58:47,862 --> 00:58:49,563
Be honest!

943
00:58:52,299 --> 00:58:54,201
Fine.

944
00:58:57,972 --> 00:59:00,908
I thought we weren't friends
anymore and so I freaked out.

945
00:59:03,744 --> 00:59:04,945
You did?

946
00:59:05,613 --> 00:59:06,981
Yeah.

947
00:59:08,249 --> 00:59:09,726
I just couldn't sit in
that classroom anymore.

948
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,552
I felt like I was...

949
00:59:13,187 --> 00:59:15,823
I told Moreh Klein that
I bled all over the seat.

950
00:59:15,856 --> 00:59:16,957
(laughing)

951
00:59:16,991 --> 00:59:19,126
I'm sure she loved that.

952
00:59:27,401 --> 00:59:28,903
I thought I...

953
00:59:30,004 --> 00:59:31,806
weirded you out.

954
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:33,741
So I thought I'd
give you some space.

955
00:59:35,776 --> 00:59:38,312
Why would you weird me out?

956
00:59:40,414 --> 00:59:41,982
I don't know.

957
00:59:42,983 --> 00:59:45,686
It was stupid. I'm sorry.

958
00:59:47,154 --> 00:59:48,589
It's fine.

959
00:59:53,027 --> 00:59:55,329
It's just, seeing you
hanging out with Elaina

960
00:59:55,362 --> 00:59:57,631
kind of freaked me out.

961
00:59:57,665 --> 01:00:00,301
- She's actually really not that bad.
- Shut up.

962
01:00:00,334 --> 01:00:02,303
She sucks and
nothing you say or do

963
01:00:02,336 --> 01:00:04,138
will make me change my mind.

964
01:00:05,272 --> 01:00:07,108
She let me hit her vape.

965
01:00:07,141 --> 01:00:08,409
Ew, what?

966
01:00:08,442 --> 01:00:09,810
(Carrie laughing)

967
01:00:09,844 --> 01:00:12,046
Yeah, it was pretty fun.

968
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:13,781
That's so gross.

969
01:00:14,949 --> 01:00:17,618
- What flavor?
- Cucumber.

970
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:20,387
Cool.

971
01:00:41,275 --> 01:00:43,410
Today's been, like...

972
01:00:43,444 --> 01:00:46,680
- so fucked up.
- I know.

973
01:00:50,751 --> 01:00:53,320
I just keep on thinking, like,

974
01:00:55,256 --> 01:00:56,957
why she did it.

975
01:00:58,392 --> 01:01:00,337
I mean, like, I know it's
a stupid question to ask,

976
01:01:00,361 --> 01:01:03,164
but, like,

977
01:01:03,197 --> 01:01:06,300
why does anyone do
that sort of thing?

978
01:01:07,468 --> 01:01:09,003
What?

979
01:01:10,204 --> 01:01:11,805
Kill themselves?

980
01:01:14,041 --> 01:01:16,043
I mean, like, yeah.

981
01:01:19,313 --> 01:01:22,049
I don't know.

982
01:01:22,082 --> 01:01:25,019
I think she might've just
been depressed, you know?

983
01:01:25,052 --> 01:01:27,354
You don't have to answer.

984
01:01:31,292 --> 01:01:33,427
We're going to be okay though.

985
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:36,330
Nothing has changed between us.

986
01:01:38,232 --> 01:01:41,001
I mean, you still want to
be my best friend, right?

987
01:01:43,771 --> 01:01:45,839
Yeah, I do.

988
01:01:46,874 --> 01:01:48,275
Okay.

989
01:01:48,309 --> 01:01:49,777
So there's no problem.

990
01:01:54,516 --> 01:01:56,050
Um...

991
01:01:57,151 --> 01:01:58,953
Samantha had a crush on you?

992
01:01:58,986 --> 01:02:02,456
- What?
- Elaina told me that,

993
01:02:02,489 --> 01:02:06,393
um, Samantha had a
crush on you and,

994
01:02:06,427 --> 01:02:08,495
and you told everybody, but, uh,

995
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:10,864
you didn't tell me.

996
01:02:10,898 --> 01:02:13,133
Why does that matter?

997
01:02:13,167 --> 01:02:16,070
Because I'm your best friend,
why didn't you tell me?

998
01:02:16,103 --> 01:02:19,106
Oh, 'cause it was
dumb. I was drunk.

999
01:02:19,139 --> 01:02:22,042
You were sad about not
being invited to the party.

1000
01:02:22,076 --> 01:02:25,012
I didn't want to
hurt your feelings.

1001
01:02:25,045 --> 01:02:26,880
Well, that kind of
makes me feel worse

1002
01:02:26,914 --> 01:02:30,150
- that you didn't tell me.
- She didn't kill herself

1003
01:02:30,184 --> 01:02:32,462
- because she had a crush on me.
- I didn't say that she did.

1004
01:02:32,486 --> 01:02:34,455
Okay, so then why did
you ask it like that?

1005
01:02:34,488 --> 01:02:36,056
I didn't ask it like anything.

1006
01:02:36,090 --> 01:02:37,891
I didn't make her kill herself.

1007
01:02:37,925 --> 01:02:39,326
I didn't say that
you did, I just...

1008
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,395
Okay, so then what
were you trying to ask?

1009
01:02:41,428 --> 01:02:45,032
Nothing! Just...
just forget about it.

1010
01:02:47,569 --> 01:02:49,870
Okay, I will.

1011
01:02:57,579 --> 01:03:01,882
I mean, it's, like, not on you.

1012
01:03:01,915 --> 01:03:05,886
I mean, she had other friends.

1013
01:03:05,919 --> 01:03:07,254
I mean, like, she was...

1014
01:03:07,288 --> 01:03:09,790
She was invited to the
party and I wasn't.

1015
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:14,028
I guess.

1016
01:03:16,096 --> 01:03:18,132
I should have told you.
It's just, it was like...

1017
01:03:18,165 --> 01:03:20,334
It was weird and then she died.

1018
01:03:20,367 --> 01:03:22,469
It's whatever.

1019
01:03:25,272 --> 01:03:28,409
I just didn't know what to do.

1020
01:03:28,442 --> 01:03:29,977
I didn't like her like that,

1021
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:34,148
but she was, like,
a nice person.

1022
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:37,519
She was.

1023
01:03:40,522 --> 01:03:42,423
I hope she doesn't hate me.

1024
01:03:44,158 --> 01:03:46,460
I don't want anyone to hate me.

1025
01:03:46,493 --> 01:03:48,228
Even if they're dead.

1026
01:03:54,435 --> 01:03:56,503
I don't hate you.

1027
01:03:56,538 --> 01:03:58,072
(laughing)

1028
01:03:59,541 --> 01:04:01,875
I don't hate you too.

1029
01:04:05,946 --> 01:04:08,082
You gonna go back to class?

1030
01:04:08,115 --> 01:04:10,951
No, I think I want
to do something else.

1031
01:04:10,984 --> 01:04:14,288
Like what? My dad gets
here in, like, 30 minutes.

1032
01:04:14,321 --> 01:04:17,024
We'll find something fun to do.

1033
01:04:17,057 --> 01:04:19,594
Okay, I don't want to,
like, lay backwards

1034
01:04:19,627 --> 01:04:21,362
on the hill
outside. (laughing)

1035
01:04:21,395 --> 01:04:24,398
Neither do I. We're
not in fifth grade.

1036
01:04:24,431 --> 01:04:27,368
I want to do
something more adult.

1037
01:04:28,402 --> 01:04:29,637
Adult?

1038
01:04:30,638 --> 01:04:32,373
Come on, trust me.

1039
01:04:32,406 --> 01:04:34,341
We can't be sad and
thinking about this

1040
01:04:34,375 --> 01:04:36,043
for the rest of our lives.

1041
01:04:36,076 --> 01:04:39,012
- Okay, what is it?
- You'll see.

1042
01:04:41,415 --> 01:04:45,452
Okay, so, what's the surprise?

1043
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,489
Kiss me.

1044
01:04:48,523 --> 01:04:50,224
- What?
- Kiss me.

1045
01:04:50,257 --> 01:04:53,494
- Please.
- I, uh...

1046
01:04:53,528 --> 01:04:55,095
What the fuck?

1047
01:05:03,971 --> 01:05:06,373
(ethereal music)

1048
01:05:30,197 --> 01:05:31,331
[Tristan] Uh, hello?

1049
01:05:31,365 --> 01:05:32,700
Sorry.

1050
01:05:32,734 --> 01:05:34,334
[Tristan] Sorry, sorry.

1051
01:05:34,368 --> 01:05:35,936
[Hannah] Hey, Tristan.

1052
01:05:37,505 --> 01:05:40,040
Hannah, what is he doing here?

1053
01:05:40,073 --> 01:05:41,743
We're all gonna hang out, duh.

1054
01:05:41,776 --> 01:05:44,612
Like we hung up before
in the bathroom.

1055
01:05:44,646 --> 01:05:47,147
- What?
- Come on, be cool.

1056
01:05:49,249 --> 01:05:51,553
- Uh, yeah.
- Don't be jealous.

1057
01:05:51,586 --> 01:05:54,622
[Tristan] I thought we were just...
I thought you were just joking.

1058
01:05:54,656 --> 01:05:57,692
I didn't think we were
actually going to do this.

1059
01:05:57,725 --> 01:06:00,093
[Hannah] Why wouldn't we?

1060
01:06:00,127 --> 01:06:03,063
Can I talk to you for a second?

1061
01:06:03,096 --> 01:06:04,566
Of course.

1062
01:06:04,599 --> 01:06:06,534
We'll be right back.

1063
01:06:16,811 --> 01:06:21,583
You know I've never, like...
like, done this before.

1064
01:06:21,616 --> 01:06:24,418
I mean, you've, like,
kissed other people before.

1065
01:06:24,451 --> 01:06:26,487
Yeah, but I haven't
done, like, everything.

1066
01:06:26,521 --> 01:06:28,690
I don't want this to
be how it happens.

1067
01:06:28,723 --> 01:06:30,625
Okay, well, you don't
have to do that.

1068
01:06:30,658 --> 01:06:35,195
I can do that and he'll
just, like, play with you.

1069
01:06:35,229 --> 01:06:36,731
Play with me.

1070
01:06:36,764 --> 01:06:39,567
You know, like,
touch you down there.

1071
01:06:39,601 --> 01:06:41,201
I know what fingering is.

1072
01:06:41,235 --> 01:06:43,403
I wasn't trying to
say that you didn't.

1073
01:06:43,437 --> 01:06:45,372
Why the hell would
I want to do this?

1074
01:06:45,405 --> 01:06:47,775
You know, I'm actually
really worried about you.

1075
01:06:47,809 --> 01:06:50,512
Don't you ever want
to try this stuff?

1076
01:06:50,545 --> 01:06:53,113
You can't avoid it forever.

1077
01:06:54,281 --> 01:06:57,117
Tristan thinks you're
so hot and cool.

1078
01:06:57,150 --> 01:06:59,353
He literally couldn't
stop talking about you.

1079
01:06:59,386 --> 01:07:03,056
You're just saying that so you can
play out your stupid, gross fantasy.

1080
01:07:03,090 --> 01:07:04,391
It's fun.

1081
01:07:04,424 --> 01:07:07,762
- You're using me.
- No, I'm not.

1082
01:07:07,795 --> 01:07:10,163
Tristan is only doing this
because he wants to go with you

1083
01:07:10,197 --> 01:07:13,433
because he's so, so into you.

1084
01:07:13,467 --> 01:07:16,103
Don't overthink this.
Let's just do it.

1085
01:07:16,136 --> 01:07:17,572
Why do you even want to do this?

1086
01:07:17,605 --> 01:07:22,175
You were, like,
in love with him.

1087
01:07:22,209 --> 01:07:26,781
I mean, we're both
gonna, like, be with him.

1088
01:07:26,814 --> 01:07:27,849
What if I don't want to?

1089
01:07:27,882 --> 01:07:29,784
Why wouldn't you want to?

1090
01:07:31,151 --> 01:07:33,588
Why can't you just
hook up with him?

1091
01:07:33,621 --> 01:07:36,524
I mean, I like him,
I really like him,

1092
01:07:36,558 --> 01:07:40,127
but it's so obvious
that he likes you more.

1093
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:43,263
So I thought maybe
we could share.

1094
01:07:43,297 --> 01:07:44,766
Share, got it.

1095
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:47,434
It's a fun thing. It's
not, like, a serious thing.

1096
01:07:47,467 --> 01:07:49,837
You want to have sex
in our synagogue.

1097
01:07:49,871 --> 01:07:52,306
- Hook up.
- Isn't that sex?

1098
01:07:52,339 --> 01:07:54,742
I don't know, we'll just,
like, see what happens.

1099
01:07:54,776 --> 01:07:56,644
It's Samantha's funeral.

1100
01:07:56,678 --> 01:07:58,713
Who cares? She's dead.

1101
01:07:58,746 --> 01:08:01,214
Plus, her ghost didn't
stop you from kissing me.

1102
01:08:02,282 --> 01:08:04,117
That was...

1103
01:08:04,151 --> 01:08:05,820
That was different.

1104
01:08:05,853 --> 01:08:08,790
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

1105
01:08:08,823 --> 01:08:10,725
You've been fucking
with my head all day.

1106
01:08:10,758 --> 01:08:13,260
- No, I haven't.
- Yes, you have.

1107
01:08:13,293 --> 01:08:14,805
You know that I like you
and now you're using me

1108
01:08:14,829 --> 01:08:16,363
so you can get with Tristan.

1109
01:08:16,396 --> 01:08:19,667
No, I'm not. I
didn't know anything.

1110
01:08:19,701 --> 01:08:22,336
- I thought you would think this was fun.
- Stop saying that.

1111
01:08:22,369 --> 01:08:24,782
This isn't fun. I'm not having
fun. I'm not going to have fun.

1112
01:08:24,806 --> 01:08:26,641
Why did you kiss me
in the first place?

1113
01:08:26,674 --> 01:08:29,644
I told you. I wanted to
know if I'm a good kisser.

1114
01:08:33,781 --> 01:08:35,315
Okay.

1115
01:08:37,585 --> 01:08:39,386
(sighing)

1116
01:08:41,789 --> 01:08:43,156
Okay.

1117
01:08:43,958 --> 01:08:45,359
So, do you want to go back?

1118
01:08:45,392 --> 01:08:47,762
- You're so selfish.
- What?

1119
01:08:49,731 --> 01:08:51,365
Do you like me at all?

1120
01:08:51,398 --> 01:08:53,534
Yes, of course, I like you.

1121
01:08:53,568 --> 01:08:55,803
I love you. You're
my best friend.

1122
01:08:55,837 --> 01:08:58,305
But not more than that?

1123
01:08:59,641 --> 01:09:01,341
More than best friends?

1124
01:09:02,610 --> 01:09:05,580
Like, you wouldn't
want to hook up with me

1125
01:09:05,613 --> 01:09:07,682
if Tristan wasn't here.

1126
01:09:08,616 --> 01:09:09,817
No.

1127
01:09:11,919 --> 01:09:13,554
Would you?

1128
01:09:15,455 --> 01:09:16,891
I mean...

1129
01:09:17,959 --> 01:09:20,293
I don't know.

1130
01:09:20,327 --> 01:09:22,195
But you're going
to prom with Ben.

1131
01:09:22,229 --> 01:09:23,564
Just because I'm...

1132
01:09:25,265 --> 01:09:28,168
Look, I really
liked kissing you,

1133
01:09:29,704 --> 01:09:31,438
and I thought you liked it too.

1134
01:09:32,674 --> 01:09:35,242
Carrie, I don't think
of you that way.

1135
01:09:35,275 --> 01:09:36,744
We're like sisters.

1136
01:09:36,778 --> 01:09:39,614
We're, like, closer than
sisters, we're like...

1137
01:09:39,647 --> 01:09:42,282
I don't know, and it's not like
I don't think you're pretty,

1138
01:09:42,315 --> 01:09:43,885
or smart, or whatever.

1139
01:09:43,918 --> 01:09:45,553
And it's cool if you
like me that way.

1140
01:09:45,586 --> 01:09:47,588
It's, like, I just, I
don't like you that way,

1141
01:09:47,622 --> 01:09:50,591
but it's good if you do?

1142
01:09:57,431 --> 01:09:59,232
[Tristan] Is
everything all right?

1143
01:09:59,266 --> 01:10:02,637
Yeah! Um, everything's great.

1144
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:04,371
Right, Carrie?

1145
01:10:08,710 --> 01:10:10,611
It's nice to see you, Tristan.

1146
01:10:14,481 --> 01:10:16,416
So, um...

1147
01:10:17,685 --> 01:10:20,855
maybe we could hang
out, just the two of us?

1148
01:10:20,888 --> 01:10:23,958
- Is... is she okay?
- Yeah.

1149
01:10:23,991 --> 01:10:25,492
She seemed really upset.

1150
01:10:25,526 --> 01:10:27,729
Oh, yeah, she's fine.
Just a long day.

1151
01:10:27,762 --> 01:10:30,330
Did she know this was
gonna happen or...?

1152
01:10:30,363 --> 01:10:34,035
Totally, she just, like,
gets like that sometimes.

1153
01:10:34,068 --> 01:10:36,537
I feel so bad.

1154
01:10:36,571 --> 01:10:39,239
Don't! Don't, I mean,

1155
01:10:40,373 --> 01:10:42,375
maybe I can make it up to you.

1156
01:10:42,409 --> 01:10:45,012
Um... my mom works late,

1157
01:10:45,046 --> 01:10:48,348
- so I have the house to... my house for myself.
- What?!

1158
01:10:48,381 --> 01:10:52,486
- What? Are you serious right now?
- Yeah, I mean, totally.

1159
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:56,524
I thought we were just gonna hang out. I
didn't think you actually wanted to do...

1160
01:10:56,557 --> 01:10:59,426
- I thought it would be...
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

1161
01:11:01,028 --> 01:11:05,600
Look, I'm... I'm not
interested in you at all and...

1162
01:11:06,667 --> 01:11:08,970
Fuck, I'm sor...

1163
01:11:09,003 --> 01:11:10,805
I gotta go. This is...

1164
01:11:12,006 --> 01:11:13,941
It's really not a big deal.

1165
01:11:14,976 --> 01:11:16,644
Okay, see you around!

1166
01:11:16,677 --> 01:11:17,945
Shit.

1167
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:20,014
Shit.

1168
01:11:28,523 --> 01:11:29,991
(crying)

1169
01:11:33,127 --> 01:11:35,596
(students chatter)

1170
01:11:49,777 --> 01:11:52,647
(ethereal music)

1171
01:11:55,616 --> 01:11:57,350
(music stops abruptly)

1172
01:12:17,705 --> 01:12:19,807
(chatter)

1173
01:12:28,115 --> 01:12:29,717
Shit.

1174
01:12:39,894 --> 01:12:42,395
[Zack] I just really
need to sleep right now.

1175
01:12:42,429 --> 01:12:44,665
Nothing feels real.

1176
01:12:44,699 --> 01:12:49,003
Like, I can see the
code in the simulation.

1177
01:12:49,036 --> 01:12:51,038
Hey, Mom. Yeah,
we just got out.

1178
01:12:51,072 --> 01:12:52,740
I'm gonna be home later.

1179
01:12:52,773 --> 01:12:55,977
Mr. Lowstein's gonna taking
me and Carrie to get food.

1180
01:13:07,622 --> 01:13:08,890
(high heel breaks)

1181
01:13:08,923 --> 01:13:12,026
Ugh, seriously? Hey!

1182
01:13:12,894 --> 01:13:14,662
Carrie, hey!

1183
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:18,132
Would you just look at me?

1184
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:22,136
What, are you, like, mad at me?

1185
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:27,575
Carrie.

1186
01:13:40,021 --> 01:13:42,623
- I didn't mean to hurt you.
- (cellphone vibrates)

1187
01:13:47,128 --> 01:13:51,498
- Hey, I'm here.
- Oh, my God, Carrie.

1188
01:13:54,168 --> 01:13:55,502
Carrie!

1189
01:14:10,017 --> 01:14:12,253
