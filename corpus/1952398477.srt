1
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,610
When all this started...

2
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,970
our families had lived in Knockglen
for as long as anybody could remember...

3
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,840
and in lreland...

4
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:55,440
people have very long memories.

5
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,390
Till shortly before l was born,
the country was ruled for 1,000 years...

6
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,390
by heathen invaders...

7
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,450
as the nuns called them.

8
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,690
We'd survived the Vikings
and the Normans...

9
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,290
and even the English.

10
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,800
lt was faith in the Church,
we were told...

11
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,630
that gave Knockglen
its strength to survive...

12
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,330
and after all that surviving,
the whole village was there...

13
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,710
when my two best friends and l
were having our confirmation day.

14
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,970
There was Eve...

15
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,840
and me, Benny...

16
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,760
and Nan.

17
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,560
We were inseparable, the three of us.

18
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,300
Nan Mahon was beautiful...

19
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:52,700
and because of it, she never doubted
that anything she wanted would be hers.

20
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,680
There was me, of course:
Benny-- Bernadette Hogan...

21
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,270
the apple of my parents' eyes...

22
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,280
an only child, but my mother fed me
as though l were two.

23
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,820
- That's my little princess.
- My mother.

24
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,220
Don't they look just gorgeous?

25
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,020
And there was Eve Malone.

26
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,990
Daddy, can Eve be in it?

27
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,590
- l'm sure she can.
- ls that all right, Sisters?

28
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,060
Eve was an orphan,
raised by the nuns...

29
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:21,100
but you know,
that only made her special.

30
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,140
Big smiles all around again.

31
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,410
Beautiful.

32
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,400
That was the day Eve took us
to the cottage her father had left her.

33
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,470
He'd been a gardener
for the Westwards...

34
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,820
the Protestant family
that owned the big house on the hill.

35
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,010
Old Mr. Westward
never went out anymore...

36
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,960
but on our way to the cottage,
we saw his son, Simon...

37
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,330
riding his horse
and looking grand...

38
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,830
as usual.

39
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,070
ls it really your very own?

40
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,980
The nuns are keeping it for me.
When l'm 18, l'm going to live in it.

41
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,840
- Are you?
- You can live in it, too, if you like.

42
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,280
We're moving to Dublin, me dad says.

43
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,280
Well, you can live with me, Benny.

44
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,910
l don't think me ma and da
would let me.

45
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,580
When you're 18,
you can do anything you like.

46
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,990
Good morning, ladies.

47
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,560
Come on, faster.

48
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,370
Wait!

49
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,420
Years later...

50
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,790
by the time Eve and l graduated
from the local convent school...

51
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:51,020
Nan was long gone to Dublin...

52
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,090
so there was only me to walk my friend
up the long path to the Westwards'...

53
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,600
to attend to some important business
she had there.

54
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,270
Do you want me to come in with you?

55
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,760
Who is she?

56
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,420
Eve Malone,
the girl the nuns brought up.

57
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,960
The gardener's child.

58
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,830
We're paying for her education.

59
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,490
l've got seven subjects
in the leaf insert, two with honors.

60
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,700
The fees are 65 pounds a year
for four years.

61
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,850
l got it.

62
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,220
65 pounds a year.

63
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,690
Well done!

64
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,760
Come on, slowcoach.

65
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,300
- We're going to be college students.
- l know we are. lsn't it great?

66
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,970
- Hello, Mrs. Healy.
- A fine day, girls.

67
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,910
l know, l know.

68
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,420
Hello, Mr. Flood.

69
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,890
Oh, God, there's my da
with the creepy Sean Walsh.

70
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,950
- Hello, girls.
- Hello, Dad.

71
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,430
l was just after telling your father...

72
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,760
"We won't be letting go of her.

73
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,890
She won't be led astray in the big city
like some."

74
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,400
Won't you be back on the ten-past-6:00
every night?

75
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,030
- We're going to miss the bus. Bye.
- Yes, bye.

76
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,860
The ten-past-6:00 bus every night!

77
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,760
They'd only let me go
if l carried on living at home.

78
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,230
How can l tell people l have to go home
every night as if l were a simpleton?

79
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,860
At least you don't have to live
in a convent.

80
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,430
Do you think l like going from a convent
in Knockglen to one in Dublin?

81
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,310
We'll find ways round it.
We'll knock them dead.

82
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,540
Oh, will we?

83
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,530
l'd have recognized you anywhere.
You haven't changed a bit.

84
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,040
My God, haven't we?
l'm going home now then.

85
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,100
You look gorgeous altogether.
You first-years as well?

86
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,900
- First day.
- And me, as a student.

87
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,310
l've been here for socials and hops.

88
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,410
The Dublin sophisticate.
You'll have to show us the ropes.

89
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,930
lt's lovely to see you again.
Three girls from Knockglen.

90
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,560
Hello, Jack.

91
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,660
Looking very lovely, as always.

92
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,900
Thank you. So are you.

93
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,530
You're very kind.

94
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,160
You're very welcome.

95
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,370
- Are you coming to the match today?
- We might.

96
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,940
Well, see you there if you do.

97
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,620
Who is he?

98
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:52,060
Him? Jack Foley,
the blue-eyed boy.

99
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,060
He played for lreland schools.

100
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,460
Father's a doctor.
Did you like the look of him?

101
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,200
lt says here, " lnaugural lecture,
main theater, Professor Flynn."

102
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,700
Where's that?

103
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,640
This foundation course
for first-year students...

104
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,640
used to be known as " Baby Latin."

105
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,850
"Baby Latin," you see.

106
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,320
Like baby food.

107
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,660
This year...

108
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,590
to broaden our frame of reference...

109
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,930
l propose to take a glance
at some other societies--

110
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,870
principally that of the Trobriand
lslanders of the South Pacific...

111
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,880
as described
in Bronislaw Malinowski's great work...

112
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,470
of anthropology:

113
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,650
"The Sexual Life of Savages."

114
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,080
By studying...

115
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,920
the rites of passage--

116
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,340
Come on!

117
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,840
Come on!

118
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,680
- Oh, no!
- He'll be grand.

119
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,530
Okay, come on, Dublin.

120
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:49,370
- Well done. You were great.
- Not so clever just then.

121
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,140
- Are you all right?
- l'm fine, thanks. Solid wood.

122
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,650
- Come on, lads.
- Do you think you might introduce us?

123
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,510
All right then.
Jack Foley, Bernadette Hogan.

124
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,020
And Eve Malone.

125
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,650
Delighted to meet you.

126
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:09,320
We're going to Murphy's Pub
on the quays after. Will you come?

127
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,560
About 7:00.

128
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,100
Love to.

129
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,860
l can't.

130
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,400
l have to get
the ten-past-6:00 bus home.

131
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,900
Well, another time then.
See you.

132
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,830
10, 20...

133
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,340
30, 40...

134
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,510
42 pounds.

135
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,480
42 pounds a month?

136
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,240
You shut your hole,
or l'll shut it for you.

137
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,210
Nobody's going to say
that Brian Mahon's not generous.

138
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,780
- No?
- Thank you, Daddy.

139
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,160
That's more than generous. l hope
you think you've made a good investment.

140
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,960
l'll make you proud of me...

141
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,590
and proud of yourself
for putting me through college.

142
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,440
You won't regret it. l promise.

143
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,330
You're a good girl.

144
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,320
Thank you.

145
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,460
Thank you. That's stupendous.
Did you have a good day?

146
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:24,190
Had a great day.
l went to a lecture and a rugby match.

147
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,860
What did she say?

148
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,700
She went to a lecture
and a rugby match.

149
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,200
That's nice.

150
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,860
ln contrast
to many other human communities...

151
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,540
which segregates the sexes
during adolescence...

152
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:42,070
the Trobriand lslanders allow...

153
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:47,050
their boys and girls
complete freedom...

154
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,450
of access to each other...

155
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,260
from puberty...

156
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,850
through to adulthood.

157
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:58,630
Malinowski found them to be...

158
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,260
a very happy and contented people.

159
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,070
Bernadette, will you hurry up?

160
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,660
The double entry system
is your only man.

161
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,670
Believe me, Mr. Hogan.

162
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,900
You'll never regret it.

163
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,070
There you are.

164
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,840
We haven't been here
since last Christmas.

165
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,040
We were going to have
a Thanksgiving party.

166
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,380
That's nice.

167
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:56,550
What do you do up there?
You just, what, study?

168
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:01,220
- l want to be a teacher.
- Teacher?

169
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,030
That's very good.
You know, personally, l admire brains.

170
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,930
My brother Charlie is a brainy guy.
He had a couple of years of college.

171
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,910
lt isn't just brains.
lt's--

172
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,910
lt's how you use them.

173
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,910
Yeah, l get your thought.

174
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,880
You know l seen you
a lot of times before?

175
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,250
Remember parochial school...

176
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,310
out on Paluski Street,
seven, eight years ago?

177
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,410
- You had your hair--
- Braids.

178
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:32,360
Looked like a hunk of rope.
You had wires on your teeth...

179
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,620
and glasses.

180
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,360
You was really a mess.

181
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:41,200
l can get home all right now.
Thanks.

182
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,690
Don't get sore.

183
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:47,570
l'm just kidding you a little bit.
l just mean to tell you...

184
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,940
that you grew up very nice.

185
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,810
- Thanks.
- Get off!

186
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,780
You don't remember me, do you?

187
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,550
l remembered you
the first moment l saw you.

188
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,210
By the nose, huh?

189
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,450
That was a very interesting film.

190
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,290
Oh, you thought so?

191
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,290
Want to go to Sullivan's
for a bag of chips?

192
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,300
- No, thank you.
- l told your parents we'd be going.

193
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:15,330
- ls something the matter?
- Yes.

194
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,170
l don't want people thinking
that you and l are an article...

195
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,210
because we are not.

196
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,510
And l don't want you thinking
that we are, because we're not.

197
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:30,150
l don't feel that way about you.
That's all there is to it. l'm sorry.

198
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,710
l think your father...

199
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,690
would be very disappointed
to hear you say that, Benny.

200
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,650
l don't think you're in the situation
to be so proud and choosy.

201
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,230
Good night, Sean.

202
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,580
How long since your last confession?

203
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,450
Two weeks, Father.

204
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,150
Go on, my child.

205
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,550
l've had wrong thoughts
about my parents.

206
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,420
They want me to go to the university...

207
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,430
but they want me to stay
the little child as well.

208
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,660
And there's this man they want me
to marry for the sake of the business.

209
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,800
He's awful, Father.
l could never love him...

210
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,040
and l don't know why
they can't see that.

211
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,420
l do love them, but l'm finding it
awful hard to honor them.

212
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,250
ls there anything else?

213
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,920
l've had impure thoughts.

214
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,790
Did you entertain them?

215
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,640
l don't find any of it
tempting, really.

216
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:03,610
l don't look forward to that at all.
l do want children...

217
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,610
but it's such an ugly business,
don't you think?

218
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,670
- l don't know.
- You do.

219
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,480
Remember that time
we saw Willie Burns in the wood?

220
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,580
When he was playing with himself.

221
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,150
That horrible great red thing
he had on him.

222
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,330
Well, maybe
if you really loved a boy.

223
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,660
l do know what you mean, though.

224
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,500
Have a look in on the cottage.
We can do it up during the holidays.

225
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,130
- Maybe have a party.
- Great! See you Monday.

226
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,840
See you!

227
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,220
- There you are.
- Thanks, Teasie.

228
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,720
Thank you.

229
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,900
- Hello, Jack.
- Hey, Benny. You live here?

230
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,000
Yes. What are you doing here?

231
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,240
Father, this is Bernadette Hogan.
She's at the university as well.

232
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,250
Pleasure to meet you.

233
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:23,420
l wanted to visit an old colleague
of mine who hasn't been well.

234
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,120
Jack was good enough to drive me.

235
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:28,860
Well, couple of hours all right?

236
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:32,390
- Could you bear with him that long?
- l should think so.

237
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,900
Just about.

238
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,830
This is a nice surprise.

239
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,850
lt must be a desperate thing
to be a doctor...

240
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:51,710
to have to tell people
that they're dying and can't be cured.

241
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:54,950
l don't think l could bear that.

242
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,720
No. Nor me.
l'd run a mile first.

243
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:01,450
But you're going to be a doctor.

244
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:04,190
l know.
lsn't it drastic?

245
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:09,070
lt's not just that. l'm squeamish
about cutting people open...

246
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,300
and looking at their insides.

247
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,510
l get faint at the sight of blood.

248
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,770
lt's true.
l just pass out.

249
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,970
Have you told your father about this?

250
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,920
He says it's just a passing phase.

251
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,250
Maybe he's right.
lt is a great thing to do.

252
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,420
l just don't know
if l've got it in me.

253
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,590
What do you like to do?

254
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,230
l like sports.

255
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:46,600
Ah, Benny.
l just love to clown around.

256
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,610
l don't believe that.

257
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,450
lt's easy to talk to you.
You know that?

258
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,850
l feel as if l could
tell you anything.

259
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,480
You're very solid, aren't you?

260
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:11,360
Yes. Everyone notices that.

261
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:15,560
Solid. Beef to the heels,
like a Mullingar heifer.

262
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,730
No. l didn't mean that.

263
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,240
l meant...

264
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,280
you're really there.

265
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,570
You really know
who you are, don't you?

266
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,880
Well, yes,
of course l do.

267
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,620
Sometimes l feel as if
l'm hardly there at all.

268
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,720
Just trying to be things
for other people, you know?

269
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,390
lt was a great film altogether.

270
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,570
When she drops her glove, and
he picks it up and tries it on--

271
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,130
lt was so delicate.

272
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,640
lf he tried my glove on,
it would probably be too big for him.

273
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,380
What you doing?

274
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,940
About the same. See?

275
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,510
Not too bad then.

276
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,550
Not too bad.

277
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:16,830
Some of us are getting up a gang
to go to the college ball.

278
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,830
The big one at the Hibernian?

279
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,890
- Will you come?
- Me?

280
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,870
Really?

281
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,630
l'd love to.

282
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:39,080
There's a lot to be said
for these big, soft girls.

283
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:42,350
That one had a nice, soft look
about her.

284
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,690
Nice eyes.

285
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,230
Beautiful hair.

286
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,530
Lovely smile.

287
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,130
Fine set of teeth on her.

288
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,200
You don't miss much, do you, Dad?

289
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,770
l do not.

290
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,440
Jack Foley asked me
to go to the college ball.

291
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,270
That's great.

292
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,670
We're all going.
We're all in the gang.

293
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,730
Rosemary, Sheila Keohane.

294
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,670
Safety in numbers.

295
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,940
He did ask you personally.

296
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,550
He did make you special.

297
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,590
lt's all right. lt's fine!

298
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:57,060
We'll all go in a gang.
lt'll be great.

299
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,570
God, what am l going to wear? l've
nothing l don't look like a whale in.

300
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,730
l have nothing, full stop.

301
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:12,180
Maybe if l starve myself entirely
between now and Saturday--

302
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,180
You'll be gorgeous.

303
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,580
Look at those!

304
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:26,420
You've cut too much out of it.

305
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,430
No. Just about enough, l'd say.

306
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,490
lt's indecent.
Won't they fall out?

307
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,900
lf you've got them, flaunt them.
Keep your shoulders back.

308
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,490
- You'll be fine.
- Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

309
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,470
- l look like the prow of a ship.
- You look great.

310
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,130
Oh, glory, don't!

311
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:44,970
l do, don't l?
We all do.

312
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,110
Thanks, Nan.
You're a brilliant person altogether.

313
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,220
Here we go, girls.

314
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,520
Thanks.
How much did you say it was?

315
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,650
- Twelve bob.
- Have you got change?

316
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,320
How much is it?

317
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,160
Good evening, ladies.

318
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,890
Hello.
What are you doing here?

319
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,900
Are you going to the dance?

320
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:13,030
No, to my very great regret.

321
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,440
Simon Westward, Nan Mahon.

322
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,480
How do you do?

323
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,540
- Enjoy the dance.
- Thanks. We will.

324
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,920
lsn't this just as it should be?

325
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,620
lt's perfect altogether.

326
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:10,530
Right. Let's seize the moment.
Nan?

327
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,620
Will you dance?

328
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,520
Like to dance?

329
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,190
- Will you risk it?
- l'd love to.

330
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:32,540
This is nice, isn't it?
All of us going together.

331
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,810
You want to know how it happened?

332
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,840
Jack couldn't decide which one of you
he liked the best, so he asked you all.

333
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,550
lt looks as though
he's decided now, doesn't it?

334
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,710
l wouldn't be too sure.

335
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:46,160
Did you know
who you wanted to invite, Aidan?

336
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,220
Yes. Your friend Eve.

337
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,820
So why are you dancing with me
and not her?

338
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,530
Because l'm such a devious personality.

339
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,630
Do you think there's a chance there?
Would she go out with me if l asked her?

340
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,370
She might.
She's got very eccentric tastes.

341
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,430
There's hope for us all, Aidan.

342
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:06,450
There is so.
Watch out. Tricky step.

343
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:05,830
Don't you ever shut up?
Get out of here!

344
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,460
He likes you. He does.

345
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,670
- He talked about you the whole time.
- lf he likes me so much...

346
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,870
why does he spend the whole time
with you and Rosemary?

347
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:19,580
Let's face it. Why would he look at me?
He could have anyone at all.

348
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:23,420
No, he couldn't.
He couldn't have me, for a start.

349
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:26,390
l'm not interested in Jack,
not like that.

350
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:30,190
Or any of these boys.
They're just to practice on.

351
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:12,300
Go on. Ruin yourself.

352
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:21,010
Here's another one of your favorites.

353
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,920
- Are you all right?
- l'm just going to the ladies'.

354
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,090
Where you off to?

355
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:44,900
l was just coming to look for you.
Are you ready for a dance now?

356
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:46,910
You took your time, didn't you?

357
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,770
l'm sorry.

358
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,900
Don't be upset.
l was saving you till last.

359
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,040
l always save the best till last.

360
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,710
Don't be angry, please.
Come and dance.

361
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,780
You mustn't mess me about.

362
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:11,160
l know l may look like a rhinoceros,
but l have quite a thin skin really.

363
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,460
So just be a bit careful with me...

364
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,590
or l'll flatten you.

365
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,070
l won't mess you about.

366
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,570
Promise.

367
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,080
Come on.

368
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,410
Come and dance.

369
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,660
Good morning.
ls that the Westward residence?

370
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:57,260
Yes, ma'am.
Who do you wish to speak to?

371
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:01,770
Sir Victor Chamberlain would like
to speak to Mr. Simon Westward.

372
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:05,000
- l'm sorry. He isn't here.
- Oh, dear.

373
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,210
lt is rather urgent.

374
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,620
Do you know where Sir Victor
could find him?

375
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:15,210
- He's lunching at the Hibernian today.
- Benson! Rufus! Come on, boys!

376
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,920
You could try telephoning him there
a bit later.

377
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,580
Thank you so much.

378
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,420
Good day.

379
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,350
- Your usual table?
- Yes.

380
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,430
Hold on.

381
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,910
- Hello there.
- Hello.

382
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:12,380
- Dining alone?
- l'm afraid l am.

383
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:16,400
My father was to meet me, but he's
just phoned to say he can't make it.

384
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,750
ln that case,
why don't we lunch together?

385
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:21,050
Thank you.
That would be lovely.

386
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,060
This is a marvelous coincidence.

387
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,430
lsn't it?

388
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:40,230
l can tell you the truth.

389
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,070
What do you mostly tell?

390
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,470
l think l mostly tell people...

391
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:50,280
what l think they want to hear,
especially girls.

392
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:53,420
- But not me.
- No.

393
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,810
- Really?
- Try me.

394
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,320
Well...

395
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:04,290
do you believe in God and Jesus
and everything still?

396
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,330
Yes. Do you?

397
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,830
Yes.

398
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:21,650
Have you ever gone all the way
with a girl?

399
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:30,620
No. Not quite.

400
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,600
Nowhere near it.

401
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:50,680
W-Would you like to?

402
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,150
- What, now?
- No!

403
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:59,510
lt wasn't an invitation.
lt was just a request for information.

404
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:06,150
The answer is yes, l would.

405
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:10,460
lf only it weren't a mortal sin.

406
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,670
What about you?

407
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,000
l don't know.

408
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:23,940
Sometimes it seems like such a strange
sort of thing to want to do.

409
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:28,950
Ridiculous. Like someone else putting
their finger up your nose or something.

410
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,580
Then again...

411
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:35,850
when you're dancing, say...

412
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,860
and it seems like the most--

413
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:42,330
God, l'm blushing.

414
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,630
l can't believe
l'm having this conversation.

415
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,070
Nor can l.

416
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,230
lt's great, isn't it?

417
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,910
Yes.

418
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,340
lt is.

419
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:09,890
Oh, dear.

420
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:13,550
l think this is going to be a problem.

421
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:17,790
Our bodies belong to Almighty God...

422
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:17,900
just as our souls
belong to Almighty God.

423
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,730
just as our souls
belong to Almighty God.

424
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,900
A young woman's body...

425
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:27,340
should be like her soul--

426
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,700
a garden for Jesus.

427
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:33,400
l speak now particularly...

428
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:37,540
to the girls and the young women
of this congregation.

429
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,010
Which is it to be?

430
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,280
Gardens for Jesus...

431
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:48,280
or vessels of sin?

432
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:54,900
The answer
you hold within yourselves.

433
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:57,400
l can't help thinking
it isn't fair...

434
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:00,440
throwing the whole responsibility
onto us like that.

435
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:03,030
Aidan says it's his job
to try to seduce me...

436
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,510
and it's my job
to try to stop him.

437
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,340
What do you think, Nan?

438
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:11,040
l think it's nonsense-- all of it.

439
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,880
The priests just make it up
to suit themselves.

440
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:17,080
- You don't really think that, do you?
- l do.

441
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:24,300
Those French-letter things boys wear
to stop girls getting pregnant--

442
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,060
why are they called that?

443
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:28,760
lt's the French.
They're always up to something.

444
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:01,290
You've done wonders.

445
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:10,030
Aidan came and helped.
Well, he did most of it, really.

446
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:13,410
He was great altogether.

447
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,310
You're going to live here?

448
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:21,580
ln the holidays, just. Tell you the
truth, l feel a bit strange about it.

449
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,920
Why is that?

450
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,150
My mother died here, having me.

451
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,760
Then after that, my father.

452
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,930
l was thinking we might have a party,
warm the place up a bit.

453
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,940
lt has electricity.
We could play records.

454
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:43,240
We could invite all the boys.

455
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,370
Were you thinking of anyone
in particular?

456
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:49,040
Not at all. Not me.

457
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,290
Ah, now, that was
absolutely delicious...

458
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,090
Mrs. Hogan.

459
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:09,230
l can't remember ever setting eyes
on a more succulent bird.

460
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,630
The richness of it and the flavor--

461
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,540
altogether indisputable.

462
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,040
Why, thank you.

463
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,100
That's very kind of you.

464
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,980
No, no, it's you who are kind.

465
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,980
Well, now...

466
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:26,780
we couldn't have you festering away
on your own every Sunday, could we?

467
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:30,250
Sure, you're practically
one of the family now, so you are.

468
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,380
lt gives me great pleasure
to hear you say that.

469
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:41,290
l thought we might take
a breath of fresh air later.

470
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:42,800
Why...

471
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:47,170
that would be very nice
for you both.

472
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,750
l've been having a long talk
with your father.

473
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:02,920
Oh, yes.

474
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,480
About the possibility
of a partnership.

475
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,630
l have to think of the future,
you see.

476
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,640
l have my way to make.

477
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,400
l have my life to live.

478
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,980
Yes, of course you have.

479
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:30,810
l hope it works out just great for you.
Really, l do.

480
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,280
Has your father spoken to you about it?

481
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:38,720
No. Why would he? lt's between
you and him. lt's nothing to do with me.

482
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:41,120
Ah, but it is, you see.

483
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,730
You know l'm great for you.

484
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:52,000
lf we were to marry-- l'm not talking
about now. l'm talking about the future.

485
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,570
Well...

486
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,580
that would tie things up just grand,
don't you think so?

487
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:07,480
You and l...

488
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:11,650
we could rub around very nicely.

489
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,690
You know that?

490
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:21,420
No, we wouldn't. l don't want
to hurt your feelings, but...

491
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,430
really, it's out of the question.

492
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,900
- You think l'm not good enough for you.
- l didn't say that.

493
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,410
Look.

494
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:37,210
lf you must know,
l'm in love with someone else.

495
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:43,050
And who is he...

496
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,610
this " someone else" ?

497
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,270
- lt's like the longhouse.
- What is?

498
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,040
This is.

499
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:11,170
You know,
in " The Sexual Life of Savages."

500
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:14,350
Except that in the Trobriand lslands...

501
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:17,910
the parties go on for six months
without stopping.

502
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:21,220
Six months of unfettered
sexual experimentation.

503
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,390
- lmagine that.
- lt's different for them.

504
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:28,370
The Trobriand lslanders aren't Catholic.
They don't have to go to confession.

505
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:30,370
- You're afraid of them.
- Anyway, l'm not sure...

506
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,370
you'd be up to six months
of unfettered sexual experimentation.

507
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,410
l wouldn't mind a crack at it.

508
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:14,800
Societies regulate
the conduct of their members...

509
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,140
in a variety of ways.

510
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:20,240
The rule of law
is the most obvious.

511
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:25,990
There are also
the time-honored weapons...

512
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:29,520
of shame and guilt.

513
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:34,890
The Trobriand lslanders
contrived to live very happily...

514
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:38,730
without recourse
to shame and guilt.

515
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,370
ln lreland...

516
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:43,970
as you know...

517
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,340
we have them both.

518
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:52,780
And fear, of course.

519
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:57,020
And fear.

520
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:04,820
No, Jack, please! We mustn't!

521
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,420
Please, not here, not now.

522
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:15,870
l know. lt's desperate.

523
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,930
Where then, and when?

524
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:23,340
l want you to take me
to a nice hotel.

525
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:26,710
When? l can't wait much longer for you.

526
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:28,800
You won't have to.

527
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,180
lt could be any night that suits you
from the 5th to the 10th.

528
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,130
All right, you win.

529
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:01,970
What do l have to do?

530
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,820
You have to hold it in your hand...

531
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:10,660
for 60 seconds.

532
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:18,160
All right. l'll hold it.

533
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:23,770
But l won't jiggle it, understand?

534
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,590
ls that all you're taking off?

535
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,090
What?

536
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:51,800
No, l was just, you know--

537
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,840
What are you doing?

538
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:05,740
l thought we should--

539
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:20,120
lt's my first time.

540
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:25,260
- You don't mind, do you?
- Not at all.

541
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:29,130
l never imagined.

542
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:35,440
l wanted to save it
for someone really special.

543
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:47,650
Those Westwards who have the big estate
above Knockglen?

544
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:52,420
Well, now. You see?

545
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,790
What? You and him?

546
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:59,700
- Who do you think you are?
- Would you shut your hole...

547
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,530
you stupid article?

548
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:05,770
And you.

549
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,010
Will you bring him home to see us?

550
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,340
Yeah, right.

551
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:19,210
l don't think that would be
a very good idea.

552
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:31,130
The honorable Lavinia Ashmore...

553
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:35,000
only daughter
of Lord and Lady William Ashmore.

554
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:38,200
She's 28 years old.
She won't be too particular.

555
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:41,540
Judging from her photograph,
her husband won't have to be either.

556
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,510
Miss Phillida Foote-Crampe...

557
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:47,440
of Selly Oak.

558
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:50,040
Family owns a chain of slaughterhouses.

559
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,550
Very well off.

560
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,150
Miss Candida Cruise.

561
00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:00,390
Looks like a sack of potatoes
on horseback, but her father...

562
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:03,690
made a million in gravel,
l think it was.

563
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,660
Miss Olivia Bacon-Batche.

564
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:17,070
- To England?
- lt's only a week.

565
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:19,470
We play four matches.

566
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:22,140
l wish you could come
and lend moral support.

567
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:24,480
lmmoral support
would be even more welcome.

568
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:25,980
Don't.

569
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:31,850
l could buy you
some of those French letters.

570
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,620
You know they sell them
over the counter there.

571
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:39,190
Just like that.
Just walk in the shop and ask for them.

572
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:40,700
Right out loud.

573
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:43,130
Nobody turns a hair.

574
00:50:45,770 --> 00:50:47,360
lsn't that amazing?

575
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:51,540
Will l get a few packets then?

576
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:20,430
- We won't be seen, will we?
- No, it's all right.

577
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:23,410
No one comes up here,
just the nuns from the convent...

578
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,070
and they're all locked up
by 7:00 in the evening.

579
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,020
What did you say to Eve?

580
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:38,420
Of course you didn't mention me.

581
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:42,720
l didn't ask Eve at all.
l don't think Eve would understand.

582
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:06,610
You might be interested in this.

583
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:09,120
l picked it up last year
when l was over in London.

584
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:14,420
"The Art of Married Love,"
by Van der Kant.

585
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:18,690
He's a Dutchman, but he's
a fully qualified medical consultant.

586
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,200
Look.

587
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:23,830
l was wondering if we might try...

588
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,270
something like...

589
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:28,970
that.

590
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:32,900
Would you like to?

591
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,980
Well, l think l would, yes.

592
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,110
Only if you would.

593
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:35,200
Who is that little chap?

594
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:37,670
lt's called the lnfant of Prague.

595
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:43,610
Prague. God, you're so strange,
you people.

596
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:46,020
Don't say that.

597
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:50,450
- What?
- Don't say, " you people."

598
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:52,890
l'm not like them. l'm like you.

599
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,950
Sorry. l simply meant--

600
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:57,930
l'm like you. l'm not like them.

601
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:02,290
We're nothing to do
with all that nonsense, are we?

602
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,490
l'm like you, aren't l?

603
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,210
Yes, in a very important way.

604
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,840
The most important way.

605
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:16,210
Yes, perhaps.

606
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,550
Well, now, ladies and gentlemen...

607
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:02,250
not so often we see one of these.

608
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:05,320
Would anybody like to hazard a guess
about the cause of death?

609
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,670
Tertiary syphilis.

610
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:14,670
"l can't understand it, Doctor.
l had a few open sores...

611
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:17,300
but they seemed to go away
of their own accord."

612
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:20,810
That was the first stage, of course.
Later stages attack...

613
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,110
bodily tissue.

614
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:25,310
You see here?
lt's almost completely gone.

615
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:27,820
By this time...

616
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:31,190
he'll also have
extensive suffering of the brain.

617
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:33,720
lf you'll bear with me
for a few moments...

618
00:55:33,790 --> 00:55:36,350
we'll just saw
the poor fellow's head open.

619
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:38,290
l'll show you what l mean.

620
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:49,570
lt's all right. l'll be fine.

621
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:53,770
lt's just--
l hate that anatomy stuff.

622
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,870
Why don't you tell your father
you want to give up the course?

623
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:58,380
l couldn't.

624
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:01,680
He never says anything about it...

625
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:05,250
but l know it would break his heart
if l gave it up.

626
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,350
Sure, l can do it.

627
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:10,690
l have to do it.
l have to get something right.

628
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:19,370
This is lovely.

629
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,370
lt is.

630
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:25,170
You shouldn't have, though,
with all that study to do.

631
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,180
l wanted to give you a break.

632
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:30,400
And?

633
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:34,110
l wanted to talk to you...

634
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:37,810
about maybe staying in Dublin
during term time.

635
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:41,320
Week nights only.

636
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:45,260
l suppose it can't be much fun
for you around here.

637
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:48,630
Oh, Daddy, l didn't mean that...

638
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:51,070
but l would like to see
more of my friends...

639
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:54,200
and l hate having to get the bus
no matter what.

640
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:57,900
Have you any particular friends in mind?

641
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:59,410
Yes.

642
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:03,370
Jack.
l love him.

643
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:11,560
You went to university to study,
not to fall in love.

644
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,860
Now, if he's a good boy...

645
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:18,950
if he's worth having,
he'll be patient.

646
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:21,460
He'll wait for you.

647
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:26,860
Your mother's right.
He'll wait...

648
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:29,370
if he's the right sort.

649
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,810
Like Sean bloody Walsh.

650
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:36,080
Patiently wheedling himself
into a share of the business.

651
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:38,740
Patiently creeping around me, hoping
he'll wear me down and l'll marry him.

652
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:40,750
Then he'll get the house and everything.

653
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:44,250
l don't know why
you let me go to university.

654
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:47,120
lt's like taking me to a mountaintop
and showing me the world...

655
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:49,890
and then marching me back down, saying,
"That's what you can't have...

656
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:52,090
you silly, great, fat article.

657
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:55,560
This is what you can have:
Knockglen for the rest of your life...

658
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:58,120
and married to Sean bloody Walsh!"

659
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,760
l'd rather be married
to a bloody lizard!

660
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,900
Don't you ever...

661
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,470
ever...

662
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:14,640
talk to your mother or me
like that again.

663
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,150
l've enough--

664
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:23,490
lsn't it enough that
we worry sick about the business...

665
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,500
without having to listen to this--

666
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:28,660
That's my dinner done.

667
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,440
l couldn't eat another bite!

668
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:48,740
Quiet again?

669
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:51,520
Yes.

670
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,900
l'm not feeling the best today.

671
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:10,260
l think, if it's all right with you,
l'll go home early.

672
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:13,870
You leave it to me.
l have everything under control.

673
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:15,380
Yes.

674
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,150
That's it.

675
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:22,720
Well.

676
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,030
Thank you, Walter.

677
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:32,660
Who's that girl?
She looks like a film star.

678
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:36,160
That's Nan Mahon.
Mahon's, the builders.

679
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:38,160
They were in Knockglen
when Nan was small.

680
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:41,860
lt's a great mark of respect
to Mr. Hogan--

681
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:44,420
so many Dublin folk here.

682
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,600
lt's altogether very gratifying.

683
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:49,130
Nan Mahon, did you say?

684
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:52,700
Yes. Why do you ask?
You don't know her, do you?

685
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:55,570
No.

686
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:58,910
l couldn't say l know her,
Miss Malone.

687
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:02,320
l just have the feeling
l've seen her somewhere before.

688
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:06,880
l think she's a friend
of our fine Mr. Westward.

689
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:18,960
- How are you getting on in Dublin?
- Are you enjoying college life, dear?

690
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,160
Yeah. Everyone likes it.

691
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:31,880
l feel so awful.

692
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:36,410
Almost the last thing l did was yell
and carry on at him like a big fishwife.

693
01:01:36,490 --> 01:01:38,110
Come on.

694
01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:40,420
l never knew such a good girl
to her parents.

695
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:44,890
lt's so hard.

696
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,960
He loved me so much, you know?

697
01:01:49,930 --> 01:01:51,870
He was always giving me things...

698
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:55,240
but they were always the wrong things.

699
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:58,480
l kept thinking, " Daddy...

700
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:03,710
couldn't you just get one thing right
in your life, just for once?"

701
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:07,340
You see?

702
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:10,080
l was always a nasty,
ungrateful girl in my heart.

703
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,780
And now he's dead.

704
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:21,600
l'm sorry. l'll stop now.

705
01:02:23,330 --> 01:02:25,270
lt's always that way.

706
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,570
All parents are the same.

707
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:32,800
Really what they want
is for you to be like them.

708
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:42,210
l'll have to stay home and look after
my mother and the shop and everything.

709
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:43,910
She's collapsed entirely.

710
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:49,750
l won't be able to see you.
lt'll be weeks and weeks.

711
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:51,760
You can't come to Dublin at all?

712
01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:55,930
Not for a while.
l'll be in the shop every day.

713
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,770
Mother's not fit to be left.
lt has to be done.

714
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:04,070
- lt's only for a while.
- l know.

715
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:09,000
l don't see why business
has been so bad.

716
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:11,010
Custom hasn't fallen away that much...

717
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,410
so why are the receipts so low?

718
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:16,000
Ah, now, this would be
the double entry system.

719
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:20,280
lt isn't everyone
can grasp it right away.

720
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:34,520
Have you talked to Mr. Duggan
at all yet...

721
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:36,900
about your father's wishes
for the future of the business?

722
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:40,860
Tomorrow, Sean.

723
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:42,370
That's good.

724
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:46,870
lt will be great to have everything
cut and dried...

725
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:48,380
won't it?

726
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:54,280
Then we can see our way ahead.

727
01:04:54,350 --> 01:04:57,790
Shouldn't the weekly takings
correspond to the figures...

728
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:59,910
in the bank lodgement book here?

729
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:02,320
Approximately, yes,
give or take the drawings.

730
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:03,720
The drawings?

731
01:05:03,790 --> 01:05:06,730
Whatever your father withdrew
from the till in cash.

732
01:05:07,630 --> 01:05:11,120
For petrol, as it might be.

733
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:19,670
Or perhaps to buy you
a lovely costume...

734
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:22,910
such as the one you're wearing
at the moment.

735
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:38,250
Oh, dear, Mr. Duggan.

736
01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:41,460
lt's the most awful quandary.
l don't know what to do for the best.

737
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:44,020
lf you've any doubt about Mr. Walsh
or the partnership...

738
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:46,040
l urge you to think very carefully.

739
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:49,440
Legally, you may do as you wish.
Don't rush into anything.

740
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:51,200
We won't. Thanks.

741
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,510
Take care now.

742
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:55,510
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

743
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:09,490
l don't think you should let Sean Walsh
get one sniff of the partnership.

744
01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:13,900
But if it's what your father wanted--

745
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:16,830
He was always saying he wished
he could pay Sean more.

746
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:20,340
There was no need for that if
he was helping himself out of the till.

747
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,840
Quiet.

748
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:26,870
l won't believe that of Sean.

749
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:30,350
He's always been so good...

750
01:06:30,410 --> 01:06:35,350
and he hasn't spent ten pence on himself
in the ten years he's been in Knockglen.

751
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:37,580
That's true.

752
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:40,090
l wonder what
he's done with it all, Mother.

753
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:42,790
l just know he's not right.

754
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:44,790
That is enough.

755
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:57,370
Poor Jack. He is missing you,
but he hasn't a chance to be bad.

756
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,380
We don't let him out of our sight.

757
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:02,310
We made him go to the pictures with us,
Nanny and Aidan.

758
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:07,680
- And he cried.
- No. Did he?

759
01:07:10,790 --> 01:07:13,690
God, l do miss him.

760
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:16,350
l went to see Mother Francis
at the convent.

761
01:07:16,430 --> 01:07:19,330
Do you know what she said? Someone's
getting into the cottage at night.

762
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:20,660
Who?

763
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:22,530
l don't believe it.

764
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:26,200
Someone thought they saw a light
and smoke coming from the chimney.

765
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:29,030
Haunted, maybe.

766
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:32,870
Ah, no. Ghosts are a bit classy
for Knockglen.

767
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:34,570
Secret lovers.

768
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:40,880
All right, l cannot tell a lie.
lt was me and Sean Walsh from the shop.

769
01:07:40,950 --> 01:07:42,210
Oh, God!

770
01:07:42,290 --> 01:07:43,750
He's like a lizard!

771
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:45,810
How do you think lizards make love?

772
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:48,090
l'll show you.

773
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:00,240
That will be one-eleven.

774
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:02,570
lf he doesn't like it,
tell him we'll find one to suit him.

775
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:05,200
- That's very good of you. Thank you.
- Good-bye now.

776
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:15,580
You're getting into the way of it fine.

777
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:17,280
l'm glad you think so.

778
01:08:30,670 --> 01:08:33,470
There's a good film
coming to the Palladium this Friday.

779
01:08:37,470 --> 01:08:40,600
"Rebel Without A Cause."

780
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:43,250
How many times must l tell you not to
wear that green apron day in, day out?

781
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:47,310
How many times must l tell you not to
wear that green apron day in, day out?

782
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:51,050
l feel like l'm living
in an institution!

783
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:53,060
Nasey, you dirty-looking idiot.

784
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:56,390
Now look what you have to do.
lf you don't wipe that grin...

785
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:58,760
off your face, l'll knock it off.

786
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:16,340
Christ, this is awful.

787
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,540
- Quite sure?
- Yes.

788
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:24,110
l'm two months gone.
Got the result this morning.

789
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:29,190
God moves in a mysterious way,
l suppose.

790
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:32,960
Christ, this is terrible.

791
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:35,360
lt doesn't have to be, does it?

792
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:41,870
No, you're right.

793
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:45,780
God, you're really something.

794
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:48,680
You're a wonderful girl.
l've never known anybody like you.

795
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:50,180
Good.

796
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,180
l really never thought it could happen.

797
01:09:54,250 --> 01:09:56,190
No one ever does.

798
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:59,310
My poor darling.

799
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:02,880
l'll take care of you.
lt's not the end of the world.

800
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:07,820
Listen. l had all this
from a very close friend.

801
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:10,800
lt's someone you've met,
but it wouldn't do to name names.

802
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:13,030
She said there's nothing to it at all.

803
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:16,870
lt's in England, of course,
but it's all for the best.

804
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:20,030
You mustn't worry about money.

805
01:10:20,110 --> 01:10:22,540
l'll cover all your expenses.

806
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:26,550
You want me to get rid of it.

807
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:28,310
Of course. What else?

808
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:33,360
l thought we would be married.

809
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:37,860
That's out of the question.

810
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:41,200
l thought you loved me.

811
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:44,600
You kept telling me you loved me.

812
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:49,230
Well, l did.
l mean, l do, insofar as--

813
01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:54,600
You must have realized.
l have to marry for money.

814
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:57,910
We lose the house;
the whole family goes down.

815
01:10:57,980 --> 01:11:01,750
Can't afford to marry you now,
however much l'd want to.

816
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:06,660
No, l hadn't realized that.

817
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:11,680
lt was very silly and naive of me.
l see that now.

818
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:18,030
l can't take that.

819
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:23,200
l'm a Catholic. l can't help it.
l couldn't kill my baby.

820
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:25,210
Jesus, you people!

821
01:11:26,710 --> 01:11:28,470
Take it anyway.

822
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:32,650
Guilt money.

823
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:36,450
Will it bounce?

824
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,030
Good-bye.

825
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:57,000
lt was lovely.

826
01:11:58,240 --> 01:11:59,680
l know.

827
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:04,340
You're a really shitty article.
You know that, don't you?

828
01:12:14,590 --> 01:12:18,650
- You going to be in for your tea?
- No, ma'am.

829
01:12:18,730 --> 01:12:20,160
l'm going out.

830
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:32,140
- Like a drink?
- Maybe later, Bill.

831
01:12:32,210 --> 01:12:34,140
l'm looking for someone.

832
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:56,630
Hello, stranger.

833
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:59,130
Nan! What are you doing here?

834
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:02,470
l was looking for Eve and Aidan,
but it doesn't matter.

835
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:04,130
l found you instead.

836
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:09,250
l don't think l've ever seen you
on your own before.

837
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,680
Ah, well.

838
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:14,880
l thought tonight
was the Rugby Club social.

839
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:16,390
That's just it.

840
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:20,550
l was trying to get Benny to come,
but she couldn't...

841
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:22,060
or wouldn't.

842
01:13:23,890 --> 01:13:26,520
You'd think if she cared enough,
she'd manage something.

843
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:30,730
Her mother won't fall apart if she's
left alone the odd night, will she?

844
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:34,100
Or am l being unfair?

845
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:39,040
l think she feels
she's all her mother has now...

846
01:13:39,110 --> 01:13:40,700
being an only child.

847
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:42,710
lt's a shame, though.

848
01:13:45,850 --> 01:13:47,440
Why don't l come with you?

849
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,750
Would that be nice?

850
01:13:54,990 --> 01:13:56,430
Yeah.

851
01:13:57,660 --> 01:13:59,650
All right.

852
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:05,560
lt, uh, can get a bit rough.

853
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:10,140
You'd look after me, wouldn't you?
l feel safe with you.

854
01:14:11,210 --> 01:14:14,270
Come on. lt'd be great.
We can cheer each other up.

855
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:22,070
What are we doing?

856
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:24,740
Make me warm.

857
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:26,410
Feel me.

858
01:15:46,970 --> 01:15:48,670
Oh, God, Nan.

859
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:52,400
l never meant anything
like that to happen.

860
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:55,880
Don't blame yourself.

861
01:15:55,950 --> 01:15:58,780
lt was my fault
as much as yours.

862
01:15:58,850 --> 01:16:00,910
We just got carried away.

863
01:16:02,290 --> 01:16:04,720
lt's nothing to do
with you and Benny.

864
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:09,620
No one knows except us,
and we need never tell anyone.

865
01:16:11,290 --> 01:16:13,730
And it needn't ever happen again.

866
01:16:17,230 --> 01:16:19,330
But it was lovely, Jack.

867
01:16:34,850 --> 01:16:38,480
No, it was nothing in particular.

868
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:42,220
l'm sorry to have bothered you.
Could you just tell him l called?

869
01:16:42,290 --> 01:16:45,130
Of course l will, Bernadette.

870
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:48,690
How are things going, dear?
Are you still stuck in the shop?

871
01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:51,200
How's your mother now?

872
01:16:55,770 --> 01:16:57,210
We're thinking of her.

873
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,480
Thanks. Bye.

874
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:16,290
So, when we've made a sale,
we put a little tick...

875
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:20,020
here at the back,
and it's against the stock register.

876
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:23,230
That's it, Mrs. Hogan.
You've got it in one.

877
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:56,730
Jack? l can start coming
to lectures again.

878
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:00,200
Mother's so much better,
she's going to take over in the shop.

879
01:18:00,270 --> 01:18:04,070
And Eve's going to have another party,
so l hope you come to that.

880
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:08,580
You know, l've been having
a bit of a brood about you and me.

881
01:18:10,410 --> 01:18:13,470
l think l've changed
my mind about something.

882
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:17,080
l can't say it over the phone,
but l think you'll like it.

883
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:20,950
l haven't let you get a word in
edgewise. Will l see you tomorrow then?

884
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:23,850
Where will we meet?

885
01:18:24,930 --> 01:18:27,330
l'll meet the bus.

886
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:31,230
Benny, there's something
l have to tell you too.

887
01:18:51,990 --> 01:18:53,680
What's the matter?

888
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,280
Let's get out of here.

889
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:09,000
lt's Nan.

890
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:13,270
- She's pregnant.
- Oh, God.

891
01:19:14,410 --> 01:19:15,840
Poor Nan.

892
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:20,610
- ls she very upset?
- She's out of her mind with worry.

893
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:24,520
lsn't that amazing?

894
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:27,180
She's the last one
l would have thought of.

895
01:19:28,790 --> 01:19:31,520
Do you know who the boy is?

896
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,990
The baby's mine.

897
01:19:39,070 --> 01:19:41,000
We're getting married.

898
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:02,850
lt's all my fault.

899
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:04,690
Your fault?

900
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:07,530
Because he wanted me
to do it with him.

901
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:10,570
And l wanted to as well so much.

902
01:20:10,630 --> 01:20:13,160
And we so nearly did,
lots of times.

903
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:18,270
lf we had done it,
it'd be me having his baby and not Nan.

904
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:24,000
l don't care what the priests say!
We should do what we feel!

905
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:28,040
Like Jack, you mean.
He certainly pleased himself, didn't he?

906
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:32,050
No, he loves me. He told me.
He doesn't love her.

907
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:34,250
He's going to marry her
because of the baby.

908
01:20:36,260 --> 01:20:39,520
- Poor Jack.
- Benny, for God's sake!

909
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:43,160
He was your boyfriend!
She was your friend!

910
01:20:43,230 --> 01:20:45,220
Why couldn't they just
leave each other alone?

911
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:47,100
l don't know.

912
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:49,560
They don't know.

913
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:55,370
lt's not like them.
lt's not like either of them.

914
01:20:56,450 --> 01:20:58,380
Maybe someone
put something in the drinks.

915
01:20:58,450 --> 01:21:01,250
Benny, will you grow up?

916
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:03,720
l'm never going to speak
to Jack Foley again...

917
01:21:03,790 --> 01:21:06,220
and if she comes anywhere near me,
l'll kill her!

918
01:21:06,290 --> 01:21:07,950
l mean it.

919
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,190
What am l going to do?

920
01:21:19,870 --> 01:21:22,840
l'll tell you one thing
you're going to do.

921
01:21:22,910 --> 01:21:27,140
Show a brave face. Never let them
see how much they've hurt you.

922
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,340
lt's a bit late for that now.

923
01:21:35,450 --> 01:21:37,250
All right.

924
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:38,910
l'll try.

925
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,240
Here's to the happy couple.

926
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:21,420
"Wicklow man entices
neighbor's ferret."

927
01:22:27,170 --> 01:22:29,100
- Aidan.
- What?

928
01:22:29,170 --> 01:22:30,940
Someone has been
using the cottage.

929
01:22:35,780 --> 01:22:37,840
They used this
to light the fire.

930
01:22:37,910 --> 01:22:39,850
lt's dated March the fourth.

931
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:43,010
l haven't lit a fire in here
since February.

932
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:49,950
They were very neat.

933
01:22:50,030 --> 01:22:52,550
Well, they didn't break in.

934
01:22:54,730 --> 01:22:56,320
They must've found the key.

935
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:59,100
They just used it, l suppose.

936
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,400
This is a mistake.

937
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:37,960
lt'll be fun. Believe me.

938
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:41,600
You're the star, Jack.
Anything you do is fine by them.

939
01:24:09,570 --> 01:24:12,130
- Hello, Benny.
- Hello.

940
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:17,040
How's your mother?
How's the shop?

941
01:24:18,110 --> 01:24:20,050
Fine, thank you.

942
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:32,320
So, how are you?

943
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:38,190
- Are you all right?
- l'm fine.

944
01:24:40,740 --> 01:24:43,170
l didn't think you were coming.

945
01:24:44,770 --> 01:24:47,110
lt's a bit sudden.

946
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:49,110
lt seems a bit too soon.

947
01:24:50,450 --> 01:24:51,880
Don't worry.

948
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:54,340
l'm fine.

949
01:25:01,690 --> 01:25:04,490
- Where is Eve?
- She's in the kitchen.

950
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:17,870
Didn't think you had the nerve, Nan.

951
01:25:17,940 --> 01:25:20,030
Brought you a present, Eve.

952
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:30,580
That's gonna make
everything all right, is it?

953
01:25:31,650 --> 01:25:33,920
l just thought you'd like it...

954
01:25:33,990 --> 01:25:36,290
as a jug or to put flowers in.

955
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:44,830
l always thought there should
be one here, but l never--

956
01:25:48,070 --> 01:25:49,000
When?

957
01:25:50,470 --> 01:25:52,810
When did you think that?

958
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:53,970
What?

959
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:57,070
That old newspaper in the grate.

960
01:25:58,150 --> 01:25:59,840
lt was you.

961
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:02,750
You came to my cottage.

962
01:26:03,850 --> 01:26:06,120
- Wait.
- No, you wait!

963
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:11,620
l knew it wasn't haunted.
l knew someone had been here.

964
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:14,330
lt was you.

965
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:18,490
And long before Jack.
Oh, God, l see it all now.

966
01:26:18,570 --> 01:26:21,370
- Eve, please.
- Will you tell Jack or will l?

967
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:24,630
- Tell him what?
- lt was you, wasn't it?

968
01:26:24,710 --> 01:26:26,640
lt was you here...

969
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:31,610
with Simon Westward, wasn't it?

970
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:35,450
That's what Sean Walsh
was talking about at the funeral.

971
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,890
He saw you and Westward here.

972
01:26:40,790 --> 01:26:43,620
That's his baby
you're carrying, isn't it?

973
01:26:43,690 --> 01:26:46,590
Anyone could've told you
that cold fish wouldn't marry you.

974
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:49,890
So you had to go and steal Jack
from your best friend!

975
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:55,130
You don't know what
you've done, do you?

976
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:58,830
You've broken Benny's heart!
l wish l could hurt you!

977
01:26:58,910 --> 01:27:02,500
- Take it easy!
- l will not take it easy!

978
01:27:02,580 --> 01:27:04,980
She's mad! Jack!

979
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:10,250
l think somebody's hurt.

980
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:12,250
lt's all right, Nan.

981
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:15,850
- ls she bad?
- lt's all right.

982
01:27:20,430 --> 01:27:22,730
lt's all right.
He's looking after her.

983
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:30,570
Here, Jack.

984
01:27:32,510 --> 01:27:35,240
- Look at her arm.
- Get her up.

985
01:27:35,310 --> 01:27:38,110
lt's all right, Nan.
Oh, Jesus.

986
01:27:39,450 --> 01:27:41,640
Let's get her to a hospital.

987
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:41,370
Do you see anything you like, madam?

988
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:45,240
No, go ahead.
Have a good look.

989
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:49,510
You must be dying for it...

990
01:29:49,580 --> 01:29:53,540
now your fellow's decided
he'd rather diddle your best friend.

991
01:30:09,430 --> 01:30:11,760
The time and the place.

992
01:30:11,830 --> 01:30:14,270
l think you've
kept me waiting long enough.

993
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:17,570
- Sean, don't be stupid.
- l'm not the stupid one.

994
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:23,610
Don't you know
this was meant to happen?

995
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:29,240
My mistake was
being too patient.

996
01:30:31,090 --> 01:30:33,780
Sure, l'm doing you a favor.

997
01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:36,350
There's not many men
would take you on at all.

998
01:30:40,330 --> 01:30:42,760
But l've always had
an eye for you, Benny.

999
01:30:53,310 --> 01:30:54,740
Take your clothes off.

1000
01:30:56,450 --> 01:30:57,940
lt's all right.

1001
01:30:58,010 --> 01:31:02,470
l've locked the front door.
No one's going to interrupt us.

1002
01:31:05,050 --> 01:31:06,250
Come on.

1003
01:31:09,490 --> 01:31:11,080
Don't be shy.

1004
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:16,900
- l will if you will.
- Are you mad?

1005
01:31:16,970 --> 01:31:19,230
Take your clothes off now!

1006
01:31:26,210 --> 01:31:28,010
Get off!

1007
01:31:30,250 --> 01:31:31,680
Get off me!

1008
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:47,930
Ah, Jesus!

1009
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,930
What are these, Sean?

1010
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:55,870
This would be
your double-entry bookkeeping, would it?

1011
01:31:55,940 --> 01:31:59,000
l was owed that money, Benny,
every penny.

1012
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:01,440
What your father paid me
wouldn't keep a rat.

1013
01:32:01,510 --> 01:32:04,780
He trusted you,
and you robbed him blind!

1014
01:32:04,850 --> 01:32:07,650
l never spent a penny of it.
l was saving it for us.

1015
01:32:08,850 --> 01:32:12,510
How dare you! Get out of here
before l call the guard!

1016
01:32:15,490 --> 01:32:17,930
l would've married you, Benny...

1017
01:32:20,260 --> 01:32:23,530
and there's not many would say that,
fat cow that you are...

1018
01:32:25,970 --> 01:32:29,800
even though l'm worth ten of you
and all your family put together.

1019
01:32:34,780 --> 01:32:36,210
l wouldn't touch you now.

1020
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:43,410
Give me a hundred
and we'll call it quits.

1021
01:32:45,620 --> 01:32:47,490
Take it.

1022
01:33:18,120 --> 01:33:21,110
All the remaining passengers
for England, please go to gate two.

1023
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:23,620
You shouldn't have come.

1024
01:33:25,060 --> 01:33:28,120
l'm glad you did, but it's
nothing to do with you anymore.

1025
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:30,890
l hate to see you
leaving like this.

1026
01:33:30,970 --> 01:33:32,400
Look at the state you're in.

1027
01:33:32,470 --> 01:33:34,400
We women are tougher
than we look.

1028
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:38,030
l'm sorry, Jack.

1029
01:33:38,110 --> 01:33:41,300
l was a bit desperate, you see.

1030
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:44,570
All passengers for England,
please board the ship now.

1031
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:49,180
Give my love to Benny.

1032
01:34:18,350 --> 01:34:20,780
Will you go in the back,
please, Mother?

1033
01:34:30,790 --> 01:34:32,730
Yes, sir.
Can l help you?

1034
01:34:35,030 --> 01:34:36,830
Look, Benny.

1035
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:39,990
l know l've no right
to expect anything of you.

1036
01:34:40,070 --> 01:34:41,500
You haven't.

1037
01:34:42,770 --> 01:34:44,210
l want you to know--

1038
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:50,440
- lt was that thing with Nan.
- l don't want to know about it.

1039
01:34:50,510 --> 01:34:51,950
l mean stopping the bleeding.

1040
01:34:52,010 --> 01:34:56,780
When l realized l was saving her life,
that she could have died...

1041
01:34:56,850 --> 01:35:00,450
all l could think was
how grateful l was that l could do it.

1042
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:03,820
l wasn't faint or sick.
l was fine.

1043
01:35:04,930 --> 01:35:08,590
l knew right then that that was what
l wanted to do for the rest of my life.

1044
01:35:11,270 --> 01:35:13,960
Well, l'm very glad for you.

1045
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:16,830
The other thing is...

1046
01:35:16,910 --> 01:35:18,340
l love you.

1047
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:24,800
l never loved her.

1048
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:26,810
You know that.

1049
01:35:31,420 --> 01:35:33,950
And if you'll have me...

1050
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:35,960
l want to marry you.

1051
01:35:37,060 --> 01:35:38,650
Benny, you're the one.

1052
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:42,360
l couldn't love anyone else.

1053
01:35:44,430 --> 01:35:45,700
Marry me?

1054
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:49,370
- Yes.
- And...

1055
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:51,100
why would l want to do that?

1056
01:35:53,910 --> 01:35:56,810
l suppose l have ruined things.

1057
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:58,810
Benny, l'm sorry.

1058
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:02,950
l want to make it up to you.

1059
01:36:03,020 --> 01:36:05,150
l will, if you'll let me.

1060
01:36:07,460 --> 01:36:09,220
Do you think
you could love me again?

1061
01:36:12,030 --> 01:36:14,550
No. l don't think l could.

1062
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:22,700
Yeah, that's a lie.

1063
01:36:23,770 --> 01:36:28,400
l could love you again,
but l'm not sure that l want to.

1064
01:36:36,850 --> 01:36:38,910
You broke my heart...

1065
01:36:38,990 --> 01:36:42,360
and l'm not the same person
that l was, now.

1066
01:36:42,420 --> 01:36:44,980
So if you're serious...

1067
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:49,860
you'd have to get to know me
as l am now, and...

1068
01:36:49,930 --> 01:36:52,700
l'd have to get to know you
as you are now.

1069
01:36:54,970 --> 01:36:57,060
And then we'll just see.

1070
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:09,420
Jack was telling the truth.

1071
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:14,120
Over the next year, he pursued
his medical studies like a demon.

1072
01:37:14,190 --> 01:37:16,920
He also pursued me.

1073
01:37:16,990 --> 01:37:20,390
l moved to Dublin in the autumn
to share a flat with Eve...

1074
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:22,620
and at the university, my paper...

1075
01:37:22,700 --> 01:37:26,190
comparing the lrish Catholic mating
rites with the Trobriand lslanders...

1076
01:37:26,270 --> 01:37:28,200
caused quite a stir...

1077
01:37:28,270 --> 01:37:31,400
and it pointed me towards
my future career as a writer.

1078
01:37:32,470 --> 01:37:34,030
And slowly...

1079
01:37:34,110 --> 01:37:37,140
as Jack and l spent
more and more time together...

1080
01:37:37,210 --> 01:37:40,240
l suppose l fell in love
with him again.

1081
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:47,220
One afternoon, we found ourselves
back at Eve's cottage.

1082
01:37:49,990 --> 01:37:53,090
- What are we doing here?
- Come on.

1083
01:38:05,010 --> 01:38:08,770
Bless me, Father,
for l have sinned.
