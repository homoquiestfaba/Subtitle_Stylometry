that happened to me
the other day.

9

I went to the post office
to get some stamps,

10
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:54,090
and I waited my usual
three hours in line.

11

And just as I was getting
to the window,

12
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:02,599
an announcement was made that
if anyone just needed stamps,

13
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,601
to move into a different line.

14
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:08,104
So I moved into
the different line,

15
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:11,107
and this giant boot
came down from the ceiling...

16
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,110
and stamped me on the head.

what would make the best pet.

22
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,387
And he suggested a turtle.

23
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:46,392
So I bought a turtle
and got a nice little bowl...
for him to live in...

24
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:50,346
with some plants and a bridge
for him to walk on.

come out of his shell.

I was so depressed,

1336
01:39:37,004 --> 01:39:39,890
I thought I would join
the military.

1337
01:39:39,890 --> 01:39:43,761
But I failed the physical.

1338
01:39:43,761 --> 01:39:45,763
Can you imagine?

1339
01:39:45,763 --> 01:39:49,733
Me, not being allowed
to join the army.

1340
01:39:49,733 --> 01:39:52,736
