1
00:02:15,418 --> 00:02:17,852
ln July 1937

2
00:02:18,321 --> 00:02:21,290
Japan started
the Marco Polo Bridge lncident

3
00:02:21,825 --> 00:02:24,555
Beijing and Tianjin fell
one after another. Huabei was in danger

4
00:02:25,028 --> 00:02:28,896
The Chinese nation's existence
was at stake

5
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:32,795
For the whole nation's interests

6
00:02:32,836 --> 00:02:35,737
CPC joined hands with KMT once again

7
00:02:36,172 --> 00:02:41,200
Red Army was recomposed into
KMT's 8th Route Army

8
00:02:42,212 --> 00:02:44,112
Following the order of

9
00:02:44,147 --> 00:02:46,615
CPC's Central Military Commission

10
00:02:46,649 --> 00:02:49,447
l crossed the Yellow River
and rushed day and night

11
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:51,885
for the frontline against Japan

12
00:03:24,187 --> 00:03:30,353
Between Henan and Hebei
is the Yellow River

13
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:38,191
while between Shandong and Shanxi
is Mt. Taihang

14
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:43,504
After we marched through Shanhaiguan
from Manchuria

15
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:47,134
the vast North China Plain
is right in front of us

16
00:03:48,177 --> 00:03:50,611
As the Chinese saying goes

17
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:57,883
He who has conquered Taihang
will be invincible

18
00:03:58,755 --> 00:04:03,249
Shanxi is right between
Mt. Taihang and the Yellow River

19
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:06,456
The goal for this army is to

20
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:12,731
capture northern China via Shanxi

21
00:04:13,036 --> 00:04:16,802
How come the area and shape of Shanxi

22
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,774
are so much like those of Japan?

23
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,605
lt is more like the spine of China

24
00:04:21,744 --> 00:04:37,354
Seizing Taihang is like
breaking the back of the Chinese

25
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:47,868
Chiang calls for
'resistance by burning the land'

26
00:04:47,904 --> 00:04:51,032
Yours must be more meaningful

27
00:04:52,642 --> 00:04:56,305
lf the land is burnt
what is there to fight for?

28
00:04:57,847 --> 00:05:00,907
Defending the land is our main goal

29
00:05:02,418 --> 00:05:07,355
Resistance is just
a way of achieving the goal

30
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:10,725
Excellent...

31
00:05:12,996 --> 00:05:15,089
Sir, Zhu De is here

32
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:16,991
My uniform

33
00:05:21,604 --> 00:05:24,072
My friend

34
00:05:25,608 --> 00:05:26,836
Your Excellency Commander Yan

35
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:29,868
Zhu De is here to report for duty

36
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,680
By no means...

37
00:05:34,317 --> 00:05:35,682
Please...

38
00:05:35,718 --> 00:05:36,844
Please...

39
00:05:38,054 --> 00:05:41,023
As your Party's declaration said

40
00:05:41,057 --> 00:05:45,289
the whole Chinese nation
is being endangered

41
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:49,697
We've been anxiously
waiting for your coming

42
00:05:49,732 --> 00:05:53,224
l'm sorry to say that
we're poorly equipped

43
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:57,535
We may not be of much help
to the war situation

44
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:01,674
Help yourself...

45
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:03,743
Get tea ready

46
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:15,019
But all my soldiers
vow to fight together with you

47
00:06:15,558 --> 00:06:17,025
Resistance by defending the land

48
00:06:17,894 --> 00:06:20,419
l hereby officially confirm to you that

49
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:24,126
CPC has made the resolution to

50
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:27,068
launch a campaign against the Japanese

51
00:06:27,437 --> 00:06:28,836
Please give your comment

52
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:34,102
Pingxingguan is ideal for
setting an ambush

53
00:06:34,677 --> 00:06:38,135
lt's the only route for
ltagaki troops to enter Shanxi

54
00:06:38,915 --> 00:06:40,849
lt's the chance of a lifetime

55
00:06:42,585 --> 00:06:47,147
l wonder how many of you
have got here in Shanxi?

56
00:06:48,124 --> 00:06:50,319
The CPC and Mao Zedong are aware that

57
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:55,023
the Japanese army
is bearing down upon here

58
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,133
and ordered us to rush here

59
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:02,695
even before the recomposition
is finalized

60
00:07:03,106 --> 00:07:07,406
Lin Biao's 1 15th and
He Long's 120th Divisions

61
00:07:07,443 --> 00:07:09,343
are at the frontline now

62
00:07:10,146 --> 00:07:14,014
Liu Bocheng's 129th Division
is on its way there

63
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:18,851
Together with HQs led by Peng Dehuai

64
00:07:18,888 --> 00:07:20,981
we've got 32000 men here

65
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,820
Sir, tea is ready

66
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,557
Please Please...

67
00:07:27,897 --> 00:07:29,660
Lin Biao, He Long, Liu Bocheng

68
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,429
Peng Dehuai and you

69
00:07:32,468 --> 00:07:35,562
All the five red tigers are here

70
00:07:36,772 --> 00:07:41,869
Shanxi is honored, so is 2nd Theater
and me myself too

71
00:07:41,944 --> 00:07:43,639
We're flattered

72
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:47,445
But we really need your troops to

73
00:07:47,483 --> 00:07:51,317
help Lin Biao
intercepting fleeing enemies

74
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:54,812
Look out!

75
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:57,549
Sure...

76
00:08:04,934 --> 00:08:06,128
lt's really good

77
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:09,667
for setting an ambush here

78
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,265
Will they really pass through here?

79
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,709
Absolutely

80
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,572
They've got so many supplies and gear

81
00:08:18,614 --> 00:08:21,515
They can't possibly fly over here

82
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,119
We 1 15th Division is put in charge

83
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:30,358
This is the first campaign
of our 8th Route Army

84
00:08:31,661 --> 00:08:33,595
How should we beat them?

85
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:41,127
We must build up confidence

86
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:43,001
What if KMT troops don't cooperate?

87
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,135
We need their cooperation

88
00:08:46,742 --> 00:08:48,869
But we can't count on them

89
00:08:49,145 --> 00:08:51,978
We have to fight, even without them

90
00:08:53,716 --> 00:08:55,377
Sir, here they are

91
00:08:56,052 --> 00:08:58,486
lt is an ideal place for an ambush

92
00:08:58,521 --> 00:09:03,424
But l wonder if you have
sufficient men and power

93
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:08,055
One enemy regiment overruns
one of our army groups

94
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:14,527
Your 1 15th Division is poorly equipped
How can you fight?

95
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:19,666
l personally appreciate your courage

96
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,781
Human factor is more important

97
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:31,379
lt's going to rain

98
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:35,652
What if you can't get there on time?

99
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:41,993
The main issue is
whether we can count on

100
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:45,023
your efficient support and cooperation

101
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:46,659
Please rest assured

102
00:09:46,702 --> 00:09:48,397
l've mobilized my reserves

103
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:52,402
We'll attack the Japs from the north

104
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:53,772
to help you pinning them down

105
00:09:54,543 --> 00:09:58,377
That... will be wonderful

106
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:08,921
Sir, HQ orders us to speed up

107
00:11:09,552 --> 00:11:11,042
Captain Yes, sir!

108
00:11:12,054 --> 00:11:14,522
Your company stays for rescue

109
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:16,318
Yes, sir! Follow me, men!

110
00:11:19,462 --> 00:11:20,861
Stand up. Go!

111
00:11:21,564 --> 00:11:22,758
Doc!

112
00:11:32,842 --> 00:11:36,778
Stop...

113
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,646
Sir

114
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:46,553
we met resistance from the Chinese ahead

115
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,179
Get rid of them

116
00:11:49,225 --> 00:11:50,988
Yes, sir

117
00:12:01,203 --> 00:12:05,435
Charge!

118
00:12:08,077 --> 00:12:12,013
Charge!

119
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:16,715
Fire!

120
00:12:35,771 --> 00:12:37,398
Sir

121
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,136
we've smashed a team of KMT army

122
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,444
March on

123
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,484
1 15th Division
is heading towards the location

124
00:12:57,726 --> 00:13:01,162
Any ltagaki scouts are seen over there?

125
00:13:01,597 --> 00:13:04,623
No, they are marching in a queue

126
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:06,692
No scouting or covering forces

127
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:09,260
The Japanese are still blindly arrogant

128
00:13:09,305 --> 00:13:11,466
lt shows our timing is good

129
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,142
We've got to be cautious

130
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,311
Ask Lin Biao

131
00:13:17,413 --> 00:13:21,076
to control the heights in the valley

132
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:25,952
and make sure our flanks are secured

133
00:13:36,866 --> 00:13:39,334
02... come in

134
00:13:39,368 --> 00:13:41,928
02, this is 01 , come in

135
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,134
02... this is 01 , come in

136
00:13:45,608 --> 00:13:47,735
02... come in

137
00:13:47,877 --> 00:13:50,573
02... come in

138
00:13:50,613 --> 00:13:53,707
02... this is 01 , come in

139
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:57,048
02... this is 01 , come in

140
00:14:27,016 --> 00:14:28,347
Get away!

141
00:14:28,684 --> 00:14:29,673
Get away

142
00:14:34,256 --> 00:14:36,952
The Japanese has got into our ambush

143
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:55,033
Their vanguard
has walked out of the valley

144
00:15:02,117 --> 00:15:04,779
Their supply vehicles
are all within the range

145
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:06,783
Go!

146
00:15:45,594 --> 00:15:46,424
lt's up there

147
00:15:56,905 --> 00:15:57,929
Sergeant...

148
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:29,770
Chinese army ambushing us? lmpossible!

149
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:35,636
They must be guerrillas. Wipe them out

150
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:40,975
Yan Xishan?

151
00:16:43,118 --> 00:16:44,449
l know him the best

152
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,348
He is my
lmperial Military School classmate

153
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,782
He doesn't have the guts

154
00:16:54,997 --> 00:16:57,989
Shall we ask for help
from our air forces?

155
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,494
No need

156
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:10,273
Sir, do please give it a thought

157
00:17:13,348 --> 00:17:14,144
Ok, then

158
00:17:42,244 --> 00:17:43,768
The enemy's bombing is fierce

159
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,443
Get our men down there to mix them up

160
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:58,651
Charge...!

161
00:18:17,713 --> 00:18:19,442
The Japanese is taking Laoyemiao

162
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,073
That's a height

163
00:18:22,551 --> 00:18:25,179
Tell Li Tianyou he mustn't lose it

164
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:31,521
Colonel!

165
00:18:35,898 --> 00:18:38,560
Captain, reinforce the height

166
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,965
Go! Yes, sir!

167
00:20:02,017 --> 00:20:04,577
Sir, Gao Guizi, Commander of 1 7th Army

168
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,850
ordered his men
to abandon their positions

169
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,351
Lin Biao's troops are still fighting

170
00:20:12,394 --> 00:20:15,329
Their flanks are exposed
lt's too dangerous

171
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,128
What's to be done?

172
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:21,025
He isn't under my control

173
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:24,698
Shall we get our 71st Division to attack?

174
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,732
so as to cover Lin Biao's men?

175
00:20:32,447 --> 00:20:34,972
ltagaki's reinforcement
is coming from the north

176
00:20:35,017 --> 00:20:36,746
Yan's troops don't do anything

177
00:20:36,785 --> 00:20:39,811
1 15th Division's flank is totally exposed

178
00:20:40,756 --> 00:20:42,587
Lin Biao is prepared for that

179
00:20:42,624 --> 00:20:45,149
He's deployed troops along Yimaling

180
00:20:45,193 --> 00:20:47,093
to check their reinforcements

181
00:20:47,629 --> 00:20:50,689
Ask him to finish the fight
and get out of there

182
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:51,966
Get the horses!

183
00:20:53,902 --> 00:20:54,960
To Pingxingguan

184
00:20:57,639 --> 00:20:58,571
We've got no ammunition

185
00:20:58,607 --> 00:20:59,972
Neither do l

186
00:21:02,544 --> 00:21:04,512
Let's go!

187
00:21:05,113 --> 00:21:08,810
Charge bayonets!

188
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:13,045
Remove bullets

189
00:21:20,128 --> 00:21:22,096
Charge!

190
00:21:25,767 --> 00:21:27,132
Charge!

191
00:21:30,138 --> 00:21:33,335
Charge!

192
00:22:35,504 --> 00:22:37,995
What...?

193
00:22:38,874 --> 00:22:41,172
Bayonet charge?

194
00:22:47,382 --> 00:22:49,111
Who the hell are they?

195
00:22:59,694 --> 00:23:02,686
They must be 8th Route Army

196
00:24:15,804 --> 00:24:20,070
101 ... come in, 101

197
00:24:20,108 --> 00:24:22,133
lt's their 1 1th charge now

198
00:24:22,177 --> 00:24:26,011
We have to fight with bayonets

199
00:24:31,987 --> 00:24:33,420
Hold it at all costs!

200
00:25:41,189 --> 00:25:42,213
Give up! No harm!

201
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,256
Give up! No harm!

202
00:25:48,597 --> 00:25:50,531
Give up! No harm...!

203
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:52,797
Get out of here

204
00:26:15,223 --> 00:26:17,214
Come here, he's still alive

205
00:26:18,593 --> 00:26:19,651
Coming

206
00:26:26,268 --> 00:26:29,431
Make sure to keep him alive

207
00:27:03,838 --> 00:27:05,806
No!

208
00:28:04,733 --> 00:28:07,065
Attention!

209
00:28:35,764 --> 00:28:36,731
At ease!

210
00:28:39,768 --> 00:28:41,633
At ease!

211
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:52,403
Today, September 25, 1937

212
00:28:54,616 --> 00:28:57,517
is a day that astonished the whole world

213
00:28:58,753 --> 00:29:02,553
that will be recorded
into the history of China

214
00:29:04,626 --> 00:29:10,758
Because we defeated
the most ferocious enemy

215
00:29:11,466 --> 00:29:14,264
the ltagaki's troops

216
00:29:21,376 --> 00:29:23,367
Who is this ltagaki?

217
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:29,343
He is one of the plotters
behind 9.18 lncident

218
00:29:30,585 --> 00:29:35,113
He also made the last Qing emperor Puyi

219
00:29:35,156 --> 00:29:38,284
emperor of the puppet state of Manchukuo

220
00:29:38,326 --> 00:29:44,458
Down with ltagaki!
Down with Japanese lmperialism...!

221
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,500
You defeated the scoundrel today

222
00:29:50,672 --> 00:29:53,038
This is the most severe setback

223
00:29:53,074 --> 00:29:57,340
for the Japanese invaders since 1937

224
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:03,708
To date back further
it's their most severe setback

225
00:30:03,751 --> 00:30:08,120
ever since
the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894

226
00:30:09,357 --> 00:30:13,987
Your confidence and braveness

227
00:30:14,128 --> 00:30:18,531
crushed the myth of
Japanese imperial army

228
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:22,434
Your willpower of iron
and spirit of sacrifice

229
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,301
declared to the world

230
00:30:25,139 --> 00:30:29,007
the Chinese people and nation

231
00:30:29,043 --> 00:30:33,275
can never be conquered

232
00:30:34,048 --> 00:30:36,573
Long live the Chinese nation!

233
00:30:37,218 --> 00:30:47,719
Long live the Chinese nation...

234
00:30:53,468 --> 00:30:57,734
Long live the Chinese nation!

235
00:30:59,173 --> 00:31:03,337
Long live 8th Route Army!

236
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,413
Another compliment

237
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:26,628
lt's a pity l can't take the credit

238
00:31:26,868 --> 00:31:29,803
Now 8th Route Army stands firm in Shanxi

239
00:31:35,009 --> 00:31:37,739
Commander-in-chief...

240
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:38,677
Comrade Rongzhen

241
00:31:38,713 --> 00:31:39,805
Look

242
00:31:40,381 --> 00:31:43,350
This is a Japanese military map

243
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,886
This is where we are, Nanru Village

244
00:31:47,922 --> 00:31:51,915
But Yan's map is too simple
to mark the village

245
00:31:52,961 --> 00:31:55,191
This map of China drawn by the Japanese

246
00:31:55,229 --> 00:31:57,459
is more detailed and accurate

247
00:31:59,968 --> 00:32:04,166
lt shows their conspiracy
existed long long ago

248
00:32:04,472 --> 00:32:06,064
How is the result of the campaign?

249
00:32:06,107 --> 00:32:07,699
Over 1000 enemy soldiers were killed

250
00:32:07,742 --> 00:32:10,108
Our casualty is about the same

251
00:32:10,244 --> 00:32:12,235
We've never had such kind of a fight

252
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,645
They're really tough

253
00:32:14,415 --> 00:32:17,714
They were brain-washed by militarism

254
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,219
Any POWs?

255
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:24,154
We've checked it out, no POWs

256
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:27,050
Not a single one? No

257
00:32:34,235 --> 00:32:36,863
Ren, can l interview Zhu De now?

258
00:32:37,171 --> 00:32:39,298
l'm afraid not

259
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,365
Comrade Zhu De is now
in command of the battle

260
00:32:41,409 --> 00:32:43,809
So he has no time for the time being

261
00:32:45,013 --> 00:32:48,949
He never has time, always busy

262
00:32:49,117 --> 00:32:52,712
When ever will l finish the biography?

263
00:32:55,823 --> 00:32:59,554
Commander-in-chief
in common people's eyes

264
00:32:59,761 --> 00:33:04,562
lt can best show
the truth of our people's army

265
00:33:06,434 --> 00:33:10,803
Ren, you're really a politician

266
00:33:15,777 --> 00:33:18,211
At such a critical moment

267
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,910
you two agreed to be

268
00:33:20,948 --> 00:33:24,440
vice commanders of my 2nd Theater

269
00:33:25,653 --> 00:33:29,214
l really appreciate your support

270
00:33:29,323 --> 00:33:33,521
The fate of this nation is at stake
l have to

271
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:39,423
Mr. Chiang is afraid that the Japanese

272
00:33:39,467 --> 00:33:42,925
would go all the way
to Sichuan through Shanxi

273
00:33:43,204 --> 00:33:47,163
and outflank from the southwest
to take China

274
00:33:47,675 --> 00:33:51,441
So the Xinkou Campaign is vital

275
00:33:51,646 --> 00:33:54,114
lt can never be underestimated

276
00:33:54,248 --> 00:33:57,046
We wish we could be of some help to you

277
00:33:57,719 --> 00:34:01,120
Please... Please

278
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,619
Since we are Chinese armies

279
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,651
and we're all anti-Japanese

280
00:34:07,695 --> 00:34:10,220
we should break away with the systems

281
00:34:10,264 --> 00:34:14,166
and set up a united anti-Japan force
to fight together

282
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:20,400
Our armies will be mixed
into three routes

283
00:34:20,942 --> 00:34:23,740
The east route will be headed by Zhu De

284
00:34:23,778 --> 00:34:26,713
The middle route by Lihuang

285
00:34:26,748 --> 00:34:30,047
And l'll take care of the west route

286
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:33,079
What do you think?

287
00:34:33,121 --> 00:34:35,749
Ok, all forces of Central Army
along the east route

288
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,758
will also be given to Zhu De

289
00:34:40,361 --> 00:34:42,329
lt applies to my Shanxi Army too

290
00:34:42,864 --> 00:34:47,324
You two can take our men
on the middle and west routes

291
00:34:47,902 --> 00:34:49,802
There's no problem with that

292
00:34:50,938 --> 00:34:52,963
l only hope you can see

293
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,602
if there is anything good
about 8th Route Army

294
00:34:57,111 --> 00:34:59,102
it is that flexible as we are

295
00:34:59,714 --> 00:35:02,740
we can start guerrilla warfare
behind enemies

296
00:35:03,918 --> 00:35:06,478
lt is also our fighting principle

297
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:11,185
and has been endorsed
by the Generalissimo

298
00:35:16,964 --> 00:35:18,261
Of course...

299
00:35:19,267 --> 00:35:24,034
The treasure of Jinci is not the temple

300
00:35:24,572 --> 00:35:27,006
lt's the three fountains

301
00:35:27,909 --> 00:35:29,934
lt's rather peculiar

302
00:35:30,678 --> 00:35:35,672
Wherever originated
they are merged here

303
00:35:36,417 --> 00:35:39,352
irrigating the vast farmland
in central Shanxi

304
00:35:40,822 --> 00:35:49,321
So even three waters in Shanxi are united

305
00:35:49,864 --> 00:35:51,729
Yes, united

306
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,694
To fight against the Japs

307
00:36:11,018 --> 00:36:13,486
Damned! Dare you come down here?

308
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:19,992
ls that Liu Bocheng?

309
00:36:20,695 --> 00:36:22,788
Judging from the taking off frequency

310
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,923
there must be a Japanese airbase here

311
00:36:24,966 --> 00:36:27,867
Find it and blow it up

312
00:39:27,681 --> 00:39:28,705
Very good!

313
00:39:29,483 --> 00:39:32,077
We don't know
how to deal with air bombings

314
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:35,355
Chen Xilian blew up their entire airbase

315
00:39:35,923 --> 00:39:38,391
120th Division led by He Long

316
00:39:38,426 --> 00:39:40,826
also had a marvelous ambush at Yanmenguan

317
00:39:41,228 --> 00:39:42,752
and cut off the enemy's supply

318
00:39:43,531 --> 00:39:48,332
Wei Lihuang will have
an easier time guarding Xinkou

319
00:39:54,208 --> 00:39:56,574
Dare you come up here?

320
00:39:57,578 --> 00:40:00,206
Where are your planes?

321
00:40:00,414 --> 00:40:02,905
Are they hatching now?

322
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:12,785
Chairman Mao believes
the recovery victory is temporary

323
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,627
Taiyuan will be lost soon

324
00:40:15,062 --> 00:40:18,589
Our army's principle
is still the guerilla warfare

325
00:40:19,533 --> 00:40:22,969
Yan and Chiang have the same idea

326
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:26,734
Both want to stick to Taiyuan
and ask us for help

327
00:40:26,974 --> 00:40:30,205
Chiang's passive recovery
will fail for sure

328
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,647
But Yan's still fighting against the Japs

329
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,149
we must help him

330
00:40:36,717 --> 00:40:38,742
Here is my idea

331
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:42,587
Our main force will attack the Japs' rear

332
00:40:42,623 --> 00:40:45,285
to support KMT's recovery efforts

333
00:40:45,326 --> 00:40:49,456
As Chairman Mao said
we'll also set up four bases

334
00:40:49,663 --> 00:40:53,929
in northeastern, southeastern

335
00:40:53,968 --> 00:40:58,234
southwestern and
the border area of Shanxi

336
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:25,498
Some family members
of most of these women

337
00:41:25,533 --> 00:41:27,194
have died at the front

338
00:41:27,668 --> 00:41:29,829
And their Save-the-nation
Committee organizes

339
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:33,397
the villagers to make shoes
for the Red Army soldiers

340
00:41:35,442 --> 00:41:37,069
Which kind of flower is it?

341
00:41:37,811 --> 00:41:39,369
They are lotus flowers

342
00:41:40,548 --> 00:41:45,247
But there is only one usually
how come there is two?

343
00:41:45,886 --> 00:41:49,287
She said there should be only one flower

344
00:41:49,323 --> 00:41:50,620
instead of two

345
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:56,655
They are twin-lotus-flowers

346
00:41:59,567 --> 00:42:01,398
ln the Chinese folk culture

347
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:04,802
the twin-lotus-flowers
are a symbol of love

348
00:42:05,172 --> 00:42:06,298
Of love?

349
00:42:07,975 --> 00:42:09,840
She made the pads

350
00:42:09,877 --> 00:42:12,607
for her husband

351
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,375
But he's gone to the front

352
00:42:14,415 --> 00:42:21,150
only 3 days after their wedding

353
00:42:22,723 --> 00:42:24,748
Did he go willingly or was he forced to?

354
00:42:25,659 --> 00:42:27,490
Did he go willingly or was he forced to?

355
00:42:29,697 --> 00:42:36,535
l took him there myself

356
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:40,233
He himself demanded to go to the front

357
00:42:40,274 --> 00:42:41,241
lt's no wonder

358
00:42:41,275 --> 00:42:47,908
All his family except himself
were killed by the Japs

359
00:42:51,385 --> 00:42:55,082
Our victory at Pingxingguan
crushed invaders' morale

360
00:42:55,122 --> 00:42:57,556
and stimulated that of all the Chinese

361
00:42:57,591 --> 00:43:00,719
The Resistance movement's
spreading across the country

362
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,820
Japan sent even more
armed forces to China

363
00:43:03,864 --> 00:43:06,526
to attack Taiyuan
a strategic city in North China

364
00:43:06,567 --> 00:43:09,127
At Yanmenguan and Niangziguan

365
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:13,333
the two sides are engaged
in vehement fights

366
00:43:32,726 --> 00:43:35,194
Guys, we'll die sooner or later

367
00:43:35,229 --> 00:43:38,596
Killed by Japs
we are at least heroic martyrs

368
00:43:38,632 --> 00:43:40,862
Guys, charge!

369
00:43:40,901 --> 00:43:43,699
Charge!

370
00:43:47,608 --> 00:43:50,771
Please send reinforcements right now

371
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:55,544
Hello...

372
00:43:55,683 --> 00:43:59,517
Taiyuan is lost...

373
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:11,463
Commander He...

374
00:44:11,765 --> 00:44:13,665
More enemies are coming

375
00:44:13,701 --> 00:44:15,566
lt's the guarding gate of Taiyuan

376
00:44:15,602 --> 00:44:17,160
Your One-armed Colonel

377
00:44:17,204 --> 00:44:18,603
Get him up there

378
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:21,437
Not a single enemy can be let go
Yes, sir

379
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:23,467
Colonel...

380
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,478
He's up there already

381
00:45:18,699 --> 00:45:19,461
Sir

382
00:45:26,673 --> 00:45:30,165
Now you've seen for yourselves

383
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:33,010
your Brigadier has died for the country

384
00:45:35,015 --> 00:45:37,848
l'll be taking his place now

385
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:44,750
We must get Height 1 300 back

386
00:45:47,027 --> 00:45:49,621
lf someone backs off just one step

387
00:45:50,597 --> 00:45:53,293
my pistol will not tolerate

388
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:56,966
Should l back off

389
00:45:58,372 --> 00:46:00,431
everyone of you can shoot me

390
00:46:10,451 --> 00:46:11,611
Tommy gun!

391
00:46:12,419 --> 00:46:14,080
No, you can't go up there

392
00:46:14,121 --> 00:46:17,784
You can't get through

393
00:46:18,826 --> 00:46:19,884
Right, you can't get through

394
00:46:33,507 --> 00:46:34,667
Please wait, sir!

395
00:46:36,143 --> 00:46:37,337
We'll go

396
00:46:38,745 --> 00:46:44,877
l'll fight to death together with you

397
00:49:04,891 --> 00:49:05,880
Yes, sir

398
00:49:07,461 --> 00:49:09,725
Tell Colonel to retreat

399
00:49:09,763 --> 00:49:10,388
Yes, sir

400
00:49:18,772 --> 00:49:21,969
Sir, we're ordered to retreat

401
00:49:22,843 --> 00:49:24,970
What? What did you say?

402
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,776
Niangziguan was lost

403
00:49:56,209 --> 00:49:57,733
Why?

404
00:50:10,023 --> 00:50:12,753
This is the latest intelligence
on the Japs

405
00:50:16,563 --> 00:50:18,190
They moved forward so fast that

406
00:50:18,632 --> 00:50:21,567
even before Yan's
2nd defense line was formed

407
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:23,193
they've broken through

408
00:50:25,072 --> 00:50:28,473
Dispatch work groups
to all the counties in Shanxi

409
00:50:28,542 --> 00:50:30,806
to set up anti-Japanese
democratic regimes

410
00:50:31,511 --> 00:50:35,777
and train local guerilla teams

411
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,111
just like hens laying eggs

412
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:40,779
by making hen roosts everywhere

413
00:50:41,054 --> 00:50:43,614
Fu Zuoyi is
a well-known defending general

414
00:50:43,657 --> 00:50:46,023
He won't give up Taiyuan easily

415
00:50:46,059 --> 00:50:47,822
l've persuaded him not to be

416
00:50:47,861 --> 00:50:50,523
too particular about
the loss of one or two cities

417
00:50:50,564 --> 00:50:52,225
We are good at guerilla warfare

418
00:50:52,265 --> 00:50:54,699
But they are not so flexible

419
00:50:56,169 --> 00:50:58,569
Our HQs will move further south

420
00:50:58,605 --> 00:51:00,971
to be prepared for the loss of Taiyuan

421
00:51:07,614 --> 00:51:09,980
Sir, telegram from the Generalissimo

422
00:51:16,056 --> 00:51:17,387
Move to the south?

423
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:23,118
People can move, what about properties?

424
00:51:25,766 --> 00:51:28,997
No Parties or Armies can be counted on

425
00:51:31,738 --> 00:51:34,036
We have to rely upon ourselves

426
00:51:36,076 --> 00:51:39,842
l will live or die with the city

427
00:51:41,481 --> 00:51:43,779
We can't afford to lose Taiyuan

428
00:51:44,317 --> 00:51:47,684
lf the city is lost
so will the province be

429
00:52:27,127 --> 00:52:30,324
Sir. Doihara's division
is rushing here from the east

430
00:52:30,363 --> 00:52:32,957
while Tojo Hideki
is coming down from the north

431
00:52:32,999 --> 00:52:35,593
Taiyuan is about to fall really soon

432
00:52:40,307 --> 00:52:42,901
Maybe we should have done as Zhu De said

433
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,790
ln Shanxi and North China

434
00:53:08,835 --> 00:53:11,895
the frontal warfare by KMT is over now

435
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:14,304
Self-dependent mountain guerilla warfare

436
00:53:14,341 --> 00:53:16,707
by CPC will play major roles in the War

437
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:18,507
From the telegram by Chairman Mao

438
00:53:18,545 --> 00:53:21,343
The Situation and Our Tasks
After the Loss of Taiyuan

439
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:25,774
Our experiences so far show that

440
00:53:25,819 --> 00:53:29,755
Chinese armies are still
no match for the Japanese

441
00:53:32,826 --> 00:53:35,818
Sir, an unknown cadre is here to see you

442
00:53:35,862 --> 00:53:38,353
He mentioned a suicide team

443
00:53:38,398 --> 00:53:39,296
Just outside

444
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:43,160
Suicide Team! Get him here

445
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:46,330
Yes, sir Wait, l'll go and see him

446
00:53:54,114 --> 00:53:56,514
l'm here to see Commander Zhu

447
00:53:57,517 --> 00:53:58,677
l am Zhu De

448
00:54:01,087 --> 00:54:03,487
Commander-in-chief Zhu!

449
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:06,191
l'm Bo Yibo, a CPC member

450
00:54:06,226 --> 00:54:07,659
l know who you are

451
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:12,063
Before l left Yan'an, Mao mentioned you

452
00:54:12,399 --> 00:54:16,392
saying you're young and talented

453
00:54:17,103 --> 00:54:19,196
You set up a Suicide Team

454
00:54:19,439 --> 00:54:21,304
and an anti-Japanese base

455
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:23,809
in the Wutai Mountains

456
00:54:24,311 --> 00:54:25,801
You're really something

457
00:54:26,246 --> 00:54:27,736
l'm embarrassed

458
00:54:28,381 --> 00:54:30,042
This is the first time l met you

459
00:54:30,083 --> 00:54:32,381
You're not what l expected

460
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:36,850
You look just like an ordinary farmer

461
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:42,461
Peng said our 3 divisions will go

462
00:54:42,495 --> 00:54:44,520
to the Japs' rear area

463
00:54:45,165 --> 00:54:47,895
l wonder what my suicide team
is supposed to do

464
00:54:48,435 --> 00:54:51,029
You'd better evacuate from Wutai

465
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:54,204
lt's not easy for you to set up the team

466
00:54:54,908 --> 00:54:56,773
lt's led by CPC

467
00:54:56,810 --> 00:54:59,404
but it's also a part of Yan's troops

468
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,477
They're all youngsters from Shanxi

469
00:55:02,916 --> 00:55:05,544
We must make the best use of them

470
00:55:05,652 --> 00:55:09,748
Ok then
take your team to southern Shanxi

471
00:55:10,256 --> 00:55:13,089
They are all from Shanxi

472
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:15,525
They know how to stimulate
the local people

473
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:23,032
The North Bureau of CPC
Command of 2nd Theater

474
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:25,731
and Office of 8th Route Army need

475
00:55:26,106 --> 00:55:28,404
at least 3 to 4 days
to evacuate from Linfen

476
00:55:28,441 --> 00:55:30,807
We decided that you take 2 companies

477
00:55:30,844 --> 00:55:34,610
to check southbound enemies on your way

478
00:55:35,949 --> 00:55:37,940
The Guard has only 3 companies

479
00:55:37,984 --> 00:55:39,144
l'll take just one with me

480
00:55:39,319 --> 00:55:41,219
One company is not enough

481
00:55:42,155 --> 00:55:45,283
With two you can have two defending lines

482
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:48,223
But... They're more important to you

483
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:52,459
You take two companies
we're fine with just one

484
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:55,063
and won't be exposed so easily

485
00:55:55,168 --> 00:55:57,295
Besides, the three companies

486
00:55:57,337 --> 00:56:00,272
will meet in a few days anyway

487
00:56:00,874 --> 00:56:02,739
l'll go right now Ok

488
00:56:06,212 --> 00:56:07,304
You take care

489
00:56:12,519 --> 00:56:15,010
Zhu, l've never heard such a thing as

490
00:56:15,055 --> 00:56:16,750
Commander-in-chief has no troops

491
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:22,592
and vice chief of staff's striking
in the battlefield

492
00:56:24,431 --> 00:56:26,922
Get ready and set out now

493
00:56:33,039 --> 00:56:34,973
Guo Yes, sir

494
00:56:35,408 --> 00:56:37,876
Hongdong County men reported that

495
00:56:37,911 --> 00:56:40,277
the Guangshengshang Temple in Huoshan

496
00:56:41,114 --> 00:56:42,843
houses a copy of 'Dazang Sutra'

497
00:56:43,049 --> 00:56:44,710
Tell Bo Yibo right now to have it

498
00:56:44,918 --> 00:56:47,318
remove to a safer place

499
00:56:47,954 --> 00:56:48,613
Yes, sir

500
00:56:51,224 --> 00:56:52,350
Commander

501
00:56:52,392 --> 00:56:53,620
Commander Zhu

502
00:56:56,696 --> 00:56:59,722
Xiaoping, Bocheng, how come you're here?

503
00:56:59,766 --> 00:57:02,860
386th Brigade will stay with HQs

504
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:05,562
lt's too dangerous
without guarding troops

505
00:57:05,605 --> 00:57:09,132
Chen Geng with 386th Brigade
is here to report for duty

506
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:12,508
No need, the harder you strike out there

507
00:57:12,545 --> 00:57:15,480
the safer we will be here

508
00:57:21,087 --> 00:57:25,387
Biaolishan River, Shanxi

509
00:57:25,425 --> 00:57:30,658
lt's easy to defend
and hard to attack here

510
00:57:31,397 --> 00:57:33,627
l don't think so

511
00:57:35,068 --> 00:57:39,971
This Fenhe River Valley is in front of us

512
00:57:40,006 --> 00:57:43,464
lf we march along the valley

513
00:57:44,244 --> 00:57:48,408
once we're in the Taihang

514
00:57:48,448 --> 00:57:51,679
who can stop us?

515
00:57:51,918 --> 00:57:54,614
Our capturing Taiyuan

516
00:57:54,654 --> 00:58:00,286
shows their defending
has crashed thoroughly

517
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:03,921
They are fleeing to southern Shanxi

518
00:58:03,963 --> 00:58:07,262
to a small town called Linfen

519
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:11,031
We can wipe them out right there

520
00:58:12,338 --> 00:58:15,535
The communists are guerilla guys

521
00:58:16,142 --> 00:58:19,077
They won't stay inside the town

522
00:58:19,612 --> 00:58:23,878
The KMT army has well been defeated

523
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:30,216
So our focus is to eliminate
CPC's 8th Route Army

524
00:58:31,524 --> 00:58:33,549
l'll go and capture Zhu De alive

525
00:58:43,303 --> 00:58:45,931
China's population is 450 million

526
00:58:45,972 --> 00:58:48,133
and 80% are farmers

527
00:58:50,977 --> 00:58:52,535
So far, none of the farmers

528
00:58:52,579 --> 00:58:55,013
has said to the world
what he wants to say

529
00:58:55,048 --> 00:59:01,681
But you have become Commander-in-chief
of 8th Route Army

530
00:59:01,988 --> 00:59:05,185
ln our 8th Route Army
Peng Dehuai and Zuo Quan

531
00:59:05,225 --> 00:59:06,715
are also guerrilla experts

532
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,451
ln our 8th Route Army
Peng Dehuai and Zuo Quan

533
00:59:09,495 --> 00:59:10,985
are also guerrilla experts

534
00:59:13,566 --> 00:59:15,193
But it has been four days

535
00:59:15,235 --> 00:59:17,203
Zuo Quan hasn't come back
from the battlefield yet

536
00:59:18,338 --> 00:59:19,930
But it has been four days

537
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,407
Zuo Quan hasn't come back
from the battlefield yet

538
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:28,344
Please

539
00:59:30,516 --> 00:59:33,383
Where are our 3 divisions now?

540
00:59:33,953 --> 00:59:37,480
Zuo Quan is back

541
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:39,717
Really? That's great!

542
00:59:39,859 --> 00:59:44,319
Well, l'll take you to Zuo Quan

543
00:59:44,731 --> 00:59:47,700
So you won't always interview me

544
00:59:48,701 --> 00:59:49,599
Please

545
01:00:28,474 --> 01:00:30,499
We have no photo studios here

546
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:31,908
See handprints of our daughter Beibei

547
01:00:57,203 --> 01:00:59,865
My dear wife. Got your letter

548
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,771
Although you are not able to

549
01:01:01,808 --> 01:01:05,266
take a picture of our daughter

550
01:01:05,311 --> 01:01:08,747
l feel satisfied to see her handprints

551
01:01:09,282 --> 01:01:12,149
Back from the 4 days and 3 nights battle

552
01:01:12,185 --> 01:01:15,416
the first thing l did was to write to you

553
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:18,356
lf l died in the battle

554
01:01:18,391 --> 01:01:20,655
l wouldn't have any regret

555
01:01:21,461 --> 01:01:23,520
for all my life except that

556
01:01:23,563 --> 01:01:26,930
l've never seen our daughter

557
01:01:27,667 --> 01:01:31,228
and done nothing for her

558
01:01:31,871 --> 01:01:33,896
as a father

559
01:01:34,807 --> 01:01:39,301
So please kiss her more since l can't

560
01:01:45,685 --> 01:01:48,085
Hi, Commander-in-chief Hi

561
01:01:48,521 --> 01:01:50,819
Ms. Smedley, Ms Zhang interprets

562
01:01:50,857 --> 01:01:51,653
Commander-in-chief

563
01:01:51,691 --> 01:01:56,025
Peng Dehuai's troops have started out

564
01:01:56,062 --> 01:01:59,054
We shall leave at once

565
01:01:59,432 --> 01:02:01,559
What about me?

566
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:07,405
You'll be sent to Yan'an as arranged

567
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,704
l wouldn't go anywhere

568
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:18,940
lt's hard for a woman like you on the way

569
01:02:19,552 --> 01:02:21,679
l didn't want to be a woman

570
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:24,016
God made me one!

571
01:02:25,191 --> 01:02:27,819
l didn't want to be a woman

572
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:29,919
God made me one!

573
01:02:30,963 --> 01:02:32,157
Ms. Smedley

574
01:02:33,399 --> 01:02:36,891
l hope you obey the orders

575
01:02:45,912 --> 01:02:51,373
Your biography will be named
'The Great Path'

576
01:02:52,084 --> 01:02:55,986
lt's not that great

577
01:02:57,223 --> 01:03:01,182
Actually it's a tortuous path

578
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:06,798
just like this one under our feet

579
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:10,897
Commander-in-chief of 8th Route Army

580
01:03:10,937 --> 01:03:14,532
is seeing off a foreign female journalist

581
01:03:14,574 --> 01:03:19,773
l'd say it's the son of Chinese peasants

582
01:03:19,812 --> 01:03:26,809
seeing off the daughter
of an American miner

583
01:03:30,790 --> 01:03:34,351
Can l bid farewell to you
as Americans do?

584
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:44,461
We both are wearing uniforms
of 8th Route Army

585
01:03:44,504 --> 01:03:49,532
and armbands too

586
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:58,210
So we should bid farewell as soldiers do

587
01:04:09,028 --> 01:04:10,723
l love 8th Route Army

588
01:04:45,731 --> 01:04:49,258
The rear guard is fighting with
over 1000 enemy soldiers

589
01:04:49,502 --> 01:04:50,560
Great

590
01:04:51,871 --> 01:04:52,963
Hold them down till dusk

591
01:04:53,739 --> 01:04:55,764
The more are attracted to us

592
01:04:56,275 --> 01:04:58,402
the safer HQs will be

593
01:04:58,744 --> 01:04:59,574
Got it

594
01:05:02,448 --> 01:05:03,710
The KMT men crossed the Yellow River

595
01:05:03,749 --> 01:05:05,842
Yan Xishan retreated to Qiulin, Shanxi

596
01:05:05,885 --> 01:05:07,750
Wei Lihuang to Luoyang, Henan

597
01:05:08,387 --> 01:05:09,877
We won't

598
01:05:10,523 --> 01:05:12,718
We'll be guerillas on Mt. Taihang

599
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:22,465
Planes are coming, go and hide

600
01:05:39,051 --> 01:05:39,983
Yes, sir

601
01:05:47,493 --> 01:05:48,425
Got it

602
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:52,857
They bombarded Guzhen in Qinshui

603
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:55,993
Guzhen?

604
01:05:59,438 --> 01:06:00,166
Leave here

605
01:06:06,145 --> 01:06:07,578
Follow up

606
01:06:08,147 --> 01:06:09,409
He is really a prophet

607
01:06:09,448 --> 01:06:11,382
lf he said they won't bomb, they won't

608
01:06:11,417 --> 01:06:13,408
lf he said they will, and here they are

609
01:06:13,452 --> 01:06:15,716
He knows their minds too well

610
01:06:15,755 --> 01:06:18,656
The town they're bombing
is also called Guzhen

611
01:06:18,691 --> 01:06:21,091
lt shows their real target is us

612
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:23,788
They bombed the wrong place
so they'll come back

613
01:06:23,829 --> 01:06:25,057
Follow up

614
01:06:25,097 --> 01:06:26,724
He's really smart

615
01:06:28,434 --> 01:06:30,925
Hurry up

616
01:06:40,279 --> 01:06:40,938
Lie up

617
01:06:44,316 --> 01:06:46,807
Hurry up

618
01:07:47,947 --> 01:07:51,144
We knew 104th Brigade has got into

619
01:07:51,183 --> 01:07:55,210
the heart of 8th Route Army's base

620
01:07:55,254 --> 01:08:02,023
The Japanese national flag is flicking
on the roof of their HQs

621
01:08:02,061 --> 01:08:03,028
l can imagine

622
01:08:03,062 --> 01:08:08,932
you're reading my telegram
on Zhu De's chair

623
01:08:08,968 --> 01:08:15,532
We are exited about and jealous of this

624
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:20,475
Where is Zhu De now?

625
01:08:23,949 --> 01:08:29,444
Sir, we've monitored
radio signals near here

626
01:08:29,488 --> 01:08:31,012
lt must be Zhu De...

627
01:08:31,624 --> 01:08:35,060
lt must be Zhu De? Good

628
01:08:38,798 --> 01:08:39,594
Set out now

629
01:08:42,067 --> 01:08:44,558
Right turn! Eyes front!

630
01:08:44,837 --> 01:08:46,236
Guo Yes, sir

631
01:08:47,306 --> 01:08:50,275
Everyone will be given a bayonet, rifle

632
01:08:50,309 --> 01:08:51,207
Have they got them?

633
01:08:51,243 --> 01:08:52,835
Yes, sir Where's mine?

634
01:09:09,361 --> 01:09:10,487
Set out! Yes, sir

635
01:09:15,301 --> 01:09:17,599
Hurry up

636
01:09:26,545 --> 01:09:27,569
Lie up

637
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:30,044
Load

638
01:09:49,068 --> 01:09:51,628
Bandits, you Japanese bandits

639
01:09:51,670 --> 01:09:53,501
Guo Yes, sir

640
01:09:53,873 --> 01:09:55,534
Telegraph to Liu and Deng

641
01:09:55,574 --> 01:09:57,633
to come and rescue local people

642
01:09:58,010 --> 01:09:59,773
Wait. No telegraphing

643
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:03,407
They've decoded our telegram
so they're here so soon

644
01:10:09,822 --> 01:10:13,952
You Japanese bandits...! Let me out!

645
01:10:16,528 --> 01:10:18,894
Those can tell where their radio is

646
01:10:18,931 --> 01:10:19,920
can be released

647
01:10:20,532 --> 01:10:21,328
Yes, sir

648
01:10:22,001 --> 01:10:23,935
Listen carefully

649
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:26,699
lf you tell us where their radio is

650
01:10:26,739 --> 01:10:28,331
l'll let you out

651
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:41,110
Go and send it now!
What are you waiting for?

652
01:10:42,521 --> 01:10:45,183
Turn it on, l'll talk to Liu and Deng

653
01:10:49,762 --> 01:10:52,356
l really mean talk, uncoded

654
01:10:56,435 --> 01:10:58,733
My classmate...

655
01:10:59,038 --> 01:11:00,733
l want to...

656
01:11:01,206 --> 01:11:02,036
What?

657
01:11:02,942 --> 01:11:03,909
What did you say?

658
01:11:05,244 --> 01:11:06,233
Commissar Deng

659
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:08,677
HQ's talking, l can't understand

660
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:18,112
to my classmate at Frunze
lt's Zuo Quan

661
01:11:19,124 --> 01:11:24,221
l'm your classmate
at Sun Yat-sen University

662
01:11:24,964 --> 01:11:27,865
ls Commander-in-chief safe now?

663
01:11:32,037 --> 01:11:34,198
l'm your classmate at Frunze

664
01:11:36,875 --> 01:11:37,807
Got it

665
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:43,507
Ye's 772nd Regiment is close to you...

666
01:11:44,016 --> 01:11:44,914
Sir

667
01:11:46,652 --> 01:11:50,850
They're talking in an unknown language
not Chinese

668
01:11:50,956 --> 01:11:52,014
What?

669
01:11:55,828 --> 01:12:00,060
l'll send Ye right now to close them in

670
01:12:00,099 --> 01:12:01,657
lt sounds like Russian

671
01:12:03,535 --> 01:12:04,900
Yes, it is Russian

672
01:12:06,038 --> 01:12:08,506
l wish l had
a Russian Japanese dictionary

673
01:12:31,330 --> 01:12:33,764
You Japanese bandits!

674
01:12:34,733 --> 01:12:35,700
Hurry up

675
01:12:38,570 --> 01:12:40,435
You bandits

676
01:12:50,849 --> 01:12:51,838
Hurry up

677
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:00,550
Let's go

678
01:13:00,592 --> 01:13:01,991
Retreat

679
01:13:08,033 --> 01:13:09,159
Ye Chenghuan's here

680
01:13:14,173 --> 01:13:17,472
Retreat...

681
01:13:20,679 --> 01:13:23,910
Spear Team is here to report for duty

682
01:13:24,817 --> 01:13:27,012
Ok, go and rescue them Yes, sir

683
01:13:30,022 --> 01:13:32,286
No, retreat

684
01:13:36,261 --> 01:13:37,694
Charge

685
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:49,398
How about the local folks?

686
01:13:49,808 --> 01:13:50,968
They're safe now

687
01:13:51,376 --> 01:13:53,708
But Commander Ye was killed

688
01:13:58,083 --> 01:13:59,050
Go get them!

689
01:14:01,453 --> 01:14:02,943
Go get them now!

690
01:16:19,591 --> 01:16:20,615
Please

691
01:16:24,229 --> 01:16:25,389
Vice Commander-in-chief

692
01:16:25,497 --> 01:16:27,863
The Japs wanted to drive us
across the River

693
01:16:27,899 --> 01:16:30,800
And we're having the meeting
in their rear area

694
01:16:31,470 --> 01:16:34,268
Congratulations to you

695
01:16:35,707 --> 01:16:37,334
Let me introduce them to you

696
01:16:37,376 --> 01:16:39,844
Vice Commander of 129th Division
Xu Xiangqian

697
01:16:40,145 --> 01:16:41,806
Commander-in-chief of Red 4th Army

698
01:16:42,114 --> 01:16:44,674
We fought but never met each other

699
01:16:46,084 --> 01:16:48,644
We now met each other
and will never fight

700
01:16:49,154 --> 01:16:50,416
No discord, no concord

701
01:16:52,124 --> 01:16:53,148
Commander-in-chief Zhu

702
01:16:53,492 --> 01:16:55,084
l'm Zhu Huaibing

703
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:59,194
l hope you won't be
as stingy as Yan Xishan

704
01:16:59,464 --> 01:17:03,059
Better show us
some secrets for resistance

705
01:17:04,169 --> 01:17:07,400
Mao's 'On Protracted War' is the secret

706
01:17:08,073 --> 01:17:12,373
Our enemy now is more powerful

707
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:14,641
but we've got more people

708
01:17:15,347 --> 01:17:19,010
China is always
on the side of righteousness

709
01:17:19,951 --> 01:17:21,885
As long as we count on the local people

710
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:24,218
and adopt the right way of fighting

711
01:17:24,256 --> 01:17:27,089
we'll get them into stalemate

712
01:17:27,426 --> 01:17:29,223
depleting their forces

713
01:17:29,261 --> 01:17:30,888
and eventually win over Japan

714
01:17:31,863 --> 01:17:32,852
Excellent

715
01:17:35,167 --> 01:17:39,263
lt sounds like the best way
for the time being

716
01:17:42,507 --> 01:17:44,702
Mao Zedong's 'On Protracted War'

717
01:17:45,644 --> 01:17:47,339
lsn't that guerilla thing?

718
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,707
We're all armymen

719
01:17:50,182 --> 01:17:54,243
No military theory
takes guerilla as tactics

720
01:17:54,286 --> 01:17:56,516
Protracted war is not merely
a guerilla thing

721
01:17:56,555 --> 01:18:00,889
But to raise it to a strategical level

722
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:04,054
is really something new

723
01:18:04,796 --> 01:18:07,287
l'm a veteran armyman

724
01:18:08,367 --> 01:18:10,597
l never care about

725
01:18:10,635 --> 01:18:13,536
the origin of a certain fighting method

726
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:16,100
What do you care then?

727
01:18:16,141 --> 01:18:18,006
l care if it works or not

728
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:22,341
lf it works, it is a good one

729
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:35,354
Salute!

730
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:45,636
This is Cui, head of local guerrillas

731
01:18:48,907 --> 01:18:52,035
What military school are you from?

732
01:18:52,244 --> 01:18:55,736
Sir, l have never studied
l like 'Generals of the Yang's'

733
01:18:55,781 --> 01:18:57,476
l've enjoyed playing with spears

734
01:18:57,516 --> 01:18:59,575
When the Japs came
l just do as what l played

735
01:18:59,618 --> 01:19:02,485
to fight with the devils, finished

736
01:19:04,890 --> 01:19:06,585
'Generals of the Yang's'?

737
01:19:07,559 --> 01:19:09,424
you militia can fight with the devils?

738
01:19:10,429 --> 01:19:12,021
lf you civilians can fight

739
01:19:12,063 --> 01:19:14,054
what are we armymen supposed to do?

740
01:19:17,736 --> 01:19:20,170
lf all the ordinary people can fight

741
01:19:20,205 --> 01:19:22,264
can the Japs stay here long?

742
01:19:24,075 --> 01:19:27,374
Cui, just show them some of your trophies

743
01:19:27,412 --> 01:19:28,310
Yes, sir

744
01:19:29,481 --> 01:19:32,006
Even more than
we professionals have captured

745
01:19:32,050 --> 01:19:33,039
That's true

746
01:19:44,129 --> 01:19:45,323
Guerilla

747
01:19:48,533 --> 01:19:52,230
lt really has a tactic of wasps

748
01:19:52,504 --> 01:19:54,904
They only sting
the stupid horse of Japanese army

749
01:19:55,307 --> 01:19:57,673
its ass, its ears

750
01:19:58,610 --> 01:20:00,544
and even its penis

751
01:20:03,114 --> 01:20:07,744
Ok, you can pick up trophies for your own

752
01:20:08,420 --> 01:20:11,583
They're gifts from Commander Zhu for you

753
01:20:12,757 --> 01:20:14,952
This is a Japanese sword

754
01:20:14,993 --> 01:20:16,255
That's a 38' rifle

755
01:20:19,264 --> 01:20:20,526
Commander-in-chief Wei

756
01:20:22,634 --> 01:20:24,693
Do you know what l want most?

757
01:20:25,604 --> 01:20:29,040
A group of commissars from 8th Route Army

758
01:20:31,142 --> 01:20:31,801
Ok

759
01:20:34,045 --> 01:20:37,344
The scrap iron
is donated by the local people

760
01:20:37,382 --> 01:20:40,715
Some women and kids even carried it here

761
01:20:41,453 --> 01:20:42,579
lt's really hard for them

762
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:46,486
Those are from troops to be repaired

763
01:20:46,892 --> 01:20:48,621
Some are from 129th Division

764
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,190
Good...

765
01:20:53,632 --> 01:20:55,691
We captured these mortars

766
01:20:55,734 --> 01:20:57,634
at the Xiangtangpu Campaign

767
01:20:57,769 --> 01:21:00,203
They're still in good condition

768
01:21:01,239 --> 01:21:03,298
Can we make them?

769
01:21:03,341 --> 01:21:06,333
No problem, we've got engineers

770
01:21:06,378 --> 01:21:09,404
old workers and students from Beijing

771
01:21:09,447 --> 01:21:10,744
No problem at all

772
01:21:11,349 --> 01:21:12,338
Wonderful

773
01:21:14,219 --> 01:21:17,814
Let's invite Commander-in-chief
to give us a speech

774
01:21:27,299 --> 01:21:29,324
Thanks, comrades

775
01:21:29,801 --> 01:21:33,737
l'd like to thank you
on behalf of all the soldiers

776
01:21:34,706 --> 01:21:37,368
With your wisdom and labor

777
01:21:37,409 --> 01:21:41,175
with the local people as our backing

778
01:21:41,212 --> 01:21:45,080
we'll win the people's war for sure

779
01:21:51,556 --> 01:21:55,515
You know lyrics of 'Song of Guerillas'?

780
01:21:56,895 --> 01:21:59,762
No guns, no cannons

781
01:22:00,398 --> 01:22:02,866
Our enemy will make for us

782
01:22:03,969 --> 01:22:07,496
We'll not only take what they made

783
01:22:07,539 --> 01:22:09,939
but also make them ourselves

784
01:22:10,442 --> 01:22:14,401
To achieve the final victory

785
01:22:14,446 --> 01:22:18,439
spears and swords are not enough

786
01:22:18,883 --> 01:22:23,582
landmines and grenades are not enough

787
01:22:23,622 --> 01:22:26,591
we have to make guns and cannons

788
01:22:26,625 --> 01:22:31,324
even planes and warships

789
01:22:31,529 --> 01:22:36,626
Bravo!

790
01:22:52,150 --> 01:22:53,617
Lieutenant General!

791
01:22:53,985 --> 01:22:57,443
We actually first met each other

792
01:22:57,489 --> 01:23:03,359
at a parade of 8th Division, is that so?

793
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:07,491
Yes, l was Commander of 32nd Company

794
01:23:07,532 --> 01:23:11,127
of 16th Regiment of 8th Division
l was a Captain

795
01:23:11,870 --> 01:23:18,469
Only two years passed
and you are a lieutenant general

796
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:28,546
This is peerless in the lmperial Army

797
01:23:29,054 --> 01:23:32,023
The credit goes to His Majesty Mikado

798
01:23:33,391 --> 01:23:38,795
l'm very honored to have you

799
01:23:38,830 --> 01:23:43,028
Senior General Hisaichi here

800
01:23:44,402 --> 01:23:48,338
l'd like to express our gratitude

801
01:23:50,942 --> 01:23:58,474
and wish Abe a sweeping victory

802
01:24:00,518 --> 01:24:01,485
Thanks

803
01:24:01,653 --> 01:24:05,350
Please prove that
you're the pride of Japan

804
01:24:06,157 --> 01:24:07,283
l understand

805
01:24:07,759 --> 01:24:09,624
This is my super honor

806
01:24:10,562 --> 01:24:12,553
The honeymoon between KMT and CPC

807
01:24:12,597 --> 01:24:15,464
against us is over

808
01:24:15,633 --> 01:24:20,127
This is very helpful to lmperial Army

809
01:24:20,171 --> 01:24:28,078
Abe is about to attack
Nie Rongzhen's troops

810
01:24:28,113 --> 01:24:32,948
l wish you success

811
01:24:34,119 --> 01:24:36,781
Cheers Cheers...

812
01:24:38,456 --> 01:24:41,948
At 6th Session of 6th Conference of CPC

813
01:24:41,993 --> 01:24:44,461
Comrade Mao Zedong's leadership
in the Party

814
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:46,191
has been reaffirmed

815
01:24:46,498 --> 01:24:47,829
The Central Committee praised

816
01:24:47,866 --> 01:24:51,233
8th Route Army
for its resistance against Japan

817
01:24:52,403 --> 01:24:53,870
Come on it and sit

818
01:24:57,575 --> 01:25:01,067
The session also made strategic plans

819
01:25:01,112 --> 01:25:05,412
of gaining the leadership of resistance

820
01:25:05,817 --> 01:25:06,749
Comrades

821
01:25:06,785 --> 01:25:11,722
the Committee ordered
to arouse the local people

822
01:25:11,756 --> 01:25:13,986
and start up guerilla wars
against the Japs

823
01:25:14,793 --> 01:25:18,593
A brand new phase is about to come

824
01:25:19,130 --> 01:25:22,531
CPC must bear the whole country in mind

825
01:25:22,567 --> 01:25:25,832
Mao Zedong asked
the whole Party to be alert

826
01:25:26,271 --> 01:25:28,432
United front doesn't mean solidarity only

827
01:25:28,473 --> 01:25:31,067
Struggle is equally important

828
01:25:31,476 --> 01:25:34,741
We must be ready for
KMT's anti-Communist attacks

829
01:25:36,147 --> 01:25:38,945
Hidenori Abe of Japanese army in Mongolia

830
01:25:39,284 --> 01:25:40,649
has been transferred to Hebei

831
01:25:41,519 --> 01:25:44,613
He's the mountain warfare expert

832
01:25:53,965 --> 01:25:55,694
Stop

833
01:25:58,870 --> 01:26:02,067
Buried there are 500 of our soldiers

834
01:26:02,106 --> 01:26:06,236
who were ambushed and killed
in an encounter

835
01:26:50,889 --> 01:26:56,486
Cremate the bodies
and take the ashes with us

836
01:27:01,299 --> 01:27:03,859
The guerilla thing of Zhu and Mao

837
01:27:04,535 --> 01:27:07,629
won't work with me

838
01:27:08,406 --> 01:27:13,105
l'll deal with you the same way

839
01:27:13,144 --> 01:27:15,135
as they deal with us

840
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:22,110
You just swallow the bait

841
01:27:26,591 --> 01:27:27,148
Get rid of him

842
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:22,543
Only days ago he got promoted

843
01:28:22,580 --> 01:28:25,140
Now he's attacking the heart of our base

844
01:28:25,183 --> 01:28:26,673
He's really ambitious

845
01:28:26,951 --> 01:28:29,283
The Japs got assistance

846
01:28:29,988 --> 01:28:33,947
Zhu Huaibing's attacking our base
in northern Hebei

847
01:28:33,992 --> 01:28:39,123
Sun Chu's attacking our Suicide Team
in southern Shanxi

848
01:28:40,365 --> 01:28:42,993
Yan Xishan befriended the Japs

849
01:28:43,534 --> 01:28:46,162
A Japanese called Kawada Daisaku

850
01:28:46,237 --> 01:28:48,705
was a senior staff officer
in Guandong Army

851
01:28:49,307 --> 01:28:53,835
Now he is head of
Shanxi lndustry Co., Ltd

852
01:28:56,381 --> 01:28:59,407
He is colluding closely with Yan

853
01:29:00,852 --> 01:29:04,686
Chiang's also manipulating forces

854
01:29:04,722 --> 01:29:06,690
to attack our bases in Yan'an

855
01:29:07,925 --> 01:29:11,258
We're under attack from both sides

856
01:29:12,463 --> 01:29:14,829
Go and rest early

857
01:29:14,866 --> 01:29:16,390
Right

858
01:29:16,534 --> 01:29:17,831
Ok, you too

859
01:29:45,163 --> 01:29:46,391
Who is this?

860
01:29:49,667 --> 01:29:50,656
Commander-in-chief

861
01:29:57,108 --> 01:29:58,336
lt's frozen

862
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:02,006
Warm it up

863
01:30:03,314 --> 01:30:05,578
Where are you from? Wutai

864
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:08,516
Sorry, Yan Xishan is also from there

865
01:30:08,753 --> 01:30:10,778
What's there to be sorry for?

866
01:30:11,122 --> 01:30:14,387
Xu Xiangqian
Vice Commander of 129th Division

867
01:30:14,425 --> 01:30:15,790
is also from that place

868
01:30:17,462 --> 01:30:18,326
l'm no match to him

869
01:30:18,629 --> 01:30:19,823
When did you join the army?

870
01:30:20,264 --> 01:30:21,526
Just two months ago

871
01:30:23,835 --> 01:30:25,325
At Nanru Village

872
01:30:25,703 --> 01:30:28,263
Yes, when our HQs were in our village

873
01:30:37,281 --> 01:30:38,612
Cold?

874
01:30:43,321 --> 01:30:44,413
Better now?

875
01:30:46,724 --> 01:30:49,522
Go and run for awhile

876
01:30:50,394 --> 01:30:51,986
No, l have to stand guard

877
01:30:52,196 --> 01:30:53,686
l'll do it for you

878
01:30:54,932 --> 01:30:58,390
Go ahead

879
01:31:25,730 --> 01:31:30,224
Horses are marching along the mountains

880
01:31:32,870 --> 01:31:37,864
ln October it is snowing on the mountains

881
01:31:40,311 --> 01:31:44,645
Soldiers are thinly clad

882
01:31:46,817 --> 01:31:53,052
They eliminate the Japs day and night

883
01:32:01,199 --> 01:32:03,895
We can't wait for them to shoot at us
can we?

884
01:32:04,902 --> 01:32:06,529
They're not Japanese after all

885
01:32:07,071 --> 01:32:08,902
We must be patient now

886
01:32:09,340 --> 01:32:11,205
and won't shoot before they do

887
01:32:11,275 --> 01:32:13,004
Zhu Huaibing is here

888
01:32:24,488 --> 01:32:25,284
Show him in

889
01:32:30,761 --> 01:32:32,058
Please

890
01:32:36,267 --> 01:32:38,497
Commander Zhu, please sit down

891
01:32:41,205 --> 01:32:44,936
l'm not here for no reasons

892
01:32:44,976 --> 01:32:47,536
l'm here for getting Jinzhou back

893
01:32:50,815 --> 01:32:54,649
We're also fighting the Japs at the order

894
01:32:54,685 --> 01:32:56,380
of the Generalissimo

895
01:32:56,787 --> 01:32:59,722
We never borrowed this place from anyone

896
01:33:01,692 --> 01:33:03,182
How can we return it?

897
01:33:06,230 --> 01:33:10,360
l'm also following the orders of Chiang

898
01:33:10,401 --> 01:33:13,302
to combine military
and governmental systems

899
01:33:14,005 --> 01:33:18,135
l can't give away my territory
l have to get it back

900
01:33:18,175 --> 01:33:19,301
Good

901
01:33:20,378 --> 01:33:23,836
30 kms away is the Japanese occupied area

902
01:33:24,482 --> 01:33:27,315
lf you resolve to get it back

903
01:33:28,152 --> 01:33:31,280
we'll assist you at all costs

904
01:33:34,125 --> 01:33:38,926
This place used to belong to 97th Army

905
01:33:40,131 --> 01:33:43,396
l'll do anything to get it back

906
01:33:44,302 --> 01:33:50,241
For the sake of
overall resistance situation

907
01:33:51,776 --> 01:33:54,973
you'd better do anything

908
01:33:56,847 --> 01:33:58,542
that'll please the Japs

909
01:34:01,085 --> 01:34:02,916
Save the crap

910
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:08,321
There're only two options for you now

911
01:34:11,796 --> 01:34:14,856
To leave

912
01:34:16,434 --> 01:34:18,368
or to fight

913
01:34:19,670 --> 01:34:23,003
We'll never leave our resistance base

914
01:34:24,608 --> 01:34:26,872
To fight is your choice then?

915
01:34:26,911 --> 01:34:29,141
Should someone insist

916
01:34:29,180 --> 01:34:32,149
l'll be with him to the very end

917
01:34:32,216 --> 01:34:35,242
Aren't you afraid that

918
01:34:35,286 --> 01:34:37,516
your United Front policy will be wrecked?

919
01:34:37,922 --> 01:34:41,915
Eliminating those national traitors

920
01:34:43,394 --> 01:34:47,228
our United Front policy
can be better carried out

921
01:34:48,866 --> 01:34:50,493
l'll see you on the battlefield

922
01:34:51,802 --> 01:34:52,826
Stop

923
01:34:54,038 --> 01:34:55,005
What do you want?

924
01:34:55,039 --> 01:34:57,507
You were talking to
Vice Commander of 2nd Theater

925
01:34:57,541 --> 01:34:59,202
also Commander of East Route Army

926
01:34:59,243 --> 01:35:00,835
your direct superior

927
01:35:01,212 --> 01:35:04,045
You don't even know basic army protocols

928
01:35:04,081 --> 01:35:05,343
Aren't ashamed of yourself?

929
01:35:20,798 --> 01:35:22,789
Even a pawn dares to checkmate

930
01:35:22,833 --> 01:35:25,825
Because it is backed up by its king

931
01:35:31,776 --> 01:35:34,574
Tell His Excellency Hisaichi

932
01:35:35,379 --> 01:35:39,782
l've lured Nie Rongzhen's men
to Huangtuling

933
01:35:40,885 --> 01:35:44,548
Please urge 26th, 1 10th Divisions

934
01:35:44,588 --> 01:35:49,321
and 8th Brigade to rush there
and eliminate them

935
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:52,420
We can't afford to lose the chance

936
01:35:55,299 --> 01:35:57,028
Sir

937
01:35:59,403 --> 01:36:01,871
we captured a Communist spy

938
01:36:03,207 --> 01:36:04,367
That's unusual

939
01:36:05,476 --> 01:36:07,239
Sir

940
01:36:07,411 --> 01:36:09,140
l'm Miki Kimura, a private with

941
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:13,446
3rd Squad of 2nd Platoon
under Captain Tsujimura

942
01:36:13,484 --> 01:36:14,678
Nonsense!

943
01:36:15,419 --> 01:36:18,786
Tsujimura's troops died for our country

944
01:36:18,823 --> 01:36:21,792
No, all of the POWs joined the League

945
01:36:21,826 --> 01:36:27,492
of Antiwar of Japanese Army Soldiers

946
01:36:27,865 --> 01:36:30,925
But l insisted to come back

947
01:36:32,837 --> 01:36:34,498
You're a real armyman

948
01:36:35,506 --> 01:36:38,373
Do you want to go back to your platoon?

949
01:36:38,409 --> 01:36:40,934
l...

950
01:36:42,246 --> 01:36:43,508
Speak out

951
01:36:44,381 --> 01:36:47,646
l want to go home

952
01:36:49,954 --> 01:36:51,615
Home?

953
01:36:53,324 --> 01:36:55,019
Where are you from?

954
01:36:56,327 --> 01:37:00,593
A small village at the foot of Mt. Fuji

955
01:37:01,799 --> 01:37:08,261
You came here just to go back home

956
01:37:10,508 --> 01:37:14,672
Ok, you'll be gratified so that

957
01:37:15,980 --> 01:37:19,211
our hero can propagate
patriotism back home

958
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:22,947
Thank you, sir

959
01:37:32,129 --> 01:37:36,566
l'll leave the damned Mt Taihang at last

960
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:38,033
Stop

961
01:37:43,307 --> 01:37:44,831
What did you say?

962
01:37:45,276 --> 01:37:48,302
My home is at the foot of Mt. Fuji

963
01:37:48,812 --> 01:37:52,612
Why come to Mt. Taihang in China?

964
01:37:54,718 --> 01:37:57,278
No, l...

965
01:37:58,122 --> 01:37:59,555
Ok

966
01:38:00,391 --> 01:38:02,723
l'll pardon you for your baby act

967
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:07,319
and send you home for family reunion

968
01:38:07,765 --> 01:38:10,825
Thank you, sir

969
01:38:11,001 --> 01:38:17,634
l mean your bone ashes will be taken back

970
01:38:17,675 --> 01:38:19,404
Your family will be given
special treatment

971
01:38:19,443 --> 01:38:22,003
since you'll be in the roll of honor

972
01:38:22,046 --> 01:38:24,480
No, sir

973
01:38:24,515 --> 01:38:26,949
Take him away Yes, sir

974
01:38:27,718 --> 01:38:30,710
Lieutenant General...

975
01:38:43,367 --> 01:38:46,734
8th Route Army spared me

976
01:38:47,338 --> 01:38:49,636
but the lmperial Army won't

977
01:38:50,874 --> 01:38:56,608
Your Majesty, the lmperial Army is doomed

978
01:38:58,349 --> 01:39:03,150
This war is abosolutely wrong
it makes no sense

979
01:39:11,395 --> 01:39:14,091
Mom

980
01:39:21,939 --> 01:39:23,372
Why?

981
01:39:23,807 --> 01:39:26,367
Why is that?

982
01:39:27,077 --> 01:39:28,942
As a Japanese

983
01:39:28,979 --> 01:39:31,948
edified by imperialism for so many years

984
01:39:32,583 --> 01:39:34,551
How come in just a few days

985
01:39:34,585 --> 01:39:39,784
you've been brainwashed by
Communist propaganda?

986
01:39:41,325 --> 01:39:43,156
Why the hell is that?

987
01:39:47,464 --> 01:39:50,092
Emergent telegram from Chiang
Read it

988
01:39:50,768 --> 01:39:53,430
We are ordered to retreat
to east of Bai-Jin

989
01:39:55,839 --> 01:39:58,000
Major KMT forces are moving towards us

990
01:40:00,544 --> 01:40:04,674
ls Chiang helping the Japs
or the Japs helping Chiang?

991
01:40:04,715 --> 01:40:07,275
This isn't an ordinary military struggle

992
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:10,482
Defeating Abe

993
01:40:11,188 --> 01:40:14,954
can stimulate the morale of the Chinese

994
01:40:16,226 --> 01:40:19,821
Defeating KMT's anti-Communist troops

995
01:40:20,531 --> 01:40:25,867
will force Yan Xishan to hang on

996
01:40:26,003 --> 01:40:29,063
Chiang's got a merit

997
01:40:29,106 --> 01:40:32,075
lf you win, he will learn the lesson

998
01:40:34,044 --> 01:40:36,444
We're not artists after all

999
01:40:36,847 --> 01:40:40,180
Chairman Mao's theory of justification

1000
01:40:40,718 --> 01:40:42,242
is the art of struggle

1001
01:40:42,886 --> 01:40:44,513
We'll never shoot first

1002
01:40:44,955 --> 01:40:48,652
But if he does
we won't let him go easily

1003
01:40:48,692 --> 01:40:51,354
Frictions... always frictions

1004
01:40:51,829 --> 01:40:53,660
Get rid of him once all

1005
01:40:53,697 --> 01:40:55,062
then he won't bother us anymore

1006
01:40:57,034 --> 01:41:00,060
Counterattacking Zhu Huaibing
is a political fight

1007
01:41:01,038 --> 01:41:03,131
Commissar Deng'll be in charge

1008
01:41:16,787 --> 01:41:17,481
lt's a go!

1009
01:41:18,155 --> 01:41:19,122
lt's a go!

1010
01:41:22,192 --> 01:41:23,284
Counterattack now!

1011
01:41:43,814 --> 01:41:47,648
We've besieged
Zhu Huaibing's army command

1012
01:41:47,684 --> 01:41:50,448
What shall we do with him?

1013
01:41:50,687 --> 01:41:54,714
First, don't kill him

1014
01:41:55,559 --> 01:41:57,993
Second, don't capture him

1015
01:41:58,462 --> 01:42:00,692
Third, escort him out of our base

1016
01:42:00,998 --> 01:42:02,226
Violators will be executed

1017
01:42:03,667 --> 01:42:06,465
Fourth, make it clear to everyone

1018
01:42:06,937 --> 01:42:09,929
No retaliation what so ever

1019
01:42:11,341 --> 01:42:12,808
Violators will be executed

1020
01:42:18,248 --> 01:42:19,408
Halt!

1021
01:42:23,921 --> 01:42:25,718
Left and right turn!

1022
01:42:26,623 --> 01:42:28,488
Dress left and right, dress!

1023
01:42:31,028 --> 01:42:32,518
Eyes front!

1024
01:42:39,803 --> 01:42:44,172
Sir, under orders of
Vice Commander-in-chief Zhu

1025
01:42:44,208 --> 01:42:47,109
we're here to escort you out

1026
01:43:11,635 --> 01:43:16,766
You're Cui...

1027
01:43:16,807 --> 01:43:18,001
Cui Erdan

1028
01:43:19,710 --> 01:43:22,474
Director, Commander Cui

1029
01:43:23,247 --> 01:43:27,308
l'm honored...

1030
01:43:29,953 --> 01:43:31,147
Salute!

1031
01:44:27,678 --> 01:44:30,738
Sir, we failed to crush the Suicide Team

1032
01:44:41,525 --> 01:44:45,086
Wei Lihuang didn't help at all

1033
01:44:46,229 --> 01:44:47,457
A letter from Mao Zedong

1034
01:45:06,183 --> 01:45:07,275
Read it

1035
01:45:08,018 --> 01:45:10,543
lt's his personal letter

1036
01:45:11,088 --> 01:45:17,152
He hopes the conflict in Shanxi
be resolved peacefully

1037
01:45:19,796 --> 01:45:23,857
CPC sincerely wants to
fight against the Japs

1038
01:45:24,901 --> 01:45:27,062
not here to expand their domain

1039
01:45:28,572 --> 01:45:30,506
What about the telegram from the Japs?

1040
01:45:33,176 --> 01:45:34,438
Keep it

1041
01:45:35,379 --> 01:45:39,440
lf the resistance fails
Shanxi'll belong to the Japs

1042
01:45:40,484 --> 01:45:45,148
lf we win, it'll be taken by KMT

1043
01:45:46,590 --> 01:45:50,720
Chiang, the Communists, Japan

1044
01:45:50,761 --> 01:45:52,729
they're all troublesome

1045
01:45:53,697 --> 01:45:58,498
l'm dancing on three eggs

1046
01:45:58,535 --> 01:46:00,435
None of them can be broken

1047
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:04,901
Really tough

1048
01:46:25,829 --> 01:46:27,091
My friend

1049
01:46:27,264 --> 01:46:31,200
Chiang appointed me
to be the chief negotiator

1050
01:46:31,234 --> 01:46:33,134
the most important reason is that

1051
01:46:33,170 --> 01:46:35,661
he thinks we are personal friends

1052
01:46:37,207 --> 01:46:40,472
But l told him the Communists

1053
01:46:41,244 --> 01:46:43,712
care nothing about personal friendship

1054
01:46:43,814 --> 01:46:45,179
No...

1055
01:46:45,215 --> 01:46:48,116
we are not heartless and ungrateful

1056
01:46:49,219 --> 01:46:52,711
l like to be direct

1057
01:46:53,690 --> 01:46:57,091
Now the justice is on your side

1058
01:46:57,494 --> 01:47:01,396
l have to beg you not to
let me go back empty-handed

1059
01:47:01,431 --> 01:47:03,831
At least some sort of fruit

1060
01:47:03,867 --> 01:47:05,892
l know you're telling the truth

1061
01:47:07,637 --> 01:47:11,539
l'll be equally sincere

1062
01:47:12,909 --> 01:47:13,898
The map

1063
01:47:20,050 --> 01:47:24,180
ls this map of garrisons
of both sides accurate?

1064
01:47:29,459 --> 01:47:30,721
Very accurate

1065
01:47:33,897 --> 01:47:37,958
The road from Linfen and Tunliu

1066
01:47:38,401 --> 01:47:42,770
all the way to Changzhi
Pingshun and Cixian

1067
01:47:42,806 --> 01:47:44,273
will be our boundary

1068
01:47:46,109 --> 01:47:47,838
Please say it again

1069
01:47:48,912 --> 01:47:53,747
Along Linfen, Tunliu, Changzhi, Pingshun

1070
01:47:53,783 --> 01:47:55,910
and Cixian, we can draw a line

1071
01:47:56,419 --> 01:48:00,116
all our men south of it
will be withdrawn to its north

1072
01:48:01,224 --> 01:48:03,089
You said all of your troops?

1073
01:48:03,126 --> 01:48:04,286
Exactly

1074
01:48:04,961 --> 01:48:07,589
You won't even keep a bridgehead?

1075
01:48:07,964 --> 01:48:11,331
Not a single one

1076
01:48:11,968 --> 01:48:13,128
And you're asking for?

1077
01:48:13,537 --> 01:48:14,731
Only one thing

1078
01:48:15,338 --> 01:48:18,273
Don't overstep it to pick quarrels

1079
01:48:18,575 --> 01:48:21,009
Resistance is more important

1080
01:48:22,145 --> 01:48:23,203
My friend

1081
01:48:23,480 --> 01:48:26,472
so now our negotiation is finished?

1082
01:48:26,516 --> 01:48:27,540
Finished

1083
01:48:27,784 --> 01:48:28,944
Do you mean it?

1084
01:48:29,853 --> 01:48:31,184
l mean it

1085
01:48:48,138 --> 01:48:49,162
Commander-in-chief

1086
01:48:49,506 --> 01:48:53,101
Zhu De is a victor
how come he gives away his territory?

1087
01:48:54,611 --> 01:48:58,547
He's benevolent and uprighteous

1088
01:49:04,521 --> 01:49:07,046
Telegram from Nie Rongzhen Ok

1089
01:49:10,927 --> 01:49:12,986
Local farmers at Huangtuling said

1090
01:49:13,029 --> 01:49:16,089
a Japanese general was spotted over there

1091
01:49:16,566 --> 01:49:18,534
Something big

1092
01:49:18,735 --> 01:49:20,965
lt's so nice of the local people

1093
01:49:21,104 --> 01:49:25,006
Our way is to rely on the people

1094
01:49:25,475 --> 01:49:29,434
This advantage can never be copied
by our rivals

1095
01:49:29,579 --> 01:49:30,773
Remind Nie Rongzhen

1096
01:49:31,214 --> 01:49:34,411
to use all his men and power as well

1097
01:49:34,718 --> 01:49:36,652
They've got captured mortars

1098
01:49:36,686 --> 01:49:39,052
and what HQs sent them, enough

1099
01:50:23,300 --> 01:50:25,894
107... it's a big fish

1100
01:50:26,436 --> 01:50:27,494
107 roger

1101
01:50:52,629 --> 01:50:55,564
The guy dares to stare at me

1102
01:50:55,899 --> 01:50:56,888
Get rid of him

1103
01:51:00,337 --> 01:51:02,362
Front left, 793 Height

01:51:07,444 --> 01:51:11,073
Front left
793 Height is 8th Route Army's command

1105
01:51:11,448 --> 01:51:13,143
Fire! Yes, sir!

1106
01:51:14,050 --> 01:51:19,784
Get ready!

1107
01:51:22,992 --> 01:51:24,755
Sir, we're all set

1108
01:51:25,261 --> 01:51:26,057
OK

1109
01:51:27,297 --> 01:51:34,032
All mortars, get ready, fire!

1110
01:52:21,217 --> 01:52:26,314
East...

1111
01:52:35,031 --> 01:52:45,874
'Asahi Shinbun': The Flower of
a General Withered on Mt. Taihang

1112
01:53:05,361 --> 01:53:07,261
May, 1940

1113
01:53:07,964 --> 01:53:11,263
l went back to Yan'an as ordered

1114
01:53:12,268 --> 01:53:14,668
Chairman Mao mentioned

1115
01:53:14,704 --> 01:53:18,196
a stubborn old man in ancient times
who removed Taihang

1116
01:53:18,241 --> 01:53:21,608
saying Commander-in-chief Zhu
is doing the same

1117
01:53:21,845 --> 01:53:24,143
l'm not that capable

1118
01:53:25,615 --> 01:53:28,743
Since September 1937

1119
01:53:28,785 --> 01:53:33,688
when we crossed the Yellow River

1120
01:53:34,023 --> 01:53:35,991
2 years and 8 months have passed

1121
01:53:37,660 --> 01:53:39,719
We've annihilated
1 30,000 Japanese soldiers

1122
01:53:40,396 --> 01:53:43,490
while our own army has been expanding

1123
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:47,531
and has created a situation of stalemate
in North China

1124
01:53:50,540 --> 01:53:51,768
What are the secrets?

1125
01:53:52,542 --> 01:53:54,339
First, we relied on
Mao's military strategy thoughts

1126
01:53:55,111 --> 01:53:57,579
Second, we relied on
3 divisions of 8th Route Army

1127
01:53:58,681 --> 01:54:02,276
Third, we relied on
the local people of Mt. Taihang

1128
01:54:11,160 --> 01:54:13,993
Chairman Mao also expected you to

1129
01:54:14,030 --> 01:54:17,022
go back
for the 7th National Party Congress

1130
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:21,696
and to take care of
national military work in Yan'an

1131
01:54:24,908 --> 01:54:26,375
l miss...

1132
01:54:27,710 --> 01:54:30,178
l miss Mt.Taihang very much

1133
01:54:33,816 --> 01:54:39,118
Half of my life l'd been engaged in wars
but all civil wars

1134
01:54:40,757 --> 01:54:46,195
only to fight against invaders
in the last two years

1135
01:54:48,531 --> 01:54:55,061
lt's the responsibility of
a veteran soldier to our nation
