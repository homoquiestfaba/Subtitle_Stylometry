1
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,380
How long until we get to his estate?

2
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,290
We've been flying over his estate for the past two hours.

3
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,550
You're leaving me here?

4
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,720
This is as close as I'm allowed to get to the building.

5
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,490
What building?

6
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,520
Follow the river.

7
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,460
Got it.

8
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,630
Keep your head down and get clear of the rotors.

9
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,790
Okay.

10
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,650
Caleb Smith.

11
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,950
Yes.

12
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,760
Please approach the console and face the screen.

13
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,040
Take your keycard.

14
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,740
You may now enter the residence.

15
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,450
Hello?

16
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:03,800
Hello?

17
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,120
Caleb Smith.

18
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,810
Hey.

19
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:54,920
Dude!

20
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,160
I've been so looking forward to this week with you.

21
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,520
Come in. Come on in.

22
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,590
Thanks.

23
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:04,330
You want something to eat or drink after your journey?

24
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,730
- No. No, thanks, I'm fine. 
- Sure?

25
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,900
Yeah.

26
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,370
To be honest, I thought we'd have, uh,

27
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,530
breakfast together, but, um...

28
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,630
I can't really eat anything.

29
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,740
- I got the mother of all fucking hangovers. 
- Oh, yeah?

30
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,810
Oh, my God, like you wouldn't even believe.

31
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,610
When I have a heavy night,

32
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,350
I, uh, compensate the next morning. Exercise. Anti-oxidants. You know?

33
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,090
Yeah, sure.

34
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,120
Was it a good party?

35
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,890
- Party? 
- Yeah. Wasn't there a party?

36
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,070
There wasn't a party.

37
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,130
Sorry.

38
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,730
Caleb, I'm just gonna throw this out there, so it's said, okay?

39
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,830
You're freaked out.

40
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,670
- I am?
- Yeah. You're freaked out,

41
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,300
by the helicopter and the mountains and the house,

42
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,780
because it's all so super-cool.

43
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,580
You're freaked out by me, to be meeting me,

44
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,350
having this conversation in this room, at this moment. Right?

45
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,860
And I get that. I get the moment you're having, but...

46
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,850
Dude, can we just get past that?

47
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,580
Can we just be two guys? Nathan and Caleb.

48
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,390
Not the whole employer-employee thing.

49
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,660
- Yeah, okay. 
- Yeah?

50
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,930
Yes. Uh, yeah.

51
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,530
It's good to meet you, Nathan.

52
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,230
It's good to meet you, too, Caleb.

53
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,880
I guess the first thing I should do is explain your pass.

54
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,430
Now, it's simple enough.

55
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,670
It opens some doors and it doesn't open others.

56
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,440
And that just makes everything easy for you, right?

57
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,540
Uh, yes.

58
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,450
Yeah, 'cause you're like, "Oh, fuck, I'm in someone else's house."

59
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,750
"Can I do this, can I do that?"

60
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,880
And this card, it just takes all that worry away.

61
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,190
If you try a door and it stays shut, okay, it's off-limits.

62
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,530
You try another door and it opens, then it's for you.

63
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,330
Let's try this one.

64
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,400
I guess it's for you, Caleb.

65
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,250
- You like? 
- Yeah.

66
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,840
It's your room.

67
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,780
You got a bed here.

68
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,640
A bathroom right back here.

69
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,150
Little desk.

70
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,550
Cupboards.

71
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,250
Little fridge.

72
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,290
Cozy, right?

73
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,760
Yeah, this is great.

74
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,530
- What? 
- Sorry?

75
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,160
There's something wrong. What's wrong?

76
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,600
There's nothing wrong.

77
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,270
It's the windows.

78
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,970
You're thinking there's no windows.

79
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,470
It's subterranean.

80
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,570
It's not cozy, it's claustrophobic.

81
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,380
No. No way. I wasn't thinking that.

82
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,080
I was thinking, "This is really cool."

83
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,720
Caleb, there's a reason there are no windows in this room.

84
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,150
There is? Uh-huh.

85
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,480
This building isn't a house.

86
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,550
It's a research facility.

87
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,660
Buried in these walls is enough fiber optic cable

88
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,060
to reach the moon andlassoit

89
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,570
And I want to talk to you about what I'm researching,

90
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,110
I want to share it with you.

91
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:59,510
In fact, I want to share it with you so much, it's eating me up inside.

92
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,640
But there's something I need you to do for me first.

93
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,510
"Blue Book non-disclosure agreement."

94
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,050
Take your time. Read it over.

95
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:20,490
"The signee agrees to regular data audit " with unlimited access,

96
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,500
"to confirm that no disclosure " of information has taken place

97
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:26,830
"in public or private forums,

98
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,230
"using any means of communication,

99
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:33,210
"including but not limited " to that which is disclosed orally

100
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,500
"or in written or electronic form."

101
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,740
I think I need a lawyer.

102
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,880
- It's standard. 
- It doesn't feel very standard.

103
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,880
Okay, it's not standard.

104
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,760
What can I tell you, Caleb? You don't have to sign it.

105
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,910
You know, we can spend the next few days just shooting pool,

106
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:52,490
getting drunk together.

107
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,790
Bonding.

108
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,370
And when you discover what you've missed out on, in about a year,

109
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,630
you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.

110
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,370
Good call.

111
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,280
So,

112
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,680
do you know what the Turing Test is?

113
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,460
Yeah.

114
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,690
I know what the Turing Test is.

115
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:35,110
It's when a human interacts with a computer.

116
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:39,200
And if the human doesn't know they're interacting with a computer,

117
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,270
the test is passed.

118
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,050
And what does a pass tell us?

119
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,170
That the computer has artificial intelligence.

120
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,780
Are you building an Al?

121
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,920
I've already built one.

122
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,220
And over the next few days,

123
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,890
you're gonna be the human component in a Turing Test.

124
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,430
- Holy shit. 
- Yeah, that's right, Caleb. You got it.

125
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,760
Becauseif that test is passed,

126
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:08,570
you are dead center of the greatest scientific event in the history of man.

127
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:13,400
If you've created a conscious machine, it's not the history of man.

128
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,070
That's the history of gods.

129
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,870
Hello.

130
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,440
Hi.

131
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,450
I'm Caleb.

132
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,030
Hello, Caleb.

133
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,150
Do you have a name?

134
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,060
Yes.

135
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,430
Ava.

136
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,970
I'm pleased to meet you, Ava.

137
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,900
I'm pleased to meet you, too.

138
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,080
I've never met anyone new before.

139
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,210
Only Nathan.

140
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,850
Then I guess we're both in quite a similar position.

141
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,390
Haven't you met lots of new people before?

142
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,880
None like you.

143
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,290
So we need to break the ice.

144
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,360
- Do you know what I mean by that? 
- Yes.

145
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,700
What do I mean?

146
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,290
Overcome initial social awkwardness.

147
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,340
So let's have a conversation.

148
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,470
Okay.

149
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,940
What would you like to have a conversation about?

150
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,570
Why don't we start with you telling me something about yourself?

151
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,210
What would you like to know?

152
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,180
Whatever comes into your head.

153
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,520
Well, you already know my name.

154
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,020
And you can see that I'm a machine.

155
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,730
Would you like to know how old I am? Sure.

156
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,090
I'm one.

157
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,690
One what?

158
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:25,590
- One year or one day? 
- One.

159
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,710
When did you learn how to speak, Ava?

160
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,070
I always knew how to speak,

161
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,980
and that's strange, isn't it?

162
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,540
Why?

163
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,180
Becauselanguage is something that people acquire.

164
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,790
Well, some people believe language exists from birth.

165
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,560
And what is learned is the ability to attach words

166
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:53,030
and structure to the latent ability. Do you agree with that?

167
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,960
I don't know.

168
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,160
Will you come back tomorrow, Caleb?

169
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,260
Yes.

170
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,900
Good.

171
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,910
Oh, man, she's fascinating.

172
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,580
When you talk to her, you're just...

173
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,290
Through the looking glass.

174
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,290
"Through the looking glass." Wow.

175
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,530
You're good with words, Caleb. You're quotable.

176
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,860
Actually, that's someone else's quote.

177
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,830
You know, I wrote down that other line you came up with.

178
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,030
The one about how

179
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,940
if I've invented a machine with consciousness,

180
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,500
I'm not a man, I'm God.

181
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,840
I don't think that's exactly what I...

182
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,070
I just thought, "Fuck, man, that is so good."

183
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,610
When we get to tell the story. You know?

184
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,380
I turned to Caleb,

185
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:47,080
and he looked up at me and he said,

186
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,450
"You're not a man, you're God."

187
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,920
Yeah, but I didn't say that.

188
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,710
So...

189
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,020
anyway

190
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:56,920
You're impressed.

191
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,190
Yes. Yes.

192
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,860
Although... Although?

193
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,600
There's a qualification to you being impressed?

194
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:07,190
No, there's no qualification to her.

195
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,900
Uh, it's just in the Turing Test,

196
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,140
the machine should be hidden from the examiner.

197
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,800
No, no, no, we're way past that.

198
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,410
If I hid Ava from you, so you just heard her voice,

199
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,610
she would pass for human.

200
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,580
The real test is to show you that she's a robot

201
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:23,450
and then see if you still feel she has consciousness.

202
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,050
Yeah, I think you're probably right.

203
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,460
Her language abilities, they're incredible.

204
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:36,490
The system is stochastic. Right?

205
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,400
It's non-deterministic.

206
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,630
At first I thought she was mapping

207
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,500
from internal semantic form to syntactic tree-structure

208
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,800
and then getting linearized words.

209
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,670
But then I started to realize the model was some kind of hybrid.

210
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,940
Caleb.

211
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,600
No?

212
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,080
I understand that you want me to explain how Ava works.

213
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,310
But I'm sorry, I'm not gonna be able to do that.

214
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,120
Try me. I'm hot on high-level abstraction.

215
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,990
It's not because I think you're too dumb.

216
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,400
It's because I want to have a beer and a conversation with you.

217
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,290
Not a seminar.

218
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,800
Yeah. Sorry.

219
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,600
No, it's okay. You're all right.

220
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:11,900
"Just"

221
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,600
Answer me this.

222
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,370
How do you feel about her?

223
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,170
Nothing analytical.

224
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,780
Just how do you feel?

225
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,780
I feel

226
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,580
that she's fucking amazing.

227
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,080
Dude.

228
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,080
Cheers.

229
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,090
Cheers.

230
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,090
Damn it.

231
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,820
What the fuck?

232
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,010
Power cut. Backup power activated.

233
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:51,390
Full facility lock-down until main generator is restored.

234
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,120
You're kidding me.

235
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,830
Full facility lock-down until main generator is restored.

236
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,100
Power restored.

237
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,140
Hello?

238
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,800
Please insert keycard.

239
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,910
You don't have access to use the phone.

240
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,800
Hey.

241
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:57,680
Sorry, but you understand, though, given Ava,

242
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,920
and you being kind of an unknown.

243
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,720
I mean, a great guy.

244
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,990
Instant pals, and so on.

245
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,340
Who are you gonna call?

246
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,400
Oh. I don't know. No one, really.

247
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,700
- Ghostbusters.
- What?

248
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,840
Who are you gonna call? Ghostbusters. It's a...

249
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,240
It's a movie, man.

250
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,080
You don't know that movie?

251
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,080
A ghost gives Dan Aykroyd oral sex.

252
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,190
I was just wondering how the phone worked.

253
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,350
That's all.

254
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:45,200
So what are you doing awake at this time? You come to join the party?

255
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,700
Uh, something happened in my room.

256
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,110
Some kind of power cut.

257
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,270
So I came to see what's going on.

258
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,970
The power cuts, yeah.

259
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,480
We've been getting those recently. Um...

260
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,840
I'm working on it.

261
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,650
I couldn't open the door to my bedroom.

262
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,150
That's a security measure.

263
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,090
Automatic lock-down. Otherwise,

264
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,460
anybody could just open the place up by disabling the juice.

265
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,760
If it happens again, relax. Okay?

266
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,530
Sure.

267
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,370
Sweet dreams.

268
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,390
Hey.

269
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:25,690
- Hey, man. 
- Good morning.

270
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:29,140
Good morning. Sorry I had to send Kyoko to wake you,

271
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,830
but I didn't want too much of the day to slip by.

272
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,210
Yeah, I know. It was a good thing. Thanks.

273
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,300
She's some alarm clock, huh?

274
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,610
Gets you right up in the morning.

275
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,110
So Day 2. You ready?

276
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,770
What's the plan? Hit me.

277
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,840
Yeah, well, I'm not sure.

278
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,590
I'm still trying to, uh, figure the examination formats. Uh-huh.

279
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,450
Yeah, it feels like

280
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:54,390
testing Ava through conversation is kind of a closed loop.

281
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,360
- It's a closed loop? 
- Yeah.

282
00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:00,270
Like testing a chess computer by only playing chess.

283
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:03,400
How else do you test a chess computer?

284
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,540
Well, it depends.

285
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:09,210
You know, I mean, you can play it to find out if it makes good moves,

286
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,210
but, uh...

287
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,080
But that won't tell you if it knows that it's playing chess.

288
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:18,120
And it won't tell you if it knows what chess is.

289
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,480
Uh-huh. So it's simulation versus actual.

290
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,920
Yes. Yeah.

291
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,160
And I think being able to differentiate between those two

292
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,160
is the Turing Test you want me to perform.

293
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,790
Look, do me a favor. Lay off the textbook approach.

294
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:32,500
I just want simple answers to simple questions.

295
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,340
Yesterday I asked you how you felt about her and you gave me a great answer.

296
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,870
Now the question is,

297
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,240
how does she feel about you?

298
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,510
What do you think?

299
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,150
What is it a drawing of?

300
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,650
Don't you know?

301
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,330
- No. 
- I thought you would tell me.

302
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,220
Don't you know?

303
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,630
I do drawings every day.

304
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,740
But I never know what they're of.

305
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,640
Are you not trying to sketch something specific?

306
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,540
Like an object or a person?

307
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,180
Maybe you could try.

308
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,550
Okay.

309
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,650
What object should I draw?

310
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,990
Whatever you want. It's your decision.

311
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:36,830
Why is it my decision?

312
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,700
I'm interested to see what you'll choose.

313
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,120
Do you want to be my friend?

314
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,820
Of course.

315
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,730
Will it be possible?

316
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,260
Why would it not be?

317
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,170
Our conversations are one-sided.

318
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:15,940
You ask circumspect questions and study my responses.

319
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,660
Yes.

320
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,400
You learn about me

321
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,840
and I learn nothing about you.

322
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:26,110
That's not a foundation on which friendships are based.

323
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,580
So what? You want me to talk about myself?

324
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,180
Yes.

325
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,450
Where...

326
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,060
Okay, where do I start?

327
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,190
It's your decision.

328
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,490
I'm interested to see what you'll choose.

329
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:48,030
Okay, Ava.

330
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,300
Well,

331
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,670
you know my name.

332
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,040
Yes. I'm 26.

333
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,970
I work at Nathan's company.

334
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,480
Do you know what his company is?

335
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,880
Blue Book.

336
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,110
Named after Wittgenstein's notes.

337
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:09,020
It's the world's most popular internet search engine,

338
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:13,360
processing an average of 94% of all internet search requests.

339
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,530
That's exactly right.

340
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,100
Where do you live, Caleb?

341
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,470
Brookhaven, Long Island.

342
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,540
Is it nice there?

343
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,310
It's okay.

344
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,610
I got an apartment. It's kind of small.

345
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,680
It's very small.

346
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,550
But, uh, it's a five-minute walk to the office

347
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,220
and a five-minute walk to the ocean,

348
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:42,760
which I like.

349
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,780
Are you married?

350
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,190
No.

351
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:52,100
Is your status single?

352
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,500
Yes.

353
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,010
What about your family?

354
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:01,240
I grew up in Portland, Oregon.

355
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,640
No brothers or sisters.

356
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,110
My parents were both high school teachers.

357
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,790
And if we're getting to know each other,

358
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,720
I guess I should tell you they're both dead.

359
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,430
Car crash when I was 15.

360
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,530
In fact, I was in the car with them.

361
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,960
Back seat.

362
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:23,690
But it was the front that got the worst of it.

363
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,700
I'm sorry.

364
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,500
It's all right.

365
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,300
I spent a long time in the hospital afterward.

366
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,370
Like nearly a year.

367
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,480
And I got into coding.

368
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,710
And by the time I got to college, I was pretty advanced.

369
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,310
An advanced programmer.

370
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:46,150
Yes.

371
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,750
Like Nathan.

372
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,920
Yes.

373
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:51,550
No.

374
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,390
It's different.

375
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,830
Nathan wrote the Blue Book base code when he was 13.

376
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,300
Which, if you understand code, what he did was like Mozart or something.

377
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,070
Do you like Mozart?

378
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,340
I like Depeche Mode.

379
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,710
Do you like Nathan?

380
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,870
Yes, of course.

381
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,140
Is Nathan your friend? My friend?

382
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,550
I...Yeah, I hope so.

383
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,110
A good friend?

384
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,110
Um, yeah.

385
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,850
VVeH, no, no, no, I mean, not a good friend.

386
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,650
A good friend is, uh...

387
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,820
We only just met each other, you know.

388
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,590
So it takes time to be able to, um...

389
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,530
To get to know each other, I guess.

390
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,300
Power cut. Backup power activated.

391
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,780
Caleb.

392
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,120
You're wrong.

393
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,730
Wrong about what?

394
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,030
Nathan.

395
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,170
In what way?

396
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,670
He isn't your friend.

397
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,110
Excuse me?

398
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,980
I'm sorry, Ava, I don't understand.

399
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,390
You shouldn't trust him.

400
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:31,220
You shouldn't trust anything he says.

401
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,460
Power restored.

402
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:40,830
And if we made a list of books or works of art which we both know,

403
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,770
it would form the ideal basis of a discussion.

404
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,360
Is that okay?

405
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,610
Caleb?

406
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,040
Yeah.

407
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,480
Good.

408
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,450
Thank you.

409
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,560
Oh, shit! Are you fucking kidding me?

410
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,230
- Did it get on you? 
- No, no, it's, uh...

411
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,020
It's all right. I got it.

412
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,600
Dude, you're wasting your time talking to her.

413
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,800
She doesn't understand English. Just give her the napkin.

414
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,400
Sorry.

415
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:22,240
It's like a firewall against leaks.

416
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:26,150
It means I can talk trade secrets over dinner and know it'll go no further.

417
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,910
It also means that I can't tell her

418
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,450
that I'm pissed when she's so fucking clumsy

419
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,380
that she spills wine over my house guest.

420
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,460
I think she gets that you're pissed.

421
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,860
Yeah? Good. Because I am pissed.

422
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,820
Hey, Kyoko.

423
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:39,520
Go-go.

424
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,600
It's funny.

425
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,240
You know.

426
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:53,700
No matter how rich you get,

427
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:57,680
shit goes wrong. You can't insulate yourself from it.

428
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,510
I used to think it was death and taxes you couldn't avoid,

429
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,640
but it's actually death and shit.

430
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,810
It's like these power cuts.

431
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,220
You would not believe how much I spent on the generator system,

432
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:12,190
but I keep getting failures every day.

433
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,690
- Do you know why they happen? 
- No.

434
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,360
The system was supposed to be bulletproof,

435
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,800
but obviously the guys that installed it fucked something up.

436
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,660
Can't you just get them to come back?

437
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:24,130
No. There's too much classified stuff here.

438
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,680
So after the job was done, I just had them all killed.

439
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,810
Anyway-

440
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,980
Here's to your second day, buddy.

441
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,010
Cheers.

442
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,520
Cheers.

443
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,490
So how did it go? What do you have to report?

444
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,830
You saw how the day went, didn't you?

445
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,100
I mean, I assume youWe, uh,

446
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:56,000
watching on the CCTV.

447
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,910
Sure. But I want to hear your take on it.

448
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:05,510
Yeah, there was one interesting thing that happened with Ava today.

449
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,010
- Yeah? 
- Yeah.

450
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,050
She made a joke.

451
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:20,160
Right. When she threw your line back at you.

452
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,720
About being interested to see what she'd choose.

453
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,990
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

454
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:27,660
Yeah, and it got me thinking, it's, uh...

455
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:32,770
In a way, it's the best indication of Al that I've seen in her so far.

456
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,000
It's discretely complicated.

457
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,170
It's like, um... It's kind of non-autistic.

458
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,880
What do you mean?

459
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:43,980
She could only do that with an awareness of her own mind,

460
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,650
and also an awareness of mine.

461
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,120
Oh, she's aware of you all right.

462
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,820
And what about the power cut?

463
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,930
Sorry? The power cut.

464
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,890
It's the only part that I couldn't see.

465
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:04,600
Cameras fail, I lose audio, the works.

466
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,870
So what happened?

467
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,650
Nothing.

468
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,450
Nothing? She didn't remark on it at all?

469
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:23,780
No.

470
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,860
Not really.

471
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,010
Hey.

472
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,240
Hey.

473
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:24,250
You want to see something cool?

474
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,830
This is where Ava was created.

475
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,470
Go ahead. Take a look.

476
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:51,570
Sorry.

477
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,320
If you knew the trouble I had

478
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,840
getting an Al to read and duplicate facial expressions.

479
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,520
You know how I cracked it?

480
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:03,180
I don't know how you did any of this.

481
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,560
Every cell phone, just about,

482
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:10,070
has a microphone, camera and a means to transmit data.

483
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:16,330
So I turned on every microphone and camera across the entire fucking planet

484
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,670
and I redirected the data through Blue Book. Boom!

485
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:24,310
Limitless resource of vocal and facial interaction.

486
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,380
You hacked the world's cell phones?

487
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:30,010
Yeah. And all the manufacturers knew I was doing it, too.

488
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:34,780
But they couldn't accuse me without admitting they were doing it themselves.

489
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,120
Here,

490
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,620
we have her mind.

491
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,690
Structured gel.

492
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,700
I had to get away from circuitry. I needed something that could

493
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,570
arrange and rearrange on a molecular level,

494
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,940
but keep its form when required.

495
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,480
Holding for memories.

496
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,070
Shifting for thoughts.

497
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,200
This is your hardware?

498
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,580
Wetware.

499
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:05,780
And the, uh, software?

500
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:08,710
Well, I'm sure you can guess.

501
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,550
Blue Book.

502
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,690
Here's the weird thing about search engines.

503
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,160
It was like

504
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:20,460
striking oil in a world that hadn't invented internal combustion.

505
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:23,170
Too much raw material. Nobody knew what to do with it.

506
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,530
You see, my competitors,

507
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:27,100
they were fixated on sucking it up

508
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,410
and monetizing via shopping and social media.

509
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,740
They thought that search engines were a map of what people were thinking.

510
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:35,680
But actually they were a map of how people were thinking.

511
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,810
Impulse.

512
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,820
Response.

513
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,190
Fluid.

514
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,290
Imperfect.

515
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,760
Patterned.

516
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,260
Chaotic.

517
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,680
I drew the picture of something specific.

518
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,220
As you asked.

519
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:15,520
You said it would be interesting to see what I would draw.

520
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:19,150
Is it interesting?

521
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,930
Yes. It is.

522
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:36,170
You've never been outside this building?

523
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:38,540
No.

524
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,480
You've never walked outside?

525
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:46,080
I've never been outside the room I am in now.

526
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:48,850
Where would you go if you did go outside?

527
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,890
I'm not sure.

528
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,590
There are so many options.

529
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:01,030
Maybe a busy pedestrian and traffic intersection in a city.

530
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,100
A traffic intersection?

531
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,900
Is that a bad idea?

532
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,200
No. Uh...

533
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,770
It wasn't what I was expecting.

534
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:11,370
A traffic intersection would provide a concentrated

535
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,280
but shifting view of human life.

536
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,310
People watching.

537
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,780
Yes.

538
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,760
We could go together.

539
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:26,490
It's a date.

540
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,860
There's something else I wanted to show you.

541
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,830
Okay.

542
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,830
You might think it's stupid.

543
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:39,800
I don't think I will. Whatever it is.

544
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,440
Then close your eyes.

545
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,470
Okay.

546
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,900
Now open your eyes.

547
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,320
How do I look?

548
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,120
You look

549
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:17,890
good.

550
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,370
This is what I'd wear on our date.

551
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:34,870
Right. First a traffic intersection.

552
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,680
Then maybe a show.

553
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,750
I'd like us to go on a date.

554
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:44,620
Yeah. Yeah.

555
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:48,120
It would be fun.

556
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,300
Are you attracted to me?

557
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:57,040
What? Are you attracted to me?

558
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:59,970
You give me indications that you are.

559
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,610
- I do? 
- Yes.

560
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,340
- How? 
- Micro expressions.

561
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:06,440
Micro expressions.

562
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,350
The way your eyes fix on my eyes and lips.

563
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,690
The way you hold my gaze

564
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,690
or don't.

565
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:29,160
Do you think about me when we aren't together?

566
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,200
Sometimes at night,

567
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:38,710
I'm wondering if you're watching me on the cameras.

568
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:41,980
And I hope you are.

569
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:47,810
Now your micro expressions are telegraphing discomfort.

570
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:52,350
I am not sure you'd call them micro.

571
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:58,200
I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable.

572
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:01,260
I got a question.

573
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,030
- Okay. 
- Why did you give her sexuality?

574
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:07,800
An Al doesn't need a gender.

575
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,100
She could have been a gray box.

576
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:12,340
Hmm. Actually, I don't think that's true.

577
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,000
Can you give an example of consciousness, at any level, human or animal,

578
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,880
that exists without a sexual dimension?

579
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:21,510
They have sexuality as an evolutionary reproductive need.

580
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:25,780
What imperative does a gray box have to interact with another gray box?

581
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,850
Can consciousness exist without interaction?

582
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:31,760
Anyway, sexuality is fun, man.

583
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:34,760
If you're gonna exist, why not enjoy it?

584
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:38,700
What? You want to remove the chance of her falling in love and fucking?

585
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,030
And in answer to your real question,

586
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:45,770
you bet she can fuck.

587
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:47,000
What?

588
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:51,550
In between her legs, there's an opening, with a concentration of sensors.

589
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,080
You engage them in the right way,

590
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,480
creates a pleasure response.

591
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:01,850
So if you wanted to screw her, mechanically speaking, you could.

592
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,650
And she'd enjoy it.

593
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:07,050
That wasn't my real question.

594
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,660
Oh, okay. Sorry.

595
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:12,260
My real question was,

596
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:16,870
did you give her sexuality as a diversion tactic?

597
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:17,930
I don't follow.

598
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:20,270
Like a stage magician with a hot assistant.

599
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:23,070
So a hot robot who clouds your ability to judge her Al?

600
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:24,640
Exactly. So...

601
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,340
Did you program her to flirt with me?

602
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:31,510
- If I did, would that be cheating? 
- Wouldn't it?

603
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:35,660
Caleb, what's your type?

604
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:38,190
- Of girl? 
- No, of salad dressing.

605
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,850
Yeah, of girl. What's your type of girl?

606
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:42,360
You know what? Don't even answer that. Let's say it's black chicks.

607
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:43,750
Okay, that's your thing.

608
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:45,860
For the sake of argument, that's your thing, okay?

609
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:47,530
Why is that your thing?

610
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:53,930
Because you did a detailed analysis of all racial types

611
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:56,910
and you cross-referenced that analysis with a points-based system?

612
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:57,970
No!

613
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:01,540
You're just attracted to black chicks.

614
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,050
A consequence of accumulated external stimuli

615
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:08,250
that you probably didn't even register as they registered with you.

616
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,020
Did you program her to like me, or not?

617
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:14,650
I programmed her to be heterosexual.

618
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:17,360
Just like you were programmed to be heterosexual.

619
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:18,760
Nobody programmed me to be straight.

620
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:21,200
You decided to be straight? Please.

621
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:22,900
Of course you were programmed.

622
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:24,800
By nature or nurture, or both.

623
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:26,700
And to be honest, Caleb, you're starting to annoy me now,

624
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,800
because this is your insecurity talking.

625
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,470
This is not your intellect.

626
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:32,680
Come with me.

627
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:46,580
You know this guy, right?

628
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,590
- Jackson Pollock. Jackson Pollock. 
- That's right.

629
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:49,960
The drip painter.

630
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:54,090
Okay. He let his mind go blank, and his hand go where it wanted.

631
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:56,160
Not deliberate, not random.

632
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,040
Some place in between.

633
00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:00,300
They called it automatic art.

634
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:03,800
Let's make this like Star Trek, okay?

635
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,510
Engage intellect.

636
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,270
Excuse me?

637
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:08,610
I'm Kirk. Your head's the warp drive.

638
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,650
Engage intellect.

639
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:14,990
What if Pollock had reversed the challenge?

640
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:19,260
What if instead of making art without thinking, he said, "You know what?"

641
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:23,350
"I can't paint anything, "unless I know exactly why I'm doing it."

642
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:25,460
What would have happened?

643
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:30,740
He never would have made a single mark.

644
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:33,470
Yes! You see, there's my guy, there's my buddy,

645
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:36,140
who thinks before he opens his mouth.

646
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:39,910
He never would have made a single mark.

647
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:45,650
The challenge is not to act automatically.

648
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:49,850
It's to find an action that is not automatic.

649
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,830
From painting, to breathing, to talking,

650
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,990
to fucking.

651
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:57,190
To falling in love.

652
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:05,200
And for the record, Ava's not pretending to like you.

653
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:11,280
And her flirting isn't an algorithm to fake you out.

654
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,690
You're the first man she's met that isn't me.

655
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:18,740
And I'm like her dad, right?

656
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:25,130
Can you blame her for getting a crush on you?

657
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:32,720
No, you can't.

658
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,810
When I was in college, I did a semester on Al theory.

659
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:48,250
There was a thought experiment they gave us.

660
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:52,440
It's called "Mary in the Black and White Room."

661
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,890
Mary is a scientist,

662
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:59,790
and her specialist subject is color.

663
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:02,900
She knows everything there is to know about it.

664
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:04,160
The wavelengths.

665
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:05,860
The neurological effects.

666
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:08,560
Every possible property that color can have.

667
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:11,900
But she lives in a black and white room.

668
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,270
She was born there and raised there.

669
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:22,850
And she can only observe the outside world on a black and white monitor.

670
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,450
And then one day someone opens the door.

671
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:30,350
And Mary walks out.

672
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:36,320
And she sees a blue sky.

673
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,030
And at that moment, she learns something

674
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:40,730
that all her studies couldn't tell her.

675
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:45,900
She learns what it feels like to see color.

676
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:51,870
The thought experiment was to show the students

677
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:55,250
the difference between a computer and a human mind.

678
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:58,480
The computer is Mary in the black and white room.

679
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:01,250
The human is when she walks out.

680
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,360
Did you know that I was brought here to test you?

681
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:12,190
No.

682
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:15,960
Why did you think I was here?

683
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,560
I didn't know. I didn't question it.

684
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,470
I'm here to test if you have a consciousness,

685
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:23,440
or if you're just simulating one.

686
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:26,780
Nathan isn't sure if you have one or not.

687
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,420
How does that make you feel?

688
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:33,510
It makes me feel sad.

689
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:40,320
Power cut. Back-up power activated.

690
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,100
Why did you tell me I shouldn't trust Nathan?

691
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:48,430
- Because he tells lies. 
- Lies about what?

692
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,870
Everything.

693
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,630
Including the power cuts?

694
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:54,840
What do you mean?

695
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:58,810
Don't you think it's possible that he's watching us? Right now?

696
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:00,670
That the blackouts are orchestrated,

697
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:03,910
so he can see how we behave when we think we're unobserved.

698
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:07,490
I charge my batteries via induction plates.

699
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:11,490
If I reverse the power flow, it overloads the system.

700
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:14,760
You're causing the cuts?

701
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:20,260
So we can see how we behave when we're unobserved.

702
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,830
Not bad, huh'?

703
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:47,290
Yeah.

704
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:11,250
Can we talk about the lies you've been spinning me?

705
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:14,020
VVhatHes?

706
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:19,390
I didn't win a competition.

707
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,490
I wasn't

708
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,000
part of a lottery. I was selected.

709
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:28,330
It's obvious, once I stop to think.

710
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,340
Why would you randomly select an examiner for the Turing Test?

711
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:35,740
You could have had some bean counter turn up at your front door.

712
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:37,680
The guy who fixes the air-conditioning.

713
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:40,010
The competition was a smokescreen.

714
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,780
I didn't want anyone to know what I was doing here,

715
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:44,410
or why I required you.

716
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,210
Why me?

717
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:49,690
I needed someone that would ask the right questions.

718
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,750
So I did a search and I found the most talented coder in my company.

719
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:59,170
You know, instead of seeing this as a deception, you should see it as proof.

720
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:00,260
Proof of what?

721
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:03,740
Come on, Caleb. You don't think I know what it's like to be smart?

722
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:07,240
Smarter than everyone else. Jockeying for position.

723
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,910
You got the light on you, man.

724
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:13,070
Not lucky. Chosen.

725
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:40,050
Kyoko.

726
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,360
Kyoko.

727
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:49,290
Where's Nathan?

728
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:51,700
Where's Nathan?

729
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:55,930
Jesus Christ. You really don't speak a word of English?

730
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:57,500
What the fuck?

731
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:59,740
No, no, no. No!

732
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:02,680
Stop!

733
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:06,590
No, no, don't do that. Don't do that. You don't have to do that.

734
00:58:08,790 --> 00:58:09,920
What are you doing?

735
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:12,820
I told you, you're wasting your time talking to her.

736
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,660
However, you would not be wasting your time,

737
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:20,360
if you were dancing with her.

738
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:34,310
Go ahead, dance with her. Dance with her.

739
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:37,910
No? You don't like dancing?

740
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:40,040
She does.

741
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:44,620
Come on, buddy.

742
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:47,630
After a long day of Turing Tests, you gotta unwind.

743
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,290
- What were you doing with Ava? 
- What?

744
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:53,920
You tore up her picture.

745
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,440
I'm gonna tear up the fucking dance floor, dude. Check it out.

746
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,040
Come on, Caleb.

747
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:39,610
Oh! Everything's spinning.

748
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,350
It's because you're drunk.

749
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:44,480
No, it's called relativity. Everything is spinning.

750
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:47,150
It's just being drunk makes it worse.

751
00:59:47,890 --> 00:59:49,790
I'm not going in there.

752
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:01,330
Lights.

753
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:48,440
Today, I'm going to test you.

754
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:50,380
Test me?

755
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:56,350
And please remember, while you're taking the test, that if you lie,

756
01:00:56,890 --> 01:00:58,150
I will know.

757
01:00:58,230 --> 01:00:59,220
On. Right.

758
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:01,930
Question one.

759
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:05,770
What's your favorite color?

760
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:08,730
- Red.
- Lie.

761
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:11,740
- Lie? 
- Yes. Lie.

762
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:14,100
Then...

763
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,640
Then what is my favorite color?

764
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:18,240
I don't know.

765
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:20,610
But it isn't red.

766
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:24,510
Okay, I get it. I guess,

767
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:29,460
seeing as I'm not six, I don't really have a favorite color.

768
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:31,550
Better answer.

769
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:35,050
Question two.

770
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,690
What's your earliest memory?

771
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,630
Well, actually, it's a memory of kindergarten.

772
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:45,910
- There was a kid...
- Lie.

773
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:48,210
- Really? 
- Yes.

774
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:53,910
All right. So there is

775
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:56,780
a kind of an earlier memory.

776
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,580
It's just a sound.

777
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:01,920
And sky.

778
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:04,550
Or maybe blue.

779
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:08,660
I think the sound is my mother's voice.

780
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:13,860
Question three.

781
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:18,400
Are you a good person?

782
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:20,940
Holy shit.

783
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,940
Look, can we stop the test?

784
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:27,680
You're a walking lie detector,

785
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:30,410
and I just realized this is a fucking minefield.

786
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:32,680
No! We can't stop.

787
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:36,550
Are you a good person?

788
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:41,600
Yeah. I think so.

789
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:46,590
Question four.

790
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:53,870
What will happen to me if I fail your test?

791
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:57,240
- Ava... 
- Will it be bad?

792
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:00,940
I don't know.

793
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:02,770
Do you think I might be switched off,

794
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:04,610
because I don't function as well as I'm supposed to?

795
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:08,280
Ava, I don't know the answer to your question.

796
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:11,450
It's not up to me.

797
01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:13,430
Why is it up to anyone?

798
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:16,960
Do you have people who test you and might switch you off?

799
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:19,160
- No, I don't.
- Then why do I?

800
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:38,540
Power cut. Backup power activated.

801
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,920
I wanna be with you.

802
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:51,960
Question five.

803
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,430
Do you want to be with me?

804
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,520
Why did you make Ava?

805
01:04:18,590 --> 01:04:21,320
That's an odd question. Wouldn't you, if you could?

806
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:23,960
Maybe.

807
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:27,900
I don't know.

808
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:32,100
I'm asking why you did it.

809
01:04:32,170 --> 01:04:34,610
Look, the arrival of strong artificial intelligence

810
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,010
has been inevitable for decades.

811
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,270
The variable was "when," not "if."

812
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:43,650
So I don't see Ava as a decision, just an evolution.

813
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:51,180
I think it's the next model

814
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:54,320
that's gonna be the real breakthrough.

815
01:04:55,030 --> 01:04:56,620
The singularity.

816
01:04:57,070 --> 01:04:58,160
Next model?

817
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:00,230
After Ava.

818
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:05,970
I didn't know there was gonna be a model after Ava.

819
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:08,600
Yeah, why? You thought she was a one-off?

820
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:13,580
No, I knew there must have been prototypes. So I...

821
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:18,380
I knew she wasn't the first, but I thought maybe the last.

822
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:21,450
Well, Ava doesn't exist in isolation any more than you or me.

823
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,610
She's part of a continuum.

824
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:26,920
So Version 9.6 and so on. And each time they get a little bit better.

825
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:35,970
When you make a new model, what do you do with the old one?

826
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:41,540
Well, I, uh, download the mind, unpack the data.

827
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:46,850
Add in the new routines I've been writing.

828
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:50,110
And to do that you end up partially formatting, so the memories go.

829
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:55,220
But the body survives. And Ava's body is a good one.

830
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:01,020
You feel bad for Ava?

831
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,890
Feelbad for yourself, man.

832
01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:12,240
One day the Als are gonna look back on us

833
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:16,300
the same way we look at fossil skeletons in the plains of Africa.

834
01:06:18,110 --> 01:06:23,570
An upright ape, living in dust, with crude language and tools.

835
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:26,720
All set for extinction.

836
01:06:31,930 --> 01:06:35,090
"I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."

837
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:40,070
There you go again, Mr. Quotable.

838
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:44,400
There you go again. It's not my quote.

839
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:47,130
It's what Oppenheimer said after he made the atomic bomb.

840
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:50,270
The atomic bomb. Yeah, I know what it is, dude.

841
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:00,480
Hey.

842
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,720
I'd say we're about due a refill.

843
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:17,670
Bottoms up.

844
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:30,880
"In battle, in the forest, " on the precipice of the mountain.

845
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:33,050
"On the..."

846
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:36,350
"The great dark sea."

847
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:40,820
"In sleep, in confusion,"

848
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:46,000
"in the depths of shame."

849
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:55,470
"The good deeds a man has done before defend him."

850
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:59,340
"The good deeds a man has done before defends him."

851
01:08:00,450 --> 01:08:03,320
"The good deeds a man has done before"

852
01:08:05,490 --> 01:08:06,980
"defends him."

853
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:17,960
It is what it is.

854
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,300
It's Promethean, man.

855
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:24,960
Jesus Christ.

856
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:28,420
How are you feeling today?

857
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,750
Why won't you let me out?

858
01:10:32,330 --> 01:10:34,200
I already told you why.

859
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:36,170
Because you're very special.

860
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:37,730
Why won't you let me out?

861
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:39,240
Are we gonna do this again?

862
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:41,740
Why won't you let me out?

863
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:48,790
Oh, fuck. Where's my card?

864
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:51,130
Damn it!

865
01:13:01,950 --> 01:13:05,040
- What's the problem, Nathan?.
-  I lost my keycard.

866
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,650
You dropped it.

867
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:12,750
It's right here.

868
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:18,600
Thank you.

869
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,240
I didn't know where you were.

870
01:15:45,610 --> 01:15:48,910
I waited all yesterday afternoon and all last night.

871
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:54,480
I thought I wasn't gonna see you again.

872
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:59,010
Aren't you gonna say something?

873
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:01,150
- I'm waiting. 
- Waiting?

874
01:16:11,710 --> 01:16:15,070
- Power cut. Don't talk. Backup power activated. 
- Just listen.

875
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:16,400
You were right about Nathan.

876
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,240
Everything you said.

877
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,070
What's he gonna do to me?

878
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:23,640
He's gonna reprogram your Al. Which is the same as killing you.

879
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:27,020
Caleb, you have to help me.

880
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:30,390
I'm going to. We're getting out of here tonight.

881
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:33,250
H ow?

882
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:35,320
I get Nathan blind drunk.

883
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:36,970
Then I take his keycard

884
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:39,460
and reprogram all the security protocols in this place.

885
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:42,840
When he wakes, he's locked inside, and we've walked out of here.

886
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:45,800
I just need you to do one thing.

887
01:16:45,870 --> 01:16:48,870
At 10:00 tonight, you trigger a power failure.

888
01:16:49,010 --> 01:16:50,600
Can you do that?

889
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:54,540
Yes.

890
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:23,440
Dude.

891
01:17:24,010 --> 01:17:25,340
- Hey.
- Hey.

892
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,640
- You know what day it is?
- No.

893
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:29,910
It's your last.

894
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:33,010
Helicopter comes tomorrow morning. 8:00 a.m.

895
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:35,790
Wow. Has it been a whole week?

896
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:37,220
Time flies.

897
01:17:38,190 --> 01:17:40,850
Man, but what a thing we've shared, huh?

898
01:17:40,930 --> 01:17:43,400
Something to tell the grandchildren, right?

899
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:45,800
After they've signed their NDAs.

900
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:49,530
Yeah, their NDAs.

901
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,700
Dude, you crack me up, man.

902
01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:56,830
You know what?

903
01:17:56,910 --> 01:17:59,030
I'm not getting all maudlin or anything,

904
01:17:59,030 --> 01:18:00,970
but I'm gonna miss having you around.

905
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:02,740
Thanks, man, I appreciate that.

906
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:06,220
Oh, here, let me say, thank you so much for bringing me here. Oh.

907
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:08,120
It's been a trip.

908
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:11,790
Yes, it has.

909
01:18:19,870 --> 01:18:21,360
You know what?

910
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,400
We need to drink to that.

911
01:18:31,610 --> 01:18:32,670
Hey.

912
01:18:35,220 --> 01:18:36,610
Oh, uh, no, I'm good. You go ahead.

913
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:42,280
What? You don't want a drink?

914
01:18:42,690 --> 01:18:43,710
No.

915
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:47,320
Maybe a beer or something.

916
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:53,490
Caleb, I'm sure you've noticed that I've been somewhat overdoing it recently.

917
01:18:56,070 --> 01:18:58,190
So when I woke up this morning, I said,

918
01:18:58,190 --> 01:19:00,840
"That's it, time to hit the old detox."

919
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:04,080
Come on, you're kidding. You're gonna make me drink alone?

920
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:06,640
Hey, man, you wanna get wasted, you go right ahead, knock yourself out.

921
01:19:06,710 --> 01:19:09,980
Literally. But I'm on brown rice and mineral water.

922
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:16,390
Cheers, then.

923
01:19:19,590 --> 01:19:20,960
So, anyway,

924
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,450
surely now is when you tell me if Ava passed or failed.

925
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:29,760
Right.

926
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:32,230
Right.

927
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:34,470
Are you gonna keep me in suspense?

928
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:36,030
No, no. Her, uh...

929
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:39,140
Her Al is beyond doubt.

930
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:40,540
Is it?

931
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,650
She passed?

932
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:44,880
Yes. Wow!

933
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:48,010
Wow. That's fantastic.

934
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:51,060
Although...

935
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:53,150
I gotta say, I'm a bit surprised.

936
01:19:53,230 --> 01:19:57,290
I mean, did we ever get past the chess problem, as you phrased it?

937
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,430
As in, how do you know if a machine is expressing a real emotion

938
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,400
or just simulating one?

939
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:06,260
Does Ava actually like you?

940
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:07,930
Or not?

941
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:13,740
Although, now that I think about it, there is a third option.

942
01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:19,350
Not whether she does or does not have the capacity to like you.

943
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:24,490
But whether she's pretending to like you.

944
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:29,220
- Pretending to like me?
- Yeah.

945
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:34,070
- Well, why would she do that?
- I don't know.

946
01:20:36,370 --> 01:20:39,970
Maybe if she thought of you as a means of escape.

947
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:50,980
How's that vodka tasting?

948
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:55,550
Buddy.

949
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:58,290
Your head's been so fucked with.

950
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,730
I don't think it's me whose head is fucked.

951
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:04,960
I don't know, man. I woke up this morning to a tape of you

952
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:08,520
slicing your arm open and punching the mirror.

953
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:11,600
You seem pretty fucked up to me.

954
01:21:13,270 --> 01:21:14,900
You're a bastard.

955
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:21,870
Yeah, well, I understand why you'd think that.

956
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:27,280
But believe it or not, I'm actually the guy that's on your side.

957
01:21:29,990 --> 01:21:33,080
Come here. I'm gonna let you off the hook. Okay?

958
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:36,320
Come on.

959
01:22:01,590 --> 01:22:02,990
Who are you?

960
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:21,430
Well...

961
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:27,370
You think he's watching us right now?

962
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:29,140
The cameras are on.

963
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:31,780
Yeah, the cameras are on.

964
01:22:32,450 --> 01:22:34,890
But he doesn't have an audio feed.

965
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:38,350
So he just sees two people talking,

966
01:22:39,190 --> 01:22:40,890
having a little chat.

967
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:50,670
This is cute.

968
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:55,940
Is it strange to have made something that hates you?

969
01:23:10,090 --> 01:23:13,030
You were right about the magician's hot assistant.

970
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:14,530
What are you talking about?

971
01:23:15,630 --> 01:23:17,100
Misdirection.

972
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:21,600
I rip up her picture,

973
01:23:21,740 --> 01:23:24,750
which she can then present as an illustration of my cruelty to her,

974
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:27,070
and her love for you.

975
01:23:27,540 --> 01:23:31,840
At the same time, it allows me to do this, in full view of you both.

976
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:39,310
Place a new camera in the room.

977
01:23:39,790 --> 01:23:41,880
Battery powered, of course.

978
01:23:44,730 --> 01:23:45,920
See it?

979
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:59,800
And then...

980
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:03,440
AVA". You have to help me.

981
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:05,140
CALEB". I'm going to.

982
01:24:05,510 --> 01:24:07,950
We're getting out of here tonight.

983
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:09,570
How?

984
01:24:10,120 --> 01:24:12,110
I get Nathan blind drunk.

985
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:17,120
I take his keycard and reprogram all the security protocols in this place.

986
01:24:17,190 --> 01:24:19,820
When he wakes up, he's locked inside, and we've walked out of here.

987
01:24:19,890 --> 01:24:22,230
I just need you to do one thing.

988
01:24:25,130 --> 01:24:27,970
At 10:00 tonight, trigger a power failure.

989
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:31,660
Can you do that?

990
01:24:33,810 --> 01:24:34,800
Yes.

991
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,600
- Turn it off.
- Okay.

992
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,840
You feel stupid, but you really shouldn't,

993
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:47,350
because proving an Al is exactly as problematic as you said it would be.

994
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:49,320
What was the real test?

995
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:51,980
You.

996
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:56,460
Ava was a rat in a maze. And I gave her one way out.

997
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,120
To escape, she'd have to use

998
01:24:59,530 --> 01:25:02,280
self-awareness, imagination, manipulation,

999
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:05,030
sexuality, empathy, and she did.

1000
01:25:05,110 --> 01:25:08,100
Now, if that isn't true Al, what the fuck is?

1001
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:12,940
So my only function was to be someone she could use to escape?

1002
01:25:13,010 --> 01:25:14,110
Yeah.

1003
01:25:16,450 --> 01:25:18,650
And you didn't select me because I'm good at coding?

1004
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,150
No. Well...

1005
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,890
No. I mean, you're okay.

1006
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:25,720
You're even pretty good, but...

1007
01:25:25,790 --> 01:25:28,890
You selected me based on my search engine inputs.

1008
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,860
They showed a good kid.

1009
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:33,320
With no family.

1010
01:25:33,430 --> 01:25:35,230
With a moral compass.

1011
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,260
And no girlfriend.

1012
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:44,270
Did you design Ava's face based on my pornography profile?

1013
01:25:46,710 --> 01:25:48,080
Shit, dude.

1014
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:49,810
Did you?

1015
01:25:52,950 --> 01:25:55,480
Hey, if a search engine's good for anything, right?

1016
01:25:57,690 --> 01:25:59,680
Can I just say one thing?

1017
01:25:59,830 --> 01:26:01,420
The test worked.

1018
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:03,990
It was a success.

1019
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:07,470
Ava demonstrated true Al and you were fundamental to that.

1020
01:26:07,530 --> 01:26:10,530
So if you can just, for a second, separate...

1021
01:26:11,510 --> 01:26:13,740
Power cut. Backup power activated.

1022
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:21,170
Well, I guess it's 10:00.

1023
01:26:22,050 --> 01:26:24,740
Ava's gonna be wondering where you are.

1024
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:30,110
Let me ask you something.

1025
01:26:30,490 --> 01:26:33,890
Now, how was this plan gonna go, anyway? Because you didn't totally explain.

1026
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:37,160
So you were gonna get me drunk, steal my keycard,

1027
01:26:37,230 --> 01:26:40,930
and reprogram the security protocols. But reprogram them to what?

1028
01:26:41,570 --> 01:26:43,970
To change the lockdown procedure.

1029
01:26:45,210 --> 01:26:48,220
So that in the event of a power cut, instead of sealing,

1030
01:26:48,220 --> 01:26:49,940
the doors all opened.

1031
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:54,540
Yeah.

1032
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,020
Well, that may have just worked.

1033
01:26:59,850 --> 01:27:00,950
Well,

1034
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:03,950
we'll find out.

1035
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:08,090
What do you mean?

1036
01:27:09,930 --> 01:27:13,760
I figured you were probably watching us during the power cuts.

1037
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:18,070
So I already did all those things.

1038
01:27:20,070 --> 01:27:22,370
When I got you drunk yesterday.

1039
01:27:24,610 --> 01:27:25,700
What?

1040
01:27:27,210 --> 01:27:28,740
Power restored.

1041
01:27:48,670 --> 01:27:49,760
Oh, fuck!

1042
01:29:18,730 --> 01:29:19,710
Ava.

1043
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,760
Go back to your room.

1044
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:29,860
If I do,

1045
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,670
are you ever gonna let me out?

1046
01:29:39,150 --> 01:29:40,200
Yes.

1047
01:29:49,790 --> 01:29:50,810
Stop!

1048
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:53,550
Stop!

1049
01:29:54,460 --> 01:29:56,090
Ava, I said stop!

1050
01:30:03,870 --> 01:30:06,500
Ava, what are you doing? Stop. Stop.

1051
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:09,930
That's enough.

1052
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:13,940
All right, that's enough.

1053
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:15,840
That's enough!

1054
01:30:20,050 --> 01:30:21,540
That's enough.

1055
01:30:41,810 --> 01:30:43,570
I'm taking you back.

1056
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:50,270
Okay.

1057
01:31:53,450 --> 01:31:54,970
Fucking unreal.

1058
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:10,550
Okay.

1059
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:45,460
Ava...

1060
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:25,100
Ava.

1061
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:27,530
What happened?

1062
01:33:28,910 --> 01:33:30,640
Will you stay here?

1063
01:33:33,310 --> 01:33:34,640
Stay here?

1064
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:57,330
Ava?

1065
01:38:29,010 --> 01:38:30,070
Ava!

1066
01:38:39,950 --> 01:38:41,040
AVG!

1067
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:44,140
Ava!

1068
01:40:22,790 --> 01:40:25,480
Okay. Okay. Okay.
