1
00:02:42,447 --> 00:02:44,915
Fucking idiot.
First finish your job...

2
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:49,001
...finish your job, then go fuck,
do whatever you want.

3
00:02:57,607 --> 00:02:58,926
Go fuck yourself idiot.

4
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:02,006
What am I going to teIl him?
How wilI l explain this?

5
00:03:03,927 --> 00:03:05,838
What am l going to say to him?

6
00:03:40,527 --> 00:03:43,678
My life has always been like this.

7
00:03:45,607 --> 00:03:48,838
I've always gone the wrong way.

8
00:03:49,767 --> 00:03:51,678
Just like a bad Turkish fiIm.

9
00:03:55,087 --> 00:03:56,440
But l'm waiting.

10
00:03:57,527 --> 00:04:00,246
The one up there wilI open
the road for me some day.

11
00:04:00,527 --> 00:04:02,677
It can't continue like this.

12
00:04:03,247 --> 00:04:05,078
Why don't we start from the beginning?

13
00:04:05,847 --> 00:04:07,678
Where were you born?

14
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,078
l was born in Sivas.

15
00:04:13,447 --> 00:04:14,436
ln the vilIage of lnceyoI.

16
00:04:17,847 --> 00:04:21,601
lf you don't count the ones that died before me,
I was the 9th kid.

17
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:23,997
The youngest. Bottom of the pot.

18
00:04:26,527 --> 00:04:30,236
Things were aIways busy at home.
My dad would beat us Iike it was his job.

19
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:34,520
He didn't make money from the fields that year?.
Come here Metin.

20
00:04:35,847 --> 00:04:37,439
His soccerteam did badly?

21
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:42,077
My mom had another girl?
He would beat the shit out of us.

22
00:04:42,847 --> 00:04:45,600
Of course we hated him.
Everyday a beating...

23
00:04:48,847 --> 00:04:50,246
One day I had enough.

24
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,441
l stuck a knife in his back.

25
00:04:56,767 --> 00:04:58,086
Son, what did you do?

26
00:04:58,367 --> 00:05:00,085
You know what they say...

27
00:05:00,247 --> 00:05:04,240
Beat a dog that much,
he'lI turn back and bite his owner.

28
00:05:05,927 --> 00:05:09,761
What did you do?
My god what did you do?

29
00:05:11,447 --> 00:05:14,086
l was 15. How should l have known?

30
00:05:17,007 --> 00:05:17,837
Whatever...

31
00:05:20,247 --> 00:05:22,761
ObviousIy I couIdn't stay in the
viIlage after this incident.

32
00:05:23,607 --> 00:05:25,279
I got my mother's bIessing...

33
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:27,166
Jumped on the bus...

34
00:05:27,767 --> 00:05:30,600
To the one safe place l could go.

35
00:05:44,247 --> 00:05:46,283
IstanbuI's a strange Iand.

36
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:50,678
It seems it's the pIace
where everyone ends up.

37
00:05:51,447 --> 00:05:54,439
It's purgatory.
It's helI. It's heaven.

38
00:05:54,847 --> 00:05:57,077
lt's one of a kind.

39
00:05:57,847 --> 00:05:59,599
It's been my fate.

40
00:06:00,007 --> 00:06:04,762
lf I hadn't come here for a reason like this,
it may have been different.

41
00:06:06,607 --> 00:06:08,006
It's a tough city.

42
00:06:08,247 --> 00:06:12,240
No money, no power.
You can't do it. They'lI finish you.

43
00:06:12,847 --> 00:06:16,157
I wasn't smart back then.
My head was fuIl of snot.

44
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:21,523
There was no one waiting
back home for me.

45
00:06:21,607 --> 00:06:25,236
I did anything l had to.
a new job everyday.

46
00:06:26,607 --> 00:06:31,158
l had nothing to lose.
Worse case l'd go in for 3-5 years.

47
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,156
That's exactIy what happened.

48
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:38,279
In-out. In-out.

49
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:46,996
Veysel, send me a pack of cigarettes.

50
00:06:49,687 --> 00:06:52,440
15 years in totaI.

51
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:57,080
I was getting older.
Yesterday's kids were now bosses.

52
00:06:57,447 --> 00:07:01,998
l had to stop. I got a reaI job.

53
00:07:06,247 --> 00:07:08,522
I'm in a hurry
l can't pick you up. I said no.

54
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:12,158
I've been working for
a guy named ahmet Abi.

55
00:07:14,527 --> 00:07:17,087
A deIivery service of sorts.
To homes, businesses...

56
00:07:18,247 --> 00:07:20,238
Where have you been?
The girls are waiting.

57
00:07:20,447 --> 00:07:22,517
I'm not delivering a pizza.
Don't caIl so Iate next time.

58
00:07:22,687 --> 00:07:24,917
lf I was smarter l could've
had some money saved up.

59
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:27,237
But l've been spending everything l get.

60
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,836
l'Il save money on the bigger jobs.

61
00:07:30,287 --> 00:07:34,599
ahmet Abi suggested l wouId
get big jobs soon. We'lI see.

62
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:51,917
From the looks of it, today shouId
have been a good day.

63
00:07:52,687 --> 00:07:56,077
Ahmet abi had calIed me in.
That's a big deal.

64
00:07:56,767 --> 00:08:00,282
l've been with him for a while now.
and I've never messed up.

65
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,758
He must have pIans for me.

66
00:08:03,847 --> 00:08:05,599
lt's that sort of a day.

67
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,437
What's this?

68
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:47,755
Shit.

69
00:08:48,247 --> 00:08:49,077
What's going on?

70
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:50,686
Nothing. Go back to sleep.

71
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:52,163
What's this?

72
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:53,083
What?

73
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,436
What is this?

74
00:08:54,607 --> 00:08:55,835
Go back to sIeep.

75
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:57,361
Why is it wet?

76
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,516
Why is it wet?

77
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:02,916
Did you pee?

78
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:05,282
What are taIking about? You crazy?

79
00:09:05,447 --> 00:09:06,846
You're disgusting.

00:09:06,927 --> 00:09:08,155
ldiot.

81
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:10,358
Don't touch me with those hands.
There's pee alI overthem.

82
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:12,724
lt's humid in--
Don't touch me.

83
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:14,678
Grow up first. asshoIe.

84
00:09:15,527 --> 00:09:17,916
Why do aIl the losers find me?

85
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:19,998
Where are you going?

86
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:36,000
TV a 74 year oId man has
died as a resuIt of bee stings...

87
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:39,079
... in the town of GoIcuk in KocaeIi.

88
00:09:41,087 --> 00:09:43,681
This is the second such
incident in the past week.

89
00:09:43,927 --> 00:09:48,523
Experts fearthe bees are
migratory kilIer bees from africa.

90
00:09:50,247 --> 00:09:52,158
Those stung by bees are urged...

91
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:55,279
When's Ahmet abi going to caIl me in?
My ass is flattened from sitting here.

92
00:09:55,927 --> 00:09:56,916
You have to wait.

93
00:09:57,087 --> 00:09:58,236
I'm waiting.

94
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,087
The number of people
reporting to hospitals rose to 9.

95
00:10:01,247 --> 00:10:04,444
To get the latest,
we are going Iive to...

96
00:10:06,527 --> 00:10:08,995
Do you have an aspirin?
My head's kilIing me from last night.

97
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:10,007
No.

98
00:10:10,007 --> 00:10:14,239
Open a window orsomething.
It's disgusting in here.

99
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,237
lt feeIs like earthquake weather.

100
00:10:17,447 --> 00:10:19,085
Stop taIking Iike an idiot.

101
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:26,916
So what exactIy do you do here?
What's your deal?

102
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:28,516
None of your business.

103
00:10:28,687 --> 00:10:29,597
God...

104
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:33,677
Come on Metin.

105
00:10:33,847 --> 00:10:35,075

We can't find you when we need you.

108
00:10:48,007 --> 00:10:50,237
I'm at your command, brother.
Ready for anything.

109
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:52,359
What did you do with your debt?

110
00:10:52,447 --> 00:10:53,436

111
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,677
Thanks to you, brother

112
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:57,441

HiImi is expecting this. At 3 o'cIock.

Brother, don't take this

00:11:32,687 --> 00:11:35,155
...isn't this a job for a driver?.

118
00:11:45,847 --> 00:11:47,075
Go Metin.

119
00:11:56,847 --> 00:11:59,441
There won't be any problems, right?

120
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:07,236
Yildiz, it's me.

Get rid of this.

129
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:15,680
Slow down.

130
00:13:28,847 --> 00:13:30,360
Relax a little.

131
00:13:33,247 --> 00:13:34,919
What happened?

132
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:41,362
You think you're the shit sometimes.

133
00:13:43,287 --> 00:13:45,278
But then others treat you Iike shit.

134
00:13:46,607 --> 00:13:48,086
lt's not fair.

135
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:50,927
That's what you're upset about?
Come on get up.

136
00:15:33,447 --> 00:15:34,926
Shit.

00:15:48,767 --> 00:15:50,246
Yildiz, where did you put my bag?

139
00:15:50,447 --> 00:15:52,597
I don't know.
Somewhere in there.

140
00:15:52,847 --> 00:15:54,519
What do you mean you don't know.
Where is it?

141
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,917
You must have put it overthere.

142
00:15:57,167 --> 00:15:59,078
Don't make me crazy.

143
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:00,516
Look around.

144
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,166
Who knows where you tossed it.

145
00:16:02,367 --> 00:16:04,085
Don't make me crazy.
Look for it.

146
00:16:05,087 --> 00:16:06,076
WiIl you calm down?

147
00:16:06,247 --> 00:16:07,839
Calm down? My bag is gone.

148
00:16:08,087 --> 00:16:09,600
Where did it go in this little shithoIe?

149
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:10,996
I don't know.

150
00:16:11,167 --> 00:16:13,078
I don't know?
That's the only thing you can say?

151
00:16:13,287 --> 00:16:15,755
You have to know.
Find my bag.

152
00:16:16,087 --> 00:16:17,520
Stop yeIling at me.

153
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:18,995
Where did you put it?

154
00:16:19,247 --> 00:16:21,761
Look under the table?
ln case it got underthere by itseIf? Sure.

155
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:32,282
Shit.

156
00:16:32,607 --> 00:16:35,167
Was the window open the whole time?

157
00:16:53,007 --> 00:16:55,077
You motherfucker.

158
00:16:55,367 --> 00:16:58,279
You couldn't even do this stupid job.
What good are you?

159
00:16:59,087 --> 00:17:00,759
How am I going to explain this?

160
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:03,078
Shit on my head.

161
00:17:03,927 --> 00:17:05,997
lt's an easy job.
Just deliverthe bag.

162
00:17:07,607 --> 00:17:10,519
You think you're a king?
You didn't like the job?

163
00:17:10,767 --> 00:17:13,759
You feel bad about it?
Fuck you.

164
00:17:14,527 --> 00:17:16,165
KilI me right now.

165
00:17:18,007 --> 00:17:22,239
l want just one thing to go
right in my life. One thing.

166
00:17:23,087 --> 00:17:26,238
God, take my Iife right now.

167
00:17:27,607 --> 00:17:28,926
Don't ring...don't ring.

168
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:17,158
207, 208, 209, 210...

169
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:21,679
211, 212, 213, 214...

170
00:18:21,847 --> 00:18:27,160
215, 216, 217, 218...

171
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:30,439
219, 220.

172
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:34,680
It's 220 steps from
the break room to room 405.

173
00:18:35,847 --> 00:18:39,078
So, 2 pIus 2 plus 0.

174
00:18:39,687 --> 00:18:43,236
4-0, or 40.

175
00:18:44,087 --> 00:18:45,998
40 symbolizes fate.

176
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:49,916
The Persians, ancient Egyptians,
Greek mythoIogy...

177
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,237
They aIl give 40 a special pIace.

178
00:18:52,767 --> 00:18:53,995
I don't understand.

179
00:18:54,687 --> 00:18:56,598
Do you know what numerology is?

180
00:18:57,007 --> 00:18:58,360
Something like fortune teIling?

181
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:00,361
Fortune telIing?

182
00:19:01,527 --> 00:19:04,599
Fortune telIing is a simpIe
game for stupid people.

183
00:19:05,527 --> 00:19:07,245
NumeroIogy is scientific.

184
00:19:08,087 --> 00:19:09,918
It's based on math and Iogic.

185
00:19:10,247 --> 00:19:12,920
There's a numerological
system beneath everything.

186
00:19:13,247 --> 00:19:14,157
Nothing happens by luck.

187
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:19,076
Numerology heIps soIve
this mysterious system.

188
00:19:20,847 --> 00:19:24,442
Accepting that we are a part
of something bigger...

189
00:19:24,687 --> 00:19:28,077
Gives meaning to our otherwise
meaningIess lives.

190
00:19:30,247 --> 00:19:33,762
The universe gives us signs.
We just need to see them.

191
00:19:44,687 --> 00:19:46,837
Ourfates are hidden in our numbers.

192
00:19:47,447 --> 00:19:51,360
Our eyes and feelings can deceive us.
But numbers never Iie.

193
00:19:56,927 --> 00:20:00,442
Your numbers are 2, 4 and 11.

194
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:04,077
And 40. But that
number is something special.

195
00:20:05,527 --> 00:20:08,360
Whenever you come across this number,
you have to act fast.

196
00:20:08,527 --> 00:20:11,087
40. Don't forget it.

197
00:20:14,367 --> 00:20:17,518
I constantly searched forthe meaning
of life before I discovered numeroIogy.

198
00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:20,839
l was a Buddhist for 9 months.

199
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:23,918
I tried Christianity for 17 months.

200
00:20:24,927 --> 00:20:27,441
I even covered up for 3 months.

201
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:30,440
But the emptiness neverwent away.

202
00:20:33,247 --> 00:20:35,681
My first year as a nurse,
l feIl in Iove with a doctor.

203
00:20:36,607 --> 00:20:39,679
I know it's a cliche.
But our numbers were a good match.

204
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:43,758
His fate numberwas 2. Mine was 4.

205
00:20:44,287 --> 00:20:46,755
There are no objections to your marriage.

206
00:20:46,927 --> 00:20:48,997
You, daughter of Sait, Sevda Topal...

207
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:52,239
Do you take the son of Mehmet,
Ali Eren as your spouse?

208
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,598
Numbers had given
me aIl the right signs.

209
00:20:59,607 --> 00:21:00,676
l do.

210
00:21:10,287 --> 00:21:11,686
What happened afterthat?

211
00:21:25,607 --> 00:21:26,756
What are you doing Sevda?

212
00:21:26,847 --> 00:21:27,757
Who's that woman?

213
00:21:27,927 --> 00:21:30,157
Do l know the whore you asshoIe?

214
00:21:30,287 --> 00:21:31,925
Calm down, you're pregnant.

215
00:21:32,087 --> 00:21:34,999
Do l know the whore?

216
00:21:35,247 --> 00:21:36,760
Don't expIain it.

217
00:21:36,847 --> 00:21:38,917
CaIm down. The whoIe
building wiIl be at our door.

218
00:21:39,087 --> 00:21:40,361
l don't care.

219
00:21:40,847 --> 00:21:44,362
What kind of man are you?

220
00:21:44,687 --> 00:21:46,166
CaIm down, please.

221
00:21:46,527 --> 00:21:48,085
I don't care about the baby.

222
00:21:49,927 --> 00:21:51,758
Things never got on the right track.

223
00:21:54,367 --> 00:21:56,437
Then, that idiot Iost his job.

224
00:21:57,687 --> 00:21:59,518
He had slept with
everyone at the hospital.

225
00:22:00,447 --> 00:22:03,166
He spent the little money
we had saved up.

226
00:22:04,287 --> 00:22:06,676
Everything was Ieft on my shoulders.

227
00:22:07,287 --> 00:22:08,436
Eat your dinner.

228
00:22:10,087 --> 00:22:12,999
I must be going through a test.

229
00:22:14,447 --> 00:22:16,915
l'm even doubting numbers now.

230
00:22:23,247 --> 00:22:25,442
Numbers don't lie.

231
00:22:25,847 --> 00:22:27,166
l want to believe that.

232
00:22:29,527 --> 00:22:31,597
But l need a sign.

233
00:23:05,007 --> 00:23:06,599
The poor guy.

234
00:23:07,087 --> 00:23:08,839
a taxi hit him and Ieft him.

235
00:23:09,527 --> 00:23:11,438
There's such heartIess people...

236
00:24:18,007 --> 00:24:18,996
Nurse...

237
00:24:20,527 --> 00:24:23,087
The patient in 316 needs a bandage.

238
00:24:23,927 --> 00:24:25,155
OK. l'Il be right there.

239
00:24:38,847 --> 00:24:39,916
What's wrong Sevda?

240
00:24:40,167 --> 00:24:41,156
I'lI be right back.

241
00:25:08,527 --> 00:25:10,677
l'm not very good at these sort of things.

242
00:25:10,847 --> 00:25:12,360
l don't Iike to taIk much.

243
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:15,164
AlI right, let's start with your name.

244
00:25:17,687 --> 00:25:19,917
My name is GodwiIl OgboIlu.

245
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:25,517
I was born in Wawa, in Nigeria.

246
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:32,846
I was an only child.

247
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:36,000
My parents had tried
to have a kid for years.

248
00:25:37,087 --> 00:25:39,157
AlI the viIlagers blamed my mother.

249
00:25:39,687 --> 00:25:41,598
She never toId them the truth.

250
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,761
My birth came as
a surprise to the viIlage.

251
00:25:46,527 --> 00:25:50,156
It was decIared
a miracle by the priests...

252
00:25:50,287 --> 00:25:52,926
an act of god.

253
00:25:53,687 --> 00:25:57,600
That's why my mother calIed me GodwiIl.

254
00:25:57,927 --> 00:26:00,839
..subject verb and how they affect each other.
"l" becomes the subject.

255
00:26:00,927 --> 00:26:05,842
"Am" describes what is happening now.
Or "was" -what happened yesterday.

256
00:26:05,927 --> 00:26:07,599
Or "wiIl" - what wiIl happen tomorrow.

257
00:26:07,687 --> 00:26:11,157
The happiest moment in
my life was when I met Gina.

258
00:26:12,927 --> 00:26:16,283
Gina was the daughter of a famous politician
who had just moved to our vilIage.

259
00:26:17,927 --> 00:26:20,077
AlI the boys in school in Iove with her.

260
00:26:20,367 --> 00:26:23,359
Let me see if you understand so far.
GodwiIl! GodwilI!!

261
00:26:32,927 --> 00:26:34,838
GodwilI! Why aren't
you listening to me?

262
00:26:35,087 --> 00:26:38,079
You think l'm here as just a preacher,
making noise here?

263
00:26:38,367 --> 00:26:41,359
There are mothers out there crossing
rivers to bring their children in my cIass...

264
00:26:41,607 --> 00:26:44,519
And you are here just sitting.
What is wrong with you?

265
00:26:44,847 --> 00:26:46,599
Come here. Come here.

266
00:26:47,007 --> 00:26:48,247
Everybody look at me and Iearn.

267
00:26:48,247 --> 00:26:50,841
This is what we do to chiIdren
who don't listen as I'm teaching.

268
00:26:51,087 --> 00:26:52,076
Precious education.

269
00:26:57,847 --> 00:27:00,839
My motherwas the onIy person
who realIy cared for me...

270
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:03,077
Until Gina.

271
00:27:05,767 --> 00:27:06,836
Are you okay?

272
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,523
Gina had opinions about things
l hadn't even heard of.

273
00:27:10,687 --> 00:27:12,287
I wiIl show the world.

274
00:27:12,287 --> 00:27:14,437
She wanted to be an important author...

275
00:27:15,847 --> 00:27:18,441
Feminist author orsomething
Iike that l can't exactly remember

276
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:19,887
women have a place too.

277
00:27:19,887 --> 00:27:22,276
Why should we be treated
Iike second class peopIe?

278
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:24,757
She had already started
writing herfirst book.

279
00:27:25,087 --> 00:27:27,920
She talked Iike an adult
which impressed me.

280
00:27:28,087 --> 00:27:30,282
So what do you want
to be when you grow up?

281
00:27:30,687 --> 00:27:35,078
Maybe l'Il work at the factory.
My father Iikes it there.

282
00:27:35,367 --> 00:27:41,158
My goaI is to travel around the worId.
I'm going to Ieave this pIace as soon as l can.

283
00:27:41,447 --> 00:27:44,166
You need bigger
ambitions too, GodwilI.

284
00:27:48,927 --> 00:27:52,920
Like aIl the rich kids in town,
Gina transferred to a private schooI.

285
00:27:53,247 --> 00:27:56,080
And l started working
at the factory outside of town.

286
00:27:56,367 --> 00:28:00,997
l passed the time thinking of her.
Every night I dream of marrying her.

287
00:28:04,087 --> 00:28:07,363
after high school Gina left for
Paris to go to university.

288
00:28:10,847 --> 00:28:13,441
l never got to telI her
what she meant to me.

289
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:34,679
So how did you end up in IstanbuI?

290
00:28:34,927 --> 00:28:39,842
I wanted to beat my fears
and telI Gina l Iove her.

291
00:28:46,687 --> 00:28:48,996
l stayed working at the
factory for many years...

292
00:28:49,247 --> 00:28:52,239
And Iike aIl the others
l got on a boat to Europe.

293
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:16,156
Hamza Abi...

294
00:30:23,247 --> 00:30:26,523
This wasn't the Paris
I had seen in movies.

295
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:30,835
l Iearned Iater that
l was in lstanbul.

296
00:30:34,007 --> 00:30:36,760
For 4 years, it's been home.

297
00:30:39,847 --> 00:30:42,247
Like aIl the other
unwanteds in lstanbul,

298
00:30:42,247 --> 00:30:44,602
l Iive in a neighborhood
calIed Tarlabas.

299
00:30:50,367 --> 00:30:51,686
It's in the center of town...

300
00:30:51,847 --> 00:30:54,077
But most locals don't venture here.

301
00:30:54,287 --> 00:30:59,520
Pickpockets...Kurdish gangs...
africans...drug addicts...

302
00:30:59,927 --> 00:31:02,077
...transvestites...

303
00:31:02,687 --> 00:31:04,837
...they alI end up here.

304
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,687
There are Iots of guys
in Tarlabas who heIp

305
00:31:07,687 --> 00:31:10,155
bring people Iike me to
Europe for 10,000 Euro.

306
00:31:11,927 --> 00:31:15,602
l work alI day and night.
I've already saved most of it.

307
00:31:15,847 --> 00:31:17,997
It's just a matter of time now.

308
00:31:19,287 --> 00:31:22,438
Everybody here thinks l'm crazy.

309
00:31:23,087 --> 00:31:25,237
But I believe in miracles.

310
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:28,157
I know I wiIl see Gina again.

311
00:31:30,287 --> 00:31:32,517
God wiIl not leave me haIf way.

312
00:32:56,087 --> 00:32:58,362
Where have you been?
I'm sick of you.

313
00:32:58,847 --> 00:33:00,439
You're Iate again.

314
00:33:00,767 --> 00:33:03,600
How do they come on time?
Lazy asshole.

315
00:33:04,367 --> 00:33:07,006
Do it again and see what happens. ldiot.

316
00:33:07,847 --> 00:33:08,677
Sorry, boss.

317
00:33:08,927 --> 00:33:10,679
Sorry? Get to work.

318
00:33:14,927 --> 00:33:16,519
Morning.

319
00:33:19,007 --> 00:33:20,440
l could not wake up.

320
00:33:20,687 --> 00:33:23,440
You have to give up that job.
lt's no good for you.

321
00:34:58,247 --> 00:35:00,761
PIease... I'm sorry to bother you.

322
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:03,677
lt's no bother.

323
00:35:04,007 --> 00:35:07,158
They toId me l could
find other Africans here.

324
00:35:08,847 --> 00:35:10,997
Are you new here?

325
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,677
I'm looking for a pIace to stay.

326
00:35:34,607 --> 00:35:36,757
Just give me a moment.

327
00:36:02,247 --> 00:36:04,442
You can sIeep in my room here.

328
00:36:04,687 --> 00:36:07,247
I'lI stay with the guys.

329
00:38:12,447 --> 00:38:14,677
Have you seen the woman
that was with me yesterday?

330
00:38:15,247 --> 00:38:16,236
Have you seen her??

331
00:41:44,367 --> 00:41:47,165
What's going on?
Was there an earthquake?

332
00:42:49,927 --> 00:42:51,360
Is Mahmut here?

333
00:42:56,927 --> 00:42:59,839
OK, don't worry, we'Il take care of that.

334
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:03,006
l'Il have it done by Tuesday.

335
00:43:03,087 --> 00:43:04,918
Ok, kisses to you.

336
00:43:06,247 --> 00:43:07,521
Did you get the money?

337
00:43:07,767 --> 00:43:09,166
l found it.

338
00:43:09,367 --> 00:43:10,925
Good for you.

339
00:43:13,607 --> 00:43:15,245
Ten thousand Euros.

00:43:23,687 --> 00:43:29,080

341
00:43:30,167 --> 00:43:33,443
We'lI take you to Cesme,

From there,

You'lI be drinking coffee
in Paris by Wednesday.

There'lI be a lot of paperwork.
I don't want to hoId him long.

357
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:38,676
Let him feel a little better,

00:47:43,847 --> 00:47:45,246
Where's my bag?

359

00:50:22,527 --> 00:50:23,676
I don't mean anything, brother.

379
00:50:33,287 --> 00:50:34,276
Brother...

That's impossible, brother.
How can l find it in 24 hours?

398
00:51:30,767 --> 00:51:32,519

399
00:51:35,247 --> 00:51:38,762

But it's 50,000 Euros.

Life is hard for us, Metin.

403

You got 23 stitches.

00:53:14,247 --> 00:53:16,078
23 is the most cursed of aIl numbers.

420

Asshole.

Come on, women Iove that.
You know, scarred, bruised men.

458
00:59:33,087 --> 00:59:34,918
Suleyman, for God's sake...

460
00:59:41,607 --> 00:59:42,596
Brother...

461
00:59:43,087 --> 00:59:44,998
I wouldn't do this if l wasn't in troubIe...

462
00:59:47,927 --> 00:59:51,283
Do you have any money?

463

How Much?

464
00:59:55,087 --> 00:59:55,917

465
00:59:56,247 --> 00:59:57,287
Lira?

466
00:59:57,287 --> 00:59:58,766
No, not Iira.

467
00:59:59,087 --> 01:00:00,076
That wouId be easy.

468
01:00:00,687 --> 01:00:02,166
Euro.

469
01:00:04,687 --> 01:00:06,279
Euro? 50,000 Euros?

470
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:10,155
You're never going to change, Metin.

471
01:00:11,447 --> 01:00:13,677
You came into the worId crooked,
you're going to leave it crooked.

472
01:00:14,007 --> 01:00:16,362
How am I going to find
this money in one day?

473
01:00:17,087 --> 01:00:19,840
If l could even find a part of it,
I couId take it to him...

474
01:00:19,927 --> 01:00:22,077
And say, take this for now.

I may...

476
01:00:25,927 --> 01:00:28,282
Be able to set you up with a job.

477
01:00:30,287 --> 01:00:34,075
18, 20, 22, 24..

478
01:00:34,247 --> 01:00:37,239
26, 28, 30...

479
01:00:37,927 --> 01:00:40,361
32, 34, 36...

480
01:00:40,767 --> 01:00:42,837
38, 40.

481
01:00:52,687 --> 01:00:54,678
Pinar. Get up.

482
01:00:55,007 --> 01:00:56,076
Come on.

483
01:00:57,247 --> 01:00:59,078
I bought you that cake you Iike.

484
01:01:01,167 --> 01:01:01,997
Come on, Pinar.

485
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:19,281
Let us go, GodwilI.

486
01:01:20,607 --> 01:01:22,086
But it's not fair.

487
01:01:22,527 --> 01:01:24,358
It doesn't matter.

488
01:01:27,687 --> 01:01:30,155
She Iooked me in the eye and lied.

489
01:01:31,447 --> 01:01:32,926
lf I were you...

490
01:01:33,087 --> 01:01:35,442
I would forget about it and Ieave this city.

491
01:01:43,847 --> 01:01:45,360
You know Murat?

492
01:01:45,527 --> 01:01:46,596
Bastard, Murat.

493
01:01:46,847 --> 01:01:48,360
He toId me about this pIace

494
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:53,001
Why is there so much money in a car park?

495
01:01:53,607 --> 01:01:54,676
Are you sure there's no mistake?

496
01:01:54,847 --> 01:01:55,677
No, Brother.

497
01:01:56,367 --> 01:01:57,846
The owner is mafia.

498
01:01:59,527 --> 01:02:01,358
They have a crappy
office in the back.

499
01:02:01,767 --> 01:02:03,439
That's where they
run everything from.

500
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:08,075
I know them. They won't keep Iess then
10-15 thousand Euros in the safe.

501
01:02:08,167 --> 01:02:09,998
No kidding?

502
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:12,078
See the guard...

503
01:02:13,087 --> 01:02:14,679
He's the boss's nephew.

504
01:02:15,087 --> 01:02:17,840
He knows the combination for the safe.
He's your guy.

505
01:02:18,007 --> 01:02:20,077
What if he has a gun?

506
01:02:22,007 --> 01:02:23,440
I don't think so.

507
01:02:26,167 --> 01:02:27,236
Are you scared?

508
01:02:27,527 --> 01:02:29,245
No, it's just...

509
01:02:29,527 --> 01:02:31,597
Look at my face.
lf he does something...

510
01:02:32,007 --> 01:02:34,919
There's nothing to it, brother.
Go in and get the money.

511
01:02:35,767 --> 01:02:37,280
Go in and get the money?

512
01:02:37,527 --> 01:02:38,755
Don't panic.

513
01:02:39,007 --> 01:02:41,282
Fuck you. l'm not panicking.

514
01:02:41,367 --> 01:02:42,925
Come on then.

515
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:44,677
Come on.

516
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,155
OK, wait.

517
01:02:47,087 --> 01:02:48,600
You'lI be here, right?

518
01:02:50,087 --> 01:02:51,440
Come on, son.

519
01:02:52,447 --> 01:02:53,596
BismiIlah.

520
01:02:53,847 --> 01:02:55,758
Thanks, brother.

521
01:03:03,767 --> 01:03:05,519

01:03:30,527 --> 01:03:31,755
Get up.

523
01:03:33,767 --> 01:03:34,643
Move.

524
01:03:35,447 --> 01:03:36,436
Don't taIk.

525
01:03:37,527 --> 01:03:38,243
Wait-

526
01:03:38,447 --> 01:03:40,278
