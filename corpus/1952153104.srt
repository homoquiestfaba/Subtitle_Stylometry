1
00:01:04,144 --> 00:01:07,375
Darling David, where have
you been all my life?

2
00:01:08,548 --> 00:01:10,448
Where have you been,
where have you been?

3
00:01:10,484 --> 00:01:12,349
Where have you been?

4
00:01:14,588 --> 00:01:17,853
The only thing
I needed was this man.

5
00:01:19,025 --> 00:01:21,289
- Oh, Edie!
- What?

6
00:01:21,328 --> 00:01:22,886
What did you say, Edie?

7
00:01:22,929 --> 00:01:26,421
All I needed was
this man-- David.

8
00:01:40,781 --> 00:01:45,218
No, she was gorgeous.
Edie had everything.

9
00:01:45,252 --> 00:01:47,652
She doesn't remember
what she was.

10
00:01:49,823 --> 00:01:52,986
Everybody looks and thinks
and feels differently

11
00:01:53,026 --> 00:01:54,516
as the years go by.

12
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:15,542
Edie, look.

13
00:02:17,017 --> 00:02:19,485
Your wedding jewels,
Mother darling.

14
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:21,646
Yes.

15
00:02:22,923 --> 00:02:24,390
Here...

16
00:02:24,424 --> 00:02:26,324
do me up, chicken.

17
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:33,956
This might be the last
time I wear these.

18
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,558
Why?

19
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,831
Why?

20
00:02:38,872 --> 00:02:41,432
Because next time
this will be dangling

21
00:02:41,475 --> 00:02:44,273
from your neck, not mine.

22
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:46,211
And these--

23
00:02:46,246 --> 00:02:49,704
these will grace the ears

24
00:02:49,749 --> 00:02:52,980
of Mrs. J. Paul Getty.

25
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:54,509
Mother.

26
00:02:54,554 --> 00:02:56,749
''Mrs. J. Paul Getty.''

27
00:02:57,858 --> 00:03:00,122
That has a lovely ring to it.

28
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,128
Or Mrs. Jordan McClanahan.

29
00:03:02,162 --> 00:03:05,029
Now I hear he has
his eye on you.

30
00:03:05,065 --> 00:03:06,760
He's bound to propose
after tonight.

31
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:12,663
You look absolutely gorgeous.

32
00:03:12,706 --> 00:03:15,072
The doctor was right about
your hair growing back.

33
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:16,837
No one will notice.

34
00:03:16,877 --> 00:03:18,777
He also said that
it could all fall out

35
00:03:18,812 --> 00:03:20,370
again at any moment,
so I have that

36
00:03:20,413 --> 00:03:22,540
to look forward to,
haven't l?

37
00:03:22,582 --> 00:03:24,675
lt'll be fine.

38
00:03:24,718 --> 00:03:26,618
Now don't be long.

39
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:45,029
- Sir.
- Edith, you look divine.

40
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:46,629
Where's little Edie?

41
00:03:46,673 --> 00:03:48,732
- lsn't she ready yet?
- She needs a minute.

42
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:50,936
lt's been over an hour, darling.

43
00:03:50,977 --> 00:03:52,569
Well, you know Edie.

44
00:03:52,612 --> 00:03:55,206
Always the queen
of the dramatic pause.

45
00:03:55,248 --> 00:03:57,341
I suppose I could
entertain our guests

46
00:03:57,384 --> 00:04:00,353
with a little song while we wait.

47
00:04:00,387 --> 00:04:03,618
I prefer they don't leave
before Edie has been presented,

48
00:04:03,657 --> 00:04:05,818
but thank you, Edith.

49
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:07,827
Ah. There's our girl.

50
00:04:12,198 --> 00:04:15,031
Miss Beale,
they're ready for you.

51
00:04:29,482 --> 00:04:31,313
Edie!

52
00:04:32,485 --> 00:04:33,952
Edie.

53
00:04:33,987 --> 00:04:36,387
Come on back in.

54
00:04:36,423 --> 00:04:38,482
I can't.

55
00:04:38,525 --> 00:04:40,993
Edith, you'll never get
a man to propose to you

56
00:04:41,027 --> 00:04:43,393
if you don't have a debut.

57
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,523
And if you can't get
a man to propose to you,

58
00:04:45,565 --> 00:04:47,829
- well, you just--
- ''You might as well be dead''?

59
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:50,597
lf you don't get married,
how on earth

60
00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:52,764
do you plan to take care
of yourself?

61
00:04:52,806 --> 00:04:56,105
You know I want to be
an actress and a dancer.

62
00:04:57,577 --> 00:04:59,135
Once you married Father,

63
00:04:59,179 --> 00:05:01,977
he made you give up
your singing.

64
00:05:02,015 --> 00:05:03,778
I won't let that happen to me.

65
00:05:03,817 --> 00:05:05,375
I still sing,

66
00:05:05,418 --> 00:05:08,444
and I have a perfectly
marvelous marriage.

67
00:05:08,488 --> 00:05:10,854
When are you going
to learn, Edie?

68
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,518
You can have your cake
and eat it too in this life.

69
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,721
No, you can't, Mother darling.

70
00:05:15,762 --> 00:05:18,424
Edie, find a man

71
00:05:18,465 --> 00:05:20,729
who'll give you a long leash,

72
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,792
get married

73
00:05:22,836 --> 00:05:25,828
and then you can do
whatever you want.

74
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,701
Come on.

75
00:05:34,514 --> 00:05:37,381
How about
Mrs. Howard Hughes?

76
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:39,612
Too greasy.

77
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:42,019
You're absolutely right.

78
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,483
Edie? Oh, Edie!

79
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,545
Have you fed Buster?

80
00:06:15,588 --> 00:06:17,920
Yes, Mother,
I fed him his luncheon.

81
00:06:17,957 --> 00:06:20,517
Oh, there's a horrible smell.

82
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,289
I can hardly stand it.

83
00:06:22,328 --> 00:06:24,888
Oh, will you shut up?
lt's a goddamn beautiful day.

84
00:06:24,931 --> 00:06:27,058
Just shut up!

85
00:06:32,405 --> 00:06:35,499
Well, look what
the cat dragged in!

86
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:37,874
- lt's the Maysles.
- Hello, Edie.

87
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:40,038
I was just thinking
about you.

88
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,742
What brings you
out to Grey Gardens?

89
00:06:42,782 --> 00:06:46,183
We'd like to do a movie
just about you and your mother.

90
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:48,687
- Yeah.
- Really? What about the Bouvier movie?

91
00:06:48,722 --> 00:06:50,917
Well, Jackie's
probably too busy

92
00:06:50,957 --> 00:06:54,518
being Mrs. Aristotle
Onassis, huh?

93
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:58,122
Your cousin Lee sort of
lost interest in that and...

94
00:06:58,164 --> 00:06:59,722
pulled the plug.

95
00:06:59,766 --> 00:07:02,428
Oh, Al, that's terrible.

96
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:04,460
You and your mother
were the best part of it,

97
00:07:04,504 --> 00:07:06,301
to be perfectly honest.

98
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:10,036
Mother and I are
very entertaining, that's true.

99
00:07:11,544 --> 00:07:14,172
So this movie would just be
starring me and Mother,

100
00:07:14,214 --> 00:07:16,774
- no one else?
- That's the idea.

101
00:07:19,586 --> 00:07:22,487
Well, then it looks
like the Beales

102
00:07:22,522 --> 00:07:24,854
just stole
the Bouvier movie.

103
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:26,825
This is great.

104
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,919
This is going to be
my big chance--

105
00:07:28,962 --> 00:07:31,863
my chance to relaunch
my career.

106
00:07:32,866 --> 00:07:34,561
Edie!

107
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:38,269
The Maysles are back
to make a movie

108
00:07:38,304 --> 00:07:40,169
about us, Mother darling.

109
00:07:40,206 --> 00:07:42,197
Do you think your mother
will go along with it?

110
00:07:42,242 --> 00:07:45,040
lt's her house
and she has in it

111
00:07:45,078 --> 00:07:46,602
who she wants in it.

112
00:07:46,646 --> 00:07:48,113
You understand.

113
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:51,709
Oh my heart,
how perfectly flattering.

114
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:53,378
Hello, Mrs. Beale.

115
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:57,048
An old woman like me, no.

116
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,856
l'm not much
of an actress you know.

117
00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:09,192
So, boys, now explain to me:

118
00:08:09,235 --> 00:08:11,066
Exactly how would this work?

119
00:08:11,104 --> 00:08:14,437
ls there a script?
l'm a very quick study.

120
00:08:14,474 --> 00:08:16,305
Are you the director then, David?

121
00:08:16,342 --> 00:08:18,936
Well, no script. No director.

122
00:08:18,978 --> 00:08:21,503
lt's a documentary.
You just do what you do,

123
00:08:21,548 --> 00:08:23,413
and we just stay
in the background.

124
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:26,282
Just artists making
a film about artists.

125
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,584
We've always been mad
about the movies--

126
00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:32,216
''Gigi'' with Leslie Caron.

127
00:08:32,258 --> 00:08:35,625
Oh, marvelous.
Did you ever see that?

128
00:08:35,662 --> 00:08:37,357
- Of course.
- Yeah.

129
00:08:37,397 --> 00:08:40,730
lt all sounds terribly exciting.

130
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:43,759
And I assume
we'll share in the profits.

131
00:08:46,873 --> 00:08:49,967
To be honest,
the words ''documentary''

132
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:52,944
and ''profit'' don't usually end up
in the same sentence.

133
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:56,607
There's never been
one about us.

134
00:09:01,154 --> 00:09:03,122
l'm certain that
we can work something out.

135
00:09:03,156 --> 00:09:04,646
- We'll work something out.
- Yeah.

136
00:09:04,691 --> 00:09:07,023
And l'll need a clause
in my contract

137
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,654
that lets me do roles
in other movies.

138
00:09:10,897 --> 00:09:12,364
- Well, sure.
- Absolutely.

139
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:14,662
- I don't think that's--
- That's not a problem.

140
00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:21,569
Then that cements the deal.

141
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:41,019
- They're here already.
- Oh, my goodness.

142
00:09:44,597 --> 00:09:47,088
Buddy, Phelan.

143
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:49,101
Last one in is a rotten egg.

144
00:09:49,135 --> 00:09:50,500
Boys, no running
in the house.

145
00:09:50,536 --> 00:09:53,027
Good morning, Mr. Beale.

146
00:09:53,072 --> 00:09:55,973
- Hello, Robert.
- Hello, hello.

147
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:58,876
Molly!

148
00:09:58,912 --> 00:10:01,472
We didn't expect you till
later this afternoon.

149
00:10:01,514 --> 00:10:03,607
Oh, it's all right, Molly.
lt's okay.

150
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,676
- Hello.
- I just couldn't wait.

151
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:08,243
Go on.

152
00:10:31,477 --> 00:10:33,536
Edith.

153
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:36,104
Now this is
far too extravagant.

154
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:39,175
What you've got here is
a veritable army of--

155
00:10:39,218 --> 00:10:41,618
we're in the midst
of a depression, Edie.

156
00:10:41,654 --> 00:10:44,418
l've already had to let
half my staff go and...

157
00:10:44,457 --> 00:10:46,516
you're going to have to
cut back as well.

158
00:10:48,494 --> 00:10:52,123
lt takes many many hands
to run this house properly, Phelan.

159
00:10:52,165 --> 00:10:55,760
You can keep Molly and Frank
but the rest have to be dismissed.

160
00:10:55,802 --> 00:10:58,270
- What about Gould?
- What about him?

161
00:10:58,304 --> 00:11:02,263
You can't deprive the children
of their music lessons.

162
00:11:02,308 --> 00:11:04,401
That would be cruel.

163
00:11:05,445 --> 00:11:07,037
Fine.

164
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,776
Molly, Frank and Gould,

165
00:11:09,816 --> 00:11:11,716
but that's it.

166
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:14,652
Now as far as Edie is concerned...

167
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:17,884
please, get her engaged to a...

168
00:11:17,924 --> 00:11:19,687
stable person.

169
00:11:19,726 --> 00:11:22,286
Though l'm not sure
either one of you

170
00:11:22,328 --> 00:11:24,626
would know stable if it
walked through your soup.

171
00:11:24,664 --> 00:11:26,928
Well, whatever do you mean?

172
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:28,797
You know exactly
what I mean, Edith.

173
00:11:28,835 --> 00:11:30,132
She's unpredictable.

174
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:33,002
That stunt at the Pierre
did not go unnoticed.

175
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:35,439
Oh, Phelan, please.

176
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:37,067
She's high-spirited.

177
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,874
Well, whatever euphemism
you've got for it...

178
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,013
get her settled
in with a good family.

179
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,450
This is your job,

180
00:11:46,486 --> 00:11:48,477
your sole responsibility.

181
00:11:49,822 --> 00:11:52,382
What, you're
leaving already?

182
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:54,859
I have to work, Edith.

183
00:11:54,894 --> 00:11:57,226
Someone has to pay
for the Maidstone Club

184
00:11:57,263 --> 00:12:00,494
and all those goddamn
crab sandwiches.

185
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:03,297
And someone has to tend
to his secretary.

186
00:12:21,587 --> 00:12:23,418
Gould, you're here.

187
00:12:23,456 --> 00:12:25,219
Edith, darling.

188
00:12:27,493 --> 00:12:28,960
Oh, you look divine.

189
00:12:28,995 --> 00:12:31,361
Oh, so do you.

190
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:36,496
Are you in voice?

191
00:12:36,536 --> 00:12:38,197
I haven't practiced in ages.

192
00:12:38,237 --> 00:12:39,704
That's why l'm here, hmm?

193
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:42,299
Well, then l'm off.

194
00:12:43,409 --> 00:12:46,537
Children, say goodbye
to your father.

195
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:49,309
He's suddenly been
called back to the city.

196
00:12:49,348 --> 00:12:50,815
Already?

197
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,579
l'll see you
on the weekend.

198
00:12:52,618 --> 00:12:54,279
Goodbye, Buddy.

199
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,346
- Bye, little man.
- Goodbye, Father.

200
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,187
Can I come with you? Please.

201
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:01,750
lt's the summer, Edie.
There's no one your age in town.

202
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:03,887
But there's a dance class
l'd like to attend.

203
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,024
Just find yourself a nice fellow
from the Maidstone Club.

204
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:09,091
That's all you have to
focus on this summer.

205
00:13:09,135 --> 00:13:12,627
Oh, Father,
but they're just so dull.

206
00:13:12,672 --> 00:13:16,199
Edie... enough.

207
00:13:25,485 --> 00:13:28,318
That's a Spanish wall
garden over there.

208
00:13:28,354 --> 00:13:30,481
The Hills, they put that in.

209
00:13:30,523 --> 00:13:32,957
They imported
everything from Rome.

210
00:13:32,992 --> 00:13:35,483
Mrs. Hill, she was a famous, uh,

211
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:37,496
horticulturist.

212
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:40,522
That was one of the famous
gardens of America.

213
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:44,761
Edie, you look fantastic.

214
00:13:44,804 --> 00:13:47,102
David, you look
absolutely terrific.

215
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,576
Honestly.
You've got light blue on.

216
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,602
Well, Al,
you're still, um--

217
00:13:53,646 --> 00:13:56,376
Mother says
you're very conservative.

218
00:13:59,385 --> 00:14:02,047
This is the best thing
to wear for today, you understand,

219
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:05,080
because I don't like
women in skirts.

220
00:14:05,124 --> 00:14:08,025
And the best thing
is to wear pantyhose

221
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,552
or some pants under
a short skirt, I think.

222
00:14:11,597 --> 00:14:14,566
Then you have the pants
under the skirt.

223
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,591
And then you can pull
the stockings up

224
00:14:16,636 --> 00:14:19,730
over the pants,
underneath the skirt.

225
00:14:19,772 --> 00:14:22,866
And you can always take off
the skirt and use it as a cape,

226
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:25,503
so I think this is
the best costume for the day.

227
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:27,945
Okay.

228
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,438
l have to think
these things up, you know?

229
00:14:33,986 --> 00:14:35,851
Mother wanted me to come
out in a kimono,

230
00:14:35,888 --> 00:14:38,118
so we had
a quite a fight.

231
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:58,666
Al, was that good?
You want me to do that again?

232
00:15:14,293 --> 00:15:16,887
What a body, Beale.

233
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,025
''Smart and sleek, she sits,

234
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:25,435
Ready with her playful quips,

235
00:15:25,471 --> 00:15:27,632
Wondering who will
come her way

236
00:15:27,673 --> 00:15:29,538
To dine her,
to wine her,

237
00:15:29,575 --> 00:15:31,941
Which to snare to stay.''

238
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:35,374
William Blake.

239
00:15:35,414 --> 00:15:39,373
Edith Beale-- poet,
temptress, entertainer.

240
00:15:42,188 --> 00:15:43,917
That was great,
cousin Edie.

241
00:15:43,956 --> 00:15:45,856
Ah. lt's in
the Bouvier blood.

242
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:47,620
You can do it, too,
Jacqueline.

243
00:15:57,103 --> 00:15:59,333
Mr. Strong.

244
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,581
The children are
all at the beach.

245
00:16:12,785 --> 00:16:14,810
Shall we have our lesson?

246
00:16:16,088 --> 00:16:18,249
Of course, darling.

247
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,285
Let's.

248
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:25,126
How about this one?

249
00:17:08,574 --> 00:17:11,873
- Aren't they just divine?
- Divine.

250
00:17:30,262 --> 00:17:32,890
Brava.

251
00:17:32,932 --> 00:17:35,958
Should I tell them
about Gould?

252
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:38,936
Gould was mother's
accompanist.

253
00:17:38,971 --> 00:17:40,939
He was
a boogie-woogie composer

254
00:17:40,973 --> 00:17:42,804
with the most terrific style.

255
00:17:42,842 --> 00:17:45,504
He was the most
brilliant man I ever met--

256
00:17:45,544 --> 00:17:48,980
that's including Mr. Beale
and Mr. Bouvier.

257
00:17:49,014 --> 00:17:51,141
Completely brilliant.

258
00:17:56,188 --> 00:18:00,147
l came down here to live
in this-- this house...

259
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,156
because I did all
my singing here.

260
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:09,224
l was so happy.

261
00:18:09,268 --> 00:18:12,431
l was happier singing...

262
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:20,277
than anything l've ever done
since I was born.

263
00:18:22,481 --> 00:18:24,278
l liked it better...

264
00:18:27,386 --> 00:18:29,354
than anything I ever did.

265
00:20:47,826 --> 00:20:51,159
Come on, Edie, soft-shoe.
How can you resist?

266
00:21:22,828 --> 00:21:24,352
Whoo!

267
00:21:48,153 --> 00:21:50,917
Mr. Beale.

268
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:57,724
Edith!

269
00:22:05,938 --> 00:22:08,998
Mr. Beale,
what are you doing here?

270
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,440
lt's only Thursday.

271
00:22:10,476 --> 00:22:13,912
- lt's Friday, Edith.
- Oh.

272
00:22:13,946 --> 00:22:15,504
Get everyone
out of here...

273
00:22:15,547 --> 00:22:17,572
including him--

274
00:22:17,616 --> 00:22:19,607
goddamn Ganymede.

275
00:22:19,652 --> 00:22:21,711
l'm right here, Phelan.
l can hear you.

276
00:22:26,191 --> 00:22:29,524
All right, everyone,
time to go home.

277
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:31,290
Time to go home.

278
00:22:32,865 --> 00:22:34,662
Au revoir.

279
00:22:43,742 --> 00:22:46,074
You get away
from that door. Go.

280
00:22:46,111 --> 00:22:47,806
- Go.
- Come on, Edie.

281
00:22:47,846 --> 00:22:50,280
lt used to be charming, Edith.

282
00:22:50,315 --> 00:22:52,215
Now it's just sad.

283
00:22:52,251 --> 00:22:54,845
And what's that, Phelan?

284
00:22:56,488 --> 00:22:58,820
You're the mother
of my children, not a showgirl.

285
00:22:58,857 --> 00:23:02,725
And mothers can't sing?

286
00:23:02,761 --> 00:23:04,490
You know what I mean.

287
00:23:23,082 --> 00:23:24,982
Edie.

288
00:23:28,654 --> 00:23:30,588
Enough is enough.

289
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:33,781
l'm making a change.

290
00:23:33,826 --> 00:23:35,794
l'm putting the boys
in boarding school

291
00:23:35,828 --> 00:23:37,659
and l'm bringing little Edie
back to the city

292
00:23:37,696 --> 00:23:39,186
before you ruin her
altogether.

293
00:23:39,231 --> 00:23:41,756
Oh!

294
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,791
Ruin her.

295
00:23:43,836 --> 00:23:46,327
Why, because she was
dancing at a party?

296
00:23:46,371 --> 00:23:49,534
The priest said
she needs a strong hand.

297
00:23:49,575 --> 00:23:53,067
l'm sick and tired of this
conversation over and over.

298
00:23:54,713 --> 00:23:57,341
And where are you
in all this,

299
00:23:57,382 --> 00:23:59,850
Mr. Father of my children?

300
00:23:59,885 --> 00:24:01,352
l don't need this.

301
00:24:01,386 --> 00:24:03,820
Well, neither do l.

302
00:24:07,326 --> 00:24:09,692
Then you'll live
your life...

303
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,988
and l'll live mine.

304
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:16,598
With pleasure.

305
00:24:37,322 --> 00:24:39,119
Mother.

306
00:24:39,158 --> 00:24:40,523
Mother, please.

307
00:24:42,861 --> 00:24:44,692
Aren't you going
to say goodbye?

308
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,630
Why?

309
00:24:46,665 --> 00:24:48,326
Where are you going?

310
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:50,460
l'm going
to New York, Mother.

311
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:56,740
Why, that's just crazy.

312
00:24:56,775 --> 00:24:59,073
What are you going
to do in New York?

313
00:24:59,111 --> 00:25:02,239
l'm going to be
an actress and a dancer.

314
00:25:07,619 --> 00:25:09,484
And of course your father
is going to make

315
00:25:09,521 --> 00:25:12,012
all the introductions.

316
00:25:14,026 --> 00:25:16,392
ls that it?
Set you up?

317
00:25:16,428 --> 00:25:18,055
With all his

318
00:25:18,096 --> 00:25:21,122
show business connections
at the law firm?

319
00:25:24,703 --> 00:25:27,536
l worry
about you, babe.

320
00:25:27,573 --> 00:25:29,165
Stay here.

321
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:31,073
l'm strong.
You've always said that

322
00:25:31,109 --> 00:25:33,043
l was a staunch character,
remember?

323
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,070
- Stop that.
- Cut it out!

324
00:25:41,486 --> 00:25:43,886
l want your blessing,
Mother, please.

325
00:25:54,166 --> 00:25:56,100
Edith.

326
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,737
Edie, Edie.

327
00:26:05,811 --> 00:26:08,075
There's nothing there
that you can't get here.

328
00:26:09,915 --> 00:26:11,906
You can travel
the whole world

329
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,884
and you'll still never
find anything

330
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,910
as beautiful as right here.

331
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,885
Besides...

332
00:26:19,925 --> 00:26:22,416
Gould doesn't know
how to soft-shoe.

333
00:26:23,896 --> 00:26:25,761
Who am I going
to dance with?

334
00:26:35,374 --> 00:26:37,365
Goodbye, Mother.

335
00:26:43,649 --> 00:26:46,117
Edie! Oh, Edie!

336
00:26:47,486 --> 00:26:49,283
She never answers me,
that women.

337
00:26:50,956 --> 00:26:54,824
l suppose I won't get out
of here until she dies or I die.

338
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,487
Who's ''she,'' the cat?

339
00:26:56,528 --> 00:26:58,120
l don't know when
l'm going to get out of here.

340
00:26:58,163 --> 00:26:59,630
Why do you want
to get out?

341
00:26:59,665 --> 00:27:01,292
Because I like freedom.

342
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:03,233
Well, you can't get it, darling.

343
00:27:03,268 --> 00:27:05,634
You're being... supported.

344
00:27:05,671 --> 00:27:08,731
You can't get freedom
when you're being supported.

345
00:27:08,774 --> 00:27:11,334
l thought you always said
you can't get freedom

346
00:27:11,376 --> 00:27:13,844
when you're not being
supported, remember?

347
00:27:15,147 --> 00:27:18,878
lt's awful both ways,
l guess.

348
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:22,375
l'd just like a couple of days
on the beach. That's all.

349
00:27:22,421 --> 00:27:24,719
Everything is good
you didn't do.

350
00:27:24,756 --> 00:27:26,553
At the time
you didn't want it.

351
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,623
Everybody looks and thinks

352
00:27:30,662 --> 00:27:33,153
and feels differently
as the years go by.

353
00:27:35,734 --> 00:27:37,634
lt's very difficult
to keep the line

354
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:39,603
between the past
and the present.

355
00:27:41,406 --> 00:27:43,033
Awfully difficult.

356
00:28:24,883 --> 00:28:27,477
Hello, Father.
Sorry l'm late.

357
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,515
l've ordered for you.

358
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,526
So...

359
00:28:37,562 --> 00:28:39,291
- Yes?
- ...isn't this the part

360
00:28:39,331 --> 00:28:41,561
where you ask me
if l've met someone new?

361
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,830
Well, have you?

362
00:28:43,869 --> 00:28:46,133
l meet new people
all the time.

363
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:49,436
That's not what I meant
and you know it.

364
00:28:49,474 --> 00:28:52,443
l can't afford to support
you indefinitely, Edie.

365
00:28:52,477 --> 00:28:55,412
Who do you think pays
for women like you?

366
00:28:57,315 --> 00:28:58,805
- Men like me.
- ''Men like me.''

367
00:29:00,452 --> 00:29:02,249
Between your room
at the Barbizon

368
00:29:02,287 --> 00:29:04,619
and your allowance,
your mother's allowance--

369
00:29:04,656 --> 00:29:06,317
Your new fake wife's allowance.

370
00:29:06,358 --> 00:29:07,882
Don't be insolent.

371
00:29:10,829 --> 00:29:12,319
Do you want
this check or not?

372
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:16,430
And that position is still open

373
00:29:16,468 --> 00:29:19,301
at the law firm.

374
00:29:19,337 --> 00:29:22,033
You're a smart girl, Edie.

375
00:29:22,074 --> 00:29:25,373
And you're more than capable
of secretarial work.

376
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:28,641
l don't know why you can't
hold one of these jobs.

377
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,409
Just promise me

378
00:29:30,449 --> 00:29:32,212
you'll try to get
back on course.

379
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,409
Yes, Father.

380
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:39,723
At least you've given up that

381
00:29:39,758 --> 00:29:43,125
foolish notion of performing
your mother infected you with.

382
00:29:43,161 --> 00:29:45,425
Oh, yes, absolutely.

383
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,688
Who is that guy
at the third table?

384
00:30:12,157 --> 00:30:14,057
The name's Julius Krug.

385
00:30:14,092 --> 00:30:15,957
The Secretary of the lnterior?

386
00:30:15,994 --> 00:30:18,053
No idea.
Watch out, he's married.

387
00:30:20,765 --> 00:30:23,734
Heavens!
lt's Max Gordon.

388
00:30:23,768 --> 00:30:25,258
Who's that?

389
00:30:25,303 --> 00:30:27,703
You don't know
who Max Gordon is?

390
00:30:27,739 --> 00:30:29,400
He's a famous producer.

391
00:30:37,582 --> 00:30:39,277
Max Gordon discovered
Judy Holliday

392
00:30:39,317 --> 00:30:41,649
and is generally considered
the king of Broadway.

393
00:30:47,058 --> 00:30:49,549
lt is a beautiful ocean
today, isn't it?

394
00:30:52,164 --> 00:30:53,825
What color would
you say it was?

395
00:30:55,267 --> 00:30:56,757
Blue.

396
00:30:58,236 --> 00:31:00,500
You're absolutely right.

397
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:02,029
Sapphire.

398
00:31:03,808 --> 00:31:06,276
Oh, this is the most
beautiful place on earth.

399
00:31:09,214 --> 00:31:11,876
l don't know how anyone
could prefer New York City.

400
00:31:20,292 --> 00:31:22,692
l'm terribly sorry
to interrupt your luncheon,

401
00:31:22,727 --> 00:31:25,287
but I know we haven't been
properly introduced.

402
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:28,663
l'm Edith Bouvier Beale
and you're Max Gordon.

403
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,363
Thank you. l'd had a few
of these and I started to wonder.

404
00:31:32,404 --> 00:31:35,168
l hear you're on the lookout
for the next great actress.

405
00:31:35,207 --> 00:31:38,074
l am casting
a new musical this summer.

406
00:31:38,109 --> 00:31:40,236
l just adore musicals

407
00:31:40,278 --> 00:31:42,473
and I do terrific dances.

408
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:02,658
l was doing the V.M.l.
marching song,

409
00:32:02,701 --> 00:32:05,033
which is a ground maneuver,
and when I do that,

410
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,402
see, that's when
the plane goes by.

411
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:09,930
You're quite the comedienne.
You're funnier than Judy Holliday.

412
00:32:09,975 --> 00:32:12,569
We're holding auditions at
the Guild Theater at the end of July.

413
00:32:12,611 --> 00:32:14,977
Ring my office,
put yourself on the list for a shot.

414
00:32:15,013 --> 00:32:17,481
Well, l'll try to squeeze it in.

415
00:32:17,515 --> 00:32:19,244
Thank you, Mr. Gordon.

416
00:32:19,284 --> 00:32:21,912
Thank you very much.

417
00:32:21,953 --> 00:32:24,251
Thank you.

418
00:32:24,289 --> 00:32:25,881
Cute gal.

419
00:32:30,562 --> 00:32:32,723
- Miss Beale.
- Yeah?

420
00:32:32,764 --> 00:32:35,494
That was quite the little routine
you put on in there.

421
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:37,728
Why, thank you, Mr.--

422
00:32:37,769 --> 00:32:40,932
Krug. Please call me Cap.
Everybody does.

423
00:32:40,972 --> 00:32:43,600
Cap, that's marvelous.

424
00:32:43,642 --> 00:32:45,439
l was named
after my mother.

425
00:32:45,477 --> 00:32:47,468
She's also Edith.

426
00:32:50,181 --> 00:32:52,206
Would you have dinner
with me, Edith?

427
00:32:56,087 --> 00:32:57,577
Lunch?

428
00:32:59,057 --> 00:33:00,524
Dessert?

429
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:03,322
You could take me dancing.

430
00:33:05,864 --> 00:33:07,388
Come on, Pinky.

431
00:33:08,733 --> 00:33:12,726
$658.48 to the Maidstone Club.

432
00:33:14,739 --> 00:33:16,138
Edith, let's just cancel it.

433
00:33:16,174 --> 00:33:19,166
No, when Edie comes home
she'll want to go.

434
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:23,203
- Edith, she's not coming home.
- Don't say that.

435
00:33:23,248 --> 00:33:26,445
l'll pay for it
out of the Bouvier trust.

436
00:33:28,453 --> 00:33:30,011
Next.

437
00:33:30,055 --> 00:33:34,014
Here's one from P.C.
Shank & Sons for $89.27

438
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:35,720
for the heating oil.

439
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,888
Send that one
to my husband.

440
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,398
l already did last month.

441
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:43,128
Your husband's wife
sent it back.

442
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:45,728
l am not in the mood
for this, Gould.

443
00:33:47,806 --> 00:33:49,569
Not now.
We'll finish later.

444
00:33:52,544 --> 00:33:54,068
Gould.

445
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,870
Yes, Edith.

446
00:33:58,783 --> 00:34:00,580
You know
l'd be lost without you.

447
00:34:03,822 --> 00:34:06,086
And I you, darling.

448
00:34:07,592 --> 00:34:09,253
Like a moth to the flame.

449
00:34:14,065 --> 00:34:16,260
And what's a moth
without a flame?

450
00:34:25,043 --> 00:34:27,273
Dancing isn't exactly my forte.

451
00:34:27,312 --> 00:34:28,973
You're doing just fine.

452
00:34:33,985 --> 00:34:35,680
So what's he like?

453
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,086
- Who?
- President Truman.

454
00:34:38,123 --> 00:34:40,683
He and I didn't see eye to eye
on certain things so l...

455
00:34:40,725 --> 00:34:42,625
stepped down
from his cabinet.

456
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:46,096
Oh, I just adore politics.

457
00:34:47,632 --> 00:34:49,259
How is it you haven't
been snapped up

458
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,165
up by some eligible
bachelor yet, Edith?

459
00:34:51,202 --> 00:34:53,432
Oh, l've sworn
off bachelors.

460
00:34:53,471 --> 00:34:55,200
What do you have
against bachelors?

461
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,800
They're boring, inconsiderate,

462
00:34:57,842 --> 00:34:59,867
pigheaded, stubborn,
spoiled mama's boys

463
00:34:59,911 --> 00:35:01,606
who think they have
a premium on women,

464
00:35:01,646 --> 00:35:03,238
which unfortunately they have,

465
00:35:03,281 --> 00:35:05,374
there being so many
of us girls around.

466
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:07,578
Hang on.

467
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:11,578
But one has got to make
the most in a difficult situation,

468
00:35:11,623 --> 00:35:14,114
and that's why women
in desperation

469
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:16,423
have turned
to the married man.

470
00:35:16,461 --> 00:35:19,191
Married men are
generous and discreet,

471
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:22,222
they don't make a fuss,
they don't stick around

472
00:35:22,267 --> 00:35:24,428
and they let you have
a career if you want one.

473
00:35:25,637 --> 00:35:27,332
Most girls would be jealous.

474
00:35:27,372 --> 00:35:30,500
Most girls aren't Edith Beale.

475
00:35:33,812 --> 00:35:36,542
All I want in life, Mr. Krug,

476
00:35:36,581 --> 00:35:38,173
is a dance partner.

477
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,311
Goodbye, Edith.

478
00:37:46,778 --> 00:37:48,678
Shh!

479
00:37:48,713 --> 00:37:51,443
Oh my gosh, you're like
a bull in a china shop.

480
00:37:51,482 --> 00:37:53,416
- Do you want to get caught?
- l'm sorry.

481
00:37:53,451 --> 00:37:55,146
Oh, God,
if they find you here

482
00:37:55,186 --> 00:37:57,245
l'll be out on the streets,
no questions asked.

483
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,080
What's that?

484
00:38:09,567 --> 00:38:12,968
Oh, Cap, it's divine.

485
00:38:15,073 --> 00:38:18,668
- But it's far too generous.
- lt suits you.

486
00:38:21,346 --> 00:38:23,837
So you've bought me now,
is that it?

487
00:38:23,881 --> 00:38:26,247
Of course not, Eade.

488
00:38:26,284 --> 00:38:27,945
l just love
to see you shine.

489
00:38:32,056 --> 00:38:35,890
- lt's exciting.
- Oh, don't.

490
00:38:35,927 --> 00:38:38,088
l ate too much.

491
00:38:38,129 --> 00:38:40,359
l have to lose weight
before the audition.

492
00:38:47,672 --> 00:38:49,663
Aw, my angel, Cap.

493
00:38:51,209 --> 00:38:52,972
Who ever said
you can't have it all?

494
00:38:54,112 --> 00:38:56,012
lt wasn't Edith Beale.

495
00:39:02,453 --> 00:39:05,354
- Hello, Mother. Yeah.
- Edie.

496
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:07,915
What was that?

497
00:39:07,959 --> 00:39:09,927
l just knocked over a glass.

498
00:39:11,396 --> 00:39:14,593
Have you replied to
Mrs. Cabot's party invitation yet?

499
00:39:14,632 --> 00:39:16,122
No-- I mean yes.

500
00:39:16,167 --> 00:39:18,067
l sent my regrets.
l don't want to travel

501
00:39:18,102 --> 00:39:21,003
all the way out to East Hampton
for just one party.

502
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:23,974
Well, it wouldn't be
just for that, I hope.

503
00:39:24,008 --> 00:39:26,772
- I miss you, chicken.
- I miss you too, Mother,

504
00:39:26,811 --> 00:39:28,574
but I really must go.

505
00:39:28,613 --> 00:39:31,377
lt's just that
l'm pressing my blouse

506
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:32,940
and it's going to burn.

507
00:39:32,984 --> 00:39:35,475
lt's a bit late
to go out now.

508
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,817
Oh no, Mother.

509
00:39:36,854 --> 00:39:39,152
lt's burning.

510
00:39:40,258 --> 00:39:43,489
- Edie?
- Tomorrow.

511
00:39:43,528 --> 00:39:46,019
Tomorrow.
We'll talk again tomorrow.

512
00:39:46,064 --> 00:39:48,055
No. Edie?

513
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:53,632
l love you too, Edie.

514
00:39:58,109 --> 00:40:01,169
Can you believe he said
l was funnier than Judy Holliday?

515
00:40:01,212 --> 00:40:04,670
- And prettier.
- He didn't say that.

516
00:40:04,716 --> 00:40:07,583
Well...

517
00:40:07,618 --> 00:40:09,108
he should have.

518
00:40:13,124 --> 00:40:16,116
l flirt, but it's all talk.

519
00:40:24,469 --> 00:40:26,096
Mostly.

520
00:40:29,974 --> 00:40:31,464
l wish l'd met you before.

521
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:34,300
Oh, Cap.

522
00:40:43,121 --> 00:40:46,613
She knows that l'm here.

523
00:40:46,657 --> 00:40:48,648
lndeed.

524
00:40:52,096 --> 00:40:55,327
- Yes, Mother?
- Listen, babe, I was thinking--

525
00:40:56,934 --> 00:40:58,526
were you running?

526
00:40:58,569 --> 00:41:01,060
No, I just got
out of the tub

527
00:41:01,105 --> 00:41:03,232
and ran to the phone.

528
00:41:03,274 --> 00:41:05,435
Have you got
a man there, Edie?

529
00:41:05,476 --> 00:41:07,410
No, of course not.

530
00:41:07,445 --> 00:41:09,675
But so what if I had?

531
00:41:09,714 --> 00:41:12,182
Why don't you
bring him home?

532
00:41:12,216 --> 00:41:14,480
l'd like to meet
this nice young man.

533
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:18,751
No, stop pressuring me
to come home. l'm getting work.

534
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:21,384
And l'm just about to get
an audition with--

535
00:41:21,425 --> 00:41:23,154
are you sitting down?

536
00:41:23,194 --> 00:41:26,823
Max Gordon.
The Max Gordon.

537
00:41:26,864 --> 00:41:28,923
l danced for him,
he went to pieces.

538
00:41:30,735 --> 00:41:32,600
He's married.

539
00:41:32,637 --> 00:41:34,161
Well, I don't know
if he's married,

540
00:41:34,205 --> 00:41:35,695
but what does that matter?

541
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:38,334
Mr. Gordon is
a very prominent producer.

542
00:41:38,376 --> 00:41:40,901
Oh, no no no
no no, Edie.

543
00:41:40,945 --> 00:41:42,469
l don't mean him.

544
00:41:43,481 --> 00:41:44,971
l mean your visitor.

545
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:48,716
- He's married, isn't he?
- Mother.

546
00:41:48,753 --> 00:41:52,348
No, Edie, married men
will only break your heart.

547
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:55,154
l'm fine. l'm happier
than l've ever been.

548
00:41:55,193 --> 00:41:58,685
You know that stress makes
your hair fall out.

549
00:41:59,864 --> 00:42:02,992
- Remember?
- Mother, l've got to go.

550
00:42:12,743 --> 00:42:16,406
Ooh, I think
she's onto us!

551
00:42:24,889 --> 00:42:26,516
- Phelan?
- Yes.

552
00:42:26,557 --> 00:42:30,288
lt's me.
l have some news.

553
00:42:30,328 --> 00:42:32,558
ls this about
the check? Because--

554
00:42:32,597 --> 00:42:36,226
No no no,
it's not about the bills.

555
00:42:36,267 --> 00:42:37,757
lt's about your daughter.

556
00:42:44,909 --> 00:42:47,673
Miss Beale?

557
00:42:47,712 --> 00:42:49,339
Your father's here.

558
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,178
He's waiting downstairs
for you in the lobby.

559
00:42:52,216 --> 00:42:55,379
- My God, we fell asleep.
- Oh God.

560
00:42:55,419 --> 00:42:58,752
Here.

561
00:43:02,793 --> 00:43:06,354
- Do you remember this?
- May I see that please?

562
00:43:06,397 --> 00:43:08,797
The villain of the piece.

563
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:12,234
''To my best friend
and most delightful comrade,

564
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:14,898
to my only sweetheart
and wonderful wife,

565
00:43:14,939 --> 00:43:17,669
l tender this likeness
of her husband,

566
00:43:17,708 --> 00:43:19,767
Phelan Beale, 1929.''

567
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:22,005
Did I laugh
when I read that.

568
00:43:22,046 --> 00:43:23,513
Aren't kids terrible?

569
00:43:23,547 --> 00:43:25,276
l just roared.

570
00:43:29,287 --> 00:43:33,246
l lived alone
at least 30 years. I didn't mind.

571
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:37,593
You get to
be very independent

572
00:43:37,628 --> 00:43:39,323
when you live alone.

573
00:43:40,598 --> 00:43:43,590
You get to be
a real individual.

574
00:43:43,634 --> 00:43:46,933
You can't have your cake
and eat it too in life.

575
00:43:46,971 --> 00:43:49,599
Oh, yes, I did. I did.

576
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,301
l had my cake,

577
00:43:51,342 --> 00:43:55,005
loved it,
masticated it, chewed it.

578
00:43:55,046 --> 00:43:57,776
l had everything I wanted.

579
00:43:57,815 --> 00:44:00,181
She was bored.
She couldn't stand it.

580
00:44:00,217 --> 00:44:02,412
No, I was not.
l was a great singer.

581
00:44:03,688 --> 00:44:05,747
l had
a perfect marriage,

582
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:07,314
beautiful children.

583
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:09,758
l had a terribly
successful marriage.

584
00:44:09,794 --> 00:44:13,093
No, I never had
a fight in my life.

585
00:44:14,398 --> 00:44:16,764
l never threw anything
at Mr. Beale, never.

586
00:44:18,469 --> 00:44:20,460
No, l-- I never--

587
00:44:20,504 --> 00:44:22,870
never had words with--

588
00:44:23,975 --> 00:44:25,704
with Mr. Beale at all.

589
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,446
Edie, why don't you show
the Maysles the beach?

590
00:44:34,352 --> 00:44:37,048
Do you boys want
to see the ocean?

591
00:44:37,088 --> 00:44:38,749
- Sure.
- Come on.

592
00:45:02,046 --> 00:45:05,209
Tickets please.

593
00:45:24,535 --> 00:45:27,971
Edie, this will be better
for you-- you can swim,

594
00:45:28,005 --> 00:45:32,135
fresh air. lt's too hot in town.
You love the ocean.

595
00:45:32,176 --> 00:45:33,939
Edie, please.

596
00:45:36,013 --> 00:45:37,708
Edie!

597
00:45:37,748 --> 00:45:39,739
Please say goodbye.

598
00:47:06,837 --> 00:47:09,931
Good evening.
Grey Gardens.

599
00:47:09,974 --> 00:47:12,966
l'll have a look to see
if Mrs. Beale is at home.

600
00:47:14,979 --> 00:47:18,608
Thank you, Molly.
l've got it.

601
00:47:18,649 --> 00:47:20,583
This is Mrs. Beale.

602
00:47:20,618 --> 00:47:22,210
May I speak
with Edith, please?

603
00:47:22,253 --> 00:47:24,050
To whom am I speaking?

604
00:47:24,088 --> 00:47:26,249
- Julius Krug.
- Oh.

605
00:47:29,026 --> 00:47:32,985
A Mr. Julius Krug
for you, dear.

606
00:47:49,346 --> 00:47:51,507
Cap?

607
00:47:51,549 --> 00:47:52,948
What happened to you?

608
00:47:52,983 --> 00:47:56,646
l'm stuck here
at my mother's house.

609
00:47:56,687 --> 00:47:58,518
Are you all right?

610
00:47:58,556 --> 00:48:00,217
- l'm fine.
- Okay.

611
00:48:00,257 --> 00:48:01,724
When are you going
to be back?

612
00:48:01,759 --> 00:48:03,784
Well, that's just it--
l don't know.

613
00:48:03,827 --> 00:48:06,557
l have my audition
on Tuesday morning.

614
00:48:06,597 --> 00:48:09,157
l just have to make
it back by then.

615
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,998
l'll take you to lunch
afterwards to celebrate.

616
00:48:12,036 --> 00:48:14,368
Meet me
at the Hampshire House.

617
00:48:14,405 --> 00:48:15,872
Cap.

618
00:48:15,906 --> 00:48:19,899
- Yes, Edie?
- I l-- um...

619
00:48:22,012 --> 00:48:25,243
- I know. Me too.
- Cap.

620
00:48:26,951 --> 00:48:29,784
Never say that right after
l say that, okay?

621
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:32,880
l never want to wonder
if you thought you had to say it.

622
00:48:32,923 --> 00:48:34,754
But I didn't say it.

623
00:48:37,161 --> 00:48:38,651
Right.

624
00:48:40,864 --> 00:48:42,661
l'll see you there.

625
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,260
- Good night.
- Goodbye.

626
00:48:53,277 --> 00:48:55,336
He sounded
awfully married to me.

627
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:18,498
Edie!

628
00:49:19,937 --> 00:49:21,928
Edie, come here.

629
00:49:21,972 --> 00:49:23,837
What's wrong, Mother?

630
00:49:23,874 --> 00:49:26,968
- Where've you been, woman?
- Paris, Mother.

631
00:49:27,011 --> 00:49:30,105
Look. Kitties.
Little baby kitties.

632
00:49:34,752 --> 00:49:36,845
Marvelous. Here.

633
00:49:36,887 --> 00:49:38,980
Look at this one.

634
00:49:39,023 --> 00:49:42,015
- And this one.
- Poor old Pink.

635
00:49:42,059 --> 00:49:44,050
She must be starving.

636
00:49:45,329 --> 00:49:47,160
Pinky, are you hungry?

637
00:49:47,197 --> 00:49:49,358
We're out of cat food.

638
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,425
l'll go into town,
get some more.

639
00:49:57,374 --> 00:50:01,333
Oh, Edie! Edie!

640
00:50:01,378 --> 00:50:05,109
Get some ice cream.
We'll celebrate.

641
00:50:05,149 --> 00:50:07,140
Yes, Mother darling.

642
00:51:34,304 --> 00:51:36,636
Give that to Mr. Krug,
right away.

643
00:51:36,673 --> 00:51:38,197
Oh, and your name, miss?

644
00:51:40,911 --> 00:51:44,506
- Judy Holliday.
- Of course.
