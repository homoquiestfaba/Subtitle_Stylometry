1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,160
Dan, in five minutes.

2
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,390
<i>Daniel.
Let's begin.</i>

3
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,950
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.
Daniel Tosh.</i>

4
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,990
Thank you. Thank you.

5
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,000
I deserve that.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,900
I'm really good. One of the best.
That's yeah, the best.

7
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,900
Currently ranked number
one in the world.

8
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,900
So buckle up, you guys are in for a treat.

9
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,900
19000 people. This is awesome.

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,330
Thank you.
Seriously don't look around.

11
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,330
It's 19,000.
People watching the TV they

12
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,970
never know. They're so stupid.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,240
That's why they watch TV.

14
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,100
It's great to be here in the OC.

15
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,100
Diversity.
That's what I like about the OC.

16
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,470
You know between upper middle
and upper. My people.

17
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,220
Oh, there anything more
annoying than the poor?

18
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:33,620
Always complaining: <i>"Aw, I can't
afford a two-bedroom townhouse</i>

19
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,290
<i>for six hundred thousand dollars."</i>
Good, move east.

20
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,850
Yeah, that's what the middle of the
country's for. People that gave up on

21
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,999
their dreams. Oh, that's gonna,
sting isn't, tourist?

22
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:53,020
Alright, how much longer do I have--
holy cow!

23
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:58,770
That opening did not take long
enough. We have another 55 minutes.

24
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,000
I tell you how long I've been on
stage. I think that's nice.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,259
I don't have to. Ever been in church:
<i>"Hey, when's this fucker going to</i>

26
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,009
<i>wrap it up? We got kick off!</i>

27
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,720
<i>Why does God hate
football season?</i>

28
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,720
<i>I wish he was arrested
on a Wednesday.</i>

29
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,580
It's so hard to be a Christian in
the west coast time zone.

30
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:34,420
I probably shouldn't talk about church
and say fucking in the same sentence.

31
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:39,880
Or on Comedy Central. They don't want
me to swear. But, I love to swear and I

32
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,140
don't know that I'm not allowed to swear.
Right? What if I die get up to heaven

33
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,140
and God's like: <i>"Hey,
man. Welcome to fuckin' heaven."</i>

34
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,859
<i>"Oh, my. What did you say?"</i>
He's like: <i>"Welcome to fucking heaven."</i>

35
00:02:51,859 --> 00:02:53,859
<i>"You can swear?"</i>

36
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:58,450
He's like: <i>"Fuck yeah!
It's fucking heaven."</i>

37
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:02,300
<i>"Oh, see I was always raised
as a child never to swear."</i>

38
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,100
<i>"Where in the Bible does it say
you can't fucking swear?"</i>

39
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,850
I'm like: <i>"No fucking where."</i> He's like:
<i>"Yeah. Now you're getting it.</i>

40
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,700
<i>By the way I saw some slutty bitches
by the pearly gates. You can go tap that.</i>

41
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,760
<i>They ain't getting in."</i>
I'm like: <i>"What?"</i>

42
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,760
He's like: <i>"No, I'm kidding.
You're not in heaven.</i>

43
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:24,970
<i>You're in hell. You're on PUNK'D."</i>
Oh, damn you, Ashton.

44
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,480
That one was elaborate.

45
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:35,290
Way to go the extra mile. Even in
the afterlife you're a douchebag.

46
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,320
Hope you enjoy charity banging
that geriatric for eternity.

47
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:45,109
Am I right? It's so gross. <i>"I hope
I get famous in my early 20 so I</i>

48
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:47,980
<i>can settle down and marry some
middle-aged forty-year-old with a</i>

49
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:53,179
<i>bunch of kids. That'll throw off the
scent of the gay trail."</i> Haha.

50
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:57,180
I guess it has, I guess it has.

51
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:03,250
Women like that Demi married a younger
man because guys do it all the time

52
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,310
and no one gives him grief for, but if
a woman does it becomes an issue.

53
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:11,950
OK. But the flip side of that is how about
when a hot female teacher bangs a 14

54
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,760
year old student and nobody in society
really has a problem with it. They all

55
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,668
the same stupid joke: <i>"Probably made
the kid more popular."</i> That's disgusting.

56
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,370
She's a pedophile, she should
be in prison forever.

57
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,870
I dated a teacher in high school.
Yeah, it didn't make me cooler.

58
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:35,680
And a lot of you're like: <i>"That's
because you were home schooled."</i> Ok.

59
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,760
Valid. Valid point.

60
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,480
Doesn't mean I'm a bad person.
It just means statistically
I'm smarter than you are.

61
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,740
And I had game.

62
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,340
A leopard can carry two
times its body weight into a tree.

63
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:03,670
I don't have a joke for that yet. But it
is accurate and just in case you hate my

64
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:08,200
stand-up at least you can leave going:
<i>"You know what I learned something.</i>

65
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,000
<i>That guy's like a damn Snapple."</i> Right?
You might not like the flavor, but once

66
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,870
you pop the top you're:
<i>"Ohhh, the Sun is hot!</i>

67
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,870
<i>45 million degrees Fahrenheit!
It feels warmer.</i>

68
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,990
<i>Tahoe's west of LA?
Bullshit, Snapple!"</i>

69
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:30,370
Then I saw a globe and I'm like: <i>"I'm
sorry, Snapple. You are always right."</i>

70
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,390
Got to seal up the borders in this
country that's for sure.

71
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:46,010
Yeah, I'm not talking about Mexico,
either. I love Mexico.

72
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:50,000
Beautiful beaches and fifty dollars
never bought me so much weed.

73
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:55,170
Sure, there were branches in it. I don't
care. In a garbage bag.

74
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:58,170
I was king for a day.

75
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,630
I'm talking about Canada. Stay in your
own yard.

76
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:09,729
I'm so sick of these Canadians down
here. Always complaining, right?

77
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:14,709
<i>"It's nice here but I couldn't live here.
I love seasons, too much. I love seasons."</i>

78
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:18,990
So do I. That's why I live in a place
that skips the shitty ones.

79
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:24,689
Because, I love seasons.

80
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:29,529
Why don't you ice skate your
ass back up to your log cabin

81
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:33,519
and enjoy that
10-month dead period?

82
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:39,179
Where you get to stay inside day
after day and eventually have to stab

83
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:41,549
your wife to death that just so
you can see some color.

84
00:06:41,549 --> 00:06:48,109
Oh, that's my favorite season. Where
your wife is lying dead on the floor.

85
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:56,590
Those reds! Am I right? It's like
Maine. We should get lobster.

86
00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:04,559
I don't think I could ever stab somebody
because I'm really bad with the Capri Sun.

87
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:12,959
And other reasons that even
fewer would laugh at. No? Okay.

88
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:21,809
No Juicy, Juicy, Juicy.
This is my water.

89
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:25,000
This is gonna be exciting.

90
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,380
I wish it didn't have that many
rotations to take the lid off.

91
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:35,610
Had I known that I would have
pre-screwed it two turns.

92
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:43,990
Sometimes I feel bad because secretly
I hope New Orleans gets nailed again.

93
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:48,800
But, but, but, but, then I don't.

94
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:52,890
What? You'd rather spend billions

95
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,809
rebuilding the city that's
below sea level?

96
00:07:54,809 --> 00:08:00,559
I've got another business plan. Cut our
losses and finish the job, Lord.

97
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:02,859
I'm sorry s-- one guy.

98
00:08:02,859 --> 00:08:06,200
Yeah, that's like: <i>"You know
what, I came to a comedy club.</i>

99
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:11,890
<i>I hope there's jokes and sarcasm."</i>
The rest of you are...

100
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:16,500
I'm a half full guy. New Orleans gets
flooded, I said to myself:

101
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:20,389
<i>"If any city in this country
needed a bath, it was New Orleans.</i>

102
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:22,919
That. Cajuns are dirty.
That's a fact.

103
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:26,150
That's French and redneck merging.

104
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:30,150
That's a hygiene combination
no antiperspirant can tackle.

105
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:39,740
And I'm not-- I'm not somebody that
doesn't understand why you would "oh".

106
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,320
We had a horrible tragedy in our country,
that's not bad enough. What's right

107
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,580
around the corner to make everything
worse? Blatant racism. And it was obvious

108
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,180
in New Orleans. We all know it wasn't
just black people looting, that's for sure.

109
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,390
There were tons of Mexicans there.

110
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,590
There were. And nobody was
pointing the finger.

111
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,250
I will. I see a Jose.

112
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,400
<i>"Drop the VCR! The hell are
you stealing a VCR for, anyway?</i>

113
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,300
<i>They don't even make VHS tapes.</i>

114
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,000
<i>Why don't you steal a TiVo?
That's what I would steal."</i>

115
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,310
But, I don't have to because
I'm white and I've had one for 3 years.

116
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,920
That's-- That's not racial. That's a fact.

117
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,920
I've almost had one for 4 years.
I'm not gonna say that.

118
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,160
How does that make the joke better?
<i>"I've had a TiVo for 4 years."</i>

119
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,160
<i>"Who's the dick?"</i>

120
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,660
So I say three years
to soften it.

121
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,949
Wherever you live there's risk. I
mean we accept that. We live here.

122
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:37,460
Oh, California. We have earthquakes,
mudslides. The rest of the country thinks

123
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,550
it's hysterical: <i>"Haha! That's what
you guys get for building your</i>

124
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,750
<i>houses on the side of cliffs."</i>

125
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,750
That's because we have
shit to look at, Tulsa.

126
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,689
Why don't you keep your mouth
shut and enjoy that new strip mall?

127
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:57,910
Oh, I hear they're gonna put a Chili's
in it. That's gonna be super sweet.

128
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,969
On thursdays they're doing
2 4 and appetizers.

129
00:09:59,969 --> 00:10:01,930
I'm gonna go Pizza Pop where
you get spinach artichoke dip.

130
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,100
I wanna get chicken fingers. You're
chicken Caesar salad.

131
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,980
It's a different kind of chicken.

132
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,900
Oh, that joke was long
and worth it.

133
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:17,849
Do you know who
loves to get fisted?

134
00:10:17,849 --> 00:10:19,849
Sock puppets.

135
00:10:21,849 --> 00:10:24,849
That joke is adorable.

136
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:28,520
I wrote that joke so children could
watch my show on TV

137
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,550
and not be embarrassed in
front of their parents.

138
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,850
I was watching the country music
channel the other day and

139
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:41,640
I fell asleep and I woke up racist.

140
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,640
Ah, that explains the
holes in my linens.

141
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,209
Saw a guy driving on the highway
with his bare foot out the window.

142
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:55,699
Can we agree that that's disgusting?
Right, so I was gonna pull next to him

143
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,610
to scream at him and then I realized
it was an amputee making a left.

144
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:05,150
I know but I already started to yell
so I'm: <i>"Oh, your blinkers out!"</i>

145
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,790
And he waved or kicked.

146
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,349
Received the information.

147
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:16,749
If anybody ever asks you for directions
and you have to point, point with 4 fingers.

148
00:11:16,749 --> 00:11:19,760
The look on their face will be the
funniest thing you saw all day long.

149
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,760
Just be: <i>"Oh, yeah. It's over there."</i>

150
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:27,500
<i>"Are you yelling at me?"</i>

151
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,850
<i>"No. Just go that way to the left.
That's how you get there.</i>

152
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:35,570
<i>Well, then you should have
asked the walrus."</i>

153
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:45,890
My girlfriend is Korean for this joke.

154
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,890
And we met online
and people make jokes

155
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:51,340
about it but that's not
how eBay works.

156
00:11:51,340 --> 00:12:00,340
You research, wait for one without a
reserve. None of this buy it now.

157
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,140
I don't have a girlfriend, oh.

158
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:06,000
She got so mad. She hated I
that always corrected her.

158
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,800
And I told her: <i>"How do you think
it made me feel? Knowing I was dating
someone who was always wrong?"

158
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,560
And I'm in show business.

159
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,559
Oh, she would get so jealous when
I cheated on her.

160
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,160
And I would tell her:
<i>"Maybe if you</i>

161
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,940
<i>had a better body,
I wouldn't have to.</i>

162
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:26,170
<i>Instead of 'Ohing', why don't you get
on a treadmill, put on 8 with an incline</i>

163
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,349
<i>because I'm not gonna stick around with
back fat."</i> And she's like: <i>"I'm not fat,</i>

164
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:33,120
<i>I'm pregnant."</i>
I'm like: <i>"Whatever. It's gross.</i>

165
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:37,120
<i>Now make me a sandwich."</i>
Then I give her kidney shot.

166
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,660
Not a hard one. Just so <i>"You know I
love honey turkey."</i> POW!

167
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,660
<i>"He likes turkey. I need more
iron in my diet."</i>

168
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,939
That's a bruise joke.

169
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,000
People are like: <i>"Oh, he
punched a pregnant girlfriend."</i>

170
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,190
She wasn't pregnant.
She's pro choice.

171
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:02,040
Does that make you uncomfortable? Move
to South Dakota. Hear they're taking rights.

172
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,070
You know that South Dakota is the
first state in our country to make

173
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:07,240
abortion completely illegal.

174
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,240
And it doesn't affect me because
good luck finding someone

175
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,010
in South Dakota that I'd have sex with.

176
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,010
Have you seen them?

177
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:20,529
There is no talent on that team.
That's a AAA club at best.

177
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:23,309
And if you're not pro-choice, all that
means you've never slept with a stripper

178
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:25,089
in Kansas City.

179
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:26,489
Cause that's a phone call
no man wants.

180
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:29,199
<i>"Guess who's gonna be joining
us for breakfast? Cinnamon Junior."</i>

181
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:32,399
<i>"Not if my seven hundred dollars
has anything to say about it.</i>

182
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,999
<i>Now clean it out."</i>

183
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:39,100
I know. But he had
a really bad dad.

184
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,100
I'm reading the crowd.

185
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,100
One more abortion joke?
You got it.

186
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:51,550
All right. I could tell. I could tell.
I do this for a living.

187
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,560
Have you heard about this
morning after pill

188
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,480
or as I like to call it
breakfast in bed?

189
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,670
That a few women have taken
and died a few days later?

190
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,630
Ho, talk about two birds.

191
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,709
Oh, yeah.

192
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,690
<i>"Looks like I will be going to
the game this weekend, fellas.</i>

193
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,690
<i>Drinks are on me.
I had a great week."</i>

193
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:22,690
Poker's a sport?
Then put it in the Olympics.

194
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,480
And you can only play with
what your country's worth.

195
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,000
How great would that be,
being American?

196
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,880
<i>"Looks like Costa Rica's all
in with 15 coconuts."</i>

197
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:37,120
<i>"We're gonna to call. Hasta luego,
small blind. Shouldn't have limped.</i>

198
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,060
<i>Go cry about your bad beat to
Nicaragua. They got guns.</i>

199
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,160
Do you guys even get what my
show's about? Huh?

200
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,850
Do you? I'm talking about
bringing the troops home.

201
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,500
That's the message. It's not obvious,
but it's there.

202
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,579
Bring the troops home tomorrow and
continue the war here!

203
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:07,000
Because we owe it to our troops to
let them sleep in their own beds
with their families.

204
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Wake up in the morning have a
delicious breakfast, drive to war.

205
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,849
We can have it in Nebraska.
We don't need that horrible state.

206
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,849
That can be our field.
Some of you are: <i>"Oh, it's not nice!</i>

207
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:23,110
<i>Then we wouldn't have any corn!"</i>
My SUV doesn't run on corn.

208
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,380
Ethanol is a dream and a dumb one.

209
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,520
And let's not pretend that anyone in
here likes Nebraska.

210
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,360
Have you ever wondered why
there's storm chasers?

211
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,850
An hour in Omaha and I'm looking
for a tornado to take me anyplace.

212
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,350
Get me the hell out of there!

213
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:44,610
No wonder they're all fat. It's so
they will stay on the ground.

214
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:48,310
And yes I do that joke in Omaha.

215
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:52,550
And I stare at them while I'm
saying it. And I'm sure they'd love

216
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:57,150
to scream at me, but they can't because
they're too busy eating fried mayonnaise ball.

217
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:04,050
<i>"I'll get to you later, boy. These are
delicious! Server! Another bucket!</i>

218
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:08,699
<i>Quickly! I felt my blood moving!"</i>

219
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,699
Parade or fireworks?
Which do you go to?

220
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:13,799
Fireworks. Of course.

221
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,040
I don't even have a joke for the
moron that yells: <i>"Parade!"</i>

222
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:23,000
<i>"I would go to a parade. I'm here
alone because I make horrible decisions."</i>

223
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,900
You don't even know when a parade's
finished. Do you? Like: <i>"Oh, is that it?</i>

224
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,400
<i>Can we go? I'd like to
wash the gay off me."</i>

225
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,800
And it's sticky.

226
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:41,240
Fireworks. You know when they're
finished. The finale. It's pretty impressive.

227
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,420
Parades could learn a thing
or two. They need a finale.

228
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,000
My recommendation? One more
lap. 60 times the speed.

229
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,020
Bands on a full sprint. Floats going 80.
Midgets falling off cause they have little fingers.

230
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,120
They can't hold on.

231
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,370
Right? So kids are catching them.
<i>"Mom, can we keep him?"</i>

232
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:59,039
<i>"I don't see why not.
They're not real."</i>

233
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:01,939
They're not.
They can't even vote in our country.

234
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:06,349
OK. They can vote, but they've
no clue who they picked.

235
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:08,829
They're jumping up, grabbing levers.

236
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:12,529
And that's the story of how
President Bush won the election.

237
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:19,000
Oh, yes I did. That joke
had a happy ending.

238
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,849
Mmm, I was like a-- Bless you.

239
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:28,580
They say bless you because they used
to believe evil spirit were in your soul.

240
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,750
So whenever I have to sneeze I
encourage my friends to be like:

241
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:35,539
<i>"Get out of him! Get out of him!"</i>

242
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,000
You ever have to sneeze and you can't
sneeze and have the worst feeling?

243
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,908
Do you know what it means? An
angel in heaven faked an orgasm.

244
00:17:45,008 --> 00:17:47,708
It's true. I read that in Revelations.
Or had a messed-up dream.

245
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,260
Either way it was hard
to believe.

246
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:54,000
My jeans faded, your jeans with
holes in them.

247
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,930
Yet they're not this old. That's
how we bought them.

248
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,920
That's ridiculous.

249
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,950
I say give them brand new to the
homeless. Let them age it. Then
take it back, wash it, sell it.

250
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,939
That way we can clothe the homeless,
but we can still look down on them,

251
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,400
because they're not in style.

252
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,660
We need classes. Know your role.

253
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,019
Don't you love that one:
<i>"Money doesn't buy happiness."</i>

254
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:20,899
Do you live in America? Because
it buys a waverunner.

255
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,900
You ever seen a sad person
on a waverunner?

256
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:30,428
Have you? Seriously, have you?
Seriously, have you?

257
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,428
Try to frown on a waverunner.

258
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,530
They're so awesome. It's just throttle.
People smile as they hit the pier.

259
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,590
Because you forget you need gas to turn.
It goes against your natural instincts.

260
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,800
Some of you aren't laughing.
We all miss your cousin.

261
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,800
But not not laughing is not
gonna bring him back.

262
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,800
I don't think that's right.
He's dead for a reason.

263
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,800
He's was a show-off
and he tried to spray us.

264
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,200
<i>"I didn't wanna to get wet!"</i> I
yelled at his mother at the funeral.

265
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:20,000
Do you like how I start jokes
with mass appeal and continue

266
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,600
till only six people have a
clue what I'm talking about?

267
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,000
That's not a good style. That
doesn't make you famous.

268
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,879
Of course money buys happiness.
Ever seen a homeless person skip?

269
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,460
The answer to that riddle's: no.

270
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,500
They're not allowed. I once saw
a homeless person start to skip,

271
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,750
bottle him right in the dome.

272
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,410
He forgot the rules.
He'll remember next time.

273
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,570
Yeah, I threw it.

274
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:49,750
I don't care. Why is he happier
than me? He shouldn't be, I'm rich.

275
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Spiritually.

276
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,000
You ever hear a girl say that?
<i>"I'm not religious, but I'm spiritual."</i>

277
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,040
I reply: <i>"I'm not honest, but
you're really interesting.</i>

278
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,040
<i>Let's have cider and talk
about your crazy cats.</i>

279
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,330
<i>Maybe three hours from now
I can dry hump you.</i>

280
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:14,350
<i>No? Okay, then scattergories."</i>
That's second base in Christian baseball.

281
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,719
Some loose girls play as a singles.
Slow down ladies!

282
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,250
I'm all for women that decided to
get plastic surgery, because plastic

283
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:25,300
surgery allows you the rare opportunity
to make your outer apperance reflect
your inner apperance.

284
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:30,220
Fake. Which is a positive joke for
women unless of course you have

285
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:33,520
fake boobs. Let's be honest you're
not bright enough to get that joke.

286
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,419
How's that feel, whores?

287
00:20:37,419 --> 00:20:41,219
Yeah, just keep telling yourself you
did it so your shirts would fit better.

288
00:20:41,219 --> 00:20:44,079
You did it because
you're a whore.

289
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:49,210
You forgot because you're stupid.
Enjoy your free drinks.

290
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:53,000
I'll buy. I love big titties!

291
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,550
Yeah! You got big titties
then top-shelf.

292
00:20:56,550 --> 00:21:00,010
Small titties?
Beer in a can.

293
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,710
You ever been to a third world
country? Not a boob job in the

294
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,770
bunch, yet they still find happiness.
And that's discouraging

295
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,980
because they're
tough to look at.

296
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,150
No, no, I know you have a harelip,
but why not work on that rack first?

297
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:18,500
I'm from America, I don't speak
your <i>booga-booga</i> language.

298
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,500
By the way, I hate soccer.

299
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,309
And we wonder why other
countries think we're a trainwreck,

300
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:28,230
when we have shows like
<i>"The Swan Extreme Makeover".</i>

301
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:31,230
<i>"I don't wanna develop a personality
you're better off cutting my face."</i>

302
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:39,139
<i>"Am I happy? Am I-- This is the
expression I ordered. Happy."</i>

303
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:42,929
Put me on Extreme Makeover.
I'd like a vagina under my arm.

304
00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:45,750
Yeah, that's extreme.

305
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,320
I don't even know if they can do this
surgery. Whatever. I signed the waiver.

306
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,770
Let's go, doc! Drill!

307
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:57,270
You know how I like it.
516 and juicy like a starburst.

308
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,300
This joke get's worse.
Hang in there. Alright?

309
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,580
My friends be: <i>"You look different."</i>
I'll be: <i>"Uh huh."</i>

310
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:08,540
<i>"Oh man! Are you ticklish?
Are you?"</i>

311
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,310
<i>"All right, come on, guys!
Two fingers. There you go.</i>

312
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:14,130
<i>Oh, yeah. That feels so good.</i>

313
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:18,530
<i>Now I know why I call
you best friend forever."</i>

314
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,920
I think it's pretty obvious that I don't
pander in my act. But just in case there's

315
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,920
any women in here that have had plastic
surgery or considering getting plastic

316
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,220
surgery know that I'm just making light
of a social issue. I don't give a shit

317
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,580
either way at all. Please save your
breath. Don't come to me after show

318
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,580
make: <i>"I've got fake boobs
and I'm not stupid."</i>

319
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,700
That's the only thing I've come up with
to make that moment equally
uncomfortable for you.

320
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,700
I know you're not stupid.
I'm telling jokes.

321
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,319
I've had plastic surgery. I could
care less who knows.

322
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,719
I have. How old do you think I am?

323
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,450
Mm? I'm 59.

324
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:05,400
I am. Check my myspace page.
You can't lie on there.

325
00:23:06,429 --> 00:23:08,220
I'm 59.

326
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,220
My lips are not this voluptuous.

327
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,220
I don't know if you're
familiar with the procedure,

328
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,479
but they will take some from your
back section inject it into your lips.

329
00:23:18,479 --> 00:23:22,040
What?
I don't have a lot back there.

330
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,340
So I was forced to
use my dick fat.

331
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:28,580
Because, I've always been told I
have a fat dick.

332
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:32,580
That's why I wear black condoms.
Because, they're slimming.

333
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,560
That's a joke.
I don't wear condoms.

334
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:40,869
I don't. I don't.
It's against my religion.

335
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:45,379
I'm kind of mad that you asked.

336
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,469
Do you know how hard it is
to grow up when you're a little

337
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:50,679
bit different than all the other kids?
Every day in school I would hear it:

338
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,830
<i>"There goes Daniel. He's
got a fat fat dick!"</i>

339
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:01,510
And I would run home crying:
<i>"Mother, why is my dick so fat?"</i>

340
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:05,110
And she'd like: <i>"Because, your
real father's Samoan."</i>

341
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,580
<i>"Is that why I
hate The Rock?"</i>

342
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:13,519
And she said yes and then we
watched <i>"The Rundown"</i> and we wept.

343
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,530
And yes chronologically this
joke makes no sense at all.

344
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:21,750
But I don't know any older
Samoans so The Rock is my dad.

345
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:28,720
Whoa! That joke was loooong.

346
00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:35,780
Oh, yeah. Guess who has cat-like
reflexes? Me. Thank you.

347
00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:41,980
Cat-like reflexes.
Look at this. Watch this.

348
00:24:43,909 --> 00:24:47,500
I can do that every time, ladies.

349
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,500
Am I right?

350
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,500
<i>"I'll put it in."</i>

351
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,800
Alright, let's edit out the me going
like that. My mom would absolutely

352
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,500
So disgusting.
What's wrong with me?

353
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,000
Chapstick. You know what, let
me tell you something. Chapstick.

354
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,500
First of all, if you're a man and you
put your on, you have to put it on

355
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,500
all the way around. You can't just
put on the bottom and go...

356
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:26,689
I mean you can, but then you have to
keep the chapstick in your asshole.

357
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:33,000
Which isn't a bad idea because
I'm always losing my chapstick.

358
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:39,000
My favorite part of the day is when
my upper lip gets dry enough that
I can tuck it in and it stays.

359
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,129
I'm always like:
<i>"Yay! It's this time!"</i>

360
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:45,929
Because, it reminds me of how
shallow I really am.

361
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:48,500
Because I could meet the most
beautiful woman in the world,

362
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,630
but if her lip was like that I'd be:
<i>"Ho-ho! No way!</i>

363
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:54,300
<i>Seriously, somebody get me a
stick. I'm gonna beat this mutant."</i>

364
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:00,700
Okay, here's a joke that's not gonna
work, but I have to do it.

365
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:05,500
Why? Because there are people out
there that will find this funny and I'm

366
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,800
not so selfish that I don't care about
them as well.

367
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,800
I'm sick of the media making female
sport athletes into supermodels

368
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,320
when they're clearly sixes at best.

369
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:23,080
I don't need to be told how
hot Danica Patrick is.

370
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,760
Do you really think she's beautiful?

371
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,150
Danica? She's 4'11 and bowlegged.
You ever watched her walk to her car?

372
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,000
There's nothing hot about her.

373
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,500
Maybe it's sexy when her
hair is blowing in the wind
as she's in last place.

374
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,470
Or Maria Sharapova.
<i>"She's breathtaking!"</i>

375
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:49,900
Really? When she was 13 and
grunting I was into it, but now it
doesn't do much for me.

376
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,900
It's like the Olsen twins.
It's just gotten sad.

377
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,440
I kind of hope one of them ODs
so I can stop guessing.

378
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:06,800
Applause break on a joke I've never
said before on my special.

379
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,000
That's rare. I'm just saying.

380
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,520
I'm not tooting my own horn.
I've never said that in my life.

381
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,100
Fucking improving up here.
God. It's unbelievable.

382
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:23,100
I can kegel 75 pounds.
Is that a lot? Is that good?

383
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,180
I don't know. I'm told it's good.

384
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,790
Three sets of 40.

385
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,390
Is there any men in here that have
a ponytail right now?

386
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,200
I swear to God I want
to see some of it.

387
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Do you have a ponytail?
No, you don't.

388
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,500
Oh, you were just trying to help me?
Like, like--

389
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,200
I hate him.

390
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,200
A man with a ponytail is saying:
<i>"Hey! Don't fuck with me."</i>

391
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,300
While a man with pigtails is saying:
<i>"Here. Hold these while you fuck me."</i>

392
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,460
It's a subtle difference,
but it speaks volumes.

393
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,260
It's all about that part.

394
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:11,090
You think there's any case of polite
Tourette's in the world?

395
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:14,040
Like one random person yells
out random compliments for
no reason all.

396
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,840
<i>"Lovely smile!</i>

397
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,560
<i>Sorry, I have a disease."</i>
You'd be: <i>"Don't worry about it.
That was nice."</i>

398
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,560
<i>"Lovely hat!"</i>

399
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,440
I think two examples is enough.
Next joke.

400
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,290
How does Superman fly faster? Can
anyone answer me this? How did Supe--

401
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:38,590
I get that he can fly. I accept that.
I just wanna know how he flies faster.

402
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,290
Is it just like more...

403
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:47,289
It's the only part I don't understand.
Does he have different settings like:

404
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:51,000
<i>"Oh, this is my cruising speed
I can one-arm-it with a bitch. You
know, take her around town."</i>

405
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:56,700
I just need some nerd to talk
to me after a show:

406
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,120
<i>"See, what happened when
the planet exploded..."</i>

407
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:02,820
And I'll tell you
what a vagina feels like.

408
00:29:07,129 --> 00:29:08,820
Are we even?

409
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,139
You know there's actually a blood
test out now where you can find

410
00:29:13,139 --> 00:29:14,779
out if your kid is gay or not?

411
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:17,779
Yeah, it's an HIV test.

412
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,590
I know. Ok, I know.

413
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,639
It's not a great joke, I know, but
it's a hundred percent accurate.

414
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I hope we find a cure for every major
disease, because I'm tired of walking 5k.

415
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,520
I'm pretty sure I don't have to
sweat for cancer. I'll write a check.

416
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:49,260
I have high-definition television
because I felt the lack of resolution

417
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,260
was affecting my ability to
solve cases on CSI.

418
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,689
I need some more clarity in this house.
Have this case wrapped up in a half an

419
00:29:56,690 --> 00:30:01,149
hour. That way I don't have to listen to
Gil Grissom ramble on about bugs.

420
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:04,549
We get it. You like maggots.
You're weird.

421
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:09,410
I just burped.
Did you guys hear that?

421
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,410
It's weird I'm actually mad
because earlier today

422
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:16,000
I had a black and chicken wrap and
they forgot the ranch and when I burped

422
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,400
I was like <i>"You know what? I'm mad
again that there was no ranch on it."</i>

423
00:30:21,499 --> 00:30:24,799
Like that burp would have been
better had there been ranch.

424
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:33,470
Did anybody see the Oprah Winfrey
episode where she had a little girl in there

425
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:36,919
born with a rare disease where
she didn't feel pain? Like she put her hand

426
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:38,690
on the stove she knows it's hot
she'd leave it there.

427
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:41,179
It was a nightmare for the parents.
They had to check on their child constantly

428
00:30:41,179 --> 00:30:45,890
to make sure she wasn't hurt, because she
would never cry. And I got so sad because at

429
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:50,840
that moment I realized I can never have
kids. If that was my kid I would've been like:

430
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:57,399
<i>"Honey! We have to talk! Our
kid is a fucking superhero!

431
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:05,260
<i>Yes! I got her in the UFC fight this
weekend. I don't know. I think she's

432
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:08,260
<i>gonna do great. I snapped her
arm six hours ago. She didn't tap out!

433
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:15,410
<i>I love her! She will be
the next Royce Gracie!"

433
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,640
I love that Kobe Bryant puts out
a commercial this year:

435
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,500
<i>"Hate me because I'm a champion.
Hate me because of my work ethic."

436
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,720
It's like we hate you because you
were accused of rape.

437
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:35,260
What planet does he live in where he's
like: <i>"Seriously guys, why are they pissed off?

438
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,200
<i>Because of the rape?

439
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:42,520
<i>Are you sure?
That doesn't add up."

440
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,840
I love basketball and I love college
basketball and I'm happy that the NBA

441
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,010
finally made a rule change. Forcing
high school athletes to play at least

442
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,340
one year of college ball.

443
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:58,100
It's a great rule change for college
basketball. I came up with one more.

444
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,170
Just for college.

445
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:02,170
Why not let white players
get one more point?

446
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,530
Right? Who cares? Not gonna affect the
games at all. Gonna make them feel

447
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:13,129
like they're contributing. A valuable
lesson to learn in college and to remind

448
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:16,600
the black athletes that no matter how
hard they try in this country, they'll always

449
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,900
make less than
their white counterpart.

449
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:26,900
Laughter is the right response. White
people going <i>"Oooh"</i> is ridiculous.

450
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
You reap the benefits, you just
don't like it thrown in your face.

451
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:35,380
<i>"I hate making more
money for no reason!"

452
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:43,590
<i>Secretly, I love it. I just wanted the
black people here to see me go "Oooh!"

452
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:46,110
<i>So they be: "Oh, that most be one
of the good white people."

453
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:49,000
But, you're not. That's why they're
gonna shoot you after the show.

454
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:59,950
Oh, how's that feel, you cracker? My
fo-fo makes all your kids don't grow.

455
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:03,420
Miss you, 2Pac.

456
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,630
I love when people act like they don't
understand why the rest of the world may

457
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:09,870
hate our country. We have a game
show in our country called Survivor.

458
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:16,379
That's a game in our country. Where you
can win a million dollars for surviving

459
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,380
30 days in a place where
people already live.

460
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:25,220
Do you realize what kind of message that
sends? <i>"I've been here for 60 years.

461
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:30,600
<i>May I have some bread?"
"No. We're Americans. This is a game.

462
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,659
<i>We don't have our cell phones.
This is really hard.

463
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,600
<i>I don't even get service here anyway.
I'm a Cingular. They merged with AT&T.

464
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,300
<i>I'm suppose to have
double the bars. I have no bars.

464
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,959
<i>And I hate this island
of Wahapui.

465
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,300
<i>Which I thought was a shampoo
by Paul Mitchell. It's not. 

466
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:50,250
<i>That's Awapuhi.
And it smells good."

467
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,669
You can't celebrate in football anymore.
That's a rule change. Are you kidding me?

468
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:59,450
If I score a touchdown, which is unlikely
because I went undrafted yet again.

469
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,500
Despite a solid 40 and great hands.

470
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:08,000
I will celebrate. And I'm not gonna
point to the heavens either,

471
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I'm gonna go like this.

472
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,810
Because God is everywhere.

473
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:25,500
He is. He's in my soul. He can be
in yours you have to invite him.

474
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:30,000
He's like a vampire.
The dude's got rules.

474
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,159
<i>"Stop celebrating
and just do your job."

475
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:38,000
Their job's to catch a ball. I don't care
if you get in the endzone and have

476
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,300
a 10-minute tea party. It's a game.

476
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,200
Just don't get mad at me when you're
paralyzed from the neck down,

476
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,000
being carted off the field cause some
free safety took your head off.

477
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,589
And you see me in the stand going:
<i>"Ho-ho! Dance now, you overpaid clown!

478
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:53,969
<i>How does it feel to
know God hates you?

479
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:57,890
<i>Maybe V8 will sponsor a vegetable!"

480
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,580
Yeah, moan all you want. I love defense.
DE-FENSE!

480
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,580
That's what chant I start in my section.
Usually 118, lower bowl.

481
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,000
You see me at a football game, I
got a big letter D. I'm going: <i>"D!"

481
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,400
My friend Carl he's got a fence.
Chain-link not white picket.
We're not faggots.

482
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,020
One of us is.

483
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,380
It's gross.

483
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:37,080
Butt sex is a lot like spinach. If
you're forced to have it as a child,

484
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,200
you won't enjoy it as an adult.

484
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,100
Am I right?

485
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:50,290
Saw a guy wearing a What Would Jesus Do?
bracelet and a Lance Armstrong bracelet

485
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:53,690
and he went up to this blind kid and
rubbed his eyes. And the kid could see.

486
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:57,300
And he wasn't used to the light and it was bright
and he walked into traffic and was killed instantly.

487
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,890
OK, people that are laughing
I'm gonna call you half-full.

488
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:09,328
Because you're focusing on the important
part of the story. The bracelets <i>are</i> working.

489
00:36:14,529 --> 00:36:18,130
I took my What Would Jesus Do?
bracelet and put it on my Jewish
friend's wrist, it burned his skin.

490
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:21,660
He threw it on the ground, it turned
into a serpent. We both started laughing.

491
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,930
We left it there. We hate snakes.

492
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:27,930
We think they're slimy. Even
though we know they're not.

493
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,820
Do you get the joke? I'm making fun of
people take the bracelets too literally.

494
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:38,420
They're not magical. They're a reminder
to be a better person, to live a better life.

495
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,570
And if you need a rubber band around
your wrist to be that, here's an idea.

496
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:48,240
Take it off and snap yourself in the eye
and see if that wakes you.

497
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,390
I wore What Would Jesus Do? bracelet. In
a movie theater once to see if it worked.

498
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:55,700
A cell phone went off. One of those
obnoxious rings where it's a song.

499
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:59,000
And he didn't want to answer
because the good part's coming.

499
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,490
Then he answers the phone
in the theater.

500
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:05,180
<i>"What's going on? No, I'm in the movies."</i>
This is what I said verbatim

501
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,100
and I'm not going to censor myself:

502
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:12,279
<i>"Hey, buddy. Get off the phone, please."</i>

502
00:37:12,279 --> 00:37:13,279
This is what he says to me:

503
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,410
<i>"Shut up and mind your
own business, asshole."

504
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:18,990
Ha! Now, there's trouble
in River City.

505
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:22,790
I'm a man.
Not much of one, but a man.

505
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:27,190
I will choke you if you're younger,
smaller and preferably white.

506
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:31,280
I had my hands on his neck
and then I saw my bracelet

507
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,840
staring right back at me.

508
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:39,390
What Would Jesus Do? So I lit him
on fire and sent him to hell.

508
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,990
I did. I had to.

508 
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,000
Amen.

508 
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,710
I waste so much time in my life.
I could've acomplished so much more,

509
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,780
but I have no dreams.
Like real dreams.

509
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,780
I sit at home thinking about: <i>"How
come nobody with a Lamborghini

509
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,000
<i>ever pulls up next to me:
'Hey, man. You want this car?'

510
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:05,999
<i>I'm like: 'Fuck yeah! I do!
Yes! I got a Lamborghini today!'"

510
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,799
This never happen.
Think that's wasted energy.

511
00:38:12,899 --> 00:38:15,369
I want to get rich enough in life
that I can afford to

511
00:38:15,369 --> 00:38:18,369
release a dozen doves every time
I walk into a room.

512
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:26,800
You know people would be: <i>"Did you
see that guy come out of the bathroom?

513
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:33,640
<i>The one with doves. It was beautiful.
I bet that's John Woo's kid."

514
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:43,380
Oh, balcony appreciating a Woo reference.
Front row guy's going: <i>"Yes."</i>

515
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,129
The rest of you google it. I don't care.

516
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:51,109
Hate you, Google. You've caused a lot of
problems in my relationship. I shared a
 
517
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:54,00
computer with my girlfriend. She'd look up
anything. <i>"I'm gonna look up apples today."

518
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,000
She sets to "A". Asian ass porn instantly!
Google's like: <i>"I'll take it from here.

519
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:05,960
<i>I know exactly what you're looking up.
Every time you hit A it's Asian ass porn!"</i>

520
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:11,210
Google, all I ask is you let her
type three letters before you jump to

521
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:16,200
such a bold conclusion. It's bad enough
I'm clearing my history every three

522
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,800
hours and changing my passwords.
I'm trying to have an honest relationship

523
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:26,500
and you're fucking my shit up.
And guess what?

524
00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:29,660
When I'm looking up asian ass porn, guess
who has all the time in the world?

525
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:34,430
Oh, I do. I've got the house locked. The
plantation shutters are closed.

526
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:38,419
My keyboard is in a safe
but reachable distance.

526
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,100
Do you appreciate the picture
I am painting?

527
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:48,799
I am jerking it in this joke!
This is highbrow stuff, guys.

527
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,799
I'm gonna be so famous.

527
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,420
I shave all my pubes.

528
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:01,090
I don't know why I looked
at you when I said that.

529
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:04,759
But I thought you
would appreciate it.

530
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,900
Why? Because I'd like to have
the fastest sex ever.

531
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:13,160
That's why. I got three and a half
seconds off my best time.

532
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,950
Congratulations, little Phelps.

532
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,950
Check off swimming joke.
Got one!

533
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,790
I wrote that joke because my
friend's a swimmer.

533
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,790
He's like:
<i>"Why do you shave all your pubes?"

534
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:28,750
I'm like:
<i>"Why are you in my bathroom?"

534
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,700
<i>"Cause, I enjoy watching you poop."</i>

535
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,570
And I'm like: <i>"Okay no more slumber
parties. That's creepy."

536
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:37,250
And sure I do it adorable. Both elbows and
knees, fingers crossed, chin down.

537
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:40,020
That's my business. Close the door!
I got the Bellagio coming out of my ass,

538
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,930
I don't need an audience.

538
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:48,630
Highbrow poop joke. My father said
<i>"Impossible"</i>, I said <i>"Nay".</i>

539
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,850
Top that, Bob Newhart.

539
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:02,050
Do you love goose down feathers?

540
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:05,220
Do you have the trifecta?
Mattress pad, pillows, comforter.

541
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:12,629
Oh, it's like sleeping in heaven. Till
that quill comes through the pillowcase

542
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,490
and sticks you in the eye.

543
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:19,740
And says: <i>"How's that feel bitch? Huh?
You like sleeping on my carcass? Do you?"

544
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:26,139
Goose why do you hurt so good?
Maybe a higher thread count.

545
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:29,190
600 does the trick. Quit sleeping on 12.
That's hay.

545
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,690
Spend the money.
It's 1/3 of your life.

546
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:37,370
Sorry. My nose itched.

547
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:40,370
Hello, Carol Burnett's daughter.

548
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:46,330
I think I'm too young for that reference
and it doesn't warrant an "Awww".

549
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:48,650
When I die, which is gonna
be in four years.

550
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:50,430
Yay!
It's the only thing I can plan.

550
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:56,360
I'm gonna be cremated
from the neck down.

551
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,840
Yeah, then at my funeral when people are
talking about me they have to hold my head.

552
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:04,100
And then at the end they have to kick me
into the audience and the audience has to

553
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:07,550
keep me up for at least 3 hits or else
you have to start the whole service over.

553
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:13,500
And no cradlement. I want legit sets.
Anyone seen Karch?

554
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:21,100
Do you guys daydream about being
on the Price Is Right as much as I do?

554
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,710
Contestants throw the last bid
of the sweet spot.

555
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,760
What are you gonna do?
You're the last bidder.

556
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,100
<i>"One dollar."</i> Does your hoodie sweatshirt say
<i>"I go to the University of I waste my bid"?

556
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,790
Because that's what you just did.

557
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:40,310
That's dumb. The best bid statistically
you have to muster up some courage to go, ok.

558
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:42,560
<i>"I need to know what the
highest bid was.

559
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,650
<i>"7."
"Ok, 7,1."

559
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:47,850
<i>"Ruined your day, didn't I,
lady? Huh?


560
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:52,490
<i>You got an awfully small window.
Hope you nailed it."

561
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:55,500
I don't know why you wanna nail it
anyway. So you can go onstage,

562
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,259
reach into some old guy's pocket
for a hundred-dollar bill?

563
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,520
My grandpa used to do that all the
time. There was no hundred-dollar bill.


564
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,369
There was a whole in his pocket
and no underwear on.

565
00:43:03,369 --> 00:43:06,800
Excuse me. Don't you go <i>"Ooh."</i>
My grandpa was a great man.

566
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,500
If wanted his balls touched by a
little boy he was gonna to get it.

566
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:13,090
He shed blood for your freedoms
and don't you forget it.

566
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,990
I think I'm on the wrong
side of that one, I get it.

567
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:24,109
You ever said the silent prayer when you see
the old lady spinning the wheel hoping once

568
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:27,830
in your lifetime she gets caught underneath
and it snaps her back right in half?

569
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:30,200
And a pool of blood comes around
and lands on a dollar.

570
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,520
Bob starts peeing himself.
He can't hold it. Not at that age.

571
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:38,520
It's dangerous. So he's peeing, laughing.
<i>"Get up bitch! You have a bonus spin!"

572
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,620
Take the bonus spin seriously.

572
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:48,120
What are the greens worth in the
bonus spin? 5,000. That is a lot of coin.

573
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:51,490
It's gonna slow your heart rate down, you
gonna bid more effectively in the showdown.

573
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:55,000
Now you're in the one seat, you gonna
bid or pass? Bid or pass? Pass!

573
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,490
Pass! Of course. It's rookie!

574
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:02,000
The first showdown? Carpet, couch, the net set.
I'm not on the Queer Price Is Right, am I?

575
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,110
I signed up the straight one, yeah.
I'm gonna send that South. I'd like the

576
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:10,890
second showdown. That one has a waverunner
and a camper. It's a white-trash starter kit.

577
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:16,900
I know, I know. A lot of you're like:
<i>"We don't even have a trailer hitch."

578
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,980
Screw you.
You're camping in your driveway.

579
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:22,570
Maybe you can buy an inflatable
pool so your kid can drown.

579
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:25,070
Or maybe you can spend more
than a hundred dollars on a pool.

580
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:27,730
You're a horrible parent and
I'm glad your grass died.

581
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:32,030
Are we down to six people?
Perfect. Okay.

582
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:35,569
<i>"Well, I don't get the last part.
I mean, obviously the last, but what?

583
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:37,170
<i>The grass died?
What does that mean?"

584
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:39,740
<i>"Well, if you leave the pool out for a day
or so it kills your lawn."

585
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:43,899
<i>"I rent an apartment."
"That joke's clearly not for you. 

586
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:49,300
<i>Maybe if you're nice I'll do
a poorer version later."

587
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:54,760
I won't.
I will not.

588
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,000
I heart President Bush.

588
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:02,890
President Bush has done some
great things. I don't know if

589
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:07,870
you're aware of this but '07, extending
daylight savings time two months longer.

590
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:10,600
Yeah, I'm aboard. Thank you.

590
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:13,800
That's great. Do you not know this?
Next year it's two months longer.

591
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,810
It's not new months like
Recktober and Toyotathon.

592
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:22,210
Which I'm sure he tried.
<i>"What are you talking about?"

593
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:28,900
<i>"Nevermind. I'm gonna go to the
ranch. I'll see in seven weeks.
That storm cut my last one short."

595
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:33,430
Okay, first of all day light savings time
was created for farmers and there's only

596
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:37,500
four of them left, so I don't think
they warrant half the calendar year.

597
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:41,600
I say keep it 50/50 but instead of
one hour forward, ready? Ready?

597
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:46,630
Five hours forward! Suck it!

598
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:49,960
By the way if you ever have a job where you
have to give speeches in front of people

599
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:53,200
pepper in the phrase <i>"Suck it!"</i>
Very empowered.

600
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:58,000
Just be: <i>"As you can see from our
powerpoint presentation suck it..."

601
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:03,430
And your clients be: <i>"Did he--
did he say suck it?

601
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:07,790
<i>I like this guy.
He's a go-getter."

602
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:12,890
Okay, I say change from 1 to 5 hours
forward because people with 9-to-5 jobs

603
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:16,760
you've gotten so selfish and complacent
with the daylight. You get it all the time.

604
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,150
People that work at night, a third
of this country according to a survey

605
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:23,660
I made up for this joke,
we get robbed.

606
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:27,940
It's not fair. Half year. 5 hours forward.
Means the sun's rising at noon.

607
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:32,560
Means I don't feel like such a piece
of shit every morning when I'm waking up.

608
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:37,500
I'm like: <i>"Wow, the sun's just now
coming up? I'm might mail a letter
and get groceries today.

609
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,780
<i>Time for me to turn
his life around.

610
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:46,260
<i>Starting tomorrow. Because today
there's a Laguna Beach marathon on MTV.

611
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:48,300
<i>And I'm gonna get caught up
on season 3.


612
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:52,200
<i>Try to figure out why they're
so fucking ugly this year."

613
00:46:56,869 --> 00:47:02,880
And that joke's not even over!
Are you kidding me?

614
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,880
And sexually transmitted diseases
would drop off completely!

615
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:11,749
Oh, I'll feed you, baby birds.

616
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:18,000
Do you think I'd leave you with a
cliffhanger? That's not my style.

616
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,200
5 hours forward, think about it. That
means the sun's setting at 2 in the morning.

617
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,800
Means, guys you are at a bar,
pumping drinks into some girl.

618
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,460
You get to bring her outside
in the daylight.

619
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:34,190
Yeah, you'd be like: <i>"Noo! I
had a lovely time this evening,

620
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:38,280
<i>but I will see your ass back
in standard time where you belong."</i>

620
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,280
And she's like: <i>"Oh, he'll be back.

621
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,280
<i>They always come back for
my coochie in the dark."

622
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:54,700
And you will be like: <i>"Thank you,
Daniel and your new daylight savings time.

623
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:59,500
<i>You kept me from having sex with a
pterodactyl."

624
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:05,710
And you don't want to sleep with
a pterodactyl. Not at your place. They
have a 14 foot wingspan minimum.

625
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:08,120
They're knocking everything off
your counters.

626
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:15,500
Then you have to go to Target, you're
on a budget. That place gets expensive.

626
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,750
You go in there for two things,
but then you see the frames.

627
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:21,020
Who can pass up brushed silver?

628
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:24,970
<i>"I say we change all our socket
covers, not just the bathroom."

628
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:28,570
Ah, you see that guy? One guy!
That's why I just kept going

629
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:33,310
till one person was like:
<i>"Holy shit! That joke had everything!

630
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:36,370
<i>Oh, my goodness!

631
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:40,810
<i>Do you mind if I recap? There was sex,
there was pterodactyls, the knickknacks

632
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:44,110
<i>at target. I was just telling you
we should change our socket covers.

633
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:46,600
<i>This guy's more of a prophet
less of a comedian."

634
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:50,250
You're welcome.
You are welcome, sir.

634
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,250
I think we should legalize
marijuana in this country.

635
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:00,860
Just so potheads have nothing
to talk about ever again.

636
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:04,349
Come on! It does get a little annoying
after awhile.

636
00:49:04,349 --> 00:49:06,349
Just the: <i>"Hey, you want to get high?
- "No." - "Why not?"

637
00:49:06,349 --> 00:49:10,500
<i>"Because I'm not in the
seventh grade and I have things to do.

638
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,549
<i>Why don't you grow up and do
coke like an adult?"

639
00:49:13,149 --> 00:49:17,700
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about!
Let's get some meth!

640
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,990
No? Alright. Sorry.
I went too far.

641
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:23,999
Oh, nothing like tweaking for 3 days.
Am I right?

642
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:29,140
I love flip-flops.

642
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:32,000
Do you?
Women it's ok love them.

643
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,750
Men? It's 50/50 right? Because, you've been
stuck, you've been caught,

644
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:37,930
you've been at the airport
urinal in your flip-flops.

645
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:39,900
Ha! Not the best time.

645
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,700
You're standing there, your feet get
a little wet, you haven't started yet.

646
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:49,750
Now there's a problem. You got two
choices. You can 1 ignore it live that

647
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:52,400
"Kite Runner" shame as long as
you can bottle it.

648
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,660
Or you can 2 face your
attacker, whisper in his ear:

648
00:49:55,660 --> 00:50:02,209
<i>"Thank you. That's what I like before
a flight to Phoenix. Get me ready for the heat."

650
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:09,349
That is a golden shower and "Kite Runner"
reference in the same joke. Almost

651
00:50:09,349 --> 00:50:14,860
impossible. Almost impossible.
I pull it off because I care.

652
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:20,330
Alright. I'm pro-gay marriage. Just the
idea of having a man around the house.

653
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:22,960
Finally I get some stuff done.

654
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,960
<i>"Let's go!
We got chores this weekend!"

655
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:32,430
<i>"God hates queers!"

656
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:38,310
That's me pretending to be a
right-wing redneck radical protesting.

657
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:42,470
Not double-fisting a black cock.

657
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:45,870
You have to have the right visual
or this joke's gonna hold no weight.

658
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:49,529
<i>"Oh, he's picketing!
Okay, that makes sense."

659
00:50:55,259 --> 00:50:57,738
<i>"That didn't look like picketing.
That last part didn't look like that."

660
00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:03,250
<i>"God made Adam and Eve,
not Adam and Steve!"

660
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:04,750
Do you wanna know the answer
between a religion and gays?

661
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:07,680
Look in the Bible. Look at Adam
and Eve in the Garden of Eden.

662
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:13,320
We all know who sinned first. Come
on ladies. Do you have to eat everything?

663
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,539
No, I know. You were hungry. There was
a snake talking to you. Stick to that story.

664
00:51:16,539 --> 00:51:22,000
That's scary. If a snake told me:
<i>"Eat an apple."</i> I'd be: <i>"Alright.
I didn't know you could talk!</i>

665
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,549
Oh, man. I hope it's a Granny Smith.
I like those. Those are sour. If it's a
Golden Delicious I'm like:

666
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:30,180
<i>"Leave me alone, snake! I'm eating
peaches. You talk to me in 2 months

667
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:32,750
<i>when Fuji apples are ready."

667
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:38,810
And chronologically
that joke is accurate.

668
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:41,828
I know a lot about apples.

669
00:51:41,829 --> 00:51:47,390
Now we have to be punished for all
mankind? Because of you women
eating an apple?

670
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:52,660
What was women's punishment?
Do you even know?
Painful childbirth, menstrual cycles.

671
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:55,769
Man's punishment?
We have to deal with women.

672
00:51:55,999 --> 00:51:58,068
That's why I get so upset with:
<i>"God hates gays!" 

673
00:51:58,068 --> 00:52:03,500
God doesn't hate gay people, he's just
upset because they found a loophole
in the system.

674
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:06,490
Wouldn't that upset you if you came
up with a great punishment and they're:

674
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:09,309
<i>"We are just gonna sleep with each other."

675
00:52:09,309 --> 00:52:15,519
Yeah, it's a lot easier than listening
to that: <i>"Listen, listen, listen, listen,

676
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:23,859
<i>listen, listen, listen, if I lost a
leg would you still love me?"

677
00:52:23,859 --> 00:52:27,489
<i>"What? No! A leg?

678
00:52:27,489 --> 00:52:33,219
<i>Are you kidding me? That's a bold
move to test our love with a limb.

679
00:52:33,219 --> 00:52:37,559
<i>You could've started with a fingernail,
found out real quick I'm shallow.

680
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:41,890
<i>You lose a leg, I saw a guy
on the freeway you'd be perfect for.

680
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:44,610
Matchmaker!

681
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:48,450
Honestly, girls. If there's any woman
in here that ends up dating me

682
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:49,470
and you lose your leg.

683
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:52,500
God forbid, I hope it doesn't happen.
But if you do and we're dating,

684
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:58,000
the only thing you can be sure of
is: I will push you over.

684
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,000
All right. I will push over and be
like: <i>"You aint' no Weeble Wobble!"

684
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,000
<i>"You aint' no Weeble Wobble!"

685
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:16,010
My job is so good. That whole joke,
that whole stupid long joke is just

686
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:20,129
to get to a point where I can yell:
<i>"You ain't no Weeble Wobble!"

686
00:53:25,129 --> 00:53:29,129
I always think it's funny when guys
find out that somebody is pregnant.

687
00:53:29,129 --> 00:53:32,700
And you're a guy and you're always
talking and arguing: <i>"Hey!

687
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:36,430
<i>Bet you hope it's a boy! Ha?
You want a boy? Right? You want a boy?"

689
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:40,469
This is cheesy to say this, but in my
heart, honestly, I just hope it's black.

690
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:45,899
<i>"Thank God! I'm out of here!
That was close.

691
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:50,430
<i>Sorry you have to give up on your
dreams. I'm gonna go back to being selfish."

692
00:53:52,550 --> 00:53:54,870
Everybody get the joke? It's not my kid.
Because I'm white.

693
00:53:57,490 --> 00:53:59,539
I know! Oh.

693
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:06,339
You guys waited. <i>"Is he white?
Oh, he is white!"

693
00:54:06,339 --> 00:54:09,339
That joke is safe after all.

694
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:12,100
You ever notice when people talk about
where they live is a good place to raise kids

695
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:15,900
what they're trying to say is:
<i>"Where I live is really segregated."

696
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:21,900
Little too close to home for you
Orange County? Got it. Got it.

696
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:26,109
You definetly win that round.

697
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:28,960
I didn't have a privileged childhood
like a lot of you. I grew up on a public

698
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,610
golf course and that's embarrassing.

699
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:35,390
I lived on the right side of the fairway.
All these hacks slicing into my yard.

700
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:39,770
You don't hear a four when you're mowing.
Nothing runs like a Deere, till there's

701
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:42,560
a Titleist lodged in your carburetor.

701
00:54:42,999 --> 00:54:47,560
Public golf course.
Way to aim for the middle, dad!

703
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:54,480
Thank you. That joke actually hurts
to say, but I can do it.

704
00:54:55,500 --> 00:55:01,300
I think this country is ready for another
Civil War. Because these NASCAR
fans are out of control.

705
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:06,440
Oh, there's the line. I've drawn it.
Pick your side. Let's do battle.

706
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:12,050
I hate NASCAR and I hate hunting.
Let's combine them.

707
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:15,660
Every year at Daytona 500 we release
thousands of deer on the infield.

707
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,660
Let him roam wherever they want.

708
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:21,200
No restrictor plates at this race. I want
top speed. 215 plus. They're hitting

709
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,379
deer. They're exploding. People in the
front row they're treating it like a Gallagher

710
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:28,220
show with plastic, you know. As guts come
flying over the wall. Some lucky

711
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:31,939
toothless broad jumps up: <i>"I got antlers
from Jr. This is the best day of my life!

712
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:35,900
<i>Y'all wanna see my titties?"</i>
What? No.

713
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,750
Ok. Now if we can just incorporate spousal
abuse it will be like a redneck triathlon.

714
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:49,000
By the way, everything I say is wrong.
I get it. I don't-- I'm a complete hypocrite.

715
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,700
I've dated girlss with boob jobs,
breast enlargement.

715
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:54,700
But, she was an A cup.
That's gross. Get it fixed, girl.

716
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:57,140
You're not even real woman.

716
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:59,140
I know. You wanna scream at
me, but you can't.

717
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:01,250
Because your training
bra's too tight. 

718
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:06,500
Now, she didn't go overboard like a lot
of girls do. She got a nice full
double D. Classy.

718
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,400
She had a  5'3 frame. It worked.

718
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,400
She put sqeak toys in there, I
thought that was a wonderful decision.

719
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
She was a clown, so it was a tax
write-off.

720
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,000
She was a sad face clown. I could never
tell if she was really happy.

721
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,960
I'd be in the bedroom for hours:
<i>"Are you there yet, Snickers?

722
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,150
And she'd just be...

722
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:35,150
<i>"Well, could you untie my penis out
of a puddle? It's really starting to hurt."

722
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:37,500
That's how clowns blow you.

723
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,700
I don't know how to do it.
It's an asian method.

723
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:47,000
And by Asia, I'm mean eastern
Russia. None of that Indonesia stuff

724
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
which involves a pinky around
back. I don't like it.

725
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,100
I do like it, but on stage I say i don't.
I'm not an open book.

726
00:56:57,190 --> 00:57:00,490
<i>"Guy had sex with clown.
That's disgusting.

727
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:05,680
<i>I mean it's awesome."</i>
No, it's not, guy who's still high fives.

728
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:12,700
Soon as you take off the wig, the funny
shoes, she's just like any other retarded girl.

729
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,539
I loved her. Supported her. She was
in the Olympics.

729
00:57:14,539 --> 00:57:16,340
The ones you're not
suppose to laugh at.

730
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:19,360
But when you watch the hurdles,
they knock over every single one.

731
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,940
You start to giggle. Now you're going
to hell. That's not fair.

732
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:27,040
They're supposed to be athletes. Reube
in lane 6 is chewing on the second hurdle.

733
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,110
Sorry, I found that funny.

734
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:32,290
I'll tell you what's not funny. They sell
those foam hands "You're number 1"

735
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:34,300
except they're shaped like that.

735
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:37,300
How does that build character?

736
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:40,780
Thank you.

737
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:43,780
People that are laughing with your
hand away from your mouth.

738
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:50,180
That joke is clearly not for everyone.
But I enjoy watching people that don't

739
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:55,000
laugh make the people that do laugh,
feel shitty about themselves.

740
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,359
Because, you're all hypocrites.
Televise the special winter olympics.

741
00:57:58,359 --> 00:58:02,359
You're not gonna watch?
Really?

742
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,410
<i>"Is that guy's standing up in the
bobsled?

743
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:10,490
<i>Oh, yeah. Does he know
the tunnel's coming?

744
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:15,290
<i>Why did he pick today not
to wear the helmet?"

744
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:19,290
<i>"You don't make fun of me.
I'm a handicap."

744
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:23,290
I agree with you balcony. Even though
you sound like half a tard to begin with.

745
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,010
Maybe you shouldn't be the group
spokesperson.

745
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:29,410
You don't. For many reasons.

746
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:33,230
First of all they have the strength of 10 men.
Which is equivalent to one chimpanzee.

747
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:37,730
That's why if you ever see retarded
chimpanzee you turn and run.

748
00:58:38,269 --> 00:58:44,328
Okay? Because, that thing is a borderline
superhero. But, Hollywood on their moral

749
00:58:44,329 --> 00:58:47,500
high horse, they won't make
movies about a retarded chimp.

750
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:52,000
Unless of course you
count a Vin Diesel movie.

750
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,900
Which I do. Which I do.

750
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:58,000
And in all fairness to me, if you're
a Vin Diesel fan, you shouldn't be
here watching me, anyway.

751
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,300
You should be at home coloring, praying
your next one gets on the refrigerator.

752
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:04,390
But it won't, because elephants
aren't orange, you idiot.

753
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:08,529
Thanks a lot you guys.
Have a good night.
