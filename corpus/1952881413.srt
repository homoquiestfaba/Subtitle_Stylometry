2
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,163
"He would not take no
for an answer.

3
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,457
Our young hero traveled
a great many leagues

4
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,877
beneath the ocean's surface
to find his shackled mermaid,

5
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,838
and he had no intention
of leaving without her.

6
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,965
However, the evil sea king
had other plans.

7
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:53,385
Like a madman driven
by love and revenge,

8
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:56,305
the diver unsheathed
his speargun and fired.

9
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,390
His harpoon struck
the merman's heart,

10
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:01,852
and blood shot out
like a miniature geyser.

11
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,063
The bubble surrounding
the princess burst

12
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,648
as two tiger sharks ravaged
the king's lifeless body,

13
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:10,444
scattering his guts across the sea
like a quilted feather pillow.

14
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:15,074
Yet, amid the melee,
the diver bent down on one knee,

15
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:18,285
and his hand held out a small pearl.

16
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,162
The princess smiled.

17
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,789
'Don't bother,' she said.

18
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:25,417
'I've already packed.'

19
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,796
And so they rode off
on the back of a white whale,

20
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,924
and with a bouquet of plankton,
they were betrothed.

21
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,635
The End."

23
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,514
Very good, very good.

25
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,936
Thank you.

28
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,568
Okay, I thought that went well
back there, don't you?

29
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,737
Are you kidding me?
That was amazing.

30
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,572
It was so great to see you
in action back there.

31
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:56,615
Yeah, it felt good.

32
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:57,908
Tell me your thoughts on the ending.

33
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,785
What did you think of the diver
ending up with the mermaid?

34
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,078
You thought that was too easy?

35
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:01,995
Easy? No, not at all.

36
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,623
I mean, I felt that, like, it was
the only way that it could have ended.

37
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,375
Yeah, I agree, and I'm the writer.

38
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,167
Here we go.

39
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,544
Are -- are we in a rush
or something?

40
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,754
I'm not in a rush. We just got
a full weekend ahead of us.

41
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,422
We got so many things to do.
What is that?

42
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,383
Oh, just some books. . .
And this.

43
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,051
You -- you recommended this to me
a long time ago.

44
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,803
You said you felt like
it was written about you, so. . .

45
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,680
Yeah, well. . .

46
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,724
Those were my younger
and more vulnerable years.

47
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,602
Do you mind, sir?
This is a bike lane, not a parking lot.

48
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,187
Fuck you, asshole!

49
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:44,538
This is a lot of goddamn luggage
for three days, buddy.

50
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,332
We're not going on safari.
We're going on a vacation.

51
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,459
Well, I-I wasn't exactly sure
what to be prepared for.

52
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,420
I mean, you weren't very specific
over the phone.

53
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,421
I guess I wasn't.

54
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,089
And -- and, you know,
I wanted to look nice

55
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,716
if there was gonna be girls
at the hotel.

56
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,217
Yeah, there might be girls
at the hotel.

57
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,428
You need to relax, buddy.
That's not the point of the trip.

58
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,054
You don't have to worry yourself
about girls.

59
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,099
This trip is about us
going on boat rides in the sun.

60
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,852
We got to read some books.
I got to read things to you out loud.

61
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,770
You've been hiding from me
in your parents' apartment,

62
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:09,646
you little prince.

63
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,398
It's time to get you out of there.

64
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,275
Okay.

65
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:15,986
I mean, I don't really feel
like I've been hiding from you.

66
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,822
If anything, I feel like you've
been hiding from me, maybe.

67
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,074
I feel like we had lunch
not that long ago.

68
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,620
No. No, I don't -- I'm not --

69
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,747
I don't think I've seen you
in like a year, Sam.

70
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,457
-A year?
-Yeah, at least.

71
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,708
A year?

72
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,835
I got a little present for you.

73
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,629
-What is this?
-Open it.

74
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,047
What?

75
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,132
It just reminds me of the buck knife
you used to carry around

76
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,592
in your belt loop
when we were campers.

77
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,177
Remember?
The one that I lost?

78
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,804
-Yeah.
-That's why I got it.

79
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:46,308
Whose, uh --
whose initials are these?

80
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,352
Those are yours, buddy.

81
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,686
No, it says N.B.

82
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,438
No, I know,
that's my friend Noah Bressman.

83
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,858
He doesn't use it, though.
I took it from him.

84
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,401
Thank you.

85
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:58,153
It's. . . perfect, Sam.

86
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,696
Happy birthday, kid.

87
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:00,948
Thanks.

88
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,532
It's not my birthday, though.

89
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:06,036
I know it's not your birthday,
you silly goose.

90
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,872
Consider it early for next year.

91
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,916
Oh, my God.

92
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,919
I've just been so busy lately
with this book, Marshall.

93
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,338
That's what it is. That's why
I'm so lousy at keeping in touch.

94
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,757
I know, I know, I know,
it's -- it's fine, man.

95
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,550
It has nothing to do with you
personally, though.

96
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,718
-Yeah, and --
-You know that.

97
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:22,636
Yeah, no, I know.

98
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,429
I know I don't have to tell you that,
but I should.

99
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,723
And I do have to say that I think
it's really admirable that you're able

100
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,892
to, like, come up with these amazing
characters and everything

101
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,853
and still keep a real job
during the day, you know?

102
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,231
That is my real job, actually.

103
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,899
Waitress, can we get the check?

104
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,151
Thank you.

105
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,737
You know, I was about ready
to take on the job market myself.

106
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:41,780
I sent out some résumés,

107
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,407
took some meetings
that my dad set up,

108
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,575
and then, you know,
the whole disaster happened,

109
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,452
and I had to move back in
with my parents,

110
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,621
and, you know, at first
it was hard for me

111
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:50,831
to even leave my own room,

112
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,834
and before I knew it,
eight months had just flown on by.

113
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,086
Jesus Christ, Marshall,
that's what I'm saying.

114
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,255
The guy I know
used to be a crazed wild man.

115
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:01,466
You're nothing like that anymore.
What happened?

116
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,885
When did you start smoking?

117
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,929
Recently.

118
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,640
You probably shouldn't be doing it
at a gas station.

119
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:11,018
That's an old wives' tale, Marshall.

121
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,192
You're gonna love this hotel,
by the way, pal.

122
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,110
Really?

123
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,446
I'll tell you, it might as well
have a goddamn Michelin star.

124
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,488
What's it like?

125
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,615
It's very elegant, very warm,

126
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,326
got a real old-world
kind of flavor to it.

127
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,286
It's like they put the plaza
at the countryside.

128
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,663
Oh, I love that.

129
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,084
Right here.

130
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,297
Whoa, this is the place
we're staying at?

131
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,717
Uh, no. I think we made
a wrong turn, actually.

132
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,719
We're staying down the road, I think.

133
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,471
Oh. Huh.

135
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,892
Ah, she's got a lot of baggage.

136
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,978
Out of my way.
It's a wedding, everybody.

137
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:55,979
Let's get 'em.

138
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,191
Do you know these people
or something?

139
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,400
No, I don't know these people.

140
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,818
How the hell
would I know these people?

142
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,404
Can I help you, gentlemen?

143
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,947
Are you here for the weekend?

144
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,991
Uh, no, I think we're all right,
thanks, actually.

145
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,868
Yeah, we're -- we're not here
for the weekend.

146
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,703
We -- we were staying
down the road a piece.

147
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:12,913
We just made a wrong turn.

148
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,414
Then you should leave immediately.

149
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,084
This car is smoking profusely.

150
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,543
Unbelievable, that guy.

151
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,629
Honestly, can you believe that?

152
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:21,713
Yeah.

153
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,174
It was very condescending,
his tone, wasn't it?

154
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,093
I mean, I don't think
he did anything that bad.

155
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,594
I think he was just doing his job.

156
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,221
The place seemed really exclusive,
you know.

157
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,348
I mean, he just thought we were
middle class or something,

158
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,516
just by looking at us.

159
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,142
I mean, we are middle class.

160
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,812
Well, that's not the point.

161
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,523
Hey, pull over really fast.
I need to make a quick call.

162
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,315
Okay.

163
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,370
All righty, you should get us some
booze and snackies for the room.

164
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,538
I got to make a call.

165
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:55,831
Who are you gonna call?

166
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,833
Get whatever you'd like.
Anything.

167
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,752
You just gave me $2.

168
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:03,171
It should work.

169
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,683
Hi. It's Sam.

171
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,110
Hi. It's Sam.

172
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,904
Yeah, hi. It's Sam.

173
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,322
Hi. It's Sam.

175
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,294
Hoo. . .

176
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,592
Chief, can you just run the card
one more time?

177
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,760
Just run the card
one more time, sir.

178
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,180
Run the goddamn card
one more time, please?

179
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,598
He's giving me
the silent treatment.

180
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,433
You're gonna have to give me
your wallet, Marshall.

181
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,393
This guy's treating me
like I'm a frickin' criminal.

182
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,937
Let me explain something to you, sir.
I put money on this card last week.

183
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,273
There's no reason why this card
shouldn't be working right now.

184
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,609
That's the card, by the way.
That should go through.

185
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,110
Sorry, Marshall.
I'm gonna pay you back.

186
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,487
I put money on the card last week.

187
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,613
It's okay.
Just calm down.

188
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,574
I can't calm down, Marshall.
You should be angry, too.

189
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,743
How could it be unlisted?
I was just there.

190
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,579
It's a big white house
with blue shutters.

191
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:18,663
Or maybe they're black.

192
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,290
Does that make any difference
whatsoever?

193
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,708
I'm not authorized
to give you...

194
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,793
No, you're the phone company.
You're supposed to know everything.

195
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,462
-There's no hot water.
-I'm sorry. I can't heIp you.

196
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,422
Oh, and I was just made aware
there's no hot water in the room.

197
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,049
How are you gonna run a hotel
with no hot water?

198
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,634
Anything else, Marshall?

199
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,177
There was a bit of hair in the drain.

200
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,054
And there was a full head of hair
in the drain.

201
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,805
So if you can get a maid up
or an electrician,

202
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,557
I would really appreciate that,
thank you.

203
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,725
I'm sorry, Marshall.

204
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:40,644
I'm just not gonna let
some two-bit lndian

205
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,021
treat me like a maniac, you know?

206
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,232
It's fine. I didn't even think
he really did anything.

207
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,442
Went completely numb.
Marshall, I apologize.

208
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:50,403
I know this was supposed to be
a very relaxing weekend,

209
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,822
your first weekend
being out of the house in a year.

210
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,700
I mean, your actions
were a little overwhelming,

211
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:59,829
but I'm just glad
that I'm unpacked and settled in.

212
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,250
If I could just take a chance
to relax for a little while.

213
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,751
Let's go to the pool.

214
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:10,257
You know, I've got
to tell you, I'm only on page 37,

215
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,592
but so far, I totally get
what you're saying about this guy.

216
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,511
I feel like it's written
about me or something.

217
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:15,720
It's kind of haunting.

218
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,848
You know what I think?

219
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:22,769
I think we need to get out of here
and have ourselves a drinky.

220
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,271
True or false --

221
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,106
you want to meet some women
on this trip, right?

222
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,859
I mean, true, but it's not the most
important thing in the world to me.

223
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,361
I mean, just sitting here
by the pool with you

224
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,196
is probably the most exciting thing
I've done all year.

225
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,865
Right. That's all the more reason
why we should keep pushing forward.

226
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:36,950
Look, see for yourself.

227
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,328
There's a very interesting thing
going on down the beach over there.

228
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,622
They're all old people.

229
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,333
Exactly, Marshall.
They're gonna love you.

230
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,003
It looks like a blast, man.
It's just. . .

231
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,838
I don't know if I'm ready to dive

232
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,674
into a stressful social situation
like that right now, you know?

233
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,426
That's the whole point
of the trip, Marshall.

234
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,219
We got to do this
for ourselves, for you.

235
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,721
This is your coming-out party.

236
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,058
Well, I guess we could stop by
for a minute,

237
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,603
but I can't exactly go over there
in my swim trunks, now, can l?

238
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,730
No. But you brought a suit, right?

239
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,398
Well, yeah, you told me
to bring one just in case,

240
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,608
but I'd have to sticky-roll it.

241
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,193
Well, sticky-roll that thing
and blow this joint.

243
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,706
Why are we
sneaking around like this?

244
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,083
We're not sneaking around.
We're being mysterious.

245
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,753
Look, Marshall, it's sunny out.

246
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,297
I still don't get what I'm supposed
to say to these people.

247
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,008
You just pretend like you fit in,
and you'll be fine.

248
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,926
It'll be like the time we went
to the Harmony Club

249
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,179
and took steam showers
with all those old guys.

250
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,764
They didn't question us, did they?

251
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,182
We just need to find somebody

252
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,517
who can help us get acclimated
to the party, you know,

253
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,685
ease into it a little bit.

254
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,729
Then when the time is right,
we'll peacock ourselves around

255
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,939
and show ourselves off
to some of these older women,

256
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:50,815
you know what I mean?

257
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,651
By the way, feel free
to make shit up about yourself,

258
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:53,943
like a job or something.

259
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,236
This guy's perfect.

260
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,406
Hey, excuse me.
Ahoy, amigo!

262
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,119
He seems kind of strange.
Let's go.

263
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,372
Wait, don't go anywhere.

264
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,792
Is there a problem, Officers?

265
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,627
I haven't done anything.

266
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:11,628
Let me ask you a question.

267
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,254
What's a guy like you
doing by yourself

268
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,131
when the party's over there?

269
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,467
Just hanging out
by the ocean, Officer.

270
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,010
Well, we're, you know,
down on the beach,

271
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,804
and your party's rattling
our walls a little bit.

272
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,305
What kind of dragon
do I have to slay

273
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,640
to get a drink around these parts?

275
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,395
Pow! Pow!

276
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,272
I'm really glad you guys are here.

277
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,982
I was getting a little bit bored,
to be honest.

278
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,317
Well, aren't these all your friends?

279
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:35,777
No, none of these people
are my friends.

280
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,070
They don't even like each other.

281
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,488
Huh, you can say that again, right?

282
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,490
That's why everybody drinks
and there are so many pills.

283
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,991
Hey, speaking of drinking, let's drink.

285
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:43,493
Hey, oh!

286
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,995
-Save some for me.
-Hey, there she is.

287
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,080
Hey, believe it or not,

288
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,124
but this one's been
in a ladies' prison, boys.

289
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,459
Really? That's funny.
So has Marshall. May l?

290
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,671
Oh, I love the flavor of this brand.
Very smooth.

291
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,548
Yeah, you'd like it a lot more
if you inhaled it.

292
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:57,966
No. I-I did.

293
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:01,302
Sweetie, look, dolphins!

294
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,141
It's terrible.

295
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,268
All right.

296
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,270
This is the smartest thing
we've ever done, by the way.

297
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,563
So, what do we do now?

298
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,022
What do you mean,
what do we do now?

299
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,734
Who do you like?
What girl?

300
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,362
I mean, she's kind of beautiful
in a sad kind of way.

301
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,697
Everybody here is sad, Marshall.

302
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,699
That's why we could really clean up
in a place like this.

303
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,034
However, I don't think
you should be focused on the maid.

304
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,036
I would focus on that redhead
over there, though.

305
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,455
She seems elegant.

306
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:30,206
She'd be lucky to have sex with you.

307
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,709
She's laughing at us.

308
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:33,918
Laugh back at her.

310
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,880
No, that's what these people
do here, Marshall.

311
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,548
They laugh at you.

312
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:39,758
That's why we could really clean up.

313
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,551
Because we're the young bloods.
You know what I mean?

314
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,137
Apparently, he arranged
a screening at some theater. . .

315
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,931
Uh, uh, I think I got something.
Let's go fishing.

316
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,892
Right. Right. I heard
it was her favorite movie.

317
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,435
"Brief" something or other.

318
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,936
-"Brief Encounter."
-What?

319
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,688
"Brief Encounter" --
the film you were talking about.

320
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,440
It's based on Noel Coward's play
called "Still Life,"

321
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,232
which came out in '36.

322
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,901
You guys might have been around
for that, actually.

323
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,319
-Who are you?
-Oh, I'm Sam Davis.

324
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,069
Nice to meet you.

325
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,447
I'm a published author of several
children's stories and such.

326
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,031
Oh.

327
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,491
This is my friend Marshall,
by the way.

328
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,284
-Marshall, say hi to the captain.
-Hi.

329
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,620
Tell them what you do, Marshall.

330
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,289
Oh, I-I don't actually
do anything right now.

331
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,583
I haven't really been
in a healthy enough state

332
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,044
to even fathom holding down
a real job, you know.

333
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,754
Marshall's a comedian, actually.

334
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,256
No. The truth is,
that I've just been going

335
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,925
through kind of a rough patch
right now,

336
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,927
and so I haven't really been
putting myself out there.

337
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,722
Just been too exhausted,
but, uh --

338
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,059
uh, when I do, I think
I might want to be an actor.

339
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,685
Or a sea captain.

340
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,396
How do you get into that?

341
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,044
Excuse me.

342
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,467
-Look at you.
-What are you doing here?

343
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,094
Oh, my God,
you look amazing right now.

344
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,470
Honestly, you are such a sight.

345
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,681
-Look at you in this light.
-Answer the question, Sam.

346
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,266
Have you grown?
I think you've grown.

347
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,810
Maybe it's just your posture,
but you seem a little taller.

348
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:14,519
I don't know. . .

349
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,563
Seriously, Sam, what the fuck
are you doing here?

350
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,565
What are you talking about?
Your brother invited me.

351
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,192
-Why are you acting like this?
-You've never even met my brother.

352
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,527
That's not true, actually.

353
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,112
We just met down
on the other side of the beach,

354
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,655
and he invited me to come
and have a few drinks

355
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:26,823
and say hi, so I'm just saying hi.

356
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,909
You can't be here, Sam.
You have to leave.

357
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,494
Didn't you get my postcard?

358
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,997
Which postcard?
You send me a lot of postcards.

359
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,082
Why are you acting like this?
I haven't seen your face. . .

360
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,166
Hey, look at this.

361
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,460
-That's my sister, Zoe, man.
-Yes, it is.

362
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:40,712
Isn't she pretty?

363
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,006
Coincidentally, your sister and l
have already met,

364
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,258
and I agree --
she's completely beautiful.

365
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,259
-No.
-All right.

366
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,678
-So, Teddy, you met Sam, then, yeah?
-Thank you, Teddy.

367
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,138
-Yeah.
-Sam Davis.

368
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,348
Oh, Sammy Davis.

370
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:55,977
You sly fox, man.

371
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:56,728
No. . .

372
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,856
All right. Well, I'm gonna go
find your friend, man.

373
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,107
It's on me.

374
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,192
-You brought a friend?
-Yeah, he drives.

375
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,903
Listen, do you want to go somewhere
and get a drink?

376
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:05,528
Oh, my God.

377
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,405
No, I -- no, I can't, okay?

378
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,782
-I would like to talk to you.
-No.

379
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,534
No, no, no, no.
You have got to leave now.

380
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,702
I'm not going anywhere.

381
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,746
Oh, there she is --
my beautiful, elusive woman.

382
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:15,580
Can I steal you away

383
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,373
to take a few pictures
with the photographer?

384
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,374
-Of course.
-Who are you?

385
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,084
Are you. . .?
This is Whit.

386
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,712
I'm -- Whit, I'm Sam Davis.
Pleasure to finally meet you.

387
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:23,212
Sam.

388
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,589
I've heard many,
many things about you.

389
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:25,590
Zoe's told me many things.

390
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,217
-Oh. Big Sam.
-Mm-hmm.

391
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,053
Of course you are!

392
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,180
Come here! Oh, my God!

393
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:32,889
Oh, my God.

394
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,642
Finally, a chance to meet
the famous Sam Davis!

395
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,559
Yeah.

396
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,896
Darling, you didn't tell me you invited
Big Sam for the weekend.

397
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,482
I didn't, but Sam's. . .

398
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,109
. . .not gonna stay very long.

399
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,028
Yeah, no.
I won't be staying long at all.

400
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,363
It's really just a funny coincidence,

401
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,740
because our hotel shares a beach
with your miniature castle over here,

402
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:51,699
and, uh, we ran into Teddy,

403
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:54,911
and he invited me to say hi,
so, just saying hi.

404
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,288
You'll have to forgive me,
but the way Zoe speaks of you,

405
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,916
I always sort of imagined
this tall, strapping fellow,

406
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,919
what with all the "Sam sent me this"
and "Sam wrote me that."

407
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:03,920
Right.

408
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,881
You're far slighter than I imagined.

409
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,051
Well, it looks like Zoe's telling you
some tall tales, then, I guess.

411
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,597
He is funny.
You were right.

412
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:18,059
Hey, you Mick, you've got a lot
of fucking nerve showing up here.

413
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,602
Oh, come on.
Thanks for inviting me.

414
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:22,689
I will take out your fucking
front two teeth if you keep this up.

415
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,316
-Isn't he something?
-What's with the little mustache?

416
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,777
What?
I forgot I even had it, actually.

417
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,195
Do you like it?

418
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,114
Hmm. I like you better without it.

419
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,032
Fuck off, but do me a favor
and stay close by

420
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,284
'cause I want to talk to you
about the idea I just had.

421
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,369
I'm so sorry about that.

422
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,580
Bruce and I spearhead
the Little Foot Foundation together.

423
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,458
We made 1 0,000 pairs
of open-toed adjustable sandals

424
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:45,586
just last year
for poor African children.

425
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,338
Makes me feel good, you know?

426
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,966
Yeah, it should. Huh.

427
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,467
-You need a drink.
-Yeah.

428
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:54,429
So, tell me, Sam, where was it
you said you were staying?

429
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,556
My friend Marshall and l
are staying at this neat

430
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,975
little native American place
called "The Little Mohican lnn."

431
00:16:59,101 --> 00:16:59,976
It's a fantastic place.

432
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,853
You guys should go
if you ever have an opportunity.

433
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,771
Now, listen, Sam, we've got
to take this photograph,

434
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:04,772
but it seems a bloody waste

435
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,649
for you and Marvin to stay
in that lndian shit hole

436
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,484
when we've got this big,
lovely house all to ourselves.

437
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,445
No. No, no, no, no, no!
Every room is. . .

438
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,988
-Aren't you gorgeous?
-. . .full. . .

439
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,656
. . .in the house.

440
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,200
I'm sure we can find a place
for these two to bunk up in.

441
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,411
It's your rule --
the more the merrier.

442
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,913
You know, it's so rare
that we have the whole gang out

443
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,459
to celebrate
such a gorgeous occasion.

444
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:27,295
Oh, yeah, what is the occasion,
by the way?

445
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,880
You haven't told him, have you?

446
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,381
Of course I have.

447
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,092
No, no, no, no, you haven't told me.
I don't know what's going on.

448
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,344
Somebody, please,
tell me the good news finally.

449
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,348
Zoe and I are getting married
on Sunday.

450
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,058
Yes!

451
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,310
Married?! Really?

452
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,438
And it's my birthday!

453
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,356
That where I got. . .
And here, too.

454
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,733
You can't really see a scar, though,

455
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,234
because I have
an amazing plastic surgeon.

456
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,611
Excuse us for a moment.
Hey, pal.

457
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,571
-What am I, a fucking waitress?
-Oh, my goodness.

458
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,698
I thought we made an agreement
to lie about ourselves.

459
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,034
Yeah, but I hate lying.
I'm terrible at it.

460
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,786
Oh, you'll get better, trust me.

461
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,537
Who are those people
you were talking to?

462
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,539
I think I recognize that guy
from someplace.

463
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,249
Funny enough, those are
some acquaintances of mine

464
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,626
that are staying here
for the weekend.

465
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,377
And I've told you
about my friend Zoe, have I not?

466
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,296
-No.
-No? Doesn't matter. Anyway. . .

467
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,715
Uh, listen, I think we should
check out of the Mohican

468
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,217
and stay here for the weekend.

469
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,343
What do you mean?

470
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:18,054
Well, I mean, I was just extended
the invitation for both of us,

471
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,680
and I think we ought to take it.

472
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,057
But I love the Mohican.

473
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,225
It's got a lot of character.

474
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,393
Marshall, people only say that
about terrible things

475
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,770
when they're trying to be nice.

476
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,063
I mean, look around, pal.

477
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,607
Every single person here
wants to know who we are,

478
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,360
especially that spunky-looking
redhead over there.

479
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,361
What's her name?

480
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,821
-Esme.
-Esme. Exactly.

481
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,614
And I'm sure that sad maid
is around here somewhere

482
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,698
lurking around.

483
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,492
Those are two very
realistic options for you.

484
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,828
You're not gonna get a deal
like that at the Mohican.

485
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,704
I just -- I don't feel like we'd be able

486
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,374
to spend as much quality time
together if we stayed here.

487
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,919
Buddy, listen, this is
a golden opportunity here.

488
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,629
Okay? I'm just saying.

489
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:55,383
I mean. . . It's your call.

490
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,301
I told you what I feel.

491
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,595
You tell me what you feel.

492
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,764
I feel like. . .

493
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,183
I want to stay at the Mohican.

494
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,310
Okay.

496
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,396
Third floor, menswear.

497
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:11,357
That old boy
put you on the third floor.

498
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,151
Marshall, I don't want
to beat the dead horse,

499
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,902
but remember, you don't
have to explain everything

500
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,529
to everyone all the time,
you know what I mean?

501
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,197
Just pepper in a little subtlety
here and there.

502
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:18,865
Trust me.

503
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,116
What, you're saying I'm too obvious?

504
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,451
-I would never say that. Ever.
-Keep up!

506
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,998
This place is like a playground.

507
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,333
You have a canoe,
you have golf clubs.

508
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,294
You have every sort of ball
known to mankind.

509
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,713
-It is what it is, man.
-This place is incredible. I love it.

510
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:34,881
I wouldn't put you here.

511
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,799
Little more subtle, Marshall.

513
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,804
-What's that smell?
-Cat shit.

514
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,347
Zoe loves cats, right?

515
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,974
She's got strays running all over,

516
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,393
and they all take shits
under your bed, man.

517
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,437
-Are they rescues?
-Yeah, they're rescues.

518
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:52,690
She rescues cats, dogs, gerbils --
anything, man.

519
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:53,900
SAM:
God, that sister of yours.

520
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,568
She's always taking care
of everybody.

521
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,445
She's got a lot of love to give,
doesn't she?

522
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,779
She's the best.

523
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,740
She took care of me
from day one on, so. . .

524
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,658
Look how good you turned out,
big guy.

526
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:04,493
Uh-huh.

527
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,786
Look, I want to be the guy

528
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,580
who takes care of you guys
this weekend, okay?

529
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,789
It's my sister's wedding.

530
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,124
She wants everybody to have fun.

531
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,002
So if you guys need anything --
you know, coke, pills. . .

532
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,172
Oh, actually, I could really use
a ginger ale and, like, an aspirin.

533
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,715
I kind of got, like, a sinus thing, so. . .

535
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,053
I don't smoke.

536
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,846
Good boy.

537
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,849
I like that. Good answer.

538
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,601
Move your shit, man.

539
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,019
Move it right now.

540
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,604
Get out of my way, man.

541
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,189
Hey, it's a wedding, everybody.

542
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,232
See you, Big Ted.

543
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,858
I'm gonna call him Uncle Teddy.

544
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,944
It's hot in here.
It's really hot in here.

545
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,322
It's not that hot.
That's what the fan is for.

548
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,483
One of the cats shit in the bathtub.

549
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,235
They're a bunch of strays,
Marshall.

550
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,611
I'm just glad they have a home.

551
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:21,612
What is that?

552
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,073
Just, like, a little gift basket.
It was left outside the door.

553
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,409
Really? Presents?

554
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,077
Were you reading my journal?

555
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,079
Yeah. Marshall. . .

556
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,415
When did you start
keeping a journal?

557
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,083
Like, about a year ago.

558
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,710
You're a pretty goddamn good writer.

559
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,754
Yeah. My therapist thought
it would be a good idea.

560
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,298
And I know you
used to have one, and. . .

561
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,799
You're in therapy?

562
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,302
-Yeah. Big-time.
-Why?

563
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,469
Got a lot of problems.

564
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,680
How many problems
can you have, Marshall?

565
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,766
You're 25 years old.

566
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,270
Quite a few.

567
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,147
Jesus Christ, Marshall.

568
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,858
You should prepare me before
you tell me something like that.

569
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,735
That's shocking.

570
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,281
What kind of stuff they got here?

571
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:08,367
Oh, a note.

572
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,584
How long
have you known Zoe, exactly?

573
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,129
Not long.

574
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:23,632
Um, we're just, you know. . .

575
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,259
friends of a friend --
that sort of thing.

576
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,427
I'm gonna take a shower, buddy.

577
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,805
You should spruce up
and, uh, get ready for supper.

578
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,307
Let's not be late, all right?

579
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,267
-Oh, there's no hot water in there.
-That's fine.

581
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:45,112
That is very funny,
and you are, yes, a very sad man.

582
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,198
Who wants to hear the story
of how we met?

583
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,158
'Cause I only want to tell
this story once.

584
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:50,701
There may be three people
at the table

585
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:51,994
that haven't heard this story.

586
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,830
Do you know, when I first
asked Zoe to dinner,

587
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:55,998
she laughed in my face.

588
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,625
No, I didn't laugh.
I didn't laugh.

589
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:00,044
No, it was. . .
It was an innocent guffaw.

590
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,837
Oh, what happened
to your mustache?

591
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,214
I look better without it.

592
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,050
Can you not be so observant
all the time? Thank you.

593
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:09,970
I hounded this girl for a month
to get one dinner with her.

594
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,640
I sent flowers to the store
where she worked.

595
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,517
You did send flowers,
and they were beautiful.

596
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,644
So I practically stalked you, didn't l?

599
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,526
Oh, that's charming.

600
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,653
God, here we go.

601
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,198
Very funny, everybody, laugh it up.

602
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:32,535
It's a wedding!

603
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,995
For all you guys who don't know me,
my name's Teddy.

604
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,706
That's my sister.

605
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:41,043
And our parents are dead.

608
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,465
Everybody dies.

609
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,552
It was a long time ago,
and we're doing okay now,

610
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,263
so don't worry about it.

611
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:55,808
So congratulations
from the family.

612
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,726
I love you very much.

613
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,146
-I love you, Teddy.
-I really, really do.

614
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,730
You're one of the good ones.

615
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,566
And you stuck with me

616
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,402
when I was all the way down,
you know?

617
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,279
And you always have.

618
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:11,991
There's all these snakes
in this world, but not you.

619
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,326
And it's time, you know,
you're moving on,

620
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,996
and I'm happy for you, but I'm just
going through a shit period for me,

621
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,707
and so I'm just sad. . . I'm. . .

622
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,834
I'm just sad that you're leaving,
that's all.

623
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,377
I'm not going anywhere, Teddy.

624
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:24,712
Me, neither, Teddy.

626
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,215
Cheers, everyone.
It's a wedding. Have fun.

627
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,300
What are you gonna do about it?

628
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,759
Thank you, cheers.
Cheers, Teddy.

629
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:31,469
Eat it up, boy.

630
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,597
Your candor and brevity
are always so much appreciated.

631
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,390
I fucked that up.

632
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,933
Um, so, um, let me keep this brief

633
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,102
'cause you all know how much
I hate giving speeches,

634
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:43,856
but, um --
could you just film this?

635
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:47,193
I'm baring my soul here.
You know, catch the moment.

636
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,402
Here we go.

637
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,905
Uh, do you know,
when you spend a year in a tent

638
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,200
in the African bush, you learn
to appreciate the little things in life,

639
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:58,871
like running water and the taste
of a decent cheeseburger.

641
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:04,543
You learn to appreciate
being home around your friends,

642
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,337
around your family,

643
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,464
around the people
who mean most to you

644
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,050
in this unforgiving world.

645
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:14,303
Zoe. . .

647
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:17,932
What?

648
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,809
I would be lying if I didn't say
that loving you

649
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,145
has been the great adventure
of my life.

650
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,272
And I make films in Africa.

652
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:31,153
And coercing you
into finally marrying me

653
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,658
has been by far
my greatest achievement.

654
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,079
Other than that Oscar.

656
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,625
I'm joking! I'm joking!

657
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,043
-I am joking.
-You're not joking.

658
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:47,962
-You're dead serious.
-I love you.

660
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,090
I love you.

661
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:53,926
Cheers, cheers, cheers.

662
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,762
I toast to you,

663
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,057
to old friends and new ones.

664
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:03,435
I've got such huge love
for everyone at this ta--

666
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,063
-Uh-oh.
-Cheers.

667
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,398
Hi, everyone. Cheers.

668
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,650
Cheers, Whit, Zoe.

669
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,735
Cheers, everyone here.

670
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:15,990
Um, well, I think I speak
for Marshall and myself

671
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:18,033
when I say that it's a pleasure. . .

672
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,952
Who's Marshall?

673
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,872
. . .to -- to witness the pairing
of two beautiful people.

674
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:29,295
Two. . . two dreamers, really,
who are about to, uh. . .

675
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:34,091
embark on a journey of love and. . .

676
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:36,135
. . .friendship.

677
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:39,888
Um, it's a rare thing
to see two people

678
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:43,559
who are so good-looking
involved with each other.

679
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,561
Um. . .

680
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:50,524
Anyway, uh, thank you, Whit,
for letting us stay here.

681
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:55,404
Uh, to new friends
and to old friends.

682
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,489
And, uh. . .

683
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:59,992
Whit. . .

684
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,494
You're a lucky man.

685
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,541
And, Zoe. . .

686
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,422
. . .Whit's a lucky man.

688
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,550
If you'll excuse me a moment.

689
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,552
MARSHALL:
Sam, where are you going?

690
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,429
Oh, no, Sam, you're gonna miss
the birthday cake.

692
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:22,765
Damn, just missed him.

693
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,099
Anyway, cheers, everyone.

694
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,894
I hope you have
a marvelous evening.

695
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,439
Really. Does everyone
have enough to drink?

697
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,073
Are you feeling all right?

698
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,617
You found me!

699
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,410
Oh. I'm fine.

700
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:47,164
I just think I got a bad case
of food poisoning.

701
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:51,251
So sweet of you to come out here
and check up on me like this.

702
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,836
Unbelievable, right?

703
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,588
You'd think
with all the money this guy has,

704
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,674
he'd serve some decent food
in this joint.

705
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,716
Are you drunk?

706
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,803
You know what? That's it.
I drank on an empty stomach.

707
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,471
You should never do that, Marshall.

708
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,181
Come on.
Let's take a breath.

709
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,933
How'd you like my speech?

710
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,851
It's a tough crowd out there.

711
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,061
You and Zoe --

712
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,855
You never had, like,
a-a thing, did you?

713
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,316
What does that mean?
What's a thing?

714
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,735
I don't know, it's just,
she kind of looks at you oddly,

715
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,947
and you always breathe
really funny whenever she's around.

716
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,657
And I was just flipping
through your story again,

717
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,325
it just seems
like there's a lot of parallels.

718
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,994
Right. Have you ever
written anything, Marshall?

719
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,621
Just in my journal.

720
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,373
Well, let me explain
something to you, pal.

721
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,709
Let me explain to you
what us writers like to do.

722
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,627
We make things up --
amalgams, okay?

723
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:34,795
And what are amalgams?

724
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,131
They're things or characters
based on other things or characters

725
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,757
sort of all mixed together into one.

726
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,552
Now, while Zoe up there and l
are friends,

727
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,345
and I do find her kind of interesting,

728
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,431
she's just a small part
of a bigger whole.

729
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,308
Tiny, insignificant part
of that mermaid from my story.

730
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,686
She's a mixture of a lot
of different girls that I know.

731
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,105
Kind of like scrambled eggs.
Does that make any sense?

732
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:57,568
No. I think I'm having
a hard time articulating

733
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,361
what I'm feeling right now.

734
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:00,529
I think it's fear.

735
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,865
It's not because I don't trust you,
because I do. I just --

736
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,700
Marshall, let me explain
something to you.

737
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,702
One of my best-received stories
was loosely based

738
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,746
on the time that you and l
tried to steal Cleopatra's obelisk

739
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,914
from Central Park.
Remember that?

740
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,583
But I couldn't use you and l
in the story

741
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:15,878
because we're not interesting,
so I had to replace us with bandits.

742
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,630
Because bandits are far more
interesting than normal people.

743
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:19,840
That make sense?

744
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,925
I didn't know you wrote one
about us.

745
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:24,219
Didn't you get a signed copy
in the mail?

746
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:27,014
Well, God damn it. Remind me,
and I'll resend you one.

747
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,391
Come on. Let's get back out there
and loosen up a little bit.

748
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:30,476
How's my breath?

750
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,314
You should probably
brush your teeth.

751
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,691
Thank you for always being
so honest with me.

752
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:44,364
Okay.

754
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,245
It looks like our lion friend
has found a gazelle.

755
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:52,748
I don't know
who I identify with most --

756
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:56,084
am I the predator,
or am I the prey?

757
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,879
Being here,
I see a pure way of Iiving.

758
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:02,591
America seems to me
so very far away...

759
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:07,012
a vile, putrid place
that I never want to see again.

760
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,223
All right, now, guys,
this is just a rough cut,

761
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:12,768
but I just thought that, since
I had you all together in one place,

762
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:13,977
I could get your notes

763
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:16,647
and help raise a bit of awareness
in the process.

764
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,607
You know, and that's why
I've got some questionnaires

765
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:19,983
for everyone to fill out afterwards.

766
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:22,277
Completely optional, of course.

767
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:26,156
I just want to stay here
and hold you forever.

768
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,868
Who is that woman?

769
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,411
That's my wife.

770
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,872
So she is.

771
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:34,998
Right.

772
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,796
-Be right back.
-Right, right.

773
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,215
My friend the chief has just
offered me 30 head of cattle.

774
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,217
Lean, darling.
You're blocking the most brilliant. . .

775
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,594
Τhat's a lot of cows.

776
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:48,929
What the. . .?!

778
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,640
What the hell's
the matter with you?!

779
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,433
Have you gone out of your mind?!

780
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,601
Maybe.

783
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,483
That stays on.

784
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,485
I've never been slapped before.
That hurt, kind of.

785
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:06,572
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to do it quite so hard.

786
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:07,489
Well, you did.

787
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:08,949
What happened to your mustache?

788
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:10,158
-I shaved it off.
-Why?

789
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,493
'Cause you told me to.

790
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,161
What are you still doing here?

791
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,830
The whole reason
I wrote you the postcard

792
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,123
was to avoid this from happening.

793
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,250
You know, well, maybe you shouldn't
send postcards to people

794
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,168
to notify them of heartbreaking news.

795
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,170
What exactly is your objective?

796
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,339
It seems like I'm in the process
of winning you back.

797
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,466
No! I am getting married
in two days.

798
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:27,885
I am engaged.

799
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,136
I've always been engaged.

800
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,138
I never thought you were actually
gonna go through with it.

801
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,598
What happened
to our weekend in the city?

802
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,600
We were supposed to be alone
together. What happened?

803
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,727
Whit thought it would be nice
to just schedule our wedding

804
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,146
while he already had everyone here
for his birthday weekend.

805
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:42,024
Hold on. Nothing about
that statement seems odd to you?

806
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,484
Didn't you read anything I wrote?

807
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,695
You know what? I can't believe
you're actually considering this guy

808
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:47,696
as a serious option for you.

809
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,364
He's screening his movie
at his wedding reception?

810
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,699
What kind of man
are we dealing with here?

811
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,118
Shh!
You are being childish.

812
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,703
So are you.

814
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:04,254
Sam, please, save yourself
the heartache and go home.

815
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,258
No.

816
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:11,053
No. If you refuse
not to complicate my life,

817
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,805
the least you can do is introduce
yourself to one of my bridesmaids.

818
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,892
I'm sure they're just as desperate
as you to get their rocks off.

819
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:20,938
I meant that in the least
offensive way possible.

820
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:25,692
And, Sam,
stop standing on your toes.

821
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:29,488
I like you the way you were.

824
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,504
-Sammy!
-Hey, guys.

825
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,964

00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,341
I feel fine.
Feel invigorated, actually.

00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,468
Let's put a tiara on Sam.

828
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,137
Thank you.

829
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,848
You want some pills
to go with that tiara, Princess?

830
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,642
-I'd love some.
-Yes, you do.

831
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:01,186
We convinced this old boy
to partake with us.

832
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,980
He's a marathon boy.

833
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,439
My heart feels like it's metal.

835
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,734
It's nice to see you loosening up
a little bit there, pal.

836
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,945
-Do it, do it, do it!
-All right, I'll show you, okay.

837
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,739

out there dancing later.

Ready? Come on.
Ready? Two, three, four.

842
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,046
I'll take one less than he's had.

00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,090
Help yourself, man.
On the house.

844
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,884
Drink lots of water.
It really helps.

846
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:38,306
Does it make you forget
about things or what?

847
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,726

00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,975
I think I'm a little old for you.

908
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,227
Well, I may be young,
but I wasn't born yesterday.

909
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,228
I don't -- I don't --

910
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,313
I don't understand
what you're trying to say.

911
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:53,316
Honestly, I took a pill,
and I've been blacking out ever since.

912
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:57,445
Quick, make-believe
I said something really funny.

914
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:03,994
Mmm. Funny.

915
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:04,744
Why?

916
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,413
I don't know.
I-I like you.

917
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,914
♪ C'est la vie, c'est la vie... ♪

920
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,297

921
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:16,590
Come on. Try it.

923
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:18,133
Oh!

925
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,681
You, uh. . . you remind me
of someone,

926
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,349
and I really like it.

929
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:30,854
It's crazy out there, you know.

930
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,898
It's like, one minute you're just
walking down the street

931
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,024
minding your own business,

932
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,359
and then, all of a sudden,
there's a psychopath in a jumpsuit

933
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:37,611
asking you for the time.

934
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,946
And then I'm waking up
in a hospital bed in Lenox Hill

935
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:41,406
with blood all over my sport coat.

936
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,365
Mmm.

937
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,951
What? No, I mean it.

938
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:46,620
You want to put
your glasses on me?

939
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:47,537
Mm-hmm.

940
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:50,123
-You find me attractive like that?
-Mm-hmm.

942
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:58,256
Want to make out?

944
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,968
Okay.

945
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,303

946
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:06,348

You have a beautiful face.
I think it'd be time for us to kiss now.

950
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,695
Hello, darling. Bedtime.

951
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:23,782
Oh, no, we were in the middle
of a conversation.

953
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,286
Hey. Uh. . . oh, hi.
Have you guys seen my shoes?

954
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:31,665
I have -- I have these loafers.
They're. . .

955
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,041
Uh. . .

957
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,252
Okay, uh. . .

958
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:36,836
Hi. Hey. Um, do you have. . .?

959
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:40,715
Uh, do you know
where I can find my shoes?

960
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:45,262
Teddy, Teddy, I need my shoes.

961
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,513
Pow, pow, pow.

962
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,847
Your shoes are mine, boy!

963
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:52,102
Okay. Uh. . . my room is this way.

964
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:56,022
Oh, hello.

965
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,899
Is this where you dwell?

967
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:10,453
Okay, it's hot.

968
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:12,956
Oh, that's better.

970
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:21,298
-Am I gonna die?
-No, pal.

971
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,674
Here, have some cheese plate.

972
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,884
It'll slow your heart down.
Come on.

973
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,345
Get some food in your little tummy.

974
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,389
So, how'd it go with your lady?

975
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,433
Who, Margaret?
Went well, actually.

976
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,727
We had sex --
twice, back-to-back.

977
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,146
-ln a row?
-Mm-hmm.

978
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,816
What's it like. . . to screw on pills?

980
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,278
What do you say you and I forget
about the pills from now on, huh?

981
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:44,946
We don't need them.

982
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:46,990
How'd it go with your girl?

983
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,867
Not that good.

984
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,828
I walked in on the blond maid
in the closet crying.

985
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:53,204
And Esme -- she's got, like,

986
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,957
some sort of husband
or something, apparently.

987
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:59,669
Don't you worry, pal.
You reacted perfectly.

988
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:03,173
You're so much better than her,
it kills me.

989
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,633
You kill me.

990
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,056
Why do you think she's with him?

991
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,016
Esme?

992
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:15,352
I don't really know
that much about her.

993
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:19,439
No, I mean Zoe and Whit.
Why do you think she's with him?

994
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:22,442
Oh. I bet it has something to do
with her father.

995
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:25,945
My therapist says that a lot of things
have to do with your father.

996
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,241
Marshall, you're so goddamn intuitive.

997
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,452
l'm sure it has something to do
with her being an orphan.

998
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:35,747
I mean, it's probably damaged
her judgment in some way.

999
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:41,044
And also, she just seems
like the type of girl

1000
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,629
who, you know,
likes to be taken care of,

1001
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,672
and Whit clearly does that.

1002
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,634
He's a really good-looking guy,
successful, tall.

1003
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,387
-Really?
-Yeah.

1004
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,013
What, you think he's handsome?

1005
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,474
Yeah.

1006
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:58,228
Marshall, your penis
looks tremendous right now.

1007
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,562
What?

1009
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:05,485
You have a tremendous penis,
Marshall!

1011
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,156
Hello?

1012
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,127
Hi.

1013
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,379
Um. . .

1014
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,840
I couldn't sleep.

1015
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,300
I need you to take a bath.

1016
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:31,261
There's no hot water.

1017
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,930
Hey. Pretend like
it's a swimming pool.

1018
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,268
Take the cheese plate.

1019
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:41,896
-Hey.
-Hi.

1020
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:44,983
Wasn't really expecting company.
The place is a bit of a pigsty.

1021
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,986
Marshall is a bit of a slob.

1022
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:51,781
Is he gonna be okay in there?

1023
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,950
Yeah, he's fine.
Marshall loves baths.

1024
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:55,910
He's my little son.
He's my sidekick.

1025
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:58,204
He was having
a hard time with Esme.

1026
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:58,955
Really?

1027
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:01,499
He was telling her something
about how he got pistol-whipped.

1028
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,417
Yeah.

1029
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:09,757
I am staying in my sleeping bag,
so don't get any ideas.

1030
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:13,011
You and Margaret
seemed to really hit it off.

1031
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:16,014
Hmm? How'd it work out
for the two of you?

1032
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,599
She was very responsive.

1033
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,101
Oh. Well, she better be.
She's had a lot of practice.

1034
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:21,561
Yeah, she knew what she was doing.

1035
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:22,896
You sound awfully jealous

1036
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,148
for a woman
who's about to get married.

1037
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,483
What's the deal, man?

1038
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,361
What's that?

1039
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,739
Is this a new one?

1040
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,908
Why didn't you send it to me?

1041
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,118
Because I'm still workshopping it.

1042
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,500
"Chloe the Mermaid," huh?

1043
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,586
I can give you a brief synopsis
if you'd like.

1044
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:47,629
Would you like that?

1045
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:48,755
-I would.
-Okay.

1046
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,758
Well, it's about
a young deep-sea diver

1047
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:55,637
who's, uh, searching for pearls
on the bottom of the ocean floor.

1048
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,723
Anyway, our hero falls in love
with this mermaid

1049
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,100
who is involved in a fraudulent,
vapid relationship

1050
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,269
with a megalomaniacal,
arguably gay merman --

1051
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:04,854
you know, complete sociopath.

1052
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:08,483
The diver has to battle the merman
for the mermaid's heart.

1053
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,486
And, uh, there's a big fight scene
at the end.

1054
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:15,406
Not really sure how it all works out.

1055
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,868
It's better than the one
about the flying koala bear.

1056
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:20,578
Yeah.
That's one of my worst ones.

1057
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:28,211
What do you got there?
What's with the legal pad and pencil?

1058
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:34,050
Well, they're supposed to be my vows,
but they're all blank.

1059
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,302
I have to write them,
but I'm having some trouble.

1060
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:37,762
Uh-huh.

1061
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:41,599
I kind of need a writer's opinion.

1062
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,769
Did you come all the way in here
for me to work on your vows?

1063
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,897
Can you?

1064
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,111
Where do we start?

1065
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,654
That's where you come in.

1066
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,992
Wow. You're making
a real dent, I see.

1068
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:03,496
Okay. Well, um. . .

1069
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:06,124
I don't know.
What -- what do you like about him?

1070
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:10,670
Well, he's certainly not afraid
to be himself. That's for sure.

1071
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,131
Uh-huh.
Yeah, I can see that.

1072
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,049
For sure.

1073
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:16,968
Okay. Let's write that down.

1074
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,681
He makes me feel safe and secure.

1075
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:22,682
Mm-hmm.

1076
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:24,601
Takes care of me.

1077
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:27,061
-He's handsome. . .
-Okay.

1078
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,396
-Successful.
-Okay.

1079
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,565
This is all great, by the way.
What else?

1080
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,818
He's very strong-willed.

1081
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,696
Strong-willed -- good word.
These are really good.

1082
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,282
I mean, not afraid
to be himself -- clearly.

1083
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,951
I mean, anybody who dances like that
can't possibly be self-conscious.

1084
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,786
Just completely uninhibited.

1085
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,205
I've never seen a man
dance like that before. . .

1086
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:47,415
without him being a woman.

1087
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,499
This is not gonna help.

1088
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,917
All right, maybe not right
for the vows.

1089
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,586
I'm just trying to be objective here.

1090
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:54,631
And, I mean, honestly,
as far as being safe and secure, look.

1091
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,966
How can you not feel safe and secure
with a guy like that?

1092
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,760
I mean, he's probably
the only man in history

1093
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,053
to wear a turtleneck in Africa.

1094
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,095
I like it.

1095
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,973
Oh, it's too hot in here for this.

1096
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:06,309
And as far as being strong-willed
goes, that's great for you,

1097
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:09,437
because you could just turn off
for the next 50 years,

1098
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:12,065
like a little robot --
be taken care of.

1099
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:14,192
Isn't that what you want?

1100
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,028
Now you're just being an ass, Sam.

1101
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,281
Yes, I am.

1102
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:23,076
I'm winning you back, goddamn it.

1103
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:28,206
I missed you.

1104
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,540
I know.

1105
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:33,044
That's why I came.
I could feel it.

1106
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,340
Just shut up.

1107
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:47,433
Yeah, you know,
if you could just be gone

1108
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,477
in the morning before I wake up,

1109
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,396
that would make things
so much easier for me.

1110
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,275
Well, who said I was trying
to make things easy for you?

1111
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,819
You never stop talking, do you?

1112
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,028
No, I don't.

1115
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:08,454

1122
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:31,853
You looked so peaceful,
I was gonna let you sleep more.

1123
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,480
Boy.

1124
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,482
We had a crazy night,
didn't we, old sport?

1125
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,776
Well, what happened
with Zoe last night?

1126
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:39,652
What about it?

1127
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,571
I mean, why was she in your room

1128
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,906
instead of
with her soon-to-be husband?

1129
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,117
You want to know the truth,
Marshall?

1130
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,577
Yeah. I want to know the truth.

1131
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:48,661
To make a long story short,

1132
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:51,789
she's not sure she wants
to marry this asshole after all.

1133
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:52,832
Seriously?

1134
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:53,583
Seriously.

1135
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:54,751
She's saying she's thinking

1136
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,377
about calling off
the whole frickin' wedding.

1137
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:59,046
God, she's a very
complicated woman, Marshall.

1138
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,132
Yeah, it seems that way.

1139
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,842
Buddy, I know this is
the last thing you need.

1140
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,386
I would not have ever come
down here in the first place

1141
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,889
if I knew she was gonna go nuts
on me like this.

1142
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:10,141
That's okay.
At least we can leave now, right?

1143
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,268
I can't.

1144
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:13,352
Why not?

1145
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,520
Because I have to stay here

1146
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:16,230
until she figures
this whole thing out.

1147
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:17,899
I'm all she has.
She's all alone in the world.

1148
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,901
You know, who's she gonna
talk to -- Uncle Teddy?

1149
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,861
ln the meantime, why don't you
go take a power nap?

1150
00:46:21,987 --> 00:46:23,905
I'll go downstairs and have them
whip you up some eggs.

1151
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,782
Still like your yolks cut out?

1152
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:30,161
You look like a little prince
right now, by the way.

1153
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,580

00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,472

1161
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,850
Um. . . one minute.

Morning, gang!
Is this the cool section?

1171
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:17,875
Hi. Is it morning already?

1172
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:20,419
Wow.
It just sneaks up on you.

1173
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:22,046
You sleep at all, pal?

1174
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:23,589
Perfect amount.
How about you?

1175
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:25,299
No, not one bit.

1176
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:27,093
I've been working on this all night.

1177
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:27,969
Check it out.

1178
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,595
It's a cock.

1179
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:32,223
I know, Teddy.

1180
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:35,309
How exactly do you know
this Sam character, anyway?

1181
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:37,061
It all seems a bit mysterious.

1182
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:38,980
I-I was in New York.
I bumped into him.

1183
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,439
He's a writer.

1184
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:43,860
He sends me his stories, and. . .
I give him notes.

1185
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,194
Gives me something to do.

1186
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,779
You totally fucked him, didn't you?

1187
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:48,239
He's a bit young, dear.

1188
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,950
No. No, we're friends.
We're pen pals.

1189
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:53,578
If you want to know how the sex is,
I think you got to ask Margaret.

1190
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:54,328
Hmm?

1191
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:55,329
-Shut up.
-What?

1192
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,456
You complete old slag!

1193
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:00,334
Well, come on, then, tell us.
Was he any good?

1194
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,087
Well, if -- if holding him
while he wept

1195
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:06,340
because some girl
broke his heart is good, then, um. . .

1196
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:08,467
yeah, it was great.

1197
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,552
Best I've ever had.

1199
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:11,971
Wow.

1200
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:16,350
Yeah, he's, um --
he's an intense young man.

1201
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:17,435
Very emotional.

1202
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,395
-Hi, girls. Good morning.
-Good morning.

1203
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:20,688
-Morning.
-Still here, are we?

1204
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,982
Good morning.
I made you a little present.

1205
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,151
Here. If I would've known
you were getting married,

1206
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:27,528
I would've gotten you something
like a blender or a set of knives,

1207
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:28,362
but that'll do.

1208
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:31,115
Look, Zo, it's got your name on it.

1209
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,992
Yeah, it does.

1210
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:33,993
Thank you.

1211
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:35,578
-Hey, there.
-Hmm?

1212
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,038
We had a fun night last night,
didn't we?

1213
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:39,040
We did.
How are you feeling?

1214
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:40,416
Better, thanks.

1215
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:42,877
Seriously, who are you,
and why are you here?

1216
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,003
Wouldn't you like to know?

1217
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:47,465
Enjoying your breakfast,
you snakes in the grass?

1218
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,300
If you're gonna film me
waking up in the morning,

1219
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:50,384
you should wake up before me.

1220
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:51,427
It's not brain science.

1221
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:53,346
Discuss it with Spider.
I'm done.

1222
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:55,348
God, look at this table
of gorgeous ladies.

1223
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,600
-Morning, darling.
-Lady of the house.

1224
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:59,143
Big Sam.

1225
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,354
Hey, morning, Teddy.
You look rested.

1226
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,939
I made this
for your wedding.

1227
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,190
It's your portrait.

1228
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:06,817
It's a big skinny penis with balls.

1230
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,530
I spent a lot of time on it.

1231
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:12,782
Nice shorts, pal.

1232
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,575
-Oh, that's funny.
-Oh. . .

1233
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:16,744
I think he likes me.

1234
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,162
Finally.

1235
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,747
Where were you last night?

1236
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:21,707
Oh, I couldn't sleep.

1237
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:22,833
I worked on my vows.

1238
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,043
Come here.

1240
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,882
What is that hideous thing
around your neck?

1241
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:31,550
It's a wedding present from Sam.

1242
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,636
Look. Isn't that pretty?

1243
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:34,845
Yours is in the mail, slick.

1244
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:36,847
Sam.

1245
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,808
Why don't you come and take a ride
with me down the beach?

1246
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,143
Looks like Teddy blew off
all the fireworks last night,

1247
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:42,561
and we need some more
for the reception.

1248
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:45,231
Come on. It'll be fun.

1249
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:46,440
Okay.

1250
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:48,442
-Don't go.
-Yep.

1251
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:52,238
Have fun.

1254
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:41,787
Give it to me.
Right here, right here.

1257
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,301
Hi.

1259
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:06,312
You okay?

1261
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:09,940
Hey!

1262
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,529
You know, Zoe left one of your stories
lying around the house,

1263
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:17,073
and I finally had
a chance to read it --

1264
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,241
the one about the koala bear
in the Central Park Zoo.

1265
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:21,035
Really? Why would you do that?

1266
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:23,204
You know, Sam,
you're not half bad.

1267
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:26,082
Your writing has a lot of character.

1268
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:29,251
I will say, though, that
that adorable koala bear

1269
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:32,755
got kind of annoying,
with the whingeing and the moaning,

1270
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:35,633
and I'm not sure
it's a good story for children.

1271
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,343
Well, you're not exactly
my target demo,

1272
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:38,928
but I take that as a compliment.

1273
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:42,306
Are you as much a romantic
in your real life

1274
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,641
as you are in your work?

1275
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,311
I certainly try.

1276
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:50,773
I consider myself a realist,

1277
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:53,859
more concerned
with the human condition.

1278
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:56,695
I'm sure you can tell that
from my body of work. It's. . .

1279
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:59,532
It's a bit lbsenesque, I suppose.

1280
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:01,534
Anyway, I admire that quality
in your writing.

1281
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,245
Although I've never really
been much of a reader.

1282
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:06,205
All Zoe does is read.

1283
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:09,542
All day, all night, she'll read
anything you put in front of her.

1284
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,252
It's quite sweet, really.

1285
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,963
It's why -- it's why she likes
someone like you.

1286
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:18,592
Because I'm working
so much of the time,

1287
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:21,554
it's difficult for me
to cater to all of Zoe's. . .

1289
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:26,767
. . .interests.

1290
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:29,812
That's our Zoe, isn't it?
She's mad!

1291
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:33,566
She decides she wants
to learn tennis, she learns tennis!

1292
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,860
She goes to all the matches,

1293
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:39,029
practices every day,
she develops a nice backhand.

1294
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,699
Her goddamn instructor moved in
with us one summer.

1295
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:44,618
And then one day,
she decides tennis is a dull sport,

1296
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,287
a game for spoiled aristocrats,

1297
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:48,622
and she wants nothing more
to do with it.

1298
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:50,833
Last summer, it was dragonflies.

1299
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:53,043
She was obsessed with the things.

1300
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,255
Studied them, painted them,
took courses on them,

1301
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:59,175
and then one day, poof.

1302
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,135
No more dragonflies.

1303
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:04,763
Yeah, I didn't even know
she liked dragonflies.

1304
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,223
Well, she doesn't, Sam.

1305
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:10,144
Not anymore.

1306
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,188
It's okay, just hold still.

1308
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:17,067
All done.

1309
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:25,534
Sam tell you a lot about me?

1310
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:30,998
Well, I mean, Sam and l
are pretty much brothers, so. . .

1311
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,917
he tells me practically everything.

1313
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:36,545
I hope not.

1314
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:43,219
You know, I'm not sure
that Sam ever told me

1315
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:45,054
the whole story of how you two met.

1317
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,149
Uh, I was, um. . .

1318
00:53:57,275 --> 00:54:02,821
I was in New York with Whit,
the premiere of his film.

1319
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:06,784
I think it was
"A Tale of Two Villages."

1320
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:11,497
And we got into a terrible fight
at the Ziegfeld,

1321
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:15,542
and I stormed out of the theater
into the pouring rain.

1322
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:18,796
I was a mess.

1323
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:25,844
And suddenly the rain
stopped hitting me.

1324
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:30,015
I looked up. . .

1325
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:34,144
. . .and it was Sam,
without an umbrella. . .

1326
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,397
. . .holding a copy
of The New York Observer

1327
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:37,439
over my head.

1328
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:41,443
Guess it must have been
a Wednesday.

1329
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,821
I guess so.

1330
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:48,867
We spent the entire night together.

1331
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:53,038
When it came time
to say our good-byes. . .

1332
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:55,582
he asked me to be his pen pal.

1334
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:01,046
Sure enough, two weeks later,

1335
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:06,802
I receive this epic
1 0-page letter from Sam.

1336
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:15,019
And I made the mistake
of writing him back.

1337
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:22,693
Sorry.
What am I talking about?

1338
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,778
So, what was the plan?

1339
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:28,866
He was gonna. . .
come all the way out here

1340
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:32,036
and propose to me
in front of everyone?

1342
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:34,246
I-I don't know.

1344
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:37,875
That is so stupid.

1345
00:55:38,209 --> 00:55:40,544
I guess that's why
he brought the ring, right?

1347
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:48,218
He brought a ring?

1348
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:51,555
Zoe left me once.
Did you know that?

1349
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:56,560
No. I had no idea.

1350
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:59,355
Of course you didn't.
No one does.

1351
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,315
She's very good at keeping secrets,
isn't she?

1352
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,817
Yeah, apparently.

1353
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:05,110
Who was the guy?

1354
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:10,491
He was some songwriter.

1355
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:14,244
Played the tambourine or something.

1356
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:16,997
What did you do?

1357
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:20,084
I let her leave.

1358
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:29,927
Now, what would you have done, Sam,
if you were me?

1359
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:34,056
If I were you. . .

1360
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:37,059
. . .I'd have gone after her.

1361
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,104
I guess I just don't feel the need

1362
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,147
to chase girls
around the schoolyard anymore.

1363
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:43,982
She came back, didn't she?

1364
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:45,818
Of course she did.

1365
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:48,404
She always does.

1367
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:01,166
Well, do you want to get back
and get those fireworks, or. . .?

1368
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:04,002
Huh?
Oh, don't worry about that.

1369
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:07,172
I'll send an intern or something.

1370
00:57:07,298 --> 00:57:09,007
Tell me, Sam, have you
ever had a lime Rickey?

1373
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:36,702
All right, all right, line up,
you gorgeous people.

1374
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:39,496
Every year for my birthday,
we throw a paper chase.

1375
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:41,039
You all know the rules.

1376
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:42,499
First team to gather up

1377
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:45,961
as many little pieces of paper
as you can wins the race,

1378
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:47,337
and you get to kiss a pretty girl.

1379
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:49,214
And you all stand a chance
this year,

1380
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,132
'cause I pulled a hammy

1381
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:52,176
when I was chasing an impala
back in the bush.

1383
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,888
All right, may the best team win.

1384
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:58,557
You promised me we were leaving.
I already packed up the car.

1385
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:00,851
We are gonna leave,
just as soon as we win this race,

1386
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:01,894
or whatever the hell it is.

1387
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,729
Sam, I can't participate
in a three-legged race

1388
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:05,022
when my foot is like this.

1389
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:06,190
What happened to your foot?

1390
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:08,859
I stepped on a martini glass.

1391
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:10,110
Well, why would you do that?

1392
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:13,780
Conditions are rough this year,
but thanks for playing. It keeps it fun.

1393
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:16,200
All right, someone take this.

1394
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,911
All right, Zoe, let's get this going.

1398
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:37,387
We need to hit a rhythm, Marshall.

1399
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,431
I can't hit a rhythm
when my foot is bleeding, Sam.

1400
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:40,432
Come on, as many as you can.

1401
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,267
Here, put them all in the basket.

1402
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:44,269
Everything you get,
put in the basket.

1403
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:45,687
Come on, Marshall,
keep up with me.

1404
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:47,022
We got to beat Whit and his African.

1405
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:48,232
You all right, Sam?

1406
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,358
Doing great!

1407
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:51,610
Can't run with the big dogs
and piss with the puppies.

1408
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:52,986
It looks like we're doing all right.

1409
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:54,029
Come on, hurry up!

1411
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,282
I don't understand
the point of this game.

1412
00:58:57,408 --> 00:58:58,951
No, I don't either, dear.
Never mind, eh?

1413
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:00,202
Come on, Whit!

1414
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:04,039
Here we go, just get all
the little papers you can get.

1415
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:05,999
Thank you. If you could please
leave our area, Whit!

1416
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:07,209
Babe, I think I'm winning!

1417
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,753
This is the stupidest game
I've ever seen.

1418
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,339
Quit trying to be quick
when my foot is bleeding.

1419
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:14,091
This is our area right here.

1420
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:14,967
-Ow!
-Marshall!

1421
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:16,510
I don't even get what the point
of this game is!

1422
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,387
Marshall, I have no idea
what the point of the game is,

1423
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:20,806
but I think we're in the lead
by half a basket.

1424
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:22,766
-You're a liar.
-Oh, Marshall, pick up your skirt.

1425
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:25,435
-Wait, what?
-You're a liar. You lied to me.

1426
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:26,270
About what?

1427
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,604
The only reason
we went on this vacation

1428
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,314
is 'cause you're completely
in love with that lady.

1429
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,524
-Admit it!
-Marshall, shh!

1430
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,067
-Zoe told me everything herself.
-Shh, shh!

1431
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:33,652
-You lied to her about the postcard.
-Okay, okay.

1432
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:35,320
And you lied to me
about wanting to be a good friend.

1433
00:59:35,446 --> 00:59:36,863
Marshall, okay, I understand
how this may seem,

1434
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,699
and you're right, I haven't been
completely honest with you,

1435
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,492
but you got to understand,
it's very complicated right now.

1436
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:42,786
Whit -- Whit just told me
that Zoe left him once.

1437
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:44,621
She left him once,
and she'll leave him again, okay?

1438
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:46,081
The man is threatened by me,
I can tell.

1439
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:47,749
Look at him,
he's practically running scared.

1440
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:50,085
I love this game! I'm a machine!

1442
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:56,425
Marshall, this man
is playing mind games with me.

1443
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:58,885
I am at war with this man
right now, okay?

1444
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,637
You cannot let him tear us apart.

1445
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:01,847
We are on the same team, pal.

1446
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:04,182
No, we're not.
We were never on the same team.

1447
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:06,184
You just gaslighted me
because you knew

1448
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,020
that no one else
would ever be a part of this.

1449
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,438
-Shh!
-And because I have a car.

1450
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:11,189
And now I have
a martini glass in my foot,

1451
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:12,441
and you have yet to apologize!

1452
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,818
Marshall, Jesus Christ,
what are you doing with your knife?

1453
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:16,320
Marshall, don't quit.

1454
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:18,363
Marshall, that's your birthday present.
What are you doing?

1455
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:20,157
No, it's not.
It's Noah Bressman's.

1456
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:23,702
Okay, pal.

1457
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:26,371
Don't worry, I'm gonna win
this goddamn race for you, okay?

1458
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:29,082
Take care of that foot.
I'll meet you back later.

1459
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:30,584
I'm getting my shoes back, okay?

1461
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:35,005
Oh, God, yeah,
look at all this.

1462
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:39,343
♪ It don't come easy ♪

1463
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:42,387
Come on, Sam, you can't play alone!

Hi, Marshmallow.

1476
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,170
Your foot is bleeding.

1477
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:17,589
Yeah. Um, do you know
where Teddy is?

1478
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:19,174
I need to find him
so I can get my shoes.

1479
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:20,717
Oh, well, you can sit here with us.

1480
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:22,928
We're just -- we're putting shells
in the colander.

1481
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:24,930
No, that's okay,
I think I'd like to find Teddy

1482
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:27,182
so I can get my shoes
and get out of here.

1483
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:31,436
Okay, well, he was right over there.
He went to go find dolphins.

1484
01:01:31,562 --> 01:01:33,271
Okay, uh. . .

1485
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,107
I don't see him anywhere.

1486
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:36,608
You sure you don't want to help?

1487
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:38,568

01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:26,491
Help!

1505
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:27,492
Teddy!

1506
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:30,662
All right, Marshall, stand aside!
We've got it!

1507
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:33,248
Teddy!

1508
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:34,249
Help him! Help him!

1509
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:36,293
-Get him up! Get him up!
-He's not breathing!

1510
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:37,461
Give him some space! Back off!

1511
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:39,045
I saved him. I saved his life.

1512
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:41,089
-What are you staring at?!
-Breathe for me, Teddy.

1513
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:42,174
Call an ambulance!

1514
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,300
Teddy!

1515
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:45,552
-Come on, Teddy, please!
-One, two, three, four.

1516
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,179
Teddy! Come on, Teddy!

1517
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:50,140
Teddy, please!
Please, Teddy!

1518
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:51,141
Not today.

1519
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:52,476
-Come on, Teddy, come on.
-Teddy!

1521
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:56,938
Yeah, mate, get it all out.
Spit it up, spit it up.

1523
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:59,649
That's it, that's it.
Turn him over.

1524
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,067
Teddy!

1525
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:03,236
All right, everyone,
he's all right, he's all right.

1526
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:04,863
Did I go under?

1527
01:03:04,989 --> 01:03:07,866
That's our man.
He's all right.

1528
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:09,659
Yes! Yes!

1529
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:11,119
You can't do that!

1530
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:12,746
-Let's go, eh?
-I'm okay.

1532
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,333
Come on, love,
let me take care of him.

1533
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:18,877
-All right, let's go.
-God damn you, Teddy!

1534
01:03:19,003 --> 01:03:19,711
Up, up, up, up, up.

1535
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:22,005
I did it, everybody! I did it!

1536
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:25,217
I'm alive!

1537
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:27,636
Thank you all for your help.
You've all been real stars.

1538
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:30,055
Drama's over.

1539
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:31,723
Are you okay?

1540
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:34,017
Stop it, Sam!

1541
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:34,935
Are you mad at me?

1542
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:37,687
It's not about you, Sam.

1543
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,824
It's all right. It's all right.

1545
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:53,912
It's gonna be all right.
Come on, love.

1546
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:54,788
Come on, my love.

1547
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:56,873
I'm sorry.

1548
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:58,917
It's all right.

1549
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:01,419
You have nothing to be sorry about.

1550
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:03,547
I'm sorry.

1551
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,173
It's all right.

1553
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:14,599
No, no, no, Marshall, you can't leave!
I need you here!

1554
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:16,226
I am going home.

1555
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:18,478
These people --
these are bad people, Sam.

1556
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:21,356
They're irresponsible. They're like --
they're like babies with money.

1557
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:22,357
Marshall, I apologize

1558
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:24,234
that I made you do the paper chase
with your bad foot,

1559
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,111
but I honestly thought we had
a shot at winning the thing.

1560
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:28,738
We never had a shot, Sam,
and I-I can't just stand by

1561
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:30,365
and watch you do this
to yourself anymore.

1562
01:04:30,491 --> 01:04:31,950
I'm not gonna be
a supporting character

1563
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:33,285
in your pathetic little story.

1564
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:35,912
It's unoriginal.
You are not Holden Crawford.

1565
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:37,747
All right, first of all, it's Holden --

1566
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:40,792
Marshall, please, don't use
metaphors with me right now.

1567
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:41,585
Please, okay?

1569
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:44,754
You -- you are a bad man.

1570
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,464
You are. You're a bad person.

1571
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,758
You came here to ruin
a poor woman's marriage,

1572
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,635
and you preyed upon a broken man

1573
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:52,262
and your former best friend
in the process.

1574
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:53,305
Oh, my God, Marshall!

1575
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,056
And you had no right to do that!
You had no right!

1576
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:57,309
Marshall, shut up! Shut up!

1577
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:59,769
I am sick and tired of hearing
about your misfortune.

1578
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,147
And the way you decide
to divulge this information

1579
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:04,774
to anybody who's willing to listen --
it's depressing.

1580
01:05:04,942 --> 01:05:06,276
What is that supposed to mean?

1581
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:09,529
Marshall, you got
pistol-whipped. . . once.

1582
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:11,781
I'm sorry it happened,
and it's a shame,

1583
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:13,825
but it happens
to somebody new every day,

1584
01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:15,410
and they move on with their lives.

1585
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:16,912
You complain!

1586
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:18,622
I was assaulted!

1587
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,707
A man came at me from behind
with a gun

1588
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:23,126
and beat me,
and then stole all of my money!

1589
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:25,003
That's what I mean --
it's always a new excuse

1590
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:27,505
to not move out of your parents' house,
to not get a new job.

1591
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:30,467
Marshall, don't you realize
you should be thanking me right now?

1592
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:33,094
I took you on an adventure.

1593
01:05:33,721 --> 01:05:35,472
Do you think that these people
care about you?

1594
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:37,140
I don't care.

1595
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:38,600
You have nothing
to offer them, Sam!

1596
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:39,976
You're just a mistress!

1597
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:42,395
And if you had just come to me
and told me your feelings,

1598
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:43,563
I would've listened to you,

1599
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:45,357
and I would've told you
you were a fool.

1600
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:48,318
But, instead, you decided
to use and to lie to me.

1601
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:50,070
And that's just sick and disgusting!

1602
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:52,113
I'm your best friend!

1603
01:05:54,158 --> 01:05:56,534
Oh. And this, Sam.

1604
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:59,037
You think this is really
gonna impress her?

1605
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:00,205
Give that back.

1606
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:04,542
You're young, you're poor,
and, honestly, you're a shitty writer.

1607
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:07,128
Yeah?

1610
01:06:11,175 --> 01:06:13,134
I used to look up to you.

1611
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:16,012
Marshall, you're a year and a half
older than me.

1612
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:18,181
Shut up.

1614
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:02,267
My God, Sam,
what happened to your face?

1615
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:06,062
I fell down the stairs.

1616
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:10,734
We should have the paramedics
take a look at you if they're still here.

1617
01:07:12,486 --> 01:07:14,154
Your nose looks crooked.

1618
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:18,324
No, it's fine.
It's always been like that.

1619
01:07:18,492 --> 01:07:19,701
All right, come on.

1621
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:22,579
-All right.
-Thanks.

1622
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:25,123
So the gents are off
to the woods for the night.

1623
01:07:25,249 --> 01:07:27,584
It's a 200-year-old tradition
for the men in my family

1624
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:29,544
to sleep under the stars
before a wedding.

1625
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:30,670
-Oh.
-You should come.

1626
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:32,422
Oh, no.
That -- that sounds great, Whit.

1627
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:34,758
I think I'm just gonna stay here
and hold down the fort.

1628
01:07:34,925 --> 01:07:36,468
Come on.
I'll let you shoot my gun.

1629
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:38,386
Yeah, I'd love to shoot your gun,
trust me,

1630
01:07:38,512 --> 01:07:41,431
but I'm just gonna keep it close,
battle the elements here.

1631
01:07:41,932 --> 01:07:44,976
So Big Sam has bravely
offered to stay back

1632
01:07:45,102 --> 01:07:47,103
and look after our women.

1633
01:07:47,271 --> 01:07:48,605
Let's go, men.

1634
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:52,192
♪ Up spoke the captain
of our gallant ship ♪

1635
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:54,527
♪ And a fine old man was he ♪

1636
01:07:54,653 --> 01:07:56,821
I'm pretty sure he doesn't
even think you're that funny,

1637
01:07:56,947 --> 01:07:59,949
which I happen to find to be
one of your best qualities.

1638
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:03,536
The man also admitted to me
out loud that he hates reading.

1639
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:06,331
And I know you think
I'm young and irrational,

1640
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:07,415
and I am in some ways,

1641
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:10,835
but at least I appreciate you
for your best qualities.

1642
01:08:10,961 --> 01:08:13,004
You know, I-I made
some terrible mistakes,

1643
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:15,006
and I probably alienated

1644
01:08:15,132 --> 01:08:16,841
the majority of people
who were close to me,

1645
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:19,385
but I did that because I love you.

1646
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:23,139
And that's what love is, isn't it?

1647
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:27,519
You could just give me a chance.

1648
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:31,272
At least where we could live together
for an extended period of time,

1649
01:08:31,398 --> 01:08:33,900
where I could make some money
and buy you things,

1650
01:08:34,026 --> 01:08:36,986
and we could
develop hobbies together.

1651
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:40,323
I could very easily spend
the rest of my life with you.

1652
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:42,992
And I know you feel the same way.

1653
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,702
I could be the father
of your children.

1654
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:46,329
I should be the father
of your children.

1655
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:48,373
There should be half of me
in your children.

1656
01:08:48,499 --> 01:08:50,333
Who are you talking to, Sam?

1657
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,461
It's 6:00 in the morning.

1658
01:08:53,587 --> 01:08:55,797
Oh.

1659
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:58,341
I was talking to you.

1660
01:08:58,676 --> 01:09:00,510
How long were you, uh. . .?

1661
01:09:03,597 --> 01:09:05,598
You want to go for a walk?

1662
01:09:07,476 --> 01:09:09,894
You want to marry me?

1663
01:09:13,357 --> 01:09:15,358
I never had a chance
to thank Marshall

1664
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:17,360
for saving Teddy's life.

1665
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:19,737
Will you tell him for me
when you see him?

1666
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:24,367
I don't think we'll be seeing
each other for quite a while.

1667
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:26,161
Did I cause all this?

1668
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:27,120
No.

1669
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:29,205
I mean, yes.

1670
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:32,417
Technically, it is your fault.

1671
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:36,212
But I think I'm mostly to blame,
you know.

1672
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:45,305
I'm sorry I snapped at you
earlier on the beach.

1673
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:48,349
I was just a little emotional.

1674
01:09:48,475 --> 01:09:53,188
I'm sorry for being so insensitive
about your brother almost dying.

1675
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:57,650
Did you and Whit
have a nice buggy ride?

1676
01:09:57,776 --> 01:09:59,485
Whit told me you used
to like dragonflies.

1677
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:02,864
I never knew that about you.

1678
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:05,116
I loved them.

1679
01:10:05,242 --> 01:10:07,452
That was just a phase.

1680
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:10,455
Everyone has phases.

1681
01:10:11,415 --> 01:10:13,291
I don't.

1682
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:14,876
When I love something,
I stick with it.

1683
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:17,295
-I'm a very convicted person.
-Hmm.

1684
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:21,799
I don't just throw things away
whenever I lose interest.

1685
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:24,761
That's a very admirable trait, Sam.

1686
01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:34,479
You know, you don't have
to marry this guy, Zoe.

1687
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:37,232
I'm too tall for you, Sam.

1688
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:40,818
I'm serious.
Don't put yourself through this.

1689
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:44,113
You don't understand.
I don't -- I want to.

1690
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:46,074
I don't believe you.

1691
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,742
If you wanted to,
you would've done it already.

1692
01:10:47,868 --> 01:10:49,494
-There's a very good --
-I'm asking you --

1693
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:50,954
You haven't even written
your vows yet.

1694
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,498
Please, don't make this harder
than it already is!

1695
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:55,333
Wh-why do you want
to marry Whit?

1696
01:10:55,459 --> 01:10:58,253
Give me one good reason --
I'll leave.

1697
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:00,505
It's not that easy.

1698
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:01,923
Well, it should be!

1699
01:11:02,132 --> 01:11:04,467
You used to tell me you didn't
even believe in marriage.

1700
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:06,803
Things change.
People grow up.

1701
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:09,555
-I've grown up.
-Oh, you've grown up?

1702
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:11,766
Sneaking into my room
in the middle of the night barefoot?

1703
01:11:11,892 --> 01:11:12,850
You -- go ahead.

1704
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:15,186
I'm gonna ruin your wedding
in front of everyone, that's it.

1705
01:11:15,312 --> 01:11:16,229
How are you gonna do that?

1706
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:18,690
I will tell Whit
every single thing about us

1707
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:20,233
from the night in the rain until the --

1708
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:21,818
Whit knows.

1709
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:25,196
What does that mean?

1710
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:29,158
Whit knows.
He's always known.

1711
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,411
H-how?

1712
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:33,997
Because he's not an idiot.

1713
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:37,083
I don't -- I don't --
I don't understand.

1714
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:40,295
Why. . . why would he
let me stay here?

1715
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:44,340
Because he loves me.

1716
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:48,011
He trusts me.

1717
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:53,933
Because you're not
a real threat, Sam.

1718
01:11:56,353 --> 01:11:58,855
I am in love with you,
and you love me!

1719
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:00,064
And that's it! This is love!

1720
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:03,776
That's not love! That is bullshit!

1721
01:12:03,902 --> 01:12:06,279
Right?

1722
01:12:09,783 --> 01:12:14,329
Answer me.

1723
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:18,374
Are you in love with me,
or am I just dragonflies?

1724
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:29,761
So that's it, then?
I'm just a phase?

1725
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:31,304
I know all
about your tambourine player.

1726
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:32,597
So you just love everyone, huh?

1727
01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:35,099
You just flit around and love
everything without consequence?

1728
01:12:35,225 --> 01:12:37,769
Wow, that's a big problem, Zoe!
And Whit lets you get away with it?

1729
01:12:37,936 --> 01:12:40,271
Shut up! Shut up!

1731
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:44,650
How did you see this ending?

1732
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:47,487
Quick, Sam.
Tell me your amazing plan.

1733
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:49,113
What's our move?

1734
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:50,823
Should I go upstairs
and pack a suitcase,

1735
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:53,284
jump into your friend's station wagon
and run away with you

1736
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:54,911
to a one-bedroom apartment?

1737
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:57,622
I'm sure you can provide
for the little ones and me

1738
01:12:57,790 --> 01:12:59,165
with all the money you've made

1739
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:01,959
from your wildly successful
children's stories.

1740
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:05,296
Better yet, why don't we hop
on a whale together

1741
01:13:05,422 --> 01:13:08,424
and go live under the sea?

1743
01:13:12,262 --> 01:13:16,599
I can see you really
thought this through.

1744
01:13:20,604 --> 01:13:24,732
I can't be your mermaid, Sam.

1745
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:29,153
I'm too selfish.

1746
01:13:33,033 --> 01:13:34,617
You mean "shellfish"?

1749
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:43,543
You're just a child.

1751
01:14:12,823 --> 01:14:14,824
Really, really cool.
Oh, my God.

1752
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:18,995
Film that. Right there.
The saddest boy alive.

1754
01:14:28,338 --> 01:14:29,755
Sammy.

1755
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:30,715
Teddy.

1757
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:34,051
You're here.

1758
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:35,386
I'm here.

1760
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:37,680
That would have been bad.

1762
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:42,393
No, but I'm feeling a lot better, man.

1763
01:14:42,519 --> 01:14:44,729
The doctor said,
you know, stay hydrated,

1764
01:14:44,855 --> 01:14:47,356
so that's what I plan on doing.

1765
01:14:48,358 --> 01:14:49,358
Cheers.

1766
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:51,360
How you doing?

1767
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:53,821
It's the lowest point
of my life, actually.

1768
01:14:53,947 --> 01:14:56,532
Oh, come on, pal.
It ain't that bad.

1769
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:57,909
No, it's pretty bad.

1770
01:14:58,035 --> 01:14:59,702
Look, Sammy.

1771
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:02,413
I know it's hard, but, you know,
from what I've heard,

1772
01:15:02,539 --> 01:15:05,041
it's important to have perspective
in these moments

1773
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:08,127
and just let it go, man.

1774
01:15:08,253 --> 01:15:11,255
Just let it. . .
You know?

1775
01:15:11,381 --> 01:15:14,759
You know, it's -- it's easier said
than done, though.

1776
01:15:14,885 --> 01:15:17,762
Yeah, that's -- hey.

1777
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:19,514
Look, pally, how old are you?

1778
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:20,806
I'm 23 and a half.

1779
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:22,517
23? Just a baby.

1780
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:23,893
Look at it like this.

1781
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:26,771
ln a couple years,
that old sun's gonna burn out,

1782
01:15:26,897 --> 01:15:28,814
and we're all gonna be dead.

1783
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:32,527
And you're gonna be what, 27?

1785
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:34,487
Right?

1786
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:36,697
Now what, man?

1787
01:15:36,823 --> 01:15:39,116
Teddy, you're being
very profound right now.

1788
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:41,369
Well, I'm sober.

1789
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:42,703
You have a beer in your hand.

1790
01:15:42,829 --> 01:15:44,205
Come on.

1791
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:50,503
Give these to Marshall.

1792
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:54,382
Tell that boy thanks
for saving my life, all right?

1793
01:15:55,842 --> 01:15:57,843
He has such little feet.

1794
01:15:57,970 --> 01:16:00,388
Yeah, but he's strong.

1795
01:16:01,181 --> 01:16:03,057
All right, Teddy, I'll see ya.

1796
01:16:03,183 --> 01:16:04,642
Yeah, I'll see you, too.

1798
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:08,729
Hey, Sammy.

1799
01:16:08,855 --> 01:16:11,732
Let's end this right, pal.

1800
01:16:11,858 --> 01:16:13,651
All right?

1801
01:16:13,777 --> 01:16:15,820
Come on, man.

1802
01:16:15,946 --> 01:16:18,531
The good guys sometimes win.

1803
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:20,366
I don't know how good I am, Teddy.

1804
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:23,327
Yeah, but you're young.

1806
01:16:25,289 --> 01:16:26,706
And you're good, pally.

1808
01:16:33,797 --> 01:16:35,464
Actually, I really needed that.

1809
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:37,717

1811
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:50,646

Hi. Uh, my name is Marshall.
We met in the closet earlier.

1845
01:18:56,106 --> 01:18:57,773
We've been making eye contact
all weekend.

1846
01:18:57,899 --> 01:18:59,483
You have a ladybug in your hair.

1847
01:18:59,609 --> 01:19:01,068
Um, anyway, I was just. . .

1851
01:19:35,145 --> 01:19:37,980
Uh, thanks.

1852
01:19:40,025 --> 01:19:42,818
What happened back there?

1853
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:47,281
I, um. . . asked the sad maid
for her phone number.

1854
01:19:47,407 --> 01:19:48,866
Did you really?

1855
01:19:48,992 --> 01:19:50,951
What did she say?

1856
01:19:51,077 --> 01:19:53,704
No.

1857
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:56,040
It's her loss.

1858
01:19:56,166 --> 01:19:59,752
You find out
why she's so sad all the time?

1859
01:19:59,878 --> 01:20:05,049
No. She, uh. . . she didn't
speak English very well.

1860
01:20:05,175 --> 01:20:08,677

She's a real Éponine, isn't she?

1861
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:12,431
Hey. . .

1862
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:16,101
Look at me, buddy.

1863
01:20:18,438 --> 01:20:23,108
I'm really sorry that I haven't
called you back in a year.

1864
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:26,987
I've been a bit
of an absentee best friend.

1865
01:20:27,113 --> 01:20:29,365
You're an asshole, Sam.

1866
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:31,659
I know.

1867
01:20:31,785 --> 01:20:35,246
You've been a terrible
and a cruel friend to me.

1868
01:20:35,372 --> 01:20:38,082
And you said things
over these past few days

1869
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:39,750
that I don't think
you can ever take back.

1870
01:20:39,876 --> 01:20:41,919
I know that.

1872
01:20:45,924 --> 01:20:48,592
And you've taken
a lot of my money.

1873
01:20:48,718 --> 01:20:51,053
Marshall. . .

1874
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:54,557
I know.

1875
01:20:55,809 --> 01:20:58,602
And I'm sorry.

1876
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:05,067
Just. . .

1877
01:21:08,488 --> 01:21:12,825
I don't think I've been
completely honest with myself.

1878
01:21:18,748 --> 01:21:23,127
I'm just a. . . joke.

1880
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:34,096
I think I'd like to start seeing
your therapist maybe.

1881
01:21:36,933 --> 01:21:40,311
I think that'd be a really good idea.

1883
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:44,273
By the way,
your hair looks fantastic.

1884
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:45,608
Thank you.

1885
01:21:51,656 --> 01:21:55,993
So, uh, how'd it go with Zoe?

1886
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:59,580
Oh, I ruined her wedding.

1887
01:22:02,792 --> 01:22:04,835
You've written vows?

1888
01:22:04,961 --> 01:22:06,962

1889
01:22:07,297 --> 01:22:09,715
