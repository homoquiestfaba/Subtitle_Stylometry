1
00:00:27,174 --> 00:00:29,660
(birds chirping)

2
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,770
- I feel as if I don't have any control

3
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,440
of anything that's going on.

4
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,583
Sometimes I can be really
happy and sometimes

5
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:41,480
I can just feel like everything's

6
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,580
crashing down on me and that

7
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,120
people are really mean to me

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,550
and I don't know how to deal with it.

9
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,273
I feel really weak sometimes.

10
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,800
Like right now,

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,290
the only other time I felt like this

12
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,260
is when you stopped breastfeeding

13
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,790
when you were eight months old

14
00:01:01,682 --> 00:01:04,630
and I didn't know what
my purpose was anymore

15
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:07,300
because you didn't want me to feed you

16
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,060
and then your father
started running around

17
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,680
and he left and I didn't know

18
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,723
what I was supposed to do with my life.

19
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,677
I felt like nobody loved me

20
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:18,844
and I had to figure out

21
00:01:18,844 --> 00:01:21,263
what I was doing in my life.

22
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,163
- What is your emotional
life like right now inside?

23
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,930
- I feel as if I don't have any control

24
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,873
of anything that's going on.

25
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,503
- Mommy, look into the camera.

26
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,163
- And I can't contain it.

27
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,873
That's why I'm leaving Mack.

28
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,364
- Aunt Rita?

29
00:01:46,364 --> 00:01:50,140
- I, I tell myself that
it's body chemistry

30
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,510
and this is just a chemical thing

31
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:57,130
but it's very, very real.

32
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,560
- Aunt Lulu.

33
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,610
- I think about death 24 hours a day.

34
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm completely obsessed with death.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,975
- You go to doctors and
you try to figure out

36
00:02:03,975 --> 00:02:05,760
what the best thing is.

37
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,820
- I want to kill everybody at all times.

38
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,560
- I know that I've got to get blood tests

39
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,790
to find out what my hormone levels are.

40
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,623
- Supplements.

41
00:02:12,623 --> 00:02:14,924
- Some other being inhabits me sometimes

42
00:02:14,924 --> 00:02:17,360
and I just get, like, wacky.

43
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,480
- Suddenly the legs have to be open

44
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,427
and nothing can have
contact with each other

45
00:02:21,427 --> 00:02:22,939
and the hair has to be up and I'm panting,

46
00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:24,891
literally sticking my tongue
out, panting like a dog,

47
00:02:24,891 --> 00:02:26,220
go like. (panting)

48
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,490
- Trying to figure out how

49
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,630
to balance this chemistry.

50
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,004
- And then take medicine and creams

51
00:02:31,004 --> 00:02:32,510
and all that kind of stuff.

52
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,940
- We each have a coping,
so my mine is humor.

53
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,977
- My husband brings me a
cup of coffee and says,

54
00:02:36,977 --> 00:02:38,427
"Good morning, sweetheart,"

55
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,340
and I wanna kill him.

56
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,710
- I used to rollerblade in
my bikini on Venice Beach.

57
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,543
Remember?

58
00:02:45,543 --> 00:02:49,440
- I wanna kill him in
really creative and painful

59
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,708
and specific ways.

60
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:52,958
(laughing)

61
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,263
And then I wanna have sex.

62
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:03,109
(dramatic music)

63
00:03:09,424 --> 00:03:10,257
- Good evening, folks,

64
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:12,650
welcome to "Mack Riley's Extreme Sports."

65
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,931
Now, as everyone who loves surfing knows,

66
00:03:14,931 --> 00:03:17,400
Mother Nature's giving
southern California surfers

67
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,160
a real Thanksgiving treat this week

68
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,775
as huge waves are hitting
the California coastline.

69
00:03:21,775 --> 00:03:23,699
This is the same swell
that's been pounding Hawaii

70
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:24,795
for the last week,

71
00:03:24,795 --> 00:03:26,230
actually more specifically,

72
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,776
it's been hitting Oahu, the North Shore,

73
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:31,980
where the Haleiwa Surfing
Championship is taking place,

74
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,494
the first leg of the Hawaiian
Triple Crown of surfing,

75
00:03:34,494 --> 00:03:37,000
some of the biggest waves ever ridden.

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,720
Those waves are finally here,

77
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,704
and all of you big-wave surfers,

78
00:03:40,704 --> 00:03:43,100
it's time to wax up your
big guns and paddle out.

79
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,530
I'll probably be out there with you.

80
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,117
At the same time, the
local mountain ranges

81
00:03:46,117 --> 00:03:48,790
are starting to look pretty
good to skiers and snowboarders,

82
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,043
so this may be an opportunity for you

83
00:03:50,043 --> 00:03:53,809
to do what I like to call
a boarder's double dip,

84
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:55,191
where you surf in the morning,

85
00:03:55,191 --> 00:03:57,223
you ski in the afternoon.

86
00:03:57,223 --> 00:04:01,794
- It's okay, just feel
your feelings, just.

87
00:04:01,794 --> 00:04:02,987
(inhaling)

88
00:04:02,987 --> 00:04:04,654
We all feel jealous.

89
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,120
- It's one of those advantages of living

90
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,943
in southern California,
where you have the.

91
00:04:08,943 --> 00:04:11,819
- Just because we don't feel
that we're enough inside

92
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:15,580
and we just have to
learn that we are enough.

93
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,153
- 365 days a year, I haven't
done that in a few years

94
00:04:18,153 --> 00:04:20,627
but this is an opportunity
to give it a go.

95
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:23,377
(dramatic music)

96
00:04:24,603 --> 00:04:25,973
- Another great day, guys.

97
00:04:25,973 --> 00:04:28,030
Another good show in the can, Mack.

98
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,210
Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

99
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,951
- Thanks for taking your
time to come in here.

100
00:04:30,951 --> 00:04:33,500
I wanna share a little something with you.

101
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,720
I'd like to get some feedback.

102
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,630
Angela here came to me earlier today

103
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,880
and shared some information.

104
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,492
I didn't want you to hear
it through the grapevine,

105
00:04:41,492 --> 00:04:46,492
so you're gonna get it
straight from he horse's mouth.

106
00:04:46,504 --> 00:04:47,450
- What's going on?
- I know I'm still new.

107
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,350
I don't want to start anything

108
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,830
but I got a phone call
today from my friend

109
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,250
that said there's a rumor

110
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,331
that people are coming
here from headquarters.

111
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:58,560
- From New York?

112
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,500
- Right.

113
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,140
- That's all I got, that's all I got.

114
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,170
- It's a periodic evaluation, I'm sure.

115
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,110
- We gotta prepare.
- Well, right, we gotta--

116
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,569
- Is there anything
that I should know about

117
00:05:07,569 --> 00:05:09,420
in each one of your departments,

118
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,119
in each one of your situations--

119
00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:12,250
- Everything's fine.
- In your lives.

120
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,400
- Everything's copacetic.
- You know, I've been

121
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,500
to some affiliates where there's, like,

122
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,991
things going on where things are hidden,

123
00:05:17,991 --> 00:05:19,510
I'm just saying.

124
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,548
- Yeah, that's not the
kind of place we're running

125
00:05:20,548 --> 00:05:21,747
so we're just gonna have a discussion--

126
00:05:21,747 --> 00:05:22,580
- Look, I didn't wanna
make anybody paranoid

127
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,132
but it just doesn't sound good,

128
00:05:24,132 --> 00:05:24,970
it doesn't feel good.

129
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,950
- Angela, is there something
else you wanna tell us?

130
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,102
- The rumor was that
they are coming tomorrow.

131
00:05:30,102 --> 00:05:32,416
- Tomorrow?
- And what do we do

132
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:33,270
tomorrow that's--

133
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,650
- You know, this is enough for me.

134
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,382
I got enough shit going on in my life.

135
00:05:37,382 --> 00:05:38,613
- What's going on?

136
00:05:38,613 --> 00:05:40,466
- I don't need to--
- What's going on?

137
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:42,470
- What's the problem, Mack?

138
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:47,410
- Oh, um, Carson and I got in
a little blowout last night

139
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,420
and she, she left me.

140
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,253
- What?

141
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,950
- Mom, why have you come to stay with me

142
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,290
and why did you leave Mack?

143
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,331
- I'm leaving Mack because Mack left me

144
00:05:58,331 --> 00:06:02,810
'cause he couldn't stand
seeing who I really am.

145
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,240
- She's lost her mind, she's
been like that for months.

146
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,319
She's been hysterical
and ranting and raving,

147
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:11,290
and I never know what
the hell I'm gonna get.

148
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,750
She's mercurial.

149
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,391
- Who I really am when
I'm not the happy person

150
00:06:16,391 --> 00:06:19,400
all the time and the hot
person and the up person

151
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,510
and the person who can just
take care of everything.

152
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:26,780
- She's accusing me of
fucking around on her.

153
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,880
- Oh my god.
- No matter what I say,

154
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,701
I cannot assure her that
that isn't happening,

155
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:34,290
and she took off.

156
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,800
- I don't cheat, he does.
- He cheats.

157
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,900
He cheats.
- He does.

158
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,540
- You're convinced he does,
I'm convinced he doesn't.

159
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,210
- I think I chose a man
just like our father.

160
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,560
- She's like living with Jekyll and Hyde.

161
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,540
- The only thing I know is
somebody's good looking,

162
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,303
who's got the world by the tail

163
00:06:49,303 --> 00:06:51,090
and can get anything he wants.

164
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,740
- Sit down and talk to her, Mack, just--

165
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,550
- I've sat down and talked,
believe me, oh, my god.

166
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,050
- Where'd she go?

167
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,941
- She went to Moxie's.

168
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:00,103
- Moxie?
- Moxie is my--

169
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:01,186
- Your daughter?
- Oh, my god.

170
00:07:01,186 --> 00:07:02,019
So Moxie must be really upset.

171
00:07:02,019 --> 00:07:04,268
- It's my stepdaughter, her daughter.

172
00:07:04,268 --> 00:07:06,041

00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:31,984
- [Moxie] No, wait, no, wait, wait.

179
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:34,560
- What, we're going to bed now?

180
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,226
- No.
- Want me to back away?

181
00:07:36,226 --> 00:07:37,746
- No, no.
- What?

182
00:07:37,746 --> 00:07:38,579
What?

183
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:39,530
- I haven't gotten my period.

184
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:42,056
- What, right now you're
gonna bring this up?

185
00:07:42,056 --> 00:07:43,147
- Well, I think we should,

186
00:07:43,147 --> 00:07:44,255
I think we should talk about it.

187
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,088
- Oh, God.

188
00:07:45,088 --> 00:07:45,980
- Haven't gotten it.

189
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,666
Wait, it's the longest it's ever been.

190
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:53,327
I mean, I always get it on time.

191
00:07:53,327 --> 00:07:55,140
- Moxie, Moxie, I'm sure
it's not a big deal.

192
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,613
- What?
- It's not a big deal.

193
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,653
- Moxie, you ready?

194
00:08:03,653 --> 00:08:04,520
- Ready!

195
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,733
- And action!

196
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:08,292
- Hi, kids, welcome to another episode

197
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:10,588
of "Mrs. Goldenrod's Roundup,"

198
00:08:10,588 --> 00:08:13,443
with your favorite doggie, Corndog!

199
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:16,172
(laughing)

200
00:08:16,172 --> 00:08:17,674
Hi, Corndog!

201
00:08:17,674 --> 00:08:19,150
- Hi, Mrs. Goldenrod.

202
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,234
- Ooh, how are you today?

203
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:24,730
- I'm great, I just
went to the dog groomer.

204
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,580
- You look so nice, Corndog.

205
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,821
(Moxie laughing)

206
00:08:27,821 --> 00:08:31,777
And today we have a special
guest, Godfrey the Goose!

207
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,990
- [Godfrey] Hi, guys, how are you?

208
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,990
- Hi, Godfrey!

209
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,816
- Hey, hey, what is that?

210
00:08:38,816 --> 00:08:39,936
- That's a goose.

211
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:40,769
- What's a goose?

212
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:42,440
- That is a dog?
- What's a goose?

213
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,360
PRODUCER: Camera three.

214
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,551
- Are you a girl goose or a boy goose?

215
00:08:47,551 --> 00:08:49,678
- [Godfrey] I am a boy goose.

216
00:08:49,678 --> 00:08:51,980
- What am I supposed to do with it?

217
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,436
- What would you like
to do with it, Corndog?

218
00:08:53,436 --> 00:08:55,246
- I'd like to eat it!

219
00:08:55,246 --> 00:08:58,512
(Godfrey screaming)

220
00:08:58,512 --> 00:09:01,345
Stay here, goose, while I eat you!

221
00:09:02,384 --> 00:09:03,944
Oh, you're a good goose.

222
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:05,526
- Get him, Corndog, get him!

223
00:09:05,526 --> 00:09:06,484
- That's a good one.

224
00:09:06,484 --> 00:09:07,478
(thudding)

225
00:09:07,478 --> 00:09:08,592
- [Producer] Cut!

226
00:09:08,592 --> 00:09:09,510
Are you okay?

227
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,343
- I'm fine.

228
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,000
- James, when you come in on that two-shot

229
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,520
with Moxie and I in the beginning,

230
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,925
just will you pitch the
camera up a little higher,

231
00:09:21,925 --> 00:09:23,920
come into us because
the lights are so hot,

232
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,690
it just makes us look--

233
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,645
- I can do that.
- Okay.

234
00:09:26,645 --> 00:09:30,875
- Hi, hon.
- Hi. Hi.

235
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,880
- What are you doing?

236
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,827
- I'm, uh, looking at my cellphone.

237
00:09:36,816 --> 00:09:39,870
- I see that, but why
are you not in makeup?

238
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,740
You're not getting ready?

239
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,270
- My vagina hurts.
- You've got a show--

240
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,890
Come on, we don't need to
talk about your vagina--

241
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,150
- My ovaries.

242
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,099
- It's not appropriate here, is it?

243
00:09:48,099 --> 00:09:50,860
- Are swollen, I haven't gotten my period.

244
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,800
- Okay, all right, I understand.

245
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,400
- In a week and a half.

246
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,010
- It's okay.
- I am overdue.

247
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:55,960
- Honey?
- What?

248
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,273
- Calm down.

249
00:09:57,273 --> 00:09:58,106
- I'm calm.

250
00:09:58,106 --> 00:10:00,678
Hey, I am calm, I am calmer than calm.

251
00:10:00,678 --> 00:10:01,904
(phone ringing)

252
00:10:01,904 --> 00:10:02,737
- You're very calm.

253
00:10:02,737 --> 00:10:03,695
You're beautiful.

254
00:10:03,695 --> 00:10:05,318
- It's my mom again.

255
00:10:05,318 --> 00:10:06,151
Talk to her.

256
00:10:06,151 --> 00:10:07,200
- Why are you crying?

257
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,450
It's good to talk to your mom.

258
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,150
Hello, hi.

259
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,050
Carson, hi.

260
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,336
What, I, um, something's wrong.

261
00:10:16,336 --> 00:10:18,970
Moxie's sleeping right now.

262
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,640
She can't talk but she's
cramping really bad.

263
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,823
Do you have any advice?

264
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,213
What?

265
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,790
No, no, she's not sick,
she's got, you know,

266
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:35,600
it's the female thing, the
female issues, you know.

267
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,553
You're female.

268
00:10:38,762 --> 00:10:40,560
Yeah, yeah, it's really bad,

269
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,544
it's out of control right now.

270
00:10:41,544 --> 00:10:42,580
I don't know what's going on

271
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,219
but maybe, she's complaining.

272
00:10:44,219 --> 00:10:46,499
She's bloated, she hasn't had her period

273
00:10:46,499 --> 00:10:48,141
in a week and a half.

274
00:10:48,141 --> 00:10:49,573
- What, no.

275
00:10:49,573 --> 00:10:52,030
- I mean, I don't, I feel
like I shouldn't even

276
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,394
be talking to you about this stuff.

277
00:10:54,394 --> 00:10:55,800
- Invite her over for dinner.
- No, don't be sorry,

278
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,936
don't be sorry, don't be sorry.

279
00:10:56,936 --> 00:10:58,466
You know, listen, yeah,

280
00:10:58,466 --> 00:11:00,619
we should sit down and talk

281
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:03,490
'cause we don't have enough time together.

282
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,463
- You.
- We gotta have lunch.

283
00:11:06,463 --> 00:11:08,560
- You make, make.

284
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,423
You make her dinner, you.

285
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,779
- I'm trying to get to it,
give me a second, okay?

286
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:14,710
- Spaghetti.

287
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,443
- Moxie, calm down, just calm down.

288
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,670
- Make her dinner, make her dinner.

289
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,510
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Carson.

290
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,030
Things are really hectic
here at the studio,

291
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:26,160
but all I was saying is I
would really love to have you

292
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,230
come over and make dinner
for you so we can discuss,

293
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:33,876
we can discuss these
emotions that seem to be

294
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:35,580
running very high at the moment.

295
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,617
I don't understand why--
- I don't wanna talk

296
00:11:36,617 --> 00:11:40,102
about my emotions, I want
you to make her spaghetti.

297
00:11:40,102 --> 00:11:41,273
- Honey, please.
- Please.

298
00:11:41,273 --> 00:11:43,680
- I know, I know, I
know, but you know what?

299
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,480
We're gonna set something, maybe tonight,

300
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,470
what are you doing?

301
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,600
- No.
- No?

302
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,900
Okay, or this week,

303
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,454
this week at some point.

304
00:11:50,454 --> 00:11:51,600
- No, next, next.

305
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,930
- We're gonna get together.

306
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,741
Okay, bye, honey, bye bye.

307
00:11:54,741 --> 00:11:57,408
(phone beeping)

308
00:12:09,342 --> 00:12:12,425
(lighthearted music)

309
00:12:17,972 --> 00:12:18,805
- Doesn't make any sense.

310
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:20,145
By the time we get back to the chateau,

311
00:12:20,145 --> 00:12:21,780
we're not gonna wanna go back.

312
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,200
- I can't do the other meeting, no.

313
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,673
He said after, we'll call
you after we get back.

314
00:12:24,673 --> 00:12:26,405
- This may take longer than we expected.

315
00:12:26,405 --> 00:12:28,340
- Okay, we're heading in right now.

316
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,173
Bye.

317
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:35,803
Hi.

318
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,870
- Hey, Doug Dengrove.

319
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,799
- Doug, how are you?

320
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,744
- Harry Rubinek.

321
00:12:39,744 --> 00:12:41,110
- Hi, Louie Hess.

322
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,948
- Lou.
- Hi.

323
00:12:41,948 --> 00:12:43,937
- How are you? We've heard
so much about you, really.

324
00:12:43,937 --> 00:12:44,770
- Thank you.

325
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,307
- Since we're here, let me show
you the master control room.

326
00:12:47,307 --> 00:12:49,190
- Well, you know what, to be honest,

327
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,510
I'm not much of a tech guy,

328
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,510
but I would love to
address the employees ASAP.

329
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,420
- Um, okay.
- Whatever you want, sure.

330
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,263
- Yeah, that's.
- Come on.

331
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:00,903
- Fantastic.

332
00:13:00,903 --> 00:13:02,560
- How was the trip?

333
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,837
- Great.
- Yeah?

334
00:13:03,837 --> 00:13:06,180
- Wow, across the whole country.

335
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,827
- Yeah, the flight was great, yeah, yeah.

336
00:13:09,827 --> 00:13:12,970
- I wish you guys would
have given us some notice,

337
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,352
we would've made a little presentation.

338
00:13:15,352 --> 00:13:17,442
- I like the element of surprise.

339
00:13:17,442 --> 00:13:19,012
- That's Terry.

340
00:13:19,012 --> 00:13:20,179
- Hi.
- Terry.

341
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,309
- Hi, welcome.

342
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:24,142
- It's beautiful.

343
00:13:24,142 --> 00:13:26,360
- You'll find all the people over here.

344
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,193
Why don't you tell 'em about it.

345
00:13:27,193 --> 00:13:29,253
- This is H&R right here.

346
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,890
Our great staff.

347
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,465
- It all happens from here, the numbers.

348
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:36,270
- Why don't you take a look around.

349
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,137
Introduce 'em, Louie.
- Hi, guys.

350
00:13:38,137 --> 00:13:38,970
- Hi.

351
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:39,803
- This is what makes it all work.

352
00:13:39,803 --> 00:13:41,856
- Hello, Charlie Moon,
I'm from corporate office

353
00:13:41,856 --> 00:13:43,350
in New York, how are you?

354
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,200
- Come this way.
- Nice to meet you.

355
00:13:46,254 --> 00:13:50,430
- This is Julie, say hi, okay, let's go.

356
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,020
Let me take you to the
creative part of this place.

357
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,490
- Our programming is down here.

358
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,940
- Well, it all happens
here, it starts, you know?

359
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,863
The genesis of all the
programming is right here,

360
00:13:59,863 --> 00:14:02,560
and you'll meet somebody who really is

361
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,557
the heart and soul of it all, Sherry Baum.

362
00:14:05,557 --> 00:14:07,389
- Hi, Sherry, some friends from New York.

363
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:08,222
- Oh, yes.

364
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,830
- Charlie Moon.
- Oh, yes.

365
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,990
- Harry Rubinek.
- How are you?

366
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,280
- You're Charlie Moon?
- Charlie Moon,

367
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,380
hi, how's it going?
- Great to meet you.

368
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,150
- Nice to meet you.
- Welcome.

369
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,180
- Thank you, thanks for having us.

370
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,572
- It begins here.
- It begins here,

371
00:14:18,572 --> 00:14:19,405
that's right.

372
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:22,105
- Charlie Moon, corporate, how are you?

373
00:14:22,105 --> 00:14:23,120
- Good to meet you.
- I love that color,

374
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,740
that's a vibrant color.

375
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,760
How, how are you, Charlie.

376
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,670
- Harry.
- This is Harry.

377
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,210
- Nice to see you, nice to see you.

378
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,840
- Good to meet you.
- How are you, pleasure.

379
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,160
- Are we having a good day?

380
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,230
- Yes, we are.

381
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,350
- Everyone, we have a
visitor from New York.

382
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,980
Please stand here, everyone, stand up!

383
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,240
We have a visitor, he's
going to speak to us, please.

384
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,300
- Thank you, Sherry.

385
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,840
Hi, guys, my name is Charlie Moon.

386
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,100
Call me Charlie, please.

387
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,700
This is my associate, Harry Rubinek.

388
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,410
We're gonna be with you
for a couple of days.

389
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,158
As a parent company,
we're always reviewing

390
00:14:49,158 --> 00:14:52,330
our satellite stations to
see how we can help you

391
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,200
run things more efficiently,
more economically.

392
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,870
Now, despite falling ratings,

393
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,290
less-than-stellar earnings,

394
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,420
and a really crappy economy,

395
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,660
I am very optimistic
about this station here

396
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,800
because you've always
held a very strong place

397
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,147
in the earnings of the network,

398
00:15:06,147 --> 00:15:08,054
although maybe not so
much in the last year,

399
00:15:08,054 --> 00:15:11,170
but then again, who has, right?

400
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:14,752
Um, unfortunately, the severe
downturn in the whole economy

401
00:15:14,752 --> 00:15:17,900
has forced us to make
adjustments, that's nationwide.

402
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,840
That's across the board,

403
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,900
I don't think that's gonna
be a surprise to anybody.

404
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,610
Um, I'll know more over the next few days.

405
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,420
That's about it, I think.

406
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,820
- You wanna talk about--
- Oh, right, right, right.

407
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,130
- The numbers if you want.

408
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,630
- Yes, we have gotten
some reports in New York

409
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:36,410
about some bookkeeping issues,
some financial discrepancies.

410
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,850
I don't think it's gonna be a big deal.

411
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,550
I'm sure we'll get to the bottom of it.

412
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,632
That said, I wanna thank
all of you for many years

413
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:47,400
of excellent work and
service to the company.

414
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,332
It has not gone unnoticed
by corporate in New York

415
00:15:50,332 --> 00:15:54,790
and most importantly, any
ideas, comments, questions,

416
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:58,000
concerns, please bring
them to your superiors.

417
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,274
I'm going to have one-on-one meetings

418
00:15:59,274 --> 00:16:01,309
with all the key
executives in their office

419
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:04,030
and if you see me walking
around, you can ask me too,

420
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,542
or Harry, and if anybody
knows a good poker game

421
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:10,360
while I'm in town, I'm game, all right.

422
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,480
Thank you very much.

423
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,559
- Great. (clapping)
- Pleasure to meet you all.

424
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:14,994
(all clapping)

425
00:16:14,994 --> 00:16:16,764
- [Harry] Thank you very much.

426
00:16:16,764 --> 00:16:17,597
- [Sherry] Thank you.

427
00:16:17,597 --> 00:16:18,430
Back to work, everyone.

428
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,069
Let's go.
- Can we get a coffee?

429
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:21,190
I would love one, yeah.

430
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,245
Thanks, guys.

431
00:16:22,245 --> 00:16:23,460
- Thank you, everyone.

432
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,210
- At ease, okay.
- Back to work.

433
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,510
- Right this way, gentlemen.

434
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:34,314
This is our top-rated show, "X
Sports," this is Mack Riley.

435
00:16:34,314 --> 00:16:35,380
- Oh, hey.

436
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,213
- Mick?

437
00:16:36,213 --> 00:16:37,263
Charlie.
- Mack, Mack.

438
00:16:38,852 --> 00:16:40,567
- Harry Rubinek, nice to meet you.

439
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:42,600
- Nice to meet you, this
is my assistant, Lana.

440
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,554
- Lana, Harry.

441
00:16:43,554 --> 00:16:44,387
How are you?
- Hi, nice to meet you.

442
00:16:44,387 --> 00:16:46,160
- We can talk about this later, okay?

443
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,560
- Okay.
- Thanks.

444
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,217
- What's the name of the show?

445
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,784
- "Mack Riley's Extreme Sports."

446
00:16:50,784 --> 00:16:53,380
- These gentlemen are from corporate.

447
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,853
They're here to have a look around today.

448
00:16:54,853 --> 00:16:57,630
- Yeah, welcome to our humble station.

449
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,201
- So what's an extreme sport,

450
00:16:59,201 --> 00:17:00,286
what would you consider?

451
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:02,133
- Well, there's--
- Hunting?

452
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:03,867
- No, hunting's not an extreme,

453
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:05,430
it can be but no, not.

454
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,750
- You don't handle that kind of stuff.

455
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,243
I would think hunting's
the most extreme sport.

456
00:17:09,243 --> 00:17:12,552
- It can be if you're
hunting with Dick Cheney.

457
00:17:12,552 --> 00:17:14,397
- (laughing) Yeah, right, exactly.

458
00:17:14,397 --> 00:17:17,852
- Skiing, surfing, hang gliding.

459
00:17:17,852 --> 00:17:19,530
- Skateboarding, stuff like that?

460
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:20,940
- Skateboarding, yeah,
anything with a board

461
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,184
and gravity involved, yeah, sure.

462
00:17:23,184 --> 00:17:24,330
- All right, everybody ready,

463
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,548
Thanksgiving rehearsal.

464
00:17:25,548 --> 00:17:27,170
And action.

465
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,780
- Hi, kids, welcome to another episode

466
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,362
of "Mrs. Goldenrod's Roundup,"

467
00:17:31,362 --> 00:17:35,701
starring your favorite doggie, Corndog!

468
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:37,430
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

469
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:40,617
hey, kids, happy Thanksgiving!

470
00:17:40,617 --> 00:17:42,749
- Get down off that
couch, Corndog, right now!

471
00:17:42,749 --> 00:17:46,198
- It's my catwalk, I mean dogwalk,

472
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,379
hey, woo, hey, hey!

473
00:17:48,379 --> 00:17:50,995
- Corndog, how many times
I gotta tell you, get down!

474
00:17:50,995 --> 00:17:53,090
- Mrs. Goldenrod, will
you give me an itch?

475
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:53,923
Just a little itch.

476
00:17:53,923 --> 00:17:56,239
- Corndoggy, Corndoggy, good dog.

477
00:17:56,239 --> 00:17:57,410
- Yes!
- Corndog, good dog.

478
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,243
Good dog.
- Yes, yes, yes.

479
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,690
- Now, Corndog, this week
is Thanksgiving week.

480
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,680
Do you know what Thanksgiving's all about?

481
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,591
- Turkey, gravy.
- Well, yes.

482
00:18:05,591 --> 00:18:07,320
- Mashed potatoes.

483
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,440
- That's true.

484
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,790
But Thanksgiving is also
about giving thanks--

485
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,350
- Cut, all right.

486
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,460
Take it again from
turkey and Thanksgiving.

487
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,293
- Okay.

488
00:18:15,293 --> 00:18:16,707
- What's this one called?

489
00:18:16,707 --> 00:18:18,590
- "Mrs. Goldenrod's Roundup."

490
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,223
- Yeah, it's the most
popular children's show

491
00:18:20,223 --> 00:18:21,795
in southern California.

492
00:18:21,795 --> 00:18:22,810
- Let me see the file.

493
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,994
- I sometimes jump in there and perform.

494
00:18:24,994 --> 00:18:25,840
- You?

495
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,373
- Yeah, I play the Cheeky Monkey.

496
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,010
- Turkey, mashed potatoes!

497
00:18:33,257 --> 00:18:34,930
- Well, that's true, Corndog,

498
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,733
but Thanksgiving is
also about giving thanks

499
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:40,490
to everything we have in our life.

500
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,830
- It is kind of a cult
hit among teenagers.

501
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,010
- Ham hocks.

502
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:44,950
- Ham hocks?

503
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,742
- Stuffing! (growling)

504
00:18:46,742 --> 00:18:47,916
- Oh, those things too.

505
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:51,090
Corndog, Corndog, slow down.

506
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:54,230
- I love stuffing, I don't know
about you guys but I know--

507
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,353
- Are you aware that it
lost 6% of its viewership

508
00:18:56,353 --> 00:18:57,723
in the past four quarters?

509
00:18:58,935 --> 00:19:00,403
- (gasping) Put down my purse!

510
00:19:00,403 --> 00:19:01,236
- She's got the purse.

511
00:19:01,236 --> 00:19:03,040
- Put down my purse, Corndog.

512
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,792
Bad dog, bad dog, drop that!

513
00:19:04,792 --> 00:19:05,975
(laughing)

514
00:19:05,975 --> 00:19:06,953
Bad!

515
00:19:06,953 --> 00:19:09,550
- She's on the couch.
- Cut!

516
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,573
- Who are the suits?

517
00:19:11,964 --> 00:19:13,303
- Hi.

518
00:19:13,303 --> 00:19:14,136
- Hi.

519
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:15,250
- [Charlie] Hi, how are you?

520
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,340
- Hi, I'm Moxie.

521
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,090
- My name's Charlie, it's a pleasure.

522
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:21,923
- Charlie?

523
00:19:21,923 --> 00:19:23,550
- Charlie.

524
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,823
You have a new fan now.

525
00:19:26,185 --> 00:19:27,035
How are you, son?

526
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,457
- Hey, how are you?
- Morning, guys.

527
00:19:29,457 --> 00:19:32,430
- I'm Charlie, I'm from
corporate office in New York.

528
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,263
- Johnnie.

529
00:19:33,263 --> 00:19:34,096
- Johnnie.

530
00:19:34,096 --> 00:19:35,500
- Harry Rubinek, Johnnie,
nice to meet you.

531
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,333
- Johnnie.

532
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,440
- What's doing?

533
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,607
- Uh, just routing some
files here, you know.

534
00:19:39,607 --> 00:19:41,530
- Rounding some files?

535
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,363
- Routing.

536
00:19:42,363 --> 00:19:43,550
- Routing some files, do
you know what that means?

537
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,553
- He's the IP guy, I take it.

538
00:19:45,553 --> 00:19:46,386
- Uh.

539
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:47,830
- [Charlie] What language is that?

540
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,717
- Some of it's Chinese,
most of it's Chinese.

541
00:19:49,717 --> 00:19:52,345
- [Charlie] Most of it's Chinese, hmm.

542
00:19:52,345 --> 00:19:54,610
Do you speak Chinese?

543
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,540
- Yeah, I mean moderately.
- How did you learn Chinese?

544
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,023
- You know, in the technology business,

545
00:19:59,023 --> 00:20:00,770
it's kind of mandatory.

546
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:03,120
- And what runs through this computer?

547
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,947
Is it production stuff, is
it content stuff, is it--

548
00:20:05,947 --> 00:20:07,220
- Anything you want.

549
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,100
- Account stuff?

550
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,742
- All of the above.

551
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,573
- Payroll, things like that, too?

552
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:16,190
- Um, yeah, I could get that up for you.

553
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,168
- Huh.

554
00:20:17,168 --> 00:20:18,950
- I mean, I'm not in charge
of any of that, though,

555
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:19,783
I'm just an intern.

556
00:20:19,783 --> 00:20:21,630
Can I help you guys with something?

557
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,090
- We're just taking a tour of the office

558
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,780
and we were curious what
you were doing here.

559
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,800
- Yeah, I'm looking around,

560
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,183
we're learning what
goes on here, you know?

561
00:20:27,183 --> 00:20:28,594
- Are you the high-ups?

562
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,930
- You could say that. (chuckling)

563
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,620
- Hey!
- Hey, Rich.

564
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,627
- How's it going?

565
00:20:33,627 --> 00:20:34,570
Good to see you.

566
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,115
- You did Mrs. Goldenhair.

567
00:20:36,115 --> 00:20:37,532
- Mrs. Goldenrod.

568
00:20:38,692 --> 00:20:39,525
How's it going?

569
00:20:39,525 --> 00:20:40,358
- Good, good, you were wonderful.

570
00:20:40,358 --> 00:20:42,065
- Thank you so much.
- You still got a little...

571
00:20:42,065 --> 00:20:43,760
- A little--
- Lipstick.

572
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,930
- I've been doing it for three years

573
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,500
and it takes forever
to get that stuff off.

574
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,326
- It's very funny.
- Thank you.

575
00:20:48,326 --> 00:20:49,159
Thank you very much.

576
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:51,483
- You know, this is one of the
guys I report to, actually.

577
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,213
- Really?

578
00:20:53,213 --> 00:20:54,884
You work on the show?

579
00:20:54,884 --> 00:20:59,450
- No, no, no, I report
my IT stuff to Rich.

580
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:02,740
- We do a bit of everything
here and Johnnie's created--

581
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,330
- So you do the computer stuff
here as well as act on the--

582
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,520
- I do a bit because I do a bit of editing

583
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,940
so I know computers very well,

584
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,243
and Johnnie's a whiz on
the computers, he's great.

585
00:21:11,243 --> 00:21:12,999
- Yeah, that's what we were hearing.

586
00:21:12,999 --> 00:21:17,250
(lively electronic music)

587
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,409
- Einstein never could
accept quantum mechanics.

588
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:22,783
He called it "spooky
science at a distance"

589
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:24,980
because it didn't follow all physical laws

590
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,910
that we knew up to now.

591
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,800
Two objects could exist in
the same place at one time.

592
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,025
One object could be in two
places at the same time.

593
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,519
Action on one object
could influence the other.

594
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:38,690
To Einstein, this was impossible,

595
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:40,710
and he spent forever trying to refute it

596
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,190
but he couldn't refute it and apparently--

597
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,527
- I have to ask you a question
because I'm sure somebody

598
00:21:44,527 --> 00:21:46,980
out there just like me has questions.

599
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,120
You say you can see atoms,
how do you see them?

600
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,070
- I don't see them.

601
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,530
- I'm, like, I'm the manager
of a baseball team, right?

602
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:57,310
My job is to bring the
team to the World Series

603
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,410
and to do that, I'm gonna
do whatever's necessary.

604
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,937
If I have to go out and get a lefty ace,

605
00:22:00,937 --> 00:22:04,040
I'm gonna do it for my team, right?

606
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,024
If Posada's hitting 40 and he can't

607
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:08,580
get behind the plate
anymore, I may try him at DH

608
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,523
and if that doesn't work,
he may have to retire,

609
00:22:10,523 --> 00:22:11,663
you know what I mean?

610
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,940
- Who's hitting 40 at this table?

611
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,880
- I'm not saying anybody's hitting 40.

612
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,354
- You know, I just hate traditional sport.

613
00:22:17,354 --> 00:22:18,328
- No, no, you know what I mean.

614
00:22:18,328 --> 00:22:19,720
(Moxie laughing)
You're a sports guy, right?

615
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,475
- Yeah.
- Posada's a Yankee.

616
00:22:21,475 --> 00:22:22,931
- We're a sports team.

617
00:22:22,931 --> 00:22:24,190
- You've lost me now,

618
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,300
I don't know what you're talking about.

619
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,740
- What I'm saying is, what's
good for you is good for us,

620
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,310
what's good for us is what's good for you.

621
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,750
If you guys are thriving,
we're thriving, you understand?

622
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,980
- We seem to be very happy so--

623
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,652
- I mean, there may be
things you guys need

624
00:22:35,652 --> 00:22:37,554
that you're not getting and

625
00:22:37,554 --> 00:22:40,170
the network can have the support--

626
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,230
- Wait, wait, wait, you're
not talking about firing.

627
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,063
- [Charlie] No.

628
00:22:43,063 --> 00:22:45,241
- Then you're saying that if
you needed to switch players

629
00:22:45,241 --> 00:22:49,168
or change the batting order or bring--

630
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:50,650
- Yeah, change the batting order.

631
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:53,505
- That sounds to me like
something's gonna happen.

632
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:54,340
- No, no, no, look, look--

633
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,570
- Guys, guys, can we keep this
PC here because, you know,

634
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,380
at the end of the day, we
want to make these guys

635
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,030
our friends, right, we
don't want to attack 'em.

636
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:00,863
- No, I'm really don't--

637
00:23:00,863 --> 00:23:02,540
- That's why we're sitting
down having dinner.

638
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:05,790
(everyone talking at once)

639
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:06,650
- All due respect.

640
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,510
- Really, what can we do to help you?

641
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,680
- I think what we need to know--

642
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,350
- Is there things that
have been neglected?

643
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,734
Are there things that you feel

644
00:23:13,734 --> 00:23:15,620
that corporate in New York--

645
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,340
- We could use bigger budgets.
- Hasn't been giving you

646
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,734
enough attention in certain departments.

647
00:23:18,734 --> 00:23:20,230
- Wait, wait a minute, wait--
- Bigger budgets.

648
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,970
- We could all use bigger
budgets, my friend.

649
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:23,906
- Better sets.
- We have to, we have to--

650
00:23:23,906 --> 00:23:25,580
- Can I please speak for a minute?

651
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,250
- We're talking job security.

652
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,520
- That's what we want, we want
to get the insider's view,

653
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,600
you know, an insider's
perspective on what's going on

654
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,433
and that would help.

655
00:23:32,433 --> 00:23:34,010
- You know what, at the end of the day,

656
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,161
I wanna know after you
guys leave in five days,

657
00:23:36,161 --> 00:23:38,002
who's not going to be here.

658
00:23:38,002 --> 00:23:39,352
- Okay, Louie, Louie!

659
00:23:39,352 --> 00:23:40,250
- Yes?

660
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,004
- This is why talent should not be brought

661
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:44,133
into these meetings right now because--

662
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:45,209
- Because I'm asking?

663
00:23:45,209 --> 00:23:47,874
- Talent has a tendency
towards emotion and theatrics.

664
00:23:47,874 --> 00:23:50,320
(all talking at once)

665
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,510
- Okay, I have had enough.

666
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:55,420
This talent has two degrees.

667
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:59,990
Also, graduated as
valedictorian from her college!

668
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:04,520
And you sit here having read some stupid

669
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,060
being an executive bullshit.

670
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,590
- We're not the enemy, guys.

671
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:11,640
- My tits hurt and I'm getting my period!

672
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,463
No, Ange, let's go!

673
00:24:14,463 --> 00:24:18,508
Ange, come with me, I'm out
of here, this is bullshit!

674
00:24:18,508 --> 00:24:21,923
This is bullshit, charts and bullshit!

675
00:24:21,923 --> 00:24:26,630
- Now, this is why I
was saying it's not wise

676
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,800
to bring talent into executive meetings.

677
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,967
- Oh my god.

678
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:31,380
- That's not about that,
it's that time of the month.

679
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,787
- We all fall victim to
grade-school theatrics

680
00:24:33,787 --> 00:24:35,698
and ridiculous emotions.

681
00:24:35,698 --> 00:24:37,976
(all talking at once)

682
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,123
- This should be done at another time.

683
00:24:39,123 --> 00:24:40,926
This should be done,
it's not about talent.

684
00:24:40,926 --> 00:24:42,437
This should be done another time,

685
00:24:42,437 --> 00:24:44,549
not when we're supposed to be eating.

686
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:47,549
(crickets chirping)

687
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,920
- I don't understand why you
peeled all those, because--

688
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,133
- Because it tastes
better, it cooks better.

689
00:24:54,163 --> 00:24:57,032
(all talking at once)

690
00:24:57,032 --> 00:24:58,605
(phone ringing)

691
00:24:58,605 --> 00:25:00,270
- It's Polynesian, it's Polynesian.

692
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,480
- Hello?

693
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,905
- Moxie, Charlie Moon.

694
00:25:02,905 --> 00:25:04,076
- Charlie.

695
00:25:04,076 --> 00:25:07,057
Hey, hey, hey, work, work, shh.

696
00:25:07,057 --> 00:25:09,763
Hey, Charlie, um, what's up?

697
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,977
- I just wanna make
sure you got home okay.

698
00:25:12,977 --> 00:25:15,010
It's a New York thing.

699
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:19,510
- Yeah, I'm fine, if you can
call it that, I guess, yeah.

700
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,460
- Listen, I don't like
getting off on the wrong foot

701
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,059
with anybody, especially talent.

702
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:25,310
- Oh, well. (scoffing)

703
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,670
Don't sweat it, New York, I'm fine.

704
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,090
- Oh, Jesus, you're one of those.

705
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:31,100
- Is this an apology phone call or what?

706
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,260
I'm not getting it.

707
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,093
- An apology?

708
00:25:33,093 --> 00:25:36,230
Um, I don't really know
what I'd be apologizing for,

709
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:40,640
but if you want one, what can
I do to make it up to you?

710
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,510
- Well, what are you doing right now?

711
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,420
- I'm going back to my hotel.

712
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,969
- Where are you staying at?

713
00:25:46,969 --> 00:25:48,870
- Chateau Marmont.

714
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,770
- Oh, that's, like, five minutes away.

715
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,390
- Come over?

716
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:01,184
- I think that would be
very educational for you.

717
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,860
- (laughing) I think I have had

718
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,670
enough education for one night.

719
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:09,083
- Just trust me, it's 5471
1/2 North Crescent Heights.

720
00:26:10,327 --> 00:26:12,040
Can you find that?

721
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,750
- I'll put it in my GPS, I'll
be over there in a little bit.

722
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,950
- Okay.

723
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,410
- Okay, all right, bye.

724
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,283
- See you then, bye.

725
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,665
- What's going on?
- Who's that?

726
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:23,498
- [Moxie] Okay, it's hung up.

727
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:24,880
- Okay, who is that?
- What's going on?

728
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,500
- It's, it's, it's. (sighing)

729
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,330
- Are you hooking up with--
- Do you like him?

730
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,280
- No!

731
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,730
Benny is my boyfriend.

732
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,140
- Oh, please, you can
do better than Benny.

733
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,710
- Stop it, stop it, stop it.
- Oh, come on.

734
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,034
- No, there's this guy from
New York and I'm just--

735
00:26:36,034 --> 00:26:37,180
- Is he cute?

736
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,013
- From New York?

737
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,450
- He's not, no!
- He's coming here?

738
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,116
- Yeah.
- Do we have to get dressed?

739
00:26:42,116 --> 00:26:42,949
- No.
- Do we have to hide?

740
00:26:42,949 --> 00:26:45,361
- I want him to see you
putting bananas on chicken.

741
00:26:45,361 --> 00:26:48,086
Be yourselves, so be yourselves.

742
00:26:48,086 --> 00:26:49,190
Have some more wine.

743
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,167
- What's his name?
- Who is he?

744
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:51,890
- Cheers yourselves.

745
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:52,772
- What's his name?

746
00:26:52,772 --> 00:26:55,897
- I want you guys to drink a
little more wine and celebrate.

747
00:26:55,897 --> 00:26:58,897
(crickets chirping)

748
00:27:08,402 --> 00:27:10,347
(knocking)

749
00:27:10,347 --> 00:27:11,802
(woman laughing)

750
00:27:11,802 --> 00:27:12,899
- [Charlie] Hello?

751
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:14,330
- Come in!

752
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,627
- Oh, my god.
- How are you?

753
00:27:16,627 --> 00:27:18,010
- We're great, we're just--

754
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,310
- Do you want some wine?

755
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,859
- Yeah, get him some wine.

756
00:27:20,859 --> 00:27:22,720
- Sure, I'll have some wine.

757
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,420
- This is Charlie.

758
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,310
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hi, Charlie.

759
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,114
- This is my lovely Aunt Rita.

760
00:27:28,114 --> 00:27:29,148
- Aunt Rita.

761
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:30,540
- Charlie, sit down.

762
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,727
- But you may call me Rita.

763
00:27:31,727 --> 00:27:33,730
- Make yourself at home.

764
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:36,100
- This is my mommy.
- Oh!

765
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,500
- Carson, here's some wine.

766
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,300
- This is Mrs. Moxie.

767
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,370
- Hi.
- How are you?

768
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:42,272
Now I can see where the
good looks come from.

769
00:27:42,272 --> 00:27:43,105
- This is Mommy Moxie.

770
00:27:43,105 --> 00:27:44,567
- [Moxie] This is Auntie Lulu.

771
00:27:44,567 --> 00:27:45,400
- Aunt Lulu.

772
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,233
- Hi.
- Pleasure.

773
00:27:46,233 --> 00:27:47,066
- Hello.

774
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:47,899
- Charlie.

775
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:49,470
- Your daughter's a real firecracker.

776
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,933
Did you know she was going to become one

777
00:27:50,933 --> 00:27:52,700
when you named her Moxie?

778
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,300
- Well, that was, you know,
she was supposed to be a boy

779
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,360
and her name was Maxie.

780
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,193
- Maxie.

781
00:27:59,193 --> 00:28:00,680
- She was such a firecracker

782
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,903
that everybody called
her Moxie and it stuck.

783
00:28:03,903 --> 00:28:06,550
- How are you feeling, Mommy?
- Great name.

784
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,372
- Mommy, what's going on?
- What's wrong?

785
00:28:08,372 --> 00:28:10,383
(Carson laughing)

786
00:28:10,383 --> 00:28:12,130
- Mommy, what are you feeling?

787
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,760
Mommy, what are you feeling right now?

788
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,780
- What am I feeling?

789
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,396
I'm feeling quite wet.

790
00:28:16,396 --> 00:28:18,040
(laughing)

791
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,910
- Is that a hot flash?

792
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:22,124
How does the hot flash--

793
00:28:22,124 --> 00:28:24,695
- Why do you always rub food on your body?

794
00:28:24,695 --> 00:28:25,898
We have to eat that!

795
00:28:25,898 --> 00:28:27,970
- It's cold, honey.

796
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:29,845
- You did this with the turkey.

797
00:28:29,845 --> 00:28:32,480
- Why are you bringing up
meat, you know it's upsetting.

798
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,350
- Oh, God, would you
stop being such a diva!

799
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,747
Why are you such a diva?

800
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,522
I don't care if you have your own beliefs

801
00:28:37,522 --> 00:28:40,155
but you don't have to inflict them on us!

802
00:28:40,155 --> 00:28:43,322
(all talking at once)

803
00:28:46,008 --> 00:28:46,841
And it tastes really good.

804
00:28:46,841 --> 00:28:47,799
Very soft!

805
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:49,040
- If I let these thoughts come to me,

806
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,040
I'm gonna fall apart.
- Would you stop?

807
00:28:51,916 --> 00:28:53,241
- All I need you to do is face reality--

808
00:28:53,241 --> 00:28:54,897
- Oh, God, let me get my little guitar.

809
00:28:54,897 --> 00:28:57,150
- No, it's not like that at
all and you're my sister!

810
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:57,983
- Stop.

811
00:28:57,983 --> 00:28:59,448
(all talking over each other)

812
00:28:59,448 --> 00:29:01,828
- (screaming) I can't stand it anymore!

813
00:29:01,828 --> 00:29:03,170
- Oh, God!

814
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:05,157
- I'm sorry if I'm intruding or something.

815
00:29:05,157 --> 00:29:06,003
- No, you're not.

816
00:29:06,003 --> 00:29:07,448
- Maybe I should, should I go?

817
00:29:07,448 --> 00:29:09,220
- Oh, my god, see?

818
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,884
Nobody wants you to
really be your real self.

819
00:29:10,884 --> 00:29:12,430
- Look at what you did to her.

820
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:14,457
- Stop lecturing me, what?
- You always do this to her.

821
00:29:14,457 --> 00:29:16,494
- I do this to her?
- She's running off screaming.

822
00:29:16,494 --> 00:29:18,420
- Are you kidding me, that's
what I was trying to say.

823
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,943
I'm so sorry.

824
00:29:19,943 --> 00:29:21,581
- We're not always like this.

825
00:29:21,581 --> 00:29:24,164
(mellow music)

826
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,709
- Sorry for all the craziness in there.

827
00:29:33,709 --> 00:29:34,542
- Why are you sorry?

828
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:35,479
I liked them.

829
00:29:35,479 --> 00:29:37,740
(Moxie laughing)
I did, I felt surprisingly

830
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,204
comfortable around them.

831
00:29:39,204 --> 00:29:41,634
They're pretty funny though.

832
00:29:41,634 --> 00:29:44,013
- Yeah, they are funny.

833
00:29:51,218 --> 00:29:53,210
You saw what's going on in there.

834
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:55,893
This is going on all over
the country, the world.

835
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,030
It's going on in our station,

836
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:01,570
I mean, women of a certain age,

837
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,850
a lot of women in our station talk to me

838
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,150
about it all the time,
they're going through

839
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:09,240
varying degrees of this
and I need a chance

840
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,720
to pitch this to the senior execs.

841
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,455
Nobody's making a documentary about it.

842
00:30:14,455 --> 00:30:17,050
I mean, I don't even
have to leave the station

843
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,930
to make this documentary.

844
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:21,528
I can just make it in the station itself

845
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:26,200
and if I can just pitch it
to the top execs tomorrow,

846
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,117
if you just give me the go,
give me the green light, I--

847
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:30,070
- You want me to allow you
to pitch it to the execs--

848
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,397
- Yes, yes, yes, you stay neutral.

849
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:32,680
- Ah, okay.
- You can stay

850
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,967
neutral and then--

851
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:35,730
- So now you're asking something of me?

852
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,930
- I need a chance to sell this.

853
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,470
- You need me to give you the chance.

854
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,303
- Please.

855
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:44,030
- Well, I have a little problem with that.

856
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,913
- What?

857
00:30:47,665 --> 00:30:50,110
- I'm very attracted to you,

858
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,773
so if I do give you that opportunity,

859
00:30:54,234 --> 00:30:57,670
then maybe from a certain perspective,

860
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:58,772
you know what I mean?

861
00:30:58,772 --> 00:31:01,020
There might be a certain
motivation behind it.

862
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:06,010
I might be using my
position to benefit myself

863
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,510
and give myself a better shot.

864
00:31:10,556 --> 00:31:11,389
- Sorry.

865
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,910
Work, work, work, work.

866
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:16,700
- Yeah, yeah.
- Sorry, work, sorry.

867
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,947
- Okay, you got a deal.

868
00:31:18,938 --> 00:31:21,260
- Sorry.
- But I'm neutral.

869
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,337
- Right.
- Right.

870
00:31:28,316 --> 00:31:30,222
- I like your neutrality.

871
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,520
- Yeah.

872
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,710
- I really--
- Get busy.

873
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,543
- [Moxie] I will.

874
00:31:33,543 --> 00:31:35,302
- I want a whole
presentation tomorrow, okay?

875
00:31:35,302 --> 00:31:36,530
- Okay.

876
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,480
- Audio, visual.

877
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,050
- Okay, I even have
PowerPoint if you want it.

878
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,960
- PowerPoint, I want it all.

879
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,780
Dog-and-pony show, right?

880
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,613
- Okay.

881
00:31:49,426 --> 00:31:52,009
(upbeat music)

882
00:31:54,168 --> 00:31:56,260
(all talking at once)

883
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:59,230
- Excuse me, folks, can I
have your attention, please?

884
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,320
Hello!

885
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,153
Thank you.

886
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:06,360
Our friend Moxie has
been working on an idea.

887
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,240
She's been putting her brain to it

888
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,810
and I'd appreciate it if we all

889
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:11,673
give her our full attention.

890
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,533
- Thank you.

891
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:16,715
Well...

892
00:32:16,715 --> 00:32:17,548
(clearing throat)

893
00:32:17,548 --> 00:32:20,600
In the last four years, this station

894
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:25,600
has taken $5 million from broadcasting

895
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,910
and I think that in the last three days,

896
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:32,100
I have discovered from
my mother and my aunts

897
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,920
how to get over that hump and

898
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,380
I wanna show you guys why.

899
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,863
It's the biggest hush-hush
topic that has not been covered

900
00:32:40,863 --> 00:32:42,870
in the American culture,

901
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:47,200
I think in the world pretty
much but never on television,

902
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,337
never on talk shows, and
so I give you "The M Word."

903
00:32:52,853 --> 00:32:57,186
("The Battle Hymn of the Republic")

904
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,046
- I don't like the way it feels.

905
00:33:05,046 --> 00:33:07,230
- You know what, I am
so tired of you guys!

906
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,063
- They look disgusting!

907
00:33:08,063 --> 00:33:11,950
- The degree to which I am
angry is so out of whack.

908
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:12,800
- Would you stop?

909
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,145
- All I need you to do is face reality--

910
00:33:14,145 --> 00:33:15,977
- Oh, God, let me get my little guitar.

911
00:33:15,977 --> 00:33:19,310
- All of a sudden, the
insides start raging

912
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,620
and the insides become
bigger than the outside

913
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,100
and I don't know how to deal with it.

914
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,506
I feel like a crazy person.

915
00:33:25,506 --> 00:33:28,669
(screaming) I can't stand it anymore!

916
00:33:28,669 --> 00:33:30,010
- Oh, God!

917
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:30,860
- These aren't actors?

918
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,250
- No, no, family.

919
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,083
Just family.

920
00:33:34,083 --> 00:33:36,840
- It's unfair because
men don't go through it.

921
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,230
(Harry chuckling)

922
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:39,920
- That's my mother.

923
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,730
- Women do and we get
cellulite on top of it.

924
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,240
It's not fair.

925
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,810
- And those are my aunts.

926
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:48,310
- I can't help it,
sometimes this is who I am.

927
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,430
- And they are in my house.

928
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,738
- Turn that fucking television off!

929
00:33:52,738 --> 00:33:55,321
- My mind is gone, who are you?

930
00:33:56,175 --> 00:33:58,662
(taunting)

931
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:00,200
- Oh, my god.

932
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,730
- It's a change of life
but once you get through

933
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:06,553
the emotional part of
it, you become wiser.

934
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,423
You don't give a shit anymore.

935
00:34:11,423 --> 00:34:15,683
My freakin' husband, that
motherfucking husband!

936
00:34:15,683 --> 00:34:17,700
That fucking control freak.

937
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:20,620
They throw the women out as
soon as they hit menopause

938
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,580
and they go for somebody younger.

939
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,102
- It's all real material.

940
00:34:24,102 --> 00:34:28,271
- Right now I'm freezing, five
minutes ago we were sweating.

941
00:34:28,271 --> 00:34:30,250
(laughing)

942
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,994
- It is funny but it is tragic.

943
00:34:32,994 --> 00:34:36,443
Oh, no, Mom, who do you get angry at?

944
00:34:36,443 --> 00:34:41,443
- God, or somebody, it's
like what is going on?

945
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,550
- This is not normal behavior for them.

946
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,190
- I can't remember the names
of people who are close to me.

947
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,088
Mack!

948
00:34:48,088 --> 00:34:48,921
Mack?

949
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:52,760
I can't even remember
what I'm saying right now.

950
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,606
I forgot his name. (laughing)

951
00:34:55,606 --> 00:34:58,940
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I just--

952
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,700
- We are more who we are
now than we ever were.

953
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,800
- [Harry] Wow, really?

954
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:06,310
- We're not through the woods yet

955
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:08,140
and we may be burning up inside

956
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:11,460
but nobody's committing us
to institutions anymore.

957
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,500
They have to deal with us because

958
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,533
we're a force to be reckoned with.

959
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,783
- Yeah, this is something.

960
00:35:19,783 --> 00:35:23,843
- All right, so there's
just a taste for you guys.

961
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,700
That is a little trailer I put together.

962
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,240
People out there are
gonna be hungry for this

963
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,240
and if we can be the
first to get it out there,

964
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,820
this is just one household.

965
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,790
Imagine, we can profit,

966
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:39,331
if we go out to every household out there,

967
00:35:39,331 --> 00:35:42,650
we get the reality of the
situation, of menopause,

968
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:46,310
we get dialogue started
between husbands and wives,

969
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,710
between mothers and daughters.

970
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,510
I mean, my mother never
talked to me about it.

971
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,857
She just came over to
my house the other night

972
00:35:51,857 --> 00:35:54,190
and said she wasn't getting
along with my stepdad.

973
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:57,221
I mean, no offense, but,
you know, it's because--

974
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:58,970
- TMI, a little too much information.

975
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:01,670
- It's not, though, it's
because there hasn't been

976
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,270
communication between
you two because there's

977
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:05,525
no information accessible out there--

978
00:36:05,525 --> 00:36:06,722
- [Mack] Okay, we'll talk
about that another time.

979
00:36:06,722 --> 00:36:07,970
- There's no information, why wouldn't we

980
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:09,980
start dialogue about this, to share,

981
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,693
to make people open up.

982
00:36:11,693 --> 00:36:13,820
This is a beautiful thing
that we would be doing.

983
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:17,890
- One question, if nobody
knows about this, right?

984
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:20,450
It's, it's, how do you sell it?

985
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:21,881
- No, everybody knows about it.

986
00:36:21,881 --> 00:36:22,890
- Everybody knows about it.

987
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,200
Nobody talks about it.

988
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,340
- Moxie, Moxie.

989
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:28,553
Do you mind stepping
outside for a few minutes?

990
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:30,271
- Okay, but, I mean, I can,

991
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:33,390
but can I answer this question?

992
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,150
I mean, the way that you sell it

993
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,860
is you call it "The M Word."

994
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:39,087
You call it menopause, you call it--

995
00:36:39,087 --> 00:36:42,217
- Louie, Louie, we need to talk, please.

996
00:36:42,217 --> 00:36:43,340
- But there's a not--

997
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,840
- Give us a minute, please.
- Sorry, I know, I know.

998
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,470
- [Angela] I think it's fantastic, honey.

999
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,680
- We'll call you back in.
- It's fantastic.

1000
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,630
- But this is money, this is real money.

1001
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,520
This is real--

1002
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,101
- Good job, Moxie, good job.

1003
00:36:54,101 --> 00:36:56,351
(cheering)

1004
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,781
Good work!

1005
00:36:58,781 --> 00:36:59,614
- Moxie!

1006
00:37:00,988 --> 00:37:03,220
- Okay, what do we think?

1007
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,236
- It's fantastic!

1008
00:37:04,236 --> 00:37:06,191
- What do you mean, "What do
we think?" What do you think?

1009
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:07,890
It's absurd!

1010
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:09,293
- No, it's not absurd!

1011
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:11,310
- This is the worst fucking
idea I've ever heard.

1012
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:13,958
- You're so wrong, listen, where else--

1013
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:15,600
- Reminds me of dinner the other night

1014
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,743
but I don't see it as a TV show.

1015
00:37:16,743 --> 00:37:19,270
- No, no, no, I see it--
- Sherry.

1016
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,250
- Where else do you get
something like this?

1017
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,859
This is so--
- Leave it there!

1018
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:24,807
- Everyone wants to confide in this--

1019
00:37:24,807 --> 00:37:25,980
- Where are you--

1020
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,570
- Everyone wants to confide in Moxie.

1021
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,796
She's amazing, she's like a combination

1022
00:37:29,796 --> 00:37:31,191
between Ellen and Oprah.

1023
00:37:31,191 --> 00:37:32,223
- I love her to death,
I love her to death.

1024
00:37:32,223 --> 00:37:33,645
- She's a sweetheart.

1025
00:37:33,645 --> 00:37:34,670
That has nothing to do this

1026
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:36,430
having a place in television.

1027
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,370
- Guys, okay.

1028
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:39,960
If we're gonna talk on top of each other,

1029
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,880
we're not gonna know
what each of us thinks.

1030
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,573
Harry has something to say.
- Listen, I just wanna say

1031
00:37:45,573 --> 00:37:47,777
that a niche programming
for adults like this

1032
00:37:47,777 --> 00:37:49,600
might just be what this station needs

1033
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,670
to get the ratings back up,

1034
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,000
okay, no, no, wait a second.

1035
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,570
It's all niche right now, okay?

1036
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:54,870
It's not 20-year-olds anymore.

1037
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,790
Since Oprah, the whole
ballgame has changed

1038
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,615
and all the statistics
right now are showing

1039
00:37:58,615 --> 00:38:01,490
that the best market to
take advantage of right now

1040
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,770
is the 40, 50-year-old market.

1041
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:05,710
Okay, you need something like this.

1042
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,050
- Angela.

1043
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:10,770
- Menopause is not only
in America, all right?

1044
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,916
This is universal, it's worldly.

1045
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:13,749
- That's true.

1046
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:16,111
- This expands to everything.

1047
00:38:16,111 --> 00:38:21,000
Think of the sponsors, think
of the sponsors, doctors.

1048
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,130
- Harry's right, the demographics
move up every year in age,

1049
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:27,095
we don't have the content
to satisfy these audiences,

1050
00:38:27,095 --> 00:38:28,740
only reality TV.

1051
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,950
- Guys, the point--

1052
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,120
- I wanna make the show.

1053
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,525
- [Louie] You wanna make
the show, there you go.

1054
00:38:32,525 --> 00:38:34,119
- [Angela] I agree, right there.

1055
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:35,626
- I wanna make the show.

1056
00:38:35,626 --> 00:38:36,593
Corporate in New York--

1057
00:38:36,593 --> 00:38:37,726
- Does Moxie not have an amazing gift?

1058
00:38:37,726 --> 00:38:38,710
Does she not have an amazing gift?

1059
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,800
- All right, let me say this.

1060
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,050
This is a little close to home.

1061
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:47,610
It's a little bit, you
know, invasive, for me

1062
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:50,450
but I'm living with it all day, every day,

1063
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:52,660
and if a show like this can come along

1064
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:56,090
and it can make men like me
understand a little better

1065
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:58,190
what's going on with these women,

1066
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:00,354
then I say we should go ahead and do it.

1067
00:39:00,354 --> 00:39:03,400
I say it's worthwhile and I
think women will relate to it

1068
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,674
on a million levels.

1069
00:39:04,674 --> 00:39:07,841
(all talking at once)

1070
00:39:09,242 --> 00:39:11,030
- We're going ahead with this show.

1071
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:14,410
We need somebody to
co-produce it with her,

1072
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:17,400
somebody who has some has
some documentary experience.

1073
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,750
- Benny.
- Benny.

1074
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,620
- What, me, are you serious?

1075
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,762
- You're the guy.

1076
00:39:21,762 --> 00:39:23,120
- (scoffing) Are you joking?

1077
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,230
- I'm not joking, you're
gonna co-produce with Moxie.

1078
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,063
- Why me?

1079
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:26,896
- Why you?

1080
00:39:26,896 --> 00:39:27,950
I've seen your work, it's dynamite.

1081
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,290
- Thank you, I--
- You're great on location.

1082
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:30,510
You're great with remote, you're--

1083
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,810
- I very much appreciate that

1084
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:33,610
but I couldn't be the furthest choice

1085
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:34,528
from the right guy for this project.

1086
00:39:34,528 --> 00:39:36,851
- I think you have experience.

1087
00:39:36,851 --> 00:39:37,684
- I have nothing.

1088
00:39:37,684 --> 00:39:39,539
- You've got documentary
experience, you're the guy.

1089
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:42,920
- Listen, with all due respect,
I don't get it, okay, I--

1090
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,150
- With all due respect,
this is not a request, okay?

1091
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,270
Either you do it or you
can have your severance.

1092
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:50,230
I've seen your contract, you'll
be on immediate suspension.

1093
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,070
- Really, it's like that?

1094
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,350
Okay, all right, listen.

1095
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:54,902
- That said.
- Whatever you need.

1096
00:39:54,902 --> 00:39:55,974
- I want this--
- Whatever you need,

1097
00:39:55,974 --> 00:39:57,640
whatever you need.
- Okay, this I what I need.

1098
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,030
I need it to appeal to a
lot of different people.

1099
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,531
Not just older women, it
should appeal to husbands,

1100
00:40:01,531 --> 00:40:03,647
boyfriends, adult children,

1101
00:40:03,647 --> 00:40:04,660
you understand?

1102
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,417
It's gotta encompass much
more than just the women.

1103
00:40:06,417 --> 00:40:08,756
- How am I supposed to produce
something I got no heart for,

1104
00:40:08,756 --> 00:40:10,560
that's what I'm asking you,
I have no heart for it.

1105
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,430
- I have a lot of faith in you, my friend.

1106
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,279
Moxie!

1107
00:40:13,279 --> 00:40:14,779
- Appreciate that.

1108
00:40:16,516 --> 00:40:18,016
"The M Word" is a green light.

1109
00:40:19,008 --> 00:40:21,204
(laughing)

1110
00:40:21,204 --> 00:40:23,394
(clapping)

1111
00:40:23,394 --> 00:40:24,477
- Yeah, baby.

1112
00:40:25,498 --> 00:40:27,270
- Thank you.

1113
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:28,857
- Benny will be co-producing with you.

1114
00:40:28,857 --> 00:40:31,200
I'm gonna start you on a
very low budget, you know,

1115
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,670
you're gonna have to cut corners

1116
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,140
and make it work on the fly.

1117
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,680
- Wait a second, Benny?

1118
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,390
- Benny's gonna be your
co-producer, he's got--

1119
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:40,020
- Benny can't do a show
on menopause. (laughing)

1120
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,899
- I'm your new partner, we're excited.

1121
00:40:41,899 --> 00:40:44,070
- He says, "Jesus Christ"
every time I say menopause.

1122
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:46,020
He can't do a show on menopause.

1123
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,920
- We need a man to balance it out.

1124
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,080
- Why?

1125
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,910
- [Charlie] He's got
documentary experience.

1126
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:51,743
- But he can't--

1127
00:40:51,743 --> 00:40:53,409
- You're the imagination.
- He has no female exper--

1128
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,577
- He's the nuts and bolts.

1129
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,097
- Moxie, I'm here for you, okay?

1130
00:40:56,097 --> 00:40:56,930
- I have a vision for this.

1131
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:58,377
- He won't even come around the house

1132
00:40:58,377 --> 00:40:59,600
when I have my period, okay?

1133
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,713
- Well, he's gonna have to because

1134
00:41:00,713 --> 00:41:02,583
he's gonna be getting paid to do it.

1135
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,473
- Honestly, Moxie.

1136
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,300
I can't think of anything

1137
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,818
I'd rather talk about less than menopause.

1138
00:41:14,818 --> 00:41:17,365
- Well, technically, I'm
in perimenopause as well.

1139
00:41:17,365 --> 00:41:21,100
I still get my period and instead of like,

1140
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,830
some women get their
period less often and then

1141
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:26,510
they skip a month and
then they skip two months,

1142
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:28,920
I'm getting my period every three weeks.

1143
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,430
- I'm a monster, I scare myself,

1144
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:33,840
I don't know who I am
and I can't control it.

1145
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,840
- Right now, I'm trying
to balance estrogen

1146
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,740
and progesterone and testosterone,

1147
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,140
which I didn't even know I had.

1148
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,370
- My PMS is way worse than it used to be,

1149
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:46,370
so every two weeks, I'm
feeling PMSy so I'm prickly

1150
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:50,680
and irritable and just
bloaty and craving chocolate,

1151
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,950
chocolate, anything chocolate.

1152
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:54,060
- I don't wanna get old,
I don't wanna get older.

1153
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,990
I wish I could just stop right now.

1154
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:59,860
- Menopause is affecting
the whole change in my life

1155
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:03,080
and the redefining of myself
and I feel very trapped.

1156
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,887
- The only single reason
Duncan had to die in "Macbeth"

1157
00:42:06,887 --> 00:42:09,728
was because Lady Macbeth
was going through menopause.

1158
00:42:09,728 --> 00:42:11,070
(laughing)

1159
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:11,903
For real.

1160
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,834
- It's pretty much as we suspected, yeah,

1161
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:20,530
major stagnation, but there's
three shows that have to go,

1162
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:23,413
no doubt, and, yeah, I'm dealing with it.

1163
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:29,140
Uh-huh, but there is one young
woman, an actress, producer,

1164
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,600
very bright, very
talented and I think she's

1165
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,220
got a lot of potential so I'm...

1166
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,053
No.

1167
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:39,577
I'm dealing with her
about a future project

1168
00:42:39,577 --> 00:42:41,290
that seems like it could be

1169
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:43,760
very profitable for this channel.

1170
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,390
- What does it feel like,
how you feel inside?

1171
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:51,390
- To me, it's like an ending
of the life that I knew.

1172
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,110
I used to love flaunting my body.

1173
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:58,703
I used to love always
being looked at by men.

1174
00:42:58,703 --> 00:43:03,027
- I worry what if I'm not as
moist as I always used to be?

1175
00:43:03,027 --> 00:43:05,836
And how does that affect,
and I still feel like I am

1176
00:43:05,836 --> 00:43:07,810
but I don't know if that's gonna last.

1177
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:11,350
- I just can't believe that
this is my girl talk now.

1178
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:13,780
- You notice women in their
50s, 60s going to yoga.

1179
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,950
Everyone's trying to
find their spirituality.

1180
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:18,780
- I definitely dread and fear menopause.

1181
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:21,459
I mean, they say it's, like,
100 times worse than PMS

1182
00:43:21,459 --> 00:43:24,110
and I can barely get
through PMS each month.

1183
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:27,790
- I will not miss my period, never.

1184
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:29,380
(strumming ukulele)

1185
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:31,090
- [Moxie] Hey, J.

1186
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:32,582
- Hey, Moxie.

1187
00:43:32,582 --> 00:43:34,860
- You're getting good at that.

1188
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,520
- Practicing, don't tell anybody else,

1189
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,512
supposed to be working.

1190
00:43:37,512 --> 00:43:39,173
- I promise you.

1191
00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:43,993
So, you've known me for
a little bit, right?

1192
00:43:43,993 --> 00:43:44,826
- Yeah.

1193
00:43:44,826 --> 00:43:47,575
- We're doing guy-to-guy thing.

1194
00:43:47,575 --> 00:43:48,533
- We're homes.

1195
00:43:48,533 --> 00:43:50,410
- We're homes, homies.

1196
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:54,980
Um, okay, so what do you think of Charlie?

1197
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:58,440
- Mr. Moon?

1198
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,991
- Mr. Moon, yeah.

1199
00:43:59,991 --> 00:44:01,240
- (laughing) Shut up.

1200
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,058
- 'Cause, you know, he asked
me out to go to coffee.

1201
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,724
- Oh, he did?
- I know it's like a workday.

1202
00:44:05,724 --> 00:44:06,803
- Oh, oh!
- No, shut up, shut up.

1203
00:44:06,803 --> 00:44:08,621
- Oh, Moxie!
- Shut up, shut up, shut up.

1204
00:44:08,621 --> 00:44:09,579
- Charlie!

1205
00:44:09,579 --> 00:44:12,090
- Shut up, that's not cool,

1206
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:13,300
that's so not cool.
- I know, sorry.

1207
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,133
- Come on.

1208
00:44:14,133 --> 00:44:15,147
- Sorry.

1209
00:44:15,147 --> 00:44:16,770
= He's asked me to go to
coffee, it's like a work thing,

1210
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:19,740
but, you know, I can't talk
to any of the other guys here

1211
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,637
'cause they're gonna be stupid about it

1212
00:44:21,637 --> 00:44:24,220
and I just wanna know
what you think of, like.

1213
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,950
- I mean if you're asking me
if I think he's attractive,

1214
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:26,783
I can't really--

1215
00:44:26,783 --> 00:44:28,150
- No, I don't want you to
say if he's attractive.

1216
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:31,790
I just want, ou tell me
what you think of him.

1217
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:32,940
- The truth?
- Mm-hmm.

1218
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,850
- He seemed a little fishy.

1219
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:44,143
- [Charlie] I just want you to know I'm

1220
00:44:44,143 --> 00:44:45,720
going out on a limb for you, all right?

1221
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,485
And there's a price you
have to pay for that.

1222
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:49,980
(Moxie laughing)

1223
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:50,813
- Look.

1224
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:51,987
- You understand that, right?

1225
00:44:51,987 --> 00:44:54,668
- Charles, you're very
attractive, I'm not--

1226
00:44:54,668 --> 00:44:55,700
- I don't mean that, I don't mean that.

1227
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,610
You think I'm a sleazebag, don't you?

1228
00:44:57,610 --> 00:44:58,443
- Little bit.

1229
00:44:58,443 --> 00:45:00,197
- No, no, no, no, I'm not telling New York

1230
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,933
about the menopause thing.

1231
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:03,050
- Why?
- At least not now,

1232
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:05,080
because I don't want them
starting to, you know,

1233
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,774
nose around and they might
send somebody out here,

1234
00:45:06,774 --> 00:45:09,300
okay, it's gonna be--

1235
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,515
- Wait, is there something
illegitimate about doing that?

1236
00:45:11,515 --> 00:45:13,962
- No, no, no, no, I just don't want them

1237
00:45:13,962 --> 00:45:16,002
to start putting their fingers in the pie.

1238
00:45:16,002 --> 00:45:18,280
You're gonna be responsible for it.

1239
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,650
You're gonna have hardly any budget,

1240
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,564
which is one of the attractive
things about it, but...

1241
00:45:21,564 --> 00:45:22,397
- I don't mind.

1242
00:45:22,397 --> 00:45:24,000
- It's all on your shoulders, okay?

1243
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:24,833
- Okay.

1244
00:45:24,833 --> 00:45:26,220
- I have nothing to do with
it, my name's not on it.

1245
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,666
Nobody knows I've even been
near it, you understand?

1246
00:45:28,666 --> 00:45:32,213
So if it doesn't work, you take the fall.

1247
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,667
You understand, I'm a gambler
who likes to cover his--

1248
00:45:34,667 --> 00:45:36,430
- But if it does work.

1249
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:37,846
- If it does work, if you win, I win,

1250
00:45:37,846 --> 00:45:39,903
you understand, and if you win,

1251
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:43,600
I want two more shows, okay?

1252
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,580
Women's stuff, new stuff, different stuff.

1253
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:46,600
You understand?

1254
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,433
- Yeah.

1255
00:45:47,433 --> 00:45:48,650
- Is that a deal?
- Deal.

1256
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:50,460
- [Charlie] Charles Robert Moneta Jr.,

1257
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,356
pleasure to meet you.

1258
00:45:51,356 --> 00:45:53,473
- Moneta?
- Moneta.

1259
00:45:53,473 --> 00:45:55,591
- Moneta.
- Mm-hmm.

1260
00:45:55,591 --> 00:45:56,424
You like that?

1261
00:45:56,424 --> 00:45:57,755
- Moneta is very hot.

1262
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,170
- It's hot, isn't it?

1263
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:01,263
- That's very sexy, why'd you change it?

1264
00:46:01,263 --> 00:46:02,501
- I didn't change it.

1265
00:46:02,501 --> 00:46:04,196
- Who changed it?

1266
00:46:04,196 --> 00:46:06,727
- Well--
- You don't know?

1267
00:46:06,727 --> 00:46:09,410
- No, in school that's what
they started to call me,

1268
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:13,129
Charlie Moon, Moonie,
Moon, kinda, you know,

1269
00:46:13,129 --> 00:46:17,180
and then I got my first job.

1270
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:18,350
- Can we go for a walk?

1271
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:20,460
- A walk, what do you think I am?

1272
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:24,097
- Let's go, come on, let's go.

1273
00:46:24,097 --> 00:46:26,110
- All right, come on.

1274
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:27,675
- What are you thinking?

1275
00:46:27,675 --> 00:46:29,577
- What's the deal with Benny?

1276
00:46:29,577 --> 00:46:30,993
- Benny?
- Yeah.

1277
00:46:30,993 --> 00:46:32,850
Honestly.

1278
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:36,140
- Benny is, honestly?
- Yeah.

1279
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:38,630
- As long as he fits into my schedule and

1280
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:41,530
I don't mind who else, what's going on--

1281
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:43,140
- So it's a thing of convenience.

1282
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:46,033
- Yeah, my thing is my career.

1283
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:49,160
I don't know, there's not,

1284
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,944
I don't, why are you asking me?

1285
00:46:51,944 --> 00:46:53,928
- Why do you think I'm
asking you, 'cause--

1286
00:46:53,928 --> 00:46:56,020
I don't know.
- I have a vested interest in

1287
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:57,510
the answer to this question.
- A vested interest?

1288
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:58,940
- Yes, now I do.

1289
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,702
- How much of a vested interest?

1290
00:47:00,702 --> 00:47:01,535
- You know, I don't want to be, you know,

1291
00:47:01,535 --> 00:47:03,736
I don't wanna be led on,
you know what I mean?

1292
00:47:03,736 --> 00:47:04,569
- Oh.

1293
00:47:04,569 --> 00:47:05,600
- You understand, right?

1294
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,541
I'm not that kind of girl.
- I wasn't leading you on.

1295
00:47:08,541 --> 00:47:09,374
- You understand?

1296
00:47:09,374 --> 00:47:10,640
- I know,

1297
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,283
I'm sorry if it hurt before.

1310

Being with you in this place.
- Just now?

1311
00:48:18,747 --> 00:48:20,616
For 72 hours?
- Looking at the sunset.

1314
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:24,230
I don't wanna think about
that, you know what?

1315

The future doesn't
exist, the past is gone.

1316

All we have is now, right,
so why not, like, keep it?

1317
00:48:29,052 --> 00:48:31,450

that anymore in my life.

- What, the now, what do--

1319
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,507
- I don't want the "let's
just hang out now" thing.

1320
00:48:36,507 --> 00:48:37,663
I don't want that.

1321
00:48:38,567 --> 00:48:41,620
I don't want it with you,
I feel too much here.

1322
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,250
I feel way too much.

1323
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:44,250

1324
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:46,660
You really feel that?

1325
00:48:49,505 --> 00:48:50,891
- And if you don't at least--

1326
00:48:50,891 --> 00:48:52,215
- I didn't say I don't.

1327
00:48:52,215 --> 00:48:53,510
- At least--
- You know I feel something.

1328
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:58,063
You know I feel a lot, you know
I feel the magic, the spark.

1329
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:03,720

feel a fucking inferno here.

I'm totally embracing it,

1334
00:49:21,678 --> 00:49:23,638
I think I'm having a hot flash right now.

1335
00:49:23,638 --> 00:49:25,338
(laughing)

1336
00:49:25,338 --> 00:49:28,680
But I, am I sweating, yeah.

1337
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,587
- What I'm really afraid of
is not the physical thing,

1338
00:49:31,587 --> 00:49:35,090
the hot flashes and all of
that but the hereditary,

1339
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:39,080
psychological components where
I will wanna be on my own

1340
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,850
and not with men and I really,

1341
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:42,760
really don't wanna turn into my mother.

1342
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:45,600
- But I was so sad because
Aunt Flo, I call her,

1343
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,200
and she, I loved her. (laughing)

1344
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,190
With her suitcases and with
her, all of her luggage,

1345
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:54,230
whether it was, however
she came, I loved her,

1346
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:56,060
and then she left and it was really sad.

1347
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:59,010
- Can we talk about sex, is
it okay to talk about sex?

1348
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:00,910
Okay. (laughing)

1349
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:03,400
Well, so, for the past four years,

1350
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,160
and I mean four full years,

1351
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:09,120
I've had no interest
whatsoever in sex, none, okay?

1352
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:13,070
I mean, it's so bad that Alec
Baldwin and George Clooney,

1353
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:16,084
they still show up in my
dreams but now we just chat.

1354
00:50:16,084 --> 00:50:17,940
(women laughing)

1355
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:18,773
Seriously.

1356
00:50:18,773 --> 00:50:23,010
- I feel like I'm Harold Lloyd, you know,

1357
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:27,880
on the big face clock, like,
desperately holding on.

1358
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,107
- I'm just reaching the end of the tunnel

1359
00:50:30,107 --> 00:50:33,470
and I can see no way of getting out of it.

1360
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:36,540
- It's a process of dying,
we're getting closer to dying

1361
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:39,070
and that's the horrifying
fact of the whole thing.

1362
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:40,906
- [Woman] I feel more
alive than I've ever felt.

1363
00:50:40,906 --> 00:50:43,390
- The dawn is, what is it?

1364
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:45,833
There's the light, before
it's dark, it's the lightest.

1365
00:50:45,833 --> 00:50:47,470
- [Woman] Dawn is before the dark?

1366
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:48,780
- Bingo.

1367
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,070
- So what can I do for you, Benny?

1368
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:51,380
- What can I do for you?

1369
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:53,010
I think that's what
we're talking about here.

1370
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:55,783
How can I best serve you,
because I know that you're

1371
00:50:55,783 --> 00:50:58,620
not just here to bust balls,
you're here to make choices

1372
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,110
and they're hard choices.

1373
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:01,290
I wanna help you make those choices.

1374
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:03,580
- Who told you I'm here to make choices?

1375
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:06,180
- Come on, it's not my
first day at the ballpark.

1376
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:07,267
You know what I mean, you come down here.

1377
00:51:07,267 --> 00:51:09,140
You gotta make decisions.

1378
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:12,083
I've been running the numbers
and I put together a file

1379
00:51:12,083 --> 00:51:13,573
full of all the research
that I've been doing.

1380
00:51:13,573 --> 00:51:16,084
I'm trying to help you out
so you have bird's eye view

1381
00:51:16,084 --> 00:51:18,220
of everything at the station.

1382
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:19,550
- What kind of research were you doing?

1383
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:20,710
- I've been doing TV Qs,

1384
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:23,205
I've been looking where our
highest profit shares are,

1385
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:24,801
our audience base--

1386
00:51:24,801 --> 00:51:26,500
- I have all those numbers already.

1387
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,040
I got those numbers before
I even got out here.

1388
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,389
- What you don't have is
you don't have the personal

1389
00:51:30,389 --> 00:51:33,420
hands-on effect with each person.

1390
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:35,300
You don't have your finger on the pulse

1391
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,400
of what's happening here--

1392
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,233
- And you do?

1393
00:51:37,233 --> 00:51:38,066
- Absolutely.

1394
00:51:38,066 --> 00:51:40,850
I'm here day in and day
out, this is my life.

1395
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:43,460
- Could you set up through
the computer system here

1396
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:47,990
a way of monitoring what people do

1397
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:49,980
on their individual terminals here?

1398
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:52,150
- We're talking about--
- Hacking into their--

1399
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:54,600
- Not hacking, I don't
wanna get into what they do

1400
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,240
when they're home or
on their personal time,

1401
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,073
but what goes on at work--

1402
00:51:57,073 --> 00:51:59,470
- But, wait, are you
talking about looking into

1403
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:01,570
people's business online
or are you talking about

1404
00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:03,560
physically monitoring the building?

1405
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:06,034
- I wanna see how things are dealt with

1406
00:52:06,034 --> 00:52:09,020
on a day-to-day basis
in terms of accounts,

1407
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:11,580
in terms of revenue, in terms of flow,

1408
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:13,950
flow charts and all those things.

1409
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:17,753
- Well, look, if you wanna
set up a monitoring system

1410
00:52:17,753 --> 00:52:19,810
throughout the company,
every time somebody

1411
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:22,600
logs onto the internet, we could
monitor what they're doing,

1412
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,630
whether it is watching
porn or stealing money--

1413
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:26,470
- Now, why don't we have
that in place already?

1414
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:28,571
- I could set up anything
you want on here.

1415
00:52:28,571 --> 00:52:30,370
If it's on these computers,

1416
00:52:30,370 --> 00:52:33,300
we'll find out whatever it may be.

1417
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,380
- Listen, let's keep this
between the three of us.

1418
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:38,520
- Holy crap, this just gave
me an unbelievable idea.

1419
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,370
We wire up a couple web cams, all right?

1420
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:43,310
Wire up just a few, we can test it through

1421
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:47,102
any remote location to link
the viewer to the content,

1422
00:52:47,102 --> 00:52:49,260
the content to the viewer--

1423
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:50,440
- But I don't want any viewers--

1424
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,090
- No, I know, we're gonna
give you what you want.

1425
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:53,366
We're gonna give you what you want.

1426
00:52:53,366 --> 00:52:54,720
- Charlie, you know every
journey of a thousand miles

1427
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,240
begins with one step, Mr. Moon.

1428
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,105
- That's true, very true.

1429
00:52:59,105 --> 00:53:01,938
(energetic music)

1430
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:46,870
(birds chirping)

1431
00:53:46,870 --> 00:53:48,000
- [Rich] So you're telling me we can look

1432
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,530
anywhere in the studio we want?

1433
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:51,223
- That's the beauty of it.
- Anywhere?

1434
00:53:51,223 --> 00:53:52,056
- Anywhere.

1435
00:53:52,056 --> 00:53:53,937
I could put 'em in the
bathroom if you really want to.

1436
00:53:53,937 --> 00:53:55,580
- No, don't do that, that's crazy.

1437
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:56,953
Did you put it in the studio?

1438
00:53:56,953 --> 00:53:59,450
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

1439
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:00,470
- When we shot a show?
- Yeah.

1440
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:02,270
- Do you have me doing Mrs. Goldenrod?

1441
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:03,493
- I think so, unfortunately

1442
00:54:03,493 --> 00:54:05,241
- Really? You show
Moxie any of this stuff?

1443
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:06,074
- No, no, no, not yet.

1444
00:54:06,074 --> 00:54:06,983
- So she has no idea?

1445
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:13,390
Crenshaw, all the kids out
there are looking forward

1446
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:15,540
to your appearance here on the show and,

1447
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:17,393
please, say hello to them.

1448
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,950
- Go ahead, Crenshaw, say hello.

1449
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:21,732
- You kids see a crab in the ocean,

1450
00:54:21,732 --> 00:54:25,340
I want you to make sure
you leave that crab alone,

1451
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:26,173
you don't touch him.

1452
00:54:26,173 --> 00:54:27,620
You don't look at him,

1453
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:29,230
you don't even bother him,

1454
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:32,200
except maybe to throw
a potato chip his way

1455
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,878
'cause, listen, that crab is
probably doing something fun.

1456
00:54:35,878 --> 00:54:38,944
He's just trying to get
some sun or he's just trying

1457
00:54:38,944 --> 00:54:43,944
to check out another crab but
it's none of your business

1458
00:54:44,215 --> 00:54:47,867
what that crab's doing with his life.

1459
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:48,700
- Now--

1460
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:52,017
- Like this chick here had
no business catching me.

1461
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:56,510
- But I had a net and so I scooped her up.

1462
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:58,050
- I'm sorry to put you in this position,

1463
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:00,630
but you're in charge here.

1464
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,320
- What's the big megillah?

1465
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,240
- It's a really big
megillah, unfortunately.

1466
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,940
It's King Kong, there is
a huge amount of money

1467
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,100
missing from the accounts,

1468
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:12,704
there's been embezzlement at this station.

1469
00:55:12,704 --> 00:55:13,700
- Do you know--

1470
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:14,986
You have a number?

1471
00:55:14,986 --> 00:55:16,600
- This much.

1472
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,070
- Big, big money.

1473
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:19,190
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1474
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,760
- This much.
- Um.

1475
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,710
You know, I'm going to
come around and say it.

1476
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:23,543
What are we gonna do?

1477
00:55:23,543 --> 00:55:25,270
What do you suggest we do?

1478
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:26,540
How do we put an end to this?

1479
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:27,373
- [Doug] Uh, well...

1480
00:55:27,373 --> 00:55:28,206
(chuckling)

1481
00:55:28,206 --> 00:55:29,710
- Somebody's gonna have to take the fall

1482
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:32,440
and I don't want it to be you.

1483
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:33,990
- We've gotta be proactive.

1484
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:36,310
Each one of you has a
department and you have

1485
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:38,230
a lot of people in it and you're

1486
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:39,340
familiar with these people.

1487
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:43,180
I want you to see if there's
anything suspicious going on.

1488
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:45,560
- How many of us could be the person?

1489
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:46,540
How many?

1490
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:47,373
- [Doug] One?

1491
00:55:47,373 --> 00:55:48,230
- Here's four.
- What are you thinking?

1492
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:49,726
- How do we know there's even a person?

1493
00:55:49,726 --> 00:55:51,052
How do we know there's even a person?

1494
00:55:51,052 --> 00:55:54,955
These guys come in here, they
interrogate the whole group,

1495
00:55:54,955 --> 00:55:58,948
they make accusations out of
the blue, do you what they--

1496
00:55:58,948 --> 00:56:00,708
- [Sherry] Look, I think
that we have to stay calm.

1497
00:56:00,708 --> 00:56:02,022
- Wait a minute, wait a
minute, let me say this.

1498
00:56:02,022 --> 00:56:03,960
- The fact is, money is missing.

1499
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,640
- I know it was upsetting.

1500
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:06,953
- You know the other night,

1501
00:56:06,953 --> 00:56:08,090
you and I were over here in the meeting,

1502
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:09,390
we both had scotch, right?

1503
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:11,328
We both had a little glass
of scotch, we do this--

1504
00:56:11,328 --> 00:56:12,660
- What does that have to
do with it? (laughing)

1505
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,342
- Because I got accosted
by this Charlie Moon--

1506
00:56:15,342 --> 00:56:16,175
- Oh, no.

1507
00:56:16,175 --> 00:56:18,117
- Telling me that he
was concerned that I got

1508
00:56:18,117 --> 00:56:20,530
some kind of problem with alcohol.

1509
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:21,363
- Oh, come on.

1510
00:56:21,363 --> 00:56:23,491
- It came to our attention
that you had gone for help,

1511
00:56:23,491 --> 00:56:26,540
for rehabilitation, what was the place?

1512
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:27,849
Sandy Pines.

1513
00:56:27,849 --> 00:56:29,810
Was that it, Sandy Pines?

1514
00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:32,273
- Yeah, that was the name of
it. And how long, was it a,

1515
00:56:32,273 --> 00:56:35,150
I'm assuming it was not
successful, the treatment.

1516
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:37,599
- I think it was very successful.

1517
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:39,133
I'm doing fine.

1518
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:42,397
I'm doing fine.

1519
00:56:42,397 --> 00:56:44,380
- But it happened to me too.

1520
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:45,790
- Heads are gonna roll.

1521
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:48,320
- Well, they should roll
if somebody's taking money.

1522
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,030
- I know none of you guys have done this.

1523
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:53,280
- Is there anybody else
but those of us on the team

1524
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,493
that could have done this?

1525
00:56:54,493 --> 00:56:55,630
- We can't imagine.
- That had access?

1526
00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:57,080
- We can't imagine who did this.

1527
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,648
- There's cover-ups.

1528
00:56:58,648 --> 00:57:01,100
I don't want you to be dragged into that.

1529
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:03,954
Now, what I'm gonna ask
you very honestly is,

1530
00:57:03,954 --> 00:57:07,139
what shell should we be looking under?

1531
00:57:07,139 --> 00:57:10,930
- Oh, I can't, I don't
know of any shells, honey,

1532
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:12,720
that you should be looking under, really.

1533
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,720
I have no clue what's going on.

1534
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,090
- I've only been here eight months

1535
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:21,525
and I'm trying to just keep my nose clean.

1536
00:57:21,525 --> 00:57:22,900
- You know, you guys have been here

1537
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,730
and it's been putting us a little on edge.

1538
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:29,730
- Who in this organization
here are you concerned about,

1539
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:31,200
if you know what I mean?

1540
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,950
- Well, I would say the younger women,

1541
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,310
anybody's who's younger,
not going through menopause,

1542
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:36,460
doesn't have children.

1543
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:39,370
- Have you ever been
approached by a sponsor

1544
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:40,860
with the offer of a kickback?

1545
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:44,640
- I check copy, I'm a
writer, so I'm copywriter.

1546
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:45,680
- [Harry] A copywriter.

1547
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:46,990
- How long have you worked here?

1548
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:50,540
- I'm in recovery, so
I'm completely sober now.

1549
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:52,760
- Money's been embezzled,
it's not just missing.

1550
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:53,593
You know what I mean?

1551
00:57:53,593 --> 00:57:55,490
- And what, what could I possibly know?

1552
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:57,270
I don't touch the money, you know that.

1553
00:57:57,270 --> 00:58:01,300
- And you're the production
intern and your specialty is?

1554
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,782
- Information technology.

1555
00:58:02,782 --> 00:58:05,069
- Information technology,
and that has to do mainly

1556
00:58:05,069 --> 00:58:06,594
with computers, correct?

1557
00:58:06,594 --> 00:58:07,890
- Yeah.

1558
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:09,262
- Is there something you need to tell us?

1559
00:58:09,262 --> 00:58:11,150
- Is there something you need to hear?

1560
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:13,420
- I'm asking for your help,

1561
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:15,680
someone who has a perspective of

1562
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,176
two different vantage points, creative,

1563
00:58:18,176 --> 00:58:20,553
in front of the camera, behind the camera,

1564
00:58:20,553 --> 00:58:22,160
behind the computer.

1565
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:25,340
- You're suggesting that
would be me as someone?

1566
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:27,590
I play a woman--
- Brilliantly.

1567
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:30,110
- Thank you, Mr. Moon, but the reality is

1568
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:32,710
I'm a 44-year-old actor.

1569
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:36,990
- Um, unfortunately, with what's going on,

1570
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:38,853
the research that Harry's been doing,

1571
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:42,483
I don't know if you'll
be on the air next week.

1572
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:48,870
- Did he ask you anything
about the business

1573
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:49,703
or anything like that?

1574
00:58:49,703 --> 00:58:51,720
- No, no, he was just
asking me these abstract,

1575
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:52,870
intellectual questions.

1576
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:54,050
- And that was your conversation?

1577
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:54,920
- That's right.

1578
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,127
- I saw you talking to him.

1579
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,100
- Why are you so interested?

1580
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,847
Well, you're talking to me, you know,

1581
00:58:58,847 --> 00:59:00,685
you're talking about space.

1582
00:59:00,685 --> 00:59:03,260
- I wouldn't talk about
those subjects to you.

1583
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:04,636
It would be kind of pointless.

1584
00:59:04,636 --> 00:59:05,710
- Well.

1585
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:07,620
- If you knew of something
was going on around here

1586
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:12,080
that was maybe shady,
who would you talk to?

1587
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,110
- I feel like you want me to say you.

1588
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:15,460
- I would like to think that if there was

1589
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:18,553
something going on that
was a little unscrupulous,

1590
00:59:18,553 --> 00:59:22,030
that you would feel that
you had a comfort zone,

1591
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:23,426
that you could come talk
to me and you'd be okay.

1592
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:24,860
- Sure.

1593
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:28,410
What if you heard something
unscrupulous, so to speak,

1594
00:59:28,410 --> 00:59:30,380
I mean, would you come to me?

1595
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:32,560
- I would like to think that
I could trust you, yeah.

1596
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,410
- So come to me, what have you heard?

1597
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:38,540
- Can you give me a minute?

1598
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:39,373
- [Harry] Absolutely.

1599
00:59:39,373 --> 00:59:41,050
- We're good here as far
as the other thing goes.

1600
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:42,100
Don't worry.
- Okay.

1601
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:52,230
- Okay, what's wrong?

1602
00:59:57,681 --> 01:00:00,109
What is it, are you mad at me?

1603
01:00:00,109 --> 01:00:01,151
- What are you doing?

1604
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:01,984
- What?

1605
01:00:01,984 --> 01:00:02,817
- What is all this?

1606
01:00:02,817 --> 01:00:06,455
This is like a crazy
dog-and-pony show on acid.

1607
01:00:06,455 --> 01:00:08,958
- It's not a dog-and-pony show

1608
01:00:08,958 --> 01:00:11,932
- You two are like little
kindergartners running around.

1609
01:00:11,932 --> 01:00:13,140
- Something is going on.

1610
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:15,231
We're not kindergartners,
something's going on here

1611
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:17,431
and we're trying to get
to the bottom of it.

1612
01:00:19,562 --> 01:00:22,660
And you don't have any idea?

1613
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,550
- Hmm?
- Mm-mm.

1614
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:25,383
- Leave it open.

1615
01:00:25,383 --> 01:00:26,613
I don't like this, I don't
like it closed like that?

1616
01:00:27,813 --> 01:00:28,646
- Why?

1617
01:00:29,512 --> 01:00:30,345
Why?

1618
01:00:30,345 --> 01:00:31,687
- 'Cause I can't see your pretty mouth.

1619
01:00:31,687 --> 01:00:32,520
- Why?

1620
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:33,843
- I wanna see it.

1621
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:46,510
- Well, it's time for
us to sign off from KZAM

1622
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:49,763
and send Priscilla back
to her cage in Cincinnati.

1623
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:52,340
- Oh, are we done?

1624
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:55,250
Shoot, I was just going to tell them

1625
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:56,902
where the bodies were buried.

1626
01:00:56,902 --> 01:00:59,250
- Oh, oh, bodies?

1627
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:01,723
- Should I tell them where
you buried the bodies?

1628
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:06,320
She hacked them up, she buried them up

1629
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,433
and fed them to the cougars.

1630
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:10,765
- Want a cracker?

1631
01:01:10,765 --> 01:01:11,983
- I don't want a cracker.

1632
01:01:11,983 --> 01:01:15,073
I wanna tell them where the bodies are.

1633
01:01:15,073 --> 01:01:16,500
- We don't know what she's talking--

1634
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:17,821
- I think it's time for this bird to go.

1635
01:01:17,821 --> 01:01:18,910
- Clean up the blood,

1636
01:01:18,910 --> 01:01:20,260
clean up the blood, Priscilla.

1637
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:21,410
Clean up the blood, Priscilla,

1638
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:22,350
clean up the blood, Priscilla.

1639
01:01:22,350 --> 01:01:24,593
Clean it up, clean it up, Priscilla!

1640
01:01:24,593 --> 01:01:27,474
Clean up the blood,
Priscilla, it's a secret,

1641
01:01:27,474 --> 01:01:29,950
it's a secret, it's a secret!

1642
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:31,958
- What's a secret?
- Tax evasion, tax evasion!

1643
01:01:31,958 --> 01:01:34,291
(chuckling)

1644
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:43,950
- My mother used to talk
about the tonic with my aunts.

1645
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,530
They used to take the tonic,

1646
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:46,890
could have been scotch for all I know

1647
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:48,240
that they talking about.

1648
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:51,820
- My mother went from
being what seemed like,

1649
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:54,850
I don't know, size 12 to, like, a size 18

1650
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:57,580
and she really pride
herself on her beauty.

1651
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:01,112
- My mother's mother and her
aunts and her older sisters

1652
01:02:01,112 --> 01:02:04,760
all told her to grin and bear it.

1653
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:07,840
- My mother left my father when she was 50

1654
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:08,700
and going through it.

1655
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:10,160
- My own mother doesn't even know

1656
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,460
when she went through menopause,

1657
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:13,680
she doesn't have that to
share with her daughters.

1658
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:14,920
- I said to my mother,
"Did you go through."

1659
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:15,753
Like, "What happened when

1660
01:02:15,753 --> 01:02:16,586
"you went through menopause?"

1661
01:02:16,586 --> 01:02:17,640
She goes, "I got a little warm."

1662
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,760
- My mother always loved to cook,

1663
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:22,770
and then she got in this
spell where she couldn't

1664
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:25,020
stand to be in the kitchen because it was

1665
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:26,590
hot all the time.

1666
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:29,940
- My mother kind of took a
permanent pause from men.

1667
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:31,870
- My father, being a southern man,

1668
01:02:31,870 --> 01:02:35,290
decided if his wife couldn't cook,

1669
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:37,163
he was going to get a divorce.

1670
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:40,250
- [Charlie] There she is.

1671
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:41,083
- Hi.

1672
01:02:41,083 --> 01:02:42,340
- How are you?

1673
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:44,110
- What you doing here?

1674
01:02:44,110 --> 01:02:45,050
Where is everybody?

1675
01:02:45,050 --> 01:02:46,981
- Uh, I dismissed them.

1676
01:02:46,981 --> 01:02:49,013
- You dismissed them?

1677
01:02:49,013 --> 01:02:51,730
- I dismissed everybody because I wanted

1678
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:53,018
to have a word with you first.

1679
01:02:53,018 --> 01:02:54,410
- But we're supposed
to shoot the show now.

1680
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:59,050
- Yeah, well, um, you
now have all your time

1681
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:02,020
to focus on the menopause documentary.

1682
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:03,825
By the way, I put out some feelers--

1683
01:03:03,825 --> 01:03:04,810
- I mean, I'm so excited about that.

1684
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:06,830
- No, yeah, I put out some
feelers to some people

1685
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:09,370
I really trust, they think
it's a really great idea.

1686
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:12,523
They got really excited about
it and now I'm excited, so.

1687
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:15,413
- We're happy.
- That's what I want you

1688
01:03:15,413 --> 01:03:16,920
to focus your energy on.

1689
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:19,170
I had a whole Moxie film
festival last night.

1690
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,690
- You did?
- I watched six episodes.

1691
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:22,747
And you are brilliant.

1692
01:03:22,747 --> 01:03:24,910
- I am not brilliant.
- You're an extremely

1693
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:27,380
talented woman and you're
a very great artist.

1694
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:28,851
I mean that from the bottom of my heart.

1695
01:03:28,851 --> 01:03:30,470
- Really?

1696
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:31,303
- Absolutely.

1697
01:03:31,303 --> 01:03:32,723
- That's very sweet.

1698
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:38,610
- That said, um, unfortunately,
"Mrs. Goldenberg's Roundup"

1699
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:40,144
is one of the shows we're
going to have to let go

1700
01:03:40,144 --> 01:03:43,340
based on the surveys.

1701
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:45,290
It's got a small popular following

1702
01:03:45,290 --> 01:03:47,610
but it's been steadily diminishing

1703
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:49,760
and the numbers just
don't hold up anymore.

1704
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,453
- Mrs. Goldenrod.

1705
01:03:51,453 --> 01:03:53,593
- Listen--
- It's not Mrs. Goldenberg.

1706
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:57,700
Uh, that's about nine jobs right there

1707
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:00,690
that you're just putting in the trash can.

1708
01:04:00,690 --> 01:04:02,736
- That's an unfortunate
thing, but that's reality.

1709
01:04:02,736 --> 01:04:03,772
- That's reality?

1710
01:04:03,772 --> 01:04:05,180
- The numbers are the
numbers are the numbers,

1711
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:06,579
that's what I hear day and night.

1712
01:04:06,579 --> 01:04:07,412
- But that's Richie's life.

1713
01:04:07,412 --> 01:04:08,245
- That's Richie's life.

1714
01:04:08,245 --> 01:04:10,290
But Richie's going to get
another job, this is Hollywood.

1715
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:12,010
I'm sure there's tons of
places he can go and work.

1716
01:04:12,010 --> 01:04:15,003
- No, this is Hollywood,
everybody's out of work here.

1717
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:17,809
Wait a minute.

1718
01:04:17,809 --> 01:04:20,030
- If the numbers were supporting things,

1719
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:22,127
this show would run forever
as far as I'm concerned.

1720
01:04:22,127 --> 01:04:23,070
- Numbers, but what about--

1721
01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:24,310
- It's the numbers and the wallets

1722
01:04:24,310 --> 01:04:25,930
that support those numbers.
- No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1723
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:26,763
- That's just how it is.

1724
01:04:26,763 --> 01:04:27,727
That's how those decisions are made.

1725
01:04:27,727 --> 01:04:30,993
- Just stop the numbers
talk for a second, okay?

1726
01:04:32,488 --> 01:04:36,600
Thee are my friends and I
don't get the numbers thing.

1727
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:40,710
- The advertising dollars
are based on the numbers.

1728
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:43,250
If you're an advertiser,
right, you have a product.

1729
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:45,350
You want to sell this product, right?

1730
01:04:45,350 --> 01:04:46,183
You want it on the highest level--

1731
01:04:46,183 --> 01:04:49,670
- My director has a son and a wife and

1732
01:04:51,234 --> 01:04:54,544
my editor just got married and--

1733
01:04:54,544 --> 01:04:55,700
- Think about it this way, right?

1734
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:57,830
Now if your work on the
documentary is successful.

1735
01:04:57,830 --> 01:04:58,790
- Mm-hm.

1736
01:04:58,790 --> 01:05:01,460
- That's going to lead
to more options for you.

1737
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:02,573
You're gonna have control--

1738
01:05:02,573 --> 01:05:04,690
- I'm single, though, that's not fair.

1739
01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:06,410
I mean, I'm happy about that.

1740
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:09,110
- See, there's nothing I can
do, you know what I mean?

1741
01:05:10,083 --> 01:05:12,150
- Between the estrogen
and the testosterone,

1742
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:14,560
I have smoothed out so much.

1743
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:15,570
I really recommend it.

1744
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:17,590
- [Lulu] Is that for the
rest of your life, I mean--

1745
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:19,857
- You know, if it'll keep me sane,

1746
01:05:19,857 --> 01:05:20,903
it is for the rest of
my life and that's fine.

1747
01:05:20,903 --> 01:05:22,720
- [Carson] Do you put it on top of the--

1748
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,146
- No, you put it on a different one,

1749
01:05:24,146 --> 01:05:25,137
like do it on this one--

1750
01:05:25,137 --> 01:05:26,060
- Guys, tea?
- I did it on both.

1751
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:27,263
- Yeah, I'd love some tea.

1752
01:05:27,263 --> 01:05:28,096
- Rich?

1753
01:05:28,096 --> 01:05:28,929
- Honeybush, yeah.

1754
01:05:28,929 --> 01:05:31,053
- Rich, you're not going home
tonight. You're staying here.

1755
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:33,960
- You put it on the inside.

1756
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,400
- Does it matter where you--

1757
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,030
- Yeah, it does, there are certain places.

1758
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:39,120
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hey.

1759
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:40,256
- [Carson] Oh, thank you.

1760
01:05:40,256 --> 01:05:41,532
- Wait, who else needs a--

1761
01:05:41,532 --> 01:05:42,615
- We're good.

1762
01:05:45,873 --> 01:05:48,250
- This is the DHA, that's another one.

1763
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:51,320
- Mrs. Goldenrod's got axed today.

1764
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,460
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

1765
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:55,495
- No, Mom, I'm not standing for this.

1766
01:05:55,495 --> 01:05:56,570
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

1767
01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:57,902
I'm cooking up something.

1768
01:05:57,902 --> 01:05:59,370
- Cooking up something?

1769
01:05:59,370 --> 01:06:01,915
- Yeah, I'm gonna do
something, I have something.

1770
01:06:01,915 --> 01:06:03,330
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know yet.

1771
01:06:03,330 --> 01:06:04,800
But I'm going to do it.

1772
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,000
- Oh, sweetheart, I'm so sorry.

1773
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,628
- Families, co-workers of
mine, losing their jobs.

1774
01:06:11,628 --> 01:06:14,910
Their kids going to school, it's.

1775
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:16,727
- It's happening all over the country.

1776
01:06:16,727 --> 01:06:18,080
- Mediocrity.
- Yeah, mediocrity.

1777
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:19,589
- You were so good.

1778
01:06:19,589 --> 01:06:21,383
- Well, you don't have
to worry too much, Moxie.

1779
01:06:21,383 --> 01:06:22,353
You got your show.

1780
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:24,460
- What show?
- What?

1781
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:27,370
- It's...

1782
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:28,900
My show got greenlit.

1783
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:30,141
- When?
- Show about what?

1784
01:06:30,141 --> 01:06:31,362
- And congratulations.

1785
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:32,250
- The menopause show.

1786
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:33,363
Rich, don't be sarcastic.

1787
01:06:33,363 --> 01:06:34,196
- I'm not being sarcastic.

1788
01:06:34,196 --> 01:06:35,050
- The menopause show!

1789
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:36,050
- You know--

1790
01:06:36,050 --> 01:06:37,520
- Mox, it's great, it's great.

1791
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:38,857
- There's a hint of
bitterness in your voice.

1792
01:06:38,857 --> 01:06:41,094
- Look, I'm bitter because I lost my job

1793
01:06:41,094 --> 01:06:42,552
but truly, it's great.

1794
01:06:42,552 --> 01:06:44,210
- This is terrible.

1795
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:45,043
This is...

1796
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:49,310
Rich, I don't, I don't.

1797
01:06:49,310 --> 01:06:50,893
- I'll find another job, Moxie.

1798
01:06:52,623 --> 01:06:54,945
(wheezing)

1799
01:06:54,945 --> 01:06:58,011
- Rich, Rich, Rich, no, no, no.

1800
01:06:58,011 --> 01:07:00,428
- He's having a panic attack.

1801
01:07:01,357 --> 01:07:02,774
- Rich, Rich, no.

1802
01:07:05,142 --> 01:07:07,337
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1803
01:07:07,337 --> 01:07:09,022
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

1804
01:07:09,022 --> 01:07:10,755
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

1805
01:07:10,755 --> 01:07:12,809
Easy, easy, easy.

1806
01:07:12,809 --> 01:07:15,880
(breathing deeply)

1807
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,745
- [Carson] Lie down and have a blanket.

1808
01:07:17,745 --> 01:07:18,578
- Yeah, yeah.
- Right?

1809
01:07:18,578 --> 01:07:19,875
Like going into shock kind of thing.

1810
01:07:19,875 --> 01:07:21,095
- Mom, Mom?

1811
01:07:21,095 --> 01:07:22,795
Do your breathing with him, do your--

1812
01:07:22,795 --> 01:07:24,410
- This is embarrassing,
this is embarrassing.

1813
01:07:24,410 --> 01:07:27,875
- No, stop judging yourself,
stop judging yourself.

1814
01:07:27,875 --> 01:07:29,954
- There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

1815
01:07:29,954 --> 01:07:31,978
- Are you feeling any better?
- Okay, Mom, Mom, do it.

1816
01:07:31,978 --> 01:07:32,851
- Okay, okay.

1817
01:07:32,851 --> 01:07:33,684
- Mom, do what?

1818
01:07:33,684 --> 01:07:35,303
- She's doing her healing,
yeah, just let her--

1819
01:07:35,303 --> 01:07:36,272
- No, not the shoes!

1820
01:07:36,272 --> 01:07:37,271
- Shh.

1821
01:07:37,271 --> 01:07:38,593
- Not the shoes.

1822
01:07:38,593 --> 01:07:39,426
- Shh, just be quiet!

1823
01:07:39,426 --> 01:07:40,259
- [Rita] We're not taking them off.

1824
01:07:40,259 --> 01:07:41,210
- Just, Richie, be quiet.

1825
01:07:41,210 --> 01:07:42,043
- Just breathe.

1826
01:07:42,043 --> 01:07:43,911
- She's doing, she does reiki.

1827
01:07:43,911 --> 01:07:46,100
- Just breathe.

1828
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:47,750
- Good, see?

1829
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:48,793
- [Rita] Close your eyes.

1830
01:07:48,793 --> 01:07:49,626
- She's taking off, she's cutting things.

1831
01:07:49,626 --> 01:07:50,930
- Hold his feet is good.

1832
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:52,570
- Close your eyes.

1833
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:55,034
- She's so good at this.

1834
01:07:55,034 --> 01:07:58,983
- Let the negative energy, just go away.

1835
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,340
- She's getting rid of it.

1836
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:03,240
- Mom's pulling it, whoosh!

1837
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:06,430
Whoosh, whoosh!

1838
01:08:06,430 --> 01:08:07,263
- Easy.

1839
01:08:07,263 --> 01:08:09,569
(whooshing)

1840
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:15,670
- Okay.

1841
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:19,003
(Rich breathing deeply)

1842
01:08:23,831 --> 01:08:25,581
- Just smooth it out.

1843
01:08:29,235 --> 01:08:32,152
(breathing deeply)

1844
01:08:39,179 --> 01:08:41,357
- [Rich] It's better, it's better.

1845
01:08:41,357 --> 01:08:46,305
- [Producer] And in
five, four, three, two.

1846
01:08:46,305 --> 01:08:49,555

1847

- Go through router six and
router eight when you're ready.

1864
01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:50,879
- I had no idea that you had
blossomed into this woman.

1865
01:09:50,879 --> 01:09:52,217
(woman chuckling)

1866
01:09:52,217 --> 01:09:53,233
- Is that a cricket?

1867
01:09:53,233 --> 01:09:54,365
What am I doing?

1868
01:09:54,365 --> 01:09:55,782
- Come over here.

1869
01:09:57,533 --> 01:09:59,860
- If the network's gonna fire me,

1870
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:01,379
they're going to get a few surprises.

1871
01:10:01,379 --> 01:10:04,113
Just help me do this, okay?

1872
01:10:04,113 --> 01:10:05,333
- Showtime.

1873
01:10:05,333 --> 01:10:08,333
(crickets chirping)

1874
01:10:18,282 --> 01:10:19,292
(Carson whistling)

1875
01:10:19,292 --> 01:10:20,250
(ice rattling)

1876
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:21,083
- Hey.

1877
01:10:22,362 --> 01:10:23,245
- How you doing?

1878
01:10:23,245 --> 01:10:24,078
- I'm good.

1879
01:10:24,078 --> 01:10:24,911
- Good.

1880
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:27,689
- Let me get out of here.

1881
01:10:27,689 --> 01:10:29,600
- No, no, no, no, it's
all right, it's all right.

1882
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,433
Stay here.

1883
01:10:30,433 --> 01:10:34,000
Shh, shh, shh, shh, the
girls are all sleeping.

1884
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,380
I can't sleep four in a bed.

1885
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:37,220
I'm gonna stay in here with you tonight.

1886
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:38,053
- Don't be silly, I'm--

1887
01:10:38,053 --> 01:10:39,792
- No, no, that's okay.

1888
01:10:39,792 --> 01:10:40,982
- What are you talking about?

1889
01:10:40,982 --> 01:10:42,470
- This is a big bed.

1890
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:44,089
- Carson, are you crazy?

1891
01:10:44,089 --> 01:10:45,860
I'm gonna get on the couch
if you're going to stay here.

1892
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:47,030
- Don't give me the couch,

1893
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:48,781
I wanna sleep here, it's okay.

1894
01:10:48,781 --> 01:10:50,410
- You can't sleep here with me.

1895
01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:54,058
- Why not, friends forever, c'mon.

1896
01:10:54,058 --> 01:10:55,716
- Could I have a sip?

1897
01:10:55,716 --> 01:10:58,000
- You wanna sip? (laughing)

1898
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,854
I make really good drinks.

1899
01:10:59,854 --> 01:11:02,177
- I think you've had a little too much.

1900
01:11:02,177 --> 01:11:05,252
- I know, and my feet are killing me.

1901
01:11:05,252 --> 01:11:07,370
Can you take my boots off, please?

1902
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:08,600
- Take your boots off?

1903
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:09,557
- Mm-hmm.

1904
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:13,570
- Okay, I'll take your boots
off and get you into bed.

1905
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:16,340
- Yeah, no, first of all,
you unzip this right there.

1906
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:17,553
That's the first step.

1907
01:11:18,552 --> 01:11:19,734
- Okay.

1908
01:11:19,734 --> 01:11:22,079
(groaning)

1909
01:11:22,079 --> 01:11:23,746
- Oh, yeah, release.

1910
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:25,930
- Okay, we're all here.

1911
01:11:26,770 --> 01:11:29,240
We called this meeting today
to go over a few things.

1912
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:31,360
We've been here for a few days now.

1913
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,350
We've come to some conclusions.

1914
01:11:33,350 --> 01:11:36,889
We still have some questions,
but it's safe to say

1915
01:11:36,889 --> 01:11:39,170
some decisions have been made.

1916
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:41,836
First of all, we want to welcome Moxie

1917
01:11:41,836 --> 01:11:44,431
as executive producer,
she's gonna be on all

1918
01:11:44,431 --> 01:11:46,565
the executive board meetings from now on.

1919
01:11:46,565 --> 01:11:47,398
- [Sherry] Yay, Moxie.

1920
01:11:47,398 --> 01:11:48,973
(clapping)

1921
01:11:48,973 --> 01:11:51,055
- All right, way to go.

1922
01:11:51,055 --> 01:11:51,888
- Thank you.

1923
01:11:51,888 --> 01:11:54,081
- We are full steam
ahead with "The M Word."

1924
01:11:54,081 --> 01:11:55,100
- Thank you.

1925
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:56,510
- Going well, right?

1926
01:11:56,510 --> 01:11:57,343
- Mm-hmm.

1927
01:11:57,343 --> 01:11:58,176
- Good.

1928
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:02,407
Second on our list, "Extreme Sports."

1929
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,330
The show is hemorrhaging viewers.

1930
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:09,980
We think for the show to survive,

1931
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:11,620
we have to go with somebody younger

1932
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:13,680
as the face of "Extreme Sports."

1933
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:15,376
If we're going to keep
the show on the air,

1934
01:12:15,376 --> 01:12:17,700
we need a new face of the show.

1935
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:19,850
Mack, that means you
can no longer host it.

1936
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:23,189
At the same time, you will
maintain your position

1937
01:12:23,189 --> 01:12:25,333
as executive producer.

1938
01:12:25,333 --> 01:12:28,660
I think it's time for
you to even focus more on

1939
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:29,847
that aspect of the show.

1940
01:12:29,847 --> 01:12:30,805
- Wait a minute, wait, wait,

1941
01:12:30,805 --> 01:12:32,667
what do you mean we're
hemorrhaging viewers?

1942
01:12:32,667 --> 01:12:36,021
- The, the, the last
quarter, Mack, you lost 20%

1943
01:12:36,021 --> 01:12:38,930
in the 18- to 35-year-old demographic.

1944
01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:41,115
And that's very alarming
to us and to New York.

1945
01:12:41,115 --> 01:12:43,150
- You're getting rid of my show?

1946
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:45,180
- We're got getting
rid of your show, Mack.

1947
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:47,440
We're gonna hire someone else to host it.

1948
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,070
- He came up with show, he is the show.

1949
01:12:49,070 --> 01:12:50,290
- It's still your show,

1950
01:12:50,290 --> 01:12:51,668
you're going to be executive producer,

1951
01:12:51,668 --> 01:12:53,600
you're gonna design the segments,

1952
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,410
you're gonna choose the locations.

1953
01:12:55,410 --> 01:12:57,000
I want you to chime in and help us out

1954
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,130
on picking someone to replace you.

1955
01:12:59,130 --> 01:13:01,230
- The whole reason I've
been successful for 30 years

1956
01:13:01,230 --> 01:13:03,372
doing this show is because
there are no other people

1957
01:13:03,372 --> 01:13:04,819
who can stand in front of the camera and

1958
01:13:04,819 --> 01:13:07,520
can also do the sports
that he's talking about.

1959
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,220
- Exactly.
- We're not convinced of that.

1960
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:11,560
- And, actually, Mack, you
can help us work on that.

1961
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:13,015
- I'd like to hear from you who you think

1962
01:13:13,015 --> 01:13:15,255
will be a good replacement.

1963
01:13:15,255 --> 01:13:16,088
- [Moxie] Nobody.

1964
01:13:16,088 --> 01:13:18,160
- It just comes from corporate.
It's just demographics--

1965
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:18,993
- Wait a minute!

1966
01:13:18,993 --> 01:13:19,826
- I don't understand.

1967
01:13:19,826 --> 01:13:22,430
What the hell, what are you
talking about, replacing me?

1968
01:13:22,430 --> 01:13:23,263
With who?

1969
01:13:23,263 --> 01:13:24,096
- Mack--

1970
01:13:24,096 --> 01:13:25,744
- Yeah, who is going to replace him?

1971
01:13:25,744 --> 01:13:28,040
- You're a ball player, which
is what I consider you to be.

1972
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,500
- I can do it.

1973
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:30,333
- [Moxie] Benny!

1974
01:13:30,333 --> 01:13:31,166
- I can do it.
- Benny!

1975
01:13:31,166 --> 01:13:33,180
- No, no, no, no, listen
to me, listen to me.

1976
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:34,660
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
we're in the middle

1977
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:35,640
of a meeting here.

1978
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,470
What makes you think you can barge in,

1979
01:13:37,470 --> 01:13:40,070
walk through the door, and
chime in with your opinion?

1980
01:13:40,070 --> 01:13:41,620
- Hold on, honey, hold on.

1981
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:43,093
- Go, go, go, go.

1982
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:47,560
What are you doing?

1983
01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:49,323
What are you doing?

1984
01:13:49,323 --> 01:13:50,770
- They need to hear the truth.

1985
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:51,603
- The truth?

1986
01:13:51,603 --> 01:13:52,790
- Yes.
- The truth?

1987
01:13:52,790 --> 01:13:55,161
- The bottom line is I've been
on the phone with these guys.

1988
01:13:55,161 --> 01:13:56,726
- What guys, what guys?

1989
01:13:56,726 --> 01:13:58,660
- The guys who are our sponsors.

1990
01:13:58,660 --> 01:13:59,970
The guys who are our advertisers.

1991
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:01,447
What they wanna see is they wanna see--

1992
01:14:01,447 --> 01:14:02,401
- You?

1993
01:14:02,401 --> 01:14:04,430
- They wanna see a younger host.

1994
01:14:04,430 --> 01:14:05,630
- They wanna see--
- That's what they wanna see.

1995
01:14:05,630 --> 01:14:08,007
Do you wanna see it go to some kid

1996
01:14:08,007 --> 01:14:10,292
who's not even a part of this network?

1997
01:14:10,292 --> 01:14:11,340
- Benny!
- Or do you wanna see it

1998
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:12,460
stay within the family?

1999
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:14,221
Because I'm talking about an opportunity

2000
01:14:14,221 --> 01:14:15,790
where we can revamp this.

2001
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:18,344
They don't give a shit about
watching some old fart,

2002
01:14:18,344 --> 01:14:20,620
with all due respect, doing this show--

2003
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:22,108
- Do not call my stepfather an old fart.

2004
01:14:22,108 --> 01:14:23,420
- Listen to me.
- You know what,

2005
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:24,281
you don't even kill spiders.

2006
01:14:24,281 --> 01:14:25,750
- You're making it personal.
- I have to kill the spiders!

2007
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:26,838
- What the fuck does that
have to do with sports?

2008
01:14:26,838 --> 01:14:27,740
- If I have to kill the fucking spiders,

2009
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:28,643
you can't do a report--
- Is that sports?

2010
01:14:28,643 --> 01:14:30,903
Is there a spider sport I'm unaware of?

2011
01:14:30,903 --> 01:14:32,320
- No, no!
- I'm with you.

2012
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:35,230
We're on the same page, what
I wanna see is him protected,

2013
01:14:35,230 --> 01:14:37,290
you protected, the whole family protected.

2014
01:14:37,290 --> 01:14:38,640
I wanna see the network thrive.

2015
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,640
- How do you possibly think
that you can take over

2016
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:43,850
an extreme sporting show?

2017
01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:47,320
- Look at me, look at
me, I'm in great shape.

2018
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:48,310
That's why!

2019
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:50,893
(lively music)

2020
01:14:54,510 --> 01:14:57,600
- Ladies and gentlemen, may I
have your attention, please?

2021
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,197
Everyone, would you mind
standing up, please,

2022
01:14:59,197 --> 01:15:01,700
and just gathering, coming closer?

2023
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:03,230
Yes, you people in the back, too, please,

2024
01:15:03,230 --> 01:15:04,640
come forward if you will.

2025
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:05,924
Come forward, you in the back,

2026
01:15:05,924 --> 01:15:08,540
yes, come forward, please.

2027
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:12,243
As you remember, I'm Harry
Rubinek and Charlie Moon.

2028
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:15,060
I'm gonna read off a few names.

2029
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:17,280
I'd like you to raise your
hand when I call your name,

2030
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,240
please, and afterwards,

2031
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:22,200
Charlie will explain
to you what's going on.

2032
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,983
Number one, Karen Feegle.

2033
01:15:26,570 --> 01:15:27,620
Very good, thank you.

2034
01:15:28,550 --> 01:15:32,220
Number two, Dee Dee Sullivan.

2035
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:33,053
Thank you.

2036
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:37,693
Number three, Louise Kaloff?

2037
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:40,233
Thank you.

2038
01:15:42,097 --> 01:15:46,383
Number four, Justine Frolly.

2039
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:51,190
Thank you very much, thank you.

2040
01:15:51,190 --> 01:15:53,383
A few more names here, one moment, please.

2041
01:15:54,310 --> 01:15:58,733
We have number five, Priscilla Sacks.

2042
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:03,053
Very good.

2043
01:16:04,050 --> 01:16:07,753
Number six, Katie Summers.

2044
01:16:09,230 --> 01:16:10,550
Thank you.

2045
01:16:10,550 --> 01:16:13,533
Number seven, Michael Goodman.

2046
01:16:15,310 --> 01:16:17,070
Thank you very much.

2047
01:16:17,070 --> 01:16:20,353
And number eight, Pauline Reid.

2048
01:16:22,970 --> 01:16:23,803
Thank you.

2049
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:29,480
And Jimmy Greegs.

2050
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:32,580
Okay, thank you, you can
all put your hands down now.

2051
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:34,880
- Thank you, those of you whose names

2052
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,010
have just been mentioned,

2053
01:16:36,010 --> 01:16:39,009
you will be receiving
our Golden Plan package.

2054
01:16:39,009 --> 01:16:42,520
Now, although that does
mean early retirement

2055
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:45,460
at the end of this year, more importantly,

2056
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:48,087
it means a very, very
generous benefit package,

2057
01:16:48,087 --> 01:16:50,226
and that's going to kick in January 1st.

2058
01:16:50,226 --> 01:16:53,143
The details of the package
are going to be explained

2059
01:16:53,143 --> 01:16:54,718
in a letter you're gonna be receiving

2060
01:16:54,718 --> 01:16:56,950
sometime after Thanksgiving.

2061
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:58,594
This is not an easy decision.

2062
01:16:58,594 --> 01:17:01,585
I wanna thank you all for
your years of dedication

2063
01:17:01,585 --> 01:17:05,124
and hard work here,
and I think the package

2064
01:17:05,124 --> 01:17:07,891
is really gonna help you to transition

2065
01:17:07,891 --> 01:17:09,690
into a new phase of life.

2066
01:17:09,690 --> 01:17:13,770
Like Shakespeare said, "All
good things come to an end,"

2067
01:17:13,770 --> 01:17:17,630
but this ending has a new
beginning on the other side of it,

2068
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:21,360
I think, so let's think
about this as a new chapter.

2069
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,160
We're going to do whatever
we can to help you

2070
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:25,920
with this transition, we--

2071
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:28,632
- You are a shit!

2072
01:17:28,632 --> 01:17:30,070
- Whoa, Moxie, careful.
- You shit!

2073
01:17:30,070 --> 01:17:31,790
- Moxie, careful.

2074
01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:33,190
- What the hell is going on?

2075
01:17:35,513 --> 01:17:36,460
(phone ringing)

2076
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:37,770
Sorry.

2077
01:17:37,770 --> 01:17:41,770
- Um, well, again, this was
a very difficult decision,

2078
01:17:41,770 --> 01:17:46,646
ladies and gentlemen, very
sorry, but there was no other way

2079
01:17:46,646 --> 01:17:51,140
except to make these cuts and again,

2080
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:54,040
we will be around to
discuss any difficulties

2081
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:55,910
or needs that you have,
thank you very much.

2082
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:57,420
- It's all under control, trust me.

2083
01:17:57,420 --> 01:17:59,270
- [Harry] Go back to work, thank you.

2084
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:03,780
- It's exactly what I told you.

2085
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:05,370
We made the necessary adjustments,

2086
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:07,277
we told the employees.

2087
01:18:07,277 --> 01:18:08,527
- I'm so sorry.

2088
01:18:10,810 --> 01:18:13,280
- Harry's talking to them,
I've been talking to them.

2089
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:15,144
It's already going away
because most of them know

2090
01:18:15,144 --> 01:18:18,436
they're going to lose their
jobs and they're scared.

2091
01:18:18,436 --> 01:18:22,103
(all speaking indistinctly)

2092
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:32,676
- Wait a minute, I have the answer!

2093
01:18:32,676 --> 01:18:35,111
I have the answer, it
has to do with these!

2094
01:18:35,111 --> 01:18:37,570
(all cheering)

2095
01:18:37,570 --> 01:18:40,547
We will not be bullied or forced out!

2096
01:18:42,548 --> 01:18:45,677
We will not, we're staying here.

2097
01:18:45,677 --> 01:18:48,270
We are going to keep our
jobs in this station.

2098
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:50,823
I want you to fight the corporation!

2099
01:18:50,823 --> 01:18:54,600
I want you to fight
for our little station!

2100
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,190
We're staying here!

2101
01:18:57,390 --> 01:19:00,042
- Moxie!
- We are not going anywhere!

2102
01:19:00,042 --> 01:19:01,339
Woo!

2103
01:19:01,339 --> 01:19:03,465
- What are you doing?
- Fight for our rights!

2104
01:19:03,465 --> 01:19:07,382
Fight for KZAM, fight
for KZAM, fight for KZAM!

2105
01:19:08,812 --> 01:19:11,609
Fight for KZAM, fight for KZAM!

2106
01:19:11,609 --> 01:19:14,192
Fight for KZAM, fight for KZAM!

2107
01:19:15,825 --> 01:19:17,208
Pass these down!

2108
01:19:17,208 --> 01:19:18,873
Fight for KZAM!

2109
01:19:18,873 --> 01:19:22,340
- What is this, Moxie, what's going on?

2110
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:23,963
- It's a lock-in.

2111
01:19:23,963 --> 01:19:24,921
- [Charlie] Okay.

2112
01:19:24,921 --> 01:19:26,359
(cheering)

2113
01:19:26,359 --> 01:19:27,192
- It's a lock-in.

2114
01:19:27,192 --> 01:19:29,288
- Anyone who does this, what she's saying,

2115
01:19:29,288 --> 01:19:32,520
will join the others in
early retirement, okay?

2116
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,599
You'll be out the door
with everybody else.

2117
01:19:34,599 --> 01:19:35,851
- Or, Charlie--

2118
01:19:35,851 --> 01:19:37,653
- One for all out the door.

2119
01:19:37,653 --> 01:19:39,867
- Charlie, maybe you will
land in early retirement.

2120
01:19:39,867 --> 01:19:41,780
- You're gonna get your co-workers
fired, Moxie, all right?

2121
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:43,630
- Maybe this time, you'l
land in early retirement.

2122
01:19:43,630 --> 01:19:44,786
Maybe it won't be us.

2123
01:19:44,786 --> 01:19:46,527
(cheering)

2124
01:19:46,527 --> 01:19:49,333
Fight this system and what
this country has turned into.

2125
01:19:50,971 --> 01:19:54,178
Stay here, lock yourselves down now!

2126
01:19:54,178 --> 01:19:56,138
Lock yourselves down.

2127
01:19:56,138 --> 01:19:59,224
- Those of you who stay
are breaking the law.

2128
01:19:59,224 --> 01:20:01,474
(cheering)

2129
01:20:03,392 --> 01:20:06,357
Those of you who stay
are breaking the law!

2130
01:20:06,357 --> 01:20:07,575
- You are awesome!

2131
01:20:07,575 --> 01:20:08,497
- Thank you.

2132
01:20:08,497 --> 01:20:10,510
Lock yourselves together,

2133
01:20:10,510 --> 01:20:11,870
lock yourselves together!

2134
01:20:11,870 --> 01:20:14,070
- The police are going to
be called and you'll all

2135
01:20:14,070 --> 01:20:16,003
be arrested for trespassing!

2136
01:20:17,621 --> 01:20:21,907
- [All] Moxie, Moxie,
Moxie, Moxie, Moxie, Moxie!

2137
01:20:21,907 --> 01:20:23,030
- Call the police.

2138
01:20:23,030 --> 01:20:25,190
You're all gonna be
arrested for trespassing!

2139
01:20:25,190 --> 01:20:26,856
I want them out of this building.

2140
01:20:26,856 --> 01:20:31,856
- [All] Moxie, Moxie,
Moxie, Moxie, Moxie, Moxie!

2141
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:34,320
- You're gonna get 'em all fired.

2142
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:36,537
They'll all be out of a job.

2143
01:20:36,537 --> 01:20:37,465
- You're a liar.

2144
01:20:37,465 --> 01:20:38,681
- I'm not a liar.

2145
01:20:38,681 --> 01:20:40,363
- You liar.
- I'm doing my job, Moxie.

2146
01:20:40,363 --> 01:20:42,950
- All of you, if you get
on your Twitter accounts,

2147
01:20:42,950 --> 01:20:45,947
you get on Facebook, you call
up everybody at every station

2148
01:20:45,947 --> 01:20:47,791
that we know, you get us on the news.

2149
01:20:47,791 --> 01:20:51,350
You get everybody that you
know to tweet their friends,

2150
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:52,704
to tell them that we are no longer--

2151
01:20:52,704 --> 01:20:54,295
- You better get them to post bail because

2152
01:20:54,295 --> 01:20:56,919
you're all going to be in jail tonight.

2153
01:20:56,919 --> 01:20:59,250
Oh, great, yeah, yeah.

2154
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:01,840
Okay, all these people have been fired

2155
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,800
and now I want them out of the building.

2156
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:05,169
They're trespassing, okay?

2157
01:21:05,169 --> 01:21:06,002
(laughing)

2158
01:21:06,002 --> 01:21:08,609
Now if you can't handle it,
call the police and let's--

2159
01:21:08,609 --> 01:21:11,459
- Stay with us!
- Come on.

2160
01:21:11,459 --> 01:21:14,449
(all cheering)

2161
01:21:14,449 --> 01:21:16,163
- Hey, he's one of us, come on.

2162
01:21:16,163 --> 01:21:19,411
He's gonna come lock himself
up with us, I'm sorry.

2163
01:21:19,411 --> 01:21:21,416
(cheering)

2164
01:21:21,416 --> 01:21:22,816
- [Charlie] Okay, let's get
the fucking police here.

2165
01:21:22,816 --> 01:21:24,310
- [Harry] This is not
a joke, listen to me--

2166
01:21:24,310 --> 01:21:27,890
- Up yours, Charlie Moon, up yours.

2167
01:21:27,890 --> 01:21:31,973
- [All] Moxie, Moxie,
Moxie, Moxie, Moxie, Moxie!

2168
01:21:34,963 --> 01:21:37,546
(all cheering)

2169
01:21:42,893 --> 01:21:46,230
- You're all facing criminal charges!

2170
01:21:46,230 --> 01:21:49,139
You are all facing criminal charges!

2171
01:21:49,139 --> 01:21:51,244
(cheering)

2172
01:21:51,244 --> 01:21:56,244
- [All] Moxie, Moxie,
Moxie, Moxie, Moxie, Moxie!

2173
01:22:00,776 --> 01:22:02,037
- [Woman] What's next?

2174
01:22:02,037 --> 01:22:04,377
- All right, Sluski!

2175
01:22:04,377 --> 01:22:06,112
Sluski, what can we do on the computer

2176
01:22:06,112 --> 01:22:07,500
to get this out there?

2177
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:10,050
- We could, well, Tweet
would be the better thing.

2178
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:10,959
Let's get our photos into--

2179
01:22:10,959 --> 01:22:13,188
- [All] Tweet, tweet, tweet!

2180
01:22:13,188 --> 01:22:15,288
- Tweet, yes, let's get on it, let's all--

2181
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:17,549
- They're gonna start tweeting.

2182
01:22:17,549 --> 01:22:19,095
They can tweet, they can tweet.

2183
01:22:19,095 --> 01:22:21,390
- Who has over 1,000 Facebook friends?

2184
01:22:21,390 --> 01:22:22,557
- I do!
- I do!

2185
01:22:25,579 --> 01:22:26,947
(Doug laughing)

2186
01:22:26,947 --> 01:22:28,370
- Pull out your cellphones.

2187
01:22:28,370 --> 01:22:30,430
Everybody dial one contact right now.

2188
01:22:30,430 --> 01:22:32,180
- Right now, dial two.

2189
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:33,550
- The highest contact you have.

2190
01:22:33,550 --> 01:22:37,901
Ed Begley, you have a
contact to Ed Begley.

2191
01:22:37,901 --> 01:22:39,950
We need cellphones.

2192
01:22:39,950 --> 01:22:41,027
- [Michael] Get them all.

2193
01:22:42,365 --> 01:22:44,372
(lively music)

2194
01:22:44,372 --> 01:22:46,570
- Ed, I really need your help because

2195
01:22:46,570 --> 01:22:48,913
I know that you show up. You
are a person who shows up.

2196
01:22:48,913 --> 01:22:51,733
You are a man of honor
and integrity and labor!

2197
01:22:53,711 --> 01:22:57,378
(speaking foreign language)

2198
01:23:08,151 --> 01:23:10,901
(dramatic music)

2199
01:23:16,809 --> 01:23:18,059
- Unity, unity!

2200
01:23:19,348 --> 01:23:21,345
It's time for a change!

2201
01:23:21,345 --> 01:23:22,178
- Yes!

2202
01:23:27,430 --> 01:23:31,560
- Okay, I've been
authorized by my superiors

2203
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:34,199
to make some concessions, so...

2204
01:23:34,199 --> 01:23:35,710
(handcuffs rattling)

2205
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:39,153
What can we do to end this madness?

2206
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:42,873
- Revoke all the firings that you did.

2207
01:23:43,790 --> 01:23:45,730
- We're sitting here
trying to negotiate terms.

2208
01:23:45,730 --> 01:23:48,737
You can't just ask for
a 100% of what you want.

2209
01:23:48,737 --> 01:23:49,570
- Why?

2210
01:23:49,570 --> 01:23:50,630
- I mean, negotiations
don't work that way.

2211
01:23:50,630 --> 01:23:51,540
- Why not?

2212
01:23:51,540 --> 01:23:53,600
- I know you've never been
in the situation before.

2213
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,027
You're usually doing a
show in front of the camera

2214
01:23:56,027 --> 01:23:58,837
dressed as a puppy dog,
but this is the real world.

2215
01:23:58,837 --> 01:24:00,600
You can't get everything you want.

2216
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:02,270
- No, it's funny, I've
been in the workforce

2217
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:03,820
for quite some time now and I've never had

2218
01:24:03,820 --> 01:24:07,456
these little two people
come into some corporation

2219
01:24:07,456 --> 01:24:08,619
that I worked for and--
- Moxie!

2220
01:24:08,619 --> 01:24:09,782
- Fired everybody.

2221
01:24:09,782 --> 01:24:11,260
- My job is hanging by a fucking thread!

2222
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:13,440
- Well, I'm sorry!
- I was humiliated

2223
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,934
in front of my fucking boss.

2224
01:24:14,934 --> 01:24:18,929
- How do you think those
people who you fired felt

2225
01:24:18,929 --> 01:24:21,070
when they had to raise
their hands like they were--

2226
01:24:21,070 --> 01:24:23,630
- Three of those people
are over 58 years old.

2227
01:24:23,630 --> 01:24:25,385
They've been with this
company over 25 years.

2228
01:24:25,385 --> 01:24:27,998
It's time to move on.

2229
01:24:27,998 --> 01:24:31,100
Everything has a shelf
life, you understand?

2230
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:32,130
- That's sick, it's sick.

2231
01:24:32,130 --> 01:24:34,730
- It's like bottles of milk, right?

2232
01:24:34,730 --> 01:24:36,600
You gotta know when the expiration date.

2233
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:38,669
Some, they go bad a few days before,

2234
01:24:38,669 --> 01:24:40,511
some you could drink a week after,

2235
01:24:40,511 --> 01:24:43,982
but you gotta know when your time is up!

2236
01:24:43,982 --> 01:24:45,350
(dramatic music)

2237
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:47,019
- [Announcer] Fox News once
again shows the failure

2238
01:24:47,019 --> 01:24:49,558
of the illegal strikers
against the integrity

2239
01:24:49,558 --> 01:24:52,063
of the American corporate system.

2240
01:24:55,516 --> 01:24:58,099
(lively music)

2241
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:13,690
- I think we were at 30.

2242
01:25:13,690 --> 01:25:15,140
- 30 is fair.

2243
01:25:15,140 --> 01:25:19,840
- Because that could mean
saving families, you know--

2244
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:22,520
- I think you're being unrealistic.

2245
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,830
- How 'bout if I don't
do my menopause show,

2246
01:25:24,830 --> 01:25:27,300
then we can keep Deborah--
- We need your menopause show.

2247
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:29,732
- We can keep Deborah
and she's a single mom.

2248
01:25:29,732 --> 01:25:31,110
- See, but then you're keeping
people for the sake of what--

2249
01:25:31,110 --> 01:25:32,440
- For feeding her kids!

2250
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:33,670
- Where are we gonna get ratings

2251
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:34,860
and how are we gonna get sponsors?

2252
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:36,440
We don't have things on the air--

2253
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:38,443
- I want those people to be working.

2254
01:25:40,630 --> 01:25:43,710
I quit, okay, I quit my job here, I do.

2255
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:44,890
- You can't quit.
- I quit.

2256
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:47,328
- You can't quit because I need you.

2257
01:25:47,328 --> 01:25:48,478
- I'm not staying here.

2258
01:25:51,954 --> 01:25:53,093
What?

2259
01:25:54,350 --> 01:25:55,699
- Come on.

2260
01:25:55,699 --> 01:25:57,120
- No.

2261
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,293
- We'll keep 30 people.

2262
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:01,290
We'll keep 40 people.

2263
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:07,323
Come on, please.

2264
01:26:09,820 --> 01:26:11,143
Be my Moxie, come on.

2265
01:26:14,557 --> 01:26:17,140
(lively music)

2266
01:26:35,420 --> 01:26:36,253
- [Man] Moxie?

2267
01:26:38,670 --> 01:26:39,503
Moxie?

2268
01:26:41,590 --> 01:26:42,423
Moxie?

2269
01:26:44,571 --> 01:26:45,404
- Dad?

2270
01:26:49,990 --> 01:26:52,530
- There was that kid in second grade

2271
01:26:52,530 --> 01:26:53,570
and you came home one day

2272
01:26:53,570 --> 01:26:55,620
and said he was bugging you.

2273
01:26:55,620 --> 01:26:59,966
I told you that if it ever
happens again to sock him.

2274
01:26:59,966 --> 01:27:02,360
(laughing)

2275
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:04,230
You came home several days later

2276
01:27:05,180 --> 01:27:07,580
and told me that you
punched him in the stomach.

2277
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:10,720
- His name was Tommy.

2278
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:12,160
- Tommy.

2279
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:13,330
- He was a jerk.

2280
01:27:13,330 --> 01:27:14,700
- [Dad] He was a jerk.

2281
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:15,960
- Yeah.

2282
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:18,160
- That's what a dad
wants to hear, you know?

2283
01:27:19,230 --> 01:27:23,503
That you're strong, that
you can fight for yourself.

2284
01:27:24,770 --> 01:27:27,200
When I came home from the war,

2285
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:29,323
met your mother and we had you,

2286
01:27:30,790 --> 01:27:31,813
I was broken.

2287
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:36,660
Though I loved you more than
anything I've ever known,

2288
01:27:36,660 --> 01:27:39,013
I couldn't contaminate you with my pain.

2289
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:43,190
You suffered from my time in Vietnam

2290
01:27:43,190 --> 01:27:46,763
just as though you'd
been there by my side.

2291
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:51,030
I let you down in so many ways.

2292
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:53,053
I had no idea what had stricken me.

2293
01:27:54,834 --> 01:27:59,027
All I know you is that you
were the brightest spot,

2294
01:28:01,630 --> 01:28:02,733
the brightest spot.

01:28:38,740 --> 01:28:40,030
- What, see what?

2308
01:28:40,030 --> 01:28:42,213
- You still have it in you, girl.

2309
01:28:43,274 --> 01:28:46,403
You must keep on keeping on.

2310
01:28:46,403 --> 01:28:49,324
You must keep on keeping on.

2311
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:51,839
You must keep on keeping on.

2312
01:28:51,839 --> 01:28:54,376
You must keep on keeping on.

2313
01:28:54,376 --> 01:28:57,126
(dramatic music)

2314
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:05,480
- [Announcer] Breaking news this morning,

2315
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:07,835
KZAM TV backs down on dismissals.

2316
01:29:07,835 --> 01:29:10,069
Sources say 40 jobs were saved

2317
01:29:10,069 --> 01:29:12,540
when employee Moxie Landon led a revolt

2318
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:14,759
in which workers chained
themselves to each other

2319
01:29:14,759 --> 01:29:17,150
in response to a corporate downsizing

2320
01:29:17,150 --> 01:29:18,840
by their New York parent affiliate.

2321
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:20,133
More news coming up.

2322
01:29:21,650 --> 01:29:24,000
- I didn't know anything about menopause.

2323
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,930
- I didn't even know what
the word menopause meant.

2324
01:29:26,930 --> 01:29:28,241
- It's a metaphor for feeling like

2325
01:29:28,241 --> 01:29:30,600
you're getting older as a woman.

2326
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:33,270
- You lose the elasticity of your skin.

2327
01:29:33,270 --> 01:29:35,570
- It's so exciting on one
hand and it's so depressing

2328
01:29:35,570 --> 01:29:37,980
and it's so filled with anger.

2329
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:38,870
- You've dried up.

2330
01:29:38,870 --> 01:29:42,880
- Being in places and
wishing I had a fan on me,

2331
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:43,713
all the time.

2332
01:29:43,713 --> 01:29:45,860
- So you're not worth
anything, you're invisible.

2333
01:29:45,860 --> 01:29:47,190
- There's no more pubic hair.

2334
01:29:47,190 --> 01:29:49,000
- I'm not nice.
- You want to have a baby,

2335
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,180
you don't want to have a baby.

2336
01:29:50,180 --> 01:29:51,013
- Night sweats.

2337
01:29:51,013 --> 01:29:51,846
- Mood swings.

2338
01:29:51,846 --> 01:29:52,679
- Cramps.

2339
01:29:52,679 --> 01:29:53,512
- Emotional issues.

2340
01:29:53,512 --> 01:29:54,345
Memory loss.

2341
01:29:54,345 --> 01:29:55,620
- Who am I all over again?

2342
01:29:55,620 --> 01:29:56,939
- Hey, you're a woman, you know,

2343
01:29:56,939 --> 01:30:00,331
you're revered for your sensitivity

2344
01:30:00,331 --> 01:30:04,470
and your compassion and
yet you're bombarded

2345
01:30:04,470 --> 01:30:08,618
with sort of atrocities
and horrible things

2346
01:30:08,618 --> 01:30:12,892
and people discarding
you and you're irrelevant

2347
01:30:12,892 --> 01:30:15,840
and people putting you,
and the rest of the world,

2348
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:16,923
they're in veils.

2349
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:19,193
- Freddie, Charlie Moon.

2350
01:30:20,380 --> 01:30:21,683
I'm good, how are you?

2351
01:30:23,150 --> 01:30:25,707
Excellent, excellent.

2352
01:30:25,707 --> 01:30:29,140
I wanna revisit the conversation we had

2353
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:32,830
about your original content channel idea.

2354
01:30:32,830 --> 01:30:35,604
I've met some people out here in L.A.,

2355
01:30:35,604 --> 01:30:38,913
they're talking apps, we're
talking niche programming

2356
01:30:38,913 --> 01:30:41,610
for older women, older adults,

2357
01:30:41,610 --> 01:30:45,043
40 to 65 and even beyond that.

2358
01:30:46,570 --> 01:30:50,388
Like, exactly, Oprah Winfrey
for the 21st century.

2359
01:30:50,388 --> 01:30:53,055
(festive music)

2360
01:30:59,571 --> 01:31:02,842
- Okay, so wait, am I
inviting people in now?

2361
01:31:02,842 --> 01:31:05,759
- No, give us a minute.
- No, what?

2362
01:31:08,233 --> 01:31:11,345
- Hi, how are you, wow, look at this.

2363
01:31:11,345 --> 01:31:12,646
- See, great minds think alike.

2364
01:31:12,646 --> 01:31:16,218
(all speaking indistinctly)

2365
01:31:16,218 --> 01:31:17,778
- I didn't think I could
wear yellow, who knew?

2366
01:31:17,778 --> 01:31:20,028
(laughing)

2367
01:31:21,452 --> 01:31:22,285
- What is this?

2368
01:31:22,285 --> 01:31:23,580
- These are rolls.

2369
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:25,373
Mom, you know...

2370
01:31:28,937 --> 01:31:31,764
Do you guys want some wine?
Can I get you some wine?

2371
01:31:31,764 --> 01:31:32,597
- Sure.

2372
01:31:33,730 --> 01:31:35,337
- Well, that's a good point, you can look

2373
01:31:35,337 --> 01:31:37,026
but you can't touch, is that the deal?

2374
01:31:37,026 --> 01:31:39,909
(all speaking indistinctly)

2375
01:31:39,909 --> 01:31:42,977
- That's a beautiful blue,
by the way, I like the.

2376
01:31:42,977 --> 01:31:45,600
- You actually can make that
from theory into technology

2377
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,000
but you don't even know anything yet

2378
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,590
about what technology to
apply to that because it can--

2379
01:31:50,590 --> 01:31:53,427
- We are not trying to
launch a rocket ship.

2380
01:31:53,427 --> 01:31:56,050
We can record this room
and be in the shed and

2381
01:31:56,050 --> 01:31:57,943
be viewing all this like that.

2382
01:32:00,973 --> 01:32:03,910
- There's two things
that holidays make me.

2383
01:32:03,910 --> 01:32:05,707
They make me either really depressed

2384
01:32:05,707 --> 01:32:08,137
or they make me really horny.

2385
01:32:08,137 --> 01:32:09,170
- Ah.

2386
01:32:09,170 --> 01:32:11,310
- And right now--
- Are you depressed?

2387
01:32:11,310 --> 01:32:12,580
- No.

2388
01:32:12,580 --> 01:32:15,500
I read this "Time Magazine"
article that anxiety

2389
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:17,550
can be really good if used the right way.

2390
01:32:19,030 --> 01:32:20,967
- Point me in the right direction.

2391
01:32:23,060 --> 01:32:24,850
- Maybe you should go first and

2392
01:32:24,850 --> 01:32:26,928
then I'm gonna go after you.

2393
01:32:26,928 --> 01:32:27,761
Okay?

2394
01:32:29,767 --> 01:32:30,690
Yeah, okay?

2395
01:32:30,690 --> 01:32:31,523
- Yeah.

2396
01:32:40,605 --> 01:32:42,108
- Hey.
- Hey!

2397
01:32:42,108 --> 01:32:43,465
- What's going on?

2398
01:32:43,465 --> 01:32:44,480
(sighing)

2399
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,963
- I guess it was a good
Thanksgiving party, huh?

2400
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:51,220
- Is it over, we just got food.

2401
01:32:51,220 --> 01:32:52,947
What, are you done already,
kicking everybody out?

2402
01:32:52,947 --> 01:32:54,480
- A bowl of mashed potatoes.

2403
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:57,762
He's out there talking to a
freaking blonde, who is she?

2404
01:32:57,762 --> 01:32:59,251
- Oh, Mom, that's his assistant.

2405
01:32:59,251 --> 01:33:00,084
- It's his assistant.

2406
01:33:00,084 --> 01:33:01,320
- His assistant?

2407
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:02,830
Oh, it always happens
that way, doesn't it?

2408
01:33:02,830 --> 01:33:04,803
Mom, Mom, no.

2409
01:33:05,670 --> 01:33:08,554
She keeps his schedule--
- Why is his assistant here?

2410
01:33:08,554 --> 01:33:10,785
This is a family Thanksgiving!

2411
01:33:10,785 --> 01:33:12,560
- Thank you for saying so, Carson,

2412
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:13,670
'cause I was just kinda wondering

2413
01:33:13,670 --> 01:33:15,630
the same thing about our boss.

2414
01:33:15,630 --> 01:33:17,020
- What?

2415
01:33:17,020 --> 01:33:17,853
- Yeah.

2416
01:33:17,853 --> 01:33:18,686
- Are you drunk?
- You seem very,

2417
01:33:18,686 --> 01:33:20,039
yeah, I'm drunk, I think you and I maybe

2418
01:33:20,039 --> 01:33:22,060
are in the same club.

2419
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:23,525
Maybe we should join a club together.

2420
01:33:23,525 --> 01:33:25,198
- It's actually really good.

2421
01:33:25,198 --> 01:33:26,862
- The mashed potatoes,
yeah, they're really good.

2422
01:33:26,862 --> 01:33:28,215
- I wasn't gonna eat 'em anyway.

2423
01:33:28,215 --> 01:33:29,744
- No, Rita did a good job with those.

2424
01:33:29,744 --> 01:33:31,711
- I lost my appetite.
- I'll smash them in her face.

2425
01:33:31,711 --> 01:33:34,000
- No, no, no, Mom, Mom!

2426
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,365
Look, you know what, cut the crap.

2427
01:33:36,365 --> 01:33:37,610
- Me cut the crap?

2428
01:33:37,610 --> 01:33:38,540
- Yeah, cut the crap, yeah.

2429
01:33:38,540 --> 01:33:39,820
- Now I'm cutting crap.

2430
01:33:39,820 --> 01:33:41,680
That's kinda funny, that's
kinda funny, because--

2431
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:42,697
- Did you find the aspirin?

2432
01:33:42,697 --> 01:33:43,620
- I did, thank you.

2433
01:33:43,620 --> 01:33:45,205
- Oh, you're so welcome.

2434
01:33:45,205 --> 01:33:46,210
- I'm good, thanks.

2435
01:33:46,210 --> 01:33:47,190
- See?

2436
01:33:47,190 --> 01:33:48,139
- Yeah, see what?

2437
01:33:48,139 --> 01:33:49,790
- See, see, paranoid.
- Plenty, I saw plenty.

2438
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:52,140
Oh, paranoid, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2439
01:33:52,140 --> 01:33:53,267
Hey, how's it going?

2440
01:33:53,267 --> 01:33:54,327
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

2441
01:33:54,327 --> 01:33:55,160
Everything's great.

2442
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:56,221
Everything's great.
- It's going well,

2443
01:33:56,221 --> 01:33:58,050
do you want some more--
- I feel very comfortable,

2444
01:33:58,050 --> 01:33:58,910
it's a great Thanksgiving.

2445
01:33:58,910 --> 01:34:00,810
I'm very happy right now,

2446
01:34:00,810 --> 01:34:01,643
it's a holiday.

2447
01:34:01,643 --> 01:34:02,670
- You seem a little, uh.

2448
01:34:02,670 --> 01:34:03,850
- Hostile, yeah.

2449
01:34:03,850 --> 01:34:04,863
- Yeah, you seem a little.

2450
01:34:04,863 --> 01:34:07,520
- I don't know why, maybe it's just me,

2451
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:09,280
but something is telling me that

2452
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:10,150
there's something going on here

2453
01:34:10,150 --> 01:34:11,430
that I'm not being made aware of.

2454
01:34:11,430 --> 01:34:12,362
Is there anything that
you'd like to maybe--

2455
01:34:12,362 --> 01:34:13,200
- Sorry, who was I with?

2456
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:14,183
- I don't know, it was right here.

2457
01:34:14,183 --> 01:34:17,350
Right here in the middle of a
family dinner, I don't know.

2458
01:34:17,350 --> 01:34:18,183
- Tonight's Thanksgiving,

2459
01:34:18,183 --> 01:34:19,060
I'm not really aware of what's going on.

2460
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:20,290
- I thought that we were, like,

2461
01:34:20,290 --> 01:34:22,340
actually had feelings, I
thought that there was actually

2462
01:34:22,340 --> 01:34:24,320
an emotion being conveyed
between the two of us

2463
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:27,353
but apparently I'm wrong
because now Mr. Hotshot

2464
01:34:27,353 --> 01:34:30,700
with the suit comes in and
just sweeps you off your feet.

2465
01:34:30,700 --> 01:34:31,533
- I didn't sweep anybody.

2466
01:34:31,533 --> 01:34:32,366
- In front of everyone.

2467
01:34:32,366 --> 01:34:33,770
That's fine, I'll leave, I'll leave.

2468
01:34:33,770 --> 01:34:35,047
- What are you talking about?

2469
01:34:35,047 --> 01:34:36,493
- Want me outta here, I'm gone.

2470
01:34:36,493 --> 01:34:38,405
- [Carson] Nobody has to leave.

2471
01:34:38,405 --> 01:34:40,339
- He's telling me that
this involves me too.

2472
01:34:40,339 --> 01:34:42,207
I don't understand what's going on here.

2473
01:34:42,207 --> 01:34:44,087
- How does this involve you?

2474
01:34:44,087 --> 01:34:46,870
I'm trying my best to
be polite and political.

2475
01:34:46,870 --> 01:34:49,610
Please, do me a favor and stop!

2476
01:34:49,610 --> 01:34:51,426
- Stop what, I'm not doing anything?

2477
01:34:51,426 --> 01:34:54,057
- All right, all right, that's it!

2478
01:34:54,057 --> 01:34:56,110
- I'm being made to look
like a fool, you understand?

2479
01:34:56,110 --> 01:34:57,596
- Shut your mouth, shut your mouth!

2480
01:34:57,596 --> 01:35:00,866
- She's fucking disrespecting
me right in front of everyone.

2481
01:35:00,866 --> 01:35:04,057
- Do you forget what you're doing?

2482
01:35:04,057 --> 01:35:05,672
- I'm still a human being,
I still have feelings--

2483
01:35:05,672 --> 01:35:07,253
- Do you wanna go back,
do you think I give a shit

2484
01:35:07,253 --> 01:35:09,480
about your personal feelings?

2485
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:11,810
This is business, and you better remember

2486
01:35:11,810 --> 01:35:14,340
what we're doing here
and how close we are.

2487
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:17,493
- In many businesses,
the sum of the businesses

2488
01:35:17,493 --> 01:35:20,410
are worth more than the individual parts,

2489
01:35:20,410 --> 01:35:22,310
but it works the other way also

2490
01:35:22,310 --> 01:35:25,100
and there are businesses where
the individual components

2491
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:27,080
actually carry the rest of it.

2492
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:28,893
Now, when some part isn't going so well,

2493
01:35:28,893 --> 01:35:31,200
they're looking to sell off some part

2494
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:32,600
and make a good profit on it.

2495
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:35,070
- And I swear to God, if you fuck this up,

2496
01:35:35,070 --> 01:35:37,620
I will hunt you down, I
will fucking cut you up.

2497
01:35:37,620 --> 01:35:39,427
It's like that, my little friend.

2498
01:35:39,427 --> 01:35:42,920
We are so very close to ending this.

2499
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:44,530
- That's what I have an uneasy feeling

2500
01:35:44,530 --> 01:35:47,090
is happening over here
and that's why I think

2501
01:35:47,090 --> 01:35:50,870
some of this business is
depressed almost purposefully.

2502
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:52,318
- Yeah.

2503
01:35:52,318 --> 01:35:54,985
(door creaking)

2504
01:35:58,910 --> 01:36:01,010
- Do you care if I told you I was horny?

2505
01:36:01,010 --> 01:36:02,800
- Yeah, I take that very personally.

2506
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:03,740
- No, I'm serious.

2507
01:36:03,740 --> 01:36:05,710
- I take it extremely personal.

2508
01:36:05,710 --> 01:36:09,182
- I really do get one of two things.

2509
01:36:09,182 --> 01:36:12,380
I either get, on Thanksgiving,

2510
01:36:12,380 --> 01:36:15,813
seasonal affective
disorder or I get horny.

2511
01:36:16,810 --> 01:36:18,269
- Put your dick back in your pants.

2512
01:36:18,269 --> 01:36:20,028
- It's not about my dick--
- And keep your mouth--

2513
01:36:20,028 --> 01:36:22,140
- It's not about my dick,
it's about being disrespected

2514
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:23,457
blatantly in front of everybody--

2515
01:36:23,457 --> 01:36:24,290
- I don't give a fuck about you

2516
01:36:24,290 --> 01:36:25,340
being disrespected, you understand?

2517
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:27,478
Do you wanna go back to
that $2 an hour salary?

2518
01:36:27,478 --> 01:36:29,878
- We sneak out, we create a diversion,

2519
01:36:29,878 --> 01:36:31,534
then we get outta here, you understand?

2520
01:36:31,534 --> 01:36:32,580
- I want something now.

2521
01:36:32,580 --> 01:36:33,640
- I can't do it here.

2522
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:36,430
I can't, your mother's right
outside the door practically.

2523
01:36:36,430 --> 01:36:37,263
I can't.

2524
01:36:37,263 --> 01:36:38,342
- I won't tell.

2525
01:36:38,342 --> 01:36:40,440
- I can't do it here.
- Unzip me, unzip me.

2526
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:43,947
- You can be destroyed,
what did I just say to you?

2527
01:36:45,930 --> 01:36:46,990
What did I just say to you?

2528
01:36:46,990 --> 01:36:48,790
You better get your shit together

2529
01:36:48,790 --> 01:36:51,580
and get your shit together right now, pal.

2530
01:36:51,580 --> 01:36:52,486
Okay?
- All right.

2531
01:36:52,486 --> 01:36:54,150
- Unzip my dress.

2532
01:36:54,150 --> 01:36:55,380
- She's nothing, baby.

2533
01:36:55,380 --> 01:36:56,213
- She's shit.

2534
01:36:56,213 --> 01:36:57,046
- She's nothing.

2535
01:36:57,046 --> 01:36:57,980
- She's shit, fuck her.

2536
01:36:57,980 --> 01:36:59,120
- You're gonna have blondes
crawling outta your ass.

2537
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:01,940
If you know what I'm
talking about, let's get--

2538
01:37:01,940 --> 01:37:03,263
- I don't know what I was thinking.

2539
01:37:03,263 --> 01:37:05,618
- Hurry up, hurry up, okay, okay.

2540
01:37:05,618 --> 01:37:07,035
- Okay, let's go.

2541
01:37:11,187 --> 01:37:13,850
- You know, this whole
goddamn entire network

2542
01:37:13,850 --> 01:37:18,260
was worth more shut down than it is open.

2543
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:19,093
- I know.

2544
01:37:22,930 --> 01:37:24,804
- This Charlie character,
he was brought here.

2545
01:37:24,804 --> 01:37:25,650
- Charlie--

2546
01:37:25,650 --> 01:37:26,836
- To get rid of all these people,

2547
01:37:26,836 --> 01:37:28,177
firing all these people.
- I understand.

2548
01:37:28,177 --> 01:37:30,088
- Now he's having an affair with her.

2549
01:37:30,088 --> 01:37:31,373
- I don't know if he's having an affair.

2550
01:37:31,373 --> 01:37:32,605
- I don't know if he had an affair.

2551
01:37:32,605 --> 01:37:34,119
I don't give a shit he's having an affair.

2552
01:37:34,119 --> 01:37:36,232
All I know is he's not doing
what he came here to do

2553
01:37:36,232 --> 01:37:38,773
and I brought you here to have him do

2554
01:37:38,773 --> 01:37:40,023
what he's supposed to do.

2555
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:43,380
And that's not happening either.

2556
01:37:48,439 --> 01:37:50,111
- Okay, okay.

2557
01:37:50,111 --> 01:37:51,013
- You cut my lip.

2558
01:37:51,013 --> 01:37:51,846
- I did?

2559
01:37:51,846 --> 01:37:55,394
- Am I bleeding?
- Is it bleeding?

2560
01:37:55,394 --> 01:37:57,192
(moaning)

2561
01:37:57,192 --> 01:37:58,192
Oh, my gosh.

2562
01:38:00,293 --> 01:38:02,393
- [Benny] What the fuck is going on here?

2563
01:38:04,060 --> 01:38:05,131
- Jesus Christ.

2564
01:38:05,131 --> 01:38:06,080
- My dress got stuck.

2565
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:08,480
- Oh, really, your dress got stuck?

2566
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:10,560
This is business as usual, I'm sure.

2567
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,226
This is how things work.
- It's not business as usual.

2568
01:38:12,226 --> 01:38:14,310
I don't wanna spoil
everybody's holiday here.

2569
01:38:14,310 --> 01:38:15,244
You know what's going on here.

2570
01:38:15,244 --> 01:38:16,419
- I don't wanna spoil a holiday!

2571
01:38:16,419 --> 01:38:18,339
- I think it's obvious--
- God for-fucking-bid!

2572
01:38:18,339 --> 01:38:20,900
I don't wanna spoil a holiday!

2573
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:21,980
There's obviously--

2574
01:38:21,980 --> 01:38:23,080
- The door was fucking closed.

2575
01:38:23,080 --> 01:38:25,310
This isn't your house.
- Oh, I'm sorry, you're right,

2576
01:38:25,310 --> 01:38:26,354
I shoulda knocked.

2577
01:38:26,354 --> 01:38:28,170
- Benny, my dress, my zipper got--

2578
01:38:28,170 --> 01:38:29,148
- Let me tell you something,

2579
01:38:29,148 --> 01:38:29,981
let me tell you something!

2580
01:38:29,981 --> 01:38:30,920
- Let's get dressed and let's
get the fuck outta here.

2581
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:33,490
- No, no, no, I don't wanna
fucking interrupt you.

2582
01:38:33,490 --> 01:38:35,010
Go ahead and do what you gotta do.

2583
01:38:35,010 --> 01:38:36,804
- No, you're not interrupting
at all, it's fine.

2584
01:38:36,804 --> 01:38:37,677
- You guys have a wonderful time.

2585
01:38:37,677 --> 01:38:38,680
- Benny.
- No, no, no, listen.

2586
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:40,170
You go back to what you were doing.

2587
01:38:40,170 --> 01:38:42,143
- Deal with him before--
- I'm done!

2588
01:38:42,143 --> 01:38:44,000
- You guys decided--

2589
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,690
- Hey, I'm done!
- Good!

2590
01:38:45,690 --> 01:38:46,820
- You can have her, she's all yours.

2591
01:38:46,820 --> 01:38:47,653
Have a great time.
- Great, thank you.

2592
01:38:47,653 --> 01:38:49,800
- I'm going back to fixing this company

2593
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:52,420
and saving the network 'cause
that's what matters to me.

2594
01:38:52,420 --> 01:38:54,083
Bye bye, bye bye.

2595
01:38:54,922 --> 01:38:57,589
(door slamming)

2596
01:38:58,982 --> 01:39:01,090
- [Charlie] Let's get outta
here, what do you got?

2597
01:39:01,090 --> 01:39:03,427
You got something to
put on, what did you do?

2598
01:39:03,427 --> 01:39:06,621
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I
got passionate and you know

2599
01:39:06,621 --> 01:39:07,971
when you get passionate.
- You didn't lock the door?

2600
01:39:07,971 --> 01:39:08,804
- When you kiss somebody and you do

2601
01:39:08,804 --> 01:39:09,937
the lip thing with your front tooth.

2602
01:39:09,937 --> 01:39:11,937
- [Charlie] Why didn't
you lock the fucking door?

2603
01:39:11,937 --> 01:39:13,750
- Charlie's not doing his job.

2604
01:39:13,750 --> 01:39:15,300
What the fuck are you doing here?

2605
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:16,133
- He's a good guy.

2606
01:39:16,133 --> 01:39:16,966
He's got a good heart.

2607
01:39:16,966 --> 01:39:18,970
- He's a good guy? We don't
have any time for good guys.

2608
01:39:18,970 --> 01:39:22,520
The Chinese called me today,
he said the deal is still on

2609
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:25,583
but we only have so many
more days to get this going.

2610
01:39:28,543 --> 01:39:29,376
- My shoes are out there.

2611
01:39:29,376 --> 01:39:31,300
- This Moxie character's
getting in the way too.

2612
01:39:31,300 --> 01:39:33,400
- Well, can she be bought?

2613
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:34,850
What is she worth, can she be bought?

2614
01:39:34,850 --> 01:39:36,310
Have you approached her with that?

2615
01:39:36,310 --> 01:39:37,470
- I don't think this one can be bought.

2616
01:39:37,470 --> 01:39:38,428
- You don't think this,

2617
01:39:38,428 --> 01:39:39,380
anybody can be bought.

2618
01:39:39,380 --> 01:39:41,377
What kind of numbers are
you putting on the table?

2619
01:39:41,377 --> 01:39:43,219
- If we go that way, we
can get out that way.

2620
01:39:43,219 --> 01:39:44,450
- Out the window?

2621
01:39:44,450 --> 01:39:46,617
- Yeah. Let's not go out the window.

2622
01:39:46,617 --> 01:39:48,090
- No, that's a great idea.

2623
01:39:48,090 --> 01:39:49,324
- Go out the window?
- Yeah.

2624
01:39:49,324 --> 01:39:50,157
- Okay.

2625
01:39:51,365 --> 01:39:53,425
If we both die.

2626
01:39:53,425 --> 01:39:55,737
- You're on the first
floor, we're not going die.

2627
01:39:55,737 --> 01:39:56,654
- Oh, okay.

2628
01:39:57,659 --> 01:39:58,884
I love you.

2629
01:39:58,884 --> 01:40:00,151
- Okay.

2630
01:40:00,151 --> 01:40:01,270
I love you too.

2631
01:40:01,270 --> 01:40:04,400
- Can I have everybody's
attention, please!

2632
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,130
For one second.

2633
01:40:06,130 --> 01:40:09,950
I'm sorry to interrupt your
evening and ruin your dinner.

2634
01:40:09,950 --> 01:40:11,930
I think there's some things
that need to be discussed,

2635
01:40:11,930 --> 01:40:14,550
that need to be brought
out in the open here.

2636
01:40:14,550 --> 01:40:19,550
Um, we have all been living
in this fear, this fear,

2637
01:40:20,053 --> 01:40:21,770
since these visitors came,

2638
01:40:21,770 --> 01:40:23,240
these visitors from New York.

2639
01:40:23,240 --> 01:40:24,430
- Hold the window.

2640
01:40:24,430 --> 01:40:25,263
- Who's gonna--

2641
01:40:25,263 --> 01:40:26,096
- Hold the fucking window!

2642
01:40:26,096 --> 01:40:27,280
I wanna get outta here!
- Chill out!

2643
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:28,286
- We've been ducking
or we've been running,

2644
01:40:28,286 --> 01:40:29,834
looking over our shoulder and

2645
01:40:29,834 --> 01:40:32,290
pointing fingers at the next guy.

2646
01:40:32,290 --> 01:40:34,068
- [Charlie] Hold this.

2647
01:40:34,068 --> 01:40:36,167
- [Moxie] Shh, shh, okay.

2648
01:40:36,167 --> 01:40:37,000
All right.

2649
01:40:38,260 --> 01:40:40,250
- And everybody's looking
for this missing money

2650
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:44,390
'cause we wanna know, who
is cutting our lifeblood?

2651
01:40:44,390 --> 01:40:47,500
Why is this happening to us,
because we're a family, right?

2652
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:48,833
Right, we're family?

2653
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:55,910
But it wasn't until this
very moment when I realized

2654
01:40:55,910 --> 01:40:58,870
that my heart was in the wrong place.

2655
01:40:58,870 --> 01:41:02,580
I want you all to know
that I have figured it out.

2656
01:41:02,580 --> 01:41:04,810
I have the answer we've been looking for.

2657
01:41:04,810 --> 01:41:06,010
I know who the thief is!

2658
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:13,090
And this guy, Mr. Big Shot,
the guy who's going to hire

2659
01:41:13,090 --> 01:41:15,520
and fire and tell you where
you're gonna be tomorrow,

2660
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:20,520
Charlie Moon, he's a crook,
and he's in cahoots with Moxie!

2661
01:41:21,230 --> 01:41:23,068
They stole the money together!

2662
01:41:23,068 --> 01:41:23,901
(everyone shouting)

2663
01:41:23,901 --> 01:41:27,233
It kills me to have to say
this, but it's the truth!

2664
01:41:27,233 --> 01:41:28,066
- Moxie didn't steal anything!

2665
01:41:28,066 --> 01:41:30,030
- Benny, Benny--
- That's a bottom-line number!

2666
01:41:30,030 --> 01:41:32,893
- It wasn't Moxie, it wasn't Moxie!

2667
01:41:33,950 --> 01:41:35,000
Don't go blaming her.

2668
01:41:35,850 --> 01:41:37,110
- Who should I blame then?

2669
01:41:37,110 --> 01:41:38,360
Who should I blame, Mack?

2670
01:41:39,394 --> 01:41:40,463
- It was me.

2671
01:41:41,813 --> 01:41:43,950
It was me, I did it, I took it.

2672
01:41:43,950 --> 01:41:46,150
(everyone gasping)

2673
01:41:46,150 --> 01:41:47,520
I was gonna put it back.

2674
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:50,090
I, I was just trying to
figure out how to replace it.

2675
01:41:50,090 --> 01:41:52,387
I got this deal with this

2676
01:41:52,387 --> 01:41:55,604
Japanese promo commercial thing.

2677
01:41:55,604 --> 01:41:59,440
They wanna pay me a ton of
money to have an old guy

2678
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:02,770
go surf huge waves in
Hawaii and get a photograph.

2679
01:42:02,770 --> 01:42:07,040
They put it up on a poster
under a Japanese beer logo and,

2680
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:09,793
and, and, and. (sighing)

2681
01:42:11,010 --> 01:42:11,843
- Why, Mack?

2682
01:42:12,955 --> 01:42:16,490
- You know, you ladies
think you've got the corner

2683
01:42:16,490 --> 01:42:21,323
on the market on change
of life, menopause.

2684
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:24,070
Well, you don't, you know.

2685
01:42:24,070 --> 01:42:26,583
Guys go through something like that too.

2686
01:42:28,050 --> 01:42:29,000
I don't know about you guys,

2687
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:32,073
but this guy goes through that too,

2688
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:37,130
and when everything starts
to change, you know,

2689
01:42:37,130 --> 01:42:40,510
and you're getting, when
everything that defined you,

2690
01:42:40,510 --> 01:42:45,493
that made you feel alive,
like you were living,

2691
01:42:46,460 --> 01:42:50,540
starts to fade away, what
are you gonna do, you know?

2692
01:42:50,540 --> 01:42:52,570
I started doing some stupid shit.

2693
01:42:52,570 --> 01:42:56,010
I started gambling on long shots

2694
01:42:56,010 --> 01:43:01,010
and investing a little
bit and not so wisely

2695
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:05,660
and I started playing
with the stock market.

2696
01:43:05,660 --> 01:43:08,010
The fire in the belly starts to fade

2697
01:43:08,010 --> 01:43:10,070
and the bones start to creak,

2698
01:43:10,070 --> 01:43:12,900
and I live on the juice,
I live on the adrenaline,

2699
01:43:12,900 --> 01:43:14,823
the testosterone, the endorphins.

2700
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:19,940
It's the juice of life,
so I take some risks.

2701
01:43:19,940 --> 01:43:24,940
I have to find some other
way to create the buzz

2702
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:31,463
that I live on because that's what I need.

2703
01:43:33,410 --> 01:43:35,948
I invested on crazy investments.

2704
01:43:35,948 --> 01:43:40,680
I speculated on high-risk stocks

2705
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:44,520
because high risk is
what makes it appealing.

2706
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:49,470
It's what makes me feel
young and happy and alive

2707
01:43:49,470 --> 01:43:54,470
and fucking relevant for a little while,

2708
01:43:56,750 --> 01:43:59,900
but I was always going to put it back.

2709
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:02,090
- Okay, all right, enough, enough!

2710
01:44:02,090 --> 01:44:03,860
We don't need confessions.

2711
01:44:03,860 --> 01:44:04,950
- I know who you are.

2712
01:44:04,950 --> 01:44:05,783
- You do?

2713
01:44:05,783 --> 01:44:06,616
- Yeah, I do.
- Who am I?

2714
01:44:06,616 --> 01:44:08,250
- I know that you're running
the show around here.

2715
01:44:08,250 --> 01:44:09,790
I know I'm not the only one around

2716
01:44:09,790 --> 01:44:11,630
who's been telling some lies, okay?

2717
01:44:11,630 --> 01:44:15,663
- And you're saying it's not
Moxie and Charlie, you did it?

2718
01:44:15,663 --> 01:44:17,680
- I'm not saying it's not
them, I'm saying it is me.

2719
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:19,930
- It is you, and the reason you did it?

2720
01:44:19,930 --> 01:44:20,763
- I told you.

2721
01:44:21,930 --> 01:44:23,870
- We may have to contact the authorities.

2722
01:44:23,870 --> 01:44:26,050
- Well, I probably deserve that.

2723
01:44:26,050 --> 01:44:27,893
- I'm gonna have to get in touch
with corporate, I am sorry.

2724
01:44:27,893 --> 01:44:30,415
- Then you put me in jail if
that's what you need to do

2725
01:44:30,415 --> 01:44:34,340
but know that I did not
mean to hurt anyone.

2726
01:44:34,340 --> 01:44:36,890
- Don't you love an honest man?

2727
01:44:36,890 --> 01:44:39,730
Get over here, come here, come here.

2728
01:44:39,730 --> 01:44:44,730
Oh, my god, you are like
the man I met 20 years ago.

2729
01:44:46,253 --> 01:44:48,798
You know what, let me tell you something.

2730
01:44:48,798 --> 01:44:52,240
I have been, unbeknownst to you,

2731
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:55,340
doing a little Internet
business with my sisters,

2732
01:44:55,340 --> 01:44:58,740
and I have been making
money hand over fist

2733
01:44:58,740 --> 01:45:00,170
and I'm telling you something,

2734
01:45:00,170 --> 01:45:03,000
I'm gonna be able to put
all that money back and more

2735
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,100
and you and I are gonna
talk woman to woman.

2736
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:05,933
- Okay.

2737
01:45:05,933 --> 01:45:10,460
- And you and I are gonna
talk about everything else.

2738
01:45:10,460 --> 01:45:13,570
So let's just enjoy the party, okay?

2739
01:45:13,570 --> 01:45:14,403
Okay?
- What?

2740
01:45:14,403 --> 01:45:16,463
That is so fucked up,
that is so fucked up!

2741
01:45:18,348 --> 01:45:20,507
What the fuck, wait a
minute, wait a minute!

2742
01:45:20,507 --> 01:45:22,870
You people are all just
going to be okay with that?

2743
01:45:22,870 --> 01:45:25,203
No, no, fuck this shit!

2744
01:45:25,203 --> 01:45:28,730
No, no, I'm sorry, I am not
just gonna be complacent.

2745
01:45:28,730 --> 01:45:31,040
- There's sometimes
change you can't control.

2746
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:32,063
Just shut up, man.

2747
01:45:43,374 --> 01:45:44,787
- What kind of business?

2748
01:45:44,787 --> 01:45:46,260
- What kind of business?

2749
01:45:46,260 --> 01:45:47,093
Vibrators.

2750
01:45:47,093 --> 01:45:48,410
- Oh my god!

2751
01:45:48,410 --> 01:45:50,917
We really gotta talk.

2752
01:45:50,917 --> 01:45:52,616
- And listen, have you ever heard a man

2753
01:45:52,616 --> 01:45:54,187
talk about menopause before?

2754
01:45:54,187 --> 01:45:55,150
- No, no, no.

2755
01:45:55,150 --> 01:45:57,024
- Are you going through it?
- Are you going through it?

2756
01:45:57,024 --> 01:45:58,640
- Yes, I am.
- It's fucking crazy, right?

2757
01:45:58,640 --> 01:45:59,523
- My mind is gone.

2758
01:45:59,523 --> 01:46:02,560
- Johnnie, I'm in the
shed, can you hear me?

2759
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:04,370
Can you hear me, okay, good.

2760
01:46:04,370 --> 01:46:06,160
Okay, now switch to router
six where you'll see

2761
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:09,350
Moxie and Charlie Moon, that's
the inside of the TV studio

2762
01:46:09,350 --> 01:46:10,990
where you linked those cameras up.

2763
01:46:10,990 --> 01:46:13,320
- I feel like I'm having
some kind of thing,

2764
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:14,990
you know, like a--

2765
01:46:14,990 --> 01:46:16,190
- Existential crisis?

2766
01:46:16,190 --> 01:46:17,812
- No, what is that?

2767
01:46:17,812 --> 01:46:19,850
- Existential crisis. (laughing)

2768
01:46:19,850 --> 01:46:21,430
Whatever you're going through right now.

2769
01:46:21,430 --> 01:46:23,369
- What are you talking
about, existential crisis?

2770
01:46:23,369 --> 01:46:24,850
- (laughing) Oh my god.

2771
01:46:24,850 --> 01:46:25,683
- What does that mean?

2772
01:46:25,683 --> 01:46:27,080
- You need so much help.

2773
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:29,951
- I feel like I'm on the verge
of like something's gonna,

2774
01:46:29,951 --> 01:46:31,539
like something's--
- That's good!

2775
01:46:31,539 --> 01:46:32,673
- I feel like something's gonna--

2776
01:46:32,673 --> 01:46:34,108
- That's good! (laughing)

2777
01:46:34,108 --> 01:46:36,010
- You know, like I'm on helium,
that's what I feel like.

2778
01:46:36,010 --> 01:46:37,820
Helium, like a balloon.

2779
01:46:37,820 --> 01:46:38,653
- Helium?
- Does that make sense?

2780
01:46:38,653 --> 01:46:39,491
- That's so good, yes!

2781
01:46:39,491 --> 01:46:40,370
- Is that a good thing?
- Yes!

2782
01:46:40,370 --> 01:46:43,190
- Now we're gonna switch it
over to Moxie's living room,

2783
01:46:43,190 --> 01:46:44,023
router three.

2784
01:46:45,210 --> 01:46:47,870
Yeah, that's right, okay.

2785
01:46:47,870 --> 01:46:49,150
- Goodbye, everybody!

2786
01:46:49,150 --> 01:46:49,983
- Bye!

2787
01:46:49,983 --> 01:46:53,650
- I love you, have each other
and your corrupt crazy ways!

2788
01:46:53,650 --> 01:46:55,330
- Now switch back to router six.

2789
01:46:55,330 --> 01:46:57,100
- That's how I've lived
my life, you understand?

2790
01:46:57,100 --> 01:46:58,590
- All right, I get it.
- It's always looking.

2791
01:46:58,590 --> 01:46:59,423
It's always looking to

2792
01:46:59,423 --> 01:47:00,803
protect and this edge and--

2793
01:47:00,803 --> 01:47:02,276
- I just got my period.

2794
01:47:02,276 --> 01:47:04,520
- What, is that a good thing?

2795
01:47:04,520 --> 01:47:05,810
- I just dropped an egg,

2796
01:47:05,810 --> 01:47:07,120
I don't know.

2797
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:09,850
I don't know how long I
can have this conversation.

2798
01:47:09,850 --> 01:47:11,840
I need to insert something.

2799
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:13,623
- Here, sit on this.

2800
01:47:13,623 --> 01:47:14,750
- Sit on that!

2801
01:47:14,750 --> 01:47:18,270
I'm about to get major
cramps, do you understand?

2802
01:47:18,270 --> 01:47:19,103
- Then lean back.

2803
01:47:19,103 --> 01:47:19,936
- No!

2804
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:20,769
Okay.

2805
01:47:20,769 --> 01:47:21,602
- Just lean back.

2806
01:47:21,602 --> 01:47:23,560
(sobbing)

2807
01:47:23,560 --> 01:47:27,120
- I just wanna lie here and bleed.

2808
01:47:27,120 --> 01:47:29,470
- Now, we're gonna switch it
over to Moxie's living room

2809
01:47:29,470 --> 01:47:33,357
where her mother and aunts
are right now watching TV.

2810
01:47:33,357 --> 01:47:37,357
("Battle Hymn of the Republic")

2811
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:43,041
- Oh!

2812
01:47:46,598 --> 01:47:47,562
Yay!

2813
01:47:47,562 --> 01:47:49,199
(laughing)

2814
01:47:49,199 --> 01:47:51,270
(clapping)

2815
01:47:51,270 --> 01:47:53,970
- I used to be a girl, I always
referred to myself as a girl

2816
01:47:53,970 --> 01:47:55,960
and now I'm a woman and I love it.

2817
01:47:55,960 --> 01:47:59,280
Menopause, for me, has
actually forced me into healing

2818
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:01,690
a lot of stuff that I hadn't
dealt with in my life.

2819
01:48:01,690 --> 01:48:04,029
- I don't feel like I have to
be as nurturing any longer.

2820
01:48:04,029 --> 01:48:07,143
I don't feel like I have to
be everybody's caregiver.

2821
01:48:07,143 --> 01:48:08,270
I feel liberated.

2822
01:48:08,270 --> 01:48:12,380
- I would much rather have 100 hot flashes

2823
01:48:12,380 --> 01:48:16,190
than one day of the
cramps that I used to have

2824
01:48:16,190 --> 01:48:18,430
when I had it, I was doubled over in pain

2825
01:48:18,430 --> 01:48:21,901
for two to three of the
seven days of my period.

2826
01:48:21,901 --> 01:48:24,478
- Menopause, for me, is the change,

2827
01:48:24,478 --> 01:48:27,220
which they call it the change, of life,

2828
01:48:27,220 --> 01:48:29,160
and really finding my authentic self.

2829
01:48:29,160 --> 01:48:30,860
- I feel like more of a woman.

2830
01:48:30,860 --> 01:48:34,100
I feel more vital, more alive, more happy.

2831
01:48:34,100 --> 01:48:36,243
- I feel more invigorated
by life than I think I have

2832
01:48:36,243 --> 01:48:39,910
in 20 years and probably
because I have lived

2833
01:48:39,910 --> 01:48:43,060
in service to other people
for most of the past 20 years.

2834
01:48:43,060 --> 01:48:45,466
I've lived in service to
my husband, to his career.

2835
01:48:45,466 --> 01:48:48,021
I've lived in service to my
children, to their education,

2836
01:48:48,021 --> 01:48:50,390
and now it's about me.

2837
01:48:50,390 --> 01:48:52,790
- We're wise women now,
we just need a culture

2838
01:48:52,790 --> 01:48:54,430
that values wise women.

2839
01:48:54,430 --> 01:48:56,750
- Now I've heard about
the atrophy of the vagina

2840
01:48:56,750 --> 01:48:58,850
and I say if you don't
want a muscle to atrophy,

2841
01:48:58,850 --> 01:49:00,120
you exercise it. (laughing)

2842
01:49:00,120 --> 01:49:01,657
I mean, it's the best thing to do.

2843
01:49:01,657 --> 01:49:02,950
- You do have to exercise it.

2844
01:49:02,950 --> 01:49:05,540
I have Bob, my battery-operated boyfriend.

2845
01:49:05,540 --> 01:49:09,170
- My vibrator, called Brutus,
is a monkey with a banana,

2846
01:49:09,170 --> 01:49:12,890
holding a banana, and the
monkey does certain things

2847
01:49:12,890 --> 01:49:15,544
and the banana does very, very nice things

2848
01:49:15,544 --> 01:49:18,027
and I don't have to beg it for sex,

2849
01:49:18,027 --> 01:49:20,300
I don't have to plead with it for sex,

2850
01:49:20,300 --> 01:49:22,530
I don't have to say, "I'm tired tonight."

2851
01:49:22,530 --> 01:49:26,470
Whenever I feel like it,
it's a wonderful experience.

2852
01:49:26,470 --> 01:49:29,400
- Except it can't write
a check. (laughing)

2853
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:31,134
- I don't understand
where my body is going.

2854
01:49:31,134 --> 01:49:33,065
My breasts are going to my waist,

2855
01:49:33,065 --> 01:49:35,810
my ass is gonna end up on the floor,

2856
01:49:35,810 --> 01:49:39,000
I have veins in my legs, I
don't have veins in my legs,

2857
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,760
my grandmother has veins in her legs.

2858
01:49:40,760 --> 01:49:42,720
- Okay, now switch to
router two, the studio.

2859
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:44,737
- I still don't know
what God was thinking!

2860
01:49:44,737 --> 01:49:47,010
(Moxie screaming)

2861
01:49:47,010 --> 01:49:48,050
- [Charlie] What is the address?

2862
01:49:48,050 --> 01:49:49,604
- What is happening here?
- Oh my god!

2863
01:49:49,604 --> 01:49:52,619
- Put it down, put it down.
- Is that Moxie?

2864
01:49:52,619 --> 01:49:53,453
- It is, what is going on?
- She's on TV.

2865
01:49:54,760 --> 01:49:55,593
- Hello?

2866
01:49:56,470 --> 01:49:58,277
- Yes, yes, it's working.

2867
01:49:58,277 --> 01:49:59,707
- Put it down, put it down!

2868
01:49:59,707 --> 01:50:00,880
- Put the fucking phone down!

2869
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:01,930
- Okay, it's down, it's down!

2870
01:50:01,930 --> 01:50:04,892
- Let me decide if I
want a goddamn ambulance.

2871
01:50:04,892 --> 01:50:05,804
- You said you wanted--

2872
01:50:05,804 --> 01:50:07,760
- I can't watch this.
- Oh, my god, darling.

2873
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:08,847
- I gotta hear a sorry,

2874
01:50:08,847 --> 01:50:09,680
I gotta hear a sorry.

2875
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:10,720
- There's nothing more to tell.

2876
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:11,553
- Okay, well, tell it again.

2877
01:50:11,553 --> 01:50:13,630
- [Lulu] Oh, she's finally got her period.

2878
01:50:13,630 --> 01:50:15,176
- God, you poor baby.

2879
01:50:15,176 --> 01:50:17,000
(Moxie groaning)

2880
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:17,857
- Put your feet up.

2881
01:50:17,857 --> 01:50:19,060
- No!

2882
01:50:19,060 --> 01:50:20,110
Don't touch anything!

2883
01:50:20,110 --> 01:50:21,531
- [Lulu] I'm so glad I'm over that.

2884
01:50:21,531 --> 01:50:22,859
- No more periods.

2885
01:50:22,859 --> 01:50:23,890
- Oh, my god.

2886
01:50:23,890 --> 01:50:24,723
Ever, ever.

2887
01:50:24,723 --> 01:50:26,450
- Okay, a few hot flashes.

2888
01:50:26,450 --> 01:50:27,283
- I really love you.
- Do you want me--

2889
01:50:27,283 --> 01:50:28,563
- I love you so much.

2890
01:50:29,874 --> 01:50:31,207
- Do you want me to get you something?

2891
01:50:31,207 --> 01:50:32,040
- Kiss me.

2892
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:35,920
- Oh my god.

2893
01:50:39,930 --> 01:50:41,348
- I'm hoping I still have a job and I--

2894
01:50:41,348 --> 01:50:45,598

love affair left somehow.

2960
01:53:44,940 --> 01:53:48,390
- I have had more men who
have been pursuing me,

2961
01:53:48,390 --> 01:53:50,420
flattering me, flirting with me in a way

2962
01:53:50,420 --> 01:53:51,710
that hasn't happened before.

2963
01:53:51,710 --> 01:53:55,360
- I have not slept in
six years, six years.

2964
01:53:55,360 --> 01:53:56,708
- I woke up and I was drenched.

2965
01:53:56,708 --> 01:53:58,510
- And then that was it
and then I got my period.

2966
01:53:58,510 --> 01:54:01,190
- It is a scientific
fact that people who have

2967
01:54:01,190 --> 01:54:03,870
gone through menopause
have fewer migraines.

2968
01:54:03,870 --> 01:54:07,000
- Or you wanna have an orgasm
or you can have an orgasm or

2969
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:08,530
you don't want to have an orgasm.

2970
01:54:08,530 --> 01:54:10,040
You do wanna have an orgasm.

2971
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:12,910
- Imagine, we have not
been able to control

2972
01:54:12,910 --> 01:54:15,922
our reproductivity as a
human species for very long.

2973
01:54:15,922 --> 01:54:18,104
Think of the relief that women felt when

2974
01:54:18,104 --> 01:54:19,614
finally it was over.

2975
01:54:19,614 --> 01:54:23,536
I just feel like that
part of my life is over

2976
01:54:23,536 --> 01:54:27,570
and I like to think of myself as a tree

2977
01:54:27,570 --> 01:54:30,113
whose foliage is going into full color

2978
01:54:30,113 --> 01:54:32,920

2979
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:35,040

01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:37,370
I think it's very exciting actually.
