1
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,520
<i>For centuries the sacred magic</i>
<i> of the divine crystal</i>

2
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:24,356
<i> blessed our world</i>
<i> and its people.</i>

3
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:34,233
<i>But in time the promise of its</i>
<i>power brought war to our lands.</i>

4
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:42,775
<i> Lucis, a peaceful kingdom</i>
<i> of great magic</i>

5
00:00:42,777 --> 00:00:45,544
<i> kept safe by the power</i>
<i> of the crystal.</i>

6
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:50,783
<i> And niflheim, a military</i>
<i> empire of vast machinery</i>

7
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:53,752
<i> made strong by</i>
<i> the might of its magitek.</i>

8
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:57,356
<i> Long has war</i>
<i> raged between the two.</i>

9
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,695
<i> As the years passed, niflheim</i>
<i> marched on nearby nations</i>

10
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:06,498
<i> driven by its unsurpassed</i>
<i> technology.</i>

11
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:12,704
<i> To defend itself,</i>
<i> lucis raised a magical wall</i>

12
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:17,209
<i> the strength of which comes</i>
<i> from the crystal itself.</i>

13
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:18,911
<i> Insomnia alone,</i>

14
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:21,713
<i>the crown city and last bastion</i>
<i> of Lucian defense</i>

15
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:25,150
<i> remained beyond niflheim</i>
<i> reach for many years.</i>

16
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,222
<i> Amid the escalating war</i>

17
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:32,724
<i> prince noctis of lucis</i>
<i> had come to tenebrae</i>

18
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:35,761
<i> to seek healing</i>
<i> for a grievous injury.</i>

19
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,196
<i> He made the long journey</i>

20
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:40,666
<i> together with his father,</i>
<i> king Regis.</i>

21
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:44,069
<i> Mother, brother, and I,</i>
<i> the royalty of tenebrae</i>

22
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:46,638
<i> had all welcomed their visit.</i>

23
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,188
<i> It was then</i>
<i> that the fires came,</i>

24
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,857
<i> everywhere and all at once.</i>

25
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:11,330
<i> In a mere instant, the whole</i>
<i> of tenebrae was ablaze.</i>

26
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:15,300
Ravus!

27
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,644
Mother!

28
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,588
General glauca.

29
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,730
<i> The niflheim attack</i>
<i> was an attempt</i>

30
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:47,666
<i> on the lives of the visiting</i>
<i> Lucian royalty.</i>

31
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:55,174
Noctis!

32
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:01,346
Please. Help us!

33
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,182
King Regis!

34
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:18,897
Lunafreya...

35
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,704
Luna!

36
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:29,174
<i> From that day until this day,</i>

37
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:33,145
<i> tenebrae has been gripped</i>
<i> in the iron fist of niflheim,</i>

38
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:35,814
<i> sworn enemy of lucis.</i>

39
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:42,421
<i> King Regis assembles</i>
<i> a force of mighty warriors</i>

40
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:45,057
<i>to combat the imperial menace.</i>

41
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:46,491
<i> Dubbed the kingsglaive,</i>

42
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:49,361
<i> they fight relentlessly</i>
<i> against niflheim,</i>

43
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:52,264
<i> empowered by the magic</i>
<i> of their sovereign.</i>

44
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:07,512
All units,
move to secure the wall.

45
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:09,615
If they break through,
we're done.

46
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:40,112
What's the hold-up,
Crowe?

47
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:42,914
<i> Crowe! Status?</i>

48
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,684
Almost there.

49
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,720
No!

50
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:54,726
<i>- I need help.</i>
<i>- East wall's going down.</i>

51
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:57,296
<i> Pelna, can you get to me?</i>

52
00:04:57,298 --> 00:05:00,899
Lucis isn't
paying us refugees enough...

53
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,234
For this.

54
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,384
How is this fair?

55
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,293
- Nyx, I owe you one.
- You and everyone else.

56
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:31,530
<i> We need support on the east</i>
<i> flank. Nyx, where are you?</i>

57
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:32,864
I'm on my way.

58
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:36,234
Pelna, fall back
and regroup with the others.

59
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:37,636
Go easy on the magic, hero.

60
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:39,604
You got people
waiting for you back home.

61
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,773
I'm worth the wait.

62
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:46,011
Show-off.

63
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,622
<i> Watch your back, libertus.</i>

64
00:05:57,624 --> 00:06:00,492
<i> We got more incoming.</i>

65
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:02,994
We ain't gonna last much longer.

66
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,566
Crowe!

67
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,102
Yes!

68
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:19,478
<i>- All glaives, fall back.</i>
<i>- Repeat, all glaives fall back!</i>

69
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,559
Release the daemon.

70
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:31,543
<i>We can't take down that daemon.</i>

71
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:34,212
<i> I'm ordering a full retreat.</i>

72
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:37,549
<i> Get back here alive.</i>
<i> That's an order.</i>

73
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:39,751
<i> For hearth and home.</i>

74
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:56,635
<i> All units, fall back</i>
<i> to the extraction point.</i>

75
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:59,070
<i> Support is inbound.</i>

76
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,776
Nyx! We have to get out of here.

77
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:07,913
Nyx! We have orders!

78
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:09,114
Yeah.

79
00:09:09,116 --> 00:09:10,315
Help!

80
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:11,516
Nyx!

81
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:14,152
Oh, that idiot.

82
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,692
Nyx!

83
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:24,362
Crowe. We gotta move.

84
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:26,631
You gotta be kidding me.

85
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,164
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

86
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,466
You know I ain't got
the stomach for this crap.

87
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:04,836
Would you rather walk?

88
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:08,173
Come on. Just like galahd
canyon back home.

89
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,853
Libertus!

90
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,344
Luche, report.

91
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:50,749
The imperial forces
look to be withdrawing, sir.

92
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,269
Guess I owe
you another one.

93
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,038
I'll put it on your tab.

94
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,007
You just try and get some rest,
all right?

95
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:34,025
You disobeyed
a direct order to retreat.

96
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,761
For hearth and home,
right, sir?

97
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:39,631
As long as I got
strength in my body,

98
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:42,233
I obey that order.

99
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,903
Don't fool yourself,
nyx Ulric.

100
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:48,406
Whatever strength you have
is on loan from the king.

101
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:50,775
You are nothing without him.

102
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:54,312
Await details
of your reassignment.

103
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,148
Yes, your majesty.

104
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,984
Despite their victory
all but assured.

105
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:11,556
A sudden
and inexplicable retreat.

106
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:13,424
We are at risk nonetheless,
your majesty.

107
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:16,728
We cannot know
when they will strike again.

108
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,264
Your majesty,
word from the west gate.

109
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:21,533
A man claiming to be an envoy
of the empire

110
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,935
requests an audience.

111
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:30,275
The envoy from niflheim awaits
without, your majesty.

112
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,714
Hello there.

113
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:38,817
Hello!

114
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:40,485
Good day to you...

115
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,821
And you.

116
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:45,089
Well met, my dear Lucians.

117
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:47,358
Has niflheim grown so bold

118
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,763
that they send the chancellor
himself as envoy?

119
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:53,798
And under no guard, at that?

120
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,136
It is an honor to be recognized
by the great king Regis.

121
00:13:58,138 --> 00:14:00,839
Yet, permit me
to stand on ceremony

122
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:03,374
and introduce myself
nonetheless.

123
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:08,880
Ardyn izunia,
chancellor of niflheim

124
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:12,550
at your humble service.

125
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:14,419
And I come to you on this

126
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:19,891
most auspicious of days
to offer terms of peace.

127
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:21,192
Peace?

128
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,261
As you no doubt surmised,

129
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:28,967
that recent maneuver of ours
was no strategic retreat.

130
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:30,835
Call it...

131
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:34,806
A gesture of imperial goodwill.

132
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:37,408
Like you, we wish nothing more

133
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:42,714
than to bring a swift end
to this senseless war.

134
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,782
Is that so?

135
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:46,117
It is, indeed.

136
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:49,287
And we require but
a singular compliance.

137
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:53,658
Save your grand insomnia here.

138
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:58,830
Lucis must forfeit all
territories to niflheim rule.

139
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:01,566
Hmph.

140
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:04,202
Ah. Insomnia!

141
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:08,773
The Jewel in the crown
of the Lucian kingdom.

142
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:11,109
How foolish of me
to forget.

143
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:15,513
There is just
one more trivial thing.

144
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:17,248
It concerns your son.

145
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:22,186
The fetching
prince noctis of lucis

146
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:26,157
and the fair Princess lunafreya
of tenebrae...

147
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,560
They are to be wed.

148
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:33,131
You seem vexed,
your highness.

149
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:35,266
I assure you,

150
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:39,504
the Princess still holds you
in the highest regard

151
00:15:39,506 --> 00:15:43,341
as she has done
all these 12 long years.

152
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,892
Don't know
if anyone's told you,

153
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:04,696
but we don't take kindly
to insubordination around here.

154
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:11,169
Do yourself a favor,
take a look around.

155
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:15,707
This is what a hundred years
of peace looks like.

156
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:24,382
It's a lasting peace made by
the wall and the wall alone.

157
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:30,588
See, we don't need
any of you immigrants

158
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:35,693
jumping around,
playing war hero.

159
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,496
Hey! Rough day
on the gate, huh, glaive?

160
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:14,599
You jerk. It's your fault
he got stuck there.

161
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:15,800
Aah!

162
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:18,069
Not a very nice
welcome for a big hero.

163
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:20,204
Not a very nice outfit
for one, either.

164
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:23,207
I think it brings out my eyes.

165
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:26,944
Unh! What'd you put in this?

166
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:28,346
Tastes like a chocobo turd.

167
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:30,014
Hey,
shut your trap!

168
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:32,784
This ain't galahd. That's the
way folks around here like it.

169
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:34,652
Oh, well. I'm glad
to see you're willing

170
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:37,955
to sell out our heritage
for a few extra Gil.

171
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:41,325
Hey, libertus. You thank nyx
for saving your life yet?

172
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:43,828
Oh, come on, Crowe. Nyx
and I are too close for that.

173
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:47,365
He helps me, I help him.
That's the way it's always been.

174
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:50,201
Looks like you got little help
from something else, huh?

175
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:52,937
I need all I can get.

176
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:55,273
For hearth!

177
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:57,108
And home.
And home.

178
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:03,147
So, nyx the gatekeeper.
How's the new post treating you?

179
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:05,349
Oh, it's amazing.
You guys would love it.

180
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:07,285
The gate watch are real
sweethearts.

181
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:09,287
Ha-ha-ha. Yeah, right.

182
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:12,123
We all know they hate us
outsiders more than anything.

183
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,692
So bored they
got nothing better to do.

184
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:16,160
Boredom's not so bad.

185
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:17,829
Means there's peace, at least.

186
00:18:17,831 --> 00:18:21,232
I'd fight a hundred more wars
for galahdans to know boredom.

187
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:22,800
Fight all you want.

188
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:24,836
Just don't go dying yet.

189
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:27,538
I still owe you. A lot.

190
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,074
Where would the glaive be
without its hero?

191
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:33,244
Can you not talk like this
while we're drinking, please?

192
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:34,745
Besides, we just sent the niffs

193
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:37,148
running with their tails
between their legs, right?

194
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:41,119
They weren't running from us.
No, they were toying with us.

195
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:43,087
Stop being such a buzzkill,
luche.

196
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,889
We all know
what happened.

197
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:47,725
Did you know they sent an envoy
to the citadel after that?

198
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:50,528
What for? To offer
their surrender?

199
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,163
- More like demand ours.
- What?

200
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:54,665
Demand?
My ass!

201
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,434
No? Think about it.

202
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:58,503
The empire's got lucis
on its last legs.

203
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:01,239
It's the perfect time
to make demands.

204
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:05,810
We are losing this war,
your majesty.

205
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,980
Lucis cannot rely
on the kingsglaive alone.

206
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:12,650
Accepting the truce may be
our best course of action.

207
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,319
You speak of matters
beyond the new wall.

208
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:19,390
We have no need of a truce here,
so long as it stands.

209
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:23,728
And if our position worsens,
we still have the old wall.

210
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:29,934
Yes, but this truce will end
the fighting altogether.

211
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:32,270
If only we could
compromise--

212
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:34,305
compromise is unwise.

213
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:37,742
We know nothing
of niflheim's true intentions.

214
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:41,646
Do not fool yourselves. The
walls are far from impenetrable.

215
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:45,483
The paths left to us are few.

216
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:48,553
The new wall draws its power
from the throne.

217
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:51,989
I am able to sustain it
for some years yet,

218
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:54,358
if the kingdom requires it.

219
00:19:54,360 --> 00:20:00,464
But the chancellor spoke
one truth, if only one.

220
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:05,069
We are old, and the old wall...

221
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:09,440
I cannot command the old wall
with a weakened hand,

222
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:10,975
nor do I have the strength

223
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:13,744
to muster an offensive
to turn the tide on this war.

224
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:17,481
Then let the choice be made,
your majesty.

225
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:20,451
What are
we to protect?

226
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,308
<i> Help, mother!</i>

227
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:05,930
How come you never
lose your lunch like that?

228
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:08,933
Just doesn't add up.

229
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,268
Here's this ancient art,

230
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,570
secret of the royal family
and all that.

231
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:15,506
Libertus! Nyx!

232
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:18,042
Come here, guys,
you gotta see this.

233
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:20,077
<i> Things were hectic</i>
<i> in the capital today</i>

234
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:22,280
<i> as the Lucian government</i>
<i> announced full acceptance</i>

235
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:24,882
<i> of what some are criticizing</i>
<i> as the unilateral peace terms</i>

236
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:27,285
<i> proposed by chancellor</i>
<i> izunia of niflheim.</i>

237
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:28,753
<i> The signing of the truce</i>

238
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:30,621
<i> will see power over</i>
<i> all Lucian territories</i>

239
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:31,956
<i> transferred to the empire,</i>

240
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,958
<i> with the sole exception</i>
<i> of insomnia.</i>

241
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,627
<i> In return, niflheim</i>
<i>guarantees the continued safety</i>

242
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,562
<i>of insomnia and its citizenry,</i>

243
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:40,798
<i> as well as a cessation</i>
<i> to all hostilities</i>

244
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,201
<i> bringing a decisive end</i>
<i> to this long and bitter war.</i>

245
00:21:46,572 --> 00:21:51,709
All that fighting we did.
All for nothing.

246
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:56,881
Glaives.
Assemble in the briefing room.

247
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:59,517
Now.

248
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:08,125
The king has spoken,
and you have heard.

249
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:09,560
All lands beyond the wall

250
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:11,529
are to be relinquished
to the empire.

251
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:13,631
Will
no regions be spared?

252
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:16,801
None.
But your home's out there too!

253
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:18,102
It is.

254
00:22:18,104 --> 00:22:20,104
Why would the king do this?

255
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:21,906
Because it'll end this damn war.

256
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,609
Crowe.
Sir!

257
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:29,847
Prepare to deploy. You're being
sent to infiltrate tenebrae.

258
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,382
Tenebrae, sir?

259
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:33,984
Mission details are classified.

260
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:37,822
Report to my office for briefing
in 30 minutes.

261
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,657
And, nyx...

262
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,359
You're off the west gate.

263
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:45,029
You've been reassigned
to the castle guard.

264
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:47,565
That is all.

265
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:56,540
So this is what you were
talking about, luche?

266
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:57,742
You heard
the captain.

267
00:22:57,744 --> 00:22:59,310
This wasn't
our decision to make.

268
00:22:59,312 --> 00:23:01,412
Not ours to make?

269
00:23:01,414 --> 00:23:03,981
Those are our homes
out there! Our people!

270
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:06,550
And you're just gonna go along
with this and abandon them?

271
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:07,985
If we don't go along with them

272
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:10,788
the empire will unleash
all hell on insomnia.

273
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,456
We'll unleash it
right back at them!

274
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,959
Easy, easy.
He's not the enemy.

275
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:18,095
Don't you get it?

276
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:19,864
We're nothing to them.

277
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:24,535
Rats, snuck in
from beyond the wall.

278
00:23:24,537 --> 00:23:26,537
Sure, they had a use for us

279
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:28,806
when they realized
we could work their magic.

280
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:31,709
So they handpicked us out from
all the other rats out there

281
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:34,678
and just let us nibble away

282
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,281
at his royal
majesty's precious power.

283
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:39,650
But as soon as
this war's all over,

284
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:42,219
it's back to the sewers
for all of us.

285
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:46,056
That means you too, hero.

286
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:48,125
You missing home so much,
libertus,

287
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:52,062
why don't you
and nyx head on back?

288
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:54,765
I'm sure niflheim will
welcome you with open arms.

289
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,468
You've got a home out there too.

290
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:01,772
Or did you forget?

291
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:11,549
Unh! Damn it!

292
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:13,984
I'm not gonna
let it end like this.

293
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:22,359
It is said sentiment amongst
the people is favorable,

294
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:23,561
your majesty.

295
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:25,262
Most all will
welcome this peace.

296
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:27,665
If you yourself
have not heard their voices

297
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:29,800
how can you claim
to know their hearts?

298
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,837
What of the mission to tenebrae,
your majesty?

299
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:35,206
Is such clandestine action wise?

300
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:38,209
If discovered, it will only
serve to provoke the empire.

301
00:24:38,211 --> 00:24:41,645
The empire remains our enemy
until the treaty is signed.

302
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:43,247
So long as
we are at war,

303
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:46,851
his majesty intends to remain
one step ahead of them.

304
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:49,086
Of course.

305
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,032
A hairpin? I didn't think you
were into that kind of thing.

306
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:05,102
It's not for me. It's
a gift for the Princess.

307
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:08,038
But keep that quiet.
Nobody's supposed to know.

308
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:12,843
Well, that's me.

309
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,979
Watch your back
out there.

310
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:17,915
I know you're sick of hearing
it, but you're like a little--

311
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:22,653
little sister to you.
Yeah, I am sick of hearing it.

312
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:27,825
Just make sure you come back
in one piece, all right?

313
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,229
Says the guy in two pieces.

314
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,488
Lady lunafreya, I have
left the rear gate open.

315
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,923
Thank you.

316
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:03,060
Must you go?

317
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,295
Yes.

318
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:08,265
Then go quickly.

319
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:14,838
I do not recall
granting you permission

320
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,141
to leave your quarters,
lunafreya.

321
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:19,310
Ravus.

322
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,715
You are not
to leave this room again

323
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:26,517
until the journey to lucis.

324
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:28,652
It is for your own good.

325
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:32,222
My own good?

326
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:35,993
What is truly going on here?

327
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:39,430
What cause does the empire have
to see me wed to noctis?

328
00:26:39,432 --> 00:26:40,831
They have offered a peace,

329
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,967
and your marriage
is the olive branch.

330
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:45,002
You expect me to believe that?

331
00:26:45,004 --> 00:26:47,538
What you believe
does not concern me.

332
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,506
What does concern me
is you sneaking off

333
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:50,874
to go and tell
our mother's killer

334
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:53,043
about some plot
you've dreamt up.

335
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:56,347
You are wrong
to hate king Regis.

336
00:26:56,349 --> 00:27:00,117
Niflheim killed mother,
not him.

337
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:03,754
They murdered her
and made you their lapdog.

338
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:28,312
It's done.

339
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:04,948
<i> An air of jubilation</i>
<i> has swept the city</i>

340
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,184
<i> in anticipation</i>
<i> of the coming armistice.</i>

341
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,920
<i>With only three days remaining</i>
<i> until the peace</i>

342
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:11,622
<i> is officially</i>
<i> signed into effect,</i>

343
00:28:11,624 --> 00:28:15,259
<i> throngs of citizens have taken</i>
<i> to the streets to show...</i>

344
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:25,469
<i> Lucis needs your strength,</i>
<i> young warriors.</i>

345
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:28,272
<i> We don't need</i>
<i> any of you immigrants.</i>

346
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:31,341
<i> Whatever strength you have</i>
<i> is on loan from the king.</i>

347
00:28:31,343 --> 00:28:34,945
<i> You are nothing without him. </i>
Woman:<i> Nyx, help mother.</i>

348
00:28:34,947 --> 00:28:36,980
<i> Selena, get down.</i>

349
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:40,417
<i> --And the waves of imperial</i>
<i> diplomats entering the city.</i>

350
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:45,756
The Princess? Are you certain?

351
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:47,758
Yes, your majesty.

352
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,227
She was amongst the last
of the imperial contingent

353
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,162
to enter the city.

354
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,187
Get in.

355
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:21,158
I'm reporting to my post now
though, sir.

356
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,793
New orders.

357
00:29:22,795 --> 00:29:26,296
Come on. We've got
a Princess to pick up.

358
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:34,772
Nice ride, sir.

359
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:37,040
It belongs to the prince.

360
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:39,209
We've taken him
outside the city.

361
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:43,013
Doesn't he have
a wedding to plan, sir?

362
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:45,716
Cut the "sir" crap.

363
00:29:45,718 --> 00:29:47,818
The king
has a plan of his own.

364
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,820
Prince noctis
and Princess lunafreya

365
00:29:49,822 --> 00:29:51,555
are to meet
far from insomnia.

366
00:29:51,557 --> 00:29:54,057
What's she doing here then?

367
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,894
Complicating things.

368
00:29:56,896 --> 00:29:58,762
We sent Crowe
to find the Princess

369
00:29:58,764 --> 00:30:01,565
and escort her out of tenebrae.

370
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:06,136
We're still trying
to figure out what went wrong.

371
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:20,818
So I know what
you think about this war,

372
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,954
but what do you think
about this peace?

373
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:28,392
You happy giving up
your home?

374
00:30:28,394 --> 00:30:31,895
It's the king's decision.
I owe him for taking me in.

375
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:35,699
I was lucky. There are people
in galahd who weren't.

376
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:38,035
And they need me.

377
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:40,437
So you're going back?

378
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:43,373
What good will you be
without the king's magic?

379
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:49,346
Yeah, always wanting
to save somebody.

380
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:52,416
I get it. Believe me.
But it doesn't win wars.

381
00:30:52,418 --> 00:30:54,885
It's not just wanting.

382
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:57,354
It's not just me.

383
00:30:57,356 --> 00:31:00,390
Libertus is the one
you need to worry about.

384
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:03,260
He'll go back
if things get worse.

385
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:07,497
The worst
is yet to come.

386
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:30,420
Do you have any idea
who you're stopping?

387
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:34,191
Open this gate now, and maybe
you'll have a job tomorrow.

388
00:31:34,193 --> 00:31:37,261
King's orders.
Are you sure you want to risk

389
00:31:37,263 --> 00:31:40,197
a diplomatic issue now,
of all times?

390
00:31:40,199 --> 00:31:44,534
I am the personal escort
of lady lunafreya nox fleuret,

391
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:47,237
Princess of
the former tenebrae and--

392
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:50,307
and our kingdom's
beloved bride-to-be.

393
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:52,376
Welcome to sovereign
jurisdiction, ambassador.

394
00:31:52,378 --> 00:31:54,344
We'll take care
of things from here.

395
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:57,080
Forgive me, captain drautos.
See her highness to the castle.

396
00:31:57,082 --> 00:32:00,284
I had no idea that you--
i wasn't made aware of any--

397
00:32:00,286 --> 00:32:02,519
- excuse me. Thank you.
- No, you-- I must--

398
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:05,122
I must-- no, I have to clear it
with my superiors first.

399
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:06,790
Your highness.

400
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:08,025
Uh...

401
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:21,204
Her royal highness,
Princess lunafreya of tenebrae.

402
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:32,282
It has been a long time,
your majesty.

403
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,718
Yes.

404
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,987
Far too long.

405
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:41,291
Prince noctis isn't here,
is he?

406
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:44,962
No, my dear. He is not.

407
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:50,968
I am too old to fight this war.

408
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:54,004
I have no choice
but to receive the empire

409
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:56,640
and accept their treaty.

410
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:58,942
Even so...

411
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:02,679
I had hoped to hold the wedding
elsewhere, somewhere safe.

412
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:06,216
I sent one of my glaive
to see you there, but--

413
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:11,254
it is not too late.

414
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:12,956
I can ready an escort.

415
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:16,193
Please, go to my son.

416
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:20,230
No.

417
00:33:20,232 --> 00:33:24,301
Wherever I go,
the empire will follow.

418
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:28,939
It would only place
the prince in greater danger.

419
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:31,174
It is my duty
to protect the prince

420
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:33,977
and see his destiny fulfilled.

421
00:33:33,979 --> 00:33:38,015
These 12 years
have not changed that.

422
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:40,984
And what of your destiny?

423
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:46,223
My duty is my destiny,
your majesty.

424
00:33:46,225 --> 00:33:50,494
I'm prepared to accept
whatever may come to pass.

425
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:01,204
So, what do you think?

426
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:04,541
All these lands
will be imperial soon.

427
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,309
Reckon things will get
better when them

428
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:08,045
niffs start
calling the shots?

429
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:09,913
Not one damn bit.

430
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:12,115
Don't matter
who's calling the shots.

431
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:14,251
Long as they're calling them
from behind the wall,

432
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:17,821
ain't nothing gonna
change around here.

433
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:19,189
Get over here.

434
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:20,824
All right.

435
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:26,596
That's a hand!

436
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:33,403
I trust the reunion
was a happy one?

437
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:36,073
Has she been a hostage
of niflheim all this time?

438
00:34:36,075 --> 00:34:38,108
She's a symbol of the peace.
That's all I'm told.

439
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,543
Doesn't sound like it.

440
00:34:39,545 --> 00:34:42,012
Sounds like she's here for
something bigger than that.

441
00:34:42,014 --> 00:34:43,547
Your orders
are to protect her.

442
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,551
Not to look, not to listen,
not to think.

443
00:34:47,553 --> 00:34:49,519
Understood?

444
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:51,621
Drautos.

445
00:34:51,623 --> 00:34:53,824
Yes, report.

446
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,430
Get the hell out of my way.

447
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,365
That's my friend you
got in there, damn it.

448
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:04,568
Sir, you can't go in until
the examination has ended.

449
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,770
What examination?
What the hell's going on?

450
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:10,207
Hey, take it easy, big guy.

451
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:11,875
These bastards
rushed Crowe in there

452
00:35:11,877 --> 00:35:13,543
the moment she got back.

453
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:16,246
And now they won't
let me in to see her.

454
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,550
Wait.

455
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:59,556
Crowe's personal effects.

456
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:03,160
Do with them as you see fit.

457
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:09,199
So, what kind of mission
did you really send her on?

458
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:13,436
No glaive winds up dead
on a standard escort.

459
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:16,273
I'll see the armistice
does not interfere

460
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:18,475
with a full investigation.

461
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:23,413
She was a good soldier.

462
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:26,349
Her death
will not go unanswered.

463
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,622
What a life, huh?

464
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:38,228
She was brought up
an orphan.

465
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,530
Run out of her village.

466
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:47,504
I still remember
the first time I saw her.

467
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:49,906
Scrawny little thing,

468
00:36:49,908 --> 00:36:52,209
all covered in dirt.

469
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:55,779
Not a friend in the world.

470
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:01,084
But those eyes...

471
00:37:01,086 --> 00:37:02,819
Damn.

472
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:06,223
There was something
about those eyes.

473
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:16,900
She deserved better.

474
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:19,769
And I would've done anything
to give it to--

475
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:37,420
libertus, wait.

476
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:41,691
Crowe died a glaive.

477
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:45,829
You can still honor her
by fighting as one.

478
00:37:45,831 --> 00:37:49,232
You're dumber than me
sometimes, you know that?

479
00:37:49,234 --> 00:37:51,468
Don't you get it?

480
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:54,704
Lucis killed Crowe.

481
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,412
Go back to the castle.

482
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:04,781
Tell the king there's
no peace to be had

483
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:08,318
from throwing the weak
to the wolves.

484
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,688
I'll fight my own fight
from here on out.

485
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:17,060
See you around, hero.

486
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:47,090
<i> A hairpin?</i>

487
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:49,159
<i> I didn't think you were</i>
<i> into that kind of thing.</i>

488
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:51,895
<i>- It's not for me.</i>
<i>- It's a gift for the Princess.</i>

489
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:34,637
A most grand reception,
king Regis.

490
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:36,773
You honor all of niflheim.

491
00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:40,877
Oh, the honor is ours,
emperor aldercapt.

492
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:44,514
You have ventured far to
grace us with your presence.

493
00:39:44,516 --> 00:39:49,119
It was the very least
i could do.

494
00:39:49,121 --> 00:39:53,723
Tomorrow will be an historic
day for both our nations.

495
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:57,994
And your insomnia
is truly a marvel.

496
00:39:57,996 --> 00:40:03,099
My own cities
pale in comparison.

497
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:07,771
I pray we are able to take
away much from this visit.

498
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:18,014
Hello.

499
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:22,252
I'm afraid we were never
properly introduced yesterday.

500
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:24,654
I'm afraid it's going
to have to wait, your highness.

501
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:26,122
I'm on guard duty.

502
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:29,192
Then surely there's no
safer place for me to be.

503
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,563
May I ask your name?

504
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:38,435
Uh, nyx. Nyx Ulric.

505
00:40:38,437 --> 00:40:42,906
There is something else
i wish to ask you, nyx Ulric.

506
00:40:42,908 --> 00:40:46,743
King Regis said he sent one
of your order to come find me.

507
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:51,448
I should like to offer
my thanks in person.

508
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:54,918
Where might I find
this brave soldier?

509
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:01,624
Oh.

510
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,626
Oh, I did not--

511
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:06,129
I am so sorry.
Don't be.

512
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:10,700
Here.

513
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:15,371
She was carrying this.

514
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:17,140
It was meant for you.

515
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:21,311
For me?

516
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:23,046
Keep it.

517
00:41:23,048 --> 00:41:25,582
She would've wanted you
to have it.

518
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:31,287
I will carry it
with me always.

519
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:33,056
Thank you.

520
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:05,522
Do you have any idea
what this peace means?

521
00:42:05,524 --> 00:42:08,224
It means our homes are gone.

522
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:09,859
All of them.

523
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,628
Forever.

524
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:18,301
Heard I could find
some treaty haters here.

525
00:42:18,303 --> 00:42:21,037
I come to the right place?

526
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,705
You certainly have.

527
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:25,708
Everyone say hello to a man
who spends his days

528
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,477
in the loyal service
of our good king.

529
00:42:27,479 --> 00:42:29,812
"Spent."

530
00:42:29,814 --> 00:42:31,981
Those days are over.

531
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:35,018
I'm done listening
to that bastard's lies.

532
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:38,187
He may sit on a throne,
but he ain't no king,

533
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:40,423
least not of mine.

534
00:42:40,425 --> 00:42:42,859
Well, then.

535
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:45,962
Welcome to
the resistance, brother.

536
00:42:45,964 --> 00:42:48,498
I hope you're here to talk.

537
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,567
What do you wanna know?

538
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:04,414
Please, wherever noctis is,
keep him safe.

539
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:06,149
That's all I ask.

540
00:43:06,151 --> 00:43:08,785
To what god do you pray?

541
00:43:08,787 --> 00:43:12,855
You, the slave of fate
and destiny.

542
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:16,526
Abandon your prayers.

543
00:43:16,528 --> 00:43:18,428
The gods do not listen.

544
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:21,364
General glauca.
Why are you here?

545
00:43:21,366 --> 00:43:26,002
You are far too clever to have
ever believed in this peace.

546
00:43:26,004 --> 00:43:28,638
Pity you couldn't see
your beloved noctis.

547
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,839
You have another purpose.

548
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:32,742
I'm not here for niflheim.
No.

549
00:43:32,744 --> 00:43:34,377
You are here for me.

550
00:43:34,379 --> 00:43:35,645
You?

551
00:43:35,647 --> 00:43:37,280
I do not understand.

552
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:40,850
Come tomorrow, you will.

553
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:30,166
<i> Niflheim contingent</i>
<i> has left the hotel.</i>

554
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:32,702
<i> Less than three hours</i>
<i> until the ceremony.</i>

555
00:44:32,704 --> 00:44:34,704
<i> Bolster the citadel guard.</i>

556
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:43,546
<i>Nyx, is the Princess with you?</i>

557
00:44:43,548 --> 00:44:46,182
No. I'm on duty at the citadel.

558
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:48,818
<i> Well, the niffs just left</i>
<i> for the ceremony.</i>

559
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,054
<i> And she wasn't with them.</i>

560
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:13,943
<i> A homing beacon?</i>

561
00:45:13,945 --> 00:45:15,611
Yeah,
I'll send the coordinates now.

562
00:45:15,613 --> 00:45:17,146
Can you pinpoint
a location for me?

563
00:45:17,148 --> 00:45:19,315
<i> Sure, but it sounds like</i>
<i> a wild-goose chase.</i>

564
00:45:19,317 --> 00:45:21,551
<i> Guess you got some</i>
<i> free time on your hands, huh?</i>

565
00:45:21,553 --> 00:45:24,787
Guess I do, for better or worse.

566
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:50,513
<i> Those coordinates are about</i>
<i> 20 miles south of insomnia.</i>

567
00:45:50,515 --> 00:45:52,281
Outside the wall.

568
00:45:52,283 --> 00:45:55,418
<i> What the hell was Crowe doing</i>
<i> all the way out there?</i>

569
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,754
No, no. They sent her to--

570
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,691
I need another favor, pelna.

571
00:46:01,693 --> 00:46:03,226
Pull those coordinates
up on the radar

572
00:46:03,228 --> 00:46:04,961
and let me know what you find.
<i> On it. </i>

573
00:46:04,963 --> 00:46:07,029
<i> You're thinking this is</i>
<i> all a big deal now, huh?</i>

574
00:46:07,031 --> 00:46:10,867
Yeah, too big to ignore.

575
00:46:10,869 --> 00:46:12,902
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

576
00:46:12,904 --> 00:46:14,670
Hey, hey, hey.
Whoa, wait a minute.

577
00:46:14,672 --> 00:46:16,272
Stop right there.

578
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:23,279
Listen up.
This is not the gate watch.

579
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:27,383
This is the heart of our city,
the home of our king.

580
00:46:27,385 --> 00:46:30,253
The ceremony
must not be disturbed.

581
00:46:30,255 --> 00:46:33,856
Neutralize any threat
quickly and quietly.

582
00:46:33,858 --> 00:46:35,725
Is that understood?

583
00:46:35,727 --> 00:46:37,894
Yes, sir.

584
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:27,810
Glaive to command.
Are you there, captain? Urgent.

585
00:47:27,812 --> 00:47:29,912
Damn it, drautos.

586
00:47:29,914 --> 00:47:31,480
<i> Jackpot, nyx.</i>
<i> There's a whole fleet</i>

587
00:47:31,482 --> 00:47:33,082
<i> of airships</i>
<i> sitting at that spot.</i>

588
00:47:33,084 --> 00:47:35,785
Niflheim.
<i> Yup, and from the looks of it</i>

589
00:47:35,787 --> 00:47:37,220
<i>I'd say they're headed to war.</i>

590
00:47:37,222 --> 00:47:39,255
Where's the captain?
<i> Should be at the citadel.</i>

591
00:47:39,257 --> 00:47:40,690
There's no answer
on his frequency.

592
00:47:40,692 --> 00:47:42,491
<i> I don't know,</i>
<i> must have his hands full</i>

593
00:47:42,493 --> 00:47:45,161
<i> with the escort detail. </i>
Pelna, one last favor.

594
00:47:45,163 --> 00:47:46,929
I need you to prep
the glaive for action.

595
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:48,464
<i> What are you talking about?</i>

596
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:50,666
<i> You wanna deploy</i>
<i> without the captain's order?</i>

597
00:47:50,668 --> 00:47:51,934
Trust me. Just get it done.

598
00:47:51,936 --> 00:47:53,569
<i> Wait,</i>
<i> what am I supposed to tell--?</i>

599
00:47:53,571 --> 00:47:55,872
Stand down, glaive.

600
00:48:00,143 --> 00:48:02,645
The ceremony is in
less than two hours.

601
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:04,547
We must make ready.

602
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:08,951
Very well.

603
00:48:08,953 --> 00:48:10,253
Your majesty.

604
00:48:10,255 --> 00:48:12,455
A man of the kingsglaive
is here, sire.

605
00:48:12,457 --> 00:48:13,923
He demands an audience.

606
00:48:13,925 --> 00:48:15,658
"Demands"?

607
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,193
- Your majesty, please.
- Halt.

608
00:48:17,195 --> 00:48:19,462
Give the order
to deploy the glaive.

609
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:23,499
You.

610
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:25,167
A niflheim fleet
makes ready for war

611
00:48:25,169 --> 00:48:26,636
20 miles to the south.

612
00:48:26,638 --> 00:48:28,604
An imperial fleet.

613
00:48:28,606 --> 00:48:30,239
And they have the Princess.

614
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:35,044
Clarus, post guards
outside the treaty room.

615
00:48:35,046 --> 00:48:37,413
It will be seen as a lack
of faith in the peace.

616
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:38,948
Which we all harbor.

617
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:41,250
See it done.

618
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:43,920
We may well have to take
emperor aldercapt into custody.

619
00:48:43,922 --> 00:48:45,588
Detain him?

620
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:48,124
That would go beyond
a new declaration of war.

621
00:48:48,126 --> 00:48:51,794
We are still at war, clarus.

622
00:48:51,796 --> 00:48:55,197
And you, nyx Ulric.

623
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:58,901
How soon can
the kingsglaive deploy?

624
00:48:58,903 --> 00:49:01,504
On your word, at once.

625
00:49:01,506 --> 00:49:03,673
Go, then.

626
00:49:03,675 --> 00:49:05,441
Save Luna.

627
00:49:10,248 --> 00:49:12,381
What if this is a diversion?

628
00:49:12,383 --> 00:49:13,716
Not likely.

629
00:49:13,718 --> 00:49:16,218
Tenebrae's Princess is onboard.

630
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:23,993
We've got two jobs.

631
00:49:23,995 --> 00:49:26,329
Save her.

632
00:49:26,331 --> 00:49:29,265
And stop those niff ships
from flying on insomnia.

633
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:38,341
We go in teams.

634
00:49:38,343 --> 00:49:41,978
Standard infiltrate and extract.

635
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,513
Nyx, you command.
We'll follow.

636
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:51,020
The glaive stands together,
captain or no.

637
00:49:51,022 --> 00:49:52,221
For hearth.

638
00:49:52,223 --> 00:49:54,457
And home!

639
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:08,137
<i> We are less</i>
<i> than 20 minutes away</i>

640
00:50:08,139 --> 00:50:11,107
<i> from the signing of this</i>
<i> historic treaty.</i>

641
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:22,018
<i> I received word</i>
<i> of the king's order to deploy.</i>

642
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,420
<i> I'll see to matters</i>
<i> in the city.</i>

643
00:50:24,422 --> 00:50:27,757
<i> You have your mission,</i>
<i> and it won't be easy.</i>

644
00:50:27,759 --> 00:50:29,392
<i> The objective is two-fold.</i>

645
00:50:29,394 --> 00:50:31,794
<i> Secure the hostage,</i>
<i> and stay the enemy advance.</i>

646
00:50:31,796 --> 00:50:33,796
<i> Just be careful.</i>

647
00:50:33,798 --> 00:50:36,432
<i> One glaive already died</i>
<i> for this Princess.</i>

648
00:50:36,434 --> 00:50:39,268
<i> Niflheim won't</i>
<i> give her up easily.</i>

649
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:54,316
<i> Team two.</i>

650
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:14,203
<i> Oh, man.</i>

651
00:51:14,205 --> 00:51:16,105
<i> Hurry up, nyx!</i>

652
00:51:22,946 --> 00:51:25,347
<i> Help!</i>

653
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:39,762
Over here.

654
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,499
Preparing to head below deck.

655
00:51:43,501 --> 00:51:46,368
<i> Do not engage the enemy</i>
<i> until instructed.</i>

656
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:47,870
<i> The ceremony is underway.</i>

657
00:51:47,872 --> 00:51:51,173
<i> Let's wait and see</i>
<i> how niflheim plays this.</i>

658
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:58,247
The kingsglaive have
infiltrated the ships.

659
00:51:58,249 --> 00:52:00,749
So everything's going
according to plan.

660
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:29,712
Ulric reporting.

661
00:52:29,714 --> 00:52:34,216
Six niflheim airships confirmed
inbound for insomnia.

662
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:42,658
Nyx, this doesn't feel
like a war fleet.

663
00:53:06,484 --> 00:53:07,983
I think I might've found her.

664
00:53:07,985 --> 00:53:09,585
I got a guarded door here.

665
00:53:09,587 --> 00:53:12,788
<i>Two niff mts. What's the plan?</i>

666
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:17,359
Hold position.

667
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:18,894
Arrived at destination.

668
00:53:18,896 --> 00:53:21,497
High possibility of target
in the vicinity.

669
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,302
<i> Proceed to secure.</i>

670
00:53:26,304 --> 00:53:27,736
It's going to mean a fight.

671
00:53:27,738 --> 00:53:30,539
<i> Keep it quiet</i>
<i> and keep it confined.</i>

672
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:33,976
Pelna, you're clear to engage.
But keep it quiet.

673
00:53:33,978 --> 00:53:36,278
I'm on my way.

674
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:43,052
Forgive my delay.

675
00:53:43,054 --> 00:53:45,421
A bit of unforeseen trouble.

676
00:53:45,423 --> 00:53:48,591
Nothing too vexing,
i hope.

677
00:53:48,593 --> 00:53:50,626
A simple theft,
nothing more.

678
00:53:50,628 --> 00:53:53,796
A daring thief,
to steal from the king.

679
00:53:53,798 --> 00:53:58,200
Perhaps magical walls
and castle gates

680
00:53:58,202 --> 00:54:00,569
do not keep all things safe.

681
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:02,371
Perhaps.

682
00:54:02,373 --> 00:54:03,739
But no matter.

683
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:06,575
That which was taken
will soon be returned.

684
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:08,444
Impressive.

685
00:54:08,446 --> 00:54:12,748
You are a paragon
of kingly composure.

686
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,518
But I must ask,

687
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,722
how can you be so sure?

688
00:54:19,724 --> 00:54:22,691
Because this thing
is no mere trinket.

689
00:54:22,693 --> 00:54:25,861
It possesses a will
all its own.

690
00:54:25,863 --> 00:54:28,831
Enough to break
any thief's grasp.

691
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:31,166
Hm.

692
00:54:31,168 --> 00:54:36,772
That sounds
a very fine prize indeed.

693
00:54:44,749 --> 00:54:47,516
Not now, damn it.

694
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:51,420
For me?
Aw, you shouldn't have.

695
00:54:54,357 --> 00:54:58,294
Target confirmed.
She's unharmed.

696
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:06,001
The glaives have recovered
the Princess, your majesty.

697
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:12,141
<i> Have you found your thief?</i>

698
00:55:12,143 --> 00:55:13,575
We have.

699
00:55:13,577 --> 00:55:16,378
And what was stolen
remains intact.

700
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:18,047
Joyous news.

701
00:55:18,049 --> 00:55:20,783
I am relieved to hear it.

702
00:55:20,785 --> 00:55:24,653
Tell me,
how heavy a sentence

703
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:28,023
does the crime of theft
carry in your empire?

704
00:55:28,025 --> 00:55:29,425
Among the heaviest.

705
00:55:29,427 --> 00:55:33,762
Although there is
one exception.

706
00:55:33,764 --> 00:55:37,399
Things are about to get ugly
over here.

707
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:41,403
Pelna, get out of there.
It's a trap.

708
00:55:41,405 --> 00:55:44,540
What is that?
A curious old law

709
00:55:44,542 --> 00:55:47,376
I still permit in the outlands.

710
00:55:47,378 --> 00:55:50,212
A thief who escapes his captor

711
00:55:50,214 --> 00:55:53,415
can no longer be held
to account for his crime.

712
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:56,719
A warning to the victim.

713
00:55:56,721 --> 00:56:01,256
Never show weakness, lest you
forgo the hand of justice.

714
00:56:01,258 --> 00:56:03,959
Oh, no, good king.

715
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:06,862
Far from it.

716
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:08,931
<i>The treaty is now on the table.</i>

717
00:56:08,933 --> 00:56:11,533
<i> The countdown begins</i>
<i> to this historical moment.</i>

718
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:15,771
<i> It is a warning</i>
<i> to the hand of justice itself</i>

719
00:56:15,773 --> 00:56:19,942
never to loose
its grip.

720
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:34,523
Unit one,
secure the perimeter.

721
00:56:34,525 --> 00:56:36,725
Unit two,
stand your ground.

722
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:39,261
Pelna!

723
00:56:39,263 --> 00:56:43,365
One tenebrae Princess,
safe and--

724
00:56:46,003 --> 00:56:47,436
come on.

725
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:14,897
The crystal.
They're after the crystal.

726
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:22,471
There's something
going on below deck.

727
00:57:22,473 --> 00:57:25,607
The ship's not going
to make it to insom--

728
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,582
you...

729
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:37,052
What's going on?

730
00:57:37,054 --> 00:57:39,321
<i> Insomnia is under attack.</i>

731
00:57:39,323 --> 00:57:41,557
Who brought you here?

732
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:43,792
General glauca.
You were bait.

733
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:46,829
Us coming here was
all part of their plan.

734
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:16,825
Target secured.
Request permission to withdraw.

735
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:21,597
<i> Granted. Get to--</i>

736
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:48,457
the crystal will not serve you.

737
00:58:48,459 --> 00:58:50,559
Nor you...

738
00:58:50,561 --> 00:58:54,463
Once I take it
from this accursed city.

739
00:58:54,465 --> 00:58:57,366
It's not the crystal
I'm here for.

740
00:58:57,368 --> 00:58:59,935
The wall. It's gone.

741
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:05,073
Fall back. It's a trap.

742
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:14,283
What the hell is going on?

743
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:26,762
Traitors.

744
00:59:26,764 --> 00:59:29,631
What's got into you?

745
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:18,300
Come, we must escape
while we can.

746
01:02:18,302 --> 01:02:21,036
No, clarus.

747
01:02:21,038 --> 01:02:23,972
I fear escape
is no longer an option.

748
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:34,182
General glauca.

749
01:02:38,287 --> 01:02:40,956
Can you make it up?
Can you stand?

750
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:03,745
Luche!

751
01:03:10,686 --> 01:03:12,854
What are you doing?

752
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:22,964
You gotta be kidding me.

753
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:30,972
They teach piloting
back at the royal academy?

754
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:33,842
Give me that.

755
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,515
It's been a long time since i
fought at your side, old friend.

756
01:03:40,517 --> 01:03:42,017
Yes,

757
01:03:42,019 --> 01:03:44,953
but this time it
is not your fight.

758
01:03:44,955 --> 01:03:46,855
If you wish to leave, go now.

759
01:03:46,857 --> 01:03:50,192
And abandon my king?
I think not.

760
01:03:50,194 --> 01:03:54,396
Besides,
our magic is bound to you.

761
01:03:54,398 --> 01:03:56,832
If you fall, lucis falls.

762
01:03:56,834 --> 01:03:59,835
Then let us once
more into the fray,

763
01:03:59,837 --> 01:04:01,903
old friend.

764
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:30,432
You must take me back
to king Regis.

765
01:04:30,434 --> 01:04:33,368
Are you out of your mind?
Insomnia's a war zone.

766
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:36,338
I have a duty.
I cannot neglect it.

767
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:39,908
Yeah, I heard all that before.
Then you know we must hurry.

768
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:41,810
Hurry to do what?
Get yourself killed?

769
01:04:41,812 --> 01:04:43,078
I do not fear death.

770
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:46,548
Enough with all this
brave Princess act.

771
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:52,587
Just pray this thing
will make the trip.

772
01:05:17,314 --> 01:05:18,980
Clarus!

773
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:27,155
Well, I daresay everything has
proceeded according to plan.

774
01:05:27,157 --> 01:05:29,224
No?
So it has.

775
01:05:29,226 --> 01:05:31,092
We have broken
the wall.

776
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:34,062
All that remains
is to break the city.

777
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:38,066
Shall we take our leave,
then?

778
01:05:38,068 --> 01:05:40,268
The sun will soon set.

779
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:45,040
We need not be here to witness
the terrors of the night.

780
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:58,353
The crystal.

781
01:06:01,857 --> 01:06:04,626
You're going too fast.
We have to land.

782
01:06:04,628 --> 01:06:07,062
Yeah, you're gonna have
to give me a minute on that.

783
01:06:07,064 --> 01:06:08,763
There is no time.
I will go on my own.

784
01:06:08,765 --> 01:06:13,301
You got wings underneath
that dress? You can't use magic.

785
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:15,470
Not all miracles
are made by magic.

786
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:17,205
I do not fear death.

787
01:06:17,207 --> 01:06:20,508
What I fear is doing nothing
and losing everything.

788
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:24,980
Oh, come on.

789
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:34,622
You can thank magic for
that miracle, your highness.

790
01:06:54,710 --> 01:06:56,378
The reckoning is at hand.

791
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:02,017
Dawn of a new age.

792
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:10,058
You have the crystal. What
more would you take from me?

793
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:26,441
The ring of the lucii.

794
01:07:26,443 --> 01:07:29,444
<i> I lost my mother, my country,</i>
<i> my birthright.</i>

795
01:07:29,446 --> 01:07:32,547
Niflheim was the only
life left to me.

796
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:35,583
But all of that
was for this.

797
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:39,354
The ring belongs
to me now.

798
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:50,999
Hear me, Lucian kings of old,

799
01:07:51,001 --> 01:07:53,468
for I am ravus nox fleuret

800
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:57,705
and none is more worthy
of your power than I.

801
01:07:57,707 --> 01:08:01,109
No. Why?

802
01:08:01,111 --> 01:08:03,545
Why do you refuse me?

803
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,967
Look out!

804
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:53,394
Quickly, through here.

805
01:09:12,381 --> 01:09:15,250
This leads to a hidden
passageway.

806
01:09:15,252 --> 01:09:16,551
Follow it.

807
01:09:16,553 --> 01:09:18,486
Once you are away,
make for altissia.

808
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:20,021
Noctis
awaits you there.

809
01:09:20,023 --> 01:09:21,589
Your majesty.

810
01:09:21,591 --> 01:09:23,491
You knew this was coming--
yes.

811
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:27,529
But it was the only way
to draw their wrath from noctis.

812
01:09:27,531 --> 01:09:30,098
Is that the way of our king?

813
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:33,401
Sacrifice Lucian
sons to save his own?

814
01:09:33,403 --> 01:09:35,436
To save the world.

815
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:39,674
See Luna safely
to altissia.

816
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:43,444
This is not an order
from a king to his glaive.

817
01:09:43,446 --> 01:09:46,047
This is a plea
from one man to another.

818
01:09:46,049 --> 01:09:48,883
Please, nyx Ulric,
keep her safe.

819
01:09:48,885 --> 01:09:50,818
For the future of all.

820
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:53,588
The future?

821
01:09:55,659 --> 01:09:57,592
Here.

822
01:09:57,594 --> 01:09:58,693
Take this.

823
01:09:58,695 --> 01:10:02,597
It is time it passed
to another's keeping.

824
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:37,198
No, please. Stop.

825
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:40,635
Get back!
Please. Don't leave us.

826
01:10:40,637 --> 01:10:44,272
I know your mother
would wish the same as me.

827
01:10:44,274 --> 01:10:48,009
That you and noctis
live happily.

828
01:10:48,011 --> 01:10:51,379
All those years captive
because I failed you.

829
01:10:51,381 --> 01:10:53,381
Not again.

830
01:10:53,383 --> 01:10:55,583
Locked doors
will seal your fate no longer.

831
01:10:55,585 --> 01:10:59,053
King Regis...

832
01:10:59,055 --> 01:11:02,757
Our hope goes with you now,
nyx Ulric. Godspeed.

833
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,396
Behold the king of lucis,

834
01:11:41,398 --> 01:11:44,365
who hoarded tranquility
within his precious walls.

835
01:11:44,367 --> 01:11:48,936
Where is your
tranquility now, king?

836
01:11:48,938 --> 01:11:53,641
Here is your peace,
by steel's swift descent.

837
01:12:09,191 --> 01:12:11,392
Go.

838
01:12:30,612 --> 01:12:34,415
No. We must get away
from here.

839
01:12:34,417 --> 01:12:37,752
It is what your king wanted.

840
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:20,094
<i> Lady lunafreya has escaped</i>
<i> with the ring.</i>

841
01:13:20,096 --> 01:13:21,629
<i> Find her at once.</i>

842
01:13:21,631 --> 01:13:23,531
<i> She is not to leave the city.</i>

843
01:13:25,467 --> 01:13:27,001
Ulric to command.
Come in, captain.

844
01:13:27,003 --> 01:13:28,870
<i> Footage of the perpetrators</i>

845
01:13:28,872 --> 01:13:31,005
<i> was captured by a nearby</i>
<i> surveillance camera.</i>

846
01:13:31,007 --> 01:13:33,274
<i> Here are images</i>
<i> of the six suspects.</i>

847
01:13:33,276 --> 01:13:35,476
<i> One has been identified</i>
<i> as galahdian refugee,</i>

848
01:13:35,478 --> 01:13:36,944
<i> libertus ostium,</i>

849
01:13:36,946 --> 01:13:40,214
<i> a former member</i>
<i> of the Lucian kingsglaive.</i>

850
01:13:41,618 --> 01:13:44,085
Hey, come here.
Come here.

851
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:46,421
I got you, I got you.
You're all right.

852
01:13:46,423 --> 01:13:48,956
You're okay.

853
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,425
It's fine.

854
01:13:50,427 --> 01:13:51,993
We're free.

855
01:13:51,995 --> 01:13:53,728
We're free now.

856
01:13:53,730 --> 01:13:55,830
We're free?
What do you mean, "we're free"?

857
01:13:55,832 --> 01:13:58,666
The empire. They promised.

858
01:13:58,668 --> 01:14:01,502
This district's ours.

859
01:14:01,504 --> 01:14:03,404
All the refugees.

860
01:14:03,406 --> 01:14:05,773
It's our new home.

861
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:07,942
The empire?
You went in with niflheim?

862
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:09,844
Here.

863
01:14:09,846 --> 01:14:12,647
Take this.
Meet up with the others.

864
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:17,685
You're the hero
of our revolution, brother.

865
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:24,725
Damn it!

866
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:35,303
This guy just doesn't
know when he's beat.

867
01:14:35,305 --> 01:14:38,673
Can you drive?
I can try.

868
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:43,644
I'll be right back.

869
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:57,124
No warping for you this time,
hero.

870
01:15:01,363 --> 01:15:03,965
Give me the wheel. Go.

871
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:07,869
You are without your magic.

872
01:15:07,871 --> 01:15:11,539
You noticed that, huh?
It must have died with the king.

873
01:15:11,541 --> 01:15:14,208
<i> You're making a mess</i>
<i> of my city, glaive.</i>

874
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:16,677
<i> I thought I told you</i>
<i> not to go playing hero.</i>

875
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:17,979
<i> Leave the ship to me.</i>

876
01:15:17,981 --> 01:15:21,048
Looks like you got
a royal fare to see to.

877
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:12,133
Move it.

878
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:39,894
Maybe not all miracles
are made by magic.

879
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:50,905
Oh, great.

880
01:17:08,256 --> 01:17:10,658
The hell did you do
to piss these things off?

881
01:17:10,660 --> 01:17:13,628
It's not me they're after.
It's the ring.

882
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:15,129
What's so special
about this ring?

883
01:17:15,131 --> 01:17:17,064
Don't tell me
the future's riding on it.

884
01:17:17,066 --> 01:17:19,000
He who wears the ring
communes with the lucii

885
01:17:19,002 --> 01:17:20,201
and commands great power.

886
01:17:20,203 --> 01:17:22,503
What kind of power?
A forbidden one.

887
01:17:22,505 --> 01:17:24,538
Sealed within
the ring, long ago.

888
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:29,677
The old wall. I thought that
was just a bedtime story.

889
01:17:37,386 --> 01:17:39,020
I can assure you it is not.

890
01:17:39,022 --> 01:17:42,123
But the lucii Grant their power
only to those they deem worthy.

891
01:17:42,125 --> 01:17:44,558
So that guy who tried
it on back there,

892
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,761
I guess he wasn't deemed worthy.

893
01:17:47,796 --> 01:17:49,430
That was my brother.

894
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:54,268
These 12 years
have changed ravus.

895
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:57,538
He is bound by the past,
and lost in his lust for power.

896
01:17:59,475 --> 01:18:01,108
How the hell did they find us?

897
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:22,997
Your hairpin. They're
tracking it. Give it to me.

898
01:18:30,672 --> 01:18:32,707
I had a little sister once.

899
01:18:32,709 --> 01:18:35,242
She was killed
when the empire came.

900
01:18:36,778 --> 01:18:39,313
I couldn't save her.

901
01:18:39,315 --> 01:18:42,717
I was as helpless then
as I am now.

902
01:18:44,886 --> 01:18:47,888
I couldn't show her
the future she wanted.

903
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:53,994
True power is not something that
is found by those who seek it.

904
01:18:53,996 --> 01:18:57,865
It is something that comes
to those who deserve it.

905
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:02,903
Your sister wanted you
to see a future as well.

906
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:09,410
Anyone would wish the same
for family they love.

907
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:15,449
You don't pull any punches,
do you?

908
01:19:23,258 --> 01:19:24,992
I'm over here.

909
01:19:24,994 --> 01:19:27,394
<i> Do you hear me?</i>
<i> Repeat, this is drautos.</i>

910
01:19:27,396 --> 01:19:28,829
<i> Can you hear me? Over.</i>

911
01:19:28,831 --> 01:19:31,132
Your timing's impeccable,
captain.

912
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:38,139
If the lucii are real,

913
01:19:38,141 --> 01:19:41,342
they sure don't seem to mind
their city getting torn apart.

914
01:19:47,015 --> 01:19:49,450
<i> You're to rendezvous</i>
<i> and regroup. Understood?</i>

915
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:54,421
That might not be so easy,
captain.

916
01:19:54,423 --> 01:19:56,891
My wings have been clipped,
in case you didn't know.

917
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:31,091
<i> Ulric. Are you all right?</i>

918
01:20:32,295 --> 01:20:34,395
I'm not dead, if that's
what you mean, sir.

919
01:20:34,397 --> 01:20:37,364
<i> Head for section d</i>
<i> as soon as you can.</i>

920
01:20:37,366 --> 01:20:40,201
<i> I'll have</i>
<i> an evacuation team ready.</i>

921
01:20:40,203 --> 01:20:42,736
Don't suppose you could
meet me at the gate.

922
01:20:42,738 --> 01:20:46,240
I'd kind of like to
get the hell out of this city.

923
01:20:46,242 --> 01:20:48,576
<i> Imperials hold all exits.</i>
<i> There's no way through.</i>

924
01:20:48,578 --> 01:20:49,944
<i> I'll meet you at section d.</i>

925
01:20:49,946 --> 01:20:51,779
<i> Cut all radio contact</i>
<i> until then.</i>

926
01:20:51,781 --> 01:20:53,848
<i> And make sure you get there.</i>

927
01:20:53,850 --> 01:20:55,282
It's a date, sir.

928
01:21:11,266 --> 01:21:14,201
Ain't no turning back now.

929
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:15,569
<i> Status report.</i>

930
01:21:15,571 --> 01:21:17,705
<i> Ulric killed some good men.</i>

931
01:21:17,707 --> 01:21:21,342
<i> What about the ring? </i>
Man 2:<i> We don't have it yet.</i>

932
01:21:21,344 --> 01:21:23,911
<i> This is glauca.</i>
<i> King Regis is dead.</i>

933
01:21:23,913 --> 01:21:26,480
<i> The ring is on</i>
<i> its way to section d.</i>

934
01:21:26,482 --> 01:21:29,250
<i> We must recover the ring</i>
<i> to realize our goal.</i>

935
01:21:29,252 --> 01:21:32,253
<i> If Ulric or the Princess</i>
<i> get in the way, take them out.</i>

936
01:21:32,255 --> 01:21:34,755
<i> Reclaim our hearth and home.</i>

937
01:21:34,757 --> 01:21:36,857
"Hearth and home?"

938
01:21:36,859 --> 01:21:38,425
<i> Libertus, come in.</i>

939
01:21:38,427 --> 01:21:39,994
<i> Where are you?</i>
<i> Are you all right?</i>

940
01:21:39,996 --> 01:21:41,629
I'm fine.

941
01:21:41,631 --> 01:21:44,198
On the way back to base now.

942
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,200
<i> We need you to head to</i>
<i> the junction in section d.</i>

943
01:21:46,202 --> 01:21:48,369
<i> We're gonna join up</i>
<i> with another unit</i>

944
01:21:48,371 --> 01:21:50,204
<i> and make a clean sweep</i>
<i> of the place.</i>

945
01:21:50,206 --> 01:21:53,040
<i> We're one step away</i>
<i>from realizing this revolution.</i>

946
01:21:53,042 --> 01:21:55,342
<i> Let's not let pruvia's</i>
<i> death be in vain.</i>

947
01:21:55,344 --> 01:21:57,745
<i> We'll be waiting for you,</i>
<i> hero.</i>

948
01:22:24,372 --> 01:22:26,807
Don't move until I say
it's safe, all right?

949
01:22:26,809 --> 01:22:28,943
I won't.

950
01:22:35,817 --> 01:22:38,085
Ulric, reporting.

951
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:41,121
I have the Princess.

952
01:22:41,123 --> 01:22:42,589
She's alive and well.

953
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:52,733
No!
Get out of here.

954
01:22:55,503 --> 01:22:58,505
You've got some fight in you,
nyx, I'll give you that.

955
01:23:00,342 --> 01:23:02,009
Run. Now!

956
01:23:02,011 --> 01:23:03,477
Aah!

957
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:05,346
I can't believe
you're still moving

958
01:23:05,348 --> 01:23:07,781
with that hollow-point
in you.

959
01:23:07,783 --> 01:23:12,052
All Crowe could do was scream,
when one tore her insides apart.

960
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:14,455
Why'd you do it?

961
01:23:14,457 --> 01:23:16,957
Because the kingsglaive
is nothing.

962
01:23:16,959 --> 01:23:18,759
An old man's battle fodder

963
01:23:18,761 --> 01:23:20,494
sent to die
in insomnia's war

964
01:23:20,496 --> 01:23:23,263
while our homes
are bound and shackled.

965
01:23:23,265 --> 01:23:26,166
Niflheim took your home.

966
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:29,470
Took all our homes!

967
01:23:29,472 --> 01:23:32,439
Nothing will
ever change that.

968
01:23:32,441 --> 01:23:34,775
You never were
too smart.

969
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:39,580
You could've had
a new future with the empire.

970
01:23:56,064 --> 01:23:59,133
There's nowhere to run,
Princess.

971
01:23:59,135 --> 01:24:00,701
The ring.

972
01:24:02,637 --> 01:24:04,638
Give it to me.

973
01:24:27,128 --> 01:24:30,664
So many dead
over so simple a thing.

974
01:24:30,666 --> 01:24:33,967
But why? For what?

975
01:24:33,969 --> 01:24:35,903
Power.

976
01:24:35,905 --> 01:24:39,173
Untold power, beyond
the control of someone like you.

977
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:42,576
Power...

978
01:25:22,083 --> 01:25:24,651
Captain.

979
01:25:36,931 --> 01:25:39,199
Nyx!

980
01:25:41,069 --> 01:25:45,973
It's over.
The daemons are unleashed.

981
01:25:45,975 --> 01:25:48,809
Lucis is fallen.

982
01:25:50,712 --> 01:25:52,212
Surrender the ring.

983
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:58,919
Plan on giving those kings
a piece of your mind, Princess?

984
01:26:00,321 --> 01:26:03,590
You got a destiny to take
care of here, remember?

985
01:26:03,592 --> 01:26:07,361
Besides, didn't
anyone tell you?

986
01:26:09,497 --> 01:26:11,698
I'm the hero around here.

987
01:26:28,283 --> 01:26:33,720
Show yourselves, kings of lucis.

988
01:26:37,859 --> 01:26:41,395
You call upon the wards
of this world's future, mortal.

989
01:26:41,397 --> 01:26:43,463
And if you come
lusting for our power,

990
01:26:43,465 --> 01:26:46,366
you must first stand
in our judgment.

991
01:26:46,368 --> 01:26:51,572
How long will you do nothing
whilst insomnia burns?

992
01:26:51,574 --> 01:26:54,241
Old or new,
or whatever it is.

993
01:26:54,243 --> 01:26:57,778
Summon your wall.

994
01:26:57,780 --> 01:26:59,613
You do not command us.

995
01:26:59,615 --> 01:27:02,883
Yours is not even royal blood.

996
01:27:02,885 --> 01:27:06,253
It does not fall to us
to guard your city.

997
01:27:06,255 --> 01:27:07,888
Man is a fool creature,

998
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:11,158
clinging to his past
and cowering from his future.

999
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:15,128
Wasting his strength
on bygone days.

1000
01:27:15,130 --> 01:27:18,031
And what future
are you wards of?

1001
01:27:18,033 --> 01:27:19,499
So shortsighted.

1002
01:27:19,501 --> 01:27:21,935
And cursed never
to rise above it.

1003
01:27:21,937 --> 01:27:26,707
Wait. I have seen what this
brave soul is prepared to do.

1004
01:27:26,709 --> 01:27:29,843
He, too, seeks
to safeguard the future.

1005
01:27:29,845 --> 01:27:31,845
Your majesty.

1006
01:27:31,847 --> 01:27:35,716
Very well, young king. We will
weigh your warrior's worth.

1007
01:27:35,718 --> 01:27:38,485
But our boon
does not come cheap.

1008
01:27:38,487 --> 01:27:41,321
The cost is a life.

1009
01:27:41,323 --> 01:27:44,992
His or hers.

1010
01:27:44,994 --> 01:27:46,760
No.

1011
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:50,530
To hell with your power.

1012
01:27:51,432 --> 01:27:54,835
I'm not here for it.

1013
01:27:54,837 --> 01:27:59,506
I only came to tell you,
you are no kings, heh.

1014
01:27:59,508 --> 01:28:03,010
Your worth has been weighed
and found wanting.

1015
01:28:03,012 --> 01:28:04,911
Now burn.

1016
01:28:10,785 --> 01:28:13,787
You're going to lose
your precious ring.

1017
01:28:16,424 --> 01:28:19,860
But it's not too late
to save it.

1018
01:28:19,862 --> 01:28:22,195
You mean to barter
for your life?

1019
01:28:22,197 --> 01:28:24,498
No, no.

1020
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:27,567
My life is nothing.

1021
01:28:29,671 --> 01:28:33,473
Giving a future
to those who want to see it...

1022
01:28:35,009 --> 01:28:36,943
Is everything.

1023
01:28:36,945 --> 01:28:38,545
Hmm.

1024
01:28:38,547 --> 01:28:41,782
You do not fear, even
if that future is doomed.

1025
01:28:41,784 --> 01:28:46,486
If that sentiment is not false,
perhaps you are worthy.

1026
01:28:46,488 --> 01:28:49,423
We will Grant you our light.

1027
01:28:49,425 --> 01:28:52,526
But know it will set
when the sun rises.

1028
01:28:52,528 --> 01:28:56,463
And the price for it
will be your life.

1029
01:28:58,399 --> 01:29:01,635
You guys drive a hard bargain.

1030
01:29:03,271 --> 01:29:06,606
<i> Where do I sign?</i>

1031
01:29:15,983 --> 01:29:18,452
I could get used to this.

1032
01:29:23,892 --> 01:29:26,026
Nyx...

1033
01:29:26,028 --> 01:29:29,029
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

1034
01:29:29,031 --> 01:29:31,231
You saved me.

1035
01:29:31,233 --> 01:29:32,699
Now I owe you.

1036
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:35,402
For a change.
Hm.

1037
01:29:35,404 --> 01:29:37,003
I'm gonna need
another favor.

1038
01:29:37,005 --> 01:29:41,408
Meet lunafreya nox fleuret, our
prince's beloved bride-to-be.

1039
01:29:41,410 --> 01:29:44,511
She has the future
of the world in her hands.

1040
01:29:44,513 --> 01:29:48,615
Keep her safe,
get her out of insomnia.

1041
01:29:48,617 --> 01:29:51,418
Oh, I almost forgot.
You'll need this.

1042
01:29:53,087 --> 01:29:56,556
Give prince noctis my regards.

1043
01:29:56,558 --> 01:29:58,759
Libertus will take care
of you from here.

1044
01:29:58,761 --> 01:30:02,529
Have a safe journey,
your highness.

1045
01:30:02,531 --> 01:30:06,133
What will come of you?
What the hell are you doing?

1046
01:30:06,135 --> 01:30:08,235
Following the kings' orders.

1047
01:30:08,237 --> 01:30:11,538
I will see the ring to noctis.

1048
01:30:12,507 --> 01:30:15,142
The future will be safe.
I swear it.

1049
01:30:24,886 --> 01:30:28,522
Planning on punching your way
out of the city? Keep it.

1050
01:30:28,524 --> 01:30:30,824
Now we're even.
No.

1051
01:30:30,826 --> 01:30:33,493
We'll settle up once
you're back in galahd.

1052
01:30:33,495 --> 01:30:36,229
Me and everyone else
will be waiting for you.

1053
01:30:36,231 --> 01:30:38,932
I'm counting on you...

1054
01:30:38,934 --> 01:30:40,167
Hero.

1055
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:00,420
Buckle up, Princess.

1056
01:31:00,422 --> 01:31:02,222
My life is in your hands.

1057
01:31:11,699 --> 01:31:15,602
So the power
of the lucii returns.

1058
01:31:15,604 --> 01:31:17,437
No matter.
You are out of time.

1059
01:31:17,439 --> 01:31:19,873
For you,
I'll make some.

1060
01:31:53,307 --> 01:31:55,909
What can you hope to do?

1061
01:31:57,278 --> 01:32:00,313
One man against an empire.

1062
01:32:00,315 --> 01:32:02,249
Against the daemons.

1063
01:32:02,251 --> 01:32:06,720
How will you save insomnia
with no wall to protect you?

1064
01:32:07,822 --> 01:32:10,056
You've got it all wrong.

1065
01:32:10,058 --> 01:32:13,059
I'm not fighting
to save insomnia.

1066
01:33:37,912 --> 01:33:43,049
So this is the might
of the old wall.

1067
01:33:43,051 --> 01:33:47,320
Marvelous.
Truly marvelous.

1068
01:34:57,391 --> 01:35:00,326
Why'd you do it?

1069
01:35:00,328 --> 01:35:02,562
Lucis. Niflheim.

1070
01:35:02,564 --> 01:35:06,433
It isn't who we fight
for that matters, only what.

1071
01:35:06,435 --> 01:35:08,001
We fight for our homes.

1072
01:35:08,003 --> 01:35:10,837
That is where
our allegiance lies.

1073
01:36:29,884 --> 01:36:32,452
That's not something
you see every day.

1074
01:36:48,602 --> 01:36:51,971
Oh, such a pitiable waste.

1075
01:36:51,973 --> 01:36:54,474
All those beautiful
city streets,

1076
01:36:54,476 --> 01:36:56,976
all laid to unsightly ruin.

1077
01:36:56,978 --> 01:36:59,279
I will return to niflheim.

1078
01:36:59,281 --> 01:37:01,281
So soon?

1079
01:37:01,283 --> 01:37:03,683
The crystal is ours.

1080
01:37:03,685 --> 01:37:04,984
Finish this,

1081
01:37:04,986 --> 01:37:07,754
and see the daemons
disposed of.

1082
01:37:07,756 --> 01:37:09,455
As you command.

1083
01:37:10,859 --> 01:37:14,093
Such a pitiable waste.

1084
01:37:26,707 --> 01:37:29,576
How could you serve
the empire?

1085
01:37:29,578 --> 01:37:32,679
After everything
they did?

1086
01:37:32,681 --> 01:37:37,016
I do not fault them
for taking what was given.

1087
01:37:38,919 --> 01:37:42,088
I fault the man who gave it.

1088
01:37:42,090 --> 01:37:44,190
The man who cowered
behind his wall

1089
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:48,528
and abandoned us to save
his throne and his son.

1090
01:37:48,530 --> 01:37:51,931
Give me the ring, and our
homes will be free again.

1091
01:37:51,933 --> 01:37:54,567
The empire has promised it.

1092
01:37:54,569 --> 01:37:56,302
I don't see much of a future

1093
01:37:56,304 --> 01:37:58,972
on the other side
of that promise.

1094
01:37:58,974 --> 01:38:00,707
Don't be a fool.

1095
01:38:00,709 --> 01:38:02,609
Save your friends.

1096
01:38:03,777 --> 01:38:06,646
Give your dead sister peace.

1097
01:38:06,648 --> 01:38:09,549
What do you fight for
if not that?

1098
01:38:54,528 --> 01:38:57,463
Hang on.
This could get bumpy.

1099
01:39:06,774 --> 01:39:08,741
Drautos.

1100
01:39:16,850 --> 01:39:18,651
Here, take the wheel.

1101
01:39:26,727 --> 01:39:28,962
Floor it!

1102
01:39:38,605 --> 01:39:41,607
Libertus!
Just keep your foot on the gas.

1103
01:40:01,929 --> 01:40:04,230
You're all right?

1104
01:40:09,903 --> 01:40:12,472
I'll be waiting for you, hero.

1105
01:40:39,666 --> 01:40:41,334
What of your kings' power now?

1106
01:40:41,336 --> 01:40:45,304
They've given you a burden
you cannot hope to bear.

1107
01:40:46,673 --> 01:40:48,408
I told you before.

1108
01:40:48,410 --> 01:40:52,145
Just wanting doesn't win wars.

1109
01:42:04,284 --> 01:42:06,219
For the honor of my home,

1110
01:42:06,221 --> 01:42:09,856
I fought and killed
under a king I loathed.

1111
01:42:11,426 --> 01:42:15,828
And still he betrayed me.

1112
01:42:15,830 --> 01:42:18,030
He betrayed us all.

1113
01:42:18,032 --> 01:42:21,801
We fought for the same thing.
All of us.

1114
01:42:23,036 --> 01:42:25,238
But you've looked
too long on the past.

1115
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:27,573
You're blind to the future.

1116
01:42:32,079 --> 01:42:34,680
Predictable.

1117
01:42:34,682 --> 01:42:38,684
Unlike you,
i learn from history.

1118
01:42:38,686 --> 01:42:42,488
But you're a slave
to the past.

1119
01:42:42,490 --> 01:42:45,992
A man's past
is his pride.

1120
01:42:45,994 --> 01:42:47,226
No.

1121
01:42:47,228 --> 01:42:51,430
My pride
is shaping the future.

1122
01:43:03,710 --> 01:43:06,379
Looks like
I'm gonna owe him big.

1123
01:43:21,962 --> 01:43:24,096
We're almost there.

1124
01:43:24,098 --> 01:43:25,731
Almost.

1125
01:43:37,544 --> 01:43:42,281
King Regis did what he did
for the future.

1126
01:43:42,283 --> 01:43:45,151
Because of him,

1127
01:43:45,153 --> 01:43:47,987
there's still hope
for our homes.

1128
01:43:49,056 --> 01:43:50,957
Hope...

1129
01:43:59,933 --> 01:44:02,568
Not the worst way to go.

1130
01:44:02,570 --> 01:44:05,004
Rule well, young king.

1131
01:44:25,359 --> 01:44:27,460
We should move.

1132
01:44:28,895 --> 01:44:31,464
It ain't safe here either.

1133
01:44:33,767 --> 01:44:36,002
Hey.

1134
01:44:36,004 --> 01:44:38,271
Don't worry about nyx.

1135
01:44:39,273 --> 01:44:41,641
He can take care of himself.

1136
01:44:46,546 --> 01:44:48,314
Come on.

1137
01:44:50,183 --> 01:44:51,784
No.

1138
01:44:54,187 --> 01:44:56,689
We must part ways here.

1139
01:44:56,691 --> 01:44:58,824
What?

1140
01:44:58,826 --> 01:45:02,728
I can hardly travel in secrecy
alongside so great a hero.

1141
01:45:02,730 --> 01:45:07,700
And I, too, have
a promise to keep to nyx.

1142
01:45:07,702 --> 01:45:11,304
I pray you two see
each other again soon.

1143
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:14,874
Yeah.

1144
01:45:16,677 --> 01:45:18,544
Me too.

1145
01:45:21,181 --> 01:45:23,516
Thank you, libertus.

1146
01:45:41,034 --> 01:45:42,501
Hey, queen!

1147
01:45:42,503 --> 01:45:47,273
You and the king
are always welcome in galahd.

1148
01:45:47,275 --> 01:45:50,443
Me and nyx
will be waiting for you.

1149
01:54:46,079 --> 01:54:47,746
<i> It's been some while.</i>

1150
01:54:47,748 --> 01:54:51,683
<i> Do you remember the last time</i>
<i> you saw lady lunafreya?</i>

1151
01:54:51,685 --> 01:54:53,352
About
12 years ago.

1152
01:54:53,354 --> 01:54:56,154
That would make you 8?
You were kids.

1153
01:54:56,156 --> 01:54:57,990
Hope she hasn't
gotten her hopes up.

1154
01:54:57,992 --> 01:54:59,992
Why not? Calm yourself.

1155
01:54:59,994 --> 01:55:02,027
Try and keep it together
when you meet her.

1156
01:55:02,029 --> 01:55:03,862
She'll expect to see
a fine, young prince.

1157
01:55:03,864 --> 01:55:05,130
Tell me something
i don't know.

1158
01:55:05,132 --> 01:55:07,399
We don't have time
for all that.

1159
01:55:07,401 --> 01:55:10,235
But this is your wedding
we're talking about, noc.

1160
01:55:10,237 --> 01:55:12,271
Knew that too.

1161
01:55:12,273 --> 01:55:14,239
You really gotta calm down.

1162
01:55:14,241 --> 01:55:16,375
Uh... uh-oh.

1163
01:55:16,377 --> 01:55:18,977
What do you mean, "uh-oh"?

1164
01:55:18,979 --> 01:55:21,079
I think I know.
