That's Chesapeake Road

Others enjoyed it</i>

55

[Maren] Not all night.

00:13:09,423 --> 00:13:10,357
50.

180
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:16,296
[passengers chattering]

181
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:29,809
[Maren's father]
<i>I had a sitter for you then.</i>

182
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:32,879
[chuckles] <i>Her name was Penny.</i>

183
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:36,383
<i>When I came in,
she was on the bathroom floor.</i>

184
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:39,752
<i>There was... so much blood.</i>

185
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,722
<i>Her face was chewed up bad,</i>

186
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:45,258
<i>but the worst of it
was her neck.</i>

187
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,629
<i>She must've been holding you
when you started in on her.</i>

188
00:13:50,564 --> 00:13:51,865
<i>Her hands, all chewed up. I...</i>

189
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:55,068
<i>I thought you were dead too.</i>

190
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:56,470
<i>That somebody had done you both,</i>

191
00:13:56,537 --> 00:13:58,271
<i>but you were sleepin'.</i>

192
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:00,707
<i>When I turned you over,
I saw the blood on your mouth.</i>

193
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:05,078
<i>You had something in your cheek.</i>

194
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:08,047
<i>I fished it out. It was soft,
like a wad of gum.</i>

195
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:09,949
<i>It had a little hole in it.</i>

196
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,218
<i>Where an earring would go.</i>

197
00:14:14,455 --> 00:14:16,524
<i>I remember thanking God
she hadn't been wearing any,</i>

198
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,757
<i>you could've choked.</i>

199
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,428
<i>I got the body out,</i>

200
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:23,263
<i>I bleached the place
three times,</i>

201
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,198
<i>and then packed us up and left.</i>

202
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:26,400
<i>They never found
where I put her.</i>

203
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:31,271
<i>That was the last time
I used our real last name.</i>

204
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,107
<i>Now you know why.</i>

205
00:14:34,174 --> 00:14:36,709
<i>Nothin' happened
for a few years. I relaxed.</i>

206
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:39,879
<i>You had to start school
and I thought...</i>

207
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:41,515
<i>I thought you wouldn't
do it in public,</i>

208
00:14:41,582 --> 00:14:42,715
<i>and you didn't.</i>

209
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:44,717
<i>But you got clever.</i>

210
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:47,220
<i>So fucking clever.</i>

211
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:00,266
[sighs]

212
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:01,801
[thunder rumbling]

213
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:24,358
[rain pattering]

214
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,807
[thunder continues rumbling]

215
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:11,438
I didn't mean to scare you.

216
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:14,140
[breathing shakily]

217
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:16,809
You waiting for the bus?

218
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,214
Well, no, missy. I...

219
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:23,916
I came lookin' for you.

220
00:16:27,655 --> 00:16:28,788
Do I know you?

221
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:33,394
I guess not in the way you mean.

222
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,197
I smelled you.

223
00:16:38,264 --> 00:16:41,134
You probably smell me now.

224
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:45,004
When was the last time you fed?

225
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,342
[thunder rumbling]

226
00:16:51,545 --> 00:16:53,012
[sniffs]

227
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:55,349
[Maren] Stop, stop,
stop there. Stop.

228
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:02,288
You haven't in a long time.
[sniffs]

229
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:03,324
I'll say...

230
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:06,893
many months.

231
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,062
At least.

232
00:17:10,698 --> 00:17:12,031
You can smell that?

233
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,200
[chuckles] Oh, sure.

234
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,437
You can...

235
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:20,139
You can smell lots of things
if you know how.

236
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,140
[sniffs]

237
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:25,446
And we just smell anyway.
[laughs]

238
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:28,948
Whether we ate or not.

239
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:51,605
Hmm.

240
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:00,547
Come on, missy.

241
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,217
Come on.

242
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:15,161
Come on.

243
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,200
[Maren] Where are we goin'?

244
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:24,036
Just here,
someplace dry and safe.

245
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:26,906
I'm Sullivan.

246
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:29,676
Friends call me Sully.

247
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:32,245
Maren.

248
00:18:33,814 --> 00:18:35,047
Is this your house?

249
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,819
Listen, Maren,

250
00:18:38,886 --> 00:18:41,154
don't worry. I'm okay.

251
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:43,557
I got rules.

252
00:18:44,525 --> 00:18:46,025
One, number one

253
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:49,696
is never, never, ever
eat an Eater.

254
00:18:49,763 --> 00:18:51,498
Think you can follow that too?

255
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:54,267
All right.

256
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,235
I'll fix some dinner for us.

257
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:03,009
I smelled you from the yard,
little missy. Come on.

258
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:04,545
This far?

259
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:08,715
[Sully] Round the back.
We'll talk inside.

260
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:44,585
The Sully, he found
these little Cornish hens

261
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:47,186
in the freezer.

262
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,424
These hens,

263
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:54,160
they look like
they had a good life.

264
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,101
Thought I was the only one.

265
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,071
Are there lots of us?

266
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,373
Not lots.

267
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,075
But more...

268
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,011
more than you'd think.

269
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:15,248
You've met a few, sure,
that you know of.

270
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:17,718
[bones snapping]

271
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:21,287
You never had anyone
take a interest in you?

272
00:20:21,355 --> 00:20:23,991
[stutters] A double take?

273
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,258
[chuckles]

274
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:27,661
Just always thought...

275
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:31,732
You just thought
some people are creepy.

276
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:36,770
It's better if we all
steer clear of one another.

277
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:39,706
We're dangerous to non-Eaters,

278
00:20:39,773 --> 00:20:44,711
but we can hurt
one another just as bad.

279
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:47,481
I hope you're
hearing me on this.

280
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:49,416
[thunder rumbling]

281
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:52,218
You sound like my dad.

282
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:54,655
Your daddy find out about you?

283
00:20:59,993 --> 00:21:01,193
What about you?

284
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:05,766
You basically just said
steer clear of people like us.

285
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,036
But you came looking for me.

286
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,604
[chuckling]

287
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:12,171
Smart.

288
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:17,544
When I saw you're just
a girl on your own,

289
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:20,547
I thought...

290
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:24,785
you might be hungry.

291
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:28,622
For hens?

292
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,359
[breathing heavily]

293
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:36,630
No.

294
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:57,751
Who lives here?

295
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:01,421
Well, go and look.

296
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:13,367
[Maren sniffing]

297
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:16,135
Use your nose.

298
00:22:16,937 --> 00:22:18,338
What do you smell?

299
00:22:19,606 --> 00:22:20,874
Is there someone dead up there?

300
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:23,175
What do you smell?

301
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,746
Describe it.

302
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,684
Metallic.

303
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:34,488
Like blood?

304
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:38,792
No, like mud.

305
00:22:42,062 --> 00:22:43,497
Something tangy.

306
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:48,602
But not like rotten.

307
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:51,304
No.

308
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:55,942
But close.

309
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,745
More like vinegar.

310
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:03,617
Like vinegar in the soup.

311
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:07,354
Yeah. Yeah.

312
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:18,965
[Maren sniffing]

313
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:39,119
[breathing laboriously]

314
00:23:39,186 --> 00:23:41,021
- She's alive.
- [Sully] Missy.

315
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:42,422
- We'll get help.
- Missy.

316
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:44,191
What did you do to her?

317
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,525
I found her like that
this mornin'.

318
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:47,527
You're lying. Let me by.

319
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:50,597
Listen.
Let me bone down on this.

320
00:23:51,498 --> 00:23:52,799
Whatever you and I got,

321
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,035
it's gotta be fed.

322
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:56,803
[breathing shakily]

323
00:23:58,605 --> 00:23:59,740
No. Uh...

324
00:24:01,141 --> 00:24:02,743
No, 'cause it was...

325
00:24:04,377 --> 00:24:06,813
It was years
before my last time.

326
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,516
[sighs]
That's because you're young.

327
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:14,354
You're gonna need it
more and more,

328
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:16,757
- and more and more.
- [whimpering]

329
00:24:16,823 --> 00:24:21,260
And you won't always be able
to hold yourself back.

330
00:24:21,328 --> 00:24:23,830
But if the circumstances is...

331
00:24:24,765 --> 00:24:26,466
is safe and good,

332
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:28,702
then eat.

333
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,270
It'll last a while,

334
00:24:31,338 --> 00:24:34,207
maybe it'll keep you from,

335
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:36,777
you know,
doing something you'll regret.

336
00:24:39,012 --> 00:24:41,014
[Maren continues whimpering]

337
00:24:41,882 --> 00:24:42,816
Even more.

338
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:45,485
Even more, missy.

339
00:24:48,755 --> 00:24:50,891
Yes, Sully found her that way.

340
00:24:51,925 --> 00:24:52,959
I followed my nose.

341
00:24:56,763 --> 00:24:59,366
I don't...
I don't kill people.

342
00:25:01,635 --> 00:25:03,537
At least I try not to.

343
00:25:06,406 --> 00:25:07,941
That leaves this.

344
00:25:10,277 --> 00:25:12,746
- And things like it.
- [sniffles]

345
00:25:20,954 --> 00:25:21,888
[sniffles]

346
00:25:24,391 --> 00:25:26,293
Can I have
a few minutes, please?

347
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,594
Sure, you can.

348
00:25:31,765 --> 00:25:34,701
I don't think
it'll be a long time now.

349
00:25:34,768 --> 00:25:37,537
When the time comes,
you'll smell it.

350
00:25:40,674 --> 00:25:42,776
[woman breathing laboriously]

351
00:26:03,997 --> 00:26:05,665
[woman gagging]

352
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:09,502
[stops breathing]

353
00:26:12,005 --> 00:26:13,440
[sniffling]

354
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,145
- [soft footsteps]
- [Sully breathing heavily]

355
00:26:25,018 --> 00:26:25,952
[Sully clears throat]

356
00:26:28,622 --> 00:26:32,058
- [body being dragged]
- [Sully grunting]

357
00:26:33,493 --> 00:26:34,628
[body thuds]

358
00:26:39,367 --> 00:26:41,568
- [sniffs]
- [Sully coughing]

00:26:42,602 --> 00:26:45,872
[crunching and slurping]

360
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:01,721
[Maren breathes excitedly]

01:13:04,216 --> 01:13:05,352
There.

1058
01:13:14,695 --> 01:13:16,963
- I'll come with you.
- No, stay here.

1059
01:13:29,409 --> 01:13:31,712
Excuse me?
Are you Barbara Kerns?

1060
01:13:40,252 --> 01:13:42,422
Wait, wait. Ms. Kerns.
Ms. Kerns.

1061
01:13:43,156 --> 01:13:44,357
I'm Maren Yearly.

1062
01:13:44,958 --> 01:13:46,660
Maren.

1063
01:13:46,727 --> 01:13:48,695
I've traveled a very long way.

1064
01:13:57,370 --> 01:13:59,072
Oh, they didn't marry.

1065
01:13:59,139 --> 01:14:00,707
Hmm. Yeah, we wondered.

1066
01:14:01,273 --> 01:14:02,409
Huh.

1067
01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:07,981
My husband, uh,
he died years ago.

1068
01:14:08,048 --> 01:14:09,516
Throat cancer.

1069
01:14:09,583 --> 01:14:11,818
- Sorry.
- Mm.

1070
01:14:11,885 --> 01:14:13,954
Sorry to surprise you like this.

1071
01:14:15,756 --> 01:14:18,692
You didn't know your daughter
had a child, I guess.

1072
01:14:19,659 --> 01:14:20,994
No.

1073
01:14:21,061 --> 01:14:23,897
No. When she wanted
to get married,

1074
01:14:24,798 --> 01:14:25,732
we didn't agree.

1075
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:29,836
So, it drove her away. Yeah.

1076
01:14:32,572 --> 01:14:34,608
Where did she meet my dad?

1077
01:14:36,209 --> 01:14:37,410
He didn't say?

1078
01:14:38,645 --> 01:14:40,714
He wouldn't say
anything about her.

1079
01:14:41,982 --> 01:14:42,916
Ah.

1080
01:14:43,884 --> 01:14:45,852
Hmm. Mm.

1081
01:14:47,954 --> 01:14:48,922
[sighs]

1082
01:14:57,364 --> 01:15:00,500
They met in college.
Down in Mankato.

1083
01:15:01,434 --> 01:15:02,903
She finished two years

1084
01:15:02,969 --> 01:15:04,538
before he talked her
into leaving.

1085
01:15:05,939 --> 01:15:08,408
Did he drive you here?
Is he outside?

1086
01:15:08,475 --> 01:15:10,944
No. He's in Maryland.

1087
01:15:14,447 --> 01:15:16,416
Does he know you're here?

1088
01:15:16,483 --> 01:15:18,351
Yeah, he let me know
where to find you.

1089
01:15:19,286 --> 01:15:20,787
So you haven't run away?

1090
01:15:21,354 --> 01:15:22,422
No.

1091
01:15:22,489 --> 01:15:23,924
My dad thinks that

1092
01:15:23,990 --> 01:15:25,492
I'm old enough
to live on my own.

1093
01:15:25,559 --> 01:15:27,494
Oh. Uh-huh.

1094
01:15:27,561 --> 01:15:30,530
Well, if you're looking for
a home with your mother,

1095
01:15:31,798 --> 01:15:32,766
um,

1096
01:15:33,633 --> 01:15:35,468
I'm sorry to tell you

1097
01:15:35,535 --> 01:15:38,071
that she...
she's no longer with us.

1098
01:15:41,074 --> 01:15:42,576
What? When?

1099
01:15:42,642 --> 01:15:44,344
It's a lot of years now,

1100
01:15:44,411 --> 01:15:46,580
and it's nothing
I wanna tell you about.

1101
01:15:46,646 --> 01:15:48,148
I hope you can respect that.

1102
01:15:48,215 --> 01:15:49,549
Well, I'm her daughter.

1103
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:52,385
Yep. Makes sense now.

1104
01:15:52,452 --> 01:15:56,723
Why she came back so bereaved.
That's the word.

1105
01:15:57,924 --> 01:16:00,026
And she wouldn't tell us
anything, either.

1106
01:16:01,561 --> 01:16:05,432
Oh, it's just so much hiding
in one family.

1107
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,135
I'm sorry you had to be
the child of it all.

1108
01:16:11,538 --> 01:16:13,807
Wait. What was
she like as a child?

1109
01:16:16,243 --> 01:16:17,444
Hmm.

1110
01:16:23,483 --> 01:16:25,485
Wow. She was your only child?

1111
01:16:25,552 --> 01:16:27,187
[Barbara] Well, not even ours.

1112
01:16:27,254 --> 01:16:30,056
Bob and I never could have
babies of our own.

1113
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:33,093
But then we heard about Janelle.

1114
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,595
She'd been left behind

1115
01:16:35,662 --> 01:16:37,964
a sheriff's station in Bemidji.

1116
01:16:38,031 --> 01:16:39,666
It was in the paper.

1117
01:16:39,733 --> 01:16:42,402
You know anything
about her biological parents?

1118
01:16:42,469 --> 01:16:43,937
No, nothing.

1119
01:16:44,004 --> 01:16:45,739
Except what they did
to their baby.

1120
01:16:45,805 --> 01:16:48,408
I mean, she could have froze,
you know.

1121
01:16:48,475 --> 01:16:50,443
It's cold here all the time.

1122
01:16:52,545 --> 01:16:54,348
My mother...

1123
01:16:54,414 --> 01:16:56,650
You can, you know, take those
photos if you want 'em.

1124
01:16:56,716 --> 01:16:58,151
Did she ever hurt anyone?

1125
01:16:59,753 --> 01:17:01,588
What kind of question is that?

1126
01:17:02,889 --> 01:17:06,559
I bet she did. I know she did.

1127
01:17:06,626 --> 01:17:08,495
I don't know what you had
to do to cover it up

1128
01:17:08,561 --> 01:17:11,064
or... how much pain
it caused you.

1129
01:17:11,131 --> 01:17:12,799
Stop this. At once.

1130
01:17:12,866 --> 01:17:15,168
Look, you're never
going to see me again, okay?

1131
01:17:15,235 --> 01:17:18,738
You may not be her family
by blood, but I am.

1132
01:17:18,805 --> 01:17:20,408
And I need to know.

1133
01:17:20,473 --> 01:17:22,709
So, please, Mrs. Kerns,
please...

1134
01:17:22,776 --> 01:17:24,611
Then ask her yourself.

1135
01:17:28,114 --> 01:17:29,082
How?

1136
01:17:31,918 --> 01:17:32,852
[sighs]

1137
01:17:33,753 --> 01:17:36,122
Look, I don't know you.

1138
01:17:36,189 --> 01:17:37,857
You gotta understand.

1139
01:17:37,924 --> 01:17:39,659
I didn't know what you wanted
comin' up here.

1140
01:17:39,726 --> 01:17:41,194
And I hope you mean what you say

1141
01:17:41,261 --> 01:17:43,096
about never coming back here.

1142
01:17:43,163 --> 01:17:47,934
I know that sounds cold,
but I wanna be clear with ya.

1143
01:17:48,001 --> 01:17:50,303
I told you she was
no longer with us,

1144
01:17:50,371 --> 01:17:52,939
but she's not...
she's not dead.

1145
01:17:54,741 --> 01:17:58,144
She's living in a town
called Fergus Falls.

1146
01:17:59,279 --> 01:18:00,513
In a state hospital there.

1147
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:02,549
And we didn't put her there,

1148
01:18:02,615 --> 01:18:04,284
if that's what you're thinkin'.

1149
01:18:04,352 --> 01:18:06,320
She signed her own papers.

1150
01:18:06,387 --> 01:18:07,520
[door opens]

1151
01:18:09,289 --> 01:18:10,490
[door closes]

1152
01:18:18,765 --> 01:18:20,166
[panting] Okay.

1153
01:18:29,809 --> 01:18:32,846
Here. My mother's here.

1154
01:19:13,487 --> 01:19:14,621
Do you want me to come in?

1155
01:19:15,356 --> 01:19:16,289
No.

1156
01:19:38,546 --> 01:19:40,414
[nurse] Mrs. Kerns' daughter.

1157
01:19:40,481 --> 01:19:43,883
I sure didn't expect this
when I woke up this morning.

1158
01:19:45,486 --> 01:19:46,986
[muffled shouting]

1159
01:19:48,254 --> 01:19:49,523
[woman screaming]

1160
01:19:49,589 --> 01:19:51,057
[woman 2] Calm down.

1161
01:19:53,427 --> 01:19:54,661
Calm down.

1162
01:19:55,396 --> 01:19:57,331
Is she dangerous?

1163
01:19:57,398 --> 01:20:00,066
It's been many years
since that was a concern.

1164
01:20:00,133 --> 01:20:01,968
[woman 3 crying]

1165
01:20:03,703 --> 01:20:05,271
Why was it ever one?

1166
01:20:05,339 --> 01:20:08,309
Aggression towards the staff.
Self-harm.

1167
01:20:09,310 --> 01:20:10,710
But long ago.

1168
01:20:12,612 --> 01:20:14,348
[keys jingling]

1169
01:20:14,415 --> 01:20:17,117
It's possible she won't
understand who you are.

1170
01:20:18,218 --> 01:20:19,619
She just took her morning meds,

1171
01:20:19,686 --> 01:20:21,621
so she may nod off anyhow.

1172
01:20:22,288 --> 01:20:23,890
We'll see.

1173
01:20:23,957 --> 01:20:26,025
There's someone here
to see you, Ms. Kerns.

1174
01:20:26,092 --> 01:20:29,229
A surprise.
A wonderful surprise.

1175
01:20:54,488 --> 01:20:55,655
[Maren] It's Maren.

1176
01:20:57,391 --> 01:20:58,325
I'm Maren.

1177
01:21:03,597 --> 01:21:04,697
Can't she speak?

1178
01:21:04,764 --> 01:21:05,999
It's the medication.

1179
01:21:07,535 --> 01:21:10,069
[whimpers, breathing shakily]

1180
01:21:10,136 --> 01:21:11,938
Easy, Ms. Kerns.

1181
01:21:16,075 --> 01:21:17,911
I didn't come with Dad.

1182
01:21:19,513 --> 01:21:22,682
I didn't come with Dad.
Just came by myself.

1183
01:21:24,951 --> 01:21:26,387
Should I give her
the letter, Ms. Kerns?

1184
01:21:26,453 --> 01:21:27,687
I fetched it on the way up.

1185
01:21:27,754 --> 01:21:29,956
[whimpering]

1186
01:21:34,361 --> 01:21:38,131
She wrote this about
15 years ago now, must be.

1187
01:21:38,198 --> 01:21:41,901
I've kept it safe in her file
out there, in case.

1188
01:21:48,708 --> 01:21:49,943
She knew I'd come?

1189
01:21:51,645 --> 01:21:53,012
I'll wait right over here.

1190
01:22:05,626 --> 01:22:10,964
[Janelle] <i>Maren, if a day comes</i>
<i>when you show up here,</i>

1191
01:22:11,030 --> 01:22:15,034
<i>I'll know it's because

1192
01:22:16,069 --> 01:22:17,971
<i>Told you something about me.</i>

1195

<i>but he figured it out

1198
01:22:34,655 --> 01:22:38,659
<i>It wasn't easy to leave.
I loved you both so much.</i>

1199
01:22:38,726 --> 01:22:40,527
<i>I thought about ending my life,</i>

1200

1201

<i>All we can have

1205

[Maren] No! Help me!

1214
01:23:32,646 --> 01:23:34,581
Ms. Kerns, calm down!

1215
01:23:35,449 --> 01:23:37,318
Maren, die.

1216
01:23:38,951 --> 01:23:40,253
[Maren] Let me out. Let me out.

1217
01:23:40,321 --> 01:23:41,988
Press the button
on the door. Go!

1218

[door rattling]

1221
01:23:54,535 --> 01:23:56,403
I can't open the door.
I can't open the door.

1222
01:23:56,470 --> 01:23:58,204
[Lee] Sorry, sorry.
Here we go, here we go.

1223
01:23:58,271 --> 01:24:00,106
[Maren] I can't
fucking with the door.

1224
01:24:00,173 --> 01:24:01,575
[Lee] You're good.

1225
01:24:01,642 --> 01:24:03,344
[Maren] She's one of us.

1226
01:24:03,410 --> 01:24:04,944
She's one of us
but she's fucking nuts.

1227
01:24:05,011 --> 01:24:06,814
She ate her own fucking hands.

1228
01:24:06,879 --> 01:24:08,315
She said she loved my dad.

1229
01:24:08,382 --> 01:24:09,583
She said she wanted to be a mom.

1230
01:24:10,617 --> 01:24:12,251
She could have stayed.

1231
01:24:12,319 --> 01:24:14,187
She could have told me
what I needed to know.

1232
01:24:14,253 --> 01:24:16,222
But all of this...
Fuck, you know how different

1233
01:24:16,289 --> 01:24:18,091
this would've been if I'd had
one person on my side?

1234
01:24:18,157 --> 01:24:20,226
One person to talk to?

1235
01:24:20,293 --> 01:24:22,195
You know what
I wouldn't have done?

1236
01:24:22,261 --> 01:24:24,365
Maybe, probably half
of what I've fucking done!

1237
01:24:25,131 --> 01:24:26,767
Fuck her. Fuck.

1238
01:24:26,834 --> 01:24:28,167
[Lee] You know, if she'd stayed,

1239
01:24:28,234 --> 01:24:30,103
she might have hurt you, Maren.

1240
01:24:30,169 --> 01:24:32,539
Or worse, you might not even
be here right now.

1241
01:24:32,606 --> 01:24:34,375
Trust me, I know what I'm
talking about with this stuff.

1242
01:24:34,441 --> 01:24:36,142
This is better than
what I went through.

1243
01:24:36,209 --> 01:24:38,177
Please just stop
fucking talking!

1244
01:24:39,879 --> 01:24:41,881
You're pissed off, and you're
scared, and you feel alone,

1245
01:24:41,948 --> 01:24:44,183
and you don't know what to do
with it all, it's fine.

1246
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:45,652
If you wanna go at yourself
with that, I can't stop you.

1247
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:47,654
But don't come at me.

1248
01:24:48,689 --> 01:24:50,858
You slit his throat, Lee.

1249
01:24:50,923 --> 01:24:53,192
- He had a wife. Kids.
- Okay.

1250
01:24:53,259 --> 01:24:55,429
I think you got used
to being locked up

1251
01:24:55,496 --> 01:24:57,263
and invisible and alone, and
now you're out in the world...

1252
01:24:57,331 --> 01:24:59,232
- Okay, okay.
- ...and you're seeing yourself

1253
01:24:59,298 --> 01:25:01,200
for the first time,
and that's freaking you out.

1254
01:25:01,267 --> 01:25:03,437
But you know what?
It's fucking me up too, okay?

1255
01:25:03,504 --> 01:25:04,904
I feel like I'm seeing myself
too. That's how this works.

1256
01:25:04,971 --> 01:25:06,407
- How what works?
- This!

1257
01:25:06,473 --> 01:25:07,474
Whatever this is.

1258
01:25:10,943 --> 01:25:12,813
Stop. You're wrong,
you're wrong.

1259
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,515
What? About which part
am I wrong?

1260
01:25:14,581 --> 01:25:16,784
I can't be around you anymore.
I can't think.

1261
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:18,318
Jesus Christ.

1262
01:25:18,385 --> 01:25:20,019
We don't have
many options, Maren.

1263
01:25:20,086 --> 01:25:21,988
Either you eat,
you off yourself,

1264
01:25:22,054 --> 01:25:23,891
or you lock yourself up
like her in there.

1265
01:25:23,956 --> 01:25:25,124
What's it gonna be?

1266
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:28,362
Why can't you let me have this?

1267
01:25:30,397 --> 01:25:31,331
[sighs]

1268
01:25:34,902 --> 01:25:36,102
No.

1269
01:25:37,538 --> 01:25:41,207
I'm not going to be her.
I'm not going to be her.

1270
01:25:41,974 --> 01:25:43,544
You can decide no.

1271
01:25:43,610 --> 01:25:46,279
And I'm deciding that
right fucking now.

1272
01:26:49,877 --> 01:26:51,143
I'm just getting gas.

1273
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:54,146
You have the money.

1274
01:26:58,652 --> 01:26:59,786
[Lee sighs]

1275
01:28:10,857 --> 01:28:12,091
[Lee] Maren!

1276
01:28:15,062 --> 01:28:16,396
Maren!

1277
01:29:13,152 --> 01:29:18,190

Hey, hey.

1283
01:29:35,609 --> 01:29:38,745
You ain't sad to see
old Sully, are you, missy?

1284
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:41,915
It worked out. [chuckling]

1285
01:29:42,949 --> 01:29:43,917
I hardly believe it.

1286
01:29:46,252 --> 01:29:48,287
You've been following me
since Frederick?

1287
01:29:48,822 --> 01:29:50,357
[laughs]

1288
01:29:50,424 --> 01:29:53,493
I know.
It seems crazy to me too. I...

1289
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:56,697
I just didn't... I didn't know
what else to do.

1290
01:29:56,763 --> 01:29:57,831
Why, Sully?

1291
01:29:58,999 --> 01:30:00,834
Well, because we...

1292
01:30:00,901 --> 01:30:04,504
we didn't have a chance
to say our goodbyes.

1293
01:30:04,571 --> 01:30:08,475
And I've been worrying on you
on your own as you are.

1294
01:30:09,576 --> 01:30:11,912
Why not say hello earlier then?

1295
01:30:11,978 --> 01:30:13,880
Oh, no, no, missy. I don't...

1296
01:30:13,947 --> 01:30:16,116
I don't interrupt.
That's bad manners,

1297
01:30:16,183 --> 01:30:17,718
and you were with a friend.

1298
01:30:17,784 --> 01:30:21,154
And where'd he go now?
I saw him.

1299
01:30:21,220 --> 01:30:23,657
Took off out of here fast.

1300
01:30:23,724 --> 01:30:26,093
Is he your new boyfriend?
Is he?

1301
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:27,761
[Maren] No, no, no.

1302
01:30:27,828 --> 01:30:29,930
Or just a hobo
you're hanging around with?

1303
01:30:30,997 --> 01:30:32,199
No, I'm just a friend.

1304
01:30:32,264 --> 01:30:33,734
Oh, just a friend.

1305
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:36,837
Maybe he didn't get
that telegram.

1306
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:41,408
He one of us?

1307
01:30:48,482 --> 01:30:51,485
Follow your nose
or he follow his?

1308
01:30:52,753 --> 01:30:55,088
- [Maren] Both.
- [laughing]

1309
01:30:55,155 --> 01:30:56,490
Thanks for showing me how.

1310
01:30:56,556 --> 01:30:57,958
[continues laughing]

1311
01:30:59,926 --> 01:31:01,928
Hey, count the bugs.

1312
01:31:03,897 --> 01:31:06,433
Well, life's never dully
with Sully.

1313
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:08,267
What do you say? Uh...

1314
01:31:09,369 --> 01:31:12,372
What do you say?
You wanna, uh,

1315
01:31:12,439 --> 01:31:14,674
take a ride with Sully
for a bit?

1316
01:31:17,344 --> 01:31:19,646
It's weird that
you've been following me.

1317
01:31:19,713 --> 01:31:21,548
It's only been
a couple of weeks.

1318
01:31:21,615 --> 01:31:24,384
Life will get weirder,
I promise. I promise.

1319
01:31:26,953 --> 01:31:27,921
I liked...

1320
01:31:31,792 --> 01:31:34,461
I liked our talk.

1321
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:39,466
Oh, it's a hard and lonesome
road for us, isn't it?

1322
01:31:39,533 --> 01:31:42,936
So, there's no sense
in making it lonelier

1323
01:31:43,003 --> 01:31:45,372
[stammering]
if you don't have to.

1324
01:31:46,273 --> 01:31:47,407
- I'm a girl.
- I know.

1325
01:31:47,474 --> 01:31:48,942
About my daughter's age,

1326
01:31:49,009 --> 01:31:50,443
if I had one. [chuckles]

1327
01:31:51,545 --> 01:31:52,712
Is that what this is?

1328
01:31:57,017 --> 01:31:58,051
[sighs]

1329
01:31:59,986 --> 01:32:01,488
How do you like that?

1330
01:32:03,723 --> 01:32:08,695
Sully, I'm not trying
to upset you. Mm-hmm.

1331
01:32:08,762 --> 01:32:12,332
Just, I know
you drove a long way.

1332
01:32:14,568 --> 01:32:16,903
I don't feel
comfortable with this.

1333
01:32:16,970 --> 01:32:20,407
You've never fit
with someone before?

1334
01:32:21,374 --> 01:32:22,509
I have.

1335
01:32:23,510 --> 01:32:25,745
It's just gotta go both ways.

1336
01:32:31,451 --> 01:32:32,586
[sighs]

1337
01:32:37,390 --> 01:32:38,959
You don't like Sully.

1338
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:41,728
Why do you say your name

1339
01:32:41,795 --> 01:32:43,063
like you're
two different people?

1340
01:32:43,129 --> 01:32:44,264
You don't like me.

1341
01:32:44,332 --> 01:32:46,199
No, I don't trust you.

1342
01:32:46,266 --> 01:32:48,568
It doesn't matter if I'm right
or if I'm wrong about that,

1343
01:32:48,635 --> 01:32:50,537
it just matters that I feel it.

1344
01:32:52,739 --> 01:32:54,875
So you're not gettin' in?

1345
01:32:56,943 --> 01:32:57,944
Not gettin' in.

1346
01:33:03,550 --> 01:33:06,953
Fuck you, then.

1347
01:33:10,190 --> 01:33:12,692
Fuck you, missy.

1348
01:33:16,429 --> 01:33:18,431
You dumb cunt!

1349
01:33:24,771 --> 01:33:25,705
I...

1350
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:30,543
I dried off next to you.

1351
01:33:32,012 --> 01:33:37,083
I've never done that
with anyone before.

1352
01:33:39,753 --> 01:33:41,788
That means something.

1353
01:33:47,494 --> 01:33:49,796
I dried off next to...

01:33:56,303 --> 01:33:57,671

you gonna tell her

1360
01:34:40,914 --> 01:34:42,182
before she starts to listen?

1361
01:34:44,352 --> 01:34:46,186
[waitress] Hi, guys.
[officer] Hey, Sheila.

1362
01:34:46,252 --> 01:34:47,620
- Good to see you.
- [waitress] Be right with you.

I don't know.
Just come on, Daddy, watch me.

1367
01:36:02,962 --> 01:36:04,498
Watch me.

all over here. Get over here.

how are you doin'?

01:37:36,789 --> 01:37:38,858
No, I'm driving home.
I'm good.

1402
01:37:40,827 --> 01:37:43,397
- [exhales heavily]
<i>- Can I tell Mom you're coming?</i>

1403
01:37:45,566 --> 01:37:46,833
Sure you can.

1404
01:37:48,735 --> 01:37:49,936
Sure.

1405
01:37:51,204 --> 01:37:53,740
- [line disconnects]
- [breathes deeply]

1406
01:38:06,286 --> 01:38:09,222
I don't even care about chores.

1407
01:38:09,289 --> 01:38:10,990
- [LAUGHTER]
- That's all I care about.

1408
01:38:11,057 --> 01:38:12,759
- It's so...
- You're right.

1409
01:38:12,825 --> 01:38:14,328
[Kayla] I mean,
I cared about it before,

1410
01:38:14,395 --> 01:38:15,563
- but not anymore.
- [girl] Yeah. Exactly.

1411
01:38:15,629 --> 01:38:16,763
Hey, Kayla.

1412
01:38:18,932 --> 01:38:20,934
I'm Maren, Lee's friend.

1413
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,269
I met you at your aunt's house
a couple of months back.

1414
01:38:25,238 --> 01:38:26,172
I remember.

1415
01:38:27,608 --> 01:38:29,142
I'll talk to y'all in a minute.

1416
01:38:30,511 --> 01:38:33,112
[Maren] Yeah, I wanted
to say hi then, but...

1417
01:38:35,649 --> 01:38:36,783
Do you know where Lee is?

1418
01:38:37,984 --> 01:38:39,620
He was at my aunt's house
for a while,

1419
01:38:39,687 --> 01:38:41,921
but my mom
wouldn't leave him alone,

1420
01:38:41,988 --> 01:38:44,325
so he took his tent
and moved out to the lake.

1421
01:38:45,291 --> 01:38:46,594
Which lake?

1422
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:48,495
Um, Land Between the Lakes.

1423
01:38:48,562 --> 01:38:50,331
It's a state park down 641.

1424
01:38:51,965 --> 01:38:53,967
He comes into town
when he wants to.

1425
01:38:54,767 --> 01:38:56,604
Well, he's just...

1426
01:38:56,670 --> 01:38:58,071
going through something,
I guess.

1427
01:38:59,473 --> 01:39:01,107
But I asked him about you

1428
01:39:01,174 --> 01:39:02,875
and he just said that
you went another way.

1429
01:39:04,043 --> 01:39:05,945
I wondered
why he's been staying.

1430
01:39:06,012 --> 01:39:07,981
I guess he was hoping
that you'd show up, right?

1431
01:39:10,149 --> 01:39:11,951
No, I don't know about that.

1432
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:15,255
I don't know if he'd actually
even want to see me,

1433
01:39:15,989 --> 01:39:17,890
to be honest.

1434
01:39:17,957 --> 01:39:19,092
I know he was trying
to get back to you, though.

1435
01:39:20,427 --> 01:39:21,794
He said that?

1436
01:39:22,962 --> 01:39:25,599
[chuckles]
God, he's an asshole.

1437
01:39:25,666 --> 01:39:27,233
Why is he even like this,
you know?

1438
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:29,002
I tell him no one even remembers

1439
01:39:29,068 --> 01:39:31,204
all that stuff
with the cops anymore.

1440
01:39:31,271 --> 01:39:33,940
It was three stupid days
and they let him go.

1441
01:39:34,007 --> 01:39:35,309
This is about your dad?

1442
01:39:36,443 --> 01:39:37,810
He didn't tell you?

1443
01:39:40,514 --> 01:39:42,181
Our dad's a drunk.

1444
01:39:42,248 --> 01:39:45,419
So drunk that he'd piss
on the wall kinda guy.

1445
01:39:45,486 --> 01:39:47,354
He got in Lee's face
a couple of times

1446
01:39:47,421 --> 01:39:49,188
and Lee would, you know,
try to calm him down,

1447
01:39:49,255 --> 01:39:51,725
and the day he left,
he wound up hitting Lee.

1448
01:39:51,791 --> 01:39:55,061
And when I tried to
break 'em up, he hit me, too.

1449
01:39:56,996 --> 01:39:58,332
Lee just lost it,

1450
01:39:58,399 --> 01:40:00,334
and he told me to call the cops.

1451
01:40:00,401 --> 01:40:03,102
And when our dad ripped
the phone out of the wall,

1452
01:40:03,169 --> 01:40:05,905
Lee got him in a headlock.
He told me to run into town.

1453
01:40:07,374 --> 01:40:09,242
And when I got back
with the cops,

1454
01:40:09,310 --> 01:40:12,346
Lee was pretty beat up
and Dad's car was gone.

1455
01:40:12,413 --> 01:40:13,846
And Lee told 'em
that he took off,

1456
01:40:13,913 --> 01:40:15,815
but there was blood on Lee,

1457
01:40:15,882 --> 01:40:17,150
so they had to put him
in a holding cell

1458
01:40:17,216 --> 01:40:19,018
so they could test it.

1459
01:40:19,085 --> 01:40:22,021
And for a minute there,
everyone was like,

1460
01:40:22,088 --> 01:40:24,057
<i>"Lee killed him,
Lee killed him."</i>

1461
01:40:24,123 --> 01:40:26,159
<i>But it was all Lee's blood.</i>

1462
01:40:26,225 --> 01:40:27,927
<i>It was all bullshit,
and they had to let him go.</i>

1463
01:40:28,961 --> 01:40:30,930
<i>And that was four years ago,</i>

1464
01:40:30,997 --> 01:40:32,999
<i>and he's been out of town
for three and a half of 'em.</i>

1465
01:40:34,401 --> 01:40:35,436
<i>It's not fair.</i>

1466
01:40:36,969 --> 01:40:38,472
<i>It's not fair.</i>

1467
01:40:38,539 --> 01:40:40,073
[children chattering]

1468
01:40:41,974 --> 01:40:43,176
[Maren] Lee!

1469
01:41:20,481 --> 01:41:22,281
- [fireworks exploding]
- [dog barking]

1470
01:41:22,349 --> 01:41:24,016
- [people exclaiming]
- [Maren] Your tent.

1471
01:41:24,083 --> 01:41:26,886
We should really use it.
Just get lost.

1472
01:41:27,855 --> 01:41:28,988
[Lee] Where do you want to go?

1473
01:41:30,457 --> 01:41:34,026
I don't know. Anywhere.
West. Let's go west.

1474
01:41:45,672 --> 01:41:46,973
[laughs]

1475
01:42:19,473 --> 01:42:21,240
[mechanic]
It's your rod bearings then.

1476
01:42:21,308 --> 01:42:23,510
[Lee] Seriously? Shit!

1477
01:42:23,577 --> 01:42:25,044
That means a new engine.

1478
01:42:25,111 --> 01:42:26,613
I'd rather just sell it
for parts.

1479
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:28,147
Tell you what,
you make me a good offer,

1480
01:42:28,214 --> 01:42:30,049
I'll sell it to you right now.

1481
01:42:30,116 --> 01:42:31,518
[splutters] You don't
want to sell it out here.

1482
01:42:31,585 --> 01:42:32,952
- [Lee] Why?
- Look around, man.

1483
01:42:34,321 --> 01:42:35,522
How you gonna get home?

1484
01:42:36,623 --> 01:42:37,658
I don't know.

1485
01:43:09,989 --> 01:43:11,492
You do go someplace else.

1486
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:13,927
[Maren] Watching me read?

1487
01:43:13,993 --> 01:43:15,127
[Lee] Yeah.

1488
01:43:17,598 --> 01:43:20,132
[Maren] Well, you should know
after this, I'm out of books.

1489
01:43:20,199 --> 01:43:22,235
I'll have to go to a bookstore.

1490
01:43:22,301 --> 01:43:24,505
[Lee] May have to stop
on the way back, in Omaha.

1491
01:43:25,672 --> 01:43:27,374
By the way,
those guys were saying

1492
01:43:27,441 --> 01:43:29,275
we should have two days
of water with us

1493
01:43:29,343 --> 01:43:31,478
in case the engine gives out.

1494
01:43:31,545 --> 01:43:33,145
In case we have
to wait on a ride.

1495
01:43:35,449 --> 01:43:37,718
We should get some new wheels
as soon as we can.

1496
01:43:39,218 --> 01:43:41,087
I wish we could save it.

1497
01:43:42,054 --> 01:43:43,724
I'd rather have a van, anyway.

1498
01:43:45,157 --> 01:43:46,693
I learned how to drive
in that truck.

1499
01:43:46,760 --> 01:43:48,328
You learned how to kiss
in that truck.

1500
01:43:49,696 --> 01:43:52,499
I knew how to kiss before you,
Mr. Kentucky.

1501
01:43:52,566 --> 01:43:53,500
Ah.

1502
01:44:02,009 --> 01:44:03,644
I sang to my girl in that truck.

1503
01:44:25,465 --> 01:44:26,833
Kayla told me about...

1504
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:29,603
what happened with your dad.

1505
01:44:32,071 --> 01:44:33,507
Kayla doesn't know
what happened.

1506
01:44:35,141 --> 01:44:36,944
He sounds like
he was a fucking asshole.

1507
01:44:37,010 --> 01:44:38,144
[Lee] I don't wanna...

1508
01:44:39,379 --> 01:44:40,747
I don't want to talk
about my dad.

1509
01:44:42,248 --> 01:44:44,318
I don't sweat this stuff out
like you do.

1510
01:44:50,991 --> 01:44:53,493
You know, Kayla said that he...

1511
01:44:54,795 --> 01:44:56,863
that he hit you both
the day that he left.

1512
01:44:57,798 --> 01:44:58,732
That's true.

1513
01:45:02,301 --> 01:45:04,136
Told her to get the cops.
She did.

1514
01:45:05,939 --> 01:45:07,106
And then he left.

1515
01:45:10,477 --> 01:45:13,245
I don't know, I don't
really believe that. I mean,

1516
01:45:13,313 --> 01:45:15,549
there must've been a lot of blood
on you for the cops to bring you in.

1517
01:45:15,616 --> 01:45:18,485
If you wanna know, Maren,
he came for me, okay?

1518
01:45:18,552 --> 01:45:20,320
He tried to rip me open
with his teeth.

1519
01:45:24,891 --> 01:45:27,293
That's the first time
I ever smelled it on someone.

1520
01:45:46,847 --> 01:45:47,914
What happened after that?

1521
01:45:51,818 --> 01:45:53,185
[Lee sighs]

1522
01:45:55,555 --> 01:45:56,490
Lee,

1523
01:45:57,357 --> 01:45:58,659
you can tell me.

1524
01:46:03,330 --> 01:46:05,465
[Lee sighs, tuts]

1525
01:46:05,532 --> 01:46:07,768
[exhales heavily] He, uh...

1526
01:46:07,834 --> 01:46:08,835
He passed out.

1527
01:46:11,237 --> 01:46:14,775
I got him in a... I put him
in a fucking... [sniffles]

1528
01:46:14,841 --> 01:46:18,912
headlock, and bashed
an ashtray over his head.

1529
01:46:21,848 --> 01:46:24,384
Dragged his fucking body
to his car.

1530
01:46:25,419 --> 01:46:26,687
Put him in the car,

1531
01:46:27,988 --> 01:46:30,857
and I drove to this barn
about a mile outside town

1532
01:46:30,924 --> 01:46:32,224
that I knew was abandoned.

1533
01:46:36,063 --> 01:46:37,330
[sniffles]

1534
01:46:40,033 --> 01:46:41,601
How long was he in the barn?

1535
01:46:49,776 --> 01:46:51,210
Uh, three days.

1536
01:46:52,112 --> 01:46:53,480
I think, yeah.

1537
01:46:59,453 --> 01:47:00,687
Three days.

1538
01:47:06,927 --> 01:47:08,562
I duct-taped the shit
out of him too.

1539
01:47:08,628 --> 01:47:10,229
Everywhere except his nostrils,

1540
01:47:10,296 --> 01:47:11,431
so he could breathe.

1541
01:47:16,403 --> 01:47:18,672
And when I finally came back...

1542
01:47:20,607 --> 01:47:22,241
It's the sound he was making,

1543
01:47:22,309 --> 01:47:23,677
it's the noise
and the breathing.

1544
01:47:27,246 --> 01:47:28,849
He knew what was gonna happen.

1545
01:47:32,319 --> 01:47:33,653
[exhales heavily]

1546
01:47:38,425 --> 01:47:39,693
[Maren sniffles]

1547
01:47:44,164 --> 01:47:45,365
What did you do?

1548
01:47:48,335 --> 01:47:50,036
I ate him right the fuck up.

1549
01:47:52,239 --> 01:47:53,840
And it felt fucking great.

1550
01:47:55,408 --> 01:47:58,612
I felt high as a motherfucker.
[inhales sharply]

1551
01:48:11,358 --> 01:48:12,459
Probably would have
killed myself

1552
01:48:12,526 --> 01:48:13,660
if it weren't for Kayla.

1553
01:48:18,398 --> 01:48:19,466
I feel like I should have,
you know.

1554
01:48:19,533 --> 01:48:22,335
No. No, stop.

1555
01:48:23,170 --> 01:48:24,771
[Lee breathes heavily]

1556
01:48:25,906 --> 01:48:27,674
I would have done
the same thing.

1557
01:48:29,376 --> 01:48:31,011
I would have done
the same thing.

1558
01:48:31,077 --> 01:48:32,412
- Do you mean it?
- I would have done it in my way

1559
01:48:32,479 --> 01:48:33,613
but I would have done it.

1560
01:48:36,917 --> 01:48:39,052
You protected the people
that you love.

1561
01:48:45,292 --> 01:48:46,893
You don't think
I'm a bad person?

1562
01:48:53,667 --> 01:48:55,802
All I think is that I love you.

1563
01:49:00,106 --> 01:49:01,975
[Lee breathes shakily]

1564
01:49:09,549 --> 01:49:11,384
[Lee exhales deeply]

1565
01:49:13,553 --> 01:49:14,988
[Lee sniffles]

1566
01:49:16,456 --> 01:49:18,425
[Lee crying]

1567
01:49:51,191 --> 01:49:52,726
[Maren] Where do we go next?

1568
01:49:53,660 --> 01:49:54,828
[Lee] Anywhere.

1569
01:49:55,662 --> 01:49:57,365
[Maren] Let's drive back.

1570
01:49:57,464 --> 01:49:59,432
Until the truck
gives out somewhere.

1571
01:50:00,433 --> 01:50:03,036
And then just stay.

1572
01:50:04,104 --> 01:50:06,673
We can get a place, jobs.

1573
01:50:07,507 --> 01:50:09,409
You know, like people do.

1574
01:50:09,476 --> 01:50:12,479
[Lee] You wanna be people?
Let's be people.

1575
01:50:12,545 --> 01:50:15,548
[Maren] Yeah.
Let's be them for a while.

1576
01:50:21,187 --> 01:50:22,756
[Lee] Yeah,
we're in Ann Arbor now.

1577
01:50:23,456 --> 01:50:24,925
Ann Arbor.

1578
01:50:24,991 --> 01:50:26,793
Maren got a job
at the university,

1579
01:50:26,860 --> 01:50:28,795
at the bookstore,
so, we're right near campus.

1580
01:50:33,266 --> 01:50:34,434
What'd you say?

1581
01:50:36,703 --> 01:50:38,271
Yeah, maybe if
we're here long enough.

1582
01:50:38,339 --> 01:50:39,673
Hey, Kayla says hi.

1583
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:42,008
- Hi.
- Maren says hi.

1584
01:50:42,075 --> 01:50:44,010
- She wants to come up.
- Yeah.

1585
01:50:45,578 --> 01:50:47,580
[indistinct chatter]

1586
01:51:21,449 --> 01:51:23,049
[indistinct chatter]

1587
01:51:29,122 --> 01:51:31,825
Lee, I brought your...

1588
01:51:34,594 --> 01:51:35,762
[sighs]

1589
01:52:04,224 --> 01:52:05,692
[breathes deeply]

1590
01:52:09,529 --> 01:52:12,065
- [Maren whimpering]
- [shushing]

1591
01:52:20,474 --> 01:52:21,975
[Sully breathing heavily]

1592
01:52:22,042 --> 01:52:24,644
I'm gonna take my hand away,

1593
01:52:25,645 --> 01:52:27,314
and you're not gonna scream.

1594
01:52:28,315 --> 01:52:30,183
Because Sully's a friend

1595
01:52:31,551 --> 01:52:33,720
and we don't scream at friends.

1596
01:52:37,557 --> 01:52:38,958
[gasping]

1597
01:52:45,332 --> 01:52:48,168
Where's your...
Where's your cutie-pie?

1598
01:52:48,234 --> 01:52:49,702
[laughing]

1599
01:52:50,337 --> 01:52:52,138
I saw him.

1600
01:52:52,205 --> 01:52:56,310
I saw him walk out of here
half an hour ago.

1601
01:52:58,345 --> 01:52:59,313
I don't know.

1602
01:53:02,782 --> 01:53:04,818
What's all this for, Sully?

1603
01:53:09,523 --> 01:53:10,924
Ever...

1604
01:53:10,990 --> 01:53:14,027
Ever since I drove away
from you,

1605
01:53:14,894 --> 01:53:16,896
up there in Minnesota,

1606
01:53:18,365 --> 01:53:20,066
nothing's felt right.

1607
01:53:22,836 --> 01:53:24,637
[Maren] What does that mean?

1608
01:53:27,874 --> 01:53:29,042
[smacks lips]

1609
01:53:29,742 --> 01:53:30,877
It means...

1610
01:53:35,248 --> 01:53:37,283
[breathes heavily]

1611
01:53:37,351 --> 01:53:38,385
It means...

1612
01:53:40,787 --> 01:53:42,556
It mean... It...

1613
01:53:42,622 --> 01:53:46,893
It means unfinished business.

1614
01:53:52,600 --> 01:53:55,369
Sully, me and Lee...

1615
01:53:59,272 --> 01:54:00,240
we are together now.

1616
01:54:01,174 --> 01:54:02,775
[Maren gasps]

1617
01:54:02,842 --> 01:54:04,844
That's not the business
I'm talkin' about.

1618
01:54:13,286 --> 01:54:15,121
I don't mind.

1619
01:54:15,188 --> 01:54:18,858
I don't... I don't mind
if you don't like Sully.

1620
01:54:20,793 --> 01:54:25,865
What I mind is how much
you know about him

1621
01:54:25,932 --> 01:54:28,168
in that little head of yours.

1622
01:54:29,736 --> 01:54:32,205
You don't think
I'd tell anyone, right?

1623
01:54:32,272 --> 01:54:34,073
[Sully groans]

1624
01:54:34,140 --> 01:54:36,209
I mean, who would believe me?

1625
01:54:36,276 --> 01:54:37,344
[Sully groans]

1626
01:54:39,446 --> 01:54:43,917
And you're the one who told me
you don't kill any...

1627
01:54:45,018 --> 01:54:46,953
You don't kill, right?

1628
01:54:47,020 --> 01:54:48,355
You told me that, Sully.

1629
01:54:48,422 --> 01:54:50,156
You know, I told...

1630
01:54:50,223 --> 01:54:53,960
I used to try and tell people
the truth, you know.

1631
01:54:57,030 --> 01:54:59,132
They never took me serious.

1632
01:55:01,935 --> 01:55:03,269
[Sully sighs]

1633
01:55:07,675 --> 01:55:09,842
I just wanted to be...

1634
01:55:09,909 --> 01:55:13,179
I just wanted to be with
someone who understood.

1635
01:55:14,013 --> 01:55:15,215
Do you know what I mean?

1636
01:55:18,151 --> 01:55:19,085
Do you?

1637
01:55:20,086 --> 01:55:21,020
Mm.

1638
01:55:22,356 --> 01:55:23,357
Mm.

1639
01:55:24,257 --> 01:55:25,426
[sniffling]

1640
01:55:26,393 --> 01:55:27,361
Hmm.

1641
01:55:30,797 --> 01:55:32,065
[Sully grunts softly]

1642
01:55:32,899 --> 01:55:34,300
[door opens quietly]

1643
01:55:42,409 --> 01:55:43,410
[Maren] Hey.

1644
01:55:44,744 --> 01:55:46,313
You never get sick of yourself?

1645
01:55:53,953 --> 01:55:56,756
Sully just wants
to sleep at night.

1646
01:55:57,424 --> 01:55:58,425
That's all.

1647
01:56:01,662 --> 01:56:03,397
Sully just wants to sleep.

1648
01:56:04,931 --> 01:56:06,165
Sleep it off.

1649
01:56:07,501 --> 01:56:08,768
I said,

1650
01:56:09,737 --> 01:56:13,273
stop calling yourself Sully.

1651
01:56:13,340 --> 01:56:14,508
Shh!

1652
01:56:28,121 --> 01:56:30,123
[breathing heavily]

1653
01:56:30,990 --> 01:56:32,526
[screaming]

1654
01:56:34,728 --> 01:56:36,229
[Lee grunting]

1655
01:56:36,296 --> 01:56:37,864
[Sully yells]

1656
01:56:41,335 --> 01:56:43,337
[ALL GRUNTING]

1657
01:56:48,841 --> 01:56:51,345
[SULLY YELLING]

1658
01:56:54,847 --> 01:56:56,617
[GROANS]

1659
01:56:56,684 --> 01:56:58,452
Get off, Maren. Get off.

1660
01:56:59,852 --> 01:57:02,055
- [Maren grunting]
- [Sully groaning]

1661
01:57:08,995 --> 01:57:10,564
[Sully gasps deeply]

1662
01:57:21,742 --> 01:57:23,377
[Maren gasping]

1663
01:57:29,048 --> 01:57:30,451
[Lee grunting]

1664
01:57:34,755 --> 01:57:35,888
[Lee] Careful.

1665
01:57:36,590 --> 01:57:37,725
Come on.

1666
01:57:37,791 --> 01:57:39,258
[panting and grunting]

1667
01:57:43,930 --> 01:57:45,131
[sully groaning weakly]

1668
01:57:50,870 --> 01:57:52,105
Up.

1669
01:57:59,546 --> 01:58:01,214
[Sully groaning]

1670
01:58:04,083 --> 01:58:05,985
[Sully wheezing]

1671
01:58:07,821 --> 01:58:09,456
[panting]

1672
01:58:11,759 --> 01:58:14,293
[screaming in pain]

1673
01:58:16,830 --> 01:58:18,231
[gasping in pain]

1674
01:58:20,868 --> 01:58:23,069
[gasping deeply]

1675
01:58:31,911 --> 01:58:33,647
[Sully stops breathing]

1676
01:58:46,025 --> 01:58:48,060
[panting]

1677
01:58:54,735 --> 01:58:56,102
[panting]

1678
01:59:44,918 --> 01:59:46,453
[continues panting]

1679
01:59:48,054 --> 01:59:49,188
[grunting]

1680
02:00:13,747 --> 02:00:16,249
[Lee] That's the man you met,
the one who followed you?

1681
02:00:16,316 --> 02:00:18,050
I smelled him two blocks
from here.

1682
02:00:18,117 --> 02:00:19,353
How the fuck did he find you?

1683
02:00:20,687 --> 02:00:21,788
[Maren] Oh, no.

1684
02:00:24,290 --> 02:00:25,759
[Lee coughing]

1685
02:00:25,826 --> 02:00:27,093
[Lee gasping]

1686
02:00:36,302 --> 02:00:38,271
[Lee coughing]

1687
02:00:49,850 --> 02:00:50,984
[Maren] Hang on.

1688
02:00:51,050 --> 02:00:52,184
[breathing nervously]

1689
02:01:00,827 --> 02:01:02,996
Look. [whimpers]

1690
02:01:03,062 --> 02:01:04,865
Fuck, he hit your lung.

1691
02:01:04,932 --> 02:01:06,633
We gotta go to the ER.

1692
02:01:06,700 --> 02:01:09,135
Air is coming out of this.
I can see it.

1693
02:01:09,201 --> 02:01:10,337
He got Kayla.

1694
02:01:11,338 --> 02:01:12,973
He got Kayla.

1695
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:14,775
Don't think about that
right now.

1696
02:01:15,842 --> 02:01:17,578
[Lee] Fuck.

1697
02:01:17,644 --> 02:01:20,112
[Maren] Lee, we can't handle
this by ourselves, and...

1698
02:01:20,179 --> 02:01:21,682
- Am I bad?
- No.

1699
02:01:21,748 --> 02:01:24,051
No, no, Lee.
You're good, all right?

1700
02:01:24,116 --> 02:01:25,319
You're in shock.

1701
02:01:26,954 --> 02:01:28,655
- Am I bad?
- No.

1702
02:01:28,722 --> 02:01:30,156
No.

1703
02:01:30,222 --> 02:01:32,526
We can't call an ambulance, Lee.

1704
02:01:32,593 --> 02:01:34,628
We can't let anybody in here.

1705
02:01:35,462 --> 02:01:36,597
We're just gonna go.

1706
02:01:37,163 --> 02:01:38,665
Come on.

1707
02:01:38,732 --> 02:01:40,266
- I want you to eat first.
- Come on, Lee.

1708
02:01:40,834 --> 02:01:42,168
Come on.

1709
02:01:42,234 --> 02:01:43,904
- I want you to eat me.
- No.

1710
02:01:43,971 --> 02:01:45,706
- I want you to eat...
- I'm not gonna eat him.

1711
02:01:45,772 --> 02:01:47,106
- No. I want you to eat...
- I don't wanna.

1712
02:01:47,173 --> 02:01:48,240
I want you to eat me.

1713
02:01:48,308 --> 02:01:49,610
I want you to eat.

1714
02:01:49,676 --> 02:01:51,177
- I want you to feed.
- No.

1715
02:01:51,243 --> 02:01:53,112
- I want you to eat.
- No.

1716
02:01:53,179 --> 02:01:55,147
- I don't wanna. I can't. Stop.
- I want you to do it, Maren.

1717
02:01:55,214 --> 02:01:56,783
[Lee] I'm done here.
[Maren] No. No. No.

1718
02:01:56,850 --> 02:01:58,452
- I want you to do it, Maren.
- Lee, stop.

1719
02:01:58,518 --> 02:02:00,252
- No. No, I can't.
- Bones and all.

1720
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:01,955
- [Maren] I can't. Stop.
- [Lee coughs]

1721
02:02:02,022 --> 02:02:03,657
[Lee] It's beautiful.
[Maren] No. No. Stop.

1722
02:02:03,724 --> 02:02:05,525
Let me up. Let me up.
Let me up.

1723
02:02:05,592 --> 02:02:06,893
[Lee] It's the easiest thing,
Maren, love.

1724
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:08,194
[Maren] No. No. No.

1725
02:02:08,260 --> 02:02:09,396
[Lee] Just love me and eat.

1726
02:02:11,898 --> 02:02:13,567
[imperceptible]
