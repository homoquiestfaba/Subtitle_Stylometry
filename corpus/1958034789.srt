I went back to Mexico,

lay low for a little bit.

582
00:34:45,684 --> 00:34:47,118

583

had a chance.

after a two week recce in Iraq.

1245
01:05:40,971 --> 01:05:43,306
Been employed at the shop
ever since his return.

1246
01:05:43,307 --> 01:05:46,142
And most recently,
became the proud owner

1247
01:05:46,143 --> 01:05:48,878
of a new Roush Mustang.

1249
01:05:53,217 --> 01:05:56,319
What I wanna know is,
how does someone afford

1250
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,021
this car on minimum wage?

1251
01:05:58,022 --> 01:06:00,256
- Well, that's our position.
- SOLOMON: Mmhmm.

1252
01:06:00,257 --> 01:06:02,658
He'd also have knowledge
of weapons and tactics.

1253
01:06:02,659 --> 01:06:04,527
The plot thickens.

1254

SOLOMON: Hm.

1255
01:06:05,996 --> 01:06:07,230
Rader, what do we know
about him?

1256
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:09,698
Owns a local dive
outside of town.

1257
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:12,435
But get this, 25 years ago,

1258
01:06:12,436 --> 01:06:15,604
Rader was running organized
crime in Dallas County.

1259
01:06:15,605 --> 01:06:17,873
Has a jacket as long as my arm.

1260

And how does Wesley
track with Radar?

1263
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:27,183
Word on the street
is that he frequents his bar.

through Intelligence.

- SOLOMON: Okay.

1269

- JORDAN: Shop foreman.

1271
01:06:37,127 --> 01:06:39,028
JORDAN: Too many to track.

1272
01:06:39,029 --> 01:06:41,931
The shop employs mostly
Spanish speaking personnel.

01:06:43,733 --> 01:06:44,934

Wesley Russell now?

to a dance club.

What, strippers?

1277
01:06:51,941 --> 01:06:53,376
Could be washing the money.

1278
01:06:53,377 --> 01:06:55,445

Not a word.

what I was saying.

That's grunt work.

than minimum wage.

he's about to turn 16.

1315

My wife and I were about
to get him a new ride.

But, uh, you know,
they're not cheap.

And I noticed
that you got a new car.

1319
01:08:41,251 --> 01:08:42,685
So, I was just wondering,

1320
01:08:42,686 --> 01:08:44,820
how does someone afford
something like that

1321
01:08:44,821 --> 01:08:47,590

SOLOMON: Army left you
a hazard pay.

1325
01:08:52,896 --> 01:08:54,530
Of course, they probably left
you with some other things.

1326
01:08:54,531 --> 01:08:56,432
Right?

1327
01:08:56,433 --> 01:08:58,334
Weapons training?

1328

Hostage tactics?

1329
01:08:59,403 --> 01:09:02,206
Maybe, uh, a chip
on your shoulder?

1330
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,240
Where's this going?

1331
01:09:04,241 --> 01:09:06,342
Look, Mr. Russell,
explain to us...

1332
01:09:06,343 --> 01:09:08,111
How do you know Whitman Rader?

1333
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:11,880
You look like a nice lady.

1334
01:09:11,881 --> 01:09:13,849
Is this one of those moments
where I need a lawyer?

1335
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:15,184
SOLOMON: Well, well,
I don't know.

1336
01:09:15,185 --> 01:09:17,119
You know it's not a bad idea, right?

1337
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,622
But, usually,
in our line of work,

1338
01:09:19,623 --> 01:09:21,056
if somebody needs a lawyer,

1339
01:09:21,057 --> 01:09:23,025
uh, they have something
to hide so...

1340
01:09:23,026 --> 01:09:24,593
I don't know
a fucking Whitman Rader.

1341
01:09:24,594 --> 01:09:26,429
Okay. That's weird.

1342
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:29,398
That is weird though,
because the word on the street

1343
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:32,100
is you frequent his bar
quite a bit.

1344
01:09:32,101 --> 01:09:33,469
- Solomon.
- What? We're just talking.

01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:35,204
We're just talking here,
all right?

1346
01:09:35,205 --> 01:09:37,573
Just... just... just tell me
how you know the guy?

1347
01:09:37,574 --> 01:09:40,276
Yeah, and that's my cue,
I'll take uh,

1348
01:09:40,277 --> 01:09:41,877
a get-out-of-jail-free card.

1349
01:09:41,878 --> 01:09:43,246
I'll take that, uh, that lawyer.

I'll make you another deal.

Nothing, man.

about the bank?

got to Rader.

He's found shot dead
in his bar 15 minutes ago.

SOLOMON: Sheriff, what are you...
What are you talking about?

1776
01:37:58,006 --> 01:38:01,442
DAN: Any reason why the FBI
might be coordinating

1777
01:38:01,443 --> 01:38:04,912
with local PD on a bank job
behind my back?

1778
01:38:04,913 --> 01:38:07,681

1784
01:38:21,930 --> 01:38:25,132
Don't run an undercover bust
during my fucking investigation!

1785
01:38:25,133 --> 01:38:26,301
Prick!

1786
01:38:29,204 --> 01:38:30,238

Hey. We're closed.

Um, no, I'm actually
waiting on someone.

1796
01:41:19,707 --> 01:41:20,975
There's nobody here.

1797
01:41:23,345 --> 01:41:25,147
Okay. I'm sorry.
