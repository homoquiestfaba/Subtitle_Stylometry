1
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:55,821
Whoo-hoo!

2
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:04,129
Jake! Come on, jake!

3
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:06,432
Yeah, just a minute.

4
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:09,334
Come on!

5
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,905
Hi. I'm jake klein.

6
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:15,007
And I'm the writer and director
of this film.

7
00:01:15,009 --> 00:01:18,577
Although, when I'm not writing
and directing, which,

8
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,779
unfortunately,
is most of the time,

9
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:22,581
um...
i also sell real estate.

10
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:27,486
Ex-wife, couple of kids...
got to pay the bills.
anyway...

11
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:28,153
anyway...

12
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:30,756
anyway, I've written and
directed a few films that you

13
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:32,758
may or may not have heard of.

14
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,594
Uh... not exactly blockbusters,

15
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:38,263
but, you know, they...
they got around.

16
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,165
You can imdb me
and check them out.

17
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:45,204
So after my last film, I
was kind of hot for a heartbeat.

18
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:48,507
But eight years later,
still no film.

19
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,242
Came together... fell apart.

20
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:51,910
Money attached... fell apart.

21
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:53,512
Actors attached...
actors attached...

22
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:57,649
actors attached... fell apart.

23
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,718
Showbiz.

24
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:07,259
Finally, I couldn't take it
anymore.

25
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:09,828
Started spending more time
selling houses.

26
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:12,564
But I was dying creatively.

27
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:15,334
I just really needed
to make a film.

28
00:02:15,336 --> 00:02:20,606
Like you would paint
a painting or...

29
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:21,608
write a novel.

30
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:25,043
So I decided
since I got

31
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:28,847
this great house,
I'll use it myself, hm?

32
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:31,250
Fill it up with a lot of
interesting people...

33
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:32,851
ladies.

34
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:36,355
...shoot the heck out of it...

35
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:38,123
see what I get.

36
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,339
Hey. Jake.
Yeah?

37
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,208
Why don't you come over here
for a second?

38
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,443
I want you to introduce you
to the folks.

39
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:01,180
The folks?
Yeah.

40
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:04,983
Ladies and gentlemen, folks,

41
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:08,554
mike vogel is gonna
be playing me.

42
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:10,856
I'm playing him.

43
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:14,259
This is good.

44
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:17,129
This is... i mean... i...

45
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:19,398
it...

46
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,899
thanks, mike.

47
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:23,735
I mean, uh, jake.

48
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:28,473
Jake squared.

49
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:30,876
Get it?

50
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,644
Good. That's good.

51
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:36,281
It's a little different.
That was different.

52
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:38,383
I'll be back over here.

53
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,386
Got to keep him on his toes.

54
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,488
Pretty good-looking guy, huh?

55
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,923
But he's my pearl.

56
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:45,891
Jake!

57
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,060
Jake!

58
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:50,862
Come on in!

59
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,864
It's warm!

60
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,070
Uh, come on.

61
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:00,572
Come on.

62
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:05,043
Bet he never thought playing me
came with such perks.

63
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:10,382
Now, remember, this film
is about more than just sex.

64
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:12,718
It's about love.

65
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,187
'cause love is all there is.

66
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,390
Ooh! Hold on. Hold on.
Hold on.

67
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:19,658
Hold on. Hold on.

68
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:27,099
I'll... call her back.

69
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,673
Um... jake.

70
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:36,708
Yeah, boss?

71
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,609
I got this one.

72
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,710
You're kidding me, right?

73
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:44,750
Looks like this is one of
those times where I got to step
into the story.

74
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:45,617
How you girls doing?

75
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:49,087
Hey, jake? Jake?
Is somebody talking to me?

76
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:52,024
Jake. Okay,
this is bullshit.
there's a little fly.

77
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:54,359
No, no. We had a deal, okay?

78
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:56,395
Hey, have you paid attention
to contracts here?

79
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:59,164
We had an understanding here
for these type of scenes.

80
00:04:59,166 --> 00:04:59,698
Yeah, yeah.

81
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,600
If it's that hard, I'll walk.
I have no problem. What?

82
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:04,303
No, no. It's okay.
It's all right. It's all right.

83
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:05,237
It's good. It's good.
It's good.

84
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:09,308
Uh, I was getting, uh, a little
waterlogged anyway here.

85
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,943
Hm. Aw. mm.

86
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:19,084
Wha... uh, don't expect me
to be stepping out of the plot
anytime soon.

87
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:20,886
He's not great company, is he?

88
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:34,066
Aah!
What the hell are you doing?

89
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:37,002
Where am I?
better hurry up!
holy shit!

90
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,104
You're the one who's always
yelling and screaming about

91
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:40,906
missing the bus,
and now it's you.

92
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:42,140
Okay, so you guys go, go, go!

93
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:44,776
Go get some breakfast or
something.

94
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:45,377
I'm coming.

95
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,045
He said "coming."

96
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,514
shut up, you little freak!

97
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,086
Oh, um, by the way, you don't
need to be embarrassed.

98
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:58,490
I'm not a child, you know.
It's perfectly normal.

99
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:02,728
Yeah, me and viagra...
it's a terrible combination.

100
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:08,567
Actors, take note.

101
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:11,503
Never mess with your director.
All right?

102
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:14,206
I guess now we know who calls
the shots around here.

103
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,842
'cause I got to keep an eye on
everything.

104
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:17,642
It's my job.

105
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:22,881
And, lucky for me, there's an
app for that.

106
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:31,323
Aww.

107
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,094
Hey, sheryl.
Hey, jake.

108
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:36,828
Is this a good time?

109
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,766
Um... well, we're kind
of in the middle
of shooting.

110
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:43,101
Oh.
Sorry.

111
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:46,671
I guess you'll just call me when
you can?

112
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,940
Jake! We're waiting for you.

113
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:52,411
No, no.
we're, uh... you know,
this is okay.

114
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:53,912
I can talk for a second.

115
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,149
Yeah.

116
00:06:57,151 --> 00:06:58,049
What are you wearing?

117
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:00,118
Do you not have a shirt on?
Uh, no.

118
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,686
It's kind of like 100 degrees
here.

119
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:03,688
What's the weather like
in chicago?

120
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,690
Windy.

121
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:06,758
All right, let's roll.

122
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,594
Oh, sheryl, could you, uh,
hold on for a second?

123
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,997
I got to check
on what's going on.

124
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:13,532
Okay.

125
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:15,834
Driver!

126
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:17,002
Ye... no, no,
no, no, no.
I don't...

127
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:19,638
I don't know about that.
oh, come on, dad.
you know I'm doing great.

128
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,542
Okay, but you almost took
the side-view mirror off a prius
the other day.

129
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:25,811
But I didn't.

130
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:28,880
Okay. Okay.
I'm just kidding.

131
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:30,882
You're doing fine.
You can drive.

132
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:31,950
All right!

133
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,085
Shotgun. I called it.
Uh, no way.

134
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:36,455
Dad has to sit in the front
with me.

135
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:38,223
It's the law.

136
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,357
Jake!

137
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,092
When are you coming?

138
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:46,031
Oh, my god.
She said "coming," too.

139
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,299
Shut up, freak.

140
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:50,335
Jake!

141
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,705
Um... i just want to see you.

142
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:54,906
Yeah. Hold on. Hold on.

143
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:57,008
Let me just, uh,
put on this shirt.

144
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,844
No, I mean,
see you see you...

145
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:00,278
in person see you.

146
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:00,779
Ah. Hmm.

147
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:03,148
Well, I want to...
i want to see you, too.

148
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,350
It's been three months.

149
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:06,218
Yeah, I know.

150
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,819
It's been way too long.

151
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:08,386
Uh...

152
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:12,657
let me just, uh, work through
this and, uh, we'll figure
something out, okay?

153
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:13,325
I promise.

154
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,893
But listen, I got to get going.

155
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:19,364
No telling what's been going
on since I was away, okay?

156
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:20,366
Okay.

157
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,335
All right.

158
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:25,904
All right, let's see what's
going on here.

159
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:28,640
Sarah, can you please move
your seat forward?

160
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:29,941
I'm as far forward
as I can go.

161
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:31,676
My knees are rammed against
the back of the seat.

162
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,079
You're too far from the
wheel anyway.
move it up.

163
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:34,846
Oh, my god!
Move it up!

164
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,883
I'm practically going through
the windshield, dad.

165
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:38,416
Hey! Cut it out!

166
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:41,019
I can't.
I'm practically going through
the back of the seat.

167
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,521
Stop it!
Okay, okay!

168
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:42,921
That's enough!

169
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:44,723
That's it.
now I'm stepping
out of the scene.

170
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:47,392
But we're gonna be late for
the bus.
what...

171
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,561
see what you did?

172
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,199
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

173
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,101
What's he doing?

174
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:58,503
Okay, okay. Just relax.

175
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,972
Just relax. Relax.

176
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:04,142
And stepping in.

177
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:05,477
Just give him a sec.

178
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:07,312
It'll be interesting.

179
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:16,855
Ooh. I got an idea.

180
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,816
Oh, my god. Look at you.

181
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:47,686
Look at you!
What are you doing?

182
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:50,288
You are fucking pathetic.
You know that?

183
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,123
Now, I'm here,
looking for love

184
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,792
and a meaningful relationship.

185
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:57,562
All you're thinking about is
sex.

186
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:16,147
Excuse me, ladies.

187
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,516
One second.

188
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,296
Uh, did you see what I just
did there?

189
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:36,534
Talk about turning lemons into
lemonade... two versions of
myself, two jakes.

190
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:42,240
Now, not only is that cool, but
it's a great way of showing two

191
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:43,642
sides of a person's personality.

192
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:46,111
Anxious on one hand,
reluctant on the other.

193
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:49,581
Shy to a fault,
overconfident
at the same time.

194
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:52,250
Looking for love...

195
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,352
afraid to commit.

196
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:57,322
You get the point.

197
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:00,892
Dad, wake up!
Not now.

198
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:03,395
Come on!
We have to get to school!

199
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:05,597
Again?
Wake up!

200
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,899
Shit.

201
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:14,739
Rise and shh...

202
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:16,374
whoa.

203
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:19,010
Aw, no, no, no.
Now what?

204
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,912
That's not supposed to happen.

205
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,480
Dad?

206
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,382
Did you get a facelift?

207
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,586
That's not supposed to happen.

208
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,641
Ah. Finally.

209
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,912
So glad you're here.

210
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,085
Shit! Cut!

211
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:02,787
Cut, cut, cut, cut.

212
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,089
Okay.

213
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:07,425
What the fuck is going on here?

214
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:09,527
Now, this is not gonna work.

215
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,196
So much for lemonade.

216
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:13,064
One of you has got to go.

217
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:13,765
You.
I'm out.

218
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,967
No, no, no, no, no.
Me. Come on.

219
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:18,069
I'm f-freezing my ass off here.

220
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:22,474
All right, yeah.
W-w-w-whatever.

221
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,276
And who...
who's that woman with the...

222
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:27,445
in the blue-green dress
thing?

223
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:30,782
'cause I didn't...
i didn't hire her.

224
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:32,684
Where is she?

225
00:12:32,686 --> 00:12:35,520
You.
where the hell
did you come from?

226
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:36,221
Y-you got to go.

227
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,922
Y-you're gonna ruin my film.

228
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:38,623
I'm sorry.

229
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:39,991
I don't know what to say.

230
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:41,159
There's a lot at stake here.

231
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:44,429
You screw up my film,
I swear to god I'm gonna...

232
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,364
I'm... i'm...
i'm gonna kill you.

233
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:50,034
Probably not such
a good idea.

234
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:54,706
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.

235
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:56,474
Stepping out!

236
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,248
Okay, did you ever see the movie
"the sixth sense"?

237
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,617
But what if that's what's
happening to me?

238
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,986
What if I'm not even alive?

239
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:09,954
What if I'm fucking dead?

240
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,122
Dead?

241
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:15,493
And all this crazy shit is...
is really...

242
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:19,964
me in some kind of limbo?
Yeah.

243
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,600
And this whole party is a film.

244
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:24,803
It's really some kind of...

245
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:27,539
wake... for me.

246
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,542
How fucked up would that be?

247
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:45,890
That's
not a knife.

248
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:49,160
That's a knife.

249
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,763
Ow!

250
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,805
Just put it right there?
Yeah.

251
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,841
All right.
All right, all right.

252
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:07,278
Action!
Action.

253
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,446
W-w-what'd you do?

254
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,682
Uh, nothing.
I just, uh, just scraped it.

255
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:11,549
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

256
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:12,617
W-w-what are you making here?

257
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:15,453
Hot dog
wrapped in bacon.

258
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:17,956
Hello? Maybe
I'd like one.

259
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,357
Um, hello?

260
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,025
Maybe there were only two left.

261
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,894
Yeah.
Whatever.

262
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:23,828
You want me to...?

263
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,530
Get some silverware.

264
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:26,631
Yeah.

265
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,705
Mmm.

266
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,707
Tuna.

267
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,477
Some things never change.

268
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,813
May I have some, too?

269
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:47,452
Uh... yeah.

270
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,087
Sure, I guess.

271
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,389
Don't forget the chips.

272
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,391
The chips.

273
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,393
Right.

274
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,060
It's a...

275
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:56,895
it's a time-honored formula.

276
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:59,831
The kids tell me that's about
the only one he has.

277
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:03,968
So...

278
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,673
hmm.

279
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:56,487
So, there's this guy who's

280
00:15:56,489 --> 00:16:00,058
really struggling with his life.

281
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,727
He's always been
unlucky in love.

282
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:04,028
Is that
his fault?

283
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,130
Or is it just
the way things are?

284
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:09,667
He decides to make a movie
to help him sort it all out.

285
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:14,439
And the whole thing is supposed
to take place in this big party,

286
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:19,444
but things don't go exactly
according to plan.

287
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:21,512
Because not only is
he at the party,

288
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:25,583
but also himself at age 30,

289
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:28,586
as a teenager, and at 40.

290
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:30,521
And new loves are there, old

291
00:16:30,523 --> 00:16:34,359
loves are there,
and one love

292
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:39,030
he's known since he was a
teenager all the way till now.

293
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:42,600
Will she be his future as well
as his past?

294
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:47,605
Or will it be...
the new love?

295
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:52,443
Someone who lives really far
away and...

296
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,345
well, I mean, it's not
that far.

297
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:58,116
Or will it be his best friend,

298
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:01,753
someone he's known for 25 years?

299
00:17:01,755 --> 00:17:04,956
You know, where they know
everything there is to know

300
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,157
about each other and where

301
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:11,329
there's always been this
kind of... tension...

302
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,965
without any real action.

303
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:16,000
And you never know.

304
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:18,102
It could happen.

305
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:24,175
Or will it be what he so

306
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:26,544
strongly suspects... or I should

307
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:31,916
say fears...
that there'll be
no one?

308
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:34,519
Well, thank god there was never
a holy grail.

309
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:38,823
Or, at least,
that they never found one.

310
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:41,626
Because without the quest for

311
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:43,494
the grail, what would

312
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:46,330
sir galahad have done with the
rest of his life?

313
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:49,434
And without a never-ending quest

314
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:51,569
for a perfect love, would

315
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:55,173
jake klein even
be jake klein?

316
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,210
So, there you are.

317
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:45,423
Look at all that gray.

318
00:18:45,425 --> 00:18:46,991
What a difference 10 years

319
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:47,993
makes.

320
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:49,827
Holy shit.

321
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,165
I'm just kidding.

322
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:55,199
You look great.

323
00:18:58,271 --> 00:18:59,637
Oh. Oh, yeah?

324
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,639
Oh. Ohh. That's good.

325
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:02,673
Oh, oh, no.

326
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:06,744
Oh, oh! Oh, oh, oh!

327
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:13,251
Maybe I was wrong.

328
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,485
Yeah.

329
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:19,924
Maybe you turning up wasn't such
a bad idea after all.

330
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:21,692
Cocteau.

331
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,029
What the fuck did he know?

332
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,404
Aw, sorry.

333
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,139
I didn't, uh, I didn't realize

334
00:20:42,141 --> 00:20:42,940
anyone was there.

335
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:44,675
I-I didn't mean to intrude.

336
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:46,244
I just couldn't help myself.

337
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:47,945
You're really good.

338
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:49,580
Uh... i don't know.

339
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,849
No, really. You're great.

340
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:54,085
What's your name?

341
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,289
Uh... i'm damian.

342
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:01,525
Well, that's a cool name.
I'm rain.

343
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:03,794
Wow... rain.

344
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:06,230
That's actually a lot cooler.

345
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:12,236
So, damian, are you gonna
play me a song?

346
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:13,104
Uh, yeah.

347
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:16,140
I'm gonna
write you a song.

348
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,314
Boss, where do you want that
shot set up?

349
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:59,183
Do you want that shot by the
pool outside or do you want it

350
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:00,384
over there, out in the front?

351
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:01,752
Excuse me. What?
Oh, man.

352
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:05,222
Oh, man, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I thought you were jake.

353
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:06,924
I am.

354
00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:09,126
What?
You guys got the same name?

355
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:09,660
Look at you, man.

356
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:10,461
You even
look like him.

357
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:13,798
Maybe if he was like a...
like a few decades
younger or something.

358
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,133
Hey, don't tell him I said that,
though.

359
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:19,003
I won't. I won't.

360
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:28,979
So, tateleh,
how's everything going?

361
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:30,147
Great, grandpa.

362
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:31,816
I met an incredible girl.

363
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:33,684
Wonderful. What's her name?

364
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,753
Rain.
What kind of name is that?

365
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:38,856
Well, no, it's a... i-it's
more like a nickname.

366
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:42,093
Her real name's joanne cohen.
Joanne cohen?

367
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:42,760
Joanne cohen?!

368
00:22:42,762 --> 00:22:44,829
No, no. Don't touch that girl.

369
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:45,162
What?

370
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:46,931
I think she might be your
cousin.

371
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:49,166
Don't do anything till I call
you back.

372
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:50,701
Wait, but, grandpa, wa...

373
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,077
roses are red.

374
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,779
Violets are blue.

375
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:37,481
I feel like an egotistical

376
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:39,150
piece of shit.

377
00:23:39,152 --> 00:23:41,752
How about you?

378
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:49,059
With all the death and poverty
and hatred in the world, people

379
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:52,163
enslaving and torturing each
other, what the hell is the

380
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:56,066
relevance of a self-indulgent
piece of shit like this?

381
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:57,168
One.

382
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,669
How can anyone care about the

383
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:00,104
love-life musings of one guy who

384
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:01,639
may or may not be afraid that

385
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:02,506
he's going to wind up alone,

386
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:06,677
with people being slaughtered
all over the world?

387
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:08,712
Two.

388
00:24:08,714 --> 00:24:11,582
Skinheads want to kill jews and
blacks and hispanics.

389
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:14,185
Some people want to deny the
poorest children healthcare and

390
00:24:14,187 --> 00:24:17,354
nutrition so the richest people
won't have to pay a few thousand

391
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:18,956
more each year in taxes.

392
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:23,694
The lack of morality is so
disheartening.

393
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:24,528
Shit.

394
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:27,231
Things are no different than
they were 3,000 years ago.

395
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:29,200
All the advances don't make a
bit of difference.

396
00:24:29,202 --> 00:24:31,669
We may be able to text each
other, but all the evils that

397
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:35,539
existed at the beginning of
mankind still exist today!

398
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,049
9, 10.

399
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:09,840
Grandpa?

400
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,275
You're dead. You're dead.

401
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:12,343
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

402
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:15,646
Tateleh, you're confused.

403
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,416
Uh...

404
00:25:19,418 --> 00:25:22,152
yeah... confused.

405
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:26,056
Jakey, each one of us is alive

406
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:28,626
in our own time and place.

407
00:25:28,628 --> 00:25:30,294
And each one of us has to deal

408
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:31,962
with the same problems that

409
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:33,998
humans have dealt with since the

410
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,165
beginning of our time.

411
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:36,400
Now, none of the problems that

412
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:40,037
you're thinking of have been
solved yet.

413
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,439
We tried, but, uh...

414
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:45,509
still they remain,
essentially the same.

415
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:47,311
Son.

416
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:49,613
Dad.

417
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:53,918
The problems of the world are
huge.

418
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:58,355
No one of us can solve them all.

419
00:25:58,357 --> 00:26:00,524
M-mostly busy with our own daily

420
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:07,197
lives, so we try our best
to solve the large ones.

421
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:09,800
But we leave them to the leaders

422
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:10,935
and great thinkers...

423
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:13,437
the ones we've delegated the
responsibility to.

424
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15,839
And they haven't had much luck,
by the way.

425
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:18,342
I feel like I'm at a seder.
What is this...

426
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:20,611
the responsive-reading part?

427
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:21,378
Do you mind?

428
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,280
No, not at all.
No.

429
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,351
So, you see, jake, that's the
answer to your question.

430
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:30,554
That's what makes your movie
relevant and not self-indulgent.

431
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:33,657
We need to hear about people's
relationship struggles.

432
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:36,026
We need to hear about their
career issues.

433
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:39,496
What other yardsticks
do we have?

434
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,969
Which means...?

435
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:48,872
It can't all be about serving
the larger cause.

436
00:26:48,874 --> 00:26:50,307
The immediate and more temporal

437
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:55,379
must be served, as well, and
perhaps, even first.

438
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:56,880
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

439
00:26:56,882 --> 00:27:00,851
And then there are the
mother teresas of the world.

440
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:01,853
Thank god we have them.

441
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:04,655
They're here to deal with the
other stuff.

442
00:27:04,657 --> 00:27:07,057
With a little help from us,
of course...

443
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:10,127
when we're not too
busy worrying about our love

444
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:14,331
lives and our mortgages,
that is.

445
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:17,868
What about you?
Do you have anything to say?

446
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,137
Yeah.

447
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,171
Go ahead.

448
00:27:22,742 --> 00:27:24,875
You're cute.

449
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:27,344
You know, I like that.

450
00:27:27,346 --> 00:27:28,412
I like that.

451
00:27:28,414 --> 00:27:30,914
Feeling better now?

452
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:31,949
Yeah.

453
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:34,351
I'm feeling much better now.

454
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:04,982
Jakey! Jakey!

455
00:28:04,984 --> 00:28:06,083
I almost forgot to tell you...

456
00:28:06,085 --> 00:28:07,751
geez, grandpa, I told you...

457
00:28:07,753 --> 00:28:08,852
it's "damian."

458
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:09,653
damian.

459
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:10,788
Of course,
tateleh.

460
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,423
So, how long is that gonna last?

461
00:28:12,425 --> 00:28:13,991
Quit stalling. Just...

462
00:28:13,993 --> 00:28:14,958
what'd you find out?

463
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,560
I checked it out, and it's

464
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:17,528
just what I thought.

465
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,563
She's your cousin, all right.

466
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:20,030
Shit!

467
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,266
Second cousin once removed.

468
00:28:22,268 --> 00:28:24,268
W-wait. W-what's that mean?

469
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:27,037
That means it's okay...
strictly kosher.

470
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,474
Wait... seriously?
Seriously.

471
00:28:30,476 --> 00:28:32,943
All right!

472
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,953
A little odd, maybe.

473
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,334
Oh.

474
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:05,836
I remember that song.

475
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:07,204
Oh, I'm sorry.

476
00:30:07,206 --> 00:30:07,671
I didn't...

477
00:30:07,673 --> 00:30:09,039
I didn't realize anyone
was there.

478
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:15,145
That's exactly what you said
that night, and it wasn't true
then, either.

479
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:20,250
It is you,
isn't it, rain?

480
00:30:20,252 --> 00:30:20,717
Of course.

481
00:30:20,719 --> 00:30:26,456
Although, I haven't used that
name in... several decades.

482
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:30,360
Damian.

483
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:33,363
I remember everything.

484
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:35,599
I remember what
you wore, what I wore.

485
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:39,736
What you said,
what I said.

486
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:44,775
I was so in love with you.

487
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:48,612
I didn't know.

488
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:50,714
How could you not know?

489
00:30:50,716 --> 00:30:53,750
So insecure.

490
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:56,720
Guess I still am.

491
00:30:56,722 --> 00:31:00,357
Didn't need to be.

492
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:03,760
You were my dream come true.

493
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,741
You were mine.

494
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:24,147
I think.

495
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:35,726
Wake up! You overslept again!

496
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,750
Morning, sleepyhead.

497
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:02,252
Better hurry up, or you're gonna
miss the bus.

498
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:05,088
Yeah, like I care.
Unless I drop you off.

499
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,257
It's out of my way, but for you,
sonny boy...

500
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,659
driver.
Oh. Sorry I asked.

501
00:32:08,661 --> 00:32:10,661
Come on!
Dad, you know I'm doing great.

502
00:32:10,663 --> 00:32:12,129
You nearly took the side-view

503
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:13,497
mirror off a lincoln yesterday!

504
00:32:13,499 --> 00:32:15,933
Yeah, but...
but I didn't.

505
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:18,635
You're doing fine.

506
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:20,437
Okay. You can drive.

507
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,406
All right!

508
00:32:22,408 --> 00:32:23,674
Uh, mom, I'm gonna need to have

509
00:32:23,676 --> 00:32:25,242
a cup of coffee... black,
please.

510
00:32:25,244 --> 00:32:27,711
You know I don't like you
drinking coffee.

511
00:32:27,713 --> 00:32:28,946
It gets you all wound up.

512
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:29,780
Don't worry, ma.

513
00:32:29,782 --> 00:32:31,181
I'm not gonna get wound up.

514
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:33,517
It's just, I'm half asleep.

515
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:34,384
I got to drive.

516
00:32:34,386 --> 00:32:37,287
All right. Just one cup.

517
00:32:42,761 --> 00:32:44,795
What is that?

518
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:47,465
I don't know.

519
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:48,699
I'll go check it out.

520
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:18,028
Excuse me.

521
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:29,940
Mom.

522
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:36,446
Mom.

523
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:39,783
Oh. Hello.

524
00:33:39,785 --> 00:33:42,986
Um, do you know me?

525
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:45,989
Of course I know you.

526
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:46,923
Who am I?

527
00:33:46,925 --> 00:33:47,691
Don't be ridiculous.

528
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:51,628
What mother wouldn't know her
own son?

529
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:56,066
Look at you.

530
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:00,804
You're so young, so beautiful.

531
00:34:00,806 --> 00:34:04,508
Thank you, sweetheart.

532
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,276
Look at me.

533
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:08,712
You look wonderful.

534
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:14,484
"wonderful."

535
00:34:14,486 --> 00:34:16,720
I'm at least 10 years
older than you.

536
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:17,687
How is that possible?

537
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:19,956
Jakey, you seem stressed.

538
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:21,425
Do you want a cup of coffee?

539
00:34:21,427 --> 00:34:23,560
I thought you didn't like me
having coffee.

540
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,996
Well, sweetheart, you're not
exactly 17 anymore.

541
00:34:25,998 --> 00:34:29,900
I think we can make an
exception this one time.

542
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:32,235
Okay?
Yeah.

543
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:45,415
I don't get it.

544
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:49,052
H-how did you and dad do it?

545
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:50,654
Married 55 years.

546
00:34:50,656 --> 00:34:51,421
55 years?

547
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,422
Well, a-at least, that's how

548
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:55,992
long you
will be married
before dad...

549
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,329
w... i mean,
what I'm trying

550
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:01,064
to say is,
no matter how hard I

551
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:03,567
try, I can't seem to do what you

552
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:06,670
and dad did, so...

553
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:08,238
effortlessly.

554
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,440
Maybe you're trying too hard,
jakey.

555
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:14,978
Your father and I were very
lucky... a miracle.

556
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,849
He never thought that he was
gonna make a relationship work.

557
00:35:18,851 --> 00:35:23,420
And then we fell in love at
first sight, and there was never

558
00:35:23,422 --> 00:35:25,522
any need to look anywhere else.

559
00:35:25,524 --> 00:35:27,791
That's great.
That's great.

560
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:29,459
Don't worry.

561
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:32,562
You'll know when the right one
comes along.

562
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:34,631
Well, I
thought I did.

563
00:35:35,033 --> 00:35:37,367
I thought jocelyn was the one,
but I was wrong.

564
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:39,136
Love at first sight is
wonderful.

565
00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:41,271
But then it takes a lot of

566
00:35:41,273 --> 00:35:44,040
work to make a real
relationship.

567
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:47,277
Maybe it wasn't so effortless as
you think.

568
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:49,246
Your father wasn't the easiest
of men.

569
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:52,582
He could be...
very difficult at times.

570
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:55,385
Well, mom...

571
00:35:55,387 --> 00:35:59,156
I don't think it's gonna happen
for me.

572
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:03,059
But it's all I ever wanted...

573
00:36:03,061 --> 00:36:05,896
what you and dad had.

574
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:10,734
I'm not even capable of...

575
00:36:10,736 --> 00:36:14,104
what?
You were 20 when you met dad?

576
00:36:14,106 --> 00:36:15,639
I'm not 20.

577
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:17,974
I'm not even 40.

578
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:23,580
Problem is I've had

579
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:26,917
too many right ones come along.

580
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:29,019
Oh, my god.

581
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:31,154
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

582
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:32,589
Jakey.

583
00:36:32,591 --> 00:36:34,791
I feel so
bad.

584
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:37,260
I want to see you have
everything you want.

585
00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:39,262
And I hate seeing you
sad like this.

586
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:40,830
No, no, ma.
Cut it out. Please.

587
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:44,301
Look, everything's fine.
Everything's fine.

588
00:36:44,303 --> 00:36:46,303
Please... don't worry.
I'm fine.

589
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:48,305
"don't worry, ma."
"don't worry, ma."

590
00:36:48,307 --> 00:36:50,473
that's what you always say.
I can't help but worry.

591
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:51,975
I'm just having a moment.
That's it.

592
00:36:51,977 --> 00:36:54,177
Everybody's entitled
to a moment.

593
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:54,644
It's good.

594
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:56,313
It's all right,
you know?

595
00:36:56,315 --> 00:37:01,785
I mean, I got two beautiful
kids, got a beautiful life.

596
00:37:02,955 --> 00:37:05,255
Not to mention a beautiful
mother.

597
00:37:05,257 --> 00:37:10,060
So don't worry...
please. Okay.

598
00:37:10,696 --> 00:37:13,029
I'm gonna have another cup
of coffee.

599
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:13,630
One cup.

600
00:37:13,632 --> 00:37:16,266
I don't want you getting all
wound up... again.

601
00:37:16,268 --> 00:37:19,736
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Don't worry.

602
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:21,004
All right? Don't worry.

603
00:37:21,006 --> 00:37:23,907
Don't you worry.

604
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:37,153
You are so lucky.

605
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:38,521
You're telling me.

606
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:40,757
No, seriously.

607
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:43,593
You are lucky to be jewish.

608
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,497
Really?

609
00:37:47,499 --> 00:37:48,665
Yeah.

610
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:50,600
I really admire the jewish
people.

611
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:54,104
I've even thought about
converting.

612
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:57,307
Very cool.
Very cool.

613
00:37:57,309 --> 00:38:00,644
I mean,
you people are amazing...

614
00:38:00,646 --> 00:38:03,680
so smart and successful.

615
00:38:03,682 --> 00:38:06,449
I mean,
jews pretty much control
everything.

616
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:11,554
Especially in show business,
and I'm an actress,
you know,

617
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:15,158
so, that's very important
to me.

618
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,926
So you think by converting,

619
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:20,230
you'll kind of get in on that?

620
00:38:20,232 --> 00:38:22,032
Yeah.

621
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,467
So right after the ceremony,

622
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:25,201
you'll get a call from the

623
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:30,974
central jew committee,
asking where
to send your share?

624
00:38:33,378 --> 00:38:35,412
No.

625
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:40,183
Well, I guess.

626
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,792
I got to go.

627
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:53,496
Damn it.

628
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:57,901
Damn it. Damn it.

629
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,584
Well, at least
I almost got laid.

630
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:16,086
Yeah, well... you didn't.

631
00:39:16,088 --> 00:39:17,721
Long story.

632
00:39:17,723 --> 00:39:19,622
Mm. Always is.

633
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,559
What's
your excuse?

634
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:24,260
What are you waiting for?

635
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:25,128
Yeah?

636
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,429
I'm, uh...

637
00:39:26,431 --> 00:39:26,963
I'm working it.

638
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:28,965
We got a...
we got a thing going

639
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:29,366
on over here.

640
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:32,635
Just waiting for the right
moment.

641
00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:39,175
Ladies, how are we?

642
00:39:39,177 --> 00:39:40,410
Fine.

643
00:39:40,412 --> 00:39:41,344
I'm jake.

644
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:43,680
Uh, jake, I'm laurie.

645
00:39:43,682 --> 00:39:46,383
Laurie. That is beautiful.

646
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:49,052
Do you like hot tubs?

647
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:50,754
N...

648
00:39:50,756 --> 00:39:52,889
doesn't everybody?

649
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:53,957
Yeah.

650
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:56,025
Shall we?

651
00:40:02,134 --> 00:40:03,233
Nnngh!

652
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:05,001
Unngh!

653
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,232
Doomed.

654
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:39,369
So fucking doomed.

655
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:40,456
I'll call her tomorrow.

656
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:03,279
So, I don't get it.

657
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:07,450
If you really like sheryl,
why don't you get her
to move here?

658
00:43:07,452 --> 00:43:08,885
She's a fabulous woman, and,

659
00:43:08,887 --> 00:43:10,553
surprisingly enough,
she likes
you.

660
00:43:10,555 --> 00:43:14,157
Oh. Thank you. Thank you.
You're welcome.

661
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:16,626
Hey, boss.
We're ready when you are.

662
00:43:16,628 --> 00:43:19,095
Uh, we'll...
we'll be right there.

663
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,497
Come on. Got to get going.

664
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,200
I don't know, beth.

665
00:43:24,202 --> 00:43:26,836
Just doesn't seem fair somehow,
you know?

666
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:29,639
I mean, she lives halfway across
the country.

667
00:43:29,641 --> 00:43:32,809
She's got a small kid.
You know, I live here.

668
00:43:32,811 --> 00:43:34,711
I got two kids.
W-w-what?

669
00:43:34,713 --> 00:43:37,680
What am I supposed to do...
move her and her kid here?

670
00:43:37,682 --> 00:43:39,682
I mean, that'll screw
up their lives...

671
00:43:39,684 --> 00:43:44,387
take them away from all
their friends, school.

672
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:45,655
Not to mention the kid's dad.

673
00:43:45,657 --> 00:43:50,126
I mean, I don't know how
I'd feel if somebody
did that to me,

674
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:51,995
you know?
I mean...

675
00:43:52,497 --> 00:43:57,300
and then, after all that, you
find out, hey, it doesn't work.

676
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:59,602
That... that...
that'd be awful.

677
00:43:59,604 --> 00:44:01,304
Then why don't you...

678
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:02,939
you could move
there.

679
00:44:02,941 --> 00:44:04,407
No. You kidding me?

680
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:06,476
Man, I got an ex-wife...

681
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:07,410
joint custody.

682
00:44:07,412 --> 00:44:10,647
You know, so I think she'll have
something to say about that.

683
00:44:10,649 --> 00:44:15,184
Not to mention, you know how
cold it is in chicago?

684
00:44:15,186 --> 00:44:16,186
Hmm.

685
00:44:16,187 --> 00:44:18,221
What?
What's that supposed to mean?

686
00:44:18,223 --> 00:44:19,423
Oh, nothing. Just "hmm."

687
00:44:19,424 --> 00:44:21,124
I don't think I like the
sound of that "hmm."

688
00:44:21,126 --> 00:44:25,695
well, then,
you're too sensitive.

689
00:44:25,697 --> 00:44:27,230
You know...

690
00:44:27,232 --> 00:44:27,830
I don't know.

691
00:44:27,832 --> 00:44:29,899
I just think that these sound

692
00:44:29,901 --> 00:44:33,002
like really good excuses for not
pulling the trigger yet again.

693
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:34,537
No. Look, come on.
Give me a break.

694
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:37,040
I mean, look, look.
If she lived here and, you know,

695
00:44:37,042 --> 00:44:39,042
had a life, was raising her kid

696
00:44:39,044 --> 00:44:41,611
here, you know, then... t-then

697
00:44:41,613 --> 00:44:43,613
anything's possible.
You know what I mean?

698
00:44:43,615 --> 00:44:45,015
We could see each other
normal-like.

699
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:47,450
But you would still find
something wrong.

700
00:44:47,452 --> 00:44:49,886
'cause you'd search and you'd,
you know, you'd get all

701
00:44:49,888 --> 00:44:52,455
intellectual about it and in
your head about it.

702
00:44:52,457 --> 00:44:53,623
If you were really in love,

703
00:44:53,625 --> 00:44:54,590
you would figure
out a way to make
it work.

704
00:44:54,592 --> 00:44:59,328
What makes you think that she
would even want to do anything
like that, anyway?

705
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:02,432
Wha...
all right, you guys ready?

706
00:45:02,434 --> 00:45:04,367
Yeah. Almost there.

707
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:06,502
All right. 10-4.

708
00:45:06,504 --> 00:45:07,970
"10-4"?

709
00:45:07,972 --> 00:45:09,772
You're not a cop.

710
00:45:09,774 --> 00:45:10,173
"10-4. 10-4."

711
00:45:10,175 --> 00:45:12,141
what else...
what should I say?

712
00:45:12,143 --> 00:45:13,376
Like, "over and out," or what?

713
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:16,179
So, have you... i mean, do
you know how many that you...

714
00:45:16,181 --> 00:45:18,448
you're working on this thing?
No, I don't.

715
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:18,948
They didn't tell me.

716
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,817
Whoa. W-what is that?
What is this?

717
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:22,919
Wig.
no, I don't...
i don't do wigs.

718
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:25,321
No wigs?
No, it's contractual.

719
00:45:25,323 --> 00:45:26,222
Take it up with jake.

720
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:28,925
So, what happened with the
other thing?

721
00:45:28,927 --> 00:45:33,162
Oh, my god.
The... the internet thingy?

722
00:45:33,164 --> 00:45:35,298
Ah, it's a total bust.

723
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:35,732
Oh, no! Why?

724
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:39,535
I went one of the worst
dinners of my life.

725
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:40,870
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yeah.

726
00:45:40,872 --> 00:45:44,107
Why? What happened?
Major attitude, major

727
00:45:44,109 --> 00:45:46,509
appetite, major nose job.

728
00:45:46,511 --> 00:45:48,377
No!
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

729
00:45:48,379 --> 00:45:52,315
I mean, she told me she was
slender.

730
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:55,017
And she wasn't?

731
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:57,019
Not if you consider 5'7" and

732
00:45:57,021 --> 00:45:57,854
150 pounds slender.

733
00:45:57,856 --> 00:46:02,191
That's... that... that's a
very nice figure.

734
00:46:03,227 --> 00:46:04,560
That kind of
is slender,

735
00:46:04,562 --> 00:46:06,763
actually, if you think about it.

736
00:46:07,332 --> 00:46:09,165
I'm awful.
Yes, you're awful.

737
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:10,967
I'm awful!
Very superficial.

738
00:46:10,969 --> 00:46:12,535
Okay, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

739
00:46:12,537 --> 00:46:15,171
You didn't tell me about that
date you went on.

740
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:16,305
How'd that go?
Ohhh!

741
00:46:16,307 --> 00:46:18,975
No, no. How...
how di...
what?

742
00:46:18,977 --> 00:46:21,344
Okay, well, you know how when
people are...

743
00:46:21,346 --> 00:46:23,746
yeah.
...single and they just want

744
00:46:23,748 --> 00:46:24,480
to be in a relationship?

745
00:46:24,482 --> 00:46:28,951
And then, once you're with
someone, you just feel like...

746
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:30,019
trapped.

747
00:46:30,021 --> 00:46:32,088
Ah. Okay.
I got it.

748
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:35,024
So he wasn't... he didn't have,
um... he wasn't spiritual.

749
00:46:35,026 --> 00:46:37,326
Oh, god!
Don't do that to me.

750
00:46:37,328 --> 00:46:39,295
He just, you know, didn't
have much to say.

751
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:42,598
You're changing the subject,
and we're supposed to talk about

752
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,533
how fucked up
you are.

753
00:46:43,535 --> 00:46:44,967
On the next film, we can talk

754
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:46,035
about how fucked up
I am.

755
00:46:46,037 --> 00:46:47,370
Okay.
Okay?

756
00:46:47,372 --> 00:46:49,205
Okay, all right.
We'll do that.

757
00:46:49,207 --> 00:46:50,039
You can't?

758
00:46:50,041 --> 00:46:52,942
No, but I could talk to him.
I could see if I could get you,

759
00:46:52,944 --> 00:46:54,844
like, another, uh, another scene
or something.

760
00:46:54,846 --> 00:46:56,946
We have great hot tubs,
great, great party scenes.

761
00:46:56,948 --> 00:47:01,717
Oh, yeah. That'd be great.
Scene 55, take 4.

762
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:02,785
All right, uh...

763
00:47:02,787 --> 00:47:03,319
get your water.

764
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:06,055
Let's see the evamor
bottle... bottles.

765
00:47:06,057 --> 00:47:07,356
Yep.
All right.

766
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:09,859
This is shameless.

767
00:47:09,861 --> 00:47:10,726
Okay, boss.

768
00:47:10,728 --> 00:47:13,229
We're ready down here.

769
00:47:13,231 --> 00:47:16,699
All right, action!

770
00:47:16,701 --> 00:47:18,434
Is that "action"?

771
00:47:18,436 --> 00:47:19,035
Action.

772
00:47:19,037 --> 00:47:21,137
I'm telling you, she... she

773
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:24,307
is the most beautiful, you know,

774
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:27,543
funny, loving, supportive girl

775
00:47:27,545 --> 00:47:29,679
that I-i've met in my entire
life.

776
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:31,214
I can't wait to meet her.

777
00:47:31,216 --> 00:47:34,350
Yeah, beth, I'm telling you,
you're gonna love her.

778
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:35,151
Boom!
But...

779
00:47:35,153 --> 00:47:37,286
"but" what? What?

780
00:47:37,288 --> 00:47:38,788
"but" what?
Oh, come on.

781
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:41,457
You know, what's the "but"?
No, there's no "but."

782
00:47:41,459 --> 00:47:43,025
she's fabulous.
No, no.

783
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:43,659
There is
always a "but."

784
00:47:43,661 --> 00:47:45,528
yeah, no, and that's what I
thought, too, right?

785
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:48,631
I thought that there's no way
that I could ever fall in love,
right?

786
00:47:48,633 --> 00:47:51,367
It's not because I hadn't met
the right one yet, you know what
I mean?

787
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:55,438
Uh... but... but... but it's
because there couldn't possibly
be...

788
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,406
in the frame!

789
00:47:57,408 --> 00:47:58,207
...there couldn't possibly...

790
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:01,177
be a right one, you know
what I mean?
because of me.

791
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:03,379
I have to admit, that thought
did cross my mind.

792
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:04,580
Right.
so if you take...
like, if you

793
00:48:04,582 --> 00:48:09,752
take the girl that I... that I
cared about least in my life,
you know?

794
00:48:09,754 --> 00:48:10,620
Mm.
Um...

795
00:48:10,622 --> 00:48:15,024
sandy.
What's the line?

796
00:48:15,026 --> 00:48:15,558
"in my life."

797
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,093
we'll take it again. Hold on.

798
00:48:17,095 --> 00:48:17,793
So if you take the girl that

799
00:48:17,795 --> 00:48:21,497
I've cared about least in my
life with the girl that I cared

800
00:48:21,499 --> 00:48:23,099
about the most in my life,

801
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:23,966
right, and you put them on a

802
00:48:23,968 --> 00:48:27,637
scale from here to here,
jocelyn is like...
she's... she's...

803
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:32,241
pyew!
I mean, she's on the other side
of that canyon, you know?

804
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:34,710
I'm telling you, this girl,
she's off the charts.

805
00:48:34,712 --> 00:48:36,946
She is the one.

806
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,853
Jake?
Jake!

807
00:48:43,855 --> 00:48:48,724
I think this is when you're
supposed to say, "cut."

808
00:48:48,726 --> 00:48:49,959
hmm?
"cut."

809
00:48:49,961 --> 00:48:51,394
oh.

810
00:48:51,396 --> 00:48:53,429
Cut!

811
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:54,463
Thanks.

812
00:48:54,465 --> 00:48:55,031
Camera cuts.

813
00:48:55,033 --> 00:48:57,199
Anyway, I'll talk to him.
I'll see if we can't, uh...

814
00:48:57,201 --> 00:49:00,436
yeah, do that. Yeah.
...get another scene
or something.

815
00:49:01,406 --> 00:49:03,406
She's cute.

816
00:49:03,408 --> 00:49:06,842
You really think she looks
like me?

817
00:49:06,844 --> 00:49:10,613
Nah, you're significantly
better-looking.

818
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:13,783
All right, let's do it again.

819
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:21,557
You're a taskmaster.

820
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:30,599
After you, my love.

821
00:49:31,703 --> 00:49:33,069
Careful. Careful.

822
00:49:34,439 --> 00:49:35,705
Welcome home!

823
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,374
Mom. Dad.
What are you doing here?

824
00:49:38,376 --> 00:49:41,377
Oh, welcome home.
You didn't think we'd miss

825
00:49:41,379 --> 00:49:42,445
the birth of our first

826
00:49:42,447 --> 00:49:43,746
grandchild, did you?

827
00:49:43,748 --> 00:49:45,581
So darling.

828
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:51,387
Oh, hello, there, little...
sarah. We named her sarah.

829
00:49:51,389 --> 00:49:55,491
You named her after my
mother.

830
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:56,359
Aw.

831
00:49:56,361 --> 00:49:58,995
I don't know what to say.

832
00:49:58,997 --> 00:49:59,528
Aw.

833
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:03,833
Probably the happiest day
of my life.

834
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:09,405
That guy doesn't look
anything like me.

835
00:50:09,407 --> 00:50:11,173
It doesn't have to look
exactly like you.

836
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:14,310
I mean, it... it... it... it's
just an artistic interpretation.

837
00:50:14,312 --> 00:50:17,546
Well, how come your
interpretation looks like
brad pitt?

838
00:50:17,548 --> 00:50:20,516
My guy looks like
james cromwell.

839
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:25,521
Here.
You want to see her?

840
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:26,389
I got her.
Oh.

841
00:50:26,391 --> 00:50:28,824
Just c-careful.
Just ca... be careful.

842
00:50:28,826 --> 00:50:30,960
What up, fake dad?

843
00:50:30,962 --> 00:50:34,363
Hey, fake dad.

844
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:35,598
What? Who's that?

845
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:45,408
Hello?

846
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:49,045
Mike. Hi. Jake.
Listen, you got to help me.

847
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:50,980
Okay. What's up, man?

848
00:50:50,982 --> 00:50:51,781
That's jocelyn.

849
00:50:51,783 --> 00:50:53,549
Yeah, I know that's jocelyn.

850
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:56,018
No, not her, but the one that
just pulled in?

851
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:59,789
Yeah.
that... that
is the real jocelyn.

852
00:50:59,791 --> 00:51:01,924
Oh, my god.

853
00:51:01,926 --> 00:51:07,530
Wow.
that has got to be all sorts of
weird... for you.

854
00:51:07,532 --> 00:51:08,097
Yeah. You think?

855
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:11,033
You got to... you got to handle
this for me.

856
00:51:11,035 --> 00:51:11,500
No.

857
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:13,235
God, no.
It's not part of my deal.

858
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:16,839
Listen, please. Please.
I've had a couple of drinks.

859
00:51:16,841 --> 00:51:18,707
There's no way that I can...

860
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:20,843
just... just...

861
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:22,578
all right.
All right.

862
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:26,382
It's just uncomfortable
listening to you beg.

863
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:31,120
I'm gonna need another hot-tub
scene, huh?

864
00:51:31,122 --> 00:51:32,855
Done. Done.

865
00:51:34,992 --> 00:51:37,326
Done.

866
00:51:37,328 --> 00:51:39,462
Now where's he going?

867
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:44,567
Hey.

868
00:51:44,569 --> 00:51:45,468
Need a hand?

869
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:50,272
Does it look like
I need a hand?

870
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:51,974
Oh.

871
00:51:51,976 --> 00:51:53,976
Where's...

872
00:51:53,978 --> 00:51:54,910
ohh!

873
00:51:54,912 --> 00:51:55,511
I forgot.

874
00:51:55,513 --> 00:51:58,013
He's making his little movie.

875
00:51:58,649 --> 00:52:02,351
You, uh, you must be... jake.

876
00:52:02,353 --> 00:52:04,286
Yeah.
Yep. That's me.

877
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:06,589
I'm... i'm jake.
Let me give you a hand.

878
00:52:06,591 --> 00:52:09,625
I, uh, I should
have been so lucky.

879
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:13,662
Hi.

880
00:52:13,664 --> 00:52:14,864
I'm jocelyn.

881
00:52:14,866 --> 00:52:17,099
Oh, my god!

882
00:52:17,101 --> 00:52:18,601
Really?

883
00:52:18,603 --> 00:52:20,202
You look just like me.

884
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,608
This is...

885
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:26,909
can't believe you guys.

886
00:52:26,911 --> 00:52:27,776
Yeah.
Thanks.

887
00:52:27,778 --> 00:52:29,612
That's really nice of you,
you know that?

888
00:52:29,614 --> 00:52:31,313
Absolutely.
You got a lot of stuff.

889
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:33,682
I know. The kids, you know?
Right. Right.

890
00:52:33,684 --> 00:52:34,783
Well, I mean, I
don't know.

891
00:52:34,785 --> 00:52:37,653
Just... o... kay.

892
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:40,422
I'll, uh...
i'll see you later, then.

893
00:52:40,424 --> 00:52:43,359
We'll see you next week.
Will you still be around?

894
00:52:43,361 --> 00:52:44,760
I mean, I don't know.
I have no idea.

895
00:52:44,762 --> 00:52:46,795
You know,
the way this thing's going...

896
00:52:47,398 --> 00:52:51,367
well, I
hope you'll still be
around.

897
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:59,875
Nice ass.

898
00:52:59,877 --> 00:53:01,477
Whew.

899
00:53:01,479 --> 00:53:03,546
I know you're watching me.

900
00:53:03,548 --> 00:53:05,514
Jesus.

901
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:09,518
Hi, real dad.

902
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,620
Oh. Hey, sweetie.

903
00:53:11,622 --> 00:53:13,289
Whatcha doing out here?

904
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:15,391
Uh... nothing.

905
00:53:15,393 --> 00:53:18,661
Just relaxing, enjoying the
afternoon.

906
00:53:18,663 --> 00:53:21,230
Ah. So I see.

907
00:53:21,232 --> 00:53:24,633
Mm-hmm.
Can I have a sip?

908
00:53:24,635 --> 00:53:25,834
No, it's just water.

909
00:53:25,836 --> 00:53:28,003
Give me a break.

910
00:53:32,577 --> 00:53:34,610
What?
Oh, god.

911
00:53:34,612 --> 00:53:35,277
What is that?

912
00:53:35,279 --> 00:53:37,746
What is... oh! Wow.
That's vodka.

913
00:53:37,748 --> 00:53:39,949
What are you doing
drinking vodka?

914
00:53:39,951 --> 00:53:41,283
Oh, dad.

915
00:53:41,285 --> 00:53:43,586
Oh, dad, dad, dad.

916
00:53:43,588 --> 00:53:44,653
It's after 6:00, anyway.

917
00:53:44,655 --> 00:53:47,523
Yeah, maybe in new york.

918
00:53:47,525 --> 00:53:51,560
So, uh, dad,
can you loan me 20 bucks?

919
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:53,262
Me and alyssa want to catch a
movie later.

920
00:53:53,264 --> 00:53:58,133
Loan you?
you mean you're actually
gonna pay me back?

921
00:53:58,135 --> 00:54:00,069
Don't I always?

922
00:54:00,071 --> 00:54:02,805
Seriously?

923
00:54:02,807 --> 00:54:04,206
Whatever.

924
00:54:04,208 --> 00:54:07,109
Hey, hey. Hey.

925
00:54:08,878 --> 00:54:09,979
Here.

926
00:54:13,084 --> 00:54:14,683
Come on.

927
00:54:14,685 --> 00:54:16,685
$40?
Yeah.

928
00:54:16,687 --> 00:54:18,187
That was it.

929
00:54:18,189 --> 00:54:19,622
Thanks, dad.
All right. All right.

930
00:54:19,624 --> 00:54:21,290
I'll pay you back.
I promise.

931
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:23,659
That's not necessary.
You don't have to.

932
00:54:23,661 --> 00:54:24,827
Thanks, dad. Love you.

933
00:54:24,829 --> 00:54:27,229
Enjoy your... afternoon.

934
00:54:27,231 --> 00:54:28,030
Love you, too.

935
00:54:28,032 --> 00:54:29,898
Did you do your homework?

936
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,100
Um...

937
00:54:31,102 --> 00:54:33,435
well, that's a "no."

938
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:35,804
okay, so, no film, no movie

939
00:54:35,806 --> 00:54:38,173
till you do your homework.

940
00:54:38,175 --> 00:54:40,509
All right, all right.

941
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:46,315
Hey, sweetie!
Hey, dad.

942
00:54:46,317 --> 00:54:49,118
Uh, any homework tomorrow?
Nope.

943
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:52,154
Great!
See you later.

944
00:54:52,156 --> 00:54:54,990
Hey, uh... dad...

945
00:54:54,992 --> 00:54:56,592
can I borrow 20 bucks?

946
00:54:56,594 --> 00:55:00,696
Me and alyssa want to catch a
movie later.

947
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:03,532
Can you borrow 20 bucks?

948
00:55:03,534 --> 00:55:05,200
Yeah.

949
00:55:05,202 --> 00:55:06,435
Um...

950
00:55:06,437 --> 00:55:08,170
yeah. Sure.

951
00:55:10,707 --> 00:55:11,707
20 bucks.

952
00:55:11,709 --> 00:55:13,809
Great.
Thanks, dad.

953
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:15,678
Yeah.

954
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:13,068
All right, what the hell's he
doing now?

955
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:16,271
You look beautiful, sweetie.

956
00:56:16,273 --> 00:56:18,807
Thanks, "dad."

957
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:21,076
you're very talented.

958
00:56:21,078 --> 00:56:25,681
All that money on lessons was
definitely not wasted.

959
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:30,753
Hey.

960
00:56:30,755 --> 00:56:33,622
That was groovy.
We should jam.

961
00:56:33,624 --> 00:56:35,524
He's a really great guitar
player.

962
00:56:35,526 --> 00:56:37,993
He'll blow your mind.
I'm rain.

963
00:56:37,995 --> 00:56:39,962
I'm damian.

964
00:56:39,964 --> 00:56:41,663
Damian.

965
00:56:42,966 --> 00:56:44,400
Really?

966
00:56:44,402 --> 00:56:46,068
Yeah.

967
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:50,072
Nice to meet you.

968
00:56:51,841 --> 00:56:54,343
All right, that's just about
enough.

969
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:58,847
No, no, no! Stop, stop, stop!
I'm telling you, there's, like,

970
00:56:58,849 --> 00:57:00,449
a million dads down there.
So what?

971
00:57:00,451 --> 00:57:02,718
It's just part of the movie.
No, it's not.

972
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:03,485
I read the entire script.

973
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,020
That's not how it's supposed
to be.

974
00:57:05,022 --> 00:57:05,754
What... all five pages?

975
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:07,856
No, there's nothing in there
about all these dads!

976
00:57:07,858 --> 00:57:10,192
All right, all right!
Don't have a heart attack.

977
00:57:10,194 --> 00:57:11,660
I'm not having a heart
attack.

978
00:57:11,662 --> 00:57:13,595
Dad's the one.
He's, like, freaking out!

979
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:16,098
Don't be such a drama queen!

980
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,000
There's even a kid who calls

981
00:57:18,002 --> 00:57:21,303
himself damian and plays the
guitar.

982
00:57:21,305 --> 00:57:22,137
So what?

983
00:57:22,139 --> 00:57:24,006
So that was dad's stage name

984
00:57:24,008 --> 00:57:25,841
when he was some, like, hippie

985
00:57:25,843 --> 00:57:27,643
folk singer in high school.

986
00:57:27,645 --> 00:57:29,044
Remember?

987
00:57:29,046 --> 00:57:30,212
No! Don't.

988
00:57:30,214 --> 00:57:31,647
It'll freak you out.

989
00:57:31,649 --> 00:57:32,781
I'd love to freak out.

990
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:34,349
No, don't...

991
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:37,953
awesome!

992
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:39,488
What are you doing here?

993
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:40,522
Uh...

994
00:57:40,524 --> 00:57:43,058
I don't know.

995
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:44,359
Not sure.

996
00:57:44,361 --> 00:57:45,694
Yeah, I, uh...

997
00:57:45,696 --> 00:57:47,062
this is
my movie.

998
00:57:47,064 --> 00:57:49,765
I say what happens.

999
00:57:49,767 --> 00:57:51,400
Oh, yeah, big shot?

1000
00:57:51,402 --> 00:57:52,267
What happens?

1001
00:57:52,269 --> 00:57:52,801
I don't know.

1002
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:55,537
But you're not supposed to be
here.

1003
00:57:55,539 --> 00:57:58,006
Only he is.

1004
00:57:58,008 --> 00:57:59,141
What? oh.

1005
00:57:59,143 --> 00:57:59,608
Don't look at me.

1006
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:02,578
Well, maybe we're just trying
to figure out the same
thing as you.

1007
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:05,881
Maybe... maybe that's why
we're here... to help you.

1008
00:58:05,883 --> 00:58:08,116
With what?
Love.

1009
00:58:08,118 --> 00:58:10,185
How to find it.
How to keep it.

1010
00:58:10,187 --> 00:58:11,987
Hey, guys, I don't mean to
interrupt or anything, 'cause,

1011
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:14,723
you know, clearly you got a lot
to work through here.
What?

1012
00:58:14,725 --> 00:58:15,924
I'm just looking at the call
sheet here.

1013
00:58:15,926 --> 00:58:20,095
I'm wondering if any of you
happened to notice which way,
uh...

1014
00:58:20,097 --> 00:58:22,097
uh, bathing beauty 3 went?

1015
00:58:22,099 --> 00:58:23,398
Are you kidding?

1016
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,667
She thought you were a little
harsh on her.

1017
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:26,768
You know, all the jew stuff.

1018
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:28,003
So I figured that I'd, uh...

1019
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:28,770
oh, my god.

1020
00:58:28,772 --> 00:58:31,340
Okay, whatever.
Listen, I'll just... i'll leave

1021
00:58:31,342 --> 00:58:33,408
you guys to it.

1022
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:38,046
We just want to fall in love.
Same as you.

1023
00:58:38,048 --> 00:58:39,381
I don't want to fall in love.

1024
00:58:39,383 --> 00:58:41,850
Been there, done that.

1025
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:49,157
Just think how you felt when
you first met joanne.

1026
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:51,393
How beautiful it was.

1027
00:58:51,395 --> 00:58:53,829
And what did you do?

1028
00:58:53,831 --> 00:58:55,163
You totally blew it.

1029
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:55,864
He does?

1030
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:58,200
There's still time.

1031
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:06,808
Huh.

1032
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:08,577
That's not a real quote.
Yeah, it is.

1033
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:11,079
It's from a song.
That I wrote.

1034
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:14,283
So that doesn't count.

1035
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:20,322
Come on. You know this one.

1036
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:29,398
You know this one.

1037
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:41,870
Huh.

1038
01:00:41,872 --> 01:00:42,872
Shall we?

1039
01:00:42,873 --> 01:00:44,473
Yeah.

1040
01:00:45,842 --> 01:00:46,842
Uh...

1041
01:00:46,844 --> 01:00:50,712
anyone else think that song was
a little harsh?

1042
01:00:50,714 --> 01:00:51,113
Kinda.

1043
01:00:51,115 --> 01:00:53,682
Is that seriously how I'm
gonna become?

1044
01:00:53,684 --> 01:00:55,550
No. Never.

1045
01:00:55,552 --> 01:00:56,552
I mean, he's so jaded.

1046
01:00:56,553 --> 01:00:57,819
You're nothing like that.

1047
01:00:57,821 --> 01:01:00,656
Crap.
You don't get it.

1048
01:01:00,658 --> 01:01:02,290
Sure we do.

1049
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:04,459
You're just a helpless... oh, I

1050
01:01:04,461 --> 01:01:07,562
mean,
hopeless romantic.

1051
01:01:09,565 --> 01:01:11,133
That's it.

1052
01:01:11,135 --> 01:01:13,035
Run away.

1053
01:01:13,037 --> 01:01:14,403
Same as always.

1054
01:01:14,405 --> 01:01:16,371
Don't blame us when we end up

1055
01:01:16,373 --> 01:01:18,206
old and alone and in a room

1056
01:01:18,208 --> 01:01:20,342
somewhere with no one to even

1057
01:01:20,344 --> 01:01:21,376
change our diaper.

1058
01:01:21,378 --> 01:01:23,745
Whose fault would it be then,

1059
01:01:23,747 --> 01:01:24,646
huh?

1060
01:01:24,648 --> 01:01:27,182
Okay, fuck you.

1061
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:28,184
Fuck you.

1062
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:31,086
You better be gone when I get
back.

1063
01:01:31,088 --> 01:01:33,422
All of you!

1064
01:01:35,491 --> 01:01:36,758
All of you.

1065
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:48,470
This is so awesome.

1066
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:56,244
Making movies sucks.

1067
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:00,816
I'd rather pay bills and balance
checkbooks.

1068
01:02:00,818 --> 01:02:02,217
I should have been an
accountant.

1069
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:04,419
Everything would have been so
much easier!

1070
01:02:04,421 --> 01:02:07,189
One... i could have
been a cool

1071
01:02:07,191 --> 01:02:09,224
accountant, not a nerdy one.

1072
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:12,060
Cool... the hank moody of
accountants.

1073
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:13,962
Cool clothes, cool chicks, cool

1074
01:02:13,964 --> 01:02:16,465
cars, cool watches, cool,
cool, cool.

1075
01:02:16,467 --> 01:02:19,201
Two... meet some beautiful
girls.

1076
01:02:19,203 --> 01:02:20,235
"what do you do?"

1077
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:21,803
"me? I'm an accountant."

1078
01:02:21,805 --> 01:02:22,504
"ooh! Really?"

1079
01:02:22,506 --> 01:02:24,473
"yeah, I play around with other

1080
01:02:24,475 --> 01:02:26,541
people's money all day long."

1081
01:02:26,543 --> 01:02:28,210
"that's so sexy."

1082
01:02:28,212 --> 01:02:30,112
"yeah.
Let's go back to my place."

1083
01:02:30,114 --> 01:02:32,614
"I thought you'd never ask."

1084
01:02:32,616 --> 01:02:34,349
I heard that.

1085
01:02:34,351 --> 01:02:35,617
Hey.

1086
01:02:35,619 --> 01:02:37,552
You did not.

1087
01:02:37,554 --> 01:02:40,522
It's all internal dialogue.

1088
01:02:40,524 --> 01:02:41,656
I'm not exactly sure what

1089
01:02:41,658 --> 01:02:45,594
that means, but I heard it
nevertheless.

1090
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,601
Thank you.

1091
01:02:52,603 --> 01:02:53,902
Hey, jake.

1092
01:02:53,904 --> 01:02:56,204
Yeah?

1093
01:02:56,206 --> 01:02:57,739
Do you want to make out?

1094
01:02:57,741 --> 01:02:58,273
Say what?

1095
01:02:58,275 --> 01:03:02,477
I was just... thinking you and
I should make out.

1096
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:05,680
Why?

1097
01:03:07,251 --> 01:03:08,784
No reason.

1098
01:03:08,786 --> 01:03:11,386
Just because.

1099
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:17,292
Hey, didn't we make out one time
before?

1100
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:17,859
Yeah.

1101
01:03:17,861 --> 01:03:23,198
Like 25 years ago, when we first
met, but, like, for a second,
maybe.

1102
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,734
I-I don't remember that.

1103
01:03:25,736 --> 01:03:26,468
Thanks.

1104
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:27,536
No, I mean, no offense.

1105
01:03:27,538 --> 01:03:28,403
It's just... are you sure?

1106
01:03:28,405 --> 01:03:30,839
Yeah.
I don't forget things like that.

1107
01:03:30,841 --> 01:03:31,306
Oh, yeah?

1108
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:32,641
Well, what about that woman we

1109
01:03:32,643 --> 01:03:34,176
met that time and she went on

1110
01:03:34,178 --> 01:03:35,510
and on about how you dated and

1111
01:03:35,512 --> 01:03:38,713
you hadn't a clue who she was?

1112
01:03:38,715 --> 01:03:39,447
No, she was lying.

1113
01:03:39,449 --> 01:03:41,516
I'd never seen her before
in my life.

1114
01:03:41,518 --> 01:03:42,584
Why would she do that?

1115
01:03:42,586 --> 01:03:44,085
Well, because you don't

1116
01:03:44,087 --> 01:03:45,787
remember making out
with me.

1117
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:50,926
Let's go for a hike.

1118
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:54,763
But I was serious.

1119
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,001
Really?

1120
01:04:01,938 --> 01:04:04,005
Yeah.

1121
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:31,366
That was fun.

1122
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:33,635
It was even better than the
first time.

1123
01:04:33,637 --> 01:04:37,439
I thought you didn't remember
the first time.

1124
01:04:37,441 --> 01:04:38,974
I don't.

1125
01:04:38,976 --> 01:04:43,011
But if it was that good,
I wouldn't have forgotten.

1126
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:47,215
Okay. Let's go for a hike.

1127
01:04:50,186 --> 01:04:52,554
Yeah. Whatever.

1128
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:07,035
Hey! Jake!

1129
01:05:07,037 --> 01:05:07,569
Yeah.

1130
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:10,105
Jake, am I working today?

1131
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:14,709
Dibs on the porsche.

1132
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:17,512
I got the volvo!

1133
01:05:17,514 --> 01:05:18,313
Hey! What about me?!

1134
01:05:18,315 --> 01:05:21,216
Maybe I want to go somewhere,
too, you jerks!

1135
01:05:21,218 --> 01:05:26,087
Okay, does anybody know if
I'm working today?

1136
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:30,892
Hey.

1137
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:34,829
This your first day?

1138
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,800
Ohh.

1139
01:05:38,802 --> 01:05:39,601
Old porsche.

1140
01:05:39,603 --> 01:05:41,636
Ooh.
Oh, my god.

1141
01:05:41,638 --> 01:05:43,538
I love that sound.

1142
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:52,080
Oh, hell no.

1143
01:05:55,018 --> 01:05:58,553
What is this...
cirque du soleil?

1144
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:03,058
Hey!
You should be wearing a helmet!

1145
01:06:04,895 --> 01:06:06,962
Come on.

1146
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:21,977
Well?

1147
01:06:21,979 --> 01:06:26,014
It's not easy reading
backwards.

1148
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:29,651
"daily om."

1149
01:06:29,653 --> 01:06:33,021
that's a lot of pressure.

1150
01:06:33,023 --> 01:06:34,389
I rely on you.

1151
01:06:34,992 --> 01:06:37,692
A quote from a website...
really?

1152
01:06:37,694 --> 01:06:38,526
Yeah.

1153
01:06:38,528 --> 01:06:41,196
And I'm very confused.

1154
01:06:42,565 --> 01:06:46,668
Well, then you've come to the
right place.

1155
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:48,036
Tell me something, jake.

1156
01:06:48,038 --> 01:06:48,803
Mm-hmm.

1157
01:06:48,805 --> 01:06:49,637
Are you happy?

1158
01:06:49,639 --> 01:06:51,072
I don't know why I
wouldn't be.

1159
01:06:51,074 --> 01:06:53,775
I mean, I've got so much to be
happy about, you know?

1160
01:06:53,777 --> 01:06:55,143
I mean, I got a beautiful home,

1161
01:06:55,145 --> 01:06:59,180
friends, some money,
wonderful kids. You know?

1162
01:06:59,182 --> 01:07:00,882
I'm still meeting women, which,

1163
01:07:00,884 --> 01:07:04,119
at my age, is, you know, it's
pretty amazing.

1164
01:07:04,121 --> 01:07:08,156
So... yeah.
I'm... i'm happy.

1165
01:07:08,158 --> 01:07:10,225
Of course, those things have

1166
01:07:10,227 --> 01:07:12,527
nothing to do with the question

1167
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:13,529
I'm asking you.

1168
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:15,797
I mean, you can go out for a

1169
01:07:15,799 --> 01:07:17,732
great dinner, you can...

1170
01:07:17,734 --> 01:07:19,534
kiss a beautiful woman.

1171
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:21,436
These are pleasures, you know?

1172
01:07:21,438 --> 01:07:25,573
You... you feel a rush of
endorphins in that moment.

1173
01:07:25,575 --> 01:07:27,142
You can have great moments of

1174
01:07:27,144 --> 01:07:30,378
pleasure in your life and still
be unhappy.

1175
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:32,080
So, my question remains...

1176
01:07:32,082 --> 01:07:33,481
are you happy?

1177
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,521
I guess if you put it that way,

1178
01:07:39,523 --> 01:07:41,456
no, I'm not.

1179
01:07:42,324 --> 01:07:44,225
Big surprise.

1180
01:07:45,695 --> 01:07:47,162
Mitch klein?

1181
01:07:47,164 --> 01:07:47,862
Hello, dear.

1182
01:07:47,864 --> 01:07:49,564
Jake, that's your father!

1183
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:50,532
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

1184
01:07:50,534 --> 01:07:52,934
You're... he's... he's...
dead?

1185
01:07:52,936 --> 01:07:54,002
What can I say?

1186
01:07:54,004 --> 01:07:56,371
He's like the ghost of
jacob marley.

1187
01:07:56,373 --> 01:07:57,672
Where are your chains, dad?

1188
01:07:57,674 --> 01:07:59,140
Jacob who?
Never mind.

1189
01:07:59,142 --> 01:08:01,009
I did most of the reading
in the family.

1190
01:08:01,011 --> 01:08:03,645
Jake, it's no wonder you're
not happy.

1191
01:08:03,647 --> 01:08:05,880
You should have never ended your

1192
01:08:05,882 --> 01:08:06,181
marriage.

1193
01:08:06,183 --> 01:08:08,850
I didn't end my marriage,
dad.

1194
01:08:08,852 --> 01:08:09,350
She left me.

1195
01:08:09,352 --> 01:08:11,252
Successful marriage is the
key to happiness.

1196
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:11,986
I didn't leave her, dad.

1197
01:08:11,988 --> 01:08:14,456
Your mother and I were
married 55 years... until I

1198
01:08:14,458 --> 01:08:16,558
passed away,
which kind of ended that.

1199
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,493
Yeah? Well,
maybe it wasn't such a bed

1200
01:08:18,495 --> 01:08:19,227
of roses as you might think.

1201
01:08:19,229 --> 01:08:21,196
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't know.

1202
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:25,834
Maybe mom...
thought you were difficult.

1203
01:08:25,836 --> 01:08:28,069
She said that?

1204
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:32,907
No, she didn't.
I-i'm just talking shit.

1205
01:08:32,909 --> 01:08:33,541
I'm sorry.

1206
01:08:33,543 --> 01:08:35,243
I guess it's because, you know,

1207
01:08:35,245 --> 01:08:36,744
you just keep saying that I left

1208
01:08:36,746 --> 01:08:37,879
my marriage, which I didn't do.

1209
01:08:37,881 --> 01:08:41,382
Jake, I don't know how you
could have done what you did.

1210
01:08:41,384 --> 01:08:43,952
I didn't leave her, dad!

1211
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:47,622
What, am I talking to myself?

1212
01:08:47,624 --> 01:08:48,723
Apparently.

1213
01:08:50,861 --> 01:08:52,727
Oy. oy.

1214
01:08:52,729 --> 01:08:54,796
Beth, this is my grandfather.

1215
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:56,865
He's been dead for 30 years.

1216
01:08:56,867 --> 01:08:57,332
Uh...

1217
01:08:57,334 --> 01:09:00,935
granddad, this is my best
friend, beth.

1218
01:09:00,937 --> 01:09:02,904
Ah.
Very attractive.

1219
01:09:02,906 --> 01:09:04,606
Thank you.

1220
01:09:04,608 --> 01:09:06,274
Jewish?
No.

1221
01:09:06,276 --> 01:09:08,376
She's, uh, she's not jewish,
grandpa.

1222
01:09:08,378 --> 01:09:09,777
At your age, I suppose it

1223
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:10,879
doesn't make that much

1224
01:09:10,881 --> 01:09:11,412
difference,
tateleh.

1225
01:09:11,414 --> 01:09:13,781
You're certainly not gonna have
any kids anymore.

1226
01:09:13,783 --> 01:09:16,684
But, believe me, you're much
better off with a jewish girl.

1227
01:09:16,686 --> 01:09:19,521
We're... we're just best
friends, grandpa.

1228
01:09:19,523 --> 01:09:21,756
What ever happened to
joanne cohen?

1229
01:09:21,758 --> 01:09:23,458
She may have been your cousin,

1230
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:24,926
but at least she was jewish.

1231
01:09:24,928 --> 01:09:26,694
Okay, hello. Hello.

1232
01:09:26,696 --> 01:09:27,762
I'm right here.

1233
01:09:27,764 --> 01:09:28,863
I'm sorry, dear.

1234
01:09:28,865 --> 01:09:30,131
I-I don't mean any harm.

1235
01:09:30,133 --> 01:09:32,800
I'm just a silly, old, jewish
grandfather.

1236
01:09:32,802 --> 01:09:33,968
And I'm sure that your family

1237
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:37,138
would much rather you marry some
nice catholic boy.

1238
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:38,273
Um...

1239
01:09:38,275 --> 01:09:40,942
I'm protestant.

1240
01:09:40,944 --> 01:09:41,442
I...

1241
01:09:41,444 --> 01:09:43,311
but, anyway, as jake said, we're
just good friends.

1242
01:09:43,313 --> 01:09:45,413
And that was some friendly
kiss back there.

1243
01:09:45,415 --> 01:09:46,881
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a second.

1244
01:09:46,883 --> 01:09:50,051
I've just had about enough
of this.

1245
01:09:50,053 --> 01:09:52,420
What do you two guys want?

1246
01:09:52,422 --> 01:09:54,889
I'm all grown up now, you know?

1247
01:09:54,891 --> 01:09:55,223
Shit.

1248
01:09:55,225 --> 01:09:57,792
I mean, I'll... i'll be
collecting social security

1249
01:09:57,794 --> 01:09:58,359
before you know it.

1250
01:09:58,361 --> 01:10:00,428
Does anybody know the
combination to this lock?

1251
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:02,397
I'm getting, like,
really exhausted.

1252
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:05,967
I want to, you know, like, lock
this thing up someplace.

1253
01:10:05,969 --> 01:10:06,734
Jakey!

1254
01:10:06,736 --> 01:10:08,369
"damian"!

1255
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:10,171
Hi, grandpa.

1256
01:10:10,173 --> 01:10:11,272
Jake!

1257
01:10:11,274 --> 01:10:14,008
Sheryl?

1258
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:16,144
Oh, shit.

1259
01:10:16,146 --> 01:10:18,947
Oh, no, no, no.

1260
01:10:18,949 --> 01:10:20,181
Stay! no!

1261
01:10:20,183 --> 01:10:21,616
No! Hey, hey!

1262
01:10:21,618 --> 01:10:24,085
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi!
Oh.

1263
01:10:24,087 --> 01:10:25,019
Hell no.

1264
01:10:25,021 --> 01:10:27,455
Hell no!

1265
01:10:27,457 --> 01:10:28,489
Jake!

1266
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:29,257
Jake!

1267
01:10:29,259 --> 01:10:31,392
Jake! Jake!

1268
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:35,029
Oh, shit! Shit! Shit!
Sorry! Sorry!

1269
01:10:35,031 --> 01:10:35,430
Hey, man!

1270
01:10:35,432 --> 01:10:37,699
My past... it's catching up
with me!

1271
01:10:37,701 --> 01:10:39,300
I'm serious!
Look out!

1272
01:10:39,302 --> 01:10:43,071
Look o-o-o-o-out!!

1273
01:10:43,073 --> 01:10:44,339
Oh. So sorry.

1274
01:10:44,341 --> 01:10:46,641
What the hell?

1275
01:10:46,643 --> 01:10:47,108
Jake, wait!

1276
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:49,344
I came all the way from chicago!

1277
01:10:49,346 --> 01:10:50,211
Sorry!

1278
01:10:50,213 --> 01:10:51,846
Jesus!

1279
01:10:55,452 --> 01:10:57,118
Joanne?

1280
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:05,827
Jake!

1281
01:11:05,829 --> 01:11:07,795
Jake!

1282
01:11:07,797 --> 01:11:10,498
Am I working today or not?

1283
01:11:12,968 --> 01:11:14,502
Hey.

1284
01:11:58,947 --> 01:12:00,214
Shh.

1285
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,020
Hey.

1286
01:12:06,022 --> 01:12:07,455
Hello.

1287
01:12:11,594 --> 01:12:13,027
Noisy, isn't he?

1288
01:12:14,097 --> 01:12:16,431
Yeah. You always were.

1289
01:12:16,433 --> 01:12:17,965
I was not.

1290
01:12:17,967 --> 01:12:20,201
Ohhh.

1291
01:12:26,075 --> 01:12:29,610
Are you really joanne?

1292
01:12:29,612 --> 01:12:31,212
Yeah.

1293
01:12:32,381 --> 01:12:35,216
My joanne?

1294
01:12:35,218 --> 01:12:36,951
Yes.

1295
01:12:38,188 --> 01:12:40,021
Far out.

1296
01:12:45,627 --> 01:12:48,596
Chicago... all the way from
chicago.

1297
01:12:48,598 --> 01:12:49,297
And you do this... you guys

1298
01:12:49,299 --> 01:12:52,834
do this... you see each other
two or three times a year?

1299
01:12:52,836 --> 01:12:54,035
Yes.

1300
01:12:54,037 --> 01:12:55,503
You serious?

1301
01:12:55,505 --> 01:12:57,438
Why? Why would you do that?

1302
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:00,007
Well, I probably wouldn't if

1303
01:13:00,009 --> 01:13:03,478
it were anyone else.

1304
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:06,114
Huh.

1305
01:13:06,116 --> 01:13:09,917
Oh.
I'm sor... i'm sorry.

1306
01:13:09,919 --> 01:13:13,521
I just...
i think he's a jerk.

1307
01:13:13,523 --> 01:13:15,390
I... no.
if... if...
if it were

1308
01:13:15,392 --> 01:13:20,828
me, I mean, I would not let you
out of my sight for a second,

1309
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:22,697
and I mean that.
No, seriously.

1310
01:13:22,699 --> 01:13:25,032
I-I think you've got it all.
Look at you.

1311
01:13:25,034 --> 01:13:27,168
You're... you're... you're
beautiful.

1312
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:30,238
You're... you know, you're
funny, you're smart.

1313
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:32,607
I think...

1314
01:13:32,609 --> 01:13:35,076
I just think that he is out of
his mind.

1315
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:36,043
That's what I think.

1316
01:13:36,045 --> 01:13:37,512
Well...

1317
01:13:37,514 --> 01:13:41,682
as a matter of fact,
I have thought that myself...

1318
01:13:41,684 --> 01:13:43,050
on occasion.
On occasion?

1319
01:13:43,052 --> 01:13:45,853
Try working for him, okay?

1320
01:13:45,855 --> 01:13:48,856
It's just "ooh-ooh!"

1321
01:13:50,393 --> 01:13:54,896
how much, uh, how much longer
you in town?

1322
01:13:54,898 --> 01:14:00,034
Mm... it depends.
I don't know.

1323
01:14:00,036 --> 01:14:05,072
You guys planning on seeing
each other that time or...

1324
01:14:05,074 --> 01:14:07,408
well, talk to jake.

1325
01:14:09,212 --> 01:14:10,945
I'll talk to jake, all right.

1326
01:14:15,852 --> 01:14:19,654
So... how have you been all
this time?

1327
01:14:19,656 --> 01:14:22,089
Like, who are you?
I mean...

1328
01:14:22,091 --> 01:14:23,357
who did you become?

1329
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:25,927
You know, what did you do?

1330
01:14:25,929 --> 01:14:28,629
Becoming me.

1331
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:30,898
I've had a beautiful life.

1332
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:32,900
So what are you now?

1333
01:14:32,902 --> 01:14:34,435
Like...40?

1334
01:14:35,438 --> 01:14:37,138
40?

1335
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:38,206
God, I wish.

1336
01:14:38,208 --> 01:14:41,142
No, you're gonna have to add
quite a bit to that.

1337
01:14:41,144 --> 01:14:45,780
So, did you ever get married
or did you ever have kids?

1338
01:14:45,782 --> 01:14:49,350
Yeah, I was married once
a long time ago.

1339
01:14:49,352 --> 01:14:52,053
Didn't work out.

1340
01:14:52,055 --> 01:14:54,021
I have a daughter.

1341
01:14:54,023 --> 01:14:56,390
She's a grown woman now.

1342
01:14:59,528 --> 01:15:01,896
We were supposed
to have kids.

1343
01:15:01,898 --> 01:15:05,333
I mean, we used to talk about
that all the time.

1344
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:13,674
And what the hell happened?

1345
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:18,846
I mean, how... how is it that we
didn't end up together?

1346
01:15:19,282 --> 01:15:22,116
I guess we both just needed to
be free.

1347
01:15:22,118 --> 01:15:24,051
What does that even mean?

1348
01:15:24,053 --> 01:15:24,986
I mean, I don't get that.

1349
01:15:24,988 --> 01:15:28,055
I mean, who says I ever wanted
to be free?

1350
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:43,504
Rise and shine!

1351
01:15:43,506 --> 01:15:45,406
Let's go! Get up!

1352
01:15:45,408 --> 01:15:46,807
Gonna be late for school!

1353
01:15:46,809 --> 01:15:48,676
Go!

1354
01:15:57,419 --> 01:15:58,653
I met him on jdate.

1355
01:15:58,655 --> 01:16:01,856
And, then, that's a jewish
dating site, isn't it?

1356
01:16:01,858 --> 01:16:03,357
Yes.

1357
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:05,726
So, you're jewish.

1358
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:06,794
No.

1359
01:16:06,796 --> 01:16:08,563
So, then, why were you on
jdate?

1360
01:16:08,565 --> 01:16:10,965
Lots of girls who aren't
jewish are.

1361
01:16:10,967 --> 01:16:12,266
I like jewish guys.

1362
01:16:12,268 --> 01:16:12,967
Why is that?

1363
01:16:12,969 --> 01:16:15,169
Are you... are you some sort of
a woody allen fan?

1364
01:16:15,171 --> 01:16:17,905
Something like that?

1365
01:16:18,441 --> 01:16:21,142
Everybody knows that jewish

1366
01:16:21,144 --> 01:16:23,411
men make the best providers.

1367
01:16:23,413 --> 01:16:26,581
And they never hit their wives.

1368
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:30,284
Well, I thought he was nice and
all that.

1369
01:16:30,286 --> 01:16:31,385
But, um...

1370
01:16:31,387 --> 01:16:34,055
he wasn't really my type.

1371
01:16:34,057 --> 01:16:35,423
A little too jewish.

1372
01:16:35,425 --> 01:16:38,125
So... so it wasn't a match.

1373
01:16:38,127 --> 01:16:39,327
No way.

1374
01:16:40,663 --> 01:16:43,364
But... but he was totally
into me, though.

1375
01:16:43,366 --> 01:16:45,933
I-I kind of felt bad about that.

1376
01:16:45,935 --> 01:16:46,801
Well, it was obvious.

1377
01:16:46,803 --> 01:16:49,270
He sent me a bunch of e-mails
after that.

1378
01:16:49,272 --> 01:16:49,971
I just never answered.

1379
01:16:49,973 --> 01:16:53,507
That is such bull.
I didn't e-mail you.

1380
01:16:53,509 --> 01:16:54,275
You did too.

1381
01:16:54,277 --> 01:16:57,044
No, yo... no, no.
You e-mailed me.

1382
01:16:57,046 --> 01:16:58,613
As if.

1383
01:16:58,615 --> 01:17:00,448
You want me to get my laptop?
I-i-i'll show you.

1384
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:03,017
Okay, all right, all right,
all right, you two...

1385
01:17:03,019 --> 01:17:04,485
plus... plus...

1386
01:17:04,487 --> 01:17:06,153
he lied on his profile.

1387
01:17:06,155 --> 01:17:08,522
I think he lied about his age.

1388
01:17:08,524 --> 01:17:09,557
Is that true?

1389
01:17:10,893 --> 01:17:12,126
It's totally not true.

1390
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:12,793
Yeah. I doubt that.

1391
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:16,430
What about you?
Your profile said that you were

1392
01:17:16,432 --> 01:17:18,399
slender.

1393
01:17:18,401 --> 01:17:19,700
And?

1394
01:17:19,702 --> 01:17:21,002
And...

1395
01:17:21,004 --> 01:17:22,370
listen, I think you're lovely.

1396
01:17:22,372 --> 01:17:23,638
I just can't understand why you

1397
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,940
just wouldn't describe yourself
as you really are.

1398
01:17:25,942 --> 01:17:28,809
And that way, you would just get
calls from guys who are only

1399
01:17:28,811 --> 01:17:33,014
into... interested
in people like you.

1400
01:17:33,016 --> 01:17:33,781
People like me?

1401
01:17:33,783 --> 01:17:36,751
Yeah... people who aren't...

1402
01:17:36,753 --> 01:17:38,753
slender.

1403
01:17:38,755 --> 01:17:42,490
I am slender.

1404
01:17:44,593 --> 01:17:46,627
Okay, let's get out of here,
kids.

1405
01:17:46,629 --> 01:17:48,062
We're gonna be late.

1406
01:17:48,064 --> 01:17:49,497
I'm slender.

1407
01:17:49,499 --> 01:17:50,665
Absolutely.

1408
01:17:50,667 --> 01:17:53,300
Are you jewish?

1409
01:17:53,302 --> 01:17:54,835
What?
You were on jdate?

1410
01:17:54,837 --> 01:17:58,072
Yeah, but just for one
second.

1411
01:17:58,074 --> 01:17:58,506
That's all.

1412
01:17:58,508 --> 01:18:01,108
You're... you're...
you're such a loser.

1413
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:02,009
No, I'm not!

1414
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:04,278
I think it's great that people
take their destinies into their
hands.

1415
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:07,348
I know a lot of people who have
met their husbands and wives
that way.

1416
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:08,949
It just wasn't for me.
Come on.

1417
01:18:08,951 --> 01:18:09,784
Come on, come on, come on.

1418
01:18:09,786 --> 01:18:11,719
I need the keys. Buh-bye.
Hey!

1419
01:18:11,721 --> 01:18:13,187
Driver!

1420
01:18:15,825 --> 01:18:17,425
Hey!

1421
01:18:17,427 --> 01:18:18,159
Wait up!

1422
01:18:18,161 --> 01:18:20,528
The hell you think you're
going?

1423
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:22,329
School, man.
Driver.

1424
01:18:22,331 --> 01:18:23,030
Uh, get real, dude.

1425
01:18:23,032 --> 01:18:24,832
You're totally in the wrong
generation.

1426
01:18:24,834 --> 01:18:27,768
Do you even know what an
automatic transmission is?

1427
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:30,504
Why are you going to school,
anyway?

1428
01:18:30,506 --> 01:18:31,672
Uh, I don't know.

1429
01:18:31,674 --> 01:18:33,441
Aren't I supposed to?

1430
01:18:33,443 --> 01:18:35,276
How old are you?

1431
01:18:35,278 --> 01:18:37,545
17.

1432
01:18:37,547 --> 01:18:40,448
Get in.

1433
01:18:40,450 --> 01:18:42,650
Scoot over.

1434
01:18:44,453 --> 01:18:45,453
All right.

1435
01:18:45,455 --> 01:18:48,856
Make sure you don't hit the
fence.

1436
01:18:48,858 --> 01:18:50,057
Again.

1437
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:51,392
Got it, loser.

1438
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:54,395
You know, give me the keys.

1439
01:18:54,397 --> 01:18:56,197
W-w-what are you doing?

1440
01:18:56,199 --> 01:18:57,531
We're gonna be late.

1441
01:18:57,533 --> 01:18:59,667
No, we won't.

1442
01:18:59,669 --> 01:19:01,836
Dad...

1443
01:19:01,838 --> 01:19:03,104
oh, my god.

1444
01:19:03,106 --> 01:19:05,339
Why does everybody keep doing
this?

1445
01:19:05,341 --> 01:19:07,408
Stepping out.

1446
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:10,144
You know, sometimes this is,
um...

1447
01:19:11,047 --> 01:19:12,947
um...
i mean, what I'm trying
to say...

1448
01:19:12,949 --> 01:19:15,983
trying to say is, um...
what I want to say...

1449
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:21,422
these things that are...
that are happening to me...

1450
01:19:23,392 --> 01:19:26,594
come on, dad! Let's go!

1451
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:32,500
Ah. Shit.

1452
01:19:33,202 --> 01:19:35,169
Marcus aurelius,
emperor of

1453
01:19:35,171 --> 01:19:36,103
rome in the second century

1454
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:37,705
a.d., reigned through war
and disaster.

1455
01:19:37,707 --> 01:19:40,741
He thought that all things in
life flowed naturally and it

1456
01:19:40,743 --> 01:19:45,846
was better to go with the flow
than to fight against it.

1457
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:53,320
Marcus aurelius... seriously?

1458
01:19:53,322 --> 01:19:56,223
Would have thought it was
the beatles.

1459
01:19:56,225 --> 01:19:58,926
All right. I give up.

1460
01:19:58,928 --> 01:20:00,127
I can do that.

1461
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:02,730
I can do that. I can relax.

1462
01:20:02,732 --> 01:20:04,098
Go with the flow.

1463
01:20:05,401 --> 01:20:09,503
I wonder who said "do your own
thing."

1464
01:20:09,505 --> 01:20:11,572
julius caesar?

1465
01:20:15,443 --> 01:20:16,744
Let's go.

1466
01:20:16,746 --> 01:20:19,113
Let's go with the flow.

1467
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:46,507
I can tell there's a
gentleman in there.

1468
01:20:46,509 --> 01:20:47,708
Hey. Jake.

1469
01:20:47,710 --> 01:20:48,475
Hey, jake.

1470
01:20:48,477 --> 01:20:51,212
Oh, wow.
You're both named jake?

1471
01:20:51,214 --> 01:20:53,080
Jake and jake.
Jake squared.

1472
01:20:53,082 --> 01:20:56,550
More like jake to the fifth.
Huh?

1473
01:20:56,552 --> 01:20:58,219
It's an inside joke.

1474
01:20:58,221 --> 01:20:59,386
Oh.
Yeah.

1475
01:21:00,122 --> 01:21:01,655
But remember...
i'm jake and

1476
01:21:01,657 --> 01:21:02,790
he's jake,
but a lot of people

1477
01:21:02,792 --> 01:21:06,026
think that he's jake and
I'm jake, but it's really
the other way around.

1478
01:21:06,028 --> 01:21:08,062
Nah, he's full of it.
Don't listen to him.

1479
01:21:08,064 --> 01:21:10,464
I'm jake.
He's... he's jake.

1480
01:21:10,466 --> 01:21:10,998
Okay.

1481
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,167
> hey, jake, can you meet me in
the dining room in 10 minutes?

1482
01:21:13,169 --> 01:21:15,336
What's up, jake?
Nothing... i just have a few

1483
01:21:15,338 --> 01:21:17,071
things I want to talk over with
everyone.

1484
01:21:17,073 --> 01:21:19,273
No problem.
I'll be right there, jake.

1485
01:21:19,275 --> 01:21:20,474
Oh. Me too?

1486
01:21:20,476 --> 01:21:23,777
No, just jakes.

1487
01:21:23,779 --> 01:21:26,547
Oh. Okay.

1488
01:21:26,549 --> 01:21:27,448
Well...

1489
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:28,349
jake.

1490
01:21:28,351 --> 01:21:29,984
It was really nice talking
with you.

1491
01:21:29,986 --> 01:21:32,119
Mm-hmm.
How about we talk a little

1492
01:21:32,121 --> 01:21:34,955
more about that part after your
meeting?

1493
01:21:34,957 --> 01:21:35,422
Yeah?
What?

1494
01:21:35,424 --> 01:21:39,860
Like you wouldn't do
the same thing if
you were making a movie?

1495
01:21:48,536 --> 01:21:51,572
Richie?

1496
01:21:51,574 --> 01:21:54,441
Is that you? Richie madden?

1497
01:21:54,443 --> 01:21:56,777
I'm
richard madden.

1498
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:00,447
Nice to see you,
my young friend.

1499
01:22:00,449 --> 01:22:01,248
How are you?

1500
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:02,082
I'm... i'm fine!

1501
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:05,920
But... look at you...
all growed up!

1502
01:22:05,922 --> 01:22:07,154
I can't believe it!

1503
01:22:07,156 --> 01:22:08,789
It's like gandalf the grey.

1504
01:22:08,791 --> 01:22:10,624
And look at that stomach!

1505
01:22:11,594 --> 01:22:12,626
Excuse me?

1506
01:22:12,628 --> 01:22:14,295
Oh, god, no, I'm sorry.

1507
01:22:14,297 --> 01:22:15,162
I'm just kidding.

1508
01:22:15,164 --> 01:22:16,297
No, really, though, man,

1509
01:22:16,299 --> 01:22:18,299
you really let yourself go!

1510
01:22:18,301 --> 01:22:20,768
I-I-i'm sorry.
I'm not really remembering...

1511
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:22,670
hey, jake.
Hey, man, listen, I'm calling a

1512
01:22:22,672 --> 01:22:24,405
little meeting
in the dining room.

1513
01:22:24,407 --> 01:22:25,773
All the others are coming.

1514
01:22:25,775 --> 01:22:26,674
Okay, great.

1515
01:22:26,676 --> 01:22:28,142
All right?

1516
01:22:28,144 --> 01:22:29,076
Jake.

1517
01:22:29,078 --> 01:22:30,477
Yeah?

1518
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:31,879
Hey. Richard. How's it going?

1519
01:22:31,881 --> 01:22:32,947
What's going on here?

1520
01:22:32,949 --> 01:22:33,781
Oh, nothing, man.

1521
01:22:33,783 --> 01:22:35,649
Just got a little family issue.

1522
01:22:35,651 --> 01:22:36,784
Enjoy yourself.

1523
01:22:36,786 --> 01:22:37,184
Come on.

1524
01:22:37,186 --> 01:22:39,620
Later, richie.

1525
01:22:39,622 --> 01:22:41,722
"richard."

1526
01:22:41,724 --> 01:22:43,190
y-yeah.

1527
01:22:43,192 --> 01:22:44,758
L-later.

1528
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:47,661
Jesus! Richie madden!
What the hell happened to him?

1529
01:22:47,663 --> 01:22:49,997
I mean, he used to be so
good-looking!

1530
01:22:49,999 --> 01:22:52,733
God, we really held up a whole
lot better than him.

1531
01:22:52,735 --> 01:22:54,201
Good job.

1532
01:22:54,203 --> 01:22:55,869
You think?
Oh, yeah.

1533
01:22:55,871 --> 01:22:58,439
Really?
Yeah.

1534
01:22:58,441 --> 01:23:00,674
Yeah. All right. Good.

1535
01:23:00,676 --> 01:23:03,344
Good. Good.

1536
01:23:03,346 --> 01:23:05,112
First of all, I want to thank

1537
01:23:05,114 --> 01:23:07,548
you, uh, all for,
uh, being here.

1538
01:23:07,550 --> 01:23:10,217
I mean, I got to admit,
at first, I was
a little freaked out.

1539
01:23:10,219 --> 01:23:14,321
I mean, you know, it's not every
day, uh, someone gets to hang

1540
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:15,323
out with themselves.

1541
01:23:15,324 --> 01:23:18,759
Literally.

1542
01:23:21,897 --> 01:23:24,732
Yeah, I was freaked out.

1543
01:23:24,734 --> 01:23:26,000
Anyway, all in all, this has

1544
01:23:26,002 --> 01:23:30,037
turned out to be one of the best
experiences of my life.

1545
01:23:30,039 --> 01:23:31,772
All right.

1546
01:23:31,774 --> 01:23:35,342
As you all know all too well,
I've been looking for love all

1547
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:38,912
my life, and the journey has
been brutal.

1548
01:23:38,914 --> 01:23:39,646
Amen to that.

1549
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:42,282
Covered a lot of territory.

1550
01:23:42,284 --> 01:23:43,283
And I just wanted to thank

1551
01:23:43,285 --> 01:23:45,185
you and let you know how much I

1552
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:47,554
appreciate and understand that

1553
01:23:47,556 --> 01:23:50,524
you all being here is to help me

1554
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:53,827
try to figure this
whole mess out.

1555
01:23:53,829 --> 01:23:55,796
Okay.

1556
01:23:56,998 --> 01:23:58,532
Who's it gonna be?

1557
01:23:58,534 --> 01:23:59,767
Who's it g...

1558
01:23:59,769 --> 01:24:01,702
uh, what do you mean?

1559
01:24:01,704 --> 01:24:03,037
Who did you pick?

1560
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:04,538
No. No, no, no.

1561
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:06,373
That is not why I called
you here.

1562
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:07,641
Well, obviously it's joanne.

1563
01:24:07,643 --> 01:24:09,743
Joanne?
You got to be kidding.

1564
01:24:09,745 --> 01:24:11,345
She's the perfect choice.

1565
01:24:11,347 --> 01:24:12,913
I mean, when joanne and I met,

1566
01:24:12,915 --> 01:24:14,248
it was love at first sight.

1567
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:16,817
Absolutely no doubt
it was meant to be.

1568
01:24:16,819 --> 01:24:17,384
Are you serious?

1569
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:20,120
I mean, joanne is great, but she
was never there for us.

1570
01:24:20,122 --> 01:24:23,190
She was the quicksilver.
You put your finger down just a

1571
01:24:23,192 --> 01:24:25,059
little too hard,
she scoots way over there.

1572
01:24:25,061 --> 01:24:28,429
Well, maybe you just didn't
give her enough of a chance.

1573
01:24:28,431 --> 01:24:30,297
Okay? I did.
That's a laugh.

1574
01:24:30,299 --> 01:24:31,098
You started this whole thing.

1575
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:34,334
Every time you guys got a little
close, you ran for the hills.

1576
01:24:34,336 --> 01:24:36,203
It'd be hard to say
who ran faster.

1577
01:24:36,205 --> 01:24:39,206
Look, man, I'm only 17.
Okay?

1578
01:24:39,208 --> 01:24:41,141
I-I-i'm not supposed
to settle down.

1579
01:24:41,143 --> 01:24:42,509
I'm supposed to sow my wild
oats.

1580
01:24:42,511 --> 01:24:45,112
You guys are the ones that are
supposed to settle down.

1581
01:24:45,114 --> 01:24:46,146
Hey, hey, hey!
Guys, guys! Guys!

1582
01:24:46,148 --> 01:24:49,683
Personally, I think we should
take another look at jocelyn.

1583
01:24:49,685 --> 01:24:51,018
Jocelyn?! no!

1584
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:53,487
No fucking way jocelyn!

1585
01:24:53,489 --> 01:24:56,190
Guys! Jakes! Please?

1586
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:57,157
No, no, seriously.
Hear me out.

1587
01:24:57,159 --> 01:25:01,328
I mean, first of all, she's the
mother of our kids.

1588
01:25:01,330 --> 01:25:03,730
Well, there's definitely
something to be said for that.

1589
01:25:03,732 --> 01:25:05,165
Hey!
Is anybody listening?

1590
01:25:05,167 --> 01:25:08,402
And when we met, it was
really love at first sight,

1591
01:25:08,404 --> 01:25:10,737
not some teenage thing.

1592
01:25:10,739 --> 01:25:11,872
No... offense.

1593
01:25:11,874 --> 01:25:12,940
Yeah, none taken.

1594
01:25:12,942 --> 01:25:16,043
But a real, full-blown, adult

1595
01:25:16,045 --> 01:25:17,744
love at first sight.

1596
01:25:17,746 --> 01:25:19,379
When I first met her, I was

1597
01:25:19,381 --> 01:25:22,182
pretty certain that she
was the one.

1598
01:25:22,184 --> 01:25:23,617
Pretty certain?

1599
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:25,552
Very... certain.

1600
01:25:25,554 --> 01:25:27,221
But that's not what you said.

1601
01:25:27,223 --> 01:25:28,555
That's what I meant.
Oh.

1602
01:25:28,557 --> 01:25:30,624
Anyway, you didn't know her 10
years later.

1603
01:25:30,626 --> 01:25:32,326
She wasn't exactly the same
person at all.

1604
01:25:32,328 --> 01:25:36,630
I can promise you, there's no
way we're going back to that.

1605
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:37,731
Tell him.

1606
01:25:37,733 --> 01:25:39,366
Tell him.

1607
01:25:39,368 --> 01:25:40,501
Uhh...

1608
01:25:40,503 --> 01:25:43,036
enh. You heard what dad said.

1609
01:25:43,038 --> 01:25:44,838
It's not too late.

1610
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:46,306
Hey, are you kidding?

1611
01:25:46,308 --> 01:25:47,808
Well, you know, it seems

1612
01:25:47,810 --> 01:25:52,679
unlikely that, uh...

1613
01:25:52,681 --> 01:25:53,514
uh...

1614
01:25:53,516 --> 01:25:55,883
just seems highly unlikely.

1615
01:25:55,885 --> 01:25:58,018
Okay, see?

1616
01:25:58,020 --> 01:25:59,153
Good.

1617
01:26:02,557 --> 01:26:04,057
What about sheryl?

1618
01:26:04,059 --> 01:26:05,893
Sheryl's the greatest.

1619
01:26:05,895 --> 01:26:08,495
She represents a mature love.

1620
01:26:08,497 --> 01:26:11,031
Now, now, I admit... jocelyn,

1621
01:26:11,033 --> 01:26:14,501
joanne were big loves, right?

1622
01:26:14,503 --> 01:26:17,804
But sheryl is something
completely different, man.

1623
01:26:17,806 --> 01:26:20,107
I mean, she is something really
special.

1624
01:26:20,109 --> 01:26:23,877
She's a sweet lady,
she's attentive,
she's compassionate,

1625
01:26:23,879 --> 01:26:26,346
she's loving, no blow-ups, no
drama.

1626
01:26:26,348 --> 01:26:28,749
That's also pretty important.
Right.

1627
01:26:28,751 --> 01:26:30,617
But the thing is, every time she
gets just a little under his

1628
01:26:30,619 --> 01:26:35,856
skin, he starts finding new ways
on why he wouldn't want
to belong to that club.

1629
01:26:35,858 --> 01:26:37,324
Y-y-you know what I mean?

1630
01:26:37,326 --> 01:26:38,526
Just, gentlemen, please.

1631
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:42,062
Could you... could I...
could I speak?

1632
01:26:42,064 --> 01:26:44,464
Can I speak?

1633
01:26:44,466 --> 01:26:46,099
Oh!

1634
01:26:46,101 --> 01:26:47,167
Beth.

1635
01:26:47,169 --> 01:26:48,068
What about beth?

1636
01:26:48,070 --> 01:26:50,404
Yeah.

1637
01:26:50,406 --> 01:26:52,439
I mean, y-you didn't know her.

1638
01:26:52,441 --> 01:26:53,840
She was after your time.

1639
01:26:53,842 --> 01:26:55,709
But beth is the greatest.

1640
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:56,276
Absolutely.

1641
01:26:56,278 --> 01:26:59,246
We've been friends for over 20
years.

1642
01:26:59,248 --> 01:27:01,081
If you knew her, you'd be crazy
about her.

1643
01:27:01,083 --> 01:27:05,385
Not to mention that she's a
great kisser, right, jake?

1644
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:09,656
Look, that sounds good,

1645
01:27:09,658 --> 01:27:11,925
but...
i mean, if something was gonna

1646
01:27:11,927 --> 01:27:14,494
happen, don't you think it
already would've happened?

1647
01:27:14,496 --> 01:27:16,029
I mean, 25 years...

1648
01:27:16,031 --> 01:27:18,198
that's a long time.

1649
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:19,900
Yeah, I suppose so.

1650
01:27:19,902 --> 01:27:23,070
Yeah, the kid's got a point.

1651
01:27:23,072 --> 01:27:24,304
Hmm.

1652
01:27:26,041 --> 01:27:27,808
Hey.

1653
01:27:29,078 --> 01:27:30,877
Hey!

1654
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:33,914
The fuck is the matter with you?
Me?

1655
01:27:33,916 --> 01:27:37,384
I mean, do you really think
that there is something wrong

1656
01:27:37,386 --> 01:27:39,152
with every single woman
in the world?

1657
01:27:39,154 --> 01:27:42,556
Or might there possibly be
something wrong with, uh...

1658
01:27:42,558 --> 01:27:45,058
I don't know...
you?

1659
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:48,195
Why are you guys blaming me?

1660
01:27:48,197 --> 01:27:51,231
Who says any of them even want
to be with me?

1661
01:27:51,233 --> 01:27:56,536
Who says
anyone would ever want
to be with me?

1662
01:27:56,538 --> 01:27:58,705
Did that ever occur to you?

1663
01:27:58,707 --> 01:28:01,708
Did that ever occur to you?

1664
01:28:01,710 --> 01:28:06,747
Man, this is a lot harder
than I thought.

1665
01:28:06,749 --> 01:28:08,715
Unbelievable.

1666
01:28:08,717 --> 01:28:11,551
Un-fucking-believable.

1667
01:28:11,553 --> 01:28:16,590
Did you ever think about
putting some color in your hair?

1668
01:28:16,592 --> 01:28:18,258
No, I mean, maybe just a little

1669
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:20,961
bit around the temples
and sideburns.

1670
01:28:20,963 --> 01:28:23,397
I mean...

1671
01:28:35,610 --> 01:28:38,578
unbelievable.
Un-fucking-believable.

1672
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:39,813
I can't believe they're
lecturing me.

1673
01:28:39,815 --> 01:28:43,617
They're the ones who always
found something wrong
with everybody.

1674
01:28:43,619 --> 01:28:44,918
One.
"oh, no, no.

1675
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:48,255
This one's too tall.
That one's too short.

1676
01:28:48,257 --> 01:28:50,724
This one's too this.
This one's too that."

1677
01:28:50,726 --> 01:28:52,726
shit! I'm the one who had
two kids.

1678
01:28:52,728 --> 01:28:54,861
I'm the one who made a
commitment!

1679
01:28:54,863 --> 01:28:55,629
Two.

1680
01:28:55,631 --> 01:28:56,897
Did it ever occur to them that
maybe searching for the right

1681
01:28:56,899 --> 01:29:01,902
one is just some kind of
unconscious, defensive thing so
I don't get hurt again?

1682
01:29:01,904 --> 01:29:03,003
It's psychological!

1683
01:29:03,005 --> 01:29:04,137
Three.
I don't know.

1684
01:29:04,139 --> 01:29:07,174
Maybe the jakes are right.
Maybe it is cheryl.

1685
01:29:07,176 --> 01:29:08,842
Four.
Sheryl's great.

1686
01:29:08,844 --> 01:29:10,911
She's beautiful.
She's smart.

1687
01:29:10,913 --> 01:29:15,349
She's always fun to be with.
Yeah.

1688
01:29:15,351 --> 01:29:16,616
Sheryl.

1689
01:29:16,618 --> 01:29:17,384
Five.

1690
01:29:17,386 --> 01:29:20,754
She has a really weird laugh.
It's kind of irritating.

1691
01:29:20,756 --> 01:29:23,056
But I can get used to that.
I can get used to that.

1692
01:29:23,058 --> 01:29:27,127
Really, I can.
I mean, she's so sweet and she's
so kind.

1693
01:29:27,129 --> 01:29:29,162
7, 8, 9, 10.

1694
01:29:33,669 --> 01:29:35,769
No, I want a
funny story.

1695
01:29:35,771 --> 01:29:36,937
Not good on point?

1696
01:29:36,939 --> 01:29:40,574
It never...
it never comes easy...

1697
01:29:41,142 --> 01:29:44,644
I can't fucking believe it.
Jake. Oh, god. Jake, no.

1698
01:29:44,646 --> 01:29:47,547
This is not what it looks like.
You did not say that.

1699
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:49,483
Come on, jake.
Don't be that way.

1700
01:29:49,485 --> 01:29:52,652
Come on. Get in the tub with us.

1701
01:29:54,822 --> 01:29:59,226
Could you believe I'm
actually gonna do this?

1702
01:30:01,162 --> 01:30:02,396
Okay.

1703
01:30:04,265 --> 01:30:05,766
How could you do this?
How could I not?

1704
01:30:05,768 --> 01:30:08,635
What'd you think...
i was gonna wait
around forever?

1705
01:30:08,637 --> 01:30:09,903
I can't fucking believe it.

1706
01:30:09,905 --> 01:30:10,537
I mean, especially now.

1707
01:30:10,539 --> 01:30:14,808
I finally f-f-figured out it's
you that I want to be with.

1708
01:30:14,810 --> 01:30:17,077
Jake. No, you don't.

1709
01:30:17,079 --> 01:30:18,945
You just
think you want me,

1710
01:30:18,947 --> 01:30:21,681
because now it looks like...

1711
01:30:21,683 --> 01:30:23,350
maybe you can't have me.

1712
01:30:23,352 --> 01:30:24,851
Now I'm a safe bet.

1713
01:30:24,853 --> 01:30:25,585
That's not true.

1714
01:30:25,587 --> 01:30:28,355
I mean, I was hoping that you'd
feel the same way.

1715
01:30:28,357 --> 01:30:32,859
Is it because he's younger
and better-looking than me?

1716
01:30:32,861 --> 01:30:36,596
I mean, my pearl?

1717
01:30:36,598 --> 01:30:37,964
Ech.

1718
01:30:37,966 --> 01:30:38,498
No.

1719
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:43,503
The fact that he's a total hunk
has nothing to do with it.

1720
01:30:43,505 --> 01:30:46,206
Jake, I love you.

1721
01:30:46,208 --> 01:30:49,810
But if I move from this side of
the tub to that side,

1722
01:30:49,812 --> 01:30:51,445
you'd immediately start
noticing all

1723
01:30:51,447 --> 01:30:54,548
the reasons why I can't possibly
be the right one.

1724
01:30:54,550 --> 01:30:57,083
No, I wouldn't.
Yes, you would.

1725
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:06,827
Look, could I... could I...
could I just say something?

1726
01:31:06,829 --> 01:31:07,794
Oh, god, how I wish you
wouldn't.

1727
01:31:07,796 --> 01:31:13,433
All right, I-i may not be a
real jake klein, okay, but I do
play one in the movies.

1728
01:31:13,435 --> 01:31:14,435
Go right ahead.

1729
01:31:14,436 --> 01:31:17,170
You don't really want to fall
in love.

1730
01:31:17,172 --> 01:31:18,405
Of course I do.
No.

1731
01:31:18,407 --> 01:31:22,509
No, what you really want...
only, you're just too ashamed
to admit it...

1732
01:31:22,511 --> 01:31:24,311
is the endless
search.

1733
01:31:24,313 --> 01:31:26,847
I mean, y-you love being free.

1734
01:31:26,849 --> 01:31:29,115
No. I don't.

1735
01:31:29,117 --> 01:31:30,617
I want to be in love.

1736
01:31:30,619 --> 01:31:32,853
I want to spend the rest of my
life with somebody.

1737
01:31:32,855 --> 01:31:35,088
That may be what you
think you want.

1738
01:31:35,090 --> 01:31:36,423
Okay, jake.

1739
01:31:36,425 --> 01:31:38,191
Why don't you tell me what I
really want?

1740
01:31:38,193 --> 01:31:42,496
You want
exactly what you

1741
01:31:42,498 --> 01:31:44,030
already have.

1742
01:31:44,032 --> 01:31:47,234
I do?
you're the master
of your destiny.

1743
01:31:47,236 --> 01:31:49,236
I'm the master of my destiny.

1744
01:31:49,238 --> 01:31:50,770
Okay, check this out.

1745
01:31:50,772 --> 01:31:51,872
You want perfect love.

1746
01:31:51,874 --> 01:31:55,041
But, poor you, you can't
find it anywhere.

1747
01:31:55,043 --> 01:31:56,776
I mean, how could you say yes to

1748
01:31:56,778 --> 01:31:59,846
this one when she doesn't have
what that one has?

1749
01:31:59,848 --> 01:32:01,248
How could you say yes to that

1750
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:02,782
one when you could meet someone

1751
01:32:02,784 --> 01:32:05,318
this afternoon and she's got
everything?

1752
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:06,453
You see what I'm saying?

1753
01:32:06,455 --> 01:32:10,056
So it's... it's the possibility
that's exciting.

1754
01:32:10,058 --> 01:32:12,259
Even at a time of life of...

1755
01:32:12,261 --> 01:32:14,060
rapidly diminishing

1756
01:32:14,062 --> 01:32:16,296
opportunities.

1757
01:32:16,298 --> 01:32:16,830
It's true.

1758
01:32:16,832 --> 01:32:20,834
Jake, look at all the other
jakes trying to make their old

1759
01:32:20,836 --> 01:32:21,668
loves fit the bill.

1760
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:24,971
But you don't want the bill
filled at all.

1761
01:32:24,973 --> 01:32:26,506
Your parents' long-term
relationship...

1762
01:32:26,508 --> 01:32:32,579
"that's what I
want," you thought, always
punishing yourself for not being

1763
01:32:32,581 --> 01:32:34,681
able to do it.

1764
01:32:34,683 --> 01:32:36,850
And the truth is, you're already

1765
01:32:36,852 --> 01:32:40,387
exactly who you're supposed
to be.

1766
01:32:40,389 --> 01:32:43,857
You're the person you designed.

1767
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:48,395
I'm the person I designed.

1768
01:32:54,268 --> 01:32:55,769
I like e.e. cummings.

1769
01:32:55,771 --> 01:32:58,572
Oh, my god.
dude, I just wanted
to say thank you.

1770
01:32:58,574 --> 01:33:01,908
Like, this has been the best
movie I've ever worked on.

1771
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:03,143
So many beautiful chicks.

1772
01:33:03,145 --> 01:33:05,946
It's just been like a
smorgasbord.

1773
01:33:05,948 --> 01:33:09,416
And sheryl.
Sheryl, she's, this one,

1774
01:33:09,418 --> 01:33:10,584
she's the keeper.
Hmm.

1775
01:33:10,586 --> 01:33:12,719
Seriously.
God, you think we'll end up

1776
01:33:12,721 --> 01:33:16,222
making one of these movies
someday?

1777
01:33:18,326 --> 01:33:24,230
I am the person I designed.

1778
01:33:34,343 --> 01:33:36,242
Ohh!

1779
01:33:36,244 --> 01:33:39,279
I am the person I designed.

1780
01:34:39,441 --> 01:34:42,475
There you have it.

1781
01:34:42,477 --> 01:34:45,045
I finally figured it out,

1782
01:34:45,047 --> 01:34:49,182
thanks to actor jake and sheryl.

1783
01:34:49,184 --> 01:34:50,884
I never was capable of falling

1784
01:34:50,886 --> 01:34:53,353
in love and being
with one person.

1785
01:34:53,355 --> 01:34:55,088
My marriage was the oddity...

1786
01:34:55,090 --> 01:34:58,958
a temporary departure from who
I really am.

1787
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:01,695
I thought I'd spent my whole

1788
01:35:01,697 --> 01:35:04,631
like looking for the one,
perfect love.

1789
01:35:04,633 --> 01:35:08,068
And it was really always about
being able to fall in love with

1790
01:35:08,070 --> 01:35:12,105
so many different qualities
in so many different people.

1791
01:35:12,107 --> 01:35:15,475
So... i created.

1792
01:35:15,477 --> 01:35:19,312
I created this situation myself.

1793
01:35:19,314 --> 01:35:23,583
Now that I realize it...

1794
01:35:23,585 --> 01:35:28,021
I can relax and be happy.

1795
01:35:35,663 --> 01:35:38,832
This is the life.

1796
01:35:38,834 --> 01:35:42,202
I think you're full of shit.

1797
01:35:42,204 --> 01:35:43,169
Not only are you full of shit,

1798
01:35:43,171 --> 01:35:46,139
but I think you're the
loneliest, most miserable fuck

1799
01:35:46,141 --> 01:35:48,541
I've ever known on the face of
the earth.

1800
01:35:48,543 --> 01:35:50,410
No, I'm not.
All you ever really wanted

1801
01:35:50,412 --> 01:35:54,314
was to fall in love with the
right person and spend the rest

1802
01:35:54,316 --> 01:35:54,981
of your days with her.

1803
01:35:54,983 --> 01:35:58,785
And I think you're despondent
that time is running out.

1804
01:35:58,787 --> 01:35:59,753
And even if you met her
today,

1805
01:35:59,755 --> 01:36:01,788
you'd only have a few,
short years together.

1806
01:36:01,790 --> 01:36:03,423
No.
And I think you're crushed.

1807
01:36:03,425 --> 01:36:07,961
I think you're crushed that the

1808
01:36:07,963 --> 01:36:10,597
possibility of a lifelong love

1809
01:36:10,599 --> 01:36:12,198
has passed you by.

1810
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:13,733
Oh, god. Man, you're wrong.

1811
01:36:13,735 --> 01:36:15,068
You're wrong. I am happy.

1812
01:36:15,070 --> 01:36:16,336
I am the master of my destiny.

1813
01:36:16,338 --> 01:36:18,271
Ah, that's a good one,
don quixote.

1814
01:36:18,273 --> 01:36:23,042
Now, listen.
don't forget...
i know.

1815
01:36:23,044 --> 01:36:25,345
Hmm?

1816
01:36:27,349 --> 01:36:30,049
You know, even if it means

1817
01:36:30,051 --> 01:36:34,921
spending the rest of your life
alone...

1818
01:36:34,923 --> 01:36:38,158
you're still not willing
to settle.

1819
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:40,693
How stupid is that?

1820
01:36:40,695 --> 01:36:42,262
Pretty damn stupid, huh?

1821
01:36:42,264 --> 01:36:43,763
You're damn right it is.

1822
01:36:43,765 --> 01:36:47,133
Pretty damn stupid.

1823
01:36:47,135 --> 01:36:49,469
Thanks a lot, asshole.

1824
01:36:49,471 --> 01:36:51,771
Pass the chips.

1825
01:36:59,013 --> 01:37:00,880
You know, I got to admit...

1826
01:37:00,882 --> 01:37:03,049
it's kind of...

1827
01:37:03,051 --> 01:37:05,485
it's kind of romantic in a,
you know,

1828
01:37:05,487 --> 01:37:08,721
bizarre, self-destructive
sort of way.

1829
01:37:08,723 --> 01:37:11,224
Really?
Yeah.

1830
01:37:11,226 --> 01:37:16,029
Maybe even a little... noble.
Really?

1831
01:37:16,031 --> 01:37:18,331
But don't tell anyone
I said that.

1832
01:37:18,333 --> 01:37:20,600
I'll deny it.

1833
01:37:24,505 --> 01:37:26,172
Don't worry.

1834
01:37:26,174 --> 01:37:30,944
At least we always have
each other.

1835
01:37:30,946 --> 01:37:32,912
You know?

1836
01:37:32,914 --> 01:37:35,114
Oy vey.

1837
01:37:35,116 --> 01:37:37,784
Should I shoot myself now?

1838
01:37:40,488 --> 01:37:43,656
Oh, man.

1839
01:39:13,748 --> 01:39:15,548
Pow.
Punch.

1840
01:39:15,550 --> 01:39:17,450
Ooh!
Bang bang.

1841
01:40:13,942 --> 01:40:15,742
Pow.
Punch.

1842
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:17,643
Ooh!
Bang bang.

1843
01:40:29,890 --> 01:40:31,724
Come here!

1844
01:40:47,608 --> 01:40:48,608
Come here!
