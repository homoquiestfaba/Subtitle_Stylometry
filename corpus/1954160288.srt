1
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,404
If he can hold this pace...

2
00:01:01,485 --> 00:01:04,807
Prefontaine will own
the NCAA indoor record.

3
00:01:14,364 --> 00:01:17,288
Here are the 5,000 meter
final results;

4
00:01:17,367 --> 00:01:21,792
First place with a new American
record, Steve Prefontaine.

5
00:01:29,779 --> 00:01:35,069
No one within 60 yards as
Pre wins his 21st straight win.

6
00:02:04,947 --> 00:02:08,599
Pre turned distance running
into a blood sport.

7
00:02:13,221 --> 00:02:16,577
You want to know what he meant
to folks around here?

8
00:02:16,657 --> 00:02:19,876
What was it the hippie kids
used to say back then?

9
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:22,077
You just had to be there.

10
00:02:43,283 --> 00:02:47,299
We raised Steve the way most
folks in Coos Bay raised their kids.

11
00:02:47,387 --> 00:02:52,871
We just tried to give him the kind of
life that we never had growing up.

12
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,747
But Steve was a
different kind of kid.

13
00:02:58,065 --> 00:03:02,286
Nine, ten, eleven, twelve...

14
00:03:02,369 --> 00:03:05,850
13, 14, 15...

15
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:08,954
16, 17, 18...

16
00:03:09,042 --> 00:03:13,228
19, 20, 21, 22...

17
00:03:13,312 --> 00:03:15,098
23, 24...

18
00:03:15,181 --> 00:03:19,402
- You go first. - It's Buck's turn.
I went first yesterday.

19
00:03:19,485 --> 00:03:21,407
That was off the
dinky little bridge.

20
00:03:21,487 --> 00:03:23,637
What's the matter?
Are you scared, Buck?

21
00:03:23,722 --> 00:03:25,644
What the hell is Pre doing?

22
00:03:25,724 --> 00:03:27,646
How'd he get up there?

23
00:03:27,726 --> 00:03:29,739
Go ahead, Pre, jump.

24
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:32,389
- Yeah. Go, Pre!
- Shut up!

25
00:03:37,369 --> 00:03:40,087
Come down, Pre, before you
get yourself killed.

26
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:53,005
- Cool!
- My God!

27
00:03:54,252 --> 00:03:57,540
Yeah! Yeah!
Whoo-hoo!

28
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,910
- You ready to play?
- Yeah!

29
00:04:00,992 --> 00:04:02,948
Okay. Dick's catcher.
Bobby, take second.

30
00:04:03,027 --> 00:04:05,916
Jimmy, center field.
Buck, you're my pitcher.

31
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:09,545
Pre.
First sub in.

32
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:11,555
Jeff, third base.
Joe, right field.

33
00:04:11,635 --> 00:04:14,251
- You'll get in, Pre.
- Let go, Buck.

34
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:16,386
Let's go, guys.

35
00:04:16,473 --> 00:04:19,431
Take the field, boys.
Let's go!

36
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:23,791
Pre did love sports, but...

37
00:04:23,881 --> 00:04:26,099
he was like, four-eight.

38
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:29,107
He weighed 90 pounds.

39
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,303
He had really shaky
hand-eye coordination.

40
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:37,915
It seemed like the
less he got to play...

41
00:04:37,994 --> 00:04:40,645
the more he felt
he had to prove.

42
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:44,382
Prefontaine!
Kickoff team!

43
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:48,563
Go get 'em, Pre!

44
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:57,293
Go, Pre, go!
Go, Pre, go!

45
00:05:50,397 --> 00:05:53,912
Once he started running,
I guess he never stopped.

46
00:06:01,942 --> 00:06:04,899
Here is Jim Ryun,
beginning to move up now...

47
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:09,460
This is the race he's been preparing for
since he was a high school sophomore.

48
00:06:09,549 --> 00:06:11,733
I'm going to Munich.

49
00:06:11,818 --> 00:06:15,606
What's that, son?

50
00:06:15,688 --> 00:06:19,579
The Munich Olympics four years
from now? I'm gonna be there.

51
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:23,243
- In Munich?
- Relax, Elfriede.

52
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:25,251
Let the boy dream.

53
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:28,915
- In Germany? - I'm goin' and
nobody's gonna stop me.

54
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:39,036
First it was football, now this.

55
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:42,365
Getting up at dawn
to run before school.

56
00:06:47,653 --> 00:06:50,440
I thought that the neighbors
must think...

57
00:06:50,522 --> 00:06:54,174
I'm a crazy German woman
to let my son do this.

58
00:06:57,229 --> 00:06:59,481
Keep your speed constant, Ellie.

59
00:06:59,564 --> 00:07:02,817
I had an itch on my gas foot.

60
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,051
He was my first real boyfriend.

61
00:07:06,137 --> 00:07:08,059
He was hot stuff.

62
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:14,088
Hey, don't kill me, now.
Come on.

63
00:07:14,178 --> 00:07:19,298
I didn't have any idea what I wanted
to do when I was growing up.

64
00:07:20,551 --> 00:07:22,473
But he knew.

65
00:07:25,956 --> 00:07:29,278
Steve, grab the level and
check this for me, will you?

66
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,647
Ray,your son sure kicked that
North Bend boy's behind last week.

67
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:37,018
- How bad you beat him?
- Not that bad. Maybe half a lap.

68
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,318
You let him off easy, Ray.

69
00:07:39,402 --> 00:07:43,088
Not my son. Okay, Steve.
Bring that two-by-four over here.

70
00:07:43,173 --> 00:07:45,994
Yeah, keep runnin, 'kid,
so you don't have to spend your life...

71
00:07:46,076 --> 00:07:50,058
shaggin' two-by-fours
for your old man.

72
00:07:50,146 --> 00:07:52,194
All right, hold it steady.

73
00:07:55,218 --> 00:07:59,166
We heard about this small kid
from Coos Bay who could run.

74
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,507
A kid we had to see.
A real fire-eater.

75
00:08:21,443 --> 00:08:24,697
After he broke all those national
high school records...

76
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,203
- college scouts came like
bees to honey. - Uh-uh.

77
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,935
Thanks, Coach.

78
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,977
Steve?

79
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,437
Steve tells me you're
quite an architect.

80
00:08:39,527 --> 00:08:43,281
No, actually,
I'm just a carpenter.

81
00:08:43,364 --> 00:08:45,286
I'll be honest with you, Ray.

82
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:49,348
Architects... they're
overrated in my book.

83
00:08:49,437 --> 00:08:52,088
Have you seen
Steve's scrapbook?

84
00:08:52,173 --> 00:08:54,459
No, ma'am.
Not, uh...

85
00:08:54,542 --> 00:08:56,999
Not lately.

86
00:08:59,946 --> 00:09:03,063
Steve!

87
00:09:10,157 --> 00:09:12,978
Hello, again, Pre.

88
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:18,179
- Where's Bowerman? - He sends his
apologies. It's hard for him to get away.

89
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:22,190
- To make the trip. - Plenty of other
head coaches have gotten away.

90
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:25,523
- Steve.
- He did ask me, though...

91
00:09:25,605 --> 00:09:28,528
to, uh... give you
a personal letter.

92
00:09:28,607 --> 00:09:30,563
That's all right.
I've got milk crates full of'em.

93
00:09:30,643 --> 00:09:33,032
Come on, son.

94
00:09:33,112 --> 00:09:36,832
Not, uh... like this one.

95
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,771
That's hot off the press.

96
00:09:39,852 --> 00:09:44,573
Dear Pre, If you want to come
to the University of Oregon...

97
00:09:44,657 --> 00:09:46,909
there's no doubt in my mind...

98
00:09:46,992 --> 00:09:49,881
you'll be the greatest
distance runner in the world.

99
00:09:49,962 --> 00:09:52,248
Please, don't wrinkle it, Steve.

100
00:09:52,331 --> 00:09:54,913
I want it for the scrapbook.

101
00:10:09,047 --> 00:10:12,164
No more war! No more war!

102
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:16,266
Hell, no! We won't go!
Hell, no! We won't go!

103
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:19,477
# Some folks are born #

104
00:10:19,557 --> 00:10:22,117
# Made to wave the flag #

105
00:10:22,193 --> 00:10:24,047
# Ooh, they're red,
white and blue #

106
00:10:24,128 --> 00:10:27,551
Any question of violence on the
University of Oregon campus...

107
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:30,919
is in the hands of President Clark and
the police department of Eugene.

108
00:10:31,001 --> 00:10:33,561
If they want violence, they will
start violence. We will not.

109
00:10:33,637 --> 00:10:36,253
I shall take what action
is necessary to end it.

110
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:39,298
Whether it's disciplinary
or police action.

111
00:10:39,376 --> 00:10:42,823
# It ain't me
It ain't me #

112
00:10:47,651 --> 00:10:51,508
# Some folks are born
silver spoon in hand #

113
00:10:54,358 --> 00:10:57,941
# But when the tax man
comes to the door #

114
00:10:58,027 --> 00:11:02,009
# Now their house looks
like a rummage sale #

115
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,851
He definitely wasn't what
anyone expected.

116
00:11:08,104 --> 00:11:10,026
It's the Beverly Hillbillies.

117
00:11:11,507 --> 00:11:13,395
You've gotta remember,
back then...

118
00:11:13,476 --> 00:11:15,899
most of the best distance
runners on the team...

119
00:11:15,978 --> 00:11:19,095
in the whole country, were these
middle-class or upper-class kids.

120
00:11:20,316 --> 00:11:22,932
Hey, guys.
Steve Prefontaine.

121
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:24,633
- Hey, I'm Mac.
- Hey, Mac.

122
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:26,675
Hi. Pat Tyson,
your roommate.

123
00:11:26,755 --> 00:11:28,677
I moved in yesterday.

124
00:11:28,757 --> 00:11:31,681
- Hi, I'm Ellie.
- Ellie Mae?

125
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,682
No,just Ellie.

126
00:11:38,466 --> 00:11:40,821
- Thomas Becker.
- That's right.

127
00:11:40,902 --> 00:11:43,860
Saw you run that 3:57.4
last summer.

128
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,700
- Personal best, right?
- Yeah.

129
00:11:47,776 --> 00:11:52,395
- Man, that was really smokin'.
- I'm flattered.

130
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,165
I'm going to beat
that time this year.

131
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:04,435
Man, if it wasn't for runnin'...

132
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:08,074
I'd be dodging bullets in 'Nam
instead of training for Munich.

133
00:12:08,162 --> 00:12:11,643
- Munich. As in Olympics?
Three years from now? - Yeah.

134
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:14,712
The only way I'm getting to Munich is
if I buy a plane ticket.

135
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:18,488
- Hey, hey, U.S.A., how many kids
did you kill today? - Look at this.

136
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:21,790
They'd be the casualties
back in Coos Bay.

137
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:25,423
Hey, hey, U.S.A., how many kids
did you kill today?

138
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:28,958
Oops.

139
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,505
Hey, Pre. The sidewalk's
over here. Pre!

140
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:41,641
- Hey!
- Peace.

141
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,767
Do you realize, Ellie,

142
00:12:51,095 --> 00:12:54,715
that I've been reading about this
place since I was in junior high?

143
00:12:54,906 --> 00:12:57,830
The road to Olympic gold.

144
00:12:57,909 --> 00:13:00,730
Track capitol, U.S.A.

145
00:13:00,812 --> 00:13:03,599
The house that Bowerman built.

146
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:10,138
You really know how
to sweet-talk a girl.

147
00:13:11,923 --> 00:13:15,438
I'll be coming down
that backstretch...

148
00:13:15,527 --> 00:13:18,416
burning all eight cylinders...

149
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:23,115
a world record in my hand,
blowing past all the competition...

150
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,715
the crowd cheering me on.

151
00:13:28,806 --> 00:13:31,491
I'll look up in the stands...

152
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:33,759
and there you'll be.

153
00:13:33,844 --> 00:13:37,268
Yeah, on my way
to the bathroom.

154
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,401
You're dead!

155
00:13:47,258 --> 00:13:50,647
- Always gotta keep me humble, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

156
00:13:53,697 --> 00:13:57,087
Which is why I'm gonna
have to marry you someday.

157
00:13:57,167 --> 00:14:00,147
Yeah. Someday.

158
00:14:01,304 --> 00:14:04,626
Someday soon.

159
00:14:05,742 --> 00:14:09,667
Did I say what field
are we on?

160
00:14:09,746 --> 00:14:13,398
Track capitol, U.S.A.

161
00:14:32,301 --> 00:14:35,281
That's right, you son of a bitch!
You'd better drive away!

162
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,123
Last goddamn time
you'll clip my box!

163
00:14:41,043 --> 00:14:44,592
- Coach Bowerman?
- Don't ever call me "coach".

164
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,261
Had an S.O.B. for a coach.

165
00:14:47,348 --> 00:14:49,327
Still hate that word
to this day.

166
00:14:51,652 --> 00:14:53,574
Um, Mr. Bowerman.

167
00:14:53,654 --> 00:14:56,134
Or "Bill" would be fine.

168
00:14:56,224 --> 00:14:58,306
Come on, rube.
Give me a hand here.

169
00:15:01,596 --> 00:15:05,783
I'm, uh...
I'm Steve Prefontaine.

170
00:15:05,867 --> 00:15:07,880
You don't say, rube.

171
00:15:14,876 --> 00:15:16,797
That's it.
Hold it right there.

172
00:15:19,613 --> 00:15:21,695
Now, what are you doin' here?

173
00:15:21,782 --> 00:15:24,171
I heard you wanted to see me.

174
00:15:24,251 --> 00:15:26,264
I mean, what are you doin'
here at the university?

175
00:15:26,353 --> 00:15:30,107
Well, you said in your letter you'd
make me the best runner in the world.

176
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:34,286
Letter. You think
I wrote you a letter?

177
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:40,947
That's dynamite.

178
00:15:42,836 --> 00:15:45,622
Uh-huh.

179
00:15:45,704 --> 00:15:48,787
Just enough to get the
bastard's attention.

180
00:16:05,457 --> 00:16:07,812
Hell of a view, wouldn't you say?

181
00:16:07,893 --> 00:16:09,906
Yeah, it's beautiful.

182
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:14,717
You know, back home
I have this...

183
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,656
this magazine with a picture of you,
and, uh...

184
00:16:18,736 --> 00:16:20,658
Stay right here.

185
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:36,068
What are you doing
out there? Bill?

186
00:16:36,154 --> 00:16:39,772
Bill! You better not have
my new waffle iron!

187
00:16:39,858 --> 00:16:41,507
Go! Go!

188
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:53,782
Why don't you go set down,
and take your shoes and socks off?

189
00:16:55,205 --> 00:16:57,184
So you want to be a miler.

190
00:16:57,274 --> 00:17:00,198
I am a miler.

191
00:17:00,277 --> 00:17:05,294
Funny thing, when I saw you in
Corvallis, you won the two-mile.

192
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:08,269
Well, I won the mile as well.

193
00:17:08,352 --> 00:17:10,934
But you set a record
in the two-mile.

194
00:17:11,021 --> 00:17:13,773
Give me your foot up here.

195
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:18,438
I'm going to run a 3:49 here
by my junior year.

196
00:17:22,164 --> 00:17:25,418
That's two seconds
under Ryun's world record.

197
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:27,856
How you gonna do that, rube?

198
00:17:27,937 --> 00:17:31,361
I'm gonna run three seconds
faster every year.

199
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:36,193
Well, then I guess we'd better
get started right away.

200
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:40,170
Tomorrow, 6:00 a. m.,
at the track.

201
00:17:46,187 --> 00:17:48,109
You mind if I ask
what you're doin'?

202
00:17:48,189 --> 00:17:50,749
No, I don't mind at all.

203
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:56,145
You son of a bitch!

204
00:17:56,231 --> 00:17:57,812
Have some of that.

205
00:18:02,237 --> 00:18:05,855
6:00 a. m., rube.
You ready to run?

206
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:08,694
- I just need a minute.
- Make sure you're stretched out.

207
00:18:08,777 --> 00:18:13,361
The reason Lord Nelson never lost a battle
was 'cause he showed up 15 minutes early.

208
00:18:13,447 --> 00:18:16,098
You'll be outta here
in less than four.

209
00:18:16,183 --> 00:18:18,663
Can't run without proper shoes.

210
00:18:37,404 --> 00:18:41,123
- Jesus, Bill.
- Hell of a pair of shoes.

211
00:18:48,181 --> 00:18:50,536
You run like a prizefighter, rube.

212
00:18:50,616 --> 00:18:52,766
You mad about somethin'?

213
00:18:52,852 --> 00:18:54,831
Am I mad about something?

214
00:18:54,921 --> 00:18:59,870
I only design 'em to last one race.
Just fell a lap short with that pair.

215
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:03,247
What was my time?

216
00:19:03,329 --> 00:19:05,251
4:03, give or take.

217
00:19:05,331 --> 00:19:07,253
Pretty good, Pre,
without competition.

218
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,482
And without shoes.

219
00:19:09,568 --> 00:19:12,753
You'll be running in the three-mile
for the team, rube.

220
00:19:12,838 --> 00:19:16,660
- What did you say? - Your kick
is not fast enough for the mile.

221
00:19:16,742 --> 00:19:18,664
I'll prove you wrong.

222
00:19:18,744 --> 00:19:22,134
Doubtful, rube.
Highly doubtful.

223
00:19:30,222 --> 00:19:32,804
Aw,Jesus, Bill.

224
00:19:32,891 --> 00:19:34,870
He'll get over it.

225
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,315
The mile was everything
back then.

226
00:19:38,396 --> 00:19:41,047
The glamour event
of track and field.

227
00:19:41,132 --> 00:19:44,317
Every kid comin' along fool enough
to take up this crazy sport...

228
00:19:44,402 --> 00:19:46,324
wanted to be the next Jim Ryun.

229
00:19:46,404 --> 00:19:49,328
Forget Jim Ryun.
He's done.

230
00:19:49,407 --> 00:19:51,921
I'm gonna be the first
Steve Prefontaine.

231
00:19:52,009 --> 00:19:55,399
It must be nice to
wanna be yourself.

232
00:19:55,479 --> 00:20:00,303
- Like I can't run with him? - Pre,
Becker's the conference mile champ.

233
00:20:04,655 --> 00:20:08,408
Watch it, freshman. There's a
no-race policy during practice.

234
00:20:08,491 --> 00:20:10,413
Fine.
Don't race me, then.

235
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,928
He's a cocky little mother.

236
00:20:36,018 --> 00:20:40,114
I'd like to bottle it and force-feed
it to the rest of you guys.

237
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:59,561
Wendy Ray. KUGN, live.

238
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:02,997
Calling the last lap of this
lively twilight meet mile.

239
00:21:07,215 --> 00:21:10,070
Pre is kicking hard
down the homestretch.

240
00:21:13,688 --> 00:21:15,838
Here comes Becker.

241
00:21:15,923 --> 00:21:19,245
It's a battle now between Becker
and the freshman phenom.

242
00:21:28,436 --> 00:21:30,757
Oregon senior Thomas
Becker wins it...

243
00:21:30,838 --> 00:21:33,852
outkicking Steve Prefontaine
down the stretch.

244
00:21:44,117 --> 00:21:46,301
Don't even say it.

245
00:21:47,787 --> 00:21:50,438
You are a damn
fine miler, rube.

246
00:21:50,524 --> 00:21:53,880
I beat him before,
I'll beat him again.

247
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,110
Oh, I know you will.

248
00:21:56,196 --> 00:21:58,118
This isn't about beating Becker.

249
00:21:58,198 --> 00:22:03,646
Becker's never gonna be the best,
and you won't settle for anything less.

250
00:22:03,736 --> 00:22:08,685
With your gas tank and your guts,
you could own the three-mile...

251
00:22:08,774 --> 00:22:10,787
make it your goddamn plaything.

252
00:22:10,876 --> 00:22:14,630
Nobody cares about
the three-mile.

253
00:22:14,713 --> 00:22:17,671
Why don't you give 'em
a reason to care?

254
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:24,476
Hey, Felix, come here.

255
00:22:34,165 --> 00:22:37,919
Back then, everyone had
either dope or beer.

256
00:22:38,002 --> 00:22:40,891
Pre's drug was winning...
at everything.

257
00:22:42,974 --> 00:22:46,262
# Out here in the field #

258
00:22:46,344 --> 00:22:48,266
# I fought for my meals #

259
00:22:48,346 --> 00:22:52,442
She's beautiful.
I love you! I love you!

260
00:22:58,856 --> 00:23:01,471
# I don't need to fight #

261
00:23:03,694 --> 00:23:06,583
# To prove I'm right #

262
00:23:09,032 --> 00:23:11,648
# I don't need to be forgiven #

263
00:23:11,735 --> 00:23:14,852
# Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah #

264
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:23,865
You're the only person
I know who'd buy a gold MG.

265
00:23:23,947 --> 00:23:26,768
What's wrong with a gold MG?

266
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,772
You've got to have a gold
medal to go with it.

267
00:23:28,852 --> 00:23:30,773
Soon enough.

268
00:23:34,257 --> 00:23:37,738
He was like a rocket breaking
free of the Earth's gravity.

269
00:23:37,827 --> 00:23:41,149
- Get down here!
- Nothing could touch him.

270
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:50,521
- Goddamn it!
- You okay?

271
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:01,399
Pre is leading the N.C.A.A. final
on a foot with ten stitches in it.

272
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:13,605
Here comes Bjorkland,
the defending three-mile champion.

273
00:24:15,563 --> 00:24:19,954
Looks like he smells blood,
and Dick Berkeley's going with him.

274
00:24:26,474 --> 00:24:29,453
The freshman, Steve Prefontaine
regains the lead.

275
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:34,201
- Go! Go! Go!
- Come on!

276
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:45,042
Steve Prefontaine is the
three-mile champion...

277
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:48,777
in one of the most electrifying
performances in a long time.

278
00:24:51,165 --> 00:24:53,178
One at a time!
One at a time!

279
00:24:53,267 --> 00:24:55,189
Pre, how'd you feel
about the race?

280
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:58,351
If I'd gone out stronger, I could have
set an American record today.

281
00:24:58,438 --> 00:25:01,327
You're disappointed?
You set an N.C.A.A. record.

282
00:25:01,407 --> 00:25:03,489
I can run better, a lot better...

283
00:25:03,576 --> 00:25:05,498
but I need better
competition to do it.

284
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,537
What about the end?
You must have had doubts...

285
00:25:09,615 --> 00:25:11,867
when Bjorkland and Berkeley
came at you like that.

286
00:25:11,951 --> 00:25:15,773
Never. What, I ran 2:00 flat
for the last two laps?

287
00:25:15,855 --> 00:25:20,838
Let me tell you something.
Nobody... nobody's gonna outkick me.

288
00:25:20,927 --> 00:25:24,818
I gotta go take care of my foot, guys.
Thanks a lot.

289
00:25:26,998 --> 00:25:29,956
That was a very impressive
performance, rube.

290
00:25:30,035 --> 00:25:31,957
I just ran my race.

291
00:25:32,037 --> 00:25:35,154
I'm talking about the way
you ran your mouth.

292
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,597
Pre, you're gonna have every runner
in the country looking to gun you down.

293
00:25:39,678 --> 00:25:41,600
Bring 'em on.

294
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,638
# I don't need to fight #

295
00:25:44,716 --> 00:25:49,267
# To prove I'm right #

296
00:25:49,354 --> 00:25:52,972
# I don't need to be forgiven #

297
00:25:53,058 --> 00:25:56,242
# Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah #

298
00:25:56,394 --> 00:25:57,873
I thought he was, basically...

299
00:25:57,962 --> 00:26:01,284
a talented little pissant
from the day I met him.

300
00:26:01,365 --> 00:26:05,290
As far as he was concerned, it was
like no one else on the team existed.

301
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:10,056
In the discus circle,
Oregon sophomore Mac Wilkins.

302
00:26:10,141 --> 00:26:13,224
- Let's go!
- All right, Mac!

303
00:26:20,885 --> 00:26:23,967
That's easily the best throw
of Wilkins'career.

304
00:26:24,053 --> 00:26:28,342
It's beyond the 190-foot mark. Should
qualify him for the Olympic Trials.

305
00:26:31,294 --> 00:26:34,741
And guess who just
entered the field?

306
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:41,384
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!

307
00:26:41,471 --> 00:26:44,395
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre!

308
00:26:44,474 --> 00:26:48,763
I started calling him "World",
short for "World Famous".

309
00:26:48,845 --> 00:26:52,268
That meet, I also
won the shot put.

310
00:26:52,347 --> 00:26:54,907
I scored ten total
points for the team.

311
00:26:56,552 --> 00:26:59,271
I mean, Pre won his race.
It was no record time or nothing.

312
00:26:59,354 --> 00:27:02,039
He scored five points.

313
00:27:02,124 --> 00:27:05,412
But did it stop him from running
three victory laps?

314
00:27:05,494 --> 00:27:08,509
Or hogging the headlines
in the papers the next day?

315
00:27:10,432 --> 00:27:12,354
It didn't matter how
many events I won.

316
00:27:12,434 --> 00:27:14,686
He always had to be the man.

317
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:17,557
- # If you get down #
- Big Mac!

318
00:27:17,639 --> 00:27:20,290
# And you get confused #

319
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:23,628
# And you don't remember #

320
00:27:23,711 --> 00:27:25,463
# Who you been talkin' to #

321
00:27:25,546 --> 00:27:27,468
- Route change.
- Pre...

322
00:27:27,548 --> 00:27:29,470
# Concentration #

323
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:32,599
A little privacy, please?

324
00:27:32,687 --> 00:27:35,542
- Hi.
- Hi.

325
00:27:35,623 --> 00:27:38,945
- I love your stride.
- Yours isn't too bad, either.

326
00:27:39,026 --> 00:27:42,177
- New on campus?
- I'm a freshman.

327
00:27:42,263 --> 00:27:44,242
- What's your name?
- Nancy Alleman.

328
00:27:44,332 --> 00:27:48,280
Steve was nothing like
I had expected him to be.

329
00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:50,347
He never even told me
who he was.

330
00:27:50,437 --> 00:27:53,224
I didn't tell you because...

331
00:27:53,306 --> 00:27:56,992
you know, I wanted you
to like me for me.

332
00:27:57,077 --> 00:27:58,556
I've heard things about you.

333
00:28:01,481 --> 00:28:05,668
Well, that's just with
guys I run against.

334
00:28:05,752 --> 00:28:07,708
I'm not that bad a guy.

335
00:28:07,787 --> 00:28:09,709
I'm sure.

336
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:12,747
So, you race the 5,000
for the girls' team?

337
00:28:12,826 --> 00:28:14,942
And the two-mile relay.

338
00:28:18,565 --> 00:28:20,486
Ever since high school.

339
00:28:22,668 --> 00:28:25,148
I could really do something with you.

340
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:27,660
What's that supposed to mean?

341
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,363
I mean as a runner.

342
00:28:34,947 --> 00:28:36,926
Ellie. Ellie, no.

343
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:39,940
The guy's car is...
It stalled.

344
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:43,671
And double-parked.
I gotta tow him.

345
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:52,449
Steve, he would lie because
he didn't want to hurt anyone.

346
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:59,257
But what he didn't realize
was that... his lying...

347
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:01,988
it hurt a hundred times worse.

348
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:05,759
You don't have to sneak around
on me anymore, Mr. Big Shot.

349
00:29:05,843 --> 00:29:09,199
This is ridiculous.
I was at the library.

350
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:14,067
Now go screw all the rich little
college girls your heart desires.

351
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:16,074
Wait a second.
Where are you goin'?

352
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:20,476
I came here for you.
Nothing else but you.

353
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:25,072
Look...
But you can't do this, Ellie.

354
00:29:26,597 --> 00:29:28,519
I'm gonna marry you.

355
00:29:47,583 --> 00:29:51,872
Less than a year later,
when he found out that I was...

356
00:29:51,954 --> 00:29:54,240
I was gonna get married
in Portland...

357
00:29:54,323 --> 00:29:57,838
he called my mother and said
that I couldn't get married...

358
00:29:57,927 --> 00:30:01,283
because he was still planning
on marrying me someday.

359
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:10,917
How many runners
we got here today?

360
00:30:12,008 --> 00:30:14,966
Hey, Pre, I'm on deadline.

361
00:30:15,044 --> 00:30:17,329
I said when I'm done.

362
00:30:17,412 --> 00:30:20,028
- What about baseball?
- Yeah.

363
00:30:20,115 --> 00:30:23,471
- See, baseball wouldn't be anything
without running, now would it? - No.

364
00:30:23,551 --> 00:30:28,067
- That's right. Anybody
like football? - Yeah.

365
00:30:28,156 --> 00:30:31,136
Football wouldn't be much
without running, now would it?

366
00:30:31,226 --> 00:30:34,616
- He always made time
for kids. - Sign mine!

367
00:30:34,696 --> 00:30:38,450
- One at a time. - He said he
saw himself in their little faces.

368
00:30:38,533 --> 00:30:41,354
- You got any fast
runners here? - Yeah!

369
00:30:41,436 --> 00:30:43,620
- You got any slowpokes?
- No!

370
00:30:43,705 --> 00:30:45,626
Ah, we'll see.

371
00:30:45,706 --> 00:30:48,527
Don't forget.
Use your upper body.

372
00:30:48,609 --> 00:30:52,193
You've gotta run with your arms,
too, not just with your legs.

373
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,102
That's better, Ricky.

374
00:30:55,182 --> 00:30:56,900
Doin' a good job.

375
00:30:56,984 --> 00:31:00,636
Hey, Speed Racer.

376
00:31:00,721 --> 00:31:03,508
You're not ready
for me yet, kid.

377
00:31:08,162 --> 00:31:10,084
Steve, for the rest of his life...

378
00:31:10,164 --> 00:31:13,951
that little kid would have remembered
the day Steve Prefontaine let him win.

379
00:31:14,033 --> 00:31:18,549
Oh, you can't let a losing mentality
creep in here... ever.

380
00:31:18,638 --> 00:31:23,359
A losing mentality? Against a
nine-year-old? Are you serious?

381
00:31:25,378 --> 00:31:28,358
How do you think
I got this far, Nance?

382
00:31:28,448 --> 00:31:30,871
What do you mean?

383
00:31:33,586 --> 00:31:35,736
Well...

384
00:31:35,822 --> 00:31:37,870
do I look like a runner?

385
00:31:37,957 --> 00:31:40,812
No, you look like
a hammer thrower.

386
00:31:42,594 --> 00:31:45,245
Look at you.

387
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,480
You've got long legs...

388
00:31:47,566 --> 00:31:51,991
a great stride,
you're tall, slender.

389
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,550
You're built like a runner, not me.

390
00:31:54,639 --> 00:31:56,652
Steve.

391
00:31:57,776 --> 00:32:01,325
So, what have I got going for me?

392
00:32:04,116 --> 00:32:08,166
Why does some kid
from Coos Bay...

393
00:32:08,253 --> 00:32:12,302
with one leg shorter than
the other win races?

394
00:32:14,825 --> 00:32:17,714
Let me tell you somethin'.

395
00:32:17,795 --> 00:32:22,118
All of my life people
have said to me...

396
00:32:22,199 --> 00:32:24,713
"You're too small, Pre. "

397
00:32:24,802 --> 00:32:27,726
"You're not fast enough, Pre. "

398
00:32:28,806 --> 00:32:31,957
"Give up your foolish
dreams, Steve. "

399
00:32:34,044 --> 00:32:37,161
But you know what?
They forgot somethin'.

400
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:39,671
I have to win.

401
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:45,039
There's no fallback here. No
great stride, no long legs! Nothing!

402
00:32:53,463 --> 00:32:55,419
I'm sorry.

403
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,517
Steve, from the moment I saw you...

404
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,992
you looked like the
best runner ever.

405
00:33:07,844 --> 00:33:12,359
He always had a great need,
ya know.

406
00:33:12,447 --> 00:33:15,268
I mean, just...
just an endless need...

407
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,773
that came from somewhere.

408
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,178
I'm not thinkin' about
makin' the team.

409
00:33:55,256 --> 00:33:57,304
I'm thinkin' about gold in Munich.

410
00:34:07,235 --> 00:34:10,214
What's on the training table
this morning, Galloway?

411
00:34:10,303 --> 00:34:12,658
Hot dogs again.

412
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:15,321
Breakfast of champions.

413
00:34:18,178 --> 00:34:20,430
Oh, man.

414
00:34:31,157 --> 00:34:33,307
This is bullshit, Frank.

415
00:34:33,393 --> 00:34:36,180
And we're paying for these
wonderful accommodations too.

416
00:34:36,263 --> 00:34:39,880
I met a runner who had to hock his
trophies to pay for his plane ticket.

417
00:34:39,965 --> 00:34:43,116
You'd think they'd at least put
guys up once they got here.

418
00:34:43,202 --> 00:34:45,124
Au contraire, the A.T.U.
and the Olympic committee...

419
00:34:45,204 --> 00:34:47,456
are dedicated to preserving
our amateur virginity.

420
00:34:47,539 --> 00:34:49,587
That's so screwed up.

421
00:34:49,675 --> 00:34:51,893
Somebody ought
to do something.

422
00:34:59,885 --> 00:35:02,001
Frank Shorter is going to Munich!

423
00:35:02,087 --> 00:35:05,011
He'll be our top qualifier
in the 10,000 meters.

424
00:35:08,293 --> 00:35:12,184
Are you paying for your suite
at the Hyatt, Curtis?

425
00:35:12,263 --> 00:35:14,515
Is Dick here sleeping
on your floor?

426
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:16,521
You're mixing apples
and oranges, Bill.

427
00:35:16,601 --> 00:35:19,286
We couldn't afford to put the
athletes up even if we wanted to.

428
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:22,794
That's right. Gotta save back some of
those millions you got in the treasury...

429
00:35:22,874 --> 00:35:26,696
so you can send over 100 officials
to Munich in style.

430
00:35:26,778 --> 00:35:28,325
Luckily for you,
your opinions on that...

431
00:35:28,413 --> 00:35:31,496
were overlooked by the selection
committee this year.

432
00:35:31,582 --> 00:35:36,666
Your job is to coach the
team on the track. Period.

433
00:35:36,753 --> 00:35:38,937
Understand?

434
00:35:39,022 --> 00:35:42,640
Maybe I'll have the university
hold back the gate receipts.

435
00:35:42,726 --> 00:35:45,012
Let a court decide
this situation.

436
00:35:45,095 --> 00:35:48,610
No, no.

437
00:35:48,699 --> 00:35:51,315
No, you've got a choice.

438
00:35:51,401 --> 00:35:53,790
You can take us to court...

439
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:56,725
or you can take the
team to Munich.

440
00:35:56,807 --> 00:35:58,923
What's it gonna be, Bill?

441
00:36:05,614 --> 00:36:08,970
Wilkins up. James on deck.
Gilbert in the hole.

442
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:24,217
Wilkins' final throw,
175 feet, four inches.

443
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,222
He remains in 12th place.

444
00:36:30,139 --> 00:36:33,528
First call for the 5,000 meter final.

445
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,656
All competitors,
please report to the clerk.

446
00:36:35,744 --> 00:36:39,566
- New and improved.
- Still no one-piece toe?

447
00:36:39,647 --> 00:36:42,468
That's harder than you think.
Nobody makes them one-piece.

448
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:45,007
These homemade seams are
gonna give me big-time blisters.

449
00:36:45,086 --> 00:36:47,668
Give me the damn shoes back.

450
00:36:47,756 --> 00:36:52,341
Give 'em back! Last damn thing I need
is you out there thinking about shoes.

451
00:36:52,427 --> 00:36:55,078
One-piece toe! When's
the last time you ate?

452
00:36:55,163 --> 00:36:58,314
It doesn't matter. It's all
over there in that trash can.

453
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,221
- You okay?
- I'm all right.

454
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:04,418
It's weird.

455
00:37:04,505 --> 00:37:08,487
Here I am,just a race away
from making it to Munich...

456
00:37:08,575 --> 00:37:11,692
and suddenly my legs
feel like logs.

457
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,996
That's just nerves.

458
00:37:15,082 --> 00:37:18,597
Think of how nervous Young
is trying to slay you...

459
00:37:18,685 --> 00:37:21,836
a fire-breathing dragon
in your own backyard.

460
00:37:21,922 --> 00:37:27,212
You are going to burn his ass up.

461
00:37:27,361 --> 00:37:32,514
In lane one, bronze medalist
in the '68 Olympics...

462
00:37:32,598 --> 00:37:35,681
the legend, the veteran,
George Young.

463
00:37:42,175 --> 00:37:46,862
In lane two, Washington State's great
four-time N.C.A.A. champion...

464
00:37:46,946 --> 00:37:49,699
Jerry Lindgren.

465
00:37:57,356 --> 00:37:59,335
Boo!

466
00:38:02,527 --> 00:38:06,384
And in lane three, a junior
from the University of Oregon...

467
00:38:06,465 --> 00:38:09,480
three-time N.C.A.A. champion...

468
00:38:09,568 --> 00:38:13,584
American record holder
in the 5,000 meters...

469
00:38:13,672 --> 00:38:17,893
never defeated at Hayward Field,
Steve Prefontaine!

470
00:38:30,754 --> 00:38:33,177
Lap ten of a very fast 5,000.

471
00:38:34,558 --> 00:38:37,072
The race now is between
Pre and Young.

472
00:38:46,904 --> 00:38:48,952
Pre takes the lead!

473
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:51,462
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!

474
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:55,694
Can the kid break the veteran? One of
the guttiest runners in track history.

475
00:39:03,386 --> 00:39:07,072
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!

476
00:39:08,258 --> 00:39:10,818
Little son of a gun's
goin' for the record.

477
00:39:12,362 --> 00:39:14,375
- Kick! Kick! Kick! Kick! Kick!
- Go for it! Go for it!

478
00:39:35,984 --> 00:39:38,839
Prefontaine misses
the world record...

479
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:42,140
but shatters his own American
record by seven seconds.

480
00:39:50,032 --> 00:39:52,683
Congratulations.
You did it.

481
00:39:52,768 --> 00:39:54,690
We did it.

482
00:39:56,037 --> 00:39:58,892
You still think nobody cares
about the three-mile?

483
00:40:04,579 --> 00:40:07,503
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!

484
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:13,340
I never understood,
son, why you ran.

485
00:40:13,421 --> 00:40:16,743
Now she's a nervous wreck as
soon as you come on to the field.

486
00:40:16,824 --> 00:40:20,578
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!

487
00:40:48,688 --> 00:40:53,580
Steve Prefontaine has capped an impressive
week for American track and field.

488
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,480
Prefontaine celebrates
his 21 st victory today.

489
00:40:56,562 --> 00:41:00,350
Pre has won the 5,000, the glamour
event of these Olympic Trials.

490
00:41:00,432 --> 00:41:04,528
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!

491
00:41:13,912 --> 00:41:16,494
It was like long ago
Steve had begun...

492
00:41:16,582 --> 00:41:20,632
this incredible dance with
the press and his fans.

493
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:24,575
Now the music was playing
faster and faster.

494
00:41:24,656 --> 00:41:26,578
How you feelin', Pre?

495
00:41:26,658 --> 00:41:28,637
- I'm feelin' very late.
- Are you ready?

496
00:41:28,726 --> 00:41:32,913
- Ready for what? - Come on, Pre.
You're always good for a quote.

497
00:41:32,997 --> 00:41:36,216
Pre, the experts say you're just a
21-year-old, inexperienced kid...

498
00:41:36,301 --> 00:41:38,587
who's never faced the
top European runners.

499
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:42,527
Hey, Pre, how do you expect to beat
the best in the world on their turf?

500
00:41:42,607 --> 00:41:45,861
I'm going to run the last mile
under four minutes...

501
00:41:45,943 --> 00:41:47,956
and I dare anybody
to stay with me.

502
00:41:48,046 --> 00:41:51,902
That's crazy!

503
00:41:51,982 --> 00:41:55,065
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!

504
00:41:59,256 --> 00:42:02,111
I guess this is good-bye.

505
00:42:07,798 --> 00:42:12,223
I've been dreamin' about this for
so long. Tell me it's really happening.

506
00:42:12,302 --> 00:42:15,123
Look, Steve,
I want you to know...

507
00:42:15,205 --> 00:42:17,457
you're more than
just my boyfriend.

508
00:42:17,541 --> 00:42:20,362
You're my hero too.

509
00:42:20,444 --> 00:42:22,866
I know you're gonna kick ass.

510
00:42:22,945 --> 00:42:26,130
What if I don't?

511
00:42:34,223 --> 00:42:36,145
I don't want to go.

512
00:42:38,394 --> 00:42:40,646
I'm scared.

513
00:43:00,682 --> 00:43:04,869
Only these people will
ever see this live...

514
00:43:04,953 --> 00:43:10,175
but you, along with almost
a billion other people...

515
00:43:10,258 --> 00:43:13,147
are seeing it on television.

516
00:43:13,228 --> 00:43:15,913
Okay, they just cued the doves.
Here they come.

517
00:43:15,997 --> 00:43:18,648
There go the Bavarian doves,
5,000 of them.

518
00:43:18,733 --> 00:43:21,121
They've dubbed this Olympiad...

519
00:43:21,201 --> 00:43:23,658
the "Serene Olympics".

520
00:43:23,737 --> 00:43:26,558
Those are the symbolic colors
of these Olympics...

521
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,655
instead of the Nazi banners
that flew here the last time.

522
00:43:29,743 --> 00:43:34,362
And here they come,
the United States of America.

523
00:43:34,448 --> 00:43:36,370
Great uniforms this year,
aren't they?

524
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:38,372
Look.

525
00:43:38,452 --> 00:43:42,434
There's Steve Prefontaine, one of
America's best hopes for a gold medal.

526
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:46,213
And there's Art Walker,
the triple jumper.

527
00:43:46,293 --> 00:43:49,807
- You guys see that Swedish long jumper?
- What do you think, I'm blind?

528
00:43:49,896 --> 00:43:54,151
She sure wasn't. The way she was checking
out every guy in the U.S. delegation.

529
00:43:54,233 --> 00:43:57,248
- For real? God bless America.
- That's right.

530
00:43:57,336 --> 00:44:01,432
- Goodbye.
- # Oh, say can you see #

531
00:44:01,507 --> 00:44:04,158
- Identification. Identification.
- # By the dawn's early light #

532
00:44:04,243 --> 00:44:08,464
- # By the twilight's last gleam... #
- Give it up, Galloway.

533
00:44:08,548 --> 00:44:11,108
If you get on the medal stand,
just move your lips.

534
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:16,505
Home sweet home.

535
00:44:17,956 --> 00:44:20,811
What did they have, 5,000 doves?

536
00:44:20,892 --> 00:44:24,214
800 dancing girls?

537
00:44:24,296 --> 00:44:27,015
At least we know what they
spent their money on.

538
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,422
Look on the bright side, guys.

539
00:44:30,502 --> 00:44:33,153
To clean it, all we
need is a fire hose.

540
00:44:33,238 --> 00:44:35,160
Jesus.

541
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:30,505
Mark Spitz has the lead. Here
comes Hayden Locke in the middle.

542
00:45:30,593 --> 00:45:33,517
Over here in lane eight,
it's John Murphy, putting on a sprint.

543
00:45:33,596 --> 00:45:36,053
John Murphy coming hard
in lane eight.

544
00:45:36,132 --> 00:45:41,650
Murphy's after Spitz! It's too late.
The winner is Mark Spitz! He's got six!

545
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:45,025
And he's got a new world
and Olympic record.

546
00:45:45,107 --> 00:45:49,123
There is time for the Russians to go
to their big man, Alexander Belov.

547
00:45:49,211 --> 00:45:51,133
They're going to try.

548
00:45:53,615 --> 00:45:56,539
Alexander Belov!
And this time it is over.

549
00:45:58,487 --> 00:46:02,071
First it was indicated
the U.S. had won 49-48.

550
00:46:02,157 --> 00:46:04,079
That looks like the final score...

551
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:06,810
although there is a big rhubarb
going on in front of the bench.

552
00:46:09,631 --> 00:46:12,953
No, no, no.
I'm serious. Come on.

553
00:46:13,034 --> 00:46:16,959
Guys who are trying to double up
on the 5,000 and 10,000?

554
00:46:17,038 --> 00:46:19,518
Bedford? Yifter? Lasse Viren?

555
00:46:19,607 --> 00:46:21,529
I'm not worried about them.

556
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:26,225
- The race is in the bag.
- Shh.

557
00:46:26,314 --> 00:46:29,738
What the hell are
you drinkin', Pre?

558
00:46:29,817 --> 00:46:33,366
Last I looked, Bedford was
the world record holder.

559
00:46:33,454 --> 00:46:36,742
Viren just set a world record in
the two-mile last month.

560
00:46:36,824 --> 00:46:41,750
Viren's been running
good races, true. True.

561
00:46:41,829 --> 00:46:45,184
But when I make my move
with a mile to go...

562
00:46:45,265 --> 00:46:47,415
it's gonna be "whoosh"!

563
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:51,015
And those guy's will feel
like they hit a stone wall.

564
00:46:51,104 --> 00:46:53,186
"Whoosh"?

565
00:46:54,441 --> 00:46:57,262
"Whoosh".

566
00:46:57,344 --> 00:47:00,302
Frank Shorter of the United
States is still hanging back.

567
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:05,135
You're watching the 10,000 meter final
live on a beautiful sunny day in Munich.

568
00:47:06,252 --> 00:47:08,174
There goes Viren, down.

569
00:47:08,254 --> 00:47:11,734
- Gammoudi trips over him and falls
off the track. - Man. Tough break.

570
00:47:11,824 --> 00:47:14,907
Not for Shorter!

571
00:47:14,994 --> 00:47:17,383
Come on, Frank.
Time to make your move.

572
00:47:17,463 --> 00:47:20,443
Don't count Viren out yet.

573
00:47:20,532 --> 00:47:22,454
...less than three laps to go.

574
00:47:22,534 --> 00:47:23,392
Amazing!

575
00:47:23,695 --> 00:47:27,607
After falling, Viren has quickly rejoined
the pack and is now moving into fifth.

576
00:47:27,642 --> 00:47:32,695
- Jesus, what a talent. - Yeah,
it's the best that money can buy.

577
00:47:32,778 --> 00:47:34,928
What's that supposed to mean?

578
00:47:35,014 --> 00:47:37,869
He's like a lot of
the top Europeans.

579
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:41,806
He's got a fake government job that
doesn't cut into his training regime.

580
00:47:41,886 --> 00:47:45,538
Got an entourage of doctors
and trainers wherever he goes.

581
00:47:47,558 --> 00:47:52,643
But they're not athletes over here, man.
It's like they're national treasures.

582
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:56,848
I don't know. Looks like
a goddamn stallion to me.

583
00:47:56,934 --> 00:47:59,823
And now, after six miles,
here they go.

584
00:47:59,904 --> 00:48:02,919
Passing slower runners.
The three of them going for the gold.

585
00:48:03,007 --> 00:48:06,955
This is unbelievable.

586
00:48:07,045 --> 00:48:09,365
- He's going after the record.
- The Finnish flag's still flying.

587
00:48:09,446 --> 00:48:13,633
Here comes Puttemans after Viren.

588
00:48:13,717 --> 00:48:15,969
Look at Viren accelerate.

589
00:48:16,053 --> 00:48:19,011
And Viren's going to hold it!

590
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,720
Lasse Viren the winner, 27:38.

591
00:48:25,796 --> 00:48:30,221
That breaks the world record
of 27:39.4...

592
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,985
By about half a second.

593
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:35,686
I'll tell you, Jim, there's
one man in these stands...

594
00:48:35,772 --> 00:48:39,628
that had better be worried having watched
this race, and that's Steve Prefontaine.

595
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:44,032
The world record of Ron Clarke had stood
since 1965. There was Frank Shannon.

596
00:48:44,113 --> 00:48:48,436
Look at this. Here's
a bit of real Olympia.

597
00:48:48,517 --> 00:48:52,271
A kid, a blond-haired boy with the
Finnish flag leaping over the barrier...

598
00:48:54,156 --> 00:48:56,078
Viren!

599
00:49:01,731 --> 00:49:03,653
Look.

600
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,222
Hey, Pre, come here,
quick. I need you.

601
00:49:15,376 --> 00:49:18,197
God, he makes other guys look like
they're standin' still.

602
00:49:18,279 --> 00:49:22,101
Exactly. Stand still.
Don't move.

603
00:49:22,183 --> 00:49:26,233
To folks up there watchin', it's just
America's greatest distance runner...

604
00:49:26,321 --> 00:49:28,937
conferring with his two coaches.

605
00:49:29,023 --> 00:49:32,777
Down here, it's you two guys
covering me while I take a leak.

606
00:49:32,861 --> 00:49:36,546
- This isn't Eugene, Bill.
- I need a new race plan.

607
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:40,111
- Relax, rube.
- Goddamn it, Bill. I'm serious.

608
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,852
Look, if you were running
the 400 against Viren...

609
00:49:43,937 --> 00:49:46,417
we could all join hands about
now and have a good cry.

610
00:49:46,507 --> 00:49:49,522
You're runnin'the 5,000.

611
00:49:51,345 --> 00:49:55,668
Listen to me, rube. On Saturday,
his posse won't mean squat.

612
00:49:55,749 --> 00:49:59,503
Bedford'll go out fast,
and you'll stay right on his butt.

613
00:49:59,586 --> 00:50:03,682
By the time you get ready to take over,
Viren's legs will be crap.

614
00:50:03,757 --> 00:50:08,546
The only kick he'll have left is the one
you give him in the ass on your way by.

615
00:50:23,784 --> 00:50:26,207
Look at Viren accelerate!

616
00:50:26,286 --> 00:50:28,436
And Viren's going to hold it!

617
00:50:28,522 --> 00:50:31,673
That breaks the world
record of 27:39...

618
00:51:25,443 --> 00:51:27,365
Hello?

619
00:51:27,445 --> 00:51:30,027
Hello. Is this the U.S. complex?
Please, is this...

620
00:51:30,114 --> 00:51:33,867
- Who the hell is this? - Shaoul Adami.
Something horrible is happening.

621
00:51:33,951 --> 00:51:36,533
I know it. Please.
I need your help.

622
00:51:39,256 --> 00:51:42,737
- What's going on? Where are you?
- I need you. Run! No!

623
00:51:42,826 --> 00:51:45,750
Run! No! No!

624
00:51:45,829 --> 00:51:48,514
- No!
- Hello? Hello?

625
00:51:54,972 --> 00:51:59,454
I've got an extreme emergency. Get me a
number inside of the American Embassy.

626
00:51:59,543 --> 00:52:01,794
Right away, damn it!
Do it now!

627
00:52:09,485 --> 00:52:12,136
This is an I.T.N. news flash...

628
00:52:12,221 --> 00:52:15,372
from the Olympic Village in Munich,
where Arab gunmen...

629
00:52:15,458 --> 00:52:18,018
The peace of what have been
called the "Serene Olympics"...

630
00:52:18,094 --> 00:52:20,574
was shattered just before
dawn this morning...

631
00:52:26,736 --> 00:52:30,024
Arriving passengers,
do not be alarmed.

632
00:52:30,106 --> 00:52:34,030
- American killed him?
- No, Israeli.

633
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:37,966
Arab terrorists went to the
headquarters of the Israeli team...

634
00:52:38,046 --> 00:52:41,493
and immediately killed one man,
Moshe Weinberg, a coach.

635
00:52:41,583 --> 00:52:44,234
Two shots in the head,
one in the stomach.

636
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:47,038
The guerillas are demanding
the release...

637
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:50,569
of 250 Arabs held
prisoner in Israel...

638
00:52:50,659 --> 00:52:53,583
and have set noon as the
deadline for their release.

639
00:52:53,662 --> 00:52:56,142
They had set a deadline of noon...

640
00:52:56,231 --> 00:52:59,052
saying that they were going to kill
all of their hostages at that time.

641
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:01,249
That deadline, obviously, has passed.

642
00:53:01,335 --> 00:53:04,816
There are men with guns
beginning to train those guns...

643
00:53:04,905 --> 00:53:07,825
on the rooms where the two heads
were sticking out a moment ago

644
00:53:08,082 --> 00:53:09,943
of the Arab guerilla lookouts.

645
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:13,334
- One man with binoculars...
- Has anybody here seen Mark Spitz?

646
00:53:13,414 --> 00:53:16,099
- No. - Where in
the hell is Spitz?

647
00:53:16,183 --> 00:53:19,163
How many Jewish athletes
do we have on the team?

648
00:53:19,253 --> 00:53:22,609
This is happening now,
if you can possibly believe that.

649
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:26,205
A crowd estimated
at 75,000 to 80,000 people...

650
00:53:26,293 --> 00:53:29,216
has gathered, awaiting
the outcome of this.

651
00:53:29,295 --> 00:53:33,686
Here are the men with what appear to be,
I suppose, submachine guns.

652
00:53:33,766 --> 00:53:38,055
These are the Germans. They are
the men trying to free the Israelis.

653
00:54:02,628 --> 00:54:05,552
They suspended the Games.

654
00:54:05,631 --> 00:54:08,555
Burke just told us.

655
00:54:08,634 --> 00:54:13,492
I guess murdered athletes
don't make for good sport.

656
00:54:13,572 --> 00:54:18,498
It's the right thing to do.
We should all go home now.

657
00:54:18,577 --> 00:54:20,761
Oh, I don't know.

658
00:54:20,846 --> 00:54:25,829
I know this is awful to say, 'cause
I feel terribly for those guys over there...

659
00:54:25,917 --> 00:54:30,671
but right now all I can think about
is how hard I've worked to get here.

660
00:54:30,755 --> 00:54:33,337
I feel ripped off, man.

661
00:54:33,424 --> 00:54:35,745
Is that where you're at, Pre?

662
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:54,128
It's dark. It's 23 minutes
past 7:00 in the evening...

663
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:57,691
and inside that little block
are ten Israelis,

664
00:54:57,781 --> 00:54:59,703
one of them believed dead...

665
00:54:59,783 --> 00:55:02,536
the other nine said to
be standing in a circle...

666
00:55:02,619 --> 00:55:05,179
hands tied behind their back
and lashed to each other...

667
00:55:11,294 --> 00:55:13,216
Come on, Pre.

668
00:55:17,233 --> 00:55:20,316
Grab your stuff. You're
staying with me tonight.

669
00:55:28,844 --> 00:55:30,994
Steve! Steve!

670
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,002
Steve!

671
00:55:33,082 --> 00:55:35,334
- I'm okay.
- I was so worried.

672
00:55:35,417 --> 00:55:37,874
On the plane it was
so awful, so awful.

673
00:55:37,953 --> 00:55:40,433
The guards won't let us in.
Oh, Steve!

674
00:55:43,592 --> 00:55:46,914
It's all right.
I'm okay.

675
00:55:46,995 --> 00:55:49,919
Pre, can you give us a sense
of the mood inside...

676
00:55:49,998 --> 00:55:53,252
Goddamn it!
Leave me alone!

677
00:55:53,335 --> 00:55:55,723
PeterJennings here in
the Olympic Village.

678
00:55:55,803 --> 00:55:59,159
One of the helicopters now proceeds
out over the Olympic site.

679
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:05,632
You cannot exit this gate.
You must leave the area immediately.

680
00:56:05,713 --> 00:56:08,864
I'm sorry. I gotta get him out of here.
He'll be staying with me.

681
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:11,839
I'll call you at the hotel, Mom.

682
00:56:11,919 --> 00:56:14,843
The Israeli hostages and
the Arab commandos...

683
00:56:14,922 --> 00:56:17,971
who have held them hostage
for this entire day...

684
00:56:18,415 --> 00:56:19,967
have now left,

685
00:56:20,314 --> 00:56:23,379
gone to a makeshift helicopter pad
at the back of the Olympic Village.

686
00:56:43,283 --> 00:56:46,036
I've just been told that
the German police...

687
00:56:46,119 --> 00:56:49,008
thought they had
the Arabs isolated...

688
00:56:49,089 --> 00:56:52,012
opened fire on them,
whereupon, reportedly...

689
00:56:52,091 --> 00:56:55,049
the Arabs threw a hand
grenade into the helicopter...

690
00:56:55,127 --> 00:56:58,415
- Ohhh. - blowing up the helicopter
and killing all the hostages.

691
00:56:58,497 --> 00:57:02,046
All of the hostages are dead.

692
00:57:02,134 --> 00:57:06,082
- Most of the Arabs are dead, three of
them are in hospitals, - What happened?

693
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:08,857
and one of them may
still be on the loose.

694
00:57:08,941 --> 00:57:12,661
It's over.
Everybody's dead.

695
00:57:12,745 --> 00:57:15,100
They're all gone.

696
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:18,105
The Israeli Olympic team
is destroyed...

697
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:21,107
much of it, some of their officials.

698
00:57:21,186 --> 00:57:24,633
But what will happen to the
Games of the 20th Olympiad?

699
00:57:24,722 --> 00:57:29,477
None of us know what will happen
to the course of world history.

700
00:57:57,754 --> 00:58:00,769
I know this is hard, but you
gotta put this behind you.

701
00:58:00,858 --> 00:58:04,680
Behind me?
The Games are over.

702
00:58:04,761 --> 00:58:07,480
- The Games will resume.
- Yeah, right.

703
00:58:09,099 --> 00:58:11,750
They'll resume, and they'll
run the 5,000 meters.

704
00:58:11,835 --> 00:58:14,486
So what?
I'm not running.

705
00:58:14,571 --> 00:58:16,493
Calm down.

706
00:58:16,573 --> 00:58:18,620
Calm down?

707
00:58:18,708 --> 00:58:21,962
Come on.
Can't you see?

708
00:58:22,044 --> 00:58:24,968
It's all ruined now.

709
00:58:25,047 --> 00:58:28,198
With the "Happy Games. "
What a joke!

710
00:58:28,284 --> 00:58:31,435
I've been dreaming about
this since I was 16.

711
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,444
This is not how it's
supposed to be!

712
00:58:34,523 --> 00:58:37,242
They'll start back up
tomorrow or the day after.

713
00:58:37,326 --> 00:58:40,511
That's great. Great.

714
00:58:40,596 --> 00:58:43,485
That's just great.

715
00:58:45,401 --> 00:58:47,686
Over the dead bodies
of those athletes...

716
00:58:47,769 --> 00:58:49,987
we're gonna go on like
nothing happened.

717
00:58:50,071 --> 00:58:52,687
Run races and salute the flag!

718
00:58:52,774 --> 00:58:54,696
Pre, look at me.

719
00:58:54,776 --> 00:58:58,223
You think that Viren and Yifter
and Bedford are talking like this?

720
00:58:58,313 --> 00:59:01,828
You think they're wringing their hands
and packing their bags over this thing?

721
00:59:01,917 --> 00:59:04,431
They came here to win
a goddamn race!

722
00:59:04,519 --> 00:59:07,943
Now, maybe Viren's a sensitive
humanitarian back in Finland...

723
00:59:08,023 --> 00:59:11,447
but right now I'll bet there's a
little voice in his head, saying...

724
00:59:11,526 --> 00:59:15,451
"Hey, I just got an extra day's rest
for the 5,000. "

725
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:18,953
An extra day's rest?

726
00:59:19,033 --> 00:59:21,547
That's not fair.

727
00:59:21,635 --> 00:59:23,557
- Pre, listen...
- Wait a second!

728
00:59:23,637 --> 00:59:27,152
- They can't let any of the 10,000 guys
off the hook... - Pre, listen to me!

729
00:59:27,241 --> 00:59:29,892
Now, you've got to
keep your focus!

730
00:59:29,977 --> 00:59:32,229
You're running phenomenal
intervals right now...

731
00:59:32,313 --> 00:59:35,396
and believe me,
those guys know it too.

732
00:59:35,482 --> 00:59:39,373
They're afraid of you.
Don't be afraid of them.

733
00:59:40,888 --> 00:59:43,903
I'm not afraid of them.

734
00:59:43,991 --> 00:59:46,470
I'm not afraid of anybody.

735
00:59:49,662 --> 00:59:52,313
One day away from the biggest
race in your life...

736
00:59:52,398 --> 00:59:54,650
what's going through your mind?

737
00:59:54,734 --> 00:59:57,521
I just want to run my race
and get it over with.

738
00:59:57,603 --> 00:59:59,787
Still predicting victory?

739
00:59:59,872 --> 01:00:01,988
Pre?

740
01:00:02,075 --> 01:00:04,691
I'm just doing the best I can.

741
01:00:06,145 --> 01:00:08,898
The basketball federation
has upheld...

742
01:00:08,982 --> 01:00:12,167
Russia's controversial
victory in basketball.

743
01:00:12,251 --> 01:00:15,208
Things continue to go downhill
for the United States in Munich.

744
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:38,526
All competitors for the 5,000 meter
race,your event is next.

745
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:43,536
Make sure your numbers are visible on
the front of jersey and right hip of shorts.

746
01:00:43,615 --> 01:00:48,233
Make sure your numbers are clearly visible
on front of jersey and right hip of shorts.

747
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:52,369
Officials will check your number
at the entrance to the stadium.

748
01:01:01,966 --> 01:01:05,720
Go, Pre!
Go, Pre!

749
01:01:05,803 --> 01:01:09,091
This unquestionably,
I would say, Erich...

750
01:01:09,173 --> 01:01:11,391
is the quality field
of the Olympics.

751
01:01:11,475 --> 01:01:14,921
There are, perhaps, seven,
eight, nine or ten men in this field...

752
01:01:15,011 --> 01:01:17,935
that could easily take
the gold medal.

753
01:01:18,014 --> 01:01:21,836
Prefontaine told me the other night,
or about a week ago...

754
01:01:21,918 --> 01:01:25,843
"What I'm gonna try to do is work it out
so it'll be a pure guts race at the end...

755
01:01:25,922 --> 01:01:28,846
and if it is, I'm the only
one who can win. "

756
01:01:35,765 --> 01:01:38,814
I'd like to make this statement;
I think Steve Prefontaine...

757
01:01:38,902 --> 01:01:41,257
will be the Olympic
5,000 meter champion.

758
01:01:42,671 --> 01:01:45,458
I think he will break the world's
record at 5,000 meters...

759
01:01:45,541 --> 01:01:48,465
but I think he will have
to do it in Montreal.

760
01:01:48,544 --> 01:01:51,433
Because today,
Steve Prefontaine, 21 years old...

761
01:01:51,513 --> 01:01:53,697
is running up against
the very big boys.

762
01:01:53,782 --> 01:01:55,704
All right, you know the plan:

763
01:01:55,784 --> 01:01:58,207
You're gonna draft behind Bedford
until the last three laps...

764
01:01:58,287 --> 01:02:01,211
then you're gonna go out
and take over the race.

765
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:04,680
Put the crap in all those
damn kickers' legs, Pre.

766
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:07,843
Feel like someone threw a
shot put down your throat?

767
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:11,513
It'll all go away when
the gun sounds.

768
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:14,523
I can't look.

769
01:02:14,602 --> 01:02:17,685
He'll do fine, Elfriede.
He'll do just fine.

770
01:02:17,772 --> 01:02:19,956
Here they are at the line.

771
01:02:20,041 --> 01:02:24,865
There's no field more talented than the
field that is running in the 5,000 meters.

772
01:02:27,381 --> 01:02:30,566
Auf die Platzen.

773
01:02:44,664 --> 01:02:46,848
A very slow pace, Jim.

774
01:02:46,933 --> 01:02:49,515
Sixty-nine-second quarters.
A very slow pace.

775
01:02:49,603 --> 01:02:53,289
This kind of slow pace
favors the finishers...

776
01:02:53,373 --> 01:02:56,092
like Ian Stewart, Lasse Viren...

777
01:02:58,345 --> 01:03:02,463
- Where is Bedford? David
Bedford of Britain. - Who?

778
01:03:02,549 --> 01:03:05,871
Bedford's always been a front-runner,
but he's way back.

779
01:03:05,952 --> 01:03:09,034
Only six laps to go, Erich.

780
01:03:09,121 --> 01:03:11,305
This is a little dangerous...

781
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:13,847
even for Steve Prefontaine,
to let it go this slowly.

782
01:03:13,926 --> 01:03:15,746
This is not good.

783
01:03:15,828 --> 01:03:18,581
If it's so slow, why doesn't Pre
just take over?

784
01:03:18,664 --> 01:03:21,087
'Cause then everyone will
just draft right behind him.

785
01:03:21,167 --> 01:03:23,647
Leading drains you
more than following.

786
01:03:23,736 --> 01:03:26,296
I've never seen Pre
do anything but lead.

787
01:03:36,148 --> 01:03:38,160
Go, Steve!

788
01:03:38,249 --> 01:03:40,433
Sixty-seven on that last quarter.

789
01:03:40,518 --> 01:03:42,907
The kickers are licking their chops.

790
01:03:53,798 --> 01:03:55,880
Now Prefontaine moving up.

791
01:03:55,967 --> 01:03:58,049
And Steve Prefontaine
is going to take the lead.

792
01:03:58,136 --> 01:04:01,060
- One mile to go.
- Four laps to go.

793
01:04:05,243 --> 01:04:07,563
Steve! Steve! Steve!

794
01:04:17,654 --> 01:04:20,578
Viren is moving up on the outside.

795
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,440
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre!

796
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:50,667
Here's Viren going for the lead.

797
01:04:50,753 --> 01:04:54,803
This is when Viren
makes his long drive.

798
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:57,609
This could be the break
from the other group.

799
01:04:57,693 --> 01:05:02,642
You have Viren, Puttemans, Stewart,
Gammoudi and Prefontaine.

800
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:05,188
No man at the age of
21 has ever won...

801
01:05:05,267 --> 01:05:08,020
this long, tough and
thinking man's race...

802
01:05:08,103 --> 01:05:10,287
the 5,000 meters.

803
01:05:20,048 --> 01:05:22,369
Prefontaine going
for the lead again.

804
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:25,237
Just 600 yards to go, and he's
trying an all-out kick.

805
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,902
Come on, Pre!

806
01:05:27,989 --> 01:05:30,571
Look at that magnificent
little son of a bitch.

807
01:05:30,659 --> 01:05:33,583
He knows he can't out-kick Viren,
so he's going to sprint 600 yards.

808
01:05:33,662 --> 01:05:38,382
Pre is running a gutsy race.
What a kick he's putting on.

809
01:05:51,578 --> 01:05:53,660
It's gonna be a last lap fight.

810
01:05:53,747 --> 01:05:56,830
It seems impossible that Prefontaine
can out-kick Viren or Gammoudi.

811
01:05:56,917 --> 01:05:59,067
Viren!
Viren!

812
01:06:01,021 --> 01:06:03,500
Viren is going for his second
gold medal of the Games.

813
01:06:03,589 --> 01:06:05,511
Mohammed Gammoudi
is right with him.

814
01:06:05,591 --> 01:06:07,980
And so is Steve Prefontaine!

815
01:06:08,061 --> 01:06:10,211
The kid is showing all
the guts in the world.

816
01:06:10,296 --> 01:06:13,254
Go, World!
Kick their asses!

817
01:06:13,333 --> 01:06:17,019
He's hanging in there
with the kickers.

818
01:06:17,103 --> 01:06:19,458
Prefontaine going for the
lead with Gammoudi.

819
01:06:19,539 --> 01:06:21,359
You can do it!
Come on!

820
01:06:21,441 --> 01:06:24,092
Viren is still there.

821
01:06:24,177 --> 01:06:26,793
We're coming to you live
from the Munich Stadium.

822
01:06:26,879 --> 01:06:30,770
Nobody in the world knows how it's going to
turn out until they head down the stretch.

823
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:34,945
Coming to the last turn!
Here comes Prefontaine!

824
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:37,807
Let's go!
Come on, baby!

825
01:06:56,174 --> 01:06:58,153
And here it comes.

826
01:06:58,243 --> 01:07:02,292
The Brit's try to pass Prefontaine
for the bronze. It's going to be close.

827
01:07:28,739 --> 01:07:33,596
That man is one of the world's
greatest runners in a long time.

828
01:07:33,676 --> 01:07:38,602
At the age of 23, Lasse Viren,
the policeman from Finland, has won it.

829
01:07:38,681 --> 01:07:42,128
How do you feel about
winning two gold medals?

830
01:07:51,728 --> 01:07:53,980
He ran his heart out.

831
01:07:55,732 --> 01:07:57,711
He ran his heart out.

832
01:08:07,276 --> 01:08:09,232
Let him go.

833
01:08:09,311 --> 01:08:13,998
Viren! Viren! Viren!

834
01:08:14,082 --> 01:08:17,734
Viren! Viren!
Viren!

835
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:22,188
Viren! Viren!
Viren! Viren!

836
01:08:22,363 --> 01:08:27,174
Viren! Viren!
Viren! Viren!

837
01:08:27,296 --> 01:08:30,048
This is the way it ended...

838
01:08:30,131 --> 01:08:33,316
almost four years ago on
that night in Mexico City.

839
01:08:40,374 --> 01:08:42,422
Pre?

840
01:08:44,745 --> 01:08:47,600
Oh, no!

841
01:08:55,056 --> 01:08:57,512
- Come on. Let's get you to bed.
- I lost it.

842
01:08:57,591 --> 01:09:01,072
- Come on. You need sleep.
- No. It's my fault.

843
01:09:01,161 --> 01:09:04,141
- Kid, stand up. Help me...
- It's my fault!

844
01:09:04,231 --> 01:09:06,688
- I fucked up!
- It's not your fault.

845
01:09:06,766 --> 01:09:09,985
It was in '66-'67...

846
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:13,085
'67-'68.

847
01:09:13,173 --> 01:09:15,528
I'm sorry.

848
01:09:18,512 --> 01:09:21,197
Bedford never went out.

849
01:09:21,281 --> 01:09:24,261
Son of a bitch has been a
front-runner his whole life.

850
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:26,671
He wimps out now.

851
01:09:26,752 --> 01:09:31,439
I'm such a fuckin' loser.
I fucked up!

852
01:09:31,524 --> 01:09:36,211
You're not a loser.
You ran your heart out.

853
01:09:38,364 --> 01:09:40,753
You got to try and let it go, Pre.

854
01:09:45,604 --> 01:09:46,792
Go, Pre.

855
01:09:48,876 --> 01:09:50,429
Go, Pre.

856
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:54,914
Go, Pre.

857
01:10:41,058 --> 01:10:43,515
Welcome home.

858
01:10:43,594 --> 01:10:45,550
Hi, baby.

859
01:10:45,629 --> 01:10:48,951
There's no fans out there,
are there?

860
01:10:49,032 --> 01:10:50,954
No.

861
01:10:51,034 --> 01:10:52,956
Any reporters?

862
01:10:53,036 --> 01:10:56,357
No one knows you're back.
You okay?

863
01:10:56,439 --> 01:10:58,452
Yeah, I'm all right.

864
01:11:00,943 --> 01:11:02,865
Really, I am.

865
01:11:02,945 --> 01:11:06,369
I'm very proud of you, Steve.
The whole town is.

866
01:11:06,449 --> 01:11:09,873
Yeah, I'm sure. They'll probably
name a street after me.

867
01:11:09,952 --> 01:11:12,204
Call it "Fourth Street. "

868
01:11:24,065 --> 01:11:26,852
Hey!
Pre!

869
01:11:26,935 --> 01:11:29,517
Hey, Mac.

870
01:11:31,072 --> 01:11:33,529
I saw your race.

871
01:11:46,421 --> 01:11:49,845
Somebody forget to tell you
guys the season's over?

872
01:11:49,924 --> 01:11:53,040
Something's happened to Mac.
Must've bumped his head or something.

873
01:11:53,127 --> 01:11:55,277
He's lookin' awfully good.

874
01:11:55,362 --> 01:11:58,809
You, on the other hand,
look like shit.

875
01:11:58,899 --> 01:12:01,015
When'd you get back?

876
01:12:01,101 --> 01:12:03,183
Tell me the rumors
aren't true, Bill.

877
01:12:03,270 --> 01:12:05,352
Which rumors?

878
01:12:05,439 --> 01:12:07,760
This is no time to retire.

879
01:12:07,841 --> 01:12:11,060
You know, someone once said,
"He who runs against time...

880
01:12:11,145 --> 01:12:14,501
has an adversary not
subject to casualties. "

881
01:12:14,581 --> 01:12:18,802
I'm 62. I'm gettin'
too old for all this.

882
01:12:18,886 --> 01:12:21,809
That's bullshit.

883
01:12:21,888 --> 01:12:24,903
You're the best damn
coach in the world.

884
01:12:24,991 --> 01:12:30,440
Who presided over the worst performance
of a U.S. team in Olympic history?

885
01:12:33,066 --> 01:12:35,318
That wasn't your fault.

886
01:12:35,401 --> 01:12:39,497
After all that happened,
you couldn't run those races for us.

887
01:12:39,572 --> 01:12:41,995
We're the ones that blew it.

888
01:12:42,075 --> 01:12:43,997
I blew it.

889
01:12:44,077 --> 01:12:46,295
You could've run for the bronze.

890
01:12:46,379 --> 01:12:49,336
You could've run for the silver.

891
01:12:49,414 --> 01:12:52,338
You ran to win.

892
01:12:52,417 --> 01:12:55,102
I couldn't ask more than
that from an athlete.

893
01:12:57,255 --> 01:12:59,576
It's funny.
These days...

894
01:12:59,658 --> 01:13:03,583
I don't know if I want to train like
hell and kick Lasse Viren's ass...

895
01:13:03,662 --> 01:13:06,222
or stay in bed.

896
01:13:06,298 --> 01:13:10,689
Look, you're not some rube
from Coos Bay anymore.

897
01:13:10,769 --> 01:13:13,954
Nobody's gonna wipe your behind,
warm your milk.

898
01:13:14,039 --> 01:13:16,599
We're past all that now.

899
01:13:16,675 --> 01:13:19,962
If you want to run, you run.

900
01:13:20,044 --> 01:13:23,696
If you don't,
then you walk away from it.

901
01:13:23,781 --> 01:13:27,638
Nobody can coach desire, Pre.

902
01:13:47,570 --> 01:13:49,492
Ellie!

903
01:14:02,418 --> 01:14:05,307
I like your hair that way.
It makes you look older.

904
01:14:05,388 --> 01:14:08,505
I mean, uh, in a good way.

905
01:14:10,593 --> 01:14:13,312
Yeah, you don't look like a boy
from Coos Bay anymore either.

906
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:21,719
When we first came up here...

907
01:14:21,804 --> 01:14:25,422
I thought that was the way
it was gonna be.

908
01:14:25,507 --> 01:14:29,193
You and me, forever.

909
01:14:30,979 --> 01:14:35,495
Things definitely don't always turn
out the way you expect them to.

910
01:14:35,584 --> 01:14:38,200
You know?

911
01:14:39,988 --> 01:14:43,310
I've been reading about
your running in the paper.

912
01:14:43,392 --> 01:14:46,315
You're reading the sports pages?

913
01:14:46,394 --> 01:14:48,316
Yeah.

914
01:14:48,396 --> 01:14:52,947
After we broke up,
I resented it even more.

915
01:14:53,034 --> 01:14:56,390
I thought, if he hadn't
have done all that...

916
01:14:56,470 --> 01:15:00,361
then we would've just stayed in
Coos Bay and lived happily ever after.

917
01:15:03,244 --> 01:15:06,930
But then I watched your
Olympic race on TV...

918
01:15:08,249 --> 01:15:10,934
and I realized...

919
01:15:11,018 --> 01:15:13,805
it's really what you love.

920
01:15:15,188 --> 01:15:18,077
It's really who you are, Steve.

921
01:15:44,783 --> 01:15:48,503
Well, it took a while,
but Pre bounced back.

922
01:15:51,390 --> 01:15:53,642
Hell, he had a great senior year.

923
01:16:03,769 --> 01:16:07,216
Steve Prefontaine,
University of Oregon senior...

924
01:16:07,306 --> 01:16:09,456
wins his fourth straight
N.C.A.A. title...

925
01:16:09,541 --> 01:16:12,101
and breaks his own
American record again.

926
01:16:12,177 --> 01:16:14,736
But something was missing.

927
01:16:14,812 --> 01:16:17,326
You know?
Something was different.

928
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:23,832
That spark he had before
Munich was gone.

929
01:16:23,922 --> 01:16:26,902
Although the words
may be ambiguous...

930
01:16:26,991 --> 01:16:29,607
Let me get another
one down here.

931
01:16:29,694 --> 01:16:32,481
Hey, it's not every day you get
big track stars serving beers.

932
01:16:32,563 --> 01:16:34,485
Hey, Pre, you still running?

933
01:16:34,565 --> 01:16:38,661
Of course he is, you idiot. He has to go
to Montreal and kick some serious butt.

934
01:16:38,736 --> 01:16:41,852
Put things right after what happened
in Munich. Right, Pre?

935
01:16:41,939 --> 01:16:43,952
Am I right, Pre?

936
01:16:44,041 --> 01:16:46,521
The transcripts themselves do
not make things perfectly clear.

937
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:49,226
- Get you something?
- A bottle of Bud.

938
01:16:52,983 --> 01:16:55,497
I'm Mike O'Hara.

939
01:16:55,585 --> 01:16:58,008
There is testimony to support
John Dean's version...

940
01:16:58,088 --> 01:17:00,648
"To the President of the A.T.U.

941
01:17:00,724 --> 01:17:04,911
A representative of the new Professional
Track League has recently approached me. "

942
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:08,476
I'm prepared to offer you more
than I paid Keino, Ryun...

943
01:17:08,565 --> 01:17:12,352
Seagren and Lee Evans combined.

944
01:17:12,435 --> 01:17:14,892
Two hundred thousand dollars.

945
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,726
Two hundred thousand?

946
01:17:19,809 --> 01:17:22,562
"I feel for me to continue now
as an amateur...

947
01:17:22,645 --> 01:17:25,125
"I must get the support
and experience...

948
01:17:25,214 --> 01:17:28,229
"I need to win in Montreal in '76.

949
01:17:28,317 --> 01:17:32,208
"I love my country, but does it
love me enough to allow me...

950
01:17:32,288 --> 01:17:36,679
"to compete in Finland
against my real competition?

951
01:17:36,759 --> 01:17:40,376
"Please let me have a chance
to become the best...

952
01:17:40,462 --> 01:17:43,147
"so I can bring home the gold.

953
01:17:43,231 --> 01:17:47,122
I'm waiting on your answer.
Sincerely, Steve Prefontaine. "

954
01:18:12,059 --> 01:18:13,981
Screw 'em!

955
01:18:14,061 --> 01:18:15,983
What's it say?

956
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:19,510
They're gonna make me run
in Russia instead of Finland.

957
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:22,251
Tell 'em to shove it and
go race Viren anyway.

958
01:18:22,336 --> 01:18:25,920
If I don't run their bullshit TV money
meets in Russia, Cunningham says...

959
01:18:26,006 --> 01:18:28,884
they're gonna suspend me from
any international competition

960
01:18:29,238 --> 01:18:31,707
- for a whole goddamn year.
- What? - Yeah.

961
01:18:32,174 --> 01:18:35,770
People say I should be running
for the gold in Montreal.

962
01:18:35,849 --> 01:18:38,601
For good old
"Red, White and Blue. "

963
01:18:38,684 --> 01:18:40,663
But where has it gotten me?

964
01:18:40,753 --> 01:18:44,678
Living hear on food stamps,
begging for crumbs from the A.T.U.

965
01:18:44,757 --> 01:18:48,944
I never protested.
I always saluted the flag.

966
01:18:49,028 --> 01:18:50,984
But what about at Montreal?

967
01:18:51,064 --> 01:18:53,646
Right now I feel like saying,
to hell with Montreal.

968
01:18:53,733 --> 01:18:56,657
To hell with love of country.
I'm lookin' out for me.

969
01:18:56,736 --> 01:18:59,489
Right now I feel like saying,
to hell with Montreal.

970
01:18:59,572 --> 01:19:02,257
To hell with love of country.
I'm lookin' out for me.

971
01:19:02,341 --> 01:19:05,094
An angry Steve Prefontaine
lashes out...

972
01:19:05,178 --> 01:19:07,759
- Two beers.
- Don't want 'em.

973
01:19:07,846 --> 01:19:10,303
That's a buck.
You ordered 'em.

974
01:19:10,382 --> 01:19:13,237
- Changed my mind.
- It's okay. We can still pay.

975
01:19:13,318 --> 01:19:15,400
Forget that.
I'm leavin', man.

976
01:19:15,487 --> 01:19:17,569
To hell with the country, huh?

977
01:19:17,656 --> 01:19:20,580
Maybe he's just scared that he'll
tank again like he did in Munich.

978
01:19:20,659 --> 01:19:22,581
Well, to hell with him.

979
01:19:22,661 --> 01:19:24,640
- Hey, come on! Take it outside!
- I'll kill ya!

980
01:19:24,729 --> 01:19:26,913
You're a loser!

981
01:19:26,998 --> 01:19:28,920
Get the hell out!

982
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,560
You're goin'down, man!
You're a loser!

983
01:19:40,911 --> 01:19:43,596
What's wrong?

984
01:19:43,681 --> 01:19:46,434
Be honest with me.

985
01:19:46,517 --> 01:19:49,077
Out there at the meets...

986
01:19:49,153 --> 01:19:51,474
tell me the truth...

987
01:19:51,555 --> 01:19:54,240
do I still look like a runner?

988
01:19:54,325 --> 01:19:57,146
Oh, God, Steve.

989
01:19:57,228 --> 01:20:00,186
What is it?

990
01:20:02,867 --> 01:20:06,290
I keep thinking, uh...

991
01:20:06,369 --> 01:20:09,293
what if I don't win
in Montreal?

992
01:20:11,107 --> 01:20:13,792
It's like...

993
01:20:13,877 --> 01:20:16,334
deep down...

994
01:20:16,412 --> 01:20:19,336
I want to turn pro
not for the money...

995
01:20:19,415 --> 01:20:22,634
but so I'll never have
to face Viren again.

996
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:25,643
Didn't you say once that when
a guy gives you his best shot...

997
01:20:25,722 --> 01:20:28,236
and you beat him anyway,
that you own him?

998
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:30,542
I didn't give him my
best shot in Munich.

999
01:20:30,627 --> 01:20:32,549
Exactly.

1000
01:20:32,629 --> 01:20:36,883
He doesn't own me.
I got boxed in at the last turn.

1001
01:20:36,965 --> 01:20:40,014
I know that.

1002
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:47,664
I can't beat Viren...

1003
01:20:47,743 --> 01:20:50,598
if I can't race him, Nancy.

1004
01:21:14,569 --> 01:21:17,129
Hey, Pre! Pre!
How's your training going?

1005
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:19,856
Why don't you guys go buy
somebody else for a change?

1006
01:21:19,941 --> 01:21:23,866
Are you anxious to get back to Europe this
summer and get another crack at Viren?

1007
01:21:23,945 --> 01:21:28,063
The only way I'm gonna get near Viren
is if he takes his summer vacation here.

1008
01:21:28,149 --> 01:21:32,073
Personally, I'd like to give Viren a
5,000-meter tour of Hayward Field.

1009
01:21:35,055 --> 01:21:37,068
Listen up, Pre fans.

1010
01:21:37,157 --> 01:21:39,580
Members of the
Finnish National Team...

1011
01:21:39,659 --> 01:21:41,638
have formally accepted
an invitation...

1012
01:21:41,728 --> 01:21:44,481
from Steve Prefontaine
to come and compete...

1013
01:21:44,564 --> 01:21:47,818
against the Oregon Track Club
at Hayward Field this summer.

1014
01:21:47,901 --> 01:21:50,153
Athletes can't go off
half-cocked...

1015
01:21:50,237 --> 01:21:52,660
inviting foreign teams
into the U.S. for meets.

1016
01:21:52,739 --> 01:21:54,661
Only the A.T.U. does that.

1017
01:21:54,741 --> 01:21:56,925
What?
Go off half-cocked?

1018
01:21:59,746 --> 01:22:02,999
We control the issuance of all
travel permits for the purpose...

1019
01:22:03,082 --> 01:22:07,530
Travel permits of U.S. athletes,
not foreign. I've read the guidelines.

1020
01:22:07,620 --> 01:22:10,544
Well, if you, uh,
read the guidelines...

1021
01:22:10,623 --> 01:22:13,774
then you know that if you promote
an unsanctioned meet...

1022
01:22:13,859 --> 01:22:16,874
you can kiss your amateur
status good-bye.

1023
01:22:19,698 --> 01:22:22,121
So, what's it gonna be?

1024
01:22:23,369 --> 01:22:25,792
Race Viren in Oregon...

1025
01:22:25,871 --> 01:22:29,295
or race him in Montreal?

1026
01:22:29,375 --> 01:22:32,559
Is this America or what? How can
they threaten athletes like this?

1027
01:22:32,644 --> 01:22:36,228
I just don't want to lose my
amateur status. I've worked hard.

1028
01:22:36,314 --> 01:22:38,669
So you want to take on
the whole A.T.U.?

1029
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:42,971
Yeah. We call their bluff,
plain and simple.

1030
01:22:43,054 --> 01:22:45,909
Look, Mac...

1031
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:48,447
do you want that Finn
discus guy or not?

1032
01:22:48,526 --> 01:22:50,983
- I want Kahma.
- And I want Viren.

1033
01:22:51,062 --> 01:22:54,987
This will be our only chance to
face those guys before Montreal.

1034
01:22:55,066 --> 01:22:57,648
If we do this,
there won't be any Montreal.

1035
01:22:57,735 --> 01:22:59,850
It's pretty risky, Pre.

1036
01:22:59,936 --> 01:23:02,518
Hey, Pre, a little help here?

1037
01:23:03,974 --> 01:23:06,556
I'm going ahead.

1038
01:23:08,245 --> 01:23:10,998
You're either with
me or you're not.

1039
01:23:14,117 --> 01:23:16,733
Two more beers, please.

1040
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:19,072
Great.
Thanks.

1041
01:23:31,467 --> 01:23:33,389
Jesus, Bill.

1042
01:23:33,469 --> 01:23:35,391
Doc said it was a seizure.

1043
01:23:35,471 --> 01:23:39,396
Guess I've sniffed too much
shoe glue over the years.

1044
01:23:39,475 --> 01:23:42,228
I passed out right
here on the floor.

1045
01:23:42,311 --> 01:23:44,529
Nerve damage, he says.

1046
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:48,266
You gotta stop with the shoes.

1047
01:23:48,351 --> 01:23:52,242
I'm well-ventilated now.
Don't worry about me.

1048
01:23:54,590 --> 01:23:58,377
According to the newspapers,
you got plenty of worries of your own.

1049
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:03,484
A.T.U.'s making everybody
really nervous, Bill.

1050
01:24:05,433 --> 01:24:07,481
I could use your help.

1051
01:24:07,569 --> 01:24:09,992
I'm retired.

1052
01:24:10,071 --> 01:24:13,154
Wait a second.
What did you used to say?

1053
01:24:13,241 --> 01:24:16,722
"It's hard to slay a dragon
in his own backyard"?

1054
01:24:16,811 --> 01:24:20,929
The A.T.U. will think twice
about defying you here.

1055
01:24:23,351 --> 01:24:26,308
You're the one that's bigger
than the A.T.U. now.

1056
01:24:26,387 --> 01:24:32,075
See if they have the balls to try to stop
Steve Prefontaine from going to Montreal.

1057
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:34,582
My quarter says they don't.

1058
01:24:38,332 --> 01:24:41,722
We don't even have a sports
plan in this country.

1059
01:24:41,802 --> 01:24:44,225
No sports medicine.

1060
01:24:44,304 --> 01:24:46,886
No training facilities.

1061
01:24:46,974 --> 01:24:49,659
After college, our best
amateur athletes...

1062
01:24:49,743 --> 01:24:53,258
are put out to pasture and forgotten
about until the Olympics.

1063
01:24:53,347 --> 01:24:57,601
And then you guys and America...

1064
01:24:57,683 --> 01:25:01,471
wants to know,
where are the gold medals?

1065
01:25:01,554 --> 01:25:07,140
Now, I'm not a greedy athlete
looking for a handout.

1066
01:25:07,226 --> 01:25:11,913
I just turned down a lot of money
to chase the gold in Montreal...

1067
01:25:11,998 --> 01:25:16,389
and, uh, and all I want...

1068
01:25:16,469 --> 01:25:19,120
all we want...

1069
01:25:19,205 --> 01:25:24,130
is a fighting chance
to fulfill our dreams.

1070
01:25:24,209 --> 01:25:27,997
This meet is just one
small attempt by us...

1071
01:25:28,079 --> 01:25:32,698
the athletes, to take control
of our own destinies.

1072
01:25:32,784 --> 01:25:34,763
Pre!

1073
01:25:34,853 --> 01:25:39,301
No.

1074
01:25:40,859 --> 01:25:44,010
Okay, how are we picking up
the Finns from the airport?

1075
01:25:44,095 --> 01:25:46,313
In my MG.

1076
01:25:46,398 --> 01:25:48,821
A dozen athletes?

1077
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:51,289
Ohh, I'll make a few trips.

1078
01:25:51,369 --> 01:25:54,383
And I suppose the pole vault
poles will go in the trunk?

1079
01:25:54,472 --> 01:25:56,622
- Hey.
- Hey, Mac.

1080
01:25:56,707 --> 01:25:59,961
This just came in
down at the track.

1081
01:26:02,246 --> 01:26:04,669
From the A.T.U.

1082
01:26:07,218 --> 01:26:09,641
What now? Are they
sentencing me to prison?

1083
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:12,575
A firing squad would be
more my recommendation.

1084
01:26:20,865 --> 01:26:22,786
They caved.

1085
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:26,113
The meet's sanctioned.

1086
01:26:26,202 --> 01:26:28,386
Ha-ha!
Yes!

1087
01:26:28,471 --> 01:26:30,723
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- All right!

1088
01:26:30,807 --> 01:26:34,732
Nancy!
Yeah!

1089
01:26:34,811 --> 01:26:36,733
Yeah?

1090
01:26:36,813 --> 01:26:39,532
Hey, Yacco, how're you doin'?

1091
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:42,596
Mm-hmm.
Good news.

1092
01:26:42,685 --> 01:26:45,370
Hey, Mac,you're gonna
get your shot.

1093
01:26:45,455 --> 01:26:48,242
Pentti Kahma's definitely coming.

1094
01:26:48,324 --> 01:26:50,645
Yeah!

1095
01:26:50,727 --> 01:26:53,650
- All right, Mac.
- What's that?

1096
01:26:59,635 --> 01:27:01,785
All right, thanks.

1097
01:27:01,870 --> 01:27:04,794
Yeah, I'll talk to you soon.

1098
01:27:11,213 --> 01:27:14,137
Viren's not coming.

1099
01:27:14,216 --> 01:27:18,732
Yacco says he, uh,
strained a muscle.

1100
01:27:24,692 --> 01:27:27,616
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

1101
01:27:37,672 --> 01:27:41,927
Damn it! I should've known he'd
never run against me here!

1102
01:27:42,009 --> 01:27:45,228
Screw the whole thing!

1103
01:27:45,313 --> 01:27:48,202
- Steve. - Screw the whole
goddamn meet.

1104
01:27:48,282 --> 01:27:51,535
People have bought plane tickets.
There are guys who are counting on this.

1105
01:27:51,618 --> 01:27:53,734
Yeah?
Well, they'll live.

1106
01:28:05,031 --> 01:28:08,455
Curtis Cunningham will have a
field day with this in the press.

1107
01:28:08,535 --> 01:28:11,390
The son of a bitch
will rub my nose in it.

1108
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:17,257
I never asked to lead the fight
against the A.T.U. anyway.

1109
01:28:20,479 --> 01:28:22,458
Well, somebody better tell them.

1110
01:28:36,495 --> 01:28:38,713
Oh, man.

1111
01:28:45,004 --> 01:28:47,858
Ah, hell, the meet's still on.

1112
01:29:07,759 --> 01:29:09,977
All I wanted was Viren.

1113
01:29:11,329 --> 01:29:14,480
Well, Viren's not so
sure he wants you.

1114
01:29:14,565 --> 01:29:17,146
Which should tell you...

1115
01:29:17,234 --> 01:29:19,520
he doesn't own you.

1116
01:29:41,725 --> 01:29:44,285
You ready to run?

1117
01:29:44,361 --> 01:29:46,282
Bill.

1118
01:29:46,362 --> 01:29:49,877
Can't run without proper shoes.

1119
01:29:49,965 --> 01:29:52,081
That a one-piece toe?

1120
01:29:52,168 --> 01:29:55,558
Yep. And they are
a thing of beauty.

1121
01:29:55,638 --> 01:29:58,687
Piss it all.
Give me a second.

1122
01:29:58,774 --> 01:30:00,958
What are you doing?

1123
01:30:01,043 --> 01:30:04,331
- My new business partner.
- You got a business partner?

1124
01:30:04,413 --> 01:30:07,564
Yeah, a former walk-on of mine
with average speed.

1125
01:30:07,650 --> 01:30:09,902
Says when we put these
in production...

1126
01:30:09,985 --> 01:30:12,965
we're gonna need a splashy logo
if we expect 'em to sell.

1127
01:30:13,055 --> 01:30:15,705
What's that supposed to be?

1128
01:30:15,790 --> 01:30:18,611
We're calling 'em
the Nike Swoosh.

1129
01:30:18,693 --> 01:30:20,945
The what swoosh?

1130
01:30:21,029 --> 01:30:23,145
His idea.

1131
01:30:23,231 --> 01:30:25,847
Greek goddess of victory, 490 B.C.

1132
01:30:25,934 --> 01:30:28,858
Well, it looks like needless
wind resistance to me.

1133
01:30:28,937 --> 01:30:32,156
With us in the booth
for the first time ever...

1134
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:35,858
former Duck coach and legend-in-residence,
Bill Bowerman.

1135
01:30:35,944 --> 01:30:39,198
- Welcome, Bill.
- It's nice to be here, Wendy.

1136
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:42,829
Down on the field,
Finland's Pentti Kahma...

1137
01:30:42,916 --> 01:30:45,840
the top-ranked discus
thrower in the world.

1138
01:30:50,023 --> 01:30:52,275
There's one heck of a toss, Bill.

1139
01:30:54,361 --> 01:30:58,479
With a final throw of 211 feet,
four inches.

1140
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:02,988
Uh... last up in the discus...

1141
01:31:03,070 --> 01:31:06,494
now, um, Oregon's own Mac Wilkins.

1142
01:31:06,573 --> 01:31:08,495
Hey, there's Pre!

1143
01:31:08,575 --> 01:31:10,657
- There he is!
- Hey, Pre!

1144
01:31:10,744 --> 01:31:13,098
- Pre!
- Pre!

1145
01:31:15,548 --> 01:31:20,133
This will be Mac's final throw.
Currently in second place.

1146
01:31:37,570 --> 01:31:41,084
Wilkins delivers his
best toss ever...

1147
01:31:41,173 --> 01:31:43,858
212 feet, three inches.

1148
01:31:43,942 --> 01:31:45,955
He wins the competition.

1149
01:31:46,044 --> 01:31:49,525
And he establishes a new
Hayward Field record.

1150
01:31:49,614 --> 01:31:53,061
For today, Mac Wilkins is the
best discus man in the world.

1151
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:10,813
Hold this for me until
the end of the race.

1152
01:32:10,901 --> 01:32:12,755
Good luck, Steve.

1153
01:32:12,837 --> 01:32:14,759
Go get 'em, son.

1154
01:32:14,839 --> 01:32:16,921
Hi.

1155
01:32:21,512 --> 01:32:24,072
Do I look like a runner?

1156
01:32:28,953 --> 01:32:31,035
This will be the final event...

1157
01:32:31,121 --> 01:32:34,010
of today's first annual
Finn/Oregon Meet.

1158
01:32:34,091 --> 01:32:36,013
5,000 meters.

1159
01:32:36,093 --> 01:32:38,414
Ah, what the hell.

1160
01:32:40,797 --> 01:32:43,220
Thanks for coming and
bailing me out, Shorter.

1161
01:32:43,299 --> 01:32:45,221
I love sticking it to the A.T.U.

1162
01:32:45,301 --> 01:32:47,451
Are you going to the
party tonight?

1163
01:32:47,537 --> 01:32:50,188
- Runners to your mark.
- I guess so.

1164
01:32:50,273 --> 01:32:52,833
I'll see you there.

1165
01:32:59,048 --> 01:33:02,302
With two laps to go,
Pre makes his move.

1166
01:33:10,759 --> 01:33:14,013
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre!

1167
01:33:14,096 --> 01:33:16,815
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!

1168
01:33:16,899 --> 01:33:18,617
Go, Steve!

1169
01:33:18,700 --> 01:33:21,157
Come on!
Come on!

1170
01:33:21,236 --> 01:33:24,091
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre!

1171
01:33:26,241 --> 01:33:30,792
I hope you people at home realize
what a rare runner this man is.

1172
01:33:37,585 --> 01:33:41,976
The kind a coach sees
only once in a lifetime.

1173
01:33:42,056 --> 01:33:45,605
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre!

1174
01:33:47,561 --> 01:33:50,041
Come on, Steve!
Go, son!

1175
01:33:50,415 --> 01:33:53,352
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!

1176
01:33:53,470 --> 01:33:56,803
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!

1177
01:34:24,431 --> 01:34:28,447
Hey, Mac, you really
kicked Kahma's ass today.

1178
01:34:28,535 --> 01:34:31,151
I couldn't have done it
without this meet.

1179
01:34:31,237 --> 01:34:34,422
- # Once you get started #
- You know something?

1180
01:34:34,507 --> 01:34:37,430
It's like all those years,
to me...

1181
01:34:37,509 --> 01:34:39,795
you were just a talented
little jerk.

1182
01:34:39,878 --> 01:34:42,164
I'm serious.
You were a jerk.

1183
01:34:42,247 --> 01:34:44,602
I never understood you.

1184
01:34:44,683 --> 01:34:47,106
It took me a while too.

1185
01:34:47,186 --> 01:34:49,268
Well, now I do.

1186
01:34:49,355 --> 01:34:52,142
I live and breathe the discus, Pre.

1187
01:34:52,224 --> 01:34:54,510
I mean, I hate Christmas...

1188
01:34:54,593 --> 01:34:56,879
and Thanksgiving and Easter...

1189
01:34:56,962 --> 01:34:59,112
and anything that
disrupts my routine.

1190
01:34:59,198 --> 01:35:03,453
It worked for you today, man.
You beat the best.

1191
01:35:03,535 --> 01:35:06,514
Didn't always work for me.

1192
01:35:06,604 --> 01:35:09,289
Yeah, well, you aren't done yet.

1193
01:35:09,374 --> 01:35:11,695
No, I'm not.

1194
01:35:14,779 --> 01:35:18,465
# Once you get started #

1195
01:35:18,549 --> 01:35:20,369
# Oh, it's hard to stop #

1196
01:35:20,451 --> 01:35:23,875
Everybody shut up, will you?

1197
01:35:25,957 --> 01:35:28,915
I think we should all raise our
glasses to our Finnish guests...

1198
01:35:28,993 --> 01:35:31,644
for coming and making the
meet such a great success.

1199
01:35:31,729 --> 01:35:34,879
Hear!
Hear!

1200
01:35:34,965 --> 01:35:37,752
And, uh, to my roommate Pre.

1201
01:35:40,971 --> 01:35:42,984
Some guys win races.

1202
01:35:43,073 --> 01:35:46,657
Other guys watch and
learn and pass it on.

1203
01:35:46,743 --> 01:35:49,894
I never thought I'd learn so much
from a guy from Coos Bay.

1204
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:52,767
But I did.

1205
01:35:52,849 --> 01:35:57,104
And, uh, I've enjoyed
every damn minute.

1206
01:35:57,187 --> 01:36:00,167
So... to Steve.

1207
01:36:00,257 --> 01:36:02,816
To Steve.

1208
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:06,944
Well, this was a team effort...

1209
01:36:07,029 --> 01:36:11,420
and thanks to everybody here
who helped put this together.

1210
01:36:13,469 --> 01:36:17,565
There's a feeling I got today
unlike any other.

1211
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:20,393
I guess, uh...

1212
01:36:22,144 --> 01:36:25,898
I guess it's what I thought
Munich would be.

1213
01:36:29,652 --> 01:36:32,006
I'm so glad we did this.

1214
01:36:35,523 --> 01:36:38,208
Way to go, World.

1215
01:36:38,293 --> 01:36:40,909
- Yeah.
- Way to go, Steve.

1216
01:36:43,965 --> 01:36:48,891
# They say every man
needs protection #

1217
01:36:51,306 --> 01:36:56,733
# They say that
every man must fall #

1218
01:36:59,948 --> 01:37:04,532
# Yet I swear I see
my reflection #

1219
01:37:07,187 --> 01:37:12,045
# Somewhere so high
above this wall #

1220
01:37:14,495 --> 01:37:17,350
# I see my life... #

1221
01:37:36,182 --> 01:37:39,003
Jesus Christ!
Come on! Hold on!

1222
01:37:39,085 --> 01:37:42,202
- Can't breathe.
- Hold on, kid. I'll get you.

1223
01:37:42,288 --> 01:37:45,041
Somebody help me!

1224
01:37:50,463 --> 01:37:53,284
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna get help.

1225
01:39:02,065 --> 01:39:06,081
He's dead, and that's final.

1226
01:39:06,169 --> 01:39:11,027
No amount of misery or suffering
by me is gonna bring him back.

1227
01:39:11,107 --> 01:39:13,826
I remember realizing that...

1228
01:39:13,910 --> 01:39:18,358
I had kind of settled for things
since we had broken up.

1229
01:39:18,448 --> 01:39:21,269
And he never did that.

1230
01:39:26,688 --> 01:39:30,112
I looked at him at that party
that night, and I thought...

1231
01:39:30,192 --> 01:39:34,117
he's gonna make a great
husband, father.

1232
01:39:36,965 --> 01:39:39,889
The best time in my life
was my time with him.

1233
01:39:46,375 --> 01:39:48,889
Well, let's be honest.
I mean, the only reason...

1234
01:39:48,977 --> 01:39:53,835
that we're sitting here talking about Pre
right now is because Pre was a winner.

1235
01:39:53,915 --> 01:39:56,565
People need winners.

1236
01:39:56,651 --> 01:39:59,575
Pre went to Munich to win.

1237
01:39:59,654 --> 01:40:02,976
In Montreal, by God,
he would have.

1238
01:40:10,831 --> 01:40:12,913
I woke up the morning
after the meet.

1239
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,252
I was out of my bed like a bull.

1240
01:40:15,336 --> 01:40:18,260
I ran down to the corner
to buy me a paper.

1241
01:40:18,339 --> 01:40:21,263
I took enough money
to buy ten copies.

1242
01:40:21,342 --> 01:40:24,265
I had beaten Pentti Kahma.

1243
01:40:26,279 --> 01:40:28,759
I mean, this was gonna be
my sports page today.

1244
01:40:28,848 --> 01:40:31,305
It was my big moment.

1245
01:40:35,522 --> 01:40:38,446
Then I just saw it
all over the papers.

1246
01:40:42,529 --> 01:40:44,850
You know what my
first thought was?

1247
01:40:44,931 --> 01:40:48,116
"That son of a bitch found
a way to beat me again. "

1248
01:40:51,037 --> 01:40:54,483
Pre ran every race as
though it were his last.

1249
01:40:56,542 --> 01:40:58,760
This is his last.

1250
01:41:04,416 --> 01:41:07,840
This is the bell lap for
Steve Prefontaine.

1251
01:41:15,294 --> 01:41:17,910
Go, Pre!
Go, Pre!

1252
01:41:17,996 --> 01:41:19,952
Go, Pre!

1253
01:41:20,032 --> 01:41:23,149
Go, Pre!
Go, Pre!

1254
01:41:23,634 --> 01:41:26,743
Go, Pre!
Go, Pre!

1255
01:41:27,372 --> 01:41:30,570
Go, Pre!
Go, Pre!

1256
01:41:31,042 --> 01:41:34,198
Go, Pre!
Go, Pre!

1257
01:41:34,545 --> 01:41:38,082
Go, Pre!
Go, Pre!

1258
01:41:38,416 --> 01:41:43,570
Go, Pre! Go, Pre!
Go, Pre!

1259
01:42:37,006 --> 01:42:40,590
# May God bless and
keep you always #

1260
01:42:40,676 --> 01:42:43,531
# May your wishes all come true #

1261
01:42:43,612 --> 01:42:46,592
# May you always do for others #

1262
01:42:46,682 --> 01:42:49,764
# And let others do for you #

1263
01:42:54,088 --> 01:42:57,706
# May you build a
ladder to the stars #

1264
01:42:57,792 --> 01:43:00,249
# And climb on every rung #

1265
01:43:00,328 --> 01:43:02,649
# And may you stay #

1266
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:08,887
# Forever young #

1267
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:17,463
# Forever young #

1268
01:43:18,712 --> 01:43:23,399
# Forever young #

1269
01:43:25,252 --> 01:43:29,109
# May you stay #

1270
01:43:30,958 --> 01:43:33,279
# Forever young #

1271
01:43:37,631 --> 01:43:40,987
# May you grow up
to be righteous #

1272
01:43:41,068 --> 01:43:44,026
# May you grow up
to be true #

1273
01:43:44,104 --> 01:43:47,118
# May you always
know the truth #

1274
01:43:47,206 --> 01:43:50,255
# And see the light
surrounding you #

1275
01:43:54,647 --> 01:43:58,071
# May you always
be courageous #

1276
01:43:58,150 --> 01:44:00,835
# Stand upright
and be strong #

1277
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:03,070
# And may you stay #

1278
01:44:06,692 --> 01:44:09,206
# Forever young #

1279
01:44:13,232 --> 01:44:17,986
# Forever young #

1280
01:44:19,204 --> 01:44:24,130
# Forever young #

1281
01:44:25,877 --> 01:44:29,973
# May you stay #

1282
01:44:31,616 --> 01:44:33,937
# Forever young #

1283
01:44:38,256 --> 01:44:41,510
# May your hands
always be busy #

1284
01:44:41,593 --> 01:44:44,641
# May your feet
always be swift #

1285
01:44:44,728 --> 01:44:47,652
# May you have a
strong foundation #

1286
01:44:47,731 --> 01:44:51,019
# When the winds
of changes shift #

1287
01:44:55,172 --> 01:44:58,619
# May your heart
always be joyful #

1288
01:44:58,709 --> 01:45:01,462
# May your song
always be sung #

1289
01:45:01,545 --> 01:45:03,695
# And may you stay #

1290
01:45:07,284 --> 01:45:09,605
