00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:44,500
<i>We were on the front lines containing
the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster.</i>

You like the singing?

21
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,999
Nathalia Lavina.

22
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
She is the Russian Britney Spears.

23
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,152
How much further?

24
00:03:18,153 --> 00:03:22,499
Don't be so nervous, we will
be there in a couple of minutes.

25
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,499
- You are sure that they are here?
- Yes, they are here my friend.

26
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,000
This is the best place
to keep them safe.

27
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,000
This is it.

28
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,999
<i>Don't worry, the Geiger-Counter
is a precaution.</i>

29
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,999
The level of radiation is the
same as a ray-x of teeth.

30
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Bullshit you hear about this place...

31
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:12,000
Just to get more money
from you Americans.

32
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,499
- What was that?
- Don't worry.

33
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,999
- Suppose someone finds us here?
- Everything is fine my friend.

34
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,200
I have made arrangements for
the security for this place.

35
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,999
We are in the base of the main reactor.

36
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,500
You can make a "tour" if you like.

37
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,499
Would you like to see the place
where they make the big boo-boo?

38
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,500
No! Let's cut the 50 cent tour and
tell me where the hell they are.

39
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Behind you.

40
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,000
<i>The last of the Trioxin-5 canisters.</i>

41
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,999
- Is this all of them?
- No, there are 3 more barrels upstairs.

42
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,500
Nicholai, go and get them.

43
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,600
<u>PROPERTY OF THE US ARMY</u>

44
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,800
When the American military
ordered the canisters destroyed,

45
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,499
the authorities here
'followed the instructions'.

46
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,200
It wasn't until later, that these
surfaced in the underground.

47
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,500
And was put here for safe keeping.

48
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,499
It's ironic that it is the American
government that wants them.

49
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,999
Let's get something absolutely clear,

50
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,499
the American government has nothing
to do with this transaction.

51
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,700
Of course Mr. Garrison.

52
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,200
Now, how many do you want
for your personal use?

53
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,999
All of them.

54
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,999
Nicholai! What are you doing?

55
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,200
Excuse me.

56
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Nicholai...

57
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,500
Brains...

58
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,200
<i>and we make your favorite
snack foods too. Hybra Tech...</i>

59
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,499
Hey Pyro. Get moving.
You are going to be late for school.

60
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,999
- I am using one of my sick days.
- Stop with this!

61
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,999
You'll burn the whole house down.

62
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I can start with your room if you like.

63
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,300
You are having a good
old time, aren't you?

64
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,300
If Mom and Dad were still alive.
But they're not, are they?

65
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,500
Why don't you just blow up the whole
neighborhood while you are at it?

66
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,500
Morning, uncle Charlie.

67
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,600
Don't forget to mauld
the lawn after school.

68
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:04,500
Sure.

69
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,199
How was the convention in Bakersfield?

70
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,200
Uneventful.

71
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,750
I heard that Hybra Tech
is sponsoring one of the

72
00:10:16,751 --> 00:10:18,999
monster trucks for the
big rally next week.

73
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,500
Really? I didn't know that.

74
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I was wondering if you can score
some tickets for me and Zeke?

75
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Or not.

76
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,500
- Becky!
- Hi Julian!

77
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,000
Look out!

78
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Beck, are you alright? Grap
my bag, I'll get your bike.

79
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,000
- How many bikes is it this month?
- I don't know, four?

80
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
- Hi Becky. How are you doing?
- Oh, I am doing fine. How are you?

81
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,999
Hi Guys!

82
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,499
- Hi Katie.
- Hi Baby.

83
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,999
What's wrong? No kiss for
the former-boyfriend?

84
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,500
- You smell like farm wather.
- I got it, calm down.

85
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,199
I take it as he's not handling
the break-up to well?

86
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,999
No.

87
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,999
Hi Guys! Are you going to check
out my gymnastics today?

88
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,499
Oh yeah, bet you look real
good bent over the bar.

89
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,999
Up your!

90
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,500
Name the time, You got 4 more years
to get a piece of this solid man.

91
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,500
- What did he mean?
- I got accepted to Florida University.

92
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,500
You mean to tell me,
that you got in without

93
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:35,999
hacking into the computer system...

94
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,499
and making it all happen
like you usually do?

95
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,000
All by myself, just like a big boy.

96
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,999
I see you guys later.

97
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,999
- Where are you going? What's wrong man?
- Time to celebrate!

98
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,500
Touchy subject.

99
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,500
"What are we all doing tonight?"

100
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Katie.

101
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,499
Katie, you work at Hybra Tech don't you?

102
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,499
I bet you see all sorts of examples
of these scientific processes.

103
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:30,199
Actually, I work in the
monitoring station in security.

104
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,499
Hybra Tech is a classic
example of a company...

105
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,499
whose goods and services
constantly udelices...

106
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,499
the scientific discovery processes.

107
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,499
They create almost everything,
from processed cheese to napalm.

108
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,999
A very unfortunate part in the
scientific processes is failure.

109
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
In simple terms, you can not make a
omelette without breaking a few eggs

110
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,499
Where are you going?
Get back to your seat please.

111
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,499
What is going on here?

112
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,499
Julian parents was 2 of the volunteers
that died last year at Hybra Tech...

113
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,700
they where in a car-wreck.

114
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,000
Julian! Wait.

115
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,999
She didn't know.
It's cool...

116
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,799
They been on my mind a lot lately.
It's been really hard on my brother too.

117
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,500
I am so sorry.

118
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,499
Thanks... I'll be alright.

119
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,499
Well, well, well... What have we here?

120
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,800
- Hi Zeke.
- Hello young lovers.

121
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:46,500
- I got to get back to class.
- See you back in class...

122
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,799
<u>Strictly hands of Bro.
Zeke, I wouldn't do that.</u>

123
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,999
She's just my friend. You wouldn't?
That's what best-buds do, don't they?

124
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,999
Yeah!

125
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I can think about a dozen times...

126
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,199
I have been the best
friend you ever have.

127
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,999
Saved your ass, lie for
you, stolen for you.

128
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,499
Zeke, I am telling you.
Nothing is going on.

129
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,000
- So we are on the same page?
- Yeah.

130
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,500
Ok, come on, let's hang out. I steal
6 packs of beer how does that sound?

131
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,750
<i>Tonight, me and you we
are going to the movies.</i>

132
00:15:33,751 --> 00:15:35,999
<i>Leo is in a new movie.
You got to see it.</i>

133
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,199
- I can't, I have to work tonight.
- Why do you work in that awful place?

134
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,999
I need the money, I have
to save up to college.

135
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,999
Alright, whatever. I ask
Mimi to go with me.

136
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Ok, see you later. Bye!

137
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,500
All hands on deck.

138
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:15,500
Jake? Uncle Charlie? Anybody home?

139
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,999
<i>This is Charles Garrisons secretary
calling from Hybra Tech...</i>

140
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
<i>Mr. Garrison will be
working late again</i>

141
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:28,999
<i>tonight and will see
you sometime tomorrow.</i>

142
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,500
<i>Stay out of trouble and Julian
still needs to mould the lawn.</i>

143
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Where the hell are you guys?

144
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,499
- You scared the shit out of me.
- You should look into that.

145
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,500
I brought you something to eat.

146
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,499
Way to go Zeke!

147
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,999
Now get out of the way and let me
show you how it's really done.

148
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,500
I want to see Acho
finally get it right.

149
00:20:06,501 --> 00:20:09,000
No, that's cool.

150
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:14,499
Don't be chicken-shit. Look at Pyro,
he did it and he's a little kid.

151
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,499
You know what they say...

152
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,499
If you fall of a horse you
gotto get right back on.

153
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,999
What they say, if you eat dirt
after falling of 6 meters...

154
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,499
Like he did last week?

155
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,499
You can do it.

156
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,500
We are all about trust, right Bro?

157
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,900
That a boy, show these Barneys
how to catch some air.

158
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
<u>Shit!</u>

159
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,999
What are you doing?

160
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,499
Center the tire and the ramp
does the work for you...

161
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,999
I told you to be one with the bike.

162
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,499
I know how to do it. Damm, where
are you head theses days boy?

163
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,500
What you got on your mind?

164
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,000
Lead, follow or get out of the way.

165
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,500
You alright?

166
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,000
He's out.

167
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Good boy.

168
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Suppertime.

169
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:30,000
<i>I been working on the rail road
all my live long life...</i>

170
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:37,499
<i>I been working on the rail road
to pass the road by...</i>

171
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,499
<i>Can you hear the whistle blowing...</i>

172
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,999
Crusty, where the hell you been?

173
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,200
- Joe, I am doomed.
- We're all doomed.

174
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Just in time for dinner ah?

175
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
When was the last time you took bath?

176
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,500
Probably the last time...
I brushed my teeth.

177
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,300
They don't call me Crusty for nothing.

178
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,000
His vitals are good,
he's just unconscious.

179
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,499
Probably a concussion.

180
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,500
- Where are you taking him?
- Community.

181
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,500
It's Katie.

182
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,499
Hi Julian, are you alone?

183
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,999
No but I was just about to call you.

184
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,999
- Zeke is on his way to the hospital.
- What happened? Is he OK?

185
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,499
He fell of his bike. He's unconscious.

186
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,000
Oh my God...

187
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,999
Hector.

188
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,500
Hector, can you please get that?

189
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
- Julian, can I call you later?
- Ok, bye.

190
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,500
Joey! It's not bedtime now.

191
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,000
Dinner is almost ready.

192
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,000
Joey, wake up. I can't cook.

193
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,999
I am here to see a patient.
Bordan, Zeke Borden.

194
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
- What is you name?
- Julian Garrison.

195
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,499
I am sorry Mr. Garrison,
I don't see his name.

196
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,250
- Maybe he already checked out?
- No, he just got here.

197
00:27:20,251 --> 00:27:23,000
Can you check again please.

198
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,499
This is Helena of the reception.

199
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:34,000
Was a Mr. Borden admitted to you today?

200
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:38,500
He was? He has a visitor.

201
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Thank you very much. Someone
will be right with you.

202
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,500
Joey! Joey has waked up.

203
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,500
Sleepyhead! It just leaves more for me.

204
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,999
Mr. Garrison?
Dr. Banks.

205
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,500
- Are you a relative of Mr. Borden?
- I am his friend.

206
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,999
Do you know how we can
contact his parents?

207
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
- Yes, can I see him?
- No, he is not here Mr. Garrison.

208
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,499
What do you mean?

209
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,000
Mr. Borden had an
unexplained reaction of

210
00:28:48,001 --> 00:28:50,499
the painkillers that was given to him.

211
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,500
He was pronounced dead on arrival.

212
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,700
Zeke?

213
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,000
- Hello?
- Hi, Julian it's Katie.

214
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:59,199
Katie... I just found
out that Zeke's dead.

215
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,199
What are you talking about? I just
saw him, that's why I'm calling you.

216
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,000
<i>He's at Hybra Tech, he's not dead...</i>

217
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,250
He was taken out of an ambulance.
They where

218
00:30:09,251 --> 00:30:11,999
wheeling him towards
the research center.

219
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,999
I have no idea why he would be here.

220
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,500
I'll keep tracking, I'll call you back.

221
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,850
My uncle said that there
is no reason why Zeke

222
00:30:22,851 --> 00:30:25,199
should be there but he's
acting really strange.

223
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,499
I know, I saw him.
It's a conspiracy.

224
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,999
Well, we are about to find out.

225
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,500
Consumption, Defense, Administration...
Look for anything medical...

226
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,999
Human resources, Operations, Research.
There is nothing here.

227
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,500
Try Research.

228
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,999
Try Medical Research.

229
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,999
Great, no access.

230
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,500
No problem just give me a second.

231
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,500
<i>Hybra Tech owns the hospitals
and ambulances. They</i>

232
00:31:01,501 --> 00:31:04,000
<i>could steal patients and
no one would ever know.</i>

233
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,300
Bingo!

234
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
What is NECROPOLIS?

235
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,977
Surgery, Neural system, Nursery...
New subjects!

236
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,999
Borden, Zeke.
Head trauma.

237
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,500
I knew that something was
going on over there.

238
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,999
What do you think they
gonna do with them?

239
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,500
Someone over there are using
humans as guinea-pigs.

240
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:50,499
- What do we do now?
- Go in there and get them.

241
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,499
- You're not serious?
- Carlos, we have to.

242
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,999
- Zeke will turn into a guinea pig.
- Why not try calling him?

243
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,499
My uncle knew Zeke was there.

244
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,999
He is lying, I say we go
in there and get him.

245
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,500
Maybe I can help?

246
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,000
Helmet.

247
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,500
Is anybody there?

248
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,700
Where the hell am I?

249
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,799
- Are you ready for this?
- NO!

250
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,199
Carlos, don't be a chicken shit.
Snap out of it.

251
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,199
Let's go and get him.

252
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,800
<b>LEAD, FOLLOW or GET OUT OF THE WAY.</b>

253
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,499
So... Why are you working tonight?

254
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,999
I am just trying to
increase my overtime.

255
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
- Saving for Christmas.
- Oh, Christmas is cool.

256
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:36,000
<i>'Pause Cameras'</i>

257
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,200
- Are you Ok over there?
- Yeah, good to go.

258
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,200
Cody, what happened?

259
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,800
What was that?
Cody, get up!

260
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,999
- Carlos, what are you doing?
- I am just saving my ass.

261
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,499
- You don't even know what it is.
- What's that?

262
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,000
Don't come any closer.

263
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,000
I am warning you.

264
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,000
<i>HE HE HE HAAA!</i>

265
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,500
He's not dead.

266
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,000
It is now.

267
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,500
- Why did you bring a gun?
- Lucky for you I did.

268
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
- Hector!
- What? What?

269
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Bring me a chocolate milk.

270
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:22,000
Nice Pooper.

271
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
What the hell?

272
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,499
- <i>Hey! Who are you?
- Hey big boyyy...</i>

273
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:54,000
Ever got your freak on with a
trip of joy on salutary gymnast?

274
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,999
I hope Kate took care of the cameras.

275
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,250
Looks like she already
opened the door.

276
00:40:28,251 --> 00:40:30,500
Let's hope it was her.

277
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,499
- Listen to that shit man.
- Let's go back.

278
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:48,499
We have come this far, let's
just go and get them.

279
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,500
Katie, can you hear me?

280
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,999
I am here, where are you?

281
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,499
At the first door.

282
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,499
Go throw the doors and head
to the right corridor...

283
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:07,000
I don't know how long Mimi can
keep Hector busy so hurry up.

284
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,250
Stay to the right, 18
meters down of the left

285
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:29,500
hand side you will find
the ventilation room.

286
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,799
- We're at the door.
- Good, you are at the ventilation room.

287
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,000
- Unbolt the door.
- It's already opened.

288
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Did you hear Julian, the
doors are already unlocked.

289
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:57,499
Somebody probably forgot to lock the
last time they where down there.

290
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,500
Be on your toes just to be safe.

291
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Katie, witch dock is it?

292
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
<i>We are looking for 'Red'.</i>

293
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,999
<i>We got the 'Red' one.</i>

294
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Look's like someone beat us here...
It smells like burned hotdogs in here.

295
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,750
<i>The grill to the 'Blue'
dock is already removed.</i>

296
00:43:04,751 --> 00:43:07,500
<i>We are putting it back on.</i>

297
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,750
Probably the sensible,
no one has been down

298
00:43:10,751 --> 00:43:13,500
there for years. She
don't know that...

299
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:25,000
We are clear. Let's go.

300
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Start heading South.
You have about 100 meters ahead of you.

301
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,499
What is this place?
A fucking Zoo?

302
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:49,000
- It's probably just exhaust fans.
- Yeah, that's it.

303
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,000
What the fuck was that?

304
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Don't shoot!

305
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
It is fucking Pyro.

306
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,000
Pyro?

307
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,500
You could have killed
somebody you fucking idiot.

308
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Don't touch anything!

309
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,500
Just stay behind me and
you won't get hurt.

310
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,000
Katie, can you hear me?

311
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,500
Katie?

312
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,800
Look's like we're on our own.

313
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:08,500
- Where are you?
- Hello?

314
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:30,000
Where the hell are we?

315
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:34,999
You are at Level 1 of the
HypraTech research facility.

316
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,299
- Busted!
- Uncle Charles...

317
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,499
What the hell are you kids doing here?

318
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:43,499
We are not here to cause any problems.
We're just looking for our friend.

319
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:47,199
You picked a hell of a place to do it!
You are in a lot of trouble!

320
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,499
You said Zeke's not here. But we know
that an Ambulance brought him here.

321
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:55,500
Cody hacked into the computer system and
Katie saw him on the security monitor.

322
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,999
- Ever heard of Necropolis?
- Never heard of it!

323
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,500
I don't know what you are talking about.

324
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,500
How about now? Take us to him so
we can get out the hell of here!

325
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,500
Carlos...

326
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,500
Please, we just want to see him.

327
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:29,499
This is the maximum-security section
where we keep the most violent subjects.

328
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,799
<b>Stay on the walkway and
away from the doors.</b>

329
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,400
Any sudden movement
makes them angry and

330
00:47:35,401 --> 00:47:38,000
trust me you don't
wanna make them angry.

331
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,499
That's Jones.

332
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:49,000
He's got a nasty little
temper doesn't he?

333
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
How about exterminating
all these meatheads?

334
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,865
Where is Zeke?

335
00:47:58,866 --> 00:48:02,800
At the minimum security
with the newcomers.

336
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,500
He's over here!

337
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,000
- Zeke, are you ok?
- Get me out of here!

338
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,050
Just in case you haven't
noticed it dude.

339
00:48:44,051 --> 00:48:45,799
Your uncle sucks!

340
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,799
- Get him out of there!
- I can't...

341
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,000
- How about now?
- I don't have access.

342
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,600
I got your fucking access. Get Back!

343
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,500
Julian, can you hear me yet?

344
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:12,499
You have set the alarm of and the Police
are going to be notified in 10 minutes.

345
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:16,000
Unless...

346
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,500
Where is Cody?

347
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,100
You got to see this...

348
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,000
Don't go in there!

349
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,300
Don't touch anything!

350
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,500
It's a nursery.

351
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,999
How could they have done this? You
people are gonna burn in hell for this!

352
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
That's where you are wrong... I think
what we are doing is quite humane.

353
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,750
We are going to phase
out our human subjects

354
00:50:38,751 --> 00:50:41,499
and replace them with
this cloning program.

355
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,999
It will be HybraTech's finest moment.

356
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,499
- What are all this for?
- Isn't it obvious?

357
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:52,000
- World domination!
- What's everything ultimately for?

358
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,500
Ask what really happened
to your folk Julies.

359
00:50:54,501 --> 00:50:56,500
I bet he knows the truth.

360
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,499
I already explained it,
there was a accident...

361
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:03,500
Accident my ass!
He's lying, just as he lied about Zeke!

362
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:08,400
Do you know what happened uncle Charlie?

363
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,499
I already told you Julies,
your parents where...

364
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,499
<b>BULLSHIT!</b>

365
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,500
Tell him the truth!

366
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:26,500
They are here. Your parents are here.

367
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,499
The company exhumed them
for further testing.

368
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:35,499
<i>They are down in North tower
12:e level, Bioweapon section.</i>

369
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:41,499
And you knew all along? Just say the
words Julies and I wack him right now!

370
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:44,000
I trusted you...

371
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:08,500
Where are you?

372
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,999
Oh no, not again.

373
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,500
They have some serious explaining to do.

374
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:01,999
Hello?

375
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,299
Haj, what's going on sexy?

376
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,550
I don't have time for this right now.

377
00:54:07,551 --> 00:54:09,799
We are in the middle of running
a system check.

378
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,099
You may get some security warnings...

379
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:15,799
I like to run one on you baby.

380
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,999
Know what I am talking about?

381
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,499
Sorry not tonight, I got my hands full.

382
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:25,000
So do I...

383
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:47,000
<i>Why do you keep doing this to me?
You are just sick...</i>

384
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,999
<i><b>Send more security guards...</b></i>

385
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,200
Who is this?

386
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Let's go and find a car and
get the hell out of here.

387
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:45,499
Calm down! Take a breath! We
are gonna get out of here.

388
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,499
First we need to find my parents.

389
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,499
This key-card will get
us into the North tower.

390
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,800
I understand if you guys
want to make a break for it

391
00:55:53,801 --> 00:55:56,700
but I gotto find out
if they are in there.

392
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,999
I got your back Julies.

393
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,000
- Carlos?
- I'm Cool, let's do it!

394
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:40,999
I think I just found our
ticket out of here.

395
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,500
Let's go.

396
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,999
- <i>Mimi!
- Hey girl.</i>

397
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,799
We gotto get out of here,
something terrible is happening.

398
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,029
I'll explain to you later!

399
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:06,299
Don't worry I already
told him everything.

400
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:10,500
- It turns out he doesn't care.
- Let's go! Come on!

401
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,600
The keys are in here.

402
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,300
- It's locked.
- Break it.

403
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:10,299
What's wrong with you?
What are you doing?

404
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:13,999
Back off..
You lay another finger on me and I...

405
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,900
What?

406
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:20,000
Let's just take the remotes.
It will be easier that way.

407
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,499
Son of a bitch...
We gotto get to the 12th floor.

408
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,499
We gonna make it.

409
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:27,000
Look, maybe not.

410
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:54,500
I'm out of ammo.
Let's go to the elevator.

411
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,499
He could still be alive.

412
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:38,199
All the rest of those guys where dead.
There was only one of those things left.

413
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:41,000
He's gone Bro.

414
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,800
It's clear.

415
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:43,800
Wait, did you hear that?

416
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
- Let's go!
- No we can't, it won't start.

417
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:49,000
Zeke help me I can't get a clear shot.

418
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,800
Zeke what are you doing?

419
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,199
Pay attention.

420
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,500
Look for an exit.

421
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:04,499
Damm my head feels like it's on fire.

422
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,999
We are drawing a crowd.

423
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,600
I see that.

424
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:12,199

freaking hole in your head so
you can let the screams out.

426
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:28,499

like to do with you?

430
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,200

They are not your parents anymore.

441
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:37,000
You gotto let them go!

442
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,000
They look like machines,
what are they doing to them?

443
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:45,699
<i>They are making Uber-soldiers in here.</i>

444
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:48,850
