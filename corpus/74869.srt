apologize to the lady.

17

- Yeah, I would, actually.

18

<i>That at certain institutions,</i>
<i>elite groups are formed that'll</i>
<i>network the rest of their lives.</i>

23
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,372
<i>Then that brings us to</i>
<i>the question,</i>

24
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,204
<i>Is America really</i>
<i>a class society?</i>

25
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:01,805
<i>Or is it the meritocracy</i>
<i>we're taught it is since</i>
<i>we were in kindergarten?</i>

I believe that it's
both, sir.

28
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:11,557
How can it be both?
It's been my experience...

29
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:15,720
that merit is
rewarded with wealth,
and with wealth comes class.

I went out with a Skull
freshman year.

he was a Skull?
We got
into this argument...

157
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:16,340
about secret societies
and how they're different
from fraternities...

158
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,570

are for life.

So I just mentioned
the Skulls, and he got
really uncomfortable...

160

and never came back.

it's all a little bit
overwhelming.

to leave a percentage of
his estate to the Skulls."

in the ritual room...

the significance?

our leaders choose
the ordeal of war...

646
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:44,213
Gentlemen.

647
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:46,772
Tonight begins
the revealing process...

648
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:50,342
the final stage
of your admission
into the order.

649
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,820
Come with us
into liars' hell.

650
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:08,001
Gentlemen,
do come in.

651
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:17,805
<i>I'm Dr. Rupert Whitney,</i>
<i>class of'73.</i>
<i>I'm head of protocol.</i>

652
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:20,611
<i>I'll be your guide</i>
<i>for the next few weeks.</i>

653
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:25,178
The revealing process
is our most sacred ritual.

654
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:27,985
It's been a Skull tradition
since the late 1700s...

655
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:31,391
and it is the foundation
of your class's commitment...

656
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:33,395
to each other.

657
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:36,728
Each soul mate pair
will be placed
within the device.

658
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,792
And then you may ask them
any question you want...

659
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,929
about anything that you want.

660
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:46,032
The object is to learn
all that you can
about each other.

661
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:48,976
<i>After they've revealed</i>
<i>all to your satisfaction,</i>

662
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,980
release them.

663
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:54,017
Which pair wants
to go first?

664
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:56,018
Caleb and I will.

665
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,903
<i>Hey, Luke,</i>
<i>what's your worst fear?</i>

666
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,680
My worst fear?

667
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:29,584
My worst fear is that
I'll always be alone.

668
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:32,144
My mother was killed
in a car crash...

669
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:34,918
when I was so young
that I can't even
remember her face.

670
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:39,052
My whole life,
I never had any family,
up until a couple years ago,

671
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:41,359
when I met
a friend who became
like a brother to me.

672
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:44,628
And then last week, he was taken
from me too. Why do you think
this keeps happening, Caleb?

673
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:47,727
Huh? Any ideas?
I don't know, Luke.
Who can answer that?

674
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:51,934
You can. You can tell me
the worst thing
you've ever done.

675
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:58,477
I had an affair
with my mother's best friend.

676
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,743
Why are you so afraid
of your father?

677
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:08,185
My father always
covers for me,

678
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:10,726
always gets me
out of trouble.

679
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:14,156
I never take responsibility
for anything.

680
00:52:14,231 --> 00:52:16,290
Fine. Then take
responsibility for this.

681
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:18,732
What's the worst thing
you've ever done?

682
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,999
- God, where do I start...
- Don't play games
with me, Caleb!

683
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:24,302
What's the worst thing
you've ever done? The worst?

684
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:26,740
- What are you talking about?
- I know what you did.

685
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,744

686
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:31,440

I found this? Hmm?

687
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:36,785
Thank you.

688
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:40,615
I lost this,

689
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:42,749
and I wondered
where it went.

I have a friend,

01:05:55,885 --> 01:05:58,979
but it turns out
that they were all wrong.

Why? Why were
they wrong?

823
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:06,253
Because he was selfish,
and because he was greedy,

824
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:09,924
and he thought they
would give him everything
that he ever wanted.

825
01:06:09,999 --> 01:06:13,958
But all they ended up
giving him was disaster.

01:06:14,036 --> 01:06:19,497
So, now, this friend of mine,
he can go out on a limb,
and that limb could get cut off.

being on that limb is right.

01:32:12,426 --> 01:32:17,625
<i>A toast, to the successful</i>
<i>progression of Skulls.</i>

1124
01:32:17,698 --> 01:32:20,166
- Above any other.
- Above any other.

1125
01:32:20,234 --> 01:32:22,566

[<i>Q</i>uiet Chattering]

1127
01:32:24,739 --> 01:32:27,173
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>No. No. Please,</i>
<i>Mr. McNamara, please.</i>

1128
01:32:27,241 --> 01:32:30,904
You know you're not supposed
to be here, especially
the way you're dressed.

1129
01:32:30,978 --> 01:32:34,414
Oh, Mr. McNamara.
Come to collect your check.

1130
01:32:34,482 --> 01:32:39,419
Under the auspices of Rule 119,
I hereby petition for justice...

1131
01:32:39,487 --> 01:32:44,356
for the satisfaction
of differences between myself
and Mr. Caleb Mandrake...

1132
01:32:44,425 --> 01:32:46,359
in the matter of the death
of Will Beckford.

1133
01:32:46,427 --> 01:32:49,021
- [Murmuring]
- What's Rule 119?

1134
01:32:49,096 --> 01:32:54,261
119: "Of disputes arising
between members
of such serious nature...

1135
01:32:54,335 --> 01:32:57,099
that avail themselves
of no other solution..."

1136
01:32:57,171 --> 01:33:02,438
"A challenge may be presented
and gentlemanly means pursued."

1137
01:33:02,510 --> 01:33:05,707
- And what does that mean?
- He's challenging you
to a duel, Caleb.

1138
01:33:05,780 --> 01:33:10,717
<i>[Men Chuckling]</i>
A duel?
He must be kidding.

1139
01:33:10,785 --> 01:33:14,414
No, sir. I'm not.
Dr. Whitney?

1140
01:33:14,488 --> 01:33:18,515
<i>It is...</i>
<i>part of our tradition.</i>

1141
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:23,257
The man's a fugitive.
He should be arrested.
Call the authorities.

1142
01:33:23,331 --> 01:33:26,630
Our rules supersede theirs.
You of all people know that.

1143
01:33:29,870 --> 01:33:33,704
Then I demand the right
to take the place of my son
in this duel.

1144
01:33:33,774 --> 01:33:36,334
You can't, Chairman.

1145
01:33:36,410 --> 01:33:40,039
"To avoid conflicts of interest,
all council members
are excluded...

1146
01:33:40,114 --> 01:33:43,515
from precedings pertaining
to their kin's fate."

1147
01:33:43,584 --> 01:33:47,987
It's Rule 119-B,
line 15.

1148
01:35:02,196 --> 01:35:05,324
There are two ways
out of this, Lucas.

1149
01:35:05,399 --> 01:35:08,562
One is you can withdraw
your challenge.

1150
01:35:08,636 --> 01:35:10,934
And the other?

1151
01:35:11,005 --> 01:35:15,465
Your dead.
Caleb's a crack shot.
You've got no chance.

1152
01:35:16,844 --> 01:35:20,371
I guess I won't be coming over
for Thanksgiving, then.

1153
01:35:35,396 --> 01:35:39,127
Dad, I have to ask you
this one thing.

1154
01:35:41,368 --> 01:35:44,360
Was Will Beckford
still alive when
I left the ritual room?

1155
01:35:44,438 --> 01:35:46,838
Son, I love you,

1156
01:35:46,907 --> 01:35:49,899
and I've never lied to you.

1157
01:35:49,977 --> 01:35:51,911
The answer is no.

1158
01:36:09,363 --> 01:36:13,129
Gentlemen,
it's time to begin.

1159
01:36:27,148 --> 01:36:29,082
Mr. Mandrake,
you have been challenged,

1160
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:32,085
therefore the choice
of weapons is yours.

1161
01:36:47,701 --> 01:36:49,999
<i>Gentlemen,</i>
<i>take your positions.</i>

1162
01:37:00,281 --> 01:37:02,215
<i>Back to back.</i>

1163
01:37:10,291 --> 01:37:12,418
Tell them the truth
about what happened to Will.

1164
01:37:13,894 --> 01:37:15,828
I'm sorry, Luke.

1165
01:37:15,896 --> 01:37:18,296
Don't apologize to me.
Just tell them the truth.

1166
01:37:19,567 --> 01:37:21,762
No, I'm sorry for what
I have to do to you.

1167
01:37:21,836 --> 01:37:24,771
<i>[Whitney]</i>
<i>Cock your pistols.</i>
<i>Prepare to fire.</i>

was an accident.

You told me that there
are always wars to be fought.

This was your war.
Yes.

1204

Nobody won.

Not true.

He'll never be confirmed
to the federal court.

I'll become Skull chairman.
You'll be exonerated...

01:40:27,054 --> 01:40:30,751
and help me lead
the new generation
of Skulls into the future.

1209

Someone I loved once told me
that if it's secret and elite,
it can't be good.

how to make the world

Do you truly believe you
can walk away from this?
All we've given you?

And someday, when I
call on you for a favor,

1215
01:40:54,148 --> 01:40:56,082
will you be able
to deny me?

1216
01:40:56,150 --> 01:41:00,849

jeopardize the life you've built
for your wife and your family?

I don't know if you can
live with those doubts, Lucas.
