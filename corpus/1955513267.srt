Look, I was forced to, I had no choice.

356
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:48,150
I didn't even pull the trigger.
I just drove the truck.

Look, if they get up here,
they can still call the cops.

There's a cell tower 10 blocks east.

them on total lock-down.

on a different power supply.

00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:32,712
Okay. We can take the stairs
and make it to the park.

- Work what out?

know you're still alive.

they actually see you?
