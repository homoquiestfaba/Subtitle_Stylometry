1
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:51,606
<i>Oh, do we have a party
going on here or what?</i>

2
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:54,585
<i>People,
this is how we do this,
this is how we do it!</i>

3
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:59,723
<i>Now it's time for the moment
we've all been waiting for.</i>

4
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:04,287
<i>For homecoming king,
the winner by a landslide,</i>

5
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:08,364
<i>our star quarterback
and All-American candidate,
Brad Warner.</i>

6
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,664
<i>Crown, please.</i>

7
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:21,239
<i>Looking good, looking good.</i>

8
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,406
<i>And now, by a unanimous vote,</i>

9
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:28,880
<i>homecoming queen,
valedictorian,
senior class president</i>

10
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:33,221
<i>and captain of
the Pirate cheerleaders,
Britney Allen!</i>

11
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,927
<i>She's so hot!</i>

12
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,426
<i>Congratulations.</i>

13
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,430
<i>Britney, do you have anything
you'd like to say?</i>

14
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,772
<i>Yes, I would. Go Pirates!</i>

15
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,509
Five, six, seven, eight...

16
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,346
<i>Go, go, go
Go ye mighty Pirates!</i>

17
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:00,909
<i>Fight, fight, fight
Fight ye mighty Pirates!</i>

18
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:04,650
<i>Win, win, win
Win ye mighty Pirates!</i>

19
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:06,419
<i>Go! Fight! Win!</i>

20
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,154
I'd like to see her naked.

21
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,559
<i>Roll call</i>

22
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,460
<i>I'm Winnie</i>

23
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,265
<i>Brianna</i>

24
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,828
<i>Sierra</i>

25
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,765
<i>Amber</i>

26
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,929
<i>And everyone knows
that I'm Britney!</i>

27
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:22,941
<i>Britney thinks that
she's so hot 'cause she got
the captain's spot</i>

28
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:26,570
<i>Hey, I won that
fair and square I lost
ten pounds and dyed my hair</i>

29
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:30,548
<i>We really made a big mistake
Don't you think
her boobs look fake?</i>

30
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,209
<i>I swear
that this is my real chest</i>

31
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:33,946
<i>My right is bigger
than my left</i>

32
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,009
That's true.

33
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,180
<i>We don't know
just why we chose her</i>

34
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,190
<i>Look at her,
she's such a poser</i>

35
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:42,161
<i>I'll prove to you
that I'm legit
I'll work hard and never quit</i>

36
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:45,391
<i>Not, not, not
Not gonna happen!</i>

37
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:48,662
<i>You, you, you suck
at being captain!</i>

38
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:52,136
<i>Brit, Brit, Brit,
your cheering is for shit</i>

39
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:55,299
<i>Not you, Brit
They're not your real tits</i>

40
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,433
You suck, Britney!

41
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:39,913
Go, Pirates!

42
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,347
Yeah!

43
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:48,789
Gross.

44
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,196
<i>Britney Allen just farted.</i>

45
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,537
<i>Britney.</i>

46
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,436
<i>Britney.</i>

47
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,165
Britney Allen.

48
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,939
I did not fart!

49
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,307
Thank you for sharing.

50
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:26,798
Gloss check.

51
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,624
Soy cheese!

52
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,034
Oh, my God.
I have circles under my eyes.

53
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,303
I look so old.
I could pass for 23.

54
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,572
You got plenty of sleep
in class.

55
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,910
Well, that's because
I was up all night
working on new cheers.

56
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:45,473
You've managed to maintain
a C average
and work on new cheers?

57
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,280
You're such
an over-achiever.

58
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,583
Yeah, Britney,
we already win everything.

59
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:52,819
Amber, it's not enough to win.
I want to go down
in cheer history.

60
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:56,123
You already did.
You made captain, and nobody
can take that from you.

61
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:58,663
Not even me.
Majority rules, remember?

62
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,460
Oh, not the vote thing again.

63
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:02,228
You don't honestly
expect me to apologize

64
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,894
for winning captain
over you, do you?

65
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,096
Of course not.

66
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:07,731
Besides,
it's not the first time
that Winnie's lost to you.

67
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,071
Or the second, or third,
or fourth...
Oh, we get it.

68
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,441
Then get over it, Winnie.
I'm so over it.

69
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,173
Can we not do this now?

70
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,874
You're right.
It's old news.

71
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,142
And as your BFF...

72
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:20,947
Oh, if we're speaking in IM,
you're more like a BFH.
Bitch from hell.

73
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,215
MYOB.
BMA.

74
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,688
WTF, guys?

75
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,267
Thanks.

76
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,333
Half caf, no whip, no foam.
Thanks guys.
Thank you.

77
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,968
Hey, baby.
Hey.

78
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,774
Can I have some?
Sure.

79
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:50,645
No, no, no.
I didn't mean the coffee.

80
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,242
Stop it,
you're embarrassing me.
What? What?

81
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,287
Then I shouldn't do this,
should I?

82
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,188
Brad is so hot.

83
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:01,693
Again,
he's Britney's boyfriend.
Get over it, Winnie.

84
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,752
I'm so not over it, Amber.

85
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,291
Brad, stop it.
People are staring.

86
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,806
What? Sweetie, sweetie,
you sound like...
You sound like such a virgin.

87
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,397
I am a virgin.

88
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:20,537
I'm a quarterback, babe,
people expect me to score.

89
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,373
Well, I want my first time
to be special.
I am special.

90
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:27,078
Well, I mean,
we have to be special.

91
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,882
I don't want to be
like those other girls.

92
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:31,822
What, those other...
Like what?
Audrey, Shannon, Lisa...

93
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,519
Yes. Those other girls.

94
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:37,028
Look, babe, you're nothing
like those girls.

95
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:38,461
Well, prove it.

96
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:41,331
If you can show me
your commitment

97
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,164
by the homecoming dance,
then maybe.

98
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:47,002
Yes! No, no. What? Two months?

99
00:06:47,306 --> 00:06:49,774
That two months is too long.
That's two months too long.

100
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,037
No, come on,
don't make me
wait that long, Brit.

101
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,045
Brad,
you've been waiting for me
since ninth grade.

102
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:55,842
Two months won't kill you.

103
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,277
All right, fine.

104
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,343
But at homecoming, it's on.

105
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,052
Oh, it is so on.

106
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,273
Go, Pirates!

107
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,840
Cradle.

108
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,950
Good job, guys.
Let's do that one more time.

109
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,457
Oh, come on, Brit.
I could do that routine
in my sleep.

110
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:43,154
Sometimes I walk
in my sleep. I wonder
if I can cheer in my sleep.

111
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,589
Wow! It worked.

112
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,630
Let's take a break.

113
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:51,594
Got you, buddy.

114
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:58,374
If ever there was
an argument for bulimia,
it's Brianna's ass.

115
00:07:58,444 --> 00:07:59,809
Give her a break.

116
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,279
You're the only one
who wants a butt
like an Olsen twin.

117
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:06,978
Amber alert. Pacific Vista
has never had
a fat cheerleader.

118
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,620
Well, Brianna's
the best on the squad.

119
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:10,349
So she gained a little weight
over the summer.

120
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:11,685
She doesn't look that bad.

121
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:15,193
Are you kidding me?
The girl's a cow.
You have to talk to her.

122
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:18,424
Britney, you don't have to
say anything. It's your squad.

123
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,930
Brit, if you don't say
something to her, I will.

124
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:26,063
Okay, fine,
but after practice.

125
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:28,800
Why wait? Hey, Brianna.

126
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,337
Britney has something
she wants to tell you.

127
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,436
No, Winnie,
not in front of everyone.

128
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,345
Yeah, Winnie,
that's so rude.

129
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:37,780
Hi.
Hi.

130
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,675
Hey, what's up?

131
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,618
Your weight, Brianna.

132
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:49,191
No it's not. I weigh
just a couple pounds
more than last year.

133
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,923
And that was pushing it.

134
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,694
I didn't realize.

135
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,569
Well, look,
just lay off the snacks and

136
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:03,769
with the extra workouts,
the weight
should come right off.

137
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,873
What if it doesn't?

138
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:13,916
Put it this way.
Pacific Vista's
never had a fat cheerleader.

139
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,659
Wow, Brit.

140
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,630
Why didn't you
just rip out her belly ring?

141
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,826
That would've been
less painful.

142
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:33,202
Don't worry. That's exactly
how I would have handled it.

143
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:38,974
Yeah, totally.

144
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,947
<i>There it was,
another number one hit
from Rihanna.</i>

145
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:48,009
<i>Now, attention
all high school cheerleaders,</i>

146
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,851
<i>Rihanna is hosting an audition
for her TV special.</i>

147
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:54,017
<i>So, if you think
you have what it takes,
pay attention.</i>

148
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:58,325
<i>You can download
the contest rules right now
on Cingular Source. Com.</i>

149
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:03,266
<i>Now, with more hits,
brace yourself,
here they come, KXKB SoCal...</i>

150
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:12,638
Hi, Mommy.
Hey.

151
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,237
Guess what?
We're going to be
on television.

152
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,009
What?
Yes.

153
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,451
Oh, hi, Daddy.
Oh, hey, princess.

154
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,453
What're you doing home?

155
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,492
How was school?
School was school.

156
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,027
And how was practice?

157
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,962
Great as usual.
The squad
loves my new routine.

158
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,022
And plus,
we're auditioning
for a TV show.

159
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,933
Oh, Britney, honey,
that sounds fantastic.

160
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,227
Did you hear that, Tim?
Yes, Pam.

161
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,102
TV.
I heard.

162
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:44,098
This is going to be
a little more difficult
than I thought.

163
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:45,404
What's wrong?

164
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,378
Britney,
your father lost his job.

165
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,312
And we're gonna have to
take a pay cut.

166
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:53,716
The company's relocating
to Crenshaw Heights.

167
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:58,084
Oh, Daddy, you'll have
such a long commute.

168
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:02,984
No, I won't, Britney.
We are moving
to Crenshaw Heights.

169
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,932
I'm really
going to miss you guys.

170
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:12,028
I said, we are all moving

171
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:15,665
to Crenshaw Heights.

172
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,006
Are you insane?
I just made captain!

173
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:22,172
Honey, it's still
early in the year. You'll just
transfer to another school.

174
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,648
Honey, you're smart,
you're pretty, you're blonde.

175
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,912
You'll make plenty of friends.
It'll be fine.

176
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:29,887
Yeah, fine for you guys.
You're old. Your life is over.

177
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:32,014
I am a senior,
my boyfriend's a quarterback

178
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,956
and I'm a cheerleader,
damn it!

179
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:40,696
If you leave,
who's gonna help me remember
my locker combination?

180
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,700
Oh, Sierra,
it's your birthday.

181
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:44,565
My birthday is April.

182
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:48,733
Sweetie, your combination
is the digits
of your birthday.

183
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,066
Oh!

184
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:52,767
What are digits?

185
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:57,742
We're really
going to miss you, Britney.
IMYA.

186
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:00,945
I miss you already, too.

187
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,488
Oh, guys. I'm gonna MYSM.

188
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:05,813
D-A-M-N.

189
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:09,461
Sierra,
you're not speaking IM.
You're just spelling.

190
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,459
Oh, well then, S-H-I-T.

191
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:16,592
Come here, I love you.

192
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,866
You know, Crenshaw Heights
is only an hour away.
We can still be friends.

193
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:22,999
Yeah, but we can't
enter the audition
without a captain.

194
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:27,174
Actually, we have a captain.
Me.

195
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,539
Get over yourself, Winnie.

196
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,482
No, she's right.

197
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:35,212
Spirit law states
that if the head cheerleader
has to step down,

198
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:39,451
the next cheerleader with
the highest amount of votes
is captain.

199
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:43,085
Thank you. And I promise
I'll use everything
you taught me.

200
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:46,757
Wait, wait. Babe,
you're not going to be
a cheerleader anymore?

201
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:49,899
I can't.
I have put my heart and soul
into this squad.

202
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,199
Cheering with anyone else
would just make me...

203
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,761
A cheer whore.

204
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,872
Exactly.

205
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,606
My cheer days are over.

206
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,204
You have to swear.

207
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,183
Swear to us
that you're never
going to cheer again.

208
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,618
Brit,
you don't have to do this.

209
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,454
I swear.

210
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,095
Let's make it official.

211
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,000
"Ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.

212
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,896
"Now you're not
a cheerleader...
I can't do this.

213
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,770
"...that must really suck."

214
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,241
Brit.

215
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,343
This is a sad, cheerless day.

216
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:41,250
I know.
Those poor dead pom-poms.

217
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,712
Put them back.
No!

218
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:46,417
Leave her alone.
She's screwing up everything.

219
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,323
No!
This is stupid.

220
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,722
Please let me keep my pom-poms
and I swear,

221
00:13:52,798 --> 00:13:56,757
as God is my witness,
I will never do another
toe-touch again!

222
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,829
She lost.
She's definitely lost.

223
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:01,763
Damn.
For real.

224
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,130
OMG.

225
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,747
Yo, Camille.
You gotta check out this CD
I just burned.

226
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:19,716
Some of this shit
ain't even out yet.
That's hot.

227
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:22,151
We gonna
set it off this year.
Okay.

228
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:25,486
Hey, y'all should see
the krump moves
I've been working on for us.

229
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:28,048
Jesse, it's cute
you trying to be

230
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,493
into choreography and stuff,
but I got this.

231
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:33,190
You just stick
to finding us the beats,
all right, boo?

232
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,098
All right, cool. But one day,
you'll come begging
for what I got.

233
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,227
Shoot, I'm begging now.
Hook a sister up.

234
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:39,532
Kirresha.
What?

235
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,004
You are too hot to beg.

236
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:44,509
I know, but he just so fine,
I'm willing
to make an exception.

237
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:47,602
<i>Don't tease me, mami.
Me gustan las chicas grandes.</i>

238
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,511
<i>I don't know what you said,
but me gustan, too, baby.</i>

239
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,811
He said he likes big girls.

240
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,648
Now, why come when you say it,
it don't sound cute at all?

241
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,415
Look, he's the one
who said it, all right?

242
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:57,853
Don't hate
'cause he on me.

243
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:59,982
Tyson!
Damn, Camille.

244
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:03,756
Look, you put it out there,
and I'm just
showing my appreciation.

245
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:05,353
You stupid.
Grow up.

246
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,830
Love you, too.
So immature.

247
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,799
What's up?
Hey.

248
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:11,893
Looks like
we finally about to get
some snow on campus.

249
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:16,406
Look y'all. Mall baby
must've got separated
from her mother.

250
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,965
What's she doing here?

251
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:20,375
<i>I don't know.
This ain't the OC.</i>

252
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,107
Maybe she's lost.

253
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,073
Hey!

254
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,483
Yo, Pop-Tart,
you got any black in you?

255
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:29,612
No.

256
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,546
You want some?

257
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:34,225
Oh, no, you didn't!
Come on, man.

258
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,591
OMG.
Look what you did.

259
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,225
Well, it's not like it's real.

260
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,526
For real?
Say what?

261
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,032
And how would you know?

262
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,728
Because this one is real.

263
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:45,667
Oh, that's nice.
Can I touch that?

264
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,330
My mama bought me this purse.

265
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:48,930
Oh, your mama.
For sure. Yeah, yeah.

266
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,407
Well, your mother must shop
at the swap meets

267
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:51,966
because that knock-off sucks.

268
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,274
Oh, I know you didn't
just talk about my mama.

269
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,144
Kirresha, hold my shit.
Take it.
Oh, wait a second. Hold on...

270
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:58,410
Camille.
What?

271
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,044
Don't do this.
You're gonna get suspended.
So?

272
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,088
You think I'm gonna let this
little Barbie-looking heifer

273
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,316
come up here
and talk about my mama?

274
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,855
Heifer?

275
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:10,292
Did you just call me fat?
And I did not just talk
about your mama.

276
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,592
FYI, you did.

277
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:15,861
You speak IM? NFW!

278
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,765
Oh, no.
This girl didn't called you
the N word.

279
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:18,894
Oh!
Take them.

280
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,598
I would never.

281
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,765
Some of my best friends
live next door
to black people.

282
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:27,206
Oh, hell, no.
Camille, come on.
We gonna be late to class.

283
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,214
Yeah, she right, girl.
We better go. I ain't trying
to get detention.

284
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:34,776
Count your blessings,
white girl,
'cause you just got lucky.

285
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,285
Cut you.

286
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:42,984
I feel scared, maybe
a little nauseous, but
I definitely don't feel lucky.

287
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,071
Oh, hold on, now.

288
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,211
What is this, LAX?

289
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,221
I have my ears pierced.

290
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,061
Hello, Sherlock.
Another piercing.

291
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,067
They're my keys, you perv.

292
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:29,202
Would you give the girl
her bags?
Thank you.

293
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,468
Hey, what's wrong with you?

294
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,545
Come on, man.

295
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:51,728
Is this English?
Are you Mrs. Webster?

296
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,027
It is, I am, and you're late.

297
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,198
Well, I was going through
airport security.

298
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:02,536
Class, meet Britney Allen.
She's a transfer
from Pacific Vista High.

299
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:03,597
Hi, Britney.
Hi.

300
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:06,667
<i>She's one of those PV bitches.
Mendiga gringa.</i>

301
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:09,908
Well, Miss Allen,
have a seat
and copy the board.

302
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,210
You want me to copy
all of that?

303
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:16,279
Can't you just give it to me
in, like, a book?

304
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,321
Unfortunately, we don't have
enough books for everybody,

305
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,794
and I'd hate to single you out
by giving you one of your own.

306
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,296
We wouldn't want
the other students to think

307
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:29,493
that you are more important
than they are, now would we?

308
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:35,664
No.

309
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,841
Good guess.

310
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,444
I know!

311
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,843
You can e-mail it to me.

312
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:48,948
You think
if we don't have books,
we would have computers?

313
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,286
I'm glad
you have a sense of humor.
Now find a seat.

314
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,551
<i>Good morning,
Crenshaw Heights...</i>

315
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:54,683
Excuse me.

316
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,557
<i>... just a few announcements
today.
Excuse me.</i>

317
00:19:56,628 --> 00:20:00,086
<i>Coach Carter extends
the Warriors' invitation
to our...</i>

318
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:02,429
Excuse me.
Excuse me?

319
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:06,431
What the hell?
Get your ass out of my face.

320
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,640
<i>Mrs. Webster,
Parole Officer Don
needs a deposition</i>

321
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,642
<i>from you regarding
yesterday's lockdown.</i>

322
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,541
<i>Please come
to the administration office
as soon as possible.</i>

323
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,807
Class, I'll be right back.

324
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:19,144
<i>Thank you, and learn today.</i>

325
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,221
"Can't you just, like,
give it to me in a book

326
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,089
and then my servants
can learn it for me?

327
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:32,597
"And then I could spend,
like, all day
brushing my hair."

328
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:52,542
Do you have
any organic greens?

329
00:20:58,690 --> 00:20:59,884
Yummy.

330
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:13,295
Hey, yo.
Check this out.

331
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,337
We got
some new shit for y'all.

332
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,170
Here we go now!

333
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,812
<i>Roll call!</i>

334
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:30,748
<i>Roll call!</i>

335
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:32,380
<i>My name is Leti
Yeah</i>

336
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,788
<i>I like to party
Yeah</i>

337
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,690
<i>And when I shake it
Yeah</i>

338
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,025
<i>The boys say, "Ai, mami"</i>

339
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:41,523
<i>Roll call!</i>

340
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,363
<i>My name, Camille
Yeah</i>

341
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:45,027
<i>Give you three wishes
Yeah</i>

342
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:46,798
<i>To see me shake it
Yeah</i>

343
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:48,635
<i>'Cause I'm delicious</i>

344
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:51,768
<i>Roll call!</i>

345
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:53,606
<i>My name, Kirresha
Yeah</i>

346
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,169
<i>Get out my face
Yeah</i>

347
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:56,874
<i>And when I shake it
Yeah</i>

348
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:59,178
<i>It's like an earthquake</i>

349
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:05,981
Don't forget, everybody,
pep rally after school, right?

350
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,920
Enjoy the show, white girl?

351
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,326
I didn't know
you were a cheerleader.

352
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:17,061
I'm the cheerleader.
I'm captain.

353
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,635
So? I was captain
at my old school.

354
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,570
And now you go to my school.

355
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,835
So, I guess that makes you...

356
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:26,104
nothing.

357
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:59,034
<i>Hey, Britney. Hey, Britney.</i>

358
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:01,079
We can't wait to see you
at the homecoming dance.

359
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:03,410
Send us a message.
Hey, how's your new school?

360
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,677
Don't join a gang.
At least, not the first day.

361
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:07,343
<i>Bye!
Bye!</i>

362
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:26,902
Hey, guys.
Britney sent a video.

363
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:37,640
Tears of joy.
She's so happy.

364
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:53,058
Oh, shit. My bad, shorty.

365
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:55,429
Don't touch me.

366
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,337
So, you just gonna lay there?

367
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,540
I don't see how my day
could get any worse.

368
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,569
Tough first day?

369
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:08,470
I've been there.

370
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,741
Are you new, too?

371
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:14,183
No, I transferred
my sophomore year.
But, man, was that hard.

372
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:16,186
When did it get easier?

373
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,045
Last Thursday.

374
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:19,623
Great.

375
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:21,181
I was joking.

376
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:27,062
What's your name?

377
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,267
Britney.
Jesse.

378
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,602
I guess I should get up now.

379
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:38,199
Unless you want footprints
on your forehead.

380
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:45,748
Thanks.
You're welcome.

381
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:52,553
Weren't you headed...

382
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,988
That way. Yeah.

383
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,512
Yeah!

384
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:02,987
<i>Cheerleading tryouts tomorrow
after school in the north gym.</i>

385
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:07,220
<i>Now, your Warriors JV team!</i>

386
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:17,402
Damn, you must really be
into me to be following me
around all day.

387
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,874
I didn't know
you were a cheerleader.

388
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:22,709
It's not usually
the first thing I tell a girl.
Why not?

389
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:25,409
'Cause the cute ones
don't really go
for queerleaders.

390
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:27,417
I'm a cheerleader, too.

391
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:30,119
Well, I was.
I know.

392
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:35,258
How?
'Cause your biceps
are as hard as a rock.

393
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,427
You got a little bit
of a turn-out, but
too many muscles for a dancer,

394
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:41,226
so it's gymnast
or cheerleader.

395
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,725
You've been watching me.

396
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:48,398
You got a nice ass, too.
You coming to tryouts?

397
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:52,538
No. I can never cheer again.

398
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:55,979
Why not?
Because I swore that I...

399
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:01,013
It's complicated.
Don't even waste your time,
Jesse.

400
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:02,178
She can't hang.

401
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:04,721
Camille,
you don't even know her.
Oh, I know her.

402
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:08,350
Miss fancy-fingernails-
shimmy-shimmy lip-gloss-
Barbie.

403
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:11,021
She don't got what it takes
to be a Warrior.

404
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:14,065
Look, my old squad
would have made yours
look like newbies.

405
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,692
Prove it.
Yeah, show us what you got.

406
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:18,326
Or what she don't got.

407
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:20,904
And if I make the squad?
Not likely.

408
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,530
Not interested.

409
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:28,273
Keep fronting, white girl.
You ain't fooling nobody.

410
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:46,356
So,

411
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:50,696
all of y'all think
y'all good enough
to be cheerleaders.

412
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,492
That's funny.

413
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,695
Well, unless you can
do this...

414
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,273
Come on, Leti!

415
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:59,843
Don't waste our time.

416
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,873
And if you can't do this...

417
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,412
Get them, Kirresha.

418
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:10,914
Then why
are you still here?

419
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,388
And don't you think
you're gonna be able to get by

420
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,654
without being able to do this.

421
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,059
Come on, boys.

422
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:19,494
Let's go, Jesse.

423
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:26,601
Bye-bye.

424
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:28,272
Or this...

425
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:39,710
That's right. That's right.

426
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:44,219
Oh,
now you see what it takes
to really be a Warrior.

427
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:49,021
This is more like it.
Now, pay attention, 'cause
I'm only gonna say this once.

428
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,728
Now you can start.

429
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,603
All right,
this is how it's going down.

430
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:08,475
I'm gonna do a routine
and I'll do it
a couple of times.

431
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:11,174
But if you can't keep up,
you're cut.

432
00:29:11,616 --> 00:29:15,985
Now, if anybody survives,
then we'll decide if you're
good enough to be a Warrior.

433
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,812
Y'all got that?

434
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,989
All right, follow me.

435
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:22,424
Five, six, seven, eight.

436
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:27,124
One and two
and three and four,
five, six, seven, eight.

437
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:31,794
One and two
and three and four,
five, six... Watch those feet.

438
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:36,534
One and two
and three and four,
five, six, seven, eight.

439
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:41,272
One and two and three
and four, five, six,
seven... Let's try it.

440
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:45,976
One and two
and three and four,
five, six, seven... Let's go.

441
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:49,577
One and two and three
and four, five, six...

442
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:50,814
You can't keep up, white girl?

443
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:55,519
One, two, three, four,
five, six... Last time.

444
00:29:55,593 --> 00:30:00,030
One and two
and three and four,
five, six, seven, eight.

445
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:04,692
One and two
and three and four,
five, six, seven, eight.

446
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:09,363
One and two
and three and four,
five, six, seven, eight.

447
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,874
One and two
and three and four,
One, two, three, four,

448
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:14,036
five, six, seven, eight.
Five, six, seven, eight.

449
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,808
One, two, three, four.

450
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,808
That's the best you got?

451
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:34,031
Damn,
vanilla latte got skills.

452
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:37,192
Yeah, you've gotta put her
on our squad.
She was not that good.

453
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:38,997
Girl, don't even trip,
you know she was on point.

454
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,038
Why are you
fronting like that? You know
she's was the business.

455
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:42,299
All right, you what?
Y'all need to chill.

456
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:43,806
Hey, Barbie.

457
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:47,443
It's Britney.
Whoever.

458
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,906
You get to call yourself
a cheerleader again.

459
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:55,314
IDTS.

460
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,053
No thanks.

461
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,490
You know,
there are a hundred girls
who would kill for this spot?

462
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:05,085
Good. Then you don't need me.

463
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,358
See you.

464
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,645
Girl, we need her.

465
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,116
We got to fill that spot,
Camille.

466
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:32,748
I said, no. So did she.

467
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:36,191
Reality check,
Camille. She's the only one
with enough cheer experience.

468
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,354
Powderpuff is as good
as any of us.
Word.

469
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:41,296
Y'all, she's rude. Conceited.

470
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,991
And she think she all that.

471
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,058
Name one cheerleader
who doesn't.

472
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:47,400
Do it for the squad.

473
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:58,839
What the hell?
She's already acting
like a Warrior.

474
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:07,384
Look, we both know
you don't have any place
to fit in here

475
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:08,584
except for the squad.

476
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,594
What, are you
cheer pimping now?

477
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:12,857
What's that supposed to mean?

478
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,165
I'm not a cheer whore.

479
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:18,734
You're not a cheerleader,
either.

480
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:21,203
If you were,
you'd have to cheer.

481
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,706
'Cause I hear PV
is a cheer-or-die
type of squad.

482
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,970
Huh, and your squad
couldn't touch us.

483
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:27,102
Us?

484
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:29,977
You don't cheer for them
anymore.

485
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:32,983
The way I see it,
you got two choices here.

486
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:35,452
Either be at our practice,

487
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,819
or bitch from the bleachers
by yourself.

488
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:48,527
<i>Rihanna TV special</i>

489
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,032
<i>brought to you by
Teen People magazine,</i>

490
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:52,501
<i>so you cheerleaders
get those routines...</i>

491
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,983
Hey, how'd it go?

492
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:19,096
Did you join the squad?

493
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,597
They hate me.
Oh, they don't hate you.

494
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:27,126
And I promised my friends
that I would
never cheer again.

495
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:30,572
Well, what kind of friends
would ask you to quit
something that you love?

496
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,006
You don't understand.

497
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:35,443
Britney, honey, we can never
give up cheering,
not completely.

498
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:37,978
I cheer for your daddy
every night.

499
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:42,416
Okay,
you didn't need to hear that.
But I also cheer for you.

500
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:44,987
I even cheer
for myself sometimes.

501
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:48,387
Spirit is what makes life fun
even when it isn't.

502
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,454
And there's only
one question here.

503
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:53,625
Do you love cheerleading?

504
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:55,657
Yes.

505
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:58,395
Yes. Well, then,
do what's right for you.

506
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:01,097
And your real friends
will just be happy
that you're happy.

507
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:03,470
Now come
and help Mommy unpack.

508
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,709
But our routines
are choreographed
for ten girls, not nine.

509
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,977
And we gonna make it eight
if you don't stop whining.

510
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,918
<i>Don't be getting mad at me
because that chica blanca
turned you down.</i>

511
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:19,383
Hey, Frosted Flake
in the house.

512
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:24,484
Hey, Buffy. Ready to be
my baby's mama?

513
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,790
Tyson.

514
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,991
Do it again,
and I'm plucking grapes.

515
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:32,569
Or in your case, raisins.
Got it?

516
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:34,328
Yeah.
Okay.

517
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,561
Okay.

518
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,403
Damn, Tyson, that's what
your nasty ass gets.

519
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:41,335
Hi, I'm Kirresha.

520
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,505
Hi, I'm...
Oh, girl,
I know who you are.

521
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,674
You was killing at the tryouts
the other day.

522
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,684
When I saw you, I was like,

523
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:51,051
"Damn. That girl
know how to cheer
her butt off."

524
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:53,721
What little butt you do have.

525
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:56,351
We need to fatten you up
just a little bit, baby.

526
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,692
Have you ever had
fried Twinkies?
Fried Twinkies?

527
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:02,289
So, what made you
change your mind?

528
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:06,899
Oh, I figured
if I was cheering, this place
might suck a little less.

529
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:11,232
I love your school spirit.
Everybody, this is Britney.

530
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,771
What?

531
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,407
Oh, nothing.
I'm just surprised
you know my name.

532
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:21,508
I was expecting you to
introduce me as White Girl.

533
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:22,951
Oh? Well, my bad.

534
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:26,888
Everybody,
this white girl's name
is Britney.

535
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:29,591
You happy?

536
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:31,156
Ecstatic.

537
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:34,327
Good. Now we can get started.

538
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:46,004
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

539
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:53,247
<i>Say check it out
Say what?</i>

540
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,251
<i>Warriors is our name</i>

541
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,446
<i>And cheering is our game</i>

542
00:35:57,788 --> 00:35:59,983
<i>We've got winning on our mind
And...</i>

543
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:02,615
<i>We're mighty fine</i>

544
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:03,751
Yeah.
See, that was good.

545
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:06,956
I can't hear y'all. Again.

546
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,527
<i>Warriors is our name</i>

547
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:13,092
<i>And cheering is our game</i>

548
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:15,768
<i>We've got winning on our mind
And...</i>

549
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,066
<i>We're mighty fine</i>

550
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:19,336
<i>Say what?</i>

551
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,978
<i>We're mighty fine</i>

552
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:26,043
<i>Crenshaw Heights!</i>

553
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:32,182
Britney Cheers, what was that?

554
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,448
Spirit fingers.

555
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:38,522
Everybody does spirit fingers.

556
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:42,331
I've got a spirit finger
for you.

557
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:48,038
Oh, so you're the only one
who can contribute ideas?

558
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:49,572
That's right.

559
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:53,837
This is not a cheer-ocracy.
And there's room
for one captain only.

560
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,469
You understand that?

561
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,043
Whatever.

562
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:02,315
All right, we need
to work on these stunts
for this audition.

563
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,184
What audition?
The Rihanna TV special.

564
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:07,156
We need them computers.

565
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:13,153
You can visit my website,
Cheerwhore. Com.

566
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,030
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

567
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:21,128
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
Go on, go on.

568
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:23,765
One, two, three, four.

569
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:25,502
Okay. Do it again.

570
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:30,076
Winnie, can I stop now?

571
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:32,782
Are you still thinking
about food?

572
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:34,542
Yes.

573
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:36,447
Then, no.

574
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,080
Keep running
until you're not hungry.

575
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:43,024
Why are we practicing
out here? Britney always
had us work out in the gym.

576
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,618
There was a reason for that.

577
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:48,062
Look, Britney's gone now,
so I'm making some changes.

578
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:52,430
Starting with the audition.
Britney's routine
will make her immoral.

579
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:54,695
It's "immortal," Sierra.

580
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:59,300
It's irrelevant, Amber.
I'm captain now,
so get over it.

581
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:01,504
I am so
not over it, Winnie.

582
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:05,312
Watch and learn.

583
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,031
What the...
What are you doing?

584
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:47,089
Somebody get that girl
a pole.
Yeah, for real.

585
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:51,861
<i>S-L-U-T</i>

586
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:54,022
<i>What does that spell? Winnie!</i>

587
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,022
No, it doesn't.

588
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,763
You know, as captain,
I could kick your ass
off this squad.

589
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,829
And as a black belt,
I could just kick your ass.

590
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:06,872
Yes, that was...
You guys should...

591
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:11,404
Wow. Yeah, Winnie.
Winnie, Winnie, Winnie.

592
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:13,772
Yep.

593
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:19,848
I actually need
a study partner for
the algebra breast on Friday.

594
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:22,522
Can you help me out?

595
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:24,856
Yeah. I'd be happy to.

596
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:27,090
All right.
I'll swing by later then.

597
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:28,863
What's up, Amber?

598
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:31,234
You tell me, Brad.

599
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,065
And this is why
we practice in the gym!

600
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:43,135
Go, go, go!
Go, go, go!

601
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,788
What are you doing?
You're not doing it right.

602
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:10,798
And one, two, three...

603
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:13,469
Girls, what are you doing?
Camille's not here yet?

604
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:16,069
No. She left me in charge.

605
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,308
We're supposed to be
practicing the new routine.

606
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:21,979
What are the boys doing?

607
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:25,920
I don't know. Goofing around.
They never listen to me.
Come on.

608
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,523
Hey, I said we're
supposed to be practicing.
I'll be right back.

609
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:33,757
Nobody listens to me.
Am I speaking English here?

610
00:40:38,135 --> 00:40:40,763
Go, go, go!
Go, go, go!

611
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,170
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

612
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:53,239
Stop it, guys! Violence
never solves anything.

613
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:55,975
Chill, we're krumping.
What?

614
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:58,180
Look and learn, Pixie Stick.

615
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,116
There we go, Tyson!

616
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,386
Go, go, go!
Go, go, go!

617
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,258
Yeah. Give it, Jess.

618
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:11,790
Yeah.

619
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:22,276
How do you guys move so fast?

620
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:24,644
I could probably show you
better than I could tell you.

621
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:27,707
Oh, no, no, no.
I wouldn't know what to do.

622
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:30,913
It's like street theater.
Improv the anger in you.

623
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:33,583
I don't have any anger in me.

624
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:37,626
You're a rich, white girl,
stuck here in
Crenshaw Heights. Please.

625
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:40,186
You should be
the angriest person in here.

626
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:46,266
Stop it.
Get mad. Get mad.

627
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:53,775
Yeah, what?

628
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:03,413
All right. Yeah, come on.

629
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:05,483
Yeah, there's that anger.

630
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:11,249
That's it, that's it,
that's it. Come on. Here.

631
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:13,228
There you go, there you go.

632
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:16,094
Come on, get mad. Get mad.
Now, you're tripping.

633
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,196
You better
get your girl, man.

634
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:21,430
For real. All right, D. Go.

635
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,501
Give it, Jess. Yeah.

636
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:28,238
All right. That's right,
that's right.

637
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,076
Okay, white girl.

638
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:50,766
Oh, no!
Quarrel!

639
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:54,202
Damn.
Guess he brought it to you.

640
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:00,168
That's right.
That's right.

641
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:03,102
That boy is fit.
Oh, yeah?

642
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:05,648
Yeah, he's popping his gasket.

643
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,424
You're all right.

644
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:19,962
Will you guys
quit playing around? We're
supposed to be practicing.

645
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,327
I'm still in charge here,
damn it.

646
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:23,525
Hey, Leti, if we added
some of this krumping,

647
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,432
it could really get us noticed
by Rihanna.

648
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:29,598
No. If we change
Camille's choreography,
she'll be pissed.

649
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:33,939
Yo, Leti. Camille ain't even
here. If you're in charge,
act like it.

650
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:36,844
Don't tell me what to do.
Come on. Try something new.

651
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:39,405
Yeah, girl.
We can always change it back.

652
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:41,747
Yeah, don't be scared.
I'm not scared.

653
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:44,617
Leti, this could help us win.

654
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:00,065
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

655
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:08,671
Come on. Get it.

656
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,587
It's good, yeah.
That was great.

657
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,486
That was so good.
Pretty hot.

658
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:22,050
That was great.

659
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,423
Whose idea was this?

660
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:28,492
Well,
I came up with the steps.

661
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:30,123
But we all contributed.

662
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,963
Yeah. It was a group effort.

663
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:34,129
I had nothing to do with it.

664
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,903
So, do you like it?

665
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:42,774
Hell, no.

666
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:48,748
Camille, don't blame them.
It was my idea
to change the routine.

667
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:49,877
Why?

668
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:52,547
Because half of the moves
in your routine are illegal.

669
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:54,648
What are you? A cheer cop?

670
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,787
You can't do that.

671
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,989
No, girl,
you can't do that.

672
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:07,929
Judges take off points
for vulgarity.
I know the rules.

673
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,798
Then why do you keep
breaking them?

674
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:14,833
Because the things we do
get us noticed.

675
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:17,846
Even when we don't win,
they say we're the best.

676
00:45:17,948 --> 00:45:20,746
Wouldn't you rather they say
you were winners?

677
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:21,876
I mean, come on, Camille,

678
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:24,250
if we play by the books
and add this krumping,
we can't lose.

679
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:27,188
Is this the type of shit
your old squad pulled on you?

680
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:29,657
Changing cheers
behind your back?

681
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:31,719
No.

682
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:35,321
And if there was one girl
who thought
she could run your squad

683
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:38,835
better than you could,
what would you
have done to her?

684
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:40,768
There was.

685
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:44,866
I should've told her to stop.

686
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:48,810
And see, that's the difference
between me and you,
white girl.

687
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:51,710
I'm not telling you.

688
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:58,049
Now let's practice this
the way it's supposed to be.

689
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:01,547
See? Y'all should've
listened to me.

690
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:19,432
Hey, you.
You're late.

691
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:23,308
Sorry.
I had to study, sweetie.

692
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:28,180
That's okay. I got some DVDs,
and I thought
we'd just stay in.

693
00:46:30,654 --> 00:46:34,090
Oh, that's the pizza.
Can you get that
while I get the soda?

694
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:35,250
Yeah.

695
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:41,297
Hey, large pepperoni,
pineapple?

696
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:43,890
Yeah, how much?
$14.65.

697
00:46:47,437 --> 00:46:51,271
Dude, you get any action
on this job?

698
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,007
What are you talking about?

699
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:56,705
You know,
you ever get some ass?

700
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,145
Like in those porn movies.

701
00:46:58,215 --> 00:47:00,615
Deliver a pizza
to some desperate housewife.
Tap that?

702
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:02,311
That never happens
in real life.

703
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:04,877
You should try
being the quarterback.

704
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:09,515
We get ass up the ass.

705
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:15,254
I mean...
Well, you know what I mean.

706
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,960
Yeah,
I know what you mean.
All right.

707
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:19,900
Here, you know what?
Keep the change, dude.

708
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:21,437
Dude, thanks.

709
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:25,066
That's the least I can do.
Your job sucks. Loser.

710
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:26,768
Dick.

711
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,038
Asshole.

712
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,478
What happened to you?

713
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:40,684
I spilled a little.

714
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:46,157
What were you and Jess...
Guys talking about?

715
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,292
What, the...

716
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:51,297
Pizza.
What, with the pizza guy?

717
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:52,630
Yeah.
Oh.

718
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:56,194
Nothing. No,
I was just giving him
a hard time, that's all.

719
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,767
I heard what you said, Brad.

720
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:02,972
Britney, I was just
screwing with him, okay?
It was a joke.

721
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:04,942
Well, it didn't sound
like a joke.

722
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:08,781
Well, it was, okay?
Now, you better turn
that frown upside down

723
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:11,184
'cause that's
gonna put wrinkles
in your pretty little head.

724
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:15,419
And it's gonna look perfect
for when we take pictures
at the homecoming dance.

725
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:23,666
<i>So, you do realize
you're only one of many squads
auditioning for Rihanna?</i>

726
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,498
<i>Yeah, we know
there's a lot of competition,
but we're ready for them.</i>

727
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:30,529
Amber, I can't come to school
today, so you can lead
practice. But videotape it.

728
00:48:30,607 --> 00:48:31,733
No excuses, just do it.

729
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:34,368
<i>Is there anything
that makes your squad
stand out from the others?</i>

730
00:48:34,444 --> 00:48:36,105
<i>Yeah. We better.</i>

731
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:41,048
<i>And we really, really want
this. Not just for ourselves,
but for our schools.</i>

732
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:44,485
<i>Well, good luck,
Crenshaw Heights.</i>

733
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:47,451
Crenshaw Heights?

734
00:48:51,995 --> 00:48:55,294
<i>Hey, turn... Oh, my God!
I'm on TV! I'm on TV!</i>
