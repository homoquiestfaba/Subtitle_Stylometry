1
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,746
- I
had a dream about you.

2
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:52,252
Melanie, my babysitter
and my best friend.

3
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,265
In the dream I was your baby.

4
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:11,771
And it was just you and me.

5
00:01:11,773 --> 00:01:12,907
Together forever.

6
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:03,323
- Johnny?

7
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,027
- Come in!

8
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:09,595
- Honey, I just
talked to Melanie.

9
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:11,063
- Is she here?

10
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:13,766
- Not yet, she just called
to say she has to leave early

11
00:02:13,768 --> 00:02:14,934
today.
- Why?

12
00:02:14,936 --> 00:02:17,435
- Well one of her
clients is having a baby

13
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,605
so she needs to go help them.

14
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:22,008
But I can come home from
work and then you and me

15
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,411
can have a day together, okay?

16
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,714
- Okay.

17
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:41,827
- Listen, you're gonna
come outta this thing

18
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,261
a whole new person.

19
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,497
Yes, rebirth!

20
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,332
Yes.

21
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,001
Yeah, I know it's
loud, his mom wanted me

22
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:50,468
to take him to the park.

23
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,104
Hold on, you're not
filming me again, are you?

24
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:53,338
- No.

25
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,607
- Yeah, we've been
doing this whole thing

26
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:57,175
where we record a
video and then like

27
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,344
mouth along to the words.

28
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,115
Yeah, yeah, like a lip sync.

29
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,449
Anyway, um, cool.

30
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:09,423
Well, um, I'm gonna
be with him until six.

31
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:11,857
That's usually when
his mom comes home.

32
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:15,260
So, uh, I can be in
the city around eight

33
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:19,067
and we can get some dinner
and then get trashed.

34
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:28,040
- Hi, Melanie.
- Hi.

35
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:30,142
- Um, so-
- It's just hard to say

36
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:32,210
how long it will be before
they need me, I'm sorry.

37
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,378
- No, no, no.

38
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,547
It's the first
time it's happened.

39
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:35,781
They just keep texting you?

40
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:37,583
- Yeah,
every half hour.

41
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:39,585
It's her first baby, so-
- Right.

42
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:41,053
- She's nervous.

43
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:42,822
- Oh, um, hold on,
I just need to get this.

44
00:03:42,824 --> 00:03:44,657
Sure.

45
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,261
- Hi, this is Claire.

46
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,770
- Melanie, I feel
good when I'm with you.

47
00:03:56,938 --> 00:03:59,540
Outside there are
things that feel bad.

48
00:04:00,742 --> 00:04:02,844
Like kids who laugh at you

49
00:04:03,945 --> 00:04:06,145
or say you look like a girl.

50
00:04:06,147 --> 00:04:07,682
Like that's a bad thing.

51
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,086
But when we're home
it's just me and you.

52
00:04:13,755 --> 00:04:15,087
- He's
really gonna miss you.

53
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:16,689
- I know,
it's a bummer.

54
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:18,090
- I mean, I'm
gonna miss you too,

55
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,457
but this is a big
moment for you.

56
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,660
- Yeah, totally.

57
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:23,829
- So, uh, will
you just be working

58
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:25,998
with the same midwife now or...?

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,633
- Well, I
actually just joined

60
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:29,101
this natural birth collective.

61
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,302
- Oh, cool.
- So I'll give you a call

62
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,905
if they need me, but...

63
00:04:32,907 --> 00:04:35,273
- All right.
- I mean, who knows.

64
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,209
- Bye, Johnny.
- Bye, Mom!

65
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:39,245
- And remember our
deal, some time outside today.

66
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:40,780
- I know!

67
00:04:40,782 --> 00:04:43,551
- Okay, I'll see you later.
- Bye.

68
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:49,555
- And...smile.

69
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:22,690
- Okay, you ready?

70
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:30,296
Pump it up.

71
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:46,779
- What is it?

72
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:50,448
- It's a video.
- Let me see.

73
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,320
- Uh, looks freaky.

74
00:05:54,322 --> 00:05:55,921
- I'm freaky.

75
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:04,063
- Free-spirit
meditation, an introduction.

76
00:06:04,065 --> 00:06:07,700
Part one, what is free
spirit meditation?

77
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:12,707
We are not individuals because
we are each of us, divisible.

78
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,708
We are body and spirit.

79
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,110
Free-spirit meditation
allows the spirit

80
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:21,647
to break free from the
limitations of physical form

81
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:25,152
and to seek experiences that
the body cannot provide.

82
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,756
Freedom, adventure, escape.

83
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:34,727
Part two, how can I do
free-spirit meditation?

84
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:38,197
Find a comfortable
position, close your eyes,

85
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,598
slow your breath.

86
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,870
Visualize a light
and simply let go.

87
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:47,508
Let your spirit leave your
body and go to the light.

88
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:04,924
- Hi, Sharon.

89
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:06,158
- Hey, Melanie.
- Hi.

90
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,359
- Hi, Priya,
how are you feeling?

91
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:08,560
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

92
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:11,397
I really didn't sleep
at all last night.

93
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,665
- Yeah?

94
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:14,099
How far apart are
the contractions?

95
00:07:15,336 --> 00:07:17,736
- Maybe um-
- 15, 16 minutes.

96
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,705
- Okay, good.

97
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:21,407
All right, I'm gonna
call Johnny's mom,

98
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:24,143
and when she gets
home I can leave

99
00:07:24,145 --> 00:07:25,811
and I'll go home and shower and

100
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:27,246
then I'll come over-
- Can I come?

101
00:07:27,248 --> 00:07:28,580
- In a little while.
- Yeah, that sounds good.

102
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:31,083
- Can I come too?
- Johnny, we're talking, okay?

103
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:33,018
- But I can help.

104
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,287
- Oh, and my legs
have been cramping up.

105
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,056
- Um, yeah.
- It kinda hurts.

106
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:39,224
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I was just saying

107
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:41,093
to Priya I wish I
could go into her body

108
00:07:41,095 --> 00:07:42,528
and do the hard part for her.

109
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,363
- Uh, yeah.
- Right?

110
00:07:44,365 --> 00:07:47,266
Well, until I get there,
lie down and rest,

111
00:07:47,268 --> 00:07:49,735
maybe go outside for
a walk if you can.

112
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:55,076
Maybe, uh...

113
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:57,475
- Sorry this
is such bad timing,

114
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,944
I know you probably
just got to work.

115
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:01,180
- All right, I'm just
looking at one thing here.

116
00:08:01,182 --> 00:08:03,315
You know what, I actually think
I can get back to the house

117
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:04,316
in an hour and a half.

118
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,551
Is that gonna work?

119
00:08:05,553 --> 00:08:07,052
- Yeah,
that should be fine.

120
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:09,355
- Oh, have you
guys gone outside at all?

121
00:08:09,357 --> 00:08:10,823
He promised me
that he would spend

122
00:08:10,825 --> 00:08:12,791
just a little time in the park.

123
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:15,594
- I know.
- Good boy.

124
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:33,445
Close your eyes.

125
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:34,915
Slow your breath.

126
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:38,753
Visualize a light.

127
00:08:42,056 --> 00:08:43,389
Let go.

128
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,094
Whoa.

129
00:09:23,164 --> 00:09:24,565
This is so weird.

130
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:29,970
Wait.

131
00:09:40,448 --> 00:09:41,847
Whoa.

132
00:09:46,487 --> 00:09:48,089
- Johnny?

133
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:56,997
Hello?

134
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:04,369
Are you up there?

135
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:16,917
Oh, hey, there you are.

136
00:10:17,852 --> 00:10:19,586
Want a smoothie?

137
00:10:19,588 --> 00:10:21,186
Mm-hm.

138
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:23,523
- Free-spirit
meditation allows you to send

139
00:10:23,525 --> 00:10:25,891
your spirit into other beings.

140
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:29,697
Animals, plants,
inanimate objects.

141
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:34,700
You can even send your
spirit into another person,

142
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:37,304
leaving your body
alive but catatonic.

143
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:41,740
When you enter another
human, your spirit takes over

144
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:44,611
their conscious mind
and the host's spirit

145
00:10:44,613 --> 00:10:46,615
sinks down into
the subconscious.

146
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:51,450
Now you can see through
someone else's eyes,

147
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:53,685
speak with their voice.

148
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:55,422
You can make a
home of a new body.

149
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:58,627
It's an experience
unlike any other.

150
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:01,530
Are you ready?

151
00:11:04,298 --> 00:11:05,464
- Melanie?

152
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:06,333
- Yeah?

153
00:11:07,368 --> 00:11:09,468
- Why do you like being a doula?

154
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,339
- Um, why do you ask?

155
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,806
- I don't know.

156
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:18,412
- Well, I like being
so close to birth

157
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:23,315
and I like-
- Well maybe you could

158
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:26,485
be my babysitter and be a doula.

159
00:11:26,487 --> 00:11:27,321
Like do both.

160
00:11:29,624 --> 00:11:30,457
- I wish I could.

161
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:34,627
But, you know, sometimes
you gotta let go

162
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:39,431
of who you were to
become who you wanna be.

163
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:40,467
Does that make sense?

164
00:11:58,219 --> 00:12:00,419
- I wish
I could be your smoothie,

165
00:12:00,421 --> 00:12:04,323
because then you'd
digest me and I'd become

166
00:12:04,325 --> 00:12:05,993
a part of your body.

167
00:12:11,465 --> 00:12:13,633
And we'd always be together.

168
00:13:36,718 --> 00:13:38,884
- Johnny?

169
00:14:20,461 --> 00:14:21,328
Hello?

170
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:28,770
Is this hide and seek?

171
00:14:31,506 --> 00:14:35,744
- Melanie,
I'm right behind you.

172
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:47,020
- Johnny?

173
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:51,925
Let's go!

174
00:14:59,801 --> 00:15:00,635
Okay.

175
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:28,962
Oh.

176
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:41,741
I wonder where Johnny could be.

177
00:16:06,935 --> 00:16:09,269
- Oh wow.

178
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:15,442
I'm Melanie.

179
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:24,786
That's my voice.

180
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:58,597
Let go.

181
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:00,533
Hello?

182
00:20:03,004 --> 00:20:03,838
Anybody home?

183
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:16,649
Hey.

184
00:20:16,651 --> 00:20:17,484
- Hi.

185
00:20:18,986 --> 00:20:20,318
- Where's Johnny?

186
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,488
- Johnny, he's sleeping.

187
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,157
- Oh, really?

188
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:26,792
He never takes a nap.

189
00:20:26,794 --> 00:20:29,628
- Um, uh huh.

190
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,262
- Are you okay?

191
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:32,732
- Yes.

192
00:20:32,734 --> 00:20:34,066
- All right, I'm gonna
go check on him upstairs.

193
00:20:34,068 --> 00:20:34,902
- No!

194
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:39,306
I have to show you something.

195
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,743
- What?

196
00:20:44,112 --> 00:20:45,580
- It's a surprise.

197
00:20:46,581 --> 00:20:48,647
- Oh, okay.

198
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:51,384
Uh, I'm gonna go to
the bathroom first.

199
00:21:41,702 --> 00:21:44,272
He has a little crush on
you, did you know that?

200
00:21:45,573 --> 00:21:49,374
I actually found a letter.

201
00:21:49,376 --> 00:21:52,611
I found it hidden in his drawer.

202
00:21:52,613 --> 00:21:53,948
Did he ever give it to you?

203
00:21:55,783 --> 00:21:57,850
Oh, I wish I could
remember what it said.

204
00:21:57,852 --> 00:21:59,685
Oh, it was so cute.

205
00:21:59,687 --> 00:22:01,722
Um-
- That was his private letter.

206
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,225
- I guess it was.

207
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:09,664
He never used to hide
anything from me.

208
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:14,166
It's silly, but I worry
that he feels closer

209
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:15,870
to you than he does to me.

210
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:23,311
Anyway, uh, you had something
that you wanted to show me?

211
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,814
- Yes.

212
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,861
Here, Johnny drew this.

213
00:22:41,863 --> 00:22:43,562
- Oh!

214
00:22:43,564 --> 00:22:45,030
- Yeah.
- That's nice.

215
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:46,899
- Yeah, it's nice.

216
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:51,906
Yeah, he did the, he did
the house, that's the head.

217
00:22:53,341 --> 00:22:57,377
And the house is the head
and the windows are the eyes.

218
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,915
- Oh, there's a
little boy inside.

219
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:02,617
- Yeah.

220
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,289
- Well, you probably
have to run.

221
00:23:09,156 --> 00:23:09,991
- Huh?

222
00:23:10,925 --> 00:23:12,558
- Your client.

223
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,726
- Oh.
- Oh, no, no, no.

224
00:23:13,728 --> 00:23:14,960
It's all good.

225
00:23:14,962 --> 00:23:16,262
I took the afternoon
off, you go ahead.

226
00:23:16,264 --> 00:23:17,730
Johnny and I will
spend the day together.

227
00:23:17,732 --> 00:23:21,202
- No, I don't have to go.

228
00:23:22,637 --> 00:23:26,207
- Oh, I thought you
said she was already in labor.

229
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:29,608
- Not anymore.

230
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,678
- Huh.
- Yeah.

231
00:23:31,545 --> 00:23:35,583
So, um, you can, you can leave.

232
00:23:38,052 --> 00:23:38,886
- Oh.

233
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,955
Well, uh...

234
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:45,324
Yeah, I do have some
errands that I can run.

235
00:23:45,326 --> 00:23:47,860
Oh, I would really
love to go to the gym.

236
00:23:47,862 --> 00:23:49,328
- Uh huh.

237
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:53,265
- Um, yeah, all right, great.

238
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:55,301
- Great.
- Yeah, thank you.

239
00:23:56,604 --> 00:23:57,972
- You're welcome.

240
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:00,673
- Hey, so you're
sure it's all right

241
00:24:00,675 --> 00:24:02,241
for me to head out?

242
00:24:02,243 --> 00:24:03,742
- Yeah, I don't mind.

243
00:24:03,744 --> 00:24:04,743
- All right.

244
00:24:04,745 --> 00:24:07,313
Well, I really appreciate it.

245
00:24:07,315 --> 00:24:12,086
Oh, so uh, did Johnny
get any park time today?

246
00:24:13,354 --> 00:24:16,555
- Uh, no.
- Okay, because he and I

247
00:24:16,557 --> 00:24:18,857
made a deal just a
little time outside.

248
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:21,162
He really has to-
- I know!

249
00:24:23,264 --> 00:24:26,365
Um, he told me.

250
00:24:26,367 --> 00:24:28,667
- Oh, he did?

251
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:30,468
Good, okay.

252
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,406
OK, here's my...

253
00:24:34,408 --> 00:24:36,976
Well I will see
you later tonight.

254
00:24:36,978 --> 00:24:38,711
- Yeah, okay, bye.

255
00:24:38,713 --> 00:24:39,613
Love y...

256
00:24:41,983 --> 00:24:43,317
- I love you too, Melanie.

257
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:46,187
Bye.

258
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:34,206
- Hi, um,
why is there a piece

259
00:29:34,208 --> 00:29:38,544
of white cloth in my vagina?

260
00:29:38,546 --> 00:29:40,412
- Okay,
here's what I found.

261
00:29:40,414 --> 00:29:43,015
Tampon, noun, a plug
of absorbent material

262
00:29:43,017 --> 00:29:46,086
used to soak up menstrual
blood during a woman's period.

263
00:29:48,022 --> 00:29:51,023
- What
is woman's period?

264
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:58,096
- The
problem with me being in you

265
00:29:58,098 --> 00:30:00,134
is that we can't talk.

266
00:30:04,004 --> 00:30:07,107
But I can pretend.

267
00:30:10,911 --> 00:30:12,077
- Hi, Johnny.

268
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:15,414
Melanie, wow.

269
00:30:15,416 --> 00:30:17,484
You just look so amazing.

270
00:30:18,385 --> 00:30:19,851
- I know.

271
00:30:19,853 --> 00:30:23,756
- Maybe
you should go outside.

272
00:30:23,758 --> 00:30:25,725
- I just wanna
stay home with you.

273
00:30:25,727 --> 00:30:27,794
- Come
on, go show everybody

274
00:30:27,796 --> 00:30:29,096
how beautiful you are.

275
00:30:30,364 --> 00:30:32,364
What are you afraid of?

276
00:30:32,366 --> 00:30:35,503
Nobody's gonna laugh
at you, I promise.

277
00:30:36,538 --> 00:30:38,673
Come on, you're Melanie.

278
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:42,374
You're the smartest and coolest

279
00:30:42,376 --> 00:30:45,645
and the prettiest
girl in the world.

280
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:28,883
Melanie.

281
00:32:31,084 --> 00:32:32,252
Where are you?

282
00:32:34,556 --> 00:32:36,223
Somewhere far away?

283
00:32:41,395 --> 00:32:44,231
I wish we were
together right now.

284
00:33:05,887 --> 00:33:08,621
- Um, hello?
- Yeah, okay, good, good.

285
00:33:08,623 --> 00:33:12,658
Hey, Melanie.
- Yes, this is me, Melanie.

286
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,392
Who is this?
- It's Sharon.

287
00:33:14,394 --> 00:33:16,127
So, Priya's water broke.
- Let me talk to her.

288
00:33:16,129 --> 00:33:17,563
- What?
- Let me talk to her.

289
00:33:17,565 --> 00:33:19,030
- Here, I'm
gonna pass her the phone.

290
00:33:19,032 --> 00:33:20,967
- Melanie, are
you still babysitting?

291
00:33:20,969 --> 00:33:23,636
- Um, no, I left from there.

292
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:26,639
- Great, so you're on
your way over here now, right?

293
00:33:26,641 --> 00:33:29,374
Sharon just finished
filling the birth pool,

294
00:33:29,376 --> 00:33:32,110
but I don't know if I
should get in now or...

295
00:33:32,112 --> 00:33:33,913
What do you think?

296
00:33:33,915 --> 00:33:38,518
- What do I think?

297
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,451
- Hey, it's me again.

298
00:33:39,453 --> 00:33:40,953
Priya's having a contraction.

299
00:33:40,955 --> 00:33:42,120
We'll see you soon, yeah?

300
00:33:42,122 --> 00:33:44,289
- Yeah, uh...

301
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:45,725
- You're
the best, Melanie.

302
00:33:45,727 --> 00:33:46,728
Thanks, bye.

303
00:33:48,462 --> 00:33:50,028
- Bye.

304
00:33:59,807 --> 00:34:03,210
Come on!

305
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,346
Were they...?

306
00:34:08,348 --> 00:34:09,584
Were they laughing at me?

307
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:53,193
- Melanie?

308
00:34:56,129 --> 00:34:57,597
It's Sunita.

309
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:58,864
From high school.

310
00:34:58,866 --> 00:35:00,100
Oh my god, come here.

311
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:03,903
What's going on?

312
00:35:03,905 --> 00:35:05,504
- What do you mean?

313
00:35:05,506 --> 00:35:07,707
- Like, what
are you up to these days?

314
00:35:07,709 --> 00:35:09,075
- Oh.

315
00:35:09,077 --> 00:35:11,644
I'm a babysitter.
- Yeah?

316
00:35:11,646 --> 00:35:12,845
- For Johnny.

317
00:35:12,847 --> 00:35:14,582
He's probably my best friend.

318
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,415
- That's cool.

319
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:18,951
- Uh huh, it's cool.

320
00:35:18,953 --> 00:35:21,889
- I've been really busy with-
- I got woman's period today.

321
00:35:23,223 --> 00:35:25,727
But it's okay because
I had a period tampon.

322
00:35:29,864 --> 00:35:31,298
Do you have period today?

323
00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:34,002
- No.

324
00:35:36,436 --> 00:35:39,105
Wow, well, you
look really great.

325
00:35:39,107 --> 00:35:40,773
- No, I don't.

326
00:35:40,775 --> 00:35:43,111
I have to go home and
clean my face and stuff.

327
00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:46,313
- Oh, uh,
where do you live?

328
00:35:47,815 --> 00:35:49,548
- Where do I live?

329
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,119
- Like, your apartment?

330
00:35:52,152 --> 00:35:53,420
- My apartment?

331
00:35:57,424 --> 00:35:58,258
- Melanie?

332
00:35:59,426 --> 00:36:00,993
- I have to go now, goodbye.

333
00:40:19,353 --> 00:40:21,654
- Melanie?

334
00:40:21,656 --> 00:40:22,489
Hello?

335
00:40:23,724 --> 00:40:25,991
- You can make
a home of a new body.

336
00:40:25,993 --> 00:40:27,860
...takes over and
the host sinks down

337
00:40:27,862 --> 00:40:29,028
into the subconscious.

338
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:32,497
Part four, exiting a host body.

339
00:40:32,499 --> 00:40:36,802
Once your spirit is in another
body, exiting is simple.

340
00:40:36,804 --> 00:40:39,805
All you have to do is let go.

341
00:40:39,807 --> 00:40:42,641
Imagine your spirit
is holding a mirror.

342
00:40:42,643 --> 00:40:46,312
In the reflection you
see someone else's face.

343
00:40:46,314 --> 00:40:47,746
Let them go.

344
00:40:47,748 --> 00:40:49,315
Let the mirror f...

345
00:40:49,317 --> 00:40:52,284
Part five, what do I do if I'm
stuck in an inanimate object?

346
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:54,753
Part six, where
should I keep my body

347
00:40:54,755 --> 00:40:56,522
while my spirit is...

348
00:40:56,524 --> 00:40:59,892
Part seven, how can
I communicate with
a human host spirit?

349
00:40:59,894 --> 00:41:02,194
While your spirit
is in a host body,

350
00:41:02,196 --> 00:41:04,330
you can make contact
with the host spirit

351
00:41:04,332 --> 00:41:06,532
by opening the subconscious.

352
00:41:06,534 --> 00:41:09,868
Take a deep breath,
clear your mind.

353
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:14,875
Think 'open subconscious'
or 'close subconscious'.

354
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:19,411
However, once you
begin letting go,

355
00:41:19,413 --> 00:41:21,814
the ability to
communicate shuts down

356
00:41:21,816 --> 00:41:24,984
as the free spirit detaches-
- Open subconscious.

357
00:41:24,986 --> 00:41:28,087
- Can anyone hear me?
- Open subconscious.

358
00:41:28,089 --> 00:41:29,521
- Hello?
- Melanie?

359
00:41:29,523 --> 00:41:31,190
Oh, Johnny.

360
00:41:31,192 --> 00:41:32,691
What is going on?

361
00:41:32,693 --> 00:41:37,262
I can hear your voice but I
can't really see anything.

362
00:41:37,264 --> 00:41:39,932
- Oh,
I think the video said

363
00:41:39,934 --> 00:41:41,767
you're in the subconscious.
- Wait, wait, what video?

364
00:41:41,769 --> 00:41:45,604
The free-spirit one.

365
00:41:45,606 --> 00:41:50,578
I did what it said and my
spirit floated into your body.

366
00:41:52,646 --> 00:41:53,545
- What?

367
00:41:53,547 --> 00:41:54,713
- I know, right?

368
00:41:54,715 --> 00:41:55,848
It's crazy.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

369
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:57,483
I can hear my voice.

370
00:41:57,485 --> 00:42:00,219
Are you speaking in my voice?

371
00:42:00,221 --> 00:42:01,453
- Oh, sorry.

372
00:42:01,455 --> 00:42:03,088
Oh, no, no, that's okay.

373
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:06,392
So you meditated into...

374
00:42:06,394 --> 00:42:07,760
That's, wow.

375
00:42:07,762 --> 00:42:08,894
Are you some kind of...

376
00:42:08,896 --> 00:42:10,262
Wait, is that my phone?

377
00:42:10,264 --> 00:42:12,664
- It says Sharon.
- Oh my god.

378
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:15,269
Um, yeah, answer it I guess.

379
00:42:17,238 --> 00:42:18,637
- Hi.
- Hey.

380
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:20,205
Priya keeps asking when
you're getting here.

381
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:21,573
I thought you were on your way?

382
00:42:21,575 --> 00:42:23,642
- Oh, my God.
- Um.

383
00:42:23,644 --> 00:42:24,910
- Uh, just
say you'll come right over.

384
00:42:24,912 --> 00:42:26,445
- You'll come right over.
- What?

385
00:42:26,447 --> 00:42:28,347
- I'll come right over.
- I'll come right over.

386
00:42:28,349 --> 00:42:30,115
- Okay,
hurry if you can.

387
00:42:30,117 --> 00:42:31,984
Oh my god, whoa.

388
00:42:31,986 --> 00:42:33,052
Um.

389
00:42:33,054 --> 00:42:34,753
Is someone knocking on the door?

390
00:42:34,755 --> 00:42:36,657
Oh, I can go look.

391
00:42:37,526 --> 00:42:38,857
- Hey, cutie pie, you home?

392
00:42:38,859 --> 00:42:40,659
I hear Tom's voice.

393
00:42:40,661 --> 00:42:43,562
Wait, why is he at your house?

394
00:42:43,564 --> 00:42:45,599
I'm not at my house.

395
00:42:46,467 --> 00:42:48,567
Um, I'm at your apartment.

396
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:49,701
How did y...

397
00:42:49,703 --> 00:42:51,203
Why are you at my apartment?

398
00:42:51,205 --> 00:42:53,407
- Well,
it's kind of like that

399
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:59,111
you're at your apartment
'cause I'm you, remember?

400
00:42:59,113 --> 00:42:59,945
No, no, no.

401
00:42:59,947 --> 00:43:01,647
You're not me

402
00:43:01,649 --> 00:43:02,748
you're just-

403
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:03,649
- Bless you.
- Okay, you know what?

404
00:43:03,651 --> 00:43:05,317
Just tell him to leave.

405
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:07,653
- But I
thought he was your boyfriend.

406
00:43:07,655 --> 00:43:10,489
- Shugs, you gonna let me it?
- No, he's not my boyfriend.

407
00:43:10,491 --> 00:43:15,160
We just, um, sometimes-
- Melanie.

408
00:43:15,162 --> 00:43:15,994
Yeah, I'm not gonna

409
00:43:15,996 --> 00:43:16,962
explain this to you.

410
00:43:16,964 --> 00:43:17,896
Wait, are you opening the door?

411
00:43:17,898 --> 00:43:18,933
Don't open the door.

412
00:43:20,501 --> 00:43:21,335
- Hi.

413
00:43:22,403 --> 00:43:23,237
- Hello.

414
00:43:25,306 --> 00:43:26,839
- I like that dress.

415
00:43:26,841 --> 00:43:29,610
- Johnny,
tell him to go away right now.

416
00:43:31,112 --> 00:43:32,778
- Go away.

417
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,379
- You want me to go?

418
00:43:34,381 --> 00:43:35,914
Okay.

419
00:43:35,916 --> 00:43:36,882
Is he gone?

420
00:43:36,884 --> 00:43:38,217
- Not yet.

421
00:43:38,219 --> 00:43:39,718
- Not yet.
- You know what?

422
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,854
Try not to answer me out loud.

423
00:43:41,856 --> 00:43:43,558
Right, sorry.

424
00:43:44,425 --> 00:43:45,259
- No.

425
00:43:47,394 --> 00:43:49,695
You have to go away.

426
00:43:49,697 --> 00:43:51,096
- Okay, I will.

427
00:43:51,098 --> 00:43:54,466
I just gotta go to the
bathroom first if that's okay.

428
00:43:54,468 --> 00:43:56,235
- Um.
- Wait, what's going on?

429
00:43:56,237 --> 00:43:57,471
- I gotta go bad.

430
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,105
- Whoa.

431
00:44:00,107 --> 00:44:01,608
Whoa, did you let him in?

432
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:02,975
- He's
just going to the bathroom.

433
00:44:02,977 --> 00:44:07,346
Oh, this is not good.

434
00:44:07,348 --> 00:44:11,250
How did this even...?

435
00:44:11,252 --> 00:44:15,888
Okay, I gotta figure out how...

436
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:17,256
What, are you
listening to him pee?

437
00:44:17,258 --> 00:44:19,827
- What? No.

438
00:44:20,861 --> 00:44:22,394
Okay, okay.

439
00:44:22,396 --> 00:44:25,497
When he comes out of
there, do not engage.

440
00:44:25,499 --> 00:44:27,466
Just get him to leave.

441
00:44:27,468 --> 00:44:28,934
- Fine by me.

442
00:44:28,936 --> 00:44:31,336
- Don't
even look at him, okay?

443
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:33,372
- Sure, easy.

444
00:44:33,374 --> 00:44:34,475
- There's no music on.

445
00:44:38,613 --> 00:44:39,847
That's really unlike you.

446
00:44:46,655 --> 00:44:47,920
What is he doing?

447
00:44:47,922 --> 00:44:50,756
I think he's dancing?

448
00:44:50,758 --> 00:44:52,257
- You like the way
I move my body?

449
00:44:52,259 --> 00:44:53,292
- Oh no.

450
00:44:53,294 --> 00:44:56,361
Okay, yeah, this has to stop.

451
00:44:56,363 --> 00:44:57,296
- Dance with me.

452
00:44:57,298 --> 00:44:58,030
- No.

453
00:44:58,032 --> 00:44:59,765
No you will not.

454
00:44:59,767 --> 00:45:01,233
Go turn off the music.

455
00:45:01,235 --> 00:45:02,036
- Come on!

456
00:45:04,805 --> 00:45:05,873
There you go.

457
00:45:13,147 --> 00:45:14,248
There you go.

458
00:45:16,618 --> 00:45:18,817
- Hey,
turn off the music right now.

459
00:45:18,819 --> 00:45:21,320
- I
was just walking over

460
00:45:21,322 --> 00:45:22,888
there to do that.

461
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:24,890
- Aren't you supposed to be
looking after little Jimmy?

462
00:45:24,892 --> 00:45:26,091
- Johnny.

463
00:45:26,093 --> 00:45:28,727
- Johnny, right.
- Don't talk to him!

464
00:45:28,729 --> 00:45:29,928
- He called me Jimmy.

465
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:31,065
- What was that?

466
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:34,733
- I
didn't say anything.

467
00:45:34,735 --> 00:45:38,870
- Okay, I
need you to stay in your head.

468
00:45:38,872 --> 00:45:39,773
- Okay.

469
00:45:41,775 --> 00:45:44,276
I'm gonna go get some water now.

470
00:45:44,278 --> 00:45:45,110
What? Wait.

471
00:45:45,112 --> 00:45:46,713
Why is he even here?

472
00:45:46,715 --> 00:45:48,347
Like how did that happen?

473
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:49,448
Why don't you like him?

474
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:51,817
- Johnny.
- I think he's nice.

475
00:45:51,819 --> 00:45:53,252
Okay, listen to me.

476
00:45:53,254 --> 00:45:57,022
I need you to trust me
that this can go very badly

477
00:45:57,024 --> 00:46:01,594
very quickly, so I need you to
get him out of my apartment.

478
00:46:01,596 --> 00:46:04,599
- Okay, fine.
- Um, Tom?

479
00:46:06,133 --> 00:46:07,799
- I'm in here!

480
00:46:07,801 --> 00:46:09,134
In the bedroom.

481
00:46:09,136 --> 00:46:11,003
- Oh. What?

482
00:46:11,005 --> 00:46:12,404
Um, Melanie?

483
00:46:12,406 --> 00:46:13,905
What is happening?

484
00:46:13,907 --> 00:46:16,008
- He's on
the bed and his pants are off.

485
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:17,276
- Oh no.

486
00:46:17,278 --> 00:46:19,011
- Can we cuddle
just for a minute?

487
00:46:19,013 --> 00:46:22,515
- Oh, my god!
- Um, no because

488
00:46:22,517 --> 00:46:23,716
you have to go now.

489
00:46:23,718 --> 00:46:25,384
- What's
going on with you?

490
00:46:25,386 --> 00:46:26,885
You're not acting like yourself.

491
00:46:26,887 --> 00:46:30,457
- Okay, well, I am myself.

492
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:33,458
- Are you breaking up with me?

493
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:34,459
Breaking up with you?

494
00:46:34,461 --> 00:46:36,596
Were we even dating?

495
00:46:36,598 --> 00:46:38,063
- You don't gotta say anything.

496
00:46:38,065 --> 00:46:39,532
- I
think I hurt his feelings.

497
00:46:39,534 --> 00:46:41,001
Just let him go.

498
00:47:04,726 --> 00:47:05,560
Johnny?

499
00:47:08,195 --> 00:47:09,363
What was that?

500
00:47:10,431 --> 00:47:11,265
- Oh no.

501
00:47:13,535 --> 00:47:15,434
- Wanna
tell me what's going on?

502
00:47:15,436 --> 00:47:17,402
- He's, uh...

503
00:47:17,404 --> 00:47:18,671
He's hurt.

504
00:47:18,673 --> 00:47:19,905
What do you mean hurt?

505
00:47:19,907 --> 00:47:21,473
I think I killed him.

506
00:47:21,475 --> 00:47:23,810
- What?

507
00:47:23,812 --> 00:47:25,310
I am so sorry.

508
00:47:25,312 --> 00:47:28,113
- Call 911.

509
00:47:28,115 --> 00:47:30,550
Johnny? Go, go, go.

510
00:47:30,552 --> 00:47:32,984
- I am!

511
00:47:32,986 --> 00:47:34,522
- Oh, Tom.

512
00:47:39,026 --> 00:47:40,859
- 911,
what's your emergency?

513
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:42,361
- I killed somebody.
- Alright.

514
00:47:42,363 --> 00:47:43,895
- Don't say that!
- I mean-

515
00:47:43,897 --> 00:47:45,230
Just say someone is hurt

516
00:47:45,232 --> 00:47:46,733
and needs medical attention.

517
00:47:46,735 --> 00:47:48,066
- Someone...medical tension.

518
00:47:48,068 --> 00:47:49,401
- Okay.
- Did you check to see

519
00:47:49,403 --> 00:47:51,203
if he's breathing?
- What's your location, ma'am?

520
00:47:51,205 --> 00:47:53,305
- 165 Wisteria 4G.

521
00:47:53,307 --> 00:47:55,207
- 4D.
- Okay, stay on the

522
00:47:55,209 --> 00:47:56,475
phone with me.
- Did you check to see

523
00:47:56,477 --> 00:47:57,844
if he's breathing?
- Um, no.

524
00:47:57,846 --> 00:47:59,044
Yes, don't hang up.

525
00:47:59,046 --> 00:48:00,479
- I won't, I won't.
- You have to.

526
00:48:00,481 --> 00:48:02,548
Go see if he's breathing.
- Ma'am, I need you

527
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:04,717
to stay on the line.
- Just go check on him.

528
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:06,586
- Okay, uh...

529
00:48:12,292 --> 00:48:13,127
Oh.

530
00:48:17,097 --> 00:48:19,498
- Hey.
- Oh, thank god.

531
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:20,934
- Messed up your towel.

532
00:48:21,935 --> 00:48:23,368
- Oh.

533
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:24,204
- Is that 911?

534
00:48:26,974 --> 00:48:30,342
Hi, I'm the guy
she's talking about.

535
00:48:30,344 --> 00:48:34,814
No, I just, I um, I fell down-

536
00:48:34,816 --> 00:48:37,149
Okay, that was really f...

537
00:48:37,151 --> 00:48:39,819
Messed up, wow.

538
00:48:39,821 --> 00:48:42,454
Okay, all right, I gotta focus.

539
00:48:42,456 --> 00:48:46,291
You have to get out of my body.

540
00:48:46,293 --> 00:48:49,327
I have to get to the birth and-

541
00:48:49,329 --> 00:48:52,063
Close subconscious.

542
00:48:52,065 --> 00:48:53,398
What'd you say?

543
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,333
Close subconscious.

544
00:48:55,335 --> 00:48:57,936
- Johnny...

545
00:48:57,938 --> 00:49:01,375
- No, no, don't send an
ambulance, I'm good, I'm good.

546
00:49:02,544 --> 00:49:04,879
Okay, I will.

547
00:49:07,147 --> 00:49:08,215
I'm gonna hang up now.

548
00:50:49,851 --> 00:50:51,151
I should probably go.

549
00:51:48,509 --> 00:51:52,277
Open subconscious.

550
00:51:52,279 --> 00:51:54,145
Johnny, what just happened?

551
00:51:54,147 --> 00:51:55,848
- I
just thought I could-

552
00:51:55,850 --> 00:51:56,816
No, you know what?

553
00:51:56,818 --> 00:51:58,084
I don't have time for this.

554
00:51:58,086 --> 00:52:00,118
You have to get out
of my body right now.

555
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,021
- Well,
the video said to get out

556
00:52:02,023 --> 00:52:03,355
I have to let go.

557
00:52:03,357 --> 00:52:05,024
Okay, then, let go.

558
00:52:05,026 --> 00:52:06,491
What does that mean?

559
00:52:06,493 --> 00:52:07,425
- How
am I supposed to know?

560
00:52:07,427 --> 00:52:09,294
You are the one who did this.

561
00:52:09,296 --> 00:52:11,631
- Well,
I just, I don't know.

562
00:52:11,633 --> 00:52:13,001
Okay, all right.

563
00:52:14,201 --> 00:52:16,035
You get that this
is my life, right?

564
00:52:16,037 --> 00:52:17,737
That this is my job?
- I know.

565
00:52:17,739 --> 00:52:19,071
So why did you do this?

566
00:52:19,073 --> 00:52:21,172
- I don't know.
- No, I don't believe that.

567
00:52:21,174 --> 00:52:22,440
Why did you do this?

568
00:52:22,442 --> 00:52:23,676
I said I don't know.

569
00:52:23,678 --> 00:52:25,176
Oh, okay, all right.

570
00:52:25,178 --> 00:52:27,880
So you just magically floated
into my body for no reason?

571
00:52:27,882 --> 00:52:29,982
- Well,
yeah, well you are the one

572
00:52:29,984 --> 00:52:31,984
who's leaving me just
like everybody else.

573
00:52:31,986 --> 00:52:33,385
- I'm not-
- You're never even gonna

574
00:52:33,387 --> 00:52:35,523
see me again, so
why do you care?

575
00:52:37,892 --> 00:52:40,225
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

576
00:52:40,227 --> 00:52:41,794
- It's
okay, just take a deep breath.

577
00:52:41,796 --> 00:52:45,064
- I
just, I just wanted to feel

578
00:52:45,066 --> 00:52:46,599
what it would be like to be you.

579
00:52:46,601 --> 00:52:48,934
Okay, okay.

580
00:52:48,936 --> 00:52:53,941
But you can't be somebody
else, you have to be you.

581
00:52:55,442 --> 00:52:56,909
- What
if I don't wanna be me?

582
00:52:56,911 --> 00:52:59,679
Well, you don't really know

583
00:52:59,681 --> 00:53:01,814
who you are yet.

584
00:53:01,816 --> 00:53:04,550
You get to choose
who you wanna be.

585
00:53:06,453 --> 00:53:07,920
Oh, God.

586
00:53:07,922 --> 00:53:12,058
Do you really think there
is nothing you can do

587
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:13,695
to fix this right now?

588
00:53:14,729 --> 00:53:16,227
- I don't...

589
00:53:16,229 --> 00:53:17,364
I don't know.
- Okay.

590
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:21,167
I think we have to
do this together.

591
00:53:21,169 --> 00:53:22,668
- You mean...

592
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:24,906
Wait, what do you mean?

593
00:53:33,981 --> 00:53:36,314
Melanie?
- Yeah?

594
00:53:36,316 --> 00:53:37,783
I'm nervous.

595
00:53:37,785 --> 00:53:39,350
- It's
totally normal to be nervous,

596
00:53:39,352 --> 00:53:41,120
but I'm right here.

597
00:53:41,122 --> 00:53:44,523
- I
don't think I can do this.

598
00:53:44,525 --> 00:53:47,459
Look, you just have to do

599
00:53:47,461 --> 00:53:49,731
what I tell you, okay?

600
00:53:51,933 --> 00:53:53,632
Okay?
- Yeah.

601
00:54:03,077 --> 00:54:05,044
- Was that you knocking?
- Yes.

602
00:54:05,046 --> 00:54:05,978
Yeah, okay,

603
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,179
they're not gonna hear that.

604
00:54:07,181 --> 00:54:08,781
You have to knock
way louder than that.

605
00:54:08,783 --> 00:54:10,315
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

606
00:54:10,317 --> 00:54:11,784
Way too loud.

607
00:54:11,786 --> 00:54:13,351
- You
said I should knock louder.

608
00:54:13,353 --> 00:54:15,286
- Melanie, finally.

609
00:54:15,288 --> 00:54:17,089
It took you forever.

610
00:54:17,091 --> 00:54:18,557
She's hugging me.

611
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,828
Okay, well, hug her back.

612
00:54:23,497 --> 00:54:24,899
- Priya's upstairs.

613
00:54:26,768 --> 00:54:28,500
Oh, could you close the door?

614
00:54:28,502 --> 00:54:29,635
- Oh.
- Her contractions have

615
00:54:29,637 --> 00:54:30,970
been getting really intense.

616
00:54:30,972 --> 00:54:32,738
I got your voicemail the last-
- Is that Melanie?

617
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:33,873
- Yeah.

618
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:34,709
Okay, come on.

619
00:54:41,516 --> 00:54:42,349
She's in here.

620
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,353
Hey.

621
00:54:47,354 --> 00:54:49,320
- Hey, Melanie.

622
00:54:49,322 --> 00:54:50,388
Say "Hi, Priya."

623
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:51,690
- Hi, Priya.

624
00:54:51,692 --> 00:54:53,826
- You need anything?

625
00:54:53,828 --> 00:54:54,727
- Mm-mm.
- Are you standing

626
00:54:54,729 --> 00:54:56,162
next to her?

627
00:54:56,164 --> 00:54:57,897
- Yes.

628
00:54:57,899 --> 00:54:59,165
- Say
"How are you feeling?"

629
00:54:59,167 --> 00:55:00,733
- How are you feeling?

630
00:55:00,735 --> 00:55:02,001
- We've been at
this a long time,

631
00:55:02,003 --> 00:55:04,402
but she's doing so good, really.

632
00:55:04,404 --> 00:55:05,738
- Thanks, sweetie.

633
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:07,773
I'm happy you're finally here.

634
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:11,043
- Yes, I'm here to be
your doula for you.

635
00:55:11,045 --> 00:55:12,477
Nope, don't improvise.

636
00:55:12,479 --> 00:55:14,445
- It's really
uncomfortable around here.

637
00:55:14,447 --> 00:55:17,883
I took a really long shower
and that helped but...

638
00:55:17,885 --> 00:55:20,353
Oh.
- Oh, breathe, baby.

639
00:55:21,856 --> 00:55:25,226
Should I rub her back?

640
00:55:26,661 --> 00:55:28,326
- I
think we need to apologize

641
00:55:28,328 --> 00:55:29,530
for being so late.

642
00:55:30,698 --> 00:55:32,631
- I need to move,
I need to walk.

643
00:55:32,633 --> 00:55:33,966
- Okay, are you sure?

644
00:55:33,968 --> 00:55:35,466
Let's go.
- Okay.

645
00:55:35,468 --> 00:55:36,535
- Say
"I'm sorry I'm so late".

646
00:55:36,537 --> 00:55:37,368
- I'm-
- Melanie, can you see

647
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:38,637
who that is please?

648
00:55:41,843 --> 00:55:43,542
- Ruby?
- Ruby is the midwife.

649
00:55:43,544 --> 00:55:45,611
- Oh, good!
- So...

650
00:55:45,613 --> 00:55:46,781
Yeah, answer it.

651
00:55:48,616 --> 00:55:50,516
- Hello?
- Hi, Sharon, is that you?

652
00:55:50,518 --> 00:55:52,151
- Can you
get me some juice?

653
00:55:52,153 --> 00:55:54,954
- Yeah, no, um, this is Melanie.

654
00:55:54,956 --> 00:55:57,623
- Oh, hey, Melanie.
- It's in the fridge!

655
00:55:57,625 --> 00:55:58,458
- Yes.

656
00:55:59,827 --> 00:56:01,093
- Listen, I planned
to be there by now.

657
00:56:01,095 --> 00:56:01,894
I probably should
have left earlier.

658
00:56:01,896 --> 00:56:03,329
How is everything going?

659
00:56:03,331 --> 00:56:04,997
How's Priya doing?

660
00:56:04,999 --> 00:56:06,298
- Just
say "Everything is fine".

661
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:08,133
- Everything's fine.

662
00:56:08,135 --> 00:56:09,400
- That's good.

663
00:56:09,402 --> 00:56:10,903
Look, I'm so sorry
I'm running late.

664
00:56:10,905 --> 00:56:12,972
I don't know how long it's
gonna take me to get there,

665
00:56:12,974 --> 00:56:14,506
traffic is terrible.

666
00:56:14,508 --> 00:56:15,774
- Shit.
- Shit.

667
00:56:15,776 --> 00:56:17,643
- I know.
- No, don't repeat everything!

668
00:56:17,645 --> 00:56:18,611
- No, don't rep...

669
00:56:18,613 --> 00:56:19,745
Oh.
- What?

670
00:56:19,747 --> 00:56:20,746
- Nothing.
- Look, call me if

671
00:56:20,748 --> 00:56:21,947
you need anything.

672
00:56:21,949 --> 00:56:23,282
I'll be there as
soon as I can, okay?

673
00:56:23,284 --> 00:56:25,117
- Okay.
- Oh, and one more thing...

674
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:27,753
- Look,
Johnny, this is getting

675
00:56:27,755 --> 00:56:31,957
really serious now.

676
00:56:31,959 --> 00:56:33,160
What was that?

677
00:56:34,629 --> 00:56:36,461
- Nothing.

678
00:56:36,463 --> 00:56:37,296
You know what?

679
00:56:37,298 --> 00:56:39,565
This is not gonna work.

680
00:56:39,567 --> 00:56:42,701
You've gotta try to
figure out how to let go.

681
00:56:42,703 --> 00:56:45,571
I am, I'm trying.

682
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:51,510
- You good?

683
00:56:51,512 --> 00:56:52,847
- Your phone.
- Oh.

684
00:56:53,814 --> 00:56:54,747
- Juice.
- Thanks.

685
00:56:54,749 --> 00:56:56,048
- Is Ruby close?

686
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:57,151
- Yes.
- Yes.

687
00:56:58,653 --> 00:57:00,119
- When's she getting here?

688
00:57:00,121 --> 00:57:01,320
She'll be here very soon.

689
00:57:01,322 --> 00:57:02,788
That's not true.

690
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:04,290
- Does this juice
have like a funny after taste?

691
00:57:04,292 --> 00:57:05,524
- She
will be here very soon,

692
00:57:05,526 --> 00:57:06,558
Johnny.
- No, she said she's stuck

693
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:07,660
in traffic.
- Say it.

694
00:57:07,662 --> 00:57:09,427
- She'll be here very soon.

695
00:57:09,429 --> 00:57:11,196
- Okay.
No, it tastes fine.

696
00:57:11,198 --> 00:57:12,463
- Really?
- Yes.

697
00:57:12,465 --> 00:57:14,434
You've said everything
tastes weird all day.

698
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:18,539
- Melanie, you try.

699
00:57:20,374 --> 00:57:22,541
It tastes kinda weird, right?

700
00:57:22,543 --> 00:57:24,009
Funky.

701
00:57:24,011 --> 00:57:25,210
- There's nothing
wrong with the juice!

702
00:57:25,212 --> 00:57:27,179
- Sweetie, can you
just get me my water?

703
00:57:27,181 --> 00:57:28,814
- Yeah, sure.

704
00:57:28,816 --> 00:57:30,149
- I'm gonna give
you my weight, okay?

705
00:57:30,151 --> 00:57:31,752
- Melanie.
- Oh God.

706
00:57:32,386 --> 00:57:34,253
- I
can't taste the juice.

707
00:57:34,255 --> 00:57:35,621
What do you mean?

708
00:57:35,623 --> 00:57:36,855
I don't know.

709
00:57:36,857 --> 00:57:38,458
It doesn't taste like anything.

710
00:57:39,627 --> 00:57:41,794
- Here,
honey. Your water.

711
00:57:41,796 --> 00:57:43,162
- I need to sit down.

712
00:57:43,164 --> 00:57:44,530
- Okay, come here.
- Yeah.

713
00:57:44,532 --> 00:57:46,031
Isn't that kinda weird?

714
00:57:46,033 --> 00:57:47,566
- Johnny-
- Here we go.

715
00:57:47,568 --> 00:57:49,500
- Don't
worry about the juice, okay?

716
00:57:49,502 --> 00:57:51,238
You have to focus.
- Melanie.

717
00:58:00,247 --> 00:58:01,479
- Feels like he's kicking.

718
00:58:01,481 --> 00:58:02,214
Tell her fetal movement

719
00:58:02,216 --> 00:58:03,048
is a good thing.

720
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:04,383
- It's a good thing.

721
00:58:04,385 --> 00:58:05,517
- It's uncomfortable.

722
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:08,053
- Water?

723
00:58:08,055 --> 00:58:09,724
Go rub her hips.

724
00:58:16,496 --> 00:58:17,495
- What are you doing?

725
00:58:17,497 --> 00:58:19,164
- Um-
- Say what you're doing.

726
00:58:19,166 --> 00:58:20,334
- I'm rubbing her hips.

727
00:58:21,335 --> 00:58:23,469
Your hips.
- Now tell her to take

728
00:58:23,471 --> 00:58:25,471
a slow breath.
- What?

729
00:58:25,473 --> 00:58:27,606
- Tell her to...

730
00:58:27,608 --> 00:58:29,842
- Something
is going on with your voice.

731
00:58:29,844 --> 00:58:30,909
- I gotta pee again.

732
00:58:30,911 --> 00:58:32,480
- Okay, let's go.

733
00:58:34,048 --> 00:58:36,815
- It's like I need
to go but I can't.

734
00:58:38,953 --> 00:58:40,419
- What?

735
00:58:40,421 --> 00:58:41,920
- I'm
saying that.

736
00:58:41,922 --> 00:58:43,455
- I can't
understand what you're saying.

737
00:58:43,457 --> 00:58:45,090
- I can't go anymore.

738
00:58:45,092 --> 00:58:46,792
I'm right here.

739
00:58:53,534 --> 00:58:55,267
- Could you light
some of that incense?

740
00:58:55,269 --> 00:58:56,170
- Yeah.

741
00:58:59,073 --> 00:59:00,005
- I
couldn't hear anything

742
00:59:00,007 --> 00:59:01,440
you were saying back there.

743
00:59:01,442 --> 00:59:02,941
Johnny, I can't really hear

744
00:59:02,943 --> 00:59:04,243
you anymore...

745
00:59:04,245 --> 00:59:06,211
- I
can't smell this stuff.

746
00:59:06,213 --> 00:59:08,147
- I don't,
I don't know what's going on.

747
00:59:08,149 --> 00:59:09,381
Johnny,

748
00:59:09,383 --> 00:59:10,616
- What?

749
00:59:13,821 --> 00:59:15,287
Melanie?

750
00:59:15,289 --> 00:59:17,189
- Melanie, can
you come help, please?

751
00:59:17,191 --> 00:59:18,025
- Uh huh.

752
00:59:20,961 --> 00:59:22,096
- Good, okay.

753
00:59:23,397 --> 00:59:25,664
- Open subconscious.
- Okay.

754
00:59:25,666 --> 00:59:27,499
- All right?
- Yeah.

755
00:59:27,501 --> 00:59:29,370
Melanie? Hello?

756
00:59:30,704 --> 00:59:32,071
- All right.
- Okay, got ya.

757
00:59:32,073 --> 00:59:33,072
- Okay, that's good.

758
00:59:33,074 --> 00:59:33,908
Come help.

759
00:59:35,876 --> 00:59:37,676
- Alright, okay.

760
00:59:37,678 --> 00:59:38,877
- You wanna just grab my leg?

761
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:41,146
Can you help?

762
00:59:41,148 --> 00:59:42,549
- Like this?

763
00:59:44,318 --> 00:59:45,984
- There you go.

764
00:59:45,986 --> 00:59:47,753
Okay.

765
00:59:47,755 --> 00:59:48,987
- Okay.
- Okay.

766
00:59:48,989 --> 00:59:50,157
Uh, could you grab
one of those towels?

767
00:59:51,292 --> 00:59:52,791
- Melanie?

768
00:59:52,793 --> 00:59:54,326
Please answer me.

769
00:59:54,328 --> 00:59:56,161
- Honey, can
you get me a mirror?

770
00:59:56,163 --> 00:59:57,129
- Yeah.

771
00:59:57,131 --> 00:59:57,798
- Here.
- Thanks.

772
01:00:04,772 --> 01:00:08,040
My arms, they keep shaking.

773
01:00:08,042 --> 01:00:08,876
See?

774
01:00:10,711 --> 01:00:12,244
- Uh huh.

775
01:00:12,246 --> 01:00:13,247
- Is that...?

776
01:00:14,615 --> 01:00:15,517
What do you think?

777
01:00:16,851 --> 01:00:17,685
- Um...

778
01:00:20,522 --> 01:00:21,655
It's totally normal.

779
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:23,891
- You sure?
- Yes.

780
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:29,562
- Oh my god, thank you.

781
01:00:29,564 --> 01:00:31,031
- Here you go.
- Oh, yeah.

782
01:00:32,967 --> 01:00:34,066
Okay.

783
01:00:41,543 --> 01:00:44,478
- Hey, maybe you could
put on some relaxing music?

784
01:00:47,047 --> 01:00:47,848
Melanie?

785
01:00:48,983 --> 01:00:50,182
- Yes.

786
01:00:50,184 --> 01:00:52,451
Yeah, um, music.

787
01:00:52,453 --> 01:00:53,819
- How about
that one playlist?

788
01:00:53,821 --> 01:00:55,954
- Playlist, yes.

789
01:00:55,956 --> 01:00:57,590
Playlist.

790
01:00:57,592 --> 01:00:58,957
How do I-
- The one that you

791
01:00:58,959 --> 01:01:00,159
showed us on your phone.

792
01:01:00,161 --> 01:01:03,797
- Phone. Oh, yeah.

793
01:01:04,832 --> 01:01:06,198
Um...

794
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,169
Oh, sorry.

795
01:01:12,039 --> 01:01:14,875
Oh, that's a podcast.

796
01:01:17,778 --> 01:01:19,612
This is a good song.

797
01:01:19,614 --> 01:01:21,614
- You know, don't
worry about it.

798
01:01:21,616 --> 01:01:22,981
- Okay.

799
01:01:24,251 --> 01:01:25,450
- Something's wrong.
- What do you mean?

800
01:01:25,452 --> 01:01:28,954
- The pain
is like really sharp.

801
01:01:28,956 --> 01:01:30,189
Shouldn't Ruby be here?

802
01:01:30,191 --> 01:01:31,990
- You said she
was on her way, right?

803
01:01:31,992 --> 01:01:34,295
- Um-
- Is that the smoke alarm?

804
01:01:40,935 --> 01:01:44,102
- Should I get that?
- Uh-huh

805
01:01:44,104 --> 01:01:49,109
- Okay.

806
01:01:51,312 --> 01:01:54,379
- Hey, Melanie, I'm
so sorry I'm late.

807
01:01:54,381 --> 01:01:55,548
Is she pushing yet?

808
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:57,349
- Ruby, is that you?

809
01:01:57,351 --> 01:01:59,251
- I think so.
- Yeah?

810
01:01:59,253 --> 01:02:01,386
Hey, I'll be right there!

811
01:02:01,388 --> 01:02:02,489
And how are you doing?

812
01:02:03,658 --> 01:02:04,823
- Good.

813
01:02:04,825 --> 01:02:06,491
- Good.

814
01:02:07,328 --> 01:02:08,160
Hi, guys.

815
01:02:08,162 --> 01:02:09,629
I'm so sorry I'm late.

816
01:02:09,631 --> 01:02:10,862
How are we doing?

817
01:02:17,539 --> 01:02:18,370
- Hello?

818
01:02:18,372 --> 01:02:19,505
- Hey, Melanie.

819
01:02:19,507 --> 01:02:21,039
- Mom!

820
01:02:21,041 --> 01:02:21,974
- Hi.

821
01:02:21,976 --> 01:02:23,710
- How's it going?

822
01:02:23,712 --> 01:02:26,713
- Uh huh, good, good.

823
01:02:26,715 --> 01:02:28,347
- What was that?

824
01:02:28,349 --> 01:02:29,416
- Um, the TV.

825
01:02:31,085 --> 01:02:33,018
- Oh okay.

826
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:34,419
So, I'm just calling
to let you know

827
01:02:34,421 --> 01:02:35,289
that I'm on my way home.

828
01:02:38,693 --> 01:02:40,092
- What?

829
01:02:40,094 --> 01:02:41,093
- Yeah, I'm
driving now so I can't talk.

830
01:02:41,095 --> 01:02:43,495
But I'll see you
and Johnny soon.

831
01:02:43,497 --> 01:02:46,465
- Okay.

832
01:03:05,986 --> 01:03:07,388
- Melanie?

833
01:03:09,557 --> 01:03:12,824
I'll be right there,
you're doing great.

834
01:03:12,826 --> 01:03:13,792
There you go.

835
01:03:13,794 --> 01:03:14,629
- Hi, hi.

836
01:03:15,764 --> 01:03:17,362
Do you think this is
gonna take a long time?

837
01:03:17,364 --> 01:03:19,766
- Why? Do you have somewhere
else you need to be?

838
01:03:19,768 --> 01:03:22,334
- No, no, I, I...

839
01:03:22,336 --> 01:03:25,070
I just wanna know if
it's gonna take awhile.

840
01:03:25,072 --> 01:03:26,405
- Well, you know how this goes.

841
01:03:26,407 --> 01:03:27,973
He's gonna come when he's ready.

842
01:03:27,975 --> 01:03:29,408
- Okay.
- I'm gonna check, okay?

843
01:03:29,410 --> 01:03:30,578
Okay.

844
01:03:31,445 --> 01:03:32,978
Here's my touch.

845
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:35,414
There's my hand nice and slow.

846
01:03:35,416 --> 01:03:36,582
You're doing great.

847
01:03:36,584 --> 01:03:37,750
- Melanie?

848
01:03:37,752 --> 01:03:38,950
- Nine and a half,

849
01:03:38,952 --> 01:03:41,320
you're almost there.
- Is that...

850
01:03:41,322 --> 01:03:44,557
I need you.

851
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:47,292
Okay, you're getting close.

852
01:03:52,266 --> 01:03:53,100
Melanie?

853
01:03:56,904 --> 01:03:59,037
Can you hear me?

854
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:00,939
Johnny!
- Melanie.

855
01:04:00,941 --> 01:04:02,809
- Melanie.

856
01:04:02,811 --> 01:04:03,810
- Yeah?

857
01:04:03,812 --> 01:04:05,277
- Can you
grab the mirror?

858
01:04:05,279 --> 01:04:06,546
- Yeah,
it's over there.

859
01:04:06,548 --> 01:04:08,046
- I want you
to see this, Priya.

860
01:04:08,048 --> 01:04:09,649
The head is starting to crown.

861
01:04:09,651 --> 01:04:12,819
- Oh, my god!

862
01:04:14,455 --> 01:04:16,888
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, it's all good.

863
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:18,223
There's a dust pan

864
01:04:18,225 --> 01:04:19,391
in the closet.
- Everyone's wearing shoes?

865
01:04:19,393 --> 01:04:20,859
- I can't do this!
- Yes, you can, Priya.

866
01:04:20,861 --> 01:04:21,794
Yes, you can.
- You're gonna push again.

867
01:04:21,796 --> 01:04:23,061
- No, I can't, I really can't.

868
01:04:23,063 --> 01:04:24,996
- You can do this.
- Yes, you can.

869
01:04:33,207 --> 01:04:35,040
- I'm scared.

870
01:04:35,042 --> 01:04:37,744
I'm right here with you.

871
01:04:43,651 --> 01:04:45,718
- Melanie, you're
going to hold this knee, okay?

872
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,386
- Okay.
- On the next one you are going

873
01:04:47,388 --> 01:04:48,755
to lean forward.

874
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:56,865
We've got the head.

875
01:05:03,772 --> 01:05:04,873
Almost there.

876
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:11,245
Good, good.

877
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:21,054
Melanie?

878
01:05:27,762 --> 01:05:30,095
- Johnny?

879
01:06:21,516 --> 01:06:24,182
- Hi, this
is Johnny's phone.

880
01:06:24,184 --> 01:06:26,754
- At the tone,
please record your message.

881
01:06:27,922 --> 01:06:31,693
- Um, hi, Johnny.

882
01:06:33,227 --> 01:06:34,829
It's Melanie.

883
01:06:36,196 --> 01:06:39,064
I guess I don't really
know what to say.

884
01:06:39,066 --> 01:06:44,071
Um, I woke up, or whatever
here at Priya's house

885
01:06:46,508 --> 01:06:51,478
and she's okay and the baby
is healthy and I'm, I'm fine.

886
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:58,751
Yeah, I, I guess I just
wanted to make sure

887
01:06:58,753 --> 01:07:00,153
that you're okay.

888
01:07:01,021 --> 01:07:02,322
So, let me know.

889
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:27,815
- Hello?

890
01:07:29,283 --> 01:07:30,117
Johnny?

891
01:07:34,454 --> 01:07:35,590
Are you guys here?

892
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,960
What do I need?

893
01:07:40,962 --> 01:07:43,763
Hey, there you are.

894
01:07:43,765 --> 01:07:45,565
You look all worn out.

895
01:07:45,567 --> 01:07:47,132
How are you feeling?

896
01:07:47,134 --> 01:07:48,466
- Fine.

897
01:07:48,468 --> 01:07:49,303
- Yeah?

898
01:07:50,270 --> 01:07:51,671
Where's Melanie?

899
01:07:51,673 --> 01:07:53,606
- Oh, she left.

900
01:07:53,608 --> 01:07:55,173
- Did she leave you alone?

901
01:07:55,175 --> 01:08:00,180
- No, she uh, left when
she saw you drive in.

902
01:08:00,414 --> 01:08:01,248
- Oh.

903
01:08:01,916 --> 01:08:02,850
That's too bad.

904
01:08:04,686 --> 01:08:05,920
I wanted to say goodbye.

905
01:08:11,826 --> 01:08:13,561
Did you and Melanie
go outside today?

906
01:08:17,732 --> 01:08:18,566
Johnny?

907
01:08:25,039 --> 01:08:26,706
You're not hungry?

908
01:08:31,345 --> 01:08:32,179
Who is that?

909
01:08:36,584 --> 01:08:38,084
Hi, Melanie!
- Hi.

910
01:08:38,086 --> 01:08:39,585
- Oh, I'm so glad.

911
01:08:39,587 --> 01:08:41,587
I thought I wasn't gonna
get to say goodbye to you.

912
01:08:41,589 --> 01:08:45,357
- Yeah, I thought
so too, but I'm glad

913
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:46,892
we get to say goodbye now.

914
01:08:46,894 --> 01:08:48,561
- Would you
like to stay for dinner?

915
01:08:48,563 --> 01:08:50,362
- Oh no,
that's okay, I can't.

916
01:08:50,364 --> 01:08:55,268
I um, I have some stuff
that I forgot here and I...

917
01:08:56,303 --> 01:08:57,570
Hi.

918
01:08:57,572 --> 01:08:58,940
- Do you know where
Melanie's stuff is?

919
01:09:02,409 --> 01:09:03,243
- Yeah.

920
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:17,959
- I guess these are my things.
- Mm-hm.

921
01:09:21,328 --> 01:09:23,129
- What's that?

922
01:09:23,131 --> 01:09:24,632
- Found this stuff in my room.

923
01:09:26,199 --> 01:09:27,434
I think it's your mom's.

924
01:09:28,502 --> 01:09:29,969
- Oh.

925
01:09:29,971 --> 01:09:34,509
- So, we can
talk about it if you want.

926
01:09:38,278 --> 01:09:40,280
- I think this is yours.

927
01:09:43,216 --> 01:09:44,652
- Oh yeah, I was
looking for that.

928
01:09:51,025 --> 01:09:52,359
You can keep it.

929
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:55,094
- Really?

930
01:09:55,096 --> 01:09:56,196
- Yeah, sure.

931
01:10:11,512 --> 01:10:12,345
Bye.

932
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:15,074
Being in you made me feel

933
01:11:15,076 --> 01:11:16,778
like I could do anything.

934
01:11:18,378 --> 01:11:21,582
Outside there are
things that feel bad,

935
01:11:22,917 --> 01:11:25,918
but there are also
things that feel good.

936
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:30,091
And if you just stay home you
don't get to feel any of it.

937
01:11:39,867 --> 01:11:43,536
- All right, mister.

938
01:11:43,538 --> 01:11:44,371
- Come in.

939
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:46,974
- We better hit the road.

940
01:11:49,844 --> 01:11:50,645
- I'm ready.

941
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:54,816
- Did Melanie give you that?

942
01:11:56,383 --> 01:11:57,185
- Yes.

943
01:12:01,022 --> 01:12:02,089
- It looks nice on you.

944
01:12:05,993 --> 01:12:06,761
- I know.
