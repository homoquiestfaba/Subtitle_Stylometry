1
00:01:06,834 --> 00:01:09,268
We're following a series of
shootings in Columbus.

2
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,404
The daytime gun battle on a busy
street caught on camera.

3
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,173
<i>Get out of the car!</i>

4
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:21,280
Shocking new video tonight that
you'll only see here.

5
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:23,415
<i> Put your hands down!</i>

6
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:24,583
<i> Get off the bike.</i>

7
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:26,418
<i> Get off the bike.</i>

8
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,686
<i> Put your hands up!</i>

9
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:35,995
There's a new effort today

10
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:38,464
to try to stop all the gang
related violence in our city.

11
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:41,100
Police have made some arrests

12
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,502
after the killing of yet another
teenager on a Columbus street.

13
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:46,138
Summer police are dealing with
an unsettling spike

14
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,372
in violent crime.

15
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,249
Spokesperson for governor
meserve says that

16
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:59,852
these shootings are not
random acts of violence.

17
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:02,254
Quote: "What I want to let
everyone at home know

18
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:04,690
is that these are targeted acts
of criminals..."

19
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:06,859
I'm sorry.
I'm getting some breaking news.

20
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:08,310
Word that a protest...

21
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:09,760
We're hearing that a protest we
were covering

22
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:12,498
has escalated into violence.
We're gonna go live now to...

23
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,135
The police have identified
three shooting victims

24
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,871
found behind the sheetrock
of an apartment building

25
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:20,305
that's undergoing a remodel.

26
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,375
Tragically, we can now confirm
that one of the victims

27
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:26,444
was an undercover police officer
killed in the line of duty.

28
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,480
Hundreds attended the solemn
funeral procession

29
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,749
of slain officer Hernandez
earlier today.

30
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:32,718
In his eulogy,

31
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,686
governor meserve continues to
stress that crime is down.

32
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:37,422
In fact, quote:
"Hype and hysteria are up."

33
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,726
This summer has seen a 24%
increase in shootings

34
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:42,294
over the last year.

35
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:45,497
We are just receiving some
alarming news right now.

36
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,933
A shootout is actually erupting.
That's happening...

37
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:49,468
Where's this happening?

38
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:57,176
Right now, we're receiving word
of a police chase

39
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:59,878
that's going on on
interstate 75.

40
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,613
He actually might spin out here.

41
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:04,349
There are officers, you guys,
right behind him.

42
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:06,718
All right, it looks like we're
coming to a stop out here.

43
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,320
The guy is getting out
of the vehicle.

44
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,522
The guy is getting out of the
vehicle. He's got a gun.

45
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:11,490
He's got a gun.

46
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:13,209
He just got into a Van.

47
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,927
This could end very badly out
here. He's gesturing.

48
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:16,829
Oh, this is not good.

49
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,730
This is now a hostage situation.
The person trying to get out...

50
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,532
Oh no, he's being dragged.

51
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:21,733
A guy is being dragged.

52
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,368
This has now turned into
a hostage situation.

53
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:26,605
Violent crime has increased 18%
this year

54
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:28,607
with a significant spike
in shootings.

55
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:30,475
Over 300 shootings this year

56
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,811
with close to 50
gun related deaths.

57
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,581
Local police say that an
abundance of illegal guns

58
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,716
in the hands of gang members
are the cause.

59
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,685
Well, John, the sheriff
has yet to release

60
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:41,570
an official statement.

61
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:43,454
But an inside source has told me
that this horrific shooting

62
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:46,391
is very likely another
gang initiation.

63
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,260
Governor meserve returned to
Columbus today

64
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:50,696
for a campaign rally where he
continued to stress

65
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:53,532
that crime is in fact down
across the state.

66
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:56,301
I am just being told right now
that the third shooting victim

67
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:59,671
has been pronounced dead upon
arrival at county hospital.

68
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:02,541
Police have released security
cam footage of the suspect.

69
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:03,976
A warning to our viewers...

70
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:06,478
These images may be difficult
for some.

71
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,525
In less than four years,

72
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:24,396
we've cut this state's homicide
rate nearly in half.

73
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,665
Robbery rate, a third.

74
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:32,271
Vandalism, auto theft,
crime is down.

75
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,879
But don't ask me.

76
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:42,648
Mom!

77
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,084
Look. It's your new boss.

78
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:47,519
Have we pushed drugs and gangs
out of our neighborhoods?

79
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:55,827
Together, we've called out the
corrupt.

80
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:59,865
And together, we'll keep going
into the future.

81
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:05,437
<i> What about the pipeline?</i>

82
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:11,777
Well as I've always maintained,
the corner turn oil line

83
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,945
would be a boon
to this state's economy.

84
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:16,315
Clean water is a human right.

85
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:18,050
That's why my office

86
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:21,320
has commissioned its own
environmental review

87
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:23,322
<i>to compare</i>
<i>with the e.P.A.'S audit.</i>

88
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,623
Mom.

89
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,091
Mom! Look, you're famous!

90
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:28,026
They're talking about your
project.

91
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:30,829
I'm not famous. I'm just
checking the numbers

92
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,465
for the secretary
of somebody famous.

93
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:35,967
Cuz apparently famous people
cannot do their own math.

94
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,536
Thank you.

95
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:39,971
Hey.

96
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:40,372
Hey, hey, hey.

97
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:02,594
Look at you.
What, did you lie out?

98
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:04,646
A little.

99
00:06:04,647 --> 00:06:06,697
Damn. I should go away
more often. Hi.

100
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,470
I missed you, Stan.

101
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:16,608
So, how did it work out
with your boss?

102
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:18,710
Not so good.

103
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,612
Well, what do you mean?

104
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:22,814
I want to hear about you first.

105
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:24,750
Tell me everything.
How did it go?

106
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:27,619
Okay.
I'm just saying it was awesome.

107
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:30,422
Those headquarters,
it's the real deal.

108
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:32,457
I loved it.

109
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,558
Oh my god, baby.

110
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:38,764
Well, so...

111
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,932
So he said I'll call you.

112
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:44,603
And I said, "what the hell does
that mean, we'll call you?'

113
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:48,740
and he said, "Stan,
I'll see you soon. Real soon."

114
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,144
So does that mean
you got the job?

115
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:53,145
I don't know. Maybe.

116
00:06:53,147 --> 00:06:55,480
Oh, that would be so amazing.

117
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:58,049
I know. California, baby.

118
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:01,186
Abbie and Mike could come visit.
Bring Jimmy to Disneyland.

119
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:03,188
I know. It would be so cool.
It'd be awesome.

120
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,790
Where'd you park?
Wait, where did I...

121
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,625
I thought I parked...
It's 3g.

122
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:09,528
Yeah.
Ah-hah.

123
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,129
There you go.

124
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,566
Ah, shit.

125
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:16,602
Man.

126
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,203
Oh my god.
How'd that happen?

127
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:19,538
Should I call triple a?

128
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,539
No. I'll do it.

129
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:21,773
You sure?

130
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:22,474
Yeah.

131
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,543
<i>Excuse me, ma'am?</i>

132
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:25,477
<i>Excuse me?</i>

133
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:27,913
I'm late for my flight. I've got
my kid waiting in the lobby.

134
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:30,182
I just need three more bucks
for my ticket.

135
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:31,650
Not today.

136
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:33,885
Come on, man.
She's about to give it to me.

137
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:35,687
Get in the car.

138
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,022
Not today.

139
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:37,923
For real?

140
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:38,790
For real.

141
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:39,524
Seriously?

142
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:40,592
Seriously. Just,

143
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:43,161
just back off. Okay?

144
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,165
Stan!

145
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:04,749
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

146
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:05,817
Come on!

147
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:15,954
Mr. hill,

148
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:20,225
I'm detective gilmore.
Columbus Metro p.D.

149
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:22,761
How's that cut?

150
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,195
Huh?

151
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,164
Cut on your forehead.

152
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:32,103
Forehead bleeds a lot.
It gets in your eyes and...

153
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:36,041
But you still got a good look
at the suspect?

154
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:38,910
Yes. I saw him before he hit me.

155
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,346
But there was more than one.
There...

156
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:42,981
How many?

157
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:48,587
Well I just, just heard them.
But were like two or three.

158
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:51,856
Did you get a look at the
vehicle?

159
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,327
No, I just heard that too.
I just kinda...

160
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:58,730
It sounded like the rumble of a
hemi engine,

161
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:01,900
you know maybe a 60's muscle car
or something like that.

162
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:06,271
I used to rebuild engines
since I was a kid.

163
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:09,307
And I'm a plant manager for
Chrysler. Well, I was.

164
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:12,811
Now Honda, maybe.

165
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,647
Where's that sketch artist?

166
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,349
I'll get him.

167
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:20,986
Mr. hill, this is my partner,
detective Walker.

168
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:24,322
He's gonna ask you
a few more questions.

169
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:28,727
Sir.

170
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:32,063
I can't even imagine what you
must be going through.

171
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:34,899
But you know every little detail
is gonna get us closer

172
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,868
to the people that did this.

173
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,836
And it's best to do this when
the memory's fresh.

174
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:39,771
Sorry.

175
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:43,241
I make this speech
way too often.

176
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,979
Mr. hill, what was the state of
your marriage?

177
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,214
Were you getting along?

178
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:51,116
What the hell kind of question
is that?

179
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:53,084
It's just a standard one, sir.

180
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:57,188
Are you married, detective?

181
00:10:58,325 --> 00:10:59,691
Was.

182
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:01,359
Didn't work out.

183
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:07,666
Well then you don't know.
You just don't know.

184
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,885
I don't know what
I'm gonna do without you.

185
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:29,688
I'm gonna miss you
so much.

186
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,393
I love you.

187
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:40,432
Dad.

188
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:43,435
Hi, baby.

189
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:53,411
You know...

190
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:59,017
The day you were coming home,
she was driving me nuts.

191
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,052
Oh yeah, why?

192
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,421
She had to get
a whole new outfit.

193
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:04,889
She wanted...

194
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,992
She wanted tan lines

195
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:11,029
cuz she thought they were sexy.

196
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:17,969
People are starting to arrive.

197
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:20,004
I'm gonna leave.

198
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:23,275
Dad.

199
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,809
I can't... I can't see people.

200
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,010
But everyone's gonna ask.

201
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:29,280
I know. But I only came for her.
I love you.

202
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:30,648
Okay.
I'll see you later.

203
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,015
Do you want Mike
to drive you home?
Mr. hill?

204
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:32,984
No, no, no. I'm good.

205
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:33,918
Mr. hill?

206
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:35,353
Yes?

207
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:36,821
Are the arrangements
satisfactory?

208
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,523
They're fine.

209
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:41,159
Then shall we join your friends

210
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:44,529
to say goodbye to Vivian
together?

211
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,397
She's already gone.

212
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:49,134
Take this.

213
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:54,806
I don't pray.

214
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,810
I only went to church
for my wife.

215
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:01,813
That's why I'm giving it to you.

216
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,613
Governor meserve,

217
00:13:18,614 --> 00:13:20,397
you've stood by your record
for reducing crime in Ohio.

218
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,967
Do you have any comments about
the murder of Vivian hill?

219
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,335
Well first,

220
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:27,105
our thoughts and prayers go out
to the hill family.

221
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:29,007
And secondly,

222
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:32,377
this tragedy in our state
capitol should remind us

223
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,479
that we need to stay vigilant.

224
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,549
Our fight against crime doesn't
end just because we're winning.

225
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:40,318
<i>My office is in constant contact</i>

226
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:43,188
with mayor Roberts
and police commissioner brown.

227
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,457
And we promise swift justice for
Vivian hill and for her family.

228
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:48,860
<i> Thank you.</i>

229
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,224
Hello?

230
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,560
Dad. It's me.
I'm just checking in.

231
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,161
<i> You okay?</i>

232
00:14:57,163 --> 00:15:00,899
Hi, honey.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

233
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,068
<i> You sure?</i>

234
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,236
Yeah. Yeah,
hey, you get some rest.

235
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,338
Okay. You too.

236
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:11,242
<i> Dad, just promise me you won't</i>
<i> blame yourself for all this.</i>

237
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,978
<i>Honey,</i>
<i>you just try to get some sleep.</i>

238
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,280
Good night.

239
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:16,114
I love you.

240
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,583
I love you too.

241
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:25,690
<i>Thanks for coming in, Mr. hill.</i>

242
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:26,624
<i> So what's happening?</i>

243
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,960
<i>Well, we may have gotten lucky.</i>

244
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:31,562
They picked him up at a traffic
stop last night,

245
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:33,431
tweaked out of his mind.

246
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,499
Good ears, Mr. hill.

247
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:36,134
What do you mean?

248
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:38,436
He was driving a '67 charger.

249
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,470
Really?

250
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:41,706
A charger?

251
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:45,343
You ready?

252
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:49,280
It's okay.
The detector's broken.

253
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,716
No. I haven't smoked in years.

254
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,585
You wife hound you too?

255
00:15:57,724 --> 00:15:59,841
Send them in!

256
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:01,959
You said he had a tattoo
on his face. Right, Mr. hill?

257
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:06,531
Gentlemen, face right.

258
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:12,303
Number four, step forward.

259
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,246
No, that's... that's a teardrop.
That's not him.

260
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:23,214
Take your time.

261
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:24,148
I will.

262
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,718
Eyes up, guys. Let's see
your faces, both sides.

263
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,719
Face left.

264
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:31,556
Face front.

265
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:33,424
Hold.

266
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:38,696
Two. The second guy.

267
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,465
Number two, up front.

268
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:44,268
Number two, remove your hat.

269
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:50,508
That's him.

270
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:53,027
That's him.

271
00:16:53,028 --> 00:16:54,611
You sure, Mr. hill? Now you said
he was wearing a hoodie.

272
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:56,514
You had blood in your eyes.
Did you see his face?

273
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,817
No, I didn't... I didn't
have blood. I wasn't hit yet.

274
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:01,119
That, that's him.
You told us in your statement it
was a tattoo of a bat.

275
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:03,087
You seemed pretty sure.

276
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,356
This is a homicide case.
We can't go on a guess.

277
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,259
No, I thought it was a bat.
But it's a fly. And that's him.

278
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,728
I'm certain of it.
That's him.

279
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:13,064
Okay.

280
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:15,666
Okay what?

281
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:17,368
Okay, uh...

282
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:18,669
That's it?

283
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:20,471
That's it.

284
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:22,173
Thank you.

285
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:30,048
Thank you.

286
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:50,802
Appreciate it.

287
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:25,103
What happened?

288
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,404
Why did you let him go?

289
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:27,738
Keep your voice down.

290
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,507
No, no, no.
You keep your voice down!

291
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:30,875
Don't make it worse, Mr. hill.
Worse?! Worse?!

292
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:33,611
What could be worse than
the man who killed my wife

293
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,114
walks out of here like it's a
joke! Like it's nothing!

294
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:38,382
Even if we bring him back,
it's not gonna help your case.

295
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:41,686
Okay. How will I help my case?
Tell me.

296
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:42,487
Time.

297
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:43,654
Time?

298
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,256
These types don't live long.

299
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,857
He'll od.
He'll get himself killed.

300
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,558
Oh Jesus Christ.

301
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,628
You want me to go home and hope
that he dies. Is that it?

302
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,362
Ah, Jesus.

303
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,131
Mr. hill.

304
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,899
I'd like to hang most of the
shit bags who walk through here.

305
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:58,603
But I can't.
Neither can you.

306
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:03,374
Know what?

307
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:06,410
You're right.
It's not my job.

308
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:08,679
It's your job. It is.

309
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,381
It's okay.

310
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:19,757
The kid's on lemi k's crew.
That whole file's on ice.

311
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,326
Yeah, well
it better stay that way.

312
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:23,361
Yeah.

313
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:34,672
Dad?

314
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:38,209
Dad, I've been trying to call
you. What happened? Was it him?

315
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:40,478
Yeah, it's him.
I'm sure of it.

316
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,712
So they arrested him?

317
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:44,582
No, no. They told me
i wasn't a credible witness.

318
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,418
They let that piece of shit
walk?!

319
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,520
The police don't care
about your mother.

320
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,322
It's just another body to them.

321
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:52,423
That's bullshit.

322
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:54,258
I know, I know.

323
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:58,729
Hey. Do you want to
come over tonight?

324
00:19:58,731 --> 00:19:59,897
You could spend the night
with us.

325
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:01,666
We can talk about it.

326
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:05,636
No thanks, honey. I'm good.
I just, I just really,

327
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:08,673
I just need to be alone.

328
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:45,343
<i> Hi. You've reached the hills.</i>
<i> We're not in right now.</i>

329
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:48,846
<i> After the beep, please leave a</i>
<i> message for Stanley or Vivian.</i>

330
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:16,607
<i> You made a big change for me.</i>
<i> A long time ago.</i>

331
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:48,399
I heard about Vivian.

332
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:50,401
I'm sorry.

333
00:22:50,403 --> 00:22:53,037
Yeah.
We buried her last week.

334
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:55,773
You know we never did funerals.

335
00:22:55,775 --> 00:22:57,975
That's not why I'm calling.

336
00:22:58,644 --> 00:23:00,010
All right.

337
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:02,747
So what do you need?

338
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:05,049
Just a few names.

339
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:26,137
Hello?

340
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:05,543
There's no smoking in the shop.

341
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,745
They're your cigarettes,
asshole.

342
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:11,015
There's definitely no stealing
in the shop either.

343
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:16,687
Been a while since you came in.

344
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:18,889
Yeah, well there's

345
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:21,859
a lot of things I haven't done
for a while.

346
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:22,993
Had a grandson.

347
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:24,128
Good for you.

348
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,096
Buy him a puppy.

349
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,733
That Sao Paulo op.
When was that?

350
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,470
Twenty years ago?

351
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:37,041
Really haven't thought about it.
Couldn't tell you.

352
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,210
You mad at me?

353
00:24:39,846 --> 00:24:41,996
You're mad at me.

354
00:24:41,997 --> 00:24:44,147
Do I look like a guy who's hung
out to dry and is mad?

355
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,584
No, I don't think so.

356
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:54,959
Stanley. Trust.

357
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:56,193
I do.

358
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:59,230
No. You really don't.
You still have issues.

359
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:06,003
If you had just trusted me
this much...

360
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,873
We'd still be out in the field.

361
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,808
You know that's not why I left.

362
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,042
I know. I know.

363
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:15,746
Vivian. A woman like that
was worth walking away for.

364
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:19,583
You hit the lottery
when you found her.

365
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:23,287
After San Paulo, what happened,

366
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:25,689
I just couldn't put her
through it anymore.

367
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:26,957
Yeah, yeah.

368
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:28,224
No, I told you it was true then
and it was.

369
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:30,511
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

370
00:25:30,512 --> 00:25:32,796
Dennis, don't...Don't question
my trust, please.

371
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:35,766
Okay.
You want to talk about trust?

372
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:37,768
Then you trust me
when I tell you to give it up.

373
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:38,769
What?

374
00:25:38,938 --> 00:25:40,237
This mission of yours.

375
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:45,643
They killed her for nothing.
Nothing, man!

376
00:25:45,645 --> 00:25:47,912
Look at me. I get it.
You're hurting.

377
00:25:47,914 --> 00:25:49,613
I get it.
You want vengeance.

378
00:25:49,615 --> 00:25:51,415
I was justice.

379
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:53,216
You want vengeance, Stanley.
I know you.

380
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:57,688
No. I'm doing this. I have to.

381
00:25:58,257 --> 00:25:59,290
That's it.

382
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:12,303
Okay. You asked for names.
I got you names.

383
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:13,971
They're low-level dealers.

384
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:17,341
Cops haul them in ten times a
year. Nothing ever happens.

385
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:23,047
What about this guy?

386
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:24,281
I'm still working on him.

387
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:26,717
Look. This is my way of helping
you through your grieving.

388
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:29,353
I owe you that. But we don't
do this anymore, Stanley.

389
00:26:30,623 --> 00:26:32,756
I mean you want to dive back
into this...

390
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,292
I was pushed back into this.

391
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:37,827
What kept us alive back in the
day? It was just a job.

392
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,929
No emotion.

393
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:42,866
Nothing to put a pause in our
step or cloud our judgment.

394
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:44,034
This...

395
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:46,971
Stanley, this ain't good.

396
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:50,207
Do you really want to
go down that road?

397
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:55,679
They already know my name.
Now I know theirs.

398
00:26:56,015 --> 00:26:57,848
That's all I need.

399
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,217
Thank you, my man.

400
00:27:04,724 --> 00:27:06,290
Oh boy.

401
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:44,361
Whiskey straight.

402
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:52,169
What up, Nathan?

403
00:27:54,407 --> 00:27:58,008
Lemi says sell this a dime a bag
and nothing less.

404
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:02,279
Yeah. Got that fine shit.

405
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:04,281
It's what it is, man.

406
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,887
I dunno what shit
you got yourself into.

407
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:11,889
But there's a gringo
looking for you.

408
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:14,725
Well let him come looking.

409
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:16,726
He's gonna need
some cold damn steel.

410
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:20,898
Papi, you don't even have money
to put bullets in that gun.

411
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,770
Drinks on me, lady.

412
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:29,973
Where'd you get that?

413
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:33,143
I've been busy.

414
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:38,282
Actually, I got you a little
gift too. Some high-end shit.

415
00:28:48,027 --> 00:28:51,195
See that crack head at the end
of the bar? Who's that?

416
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:52,396
I dunno.

417
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:55,933
Why don't you go and find out
if you're so brave?

418
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,797
Don't shoot, man.
Don't shoot.

419
00:30:03,903 --> 00:30:05,269
You lookin' for me?

420
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:08,305
You must be lookin'
for Jesus too.

421
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,812
My wife had a light about her

422
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,415
that you and your scumbag
friends snuffed out.

423
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:19,550
For what?

424
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,051
A purse?

425
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:21,919
A few bucks?

426
00:30:21,921 --> 00:30:23,053
No, man.

427
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:25,189
It ain't nothin' like that.

428
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:26,490
That's not how it went down.

429
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:29,960
How did it go down?
You tell me.

430
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:31,495
And then we'll both know.

431
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:36,567
You really
have no damn idea, do you?

432
00:30:37,837 --> 00:30:39,603
Where's Charley lawes?

433
00:30:39,605 --> 00:30:42,840
That man with the fly tattoo
on his face. Where is he?

434
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,576
Up your ass.

435
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:52,015
What,
you're gonna kill me now?

436
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:54,017
Come on!

437
00:30:54,587 --> 00:30:58,188
It's the best shot.
It's the best shot.

438
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,259
Three minutes.

439
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,429
Your call.

440
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:12,569
What are you doing here?

441
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:13,470
Really?

442
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:15,405
You don't want backup
in a neighborhood like this?

443
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:17,040
What, are you kidding me?

444
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:20,210
Put that in there.

445
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,946
I'm supposed to thank you now
or something?

446
00:31:22,948 --> 00:31:24,882
Hey, thank me, don't thank me.
I don't care,

447
00:31:24,884 --> 00:31:26,383
you know, I'm telling ya...

448
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:30,187
You really got a bad attitude.
We need to talk.

449
00:31:58,183 --> 00:31:59,683
You're supposed to
count to three.

450
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:00,651
Is that right?

451
00:32:00,653 --> 00:32:03,587
Yeah. One, two, three.
Not one freakin' boom.

452
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,273
I've always said it takes a
certain kind of man

453
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:26,009
to wolf down food
after doing this type of work.

454
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:30,347
Why are you shadowing me?
I told you I got this.

455
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,017
Yeah.
So far you've just been lucky.

456
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:35,552
Yeah, well I got out alive.

457
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,689
And where was your secondary
escape route?

458
00:32:38,691 --> 00:32:40,074
Ugh, please.

459
00:32:40,075 --> 00:32:41,458
You engaged too long.
You were exposed.

460
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,194
What if the target had had
a better weapon

461
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:45,595
or training

462
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:47,431
or backup?

463
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:50,200
Look, Stan.

464
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:52,169
You can't afford to
screw this up.

465
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:53,470
Abbie's already
lost one parent.

466
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,605
That's on me.
Just me.

467
00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:58,008
I asked for intel. That's it.

468
00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,277
You're not tasked to do this.

469
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:03,180
Let me tell you something.

470
00:33:03,182 --> 00:33:06,350
The second I saw Vivian on the
news, I was tasked to this.

471
00:33:06,352 --> 00:33:09,753
Do you think I was surprised
when you contacted me?

472
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:11,521
No, I was waiting.

473
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:20,330
You were lucky tonight. Luck
will run out on you. I won't.

474
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:24,468
Yeah, all right.
What do we got here?

475
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,137
Let's see.

476
00:33:28,207 --> 00:33:30,173
Broken cell phone.

477
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:34,144
I'll take this back to the shop.
See what I can do.

478
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:36,013
What else we got?

479
00:33:36,015 --> 00:33:37,748
Oh wow.

480
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:41,051
Let me guess. Drugs.
You got drugs in there?

481
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:08,245
Well?

482
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:10,747
Two bastards just capped Nathan,
man.

483
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:12,382
Did they steal the crystal?

484
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:13,967
No, that's the thing.

485
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,551
They left the drugs.
They were looking for Charley.

486
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,054
Who are these assholes?

487
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:18,522
I don't know, man.
The whole shit was random.

488
00:34:18,524 --> 00:34:19,623
Nothing's random.

489
00:34:20,426 --> 00:34:21,625
Well, here.

490
00:34:22,094 --> 00:34:23,593
Check this out.

491
00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:29,332
You sat there taking pictures
while they capped my boy?

492
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:33,170
No, man. It wasn't like that.
There was two of them.

493
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:37,774
It's okay.

494
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:39,342
Afghan kush.

495
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:45,482
Now you know
this is gonna cost you, right?

496
00:34:45,484 --> 00:34:47,818
What do you need, man? Anything.

497
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,857
That ring.
I always liked that ring.

498
00:34:55,294 --> 00:34:56,159
Take it.

499
00:34:57,463 --> 00:35:00,330
I like the way it looks
on<i> your</i> finger.

500
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:01,231
Katya!

501
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:03,200
Come on, man! What is this?

502
00:35:07,306 --> 00:35:08,738
Please. Shit, man!

503
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:12,642
Oh come on, man! Please! Fuck!

504
00:35:20,586 --> 00:35:21,751
Call Charley fly.

505
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:23,687
Find these assholes.

506
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:26,456
Find their families.
Find their dogs.

507
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,258
And kill them all.

508
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:40,504
It's good to see you eating
again.

509
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:42,672
Yeah, well I feel a bit better.

510
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:45,709
You know I spoke to
an old buddy of mine,

511
00:35:45,711 --> 00:35:48,311
and he kinda put things
in perspective for me.

512
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:49,813
Who?

513
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:51,448
Well you wouldn't know him. He's
just an old friend.

514
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,550
But he, he said you know Stan,
these street guys...

515
00:35:53,552 --> 00:35:56,486
They're all
gonna end up dead soon enough.

516
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:59,556
And maybe you should just let
the police do their job.

517
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:01,458
Oh, one can only hope.

518
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,360
Hey.

519
00:36:04,563 --> 00:36:07,330
I'm gonna pack up
some of mom's stuff.

520
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:10,300
I thought it'd be a good idea
to get it out of the house.

521
00:36:10,302 --> 00:36:11,868
If that's okay with you.

522
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:12,936
Yeah.

523
00:36:12,938 --> 00:36:15,705
Okay. Well if Mike and i
can borrow the explorer,

524
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:17,340
we could come by tomorrow
before his shift.

525
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:20,844
Okay, well then I'll just leave
the keys on the hook.

526
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,179
Perfect.

527
00:36:24,716 --> 00:36:26,283
Oh, that's him.

528
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:29,452
I told him I'd see him today,
so...

529
00:36:29,454 --> 00:36:31,388
I should probably get going.

530
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:32,372
Okay.

531
00:36:32,373 --> 00:36:33,355
I'll get the check.

532
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:35,458
Miss?

533
00:36:36,461 --> 00:36:37,294
Hey, boys.

534
00:36:37,296 --> 00:36:38,328
<i> Hey, boss.</i>

535
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:41,198
We'll be downstairs
checking the pipes.

536
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,332
<i> Cool.</i>

537
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,465
Josh, you got a parking ticket.

538
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:44,901
Ah, shit.

539
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:49,573
We do pretty well
at the barber shop.

540
00:36:49,575 --> 00:36:52,309
We still run a little intel
on the side.

541
00:36:52,311 --> 00:36:54,344
Custom made weapons,
that kind of thing.

542
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:56,413
Just enough
to keep life interesting.

543
00:36:58,217 --> 00:36:59,382
Wow.

544
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:00,250
Nice set-up.

545
00:37:00,252 --> 00:37:01,918
Yeah.

546
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,487
Now, I know you really love
your beretta and crank gun,

547
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:06,456
but you need options.

548
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:08,725
Right tool for the job.
Come here.

549
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:10,527
And if you find some asshole

550
00:37:10,529 --> 00:37:12,896
who wants to get up close
and personal with you,...

551
00:37:13,265 --> 00:37:14,731
Voilà.

552
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:17,000
Impressive. Damn.

553
00:37:17,002 --> 00:37:18,435
Self-protection.

554
00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:19,869
Latest and greatest
in body armor.

555
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:23,006
Check that out. It's like
putting silk on your ass.

556
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:25,475
Any luck with that cell phone?

557
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:28,945
Ah, it's gonna take
a little bit of time.

558
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:33,416
I got to run it on a program
from like 1994.

559
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,386
Hey.

560
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,564
No one likes a show off.

561
00:37:47,566 --> 00:37:49,032
All right, hot shot.

562
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:50,400
Try the 45.

563
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:54,571
So, let's say you manage
to ice these two pricks

564
00:37:54,573 --> 00:37:57,307
without getting yourself killed.
Then what?

565
00:37:57,309 --> 00:37:59,643
Do you think you can go back to
your old life?

566
00:37:59,645 --> 00:38:02,345
You're kicking a hornet's nest
here, pal.

567
00:38:02,347 --> 00:38:05,448
I mean who knows how many of
them are gonna crawl out of
there.

568
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:08,485
The way I see it, you either got
to kill them all or run.

569
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:09,319
I'm not running.

570
00:38:09,321 --> 00:38:11,588
I know a guy who does papers.

571
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,456
What are you suggesting?

572
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,859
Some place a little more
Equatorial.

573
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:18,295
Nah, I'll worry about it
at the time.

574
00:38:18,297 --> 00:38:20,930
Stan, you may not have that
luxury. I'm just saying...

575
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:24,668
If you have like life insurance
for Abbie to collect on.

576
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,403
You know me.

577
00:38:26,405 --> 00:38:28,338
You disappear...
I'll make damn sure

578
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,907
they find your car
with a burned body in it.

579
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:33,076
I'm good, man.
Good. It's all good.

580
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,313
I think we got something.

581
00:38:41,053 --> 00:38:42,619
What do you got?

582
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:45,555
A broken burner
with only one number on it.

583
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:46,756
Let's try it.

584
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:48,992
This number could be
Lars or Charley fly.

585
00:38:53,332 --> 00:38:54,431
Put it on speaker.

586
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:55,365
Uh huh.

587
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,973
<i> Zombie tattoo. Hello?</i>

588
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:05,475
Is Lars there?

589
00:39:05,477 --> 00:39:06,710
<i> No, not now.</i>

590
00:39:06,712 --> 00:39:08,645
Oh. When will he be back?

591
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:10,613
<i> Not sure.</i>

592
00:39:10,615 --> 00:39:12,015
<i>He's freelance, so it's hard...</i>

593
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:13,683
How 'bout Charley?

594
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:14,918
<i> Who is this?</i>

595
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:21,858
I always wanted a tattoo.

596
00:39:33,472 --> 00:39:36,840
No more arrests
for the rest of the night.

597
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:43,513
What's shakin'?

598
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:46,950
Lemi k wants to see you.

599
00:39:46,952 --> 00:39:47,684
Now.

600
00:40:08,707 --> 00:40:12,041
You are supposed to be
protecting me and my people.

601
00:40:12,177 --> 00:40:14,444
Do you need a little reminder?

602
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:18,715
<i>Help her! Somebody help her!</i>
<i> Hey, man! What'd you give her?</i>

603
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:21,017
That's the governor's kid.

604
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:26,890
He looks good, doesn't he?

605
00:40:27,726 --> 00:40:28,858
Remember.

606
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,161
Anything happens to me
or my boys,

607
00:40:31,163 --> 00:40:32,829
you know that's going online.

608
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:33,863
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

609
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:37,200
We kept Charley's ass out of
jail even after a positive ID.

610
00:40:37,202 --> 00:40:38,568
What's your problem?

611
00:40:39,538 --> 00:40:40,870
What's my problem?

612
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,207
My problem is I got guys
clockin' my operation.

613
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:47,977
Someone chases my boy Nate
out of the tick tock

614
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:50,330
and puts one in his face!

615
00:40:50,331 --> 00:40:52,682
Hey! Your boy Nate gets capped,
that's not our business.

616
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:56,519
Yes, it is.
That's my merchandise.

617
00:40:57,489 --> 00:41:00,023
You're detectives.
So go fuckin' detect.

618
00:41:00,025 --> 00:41:02,926
Find the guys who did this or
i send the governor a message.

619
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,239
I'm on my way.

620
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:18,942
<i>Got to meet you there. The alarm</i>
<i>just tripped at the shop.</i>

621
00:41:18,944 --> 00:41:19,976
Okay.

622
00:41:24,883 --> 00:41:26,649
At this point in the speech,

623
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:29,719
I'm gonna talk about how the
pipeline's gotten a clean report

624
00:41:29,721 --> 00:41:32,655
from the epa and my
independent consultants.

625
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,524
So the project's a go.

626
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:35,725
<i> Okay.</i>

627
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:39,963
Not my wife?

628
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:41,231
Detective gilmore.

629
00:41:41,233 --> 00:41:42,165
Again?

630
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,500
Gimme.

631
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:48,538
Detective. Very busy.
How can I help you?

632
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,807
<i> We have to talk. Now.</i>

633
00:41:51,142 --> 00:41:52,942
Thank you very much, ladies.
Have a good night.

634
00:41:52,944 --> 00:41:54,511
Take care of your tattoos.

635
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:57,614
Too late for a tat?

636
00:41:57,616 --> 00:42:00,683
No. I can get you in tonight,
man. What are you looking to do?

637
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:01,985
Lars around?

638
00:42:02,521 --> 00:42:04,287
He is not around.

639
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:06,122
Too bad.
I heard he was the best.

640
00:42:06,258 --> 00:42:08,791
Lars is good.
But I'm a little better.

641
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:09,559
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

642
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:10,260
Cool.

643
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,570
Give us a minute.

644
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:32,649
We got a situation, sir.

645
00:42:32,651 --> 00:42:33,783
Two minutes, detective.

646
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:36,119
Involving your son.

647
00:42:40,325 --> 00:42:41,090
What?

648
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:46,663
Well, there was a homicide a
couple days ago on the streets

649
00:42:46,665 --> 00:42:49,699
of the short north. Scumbag
nobody's gonna miss. But...

650
00:42:50,201 --> 00:42:53,736
He works for
lemi k's organization.

651
00:42:54,673 --> 00:42:57,340
The word is somebody's
gunning for lemi k's boys.

652
00:42:57,776 --> 00:42:59,976
Well that'd solve a big problem
for me.

653
00:42:59,978 --> 00:43:02,345
Not if we remember
he's a psychopath.

654
00:43:02,347 --> 00:43:03,980
All right,
he'll expose the video.

655
00:43:03,982 --> 00:43:05,648
He's not stupid.
He's planned for that.

656
00:43:06,117 --> 00:43:08,051
Why is he being hit?

657
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,019
We don't know yet.

658
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:12,689
<i>Contain</i> this situation,
detective.

659
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:14,791
That's what I do all day long.

660
00:43:14,793 --> 00:43:18,161
You wanna know how an Irish kid
raised on welfare

661
00:43:18,163 --> 00:43:19,963
became governor...
Hmm?

662
00:43:21,032 --> 00:43:24,334
How a homicide detective
becomes captain?

663
00:43:24,669 --> 00:43:28,805
We contain situations.
We don't blow them up.

664
00:43:36,648 --> 00:43:38,348
There may be civilians involved.

665
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:41,217
Who?

666
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,953
Work with me.

667
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:45,655
Then we'll find out.

668
00:43:50,228 --> 00:43:52,128
We're done here.

669
00:44:04,109 --> 00:44:06,709
So, you know Lars?

670
00:44:06,845 --> 00:44:10,213
Nah, not really.
My daughter does though.

671
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:11,981
She...

672
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:15,885
We've had a falling out
over some of her friends.

673
00:44:15,887 --> 00:44:17,120
One of them Lars?

674
00:44:17,122 --> 00:44:17,854
Yeah.

675
00:44:17,856 --> 00:44:18,421
Yeah.

676
00:44:18,423 --> 00:44:21,858
And another guy. Charlie
something or someone.

677
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:22,659
Eh.

678
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:23,793
Ya know.

679
00:44:23,795 --> 00:44:26,295
I'm probably too overprotective.

680
00:44:26,698 --> 00:44:28,698
Maybe if I met them

681
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,135
or I spent some time with them,
maybe I'd feel differently. But,

682
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:35,171
well we've had a falling out
over that.

683
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:38,708
Eh, but she's old enough to
choose her own friends,

684
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:39,275
you know?

685
00:44:39,277 --> 00:44:42,145
So how long
you owned this place?

686
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:11,074
A locked door means
we're closed.

687
00:45:14,145 --> 00:45:16,212
And this gun means you're open.

688
00:45:17,716 --> 00:45:21,884
Step down here, Princess.
Come on down.

689
00:45:22,854 --> 00:45:24,454
Nice spot you got here, brother.

690
00:45:24,956 --> 00:45:26,255
Yeah, it was.

691
00:45:26,257 --> 00:45:29,225
We just want to ask you
a few questions.

692
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:30,493
Fire away.

693
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:33,813
Well, not literally.

694
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,297
Hijo de la gran puta.
Funny guy, huh?

695
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,835
So, you and your friend
are messing with my boys.

696
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:43,172
Does that freshen your memory?
Who's that?

697
00:45:43,174 --> 00:45:45,508
Look at the fucking picture.
Who is that?

698
00:45:45,944 --> 00:45:47,076
I need a name.

699
00:45:48,279 --> 00:45:50,480
That's a nice tattoo.
Is that a ladybug?

700
00:45:50,482 --> 00:45:51,414
I need a name.

701
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:54,117
All right, do you want me to
look off that thing

702
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:54,917
and try and find...

703
00:46:15,774 --> 00:46:17,240
That really

704
00:46:17,242 --> 00:46:19,075
hurt my leg!

705
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:30,119
Oh, you son of a bitch.
All right, let's go.

706
00:46:38,863 --> 00:46:39,829
Hey, Lars.

707
00:46:39,831 --> 00:46:41,080
What's up?

708
00:46:41,081 --> 00:46:42,330
We were just talking about you.

709
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:43,232
Oh yeah?

710
00:46:43,234 --> 00:46:44,300
Yeah.

711
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:47,403
But I don't want to get involved
in anybody's family business.

712
00:46:47,405 --> 00:46:48,938
Well who can blame you?

713
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,206
Right.

714
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:51,240
Well this is the guy you
originally wanted.

715
00:46:51,242 --> 00:46:53,976
So you mind if he
finishes up here?

716
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:54,477
Yeah.

717
00:46:54,479 --> 00:46:55,211
Is that cool?

718
00:46:55,213 --> 00:46:56,445
Yeah, sure.

719
00:46:58,116 --> 00:46:59,816
Good luck.

720
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:05,521
That's some heavy shit, man.
What is it, biblical?

721
00:47:05,523 --> 00:47:07,990
Yeah, book of Jeremiah.

722
00:47:09,594 --> 00:47:10,827
So,

723
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:14,564
what's this my boy's talking
about? Family business?

724
00:47:14,566 --> 00:47:17,166
Yeah. My daughter, she...

725
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:20,269
She told me you were the best
ink man in town.

726
00:47:20,271 --> 00:47:21,537
Smart girl.

727
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:23,406
What did you say her name was?

728
00:47:23,408 --> 00:47:25,041
Laura. She,

729
00:47:25,243 --> 00:47:29,278
she told me you did this
really cool like fly tattoo

730
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,513
on her friend.

731
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:33,416
I think his name was Charlie
or something.

732
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:35,318
Charlie?

733
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,485
Yeah.

734
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:37,987
Maybe.

735
00:47:38,156 --> 00:47:40,389
Lot of fools
come through here, man.

736
00:47:50,235 --> 00:47:51,868
Not bad.

737
00:47:52,437 --> 00:47:54,036
Don't move.

738
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:56,472
It's still wet.

739
00:48:00,578 --> 00:48:01,978
Get up, asshole.

740
00:48:14,359 --> 00:48:15,157
You.

741
00:48:30,909 --> 00:48:31,407
Come on.

742
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:42,618
Where's Charley?!

743
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,020
I dunno!

744
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:46,389
Take his stash!
It's in the back!

745
00:48:46,391 --> 00:48:47,456
Where is he?!

746
00:49:18,056 --> 00:49:19,288
<i>Stanley, you all right?</i>

747
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:20,489
Something's wrong.

748
00:49:20,491 --> 00:49:22,992
<i>Yeah, I know. Three assholes</i>
<i>just redecorated the barbershop.</i>

749
00:49:22,994 --> 00:49:25,594
<i>Meet me at teto's.</i>
<i>We have garbage to dispose of.</i>

750
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,577
Those assholes who
wanted to dance with me,

751
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:43,713
they were looking for you.

752
00:49:43,715 --> 00:49:45,114
Charley lawes.

753
00:49:45,116 --> 00:49:46,615
That's a good guess.

754
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,087
This was his.

755
00:49:51,556 --> 00:49:54,256
Whoa. That won't go unnoticed.

756
00:49:54,258 --> 00:49:56,759
No. This will bring him
right to us.

757
00:49:56,761 --> 00:49:59,528
All right, let's set up the
sting for tomorrow night.

758
00:50:02,467 --> 00:50:05,735
Hey, Stan! Be careful.
Buckle up.

759
00:51:04,162 --> 00:51:05,528
<i>Stanley?</i>

760
00:51:39,363 --> 00:51:42,598
I know I don't have
the right to be here.

761
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,301
But please...

762
00:51:46,404 --> 00:51:48,838
Tell me when to stop.

763
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:53,742
<i> You made a big change for me</i>
<i> a long time ago.</i>

764
00:52:03,221 --> 00:52:04,820
May I join you?

765
00:52:13,131 --> 00:52:15,164
Grief is a funny thing.

766
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:17,299
It can ruin a man

767
00:52:17,902 --> 00:52:19,535
or make him stronger.

768
00:52:20,238 --> 00:52:22,171
Strange.

769
00:52:23,341 --> 00:52:25,741
Right or wrong,

770
00:52:26,344 --> 00:52:28,244
I have purpose now.

771
00:52:29,347 --> 00:52:31,547
What purpose is that?

772
00:52:36,454 --> 00:52:37,753
Dad?

773
00:52:37,755 --> 00:52:39,622
Did he leave the keys?

774
00:52:39,624 --> 00:52:43,459
I'll go check.
Boxes there and there.

775
00:52:45,296 --> 00:52:48,197
May I ask you a question,
father?

776
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:48,931
Of course.

777
00:52:51,636 --> 00:52:53,169
There are...

778
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:56,238
There are things I've done.

779
00:52:56,574 --> 00:52:58,841
Many years ago.

780
00:53:02,713 --> 00:53:05,381
What do you think, Stan?

781
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:11,754
Is it possible that Vivian died
because of the things I did?

782
00:53:13,558 --> 00:53:17,226
My soul is damned.
I'll never see her again.

783
00:53:17,962 --> 00:53:19,728
Aren't those the rules?

784
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,933
You see this praying card?

785
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:29,371
The man crucified beside him
is known by few.

786
00:53:29,807 --> 00:53:31,440
A thief,

787
00:53:32,443 --> 00:53:34,877
a corrupt man
of the lowest order.

788
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:39,882
And yet moments before his
death, Jesus told him:

789
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:44,954
"Before dawn, we will dwell
together in my father's house."

790
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:48,591
I'm...

791
00:53:48,593 --> 00:53:50,693
I don't understand.

792
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:52,461
It's simple.

793
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:55,264
<i> Whatever your sins are,</i>

794
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,600
<i> they've already been forgiven.</i>

795
00:54:04,842 --> 00:54:07,443
If you have a heavy heart,

796
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:11,780
we have the
sacrament of confession.

797
00:54:14,685 --> 00:54:16,552
Vows of silence.

798
00:54:28,733 --> 00:54:31,333
Bless me father,
for I have sinned.

799
00:54:31,335 --> 00:54:32,668
It's been

800
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:36,972
many years
since my last confession.

801
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:40,743
And these are my...

802
00:54:42,647 --> 00:54:44,913
These are my sins.

803
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:48,284
I've killed many men.

804
00:54:48,286 --> 00:54:52,421
Some for a reason, some not.

805
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,574
Hey, what took you so long?
You okay?

806
00:55:12,576 --> 00:55:13,609
No, I'm not.

807
00:55:13,611 --> 00:55:16,845
We'll talk about it on the way.
I'm running late.

808
00:55:16,847 --> 00:55:17,746
Yeah.

809
00:55:18,749 --> 00:55:19,982
<i> That's the car. Take them out.</i>

810
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:20,816
All right.

811
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:22,051
Let's hurt them.

812
00:55:24,922 --> 00:55:25,921
Here it is.

813
00:55:41,972 --> 00:55:42,971
Abbie!

814
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:44,907
What happened?!

815
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:49,011
Oh my god!

816
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,011
Where did you get hit?
He shot Mike!

817
00:55:50,014 --> 00:55:51,647
Shoulder.

818
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:53,281
Shoulder. Let me see.
Let me see.

819
00:55:53,282 --> 00:55:54,915
Just hold it.
Just hold it right there.
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right.

820
00:55:54,985 --> 00:55:57,386
Here. Take one of these.
Just hold pressure.

821
00:55:57,388 --> 00:55:58,120
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right.

822
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:00,089
Listen. Did you see anything?

823
00:56:00,091 --> 00:56:00,723
No.

824
00:56:00,725 --> 00:56:01,390
Anybody?

825
00:56:01,392 --> 00:56:02,658
A car? A coat?

826
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:04,960
They were after you,
weren't they?

827
00:56:04,962 --> 00:56:06,962
I know what you're doing.
I saw that gun.

828
00:56:06,964 --> 00:56:07,763
Oh come on.

829
00:56:07,765 --> 00:56:09,398
Who's next? Me?

830
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,065
No.

831
00:56:10,067 --> 00:56:11,100
Jimmy?

832
00:56:11,102 --> 00:56:13,068
I promise nothing will ever
happen to you or Jimmy.

833
00:56:13,404 --> 00:56:14,870
It just did.

834
00:56:17,641 --> 00:56:19,141
Let's get him to the hospital.

835
00:56:19,143 --> 00:56:22,644
But just to be safe, I want you
and Jimmy to get to a hotel.

836
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,981
You're telling me
the manager of a car factory

837
00:56:25,983 --> 00:56:27,783
is picking off lemi k's crew?

838
00:56:27,785 --> 00:56:29,551
From what my friend
in the bureau tells me,

839
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:31,387
he used to be in a very
different line of work.

840
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:34,123
Black ops, special forces,
the real ghost stuff.

841
00:56:34,125 --> 00:56:35,624
Are you shitting me?

842
00:56:35,793 --> 00:56:36,992
<i>Your driver's ready.</i>

843
00:56:36,994 --> 00:56:38,994
Baby, give me a second. Will ya?

844
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:46,702
Still, he's just one man.

845
00:56:46,704 --> 00:56:47,736
Two.

846
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:50,606
Apparently he's teamed up
with his old partner.

847
00:56:50,608 --> 00:56:53,108
Deal with it. Or you can forget
about becoming captain.

848
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:54,510
You'll be rotting in a jail.

849
00:56:54,512 --> 00:56:56,745
Yeah?
Right next to you and your son.

850
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:58,480
Don't you threaten me.

851
00:57:00,017 --> 00:57:02,151
Look.
We're gonna make this go away.

852
00:57:02,153 --> 00:57:05,621
Yeah. I'm done with amateurs,
detective.

853
00:57:05,623 --> 00:57:07,856
You get me professionals
to finish this job.

854
00:57:07,858 --> 00:57:09,992
I don't care what it costs.

855
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:16,899
Oh, what a joke.

856
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:23,105
Her right eye's popping right
out of her head.

857
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:25,140
Rich bitch.

858
00:57:46,363 --> 00:57:47,796
Hey. Hold on for a second, man.
I got to take this call, man.

859
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:49,498
Hold on for a minute.

860
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,649
Dude.

861
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:51,799
You're jamming me right now.
I'm trying to...

862
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:52,768
Shut up.

863
00:57:53,003 --> 00:57:54,169
Why are we light, Chuck?

864
00:57:54,171 --> 00:57:57,005
Where the hell is your 50k
shipment from the tattoo parlor?

865
00:57:57,007 --> 00:57:59,007
What? Hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

866
00:57:59,009 --> 00:58:00,776
Yo, we lost some staff, man.

867
00:58:00,778 --> 00:58:02,578
No, we lost a shipment.

868
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:04,079
Now I'm not gonna accuse you.

869
00:58:04,081 --> 00:58:06,248
I'm just gonna find you and jam
a crowbar up your ass

870
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,983
if that shit doesn't reappear
tonight.

871
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:08,684
You understand me?

872
00:58:08,686 --> 00:58:10,819
All right, just chill.
All right?

873
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:13,121
Let me figure this shit out.
I got this.

874
00:58:23,734 --> 00:58:25,601
I got Charley's number.

875
00:58:25,603 --> 00:58:27,736
All right. Let's chit chat.

876
00:58:27,738 --> 00:58:29,104
Mm-hmm.

877
00:58:30,641 --> 00:58:32,174
What the hell?

878
00:58:43,153 --> 00:58:44,520
What?

879
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:52,794
Should we pick the place?

880
00:58:52,796 --> 00:58:55,230
No. Let him.
It'll make him feel safe.

881
00:58:55,232 --> 00:58:57,633
Besides, I know that joint.
It's got plenty of exits.

882
00:58:57,635 --> 00:58:58,967
You still go to clubs?

883
00:58:58,969 --> 00:59:02,037
Eh, I like Korean food.

884
00:59:54,592 --> 00:59:55,724
What can I get you?

885
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:57,326
Scotch on the rocks.

886
00:59:57,328 --> 00:59:59,227
Scotch on the rocks.

887
01:00:09,306 --> 01:00:11,707
Mind if I join you?

888
01:00:12,343 --> 01:00:13,909
Ohhh.

889
01:00:14,712 --> 01:00:16,044
Yeah.

890
01:00:16,347 --> 01:00:17,980
No.

891
01:00:17,982 --> 01:00:20,315
I got to take care
of some business tonight.

892
01:00:20,884 --> 01:00:22,317
Business?

893
01:00:24,922 --> 01:00:26,088
Call me!

894
01:00:26,824 --> 01:00:28,624
Thank you.

895
01:02:09,026 --> 01:02:10,259
You like that?

896
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:11,493
Yeah, I like that.
That's great.

897
01:02:11,495 --> 01:02:13,061
So, you gonna come?

898
01:02:29,813 --> 01:02:30,979
Hey, listen!

899
01:02:30,981 --> 01:02:32,013
Hey, you!

900
01:02:32,015 --> 01:02:33,281
You can't come in here.

901
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:54,970
Everybody stay down!

902
01:02:54,972 --> 01:02:56,471
You got three minutes.

903
01:03:01,512 --> 01:03:03,211
Keep the stash, man! Everything!

904
01:03:03,213 --> 01:03:04,112
I don't want it.

905
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:05,213
Well what do you want?

906
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:07,949
It wasn't an accident that I met
you, was it?

907
01:03:07,951 --> 01:03:10,051
If I tell you, I'm dead.
I'm not fucking stupid.

908
01:03:10,053 --> 01:03:11,453
Who ordered you to kill my wife?

909
01:03:11,455 --> 01:03:13,488
Come on, man.
It wasn't my decision.

910
01:03:17,161 --> 01:03:18,493
Make that one minute!

911
01:03:22,032 --> 01:03:23,265
Lemi k!

912
01:03:23,267 --> 01:03:24,499
It was lemi k!

913
01:03:24,501 --> 01:03:26,368
Lemi k? Why?

914
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:28,103
Why did he have you
kill my wife?

915
01:03:28,105 --> 01:03:30,238
It's not my fault
she's a nosy bitch!

916
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,040
Stan, it's time!

917
01:04:32,135 --> 01:04:33,468
It's a flesh wound.

918
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:37,305
But to answer your question,
yeah I've heard of lemi k.

919
01:04:37,307 --> 01:04:38,506
Okay, who is he?

920
01:04:38,508 --> 01:04:41,009
Some Armenian douchebag
out of Detroit.

921
01:04:41,011 --> 01:04:42,611
Came to Columbus
a couple years back.

922
01:04:42,613 --> 01:04:45,647
Basically took over the drug
trade one block at a time.

923
01:04:45,649 --> 01:04:49,084
Yeah, but Charley lawes
and his gang kick up to him.

924
01:04:49,086 --> 01:04:52,520
Yeah, well word is that lemi k
ate some dude's fingers

925
01:04:52,522 --> 01:04:54,456
in front of his crew.

926
01:04:54,458 --> 01:04:57,225
He's obviously one
of those dramatic types.

927
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:59,027
Good. Predictable.

928
01:04:59,029 --> 01:04:59,561
Yeah. But dangerous.

929
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:02,397
I mean you saw the heat
that he's capable of bringing.

930
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:04,633
Those guys tonight,
they were pros. Now Stan...

931
01:05:04,635 --> 01:05:07,435
You got the guys who murdered
Vivian. Maybe it's time

932
01:05:07,437 --> 01:05:10,305
just to cash in your chips,
head south, and stay there.

933
01:05:10,307 --> 01:05:13,975
No, no, no.
It's not over. It's not over.

934
01:05:18,949 --> 01:05:21,516
<i> Okay, you guys. Ready?</i>
<i> Grandpa wants us to hurry.</i>

935
01:05:24,488 --> 01:05:26,988
Here. Jen, get him dressed.
We need to go.

936
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:28,056
Okay.

937
01:05:28,058 --> 01:05:29,624
Aunt Jenna, it's your turn.

938
01:05:29,626 --> 01:05:31,259
Thank you.

939
01:05:31,995 --> 01:05:33,995
I don't wanna go.

940
01:05:33,997 --> 01:05:34,496
I know.

941
01:05:34,498 --> 01:05:36,932
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Listen to me.

942
01:05:36,934 --> 01:05:38,400
I'm sorry, little man.

943
01:05:38,402 --> 01:05:40,502
But grandpa needs us
to go someplace.

944
01:05:40,504 --> 01:05:41,469
Where?

945
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:44,172
To a hotel. But you know what,
you're gonna love it.

946
01:05:44,174 --> 01:05:45,440
Because they have
an indoor pool.

947
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:46,308
Cool!

948
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:48,076
I know. And guess what?

949
01:05:48,078 --> 01:05:49,577
I packed your bathing suit.

950
01:06:13,370 --> 01:06:16,404
So? How'd it work out
with your boss?

951
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:18,106
Not so good.

952
01:06:18,108 --> 01:06:19,541
Well, what do you mean?

953
01:06:25,082 --> 01:06:29,584
<i>The corner turn pipeline</i>
<i>could be a boon for this state.</i>

954
01:06:29,586 --> 01:06:33,755
My office has commissioned
its own environmental review

955
01:06:33,757 --> 01:06:36,224
to compare with the epa's audit.

956
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:48,370
It's not my fault
she's a nosy bitch!

957
01:06:59,583 --> 01:07:01,383
<i> Vivian hill.</i>

958
01:07:02,452 --> 01:07:05,687
<i> You have one unheard message.</i>

959
01:07:07,758 --> 01:07:10,525
<i> First unheard message.</i>

960
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:13,228
<i>Hey Vivian, it's Glenn. Listen.</i>

961
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:16,131
<i> We can't submit those original</i>
<i> numbers to the governor.</i>

962
01:07:16,133 --> 01:07:18,666
<i> I went over the implications</i>
<i> with him. And</i>

963
01:07:19,102 --> 01:07:22,537
<i>we're gonna have to go with</i>
<i>the revised figures I gave you.</i>

964
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:24,139
<i> We have to.</i>

965
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:30,311
All set? Let's go.

966
01:07:30,514 --> 01:07:33,815
Ugh, I forgot my phone again.

967
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:39,120
Stick around.

968
01:07:39,122 --> 01:07:40,789
Who are you?
What are you doing?

969
01:07:40,791 --> 01:07:42,157
I'm looking for your father.

970
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:43,124
He's not here.

971
01:07:43,126 --> 01:07:43,691
Get him!

972
01:07:44,594 --> 01:07:46,127
Call now!

973
01:07:47,597 --> 01:07:49,364
My phone is in the kitchen.

974
01:07:49,366 --> 01:07:51,066
Go get it. Go get it!

975
01:07:51,068 --> 01:07:51,699
Jenna.

976
01:08:11,188 --> 01:08:11,853
No!

977
01:08:20,497 --> 01:08:22,564
You're next! Understand!

978
01:08:23,667 --> 01:08:25,133
No! No!

979
01:08:29,473 --> 01:08:30,405
Your father.

980
01:08:30,807 --> 01:08:31,840
I want him here!

981
01:08:31,842 --> 01:08:32,740
Now!

982
01:08:32,742 --> 01:08:33,741
Mom!

983
01:08:33,743 --> 01:08:36,144
It's okay, baby.

984
01:08:51,862 --> 01:08:54,462
Dennis, listen.
She never texts me.

985
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:58,233
She called her son Joey, not
Jimmy. No, something's wrong.

986
01:08:58,235 --> 01:09:00,135
<i>I got you.</i>
<i>Give me the address.</i>

987
01:09:00,137 --> 01:09:03,338
All right.
Let me forward it to you.

988
01:09:04,207 --> 01:09:04,772
Done.

989
01:09:04,774 --> 01:09:09,444
Look at me. You be my brave,
brave boy. Okay?

990
01:09:25,862 --> 01:09:29,597
You're not gonna get hurt. I'm
not gonna let anybody hurt you.

991
01:09:29,599 --> 01:09:30,765
You be mommy's brave...

992
01:09:30,767 --> 01:09:32,634
Come here. Chicks and kids.

993
01:09:32,636 --> 01:09:34,335
I hate this shit!

994
01:10:00,330 --> 01:10:00,862
Drop it!

995
01:10:02,265 --> 01:10:02,964
Drop it!

996
01:10:08,905 --> 01:10:09,938
Kick it over.

997
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:15,243
Hands up.

998
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:19,581
Abbie, I got you.

999
01:10:19,883 --> 01:10:22,417
Man, you're a pain in the ass.

1000
01:10:22,419 --> 01:10:24,652
Is your daughter so hard?

1001
01:10:25,555 --> 01:10:28,590
I so want to kill you.

1002
01:10:31,962 --> 01:10:32,961
I'm right here, bitch!

1003
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,283
Abbie!

1004
01:10:55,518 --> 01:10:57,685
Get him upstairs.
Get him upstairs.

1005
01:11:08,298 --> 01:11:08,896
Hey!

1006
01:11:14,671 --> 01:11:16,604
There is no reason on earth

1007
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:19,774
that my wife would have anything
to do with a scumbag like you.

1008
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:20,875
So who's behind this?

1009
01:11:23,513 --> 01:11:26,614
Who is behind it? Who?

1010
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:28,650
It's, it's...
You wouldn't believe me.

1011
01:11:28,652 --> 01:11:29,817
It goes right to the top.

1012
01:11:29,819 --> 01:11:30,952
The governor?

1013
01:11:31,655 --> 01:11:33,321
Did meserve order this hit?

1014
01:11:33,323 --> 01:11:35,590
Did meserve order the hit?!

1015
01:11:45,602 --> 01:11:48,770
He always did have a big mouth.
Freakin' tweaker.

1016
01:11:51,074 --> 01:11:55,977
I guess the cat's out of the
bag, Mr. hill. Bad guy's dead.

1017
01:11:56,846 --> 01:11:57,979
Now.

1018
01:11:58,682 --> 01:12:00,348
You and I work together,

1019
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:02,550
maybe we can put this
all behind us.

1020
01:12:02,552 --> 01:12:04,852
So how do you want to
settle this?

1021
01:12:05,021 --> 01:12:07,088
The easy way
or the hard way?

1022
01:12:08,024 --> 01:12:09,457
The hard way.

1023
01:12:09,459 --> 01:12:11,759
Okay.

1024
01:12:11,761 --> 01:12:14,629
Well that's your call.
But fair is fair.

1025
01:12:14,631 --> 01:12:17,031
I should tell you
i brought my own backup.

1026
01:12:20,603 --> 01:12:21,669
So did I.

1027
01:12:30,113 --> 01:12:31,579
All right.

1028
01:12:31,915 --> 01:12:33,614
Let's rethink this.

1029
01:12:34,751 --> 01:12:35,717
Maybe...

1030
01:12:36,419 --> 01:12:38,052
Maybe there's an easier way.

1031
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:43,591
On come on.

1032
01:12:43,593 --> 01:12:46,527
Can he even breathe back there?

1033
01:12:48,398 --> 01:12:49,630
Exactly

1034
01:12:49,632 --> 01:12:53,868
how do you figure this is gonna
play out for you, Mr. hill?

1035
01:12:54,104 --> 01:12:55,470
I dunno.

1036
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:56,938
What do you think?

1037
01:13:01,144 --> 01:13:04,912
You come after me and my family.

1038
01:13:04,914 --> 01:13:08,783
But there are drug dealers and
murderers left on the street.

1039
01:13:08,785 --> 01:13:10,718
You let my wife's killer go.

1040
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:13,421
You think I don't want to
clip those assholes?

1041
01:13:13,857 --> 01:13:16,924
Why was lemi k untouchable?

1042
01:13:17,894 --> 01:13:19,026
It's a party.

1043
01:13:19,462 --> 01:13:20,928
Lemi k,

1044
01:13:21,097 --> 01:13:23,398
he gets the whole thing
on video.

1045
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:26,100
Including Jr.'s underage
girlfriend seizing up and dying

1046
01:13:26,102 --> 01:13:27,602
from some bad crystal.

1047
01:13:27,604 --> 01:13:30,138
So lemi had him on the short
leash, huh?

1048
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:33,574
Yeah, well it cuts both ways.

1049
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:35,743
Lemi does shit for him too.

1050
01:13:37,113 --> 01:13:38,813
Like murdering my wife?

1051
01:13:39,015 --> 01:13:43,117
Listen, I had nothing to do with
that. Neither did my partner.

1052
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:44,919
Well you do now.

1053
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:46,120
How much farther?

1054
01:13:47,157 --> 01:13:48,122
It's...

1055
01:13:48,124 --> 01:13:50,792
It's just right up ahead.
That's it.

1056
01:13:50,794 --> 01:13:52,560
You make this work.

1057
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:54,929
Hide those cuffs.

1058
01:14:17,153 --> 01:14:19,620
You don't think he knows
you'd try this?

1059
01:14:22,826 --> 01:14:25,793
That's double the normal
security out there.

1060
01:14:25,795 --> 01:14:27,228
That's not your problem.

1061
01:14:27,230 --> 01:14:30,064
Don't be stupid.
Just un-cuff me.

1062
01:14:30,567 --> 01:14:34,869
Let me talk to him for you,
and we'll make all this go away.

1063
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:43,845
<i>Hey! Hey! Let me out of here!</i>

1064
01:14:45,081 --> 01:14:47,615
<i>Hey! I can't breathe!</i>

1065
01:14:49,219 --> 01:14:50,985
Shut up!

1066
01:14:51,788 --> 01:14:54,188
Let me figure this out!

1067
01:15:04,634 --> 01:15:05,900
What?

1068
01:15:53,550 --> 01:15:57,251
<i> There's a cop out at the</i>
<i> south gate. South gate report!</i>

1069
01:16:09,032 --> 01:16:10,131
Don't move!

1070
01:16:29,886 --> 01:16:33,321
You must be Stanley hill.
Black ops turned car guy.

1071
01:16:33,323 --> 01:16:34,689
How many more are there?

1072
01:16:34,991 --> 01:16:36,157
I'm alone.

1073
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:37,658
What do you want?

1074
01:16:37,994 --> 01:16:38,893
Justice.

1075
01:16:39,329 --> 01:16:41,095
Wrong branch of government.

1076
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:44,899
You had my wife killed because
she wouldn't cover up a report.

1077
01:16:44,901 --> 01:16:47,969
I used to be a bottom-feeder
like you, Stanley.

1078
01:16:47,971 --> 01:16:50,204
Following orders
instead of giving them.

1079
01:16:50,206 --> 01:16:51,739
But then I learned the way
the world works.

1080
01:16:51,741 --> 01:16:54,041
The trade-offs that must be made
for the greater good.

1081
01:16:54,043 --> 01:16:55,009
Your greater good.

1082
01:16:56,179 --> 01:16:58,279
Who else knows about that
report?

1083
01:16:58,281 --> 01:16:59,313
Everybody knows.

1084
01:17:00,183 --> 01:17:01,382
Guys like you,

1085
01:17:01,818 --> 01:17:04,251
they fly too close to the vest.

1086
01:17:04,253 --> 01:17:06,354
No. This time I made sure.

1087
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:27,241
Who the hell are you?

1088
01:17:31,948 --> 01:17:36,150
I am wrath.

1089
01:17:38,688 --> 01:17:39,820
Oh my god!

1090
01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:43,157
It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1091
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:45,159
It's over.

1092
01:18:33,943 --> 01:18:35,209
Stanley hill.

1093
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:39,413
We know who you are. Drop your
weapon and raise your hands.

1094
01:18:55,998 --> 01:18:59,033
Drop your weapon
or we will open fire.

1095
01:20:01,030 --> 01:20:03,531
Just check his vitals for me.

1096
01:20:03,533 --> 01:20:06,033
Okay, your father's condition
has stabilized.

1097
01:20:06,035 --> 01:20:08,269
Okay, I've gone ahead
and given the approval

1098
01:20:08,271 --> 01:20:09,436
for him to be transferred
in the morning.

1099
01:20:09,438 --> 01:20:11,205
What do you mean, transferred?

1100
01:20:11,207 --> 01:20:14,375
Umm, perhaps you need to discuss
that with your attorney.

1101
01:20:14,377 --> 01:20:17,878
What is going on?
It's been three days.

1102
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:20,147
When do I get to speak to him?

1103
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:22,550
The da's office
has filed a gag order.

1104
01:20:22,552 --> 01:20:23,551
Of course they have.

1105
01:20:23,553 --> 01:20:26,220
The da's probably just as guilty
as the rest of them.

1106
01:20:26,222 --> 01:20:28,255
They're going to transfer
your father directly

1107
01:20:28,257 --> 01:20:29,557
to a federal prison hospital.

1108
01:20:29,559 --> 01:20:30,457
This is crazy.

1109
01:20:30,459 --> 01:20:32,359
I thought your firm
could help us.

1110
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:34,260
He hasn't even spoken
to a lawyer.

1111
01:20:34,263 --> 01:20:35,863
Because of your father's
background,

1112
01:20:35,865 --> 01:20:40,434
this case has been declared an
issue of national security.

1113
01:20:40,603 --> 01:20:44,505
Oh my god.
He'll be tried in a fisca court.
No jury.

1114
01:20:44,874 --> 01:20:46,207
No lawyer.

1115
01:20:46,209 --> 01:20:49,210
What?
I'm sorry, folks.
Visiting hours are over.

1116
01:20:49,212 --> 01:20:52,513
So what?
I just never see him again?

1117
01:20:52,515 --> 01:20:53,731
We have our orders.

1118
01:20:53,732 --> 01:20:54,948
What do you mean,
visiting hours?

1119
01:20:54,951 --> 01:20:57,084
We haven't been able
to visit him at all.

1120
01:20:57,086 --> 01:20:58,118
Ma'am!

1121
01:20:59,388 --> 01:21:01,555
Ma'am, I need you
to come out here right now.

1122
01:21:01,557 --> 01:21:03,290
I love you.

1123
01:21:03,292 --> 01:21:04,058
Okay, okay. Okay.

1124
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:08,395
Get off of me. I got it. Fine.
I'm sorry, officer.
We're leaving.

1125
01:21:08,397 --> 01:21:09,563
Yes.

1126
01:21:25,514 --> 01:21:26,580
Fellas.

1127
01:21:26,582 --> 01:21:27,615
Hey. What's going on, guys?

1128
01:21:27,617 --> 01:21:29,083
It's been a long day.

1129
01:21:29,085 --> 01:21:31,085
Here to relieve you
for the midnight shift.

1130
01:21:31,087 --> 01:21:32,152
I appreciate that.

1131
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:36,557
Why don't you run and grab us
a couple coffees?

1132
01:21:36,559 --> 01:21:37,424
Okay.

1133
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:13,127
Mr. hill.

1134
01:22:13,129 --> 01:22:15,629
It's time to settle the score
for what you did

1135
01:22:15,631 --> 01:22:17,264
to me and my partner.

1136
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:20,334
You know after I shoot you
for trying to escape,

1137
01:22:20,336 --> 01:22:21,435
I'll be the hero.

1138
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:24,405
They might even let me be a
detective again.

1139
01:22:27,176 --> 01:22:31,278
I got to wonder what's going on
in that mind of yours right now.

1140
01:22:33,683 --> 01:22:36,383
I was thinking about
my daughter.

1141
01:22:36,385 --> 01:22:38,519
How much I love her.

1142
01:22:39,322 --> 01:22:42,289
<i>Ma'am. Ma'am, I need you</i>
<i>to come out here right now.</i>

1143
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:44,091
<i> I love you.</i>

1144
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:46,627
How much I love my wife.

1145
01:22:48,397 --> 01:22:49,163
And you.

1146
01:22:50,366 --> 01:22:52,199
And your partner.

1147
01:22:52,601 --> 01:22:54,601
And that you're just punks.

1148
01:23:02,011 --> 01:23:03,043
Is he dead?

1149
01:23:04,146 --> 01:23:06,547
Well he's not looking that well.

1150
01:23:06,549 --> 01:23:08,549
What were you thinking?
I had him.

1151
01:23:08,551 --> 01:23:12,319
Please. From where I'm sitting,
he had me first.

1152
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:15,422
No. I had him, Stan.
And there's no need to thank me.

1153
01:23:15,424 --> 01:23:18,625
But next time, do me a favor.
Just hold your fire.

1154
01:23:18,627 --> 01:23:19,994
Thank you for what?

1155
01:23:19,996 --> 01:23:21,095
For the rescue.

1156
01:23:21,097 --> 01:23:23,764
The rescue? That's...
You're too late for a rescue.

1157
01:23:23,766 --> 01:23:24,498
Really?

1158
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,067
Yeah.

1159
01:23:26,068 --> 01:23:27,635
Really? What was...
What was your plan

1160
01:23:27,636 --> 01:23:29,203
after you emptied your clip
from a hospital bed?

1161
01:23:29,205 --> 01:23:31,271
You gonna fight the cops off
with your bedpan?

1162
01:23:31,273 --> 01:23:33,073
It was a one step plan.

1163
01:23:33,075 --> 01:23:35,009
That's all I'm sayin'.

1164
01:23:35,011 --> 01:23:37,144
Fortunately,
i have a multi-step plan.

1165
01:23:37,146 --> 01:23:39,313
And I packed a little bag
for you.

1166
01:23:39,315 --> 01:23:40,247
Where are we going?

1167
01:23:40,549 --> 01:23:42,016
Well hopefully

1168
01:23:42,451 --> 01:23:44,218
anyplace but a
federal penitentiary.

1169
01:23:44,220 --> 01:23:45,486
You got three minutes.

1170
01:23:55,564 --> 01:23:58,465
Got a jet waiting for us in
Cincinnati. We'll fly south,

1171
01:23:58,467 --> 01:24:00,534
gas up in ixtapa,
and keep going.

1172
01:24:00,536 --> 01:24:02,569
I saved your ass last time
in ixtapa.

1173
01:24:02,571 --> 01:24:04,338
No, I saved your ass.

1174
01:24:04,774 --> 01:24:08,809
<i>Security, there's</i>
<i>been a breach in icu ward 3.</i>

1175
01:24:08,811 --> 01:24:13,047
<i> Repeat. Security. All stand by</i>
<i> orderlies report immediately.</i>

1176
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:35,402
Thank you.

1177
01:24:35,404 --> 01:24:36,470
You're a wild man.

1178
01:24:36,472 --> 01:24:37,304
I'm not wild!

1179
01:24:37,306 --> 01:24:38,705
Yes, you are. You're a wild man.

1180
01:24:38,707 --> 01:24:40,441
No, I am not! No, I am not!

1181
01:24:50,186 --> 01:24:54,788
<i> My darling Abbie, I'm alive</i>
<i> and well, thanks to you.</i>

1182
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:56,623
<i> You truly are my daughter.</i>

1183
01:24:56,625 --> 01:25:01,361
<i>Until we meet again, my heart is</i>
<i>with you and Michael and Jimmy.</i>

1184
01:25:01,797 --> 01:25:03,397
<i> Love, dad.</i>
