But they did what they was supposed to.

00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,712

00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,529
All the dumb shit.

243
00:18:26,529 --> 00:18:28,226
We gotta get your money, man.

244
00:18:28,226 --> 00:18:32,442
Cause we need to be gone out of town, man.

245
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:39,070
Man, we gotta clean up our mess, man.

246
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:42,269
We gotta clean up loose ends, remember?

Loose ends. You with me?

248
00:18:44,388 --> 00:18:48,221
You're trying to still
kill this nigga or not?

249
00:18:49,468 --> 00:18:50,535
What the fuck we look

00:18:50,535 --> 00:18:52,963
around this town if we merc a nigga.

251
00:18:52,963 --> 00:18:54,394

Goddamn, man. I think
I left it in the car.

255
00:19:04,537 --> 00:19:07,370
You just gotta hope Erica answers.

256
00:19:09,397 --> 00:19:10,276

257
00:19:10,276 --> 00:19:12,224

261
00:19:20,853 --> 00:19:24,971
Lets go ahead and get out
of here before it gets dark.

262
00:19:24,971 --> 00:19:26,341
You talk to Enre?

263
00:19:26,341 --> 00:19:27,780
- Hell, nah.

264
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,530
- That nigga still mad, ain't he?

265
00:19:37,572 --> 00:19:39,364
- Get that mother fucking money.

266
00:19:39,364 --> 00:19:41,018
I'm gonna get her ass here too.

267
00:19:41,018 --> 00:19:43,518
Fucking with Doom, dumb bitch.

268
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:45,391
I'm a boss.

269
00:20:04,017 --> 00:20:05,434
- What she doing?

270
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:12,993
- Price. Don't ever send
me to the voicemail again.

271
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,741
And I aint talked to you all
day, but anyway, I'm sitting

272
00:20:16,741 --> 00:20:17,890
up here trying to order some more stuff

273
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:21,160
and they talking about it declined.

274
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,010
So I go check the account
and our account's frozen.

275
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,680
And I'm trying to figure out how

276
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,060
as much money as you put in there.

277
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,610
So you either making
too large of a purchase

278
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:33,420
and places we ain't
going that they think we,

279
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,700
I mean, what's going on?

280
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,280
You taking out too much money.

281
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,913
Wait, these folks need to tell me now.

282
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,873
I'm not even tripping.

283
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,013
You got money where?

284
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,013
Really Prise?

285
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,290
I just don't understand
like why you keep taking

286
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:15,210
out so much money?

287
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,920
Prise. This is too much.

288
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,110
I'm putting some of this in the account.

289
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,220
Cause it's going to make no sense.

290
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,780
I'm sorry that my vendor
isn't somewhere where

291
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,383
I can just pay her cash.

292
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,170
But this is too much.

293
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,050
Like you've done this before.

294
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,320
You just keep taking money
out and just leaving it places

295
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,523
and then you don't need
to tell me it was there.

296
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,938
You know what?

297
00:21:33,938 --> 00:21:34,771
I don't care.

298
00:21:34,771 --> 00:21:35,604
All right, bye whatever.

299
00:21:35,604 --> 00:21:37,007
I'm putting some of this in the account.

300
00:21:37,007 --> 00:21:39,783
- I'm gonna do what the
fuck I tell her to do, man.

301
00:21:43,841 --> 00:21:45,624
Yeah I'm coming my boy.

302
00:21:45,624 --> 00:21:46,896
I'm just getting my mind right.

303
00:21:46,896 --> 00:21:48,729
We finna do this shit.

304
00:22:05,225 --> 00:22:08,392
- I'm gonna pimp a goddamn fool, bruh.

305
00:22:18,202 --> 00:22:21,568
I'm finna go smoke this goddamn man.

306
00:22:21,568 --> 00:22:23,985
Gonna smoke that goddamn boy.

307
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,810
- Now, honestly between you,

308
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:41,730
I think Prise and Diego has some.

309
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,320
Something ain't right.

310
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,417
Them niggas sneaky and
both of them black as hell.

311
00:22:46,417 --> 00:22:49,393
And you already know two black
niggas together at night.

312
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,870
It ain't gonna be a good sight.

313
00:23:23,371 --> 00:23:24,411
- You good?

314
00:23:24,411 --> 00:23:25,461

Look for shawty, but she wasn't there.

Ain't no way in hell he gone

He reminded me of myself

726
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:01,593
Either way, lets get back to the show.

727
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,345
- Can you see me back?

728
00:52:07,345 --> 00:52:09,040
- So happy your ass bring me some food

731
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:18,021
- Pack? For what? Where you're going?

732
00:52:18,021 --> 00:52:19,604
- You too. You too.

00:52:21,877 --> 00:52:23,250
- See I knew it was some shit.

734
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:25,300
I'm not doing this with you today.

735
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:27,270
I'm not doing this with you.

736
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:30,422
Come on Prise, you can't be serious?

737
00:52:30,422 --> 00:52:33,660
- We're good. Yes, we're good.

738
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:35,160
- Boy, I'm not doing this with you today.

739
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,140
Like you, this is what I be talking about.

740
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:38,630
You don't take life seriously.

741
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:39,540
Are you even thinking?

742
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:40,644
Do you even hear yourself?

743
00:52:40,644 --> 00:52:42,247
- I told you I was
serious when I said I was

744
00:52:42,247 --> 00:52:43,156
on the run right now.

745
00:52:43,156 --> 00:52:43,989
- What about Nala?

746
00:52:43,989 --> 00:52:44,822
What about the new
school she just started?

747
00:52:44,822 --> 00:52:46,190
- What about Nala? She can come too.

748
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:47,743
- I'm in school, like really?

749
00:52:52,762 --> 00:52:55,550
- For real, like you

750
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:56,383
But do what you wanna do.

751
00:52:56,383 --> 00:52:57,647
Stay, I don't care.

752
00:52:57,647 --> 00:53:01,810
Stay.
- You know what?

753
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:03,710
I'm so sick of it.

754
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:04,543
If that's what you wanna do,

755
00:53:04,543 --> 00:53:07,370
that's fine, I'm not
gonna beg you for shit.

756
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:09,713
All you ever think about
is your fucking self.

757
00:53:12,651 --> 00:53:14,753
- Man, you quit tripping on me.

758
00:53:14,753 --> 00:53:16,086

759
00:53:16,997 --> 00:53:19,150

00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:19,983
Hello?

00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:31,640
I don't want to go to Florida, man.

00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,460
I got some going on Midland, man.

766
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,610

I ain't trying to turn up, man.

768
00:53:36,443 --> 00:53:38,322
I'm trying to get myself together.

769
00:53:38,322 --> 00:53:40,537
- Imma tell you like,

770
00:53:40,537 --> 00:53:43,370

771
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:45,483
You feel like what I got going on, man?

772
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:48,563
It fit the situation right now, bro.

773
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:51,730
- You talked to Bert?

774
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:53,677
- Hell naw, I aint talking to that nigga.

775
00:53:58,490 --> 00:53:59,323

I got to blow me one before I leave, man.

779
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,800
That'd be Batman.

780
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,860
Prise will be here in second though.

781
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:10,839

782
00:54:10,839 --> 00:54:15,839
- All right.

783
00:54:29,302 --> 00:54:31,248
Who pulled up?

784
00:54:51,256 --> 00:54:55,970
- This nigga Prise don't

785
00:54:55,970 --> 00:54:56,803
Hey bro.

786
00:54:56,803 --> 00:54:57,637

791
00:55:14,401 --> 00:55:16,261

792
00:55:16,261 --> 00:55:17,530
Clear his mind or something, I don't know.

793
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:18,580
He'll be back though.

794
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:20,533
- Fuck on your mind man?

795
00:55:20,533 --> 00:55:22,592
Your problem solved.

- He don't really want to leave like shit.

799
00:55:31,175 --> 00:55:33,486
The best situation right now.

800
00:55:33,486 --> 00:55:36,173
I understand, man, but shit.

00:57:48,766 --> 00:57:49,947
- This nigga hasn't phoned, bruh.

825
00:57:49,947 --> 00:57:52,139
He's been gone an hour or something,

This is Lieutenant Parker.

00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:53,730
I've actually been in contact with two

839
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:57,223

I'm going to deal with this shit like.

847
00:59:16,413 --> 00:59:17,996
Look at this bitch.

Fuck that bitch at man?

Got my whole heart fucked up.

00:59:59,816 --> 01:00:01,983
Run on there, run on them.

860
01:00:46,825 --> 01:00:49,242
