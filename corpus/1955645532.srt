1
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,440
[Brent] Fred!

2
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,060
- What?
- You gonna sleep all day?

3
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,250
- What time is it?
- 8am

4
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,040
- In the morning?
- Yeah, come on.

5
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:29,140
I want you to help me
put the shelf locks on.

6
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,170
It's Saturday.

7
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,219
We're going to put
together a baby sling.

8
00:00:32,459 --> 00:00:35,180
Isn't the baby a little
young for a sling?

9
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,120
It's for the sink.

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,730
They say most fatal injuries
happen in the bath.

11
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,120
Who are "they"?

12
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:44,490
Also my mom is coming by.

13
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,740
I can't handle this.

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,260
[Brent] Good Morning!

15
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,700
Fred! Get in the shower!

16
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,560
[power tool whines]

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,980
Oh, my god.

18
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,260
[hammer pounds]

19
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,760
Oh!

20
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,560
Brent!

21
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,160
[Brent] I don't even know what this is.

22
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,440
[Rose] Handsome, stop worrying.

23
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,970
[Rose] Watch this.

24
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,080
- This is my pet peeve.
- Put that down.

25
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,300
- I don't want to watch videos.
- Shhh!!

26
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,250
So, there's the cat,

27
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,870
lapping up the milk...

28
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,330
they put the cucumber behind him...

29
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,760
he turns around and...

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,980
[meow!!]

31
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,620
Every time!

32
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:10,120
Stop!

33
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,680
I love it!

34
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,770
What's the matter? What's wrong?

35
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,380
This baby is less than a month away

36
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,880
and we are not ready.

37
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,080
Come on, honey, you're ready.

38
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,620
You're ready, stop worrying.

39
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,520
Look at all this crap.

40
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,920
What the hell is this?

41
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,470
A protective baby cone—

42
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,920
it goes around the baby's head

43
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,240
so it doesn't hit its head.

44
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,320
Do you hear yourself?

45
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,750
Yes. OK, soon to be Grandma?

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,300
This is on the essentials list

47
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,760
at Babies R Us.

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,200
That is, this is, that is.

49
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,240
What's that crap?

50
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,290
That is a very important

51
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,320
turquoise piece of

52
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,480
overprotective baby crap.

53
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,320
Come on, honey,

54
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,850
you guys will be great.

55
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,480
Sit down. Look at me.

56
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,520
You know how to do this. You're smart.

57
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,030
You have a big heart.

58
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:56,573
You'll be fine.

59
00:02:56,856 --> 00:02:57,780
Did you breastfeed me?

60
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,490
Of course. With these boobs?

61
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,220
I could be sitting in the living room

62
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,270
and breastfeed in the bedroom.

63
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,370
Of all the people we know
who should not be parents...

64
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:07,570
Yeah?

65
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,210
You'll be fine, all right?
You're gonna kill it.

66
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,686
- The baby.
- Yes.

67
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,730
- You're a terrible mother.
- I know it.

68
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,240
Where is your husband?
Shouldn't he be the voice of reason?

69
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,820
I can't believe I just said that.

70
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,180
He's in the "edit cave."

71
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,150
And no one's allowed in there.

72
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,700
Still working on that thing?

73
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,530
When will I get my investment back?

74
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,120
Bears don't pay for films.

75
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,000
That's the flaw in the plan.

76
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,240
[Rose] Hey, Papa Fred.

77
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,950
Hey, Mom! I'm so sorry,

78
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,500
I got distracted. How are you?

79
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,520
Great! I'm so excited for
my granddaughter to come.

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,600
I'll buy her non-sexist toys,
wooden, handmade...

81
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,200
- Cool.
- I'll take her on protest marches.

82
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,690
I'll take her to Burning Man.

83
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,240
We'll both be naked.

84
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,540
And lots of sugar.

85
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,030
I'll get her candy
and pie and cake!

86
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,920
We don't know if it
will be a girl yet...

87
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,490
Bite your tongue, it's a girl.

88
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:57,470
Hey, wait!

89
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,920
How are you doing on my...

90
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,100
your documentary?

91
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,620
It's coming along great,
it will be amazing.

92
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,080
I'm working on it right now.

93
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,440
Come sit down, please.

94
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,130
[phone rings]
That's Max, my editor.

95
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,290
I'm going to take this call
in the other room.

96
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,640
Go ahead, Tarantino.

97
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,180
See? Lost, completely lost.

98
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:19,670
He seems fine.

99
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,560
He's not freaked out
or overly concerned.

100
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,010
He's not concerned at all!

101
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,050
That's the problem.

102
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,820
'Cause he's in there in the dark,
tinkering away at the movie,

103
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,600
and not worried about anything
like being a dad in a month!

104
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,406
I need a drink.
Make me a Bloody Mary.

105
00:04:31,693 --> 00:04:33,630
- It's 10am.
- It has tomato juice.

106
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,930
It does have vitamins.

107
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,520
And celery! I love a
cocktail with food in it.

108
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,210
Would you like a burrito martini?

109
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,940
Yes! Olives...

110
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,520
Bacon margarita.

111
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,610
What are you doing?

112
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:44,920
Trying to push the button.

113
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,280
Oh, god, let me do it.

114
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,500
Ta da!

115
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,680
Grandma of the Year.

116
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,970
Shouldn't you be wearing a
French maid outfit to do that?

117
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,990
Honey, you've got to get dressed.

118
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,760
Your daughter arrives in a half hour.

119
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,760
It's so hot in that kitchen.

120
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,760
If you can't take the heat...

121
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,760
So that's how you want to play.

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,840
Maybe I do.

123
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,060
Mmm, hmm.

124
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,820
Come here.

125
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,640
Shoot!

126
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,300
I'm sorry—I was trying
to fix it. It got stuck.

127
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,420
Stop.

128
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,240
I'm not asking you to
delete Carlos from your life.

129
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,920
I know, but of all days...

130
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,580
Michael—

131
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,900
what happened to you was tragic.

132
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,240
I can't begin to understand your loss.

133
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,880
But I do know that I love you.

134
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,710
And I'm willing to wait.

135
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,350
Because we are worth waiting for.

136
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:42,450
[smoke alarm sounds]
Whoa, my sweet buns!

137
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,150
Those sweet buns look
really nice from here.

138
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,360
[doorbell buzzes]

139
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,320
- Shit, she's here!
- Oh, gosh!

140
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,400
I thought I was supposed
to be the nervous one!

141
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,700
[Michael] You look great!

142
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,510
Your dad's getting dressed...

143
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,180
just be a minute.

144
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,530
You know how dads are.

145
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,270
Would you rather put your...

146
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,970
that's fine, leave it there.

147
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,520
Emma!

148
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:37,080
I'm so glad to finally be able to
invite you into my home.

149
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,430
Look—

150
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,220
I know this was my dad's idea.

151
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,880
You should be flattered.

152
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,790
It means he probably loves you.

153
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,520
Well, I love him, too.

154
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,560
Yeah, I know. The point is,

155
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,600
you guys always find
a way to screw him over

156
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,030
and I end up having this
exact same conversation

157
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,840
every few years in a
different fat guy's living room.

158
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,180
So, let's just play nice
and get this over with.

159
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,216
[Dalton] Here's my little girl!

160
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,640
Hi, Daddy!

161
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,020
Look at you, all dressed to suppress.

162
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,000
Michael picked it out for me.

163
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,690
My ninja has style.

164
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,680
He sure does.

165
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,030
Thank you, Michael, for
having me in your home.

166
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,440
Thank you for coming.

167
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,560
My pleasure.

168
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,090
What did you make, Daddy?

169
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,380
It smells like you
burned the house down.

170
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,740
I didn't exactly burn it down.

171
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,230
Made some sweet buns.

172
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,890
James, I just need a

173
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,870
mic stand, a stool, and a

174
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,690
cable for my guitar, please.

175
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,000
I'll take care of it.

176
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,060
Thanks.

177
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,900
Hey, Roger.

178
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:01,890
Kyle.

179
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,660
Sorry to hear about Nate and...

180
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,240
your situation.

181
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,850
Shit happens, right?

182
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:09,820
Yeah.

183
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,250
Can I get you a drink?

[Dalton] Did you just hack
his picture frame?

No.

What am I, a noob?

Isn't that why we're all here?

Yes. But look,

233

if you want to know something, just ask.

234
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,720
He's right here. And I'm right here...

235
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,850
with him.

236
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,510
Okay. Well, this app
isn't working anyway.

237
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,640
It said he was
knifed outside a bar at 4am.

238
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,470
He owned the bar!!

239
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,750
It was 4:43am to be exact.

240
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,640
They robbed him...

241
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,420

I'm so sorry, Dad.

It's like you don't want me to be happy!

250

No, I just...

251
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,310
I mean, what do you
really know about him?

252
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,670
You haven't been with him for a year
and we're already having "the lunch."

That's right! We were!

You're too trusting, Daddy.

Oh, baby, that's not true.
You both made that decision.

You'd have to eat a lot of donuts

You're meeting Dalton's daughter, right?

It's not what I did.

she hacked my photo frame,

pulls up a picture of Carlos, runs it
through some fucking face recognition app

to me at the table!

Do not fuck with that girl.

308
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,820

- You wanted to do a sneak preview.

365
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,440
We'll get some buzz
going before Outfest.

366
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,080
You are such the producer.

367
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,920
I want to thank the Academy.

368
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,430
And my agent.

369
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,140
I'm not going.

370
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,090
Why?

371
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,180
Tyler lives there now.
I don't want him to know

372
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,800
what a shit show my life's become.

373
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,750
'Cause we're not telling him all the time?

374
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:43,800
I'm kidding...

375
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,220
Rog, the film isn't finished,

376
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,820
don't worry—we're not going.

377
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,400
You should hear him and Max.

378
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,220
[Brent] We gotta lock it down.

379
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,140
- We have no sound mix, no credits.
- Baby, it's done!

380
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,970
- We don't have any...
- Ring, ring!

381
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,560
Max? Hi. He wants to
talk to you—he quit.

382
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,720
That phone never gets old.

383
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,260
Wait—go back.

384
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,120
Further back.

385
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,000
[Fred] Right there.

386
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,020
[Max] This has the corrupt audio...

387
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,410
[Fred] It's okay.

388
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:15,390
Play it.

389
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,770
[Father on screen] We want chocolate!
Give it to us!

390
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,220
[Father on screen] Yeah!

391
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,055
[laughter on screen]

392
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:24,715
[Father on screen] We'll
give it to your sister.

393
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,200
That's it.

394
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,160
You okay?

395
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
Yeah.

396
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,150
I'm good. Moving on.

397
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,200
We've been in here
for six months now.

398
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,340
I know when you're good
and this ain't it.

399
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,020
So what's going on?

400
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,520
I don't know...

401
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,520
it feels like everything
is moving so fast.

402
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,900
We're just... skyrocketing.

403
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,140
Suzie was so happy to help us out, and...

404
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:58,320
You're worrying about being a bad dad?

405
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,520
No. No, I'm not.

406
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,640
I'm worried about being a great dad.

407
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,660
What makes you think you won't be?

408
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,000
I don't think I won't be.

409
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,840
I want to believe that I have something...

410
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,840
unique to offer this kid.

411
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,310
Something to prepare him... or her...
whatever... for...

412
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,420
I don't know...

413
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,390
...a perspective. You know?

414
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,800
That only Brent and I

415
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,800
can offer this child.

416
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:38,400
So he or she knows how to appreciate life.

417
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,440
You know?

418
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,540
I don't know what I'm talking about.

419
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,200
Hey—I'm sorry.

420
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,200
Shut up, that was fucking beautiful.

421
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,360
It's just that my father never
thought about any of that shit.

422
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,040
Not one minute.

423
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,120
I thought you didn't know your dad.

424
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,520
I knew who he was.

425
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,390
My mom showed me who he was

426
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,010
and what building he lived in,

427
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,530
but that was about it.

428
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,480
You never talked to him?

429
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,660
I'd pass him now and then...

430
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,240
...and he knew who I was, too.

431
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,580
But he never looked at me.

432
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,450
That sucks.

433
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,300
So, you think you can
do better than that?

434
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,660
I do.

435
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,540
Yeah.

436
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,320
Thank you.

437
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,240
So, that's why we've been
editing this picture to death.

438
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,720
No, we've been editing it to death
because it's not done.

439
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,560
Oh, sweet pea, it is done.

440
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,190
And I mean done—

441
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,460
done, overdone, redone.

442
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,160
Hey! What are you doing in here?

443
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,630
You don't just burst in
like that, sweetheart!

444
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,380
I'm the Producer! I do what I want.

445
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,530
She ain't wrong.

446
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,200
Where did you get this?

447
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,060
I made it.

448
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,040
So, according to this,

449
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,690
we are showing our movie

450
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,040
next week at The Woods.

451
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,990
Exactly! Which is why I want this
picture done immediately, please.

452
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,060
- Done.
- Thank you.

453
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,000
What?

454
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,100
He's obviously wearing
the pants in the family.

455
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,000
I ain't trying to get
on Daddy's bad side.

456
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,260
- I am the daddy here, not him.
- Okay, Daddy.

457
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,380
Max!

458
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,400
Got it. Picture lock—done.

459
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,620
Thank you. Love you.

460
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,860
What is happening here?

461
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,390
Okay, get out of here

462
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:17,640
because apparently

463
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,060
we have a film to finish.

464
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,360
[Brent] It stinks in here.

465
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,720
I love you.

466
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,600
Not a word out of you.

467
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,020
Okay, Mama.

468
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,140
Let's do this.

469
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,700
Thank you.

470
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,860
Get out of here!

471
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,720
- No, no, no!
- You are running out of time.

472
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,640
You want another one?!

473
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,520
What are you doing?

474
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,860
I have to look good for their
premiere. It's the movie!

475
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,640
I already packed your
outfit for the premiere.

476
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,600
You did?

477
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,590
Yes.

478
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,760
Did you call for the car?

479
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,220
I called for the car.

480
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,510
You think of everything.

481
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,950
Okay... Michael, I just wanted to say that

482
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:28,860
I really wasn't... fair... whatever.

483
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,390
[sighs] So, Michael, I just...

484
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:34,040
I wanted to apologize for...

485
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:38,400
...hacking... for hurting your f...

486
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,540
Look...

487
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,240
...people lie.

488
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,360
And they hurt my mom

489
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,820
and they hurt my dad.

490
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,860
And I just don't live in a world

491
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,760
where people don't...

492
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,760
...lie or hurt.

493
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,280
[elevator bell dings]

494
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,800
You must be Dalton's daughter.

495
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:00,770
Yes.

496
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:04,140
Can you tell your dad
that his car is ready?

497
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,670
He isn't answering his phone.

498
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,440
I've got a lobby full of people.

499
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,460
Yeah.

500
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,400
Thank you.

501
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,160
[Michael grunting]

502
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,900
[Dalton laughing] Oh, my god!

503
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,960
You are the cutest thing ever.

504
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,820
I love you so much, Michael.

505
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,450
If you love me so much,

506
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,100
get over here and help me zip this bag.

507
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,880
Let's close it on "three."

508
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,070
One!

509
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,780
Two!

510
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,000
Three!

511
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,120
Oh, thank god!

512
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,100
Where the hell was that?

513
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,300
It was on the floor... there.

514
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,080
Must have fallen out of my pocket.

515
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:21,960
I thought you said you stopped
carrying that thing around.

516
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,310
I did, but when I travel...

517
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,330
What the hell is wrong with you, Michael?!

518
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,120
It's two years old...

519
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,960
still got fuckin' blood stains on it!

520
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,240
You're never gonna let go of him, are you?

521
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,140
It was the only thing left at the scene.

522
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,840
He was bringing that home for me.

523
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,960
It's fucking jerky, Michael!

524
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,820
It's all I have left!

525
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,150
[Dalton] You're never gonna let me in,

526
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,190
are you? Hmm?

527
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,700
In that big fuckin' heart of yours...

528
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,720
that heart...

529
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,050
that I fell in love with...

530
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,840
you're never gonna make room.

531
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,260
That's not true.

532
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:28,300
I love you. I do.

533
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,500
I just gotta have some more time.

534
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,790
I'm gonna take this to the car.

535
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,960
[On screen] What would you tell

536
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,220
bears and cubs who are just
discovering the Bear community?

537
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,860
Some of the reasons you might
feel insecure about yourself

538
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,660
will be the reasons that the
Bear community will celebrate you.

539
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,220
So let out that 50-inch waist,
that rug on your back, and

540
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,960
just have fun at
the party, honey!

541
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,540
- Aww.
- I love that.

542
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,300
It's great.

543
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,160
Yeah, it is.

544
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,640
We got a movie?

545
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,800
We got a movie.

546
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,600
- Let's go camping!
- Yeah!

547
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,620
You're coming?

548
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,450
Cheeseburger?

549
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:36,760
Cheeseburger?

550
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,700
Oh!

551
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:48,910
Hey, Joe!

552
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,580
Howdy!

553
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,710
[Carol-Lee] You have such a
very long life line.

554
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,030
[Doug] That's so not true.

555
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,880
The palm doesn't lie—you be quiet.

556
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,160
Mom, what are you doing?

557
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,410
I'm reading a palm.

558
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,740
Of course you are.

559
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,060
Next.

560
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,700
Your ring finger is higher
than your pointer finger.

561
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,440
Which indicates...

562
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,890
that you were born gay.

563
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,810
Do you know that?

564
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,350
No. I'm totally gay though.

565
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,680
[Dan] Obviously.
[Doug] Seriously gay.

566
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,980
Mom, where the hell is Tyler?

567
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:54,340
[phone vibrates]

568
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,780
Sorry... umm...

569
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,730
Luke.

570
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:04,790
Luke! Yes! It's my producer.
I've got to take this. Sorry.

571
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,200
You can try.

572
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,480
Hi, Michael?

573
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:12,850
Michael? Hi. Can you hear me?

574
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,200
No, it's okay. I'm just...

575
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:19,050
I'm at work. What's up?

576
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,000
Stop!

577
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,790
Nothing—just some guy.
What's going on?

578
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,390
What did you say?

579
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:29,090
Michael, you're breaking up,
I can't hear you.

580
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,980
Michael?

581
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,770
Fuck! Service out here sucks.

582
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:35,490
"Some guy"?

583
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:37,620
Come on, you know...

584
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,300
You're supposed to wait until you're

585
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,000
out of the trick's bed before you...

586
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,240
Sorry, it's complicated.

587
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,010
I know. I read your profile.

588
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,020
Is everything okay?

589
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:51,030
My friend's bringing
some kid... E... Eric?

590
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,660
I couldn't understand him.

591
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,940
[Simon] Emma! Dalton is
bringing his kid Emma here!

592
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,920
Jesus, Simon, you
scared the shit out of us!

593
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,100
You're totally getting coal
this year, little boy.

594
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,040
Gross.

595
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,160
What did you just say?

596
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,900
Dalton is bringing his daughter here.

597
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,360
Why? It's an 18 and over
campground.

598
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,540
John Adam will never let them in.

599
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,320
I know! We have to go to the office!

600
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,600
How did you just find me?

601
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:12,890
Duh.

602
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,650
Plus, I have you on my Rape Buddy app.

603
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,080
They have an app for that?

604
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,930
That's super creepy, Simon.

605
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,480
I gotta go.

606
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,180
Go, Julie cruise director.

607
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,700
Back to work.

608
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,900
I'm actually just Julie's assistant.

609
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,700
Oh, uh, uh, bitch!

610
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,300
Byeeee! Wait...

611
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:35,680
[Simon] Tyler!

612
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,980
[Fred] Bears! Yay!
[Brent] ♪ Bears in The Woods! ♪

613
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,990
[Fred] The place looks amazing.

614
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,000
[Brent] I can't believe
I've never been here.

615
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,810
[Brent] Pink golf cart! It's my drag name!

616
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,040
Hi!

617
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,080
Baby sister!

618
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:58,710
I don't wanna touch your...

619
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,430
Oh, Fred, you're not gonna break him.

620
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,430
Him?!

621
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:05,090
Him? Her? I don't know.
Stop reading into shit. Gimme some love.

622
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,700
Oh my god, I just felt him kick.

623
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,800
See? Kicks like a him, right?

624
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,320
Yeah. Fred, feel that.

625
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,000
I don't have to touch my sister's...

626
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,770
There'll be plenty of time for that.

627
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:17,050
Walk with me. I've got to
fill the condom buckets

628
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:19,190
at the Welcome Center.
[Brent] "Welcome Center"?

629
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:21,200
[Fred] The head shed?
[Susan] "The Pavilion."

630
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,160
Oh, right: gay people.

631
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,810
Pregnant lady. Heavy bucket.

632
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,250
Oh, sorry!

633
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,350
[Susan] Isn't this pretty?

634
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,270
[Brent] Yeah!
[Fred] Gorgeous!

635
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:38,230
Well done!

636
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,700
Uh, that's why they call it "The Woods."

637
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,700
Fred, look! A rare
African American Sling Lizard.

638
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,180
Just gonna wait for
someone to show up...

639
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,510
...order a pizza.

640
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:54,100
Fred—are you excited about
the preview tomorrow?

641
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,700
I wish I had another week to edit.

642
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,300
I think I could make it perfect.

643
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,570
Stop it. I'm sure it's great.

644
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,480
You've always been your own worst critic.

645
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,130
Amen, sister, thank you.

646
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:07,090
Hey, Dick Dynasty.

647
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:11,480
Hi, guys.

648
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,490
Wrap it up, Derek.

649
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:17,290
You know you can use tree sap
as lubricant in a pinch.

650
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,150
It's like super glue.

651
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,280
Check him for ticks later—
he's pretty fuzzy.

652
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,710
I know you're excited, Brent.

653
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,200
We're gonna be great dads.

654
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,170
Right, Fred?

655
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:29,300
Yes, we will be great dads.

656
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,060
Okay, that's happening—

657
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,460
a scene from Deliverance.

658
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,790
I want to thank you.

659
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,660
I appreciate what you're doing for us.

660
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,840
Save it. I'm so happy for both of you.

661
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:40,800
Thank you.

662
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,620
Why are you doing this? Let me do it.

663
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,670
Why aren't Simon and Tyler doing it?

664
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:47,110
They're the worst
employees I've ever had.

665
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,250
Thanks a lot, Fred.

666
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:50,950
That is not my fault.

667
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:52,930
I'm gonna get them down here.

668
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:54,510
Great, no bars.

669
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,960
Because fags like to vacation
in the middle of nowhere.

670
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,010
Look at you, protecting your baby mama.

671
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,670
I'm actually protecting my baby,
but you're part of it, so...

672
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,000
You should see him at home,
baby-proofing the dildos.

673
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,290
- How do you...?
- Don't ask.

674
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,210
- Why do you guys...?
- Seriously, don't ask.

675
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,030
This is actually very serious.

676
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,750
I want this kid to have everything.

677
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,620
An incredible life.
Two dads that totally adore him.

678
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,590
And you to dress up as
Santa on Christmas morning.

679
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,460
[Fred laughs]

680
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,490
That's funny?

681
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:22,570
It's very sweet.

682
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:25,390
I want him to catch you eating cookies.

683
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,800
Eating cookies.

684
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,940
He loves sugar cookies!

685
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,360
You don't want to
get caught eating cookies.

686
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,340
Come on!!

687
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,150
You're going to do that to Santa?

688
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,140
Really?

689
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,820
A portable sling?

690
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,540
Fred, don't take a picture of that!

691
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,170
It'll look amazing on a mug!

692
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:45,010
- Number One Dad!
- For Christmas!

693
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:46,700
- You're my Santa.
- What?

694
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,860
You're my Santa.

695
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,940
You're my Mrs. Claus.

696
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:53,490
I love you, sweetheart.

697
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:54,800
I love you, baby.

698
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,570
Wrap it up, you two.

699
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,940
Otherwise you end up like this.
It's how it happens.

700
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,030
That's your sister.

701
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:03,020
And our baby mama.

702
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:03,960
True.

703
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,340
Let's give some head.

704
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,067
Shall we?

705
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:41,780
Damn!

706
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,150
What?

707
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,580
Gross.

708
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,830
All right, Vanna.

709
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:50,418
[Tyler] What?

710
00:34:57,539 --> 00:34:59,980
Look, he's a doctor!

711
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:01,620
Fancy.

712
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,650
Paging Dr. Wayne,
your 10:30 prostate exam...

713
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:06,600
[phone chimes]
He just unlocked his photos.

714
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,020
You are such a slut.

715
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,780
I don't know why
Jay puts up with you.

716
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,780
The open relationship
was his idea, remember?

717
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,160
I remember—you
don't do closets.

718
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,390
Wow. That makes me seem cold.

719
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:20,480
If the cock ring fits...
I'm kidding. I get it.

720
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,940
But he did move here for you.

721
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,860
He moved to the firehouse down
the street for all the time I see him

722
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,662
which is fine if I could visit,
but it's like I don't even exist.

723
00:35:27,902 --> 00:35:29,670
This same shit again?

724
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,700
Give the guy some time, he's old school.

725
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,000
And you're so new school.

726
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:33,950
Fired.

727
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,600
- You want a promotion?
- Yes, please!

728
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,660
Michael and Dalton
are here. I'll be back.

729
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,980
Speaking of daddy.

730
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:39,940
Hey, John Adam!

731
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,090
What's the deal with the EMT
posting I saw on the board?

732
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:44,710
You're not certified.

733
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,310
Get certified—the job is yours.

734
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,320
Really?

735
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,040
But do it quick, boy—
I don't need it at the end of the season.

736
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,290
Yes, sir!

737
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:55,210
Hey, what up, D?

738
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:56,670
- Tyler.
- What's up, buddy?

739
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:58,200
Good to see you, man.

740
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,390
Good to see you, too.

741
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,390
How's it goin'?

742
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,610
Eh...

743
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,050
I just talked to John Adam

744
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:06,350
and he said she's okay to come
to the screening but...

745
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,620
It's okay. We got a hotel
room down the road.

746
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,210
Perfect.

747
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,360
Why did you bring her here?

748
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,260
We didn't. She hid in the back.

749
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,450
Why?

750
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,960
She caught us facing
off over the jerky.

751
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,470
Shit.

752
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,000
He's still carrying it around?

753
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,110
Yeah.

754
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,630
Baby girl just wants
to protect her daddy.

755
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,750
I get it.

756
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:36,020
Really, she's just seen too many horror
movies about white folks in the woods.

757
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:40,100
Hey, D.

758
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,100
Just give him a little more time.

759
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,330
Yeah.

760
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,140
[Michael] Young man!

761
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,480
You better come over here and
give your Mama Bear some sugar.

762
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:52,390
Busted! Hi!

763
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:54,720
Oh! Ahh!

764
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,680
Now you're laughing.

765
00:36:58,930 --> 00:36:59,870
Who are you texting?

766
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,790
I'm Google mapping this place.

767
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,130
Just in case.

768
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:05,160
You're pretty crafty with that thing.

769
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,840
I already apologized in the car,

770
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,590
don't make me hack your email.

771
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:09,660
Heard.

772
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,480
Looks like everything is good now.

773
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,480
Yeah, Mama Bear's in full affect.

774
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,810
Come here, baby.

775
00:37:23,535 --> 00:37:24,535
Ahh!

776
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,830
Slide over.

777
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,690
Hi!

778
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:30,650
Emma.

779
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:32,830
Emma, that's a pretty name.

780
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,090
Thanks.

781
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,620
I'm Tyler.

782
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:40,300
Hi, Tyler Hall.

783
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,980
What's "Naked Bear Twister"?

784
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:42,990
What?

785
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,640
It was on the schedule for today.

786
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,290
Okay, we're done. Let's go.

787
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,140
Bye, Tyler Hall!

788
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,530
Bye, Kerry Washington!

789
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,040
Oh my god, I love her.

790
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,650
I knew you would.

791
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,300
How did she know my last name?

792
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,060
- Change your password.
- Excuse me?

793
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,340
[Dalton] Michael!

794
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,670
Daddy's calling.

795
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:04,680
Yeah!

796
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,060
Tell John Adam I'll call him later.

797
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:10,090
Okay. I'm just gonna sunbathe.

798
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,180
Ah! Silence.

799
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,440
Sorry, sir.

800
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,260
"Sir"? Don't call me sir, my dad is...

801
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,510
...sir.

802
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,720
[horn honks]

803
00:38:55,595 --> 00:38:58,595
[music blares from truck]

804
00:39:04,082 --> 00:39:05,132
[music stops]

805
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,030
[Tyler] Hi.

806
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:19,020
Hey.

807
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,360
You drove right past me.

808
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,560
You didn't say anything.

809
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,500
I screamed.

810
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,890
You didn't scream very loud.

811
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:24,830
Yes, I did.

812
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,070
No.

813
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,230
- Hi.
- Hi.

814
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:33,590
The sooner we get
this truck unloaded,

815
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:37,110
the sooner we can go inside
and get to business.

816
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,160
So get up there.

817
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,470
Say "fucker."

818
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,460
Get up there... fucker.

819
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,110
Yes, Chief!

820
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,670
You're almost done.

821
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:49,040
I'm just getting started.

822
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,070
How's training going?

823
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:53,670
It's going great.

824
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:55,600
I'm whippin' them into shape.

825
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:59,340
Of course, it's a firehouse so
it may as well be a frat house.

826
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,590
You know what I mean?

827
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,860
I don't. But I'd love to.

828
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:06,600
I know you would, Tyler.
I'd like that too.

829
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,870
[Tyler] But...

830
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,020
I'm tired, Tyler.

831
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:20,470
I'm tired, too.

832
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,910
And not just here.

833
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:39,330
Everywhere. In public, on the streets.

834
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:41,510
In front of your fireman buddies.

835
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,860
I just can't do that right now, Tyler.

836
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,700
I've got to think about my retirement.

837
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,260
Here we go.

838
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,760
You don't understand.

839
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,170
Technically, I still work for

840
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:52,130
the fire department in Texas.

841
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:54,180
Billy's only letting me work remotely here

842
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,950
so I can train his son.

843
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,880
And if his son wasn't here?

844
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,200
His son is here, Blanche.

845
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,620
He is here.

846
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,660
You say that shit in front of
your fireman buddies?

847
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,680
'Cause then they for sure know you're gay.

848
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,290
Just shut up, fucker...

849
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:14,100
...and take me to bed.

850
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,430
Yes, Chief.

851
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,940
Come with me.

852
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,000
I was gonna do summer stock,

853
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,720
but this is more fun.

854
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,600
Life choices, am I right?

855
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,280
Don't talk to me about life choices.

856
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:33,300
The other night

857
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,040
Tyler forgot his line

858
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,340
and then started laughing.

859
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:37,520
So I started laughing

860
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,390
but the audience totally loved it.

861
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,520
So we improvised half the show.

862
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:45,990
Michael would never let
you get away with that.

863
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,020
This ain't Broadway,

864
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,390
though some of these queens
would like to think it is.

865
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:51,640
But the owners are great

866
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,050
and don't care as long
as we get our jobs done.

867
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:56,350
Heyyy, Simon!

868
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,980
Ugh. Bears.

869
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,330
Oh my god! You should totally
come to the frat party weekend!

870
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:05,090
Me and Ty have some
totally awesome things planned!

871
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:06,390
How is Ty?

872
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,360
He's great!

873
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,460
Except he's totally all over any
dude that looks like Santa.

874
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,850
Wait—he's not with Jay anymore?

875
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:15,960
Oh no, he is.

876
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,360
Oh my god! I didn't tell you.

877
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,300
Oh my god! What?

878
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,240
I'm totally in love with someone!

879
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:21,370
Totally?

880
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:23,130
Is he totally awesome
and totally hot?

881
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:24,770
And totally cool?

882
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,630
Fuck you, bitch.

883
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:28,480
Totally!

884
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,190
How is Nate anyway?

885
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:33,640
Now that's a bear I could
flip to the dark side for.

886
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,070
Is he coming?

887
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:38,410
No, it's summer so he's in
Ptown for the season.

888
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:40,300
Oh, right—the dune tours.

889
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:43,330
I picked the right bachelor
party that weekend.

890
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:44,350
Hey!

891
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:47,030
A bonfire on the beach is way better
than a bonfire out here.

892
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,180
I just meant the sex
I had in the sauna,

893
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:53,620
over the dune... stuff... you guys... did.

894
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:56,340
I knew what you meant, Simon.

895
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,720
Where is Michael's?

896
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,470
It's this way.

897
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:02,320
[Tyler] Oh, shit!

898
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,640
Oh, fuck!

899
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:05,740
Ohh!

900
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,080
You like that, Chief?

901
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,040
The Chief loves it, Recruit!

902
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:25,950
Look at this thing!

903
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:27,590
Where are we gonna sleep?

904
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,630
Well! Hi!

905
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:34,320
[Roger] Hey, Ty.

906
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,320
Well, this is awkward.

907
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,480
Tyler!

908
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,300
Jay, it's okay—I've seen it all before.

909
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,270
How are you?

910
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:45,880
I've certainly been better.

911
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,800
Baby, are you okay?

912
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,360
I busted my tail bone.

913
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:55,870
Well! I guess no more
separate beds for you boys.

914
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:58,000
What? Look at it!

915
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,000
Separate beds?

916
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:03,200
I come in late a lot
from the firehouse...

917
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,690
Sorry to hear about Nate.

918
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,620
[Jay] What happened to Nate?

919
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:10,110
Nothing, just... summertime...

920
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:12,910
he spends his summers in
Ptown with the dune tours.

921
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:14,230
[Simon] Wow.

922
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:15,960
You guys really messed this up.

923
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,620
Hey! How about you do us a favor

924
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,930
and get us some pants, please.

925
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:31,200
Gross!

926
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,340
Shut up, boy, and get me my britches.

927
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,650
Okay, that was kind of hot.

928
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,810
I totally understand why this works now.

929
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:39,940
Size 50?

930
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,370
Yow!

931
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:42,770
Kidding.

932
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:47,670
You guys should
totally keep the slide

933
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,020
for Dalton's daughter.
She would love that!

934
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:50,980
Who?

935
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,110
Dalton's daughter.

936
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:54,000
She snuck in the back of their car

937
00:44:54,242 --> 00:44:55,940
and they didn't realize
'til they got here.

938
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,340
Is that where you're staying?

939
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:00,050
Michael's cabin, yeah.
They got a hotel down the road.

940
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:01,830
That's probably a good idea.

941
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:04,510
This is no place for children at night.

942
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:06,560
Spoken like a true straight man.

943
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,110
[Roger] I have to agree with him, Ty.

944
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:12,140
I don't. Europeans take their
children to nude beaches all the time.

945
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,220
Not in America they don't.

946
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:17,790
Well, he's the whole package, isn't he?

947
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:20,266
All right, fuckers!

948
00:45:20,506 --> 00:45:22,230
Tyler—fetch my gun.

949
00:45:23,523 --> 00:45:24,860
You brought your gun?

950
00:45:34,093 --> 00:45:37,316
Jay, John Adam said I could get
a better job if I get EMT certified.

951
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,730
Can you possibly help me with that?

952
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:43,680
Be here at 7am. We'll get started.

953
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:45,050
7am?

954
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:46,460
A.M.

955
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:50,730
Okay, fine, I'll be here at 7am.

956
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:53,020
Oh my god! What time is it?

957
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:55,030
We have to get ready for the glow party!

958
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:56,590
Oh my god! I'm not going.

959
00:45:56,830 --> 00:45:57,890
Glow party?

960
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,560
It's some party they do
down at the head shed.

961
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,610
You're more excited about
getting ready for Sebastian.

962
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:05,443
Oooh, yassss!!

963
00:46:05,683 --> 00:46:06,826
- See you bitches later!
- Bye.

964
00:46:07,076 --> 00:46:08,080
[phone beeping]

965
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,490
Dang it—another fire
over at old lady Haggerty's.

966
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:13,290
[Tyler] For real?
[Jay] Again!

967
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:16,490
Uh... don't worry...

968
00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:19,130
I'm sure Roger will help me clean this up.

969
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:21,460
Yeah. Sure.

970
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:27,730
Well, all right... well, thanks... boys.

971
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:36,480
[Jay] Where's my damn shirt?

972
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,615
[Jay] This is a mess!

973
00:46:37,865 --> 00:46:39,105
[clattering sounds]

974
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:45,170
Wait, your shirt's open.

975
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:47,980
Go get 'em!

976
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:49,080
Thanks again, Roger.

977
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,730
[Roger] Yeah, no worries.

978
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:56,780
[truck door slams]

979
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:58,640
[truck engine starts]

980
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:03,350
[truck drives away]

981
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,420
Should we get to work?

982
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,870
You don't have to stay.

983
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:11,016
This doesn't have to be weird, Tyler.

984
00:47:11,256 --> 00:47:13,233
We were in a relationship, we're friends.

985
00:47:13,473 --> 00:47:15,273
We've accomplished a lot together.

986
00:47:15,513 --> 00:47:16,700
And now...

987
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,460
we're gonna fix a pop-up.

988
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,000
Yes, we are.

989
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:26,240
Now, Fred having a kid?

990
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,740
That's weird. That's just silly.

991
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,700
- Come on.
- I'm just kidding.

992
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:32,770
They'll be great parents.

993
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,650
- Bed?
- Yeah.

994
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:37,970
[Roger] One, two, three!

995
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,780
See? I always knew we were a good team.

996
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,640
I thought this wasn't
gonna be weird.

997
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,480
- Speaking of weird...
- Roger.

998
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:46,820
Don't.

999
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:48,810
How do you know what I was gonna say?

1000
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:50,240
You want to go with that?

1001
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,000
He wouldn't even hold your hand.

1002
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:57,350
He's from Texas.

1003
00:47:57,590 --> 00:47:59,000
I don't know.

1004
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,240
Final answer?

1005
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,020
I hate you.

1006
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,410
No, you don't.

1007
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:11,720
Back to work?

1008
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:13,990
Fine.

1009
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,230
[Michael] Hey, boys!

1010
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:23,840
Back to pick you up later!

1011
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:45,990
[Michael] Oh, look! A deer!

1012
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:47,230
[Emma] Oh!

1013
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:03,910
[laughter] That's fantastic!

1014
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:13,380
Hi! Fancy meeting you here.

1015
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:14,400
Water diet?

1016
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,350
Mmm, hmm.

1017
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,670
It's so hot!

1018
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:22,710
- Well...
- I know, but I like this spot, usually.

1019
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:26,070
They keep this place so cold
for all these sweaty bears.

1020
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:27,740
We can go outside...

1021
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:29,240
Nah—I'm hot wherever I go.

1022
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:32,000
Ah!

1023
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,360
Here you go, ladies.

1024
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,480
That's Mrs. Richards-Dean.

1025
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:36,420
You're cute.

1026
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:38,440
Let me know if you
need anything else, Suzie.

1027
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,880
- Thank you, Flo.
- Look at all this meat.

1028
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,250
Try the fried pickles.

1029
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:43,750
I'm just gonna eat my feelings.

1030
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:44,810
Are you PMSing?

1031
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:46,530
Yes, I'm on the same cycle as you.

1032
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:50,630
- You don't even know what that means.
- I'm just a little nervous.

1033
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:53,160
There's no way you're
backing out now, mister.

1034
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,860
I don't mean that.
I'm not talking about that. C'mon.

1035
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:57,200
All right.

1036
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,050
Try the chicken wings. They're good.

1037
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:01,790
You're starting great dietary lessons.

1038
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:02,880
You're such a bitch.

1039
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,870
Good, nutritional choices.

1040
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:06,570
I'm hungry.

1041
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:08,590
How's my big brother? Is he nervous too?

1042
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:10,080
- No.
- Good.

1043
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,450
I guess.

1044
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:14,640
- What's going on Brent?
- What?

1045
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,500
- Spit it out.
- I've got nothing to hide.

1046
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:18,900
Can I get you anything else?

1047
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:20,220
Yeah—a vodka martini.

1048
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:21,170
Susan!

1049
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,400
It's for you, Mommy!

1050
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,740
No, thank you. I'm fine.

1051
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,900
Wonderful. Let me know if you
want anything we actually have.

1052
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:29,900
Sassy! I hate water.

1053
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:32,580
Kidding!

1054
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:36,390
You're stalling, and you're
so not subtle. Speak!

1055
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:38,280
Fine! Yes, hormones. I'll tell you.

1056
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:41,880
I just, I feel like I'm
alone in this thing.

1057
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,180
Right? I'm the only one
taking it seriously.

1058
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:45,610
Remember how into it he was?

1059
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:47,360
Of course. I mean obviously.

1060
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,750
I don't get knocked up for anyone.

1061
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:51,450
Well, there was that one time...

1062
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:52,420
Hey, focus.

1063
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:54,380
You focus! Brent,
what's this really about?

1064
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:57,220
Uh, sir, you're in a restaurant.

1065
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,010
This, that's the problem.

1066
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:00,450
Nothing wrong with that.

1067
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:02,580
Ugh! Gay people!

1068
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:03,850
Gay...

1069
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:05,220
...people.

1070
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,700
I don't...

1071
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,480
Maybe they shouldn't have kids.

1072
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,520
You stop it right there, okay?

1073
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:13,470
There's enough people who think
that way, Brent, and it's not true.

1074
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:16,206
Sure, gay people are
bonded by sexuality,

1075
00:51:16,446 --> 00:51:17,963
but they're also bonded by love.

1076
00:51:18,203 --> 00:51:20,870
And it's a love that's been
fought for and earned.

1077
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:23,760
If you don't think those are
values a child needs in this world,

1078
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,860
then you're as dumb as the people
who think you're not fit to raise him.

1079
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,610
Okay.

1080
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:33,000
Him? You said "him"!

1081
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:33,940
- Him?
- Her?

1082
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:34,880
- Her?
- What?

1083
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,320
- I don't know!
- Are you saying?

1084
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,760
- I can tell you right now.
- No.

1085
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,740
- It's a...
- Tell me. Don't.

1086
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:41,190
- Do not tell me.
- It is a...

1087
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:42,730
Cat.

1088
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:44,680
It's a cat?

1089
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:49,100
Thank you.

1090
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,690
You're welcome.

1091
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,400
Besides, straight people walk around
in their underwear like this, too,

1092
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,120
but they don't look as good doing it.

1093
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,940
Fred looks so good
in assless underwear.

1094
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:58,880
Atta girl.

1095
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:00,600
Eat!

1096
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:01,880
You're a fat pig.

1097
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:05,400
And proud of it.

1098
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:31,740
Dammit!

1099
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:35,840
I can't believe we didn't check
the gas gauge this whole time.

1100
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:38,510
You mean you can't believe I didn't.

1101
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:40,300
I did not say that.

1102
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,500
There's no cell service.

1103
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:43,510
Of course not.

1104
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:46,200
We're in the middle of nowhere!

1105
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:47,170
Honey!

1106
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:48,290
[Dalton] What?!

1107
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:51,180
Emma!

1108
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:53,430
Emma, wait.

1109
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:56,220
Wait.

1110
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:00,360
I'm sorry. I just...

1111
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,190
You just what?

1112
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:05,290
I just want us...

1113
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:07,020
Want us to what?

1114
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:10,250
Want us to be a happy little family?
Want me to call him "Dad"?

1115
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:14,540
Yes, eventually—that would be nice.

1116
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:18,800
Is he the one?
Daddy, is he really the one?

1117
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,280
Because he's carrying around
a dead man's jerky.

1118
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:27,000
Why is that funny?
In what world is that funny?

1119
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,770
He's choosing a piece
of dried meat over you.

1120
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:38,830
Look, I'm sorry I yelled.

1121
00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:40,740
I'm sorry.

1122
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,330
Whatever. I still don't trust him.

1123
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:46,680
This is just like in the
white people movies.

1124
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,230
We're stranded in the middle
of nowhere with him now.

1125
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:50,800
[Dalton] Come on.

1126
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:52,850
[Dalton] I love you.

1127
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:54,850
[Emma] I love you, too, Dad.

1128
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:56,690
[Dalton] Come on.

1129
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,790
I'm sorry.

1130
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:11,150
I didn't hear a word.

1131
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,680
I heard everything.

1132
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:13,980
I know.

1133
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,890
Maybe there's
some gas in the trunk.

1134
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:27,700
No gas.

1135
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:29,250
There is a tent.

1136
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:33,690
Whose ATV did you say this was?

1137
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:36,940
John Adam? Or Wayne? I don't know.

1138
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:39,720
What's this for?

1139
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,080
Gimme that. Nothing.

1140
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,680
Emma...

1141
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:46,110
How about you and I go find some firewood

1142
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:48,040
and Daddy can set up the tent?

1143
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:52,500
(Serious?)

1144
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,730
It's getting late—
what else can we do?

1145
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:56,780
[Michael] We got a
little bit of food, and

1146
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:59,470
who knows what else is in this ATV?

1147
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:00,710
Then what?

1148
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:02,800
Hope somebody
shows up tomorrow?

1149
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,320
(Baby!)

1150
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:09,680
Yes. It'll be fun.

1151
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,910
Trust me.

1152
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,690
I'll set up the tent

1153
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:17,510
and the two of you go have some fun.

1154
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:19,610
Bring back some wood.

1155
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:26,910
Gay people.

1156
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,560
[Tyler] Okay, wow,

1157
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,050
my chest and my nuts

1158
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:34,420
are literally roasting
on this open fire.

1159
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:37,720
I'm gonna go play flip cup.
This is boring. Bye!

1160
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:47,520
Eat some of these before they melt.

1161
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,290
If you put it that way.

1162
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:51,290
Those are Grape Apes...

1163
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:53,610
and these are Buttery Nipples.

1164
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,260
Now you're talking!

1165
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,280
Join us for a shot?

1166
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:00,170
No, I've had ten already, so...
but thank you.

1167
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:01,940
Suit yourself.

1168
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:05,160
Oh, wow, Jell-O shots!

1169
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,490
Shithead, why do you always do that?

1170
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:09,370
No glow party tonight?

1171
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:12,360
No glow party. I'm gonna go
have a date with a flip cup.

1172
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:19,100
He's cheating! You saw it?

1173
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:20,440
You're a cheater!

1174
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:21,900
He dropped it in the cup!

1175
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:23,860
I'm gonna take a celebrity shot.

1176
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,800
Yes! I'm in!

1177
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,460
Me, too.

1178
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,590
Both you boys drink.

1179
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:40,020
Who's next?!

1180
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:46,470
[Simon] This is amazing!

1181
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:50,900
Well, hello boys!

1182
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,200
This is the perfect job for you two.

1183
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,580
I know, right?

1184
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:55,870
Step right up.

1185
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:57,600
- Yes, please!
- I'm gonna pass.

1186
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,690
Come here, little boy, Santa's waiting.

1187
00:56:59,930 --> 00:57:01,170
Yes, officer.

1188
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:02,110
Ready?

1189
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:03,650
Born ready, Santa.

1190
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:08,600
That was fun, but I'm
gonna go find Sebastian.

1191
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:09,630
He's in back.

1192
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:10,710
Your turn, Brent.

1193
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:12,480
What's that?

1194
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:16,110
Hey, hey!

1195
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:17,800
I'm in uniform.

1196
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:22,910
You should see this place during
Illumination. It's awesome.

1197
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:24,150
I'll bet.

1198
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:26,960
Queens love their tea candles.

1199
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:29,470
Yes, they do.

1200
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:34,900
There's this guy who does
this whole mural with them.

1201
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:37,190
It's really beautiful.

1202
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,940
Being with you again
is really beautiful.

1203
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,430
Stop.

1204
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:51,570
Don't you ever... miss us, Ty?

1205
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:55,240
Yeah.

1206
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:59,100
Of course I do—you were my first love.

1207
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:03,580
Things are different now.

1208
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:06,930
We're on separate paths.

1209
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,490
I'm with Jay, you're with Nate.

1210
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:14,100
Maybe we're not on separate paths,

1211
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:18,110
maybe we just, I don't know—

1212
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:20,670
took a wrong turn somewhere.

1213
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:25,310
I'm happy here.

1214
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:26,810
Heyyyy!!

1215
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:29,180
Hi, boys!

1216
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:30,540
Heidi Ho!

1217
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:32,420
How you doin'?

1218
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:34,370
Quite the catch you got there.

1219
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:35,870
It's just my friend.

1220
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,270
Mmm, hmm.

1221
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,280
He is a little thin for Tyler.

1222
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:44,543
I'm "a little thin" for you.

1223
00:58:45,923 --> 00:58:47,303
That's what she said.

1224
00:58:47,543 --> 00:58:48,860
You know what they mean.

1225
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:52,890
No, I'm a little thin and you...
like them fluffier.

1226
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,510
"Fluffier" is the word you want to use?

1227
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:58,230
"Fluffy." That's how I like them?

1228
00:58:58,470 --> 00:59:00,160
So now I'm into plushie sex.

1229
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,230
This is freakin' awesome!

1230
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,870
Jackson Pollock sex party.

1231
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:35,280
Fred!

1232
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:36,720
Jimmy!

1233
00:59:38,665 --> 00:59:39,985
[Brent] Oh, no!

1234
00:59:41,397 --> 00:59:44,397
[all talking at once]

1235
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:47,820
- Where are your husbands?
- They're in the back.

1236
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:49,560
Are they spit roasting a munchkin?

1237
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,560
It doesn't matter,
let's do some of this.

1238
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,550
Jimmy, you are an artiste.

1239
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:55,510
Can I suck your highlighter?

1240
00:59:57,810 --> 00:59:58,570
Hey, babe.

1241
00:59:58,810 --> 00:59:59,750
Well, hi!

1242
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:01,090
Hold on a second.

1243
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,030
Yo, Smiffy—got this?

1244
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:25,420
You look great.

1245
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:28,040
Like a busted drag queen
on Sunday morning.

1246
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:28,990
Nah...

1247
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:34,800
Now you look like a busted
drag queen on Sunday morning.

1248
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:37,120
Glitter. Glitterally? I hate you.

1249
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:38,710
No, you don't.

1250
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:40,040
No, I don't.

1251
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,710
Sebastian!

1252
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:45,950
What?

1253
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:47,190
What are you doing?

1254
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:48,830
Just...

1255
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,710
...marking my territory.

1256
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,340
Really?

1257
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:54,800
I'm yours?

1258
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,100
Yep.

1259
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:58,550
Branded.

1260
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:23,930
[Brent] Fred!

1261
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:25,230
- Hey, Ben!
- Hey, Brent!

1262
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:26,480
Have you seen Fred?

1263
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:27,870
I have not seen Fred.

1264
01:01:28,806 --> 01:01:29,960
Would you like a drink?

1265
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:31,530
Yes, one of these, what is that?

1266
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:33,100
It's "Autumn Sunrise."

1267
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:34,730
Okay, Ortisha!

1268
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:37,020
Oh my god!

1269
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:38,090
Best party ever!

1270
01:01:38,330 --> 01:01:39,590
Did you eat a clown's ass?

1271
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:41,240
Did you blow Dr. Seuss?

1272
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,110
- Who?
- Oh, please.

1273
01:01:43,350 --> 01:01:44,390
Has anyone seen Fred?

1274
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:45,420
Can I get a drink?

1275
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,440
Warren, haven't you seen Fred recently?

1276
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,440
- Yeah, over at the...
- No, no, actually he wants a shot.

1277
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:51,920
Warren, where did you see him?

1278
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,640
- A shot right here...
- Whatever.

1279
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,510
...and I'll do a shot with you.

1280
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:01,200
Where?

1281
01:02:04,450 --> 01:02:06,260
Did I fall asleep?

1282
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:08,900
Yep.

1283
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:11,740
It's 'cause I'm that good.

1284
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:13,060
Yes, you are.

1285
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:16,000
But you had a good teacher.

1286
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,040
Hmm.

1287
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:21,010
We're all meeting before
the screening tomorrow...

1288
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:22,770
Tyler, I want to get back together.

1289
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:25,400
I wasn't that good.

1290
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:28,190
I'm serious.

1291
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:30,280
What about Nate?

1292
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:35,150
There is no Nate.

1293
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:39,400
I lost my job, lost my apartment.

1294
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,980
Nate left.

1295
01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:47,080
That's why you want
to get back together?

1296
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,890
I want to get back together
because I'm still in love with you.

1297
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:55,490
I'm in love with someone else.

1298
01:02:57,650 --> 01:03:00,190
And I gotta get back to him.

1299
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,190
I'll see you at the screening.

1300
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:17,630
Thank you for putting us in your movie.

1301
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,940
Yeah, thank you.

1302
01:03:22,045 --> 01:03:23,415
It was my honor.

1303
01:03:24,782 --> 01:03:26,112
I'm a bottom.

1304
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:28,160
What are you doing?

1305
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,760
I got some skills.

1306
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,870
Do you know what you just said?

1307
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:33,320
Yeah—I said "I'm a top."

1308
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:34,800
Did you teach him this?

1309
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,120
Did you teach him?

1310
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:38,610
See? He wants to be topped.

1311
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:39,850
Idiot.

1312
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:43,170
WOOF.

1313
01:03:43,410 --> 01:03:44,440
Woof!

1314
01:03:45,595 --> 01:03:46,725
GRRRRRRRRRRRR!

1315
01:03:48,177 --> 01:03:49,977
I want your stiff dick in my ass.

1316
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:53,080
What did I say?

1317
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:54,160
Nothin'.

1318
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,800
That means "that
guy's really hot," no?

1319
01:04:01,810 --> 01:04:02,970
Fred! What the fuck?

1320
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:04,240
What?

1321
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:07,160
We are having a baby.

1322
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:08,580
I know.

1323
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,600
In two weeks!

1324
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:11,900
I get it.

1325
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:14,640
No, you don't, or you wouldn't
be sitting around getting high.

1326
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:15,780
No offense.

1327
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:20,380
You are totally overreacting to this.

1328
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:22,760
No, you're not taking it seriously.

1329
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,390
What do you mean?

1330
01:04:26,265 --> 01:04:27,525
Dramaaa.

1331
01:04:29,007 --> 01:04:30,287
I can't even.

1332
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,970
You know what?

1333
01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:35,670
Fuck you.

1334
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:46,900
Well, hey there.

1335
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:48,270
Hey!

1336
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:49,910
Did you just get home?

1337
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:51,460
No, I've been home a while.

1338
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:52,660
- Hi.
- Hi.

1339
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:56,680
How did you know I was craving steaks?

1340
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:01,530
Well, I figured these two steaks needed
to be cooked before they ruined, and

1341
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:04,280
that you'd be along soon anyway.

1342
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:07,250
Well, I'm starving, so thank you.

1343
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:08,460
Good.

1344
01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:15,680
You smell like him.

1345
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:44,310
I never wanted this.

1346
01:05:46,370 --> 01:05:49,510
I know, Tyler. I know.

1347
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,380
So I reckon they broke up?

1348
01:05:58,340 --> 01:05:59,480
Yeah, umm...

1349
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:03,310
I guess they're on a...

1350
01:06:03,550 --> 01:06:06,380
...a break or something. I don't know.

1351
01:06:11,090 --> 01:06:13,210
Do you need a break?

1352
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:21,820
No, Jay, I don't need a break.

1353
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:26,870
I need a man who's...

1354
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,590
...not ashamed to be who he is.

1355
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:33,630
I need a man who's...

1356
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:37,250
...not afraid to
introduce me to his friends.

1357
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:40,680
I need a man who's not ashamed
to hold my hand in public.

1358
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:42,290
I'm trying, Tyler!

1359
01:06:42,530 --> 01:06:44,850
I just don't want to
jeopardize my retirement.

1360
01:06:45,090 --> 01:06:47,610
"My retirement." I know, Jay.
I heard you, but...

1361
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:50,740
What's next? Huh?

1362
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:54,270
What's the next excuse, Jay?

1363
01:06:57,110 --> 01:06:59,450
Either you love me...

1364
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:02,930
...and you want the world to know it.

1365
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,560
Or you don't.

1366
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,620
It's just not that simple.

1367
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:10,700
Yes, it is!

1368
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:12,320
No, it's not, Tyler!

1369
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,530
I've been in the closet longer
than you've been alive!

1370
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:19,800
It's not so simple to go up
to people and say:

1371
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:21,722
"Oh, you know this guy you think I am?"

1372
01:07:21,962 --> 01:07:22,754
"That's not me."

1373
01:07:22,994 --> 01:07:24,986
"I've been lying to you the whole time."

1374
01:07:25,226 --> 01:07:27,570
I get it, Jay. I get it. But...

1375
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:31,790
I dropped my life.

1376
01:07:32,030 --> 01:07:33,900
I gave up everything.

1377
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:35,590
And I thought that moving up here

1378
01:07:35,830 --> 01:07:38,440
was gonna change your perspective.

1379
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,140
It has changed!

1380
01:07:42,070 --> 01:07:45,490
But if Jesse knows, then Billy knows.

1381
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:48,030
Billy—my best friend for

1382
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:50,250
as long as I can remember.

1383
01:07:50,490 --> 01:07:52,410
The friend who has his career

1384
01:07:52,650 --> 01:07:55,360
and retirement on the line...

1385
01:07:55,930 --> 01:07:58,490
...saying that I still work in Texas.

1386
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:05,610
Look: when I retire,

1387
01:08:05,850 --> 01:08:08,360
he can stop lying for me.

1388
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,980
And I guess I can stop lying to him.

1389
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:14,990
You guess? Jay?

1390
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:18,520
If Billy is your best friend,

1391
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:21,479
he's gonna understand.

1392
01:08:21,719 --> 01:08:22,629
That's it!

1393
01:08:22,868 --> 01:08:24,830
And if he understands,
then his son understands.

1394
01:08:25,069 --> 01:08:26,300
Period.

1395
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:29,578
You don't know Texans.

1396
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:31,459
[steak sizzles]

1397
01:08:35,738 --> 01:08:36,738
What?

1398
01:08:37,569 --> 01:08:39,689
You did that for effect.

1399
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:40,840
Did what?

1400
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:43,219
You flip a steak and say
"you don't know Texas"?

1401
01:08:43,459 --> 01:08:44,358
They were burning.

1402
01:08:44,598 --> 01:08:45,810
Were they?

1403
01:08:46,050 --> 01:08:47,149
Yeah.

1404
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:52,779
Just shut up and kiss me, please?

1405
01:09:03,729 --> 01:09:05,939
I love you, Jay.

1406
01:09:08,368 --> 01:09:11,509
I love you, Tyler.

1407
01:09:17,609 --> 01:09:19,850
You're burning the steak.

1408
01:09:25,410 --> 01:09:26,430
Well,

1409
01:09:27,149 --> 01:09:28,670
she finally fell asleep.

1410
01:09:29,859 --> 01:09:30,799
Good.

1411
01:09:32,469 --> 01:09:34,080
She was exhausted.

1412
01:09:34,319 --> 01:09:36,118
How are you holding up?

1413
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:37,990
Tired.

1414
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:40,323
Go to bed.

1415
01:09:40,563 --> 01:09:41,595
I'll stand watch.

1416
01:09:41,836 --> 01:09:43,015
We don't have to stand watch.

1417
01:09:43,256 --> 01:09:45,060
We're not camping in the Bronx.

1418
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:47,999
Hey! I grew up in the Bronx, mister.

1419
01:09:51,099 --> 01:09:52,960
She's very protective.

1420
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,940
She's very sweet.

1421
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,160
Like her daddy.

1422
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:06,930
Thank you for everything today.

1423
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:09,590
I love you.

1424
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,790
I love you too, D.

1425
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:23,280
So...

1426
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:26,450
what now?

1427
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:30,230
Well, with all those
crazy toys in that ATV

1428
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:34,420
I'd say we could have a rip-roaring night.

1429
01:10:35,090 --> 01:10:36,020
But...

1430
01:10:37,290 --> 01:10:40,250
...we'd scar her for life.

1431
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:43,110
We'd scar her for life.

1432
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:50,600
Oh!

1433
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:54,510
I know exactly what this party needs.

1434
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:02,890
Oh! What was that?

1435
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:04,580
You'll see.

1436
01:11:10,510 --> 01:11:12,680
That's real gay.

1437
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,220
Yep.

1438
01:11:17,870 --> 01:11:21,410
[music plays]
No, that's real gay.

1439
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:28,180
May I have this dance?

1440
01:11:30,610 --> 01:11:31,960
Please.

1441
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:55,060
Oh! I saw one!

1442
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:56,060
No, you didn't.

1443
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:57,050
Yes, I did!

1444
01:11:57,290 --> 01:11:59,600
That's the weed talking.
Do you even call it "weed"?

1445
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,130
Actually this stuff is
called "Purple Sticky Punch."

1446
01:12:02,370 --> 01:12:03,750
You've got to be kidding me.

1447
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:05,280
Nope.

1448
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:06,910
I saw another one!

1449
01:12:07,150 --> 01:12:08,990
Yeah, you did—that time.

1450
01:12:09,230 --> 01:12:10,410
I saw one before, too!

1451
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:11,660
- No.
- I did!

1452
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:14,230
We're all grown up now,
mister. I'm wise to you.

1453
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:16,630
I should probably pay you back
someday, shouldn't I?

1454
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:17,590
Ya think?

1455
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:19,680
I'm holding this baby
hostage until you do.

1456
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,220
Double or nothing?

1457
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:23,900
I don't think betting your
baby on a shooting star

1458
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:26,280
is on the list of good
fatherly things to do.

1459
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:30,850
Aww! I totally would have won.

1460
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:32,300
You already did.

1461
01:12:33,170 --> 01:12:34,620
You're having twins.

1462
01:12:35,450 --> 01:12:36,430
What?!

1463
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:40,120
Oh, my god!

1464
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:42,140
That is not funny!

1465
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:43,260
It was, actually!

1466
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:45,830
Suzie, you scared the shit out of me!

1467
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:54,570
Hello? Pregnant woman.

1468
01:12:54,810 --> 01:12:56,690
It's not even smoke—it's vapor.

1469
01:12:56,970 --> 01:12:59,220
You've got plenty of time to
fuck up this kid's future

1470
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:00,860
let me at least give birth first.

1471
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:02,840
Do you really think
we'll fuck him up?

1472
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:05,200
Oh, my god! Are you guys
mainlining estrogen?

1473
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,840
- You're killing me, both of you.
- What did he say to you?

1474
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:09,920
I'm supposed to be the
hot mess, not you two.

1475
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:12,870
- All right girl, you are a hot mess, okay?
- That's better.

1476
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:16,010
Make a wish.

1477
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:18,220
It already came true.

1478
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:20,170
Do yourself a favor and tell him that.

1479
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:23,050
I will.

1480
01:13:23,290 --> 01:13:24,220
Thank you, sis.

1481
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:25,760
You're welcome, Fat Freddie.

1482
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,330
No! Ahh, ha, ha!

1483
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:29,800
You're gonna damage the baby!

1484
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:32,400
Ahh! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!

1485
01:13:41,870 --> 01:13:44,760
[Michael snores]

1486
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:47,080
[growl]

1487
01:13:53,870 --> 01:13:55,370
We have to get Emma.

1488
01:13:58,070 --> 01:13:59,350
Come here!

1489
01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:00,960
Don't move, okay?

1490
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:02,200
Don't. Move.

1491
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:03,220
I'm scared, Dad!

1492
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:04,640
I know. It's okay.

1493
01:14:04,970 --> 01:14:06,400
It's okay, Daddy's here.

1494
01:14:09,690 --> 01:14:10,700
Not now.

1495
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:12,070
It's beautiful.

1496
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:14,000
Michael—quiet!

1497
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:25,120
Don't leave me!

1498
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,240
Shhh!

1499
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:27,560
I'm not leaving.

1500
01:14:31,170 --> 01:14:32,410
I got you.

1501
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:38,120
Oh, no.

1502
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:41,590
I'm scared, Dad!

1503
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:48,490
[grrrr]

1504
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:15,240
[grrrr]

1505
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:28,780
[ROAR]

1506
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:30,570
Gaaaahhhh!!!

1507
01:15:30,810 --> 01:15:31,560
[grrrr?]

1508
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,390
Yaaaahhhhh!

1509
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:34,370
[grrr]

1510
01:15:35,570 --> 01:15:36,760
[grunts]

1511
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:38,720
Yeah!!

1512
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:41,240
[Emma screams]

1513
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:50,140
[text message tone]

1514
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:02,760
Shit.

1515
01:16:07,510 --> 01:16:08,560
Dammit.

1516
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:15,670
We gotta move—now!

1517
01:16:15,910 --> 01:16:17,160
Yeah, okay.

1518
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:18,700
Oww!!

1519
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:19,760
What's wrong?

1520
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,930
I think my knee went out!

1521
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:25,620
It's okay—let's make it
to the ATV, come on!

1522
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:29,590
I don't think I can do this.

1523
01:16:29,830 --> 01:16:31,430
- What?!
- You have to go on without me.

1524
01:16:31,670 --> 01:16:33,110
We're not leaving you, Michael!

1525
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:34,110
I got an idea.

1526
01:16:34,350 --> 01:16:36,030
Emma—get him behind the wheel.

1527
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:38,990
You can do it, baby!

1528
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:50,330
- Dad, what are you doing?
- We're gonna tow him.

1529
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:54,020
No, it's too heavy!
I'm too heavy!

1530
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:56,930
- It's all downhill, just ride the brake!
- How do you know?

1531
01:16:57,170 --> 01:16:59,796
I Google mapped the woods!
It will take us all the way down.

1532
01:17:00,043 --> 01:17:01,740
- Trust me, Dad.
- I trust you.

1533
01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:07,850
- She did good!
- Not now, you two.

1534
01:17:08,860 --> 01:17:10,080
God, you guys are gay.

1535
01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:11,900
She was awake.

1536
01:17:19,450 --> 01:17:21,140
What the hell happened to you?

1537
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:22,730
Purple Mind Erasers.

1538
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:24,780
And this shit does not come off with soap.

1539
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:26,050
What, glitter?

1540
01:17:26,290 --> 01:17:27,920
Glitter never comes off, Mr. Chief Man.

1541
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:29,390
I meant the paint.

1542
01:17:29,630 --> 01:17:31,520
Good morning!

1543
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,260
Damn!

1544
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:35,330
You look like a busted ass drag queen.

1545
01:17:35,570 --> 01:17:37,200
That's what I was going for, honey.

1546
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:38,510
I'm gonna hit the showers,

1547
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:40,590
then help the guys
set up for tonight.

1548
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:42,900
All right. I'll see you after volleyball.

1549
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:45,680
- Have fun.
- Bye.

1550
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:48,470
You... play volleyball?

1551
01:17:48,710 --> 01:17:50,150
Of course! It helps clear my mind.

1552
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:52,500
How did I not know this?

1553
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:55,800
I don't know. We got a lot of work to do.

1554
01:18:00,170 --> 01:18:01,160
Put one hand here...

1555
01:18:02,675 --> 01:18:03,895
Use your whole back.

1556
01:18:05,350 --> 01:18:06,580
What are you doing?!

1557
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:15,210
I got this.

1558
01:18:15,450 --> 01:18:16,890
You just pull the pencil right out!

1559
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:19,000
- Oh, my...
- Don't...

1560
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:21,140
- Oww!
- You wrap it in place!

1561
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:23,270
Don't pull nothin'!

1562
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:27,040
And it ain't gonna move.

1563
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,650
This is a 5 milliliter bag.

1564
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:33,010
Turn it down.

1565
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:34,880
Squeeze it a couple times.

1566
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:36,840
Just ease out.

1567
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:39,050
Support the head as the baby comes out.

1568
01:18:39,290 --> 01:18:40,880
You're doing good.

1569
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:42,390
Yeah. Uh...

1570
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:47,520
Look, things happen.

1571
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:53,810
Nut sack.

1572
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:55,750
I'm so full!

1573
01:18:57,260 --> 01:18:58,140
Daddy!

1574
01:18:58,380 --> 01:18:59,636
Who's a good boy?

1575
01:19:00,866 --> 01:19:04,013
Who's a good boy?

1576
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:06,770
You are! You are!

1577
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:11,860
- Don't wrap over the wound.
- Right.

1578
01:19:13,591 --> 01:19:15,021
Just don't ever look down at it...

1579
01:19:15,621 --> 01:19:16,502
...like that.

1580
01:19:17,761 --> 01:19:18,852
(F this job.)

1581
01:19:19,422 --> 01:19:20,782
(I want to fuck you.)

1582
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:25,780
Put that down. Put your
hands in a fist. Around me.

1583
01:19:26,186 --> 01:19:28,613
Don't say they don't reach.
I'm not that fat!

1584
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:31,360
You gotta make a ball.

1585
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:33,480
Well now, you gotta get lower.

1586
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:35,200
Yeah, that's right.

1587
01:19:38,370 --> 01:19:40,380
Your scruff feels so good.

1588
01:19:41,015 --> 01:19:41,775
Ahem.

1589
01:19:42,137 --> 01:19:43,277
What? Do you want...

1590
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:49,680
...this guy, push here...

1591
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:50,990
and twist it...

1592
01:19:51,730 --> 01:19:52,870
squish it...

1593
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:56,530
- Yeah, that's good.
- Is that it?

1594
01:19:56,770 --> 01:19:57,550
- Yeah.
- I got it?

1595
01:19:57,790 --> 01:19:58,670
You did good.

1596
01:19:58,940 --> 01:19:59,880
Aww!

1597
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:02,810
No.

1598
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:04,810
Pick up your hand.

1599
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:06,980
In a fist.

1600
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:09,536
- Pound it!
- Oh.

1601
01:20:09,783 --> 01:20:11,000
- Again?
- Okay.

1602
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:13,490
And if you're really good,
when you pound...

1603
01:20:13,730 --> 01:20:15,040
Explode!

1604
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:18,000
Wow! That's fun!

1605
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:20,280
Learn something new every day.

1606
01:20:25,050 --> 01:20:27,240
[Gladys] Cheeseburger, medium-well!

1607
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:30,110
[Gladys] Hot dogs and
hamburgers, that's it, buddy.

1608
01:20:30,350 --> 01:20:31,240
You got french fries?

1609
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:34,440
There's no fuckin' french fries. Where
do you think you are, the Hilton?

1610
01:20:34,770 --> 01:20:37,250
[Gladys] Enjoy your day!
Enjoy your fuckin' hot dogs, bitches!

1611
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,890
[Gladys] Next restaurant?
Thirty miles away.

1612
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:45,700
Yo, buddy! You owe me $7
for the fuckin' cheeseburger!

1613
01:20:45,940 --> 01:20:47,790
Oh! God, shit... sorry!

1614
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,390
[Frank] Good luck, man. See you guys!

1615
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:24,070
Hey, Roger.

1616
01:21:24,310 --> 01:21:25,270
Jay.

1617
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:26,970
Didn't know you played.

1618
01:21:27,210 --> 01:21:29,110
Oh, yeah—really gets
the blood flowing.

1619
01:21:29,350 --> 01:21:30,260
Yes, it does!

1620
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:31,490
Where's Ty?

1621
01:21:31,730 --> 01:21:33,640
He's working around here somewhere.

1622
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:35,330
I bet.

1623
01:21:35,570 --> 01:21:36,670
Okay, I'm in—let's go!

1624
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,050
Up! Over!

1625
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:57,040
That's yours, boy!

1626
01:21:57,430 --> 01:21:58,200
Yes!

1627
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:12,680
You got it!

1628
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:13,870
Dammit!

1629
01:22:14,110 --> 01:22:15,840
Oh! How you like that?

1630
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,080
All right, guys, the next one's ours!

1631
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:23,420
I wouldn't be so sure, big man.

1632
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:54,920
- You all right?
- You okay?

1633
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:56,260
Come on! He's fine!

1634
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:58,920
- What's your problem?
- There was no power behind that, man.

1635
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:01,500
Take it easy, Roger, we're
just trying to have a good time.

1636
01:23:03,590 --> 01:23:05,990
Hey, it's okay. I'm okay.

1637
01:23:06,230 --> 01:23:07,830
See? He's okay.

1638
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:09,840
I'm gonna take five.

1639
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,070
[Ted] Shake it off.

1640
01:23:11,310 --> 01:23:13,910
Yeah, take five, you'll be fine, Jay.
Sorry about that!

1641
01:23:15,930 --> 01:23:16,930
What? I said I'm sorry!

1642
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:18,100
[Roger] Let's go!

1643
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:24,470
- Ready for it?
- Okay.

1644
01:23:24,850 --> 01:23:25,600
Goin' up.

1645
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,240
- Goin' up...
- Looking good.

1646
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:28,370
...goin' down.

1647
01:23:28,610 --> 01:23:29,580
Max, help me.

1648
01:23:29,820 --> 01:23:31,190
Okay, we got it.

1649
01:23:31,610 --> 01:23:32,760
Ugh!

1650
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:34,646
Wait—

1651
01:23:34,886 --> 01:23:35,773
it's upside down.

1652
01:23:36,193 --> 01:23:37,280
[Max] One more try.

1653
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:38,860
Here we go.

1654
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:40,750
[Fred] Jesus, you guys,
get it together.

1655
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:43,480
[Tyler] It takes a village.
[Max] Here we are.

1656
01:23:45,030 --> 01:23:47,840
- You think this thing is big enough?
- I've never had any complaints.

1657
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:50,980
- Damn! You stole my line, Max!
- Not quick enough, Ty.

1658
01:23:51,220 --> 01:23:53,900
- It's not right—it's too small.
- Why are you stressing?

1659
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:56,320
- Because everything has to be perfect!
- It will be!

1660
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:59,350
Look at the directions—
it's not even in English.

1661
01:24:00,730 --> 01:24:03,150
Oh, no you did not!

1662
01:24:03,390 --> 01:24:05,680
Great. Very funny.
Let's concentrate please?

1663
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:08,120
It says here that we need to spike the...

1664
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:10,130
...screen into the ground. Exactly.

1665
01:24:10,370 --> 01:24:11,920
Now get to work.

1666
01:24:13,110 --> 01:24:14,110
Thank you.

1667
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:17,400
Seriously—thank you.

1668
01:24:19,550 --> 01:24:21,040
All right, let's do this.

1669
01:24:33,170 --> 01:24:35,080
You need help with that spike?

1670
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:36,230
No.

1671
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:39,480
But I sure could use a frosty lemonade.

1672
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:41,170
Let me get that for you, sir.

1673
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:44,050
I'm just a young,
upper middle class waitress.

1674
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:45,970
Oh, that's nice!

1675
01:24:46,210 --> 01:24:47,570
I'm just a sweaty carnie

1676
01:24:47,810 --> 01:24:49,190
putting up the tent.

1677
01:24:49,430 --> 01:24:50,790
I'm gonna wet your t-shirt.

1678
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:52,510
Ooh, yeah, girl!

1679
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:54,200
Spread it all over me!

1680
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:55,560
[laughter]

1681
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,290
You two are crazy.

1682
01:24:57,530 --> 01:24:59,450
No, that's just their everyday life.

1683
01:24:59,690 --> 01:25:01,410
Okay, it is hot as hell out here.

1684
01:25:01,650 --> 01:25:04,500
I'm gonna give you two a minute
and go check out the pool.

1685
01:25:04,740 --> 01:25:06,000
- Come on, Tyler.
- Why?

1686
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:08,440
[Max] Give them a minute, fool! Come on!

1687
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:10,270
Hammer?

1688
01:25:10,510 --> 01:25:11,370
Hammertime!

1689
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:14,860
You're fired!

1690
01:25:15,490 --> 01:25:18,020
What is this? I'm a producer,
I don't have to use this.

1691
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:19,760
I'm sorry, sweetie, about before.

1692
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,170
I didn't mean to make
you feel all alone in this.

1693
01:25:23,770 --> 01:25:24,710
I'm sorry, too.

1694
01:25:24,950 --> 01:25:26,220
I can be a little...

1695
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:27,560
- What?
- I don't know...

1696
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:31,570
maybe sometimes I'm not
perfect. I can be, maybe, even...

1697
01:25:31,870 --> 01:25:34,310
imperfect, I... what's the
word I'm looking for?

1698
01:25:34,550 --> 01:25:37,130
I'm not falling for that. Not doing it.

1699
01:25:37,530 --> 01:25:39,710
- I love you, Gobo.
- I love you too, Wembley.

1700
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:42,650
How's this work? What are we doing?

1701
01:25:42,890 --> 01:25:45,053
We are pounding stakes—boom, boom, boom.

1702
01:25:45,293 --> 01:25:47,756
- Every one of these.
- Is this thing big enough?

1703
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,930
Well, I've never had any complaints.

1704
01:25:50,170 --> 01:25:50,920
Really?

1705
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:51,920
Nope.

1706
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:54,030
Get to work.

1707
01:25:54,270 --> 01:25:55,660
[Simon] Hello, boys!
- Oh, hey!

1708
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:57,160
- Hi.
- What are we doing?

1709
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:59,060
We're blowing up this big bouncy castle.

1710
01:25:59,300 --> 01:26:02,720
Squee! Oh my god, I love bouncy castles!

1711
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:04,070
Do we have any more molly?

1712
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:05,070
Yeah, but...

1713
01:26:05,310 --> 01:26:07,260
I don't think that's
a bouncy castle, babe.

1714
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:08,870
Wait—you guys have molly?

1715
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:11,770
Oh my god, Brent, we should
totally watch the movie trippin'!

1716
01:26:12,010 --> 01:26:14,220
I can't believe you, Fred!!

1717
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:16,070
- What?
- Get the fuck out of here!

1718
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:18,810
What did I do now?

1719
01:26:19,050 --> 01:26:20,246
We are having...

1720
01:26:20,486 --> 01:26:21,593
a baby!

1721
01:26:21,943 --> 01:26:23,005
Not tonight we're not!

1722
01:26:23,245 --> 01:26:24,157
This is my night!

1723
01:26:24,397 --> 01:26:25,530
Who'd you say?

1724
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:27,440
I mean this is our night.

1725
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:29,630
I think you had it right the first time.

1726
01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:32,550
It's fine! It's your night,
it's your night.

1727
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:34,320
I didn't mean it that way.

1728
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:35,720
What's wrong with you?

1729
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:38,600
Why can't you just enjoy what
we've accomplished together?

1730
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:41,190
I'm up to my ass in debt
because of your accomplishments.

1731
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:42,240
Fuck you.

1732
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:45,450
It's really expensive to have a baby,
and you seem to think we're ready.

1733
01:26:45,690 --> 01:26:47,960
No one's ever ready. You
think straight people are ready?

1734
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:50,730
Half the time they don't see it
coming, which is probably better

1735
01:26:50,970 --> 01:26:53,490
so they don't have to deal with
the constant nagging for a year

1736
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:56,490
only to have it continue for
another nine fucking months!

1737
01:26:59,960 --> 01:27:00,820
Well.

1738
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:04,420
Enjoy your night, because you earned it.

1739
01:27:07,050 --> 01:27:08,130
Oh, great.

1740
01:27:08,450 --> 01:27:09,180
That's great!

1741
01:27:09,420 --> 01:27:11,623
You're just gonna walk away?

1742
01:27:11,863 --> 01:27:13,226
And you're worried about me?

1743
01:27:13,466 --> 01:27:16,090
At least I wouldn't walk out on the kid!

1744
01:27:22,130 --> 01:27:22,860
Oh, shit.

1745
01:27:23,980 --> 01:27:25,760
- Well, that went well.
- Max!

1746
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:26,760
Sorry.

1747
01:27:27,490 --> 01:27:29,300
Don't worry about it, Fred,
he'll walk it off.

1748
01:27:29,540 --> 01:27:31,960
I don't think he will.
Why would you say that?

1749
01:27:32,200 --> 01:27:33,660
I don't know, Ty.

1750
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:35,900
Maybe I'm scared, too.

1751
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:37,880
I wasn't talking
about taking heroin,

1752
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:40,100
I was talking about
ecstasy. Jesus Christ!

1753
01:27:40,340 --> 01:27:41,650
We have ecstasy?

1754
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:43,020
Really?

1755
01:27:43,410 --> 01:27:45,840
Guys, can we just get this
show on the road?

1756
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:48,000
We've got to get this
together for tonight.

1757
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:49,140
No.

1758
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:51,200
I'm gonna see how he's doing.

1759
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:52,690
What is wrong with you?

1760
01:27:53,470 --> 01:27:55,330
I don't know what to do, Max.

1761
01:27:55,570 --> 01:27:56,800
I love him so much, and yet

1762
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,190
everything I do just
seems to disappoint him.

1763
01:27:59,570 --> 01:28:00,953
That's just not true.

1764
01:28:01,193 --> 01:28:02,283
He is very proud of you,

1765
01:28:02,523 --> 01:28:03,656
and he's proud of the film,

1766
01:28:03,896 --> 01:28:06,100
and he's so happy to be
starting a family with you.

1767
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:08,263
He's just being...

1768
01:28:08,503 --> 01:28:09,536
you know...

1769
01:28:09,776 --> 01:28:10,880
Brent.

1770
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:16,176
Maybe he's right.

1771
01:28:16,416 --> 01:28:18,983
Maybe I am being selfish
and self-centered with all this.

1772
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:20,950
I am the wrong guy
to talk to about that.

1773
01:28:21,190 --> 01:28:22,880
- Yeah, that's true.
- Wait... what?

1774
01:28:23,230 --> 01:28:24,020
Yo, guys.

1775
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:25,440
Hey, where is everybody?

1776
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:27,760
Michael was supposed to
meet me at the cafe,

1777
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:31,300
and then I thought Dalton was gonna
help you here. Have you heard from them?

1778
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:32,470
No.

1779
01:28:32,710 --> 01:28:35,090
I guess we are on our own.

1780
01:28:35,330 --> 01:28:37,220
All right, well... I'll be back later.

1781
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:39,126
Good luck! Looking forward to it.

1782
01:28:39,373 --> 01:28:40,600
Thanks, man.

1783
01:28:45,910 --> 01:28:47,890
[Brent] Out of curiosity,
how much do you pay

1784
01:28:48,130 --> 01:28:49,490
Simon and Tyler to do nothing?

1785
01:28:49,730 --> 01:28:51,070
Don't get me started.

1786
01:28:51,310 --> 01:28:53,450
You all right carrying
that in your condition?

1787
01:28:53,690 --> 01:28:55,090
My back hurts, but I'll live.

1788
01:28:56,030 --> 01:28:56,920
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.

1789
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:57,870
Hey.

1790
01:28:58,210 --> 01:28:59,590
Enjoying the retention pond?

1791
01:28:59,830 --> 01:29:00,600
Beautiful.

1792
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:03,180
That's where your water comes from.

1793
01:29:03,730 --> 01:29:06,130
I am concerned about you...
and Fred, all right?

1794
01:29:06,370 --> 01:29:08,090
You're not sticking me with this baby.

1795
01:29:08,330 --> 01:29:09,800
That's a horrible thing to say!

1796
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:12,030
Seriously! This was your idea.

1797
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:14,120
You two gotta get your shit together.

1798
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:17,020
I've got my shit together—it's
your brother. He's the one that

1799
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:19,700
dropped ecstasy right before
you're about to drop the baby.

1800
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:21,330
That's not about to happen...

1801
01:29:21,570 --> 01:29:22,540
Ahh!!!

1802
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:24,410
Okay!

1803
01:29:24,650 --> 01:29:25,670
Ah, okay!

1804
01:29:25,910 --> 01:29:28,310
She needs a doctor!

1805
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:30,680
- You're so easy!
- Oh, my god. Stop.

1806
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:33,120
That's your idea of comedy? Not funny.

1807
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:35,720
Take a towel—don't chap
your ass on the trees.

1808
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:37,210
You should've seen your face!

1809
01:29:37,450 --> 01:29:40,040
I don't know why I married
into this family—you're evil.

1810
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:41,800
You'll make such a good mom.

1811
01:29:42,040 --> 01:29:45,120
- I'm not talking to you any more.
- C'mon, I'm just playing around.

1812
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:48,040
You'll know when I'm gonna
have the baby—I'll drop my water

1813
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:50,640
- on your lesbian sandals.
- These are not Birkenstocks!

1814
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,970
They say Birkenstocks, but
they are not Birkenstocks.

1815
01:29:54,930 --> 01:29:56,050
[water splashes]

1816
01:30:00,030 --> 01:30:01,240
Are you not wearing underwear?

1817
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:04,200
- That's important right now?
- Did your water just break?

1818
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:07,760
- What are you doing here?
- I heard you and Fred so I followed you.

1819
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,520
- You're stalking us?!
- I'm trying to protect you guys.

1820
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:12,230
Are you two fucking serious?!

1821
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:15,310
- Can you call Jay?
- No, he's too far away.

1822
01:30:15,640 --> 01:30:17,460
- Hold on, I got it.
- What?

1823
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:19,030
[phone chimes]
Is that GROWLr?!

1824
01:30:19,270 --> 01:30:20,350
My friend's a doctor.

1825
01:30:21,290 --> 01:30:23,040
- Do you need help?
- Are you a doctor?

1826
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:24,160
I'm a programmer.

1827
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:26,184
Great! Let's get drunk
and play video games.

1828
01:30:26,610 --> 01:30:29,180
Focus! Does anyone
know how to deliver a baby?

1829
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:30,900
I can deliver a baby!

1830
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:32,460
[Susan] Yeah?
[Brent] What?!

1831
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:34,480
My friend's on the way. He's a doctor.

1832
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:36,360
We don't need another Santa here, Tyler!

1833
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:37,600
It's Wayne!

1834
01:30:37,940 --> 01:30:39,360
Do you bus them in?!

1835
01:30:40,330 --> 01:30:41,670
Guys! I can deliver a baby!

1836
01:30:41,910 --> 01:30:44,190
Simon, my friend's an actual doctor.

1837
01:30:44,430 --> 01:30:46,610
Why won't you listen to him?
He can deliver the baby!

1838
01:30:46,850 --> 01:30:49,400
I know you guys are a thing but
I've known Simon a long time...

1839
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:50,690
- and he can't...
- Ahh!!

1840
01:30:50,930 --> 01:30:52,380
Simon, are you sure?

1841
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:55,600
Yes! Please, trust me!
I won't let you down!

1842
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:57,330
I can do this!

1843
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:01,620
Okay, Simon, what do we do?

1844
01:31:04,050 --> 01:31:05,200
Sanitize that sling!

1845
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:06,630
[Brent] What?!
[Tyler] No!

1846
01:31:06,870 --> 01:31:09,020
[Fred] We were filming in
a disgusting bath house.

1847
01:31:09,970 --> 01:31:11,620
It sounds like it took a long time.

1848
01:31:11,860 --> 01:31:13,390
Yeah, and it was ridiculously hot.

1849
01:31:13,630 --> 01:31:14,330
I'll bet.

1850
01:31:14,570 --> 01:31:16,600
For those of you just
joining the live podcast,

1851
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:18,980
and live, Fred, so don't
say anything you'll regret.

1852
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:20,330
I do that all the time.

1853
01:31:20,570 --> 01:31:21,490
Can I borrow him?

1854
01:31:21,730 --> 01:31:22,520
[Bill] Of course.

1855
01:31:23,150 --> 01:31:25,630
Folks, it looks like Fred
is getting whisked away.

1856
01:31:25,870 --> 01:31:28,070
I'm Bill Z and we're gonna
move on to the next segment.

1857
01:31:28,310 --> 01:31:29,580
- Is he here?
- Not yet.

1858
01:31:30,260 --> 01:31:33,110
Are you guys ready for
some bear-on-bear action?

1859
01:31:33,350 --> 01:31:35,260
[applause]

1860
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:36,530
This is a porn, right?

1861
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:42,260
No, seriously, John Adam and I are
so proud to be premiering this film.

1862
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:43,850
I can't believe he's not coming.

1863
01:31:44,090 --> 01:31:46,280
He'll be here. Just go
out there and kill it, okay?

1864
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:47,620
You've earned this.

1865
01:31:47,860 --> 01:31:49,310
So, without further ado,

1866
01:31:49,550 --> 01:31:51,520
I'd like to introduce
a dear friend of mine,

1867
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:53,790
and the director of Beartopia:

1868
01:31:54,030 --> 01:31:55,450
Fred Richards-Dean!

1869
01:31:55,690 --> 01:31:57,640
[cheers and applause]

1870
01:31:57,880 --> 01:31:59,050
Thank you, Pat.

1871
01:31:59,290 --> 01:32:00,590
Thank you, guys.

1872
01:32:00,830 --> 01:32:02,770
It's really exciting for us to be here.

1873
01:32:04,365 --> 01:32:07,080
[everyone talking at once]

1874
01:32:12,580 --> 01:32:14,040
This has alcohol in it.

1875
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:16,580
- "Sphincterine"?
- It's like Altoids for your ass.

1876
01:32:16,820 --> 01:32:17,970
Why would you need that?

1877
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:20,040
You're kidding.

1878
01:32:21,310 --> 01:32:22,260
I like a little...

1879
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:23,840
[Susan] Owww!!!

1880
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:25,570
[everyone shouting at once]

1881
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:31,140
One. Two. Three!

1882
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:32,540
Can I get a towel, Rex?

1883
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:33,620
A clean towel!

1884
01:32:35,185 --> 01:32:36,110
Easy, easy...

1885
01:32:37,870 --> 01:32:39,320
Lift your head up.

1886
01:32:39,690 --> 01:32:40,960
- You got this?
- I got this.

1887
01:32:42,790 --> 01:32:43,740
Hey! Hey.

1888
01:32:47,650 --> 01:32:48,980
- Yo, John Adam.
- Hey, Roger.

1889
01:32:49,220 --> 01:32:50,620
Have you seen Michael or Dalton?

1890
01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:51,960
They were here yesterday.

1891
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:54,630
They left their car here because
we lent them an ATV.

1892
01:32:55,470 --> 01:32:56,500
They leave you the keys?

1893
01:32:56,740 --> 01:32:58,650
Yeah. C'mon, I have them here.

1894
01:32:59,980 --> 01:33:03,110
Um... I spent the better part of two years

1895
01:33:03,350 --> 01:33:05,560
making this film with my husband Brent.

1896
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:07,440
Who, um...

1897
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:12,200
Who, uh, couldn't be here tonight. Um...

1898
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:15,580
But, uh... who could be here, is, uh...

1899
01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:18,600
I mean, who is here is a great guy

1900
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:20,770
who helped me find the pace,

1901
01:33:21,010 --> 01:33:23,230
and the heart, really,

1902
01:33:23,470 --> 01:33:24,450
of our movie.

1903
01:33:24,690 --> 01:33:26,470
The editor of Beartopia:

1904
01:33:26,710 --> 01:33:27,470
Mr. Max Russo.

1905
01:33:27,710 --> 01:33:29,780
[applause]

1906
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:31,710
- Push!
- Ahhh!!!

1907
01:33:31,950 --> 01:33:33,140
Do you have reception?

1908
01:33:33,380 --> 01:33:34,480
Wayne's on the way.

1909
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:36,230
Come on! Is that right?

1910
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:38,500
No, no! Don't swing!

1911
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:39,900
Just push.

1912
01:33:41,530 --> 01:33:43,220
You can do it! Come on! Push!

1913
01:33:43,460 --> 01:33:45,930
Clear that cart and put
clean towels down, now!

1914
01:33:50,770 --> 01:33:52,220
This place is ridiculous!

1915
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:54,150
Look at me: what do you need?

1916
01:33:55,390 --> 01:33:56,230
I need Fred.

1917
01:33:56,470 --> 01:33:57,490
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1918
01:33:57,730 --> 01:33:58,730
- Okay!
- Thank you.

1919
01:33:58,970 --> 01:33:59,950
I'll grab him!

1920
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:03,200
Yes! Come on, you can do it!

1921
01:34:04,570 --> 01:34:06,190
We're doing it!

1922
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:12,173
Thanks everyone for being here.

1923
01:34:12,413 --> 01:34:14,943
We're waiting for the sun to set
before we start the film.

1924
01:34:15,926 --> 01:34:17,230
Until then...

1925
01:34:18,290 --> 01:34:19,930
Whoa... you are cute!

1926
01:34:21,130 --> 01:34:22,450
You and me later... head shed...

1927
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:24,090
...bring your friends. Okay?

1928
01:34:25,530 --> 01:34:26,390
He was talking to me.

1929
01:34:26,630 --> 01:34:28,920
I don't think so, Dick Dynasty.

1930
01:34:29,180 --> 01:34:29,910
Oww!

1931
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:32,800
- Never stops, does it, Max?
- Well, you know...

1932
01:34:33,180 --> 01:34:34,270
- How are ya?
[Tyler] Fred!!

1933
01:34:35,530 --> 01:34:36,500
Fred!!

1934
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:38,570
Whoa!!

1935
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:43,900
- Chris! Where's Fred?!
- He's under the screen!

1936
01:34:44,570 --> 01:34:45,450
We're having a baby!

1937
01:34:45,690 --> 01:34:46,420
- Now?!
- Yes!

1938
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:48,200
- Is Brent with her?
- Yes! Come on!

1939
01:34:48,630 --> 01:34:50,360
- Max!
- I got this!

1940
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:52,540
Give it up, people!

1941
01:34:52,780 --> 01:34:54,500
My boy is having a baby!

1942
01:34:55,980 --> 01:34:57,660
Go... that way...

1943
01:34:58,120 --> 01:34:59,690
down... straight that way.

1944
01:34:59,940 --> 01:35:00,660
Suze!!

1945
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:02,280
I'm coming!

1946
01:35:02,630 --> 01:35:03,330
Brent!

1947
01:35:03,570 --> 01:35:05,900
Okay, Susan, one more push,
we're almost there!

1948
01:35:08,205 --> 01:35:09,925
Ahh!!!

1949
01:35:11,070 --> 01:35:12,350
Oh my god, this is so gross!

1950
01:35:14,060 --> 01:35:15,840
I need towels and water—now!

1951
01:35:22,048 --> 01:35:23,518
[Brent sobbing and laughing]

1952
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:26,636
Wayne, thank god you're here.

1953
01:35:26,876 --> 01:35:29,340
It looks like Simon's
doing a pretty good job.

1954
01:35:29,580 --> 01:35:30,700
[Simon] Get him off me!

1955
01:35:31,350 --> 01:35:33,020
[Brent sobbing]

1956
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:35,340
Baby—that was amazing!

1957
01:35:37,230 --> 01:35:38,620
Oh... my god.

1958
01:35:38,860 --> 01:35:40,550
You are dead!

1959
01:35:40,790 --> 01:35:42,380
[Fred] Brent!

1960
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:43,380
Fred!

1961
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:46,580
Baby, I'm so sorry!

1962
01:35:46,820 --> 01:35:48,300
I'm sorry, too.

1963
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:50,920
- And I'm sorry I missed it.
- You got here right on time.

1964
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:52,210
No, he didn't.

1965
01:35:52,720 --> 01:35:53,700
Oh, my god!

1966
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:56,400
Suzie!

1967
01:36:01,270 --> 01:36:02,650
Guess what I just saw?

1968
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:05,040
A shooting star?

1969
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:07,570
No—your wish come true.

1970
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:10,380
I love you, sis.

1971
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:11,940
You better.

1972
01:36:13,170 --> 01:36:14,380
Look at you.

1973
01:36:14,620 --> 01:36:15,650
I'm a mess.

1974
01:36:15,890 --> 01:36:18,930
Congratulations—you have
a healthy baby boy.

1975
01:36:19,170 --> 01:36:21,110
[baby cries]

1976
01:36:21,350 --> 01:36:24,160
Give the boy to him,
get me out of this sling.

1977
01:36:28,430 --> 01:36:30,360
Oh, god, he's so heavy!

1978
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:31,600
Oh, god.

1979
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:34,350
[Brent sobbing]

1980
01:36:34,590 --> 01:36:35,470
He's beautiful.

1981
01:36:35,710 --> 01:36:37,280
[baby crying]

1982
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:41,730
Oh, god, we're fathers now.

1983
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:44,200
Yeah—we are.

1984
01:36:48,010 --> 01:36:49,080
Congratulations, boys!

1985
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:57,950
Thank you so much, Simon.
I knew you could do it.

1986
01:36:58,200 --> 01:36:59,570
[Fred] Yeah, thank you, Simon.

1987
01:36:59,810 --> 01:37:00,900
Wait... what did Simon do?

1988
01:37:01,140 --> 01:37:02,340
He delivered the baby!

1989
01:37:02,580 --> 01:37:03,820
[Tyler] Simon...
[Fred] What?

1990
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:05,980
I'm sorry I didn't believe in you.

1991
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:07,460
It's okay.

1992
01:37:07,700 --> 01:37:08,950
I'll always believe in you.

1993
01:37:13,030 --> 01:37:14,410
I believe in all you guys.

1994
01:37:15,610 --> 01:37:16,730
We're a family.

1995
01:37:17,690 --> 01:37:18,910
All of us.

1996
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:29,090
Fuck! Shit!

1997
01:37:30,250 --> 01:37:31,400
Wait, wait!

1998
01:37:31,910 --> 01:37:32,810
The tree line.

1999
01:37:33,050 --> 01:37:33,810
What about it?

2000
01:37:34,050 --> 01:37:35,630
We're losing light...

2001
01:37:35,870 --> 01:37:37,210
and fatty ate all the food.

2002
01:37:37,450 --> 01:37:38,650
I'm still here!

2003
01:37:38,890 --> 01:37:43,190
The interstate is down that
hill, just past those trees.

2004
01:37:43,430 --> 01:37:44,470
You sure?

2005
01:37:44,710 --> 01:37:46,040
Trust. We got this.

2006
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:47,500
- Okay!
- Yeah?

2007
01:37:47,740 --> 01:37:48,600
Let's do it!

2008
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:50,610
[Michael] Okay!

2009
01:37:52,090 --> 01:37:52,950
Y'all ready?

2010
01:37:54,380 --> 01:37:55,210
Here we go.

2011
01:37:55,450 --> 01:37:57,860
[Emma] We just need enough
speed to get past the tree line.

2012
01:37:58,100 --> 01:37:59,690
[Michael] Oh, trust me—we will.

2013
01:38:47,780 --> 01:38:48,820
Woo hoo!!

2014
01:38:49,060 --> 01:38:49,820
It worked!!

2015
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:51,570
Ah ha ha!!

2016
01:38:52,370 --> 01:38:53,090
Yes!!

2017
01:38:54,950 --> 01:38:57,040
There you guys are—
I've been looking for you!

2018
01:38:57,280 --> 01:38:58,920
You are a life saver!

2019
01:38:59,160 --> 01:39:00,790
She's the life saver!

2020
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:03,590
Yes, she is.

2021
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:06,170
Actually,

2022
01:39:06,410 --> 01:39:08,380
my other dad is the life saver.

2023
01:39:08,620 --> 01:39:09,840
Aww!

2024
01:39:14,750 --> 01:39:16,780
[John Adam] This has
been an exciting evening.

2025
01:39:17,020 --> 01:39:19,220
What do you think, Dan—
should we build a nursery?

2026
01:39:19,460 --> 01:39:22,270
[Dan] "Cub Care Available."
Your mom will love it.

2027
01:39:22,510 --> 01:39:24,780
As long as we don't build
it near The Pavilion.

2028
01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:26,270
[laughter]

2029
01:39:28,150 --> 01:39:29,600
Fred, do you want to hold him?

2030
01:39:30,570 --> 01:39:31,360
Umm...

2031
01:39:31,870 --> 01:39:33,040
Come on, you're ready.

2032
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:34,320
Okay.

2033
01:39:36,950 --> 01:39:37,790
Support his head.

2034
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:39,590
Aww.

2035
01:39:40,550 --> 01:39:41,280
[Fred] Hi.

2036
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:48,440
He has our eyes.

2037
01:39:48,870 --> 01:39:50,350
Yeah.

2038
01:39:53,670 --> 01:39:54,850
[Fred] I love you, sis.

2039
01:39:55,100 --> 01:39:56,390
I love you.

2040
01:40:02,620 --> 01:40:03,720
[Fred] Hey, sweetheart.

2041
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:17,100
You got a name yet?

2042
01:40:17,630 --> 01:40:18,850
- Uh...
- We didn't...

2043
01:40:19,090 --> 01:40:21,550
The movie's almost finished.

2044
01:40:22,030 --> 01:40:24,210
Am I doing the Q-and-A solo?

2045
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:29,180
[audience cheering]
[Michael] Brilliant! Love it!

2046
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:32,140
Bravo!

2047
01:40:32,470 --> 01:40:35,880
That may not have been a porn,
but it certainly was hot!

2048
01:40:38,030 --> 01:40:41,303
[Pat] Fred, we'll talk later about
getting me in touch with that Nate guy.

2049
01:40:44,746 --> 01:40:46,210
(Roger used to be with Nate.)

2050
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:48,080
[Pat] Now I'll hand the mic over

2051
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:50,920
to the creators of the film
for a little Q-and-A, and also

2052
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:54,310
to introduce us to the newest
member of The Woods family.

2053
01:40:54,550 --> 01:40:56,940
I'll take it from here. Get
off my grass patch, girl.

2054
01:40:57,190 --> 01:40:59,400
[Max] Give it up for Pat, naked people!

2055
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:01,580
Thank you, Pat.

2056
01:41:02,490 --> 01:41:05,610
My name is Maximiliano Russo.
I'm your fearless film editor.

2057
01:41:05,850 --> 01:41:09,140
Please welcome producer Brent
and director Fred Richards-Dean!

2058
01:41:09,380 --> 01:41:10,940
[applause]
[Michael] Fred, Fred!

2059
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:13,270
[Tyler] Ma'am, your breasts are leaking!

2060
01:41:13,510 --> 01:41:14,930
Quiet, you'll wake the baby.

2061
01:41:16,890 --> 01:41:18,840
- (That baby is so adorable.)
- (So adorable.)

2062
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:20,420
- (You did that.)
- (I did that.)

2063
01:41:20,660 --> 01:41:23,970
We'd like to introduce you to our
beautiful baby boy:

2064
01:41:24,710 --> 01:41:26,240
Little "Tea Dance."

2065
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:28,190
Hey!

2066
01:41:28,530 --> 01:41:29,870
It's not always about you two.

2067
01:41:30,860 --> 01:41:33,360
Otherwise known as Justin Richards-Dean.

2068
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:36,600
[applause and cheering]

2069
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:40,840
[Fred] Hey, guys. Any questions?

2070
01:41:44,310 --> 01:41:45,230
[Fred] Yes...?

2071
01:41:55,306 --> 01:41:56,033
[crowd screams]

2072
01:41:56,306 --> 01:41:57,166
Ahhhh!!!!!!

2073
01:41:57,496 --> 01:41:58,289
Oh, no!

2074
01:41:59,660 --> 01:42:00,670
Oh, my god!!

2075
01:42:01,796 --> 01:42:02,533
I can help him!

2076
01:42:02,773 --> 01:42:03,500
Calm down Roger.

2077
01:42:03,740 --> 01:42:04,940
This will hurt a little bit.

2078
01:42:05,180 --> 01:42:05,940
[Roger] Ahh!!!!

2079
01:42:08,180 --> 01:42:10,550
I've got it under control—try to relax.

2080
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:12,940
Don't touch my hand!

2081
01:42:13,180 --> 01:42:14,070
I'm sorry!

2082
01:42:14,310 --> 01:42:16,300
Tyler, call 911. Now!

2083
01:42:17,570 --> 01:42:18,970
[Max] Give us some room.

2084
01:42:19,820 --> 01:42:21,550
Oh, Jay—please don't let me die.

2085
01:42:21,790 --> 01:42:23,150
Roger, I'm not gonna let you die.

2086
01:42:23,390 --> 01:42:24,880
We need an ambulance

2087
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:26,570
to The Woods Campground.

2088
01:42:26,810 --> 01:42:28,800
3500 Forest Street.

2089
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:30,120
Please hurry!

2090
01:42:32,670 --> 01:42:34,420
Oh, god, Jay, what's happening to me?

2091
01:42:34,660 --> 01:42:37,200
Roger, the tent stake—
I think it nicked your aorta.

2092
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:39,530
But I've got the
bleeding under control.

2093
01:42:39,770 --> 01:42:42,270
We're gonna get through
this, okay? I promise.

2094
01:42:44,690 --> 01:42:45,603
Jay, I'm...

2095
01:42:45,843 --> 01:42:46,986
I'm sorry.

2096
01:42:48,090 --> 01:42:49,600
[Roger] I'm so sorry.

2097
01:42:49,860 --> 01:42:51,600
I'm sorry, too, Roger.

2098
01:42:52,990 --> 01:42:55,020
[Jay] Just try to relax, okay?

2099
01:42:55,260 --> 01:42:57,650
[Jay] At least we stopped the bleeding.

2100
01:42:57,890 --> 01:42:59,130
[Tyler] Roger!

2101
01:42:59,370 --> 01:43:00,400
Jesus, Jay, is he dead?!

2102
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:02,050
Tyler, please calm down!

2103
01:43:02,290 --> 01:43:03,726
He's okay.

2104
01:43:03,966 --> 01:43:06,373
He's in shock. But...

2105
01:43:06,863 --> 01:43:09,390
I'm sorry, Tyler. I didn't mean
to hurt him this way...

2106
01:43:09,630 --> 01:43:11,420
when I saw the two
of you together...

2107
01:43:11,660 --> 01:43:13,450
It's okay, Jay—I know.

2108
01:43:14,510 --> 01:43:16,010
- He just...
- I know.

2109
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:17,940
I should have known.

2110
01:43:18,550 --> 01:43:21,700
But what I need for you to do
right now is to just relax, okay?

2111
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:26,090
Hey.

2112
01:43:27,370 --> 01:43:28,600
Is he gonna be all right?

2113
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:29,830
He's gonna be fine.

2114
01:43:30,070 --> 01:43:31,756
I've got the bleeding stopped.

2115
01:43:31,996 --> 01:43:33,653
As long as I don't move my hand...

2116
01:43:33,893 --> 01:43:35,575
we can get him to the emergency room,

2117
01:43:35,815 --> 01:43:37,895
this wound will be a
walk in the park for them.

2118
01:43:38,135 --> 01:43:38,867
Okay?

2119
01:43:40,557 --> 01:43:41,590
Umm...

2120
01:43:42,380 --> 01:43:43,630
What?! What is it?

2121
01:43:45,460 --> 01:43:48,110
They're sending the fire department, too.

2122
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:50,590
I know.

2123
01:43:51,690 --> 01:43:54,170
Your fire department.

2124
01:43:55,750 --> 01:43:56,840
I know that, Tyler.

2125
01:44:02,870 --> 01:44:05,760
Did you know that when
you put your hand in there?

2126
01:44:06,610 --> 01:44:08,240
Yes, I did.

2127
01:44:13,530 --> 01:44:15,040
What do you need me to do?

2128
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:17,110
Tyler, I need you to hold my hand...

2129
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:18,940
[approaching sirens wailing]

2130
01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:22,710
...and don't let go for nothing.

2131
01:44:22,950 --> 01:44:23,750
I won't.

2132
01:44:25,470 --> 01:44:27,670
I love you, Jay.

2133
01:44:29,270 --> 01:44:31,000
I love you, Tyler.

2134
01:44:55,340 --> 01:44:57,300
[Fred] He loves it when
you lift up the stroller.

2135
01:44:57,540 --> 01:44:58,390
[Rose] Does he?

2136
01:44:58,630 --> 01:44:59,880
- Like a wheelie?
- Yeah!

2137
01:45:00,120 --> 01:45:02,233
I'm gonna report you. That's abuse.

2138
01:45:02,476 --> 01:45:04,610
[Brent] I'm thinking about
it—what's the date?

2139
01:45:04,850 --> 01:45:06,430
[Rose] Enough with the bears!

2140
01:45:06,670 --> 01:45:09,730
- What if he turns out straight? And thin?
- It's a possibility.

2141
01:45:10,430 --> 01:45:12,920
Thank you, we would love
to be a part of your festival.

2142
01:45:13,160 --> 01:45:15,080
Hold on—Fred, do we
want to go to Australia?

2143
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:17,180
No! That's way too far
for the baby to travel.

2144
01:45:17,420 --> 01:45:18,430
I can take care of him!

2145
01:45:18,670 --> 01:45:20,290
- We're gonna pass.
- Why?

2146
01:45:20,770 --> 01:45:23,360
Thanks so much. Can I
call you back? Great.

2147
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:26,980
- You'll have to leave him sometime.
- Don't even think about it.

2148
01:45:27,220 --> 01:45:28,370
That is true.

2149
01:45:28,610 --> 01:45:32,070
[phone vibrates] If this is the
French festival, we are going.

2150
01:45:32,310 --> 01:45:34,980
Bonjour! Voulez-vous
coucher avec moi ce soir?

2151
01:45:35,220 --> 01:45:37,370
When did my son learn really bad French?

2152
01:45:37,610 --> 01:45:39,450
He has this crazy idea that as a producer,

2153
01:45:39,690 --> 01:45:41,000
if he learns some local phrases,

2154
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:43,180
they'll take pity on him
and speak English.

2155
01:45:43,770 --> 01:45:45,160
It's actually very smart!

2156
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:46,530
[Rose] Look who's here!

2157
01:45:46,770 --> 01:45:47,550
Hello, lady!

2158
01:45:47,790 --> 01:45:48,570
Good to see you.

2159
01:45:48,810 --> 01:45:50,500
Hello, little baby...

2160
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:54,760
Oui, oui... oui. Merci beaucoup!

2161
01:45:55,850 --> 01:45:57,580
- We're going to Paris.
- We can't do that!

2162
01:45:57,820 --> 01:45:58,740
Zip it—we're going.

2163
01:45:58,980 --> 01:46:02,220
What if he gets an ear infection
on the plane? His eardrum could pop!

2164
01:46:02,460 --> 01:46:04,760
- Mom, can you help me?
- Shut up or my eardrums will pop.

2165
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,800
Help me with this
overprotective man?

2166
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:09,110
- I think you're doomed.
- Thank you.

2167
01:46:09,350 --> 01:46:11,390
Michael, where's your family, honey?

2168
01:46:11,680 --> 01:46:12,810
We're right here.

2169
01:46:13,310 --> 01:46:15,120
Finally good to see you!

2170
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:16,680
- Hi!
- Hi.

2171
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:19,970
- You must be Emma.
- And you must be Mama Rose.

2172
01:46:20,370 --> 01:46:22,810
Mama? Very good,
how did you know that?

2173
01:46:23,050 --> 01:46:23,860
[Emma] Hey!

2174
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:29,110
Watch your email, Dad.

2175
01:46:29,350 --> 01:46:30,900
It's nice to meet you, Mama Rose.

2176
01:46:31,140 --> 01:46:34,150
[Rose] It's nice to meet you, so
charming and smart. Fantastic!

2177
01:46:34,390 --> 01:46:36,830
Yes—she's my little Anonymous.

2178
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:38,900
Am I missing something?

2179
01:46:39,140 --> 01:46:42,040
Are you two actually
texting each other right now?

2180
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:43,250
Don't judge.

2181
01:46:44,070 --> 01:46:45,740
It's like I'm raising two children.

2182
01:46:47,320 --> 01:46:48,310
[phone vibrates]

2183
01:46:48,910 --> 01:46:50,270
Fred. This is Cologne.

2184
01:46:50,510 --> 01:46:52,940
- Willst du mich binden?
- Nein!

2185
01:46:53,180 --> 01:46:54,980
Did he just ask to be
"tied up" in German?

2186
01:46:55,220 --> 01:46:56,260
I think he did.

2187
01:46:56,500 --> 01:46:57,380
Hello, love!

2188
01:46:57,620 --> 01:47:00,140
[Rose] Look who it is—
my favorite. Don't tell the rest.

2189
01:47:01,060 --> 01:47:02,480
Hi, beautiful.

2190
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:04,490
You brought the hero!

2191
01:47:04,790 --> 01:47:05,580
Congratulations.

2192
01:47:05,820 --> 01:47:07,490
Thank you. I was only doing my job.

2193
01:47:07,730 --> 01:47:09,656
Ooh, he is being modest.

2194
01:47:09,896 --> 01:47:11,043
He was amazing.

2195
01:47:11,283 --> 01:47:12,470
Well, it was his fault.

2196
01:47:13,480 --> 01:47:14,220
Emma!

2197
01:47:14,580 --> 01:47:15,350
Sorry.

2198
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:17,420
[Dalton] Sorry. Kids!

2199
01:47:17,690 --> 01:47:19,490
Well, technically, she's right.

2200
01:47:19,730 --> 01:47:21,320
I did lose my temper and I'm...

2201
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:22,590
very sorry for that.

2202
01:47:22,830 --> 01:47:25,260
But there's some good
news out of it, right?

2203
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:28,490
His best friend's son is
pretty accepting of us.

2204
01:47:28,730 --> 01:47:30,850
And he's getting his father on board, too.

2205
01:47:31,420 --> 01:47:33,370
I wouldn't go that far. But, I tell you,

2206
01:47:33,670 --> 01:47:36,410
it is nice not to have to
live a double life anymore.

2207
01:47:36,650 --> 01:47:38,990
And the guys at the
firehouse love me!

2208
01:47:39,230 --> 01:47:40,700
I bet they do.

2209
01:47:40,940 --> 01:47:41,940
That's true.

2210
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:44,520
And we're heading to
his family reunion, as well.

2211
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:46,340
Never to be heard from again.

2212
01:47:46,580 --> 01:47:47,380
Shut up.

2213
01:47:47,620 --> 01:47:48,760
[Rose] Everything's perfect!

2214
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
There's Roger over
there, under the tent.

2215
01:47:51,460 --> 01:47:53,220
[Rob] Here you go, just sign here.

2216
01:47:55,590 --> 01:47:57,920
Thank you very much for
your support. Have a great day.

2217
01:47:58,360 --> 01:47:59,780
- You got it?
- Yeah, we're good.

2218
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:03,550
Are you gonna be
eating all of those cookies?

2219
01:48:04,140 --> 01:48:06,640
Um, hello! These are free cookies!

2220
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:09,210
- They're for the customers.
- Which I made.

2221
01:48:09,460 --> 01:48:11,190
I know, but do you need to eat them all?

2222
01:48:11,430 --> 01:48:12,250
Wow!

2223
01:48:14,660 --> 01:48:16,080
- So, Roger...
- Yeah?

2224
01:48:16,330 --> 01:48:17,860
What's going on with that Kyle guy?

2225
01:48:18,100 --> 01:48:21,040
Oh. Nothing... I'm...

2226
01:48:21,470 --> 01:48:24,380
...just gonna focus on myself for a while.

2227
01:48:24,670 --> 01:48:25,870
Makes sense.

2228
01:48:41,460 --> 01:48:43,290
[Emma] Dad, can I have a cookie?

2229
01:48:43,530 --> 01:48:44,310
No.

2230
01:48:45,570 --> 01:48:46,380
Emma...

2231
01:48:46,620 --> 01:48:48,050
Dad—can I have a cookie?

2232
01:48:48,290 --> 01:48:49,050
[Dalton] Michael!

2233
01:48:49,290 --> 01:48:50,640
C'mon, Dad, I just...

2234
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:51,970
- I'll take that!
- Simon!

2235
01:48:52,210 --> 01:48:53,820
I'm trying to help you out, girl.

2236
01:48:54,060 --> 01:48:55,090
Gross!

2237
01:48:56,390 --> 01:48:58,440
- Yum!
- Jerk.

2238
01:48:59,555 --> 01:49:00,635
[Roger laughs]

2239
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:04,400
So, Roger peddles t-shirts
for Out Of The Closet now?

2240
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:06,750
Babe! He had a near death experience!

2241
01:49:06,990 --> 01:49:09,260
I'll have you know he's the
financial advisor for them.

2242
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:11,740
So you boys need to learn some respect.

2243
01:49:11,980 --> 01:49:13,600
- Sorry, sir.
- Sorry, Mama Bear.

2244
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:15,450
That's better.

2245
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:17,300
Should we get some cookies?

2246
01:49:17,540 --> 01:49:19,360
[Michael] Hallelujah!
[Justin starts crying]

2247
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:20,940
[Brent] One mention of cookies

2248
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:22,590
and you sound the alarm.

2249
01:49:22,830 --> 01:49:23,830
Just like his Grandma.

2250
01:49:24,070 --> 01:49:25,430
[Fred] I'll get him.

2251
01:49:31,490 --> 01:49:32,800
God, I love stroller meat!

2252
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:33,820
I know, right?
