00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,299

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,899
d But, bitch, please,

6

d Straight off the streets d

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,399
- No, she didn't.
- What'd I tell you!

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,899
- No, she didn't.
- What'd I tell you!

9
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,399
- Oh!
- Mm!

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
Damn, Jimmy. I can't believe

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,399
Jake's letting you
use the basement

12
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,776
of the pizza shop
for these battles.

13
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,699
What Cousin-uncle
Jake don't know

14
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,500
don't hurt Cousin-uncle Jesse.

15
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,399
That's what I'm saying, son.

16
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,799
These battles bring
you back, cuz?

17
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,799
I remember when you used to
spit back in high school.

18
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,299
I spit a little bit,

19
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,176
then I got my braces off, turned
into a pretty decent rapper.

20
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,799
Yeah, you did. You did.

21
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,199
Maybe I should dust
those rhymes off,

22
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,999
come back next week, teach
these girls what's up.

23
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,299
I've been listening
to Bone Thugs.

24
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,899
Well, let me break it
down for you like this...

25
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,700
these Las Hermanas Tijeras...
they're on that new-ish.

26
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,299
You're on that old-ish.

27
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,699
You want to get
up on that stage,

28
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,100
you gotta update your flow.

29
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,099
Do not question my flow, Jimmy.

30
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,299
I've had heavy flow since
day one, you know that.

31
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,900
- All right.
- I can get on this new-ish.

32
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,100
All right. Respect.

33
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,299
But one thing... you
get up on that stage,

34
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,999
you gotta bring a crew.

35
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,999
- Oh, that's what's up?
- That's what's up.

36
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,200
Hey! Hey, there's a two-pizza
blunt minimum, asshole.

37
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,199
No exceptions! No exceptions!

38
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,300
- Hey, buds.
- Oh, God, Abbey!

39
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,299
Gross! What are you doing here?

40
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,700
I got a rap Groupon.

41
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,599
I'm supposed to meet my friends in a...
a couple hours ago.

42
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,100
- Yeah, you got ditched, Abbey.
- No!

43
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,799
It's just a tricky thing to
get people out on a Friday

44
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,599
because Saturday
is the next day,

45
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,500
and... but, who cares,
we're here, we're friends!

46
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,799
- Is this the guy?
- Yeah.

47
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,299
Come on, dude. Why you
disrespect me like that?

48
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,300
God damn it.

49
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,900
Yo, watch it!

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,399
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,300
That's what I thought,
Raggedy-ass Ann.

52
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,400
You know what? No.
I am not sorry.

53
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,799
I have had a night,
an even worse week,

54
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,399
all my friends ditched me,

55
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,599
and I've had to eat
eight damn pizza blunts

56
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,200
because Jimmy won't let
me out of my Groupon.

57
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,800
Ohhhhh!

58
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,899
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

59
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,300
Damn, little orphan Annie,

60
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,100
you just made my card.

61
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,099
You smoke?

62
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,999
Uh, yeah. I-I smoke.

63
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,299
You want to come ride with us?

64
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:27,300
Yeah. I... I-I would love to
come ride with you ladies.

65
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,899
Get some scissors.

66
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,600
Let's go.

67
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,800
What kind of scissors?

68
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,400
D Quit wasting my time d

69
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,900
d I ain't here for you d

70
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,200
d I'm just putting in work d

71
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,999
d Till my day is through d

Synced and corrected by
Aaronnmb www.addic7ed.com

73
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,000
It's called a crew, and
it has to be three deep.

74
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,299
Now, I'll rap last as
I'm clearly the leader,

75
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,499
but I need two other
rappers to go before me.

76
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,999
- Nah.
- Oh, me, me, me!

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,676
Fairbell, when I've exhausted
every other option,

78
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,999
- I'll come to you.
- That's all I'm asking.

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,899
- And yet, you keep asking it.
- Yeah, that's all I'm asking.

80
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,099
Okay, Shoemaker, I tried to get the O.G.
Park Hill crew back together.

81
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,600
No go... they're
all doctors now.

82
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,199
But you're a musician.

83
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,800
Yeah, but, no, see,
I do love music,

84
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,199
but, you know, I like rock
'n' roll and the blues.

85
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,899
I'm not into co-opting
black culture or anything.

86
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,000
Come on. It'll be easy.
I'm the main event.

87
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,600
You just get up there, grab
the mic and say whatever.

88
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,600
Yeah, but still,
even if I wanted to,

89
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,800
I've got this new
relationship with Doris,

90
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,200
and so, I can't do anything

91
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,400
'cause I got a petulant
little boy at home

92
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,499
who just sits in his
room and sulks all day

93
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,699
'cause he doesn't understand my
new relationship with his mother.

94
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:44,199
I'm sitting right here! Stop talking
about me like I don't exist!

95
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,300
And I've already told you
to watch your sass mouth,

96
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,499
- Rod, haven't I?
- Talk to me, not at me, Bill!

97
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,899
Oh, I will talk at you because
as your common-law stepfather,

98
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,199
I am allowed to.

99
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,899
I wish you never came
into my life, Bill!

100
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,900
I tell you what... never adopt.

101
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,699
Rodrick Samuel Knorr,
you get back here!

102
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,000
That's just great.

103
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,499
Can I be in your rap crew now?

104
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,499
Fairbell, I'm still gonna ask a
lot more people first, okay?

105
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,900
Wouldn't have it any other way.

106
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,300
Whoa! Somewhere, Brian Setzer
must be missing a stray cat.

107
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,699
And somewhere a glory hole is
missing that pretty little mouth.

108
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,199
Abbey! Escalation much?

109
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,800
I'm so sick of your.

110
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,300
Okay, can we talk about
our dynamic a little bit?

111
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,699
Now, see, what usually
happens is I diss you,

112
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,199
you weakly try to diss me back,

113
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,399
and then I come back even harder,
leaving you thoroughly clowned.

114
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,200
Yeah. That's over now, Holmes.

115
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,799
Were you hanging with those lesbian
gang-bangers all weekend, Abbey?

116
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,599
They are not lesbians
or in a gang.

117
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,499
They are a group of
like-minded women

118
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,399
who support each other
and never leave a friend

119
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,000
hanging on Friday night and...

120
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,500
may have stolen some
Blu-rays from Best Buy.

121
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,999
Mm. Any copies of "Rush Hour 2"?

122
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Uh, four of 'em.

123
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,500
I'll take all four.
$60 sound fair?

124
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,099
Thank you, Fairbell.

125
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,299
You're just jealous you don't
have any friends for life.

126
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,600
- For life?
- Mm-hmm.

127
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,699
You met them on Friday. I
have plenty of friends.

128
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,999
Oh, yeah? Name two.

129
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,099
- Me, me, me, me, me.
- Coty and Dalton.

130
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,599
That's what I thought.

131
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,599
Now give me that scone,
you friendless bitch.

132
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,799
What?!

133
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,200
I guess just drop my wallet and
the Blu-rays off tomorrow?

134
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,600
She is tough.

135
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,499
That was rough.

136
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,800
Maybe you've had
enough of that stuff?

137
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,200
Fairbell, was that your rap?

138
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,099
Mmmmmmmmm.

139
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,599
All right. You can join my crew.

140
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,599
Yes! Oh, thank you!
That was so hard.

141
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,899
I'm gonna go get
some sports drink.

142
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,399
I need a scone first.
They're out.

143
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,900
You got it, rap leader.

144
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,300
Phil, what up, man?
What's good, homey?

145
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,400
What the blood clot, son?

146
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,099
You good? You good?

147
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,299
You know what I'm talking about?
Ha ha!

148
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,900
Bet, that's what's up.

149
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,099
Hey, listen, you and I have
not really hung out per se.

150
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,699
- That is correct.
- But I'm putting together a crew.

151
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,799
Really?

152
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,700
- Yeah.
- A crew?

153
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,700
- Uh-huh.
- Loren.

154
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:48,799
- Was hoping you could join us.
- Well, I did row crew at Bates.

155
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,299
No, Phil, this is a
different thing, all right?

156
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,300
This is a rap crew for a battle, and
I'm one rapper short, so I figured,

157
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,599
who better than my man Phil
to come spit some fire?

158
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,400
And you came to me because...?

159
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,899
Because... you're
probably a dope lyricist.

160
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,900
I'm black?

161
00:06:03,901 --> 00:06:04,999
- What?!
- Loren.

162
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,499
- No!
- You came to me because I'm black.

163
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,499
Phil, that is not
what's going on here.

164
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,200
Loren, you do know that not all
black people can rap, right?

165
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,399
Uh, Phil, you do know
that not all white people

166
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,000
think that all black
people can rap, right?

167
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,899
Hey, Tammy.

168
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,299
Phil already texted me.

169
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,900
Oh damn it!

170
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,700
Stupid Shoemaker!

171
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Stupid Mom!

172
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,799
Hey, Rod.

173
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,499
I'm not sure what I'm
interrupting here,

174
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,899
but I'm starting a rap crew

175
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,099
and I could really use a conservative
40-year-old war veteran.

176
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,999
Can't you read? The
sign says, "Keep out."

177
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,099
Don't know what she
sees in him anyway.

178
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,000
It was fine when it was
just the two of us.

179
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,099
So, I said, "I'm sorry,
Governor Romney,

180
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,599
but I'm just not
that kind of girl."

181
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,699
Now, what the hell is this?

182
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,899
It's graffiti, Cattie.

183
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,599
I can see it's graffiti, Tammy.

184
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,899
I was just hoping that you
could decipher it for me.

185
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,400
And you were hoping
this because...?

186
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,699
Because I forgot my glasses.

187
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,100
- Oh, okay.
- And you're black.

188
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,200
There it is.

189
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,100
LHT, Las Hermanas Tijeras,

190
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,000
a female Honduran prison gang.

191
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,600
I watch a lot of "Gangland."

192
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,899
almighty!

193
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,200
Now we got a gang
problem here at Smoot!

194
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,299
What the hell is this?

195
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,899
Cattie installed metal detectors
because of our "gang" problems.

196
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,399
See, that's the ticket.

197
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,200
You know, don't engage a
problem or fix a problem...

198
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,700
you search a problem
or restrict a problem

199
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,700
while we, the
beleaguered masses,

200
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,599
huddle in a line and wait
for this man in a uniform

201
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,999
to wave his wand like some sort of slave
driving sorcerer shrinking our liberties

202
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,299
until we're nothing more than
faceless, castrated non-threats.

203
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,800
You just freestyled.

204
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,299
No, I didn't. I just said what I
was thinking, and this guy...

205
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,499
No, no, no. That's what rap is.

206
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,300
You dig deep, you
find what's inside

207
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,599
and you just spit the truth.

208
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,899
So, in a way, a rap battle
is like a therapist's couch?

209
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,999
Sure. Yes, yes, exactly.

210
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,900
It's where you express
your innermost thoughts.

211
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,599
I could use that. Okay, yes.
I-I'll do it.

212
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,399
- You'll rap?
- Yeah... Well, why not?

213
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,976
- I could use the talk time.
- All right.

214
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,799
This battle is on.

215
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,300
Now, what is the hold up?

216
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,299
Yes, yes, son. What the
blood clot, Jimmy?

217
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,599
Dude, what are you doing?

218
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,199
Are you writing fake
prescriptions again?

219
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,999
You got in so much
trouble for that.

220
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,199
No! Because that would
be a federal offense!

221
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,999
I just came to tell you you're
looking at the newest M.C.

222
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,899
- of your Free-Flow Friday, son.
- Oh! You crewed up?

223
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,699
- Hell, yeah, I crewed up.
- They fresh?

224
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,476
No. They're like 40. It's
Fairbell and Shoemaker.

225
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,799
Now, who you gonna battle?

226
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,899
Dude, doesn't matter. Line
'em up, I'll mow 'em down.

227
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,599
I'm afraid it doesn't
work like that.

228
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,200
In Jimmy's dungeon, it's
all about the show.

229
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,900
Like TNT, son, you
gotta bring the drama!

230
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,599
Okay. Then I just get some beef.

231
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,099
Oh, no. You can't just come
at me with any kind of beef.

232
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,799
You gotta bring the
high-quality beef.

233
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,299
Farm to table, grass-fed
beef Friday night.

234
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,099
Yeah, absolutely. You gonna
bring the Iron Chef's

235
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,799
secret ingredient beef with you?

236
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,899
I'll bring some Wagyu beef,
I'll bring some Kobe beef,

237
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,700
I'll cook it up, serve it up, give
it to every little kid in the house.

238
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,799
You come to me with
that kind of beef?

239
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,900
I'm gonna put you up on that
stage on Friday, cousin.

240
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,200
Bet, bet. I'm out
to get that beef.

241
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,599
- All right.
- Oh, Jimmy, I forgot,

242
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,376
did you hear Nana has to
have another hip surgery?

243
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,099
- You're kidding me.
- No. Same hip.

244
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,399
You know what, we
should visit her.

245
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,899
- We should visit.
- We should visit her.

246
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,099
- Oh, my God, she would love that.
- She would love that!

247
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,799
- Call Papa.
- Okay, I'll call Papa.

248
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,699
- Let's find a time.
- All right. I'll let him know.

249
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,299
- All right. Bye.
- Bye, Jimmy.

250
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,800
What the hell are
you looking at?!

251
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,399
D All right, J.V., take a knee d

252
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,300
d I want you to see
the words out of me d

253
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,499
Coach, Coach, I-I
need you to stop.

254
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,000
D I don't want you to tattle d

255
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,899
d But this Friday night, Coach F.
Is in a rap... d

256
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,800
- Battle?
- Fight!

257
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,099
No, fight.

258
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,899
Coach, clearly you need
us to help you with this.

259
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,500
Yes, please.

260
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,199
Rap's supposed to be fun, Coach.

261
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,699
The simplest things
are the best.

262
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,899
Hey, my mom used to say
that about me all the time.

263
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,599
Yeah. How about we, uh,
let you take a listen

264
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,699
to the stuff that
we're into, huh?

265
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,200
All right. Fresh!

266
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,699
Uh, uh, what's
happening to my legs?

267
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,399
Ah, ah, ah.

268
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,700
I thought this type of
music was forbidden.

269
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,199
Hey! Watch where you're going.

270
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200
Come on!

271
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,700
Yo, what'd you just say to me?

272
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,899
I said, "Watch where
you're going."

273
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,299
This is a faculty parking lot,

274
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,200
so why don't you guys
turn this car around,

275
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,599
park on the street with
the rest of the visitors.

276
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,476
I didn't... I... You know
what, park where you'd like.

277
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,500
I didn't see the scissors.

278
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:41,276
- Okay, just park wherever you'd like.
- Y-Y-Y-Y-Y... Whoa, whoa! He's cool.

279
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,899
I mean, he's not cool, but
we shouldn't kill him.

280
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,600
Yeah, this puta better
watch his mouth!

281
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,199
Okay, okay, uh, excuse me? Puta?

282
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,399
Hablo espanol, okay?

283
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,100
Ah, hablas espanol.

284
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,599
Aah! What the... You stabbed me!

285
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,200
I thought it was escalating.

286
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,400
It wasn't escalating.

287
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,599
We were talking about verb
structure, and you stab me?

288
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,400
Yo, I just greased you, bitch!

289
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,099
Yo, whatever. Let's
just roll to Chubby's.

290
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,100
Yeah.

291
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:14,999
We're gonna roll to
Chubby's, bitch.

292
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,799
Are you serious? Those

293
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,900
Wait a minute. Wait, I think
I just found my beef!

294
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,299
Guys, I just figured
out my beef.

295
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,299
It's with Las Hermanas
Tijeras and Abbey.

296
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,400
Ha ha! Wow!

297
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,000
Oh, my God.

298
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,699
Rodrick Samuel Knorr,
you get back here!

299
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,999
Screw you! You're
not my real dad!

300
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,100
- I am your legal guardian!
- Billy, look.

301
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,500
- That was pretty cool.
- Right?

302
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,100
What's this bull

303
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,499
Cattie called a meeting to
address some gang violence.

304
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,299
- You snitch on me?
- I didn't snitch!

305
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,999
I passed out and
somebody found me.

306
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,399
You're lucky they did. I could've
died out there on those mean streets.

307
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,600
- Yeah?
- Ow!

308
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,499
Now, I have called
this emergency meetin'

309
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,499
here today to discuss the
gang issues here at Smoot.

310
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,499
It's also been brought
to my attention

311
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,899
that a teacher has been
lightly stabbed by a...

312
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,499
There is no light stabbing.

313
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,699
It's not rain. You're either
stabbed or you're not.

314
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,376
Loren, why don't you take a seat
before you pull that stitch, darling?

315
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,099
Now, I have brought with
me today my urban planner,

316
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,699
who is gonna oversee this meeting.
Tammy?

317
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,699
I'd like to reiterate
that I find it offensive

318
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,499
that just because I'm black you
assume I know about this stuff.

319
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,300
But let's get to the
root of the problem.

320
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,699
Why do people join gangs
in the first place?

321
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,600
Maybe they're so
desperate for friendship

322
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,300
they just join a
gang in a bathroom.

323
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,999
Or maybe they go
to that bathroom

324
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,800
because their friend
abandons them.

325
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,000
That is still no reason for someone to
stab someone else in a parking lot.

326
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,999
No, you didn't get stabbed. That
was just a Tijuana love tap.

327
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,800
- Don't touch it!
- This is about the students!

328
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,900
How do we resolve these issues?

329
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,899
Rap battle. Rap battle
resolves any conflict,

330
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,000
unless someone is too
"skirred" to battle.

331
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,699
I'm not too "skirred."

332
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,099
Someone doesn't want
to battle a buster!

333
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,500
Maybe someone needs to remember

334
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,399
somebody else got
dirt on the mother

335
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,200
and they wouldn't be afraid to
tell and drop a dime on that ass.

336
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,799
Okay, this is a lost cause.

337
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,500
Well, I think we made some
real progress here today.

338
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,299
I'll see you Friday, bitch.

339
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,399
Friday it is. Friday it is.

340
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,699
Yeah, I'm still not sure why
I was made to come to this.

341
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,700
Phil, do we have to have yet another
conversation about your tone?

342
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,199
All right, fam. Listen up!

343
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,199
Alright, now, we got a lot of confirmed
gangsters in the building tonight.

344
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Yeah!

345
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,599
We'll do it like this, see.

346
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,799
Put your hands in the air

347
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,500
if you got drugs on
your person right now.

348
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,000
All right.

349
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,200
Keep 'em up. Keep 'em up!
Keep 'em up.

350
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,300
All right, looks like nine,
looks like nine confirmed.

351
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,800
Nine confirmed!

352
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,899
All right, fresh gangster!

353
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,299
Boy, subtlety is not Jimmy's
strong suit, is it?

354
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,799
We'll see how subtle he is
with a bullet in his head.

355
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,799
- Dave.
- What?

356
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,499
All rappers report
to the basement.

357
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,799
Hey, hey. W-W-W-Wait.
Hey, listen.

358
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,099
I-I-I don't think this
is a very good idea.

359
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,599
Come on, Shoemaker. I need you in battle
mode, dude. Game face, all right?

360
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,499
But you never said anything
about going into a basement.

361
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,060
- So what?
- I am not good at basements.

362
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,199
It brings up a lot of dark
from the past, and I-I...

363
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,099
If you threaten not to rap
one more time, guess what?

364
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,200
I'm gonna put you on blast.

365
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,599
- What does that even mean?
- Test me.

366
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,599
I swear to God, test me
right now, Shoemaker.

367
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,999
- I'm just being hon...
- And you're on blast.

368
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,800
You happy? Until further
notice, you are on blast!

369
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,100
Where is Fairbell?

370
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,699
Yo, bitches. You ready
to get smoked like endo?

371
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,400
Can't wait to hear
your nursery rhymes

372
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You're gonna be suckin' my
by the end of the night.

373
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,099
What's up with them?

374
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,399
I can't even hear you,
because you're on blast,

375
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,299
and I can't hear
people on blast.

376
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,699
- But what does that mean?
- Blast!

377
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,599
- But I...
- B...

378
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,800
- What does...
- Blast!

379
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,400
All right, all right, all right.
We are back. Come on!

380
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,099
Come on! All right.

381
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,800
Gentlemen, ladies,
it's really simple.

382
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,800
Three rounds, freestyle,
audience picks the winner.

383
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,699
Just, quick reminder,
quick reminder...

384
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,499
I am wearing a red, button-down
shirt with no Kevlar vest.

385
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,999
Again, I am not wearing any
Kevlar on my person right now.

386
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,500
All right, all right,
let's get to it.

387
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,300
First rapper, Team Sodo.

388
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,376
I don't know where
our first rapper is.

389
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,499
If he's not here in 30
seconds, I gotta call it.

390
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,000
I hear ya, but he
said he'd be here.

391
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,199
What's your boy's name again?

392
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,900
What did he say his name was?

393
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,699
Mr. Mile High, Mr. Mile High.
Spike it, Little Debbie!

394
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,500
What's this...

395
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,000
Yeah. Mr. Mile High!

396
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,699
Mr. Mile High. Yeah!
Mr. Mile High.

397
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,999
Oh, my God.

398
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,199
Mr. Mile High. Mr. Mile High.

399
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,499
This is a rap battle. It's
not the Latin Grammys.

400
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,199
Mr. Mile High! Whoo!

401
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,100
D Dogs, dogs, dogs, dogs, dogs d

402
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,000
d Milk, milk, milk, milk, milk d

403
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,600
What the hell is he doing?

404
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,199
I think he's just listing the things
that he likes over and over again.

405
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,199
Man, I'm just glad he's not saying Mr.
Mile High any...

406
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,599
- Mr. Mile High!
- Oh, there he is. He's back.

407
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,699
- There he goes.
- He's back on it.

408
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,399
D Dogs, dogs, dogs, dogs, dogs d

409
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,999
- All right, all right!
- He's back. And he's back.

410
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,200
Give me my microphone!

411
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,699
Aah!

412
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,200
First round goes to
Las Hermanas Tijeras.

413
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,276
They didn't even rap.
They didn't even rap!

414
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,899
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but you
did, and that was enough.

415
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,299
Now, leave this place forever.

416
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,699
You're making everything
about this less cool!

417
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,400
Well, good. I have to return
my Hummer limo, so there.

418
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,700
I apologize for that sincerely.

419
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,700
All right. History
teacher, you're up.

420
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,399
Whoa, whoa. No, no, no.
I am not...

421
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,299
- No, no, no, you got this.
- I'm not doing this.

422
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,799
Hey, this is what we
talked about up there.

423
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,399
- We're in the dungeon now.
- You want that dark

424
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,799
- All right?
- You want

425
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,299
You can't be worse than Fairbell.
Now get out there and spit fire.

426
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,476
- No worse than Fairbell.
- You got this, Shoe, come on.

427
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,899
You got this, Shoemaker.
You got this!

428
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,099
All right.

429
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,799
Hey, you, D.J., drop that beat.

430
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,100
Ah, all right.

431
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,699
Everybody, put your hands up.

432
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,000
Put your hands up.

433
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,699
I'm about to get grimy on this

434
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,900
When I was young,

435
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,100
my neighbor used to lure
me into his basement

436
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,299
with promises of candy and soda

437
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,100
before he put his
hands into my mouth,

438
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,499
then into my

439
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,399
and then he'd tell me,
"Don't tell nobody

440
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,899
or I'll kill your entire family.

441
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,700
Don't you talk to
nobody about this.

442
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,399
- Because if you do, I'll kill you."
- Time-out, time-out, time-out.

443
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,476
- Shoemaker, Shoemaker.
- What?

444
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,899
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean, what am I doing?

445
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,476
- What are you doing out there?
- I'm finding my darkness.

446
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,299
No. You're supposed
to go at them.

447
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,799
Go at them. Aggressive-style,
on the attack.

448
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,800
Oh, okay. My bad.

449
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,999
- Yeah.
- Okay.

450
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,299
- Just...
- Out of context, that was...

451
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,499
All right, man, take
another shot at it.

452
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,299
A'ight. Sorry about
that, everybody.

453
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,100
Hey, yo, D.J., drop that beat!

454
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,699
I apologize.

455
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,799
Hey, yo, hey, yo.

456
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,200
Put your hands back in the air!

457
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,599
Put 'em up again!

458
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,800
Get 'em up!

459
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,100
All right, I hate
you, I hate you,

460
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,100
I hate your whole crew.

461
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,499
For not being there that
day in the basement

462
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,300
when my neighbor had his
hands in my mouth and in my

463
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,699
You could have stopped Keith.

464
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,899
You could've told him. You
could've ran for help.

465
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,799
But none of you were there!

466
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,999
No Shoemaker. Shoemaker.
Shoemaker.

467
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,299
Okay. Okay!

468
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,099
There are some things
going on up here

469
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,300
that are clearly beyond the
scope of a rap battle.

470
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,000
So Las Hermanas
Tijeras win again.

471
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,300
Nah. Nah, he can
have that round.

472
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,900
I don't even want that.

473
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,499
That too real.

474
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,799
That's very nice of you.
Thank you.

475
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,499
No.

476
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,999
Yeah. This wasn't
the place for this,

477
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,500
but I-I appreciate you having
me down to your basement.

478
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,500
Thank you for making a
little pathway for me.

479
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,899
All right!

480
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,899
So... So, we all tied up,
heading into the final round.

481
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,199
- All right.
- Yeah!

482
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,899
You know what, let
that bitch go first.

483
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,799
- Oh, yeah?
- See what you got, Logan.

484
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,899
See what you got.

485
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,700
Yo, D.J., drop that beat.

486
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,999

I'm coming at them
on their level.

504
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,600
Hey, yo, D.J., play
that track I gave you.

505
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,500
This is what's up.

506
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,799
Y'all mind if I take a turn?
Thanks.

507
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,799
Hey, yo, this is girl talk.

508
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,400
When I was a little girl,

509
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,020
I knew I was different
from my sisters.

510
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,599
I didn't like My Little Pony,

511
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,299
wasn't interested
in the mistress.

512
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,899
When you're a kid,
they call you tomboy.

513
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,499
Good at climbing trees
and on your bike.

514
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,100
When you're a teenager,
not so innocent.

515
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,300
Cornrows get you labeled...
Psych!

516
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,600
'Cause I would never use
that word for malice.

517
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,199
Never use that... for spite.

518
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,699
Took it back, looked
up the definition.

519
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,799
Stopped the flood of
hatred with this dike.

520
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,799
But, yo, that attitude...

521
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,100
that's born in perspective.

522
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,499
Took me 37 years to unlock.

523
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,599
Out there, amongst the wicked,

524
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,800
there's no judgment,
there's just girl talk.

525
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,799
- Take it home.
- D Do-do-do-do-do, girl talk d

526
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,499
- What the hell is he doing?
- He's Macklemore'ing.

527
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,799
D Just a homie in a hoodie
with a dark little secret d

528
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,599
Is he telling us he's a lesbian?

529
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,099
Nah, nah, nah, nah. See,
you would think that.

530
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,299
What he's doing,

531
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,499
he's using his
upper-middle-class perspective

532
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,000
to comment on what it's like

533
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,799
to be an inner-city
Hispanic lesbian.

534
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,500
D Talk about some girl talk d

535
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,900
This is some next-level

536
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,800

537
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,500

542
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,999
Yeah, too stunned to respond.
I'm not surprised.

543
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,199
It's some pretty next-level

544
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,499
You know what, cue it up again.

545
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,076
I think they'll get it
on the second time.

546
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,299
Wow! You a fool!

547
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,199
You know, it's 2016. It's okay
to admit you're a lesbian.

548
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,100
I just broke through the
glass ceiling for you.

549
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,899
How 'bout I break through
your glass ceiling?

550
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,199
I don't know how you'd do that.

551
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,399
As a heterosexual male, there's...
Oh, you mean stab me.

552
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,399
She's got a knife!
Mirror, mirror!

553
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,000
- Mirror, mirror!
- That's the signal.

554
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,700
Oh! Whoo! Weapons hot!

555
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,000
- Dave.
- Weapons hot!

556
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,500
Mirror, mirror!

557
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,000
DEA! Anyone with drugs,
hands against your head!

558
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:33,200
FDA! Anyone with expired
produce, up against the wall,

559
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,899
or you will be killed!

560
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,200
Give me a reason!

561
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,700
Dave.

562
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,199
Anybody would go to the
basement for a Cadbury egg!

563
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,099
It was June!

564
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,200
Ow, ow, ow! You are crushing
my private business!

565
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,899
I said I'm Mr. Mile High.

566
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,800
I don't even know what
cocaine looks like. Ow!

567
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,499
What? But I didn't do anything.

568
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,099
Yeah, she does not look like
your typical Hermana Tijera.

569
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,599
Macklemore, come
here for a second.

570
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,400
This one... she been involved
in any illicit gang activity?

571
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,799
Her? Nah, we're just hanging
out on a Friday night.

572
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,000
She's just a
boring-ass librarian.

573
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,199
Right, Abbey?

574
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,999
Yeah, I guess.

575
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,599
Yeah, no, she's not a
gangster at all, guys.

576
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,899
She's just, um... She's
just a f-friend.

577
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,199
Okay. Super-touching, too.

578
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,676
Hey, man, when does
that mix tape drop?

579
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,799
Oh, you all like real hip-hop?

580
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,499
- Yes.
- Okay. Lettuce drops in June.

581
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,899
Did you see that?

582
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,199
Loren.

583
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,400
I mean, I-I know we've
had our difficulties,

584
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:30,200
but I really feel like this is
a change in our relationsh...

585
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,699
You know, I, um, I
wanted to apologize.

586
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,599
This weekend, I was
forced to remember,

587
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,699
very publicly, just how
difficult growing up can be.

588
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,400
So, I... got you this.

589
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,999
Go ahead.

590
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Yeah?

591
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,700
Open it.

592
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,699
"Call of Battle:
Questionable Deployment"?!

593
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,700
- Yeah!
- Oh!

594
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,600
Oh, I love it, but...

595
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,999
my shrink at the V.A. hospital

596
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,200
specifically said I
shouldn't play this game.

597
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:16,100
Well, then I guess it'll have
to be just our little secret.

598
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,399
Yeah.

599
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,599
A secret you should never...

600
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,799
tell anyone.

601
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:27,100
Half the game takes place
inside of a flashback.

602
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,000
And, best of all, the FDA agent

603
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,099
said I didn't have any
drugs in my butt.

604
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,899
Way to go, Mr. Mile High.

605
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,099
I'm proud of you.

606
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,400
I gotta go.

607
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,799
Loren, I want to thank
you for the other night,

608
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,999
- even though you did ditch me again.
- Well, you're welcome,

609
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,900
and the important thing is that you
and I have reestablished our dynamic.

610
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,499
So you're out of
the gang life now?

611
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,599
You done with that?

612
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,399
The feds put most of the
power players in jail,

613
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,099
so there's not much
of a gang left.

614
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,199
So, why was your cousin
wearing a wire anyway?

615
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,800
Jake was in trouble with the FDA
'cause of some bad produce,

616
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,500
so Jimmy struck a
deal with the DEA

617
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,900
because of the drug element
hanging around the store.

618
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,499
It's standard
joint-task-force stuff.

619
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,500
Has nobody here seen "The Wire"?

620
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,900
God!

621
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,100
I have a feeling Jimmy's
gonna get what he deserves.

622
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,320
<i>ENJOY!!!! Do not
miss this tomorrow!</i>
