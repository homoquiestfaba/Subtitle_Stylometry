00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:14,848
[Ding]

[Music playing]

7
00:07:50,904 --> 00:07:51,805
How'd that feel?

8
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:45,839
[Sigh]

9
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:01,321
[Sigh]

10
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,289
Mm.

11
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,291
What time is it?

12
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,293
It's a little after 4:00.

13
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,395
That late?

14
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:09,696
Wow.

15
00:12:09,797 --> 00:12:12,265
Then again, we did kind
of have a busy night.

16
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,666
Uh, look.

17
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:16,236
I don't mean to be rude, but uh,
I've got to get to work soon.

18
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:18,705
So you know, if you could...

19
00:12:18,806 --> 00:12:19,940
No problem.

20
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,477
Um, when you get back
later, we'll... we'll go out.

21
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,545
Yeah.

22
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:27,848
You know, actually,
I think... you know,

23
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:30,951
I'm positive I have
something going on tonight.

24
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:34,888
OK maybe some other time.

25
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,656
All right. Let me just
lay here a couple hours.

26
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:43,630
Um, actually, I was
kind of thinking maybe

27
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,232
You could leave right now.

28
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:49,536
Right now?

29
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:50,337
Yeah.

30
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:57,077
So let me say this out loud,
just to get it straight.

31
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:59,913
You have no reservations
about [scoffs] taking me here

32
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:03,216
And having sex with you, but you
develop a Texas-sized complex

33
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:07,120
Because you don't trust me to
stay here when you're not here?

34
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,321
What do you think, Ryan?

35
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:10,457
The minute that you leave,
a van's gonna pull up

36
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:12,525
And I'm going to load it with
your 200-year-old black and

37
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,594
White television, your
garage sale couch,

38
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:16,830
And your got it from someone's
curb, doesn't look great lamp?

39
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:22,502
Sorry.

40
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:24,237
I've just never
done this before.

41
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,106
[Sigh] It's nothing personal.

42
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,982
God forbid it should
be something personal.

43
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:38,418
We only fucked each other.

44
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:39,920
I'm willing to
bet you never pull

45
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,288
Any sensitivity muscles, huh?

46
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,035
[Sigh]

47
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,438
Jeez, man.

48
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:04,844
What's your number?

49
00:14:04,945 --> 00:14:05,812
Maybe I'll call you sometime.

50
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:11,451
Can you tell me my name?

51
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:12,819
[Scoffs]

52
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,387
If you can tell me my name,
then I'll give you my number.

53
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:23,663
All right.

54
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:26,433
Just... just give me a minute.

55
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:27,567
Minute's up.

56
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:28,936
You're going on two.

57
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:31,671
Listen, I think writing down
my phone number... I don't know.

58
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,206
Would be a waste of your ink.

59
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:34,007
Well, look.

60
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,009
Can't I have a hint?

61
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:37,444
Can we play charades?

62
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:53,426

Thought we had plans,
but you didn't show.

71
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:55,488
What's up?

72
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:56,756
Call me, bye.

Hi, it's Caroline.

78
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,587
You've been quite a tough
person to get a hold of lately.

79
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:29,756
You must be working
a lot or something.

80
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:33,326
Please call me when
you get this, OK?

81
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,295

[Sigh]

84
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:02,489
Hey, don't look at me like that.

85
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:03,390
I... look.

86
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,791
I'm not the Antichrist, here.

87
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:06,793
I didn't promise her a thing.

88
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:08,295
Stuck my dick in her.

89
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:11,264
Last time I checked,
that wasn't proposing.

90
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:15,068
All sex is is an enjoyable
aerobic exercise.

91
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:17,504
Unless both have formally
agreed beforehand that the act

92
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:19,339
Is equal to something more.

93
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,875
Sex just happens to require
two people, like in gym class,

94
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:23,976
When one kid would
hold your feet

95
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:25,945
Down so you could do sit ups.

96
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,647
I mean, who decreed
that by having sex,

97
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:30,083
You're suddenly attached at
the hip with that person?

98
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:31,184
The church?

99
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:32,252
Yeah.

100
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:34,321
I'm going to take
advice on my sex life

101
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:36,689
From a group who thinks copping
a feel is grounds for being

102
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,491
Sent to the 10th level of hell?

103
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:41,761
It's easy for a priest to decree
that when their entire sex life

104
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:44,664
Is a series of one man shows.

105
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:48,135
[Scoffs] There's no way
you can respect, let alone

106
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,502
Commit, to a woman
who will sleep

107
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:51,104
With you on the first date.

108
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:53,973
Am I wrong or what?

109
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,477
[Sigh] No.

110
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,546
Now... now I'm not happy.

111
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:01,448
But... but... but who's happy?

112
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,550
What the hell is happy, anyways?

113
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:04,917
Happy is a delusion.

114
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,987
A safety net concept invented
by the government in order

115
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,056
To make us believe we're going
to be rewarded for the shitty

116
00:18:10,157 --> 00:18:12,959
Lives we lead instead of simply
facing the fact that if we

117
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:15,328
Threw ourselves out the window,
the only thing that would

118
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,364
Change is our relatives
would save money

119
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:18,631
On buying Christmas gifts.

120
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:24,504
But... but I can definitely,
without a doubt,

121
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,673
Say that I'm content.

122
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,708
I'm content as a
breast fed baby.

123
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:06,613
Do you have any movies
where people get tied up?

124
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:08,147
Pornos are in the back.

125
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:09,482
No, not pornos.

126
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:12,352
I want movies where people
get like, tortured, you know?

127
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:14,053
Tied up and just like beaten.

128
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,656
Do you have anything like that?

129
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:18,558
You know, actually we do.

130
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,294
We have a whole section of
movies dedicated to torture.

131
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:22,895
It's right between
the section of movies

132
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,232
Dedicated to puppy
fucking and the movies

133
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:27,267
Dedicated the fecal eating.

134
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,702
But if you get to the
section on kitten burning,

135
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:30,970
Then you've gone too far.

136
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,906
Are you mocking me?

137
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:34,707
Yep.

138
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:36,142
I'd like to see the manager.

139
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:36,943
OK.

140
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:45,385
How can I help you?

141
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:46,453
You're the manager?

142
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:48,655
And you're the sharpest
knife in the drawer.

143
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:49,756
Look, bud.

144
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,224
I'm going to take a
Vegas size gamble here

145
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:53,092
And say that you're literate.

146
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,861
OK?

147
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:57,129
The sign outside
says Video Zone.

148
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,166
It doesn't say deviants,
freaks, and assholes, OK?

149
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:03,570
So why don't you take your
goofy, I'm dating my sister ass

150
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,672
And get out of my store.

151
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:06,973
Where do you get...

152
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:15,848
Have a nice day.

153
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,254
[Knocking]

154
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:30,196
What was that all about?

155
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:32,532
I swear to Christ, I think
mental institutions plan

156
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:34,301
Their field trips to our store.

157
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:35,335
Bad day?

158
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:37,570
You know, I did
an informal poll.

159
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,106
Half our customers slash
inmates are on some type

160
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:42,409
Of antipsychotic medication.

161
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:44,577
Every fucking customer
that has come in here today

162
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:47,580
Look like they belong at the
open casting call for the kid

163
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,182
On the porch in "Deliverance."

164
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:52,719
I don't even think we're
managing a video store anymore.

165
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:55,355
I think we've crossed over
into some unknown circle

166
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:57,223
Of Dante's "Inferno."

167
00:20:57,324 --> 00:21:00,893
This is a rest stop
on the way to hell.

168
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,562
Who's that?

169
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:04,297
This new guy who
works here nights.

170
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:05,264
He's a temp.

171
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:06,866
His name's Alex
something or other.

172
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:07,667
Hm.

173
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:08,868
Is he cool?

174
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:10,236
He's OK.

175
00:21:10,337 --> 00:21:12,038
I mean, I don't want
to drive cross country

176
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:13,740
With him or anything, if
that's what you're saying.

177
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,512
Just, he doesn't talk.

178
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:20,913
What?

179
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:24,917
I tried striking up a
coworker rapport of sorts.

180
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,252
- Employee banter?
- Exactly.

181
00:21:26,353 --> 00:21:27,253
Got nothing.

182
00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:28,921
As a conversationalist,
the guy ranks

183
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,122
Right there at the bottom.

184
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:32,925
Right between Benedictine
monks and street mimes.

185
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,293
You're a snob, man.

186
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:35,094
What?

187
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:35,895
You are.

188
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:36,896
You're an intellectual snob.

189
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:38,498
Get the hell out of here.

190
00:21:38,598 --> 00:21:39,999
It's the truth, man.

191
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:41,701
You've got a problem
with everybody.

192
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,102
Uh, he doesn't talk enough.

193
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:44,604
He babbles too much.

194
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:46,005
He said irony instead
of coincidence.

195
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:48,341
Yeah, I've got a low
stupidity tolerance.

196
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:49,876
What's wrong with that?

197
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:50,810
You tell me.

198
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:51,911
When was your last girlfriend?

199
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:53,746
Hey man, that was my
mom's fault, all right?

200
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:55,682
I brought her home and
my mom started drilling

201
00:21:55,782 --> 00:21:57,450
Her about her sexual history.

202
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,250
Crabs?

203
00:21:58,351 --> 00:21:59,452
What about crabs?

204
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:00,286
Do you have crabs?

205
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:01,954
Have you been checked for crabs?

206
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:02,789
[Sigh] No, no.

207
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:04,190
I'm not talking about that one.

208
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,426
I'm talking about
the one before that.

209
00:22:06,526 --> 00:22:07,226
Jennifer?

210
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,562
Well, Jennifer failed the test.

211
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:10,697
No.

212
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:12,499
You didn't give her the
"Raising Arizona" test.

213
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,733
Fuckin' A I did.

214
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,368
And there's no way the
relationship could continue,

215
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:16,936
Because she failed that test.

216
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:18,505
What the hell does that prove?

217
00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:20,206
It proves
everything, all right?

218
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:23,776
If you cannot enjoy a brilliant
cinematic comedic masterpiece

219
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:26,613
Like Joel and Ethan's "Raising
Arizona," then you are bound...

220
00:22:26,713 --> 00:22:28,147
I mean, like,
genetically bound...

221
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:30,182
To show up with deep
or numerous human

222
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,585
Flaws somewhere along the line.

223
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,120
And Wilt Chamberlain,
you are the last one

224
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,256
Who should be lecturing
me about my love life.

225
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,659
You realize we got a
pool going in the back?

226
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:41,761
All the customers are placing
bets to see what happens

227
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:44,130
First, AIDS or Ryan Junior.

228
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,698
The amount of women
you slept with

229
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:47,299
Looks like the sign at
McDonald's that are how

230
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,470
Many millions they've served.

231
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,104
Look, why don't you
just shut the fuck up

232
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,005
About that, all right?

233
00:22:58,277 --> 00:23:00,547
All right, look. "Raising
Arizona" wasn't the only reason

234
00:23:00,647 --> 00:23:01,448
I broke up with Jennifer.

235
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:06,252
What was the other reason?

236
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:08,120
She said she wouldn't
read Shakespeare's "Richard"

237
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,090
"III" because she hates sequels.

238
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,593
[Laughs]

239
00:23:13,693 --> 00:23:14,627
Oh.

240
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:15,428
Fuck!

241
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:22,168
So are you coming tonight?

242
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:23,603
It's tonight?

243
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:25,472
Yeah, it's tonight.
"Blade Runner,"

244
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:28,340
Both versions, back to back
down at the Southfield.

245
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:30,376
Starts at 12:30.

246
00:23:30,477 --> 00:23:32,479
Wake up, 'cause
it's time to die.

247
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,447
Oh, well, you're
overlooking one

248
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:36,649
Very important point there, JT.

249
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,217
We don't get out of
here till 10:30, man.

250
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:39,619
By the time we get
down to the Southfield,

251
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:41,153
The show is going
to be sold out.

252
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,989
This is true.

253
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:45,858
So how are we going to get in?

254
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,994
Tickets went on sale
at 7:00 this morning.

255
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,229
Guess who slept on the
sidewalk to get 'em.

256
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:51,698
You slept on the sidewalk?

257
00:23:51,798 --> 00:23:53,232
Hell yeah, I slept
on the sidewalk.

258
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:55,702
This is "Blade Runner" we're
talking about here, all right?

259
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:57,003
I would have driven
across the Sahara

260
00:23:57,103 --> 00:24:02,408
In the trunk of a New York
taxicab if that's what it took.

261
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:03,510
Oh.

262
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,479
Hey, ask her is she
needs some help, man.

263
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,080
She doesn't, all right?

264
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:08,881
Not from me.

265
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,032
Is this any good?

266
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:28,735
I hate him already.

267
00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:29,536
Oh, I don't know.

268
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:46,919
What about this one?

269
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:50,322
I haven't seen it.

270
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:52,024
You know what I thought
was a really good movie?

271
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:52,825
I really...

272
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:54,193
Lady, listen.

273
00:24:54,293 --> 00:24:55,828
The words are running a
marathon through my mind.

274
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:57,329
Can you guess what they are?

275
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:58,130
Did I ask.

276
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:03,135
Well, I'm Michelle.

277
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:03,936
And you are?

278
00:25:07,273 --> 00:25:08,340
Not even remotely interested.

279
00:25:31,598 --> 00:25:33,900
Yeah, keep walking, Michelle.

280
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,735
Smartest move you've ever made.

281
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,050
[Phone ringing]

282
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,919
Video Zone, "Batman
and Robin" sucks.

283
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:54,286
How can I help you?

284
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,087
Hey, Mikey.

285
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:56,989
What's up?

286
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:57,790
Oh, no.

287
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:58,591
No, man.

288
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:00,259
No, no, no, no.

289
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,127
You're killing me, Mikey.

290
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:03,730
You're fucking killing me.

291
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,933
Are you sure it's broken?

292
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:09,836
Have you tried walking it off?

293
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:11,070
Have you tried a cane?

294
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,238
Have you tried a wheelchair?

295
00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:14,173
Have you tried crutches?

296
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:16,242
What about that thing that goes,
uh, that goes under the cars.

297
00:26:16,342 --> 00:26:18,177
The creeper.
Have you tried a creeper, Mikey?

298
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:20,980
Try a creeper, man.

299
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,014
All right, all right.

300
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:23,916
Well, how long are
you going to be out?

301
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:24,884
Six weeks?

302
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:26,318
What are you fucking kidding me?

303
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,654
I slept on the
sidewalk last night

304
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:31,557
And you're going to be down
for the count for six weeks?

305
00:26:31,658 --> 00:26:32,625
No, I can't drive.

306
00:26:32,725 --> 00:26:34,794
My car's in the shop.

307
00:26:34,894 --> 00:26:38,330
No, Ryan walked here.

308
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,165
The bus?

309
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:40,700
What are you fucking kidding me?

310
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,869
The bus is the
abnormal express, man.

311
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:45,237
Have you been taking long
dips in the idiot pool?

312
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,039
Have you seen people
that ride the bus?

313
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:48,174
Let me tell you something, man.

314
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,943
People that ride the bus
almost always have shoes

315
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:52,244
With Velcro on 'em, all right?

316
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,148
Mikey, you're
killing me here, man.

317
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:59,151
Come on, we've got
to do s... hello?

318
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:00,552
Hello?

319
00:27:00,653 --> 00:27:02,521
[Sigh]

320
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,157
What's going on?

321
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:07,126
He's not picking us up.

322
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:09,561
(SINGING) Yellow
submarine, you can't catch

323
00:27:09,662 --> 00:27:13,399
Me in my yellow submarine.

324
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:15,634
Don't look at them, honey.

325
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:19,305
[Laughs] All they
want to do is...

326
00:27:19,405 --> 00:27:23,710
[Laughs] all they want to do
is crossbreed lions and tigers.

327
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,812
I mean, that's all
they want to do.

328
00:27:25,912 --> 00:27:29,248
[Laughs] But before you know
it, it will be sheep, people.

329
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:30,616
Where do we draw the line?

330
00:27:30,717 --> 00:27:33,753
I mean, before you know it,
we're all going to be digested

331
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:37,790
In the bowels of progress.

332
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:43,462
Wha... yeah, this is good.

333
00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:44,263
Really good.

334
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:45,264
I like that.

335
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:46,966
Nice.

336
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:47,767
Yeah.

337
00:28:27,774 --> 00:28:29,675
[Thud]

338
00:28:29,776 --> 00:28:32,812
Hey, what the
hell are you doing?

339
00:28:32,912 --> 00:28:34,914
I... I wanted to watch a video.

340
00:28:35,014 --> 00:28:36,382
Yeah, well, you've got
to pay for it first.

341
00:28:36,482 --> 00:28:38,517
(SINGING) Yellow submarine.

342
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:40,787
Can't catch me in
my yellow submarine.

343
00:28:40,887 --> 00:28:42,088
Hey, you got some
family I can call?

344
00:28:42,188 --> 00:28:45,157
Mom and dad, rest in peace.

345
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:48,527
Baby sitter gets
letters in California.

346
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:52,765
Sister... sister loves
the... uh... bananas.

347
00:28:52,865 --> 00:28:53,565
Or bottles.

348
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:54,366
Beetles!

349
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:55,201
Yeah.

350
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:56,002
Beetles.

351
00:28:58,204 --> 00:28:59,138
Doesn't like a brother, though.

352
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,440
He... too weird.

353
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,241
Too weird.

354
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:04,710
Too crazy.

355
00:29:04,811 --> 00:29:05,611
What about some friends?

356
00:29:05,711 --> 00:29:06,645
You got some friends I can call?

357
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:07,880
One friend.

358
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,148
Only one who notices.

359
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,216
Only one who listens.

360
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:11,050
Only one who cares.

361
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,291
OK.

362
00:29:19,391 --> 00:29:20,092
We're gonna...

363
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:21,293
Mm.

364
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:22,895
Want to see a picture?

365
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:23,830
Hm?

366
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:26,198
No, I don't need
to see a picture.

367
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:27,499
OK.
Hm?

368
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,467
Go on, go on.

369
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:29,468
Have a look, man.

370
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:31,904
That's right here.

371
00:29:32,004 --> 00:29:34,540
This is your best friend.

372
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,075
Because he listens to me, man.

373
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:41,147
Don't look at him, honey!

374
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:43,015
He's crazy!

375
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,483
Nobody notices a crazy man.

376
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:47,753
Nobody thinks I notice them
not noticing, but I do!

377
00:29:47,854 --> 00:29:49,355
I do.

378
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:50,189
Right.

379
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:53,492
Nobody listens except for Ted.

380
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:56,795
[Sobbing] And he kissed
me in my yellow submarine.

381
00:29:56,896 --> 00:29:57,596
OK.

382
00:29:57,696 --> 00:29:59,265
[Sobbing]

383
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:10,009
[Laughs] Oh.

384
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:15,647
Fuckin' bananas.

385
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:16,983
[Laughs]

386
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:20,686
How the hell did
he break his leg?

387
00:30:20,786 --> 00:30:23,822
Mikey left his marijuana
in a drawer in his room.

388
00:30:23,923 --> 00:30:26,692
His dog got in the room,
got into the marijuana,

389
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,895
Spread it all over the floor.

390
00:30:28,995 --> 00:30:29,695
Wait a minute.

391
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:31,097
His dog got into it?

392
00:30:31,197 --> 00:30:32,164
You've seen his dog.

393
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:34,266
It's the jaws of
Labrador retrievers.

394
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:37,603
One time it ate an entire
rosebush, thorns and all.

395
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:38,905
Imagine having to shit that out.

396
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:40,239
Shit.

397
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:41,874
Well, so what happened?

398
00:30:41,974 --> 00:30:42,942
What do you think happened?

399
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:45,912
Mikey's dad came
home, and there laying

400
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:50,382
On the floor was the dog,
stoned out of its mind.

401
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:51,850
Oh, shit.

402
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:53,685
So what happened then?

403
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:56,322
Oh, Mikey started... Mikey
starts running from his dad.

404
00:30:56,422 --> 00:30:58,157
His dad's chasing
him around the house.

405
00:30:58,257 --> 00:31:00,226
I mean, he's booking like
Tom and fucking Jerry.

406
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:02,761
Or he's running like Speedy
Gonzales on Benzedrine.

407
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:03,862
All right, already.

408
00:31:03,963 --> 00:31:05,097
Christ, enough with
the cartoon metaphors.

409
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,900
Anyway, anyway, Mikey
ended up tripping on his leg

410
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,068
And breaking it.

411
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:11,837
No leg, no Mike,
no ride, no movie.

412
00:31:15,274 --> 00:31:16,342
Hey, Alex.

413
00:31:16,442 --> 00:31:18,344
Yeah?

414
00:31:18,444 --> 00:31:19,912
You drove here, right?

415
00:31:20,012 --> 00:31:22,048
ALEX: Why?

416
00:31:22,148 --> 00:31:23,515
What are you doing after work?

417
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:32,891
I'm telling you,
that's what I read.

418
00:31:32,992 --> 00:31:34,026
Where?

419
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:35,561
In one of those medical
journals, the... the New

420
00:31:35,661 --> 00:31:36,762
England something or other.

421
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:37,796
What did it say?

422
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,365
It said, in one of
the recent studies,

423
00:31:39,465 --> 00:31:40,732
They found eye drops
to be addictive.

424
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:41,800
- Really?
- Yeah.

425
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,135
I'm serious.

426
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:44,937
It said the more eye drops
you use, the quicker your eyes

427
00:31:45,037 --> 00:31:46,205
Dry out, because
of the chemicals.

428
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:47,206
Therefore, the...

429
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:48,440
No, no, no, no, no.

430
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,508
Hence.

431
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:50,309
What?

432
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,111
Hence, not therefore.

433
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:53,512
All right, motherfucker.

434
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:56,415
Hence, the more chemicals your
eyes depend on to remain moist.

435
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:57,216
Therefore...

436
00:31:57,316 --> 00:31:58,117
It has to be a conspiracy.

437
00:31:58,217 --> 00:31:59,251
Therefore.

438
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:01,253
Therefore, the more eye
drops you need to buy.

439
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:04,156
It's a goddamn conspiracy.

440
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,257
You know what?

441
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:06,792
Someone should put a
warning label on that.

442
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:08,827
I mean, no one gives a
shit about that until too

443
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:09,962
Many people are hooked or dead.

444
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:11,163
Lucky cigarettes,
hand to god, it

445
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:12,464
Seemed like the whole
world was smoking

446
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:13,632
Them in the '40s and '50s.

447
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:14,967
Christ, I remember
doctors advertising...

448
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:16,468
W... wait... w...
W... wait a minute.

449
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:18,870
What do you mean, you remember?

450
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:21,507
The '40s and '50s, man, your
mom wasn't even a fetus.

451
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:23,575
He means he remembers
hearing about them.

452
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,711
God, JT, you're
so damn critical.

453
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:27,513
Like that time you made
that kid cry because he

454
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:28,680
Said me instead of I.

455
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,648
So?

456
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:30,949
He was fuckin'
four years old, man.

457
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,418
That's more the point, man.

458
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:34,653
People should say what they
mean and mean what they say.

459
00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:36,055
Do you have any
idea how many people

460
00:32:36,155 --> 00:32:38,924
Come into my store
absolutely convinced

461
00:32:39,025 --> 00:32:41,360
That the word combat
is spelled with a K?

462
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,829
Do you have any idea how many
more people come to my store

463
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:46,198
Absolutely fucking
convinced that showering

464
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:48,167
Is strictly an annual thing?

465
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:51,337
Do you have any idea how many
people come into my store

466
00:32:51,437 --> 00:32:53,839
Not being able to
pronounce the word trilogy?

467
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:54,973
Oh, I'll give you that one.

468
00:32:55,074 --> 00:32:56,508
I mean, no one can
pronounce that damn word.

469
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:58,244
I mean, it's like I
told him, all right?

470
00:32:58,344 --> 00:32:59,845
90% of the world is stupid.

471
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:03,615
The other 10%, me, you...
I don't really know you,

472
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,151
Alex, so I can't really comment.

473
00:33:05,251 --> 00:33:09,421
But me, you, we carry
the rest of everybody.

474
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,723
But you know, it's
a video store, JT.

475
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,059
It's not a government
think tank.

476
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:14,393
Yeah, I gotta go
with Ryan on this one.

477
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:15,961
I mean, don't you think
you're being... I don't know,

478
00:33:16,062 --> 00:33:17,229
Over critical?

479
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,964
I'm not asking that everybody
who comes in the store

480
00:33:19,065 --> 00:33:20,766
Be a fuckin' Final
Jeopardy contestant.

481
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:23,402
I'm just asking that when they
put down a job application

482
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:25,871
On my desk, that A,
they're not pierced so much

483
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:28,207
They look like Pinhead from
fucking Hell Raiser series,

484
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:30,876
And B, when I ask them whether
they speak a foreign language,

485
00:33:30,976 --> 00:33:32,211
The only thing they
put down is they're

486
00:33:32,311 --> 00:33:34,280
Fluent in fucking Klingon, man.

487
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,615
You're not asking too much
if this was a perfect world.

488
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:37,416
Thank you.

489
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:38,550
See?

490
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:43,355
Thing is JT, it's not a
perfect world, you know?

491
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:44,323
Uh-oh.

492
00:33:44,423 --> 00:33:45,124
What?

493
00:33:45,224 --> 00:33:46,192
It's overheating.

494
00:33:46,292 --> 00:33:47,726
Why is it doing that?

495
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:48,727
It's got a leak.

496
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:49,761
It needs a new
radiator, and I thought

497
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:50,629
I'd hold out till payday.

498
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:52,898
Ah, sh... [grunts]

499
00:34:00,406 --> 00:34:02,308
Uh.

500
00:34:02,408 --> 00:34:04,843
We're um... we're stalled.

501
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:06,044
Yeah, thank you, JT.

502
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:22,528
Know anything about cars?

503
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:24,730
Can you fuck a car?

504
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:25,531
I...

505
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:26,898
Can you fuck a car?

506
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,267
No.

507
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:32,171
Then why would I need to
know anything about cars?

508
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:32,971
OK.

509
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,240
What about you?

510
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,842
Do I... do I look like the
owner of Harley's Garage?

511
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,681
All right, come on.

512
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:44,015
Where are we going?

513
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:45,484
I saw a gas station
a few blocks back.

514
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:46,618
We're going to get
some antifreeze

515
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:47,986
And hope the car makes
it to the theater.

516
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:55,327
Did I ever tell you about
the one about the dead bunny?

517
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,996
Yeah, well, this kid's pet bunny
dies, so he gives it to his dad

518
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,298
To bury in the backyard.

519
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:00,732
His dad's like, OK.

520
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,501
Go to school, and I'll have
it buried in the backyard

521
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,436
Before you get home.

522
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:07,139
So the kid goes to school,
and his dad made soup

523
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:11,777
For dinner that night. [Laughs]

524
00:35:11,877 --> 00:35:12,911
Pretty good one, huh?

525
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:17,416
11:15?

526
00:35:17,516 --> 00:35:18,217
Over at the theater?

527
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:19,084
Yeah.

528
00:35:19,185 --> 00:35:20,286
Oh man, I can't wait to see it.

529
00:35:20,386 --> 00:35:22,254
I haven't seen that
in so long, man.

530
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:23,755
Yeah, OK.
Well, I gotta go, man.

531
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:24,656
I've got to lock up.

532
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:25,591
All right?

533
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:26,525
See you there.

534
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:27,326
OK, bye.

535
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:39,638
Hey, look.

536
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:40,906
This will only
take a second, man.

537
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:42,208
I'm sorry, fellas,
but I'm closed.

538
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:43,008
Aw, come on.

539
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:43,942
My car broke down.

540
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:45,110
I just need to get
some antifreeze.

541
00:35:45,211 --> 00:35:46,212
I just closed out my register.

542
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:48,180
I can't ring anybody
up until tomorrow.

543
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,915
I was just about
to lock the door.

544
00:35:50,015 --> 00:35:50,982
Jesus.

545
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:52,318
Nothing I can do for
you until tomorrow.

546
00:35:52,418 --> 00:35:53,118
Oh, Jesus Christ.

547
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:53,985
Come on, man.

548
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:54,820
Sorry.

549
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,555
Oh, we're broke down out there.

550
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,524
Ah.

551
00:35:58,624 --> 00:35:59,791
Sorry, fellas.

552
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:00,659
Come on, man.

553
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,231
Jesus Christ, man.

554
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:06,632
Come on.

555
00:36:06,732 --> 00:36:07,933
Y'all have a good night.

556
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:09,601
Oh, thanks.

557
00:36:09,701 --> 00:36:11,002
Yeah, thanks for
nothing, you goofy

558
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:12,204
Jabba the Hutt motherfucker!

559
00:36:12,304 --> 00:36:14,306
Hey, shut the hell up, JT.

560
00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:15,507
He's just doing his job, man.

561
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:17,543
I've seen you do the
same thing before.

562
00:36:17,643 --> 00:36:18,677
Aw, fuck him, man.

563
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:19,945
He's one of those people
that are so annoying,

564
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:21,813
You think you could
fucking kill him, man.

565
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:22,948
You hear that?

566
00:36:23,048 --> 00:36:25,284
You're just like birds
that shit on your car

567
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:27,085
Five minutes after
you get it washed.

568
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,987
You are at the top
of my list of people

569
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:30,155
To choke the living shit out of.

570
00:36:30,256 --> 00:36:30,956
Will you shut up?

571
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:32,123
Look at that chin, man.

572
00:36:32,224 --> 00:36:33,359
He's a muppet-chin bastard.

573
00:36:33,459 --> 00:36:35,327
You're telling me he doesn't
look like something Jim

574
00:36:35,427 --> 00:36:37,162
Henson created?

575
00:36:37,263 --> 00:36:38,597
That make you feel good, boy?

576
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:39,698
Make you feel superior?

577
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:46,705
I've been made fun of by a
lot worse punks than you.

578
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:50,008
All I know is you're
one mean son of a bitch.

579
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:51,610
I'm just trying to
do my job, mister.

580
00:36:58,484 --> 00:37:01,753
[Bird singing]

581
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:05,156
[Laughter]

582
00:37:05,257 --> 00:37:09,227
Well, that fuckin' bird
read my mind. [Laughs]

583
00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:10,896
Now what the hell
are we supposed to do?

584
00:37:10,996 --> 00:37:12,331
Oh, well, shit,
Stephen Hawking,

585
00:37:12,431 --> 00:37:14,266
I would have thought you'd
have it all figured out by now.

586
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:18,470
I mean, it seems like your
keen intellects are... hey,

587
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,105
Has anyone ever told you
you're a real smart ass?

588
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:20,906
Yeah?

589
00:37:21,006 --> 00:37:21,940
Eat me.

590
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,008
All right.

591
00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:26,612
Hey, Alex, Alex, back
the hell up, man.

592
00:37:26,712 --> 00:37:28,179
What, are you siding with him?

593
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,148
Were you not here
just a minute ago?

594
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,783
He almost got us into
a fight with a guy who

595
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:33,051
Weighed as much as a small jet.

596
00:37:33,151 --> 00:37:35,487
Look, we don't need a
blow-by-blow, all right, man?

597
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:36,288
We were all here.

598
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:38,023
We all know what happened.

599
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:40,125
So what do you say we stop
remembering how we got here

600
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:42,628
And start focusing on a way
to get out of this mess.

601
00:37:46,365 --> 00:37:48,199
Now, where are we?

602
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,668
11 and Grassion.

603
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:50,902
Why?

604
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,604
Because I know somebody
who might help us out.

605
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:07,018
Harrison Ford.

606
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,120
Now, he's a cool guy.

607
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,490
I mean, easily one of my
all-time favorite cinematic

608
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,124
Good guys.

609
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:16,928
I mean, well, he's not...
You know, built, right?

610
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:19,097
But he's decisive.

611
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:20,131
Tough.

612
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:21,567
Fearless.

613
00:38:21,667 --> 00:38:24,836
Harrison Ford said jump, you
said out of which window.

614
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:26,372
I mean, when me and
JT were younger...

615
00:38:26,472 --> 00:38:27,205
No, no.

616
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,240
JT and I. No, no, no, no, no.

617
00:38:29,341 --> 00:38:31,877
Well, when JT and
I were younger,

618
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:34,145
I was actually littler than JT.

619
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:35,847
I mean, I wasn't like an
Oompa Loompa or nothing.

620
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:38,016
But I was kind of small.

621
00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:40,352
So for the longest
time, Harrison Ford

622
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:41,487
Was my role model.

623
00:38:41,587 --> 00:38:42,388
True?

624
00:38:42,488 --> 00:38:43,955
True.

625
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:46,157
I think the thing
I like best though

626
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:47,959
Is the way that
Harrison Ford plays

627
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:50,562
His characters like a badass.

628
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:53,198
But he never acts like a badass.

629
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:54,733
He just is.

630
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,735
And nowadays,
anytime a character

631
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,738
Wants to show you how tough
they are, they... they... they...

632
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:02,374
They spend 12 hours a day in
the gym for a couple of months,

633
00:39:02,474 --> 00:39:05,243
And then they tear their shirts
off within the first act,

634
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,613
Just so they can show
you how bad they are.

635
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:09,481
It is... all this showing off.

636
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:10,716
Look at me.
I'm bad.

637
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:11,517
I'm tough.

638
00:39:11,617 --> 00:39:12,884
Eh, eh.

639
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:15,253
I mean, and then they
do these photo spreads

640
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,555
In these magazines, right?

641
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:18,557
Featuring their
ass and their pecs

642
00:39:18,657 --> 00:39:20,826
And their forearms,
front and center.

643
00:39:20,926 --> 00:39:23,228
Don't these guys
have any pride left?

644
00:39:23,328 --> 00:39:25,464
Christ, you'd never
see Harrison Ford

645
00:39:25,564 --> 00:39:27,599
On the cover of a
magazine with nothing

646
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,367
But a leaf over his schlong.

647
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:31,570
And do you know why?

648
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,839
Because he's got the goods.

649
00:39:33,939 --> 00:39:36,307
He knows it and we know it.

650
00:39:36,408 --> 00:39:39,177
All those pretty boy
actors out there know it.

651
00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:41,647
And he doesn't have to
prove anything to us.

652
00:39:41,747 --> 00:39:42,548
Am I wrong or what?

653
00:39:42,648 --> 00:39:43,348
Oh, no.

654
00:39:43,449 --> 00:39:44,249
You make a valid point.

655
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:45,417
- Yeah?
- Yeah, man.

656
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:46,685
I feel the same way
about Jimmy Dean.

657
00:39:46,785 --> 00:39:47,653
Ooh, Jimmy Dean.

658
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:48,787
That is a good one.

659
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,556
He is a man's man.

660
00:39:50,656 --> 00:39:52,991
So whose house is this
we're going to, anyway?

661
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:55,794
My girlfriend's.

662
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,563
My ex-girlfriend, actually.

663
00:39:57,663 --> 00:39:59,831
What, did she like, kick
you out or something?

664
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:01,967
It's none of your
goddamn concern.

665
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:04,603
Hey, come on, man.

666
00:40:04,703 --> 00:40:06,404
Sorry.

667
00:40:06,505 --> 00:40:10,208
It's a sensitive area, I guess.

668
00:40:10,308 --> 00:40:11,209
That was weird.

669
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:24,122
Hey, hey, hey.

670
00:40:26,725 --> 00:40:28,226
Hey.

671
00:40:28,326 --> 00:40:30,295
Listen man, I'm... I'm
short a couple of bucks.

672
00:40:30,395 --> 00:40:31,697
You guys got any money
I can borrow, huh?

673
00:40:31,797 --> 00:40:32,498
Sorry, fellas.

674
00:40:32,598 --> 00:40:33,298
Can't help you out.

675
00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:36,167
[Laughs] You see this?

676
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:39,004
This can go through a car
door, and it sure as hell

677
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:40,405
Can go through you.

678
00:40:40,506 --> 00:40:41,973
Now, you sure you don't have a
couple of bucks I can borrow,

679
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:43,341
Huh?
Look, just put the knife down.

680
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,043
[Laughs] What?

681
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:46,778
Did you hear what he said?

682
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:48,914
[Laughter]

683
00:40:49,815 --> 00:40:50,782
What'd you say?

684
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:53,118
Put the knife down,
you won't get hurt.

685
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:54,119
[Laughter]

686
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:56,555
[Grunting]

687
00:41:01,527 --> 00:41:06,331
Are you gonna be as
uh... dumb as your friend?

688
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:09,635
Or do you have uh, some
money I can borrow?

689
00:41:09,735 --> 00:41:11,069
Come on.

690
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:13,471
Jack.

691
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:14,305
What?

692
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:15,240
Shit.

693
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,241
Holy shit.

694
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:17,042
Ah!

695
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:20,679
Ah! [Screaming]

696
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:28,119
Ah!

697
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:35,827
You fucking killed them.

698
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:37,495
Look, I know this
looks bad, all right?

699
00:41:37,596 --> 00:41:38,630
You know, I'm not
happy about it.

700
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:39,430
But I had to do it.

701
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:40,231
It was self-defense.

702
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,332
It was kill or be killed.

703
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:42,601
I didn't do this for fun.

704
00:41:42,701 --> 00:41:43,902
I didn't do this for
shits and giggles.

705
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:44,903
I had to do it.

706
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,004
Had I not done it,
you two would have

707
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:47,338
Been dead on a morgue slab.

708
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:49,274
But they fuckin'
stabbed you, man!

709
00:41:49,374 --> 00:41:51,543
Look, there's only two
ways to kill a vampire.

710
00:41:51,643 --> 00:41:53,044
Sunlight and a wooden
stake to the heart.

711
00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:57,616
All that coffins and Bella
Lugosi shit, that shit.

712
00:41:57,716 --> 00:41:58,817
W... wait.

713
00:41:58,917 --> 00:41:59,651
Vam... vampire?

714
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:00,952
Did you say vampire?

715
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:01,920
That's right.

716
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,122
Syllable for
syllable what I said.

717
00:42:04,222 --> 00:42:05,323
That's bullshit, man.

718
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:07,793
If you're a vampire, where
are your fuckin' fangs?

719
00:42:07,893 --> 00:42:08,794
I had them filed down.

720
00:42:08,894 --> 00:42:10,028
I kept biting my lip.
Now, come on.

721
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:10,829
Let's go.

722
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:11,730
Oh no.

723
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:13,264
Prove you're a vampire.

724
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:16,201
I did it to A and
B. Now, come on.

725
00:42:16,301 --> 00:42:19,004
You fucking... if you're worried
about me killing you, don't.

726
00:42:19,104 --> 00:42:21,707
I would have done
that an hour ago.

727
00:42:21,807 --> 00:42:23,274
Look, you gonna come with me?

728
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,643
Or are you going
to wait until A,

729
00:42:24,743 --> 00:42:27,913
The police, or B, some of their
friends find these fuckers?

730
00:42:28,013 --> 00:42:29,380
Well, come on!

731
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,849
Look, he's right, JT.

732
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:32,651
I mean, this isn't the
best neighborhood to be in.

733
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:33,451
[Police sirens]

734
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,221
We're trying something.

735
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:37,689
Don't worry, man.

736
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:39,090
Dude, you're
covered by the best.

737
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,158
You know that.

738
00:42:40,258 --> 00:42:41,860
How many fights have
I gotten in for you?

739
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,394
How many have I won?

740
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:44,395
Huh?

741
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:45,396
Come on.

742
00:43:03,381 --> 00:43:05,717
So she's a vampire too?

743
00:43:05,817 --> 00:43:07,585
Yeah.

744
00:43:07,686 --> 00:43:11,256
How many goddamn
vampires are there?

745
00:43:11,356 --> 00:43:13,825
Let's just say you'd
never sleep if you knew.

746
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:23,368
What?

747
00:43:23,468 --> 00:43:25,103
Are you nervous
or something, man?

748
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:26,237
Why?

749
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:27,505
Because... because you
look like you're going

750
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,907
To have an aneurysm.

751
00:43:29,007 --> 00:43:31,076
Why did you guys break up?

752
00:43:31,176 --> 00:43:32,543
Well, you're going to
find out soon enough,

753
00:43:32,644 --> 00:43:34,212
So I might as well tell you.

754
00:43:34,312 --> 00:43:35,914
Adia left me for another guy.

755
00:43:36,014 --> 00:43:37,816
In fact, you might know him.

756
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:42,654
Jack Daniels.

757
00:43:42,754 --> 00:43:44,022
[Sigh] Wow.

758
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:45,791
If it isn't Travis Bickle.

759
00:43:45,891 --> 00:43:46,792
This is a switch.

760
00:43:46,892 --> 00:43:48,626
Usually I don't get
to see your face.

761
00:43:48,727 --> 00:43:50,662
Usually, it's your breath I hear
on the other end of my phone

762
00:43:50,762 --> 00:43:51,863
At 3:00 in the morning.

763
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:53,364
Oh, that's bullshit.
I haven't done that since...

764
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,165
Since what?

765
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:55,701
Tuesday?

766
00:43:55,801 --> 00:43:56,634
Can we come in?

767
00:43:56,735 --> 00:43:57,869
[Sigh] No.

768
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,370
We're not... we're not
starting that again.

769
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,672
ALEX: Starting what?

770
00:44:00,772 --> 00:44:02,373
Two weeks ago, you
come back claiming

771
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,942
You want your toothpaste.

772
00:44:04,042 --> 00:44:05,143
Fine.

773
00:44:05,243 --> 00:44:07,012
Maybe you're a little
anal about dental hygiene.

774
00:44:07,112 --> 00:44:08,379
Then you come back a
week later, claiming

775
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,514
I have one of your socks?

776
00:44:09,614 --> 00:44:10,648
I'm not buying
this anymore, Alex.

777
00:44:10,749 --> 00:44:11,783
Do yourself a favor.

778
00:44:11,883 --> 00:44:14,652
Get yourself a hobby,
a dog, some Thorazine,

779
00:44:14,753 --> 00:44:16,487
Whatever it takes for you to
realize that this is over.

780
00:44:16,587 --> 00:44:18,123
I don't want you anymore.
No.

781
00:44:18,223 --> 00:44:19,691
What you mean is you
want someone who's

782
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:21,026
Going to sit around and tell
you that being a fucking drunk

783
00:44:21,126 --> 00:44:23,061
Is the greatest thing in the
world, and everything you do

784
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:23,862
Is just perfect.

785
00:44:23,962 --> 00:44:24,896
Get the hell out of here.

786
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:25,897
Come on, look, Courtney Love.

787
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:27,165
I just need some
goddamn antifreeze.

788
00:44:27,265 --> 00:44:28,734
Our car broke down a ways back.

789
00:44:28,834 --> 00:44:30,668
And then I'm out of
your life for good.

790
00:44:30,769 --> 00:44:33,504
You can go back to living this
four star existence of yours.

791
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:35,941
You're lucky as hell
Slain's not awake.

792
00:44:36,041 --> 00:44:36,842
Who's Slain?

793
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:43,982
Do we go in?

794
00:44:44,082 --> 00:44:45,083
I don't know.

795
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,584
I'm not familiar with
vampire etiquette.

796
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,319
I didn't bring my Anne
Rice decoder ring.

797
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:53,959
Well, let's just make
sure we take our shoes off.

798
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:55,093
Eh?

799
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:55,894
Yeah.

800
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:07,806
Who the hell is Slain?

801
00:45:07,906 --> 00:45:08,606
Will you shut up.

802
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:09,941
I'm trying to watch this.

803
00:45:10,041 --> 00:45:11,476
He's your boyfriend, isn't he?

804
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:22,187
OK, I'll take that as a yes.

805
00:45:22,287 --> 00:45:25,757
Look, maybe we should go.

806
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:27,993
Where the hell do you get
off fucking another guy?

807
00:45:28,093 --> 00:45:28,860
You're my girlfriend.

808
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,828
No, Alex.
No.

809
00:45:29,928 --> 00:45:31,162
I was once your girlfriend.

810
00:45:31,262 --> 00:45:32,563
Once being the
operative word, here.

811
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:33,631
I'm not anymore.

812
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:34,966
Oh, once my girlfriend.

813
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:35,834
I see.

814
00:45:35,934 --> 00:45:38,036
Kind of like you
were once sober?

815
00:45:38,136 --> 00:45:41,339
[Scoffs] You still haven't
lost your touch, have you Alex?

816
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:44,976
You still know how to make me
feel like 40 miles of bad road.

817
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,047
We should go.

818
00:45:49,147 --> 00:45:50,715
It's obvious it wasn't
such a hot idea.

819
00:45:50,816 --> 00:45:51,817
And if I'm such
a fucking drunk,

820
00:45:51,917 --> 00:45:53,952
Then why can't you get
over me dumping you?

821
00:45:54,052 --> 00:45:57,856
Uh, take a wild guess.

822
00:45:57,956 --> 00:45:58,857
Oh.

823
00:45:58,957 --> 00:45:59,657
Wait.

824
00:46:03,028 --> 00:46:03,895
Slain's car.

825
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:05,196
Go take it to your car.

826
00:46:05,296 --> 00:46:06,832
Put some antifreeze in it.

827
00:46:06,932 --> 00:46:08,699
Bring it back later.

828
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,001
Be careful of the brakes.

829
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:11,136
They stick every now and again.

830
00:46:11,236 --> 00:46:12,270
Slain won't mind?

831
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:14,405
Slain's not gonna know.

832
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:15,706
He was out late last night.

833
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,810
Barely made it in by dawn.

834
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:20,745
Does he take care of you?

835
00:46:20,846 --> 00:46:23,681
I've come to the
conclusion that no one is

836
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,051
Ever going to take care of me.

837
00:46:26,151 --> 00:46:29,787
But he brings home
blood every night.

838
00:46:29,888 --> 00:46:33,224
He works at a hospital and he
steals blood from the bank.

839
00:46:33,324 --> 00:46:34,960
You know how that goes.

840
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:35,961
Yeah, but is he good to you?

841
00:46:36,061 --> 00:46:37,562
Good enough, I guess.

842
00:46:37,662 --> 00:46:42,167
Kind of depends on his
mood, but... um, look.

843
00:46:42,267 --> 00:46:45,036
I really don't want him
to find you guys in here,

844
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:45,837
So do you think...

845
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:47,772
Yeah, come on guys.

846
00:46:47,873 --> 00:46:48,840
Antifreeze in the garage?

847
00:46:55,346 --> 00:46:56,047
Alex?

848
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:02,888
I'm sorry I don't feel
the same way about...

849
00:48:02,413 --> 00:48:03,714
Christ, man.

850
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:06,484
She shoulda just hooked
herself up to an IV of Absolute

851
00:48:06,584 --> 00:48:08,686
And been done with it.

852
00:48:08,786 --> 00:48:10,221
She made Cage in
"Leaving Las Vegas"

853
00:48:10,321 --> 00:48:12,590
Look like a leading
candidate for rehab.

854
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:14,159
You dated that lush?

855
00:48:16,861 --> 00:48:18,796
She wasn't always like that.

856
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,631
So how long did you two date?

857
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,634
It would have been
31 years next month.

858
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,671
Right after my
first tour in Nam.

859
00:48:26,771 --> 00:48:28,239
In the beginning,
things were great.

860
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:29,274
Better than great.

861
00:48:29,374 --> 00:48:31,776
Things were phenomenal.

862
00:48:31,876 --> 00:48:34,045
Then she starts spiking her
nightly feeds with vodka tonic.

863
00:48:34,145 --> 00:48:37,048
Soon she wouldn't even
want to drink blood.

864
00:48:37,148 --> 00:48:39,384
It became impossible to tell
which one she was more addicted

865
00:48:39,484 --> 00:48:41,319
To, vodka tonic because
she was an alchie,

866
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:43,154
Or blood because she was a vamp.

867
00:48:45,991 --> 00:48:50,295
So you like loved her, huh?

868
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:55,700
So what about you?

869
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,035
Anyone serious?

870
00:48:57,135 --> 00:48:59,137
[Laughs] You're backing the
wrong horse there, Count.

871
00:48:59,237 --> 00:48:59,937
Why?

872
00:49:00,038 --> 00:49:01,139
What do you mean?

873
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:03,774
I haven't exactly had many
of what one could define

874
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:05,443
As serious relationships.

875
00:49:05,543 --> 00:49:07,979
OK, well, how long
do they usually last?

876
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:12,817
[Sigh] Well, mm... 10 hours.

877
00:49:12,917 --> 00:49:13,584
Hours?

878
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:15,653
Did you say hours?

879
00:49:15,753 --> 00:49:17,989
Well, one time I stayed
with this girl for 14 hours,

880
00:49:18,089 --> 00:49:20,591
But that was because she
forgot to set her alarm clock.

881
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:21,726
I hope you're
buckling up, Ryan.

882
00:49:21,826 --> 00:49:22,927
[Groans]

883
00:49:23,028 --> 00:49:24,262
I mean, imagine having to
live forever with AIDS.

884
00:49:24,362 --> 00:49:25,296
Even vamps are scared of that.

885
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:26,797
Yeah, I buckle up.

886
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:29,367
It's just... well, I like sex.

887
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:30,635
What's wrong with that?
Nothing.

888
00:49:30,735 --> 00:49:32,637
I just hope you're not
promising these women anything.

889
00:49:32,737 --> 00:49:33,838
No, no, no, no.

890
00:49:33,938 --> 00:49:36,641
In fact, the way I see
it, I'm giving these women

891
00:49:36,741 --> 00:49:37,942
A valuable lifelong lesson.

892
00:49:38,043 --> 00:49:39,810
How do you figure that?

893
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,912
Look, here's how I see it.

894
00:49:42,013 --> 00:49:43,648
Uh, women don't like to gamble.

895
00:49:43,748 --> 00:49:44,682
Ah, Christ.

896
00:49:44,782 --> 00:49:46,417
They like a safe bet.

897
00:49:46,517 --> 00:49:49,087
They see a good looking
guy like me... now, I'm not

898
00:49:49,187 --> 00:49:50,455
Saying that to be egotistical.
Oh.

899
00:49:50,555 --> 00:49:51,822
I am just stating a
commonly known fact.

900
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:52,990
OK?

901
00:49:53,091 --> 00:49:55,060
And they see me
buying them drinks,

902
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,862
And the little hamster on
the wheel starts turning.

903
00:49:57,962 --> 00:50:00,465
They figure, hey, maybe
if I give this guy

904
00:50:00,565 --> 00:50:01,932
A little something
tonight, he'll

905
00:50:02,033 --> 00:50:03,968
Give me a lot of something
for the rest of my life.

906
00:50:04,069 --> 00:50:06,737
Maybe if I sleep with
this guy tonight,

907
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,906
He'll fall in love with me,
and he'll take care of my ass

908
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,208
Forever.

909
00:50:10,308 --> 00:50:11,942
You follow me so far?

910
00:50:12,043 --> 00:50:12,943
It's a struggle, but yeah.

911
00:50:13,044 --> 00:50:13,878
All right.

912
00:50:13,978 --> 00:50:15,113
Now, you don't
have to be fucking

913
00:50:15,213 --> 00:50:16,747
Prophet to predict that
ain't ever going to happen.

914
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,649
Why is that?

915
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:20,318
Because the way
I see it, no man

916
00:50:20,418 --> 00:50:21,686
Can fall for a
woman who he sleeps

917
00:50:21,786 --> 00:50:24,021
With on their initial meeting,
because he automatically

918
00:50:24,122 --> 00:50:26,757
Assumes that if she'll
sleep with his creepy ass,

919
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:30,128
There might have been hundreds,
even thousands before him.

920
00:50:30,228 --> 00:50:31,962
He figures, fucking
her is like going

921
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,464
To the Secretary of State.

922
00:50:33,564 --> 00:50:35,100
All I've got to do
is pick a number,

923
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,169
And eventually I'll get served.

924
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:42,740
See, I teach women
that they should never,

925
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,210
Under any circumstances,
sleep with someone

926
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:48,746
That they've just met, because
nothing will ever come of it.

927
00:50:48,846 --> 00:50:49,547
Ever.

928
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:54,985
Small price to pay to
teach women that lesson.

929
00:50:55,086 --> 00:51:00,225
I mean, if I gotta be that
guy, then I gotta be that guy.

930
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:05,896
Well, what do you think?

931
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:08,633
Well, I think you
sound like Woody Allen.

932
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:09,700
Oh, how's that?

933
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,136
Well, you'd never be
part of a club that

934
00:51:11,236 --> 00:51:12,303
Would have you as a member.

935
00:51:16,207 --> 00:51:17,041
Aw, shit.

936
00:51:17,142 --> 00:51:18,075

wrong with you, man?

You don't... oh, fuck me!

941
00:52:55,373 --> 00:52:56,507
This guys' a vamp.

942
00:52:56,607 --> 00:52:57,508
What?

943
00:52:57,608 --> 00:53:00,211
Someone staked him
through the heart.

944
00:53:00,311 --> 00:53:02,012
What's your girlfriend
driving around with the body

945
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:03,614
Of a dead vampire in here for?

946
00:53:03,714 --> 00:53:04,615
It's not Adia's car.

947
00:53:04,715 --> 00:53:07,318
It's Slain's.

948
00:53:07,418 --> 00:53:08,118

949
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:09,354
Wait, wait, wait.

Who's Slain?

951
00:53:10,388 --> 00:53:11,356
Her new boyfriend.

952
00:53:11,456 --> 00:53:12,423
Weren't you paying
attention back there?

954
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,046
What's this?

Blood.

956
00:53:40,418 --> 00:53:42,720
It's his vamp blood, type AB.

957
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,955
You can tell all that
just by sniffing it?

958
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,758
Yeah, it's one of our gifts.

959
00:53:47,858 --> 00:53:50,528
This one's labeled B.

960
00:53:50,628 --> 00:53:51,396

962
00:53:54,365 --> 00:53:55,232
These are all vamp blood.

963
00:54:03,841 --> 00:54:06,076
Why the hell would somebody,
if they were a vampire,

964
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:10,281
Want to go around, kill,
and bleed other vampires?

965
00:54:10,381 --> 00:54:11,549
That's not the strange thing.

966
00:54:11,649 --> 00:54:15,453
The strange thing is why
he's storing all their blood.

967
00:54:15,553 --> 00:54:18,022
Well, could it... could it be
like some kind of a drug thing?

968
00:54:18,122 --> 00:54:19,324
Oh my...

969
00:54:19,424 --> 00:54:23,193
No, I mean, like, is... is
vampire blood like cocaine,

970
00:54:23,294 --> 00:54:25,830
Whereas human blood's
like Maxwell House?

971
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:26,831
No, no, no.

972
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:28,098
See, vamp blood
actually tastes worse.

973
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:29,634
The only time we
drink it is when we

974
00:54:29,734 --> 00:54:30,835
Can't get our hands on humans.

975
00:54:30,935 --> 00:54:32,136
OK.

976
00:54:32,236 --> 00:54:33,604
So it's like when you buy
the off brand headache stuff

977
00:54:33,704 --> 00:54:34,905
Because you don't
have the money to buy

978

the house, now.

found a cooler full of vamp

Or at least seriously injured.

1011
00:56:23,614 --> 00:56:25,115
I mean, there were times
that I was saying, man,

1012
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,451
It's better for her
to break up with me.

1013

My life is better without her.

1014

be drying her out

Every night, getting
her out of fights.

1016
00:56:31,756 --> 00:56:33,223

nights I sat around

1017

1018

not my daughter.

the next morning,

I didn't need to ask why.

01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:34,699
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.

1077
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:35,933
He ran off.

1078
01:00:36,033 --> 01:00:37,501
You guys came here, pulling
up here like the guns

1079
01:00:37,601 --> 01:00:39,169
Of the fucking Navarone.

1080
01:00:39,269 --> 01:00:39,970
Fuck!

1081
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:57,507
Paging David Helfgott.

1082
01:02:57,607 --> 01:03:01,411
David Helfgott, you have
a call at the front desk.

1083
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:03,780
Jesus Christ.

1084
01:03:03,881 --> 01:03:07,617
[Scoffs] I mean,
what the fuck, JT?

1085
01:03:11,588 --> 01:03:14,291
[Scoffs] That's...
That's lovely.

1086
01:03:31,008 --> 01:03:33,143
What are you... what
are you looking for?

1087
01:03:33,243 --> 01:03:36,313
Anything that will
help us find him.

1088
01:03:36,413 --> 01:03:37,314
Us?

1089
01:03:37,414 --> 01:03:38,248
Now way.

1090
01:03:38,348 --> 01:03:40,384
What do you... what
do you mean, us?

1091
01:03:40,484 --> 01:03:41,185
Oh, no.

1092
01:03:41,285 --> 01:03:42,286
This whole... no.

1093
01:03:42,386 --> 01:03:44,989
This whole thing has
nothing to do with us.

1094
01:03:45,089 --> 01:03:45,956
What the...

1095
01:03:46,056 --> 01:03:46,756
Alex!

1096
01:03:46,857 --> 01:03:48,092
Take it easy!

1097
01:03:48,192 --> 01:03:50,627
Vampire or no vampire,
you're going to put him down.

1098
01:03:50,727 --> 01:03:51,428
Now!

1099
01:03:56,967 --> 01:03:58,435
Adia is dead because
of what we found out.

1100
01:03:58,535 --> 01:03:59,236
We!

1101
01:04:01,972 --> 01:04:04,708
Now, I don't know what
this lame fucker's up to,

1102
01:04:04,808 --> 01:04:06,376
But if he's willing to
kill his own kind over it,

1103
01:04:06,476 --> 01:04:07,912
You gotta know it was
pretty goddamn serious.

1104
01:04:12,616 --> 01:04:15,419
Look, Alex, I just...
I don't think I'm

1105
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:17,221
Up for this kind of thing.

1106
01:04:17,321 --> 01:04:19,189
Look, I know you
must be floating

1107
01:04:19,289 --> 01:04:20,824
In a lake of our own
piss by about now,

1108
01:04:20,925 --> 01:04:22,726
Judging by what
you've seen tonight.

1109
01:04:22,826 --> 01:04:24,261
And for that, I apologize.

1110
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:25,729
I mean, you wanted a
ride to the movies,

1111
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:27,431
And you got psychotic vampires.

1112
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:29,666
But I gotta tell you,
I'm getting the vibe

1113
01:04:29,766 --> 01:04:33,137
That whatever Slain is up to, he
wants to hurt a lot of people.

1114
01:04:33,237 --> 01:04:35,005
So you're just going to have
to chew some action hero gum

1115
01:04:35,105 --> 01:04:37,441
And rise to the
fucking occasion.

1116
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:38,575
And you're right.

1117
01:04:38,675 --> 01:04:40,810
It shouldn't be up to us.

1118
01:04:40,911 --> 01:04:42,879
Just like that fuckin'
show "Full House" shouldn't

1119
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:43,880
Have ran eight goddamn years.

1120
01:04:43,981 --> 01:04:45,049
And just like Bob
Saget shouldn't

1121
01:04:45,149 --> 01:04:48,485
Be dating Dana fucking Delany.

1122
01:04:48,585 --> 01:04:49,954
Just like I shouldn't
be what I am.

1123
01:04:50,054 --> 01:04:51,655
Just like Adia
shouldn't be dead.

1124
01:04:51,755 --> 01:04:54,591
But she is.

1125
01:04:54,691 --> 01:04:57,294
It's not a perfect world, JT.

1126
01:04:57,394 --> 01:04:59,429
Now is a good as time as any
to start dealing with that.

1127
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,602
People are dying, man.

1128
01:05:05,702 --> 01:05:06,403
All right.

1129
01:05:06,503 --> 01:05:08,505
Christ, I'm in.

1130
01:05:08,605 --> 01:05:10,840
Yeah, me too.

1131
01:05:10,941 --> 01:05:13,610
All right, well, help
me find something.

1132
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:15,512
Start looking around.

1133
01:05:15,612 --> 01:05:16,480
Fucking shit in here.

1134
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:31,795
What the hell's that?

1135
01:05:35,365 --> 01:05:37,834
Diagrams on the most
effective way to bleed someone.

1136
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:38,635
In this case, vamps.

1137
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:42,439
You see this?

1138
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:44,108
This is a list of maps.

1139
01:05:44,208 --> 01:05:46,810
Irwin Gallagher, AB.

1140
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:49,479
Jason Podsiadlik, type
A. David Kraszevski,

1141
01:05:49,579 --> 01:05:52,582
Type B. Marcus Thoel, type O.

1142
01:05:52,682 --> 01:05:53,850
And all the... yeah.

1143
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,685
And all the ones except
Marcus Thoel are checked off.

1144
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:58,022
Yeah, because he hasn't
gotten to Thoel yet.

1145
01:05:58,122 --> 01:06:01,758
The old bottles in the cooler
were... were still empty.

1146
01:06:01,858 --> 01:06:03,893
I'd be willing to bet
major parts of my anatomy

1147
01:06:03,994 --> 01:06:05,862
That's where he's headed, folks.

1148
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,264
Do you know Marcus Thoel?

1149
01:06:07,364 --> 01:06:09,266
Yeah, I've heard of him.

1150
01:06:09,366 --> 01:06:11,701
I mean, then again, vamps have
heard of just about everyone

1151
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:14,371
Somewhere down the line.

1152
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:16,240
You ever hear of Slain?

1153
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:18,208
No.

1154
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:20,710
So if you don't know him, how
are we going to find this guy?

1155
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:23,147
I mean, it's not like you can
go to your local vampire hangout

1156
01:06:23,247 --> 01:06:25,249
And ask around to see
if anybody knows him.

1157
01:06:27,884 --> 01:06:30,654
Actually, it's a lot like that.

1158
01:06:51,608 --> 01:06:52,309
Here?

1159
01:06:52,409 --> 01:06:53,310
Yup.

1160
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:55,445
Jeez.

1161
01:06:55,545 --> 01:06:56,246
Shit.

1162
01:06:59,316 --> 01:07:00,717
Password.

1163
01:07:00,817 --> 01:07:02,486
Oldman.

1164
01:07:02,586 --> 01:07:03,753
Alex?

1165
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:04,788
Shit.

1166
01:07:04,888 --> 01:07:06,456
I didn't expect to
see you around here.

1167
01:07:06,556 --> 01:07:09,059
You usually get yours delivered.

1168
01:07:09,159 --> 01:07:10,860
Yeah, well, you know what
they say about first times.

1169
01:08:12,289 --> 01:08:13,690
My god.

1170
01:08:13,790 --> 01:08:15,359
It's Bram Stoker's Cheers.

1171
01:08:20,764 --> 01:08:22,366
[Inaudible] JT.

1172
01:08:22,466 --> 01:08:24,501
Don't piss anybody off
in here, or else you just

1173
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:25,902
Might get to see your spine.

1174
01:08:26,002 --> 01:08:26,903
Get the picture?

1175
01:08:49,893 --> 01:08:53,697
Well, I'll be a little,
skinny soppy's uncle.

1176
01:08:53,797 --> 01:08:57,033
[Scoffs] I never thought to
see you standing by in my bar,

1177
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:59,903
There, Mr. Leery.

1178
01:09:00,003 --> 01:09:02,539
Well?

1179
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:03,740
What can I get for you?

1180
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:05,942
Um, what's fresh?

1181
01:09:06,042 --> 01:09:07,844
Well, we've got a whole
bunch of O negative

1182
01:09:07,944 --> 01:09:09,813
That came from an accident
down on Woodward Avenue,

1183
01:09:09,913 --> 01:09:13,650
And actually, I've got some
A that I got at a blood bank

1184
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:16,420
Over at the uh... Red Cross.

1185
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:20,023
Everything else, day old.

1186
01:09:20,123 --> 01:09:21,225
Give me a large O.

1187
01:09:21,325 --> 01:09:22,392
On the rocks or warm?

1188
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:23,193
Warm.

1189
01:09:23,293 --> 01:09:25,595
How about for your friends?

1190
01:09:25,695 --> 01:09:27,464
Oh, ha, we're
trying to cut back.

1191
01:09:27,564 --> 01:09:28,265
Thanks.

1192
01:09:36,072 --> 01:09:37,040
There you are.

1193
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:38,875
Hey, can I talk to
you if you have time?

1194
01:09:38,975 --> 01:09:40,210
Yeah, OK.

1195
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:41,645
Let me just take care of these
guys that just walked in.

1196
01:09:41,745 --> 01:09:43,046
I'll be right back in a minute.
Yeah, all right.

1197
01:09:43,146 --> 01:09:43,847
I'll be here.

1198
01:09:46,483 --> 01:09:47,784
So.

1199
01:09:47,884 --> 01:09:50,153
So this is... this
is how you do it.

1200
01:09:50,254 --> 01:09:52,689
I mean, you know, this
is how you stay alive?

1201
01:09:52,789 --> 01:09:54,791
Yeah, most of the time.

1202
01:09:54,891 --> 01:09:58,094
What about the
rest of the time?

1203
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:00,163
Look, if you're asking whether
I've killed people to stay

1204
01:10:00,264 --> 01:10:01,798
Alive, the answer is yes.

1205
01:10:01,898 --> 01:10:03,800
But the people I have killed
were all sex offenders

1206
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:04,701
And murderers and worse.

1207
01:10:04,801 --> 01:10:05,535
OK?

1208
01:10:05,635 --> 01:10:07,504
Does that ease your conscience?

1209
01:10:07,604 --> 01:10:10,940
Well, maybe about you, but what
about everybody else in here?

1210
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,309
ALEX: That's their business.

1211
01:10:12,409 --> 01:10:13,677
Wait, wait.

1212
01:10:13,777 --> 01:10:16,646
So everybody in here could be
killing innocent people, just

1213
01:10:16,746 --> 01:10:18,682
Random guys, like
me and JT, and you

1214
01:10:18,782 --> 01:10:21,418
Don't have a problem with that?

1215
01:10:21,518 --> 01:10:23,453
What's so funny?

1216
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:25,154
Look, let me tell you a story.

1217
01:10:25,255 --> 01:10:26,556
This man is trapped
in the middle

1218
01:10:26,656 --> 01:10:28,392
Of the desert with this other
guy, and this guy's a stranger.

1219
01:10:28,492 --> 01:10:29,826
A guy you couldn't
pick out of a lineup.

1220
01:10:29,926 --> 01:10:31,361
They are both... they've
been walking for days,

1221
01:10:31,461 --> 01:10:33,330
And both men know that
they're going to die.

1222
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:35,832
And one day, when they're
dehydrating near death,

1223
01:10:35,932 --> 01:10:37,033
This figure appears.

1224
01:10:37,133 --> 01:10:38,868
I mean, Christ, Moses,
Charlton Heston.

1225
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:39,836
Whatever.

1226
01:10:39,936 --> 01:10:41,571
And this figure
kills the first guy.

1227
01:10:41,671 --> 01:10:44,874
I will lead you out of the
desert, and you can live,

1228
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:47,977
And all you have to do is
kill the stranger next to you.

1229
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:49,646
My question to you
is what do you do?

1230
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:51,080
Do you die for the
stranger next to you,

1231
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:53,617
Who would probably kill you if
he had the same opportunity?

1232
01:10:53,717 --> 01:10:55,619
Would you kill him
to save yourself?

1233
01:10:55,719 --> 01:10:56,553
That's different.

1234
01:10:56,653 --> 01:10:57,354
ALEX: How?

1235
01:10:57,454 --> 01:10:58,322
That's necessary.

1236
01:10:58,422 --> 01:11:00,189
ALEX: For what, survival?

1237
01:11:00,290 --> 01:11:03,327
For us, killing is sometimes
necessary for survival.

1238
01:11:03,427 --> 01:11:05,094
Now, while I don't agree
with the practice of killing

1239
01:11:05,194 --> 01:11:07,331
Innocent people, I'm not
going to stand in the way

1240
01:11:07,431 --> 01:11:11,301
Of the survival of a vamp.

1241
01:11:11,401 --> 01:11:13,202
Wait, so that's
how you justify it?

1242
01:11:13,303 --> 01:11:14,270
All right, look.

1243
01:11:14,371 --> 01:11:15,939
I can't speak for all
the vamps in here,

1244
01:11:16,039 --> 01:11:17,541
But I can say the
ones I've encountered,

1245
01:11:17,641 --> 01:11:19,142
They don't like to
kill innocent people.

1246
01:11:19,242 --> 01:11:20,544
It's usually their last choice.

1247
01:11:20,644 --> 01:11:22,412
But while they don't like
killing, they sure as hell

1248
01:11:22,512 --> 01:11:24,147
Don't like dying.

1249
01:11:24,247 --> 01:11:26,616
So do you like it?

1250
01:11:26,716 --> 01:11:32,522
Do you like being a... a vampire?

1251
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:34,223
Well, I don't
suppose it's something

1252
01:11:34,324 --> 01:11:37,627
Anybody likes, unless they're
stupid or crazy or in denial.

1253
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:42,231
But I can say I've
honestly come to accept it.

1254
01:11:42,332 --> 01:11:43,667
What about other ones?

1255
01:11:43,767 --> 01:11:45,001
I don't know.

1256
01:11:45,101 --> 01:11:46,470
Each one... each one has their
own way of coping with it.

1257
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:48,738
I mean, some, like Adia, drink
their way into acceptance.

1258
01:11:48,838 --> 01:11:50,139
Others go fucking crazy.

1259
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:53,710
And then there's others that
just find healthy ways to cope.

1260
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:54,678
RYAN: Like how?

1261
01:11:54,778 --> 01:11:56,079
Support groups.

1262
01:11:56,179 --> 01:11:57,246
Get the hell out of here.

1263
01:11:57,347 --> 01:11:58,515
ALEX: No, I'm serious.

1264
01:11:58,615 --> 01:12:00,016
Every Mondays and Wednesdays,
here in the basement.

1265
01:12:00,116 --> 01:12:03,086
Have you ever gone?

1266
01:12:03,186 --> 01:12:04,454
No.

1267
01:12:04,554 --> 01:12:06,690
Any particular reason?

1268
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:09,426
Probably the same reason why
I don't like coming in here.

1269
01:12:09,526 --> 01:12:11,695
JT: Which is?

1270
01:12:11,795 --> 01:12:13,463
Whenever I come in
here, I'm constantly

1271
01:12:13,563 --> 01:12:15,264
Reminded by everything
I see of what I am.

1272
01:12:15,365 --> 01:12:16,666
I mean, there are
times I just don't

1273
01:12:16,766 --> 01:12:17,734
Want to be reminded of that.

1274
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:19,168
There are times I
just want to pretend,

1275
01:12:19,268 --> 01:12:22,005
Just for a little while, that
I'm just like everybody else.

1276
01:12:27,243 --> 01:12:28,578
Hey Alex, what's up?

1277
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:30,880
Got some bad news, Tommy.

1278
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:32,181
Adia was killed tonight.

1279
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:33,149
Oh, Alex.

1280
01:12:33,249 --> 01:12:34,984
I'm sorry.

1281
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:37,387
Well, I mean, I... I know
things weren't going really

1282
01:12:37,487 --> 01:12:39,423
Good for you two at
the end, but I know

1283
01:12:39,523 --> 01:12:41,725
You really cared about her.

1284
01:12:41,825 --> 01:12:43,326
So... so who did this?

1285
01:12:43,427 --> 01:12:45,962
I mean, I'll go out and I'll rip
that fucker's heart out myself,

1286
01:12:46,062 --> 01:12:46,763
You know?

1287
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:47,564
I mean...

1288
01:12:47,664 --> 01:12:48,598
It's not that simple, Tommy.

1289
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:50,634
She wasn't killed by a human.

1290
01:12:50,734 --> 01:12:53,036
She was killed by another vamp.

1291
01:12:53,136 --> 01:12:55,572
A vamp killing another vamp?

1292
01:12:55,672 --> 01:12:58,808
Oh, what the fuck is
going on with our world?

1293
01:12:58,908 --> 01:13:01,110
I mean, jeez, who did this?

1294
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:01,911
I don't know.

1295
01:13:02,011 --> 01:13:03,012
Slain something or other.

1296
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:03,947
Her boyfriend.

1297
01:13:04,047 --> 01:13:05,181
You know anybody by that name?

1298
01:13:05,281 --> 01:13:06,015
No, no.

1299
01:13:06,115 --> 01:13:07,083
I don't know anybody like that.

1300
01:13:07,183 --> 01:13:08,217
Oh, well.

1301
01:13:08,317 --> 01:13:09,385
Just keep your ears to
the tracks, all right?

1302
01:13:09,486 --> 01:13:10,286
TOMMY: Yeah, yeah.

1303
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:11,087
I can do that for you.

1304
01:13:11,187 --> 01:13:13,690
Hey, is uh... is Clyde here?

1305
01:13:13,790 --> 01:13:14,824
You want to see Clyde?

1306
01:13:14,924 --> 01:13:16,493
Well, not especially,
but he knows everybody.

1307
01:13:16,593 --> 01:13:17,894
Well, yeah.

1308
01:13:17,994 --> 01:13:19,696
He... after... he came in after
the game, about 15 minutes ago.

1309
01:13:19,796 --> 01:13:22,432
He should be down by the back.

1310
01:13:22,532 --> 01:13:23,633
Thanks, Tommy.

1311
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:29,238
TOMMY: Hey, uh, Alex, I'm
really sorry about Adia.

1312
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:37,714
Watch it.

1313
01:13:37,814 --> 01:13:38,748
I'm sorry.

1314
01:13:38,848 --> 01:13:40,316
Yeah, well, watch
where you're... Ryan?

1315
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:41,284
Is that you?

1316
01:13:43,887 --> 01:13:44,588
Uh, yeah.

1317
01:13:51,294 --> 01:13:55,899
You don't even
remember me, do you?

1318
01:13:55,999 --> 01:13:56,733
No, I don't.

1319
01:13:56,833 --> 01:13:58,902
I should have expected as much.

1320
01:13:59,002 --> 01:14:02,138
I slept with you.

1321
01:14:02,238 --> 01:14:03,106
What?

1322
01:14:03,206 --> 01:14:03,907
When?

1323
01:14:04,007 --> 01:14:05,208
A month ago.

1324
01:14:05,308 --> 01:14:06,375
You slept with a vampire?

1325
01:14:06,476 --> 01:14:08,177
You never told me about that.

1326
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,613
Look, not now, JT.

1327
01:14:09,713 --> 01:14:12,081
Because he didn't know
that I was a vampire.

1328
01:14:12,181 --> 01:14:15,451
The club was dark, and we both
had a few too many drinks.

1329
01:14:15,552 --> 01:14:16,886
Didn't we, Ryan?

1330
01:14:16,986 --> 01:14:18,855
You remember what you
told me, don't you?

1331
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:21,190
You said we were going to date.

1332
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:23,827
You said we were going to
get together that Tuesday.

1333
01:14:23,927 --> 01:14:25,194
That's a fucking quote.

1334
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,263
Look, I thought you said you
never lied to these girls.

1335
01:14:27,363 --> 01:14:28,665
You said you never
promised them anything.

1336
01:14:28,765 --> 01:14:30,700
You really picked the wrong
girl to change your policy on.

1337
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,637
You know, I could have handled
it if you would have just told

1338
01:14:33,737 --> 01:14:35,672
Me it was a one night stand.

1339
01:14:35,772 --> 01:14:38,474
I like sex as much
as the next girl.

1340
01:14:38,575 --> 01:14:40,510
You know why I didn't
bite you that night?

1341
01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:42,411
Because I liked you.

1342
01:14:42,512 --> 01:14:45,481
I liked you and I didn't
want to see you become this.

1343
01:14:45,582 --> 01:14:47,617
But after what you
did that next morning,

1344
01:14:47,717 --> 01:14:50,453
You sneaking out of my house
like a goddamn cat burglar

1345
01:14:50,554 --> 01:14:54,257
Before the sun was even up,
I thought about finding you,

1346
01:14:54,357 --> 01:14:56,660
And I thought about
killing you or biting you.

1347
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:59,095
I hadn't decided which one,
but you can bet your ass

1348
01:14:59,195 --> 01:15:00,363
I wanted to do something.

1349
01:15:00,463 --> 01:15:02,231
I was up nights
thinking about it.

1350
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:04,668
I thought maybe if I
did that, you'd know

1351
01:15:04,768 --> 01:15:06,169
How I felt that next morning.

1352
01:15:06,269 --> 01:15:10,674
How fucking betrayed I felt.
But then I got to thinking,

1353
01:15:10,774 --> 01:15:13,577
How many other women
have you done this to?

1354
01:15:13,677 --> 01:15:16,613
How many other women have
you slept with 34 seconds

1355
01:15:16,713 --> 01:15:18,181
After meeting them?

1356
01:15:18,281 --> 01:15:21,384
Your Rolodex is the
goddamn yellow pages.

1357
01:15:21,484 --> 01:15:24,387
I didn't want one of the 108
diseases you probably have

1358
01:15:24,487 --> 01:15:26,455
And be forced to
live forever with it.

1359
01:15:26,556 --> 01:15:28,091
I didn't want to get sick.

1360
01:15:28,191 --> 01:15:29,325
Not over you.

1361
01:15:29,425 --> 01:15:31,160
You're just not worth
getting sick over.

1362
01:15:37,667 --> 01:15:39,202
Yeah, maybe you
should go wait outside.

1363
01:15:39,302 --> 01:15:40,604
We don't want any
trouble with these guys.

1364
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:03,492
Leaving alone?

1365
01:16:03,593 --> 01:16:04,994
What?

1366
01:16:05,094 --> 01:16:09,065
Well, I just figured a good
looking guy like you might

1367
01:16:09,165 --> 01:16:10,566
Be going home with somebody.

1368
01:16:10,667 --> 01:16:13,569
[Chuckles] No.

1369
01:16:13,670 --> 01:16:14,570
Not tonight.

1370
01:16:41,497 --> 01:16:43,099
You know, she's right, asshole.

1371
01:16:45,735 --> 01:16:46,636
It's all shit.

1372
01:16:50,039 --> 01:17:34,383
[Sigh]

1373
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:36,185
You realize that
you've single-handedly

1374
01:17:36,285 --> 01:17:38,521
Shattered the stereotype that
homosexuals are thin and neat.

1375
01:17:41,791 --> 01:17:43,392
Well, well, well.

1376
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:44,627
Senator Leary.

1377
01:17:44,728 --> 01:17:46,362
To what do I owe this honor?

1378
01:17:46,462 --> 01:17:47,764
Senator?

1379
01:17:47,864 --> 01:17:49,632
Don't worry, he
calls everybody names.

1380
01:17:49,733 --> 01:17:51,801
He thinks it's clever.

1381
01:17:51,901 --> 01:17:53,837
Well, can we sit?

1382
01:17:53,937 --> 01:17:54,637
Free country.

1383
01:18:02,311 --> 01:18:03,780
So who's your friend?

1384
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:08,952
He's kind of cute, even
if he isn't a vamp.

1385
01:18:09,052 --> 01:18:12,488
Of course, I can change that.

1386
01:18:12,588 --> 01:18:14,657
I'm gonna go sit at the bar.

1387
01:18:14,758 --> 01:18:15,458
OK.

1388
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:21,097
Is that guy a mortal?

1389
01:18:21,197 --> 01:18:21,898
Yeah.

1390
01:18:21,998 --> 01:18:23,666
Never ceases to amaze me.

1391
01:18:23,767 --> 01:18:25,568
What?

1392
01:18:25,668 --> 01:18:27,503
He knew that I could rip out
his throat in half a second,

1393
01:18:27,603 --> 01:18:29,873
But he wasn't scared.

1394
01:18:29,973 --> 01:18:32,308
He wasn't scared of the
fact that I'm a vamp.

1395
01:18:32,408 --> 01:18:34,677
He's scared of the
fact that I'm gay.

1396
01:18:34,778 --> 01:18:36,780
I can't understand
that about you guys.

1397
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,348
You straight men think that
if you come within 100 yards

1398
01:18:39,448 --> 01:18:42,185
Of a gay man, the next
morning, you'll simply wake up

1399
01:18:42,285 --> 01:18:42,986
And you'll be a queer.

1400
01:18:43,086 --> 01:18:43,787
It's just balls.

1401
01:18:43,887 --> 01:18:45,454
I'll tell you why not.

1402
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:46,655
No halfway for you.

1403
01:18:46,756 --> 01:18:48,391
You're not gonna say
you're bi or experimenting.

1404
01:18:48,491 --> 01:18:50,059
You're just...

1405
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:50,894
Bi.

1406
01:18:50,994 --> 01:18:52,428
What a fucking joke.

1407
01:18:52,528 --> 01:18:54,764
Bisexual people are people
that can't get their asses

1408
01:18:54,864 --> 01:18:57,033
Off the fucking fence.

1409
01:18:57,133 --> 01:18:58,835
Saying that you're
bi is like saying you

1410
01:18:58,935 --> 01:19:00,970
Aren't Democrat or Republican.

1411
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:03,039
Or like the people that stand
in the fucking grocery line

1412
01:19:03,139 --> 01:19:04,941
For 20 fucking minutes,
trying to decide

1413
01:19:05,041 --> 01:19:07,510
Between paper or plastic.

1414
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:11,981
Bisexual is a synonym
for indecisive asshole.

1415
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:13,850
So who won the game?

1416
01:19:13,950 --> 01:19:15,318
Milwaukee.

1417
01:19:15,418 --> 01:19:17,253
Detroit finally makes
it to the playoffs,

1418
01:19:17,353 --> 01:19:19,688
And now they decide to put
in the unproven reliever

1419
01:19:19,789 --> 01:19:21,590
Two days out from the minors.

1420
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:23,259
Somebody there is having
stupid sandwiches,

1421
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:26,095
And that's for damn sure.

1422
01:19:26,195 --> 01:19:29,065
What did you do to your teeth?

1423
01:19:29,165 --> 01:19:30,699
I had them filed down.

1424
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:31,835
Figures.

1425
01:19:31,935 --> 01:19:33,236
What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

1426
01:19:33,336 --> 01:19:34,503
What it means,
Senator, is you're not

1427
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:35,805
Living your life to
the full accordance

1428
01:19:35,905 --> 01:19:37,473
Of the facts of your existence.

1429
01:19:37,573 --> 01:19:39,608
Look, I didn't ask
you to make me a vamp.

1430
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:42,178
Whether you did or didn't
is a moot fucking point.

1431
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:44,580
You are one, so act like one.

1432
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:46,682
Vamps don't associate
with mortals

1433
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:49,552
Or hold down jobs or
file their fangs down.

1434
01:19:49,652 --> 01:19:51,320
Look, I didn't come here
to listen to you tell me

1435
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:53,722
What I should and should not do
with this so-called funny life

1436
01:19:53,823 --> 01:19:54,790
Of mine.

1437
01:19:54,891 --> 01:19:55,992
Then what the hell
did you come here for?

1438
01:19:56,092 --> 01:19:59,028
Put me on the Guilt
Express for turning you?

1439
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:02,498
Senator, that foxhole was
surrounded by Germans.

1440
01:20:02,598 --> 01:20:04,834
And if I hadn't intervened,
you'd be nothing more

1441
01:20:04,934 --> 01:20:06,302
But a toe with a tag on it.

1442
01:20:06,402 --> 01:20:07,203
Intervened?

1443
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:08,804
I saved your life, Senator.

1444
01:20:08,905 --> 01:20:09,605
You would have died.

1445
01:20:09,705 --> 01:20:10,739
Yeah, I did die.

1446
01:20:13,576 --> 01:20:16,079
Single teardrop
rolling down my cheek.

1447
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:25,788
Another vamp
killed Adia tonight.

1448
01:20:30,359 --> 01:20:31,260
What can I do?

1449
01:20:55,251 --> 01:20:56,285
Hi, what's your name?

1450
01:20:59,088 --> 01:21:01,824
Joseph, but people call me JT.

1451
01:21:01,925 --> 01:21:05,061
What's a mortal like you
doing in a place like this?

1452
01:21:05,161 --> 01:21:06,996
This is a joke, right?

1453
01:21:07,096 --> 01:21:08,097
What?

1454
01:21:08,197 --> 01:21:10,733
Your friends put you
up to this, didn't they?

1455
01:21:10,833 --> 01:21:11,734
What?

1456
01:21:11,834 --> 01:21:13,970
You don't think I
know how it goes?

1457
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:14,837
I know what happened.

1458
01:21:14,938 --> 01:21:16,239
Your friends put you up to this.

1459
01:21:16,339 --> 01:21:17,640
Your friends told
you to come over

1460
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:20,243
To this guy who looks like he
weighs four and a half pounds,

1461
01:21:20,343 --> 01:21:22,678
Is balding, and looks
like the bastard child

1462
01:21:22,778 --> 01:21:26,015
Of the leprechaun on the
front of the Lucky Charms box.

1463
01:21:26,115 --> 01:21:27,083
What?

1464
01:21:27,183 --> 01:21:29,485
You don't think this
has happened before?

1465
01:21:29,585 --> 01:21:31,620
You don't think
I know your game?

1466
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:32,555
I know what you're thinking.

1467
01:21:32,655 --> 01:21:33,990
I know what women think of me.

1468
01:21:34,090 --> 01:21:35,524
I know what everybody
thinks of me, all right?

1469
01:21:35,624 --> 01:21:36,892
I'm an asshole.

1470
01:21:36,993 --> 01:21:38,427
I'm an overcritical asshole.

1471
01:21:38,527 --> 01:21:41,130
I don't need to
be reminded of it.

1472
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:43,399
So why don't you just go
back to your vampire buddies,

1473
01:21:43,499 --> 01:21:44,833
Because you ain't going
to get the reaction

1474
01:21:44,934 --> 01:21:46,269
You're looking for out of me.

1475
01:21:50,706 --> 01:21:52,275
You don't give
yourself enough credit.

1476
01:21:55,111 --> 01:21:57,046
I don't give anyone
enough credit.

1477
01:21:57,146 --> 01:21:58,481
At least I'm consistent.

1478
01:22:01,284 --> 01:22:04,020
ALEX: So you've never
heard of a guy named Slain?

1479
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:04,820
CLYDE: No.

1480
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:05,989
And I know everyone.

1481
01:22:06,089 --> 01:22:07,456
You sure he's a vamp?

1482
01:22:07,556 --> 01:22:10,759
Yeah, his fangs were
an inch from my face.

1483
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:12,028
Man, he's got to be new.

1484
01:22:12,128 --> 01:22:13,062
I mean, really new.

1485
01:22:13,162 --> 01:22:14,930
Like, two months.

1486
01:22:15,031 --> 01:22:18,301
What about a guy
named Marcus Thoel?

1487
01:22:18,401 --> 01:22:19,702
Marc?
Oh, yeah.

1488
01:22:19,802 --> 01:22:20,970
I know Marc.

1489
01:22:21,070 --> 01:22:23,172
Me and him used to run
together during the Civil War.

1490
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:25,241
Man, I haven't seen
him in a long time.

1491
01:22:25,341 --> 01:22:27,043
You know, he used to come
in here all the time.

1492
01:22:27,143 --> 01:22:29,678
He helped me open up this place.

1493
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:31,247
Man, me and Marc used to
talk about how we were

1494
01:22:31,347 --> 01:22:32,381
Going to dust this fucking...

1495
01:22:32,481 --> 01:22:34,550
Clyde... look, you
obviously have me mistaken

1496
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:35,918
With someone who gives a shit.

1497
01:22:36,019 --> 01:22:38,521
Do you have his address?

1498
01:22:38,621 --> 01:22:39,555
Yeah.

1499
01:22:39,655 --> 01:22:40,356
Somewhere.

1500
01:22:46,262 --> 01:22:48,831
Man, I really do need to
go through this more often.

1501
01:22:48,931 --> 01:22:53,936
William Howard Taft, Pyotr
Tchaikovsky, William Tell.

1502
01:22:54,037 --> 01:22:54,903
Marcus Thoel.

1503
01:22:59,542 --> 01:23:00,243
Thanks.

1504
01:23:03,746 --> 01:23:06,182
You know, Senator, you could
come around here a little

1505
01:23:06,282 --> 01:23:08,584
More often.

1506
01:23:08,684 --> 01:23:09,585
I miss you.

1507
01:23:14,657 --> 01:23:16,559
[Knocking]

1508
01:23:20,629 --> 01:23:22,031
What, nobody's home?

1509
01:23:30,606 --> 01:23:31,974
Let's go around back.

1510
01:24:13,416 --> 01:24:15,184
All right, I'm going
to check downstairs.

1511
01:24:15,284 --> 01:24:16,185
You check the upstairs.

1512
01:24:16,285 --> 01:24:18,854
Why don't you check over there.

1513
01:24:18,954 --> 01:24:20,856
Look, if you see something,
don't be like Bruce Willis,

1514
01:24:20,956 --> 01:24:21,857
All right?
Just scream.

1515
01:25:47,310 --> 01:25:48,010
Ooh!

1516
01:26:05,027 --> 01:26:08,096
Oh, fuck.

1517
01:26:08,197 --> 01:26:08,897
Fuck.

1518
01:26:13,202 --> 01:26:13,902
Ah!

1519
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:14,903
Fuck!

1520
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:15,704
Fuck!

1521
01:26:24,146 --> 01:26:25,281
Jesus Christ.

1522
01:26:25,381 --> 01:26:26,815
What the... oh, man.

1523
01:26:26,915 --> 01:26:27,616
Oh.

1524
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,432
What the hell is this?

1525
01:26:49,938 --> 01:26:53,376
It's part of his ear.

1526
01:26:53,476 --> 01:26:55,678
Could things get
any more repulsive?

1527
01:26:55,778 --> 01:26:56,479
I mean, honestly.

1528
01:26:56,579 --> 01:26:57,713
All right?

1529
01:26:57,813 --> 01:26:59,915
I feel like an editor on
the "Faces of Death" movie.

1530
01:27:00,015 --> 01:27:02,585
I'm going to go wash
my hands and vomit.

1531
01:27:02,685 --> 01:27:04,019
I'll be right back.

1532
01:27:10,359 --> 01:27:12,094
It's a note.

1533
01:27:12,194 --> 01:27:13,095
What does it say?

1534
01:27:16,599 --> 01:27:17,933
He started it.

1535
01:27:23,906 --> 01:27:26,041
This is the vamp
that turned Slain.

1536
01:27:26,141 --> 01:27:27,876
This is Slain's revenge.

1537
01:27:27,976 --> 01:27:30,012
Uh, how do you know that?

1538
01:27:30,112 --> 01:27:31,747
Because this guy was tortured.

1539
01:27:31,847 --> 01:27:34,016
Look, his eyes are
crazy glued shut.

1540
01:27:34,116 --> 01:27:36,051
Paper cuts on his face.

1541
01:27:36,151 --> 01:27:37,586
The Mike Tyson ear job.

1542
01:27:37,686 --> 01:27:39,688
The fact that he was beaten
severely, all before he

1543
01:27:39,788 --> 01:27:40,989
Was staked.

1544
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:42,525
The guy we found in the car
wasn't anything like this.

1545
01:27:42,625 --> 01:27:45,661
That was more professional,
more methodical.

1546
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:49,465
This, this is the work
of a fuckin' psychopath.

1547
01:27:52,835 --> 01:27:55,338
Oh, that's Slain, all right.

1548
01:27:55,438 --> 01:27:57,272
The IV marks are
still in his arm.

1549
01:27:59,942 --> 01:28:01,944
This seems much more
personal, you know?

1550
01:28:02,044 --> 01:28:04,713
I mean, every vamp goes through
a stage where they want to kill

1551
01:28:04,813 --> 01:28:06,214
The vamp that turned them.

1552
01:28:06,315 --> 01:28:07,783
And this guy just acted
on that fucking impulse

1553
01:28:07,883 --> 01:28:10,252
To the tenth fucking power.

1554
01:28:10,353 --> 01:28:13,021
The guy we found in the trunk
didn't look anything like this.

1555
01:28:17,059 --> 01:28:18,427
So what do you think?

1556
01:28:22,931 --> 01:28:27,836
It's type O. That's
the type he needed.

1557
01:28:27,936 --> 01:28:29,137
And obviously, he's been bled.

1558
01:28:33,642 --> 01:28:34,743
I still don't get it.

1559
01:28:34,843 --> 01:28:36,712
But why?

1560
01:28:36,812 --> 01:28:38,547
Why is he bleeding vampires?

1561
01:29:00,569 --> 01:29:01,437
Thank you.

1562
01:29:09,077 --> 01:29:11,680
Why store vamp blood?

1563
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:13,248
There's gotta be something
we're overlooking.

1564
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:14,850
No, you're not overlooking
anything, Count.

1565
01:29:14,950 --> 01:29:15,651
All right?

1566
01:29:15,751 --> 01:29:16,619
They guy's a fuckin' psycho.

1567
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:17,820
All right?

1568
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:19,722
And psychos, they don't
need reasons for anything.

1569
01:29:19,822 --> 01:29:21,657
I read this one
story, true story,

1570
01:29:21,757 --> 01:29:23,759
Where this guy was
cutting off people's dicks

1571
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:25,127
And serving them
in hot dog buns.

1572
01:29:28,397 --> 01:29:30,799
Yeah, I'm done eating.

1573
01:29:30,899 --> 01:29:31,934
I gotta go take a shit.

1574
01:29:32,034 --> 01:29:32,735
Oh, duly noted.

1575
01:29:32,835 --> 01:29:34,136
I'll call the Times.

1576
01:29:34,236 --> 01:29:36,338
[Laughs] Yeah, you fucker.

1577
01:29:39,742 --> 01:29:41,544
How the hell can you be
friends with that asshole?

1578
01:29:41,644 --> 01:29:42,978
Come on, man.
He's drunk right now.

1579
01:29:43,078 --> 01:29:43,779
Give him a break.

1580
01:29:43,879 --> 01:29:45,080
No, that's no excuse.

1581
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:47,082
He's been an overcritical,
know-it-all prick all night.

1582
01:29:47,182 --> 01:29:48,884
That's before he had
a drop of alcohol.

1583
01:29:48,984 --> 01:29:50,352
So what gives?

1584
01:29:50,453 --> 01:29:51,787
I don't know.

1585
01:29:51,887 --> 01:29:54,189
You ever hear the cliche,
old habits die hard?

1586
01:29:54,289 --> 01:29:55,558
Yeah.

1587
01:29:55,658 --> 01:29:57,793
Well, cliches only going to
be cliches when they're true.

1588
01:30:00,696 --> 01:30:02,164
Can you elaborate?

1589
01:30:02,264 --> 01:30:04,132
Do you want the long
story or the Cliffs Notes?

1590
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:06,034
Cliffs Notes.

1591
01:30:06,134 --> 01:30:08,637
See, me and JT went to
grade school together.

1592
01:30:08,737 --> 01:30:10,506
And back then, I was little.

1593
01:30:10,606 --> 01:30:12,741
I mean, like 4' 11", and
I weighed about as much

1594
01:30:12,841 --> 01:30:13,576
As a small dog.

1595
01:30:13,676 --> 01:30:14,677
Right?

1596
01:30:14,777 --> 01:30:15,811
Strong winds could blow me...
Hey, Christ.

1597
01:30:15,911 --> 01:30:17,312
I get it.
Come on.

1598
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:22,585
Anyways, one day,
this inbred ass fucker

1599
01:30:22,685 --> 01:30:23,919
Is screwing with me
for what must have

1600
01:30:24,019 --> 01:30:25,688
Been the 50th time that week.

1601
01:30:25,788 --> 01:30:27,556
He's asking me for
my shoes, asking me

1602
01:30:27,656 --> 01:30:30,526
For my money, yada, yada, yada.

1603
01:30:30,626 --> 01:30:32,995
JT busts out like
fuckin' Batman, right?

1604
01:30:33,095 --> 01:30:35,263
I mean, he does a real
ass whipping on this guy.

1605
01:30:35,363 --> 01:30:38,501
He used his face as a mop.

1606
01:30:38,601 --> 01:30:41,537
And after that, we
just started talking.

1607
01:30:41,637 --> 01:30:44,339
He told me about how he likes
watching movies in letter box

1608
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:47,109
And how much he
hates pan and scan.

1609
01:30:47,209 --> 01:30:49,177
I told him I felt the same
way, and that was that.

1610
01:30:49,277 --> 01:30:49,978
No, no.

1611
01:30:50,078 --> 01:30:51,379
Not exactly.

1612
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:53,882
And I want to know where Captain
Sarcasm got his big mouth from.

1613
01:30:53,982 --> 01:30:54,917
Can you answer me that one?

1614
01:30:55,017 --> 01:30:56,451
It's the way he's always been.

1615
01:30:56,552 --> 01:30:58,320
What can I tell you, man?

1616
01:30:58,420 --> 01:31:01,089
Puberty hit JT really early.

1617
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:03,692
And for a long damn time, he
was bigger than everybody else

1618
01:31:03,792 --> 01:31:04,660
In our grade.

1619
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:06,061
So he could say
whatever he wanted to,

1620
01:31:06,161 --> 01:31:07,830
And he didn't have to
worry, because nobody

1621
01:31:07,930 --> 01:31:09,231
Would dare touch him.

1622
01:31:09,331 --> 01:31:11,399
And then high school came along.

1623
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:14,937
All of a sudden, JT started
looking up to a lot of people.

1624
01:31:15,037 --> 01:31:17,305
Needless to say, that
didn't go over too well.

1625
01:31:17,405 --> 01:31:19,642
I must've gotten his ass
out of a hundred flights.

1626
01:31:19,742 --> 01:31:21,577
What are you, his
Secret Service agent?

1627
01:31:21,677 --> 01:31:23,546
Doesn't that get to you?

1628
01:31:23,646 --> 01:31:25,648
Look, even if it
did... which I'm

1629
01:31:25,748 --> 01:31:28,416
Not saying it does...
Friends like JT

1630
01:31:28,517 --> 01:31:30,252
Don't come easy or often.

1631
01:31:30,352 --> 01:31:32,220
And the way I see it,
once they're your friends,

1632
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,722
They're your friends
no matter what,

1633
01:31:33,822 --> 01:31:37,760
And you do whatever you have
to do to keep it that way.

1634
01:31:37,860 --> 01:31:38,694
Oh, thanks.

1635
01:31:42,665 --> 01:31:43,398
Oh, hey.

1636
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:45,834
Oh, I'm so sorry, honey bear.

1637
01:31:45,934 --> 01:31:47,670
I'm just not all
that with it today.

1638
01:31:47,770 --> 01:31:50,505
See, once a year, I try to
donate as much blood as I can.

1639
01:31:50,606 --> 01:31:52,374
Today just happened
to be the special day.

1640
01:31:52,474 --> 01:31:55,077
Probably shouldn't be working,
but Kyle... that's our boss...

1641
01:31:55,177 --> 01:31:56,444
He's a real asshole.

1642
01:31:56,545 --> 01:31:58,547
Wouldn't give me the day off.

1643
01:31:58,647 --> 01:32:00,048
Well, what do you do?

1644
01:32:07,055 --> 01:32:08,691
Didn't Adia say something
about her boyfriend

1645
01:32:08,791 --> 01:32:09,491
Working at a hospital?

1646
01:32:15,864 --> 01:32:17,132
[Knocking]

1647
01:32:17,232 --> 01:32:17,933
JT, come on.

1648
01:32:18,033 --> 01:32:20,135
We gotta go.

1649
01:32:20,235 --> 01:32:21,069
I'm not going anywhere.

1650
01:32:21,169 --> 01:32:23,105
Why the hell not?

1651
01:32:23,205 --> 01:32:25,608
JT: Because there's no
toilet paper in here.

1652
01:32:25,708 --> 01:32:26,441
Aw, shit.

1653
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:27,242
None?

1654
01:32:27,342 --> 01:32:28,243
Not a shred.

1655
01:32:28,343 --> 01:32:29,511
- Well, use something else.
- Oh, yeah.

1656
01:32:29,612 --> 01:32:30,713
Good idea.

1657
01:32:30,813 --> 01:32:32,848
Why don't you toss your
shirt on over here, Alex?

1658
01:32:32,948 --> 01:32:33,949
Ah, shit.

1659
01:32:34,049 --> 01:32:35,984
I'm going to go get
him some toilet paper.

1660
01:32:36,084 --> 01:32:37,886
What's... you know,
what's the rush, anyway?

1661
01:32:37,986 --> 01:32:40,756
We think we figured out why
Slain's taking vamp blood.

1662
01:32:40,856 --> 01:32:42,090
All right, I'm listening.

1663
01:32:42,190 --> 01:32:43,258
Well, all right.

1664
01:32:43,358 --> 01:32:44,793
Adia mentioned that Slain
works in a hospital,

1665
01:32:44,893 --> 01:32:46,394
And hospitals have
blood banks, right?

1666
01:32:46,494 --> 01:32:47,529
Yeah, right.

1667
01:32:47,630 --> 01:32:49,264
For transfusions and car
accidents, yeah, right.

1668
01:32:49,364 --> 01:32:50,332
Right, right.

1669
01:32:50,432 --> 01:32:51,700
Well if Slain had access
to the blood bank,

1670
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:53,535
He could use the vamp blood
he has in the cooler to taint

1671
01:32:53,636 --> 01:32:55,203
All of the hospital's
entire blood supply,

1672
01:32:55,303 --> 01:32:59,407
Thus making hundreds
of patients vamps.

1673
01:32:59,507 --> 01:33:02,611
But why type the bag so
carefully if he's just going

1674
01:33:02,711 --> 01:33:03,812
To taint the whole supply?

1675
01:33:03,912 --> 01:33:05,848
Well, because if you
mix the wrong vamp blood

1676
01:33:05,948 --> 01:33:08,383
With the wrong human
blood, it turns black,

1677
01:33:08,483 --> 01:33:10,585
And no doctors are
going to use that.

1678
01:33:10,686 --> 01:33:14,222
It's like putting a square
peg into a round hole.

1679
01:33:14,322 --> 01:33:16,424
So only for matching
the blood tit for fucking

1680
01:33:16,524 --> 01:33:19,494
Tat will the blood be
successfully tainted.

1681
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:21,029
That's right.
Without being noticed?

1682
01:33:21,129 --> 01:33:22,097
Yeah.

1683
01:33:22,197 --> 01:33:23,932
JT: Well, how much
vampire blood does it

1684
01:33:24,032 --> 01:33:24,933
Take to taint human blood?

1685
01:33:25,033 --> 01:33:26,034
A lot or...
No, no, no.

1686
01:33:26,134 --> 01:33:27,002
One drop.

1687
01:33:27,102 --> 01:33:27,970
JT: A drop?

1688
01:33:28,070 --> 01:33:29,171
One drop.

1689
01:33:29,271 --> 01:33:32,174
One drop of vampire blood
gets into human blood,

1690
01:33:32,274 --> 01:33:33,308
Whoever gets that
blood isn't going

1691
01:33:33,408 --> 01:33:35,143
To be very human for very long.

1692
01:33:35,243 --> 01:33:36,544
Fuck.

1693
01:33:36,645 --> 01:33:38,446
But why would he want to turn
a bunch of people into vamps?

1694
01:33:38,546 --> 01:33:39,715
I mean, why would
anybody want to turn

1695
01:33:39,815 --> 01:33:42,017
Another person into a vampire?

1696
01:33:42,117 --> 01:33:45,253
I think he's in pain,
and he wants other people

1697
01:33:45,353 --> 01:33:47,589
To experience that pain.

1698
01:33:47,690 --> 01:33:49,057
Uh, I'm not following you.

1699
01:33:49,157 --> 01:33:50,125
What do you mean, here?

1700
01:33:50,225 --> 01:33:51,426
Well, it's like this
story I once heard.

1701
01:33:51,526 --> 01:33:52,394
OK?

1702
01:33:52,494 --> 01:33:53,729
There's this guy
who goes into a bar.

1703
01:33:53,829 --> 01:33:56,298
He gets a little too
drunk, he meets this girl,

1704
01:33:56,398 --> 01:33:57,465
He takes her home to have sex.

1705
01:33:57,565 --> 01:33:58,600
JT: OK.

1706
01:33:58,701 --> 01:34:00,368
Guy wakes up the next
morning, and she's gone.

1707
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:01,369
He thinks nothing of it.

1708
01:34:01,469 --> 01:34:03,571
He goes to his
bathroom, and there

1709
01:34:03,672 --> 01:34:04,907
On the mirror,
written in lipstick

1710
01:34:05,007 --> 01:34:08,643
Is the phrase,
"Welcome to AIDS."

1711
01:34:08,744 --> 01:34:10,913
Jesus fucking Christ.

1712
01:34:11,013 --> 01:34:12,214
ALEX: I should have
saw this coming.

1713
01:34:12,314 --> 01:34:13,982
You know, all of us
vamps feel the same way

1714
01:34:14,082 --> 01:34:16,051
At one point or another.

1715
01:34:16,151 --> 01:34:17,519
Did you ever go through it?

1716
01:34:21,589 --> 01:34:23,926
Yeah.

1717
01:34:24,026 --> 01:34:27,796
When you've been in three wars,
and you lose entire platoons

1718
01:34:27,896 --> 01:34:31,199
Of guys younger than you,
that's when you start

1719
01:34:31,299 --> 01:34:34,202
Asking yourself things,
like why you survived,

1720
01:34:34,302 --> 01:34:35,503
And why couldn't they?

1721
01:34:35,603 --> 01:34:37,339
And is there anything you
could have done to help them?

1722
01:34:37,439 --> 01:34:40,776
When you bury your
little sister before you,

1723
01:34:40,876 --> 01:34:44,112
Let's just say that's not
the natural order of things.

1724
01:34:44,212 --> 01:34:46,081
That's when you start
focusing on the pain,

1725
01:34:46,181 --> 01:34:48,416
And you start blaming people.

1726
01:34:48,516 --> 01:34:49,718
JT: Blaming... wait a second.

1727
01:34:49,818 --> 01:34:51,019
Blaming... blaming
people for what?

1728
01:34:51,119 --> 01:34:53,421
For not being as
unlucky as you.

1729
01:34:57,893 --> 01:35:04,199
Well, look on the
bright side, Count.

1730
01:35:04,299 --> 01:35:08,403
At least you had
friends to bury.

1731
01:35:08,503 --> 01:35:10,038
They're all out
of toilet paper.

1732
01:35:10,138 --> 01:35:11,039
Oh, it'll do.

1733
01:35:11,139 --> 01:35:12,074
Go throw it over.

1734
01:35:15,043 --> 01:35:15,844
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ!

1735
01:35:15,944 --> 01:35:16,611
Are you serious?

1736
01:35:16,711 --> 01:35:17,679
Paper towels?

1737
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:19,848
You want me to wipe
my ass with this?

1738
01:35:19,948 --> 01:35:21,950
Why didn't you just go the whole
nine and bring back steel wool

1739
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:22,851
Brillo pads.

1740
01:35:30,893 --> 01:35:34,162
[Laughs] So how
do you feel, huh?

1741
01:35:34,262 --> 01:35:37,665
Like I've been anally
raped by a sandpaper dildo.

1742
01:35:37,766 --> 01:35:40,435
There are four
hospitals in this area.

1743
01:35:40,535 --> 01:35:42,704
We can't possibly check
them all in one night.

1744
01:35:42,805 --> 01:35:44,039
You sweeties left
this at your table.

1745
01:35:44,139 --> 01:35:46,775
Oh, thanks.

1746
01:35:46,875 --> 01:35:47,742
Four hospitals.

1747
01:35:50,445 --> 01:35:51,546
Christ.

1748
01:35:51,646 --> 01:35:59,054
What the... Guys, we don't
have to check all four.

1749
01:35:59,154 --> 01:36:00,022
Kern Hospital.

1750
01:36:00,122 --> 01:36:00,823
Daquindre.

1751
01:36:26,815 --> 01:36:27,749
Hey Slain.

1752
01:36:27,850 --> 01:36:28,750
How are you doing?

1753
01:37:59,942 --> 01:38:00,642
Hematology?

1754
01:38:14,222 --> 01:38:15,090
Hey, hey, hey!

1755
01:38:15,190 --> 01:38:16,925
You got authorization
to be here?

1756
01:38:17,025 --> 01:38:17,792
Where's Slain?

1757
01:38:17,892 --> 01:38:18,760
He's in the lab.

1758
01:38:25,267 --> 01:38:27,602
Oh, that was very cool of us.

1759
01:38:27,702 --> 01:38:29,972
Hey, are you... are you sure
you should just rush in there?

1760
01:38:33,575 --> 01:38:36,478
[Grunting]

1761
01:39:11,079 --> 01:39:14,282
You mess with my friend,
you mess with... [grunts]

1762
01:39:24,759 --> 01:39:27,129
[Screaming]

1763
01:39:56,458 --> 01:39:59,327
[Gurgling]

1764
01:40:06,034 --> 01:40:07,435
[Grunts]

1765
01:40:18,980 --> 01:40:19,881
Thank you.

1766
01:40:53,548 --> 01:40:54,249
Alex.

1767
01:41:06,861 --> 01:41:08,263
Sure you got it all?

1768
01:41:08,363 --> 01:41:09,231
Yeah, I got it all.

1769
01:41:09,331 --> 01:41:12,134
Only the old bags were tainted.

1770
01:41:12,234 --> 01:41:13,067
What time is it?

1771
01:41:16,003 --> 01:41:17,805
A little after 1:30.

1772
01:41:17,905 --> 01:41:19,941
Well, I was thinking, you know,
it's a little late and all,

1773
01:41:20,041 --> 01:41:21,543
But if we get to
the theater in time,

1774
01:41:21,643 --> 01:41:22,977
We could still see
uh, Daryl Hannah crush

1775
01:41:23,077 --> 01:41:24,246
Harrison Ford in the crotch.

1776
01:41:27,315 --> 01:41:28,216
All right.

1777
01:41:28,316 --> 01:41:29,016
All right.

1778
01:41:40,795 --> 01:41:43,198
[Car engine turning over]

1779
01:41:55,777 --> 01:41:59,914
