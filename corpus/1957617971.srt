1
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:12,979
(wind whooshing)

2
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:23,256
(dramatic foreboding music)

3
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:41,841
(man knocking)

4
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:45,545
(dramatic foreboding music)

5
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:55,989
(guns firing)

6
00:00:58,625 --> 00:00:59,459
- Ah!

7
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,906
(guns firing)

8
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:15,708
(dramatic music)

9
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:28,655
(guns firing)

10
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:51,277
- [Billy] Killing is not something I enjoyed doing.

11
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,346
It's just what I had to do to survive.

12
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,017
(jazz music)

13
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,986
There's two sides of me.

14
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:02,755
One side loves money and power.

15
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,859
The other side wants a simple and honest life.

16
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,760
It's hard to live both sides.

17
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:12,866
I love this city.

18
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:13,967
But I'm just getting tired

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,436
of this dog-eat-dog world we're living.

20
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,611
Dealing drugs happens to be my profession.

21
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,412
A profession I would have chosen different,

22
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:30,049
if I would've known back then how life would be today.

23
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:01,314
(water boiling)

24
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:21,034
Today is gonna be a beautiful day.

25
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,611
Let's make some money.

26
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:34,080
(jazz music)

27
00:03:58,237 --> 00:03:59,105
(car honking)

28
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:00,073
- What's up, man?

29
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:02,041
- [Billy] Hurry up! - - Oh, Fuck up man.

30
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,977
How you doing brother? Let's go over here.

31
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:04,844
All right man.

32
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:11,084
- [Billy] This is my partner, Tyrone,

33
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,453
a womanizer and a drug dealer.

34
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:15,388
He and I grew up together.

35
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,557
He saved my life when we were kids.

36
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,692
And we've been crying partners ever since.

37
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,964
(footsteps squelching)

38
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:29,669
- [Mr. Brigante] Yeah, I'm gonna get home.

39
00:04:29,702 --> 00:04:31,771
I promise you that.

40
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,240
Hey, nice to see you again, Billy.

41
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:35,275
See, business is good?

42
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,809
- Business couldn't be better.

43
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:40,546
- [Mr. Brigante] Good doing business with you, Billy.

44
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,581
You're a man of your word.

45
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,249
I like it. - - Same here. Same here.

46
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:44,584
Hey Tyrone, let's go.

47
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:51,991
- You got good tastes in a women there, Mr. Brigante.

48
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,227
- [Mr. Brigante] Thank you, Tyrone.

49
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,161
Yes, take it easy man.

50
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:56,062
- [Billy And Tyrone] Alright.

51
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:03,536
- [Billy] Too much love can really

52
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:06,172
make a man lose touch of reality.

53
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:10,209
My client, Mr. Rodrigo had a bad case of it.

54
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,146
He had all the money in the world

55
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:16,115
but money could not buy him happiness.

56
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,885
(dramatic music)

57
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,365
- She's so beautiful.

58
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:44,010
- [Billy] What do you want done to?

59
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,389
- His legs.

60
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:59,158
(dramatic music)

61
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,579
(car engine revving)

62
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:36,629
(suspenseful music)

63
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:10,429
- [Billy] $5,000 was an average man's salary

64
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:11,731
and I made it in the day.

65
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:13,866
But is it all worth it?

66
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,402
I don't know.

67
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,309
(car revving)

68
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,346
(distant chattering)

69
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,448
- What do you want to drink?

70
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:29,315
- Scotch.

71
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,986
- Billy what's up, man.

72
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,788
Stay here, I'll be right back.

73
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,356
Man, where you've been? Like, you ain't calling me

74
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,025
my brother back man. I've been paid you, I've paid you,

75
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:41,060
y'all like you don't like me or something.

76
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:41,894
- I've been here,

77
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:42,728
well. - - Oh man.

78
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:43,830
Look, Rufus is looking for you.

79
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,331
- I don't know, man.

80
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:46,599
I don't do any of that small time shit, man.

81
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,035
- Jeez. - - The money's no good.

82
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,069
- Come on man, small time, man.

83
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:53,472
This is a big time, man. This is Alfredo brothers.

84
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:54,674
- Hey is that Ricky?

85
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:55,842
- [Tyrone] Oh yes, that's her.

86
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,945
You know, I don't know how you manage to juggle

87
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,079
all these women.

88
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:01,514
- Who? Them? come on, man.

89
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:03,816
It's called lying and it's also called money.

90
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:04,650
I need some more money, man.

91
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:05,551
I'm broke, man.

92
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,053
You gotta kick me down with something.

93
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,020
I don't know.

94
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,188
- How much do you owe me already.

95
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,456
- Does that matter? I'm your friend, man.

96
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:12,558
Come on now, give me some more money, hurry up man.

97
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,293
All there's people around and I'm all broken up

98
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,761
and my brother look along, you know,

99
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,196
toe up. Come on now.

100
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,166
Come on now, you don't need to count that.

101
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,101
Come on, come on man.

102
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:22,935
- That's all I got.

103
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,303
- Hey, well you can get some more.

104
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,906
You know I have a hard time keeping cash in my pocket.

105
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:27,740
I gotta go.

106
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,342
- Back there. - - I will, hey.

107
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,978
Don't forget the car roof for now, man alright.

108
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,980
Hey, who loves you baby?

109
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:34,814
- You do.

110
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:35,681
- That's right! Ha ha.

111
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:41,621
- So you've got my money?

112
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:44,156
- Oh, hell money baby, you've got me.

113
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,892
How are you gonna need money, huh?

114
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,728
Hey, can we get a drink bartender come on.

115
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,330
(distant chattering)

116
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,899
Thank you.

117
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,534
Can you open my beer? What's up!

118
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:07,013
(dramatic music)

119
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,528
- [Billy] For the first time in my life

120
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,064
I started to feel alone.

121
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,300
Something is missing in my life.

122
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:03,336
I wanted someone.

123
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:04,203
I could talk to.

124
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,173
Someone I felt connected with.

125
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,076
Having these feelings with drug addict women,

126
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,711
just don't cut it anymore.

127
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:29,662
- So what do you do Billy?

128
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:31,197
- Me? What do I do?

129
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,200
More alike, deal with a lot of street gang

130
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,267
here in Los Angeles.

131
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,738
- Was that a part of the poverty program or something?

132
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:39,739
- Yeah, yeah.

133
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,842
Poverty program, street gang.

134
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,477
All the same thing.

135
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,147
- And what exactly do you do in this?

136
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,317
- I help, kids deal with their social problem.

137
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:53,652
Yeah.

138
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:58,157
(dramatic music)

139
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:05,364
(car revving)

140
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,675
- Hey Billy, check this out.

141
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:16,709
When done getting gas here.

142
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:19,311
Let me treat you to a Tommy's Burger.

143
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,846
- Nah, I don't touch that stuff,

144
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,814
too greasy, you know.

145
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,315
- Man, you don't know what you're missing.

146
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,419
- You see that stuff when I first arrived here in LA.

147
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:29,655
- Listen Billy, I got this job

148
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,691
and I need you to back me up.

149
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:36,128
I'll go half with you tomorrow night.

150
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,197
- How much?

151
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,065
- 10 G's.

152
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,368
- I'm in. When?

153
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:43,269
- Tomorrow night.

154
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,774
Nice ride.

155
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:52,311
Damn.

156
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,483
(upbeat music)

157
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:26,846
(door thuds)

158
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:27,947
- Hey, where are your gun?

159
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,948
- Nah, I don't need gun inside.

160
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,616
Nobody handling pistols are better than me.

161
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,885
- It's okay Tyrone, you need to stand point.

162
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,386
- Man, why do you always pull this shit?

163
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,822
Every time something's about to go down.

164
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,624
That's what I'm worried about and if you get shot,

165
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:39,792
Billy owed me 20 bucks.

166
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:45,197
- So, what's up?

167
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,068
- How it's going?

168
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,644
Couldn't be better with this stuff, man.

169
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,112
- Turn around.

170
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,647
- Who's this vato?

171
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,016
- This is Billy, a good friend of mine.

172
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:05,751
- He's clean.

173
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,922
- So you got the stuff?

174
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,957
- Yeah, I got the stuff.

175
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,400
- Mind if I have a cigarette?

176
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,440
- You got the money?

177
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,580
- Yeah, I got the money.

178
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,656
(suspenseful music)

179
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:48,027
(indistinct)

180
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:04,410
(guns firing)

181
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,755
- You wanna mess with me?

182
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,003
(guns firing)

183
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:39,044
- [Policewoman] West 28, (indistinct)

184
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,721
- Let's go.

185
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,089
- What happened to let him live?

186
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:50,990
- He didn't make it.

187
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,925
- You owe me 20 bucks man. I told you.

188
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,234
(car revving)

189
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:22,454
- [Billy] Judy, my little sister

190
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:23,656
was the only family

191
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:24,857
I felt connected to. - - Hey, Billy!

192
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:25,824
Wait wait yeah?

193
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:27,760
Stop it Billy!

194
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:28,594
- Was that your

195
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:29,461
boyfriend? - - No!

196
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,599
Wait, yeah? When?

197
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,068
- What are you doing here?

198
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,136
- Just came to visit.

199
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:39,905
See how you guys were doing.

200
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,515
Why can't you forget about the past?

201
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:52,017
- How could I forget about the past?

202
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:53,652
I toss and turn all night.

203
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:54,987
Trying to forget about it.

204
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,591
Mom was killed by somebody like you!

205
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,294
Now tell me how could I forget a thing about that?

206
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:06,832
- I love mom and dad as much as you did, Jeff.

207
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,200
- You are selfish!

208
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:14,473
- If I could change things, I would Jeff.

209
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:17,042
But I can't! You understand, I can't!

210
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:18,644
- Can't you two just get along?

211
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:24,350
- You had a choice Billy.

212
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,522
You just don't want to change.

213
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,428
You just didn't want to change.

214
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,507
- Billy.

215
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,147
I want you to have this.

216
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:59,818
(dramatic music)

217
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,627
(car revving)

218
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,298
(guns firing)

219
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:32,918
- Mom!

220
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,455
Mom!

221
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:37,322
Mom!

222
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,406
I love my mom.

223
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:58,477
You only tend to realize how much you really love someone

224
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,511
until they're gone.

225
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,617
(car revving)

226
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,121
- Want a beer man?

227
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:10,756
- Yeah, thanks.

228
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,492
- Were a job Billy about that?

229
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,761
Bad deal the one down with Rufo's death, man.

230
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:19,765
(indistinct) Look for the dude who stole their money.

231
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:22,634
- Yeah, so let them look.

232
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,870
- You know, you just watch your back, man.

233
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,538
You're getting hotter these days.

234
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,842
Get another problem.

235
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,012
One of our clients is refusing to pay.

236
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,147
- And why does he don't want to pay?

237
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,015
- Well, ever since he made friends

238
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,717
with the Alfredo brothers,

239
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,085
he thinks he's big shit now.

240
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:43,322
- Well, we just have to fix that, won't we?

241
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:45,057
- Well I say I miss this, exactly.

242
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:53,432
- Get his wallet.

243
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,633
- Don't kill me, man.

244
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,134
Please don't kill me.

245
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:56,935
- How much does he have?

246
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:57,970
- A lot of grand?

247
00:18:58,003 --> 00:18:59,204
- Take it.

248
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:00,706
- Just don't kill me man.

249
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:03,141
- [Billy] Shut up! - - Just don't.

250
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,444
- The next time you're late on your payment.

251
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,346
You die, just like that, you understand?

252
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:08,480
- Yes. - - You die,

253
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:09,615
just like that.

254
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,216
- Hey come on man, let me mess him up, come on.

255
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,417
- Mess him up.

256
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:23,729
- Do you know?

257
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:26,532
When did this happen?

258
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:30,536
Uh huh?

259
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:39,111
Why wasn't I told about it?

260
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,848
Well, it's bullshit!

261
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:45,784
You know what I mean!

262
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:48,487
Junior! Junior!

263
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,723
Close that refrigerator and get your fat ass in here!

264
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,425
- Yeah, yeah. What's your problem, man?

265
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,827
What do you got crawling up by this time?

266
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,729
- Hey, who is this Billy guy?

267
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,164
- Billy?

268
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:03,669
Oh, he's some dealer from the East side, some Filipino.

269
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,637
What's it all about?

270
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:08,106
- Well, he's a dealer on our side?

271
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,342
sticking my money, our business.

272
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,209
I want you to brought him

273
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,778
and I want you to brought him now!

274
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:13,879
- Calm down, you gotta get a heart attack.

275
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,147
- Hey don't you tell me calm down.

276
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,282
How the hell do you think I get all this shit around here?

277
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:18,350
Get, get in there!

278
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:21,119
Junior.

279
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,723
- Alright, I gonna call him right now.

280
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,760
- What have I become?

281
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:34,533
(guns cracking)

282
00:20:56,254 --> 00:20:58,523
Anne was an old girlfriend of mine.

283
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:01,393
She was the only girl I ever fell in love with.

284
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,662
- You told me yesterday, you were gonna stop.

285
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:05,497
I saw you down there.

286
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,299
You beat the crap out of that guy. Why?

287
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:08,834
Because he didn't pay you up?

288
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:12,304
- Hey look, if I let one asshole off the hook,

289
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:14,673
then every single asshole let their grandmother

290
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:15,774
would be blowing me off.

291
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:19,144
- Don't you see, that's not what this is all about

292
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,746
you believe Billy.

293
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,214
That means you can die.

294
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,149
You, even though you can't get

295
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:27,386
that simple factor in your skull, I can't.

296
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:30,088
- Nothing's gonna happen to me.

297
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,058
- I believe you Billy.

298
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,094
Only because, I wanted to believe in you.

299
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:38,764
- I'm getting out.

300
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,065
- You said that yesterday.

301
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,869
Don't say things you don't mean, okay?

302
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,471
- Listen, I love you.

303
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,712
- You don't love me.

304
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,649
You love your work.

305
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:02,854
(dramatic music)

306
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:15,801
- [Billy] I yearn to have a family

307
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,869
and just lead a simple life.

308
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:19,471
Have a wife and a son.

309
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:22,307
I enjoyed watching kids,

310
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,277
they give off so much happiness.

311
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,545
Something I lacked in mind.

312
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:28,046
- So it was the new girl.

313
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:28,914
Oh man. That's needed man.

314
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:30,215
I met her at the gases.

315
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:31,450
She spent some gas up.

316
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:35,220
McEntire, you know, bring her along for the ride.

317
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:37,189
- You're always with a new girl Tyrone.

318
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,560
- You know how it is man, I need to keep up my image.

319
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:43,061
(indistinct) what's up?

320
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:43,995
- It's all there.

321
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:49,501
(indistinct)

322
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:54,106
you gonna do it real fast.

323
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:59,444
You got the sad puppy dog look on your face Billy.

324
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:00,846
- I look like that?

325
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,047
- Yeah man.

326
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,881
- [Billy] You're kidding, right?

327
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:03,782
- No, I'm serious.

328
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:07,419
What you need to do is go out and get laid, man.

329
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:08,720
That what you need to do.

330
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,823
Man look out! Look out!

331
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:14,359
(guns firing)

332
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:19,731
(car revving)

333
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,099
- [Tyrone] Damn.

334
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,402
Come on man, we need to get out, come on!

335
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:27,506
- You bastard! You've killed my baby!

336
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,765
- Don't you ever steal from me.

337
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:02,574
(dramatic foreboding music)

338
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:09,548
- [Billy] Look at my world.

339
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:12,217
These guys find their happiness hanging out drinking.

340
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:15,120
10 years.

341
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:15,987
And what am I?

342
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:19,124
I have nothing solid to show for it.

343
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:20,225
What are you doing?

344
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:21,593
- [Woman] What do you think I'm doing?

345
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:22,561
- You're too young for this.

346
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:23,728
- I'm 14 years old.

347
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:26,164
- That's right you're 14 years old.

348
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:29,601
- Damn Billy, we just want to try to have some fun.

349
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:36,041
(distant chattering)

350
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:02,567
- [Billy] Having friends and someone to love

351
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:03,602
is what I wanted.

352
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:05,737
The sad thing about it is,

353
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,707
in my circle of friends.

354
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,708
It's impossible.

355
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:12,811
- What!

356
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:36,334
- Amber, this is not a toy.

357
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:40,372
(indistinct)

358
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:42,841
- What's the matter with you?

359
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:01,893
- Hey man, where do you think your going man?

360
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:03,261
- Hey we're talking to you.

361
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:05,864
- Sup man, you think you're bad? Give me your money.

362
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,599
- [Man] Get back over here.

363
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:10,268
(indistinct)

364
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,137
- Hey get his money! Get his money!

365
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,072
- What's up man, you think you're bad? Sup!

366
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:15,874
- What's up man, you're trying to get crazy?

367
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:07,425
- He owes Kuziak's money?

368
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,461
- Yeah, Kuziak Fernando Makilah

369
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:11,496
and he hasn't paid him back since.

370
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:14,599
You know he's selling Kuziak's dope, don't you right?

371
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:17,602
Right?

372
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,206
Shit.

373
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:23,641
(indistinct)

374
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:29,147
- My favorite place, you know I'm saying?

375
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,215
- What an asshole.

376
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:34,019
- Tyrone, who is this?

377
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:34,953
(indistinct)

378
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:35,754
- Who is this? - - I don't know!

379
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:36,855
- Is there something

380
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:38,023
we need to discuss? - - No, you need to sit down.

381
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,958
- Cause I remember seeing this woman before.

382
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,627
- Billy, girls. Girls, Billy.

383
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,962
- Tyrone, I gotta talk to you.

384
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:44,963
- Right now?

385
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,131
- [Billy] Yes.

386
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,432
Now.

387
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:48,967
- Billy, come on.

388
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,568
Just try not to embarrass me, man.

389
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:52,170
- Excuse me ladies, but I'd like to take

390
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:55,106
a moment of Mr. Tyrone's time, if you don't mind?

391
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,775
- Okay, you can take a little moment of my time

392
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,543
but let us not too much time now, right?

393
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:01,546
Hey bartender, get the girls drink, put it on my tab.

394
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:03,048
- You never have a tab man.

395
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,616
- Well hell, put it on his tab?

396
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:10,021
- Tyrone? What are you thinking?

397
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:12,257
- What do you mean what am I thinking?

398
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:13,625
- Who do you owe money to?

399
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:14,759
- I owe money to nobody, man.

400
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:15,593
- Don't lie to me. - - What are you talking about?

401
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:16,861
Who do you owe money to?

402
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,763
- Come on, I'm not lying to you at all.

403
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:22,267
You believe Ricky? Come on, you can't listen to her, man.

404
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,135
(indistinct)

405
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:25,670
Come on, you're tripping out, man.

406
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:26,838
- Kuziak.

407
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,573
- Kuziak? What about them? I don't know about nothing.

408
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:30,742
- You owe him money.

409
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:32,777
- No, I don't. What's up with you man?

410
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:33,945
Why are you tripping like this?

411
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:36,815
- Tyrone? You know I know you.

412
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:39,751
So why don't you tell me what I need to know.

413
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:42,053
- All right man, all right.

414
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:43,321
Look, look, okay.

415
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:45,356
I'm trying to make a little side cash, all right.

416
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,525
I've got a little something from Kuziak, you know?

417
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,295
But, no big deal. I ain't scared on Kuziak.

418
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:51,596
- Kuziak is one dirty cop

419
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:53,331
you don't wanna mess with, you understand?

420
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:54,566
You'll take it back.

421
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,702
- All right, all right, fine.

422
00:28:57,735 --> 00:29:00,071
- Listen, I can always watch your back.

423
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:02,207
You gotta think Tyrone. You gotta think.

424
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,376
- I'm Sorry. I'll take it back and no big deal.

425
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:08,847
- You don't need side cash.

426
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,681
You get greedy.

427
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:10,982
It's going to come back to you.

428
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,083
Big time.

429
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,084
Control Tyrone.

430
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:14,452
Just control.

431
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:15,487
Control. - - Control.

432
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,621
- Discipline. - - Discipline.

433
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:18,323
- And focus. - - And focus.

434
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:19,991
- We can show them discipline.

435
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:22,427
Ladies! Ladies! Come on in here.

436
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,394
- What baby?

437
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,829
(indistinct)

438
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:27,765
- Now this is a control and this is discipline.

439
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:37,408
Hey, we've got to loosen up baby, loosen up now.

440
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:40,912
(car revving)

441
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,262
(guns firing)

442
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,491
- Okay Tyrone, why did you bring me down?

443
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:28,259
- What do you mean why bring you down, man?

444
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:30,261
Yeah, Alfredo brothers got a hit on us.

445
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:33,131
- I figured this will happen.

446
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,799
What do you think we should do?

447
00:30:34,832 --> 00:30:37,936
- What I think we should do?

448
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:39,537
Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!

449
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:42,073
(guns firing)

450
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,499
- Who the hell does this guy think he is?

451
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:14,372
- You want me to take them out?

452
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:16,574
- This guy is good.

453
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:17,709
- Shut the fuck up.

454
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,012
- All I'm saying is.

455
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,081
- I said shut the fuck up.

456
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:27,051
- You got lucky, it won't happen again.

457
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:30,855
- I want to meet this Billy vato.

458
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,226
Tony,

459
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,429
go get the car ready.

460
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:00,551
- Okay, okay. So I used to be a drugs.

461
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,686
But that was a past.

462
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:03,021
I don't do that anymore.

463
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:05,189
I'm just helping out an old friend.

464
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:08,059
- Just stop it, will you?

465
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,794
- Anne you can't just walk out on me like

466
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:12,597
that without giving me a chance to explain.

467
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,032
You just don't understand

468
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,034
how it is to survive in this world.

469
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,469
- Billy, I come from the real world.

470
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:21,472
I know where you come from, I'm not stupid.

471
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:22,840
You lied to me Billy.

472
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:25,143
The poverty program?

473
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:28,546
There's no such thing, is there? Huh?

474
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,115
- Um,

475
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:34,319
Not exactly.

476
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:37,555
I mean, I just don't know how many poverty types

477
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:39,424
I have to deal with every single day.

478
00:32:40,925 --> 00:32:41,959
- You're just afraid.

479
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:47,632
Some day, some bad man like you is gonna come in

480
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:49,000
and break my heart.

481
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:51,469
- No, not me.

482
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:56,708
I will never break your heart.

483
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:21,632
(dramatic music)

484
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:19,357
(indistinct)

485
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,825
- [Billy] This is Dave Kuziak.

486
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:22,760
A dirty no-good-cop.

487
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:24,962
What he does is steal from drug dealers

488
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:27,098
and sells them to the Alfredo brothers,

489
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:29,066
which they re-sell to the streets.

490
00:34:31,135 --> 00:34:34,739
- Fine. Listen, will you do me a favor?

491
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:52,223
Let's go Tyrone.

492
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:57,261
- I like that, I like that.

493
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:02,166
- We brought the garbage here for you.

494
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:07,572
- All right.

495
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:08,906
- Merry Christmas.

496
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,441
Happy birthday. - - [Bad Cop] All right.

497
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:13,010
- Now go spend it all in one place.

498
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:15,246
That call so much attention yourselves guys.

499
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:18,516
Those cuffs are getting a little close.

500
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:21,185
Too close.

501
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:22,720
You're not smart as we are.

502
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:25,423
Okay, great.

503
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,325
All right bonehead. Get out here.

504
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:28,326
You're ugly enough

505
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:30,695
you're gonna have to go pay for it, get out.

506
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:31,562
- All right boss.

507
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,409
- So, where are your friends man, huh?

508
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,145
Where's your buddies?

509
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,119
Hmm? You're getting a lot huh?

510
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:55,987
What's going on here?

511
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:59,724
You're losing some weight! What's the matter Tyrone?

512
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:02,126
Can't hear you.

513
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,231
- What'd you get the knife for?

514
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:08,566
I got what you want. I got everything, man.

515
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:10,301
It's all in my house man.

516
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,335
I'm just gonna go there and get it,

517
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:14,405
but I can't get anything something happens to me.

518
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:15,439
Come on man.

519
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,276
What'd you doing man?

520
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:21,746
Good, see now we can talk, because you took the bullets out.

521
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:23,814
Now we can talk, listen, I can do whatever you want.

522
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,016
I can get you whatever you need.

523
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:28,019
Just, why one bullet? Why are you putting one bullet in?

524
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:30,888
Come on man, don't play around man. Its not funny.

525
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:32,657
Come on, man. Come on.

526
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:40,765
Come on, man! It is not funny, man.

527
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:43,234
Come on, I got everything you want, man.

528
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:44,735
- One more chances.

529
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,604
Let me get this straight.

530
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:48,573
Let me give you a kilo of Coke.

531
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:51,442
Somebody tells me that you're using

532
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:55,079
and entertaining all the ladies with it.

533
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:56,480
What's up with that Tyrone, huh?

534
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,350
Can you explain that to me?

535
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,451
What is that?

536
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,288
And then when I ask you for my money you tell me,

537
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:07,191
"Oh man, I don't know. I'll get you.

538
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,227
I'll get you. I don't know."

539
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,728
All these lame excuses.

540
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:16,133
You are nothing but a no good,

541
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:19,003
Coke-head a goddamn liar.

542
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,006
And what makes it worse?

543
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:24,875
Is that you're a thief.

544
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:27,211
- Oh man! Ugh!

545
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,514
- [Kuziak] Oh man. - - Why are you playing, man?

546
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:33,184
This is not funny, man.

547
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:34,252
Come on man.

548
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,489
- Can't you feel the rush? Oh man!

549
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:45,930
- I don't do drugs man.

550
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:47,832
I've been to rehab and I'm sober man.

551
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:50,134
Come on man. - - Goodnight Tyrone.

552
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:50,968
Goodnight. - - Come on, man.

553
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:52,069
No! Come on man!

554
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,571
Put it back man!

555
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,840
- [Kuzial] Whoo! - - Goddamn man!

556
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:58,042
When you kill me you better dead man.

557
00:37:58,075 --> 00:38:00,144
- Oh, wait a minute, you were telling me.

558
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,217
Oh my God. I tell you what,

559
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,321
I'm gonna let you go.

560
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:14,158
But I tell ya, I found you once

561
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:18,496
and I can, and I will find you again.

562
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:24,535
Bye bye.

563
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:31,108
- [Tyrone] I need to get out of this.

564
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,911
(dramatic music)

565
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,057
- Goodmorning Kate.

566
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,325
Can we get up for school?

567
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:50,294
Katie, get up.

568
00:38:50,327 --> 00:38:51,128
You know, if you want breakfast,

569
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,030
you have to help me. Now, get up.

570
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:55,433
Katie, I'm gonna be late for work now.

571
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:56,267
Get up.

572
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,134
- Give it back.

573
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:01,005
- You get it back when you get up, now get up.

574
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,458
(dramatic music)

575
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:24,628
- Billy,

576
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:31,235
I want you to have this.

577
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:36,874
- So what do you do Billy?

578
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:38,175
- You had a choice Billy.

579
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,281
You just didn't want to change.

580
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:04,101

587
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:38,269
- Sorry we're closed.

588
00:40:38,302 --> 00:40:40,037
- I'm kind of hungry.

589
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:42,640
- Billy?

590
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,182
So, you're going to stay if I get back, huh?

591
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:52,049
- Sure is.

592
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:53,951
It becomes my soul.

593
00:40:56,687 --> 00:41:00,191
Hey Anne still piss off me?

594
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:04,161
- I get over it.

595
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:11,268
- What you've been doing?

596
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,070
- I've been working a lot.

597
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:15,105
Trying to pay the bills.

598
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:19,043
- You know what's weird?

599
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:22,079
All this time, I was thinking getting,

600
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:27,117
stab, going in prison. (indistinct)

601
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,723
But now I'm getting this,

602
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:36,894
weird dream, you know, bad dreams of being tortured.

603
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:42,099
- So maybe it's time to get out in streets?

604
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:46,170
- I'm not on the streets anymore.

605
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:49,273
Don't matter. It makes no difference.

606
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:52,710
Somebody is always on my back.

607
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,654
- Billy,

608
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:05,890
I gotta go.

609
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:13,197
- Can I call you sometime?

610
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:16,100
- Let me call you.

611
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:31,382
You said you loved me Billy.

612
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:33,083
- I know, I'm sorry.

613
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:03,580
(distant chattering)

614
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:12,556
- What took you so long?

615
00:43:12,589 --> 00:43:14,558
- You know me man. Just fooling around.

616
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:23,600
- Now, don't smoke it. Sell it.

617
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:26,136
- All right, I will man, you know me.

618
00:43:28,806 --> 00:43:31,041
What's up to you man? Why y'all looking sad lately man?

619
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:33,444
What you need is some women.

620
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:34,712
- I look like that?

621
00:43:34,745 --> 00:43:36,046
You're kidding me, right?

622
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,016
- No, I'm not. I'm serious, man. Look at you.

623
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:40,417
Y'all look at all sad man.

624
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:43,787
I can get you laid if that's what you need.

625
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:45,222
- No, it's not that.

626
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:47,024
- I know this great little strip joint.

627
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:49,493
It got fine honeys there.

628
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:50,928
In fact I saw Anne in there.

629
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,032
- Anne works there?

630
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:56,233
- Yeah man.

631
00:43:57,701 --> 00:43:59,103
I don't know how you ever cut that honey loose.

632
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,372
She is like, she fine.

633
00:44:01,405 --> 00:44:02,740
- Nah, women are headaches.

634
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,676
- Not in that man, it's all how you look at it.

635
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:07,277
Maybe headache for you.

636
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,013
But it's a pleasure for me.

637
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:09,947
Cheer up, man.

638
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:22,926
(slow rock music)

639
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:29,960
(slow rock music)

640
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,069
- Hey. - - Hey.

641
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:40,304
- This is a surprise.

642
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:42,940
- Yeah, big surprise.

643
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:45,676
- What's the matter?

644
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:48,278
- Oh, nothing, nothing.

645
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:51,682
I just didn't know the situation.

646
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:57,087
- Yeah, well you haven't been around to know the situation.

647
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,825
My parents died in a car accident two years ago.

648
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:06,230
Made me an instant mother taking care of Kate.

649
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:09,032
- Why this Anne?

650
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:11,335
- Do you know how expensive it is to take care of a kid?

651
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:13,203
- There are other jobs Anne.

652
00:46:15,005 --> 00:46:16,974
- Sitting there judging me and I don't like it.

653
00:46:17,007 --> 00:46:17,841
- Wait a minute Anne.

654
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:19,042
- No, you wait a minute.

655
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:20,477
- Will you just give me a chance to talk?

656
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:22,079
- Did you kill anybody Billy?

657
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:30,087
- I got your point.

658
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:33,056
- Good.

659
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:38,996
- Where are you living?

660
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:44,635
- Well, I got a place in Hollywood.

661
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:14,064
(jazz music)

662
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:24,474
- You still have my picture?

663
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:26,743
- It never,

664
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:29,012
release my sight.

665
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:28,872
- Look Billy, everything is gonna be alright.

666
00:48:28,905 --> 00:48:30,173
It's going to sit over a bottle of champagne.

667
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,509
So he's got a business proposition for you.

668
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:34,344
I just sent you the back, all right?

669
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:36,480
- Billy? Tyrone?

670
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:38,015
- It's all right, it's all right.

671
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:39,316
You're with Tyrone now.

672
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:40,751
No problem.

673
00:48:40,784 --> 00:48:42,286
- Billy, are you listening to me?

674
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:45,856
- Why don't you go tell Tony to screw his brother, alright?

675
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:47,824
- Excuse me sir, it's from.

676
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:49,092
- Send it back.

677
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:51,261
- What are you doing Billy?

678
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:53,330
- Send it back.

679
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:54,598
Every now and then a new player

680
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:57,301
comes around working his way up the ladder.

681
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:59,636
Trying to buy in on my friendship,

682
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,238
trying to get in on what I got.

683
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:03,674
But I see through all that.

684
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:07,110
- Champagne's not to your liking?

685
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:08,512
Chardonnay perhaps.

686
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:09,379
- No, thanks.

687
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:14,051
My mama told me, never accept gifts from assholes.

688
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,687
- You know who goddamn I am.

689
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,055
- I don't give a shit who you are.

690
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:19,690
- I say she was at the wrong table.

691
00:49:19,723 --> 00:49:21,391
- I say, she's not.

692
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:22,259
- Sheila come on.

693
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:25,896
- [Billy] I do what I do to maintain respect.

694
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:27,798
And Tyrone always had my back.

695
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:33,970
In the same respect I had his,

696
00:49:34,004 --> 00:49:36,173
I never had to question that.

697
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:37,974
It's the law of the street.

698
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:40,644
He did for me, so I do for him.

699
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:45,816
- Anyway, listen, I got a favor to ask, you know.

700
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:47,017
- I gotta go to the bathroom.

701
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,788
- Stay here, we'll be right back.

702
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:00,263
- What's up Tyrone?

703
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:01,765
- Listen, man.

704
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:06,069
The mob thinks I stole $50,000 from him, man.

705
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:08,638
Listen, I know this cop who lives in the Hills, right?

706
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,674
All we have to do is go up there and get a lot of dope.

707
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:12,442
A lot of money, inside the desk drawer.

708
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:14,277
All I have to do is take it.

709
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:15,979
- Oh, come on Tyrone.

710
00:50:16,012 --> 00:50:18,281
The cops are after my tail already, man.

711
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:20,050
I got to lay low for awhile.

712
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:22,386
- Come on Billy, man.

713
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:25,055
I need you on this man.

714
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:27,424
With this one, exactly not stealing man.

715
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:29,159
And it'd be like, you don't want to go bar on it.

716
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:30,026
That's all.

717
00:50:31,828 --> 00:50:33,597
- Man, what's got into you anyways?

718
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,265
We're drug dealers not thieves.

719
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:36,666
You know that stuff's gonna kill you.

720
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,669
- Come on Billy man. Forget the stuff, I need you, man.

721
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:46,243
- If I do this, I'm doing it for you, all right?

722
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:48,512
Because I owe you.

723
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:51,014
- Thanks man. I really appreciate this man.

724
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:53,817
- Wipe your nose.

725
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:59,823
(dramatic music)

726
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:31,581
- [Billy] It's really strange how life works.

727
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:36,786
When I was a kid.

728
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,928
- Hey, there's Billy.

729
00:53:08,051 --> 00:53:09,486
- What's up dude.

730
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:14,191
- That's how I grew up.

731
00:53:16,192 --> 00:53:19,262
We can't be on the side of the fence.

732
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:26,937
I love you.

733
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,681
- I've got you something.

734
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,082
- Oh yeah?

735
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:40,116
Surprise?

736
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:40,951
- Yeah, surprise.

737
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:41,885
- Oh, I love surprise.

738
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:44,354
- It's not that. Close your eyes.

739
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,556
- Why? - - Close your eyes.

740
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,561
- It's better be good.

741
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:52,629
- Open your eyes.

742
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:53,496
- Hey Mario.

743
00:53:55,432 --> 00:53:58,001
- I'm gonna go to bed.

744
00:53:58,034 --> 00:53:58,868
- Mario,

745
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:02,038
where the hell are you man?

746
00:54:05,508 --> 00:54:08,211
Last time I heard you're in jail for 10 years.

747
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:09,245
You want a beer?

748
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:12,182
- Yeah. I could use some cold beer.

749
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:18,955
- Have a seat.

750
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:21,157
You haven't calling me these days.

751
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:23,360
- I'm sorry, I know.

752
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:25,762
Billy, remember all that crazy shit

753
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:27,163
we used to do when we were young.

754
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:30,934
- Yeah, how could I forget? I was a lot older than you too.

755
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:32,602
- I looked up to you back then.

756
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:35,538
Of you even,

757
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:36,906
used that Coke bottle,

758
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,142
that showed me how to put on a like condom.

759
00:54:39,175 --> 00:54:41,011
- I remember that.

760
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:43,113
- I came back here to say, thanks.

761
00:54:43,146 --> 00:54:46,750
- I thought you had about 10 or 12 years in the cat.

762
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,751
- Nah, they let me out

763
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,853
because it was too expensive to keep me.

764
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:52,489
- It's too expensive to keep your prison?

765
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:53,757
- Nah, not exactly.

766
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:56,493
See, I need a new liver.

767
00:54:57,661 --> 00:54:59,329
I got stab.

768
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:02,165
I mean, I was late paying my cigarettes

769
00:55:02,198 --> 00:55:04,034
and then I paid for what? A kidney.

770
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:05,301
- I'm gonna help you.

771
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:07,570
I helped you before, I'm going to help you now.

772
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:09,773
Say anything you need, you just come to me.

773
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:13,476
Hey, you want cigarette?

774
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:14,511
- Yeah, yeah.

775
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:26,690
(suspenseful music)

776
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:39,703
- Man what is that?

777
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:41,037
You're selling me out man?

778
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:43,473
You're my own flesh and blood man.

779
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,875
I considered you my brother.

780
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:47,577
You never rat on your friends.

781
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:50,180
I'm not gonna shoot you.

782
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:52,348
- They made me do it, man.

783
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:54,751
You're not gonna understand.

784
00:55:54,784 --> 00:55:56,653
But you have everything.

785
00:55:56,686 --> 00:56:00,090
Man, I was the big disappointment.

786
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,195
I'm fucked up, I messed up.

787
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:06,296
- Just look at you.

788
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:07,931
- Man, look at you.

789
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:09,966
With your beautiful girlfriend,

790
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:11,534
living in a beautiful house.

791
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:12,736
Driving a BMW.

792
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,840
You are everything I wanted to be.

793
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:20,844
My family?

794
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:24,347
They didn't show up to visit me in prison

795
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,415
when I got sentenced.

796
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:28,251
I am shit.

797
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:32,122
I am shit.

798
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:38,762
I'm no good in the can.

799
00:56:38,795 --> 00:56:39,996
They said they gonna send me back,

800
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:41,498
Billy you not understand.

801
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:43,500
- Who sent you?

802
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:45,502
Who sent you!

803
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:47,837
- Tahitian taskforce.

804
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,043
- I gonna kill you.

805
00:56:57,747 --> 00:56:58,948
Just get out of my face.

806
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:00,917
After that night,

807
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:04,621
I started to realize how little friends I had in the world.

808
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:06,222
My own cousin,

809
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,223
was a snitch.

810
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:10,093
What's this world turning into?

811
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:21,738
Tyrone, what's the matter with you, man.

812
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:22,672
You got stuff all over you.

813
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:24,507
Don't your mama take care of yourself.

814
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:27,343
- No, I'm just powder my nose, you know?

815
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:29,279
- Man, that stuff's going to kill you one day.

816
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:32,749
- Life is short Billy, you know, life is really short.

817
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,083
- Excuse me Billy, is everything all right in here?

818
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,319
- Everything is fine. Thank you.

819
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:37,821
- Billy, can we go now?

820
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:39,055
- Whoa, what's the matter with you.

821
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:41,791
Anyway, me and Billy got some business to discuss.

822
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:42,992
- It's Billy and I.

823
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:46,696
- Yeah, whatever. Anyway, we're still on, right?

824
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:48,498
- Yeah, we're still on.

825
00:57:48,531 --> 00:57:49,332
- I just want to make sure,

826
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:51,267
I don't want you to backing out now.

827
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:54,437
- Yeah, drop it.

828
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:56,906
- Okay, okay, I just trying to cover, you know,

829
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:59,843

830
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:02,712
- Are you going somewhere?

831
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:06,015
- Yeah, me and Billy have some business to attend to, okay?

832
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:07,550
- Let it go, Tyrone.

833
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:09,652
- Okay, okay man.

834
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:11,354
I'm just trying to make sure all the bases are covered.

835
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:13,122
I mean, before we'll make this deal.

836
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:18,161
- What deal?

837
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:21,164
What deal Billy?

838
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:28,838
- Anne wait!

839
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:32,742
Don't you ever, ever talk

840
00:58:32,775 --> 00:58:34,110
that trash again in front of her.

841
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:35,278
I'm gonna kill you!

842
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:37,280
- I love you too, Billy.

843
00:58:37,313 --> 00:58:39,382
Jeez, what's got into him?

844
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:45,321
- I don't like him Billy.

845
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,290
I didn't like him the minute I met him.

846
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:51,261
- He's a good friend of mine and.

847
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:54,797
- Was that asshole manipulating you into.

848
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:56,633
- I'm just helping him out, that's all.

849
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:58,234
Because I owe him.

850
00:58:58,268 --> 00:58:59,402
- You owe him?

851
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:01,170
He's a Cole kid, Billy.

852
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:03,306
I can't believe you hanging out with that guy.

853
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:04,807
He's going to get you killed.

854
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:11,814
I thought you were getting out.

855
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:14,884
- I am getting out, but it's just not that simple.

856
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:18,421
- No, you don't owe him shit. You just think you do.

857
00:59:19,822 --> 00:59:22,592
That's why people like you never get out.

858
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:24,494
- You are not listening to me!

859
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:26,396
- You're bullshitting me.

860
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:27,964
Everything you said is bullshit.

861
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:28,665
All your talk is bullshit.

862
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:29,632
Your dream are

863
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:32,936
bullshit. - - You're not listening to me.

864
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:41,577
It is just how it is.

865
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:42,946
Right or wrong.

866
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:53,423
- Whatever it is Billy.

867
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:56,159
Don't do it.

868
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:58,194
Please.

869
01:00:09,372 --> 01:00:12,375
(suspenseful music)

870
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:58,321
- I'm gonna check the room upstairs.

871
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:03,893
Hello Dave.

872
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:07,964
Fuck you Dave.

873
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,766
(guns firing)

874
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:10,967
- Damn Tyrone.

875
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,004
Tyrone, what the fuck did you do?

876
01:01:15,038 --> 01:01:16,873
Let's get out of here.

877
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:33,823
(cars revving)

878
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:35,425
I've got to get out.

879
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:37,360
It's not worth it anymore.

880
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:39,595
It catches up to you sooner or later.

881
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:45,001
Man, what the hell is wrong with you?

882
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:45,968
- What are you talking about, man?

883
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:47,970
If ain't kill him, he would've got me.

884
01:01:48,004 --> 01:01:49,872
You're the one talking about striking first.

885
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:51,841
Shoot, man.

886
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:52,675
- The girl.

887
01:01:52,708 --> 01:01:54,577
- What about her? Screaming as hell?

888
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:56,212
- She was innocent Tyrone.

889
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:58,314
- Innocent? Come on, man.

890
01:01:58,347 --> 01:02:00,349
Even the innocent still talk.

891
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,518
- To drugs, man. It's gonna get you killed.

892
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:04,921
- What's wrong with you, man?

893
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:07,423
The Kmart haven't closed out on your conscious of something.

894
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:09,292
I'm not used to you acting like this.

895
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:14,397
Man, I think you turning like a wuss.

896
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:17,533
- Oh, oh, I'm the wuss? I'm the wuss?

897
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:18,901
Who's the one that makes the money around here.

898
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:20,403
You smoked it before you can even sell it.

899
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:21,637
I'm the wuss!

900
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:22,738
- Yeah well, at least I ain't staying, running around here

901
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:24,273
panicking and stuff.

902
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:25,475
Man, I don't know what's gotten in you,

903
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:26,843
but it's not like you've never seen somebody

904
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:28,711
getting killed before.

905
01:02:28,744 --> 01:02:30,513
What is going on?

906
01:02:30,546 --> 01:02:31,380
What's up?

907
01:02:33,649 --> 01:02:35,751
- Tyrone, you lied to me.

908
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:39,355
You are making my world smaller and smaller.

909
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:41,958
I'm out there. I'm out!

910
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:42,925
- What you mean you out?

911
01:02:42,959 --> 01:02:44,560
Out of what?

912
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,496
What are you talking about?

913
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:48,698
What else you going to do, huh? Tell me.

914
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,201
- Damn it, I hate this business.

915
01:02:56,405 --> 01:02:58,074
- What else are you gonna do?

916
01:02:58,107 --> 01:03:00,076
You've been acting not yourself lately.

917
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:02,712
- I'm just worried Tyrone.

918
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:05,615
You're the only friend I got.

919
01:03:06,782 --> 01:03:08,184
And I'm worried,

920
01:03:08,217 --> 01:03:10,887
you're not going to reach the age of 30.

921
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,823
But you're on your own from now on.

922
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:28,004
(car revving)

923
01:04:10,479 --> 01:04:11,547
- Tie him up.

924
01:04:21,657 --> 01:04:22,692
- Got your boyfriend.

925
01:04:26,229 --> 01:04:29,098
- Ah, so you're the infamous Billy.

926
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,201
You're a hard guy to find Billy.

927
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:37,139
Billy, Billy, Billy, calm down, Billy.

928
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:42,345
You've killed some of my people.

929
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:44,013
Cost me some money.

930
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:45,014
I should kill you.

931
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:50,419
But I'm not going to, cause I like you.

932
01:04:50,453 --> 01:04:51,520
- Get to the point.

933
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:55,358
- I want you to join our organization.

934
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:56,726
- Why me?

935
01:04:56,759 --> 01:04:59,095
- With your skills and contacts.

936
01:05:00,162 --> 01:05:03,199
You could run the whole drug organization in LA.

937
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:05,868
- I'm planning on retiring soon.

938
01:05:05,901 --> 01:05:07,770
I got to think about it.

939
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:11,240
- I'm not a man who likes to wait for too long.

940
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:18,614
(indistinct)

941
01:05:37,667 --> 01:05:39,669
I swear, I've seen you somewhere before.

942
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:42,338
Where are you from?

943
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:45,574
- [Billy] I remember this guy clearly.

944
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,343
I'd never seen you before.

945
01:05:47,376 --> 01:05:50,913
Alex Alfredo, was the biggest bully in elementary school.

946
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:55,284
- Take him home.

947
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:07,997
(door thuds)

948
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:10,533
(car revving)

949
01:06:52,641 --> 01:06:53,442
- You don't owe him shit.

950
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:54,276
- You don't wanna change.

951
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:55,611
- I want you to have this.

952
01:06:55,644 --> 01:06:56,445
- What else you gonna do?

953
01:06:56,479 --> 01:06:57,546
- You've killed my baby!

954
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,749
- That's why people like you never get out.

955
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,525
- [Woman] Are you sure about this?

956
01:07:09,558 --> 01:07:10,393
- I'm positive.

957
01:07:11,327 --> 01:07:12,461
- So, what's you wanna do?

958
01:07:12,495 --> 01:07:13,562
- I can keep it.

959
01:07:13,596 --> 01:07:15,264
- You can't do this by yourself.

960
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:18,000
He's definitely not father material.

961
01:07:18,033 --> 01:07:19,068
Don't worry about it.

962
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:21,303
We'll deal with it.

963
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:23,139
- I don't.

964
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:25,241
- Speak of the devil Billy's here.

965
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:30,379
She doesn't wanna see you.

966
01:07:31,747 --> 01:07:32,782
- I need to talk.

967
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:34,650
- Billy, she doesn't wanna talk to you.

968
01:07:36,018 --> 01:07:37,286
- Please. I know you were right.

969
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:39,088
I know you're pissed off at me.

970
01:07:39,121 --> 01:07:39,922
Please. - - There's nothing

971
01:07:39,955 --> 01:07:40,823
to talk about Billy.

972
01:07:40,856 --> 01:07:41,857
- Anne, please,

973
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:44,293
I'm getting out I swear to God, I'm getting out.

974
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:45,795
- I'm late Billy, I'm late.

975
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:48,431
- Well, I'll take you there. Where are you gonna go?

976
01:07:54,503 --> 01:07:55,971
What? What do you mean you're late?

977
01:07:56,005 --> 01:07:57,973
Where you, you're pregnant?

978
01:07:58,007 --> 01:07:59,241
- Not for long.

979
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:02,344
- Wait a minute Anne. We've got to talk about this, please.

980
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:04,413
Anne, listen to me, I'm really getting it out.

981
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:06,148
Listen, we can get out of here.

982
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:07,349
We can get out of this rat race,

983
01:08:07,383 --> 01:08:09,952
let's fly to Boracay together, come on.

984
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:11,353
- What are you gonna do for work?

985
01:08:11,387 --> 01:08:12,455
- Well, I'm getting some money.

986
01:08:12,488 --> 01:08:14,223
We can open up a restaurant over there.

987
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:15,524
- What about Kate?

988
01:08:15,558 --> 01:08:16,659
- Of course she can come with us.

989
01:08:16,692 --> 01:08:18,894
There's a great school over there for her.

990
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,496
Please Anne.

991
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:24,300
Look, we have three plane tickets for us.

992
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:26,769
Three, we can fly tomorrow.

993
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:30,072
- It's happening so fast.

994
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,540
- Please Anne, please, listen.

995
01:08:31,574 --> 01:08:33,843
We just gotta get out of this rat race.

996
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:35,211
It's the only way out.

997
01:08:36,512 --> 01:08:37,346
What do you say?

998
01:08:40,883 --> 01:08:41,717
- Okay.

999
01:08:42,651 --> 01:08:43,719
- All right, okay.

1000
01:08:43,752 --> 01:08:45,754
Say goodbye to whoever you have to say goodbye to.

1001
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:48,991
Okay? And meet me at my house tomorrow.

1002
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:50,192
I'm just going to pick up my money

1003
01:08:50,226 --> 01:08:51,660
and I'll meet you there, okay?

1004
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:53,863
Pack my clothes for me, okay?

1005
01:08:53,896 --> 01:08:54,697
- All right.

1006
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:56,499
- All right, I love you.

1007
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:57,967
- I love you too.

1008
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:13,682
- They took down little Ray. He took him down.

1009
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:14,717
You're not going to do anything about it?

1010
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:17,786
What in the hell are you guys gonna do about it?

1011
01:09:19,588 --> 01:09:20,422
Yes?

1012
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:30,533
How many times do I have to repeat myself with you, huh?

1013
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:32,401
- Well, don't.

1014
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:33,369
- Whoa, whoa, let's go!

1015
01:09:33,402 --> 01:09:34,470
Out! Out! Out!

1016
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:36,038
- Fine!

1017
01:09:36,071 --> 01:09:37,039
- Know what man.

1018
01:09:38,974 --> 01:09:39,842
Get her out!

1019
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:40,976
- I hate you!

1020
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:46,315
- You better eluded bitch outta here.

1021
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:50,452
This building has been more trouble

1022
01:09:50,486 --> 01:09:52,655
than any two bit hustler that I have ever met.

1023
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:54,590
- I think it's time to take him out of business.

1024
01:09:54,623 --> 01:09:56,025
- You know Junior?

1025
01:09:56,058 --> 01:09:57,159
I think you're right.

1026
01:09:59,161 --> 01:10:01,263
- It would be my pleasure.

1027
01:10:02,665 --> 01:10:04,099
- [Tony] What about his partner?

1028
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:05,534
- Take him down.

1029
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:07,036
But I want Billy brought back here.

1030
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:09,205
- Damn it! Why don't you just let me take him out?

1031
01:10:09,238 --> 01:10:10,306
Why you want to bring him back here?

1032
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:12,942
- I said, I don't want him back here alive!

1033
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:14,310
- [Junior] Come on, come on.

1034
01:10:15,444 --> 01:10:18,547
- You tell her to get in here and clean this crap up.

1035
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:23,319
(dramatic music)

1036
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,495
- Why are you not packing?

1037
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:07,396
We're going away.

1038
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:10,232
So you go pack your things too.

1039
01:11:12,267 --> 01:11:13,602
What's the matter Kate?

1040
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:16,672
(indistinct)

1041
01:11:16,705 --> 01:11:17,539
- Kate,

1042
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:21,176
you know I love you.

1043
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:22,044
You're my sister.

1044
01:11:23,078 --> 01:11:25,147
We're the only family we've got.

1045
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:26,115
We're a team, okay?

1046
01:11:29,752 --> 01:11:31,253
Now, go pack you things.

1047
01:11:31,286 --> 01:11:32,721
- Can I bring my stuff animals?

1048
01:11:32,755 --> 01:11:34,857
- You can bring one.

1049
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:36,825
- Can I bring two?

1050
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:38,894
- Okay, hurry up. Go pack your things.

1051
01:11:57,112 --> 01:11:59,248
- Judy, I just came here to say goodbye.

1052
01:12:01,116 --> 01:12:02,851
I don't know how long I'll be gone.

1053
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:07,623
I just want to say goodbye before I leave.

1054
01:12:09,792 --> 01:12:14,229
I just want you to understand what I got to do.

1055
01:12:14,263 --> 01:12:16,031
And give this to your brother Jeff.

1056
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:19,635
Tell him I'm sorry.

1057
01:12:26,075 --> 01:12:27,476
Tell him that I do love him.

1058
01:12:28,877 --> 01:12:29,778
Come on, now.

1059
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:47,096
You're gonna be strong Judy, okay? Be strong.

1060
01:12:48,063 --> 01:12:49,598
Dear Jeff,

1061
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:52,501
I know you blame me for how your life is right now.

1062
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:54,269
I can't change the past.

1063
01:12:54,303 --> 01:12:56,405
I've made many mistakes in this world

1064
01:12:56,438 --> 01:12:57,873
and if I had a choice,

1065
01:12:57,906 --> 01:12:59,942
I would have done things different,

1066
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:01,143
but I can't.

1067
01:13:01,176 --> 01:13:02,811
I'm leaving for good.

1068
01:13:02,845 --> 01:13:06,615
I hope one day you'll find it in your heart to forgive me.

1069
01:13:06,648 --> 01:13:09,218
You'll always be my brother, Billy.

1070
01:13:11,253 --> 01:13:13,756
(car revving)

1071
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:26,201
(suspenseful music)

1072
01:13:27,202 --> 01:13:28,604
- What are these clowns for?

1073
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:34,643
- Hey, how are you doing there buddy?

1074
01:13:34,676 --> 01:13:36,111
- How'd you doing officer?

1075
01:13:36,145 --> 01:13:40,649
- [Police] Can you please shut your engine, all right?

1076
01:13:43,852 --> 01:13:47,089
- All right, what seems to be the problem officer?

1077
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:48,223
- [Police] My partner will talk to you in a second.

1078
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:50,459
Why don't you keep your hands on the steering wheel.

1079
01:13:50,492 --> 01:13:51,860
- All right.

1080
01:13:51,894 --> 01:13:52,728
- Thank you.

1081
01:13:54,997 --> 01:13:56,165
- Afternoon, sir.

1082
01:13:56,198 --> 01:13:57,132
- Good afternoon.

1083
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:58,667
- My name is officer Dickson

1084
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:00,335
and the reason why we stopped you

1085
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:01,603
is because you were speeding.

1086
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:03,438
- I didn't know it was going that fast.

1087
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:06,141
- So, if you just give me your license and registration.

1088
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:06,975
I'll be right back.

1089
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:08,177
- No, problem.

1090
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:09,478
- Oh, hey.

1091
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:10,846
- I'm just getting my wallet.

1092
01:14:10,879 --> 01:14:12,247
It's in the glove compartment.

1093
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:13,081
- Okay.

1094
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:13,916
- All right.

1095
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:15,017
- No bazookas or anything crazy.

1096
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:19,221
- No, no, I ain't no criminal.

1097
01:14:23,258 --> 01:14:24,760
- Okay, sit tight.

1098
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:37,172
- Run this guy from one to one.

1099
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:15,644
- All right, here you go. Don't speed up okay?

1100
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:17,012
- No problem, officer. Thank you.

1101
01:15:17,045 --> 01:15:18,013
- Have a good day.

1102
01:15:18,046 --> 01:15:18,847
- [Billy] I wasn't sure if I had been linked

1103
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:20,449
to Kuziak's death.

1104
01:15:20,482 --> 01:15:22,684
It was just a matter of time when they will.

1105
01:15:24,052 --> 01:15:25,721
I didn't even get a ticket.

1106
01:15:25,754 --> 01:15:27,656
Now, That was pure luck.

1107
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,247
- Hey, there's Billy.

1108
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:54,750
(car revving)

1109
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:07,296
(suspenseful music)

1110
01:17:14,596 --> 01:17:16,331
- Oh yeah, all right.

1111
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:22,638
- No, no, no, no.

1112
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:25,273
Get the hell out of here.

1113
01:17:27,109 --> 01:17:27,943
- Wait, wait.

1114
01:17:29,611 --> 01:17:30,445
- Get up.

1115
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:46,828
(guns firing)

1116
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:04,246
(suspenseful music)

1117
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:56,164
- Hey, get the door.

1118
01:19:16,785 --> 01:19:19,287
(guns firing)

1119
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:43,979
(guns firing)

1120
01:22:59,274 --> 01:23:00,075
- There he is.

1121
01:23:00,108 --> 01:23:01,109
- That's son of a bitch is mine.

1122
01:23:01,142 --> 01:23:03,645
(guns firing)

1123
01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:22,697
Where'd he go?

1124
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:28,903
(guns firing)

1125
01:23:42,083 --> 01:23:44,052
- Run on the other side.

1126
01:24:11,179 --> 01:24:11,980
Billy!

1127
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:16,184
- [Junior] Take your gun off my brother Billy.

1128
01:24:20,088 --> 01:24:21,589
Get on your knees.

1129
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:29,784
- Okay, we need to hurry.

1130
01:26:29,817 --> 01:26:31,719
Flight leaves in an hour.

1131
01:26:31,753 --> 01:26:32,987
- Kate, go get your coat.

1132
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:36,691
- Anne, I will never break your heart.

1133
01:26:54,442 --> 01:26:59,447
Tickets? You got the tickets.

1134
01:26:59,681 --> 01:27:02,250
- You've killed my baby!

1135
01:27:02,283 --> 01:27:04,786
(guns firing)

1136
01:27:06,154 --> 01:27:06,988
- No!

1137
01:27:10,024 --> 01:27:10,858
No!

1138
01:27:15,496 --> 01:27:17,465
- [Billy] I never knew it was going to end up this way.

1139
01:27:18,299 --> 01:27:20,435
But there's always a reason for everything.

1140
01:27:21,502 --> 01:27:23,204
I could have made Anne happy.

1141
01:27:24,138 --> 01:27:25,473
I was so close.

1142
01:27:26,474 --> 01:27:29,410
But I guess I did too many bad things

1143
01:27:29,444 --> 01:27:30,945
in this world to have made it.

1144
01:27:34,349 --> 01:27:35,183
- No!

1145
01:27:36,317 --> 01:27:39,087
(dramatic music)

1146
01:27:49,664 --> 01:27:50,498
No!

1147
01:28:16,290 --> 01:28:17,892
- [Billy] I guess it's true.

1148
01:28:17,925 --> 01:28:21,095
What you put out in this world is what you get back.

1149
01:28:22,397 --> 01:28:25,166
(dramatic music)
