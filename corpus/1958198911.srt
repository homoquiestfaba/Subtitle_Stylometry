1
00:01:50,546 --> 00:01:52,481
Watch it!

2
00:01:52,515 --> 00:01:53,616
More harpoons!

3
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:55,083
Ready the nets, men!

4
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:57,453
I say kill her 'afore
she comes aboard!

5
00:01:57,486 --> 00:01:58,521
Where is she? Let me see!

6
00:01:59,288 --> 00:02:00,989
Wait. Wait. Wait.

7
00:02:02,758 --> 00:02:04,192
She's a fast one.

8
00:02:04,226 --> 00:02:06,762
- Hand me another!
- She's getting away!

9
00:02:06,796 --> 00:02:08,397
I think
she's smilin' at you.

10
00:02:10,766 --> 00:02:12,867
I missed her.

11
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:14,537
Another one.
Come on,
another one!

12
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,840
Hey! Hey! Hey!

13
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:21,009
Move! Move! Get back!

14
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:22,077
What are you doing?

15
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,845
It's a mermaid!
A mermaid?

16
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:25,146
Use your eyes!

17
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:29,652
What were you thinking?

18
00:02:29,685 --> 00:02:30,952
These are
dangerous waters.

19
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:32,987
And this
is a dangerous time.

20
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:34,923
Tonight's the Coral Moon.

21
00:02:34,956 --> 00:02:36,826
They say this is
when the Sea King calls

22
00:02:36,858 --> 00:02:38,927
his mermaid
daughters together

23
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,629
to lure men
to their deaths.

24
00:02:40,663 --> 00:02:41,863
Is that
what they say?
Aye.

25
00:02:41,896 --> 00:02:44,633
Not even the strongest
can resist their spell.

26
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:45,934
It's just
an old lore.

27
00:02:51,741 --> 00:02:53,007
Back to work!

28
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,410
Come on, lads.
You see there?

29
00:02:54,443 --> 00:02:55,778
See what, Hawkins?

30
00:02:55,811 --> 00:02:58,947
Crosswind gust kicked up
the chop, that's all.

31
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,915
That's the
Sea King's doing.
Give me a hand, mate.

32
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:03,252
He'd pull us
under himself
if he could.

33
00:03:03,285 --> 00:03:05,454
- Sail faster!
- Raising the main!

34
00:03:05,488 --> 00:03:06,555
This line's tight.

35
00:03:07,456 --> 00:03:08,591
Where's Prince Eric?

36
00:03:08,624 --> 00:03:11,893
Up at the bow,
Sir Grimsby.

37
00:03:15,498 --> 00:03:17,299
Whoo!
Eric!

38
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:19,702
What are you
doing out there?

39
00:03:19,735 --> 00:03:21,404
Get back here at once!

40
00:03:21,437 --> 00:03:24,139
You ought to stop worrying
so much about me, Grimsby.

41
00:03:24,172 --> 00:03:26,342
Call me selfish,

42
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,244
but I do not want
to tell the Queen

43
00:03:28,277 --> 00:03:31,079
that her son fell
overboard on my watch.

44
00:03:31,112 --> 00:03:33,315
And on his birthday,
of all days.

45
00:03:35,418 --> 00:03:37,520
Looks like there's
a Spanish galleon out there

46
00:03:37,553 --> 00:03:38,854
headed toward the mainland.

47
00:03:38,888 --> 00:03:40,423
We could
follow it to port,

48
00:03:40,456 --> 00:03:42,358
see what
they've brought
to trade.

49
00:03:42,391 --> 00:03:45,327
Our ship is loaded
to the gills as it is.

50
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:47,061
We've risked
our necks out here

51
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:48,930
for seven
weeks already.

52
00:03:48,963 --> 00:03:51,467
We're going
home tonight.

53
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,001
Eric.

54
00:03:53,034 --> 00:03:54,570
Pay attention.

55
00:03:54,603 --> 00:03:55,937
I need you
to be more careful.

56
00:03:57,473 --> 00:03:59,073
Careful, Grimsby!

57
00:05:56,325 --> 00:05:59,093
My Daughters
of the Seven Seas,

58
00:05:59,127 --> 00:06:01,564
I welcome news
from all of your waters.

59
00:06:02,765 --> 00:06:05,034
Tamika, Perla,

60
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:06,802
it's so good
to see you.

61
00:06:08,537 --> 00:06:10,539
Caspia, Indira,

62
00:06:10,573 --> 00:06:13,976
it fills my heart
to have you all here.

63
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:15,210
Mala,

64
00:06:15,844 --> 00:06:17,446
Karina...

65
00:06:22,217 --> 00:06:24,085
Where is Ariel?

66
00:06:27,723 --> 00:06:29,258
Sebastian?

67
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:33,295
You were supposed
to see to it
that Ariel was here.

68
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:35,931
I tried,
Your Majesty,

69
00:06:35,965 --> 00:06:38,233
but that child,
she is impossible.

70
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:40,101
I reminded her

71
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:42,504
about the gathering
just this mornin'.

72
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:44,740
What more can
one crustacean do?

73
00:06:46,008 --> 00:06:48,176
You can go find her.

74
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,745
Yes, Your Majesty.
Yes.

75
00:06:49,778 --> 00:06:51,112
Right away.

76
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,215
"Yes, Your Majesty.

77
00:06:53,248 --> 00:06:54,783
"Right away,
Your Majesty."

78
00:06:54,817 --> 00:06:57,653
How hard can it be
to find a mermaid,
after all?

79
00:06:57,686 --> 00:07:00,322
If I'm lucky,
I'll only have
to search one ocean.

80
00:07:01,056 --> 00:07:04,560
Where are you, child?

81
00:07:28,984 --> 00:07:32,153
We aren't supposed
to be this far
from the palace, Ariel.

82
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:33,889
- Let's go back.
- Oh!

83
00:07:33,922 --> 00:07:35,457
How does that work?

84
00:07:35,491 --> 00:07:37,660
Come on, Ariel.
Please?

85
00:07:37,693 --> 00:07:40,763
Oh, Flounder,
stop being such a guppy!

86
00:07:40,796 --> 00:07:42,364
I'm not a guppy.

87
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:52,875
I think
we've gone
far enough.

88
00:07:55,711 --> 00:07:56,812
Wait.

89
00:07:56,845 --> 00:07:58,480
What is that?

90
00:07:58,514 --> 00:08:00,315
I've never seen that one.

91
00:08:02,418 --> 00:08:03,585
Come on.

92
00:08:03,619 --> 00:08:05,387
Ariel! Wait for me!

93
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:10,392
You know
I can't swim
that fast.

94
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:30,012
Whoa. Look at all that.

95
00:08:30,045 --> 00:08:33,549
They must have used
the ship for battles
or something.

96
00:08:33,582 --> 00:08:35,384
Yeah, great.

97
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:37,086
Now let's get
out of here.

98
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,321
Getting cold fins?
Who, me?

99
00:08:39,822 --> 00:08:41,423
No way.
Good.

100
00:08:41,457 --> 00:08:44,893
Then you can stay out here
and watch for sharks.

101
00:08:44,927 --> 00:08:46,395
All right, good.

102
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:48,130
What?

103
00:08:48,163 --> 00:08:49,932
Ariel, wait!

104
00:09:04,012 --> 00:09:06,415
Do you really think
there might be
sharks around here?

105
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:08,484
Oh, Flounder.

106
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,422
Look at this.

107
00:09:13,455 --> 00:09:14,389
Whoa.

108
00:09:14,423 --> 00:09:16,925
It's the smallest trident
I've ever seen.

109
00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:20,462
I'm King Flounder,

110
00:09:20,496 --> 00:09:23,332
Lord of the Seven Seas!

111
00:09:23,365 --> 00:09:26,135
I wonder why
a human would
need one that size.

112
00:09:26,168 --> 00:09:27,870
I bet Scuttle will know.

113
00:09:27,903 --> 00:09:29,505
She always does.

114
00:09:32,174 --> 00:09:33,442
Will you relax?

115
00:09:33,475 --> 00:09:36,044
It's just
your reflection.
Whew.

116
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:37,446
Calm down.

117
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:40,015
Nothing is going to happen.

118
00:09:40,816 --> 00:09:41,817
Flounder, look out!

119
00:10:16,785 --> 00:10:17,886
Flounder!

120
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:05,033
You okay,
Flounder?

121
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:05,901
Uh, sure.

122
00:11:05,934 --> 00:11:08,370
I mean,
I've seen bigger sharks.

123
00:11:08,403 --> 00:11:10,572
Just, you know,
you can't back down.

124
00:11:10,606 --> 00:11:12,908
You gotta show 'em
who's in...

125
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,379
Come back, Flounder.
It's just Scuttle.

126
00:11:25,187 --> 00:11:27,923
Ariel. Hey, kid,
how ya doin'?

127
00:11:27,956 --> 00:11:30,158
Don't mind me,
I was just
grabbin' a snack.

128
00:11:30,192 --> 00:11:31,760
Scuttle, we found
more treasure.

129
00:11:31,793 --> 00:11:33,996
Yeah. We went
into this sunken ship,

130
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:35,464
and it was
really creepy.

131
00:11:35,497 --> 00:11:37,367
Human stuff. A-ha.

132
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,433
All right,
all right,
let me see.

133
00:11:38,467 --> 00:11:39,902
Let... Let...
Let me see.

134
00:11:39,935 --> 00:11:41,204
Any idea what this is?

135
00:11:41,237 --> 00:11:43,239
Oh. Oh, oh, oh!

136
00:11:43,273 --> 00:11:44,740
Wow.

137
00:11:44,773 --> 00:11:45,841
This...

138
00:11:45,874 --> 00:11:47,243
This is... Yeah.

139
00:11:47,277 --> 00:11:48,810
This is very,
very unusual.

140
00:11:48,844 --> 00:11:51,314
What? What is it?
It's a...

141
00:11:51,347 --> 00:11:53,216
It's a dinglehopper.

142
00:11:53,249 --> 00:11:54,783
A dinglehopper.
Yeah. Yeah.

143
00:11:54,816 --> 00:11:58,720
Humans use these babies
to style their hair.

144
00:11:58,754 --> 00:12:00,155
You just give it
a little twirl,

145
00:12:00,188 --> 00:12:02,758
a little yank,
you might get
some pieces with it,

146
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,726
and you're left with
an artistically pleasing

147
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,330
conflagration of hair
that humans go nuts for.

148
00:12:07,363 --> 00:12:09,932
Really?
I would love
to see that.

149
00:12:09,965 --> 00:12:11,334
Can't.
Flounder.

150
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:12,668
You know it's true.

151
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:15,037
Your father still won't let
you go to the surface, huh?

152
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,306
No, it's forbidden.

153
00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:18,640
He thinks all humans
are barbarians.

154
00:12:18,674 --> 00:12:21,210
Oh, they're not so bad.

155
00:12:21,244 --> 00:12:22,978
Unless you're a coconut.

156
00:12:23,011 --> 00:12:24,112
They hate coconuts.

157
00:12:24,146 --> 00:12:25,781
I swear, they get
a hold of one,

158
00:12:25,814 --> 00:12:28,517
they smash it to pieces,
just like that. It's weird.

159
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,185
- And what's this?
- Ariel!

160
00:12:30,219 --> 00:12:31,486
Swam half across

161
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,121
a whole ocean lookin'
for this child. Ariel!

162
00:12:33,155 --> 00:12:34,189
Ow!

163
00:12:34,223 --> 00:12:35,258
Sebastian!

164
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,492
- Sorry about that!
- Ariel!

165
00:12:37,526 --> 00:12:39,494
What are you
doin' up there?

166
00:12:39,528 --> 00:12:41,563
Wasting your time
with this
know-nothing bird

167
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:43,465
that can't tell
swimmin' from flyin'?

168
00:12:43,498 --> 00:12:45,701
Hey!
I suppose you've completely

169
00:12:45,734 --> 00:12:48,338
forgotten tonight's
the Coral Moon?

170
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:49,405
Oh, no!

171
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:50,706
Oh, yes!

172
00:12:50,739 --> 00:12:53,008
The gatherin'
of King Triton's daughters,

173
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:53,875
minus one.

174
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:55,877
My father's gonna kill me!

175
00:12:55,911 --> 00:12:57,713
Sorry, Scuttle,
gotta go!
Yeah, yeah.

176
00:12:57,746 --> 00:12:59,415
All right, sweetie.
Me too.

177
00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:00,482
Gotta get some air.

178
00:13:16,798 --> 00:13:20,035
<i>Yes,</i>
<i>hurry home, Princess.</i>

179
00:13:20,736 --> 00:13:21,770
<i>We wouldn't want to be late</i>

180
00:13:21,803 --> 00:13:24,673
<i>for Daddy's gathering,</i>
<i>now, would we?</i>

181
00:13:25,674 --> 00:13:28,043
Perhaps I'll join them.

182
00:13:28,076 --> 00:13:31,280
Oh, wait, what a shame.

183
00:13:31,314 --> 00:13:33,416
It seems that
Big Brother forgot

184
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:36,818
to invite Auntie Ursula
to the party.

185
00:13:36,852 --> 00:13:38,254
Again.

186
00:13:38,287 --> 00:13:41,023
Oh, I should be the one
throwing the parties,

187
00:13:41,056 --> 00:13:44,126
not waiting
on an invitation.

188
00:13:45,694 --> 00:13:49,332
Oh, the feasts we had
when I lived in the palace!

189
00:13:53,403 --> 00:13:57,373
And now look at me,
the family pariah.

190
00:13:57,407 --> 00:14:00,942
Wasting away
to practically nothing.

191
00:14:00,976 --> 00:14:04,813
Banished and exiled,
driven halfway to madness

192
00:14:04,846 --> 00:14:10,652
in this dim little crevice
for 15 long years.

193
00:14:11,753 --> 00:14:15,190
While Daddy
and his spoiled
little mer-brats

194
00:14:15,224 --> 00:14:17,260
celebrate the Coral Moon.

195
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,831
Well, I'll give them
something to celebrate.

196
00:14:24,434 --> 00:14:27,803
I may have finally found
Daddy's weakness.

197
00:14:28,438 --> 00:14:30,406
Yes.

198
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,278
Red's fascination with humans
might be just the opening

199
00:14:35,311 --> 00:14:37,846
I've been waiting for.

200
00:14:40,249 --> 00:14:41,883
It is irresponsible.

201
00:14:41,917 --> 00:14:43,319
Your sisters are only here

202
00:14:43,352 --> 00:14:44,953
for one phase
of the Coral Moon.

203
00:14:44,986 --> 00:14:46,222
Can you imagine
any one of them

204
00:14:46,255 --> 00:14:49,392
- missing the gathering?
- No. You're right.

205
00:14:49,425 --> 00:14:51,726
I'm sorry.
It wasn't Ariel's fault.

206
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,563
We... We...
We were exploring,

207
00:14:53,595 --> 00:14:54,863
and a shark
chased us and...

208
00:14:54,896 --> 00:14:55,931
Shark?

209
00:14:55,964 --> 00:14:57,866
So, you went
to the shipwrecks again?

210
00:14:59,235 --> 00:15:01,036
Those waters
are dangerous.

211
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:02,572
You don't have
to worry about me.

212
00:15:02,604 --> 00:15:04,840
Well, I do worry,
my little one.
I do worry.

213
00:15:04,873 --> 00:15:06,908
This obsession
with humans
has to stop.

214
00:15:06,942 --> 00:15:09,278
I just want
to know more
about them.

215
00:15:09,312 --> 00:15:10,513
You know all
you need to know.

216
00:15:10,546 --> 00:15:11,813
I barely know anything.

217
00:15:11,847 --> 00:15:13,648
You won't even
let us go
to the surface.

218
00:15:13,682 --> 00:15:15,750
Why do you have
to be so strong-minded?

219
00:15:15,784 --> 00:15:17,652
Just like
your mother. It...
I am her daughter.

220
00:15:17,686 --> 00:15:19,522
Yes, foolish enough
to be taken

221
00:15:19,555 --> 00:15:20,655
with the human world.

222
00:15:20,689 --> 00:15:22,325
If you would just try
to understand...

223
00:15:22,358 --> 00:15:23,559
Well, I have tried.

224
00:15:23,593 --> 00:15:25,193
I have tried
to understand you
long enough.

225
00:15:25,228 --> 00:15:27,129
But as long
as you live
in my ocean,

226
00:15:27,162 --> 00:15:28,763
you'll obey my rules.

227
00:15:28,797 --> 00:15:30,699
Do you understand that?

228
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:45,714
Children,
you give them
an inch,

229
00:15:45,747 --> 00:15:47,517
they swim
all over you.

230
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,218
Was I too hard on her?

231
00:15:49,252 --> 00:15:50,419
Definitely not.

232
00:15:50,453 --> 00:15:51,987
It's like I always say,

233
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,923
"Children got to live
by their parent's rules."

234
00:15:54,956 --> 00:15:57,326
You're absolutely
right, Sebastian.

235
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,528
Hmm.

236
00:15:58,561 --> 00:16:00,630
My Ariel needs
constant supervision.

237
00:16:00,662 --> 00:16:01,863
Constant.

238
00:16:01,897 --> 00:16:03,399
Someone to watch over her.

239
00:16:03,432 --> 00:16:05,501
All the time,
day and night.

240
00:16:05,535 --> 00:16:07,303
And you're just the crab
to do it.

241
00:16:07,336 --> 00:16:08,371
I am just the crab to...

242
00:16:08,404 --> 00:16:09,771
No, wait,
that's not... What?

243
00:16:09,804 --> 00:16:11,740
No, see, I serve you,
Your Majesty,

244
00:16:11,773 --> 00:16:14,243
as your honored majordomo.

245
00:16:14,277 --> 00:16:16,044
There is no better way
you can serve me

246
00:16:16,077 --> 00:16:17,613
than to make sure
my little one

247
00:16:17,647 --> 00:16:18,747
stays out of trouble.

248
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,349
- But I...
- Yes?

249
00:16:20,383 --> 00:16:21,384
Go.

250
00:16:22,585 --> 00:16:23,685
Go.

251
00:16:23,718 --> 00:16:26,988
Yes, Your Majesty.

252
00:16:27,022 --> 00:16:28,924
How do I get myself
into these situations?

253
00:16:28,957 --> 00:16:31,026
I'm an educated crustacean.

254
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:32,261
I got options.

255
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:33,496
I don't need this.

256
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:34,796
I should be
advising the King,

257
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:37,766
not chasing after
some headstrong teenager.

258
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:14,670
Ariel,
are you okay?

259
00:17:14,704 --> 00:17:16,405
He doesn't even
hear me.

260
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:18,840
I'm just
not like him.

261
00:17:18,873 --> 00:17:21,009
I don't see things
the way he does.

262
00:17:22,311 --> 00:17:23,778
And I...

263
00:17:23,812 --> 00:17:26,716
I don't see
how a world
that makes

264
00:17:26,748 --> 00:17:30,353

could be so bad.

21 years ago,

348

the King and Queen
took you in

349

as one of their own.

Come here, boy!

354
00:23:36,117 --> 00:23:37,319
Come on. Come on.

355
00:23:38,354 --> 00:23:39,321
Go on.

356
00:23:39,355 --> 00:23:40,956
And now
that you have come of age,

357
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,993
your responsibilities
are at home.

358
00:23:44,026 --> 00:23:45,427
Your father would
have expected that.

359
00:23:45,461 --> 00:23:47,229
Yes, trapped inside
that castle

360
00:23:47,262 --> 00:23:48,897
in isolation and fear.

361
00:23:49,732 --> 00:23:50,899
I can't do it.

362
00:23:50,933 --> 00:23:52,801
I believe a little
fear may be advisable, sire.

363
00:23:52,835 --> 00:23:54,536
Grimsby,
you're not listening.

364
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:56,405
I want to be
a different kind of leader.

365
00:23:56,438 --> 00:23:58,040
That's the whole reason
we're on this voyage,

366
00:23:58,073 --> 00:23:59,708
don't you see?

367
00:23:59,742 --> 00:24:01,510
We have to stay open
to what's out here.

368
00:24:01,543 --> 00:24:04,213
That's the only way
our island can grow.

369
00:24:04,246 --> 00:24:06,682
Eric,
think what you risk.

370
00:24:06,715 --> 00:24:08,250
I can't explain it, Grims.

371
00:24:08,283 --> 00:24:10,151
It's in my blood.

372
00:24:10,184 --> 00:24:12,254
Even now...

373
00:24:12,287 --> 00:24:14,957
I feel there's something
out here calling to me.

374
00:24:18,694 --> 00:24:20,462
Storm coming in fast.

375
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:25,834
- Squall coming in!
- Squall!

376
00:24:25,868 --> 00:24:27,069
All hands on deck!

377
00:24:27,102 --> 00:24:28,370
All hands on deck!

378
00:24:28,404 --> 00:24:30,105
Batten down the hatches
and crates!

379
00:24:30,139 --> 00:24:31,340
Yes, sir!

380
00:24:32,307 --> 00:24:33,342
Tie 'em down!

381
00:24:35,577 --> 00:24:37,579
Get the ropes in!
Tie her down!

382
00:24:37,613 --> 00:24:40,282
Man the pumps!
Man the pumps!

383
00:24:40,315 --> 00:24:42,651
- Pull the main sail!

384
00:24:47,322 --> 00:24:49,190
Clew up
and stow the main course!

385
00:24:49,224 --> 00:24:50,993
We're over-canvassed!

386
00:24:51,026 --> 00:24:52,728
Brail up
the foresail!

387
00:25:04,673 --> 00:25:06,308
Stow all of the sails!

388
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,244
Clew that!

389
00:25:12,948 --> 00:25:14,950
Drop it down.
Open up!

390
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:42,111
Oi, lads!

391
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,746
Fire!

392
00:25:49,219 --> 00:25:50,686
Grab the port side!

393
00:26:00,596 --> 00:26:03,031
Lifeboats!
Abandon ship!

394
00:26:03,065 --> 00:26:04,133
Abandon ship!

395
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:05,567
Abandon ship!

396
00:26:05,601 --> 00:26:07,102
Into the water, boy!

397
00:26:07,136 --> 00:26:08,737
- Go! Now!
- Jump!

398
00:26:09,638 --> 00:26:10,773
Get in. Get in!

399
00:26:10,806 --> 00:26:12,174
Jump!

400
00:26:27,223 --> 00:26:28,457
Give me
your hand, boy.

401
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,159
Come on, get up.
Hold on!

402
00:26:30,192 --> 00:26:32,060
Boy! In here.
All right?

403
00:26:33,263 --> 00:26:35,497
Max.

404
00:26:53,382 --> 00:26:56,351
That's it. That's it, boy.
Come on, boy. That's it.

405
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,989
All right, boy.
Go on. Go on.

406
00:27:05,127 --> 00:27:06,628
Come here, boy!

407
00:27:06,662 --> 00:27:08,597
- Max! Come on!
- Good boy!

408
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,405
Come on.

409
00:27:16,438 --> 00:27:17,840
Come on, Max.

410
00:27:17,873 --> 00:27:18,907
There you go.

411
00:27:18,941 --> 00:27:21,076
I got ya.
Eric!

412
00:29:15,258 --> 00:29:17,260
Oh, no.

413
00:29:17,293 --> 00:29:19,895
Ahh! Get off me,
you fool!

414
00:29:19,928 --> 00:29:22,731
Oh, hey.
Didn't expect
to find you here.

415
00:29:22,764 --> 00:29:25,335
And I really
didn't expect
to find her here.

416
00:29:25,368 --> 00:29:27,437
Uh-uh. Hey.
You listen to me, bird.

417
00:29:27,469 --> 00:29:29,805
The King can never
hear of this.

418
00:29:29,838 --> 00:29:32,674
We are going to forget
this ever happened.

419
00:29:32,708 --> 00:29:34,843
Ow!
Are you
listenin' to me?

420
00:29:34,876 --> 00:29:35,777
Yes.

421
00:29:35,811 --> 00:29:38,113
You won't tell him,
I won't tell him,

422
00:29:38,146 --> 00:29:40,450
and I will stay
in one piece.
You got it?

423
00:29:40,482 --> 00:29:42,884
Got it. Sorry,
what'd you say again?

424
00:29:42,918 --> 00:29:44,287

00:31:07,069 --> 00:31:08,170
He's alive.

00:31:09,938 --> 00:31:12,174

No, it's too easy.

457
00:32:08,897 --> 00:32:11,800
She's already in love
with the human world

458
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:14,403
and now she found
her soulmate.

459
00:32:14,437 --> 00:32:15,837
Ugh.

460
00:32:15,871 --> 00:32:18,673
Oh, wait until
Daddy finds out.

461
00:32:18,707 --> 00:32:21,277
He's gonna
hit the surface.

462
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:24,413
That little girl's
gonna run straight

463
00:32:24,447 --> 00:32:27,250
into my tentacles.

464
00:32:27,283 --> 00:32:30,685
Then I'll use her
as a prawn
in my little game

465
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:34,723
and finally get to rip
the power away from Triton

466
00:32:34,756 --> 00:32:37,926
that should've been
mine all along.

467
00:32:42,465 --> 00:32:44,065
All right.

468
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:45,468
Okay.

469
00:32:45,501 --> 00:32:47,503
As long as the King
never finds out,

470
00:32:47,537 --> 00:32:49,771
everything will be
all right.

471
00:32:49,804 --> 00:32:51,207
He never has
to know she used

472
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,876
that precious siren song
of hers to save a human.

473
00:32:56,011 --> 00:32:59,014
I just have to find Ariel
and get her back home.

474
00:32:59,047 --> 00:33:00,715
Now, uh,

475
00:33:00,749 --> 00:33:02,385
she was around
here somewhere.

476
00:33:02,418 --> 00:33:05,421
Uh-huh. Ah, yeah,
this must be it.

477
00:33:05,454 --> 00:33:07,323
I just have to be
firm with her,

478
00:33:07,356 --> 00:33:09,791
get her to see that
this is all just
a passing fad

479
00:33:09,824 --> 00:33:13,094
and in time, she'll forget
all about him.

480
00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:15,030
Ariel!

481
00:33:15,063 --> 00:33:16,765
Sebastian,
how did you find me?

482
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:18,568
What is all of this?

483
00:33:18,601 --> 00:33:20,303
What are you doin'
with that...

484
00:33:20,336 --> 00:33:21,870
that thing?

485
00:33:22,572 --> 00:33:24,039
Isn't it beautiful?

486
00:33:24,873 --> 00:33:26,609
Look at the longing
in his eyes.

487
00:33:26,642 --> 00:33:27,876
What you know
about longin'?

488
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:29,579
What is he doin' here?

489
00:33:29,612 --> 00:33:31,012
It's from the shipwreck.

490
00:33:31,046 --> 00:33:32,515
I found him
at Merman's Reef.

491
00:33:32,548 --> 00:33:34,115
And I'll bet
there's so much more.

492
00:33:34,149 --> 00:33:35,717
No, no! Ariel!

493
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,220
Child, get back here.

494
00:33:37,653 --> 00:33:39,355
Ariel!

495
00:33:39,388 --> 00:33:42,123
You have to let go
of this obsession
with humans.

496
00:33:42,157 --> 00:33:43,626
I'm not obsessed.

497
00:33:43,659 --> 00:33:45,294
I may be crusty,
but I'm not blind.

498
00:33:45,328 --> 00:33:48,096
I saw you the night
of the shipwreck.

499
00:33:48,129 --> 00:33:50,165
What?
Your father
wants you to stay

500
00:33:50,198 --> 00:33:52,668
as far away
from them
as possible!

501
00:33:52,702 --> 00:33:54,836
But why?
You know why.

502
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:57,707
We don't have to be afraid
of them, I know that now.

503
00:33:57,739 --> 00:34:00,243
Sebastian, if you had
just seen it up there.

504
00:34:00,276 --> 00:34:01,776
The ship rode on the wind,

505
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:03,713
and they filled
the sky with fire.

506
00:34:03,745 --> 00:34:05,847
Okay, okay.
Listen to me.

507
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,651

Somebody got to nail
that girl's fins to the floor.

581
00:38:27,676 --> 00:38:30,044
Oh, don't tell me
Eric is still going on

582
00:38:30,078 --> 00:38:32,013
about this girl
who rescued him.

583
00:38:32,046 --> 00:38:33,516
I'm afraid so.

584
00:38:33,549 --> 00:38:35,384
- And the shipwreck.
- Any casualties?

585
00:38:35,417 --> 00:38:37,253
None,
Your Majesty.

586
00:38:37,286 --> 00:38:38,921
Well, thank goodness
no lives were lost.

587
00:38:38,954 --> 00:38:40,723
Indeed.

588
00:38:40,756 --> 00:38:44,158
This restless
nature of his,
it concerns me.

589
00:38:44,192 --> 00:38:46,060
Undertaking these
dangerous voyages.

590
00:38:46,094 --> 00:38:47,963
Oh, Eric, sit.

591
00:38:47,997 --> 00:38:49,865
Any sign
of that girl yet,
Grimsby?

592
00:38:49,899 --> 00:38:51,767
Have some
breakfast, please.

593
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,067
Uh, we looked, sire.

594
00:38:53,101 --> 00:38:55,004
There was no girl.

595
00:38:55,036 --> 00:38:56,539
You were lucky
to have made it to shore

596
00:38:56,572 --> 00:38:57,473
before you passed out.

597
00:38:57,506 --> 00:38:59,040
She was real.
She saved my life.

598
00:38:59,073 --> 00:39:00,242
Sit down, Eric.

599
00:39:00,276 --> 00:39:02,043
I'm not hungry, Mother.
I'm worried about you.

600
00:39:02,076 --> 00:39:03,546
You've not been yourself
since the shipwreck.

601
00:39:03,579 --> 00:39:04,947
Have you checked
the neighboring islands?

602
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,448
Not all of them, but...
Then I will.

603
00:39:06,482 --> 00:39:07,683
No, you will not.

604
00:39:09,183 --> 00:39:11,353
You're not leaving this castle
until you're feeling better.

605
00:39:11,387 --> 00:39:13,489
I'll feel better
when I find her.

606
00:39:13,522 --> 00:39:14,657
Do not think
you're using

607
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:16,592
this girl as an excuse
to run off again,

608
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:18,561
risking your life
on some trade ship

609
00:39:18,594 --> 00:39:19,728
for the sheer adventure.

610
00:39:19,762 --> 00:39:21,463
"Sheer adventure"?

611
00:39:21,497 --> 00:39:23,131
I'm trying to reach out
to other cultures,

612
00:39:23,164 --> 00:39:24,500
so we don't
get left behind.

613
00:39:25,501 --> 00:39:26,635
Did you know
on this last trip

614
00:39:26,669 --> 00:39:29,238
we traded our cane
for 20 cases of quinine?

615
00:39:29,271 --> 00:39:30,940
They use it in Europe
to treat malaria.

616
00:39:30,973 --> 00:39:33,107
And where are
those 20 cases now?

617
00:39:33,141 --> 00:39:34,843
At the bottom of the sea.

618
00:39:34,877 --> 00:39:36,011
How many shipwrecks
have there been

619
00:39:36,045 --> 00:39:37,379
in our waters this year,
Prime Minister?

620
00:39:37,413 --> 00:39:39,915
Uh, six, Your Majesty.
Did you hear that, Eric?

621
00:39:39,949 --> 00:39:42,785
Of course, I did.
Shipwrecks, hurricanes,

622
00:39:42,818 --> 00:39:45,254
the sea gods
are against us.

623
00:39:45,287 --> 00:39:47,056
How many times
do I have to...

624
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:54,930
They are eroding
our land
from under us,

625
00:39:54,964 --> 00:39:56,632
stealing it back
into the ocean.

626
00:39:56,665 --> 00:39:58,199
They would kill us all
if they could.

627
00:39:58,233 --> 00:39:59,501
That's ridiculous.

628
00:39:59,535 --> 00:40:01,003
Is it?

629
00:40:01,036 --> 00:40:02,838
May I remind you,
that a deadly shipwreck

630
00:40:02,871 --> 00:40:04,373
first brought you to us.

631
00:40:04,406 --> 00:40:08,109
And now,
I almost lost you
to one the other day.

632
00:40:08,142 --> 00:40:09,979
We cannot keep
tempting fate like this.

633
00:40:10,012 --> 00:40:11,179
It has got to stop.

634
00:40:11,213 --> 00:40:12,982
Well, what does
that mean?

635
00:40:13,015 --> 00:40:14,717
It means that...

636
00:40:17,252 --> 00:40:20,055
that your responsibilities
are here now.

637
00:40:20,089 --> 00:40:22,224
So, no more voyages

638
00:40:22,257 --> 00:40:24,793

Oh. Yes, of course.

How do
we untangle this?

687
00:43:49,598 --> 00:43:51,466
Do these humans
have any idea

688
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,569
how much damage
their shipwrecks do?

689
00:43:53,602 --> 00:43:55,604
I don't think
they intended
to have a shipwreck.

690
00:43:55,637 --> 00:43:57,506
They are careless,
Ariel.

691
00:43:57,539 --> 00:43:59,174

thousands of years

692
00:43:59,209 --> 00:44:00,475
for this coral
to grow back.

693
00:44:00,509 --> 00:44:02,744
And they've killed
nearly all
of the sea fern.

694
00:44:02,778 --> 00:44:04,880
They'd kill us too,
if they had the chance.

695
00:44:04,913 --> 00:44:07,250
No, no.
They're not
all like that.

696
00:44:07,283 --> 00:44:09,319
Oh?
How would you know?

697
00:44:09,351 --> 00:44:11,186
You've never
even seen one.

698
00:44:11,221 --> 00:44:12,855
You were just a child

699
00:44:12,888 --> 00:44:16,358
and Father stopped us going
to the surface.

700
00:44:16,391 --> 00:44:18,460
I just mean,
we're not all the same,

701
00:44:18,493 --> 00:44:19,595
so why should humans be?

702
00:44:19,628 --> 00:44:21,597
What about humans?

703
00:44:22,298 --> 00:44:23,333
I... I just meant...

704
00:44:23,365 --> 00:44:25,033
Look at what
their shipwreck did.

705
00:44:26,568 --> 00:44:28,103
They got
what they deserved.

706
00:44:29,404 --> 00:44:32,474
They are the most
dangerous species of all.

707
00:44:32,507 --> 00:44:33,942
Spoiling our waters,

708
00:44:33,976 --> 00:44:36,312
destroying the reefs,

709
00:44:36,346 --> 00:44:39,748
having no respect
for the balance
of the oceans.

710
00:44:41,617 --> 00:44:42,684
They're not
the only ones

711
00:44:42,718 --> 00:44:44,686
who have no respect
for balance.

712
00:44:47,522 --> 00:44:50,158
Ariel,
where are you...

713
00:44:50,192 --> 00:44:52,295
What's going on with her?

714
00:44:52,328 --> 00:44:53,629
Oh, she's just
at that age

715
00:44:53,662 --> 00:44:54,997
when she doesn't want
to hang out

716
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:56,431
with her older sisters
anymore.

717
00:44:56,465 --> 00:44:58,767
Exactly. You remember
what I was like.

718
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,602
How could we forget?

719
00:45:00,636 --> 00:45:02,504
Well, I wonder
who the lucky merman is.

720
00:45:14,683 --> 00:45:17,853
The crab, Your Majesty.

721
00:45:18,921 --> 00:45:20,756
Come over here,
Sebastian.

722
00:45:23,659 --> 00:45:24,927
Breathe, Sebastian.

723
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,663
Remember,
guilty is as guilty acts.

724
00:45:27,696 --> 00:45:30,766
Don't overreact,
remain calm.

725
00:45:35,837 --> 00:45:37,273
Yes?

726
00:45:37,307 --> 00:45:39,741
Yes, Your Majesty?

727
00:45:39,775 --> 00:45:41,377
Sebastian,

728
00:45:41,411 --> 00:45:42,577
have you noticed

729
00:45:42,611 --> 00:45:45,447
that Ariel has been
acting peculiar lately?

730
00:45:46,249 --> 00:45:47,582
Peculiar, sir?

731
00:45:47,616 --> 00:45:50,452
Mm-hmm.
Distracted, daydreaming,

732
00:45:50,485 --> 00:45:52,187
disappearing for hours.

733
00:45:53,256 --> 00:45:55,023
You haven't noticed?

734
00:45:55,057 --> 00:45:57,826
Oh... Well, I, um...

735
00:45:58,894 --> 00:46:00,729
Uh...

736
00:46:00,762 --> 00:46:03,732
Uh, I actually haven't,
you know, um...

737
00:46:03,765 --> 00:46:05,834
that is to say,
I didn't, um...

738
00:46:08,438 --> 00:46:10,138
Sebastian...
Eh?

739
00:46:10,172 --> 00:46:13,209
I know you've been keeping
something from me.

740
00:46:13,242 --> 00:46:15,477
Keepin' somethin'?
Mm-hmm.

741
00:46:16,212 --> 00:46:17,646
About Ariel.

742
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:19,181
Ariel?

743
00:46:27,489 --> 00:46:29,992
Is my little one in love?

744
00:46:32,295 --> 00:46:33,762
Oh, I tried
to stop her, sir!

745
00:46:33,795 --> 00:46:35,431
I tried to stop her
from going to the surface!

746
00:46:35,465 --> 00:46:37,099
I told her to stay away
from humans!

747
00:46:37,132 --> 00:46:38,166
Humans?
When I saw her

748
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,335
with that statue, I...
Humans?

749
00:46:39,369 --> 00:46:41,069
Who said anything
about humans?

750
00:46:44,973 --> 00:46:47,009
Let's just drop
these things off and go back.

751
00:46:47,042 --> 00:46:48,110
No way!

752
00:46:48,143 --> 00:46:49,611
With all that great
stuff still down there?

753
00:46:49,644 --> 00:46:50,946
Don't we have
enough already?

754
00:46:50,979 --> 00:46:52,415
Come on, Flounder.

755
00:46:52,448 --> 00:46:53,515
We're just getting started.

756
00:46:53,548 --> 00:46:55,017
So...

757
00:46:56,685 --> 00:46:58,720
You broke the rules?

758
00:47:00,456 --> 00:47:03,292
You went
to the above world.

759
00:47:05,428 --> 00:47:06,928
There was a shipwreck.

760
00:47:07,963 --> 00:47:10,665
A man was drowning.
I had to save him.

761
00:47:10,699 --> 00:47:13,269
You should have
let him drown.

762
00:47:13,302 --> 00:47:14,970
They're savages.

763
00:47:15,003 --> 00:47:16,205
You don't know that.

764
00:47:17,539 --> 00:47:20,042
They killed your mother.

765
00:47:20,976 --> 00:47:21,977
I know.

766
00:47:23,212 --> 00:47:24,313
But...

767
00:47:24,347 --> 00:47:25,781
one man did.

768
00:47:25,814 --> 00:47:28,150
Why blame every human?

769
00:47:28,183 --> 00:47:29,452
Mother wouldn't.
No!

770
00:47:29,485 --> 00:47:31,521
Enough. That's enough.

771
00:47:31,553 --> 00:47:33,922
And Eric
had nothing
to do with it.

772
00:47:33,955 --> 00:47:35,190
Eric?

773
00:47:35,857 --> 00:47:37,092
Eric?

774
00:47:37,125 --> 00:47:39,429
Have you lost
your senses completely?

775
00:47:39,462 --> 00:47:41,596
If you would have
just heard him, Father.

776
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:44,434
He's compassionate
and kind and...

777
00:47:44,467 --> 00:47:45,734
He's a human!

778
00:47:45,767 --> 00:47:47,303
You're a mermaid!
Yes.

779
00:47:47,336 --> 00:47:48,837
But that doesn't
make us enemies.

780
00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:51,573
Promise me
you will never look
for him again.

781
00:47:51,606 --> 00:47:53,708
I can't.
Promise me, Ariel!

782
00:47:53,742 --> 00:47:55,744
I can't lie to you.
I won't.

783
00:47:55,777 --> 00:47:57,913
I swear,
I will get
through to you!

784
00:47:59,081 --> 00:48:00,182
No!

785
00:48:00,216 --> 00:48:01,350
Please!

786
00:48:02,351 --> 00:48:03,453
Father, stop.

787
00:48:03,486 --> 00:48:05,620
This ends now!

788
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:08,890
Please, stop it!

789
00:48:08,924 --> 00:48:10,625
It's for your own good.

790
00:48:13,396 --> 00:48:14,796
Father, no!

791
00:48:42,757 --> 00:48:45,228
Never leave again.

792
00:49:07,782 --> 00:49:08,984
Ariel.

793
00:49:10,051 --> 00:49:11,086
I'm...

794
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:12,654
Just go away.

795
00:49:30,606 --> 00:49:32,674
Poor child.

796
00:49:32,707 --> 00:49:34,943
Poor sweet child.

797
00:49:35,545 --> 00:49:38,747
He can be so angry.

798
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:41,116
He thinks
he knows everything.

799
00:49:42,751 --> 00:49:43,985
Who are you?

800
00:49:44,019 --> 00:49:47,256
Oh.
You must not remember me.

801
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:49,758
I'm your Auntie Ursula.

802
00:49:50,593 --> 00:49:51,760
The Sea Witch?

803
00:49:51,793 --> 00:49:54,230
The what?

804
00:49:54,263 --> 00:49:57,300
What has your father
told you about me?

805
00:49:58,099 --> 00:49:58,967
That...

806
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,936
That you like
to stir up trouble

807
00:50:00,969 --> 00:50:03,104
between humans
and merpeople.

808
00:50:03,138 --> 00:50:06,107
Oh.
Is that what he said?

809
00:50:06,141 --> 00:50:09,612
I'm not half the monster
he claims I am.

810
00:50:09,645 --> 00:50:11,947
And I'm only here to help.

811
00:50:12,847 --> 00:50:14,716
I don't need your help.

812
00:50:15,418 --> 00:50:17,152
Whatever you say, darling.

813
00:50:22,525 --> 00:50:24,227
Wait.
Yes?

814
00:50:27,697 --> 00:50:29,465
How can you help me?

815
00:50:38,341 --> 00:50:40,008
Ariel?

816
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:41,776
Where is she going

817
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:44,280
with those slippery
good-for-nothin's?

818
00:50:44,313 --> 00:50:45,414
Let's go.

819
00:52:10,232 --> 00:52:11,534
Come in.

820
00:52:11,567 --> 00:52:13,602
Come in, child.

821
00:52:13,636 --> 00:52:16,572
We mustn't lurk
in passageways.

822
00:52:16,605 --> 00:52:18,240
It's rude.

823
00:52:19,107 --> 00:52:21,876
Forgive my aggressive garden.

824
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:26,881
I wouldn't choose
to live like this,
believe me.

825
00:52:26,915 --> 00:52:29,385
Daddy's been so unfair
to both of us,

826
00:52:29,418 --> 00:52:33,222
controlling everything
we say and do.

827
00:52:34,155 --> 00:52:38,561
In a way,
we're the same,
you and I.

828
00:52:38,594 --> 00:52:42,264
You don't seem at all
like Father described you.

829
00:52:42,298 --> 00:52:43,998
Is that right?

830
00:52:44,032 --> 00:52:46,968
Mmm. We never did get along.

831
00:52:47,001 --> 00:52:49,037
Squidling rivalry.

832
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:52,341
He always got what he wanted,
and what did I get? Nothin'.

833
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:54,577
Zip, nada, squat.

834
00:52:55,778 --> 00:52:58,214
Sound familiar, hon?

835
00:52:58,247 --> 00:53:01,149
Oh, I know what you're
going through, believe me,

836
00:53:01,182 --> 00:53:04,185
and I know
why you're here.

837
00:53:04,787 --> 00:53:06,389
I'm not sure I do.

838
00:53:06,422 --> 00:53:08,357
Oh, please.

839
00:53:08,391 --> 00:53:12,294
I've been watching you
for a long time now, dearie.

840
00:53:12,328 --> 00:53:14,797
What you really want
is to be up there

841
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:16,766
in the above world.

842
00:53:16,799 --> 00:53:19,735
It's always
had your curiosity,

843
00:53:19,769 --> 00:53:22,838
and now
it's got your heart.

844
00:53:22,872 --> 00:53:24,373
What do you mean?

845
00:53:25,775 --> 00:53:27,410
You're so young.

846
00:53:28,511 --> 00:53:30,546
Don't you see?

847
00:53:30,579 --> 00:53:32,415
You're meant
for each other.

848
00:53:33,849 --> 00:53:37,686
And I can't bear
to see you
suffer like this.

849
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:40,689
As it happens,
I can help you.

850
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:42,591
How?

851
00:53:43,826 --> 00:53:47,095
Mmm, the problem
is simple.

852
00:53:47,128 --> 00:53:50,131
You can't live
in that world,
unless...

853
00:53:51,132 --> 00:53:54,068
you become
a human yourself.

854
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:56,137
Become human?

855
00:53:57,105 --> 00:53:58,574
Is that even possible?

856
00:53:58,607 --> 00:54:01,976
Oh, my dear.

857
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:03,945
It's what I do.

858
00:54:05,113 --> 00:54:06,816

Shh.

891
00:55:43,946 --> 00:55:45,648
So, here's the deal.

892
00:55:45,681 --> 00:55:46,916
I'll whip up
a little potion

893
00:55:46,949 --> 00:55:49,285
to make you human
for three days.

894
00:55:49,318 --> 00:55:50,419
Got that?

895
00:55:50,452 --> 00:55:52,254
Three days.

896
00:55:52,288 --> 00:55:54,557
Before the sun sets
on the third day,

897
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:56,926
you and Princey
must share a kiss.

898
00:55:56,959 --> 00:55:59,228
And not just any kiss.

899
00:55:59,261 --> 00:56:01,530
The kiss of true love.

900
00:56:03,332 --> 00:56:07,603
If you do,
you will remain
human permanently.

901
00:56:08,102 --> 00:56:10,239
But if you don't,

902
00:56:10,272 --> 00:56:13,842
you'll turn back
into a mermaid,

903
00:56:13,876 --> 00:56:16,912
and you belong to me.

904
00:56:16,946 --> 00:56:18,514
No, Ariel!
Shh.

905
00:56:19,448 --> 00:56:21,082
You understand,
of course,

906
00:56:21,115 --> 00:56:24,887
that you'll have
to give up
your mermaid gifts.

907
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,455
You won't have
this tail of yours,

908
00:56:26,488 --> 00:56:29,425
hangin' around,
draggin' you down.

909
00:56:29,458 --> 00:56:32,528
You won't be able
to breathe underwater,
who needs it?

910
00:56:34,563 --> 00:56:37,633
And you'll no longer have
that siren song of yours,

911
00:56:37,666 --> 00:56:41,270
because that
wouldn't be fair,
now would it?

912
00:56:41,804 --> 00:56:43,171
Don't worry.

913
00:56:43,205 --> 00:56:47,376
I'll keep it safe
and soundless here with me.

914
00:56:48,877 --> 00:56:50,346
We got a deal?

915
00:56:53,181 --> 00:56:54,650
I don't know.

916
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:56,485
Well...

917
00:56:56,518 --> 00:56:59,355

No.

921
00:57:10,933 --> 00:57:12,635
This is wrong.
I can't do this.

922
00:57:14,003 --> 00:57:17,072
Fine then,
forget about
the world above.

923
00:57:17,106 --> 00:57:19,608

Oh, Ariel.

00:59:32,208 --> 00:59:34,610
Well,
come on, gal.

952
00:59:34,643 --> 00:59:36,478
It's either sink
or swim.

00:59:47,289 --> 00:59:49,324
Don't worry, boys.

954
00:59:49,358 --> 00:59:53,229
She doesn't stand
a chance without this.

955
00:59:53,263 --> 00:59:55,864
A mermaid
without her voice?

956
00:59:58,268 --> 00:59:59,735
And just in case,

957
00:59:59,768 --> 01:00:04,373
I slipped a little somethin'
extra into that spell of mine.

01:00:04,406 --> 01:00:07,509
No matter how hard
that girl tries,

959
01:00:07,543 --> 01:00:11,713
she won't remember
she needs to get that kiss.

960
01:00:11,747 --> 01:00:14,349
Now it's just
a matter of time.

961
01:00:16,018 --> 01:00:17,452
And then she's mine.

962
01:00:17,486 --> 01:00:20,055
Hmm.

963
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:27,830
Not so easy
without your tail, is it?

964
01:00:29,299 --> 01:00:30,399
Keep going.

965
01:00:30,432 --> 01:00:32,100
You just got
to get your sea legs.

966
01:00:33,202 --> 01:00:35,103
We're almost there.

967
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:44,913
Get away from here!

968
01:00:46,348 --> 01:00:48,083

970
01:00:54,923 --> 01:00:56,491
Ah, poor girl.

971
01:00:56,525 --> 01:00:57,893
You must be in shock.

972
01:00:59,229 --> 01:01:00,996
I'll go find something
to cover you up.

973
01:01:01,864 --> 01:01:03,465
Another shipwreck.

974
01:01:03,498 --> 01:01:05,834
<i>Santa Maria.</i>

975
01:01:26,054 --> 01:01:27,689
Say, what's goin' on, kid?

976
01:01:27,723 --> 01:01:29,259
I thought
you weren't supposed
to be up here,

977
01:01:29,292 --> 01:01:30,492
now you're taking
boat rides?

978
01:01:30,525 --> 01:01:32,160
That... That...
That rotten Sea Witch,

979
01:01:32,194 --> 01:01:33,296
she stole Ariel's voice.

980
01:01:33,329 --> 01:01:34,630
Hey, Flounder.

981
01:01:34,663 --> 01:01:35,998
What... What are you
talkin' about?

982
01:01:36,031 --> 01:01:38,433
So, Sebastian told Triton
that Ariel saved a human

983
01:01:38,467 --> 01:01:39,701
and Triton got so mad.
Okay, okay, okay.

984
01:01:39,735 --> 01:01:41,436
And then... Wait!
Explanations later, man.

985
01:01:41,470 --> 01:01:42,638
We've gotta get you
out of here.

986
01:01:42,671 --> 01:01:44,106
Wait! I didn't tell you
about the Sea Witch!

987
01:01:44,139 --> 01:01:47,843
Bye-bye.
And don't tell anyone
about the Sea Witch!

988
01:01:47,876 --> 01:01:51,780
Something about you
seems different.

989
01:01:51,813 --> 01:01:53,015
Don't tell me.

990
01:01:53,048 --> 01:01:54,917
It's your hairdo, right?

991
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:57,353
'Cause you've been using
the dinglehopper? No?

992
01:01:57,387 --> 01:02:01,056
I can't... I can't
quite figure it out,

993
01:02:01,089 --> 01:02:03,592
but I know that if I stand
here for long enough...

994
01:02:03,625 --> 01:02:06,161
She got legs,
ya idiot!

995
01:02:06,194 --> 01:02:07,663
You know,
we've discussed this.

996
01:02:07,696 --> 01:02:09,498
I don't like it
when you call me an idiot.

997
01:02:09,531 --> 01:02:10,899
Why don't you tell me
somethin' nice?

998
01:02:10,933 --> 01:02:11,800
"Hey, Scuttle.

999
01:02:11,833 --> 01:02:13,168
- "Your feathers look good."
- Shoo!

1000
01:02:13,201 --> 01:02:15,470
Here you are.

1001
01:02:15,504 --> 01:02:17,472
It'll have to do
for now.

1002
01:02:17,506 --> 01:02:19,342
I'll take you

1003

They'll know what
to do with you there.

1004
01:02:21,643 --> 01:02:23,379
Come on, in ya go.

1005
01:02:30,619 --> 01:02:32,754
- Good catch today.
- It looks good, though.

1006
01:02:32,788 --> 01:02:34,489
It looks raw.

1007
01:02:36,326 --> 01:02:37,427
You're not done yet?

1008
01:02:37,459 --> 01:02:39,362

1009
01:02:39,395 --> 01:02:40,829

Oh, no, you poor girl.

1062
01:04:59,801 --> 01:05:01,636

1089
01:06:32,694 --> 01:06:34,297
She doesn't

01:06:38,934 --> 01:06:39,935

Well, then you're welcome

the single
most humiliating
day of my life!

1114
01:08:14,062 --> 01:08:15,797

1115
01:08:15,830 --> 01:08:19,834
and then, having to climb
all the way up here.

1116
01:08:19,868 --> 01:08:22,037
They couldn't
give you a room
on the ground floor?

1117
01:08:23,905 --> 01:08:25,574
I hope you appreciate

1118
01:08:25,608 --> 01:08:28,344
what I go through

01:08:28,377 --> 01:08:29,445
Eh, no.

Don't ya turn
your back on me.

1121
01:08:31,347 --> 01:08:32,315
What were you thinkin',

1122
01:08:32,348 --> 01:08:35,451
choosin' to give up
your mermaid gifts?

1123
01:08:35,484 --> 01:08:38,354
Now, if we could
just get that witch
to give them back,

1124
01:08:38,387 --> 01:08:41,122
then you could
go home
and just be...

1125
01:08:41,156 --> 01:08:43,058
uh, well,
and just be...

1126
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:49,398
just be miserable
for the rest of your life.

1127
01:08:49,432 --> 01:08:52,468
Oh, my, what a soft shell
I am turnin' out to be.

1128
01:08:53,469 --> 01:08:55,771
All right.
All right.

1129
01:08:55,805 --> 01:08:57,473
I'll try to help you.

1130
01:08:57,506 --> 01:08:59,775
But we've got
to be bold,
act quickly.

1131
01:08:59,809 --> 01:09:01,544
Don't forget
about the kiss.

1132
01:09:02,611 --> 01:09:04,213
Ah, no, no, not me,
the Prince!

1133
01:09:04,246 --> 01:09:05,748
You gotta kiss
the Prince.

1134
01:09:05,781 --> 01:09:06,848
Don't you remember?

1135
01:09:06,881 --> 01:09:08,517
You only have
three days to...

1136
01:09:09,518 --> 01:09:11,019
Hello?

1137
01:09:11,687 --> 01:09:13,356
Oh, no!

1138
01:09:13,389 --> 01:09:15,624
She's put
a spell on you.

1139
01:09:15,658 --> 01:09:17,727
You can't remember,
can you?

1140
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:19,628
Now,
what are we gonna do?

1141
01:09:20,596 --> 01:09:22,465
Well, we got
no time to lose.

1142
01:09:22,498 --> 01:09:23,998
We just got
to find a way

1143
01:09:24,032 --> 01:09:26,034
to get the two
of you together.

1144
01:09:29,772 --> 01:09:32,508
You are hopeless, child.

1145
01:09:32,541 --> 01:09:33,542
You know that?

1146
01:09:34,976 --> 01:09:36,612
Completely hopeless.

1147
01:09:45,788 --> 01:09:48,156
Ooh. A buffet.

1148
01:09:50,493 --> 01:09:52,428
What? No nuts?

1149
01:09:52,461 --> 01:09:53,496
What are you
doin' here?

1150
01:09:53,529 --> 01:09:56,097
Oh, there you are.
I've been lookin' for you.

1151
01:09:56,131 --> 01:09:58,032
Flounder told me
the whole story.

1152
01:09:58,066 --> 01:09:59,802
Has Ariel killed
the Prince yet?

1153
01:09:59,835 --> 01:10:01,570
No, not "killed."

1154
01:10:01,604 --> 01:10:03,138
"Kissed," ya bird brain.

1155
01:10:03,171 --> 01:10:04,807
And it's worse
than we thought.

1156
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,308
The witch has placed
a spell on her.

1157
01:10:06,342 --> 01:10:08,210
Soon as I tell her
she's got to kiss him,

1158
01:10:08,244 --> 01:10:10,746
the thought jumps clear
right out of her head.

1159
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:11,913
So, now it's up to us.

1160
01:10:11,946 --> 01:10:13,416
To kiss the Prince?

1161
01:10:13,449 --> 01:10:14,784
Forget it.

1162
01:10:14,817 --> 01:10:16,218
Where's Ariel now?

1163
01:10:16,252 --> 01:10:17,986
What do ya mean?
She's right...

1164
01:10:20,556 --> 01:10:21,891
Oh.

1165
01:12:23,111 --> 01:12:25,247
What are you doin'
in here, child?

1166
01:12:25,281 --> 01:12:28,284
You can't just go wanderin'
around wherever you please.

1167
01:12:28,317 --> 01:12:30,386
- Hide!
- Who's in here?

1168
01:12:38,961 --> 01:12:40,194
Oh, it's you.

1169
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,736
Nobody usually
comes in here.

1170
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:53,475
My little mermaid.

1171
01:12:54,843 --> 01:12:56,879
It's all right,
it's all right.

1172
01:12:56,912 --> 01:12:58,347
You can look at it.

1173
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:00,683
I found her
on the coast
of Cartagena.

1174
01:13:01,850 --> 01:13:03,184
Isn't she beautiful?

1175
01:13:06,187 --> 01:13:07,723
Oh, that's right. You...

1176
01:13:10,526 --> 01:13:12,728
Well, it really
doesn't matter.

1177
01:13:12,761 --> 01:13:14,663
Most people around here
use too many words

1178
01:13:14,697 --> 01:13:15,764
and have nothing to say.

1179
01:13:17,533 --> 01:13:19,133
You know,

1180
01:13:19,167 --> 01:13:20,603
I never believed
all that lore

1181
01:13:20,636 --> 01:13:24,239
about mermaids luring
sailors to their deaths.

1182
01:13:26,609 --> 01:13:28,142
Here, take her.

1183
01:13:29,445 --> 01:13:31,280
No, really.
I want you to have her.

1184
01:13:32,314 --> 01:13:34,182
I'm running
out of space
as it is.

1185
01:13:35,250 --> 01:13:38,387
Nearly all of these things
come from my voyages.

1186
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:41,155
I know it must seem silly,
collecting all this stuff,

1187
01:13:41,189 --> 01:13:44,326
but just look
at this fossilized
sea stone.

1188
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:46,061
Can you believe
that such amazing things

1189
01:13:46,095 --> 01:13:47,296
exist down there?

1190
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,200
No, wait!

1191
01:14:00,242 --> 01:14:01,844
How did you know
that was in there...

1192
01:14:03,879 --> 01:14:04,880
all this time?

1193
01:14:07,282 --> 01:14:08,517
That's incredible.

1194
01:14:10,219 --> 01:14:11,654
- Well, that.
- Hey, girl.

1195
01:14:11,687 --> 01:14:14,723
That I just picked up
from the beach
here on the island.

1196
01:14:14,757 --> 01:14:17,359
There's loads of them
at this time of year.

1197
01:14:24,533 --> 01:14:26,568
I had no idea
you could do that.

1198
01:14:28,537 --> 01:14:29,672
Oh, me?

1199
01:14:30,472 --> 01:14:31,473
No... Oh.

1200
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:33,042
Really?

1201
01:14:33,075 --> 01:14:34,476
All right, hand...

1202
01:14:35,778 --> 01:14:36,812
How do I...

1203
01:14:37,946 --> 01:14:39,581
Yeah, that's it.

1204
01:14:39,615 --> 01:14:40,849
That's it, girl.

1205
01:14:40,883 --> 01:14:42,484
Go get it,
go get it.

1206
01:14:42,518 --> 01:14:43,352
I see ya.

1207
01:14:43,385 --> 01:14:45,654
Go on, come now...

1208
01:14:49,190 --> 01:14:51,660
Sorry.

1209
01:14:52,094 --> 01:14:53,295
Yeah, well...

1210
01:14:54,797 --> 01:14:55,798
I'll work on that.

1211
01:14:57,332 --> 01:14:58,467
I love the people there.

1212
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:01,136
Their culture,
their custom.

1213
01:15:01,170 --> 01:15:04,306
This whole region is known
as the Brazilian Empire.

1214
01:15:04,339 --> 01:15:06,775
Then there's Venezuela,

1215
01:15:07,643 --> 01:15:10,345
uh, Colombia...

1216
01:15:10,379 --> 01:15:13,348
Oh, the area up here
is called Mosquito Coast.

1217
01:15:16,285 --> 01:15:18,387
Those waters
are all uncharted.

1218
01:15:19,555 --> 01:15:21,457
Wouldn't it be amazing
to discover someplace

1219
01:15:21,490 --> 01:15:23,225
no one's ever seen before?

1220
01:15:27,629 --> 01:15:29,264
Ah. Well, this...

1221
01:15:29,298 --> 01:15:31,600
this was one
of my favorite voyages.

1222
01:15:32,401 --> 01:15:33,936
I bought
that Peruvian rug there,

1223
01:15:33,969 --> 01:15:36,572
along with six of the looms
they used to make it.

1224
01:15:36,605 --> 01:15:37,639
Oh.

1225
01:15:37,673 --> 01:15:39,541
Another one.
All right.

1226
01:15:40,943 --> 01:15:44,613
Ah. This is our island.

1227
01:15:44,646 --> 01:15:47,249
We're in that very castle
right now.

1228
01:15:47,282 --> 01:15:49,618
Over here's
our main village.

1229
01:15:49,651 --> 01:15:52,721
Now, our port there
was once the busiest
in the region.

1230
01:15:54,224 --> 01:15:55,958
I'm hoping
it will be again
one day.

1231
01:15:57,926 --> 01:15:59,261
And there's a beautiful lagoon

1232
01:15:59,294 --> 01:16:01,263
with a little waterfall
right here.

1233
01:16:01,296 --> 01:16:03,932
And then all of that
is rainforest.

1234
01:16:05,167 --> 01:16:07,903
I could show you around,
if you like.

1235
01:16:09,271 --> 01:16:10,839
All right.

1236
01:16:10,873 --> 01:16:12,975
- We'll go tomorrow.
- But, sire...

1237
01:16:13,008 --> 01:16:14,710
Oh, Grimsby, good.

1238
01:16:14,743 --> 01:16:16,111
We'll need a horse
and carriage

1239
01:16:16,145 --> 01:16:17,613
ready for us
in the morning.

1240
01:16:17,646 --> 01:16:20,048
May I have
a quiet word, sire?

1241
01:16:21,950 --> 01:16:22,951
Of course.

1242
01:16:25,687 --> 01:16:27,890
He's a special one,
isn't he?

1243
01:16:27,923 --> 01:16:29,525
And that moonlight. Ah...

1244
01:16:32,661 --> 01:16:35,464
We were going to send out
all the carriages tomorrow

1245
01:16:35,497 --> 01:16:36,632
to look for the girl.

1246
01:16:36,665 --> 01:16:38,767
The girl!
I wasn't thinking.

1247
01:16:38,801 --> 01:16:41,303
Of course, yes,
we must do that. Absolutely.

1248
01:16:41,336 --> 01:16:43,273
And I must
remind you, Eric,

1249
01:16:43,305 --> 01:16:44,406
what your mother
said yesterday

1250
01:16:44,439 --> 01:16:46,008
about you not leaving
the castle

1251
01:16:46,041 --> 01:16:48,644
until you're
feeling better.
Grimsby, I feel fine.

1252
01:16:48,677 --> 01:16:50,646
I feel better
than ever.

1253
01:16:51,513 --> 01:16:52,514
Yes.

1254
01:16:53,749 --> 01:16:54,950
Yes, I can see that.

1255
01:16:56,552 --> 01:17:00,522
I suppose
we could spare
one carriage.

1256
01:17:24,012 --> 01:17:26,682
Looks like you made
a friend there.

1257
01:17:26,715 --> 01:17:28,116
Come on, Max.

1258
01:17:28,150 --> 01:17:29,418
We'll see you later.

1259
01:17:29,451 --> 01:17:31,420
Oh, no.
You're not goin'
without me.

1260
01:17:31,453 --> 01:17:33,223
I only got
two days left.

1261
01:17:33,256 --> 01:17:34,423
I'm a crab
on a mission.

1262
01:17:34,456 --> 01:17:36,458
Trot on, King.

1263
01:17:40,963 --> 01:17:43,266
I'm getting
too old for this.

1264
01:17:43,299 --> 01:17:45,167
Oh, no, no, no!
Down, beast!

1265
01:17:46,902 --> 01:17:47,936
Whoa!

1266
01:17:50,005 --> 01:17:51,840
I still got it.

1267
01:17:55,978 --> 01:17:58,647
Who is that ridin' out
with Prince Eric?

1268
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:00,816
Is that the girl
who washed up
the other day?

1269
01:18:00,849 --> 01:18:03,286
Yes, it is, Lashana.

1270
01:18:03,319 --> 01:18:05,621
Didn't the Queen tell him
to stay in the castle?

1271
01:18:05,654 --> 01:18:07,223
Yes, she did, Lashana.

1272
01:18:07,257 --> 01:18:08,690
Aren't you going
to get into trouble

1273
01:18:08,724 --> 01:18:10,326
for fetching him
a carriage?

1274
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:11,960
What carriage, Lashana?

1275
01:18:36,118 --> 01:18:37,419
Oh.

1276
01:18:37,452 --> 01:18:38,654
Do you wanna try?

1277
01:18:40,155 --> 01:18:41,156
Here.

1278
01:18:42,392 --> 01:18:43,592
Oh!

1279
01:18:48,096 --> 01:18:50,532
Um...

1280
01:18:54,169 --> 01:18:55,637
Look out! Look out!

1281
01:18:56,306 --> 01:18:57,973
Come on!
Move, move, move!

1282
01:19:01,543 --> 01:19:04,579
Sorry about that!

1283
01:19:06,548 --> 01:19:08,150
That was close.

1284
01:19:08,183 --> 01:19:09,285
Whoa!

1285
01:19:09,319 --> 01:19:10,886
Hey, guys!
Get out the way!

1286
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:13,256
- Turn!
- Quickly!

1287
01:19:13,289 --> 01:19:14,489
Wait, wait, wait!

1288
01:19:15,425 --> 01:19:16,625
Careful!

1289
01:19:30,138 --> 01:19:31,573
Oh!

1290
01:19:32,074 --> 01:19:33,276
That was...

1291
01:19:33,309 --> 01:19:34,576
fun.

1292
01:19:34,609 --> 01:19:35,911
Here, I'll...

1293
01:19:38,381 --> 01:19:39,581
Let me give you a hand.

1294
01:19:40,148 --> 01:19:41,217
Move, move 'em.

1295
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:42,385
Here we go.
This way.

1296
01:19:42,418 --> 01:19:44,519
Come on.
This way.

1297
01:19:44,553 --> 01:19:47,022
Here we go.

1298
01:19:47,055 --> 01:19:48,090
Go on. That's it.

1299
01:19:49,325 --> 01:19:50,426
Thank you, lad.

1300
01:20:09,945 --> 01:20:11,247
Island berry?

1301
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,948
How is it? Pretty?

1302
01:20:14,283 --> 01:20:15,617
- Whoa!
- Coconut!

1303
01:20:15,650 --> 01:20:17,253
- Breadfruit!
- Coconut!

1304
01:20:19,455 --> 01:20:20,655
Fresh coconut?

1305
01:20:22,124 --> 01:20:23,759
No? You don't want it?

1306
01:20:23,792 --> 01:20:25,794
Get some water in ya.

1307
01:20:27,729 --> 01:20:29,265
- Thank you, Miss.
- Young lady,

1308
01:20:29,298 --> 01:20:30,866
would you like
to try some?

1309
01:20:33,503 --> 01:20:34,536
Oh!

1310
01:20:34,569 --> 01:20:36,638
I think you'll be
needing this.

1311
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:53,989
Hey,
can I have some salt?

1312
01:20:54,756 --> 01:20:56,591
Good day, sire.

1313
01:20:57,293 --> 01:20:59,127
How ripe the mango?

1314
01:20:59,161 --> 01:21:00,562
Hat for the lady?

1315
01:21:02,931 --> 01:21:04,800
Oh.
There you are.

1316
01:21:06,568 --> 01:21:09,405
Oh.
No, no. Too big.

1317
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:10,639
Try this.

1318
01:21:16,845 --> 01:21:18,647
Tropical flowers?

1319
01:21:56,586 --> 01:21:58,620
Hey!
Everybody, everybody!

1320
01:21:58,653 --> 01:22:00,223
Hey, hey, hey!

1321
01:22:00,256 --> 01:22:01,390
Hey!

1322
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:07,729
Say, any kissing yet?

1323
01:22:07,762 --> 01:22:09,831
No. When it comes
to romance,

1324
01:22:09,865 --> 01:22:11,700
these two
are slow as snails.

1325
01:22:11,733 --> 01:22:13,168
Hey, go find Flounder.

1326
01:22:13,201 --> 01:22:15,637
We got to move
this thing along,
and quick.

1327
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:17,306
Okay, bossy.

1328
01:22:20,976 --> 01:22:23,246
Hey!

1329
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:24,413
Hey!

1330
01:22:26,582 --> 01:22:28,484
Bring it here,
bring it here,
bring it here now!

1331
01:22:28,518 --> 01:22:30,253
Back it up,
back it up,
back it up!

1332
01:22:35,324 --> 01:22:36,559
Come on, now!

1333
01:22:52,974 --> 01:22:54,743
I love this
time of night.

1334
01:22:55,944 --> 01:22:58,847
Sometimes you'll see
the eyes of a screech owl,

1335
01:22:58,880 --> 01:22:59,915
up in the tree...

1336
01:22:59,948 --> 01:23:01,551
Hey! Hey!

1337
01:23:01,584 --> 01:23:03,051
Hey, come back
with that!

1338
01:23:03,586 --> 01:23:04,786
Come on.

1339
01:23:06,255 --> 01:23:07,356
Watch out.

1340
01:23:08,291 --> 01:23:09,492
I think
it went this way.

1341
01:23:09,525 --> 01:23:11,760
You all right?
Hey!

1342
01:23:12,528 --> 01:23:13,995
Give me my hat back!

1343
01:23:19,734 --> 01:23:22,572
Oh. All right then.

1344
01:23:25,707 --> 01:23:27,842
I didn't want
to lose this.

1345
01:23:43,326 --> 01:23:45,561
Move your big
fat feathers, bird.

1346
01:23:45,595 --> 01:23:46,761
I can't see a thing.

1347
01:23:46,795 --> 01:23:47,963
Well, that worked
pretty good,
didn't it?

1348
01:23:47,996 --> 01:23:49,298
But nothing's happening.

1349
01:23:49,332 --> 01:23:51,866
We're running out of time,
and no one's puckered up once.

1350
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:53,935
I think it's time
for a little

1351
01:23:53,969 --> 01:23:56,539
vocal romantic
stimulation.

1352
01:23:58,006 --> 01:23:59,375
Please, no.

1353
01:23:59,408 --> 01:24:00,976
Scuttle?

Nah, man.
We got to be
sneaky about this.

1368
01:24:24,065 --> 01:24:25,900

How are we gonna do that?

1372
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,975
We got to blend in

1373
01:24:34,009 --> 01:24:35,511
so she doesn't hear us.

01:26:12,608 --> 01:26:13,642
You can see Orion.

1404
01:26:15,378 --> 01:26:18,947
Oh, the... The sailors
use the constellations
to navigate.

1405
01:26:20,181 --> 01:26:22,251
That one's Orion,
the hunter.

1406
01:26:24,453 --> 01:26:27,088
There's Aries,
the ram.

1407
01:26:28,923 --> 01:26:30,526
That's Cassiopeia.

1408
01:26:31,761 --> 01:26:33,061
That's funny.

1409
01:26:33,094 --> 01:26:35,264
I still don't know
your name.

1410
01:26:36,866 --> 01:26:39,568
Let's see.
Is it...

1411
01:26:40,436 --> 01:26:41,570
Diana?

1412
01:26:42,772 --> 01:26:43,972
No?

1413
01:26:45,173 --> 01:26:46,409
Or...

1414
01:26:47,343 --> 01:26:49,345
Katherine?

1415
01:26:49,378 --> 01:26:52,147
No, definitely
not Katherine.

1416
01:26:53,549 --> 01:26:55,016
How...

1417
01:26:58,487 --> 01:27:00,188
Sky...

1418
01:27:00,222 --> 01:27:01,323
Uh...

1419
01:27:05,428 --> 01:27:06,429
Aries?

1420
01:27:07,463 --> 01:27:08,464
Aries.

1421
01:27:09,532 --> 01:27:10,533
Arie...

1422
01:27:11,901 --> 01:27:13,101
Ari-el.

1423
01:27:14,637 --> 01:27:15,671
Ariel?

1424
01:27:16,806 --> 01:27:18,607
Ari-el?

1425
01:27:20,376 --> 01:27:21,544
Ariel.

1426
01:27:24,447 --> 01:27:26,014
That's a beautiful name.

1427
01:27:30,853 --> 01:27:32,288
Written in the stars.

What...
What was that?

1463
01:29:04,613 --> 01:29:06,515
That was close.

1464
01:29:06,549 --> 01:29:07,750
Too close.

1465
01:29:09,552 --> 01:29:10,819
I don't get it.

1466
01:29:10,853 --> 01:29:13,389
I didn't think that little
barracuda stood a chance

1467
01:29:13,422 --> 01:29:16,625
luring him in
without her voice.

1468
01:29:16,659 --> 01:29:18,727
How's that
even possible?

1469
01:29:18,761 --> 01:29:22,163
Well, we're not gonna
let that happen again.

1470
01:29:22,196 --> 01:29:26,001
It's time Ursula
took matters
into her own tentacles.

1471
01:29:26,035 --> 01:29:27,570
Where is it?

1472
01:29:27,603 --> 01:29:31,040
Come on, come on.
It's gotta be
here somewhere.

1473
01:29:31,072 --> 01:29:34,743
No! No!

1474
01:29:34,777 --> 01:29:37,111
Nobody ever puts
my things back!

1475
01:29:39,481 --> 01:29:41,383
No! Where is it?

1476
01:29:49,024 --> 01:29:52,595
No, no, no!

1477
01:29:52,628 --> 01:29:56,031
No!

1478
01:29:56,065 --> 01:29:57,700
Oh, there it is.

1479
01:29:57,733 --> 01:29:59,602
I got it.

1480
01:29:59,635 --> 01:30:03,204
That Prince won't know
what hit him.

1481
01:30:03,772 --> 01:30:06,909
Only one more sunset

1482
01:30:06,942 --> 01:30:09,411
and then I'll make
Triton writhe.

1483
01:30:11,145 --> 01:30:15,050
I'll see him wriggle
like a worm on a hook.

1484
01:30:24,125 --> 01:30:25,394
So where is she?

1485
01:30:25,427 --> 01:30:27,062
- We don't know, Father.
- She's gone.

1486
01:30:27,096 --> 01:30:28,397
What do you mean,
she's gone?

1487
01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:29,932
We've been
looking and looking.

1488
01:30:29,965 --> 01:30:31,132
There's no sign
of her anywhere.

1489
01:30:31,165 --> 01:30:33,302
She's not
in these waters.
Then look again.

1490
01:30:33,335 --> 01:30:35,638
Search all
of the Seven Seas
if you have to.

1491
01:30:37,439 --> 01:30:38,607
Ariel wouldn't dare
go above again.

1492
01:30:38,641 --> 01:30:41,010
Don't even think
such a thing.

1493
01:30:41,043 --> 01:30:43,177
Doesn't make sense.
Why would she leave?

1494
01:30:43,212 --> 01:30:44,980
I...
I have no idea.

1495
01:30:45,014 --> 01:30:47,116
Never mind that.
Just find her.

1496
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,808
What have I done?

1497
01:31:25,521 --> 01:31:26,955
Everyone's asleep.

1498
01:31:26,989 --> 01:31:29,224
We should
probably be quiet.
In his room,

1499
01:31:29,258 --> 01:31:30,392
- all day?
- Wait.

1500
01:31:30,426 --> 01:31:31,460
Go. Oh, no.
I haven't seen him once.

1501
01:31:31,493 --> 01:31:33,062
Go, go.
Go in there.
Go. Careful.

1502
01:31:33,095 --> 01:31:34,430
I imagine
he's just resting.

1503
01:31:34,463 --> 01:31:35,898
Has he been
avoiding me?

1504
01:31:35,931 --> 01:31:36,999
No, Your Majesty.

1505
01:31:37,032 --> 01:31:38,067
No?
No.

1506
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:39,435
No?
No.

1507
01:31:39,468 --> 01:31:41,136
You seem
awfully certain.

1508
01:31:41,170 --> 01:31:42,203
Avoiding you?

1509
01:31:42,237 --> 01:31:43,405
Doesn't seem like Eric,
does it?

1510
01:31:43,439 --> 01:31:44,807
Then where is he?

1511
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:47,776
Oh, he's not searching
for that fantasy girl,
I hope.

1512
01:31:49,278 --> 01:31:50,412
No,
Your Majesty.

1513
01:31:50,446 --> 01:31:52,281
That I can say
with certainty.

1514
01:31:52,314 --> 01:31:54,249
Thank heavens
for small blessings.

1515
01:31:54,283 --> 01:31:55,517
Oh!

1516
01:31:55,551 --> 01:31:57,219
It's wet.

1517
01:31:57,986 --> 01:31:59,088
I will look
into it.

1518
01:31:59,121 --> 01:32:01,390
You really must get
some rest yourself.

1519
01:32:01,423 --> 01:32:03,158
Yes,
I suppose I should.

1520
01:32:03,192 --> 01:32:05,027
Thank you, Grimsby.
Good night.

1521
01:32:05,060 --> 01:32:06,261
Ma'am.

1522
01:32:06,295 --> 01:32:08,130
Sorry about that.

1523
01:32:08,163 --> 01:32:11,033
I wasn't supposed
to leave the castle today.

1524
01:32:11,066 --> 01:32:12,468
But I'm glad I did.

1525
01:32:14,737 --> 01:32:15,938
All these rules...

1526
01:32:17,473 --> 01:32:20,576
The truth is,
I wasn't born
to all this,

1527
01:32:20,609 --> 01:32:22,144
and it all
makes me feel
a little uneasy...

1528
01:32:22,177 --> 01:32:24,346
Welcome back, sire.
Oh, Grimsby.

1529
01:32:24,379 --> 01:32:25,781
Uh...

1530
01:32:25,814 --> 01:32:26,815
Uh...

1531
01:32:26,849 --> 01:32:29,785
I trust you two had
a pleasant outing.

1532
01:32:29,818 --> 01:32:31,221
Uh, yes, we did.
Didn't we?

1533
01:32:31,253 --> 01:32:33,088
Yes.
Very nice.

1534
01:32:33,122 --> 01:32:34,523
You've had
a long day, Miss.

1535
01:32:34,556 --> 01:32:37,159
I imagine we should
let you get some sleep.

1536
01:32:37,192 --> 01:32:39,595
And perhaps
dried off as well.

1537
01:32:39,628 --> 01:32:40,629
Oh, uh... Yes.

1538
01:32:40,662 --> 01:32:42,965
We... We took
a rowboat out
onto the lagoon,

1539
01:32:42,998 --> 01:32:44,566
and I'm afraid
we ended up in it.

1540
01:32:45,868 --> 01:32:47,803
Anyway,
good night.

1541
01:32:50,806 --> 01:32:51,807
Oh.

1542
01:32:57,247 --> 01:32:58,447
Good night...

1543
01:32:59,581 --> 01:33:00,783
Ariel.

1544
01:33:07,523 --> 01:33:09,691
About the carriages, sire,

1545
01:33:10,192 --> 01:33:11,660
I'm afraid they, uh,

1546
01:33:12,528 --> 01:33:14,663
didn't find
the mystery girl.

1547
01:33:15,697 --> 01:33:16,698
They didn't?

1548
01:33:19,034 --> 01:33:20,435
Oh.

1549
01:33:21,237 --> 01:33:23,138
May I then ask,

1550
01:33:23,172 --> 01:33:25,407
should we continue
the search?

1551
01:33:27,843 --> 01:33:29,011
Grimsby, um...

1552
01:33:30,045 --> 01:33:31,413
I just...

1553
01:33:32,215 --> 01:33:33,882
I feel a little...

1554
01:33:35,317 --> 01:33:38,754
Well, if you
want the advice
of an old man, sire,

1555
01:33:39,755 --> 01:33:42,724
don't be held back
by what you think
should be.

1556
01:33:43,392 --> 01:33:45,427
Think only of what is.

1557
01:33:46,795 --> 01:33:47,796
Good night, sire.

1558
01:36:16,778 --> 01:36:19,047
Hey! Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!

1559
01:36:19,081 --> 01:36:20,283

I was mistaken.

your intended to the court.

can't we, Grimsby?

01:38:55,670 --> 01:38:56,738
Yes.

what you want, Eric.

Mm-hmm. Indeed.

1652
01:39:12,555 --> 01:39:15,657
Then let's
begin preparations.
Grimsby...

1653
01:39:18,994 --> 01:39:20,829
Oh, Ariel, girl.

1654
01:39:20,862 --> 01:39:22,265
Where have you gone?

1655
01:39:23,533 --> 01:39:25,434
Yeah.
Any sign of her?
No luck.

1656
01:39:25,468 --> 01:39:27,370
I flew over the village
three times.

1657
01:39:27,403 --> 01:39:28,837
Well, check
the castle again!

1658

We got to find her.

01:39:32,140 --> 01:39:33,875

going on here.
I don't like

1662

You can't give up

1685
01:41:59,854 --> 01:42:02,991
This all has to be
some sort
of misunderstanding.

1686

I watched
both of you.

1687

1697
01:42:21,277 --> 01:42:24,045
No!
The Prince
has been tricked.

1698
01:42:24,079 --> 01:42:25,781
That lady
who showed up

1699
01:42:25,815 --> 01:42:28,116
is actually
the Sea Witch
in disguise.

1700

Well, what are we
gonna do?

1705
01:42:35,890 --> 01:42:37,058
Well, we have
to do something

1706
01:42:37,092 --> 01:42:40,629

with that slimy squid.

1707
01:42:40,663 --> 01:42:42,264
Yes, girl, go!

1708
01:42:42,298 --> 01:42:44,633

what's happened.

1709

- Okay.
- Oh...

1711
01:42:47,102 --> 01:42:48,571
What do I... What...
What do I do?

1712
01:42:48,604 --> 01:42:50,439
You give me a lift
to the castle.

1713
01:42:50,473 --> 01:42:54,042
We got to find a way
to stall that engagement.

1714
01:43:00,449 --> 01:43:02,718
Really is very special.

1715
01:43:02,752 --> 01:43:05,120
Heroism's too strong
a word for it,

1716
01:43:06,555 --> 01:43:09,291
but I suppose
I did save Eric.

1717
01:43:09,325 --> 01:43:11,126
That's what
anyone would do.
Of course.

1718
01:43:11,159 --> 01:43:12,661
- Grimsby.
- Sire.

1719
01:43:13,496 --> 01:43:14,797
Have you seen Ariel?

1720
01:43:14,830 --> 01:43:15,930
According to the servants,

1721
01:43:15,964 --> 01:43:17,600
she left the castle
early this morning.

1722
01:43:17,633 --> 01:43:18,768
Left?

1723
01:43:18,801 --> 01:43:20,336
Can you
blame her, Eric?

1724
01:43:20,369 --> 01:43:23,171
I don't understand.
This is not like you.

1725
01:43:24,005 --> 01:43:25,641
I'm not sure
I understand it myself.

1726
01:43:27,041 --> 01:43:28,811
I just wanted to...

1727
01:43:28,844 --> 01:43:30,279
- I thought if...
- Eric.

1728
01:43:31,213 --> 01:43:32,214
Thank you.

1729
01:43:34,683 --> 01:43:36,619
I don't really know
what I wanted.

1730
01:43:45,828 --> 01:43:47,396
Almost there!

1731
01:43:47,430 --> 01:43:51,600
Now, when I give
the signal,
you drop me!

1732
01:43:51,634 --> 01:43:52,902
Got it?
Got it.

1733
01:43:52,934 --> 01:43:54,703
No, you idiot...

1734
01:43:56,004 --> 01:43:57,540
Guess I'm on my own.

1735
01:44:00,843 --> 01:44:02,645
My darling,

1736
01:44:02,678 --> 01:44:05,980

1737
01:44:06,014 --> 01:44:08,784
And I'd like you
to have it.

1738

Your happiness means
everything to me.

1739

1740

Uh, would you excuse me?

1742
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:27,503
Oh, Eric.

1743
01:44:27,536 --> 01:44:29,872
It's beautiful.

1744
01:44:31,874 --> 01:44:33,909
What in the...
The ring.

1745
01:44:33,943 --> 01:44:35,611
The ring. I lost...

1746
01:44:35,644 --> 01:44:37,213
Has anybody
seen the ring?

1747
01:44:37,246 --> 01:44:38,447
Have you seen
the ring?

1748
01:44:39,415 --> 01:44:40,449
Have you seen it?

1749
01:44:42,050 --> 01:44:43,919
Get off me,
you filthy bird!

1750
01:44:49,592 --> 01:44:52,495
Help me!
I'm being attacked!

1751
01:44:54,430 --> 01:44:57,198
Ariel! Ariel,
I've been
looking for you.

1752
01:44:57,233 --> 01:44:59,502
- Who is that?

1753
01:44:59,535 --> 01:45:01,002
What are you doing?

1754
01:45:02,103 --> 01:45:03,339
Grimsby,
let me go!
Sire!

1755
01:45:03,372 --> 01:45:04,907
Get her
away from me!

1756
01:45:04,940 --> 01:45:06,308
She's insane!

1757
01:45:06,342 --> 01:45:07,810
What's going on?

1758
01:45:07,843 --> 01:45:09,445
Ariel, stop!

1759
01:45:11,814 --> 01:45:13,014
Get off!

1760
01:45:44,847 --> 01:45:46,348
Ariel.

1761
01:45:47,316 --> 01:45:48,450
Yes.

1762
01:45:49,718 --> 01:45:51,085
It was you all along.

1763
01:45:52,521 --> 01:45:53,522
I should've known.

1764
01:45:55,524 --> 01:45:57,560
I don't know
what came over me.

1765
01:45:57,593 --> 01:45:58,561
She bewitched you.

1766
01:45:58,594 --> 01:46:00,128
Get away from her!

1767
01:46:00,161 --> 01:46:01,597
Eric, I want you
to know I...

1768
01:46:01,630 --> 01:46:02,798
Oh, just kiss!

1769
01:46:02,831 --> 01:46:03,866
I want you
to know everything.

1770
01:46:03,899 --> 01:46:05,166
Nothing matters now.

1771
01:46:07,369 --> 01:46:09,203
No!

1772
01:46:22,318 --> 01:46:25,220
Oh, good Lord.
She's a sea creature.

1773
01:46:25,788 --> 01:46:28,189
You're too late!

1774
01:46:29,291 --> 01:46:32,962
You're too late!

1775
01:46:41,837 --> 01:46:42,938
Stay back!

1776
01:46:42,972 --> 01:46:44,138
Shut up!

1777
01:46:46,609 --> 01:46:47,843
Eric!

1778
01:46:54,115 --> 01:46:56,352
Eric, no.

1779
01:46:56,385 --> 01:46:57,786
This is the work
of the sea gods.

1780
01:46:57,820 --> 01:46:58,854
I warned you.

1781
01:46:58,887 --> 01:47:00,556
Their whole
world is evil.

1782
01:47:00,589 --> 01:47:02,791
Eric, wait! Eric!

1783
01:47:06,462 --> 01:47:08,397
- What are you doing?
- Let go of me!

1784
01:47:08,430 --> 01:47:11,100
Not a chance.
You made a deal,
remember?

1785
01:47:11,132 --> 01:47:12,735
Three days, no kiss.

1786
01:47:13,869 --> 01:47:16,271
Yeah,
is it all comin'
back to ya?

1787
01:47:16,905 --> 01:47:18,574
I thought so.

1788
01:47:18,607 --> 01:47:21,175
Well, now
you gotta live
with it, toots.

1789
01:47:33,288 --> 01:47:35,324
Ursula!

1790
01:47:36,659 --> 01:47:39,028
Let her go.

1791
01:47:39,061 --> 01:47:40,896
Forget it,
Big Brother.

1792
01:47:40,929 --> 01:47:43,532
She belongs
to me now.

1793
01:47:47,936 --> 01:47:49,938
Oh, you see?

1794
01:47:49,972 --> 01:47:51,807
We made a deal.

1795
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:53,142
In blood.

1796
01:47:53,174 --> 01:47:56,311
It's unbreakable,
even for you.

1797
01:47:56,345 --> 01:47:58,914
I'm sorry, Father.
This is all my fault.

1798
01:47:58,947 --> 01:48:00,716
What do you want
with my daughter?

1799
01:48:00,749 --> 01:48:01,750
Oh.

1800
01:48:02,117 --> 01:48:03,886
Nothing.

1801
01:48:03,919 --> 01:48:05,854
It's you I want.

1802
01:48:05,888 --> 01:48:07,523
I want to see
you suffer,

1803
01:48:07,556 --> 01:48:10,592
like I've suffered
all these years.

1804
01:48:10,626 --> 01:48:14,229
And the daughter
of the great Sea King

1805
01:48:14,263 --> 01:48:17,198
is a very
precious commodity.

1806
01:48:17,232 --> 01:48:19,768
Oh, poor,
unfortunate soul.

1807
01:48:20,302 --> 01:48:22,004
Hey!
Get her, boys!

1808
01:48:26,075 --> 01:48:28,377
Uh-uh.
I wouldn't.

1809
01:48:30,345 --> 01:48:31,714
Shocking,
isn't it?

1810
01:48:33,182 --> 01:48:34,883
Of course,
I always was a gal

1811
01:48:34,917 --> 01:48:37,286
with an eye
for a bargain.

1812
01:48:37,319 --> 01:48:40,522
What do you say
to a trade, hmm?

1813
01:48:40,556 --> 01:48:43,092
What's your precious
little Ariel worth to ya?

1814
01:48:57,239 --> 01:48:59,475
It's mine now.

1815
01:49:05,848 --> 01:49:07,015
No!

1816
01:49:09,219 --> 01:49:10,719
Father!

1817
01:49:27,102 --> 01:49:28,670
You...

1818
01:49:28,704 --> 01:49:29,905
You monster!

1819
01:49:32,074 --> 01:49:34,009
Don't be a fool,
you little brat!

1820
01:49:34,943 --> 01:49:36,512
You are powerless against...

1821
01:49:38,180 --> 01:49:39,948
You're gonna
pay for that.

1822
01:49:41,116 --> 01:49:42,317
Get him!

1823
01:49:51,193 --> 01:49:54,329
Say goodbye
to your human heartthrob.

1824
01:49:54,363 --> 01:49:56,064
Don't!

1825
01:49:57,366 --> 01:49:58,567
Ahh!

1826
01:49:58,967 --> 01:50:00,002
My babies!

1827
01:50:28,130 --> 01:50:29,265
Eric!

1828
01:50:35,637 --> 01:50:37,706
Get to shore.
She'll kill you!

1829
01:50:37,739 --> 01:50:40,375
I'm not leaving you!

1830
01:50:51,954 --> 01:50:55,090
Yes!

1831
01:50:55,123 --> 01:50:56,458
Give me your hand!

1832
01:51:00,095 --> 01:51:01,363
Now!

1833
01:51:11,907 --> 01:51:12,908
Look out!

1834
01:51:16,712 --> 01:51:19,615
Now I rule the seas

1835
01:51:19,648 --> 01:51:24,019
and all will be helpless
under my power!

1836
01:51:28,358 --> 01:51:29,758
No!

1837
01:51:30,425 --> 01:51:33,695
So much for true love.

1838
01:52:37,559 --> 01:52:40,562
So long, lover boy.

1839
01:55:22,558 --> 01:55:24,993
You gave
your life for me.

1840
01:55:27,896 --> 01:55:30,999
And you fought
to get my life back.

1841
01:55:34,035 --> 01:55:36,138
I didn't fight
alone, Father.

1842
01:55:37,573 --> 01:55:40,142
Eric was with me.

1843
01:55:43,078 --> 01:55:47,316
All that matters now
is that you're safe
and home.

1844
01:55:49,084 --> 01:55:50,386
Where you belong.

1845
01:56:24,152 --> 01:56:26,422
- Sire, please!
- We need a boat.

1846
01:56:26,455 --> 01:56:28,624
Grimsby,
we have
to find her!

1847
01:56:28,658 --> 01:56:30,025
And then what?

1848
01:56:34,930 --> 01:56:38,234
And then
what, Eric?

1849
01:56:40,670 --> 01:56:41,970
Darling.

1850
01:56:43,573 --> 01:56:44,940
You were right.

1851
01:56:46,509 --> 01:56:48,311
I was chasing
after a fantasy girl.

1852
01:56:48,344 --> 01:56:51,746
No. No,
I was wrong.

1853
01:56:51,780 --> 01:56:53,915
She was very real.

1854
01:56:53,949 --> 01:56:56,452
And so were
your feelings for her,
I see that now.

1855
01:56:57,786 --> 01:56:59,120
It's just that...

1856
01:57:01,357 --> 01:57:04,125
our worlds
were never meant
to be together.

1857
01:57:50,673 --> 01:57:52,475
Sebastian!

1858
01:57:56,811 --> 01:57:58,748
You gotta be
kidding me.

1859
01:58:12,027 --> 01:58:13,928
Yes,
Your Majesty.

1860
01:58:15,431 --> 01:58:19,402
I have always tried to do
what's best for our people.

1861
01:58:19,435 --> 01:58:21,903
Yes,
Your Majesty.

1862
01:58:21,936 --> 01:58:24,105
And what's best
for my daughters.

1863
01:58:24,139 --> 01:58:26,107
Indeed,
Your Majesty.

1864
01:58:27,108 --> 01:58:29,445
And I've done everything
in my power

1865
01:58:29,478 --> 01:58:31,514
to make her happy.

1866
01:58:34,216 --> 01:58:37,118
Well, not quite.

1867
01:58:45,561 --> 01:58:46,995
She wants
a different life

1868
01:58:47,028 --> 01:58:48,431
than I had
planned for her.

1869
01:58:48,464 --> 01:58:51,400
She did try
to tell you, Your Majesty.

1870
01:58:53,168 --> 01:58:55,970
But I won't be able
to protect her anymore.

1871
01:58:56,004 --> 01:58:58,139
Well, it's like
I always say,

1872
01:58:58,173 --> 01:59:01,544
children got to be free
to lead their own lives.

1873
01:59:01,577 --> 01:59:03,111
Oh, is that what
you always say?

1874
01:59:03,144 --> 01:59:04,480
Somethin' like that.
Yeah.

1875
01:59:08,217 --> 01:59:10,919
Then there's just
one problem left.

1876
01:59:10,952 --> 01:59:13,088
And what's that,
Your Majesty?

1877
01:59:14,390 --> 01:59:17,025
How much I'm going
to miss my little one.

1878
01:59:49,492 --> 01:59:51,192
Good boy.
Go on.

1879
02:00:02,438 --> 02:00:03,439
Again?

1880
02:00:17,486 --> 02:00:18,487
Max?

1881
02:01:16,212 --> 02:01:18,414
Blessings
to you both.

1882
02:01:19,215 --> 02:01:20,850
Magical news, yeah.

1883
02:01:20,883 --> 02:01:22,284
Oh, what's all this,
Grims?

1884
02:01:22,318 --> 02:01:24,118
Oh, the Queen wanted
the two of you

1885
02:01:24,152 --> 02:01:26,288
to have
a proper
send-off, sire.

1886
02:01:26,322 --> 02:01:27,923
Thank you,
Your Majesty.

1887
02:01:27,957 --> 02:01:30,593
No. Thank you.

1888
02:01:30,626 --> 02:01:32,093
Much as
I hate farewells,

1889
02:01:32,126 --> 02:01:34,830
we still have cause
to celebrate.

1890
02:01:34,864 --> 02:01:39,301
Our worlds have
misunderstood one another
for far too long.

1891
02:01:39,335 --> 02:01:42,505
Your marriage marks
a new beginning for us.

1892
02:01:42,538 --> 02:01:44,773
Yes. A beginning.

1893
02:01:45,574 --> 02:01:46,575
Now,

1894
02:01:47,041 --> 02:01:48,711
get out there

1895
02:01:48,744 --> 02:01:50,246
and change the world,

1896
02:01:50,279 --> 02:01:51,580
or whatever it is
you have to do,

1897
02:01:51,614 --> 02:01:52,615
so we don't
get left behind.

1898
02:01:53,349 --> 02:01:54,950
That doesn't sound
like my mother.

1899
02:01:54,984 --> 02:01:56,385
What have you
done with her?
Oh!

1900
02:01:56,418 --> 02:01:58,754
Off you go.

1901
02:01:59,922 --> 02:02:02,358
Have you decided
where you're
headed first?

1902
02:02:03,859 --> 02:02:05,427
Uncharted waters.

1903
02:02:05,461 --> 02:02:06,328
Okay!

1904
02:02:06,362 --> 02:02:07,796
A mermaid and a man.

1905
02:02:08,831 --> 02:02:10,499
Whoever would
have imagined?

1906
02:02:14,637 --> 02:02:16,605
Well, look who's here.

1907
02:02:16,639 --> 02:02:18,841
We got you
something, Ariel.
Sure did.

1908
02:02:18,874 --> 02:02:20,743
Something
you almost lost.

1909
02:02:20,776 --> 02:02:21,877
Where...
Where is it?

1910
02:02:21,911 --> 02:02:23,679
You're sittin'
on it, bird.

1911
02:02:23,712 --> 02:02:25,079
Ow!

1912
02:02:26,549 --> 02:02:28,217
My little mermaid.

1913
02:02:30,886 --> 02:02:32,454
Keep her for me.

1914
02:02:32,488 --> 02:02:35,189
I hope she causes you
less trouble than I did.

1915
02:02:35,224 --> 02:02:37,893
I was right about
the dinglehopper,
wasn't I?

1916
02:02:37,927 --> 02:02:40,229
Yes, you were, Scuttle.
You were.

1917
02:02:40,262 --> 02:02:42,130
You won't
be gone too long,

1918
02:02:42,163 --> 02:02:44,366
- will you, Ariel?
- Of course not.

1919
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:46,134
I'll be back
by the next Coral Moon.

1920
02:02:47,269 --> 02:02:48,971
Yeah, don't be
late this time.

1921
02:03:09,792 --> 02:03:10,793
You ready?

1922
02:03:14,029 --> 02:03:15,230
Yes.

1923
02:03:15,998 --> 02:03:17,666
