1
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:10,767
Illyria...

2
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:14,643
It is that place lying between
The country just left...

3
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:17,581
And the country just ahead.

4
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:21,552
A faraway land, where the only
Enemy is convention...

5
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:25,750
And love is free to weave
Its golden thread wherever it may.

6
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:31,630
Illyria, 1970.

7
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:21,879
Let's be buried
Here together, baby.

8
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,449
Alive?

9
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:28,285
Yes, alive.

10
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:36,495
Cyril, baby, don't smoke,
For god's sake.

11
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,832
What's wrong with my cigarette?

12
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,873
Little boys have been
Relieving themselves in here.

13
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,771
You can smell it.

14
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:46,174
You're making
Me nervous, okay?

15
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:51,216
If little boys can make water,
Then i can make smoke.

16
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:57,079
My god...

17
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,351
I found the skeleton
Of a child.

18
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:05,059
Head, ribs...

19
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:07,792
Hands, feet,
The whole works.

20
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,766
Oh, how could
They do it?

21
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,475
So beautiful...

22
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,549
Poor little thing.

23
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:28,679
I'm going to kiss him, cyril.
Shall i?

24
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:39,058
I want to light
A candle, okay?

25
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,515
Sure, who are you
Going to light it for?

26
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:45,731
Oh, i don't know.

27
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,136
Is it fire?

28
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,267
I don't know.
Let's go and find out.

29
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,492
They're laughing!

30
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,724
Come on, baby,
I want to see!

31
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,505
- Let's go.
- Come on, baby!

32
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:01,678
Do something cyril,
There's someone still inside!

33
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:04,431
There's no need. The fire
Brigade's doing a grand job.

34
00:08:04,432 --> 00:08:06,384
Get rid of all that
Stuff before you take us off...

35
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:09,377
Get the ropes off. You can't
Carry us at the same time.

36
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,684
No, get rid
Of those ropes. Go.

37
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,192
Come on,
Let's get close.

38
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:18,320
Hugh, can you
Come up, please?

39
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,132
Baby, that little girl
Is waving at me!

40
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:41,386
Oh, cyril,
He's handsome.

41
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,529
Oh, my god,
He's handsome!

42
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:09,141
You always knew what
You wanted, didn't you, fiona?

43
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,341
And from the first,
You wanted hugh.

44
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,621
It was fate that spun
Their motorbus off the dirt road

45
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,245
And into the river
That day.

46
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,320
And it was our good fortune
To be on hand for the rescue.

47
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,538
And safe delivery
Of the stranded family

48
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,724
To the shores of illyria...

49
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,697
And our welcoming arms.

50
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,332
There.
Now you'll be safe.

51
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,834
Here, i'll take her.

52
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,288
Oh, my god.

53
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,422
- You all right?
- Yes. Thank you.

54
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,499
- They nearly dropped you in!
- I know.

55
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,130
Welcome ashore.

56
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,299
Thank you.

57
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,122
You're not shivering,
Are you?

58
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:35,156
My wife thinks you must
Be exhausted after your dunking in the river.

59
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,829
She's worried about you.

60
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,571
Hugh?

61
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,572
She admires your courage.

62
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,308
Fiona's character judgments
Are always right.

63
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,866
Fiona?

64
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,947
We've been married
A long time.

65
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,616
Married a long time...?

66
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,655
We've been travelling
For over a year.

67
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:05,722
I see.

68
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,662
Where?

69
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,292
Can't even remember where.

70
00:11:10,293 --> 00:11:12,737
Wherever hugh wanted
To take his photographs.

71
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,332
Sort of blurs into
Packing and unpacking.

72
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:22,880
Fiona and i have also
Been married a long time.

73
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:26,247
In fact, fiona's a kind
Of priestess of marriage.

74
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,545
It's late, do you want
To be sitting out here?

75
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,451
I like your voice
In the darkness.

76
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:36,911
Okay.

77
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,631
Wouldn't it be better if
You were with the children?

78
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,201
You needn't worry about
Me or the children.

79
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:45,998
Meredith will shout
If there's a problem.

80
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,971
We hardly know each other...

81
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,408
Fiona!

82
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:54,479
I'm a lot older
Than you think.

83
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,811
I'm 40.

84
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,155
Ah.

85
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:07,248
Baby, sharing secrets?

86
00:12:07,249 --> 00:12:09,461
No, we're just talking.
Why don't you join us?

87
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,920
I couldn't sit still.
Not tonight.

88
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:16,160
I'm so glad you're here.
I want you here.

89
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:17,792
You and hugh.

90
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,232
Easy, fiona,
Calm down.

91
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,897
Oh, cyril,
Don't be stuffy.

92
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,339
At least catherine
Doesn't think i'm stuffy.

93
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,278
Catherine and i were having a nice
Conversation until you came along.

94
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,579
Sharing secrets,
I know... Drinking wine.

95
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,379
You're perfect, baby.

96
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:39,886
Cyril's different
From other men.

97
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:41,687
Do you like him?

98
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:43,557
Do you like my cyril?

99
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:46,722
Of course she likes me.

100
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,766
Baby, you ruin everything.

101
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,665
Well...!

102
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,402
Okay...

103
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,273
You asked for it.

104
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:04,911
Fiona!

105
00:13:07,672 --> 00:13:09,754
Where were we?

106
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,484
- Fiona!
- Shh!

107
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,888
Quiet, you two...
You'll wake the children.

108
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,658
We were talking.
What about?

109
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:23,735
Ourselves. Exactly.

110
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,805
Telling each
Other heart-stoppers, fiona would say.

111
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:32,275
So...

112
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:35,836
Do you think you see me
As fiona sees me?

113
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,438
The perfect man?

114
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,480
Yes. But it doesn't have
Much to do with me.

115
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,519
Not even now?

116
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:47,953
Of course,
Fiona exaggerates.

117
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,893
I'm a lot more ordinary than
She'd lead you to believe.

118
00:13:50,894 --> 00:13:52,664
You asked for a secret,
I told you.

119
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,828
- Good, tell me another.
- No. It's your turn.

120
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,529
What's in your pocket?
What did she give you?

121
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:01,470
Just her panties.
They're not important.

122
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,804
- Why did she take them off?
- I don't know.

123
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,570
Do you care?

124
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,906
I don't know.

125
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:09,842
Trust me.

126
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,852
You remind me of my father.

127
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,618
Listen.

128
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:20,783
Listen a moment.

129
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:22,417
What?

130
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,758
Damn, i knew it.

131
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,661
They've woken the children.

132
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:29,290
- I don't hear anything.
- Come on, let's go.

133
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,404
Usually i hear
If there's a cry.

134
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,878
I have very sharp ears.

135
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,543
There's dolores...

136
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:50,622
And eveline...

137
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,181
And over there,
Is our big girl, meredith.

138
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:57,262
We are going to be sleeping
In there, hugh and i.

139
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,458
All safe, no nightmares.

140
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,898
No, they won't wake up.

141
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:07,166
Fiona and that noisy
Husband of yours may try.

142
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,468
I'm glad we looked.

143
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,226
You're thinking
About your children?

144
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,697
Yes.

145
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,260
My children.

146
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,175
In all this confusion,
Can you find your pajamas?

147
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:47,703
Yes.

148
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,139
Put them on.

149
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,255
I'll be back in
Twenty minutes.

150
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,585
All right.

151
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:22,808
It has been six months
Since all of you departed.

152
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,310
I miss you, fiona.

153
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,589
I hear your footsteps
On the metal stairs,

154
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,816
And look for you in rooms
I imagined you've just left.

155
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:40,294
Without you, my only comfort
Is faith in our illyrian dream.

156
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,760
I live on with rosella,

157
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,599
My maid,

158
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:48,172
My shadow,

159
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,434
Who understands
Nothing i say but...

160
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:53,602
Whose eyes tell me
She judges everything i do.

161
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,916
You do not know rosella,

162
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,080
Except from hugh's photographs.

163
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,747
Though that should be enough.

164
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:43,760
Come on catherine, you know
You still want me to woo you.

165
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:49,567
Stop being a child, catherine.
Take the flowers.

166
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,542
I shan't give up.

167
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,477
I shall continue to come here
Week after week.

168
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,641
Year after year, if need be...

169
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,742
Until you get better.

170
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:12,155
What can i say
To rouse you?

171
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:20,728
I might have prevented our...
What did i call it?

172
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:23,762
Idyll.

173
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,270
I could have...

174
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,136
Walked down to the beach...

175
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:33,211
And thrown pebbles into the night
Sea for a couple of hours.

176
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,876
But a steady,
Methodical...

177
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,578
Un-designing lover,
Like me...

178
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:45,389
Really has no choice,
Catherine.

179
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:49,688
The glasses come off
In my hand,

180
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,456
The dressing gown
Falls open.

181
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:57,698
I close the wings
Of the glasses. No choice.

182
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:04,100
Don't forget, you were
Waiting for me, catherine.

183
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,200
We both knew
You were waiting.

184
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,546
Neither of us had
Any choice that first night.

185
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,115
It was inevitable.

186
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,217
Cyril?

187
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,183
Is it you?

188
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,816
I know it's you, baby.

189
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,289
Stop hiding.

190
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,593
It's me, fiona,
You know it's me.

191
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,357
How are the grapes?

192
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:02,490
We're going to sit up
And watch the sun rise.

193
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:03,966
Okay, baby?

194
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:05,468
Great idea.

195
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:07,669
Great.

196
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:45,458
I wonder if they're lying
In bed together, right now.

197
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:47,736
Like us.

198
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:52,617
Would it change anything?

199
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,551
It might explain what
I'm doing here with you.

200
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,554
You think so?

201
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:00,324
No.

202
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:06,193
As a matter of fact...

203
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:09,756
They are both just sitting up
Together, to watch the sunrise.

204
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,206
- Is that better?
- It's worse.

205
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:18,693
Why?

206
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,312
I don't know.

207
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,390
I can give you clarity...

208
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,455
But not understanding.

209
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,399
Don't be prudish.

210
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:44,594
I'm not.

211
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:54,672
Your shoulder's cold.

212
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:01,355
Cyril?

213
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,487
Are they staying away
From us on purpose?

214
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,841
It's only been a few hours.

215
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,286
More or less.

216
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,484
It's been a day.

217
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,457
A whole day...

218
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:32,478
Perhaps they just don't
Want to intrude?

219
00:24:32,479 --> 00:24:36,440
I hope they don't end up
Like those other two.

220
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:37,840
Remember?

221
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:42,206
Greatest ever beginning,
Then...

222
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,305
Quick fizzle.

223
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,350
Yes, i remember.

224
00:24:58,396 --> 00:25:00,296
Kiss me, cyril.

225
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:05,598
You're not in the least
Interested in kissing old cyril.

226
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:08,366
Why pretend?

227
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:10,100
You're right, baby.

228
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,278
How did you know?

229
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,712
Hi...!

230
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,723
Come on over!

231
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:30,523
Oh cyril, come look at them.
They're all dressed up.

232
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,427
Found this in the luggage.
I thought you'd like it.

233
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:41,436
- Pretty formal, don't you think?
- But sweet baby, sweet.

234
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,407
- Shall we try it?
- No thanks, not me.

235
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:50,208
- Hugh's been sick.
- Oh dear, what's wrong?

236
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:53,876
Cramps, diarrhea,
Weakness.

237
00:25:53,877 --> 00:25:55,286
Oh, dear.
Are you feeling better?

238
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:56,620
Ask catherine.
She'll tell you.

239
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:58,431
- Hugh's all right.
- You can see he is.

240
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:01,425
Yes. Great pan
Is not dead, hm?

241
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:03,460
What a lovely
Bottle of cognac.

242
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:07,263
- Terrific.
- How are the kids?

243
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:09,230
Fine, fine.

244
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:11,199
Meredith is babysitting.

245
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:15,098
Time for a spot
Of grape tasting, i think.

246
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,333
Oh yes, cyril...

247
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:19,910
The grape tasting game.
You must play.

248
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:35,549
Is this the game?

249
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,261
Now, is this the game?

250
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,202
Right,
This is the game.

251
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:50,900
It's very easy.

252
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:53,310
You keep your hands
Behind your back...

253
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:56,508
- or in your case, your hand...
- oh, my god! Cyril!

254
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:58,577
Sorry...

255
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:04,849
...and go for the grapes.
With our mouths.

256
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,481
No grapes for me.
No, thanks.

257
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:11,289
You don't need to eat them. Try and
Catch them between your lips, and...

258
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:12,886
Pull them down.

259
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:16,195
Why can't we pick a bunch
With our hands and sit under a tree?

260
00:27:16,196 --> 00:27:18,636
Let's do what
Cyril says, hugh, please?

261
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,104
Come on, hugh.

262
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:26,813
That is very funny.

263
00:27:26,814 --> 00:27:30,381
All right, catherine,
You going to try it?

264
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:32,350
Oh no, not me.

265
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,350
Go on, i'll pick you up.

266
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:36,420
- Your turn.
- All right.

267
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:39,213
The honor
Of the family.

268
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,255
Put your hands
Behind your back.

269
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:43,885
Put both feet
On the table.

270
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:52,459
You missed. Try again.

271
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:54,772
I lost my balance.

272
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:57,777
They're only grapes,
Come on, try it.

273
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:58,867
Nipples!

274
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:02,838
Oh, hugh -!

275
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:05,746
That's what you mean.

276
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,284
Suit yourself,
But they're just grapes.

277
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:09,944
Nipples, indeed.

278
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,854
Good girl.

279
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:17,390
Catherine!

280
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:19,326
Enough, enough.

281
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:36,971
What's this, fella?

282
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:38,913
Arm around
My wife's shoulders?

283
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,654
Come on, baby!
Let's do the grape.

284
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:55,364
Baby, i want to nibble
Each one of them.

285
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:56,934
Me too.

286
00:28:57,262 --> 00:29:02,206
"What shall we do
With the drunken sailor...

287
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,641
What shall we do
With the drunken sailor...

288
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,940
What shall we do
With the drunken sailor...

289
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:10,776
Early in the morning."

290
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:57,525
Hi, baby!

291
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,424
What are you doing?

292
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,097
Hi, fiona.

293
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,629
Fancy a swim?

294
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:19,316
- Bye everyone.
- Bye.

295
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:21,647
Why don't you take a
Photograph? Look there.

296
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:23,243
No, thanks.

297
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,011
That should do it.

298
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:00,274
Let's go.

299
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:18,926
There.

300
00:31:23,848 --> 00:31:26,316
Perfect, perfect.
Let's hunt her down.

301
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:29,536
No.

302
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:33,213
You wait here.
When she's warmed up,

303
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:35,087
I'll wave.

304
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:54,775
These sullen types
Always end up compliant.

305
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,483
Smile at her...

306
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,576
Make her feel at ease.

307
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:17,399
Peasant nudes.

308
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:23,942
That's what i'm going to call
My collection. "Peasant nudes."

309
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:30,173
Perfect.

310
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:33,743
Perfect.

311
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:36,276
Now...

312
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:38,947
Let's just push her over
Against that stall.

313
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:44,486
Easy...

314
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:46,279
Easy...

315
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:49,496
Easy...

316
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,601
Perfect.

317
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:59,537
Perfect.

318
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,442
Most of the faces of these women
Are just fat and happy.

319
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,975
They're all mothers...

320
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,949
With or without children.

321
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:11,279
But this face...

322
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:13,414
Is skin tight.

323
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,153
With the beauty of...

324
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,688
The beauty
Of illiteracy.

325
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:24,600
Sullen face
Of an illiterate virgin.

326
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:27,494
She couldn't be better.

327
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:35,207
Make her smile.

328
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:37,281
- What?
- Come on, do something.

329
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:38,576
Make her smile.

330
00:33:44,589 --> 00:33:46,716
- No, not there.
- Sorry.

331
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,997
Time to change tactics.

332
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:09,571
- Want some?
- Thank you.

333
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:12,577
It's hot work.

334
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:15,310
Now to business.

335
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,513
No boots, no dress.

336
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,286
No boots...

337
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,440
No dress.

338
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:38,200
Go on, cyril, give her the rake.
Let's try the rake.

339
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,456
Give her the machete.

340
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:03,096
- Take the rake away.
- Sorry.

341
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:11,034
Magnificent. I've spent over
A year on my collection.

342
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:13,838
My catalog of natural
Art photographs.

343
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,412
I have them
Sitting in hay...

344
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:18,103
Standing in the darkened
Doorways of ruined barns...

345
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:23,112
All nude.
Or semi-nude.

346
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:26,747
My peasant specimens.

347
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:28,052
In the bag...

348
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:30,389
There's some underwear.
Get them, will you?

349
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:41,395
Give them to her.

350
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:06,629
Should i have placed myself

351
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:10,997
Between rosella and
Hugh's probing camera?

352
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:13,900
By doing nothing i became
Hugh's willing accomplice.

353
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:18,169
But who was i, the advocate
Of sensual abandon,

354
00:36:18,276 --> 00:36:20,301
To stand in the way
Of his desire?

355
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,575
Had i interfered,

356
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,845
I would have become
The worst possible hypocrite.

357
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:31,080
Even in illyria there
Are difficult choices.

358
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,522
And every choice
Has its consequence.

359
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:37,185
You and i always knew
That life among the roses

360
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:38,990
Would not be
Without thorns.

361
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,660
Didn't we, fiona?

362
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:45,565
Here you are again, rosella.

363
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,865
The girl by the well.

364
00:36:57,281 --> 00:37:02,446
For my part, i have paid dearly
For living our illyrian dream.

365
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,544
Where once i was your satyr,

366
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:07,089
I am now impotent.

367
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:09,659
Rosella is
My unwitting torturer.

368
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,796
There was a time
When her candid sensuality

369
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:15,664
Would have aroused
My desire without fail.

370
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:17,927
But not anymore.

371
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:22,301
Now i seek solace in
The rituals of domestic life.

372
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:44,291
I see you eat the bones
As well, rosella.

373
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:47,362
And the feet.

374
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:52,196
For the full effect we must
Eat the entire bird, hm?

375
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,575
Mmm...
Magnificent.

376
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:51,452
Where are we?
Tell me quick.

377
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:53,792
We're in illyria.
Do you like it?

378
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:55,422
I like you, baby.

379
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:57,851
You.

380
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,213
Come on you two,
Quit lagging!

381
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:18,983
Cyril baby,
Don't say anything.

382
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,352
Don't spoil it.

383
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:24,761
- What's that?
- Sheep bells.

384
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,996
Do you see what i see?

385
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,658
Goats, not sheep.

386
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:33,862
But the girl, baby,
Look at the girl.

387
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,445
She's just a child.

388
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,949
Young woman.
Seventeen, i should think.

389
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:53,556
She's so beautiful.

390
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,660
Fiona... Sit down,
You'll fall.

391
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:58,991
It's all right, fella,
I've got ahold of her.

392
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:03,126
Oh look...

393
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,758
Baby, she sees us.

394
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,289
Hi!

395
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,334
Come on, baby...

396
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:17,539
Kiss her. She probably thinks
You're some kind of god.

397
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:19,411
Well, of course
She does.

398
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:39,395
Come on, hugh.

399
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:41,368
How about it?

400
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,940
Pass, one woman
Is enough for me.

401
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:47,169
Oh come on, hugh. Kiss her
Just once, like cyril did.

402
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,743
Catherine won't mind.

403
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:52,145
I don't care
If he kisses her or not.

404
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:53,939
Doesn't care,
Did you hear that?

405
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:56,851
I mean it hugh,
Kiss her.

406
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,979
If that's what you want.

407
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:00,681
Cyril, save us.

408
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:04,323
Fun's over.

409
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:08,790
All right, hugh...

410
00:41:08,791 --> 00:41:10,967
Since you didn't kiss
Our little goat girl...

411
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,868
Why don't you
Kiss me instead?

412
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:16,972
Maybe another day.

413
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:19,568
Come on, catherine.

414
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:41,395
He says he's the only man in
The world who can resist my charm.

415
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:44,798
What'll i do?

416
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:47,666
I did warn you
He might not work.

417
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:49,238
Remember?

418
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,865
I remember.

419
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:54,706
He just can't see that

420
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:58,475
Anything that lies in
The palm of love is good.

421
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:07,987
He stays all night
In that studio.

422
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:11,553
I hope he comes 'round

423
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:14,028
For your sake.

424
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,857
I'm not giving up yet, baby.

425
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:19,902
Not yet.

426
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,596
No, of course not.

427
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:26,539
Ah!

428
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:29,975
I see you're wearing
Your magic pants again.

429
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:38,082
You're wearing your
Magic pants too, aren't you?

430
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:39,416
Of course, i am.

431
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:42,083
Maybe i'll steal
Your magic pants.

432
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,854
For him, okay?

433
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,864
I wanna see your
Magic pants, baby.

434
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:54,301
Right now.

435
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:16,526
Submit.

436
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:21,622
Kiss me, cyril.

437
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:26,329
Kiss me.

438
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:39,915
Oh, baby...

439
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:44,679
why can't they
All be like you?

440
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:48,388
Why?

441
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:09,743
- Cyril?
- Hm?

442
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:12,372
We don't have
To go back yet, do we?

443
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,816
Come on, let's play.

444
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:24,618
Please?

445
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:55,114
Oh, baby...

446
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:57,193
Can't we just stay
Like this forever?

447
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:01,954
That's it, fiona.
Castration.

448
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:05,160
All these years you've been
Castrating your own husband.

449
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:07,169
Flaunting yourself
To other men.

450
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,374
My husband
Is virile.

451
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,247
Hugh...

452
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:30,723
...undo my top.

453
00:45:58,355 --> 00:45:59,879
Mommy!

454
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,548
Don't worry.
I'll go.

455
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:07,346
Mommy!

456
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:10,055
Ah, meredith.

457
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:13,034
You think i don't know
What you're doing?

458
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:15,901
There's a huge rock over there
I really want you to see.

459
00:46:15,902 --> 00:46:17,974
- I don't want to go.
- It's very interesting.

460
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:19,772
Come on, we will
Have a look.

461
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:31,753
Today, i went to the asylum
To visit catherine.

462
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:34,983
Only to find her gone
From her usual chair.

463
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:50,331
For months on end,
I have pleaded, cajoled

464
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,273
And implored catherine
To come back to herself.

465
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:54,844
To no avail.

466
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:57,679
Now...

467
00:46:57,781 --> 00:47:00,978
A couple of small rabbits
Have succeeded

468
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:03,109
Where i have failed.

469
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:32,038
For the first time
In almost a year...

470
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:35,448
I feel the gentle stirrings
Of my sensual self.

471
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:38,953
And i am certain catherine's
Recovery, and my own

472
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:41,148
Will be intertwined.

473
00:47:41,258 --> 00:47:44,091
Given time,
Our wounds will heal

474
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,458
Into small,
Silvery scars.

475
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:02,207
But some memories
Do not fade.

476
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:06,646
They are indelible,
Like blood etchings.

477
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,054
Fiona?

478
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:30,262
Hugh?

479
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:57,964
Cyril!

480
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:05,401
Cyril!

481
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:14,447
What were you
Doing out there?

482
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:16,348
Not much.

483
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:19,479
- I was looking for you, baby.
- Were you?

484
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:26,796
Come on, meredith, join in.

485
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:28,914
Where's my mother?

486
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:31,896
I told you,
They're bringing the wine.

487
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:33,872
You can't have
An idyll without wine.

488
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:37,139
I'm sick
Of your old idylls.

489
00:49:50,443 --> 00:49:52,377
You're lucky
To be here.

490
00:49:52,378 --> 00:49:54,380
If it weren't for me
You'd be in your room

491
00:49:54,381 --> 00:49:58,340
Babysitting your little sisters,
Where hugh thinks you should be.

492
00:49:58,451 --> 00:50:00,476
My father lets me
Do anything.

493
00:50:02,555 --> 00:50:05,991
Except, go to his photo studio.
Because that's his work.

494
00:50:11,935 --> 00:50:13,799
That's enough, dolores,
Leave some for meredith.

495
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,529
All right.

496
00:50:15,635 --> 00:50:19,196
Don't bother, i don't want
To make any stupid old crowns.

497
00:50:19,739 --> 00:50:21,434
And why not?

498
00:50:21,541 --> 00:50:23,338
I thought all girls
Liked crowns.

499
00:50:23,443 --> 00:50:24,493
I'll help you.

500
00:50:25,845 --> 00:50:27,608
I know what
You're doing.

501
00:50:27,714 --> 00:50:31,047
You're trying to impress
My parents. That's all.

502
00:50:31,151 --> 00:50:33,119
You're just trying
To fool them again.

503
00:50:34,087 --> 00:50:36,783
I am simply trying
To bedeck their daughters

504
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:38,881
With beautiful things.

505
00:50:38,992 --> 00:50:41,460
- It's a nice idea.
- It's dumb.

506
00:50:43,129 --> 00:50:45,120
That's enough.

507
00:50:45,231 --> 00:50:47,722
To work, meredith,
To work.

508
00:51:01,047 --> 00:51:03,481
Hey, not so hard,
The grapes will fall off.

509
00:51:06,786 --> 00:51:08,185
I want my mother.

510
00:51:14,561 --> 00:51:17,091
Some of those stems are
A little short for weaving.

511
00:51:18,731 --> 00:51:21,359
They look splendid.
Good choice of colors.

512
00:51:22,435 --> 00:51:23,732
It's falling apart.

513
00:51:29,309 --> 00:51:30,776
What do you
Think of that?

514
00:51:33,847 --> 00:51:35,337
God, you're selfish.

515
00:51:37,884 --> 00:51:40,876
I knew it would take longer to make,
So i made mine first.

516
00:51:40,987 --> 00:51:42,386
Come on,
Let's fix up yours.

517
00:51:42,489 --> 00:51:44,719
I though we were making
Them just for us.

518
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:49,488
And who's being selfish now?

519
00:51:49,596 --> 00:51:52,394
You don't need one, why do you
Have to have one, too?

520
00:51:52,499 --> 00:51:54,057
They're only for children.

521
00:51:55,335 --> 00:51:57,685
If you want me to make you
A crown as nice as mine...

522
00:51:57,770 --> 00:51:59,761
Why don't you try
A little politeness?

523
00:52:03,142 --> 00:52:04,541
Now...

524
00:52:04,644 --> 00:52:06,874
Shall we carry on,
Or do you want to stop?

525
00:52:10,617 --> 00:52:12,244
It has to be
As good as yours.

526
00:52:13,353 --> 00:52:14,718
Promise?

527
00:52:17,423 --> 00:52:18,549
I promise.

528
00:52:21,995 --> 00:52:23,986
Now, pass me one
Of those flowers.

529
00:52:38,111 --> 00:52:39,976
Hugh, look what he's done.

530
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:43,674
Catherine, look what cyril's
Done to our children.

531
00:52:43,783 --> 00:52:46,217
Oh, they're sweet,
They really are.

532
00:52:50,323 --> 00:52:51,813
Hi!

533
00:52:51,925 --> 00:52:54,985
- Meredith, you look stunning.
- You really do.

534
00:52:55,094 --> 00:52:58,063
What about me?
Don't i look stunning too?

535
00:52:58,164 --> 00:53:00,598
Jesus, look at that.

536
00:53:03,403 --> 00:53:05,928
God, fella...
What a sight.

537
00:53:06,039 --> 00:53:09,065
Don't ever take it off, baby.
Ever.

538
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:12,038
Oh, cyril.

539
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:38,999
Still the same, more or less.

540
00:53:43,943 --> 00:53:45,843
This way.

541
00:54:46,139 --> 00:54:47,189
Oh!

542
00:54:51,711 --> 00:54:53,906
Why do you spurn
Your lovers, rosella?

543
00:54:55,114 --> 00:54:56,164
Hm?

544
00:54:56,983 --> 00:54:59,474
What are you
Waiting for?

545
00:54:59,585 --> 00:55:01,450
Not me, i hope.

546
00:55:06,292 --> 00:55:09,227
Sexless matrimony
Is all i can offer.

547
00:55:11,097 --> 00:55:12,962
Even that would
Go on unspoken for.

548
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:06,443
Meredith?
What's the matter?

549
00:56:06,552 --> 00:56:07,678
Nothing.

550
00:56:09,722 --> 00:56:11,155
Your nose
Is bleeding.

551
00:56:11,257 --> 00:56:12,849
It's not...

552
00:56:12,959 --> 00:56:14,688
I'm going
To tell my father.

553
00:56:15,762 --> 00:56:17,753
Let's try and stop
This nose bleed.

554
00:56:18,163 --> 00:56:21,233
He'll kill you
For coming here.

555
00:56:21,234 --> 00:56:23,600
I'm sure, now,
Just sit, sit still.

556
00:56:28,975 --> 00:56:30,670
Well, it stopped.

557
00:56:30,671 --> 00:56:32,744
Now, you can wash all
This off in the morning.

558
00:56:32,745 --> 00:56:34,736
Go back to sleep.

559
00:56:38,918 --> 00:56:40,715
Don't worry,
You'll be fine.

560
00:57:15,955 --> 00:57:17,650
Is that you?

561
00:57:19,225 --> 00:57:20,852
Expecting someone else?

562
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,690
Just you, baby. You.

563
00:57:27,333 --> 00:57:29,358
Come on dad,
You can beat him.

564
00:57:30,102 --> 00:57:31,729
Come on, dad, do it.

565
00:57:31,838 --> 00:57:33,965
Do it just for fun.

566
00:57:36,104 --> 00:57:38,376
What do you say, fella?

567
00:57:38,377 --> 00:57:40,242
Be a good sport, baby, do it.

568
00:57:43,216 --> 00:57:46,276
One... Two...

569
00:57:46,385 --> 00:57:48,512
Three - go!

570
00:57:53,125 --> 00:57:54,558
Oh, daddy!

571
00:57:56,128 --> 00:57:58,756
I think i'll go
To the studio.

572
00:57:58,865 --> 00:57:59,915
Can i come?

573
00:57:59,932 --> 00:58:01,229
No.

574
00:58:14,614 --> 00:58:15,808
Oh!

575
00:58:15,809 --> 00:58:18,450
What's the matter,
Something wrong?

576
00:58:18,451 --> 00:58:21,443
The light.
The photos.

577
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:28,085
Oh, i'm sorry.

578
00:58:28,194 --> 00:58:29,354
I didn't realize.

579
00:58:31,831 --> 00:58:34,841
It's so bloody dark in here,
I don't know how you can stand it.

580
00:58:37,136 --> 00:58:40,697
You're sweating.
Do you have a chest problem?

581
00:58:40,806 --> 00:58:42,967
No. It's not my chest.

582
00:58:45,811 --> 00:58:49,941
Well, how about fiona?

583
00:58:50,049 --> 00:58:51,983
Fiona?

584
00:58:52,084 --> 00:58:53,847
Why not?

585
00:58:53,953 --> 00:58:55,580
God!

586
00:58:55,688 --> 00:58:57,258
Do you know
What's happening?

587
00:58:57,290 --> 00:58:59,121
Let's talk about it.

588
00:58:59,225 --> 00:59:01,695
I'm appealing to you, fella,
Don't let it happen.

589
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:05,792
Well...

590
00:59:05,898 --> 00:59:09,129
You've had your eye on fiona
Since the beginning.

591
00:59:11,103 --> 00:59:12,468
Let's reason from there.

592
00:59:12,571 --> 00:59:14,061
She's got a husband.

593
00:59:14,062 --> 00:59:16,541
- You've got a wife.
- I'm talking about you, not me.

594
00:59:16,542 --> 00:59:18,410
And the torment,
Is that yours or mine?

595
00:59:18,411 --> 00:59:21,574
You don't know what's going on
In the shadows, that's all.

596
00:59:21,681 --> 00:59:24,149
Tell me.

597
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:26,047
If we don't work together...

598
00:59:26,152 --> 00:59:29,883
If we don't stop this
Thing you'll lose her.

599
00:59:29,989 --> 00:59:33,015
- To you?
- To me.

600
00:59:33,125 --> 00:59:34,456
To me.

601
00:59:36,162 --> 00:59:37,493
Don't you see?

602
00:59:43,269 --> 00:59:46,170
Of course, i do love fiona.

603
00:59:46,272 --> 00:59:48,934
She... Wants me...

604
00:59:49,041 --> 00:59:50,633
For god's sake.

605
00:59:52,778 --> 00:59:55,908
It seems to me that what you're
Really after is my permission?

606
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:59,843
You don't mean it.
You can't.

607
00:59:59,844 --> 01:00:02,520
Well, put it this way, you want
To play footsy with fiona.

608
01:00:02,521 --> 01:00:03,571
No, you're wrong.

609
01:00:03,622 --> 01:00:06,523
And you want me to sanction
The bare feet under the table.

610
01:00:06,625 --> 01:00:09,253
For god's sake -!

611
01:00:09,362 --> 01:00:10,412
I don't.

612
01:00:10,463 --> 01:00:13,432
But why should i?
I don't expect you to.

613
01:00:13,532 --> 01:00:16,729
Why can't you play footsy with
Fiona, and leave me out of it?

614
01:00:16,836 --> 01:00:20,067
Because i couldn't do that.

615
01:00:20,172 --> 01:00:21,852
Forgotten the ten commandments?

616
01:00:23,542 --> 01:00:25,669
Keep your hands off
Another man's wife.

617
01:00:25,778 --> 01:00:28,804
Written in stone, fella,
Written in stone.

618
01:00:30,383 --> 01:00:32,374
Trying to do you a favor.

619
01:00:32,375 --> 01:00:34,919
Do we really have to have
All this male camaraderie

620
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:36,820
In matters of love?

621
01:00:36,922 --> 01:00:38,355
I thought you'd listen.

622
01:00:38,491 --> 01:00:40,686
I thought you'd get me
Out of this mess.

623
01:00:40,793 --> 01:00:42,727
What more can i say?

624
01:00:42,828 --> 01:00:44,625
How much has she
Really told you?

625
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:48,530
If you want to know what fiona calls
"her little trade secrets", ask her.

626
01:00:48,634 --> 01:00:51,125
I don't believe she's
Told you a damn thing.

627
01:00:51,237 --> 01:00:53,228
There it is.

628
01:00:53,339 --> 01:00:55,364
Well, the problem is...

629
01:00:55,474 --> 01:00:58,671
Fiona thinks you don't
Like her enough.

630
01:01:05,351 --> 01:01:08,286
I just don't understand.

631
01:01:08,387 --> 01:01:11,322
I can't believe it.

632
01:01:11,424 --> 01:01:14,552
She couldn't confide
In you like that.

633
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:17,857
Manhood rebels in infidelity.

634
01:01:17,963 --> 01:01:20,090
It's only natural.

635
01:01:20,199 --> 01:01:23,657
Well, i would not consider
Fiona unfaithful to me...

636
01:01:23,769 --> 01:01:25,896
Were you and she to...

637
01:01:26,005 --> 01:01:28,200
Taste the love lunch.

638
01:01:28,307 --> 01:01:31,174
Why should i? Hm?

639
01:01:32,945 --> 01:01:35,846
She says
She loves you best.

640
01:01:37,249 --> 01:01:40,844
She doesn't love me best.
She couldn't.

641
01:01:42,855 --> 01:01:46,951
Hugh, why do you put
Yourself through this?

642
01:01:47,059 --> 01:01:50,187
Why not just let
Love take its course?

643
01:01:50,296 --> 01:01:52,287
It's the only thing
To do, isn't it?

644
01:02:11,183 --> 01:02:12,514
Do me a favor.

645
01:02:18,724 --> 01:02:21,557
Don't tell her about this...

646
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:24,094
Talk of ours.

647
01:02:24,196 --> 01:02:27,222
Fiona?

648
01:02:27,333 --> 01:02:28,561
No.

649
01:02:28,667 --> 01:02:30,032
Of course not.

650
01:02:33,205 --> 01:02:34,536
By the way,

651
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,837
I won't tell
Catherine either, okay?

652
01:02:58,130 --> 01:03:01,031
Hey! Come on!

653
01:03:01,133 --> 01:03:04,193
- What's the rush, hugh?
- Come on!

654
01:03:04,303 --> 01:03:06,498
He wants
To show us something.

655
01:03:06,605 --> 01:03:08,505
Oh, god.

656
01:03:08,607 --> 01:03:10,302
Wait for me, hugh!

657
01:03:16,382 --> 01:03:18,680
Can we all
Stick together?

658
01:03:18,784 --> 01:03:23,312
Pity we can't share hugh's boyish
Enthusiasm for self-imprisonment.

659
01:03:23,422 --> 01:03:26,084
I love these
Old masculine places.

660
01:03:26,192 --> 01:03:27,682
You know i do.

661
01:03:32,831 --> 01:03:36,426
Look! Burned.
Burned clean.

662
01:03:36,535 --> 01:03:39,245
No juice of the growing fruit,
That's for sure.

663
01:03:39,305 --> 01:03:41,739
Don't be cryptic,
Baby, please.

664
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:45,401
Can't even smell it, fella.
No smoke, no ashes. Nothing.

665
01:03:45,511 --> 01:03:48,207
It's like the reflection
Of some fiery nightmare.

666
01:03:49,181 --> 01:03:50,580
Sure...

667
01:03:50,581 --> 01:03:52,984
If that's what you want.
Personally, i prefer something

668
01:03:52,985 --> 01:03:55,476
A little more than weeds
And discoloration.

669
01:03:55,588 --> 01:03:58,751
- How about you, catherine?
- Oh, cyril, stop arguing.

670
01:04:02,761 --> 01:04:04,456
Upstairs, now,
Is it?

671
01:04:05,397 --> 01:04:06,447
No.

672
01:04:07,433 --> 01:04:08,491
The dungeons.

673
01:04:09,401 --> 01:04:10,451
Come on...

674
01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:14,037
- i smell pee.
- Me, too.

675
01:04:15,241 --> 01:04:18,301
I thought you loved these
Masculine places, fiona?

676
01:04:20,212 --> 01:04:22,742
If there's nothing
Down there, what then?

677
01:04:22,748 --> 01:04:25,182
Oh, it's here,
All right.

678
01:04:25,284 --> 01:04:26,478
I dreamt it.

679
01:04:26,479 --> 01:04:28,386
Stop him. Can't you
Do something?

680
01:04:28,387 --> 01:04:30,722
It's too late. Besides, he seems
To be enjoying himself.

681
01:04:30,723 --> 01:04:34,682
- Why can't we hold hands?
- Hugh, tell us the dream.

682
01:04:34,793 --> 01:04:37,193
Can't we just climb back up
And go for a swim?

683
01:04:37,194 --> 01:04:41,432
Don't you want to go
Swimming with me, baby?

684
01:04:41,433 --> 01:04:44,602
Of course he does, but hugh's
Not about to change his mind.

685
01:04:44,603 --> 01:04:46,938
He'll deny us the same way
He denies the children.

686
01:04:46,939 --> 01:04:50,074
Hugh, we can't have a little
Hugging and kissing down there.

687
01:04:50,075 --> 01:04:53,010
- Can't you see?
- He doesn't care.

688
01:04:55,114 --> 01:04:56,638
Cyril, help me.

689
01:04:56,749 --> 01:04:58,740
Tell hugh i always
Mean what i say.

690
01:05:02,154 --> 01:05:05,351
I wish they would wait.
I wish they would just wait.

691
01:05:05,457 --> 01:05:06,507
Hugh is in a hurry.

692
01:05:06,558 --> 01:05:07,752
Owww!

693
01:05:08,661 --> 01:05:09,992
What's that?

694
01:05:09,993 --> 01:05:13,531
You better come down here,
Your wife's in trouble.

695
01:05:13,532 --> 01:05:14,658
Oh, god.

696
01:05:17,202 --> 01:05:18,252
Fiona?

697
01:05:19,071 --> 01:05:20,121
What happened?

698
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,635
- Are you all right?
- I slipped, baby.

699
01:05:23,742 --> 01:05:26,074
Me... I fell.

700
01:05:26,178 --> 01:05:27,839
Stand up, see if
You can walk.

701
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:30,682
I hope you're satisfied, hugh.
Fiona might have broken her ankle.

702
01:05:30,683 --> 01:05:33,846
- She just slipped.
- Here, put this sweater on.

703
01:05:33,952 --> 01:05:35,920
- We have to go.
- She'll be all right.

704
01:05:36,021 --> 01:05:37,682
There's no way out.

705
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:39,052
We're at the bottom.

706
01:05:39,158 --> 01:05:42,321
Buried, you mean?
Buried alive?

707
01:05:42,428 --> 01:05:44,225
- How's it feel?
- All right.

708
01:05:50,102 --> 01:05:51,967
Here we are.

709
01:05:57,309 --> 01:05:59,072
Come see how
You like it, fella.

710
01:06:05,191 --> 01:06:09,954
If i were you, i'd leave
That thing where i found it.

711
01:06:09,955 --> 01:06:11,354
That's my advice.

712
01:06:11,355 --> 01:06:13,958
I don't want to know
What it is. I don't want to see it.

713
01:06:13,959 --> 01:06:16,325
Old cyril knows what it is.
Don't you, fella?

714
01:06:16,326 --> 01:06:18,029
- Yes, i do.
- Tell us, baby. Tell us.

715
01:06:18,030 --> 01:06:19,691
No, fiona,
It's up to hugh.

716
01:06:19,798 --> 01:06:21,698
Damn right, it is.

717
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:24,268
Hugh, it's a bad omen,
Leave it behind.

718
01:06:24,370 --> 01:06:26,930
My god, fella, where's
Your sense of humor?

719
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:28,768
I knew it was there,
It had to be.

720
01:06:28,874 --> 01:06:31,069
Okay, so you found it,
Now put it back.

721
01:06:31,176 --> 01:06:32,609
Not a chance.

722
01:06:34,113 --> 01:06:36,581
Not a chance.

723
01:06:44,056 --> 01:06:46,923
Is that all?
Doesn't look like much.

724
01:06:47,025 --> 01:06:49,195
Take a better look,
It'll change your mind.

725
01:06:57,269 --> 01:06:59,863
Oh, no!

726
01:07:02,207 --> 01:07:03,902
It looks like a belt.

727
01:07:05,778 --> 01:07:07,712
What are all
Those little teeth?

728
01:07:12,584 --> 01:07:14,518
You put it there,
Didn't you, hugh?

729
01:07:14,653 --> 01:07:16,382
You planned it!

730
01:07:16,383 --> 01:07:18,756
Don't be afraid, pick it up.
Show us how it works.

731
01:07:18,757 --> 01:07:20,281
Cyril, let's go.

732
01:07:20,282 --> 01:07:22,727
The only trouble is we've only
One of these, instead of two.

733
01:07:22,728 --> 01:07:24,429
Shut up, hugh, for god's sake!

734
01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:27,558
Or maybe one's enough.
What do you think?

735
01:07:34,139 --> 01:07:37,666
Do you want me
To try it on for you?

736
01:07:37,776 --> 01:07:40,210
Is that what you want?

737
01:07:51,223 --> 01:07:54,920
Beneath every footfall of
Our daily procession through town...

738
01:07:55,027 --> 01:07:56,892
Other footsteps echo.

739
01:07:56,995 --> 01:07:59,725
Yours, fiona,
And hugh's as well.

740
01:08:01,567 --> 01:08:05,901
My hope is the mantra
Of familiar places and memories

741
01:08:06,004 --> 01:08:10,566
Will finally draw catherine out of her
Mute state and revive her.

742
01:08:38,103 --> 01:08:39,153
Oh!

743
01:08:55,687 --> 01:08:57,848
You're wearing
Your nice old robe.

744
01:09:00,292 --> 01:09:01,589
Have fun, baby.

745
01:09:07,399 --> 01:09:10,300
I could stay here tonight,
If you prefer.

746
01:09:10,402 --> 01:09:12,131
What do you think?

747
01:09:12,237 --> 01:09:14,603
You're feeling amorous...

748
01:09:14,706 --> 01:09:16,640
And she's expecting you,
I can tell.

749
01:09:18,944 --> 01:09:21,640
This blue mood
Is not like you, fiona.

750
01:09:22,814 --> 01:09:25,749
I'll stay. No, baby.

751
01:09:27,286 --> 01:09:28,344
Go ahead.

752
01:09:28,987 --> 01:09:30,147
Please?

753
01:09:31,256 --> 01:09:32,416
All right.

754
01:09:33,859 --> 01:09:38,296
- I won't be long.
- Don't hurry, baby.

755
01:09:38,397 --> 01:09:39,625
I'm gonna read.

756
01:09:45,437 --> 01:09:46,927
Listen...

757
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:48,700
If hugh does show up...

758
01:09:50,642 --> 01:09:52,667
He's at the studio.

759
01:09:52,778 --> 01:09:55,212
I told you,
I'm gonna read.

760
01:09:59,251 --> 01:10:01,685
It's just never
Gonna happen, baby.

761
01:10:01,787 --> 01:10:03,345
I was wrong.

762
01:10:08,193 --> 01:10:10,024
You'd better go.

763
01:10:12,965 --> 01:10:15,160
Come back when you want.

764
01:10:30,215 --> 01:10:32,274
Catherine, what's the matter?

765
01:10:32,384 --> 01:10:34,074
What's happened,
What's wrong?

766
01:10:37,456 --> 01:10:40,826
Something you want me to know,
But you don't want to say? What is it?

767
01:10:43,762 --> 01:10:46,492
Fiona's not herself tonight...

768
01:10:46,598 --> 01:10:48,828
...neither are you.
- I wish you hadn't come.

769
01:10:48,934 --> 01:10:51,764
- But you've been expecting me.
- Yes, but you'd better go.

770
01:10:52,704 --> 01:10:55,935
- Is it hugh?
- It's not hugh.

771
01:10:56,041 --> 01:10:58,339
- Tell me, what's he done?
- Nothing.

772
01:11:00,379 --> 01:11:02,404
Catherine...

773
01:11:02,405 --> 01:11:03,981
Put your arms
On my shoulders,

774
01:11:03,982 --> 01:11:06,280
Your hands in my hair,
And kiss me.

775
01:11:06,385 --> 01:11:07,977
I can't, i just can't.

776
01:11:07,978 --> 01:11:10,821
Well, i'm not going
To leave you like this.

777
01:11:10,822 --> 01:11:13,112
- You know i'm not.
- That's what i want you to do.

778
01:11:26,738 --> 01:11:29,172
Join me, catherine.

779
01:11:29,274 --> 01:11:31,606
You may as well.

780
01:11:46,458 --> 01:11:49,188
Confide in me.
What else can you do?

781
01:11:57,169 --> 01:11:59,694
Stop. I wish you'd stop.

782
01:12:00,739 --> 01:12:01,967
What?

783
01:12:04,176 --> 01:12:05,226
No.

784
01:12:09,247 --> 01:12:11,477
- It can't be true.
- I didn't want you to know.

785
01:12:13,552 --> 01:12:14,917
Oh!

786
01:12:20,192 --> 01:12:23,161
How could he do this,
How could you let him?

787
01:12:23,261 --> 01:12:26,196
He made me.
That's all.

788
01:12:29,935 --> 01:12:32,885
All night long, you've been
Wearing this wretched thing?

789
01:12:51,156 --> 01:12:53,147
- What are you doing?
- Never mind.

790
01:12:56,094 --> 01:12:58,119
I won't be long.

791
01:12:59,197 --> 01:13:00,892
Trust me.

792
01:13:08,707 --> 01:13:10,470
Hugh?

793
01:13:19,184 --> 01:13:20,742
Hugh?

794
01:13:23,722 --> 01:13:25,815
Is that you, fella?

795
01:13:30,228 --> 01:13:33,527
- You know it is.
- Come, i want to talk to you.

796
01:13:34,366 --> 01:13:37,233
Why don't you smoke?
It'll be easier.

797
01:13:40,405 --> 01:13:42,965
Did she say anything...

798
01:13:43,074 --> 01:13:45,634
Or did she throw you out,
Like i told her to?

799
01:13:45,635 --> 01:13:49,780
I got your message, hugh,
If that's what you mean.

800
01:13:49,781 --> 01:13:52,113
You got my message.

801
01:13:55,253 --> 01:13:57,243
Well, it must have come
As quite a shock.

802
01:13:59,257 --> 01:14:01,589
Don't you know
What you've done?

803
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:03,794
I know you've been
Sucking two eggs at once.

804
01:14:03,795 --> 01:14:05,228
That's what i know.

805
01:14:05,330 --> 01:14:07,821
But it's over, it's finished.

806
01:14:07,933 --> 01:14:10,463
You haven't felt
This way before, why now?

807
01:14:16,441 --> 01:14:18,033
I didn't know before.

808
01:14:22,547 --> 01:14:25,482
Call me slow, fella.
Slow.

809
01:14:25,617 --> 01:14:27,380
But now, i know.

810
01:14:29,287 --> 01:14:30,948
So, tonight's your night?

811
01:14:36,661 --> 01:14:38,411
Planned it all
Beforehand, fella.

812
01:14:39,764 --> 01:14:41,891
And you fell right into it.

813
01:14:41,892 --> 01:14:44,969
I guess you just walked in there and
Told my wife to strip down as usual.

814
01:14:44,970 --> 01:14:48,462
And then found there's one easy way
To stop that sort of thing.

815
01:14:48,573 --> 01:14:50,939
I made it pretty plain,
The lid's on the jar.

816
01:14:51,042 --> 01:14:52,092
It's all over.

817
01:14:52,878 --> 01:14:54,311
Have you finished?

818
01:14:56,448 --> 01:14:59,315
My room, my bed...

819
01:14:59,417 --> 01:15:00,907
My wife.

820
01:15:01,019 --> 01:15:03,078
With the children
In the next room.

821
01:15:03,188 --> 01:15:05,850
And you naked, crawling
All over my marriage.

822
01:15:06,431 --> 01:15:10,828
She took off her clothes,
She lay on her back...

823
01:15:10,829 --> 01:15:13,024
She tongued you.
You've tongued her.

824
01:15:13,025 --> 01:15:16,066
With meredith there
In the next room.

825
01:15:16,067 --> 01:15:18,194
Let me tell you
Something, fella.

826
01:15:18,303 --> 01:15:21,466
You deserve that belt.
The both of you.

827
01:15:25,977 --> 01:15:28,002
At least it's ingenious.

828
01:15:28,113 --> 01:15:31,105
You've gotta admit,
It's pretty ingenious.

829
01:15:31,216 --> 01:15:32,774
Hugh, come out.

830
01:15:33,752 --> 01:15:36,346
Hugh, for the last time,
Come out here.

831
01:15:41,493 --> 01:15:43,427
You think i'm afraid
Of last resorts?

832
01:15:44,963 --> 01:15:47,973
I thought that damn thing was going
To come apart in my hands.

833
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:50,062
But it fit, it worked.

834
01:15:50,168 --> 01:15:53,358
I found my own way to deal with
The problem and you can't fight it.

835
01:15:54,706 --> 01:15:57,231
I'm crafty, fella, crafty.

836
01:15:57,342 --> 01:16:00,004
And that damn belt's
A work of art.

837
01:16:00,005 --> 01:16:01,845
If catherine and fiona
Could see us now,

838
01:16:01,846 --> 01:16:04,316
What would they think, hm?
How should they feel?

839
01:16:04,349 --> 01:16:07,409
How should they feel?
What about me? I'm the victim.

840
01:16:07,519 --> 01:16:10,044
You, the victim?
Who's the culprit?

841
01:16:10,155 --> 01:16:12,555
Me? Catherine? Fiona?

842
01:16:12,657 --> 01:16:14,989
You're to blame.
By god, you're to blame.

843
01:16:15,093 --> 01:16:17,357
Oh no, i'm not.

844
01:16:17,462 --> 01:16:21,364
Since catherine isn't using me
To revenge herself on you,

845
01:16:21,499 --> 01:16:25,060
And i'm not having sex with catherine
For malicious reasons of my own...

846
01:16:25,170 --> 01:16:29,266
Your defeat, chagrin, antagonism,
Whatever it is you feel...

847
01:16:29,267 --> 01:16:31,141
Is your responsibility,
And not mine.

848
01:16:31,142 --> 01:16:33,133
Anguish!
Just anguish.

849
01:16:33,244 --> 01:16:36,509
That's what i feel. The point
Of the pike in the scrotum.

850
01:16:36,614 --> 01:16:39,708
You just need a little
Reassurance, hugh, that's all.

851
01:16:39,818 --> 01:16:43,219
Take my wife and
Give me reassurance?

852
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:47,358
You want me to leave,
Just let you have her?

853
01:16:47,359 --> 01:16:50,761
Be gone with the dawn,
Just disappear? That would suit you, wouldn't it?

854
01:16:50,762 --> 01:16:52,525
No, no, it wouldn't.

855
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:55,463
If you leave now,
You'd be deserting catherine.

856
01:16:55,567 --> 01:16:57,296
The children would suffer.

857
01:16:57,297 --> 01:16:59,203
Fiona would just send
Me out to bring you back.

858
01:16:59,204 --> 01:17:01,035
That's not a good idea.

859
01:17:01,139 --> 01:17:03,869
So i don't count?
Don't count at all?

860
01:17:03,975 --> 01:17:05,567
No, hugh,
I'm not saying that.

861
01:17:07,979 --> 01:17:09,844
Let's look at the other options.

862
01:17:10,348 --> 01:17:12,976
The belt...

863
01:17:13,084 --> 01:17:14,517
That's an option.

864
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:19,916
Choose the belt and your own
Sex life would be destroyed.

865
01:17:20,025 --> 01:17:22,152
Catherine would despise you.

866
01:17:22,153 --> 01:17:24,795
The children would side with
Their mother, they always do.

867
01:17:24,796 --> 01:17:27,458
You'd be hated and
Isolated by them all.

868
01:17:27,459 --> 01:17:29,400
Fiona wouldn't be able
To bear the sight of you.

869
01:17:29,401 --> 01:17:33,394
And all because you can't
Condone catherine and me?

870
01:17:33,505 --> 01:17:37,407
You've got your manhood.
Let me have mine.

871
01:17:37,542 --> 01:17:40,033
Manhood? All right,
Let's talk about manhood.

872
01:17:40,145 --> 01:17:43,395
Do you think i'd treat fiona
The way you're treating catherine?

873
01:17:45,417 --> 01:17:47,467
What does catherine
See in you, anyway?

874
01:17:47,485 --> 01:17:50,045
What does fiona see in you?

875
01:17:50,655 --> 01:17:52,384
God knows.

876
01:18:04,636 --> 01:18:07,264
I'm not worth it, fella.
Not worth it.

877
01:18:10,575 --> 01:18:13,045
Well, fiona feels
Otherwise, that's all.

878
01:18:16,081 --> 01:18:17,708
Maybe i'm too idealistic.

879
01:18:20,351 --> 01:18:22,478
Fiona's idealistic, too.

880
01:18:24,556 --> 01:18:26,786
She's just as idealistic
As you are.

881
01:18:36,901 --> 01:18:40,098
But her idealism
Is not prohibitive.

882
01:18:40,205 --> 01:18:43,504
It doesn't preclude sexual
Affection. It begins with it.

883
01:18:43,608 --> 01:18:45,439
That's the difference.

884
01:18:50,148 --> 01:18:53,276
Everything fiona feels
For you is genuine.

885
01:18:53,384 --> 01:18:55,314
She has a lot more
To regret than you do.

886
01:18:57,589 --> 01:19:01,787
I'm depriving myself of the wife
Of a man who's taken mine.

887
01:19:01,893 --> 01:19:03,523
That's plenty to regret.
Plenty.

888
01:19:03,621 --> 01:19:07,364
If you can benefit
From this discussion,

889
01:19:07,365 --> 01:19:11,028
All four of us will be better off.
I won't deny that.

890
01:19:11,029 --> 01:19:13,103
On the other hand, if you can't
Learn anything from this...

891
01:19:13,104 --> 01:19:14,662
Then naturally your...

892
01:19:14,663 --> 01:19:17,341
Dissatisfaction's going
To rub off on the rest of us.

893
01:19:17,342 --> 01:19:19,276
I won't deny that either.

894
01:19:21,713 --> 01:19:23,738
Harmony...

895
01:19:23,848 --> 01:19:26,510
Is something all four
Of us can enjoy.

896
01:19:28,186 --> 01:19:31,678
I'd like to see fiona happy.
But that's your affair.

897
01:19:31,789 --> 01:19:34,417
Catherine's fondness
For me is hers.

898
01:19:34,526 --> 01:19:37,017
It can't be changed.

899
01:19:37,128 --> 01:19:38,328
There's always the belt.

900
01:19:40,765 --> 01:19:44,462
There's always that
Damn chastity belt.

901
01:19:44,569 --> 01:19:46,979
Don't worry about the belt,
I'll deal with that.

902
01:19:50,475 --> 01:19:53,005
Is there anything you want me
To say to catherine?

903
01:20:08,226 --> 01:20:11,787
- Where have you been?
- With hugh.

904
01:20:11,896 --> 01:20:14,023
He hates the whole thing.

905
01:20:14,132 --> 01:20:18,330
I talked to him,
It's not so bad.

906
01:20:18,436 --> 01:20:19,869
We can't go on.

907
01:20:20,004 --> 01:20:24,668
He's come around.
He's probably with fiona right now.

908
01:20:24,776 --> 01:20:27,836
I've hurt hugh
As much as he's hurt me.

909
01:20:27,946 --> 01:20:30,346
I can't face it
Any longer.

910
01:20:30,448 --> 01:20:34,976
You can forgive hugh for
What he did. And so can i.

911
01:20:35,086 --> 01:20:37,919
It's over.
That's all i can say.

912
01:20:39,824 --> 01:20:43,419
Catherine, you know why i spoke
To hugh, you know why i'm here.

913
01:20:46,764 --> 01:20:49,324
Don't touch me,
Don't ask me to move.

914
01:20:50,301 --> 01:20:52,633
Catherine, i want you
To stand up.

915
01:20:54,105 --> 01:20:57,871
Hugh made me put this on.

916
01:20:57,976 --> 01:21:00,945
He'll have to tell me
To take it off.

917
01:21:01,045 --> 01:21:03,809
I'm speaking for hugh.

918
01:21:03,915 --> 01:21:06,543
For his good,
And yours and mine.

919
01:21:08,052 --> 01:21:11,783
Now please, stand up.

920
01:21:11,889 --> 01:21:13,220
You'll feel better.

921
01:21:14,325 --> 01:21:15,986
Come on.

922
01:21:31,709 --> 01:21:33,040
Stand still.

923
01:22:04,242 --> 01:22:06,210
That's one.

924
01:23:04,135 --> 01:23:06,603
Do you still
Want me to leave?

925
01:23:08,139 --> 01:23:10,266
It's up to you.

926
01:23:10,375 --> 01:23:13,344
Kiss me, cyril.

927
01:23:13,444 --> 01:23:14,638
Kiss me.

928
01:23:54,152 --> 01:23:55,676
I miss them.

929
01:23:59,023 --> 01:24:01,958
I miss rosella's lovers.

930
01:24:02,093 --> 01:24:06,325
They don't come anymore.
They've given up, i suppose.

931
01:24:07,999 --> 01:24:10,331
Fiona would never
Have let them go.

932
01:24:10,435 --> 01:24:13,097
Of course, rosella
Had to let them go.

933
01:24:14,238 --> 01:24:16,604
She's already
Spoken for.

934
01:24:19,877 --> 01:24:22,607
Rosella was hugh's
Last peasant nude.

935
01:24:24,248 --> 01:24:26,682
Never laid a finger on her.
He didn't need to.

936
01:24:28,753 --> 01:24:30,744
He had his photographs.

937
01:24:32,690 --> 01:24:34,453
His art.

938
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:39,220
Catherine, did you know
About hugh?

939
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:40,729
About what he was doing?

940
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:43,130
- Did you...
- don't ask. I don't know.

941
01:24:47,972 --> 01:24:51,305
Why didn't you
Say something? Hmm?

942
01:24:58,316 --> 01:25:01,046
Catherine,
It wasn't your fault.

943
01:25:01,152 --> 01:25:03,313
If it was anybody's,
It was mine.

944
01:25:08,359 --> 01:25:10,589
But then really
It wasn't mine, either.

945
01:25:13,097 --> 01:25:16,658
Hugh's agony had nothing
To do with any of us.

946
01:25:16,767 --> 01:25:19,395
What he was doing
In his studio was a private thing.

947
01:25:19,504 --> 01:25:22,132
A private perversion.

948
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:23,870
But he won in the end,
Didn't he?

949
01:25:23,908 --> 01:25:26,172
No, no, he didn't.

950
01:25:26,277 --> 01:25:28,211
He poisoned all of us.

951
01:25:30,381 --> 01:25:31,780
But we will recover.

952
01:25:37,221 --> 01:25:40,418
I miss my children.

953
01:26:07,919 --> 01:26:10,114
The children will
Be awake soon.

954
01:26:11,622 --> 01:26:12,672
I'll leave now.

955
01:26:14,458 --> 01:26:16,426
Yes, you should.

956
01:26:55,399 --> 01:26:56,449
To us.

957
01:26:57,835 --> 01:26:59,564
- To all of us.
- To us.

958
01:27:00,905 --> 01:27:04,397
- Speech baby, speech.
- Speak to us, cyril.

959
01:27:04,508 --> 01:27:07,409
You're the sex singer.
Voice of us all.

960
01:27:08,913 --> 01:27:10,847
Well, there's always monogamy.

961
01:27:10,948 --> 01:27:13,348
What a ugly word!

962
01:27:13,451 --> 01:27:15,510
We can trust cyril, catherine.

963
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:17,247
We can trust ourselves.

964
01:27:18,322 --> 01:27:21,086
Talk on, cyril.

965
01:27:21,192 --> 01:27:24,525
The only real enemy to
The mature marriage is monogamy.

966
01:27:25,029 --> 01:27:28,260
Anything less than sexual
Multiplicity is naive.

967
01:27:29,533 --> 01:27:31,467
What are we, if not...

968
01:27:31,602 --> 01:27:34,537
Sexual idlers
In a vast wood?

969
01:27:34,672 --> 01:27:38,540
What is marriage, if not
That wood in which we wander?

970
01:27:38,643 --> 01:27:40,406
The cynics
Are against us, cyril.

971
01:27:40,511 --> 01:27:41,808
You know that.

972
01:27:41,912 --> 01:27:44,346
None of them has tasted
The love-lunch.

973
01:27:44,448 --> 01:27:47,144
None of them know about
The sexual properties

974
01:27:47,251 --> 01:27:50,778
Of our golden wheels
Of ripe cheese.

975
01:27:50,779 --> 01:27:53,390
Old detractors should curb
Their judgments of a man

976
01:27:53,391 --> 01:27:55,825
Who knows what
He's talking about.

977
01:27:55,926 --> 01:27:58,451
To young detractors,
I will say only this.

978
01:27:58,562 --> 01:28:00,860
If orgasm is the pit
Of the fruit...

979
01:28:00,965 --> 01:28:02,830
Then lyricism
Is its flesh.

980
01:28:04,502 --> 01:28:07,835
Marriage is the fold
That gathers in all lovers...

981
01:28:07,938 --> 01:28:10,065
Naked and alone.

982
01:28:10,174 --> 01:28:13,109
Oh, it's beautiful, baby,
It really is.

983
01:28:23,988 --> 01:28:25,038
Catherine?

984
01:28:26,891 --> 01:28:29,359
Catherine,
Look what i've got.

985
01:28:44,709 --> 01:28:46,639
You ready to see them yet,
Catherine?

986
01:28:47,712 --> 01:28:48,804
I don't know.

987
01:28:50,481 --> 01:28:52,278
I want to see them
So badly, but i...

988
01:28:52,383 --> 01:28:53,714
Don't know if i can yet.

989
01:28:56,353 --> 01:28:57,843
Soon.

990
01:29:10,367 --> 01:29:12,062
Cyril...

991
01:29:12,169 --> 01:29:14,694
- he's not there.
- What?

992
01:29:14,805 --> 01:29:16,773
I mean it, baby.
He's gone.

993
01:29:18,442 --> 01:29:19,966
Catherine, too?

994
01:29:20,077 --> 01:29:23,240
No, she's still asleep,
But he's not with her.

995
01:29:23,347 --> 01:29:25,397
He's just not there,
He is just not there.

996
01:29:25,483 --> 01:29:26,933
Look around,
He can't be far.

997
01:29:27,017 --> 01:29:29,850
I already looked for him.
Everywhere.

998
01:29:29,851 --> 01:29:33,156
Cyril, i know
Something's wrong.

999
01:29:33,157 --> 01:29:34,390
How do you know
Something's wrong?

1000
01:29:34,391 --> 01:29:38,350
Well, i just know.
Premonition. I know.

1001
01:29:38,496 --> 01:29:40,691
Come back to bed
For awhile. Come on.

1002
01:29:40,798 --> 01:29:42,663
All right baby,
I'll go alone.

1003
01:29:48,405 --> 01:29:49,455
Fiona?

1004
01:30:03,287 --> 01:30:04,618
Fiona, wait!

1005
01:30:16,834 --> 01:30:18,131
- Fiona...
- hugh!

1006
01:30:18,235 --> 01:30:20,396
- I think you should wait.
- I'm here!

1007
01:30:31,649 --> 01:30:33,583
Help me, cyril!

1008
01:30:44,728 --> 01:30:45,778
Hugh...?

1009
01:30:46,931 --> 01:30:50,025
Lift him up,
Lift him.

1010
01:30:50,134 --> 01:30:51,965
Get it off!

1011
01:31:18,662 --> 01:31:20,061
It's no good.

1012
01:31:31,609 --> 01:31:34,669
Did you know
He was doing this?

1013
01:31:34,778 --> 01:31:36,939
Did you have
Any idea?

1014
01:31:37,047 --> 01:31:40,016
No, i didn't. If i had
I would have told you.

1015
01:31:40,264 --> 01:31:45,722
This is what he was doing
When he came here alone at night?

1016
01:31:45,723 --> 01:31:50,888
Here, in this room, with a noose
And the photographs of these...

1017
01:31:50,995 --> 01:31:53,395
Poor peasant girls?

1018
01:31:54,632 --> 01:31:57,965
My god, was this
What he wanted?

1019
01:31:58,068 --> 01:32:00,696
Orgasm with a noose
And a photograph?

1020
01:32:07,678 --> 01:32:10,511
I thought we were
In illyria, baby.

1021
01:32:12,983 --> 01:32:15,315
I guess i was wrong.

1022
01:32:15,419 --> 01:32:16,852
We are in illyria.

1023
01:32:41,512 --> 01:32:43,980
I'm going to...

1024
01:32:44,114 --> 01:32:46,082
I'm going to go to catherine.

1025
01:32:46,216 --> 01:32:47,774
You can do the rest.

1026
01:33:29,293 --> 01:33:30,624
Catherine!

1027
01:33:40,504 --> 01:33:41,554
Mommy?

1028
01:33:44,408 --> 01:33:45,458
Mommy?

1029
01:33:48,779 --> 01:33:51,111
Mommy, it's me.

1030
01:34:06,764 --> 01:34:08,254
They're asleep.

1031
01:34:15,139 --> 01:34:17,369
We both know
What we must do.

1032
01:34:21,378 --> 01:34:23,573
I'll take them home,

1033
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:26,410
And when she's better
I'll bring them back.

1034
01:34:26,517 --> 01:34:30,283
- Home, you want to go home?
- Cyril, we have no choice.

1035
01:34:30,387 --> 01:34:32,218
This place is poison for them.

1036
01:34:34,892 --> 01:34:37,986
Obviously, catherine
Can't look after them.

1037
01:34:38,095 --> 01:34:40,029
So who else
Is there but me?

1038
01:34:40,731 --> 01:34:43,427
I have to go.

1039
01:34:43,534 --> 01:34:44,967
You know that.

1040
01:34:48,672 --> 01:34:51,266
It won't be forever, baby.

1041
01:34:52,209 --> 01:34:54,803
You'll tell her that
When she's ready.

1042
01:34:54,912 --> 01:34:56,641
I'll tell her.

1043
01:34:58,148 --> 01:35:00,082
Fiona, i don't
Want you to go.

1044
01:35:01,118 --> 01:35:03,177
I must,
For catherine's sake.

1045
01:35:06,623 --> 01:35:08,887
Do you think...

1046
01:35:08,992 --> 01:35:11,893
She'll blame us for hugh?

1047
01:35:11,995 --> 01:35:13,622
I'll explain it.

1048
01:35:13,730 --> 01:35:16,460
How?

1049
01:35:16,567 --> 01:35:17,898
I don't know which is worse...

1050
01:35:18,001 --> 01:35:20,526
A suicide, or a accident
Of hugh's sort.

1051
01:35:22,473 --> 01:35:24,441
She will think
We're responsible.

1052
01:35:24,575 --> 01:35:26,338
- She'll hate us.
- No, she won't.

1053
01:35:26,443 --> 01:35:30,277
- What will you tell her?
- I'll tell her the truth,

1054
01:35:30,380 --> 01:35:32,940
That although hugh
Was finally able to join us,

1055
01:35:33,050 --> 01:35:35,575
He couldn't resist
His secret pleasures.

1056
01:35:37,788 --> 01:35:42,521
Fiona, it could
Have happened at any time.

1057
01:35:42,626 --> 01:35:45,390
Before we met them,
During our time together...

1058
01:35:45,496 --> 01:35:47,623
Even after we'd
Gone our separate ways.

1059
01:35:50,934 --> 01:35:52,401
Poor catherine.

1060
01:35:54,571 --> 01:35:56,471
Be good to her, baby.

1061
01:35:58,108 --> 01:35:59,769
Be good to her.

1062
01:36:00,878 --> 01:36:03,244
As good as i've been to you.
That enough?

1063
01:36:06,917 --> 01:36:09,977
Don't bother
Being a husband, baby.

1064
01:36:11,355 --> 01:36:14,916
- Be a sex-singer.
- Oh.

1065
01:36:16,527 --> 01:36:18,552
Remember when i said that?

1066
01:36:20,430 --> 01:36:21,920
I remember.

1067
01:38:27,030 --> 01:38:31,994
Take the glass, he just
Wants you to toast his boat.

1068
01:38:31,995 --> 01:38:33,257
It's all right.

1069
01:38:44,274 --> 01:38:45,324
Ahh!

1070
01:39:28,251 --> 01:39:30,481
What does this
Remind you of?

1071
01:39:30,587 --> 01:39:32,748
I'm not sure,
Tell me.

1072
01:39:32,856 --> 01:39:34,847
How about
The day we met?

1073
01:39:37,561 --> 01:39:39,825
Does it remind you
Of a wedding?

1074
01:39:41,231 --> 01:39:43,290
A birth,
More like it.

1075
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:46,699
Same thing.
It's the same thing.

1076
01:41:21,298 --> 01:41:24,961
One day soon, catherine and i
Will walk into the town

1077
01:41:25,068 --> 01:41:28,003
To meet you and
The children off the bus.

1078
01:41:28,138 --> 01:41:33,303
At long last fiona,
We will resume our illyrian dream.

1079
01:41:33,410 --> 01:41:36,675
You, me, catherine...

1080
01:41:36,780 --> 01:41:39,214
And whoever else
Wants to join us.

1081
01:41:40,784 --> 01:41:44,185
The sun is an orange disk
Upon the sea...

1082
01:41:44,321 --> 01:41:46,414
Our nights are cool.

1083
01:41:46,523 --> 01:41:49,856
In illyria,
There are no seasons.
