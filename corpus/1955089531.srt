Synced and corrected by R3V0LV3R.

2
00:02:32,505 --> 00:02:35,974
This is the only photograph
I own from my childhood.

3
00:02:35,975 --> 00:02:39,079
It was taken in 1955,
when I was 8 years old,

4
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,847
by my father
with a borrowed camera,

5
00:02:42,183 --> 00:02:44,384
and it's the only thing
I have left from those days...

6
00:02:44,385 --> 00:02:46,218
Except for my memories.

7
00:02:49,724 --> 00:02:51,424
This is a true story.

8
00:02:51,443 --> 00:02:53,543
This really happened to me.

9
00:02:59,618 --> 00:03:00,918
By 1962,

10
00:03:01,287 --> 00:03:02,854
I was 15 years old.

11
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:05,023
I had 2 brothers and 3 sisters,

12
00:03:05,024 --> 00:03:06,657
no father, no money.

13
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:09,095
I was the man of the house,

14
00:03:09,096 --> 00:03:10,863
and my mother, well...

15
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:13,466
She was one of a kind.

16
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,547
Christ!
You out of your mind?

17
00:03:27,683 --> 00:03:29,718
What's the matter
with you, asshole?

18
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:31,419
All right, all right.

19
00:03:33,323 --> 00:03:34,924
What's the matter with you?

20
00:03:34,925 --> 00:03:36,692
What's the matter with you?

21
00:03:36,693 --> 00:03:38,194
Mr. Owens to the
office immediately!

22
00:03:38,195 --> 00:03:39,495
Mist... aah!

23
00:03:41,498 --> 00:03:44,268
Fucking asshole!
You clean it up yourself!

24
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:46,036
He's the one that started it!

25
00:03:46,037 --> 00:03:47,337
So did you!

26
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:49,671
- Come on.
- Back off! Back off!

27
00:03:50,074 --> 00:03:51,574
He grabbed my ass!

28
00:03:51,643 --> 00:03:52,943
OK, come on!

29
00:04:06,393 --> 00:04:08,994
Oh, come on,
this wasn't my fault!

30
00:04:08,995 --> 00:04:10,362
Owens scared me!

31
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:13,466
Look, I really need
this job, Mr. Nardin.

32
00:04:13,467 --> 00:04:15,268
You can't do this!
I got kids! Come on!

33
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:16,569
You're fired.

34
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,537
- I'm begging you, pl...
- you're fired!

35
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,965
I told you,
I'm going to get money.

36
00:04:41,966 --> 00:04:43,499
I don't have the money now, OK.

37
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,368
You'll get the money later.

38
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:46,735
I'll have all the money for you.

39
00:04:46,736 --> 00:04:48,103
Get off my back.

40
00:04:48,473 --> 00:04:50,373
Just lay off me on this,

41
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,076
or you won't get nothing, OK?

42
00:04:52,077 --> 00:04:53,710
Just get off my back.

43
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:55,679
I'm going to get
the money for you.

44
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,713
You'll get the money, man!

45
00:04:59,384 --> 00:05:00,684
Hi, kids.

46
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,820
Hi, mama.

47
00:05:01,821 --> 00:05:02,303
Hi, mama.

48
00:05:02,304 --> 00:05:03,604
Hi, mom.

49
00:05:04,273 --> 00:05:08,143
Faye, how about letting your
old ma sit in her chair?

50
00:05:08,144 --> 00:05:10,145
I don't feel so good, mama.

51
00:05:10,146 --> 00:05:11,913
No? How was the movie?

52
00:05:12,082 --> 00:05:13,649
Well, it was scary.

53
00:05:13,683 --> 00:05:15,585
Flying saucers and monsters.

54
00:05:15,586 --> 00:05:16,886
Annie cried.

55
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:18,955
- Did not!
- Did too!

56
00:05:18,956 --> 00:05:19,956
Did not!

57
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,157
Did too!

58
00:05:21,358 --> 00:05:21,857
Did not!

59
00:05:22,058 --> 00:05:22,625
Did too!

60
00:05:23,026 --> 00:05:24,026
- Did not!
- Did too!

61
00:05:24,027 --> 00:05:24,527
Did not!

62
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:25,930
You two, pipe down.

63
00:05:25,931 --> 00:05:27,131
Did not, did not!

64
00:05:27,132 --> 00:05:28,132
Did too.

65
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,633
Look, mama.

66
00:05:30,368 --> 00:05:31,668
Oh, isn't that pretty?

67
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:33,036
Isn't that mine?

68
00:05:33,305 --> 00:05:34,605
I don't know.

69
00:05:35,674 --> 00:05:38,441
Where'd you guys
get all this candy?

70
00:05:38,877 --> 00:05:40,979
I just gave you enough
money to go to the movies.

71
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,013
You took your own popcorn.

72
00:05:43,617 --> 00:05:44,917
Lynn?

73
00:05:45,385 --> 00:05:46,685
I don't know.

74
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:48,621
Faye?

75
00:05:48,822 --> 00:05:50,122
It wasn't me.

76
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,090
Murray.

77
00:06:00,268 --> 00:06:01,835
Pipe down, you two.

78
00:06:02,204 --> 00:06:04,237
You're giving me an ulcer.

79
00:06:06,174 --> 00:06:08,209
Mrs. Lacey?
Your husband home?

80
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,545
No he's not.
What's the beef this time?

81
00:06:10,546 --> 00:06:12,347
- Mama, I was just...
- You shut up.

82
00:06:12,348 --> 00:06:14,383
We had a complain from
the phone company.

83
00:06:14,384 --> 00:06:16,918
Your kid had a string of
their coin returns plugged.

84
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:20,456
That's what you collared him for?
Penny ante crap?

85
00:06:20,457 --> 00:06:23,176
There's real crime,
and you're busting kids

86
00:06:23,177 --> 00:06:25,445
for boosting nickels from the
goddamn phone company?

87
00:06:25,446 --> 00:06:27,281
- Tell 'em, ma.
- You, pipe down.

88
00:06:27,482 --> 00:06:28,949
I've had a rotten day,

89
00:06:29,073 --> 00:06:30,251
a really rotten day,

90
00:06:30,252 --> 00:06:32,692
and wouldn't be in the mood for this,
if it came with flowers.

91
00:06:32,716 --> 00:06:34,555
You keeping him
or throwing him back?

92
00:06:34,556 --> 00:06:36,291
He ain't worth the paperwork.

93
00:06:36,292 --> 00:06:38,059
Just take this as a warning

94
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,895
and keep your Dillinger
off the street.

95
00:06:39,896 --> 00:06:41,763
Watch the name calling
and get out.

96
00:06:41,764 --> 00:06:43,531
I take care of my own.

97
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,568
Do that, lady, 'cause next time

98
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:49,336
we might not be
in such a good mood.

99
00:06:50,174 --> 00:06:53,276
So the shoeshine business
has been good lately, huh?

100
00:06:53,277 --> 00:06:54,917
Been doing real good
on tips, you told me.

101
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:56,212
Well, I did get...

102
00:06:56,213 --> 00:06:57,713
who did you lie to?

103
00:06:57,714 --> 00:06:59,014
Your mother.

104
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:04,720
Go get your father's belt.

105
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:12,997
That night,

106
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,032
my mother made a decision.

107
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,837
She didn't bother asking us
what we wanted to do.

108
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:19,138
She never did.

109
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,874
And once mama made up her mind,

110
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,908
there was no stopping her.

111
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:30,767
I'm thirsty.

112
00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:37,642
Tomorrow morning we're moving
out of this toilet of a city.

113
00:07:37,643 --> 00:07:38,943
Huh?

114
00:07:39,245 --> 00:07:40,545
Don't "huh" me.

115
00:07:42,414 --> 00:07:44,548
We're going to find
a decent town to live in

116
00:07:44,549 --> 00:07:47,119
and a proper home,
a house of our own.

117
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,420
That's that.

118
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:53,292
I ain't leaving. I ain't
leaving the neighborhood.

119
00:07:53,293 --> 00:07:55,128
One more "ain't,"
I soap out that mouth.

120
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:57,496
You're going.
We're all going.

121
00:07:59,533 --> 00:08:01,566
I ain't...
I'm not going.

122
00:08:03,137 --> 00:08:05,037
We're leaving this city.

123
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,875
I don't have the chance
of an ice cube in a frying pan

124
00:08:07,876 --> 00:08:11,109
of making things better
as long as we stay.

125
00:08:12,715 --> 00:08:14,216
I'm sick of moving around.

126
00:08:14,217 --> 00:08:15,517
That's too bad.

127
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:17,920
You're the man of the house.

128
00:08:17,921 --> 00:08:20,455
Have you forgotten
the promise you made me?

129
00:08:20,456 --> 00:08:22,826
You swore you'd help me with
your brothers and sisters,

130
00:08:22,827 --> 00:08:25,394
that I could
always count on you.

131
00:08:25,395 --> 00:08:27,162
You gave me your word.

132
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,101
Yeah.

133
00:08:32,904 --> 00:08:34,804
I know it won't be easy,

134
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,789
but I can't do it
without you, Shayne.

135
00:08:38,492 --> 00:08:40,059
Now get some sleep.

136
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:51,138
I'll make you a promise.

137
00:08:52,408 --> 00:08:53,809
You do this for me,

138
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,910
and we'll never move again.

139
00:08:56,396 --> 00:08:57,696
Promise.

140
00:09:06,324 --> 00:09:07,624
So we left L.A.

141
00:09:07,858 --> 00:09:09,760
We sold everything we could.

142
00:09:09,761 --> 00:09:11,721
What we couldn't sell or
fit into our '48 Plymouth

143
00:09:11,745 --> 00:09:13,045
we gave away.

144
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:16,139
When most families take a trip,
they know where they're going.

145
00:09:16,163 --> 00:09:17,163
Not us.

146
00:09:17,202 --> 00:09:19,137
Mama just pointed the car,

147
00:09:19,138 --> 00:09:20,539
sort of north and sort of east,

148
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,973
and away we went.

149
00:09:22,442 --> 00:09:25,243
Ma, would you tell Murray
and Annie to quit it?

150
00:09:25,244 --> 00:09:26,811
Would you two stop?

151
00:09:27,147 --> 00:09:28,514
- Haaa!
- Mama!

152
00:09:29,133 --> 00:09:30,900
Nobody gets the bunny.

153
00:09:35,489 --> 00:09:36,922
I did not, Craig!

154
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:37,925
Yes, you did!

155
00:09:37,926 --> 00:09:38,993
Did not!

156
00:09:38,994 --> 00:09:40,294
Did too!

157
00:09:40,429 --> 00:09:42,129
Mama, I
have to pee-pee.

158
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,430
You just did!

159
00:09:43,882 --> 00:09:46,049
If you kids don't stop this,

160
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:49,037
I'm going to leave you
by the side of the road!

161
00:09:49,038 --> 00:09:51,139
Annie, you just went.
Pipe down.

162
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,640
- Did not!
- Did too.

163
00:09:54,077 --> 00:09:55,611
Pipe down, you two!

164
00:09:55,612 --> 00:09:56,912
Did not!

165
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:58,514
- Did not!
- Did too.

166
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,984
I'm going to come back there.

167
00:10:00,985 --> 00:10:03,818
You don't want me
to come back there.

168
00:10:04,689 --> 00:10:06,522
Jimmy Johnson, K.I.F.I.

169
00:10:06,624 --> 00:10:08,924
Shayne, leave it for a second.

170
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,129
I'd like to hear just one
song all the way through.

171
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,430
Sorry.

172
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,067
It's my turn up front.

173
00:10:16,202 --> 00:10:17,769
- It is not!
- Is too!

174
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,470
Now don't you two start.

175
00:10:20,689 --> 00:10:22,122
Murray, sit down.

176
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,610
You stink bug.

177
00:10:24,978 --> 00:10:26,045
Is too.

178
00:10:26,046 --> 00:10:27,346
Is not!

179
00:10:27,381 --> 00:10:28,681
Pipe down!

180
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,250
Shayne, how'd you like
to take the wheel?

181
00:10:32,274 --> 00:10:33,419
Sure.

182
00:10:33,554 --> 00:10:34,921
Scoot over here.

183
00:10:41,295 --> 00:10:42,595
Thanks.

184
00:10:43,365 --> 00:10:44,665
Hey...

185
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:46,484
How about that place?

186
00:10:46,485 --> 00:10:48,585
It looks like a nice place.

187
00:10:48,654 --> 00:10:49,954
Nope.

188
00:10:50,189 --> 00:10:51,590
I want some orange punch.

189
00:10:51,591 --> 00:10:52,891
Why not?

190
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,727
It ain't the right place.

191
00:10:55,812 --> 00:10:57,846
Then, what is the right place?

192
00:10:57,847 --> 00:10:59,481
I'll know it when I see it.

193
00:10:59,482 --> 00:11:00,782
See...

194
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,454
We'll be driving down this road,

195
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,822
and there's going to be
trees on either side.

196
00:11:07,892 --> 00:11:10,227
And we'll go around the curve...

197
00:11:10,228 --> 00:11:11,795
And there it'll be,

198
00:11:12,163 --> 00:11:13,930
a perfect little town.

199
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,533
Then a little further
on will be our house.

200
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:23,339
Everything will be
buttoned up and beautiful.

201
00:11:24,743 --> 00:11:26,176
Lynn?
Oh, honey.

202
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:28,479
Are you all right?

203
00:11:28,882 --> 00:11:30,782
Give her
some kool-aid.

204
00:11:32,052 --> 00:11:33,719
Murray did it.
Murray did it.

205
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,153
Don't spit in it.

206
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:37,056
Shut up, you little fink.

207
00:11:37,057 --> 00:11:38,957
Cut it out.
Cut it out!

208
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:44,129
Booger eater, booger eater.

209
00:11:46,702 --> 00:11:49,370
Murray, it better not have
come out of your nose.

210
00:11:49,371 --> 00:11:50,671
See it!

211
00:11:50,773 --> 00:11:51,606
Look at that house.

212
00:11:51,607 --> 00:11:52,907
Yeah.

213
00:11:53,909 --> 00:11:56,429
Mama said we would
find us a house this time,

214
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,997
not an apartment,
but a real house, all our own.

215
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,434
We saw lots of possibilities.

216
00:12:01,435 --> 00:12:02,868
Right there. See?

217
00:12:04,304 --> 00:12:05,604
See that deer?

218
00:12:06,174 --> 00:12:09,309
Look at that. Look at all
that space right there!

219
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,077
Perfect for our house.

220
00:12:11,112 --> 00:12:12,412
I want a pony.

221
00:12:13,464 --> 00:12:15,299
Since we were dead broke,

222
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,800
one question kept nagging at me.

223
00:12:17,936 --> 00:12:20,103
Even if we did
find our dream house,

224
00:12:20,104 --> 00:12:22,137
what could we buy it with?

225
00:12:22,273 --> 00:12:24,040
I wish we lived there.

226
00:12:49,054 --> 00:12:50,487
Hurry up, Murray.

227
00:12:50,822 --> 00:12:52,122
Look out!

228
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,425
We've got you.

229
00:12:53,926 --> 00:12:55,226
Take that!

230
00:13:00,332 --> 00:13:02,699
I can patch your radiator here,

231
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,770
but your water pump's gone.
It's shot.

232
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:09,058
These belts look like they're
about ready to give way.

233
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:11,428
And there's maybe one
tire in the whole bunch

234
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:15,129
that'll see you more than
100 yards down the road.

235
00:13:33,336 --> 00:13:34,903
Will this cover it?

236
00:13:36,606 --> 00:13:38,906
Oh, ma'am.
Your wedding ring?

237
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,327
I don't want to take it.

238
00:13:41,328 --> 00:13:43,028
Don't worry about it.

239
00:13:43,397 --> 00:13:46,132
Goddamn vagabond, Irish
Catholic son of a bitch.

240
00:13:46,133 --> 00:13:48,135
Never gave me anything
but grief and kids.

241
00:13:48,136 --> 00:13:50,369
I'm not sentimental about it.

242
00:13:52,057 --> 00:13:55,090
Is it worth enough
to keep my car going?

243
00:13:56,277 --> 00:13:59,710
Lady, this car's worth
more dead than alive...

244
00:13:59,816 --> 00:14:01,916
But I'll do the best I can.

245
00:14:05,604 --> 00:14:08,007
Everyday, for breakfast,
lunch, and dinner,

246
00:14:08,008 --> 00:14:10,175
we ate egg salad sandwiches.

247
00:14:10,377 --> 00:14:13,010
I haven't eaten one since...
Ever.

248
00:14:34,103 --> 00:14:35,604
We drove through 3 states,

249
00:14:35,605 --> 00:14:37,105
one after another.

250
00:14:37,407 --> 00:14:38,974
By the time we reached Idaho,

251
00:14:38,975 --> 00:14:40,808
we'd reached our limits

252
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:43,145
physically, mentally,
and mechanically.

253
00:14:43,146 --> 00:14:44,447
- Mine!
- Mine!

254
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:45,748
- Mine!
- Mine!

255
00:14:46,117 --> 00:14:47,550
It's your turn...

256
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:49,285
I'm not on you!

257
00:14:49,454 --> 00:14:50,754
Shut up!

258
00:14:51,255 --> 00:14:52,622
- Mine!
- Mine!

259
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,457
- Shut up.
- Shut up!

260
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:56,828
There, I broke one of...

261
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,129
Can it!

262
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,900
What is it?

263
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:04,236
At first,

264
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:06,805
I thought
we were out of gas again.

265
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:08,239
But there it was.

266
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:10,809
I'm not sure what it was,

267
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,730
but mama had
that look in her eye.

268
00:15:13,731 --> 00:15:16,898
Wherever we were going,
we'd just arrived.

269
00:16:27,229 --> 00:16:28,529
Oh!

270
00:16:28,897 --> 00:16:30,530
Mama, you scared me.

271
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:35,819
Hey, ma,

272
00:16:35,922 --> 00:16:37,222
come up here.

273
00:16:37,556 --> 00:16:38,440
You can see everything.

274
00:16:38,441 --> 00:16:39,508
Hey, mama.

275
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:40,809
Hey, mama.

276
00:16:43,046 --> 00:16:44,079
All right.

277
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,649
All right, ok, good.

278
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,184
All right, I got it.

279
00:16:47,185 --> 00:16:48,685
Mom, come up here.

280
00:16:48,952 --> 00:16:50,252
Lynn...

281
00:16:50,454 --> 00:16:52,354
Lynn, no, no, no!
Wait.

282
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:56,826
Murray, come on.
Let's get this guy.

283
00:16:57,829 --> 00:16:59,129
Lacey tribe,

284
00:16:59,998 --> 00:17:01,298
come on.

285
00:17:17,651 --> 00:17:18,768
Hello?

286
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:20,069
Hello?

287
00:17:22,373 --> 00:17:23,841
The berries are all done.

288
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,008
No more till next year.

289
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:26,309
All done.

290
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,512
All done.

291
00:17:28,746 --> 00:17:30,113
We don't want any berries.

292
00:17:30,114 --> 00:17:31,747
I want some berries.

293
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,286
Do you know
who owns that property

294
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,138
across the road from you,

295
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,239
the one with the
tumble-down house on it?

296
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,644
Well...
I'm the owner.

297
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:47,282
I want to buy it.

298
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:55,742
My name's Frances Lacey.

299
00:17:55,743 --> 00:17:57,110
That's my tribe.

300
00:17:59,114 --> 00:18:01,315
I'd introduce you to
them one at a time,

301
00:18:01,316 --> 00:18:04,283
but life is short
and time is precious.

302
00:18:09,592 --> 00:18:11,892
I don't know if it's for sale.

303
00:18:16,132 --> 00:18:17,565
I want to buy it.

304
00:18:18,735 --> 00:18:21,437
I want it so bad that I'm in
no position to negotiate.

305
00:18:21,438 --> 00:18:23,198
You can take full advantage.
Name your price.

306
00:18:23,222 --> 00:18:24,522
You rich?

307
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:27,211
I don't have a pot to piss in

308
00:18:27,212 --> 00:18:29,579
or a window to throw it out of.

309
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,757
I have to pee-pee.

310
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:06,237
If that's the case,

311
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,240
how do you expect
to pay for the land?

312
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:11,609
Well, Mr. Moon,

313
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,177
I've learned that the dollar

314
00:19:14,214 --> 00:19:16,574
isn't the only way to get things
done in this great country.

315
00:19:16,598 --> 00:19:17,898
Let's talk.

316
00:19:27,061 --> 00:19:28,561
You live alone,
Mr. Moon?

317
00:19:28,562 --> 00:19:30,697
Yes, if it's any
of your business.

318
00:19:30,698 --> 00:19:32,798
Well, here's what we'll do.

319
00:19:32,935 --> 00:19:34,135
We'll wash your dishes,

320
00:19:34,136 --> 00:19:35,503
do your laundry.

321
00:19:36,171 --> 00:19:38,804
Dishes daily.
Laundry once a week.

322
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:41,941
Clean your house once a week.

323
00:19:42,712 --> 00:19:45,547
My oldest son will give you eight
hours of chores each week,

324
00:19:45,548 --> 00:19:48,581
plus any other work
you may need on call

325
00:19:48,584 --> 00:19:51,084
at minimum wage plus 10 percent.

326
00:19:51,588 --> 00:19:53,221
You pay me interest?

327
00:19:55,292 --> 00:19:57,193
Mr. Moon, this
is slave labor.

328
00:19:57,194 --> 00:19:58,894
Take advantage of it.

329
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,934
You know something?

330
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:09,106
I'm not so sure if I want
a smart lady like you

331
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:11,940
with a bunch of kids
for my neighbor.

332
00:20:15,731 --> 00:20:17,031
Yeah, but...

333
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,467
Look at this place.

334
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,103
Takes a lot of work.

335
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:26,491
How do I know

336
00:20:27,127 --> 00:20:30,027
you won't just
up and run off someday?

337
00:20:30,732 --> 00:20:32,365
Well, if I did that,

338
00:20:32,901 --> 00:20:35,635
then you'd have all that free
labor plus your land back.

339
00:20:35,636 --> 00:20:37,588
But I'm telling you,
Mr. Moon,

340
00:20:37,589 --> 00:20:39,556
if you sell me that land,

341
00:20:39,824 --> 00:20:42,326
I'm building me and my kids a
house we ain't ever leaving,

342
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:45,294
at least not while
I'm still breathing.

343
00:20:49,802 --> 00:20:52,171
So mama talked herself
into 3 acres of land

344
00:20:52,172 --> 00:20:54,339
with a half-finished
shack on it,

345
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,440
and we kind of took over
Mr. Moon's life.

346
00:20:57,711 --> 00:21:00,113
Mama negotiated
2 days of free repairs

347
00:21:00,114 --> 00:21:02,414
that ended up lasting 2 weeks.

348
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,650
He never knew what hit him.

349
00:21:04,885 --> 00:21:06,353
We had a lot of work to do.

350
00:21:06,354 --> 00:21:08,122
It was already getting cold.

351
00:21:08,123 --> 00:21:10,524
We had to get
a roof on and walls up...

352
00:21:10,525 --> 00:21:14,092
if you call canvas tarp
a "roof" and old boards,

353
00:21:18,952 --> 00:21:20,585
bye-bye, tumbleweed.

354
00:21:47,699 --> 00:21:48,999
Pull over.

355
00:21:49,368 --> 00:21:50,668
Pull it.

356
00:21:53,073 --> 00:21:54,506
Over. Over. Over.

357
00:21:57,644 --> 00:21:58,878
Turn which way?

358
00:21:58,879 --> 00:22:00,179
This way!

359
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,314
Ok.

360
00:22:01,315 --> 00:22:02,615
Ok.

361
00:22:02,901 --> 00:22:04,001
Hurry, here it comes.

362
00:22:04,002 --> 00:22:05,302
Here it comes!

363
00:22:10,308 --> 00:22:11,608
Aah!

364
00:22:13,512 --> 00:22:14,612
I'm going to get you!

365
00:22:14,613 --> 00:22:15,913
Aah!

366
00:22:15,948 --> 00:22:17,248
Aah!

367
00:22:17,449 --> 00:22:18,749
Wait up, pals.

368
00:22:18,817 --> 00:22:20,117
Come on!

369
00:22:29,864 --> 00:22:31,164
Here, Faye.

370
00:22:46,848 --> 00:22:48,148
Yay! Yay! Yay!

371
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:50,085
- Yes!
- Yeah!

372
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:54,704
Mama traded our tires
for some furniture.

373
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:57,577
Mr. Moon wanted the name of
the guy who bought them.

374
00:22:57,578 --> 00:23:02,011
He said he wanted proof that he
wasn't the only fool in town.

375
00:23:11,276 --> 00:23:12,609
So what do you know how to do?

376
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:13,910
I work.

377
00:23:14,746 --> 00:23:17,313
I've done it all my life.
I work.

378
00:23:17,783 --> 00:23:20,883
I learn fast, and I
do my share and more.

379
00:23:21,287 --> 00:23:23,187
Yeah, well, I do need
another waitress.

380
00:23:23,188 --> 00:23:24,621
Then you got one.

381
00:23:32,165 --> 00:23:33,465
Minimum wage.

382
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:35,302
Your tips are your own,

383
00:23:35,303 --> 00:23:37,270
and they ain't
much in this town.

384
00:23:37,271 --> 00:23:39,304
I'll manage.
I always do.

385
00:23:39,407 --> 00:23:40,774
I'll bet you do.

386
00:23:42,943 --> 00:23:45,012
This here's Norman, my manager.

387
00:23:45,013 --> 00:23:47,113
You'll be working under me.

388
00:23:47,949 --> 00:23:49,849
I'll be working for you.

389
00:23:54,924 --> 00:23:56,224
Frances.

390
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,860
Frances.

391
00:24:03,918 --> 00:24:05,885
I tried to get any job I could.

392
00:24:05,886 --> 00:24:07,453
I wasn't particular

393
00:24:07,555 --> 00:24:09,722
as long as I could make money.

394
00:24:09,723 --> 00:24:12,023
I finally got work at a dairy.

395
00:24:14,028 --> 00:24:15,395
I don't know
who hated it more...

396
00:24:15,396 --> 00:24:16,696
me or the cows.

397
00:24:20,134 --> 00:24:22,471
This dumb blanket won't stay up.

398
00:24:22,472 --> 00:24:24,039
I already got some.

399
00:24:28,911 --> 00:24:30,611
Give me a hand, Lynn.

400
00:24:34,084 --> 00:24:36,184
Hey, hey,
Mr. Moon's here!

401
00:24:38,121 --> 00:24:39,421
Thanks.

402
00:24:41,058 --> 00:24:43,293
What are you up to,
Mr. Moon?

403
00:24:43,294 --> 00:24:44,495
You see...

404
00:24:44,496 --> 00:24:45,796
I had all this

405
00:24:46,263 --> 00:24:47,830
spare window glass.

406
00:24:58,327 --> 00:25:01,694
A man with a greenhouse
keeps plenty on hand.

407
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:04,516
I used some of your wood.

408
00:25:07,788 --> 00:25:09,088
Glazed windows.

409
00:25:11,058 --> 00:25:13,625
And now I'm ready
to put them in.

410
00:25:18,066 --> 00:25:21,966
I don't have the money to
pay you for this, Mr. Moon.

411
00:25:22,404 --> 00:25:23,704
Well...

412
00:25:25,374 --> 00:25:26,874
I'm not doing this

413
00:25:27,093 --> 00:25:29,193
for the money,
Mrs. Lacey.

414
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:32,930
I do well enough

415
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:35,099
with the nursery.

416
00:25:38,071 --> 00:25:40,372
Well, I want an
accounting of your time

417
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:42,074
and the cost of your materials

418
00:25:42,075 --> 00:25:44,242
so I can give
you an I.O.U.

419
00:25:44,745 --> 00:25:46,346
I don't like owing anybody,

420
00:25:46,347 --> 00:25:48,282
but you backed me into a corner.

421
00:25:48,283 --> 00:25:50,583
And I'd appreciate
it a hell of a lot

422
00:25:50,584 --> 00:25:54,551
if you'd let me know next
time you decide to help out.

423
00:26:20,284 --> 00:26:21,584
Come on.

424
00:26:22,337 --> 00:26:24,338
Mama had promised
I'd do Mr. Moon's chores,

425
00:26:24,339 --> 00:26:25,974
so I didn't have much choice.

426
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:28,309
But running his tractor was fun,

427
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,943
and that's how
I learned to drive.

428
00:26:44,495 --> 00:26:45,595
Hi.

429
00:26:45,596 --> 00:26:46,896
Hello.

430
00:26:48,666 --> 00:26:50,699
How does that look, Craig?

431
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,570
Pretty good.

432
00:27:00,246 --> 00:27:02,080
Let's sleep on the roof.

433
00:27:02,081 --> 00:27:03,348
I want that room.

434
00:27:03,349 --> 00:27:05,516
You can't sleep on the roof!

435
00:27:05,551 --> 00:27:07,819
Mom, can I have my own bathroom?

436
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,722
Can I have a pink
princess phone?

437
00:27:09,723 --> 00:27:12,223
Mom, can I have my own bathroom?

438
00:27:12,726 --> 00:27:14,426
School was coming up,

439
00:27:14,561 --> 00:27:16,696
so when the hand-me-downs
wore out,

440
00:27:16,697 --> 00:27:18,999
the church basement
was our department store.

441
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,400
This wasn't so bad.

442
00:27:20,401 --> 00:27:21,968
It was all we knew.

443
00:27:35,034 --> 00:27:36,934
Lynn, what do you think?

444
00:27:38,104 --> 00:27:39,404
It's beautiful.

445
00:27:39,572 --> 00:27:41,072
You should get it.

446
00:27:41,141 --> 00:27:42,441
Mama.

447
00:27:42,842 --> 00:27:44,142
Oh, no, honey.

448
00:27:44,277 --> 00:27:45,577
Annie.

449
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,000
Lacey tribe.

450
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,103
We need galoshes for winter.

451
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:55,473
You've never seen winter,
have you, Annie?

452
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:56,774
No.

453
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:59,609
Help her pick out a pair, Lynn.

454
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:01,879
Craig.

455
00:28:05,918 --> 00:28:07,418
Here. Try this on.

456
00:28:07,454 --> 00:28:08,754
Mom, look!

457
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:12,490
Good day, ma'am.

458
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:14,726
Uh, I'm Father Tomlin.

459
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,831
I think you may be new
to our little town.

460
00:28:17,832 --> 00:28:19,465
Mom, look what I found.

461
00:28:19,466 --> 00:28:21,601
Hope that we'll see you
at Sunday mass soon.

462
00:28:21,602 --> 00:28:23,235
Try again, liberace.

463
00:28:24,873 --> 00:28:26,673
Unless, of course,
your convictions

464
00:28:26,674 --> 00:28:28,542
take you to another church.

465
00:28:28,543 --> 00:28:31,445
Actually, we Laceys
are nondenominational.

466
00:28:31,446 --> 00:28:33,581
Well, that's neither here
nor there at the moment,

467
00:28:33,582 --> 00:28:35,283
but perhaps I could tell you

468
00:28:35,284 --> 00:28:38,051
about our program
to help the needy.

469
00:28:38,287 --> 00:28:40,520
We can provide without charge

470
00:28:40,556 --> 00:28:42,992
an allotment of clothing for
each member of the family...

471
00:28:42,993 --> 00:28:45,128
Murray, we didn't come here
looking for toys.

472
00:28:45,129 --> 00:28:48,096
Come back here
and try on this sweater.

473
00:28:48,632 --> 00:28:51,368
Uh, in addition to the clothing
items, basic food items...

474
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:52,669
mama, look!

475
00:28:53,437 --> 00:28:54,737
Lynn, no.

476
00:28:58,076 --> 00:29:00,443
Uh, basic food items and so on,

477
00:29:01,346 --> 00:29:02,847
all without obligation,

478
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,582
religious or otherwise.

479
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:07,950
Well, thanks very much,
mister, uh... Father,

480
00:29:08,254 --> 00:29:10,355
but we Laceys
don't accept charity.

481
00:29:10,356 --> 00:29:11,923
We pay our own way.

482
00:29:12,392 --> 00:29:13,692
Well, uh,

483
00:29:14,394 --> 00:29:16,894
if... if you
change your mind...

484
00:29:23,037 --> 00:29:24,337
Lynn.

485
00:29:28,576 --> 00:29:30,845
Do me a favor. Take
this back, will you?

486
00:29:30,846 --> 00:29:32,213
But it'll look so nice on you.

487
00:29:32,214 --> 00:29:33,514
Take it back.

488
00:29:37,787 --> 00:29:39,354
The really bad part

489
00:29:39,856 --> 00:29:43,556
was when mama decided
to make our clothes herself.

490
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:55,555
Hey, Lacey, where'd you get
the howdy doody dresses?

491
00:29:55,556 --> 00:29:57,157
They're not howdy doody.

492
00:29:57,158 --> 00:29:58,658
My mama made them.

493
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,061
Where'd she get the material?

494
00:30:01,062 --> 00:30:03,464
Did somebody shoot a
sofa and skin it?

495
00:30:03,465 --> 00:30:05,232
"Howdy doody dresses"

496
00:30:05,651 --> 00:30:07,418
"howdy doody dresses"

497
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:51,366
Murray still didn't seem
to fit into our world,

498
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:52,800
but then one day,

499
00:30:52,903 --> 00:30:54,803
he found one of his own.

500
00:30:55,305 --> 00:30:56,605
Stop the bus!

501
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,825
Stop the bus.
Stop the bus!

502
00:30:58,826 --> 00:31:00,126
Stop the bus.

503
00:31:00,461 --> 00:31:02,561
Get back in your seat, kid.

504
00:31:03,365 --> 00:31:04,665
Stop the bus,

505
00:31:04,766 --> 00:31:06,467
or I'll barf in your hat.

506
00:31:06,468 --> 00:31:07,768
Eew! Eew! Eew!

507
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,410
I'll walk home.

508
00:32:24,737 --> 00:32:26,037
You lost, boy?

509
00:32:26,673 --> 00:32:27,973
No.

510
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,110
No.

511
00:32:32,646 --> 00:32:34,679
I want some of this stuff.

512
00:32:39,187 --> 00:32:40,487
You got money?

513
00:32:41,356 --> 00:32:42,656
Mmm. No.

514
00:32:43,926 --> 00:32:45,493
Well, how do you expect to pay

515
00:32:45,494 --> 00:32:47,262
for the stuff you want?

516
00:32:47,263 --> 00:32:48,563
Well, mister,

517
00:32:49,365 --> 00:32:50,998
I've learned that...

518
00:32:51,016 --> 00:32:52,316
I've learned...

519
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:55,955
That the greenback dollar
isn't the only way

520
00:32:55,956 --> 00:32:59,325
to get things done
in this here great country.

521
00:32:59,326 --> 00:33:00,626
Let's talk.

522
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:13,591
All right, son.

523
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:19,097
Let's find this stuff you want.

524
00:33:19,098 --> 00:33:20,998
I need help around here.

525
00:33:30,645 --> 00:33:31,945
Murray!

526
00:33:34,314 --> 00:33:35,682
What's with the wagon,

527
00:33:35,683 --> 00:33:37,417
and what's with the toilet?

528
00:33:37,418 --> 00:33:39,085
I got a job.
I earned it.

529
00:33:39,086 --> 00:33:40,755
Come on, give me a hand.

530
00:33:40,756 --> 00:33:43,223
You got a job, and
you earned a toilet?

531
00:33:43,224 --> 00:33:46,260
Yeah. So we don't have to
use the dumb old outhouse.

532
00:33:46,261 --> 00:33:47,894
I hate the outhouse.

533
00:33:49,632 --> 00:33:51,599
So for 3 days every week,

534
00:33:51,901 --> 00:33:55,103
Murray came home hauling some
new treasures from Mr. king.

535
00:33:55,104 --> 00:33:56,872
We never knew what to expect...

536
00:33:56,873 --> 00:33:58,906
French doors, a gas stove,

537
00:33:59,476 --> 00:34:01,811
a set of cracked China dishes...

538
00:34:01,812 --> 00:34:03,712
In smelly old
Mr. king,

539
00:34:03,714 --> 00:34:05,682
Murray found a kindred soul,

540
00:34:05,683 --> 00:34:07,916
a fellow connoisseur of junk.

541
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,390
Come on.

542
00:34:13,424 --> 00:34:14,991
Come on what is it?

543
00:34:15,126 --> 00:34:17,826
What did you get
this time, Murray?

544
00:34:18,297 --> 00:34:19,230
Couches and everything.

545
00:34:19,231 --> 00:34:20,331
Wow.

546
00:34:20,332 --> 00:34:21,632
I'm tired.

547
00:34:26,306 --> 00:34:28,273
I got all sorts of stuff.

548
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,160
Mr. Moon?

549
00:34:46,328 --> 00:34:47,628
Yes, miss Faye.

550
00:34:49,064 --> 00:34:50,564
Where's Mrs. Moon?

551
00:34:58,541 --> 00:34:59,841
Well...

552
00:35:01,311 --> 00:35:04,278
She went on a long
journey ahead of me.

553
00:35:04,882 --> 00:35:06,982
Why didn't you go with her?

554
00:35:09,453 --> 00:35:12,086
I had to wait here
for the Laceys.

555
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:45,275
Every morning,
I went to work in the dark,

556
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:47,695
then I had to walk
4 more Miles to school.

557
00:35:47,696 --> 00:35:49,663
Sometimes I'd get a ride,

558
00:35:49,665 --> 00:35:51,700
but more often,
I'd walk all the way.

559
00:35:51,701 --> 00:35:53,868
It gave me plenty
of time to think,

560
00:35:53,869 --> 00:35:56,236
and mostly what I thought about

561
00:35:56,538 --> 00:35:59,371
was how much I hated
Hankston, Idaho.

562
00:36:09,887 --> 00:36:11,154
Eh, Murray!
Come on up here.

563
00:36:11,155 --> 00:36:12,455
Come on Murray.

564
00:36:16,728 --> 00:36:17,729
You ready?

565
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,030
Yeah!

566
00:36:57,556 --> 00:36:59,589
Murray, that's disgusting!

567
00:37:00,527 --> 00:37:01,827
Murray!

568
00:37:02,896 --> 00:37:03,795
Just get to work.

569
00:37:03,796 --> 00:37:05,096
I am.

570
00:37:10,905 --> 00:37:12,205
Aah!

571
00:37:13,742 --> 00:37:15,042
Murray!

572
00:37:18,446 --> 00:37:19,746
Murray!

573
00:37:20,498 --> 00:37:21,798
Murray!

574
00:37:23,302 --> 00:37:24,836
Murray, you all right?

575
00:37:24,837 --> 00:37:26,137
Huh?

576
00:37:26,405 --> 00:37:27,772
Murray, come on.

577
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:31,641
- Come on.
- Look, Shayne!

578
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,210
Shayne, look!

579
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,680
Look, Shayne!

580
00:37:34,764 --> 00:37:36,064
Shayne, look!

581
00:37:36,099 --> 00:37:37,399
What?

582
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:44,958
Hold on.
This is going to hurt.

583
00:37:44,959 --> 00:37:47,192
It's going to hurt all right.

584
00:37:56,471 --> 00:37:57,771
Ow!

585
00:38:01,644 --> 00:38:03,411
It should be all right.

586
00:38:03,412 --> 00:38:05,045
You'll be all right.

587
00:38:06,799 --> 00:38:08,499
I'm getting Mr. Moon.

588
00:38:19,081 --> 00:38:20,380
It's all right.

589
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,881
Don't die, Murray.

590
00:38:26,021 --> 00:38:27,321
Stay here.

591
00:38:33,896 --> 00:38:36,231
But Mr. Moon wasn't
home to help us.

592
00:38:36,232 --> 00:38:38,067
He had driven mama into town.

593
00:38:38,068 --> 00:38:40,536
I had to carry Murray
to the hospital.

594
00:38:40,537 --> 00:38:42,570
He was crying all the way.

595
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:16,159
What the hell happened?

596
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,594
Get him in the truck.

597
00:39:17,595 --> 00:39:19,296
It's not my fault, mama.

598
00:39:19,297 --> 00:39:22,130
He fell on a nail,
and he's bleeding.

599
00:39:32,461 --> 00:39:34,696
Dr. Bartlett, you're needed
in room two.

600
00:39:34,697 --> 00:39:35,664
Mrs. Lacey.

601
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:36,965
Yes.

602
00:39:38,401 --> 00:39:40,968
You have a very
lucky little boy.

603
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:44,238
Another, oh,
2 centimeters or so,

604
00:39:44,441 --> 00:39:46,108
and that nail would've
punctured his lung.

605
00:39:46,109 --> 00:39:47,744
- Is he ok?
- He's fine.

606
00:39:47,745 --> 00:39:48,745
Can I see him?

607
00:39:48,746 --> 00:39:49,879
You can take him home.

608
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,180
Oh!

609
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:54,985
Just try to keep him in
bed for a couple of days

610
00:39:54,986 --> 00:39:57,019
and keep that wound clean.

611
00:40:02,127 --> 00:40:03,628
You give that to them upstairs.

612
00:40:03,629 --> 00:40:04,929
Thank you.

613
00:40:05,364 --> 00:40:06,731
Interesting kid.

614
00:40:09,602 --> 00:40:10,902
You're ok?

615
00:40:11,505 --> 00:40:13,372
I had made mama a promise.

616
00:40:13,373 --> 00:40:15,206
I told her I'd keep it.

617
00:40:15,526 --> 00:40:16,959
But I wasn't dad,

618
00:40:17,027 --> 00:40:19,563
and I was sick of
pretending I was.

619
00:40:19,564 --> 00:40:21,165
I knew that when
the house was done,

620
00:40:21,166 --> 00:40:22,866
I was going back
to L.A.

621
00:40:22,867 --> 00:40:24,868
There was more to do,
I had friends there,

622
00:40:24,869 --> 00:40:26,769
and it was a lot warmer.

623
00:40:54,736 --> 00:40:55,702
Warm it up for you?

624
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,003
Yes.

625
00:40:58,173 --> 00:41:02,073
And he says, "you're not
here for the hunt, are you?"

626
00:41:02,811 --> 00:41:04,345
Can I get you anything else?

627
00:41:04,346 --> 00:41:06,281
We're out of here, Franny.

628
00:41:06,282 --> 00:41:08,149
How about you and your
tribe helping us out

629
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:10,317
over on that remodeling job?

630
00:41:11,087 --> 00:41:13,207
We'd be on the job site, not
loafing around over here.

631
00:41:13,231 --> 00:41:14,531
Woh! Wooo!

632
00:41:15,659 --> 00:41:17,826
I'm short of cash this week.

633
00:41:18,462 --> 00:41:19,262
This will have to do for a tip.

634
00:41:19,263 --> 00:41:20,563
You're kidding.

635
00:41:21,932 --> 00:41:24,899
Dave, this means
more to me than money.

636
00:41:25,737 --> 00:41:27,037
Let's go.

637
00:41:33,077 --> 00:41:35,580
In Los Angeles,
mama worked her butt off

638
00:41:35,581 --> 00:41:37,948
just to get us from day to day.

639
00:41:38,117 --> 00:41:40,318
Now we all had to earn
enough to live on

640
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:43,152
and put something away
for our house.

641
00:41:50,013 --> 00:41:53,082
We all worked on that house
every chance we got,

642
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:55,218
but there were some things
we couldn't do,

643
00:41:55,219 --> 00:41:58,188
so mama hired contractors
for those jobs.

644
00:41:58,189 --> 00:41:59,489
God help 'em.

645
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,560
Over here!

646
00:42:07,416 --> 00:42:09,684
Yeah, sure,
we can take care of it.

647
00:42:09,685 --> 00:42:11,052
I know you guys,

648
00:42:11,588 --> 00:42:14,056
you buy your goddamn
wiring and your fixtures,

649
00:42:14,057 --> 00:42:16,959
you mark it up 20, 50 percent,
and you soak me for it.

650
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,727
I want an estimate
for manpower only

651
00:42:19,796 --> 00:42:21,798
and a list of what
material you'll need.

652
00:42:21,799 --> 00:42:23,333
I'll haggle for
the materials myself.

653
00:42:23,334 --> 00:42:24,634
Any questions?

654
00:42:24,969 --> 00:42:26,369
I ain't got much time.

655
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:28,203
I got to get to my job.

656
00:42:28,973 --> 00:42:30,674
I know you think
I'm a hard-nosed bitch.

657
00:42:30,675 --> 00:42:31,975
Don't deny it.

658
00:42:32,244 --> 00:42:34,078
I am when it comes
to this house.

659
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,913
But I also know
I'm at your mercy.

660
00:42:35,914 --> 00:42:37,881
Treat me honestly
like I'll treat you.

661
00:42:37,882 --> 00:42:39,382
I'll deal in cash,

662
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:41,453
so we may have to
do this piecemeal,

663
00:42:41,454 --> 00:42:43,655
but there won't be
any corner cutting.

664
00:42:43,656 --> 00:42:45,390
I want the best for this house.
The best.

665
00:42:45,391 --> 00:42:46,691
Lacey tribe.

666
00:42:59,241 --> 00:43:01,474
Show Mr. Whitman
your hands.

667
00:43:03,278 --> 00:43:05,078
Every penny you spend is a penny

668
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:07,449
me and these
little hands earned.

669
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:10,418
Don't make those blisters
count for nothing.

670
00:43:10,419 --> 00:43:14,119
There. I've tried it all...
guilt, fear, and pity.

671
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:16,958
You understand me now,
Mr. Whitman?

672
00:43:16,959 --> 00:43:19,059
You're shirt.
You're skin.

673
00:43:19,462 --> 00:43:21,497
Laughlin, get a haircut
or a dog license.

674
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:23,398
You look like an animal.

675
00:43:25,134 --> 00:43:27,003
Stand up straight like a man,

676
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:29,904
not like some old woman.
There you go.

677
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,407
Lacey.

678
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,577
Yeah?

679
00:43:35,314 --> 00:43:37,414
Just what the hell is that?

680
00:43:37,683 --> 00:43:40,784
Well, my sister's red socks
got in with the whites,

681
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:42,985
and it turned the sheets and
pillowcases and the t-shirt

682
00:43:43,009 --> 00:43:44,309
kind of pink.

683
00:43:44,357 --> 00:43:45,924
Go get another one.

684
00:43:45,925 --> 00:43:48,758
Well sir, this is
the only one I got.

685
00:43:48,961 --> 00:43:50,728
What, are you kidding?

686
00:43:51,531 --> 00:43:54,934
Lacey, I told you at the
beginning of the term

687
00:43:54,935 --> 00:43:56,969
that you'd require a white
t-shirt, did I not?

688
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:58,270
Yes, you did.

689
00:43:58,472 --> 00:44:00,172
White. Is that white?

690
00:44:01,108 --> 00:44:02,742
No, sir, it's a little off.

691
00:44:02,743 --> 00:44:04,043
A little off?

692
00:44:05,847 --> 00:44:08,614
I'd call that titty
pink, huh, guys?

693
00:44:09,183 --> 00:44:11,418
You're a shirt. You're a skin.
Let's go.

694
00:44:11,419 --> 00:44:12,988
Let's move it, guys.

695
00:44:12,989 --> 00:44:14,889
Let's go!
Lacey. Lacey.

696
00:44:19,195 --> 00:44:22,731
Listen, uh, why don't you just
go play with the girls?

697
00:44:22,732 --> 00:44:25,499
Better yet,
sit on the girls' bench.

698
00:44:28,305 --> 00:44:32,538
Your titty pink shirt will fit
in a lot better over there.

699
00:44:34,979 --> 00:44:37,946
Right over there
between the two girls.

700
00:44:43,422 --> 00:44:45,156
All right, guys, come on!

701
00:44:45,157 --> 00:44:47,024
Everybody over here.
Let's go!

702
00:44:47,025 --> 00:44:49,828
Shirts, you're going that way.
Skins, that way.

703
00:44:49,829 --> 00:44:51,929
Your grade depends on this.

704
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,147
Her name was Raymi,

705
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:10,551
and I couldn't have met her

706
00:45:10,552 --> 00:45:13,053
under more embarrassing
circumstances,

707
00:45:13,054 --> 00:45:17,021
but at last I had one good
reason to stay in Hankston.

708
00:45:22,582 --> 00:45:24,083
You can't take that test.

709
00:45:24,084 --> 00:45:25,717
You can't even read.

710
00:45:26,186 --> 00:45:28,219
I can read as good as you.

711
00:45:33,594 --> 00:45:35,996
Mom, Murray needs a compass
and protractor for school.

712
00:45:35,997 --> 00:45:37,630
Can't he borrow one?

713
00:45:37,933 --> 00:45:39,867
Mrs. Tipton said he has
to have a set of his own

714
00:45:39,868 --> 00:45:41,501
or she'll flunk him.

715
00:45:42,904 --> 00:45:45,005
I'll give you money
when you go back to school.

716
00:45:45,006 --> 00:45:46,306
Mama,

717
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:48,625
I still feel sick.

718
00:45:50,045 --> 00:45:51,913
Just stay in bed, honey,
and keep warm.

719
00:45:51,914 --> 00:45:53,115
We'll save you something.

720
00:45:53,116 --> 00:45:54,416
Wait, Shayne!

721
00:45:56,886 --> 00:46:00,022
Mom, I need a new white
t-shirt for gym class.

722
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:00,990
Damn, Shayne.
Another one?

723
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:02,291
Yes.

724
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,760
Take the potatoes and the gravy.

725
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:07,430
Everybody sit down.

726
00:46:10,535 --> 00:46:13,235
You see, it's gotten
kind of green.

727
00:46:13,588 --> 00:46:16,790
Murray's green pants
got in with the whites.

728
00:46:16,791 --> 00:46:18,893
Green, white, red, blue.
What's the difference?

729
00:46:18,894 --> 00:46:20,928
What do you want, gold lami?

730
00:46:20,929 --> 00:46:22,962
Everybody else's is white.

731
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,867
I got to have
a white t-shirt.

732
00:46:27,603 --> 00:46:30,570
Don't you tell me
what you got to have.

733
00:46:30,773 --> 00:46:33,543
You got to have a roof over your
head and food on the table,

734
00:46:33,544 --> 00:46:37,311
and you got that. You're
not getting a new t-shirt.

735
00:46:47,825 --> 00:46:48,959
Hi, Mr. Moon.

736
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,260
Hi, Mr. Moon.

737
00:46:50,463 --> 00:46:52,147
Pumpkin.
Made them myself.

738
00:46:52,148 --> 00:46:53,448
Still warm.

739
00:46:53,449 --> 00:46:55,482
Mr. Moon,
please come in.

740
00:46:58,154 --> 00:47:00,723
Sit down.
Let me take your jacket.

741
00:47:00,724 --> 00:47:02,024
Thank you.

742
00:47:03,294 --> 00:47:05,394
Happy Thanksgiving, Laceys.

743
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:08,263
Happy Thanksgiving, Mr. Moon.

744
00:47:11,502 --> 00:47:13,402
Faye's not feeling well.

745
00:47:17,342 --> 00:47:18,977
Are you a praying man,
Mr. Moon?

746
00:47:18,978 --> 00:47:20,878
I'm a failed Catholic...

747
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,080
But, yes.

748
00:47:24,783 --> 00:47:26,351
We're not religious either,

749
00:47:26,352 --> 00:47:27,987
but a taste of it couldn't hurt,

750
00:47:27,988 --> 00:47:29,521
and who knows?
It might take

751
00:47:29,522 --> 00:47:31,489
on one of these heathens.

752
00:47:37,265 --> 00:47:40,298
Lord, we have much
to give thanks for...

753
00:47:41,285 --> 00:47:42,585
But this year,

754
00:47:43,221 --> 00:47:45,121
I have a special thanks.

755
00:47:46,858 --> 00:47:48,158
Thank you,

756
00:47:48,527 --> 00:47:50,227
for the Lacey family,

757
00:47:51,196 --> 00:47:53,096
which came into my life,

758
00:47:53,932 --> 00:47:55,899
and turned it upside-down

759
00:47:56,769 --> 00:47:58,069
and made...

760
00:48:01,407 --> 00:48:03,707
Made it much more interesting.

761
00:48:05,879 --> 00:48:07,179
And my house,

762
00:48:08,182 --> 00:48:09,482
is very clean.

763
00:48:11,352 --> 00:48:12,652
Amen.

764
00:48:14,356 --> 00:48:15,656
Amen.

765
00:48:17,091 --> 00:48:18,458
- Amen.
- Amen.

766
00:48:20,578 --> 00:48:21,878
Give it back.

767
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,980
Busy.

768
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:47,557
Can you hold it?

769
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:49,459
I don't know.

770
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:51,061
It's freezing.

771
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:23,230
Hey.

772
00:49:24,566 --> 00:49:28,599
I wiped that butt a long time
before you did, you know.

773
00:49:28,738 --> 00:49:32,238
Next thing we're working
on is indoor plumbing.

774
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:51,745
Hey, there.

775
00:49:52,013 --> 00:49:53,313
Hi, Norm.

776
00:49:55,083 --> 00:49:57,452
Uh, Dave Pollock
left this for you.

777
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:58,753
Beautiful.

778
00:49:59,655 --> 00:50:02,422
A 4-d fuse box
in perfect condition.

779
00:50:02,725 --> 00:50:04,793
Don't get all hot and
bothered over a tin box.

780
00:50:04,794 --> 00:50:06,996
Well, we make do
with what we got.

781
00:50:06,997 --> 00:50:09,782
It's the best thing that's
happened to me all day.

782
00:50:09,783 --> 00:50:12,585
How about I take you to
Crossroads after we close?

783
00:50:12,586 --> 00:50:13,953
They got a band.

784
00:50:14,854 --> 00:50:16,757
I got to get home to my kids.

785
00:50:16,758 --> 00:50:18,392
Just a few minutes
kicking up your heels

786
00:50:18,393 --> 00:50:20,360
one night in... How long?

787
00:50:20,961 --> 00:50:22,061
I don't even remember.

788
00:50:22,062 --> 00:50:23,362
See.

789
00:50:23,765 --> 00:50:26,532
One drink, one dance,
straight home.

790
00:50:28,003 --> 00:50:29,937
I got some old
electrical conduit

791
00:50:29,938 --> 00:50:32,105
I'll throw into the bargain.

792
00:50:32,274 --> 00:50:34,610
How much conduit
we talking about?

793
00:50:34,611 --> 00:50:36,511
How much can you handle?

794
00:50:37,414 --> 00:50:41,647
Norman, if it isn't connected
to this, I ain't interested.

795
00:50:42,084 --> 00:50:44,451
But I will go dancing with you.

796
00:50:44,789 --> 00:50:47,489
One beer, one dance,
and then home.

797
00:50:49,159 --> 00:50:50,992
That'll be all for you?

798
00:50:59,037 --> 00:51:00,338
- There's mom.
- Hi, mom.

799
00:51:00,339 --> 00:51:01,639
Hi, mom.

800
00:51:01,708 --> 00:51:03,875
- Hi, mom.
- Tips were good tonight.

801
00:51:04,444 --> 00:51:05,944
Murray, get the jar.

802
00:51:05,945 --> 00:51:07,245
What's that?

803
00:51:11,084 --> 00:51:12,819
I saved you some supper.

804
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,720
Oh, well, I already ate.

805
00:51:15,422 --> 00:51:18,455
Here's some ham
sandwiches for tomorrow.

806
00:51:19,477 --> 00:51:21,044
I've been thinking.

807
00:51:22,214 --> 00:51:24,848
This Christmas, we don't need
to get each other presents.

808
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:26,884
We'll get presents
for our house.

809
00:51:26,885 --> 00:51:28,385
Like a television?

810
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,222
Well, maybe not like a
great big old television.

811
00:51:31,223 --> 00:51:32,656
What about Santa?

812
00:51:33,058 --> 00:51:35,894
Well, he'll get presents
for our house, too.

813
00:51:35,895 --> 00:51:37,595
Can Santa bring a TV?

814
00:51:38,146 --> 00:51:39,779
It's too big, dummy.

815
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:42,817
Shut up, Annie. I want a TV.

816
00:51:43,987 --> 00:51:45,487
What do you think?

817
00:51:46,022 --> 00:51:47,389
It's ok with me.

818
00:51:47,957 --> 00:51:50,590
- I like the idea.
- Fine with me.

819
00:51:51,496 --> 00:51:52,996
What do you think?

820
00:51:54,098 --> 00:51:54,931
Sure.

821
00:51:54,932 --> 00:51:56,232
Huh?

822
00:51:56,401 --> 00:51:58,101
Sure.
You were late.

823
00:51:59,204 --> 00:52:00,504
What?

824
00:52:01,139 --> 00:52:03,307
I said you were late.
Where were you?

825
00:52:03,308 --> 00:52:04,808
I went for a beer.

826
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:06,610
Really?

827
00:52:06,645 --> 00:52:07,945
With Norm?

828
00:52:10,016 --> 00:52:11,316
Yes, with Norm.

829
00:52:23,764 --> 00:52:25,197
You listen to me.

830
00:52:26,067 --> 00:52:28,502
You leave my private life
to me, Shayne Patrick,

831
00:52:28,503 --> 00:52:30,470
what little I have of it.

832
00:52:33,875 --> 00:52:35,577
This weekend we get the tree!

833
00:52:35,578 --> 00:52:36,878
Yay! Yay! Yay!

834
00:52:41,884 --> 00:52:43,852
When you're really, really poor,

835
00:52:43,853 --> 00:52:45,353
everything you see

836
00:52:45,622 --> 00:52:47,789
is something you can't have.

837
00:52:51,161 --> 00:52:52,461
- Shayne?
- Yeah.

838
00:52:53,465 --> 00:52:55,231
What are you going to
get mama for Christmas?

839
00:52:55,232 --> 00:52:56,532
I don't know.

840
00:52:57,502 --> 00:52:59,202
Maybe some stockings.

841
00:53:02,039 --> 00:53:05,142
I saw her crying last night
when she ruined her last pair.

842
00:53:05,143 --> 00:53:09,310
I thought we were supposed to
get presents for our house.

843
00:53:09,949 --> 00:53:12,182
That's just talk, that's all.

844
00:53:12,418 --> 00:53:13,718
You sure?

845
00:53:13,887 --> 00:53:15,788
We wrote that letter to Santa.

846
00:53:15,789 --> 00:53:18,556
Yeah. You know
how mom always talks.

847
00:53:19,258 --> 00:53:20,618
Does that mean
I get a Bowie knife?

848
00:53:20,642 --> 00:53:21,942
No.

849
00:53:27,618 --> 00:53:29,752
Coming through.
Coming through.

850
00:53:29,753 --> 00:53:31,053
Step aside.

851
00:53:31,256 --> 00:53:32,556
Thanks.

852
00:53:35,793 --> 00:53:37,093
Wait, wait.

853
00:53:44,553 --> 00:53:46,254
When I was a kid,
we had an old bathtub.

854
00:53:46,255 --> 00:53:47,555
It was so big,

855
00:53:47,706 --> 00:53:49,542
I could lay down up to my chin.

856
00:53:49,543 --> 00:53:51,377
My knees would
still be underwater.

857
00:53:51,378 --> 00:53:52,945
I'd read for hours.

858
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:55,848
The books would get all fat and
crinkly from the dampness.

859
00:53:55,849 --> 00:53:57,983
Did you live in
a house of your own?

860
00:53:57,984 --> 00:54:00,417
Yeah. Lived there
until I left.

861
00:54:01,889 --> 00:54:04,458
How's Santa going to come
if we don't have a chimbly?

862
00:54:04,459 --> 00:54:05,759
It's chimney.

863
00:54:06,861 --> 00:54:08,930
He'll have to come
through the keyhole,

864
00:54:08,931 --> 00:54:10,598
like he did in Los Angeles.

865
00:54:10,599 --> 00:54:12,133
- Dummy!
- You're the dummy!

866
00:54:12,134 --> 00:54:13,168
Dummy!
You are.

867
00:54:13,169 --> 00:54:14,469
No, you are.

868
00:54:17,073 --> 00:54:19,007
The water's getting all gunky.

869
00:54:19,008 --> 00:54:20,441
Look who's in it.

870
00:54:21,511 --> 00:54:24,278
Why am I always last
to take a bath?

871
00:54:24,414 --> 00:54:27,317
'Cause nobody wants to wash
after you've been in there.

872
00:54:27,318 --> 00:54:28,618
Well, I'm done.

873
00:54:29,753 --> 00:54:31,586
Not so fast, young man.

874
00:54:33,124 --> 00:54:34,424
Let me see those ears.

875
00:54:34,425 --> 00:54:35,725
I cleaned them.

876
00:54:36,695 --> 00:54:39,630
Oh, Murray. You could
plant potatoes in there.

877
00:54:39,631 --> 00:54:40,931
Ouch!

878
00:54:41,433 --> 00:54:44,933
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
I'm sorry, baby.

879
00:54:45,505 --> 00:54:49,872
You're getting to be an independent
little snot, aren't you?

880
00:54:55,966 --> 00:54:57,867
Hello again,
Mrs. Lacey.

881
00:54:57,868 --> 00:54:59,168
Every year,

882
00:54:59,302 --> 00:55:00,670
we pass out these presents

883
00:55:00,671 --> 00:55:02,372
to the needy children...

884
00:55:02,373 --> 00:55:04,307
needy children?
Good for you Father!

885
00:55:04,308 --> 00:55:07,277
I suggest you find some.
There's none here.

886
00:55:07,278 --> 00:55:09,880
I'm sure your children would
appreciate some gesture...

887
00:55:09,881 --> 00:55:12,416
my children's gifts
are already under the tree.

888
00:55:12,417 --> 00:55:15,184
Merry Christmas.
Good night, Father.

889
00:55:16,789 --> 00:55:18,890
Let's get ready for bed.
Santa's almost here.

890
00:55:18,891 --> 00:55:20,324
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

891
00:55:34,842 --> 00:55:36,809
Murray, look! Santa came!

892
00:55:37,645 --> 00:55:39,145
Santa drank the milk!

893
00:55:39,146 --> 00:55:40,579
Look! Look! Look!

894
00:55:40,681 --> 00:55:41,981
Santa came!

895
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:45,019
Come on!

896
00:55:46,087 --> 00:55:48,088
- Presents!
- I saw them! No!

897
00:55:48,089 --> 00:55:50,224
Stop it. We have to
wake up mom first.

898
00:55:50,225 --> 00:55:51,525
Come on.

899
00:55:51,628 --> 00:55:52,928
Mom! Mom! Mom!

900
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:54,730
Ok! Ok!

901
00:55:55,231 --> 00:55:56,531
Mom! Mom! Mom!

902
00:56:02,807 --> 00:56:04,107
Where's mine?

903
00:56:04,608 --> 00:56:07,175
Yeah, where's mine?
Where's mine?

904
00:56:07,411 --> 00:56:08,711
Oh! Santa came!

905
00:56:11,483 --> 00:56:13,050
Here. I found mine.

906
00:56:17,956 --> 00:56:19,256
Oh, Lynn.

907
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:22,360
Thanks.

908
00:56:22,695 --> 00:56:24,995
I wonder why this is so heavy.

909
00:56:28,234 --> 00:56:29,534
Ready?

910
00:56:30,003 --> 00:56:31,303
One...

911
00:56:32,339 --> 00:56:33,639
Two...

912
00:56:33,941 --> 00:56:35,241
Three!

913
00:56:36,209 --> 00:56:37,509
Save the paper.

914
00:56:38,613 --> 00:56:39,913
Why?

915
00:56:44,052 --> 00:56:46,085
I bet I know what this is.

916
00:57:17,255 --> 00:57:18,555
Oh, Lynn!

917
00:57:21,593 --> 00:57:23,760
Did you make these yourself?

918
00:57:42,768 --> 00:57:44,068
What's wrong?

919
00:57:49,041 --> 00:57:51,275
They're presents for our house.

920
00:57:51,276 --> 00:57:53,576
Remember?
We talked about it.

921
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,633
This is not a house.

922
00:58:07,477 --> 00:58:09,244
This is not Christmas.

923
00:58:12,717 --> 00:58:14,284
We live in a shack.

924
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,020
A shack!

925
00:58:18,423 --> 00:58:20,523
We have nothing of our own.

926
00:58:22,444 --> 00:58:25,680
Everything we did have, we either
sold it or left it behind...

927
00:58:25,681 --> 00:58:27,048
we have nothing!

928
00:58:27,416 --> 00:58:29,318
It's supposed to be
Christmas, goddamn it!

929
00:58:29,319 --> 00:58:30,619
It's Christmas!

930
00:58:31,121 --> 00:58:34,354
You watch your mouth,
Shayne Patrick Lacey.

931
00:58:35,158 --> 00:58:37,058
Well, I like what I got.

932
00:58:40,014 --> 00:58:42,914
All that money we earned,
and nothing.

933
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:48,122
You're mad 'cause you didn't
get a stupid t-shirt.

934
00:58:48,123 --> 00:58:49,490
Shut up, Murray!

935
00:58:52,928 --> 00:58:55,262
All they wanted was
some toys or a radio...

936
00:58:55,263 --> 00:58:56,563
you know what?

937
00:58:57,399 --> 00:59:01,903
You care more about this stupid
shack or this stupid house idea

938
00:59:01,904 --> 00:59:04,071
than you do about any of us!

939
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,580
Go get your father's belt.

940
00:59:17,889 --> 00:59:19,189
Go get it.

941
00:59:49,474 --> 00:59:50,774
I'll get it.

942
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:56,280
Ooh. Merry Christmas.

943
00:59:57,015 --> 00:59:58,448
I was going to...

944
01:00:03,257 --> 01:00:05,357
Merry Christmas,
Mr. Moon.

945
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:23,544
I know you had told me
not to bring any presents,

946
01:00:23,545 --> 01:00:24,845
but...

947
01:00:25,481 --> 01:00:27,248
This is for the house.

948
01:00:32,855 --> 01:00:35,555
Uh, Lynn,
get Mr. Moon his present.

949
01:00:37,844 --> 01:00:39,144
It's a mailbox.

950
01:00:42,917 --> 01:00:45,018
We got the spelling off
the contract,

951
01:00:45,019 --> 01:00:47,586
and Shayne made it
in shop class.

952
01:00:47,588 --> 01:00:48,888
Yes. Thank you.

953
01:00:52,727 --> 01:00:54,027
What is this?

954
01:00:54,162 --> 01:00:55,462
Plans.

955
01:00:57,266 --> 01:00:59,935
The blueprints for
the rest of this house.

956
01:00:59,936 --> 01:01:02,036
It's not like your picture.

957
01:01:02,104 --> 01:01:04,172
It's one-story ranch
with 2 bedrooms,

958
01:01:04,173 --> 01:01:05,874
but that can be changed.

959
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:07,775
It's a good, solid plan.

960
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:19,238
I really appreciate it,
Mr. Moon,

961
01:01:20,074 --> 01:01:23,107
but we're set on
building our own house.

962
01:01:23,812 --> 01:01:25,179
Merry Christmas.

963
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,487
You...

964
01:01:33,989 --> 01:01:36,556
Are a stubborn woman,
Mrs. Lacey.

965
01:01:48,439 --> 01:01:50,139
What's wrong in here?

966
01:01:52,043 --> 01:01:53,743
Santa Claus hates me.

967
01:02:02,672 --> 01:02:03,972
Mr. Moon...

968
01:02:06,475 --> 01:02:07,843
Could you give me
a ride into town?

969
01:02:07,844 --> 01:02:09,144
Yes, ma'am.

970
01:02:09,345 --> 01:02:11,378
I'll be ready in a minute.

971
01:02:12,049 --> 01:02:14,282
I'll be warming up the truck.

972
01:02:32,905 --> 01:02:34,272
Merry Christmas.

973
01:02:35,107 --> 01:02:37,807
- Happy new year.
- Happy new year.

974
01:02:39,611 --> 01:02:41,244
Thank you very much,

975
01:02:41,281 --> 01:02:43,514
and a Merry Christmas to you.

976
01:02:44,651 --> 01:02:46,068
Excuse me, Father.

977
01:02:46,069 --> 01:02:47,369
Oh, Mrs. Lacey.

978
01:02:47,838 --> 01:02:49,639
I certainly didn't
expect to see you here.

979
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,473
Well, actually, Father,

980
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:54,477
I was hoping to take you up
on your offer.

981
01:02:54,478 --> 01:02:57,147
Would you have any
of those presents left?

982
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:58,981
Uh, I took your advice.

983
01:02:59,084 --> 01:03:01,851
I gave them
to a truly needy family.

984
01:03:02,021 --> 01:03:03,721
So you have no gifts?

985
01:03:04,589 --> 01:03:05,889
You know,

986
01:03:06,292 --> 01:03:08,360
the best gift
that you could give them,

987
01:03:08,361 --> 01:03:11,528
would be to bring them
all here to church.

988
01:03:12,699 --> 01:03:14,749
Father Tomlin,
that was wonderful.

989
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:16,785
Thank you. I greatly
enjoyed that sermon.

990
01:03:16,786 --> 01:03:18,753
I have money.
I can pay.

991
01:03:18,855 --> 01:03:20,656
I'm... I'm sorry,
Mrs. Lacey.

992
01:03:20,657 --> 01:03:23,024
We... we have none.
I'm sorry.

993
01:03:41,614 --> 01:03:43,714
Is it warm enough in there?

994
01:03:44,217 --> 01:03:45,517
Warm enough.

995
01:03:46,853 --> 01:03:50,353
Why didn't you finish
this place, Mr. Munimura?

996
01:03:50,624 --> 01:03:52,524
I started it for my boy.

997
01:03:53,293 --> 01:03:55,060
He went into the Navy.

998
01:03:55,363 --> 01:03:56,796
He was a pilot...

999
01:03:56,897 --> 01:03:58,197
Flew jet.

1000
01:04:00,118 --> 01:04:03,218
Married a nice Japanese
girl from Hawaii.

1001
01:04:04,056 --> 01:04:05,657
They were going to move here

1002
01:04:05,658 --> 01:04:07,691
after their tour in Korea.

1003
01:04:08,027 --> 01:04:09,460
Munimura and son.

1004
01:04:13,066 --> 01:04:14,366
Korea...

1005
01:04:16,336 --> 01:04:17,903
He wanted to fight.

1006
01:04:19,406 --> 01:04:21,239
Michael wanted to prove

1007
01:04:21,374 --> 01:04:24,007
he was as American
as anyone else.

1008
01:04:24,579 --> 01:04:27,079
Chieko and I started this place.

1009
01:04:27,782 --> 01:04:30,082
It was going to be a surprise.

1010
01:04:31,218 --> 01:04:32,851
He didn't come back.

1011
01:04:33,722 --> 01:04:36,089
His wife went on with her life.

1012
01:04:36,625 --> 01:04:38,658
Chieko died the next year.

1013
01:04:47,704 --> 01:04:49,471
I'm sorry about the blueprints.

1014
01:04:49,472 --> 01:04:50,941
I shouldn't have said that.

1015
01:04:50,942 --> 01:04:53,042
I didn't even look at them.

1016
01:04:53,844 --> 01:04:55,144
No, no.

1017
01:04:55,479 --> 01:04:58,347
You have a right
to your kind of house.

1018
01:04:58,348 --> 01:05:00,250
Chieko and I started this place

1019
01:05:00,251 --> 01:05:03,018
so there'd be a family
someday here.

1020
01:05:03,989 --> 01:05:06,857
You and your tribe are
more than Chieko hoped for

1021
01:05:06,858 --> 01:05:09,491
as far as the number
is concerned,

1022
01:05:10,563 --> 01:05:13,632
but you saw something here
the day you drove up

1023
01:05:13,633 --> 01:05:15,800
in that rattletrap Plymouth.

1024
01:05:16,869 --> 01:05:18,902
Don't forget what you saw.

1025
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:30,749
Merry Christmas,
Mr. Munimura.

1026
01:05:33,655 --> 01:05:35,888
Merry Christmas,
Mrs. Lacey.

1027
01:05:58,732 --> 01:06:00,032
Mama...

1028
01:06:01,002 --> 01:06:03,069
You didn't open the rest
of your presents.

1029
01:06:03,070 --> 01:06:04,370
Tomorrow.

1030
01:06:04,506 --> 01:06:06,206
Mama, come over here.

1031
01:06:06,408 --> 01:06:07,841
I got to finish the dishes.

1032
01:06:07,842 --> 01:06:10,409
Come on.
No, I mean it. I got to.

1033
01:06:22,392 --> 01:06:23,959
Oh, good. They fit.

1034
01:06:23,994 --> 01:06:25,294
Oh, good.

1035
01:06:28,665 --> 01:06:30,432
Oh, God, I'm so tired.

1036
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:36,072
I'm just so damn tired.

1037
01:06:38,709 --> 01:06:41,409
W-well, maybe
you should go to bed.

1038
01:06:46,152 --> 01:06:48,319
It's not that kind of tired.

1039
01:06:51,558 --> 01:06:54,058
Sometimes I don't think I can...

1040
01:06:58,999 --> 01:07:00,499
I feel like I'm...

1041
01:07:01,369 --> 01:07:03,202
Pushing a car uphill...

1042
01:07:04,505 --> 01:07:06,639
a... a big car
like our Plymouth...

1043
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,007
up a steep hill,

1044
01:07:08,242 --> 01:07:10,278
and I'm... I'm pushing
and pushing,

1045
01:07:10,279 --> 01:07:12,979
and... and I push,
and I look down,

1046
01:07:13,015 --> 01:07:15,083
and I can see
the ground under my feet,

1047
01:07:15,084 --> 01:07:17,185
and then I look up,
and I can see all you,

1048
01:07:17,186 --> 01:07:18,988
kids in the back seat.
Looking at me,

1049
01:07:18,989 --> 01:07:20,956
and... and I'm pushing...

1050
01:07:25,195 --> 01:07:27,628
But, mama, we're not in the car.

1051
01:07:29,066 --> 01:07:30,899
We're helping you push.

1052
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:34,970
Yeah.

1053
01:07:37,108 --> 01:07:38,408
Yeah, you are.

1054
01:07:40,312 --> 01:07:41,679
Of course, mama.

1055
01:07:41,813 --> 01:07:43,580
We're the Lacey tribe.

1056
01:07:45,217 --> 01:07:48,917
It just feels like you're
pushing alone sometimes.

1057
01:07:50,390 --> 01:07:51,656
Here.

1058
01:07:51,657 --> 01:07:53,157
You open this one.

1059
01:08:11,396 --> 01:08:13,563
That's from Annie and Craig.

1060
01:08:14,232 --> 01:08:16,465
We helped, but just a little.

1061
01:08:40,478 --> 01:08:41,778
Look at that.

1062
01:08:43,215 --> 01:08:45,315
It was a long, long winter.

1063
01:08:46,251 --> 01:08:48,618
Mama and I were still fighting,

1064
01:08:48,754 --> 01:08:51,623
and being cooped up
in that shack didn't help.

1065
01:08:51,624 --> 01:08:53,458
There wasn't anything to do

1066
01:08:53,459 --> 01:08:54,959
or anywhere to go.

1067
01:09:19,704 --> 01:09:20,839
I like that one.

1068
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,873
That's mine.
That's mine.

1069
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:24,475
Look at that.

1070
01:09:24,476 --> 01:09:25,544
That looks...

1071
01:09:25,545 --> 01:09:26,912
oh! Look at that one.

1072
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:28,213
Hello.

1073
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:29,949
Hi, kids.

1074
01:09:29,950 --> 01:09:31,250
Hi, mom.

1075
01:09:31,618 --> 01:09:33,118
- Hi, mom.
- Hi, mom.

1076
01:09:33,754 --> 01:09:35,521
Oh, what a pretty picture.

1077
01:09:35,522 --> 01:09:36,689
Did you paint that?
Hmm-mm.

1078
01:09:36,690 --> 01:09:37,990
Who is that?

1079
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,394
That's you, that's
Craig, that's Shayne,

1080
01:09:41,395 --> 01:09:43,962
and that's me,
and that's Murray.

1081
01:09:45,033 --> 01:09:46,733
Hey...
What is this?

1082
01:09:48,037 --> 01:09:49,437
What the hell are you doing,

1083
01:09:49,438 --> 01:09:50,738
you little snot, huh?

1084
01:09:50,739 --> 01:09:51,756
Shayne, watch it.

1085
01:09:51,757 --> 01:09:53,657
This is my history book.

1086
01:09:53,793 --> 01:09:55,259
You've ruined my book.

1087
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:56,093
Who cares?

1088
01:09:56,094 --> 01:09:57,394
It's pretty.

1089
01:09:57,698 --> 01:09:59,665
You draw in it every day.

1090
01:09:59,933 --> 01:10:01,500
Yeah.
Naked women.

1091
01:10:01,501 --> 01:10:03,801
Shut up!
I'll smack you both!

1092
01:10:04,153 --> 01:10:05,888
Shayne Patrick,
watch your mouth.

1093
01:10:05,889 --> 01:10:07,189
Wait a minute.

1094
01:10:08,225 --> 01:10:09,858
Where's my homework?

1095
01:10:09,894 --> 01:10:11,194
Huh?

1096
01:10:11,195 --> 01:10:12,628
Where is it? Huh?

1097
01:10:12,797 --> 01:10:14,197
Shayne, I'm warning you.

1098
01:10:14,198 --> 01:10:15,498
I don't know!

1099
01:10:16,001 --> 01:10:17,434
Tell me! Tell me!

1100
01:10:18,036 --> 01:10:19,169
Get your father's belt.

1101
01:10:19,170 --> 01:10:20,537
Get it yourself.

1102
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:27,010
No, mama.
Please, mama.

1103
01:10:27,947 --> 01:10:30,281
Listen to me.
When are you going to listen?

1104
01:10:30,282 --> 01:10:31,516
Stop it.
You're hurting me.

1105
01:10:31,517 --> 01:10:32,817
Stop it, mama!

1106
01:10:34,253 --> 01:10:35,553
Mama!

1107
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:36,956
Stop it!

1108
01:10:36,957 --> 01:10:38,657
Stop it, mama!
Stop!

1109
01:10:38,959 --> 01:10:40,259
Stop, please.

1110
01:10:59,048 --> 01:11:01,148
I didn't speak to my mother

1111
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:03,252
or look her in the eye
for 5 days

1112
01:11:03,253 --> 01:11:05,755
after she took
my dad's belt to me.

1113
01:11:05,756 --> 01:11:08,056
I didn't think she even cared.

1114
01:11:40,795 --> 01:11:42,962
You and I remember him best.

1115
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:48,100
Craig and Annie are too young.

1116
01:11:56,227 --> 01:11:58,327
Do you ever get mad at him?

1117
01:11:59,766 --> 01:12:01,066
What...

1118
01:12:02,502 --> 01:12:04,469
For leaving us like this?

1119
01:12:05,538 --> 01:12:06,838
Sometimes.

1120
01:12:10,878 --> 01:12:14,778
I get mad at him for a whole
bushel basket of things,

1121
01:12:16,016 --> 01:12:18,049
but you can't really blame

1122
01:12:18,119 --> 01:12:20,159
that goddamn vagabond, Irish
Catholic son of a bitch

1123
01:12:20,183 --> 01:12:21,750
for dying, can you?

1124
01:12:23,558 --> 01:12:24,858
No.

1125
01:12:28,998 --> 01:12:30,298
Just...

1126
01:12:31,968 --> 01:12:35,535
Sometimes I wish things
were a little different.

1127
01:12:41,194 --> 01:12:44,361
You don't want to be
the man of the house.

1128
01:12:45,133 --> 01:12:47,334
I know what you have to give up,

1129
01:12:47,335 --> 01:12:49,169
the things you can't do
at school.

1130
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:50,703
You don't have any friends.

1131
01:12:50,704 --> 01:12:52,737
You have responsibilities.

1132
01:12:56,011 --> 01:12:58,978
I was a kid myself
once, too, you know.

1133
01:13:03,035 --> 01:13:05,668
Wanted to go to parties,
have fun,

1134
01:13:05,738 --> 01:13:08,573
dance my life away,
dance with all the boys,

1135
01:13:08,574 --> 01:13:10,674
neck until the sun came up,

1136
01:13:10,743 --> 01:13:12,576
but this is what I got.

1137
01:13:16,333 --> 01:13:18,700
This is what happens sometimes.

1138
01:13:29,898 --> 01:13:31,998
You work with what you get,

1139
01:13:32,368 --> 01:13:34,668
and you try to make it better.

1140
01:14:02,251 --> 01:14:03,918
I'll pick you up
around 3:00.

1141
01:14:03,919 --> 01:14:05,219
Thanks. See ya.

1142
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:28,979
Mom, it's cold.

1143
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:30,147
Are you ok?

1144
01:14:30,148 --> 01:14:31,448
Yeah.

1145
01:14:33,385 --> 01:14:35,485
It's going to be beautiful.

1146
01:14:36,354 --> 01:14:38,924
We'll finish the first
floor this summer.

1147
01:14:38,925 --> 01:14:41,092
We'll do some exterior work,

1148
01:14:41,193 --> 01:14:44,496
then next year we'll start
on the second floor.

1149
01:14:44,497 --> 01:14:46,530
You'll have your own room.

1150
01:14:47,701 --> 01:14:51,003
It's going to be all
buttoned up and beautiful.

1151
01:14:51,004 --> 01:14:52,304
Yeah.

1152
01:14:53,574 --> 01:14:54,874
Mom...

1153
01:14:56,344 --> 01:14:57,511
Can I ask you a question?

1154
01:14:57,512 --> 01:14:58,812
Hmm?

1155
01:14:59,815 --> 01:15:01,382
Can I go on a date?

1156
01:15:02,383 --> 01:15:03,683
Sure.

1157
01:15:03,885 --> 01:15:05,185
I can?

1158
01:15:05,888 --> 01:15:07,589
I've been known to go on a date

1159
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:09,324
once or twice myself, you know.

1160
01:15:09,325 --> 01:15:10,625
Really?

1161
01:15:13,529 --> 01:15:14,829
Mom...

1162
01:15:17,334 --> 01:15:18,634
I'm sorry.

1163
01:15:21,404 --> 01:15:23,971
I'm sorry about
being mad at you.

1164
01:15:24,241 --> 01:15:27,008
You know, for going
to dinner and...

1165
01:15:27,445 --> 01:15:29,012
Going on that date.

1166
01:15:35,087 --> 01:15:37,021
Mama went all out
for the occasion.

1167
01:15:37,022 --> 01:15:38,656
We went to the thrift shop

1168
01:15:38,657 --> 01:15:41,693
and picked out a jacket,
slacks, shoes...

1169
01:15:41,694 --> 01:15:44,530
They were used, but they
were the best I ever had.

1170
01:15:44,531 --> 01:15:45,931
You look nice, Shayne.

1171
01:15:45,932 --> 01:15:47,365
Oh, thanks, Faye.

1172
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:52,737
You going to squeeze
her boobies?

1173
01:15:54,142 --> 01:15:55,908
All right. I'll get you.

1174
01:15:55,909 --> 01:15:58,111
I'll get daddy's belt on you.

1175
01:15:58,112 --> 01:15:59,412
You boys.

1176
01:16:01,733 --> 01:16:03,700
Oh, mom.
You look great.

1177
01:16:04,987 --> 01:16:06,487
- Really?
- Yeah.

1178
01:16:06,855 --> 01:16:08,155
You look really nice.

1179
01:16:08,156 --> 01:16:09,789
Look at you, Shayne.

1180
01:16:09,826 --> 01:16:11,359
Ain't he a handsome devil?

1181
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,861
Looks just like his father,

1182
01:16:12,862 --> 01:16:14,530
that goddamn vagabond...

1183
01:16:14,531 --> 01:16:16,831
Irish Catholic son of a bitch.

1184
01:16:18,868 --> 01:16:20,436
Are you going to
the dance with Shayne?

1185
01:16:20,437 --> 01:16:21,937
I got my own date.

1186
01:16:27,477 --> 01:16:28,777
That's them.

1187
01:16:30,281 --> 01:16:33,781
You'll never get a date,
Murray, you stink bug.

1188
01:16:34,953 --> 01:16:36,786
- Are you excited?
- Yeah.

1189
01:16:36,821 --> 01:16:38,588
- I'm nervous.
- Are you?

1190
01:16:39,091 --> 01:16:41,324
Here.
Don't tell the others.

1191
01:16:41,594 --> 01:16:43,194
I knew what that money
meant to mama...

1192
01:16:43,195 --> 01:16:44,628
And to our house.

1193
01:16:45,798 --> 01:16:47,831
- Bye, Shayne.
- Bye, Shayne.

1194
01:16:47,968 --> 01:16:49,335
- Bye, mama.
- Bye.

1195
01:16:49,636 --> 01:16:50,502
Good luck on your date.

1196
01:16:50,503 --> 01:16:51,803
Ok.

1197
01:16:52,338 --> 01:16:53,839
That dollar meant more to me,

1198
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:56,207
than anything she ever gave me.

1199
01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:07,789
You never forget
your first real date.

1200
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:09,523
I didn't know how to dance,

1201
01:17:09,524 --> 01:17:12,891
much less how to ask a girl
to dance with me.

1202
01:17:13,395 --> 01:17:16,131
It sure was different
than practicing with mama,

1203
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:18,967
but I had the first,
best time of my life.

1204
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:20,735
"Oh, don't you know?"

1205
01:17:21,504 --> 01:17:24,271
"don't you know
you'll be my fool?"

1206
01:17:25,710 --> 01:17:27,343
"you got me cryin'"

1207
01:17:29,113 --> 01:17:30,413
"cryin' again"

1208
01:17:33,183 --> 01:17:36,216
"when will you let
this heartache end?"

1209
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:40,140
"emotion"

1210
01:17:42,544 --> 01:17:44,311
"you gave me up then"

1211
01:17:46,949 --> 01:17:48,782
"why make me remember"

1212
01:17:50,386 --> 01:17:52,219
"what I wanna forget?"

1213
01:18:24,491 --> 01:18:25,758
May I have the pleasure?

1214
01:18:25,759 --> 01:18:27,059
Well, Norman.

1215
01:18:27,594 --> 01:18:28,994
Dance with me, Frances.

1216
01:18:28,995 --> 01:18:30,931
Well, let's go on inside.

1217
01:18:30,932 --> 01:18:32,499
It's cold out here.

1218
01:18:32,567 --> 01:18:35,000
Well, I'm a good
keeper-warmer.

1219
01:18:35,336 --> 01:18:36,703
- Norman...
- What?

1220
01:18:36,738 --> 01:18:38,573
Come on.
Let's go dance...

1221
01:18:38,574 --> 01:18:40,742
we're definitely kicking up
our heels tonight, but...

1222
01:18:40,743 --> 01:18:42,043
- After.
- After?

1223
01:18:42,845 --> 01:18:44,145
What is this?

1224
01:18:44,246 --> 01:18:46,413
This is the key to paradise.

1225
01:18:47,015 --> 01:18:48,484
You're presuming a bit,
aren't you?

1226
01:18:48,485 --> 01:18:49,918
I don't think so.

1227
01:18:50,286 --> 01:18:52,455
You're free, white, and
more than a nod past 21.

1228
01:18:52,456 --> 01:18:54,557
- Thanks a lot.
- Yeah, we both are.

1229
01:18:54,558 --> 01:18:56,692
We'll get it out of the way.

1230
01:18:56,693 --> 01:19:00,597
Save some awkwardness, and we
don't smell like cigarette smoke.

1231
01:19:00,598 --> 01:19:03,498
'Sides, I drink too much
when I dance,

1232
01:19:04,234 --> 01:19:06,436
and I ain't worth
a shit in the sack then.

1233
01:19:06,437 --> 01:19:07,872
Well, that's romantic
as all hell.

1234
01:19:07,873 --> 01:19:09,273
Look, it's paid for.

1235
01:19:09,274 --> 01:19:11,041
Why waste it? Come on.

1236
01:19:12,110 --> 01:19:13,878
Hey, what are you doing?

1237
01:19:13,879 --> 01:19:15,848
Either we go dancing
or take me home.

1238
01:19:15,849 --> 01:19:16,982
Oh! Don't act
like no virgin.

1239
01:19:16,983 --> 01:19:18,283
What?

1240
01:19:18,885 --> 01:19:21,487
A woman with six kids
has been around the block.

1241
01:19:21,488 --> 01:19:23,388
I don't roll on my back,

1242
01:19:23,456 --> 01:19:25,725
for every asshole
who scratches my belly.

1243
01:19:25,726 --> 01:19:28,027
You ought to. Not many
guys will make this offer.

1244
01:19:28,028 --> 01:19:29,629
I should be so lucky.

1245
01:19:29,630 --> 01:19:30,930
Come on, honey.

1246
01:19:31,499 --> 01:19:32,799
Let go of me!

1247
01:19:33,584 --> 01:19:35,652
Take your hand off me.
Take your hand off me.

1248
01:19:35,653 --> 01:19:36,953
Settle down.

1249
01:19:37,421 --> 01:19:39,389
This isn't going to happen.

1250
01:19:39,390 --> 01:19:41,691
Are we going to stand here
until the snow comes again?

1251
01:19:41,692 --> 01:19:42,992
Let go!

1252
01:19:43,228 --> 01:19:45,195
Don't tell me what to do!

1253
01:19:45,297 --> 01:19:46,397
I could make you.

1254
01:19:46,398 --> 01:19:47,698
You could try.

1255
01:19:53,940 --> 01:19:55,907
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

1256
01:19:58,044 --> 01:20:00,112
Come on.
Will you get out of there?

1257
01:20:00,113 --> 01:20:02,480
You're steaming up the windows.

1258
01:20:02,984 --> 01:20:04,284
Hey, guys.

1259
01:20:04,652 --> 01:20:05,952
Let's go.

1260
01:20:10,691 --> 01:20:11,991
Ha ha ha.

1261
01:20:12,394 --> 01:20:14,361
"Since I first met you."

1262
01:20:18,466 --> 01:20:19,766
"I pray..."

1263
01:20:22,872 --> 01:20:24,306
See you, lover boy.

1264
01:20:24,307 --> 01:20:25,607
Bye, Raymi.

1265
01:20:52,672 --> 01:20:54,072
Hey, mom, what you doing?

1266
01:20:54,073 --> 01:20:55,373
Sitting.

1267
01:20:56,208 --> 01:20:57,508
Go on in.

1268
01:20:57,610 --> 01:20:59,443
I'll be in in a minute.

1269
01:20:59,479 --> 01:21:00,979
- Are you ok?
- Yeah.

1270
01:21:01,314 --> 01:21:02,614
I'm fine.

1271
01:21:04,785 --> 01:21:06,285
How was your date?

1272
01:21:07,254 --> 01:21:08,687
It was all right.

1273
01:21:09,390 --> 01:21:10,690
How was yours?

1274
01:21:13,394 --> 01:21:14,694
Mom?

1275
01:21:16,064 --> 01:21:17,364
Mom?

1276
01:21:20,185 --> 01:21:21,485
What happened?

1277
01:21:26,126 --> 01:21:28,759
I just made a mistake,
that's all.

1278
01:21:32,716 --> 01:21:34,449
I don't know what it is,

1279
01:21:34,450 --> 01:21:36,153
but if there's a son of a bitch

1280
01:21:36,154 --> 01:21:38,321
within 70 Miles, he'll find me.

1281
01:21:38,322 --> 01:21:41,089
Been that way
since your daddy died.

1282
01:21:42,259 --> 01:21:43,626
Any horse's ass.

1283
01:21:44,963 --> 01:21:47,065
I just walk right up
to him and s-say,

1284
01:21:47,066 --> 01:21:49,033
"here I am, you asshole."

1285
01:21:49,301 --> 01:21:52,534
"Why don't you chew me up
and spit me out?"

1286
01:21:53,271 --> 01:21:54,571
Mom, I'm sorry.

1287
01:21:57,210 --> 01:21:59,110
It's going to be ok, ok?

1288
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,380
I promise.

1289
01:22:03,650 --> 01:22:06,483
Honey, it's not your
fault, it's his.

1290
01:22:06,987 --> 01:22:08,620
Now go on, will you?

1291
01:22:10,925 --> 01:22:12,892
It's going to be ok, mom.

1292
01:22:16,164 --> 01:22:17,464
Come on.

1293
01:22:18,366 --> 01:22:20,466
It's going to be all right.

1294
01:22:35,419 --> 01:22:36,752
Was dad ever mean to you?

1295
01:22:36,753 --> 01:22:38,053
No.

1296
01:22:39,889 --> 01:22:42,456
He was the finest man
I ever met.

1297
01:22:43,794 --> 01:22:45,894
He treated me like a queen.

1298
01:22:47,898 --> 01:22:50,131
Promise me something, Shayne.

1299
01:22:52,804 --> 01:22:55,607
Promise me you'll never
beat on a woman.

1300
01:22:55,608 --> 01:22:56,975
Yeah, I promise.

1301
01:22:57,510 --> 01:22:59,277
Never beat on anybody.

1302
01:23:00,113 --> 01:23:01,413
It hurts,

1303
01:23:01,648 --> 01:23:02,948
inside and out.

1304
01:23:06,653 --> 01:23:07,953
Yeah.

1305
01:23:08,856 --> 01:23:10,156
I know it does.

1306
01:23:17,298 --> 01:23:18,598
Go to bed.

1307
01:23:18,733 --> 01:23:20,000
But...

1308
01:23:20,001 --> 01:23:21,301
please.

1309
01:23:22,704 --> 01:23:24,004
Go to bed.

1310
01:23:46,764 --> 01:23:48,064
What is it?

1311
01:23:53,672 --> 01:23:55,505
Annie.
Annie, wake up.

1312
01:24:35,886 --> 01:24:36,986
Are you all right?

1313
01:24:36,987 --> 01:24:38,287
All right.

1314
01:24:39,522 --> 01:24:41,023
You look beautiful today.

1315
01:24:41,024 --> 01:24:42,759
You mind me saying that?

1316
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:44,627
It's true.
You really do.

1317
01:24:44,628 --> 01:24:46,562
Now... This spot
down here...

1318
01:24:46,563 --> 01:24:47,863
Ok.

1319
01:24:50,401 --> 01:24:51,701
Uhh!

1320
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:54,471
Aah!

1321
01:24:59,945 --> 01:25:01,445
You hit my mother!

1322
01:25:02,965 --> 01:25:04,032
Aah!

1323
01:25:04,033 --> 01:25:05,333
Oh!

1324
01:25:06,118 --> 01:25:07,818
Crazy little bastard.

1325
01:25:11,958 --> 01:25:13,391
Call the sheriff!

1326
01:25:13,693 --> 01:25:14,993
Somebody!

1327
01:25:16,063 --> 01:25:17,363
Aah!

1328
01:25:18,332 --> 01:25:20,299
Say you did it!
Come on!

1329
01:25:20,835 --> 01:25:23,268
Say you did it!
Say you did it!

1330
01:25:24,306 --> 01:25:26,206
Say you...
say you did it!

1331
01:25:26,207 --> 01:25:27,507
Say it!

1332
01:25:27,542 --> 01:25:28,975
Say it now!
Now!

1333
01:25:29,312 --> 01:25:30,945
I never touched her!

1334
01:25:31,347 --> 01:25:33,514
Where'd you get the scratch?

1335
01:25:33,516 --> 01:25:35,517
'Cause she fights
just like you do.

1336
01:25:35,518 --> 01:25:36,818
Ohh!

1337
01:25:41,891 --> 01:25:43,191
Ohh...

1338
01:25:44,294 --> 01:25:45,594
Uhh...

1339
01:26:10,056 --> 01:26:11,689
- Mr. hilliard.
- Yeah.

1340
01:26:11,924 --> 01:26:13,444
Can I talk to you
for a minute, please?

1341
01:26:13,468 --> 01:26:14,768
Sure.

1342
01:26:16,763 --> 01:26:18,063
Um...

1343
01:26:21,835 --> 01:26:23,868
I can't work here anymore.

1344
01:26:23,937 --> 01:26:25,237
Why?

1345
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:27,674
I quit. I can't work
here with Norman,

1346
01:26:27,675 --> 01:26:30,175
not after what he did to my boy.

1347
01:26:32,381 --> 01:26:34,749
Uh-huh. Well, Norman
doesn't work here anymore.

1348
01:26:34,750 --> 01:26:36,050
I let him go.

1349
01:26:40,156 --> 01:26:41,456
Really?

1350
01:26:42,125 --> 01:26:43,425
Yeah, really.

1351
01:26:45,795 --> 01:26:47,895
So if Norman's the problem,

1352
01:26:48,165 --> 01:26:50,665
you really don't have a problem.

1353
01:26:55,140 --> 01:26:56,907
And listen, Frances...

1354
01:26:59,010 --> 01:27:01,377
Why don't you take the day off?

1355
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:04,380
And I'll see you in the morning.

1356
01:27:05,351 --> 01:27:06,651
Ok?

1357
01:27:08,087 --> 01:27:09,920
Things will get better.

1358
01:27:10,857 --> 01:27:12,157
You'll see.

1359
01:27:38,003 --> 01:27:41,503
Lacey tribe, may I have
your attention, please?

1360
01:27:41,607 --> 01:27:43,508
What do you want, Murray?

1361
01:27:43,509 --> 01:27:46,009
Just come here.
It's a surprise.

1362
01:27:46,278 --> 01:27:47,578
Too busy.

1363
01:27:47,647 --> 01:27:49,682
You're never too busy for this.

1364
01:27:49,683 --> 01:27:51,016
Come on, hurry up.

1365
01:27:51,017 --> 01:27:52,317
Yeah, hurry up.

1366
01:27:54,488 --> 01:27:55,788
One...

1367
01:27:56,974 --> 01:27:58,274
Two...

1368
01:27:59,010 --> 01:28:00,310
Three!

1369
01:28:01,279 --> 01:28:02,579
Aah! Ha ha!

1370
01:28:05,016 --> 01:28:07,251
Lacey tribe!
We're coming up in the world!

1371
01:28:07,252 --> 01:28:09,988
Indoor plumbing.
Who gets the first turn?

1372
01:28:09,989 --> 01:28:11,689
- Ooh, I do.
- I do.

1373
01:28:11,724 --> 01:28:13,024
I do.

1374
01:29:00,327 --> 01:29:01,627
Craig! Shayne!

1375
01:29:02,229 --> 01:29:03,230
Come down here!

1376
01:29:03,231 --> 01:29:04,531
Murray!

1377
01:29:09,104 --> 01:29:10,404
Come on!

1378
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:16,160
Bye, outhouse!
Yeah!

1379
01:29:16,663 --> 01:29:18,763
Murray, what are you doing?

1380
01:29:19,131 --> 01:29:20,431
Dirty.

1381
01:29:22,436 --> 01:29:23,770
Ok, this is dirty.

1382
01:29:23,771 --> 01:29:25,071
Clean.

1383
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:30,073
Annie, look at this spot.
It's dirty.

1384
01:29:31,546 --> 01:29:33,713
Whoopee-doo.
A little spot.

1385
01:29:35,917 --> 01:29:37,685
Look at that thing burn.

1386
01:29:37,686 --> 01:29:38,785
Yeah!

1387
01:29:38,786 --> 01:29:40,086
Yeah, cool!

1388
01:29:40,739 --> 01:29:42,039
Great!

1389
01:29:42,441 --> 01:29:44,341
Look at that thing burn!

1390
01:29:44,694 --> 01:29:45,994
Hanky.

1391
01:29:52,085 --> 01:29:53,252
All right!

1392
01:29:53,253 --> 01:29:54,353
- Yeah!
- Yay!

1393
01:29:54,354 --> 01:29:55,654
Yeah!

1394
01:29:57,390 --> 01:30:00,126
I don't have to go to that
stinking outhouse anymore!

1395
01:30:00,127 --> 01:30:01,827
I hate that outhouse!

1396
01:30:02,596 --> 01:30:03,896
What?

1397
01:30:04,198 --> 01:30:05,498
It's burning!

1398
01:30:05,917 --> 01:30:08,219
Craig, Annie,
go to Mr. Moon's!

1399
01:30:08,220 --> 01:30:09,988
Get him to call the
fire department! Go!

1400
01:30:09,989 --> 01:30:11,222
Hurry!

1401
01:30:11,223 --> 01:30:12,590
Murray, come on!

1402
01:30:16,578 --> 01:30:17,945
Come on, Murray!

1403
01:30:18,915 --> 01:30:20,215
Come on!

1404
01:30:55,122 --> 01:30:56,255
It's frozen.

1405
01:30:56,256 --> 01:30:57,556
Aah!

1406
01:31:00,460 --> 01:31:01,327
The red dress.

1407
01:31:01,328 --> 01:31:02,594
With the white bows.

1408
01:31:02,595 --> 01:31:03,895
Good for you.

1409
01:31:04,065 --> 01:31:05,898
Matching lipstick, too.

1410
01:31:06,634 --> 01:31:08,068
Hey, look at that smoke.

1411
01:31:08,069 --> 01:31:09,369
Where?

1412
01:31:09,870 --> 01:31:11,590
Right there. Isn't that
close to your house?

1413
01:31:11,614 --> 01:31:12,914
Oh, my God.

1414
01:31:13,775 --> 01:31:16,142
I'm going to get the money jar.

1415
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:20,613
Boys, get down from the roof!

1416
01:31:29,426 --> 01:31:32,326
Murray, get out of here!
It's too hot!

1417
01:31:50,049 --> 01:31:51,349
Are you ok?

1418
01:31:51,584 --> 01:31:53,284
What happened?
I'm sorry, mama.

1419
01:31:53,285 --> 01:31:54,585
Are you ok?

1420
01:31:56,255 --> 01:31:57,555
Where's Lynn?

1421
01:31:57,924 --> 01:31:59,325
Mommy, Lynn went
back in the house!

1422
01:31:59,326 --> 01:31:59,993
She's in the house!

1423
01:31:59,994 --> 01:32:01,294
Lynn!

1424
01:32:01,561 --> 01:32:02,861
Lynn!

1425
01:32:03,831 --> 01:32:05,131
Lynn!

1426
01:32:07,234 --> 01:32:08,534
Lynn!

1427
01:32:08,903 --> 01:32:10,203
Lynn!

1428
01:32:10,722 --> 01:32:12,022
Lynn!

1429
01:32:13,491 --> 01:32:15,159
Mama, I couldn't find
the money jar.

1430
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:17,194
Doesn't matter.
Are you ok?

1431
01:32:17,195 --> 01:32:18,495
Got to find it.

1432
01:32:44,526 --> 01:32:46,260
By the time they got there,

1433
01:32:46,261 --> 01:32:48,846
there was nothing
the firemen could do.

1434
01:32:48,847 --> 01:32:51,082
I even remember
the way they put it...

1435
01:32:51,083 --> 01:32:53,783
"the structure
was fully consumed."

1436
01:33:05,516 --> 01:33:07,216
I think the less you have,

1437
01:33:07,217 --> 01:33:09,586
the more it hurts
when you lose it,

1438
01:33:09,587 --> 01:33:11,554
and that fire hurt a lot.

1439
01:33:56,205 --> 01:33:57,505
Murray.

1440
01:34:01,711 --> 01:34:03,011
Sorry, mama.

1441
01:34:04,882 --> 01:34:06,182
I'm so sorry.

1442
01:34:08,852 --> 01:34:10,152
Oh, honey...

1443
01:34:11,155 --> 01:34:12,788
It's not your fault.

1444
01:34:14,759 --> 01:34:16,059
Not your fault.

1445
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:18,727
I just burnt down our house.

1446
01:34:18,763 --> 01:34:20,031
Oh...

1447
01:34:20,032 --> 01:34:21,332
Listen.

1448
01:34:22,234 --> 01:34:23,801
It was an accident.

1449
01:34:25,304 --> 01:34:28,804
It was an accident, honey.
It's nobody's fault.

1450
01:34:28,942 --> 01:34:30,242
Oh, baby...

1451
01:34:31,378 --> 01:34:33,011
It's nobody's fault.

1452
01:34:42,856 --> 01:34:44,156
Come on.

1453
01:35:11,655 --> 01:35:12,955
Save the nails.

1454
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:17,260
Unh!

1455
01:35:17,261 --> 01:35:18,561
Ha ha!

1456
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:22,663
Oh. Lynn, everything's
going to be all right.

1457
01:35:23,668 --> 01:35:24,602
We can start over.

1458
01:35:24,603 --> 01:35:25,903
Ha ha!

1459
01:35:26,605 --> 01:35:30,124
Everything's going to be all
buttoned up and beautiful.

1460
01:35:30,125 --> 01:35:31,425
Bullshit!

1461
01:35:33,863 --> 01:35:35,998
Nothing's going to be all right.

1462
01:35:35,999 --> 01:35:38,032
You're only saying that...

1463
01:35:38,068 --> 01:35:40,301
"buttoned up
and beautiful."

1464
01:35:40,687 --> 01:35:42,321
Don't tell them that
if they're good,

1465
01:35:42,322 --> 01:35:43,823
everything will work out.

1466
01:35:43,824 --> 01:35:45,791
It doesn't work that way.

1467
01:35:47,762 --> 01:35:49,929
"Buttoned up and beautiful"?

1468
01:35:51,265 --> 01:35:53,298
You're always saying that!

1469
01:35:53,685 --> 01:35:56,304
And we believe it,
and it hurts us

1470
01:35:56,305 --> 01:35:59,057
every time we have
to hear it from you!

1471
01:35:59,058 --> 01:36:00,558
Don't lie to them!

1472
01:36:05,798 --> 01:36:08,831
I don't know what to
say to you, Shayne.

1473
01:36:10,370 --> 01:36:13,039
I don't know what
you want to hear.

1474
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:15,408
I guess you want a different
family, a different life.

1475
01:36:15,409 --> 01:36:16,976
Well, it isn't going to happen.

1476
01:36:16,977 --> 01:36:18,677
This is what you got.

1477
01:36:21,783 --> 01:36:24,651
You think I don't want
something more?

1478
01:36:24,652 --> 01:36:26,485
Life isn't fair, buddy.

1479
01:36:26,888 --> 01:36:29,521
Sometimes it's just
goddamn lousy.

1480
01:36:32,244 --> 01:36:34,079
You want to go back
to Los Angeles?

1481
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:36,580
Go on. We'll manage
without you.

1482
01:36:36,982 --> 01:36:38,984
You don't have to be the
man of the house anymore.

1483
01:36:38,985 --> 01:36:40,818
We'll manage just fine.

1484
01:36:40,821 --> 01:36:42,621
I managed without your dad.

1485
01:36:42,622 --> 01:36:44,690
I don't know how I did
that, but I did it.

1486
01:36:44,691 --> 01:36:47,226
We'll manage without
a lot of things.

1487
01:36:47,227 --> 01:36:49,660
Go on, get the hell out of here.

1488
01:36:57,973 --> 01:36:59,273
Mama.

1489
01:37:13,757 --> 01:37:14,823
Mr. Moon!

1490
01:37:14,824 --> 01:37:16,124
Mr. Moon!

1491
01:37:16,293 --> 01:37:18,393
Come on, pull up over here!

1492
01:37:39,769 --> 01:37:41,069
Mrs. Lacey,

1493
01:37:41,638 --> 01:37:43,238
I know you don't take charity.

1494
01:37:43,239 --> 01:37:45,107
You'll be getting a bill.

1495
01:37:45,108 --> 01:37:46,876
Let's go, let's go, everybody!

1496
01:37:46,877 --> 01:37:48,645
Mr. Munimura,
I can't accept this.

1497
01:37:48,646 --> 01:37:50,879
I can't owe people.
I can't.

1498
01:37:51,949 --> 01:37:53,582
We're going to do it

1499
01:37:53,652 --> 01:37:56,152
no matter what you say, Frances.

1500
01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:00,923
It's going to be ok.

1501
01:38:03,128 --> 01:38:04,561
Let's go to work!

1502
01:38:11,755 --> 01:38:13,221
Thank you so much.

1503
01:38:13,222 --> 01:38:14,522
Mama.

1504
01:38:14,724 --> 01:38:16,024
Mama.

1505
01:38:16,793 --> 01:38:18,093
Mama.

1506
01:38:18,962 --> 01:38:20,596
Look at all
the pretty toys you got.

1507
01:38:20,597 --> 01:38:21,897
My goodness.

1508
01:38:38,984 --> 01:38:39,784
I think we're level.

1509
01:38:39,785 --> 01:38:41,085
Come on!

1510
01:38:43,473 --> 01:38:47,240
I don't know. Should it go
over there a little bit?

1511
01:38:51,065 --> 01:38:52,565
Watch the fingers!

1512
01:38:59,274 --> 01:39:00,574
There you go.

1513
01:39:28,957 --> 01:39:31,124
So mama let them build it...

1514
01:39:31,225 --> 01:39:34,227
But just to where it was
before the fire.

1515
01:39:34,228 --> 01:39:37,165
After that, it took us six
months to finish our house...

1516
01:39:37,166 --> 01:39:39,733
And 4 years
to pay everyone back.

1517
01:39:40,202 --> 01:39:43,302
Ok Mr. Moon, come on!
Mom! Get everybody!

1518
01:39:44,239 --> 01:39:46,709
I took a picture
the day we moved back in.

1519
01:39:46,710 --> 01:39:49,010
This camera was borrowed, too.

1520
01:39:54,618 --> 01:39:56,720
Now I'll tell you something
else that's really true,

1521
01:39:56,721 --> 01:39:58,989
but you probably
won't believe it.

1522
01:39:58,990 --> 01:40:01,091
I've never been
back to L.A.,

1523
01:40:01,092 --> 01:40:03,859
and I still live
in Hankston, Idaho.

1524
01:40:04,296 --> 01:40:06,129
Whatever tore us apart,

1525
01:40:06,398 --> 01:40:08,038
building that house
brought us together...

1526
01:40:08,062 --> 01:40:09,166
Forever.

1527
01:40:09,234 --> 01:40:10,534
We...

1528
01:40:10,569 --> 01:40:12,269
Were the Lacey tribe.
