00:03:01,561 --> 00:03:05,122
<i>Everybody wants to get
on the Van Gogh boat.</i>

2
00:03:05,899 --> 00:03:09,596
<i>There's no trip so horrible
that someone won't take it.</i>

3
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:12,069
<i>The idea of the unrecognized genius...</i>

4
00:03:12,138 --> 00:03:16,006
<i>slaving away in a garret
is a deliciously foolish one.</i>

5
00:03:16,076 --> 00:03:18,067
<i>We must credit the life
of Vincent van Gogh...</i>

6
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,442
<i>for really sending
this myth into orbit.</i>

7
00:03:21,414 --> 00:03:24,281
<i>l mean, how many pictures
did he sell? One?</i>

8
00:03:24,351 --> 00:03:26,444
<i>He couldn't give them away.</i>

9
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,089
<i>He has to be the most modern
artist, but everybody hated him.</i>

10
00:03:30,991 --> 00:03:33,516
<i>We're so ashamed of his life
that the rest of art history...</i>

11
00:03:33,593 --> 00:03:36,619
<i>will be retribution
for Van Gogh's neglect.</i>

12
00:03:36,696 --> 00:03:40,689
<i>No one wants to be part of a generation
that ignores another Van Gogh.</i>

13
00:03:41,768 --> 00:03:46,034
<i>ln this town, one is at the mercy
of the recognition factor.</i>

14
00:03:46,106 --> 00:03:49,200
<i>One's public appearance
is absolute.</i>

15
00:03:50,343 --> 00:03:52,971
<i>Part of the artist's job is
to get the work where l will see it.</i>

16
00:03:55,248 --> 00:03:58,183
<i>l consider myself
a metaphor of the public.</i>

17
00:03:58,251 --> 00:04:03,211
<i>l am a public eye,
a witness, a critic.</i>

18
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,623
<i>When you first see
a new picture...</i>

19
00:04:06,693 --> 00:04:08,593
<i>you don't want
to miss the boat.</i>

20
00:04:08,662 --> 00:04:11,222
<i>You have to be very careful.</i>

21
00:04:11,298 --> 00:04:14,563
<i>You might be staring
at Van Gogh's ear.</i>

22
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:45,618
lt's Willie Mays.
What do ya hear? What do ya say?

23
00:05:45,692 --> 00:05:46,989
Nurse!

24
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:50,223
Oysters Rockefeller and
a lovely Pouilly Fuisee, pour plasir.

25
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:52,287
We don't serve that here.

26
00:05:52,365 --> 00:05:55,266
Fine, Gina.
A cheeseburger and a coffee.

That's Rene.
He writes for Art Forum.

28
00:05:58,905 --> 00:06:01,135
He's a fucking rainbow.

29
00:06:05,912 --> 00:06:07,641
You guys know what you want?

30
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:10,581
- Pancakes.
- Pancakes?

31
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,117
You want anything?

l'll have some coffee.

33
00:06:18,858 --> 00:06:21,088
Coffee.
Want some coffee?

34
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:25,390
No? Okay.

35
00:06:25,465 --> 00:06:27,763
You can't have that in here.

36
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:31,600

- You can't have that in here.

37

Who? Her?

38
00:06:33,873 --> 00:06:35,340
Hide it.

39
00:06:36,943 --> 00:06:39,673
Now, that's entertainment.

40
00:06:41,614 --> 00:06:44,105
Pancake table drawing.

41
00:06:44,184 --> 00:06:46,550
You know, l'm a little busy
right now, Benny.

42
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:48,314
Good night.

43
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:55,391

lt's me.

46
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:02,563
All right, making a mess here.
Look at you. Get out!

47
00:07:02,635 --> 00:07:04,660
Okay? Good-bye.

48
00:07:04,738 --> 00:07:06,968
- Where are those pancakes?
- Lech, would you let him order?

49
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,702
Let him order?
You nuts? Out.

50
00:07:11,111 --> 00:07:14,274

Hey, Mom.

56
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,253
You like it here?

57
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,782
lt's okay.

58
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,697
Hey, Gina.

59
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,499
Can l walk you home?

60
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:48,231
Sure.

61
00:08:55,615 --> 00:08:58,379
l'm in a band. We're playing
at the Mudd Club Thursday.

63
00:09:01,054 --> 00:09:03,045

You been camping out?

65
00:09:11,064 --> 00:09:13,828
'Cause you look like
you could use a scrub.

Just come Thursday.

71
00:09:29,582 --> 00:09:32,745
Nah. Too many party girls.

Party girls?

You know that Frankie thing?

79
00:10:31,811 --> 00:10:34,336
We edited it.
Looks pretty good.

80
00:10:34,414 --> 00:10:36,882
Looks really good.
l'm thinking about...

81
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:39,942
putting that
drum mode on it...

82
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:42,647
and making it
into like a nice video.

83
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:45,122
You know,
like a music video.

84
00:10:45,191 --> 00:10:47,716
Press play

85
00:10:49,062 --> 00:10:51,360

What, you don't like it
with the music?

87
00:11:20,493 --> 00:11:22,427
l like it like this.

88
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,690
lt's boring like this.

89
00:11:24,764 --> 00:11:27,733
lt's like looking
at a painting.

90
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,495
You need the music, man.

91
00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:31,662
You need sound.

92

<i>The man just hit me,
and l was on the ground.</i>

<i>Tell me about it.
You're talking to the right guy.</i>

109

00:13:18,711 --> 00:13:22,010
<i>You won't be so arrogant

You don't have any.

140
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:32,360
You got one in your hand.

141
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:38,594
This is a regular screwdriver.
That's a Phillips head, the cross thing.

142
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:41,265
l'll show you later
what all the tools are so you'll know.

143
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,867

But l'm happy

You'll get there.
You'll get there.

151
00:18:05,264 --> 00:18:08,028
lt's good to have
something to fall back on.

152
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,160
That's why
l became an electrician.

153
00:18:11,237 --> 00:18:13,797

You're just like l was.

and you know, man...

159
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,688
l'm glad
l never got any recognition.

160
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:35,784
lt's given me time to develop.

161
00:18:35,861 --> 00:18:39,160
- Can we lose some of this shit?
- No, no. You don't do it.

162
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:42,029
- l can't see this.
- Excuse me, you. What's your name?

163
00:18:42,101 --> 00:18:45,264
Could you come over here
and move some of this stuff, please?

164
00:18:56,148 --> 00:18:58,446
My name's Jean Michel Basquiat.
Have you heard of me?

165
00:18:58,517 --> 00:19:01,953
- No. Should l have?
- l'm a painter too.

166
00:19:02,021 --> 00:19:04,216
Really? Too bad.

167
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,349
No, l'm kidding.

168
00:19:06,425 --> 00:19:10,555
Whoever you are, could you please
move that stuff someplace else?

169
00:19:10,629 --> 00:19:12,688
We can't see the painting.

170
00:19:25,678 --> 00:19:28,306
That told you.

171
00:21:16,288 --> 00:21:18,620
- Come on, man.
- No, man.

172
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:20,852
Put out that cigarette, man.

173
00:21:26,632 --> 00:21:29,760
Benny, man, l didn't think
we were actually gonna do this.

174
00:21:29,835 --> 00:21:32,235
My goodness, you're shattering
all my myths, man.

175
00:21:32,304 --> 00:21:34,238
- About what?
- Play some D.

176
00:21:34,306 --> 00:21:36,706
About you being the first
half-Rican to play for the Knicks.

177
00:21:36,775 --> 00:21:39,608
- Play some D. Open your arms.
- l'm open.

178
00:21:39,678 --> 00:21:41,669
Open them up.
Look down. There you go.

179
00:21:45,117 --> 00:21:48,245
Hey, Benny, man, how long
you think it takes to get famous?

180
00:21:49,321 --> 00:21:52,449
For a musician or a painter?

181
00:21:52,524 --> 00:21:54,082
Whatever. Famous.

182
00:21:55,027 --> 00:21:56,460
Four years.

183
00:21:57,329 --> 00:21:59,263
Six to get rich.

184
00:22:01,133 --> 00:22:03,294
First you're gonna have
to dress right, you know?

185
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:06,099
Then you're gonna have
to hang out with famous people.

186
00:22:06,171 --> 00:22:08,867
You know? Make friends
with the right blond people.

187
00:22:08,941 --> 00:22:12,707
Go to the right parties, yeah.
Socialite.

188
00:22:16,315 --> 00:22:20,012
Then you gotta do your work all the time
when you're not doing that.

189
00:22:20,085 --> 00:22:23,145
But l'm talking about the same
kind of work, the same style...

190
00:22:23,222 --> 00:22:27,591
so people can recognize it and
don't get confused, you know?

191
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:31,187
Then once you're famous--
airborne, you know--

192
00:22:31,263 --> 00:22:34,460
you gotta keep doin' it
in the same way...

193
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,495
even after it's boring--
unless you want people...

194
00:22:37,569 --> 00:22:41,505
to really get mad at you,
which they will anyway.

195
00:22:43,509 --> 00:22:46,603
- Come on, man, let's go.
- Shoot! Come on.

196
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:50,479
l mean, famous people
are usually pretty stupid.

197
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:52,642
You're too smart.

198
00:22:52,718 --> 00:22:55,949
You don't wanna end up like John Henry,
you know, fighting the machine.

199
00:22:56,021 --> 00:22:58,182
- John Henry?
- Absolutely.

200
00:22:58,257 --> 00:23:01,954
John Henry was a steel-driving man
that worked the railroad...

201
00:23:02,861 --> 00:23:05,853
pounding in the spikes
and laying down the track.

202
00:23:05,931 --> 00:23:09,867
Then one day they invented
a machine to do his job, right?

203
00:23:09,935 --> 00:23:12,062
And he says...

204
00:23:12,137 --> 00:23:15,766
''Fuck that.
l'm a man, right?''

205
00:23:15,841 --> 00:23:20,335
So he challenges the machine to a race
to lay down a mile of track, right?

206
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,008
lt takes two days.

207
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,278
They go neck and neck
the whole time--

208
00:23:27,352 --> 00:23:31,345
l mean, right to the end--
and he beats the machine by one spike.

209
00:23:31,423 --> 00:23:35,052
But he dropped dead,
you know, see?

210
00:23:35,127 --> 00:23:37,687
- Boom, but he beat it.
- Boom, but he dropped dead.

211
00:23:37,763 --> 00:23:41,221
- But he beat it.
- You gotta do stuff like you do it.

212
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,497
lt's about integrity, you know.
l mean, your friends like you.

213
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:47,038
What else do you want?

214
00:23:48,741 --> 00:23:51,938
l mean, everyone walks by,
sees your stuff.

215
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,171
- Warhol!
- What?

216
00:23:54,246 --> 00:23:56,237
That's Andy Warhol.

217
00:23:57,282 --> 00:23:59,079
He's a homo.

218
00:23:59,151 --> 00:24:01,142
He's the greatest painter
in the world.

219
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:05,213
No, he paints by numbers.
You don't. What're you doing?

220
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:07,258
l'm giving him one of these, man.
He should have one.

221
00:24:07,326 --> 00:24:09,317
No, don't give him anything, man.
Trade, trade.

222
00:24:09,394 --> 00:24:12,022
Yeah. That's what real artists
do with each other.

223
00:24:12,097 --> 00:24:16,033
Besides, he'll just use you, man.
He's famous for it.

224
00:24:30,749 --> 00:24:33,274
- Can l help you?
- You wanna buy some ignorant art?

225
00:24:33,352 --> 00:24:37,345
- Ten bucks apiece.
- No, l think it's okay.

226
00:24:37,422 --> 00:24:41,153
- Of course, Mr. Bischofberger.
- Gee, ignorant art, Bruno.

227
00:24:42,461 --> 00:24:45,726
Yeah, you know, like stupid,
ridiculous, crummy art.

228
00:24:46,932 --> 00:24:50,800
- That sounds good. That's new.
- Ten bucks.

229
00:24:52,938 --> 00:24:55,031
Gee, you didn't work
very much on these.

230
00:24:55,107 --> 00:24:57,337
l can give you, like, five.

231
00:24:58,243 --> 00:25:02,202
Come on, Bruno, you're rich.
Maybe you should talk to Bruno.

232
00:25:02,281 --> 00:25:03,942
You don't even work
on your stuff.

233
00:25:04,016 --> 00:25:07,918
No, it's not how much you work
on something that matters.

234
00:25:07,986 --> 00:25:10,978
- lt's how much you get for them.
- l can get ten.

235
00:25:12,124 --> 00:25:15,992
These are great, Bruno.
Maybe l'll take two.

236
00:25:16,061 --> 00:25:17,494
l'll take--

237
00:25:18,897 --> 00:25:23,061
Let me see these.
l'll take this one and--

238
00:25:23,135 --> 00:25:24,864
l don't know.

239
00:25:24,937 --> 00:25:27,667
Bruno, can l borrow
some money?

240
00:25:27,739 --> 00:25:29,104
Yeah.

241
00:25:33,478 --> 00:25:35,571
Here. You have change?

242
00:25:35,647 --> 00:25:38,741
You made a good deal.
Here, you can have those too.

243
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:42,919
Let me look at those, Bruno.

244
00:25:42,988 --> 00:25:46,287
Yeah, but they're
mine now, Andy.

245
00:25:46,358 --> 00:25:50,021
Sure, they're yours, Bruno.
Everything good's yours.

246
00:26:20,025 --> 00:26:22,550
Hi. Are those for me?

247
00:26:25,697 --> 00:26:27,358
Bye, Benny.

248
00:26:40,312 --> 00:26:42,837
Which island of Hawaii you
want our house to be on?

249
00:26:42,915 --> 00:26:46,817
Maui? Kauai? Oahu?

250
00:26:48,053 --> 00:26:50,112
l don't know.
l hadn't thought about it.

251
00:26:50,188 --> 00:26:51,587
Maui!

252
00:26:53,592 --> 00:26:56,083
Staten lsland would be fine.

253
00:26:57,696 --> 00:26:59,288
Maybe Oahu.

254
00:27:08,307 --> 00:27:10,298
No, definitely Maui.

255
00:27:15,981 --> 00:27:17,881
Oh, man.

256
00:27:24,089 --> 00:27:25,556
Hey, Gina.

257
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:29,389
Do you wanna marry me?

258
00:28:49,408 --> 00:28:51,399
What did you do to my dress?

259
00:28:51,476 --> 00:28:53,444
Jean, what have you done to my dress?

260
00:28:53,512 --> 00:28:55,810
l painted it for you.
lt's beautiful, baby.

261
00:28:55,881 --> 00:28:58,042
l was wearing this to see
my parents this weekend, Jean!

262
00:28:58,116 --> 00:28:59,879
You can still wear it.

263
00:29:01,486 --> 00:29:04,250
That's great, Jean.
Painting all over my paintings.

264
00:29:04,322 --> 00:29:07,052
l couldn't look at them anymore.
They're kind of impersonal.

265
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:09,320
- Oh, great.
- You're more complex than that.

266
00:29:09,394 --> 00:29:12,557
That's really nice.
How do you like it?

267
00:29:12,631 --> 00:29:14,861
How do you like it if l paint
all over your paintings?

268
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:16,924
- That looks good.
- How do you feel about that?

269
00:29:17,002 --> 00:29:20,062
Do you like me doing that
to your paintings?

270
00:29:20,138 --> 00:29:22,470
Do you?

271
00:29:26,178 --> 00:29:28,738
Get off me!
Get off me!

272
00:29:28,814 --> 00:29:31,647
Come here. Listen.
Do you know what he's saying?

273
00:29:31,716 --> 00:29:35,152
Who? Get off me!

274
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,519
He says l'm jealous of the moon,
because you look at it.

275
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:41,457
He's jealous of the sun,
because it warms you.

276
00:29:41,526 --> 00:29:45,087
He says l feel you,
even when l'm not feeling you.

277
00:29:45,163 --> 00:29:48,360
l talk to you when
l'm not talking to you.

278
00:29:49,267 --> 00:29:52,498
l love you even
when l'm not loving you.

279
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,031
You know l love you, Gina.

280
00:29:58,276 --> 00:30:01,541
Willie Mays! Willie Mays!

281
00:30:11,256 --> 00:30:13,053
Hey, come on up, man.

282
00:30:33,145 --> 00:30:35,579
l heard you
the first seven times.

283
00:30:35,647 --> 00:30:38,115
l'm just saying we got some
rehearsal space tonight.

284
00:30:38,183 --> 00:30:40,174
lt can happen
Friday night, right?

285
00:30:40,252 --> 00:30:42,152
We got some people
coming to see us.

286
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,211
Some people always
come and see us.

287
00:30:46,992 --> 00:30:48,425
Bye.

288
00:30:51,296 --> 00:30:53,287
Hey, Mike.

289
00:30:56,368 --> 00:30:59,303
Benny, man, be more careful!
Damn!

290
00:31:04,976 --> 00:31:06,443
What?

291
00:31:12,217 --> 00:31:14,208
No, come on. Stop it.

292
00:31:14,286 --> 00:31:17,016
Wait, wait, wait. Okay.

293
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:22,920
What would you do
if l kiss you?

294
00:31:23,595 --> 00:31:26,758
You're out of your mind, Benny.
You should take more drugs.

295
00:31:41,246 --> 00:31:43,339
- Hey, Rockets!
- Hey, man.

296
00:31:46,318 --> 00:31:48,752
- Hey, Rockets, can l have this?
- Yeah.

297
00:31:51,022 --> 00:31:53,252
You got the key?
Yeah, l got it.

298
00:31:55,393 --> 00:31:57,190
Hang on a second.

299
00:32:16,248 --> 00:32:17,977
Did you do this, man?

300
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:20,677
Yeah, l gave that to Maripol.
She let me stay here for a while.

301
00:32:20,752 --> 00:32:23,482
You do one for me, and it's free.

302
00:32:47,646 --> 00:32:50,080
Rene, look.
Quick, check him out.

303
00:32:50,148 --> 00:32:52,708
He's right there, look.
He's kind of cute, right?

304
00:32:55,453 --> 00:32:58,217
Those silver things
on his cowboy boots.

305
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:01,088
No, honey, l don't think so.
l gotta take a pee.

306
00:33:07,332 --> 00:33:08,731
Amazing.

307
00:33:12,037 --> 00:33:13,595
Who did this?

308
00:33:13,672 --> 00:33:15,765
How the fuck should l know?

309
00:33:16,675 --> 00:33:20,076
That's Samo, the dude
that was just here. Yo, Benny, where--

310
00:33:26,651 --> 00:33:29,552
Come here, man!
He's right there. Look!

311
00:33:31,022 --> 00:33:33,217
- Here, give me that.
- Right there, right there.

312
00:33:39,331 --> 00:33:42,129
- Keep your eyes on him. Don't lose him!
- Yo, Samo!

313
00:33:57,382 --> 00:33:58,849
Excuse me!

314
00:33:59,884 --> 00:34:01,875
That's your painting up there,
back at that loft?

315
00:34:01,953 --> 00:34:05,150
Oh, at the party at Maripol's.
Yeah. You like it?

316
00:34:06,324 --> 00:34:07,951
You know Albert Milo?

317
00:34:08,026 --> 00:34:09,516
Of course.

318
00:34:09,594 --> 00:34:12,995
l made that nigga.
Rene Ricard.

319
00:34:13,064 --> 00:34:15,862
<i>You didn't read
Not About Albert Milo?</i>

320
00:34:15,934 --> 00:34:18,835
Listen, l know who to hype.

321
00:34:18,903 --> 00:34:21,098
l will make you a star.

322
00:34:21,172 --> 00:34:23,436
You can put me
in the ring with Milo?

323
00:34:23,508 --> 00:34:26,170
l can put you in the ring with him.
l can set the dates.

324
00:34:27,112 --> 00:34:29,171
But the big boys
know how to fight.

325
00:34:29,247 --> 00:34:31,272
Make you look real sissy.

326
00:34:32,484 --> 00:34:35,681
God, l saw that painting.
lt made me ashamed to own anything.

327
00:34:36,755 --> 00:34:39,485
So, Samo.

328
00:34:42,193 --> 00:34:43,854
You got a real name?

329
00:34:44,996 --> 00:34:46,725
Jean Michel Basquiat.

330
00:34:46,798 --> 00:34:49,164
Well, that sounds
famous already.

331
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:54,461
You want some coffee?
Come on.

332
00:34:55,807 --> 00:34:57,775
Come on.

333
00:34:59,644 --> 00:35:02,909
Hey, who are those fools
with the binoculars?

334
00:35:17,695 --> 00:35:20,289
Child, you got
no respect at all.

335
00:35:21,132 --> 00:35:24,363
Nobody taught you
how to mount paintings?

336
00:35:24,436 --> 00:35:27,599
You know me. lt comes
to a mounting, the rougher, the better.

337
00:35:28,773 --> 00:35:31,298
A very important season
in New York, Jean.

338
00:35:31,376 --> 00:35:34,937
One's public appearance
is absolute.

339
00:35:54,499 --> 00:35:57,229
Geez, Louise!
Come here, doll.

340
00:35:58,503 --> 00:36:00,494
This is Jean Michel Basquiat,
Henry.

341
00:36:00,572 --> 00:36:04,372
- Hi. This is my friend Rob.
- Hi, Rob. Jean Michel.

342
00:36:04,442 --> 00:36:09,243
- So, you're Samo.
- ''Say-mo'', darling.

343
00:36:09,314 --> 00:36:12,750
- l really like your graffiti.
- l was a kid then.

344
00:36:12,817 --> 00:36:14,944
How much for that one?

345
00:36:15,019 --> 00:36:17,146
That one?
For you or the museum?

346
00:36:18,223 --> 00:36:19,884
lt's for me.

347
00:36:19,958 --> 00:36:22,324
- Two.
- l'll take it.

348
00:36:22,393 --> 00:36:24,224
Darn right you'll take it.

349
00:36:24,295 --> 00:36:26,320
- Come on, Rob.
- Bye. Nice meeting you.

350
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,230
That's $2,000.

351
00:36:31,302 --> 00:36:33,463
And he's from the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.

352
00:36:33,538 --> 00:36:35,438
So you are ugly star.

353
00:36:37,876 --> 00:36:40,640
Gina, you look beautiful.

354
00:36:40,712 --> 00:36:44,113
Yeah? Really?
lt looks good.

355
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:47,210
Ages! Come here, l want you
to meet somebody.

356
00:36:47,285 --> 00:36:50,277
Jean, this is Annina.
Annina, this is Jean Michel Basquiat.

357
00:36:50,355 --> 00:36:53,347
l am so happy to meet you. Rene refused
to give me your telephone number.

358
00:36:53,424 --> 00:36:55,187
Finders, keepers, doll.

359
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,923
My next show is called ''Public Address'',
but you don't fit.

360
00:36:58,997 --> 00:37:01,227
What do you mean,
l don't fit? l fit.

361
00:37:01,299 --> 00:37:03,790
l can't show you in a gallery
because you don't have any paintings.

362
00:37:03,868 --> 00:37:06,098
Hello! Hello!

363
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,798
Well, give me some money,
l'll make you some.

364
00:37:08,873 --> 00:37:11,865
Would 300 do?

365
00:37:11,943 --> 00:37:15,276
Yeah, sure,
but l don't have a space.

366
00:37:15,346 --> 00:37:17,678
l could find a place
for you to work.

367
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:20,475
Hey, do you want a taste?

368
00:37:20,552 --> 00:37:22,383
No, thanks.

369
00:37:24,289 --> 00:37:27,190
You're doing very well.
Very well.

370
00:37:30,461 --> 00:37:32,122
Who is that?

371
00:37:34,198 --> 00:37:36,393
Okay. You are
so full of crap, you.

372
00:37:36,467 --> 00:37:38,458
How do you know
Bruno Bischofberger?

373
00:37:39,737 --> 00:37:42,968
- l had lunch with him once.
- Oh, did we?

374
00:37:51,883 --> 00:37:56,013
Kind of a family portrait.
lt looks done.

375
00:37:57,855 --> 00:37:59,914
You think so?

376
00:37:59,991 --> 00:38:02,118
l think it could use
some babies.

377
00:38:05,263 --> 00:38:07,128
Babies with you?

378
00:38:08,499 --> 00:38:10,558
What's wrong with me?

379
00:38:11,869 --> 00:38:13,860
You're your own baby.

380
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:20,442
- Who is it?
- Annina Nosei.

381
00:38:21,779 --> 00:38:23,770
- Who?
- Annina.

382
00:38:25,016 --> 00:38:28,076
- Hello? Oh, it's you.
- ls Jean Michel here?

383
00:38:28,152 --> 00:38:31,713
- No.
- l'm here to see some work.

384
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:35,786
There's some right there.

385
00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:45,894
- These are great.
- Aren't they?

386
00:38:46,571 --> 00:38:49,540
l like these.
l'll take these.

387
00:38:49,607 --> 00:38:52,132
l think you should probably
talk to him about that.

388
00:38:52,777 --> 00:38:55,803
Do Rene and Jean
have a contract together?

389
00:38:59,117 --> 00:39:02,553
- l don't know.
- l think he's ready for a show.

390
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,555
- Really? When?
- Next month.

391
00:39:06,758 --> 00:39:09,818
You know, l think you should probably
talk to him about all this.

392
00:39:14,065 --> 00:39:15,930
When?

393
00:39:17,168 --> 00:39:18,931
How about right now?

394
00:39:19,003 --> 00:39:23,463
Well, l'll go get ready.
l'll be ready in one minute.

395
00:39:39,457 --> 00:39:41,152
This is it.

396
00:40:17,161 --> 00:40:20,062
<i>United States Savings Bonds
and the Mutual Network present:</i>

397
00:40:20,131 --> 00:40:21,792
<i>''Bands For Bonds''.</i>

398
00:40:25,369 --> 00:40:27,894
<i>ln the background we have the choicest
collection of modern musicians...</i>

399
00:40:27,972 --> 00:40:30,805
<i>gathered together by Barry Udinov,
editor of Metronome magazine.</i>

400
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:33,173
<i>Dizzy Gillespie, trumpet.</i>

401
00:40:33,244 --> 00:40:35,508

00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:57,892
<i>Lenny Tristano, piano.</i>

406
00:40:57,969 --> 00:41:00,096
<i>That was Max Roach
as the drums.</i>

407
00:41:01,672 --> 00:41:04,072
<i>And Ray Brown on the bass.</i>

408
00:41:42,213 --> 00:41:44,010
These are beautiful.

409
00:41:46,017 --> 00:41:47,814
l really love this.

410
00:41:52,056 --> 00:41:56,152
Never tell a painter you like anything.
They'll invariably change it.

411
00:42:01,399 --> 00:42:02,764
Hello?

412
00:42:03,835 --> 00:42:06,463
He's not here right now.
Hang on a second.

413
00:42:07,138 --> 00:42:09,606
lt's Benny. He wants to know
why you're not at band practice.

414
00:42:09,674 --> 00:42:12,199
Fuck!
l forgot about that.

415
00:42:12,276 --> 00:42:14,176
Are you Tony Bennett?

416
00:42:14,245 --> 00:42:17,339
Are you Tony Bennett? You sing on stage?
You paint in your spare time?

417
00:42:17,415 --> 00:42:19,815
- l didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
- That's my point exactly.

418
00:42:19,884 --> 00:42:22,352
Hello. Hello?

419
00:42:24,689 --> 00:42:28,250
Rene, if you're so smart, what are you
doing down in this basement with me?

420
00:42:28,326 --> 00:42:31,454
You are the news,
and l want the scoop.

421
00:42:32,797 --> 00:42:34,697
Look...

422
00:42:34,765 --> 00:42:37,928
when l speak,
no one believes me.

423
00:42:38,002 --> 00:42:41,335
When l write it down,
people know it's true.

424
00:42:42,673 --> 00:42:44,732
There's never been
a black painter in art history...

425
00:42:44,809 --> 00:42:48,040
who's been considered
really important, you know that?

426
00:42:48,112 --> 00:42:50,603
Are you a writer
or a white writer?

427
00:42:50,681 --> 00:42:52,672
l may be white,
but l'm a nigga.

428
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,411
You ask anybody.

429
00:42:59,891 --> 00:43:03,349
- What time is it?
- lt's 5:11.

430
00:43:27,451 --> 00:43:29,316
That one's for you.

431
00:43:40,998 --> 00:43:42,829
Hey, it's the big a.m.

432
00:43:45,303 --> 00:43:47,430
Rene's been telling me
about your work.

433
00:43:50,241 --> 00:43:52,004
ls that finished yet?

434
00:43:53,144 --> 00:43:54,805
l don't know.

435
00:43:59,417 --> 00:44:01,078
When's your show?

436
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,878
Two weeks.

437
00:44:03,955 --> 00:44:07,482
- How was yours?
- l haven't decided yet.

438
00:44:09,493 --> 00:44:11,484
This is nice. l like that.

439
00:44:12,563 --> 00:44:15,088
Hey, baby. Come on over.

440
00:44:15,166 --> 00:44:16,929
l wanna make a painting of you.

441
00:44:17,001 --> 00:44:19,196
- You got any coffee?
- Yeah, l've got...

442
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:21,329
coffee, cream cheese, bagels.

443
00:44:21,405 --> 00:44:23,396
Thanks for lettin' me stop by.

444
00:44:24,875 --> 00:44:26,740
That could use
a little bit more pink.

445
00:44:26,811 --> 00:44:28,972
lt doesn't need the pink.
See ya.

446
00:44:36,954 --> 00:44:39,479
Albert Milo, what a pleasure
it is to meet you.

447
00:44:39,557 --> 00:44:41,718
This is my friend,
Rene Ricard.

448
00:44:41,792 --> 00:44:44,852
- We're Tom and Cynthia Kruger.
- lt's a pleasure.

449
00:44:44,929 --> 00:44:46,794
lt's very nice to have met you.

450
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,291
This is Tom and Cynthia Kruger.

451
00:44:51,369 --> 00:44:52,802
l heard.

452
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:55,737
- This is Jean Michel Basquiat.
- Hi.

453
00:44:55,806 --> 00:44:58,604
You've seen the Samo graffiti
everywhere. That's his.

454
00:44:58,676 --> 00:45:01,236
This is the true
voice of the gutter.

455
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:06,414
l've seen the graffiti, and l've heard
wonderful things about your paintings.

456
00:45:06,484 --> 00:45:09,419
Everybody's talking about you.
Your ears must be burning.

457
00:45:09,487 --> 00:45:11,853
Most of these
are reserved already.

458
00:45:11,922 --> 00:45:14,584
After Thursday, this work
will not be available.

459
00:45:14,658 --> 00:45:17,320
lt's a beautiful painting,
and it's still free.

460
00:45:17,395 --> 00:45:20,796
l don't know. l don't know if l could
live with this one. lt's--

461
00:45:20,865 --> 00:45:24,858
l like it, but the green
is sort of institutional.

462
00:45:24,935 --> 00:45:28,928
Sweetheart, have you been
in an institution lately?

463
00:45:30,274 --> 00:45:31,969
Boom! Jean-Claude Killy!

464
00:45:32,043 --> 00:45:35,012
What's up, man?

465
00:45:36,781 --> 00:45:40,808
You's a nigga to be gettin' paid for this.

466
00:45:40,885 --> 00:45:42,682
- You like it, man?
- Not bad.

467
00:45:43,354 --> 00:45:45,015
Yeah, l do.

468
00:45:45,089 --> 00:45:48,820
lt's fascinating, his choice
of crossing out words that way.

469
00:45:48,893 --> 00:45:52,351
Yes, well, they are more meaningful
in their absence, no?

470
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:55,058
Yeah, J M,
what does it mean?

471
00:45:55,132 --> 00:45:58,329
l don't know. l just don't know
if l can live with the green.

472
00:45:58,402 --> 00:46:00,927
You want me to make it
a nice brown?

473
00:46:01,005 --> 00:46:04,497
l beg your pardon?
Nobody makes fun of my wife but me.

474
00:46:04,575 --> 00:46:06,736
l don't know.
l just can't make up my mind.

475
00:46:06,811 --> 00:46:10,144
l really like this one,
but it's just--

476
00:46:10,214 --> 00:46:12,045
lt's the green.

477
00:46:12,116 --> 00:46:14,380
Get a decorator.

478
00:46:14,452 --> 00:46:16,943
These paintings
aren't even done yet.

479
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:21,754
We'll take the green one.

480
00:46:41,378 --> 00:46:44,347
- How can l thank you?
- Maybe l can squeeze your titties?

481
00:46:45,716 --> 00:46:48,913
- Want a Mac? Have a Mac.
- No. l want my scarf.

482
00:46:48,986 --> 00:46:50,977
No, l don't want a Mac.
Give me my scarf.

483
00:46:51,055 --> 00:46:53,922
Sweetheart, l dare you
to break my heart.

484
00:46:53,991 --> 00:46:57,222
- Oh, man!
- l dare you to break my heart.

485
00:46:57,294 --> 00:46:59,285
Have a Mac.
No. l don't eat junk food.

486
00:46:59,363 --> 00:47:01,524
- Let's go to Lutece.
- What, you're paying?

487
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,965
- You coming?
- No.

488
00:47:04,034 --> 00:47:06,502
- l'm gonna keep the scarf anyway.
- No, you're not. lt's mine.

489
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:09,801
- What's your name?
- l ain't tellin' you. Too fast.

490
00:47:09,874 --> 00:47:11,535
- No name?
- No.

491
00:47:11,609 --> 00:47:14,635
How about if l call you Big Pink?

492
00:47:17,515 --> 00:47:19,210
Come on!

493
00:47:20,918 --> 00:47:22,408
Hurry up!

494
00:47:22,486 --> 00:47:24,113
Baby, l'm coming.

495
00:47:27,591 --> 00:47:29,252
What are you doing?

496
00:47:30,394 --> 00:47:33,693
You're so loaded!
What'd you do, rob a bank?

497
00:47:33,764 --> 00:47:36,995
- Where are you taking me?
- We're going, like l said.

498
00:47:37,067 --> 00:47:39,467
Yeah, right.
ls that real money?

499
00:47:50,114 --> 00:47:52,605
You want a tuna fish sandwich?

500
00:47:52,683 --> 00:47:54,082
Yeah.

501
00:48:01,192 --> 00:48:04,355
- Where'd you get the scarf?

502
00:48:05,829 --> 00:48:08,263
Oh, it's a present
l picked up for you.

503
00:48:18,809 --> 00:48:20,504
Let me see.

504
00:48:25,849 --> 00:48:27,714
You look like an angel.

505
00:51:02,806 --> 00:51:04,330
Wake up.

506
00:51:22,126 --> 00:51:23,787
Jean, wake up.

507
00:52:21,685 --> 00:52:23,312
Honk the horn again, please.

508
00:52:26,757 --> 00:52:28,315
Look at him.

509
00:52:30,461 --> 00:52:31,894
What?

510
00:52:37,901 --> 00:52:39,892
There are sick people
living in this building.

511
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:41,870
What time is it, Benny, man?

512
00:52:41,939 --> 00:52:44,066
Thompson and Spring, please.

513
00:52:44,141 --> 00:52:46,200
What time is it, man?

514
00:52:46,276 --> 00:52:48,267
You're late!
That's what time it is!

515
00:52:49,513 --> 00:52:51,538
What's the rush, John Henry?

516
00:52:51,615 --> 00:52:53,515
lt's Jean Michel.

517
00:52:53,584 --> 00:52:54,983
Toke?

518
00:52:59,456 --> 00:53:01,686
What is your problem, man?

519
00:53:03,894 --> 00:53:05,987
l don't have any problems.

520
00:53:06,063 --> 00:53:08,725
Then what do you have?
Give me my joint, man!

521
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:10,994
Check you out!

522
00:53:11,068 --> 00:53:15,027
You get a little attention, you start
acting all uppity and shit with me.

523
00:53:17,274 --> 00:53:18,935
What's that about?

524
00:53:19,009 --> 00:53:21,671
- About what?
- What's that about?

525
00:53:21,745 --> 00:53:23,736
- What?
- What just--

526
00:53:23,814 --> 00:53:25,577
You mean like uppity nigga?

527
00:53:26,917 --> 00:53:29,613
What gives you the audacity...

528
00:53:29,686 --> 00:53:31,881
to even think that, man?

529
00:53:32,856 --> 00:53:36,952
Hey, for all you know, you might
just be a flash in the pan, man.

530
00:53:37,027 --> 00:53:39,188
And let me tell you,
you can never tell.

531
00:53:39,263 --> 00:53:41,424
You're just jealous 'cause
it ain't happening to you.

532
00:53:41,498 --> 00:53:44,296
Think what you want, man.

533
00:53:45,602 --> 00:53:48,765
Fuck you.
Making me feel bad, man.

534
00:53:48,839 --> 00:53:52,536
Yo, pull over. Pull over.

535
00:54:42,859 --> 00:54:44,884
- Yo, Andy, man.
- Jean.

536
00:54:44,962 --> 00:54:47,487
Boom, that jacket.
Can l paint that?

537
00:54:47,564 --> 00:54:50,499
Wow, you look great.
Your show looks great.

538
00:54:52,769 --> 00:54:55,567
l can't believe you did
all these in your basement.

539
00:54:55,639 --> 00:54:57,732
You kids can do anything.

540
00:54:57,808 --> 00:55:00,936
Oh, Mary, this is Jean.
Jean, this is Mary Boone.

541
00:55:01,011 --> 00:55:02,945
She's showing
all the great new painters.

542
00:55:03,013 --> 00:55:05,504
- Yeah, l met her already.
- You should be very pleased.

543
00:55:05,582 --> 00:55:08,278
- lt's a very handsome show.
- Yeah.

544
00:55:08,352 --> 00:55:10,081
lt's just in the wrong gallery.

545
00:55:10,153 --> 00:55:13,020
Yeah. l'll see you later
at dinner, though.

546
00:55:14,091 --> 00:55:15,615
Are you coming?

547
00:55:15,692 --> 00:55:17,421
Jean, your parents are here.

548
00:55:19,029 --> 00:55:20,758
Those aren't my parents.

549
00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:24,190
Those are not his parents?

550
00:55:25,268 --> 00:55:28,567
- Well, one of them is.
- Which one?

551
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:30,869
- Hey, Dad.
- You must be very proud.

552
00:55:30,941 --> 00:55:34,240
Very proud.
Quite a production.

553
00:55:34,311 --> 00:55:37,439
So tell me, how does it feel
to have a genius in the family?

554
00:55:37,514 --> 00:55:38,606
Good.

555
00:55:38,682 --> 00:55:40,877
Lucky for you.
l only have convicts in my family.

556
00:55:54,665 --> 00:55:57,293
- Jean, great show, man.
- Yeah, yeah.

557
00:55:57,367 --> 00:56:00,131
- Hey, step into the office.
- That's mine.

558
00:56:00,203 --> 00:56:02,433
- l can't.
- Hey, it's a gift, man!

559
00:56:02,506 --> 00:56:04,030
lt's a gift!

560
00:56:09,146 --> 00:56:11,478
Jean, come on.
This guy wants to take a picture.

561
00:56:13,817 --> 00:56:16,786
Come on, come on.
He won't bite.

562
00:56:19,022 --> 00:56:20,683
Oh, wow.

563
00:56:20,757 --> 00:56:22,884
Twisted his arm, but here he is.

564
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,825
Gentlemen, a little tighter.

565
00:56:25,896 --> 00:56:29,297
- Hey, Albert, get in the picture, man.
- Come on, beautiful.

566
00:56:29,366 --> 00:56:32,665
- Still a great suit.
- Of the painters, please.

567
00:56:32,736 --> 00:56:34,931
- The painters.
- Yeah, no, that's better. Go on.

568
00:56:35,005 --> 00:56:36,870
Mr. Bischofberger, please.

569
00:56:38,308 --> 00:56:40,708
- Thank you.
- Hey, Mom, Dad.

570
00:56:40,777 --> 00:56:42,938
Jackie. Andy.
You know Andy.

571
00:56:43,013 --> 00:56:45,675
- How are you?
- Hi. Yeah. Great color.

572
00:56:45,749 --> 00:56:47,740
This is Jean Michel.
This is my wife.

573
00:56:47,818 --> 00:56:49,809
This is Jack. That's Esther.
My mom and dad.

574
00:56:49,886 --> 00:56:51,717
Are your folks here?

575
00:56:52,355 --> 00:56:56,257
My dad's here with his wife,
but my mom couldn't make it.

576
00:56:56,326 --> 00:56:59,659
On such a special occasion?
Why?

577
00:57:01,631 --> 00:57:04,862
- She's sick.
- l'm sorry.

578
00:57:04,935 --> 00:57:07,802
- l don't indulge. Thank you.
- That's cool.

579
00:57:07,871 --> 00:57:10,772
Jean Michel, may l
talk to you, please?

580
00:57:12,342 --> 00:57:14,572
Andy, you want
to take my picture?

581
00:57:15,712 --> 00:57:16,906
Yeah.

582
00:57:18,281 --> 00:57:21,512
l hear you're leaving Annina.

583
00:57:23,453 --> 00:57:26,684
Now, you know
l love your painting.

584
00:57:27,824 --> 00:57:30,691
l would like
to represent you worldwide.

585
00:57:31,762 --> 00:57:34,094
We start with a show
in Zurich.

586
00:57:34,164 --> 00:57:35,654
And later...

587
00:57:37,067 --> 00:57:40,161
l get us a partner in New York.

588
00:57:40,237 --> 00:57:42,034
Maybe Mary Boone, huh?

589
00:57:45,642 --> 00:57:48,941
Now, l especially
like this painting.

590
00:57:49,012 --> 00:57:52,846
l would like to have that
for my own private collection.

591
00:57:52,916 --> 00:57:55,214
No, l wasn't
gonna sell that one.

592
00:57:55,285 --> 00:57:59,016
No? Well,
you shouldn't have shown it.

593
00:57:59,089 --> 00:58:03,082
l mean, this is the one.
l absolutely have to have this one.

594
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:07,187
l mean, this is super-fantastic.
Oh, Jean Michel, l must have it.

595
00:58:07,264 --> 00:58:10,461
Hey, l absolutely
must have this painting.

596
00:58:12,469 --> 00:58:13,800
Okay, sure.

597
00:58:14,971 --> 00:58:16,529
Thank you.

598
00:58:19,976 --> 00:58:23,002
Can l borrow your limousine?
l'll bring it back to you in an hour.

599
00:58:23,079 --> 00:58:24,478
lt's okay.

600
00:58:24,548 --> 00:58:26,539
Just have them
drop you at Mr. Chow's.

601
00:58:26,616 --> 00:58:28,481
- We'll all be there.
- Cool, cool.

602
00:58:28,552 --> 00:58:30,213
lt's a great show.

603
00:58:39,563 --> 00:58:42,031
You sold my painting?

604
00:58:42,098 --> 00:58:44,862
- l can make you another one.
- You sold my painting?

605
00:58:44,935 --> 00:58:48,302
Let me tell you something.
When climbing that ladder of success...

606
00:58:48,371 --> 00:58:51,272
you do not kick out the fucking rungs,
and you believe that shit!

607
00:58:53,343 --> 00:58:55,573
- Rene!

608
00:58:57,514 --> 00:59:01,780
<i>What is it about art anyway that
we give it so much importance?</i>

609
00:59:01,852 --> 00:59:04,218
<i>Art is so respected by the poor
because what they do...</i>

610
00:59:04,287 --> 00:59:06,278
<i>is an honest way
to get out of the slum...</i>

611
00:59:06,356 --> 00:59:09,291
<i>using one's sheer self
as the medium.</i>

612
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:11,793
<i>The money earned,
proof, pure and simple...</i>

613
00:59:11,862 --> 00:59:14,922
<i>of the value of that
individual, the artist.</i>

614
00:59:15,699 --> 00:59:18,600
<i>The picture a mother's son does
in jail hangs on her wall...</i>

615
00:59:18,668 --> 00:59:22,001
<i>as proof that beauty is possible
even in the most wretched.</i>

616
00:59:22,072 --> 00:59:24,063
<i>And this is
a much different idea...</i>

617
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:27,598
<i>than the fancier notion that art
is a scam and a rip-off.</i>

618
00:59:28,378 --> 00:59:32,314
<i>But you could never explain to someone
who uses God's gift to enslave...</i>

619
00:59:32,382 --> 00:59:35,647
<i>that you have used
God's gift to be free.</i>

620
00:59:38,521 --> 00:59:40,421
Hey, man, turn that up.

621
00:59:42,025 --> 00:59:43,754
''Bird'', man.

622
00:59:46,329 --> 00:59:48,889
l really, really...

623
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,332
really admire you, man.

624
00:59:52,402 --> 00:59:53,994
Me? Why?

625
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:57,164
l mean, you did it.
l mean, you made it.

626
01:00:01,311 --> 01:00:02,369
You know...

627
01:00:03,446 --> 01:00:05,471
l'm a painter too.

628
01:00:07,083 --> 01:00:08,414
Oh, yeah?

629
01:00:12,022 --> 01:00:15,185
Come check out my studio
sometime?

630
01:00:16,426 --> 01:00:17,893
Sure.

631
01:00:17,961 --> 01:00:20,486
l love it, man.

632
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:26,563
''Plush, safe he think''.

633
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,367
What's your name, man?

634
01:00:32,442 --> 01:00:35,639
They call me Steve, man,
but l prefer Shenge.

635
01:00:35,712 --> 01:00:36,770
Shenge.

636
01:00:38,548 --> 01:00:40,209
You want a job?

637
01:00:45,436 --> 01:00:48,928
Good evening.
Annina's waiting for you.

638
01:00:58,216 --> 01:01:00,684
Mr. Chow, a chair, please.

639
01:01:02,754 --> 01:01:04,449
To a great show, Jean.

640
01:01:04,522 --> 01:01:06,683
- Cheers.
- Here's to you.

641
01:01:07,892 --> 01:01:09,484
You finish it.

642
01:01:11,763 --> 01:01:16,496
He used to. Nixon used to have
a place at the Waldorf-Astoria.

643
01:01:16,567 --> 01:01:19,365
But then he moved
to Saddle River, New Jersey.

644
01:01:19,437 --> 01:01:21,302
Saddle River, New York.

645
01:01:21,372 --> 01:01:25,331
- Saddle River's in New Jersey.
- Saddle River's in New York.

646
01:01:25,409 --> 01:01:27,343
- lt's in New Jersey.
- lt's in New York!

647
01:01:27,411 --> 01:01:30,972
- Saddle River's in New Jersey.
- New York!

648
01:01:31,048 --> 01:01:33,073
l hear your show
already sold out.

649
01:01:34,318 --> 01:01:38,220
There is a very important collector
interested in buying some of your work.

650
01:01:38,289 --> 01:01:40,223
- lt's in New Jersey.
- New York!

651
01:01:40,291 --> 01:01:42,555
Bring him by the studio sometime.
l have some other stuff to show him.

652
01:01:42,627 --> 01:01:44,094
Saddle River's in New York!

653
01:01:46,097 --> 01:01:48,031
l didn't know that,
did you, Henry?

654
01:01:53,938 --> 01:01:56,133
A bottle of your
best champagne, darling.

655
01:01:56,207 --> 01:01:57,765
Hi, Michael. Hello.

656
01:01:57,842 --> 01:02:00,743
Hi, darling.

657
01:02:00,812 --> 01:02:03,474
Well, you cannot buy
advertising like this.

658
01:02:03,548 --> 01:02:07,245
This will be the most glamorous party
you'll have here all fall, guaranteed.

659
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:11,948
Oh, my. Could l get some
of that imitation crab?

660
01:02:12,023 --> 01:02:15,720
l am just famished.
And a chair, please! Dominic, chair.

661
01:02:15,793 --> 01:02:17,852
Well, that was a lovely show.

662
01:02:17,929 --> 01:02:21,592
Absolutely lovely, but hey,
we're no longer collecting art...

663
01:02:21,666 --> 01:02:23,566
we're buying people, aren't we?

664
01:02:23,634 --> 01:02:25,124
Shut up, Rene.

665
01:02:25,203 --> 01:02:28,866
Oh, Andy, please. Everything's
over your head, we all know that.

666
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:31,807
Even Mr. Chow's menu's
over your head.

667
01:02:31,876 --> 01:02:33,867
God, that's beautiful.

668
01:02:37,048 --> 01:02:38,913
Look at that.

669
01:02:38,983 --> 01:02:42,919
Gorgeous. Gorgeous.
Look at that, is he not great?

670
01:02:42,987 --> 01:02:47,287
That is an absolutely
stupendous piece of work.

671
01:02:47,358 --> 01:02:49,292
Thank you. He owes me one.

672
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:51,760
- Doesn't he, Bruno?
- You're too much, Rene.

673
01:02:51,829 --> 01:02:55,230
- Get this guy out of here.
- Oh, come-- Please!

674
01:02:55,299 --> 01:02:58,359
Relax.
Can l have my chair, please?

675
01:02:58,436 --> 01:03:00,370
<i>- You'll never miss me
- Oh, come on!</i>

676
01:03:00,438 --> 01:03:03,896
l haven't eaten a thing.
l am starved to death, darling.

677
01:03:03,975 --> 01:03:07,843
Please, get your hands off me.
lt's okay, we're friends.

678
01:03:07,912 --> 01:03:10,278
We're friends--
please go away.

679
01:03:10,348 --> 01:03:14,045
Get your hands off me! 
l want a chair!

680
01:03:14,118 --> 01:03:17,519
<i>- Why must we say adieu
- l want a chair! All right, l'm going.</i>

681
01:03:17,588 --> 01:03:21,718
Get your hands off me!

682
01:03:21,792 --> 01:03:24,659
We're friends!

683
01:03:24,729 --> 01:03:27,789
Fuck off. Get your hands off!

684
01:03:27,865 --> 01:03:30,493
Okay, l'm going!

685
01:03:30,568 --> 01:03:32,832
l've left Diana Vreeland
waiting long enough.

686
01:03:34,739 --> 01:03:38,698
lt was such a good drawing, Jean Michel.
You should do another one for Michael.

687
01:03:38,776 --> 01:03:41,142
Perhaps some other time, Andy.

688
01:03:41,212 --> 01:03:45,376
<i>...there and un petit Manet there.</i>

689
01:03:45,449 --> 01:03:48,646
<i>- l lost my station
- lt's great that people are interested.</i>

690
01:03:48,719 --> 01:03:51,950
But if anyone's going to buy anything,
l'll handle it for you.

691
01:03:52,023 --> 01:03:55,823
Everything goes through the gallery,
even if they come to your studio.

692
01:03:55,893 --> 01:03:58,487
<i>- Oh, Paris, please
- Sure, sure.</i>

693
01:04:00,698 --> 01:04:05,067
<i>Stay the same.</i>

694
01:04:07,705 --> 01:04:10,196
<i>You've had 23 one-man shows.</i>

695
01:04:10,274 --> 01:04:14,472
<i>You've been in 43 group shows
from Zurich to Tokyo.</i>

696
01:04:14,545 --> 01:04:16,911
You've had over 50 articles
written about you.

697
01:04:16,981 --> 01:04:20,747
You've switched galleries
how many times?

698
01:04:20,818 --> 01:04:22,809
You've deejayed
in the hottest clubs.

699
01:04:26,657 --> 01:04:29,524
One of the youngest artists
ever to be included...

700
01:04:29,593 --> 01:04:31,527
in the Whitney biennial.

701
01:04:31,595 --> 01:04:33,722
Produced a rap record.

702
01:04:33,798 --> 01:04:35,823
lt's said you're quite
the ladies' man.

703
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:41,731
You dated Madonna...

704
01:04:41,806 --> 01:04:44,468
a couple of months, right?

705
01:04:44,542 --> 01:04:48,137
All this at the
ripe old age of 24.

706
01:04:48,212 --> 01:04:50,840
One might ask,
is there anything left...

707
01:04:50,915 --> 01:04:54,112
for Jean Michel Basquiat to do?

708
01:04:54,185 --> 01:04:56,346
Bottom line:

709
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:58,354
What is it...

710
01:04:58,422 --> 01:05:00,356
gets you out of bed
in the morning?

711
01:05:02,927 --> 01:05:04,690
l hate this, man.
Turn that off.

712
01:05:05,763 --> 01:05:07,958
Oh, come on.
No, it's all right.

713
01:05:08,032 --> 01:05:10,364
Look, come back.
l can do better.

714
01:05:10,434 --> 01:05:12,368
Please, please.

715
01:05:14,071 --> 01:05:15,971
Thank you.

716
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,905
Okay. Ready?

717
01:05:20,511 --> 01:05:23,275
You ready?

718
01:05:23,347 --> 01:05:25,815
Can you decipher this for us?

719
01:05:28,252 --> 01:05:31,983
Decipher?
Just words.

720
01:05:32,056 --> 01:05:34,752
Yeah, l understand,
but whose words are these?

721
01:05:34,825 --> 01:05:36,759
l mean, where do you
take them from?

722
01:05:38,529 --> 01:05:41,930
l don't know. Would you ask a musician--
would you ask Miles...

723
01:05:41,999 --> 01:05:43,864
where'd you get that note from?

724
01:05:44,935 --> 01:05:48,336
l mean--
Where do you take your words from?

725
01:05:48,406 --> 01:05:50,840
- You know?
- Right.

726
01:05:50,908 --> 01:05:53,399
Everywhere.

727
01:05:53,477 --> 01:05:57,277
What's that?
The three circles.

728
01:05:57,348 --> 01:05:58,838
- Here?
- Yeah.

729
01:05:58,916 --> 01:06:01,510
- lt's a flea.
- Looks like a chicken.

730
01:06:02,753 --> 01:06:04,311
Trust me, it's a flea.

731
01:06:04,388 --> 01:06:08,256
And that, in the black box?

732
01:06:08,325 --> 01:06:10,520
Those are parasites.

733
01:06:10,594 --> 01:06:13,358
Flea, parasite, and 46 and 47?

734
01:06:13,431 --> 01:06:15,365
lt says leeches.

735
01:06:15,433 --> 01:06:18,493
lt's number 46 and 47
in a list of thousands...

736
01:06:18,569 --> 01:06:21,834
of leeches on this planet.

737
01:06:21,906 --> 01:06:24,340
What's the difference between--

738
01:06:24,408 --> 01:06:26,433
Between a flea, parasite and a leech?

739
01:06:26,510 --> 01:06:29,479
- Hardly any.
- Why are people...

740
01:06:29,547 --> 01:06:32,983
so crudely drawn?

741
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:36,952
Well, most people tend to be pretty--
generally pretty crude.

742
01:06:37,021 --> 01:06:39,182
l really don't know
that many refined people.

743
01:06:45,196 --> 01:06:47,994
Yeah, that looks good like that, man.

744
01:06:48,065 --> 01:06:52,331
- What's that?
- Oh, it's...

745
01:06:52,403 --> 01:06:54,871
a pile of tires l painted.

746
01:06:54,939 --> 01:06:56,839
l knew that.

747
01:07:00,277 --> 01:07:03,212
Do you consider yourself
some kind of primal expressionist?

748
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:06,977
You mean a primate?
Like an ape?

749
01:07:07,051 --> 01:07:09,645
Do you consider yourself a painter,
or a black painter?

750
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:12,712
l use a lot of colors,
not just black.

751
01:07:18,696 --> 01:07:21,256
lt's more a creole, you know?

752
01:07:22,533 --> 01:07:24,694
And what l mean by creole
is that...

753
01:07:24,768 --> 01:07:27,931
it's a mix of Africa and Europe...

754
01:07:28,005 --> 01:07:31,805
in much the same way that an African
in Haiti speaks French.

755
01:07:31,876 --> 01:07:33,901
Your father's from Haiti.

756
01:07:35,579 --> 01:07:38,446
How do you respond
to being called...

757
01:07:38,516 --> 01:07:41,246
''The pickaninny of the art world''?

758
01:07:45,189 --> 01:07:48,022
<i>- Who said that?
- That's from Time magazine.</i>

759
01:07:48,092 --> 01:07:50,754
No, they said l was the Eddie Murphy
of the art world.

760
01:07:53,063 --> 01:07:54,496
My mistake.

761
01:07:58,135 --> 01:08:00,467
Let me just
open something up here.

762
01:08:00,538 --> 01:08:04,770
You come from a middle class home.

763
01:08:04,842 --> 01:08:06,776
Your father's an accountant.

764
01:08:08,579 --> 01:08:12,606
Why did you live in a cardboard box
in Tompkins Square?

765
01:08:15,986 --> 01:08:20,548
Do you feel that you're
being exploited or...

766
01:08:22,126 --> 01:08:25,289
are you yourself exploiting...

767
01:08:25,362 --> 01:08:30,390
the white image of the black artist
from the ghetto?

768
01:08:30,467 --> 01:08:32,435
Ghetto?

769
01:08:32,503 --> 01:08:35,233
l don't exploit it, no.

770
01:08:40,010 --> 01:08:42,069
Other people--

771
01:08:44,748 --> 01:08:47,239
See, you make me
put my foot in my mouth.

772
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:53,757
Other people, it's possible, other
people might exploit it, it's possible.

773
01:08:54,658 --> 01:08:56,990
ls it true?

774
01:09:01,098 --> 01:09:05,034
Your mother resides in
a mental institution? ls that right?

775
01:09:12,243 --> 01:09:14,040
You angry?

776
01:09:23,487 --> 01:09:25,114
Now, right now?

777
01:09:25,189 --> 01:09:29,455
No, as an artist.
ln general.

778
01:09:37,268 --> 01:09:41,671
Okay.
Good, that's good.

779
01:09:43,207 --> 01:09:45,141
Thank you.

780
01:11:06,857 --> 01:11:09,587
- l'm home.
- Hi, Jean.

781
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:14,256
That's great, Frank.
Can you, l don't know, whiz over here?

782
01:11:16,333 --> 01:11:18,267
More that way.

783
01:11:18,335 --> 01:11:20,303
What's with the wigs?

784
01:11:20,371 --> 01:11:22,771
l'm gonna give 'em
to people for Christmas.

785
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:26,241
You think that's a good present?
Who wants an old wig?

786
01:11:26,310 --> 01:11:28,278
Yeah, sure.

787
01:11:29,046 --> 01:11:30,980
Oh, bad painting.

788
01:11:31,048 --> 01:11:33,608
Not bad painting, Jean.
Oxidation art.

789
01:11:33,684 --> 01:11:36,414
Yeah, l hate
cleaning brushes too.

790
01:11:36,487 --> 01:11:40,583
l'm going to do some more of these.
Frank's been drinking this beer...

791
01:11:40,657 --> 01:11:43,057
and it makes it go
this great green.

792
01:11:43,127 --> 01:11:46,392
Why aren't you peeing
on them yourself?

793
01:11:46,463 --> 01:11:48,727
l don't like beer.

794
01:12:00,411 --> 01:12:03,710
Can l get some caviar, please?

795
01:12:06,083 --> 01:12:08,017
Oh, can l taste it first?

796
01:12:20,864 --> 01:12:25,233
- ls that the best you have?
- Yes, it's the best.

797
01:12:25,302 --> 01:12:29,398
- l'll take the whole tin.
- That's $3,000.

798
01:12:29,473 --> 01:12:31,998
Hey, Andy.
Can l get $3,000?

799
01:12:32,075 --> 01:12:34,373
For this caviar?

800
01:12:35,746 --> 01:12:39,512
Jean, we could go
to Russia for that.

801
01:12:39,583 --> 01:12:42,916
Put the caviar on the card
and l'll get the rest.

802
01:12:49,993 --> 01:12:52,154
Do you check everybody's bills
or just mine?

803
01:12:52,229 --> 01:12:53,321
Just yours.

804
01:12:55,499 --> 01:12:58,059
Just gimme my shit, man.

805
01:12:58,135 --> 01:13:00,262
Yeah, but what he said
was locked in the basement...

806
01:13:00,337 --> 01:13:02,532
you know, l mean,
it had such a nasty ring to it.

807
01:13:02,606 --> 01:13:06,940
lf l was white, they would have
just said ''artist in residence''.

808
01:13:07,010 --> 01:13:10,104
l just wish they'd quit
writing shit about me.

809
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:13,946
No, Jean, that's good.
At least they're interested.

810
01:13:14,017 --> 01:13:16,076
And then,
everyone's payin', like...

811
01:13:16,153 --> 01:13:18,485
top dollar for...

812
01:13:18,555 --> 01:13:20,489
anything with Samo on it.

813
01:13:20,557 --> 01:13:24,789
- Scraps of paper, refrigerator doors.
- Sure, yeah.

814
01:13:24,862 --> 01:13:28,093
The other day, l wanted to buy
a pack of cigarettes...

815
01:13:28,165 --> 01:13:30,258
so l did this drawing
for two dollars...

816
01:13:30,334 --> 01:13:33,030
and this gallery called me
a week later said...

817
01:13:33,103 --> 01:13:36,903
''Somebody's offering us $5,000
for the same drawing, should l buy it?''

818
01:13:36,974 --> 01:13:40,102
l said, ''Yeah, sure, buy it.
lt sounds like a good deal to me''.

819
01:13:40,177 --> 01:13:42,611
Sure, buy it,
that's a good deal, yeah.

820
01:13:42,679 --> 01:13:44,943
But you've got to stop
giving them away!

821
01:13:45,015 --> 01:13:49,611
You know? Oh, Comme Des Garcons
want me to, like, model for them.

822
01:13:49,686 --> 01:13:51,984
Maybe you could do that with me.

823
01:13:52,055 --> 01:13:54,080
Yeah, yeah. l could do that.

824
01:13:54,157 --> 01:13:56,990
You could teach me.

825
01:13:57,060 --> 01:13:59,620
l couldn't teach you anything.

826
01:13:59,696 --> 01:14:01,630
You're a natural.

827
01:14:01,698 --> 01:14:03,825
You kidding me?

828
01:14:03,901 --> 01:14:06,734
Maybe you could join
my modeling agency.

829
01:14:08,171 --> 01:14:11,265
They asked me to do the Mike Todd Room
at the Palladium. Should l do that?

830
01:14:11,341 --> 01:14:13,536
lsn't Albert Milo doing that?

831
01:14:13,610 --> 01:14:16,078
- They asked him before they asked me?
- Gee, l don't know.

832
01:14:16,146 --> 01:14:18,614
Shit, l'm not doing that.

833
01:14:20,117 --> 01:14:22,108
l gotta get out of New York.

834
01:14:23,887 --> 01:14:28,586
Hey, we could go to Pittsburgh!
l kinda grew up there.

835
01:14:28,659 --> 01:14:32,186
They have this room there with
all the world's famous statues in.

836
01:14:32,262 --> 01:14:34,321
So you don't even have
to go to Europe anymore.

837
01:14:34,398 --> 01:14:36,559
Just go to Pittsburgh.

838
01:14:36,633 --> 01:14:39,295
- Boom! Duckman!
- Oh, yeah.

839
01:14:41,338 --> 01:14:46,071
When l was little,
my brother and l had two pet ducks.

840
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:47,974
We called them
the Garcia brothers.

841
01:14:51,214 --> 01:14:54,706
Jean, did you see
my dermatologist yet?

842
01:14:56,954 --> 01:14:58,444
Say, Gina, Gina!

843
01:15:00,691 --> 01:15:04,024
l'm sorry.
l thought you were a friend.

844
01:15:06,697 --> 01:15:10,690
Welcome back to Barbetta, maestro.

845
01:15:10,767 --> 01:15:14,225
Haven't seen you in long time.
How was your show in Europe?

846
01:15:14,304 --> 01:15:16,704
- lt was good.
- Good.

847
01:15:20,744 --> 01:15:23,304
We have an excellent
Brunero Di Mont-al-Cino.

848
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:25,905
- What year? Sure.
- '73.

849
01:15:28,518 --> 01:15:30,816
So how are you doing?

850
01:15:30,887 --> 01:15:33,515
l was gonna get you some flowers.
l forgot.

851
01:15:37,628 --> 01:15:40,392
So, l hear you've been
hanging out with Andy.

852
01:15:40,464 --> 01:15:42,557
He seems like
he's pretty weird.

853
01:15:42,633 --> 01:15:45,101
He's not, you know. He calls me
every day when he's out of town.

854
01:15:45,168 --> 01:15:46,999
What's weird about him?

855
01:15:47,070 --> 01:15:49,937
Well, you know, a lot of people
think that he's using you.

856
01:15:51,508 --> 01:15:54,602
Why does everyone say that?
He's the only person who doesn't need--

857
01:15:56,947 --> 01:15:58,881
Never mind.

858
01:16:15,032 --> 01:16:16,966
So, what have you been up to?

859
01:16:19,569 --> 01:16:22,094
Well, l'm starting med school
at Columbia in the fall.

860
01:16:22,172 --> 01:16:23,764
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

861
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:26,707
Pretty excited about it, actually.

862
01:16:26,777 --> 01:16:29,940
And Rene hired me as his secretary.
He's getting his poems published.

863
01:16:30,013 --> 01:16:33,710
l hate him.
How is he?

864
01:16:33,784 --> 01:16:35,979
He's the same.

865
01:16:48,065 --> 01:16:49,498
That's fine.

866
01:17:06,950 --> 01:17:09,145
- Giorgio?
- Yes, Mr. Basquiat?

867
01:17:09,219 --> 01:17:11,551
- You see this table behind me?
- Yes.

868
01:17:11,621 --> 01:17:13,589
Put their bill on my tab.

869
01:17:13,657 --> 01:17:15,989
All right.

870
01:17:16,059 --> 01:17:18,550
- Giorgio.
- Yes, Mr. Basquiat?

871
01:17:18,628 --> 01:17:20,687
Don't tell them anything.
Just do it, please.

872
01:17:20,764 --> 01:17:22,925
Of course not, Mr. Basquiat.

873
01:17:24,034 --> 01:17:27,128
- Why?
- l mean, what year is this?

874
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:40,006
l think about you a lot, you know.

875
01:17:40,083 --> 01:17:44,679
And me, and the future 'cause--

876
01:17:46,723 --> 01:17:49,692
l'm gonna--

877
01:17:53,029 --> 01:17:55,998
ln my head, l had all these things
l was gonna say...

878
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,334
but they don't work.

879
01:18:05,842 --> 01:18:08,242
l'm sorry--

880
01:18:08,311 --> 01:18:12,805
- l'm sorry--
- You don't need to be sorry.

881
01:18:18,155 --> 01:18:21,750
Well, you know, one good thing
came out of it.

882
01:18:21,825 --> 01:18:25,124
l realized
l'm a really bad painter.

883
01:18:25,195 --> 01:18:28,096
lt was a relief.

884
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:33,060
l'm glad l could help.

885
01:18:38,441 --> 01:18:39,840
l have to go to the bathroom.

886
01:19:38,401 --> 01:19:41,393
Well, gee, Jean.
That was my favorite part.

887
01:19:47,410 --> 01:19:51,312
lt needed more white.
That's better.

888
01:19:51,381 --> 01:19:55,613
You make me feel so worthless.

889
01:19:55,685 --> 01:19:58,313
You're so famous now.

890
01:19:59,756 --> 01:20:01,951
Famous.

891
01:20:02,025 --> 01:20:05,859
l don't even have any friends anymore,
aside from you.

892
01:20:05,929 --> 01:20:08,796
And everyone says...

893
01:20:08,865 --> 01:20:11,129
''Warhol, that...

894
01:20:11,201 --> 01:20:15,365
death-warmed-over person on drugs,
he's just using you''.

895
01:20:38,361 --> 01:20:41,819
Well, maybe you just shouldn't
take things so seriously.

896
01:20:43,166 --> 01:20:44,827
Bruno called.

897
01:20:44,901 --> 01:20:48,837
He said people in Europe are saying
you're burning your candle at both ends.

898
01:20:48,905 --> 01:20:52,204
Well, l think it's awful
people are talking like that.

899
01:20:52,275 --> 01:20:56,541
l think you should, like, l don't know,
stick around, prove them wrong.

900
01:20:57,447 --> 01:21:00,280
No one thought l could make it
in the first place.

901
01:21:02,652 --> 01:21:05,883
Then when it happened, they said,
yeah, but he'll never keep it up.

902
01:21:08,158 --> 01:21:10,217
Now they say l'm killing myself.
Stuff like this.

903
01:21:12,095 --> 01:21:16,259
But then when l clean up,
they say, look, his art's dead.

904
01:21:22,005 --> 01:21:25,771
l don't care anyway, because,
you know, l'm clean now. l'm healthy.

905
01:21:25,842 --> 01:21:30,836
That's just not true, Jean.
You phone me at 4:00 in the--

906
01:21:30,914 --> 01:21:35,112
What are you doing?
You're painting out everything l do!

907
01:21:37,487 --> 01:21:40,251
Wow.

908
01:21:40,323 --> 01:21:44,020
Oh, that's great.
System with just the ''M''.

909
01:21:53,169 --> 01:21:55,694
Yeah, it's better.

910
01:21:57,874 --> 01:22:00,741
You really think so?

911
01:22:00,810 --> 01:22:02,243
God.

912
01:22:06,983 --> 01:22:09,076
l can't even see
what's good anymore.

913
01:22:11,354 --> 01:22:14,152
Okay, l see what you mean
about that white.

914
01:22:14,224 --> 01:22:16,749
After the show,
let's take a nice long vacation.

915
01:22:16,826 --> 01:22:19,317
Go to Hawaii.
You want to go to Hawaii?

916
01:22:22,699 --> 01:22:27,136
That's what l'm gonna do.
l'm gonna go to Maui...

917
01:22:27,203 --> 01:22:29,330
open a tequila factory...

918
01:22:29,406 --> 01:22:32,534
write poetry,
play music again.

919
01:22:34,911 --> 01:22:36,879
Give up this painting.

920
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:42,377
l wanna sing.

921
01:22:42,452 --> 01:22:45,114
Boy, that would be a pity.

922
01:22:45,188 --> 01:22:47,315
You're a real painter.

923
01:22:57,133 --> 01:23:00,967
Poster came out great.
Jean Michel sent this.

924
01:23:02,605 --> 01:23:04,197
Great.

925
01:23:35,572 --> 01:23:37,733
Hey, that's mine.

926
01:23:37,807 --> 01:23:41,072
- What's up?
- Mind your own business.

927
01:23:41,144 --> 01:23:44,079
Yeah, my man Samo
gonna make us rich.

928
01:23:45,915 --> 01:23:49,351
Hey?
What is your problem?

929
01:23:49,419 --> 01:23:51,353
Now it's worth more.

930
01:24:02,165 --> 01:24:05,032
- l'm Samo.
- What did he say?

931
01:24:05,101 --> 01:24:07,160
- He says he's Samo.
- l'm Samo.

932
01:24:56,386 --> 01:24:58,320
Jean Michel...

933
01:24:58,388 --> 01:25:01,414
crawling from the wreckage.

934
01:25:01,491 --> 01:25:04,892
- l need a dealer.
- Don't you have a bunch of them already?

935
01:25:07,630 --> 01:25:11,566
Hey, Mary Boone, did l ever tell you
my grandfather was an oyster man?

936
01:25:11,634 --> 01:25:13,625
You know what that means?

937
01:25:13,703 --> 01:25:15,830
Mary, can we switch these?

938
01:25:15,905 --> 01:25:17,839
This should be here.

939
01:25:17,907 --> 01:25:20,842
You should see it when you walk in.
That should be there.

940
01:25:20,910 --> 01:25:24,038
- Hi, Jean. You know?
- l like it there.

941
01:25:24,113 --> 01:25:27,105
- Could we switch 'em? Yeah?
- Well, yes.

942
01:25:27,183 --> 01:25:30,914
- We'll rehang them.
- That's good. That's good there.

943
01:25:39,529 --> 01:25:40,996
So what do you think?
l said l need a dealer.

944
01:25:41,064 --> 01:25:43,032
- We could talk about it.
- Here l am.

945
01:25:43,099 --> 01:25:47,433
No. l'll come by your studio.
Thursday at 3:30.

946
01:25:47,503 --> 01:25:49,437
What are you doin'?

947
01:25:49,505 --> 01:25:52,235
- Nothin'.
- Wanna come over?

948
01:25:52,308 --> 01:25:55,539
- What for?
- l'm your friend.

949
01:25:59,048 --> 01:26:02,643
- See you in an hour.
- Good. All right.

950
01:26:07,290 --> 01:26:10,350
- So, what's wrong with tomorrow?
- l'm busy! l'm busy!

951
01:26:10,426 --> 01:26:12,360
Okay?
l'll come by your studio.

952
01:26:12,428 --> 01:26:14,521
- Thursday at 3:30.
- 3:30. Yeah, yeah.

953
01:26:14,597 --> 01:26:17,225
l'll fit you in.

954
01:26:19,435 --> 01:26:21,528
Yeah, l might even
make you some gumbo.

955
01:26:27,577 --> 01:26:31,069
Excuse me.
ls this gallery open?

956
01:26:31,147 --> 01:26:35,709
Yeah.
No, please come back later.

957
01:26:41,391 --> 01:26:44,849
You like that painting?

958
01:26:44,927 --> 01:26:47,395
l painted that for a friend
of mine who died.

959
01:26:51,167 --> 01:26:53,260
Okay, that's good,
that's good.

960
01:27:00,310 --> 01:27:03,677
Hey, Jean.
Hang on. Jean.

961
01:27:03,746 --> 01:27:08,945
This is a backdrop
for the Kabuki theater in Japan.

962
01:27:09,018 --> 01:27:10,610
Sort of a...

963
01:27:11,487 --> 01:27:12,954
rebirth painting.

964
01:27:13,022 --> 01:27:16,048
l painted it for Joseph Beuys.

965
01:27:16,125 --> 01:27:17,717
Felt like maybe he could
have painted it...

966
01:27:17,794 --> 01:27:21,594
or someone else was painting it
instead of me.

967
01:27:21,664 --> 01:27:23,461
l like it, it's good. Thanks.

968
01:27:25,802 --> 01:27:27,429
l'll be up in about ten minutes.

969
01:27:30,239 --> 01:27:32,366
- Cortes.
- l know it.

970
01:27:32,442 --> 01:27:34,239
- You know? You know Cortes?
- Of course.

971
01:27:34,310 --> 01:27:38,076
Here. You know
the Chinese calligraphers?

972
01:27:38,147 --> 01:27:41,082
They used to change
their name mid-career...

973
01:27:41,150 --> 01:27:43,744
so they could start over
as someone else.

974
01:28:11,314 --> 01:28:14,010
- Do you ever get sick of it?
- What, spaghetti?

975
01:28:14,083 --> 01:28:17,917
No, the whole thing.
Painting.

976
01:28:21,324 --> 01:28:23,792
That's one of the few things
that makes me happy.

977
01:28:23,860 --> 01:28:25,953
- Spaghetti?
- No, painting.

978
01:28:26,028 --> 01:28:30,124
l used to cook for a living.
That l got sick of.

979
01:28:30,199 --> 01:28:32,861
You know, l still have a rash
from those white bucks?

980
01:28:36,906 --> 01:28:41,366
Hey, Eddie,
are we still on the lapdog remark?

981
01:28:41,444 --> 01:28:44,072
That's completely different, though.
l think Eddie Murphy's cool, you know?

982
01:28:44,147 --> 01:28:47,048
Yeah, but he can't paint.
Not that l know of.

983
01:28:47,116 --> 01:28:50,745
- What about stupidity they write?
- Let me tell you something.

984
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:53,288
There's about ten people
on the planet...

985
01:28:53,356 --> 01:28:57,690
who know anything about painting,
and Andy is one of them.

986
01:28:59,295 --> 01:29:02,787
You know, your audience
isn't even born yet.

987
01:29:05,168 --> 01:29:09,798
Personally, l'm surprised
when anybody comes to my openings.

988
01:29:13,109 --> 01:29:15,270
l haven't felt like talking to him
since that thing came out.

989
01:29:15,344 --> 01:29:17,869
l mean, l'm nobody's mascot, you know?

990
01:29:17,947 --> 01:29:20,177
- Did he say that?
- As long as l've known Andy...

991
01:29:20,249 --> 01:29:23,047
he never asked me for a thing,
except to speak to you...

992
01:29:23,119 --> 01:29:24,984
about getting off drugs.

993
01:29:25,054 --> 01:29:28,717
And he's painted my picture,
l've painted his picture...

994
01:29:28,791 --> 01:29:31,351
you know,
we've eaten dinner together.

995
01:29:31,427 --> 01:29:33,554
He doesn't care about me.
He cares about you.

996
01:29:33,629 --> 01:29:36,063
You're the one he cares about.
You're his friend.

997
01:29:36,132 --> 01:29:39,363
- Did he say that?
- Listen, forget that article!

998
01:29:39,435 --> 01:29:43,064
lt doesn't matter.
Forget about it.

999
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:46,233
Come on, eat.

1000
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:53,578
Good conversation is hard to find
in this town.

1001
01:29:58,387 --> 01:30:00,912
Papa, the TV's broken.
Can you fix it?

1002
01:30:02,225 --> 01:30:04,785
Sure, honey.
l'll be there in a minute.

1003
01:30:08,464 --> 01:30:11,956
She knows more about painting
than Eddie Murphy.

1004
01:30:28,351 --> 01:30:30,376
Your hair was different
the last time l saw you.

1005
01:30:31,521 --> 01:30:33,921
lt's nice.

1006
01:30:33,990 --> 01:30:35,548
Do you like your dad's paintings?

1007
01:30:35,625 --> 01:30:37,559
Some of'em.

1008
01:30:43,533 --> 01:30:45,626
Stand still, Stella.

1009
01:30:49,505 --> 01:30:51,598
You can keep it.

1010
01:30:51,674 --> 01:30:53,107
Thanks.

1011
01:31:13,696 --> 01:31:15,527
You're much prettier than that.

1012
01:31:17,733 --> 01:31:20,531
- Where'd Jean go?
- He just left.

1013
01:31:20,603 --> 01:31:22,036
He did?

1014
01:31:43,159 --> 01:31:45,593

<i>Willie Mays. Willie Mays.</i>

Hey, Benny.
My mom told me this story.

1045
01:40:34,690 --> 01:40:36,624
Or was it a dream?

1046
01:40:38,093 --> 01:40:41,153
There was this little prince
with a magic crown.

1047
01:40:41,230 --> 01:40:45,064
<i>And this evil warlock
kidnapped him.</i>

1048
01:40:45,134 --> 01:40:49,503
<i>Locked him in this cell in this
huge tower. Took away his voice.</i>

1049
01:40:49,571 --> 01:40:52,972
<i>There was a window with bars...</i>

1050
01:40:53,041 --> 01:40:55,737
<i>and the prince kept smashing his head
against the bars...</i>

1051
01:40:55,811 --> 01:40:59,713
<i>hoping that someone
would hear the sound...</i>

1052
01:40:59,781 --> 01:41:02,215
<i>and find him.</i>

1053
01:41:04,453 --> 01:41:08,014
<i>The crown made the most beautiful sound
that anyone had ever heard.</i>

1054
01:41:10,259 --> 01:41:13,558
<i>You could hear it ringing for miles.</i>

1055
01:41:13,629 --> 01:41:15,824
<i>lt was so beautiful.</i>

1056
01:41:15,898 --> 01:41:18,059
<i>The people wanted
to grab the air.</i>

1057
01:41:20,469 --> 01:41:22,767
<i>They never found the prince.</i>

1058
01:41:24,006 --> 01:41:27,032
<i>He never got out of the room.</i>

1059
01:41:27,109 --> 01:41:30,840
<i>But that sound he made...</i>

1060
01:41:30,913 --> 01:41:33,211
<i>filled everything up with beauty.</i>

1061
01:41:38,654 --> 01:41:40,918
<i>lt's definitely time
to get out of here.</i>

1062
01:41:46,728 --> 01:41:49,162
Benny, forget Hawaii.

1063
01:41:49,231 --> 01:41:51,165
Let's go to lreland.

1064
01:41:51,233 --> 01:41:53,997
We'll stop in every bar
and have a drink.
