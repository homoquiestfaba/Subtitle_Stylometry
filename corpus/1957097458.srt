00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:07,919
Hi.

7
00:01:09,954 --> 00:01:10,888
What's your name?

8
00:01:12,824 --> 00:01:13,825
What's yours?

9
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:16,994
I'm Norris.

10
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:19,063
Hi, Norris.

11
00:01:21,065 --> 00:01:21,899
And your name?

12
00:01:25,535 --> 00:01:28,840
You'll have to buy a round
if you wanna know my name.

13
00:01:28,873 --> 00:01:32,676
(CHUCKLES) I already have.

14
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:38,816
So the first time I came home
wasted I was about your age.

15
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:42,153
What's your age, by the way?

16
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:43,020
18.

17
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,456

00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:47,925
I am.

19
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:50,895
I was barely able to
walk and my mom was there,

20
00:01:51,896 --> 00:01:54,631
and I went into the
kitchen and I just puked.

21
00:01:54,664 --> 00:01:55,867
I mean everywhere (CHUCKLES).

help her clean it,

23
00:01:59,904 --> 00:02:04,775

you still a virgin?"

00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:12,716

"In times like
this, I wish I was."

That's good, kid, as

I'm watching you.

00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:28,205
Hi, my name is
Dr. Julia Kentyl,

49
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:31,674
and I'm a brain researcher
and neuroscientist.

50
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,811
I thank you for your time.

51
00:06:33,844 --> 00:06:38,849
I want to, I would like
to scan your brain,

52
00:06:41,252 --> 00:06:46,257
do an fMRI and
some tests to see,

53
00:06:47,424 --> 00:06:52,163
excuse me, to see if your
brain is consistent with other.

54
00:06:57,768 --> 00:07:00,905
I understand you like it black.

55
00:07:08,112 --> 00:07:13,050
So yes, I would like to take
some images of your brain,

56
00:07:15,085 --> 00:07:20,090
and probably if, if
that's all right with you,

57
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:22,893
do an electroencephalogram.

58
00:07:24,295 --> 00:07:26,130
And electro what?

59
00:07:26,163 --> 00:07:30,000
Electroencephalogram,
also called an EEG.

60
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:32,903
Brain cells communicate
with each other

61
00:07:32,937 --> 00:07:34,737
through electrical impulses.

62
00:07:38,108 --> 00:07:40,811
So that's how we're gonna
communicate here today.

63
00:07:41,512 --> 00:07:42,346
Excuse me?

64
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:48,819

After years of research,

67
00:08:05,135 --> 00:08:08,872
we may have a clear
picture of why some,

68
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:12,076
some people don't have emotions.

69
00:08:13,043 --> 00:08:17,147
Of why some people can't control
their, their impulsivity.

70
00:08:20,951 --> 00:08:24,021
I have read all about
your early years.

71
00:08:25,155 --> 00:08:29,126
You see, to understand if
someone has an emotional disorder

72
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:31,295
you need to examine them
throughout their life.

73
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:39,303
And so I want your consent
to run these tests.

74
00:08:43,073 --> 00:08:47,077
Look, Doctor, that's
really nice of you

bringing me coffee
and everything,

76
00:08:50,047 --> 00:08:55,419
but the truth is I, I don't
believe in this psychobabble.

77
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,088
This is not psychology, sir.

78
00:08:58,122 --> 00:08:59,323

visit, I really am,

very interested.

a little more time.

88
00:09:39,363 --> 00:09:43,834
like I'm their celebrated
pet, an experiment?

89
00:09:46,537 --> 00:09:47,938
Just one hour.

90
00:09:49,373 --> 00:09:53,544

have 52 minutes.

91
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:58,315

you chocolate too.

scan is so important.

97
00:10:31,582 --> 00:10:34,351
You know what I
love about this place?

98
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:36,453
It's the four seasons
that look like one.

99
00:10:37,955 --> 00:10:39,156
I know.

100
00:10:39,189 --> 00:10:41,525
Yeah, I like my spring
and summer with rain.

101
00:10:42,526 --> 00:10:44,228
It calms me.

102
00:10:44,261 --> 00:10:46,630
Hmm, you know how mythology

103
00:10:46,663 --> 00:10:48,565
gave meaning to
the four seasons?

104
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:51,001
(CHUCKLES) I think
I skipped that class.

105
00:10:52,469 --> 00:10:54,571
Well, it was about
the mysterious rape

106
00:10:54,605 --> 00:10:56,173
and abduction of Persephone.

107
00:10:57,174 --> 00:11:00,377
Sounds sexy.

108
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:04,148
Mm hmm, well,
Demeter was the goddess

109
00:11:04,181 --> 00:11:06,283
of agriculture and soil,

110
00:11:06,316 --> 00:11:09,353
and she had one beautiful
daughter called Persephone

111
00:11:09,386 --> 00:11:11,555
whom was growing to be
quite the young woman.

112
00:11:12,723 --> 00:11:14,958
And those male gods
had their eyes on her.

113
00:11:14,992 --> 00:11:17,261
DANNY: Hmm,
those naughty gods.

114
00:11:17,294 --> 00:11:18,395
Indeed, mm hmm.

115
00:11:20,531 --> 00:11:22,199
Can you put your
hand there, thanks.

116
00:11:22,232 --> 00:11:25,369
So Demeter would take her
for walks in the countryside.

117
00:11:25,402 --> 00:11:28,205
Someone was always secretly
lurking and lusting

118
00:11:28,238 --> 00:11:29,606
for that young woman.

119
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,441

00:11:30,474 --> 00:11:31,508

the king of the
underworld at that.

123
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,084
One day the skies darkened,

124
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,655
and the earth tore in half,

125
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:48,692
and Pluto emerged
from the darkness.

126
00:11:48,725 --> 00:11:51,261
Abducted the young
woman to the underworld.

127
00:11:52,262 --> 00:11:55,365
He wanted her kindness and
spirit to light up the darkness.

128
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:57,734
Then what?

129
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:00,437
Well, Demeter grew desperate,

130
00:12:02,072 --> 00:12:04,174
and her depression
caused the crops to die.

131
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:07,311
Hunger spread amongst
all the workers.

132
00:12:08,378 --> 00:12:10,414
DANNY: So it's not only
the government's fault.

133
00:12:10,447 --> 00:12:14,151
(CHUCKLES) No, it's
not, but let me finish.

134
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,255
Zeus and the other
gods had to mediate,

135
00:12:18,288 --> 00:12:20,524
and Pluto agreed to
release her every year

136
00:12:20,557 --> 00:12:23,560
for the spring and summer
under one condition.

137
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:29,233
Persephone had to live with him
through the fall and winter.

138
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:33,470
Are you like a
professor or something?

139
00:12:34,605 --> 00:12:36,673
(CHUCKLES) No.

use some sleep.

143

Oh, me too.

144
00:13:07,538 --> 00:13:08,705
Can you stay still?

145
00:13:10,407 --> 00:13:11,375
Like how still?

146
00:13:12,777 --> 00:13:14,044
Like that still.

147
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,214
DANNY: Is this a role?

148
00:13:20,484 --> 00:13:21,518
NORRIS: It's a choice.

149
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,458
You know from the
first time I met you,

150
00:13:28,492 --> 00:13:31,328
I had this, this feeling.

151
00:13:34,431 --> 00:13:35,265
Me too.

152
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:41,071
Like a chill, your eyes.

153
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:44,776
What about them?

154
00:13:46,643 --> 00:13:51,281
They're empty.

the term exists?

It's not new.

158
00:14:07,531 --> 00:14:09,566
Aristotle's disciple,
Theophrastus,

159
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,737
was the first one to describe
a psychopath a tormented soul.

160
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:16,808
Now that I believe,

161
00:14:18,642 --> 00:14:22,212
but I don't believe the
sociopathy bullshit.

162
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,717
Sociopathy is not Psychopathy.

163
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,387
One is the result of antisocial
behavior due to trauma.

164
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,489
Psychopathy is about the genetic

165
00:14:32,522 --> 00:14:34,458
and biologic makeup
of the brain.
