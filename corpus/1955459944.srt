1
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,643
<i>I was an elite soldier
in the vampire army.</i>

2
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,437
<i>A Death Dealer.</i>

3
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,648
<i>And I was good at it.</i>

4
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,694
<i>But I was betrayed.</i>

5
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:13,656
<i>Viktor, our leader
and the most powerful vampire...</i>

6
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:16,701
<i>was not the savior
he had led me to believe.</i>

7
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,081
<i>Suddenly, allies turned enemies.</i>

8
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:25,460
<i>The vampire Elders I had once protected
wanted me dead.</i>

9
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,964
<i>Then I found Michael Corvin.</i>

10
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:34,135
<i>Neither vampire nor Lycan,
Michael became a hybrid.</i>

11
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:38,640
<i>We retaliated, killed the Elders.</i>

12
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,603
<i>But then everything changed.</i>

13
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,692
<i>I was captured, not knowing that I was
carrying Michael's child.</i>

14
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,820
<i>Eve, our daughter,
the first pure-blood hybrid...</i>

15
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,239
<i>whose blood could end the war...</i>

16
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:57,826
<i>became highly sought after
by both vampires and Lycans alike.</i>

17
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:06,918
<i>My only choice was to hide her
from the world and from myself...</i>

18
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,753
<i>so not even I could lead them to her.</i>

19
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:15,593
<i>I was an elite soldier
in the vampire army.</i>

20
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:23,101
<i>My only choice was to hide her
from the world...</i>

21
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:27,439
<i>so not even I could lead them to her.</i>

22
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:44,873
<i>I have lived beyond my time.</i>

23
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,835
<i>Another new moon
in 1000 years of new moons...</i>

24
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,173
<i>and I do not care to see it.</i>

25
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,053
<i>I have nothing.</i>

26
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,763
<i>My coven...</i>

27
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,807
<i>my daughter...</i>

28
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,893
<i>- my love, all gone.</i>
- Cut her off!

29
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,063
<i>And soon, perhaps...</i>

30
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,398
<i>my very existence.</i>

31
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,150
- Selene's coming!
<i>- I am hunted...</i>

32
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,527
<i>by vampires and Lycans.</i>

33
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:19,366
<i>Now I am an outcast, a pariah.</i>

34
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:32,837
- Put her down!
- Remember, he wants her alive.

35
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,047
Fire!

36
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,636
Come on, now. Fire!

37
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,987
You are an extremely difficult person
to keep track of.

38
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,530
I don't need you.

39
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,324
But thank you.

40
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,617
Any word with Michael?

41
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,911
- Stop tracking me!
- I'm not tracking you.

42
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,330
I'm looking for Eve.

43
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,959
Well, I'm the very last person
who could help you find my daughter.

44
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,212
Selene, listen to me.
The Lycans are moving again.

45
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:57,839
No, this is different.

46
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,383
They're organized.
They have a new leader.

47
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,550
- His name is Marius.
- I'm finished with this war.

48
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:03,914
Well, it's not finished with you.

49
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,214
They could have killed you...

50
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,724
but clearly their mission
was to capture you.

51
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,727
Your daughter's blood, it's a prize.

52
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,812
And if they find her, if they use it...

53
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:17,359
- Marius's power will be limitless.
- Well, then I hope she remains lost.

54
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,449
I need you to deliver a message.

55
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,701
Grunt if you understand.

56
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,286
Tell your Marius...

57
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,431
if he thinks he can extract information
from me...

58
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,165
to locate my daughter, he can't.

59
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,501
I don't know where she is,
and I don't want to know.

60
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,252
Marius will find you.

61
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,132
Do you understand your message?

62
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,977
What is it?

63
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,355
Have you seen this before?

64
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,815
No...

65
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,483
but we need to get it out.

66
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,988
Let's go.

67
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,259
<i>Bravo one, over. Car approaching.</i>

68
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,761
<i>- Access cleared.
- Close the gates.</i>

69
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,725
<i>Commencing perimeter sweep.</i>

70
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:49,492
Privilege to welcome you home at last, sir.

71
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,745
Semira awaits you
in her private chambers.

72
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,663
Semira?

73
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,290
Where is Cassius?

74
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:57,268
The entire council will greet you,
of course, sir...

75
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:00,587
but Semira requests
just a few moments.

76
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,297
And your name is?

77
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:03,882
Varga, sir.

78
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,092
I shall try to remember it.

79
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,574
And act accordingly
because of this tragic...

80
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,368
Leave us.

81
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:38,041
Darling Thomas. It has been...

82
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,585
- how long?
- Decades.

83
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,420
Congratulations.

84
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,065
I gather you have a seat
on the council.

85
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,548
I could not be more proud.

86
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:50,178
It's a shame that your return is not under
more festive circumstances.

87
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:53,431
It is said that the Western Coven
was utterly destroyed.

88
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,724
Yes, it was.

89
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,851
It's a blessing
you escaped with your life.

90
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,688
Well, many did not.

91
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,190
There has been too much death
among our people.

92
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:05,360
These urns are all that remain
of our Budapest Coven.

93
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,487
Well, you have my condolences.

94
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,824
We are losing the war, Thomas.

95
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,285
If we stay as we are, our species
will be extinct within five years.

96
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,037
Does Cassius share your view?

97
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:20,000
The Lycans have regrouped, replenished,
and are resolved to exterminate us.

98
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,086
Oh, surely, you're safe here.
The Eastern Coven is a fortress.

99
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,380
We are no longer
the coven you remember.

100
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,757
We have fewer Death Dealers
than ever before.

101
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,176
You seem to be surrounded
by new cadets.

102
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,555
Raw recruits, neither combat-ready
nor numerous enough...

103
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,640
to repel a large-scale Lycan attack.

104
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,686
There has never been
a large-scale Lycan attack.

105
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,397
At least not a coordinated one.

106
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,233
There has never been a Marius.

107
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,612
Pains me to admit it,
but for the first time in my life...

108
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,282
I genuinely fear for our future.

109
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,285
So, what is your plan?

110
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,622
Semira, you always have a plan.

111
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:03,376
This little mise-en-scene
you're performing has a purpose.

112
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,836
I am not a mind reader.

113
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,838
Kindly do an old vampire the courtesy...

114
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:10,383
of telling him why
he's been invited here.

115
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,097
Selene.

116
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,766
Come on. We need to keep moving.

117
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,268
There are safe houses
far closer than this.

118
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,312
I told you, they destroyed them.

119
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,230
It's different now. Come on.

120
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,568
But you signed her death warrant.

121
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,820
Of course. I despise her.

122
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:32,697
She killed Viktor. I was his regent.

123
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:35,408
Until he met Selene.

124
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,660
So you want her to hunt Marius?

125
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,454
I want her to train our new recruits...

126
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:42,540
so we have 100 Death Dealers
hunting Marius.

127
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,126
I doubt she will agree.

128
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,003
Her only concern is for her daughter.

129
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,380
Eve, the hybrid.

130
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,466
Unfortunately, the poor girl is half Lycan.

131
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,028
It's a vampire's instinct
to condescend to Lycans...

132
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,720
but they're not afraid to evolve.

133
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:58,473
Meanwhile,
we stagnate from 1500 years...

134
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,810
of this damned "species purity"
nonsense.

135
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,020
And the irony is that Selene...

136
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,898
- is probably the purest of us all.
- So the rumor's true?

137
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,442
Her blood has elements
of the Corvinus strain?

138
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,486
She is special.

139
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,948
She brought my son back
from the dead.

140
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:19,285
- Her blood restarted his heart.
- Impossible.

141
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,457
I witnessed it myself.
She saved my son's life.

142
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,628
Viktor and Amelia.

143
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:32,132
Side by side for eternity.

144
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:37,971
You were very fond of Amelia,
if I remember.

145
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:43,727
- I need you to be my ally on this.
- She won't risk coming here...

146
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,521
unless she gets an invitation
from the whole council.

147
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,773
And I could never solicit such a request.

148
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,900
Cassius is protective of the old ways.

149
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,237
He barely tolerates my seat
on the council as it is.

150
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,532
But these are desperate times, Thomas.

151
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:01,453
And that is why you
must convince the council to invite her.

152
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,330
They arrive tonight.

153
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,667
<i>Dawn alert.
60 seconds to sunrise.</i>

154
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:38,907
Marius, the pack leaders have arrived...

155
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:41,493
and I told them to wait
for you in the war room.

156
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,139
They're fighting like dogs, no doubt.

157
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,705
- I'll handle it. Thank you.
- All right.

158
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,795
- Go on, then.
- Right, right.

159
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:52,962
Come around, come around.

160
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,714
No! Listen to me.

161
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,925
We're gonna wedge them in.
That's what we do.

162
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:58,986
From this side and that side,
we just wedge them in...

163
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,650
- and squeeze them out.
- Wedge them in?

164
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,473
Is that your plan?
It's not going to lead to anything.

165
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,974
- He's getting angry.
- Shut up!

166
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,519
Stop!

167
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,483
- Are you a slave?
- No.

168
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,235
Then don't behave like one.

169
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,655
Look at this map.

170
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:20,448
What do you see?

171
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:22,492
Do you see Lycans
fighting over scraps?

172
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,995
I'll tell you what I see.

173
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:27,914
Volhynia.

174
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:31,042
Nordgau. Thuringia.

175
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,293
The Lycan victories.

176
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,630
I see vampires dead.

177
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,340
I see entire regions annihilated.

178
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,884
But we will get no further
if we fight amongst ourselves.

179
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,220
We must not rest...

180
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:45,765
until we have destroyed
their final sanctuary.

181
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:49,227
Together, we are strong.

182
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,690
And when we have the blood
of the hybrid girl...

183
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,652
we will be invincible.

184
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,203
Gregor.

185
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,540
You have returned alone.

186
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,127
- We were taken by surprise.
- Where is Selene?

187
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,005
- She spared me.
- Why?

188
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:18,590
To deliver a message.

189
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,719
She wants you to know
that her daughter is gone forever...

190
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:24,429
that you can never find her...

191
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:27,432
because even Selene
doesn't know where she's been hidden.

192
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:28,725
Do you believe her?

193
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:34,439
Do you believe her?

194
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:43,823
I put a tracer in her companion.

195
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:46,868
Well...

196
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:50,955
that means you're not
completely incompetent.

197
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,680
Try and stay still.

198
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,186
- What is it?
- It's some sort of bullet.

199
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,106
It's burrowing through you
faster than you can heal.

200
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,565
It's self-propelled.

201
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:21,152
That's what I was trying to tell you.
These Lycans are sophisticated.

202
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,282
I don't know if I can remove it in time.

203
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,730
Well, the least you can do
is attempt to sound reassuring.

204
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,870
I'm going to attempt not to kill you.

205
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,832
That will have to do.

206
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:11,911
To whom do you want us
to offer safe haven and amnesty?

207
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,665
- To Selene the Death Dealer.
- The same Selene who murdered Viktor?

208
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,792
I need no reminder, Cassius,
of what she has done.

209
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,085
Shame on you, sir.

210
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,130
I will not hear her name spoken again.

211
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:24,424
Cassius, I share your outrage.

212
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,344
Whatever has possessed you?

213
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,054
If we don't act decisively...

214
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,220
the war will be at your gate
within a fortnight.

215
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:34,142
And that is precisely where it will remain.

216
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:37,479
No Lycan pack would dare
to attack our coven.

217
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,773
Our defenses would rip them apart.

218
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,192
An ordinary Lycan pack, perhaps...

219
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:45,528
but Marius has gathered a force
far more powerful than any...

220
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:46,988
Unsubstantiated hyperbole.

221
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,990
You need Selene.

222
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:53,787
Her prowess, her leadership,
her intimate knowledge of Lycans.

223
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,498
And her combat skills
are second to none.

224
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,167
He's right, she is the most
lethal Death Dealer we've ever had.

225
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:02,879
But she killed one of her own.

226
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:07,092
Not only the most powerful
and respected of the Elders...

227
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:11,680
her protector, who loved her
like his own daughter.

228
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:13,723
She cannot be trusted.

229
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,141
She has been judged.

230
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,894
Perhaps she can also be redeemed.

231
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:20,563
It pains me to say it,
but Thomas is right.

232
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,692
No warrior has proved herself
more in battle.

233
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:27,112
She would be invaluable
in our fight against Marius...

234
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,324
perhaps even the pivotal element
to secure our victory.

235
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,870
If she can be found...

236
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:40,542
and sets foot
within this precious coven...

237
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:43,878
I will hold you, Semira,
personally responsible...

238
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,797
- for controlling her.
- Of course.

239
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:14,451
<i>Intruder. Intruder. Intruder.</i>

240
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,494
<i>Intruder. Intruder.</i>

241
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,510
Who sent you?

242
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:35,597
Drop it.

243
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,395
How'd you find us?

244
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,814
There are only a handful
of safe houses left.

245
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,901
The Lycans made it rather easy.

246
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:50,487
The council of the Eastern Coven
sent me to bring you in.

247
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,364
- For trial?
- No.

248
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:56,493
- For your safety, and ours.
- You cannot expect me to believe that.

249
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,912
Every single one of them
signed my death warrant.

250
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,206
- Times change.
- Vampires do not.

251
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:02,916
This is from your father.

252
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,337
Is it authentic?

253
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:09,547
It's his seal, his handwriting.

254
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:12,926
The council has offered you clemency
and granted us both safe haven.

255
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,886
- Why?
- Marius.

256
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:17,430
It is the council's humble request...

257
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:20,266
that you train us
to defeat him and his army.

258
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,103
Move. Come on.

259
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,938
The signal's coming from this way.

260
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,982
Look, I understand you're reluctant...

261
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:30,985
but as guests of the council,
we will be protected by law.

262
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,321
My father wouldn't lie,
and he holds no grudge.

263
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:36,449
- He had no love for Viktor, either.
<i>- Intruder. Intruder.</i>

264
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,743
- Lycans.
<i>- Intruder.</i>

265
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:43,915
- We must leave.
- You should accept the council's offer.

266
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:46,001
- For Eve.
- Eve does not want my help.

267
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,503
I know you want to protect her.
And if we destroy Marius...

268
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,839
we destroy the greatest threat
to her safety.

269
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:52,298
Now.

270
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:10,442
Marius.

271
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,155
We just missed them.

272
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,867
I do not wish to hear
the word "just" again.

273
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,619
Either we have her or we have nothing.

274
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:24,831
Do you understand?

275
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,083
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

276
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,603
<i>Tango Charlie approaching.</i>

277
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,146
<i>All clear.</i>

278
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,316
<i>Perimeter secure.</i>

279
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,831
- Welcome.
- Am I?

280
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:09,542
Our coven's resources
and weaponry are yours...

281
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:13,296
to transform these raw recruits
into Death Dealers worthy of your name.

282
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:15,590
Varga will be your right-hand man.

283
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:17,467
He knows all our strengths
and weaknesses.

284
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:21,221
He is also our most prolific Lycan killer
with over 40 confirmed kills.

285
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:23,306
- It's an honor.
- David, welcome.

286
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:26,184
- Thank you.
- To mark the safe arrival of our guests...

287
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:28,520
I've arranged a little soiree
in the Winter Garden.

288
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,522
There's really no need. Thank you.

289
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:33,441
Nonsense. There's always a need
to indulge in pleasure.

290
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:58,675
In times of war...

291
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:01,678
this coven needs moments to celebrate.

292
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:05,807
The arrival of Thomas,
David and Selene...

293
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:08,935
is reason aplenty to rejoice.

294
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:12,272
To us all.

295
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:27,537
It's good of you to offer us
sanctuary, Semira. Thank you.

296
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:30,165
It will be entirely my pleasure.

297
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:34,085
Tell me, is it true that her blood
brought you back to life?

298
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:35,628
Yes, it is.

299
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,547
I owe her everything.

300
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:42,135
But, if you'll excuse me,
my father requests my counsel.

301
00:21:44,512 --> 00:21:46,139
Thomas was always such a bore.

302
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:53,271
Well, Semira's certainly taken
an interest in you.

303
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:56,191
Well, the interest is certainly not mutual.

304
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:58,651
We need her protection.

305
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,446
On the contrary,
I think I need protection from her.

306
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:03,281
The Battle of the Peste.

307
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,368
We thought it would be
the one to end the war...

308
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:07,911
the final conflict...

309
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:09,913
but here we are still.

310
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,750
I hope you see my bid for clemency
for Selene for what it is.

311
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:15,797
Well, clemency
is the least you can offer her...

312
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,355
after bartering her daughter
to the Lycans.

313
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:21,007
I lost so much during this war.

314
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:24,511
Believe me, I am haunted still
by all those I failed.

315
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:27,222
Well, then you must help me protect her.

316
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,391
She has lost even more
than we can imagine.

317
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,601
And she's important to me.

318
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,198
Marius is out there...

319
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:49,536
reeking of canine insolence,
plotting our downfall.

320
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:56,209
We do not need Selene to destroy him.

321
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:58,753
I am more than capable.

322
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,423
No, Varga, you are merely adequate.

323
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:05,135
It's fortunate that we're not forced
to rely on your skills for our survival.

324
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:08,638
That, my sweet...

325
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,224
yet unimaginative bedfellow...

326
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:12,767
is my area of expertise.

327
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:14,694
- I think you should...
- Don't think, Varga.

328
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:16,604
You'll hurt yourself.

329
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:21,401
There are other ways
to prove your devotion.

330
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:37,125
Piece by delicate piece...

331
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:43,006
the puzzle will fall into place.

332
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:46,968
Oh, yeah...

333
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:49,929
Yeah...

334
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:30,136
Don't aim where the Lycan is. Anticipate.

335
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:37,519
And remember...

336
00:24:37,686 --> 00:24:40,164
a Lycan is never more vulnerable
than when he's in wolf form.

337
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:41,773
- What?
- That makes no sense.

338
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:45,168
In wolf form,
they cannot use weapons...

339
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:47,654
and their thinking
becomes much more primitive...

340
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:49,030
driven only by bloodlust.

341
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:51,950
- How many have you killed?
- I don't keep track.

342
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:55,245
I'm increasing Lycan speed
by 20 percent.

343
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,416
Please continue.

344
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:07,424
My pack has probed the Eastern Coven's
perimeter for weaknesses...

345
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,591
and there are none.

346
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:10,798
And any direct assault
would trigger the lockdown...

347
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,407
which makes the coven impregnable.

348
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,270
Even if we could break inside
without losing 90 percent of our force...

349
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:17,034
- they have fallback positions...
- This.

350
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:19,811
- That can be...
- Is this ready?

351
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:21,646
Yeah.

352
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:24,274
When we have the hybrid's blood...

353
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:26,192
we launch against the Eastern.

354
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,653
Find Selene, and we find her daughter.

355
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:35,452
My own invention.

356
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:37,430
One of the first things
a Death Dealer must learn...

357
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:38,973
is how to fight in a confined space.

358
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:42,500
Of course, the one thing this
training session lacks is unpredictability.

359
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:46,254
Perhaps you'll indulge me
and give my students...

360
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:50,717
I should say your students.
A lesson in combat's unpredictability.

361
00:25:50,884 --> 00:25:54,763
It would not only honor us, but it
would be invaluable to their training.

362
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:56,765
- I don't...
- Please.

363
00:25:58,516 --> 00:26:00,018
That's enough.

364
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:04,230
Gather round.
We are going to school you...

365
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:07,442
in the true nature of the Lycan warrior.

366
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:11,654
For the sake of this lesson,
our esteemed guest Selene...

367
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:15,200
will play the role of Death Dealer
bravely defending our fortress...

368
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:18,953
and I will take the role
of Lycan villain...

369
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,663
here to destroy it.

370
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,332
Ladies first.

371
00:26:45,188 --> 00:26:46,272
Impressive.

372
00:26:54,197 --> 00:26:55,573
Come on.

373
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,786
Come on.

374
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:41,369
Tonight's lesson:

375
00:27:41,536 --> 00:27:44,914
Do not trust your opponent
to fight with honor.

376
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:47,125
They are Lycan. They have none.

377
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:52,672
Don't move.

378
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:02,807
Nightshade.

379
00:28:02,974 --> 00:28:05,393
Leeches into vampire cells, usually fatal.

380
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,813
But for one with her strength,
there will only be pain...

381
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,190
followed by paralysis.

382
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:11,900
I'll kill you.

383
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:15,236
UV bullets.

384
00:28:21,076 --> 00:28:24,371
Did you honestly think
I would forgive you for killing Viktor?

385
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:26,414
Varga, you have orders.

386
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,210
Varga!

387
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,992
I don't need you to train Death Dealers.

388
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:05,078
I have Varga for that.

389
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:07,914
All that I need to rule this coven...

390
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:12,836
and end the march of the Lycans
is your blood.

391
00:29:20,051 --> 00:29:21,344
What about the bodies?

392
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:25,181
Sound the alarm.

393
00:29:25,724 --> 00:29:27,976
Have the council find them.

394
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:33,398
Conclusive evidence of the atrocity
committed by Selene.

395
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:44,034
There's been a breach.

396
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:45,785
We need to find Selene.

397
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:49,414
- Cordoned off. Semira's orders.
- Step aside.

398
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:54,127
David.

399
00:29:55,378 --> 00:29:56,546
Come.

400
00:29:57,005 --> 00:30:00,258
There's more than one way
to move around this coven.

401
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:03,303
Amelia created these passageways
centuries ago.

402
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,433
Where does this lead?

403
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,228
To the private chambers,
including Semira's.

404
00:30:38,088 --> 00:30:39,756
What the hell have they done to her?

405
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:43,051
<i>Machina sanguinem exhauri.</i>

406
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:45,720
Bloodletting.

407
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:52,352
Semira wants Selene's
most precious asset.

408
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:55,438
- This is going to kill her.
- Eventually, yes...

409
00:30:55,605 --> 00:30:58,274
but it will be agonizingly slow.

410
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:04,781
Look.

411
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:08,451
This is designed to open the arteries
as wide as possible.

412
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:11,913
If we're not very careful,
we will do her more harm than good.

413
00:31:12,455 --> 00:31:13,748
Careful.

414
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:34,144
Is this hers?

415
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,311
Yes.

416
00:31:35,478 --> 00:31:38,064
Selene uses only this
particular weapon.

417
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:41,818
A known traitor within our walls.

418
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:43,611
This is precisely what I foresaw...

419
00:31:43,778 --> 00:31:47,073
and what you assured me
you would prevent.

420
00:31:47,365 --> 00:31:49,159
Their blood is upon your hands.

421
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:51,369
- Sir, I did everything...
- Do not speak to me.

422
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:52,746
There can be no mercy.

423
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:55,498
I want her hunted
to the ends of the Earth.

424
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:57,542
It shall be done.

425
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:00,962
And I want her captured alive.

426
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:05,842
Is that understood?

427
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:07,927
Perfectly.

428
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,647
- We're running out of time.
- All right, take her.

429
00:32:19,814 --> 00:32:21,775
You must go north, far north.

430
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:23,443
Var Dohr.

431
00:32:25,403 --> 00:32:26,613
No.

432
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,740
Father and son united in treason.

433
00:32:28,907 --> 00:32:30,617
Carry on with Selene.

434
00:32:31,743 --> 00:32:32,744
I'll deal with them.

435
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,171
Come on.

436
00:32:54,557 --> 00:32:55,850
Go! Now!

437
00:32:56,643 --> 00:32:58,144
No!

438
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:10,407
<i>Dawn alert. 60 seconds to sunrise.</i>

439
00:33:10,573 --> 00:33:13,284
Go ahead. The sun will burn you
to ashes out there...

440
00:33:13,451 --> 00:33:15,453
or you can die
with some grace in here.

441
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:46,568
They can walk in the sun.

442
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:07,547
You need to feed.
You've lost too much blood.

443
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:28,401
That child... Because he
helped that child of yours.

444
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:30,987
My son is dead. Dead.

445
00:34:31,196 --> 00:34:32,238
David.

446
00:34:33,365 --> 00:34:34,366
Take her now.

447
00:34:34,532 --> 00:34:36,159
You must go north. Var Dohr.

448
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,538
Go! Now!

449
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:54,844
Thank you.

450
00:34:58,556 --> 00:35:02,435
I'm very sorry
that you lost your father.

451
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:05,397
He put up a valiant fight.

452
00:35:05,897 --> 00:35:09,150
It's strange to lose someone
you feel like you never really knew.

453
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:13,238
I feel the same about my mother, but...

454
00:35:14,447 --> 00:35:16,491
I have almost no memory of her.

455
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:19,244
And I of Eve.

456
00:35:20,537 --> 00:35:22,330
I didn't want her.

457
00:35:22,831 --> 00:35:24,332
I didn't know her.

458
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,251
And now I've lost her.

459
00:35:26,418 --> 00:35:28,670
Why do you insist on saying
that you've lost her?

460
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:32,757
She made me promise
I would never look for her...

461
00:35:32,924 --> 00:35:35,635
that I would never consider myself
having a daughter.

462
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:37,637
And she was right.

463
00:35:39,514 --> 00:35:41,975
Nothing good has come
to anyone I love.

464
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:45,895
You're family,
and you're all I have left.

465
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,316
Well, then, you really are in trouble.

466
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:54,237
You need to rest.

467
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:05,248
Selene's clearly in league
with the Lycans.

468
00:36:05,707 --> 00:36:08,501
Thomas and David were complicit
in this treachery.

469
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:12,088
They walked in the sun. This alone
is evidence of Lycan collusion.

470
00:36:12,255 --> 00:36:15,216
Selene must be wiped from the pages
of our proud history.

471
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:16,426
Alexia.

472
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:19,512
- We shall avenge our fallen.
- See to it that you do.

473
00:36:45,663 --> 00:36:49,751
- How much nightshade did you use?
- I thought it best to err on the side...

474
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:52,337
Varga, what have we said
about you thinking?

475
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:54,506
The poison will dissipate.

476
00:36:54,673 --> 00:36:57,967
I need this blood untainted,
and I need it now.

477
00:36:58,134 --> 00:37:00,261
It cannot be rushed.

478
00:37:00,804 --> 00:37:02,138
It must run its course.

479
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:08,269
It's definitely the car.

480
00:37:08,436 --> 00:37:11,856
But no sign of where they went.

481
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:14,067
Spread out across the city.

482
00:37:14,234 --> 00:37:15,819
Search everywhere.

483
00:37:23,118 --> 00:37:26,496
<i>The train at platform four
terminates at this station.</i>

484
00:37:43,346 --> 00:37:44,889
Northbound.

485
00:37:59,362 --> 00:38:02,198
I will be more powerful...

486
00:38:03,408 --> 00:38:05,368
than Cassius...

487
00:38:07,662 --> 00:38:09,706
than any vampire in this coven.

488
00:38:17,797 --> 00:38:20,317
- What news of the search?
- Selene and David are heading north.

489
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:22,761
- Of course they are.
- Your Grace?

490
00:38:22,927 --> 00:38:24,929
They will run to the only
remaining coven...

491
00:38:25,096 --> 00:38:28,308
to afford them safe haven:
Var Dohr, the Nordic fortress.

492
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:30,226
But Var Dohr is only a legend.

493
00:38:30,393 --> 00:38:32,937
I would not give it
such an elevated status.

494
00:38:33,104 --> 00:38:37,525
It is a frigid, dreary outpost
full of pathetic, peace-loving cowards.

495
00:38:37,692 --> 00:38:40,070
You speak of it
as if you have actually been there.

496
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:44,532
Where do you think I was
when Viktor wasted years with Selene?

497
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:47,410
Prepare yourself.

498
00:38:47,577 --> 00:38:50,372
The journey's long,
and I need you to take it alone.

499
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:53,667
I must be certain the traitor's there...

500
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:57,754
before I risk sending a full squad
of Death Dealers so far from this coven.

501
00:39:30,036 --> 00:39:31,621
You need to be more careful.

502
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,923
You need to be more gentle.

503
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:48,138
- Have you found Selene?
- Yes.

504
00:39:48,304 --> 00:39:50,348
She is headed for the Nordic Coven.

505
00:39:52,851 --> 00:39:55,478
I risk everything for this.

506
00:39:55,645 --> 00:39:59,607
- For you, for us.
- I know, my love.

507
00:39:59,774 --> 00:40:03,069
Semira grows more insane
for power with each day.

508
00:40:03,236 --> 00:40:04,863
She must be stopped.

509
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:08,033
And every day, I fear more
what she will do if we are discovered.

510
00:40:09,534 --> 00:40:13,663
I cannot attack the Eastern Coven
without the blood of the hybrid.

511
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:16,708
It's too strong, even for my horde.

512
00:40:17,834 --> 00:40:19,461
Selene...

513
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:24,341
She is the key to the futures
of Lycans and vampires alike.

514
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:26,760
You shall have her.

515
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,331
Var Dohr is just beyond that ridge.

516
00:42:57,285 --> 00:42:59,162
Where is everyone?

517
00:42:59,954 --> 00:43:01,623
Watching.

518
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:11,633
We come seeking sanctuary...

519
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,426
not to fight.

520
00:43:14,844 --> 00:43:16,888
Then you've come to the right place.

521
00:43:21,935 --> 00:43:23,728
My name is Lena.

522
00:43:23,895 --> 00:43:25,730
Follow me.

523
00:43:26,981 --> 00:43:28,650
What was that?

524
00:43:28,817 --> 00:43:30,735
Some kind of trick.

525
00:43:57,887 --> 00:43:59,389
You must be Selene.

526
00:43:59,973 --> 00:44:02,392
Does the great Death Dealer
truly come in peace?

527
00:44:03,018 --> 00:44:05,020
- I do.
- And what about this one?

528
00:44:05,186 --> 00:44:07,397
This is David, son of Thomas.

529
00:44:07,564 --> 00:44:11,067
Who I haven't seen
for many, many years.

530
00:44:13,945 --> 00:44:15,780
You must excuse the attention.

531
00:44:15,947 --> 00:44:19,325
Our coven doesn't receive
many guests, by design.

532
00:44:19,492 --> 00:44:20,493
We do as we wish...

533
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:23,246
- not as others would have us do.
- And what of the Lycans?

534
00:44:23,413 --> 00:44:25,749
We are too far removed
for them to take notice...

535
00:44:25,915 --> 00:44:30,128
and even if they did, our climate
is quite an obstacle to warm-bloods.

536
00:44:30,587 --> 00:44:32,630
This coven wouldn't exist...

537
00:44:32,797 --> 00:44:35,383
- without your mother's grace.
- You knew my mother?

538
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:37,177
All vampires do, my boy.

539
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:39,679
No. My mother was low-born.
She died giving birth to me.

540
00:44:39,846 --> 00:44:43,183
A falsehood, you will find,
designed to keep your true lineage safe.

541
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:44,809
- Is she still alive?
- No.

542
00:44:45,352 --> 00:44:48,313
And her death
was a terrible blow to our kind.

543
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,149
The mourning ceremony we held
lasted for an entire month.

544
00:44:51,316 --> 00:44:54,027
Such an honor
is usually reserved for a high-born...

545
00:44:54,194 --> 00:44:55,820
- a Grand Elder.
- Yes.

546
00:44:58,281 --> 00:45:00,033
- Amelia.
- Yes.

547
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,702
How could a Grand Elder
have been my mother...

548
00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:04,079
and I not been told?

549
00:45:04,746 --> 00:45:06,581
I have something for you.

550
00:45:22,305 --> 00:45:25,892
Your father's greatest work,
infused with silver.

551
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:28,645
The Lycans will cower
from the very sight of it.

552
00:45:28,812 --> 00:45:31,356
- It's beautiful.
- Thomas knew that one day...

553
00:45:31,523 --> 00:45:33,775
you would be beset
by enemies on both sides...

554
00:45:33,942 --> 00:45:34,984
and he was right.

555
00:45:35,151 --> 00:45:38,530
David, this means that you are
the rightful heir of the Eastern Coven.

556
00:45:38,697 --> 00:45:41,491
Your mother and father
spent many months...

557
00:45:41,658 --> 00:45:43,785
within the safety of these walls.

558
00:45:44,411 --> 00:45:45,787
Viktor grew suspicious.

559
00:45:45,954 --> 00:45:48,081
Then your father spirited you away...

560
00:45:48,248 --> 00:45:51,751
before Semira arrived with her troops.

561
00:45:53,211 --> 00:45:56,131
- And what of my mother?
- She returned to the Eastern Coven.

562
00:45:56,297 --> 00:45:57,465
The light in her eyes...

563
00:45:57,632 --> 00:46:00,510
Don't try and fabricate
some kind of martyrdom for her.

564
00:46:00,677 --> 00:46:02,446
I prefer a more honest
appraisal of her decision.

565
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:05,932
She abandoned her only son
for the sake of her precious council.

566
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:08,476
- Take it.
- David.

567
00:46:08,643 --> 00:46:10,228
David.

568
00:46:12,689 --> 00:46:14,941
Amelia asked me to give him this.

569
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:34,919
What do you need?

570
00:46:35,086 --> 00:46:36,880
Nothing. I just need to be left alone.

571
00:46:37,922 --> 00:46:39,591
Yes, I know the feeling.

572
00:46:40,342 --> 00:46:42,177
Why didn't my father
tell me about my mother?

573
00:46:42,635 --> 00:46:44,220
I did not know your father well...

574
00:46:44,387 --> 00:46:46,848
but I know that his greatest fear
was to lose you.

575
00:46:47,015 --> 00:46:50,727
It seems it's the curse of every parent
to disappoint their child.

576
00:46:50,894 --> 00:46:54,189
- At least you fought for your child, Selene.
- Yes, and lost.

577
00:46:55,023 --> 00:46:57,859
You have pure-blood heritage, David.
Your mother was an Elder.

578
00:46:58,193 --> 00:47:00,487
Your parents kept you safe
for a reason.

579
00:47:00,653 --> 00:47:03,448
They protected you
so that one day you could lead.

580
00:47:05,617 --> 00:47:06,910
Your mother left you a gift.

581
00:47:10,455 --> 00:47:12,767
Oh, that's very kind of you,
but I have no use for jewelry.

582
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:15,001
The ring is not the gift.

583
00:47:15,335 --> 00:47:17,879
It contains the gift: A mother's love.

584
00:47:19,089 --> 00:47:21,049
A single drop of her blood.

585
00:47:21,508 --> 00:47:23,385
Maybe it'll help you decide.

586
00:47:59,462 --> 00:48:01,172
You're just in time.

587
00:48:01,673 --> 00:48:04,467
- Come.
- What is this?

588
00:48:04,634 --> 00:48:07,804
- Valissa, the in-between place.
- Is she dead?

589
00:48:07,971 --> 00:48:09,889
No.

590
00:48:10,974 --> 00:48:12,559
She is...

591
00:48:13,476 --> 00:48:14,477
becoming.

592
00:48:14,686 --> 00:48:15,979
She took a poison.

593
00:48:16,146 --> 00:48:18,148
It allows her to visit the Sacred World.

594
00:48:18,565 --> 00:48:21,818
When she returns,
she will see this world with new eyes.

595
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:23,820
I don't understand what this is.

596
00:48:23,987 --> 00:48:27,157
We have long known
there is more than just this world.

597
00:48:27,824 --> 00:48:30,035
When my father
first brought me down here...

598
00:48:30,201 --> 00:48:31,661
I felt as you do now...

599
00:48:31,828 --> 00:48:35,832
but I have since been
to the Sacred World many times.

600
00:48:37,083 --> 00:48:39,919
My eyes see beyond the surface
of so many things.

601
00:48:41,046 --> 00:48:43,590
- I see much about you.
- Such as?

602
00:48:43,757 --> 00:48:46,384
I can see you've loved a Lycan...

603
00:48:46,551 --> 00:48:49,679
- killed a vampire Elder, and given birth...
- Stop.

604
00:48:52,974 --> 00:48:56,394
I see you have lost your daughter...

605
00:48:56,561 --> 00:48:59,022
and how much pain
this gives you deep inside...

606
00:48:59,189 --> 00:49:01,149
where you will always hide it.

607
00:49:04,861 --> 00:49:06,237
She's a special child.

608
00:49:06,404 --> 00:49:08,698
Many battles will be fought...

609
00:49:09,491 --> 00:49:11,534
and lost over her.

610
00:49:11,701 --> 00:49:13,787
- What else do you see?
- Darkness.

611
00:49:13,953 --> 00:49:15,705
One that touches us all.

612
00:49:16,122 --> 00:49:20,126
If you want to keep her safe,
you will need to go further...

613
00:49:20,293 --> 00:49:24,255
than even a warrior of your renown
has ever ventured before.

614
00:49:24,422 --> 00:49:27,175
I have seen so much war...

615
00:49:27,342 --> 00:49:29,427
so much killing.

616
00:49:29,594 --> 00:49:30,762
I cannot bear more.

617
00:49:30,929 --> 00:49:33,306
The peace you will feel here is real.

618
00:49:33,473 --> 00:49:36,935
It seeps into your skin
and comforts your soul.

619
00:49:37,102 --> 00:49:39,104
Tell me about the Sacred World.

620
00:49:39,771 --> 00:49:42,023
The water is the path.

621
00:49:59,457 --> 00:50:00,458
<i>Amelia!</i>

622
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,846
<i>I name our son David.</i>

623
00:50:13,013 --> 00:50:14,347
<i>David.</i>

624
00:50:15,306 --> 00:50:17,559
<i>One day, you will understand.</i>

625
00:50:17,726 --> 00:50:20,228
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

626
00:50:38,496 --> 00:50:39,956
Lycans! Sound the alarm!

627
00:50:40,123 --> 00:50:41,207
Close the doors!

628
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:43,293
Move!

629
00:50:49,924 --> 00:50:53,511
Just as I spoke of peace,
war has followed you here.

630
00:50:53,678 --> 00:50:54,888
Protect your own.

631
00:50:55,055 --> 00:50:56,765
I must find David.

632
00:51:04,981 --> 00:51:07,901
- We have to get you away.
- No. We led the Lycans here.

633
00:51:08,068 --> 00:51:10,403
We can't let these people die.

634
00:52:10,547 --> 00:52:12,340
Run!

635
00:52:20,015 --> 00:52:21,099
This way, men.

636
00:52:23,852 --> 00:52:25,979
Go around that side.

637
00:53:01,389 --> 00:53:02,599
There she is.

638
00:53:23,953 --> 00:53:25,497
You parasite.

639
00:53:25,663 --> 00:53:26,873
Just do it.

640
00:54:25,348 --> 00:54:26,349
Marius.

641
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:28,643
At last.

642
00:54:53,918 --> 00:54:55,086
On your right!

643
00:55:28,578 --> 00:55:30,080
I expected more from you.

644
00:55:48,682 --> 00:55:50,141
Tell me where your daughter is.

645
00:55:51,476 --> 00:55:53,520
I don't know.

646
00:55:53,937 --> 00:55:57,148
Selene, all I want is her blood.

647
00:56:08,785 --> 00:56:11,329
Only she can end this war.

648
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:15,959
I give you my word
she will not be killed.

649
00:56:43,945 --> 00:56:44,946
What are you?

650
00:58:06,945 --> 00:58:08,113
Tell him where she is...

651
00:58:08,279 --> 00:58:10,532
and all this butchery
will be over forever.

652
00:58:10,699 --> 00:58:12,742
I don't know.

653
00:58:12,909 --> 00:58:14,536
Lies.

654
00:58:21,835 --> 00:58:22,836
They've gone.

655
00:58:23,837 --> 00:58:25,380
<i>Michael.</i>

656
00:58:26,256 --> 00:58:29,217
- I freed you.
<i>- Look at the eyes.</i>

657
00:58:29,926 --> 00:58:31,594
<i>Who I am?
Do you not know who I am?</i>

658
00:58:31,761 --> 00:58:33,680
<i>- My daughter.
- I don't want you.</i>

659
00:58:33,847 --> 00:58:35,598
<i>Don't look for me.</i>

660
00:58:36,808 --> 00:58:38,560
She's telling the truth.

661
00:58:40,812 --> 00:58:41,980
She doesn't know.

662
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,659
My time is done.

663
00:59:08,214 --> 00:59:10,425
They are retreating.

664
00:59:16,264 --> 00:59:18,141
I'm running out of time.

665
00:59:18,308 --> 00:59:20,643
We must strike against
the Eastern Coven now.

666
00:59:22,312 --> 00:59:23,938
You know what you must do.

667
00:59:34,866 --> 00:59:37,160
Water is the path.

668
01:00:09,442 --> 01:00:10,819
Selene.

669
01:00:24,791 --> 01:00:26,376
<i>Praise the day...</i>

670
01:00:27,836 --> 01:00:29,587
<i>when it ends.</i>

671
01:00:29,796 --> 01:00:32,298
<i>Praise the ice...</i>

672
01:00:32,465 --> 01:00:34,092
<i>when it holds.</i>

673
01:00:34,884 --> 01:00:36,094
<i>Praise the sword...</i>

674
01:00:36,678 --> 01:00:38,722
<i>when it kills.</i>

675
01:00:40,098 --> 01:00:41,683
<i>Praise the life...</i>

676
01:00:42,726 --> 01:00:44,561
<i>that has lived.</i>

677
01:00:54,112 --> 01:00:55,947
It's time.

678
01:00:59,617 --> 01:01:00,994
Power.

679
01:01:01,161 --> 01:01:03,663
Such a seductively simple thing.

680
01:01:04,122 --> 01:01:07,292
Either you have it all
or you have nothing.

681
01:01:44,621 --> 01:01:46,748
How fascinating.

682
01:01:50,335 --> 01:01:52,587
<i>Amelia...</i>

683
01:01:53,171 --> 01:01:56,716
<i>The water is the path.</i>

684
01:02:08,144 --> 01:02:10,105
You should stay here, David.

685
01:02:10,271 --> 01:02:12,482
This can be your home.

686
01:02:12,649 --> 01:02:14,067
Marius is heading east.

687
01:02:14,234 --> 01:02:15,777
There's nothing stopping him now.

688
01:02:16,403 --> 01:02:19,364
And my people are beset
with enemies on all sides.

689
01:02:19,614 --> 01:02:21,616
How can I stay here and live...

690
01:02:22,325 --> 01:02:25,328
- while they die?
- They need a leader.

691
01:02:40,301 --> 01:02:42,470
<i>Gate secure. Perimeter check.</i>

692
01:02:44,431 --> 01:02:45,932
Miss me?

693
01:02:46,099 --> 01:02:48,435
<i>- East gate is clear.
- West gate clear.</i>

694
01:02:49,394 --> 01:02:51,396
<i>Commencing perimeter sweep.</i>

695
01:02:54,232 --> 01:02:55,567
<i>Access granted.</i>

696
01:03:01,614 --> 01:03:03,199
What news do you bring?

697
01:03:03,366 --> 01:03:04,743
A massacre.

698
01:03:05,702 --> 01:03:08,288
The Lycans attacked
the fortress of Var Dohr.

699
01:03:08,455 --> 01:03:09,914
Lycans in the north.

700
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:15,337
The Nordic Coven
was taken completely by surprise.

701
01:03:15,545 --> 01:03:19,257
- Dozens of vampires have been killed.
- Was Selene amongst them?

702
01:03:19,424 --> 01:03:22,802
Dead. Killed by Marius himself.

703
01:03:22,969 --> 01:03:25,388
Wherever Selene goes,
trouble surely follows.

704
01:03:25,555 --> 01:03:27,932
- What of David?
- I do not know.

705
01:03:28,099 --> 01:03:31,353
I only wished I had arrived sooner.
I might have helped in some way.

706
01:03:31,519 --> 01:03:34,189
Well, you've helped in so many ways.

707
01:03:34,356 --> 01:03:38,610
You've done exactly as I hoped
and planned, if not more.

708
01:03:39,819 --> 01:03:43,907
You see, information is power.

709
01:03:48,411 --> 01:03:52,040
And I collect it with a passion.

710
01:04:01,341 --> 01:04:04,344
Thank you for leading Marius
to the Nordic Coven.

711
01:04:04,511 --> 01:04:07,097
Your Lycan lover...

712
01:04:07,764 --> 01:04:10,892
must be delighted
with his momentary success.

713
01:04:12,268 --> 01:04:14,270
You thought I didn't know.

714
01:04:17,107 --> 01:04:19,192
Foolish girl.

715
01:04:27,742 --> 01:04:30,578
<i>Dawn alert.
60 seconds to sunrise.</i>

716
01:04:34,874 --> 01:04:38,837
The Lycan scourge
destroyed an entire coven.

717
01:04:39,004 --> 01:04:41,131
To hide behind these walls
increases their advantage.

718
01:04:41,297 --> 01:04:43,174
We cannot take the war to Marius.

719
01:04:43,341 --> 01:04:45,510
Should we cower in the safety
of these walls...

720
01:04:45,677 --> 01:04:49,264
- while he picks us off one by one?
- Curb your insidious comments, Semira.

721
01:04:49,431 --> 01:04:51,975
This coven has held for 15 centuries.

722
01:04:52,142 --> 01:04:55,812
- It will hold for 15 more.
- I hoped you would show strength...

723
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:59,566
though I was willing
to settle for competence.

724
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:03,528
I was wrong.

725
01:05:07,323 --> 01:05:09,284
What is the meaning of this?

726
01:05:09,451 --> 01:05:12,162
If this council is too weak
to take action...

727
01:05:12,328 --> 01:05:13,955
it is my duty to do so.

728
01:05:14,122 --> 01:05:19,002
You are relieved of your duties
as council members effective immediately.

729
01:05:22,422 --> 01:05:24,466
The traitor returns.

730
01:05:26,384 --> 01:05:29,012
Oh, you are a fool
to show your face here.

731
01:05:29,763 --> 01:05:31,806
I will make you pay
for what you've done, Semira.

732
01:05:32,307 --> 01:05:34,387
Marius and his army
are heading this way as we speak.

733
01:05:35,226 --> 01:05:37,812
- I come to save my people.
- Your people?

734
01:05:37,979 --> 01:05:39,981
Kill him. Kill him.

735
01:05:40,148 --> 01:05:42,567
You aspire to be the protector
of your bloodline...

736
01:05:42,734 --> 01:05:45,195
yet you kill your own kind
in pursuit of power.

737
01:05:45,362 --> 01:05:46,404
It ends now.

738
01:05:47,322 --> 01:05:50,658
I am David,
son of the great Elder Amelia.

739
01:05:51,534 --> 01:05:54,079
And I am the rightful heir to this coven.

740
01:05:55,413 --> 01:05:57,540
Amelia had no son.

741
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,877
Well, she had the foresight...

742
01:06:01,044 --> 01:06:03,380
to know that my claim
would be challenged.

743
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:06,049
For the council.

744
01:06:22,273 --> 01:06:23,650
Amelia.

745
01:06:37,706 --> 01:06:39,457
His claim is true.

746
01:06:40,583 --> 01:06:43,878
David is the last of the purebloods.

747
01:06:45,630 --> 01:06:48,383
Irrelevant.
You are outnumbered and outgunned.

748
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:50,719
Varga, your orders still remain.
Kill him.

749
01:06:54,973 --> 01:06:57,851
- I said, "Kill him."
- No.

750
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:03,314
You swore to serve me.

751
01:07:03,481 --> 01:07:05,650
I swore to protect
the leader of this house.

752
01:07:06,276 --> 01:07:07,444
<i>Breach detected.</i>

753
01:07:08,111 --> 01:07:10,280
<i>- Security system engaged.</i>
- Lycans. They're here.

754
01:07:10,447 --> 01:07:13,199
Lock her away until she can be judged
by the council.

755
01:07:13,783 --> 01:07:16,953
<i>Security system engaged.
Breach detected. Security system...</i>

756
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:22,334
- She gets her damn war after all.
- Varga, you can still be forgiven.

757
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:23,710
Gag her as well.

758
01:07:52,197 --> 01:07:53,948
Come on, move that truck. Move it.

759
01:08:00,872 --> 01:08:02,415
Watch your angles!

760
01:08:04,334 --> 01:08:05,335
Let's go!

761
01:08:29,192 --> 01:08:30,318
Hold your positions.

762
01:09:12,068 --> 01:09:14,738
- On the staircase!
- Behind you!

763
01:09:19,159 --> 01:09:21,703
- Fall back!
- Retreat!

764
01:09:36,259 --> 01:09:37,302
Behind the balustrades!

765
01:09:37,802 --> 01:09:39,346
Take them out!

766
01:09:52,150 --> 01:09:54,527
- Come on!
- Move, move, move!

767
01:09:56,363 --> 01:09:57,405
Move it!

768
01:10:05,705 --> 01:10:07,332
Fuck.

769
01:10:08,958 --> 01:10:10,877
Aim at the ready!

770
01:10:13,004 --> 01:10:14,506
Fire!

771
01:10:41,574 --> 01:10:42,992
Fire!

772
01:10:59,009 --> 01:11:01,094
Hide from the light!

773
01:11:06,266 --> 01:11:08,143
Run!

774
01:11:08,309 --> 01:11:09,644
Move!

775
01:11:12,355 --> 01:11:13,356
Shoot, shoot, shoot!

776
01:12:42,987 --> 01:12:44,572
Impossible.

777
01:12:44,739 --> 01:12:45,740
I saw you dead.

778
01:12:46,366 --> 01:12:47,367
I'm here.

779
01:12:47,534 --> 01:12:49,077
I brought backup.

780
01:12:57,377 --> 01:12:58,461
There are too many of them.

781
01:14:21,586 --> 01:14:22,754
I've already killed you.

782
01:14:31,179 --> 01:14:32,347
Marius!

783
01:16:18,703 --> 01:16:20,205
- Marius.
<i>- Please.</i>

784
01:17:04,332 --> 01:17:06,334
I wish your father
was alive to see this.

785
01:17:08,128 --> 01:17:10,296
His ridiculous dream
of you ruling this coven...

786
01:17:10,463 --> 01:17:12,298
will be the very thing that kills you.

787
01:17:17,971 --> 01:17:19,472
Missed.

788
01:17:28,064 --> 01:17:30,817
Oh, it worked.

789
01:18:00,138 --> 01:18:01,222
I'm one of you.

790
01:18:01,639 --> 01:18:03,558
No! No! No!

791
01:18:17,155 --> 01:18:18,740
You killed Michael.

792
01:18:22,702 --> 01:18:24,037
This is the last of him.

793
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:12,502
<i>You're family,
and you're all I have left.</i>

794
01:19:12,669 --> 01:19:13,837
<i>Do you not know who I am?</i>

795
01:20:26,826 --> 01:20:28,119
Your leader is dead.

796
01:20:32,207 --> 01:20:34,167
Take your wounded. Leave.

797
01:20:35,794 --> 01:20:37,295
Leave!

798
01:20:44,177 --> 01:20:47,263
<i>We fought our greatest battle
in our darkest hour.</i>

799
01:20:48,264 --> 01:20:51,810
<i>After centuries of war
between vampire and Lycan...</i>

800
01:20:51,976 --> 01:20:54,938
<i>this may at last be a time of peace.</i>

801
01:20:56,314 --> 01:20:58,817
<i>We must once again
tend to our wounded...</i>

802
01:20:58,983 --> 01:21:00,443
<i>honor our fallen.</i>

803
01:21:00,610 --> 01:21:04,030
<i>Our final two covens
must find strength and unity...</i>

804
01:21:04,531 --> 01:21:06,991
<i>to heal and rise from the ashes.</i>

805
01:21:13,665 --> 01:21:15,834
<i>My journey has now come full circle.</i>

806
01:21:16,001 --> 01:21:20,255
<i>Once an outcast, I am now one
of three chosen Elders.</i>

807
01:21:20,422 --> 01:21:22,590
<i>From hunted to the highest honor.</i>

808
01:21:48,241 --> 01:21:50,535
<i>I have lived 1000 years.</i>

809
01:21:50,702 --> 01:21:53,121
<i>I may live 1000 more...</i>

810
01:21:53,288 --> 01:21:55,623
<i>or I may die tomorrow.</i>

811
01:21:58,209 --> 01:22:00,462
<i>But I no longer fear death...</i>

812
01:22:00,628 --> 01:22:03,548
<i>for I have known it once already.</i>

813
01:22:06,551 --> 01:22:07,886
<i>I am reborn...</i>

814
01:22:08,053 --> 01:22:11,014
<i>and my eyes have been opened
to the Sacred World...</i>

815
01:22:11,181 --> 01:22:14,017
<i>and to the promise
of what is yet to be.</i>

816
01:22:16,811 --> 01:22:18,855
<i>There is no beginning.</i>

817
01:22:19,230 --> 01:22:21,149
<i>There is no end.</i>

818
01:22:22,317 --> 01:22:24,694
<i>There is only becoming.</i>
