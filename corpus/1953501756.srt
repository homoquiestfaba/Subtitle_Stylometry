1
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:06,398
Last year, lakagigar last erupted
in 1783, ultimately killing

2
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,268
Over 6 million people. The
ash cloud is beginning to

3
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,904
Spread east toward the
uk and europe beyond...

4
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,849
Are these figure just
preliminary?

5
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:27,086
Yes, the eruption began
only 15 minutes ago.

6
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:30,689
And yet, it's exactly as we
predicted.

7
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:37,529
12 kilometer high plumes, 2000 tons of ash
per second, the multiple earthquakes.

8
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:42,634
This is going to carry on for a few days,
we'd better start revising the model.

9
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,870
We'll need data from the
other sites as well.

10
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:50,542
Call the monitoring stations, I want
facts, before I call the authorities.

11
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:52,411
You really think this is it?

12
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:56,215
If the data holds to the
model, I think it is.

13
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,526
Oh really? Again?

14
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:09,294
What's up perkins?

15
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:13,065
Isis erupted again. It's an
annual event, apparently.

16
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:16,024
First it was ian, a year ago.
Then greenverner.

17
00:02:16,037 --> 00:02:19,004
And now lakagigar.

18
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:23,142
Wonderful language skills you got there.
Be careful, you'll get a posting there.

19
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:24,710
So how bad?

20
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:26,712
Probably the strongest yet.

21
00:02:26,714 --> 00:02:30,349
It only happened about an hours ago, and
it had already reached 17 kilometers.

22
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,891
17 kilometers? You know,
that is really bad.

23
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:35,454
What's the spread?

24
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:36,889
Winds aren't too strong.

25
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:38,690
Alright keep me posted.

26
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,650
Oh one moment. What's
happening with that

27
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:45,364
little storm system in
the northwest atlantic?

28
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:49,635
It's gathering strength.
Temperature is down 12 degrees.

29
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:52,504
Pressure is down
by 240 milibars.

30
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,607
If that crosses the ash cloud,
it would rather a mess.

31
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,709
Yes it will.

32
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:01,413
Alright, if there is even a possibility
of a major grounding, the sooner the

33
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:04,283
People know the better.
Spread the good news.

34
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:05,284
Will do cornel.

35
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,090
Thank you control. This is 165
out.

36
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:15,027
What was that all about? An ash
cloud?

37
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,296
Not much I hope.

38
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:22,334
Morava nb1765. Reduce altitude
<i>to 30,000 ft and report.</i>

39
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:26,505
Roger that control. 1765,
reducing altitude.

40
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,276
Ah, there it is. The coast.

41
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,448
Ah, the septedial. This blessed
plot.

42
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,616
What's that?

43
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:39,451
Shakespeare darling.

44
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:40,686
Oh, right of course.

45
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:41,820
[laughing]

46
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:43,288
Lucky you are so handsome.

47
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,923
[laughing]

48
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:47,092
Why are they having you reduce
altitude?

49
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:50,062
Oh, I'm sure it's just
an air traffic issue.

50
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:53,699
Control, this is 1765.
We are at 30,000 feet.

51
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:57,603
<i>Roger, 1765. Stand by for
further instructions.</i>

52
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:59,871
Roger that.

53
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:01,762
Four years ago my team
built a model predicting

54
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,675
icelandic volcanic
activity and this

55
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:08,614
Morning's eruption hews almost exactly to
the parameters established in that model.

56
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:13,952
The amount of ash and lava,
the 5.5 magnitude earthquake.

57
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:18,824
Consequently, we believe the second
phase we predicted will shortly begin.

58
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:23,729
A series of linked eruptions throughout
northern and central europe.

59
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:26,031
Oh god.

60
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,899
What we are going to see is the seismic
activity of one volcano triggering the next

61
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:30,569
Along the fault lines at the
edge of the tectonic plate.

62
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:33,372
I've never heard of such a thing. -You
cant be serious. -No no no no no no

63
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:40,412
Germany, Italy, France,
greece...

64
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:43,115
It could be a matter
of days, if not hours.

65
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:47,786
Oh my oh no, dr. This is a
complete disaster, this can't be.

66
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,688
A disaster of this nature.
Your figures must be mistaken.

67
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:54,593
Please, please no one wants to
cause a panic, but you should

68
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:58,897
Begin making arrangements to move
people from the affected areas.

69
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:02,668
And what exactly are the
affected areas?

70
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:08,040
Approximately 83% of
the european landmass.

71
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:12,611
You ok right? I mean this isn't
a 747, champagne, caviar, and

72
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:14,179
All that fancy stuff.

73
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:17,582
No, this is fun. It's romantic.
Just the two of us.

74
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:20,652
Well my ex didn't like
flying in small planes.

75
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:25,190
Her loss. What about you?

76
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:27,025
Not wishing this was a fighter
jet?

77
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:30,696
[laughs] I'll let you know young lady.
I've flew e-3's.

78
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:35,867
Right. You know what I meant. You
sure you don't miss the air force?

79
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:38,970
I don't miss the air force. I've had
enough danger for one lifetime now.

80
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:43,141
Now it's just quality time. Quality
romantic time with my new beautiful wife.

81
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:48,280
[laughs]you're sweet. But you don't
have to keep selling. I'm already here.

82
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:52,884
I'm not selling. I just find
it unbelievable sometimes.

83
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,788
[sigh]
kids are going to love you.

84
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,723
Maybe.

85
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:59,257
They will.

86
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,759
Well, I won't take it personally
if they are resentful.

87
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:03,628
1765, you're on route
to paris <i>le bourget.</i>

88
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,997
Roger that control.

89
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:08,033
<i>I'm afraid all non-emergency air traffic
is being grounded immediately due to</i>

90
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:12,304
Atmospheric conditions. You'll
<i>have to land at london city.</i>

91
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:14,773
Control. We can be in paris
is less then an hour.

92
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:19,511
That's a negative 1765, reduce
<i>altitude to 25,000 feet and report.</i>

93
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:23,148
Roger that control.
1765 reducing altitude.

94
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,883
I don't see any clouds.

95
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,186
It must be coming in faster then
expected.

96
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,656
Our temperature is dropping.
Look at the outometer

97
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,093
There is a barometric
abnormality.

98
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:37,929
May be it's just as well we are
landing.

99
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:39,498
You think the kids are going to
be ok?

100
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,800
They'll be fine. This must
be all over the news.

101
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:43,368
Still you should check in.

102
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,138
I'll give them a call when we
land.

103
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,513
I wonder when that could
is going to reach us.

104
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:58,316
Hopefully not until dad and
what's her name get here.

105
00:06:58,318 --> 00:06:59,584
Lacey?

106
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,453
Whatever.

107
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:07,225
Ok, so we have 4, we have 5 stops
until we get to gala dulles.

108
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:09,728
No we got to take a bus to the
airport?

109
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,965
Or should we just take a train?

110
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,268
Ryan?

111
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,805
Hello? Ryan?

112
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,740
It's like the freakin' end of
the world coming. Can you stop

113
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:23,975
Being a perve long
enough to pay attention.

114
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,511
There is nothing perverted about
admiring a beautiful woman.

115
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:29,815
It is when you do it to every
single woman that walks by.

116
00:07:29,817 --> 00:07:31,983
It's paris. You know?

117
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:35,687
The whole reason I'm going to grad school
here is to experience another culture.

118
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:40,792
Right. And I thought cause every
single woman in america shot you down.

119
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,727
[laughs]

120
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:44,351
Anyway, it's probably not
the end of the world.

121
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:45,997
Just an ash cloud.

122
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:51,403
It's like that ia-ge-fur... Whatever how
you pronounce it, went off years back

123
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:53,472
They just cancelled flights
and that was the end of it.

124
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:56,608
Do you think it's going
to affect dad's flight?

125
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,076
Let's hope not.

126
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:04,883
Man, you know, I really have to
visit that thing before I graduate.

127
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:07,652
What? You haven't been
to the eiffel tower?

128
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:11,523
Oh my god, ryan what is wrong
with you?

129
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:12,757
Such a loser.

130
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:16,094
You know tyran, you might
consider being nicer to me.

131
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:17,535
You really think that
mom and dad would have

132
00:08:17,548 --> 00:08:18,997
let you transfer to
the parson's program

133
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,099
If I wasn't already here in
paris?

134
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,534
Their little girl.

135
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:25,237
[baby voice] awll awone
in a fowegn country.

136
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:27,672
No way. Especially with your
history.

137
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:33,879
I don't need a baby sitter. I'm fine.
In fact, I'm doing great.

138
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,714
So glad to hear it.

139
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:39,417
That's why I want to get to the airport.
Not on time but early.

140
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,077
I want dad to see that I'm not
this little girl no more.

141
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,458
And this semester
has matured me.

142
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,827
So he'll pony up for the summer
session?

143
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:54,065
I just want him to be proud of me.
Even though he is midlife crisising.

144
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:54,866
Agh, tyran?

145
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,968
What?

146
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,671
The ink is not even dry on the divorce and
he runs off to marry some random chick.

147
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:02,340
Mom left him. What do you want him to do?
Sit around crying

148
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:05,210
Around and apologizing for
the rest of his life?

149
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,012
Yeah. Sounds about right.

150
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:09,714
How many times did mom
spend crying and alone.

151
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:11,983
The guy is a pilot, of course
he's going to have to...

152
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,908
You know what? We're not doing this.
You and

153
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:15,854
I are not having our
own little version

154
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:18,290
Of the same fight mom and
dad had for 20 years.

155
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:20,725
They divorced. Dad remarried.

156
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:24,563
Yeah. Some chick he knew 5 minutes.
Who's my age. That's gross.

157
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,732
She's older.

158
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,000
Still.

159
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:32,938
Well, we are still doing alright on time.
They probably haven't hit England yet.

160
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,874
Alright, I just don't
wanna take any chances.

161
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,610
You know how dad is about
punctuality.

162
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:43,281
If we're late we're grounded ...
For life.

163
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,719
Control. This is 1765.
We're at 20,000 feet.

164
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:52,791
Roger 1765, switch to
119.725 <i>for london city.</i>

165
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:54,960
Roger that control.

166
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:57,262

We're at 12,000 feet.

223
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:59,270
Yes I'll be on my way colonel and I
will explain more in detail when I

224
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:02,807
Arrive at the base but in the meantime
I don't think we can afford to

225
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:05,710
Wait for the authorities to take
action.

226
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:08,279
Doctor, I do not understand.

227
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:13,384
The multiple eruptions and earthquakes are
linked colonel, there's far more magma,

228
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:16,020
Ash and sulpher dioxide being
released than predicted.

229
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:21,793
The result is something, something
we've never seen before.

230
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:24,996
The model I sent you should help
explain it, do you have it open?

231
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:27,398
Yes, yes I've got the model
open.

232
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,535
Then you should be able to see
the fault lines, which exist

233
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,338
Along the edges of
the tectonic plate.

234
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,139
Okay

235
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:38,877
Would you please get me a warmer
jacket and a clean shirt?

236
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:41,746
Sorry about that colonel, as I
was saying.

237
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:44,382
Do you mind if I put you on
speakerphone for a moment?

238
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,185
Of course not.

239
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:50,455
As I was saying it was a massive
tectonic shift in the mid atlantic

240
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:53,591
Rift under iceland that caused
a chain reaction earthquakes

241
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,593
And volcanic eruptions
across the continent.

242
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:58,930
But currently, the ash clouds
from these separate eruptions

243
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:01,266
Are merging and spreading as
one through the atmosphere.

244
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:06,404
And because the cloud are blocking out
the sun, temperatures are falling.

245
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,172
Yes, but...

246
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:11,643
Due to the pre-existing storm
system in the north atlantic,

247
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:13,912
The glacial melt has
increased exponentially.

248
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,587
Look, how can that be?
Temperatures falling?

249
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,151
Glaciers melting?

250
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:22,720
Surely that means temperatures
are rising.

251
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:26,758
No, because the chemical make up of
volcanic debris sends increased sulfide

252
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,562
Levels into the atmosphere,
thus increasing precipitation.

253
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:36,634
Alright, alright. How long is it going
to take before this cloud dissipates?

254
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:40,471
Click the blue tab on the model,
will you?

255
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:43,808
Well the cloud is projected to block
the sun for the next eighteen to

256
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,511
Twenty four months at least.
And all that time,

257
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:51,950
Temperatures will continue to plummet.
Is it snowing there yet?

258
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:53,217
What?

259
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,020
No. No no it's not.

260
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:58,856
Good, it's only a matter of
time.

261
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:03,761
Doctor, how much snow are
we talking about here?

262
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:08,633
Given the enormous amount of
moisture rising into the atmosphere.

263
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,602
Look, we're still working
on the model for that.

264
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:14,172
It should be ready by the time I
reach the base, will that do?

265
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:20,111
Yes of course. Wait one moment doctor.
Let me quite clear about this.

266
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:27,051
What you're saying is that this storm
will persist in a matter of years.

267
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:32,357
What is going to happen to europe? I mean,
how much of europe will remain habitable?

268
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:35,499
I don't wish to engage
in hyperbole colonel.

269
00:16:35,512 --> 00:16:38,663
I'm receiving new
data just right now.

270
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,932
I'll really have to
get back to you.

271
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:48,139
Have we heard from headquarters
lately?

272
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:51,109
I think we should give them a
little call.

273
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:54,885
And um, I'd like to review
the emergency protocols.

274
00:16:54,898 --> 00:16:58,683
If this thing is going
to go pear shaped

275
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,284
I think we awt to be prepared.

276
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,687
See to it.

and volcanic eruptions in iceland

And the european
continent are also

279
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:17,668
Affecting the arctic circle. Scientists
in murmansk report glacial breaks as

280
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,871
Long as ten kilometers,
while experts from

281
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:24,409
The byrd polar research center estimate
the rise in sea level from rapidly

282
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:29,580
Melting polar ice will flood coastal
cities in scandinavia and beyond.

283
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:32,917
Residents of those areas are advised
to move inland as quickly as possible

284
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:36,954
To ensure their own safety. To allow
government officials to make preparations

285

Against this global phenomenon.

try the staffline phone.

figure out a game plan here.

Listen guys, we are going
to be grounded here in

because of the weather.

310
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,182
So why don't you hold
up in the apartment and

311
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:51,629
after it clears up we'll reconnect.
How is that?

The plan is to get a nice hotel room
and start our honeymoon right now.

328
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:22,393
You know if the planes are going to be
grounded, the roads and the trains are

329
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:26,797
Going to be packed. Maybe we
should head to paris right now.

00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:33,604
Good idea.

335
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:36,040
Ok, I'll go rent us a car and you
book us a ticket on the eurostar.

336
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:39,877
Sounds good. May be on the way there we can
get some winter gear for us and the kids.

337
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:40,845
That's a good idea.

338
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:41,846
Yeah.

339
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:44,982
Let's go to the market before
we go home, if there's a

340
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:47,185
Storm coming, it'll be good to
stock up.

341
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,252
Sure.

342
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,255
Taryn.

343
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:57,395
I guess that's the ash cloud.

344
00:19:57,397 --> 00:20:00,398
I guess it is.

345
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,669
Whoo, did you feel that,
it just got really cold.

346
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:07,538
Yeah weird, let's get going.

347
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,806
[breaths]
yeah

348
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:17,815
[screams]

349
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:19,850
Cmon! Cmon!

350
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:21,452
[screams]

351
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,124
Oh god, ryan!

352
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:30,094
Ryan, ryan are you ok?!

353
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:33,364
I think so, nice going t.

354
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:39,170
Soccer kicks footballs ass.

355
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:42,707
Ok cmon, it's not safe.

356
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,976
Cmon, we gotta get outa here.

357
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:51,515
Any luck?

358
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:54,885
No but I've gotten to hear "do you really
wanna hurt me" eighty seven times.

359
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:56,454
[laughs]

360
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:59,156
I will never look at boy
george the same way again.

361
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:02,693
This weather's a mess, why don't we just
get a motel for the night and we'll

362
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:04,595
Get an early start
in the morning?

363
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:07,732
Steve, why is it me that's
pushing you to see your kids?

364
00:21:07,734 --> 00:21:08,833
What?

365
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:11,168
Shouldn't this be all your idea?

366
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:15,640
Well, I guess it should be. I guess I have
to get used to thinking like a good parent.

367
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:17,908
Mhm

368
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,244
It'll be a little difficult considering I
was always told I was such a bad husband...

369
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:23,180
Well...It takes two to
make a marriage work.

370
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:23,714
It does...

371
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:25,316
Or not work.

372
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:29,387
Listen I love you, and I
know you're a good man.

373
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:29,720
Thank you honey.

374
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,260
God, I can't believe it's
snowing.

375
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,797
Check the radio, see what's
going on.

376
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,699
Ok.

377
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:44,368
Potentially the worst snow storms
since 1908, when more than

378
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:47,705
26 inches fell over three days in April.
Currently in

379
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:52,043
London the temperature is below zero and
dropping steadily. Dozens of cities

380
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:55,980
Around the nation are without power,
but we will continue to broadcast

381
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,581
As long as are able.

382
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,519
This can't be right.

383
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:03,621
How certain are you?

384
00:22:03,623 --> 00:22:06,057
The projection is based on
current data.

385
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:10,067
16 inches of ash will cover europe?
The sun

386
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,098
will be blocked out by
this cloud for 2 years.

387
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:18,436
Earthquakes, after shocks. Temperatures
will fall below zero and remain there.

388
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:27,078
And snow will continue to fall more or
less continuously for the next 22 months.

389
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,782
My god man. This is an
unmanageable catastrophe.

390
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:38,656
Well it's a situation colonel, like I said,
I don't like to engage in hyperbole.

391
00:22:38,658 --> 00:22:42,093
Hyperbole! Hyperbole!

392
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:43,951
Good god man if these
projections are correct.

393
00:22:43,964 --> 00:22:45,830
Europe on the large
portion of the

394
00:22:45,832 --> 00:22:50,468
Northern hemisphere, have just
entered into a new ice age.

395
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:57,842
At least the hail stopped. Do you want
to head home or go to the market?

396
00:22:57,844 --> 00:23:00,133
Let's do both. Let's go
get some boat , jackets.

397
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:02,446
Let's stock up on food
and water and hold

398
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:04,181
Up in the flat like dad said,
ok?

399
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:11,455
Ok. Sounds like a plan.

400
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:14,024
Ryan, what are you doing,
you're such a cluts.

401
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:16,594
I didn't anything. You
think it's the metro?

402
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:17,561
Look.

403
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:32,143
[rumble/ explosion]

404
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:38,315
[rumble/ explosion]

405
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:39,850
[scream]
help me!

406
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:41,051
Earthquake!

407
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:42,453
Ryan!

408
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:43,621
[groan]

409
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:58,369
[rumble/ shattered glass]

410
00:23:58,371 --> 00:23:59,036
What?

411
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:00,004
Come with me.

412
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:01,739
No no no it's fine.

413
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:03,174
Come with me.

414
00:24:03,176 --> 00:24:05,309
No no no. My brother. Ryan!

415
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:06,944
[speaking french]

416
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,212
My brother is there.

417
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:11,081
He's probably dead. I can save
you.

418
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,183
Let me go!

419
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:13,751
You are panicking. Come with me.

420
00:24:13,753 --> 00:24:14,618
Let me go!

421
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,553
Come on.

422
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:16,787
Ok. If you insist.

423
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,155
[groan]
ooww!

424
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:19,557
Asshole.

425
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,526
Ryan!

426
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:29,166
Ryan! Are you ok?

427
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:33,103
Taryn? You ok?

428
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:34,738
I asked you first.

429
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:38,642
Ah! It sucked. I think I hit my
head.

430
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:41,400
I got hit on by some
crazy french guy in the

431
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,447
middle of this earthquake.
Whatever it is.

432
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:47,384
[rumble]
another earthquake.

433
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,458
We got to get outta here.

434
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,759
Let's go.

435
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:07,538
Do you think the earthquakes are related
to the ash cloud? Or the volcanoes?

436
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,440
I don't know. We should keep
moving.

437
00:25:09,442 --> 00:25:11,308
Where are we going to go?

438
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,210
I don't know. The embassy?
They've got to have some kind of

439
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:15,079
Emergency plan to protect
american citizens.

440
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:17,481
It's so cold.

441
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:21,118
What are we gonna do? Ryan I'm scared.
I'm really scared.

442
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,920
Be scared later.

443
00:25:22,922 --> 00:25:28,225
[rumble]

444
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:30,261
Taryn! Taryn!

445
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:36,433
Go! Go! Go! Go!

446
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:47,545
You think it's over?

447
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:53,584
I don't know it fells like
it's just the beginning.

448
00:25:53,586 --> 00:25:56,854
Oh man, look at that. Totally
smashed.

449
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,724
Do your phone work?

450
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:04,528
There's no signal.

451
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:06,230
Maybe at the embassy?

452
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,332
Let go to place de la concorde.

453
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,935
[out of breath] at least the
earthquake has stopped.

454
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:12,403
For now.

455
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:13,571
Come on, let's go.

456
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:18,576
Preliminary reports put the temblor
at 8.4 on the richter scale.

457
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:21,579
Hospitals are overwhelmed with
with wounded, and thousands

458
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:24,515
Are still unaccounted for in
the sudden wreckage littering

459
00:26:24,517 --> 00:26:27,785
Paris. While the city has
seen minor earthquakes in its

460
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:31,722
History, never has there been
anything of this severity. Even

461
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:36,327
The italian quake of 1908
was only 7.5 magnitude...

462
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:38,228
Ok im calling the kids again.

463
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,997
No, no I've got another idea.

464
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:42,199
Ok who are we calling?

465
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:45,336
Colonel ralph dillard, we served together
in desert storm. He's with nato now

466
00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:49,106
But he's commander of geilenkirchen,
he'll know what's going on.

467
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:49,907
[phone ringing]

468
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:50,975
Hello.

469
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:53,043
Ralph, steve foster here.

470
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:55,879
Steve. This is not a good
time to talk I'm afraid.

471
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:59,183
No I understand that sir, I'm in
England and my kids are in paris.

472
00:26:59,185 --> 00:27:01,852
Paris? Have you spoken to them?

473
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:05,122
Yeah about three hours ago but
not since the earthquake sir.

474
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:07,257
My dear fellow I'm so sorry.

475
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:10,794
No no no that's alright they're smart
kids they're probably alright I'm sure.

476
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:15,532
Oh yes of course. I didn't mean
... Oh

477
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:17,267
We're heading to paris right
now.

478
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:18,936
How are you getting there?

479
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:21,038
We're going to the euro tunnel
to put the car on the train.

480
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,072
Have you made a booking?

481
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:23,741
No we can't get through.

482
00:27:23,743 --> 00:27:26,443
Alright, I may be able to help you there.
What's your eta?

483
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:29,213
Little over an hour or so depending
on the weather and traffic.

484
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:33,851
Alright. I'm in germany but I got
a friend of mine in truckston.

485
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:34,785
Thanks ralph.

486
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:35,953
What about the kids?

487
00:27:35,955 --> 00:27:37,655
What's that?

488
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:40,190
The kids, we haven't spoken with
'em since before the earthquake.

489
00:27:40,192 --> 00:27:44,061
They don't know we're coming, and
we don't know where they're at.

490
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:49,700
Well the good news is the mobile system in
paris is still working. It's crowded but

491
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:52,936
Keep trying and you may get
through.

492
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:55,305
What's the bad news, more
earthquakes?

493
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:57,274
The earthquakes are the
least of our problems.

494
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:59,410
Then what's the bigger problem?

495
00:27:59,412 --> 00:28:05,549
Look, steve. This ash cloud combined with
a freak storm and some circumstances

496
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:10,754
That I don't fully understand.
Anyway the long story short ... The

497
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:15,726
Cold is going to get colder. And
the snow is going to get deeper.

498
00:28:15,728 --> 00:28:19,096
Tell me there's a way
out of this, colonel.

499
00:28:19,098 --> 00:28:25,169
Steve. Europe is finished. This
is a global crisis. Now think

500
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:29,339
Back to your emergency protocols.
They are executing

501
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:32,015
Operation, down under..
We are going to

502
00:28:32,028 --> 00:28:34,712
evacuate all plato
personal & their families

503
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:41,051
To australia. I will have c-160's leaving
every 2 hours for the next 10 hours.

504
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:45,989
If you can get here, I premises you, I

677
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:55,191
Excuse me I have a reservation.

678
00:39:55,193 --> 00:39:56,025
Departure hanger?

679
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:58,027
What's that?

680
00:39:58,029 --> 00:40:00,330
You can't board without a departure hanger.
The machine is over there.

681
00:40:00,332 --> 00:40:03,366
Can you just check, it's steve
foster, foster, f- o-s-t.

682
00:40:03,368 --> 00:40:05,702
I can here you. I just don't
care.

683
00:40:05,704 --> 00:40:08,037
I don't think you understand,
colonel dillard called

684
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:09,672
Personally to make a
reservation for me.

685
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:12,041
If you have a reservation, you
get your departure hanger over

686
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:14,544
There. Not that it'll do any
good.

687
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:16,246
And why's that?

688
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:20,383
They are hours behind. Those people
where meant to be on the 9am.

689
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:22,585
And they have been here all day.

690
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:32,695
I hear that the next train might be
the last because of the weather.

691
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:40,904
I hear that the next train might be
the last because of the weather.

692
00:40:40,906 --> 00:40:44,174
Steve!

693
00:40:44,176 --> 00:40:46,309
What the hell are you doing?

694
00:40:46,311 --> 00:40:48,511
We're not gonna get a pass, the whole
system's falling apart and we're running

695
00:40:48,513 --> 00:40:51,748
Out of time. Let's try to use the
service tunnel. Call the kids.

696
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:59,255
[cell ringing]

697
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:01,257
Is that your phone? No way!
It's still working?

698
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:05,929
Yeah it's dad, hello dad, where are
you guys, did you hear what happened?

699
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:07,564
Taryn thank god, listen it's
lacey.

700
00:41:07,566 --> 00:41:09,466
They alright?

701
00:41:09,468 --> 00:41:12,769
Uh, your father's busy driving are you ok?,
is, is your brother with you? Is he safe?

702
00:41:12,771 --> 00:41:16,973
Ryan is here. We're fine. We're
fine but the city is horrible.

703
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:20,043
Ok listen everything's going
to be fine, we have a plan.

704
00:41:20,045 --> 00:41:21,344
Ok, what's the plan?

705
00:41:21,346 --> 00:41:23,680
We need a place to rendezvous.

706
00:41:23,682 --> 00:41:27,984
Ok listen, we need a place we can find you,
what do you see around you, what's nearby?

707
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:31,154
Nothing. Nothing it's all gone.

708
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:32,622
What are they asking?

709
00:41:32,624 --> 00:41:35,225
They need a place to meet us.
The embassy?

710
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,698
The tower.

711
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,367
The eiffel tower, it's still
there.

712
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:46,469
They say the eiffel
tower's still standing.

713
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:47,760
Perfect, tell 'em to
go to the tower and

714
00:41:47,773 --> 00:41:49,072
find a safe place to
stay and look out for a

715
00:41:49,074 --> 00:41:53,676
Helicopter. We'll be there, it'll
take some time but we'll get there.

716
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:05,255
Corporal I'm major foster, us air force.
I need access to the service tunnel.

717
00:42:05,257 --> 00:42:07,557
Sorry sir, this tunnel
is for emergencies only.

718
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:10,426
This is an emergency corporal,
I need to get to France.

719
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:12,629
So do all those people.

720
00:42:12,631 --> 00:42:15,798
My children are stranded in paris
corporal, I need to get to them.

721
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,602
My mom's in reykjavík. We
haven't spoken since yesterday.

722
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:25,208
I understand sir.

723
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:32,015
What's the problem?

724
00:42:32,017 --> 00:42:33,850
He's not gonna let us
through

725
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:42,325
Look at that!

726
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:47,163
When more people realize
they won't get through.

727
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:50,166
It's getting ugly out there. And
it's only going to get worse

728
00:42:50,168 --> 00:42:51,868
We're running out of time.
They're going to close this

729
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,570
Tunnel and we're never
going to get out of here.

730
00:42:57,174 --> 00:42:58,808
Ah the hell with it. Hold on.

731
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,881
Alright, we're on our way.

732
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:11,721
Whoo I'm freezing my ass off.
We need coats.

733
00:43:11,723 --> 00:43:12,722
You're telling me.

734
00:43:12,724 --> 00:43:15,197
Hey look, best case scenario.
They're not gonna

735
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:17,694
be here for another 3
hours, probably more.

736
00:43:17,696 --> 00:43:19,596
Yeah.

737
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:21,564
So why don't we go find coats and
somewhere warm where we can rest a while.

738
00:43:21,566 --> 00:43:23,967
Ok but I don't want to want
to miss them at the tower.

739
00:43:23,969 --> 00:43:26,075
Neither do I. We get
pneumonia out here, we're

740
00:43:26,088 --> 00:43:28,204
not going to be doing
anyone any favors.

741
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:34,844
They're still in England, right? They have
to find the helicopter where ever the hell

742
00:43:34,846 --> 00:43:39,415
That is. Then fly to paris. It's
gonna be a while. And it's cold.

743
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:45,388
Ok. Where do you want to go?

744
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:47,590
Uh, I don't know. This way?

745
00:43:47,592 --> 00:43:50,860
At least it's in the
direction of the louvre.

746
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:53,162
What is it? What is it? What is
it?

747
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:55,131
The army is rounding up people
probably for evacuation.

748
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,666
Well that's a good thing right?

749
00:43:56,668 --> 00:43:58,968
Not if it stops us from
getting to lacey and dad.

750
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:03,539
Whatever is going on here. Staying at a
refugee camp is not gonna save us ok?

751
00:44:03,541 --> 00:44:04,607
C'mon.

752
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:11,347
Wait ryan? The cold. It's freezing. I don't
want to die out here in the streets.

753
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:13,416
Here. Here. Let me think.

754
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:15,785
Where are we?

755
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:19,789
Avenue george. I know what we
can do.

756
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:20,857
What?

757
00:44:20,859 --> 00:44:23,726
Run to the fourreur industries.
C'mon.

758
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:29,132
See.

759
00:44:29,134 --> 00:44:31,234
They actually teach you something
useful in fashion school, huh.

760
00:44:31,935 --> 00:44:33,336
Let's go.

761
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:40,810
I don't think there's anyone
here.

762
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:43,279
It doesn't look like
there's anything here.

763
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:47,550
I guess we are not the 1st people to think
of fourreur's would be a good stop huh.

764
00:44:47,552 --> 00:44:49,519
There's gotta be something.

765
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:57,794
Hey. Maybe downstairs. There's gotta
be a stock room or something right?

766
00:44:57,796 --> 00:45:01,698
We're going to shop. I'm not
going back out there like this.

767
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:11,307
Bingo.

768
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:13,676
Here try this.

769
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,815
Oh, better?

770
00:45:18,817 --> 00:45:19,816
Much.

771
00:45:19,818 --> 00:45:20,817
Oh, we got lucky.

772
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:22,351
Relatively speaking.

773
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:27,957
[man speaking french]

774
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:32,028
[ryan answering in french]

775
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:34,097
Of course you don't speak
french.

776
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:35,465
Typical americans.

777
00:45:35,467 --> 00:45:37,366
We're sorry. We didn't think-

778
00:45:37,368 --> 00:45:39,769
You didn't think I'd mind being
robbed.

779
00:45:39,771 --> 00:45:43,506
The lootters already took most of my coats.
But you won't get these.

780
00:45:43,508 --> 00:45:45,641
Sir, please we don't meet any harm.
We just-

781
00:45:45,643 --> 00:45:47,877
You know how it is out there.
It's freezing.

782
00:45:47,879 --> 00:45:49,879
It's only getting colder.
We need these coats.

783
00:45:49,881 --> 00:45:52,615
Then you buy them like anyone
else.

784
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:55,585
Ok yeah. Fine sure. How much?

785
00:45:55,587 --> 00:45:59,044
Price is determined by need.
And your need is great.

786
00:45:59,057 --> 00:46:02,525
So the price is
will be great also.

787
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:09,532
I'd say ... 20,000 euros.
A piece.

788
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:11,634
20,000 euros? That's ridiculous.

789
00:46:11,636 --> 00:46:13,736
Yeah. Who's robbing who here?

790
00:46:13,738 --> 00:46:15,404
Please sir. Be reasonable.

791
00:46:15,406 --> 00:46:20,877
Leave my money or leave my coats.
[click] or leave both.

792
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:32,060
We're making good time,
as long as the roads

793
00:46:32,073 --> 00:46:34,490
ahead of us are as good
as they were in England.

794
00:46:34,492 --> 00:46:36,058
And no more earthquakes.

795
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,660
Don't jinx it.

796
00:46:37,662 --> 00:46:39,929
It's not the snow I'm so
worried about, it's the wind.

797
00:46:39,931 --> 00:46:40,797
Steve.

798
00:46:40,799 --> 00:46:42,765
Right, my lips are sealed.

799
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:46,803
This really is what you do isn't
it?

800
00:46:46,805 --> 00:46:48,237
What's that?

801
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:51,340
Keep cool in a crisis, rise to
the challenge, find solutions.

802
00:46:51,342 --> 00:46:55,178
Well, that is what I was trained for,
unfortunately I wasn't trained in raising a

803
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:56,612
Family, but it's going to work this
time I promise you, no it will work.

804
00:46:56,614 --> 00:46:58,014
Yeah it's gonna work.

805
00:46:58,016 --> 00:47:00,449
It's gonna work, I'll make sure
it works.

806
00:47:00,451 --> 00:47:03,225
Australia will be the
true test of that. All

807
00:47:03,238 --> 00:47:06,022
four of us livin' in a
little tent together?

808
00:47:06,024 --> 00:47:08,380
Australia, I wonder what
that's going to be like...

809
00:47:08,393 --> 00:47:10,760
I'll certainly get
to know your kids.

810
00:47:10,762 --> 00:47:12,495
Yeah...

811
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:16,032
I'm sure they found some place in
paris to get some cold weather gear.

812
00:47:16,034 --> 00:47:18,267
Yeah I'm sure.

813
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:22,772
Knowing taryn, she probably spent 3000
dollars on some skimpy little ski jacket.

814
00:47:22,774 --> 00:47:24,707
[laugh]

815
00:47:24,709 --> 00:47:28,377
You know I think you're a much better
father than you give yourself credit for.

816
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:30,179
Well thanks.

817
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,882
I'm sure they're just a couple of
chips right off the old block.

818
00:47:32,884 --> 00:47:35,518
Well let's hope, right now our
mission is to find 'em, make

819
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,021
Sure they're safe and,
get them out of paris.

820
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:40,923
Roger that major..

821
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:47,296
Look, easy here. Here take my
credit card.

822
00:47:47,298 --> 00:47:48,931
Cash only. Mona mi.

823
00:47:48,933 --> 00:47:51,968
We don't have that kinda cash.
Who would? Please just...

824
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:54,470
We gotta get outta here.

825
00:47:54,472 --> 00:47:55,271
No.

826
00:47:55,273 --> 00:48:00,943
[efforts]

827
00:48:00,945 --> 00:48:02,511
[screams]

828
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,013
Taryn.

829
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:05,681
Ryan!

830
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,519
Ryan!

831
00:48:10,521 --> 00:48:11,520
Tyran!

832
00:48:11,522 --> 00:48:13,189
I'm trapped.

833
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:18,127
[efforts]
I can't lift it. It's too heavy.

834
00:48:18,129 --> 00:48:21,731
Oh my god the ceiling!
It's not gonna hold.

835
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Ryan hurry!

836
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:29,872
You gotta get me out.

837
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:32,675
Ryan!

838
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:36,913
I'm going to go for some help,
ok?

839
00:48:36,915 --> 00:48:39,982
Help? Where? Ryan, you
can't leave me here.

840
00:48:39,984 --> 00:48:41,790
Tyran, I have to. I can't
lift this by myself.

841
00:48:41,803 --> 00:48:43,619
We need help, ok?

842
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:45,655
Look, I won't be a minute,
alright?

843
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:48,791
Ryan! Ryan, you can't leave me
here.

844
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:54,797
Just hang tight. I'll be right back, ok?
I promise.

845
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,873
Hey help! Help! Hey.

846
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:06,842
Hey!

847
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,146
Sir. You got to help me.

848
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:13,249
[speaking french]

849
00:49:13,251 --> 00:49:15,718
Hey. It's you.

850
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:18,109
My sister ... Um she's
downstairs, she's trapped.

851
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:20,256
<i>S'il vous plait</i> . Please.

852
00:49:20,258 --> 00:49:24,060
[speaking french]

853
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:47,216
Ryan, you didn't bring anybody?

854
00:49:47,218 --> 00:49:49,885
It's crazy out there but I
brought this.

855
00:49:49,887 --> 00:49:53,656
I'm going to lift it up as high as I can.
You run as fast as you can out, ok?

856
00:49:53,658 --> 00:49:54,623
Ok, do it!

857
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:56,492
1...2...3.

858
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:59,195
[cracking]

859
00:49:59,197 --> 00:50:00,563
Higher.

860
00:50:00,565 --> 00:50:01,964
I'm trying.

861
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:07,703
Go. Go. Go.

862
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:21,617
[windows breaking/boulders]

863
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:24,587
Ryan, thank you so much.

864
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,294
Sorry I called you a pervert.

865
00:50:32,296 --> 00:50:36,165
[laughs] that's the 1st thing you
think of to apologize to me for?

866
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,533
Shut up.

867
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:38,434
Ok.

868
00:50:38,436 --> 00:50:39,769
Ouch!

869
00:50:39,771 --> 00:50:41,003
How bad is that?

870
00:50:41,005 --> 00:50:42,705
Damn these were 200 dollar
jeans.

871
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:44,974
Right but are ya gonna die of
tetanus?

872
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:48,677
It hurts but the cut is not that deep.
I'll be fine.

873
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:53,382
Ok, good. We need to get a cross the <i>sei</i>.
The tower is on the <i>rive droite.</i>

874
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:55,384
Wow ryan. That's impressive.

875
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:58,954
No not really. That's the only bit of
french I've learned since I've been here.

876
00:50:58,956 --> 00:51:01,690
That and "it's ok I'm a doctor."

877
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,194
Alright. Well let's find somewhere
warm and dry until they get here.

878
00:51:05,196 --> 00:51:07,463
Yeah. I could so go for a
nice cup of coffee right now.

879
00:51:07,465 --> 00:51:13,235
Mmm coffee. How about a hazelnut crepe?
Chocolate a claire? Foot rub?

880
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:16,338
Sarcasm isn't helpful right now
taryn.

881
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:18,541
Ana.

882
00:51:18,543 --> 00:51:19,975
Yes doctor?

883
00:51:19,977 --> 00:51:21,544
I want you to check my work.

884
00:51:21,546 --> 00:51:23,813
Sir.

885
00:51:23,815 --> 00:51:28,951
I think perhaps I've made a mistake because
what I'm looking at here is unprecedented.

886
00:51:28,953 --> 00:51:31,821
I can't send it to nato until
I am sure it is correct.

887
00:51:31,823 --> 00:51:34,056
Of course dr goldschein.

888
00:51:34,058 --> 00:51:37,766
Ana have you ever heard
about uh an ice cyclone?

889
00:51:37,779 --> 00:51:41,497
Is there any record
of such a thing?

890
00:51:41,499 --> 00:51:42,998
Not that I know of doctor.

891
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,202
Well, check the figures.

892
00:51:46,204 --> 00:51:50,873
Otherwise I wouldn't want to think what an
ice cyclone could do in a city like paris.

893
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:57,847
[thunder]

894
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,455
Was that an earthquake?

895
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:08,157
Maybe just a passing tremor.

896
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:12,094
Still, I'll feel safer when
we're above sea level again.

897
00:52:12,096 --> 00:52:14,363
About ten minutes and we'll be
up top.

898
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:23,939
Just a few miles to go now.

899
00:52:23,941 --> 00:52:25,574
Then how far to evreux?

900
00:52:25,576 --> 00:52:29,211
About two hours tops, depending
on the road conditions.

901
00:52:29,213 --> 00:52:32,148
I wonder which is going to be
worse, the main roads or the back.

902
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:34,884
What was that? Was that another
tremor?

903
00:52:34,886 --> 00:52:37,153
I don't know but I didn't
like the sound of it.

904
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:39,722
Another one, but, it's getting
closer.

905
00:52:39,724 --> 00:52:45,461
What is that?

906
00:52:45,463 --> 00:52:46,595
Steve!

907
00:52:46,597 --> 00:52:48,197
Holy cow!

908
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:49,298
What is that?

909
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,400
That's the english chanel coming
in.

910
00:52:51,402 --> 00:52:53,302
Just go!, just go.

911
00:52:57,741 --> 00:52:59,141
Go faster!

912
00:52:59,143 --> 00:53:01,410
I'm going fast, I git I I I got
it at max!

913
00:53:01,412 --> 00:53:03,012
Look, its right in front of
us you see it? Cmon cmon!

914
00:53:03,014 --> 00:53:04,580
No just, stay in the
gah I see it I see it!

915
00:53:04,582 --> 00:53:05,915
Come on. Come on.

916
00:53:05,917 --> 00:53:07,249
It's coming in everywhere look
at that!

917
00:53:07,251 --> 00:53:08,417
I see it.

918
00:53:08,419 --> 00:53:09,451
Look at that! It's getting
closer to us!

919
00:53:09,453 --> 00:53:11,420
Honey I see it.

920
00:53:11,422 --> 00:53:13,622
Just keep going! Go, it's coming in
behind us, it's getting closer, cmon!

921
00:53:13,624 --> 00:53:16,792
There's the exit! There's the exit!
Brace youself! Brace yourself!

922
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:26,869
How many dead?

923
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:29,939
Over a thousand. The trains were
full to capacity. Over full.

924
00:53:29,941 --> 00:53:31,947
Well, I suppose that
it's just a drop in the

925
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,976
bucket compared to the
millions are gonna

926
00:53:33,978 --> 00:53:36,212
Die before this is over.

927
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:40,082
And it was the 1pm departure?

928
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:45,788
[sigh]
that's the one I booked steve
on.

929
00:53:46,923 --> 00:53:48,991
[sigh]
he was a good man.

930
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:53,062
Anyway. I might be able to do
something for his children.

931
00:53:53,064 --> 00:53:55,764
Paris. They're evacuating
paris, aren't they?

932
00:53:55,766 --> 00:53:59,435
Yes sir. They've rounded up the survivors
and put them in temporary shelters.

933
00:53:59,437 --> 00:54:04,807
Right. Download pictures of the kids.
Send them to who ever is in charge.

934
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:06,842
And see if they can get them
here.

935
00:54:06,844 --> 00:54:08,483
But sir, why all this
effort for 2 americans?

936
00:54:08,496 --> 00:54:10,145
With all these sevilliance-

937
00:54:10,147 --> 00:54:13,215
Because I owe the man.

938
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,718
He saved my life once.

939
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:20,445
We flew together for years.
E3 centuries,

940
00:54:20,458 --> 00:54:24,660
desert storm, and a lot
of other operations.

941
00:54:24,662 --> 00:54:27,452
95 we were in alaska.
Took off on a perfectly

942
00:54:27,465 --> 00:54:30,266
clear day and injested
an entire flock

943
00:54:30,268 --> 00:54:35,037
Of canada gees. The plane went
down like a stone. Everyone on

944
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:37,172
Board were killed or
seriously wounded..

945
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:42,778
I was unconscious, steve was wounded but
he found me, pulled me out of the wreckage

946
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:47,016
And carried me on his back 3
miles back to headquarters.

947
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:50,819
We don't forget things like
that.

948
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:54,957
There is a chance they made it
through before the quake of course.

949
00:54:56,626 --> 00:55:00,462
Yes. Yes you are quite right.
He might have.

950
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:02,998
Alright, I'll try to get him on
his c-

951
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,136
But 1st sir, did you get a chance to
look at goldschein revized model?

952
00:55:07,138 --> 00:55:10,172
No no. I've been dealing
with operational matters.

953
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:12,141
What now?

954
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:14,710
Oh my god.

955
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,212
This is like a sick joke.

956
00:55:21,051 --> 00:55:23,886
If I said our luck was holdin' up
would you consider that a jinx?

957
00:55:23,888 --> 00:55:26,655
Well yeah, but now it's too
late.

958
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:27,790
Well we are ahead of schedule.

959
00:55:27,792 --> 00:55:29,858
[cellphone ringing]

960
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:32,294
Oh dillard's calling back

961
00:55:32,296 --> 00:55:34,263
Hello? Colonel dillard?

962
00:55:34,265 --> 00:55:37,766
Hello, steve? Steve this is
dillard.

963
00:55:37,768 --> 00:55:41,370
Um, uh, this is lacey
foster, steve's wife.

964
00:55:41,372 --> 00:55:43,672
I can't understand what
you're staying. Hello?

965
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:47,476
Colonel, I think that's you, we are in
France, a couple of hours from evreux.

966
00:55:47,478 --> 00:55:53,415
I can't hear you. Listen there
has been a change of plan.

967
00:55:53,417 --> 00:55:58,721
Paris is unsafe. Don't go to paris.
Storm coming.

968
00:55:58,723 --> 00:56:01,724
Hello? Colonel dillard?

969
00:56:01,726 --> 00:56:06,328
[call breaking up] the kids...
Are directly ... Danger...

970
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:13,402
Now, I will arrange to have
the kids picked up. [static]

971
00:56:13,404 --> 00:56:19,308
If you can get to evreux,
[static] the helicopter...

972
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:25,948
I can't, something about a storm and the
kids and evreux, and... I don't know.

973
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:28,684
Look, I hope you understand this
message.

974
00:56:28,686 --> 00:56:31,687
Colonel, can you hear me? Can
you repeat?

975
00:56:31,689 --> 00:56:38,093
Can't understand a word you're saying.
Got to go now. [static] god bless.

976
00:56:38,095 --> 00:56:40,195
Uhhh lost the signal.

977
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:43,432
Now what?

978
00:56:43,434 --> 00:56:45,701
We'll have to just stick to the
plan that's all we can do.

979
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:52,174
This part of the city seems
quiet.

980
00:56:52,176 --> 00:56:54,309
It must have been evacuated
already.

981
00:56:54,311 --> 00:56:55,177
Hey.

982
00:56:55,179 --> 00:56:58,380
There's gotta be an unlocked
door somewhere around here.

983
00:56:58,382 --> 00:57:02,718
If we can get inside someplace, preferably
someplace with food and power we outta be

984
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,887
Safe and warm until it's time
to meet up with dad and lacey.

985
00:57:04,889 --> 00:57:07,990
Ok, breaking and entering,
great plan ryan, great.

986
00:57:07,992 --> 00:57:10,259
You wanna be law abiding
or you wanna be warm?

987
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:16,698
Come on, come on come on.

988
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:18,634
Damn he saw us.

989
00:57:18,636 --> 00:57:20,736
Where are we gonna go.

990
00:57:20,738 --> 00:57:22,971
[shouting in french]

991
00:57:22,973 --> 00:57:26,375
We can't run. He'd follow, probably call
others, we'd just get further away from the

992
00:57:26,377 --> 00:57:29,645
Tower, uh, maybe we
can reason with him?

993
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:33,382
[shouting in french]

994
00:57:33,384 --> 00:57:37,719
He doesn't sound too reasonable,

995
00:57:37,721 --> 00:57:39,021
[gasp]

996
00:57:39,023 --> 00:57:41,657
He doesn't look that reasonable
either.

997
00:57:41,659 --> 00:57:44,526
Look ryan, we don't know this guy, we
don't know where he would take us.

998
00:57:44,528 --> 00:57:48,130
Dad is risking everything to be at the
tower, we need to be there when he arrives.

999
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:50,232
You're right c'mon!.

1000
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:58,140
Alright easy, easy, look
we don't mean any harm.

1001
00:57:58,142 --> 00:58:00,242
American?

1002
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:06,582
[beeping]

1003
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:13,689
You need to come with me. Everyone
is being evacuated. We have shelter

1004
00:58:13,691 --> 00:58:15,824
Outside the city with food
and medical supplies.

1005
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:18,260
No we can't do that we're meeting
our parents at the eiffel tower.

1006
00:58:18,262 --> 00:58:21,730
No no, you come with me. Your parents
are probably in the shelter already.

1007
00:58:21,732 --> 00:58:24,166
No, no, no. You don't
understand our parents...

1008
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:25,707
No you don't understand.
A national disaster

1009
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,269
has occurred. We need
to get everyone to

1010
00:58:27,271 --> 00:58:28,971
A place of safety.

1011
00:58:28,973 --> 00:58:30,506
Safety? Where? This isn't just
some storm, don't you get it?

1012
00:58:32,742 --> 00:58:36,478
I am not asking. Come with me
now.

1013
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,746
Look we can't we're sorry.

1014
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:40,015
[gun shot]

1015
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:44,820
I have my order and now you have yours.
You come with me for your own safety.

1016
00:58:44,822 --> 00:58:49,057
Alright alright just don't
shoot us for our own safety.

1017
00:58:49,059 --> 00:58:50,626
Get back, get in.

1018
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:10,178
Hey. [speaking french]

1019
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:11,613
Angelique.

1020
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:15,417
Really?

1021
00:59:20,123 --> 00:59:21,256
How much further?

1022
00:59:21,258 --> 00:59:23,091
Ten or twelve miles.

1023
00:59:23,093 --> 00:59:24,092
Are we good on gas?

1024
00:59:24,094 --> 00:59:26,728
Oh yeah we're doing great.

1025
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:29,231
Alrighty then. Nap time.

1026
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:39,408
Whoa, you alright?!

1027
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:42,678
That wind came out of nowhere -
must be 60/70 miles an hour!

1028
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:48,183
Well what can we do?

1029
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:52,487
We might have to pull
over until it passes.

1030
00:59:52,489 --> 00:59:53,755
Can we spare the time?

1031
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:58,226
Not really but... We
might not have a choice.

1032
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:04,232
Argh, argh.

1033
01:00:04,234 --> 01:00:06,535
Oh steve!

1034
01:00:06,537 --> 01:00:12,841
Hold on!

1035
01:00:12,843 --> 01:00:13,675
You alright?

1036
01:00:13,677 --> 01:00:14,843
Yeah. You?

1037
01:00:14,845 --> 01:00:18,880
Yeah. Yeah... Ok.

1038
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:21,183
[engine stall]

1039
01:00:21,185 --> 01:00:22,918
Oh come on.

1040
01:00:23,886 --> 01:00:27,089
[heavy breathing] looks like
we're on foot from here soldier.

1041
01:00:27,091 --> 01:00:28,824
Oh foot?

1042
01:00:28,826 --> 01:00:33,195
[laughs] yeah. It's alright.
It's only a couple miles.

1043
01:00:33,197 --> 01:00:33,895
Ha, a couple miles.

1044
01:00:33,897 --> 01:00:35,030
Yeah.

1045
01:00:35,032 --> 01:00:36,865
How are we gonna find the base?

1046
01:00:36,867 --> 01:00:40,235
It's fine. I have all the
coordinates in the gps on my watch.

1047
01:00:40,503 --> 01:00:41,903
Ready for a little hike soldier?

1048
01:00:41,905 --> 01:00:43,005
Sure.

1049
01:00:43,007 --> 01:00:44,239
Come on. Let's get the gear.

1050
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:01,556
There you go,

1051
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:13,468
Southwest. This way.

1052
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:22,978
You will see. The shelter is probably
the best place for you to be.

1053
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:25,514
Most likely your parents are
already there waiting for you.

1054
01:01:25,516 --> 01:01:27,121
Sir, we know you're just
trying to do your job

1055
01:01:27,134 --> 01:01:28,750
but we really need to
get to the tower, ok.

1056
01:01:28,752 --> 01:01:30,986
Our parents are coming
in from out of town.

1057
01:01:30,988 --> 01:01:32,176
No one is coming in from
out of town, mister.

1058
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:33,388
Of that I can assure you.

1059
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:36,214
Our dad is an air force pilot.
Or use to be.

1060
01:01:36,227 --> 01:01:39,061
And is sending a
helicopter to pick us up.

1061
01:01:39,063 --> 01:01:40,529
You need to let us go.

1062
01:01:40,531 --> 01:01:42,097
I am sorry mad' masel but...

1063
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:43,432
Look out!

1064
01:01:46,736 --> 01:01:47,936
Oh my god.

1065
01:01:51,307 --> 01:01:52,774
Everyone alright?

1066
01:01:52,776 --> 01:01:54,710
Yeah I'm fine.

1067
01:01:56,312 --> 01:01:57,379
Is he alright?

1068
01:01:57,613 --> 01:01:58,847
I don't think so.

1069
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:00,982
Hey!

1070
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:04,986
Oh my god, we're stuck!

1071
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,255
He's got them on safety lock.

1072
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:10,859
Do you smell that?

1073
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,328
Gasoline.

1074
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:16,565
Oh my god, it's leaking!

1075
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:28,477
Quick, we gotta get out of here.

1076
01:02:28,479 --> 01:02:30,312
Come on. Come on!

1077
01:02:45,194 --> 01:02:46,762
What about her?

1078
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:54,636
[explosion]

1079
01:02:55,638 --> 01:02:57,706
[speaking french]
you ok?

1080
01:02:59,008 --> 01:03:00,776
I'm a little dizzy.

1081
01:03:03,412 --> 01:03:04,679
Hey.
Hey.

1082
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:17,392
We need to get out of here.

1083
01:03:17,394 --> 01:03:18,660
Where?

1084
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:22,264
The eiffel tower.
The eiffel tower.

1085
01:03:22,266 --> 01:03:31,406
[speaking french]

1086
01:03:31,408 --> 01:03:34,409
Short cut. Come come.

1087
01:03:59,969 --> 01:04:02,771
Can we rest for a second, it's
been hours.

1088
01:04:02,773 --> 01:04:05,340
C'mon honey we gotta keep moving, we
gotta keep the blood circulating.

1089
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:08,443
My legs are on fire, but the
rest of me's numb with cold.

1090
01:04:08,445 --> 01:04:10,545
We gotta keep movin honey c'mon.

1091
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:15,617
Oh!

1092
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:19,454
Here, lacey

1093
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:41,710
[breathing]

1094
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:49,484
We're here!

1095
01:04:49,486 --> 01:04:51,620
What really, oh I can't believe
it.

1096
01:04:51,622 --> 01:04:52,954
And still on schedule!

1097
01:04:52,956 --> 01:04:55,023
Don't jinx it, cmon.

1098
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:01,997
Steve! Steve!

1099
01:05:01,999 --> 01:05:02,998
Lacey!

1100
01:05:20,216 --> 01:05:21,616
Well, it beats walking.

1101
01:05:21,618 --> 01:05:22,584
You alright?

1102
01:05:22,586 --> 01:05:23,952
[laughs]
yeah

1103
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:30,258
It's creepy, there's nobody
here.

1104
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:32,227
Let's hope someone's still here.

1105
01:05:32,229 --> 01:05:34,129
Hello!

1106
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:35,597
Hello!

1107
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:37,632
Anybody here?!

1108
01:05:37,634 --> 01:05:39,901
Colonel dillard sent us!

1109
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:43,071

1110
01:05:43,073 --> 01:05:44,139

C'mon, get in!

1112
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:53,548
Lieutenant carl redding
sir, glad you made it.

1113
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:55,250
Thank you lt. This is my wife
lacey.

1114
01:05:55,252 --> 01:05:57,185
Well now that you're here why
don't we get the hell out?

1115
01:05:57,187 --> 01:05:59,788
Good idea, I'll get the
doors and you start her up!

1116
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:01,756
Well actually, I heard you're a
hell of a pilot, why I don't I

1117
01:06:01,758 --> 01:06:03,191
Get these doors and
you fire it up!

1118
01:06:03,193 --> 01:06:04,626
You got it!

1119
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,070
Main rotter.

1120
01:06:15,072 --> 01:06:16,004
Clear

1121
01:06:16,006 --> 01:06:16,771
Throttle.

1122
01:06:16,773 --> 01:06:17,839
Open

1123
01:06:17,841 --> 01:06:18,473
Starter.

1124
01:06:18,475 --> 01:06:19,741
Engaging

1125
01:06:21,577 --> 01:06:23,845
Oil pressure 10% n1, I should go
help him.

1126
01:06:30,019 --> 01:06:30,952
Thanks.

1127
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:46,234
Main rotter?

1128
01:06:46,236 --> 01:06:48,169
Turning by 25%.

1129
01:06:48,171 --> 01:06:49,237
Starter.

1130
01:06:49,239 --> 01:06:50,939
Ignition at 58%.

1131
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,513
Oh! I'm ok.

1132
01:06:58,515 --> 01:06:59,781
He needs my help again.

1133
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:03,151
[scream]

1134
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:22,771
We need to make up for lost
time.

1135
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:02,844
Oh. Good job.

1136
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:13,688
How long until dad and lacey get
here?

1137
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:16,758
Honestly it could be any time. They
still have to get the helicopter.

1138
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:19,594
I really hope we don't
miss them at the tower.

1139
01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:21,463
That would really suck.

1140
01:08:21,465 --> 01:08:23,398
We're not gonna miss them.
We are making good time.

1141
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:27,335
Ok, well we don't need any
distractions.

1142
01:08:27,903 --> 01:08:30,071
She's the one that knew
where the tunnel was.

1143
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:32,807
Geez, we couldn't have left her back there.
That would be like murder.

1144
01:08:32,809 --> 01:08:34,776
It's getting worse
by the minute.

1145
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:36,277
Stop!

1146
01:08:37,179 --> 01:08:38,179
Nice bike.

1147
01:08:39,682 --> 01:08:40,882
We'll take that.

1148
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:42,183
You can't take our-

1149
01:08:42,185 --> 01:08:43,218
[bang]

1150
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:46,221
No body said you could speak.

1151
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:48,156
Understand?

1152
01:08:49,391 --> 01:08:50,959
Yeah. I understand.

1153
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:55,730
Good. So ... We'll take the
bikes.

1154
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:01,669
And the coats too.

1155
01:09:01,871 --> 01:09:04,739
What? You can't take the -
[groan]

1156
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:06,641
Ryan.

1157
01:09:06,842 --> 01:09:08,810
The coats! Now!

1158
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:11,012
Lady.

1159
01:09:16,252 --> 01:09:17,819
Ryan.

1160
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:28,385
Don't look so sad. You're
lucky you keep your shoes.

1161
01:09:28,398 --> 01:09:32,233
Or should I take them too?

1162
01:09:32,235 --> 01:09:34,269
No please.

1163
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:37,205
Kidding.

1164
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:40,942
Take off.

1165
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:47,081
[banging on ground]

1166
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:05,567
Noooo.

1167
01:10:05,569 --> 01:10:07,669
Man, not another earthquake.

1168
01:10:07,671 --> 01:10:09,571
Oh, this is getting' old.

1169
01:10:09,573 --> 01:10:10,838
C'mon.

1170
01:10:13,242 --> 01:10:14,275
Ce que se pasee?!

1171
01:10:14,277 --> 01:10:16,644
I don't know! The water in the
pipes?

1172
01:10:16,646 --> 01:10:19,414
The water...It's freezing, it's
causing the pipes to burst.

1173
01:10:19,416 --> 01:10:20,481
Let's go.

1174
01:10:22,818 --> 01:10:25,253
[scream]

1175
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:29,424
Hey!

1176
01:10:29,426 --> 01:10:30,058
Taryn?

1177
01:10:31,293 --> 01:10:32,360
You ok?

1178
01:10:41,604 --> 01:10:43,504
Ryan!

1179
01:10:47,276 --> 01:10:48,343
Oh my god.

1180
01:10:57,152 --> 01:10:58,720
Damn it, it's locked.

1181
01:10:58,722 --> 01:11:00,822
I'm gonna try the stairs let's
go.

1182
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:21,976
This is really bad.

1183
01:11:21,978 --> 01:11:24,245
I've never seen anything
like this berfore.

1184
01:11:26,015 --> 01:11:27,915
Can we get above it?

1185
01:11:27,917 --> 01:11:31,486
I'm worried about navigation. Half
the instruments are out as it is.

1186
01:11:31,754 --> 01:11:33,254
But it's worth a try.

1187
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:41,195
Oh wow. We gotta get over that.

1188
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:44,899
Uh oh.

1189
01:11:44,901 --> 01:11:47,068
Don't say uh oh. No uh oh.

1190
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:48,536
Main rotter warning.

1191
01:11:48,538 --> 01:11:49,937
What?

1192
01:11:49,939 --> 01:11:53,074
Dammit. Engine stall. Must be
the ash.

1193
01:11:53,076 --> 01:11:54,042
Are we gonna crash?

1194
01:11:54,044 --> 01:11:55,476
Not if I can help it.

1195
01:12:02,117 --> 01:12:03,685
We're falling.

1196
01:12:03,687 --> 01:12:04,752
Honey, I got it under control.

1197
01:12:04,754 --> 01:12:06,854
We're falling.

1198
01:12:06,856 --> 01:12:08,790
Honey, I got it under control. I've
trained for this exact scenario, alright?

1199
01:12:08,792 --> 01:12:11,693
It's called an auto rotation.
We keep the rotter angled.

1200
01:12:11,695 --> 01:12:14,729
The blades spinning. We'll have a
controlled decent. Understand?

1201
01:12:14,897 --> 01:12:16,297
Yeah. I think so.

1202
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:19,033
Just got to give the
engine time to recover.

1203
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:24,806
Are we gonna land?

1204
01:12:24,808 --> 01:12:26,140
We might have to.

1205
01:12:26,142 --> 01:12:27,075
Are we gonna crash?

1206
01:12:27,077 --> 01:12:28,276
We might have too.

1207
01:12:28,278 --> 01:12:28,976
Steve.

1208
01:12:28,978 --> 01:12:30,144
Honey, it's ok.

1209
01:12:30,713 --> 01:12:32,413
Steve!

1210
01:12:32,415 --> 01:12:34,282
I'll try one more time. Just
give the engine time to kick in.

1211
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:45,727
Are we dead?

1212
01:12:45,729 --> 01:12:47,061
I don't think so.

1213
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:50,264
Did we crash?

1214
01:12:50,266 --> 01:12:52,066
[laughs]
I don't think so.

1215
01:12:52,334 --> 01:12:53,935
[sigh]
are we going to be ok?

1216
01:12:53,937 --> 01:12:56,371
I think so honey.

1217
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:58,840
Next time we'll take a cruise.

1218
01:12:58,842 --> 01:13:01,109
You got a deal.

1219
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:06,214
They did say they were coming
in a helicopter, right?

1220
01:13:06,216 --> 01:13:08,216
Where are they going to land?

1221
01:13:08,218 --> 01:13:09,751
Not down there.

1222
01:13:09,753 --> 01:13:12,253
Yeah and not here. Ryan,
what are we gonna do?

1223
01:13:12,255 --> 01:13:13,861
Maybe, maybe if we can
find a way to get to

1224
01:13:13,874 --> 01:13:15,490
the top they can drop a
rope ladder or we can

1225
01:13:15,492 --> 01:13:21,829
Find a way to climb on
board -- I don't know!

1226
01:13:21,831 --> 01:13:23,297
You don't know?

1227
01:13:23,299 --> 01:13:26,134
After all this we're just gonna
die here?

1228
01:13:26,136 --> 01:13:28,269
We would have been better
off in a refugee camp ryan.

1229
01:13:28,271 --> 01:13:30,194
You know dad he's
like freakin captain

1230
01:13:30,207 --> 01:13:32,140
america, if anyone can
pull this off he can.

1231
01:13:32,142 --> 01:13:36,477
You still believe that, after all
this, why do you idolize him so much?

1232
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:39,981
Because he's a hero! And I'd be
lucky to be half the man he is.

1233
01:13:39,983 --> 01:13:46,687
Well, he'd better not be late,
otherwise he's grounded, for life.

1234
01:13:46,689 --> 01:13:49,957
C'mon, a thousand more
steps.

1235
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:15,249
[breathing]
oh, ohhhh.

1236
01:14:15,251 --> 01:14:17,452
I don't like the sound of that.

1237
01:14:17,454 --> 01:14:21,923
C'mon t. This thing has been standing
since 1889, it's not gonna fall over now.

1238
01:14:21,925 --> 01:14:23,991
But it wasn't built to last.

1239
01:14:23,993 --> 01:14:26,093
Have a little faith c'mon!

1240
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:33,801
You ok?

1241
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:35,770
Yeah you ok?

1242
01:14:35,772 --> 01:14:37,672
Let's keep going.

1243
01:14:53,622 --> 01:14:59,293
[rumbling]

1244
01:14:59,295 --> 01:15:01,929
Ok, maybe we should head back
down.

1245
01:15:01,931 --> 01:15:05,867
Yeah.

1246
01:15:05,869 --> 01:15:08,135
Okay, let's keep moving!

1247
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:19,080
Paris. Where's the tower?

1248
01:15:19,082 --> 01:15:22,517
We would be able to see it if it wasn't for
all these storm clouds and all these ashes.

1249
01:15:24,219 --> 01:15:25,520
Oh, there it is.

1250
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:28,256
Steve.

1251
01:15:28,258 --> 01:15:30,992
Let's just get there
1st and find the kids.

1252
01:15:31,393 --> 01:15:32,693
One crisis at a time.

1253
01:15:34,563 --> 01:15:37,632
[screaming]

1254
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:42,069
Hey it's them.

1255
01:15:42,071 --> 01:15:43,237
Really?

1256
01:15:43,239 --> 01:15:44,138
I don't know it's a helicopter!

1257
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:49,076
Hey hey, over here.

1258
01:15:49,078 --> 01:15:50,878
Come on kids, where are you?

1259
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,547
Do you see them?

1260
01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:54,882
Dad.
Dad.

1261
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:57,351
[scream]

1262
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:59,387
Maybe they are underneath it?

1263
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:02,056
Maybe, but it could be
unstable down there.

1264
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:06,827
Hey hey, over here.

1265
01:16:06,829 --> 01:16:09,830
Oh there steve, ryan ryan!

1266
01:16:09,832 --> 01:16:11,766
There is no way he can here you
baby.

1267
01:16:17,806 --> 01:16:18,873
Oh thank god!

1268
01:16:20,342 --> 01:16:21,809
Incredible right?!

1269
01:16:21,811 --> 01:16:26,180
Hey hey, hey!

1270
01:16:26,182 --> 01:16:27,448
What the?

1271
01:16:30,352 --> 01:16:32,720
Hurry hurry!

1272
01:16:32,722 --> 01:16:35,656
I see it but I don't know
what the hell it is.

1273
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:37,892
May be this is what dillard
was talking about.

1274
01:16:37,894 --> 01:16:39,293
May be.

1275
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:41,395
All we can do is get there
before it does.

1276
01:16:43,665 --> 01:16:45,299
Read my mind.

1277
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:50,504
Ryan, if we don't make it out of
here, I just want you to know.

1278
01:16:50,506 --> 01:16:52,540
Yeah yeah yeah no I love you too
t.

1279
01:16:52,542 --> 01:16:57,311
No no no I mean I love
you but I quit school.

1280
01:16:57,313 --> 01:16:59,380
What?! When?!

1281
01:16:59,382 --> 01:17:02,450
A couple months ago, I didn't
want you to be disappointed in me

1282
01:17:02,452 --> 01:17:05,353
You're so much like
dad, in a good way.

1283
01:17:06,021 --> 01:17:08,489
Hopefully that will be the
worst news I get today.

1284
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:34,749
Dammit. I missed it.

1285
01:17:34,751 --> 01:17:35,883
Try again.

1286
01:17:53,135 --> 01:17:54,902
It's alright try again.

1287
01:18:05,147 --> 01:18:06,847
Can you get any closer?

1288
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:11,252
I'm trying. What if the wind
slams us right into that thing.

1289
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:25,166
T you ok?

1290
01:18:25,168 --> 01:18:27,435
That freakin' hurt.

1291
01:18:27,437 --> 01:18:29,036
I don't like this anymore ryan.

1292
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:31,305
Me either let's get outta here.

1293
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:47,688
They got it.

1294
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:48,789
Hurry.

1295
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:56,731
Now what? They can't climb this
thing.

1296
01:18:56,733 --> 01:18:59,900
It's alright. We'll have to
slide.

1297
01:19:03,705 --> 01:19:05,973
We need a hook or a rod or
something.

1298
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:08,342
I'm on it!

1299
01:19:26,394 --> 01:19:30,397
You're ok? Ready, go!

1300
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:32,032
Ok get ready.

1301
01:19:39,474 --> 01:19:40,608
You ready t?

1302
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:43,077
You got this. You got this. Go

1303
01:19:44,012 --> 01:19:46,447
[screams]

1304
01:19:59,094 --> 01:20:00,294
Everybody alright?

1305
01:20:00,296 --> 01:20:01,862
Yeah.

1306
01:20:02,264 --> 01:20:03,497
Cut that line.

1307
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:25,986
Hold on!

1308
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:45,339
What was that?

1309
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:46,874
We got hit.

1310
01:20:46,876 --> 01:20:48,509
How bad is it?

1311
01:20:48,511 --> 01:20:51,478
It's not good. We got 100 miles to go.
Only an hour to get there.

1312
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:52,880
Are we gonna make it?

1313
01:20:52,882 --> 01:20:55,950
We'll find out soon enough.

1314
01:21:06,795 --> 01:21:08,696
Cornel how come we don't
leave if everyone is here?

1315
01:21:08,698 --> 01:21:10,965
Because not everyone is here.

1316
01:21:10,967 --> 01:21:15,069
You're willing to risk all of our lives for
people who may or may not make it on time?

1317
01:21:15,071 --> 01:21:17,905
The storm is only getting worse.
We should leave this minute.

1318
01:21:17,907 --> 01:21:20,975
Who the hell are they anyway.
We should get out of here.

1319
01:21:20,977 --> 01:21:25,579
The plane leaves on time.
Not a second before.

1320
01:21:29,517 --> 01:21:31,785
Make final preparations for take
off.

1321
01:21:56,845 --> 01:22:02,116
Come on. Come on. Just 10 miles.
We can make it. We can make it.

1322
01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:10,057
All set sir. Departure on your
command.

1323
01:22:10,059 --> 01:22:11,692
Very well.

1324
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:15,362
There's the base.

1325
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:17,264
I think we are going to be ok.

1326
01:22:17,565 --> 01:22:18,966
Don't jinx it.

1327
01:22:19,467 --> 01:22:21,302
Don't be superstitious honey.

1328
01:22:21,536 --> 01:22:23,237
[explosion]

1329
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:28,142
Dad!

1330
01:22:28,343 --> 01:22:30,711
Hold on. We're going down.

1331
01:22:34,215 --> 01:22:37,151
Let's just hope the snow
is as soft as it looks.

1332
01:22:37,419 --> 01:22:38,652
I love you daddy.

1333
01:22:38,887 --> 01:22:41,622
I love you too baby. Hold on.

1334
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:55,636
Wait a minute. There they are.

1335
01:22:55,638 --> 01:22:58,739
Everybody hang on! This is it!

1336
01:23:06,715 --> 01:23:08,248
Looks like they didn't make it
sir.

1337
01:23:08,917 --> 01:23:10,417
Well we better check it out.

1338
01:23:10,419 --> 01:23:12,119
Sir.

1339
01:23:12,121 --> 01:23:16,256
Listen man. If half and hour
is gonna save the life of that

1340
01:23:16,258 --> 01:23:17,758
Family that's what
I'm going to do.

1341
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:20,995
Sir. You have 25 minutes
exactly.

1342
01:23:20,997 --> 01:23:22,997
Captain.

1343
01:23:22,999 --> 01:23:24,688
Cornel dillard, you know
where I got my orders.

1344
01:23:24,701 --> 01:23:26,400
Look, I wish you got speed sir.
But

1345
01:23:26,402 --> 01:23:29,770
In 26 minutes we will be airborne
with or without you sir.

1346
01:23:29,772 --> 01:23:32,239
You'll do what you have to do
captain.

1347
01:23:32,241 --> 01:23:37,778
But just bet in mind, that could
be your family out there.

1348
01:23:39,748 --> 01:23:41,915
Right. I need volunteers.

1349
01:23:43,818 --> 01:23:45,753
Good lads. Come on.

1350
01:23:50,959 --> 01:23:51,759
Hold it.

1351
01:23:55,730 --> 01:23:57,564
Alright. Double time.

1352
01:24:08,843 --> 01:24:09,977
Anyone alive?

1353
01:24:09,979 --> 01:24:10,944
[steve]
ralph is that you?

1354
01:24:10,946 --> 01:24:12,346
Quick! Get them out.

1355
01:24:12,514 --> 01:24:13,947
Steve hang on.

1356
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:17,351
Get it outta the way.

1357
01:24:23,825 --> 01:24:24,992
You alright?

1358
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:31,098
[laugh]
sorry I'm late buddy.

1359
01:24:33,768 --> 01:24:34,802
I see your flying had improved.

1360
01:24:34,804 --> 01:24:36,036
I learned from the best sir.

1361
01:24:36,038 --> 01:24:38,072
You can't count either.

1362
01:24:38,873 --> 01:24:40,274
She's with me. You got room
don't you?

1363
01:24:40,276 --> 01:24:42,142
