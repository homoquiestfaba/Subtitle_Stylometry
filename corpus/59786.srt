1
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:44,387
<i>Australia...</i>

2
00:00:44,661 --> 00:00:46,288
<i>..."The Land Down Under. "</i>

3
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:47,854
<i>Rugged...</i>

4
00:00:48,498 --> 00:00:49,487
<i>... remote...</i>

5
00:00:50,066 --> 00:00:52,057
<i>... inhospitable and dangerous.</i>

6
00:00:52,335 --> 00:00:54,895
<i>Home to 20 million kangaroos.</i>

7
00:00:55,071 --> 00:00:59,804
<i>But there is one who is more elusive</i>
<i>and clever than all the rest.</i>

8
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,511
<i>And his name is Kangaroo Jack.</i>

9
00:01:05,548 --> 00:01:08,016
<i>But my story doesn't begin in Australia.</i>

10
00:01:09,853 --> 00:01:13,380
<i>It begins 20 years ago, halfway around</i>
<i>the world on a beach in Brooklyn.</i>

11
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,152
<i>That's me...</i>

12
00:01:15,592 --> 00:01:16,957
<i>... Charlie Carbone.</i>

13
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,096
<i>Three things happened on this day</i>
<i>that would change my life.</i>

14
00:01:21,264 --> 00:01:23,630
<i>First, was that my mom met Sal.</i>

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,801
<i>She hadn't dated much since Dad died, but</i>
<i>I could tell right away she was interested.</i>

16
00:01:28,972 --> 00:01:33,432
<i>Why shouldn't she be? Sal Maggio was a</i>
<i>respected member of the community.</i>

17
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,544
<i>Well, feared and respected.</i>

18
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,569
<i>Well, feared.</i>

19
00:01:37,747 --> 00:01:39,647
<i>And that's Frankie Lombardo.</i>

20
00:01:39,816 --> 00:01:43,513
<i>Fresh out of Juvenile Hall,</i>
<i>where they named a wing after him.</i>

21
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:46,484
<i>Sal was grooming Frankie</i>
<i>to take over the family business...</i>

22
00:01:46,656 --> 00:01:48,988
<i>... a family I was about to become a part of.</i>

23
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,924
<i>The second thing that happened</i>
<i>was that I met Louis Booker.</i>

24
00:01:58,568 --> 00:02:03,028
Don't tell me.
You got 75 cents in your back pocket.

25
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:06,004
You're wrong.
It's a Captain Amazing compass.

26
00:02:06,943 --> 00:02:10,936
- How much you want for it?
- It's not for sale. No way. Sorry.

27
00:02:11,314 --> 00:02:13,646
- Wanna play some ball?
- No. You play ball.

28
00:02:13,817 --> 00:02:17,218
I gotta check this entire beach
if I'm gonna make my car payment.

29
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,020
- You've got a car?
- No, but I will.

30
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,024
Now, step aside. My uncle only rented me
this metal detector for the day.

31
00:02:24,194 --> 00:02:25,559
- <i>And the third...</i>
- Hey, kid.

32
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,889
<i>... most important thing</i>
<i>that happened that day...</i>

33
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,053
Go long.

34
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,462
<i>... was that I went out for a 20</i>- <i>yard pass.</i>

35
00:02:31,835 --> 00:02:35,202
<i>Unfortunately, there was only 15 yards</i>
<i>worth of beach...</i>

36
00:02:36,339 --> 00:02:40,298
<i>... and a really strong undertow.</i>
<i>And I couldn't swim.</i>

37
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,108
Hey, kid! You lost your...

38
00:02:55,358 --> 00:02:58,020
Somebody help! I think there's
a kid drowning out...

39
00:02:58,361 --> 00:02:59,623
I'll save you!

40
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,406
<i>That one moment changed my life...</i>

41
00:03:13,877 --> 00:03:16,038
<i>... because in all the years that followed...</i>

42
00:03:16,246 --> 00:03:19,682
<i>... Louis was better at getting</i>
<i>me into trouble than getting me out.</i>

43
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:23,181
<i>A dreamer in search of treasure,</i>
<i>who only found bottle caps.</i>

44
00:03:23,353 --> 00:03:25,514
<i>On that fateful day, Louis saved my life.</i>

45
00:03:25,722 --> 00:03:26,711
You see this guy?

46
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,050
<i>And I never forgot it.</i>

47
00:03:28,191 --> 00:03:29,180
He just saved your life.

48
00:03:29,993 --> 00:03:31,255
<i>He wouldn't let me.</i>

49
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,092
<i>And now it's 20 years later.</i>

50
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:37,797
<i>My new stepfather, Sal,</i>
<i>set me up in my own business:</i>

51
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,935
<i>A beauty salon.</i>
<i>He did it for my mother.</i>

52
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:44,529
<i>Of course, his goons come in every week</i>
<i>and take 80 percent of the profits.</i>

53
00:03:44,707 --> 00:03:45,969
<i>That, he did for himself.</i>

54
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,404
Hey, Carbone.

55
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:52,172
<i>And Louis, the guy who saved my life,</i>
<i>is now my closest friend.</i>

56
00:03:52,348 --> 00:03:54,680
<i>He thinks I can do a lot better than this...</i>

57
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:57,649
<i>... but he also thinks he looks like</i>
<i>Denzel Washington.</i>

58
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,551
Toots, I was hoping you could ask Sal
if I could keep a little extra this week...

59
00:04:01,724 --> 00:04:03,453
...to make improvements on the place.

60
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:07,221
You wanna make improvements?
Lmprove on what's in this bag next week.

61
00:04:08,698 --> 00:04:09,858
Look, man, I need a favor.

62
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:12,797
I just got this job delivering TVs,
but my partner got sick.

63
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,970
He had one of those
microwave chimichangas...

64
00:04:15,138 --> 00:04:17,402
Louis, why do all your stories
start off this way?

65
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:21,304
I need your help. If I don't get these TVs
off the truck, man, I don't get paid.

66
00:04:21,744 --> 00:04:22,972
Oh, this sounds illegal.

67
00:04:23,246 --> 00:04:26,807
No, no, no. Charlie, this is totally legit, man.
I know the guy.

68
00:04:26,983 --> 00:04:28,348
Just like you knew the guy...

69
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,681
...who asked you to drive
his dogs up from Florida. Remember him?

70
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:35,550
I'm supposed to know a bunch of greyhounds
were being used to smuggle diamonds?

71
00:04:36,893 --> 00:04:40,886
Look, man, I need your help on this one.
Two hours, tops. That's all I need.

72
00:04:41,064 --> 00:04:44,591
- This is really important for me.
- Louis, you have a job.

73
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:47,961
You call working in my uncle's
meat market a job, Charlie?

74
00:04:48,137 --> 00:04:50,833
I sweep up cow guts and
pig snouts all day, man!

75
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:52,975
I need a job where I'm treated like a man.

76
00:04:53,142 --> 00:04:56,407
Where I get some respect. Ain't
that what Aretha said? "R-E-S-P-E-C-T"?

77
00:04:56,612 --> 00:04:59,479
Well, then, delivering TVs
is definitely the answer.

78
00:04:59,983 --> 00:05:03,111
I'm dying here, man. I need your help.

79
00:05:04,153 --> 00:05:06,417
Louis, I'm busy here.
Can't you see I'm busy?

80
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:09,183
I was busy that day 20 years ago
on the beach too, man.

81
00:05:09,492 --> 00:05:13,223
Did that stop me from saving this skinny
little white kid from flailing in the surf?

82
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:17,332
No, I stopped what I was doing, jumped
in and saved this poor little white kid.

83
00:05:18,434 --> 00:05:19,696
Let's go.

84
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,393
You too easy.

85
00:05:24,474 --> 00:05:25,566
Hey there, Waffles.

86
00:05:25,842 --> 00:05:27,469
Got a kiss for your Uncle Charlie?

87
00:05:28,978 --> 00:05:30,570
Come on, man, what's wrong?

88
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,044
It's just so frustrating.

89
00:05:32,215 --> 00:05:34,615
You don't know how difficult it is
to get anywhere...

90
00:05:34,784 --> 00:05:37,753
...when Sal is your stepfather.
- He bought you the beauty salon.

91
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,911
I barely keep enough to stay alive.

92
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,887
If he was my stepdaddy,
you know what I'd be doing right now?

93
00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:45,789
I'd be:
Come on, Charlie, break it down with me.

94
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:48,526
Snake it. Come on, snake it...

95
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,923
It be a party, Charlie. Be a party.

96
00:05:53,503 --> 00:05:54,936
<i>Pull over to the curb.</i>

97
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,163
Louis, whose truck is this?

98
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,932
I can't be certain.

99
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,666
<i>This is a stolen vehicle.</i>

100
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:04,008
- Apparently, this is a stolen vehicle.
- Oh, my God.

101
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,306
Pull over to the curb.

102
00:06:05,748 --> 00:06:07,579
<i>Pull over to the curb!</i>

103
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:12,219
Louis, pull the truck over.
Just tell them the truth!

104
00:06:12,388 --> 00:06:13,980
- Pull the truck over!
- I can't, man!

105
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,520
I'm still on probation from
that greyhound thing.

106
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,149
Come on, Louis.

107
00:06:19,162 --> 00:06:21,187
Watch out! Here we go! Okay!

108
00:06:21,364 --> 00:06:23,161
You're breaking so many laws right now!

109
00:06:23,332 --> 00:06:26,096
If we go to jail, I'll tell
everybody you a hairdresser!

110
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:28,964
Sidewalk, Louis! Sidewalk!

111
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:31,806
Look out! Are you crazy!?

112
00:06:32,108 --> 00:06:33,575
Sorry! Excuse me!

113
00:06:33,743 --> 00:06:34,971
Red light!

114
00:06:47,623 --> 00:06:48,647
That wasn't my fault!

115
00:06:51,928 --> 00:06:53,555
That was my fault.

116
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:56,162
Coming through!

117
00:07:06,976 --> 00:07:08,341
Charlie.

118
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,170
Almost ripped my lucky jacket.

119
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:15,078
What a relief. I forgot
you were wearing your lucky jacket!

120
00:07:21,924 --> 00:07:24,392
Big problem: Roadblock!

121
00:07:25,628 --> 00:07:27,186
Bigger problem!

122
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,162
Oh, no.

123
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:33,262
What're you doing? Slow down!

124
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,764
- We're gonna make it. Hold on!
- We're not gonna make it!

125
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:49,014
Now, that's what I'm talking about!
That's what I'm talking about!

126
00:07:49,185 --> 00:07:52,814
I think the dog just peed on my leg.
No, I think I peed on him.

127
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:56,254
<i>All units, intersection blocked.</i>
<i>Suspects are at large.</i>

128
00:07:56,526 --> 00:07:59,893
- Just pull the truck over, I am getting out.
- You can't bail on me now!

129
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,530
I gotta stash these TVs
until the heat cools down.

130
00:08:02,698 --> 00:08:05,292
Come on. We got six TVs left.

131
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:08,865
Five. Come on, man, help me get this up.

132
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:11,964
Hey. Is that Charlie?

133
00:08:12,675 --> 00:08:14,905
- Tommy?
- What're you guys doing here?

134
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,944
- Your father didn't say you was coming.
- Sal?

135
00:08:18,114 --> 00:08:20,309
Yeah, this is his warehouse.

136
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,141
- I didn't know.
- You didn't know?

137
00:08:22,318 --> 00:08:23,376
I didn't know!

138
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,578
Hey!

139
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,913
You brung the heat here, Charlie.
Are you crazy?

140
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,184
I didn't know, Tommy!
I swear, I didn't know!

141
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:39,865
Waffles, come on!

142
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,230
- Oh, damn!
- <i>Attention.</i>

143
00:08:42,405 --> 00:08:46,102
<i>This is the New York Police Department.</i>
<i>We have you surrounded.</i>

144
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,869
Come on, Charlie, hurry up!

145
00:08:49,712 --> 00:08:52,374
Waffles! She's frozen with fear!

146
00:08:52,848 --> 00:08:54,440
<i>Surrender now!</i>

147
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,085
- Get over there! Move!
- <i>I repeat.</i>

148
00:08:57,253 --> 00:08:59,847
Come on, Louis, come on!
What is wrong with you?

149
00:09:00,022 --> 00:09:02,115
It's not my fault! Waffles is upset!

150
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:07,251
Perhaps you should've thought of that
before you took your dog on a crime spree!

151
00:09:07,763 --> 00:09:09,196
Come on, girl!

152
00:09:10,866 --> 00:09:12,800
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

153
00:09:17,673 --> 00:09:19,641
Dead end, Louis. Dead end.

154
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,300
No, it's not, Charlie. Look at this.

155
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:26,105
- Think I got a way out.
- You don't even know where that goes. No!

156
00:09:26,282 --> 00:09:27,306
We can do this.

157
00:09:32,421 --> 00:09:35,015
You can stay here if you want.
I'm going down that chute!

158
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:36,556
I love you, Mama!

159
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:43,193
Louis?

160
00:10:02,318 --> 00:10:03,785
- Not over here.
- Where'd they go?

161
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:07,252
<i>We lost them. Standing by</i>
<i>for further instructions. Over.</i>

162
00:10:08,157 --> 00:10:10,625
Anything else you'd like me
to help you with today?

163
00:10:10,793 --> 00:10:13,455
No, that's pretty much it.

164
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,566
<i>In what police are calling</i>
<i>one of the largest seizures of stolen goods...</i>

165
00:10:21,737 --> 00:10:24,137
<i>... in the history of New York City...</i>

166
00:10:24,307 --> 00:10:29,939
<i>... thieves inexplicably led police to a treasure</i>
<i>trove of stolen cars, furs, paintings</i>...

167
00:10:31,614 --> 00:10:35,243
Louis Booker, you degenerate moron.

168
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:38,717
Were these Medieval times
and you a knight in shining armor...

169
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,483
...you would, I have no doubt,
slay the maiden and save the dragon.

170
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,588
Waffles!

171
00:10:45,761 --> 00:10:49,162
- Sal, if we could explain...
- As for you, Charlie...

172
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:51,698
...after the tragic death of your father...

173
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:54,995
...I married your mother, promising her
I would raise you as my own.

174
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:58,663
You chose not to take the Maggio name.
I did not complain.

175
00:10:58,841 --> 00:11:02,242
And when you wanted
to go to beauty school...

176
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:06,313
...as boys who lose their fathers
early in life often do...

177
00:11:06,482 --> 00:11:09,383
...I did not snivel at your intentions, did I?

178
00:11:09,552 --> 00:11:12,248
- No, Salvatore, you did not. In fact...
- In fact...

179
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:16,915
...I bought a beauty parlor
so you could sit on your lazy butt all day.

180
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:19,718
Four and a half million you cost me.

181
00:11:19,895 --> 00:11:23,558
Were you anybody else,
you'd be dead by now.

182
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:27,225
- Sal, we understand that you're upset.
- It's not your fault.

183
00:11:27,803 --> 00:11:29,100
What?

184
00:11:29,972 --> 00:11:33,533
A lion can raise a mouse,
but the mouse is still a mouse.

185
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:38,877
And you, Charlie, are that mouse.

186
00:11:40,015 --> 00:11:41,676
Look at this.

187
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:43,512
He takes it.

188
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:45,119
Chicken blood.

189
00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:48,054
Excuse me, Sal?

190
00:11:48,224 --> 00:11:53,560
You said that he was a mouse, so that
would be mouse blood, not chicken blood.

191
00:11:53,729 --> 00:11:54,787
Right?

192
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,263
Go on, Sal, I'm here if you need me.

193
00:11:58,868 --> 00:12:00,859
The salient point is...

194
00:12:01,036 --> 00:12:06,406
...I must continue to live with my lovely wife
and tears on her pillow are a plethora to me.

195
00:12:06,575 --> 00:12:09,339
Anathema to me!
You see what they got me doing?

196
00:12:09,512 --> 00:12:11,480
- I can't even talk straight!
- Take it easy.

197
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,080
So...

198
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:19,414
...l'm giving you both another chance
to redeem yourselves.

199
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:22,056
- Thank you, we won't disappoint you.
- No, we won't.

200
00:12:22,224 --> 00:12:24,215
Of that I'm sure.

201
00:12:24,393 --> 00:12:25,792
Frankie...

202
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,325
Hey, kid. Go long.

203
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:34,365
Why don't you fill the boys in.
A mission of absolution.

204
00:12:34,537 --> 00:12:38,234
It's simple. You take this envelope
to JFK Airport...

205
00:12:38,407 --> 00:12:41,774
- No problem.
...where you catch a flight for Sydney.

206
00:12:41,944 --> 00:12:45,209
Wow, that's...
You know, Louis has got this thing...

207
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:49,317
Yeah, my mama got the gout
and if I'm not home to rub her feet...

208
00:12:49,485 --> 00:12:52,682
...her ankles swell up
and she can't take her house shoes off.

209
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,483
- This really isn't much warning.
- You need a warning?

210
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,120
- No.
- Well, then...

211
00:12:58,294 --> 00:13:03,357
From Sydney, you take the Old South Road
due north to a place called Coober Pedy...

212
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,296
...where you meet a man named Mr. Smith.

213
00:13:06,469 --> 00:13:09,666
You give this envelope to Mr. Smith.

214
00:13:10,806 --> 00:13:15,175
Mr. Smith is expecting you no later
than noon, local time. You will not be late.

215
00:13:15,344 --> 00:13:16,777
What's in here, man?

216
00:13:16,946 --> 00:13:22,077
You will not look in that envelope
under any circumstances, understood?

217
00:13:22,251 --> 00:13:23,684
- I can't hear you...
- Understood?

218
00:13:23,853 --> 00:13:25,480
Oh, yeah.

219
00:13:26,288 --> 00:13:30,782
Should you run into any problems,
you can reach Mr. Smith at this number.

220
00:13:32,862 --> 00:13:34,193
Get out of here.

221
00:13:34,864 --> 00:13:37,833
I can't believe that stuff happened.
I'm wearing my lucky jacket.

222
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,901
Lucky jacket? You've worn that jacket
for over 10 years...

223
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,561
...and luck has never even
remotely come near you.

224
00:13:46,342 --> 00:13:47,366
Australia?

225
00:13:47,543 --> 00:13:51,001
And then they're just gonna turn
around and come right back again.

226
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,614
- It won't be so bad.
- Yeah, why not?

227
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:56,813
We're canceling their return trip.

228
00:13:58,654 --> 00:14:01,384
- Louis, how much time we got left?
- Fourteen hours.

229
00:14:01,557 --> 00:14:04,082
When is the food coming? I'm starving.

230
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,491
Don't even worry about that.
I got you covered.

231
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,199
Are you, like, 4 years old?

232
00:14:13,369 --> 00:14:15,963
If you're not hungry,
I can put these back in my pocket.

233
00:14:16,138 --> 00:14:19,005
Wait. I think I'll have this one.

234
00:14:19,508 --> 00:14:21,135
Good choice.

235
00:14:29,518 --> 00:14:32,419
What is that? And why is my mouth on fire?

236
00:14:32,588 --> 00:14:34,715
That's the new Super Atomic Jaw Buster!

237
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,790
Extra hot!

238
00:14:38,193 --> 00:14:40,218
Are you trying to kill me?

239
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,796
There's nothing wrong with this!
Stop acting like a baby!

240
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:50,129
All right, let me up.

241
00:14:51,173 --> 00:14:54,700
- What for?
- How many things could I have to do?

242
00:14:56,045 --> 00:14:57,672
My bad.

243
00:15:04,753 --> 00:15:07,278
Hey, how are you doing?

244
00:15:07,456 --> 00:15:08,787
Good.

245
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,836
Oh, my God!

246
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,634
Charlie!

247
00:15:30,245 --> 00:15:33,214
- Someone's in here!
- It's me, Charlie. Open up!

248
00:15:33,382 --> 00:15:35,350
- What?
- Check this out.

249
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:38,247
- You're not supposed to open this.
- That's, like, 50 grand.

250
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,480
Oh, my God.
Something doesn't smell right. Look at it!

251
00:15:41,657 --> 00:15:42,919
I know, I'm looking!

252
00:15:43,092 --> 00:15:46,653
I've never seen so much green
in one little brown package!

253
00:15:46,829 --> 00:15:48,763
And now it's in my hands!

254
00:15:48,931 --> 00:15:50,421
It slipped out.

255
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:52,490
Here, help me scoop it up.

256
00:15:52,668 --> 00:15:55,136
- This is one big load!
- What a mess!

257
00:15:55,304 --> 00:15:58,273
- I just want to roll around in it!
- Hand me the rest of the pile.

258
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,908
- Can I hold it?
- No! Dump it in the envelope.

259
00:16:01,076 --> 00:16:03,601
- Maybe we should flush it.
- We're not gonna flush it.

260
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:07,806
I'll put it in my pocket, leave this room,
and take it to Australia.

261
00:16:07,983 --> 00:16:11,384
If you're gonna do that, give it here.
Let me kiss it for good luck.

262
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:14,215
You're not gonna kiss it!
It's bad enough you touched it!

263
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,985
- Before you put it away, can I smell it?
- Maybe later.

264
00:16:20,095 --> 00:16:21,619
No, no, no.

265
00:16:21,797 --> 00:16:23,662
It's not what it looks like.

266
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:33,897
Next, please.

267
00:16:35,511 --> 00:16:37,672
G'day, mate! G'day.

268
00:16:39,648 --> 00:16:42,617
Could you try not to draw the attention
of the entire airport?

269
00:16:42,785 --> 00:16:44,082
Why? What's wrong?

270
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,517
The law states we're only allowed
to have $ 10,000.

271
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:50,523
We are carrying $50,000 of mob money.

272
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:53,161
If they find it, I'm anticipating consequences.

273
00:16:53,328 --> 00:16:55,888
Like, perhaps, I don't know,
let's say, prison?

274
00:16:56,198 --> 00:16:58,257
G'day, mate!

275
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,127
You know what? It's my fault.
I didn't keep the sentences short enough.

276
00:17:02,304 --> 00:17:04,295
I heard you, Charlie, all right?

277
00:17:04,473 --> 00:17:07,442
Now, if you're worried, give me
the money. I'll walk it through.

278
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,301
Okay.

279
00:17:09,478 --> 00:17:11,810
Let me see, put my fate in your hands.

280
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,574
This is such an agonizing decision. No.

281
00:17:15,317 --> 00:17:17,114
All right, then. Just remember...

282
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,881
...the key is to act like
you don't have anything to hide, all right?

283
00:17:21,056 --> 00:17:22,216
Next, please.

284
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:24,190
Watch the master.

285
00:17:25,194 --> 00:17:26,661
G'day!

286
00:17:28,897 --> 00:17:30,194
How are you doing?

287
00:17:30,365 --> 00:17:32,356
- Doing good. How are you?
- I'm all right.

288
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,564
Hit it up top!

289
00:17:40,876 --> 00:17:42,605
There we go. There we go.

290
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:44,570
G'day, mate.

291
00:17:48,517 --> 00:17:49,882
Next, please.

292
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:56,980
G'day, mate.

293
00:17:58,393 --> 00:18:01,885
They're my hairdressing scissors.
They're my hairdressing scissors!

294
00:18:05,534 --> 00:18:08,901
I can...
I can explain about that money.

295
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,769
You will explain...

296
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:14,269
...$63?

297
00:18:15,911 --> 00:18:18,072
- Louis, I lost the money!
- What?

298
00:18:18,247 --> 00:18:20,238
I lost the money!
Salvatore Maggio's money!

299
00:18:20,415 --> 00:18:22,349
Hey, Charlie, calm down, all right?

300
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,919
The trick is not to look suspicious.

301
00:18:26,088 --> 00:18:28,147
Make them watch this hand...

302
00:18:28,757 --> 00:18:30,782
...instead of this one.
- Oh, my God!

303
00:18:31,426 --> 00:18:32,757
Had you going, didn't I?

304
00:18:32,928 --> 00:18:35,761
- That is not funny, Louis!
- Get in the car, baby!

305
00:18:36,832 --> 00:18:40,632
- They didn't have a Cadillac?
- This is the Cadillac of the Outback.

306
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:11,097
You know, Charlie, this mysterious
Mr. Smith we're gonna meet?

307
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:15,832
- I don't think that's his real name.
- Nothing escapes you, Louis.

308
00:19:16,772 --> 00:19:18,706
What's eating you, man?

309
00:19:19,675 --> 00:19:22,473
Don't tell me this is about
that girl on the plane.

310
00:19:22,644 --> 00:19:25,204
- No, it's more than that.
- Coober Pedy! Right here!

311
00:19:26,548 --> 00:19:29,517
I got it. Here we go. Here we go.

312
00:19:30,118 --> 00:19:32,712
Let's face it, I'm never
gonna find the right girl.

313
00:19:32,888 --> 00:19:35,288
You gotta stop it with this "never" stuff.

314
00:19:35,457 --> 00:19:39,257
Two days ago, we never thought
we'd be in Australia, but we here!

315
00:19:43,866 --> 00:19:46,733
- Come on, give me a beat.
- Come on, play with the radio.

316
00:19:46,902 --> 00:19:50,804
Come on, man! I want to play with you.
Give me a beat, man!

317
00:20:26,408 --> 00:20:29,036
- What the hell?
- My God.

318
00:20:31,013 --> 00:20:32,913
I killed a kangaroo.

319
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,877
I never saw it.

320
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,547
It's such a beautiful animal.

321
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:42,246
It's the national symbol of Australia...

322
00:20:42,424 --> 00:20:44,153
...and I killed it.
- Don't worry.

323
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:48,285
I read that the kangaroos are
the rodents of the Outback. We cool!

324
00:20:48,463 --> 00:20:51,899
- Shouldn't we bury it or something?
- My uncle has one rule:

325
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:54,763
Whenever you hit something,
keep on rolling. So let's roll.

326
00:20:54,937 --> 00:20:57,599
I can't leave it there.
I got to pull it off to the side.

327
00:20:57,773 --> 00:20:59,798
You pulling by yourself, then.

328
00:20:59,975 --> 00:21:02,671
God, I am so sorry, little buddy.

329
00:21:06,048 --> 00:21:08,539
Charlie, don't move. Stay right there.

330
00:21:08,717 --> 00:21:11,242
Louis, what are you doing? Louis?

331
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,547
You guys look so adorable.

332
00:21:14,122 --> 00:21:16,283
- G'day, mate!
- Stop that, Louis.

333
00:21:16,725 --> 00:21:18,556
Hey, Charlie, hold on!
Hold on, hold on.

334
00:21:18,727 --> 00:21:20,285
You know who he looks like?

335
00:21:20,462 --> 00:21:22,123
Jackie Legs!

336
00:21:22,664 --> 00:21:25,963
Jackie Legs from Canarsie with the goatee!
Always wears sunglasses!

337
00:21:26,134 --> 00:21:28,432
- What are you talking about?
- Hold on. Look.

338
00:21:29,338 --> 00:21:31,533
Okay, look at it.
Right there. Look at that.

339
00:21:33,141 --> 00:21:34,938
Jeez, that is Jackie Legs.

340
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,477
All right, Louis, enough.
Help me here.

341
00:21:42,017 --> 00:21:43,917
It's lucky jacket time.

342
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,821
Come on, Louis, have some respect.
It's bad enough we ran him over.

343
00:21:53,996 --> 00:21:56,590
Come on, just one picture
for the Brooklyn crew.

344
00:21:56,765 --> 00:21:58,494
All right, one.

345
00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:01,636
- But let's make this quick.
- Stay up there, big boy.

346
00:22:01,803 --> 00:22:03,828
Say "cheese."

347
00:22:04,706 --> 00:22:08,198
All right, come on, let's get this jacket off.
We got things to do, Louis.

348
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,276
Hey, come on, Charlie. One more.

349
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,342
This could be our Christmas card.

350
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,155
- Louis.
- What? What?

351
00:22:29,164 --> 00:22:30,153
Charlie.

352
00:22:32,701 --> 00:22:34,100
Jeez!

353
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:37,066
Hey, look.

354
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,574
- We didn't hurt him after all.
- It looked like we did.

355
00:22:42,577 --> 00:22:44,772
You're a tough little guy, aren't you?

356
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:50,383
Hey, look how tall he is.

357
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,957
You all right, dog? Come on, come on!

358
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:08,761
I just got my ass kicked by a marsupial!

359
00:23:12,607 --> 00:23:15,201
- You want to know the best part?
- What?

360
00:23:15,377 --> 00:23:19,279
Now I never have to see
that stupid red jacket of yours again!

361
00:23:30,525 --> 00:23:31,549
Charlie?

362
00:23:32,194 --> 00:23:33,661
- Charlie!
- What?

363
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,457
The kangaroo got the money.

364
00:23:39,234 --> 00:23:41,225
What are you talking about?

365
00:23:41,403 --> 00:23:45,032
I put the money in the jacket
and the jacket on the kangaroo...

366
00:23:45,207 --> 00:23:48,005
...and now he hopping away.

367
00:23:50,912 --> 00:23:52,777
The kangaroo has the money?

368
00:23:55,317 --> 00:23:58,980
The kangaroo has
Salvatore Maggio's $50,000?

369
00:24:00,555 --> 00:24:01,988
Yeah.

370
00:24:12,834 --> 00:24:15,496
Who puts a jacket
with 50,000 on a kangaroo?

371
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:18,537
A dead kangaroo! He was dead, Charlie!

372
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:23,644
You should have just let me drown, Louis,
I mean it!

373
00:24:27,816 --> 00:24:30,649
- I see you now, sucker!
- Go, go, go! We got him! Go!

374
00:24:32,654 --> 00:24:35,555
Look at that little fellow go, Charlie!
Look at him go!

375
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,860
Here we come, baby!
We gaining on him! Oh, my God.

376
00:24:49,037 --> 00:24:51,403
Look at the fellow move, man.

377
00:24:56,044 --> 00:24:58,205
I'm gonna pull up.
Reach out and grab the money!

378
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,679
You want me to open the door
and lean out of a speeding car!

379
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:05,342
Fine, Charlie! We'll just drive past him
and hope he hops in the jeep!

380
00:25:07,722 --> 00:25:09,349
- Here I go!
- Okay.

381
00:25:10,358 --> 00:25:11,916
- Here I go.
- Lean out there, baby!

382
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,583
Get me closer. Get me closer!

383
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,730
- He's hopping like a rabbit!
- Closer!

384
00:25:15,897 --> 00:25:18,024
- Get me closer!
- I'm trying to get closer!

385
00:25:18,733 --> 00:25:20,667
- Come on! Get him, baby!
- Closer, Louis!

386
00:25:20,835 --> 00:25:25,067
- Get the money, Charlie!
- Closer, Louis! I almost got it!

387
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,073
- I'm almost there!
- Come on, Charlie! I can't hold on!

388
00:25:29,044 --> 00:25:30,671
Get the money!

389
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,379
As it turns out, this is hard.

390
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,219
What are these things?

391
00:25:43,391 --> 00:25:46,417
They're termite mounds!
I read about them in the book!

392
00:25:46,595 --> 00:25:48,927
Careful, you almost missed one!

393
00:25:50,932 --> 00:25:53,662
- You mine now, sucker!
- Yeah!

394
00:25:56,838 --> 00:25:59,238
Go, go, go!

395
00:26:00,442 --> 00:26:01,966
Stop, stop, stop!

396
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,324
I don't suppose you took the insurance?

397
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,131
My uncle always told me
that was just a rip-off.

398
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:35,233
Don't worry, Charlie.
We'll get the money back, all right?

399
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,570
It can't go far.

400
00:26:36,745 --> 00:26:39,475
It's a continent, Louis. He can go very far.

401
00:26:39,648 --> 00:26:42,481
I know it's a continent. I read the book.

402
00:26:42,651 --> 00:26:46,917
You happen to read the chapter on
not putting your jacket on a wild animal?

403
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:52,323
No, but I read one on how an aboriginal
can kill a white man with a twig.

404
00:26:52,494 --> 00:26:53,586
You wanna see that one?

405
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:28,862
The Old Alice Inn.

406
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:32,295
I'll buy you a beer and we'll catch
the end of the Knicks game.

407
00:27:35,103 --> 00:27:37,003
Two beers. Big beers.

408
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,968
I'm gonna call Mr. Smith, let him know
there's been a slight delay.

409
00:27:42,143 --> 00:27:43,701
- Slight delay?
- Yeah.

410
00:27:43,878 --> 00:27:46,540
But we're working on it, all right?
Give me his number.

411
00:27:49,818 --> 00:27:51,911
- Where's your phone?
- Around near the dunnies.

412
00:27:52,821 --> 00:27:55,051
- You guys have a Denny's?
- No, the dunny.

413
00:27:56,224 --> 00:27:58,556
The bog trough? The long drop?

414
00:27:59,127 --> 00:28:01,152
- The thunder box?
- You know what?

415
00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:03,320
I'm just gonna look for it by the bathroom.

416
00:28:10,638 --> 00:28:12,697
Now, there's a Yank that can drink.

417
00:28:14,175 --> 00:28:17,110
Any Yank that can drink is all right with me.

418
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,678
G'day. My name is Blue.

419
00:28:21,816 --> 00:28:24,410
- Charlie.
- Nice to meet you, Chaza.

420
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:28,280
- Charlie.
- That's what I said, Chaza.

421
00:28:29,391 --> 00:28:31,086
We're only two hours late.

422
00:28:32,093 --> 00:28:34,857
He should be a reasonable
and understanding man.

423
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,796
- <i>What?</i>
- Mr. Smith?

424
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:43,063
- Yeah, you might not know me, but...
- <i>Where are you bludgers?</i>

425
00:28:43,605 --> 00:28:46,870
I'm out here in the back of Bullamakanka
up to me ears in heat stroke...

426
00:28:47,041 --> 00:28:48,770
<i>... waiting for you two Yanks.</i>

427
00:28:48,943 --> 00:28:50,843
<i>Where's me package?</i>

428
00:28:51,846 --> 00:28:54,940
It's been temporarily misplaced.

429
00:28:55,116 --> 00:28:57,346
I don't reckon you respect me very much.

430
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:00,147
First you steal my package
and now you're on the phone...

431
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:01,447
<i>... razzing me about it.</i>

432
00:29:01,623 --> 00:29:04,751
We didn't steal your package.
I swear! We're gonna get it back!

433
00:29:04,926 --> 00:29:08,157
You'd be a banger short of a barbie
if you didn't, when I find you!

434
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:10,559
You better get ready
to cough it up...

435
00:29:10,732 --> 00:29:13,963
...otherwise, I'll chop you into snags
and feed you to the crocs.

436
00:29:14,135 --> 00:29:16,103
- Mr. Smith?
- <i>Have a nice day.</i>

437
00:29:19,574 --> 00:29:21,474
One of me favorites.

438
00:29:29,284 --> 00:29:32,082
A kangaroo. A kangaroo.
Kangaroo...

439
00:29:32,253 --> 00:29:33,652
Wildlife Foundation.

440
00:29:36,891 --> 00:29:40,827
- Louis, this is Blue. Blue, this is Louis.
- Hey, Blue.

441
00:29:40,995 --> 00:29:44,522
- What'd Mr. Smith say?
- He was nice.

442
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,929
- He said everything was cool.
- Really?

443
00:29:47,101 --> 00:29:50,400
He did say that we should do our best
to get the package back.

444
00:29:50,572 --> 00:29:53,905
- Right. The package.
- The package!

445
00:29:55,109 --> 00:29:56,167
Charlie?

446
00:29:56,344 --> 00:29:58,812
Order me another drink. I got a plan.

447
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,178
This isn't my day.

448
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,394
You mind leaving a little for the camels?

449
00:30:16,464 --> 00:30:17,453
You're American.

450
00:30:17,632 --> 00:30:20,829
And you're drinking water
that comes from a stagnant pond.

451
00:30:21,002 --> 00:30:23,732
I'm from Brooklyn. I've had a lot worse.

452
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,873
- My name is Louis.
- Name's Jessie.

453
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,565
- Nice to meet you.
- Wanna give me a hand?

454
00:30:29,143 --> 00:30:30,440
Okay.

455
00:30:33,014 --> 00:30:36,677
No offense, but these are
the ugliest rabbits I've ever seen.

456
00:30:36,851 --> 00:30:39,513
They're called bilbies.
They're almost extinct.

457
00:30:39,687 --> 00:30:44,317
In fact, it's up to these guys to repopulate
the entire Devil's Marbles area.

458
00:30:44,492 --> 00:30:47,188
Somebody's gonna be having fun tonight!

459
00:30:47,362 --> 00:30:48,624
That's the plan.

460
00:30:48,796 --> 00:30:51,026
Looks like you'll need more bilbies, though.

461
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:54,168
Well, if the foundation I work for
had more money...

462
00:30:55,303 --> 00:30:57,328
You mean the Wildlife Foundation?

463
00:30:57,705 --> 00:31:00,003
- You work here?
- Yeah.

464
00:31:00,508 --> 00:31:03,807
Thank you, Lord! This is great!
I need some help.

465
00:31:03,978 --> 00:31:06,503
I put my lucky jacket
on the back of a dead kangaroo...

466
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:09,047
...who came to life
and hopped off with my money.

467
00:31:09,217 --> 00:31:12,015
- You do need help.
- No, no, no, I'm for real.

468
00:31:12,186 --> 00:31:13,414
Can you help me?

469
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,283
Do you have any idea where he is?

470
00:31:16,591 --> 00:31:17,580
No.

471
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:21,217
It seems to me you need an airplane.
You need a tranquilizer gun...

472
00:31:23,331 --> 00:31:25,026
You need a list.

473
00:31:54,295 --> 00:31:57,924
Come on, come on, come on!
He's got it!

474
00:32:01,235 --> 00:32:02,759
Charlie! Charlie!

475
00:32:03,404 --> 00:32:05,099
Come here, man. Come here!

476
00:32:05,273 --> 00:32:07,104
Give me one sec, guys.

477
00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:10,141
You've gotta see this guy drink!
He's unbelievable!

478
00:32:10,311 --> 00:32:12,745
I figured out how to catch that kangaroo.

479
00:32:12,914 --> 00:32:16,042
First we hit it with a car and
now you want to blow its head off?

480
00:32:16,217 --> 00:32:17,650
No.

481
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:22,051
This is a tranquilizer dart.
It works in three stages.

482
00:32:22,223 --> 00:32:26,523
Stage one: Temporary blindness.
Stage two: Partial paralysis.

483
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:29,686
And stage three: Complete
shutdown of all motor skills.

484
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,991
- Totally humane.
- Sounds humane.

485
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:34,031
I said it was temporary.

486
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:37,660
I walked to this wildlife office
and this American girl that works there...

487
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:40,000
...and she is...

488
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:50,873
Epileptic?

489
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,417
Her name is Jessie.

490
00:32:52,587 --> 00:32:55,420
I told her the story and showed her
a photo of the kangaroo.

491
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,990
You told her the kangaroo has $50,000?

492
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,493
I told her the kangaroo has $4000
and our passports.

493
00:33:02,664 --> 00:33:04,029
Not bad.

494
00:33:04,198 --> 00:33:07,634
She told me the best way
to find a kangaroo is by air.

495
00:33:07,802 --> 00:33:09,030
What's that?

496
00:33:09,203 --> 00:33:11,194
A number to a bush plane that we can hire.

497
00:33:11,773 --> 00:33:14,173
- I like it.
- Let's go call.

498
00:33:19,047 --> 00:33:21,948
If I didn't know you better,
I'd say this is a honey of a plan.

499
00:33:22,116 --> 00:33:23,845
Dang skippy.

500
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,680
Excuse me, mates.

501
00:33:28,856 --> 00:33:31,256
Gotta point Percy at the porcelain.

502
00:33:34,028 --> 00:33:35,962
Gee, almost made it.

503
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,335
Pilot's personal number.

504
00:33:58,486 --> 00:33:59,919
<i>Louis?</i>

505
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,055
Do you have a backup plan?

506
00:34:07,095 --> 00:34:11,464
I sure hope the two pots of coffee
and the Red Bull we gave him were enough!

507
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,566
Hey, man! How're you doing up there?

508
00:34:13,735 --> 00:34:16,329
Never better, mate!
Why do you ask?

509
00:34:16,504 --> 00:34:20,099
No reason. It's just that you
were passed out an hour ago.

510
00:34:20,274 --> 00:34:22,105
That's just me morning ritual, mate.

511
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,744
I couldn't help but notice
that this is the <i>Flying Dingo IV.</i>

512
00:34:29,517 --> 00:34:31,280
What happened to the <i>I, II</i> and <i>III</i>?

513
00:34:41,028 --> 00:34:43,792
<i>Now use the word in a sentence.</i>

514
00:34:44,632 --> 00:34:50,366
Amorphous: Having no definite form.
Shapeless, as in:

515
00:34:50,538 --> 00:34:54,406
"After Joey Clams got whacked,
his head was amorphous."

516
00:34:54,575 --> 00:34:57,305
<i>That was excellent.</i>
<i>Now let's move to the next level.</i>

517
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:59,836
I think you should take this.

518
00:35:01,616 --> 00:35:02,605
Hello.

519
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:09,155
I'm aggrieved to hear that, Mr. Smith.

520
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,258
Of course we had a deal.

521
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:17,354
Please, advise me if this situation changes.

522
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,761
Those two <i>mammalucco</i> didn't show.

523
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:25,000
Our friend feels they pocketed the 50 G's.

524
00:35:25,173 --> 00:35:26,868
Maybe they figured it out.

525
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,373
My stepson couldn't figure out
a cheese sandwich...

526
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,138
...if they spotted him the pumpernickel
and the provolone.

527
00:35:33,781 --> 00:35:35,043
So, what do you want to do?

528
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,813
You possess a valid passport.

529
00:35:41,756 --> 00:35:43,883
I can't see anything from up here.

530
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:46,720
Hey, do you think you can
take us down a little lower?

531
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:49,488
Hang on to your knickers,
we're going in!

532
00:35:52,834 --> 00:35:55,530
A little lower! A little lower!

533
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,937
Look out for that tree!

534
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,871
Could you please not do that again?
Thank you!

535
00:36:09,383 --> 00:36:11,544
Hey, Charlie!
Look to the left!

536
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:13,677
Kangaroos!

537
00:36:13,855 --> 00:36:17,256
They're kangaroos, all right!
A lot of kangaroos!

538
00:36:17,959 --> 00:36:21,053
None with a red jacket.
You think he could be someplace else?

539
00:36:21,229 --> 00:36:22,218
Wait!

540
00:36:22,396 --> 00:36:25,194
- Look, look, it's Jackie Legs!
- There he is!

541
00:36:25,366 --> 00:36:27,994
- That's him, that's him!
- I knew this would work!

542
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:31,532
- Blue, bring us around!
- Yeah, right!

543
00:36:35,877 --> 00:36:36,935
Get me there, Blue!

544
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:50,618
Get up right on his tail
and stay with him no matter what!

545
00:36:53,094 --> 00:36:54,925
Say hello to my little friend!

546
00:36:57,665 --> 00:37:00,133
I got you now, Jackie Legs!

547
00:37:00,701 --> 00:37:02,931
I'm gonna get you now.

548
00:37:07,541 --> 00:37:08,906
You hit him?

549
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,541
I don't know.
He's still hopping.

550
00:37:11,712 --> 00:37:13,612
Maybe it takes time
for it to take effect.

551
00:37:13,781 --> 00:37:15,715
Yeah, all right.

552
00:37:17,518 --> 00:37:18,985
Charlie?

553
00:37:21,622 --> 00:37:22,953
Oh, my God.

554
00:37:23,124 --> 00:37:25,285
- Mates?
- Yes?

555
00:37:25,459 --> 00:37:29,293
Got a bit of a wrinkle here.
The old optics are on the fritz.

556
00:37:29,463 --> 00:37:32,990
Stage one: Temporary blindness.

557
00:37:37,271 --> 00:37:38,738
- Was that the engine?!
- No.

558
00:37:38,906 --> 00:37:41,568
That was me. For some reason,
I can't move me arms.

559
00:37:41,742 --> 00:37:44,939
Stage two: Partial paralysis!

560
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:48,141
Charlie, can you lean over
and take the stick?

561
00:37:48,316 --> 00:37:50,284
I can still work the foot pedals.

562
00:37:50,451 --> 00:37:53,113
- Oh, God!
- Take the stick firmly in hand and...

563
00:37:56,424 --> 00:37:58,483
- Blue!
- Stage three:

564
00:37:58,659 --> 00:38:00,820
Total shutdown of motor skills!

565
00:38:02,096 --> 00:38:04,030
English, Blue, English!

566
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,295
Stage four:

567
00:38:06,968 --> 00:38:09,095
Fiery crash!

568
00:38:57,284 --> 00:38:58,376
You okay?

569
00:38:58,552 --> 00:38:59,541
- Yeah.
- You sure?

570
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,119
- Yeah.
- Good.

571
00:39:01,288 --> 00:39:02,983
'Cause I am gonna beat you soft!

572
00:39:03,157 --> 00:39:05,421
- Like this is my fault?
- First rule of aviation:

573
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,992
You never shoot the pilot!

574
00:39:07,161 --> 00:39:09,322
Assume crash positions!

575
00:39:09,897 --> 00:39:11,831
Blue, we already crashed.

576
00:39:14,035 --> 00:39:15,935
Right. No worries, then.

577
00:39:24,845 --> 00:39:26,142
Can I help you?

578
00:39:26,313 --> 00:39:29,282
Think some friends of mine
passed through here.

579
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,315
A couple of Yanks?

580
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,420
- Friends?
- Yeah.

581
00:39:35,022 --> 00:39:38,185
I promised the family back home
I'd take care of them.

582
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,357
Hello? Hello?

583
00:39:41,529 --> 00:39:43,759
Come on, Blue, you got to
do something, man.

584
00:39:45,066 --> 00:39:46,761
Hello? Hello?

585
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,095
Charlie, we gotta do something.

586
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,259
What can we do?

587
00:39:50,438 --> 00:39:54,704
We have to hope Santa Claus over there
can fix the radio or someone looks for us.

588
00:39:55,376 --> 00:39:58,903
Actually, someone is looking for us.

589
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,441
Mr. Smith.

590
00:40:04,752 --> 00:40:06,686
- Louis!
- He didn't say...

591
00:40:06,854 --> 00:40:08,048
...what I said he said.

592
00:40:08,222 --> 00:40:10,588
What did he say
that you didn't say he said?

593
00:40:10,758 --> 00:40:13,886
He thinks we stole his package, man,
so he's coming after us.

594
00:40:14,395 --> 00:40:17,990
He mentioned cutting us up into little
bitty pieces and snacks for a crocodile.

595
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,325
Then the phone went out...

596
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,765
If Smith thinks we stole his money,
then by now Sal thinks we stole it.

597
00:40:22,937 --> 00:40:25,667
Sal's not gonna hurt us.
He's married to your mother.

598
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,801
If Sal thinks we stole his money...

599
00:40:27,975 --> 00:40:30,739
...he'll kill us in front of her,
then make her clean it up.

600
00:40:30,911 --> 00:40:33,846
All we have to do is find the money
before Mr. Smith finds us...

601
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,242
...and everything is okay.

602
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:38,078
So what you're saying is that
we should find the money.

603
00:40:38,252 --> 00:40:39,913
- Yes.
- How, Louis? How?

604
00:40:40,087 --> 00:40:42,885
How are we gonna catch a kangaroo on foot?

605
00:40:47,828 --> 00:40:49,159
Got it.

606
00:40:49,396 --> 00:40:50,988
You ever heard of Devil's Marbles?

607
00:40:51,165 --> 00:40:53,463
Due east. Bit of a walk, though.

608
00:40:53,634 --> 00:40:55,261
Why, what's there?

609
00:40:55,436 --> 00:40:57,836
The lady I told you about
at the wildlife office.

610
00:40:58,005 --> 00:40:59,336
- The epileptic?
- Yes.

611
00:40:59,507 --> 00:41:02,601
She works with animals and I bet
she can help us catch Jackie Legs.

612
00:41:02,776 --> 00:41:04,767
- Please!
- Charlie.

613
00:41:04,945 --> 00:41:07,743
It's better than being cut up
into little bitty pieces, man.

614
00:41:07,915 --> 00:41:09,780
Not if you go first and I get to watch.

615
00:41:10,417 --> 00:41:14,319
Look out, you blokes go ahead.
I'll fix the radio, be right with you.

616
00:41:15,823 --> 00:41:19,020
- Which way is east, man?
- That way.

617
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,695
- Let's go, man.
- No, no, wait there.

618
00:41:22,296 --> 00:41:23,354
That way.

619
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:27,460
Charlie?

620
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,199
I'm worried about Waffles.

621
00:41:30,371 --> 00:41:32,737
Do you think she'll be okay with Sal?

622
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:33,896
Oh, sure.

623
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:36,872
As long as she doesn't dig up
any bodies in the back yard...

624
00:41:37,044 --> 00:41:40,377
...she should be just fine.
- Good.

625
00:41:41,682 --> 00:41:44,116
How far did Blue say this place was?

626
00:41:44,285 --> 00:41:47,254
He didn't. He just said it was due east.

627
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,389
So is Brooklyn.

628
00:41:56,664 --> 00:41:58,825
- You're the guide?
- Yes, sir.

629
00:41:58,999 --> 00:42:02,628
My name Mr. Jimmy.
First-rate, expert Outback guide.

630
00:42:02,803 --> 00:42:04,862
You'll be most happy with me.

631
00:42:05,206 --> 00:42:07,037
Great freaking start.

632
00:42:07,908 --> 00:42:10,706
Hey, listen, you know where we can
get some guns around here?

633
00:42:10,878 --> 00:42:13,039
No worries. You boys hunters?

634
00:42:14,381 --> 00:42:16,474
Yeah, hunters.

635
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:22,684
I think I just sweated out a bottle of Yoo-Hoo
I drank in the eighth grade.

636
00:42:24,658 --> 00:42:26,956
Be cool. Dingoes.

637
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,230
Hey, that one kind of looks like Waffles.

638
00:42:31,398 --> 00:42:35,198
Yeah, if Waffles had a crazed look
in his eyes and his face caked in blood.

639
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,131
Charlie?

640
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:39,772
Why are they staring at me like that?

641
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:43,706
Because I'm a green leaf salad
and you're the all-you-can-eat buffet.

642
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:49,638
You gotta help me out, man.
They gonna get me like they got that baby!

643
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:53,983
Feel that? Wind suddenly picked up.

644
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:56,850
It's like all of a sudden
the air conditioner's fixed.

645
00:42:58,125 --> 00:42:59,990
Charlie, where are the dingoes going?

646
00:43:00,628 --> 00:43:03,461
I think something bad
is about to happen here, Louis.

647
00:43:03,631 --> 00:43:06,156
Hey, Charlie, look.

648
00:43:08,535 --> 00:43:11,060
This feels good! I feel like I can fly.

649
00:43:11,238 --> 00:43:12,865
Louis!

650
00:43:13,941 --> 00:43:16,102
- Louis!
- I believe I can fly!

651
00:43:18,145 --> 00:43:22,741
Louis, I wanna go back to Brooklyn!

652
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,281
Come in, Tansy, over.

653
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,344
<i>Read you, over.</i>

654
00:43:28,756 --> 00:43:30,189
Boy, am I glad to hear you.

655
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:33,019
<i>Listen, I've crashed me plane.</i>
<i>Can you send some help?</i>

656
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:35,093
Your location, over.

657
00:43:35,262 --> 00:43:39,756
It's west of the Simpson
and just south of King's Canyon.

658
00:43:43,304 --> 00:43:44,669
Tansy?

659
00:43:44,838 --> 00:43:46,271
You read me, Tansy?

660
00:43:47,675 --> 00:43:48,937
Tansy?

661
00:43:50,477 --> 00:43:51,944
Do you read me?

662
00:43:53,314 --> 00:43:56,579
Must have been
some kind of freak sand storm.

663
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:57,808
Think so?

664
00:43:57,985 --> 00:43:59,714
I think you need to eat.

665
00:44:00,321 --> 00:44:02,118
Your blood sugar's getting low.

666
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:05,782
Stop it, Louis. Okay? Please, just stop it.

667
00:44:06,327 --> 00:44:08,921
You know what I could really go for
right about now?

668
00:44:09,096 --> 00:44:11,656
Some Roscoe's chicken and waffles...

669
00:44:11,832 --> 00:44:14,300
...with a side of grits and a side of gravy.

670
00:44:14,468 --> 00:44:16,561
I'm not listening to you.

671
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,034
Or better yet...

672
00:44:18,205 --> 00:44:21,436
...one of those iced mocha-schmoca
things from Starbucks.

673
00:44:21,608 --> 00:44:24,805
They're so cold and creamy.

674
00:44:25,446 --> 00:44:27,175
My God.

675
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:38,187
Can you believe this?

676
00:44:38,359 --> 00:44:40,486
Can you believe our luck?

677
00:44:40,961 --> 00:44:43,191
What are the chances?

678
00:44:45,132 --> 00:44:46,963
It's a miracle!

679
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,536
Oh, yeah!

680
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:57,740
Tunes!

681
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:07,451
Hey, Louis, what are you waiting for?

682
00:45:08,522 --> 00:45:10,683
Come on, hop in.

683
00:45:12,493 --> 00:45:13,790
Hey, look.

684
00:45:14,995 --> 00:45:17,862
- They got Slurpees.
- Oh, Charlie.

685
00:45:22,703 --> 00:45:24,637
Brain freeze!

686
00:45:28,175 --> 00:45:30,302
It seemed so real.

687
00:45:31,378 --> 00:45:32,902
That's why they call it a mirage.

688
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:36,282
At least you got to have fun
for a few minutes.

689
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:41,888
Yeah, because my brain is frying,
and I'm losing contact with reality.

690
00:45:42,055 --> 00:45:46,321
You don't understand this
because this is how you usually function.

691
00:45:48,061 --> 00:45:50,723
- That was uncalled for, Charlie.
- Was it?

692
00:45:52,299 --> 00:45:55,234
Every decision you make, Louis, is a disaster.

693
00:45:55,402 --> 00:45:58,337
That's right, Charlie, just blame me.

694
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:01,736
That way you relieve yourself
of all responsibility.

695
00:46:01,909 --> 00:46:03,604
But let me tell you something...

696
00:46:03,777 --> 00:46:07,611
...it's easier to mock than to do,
and you do nothing.

697
00:46:07,781 --> 00:46:11,080
You just complain and whine like a woman.

698
00:46:12,052 --> 00:46:14,179
You want to see me do something?

699
00:46:14,655 --> 00:46:16,282
Bring it on, queen of the desert.

700
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:40,443
Louis. Louis, wait a second.

701
00:46:40,614 --> 00:46:42,980
I'm having another one of those mirages.

702
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:44,674
And this one's a beauty.

703
00:46:58,298 --> 00:46:59,925
Charlie.

704
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:04,337
Louis, please. Let me just enjoy this.

705
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:21,585
How you doing?

706
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:24,553
- Good. You?
- Good.

707
00:47:36,169 --> 00:47:39,696
Louis, they feel so real.

708
00:47:55,018 --> 00:47:56,713
- It's you.
- Yeah, it's me.

709
00:47:56,886 --> 00:47:58,353
Love the jacket, Charlie.

710
00:47:58,521 --> 00:48:01,922
It's hard to get something
that fits my shoulders. Nice!

711
00:48:02,091 --> 00:48:04,252
How'd you know red was my favorite color?

712
00:48:04,427 --> 00:48:05,621
You can talk!

713
00:48:05,795 --> 00:48:07,660
And I can sing.

714
00:48:15,038 --> 00:48:16,027
This is great.

715
00:48:21,878 --> 00:48:24,369
Jackie? Mr. Legs?

716
00:48:24,547 --> 00:48:27,744
If you could find your way clear
to give me back my money...

717
00:48:27,917 --> 00:48:28,906
Money?

718
00:48:29,085 --> 00:48:32,418
Oh, you mean that money!

719
00:48:34,657 --> 00:48:35,646
Stop that!

720
00:48:35,825 --> 00:48:36,814
Stop that!

721
00:48:37,827 --> 00:48:39,954
Stop that! Hey! Stop that, please!

722
00:48:40,129 --> 00:48:41,494
If Sal finds out...

723
00:48:42,131 --> 00:48:45,897
If I find out what, Charlie?
That you lost my money?

724
00:48:46,469 --> 00:48:49,097
- Sal?
- I ask you to do something for me.

725
00:48:49,272 --> 00:48:50,569
This is not that!

726
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:53,937
- It wasn't my fault, it was Louis.
- Say what? My fault?

727
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:56,738
That's how you pay me back
after I saved your life?

728
00:48:56,913 --> 00:48:59,507
- Louis?
- Next time you're drowning in the ocean...

729
00:48:59,682 --> 00:49:02,742
...call Free Willy!
Let Willy set you free!

730
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:06,612
You know what, Sal?
You were right about him.

731
00:49:06,789 --> 00:49:09,314
- Chicken blood!
- Smell it on his father.

732
00:49:09,492 --> 00:49:11,756
- Smell it on him.
- Chicken blood.

733
00:49:11,928 --> 00:49:14,158
- Chicken blood!
- Chicken blood!

734
00:49:25,775 --> 00:49:27,106
Here.

735
00:49:27,276 --> 00:49:28,868
Drink this.

736
00:49:29,045 --> 00:49:30,876
It'll bring down the swelling.

737
00:49:32,448 --> 00:49:35,474
Unfortunately, it'll also make
your testicles fall off.

738
00:49:39,222 --> 00:49:40,314
I'm kidding.

739
00:49:43,693 --> 00:49:45,786
It won't bring down the swelling.

740
00:50:02,545 --> 00:50:04,376
About bloody time.

741
00:50:08,851 --> 00:50:11,718
- Where are they?
- Piss off!

742
00:50:11,888 --> 00:50:15,289
Fifteen years Special Air Services,
behind the line!

743
00:50:15,458 --> 00:50:18,757
I'm down and out, mate.
I forgot more than you ever learned.

744
00:50:18,928 --> 00:50:20,919
You'll get nothing from me!

745
00:50:21,097 --> 00:50:22,621
Devil's Marbles.

746
00:50:22,799 --> 00:50:24,824
Took off on foot, about ten hours ago.

747
00:50:25,001 --> 00:50:27,231
See, that wasn't so difficult.

748
00:50:35,812 --> 00:50:37,404
Knock-knock.

749
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:39,912
- Very funny.
- Can't be too careful.

750
00:50:41,551 --> 00:50:43,576
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

751
00:50:43,753 --> 00:50:45,778
I didn't think they were real.

752
00:50:46,322 --> 00:50:48,552
Oh, no! I mean,
I thought they were real...

753
00:50:48,725 --> 00:50:51,785
Relax, I know what you mean.
Louis explained.

754
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:56,528
Listen, Louis and I have a little problem...

755
00:50:56,699 --> 00:50:59,327
And I already told him,
I can't help you find your roo.

756
00:50:59,502 --> 00:51:02,266
I've got to get back to Alice Springs. Sorry.

757
00:51:03,339 --> 00:51:04,863
That's okay.

758
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:06,235
I understand.

759
00:51:11,948 --> 00:51:14,280
- What?
- Look...

760
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:19,114
...Louis told me you need some money
to repopulate the earth with your rabbits.

761
00:51:19,288 --> 00:51:20,448
Bilbies.

762
00:51:20,623 --> 00:51:22,022
Bilbies.

763
00:51:22,792 --> 00:51:26,125
How about this, we give you $2000...

764
00:51:26,295 --> 00:51:28,388
...you help us get our stuff back.

765
00:51:28,564 --> 00:51:32,000
- Two thousand dollars?
- Strictly business, no strings attached.

766
00:51:32,168 --> 00:51:34,398
- What do you say? We got a deal?
- Deal.

767
00:51:35,204 --> 00:51:36,694
Great. Hustle makes it happen.

768
00:51:36,873 --> 00:51:38,738
- Let's get moving.
- Now?

769
00:51:39,242 --> 00:51:42,439
You see, our passports are just
about to expire...

770
00:51:42,612 --> 00:51:46,605
Nine of the ten most poisonous snakes
in the world live in Australia.

771
00:51:46,783 --> 00:51:49,251
And they all come out at night.

772
00:51:49,852 --> 00:51:52,082
How do you feel about a morning start?

773
00:51:58,728 --> 00:52:02,789
Doesn't get any better than this, Louis.
Blue skies, fresh air!

774
00:52:02,965 --> 00:52:05,525
And who even knew
there were camels in Australia?

775
00:52:05,701 --> 00:52:09,694
These are noble beasts, my friend.
Proud, majestic...

776
00:52:13,876 --> 00:52:16,674
Get used to it, boys. Camels do that.

777
00:52:18,281 --> 00:52:21,307
I don't want to seem nosy,
but do you have some sort of plan here?

778
00:52:21,484 --> 00:52:23,611
There hasn't been rain for weeks, right?

779
00:52:25,555 --> 00:52:28,251
- Oh, God.
- Come on!

780
00:52:28,825 --> 00:52:32,727
When the water dries up in the basins,
the kangaroos head for the rivers.

781
00:52:34,497 --> 00:52:37,523
So that means we have two choices,
the Finke River or the Todd.

782
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:41,158
Since the Finke is 200 hundred miles away,
I'm leaning toward the Todd.

783
00:52:41,337 --> 00:52:43,703
- Alrighty, then, to the Todd.
- To the Todd.

784
00:52:43,873 --> 00:52:45,500
To the Todd!

785
00:52:46,142 --> 00:52:49,509
Louis, what are you eating?
I picked a bunch of berries at camp.

786
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:51,772
Jessie said they were cool.

787
00:52:51,948 --> 00:52:55,577
They smell just like a bowl of Fruity Pebbles
right before you add the milk.

788
00:52:55,751 --> 00:52:57,912
- Go on, take a whiff.
- No, thank you.

789
00:53:03,492 --> 00:53:06,461
- Give me some of those berries real quick!
- Go on, take some.

790
00:53:09,966 --> 00:53:12,161
Man, these do smell pretty good.

791
00:53:12,335 --> 00:53:15,099
Chicks in New York, they'd pay big money
to smell like that.

792
00:53:15,271 --> 00:53:17,705
They're called snakeskin lily berries. Tut!

793
00:53:18,241 --> 00:53:20,709
Impressive. How long you been in Australia?

794
00:53:20,877 --> 00:53:24,335
I moved here with a friend from Milwaukee
three years ago for a semester...

795
00:53:24,513 --> 00:53:26,208
...and never went back.
- Milwaukee!

796
00:53:26,382 --> 00:53:28,111
You know, I once had a...

797
00:53:32,288 --> 00:53:34,848
What is with these camels?

798
00:53:36,025 --> 00:53:38,152
That one was me.

799
00:53:39,996 --> 00:53:44,933
I swear to God we passed that same bush
two hours ago. What is going on?

800
00:53:45,101 --> 00:53:48,070
- Well, it says here...
- What, again with the map?

801
00:53:48,237 --> 00:53:51,001
Why don't you sit on your head,
try thinking with your butt.

802
00:53:51,173 --> 00:53:52,367
Hey, Frankie, look!

803
00:53:52,808 --> 00:53:55,436
Maybe this hump can tell us where we are.

804
00:53:57,613 --> 00:53:58,910
How are you doing?

805
00:53:59,081 --> 00:54:03,108
Got tranqued, crashed me plane, rescue
party knocked me out and left me to die.

806
00:54:03,286 --> 00:54:05,186
All because of a bloody boomer.

807
00:54:07,056 --> 00:54:09,684
We're looking for Alice Springs.

808
00:54:10,459 --> 00:54:13,587
Heading straight for it, mate.
What about a lift?

809
00:54:13,763 --> 00:54:16,596
- Why not? Get in.
- Beauty.

810
00:54:20,636 --> 00:54:22,604
So what do you think?

811
00:54:23,306 --> 00:54:25,399
No wonder the kangaroos come here.

812
00:54:26,275 --> 00:54:27,264
Come on.

813
00:54:28,978 --> 00:54:30,502
This looks like a good spot.

814
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:34,514
If there's a kangaroo within 500 miles,
he'll show up here eventually.

815
00:54:35,117 --> 00:54:38,450
So when our guy shows up,
how are we gonna catch him?

816
00:54:38,621 --> 00:54:40,987
You know what?
I've been thinking about that.

817
00:54:43,859 --> 00:54:45,486
Have you ever thrown a bolo?

818
00:54:45,928 --> 00:54:46,917
What?

819
00:55:34,877 --> 00:55:37,038
Yo, what's a boomer?

820
00:55:37,213 --> 00:55:38,475
- What?
- A boomer!

821
00:55:38,647 --> 00:55:40,410
Oh, a kangaroo.

822
00:55:40,583 --> 00:55:42,483
It was two of your blokes. Americans.

823
00:55:42,651 --> 00:55:46,246
They were chasing after this kangaroo
in a red shiny jacket.

824
00:55:47,156 --> 00:55:50,216
Don't that dork, Louis Booker,
always wear a shiny red jacket?

825
00:55:50,393 --> 00:55:51,860
Yeah.

826
00:56:06,509 --> 00:56:08,568
Never should have left the pub.

827
00:56:10,913 --> 00:56:12,244
Yes! Yeah!

828
00:56:12,415 --> 00:56:14,576
Is this an Olympic event?
Because I am bolo man!

829
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:16,684
I am bolo man!

830
00:56:16,852 --> 00:56:18,376
- Bingo!
- Dingo? Where?

831
00:56:18,554 --> 00:56:19,919
No, bingo. Look.

832
00:56:20,089 --> 00:56:22,922
- Nice call, Jessie.
- So, that's Jackie Legs.

833
00:56:23,092 --> 00:56:24,684
Kangaroo Jack in the flesh.

834
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:27,294
Can't get near him like that.
He'll take off running.

835
00:56:27,463 --> 00:56:29,090
So, what do we do?

836
00:56:29,265 --> 00:56:31,358
We have to disguise ourselves.

837
00:56:31,534 --> 00:56:33,092
Get rid of our human scent.

838
00:56:33,269 --> 00:56:35,760
And how are we going to do that?

839
00:56:42,445 --> 00:56:44,310
We need to get a little closer.

840
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:48,416
Now, the only time we move
is when he's feeding.

841
00:56:49,018 --> 00:56:53,648
This is very important. Don't make any
sudden movements or sounds.

842
00:56:53,823 --> 00:56:55,256
- Okay.
- Got it.

843
00:56:56,392 --> 00:56:57,416
There he goes.

844
00:57:09,972 --> 00:57:11,439
Shit!

845
00:57:11,607 --> 00:57:13,404
What is your problem?

846
00:57:13,576 --> 00:57:16,841
- I got ants crawling up my leg!
- Just ignore them!

847
00:57:17,012 --> 00:57:19,674
- I thought she said no sudden movements!
- Boys. Boys!

848
00:57:20,983 --> 00:57:22,245
Hello?

849
00:57:23,719 --> 00:57:27,120
- We're close enough. Spread out.
- Charlie.

850
00:57:28,224 --> 00:57:31,421
They're having a picnic in my shorts.
And I brought the sweets!

851
00:57:31,594 --> 00:57:34,188
- Louis, just keep it together!
- Okay!

852
00:57:34,363 --> 00:57:36,524
Keep it together, Louis!

853
00:57:37,399 --> 00:57:39,094
Keep it together.

854
00:57:57,319 --> 00:57:58,616
I can't take it no more!

855
00:57:58,787 --> 00:58:00,277
Oh, God!

856
00:58:05,094 --> 00:58:09,292
Get off! Get off me! Get off me!
I'm gonna roll in the grass!

857
00:58:09,465 --> 00:58:12,400
This is great! This is just great!
Now what are we gonna do?

858
00:58:12,568 --> 00:58:15,560
Well, there's no more we can do today.
We'll just have to wait.

859
00:58:15,738 --> 00:58:18,138
- I have an idea where they'll be tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

860
00:58:18,307 --> 00:58:20,036
No. This has gotta happen today.

861
00:58:20,209 --> 00:58:22,871
We'll pitch camp here.
I'll get the firewood.

862
00:58:24,146 --> 00:58:25,670
Oh, God.

863
00:58:26,682 --> 00:58:29,173
Hey, sorry about that, man.
I was under attack.

864
00:58:29,351 --> 00:58:32,718
That's all right. Look at her.
She thinks she's so much smarter than us.

865
00:58:33,222 --> 00:58:35,247
I'm pretty sure she is, Charlie.

866
00:58:36,692 --> 00:58:38,717
Let me ask you something, Mr. Jimmy.

867
00:58:39,662 --> 00:58:42,790
Where do I go if I'm looking
for a missing kangaroo?

868
00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:46,761
The sky is dry for many months.

869
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:51,729
- Wind is quiet from the...
- Kangaroos, Jim! Where are they?

870
00:58:52,374 --> 00:58:55,241
The best bet is right here. Owen Springs.

871
00:59:28,577 --> 00:59:29,635
What are you doing?

872
00:59:30,813 --> 00:59:32,804
Jessie! I was going to take a bath.

873
00:59:33,616 --> 00:59:34,640
Go!

874
00:59:36,418 --> 00:59:37,578
- Yes!
- No.

875
00:59:37,753 --> 00:59:41,348
Look, I'm hot, I'm filthy
and I wanna take a bath.

876
00:59:41,523 --> 00:59:44,185
You can stay, you can go,
it makes no difference to me.

877
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:47,887
- Well, I'm not leaving. I was here first.
- Suit yourself.

878
01:00:01,176 --> 01:00:02,609
It's gorgeous.

879
01:00:04,947 --> 01:00:06,642
Hey, what are looking at?

880
01:00:07,283 --> 01:00:09,945
- Well, you looked first.
- Yeah, I looked.

881
01:00:10,119 --> 01:00:12,383
So, I looked too, all right?

882
01:00:14,189 --> 01:00:15,747
Come near me, I'll kill you.

883
01:00:15,924 --> 01:00:17,653
So nervous.

884
01:00:18,193 --> 01:00:21,321
You have absolutely no effect on me.

885
01:00:21,497 --> 01:00:22,521
No?

886
01:00:22,698 --> 01:00:25,929
- You think you do.
- Just stating the obvious.

887
01:00:26,101 --> 01:00:30,333
You are so not my type! You could kiss me
and it wouldn't make the slightest...

888
01:00:35,144 --> 01:00:38,011
...difference.
- Nothing?

889
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:40,580
No. Sorry.

890
01:00:40,749 --> 01:00:45,186
Well, I hate break it to you, honey, but that
kiss did absolutely nothing for me, either.

891
01:00:45,354 --> 01:00:47,720
I'm not surprised,
if that's the best you can kiss.

892
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:50,051
You want to see the best I can kiss?

893
01:00:50,225 --> 01:00:52,455
As a matter of fact, I...

894
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:00,158
See?

895
01:01:00,869 --> 01:01:02,427
Nothing.

896
01:01:02,604 --> 01:01:04,003
Same here. Nothing.

897
01:01:04,173 --> 01:01:05,800
Really?

898
01:01:06,842 --> 01:01:09,367
All right, I'll admit it.

899
01:01:10,145 --> 01:01:15,640
This is the most sensual
romantic moment of my entire life.

900
01:01:23,992 --> 01:01:25,254
And now it's over.

901
01:01:39,775 --> 01:01:40,935
Hey, guys...

902
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:43,077
...I think it's time to get up.

903
01:01:45,514 --> 01:01:47,175
What's going on?

904
01:01:47,349 --> 01:01:50,250
- We're in a little bit of trouble.
- A little?

905
01:01:50,953 --> 01:01:55,549
I've been following camel tracks all bloody
morning, so let's make short work of this.

906
01:01:55,724 --> 01:01:57,555
Where's me moolah?

907
01:01:57,726 --> 01:02:00,718
For God's sakes!
All this over $4000?

908
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,163
It's more, isn't it?

909
01:02:07,302 --> 01:02:09,065
How much more?

910
01:02:09,238 --> 01:02:10,933
$46,000 more.

911
01:02:11,106 --> 01:02:13,267
And every cent of it is mine.

912
01:02:13,442 --> 01:02:15,273
Now, there are two ways of doing this.

913
01:02:15,444 --> 01:02:18,379
And one of them is a lot less painful
than the other.

914
01:02:19,948 --> 01:02:21,279
Where's the money?

915
01:02:23,352 --> 01:02:24,876
See, what happened was...

916
01:02:25,053 --> 01:02:27,078
...we was driving and we hit this kangaroo.

917
01:02:27,256 --> 01:02:29,383
- I was wearing my lucky jacket...
- Wrong answer.

918
01:02:29,558 --> 01:02:32,789
Your mate, Blue, told us
that yarn about the boomer.

919
01:02:34,229 --> 01:02:35,457
Mate.

920
01:02:35,631 --> 01:02:40,227
I hope for your sake you were stupid enough
to hide that money in them saddle bags.

921
01:02:40,402 --> 01:02:43,064
- You gotta believe us.
- No. You gotta believe me.

922
01:02:43,238 --> 01:02:47,834
If it ain't there, I'm gonna carve
you up piece by piece.

923
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:55,107
- It's safe to assume you're not on vacation.
- No.

924
01:02:55,784 --> 01:02:59,242
Charlie's stepfather is a mobster and
he sent us here to deliver a package.

925
01:02:59,421 --> 01:03:03,255
- And you got me into the middle of this?
- Sorry. I never thought this would happen.

926
01:03:04,393 --> 01:03:05,587
And you lied to me.

927
01:03:10,265 --> 01:03:11,926
What do you know!

928
01:03:12,935 --> 01:03:15,130
Bad news, fellas,
you were telling the truth.

929
01:03:16,772 --> 01:03:18,672
Who wants to go first?

930
01:03:21,743 --> 01:03:24,769
We can find your money.
If you kill us now, you'll never get it.

931
01:03:24,947 --> 01:03:28,678
- I'm listening.
- I know a feeding ground near Owen Springs.

932
01:03:28,851 --> 01:03:32,685
A eucalyptus grove a few kilometers
from here. That's where they'll be.

933
01:03:36,825 --> 01:03:39,350
I'll take the sheila and ride ahead.

934
01:03:39,528 --> 01:03:40,654
Jessie...

935
01:03:40,829 --> 01:03:42,160
I didn't do it for you.

936
01:03:45,868 --> 01:03:46,857
Listen up.

937
01:03:47,803 --> 01:03:52,536
Once we're out of sight, I want you to
take our friends out to Kings Canyon.

938
01:03:52,708 --> 01:03:56,439
You know what to do with them.
But don't go berko. Make it look natural.

939
01:03:56,612 --> 01:04:00,776
Two Yanks tragically karking it
in the unapologetic Outback.

940
01:04:04,987 --> 01:04:07,182
We're going in the wrong direction.

941
01:04:08,991 --> 01:04:11,892
- They're gonna kill us.
- God knows what they'll do to Jessie.

942
01:04:13,929 --> 01:04:16,227
I should have stopped this 20 years ago.

943
01:04:16,832 --> 01:04:18,060
What are you talking about?

944
01:04:18,233 --> 01:04:21,168
First time Sal came to my mother's
house, I knew he was no good.

945
01:04:21,336 --> 01:04:24,499
But he bought me this first baseman's mitt,
that Don Mattingly model.

946
01:04:24,673 --> 01:04:28,006
That was a great mitt.
I still feel bad about losing it.

947
01:04:28,176 --> 01:04:30,576
When he left, my mom asked me
what I thought of him.

948
01:04:30,746 --> 01:04:32,680
And I said, "I like him."

949
01:04:32,848 --> 01:04:35,908
I should have stood up to him
and thrown him out of my house.

950
01:04:36,084 --> 01:04:37,676
Charlie, you were 10.

951
01:04:37,853 --> 01:04:40,845
Sal was right, Louis.
I got chicken blood.

952
01:04:41,023 --> 01:04:43,082
I had it my whole life.

953
01:04:46,194 --> 01:04:47,593
But that stops right now.

954
01:04:48,463 --> 01:04:51,489
Louis, reach into my pants.

955
01:04:51,667 --> 01:04:56,366
Don't do this. Go out like a man.
Look, we all have urges.

956
01:04:56,538 --> 01:05:00,440
I remember this one time,
there was this well-built Latino...

957
01:05:00,609 --> 01:05:04,010
My scissors! Reach into my pants
and get my scissors.

958
01:05:04,179 --> 01:05:05,669
Okay.

959
01:05:07,883 --> 01:05:09,350
Okay, Louis.

960
01:05:09,952 --> 01:05:12,147
- Are you ready to go?
- You bet.

961
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:17,087
You think you can distract them?

962
01:05:17,259 --> 01:05:20,490
You mean, make them watch this hand
instead of this one?

963
01:05:21,063 --> 01:05:22,621
Piece of cake.

964
01:05:24,399 --> 01:05:25,957
Freeze, sucker!

965
01:05:27,402 --> 01:05:29,768
Get your hands up and turn slowly!

966
01:05:35,577 --> 01:05:37,204
I'm warning you!

967
01:05:37,379 --> 01:05:42,442
In 1983, I was the starting pitcher
in the Little League World Series.

968
01:05:43,518 --> 01:05:46,351
I struck out 16 Taiwanese All-Stars!

969
01:05:46,521 --> 01:05:51,049
To this day, the people of Asia
call me Sun Luc Dong...

970
01:05:51,226 --> 01:05:54,992
...which means big black man
pretending to be 12!

971
01:06:00,102 --> 01:06:04,004
My name's Carbone,
which means skinny white boy with a gun.

972
01:06:04,606 --> 01:06:07,336
Good work, Sun Luc Dong.

973
01:07:00,962 --> 01:07:02,190
You said they'd be here.

974
01:07:02,364 --> 01:07:05,094
You're trying to pull a swifty
and I don't much like that.

975
01:07:05,267 --> 01:07:07,895
There's also an area further along.

976
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:10,004
I'm tired of your howling.

977
01:07:11,807 --> 01:07:13,934
What in bloody...?

978
01:07:15,343 --> 01:07:17,243
Change of plans, Smith.

979
01:07:20,882 --> 01:07:23,510
Come on, you two.
Let's go. Let's go, come on.

980
01:07:25,353 --> 01:07:26,877
Jessie, come here.

981
01:07:27,055 --> 01:07:30,115
- Easy, darling.
- Drop the knife, Smith.

982
01:07:34,029 --> 01:07:37,089
You ever held a gun before, Charlie?

983
01:07:37,265 --> 01:07:38,596
Don't answer that.

984
01:07:39,601 --> 01:07:40,727
No.

985
01:07:42,304 --> 01:07:44,272
You ever killed a man, Charlie?

986
01:07:44,439 --> 01:07:45,804
Don't answer that.

987
01:07:46,808 --> 01:07:47,934
No.

988
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:52,378
What do you do for a living
that makes you so brave, Charlie?

989
01:07:52,547 --> 01:07:54,276
Really don't answer that.

990
01:07:58,086 --> 01:08:01,886
I'm a hairdresser.
Now, drop the knife.

991
01:08:03,024 --> 01:08:04,423
Come here, Jessie.

992
01:08:04,593 --> 01:08:06,618
Yeah! We bad.

993
01:08:08,930 --> 01:08:11,899
If you think you're off the hook
because you came back for me...

994
01:08:12,067 --> 01:08:13,295
Never crossed my mind.

995
01:08:16,171 --> 01:08:19,004
You better hope that's someone
coming to rescue you.

996
01:08:22,244 --> 01:08:23,575
Frankie!

997
01:08:24,179 --> 01:08:26,773
- What are you doing here?
- Sal heard you were having trouble...

998
01:08:26,948 --> 01:08:28,347
...so he sent us to help you out.

999
01:08:28,517 --> 01:08:31,281
- Who the hell are you?
- Frank Lombardo.

1000
01:08:31,453 --> 01:08:34,684
I represent the interests of Salvatore Maggio.

1001
01:08:34,856 --> 01:08:37,791
- You must be Smith.
- You're not wrong.

1002
01:08:39,027 --> 01:08:42,019
- What's going on here?
- These guys were trying to kill us.

1003
01:08:42,197 --> 01:08:45,132
Looks like we got here just in time.

1004
01:08:47,269 --> 01:08:49,032
You did good, kid.

1005
01:08:49,204 --> 01:08:52,901
Now, put that gun down
before you hurt yourself, all right?

1006
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:00,143
Wow, Frankie.

1007
01:09:00,315 --> 01:09:03,045
I never thought I'd be happy to see you.

1008
01:09:06,388 --> 01:09:08,822
Frankie, this is Jessie.
Jessie, this is Frankie.

1009
01:09:09,758 --> 01:09:12,158
- Hi.
- You see...

1010
01:09:12,327 --> 01:09:15,558
...Louis and I, we fell
a little behind schedule...

1011
01:09:15,730 --> 01:09:18,790
And Jessie came along and helped us
get back on schedule again.

1012
01:09:18,967 --> 01:09:20,992
And so, you know... Uh-oh.

1013
01:09:21,169 --> 01:09:22,966
I know all about it, Charlie.

1014
01:09:25,307 --> 01:09:27,434
So you know about Jackie Legs?

1015
01:09:27,609 --> 01:09:30,237
From Canarsie? He's involved in this?

1016
01:09:31,313 --> 01:09:34,544
No, you guys are so sneaky and clever,
I didn't know.

1017
01:09:34,716 --> 01:09:38,379
Hurricanes leave smaller trails
than you two morons.

1018
01:09:41,323 --> 01:09:45,054
Sal is very disappointed to hear
you lost that money.

1019
01:09:47,095 --> 01:09:48,426
We'll get the money back.

1020
01:09:48,597 --> 01:09:53,830
It's too late for that. This time you
screwed up big. Final straw big.

1021
01:09:54,002 --> 01:09:57,301
Enough of the claptrap.
That money is mine.

1022
01:09:57,472 --> 01:09:58,871
Zip the lip, Dundee.

1023
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:02,237
We had a contract
and it didn't involve no bloody roo.

1024
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:08,345
I had to come all the way down here
to the sphincter of the galaxy...

1025
01:10:08,516 --> 01:10:11,610
...to straighten out this
puked-up fur ball of a mess.

1026
01:10:11,786 --> 01:10:14,084
- Do not agitate me.
- We had a contract!

1027
01:10:14,256 --> 01:10:17,020
Do not agitate me!

1028
01:10:33,208 --> 01:10:34,436
Let's get out of here.

1029
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:41,142
Jessie, get as far away
from here as you can.

1030
01:10:41,316 --> 01:10:42,783
They're not after you.

1031
01:10:42,951 --> 01:10:44,748
Louis, we gotta get the money.

1032
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:47,582
We drive the roo into the canyon,
we can corner him there.

1033
01:10:47,756 --> 01:10:49,553
- We?
- We did have a deal.

1034
01:11:00,835 --> 01:11:02,132
Enough!

1035
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:06,832
Contract terminated.

1036
01:11:07,008 --> 01:11:08,339
Get in the car!

1037
01:11:13,248 --> 01:11:15,944
- There he goes!
- Turn him into the canyon!

1038
01:11:23,725 --> 01:11:24,851
Frankie!

1039
01:11:39,541 --> 01:11:41,168
Come on!

1040
01:11:42,377 --> 01:11:43,708
We got them!

1041
01:11:53,254 --> 01:11:55,449
Shoot at them, you idiot!

1042
01:11:57,459 --> 01:11:59,620
I could've stayed in Brooklyn for this!

1043
01:12:02,530 --> 01:12:03,690
Come on, baby!

1044
01:12:08,303 --> 01:12:09,600
Hold on!

1045
01:12:16,411 --> 01:12:18,345
I hate this country like a sickness!

1046
01:12:21,049 --> 01:12:22,482
Not me! Them!

1047
01:12:24,753 --> 01:12:25,742
My bad.

1048
01:12:28,656 --> 01:12:29,748
Bad brats!

1049
01:12:29,924 --> 01:12:32,415
- Get the dumb thing out of my face!
- I got it!

1050
01:12:34,062 --> 01:12:35,620
Watch your head!

1051
01:12:36,364 --> 01:12:38,594
- Watch out!
- For what?

1052
01:12:47,075 --> 01:12:48,406
Tight fit!

1053
01:12:49,544 --> 01:12:50,704
Crap!

1054
01:13:09,130 --> 01:13:11,690
- Louis, he's coming to you!
- Go get him, big guy!

1055
01:13:12,434 --> 01:13:15,460
I'm gonna get that money, Charlie!
I'm going for the money!

1056
01:13:17,338 --> 01:13:18,999
Oh, my God!

1057
01:13:21,342 --> 01:13:23,401
- Louis!
- Watch out!

1058
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:27,777
Louis, no!

1059
01:13:27,949 --> 01:13:29,746
Stay still, Jackie Legs!

1060
01:13:31,953 --> 01:13:33,784
Yeah, I got it! I got it!

1061
01:13:33,955 --> 01:13:36,719
- I got the money!
- Louis!

1062
01:13:43,531 --> 01:13:45,294
Louis!

1063
01:13:45,934 --> 01:13:48,095
Hurry, Charlie!

1064
01:13:48,269 --> 01:13:50,328
I'm slipping, Charlie!

1065
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:54,173
Charlie!

1066
01:13:54,676 --> 01:13:56,303
Louis, grab my hand.

1067
01:13:56,478 --> 01:13:57,945
Louis!

1068
01:14:01,516 --> 01:14:03,347
- Charlie!
- Hold on, Louis!

1069
01:14:05,653 --> 01:14:06,915
Give me your belt!

1070
01:14:07,088 --> 01:14:08,419
You'll be all right!

1071
01:14:08,590 --> 01:14:09,716
Charlie!

1072
01:14:09,891 --> 01:14:11,449
Grab that rope. Grab that rope!

1073
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:20,092
Charlie!

1074
01:14:21,236 --> 01:14:22,794
Grab the belt, Louis.

1075
01:14:26,007 --> 01:14:27,975
I can't reach it, Charlie!

1076
01:14:28,143 --> 01:14:30,634
Grab the damn belt!

1077
01:14:32,780 --> 01:14:33,974
It's now or never, Louis!

1078
01:14:41,589 --> 01:14:43,181
- Pull me up!
- Louis.

1079
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:48,554
You have really got to cut back on the pie!

1080
01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:50,925
Don't you let me go, Charlie!

1081
01:14:51,099 --> 01:14:52,157
Don't you let me go!

1082
01:14:53,334 --> 01:14:55,165
Go, go, go! Up, up!

1083
01:14:55,336 --> 01:14:57,395
Pull, Jessie. A little more!

1084
01:14:57,572 --> 01:14:59,335
Come on, Louis!
Jessie, a little more!

1085
01:14:59,507 --> 01:15:00,838
Come on!

1086
01:15:02,043 --> 01:15:04,409
Charlie! I'm slipping!

1087
01:15:17,258 --> 01:15:19,556
I'm gonna name my first son after you.

1088
01:15:21,129 --> 01:15:23,188
"Crazy-Ass White Boy."

1089
01:15:31,139 --> 01:15:32,436
Let go of me!

1090
01:15:33,274 --> 01:15:34,901
Let go of me!

1091
01:15:37,445 --> 01:15:39,072
This is from Sal Maggio.

1092
01:15:39,247 --> 01:15:42,011
Frankie, we got the money back.
We got it back!

1093
01:15:43,551 --> 01:15:44,950
We got it!

1094
01:15:45,119 --> 01:15:47,587
You don't get it, do you, Charlie?

1095
01:15:47,755 --> 01:15:50,485
Sal's not disappointed because
he cares about the money.

1096
01:15:50,658 --> 01:15:54,219
He's disappointed because
you two aren't dead!

1097
01:15:55,930 --> 01:15:59,195
What do you think he was paying
Smith 50 grand for?

1098
01:16:02,170 --> 01:16:05,799
We traveled halfway across the world
to pay for our own execution?

1099
01:16:05,974 --> 01:16:10,308
Yeah, you two guys were
the bagmen for your own hit.

1100
01:16:10,478 --> 01:16:12,469
Pretty clever.

1101
01:16:12,647 --> 01:16:14,046
Not on our part.

1102
01:16:14,949 --> 01:16:15,973
Say good night.

1103
01:16:24,659 --> 01:16:28,390
This is Senior Sergeant
Jimmy Inkamala, Australian Police.

1104
01:16:28,563 --> 01:16:32,021
- Mr. Jimmy?
- Drop your weapon and...

1105
01:16:44,212 --> 01:16:47,477
Hey, Frankie! Go long!

1106
01:17:02,096 --> 01:17:05,964
- I am bolo man.
- That's what I'm talking about.

1107
01:17:10,004 --> 01:17:14,270
Yes, Mr. Smith was one of our
most notorious contract killers.

1108
01:17:14,442 --> 01:17:19,004
We got a tip from the FBI that he was
involved with the Maggio family.

1109
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:23,082
Yeah, and when Frankie Lombardo called
looking for a guide, I was waiting.

1110
01:17:23,251 --> 01:17:24,718
I'm just glad I made it in time.

1111
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:29,256
You pansy-ass retards are dead!
You hear me? Dead!

1112
01:17:29,424 --> 01:17:32,825
I'll slaughter you like veal!
I'll wear your eyeballs like jewelry!

1113
01:17:32,994 --> 01:17:36,486
I've always found the Brooklyn
vernacular fascinating.

1114
01:17:39,167 --> 01:17:40,657
Quite colorful, really.

1115
01:17:40,835 --> 01:17:44,601
Hey, Frankie?
Can I have your Yankees tickets?

1116
01:17:51,913 --> 01:17:54,438
There you are! They were full.

1117
01:17:54,615 --> 01:17:57,948
They're radioing Alice Springs
to send another chopper for us.

1118
01:17:58,853 --> 01:18:00,343
What's up, man?

1119
01:18:04,258 --> 01:18:05,452
Charlie.

1120
01:18:07,495 --> 01:18:10,896
Something really important
happened here today.

1121
01:18:11,833 --> 01:18:14,063
You saved my life.

1122
01:18:14,335 --> 01:18:17,896
- Yeah, I know. So now we're even.
- Exactly.

1123
01:18:18,072 --> 01:18:20,563
You don't owe me anymore.
You're rid of me.

1124
01:18:20,742 --> 01:18:22,573
What are you talking about,
I'm rid of you?

1125
01:18:22,744 --> 01:18:26,578
Come on, Charlie, guilt was the glue
that held this friendship together.

1126
01:18:26,914 --> 01:18:30,315
- You never needed me.
- You're wrong, Louis.

1127
01:18:30,485 --> 01:18:31,577
I've always needed you.

1128
01:18:35,256 --> 01:18:38,089
You know when you call me up,
and you're, like:

1129
01:18:38,259 --> 01:18:41,456
"Yo, Charlie, you gotta help me drive
some greyhounds up from Florida."

1130
01:18:41,696 --> 01:18:44,665
And I make out like I'm doing you
this big favor?

1131
01:18:45,099 --> 01:18:48,330
Truth is, you're doing me the favor.

1132
01:18:48,503 --> 01:18:54,738
Every story in my life worth telling
starts with the words Louis and I.

1133
01:18:55,410 --> 01:18:58,208
Come on, get away from me
with that, man.

1134
01:19:02,683 --> 01:19:05,846
You think we're friends
because you saved my life once?

1135
01:19:07,221 --> 01:19:10,156
You save my life every day, Louis.

1136
01:19:17,365 --> 01:19:19,162
Come on, man.

1137
01:19:20,835 --> 01:19:22,598
Guys?

1138
01:19:23,137 --> 01:19:25,196
Can you hold on a second?

1139
01:19:25,373 --> 01:19:28,706
We're having a very intimate,
non-gay moment.

1140
01:19:28,876 --> 01:19:30,503
Take a look.

1141
01:19:39,187 --> 01:19:41,212
- What are you doing?
- Hello, Jackie Legs.

1142
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:54,166
Here you go, boy. Here you go. Yeah.

1143
01:19:54,335 --> 01:19:56,030
That's a boy.

1144
01:19:56,704 --> 01:19:59,867
Good boy. Here you are.

1145
01:20:00,341 --> 01:20:02,935
Hey, there, little guy. Yeah.

1146
01:20:04,011 --> 01:20:05,478
There you go.

1147
01:20:06,747 --> 01:20:11,013
It's okay. It's okay.
Let me just grab this.

1148
01:20:11,185 --> 01:20:14,450
There you are. Good boy.

1149
01:20:14,622 --> 01:20:16,351
There you go.

1150
01:20:33,407 --> 01:20:35,272
So long, Jackie Legs.

1151
01:20:40,181 --> 01:20:43,014
Hey, would you look at that?

1152
01:20:43,184 --> 01:20:47,086
- Louis, your lucky jacket.
- I don't think so!

1153
01:20:47,255 --> 01:20:50,122
Hear me out. If you hadn't
put the money in the jacket...

1154
01:20:50,291 --> 01:20:51,883
...and the jacket on the kangaroo...

1155
01:20:52,059 --> 01:20:55,153
...we would've delivered the money
to Smith and he would've killed us.

1156
01:20:55,329 --> 01:20:56,819
Your lucky jacket.

1157
01:20:58,466 --> 01:21:02,061
Gimme my jacket! I told you. Didn't I
tell you this was my lucky jacket?

1158
01:21:07,708 --> 01:21:10,404
Look, Louis, he's back.

1159
01:21:11,078 --> 01:21:13,308
And he's got a family.

1160
01:21:16,183 --> 01:21:22,315
Hey, you must be Jackie Junior.
You're a cute little guy, aren't you?

1161
01:21:28,162 --> 01:21:29,652
Oh, my God! Are you all right?!

1162
01:21:36,637 --> 01:21:38,298
<i>So, that's my story.</i>

1163
01:21:38,472 --> 01:21:40,337
<i>Well, not quite.</i>

1164
01:21:40,508 --> 01:21:42,442
<i>Frankie and his goons</i>
<i>were put away for good.</i>

1165
01:21:43,811 --> 01:21:47,577
<i>As for Sal, he used all his high</i>- <i>level</i>
<i>connections to avoid going to prison.</i>

1166
01:21:47,748 --> 01:21:48,908
<i>And you know what?</i>

1167
01:21:51,285 --> 01:21:52,479
<i>It wasn't enough.</i>

1168
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:56,412
<i>Jessie? She ended up marrying</i>
<i>some filthy</i>- <i>rich tycoon.</i>

1169
01:21:56,591 --> 01:21:57,853
Hey, honey.

1170
01:21:58,292 --> 01:21:59,316
Hi, honey.

1171
01:21:59,493 --> 01:22:02,690
<i>Yep, the filthy</i>- <i>rich dude, that's me.</i>

1172
01:22:02,863 --> 01:22:04,888
<i>Louis and I used the 50 grand</i>
<i>as startup money.</i>

1173
01:22:05,066 --> 01:22:08,058
<i>And now Snakeskin Lily Berry</i>
<i>Shampoo...</i>

1174
01:22:08,235 --> 01:22:10,863
<i>... is the biggest thing</i>
<i>since Vidal Sassoon.</i>

1175
01:22:11,038 --> 01:22:13,836
Got the latest numbers in from Europe.
Think you'll like them.

1176
01:22:14,008 --> 01:22:15,669
I love numbers.

1177
01:22:15,843 --> 01:22:18,368
Hey, partner? I got the new numbers.

1178
01:22:20,114 --> 01:22:22,480
Partner? Partner?

1179
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:24,880
Look out below!

1180
01:22:37,298 --> 01:22:40,199
- Louis!
- Just trying my newest idea:

1181
01:22:40,368 --> 01:22:43,633
Waterproof mousse! How do you like it?

1182
01:22:48,209 --> 01:22:49,699
<i>So that's me, Charlie Carbone.</i>

1183
01:22:49,877 --> 01:22:52,846
<i>The one with the beautiful girl,</i>
<i>all the money I could ever want...</i>

1184
01:22:53,014 --> 01:22:54,811
<i>... and my best friend Louis...</i>

1185
01:22:54,982 --> 01:22:58,816
<i>... who saved my life more times</i>
<i>than he'll ever know.</i>

1186
01:23:12,533 --> 01:23:13,693
Wait a minute!

1187
01:23:13,868 --> 01:23:18,066
The movie is called <i>Kangaroo Jack</i>!
It should end with me!

1188
01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:21,402
I'm a serious,
classically trained actor!

1189
01:23:21,742 --> 01:23:25,303
I can sing, I can dance and I can jump
out of the way of explosions.

1190
01:23:25,479 --> 01:23:27,379
Yeah, no, that gonna leave a mark.

1191
01:23:27,715 --> 01:23:29,546
And I can do impersonations.

1192
01:23:29,917 --> 01:23:32,784
Come on, people.
Throw me a freaking bone.

1193
01:23:32,953 --> 01:23:37,014
I have a son.
I shall call him Mini-Roo.

1194
01:23:37,425 --> 01:23:41,589
Now, that should be the way you
end a film. With the star.

1195
01:23:41,762 --> 01:23:43,127
Someone call my agent!

1196
01:23:45,066 --> 01:23:47,296
That's all, blokes!
