1
00:00:49,544 --> 00:00:51,601
<i>Do you guys want to do it over there?
Do you wanna ...</i>

2
00:00:52,538 --> 00:00:54,805
<i>My representation is that we
move over here...</i>

3
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:55,589
<i>Okay.</i>

4
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,498
<i> Can we do it or not?</i>

5
00:00:57,499 --> 00:00:59,835
<i>No, not at the corner over there.</i>

6
00:00:59,836 --> 00:01:02,218
<i>The way the sun is right now,
will be really great.</i>

7
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,448
<i>I mean, is there a way we
could face this direction...</i>

8
00:01:06,706 --> 00:01:09,860
<i>Do you have anything particular in
mind that you want to do this year?</i>

9
00:01:10,061 --> 00:01:11,374
<i>Don't ask me.</i>

10
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:12,556
<i>Don't ask you, huh.</i>

11
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:15,804
<i>Scott, you don't see
the swing set, do you?</i>

12
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:19,338
<i>Do you see the swing set at all?
I don't want that, in front, at all.</i>

13
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:21,581
<i>The swing, not at all.</i>

14
00:01:23,122 --> 00:01:26,653
<i>That doesn't look like
a life, kid, how about it? ...</i>

15
00:01:29,171 --> 00:01:31,124
<i>Hey again, do you
want to do the job, anyone?</i>

16
00:01:32,164 --> 00:01:35,413
<i>You're not gonna get the flash
in Keith's eye glasses are you?</i>

17
00:01:35,504 --> 00:01:38,481
<i>No. .. actually... </i>

18
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:51,052
<i>I like when you're comfortable in that...
that's such a great shot.</i>

19
00:01:51,053 --> 00:01:53,880
<i>- I hate you.
- All right.</i>

20
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:57,240
- Tell you what. Be comfortable, now.
- Because you're a natural.

21
00:02:49,182 --> 00:02:50,782
Hi!

22
00:02:51,387 --> 00:02:54,207
- What are you doing?
- Really boring work.

23
00:02:54,366 --> 00:02:56,212
Do you feel like
making us lunch instead?

24
00:02:56,966 --> 00:03:00,129
- What do you want?
- Um, tuna rolls.

25
00:03:00,684 --> 00:03:03,500
We will right outside,
near the arrival,

26
00:03:03,501 --> 00:03:05,636
right after she come
through passports changed.

27
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:10,818
Ok . Yeah.
Yes, we have a piano.

28
00:03:11,305 --> 00:03:12,610
She gonna plays piano.

29
00:03:13,352 --> 00:03:18,690
Okay, great.
Okay, alright, bye-bye.

30
00:03:20,205 --> 00:03:24,012
- She's actually coming?
- Yes, she's actually coming.

31
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:26,350
Coming in a couple of days .

32
00:03:27,715 --> 00:03:30,384
And the school is
week after next, so ...

33
00:03:31,515 --> 00:03:34,169
should be here, ready to go,
get everything in place.

34
00:03:35,112 --> 00:03:37,130
How to settle in,
should be enough time.

35
00:03:37,131 --> 00:03:39,083
You know I've got my
audition coming up, right.

36
00:03:39,084 --> 00:03:40,192
You'll be fine?

37
00:03:40,193 --> 00:03:41,639
I know my audition,
I've got to practice.

38
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,253
You can still practice.
She's not going to disturb you.

39
00:03:44,632 --> 00:03:48,159
You can stay up in your room and
practice, you can practice at school,

40
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,985
or you can practice out in the garage,
most of the places you can practice.

41
00:03:50,986 --> 00:03:52,041
It's not about ...

42
00:03:53,306 --> 00:03:55,385
Look, it's going to be great.

43
00:03:55,994 --> 00:03:58,351
And we're gonna be
very welcoming and kind.

44
00:03:58,554 --> 00:04:00,690
Are you going to be the
one babysitting or anything....

45
00:04:00,714 --> 00:04:03,184
You're not babysitting her,
she's not a child.

46
00:04:03,606 --> 00:04:05,605
She's actually older than
you by a couple of months.

47
00:04:05,606 --> 00:04:07,506
She is 18 already.

48
00:04:08,006 --> 00:04:09,591
It's a wonderful program.

49
00:04:09,592 --> 00:04:12,263
I am not gonna want to go away
from my final semester in high school.

50
00:04:12,298 --> 00:04:15,134
And Seebecks have a really
wonderful  student they got from France.

51
00:04:15,607 --> 00:04:16,612
He's from Paris.

52
00:04:16,613 --> 00:04:19,146
I'm just worried about the
stresses you have in your life,

53
00:04:19,147 --> 00:04:20,489
having to drive all of us around.

54
00:04:20,506 --> 00:04:22,605
There's no stress in my life.
I like driving everybody.

55
00:04:22,606 --> 00:04:24,946
Well, maybe I should .... get a car.

56
00:04:29,847 --> 00:04:31,870
I mean ... she can stay in my room.

57
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:33,656
We got to get another car.

58
00:04:34,486 --> 00:04:37,328
We have a car.
We have a nice Jeep.

59
00:04:42,007 --> 00:04:45,914
Did any of you just sent out,
like a, an email for this letter.

60
00:04:47,238 --> 00:04:50,649
This shows...
that we care.

61
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,844
- You got anything better than that?
- No.

62
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:57,586
I mean, if I got into Stanford or Berkeley,
and especially if the offer is better...

63
00:04:57,887 --> 00:04:59,476
Yeah, exactly.

64
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:01,805
Obviously I will work
really, really hard.

65
00:05:01,807 --> 00:05:04,731
And achieve swimming excellence.

66
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,064
Gosh.  I'm  getting
very nervous now!

67
00:05:09,492 --> 00:05:11,638
- Just relax.
- Stop it.

68
00:05:13,565 --> 00:05:15,032
It's always getting over me.

69
00:05:17,647 --> 00:05:19,369
Stop. That's going over.

70
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,985
Yeah, that is okay.

71
00:05:22,401 --> 00:05:24,824
Look at that.
Precision and skill.

72
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:25,967
Good.

73
00:05:30,616 --> 00:05:31,566
Quack, quack.

74
00:05:32,907 --> 00:05:35,862
You wanna clean all this
up too before she comes?

75
00:05:35,897 --> 00:05:37,060
Yeah. I was going to.

76
00:05:37,743 --> 00:05:39,173
Hold on tight.

77
00:05:43,808 --> 00:05:46,181
Ok ... alright.
Now what about all this?

78
00:05:47,508 --> 00:05:48,822
I am going to do it later.

79
00:05:48,857 --> 00:05:50,883
No no... let's do it now.

80
00:05:56,108 --> 00:05:59,174
- Looks good.
- Thanks for sharing your room.

81
00:06:06,465 --> 00:06:07,916
This is your flight ?

82
00:06:11,518 --> 00:06:13,560
Oh yes, Sophie !

83
00:06:14,067 --> 00:06:15,090
Hi !

84
00:06:15,468 --> 00:06:16,409
Sophie.

85
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,363
- Hello!
- Welcome.

86
00:06:19,127 --> 00:06:21,439
- How are you?
- I'm great. How are you feeling?

87
00:06:21,766 --> 00:06:22,842
This is Keith.

88
00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:24,818
Hi.
I 'm Sophie.

89
00:06:25,008 --> 00:06:26,809
- How was the flight ?
- Good, thank you.

90
00:06:27,204 --> 00:06:28,306
Very good.

91
00:06:29,628 --> 00:06:31,268
Wow ...
Okay.

92
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:34,343
- How are you?
- Good, good !

93
00:06:36,609 --> 00:06:38,726
Have you been to
Manhattan before?

94
00:06:38,761 --> 00:06:39,717
No, I haven't.

95
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:42,186
- You've never been to New York, right?
- Never.

96
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:48,311
- How far are we from New York?
- By car, we need about an hour and a half.

97
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,722
Keith goes in.
Just have snow ... right?

98
00:06:50,884 --> 00:06:52,133
Yeah. I'm the fastest.

99
00:06:53,694 --> 00:06:55,169
Here Keith's your piano teacher.

100
00:06:57,057 --> 00:06:58,812
- Oh, for the class.
- Yeah.

101
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:02,849
Keith teaches piano and
then other than teaching

102
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,612
he has a hobby
with the Symphony.

103
00:07:04,647 --> 00:07:07,093
- He plays with them...
- It's not a hobby.

104
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,851
What do you call it?
A part-time job ?

105
00:07:11,886 --> 00:07:13,648
Yes, part-time job.

106
00:07:13,772 --> 00:07:15,054
Part-time job...

107
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,359
- What's your instrument?
- I play cello.

108
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,427
But I sub for ... the NYNSO.

109
00:07:30,094 --> 00:07:32,257
But if I'm auditioning so...

110
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,219
there is a chair that is
supposedly bringing up soon.

111
00:07:37,461 --> 00:07:40,545
So would you give up teaching?

112
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:42,010
Yeah..

113
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,211
Nooo...

114
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:04,477
Welcome !

115
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:05,809
This is it!

116
00:08:12,611 --> 00:08:14,350
It's a little stuffy in here.

117
00:08:14,351 --> 00:08:16,325
Come on in.
I'll give you a little tour.

118
00:08:16,326 --> 00:08:17,226
Okay.

119
00:08:17,227 --> 00:08:18,327
This is a

120
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:23,172
sitting room... and
oh, this is for you.

121
00:08:23,201 --> 00:08:25,838
- A treat.
- Thank you.

122
00:08:26,961 --> 00:08:29,761
This is a little guide, Sophie's guide.

123
00:08:29,796 --> 00:08:34,501
Just a little, you know
information, coffee shop.

124
00:08:35,095 --> 00:08:37,429
It's a map. Oh, this is the school.
This is the map of the school.

125
00:08:37,552 --> 00:08:40,012
All right, when school starts,
I'll pick everybody up.

126
00:08:40,361 --> 00:08:41,732
There's the family, now.

127
00:08:42,812 --> 00:08:47,638
And I collect cookie jars,
and there are ones that I sell.

128
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,856
- Oh yeah...
- I find a lot of them online now.

129
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:53,479
This is the only one in service.

130
00:08:53,711 --> 00:08:55,438
The rest are empty.

131
00:08:55,762 --> 00:08:58,011
Hey, don't tell Keith and Laurie,
they don't know.

132
00:08:58,012 --> 00:09:00,904
Thank you.
It's my secret stash.

133
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:50,243
Would you like any lemonade or honey?

134
00:09:50,503 --> 00:09:53,362
- No thank you.
- You sure? How's the jet lag?

135
00:09:53,363 --> 00:09:54,262
It's fine.

136
00:09:54,313 --> 00:09:55,162
Ok...

137
00:11:34,115 --> 00:11:35,515
- Hi!
- Hi!

138
00:11:35,615 --> 00:11:37,770
- How are you?
- Okay thanks, how are you?

139
00:11:37,805 --> 00:11:40,081
- Good, I'm Lauren.
- I'm Sophie.

140
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,141
Nice to meet you.

141
00:11:42,215 --> 00:11:45,525
- How was your flight?
- Yah, it was very easy.

142
00:11:45,717 --> 00:11:47,723
So where are you from?
Are you from London?

143
00:11:48,065 --> 00:11:49,674
I live in Barkshire.

144
00:11:49,935 --> 00:11:52,526
- So do you go into London a lot?
- Yup. Yeah.

145
00:11:52,527 --> 00:11:54,335
- Is it a cool city?
- It 's lovely.

146
00:11:54,534 --> 00:11:55,408
I've never been.

147
00:11:56,431 --> 00:11:58,779
So you're excited to be here for ...?

148
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,366
Yeah! I guess. So much ...

149
00:12:02,048 --> 00:12:06,677
Yeah, I've been wanting to come
out to ... be in the States for ages.

150
00:12:06,896 --> 00:12:10,836
I've just been trying to think
about what I want to do and ...

151
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:14,110
I guess I don't really know yet.

152
00:12:14,016 --> 00:12:15,415
Yeah...

153
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:17,511
Um, do you do any sports?

154
00:12:17,935 --> 00:12:19,176
Nope...

155
00:12:19,316 --> 00:12:21,016
Well, I can swim, but not like you.

156
00:12:21,716 --> 00:12:22,755
Yeah...

157
00:12:23,948 --> 00:12:26,487
Oh, Keith play the guitar,
he was in a band.

158
00:12:27,684 --> 00:12:29,263
The Unconscious Brothers.

159
00:12:31,266 --> 00:12:33,598
- It's a brass band.
- It's a great name.

160
00:12:34,316 --> 00:12:37,676
- We got out of the garage.
- We got out of the garage but...

161
00:12:37,711 --> 00:12:39,730
I don't play with the
Unconscious Brothers any more.

162
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:44,090
That would be...
I haven't quite decide yet...

163
00:12:47,716 --> 00:12:50,981
Anyway, in a couple of days we're
having one of the cookie jar expos.

164
00:12:51,367 --> 00:12:53,666
I have two more boxes that
are supposed to be coming.

165
00:12:53,766 --> 00:12:56,474
Two more cookie jars
or boxes of cookie jars?

166
00:12:56,816 --> 00:12:59,115
Two more boxes of cookie jars.

167
00:12:59,116 --> 00:13:01,120
How many cookie jars
are there in total?

168
00:13:01,066 --> 00:13:02,812
No, there's only seven.

169
00:13:02,813 --> 00:13:06,053
But anyway it's going to be
really busy ... with this one.

170
00:13:06,054 --> 00:13:08,960
So when you're free you just
roam around and you know ...

171
00:13:08,961 --> 00:13:10,061
Okay.

172
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:34,326
Do you know what pieces
you're going to audition with?

173
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:36,325
Huh?

174
00:13:37,153 --> 00:13:38,311
Sorry...

175
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:42,412
- Don't want to disturb you.
- No, it's ok. I'm just taking a break.

176
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:46,874
So do you get nervous?

177
00:13:48,472 --> 00:13:49,613
With what?

178
00:13:50,677 --> 00:13:53,327
- Before the audition.
- No.

179
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,418
I mean...

180
00:13:56,698 --> 00:13:57,816
No, not really.

181
00:13:58,618 --> 00:14:00,706
You play long enough,
it doesn't affect you.

182
00:14:05,518 --> 00:14:09,459
Apparently Lawrence Olivier used
to vomit before every performance.

183
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,906
Lawrence Olivier...

184
00:14:11,658 --> 00:14:13,212
Who told you that?

185
00:14:14,219 --> 00:14:19,500
Can't remember. But I guess the point is,
even the best of the best get nervous.

186
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:24,451
Good night.

187
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:29,338
Good night !

188
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:45,282
- Hi!
- Hey! How are you. Nice to see you.

189
00:14:45,283 --> 00:14:45,860
Good.

190
00:14:46,058 --> 00:14:47,735
- Exchange student?
- Oh, yes.

191
00:14:47,736 --> 00:14:49,481
- This is Sophie.
- Sophie!

192
00:14:49,482 --> 00:14:50,313
<i>You know my family school?</i>

193
00:14:50,314 --> 00:14:52,182
Hi! Aaron.
Hi, nice to meet you Sophie.

194
00:14:53,215 --> 00:14:55,883
- How you enjoying yourself so far?
- Good.

195
00:14:56,218 --> 00:14:59,493
- You staying here for how long?
- For this semester.

196
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,406
- The whole thing?
- Yeah.

197
00:15:01,619 --> 00:15:04,301
- We got to party!
- We will party!

198
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:08,816
Yeah, but let's go early so that we can
get the sunset and making a bonfire there.

199
00:15:09,219 --> 00:15:10,869
Oh, it's going to be ....

200
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:18,121
- Okay. Bye!
- Bye bye.

201
00:15:18,136 --> 00:15:19,490
- Nice meeting you !
- And you.

202
00:15:19,492 --> 00:15:21,127
See you later Sophie and Lauren!

203
00:15:21,936 --> 00:15:23,643
- That's Aaron...
- Yeah.

204
00:15:24,678 --> 00:15:29,976
- So... you guys going out?
- No... He's like a ...

205
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,464
- friend.
- Yeah.

206
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:34,724
Vanessa...

207
00:15:35,886 --> 00:15:37,399
Alexy, hello.

208
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,430
Sophie Williams.

209
00:15:40,395 --> 00:15:44,419
Ha, you made it, you
decided to show up. That's ok.

210
00:15:45,813 --> 00:15:47,230
Sophie Williams.

211
00:15:51,102 --> 00:15:55,572
Back in school.
That's where we want to be.

212
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,509
Oh, before we start, I'm playing
this evening with the NYNSO.

213
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,719
As you know, I do
sometimes. I sub with them.

214
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,790
So, anybody who wants
to feel more cultured

215
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:08,031
or... wants to suck
up to the teacher.

216
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,940
By all means feel
free to come along.

217
00:16:10,947 --> 00:16:13,632
If you bring a ticket stub
or, program or something

218
00:16:13,633 --> 00:16:15,861
then I know you've been
and you'll get extra points.

219
00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:18,055
We've been practicing.

220
00:16:20,561 --> 00:16:22,268
Chloe, why don't you go first?

221
00:16:25,747 --> 00:16:27,723
Let me guess,
something by Bach, right?

222
00:16:35,914 --> 00:16:36,913
Sophie !

223
00:16:37,516 --> 00:16:40,690
You missed my class.
Any reason for this?

224
00:16:40,691 --> 00:16:42,704
I'm not be taking your class, Sir.

225
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:44,273
You're not going to take the class?

226
00:16:44,908 --> 00:16:46,002
Why not?

227
00:16:48,045 --> 00:16:50,184
I 've just been
thinking about that and ...

228
00:16:51,102 --> 00:16:54,760
I just don't think it's gonna
be the right thing for me to do.

229
00:16:54,761 --> 00:16:56,090
You just changed your mind.

230
00:16:56,591 --> 00:17:00,111
Ok, well look. You still need to come
until your name is taken off the roster.

231
00:17:00,112 --> 00:17:02,048
We have to talk to
Mr. Deacons, and get it arranged.

232
00:17:02,049 --> 00:17:03,297
We have to get your name taken off.

233
00:17:03,298 --> 00:17:07,229
I spoke with Mr Deacons this morning
and I made sure that it was okay.

234
00:17:10,322 --> 00:17:13,260
Well, you still need to come up until
he takes your name off the roster.

235
00:17:13,295 --> 00:17:15,856
Might take him a day or
two to get it arranged and ...

236
00:17:15,857 --> 00:17:17,646
He said it would be taken off tonight.

237
00:17:20,732 --> 00:17:23,648
He says a lot of things
that don't necessarily happen.

238
00:17:26,117 --> 00:17:28,336
Ok. If it's not arranged for tomorrow

239
00:17:28,337 --> 00:17:30,152
then just come to the class
and it'll be arranged soon.

240
00:17:30,153 --> 00:17:32,516
Ok. But if it's not, I'll wait.

241
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,594
Don't be late.

242
00:18:26,423 --> 00:18:28,978
- So... what you just did...
- I'm sorry...

243
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,444
Sorry ...
Megan and Lauren are waiting outside.

244
00:18:34,424 --> 00:18:36,389
Oh... I got to go.

245
00:18:37,623 --> 00:18:39,647
Your improvement is great.

246
00:18:39,682 --> 00:18:40,796
Well, thank you.

247
00:18:55,799 --> 00:19:00,557
Ok... well we just left.
Should you want to come by in 10?

248
00:19:00,826 --> 00:19:02,119
Ok...

249
00:19:02,334 --> 00:19:05,285
Come by in 10.
Perfect, thanks.

250
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,338
Bye!

251
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:14,340
- You sure you don't want to come?
- I think I might just stay here.

252
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:20,350
Are you sure? There is like,
lots of drinking and a lovely bonfire.

253
00:19:21,688 --> 00:19:24,689
No... I think I'll just take it easy.

254
00:19:25,034 --> 00:19:27,639
Ok... Have a good
night with your book.

255
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,121
Damon Culver.

256
00:19:29,474 --> 00:19:32,202
- What?
- It's the writer.

257
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,637
- Bye!
- Bye Lauren.

258
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,587
- Turkeys.
- Shall we?

259
00:19:46,588 --> 00:19:47,885
- How you doing?
- Good.

260
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,162
- All right? It's this weekend, right?
- Yeah.

261
00:19:55,425 --> 00:19:56,552
If I turn up.

262
00:19:58,124 --> 00:20:03,705
I can remember my last audition,
with Barenboim, there's a haze of ...

263
00:20:03,706 --> 00:20:06,506
Well, that's the thing, I can't
remember mine, either. It was years ago.

264
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:09,420
- You're not really worried, are you?
- No, no, no.

265
00:20:09,525 --> 00:20:11,155
- That would be foolish.
- I doubt I'll get 'em running.

266
00:20:11,189 --> 00:20:13,123
Keith, that would be foolish.

267
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:15,873
Well, you know me on being foolish.

268
00:20:16,805 --> 00:20:18,032
It wouldn't be the first time.

269
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:37,901
- Have you let them out yet?
- No, I haven't.

270
00:20:38,197 --> 00:20:41,111
- Are you being a good guest?
- I'm trying to be.

271
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:49,267
It's kind of further out
from the city than I thought.

272
00:20:49,954 --> 00:20:54,018
Yeah...well. Perhaps with the ....
you would have found that out first.

273
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:55,160
Yeah.

274
00:20:56,277 --> 00:20:57,735
Maybe...

275
00:20:58,734 --> 00:21:02,592
- You still want to be there, don't you?
- I don't know.

276
00:21:02,649 --> 00:21:04,336
<i>It's so nice.</i>

277
00:21:06,537 --> 00:21:09,483
<i>We've been round them,
well, there's so many times.</i>

278
00:21:10,084 --> 00:21:13,227
<i>You know what your uncle
will say, if he's still here.</i>

279
00:21:13,228 --> 00:21:16,135
<i>He'll say feel it, not the
thinking about it so much.</i>

280
00:21:16,736 --> 00:21:20,060
<i>Although I sometimes want to come
and just kidnap you and take you home</i>

281
00:21:20,061 --> 00:21:22,575
<i>because it's pretty bloody
quiet over here without you.</i>

282
00:21:23,176 --> 00:21:25,549
<i>Now, you are practising aren't you?</i>

283
00:21:25,593 --> 00:21:26,048
No...

284
00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:29,510
<i>Oh, Sophie.
Why not?</i>

285
00:21:29,811 --> 00:21:32,796
<i>Let me know how much,
I would have sent you.</i>

286
00:21:32,831 --> 00:21:35,138
Just don't know how I'm paying for.

287
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:40,547
Anybody else? I know it's
a long way. Thanks for coming.

288
00:21:40,991 --> 00:21:41,984
Sophie.

289
00:21:42,945 --> 00:21:46,498
Everybody, this is Sophie Williams.
Make her welcome.

290
00:21:46,709 --> 00:21:47,664
and ...

291
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,928
thanks for joining us.

292
00:21:52,139 --> 00:21:54,093
In fact, Sophie, why don't
you play something for us?

293
00:21:54,094 --> 00:21:56,940
as a way to introduce
yourself to the class.

294
00:22:04,661 --> 00:22:08,974
Just a way of ... saying hi.

295
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,435
I just haven't
really prepared anything.

296
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,460
It doesn't matter,
anything you like.

297
00:25:57,705 --> 00:26:00,781
- What is your name? Wendy.
- Yes

298
00:26:04,169 --> 00:26:05,997
Why are we going
down there again?

299
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:07,581
To have a good time!

300
00:26:07,582 --> 00:26:10,017
They love you.
We're gonna have a good time.

301
00:26:12,156 --> 00:26:14,034
Hi!

302
00:26:14,069 --> 00:26:17,430
We just had it freshly
painted, so it smells a little.

303
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:22,402
And we just had this. This was
a kind of an emerald green...

304
00:26:23,697 --> 00:26:29,520
- It's gorgeous.
- It does. We want to bring the ocean in.

305
00:26:34,651 --> 00:26:36,676
How long have you lived in your house?

306
00:26:37,615 --> 00:26:40,668
It's a ... sixteen years.

307
00:26:41,654 --> 00:26:44,085
- How long have you been married?
- Seventeen years.

308
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,775
- Got a house, got married.
- Became a teacher.

309
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:52,989
The house we could have passed out.

310
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:55,782
I got that in foreclosure.
It was such a bargain.

311
00:26:55,848 --> 00:27:00,063
We would have stayed in the city,
but the house was so beautiful.

312
00:27:00,098 --> 00:27:02,622
Good for you, I mean everybody
we know is getting divorce.

313
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,658
We have been to six divorce
parties in the past few months.

314
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:09,429
It's a very nice
way of saying goodbye.

315
00:27:09,435 --> 00:27:14,254
And sometimes, the best man and the
maid honor come and they separate them,

316
00:27:14,292 --> 00:27:16,293
and you know she sounds beautiful.

317
00:27:16,294 --> 00:27:17,538
You're a good cook.

318
00:27:19,016 --> 00:27:21,422
I'm not, I was ...

319
00:27:21,551 --> 00:27:23,440
Well, I have a girl come
to the house once a week.

320
00:27:23,445 --> 00:27:25,496
She makes everything, we freeze it.

321
00:27:26,405 --> 00:27:30,164
- It's so simple...
- I have all these frozen squab.

322
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:42,127
I heard you got a very attractive
young lady over there staying with you.

323
00:27:45,621 --> 00:27:46,844
How 's that going?

324
00:27:48,013 --> 00:27:49,434
She's cute.

325
00:27:50,187 --> 00:27:52,723
- Yeah, it's good.
- Ever make you think twice?

326
00:27:55,635 --> 00:27:57,955
Not that I'm looking, or ...

327
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:01,716
It would be nice to be young again.

328
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:04,765
- Honey are you ready?
- I'm starving !

329
00:28:04,548 --> 00:28:06,286
I know...  we're almost there.

330
00:28:06,992 --> 00:28:08,715
Eats like a horse!

331
00:28:10,883 --> 00:28:13,398
- Are you going to be alright?
- Yeah, I'm good.

332
00:28:13,433 --> 00:28:15,180
Hi Mark, I'm going to
take a look around.

333
00:28:15,181 --> 00:28:17,376
Yeah, walk around.
Make yourself at home.

334
00:28:37,996 --> 00:28:40,497
- Hey...
- Hey.

335
00:28:42,841 --> 00:28:44,634
He had to get away for a bit.

336
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,579
Yeah...

337
00:28:48,888 --> 00:28:50,458
These are my favorite people.

338
00:28:59,117 --> 00:29:02,711
- Are you?
- Yeah. I'm just going to take my stuff.

339
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:07,263
- I could have changed...
- No, it's okay.

340
00:29:08,259 --> 00:29:11,938
- Are we leaving soon?
- I think so.

341
00:29:46,588 --> 00:29:48,702
Why don't you go for a swim?
Go for a night swim.

342
00:29:50,572 --> 00:29:53,601
- Keep your clothes on !
- Oh, come on.

343
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:01,831
- Should we take our clothes off?
- Yeah, why not, yeah!

344
00:30:03,866 --> 00:30:05,365
One more beer for that.

345
00:30:05,647 --> 00:30:07,003
Here we come.

346
00:30:32,258 --> 00:30:34,040
Oh! that's so pretty.

347
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:38,882
Oh, that's really ...
I like clothes loose too.

348
00:30:41,748 --> 00:30:43,640
Oh cool!

349
00:30:45,892 --> 00:30:50,285
- That's great !
- It's a little toxic smelling.

350
00:30:51,857 --> 00:30:54,106
- I can smell something funny, though.
- It smells like rubber.

351
00:30:54,107 --> 00:30:56,212
- No it's a kind of ....
- It's something different.

352
00:30:56,213 --> 00:30:57,890
... like a new car smell.

353
00:30:59,514 --> 00:31:00,893
Is that what it is?

354
00:31:00,894 --> 00:31:02,953
Car ....

355
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,787
Oh my God!
I can't catch him.

356
00:31:06,188 --> 00:31:08,505
Oh my God!

357
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,048
Oh my God, it's a TV favourite !

358
00:31:14,714 --> 00:31:18,124
- What do you think?
- It's great. Yeah.

359
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:19,996
Put the key.
Here. Put the key.

360
00:31:23,017 --> 00:31:25,011
Thank you Momma !

361
00:31:26,686 --> 00:31:28,505
- Sophie, you want to go?
- Yeah!

362
00:31:28,506 --> 00:31:29,813
- Ok, let's go.
- Ok.

363
00:31:29,814 --> 00:31:30,603
Where are you going to go?

364
00:31:30,672 --> 00:31:32,315
We gonna go meet my friends.

365
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,634
- Goodbye !
- See you later.

366
00:31:58,698 --> 00:32:00,875
Lauren text it,
breath the rest of the way.

367
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:03,340
- Where?
- By the school.

368
00:32:03,604 --> 00:32:06,948
- Oh... If.
- Oh no memory lane.

369
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,913
It's too loud!
Turn it down.

370
00:32:09,914 --> 00:32:11,289
Too loud?
It's great!

371
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:14,421
- Doesn't it sound great?
- No, you guys are so cute.

372
00:32:14,422 --> 00:32:15,296
We could still be cute.

373
00:32:15,297 --> 00:32:17,471
You gotta transfer these,
they gonna get ruined.

374
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,670
- They all stretched out.
- Look at this. It's fine.

375
00:32:22,064 --> 00:32:25,601
- Exciting, wasn't it?
- What? Life with no money?

376
00:32:25,666 --> 00:32:27,557
Strangers working off our couch?

377
00:32:27,722 --> 00:32:29,157
- Yeah...
- No hot water?

378
00:32:29,722 --> 00:32:31,552
- Being creative.
- Cockroaches.

379
00:32:31,787 --> 00:32:33,142
- Being spontaneous.
- Noise.

380
00:32:33,177 --> 00:32:34,943
- Being inspired.
- Pre-science.

381
00:32:35,041 --> 00:32:36,046
Don't you think?

382
00:32:36,433 --> 00:32:39,338
Oh, honey every eight
months is the same old ...

383
00:32:39,339 --> 00:32:40,639
If I get the chair...

384
00:32:41,023 --> 00:32:44,616
I think we should think
about the city again.

385
00:32:47,714 --> 00:32:51,574
- I think it would be... inspirational.
- Even if that happens, we making more

386
00:32:51,575 --> 00:32:55,341
money, we still won't have
enough money to sell this house.

387
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:58,121
I don't think you understand that stuff.

388
00:32:59,156 --> 00:33:01,923
Do you know how much
apartments go for right now?

389
00:33:01,967 --> 00:33:04,922
They are well over a million dollars.
A million dollars!

390
00:33:04,939 --> 00:33:09,041
We have to invest, I just think we need to
be able to have a conversation about it.

391
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:12,709
I just think that we had
a life that was cut short.

392
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:15,791
- Cause we had a baby, you call that cut short?
- Yeah, we had a baby.

393
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,397
I thought we would be
expanding our lives.

394
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:18,991
Sure, but she's not a baby anymore.

395
00:33:19,026 --> 00:33:21,144
She's gonna move out of home soon.

396
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:25,709
We talked about the fact that when she was
old enough we could reconsider the city.

397
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:27,532
Yeah, if we could afford it, we can't..

398
00:33:27,541 --> 00:33:29,841
This feel like we're
not even discussing it.

399
00:33:32,242 --> 00:33:35,933
Shouldn't you be practicing
for your audition tomorrow?

400
00:33:36,069 --> 00:33:37,383
Yeah..

401
00:33:38,942 --> 00:33:40,242
You should.

402
00:33:46,378 --> 00:33:50,221
Oh we're doing it for the birthday girl.
So wish her Happy Birthday.

403
00:33:50,411 --> 00:33:52,641
- Happy eighteen !
- Yeah..!

404
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:57,842
Hey.

405
00:34:00,124 --> 00:34:01,677
- How 's it going?
- Okay.

406
00:34:02,308 --> 00:34:05,013
Could I pinch a cigarrette
from you, please?

407
00:34:05,248 --> 00:34:06,293
Of course.

408
00:34:06,801 --> 00:34:08,117
Thank you.

409
00:34:15,737 --> 00:34:18,293
- How's Lauren been?
- Great, yeah.

410
00:34:18,294 --> 00:34:19,031
Yeah, she's great.

411
00:34:19,032 --> 00:34:22,055
It's very nice of her to
give up half her bedroom.

412
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,875
It's not like she's
giving up that much.

413
00:34:29,615 --> 00:34:31,688
You like living here?

414
00:34:31,849 --> 00:34:35,000
Yeah, I love being so close to the interstate.

415
00:34:35,235 --> 00:34:36,902
I go in all the time, so...

416
00:34:37,643 --> 00:34:41,487
I'd just like to go into Manhattan
at some point, I think.

417
00:34:45,642 --> 00:34:48,900
And you just met these
dudes the night before?

418
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,108
Are you telling the story about how you
lost your maidenhead riding horseback?

419
00:34:55,143 --> 00:34:55,917
No!

420
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,553
You're so gross!

421
00:34:58,641 --> 00:35:00,091
Okay.

422
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:06,871
Do you think.. are you
going to be sick again?

423
00:35:06,872 --> 00:35:09,277
Do you think ...
what you wanna do?

424
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:18,163
Are you feeling a bit better?

425
00:35:19,318 --> 00:35:21,090
Yeah, I just feel tired.

426
00:35:23,361 --> 00:35:25,092
Did you talk to Aaron tonight?

427
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:27,479
I did, a little bit.

428
00:35:28,743 --> 00:35:30,708
Did you know that I had sex with him?

429
00:35:33,077 --> 00:35:35,781
- Did you lose your ...
- Yes.

430
00:35:37,446 --> 00:35:39,919
You should make sure
that he is nice to you.

431
00:35:40,517 --> 00:35:44,457
He told everybody that we had sex,
and he told me he wasn't going to.

432
00:35:44,492 --> 00:35:47,556
And now everybody thinks
I am a slut and I'm not.

433
00:35:47,644 --> 00:35:51,268
And I have like, not
even hook up with any guys.

434
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,750
Are you a virgin?

435
00:35:59,944 --> 00:36:01,277
Nope.

436
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,429
- Hey.
- Hi.

437
00:36:18,078 --> 00:36:19,655
How are you doing?

438
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:22,304
Good.

439
00:36:25,345 --> 00:36:26,544
Nervous.

440
00:36:40,045 --> 00:36:41,445
Sit down.

441
00:36:45,408 --> 00:36:46,661
Why?

442
00:36:47,185 --> 00:36:49,044
Just sit down.

443
00:36:57,536 --> 00:36:58,943
Close your eyes.

444
00:37:03,482 --> 00:37:05,790
You have to take off your glasses.

445
00:37:14,743 --> 00:37:16,292
Sit up straight.

446
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,076
And relax your shoulders...

447
00:37:20,741 --> 00:37:22,475
and relax your neck.

448
00:37:24,633 --> 00:37:27,007
And breathe in through your nose...

449
00:37:28,833 --> 00:37:30,458
and out through your mouth.

450
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:34,964
Breathe in ...

451
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:39,414
and out ...

452
00:37:42,645 --> 00:37:48,401
and ...
and out.

453
00:38:07,476 --> 00:38:09,286
How does it feel?

454
00:38:11,398 --> 00:38:12,610
Better ...

455
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:28,743
My uncle used to say...

456
00:38:29,308 --> 00:38:31,706
don't let fear become your profession.

457
00:38:34,542 --> 00:38:37,429
- It's good advice.
- Keith !

458
00:38:38,507 --> 00:38:40,134
Bonjour...

459
00:38:41,497 --> 00:38:42,831
Good luck.

460
00:38:42,979 --> 00:38:44,574
Thank you.

461
00:40:29,713 --> 00:40:31,413
Thank you very much.

462
00:40:45,575 --> 00:40:47,388
- It was okay.
- Mm hm.

463
00:40:47,982 --> 00:40:50,476
When are you next
playing with the orchestra?

464
00:40:51,057 --> 00:40:52,522
Friday.

465
00:40:52,562 --> 00:40:55,724
- And maybe Saturday, huh?
- On Saturday too?

466
00:40:55,725 --> 00:40:58,186
Can you let me know
if you want a ride down.

467
00:40:58,221 --> 00:40:59,932
We could come and watch you play.

468
00:40:59,988 --> 00:41:01,418
Yeah, well that'll be good.

469
00:41:01,419 --> 00:41:04,200
It would be nice to see
him with everyone else.

470
00:41:04,757 --> 00:41:08,379
It's incredible, I mean
that ... it really is.

471
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,204
Yeah, I guess, yeah.

472
00:41:10,432 --> 00:41:13,674
- What are you playing?
- Which pieces?

473
00:41:13,774 --> 00:41:16,715
We have a number,
Schumann, Bet, Mozart...

474
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,944
Brahms, sounds incredible.

475
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,391
Yeah, I bet.

476
00:41:23,262 --> 00:41:24,499
Great Friday.

477
00:41:29,577 --> 00:41:31,156
How I wish we had a piano.

478
00:41:37,138 --> 00:41:39,471
Are you sure you have?

479
00:43:34,423 --> 00:43:35,264
Hey!

480
00:43:37,399 --> 00:43:40,037
Oh my God !
Wow.

481
00:43:40,408 --> 00:43:43,307
Hi Sheldon, nice to see you.

482
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:46,046
- I'm glad you came.
- Of course, we wouldn't miss it.

483
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,491
I think we'd genuinely enjoy it tonight.

484
00:43:47,492 --> 00:43:49,067
Yeah, what's going on?

485
00:43:49,098 --> 00:43:52,315
- Thank you.
- Oh yeah... I'm sorry about this.

486
00:43:52,316 --> 00:43:54,091
Oh yes...
I've corrupted him.

487
00:43:54,092 --> 00:43:55,192
Again?

488
00:43:55,496 --> 00:43:57,388
- Wow...
- Hey so Sheldon, this is Sophie.

489
00:43:57,389 --> 00:43:59,363
She's a ... she's one of my student

490
00:43:59,398 --> 00:44:00,225
Nice to meet you.

491
00:44:00,227 --> 00:44:03,843
Exchange student from the UK
and an amazing piano player.

492
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,329
She knocks this
Chopin piece out of a part.

493
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:07,434
What was it?
It was the ...

494
00:44:07,435 --> 00:44:09,376
It's actually one
of his warm up pieces

495
00:44:09,451 --> 00:44:13,245
but it is so extraordinary that
you can play as a concert piece.

496
00:44:13,377 --> 00:44:16,228
Chopin...
Have you studied a long time?

497
00:44:17,745 --> 00:44:18,889
Many years.

498
00:44:18,953 --> 00:44:20,721
I would think, Chopin, well.

499
00:44:21,994 --> 00:44:23,900
- That's great!  Congratulations.
- Thank you !

500
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:25,933
You'll have to play for us some night.

501
00:44:25,934 --> 00:44:27,427
- Yeah, I'd love too.
- The front row.

502
00:44:27,462 --> 00:44:28,374
- Yeah, that would be great!

503
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:30,967
Lauren, you also play too?
Don't you like to ...?

504
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:32,437
- No...
- I'm sorry.

505
00:44:32,472 --> 00:44:34,528
- Lauren is champion swimmer.
She's incredible.

506
00:44:34,529 --> 00:44:36,341
Swimming, that's right.

507
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:39,416
- He brags about you all the time.
- Yeah.

508
00:44:48,584 --> 00:44:50,490
Are you sure you don't want to come?

509
00:44:51,193 --> 00:44:54,060
You don't have to be concerned,
I don't feel like going.

510
00:44:54,189 --> 00:44:57,893
- I don't feel left out or whatever.
- I know... I hope, I'm not.

511
00:44:57,894 --> 00:44:59,102
I don't wanna ...

512
00:45:00,589 --> 00:45:04,431
I think it's gonna be
really strange, me and Aaron.

513
00:45:04,491 --> 00:45:06,969
He said that he was going
to be a group of us.

514
00:45:07,179 --> 00:45:11,722
I don't want to be offending
you by going with your person ...

515
00:45:11,723 --> 00:45:15,661
Sophie ! Sophie !
Ok... I really don't care.

516
00:45:15,662 --> 00:45:18,122
I don't know how many
ways to tell you that, you know.

517
00:45:18,157 --> 00:45:20,744
Well... I'm not going to force
you if you don't want to come.

518
00:45:21,014 --> 00:45:23,183
Thank you.

519
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:14,955
On to your wrist.

520
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:19,037
- What do you want?
- Let me get a vodka soda, please.

521
00:46:19,106 --> 00:46:21,892
These are from my cousin,
he runs the place.

522
00:46:22,091 --> 00:46:25,511
- That's very kind of you.
- No, it's going to make it a lot of fun.

523
00:46:25,546 --> 00:46:27,882
What time is everyone else staying?

524
00:46:29,075 --> 00:46:31,872
- What?
- What time is everyone else staying here?

525
00:46:32,919 --> 00:46:33,932
Just us.

526
00:46:35,412 --> 00:46:36,327
Just us tonight.

527
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:38,086
- How much is that?
- Twenty-three.

528
00:46:40,012 --> 00:46:41,226
Thank you.

529
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:30,213
Thank you... see you on Monday.

530
00:47:31,799 --> 00:47:33,181
Ok...

531
00:47:34,465 --> 00:47:37,737
You looked great all night.
I mean you're so sexy at that club.

532
00:47:41,505 --> 00:47:46,522
- This isn't like a "thing."
- Aren't expecting to be a thing. It's ok.

533
00:47:47,857 --> 00:47:49,743
Ok, I have to focus.

534
00:47:54,969 --> 00:47:58,354
Aaron ! Aaron !
Aaron ! Aaron !

535
00:48:01,012 --> 00:48:02,977
Aaron, Aaron it's okay.

536
00:48:12,249 --> 00:48:13,369
Don't pull my hair.

537
00:48:14,292 --> 00:48:15,434
Close the door, will ya?

538
00:48:16,335 --> 00:48:18,236
Pleae stop it man.

539
00:48:19,003 --> 00:48:20,393
Oh, fuck !

540
00:48:20,762 --> 00:48:21,773
Close the door.

541
00:48:22,962 --> 00:48:25,388
Aaron, fuck off man!

542
00:50:36,626 --> 00:50:38,515
Come on Laurie go, go !

543
00:50:50,251 --> 00:50:51,813
- What happened?
- I don't know...

544
00:50:51,814 --> 00:50:53,697
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

545
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,925
What?

546
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:58,910
Aaron slept with Sophie.

547
00:51:00,549 --> 00:51:02,525
- When?
- Friday.

548
00:51:04,106 --> 00:51:05,650
What?

549
00:51:05,492 --> 00:51:07,469
- Everyone get to see?
- Yeah.

550
00:51:07,796 --> 00:51:09,380
Aaron slept with Sophie.

551
00:51:17,817 --> 00:51:20,878
Oh no.
Come on, come on.

552
00:51:47,092 --> 00:51:48,770
Sophie, I'll give you a ride!

553
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:15,229
Oh, my God !
That's insane!

554
00:52:15,989 --> 00:52:17,796
I am trying to change !

555
00:52:17,807 --> 00:52:20,107
- Oh shit! Power's out.
-What?

556
00:52:25,132 --> 00:52:27,299
Don't slip, don't trip.

557
00:53:03,236 --> 00:53:06,146
- Do you want tea?
- I'm gonna have a beer.

558
00:53:06,511 --> 00:53:07,575
Beer?

559
00:53:11,477 --> 00:53:13,257
Can I have a beer?

560
00:53:47,271 --> 00:53:49,065
Do you know what time they'll be back?

561
00:53:52,178 --> 00:53:56,188
It depends... how many girls...

562
00:53:56,523 --> 00:53:59,090
they ask to ferry home, I guess.

563
00:54:07,493 --> 00:54:10,177
Why don't you want to play?
That's what I want to know.

564
00:54:10,178 --> 00:54:12,971
That's the big question, isn't it?

565
00:54:14,429 --> 00:54:17,728
- Why do I want to play?
- Why don't you want to play !

566
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:25,426
I don't know... I want to choose to play,
I don't wanna do it because I can.

567
00:54:26,535 --> 00:54:29,367
I mean, you're incredible.
How long have you played?

568
00:54:29,535 --> 00:54:33,620
I started training when I was five,
So pretty long time.

569
00:54:34,284 --> 00:54:37,867
John, my uncle got me into the piano,

570
00:54:38,035 --> 00:54:42,268
while he was a teacher
and a pianist and I started.

571
00:54:42,425 --> 00:54:45,545
He would play in the house and
I just kept running up to him.

572
00:54:45,987 --> 00:54:48,954
- Something like, let me play.
- Really?

573
00:54:48,989 --> 00:54:54,207
- Yeah when I was ... that's all.
- Was your dad and your mom musical?

574
00:54:55,004 --> 00:55:00,453
My dad, he used to play guitar and
my mom died when I was really little.

575
00:55:00,933 --> 00:55:03,922
And it was hard for him
to have me on his own, so...

576
00:55:05,095 --> 00:55:07,339
So that's why my aunt
and uncle brought me up.

577
00:55:11,479 --> 00:55:14,557
I was very close to my uncle.

578
00:55:14,564 --> 00:55:17,701
But he passed away recently.
He was very ill.

579
00:55:18,321 --> 00:55:19,830
Sorry.

580
00:55:20,521 --> 00:55:24,500
Yeah, and then I started doing it
professionally when I was nine.

581
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:29,762
- In bars, weddings?
- Just, you know... karaoke.

582
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:34,195
I think you should
have been a comedian.

583
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,477
You're definitely
in the wrong job.

584
00:55:38,419 --> 00:55:40,419
Oh, I know that...

585
00:55:40,194 --> 00:55:43,692
I never wanted to teach,
I'm not a teacher.

586
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,642
I have something to tell you.

587
00:55:47,275 --> 00:55:48,261
You're a teacher.

588
00:55:49,366 --> 00:55:54,634
- You are a teacher.
- It says that I am a text form teacher.

589
00:55:55,917 --> 00:55:57,599
So why do you do it, then?

590
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:00,816
It was a job, you see what I mean.

591
00:56:00,891 --> 00:56:01,890
Secure and...

592
00:56:02,864 --> 00:56:06,608
You know, at least I 'm
teaching the subjects I know

593
00:56:06,643 --> 00:56:09,497
and I'm not teaching
math, or something.

594
00:56:10,735 --> 00:56:12,765
Well, you just have to make
sure that you're choosing.

595
00:56:16,647 --> 00:56:20,395
I just don't want to
be living a life where...

596
00:56:21,179 --> 00:56:23,577
I'm not choosing stuff.

597
00:56:25,031 --> 00:56:27,903
My dad never really got to
do what he wanted to do.

598
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:30,900
Well he started doing it and
then he kind of fucked himself up.

599
00:56:30,913 --> 00:56:32,660
A lot of people fucked themselves up.

600
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:37,613
Have you fucked yourself up?

601
00:56:42,912 --> 00:56:45,805
You don't seem as
young as you actually are.

602
00:56:47,706 --> 00:56:49,498
One day you'll be free.

603
00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:01,433
I'd like to play something for you.

604
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:00,546
Keith !

605
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:04,611
Lauren is with you?  Wipers
didn't work. The car is a hazard.

606
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:09,879
- Yeah.. I'm here.
- You took the Jeep.

607
01:00:09,914 --> 01:00:10,789
i'm sorry.

608
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:12,938
- Why did you take the Jeep?
- I was trying to get your attention !

609
01:00:12,939 --> 01:00:14,803
- get my attention?
- I don't have the keys.

610
01:00:14,804 --> 01:00:17,005
I was just trying to
get the swim team home.

611
01:00:17,181 --> 01:00:18,120
What happened?

612
01:00:18,122 --> 01:00:19,565
- This just broke.
- How did this break?

613
01:00:20,596 --> 01:00:21,940
Why are the lights out?

614
01:00:23,488 --> 01:00:25,951
Sorry, I couldn't see.
I knocked it off. I'm sorry.

615
01:00:25,952 --> 01:00:27,786
How could you knock this off?
This is the safest place.

616
01:00:27,787 --> 01:00:28,938
The lights are out.
I couldn't see.

617
01:00:28,939 --> 01:00:31,451
- Is Sophie home?
- Yes, I drove her home.

618
01:00:35,939 --> 01:00:37,103
You're having a beer?

619
01:00:50,410 --> 01:00:54,057
It is a weight on my shoulders trying to
get you show some interest and passion

620
01:00:54,058 --> 01:00:56,172
and for 17 years I have tried to ...

621
01:00:56,173 --> 01:00:58,417
I did what I was doing 17 years ago

622
01:00:58,418 --> 01:01:01,993
I love teaching kids... in a
school ....

623
01:01:05,658 --> 01:01:07,128
You said you enjoyed teaching

624
01:01:08,777 --> 01:01:10,575
Well, you said you enjoyed driving.

625
01:01:12,757 --> 01:01:15,100
You 're an jerk.

626
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:41,368
- Slut.
- I know.

627
01:02:28,553 --> 01:02:32,090
That's way too fast, I wouldn't
even attempt something like that.

628
01:02:32,481 --> 01:02:33,672
That's you crazy?

629
01:02:33,681 --> 01:02:35,233
I'm trying to know you all are.

630
01:02:48,082 --> 01:02:51,027
Chloe, will you hand these out.
I'll be back.

631
01:02:51,162 --> 01:02:52,101
I'll be back.

632
01:02:57,835 --> 01:02:58,722
Hey...

633
01:03:02,496 --> 01:03:05,533
- Can you talk?
- Of course, what's wrong?

634
01:03:13,088 --> 01:03:16,187
I just feel like I 'm causing
so many problems here.

635
01:03:17,487 --> 01:03:19,034
No, you're not.

636
01:03:20,248 --> 01:03:22,317
- I just needed...
- You're not.

637
01:03:53,759 --> 01:03:54,843
Look...

638
01:03:55,396 --> 01:03:59,308
I have period after lunch, and
I can get someone to substitute.

639
01:03:59,344 --> 01:04:02,724
Just wanna go somewhere?

640
01:04:05,082 --> 01:04:07,016
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

641
01:04:09,781 --> 01:04:11,004
Ok.

642
01:04:16,171 --> 01:04:18,694
I'll come find you.

643
01:04:18,944 --> 01:04:20,824
Thank you.

644
01:05:09,131 --> 01:05:12,100
It's funny that it took you to bring
me here. I've lived here for 20 years.

645
01:05:12,901 --> 01:05:14,877
You have nver been here.

646
01:05:15,278 --> 01:05:17,864
I didn't pass it, but I've
never actually come down here.

647
01:05:18,465 --> 01:05:19,365
Why?

648
01:05:20,766 --> 01:05:23,334
Cause I have never a reason to.

649
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:30,602
It would be nice not to
go back at all, wouldn't it?

650
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:37,586
It's so hard to actually
do what you want to do.

651
01:05:38,953 --> 01:05:45,034
What's this gonna say, it's funny that
we you feel so contrained by what

652
01:05:45,303 --> 01:05:49,246
you think our options are.
But what about my options?

653
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:53,698
I think that's hard to know.

654
01:05:54,103 --> 01:05:56,931
How to be... like truly free.

655
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:03,588
And whether that's
even a good thing.

656
01:06:08,422 --> 01:06:11,742
Maybe boundaries are there for a good reason.

657
01:06:11,991 --> 01:06:15,356
- Structure.
- Something I could teach.

658
01:06:37,921 --> 01:06:40,156
What makes you happy?

659
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:47,255
At the moment there is only really
one thing that makes me happy.

660
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:48,612
Really?

661
01:06:50,037 --> 01:06:51,926
It's true.

662
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:13,476
What do you thinki?

663
01:07:18,193 --> 01:07:20,375
I'll miss you if you ran away.

664
01:07:21,841 --> 01:07:23,626
I am not running away.

665
01:07:30,309 --> 01:07:32,828
My ... a lot of thing.

666
01:07:36,098 --> 01:07:39,380
I want you to steal me away,
that's what I want you to do.

667
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:42,040
In your life.

668
01:07:47,739 --> 01:07:52,727
Get in the car...
and start driving.

669
01:08:17,685 --> 01:08:19,608
Do not ....

670
01:08:57,730 --> 01:09:00,669
- So how was Sophie?
- Well, pretty good.

671
01:09:05,289 --> 01:09:07,562
Wait... what... !

672
01:09:09,831 --> 01:09:10,988
You serious, Lauren?

673
01:09:11,089 --> 01:09:14,335
- Just get into the car.
- Oh, my God.

674
01:11:07,816 --> 01:11:11,120
- Where is Lauren?
- She's at Angela's.

675
01:11:12,088 --> 01:11:13,615
Excuse me.

676
01:11:32,446 --> 01:11:35,053
Great, bye.

677
01:11:40,212 --> 01:11:44,138
- She spending the night?
- That was Bruce.

678
01:11:45,954 --> 01:11:47,663
I got the chair.

679
01:12:00,111 --> 01:12:04,658
Guess I'm, not a teacher any more.

680
01:12:05,809 --> 01:12:07,516
We have to celebrate.

681
01:12:08,410 --> 01:12:11,131
- I'm getting ice cream.
- Well, I haven't finished.

682
01:12:11,343 --> 01:12:13,682
Well, Sophie and I will have
some joint chocolate, strawberry?

683
01:12:13,709 --> 01:12:15,209
Alright I 'm okay, thanks.

684
01:12:15,249 --> 01:12:17,720
Alright, well then,
I'm going to celebrate.

685
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:06,649
Are you okay?

686
01:13:07,013 --> 01:13:08,888
Lauren...you so fucking small.

687
01:13:10,501 --> 01:13:11,730
Stop it.

688
01:13:14,112 --> 01:13:15,607
- What's wrong with you?
- Stop it.

689
01:13:16,002 --> 01:13:19,299
Lauren, I didn't sleep with Aaron.

690
01:13:22,834 --> 01:13:23,640
Sit up.

691
01:13:28,824 --> 01:13:30,017
This is my house.

692
01:13:33,249 --> 01:13:34,379
I'm sorry.

693
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:40,775
I saw you at the reservoir today.

694
01:13:42,622 --> 01:13:44,363
Stop breathing like that.

695
01:13:46,147 --> 01:13:47,294
You have to get out.

696
01:13:47,395 --> 01:13:51,046
I don't have to get out !
I don't need to get out of your bed.

697
01:13:51,415 --> 01:13:53,849
Lauren!
Lauren!

698
01:13:56,516 --> 01:13:57,411
Don't!

699
01:13:58,656 --> 01:14:00,048
Please.

700
01:14:03,257 --> 01:14:04,602
I'm sorry!

701
01:14:30,829 --> 01:14:31,890
What's wrong?

702
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:36,018
Are you okay?

703
01:14:41,688 --> 01:14:45,922
I... I can't stay here anymore.

704
01:14:49,792 --> 01:14:52,273
- I have to leave.
- I don't want you to leave.

705
01:14:52,274 --> 01:14:53,534
I know...

706
01:14:58,185 --> 01:14:59,310
What happened?

707
01:15:05,490 --> 01:15:07,751
- I have to go.
- I don't want you to go.

708
01:15:16,089 --> 01:15:20,701
Listen...
I'm playing tomorrow night.

709
01:15:23,028 --> 01:15:24,401
You meet me later.

710
01:15:26,113 --> 01:15:30,215
We just get in the
car and start driving.

711
01:15:38,305 --> 01:15:39,889
Ok.

712
01:16:08,487 --> 01:16:09,743
What are you doing?

713
01:16:14,516 --> 01:16:19,800
I 'm gonna to stay
with my friend, Jessica,

714
01:16:19,805 --> 01:16:21,174
for the evening.

715
01:16:22,099 --> 01:16:25,954
- Where?
- Her family has got a beach house.

716
01:16:25,973 --> 01:16:29,345
And she said we
could camp on the beach.

717
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:31,787
- Camping on the beach?
- Yeah.

718
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:38,017
Listen. That sounds really nice but
you have to ask my permission.

719
01:16:38,018 --> 01:16:40,900
I can't let you just take off like that.
You are my responsibility.

720
01:16:40,901 --> 01:16:42,321
Yeah, it's all being quite last minute,

721
01:16:42,322 --> 01:16:46,199
so I don't have a
chance to tell you last night.

722
01:16:49,588 --> 01:16:51,667
But I can call you when I get there.

723
01:16:52,368 --> 01:16:56,210
Did you see Lauren this morning,
by any chance, before she left?

724
01:16:56,245 --> 01:16:58,700
No... I got up later than her.

725
01:17:00,078 --> 01:17:02,301
- Do you want a ride?
- I'll be fine.

726
01:17:02,302 --> 01:17:05,348
- Ok, please be careful on the road.
- Ok.

727
01:17:51,845 --> 01:17:53,447
Lauren 's not picking up her phone.

728
01:17:54,865 --> 01:17:58,035
Did she say anything to you this
morning where she was going so early?

729
01:17:58,579 --> 01:18:00,377
She said she's fine.

730
01:18:01,866 --> 01:18:04,202
Sophie told me she's camping.

731
01:18:09,778 --> 01:18:10,735
I don't know...

732
01:18:13,771 --> 01:18:17,430
Wish someone would keep me in
the loop about what 's going on here.

733
01:18:17,431 --> 01:18:18,546
You gotta talk to these girls.

734
01:18:18,885 --> 01:18:22,067
- I'm playing tonight.
- Well, I'll talk to you after.

735
01:18:22,148 --> 01:18:24,575
Yeah.. I'm gonna take the Jeep.

736
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:27,191
- No.. I'll drive you.
- It's okay.

737
01:18:27,767 --> 01:18:30,303
- Really, I ...
- I don't need to take me, that's ok.

738
01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:51,031
You had us worried.

739
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:56,226
Did you call your mom?

740
01:19:05,965 --> 01:19:07,927
Are you okay?

741
01:20:48,011 --> 01:20:50,808
Hello, is this Jessica's mom?

742
01:20:51,977 --> 01:20:55,468
Oh hi, it's Megan Reynolds...
I am Sophie Williams...

743
01:20:55,559 --> 01:20:57,660
The English girl staying with us.

744
01:20:58,758 --> 01:21:00,036
Hi, is she there?

745
01:21:04,769 --> 01:21:09,632
She said she was going to the
beach with Jessica and your family.

746
01:21:17,858 --> 01:21:21,222
You know what?
She just walked in.

747
01:21:23,074 --> 01:21:24,747
Yeah..

748
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:27,643
Well, I hope it wasn't any bother.

749
01:21:27,707 --> 01:21:29,313
Ok...

750
01:21:29,747 --> 01:21:31,298
Thank you.

751
01:22:01,962 --> 01:22:06,176
Hey, may I talk to
you for a second?

752
01:22:07,078 --> 01:22:10,742
Um, I'm in the
middle of a conversation.

753
01:22:10,885 --> 01:22:12,892
- I know, but they don't just feel like.
- No.

754
01:22:13,953 --> 01:22:15,304
Not right now.

755
01:22:16,384 --> 01:22:18,417
So you see.

756
01:22:21,482 --> 01:22:23,401
I'll be right back, alright.

757
01:22:30,935 --> 01:22:33,099
Let me make you redeem for your car.

758
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:34,963
Stop it. Stop it.

759
01:22:37,464 --> 01:22:39,079
Enough.

760
01:22:39,647 --> 01:22:41,039
I'm sorry.

761
01:22:41,212 --> 01:22:43,758
I don't care.

762
01:22:44,757 --> 01:22:47,483
Stop it! Stop it!
Come on.

763
01:22:52,379 --> 01:22:54,043
You are pathetic.

764
01:26:02,535 --> 01:26:05,119
I don't think I made a mistake.

765
01:27:36,208 --> 01:27:37,117
What are they saying?

766
01:27:40,054 --> 01:27:41,713
They haven't said anything yet.

767
01:28:26,693 --> 01:28:29,753
Hi. You can come with me.

768
01:31:08,448 --> 01:31:11,082
You have any ideas ....?

769
01:31:14,501 --> 01:31:18,217
- Smile.
- One more smile.

770
01:31:30,037 --> 01:31:33,493
One, two, three.
Look here, smile.
