1
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,748
What happens when the light first pierces...

2
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,849
the dark dampness
in which we have waited?

3
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:43,361
We are slapped and cut loose.

4
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:48,860
If we are lucky,
someone is there to catch us...

5
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,764
and persuade us that we are safe.

6
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,599
But are we safe?

7
00:02:56,876 --> 00:03:00,471
What happens if, too early,
we lose a parent?

8
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:05,308
That party on whom we rely
for only everything?

9
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,781
Why, we are cut loose again...

10
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:12,550
and we wonder, even dread...

11
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,992
whose hands will catch us now.

12
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,102
There once lived a man
named Nicholas Nickleby.

13
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,733
Unambitious in business...

14
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:29,832
he devoted himself
to the happiness of his family.

15
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:34,372
But he is not the Nicholas Nickleby
you have come to hear about.

16
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,742
That Nicholas Nickleby is here.

17
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,481
And here.

18
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:44,419
And here.

19
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,885
- Said your prayers?
- Yes.

20
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,394
I prayed that I should have this day...

21
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:52,625
the same day we had today,
all the rest of my life.

22
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:56,366
But someday you will find someone
who will have...

23
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,331
a greater hold on your affections than I do.

24
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,468
The most important journey of your life...

25
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,807
will be to find her.

26
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,837
Nicholas had a younger sister, Kate.

27
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,277
Here she is again.

28
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,347
And here.

29
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,683
Goodness, how it goes.

30
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:20,748
For their father,
these children were a divine burden.

31
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,285
Never had money meant less to him...

32
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:26,192
and never had he needed it more.

33
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,062
His wife said:

34
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:30,227
Speculate.

35
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:34,331
Since it was well known
that Mr. Nickleby's brother, Ralph...

36
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:35,999
many years his senior...

37
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:39,340
had made his fortune in London
by just this method...

38
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:44,477
so Nicholas Nickleby,
who had never speculated...

39
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,108
speculated.

40
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,385
It is a particular sort of triumph...

41
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,721
that bankers
have made the word "speculation"...

42
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,919
synonymous with "adventure"...

43
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:59,624
when, indeed, it means only
that one may gain a great deal...

44
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:02,025
or one may lose a great deal.

45
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,635
Alas, for Mr. Nickleby, it meant the latter.

46
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,998
Four stockbrokers
took villa residences in Italy...

47
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,875
and 400 nobodies were ruined.

48
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,613
Eliminating all he had saved...

49
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,346
as well as any wish to earn it again...

50
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,814
Mr. Nickleby took to his bed...

51
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:26,818
until he surrendered
to the one certainty of life...

52
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:30,860
which no amount of speculation
can prevent.

53
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,396
What shall we do?

54
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,002
Here is Nicholas Nickleby again.

55
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,983
19 years old...

56
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:58,419
and head of his family.

57
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:13,969
Come here.

58
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:22,178
Said he would join me at the tavern.

59
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,112
Turnips and carrots!

60
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:26,911
Mind your back, miss.

61
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:05,490
Please, Mr. Nickleby, do you wish my father
to go to debtor's prison?

62
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,857
Where your father sleeps, Miss Bray,
is of no concern to me.

63
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:12,429
Father tells me the interest
is what makes the debt so unmanageable.

64
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,363
- Could you not stop it?
- Tell him...

65
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:18,495
to repay the loan.
That will stop the interest right away.

66
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,287
You must bear up against sorrow, ma'am.

67
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,692
I always do.

68
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,729
Mine was no common loss.

69
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,594
It was no uncommon loss.

70
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,894
Husbands die every day.

71
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,398
And wives.

72
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,170
Brothers also.

73
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,439
Yes, and puppies, too.

74
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,703
Ma'am, you did not mention
what my brother's complaint was.

75
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:04,349
We feel he died of a broken heart.

76
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,478
Pooh, there's no such thing.

77
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,683
Indeed, if you have no heart to break.

78
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,854
In your letter, you said
the creditors had administered...

79
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:15,655
and nothing was left for you?

80
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:17,661
We tried to sell the house...

81
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:20,457
but no one seemed to want
a little home like ours.

82
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,900
So you spent what little remained
coming all the way to London...

83
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,268
to see what I could do for you?

84
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,530
It was your brother's dying wish...

85
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:32,108
that you might do something
for his children.

86
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,874
How is it, when a man dies
without property of his own...

87
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:37,245
he thinks he has the right
to dispose of others'?

88
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,841
What a feckless, inconsiderate man.

89
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,887
Our father, your brother, had a noble heart.

90
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,779
Which beats no more.

91
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:47,618
You, girl...

92
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,791
you haven't been brought up
too delicately...

93
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,593
to apprentice at some boarding school,
have you?

94
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,633
Uncle...

95
00:08:55,234 --> 00:08:58,670
I will try to do anything
to gain me a home and bread.

96
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:06,238
Now that I think of it, I know a dressmaker
who may have some work.

97
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,478
You, boy, have you ever done anything?

98
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:12,541
No.

99
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,343
Noggs, where's the morning paper
I left on my desk?

100
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,217
- On my desk.
- Bring it to me.

101
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:18,950
"Bring it to me."

102
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,386
Stop parroting me.

103
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:23,053
I wish I was a parrot. I'd fly away.

104
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:26,394
I wish you were a parrot, too.
I'd wring your neck.

105
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,628
- Read that.
- What is it, Nicholas?

106
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,596
An advertisement.

107
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:35,474
"Education at
Mr. Wackford Squeers' Academy."

108
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,772
Oh, no.

109
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:45,548
"Dotheboys Hall, at the delightful village
of Dotheboys, in Yorkshire.

110
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,045
"Youth are clothed, boarded and booked...

111
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,520
"instructed in all languages,
living and dead...

112
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,117
"mathematics, orthography,
the use of globes and single stick.

113
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,991
"Diet unparalleled.
An able assistant wanted.

114
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:00,388
"Annual salary £5.

115
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,696
"Master of Arts preferred."

116
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,564
I'm not a Master of Arts.

117
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:08,967
That can be got over, I believe.

118
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,009
But it is such a long way off.

119
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:15,411
If I am fortunate enough to be appointed,
what will become of those I leave behind?

120
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:18,881
It will be my immediate care
to place your mother and sister...

121
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:22,250
in some sphere of life
in which they may become independent.

122
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:26,423
I will not forget what you have done
for me this day, Uncle.

123
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,624
Nor shall I.

124
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,502
Any chimneys to sweep?

125
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,675
There he is. He's the man with one eye.

126
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:48,778
Though the popular prejudice
runs in favor of two.

127
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:52,674
- Is this one inch milk and the rest water?
- Aye, sir.

128
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,145
Here's richness.

129
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,757
When I say "one," you may take a drink.

130
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,588
When I say "number two,"
the boy next to you may take it...

131
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,994
and so on, till all five boys
have been nourished.

132
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:08,591
But work fast.
We leave when the coach horn blows.

133
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,032
Number one.

134
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,864
Number two.

135
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:14,266
Number three.

136
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,739
Number four.

137
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,475
Number five.

138
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,870
Out you go.

139
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:26,843
Subdue your appetites,
and you've conquered human nature.

140
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,149
Yorkshire coach leaves in five minutes!

141
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:32,516
Wait by the coach in a straight line.

142
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,920
Squeers, this is the boy I told you about.
My nephew.

143
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,191
I am most grateful for the opportunity
to serve, sir.

144
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:41,332
- Mr. Squeers.
- Mrs. Shaygar.

145
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,631
Could you give those to Henry?
Tuesday is his birthday.

146
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:48,299
Delighted, my dear.
The boy's happiness is our prime concern.

147
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,808
Three inside, two little ones up top.

148
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:56,475
Get up behind. If a boy drops off the back,
that's £20 a year lost.

149
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,615
If he is the schoolmaster,
what kind of school can it be?

150
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:04,988
I hardly know.

151
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,121
Bless you both.

152
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:12,991
Goodbye.

153
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:20,332
Someday, we will once again
share the protection of the same roof...

154
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:23,606
and revive the happiness denied to us now.

155
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:26,574
I promise.

156
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:33,174
Young man.

157
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,924
Forgive me. I know the world.

158
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,021
Your father didn't...

159
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:45,154
or he wouldn't have done me a kindness
without hope of a return.

160
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,825
You don't, or you wouldn't be bound
on such a journey.

161
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,870
If ever you should need help
or shelter in London...

162
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:56,074
Oh, dear. I once thought I never should.

163
00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:01,202
They know where I live,
at the Sign of the Crown in Golden Square.

164
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,106
You can come at night.

165
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:07,213
- Once, nobody was ashamed.
- Ashamed?

166
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:09,645
Where are you, Nickleby? Up.

167
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:13,850
If you should go near Barnard Castle,
there's good ale at the King's Head.

168
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,656
Say you know me,
and I'm sure they won't charge you for it.

169
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:18,957
And...

170
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,598
you may say "Mr. Noggs" there...

171
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,460
for I was a gentleman then.

172
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:26,794
I was.

173
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,074
- Walk on.
- Goodbye, Nicholas.

174
00:13:58,804 --> 00:13:59,793
Whoa!

175
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:13,444
Smike!

176
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,994
Is this Dotheboys Hall?

177
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,562
No need to call it a hall up here.

178
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,068
We call it that in London,
because it sounds better.

179
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,603
Hurry, lad!

180
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,620
Where the devil were you?

181
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,291
Please, sir...

182
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,194
I fell asleep over the fire.

183
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,765
Missus said I might go in there for a warm.

184
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:05,966
You'd have been a deuced deal
more wakeful out in the cold.

185
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,170
Is that my Squeery?

186
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:21,614
The crime of my dead eye, my love...

187
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:24,178
is that I can't see you twice.

188
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,920
- How's the pig?
- Just as you left her.

189
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,048
And the boys?

190
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,560
Young Braithwaite's had a fever.

191
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,757
Third time this year.

192
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:36,693
I say it's obstinacy,
and we beat it out of him.

193
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:40,729
No one can cure an illness
quicker than you, my love.

194
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,472
This is the new man, Mr. Nickleby.

195
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:49,912
- I hope you're not hungry.
- I am.

196
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,514
Of course you are.

197
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,552
I've got a nice hot stew
for you here, Squeery.

198
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,011
And there's bread on the table.

199
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:02,252
I brought the letters to the boys,
I'll read them in the morning.

200
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:05,195
- I'm doing the brimstone first.
- Of course you are.

201
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:09,968
Grand piece of meat in that, Squeery.
Put the heat back in you.

202
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,659
Aye, it will.

203
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,264
- How was your journey, my pet?
- Dreadful.

204
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,171
- Was it perishing?
- Torture.

205
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,439
What?

206
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:26,811
Have you...

207
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,978
Did anybody...

208
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,188
Has nothing been heard...

209
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:38,385
about me?

210
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:42,832
Not a word, and never will we.

211
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,902
But count your blessings.
You've been here all these years...

212
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:50,037
and not a penny paid after the first six.

213
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,640
No clue as to who you belong to,
and still I feed you.

214
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,510
That's cause for joy.

215
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,752
And here's more cause for joy.

216
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:03,987
Little Wackford.

217
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,153
Father!

218
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,331
Look what your pa brought you.

219
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,459
"Dear Kate...

220
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:58,833
"My first morning here began with the news
that the pump had frozen...

221
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,804
"but events soon distracted me. "

222
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,898
- Smike!
- Who are you after?

223
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:06,609
It's brimstone morning,
and I can't find the school spoon.

224
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:09,973
We purify the boys' blood
now and then, Nickleby.

225
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:12,608
Purify, fiddlesticks!

226
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:17,711
We give the boys brimstone and treacle,
Mr. Knuckleboy...

227
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,417
because if we didn't,
they'd always be ailing.

228
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:25,159
It spoils their appetites and comes cheaper
than breakfast and dinner.

229
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:29,023
You might say it does them good
and us good at the same time.

230
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,034
Smike!

231
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:36,874
- Where's the school spoon?
- Please, ma'am.

232
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,569
Please.

233
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:48,945
Don't contradict your mistress.

234
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:51,717
Take it.

235
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,790
Take it. Be thankful.

236
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:58,687
A most invaluable woman that.
I don't know her equal.

237
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,056
Nor I.

238
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:01,996
- No, please!
- Take it.

239
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:03,962
And thank me for it.

240
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,663
She does things for them boys...

241
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:09,468
that I don't believe half the mothers going
would do for their own sons.

242
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:12,575
- I should think they would not, sir.
- No.

243
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,113
"Mr. Squeers' return from London
is a great event...

244
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,476
"as he brings the boys news from home. "

245
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,142
Bolder, come here.

246
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,621
No letters.

247
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,059
But I saw your father in London.

248
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:31,925
He was £2.10 short in his payments.

249
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:33,521
One...

250
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,099
two, three...

251
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,835
- Four...
- Five, six.

252
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,264
But the good news is, we'll keep you on.
Smike, take him out.

253
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,735
Letter for Cobbey. Stand up.

254
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:50,042
Your grandmother's dead.

255
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:53,680
Your uncle's took to drink.

256
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:57,243
That's all the news your sister sends,
except for eight pence...

257
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,226
which will just cover the square of glass
you broke last week.

258
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:02,793
"After this, classes began. "

259
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:04,390
Where's Graymarsh?

260
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:06,964
Please, sir, he's cleaning
the back parlor window.

261
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:10,490
Perfect. C-L-E-A-N, "clean."

262
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,660
Verb, active, "to make bright."

263
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,362
"Winder," a casement.

264
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,670
"Win": W-l-N, "der": D-E-R.

265
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,439
When the boy knows this,
he goes and does it.

266
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,638
Where's Dorn?

267
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:24,682
- Please, sir, he's weeding the garden.
- To be sure.

268
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:29,511
"Bot": B-O-T, "tin": T-l-N, "ney": N-E-Y.

269
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,249
"Bottiney." Noun, substantive.

270
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:35,691
Knowledge of plants,
which he's applying right now.

271
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,355
That's our system, Nickleby.
What do you think of it?

272
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,430
It's useful.

273
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,794
"And so went the day.

274
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:46,533
"I very much hope I can be of service here. "

275
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:58,872
Are you cold?

276
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:01,783
You're shivering, poor fellow.

277
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:11,486
There.

278
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,194
Oh, dear, my heart.

279
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,603
I feel lost here, too.

280
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,301
But we must always hope.

281
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,406
Hope?

282
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:35,549
Do you remember the boy who died here?

283
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:37,619
I was not here.

284
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,421
What of him?

285
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:44,792
I was with him that night.

286
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:49,963
He began to see faces around his bed
that came from home.

287
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:57,301
He said they smiled and talked to him.

288
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:03,205
At last, he died...

289
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,751
lifting his head to kiss them.

290
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:14,382
Yes?

291
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,797
What faces will smile on me when I die?

292
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,630
Who will comfort me that long night?

293
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,871
They cannot come from home.

294
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:34,510
They would frighten me if they did,
for I shouldn't know them.

295
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,350
There is no hope.

296
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:45,680
- No hope for me at all!
- What's the matter, love?

297
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,555
Tilda's getting married to John Browdie.

298
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,754
I'll be the only girl in the county
who hasn't posted my banns.

299
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:54,991
John Browdie's no catch. I hate him.

300
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:56,624
Eat your breakfast.

301
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:58,932
I'll never eat again.

302
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,472
How do you like Mr. Knuckleboy?

303
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,035
I hate him, that's how I like him.

304
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:07,476
He's a nasty, stuck-up monkey.

305
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,541
He needs his pride brought down.

306
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:14,183
I'll leave that to you, my love.
There's not a woman in all England...

307
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:17,187
can bring a person's pride down
quicker than you can.

308
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:20,815
Thank you, Squeery.

309
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:24,388
Who's Mr. Knuckleboy?

310
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:25,928
The new teacher.

311
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:30,400
A smile like a sugar-drop,
and the straightest legs I've ever seen.

312
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,898
The word for "window"...

313
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:40,205
- Is "fenêtre", F-E-N-E...
- Oh, father.

314
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:45,206
I beg your pardon.
I thought my father was here.

315
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,685
- I'm so foolish, I'm sure.
- Not at all.

316
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:53,723
Again, the word for "window" is "fenêtre."

317
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:57,228
I'm sure I am foolish.

318
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:02,131
It's just my pen is in need of...

319
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:08,335
mending.

320
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,501
May I be of service?

321
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:14,602
No, I just couldn't.

322
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,507
All right.

323
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,815
Tilda!

324
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:27,121
- What is it, Fanny?
- I am engaged!

325
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:32,188
To whom?

326
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,632
- To the new schoolteacher.
- The speed of it!

327
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,196
What's he said?

328
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:42,369
We don't need language.
If you could have only seen his looks.

329
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,340
Did he look at you like this?

330
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:49,239
If he did, you're engaged.
That's how John looked at me.

331
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:52,044
Hope it was better than that.
Thee'd have run to the hills.

332
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,483
Hush, John! So, when is the day?

333
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:59,017
We just need a final declaration to settle it...

334
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,784
but he's shy in the way of words.

335
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,384
Fanny, I'm so happy for you.

336
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:53,073
Have you read The Pilgrim's Progress?

337
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,080
"The Pilgrim's Progress, by John Bunyan.

338
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:35,613
"As I walked through the wilderness
of this world, I lighted on a certain"...

339
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:38,121
What do you think you're doing?

340
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:42,389
Get on with your work!

341
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:47,895
Don't give me that high-and-mighty look.

342
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:50,091
He don't pay.

343
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:53,298
Therefore, he works.

344
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:05,241
Ladies.

345
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:13,581
Quick, I must do something
to engage his sympathy...

346
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:16,286
and bring him to the declaration.
Should I choke?

347
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:19,329
I think fainting might be more romantic
than choking.

348
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,102
Mr. Nickleby, help!

349
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:33,104
- What's happened?
- I think she was undone by your coldness.

350
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:36,079
Was I abrupt?
My mind, I'm afraid, was on other matters.

351
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:37,739
I'm sure it wasn't deliberate.

352
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:42,818
It's just that with all the feelings
so nearly expressed between you of late...

353
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:51,194
If I caused any distress,
I reproach myself most bitterly, but...

354
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:54,929
This is most awkward, but...

355
00:28:55,934 --> 00:29:00,394
- Does your friend think I'm in love with her?
- Does she think so? Of course.

356
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,966
But I've made no such declaration.

357
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:05,742
Your eyes said what your mouth could not.

358
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:09,271
Perhaps my mouth should say
what my eyes have not.

359
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:12,478
I have scarcely seen the young lady
three times...

360
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:16,577
but should I have seen her 30 or 30,000,
it would be the same.

361
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,918
I have not one thought,
hope or wish connected with her...

362
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:23,056
unless it be part of the picture
I keep in my mind...

363
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:26,653
of one day being able to turn my back
upon this accursed place...

364
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:31,099
and never to think of it again
with any feeling but loathing and disgust.

365
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,936
Refused by a teacher...

366
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:38,342
picked up by an advertisement.

367
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:42,068
He's insulted not just you,
but the whole house of Squeers.

368
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:46,473
He's proud. I said so from the start.

369
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:49,009
He must be wounded.

370
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:51,317
I hate him like poison!

371
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,050
Where is Smike? We need wood.

372
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:56,992
He's with Mr. Nickleby.
He waits on him hand and foot.

373
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:06,663
He must not have enough to do.

374
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:11,766
We must think of how better
to occupy our Smike.

375
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:28,192
They are so hard on me.

376
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,225
But for you...

377
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:34,421
they would kill me.

378
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:41,096
I fear they may be killing you because of me.

379
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:46,669
You will do better when I am gone.

380
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:47,978
Gone?

381
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:51,412
Are you going?

382
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,581
I would go tomorrow if I could.

383
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:58,517
Tell me...

384
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:01,616
is the world as bad as this place?

385
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,888
Oh, no.

386
00:31:04,796 --> 00:31:06,787
Should I ever meet you there?

387
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,091
- Why, yes, I'm sure at some...
- No.

388
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:12,065
Tell me.

389
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:16,129
Tell me that I should be sure to find you.

390
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:21,172
You would.

391
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,247
And I would help you and aid you...

392
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:29,343
and not bring fresh sorrow on you,
as I have done here.

393
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,223
He is not here, sir!

394
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:48,502
Show yourself!

395
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:58,712
Who knows where he is?

396
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,616
Please, sir, I think he's run away.

397
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:07,489
And what possible reason
would any boy have...

398
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:09,992
to run away from my establishment?

399
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:12,996
Do you think he's run away?

400
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,462
I hope so!

401
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:15,959
Squeery...

402
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,233
we best go find him.

403
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:31,440
But if you lift one finger...

404
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:34,783
to stop what's about to begin...

405
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:40,390
you and I will fall out in a way...

406
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:44,452
that will spoil your beauty.

407
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:55,332
Take pattern by Smike if you dare, boys!

408
00:32:57,442 --> 00:33:00,741
You'll see what he'll get for hisself
when he's brought back.

409
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,308
For brought back he will be.

410
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:10,114
You go the north way, Squeery,
I'll take the west.

411
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,791
Mr. Squeers!

412
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:19,796
Please!

413
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,331
I beg you, forgive the boy!
He is not in his right mind.

414
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:25,961
That will soon be the least of his problems.

415
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:34,509
Father, please don't let them find him.

416
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:37,381
If they do, let him be dead...

417
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:39,539
his last breath a free one.

418
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,074
Does he have him? Is it Smike?

419
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:10,401
Is she back with him?

420
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:13,071
Then you do not have him.

421
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:14,804
Thank God.

422
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:36,727
Squeery!

423
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,203
We have him!

424
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:48,872
Is every boy here?

425
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:51,146
Get back!

426
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:54,811
And you.

427
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:08,493
Have you anything to say?

428
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:13,435
Please, sir, spare me.

429
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:16,406
I'll spare you.

430
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:24,339
I'll flog you to within an inch of your life,
and I'll spare you then.

431
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,216
Stop!

432
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:41,260
This must not go on.

433
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:44,058
I will not allow it.

434
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:48,734
You dare to challenge my authority!

435
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:50,301
Stay back!

436
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:53,977
Touch him at your peril!

437
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:56,812
I will not stand by and see it done.

438
00:36:57,815 --> 00:36:59,646
You will do as you're told!

439
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:04,447
If you raise the devil within me, the
consequences shall fall on your own head!

440
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,455
Once I begin, God help you!

441
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:13,155
Stop!

442
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,226
No, please, wait!

443
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,144
I do not know why,
but I am going to show you...

444
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:30,874
what you have never shown any boy
in this room.

445
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:35,610
Pity.

446
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:16,759
Wait. I say, wait!

447
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:25,796
I've come from the schoolhouse.

448
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:29,636
Mr. Squeers says he was attacked.
Beaten, and nearly senseless.

449
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:33,643
When he said it was thee who did it,
I knew thee must not be allowed to leave...

450
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:35,235
We will not be stopped!

451
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:39,010
...without my shaking your hand,
and saying to thee, "Job well done."

452
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,210
Give us thee hand, will you?

453
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:43,452
Whoever heard the like of it?

454
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:45,521
I only wish...

455
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,458
I could've been there to see it myself.

456
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:56,096
What do thee mean to do now?

457
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:59,467
- I don't know.
- How much cash has thee got?

458
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,836
- Not much. But I'll find...
- Take what you need.

459
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:04,636
- I could not.
- Please.

460
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:09,945
Every boy in that room
would add to it if he could.

461
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:12,415
Thank you.

462
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,548
Here, and take this bit of timber, too,
to help thee on.

463
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:19,249
You keep a good heart.

464
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:21,884
God bless thee!

465
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:26,427
Beating the schoolmaster!

466
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:31,525
God, it's the best thing
I've heard in 20 years.

467
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,043
Tomorrow...

468
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,776
where will you go?

469
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:51,211
Perhaps to Liverpool.

470
00:39:52,289 --> 00:39:54,086
I could find work on a ship.

471
00:39:57,795 --> 00:39:59,262
Do not be anxious.

472
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,064
Before I do anything,
I will get you to your home.

473
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:04,861
Where is it?

474
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,007
You are my home.

475
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,438
Smike!

476
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:18,342
Please, may I go with you to the sea?

477
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,775
I will be your faithful,
hard-working servant. I will.

478
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:23,650
I promise I will.

479
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,419
I want only to be near you.

480
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:36,191
The word which separates us
shall never be said by me.

481
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:40,765
And I promise you, from this night forward...

482
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,366
the world shall deal by you as it does by me.

483
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:56,449
Do you have a family...

484
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:59,450
or are you alone, as I am?

485
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,990
I have a mother and a sister.

486
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:05,890
Dear God!

487
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:09,528
If he has sent me here,
what has he done to Kate?

488
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:11,433
I'm grateful that you came.

489
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:13,493
It is a boon to a single man...

490
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:16,631
to have such a lady as yourself
for my hostess.

491
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:19,538
I know little of how these things
are done in London.

492
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:22,943
Surely one of the other ladies
would be more adept.

493
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:25,548
You are the only lady present.

494
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,949
By the time I was finished,
she couldn't escape.

495
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:40,763
Have you thought about the investment
I brought you?

496
00:41:41,532 --> 00:41:44,126
It has its merits and its risks.

497
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:48,305
You know, Nickleby, I've noticed
you never seem to touch your wine...

498
00:41:48,372 --> 00:41:50,067
while we drink and drink.

499
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,165
I like to keep a clear head.

500
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:54,039
Yet you pour us so much.

501
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:57,080
I must say, it is a pleasure
having your niece with us.

502
00:41:57,147 --> 00:42:00,639
He must have designed that, too,
to soften you into speculating.

503
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:03,312
If I could see someone
as winning as Miss Nickleby...

504
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:05,287
when I talk business with her uncle...

505
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:08,119
I can think of no other place
I'd rather talk business.

506
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,886
No other place on Earth.

507
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:13,189
Hear, hear!

508
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:18,791
Gentlemen, I feel
we are boring Miss Nickleby.

509
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,565
Look, she can barely raise her eyes.

510
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:27,043
The poor dear girl simply cannot understand
why no one here is making love to her.

511
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,946
She gasps! I have uncovered her secret.

512
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:34,379
You misunderstand me.

513
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:36,783
In fact, I'll hold any man £50...

514
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:41,585
that Miss Nickleby can't look in my face
and tell me that she wasn't thinking so.

515
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:43,660
Done!

516
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,160
Pray, do not make me the subject of bets.

517
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,623
Uncle, please!

518
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:53,501
Why not, if the gentlemen insist?

519
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,394
It's a minute's work.

520
00:42:55,472 --> 00:43:00,239
Just lift your eyes and tell me that
you're not hoping I would make love to you.

521
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:05,982
Get your money ready, gentlemen.

522
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:10,714
She's not going to say it,
because she wants me to make love to her.

523
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,389
Can you, girl?

524
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:18,292
Can you say that you don't wish me
to make love to you?

525
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:50,216
Hush, my dear.

526
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:52,724
Don't mind it, now.

527
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:54,862
Then let me go.

528
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:57,664
Let me leave this place.

529
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,929
You must dry your eyes first.

530
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:04,673
Let me raise your head.

531
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:16,679
There.

532
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:27,030
Uncle...

533
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:32,190
what have I done
that you should subject me to this?

534
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,900
I didn't know it would be so.

535
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:56,121
Can you remember
when you first came to Mr. Squeers'?

536
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:58,861
Surely you did not
find your way there alone?

537
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:00,496
I could not have.

538
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:03,859
I was brought by a small, withered man.

539
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:05,568
I was afraid of him.

540
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:08,995
But then they made me more afraid of them.

541
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,913
Tremendous. Positively tremendous.

542
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:28,185
That'll be a double encore
if you take care, boys!

543
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:31,792
Don't you concur?
Was that not the very picture of excitement?

544
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:33,661
It was very good.

545
00:45:34,998 --> 00:45:37,091
- Although...
- Although?

546
00:45:37,835 --> 00:45:41,566
They might be better matched
in terms of size.

547
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:44,864
How are you to get up the sympathies
of the audience...

548
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:48,673
if there isn't a little man
contending against a bigger one?

549
00:45:48,812 --> 00:45:51,007
I confess, I had not considered that.

550
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:54,276
We have had a long day's walk
without much...

551
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:55,579
Without much?

552
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,851
Food.

553
00:45:58,222 --> 00:45:59,416
Dear me.

554
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:03,653
Let it never be said
that any man went hungry here or here...

555
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:05,627
when he was with Vincent Crummles.

556
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:07,823
Boys, set the table at once!

557
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:10,757
We shall adjourn to the dining room.

558
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:14,298
My friend and I
shall try for a berth on a ship.

559
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:20,542
Does no other profession suggest itself
to a young man of your figure and bearing?

560
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:23,837
- I think the sea offers a great many...
- What about the stage?

561
00:46:23,914 --> 00:46:26,508
- The stage?
- The theatrical profession!

562
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:30,986
I am in the theatrical profession myself.
My wife is in the theatrical profession.

563
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:33,679
My children are in the theatrical profession.

564
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:36,385
I had a dog that lived and died in it...

565
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:40,495
and the pony that pulled us here today
is third generation.

566
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:43,532
His mother could fire a pistol...

567
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,761
and get in bed wearing a nightcap.

568
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:46,936
But...

569
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:49,829
there is tragedy in the family.

570
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:53,738
- In the pony's family?
- Yes.

571
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:56,713
The father drank.

572
00:46:57,347 --> 00:46:59,406
Ended up in the circus...

573
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:02,417
drinking port wine with the clowns.

574
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:06,245
Got greedy, couldn't quit...

575
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,315
and choked on the bottle.

576
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,526
At any rate, I'd love
to bring you and your friend out.

577
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,499
He has a capital countenance!

578
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:19,229
Why, as he is now...

579
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:22,702
he would make such an apothecary
in Romeo and Juliet...

580
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:25,571
that he would be certain
of three rounds of applause...

581
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:28,634
the minute he put his face
out of the practicable door!

582
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:30,612
- And you!
- Me?

583
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:34,744
- You were born for the lamps!
- No, sir, I think...

584
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:38,151
You could be useful in a hundred ways.
You could write plays!

585
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:42,552
I dare say, I could scribble something,
now and then.

586
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:46,686
Whatever you write, please include a pump
and two washing tubs.

587
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:48,697
I just bought them at a sale.

588
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:51,032
Could I live by such a trade?

589
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:55,501
Like a prince!
With your own salary, and your friend's...

590
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:59,333
and your writing, you could make £1 a week!

591
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:02,435
With a good run of houses, double that.

592
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:06,172
Then I accept, and happily!

593
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:09,481
Arise, young man.

594
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,180
You've been transformed!

595
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:14,682
You went to sleep a wretch...

596
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:16,749
you awake an actor!

597
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:28,303
- Mrs. C, could I have a word?
- What is it now, Mr. Folair?

598
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:29,896
About my roar.

599
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:34,344
There are two options available to you.
A rugged...

600
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,673
My dear.

601
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:40,617
I've made another discovery.

602
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:45,445
Messieurs Nickleby and Smike,
may I present Mrs. Crummles.

603
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:49,089
Welcome to our family of players!

604
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:53,184
We were just about to rehearse
the climax of our drama.

605
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:55,231
Will you watch with us...

606
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,730
and feel with us?

607
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:03,006
Ladies and gentlemen, places, please.

608
00:49:04,374 --> 00:49:08,333
I must warn you,
Folair has been hopeless today!

609
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:19,051
Play the terror, but don't lose the joy!

610
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:23,148
Your trap!

611
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,726
Mr. Folair, shut your trap!

612
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:33,496
Somebody forgot his spear.

613
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:39,268
The flames! And remember, they're hot!

614
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:42,409
Oh, dear, it's almost too real!

615
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:46,272
Remember, Mr. Folair, you are a savage...

616
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:48,341
not a demented fairy!

617
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:50,784
Don't lose your theatricality!

618
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:55,483
Ninetta, dear, would you move
that flower to your other hand?

619
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:58,527
Mr. Folair, there's a problem with your head!

620
00:49:58,662 --> 00:49:59,629
Perfect!

621
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,167
Bravo!

622
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:06,760
Thrilling in the extreme!

623
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:08,931
Gentlemen...

624
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,197
this is Miss Ninetta Crummles...

625
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,138
the Infant Phenomenon.

626
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:15,074
How old is she?

627
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:21,176
She is 10 years of age, sir.

628
00:50:22,652 --> 00:50:23,641
Not more?

629
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:27,147
Not a day.

630
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:28,782
- My dear?
- Yes?

631
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:32,293
It is of the utmost that I speak to you
about a great struggle...

632
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:36,990
which is taking place outside
this mortal temple we call the theater.

633
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:40,263
The contestants are
those aged combatants...

634
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:41,628
art...

635
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:43,936
and commerce.

636
00:50:44,441 --> 00:50:47,308
And art, it would appear from the receipts...

637
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:50,244
is in its usual position of jeopardy.

638
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:54,149
Might you and I have a word, à deux?

639
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:56,013
Excusez-moi.

640
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:05,392
"Infant Phenomenon!"
"Infant humbug" is more to the point!

641
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:09,193
She has been 10 for the past 8 years!

642
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:13,433
They keep her on a diet of gin and water
to hold back her growth.

643
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:16,097
- You don't say!
- I do say, sir. I do!

644
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:20,237
That hammy sprawler keeps the rest of us
from doing our specialties.

645
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:23,711
Mine is the Highland Fling.

646
00:51:24,614 --> 00:51:26,605
Would you like to see it?

647
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:28,339
Please.

648
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:36,020
Ladies and gentlemen...

649
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:39,562
based on the receipts
Mrs. Crummles has shown me...

650
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:42,131
Liverpool has little relish...

651
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:47,134
for high-minded theatrical entertainments
properly conducted.

652
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,636
We must give them our pity.

653
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:56,506
Now, we must give them something
they will pay to see.

654
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,605
Romeo and Juliet.

655
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:02,948
But we have no Romeo.
Mr. Leadville's leg is broke.

656
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:07,720
I don't mind! I can manage!

657
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:10,987
Old friend...

658
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:14,430
it may be time
for you to move on from Romeo.

659
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:16,189
Move on?

660
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:17,993
To what?

661
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:20,561
Lear?

662
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:24,204
Mr. Nickleby will take that part.

663
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:28,267
And do you not think his friend
would make a smashing apothecary?

664
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:37,044
His face practically erupts with drama!

665
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:39,679
What an acquisition!

666
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,981
These speeches! Listen to this.

667
00:52:43,527 --> 00:52:46,291
"Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand...

668
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:48,729
"that I might touch that cheek."

669
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:51,266
Are you worried
about how to memorize so much?

670
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,894
I am, and I have barely a word to say!

671
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:55,560
It is not only that...

672
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:59,075
but a desire to know someone
to whom I could say such things.

673
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:04,537
My father told me that the great journey
of my life would be to find such a person...

674
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:08,909
but I'm nearly 20 years of age,
and I fear he may be wrong.

675
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:13,679
- I hope not.
- I hope not, too.

676
00:53:17,894 --> 00:53:22,263
May I ask you why you were so upset seeing
that savage come through the trapdoor?

677
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:28,103
You asked me yesterday if I had a memory
about my life before Yorkshire.

678
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,733
There is but one thing I remember.

679
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:34,201
It was the room in which I was kept.

680
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:39,043
It was a lonesome room
at the top of a house.

681
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:42,649
There was a large black hook
that hung down from the ceiling.

682
00:53:43,853 --> 00:53:46,151
Underneath it was a trapdoor.

683
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:51,590
I was so afraid of what might be
on the other side...

684
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:55,563
that there was not a single night
I did not cover my head in the bedclothes.

685
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,297
So today, when a door so very like it
opened in the dark before me...

686
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,870
I could not watch what came out of it.

687
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,308
Carry on.

688
00:54:14,451 --> 00:54:16,715
We have fallen on strange times.

689
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,213
Yes...

690
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:20,683
but wondrous strange.

691
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:37,804
- What's come then?
- I have.

692
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:43,371
- What else?
- A letter, marked:

693
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:47,941
"Urgent, as well as extremely important."

694
00:54:49,152 --> 00:54:50,813
It's from the Squeers.

695
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:52,586
Wackford?

696
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:54,983
Doubtful. It's perfumed.

697
00:54:57,761 --> 00:54:59,854
"Dear Mr. Knuckleboy, sir.

698
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:02,926
"My pa requests me to write to you.

699
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:05,433
"The doctor's considering it doubtful...

700
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:08,403
"whether he will ever recover
the use of his legs...

701
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:10,632
"which prevents his holding a pen.

702
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:13,999
"He was brought to this state
by your nephew...

703
00:55:14,077 --> 00:55:16,671
"who jumped upon my pa's body
with his feet...

704
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:18,475
"and dashed him to the earth."

705
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:21,142
"Dashed him to the earth."
Very nice, my dear!

706
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:23,878
"He also attacked him with language...

707
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:27,184
"which I will not pollute my pen
with describing.

708
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,618
"He assaulted my ma...

709
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:33,787
"by driving her back-comb several inches
into her head.

710
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:38,692
"We have a medical certificate that says,
if the comb had entered her skull...

711
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,827
"the tortoiseshell
might have affected her brain.

712
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:45,303
"The monster then ran away...

713
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:48,105
"taking with him a boy
of desperate character...

714
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:52,044
"as well as a garnet ring
belonging to my nearly dead ma.

715
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:55,916
"Would you please send us money
compensating for its loss...

716
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:58,112
"in the amount of 22..."

717
00:55:58,221 --> 00:55:59,415
- 4.
- 8.

718
00:56:00,457 --> 00:56:02,357
"£28.10.

719
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:05,651
"Remain yours, etc., Fanny Squeers."

720
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:08,423
The boy has crossed me.

721
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:12,899
- I did not expect otherwise.
- He's written as well.

722
00:56:13,837 --> 00:56:15,464
Pride, obstinacy.

723
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:19,606
A reputation for fine feelings
are all against it.

724
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:23,038
He's gone to Liverpool.

725
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,507
Taken some employment.

726
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,718
Otherwise it's all excuses.

727
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:32,418
I predict he soon will be on some ship.

728
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:34,782
Gone.

729
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:37,960
Forever.

730
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:48,337
Child...

731
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:52,873
forgive me. I have been remiss
in my attentions to you and your mother.

732
00:56:53,643 --> 00:56:57,477
I came to enquire whether you and she
would accompany me to the theater...

733
00:56:57,547 --> 00:56:58,946
on Friday evening?

734
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:01,484
That is most kind of you, Uncle.

735
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:03,150
Very well.

736
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:05,052
I shall call for you.

737
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:14,594
She has accepted.

738
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:30,342
I have a genuine interest in Shakespeare...

739
00:57:30,413 --> 00:57:34,611
especially after having been
to that dear little dull house he was born in.

740
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:36,713
How fascinating. May I?

741
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,118
Nickleby? Is that you?

742
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:41,987
Nickleby, are you all alone?

743
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:44,786
What luck!

744
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:52,691
The drama begins.

745
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:59,298
Her eyes in heaven...

746
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:03,209
would through the airy region
stream so bright...

747
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:06,982
that birds would sing,
and think it were not night.

748
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:11,109
See how she leans her cheek
upon her hand.

749
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:14,352
Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand...

750
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:16,425
that I might touch that cheek!

751
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,857
Ay, me!

752
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:21,254
I should like to be your glove...

753
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:23,964
as much to touch your cheek...

754
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:26,160
as to grip your fingers.

755
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:28,864
Bravo!

756
00:58:32,475 --> 00:58:35,103
- Don't hurry.
- Please do not detain me.

757
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,976
Now, why do you keep up
this show of displeasure?

758
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:41,445
Show? Nothing could be more sincerely felt.

759
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:44,746
Indeed, you're prettier
when you are in a passion.

760
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:49,087
I wish my brother were here. He'd be in a
passion from which you'd not soon recover.

761
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:52,150
Linger with me just a moment
as they extinguish the lights.

762
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:53,217
I will not.

763
00:58:53,296 --> 00:58:56,891
- Will you deny me everything I want?
- Lf everything you want is wrong.

764
00:58:56,966 --> 00:58:59,867
Please, let me rejoin my family.
My mother will be anxious.

765
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:04,066
Your mother, child, is already anxious
that you should find a proper prospect.

766
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:07,166
I would hazard that she is delighted
we are by ourselves...

767
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:10,838
and I imagine the longer we are gone,
the less anxious she will be.

768
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:14,280
Do not mock me.
You do not consider me a prospect...

769
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:16,910
but a plaything, and I consider you neither.

770
00:59:17,654 --> 00:59:21,181
To treat me this way in a public place
could ruin my reputation.

771
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:24,718
And every chance for a decent
and loving marriage will be gone.

772
00:59:24,794 --> 00:59:29,754
If it's privacy you want, let me give it to you.
But I'll have what I want and wait no more.

773
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:39,370
I have a genuine interest in Shakespeare.

774
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:41,075
Mother, may we go?

775
00:59:41,377 --> 00:59:43,038
It was delightful to see you.

776
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:45,637
- Mother, please.
- Is something wrong?

777
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:53,016
Uncle...

778
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:56,817
I have been wounded past all healing...

779
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:00,458
and by your friends.

780
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:02,930
What can you mean? I have no friends.

781
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:07,293
If they are not your friends, then more
shame on you for bringing me among them.

782
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:10,305
I see you have
some of the boy's blood in you.

783
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:14,004
I hope I have.

784
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:16,369
I should be proud.

785
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:21,314
You know what happened under this roof.

786
01:00:22,885 --> 01:00:25,046
Last night was far worse.

787
01:00:26,756 --> 01:00:28,724
You have influence with these men.

788
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:31,487
One word from you would induce
them to desist.

789
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:36,225
What of it if an old man whispers
inanities in your ear on Monday?

790
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,631
Some other novelty
will spring up on Tuesday.

791
01:00:38,701 --> 01:00:41,397
In the meantime, you must be practical.

792
01:00:41,604 --> 01:00:44,300
The money that allows me
to help you and your mother...

793
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:47,366
in some portion comes from these men.

794
01:00:50,446 --> 01:00:51,413
Uncle...

795
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:56,811
I am grateful
for all that you have done for us...

796
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,850
but do not mistake me.

797
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,348
I am not a toy.

798
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:07,060
I will live with dignity.

799
01:01:08,564 --> 01:01:09,656
If that means...

800
01:01:09,732 --> 01:01:12,792
that I must set up my mother
and myself on our own...

801
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:15,497
and hide myself from your friends...

802
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:18,031
I will do so...

803
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:22,808
knowing God will help us,
even if you will not.

804
01:01:32,221 --> 01:01:34,553
If the boy drowns, or is lost at sea...

805
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:38,323
this house could be hers.

806
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:42,595
How pretty she would make it.

807
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:48,804
Dear girl, here. Take this.

808
01:01:49,405 --> 01:01:50,872
But I am not crying.

809
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:54,068
The handkerchief's for me.
The arm's for you.

810
01:01:55,912 --> 01:01:59,143
To hear you speak so bravely
and not give way before him...

811
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:03,514
My admiration moves me to this.
Your brother, he'd be so proud.

812
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:09,656
That's right, yes. Give way now.

813
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:12,254
Noggs!

814
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:20,569
You're not alone. I'll see you soon.
And so shall someone else.

815
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:23,571
God bless you.

816
01:02:40,056 --> 01:02:43,150
Again. "What ho! Apothecary!"

817
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:46,255
It's no use. I can't remember it.

818
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:48,695
Smike, you can only fail by not trying.

819
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:51,464
"Who calls so loud?"

820
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:55,402
It is a crime that Mr. C has not found a spot
for my Highland Fling.

821
01:02:55,705 --> 01:02:58,435
Romeo and Juliet
will not be the same without it.

822
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:00,304
"Who calls so loud?"

823
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:04,005
- May I tempt you with a humble offering?
- Please.

824
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:08,049
The lamps are lit! Your public awaits!

825
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:12,145
Let us use our bodies like instruments...

826
01:03:12,221 --> 01:03:16,487
and quiver together until music comes out!

827
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:23,225
You will be wonderful. Just relax.

828
01:03:25,034 --> 01:03:26,194
Relax.

829
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:33,366
"Who calls so loud?"

830
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:38,440
If a man did need a poison...

831
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:41,550
here lives a caitiff wretch
who would sell it to him.

832
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:44,346
What ho! Apothecary!

833
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:55,760
What ho?

834
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:36,965
Who calls so loud?

835
01:04:39,342 --> 01:04:40,639
Well done.

836
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:48,278
Mr. Nickleby?

837
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:51,353
- This just came.
- Thank you.

838
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:56,556
If it is an offer from a competing company...

839
01:04:56,626 --> 01:04:59,720
I hope you honor it
with the respect it deserves...

840
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:01,121
none.

841
01:05:01,797 --> 01:05:04,459
Newman says Kate is in some sort of peril.

842
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,997
He says we must come to London at once.

843
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:11,028
You leave us?
At the very moment of your triumph?

844
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:15,371
- I must, sir. It is a family drama.
- Those are always popular.

845
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:21,278
We shall miss you, Nicholas.

846
01:05:22,685 --> 01:05:25,347
Very well, we'll have posters
out in the morning...

847
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:28,618
announcing positively
your last performance for tomorrow.

848
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:31,660
Then re-engagement
by popular demand for Friday.

849
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:36,558
And then, one absolutely
last-time-ever appearance...

850
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:38,758
on any stage, Saturday...

851
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:43,898
with the possibility
of a second show to follow.

852
01:05:44,807 --> 01:05:48,334
No man has been more helpful
to me in my time of trouble than you...

853
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:51,812
but I must say that tonight
was my absolutely, positively...

854
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:53,872
final last performance.

855
01:05:53,983 --> 01:05:57,919
There is an urgent family crisis.
I must be no less quick in responding to it...

856
01:05:57,987 --> 01:06:01,650
than you would be if the Infant Phenomenon
herself were in danger.

857
01:06:08,931 --> 01:06:11,161
There is only one response to that.

858
01:06:13,602 --> 01:06:16,696
Farewell, my noble, lion-hearted boy.

859
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:20,039
- We shall never forget you.
- Nor we you.

860
01:06:20,676 --> 01:06:23,406
And have you anything to say, my boy?

861
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,845
Who calls so loud?

862
01:06:32,388 --> 01:06:35,323
- Goodbye. Thank you.
- Farewell, dear friends.

863
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:37,424
Ladies and gentlemen...

864
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:40,951
if you found these goodbyes affecting...

865
01:06:41,097 --> 01:06:45,557
you will love our production
of Romeo and Juliet...

866
01:06:45,735 --> 01:06:49,865
miraculously recast
with that great Italian actor...

867
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:52,132
whose name shall be revealed...

868
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:55,969
only to ticket buyers
at tonight's performance...

869
01:06:56,212 --> 01:06:59,204
but who promises,
in honor of the local tastes...

870
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:02,614
to deftly insert into tonight's story...

871
01:07:03,586 --> 01:07:05,816
the Highland Fling.

872
01:07:17,233 --> 01:07:18,757
Mr. Noggs is in here?

873
01:07:19,168 --> 01:07:21,363
He said for us to wait for him here.

874
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:24,063
Shall I get you something to eat?

875
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:27,665
- It may be some time before Newman arrives.
- Yes, please.

876
01:07:27,777 --> 01:07:30,473
Not as much as little Kate Nickleby!

877
01:07:32,948 --> 01:07:35,917
Tell us again what she said
in Nickleby's box.

878
01:07:36,018 --> 01:07:38,384
She said she wished
her brother were there...

879
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:41,651
as he would be in a passion
that I would not soon forget!

880
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:47,420
Didn't she also say something about,
"If you press yourself further...

881
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:50,693
"I shall lose every hope
of a loving and decent marriage"?

882
01:07:50,766 --> 01:07:52,427
I thought that was a bit much.

883
01:07:52,501 --> 01:07:54,264
A word with you, sir.

884
01:07:58,407 --> 01:08:00,102
Will you step apart with me?

885
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:05,071
I see no reason to step in any direction
until you state your name and business, sir.

886
01:08:05,781 --> 01:08:09,774
My name is Nicholas Nickleby.
Miss Nickleby's brother.

887
01:08:10,186 --> 01:08:13,383
I denounce you as a liar
and impeach you as a coward.

888
01:08:13,656 --> 01:08:16,489
- You will tell me your name.
- Certainly not.

889
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:20,088
If there is a gentleman in this party...

890
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:23,563
he will acquaint me with the name
and residence of this man.

891
01:08:25,468 --> 01:08:27,436
Someone answer me!

892
01:08:28,003 --> 01:08:30,699
My sister's good name is at stake!

893
01:08:31,173 --> 01:08:33,198
This dog is bothering me.

894
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:35,470
I am the son of a country gentleman...

895
01:08:35,644 --> 01:08:37,612
your equal in education and birth...

896
01:08:37,713 --> 01:08:40,682
and your superior, I trust,
in everything besides.

897
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:45,580
It is as much in his name as it is in my own,
that I demand you answer for your conduct.

898
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:47,952
Here is my answer, sir.

899
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,158
Now, gentlemen.

900
01:08:52,862 --> 01:08:53,829
No!

901
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:02,734
Come near my sister again...

902
01:09:03,072 --> 01:09:05,233
and I shall not be so forgiving.

903
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:13,110
The Exchange is now open for business.

904
01:09:39,074 --> 01:09:41,099
You are known to me now...

905
01:09:41,477 --> 01:09:43,877
every suspicion viciously confirmed.

906
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,977
And you to me.

907
01:09:47,283 --> 01:09:49,877
I? What wrong have I done?

908
01:09:49,952 --> 01:09:51,920
Did you not attack the schoolmaster?

909
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:54,353
The monster was beating a crippled boy!

910
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:57,117
You choose to restore that boy?

911
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:59,821
No more than I would restore
a lamb to a wolf.

912
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:03,421
Then your appearance here
to beg my help is in vain.

913
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:07,965
You mistake the point of this conference.

914
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:11,431
We knew no shame until we knew you...

915
01:10:12,007 --> 01:10:14,168
and the degradations we have endured...

916
01:10:14,276 --> 01:10:18,610
whether at Dotheboys Hall
or in the dark box of a theatre...

917
01:10:19,248 --> 01:10:21,842
all trace their poisoned roots to you.

918
01:10:23,586 --> 01:10:25,747
You did not want us when we came...

919
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:29,348
and it shamed me to seek help
from someone unwilling to give it.

920
01:10:30,526 --> 01:10:34,292
Now our only shame is the blood
which binds our name to yours.

921
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:38,356
Therefore, your brother's widow
and her children renounce you!

922
01:10:40,436 --> 01:10:44,896
May every recollection of your life cast
a terrifying darkness over your deathbed.

923
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,642
How soon that day may come,
I cannot know.

924
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:52,510
But I do know that in our life,
you live no more.

925
01:10:53,482 --> 01:10:54,471
I disown him.

926
01:10:55,317 --> 01:10:57,945
I would give good money
to have him stabbed...

927
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:00,784
and rolled into the kennels
for the dogs to devour.

928
01:11:00,889 --> 01:11:02,083
As would I.

929
01:11:02,224 --> 01:11:05,716
But I am sure he's left London
in fear of my retribution.

930
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:08,623
Oh, indeed, sir, he has not.

931
01:11:09,398 --> 01:11:12,060
I saw him just now in the city...

932
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:14,726
boasting of his triumphal attack over you.

933
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:16,299
I don't believe it.

934
01:11:16,372 --> 01:11:20,035
You were there last night, Lord Verisopht.
I wager you could believe it.

935
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:22,109
I'll tell you what I believe.

936
01:11:23,312 --> 01:11:25,803
I believe you have
only yourself to blame, Hawk.

937
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:27,006
What?

938
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:30,550
If you had only told him who you were,
as he asked.

939
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:33,455
I was wrong, too, not to interfere.

940
01:11:33,522 --> 01:11:35,649
I did not sleep the night, thinking about it.

941
01:11:35,724 --> 01:11:38,955
Whatever mistakes were made,
were made by the boy.

942
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:43,261
I am his uncle,
and even I can see that he is no good.

943
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:46,328
He was defending the honor of his sister.

944
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:49,394
That is the very definition of goodness.

945
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,298
How can you not be proud of what
he's done in defense of your own niece?

946
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:57,504
You will be glad, my Lord, that I possess...
