  THE POLICE IN
 WEST MEMPHIS, ARKANSAS

10
00:01:38,564 --> 00:01:41,033
CONFIRMED TODAY THAT THREE YOUNG
  BOYS WERE BRUTALLY MURDERED.

11
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,870
  THE BODIES OF WEAVER
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SECOND GRADERS

12
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:46,805
 STEVEN BRANCH,
   CHRISTOPHER BYERS,
AND MICHAEL MOORE

13
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,975
WERE PULLED FROM
 A SHALLOW CREEK EARLIER TODAY.

14
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:51,945
 THERE ARE RUMORS THAT THE BOYS
MAY HAVE BEEN SEXUALLY MUTILATED

15
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:53,980
 THE POLICE SAY
  THAT THEY DO NOT YET

16
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,048
HAVE ANY SUSPECTS
  IN THE CASE.

17
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,051
   THE MISSING 8-YEAR-OLD BOYS
 WERE DISCOVERED

18
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,885
   IN AN AREA KNOWN AS
ROBIN HOOD HILLS,

19
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:01,721
A SECLUDED PATCH OF WOODS

20
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,522
   BEHIND THE
 BLUE BEACON TRUCK WASH

21
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,558
   ALONG INTERSTATE 40
IN WEST MEMPHIS.

22
00:02:11,864 --> 00:02:15,033
( woman )
IMAGINE ALL THE EVIL
THAT YOU COULD THINK OF,

23
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:17,970
HOW SOMEONE
COULD BE MURDERED

24
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:21,306
AND THAT'S HOW THESE
THREE CHILDREN DIED.

25
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,811
( man )
NO FAMILY SHOULD
HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS,

26
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,879
   UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S GONNA
   HAPPEN AGAIN SOMEWHERE,

27
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:28,715
   ANOTHER TOWN,

28
00:02:28,814 --> 00:02:31,518
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN,
I'M SURE,

29
00:02:31,617 --> 00:02:34,920
 A LOT OF BAD PEOPLE
 OUT THERE IN THE WORLD.

30
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,923
( man )
I DON'T KNOW WHY THESE
THREE LITTLE BOYS WERE MURDERED,

31
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:40,960
DID THEY SEE SOMETHING THEY
WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO SEE ?

32
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,695
DID THEY HEAR THINGS
THEY WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO HEAR ?

33
00:02:43,795 --> 00:02:45,497
I DO NOT KNOW THAT,

34
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,967
I SEE NO REASON,
I SEE NO MOTIVE

35
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:51,104
FOR WHY THESE THREE
LITTLE BOYS WERE MURDERED.

00:03:42,754 --> 00:03:44,924
   ECHOLS AND BALDWIN
  RAPED ONE OF THE BOYS

56
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,128
AS PART OF A CULT RITUAL.

00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,868
   BUT THAT HE HELPED SUBDUE

60
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:57,971
 ONE VICTIM WHO TRIED TO ESCAPE.

61
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,740
 AT A PRESS CONFERENCE,
  INSPECTOR GARY GITCHELL SAID

62
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,277
  THE CASE AGAINST THE ACCUSED
  TEENS IS VERY STRONG.

63
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,412
( reporter )
ONE A SCALE OF 1 TO 10,
HOW SOLID IS THE CASE ?

64
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:07,713
  ELEVEN.

( Jenna )
   IT APPEARS SATANIC WORSHIP

67
00:04:13,552 --> 00:04:15,587
 MAY HAVE PLAYED
 A ROLE IN THE MURDERS.

68
00:04:15,687 --> 00:04:18,190
SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING
  OF THE INVESTIGATION

69
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,892
 PEOPLE ALL AROUND WEST MEMPHIS
HAVE COME FORWARD

70
00:04:20,992 --> 00:04:23,997
  WITH STORIES
OF SATANIC CULTS.

71
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:26,632
REV. TOMMY STACY'S CHURCH
   IS DOWN THE STREET

72
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:29,668
  FROM WHERE THE BODIES
   WERE FOUND.

73
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,771
  ONE YEAR AGO DAMIEN ECHOLS
TOLD THE CHURCH'S YOUTH MINISTER

74
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,874
  HE HAD A PACT WITH THE DEVIL

75
00:04:34,973 --> 00:04:37,009
AND HE WAS GOING TO HELL.

76
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,113
( Stacy )
I DO KNOW THAT
MY YOUTH DIRECTOR

77
00:04:41,213 --> 00:04:43,483
TALKED TO DAMIEN EXTENSIVELY

78
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,885
AT THE REVIVAL THAT WE HAD

79
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:48,454
AND HE TOLD HIM
THAT HE COULD NOT BE SAVED.

80
00:04:48,553 --> 00:04:51,056
THAT HE COULD NOT
GIVE HIS HEART TO JESUS

81
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:52,891
AND MY YOUTH DIRECTOR THEN

82
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,961
TRIED TO GET HIM
TO TAKE A BIBLE

83
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,262
AND HE MADE THE STATEMENT
THAT HE COULD NOT TAKE A BIBLE

84
00:04:57,362 --> 00:04:59,632
BECAUSE IF HE DID,
THE REST OF 'EM WOULD GET HIM.

CHRISTOPHER NEVER
HURT ANYBODY.

88
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,809
HE HAD A GENTLE,
LOVING AND GIVING HEART.

89
00:05:09,908 --> 00:05:12,010
AND THEY CRUCIFIED HIM
IN THOSE WOODS,

90
00:05:13,644 --> 00:05:16,915
AND THEY HUMILIATED
HIS LITTLE BODY.

91
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,785
THEY TOOK
HIS LITTLE MANHOOD

92
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:20,986
BEFORE HE EVEN
KNEW WHAT IT WAS.

93
00:05:22,987 --> 00:05:24,891
AND I HATE 'EM FOR IT.

94
00:05:25,923 --> 00:05:28,394
I'VE NEVER HATED ANYBODY
IN MY<i> LIFE.</i>

95
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,665
AND I HATE THESE THREE.

96
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,536
AND THE MOTHERS

97
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,771
THAT BORE THEM.

98
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,810
I CAN'T IMAGINE...

99
00:05:45,644 --> 00:05:48,947
WHAT WAS GOING
THROUGH MICHAEL'S MIND.

100
00:05:49,947 --> 00:05:51,850
 WAS HE...

101
00:05:53,017 --> 00:05:54,720

102
00:05:56,487 --> 00:05:59,158
( Todd )
HOW LONG DID THEY
LEAVE HIM THERE TIED UP

103
00:05:59,257 --> 00:06:01,661
ON THAT DITCH BANK BEFORE
THEY DECIDED TO KILL HIM ?

104
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,130
WHAT WERE THEY
DOING TO HIM ?

105
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,999
WAS HE CONSCIOUS
OR UNCONSCIOUS ?

106
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:10,235
   DID HE WATCH
   THE OTHER TWO BOYS...

107
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,905
   GET CUT ?

108
00:06:13,004 --> 00:06:15,641
( Todd )
HE WAS REALLY BEING KILLED
BY REAL MONSTERS.

00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,795
  IT'S STEVIE'S
  BOY SCOUT,

 I GOT IT
 BACK YESTERDAY.

00:06:39,064 --> 00:06:42,300
   AND, I'VE BEEN WEARING IT
   AROUND MY HEAD LIKE THIS.

116
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,572
DID HE
LIKE SCOUTING ?

117
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,474
OH, HE LOVED IT,
HE LOVED IT.

118
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,343
HE LOVED IT.

119
00:06:50,442 --> 00:06:53,211

DO YOU BLAME YOURSELF
FOR THIS ?

120
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,114
 ( Pam )
 I HAVE, I HAVE,

121
00:06:55,213 --> 00:06:57,817
I HAVE BEEN
ON A GUILT TRIP ABOUT IT

122
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,218
 BUT, IT WASN'T MY FAULT

123
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,788
 I WAS AT WORK.

124
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:05,024
HAVE YOU CONTEMPLATED
JOINING STEVIE ?

125
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:06,826
HAVE I ?

126
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:09,896
HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT SUICIDE ?

127
00:07:09,995 --> 00:07:11,596
HAVE I ?

128
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,800
 UH, "SUICIDE" ?

129
00:07:15,934 --> 00:07:18,905
I FELT LIKE DYING,
BUT NOT SUICIDE, NO,

130
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:21,206
NOT SUICIDE.

131
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:24,076
DO YOU FEEL THAT THE PEOPLE
THAT DID THIS WERE WORSHIPPING--

132
00:07:24,175 --> 00:07:25,110
SATAN ?

133
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,646
  YES, I DO.

134
00:07:26,745 --> 00:07:27,947
WHY ?

135
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,916
JUST LOOK AT THE FREAKS.

136
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,884
   JUST LOOK AT 'EM.

137
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:33,985
   THEY LOOK LIKE PUNKS.

138
00:07:58,843 --> 00:08:00,947
LITTLE JESSIE TOLD ME
HE DIDN'T DO IT,

139
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,449
DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH IT, HE WASN'T THERE.

140
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,252
I BELIEVE<i> HIM.</i>

141
00:08:09,588 --> 00:08:12,458
( Jessie Sr. )
I THINK THE COPS JUST
CAN'T FIND WHO DONE IT...

142
00:08:13,858 --> 00:08:15,794
AND THEY GOTTA
PUT IT ON SOMEBODY.

143
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:20,733
I WANNA TELL THE WHOLE WORLD
MY SON'S INNOCENT

144
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,102
 BECAUSE I KNOW
 HE<i> IS</i> INNOCENT.

145
00:08:24,168 --> 00:08:25,971

 I KNOW WHERE HE WAS

146

147
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,977
   AND I WANNA TELL THE WORLD
   AND I WANT THE WORLD TO KNOW.

148
00:08:34,712 --> 00:08:37,082
  THIS BOY
  IS NOT CAPABLE

149
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:38,551
 OF THE CRIME

150
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,853
  THAT HE HAS
  BEEN ARRESTED FOR.

151
00:08:41,953 --> 00:08:43,788
I'VE SEEN HIM
TAKE A LITTLE KITTEN

152
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:45,858
   AND LOVE IT JUST LIKE

153
00:08:45,957 --> 00:08:48,026
   YOU'D LOVE A LITTLE BABY.

154
00:08:48,126 --> 00:08:50,161
  IT'S LIKE A NIGHTMARE,

155
00:08:50,261 --> 00:08:52,797
 A NIGHTMARE THAT
 YOU CAN'T WAKE UP FROM.

156
00:08:52,898 --> 00:08:54,466
OUR SON IS INNOCENT.

157
00:08:56,234 --> 00:08:58,104
  WE INTEND TO PROVE IT.

158
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:03,109
  ( man )
  "YAY, THOUGH
  I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY

159
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,910

  BECAUSE HE'S NOT
  GONNA HELP YA.

169
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,672
 HE'S GONNA LAUGH AT YA,
 MOCK AT YA, AND TORTURE YA.

170
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,574
 HE DIDN'T NEED YOUR HELP.

171
00:09:34,673 --> 00:09:36,908
 THE DEVIL'S GOT
 ALL THE DEVILS HE NEEDS.

172
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,911
 THE GOOD LORD SAID LUCIFER,

173
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,413
 AND A THIRD OF THE ANGELS
 WERE CAST FROM HEAVEN.

174
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,749
 HE DIDN'T NEED THEM,
 BUT HE TOOK THEIR MIND

175
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:45,685
 AND HE MANIPULATED 'EM,

176
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:48,486
AND THEY PRAYED TO SATAN
AND THEY PRAYED TO THE DEVIL

177
00:09:48,586 --> 00:09:51,356
AND THEY HAD THEIR SATANIC
WORSHIP SERVICES OUT HERE,

178
00:09:51,456 --> 00:09:54,460
AND THEY HAD ALL TYPES
OF WILD HOMOSEXUAL ORGIES

179
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,494
I'VE BEEN TOLD,

180
00:09:56,595 --> 00:09:58,564
CRAZY THINGS.

181
00:09:58,663 --> 00:10:01,133
TO ME,
THIS PLACE AS I STAND

182
00:10:01,232 --> 00:10:03,635
IS LIKE HELL ON EARTH

183
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:06,371
BECAUSE I KNOW
THAT THREE BABIES

184
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:10,009
WERE KILLED RIGHT OUT HERE
WERE I STAND.

185
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,110
I KNOW MY SON WAS CASTRATED

186
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,346
AND POSSIBLY
LAYED THERE ON THAT BANK

187
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,514
AND BLED TO DEATH.

188
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:18,618
I KNOW HE WAS CHOKED.

189
00:10:18,717 --> 00:10:21,853
I KNOW ONE BOY'S HEAD
WAS BEAT IN BEYOND RECOGNITION.

190
00:10:21,953 --> 00:10:23,788
I KNOW ONE LITTLE BOY
WAS SKINNED

191
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,858
ALMOST LIKE AN ANIMAL,

192
00:10:25,957 --> 00:10:28,760
CUT, HAD TO SHAVE HIS HEAD,

193
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,895
HAD ALL TYPES

194
00:10:30,995 --> 00:10:33,098
OF INJURES TO THE HEAD

195
00:10:33,198 --> 00:10:35,067
WHERE THEY JUST
KEPT BEATING HIM

196
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,103
AND POUNDIN' ON HIM,
AND KILLIN' HIM AND KILLIN' HIM

197
00:10:37,202 --> 00:10:39,071
IT'S LIKE THEY ENJOYED IT,

198
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,607
THEY KILLED THEM
TWO OR THREE TIMES.

199
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,442
JESSIE MISSKELLEY JR,

200
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,645
JASON BALDWIN,

201
00:10:46,745 --> 00:10:48,547
DAMIEN ECHOLS,

202
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:50,549
I HOPE YOUR MASTER THE DEVIL

203
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:52,618
DOES TAKE YOU SOON.

204
00:10:52,717 --> 00:10:54,719
I WANT YOU TO
MEET HIM<i> REAL</i> SOON.

205
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,722
AND THE DAY YOU DIE

206
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,557
I'M GONNA PRAISE GOD

207
00:10:58,657 --> 00:11:00,593
AND I MAKE YOU
A PROMISE,

208
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:02,495
THE DAY YOU DIE,

209
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,463
EVERY YEAR ON MAY 5TH

210
00:11:04,562 --> 00:11:06,698
I'M GONNA COME
TO YOUR GRAVE SIDE,

211
00:11:06,798 --> 00:11:08,800
I'M GONNA SPIT ON YOU,

212
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,770
I'M GONNA CURSE
THE DAY YOU WERE BORN,

213
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,805
AND I'M SURE
WHILE I'M STANDIN' THERE

214
00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:16,808
I'M GONNA HAVE TO HAVE
OTHER BODILY FUNCTIONS

215
00:11:16,908 --> 00:11:18,510
LET GO UPON YOUR GRAVE.

216
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,047
I PROMISE YOU
AS GOD IS MY WITNESS

217
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,716
I'LL VISIT ALL THREE
OF YOUR GRAVES.

218
00:11:33,491 --> 00:11:35,694
THE STATEMENT
JESSIE GAVE TO THE POLICE

219
00:11:35,794 --> 00:11:38,264
IS A LIE,
IT'S NOT TRUE.

220
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,232
I DON'T SEE WHY HE WOULD
DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT

221
00:11:40,331 --> 00:11:42,033
TO ANOTHER PERSON.

222
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,437
I CAN SEE WHY THEY MIGHT THINK
I WAS IN A CULT

223
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,673
 'CAUSE I WEAR<i>
 METALLICA</i> T-SHIRTS AND STUFF.

224
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,009
BUT, I'M NOT IN
NOTHIN' LIKE THAT.

225
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,245
 I COULDN'T KILL AN ANIMAL<i>
 OR</i> A PERSON.

226
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,082
I DON'T WORSHIP THE DEVIL
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

227
00:12:00,184 --> 00:12:01,720
I WORSHIP GOD

228
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:05,124
LIKE EVERY NORMAL PERSON
AROUND HERE DOES.

229
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,326
I GOT A FAVORITE PET,
MY PET IGUANA.

230
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,163
HAD HER FOR A LITTLE
OVER A YEAR NOW.

231
00:12:12,062 --> 00:12:13,765
I USUALLY GO FISHIN'
BY MYSELF,

232
00:12:13,865 --> 00:12:15,735
RIGHT IN MY BACKYARD.

233
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,637
JUST GO OUT THERE, AND MY
PET CAT WOULD BE OUT THERE

234
00:12:18,736 --> 00:12:20,639
HIS NAME'S CHARLIE.

235
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:23,242
WHENEVER I CATCH A FISH
I ALWAYS GIVE IT TO HIM.

236
00:12:23,341 --> 00:12:25,110
I DIDN'T KILL THESE
THREE LITTLE BOYS.

237
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:28,047
I DIDN'T KILL
THOSE THREE LITTLE BOYS.

238
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:29,949
THEY WERE UNDER
A LOT OF PRESSURE

239
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:32,117
THEY HAD TO FIND<i> SOMEBODY</i>

240
00:12:32,217 --> 00:12:33,586
TO LAY THIS OFF ON

241
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,821
BEFORE PEOPLE
STARTED LOSIN' THEIR JOBS.

242
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,723
THE PUBLIC WAS
GETTIN' REAL UPSET

243
00:12:37,822 --> 00:12:39,924
SEEIN' THE COPS
WERE INCOMPETENT,

244
00:12:40,024 --> 00:12:42,961
COULDN'T DO THEIR JOBS,
THEY HAD TO DO SOMETHING FAST.

245
00:12:43,928 --> 00:12:46,097
AND WE WERE REALLY
THE OBVIOUS CHOICE

246
00:12:46,197 --> 00:12:48,500
BECAUSE WE STOOD OUT
FROM EVERYBODY ELSE.

247
00:12:52,937 --> 00:12:55,140
THIS ALL WORKED OUT
TO THEIR ADVANTAGE.

248
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,120
( man )
NO ONE'S GONNA BE SAYING THAT
YOU'RE STUPID OR YOU'RE DUMB,

249
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,990
OR MAKING FUN OF YOU,

250
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,493
BUT THE COURT'S GONNA BE
VERY INTERESTED IN DETERMINING

251
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:17,163
EXACTLY AT WHAT LEVEL
YOU WERE FUNCTIONING,

252
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:19,598
HOW WELL
YOU'RE ABLE TO READ,

253
00:13:19,697 --> 00:13:22,999
HOW WELL YOU'RE ABLE TO WRITE,
THINGS OF THAT NATURE.

254
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,701
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE ?

255
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:24,769
 MM-HMM.

256
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,971
SO, IF THE COURT
DETERMINES THAT

257
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,207
YOU ARE OPERATING

258
00:13:29,307 --> 00:13:31,009
BELOW AVERAGE,

259
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,512
THEN THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT
THE COURT WILL NOT BE ALLOWED

260
00:13:33,611 --> 00:13:35,880
OR THE STATE
WILL NOT BE ALLOWED

261
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,649
TO IMPOSE
THE DEATH PENALTY AGAINST YOU,

262
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,350
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT THAT MEANS ?

263
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:41,754
WE'VE GOT
ABOUT 10 WEEKS

264
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,556
BEFORE THE TRIAL
COMES UP IN JANUARY.

265
00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:47,091
ARE YOU LOOKING FORWARD
TO HAVING THE TRIAL ?

266
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,894
   A LITTLE BIT.

267
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:50,962
 NOT MUCH.

268
00:13:51,062 --> 00:13:51,563
( phone rings )

269
00:14:00,437 --> 00:14:02,073
HELLO ?

270
00:14:02,173 --> 00:14:03,975
  ( operator )
  I have a collect call,
  your name please.

271
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,043
( man )
Jessie.

272
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,010
  ( operator )
  Will you pay ?

273
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,078
YES, MA'AM.

274
00:14:07,178 --> 00:14:07,846
  Thank you.

275
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,648
HEY, SON,
HOW YA DOIN' ?

276
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:10,682
Alright.

277
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,685
THAT'S GOOD.

278
00:14:12,784 --> 00:14:14,853
 My hand
still hurts.

279
00:14:14,953 --> 00:14:17,088
YOUR HAND STILL HURTS ?

280
00:14:17,188 --> 00:14:18,490
DID YOU EVER FIND OUT
IF IT WAS BROKE OR NOT ?

281
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,993
 No, I ain't
 found out.

282
00:14:21,092 --> 00:14:22,660
  I can move it.

283
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,163
IF YOU CAN MOVE IT,
IT'S NOT BROKE.

284
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:27,966
   It hurts.

285
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,935
IF YOU CAN MOVE IT,
IT'S NOT BROKE.

286
00:14:30,034 --> 00:14:33,038
IT'S GONNA HURT A WHILE 'CAUSE
YOU BRUISED IT PRETTY GOOD.

287
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:34,974
YOU JUST GOTTA LEARN
NOT TO HIT THEM WALLS

288
00:14:35,073 --> 00:14:37,942
HIT SOMEBODY ELSE.

289
00:14:38,842 --> 00:14:40,778
 There was nobody
 in my room to<i> hit.</i>

290
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:43,014
OH, OKAY.

291
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,682
  I didn't hit the wall,
  I hit the commode.

292
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,252
YOU "HIT THE COMMODE" ?

293
00:14:46,351 --> 00:14:47,919
  Yeah, I hit it
  on the side.

294
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:50,555
I didn't even
put a dent in it either.

295
00:14:50,655 --> 00:14:52,891
  That must be
 a hard commode.

296
00:14:52,991 --> 00:14:54,993
I HEARD THAT.

297
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,495
   What time is everyone
   gonna come up ?

298
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:57,763
I DON'T KNOW.

299
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:59,865
Y'all come up anytime,
'cause y'all be in here with me.

300
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:02,167
WELL, UH...

301
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:04,236
WE'LL SEE YOU SATURDAY.

302
00:15:26,256 --> 00:15:28,526
( man )
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO
GO THROUGH THE METAL DETECTOR

303
00:15:28,626 --> 00:15:30,495
WHEN YOU COME THROUGH
THE FRONT DOOR,

304
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,764
I WANT EVERYBODY
TO DO THAT,

305
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:35,433
THEY'VE GOT THAT PORTABLE THING
THEY CAN BRING FROM LITTLE ROCK

306
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:37,669
IF YOU NEED IT.

307
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:39,638
LIKE THE AIRPORT DEAL.

308
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:43,042
   WE COULDN'T AFFORD
   NO $3,000 METAL DETECTOR.

309
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,144
 WHAT I PLANNED ON DOIN'
 WAS USIN' TWO PORTABLES

310
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:46,812
  AT THIS DOOR,

311
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:49,949
THAT'S WHY I WANT EVERYBODY,
OUTSIDE OF LAWYERS,

312
00:15:50,048 --> 00:15:53,251
  AND I WANT THEM
  TO COME THROUGH THIS DOOR.

313
00:15:53,351 --> 00:15:56,020
THERE'S A POTENTIAL
OF A PROBLEM AREA

314
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,990
  WITH THE...

315
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,091
STRONG FEELINGS
OF THE FAMILY,

316
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:01,826
  AND THAT'S
  TO BE UNDERSTOOD

317
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,028
SO, SECURITY, NOT ONLY COMING
IN AND OUT OF THE COURTROOM

318
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,798
IS A PROBLEM,

319
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,933
BUT KEEPING THE ONLOOKERS
AND THE FAMILY

320
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:11,602
AND PEOPLE SEGREGATED

321
00:16:11,702 --> 00:16:14,105
FROM THE ACCUSED
IS ANOTHER PROBLEM

322
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:15,774
THAT YOU'LL HAVE, DARWIN.

323
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:17,909
MY INTENTION WAS
TO BRING THIS BOY IN

324
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:19,610
   BEFORE, LONG BEFORE COURT

325
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,447
  AND HAVE HIM IN SIGHT.

326
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:24,082
( man )
OBVIOUSLY I'M VERY CONCERNED
ABOUT SECURITY.

327
00:16:24,182 --> 00:16:25,750
SIMPLY BECAUSE OF
THE DEATH THREATS

328
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,187
THAT HAVE HAPPENED,

329
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,089
BUT I DON'T WANNA GIVE
THE JURY THE IMPRESSION,

330
00:16:30,188 --> 00:16:31,956
  IF WE HAVE
  20 STATE TROOPERS

331
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,959
  AND 50 COUNTY DEPUTIES,

332
00:16:34,058 --> 00:16:37,096
  IT'S GONNA GIVE
  THE IMPRESSION TO THE JURY

333
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,431
  THAT MY CLIENT IS
  A VERY DANGEROUS PERSON

334
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,500
  WHICH HE'S NOT,

335
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,869
  AND I DON'T WANT THE JURY
  TO GET THE WRONG IMPRESSION,

336
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,638
  I DON'T WANT THERE TO BE
  SUCH A CIRCUS IN THE COURTROOM

337
00:16:46,738 --> 00:16:48,841
  WITH REPORTERS AND CAMERAS

338
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,942
  THAT THE JURY FORGETS ABOUT
  WHAT THEY'RE HERE FOR

339
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,111
  AND THAT IS
  TO ADMINISTER JUSTICE.

340
00:16:53,977 --> 00:16:56,514
( man )
WE EXPECT THE PROOF'S
GOING TO SHOW

341
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,783
THAT THIS DEFENDANT CONFESSED,

342
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,818
THAT HE WAS NOT COERCED...

343
00:17:04,088 --> 00:17:06,258
WE DO NOT CONTEND THAT THE
PROOF'S GOING TO SHOW

344
00:17:06,357 --> 00:17:07,859
THAT EVERY WORD THAT
CAME OUT OF HIS MOUTH

345
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,627
WAS THE TRUTH.

346
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,897
( defense )
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
OF THE JURY

347
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:13,865
THIS STATEMENT THAT
MR. MISSKELLEY GAVE

348
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:15,700
THE WEST MEMPHIS
POLICE DEPARTMENT

349
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,903
IS A FALSE STORY,

350
00:17:18,002 --> 00:17:20,938
THE INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES
THAT WERE DEPLOYED AGAINST HIM

351
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:23,875
AT THE TIME OF HIS STATEMENT
ON JUNE THE 3RD

352
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,979
RENDERED HIM
COMPLETELY INCAPABLE...

353
00:17:28,546 --> 00:17:30,649
THEY BROKE HIS WILL,
THEY SCARED HIM

354
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,018
BEYOND ALL MEASURES.

355
00:17:33,117 --> 00:17:34,752
THE PROOF IS GOING TO SHOW

356
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,587
THAT THIS DEFENDANT

357
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,424
WAS AN ACCOMPLICE

358
00:17:38,523 --> 00:17:41,526
TO DAMIEN ECHOLS
AND JASON BALDWIN

359
00:17:41,626 --> 00:17:43,729
IN THE COMMISSION OF THESE

360
00:17:43,828 --> 00:17:46,097
HORRIFYING MURDERS

361
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,367
AND WE WILL ASK YOU

362
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:51,804
TO RETURN YOUR
VERDICT OF GUILTY

363
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:55,273
ON THREE COUNTS
OF CAPITAL MURDER.

364
00:17:57,909 --> 00:18:00,412
   ( woman )
   WE DON'T<i> KNOW</i>
   WHAT THE TRUTH IS

365
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:03,081
 BUT WHEN IT REALLY
 GETS DOWN TO IT...

366
00:18:05,182 --> 00:18:07,352
  HIS DADDY AND I ARE GONNA
  LOOK HIM SCARE IN THE EYES

367
00:18:07,451 --> 00:18:10,021
   AND SAY, SON,
   DID YOU DO THIS ?

368
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,257
WAS YOU EVEN THERE ?

369
00:18:13,223 --> 00:18:15,193
THAT'S WHEN
WE WILL BELIEVE.

370
00:18:16,094 --> 00:18:18,029
IF HE TOLD ME HE DID IT...

371
00:18:19,463 --> 00:18:21,466
WHICH I DON'T
BELIEVE HE DID,

372
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,801
BUT IF HE TOLD ME
HE DID IT...

373
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,737
HE'D HAVE TO DO HIS TIME.

374
00:18:25,836 --> 00:18:27,940
SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES.

375
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:29,740
   ( Lee )
   IF HE ADMITS TO THIS,

376
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,076
HE WOULD BE
STRICTLY ON HIS OWN.

377
00:18:32,844 --> 00:18:35,847
WE WOULDN'T EVEN SEND HIM A
DOLLAR FOR A PACK OF CIGARETTES.

378
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,682
NO, YOU'RE
WRONG THERE.

379
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:39,150
  YES, WE WOULD.

380
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,252
NO, I WOULD,
HE'S MY SON.

381
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,190
I'LL SEND HIM MONEY.

382
00:18:46,857 --> 00:18:49,193
BUT, HE WILL
HAVE TO DO HIS TIME.

383
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,998
  I WOULDN'T
  GIVE HIM A<i> NICKEL.</i>

384
00:18:53,097 --> 00:18:54,732
HE'S MY SON.

385
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:56,935
 WE CAN BE
 TALKIN' ABOUT--

386
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:59,605
   WE COULD BE
   TALKING ABOUT<i> MY</i> SON.

387
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:04,076
 IF MY SON DID SOMETHING
 THAT<i> HORRIBLE.</i>

388
00:19:04,741 --> 00:19:06,811
  NO, I WOULDN'T
  GIVE HIM A NICKEL.

389
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:07,813
  LET HIM SUFFER.

390
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,748
YOU CAN'T TURN
YOUR BLOOD AWAY.

391
00:19:09,847 --> 00:19:11,849
  I DON'T KNOW HOW
  YOU SAY YOU COULD,

392
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,719
AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE
A PROBLEM OVER THIS.

393
00:19:13,818 --> 00:19:15,553
BUT, I KNOW HOW IT IS
BEING UP THERE IN JAIL

394
00:19:15,653 --> 00:19:16,855
WITHOUT ANYTHING.

395
00:19:16,954 --> 00:19:18,456
   WELL, THAT'S
   BESIDE THE POINT,

396
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,858
  IF HE'S GUILTY

397
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,096
IF HE'S GUILTY OF DOING THIS
TO THESE LITTLE BOYS.

398
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:25,663
   NO.

399
00:19:25,763 --> 00:19:27,398
HE'S NOT.

400
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,468
 WELL I'M SAYING
 HE'S NOT<i> TOO.</i>

401
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:30,836
BUT,

402
00:19:30,935 --> 00:19:33,504
  IF HE HAPPENS TO--
  IF IT'S PROVEN.

403
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:36,974
  NO, FORGET IT, NO.

404
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,076
 NO.

405
00:19:39,176 --> 00:19:40,978
I DON'T BELIEVE
HE DID IT.

406
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,849
I'LL NEVER
BELIEVE HE DID IT.

407
00:19:49,953 --> 00:19:51,656
THIS IS TO JESSIE JR.

408
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,525
TODAY'S HIS 18TH BIRTHDAY.

409
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,693
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM

410
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,996
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
TO GO SEE HIM AT,

411
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:00,531
I'M GONNA SING
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY" TO HIM.

   ( laughs )

422
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:44,041
  ( woman )
  NOW, HE'S LEGAL
  TO GET 'EM, AIN'T HE ?

423
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,711
( Jessie Sr. )
YEAH, HE'S LEGAL
TO SMOKE NOW.

424
00:20:50,147 --> 00:20:52,683
  ( woman )
  I MAY NOT BE
  HIS BIOLOGICAL MOTHER

425
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,853
  BUT GIVING BIRTH
  DON'T MAKE A PARENT,

426
00:20:54,952 --> 00:20:58,089
  AND I'VE HAD HIM
  SINCE HE WAS FOUR...

427
00:20:58,823 --> 00:21:02,227
  AND IT TOOK ME
  ABOUT A YEAR

428
00:21:02,326 --> 00:21:04,895
TO ASSURE THAT LITTLE BOY
I WAS GONNA BE HERE FOR HIM,

429
00:21:04,996 --> 00:21:06,832
   HE WOULDN'T WANNA
   GO TO SCHOOL

430
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,268
 HE WOULDN'T
 GO OUTSIDE AND PLAY

431
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:11,869
   BECAUSE WAS AFRAID I WOULDN'T
   BE HERE WHEN HE CAME IN

432
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,007
 AND WHEN HE WAS IN KINDERGARTEN
 IF HE'D COME IN

433
00:21:15,106 --> 00:21:17,509
AND I HAPPENED NOT TO BE
WHERE HE CAN SEE ME

434
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:19,510
   WHEN HE FIRST COME IN

435
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,847
 HE WOULD BE HYSTERICAL
 WHEN I GOT TO HIM.

436
00:21:21,946 --> 00:21:22,713
AND...

437
00:21:23,413 --> 00:21:25,951
   I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT...

438
00:21:28,452 --> 00:21:30,021
HE WAS...

439
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,523
   HE HAD A PROBLEM.

440
00:21:33,124 --> 00:21:34,593
 AND I,

441
00:21:34,692 --> 00:21:37,095
 I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
 REAL PROTECTIVE OF HIM.

442
00:21:38,829 --> 00:21:40,898
MY MOM SENT ME THIS ONE.

443
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:45,170
  "THERE ARE
  ALL SORTS OF SONS

444
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:47,038
"SONS CAN BE SLOUCHY

445
00:21:47,138 --> 00:21:48,439
 "SONS CAN BE SWEET

446
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:50,642
 "SONS CAN BE GROUCHY...

447
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:53,512
  "SONS CAN BE NEAT

448
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:55,480
  "SONS CAN BE BROKE

449
00:21:55,579 --> 00:21:57,682
  "SONS CAN BE WELL-TO-DO...

450
00:21:57,782 --> 00:22:00,251
BUT NO SON COULD EVER BE
LOVED MORE THAN YOU."

451
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:01,987
   AND IT SAYS
   "HAPPY BIRTHDAY".

452
00:22:02,086 --> 00:22:04,388
( Jessie )
I CRY A LOT
WHEN I'M IN HERE

453
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,924
'CAUSE I MISS MY FAMILY
AND EVERYTHING.

454
00:22:07,724 --> 00:22:10,161
AND I JUST CRY A LOT.

455
00:22:10,261 --> 00:22:12,063
AFTER THAT, I GO TO BED,

456
00:22:12,163 --> 00:22:14,165
TRY TO SLEEP.

457
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:17,969
( woman )
MY NAME IS
ELLA SANDERS,

458
00:22:18,068 --> 00:22:20,004
MY SON WAS
ANTONIO SANDERS,

459
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:21,807
AND HE GOT KILLED,

460
00:22:21,906 --> 00:22:24,208
HALLOWEEN NIGHT, 1990.

461
00:22:24,308 --> 00:22:25,844
( woman )
MY NAME IS BRENDA McCLAINE

462
00:22:25,943 --> 00:22:27,778
AND MY BROTHER
WAS STABBED TO DEATH.

463
00:22:27,878 --> 00:22:29,714
( woman )
I'M BRENDA EAST

464
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:32,918
AND MY SON, ROBERT,
23 AT THE TIME

465
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,220
WAS MURDERED
IN 1990.

466
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,922
MY NAME'S ANNE WALLEN

467
00:22:37,021 --> 00:22:38,823
MY DAUGHTER WAS
SHEILA DIXON

468
00:22:38,923 --> 00:22:41,826
SHE WAS MURDERED
JANUARY THE 12TH OF '91.

469
00:22:48,332 --> 00:22:50,235
I'M WANDA RANY.

470
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:53,872
MY DAUGHTER WAS MURDERED,

471
00:22:53,971 --> 00:22:55,440
JUNE THE 27TH,

472
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:57,742
WE THINK,
WE'RE NOT SURE,

473
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:00,045
THEY'RE CALLING IT
A CRIME OF PASSION,

474
00:23:00,144 --> 00:23:02,381
THEY NOT ONLY
THROWED HER OUT

475
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,250
AND LET HER LAY
TWO WEEKS,

476
00:23:05,349 --> 00:23:06,584
HE POURED ACID ON HER

477
00:23:06,684 --> 00:23:08,753
TO DETERIORATE HER BODY.

478
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,094
I DIDN'T
HAVE THE PLEASURE...

479
00:23:17,828 --> 00:23:20,197
OF TELLING
MY DAUGHTER GOOD-BYE.

480
00:23:21,097 --> 00:23:22,901
FUNERAL WAS
CLOSED CASKET...

481
00:23:24,268 --> 00:23:26,238
AND THIS IS WHAT
I HAD ON THE CASKET.

482
00:23:27,438 --> 00:23:29,975
AND IT'S STILL
VERY UNREAL TO ME.

483
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:34,011
WHEN THE TELEPHONE RINGS
I EXPECT IT TO BE HER.

484
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:35,980
MY NAME'S TODD MOORE.

485
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,115
MY SON WAS MARK MOORE,

486
00:23:38,215 --> 00:23:39,917
HE WAS MURDERED ALONG WITH

487
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:42,354
CHRISTOPHER BYERS
AND STEVEN BRANCH

488
00:23:42,453 --> 00:23:44,755
MAY 5TH, 1993.

489
00:23:51,028 --> 00:23:52,831
I CANNOT
DESCRIBE THE PAIN...

490
00:23:55,432 --> 00:23:57,501
THAT MY FAMILY
HAS WENT THROUGH

491
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,604
THEY DIDN'T
JUST KILL MY SON

492
00:23:59,703 --> 00:24:01,572
THEY KILLED PART OF ME.

493
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:03,741
THEY KILLED A PART
OF MY WIFE,

494
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:05,243
HER DAUGHTER.

495
00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:09,681
I'M SO FRUSTRATED

496
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,682
   BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE
   THEY HAVE SO MUCH RIGHTS,

497
00:24:11,782 --> 00:24:13,551
  WE HAVE NO RIGHTS,

498
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:15,586
   THEY HAD IN THE PAPER
   THE OTHER DAY,

499
00:24:15,686 --> 00:24:17,555
   NOW THE TAXPAYERS
   IN GRITON COUNTY

500
00:24:17,655 --> 00:24:19,457
   ARE GONNA HAVE TO
   BUY THEM A SUIT

501
00:24:19,557 --> 00:24:21,460
 BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT
 THEM TO GO INTO COURT

502
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:23,627
   LOOKING LIKE
   WHAT THEY ARE, CRIMINALS.

503
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:25,464
  THEY'RE IN JAIL,
  THEY SHOULD WEAR JAIL CLOTHES.

504
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:27,566
   WHY DO THEY NEED TO HAVE

505
00:24:27,665 --> 00:24:29,467
   A NICE SUIT
   BOUGHT BY THE COUNTY

506
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:31,368
   SO THEY
   LOOK PRESENTABLE ?

507
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,605
 THEY DON'T WANT 'EM
 IN SHACKLES AND CHAINS.

508
00:24:33,704 --> 00:24:35,840
 YOU KNOW, THESE ARE NOT
 BOYS THAT MURDERED

509
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,675
 OUR KIDS.

510
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:39,577
THEY STOPPED BEING BOYS

511
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,913
WHEN THEY PLANNED THIS,

512
00:24:42,012 --> 00:24:43,948
 AND I SIT THERE
 AND WATCH THEIR PARENTS

513
00:24:44,048 --> 00:24:45,817
COMIN' OUT OF COURTS, CRYING

514
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:47,785
 TALKIN' ABOUT
 THEIR SON'S RIGHTS.

515
00:24:47,885 --> 00:24:49,553
  WHAT ABOUT
 <i> OUR</i> SON'S RIGHTS ?

516
00:24:49,653 --> 00:24:51,556
   WHERE THE HELL WAS HIS RIGHTS
   OUT ON THAT DITCH BANK ?

517
00:24:51,655 --> 00:24:53,390
  HE HAD NO RIGHTS,

518
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,759
   HE HAD THE RIGHTS
   TO BE BRUTALLY MURDERED ?

519
00:24:55,859 --> 00:24:58,762
  TO BE BEAT TO DEATH,
  AN 8-YEAR-OLD LITTLE BOY ?

520
00:24:58,863 --> 00:25:00,632
  WHERE WAS HIS RIGHTS ?

521
00:25:00,731 --> 00:25:03,835
( woman )
I'M DIANE MOORE,
MICHAEL MOORE'S MOTHER,

522
00:25:03,934 --> 00:25:05,803
LAST WEEK IN
FLASH MARKET,

523
00:25:05,903 --> 00:25:09,340
THE ECHOL'S MAN WAS IN THERE
STARING ME DOWN.

524
00:25:09,707 --> 00:25:11,943
LIKE IT WAS MY FAULT
THAT I HAD A CHILD

525
00:25:12,042 --> 00:25:14,211
THAT HIS CHILD
COULD MURDER.

526
00:25:15,645 --> 00:25:17,749
WE SEEN

527
00:25:17,848 --> 00:25:20,985
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE
SUPPORTING THESE PEOPLE,

528
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,487
THAT LOOK AT US

529
00:25:22,586 --> 00:25:24,522
LIKE WE'RE SCUM,

530
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:26,857
AND THESE OTHER PEOPLE
ARE JUST...

531
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:28,894
THE GREATEST THING
THAT THEY'VE EVER KNOWN,

532
00:25:28,993 --> 00:25:30,461
NOW THEY WANNA

533
00:25:30,561 --> 00:25:32,630
HAVE 'EM ALL
JUST DRESSED UP

534
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,733
AND ACT LIKE
LITTLE CHOIR BOYS IN COURT.

535
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:38,570
HERE YOU GO, HE DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING WRONG.

536
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,406
MY SON DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG,
HE'S JUST A BOY.

537
00:25:42,906 --> 00:25:44,742
( man )
NOW, ON JUNE THE 3RD

538
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:47,679
DID YOU HAVE AN ASSIGNMENT
TO LOCATE A PARTICULAR PERSON ?

539
00:25:47,778 --> 00:25:50,682
MY ASSIGNMENT WAS TO CONTACT

540
00:25:50,781 --> 00:25:53,150
JESSIE MISKELLEY JR.

541
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,720
   AT THAT TIME WAS
   THE DEFENDANT A SUSPECT ?

542
00:25:55,819 --> 00:25:56,855
( Allen )
NO, SIR.

543
00:25:56,954 --> 00:25:58,789
 ( prosecutor )
 IF HE WAS NOT A SUSPECT

544
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,026
   WHY WERE YOU ASSIGNED
   TO CONTACT HIM ?

545
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:03,961
  HE WAS A FRIEND WITH--

546
00:26:04,061 --> 00:26:06,497
  FRIENDS WITH DAMIEN ECHOLS

547
00:26:06,597 --> 00:26:09,166
  AND JASON BALDWIN.

548
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,703
  WHAT, IF ANYTHING,
  DID HE TELL YOU...

549
00:26:14,538 --> 00:26:17,342
 DURING THIS CONVERSATION
 BEFORE THE TAPE RECORDING ?

550
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:20,178
HE TOLD US
THAT HE HAD ATTENDED

551
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:23,014
SOME SATANIC
CULT-TYPE MEETINGS,

552
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:24,982
THAT BOYS,

553
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,652
ALONG WITH GIRLS
WOULD ATTEND,

554
00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:29,486
THERE WOULD BE

555
00:26:29,586 --> 00:26:31,655
SESSIONS OF SEX,

556
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,059
ORGIES,
AS HE CALLED THEM.

557
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:36,827
UH, THAT...

558
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,697
DOGS AND ANIMALS

559
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:40,798
HAD BEEN KILLED

560
00:26:40,898 --> 00:26:42,933
AND IN FACT
THOSE ANIMALS,

561
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:43,835
PORTIONS OF THEM,

562
00:26:43,934 --> 00:26:45,971
HAVE BEEN
EATEN BY THE MEMBERS.

563
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:50,342
( Mark Byers )
I BELIEVE THERE'S
ANGELS ON EARTH,

564
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,876
 I BELIEVE THERE'S<i>
 DEMONS</i> ON EARTH.

565
00:26:52,977 --> 00:26:55,447
AND I BELIEVE AS ANGELS
TRY TO HELP PEOPLE,

566
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:59,084
I BELIEVE DEMONS TRY TO
POSSESS AND HURT PEOPLE

567
00:26:59,183 --> 00:27:01,251
TO DO THE DEVIL'S WILL.

568
00:27:01,352 --> 00:27:03,455
JUST HOW ANGELS
TRY TO HELP PEOPLE

569
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,624

THERE'S NO DOUBT

608
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:12,717
THAT ABOUT 5:30 P.M.
JESSIE WAS SITTIN'--

609
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:14,719
HE WAS SITTIN'
RIGHT DOWN HERE.

610
00:29:14,818 --> 00:29:16,653
   I HAD SEEN THE POLICE
   OVER THERE TWICE.

611
00:29:16,753 --> 00:29:18,722
 I'D ALSO SEEN
LITTLE JESSIE OVER THERE

612
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:20,792
  AND THEY
  TALKED TO HIM.

613
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:21,893
POLICE OFFICERS
TALKED TO HIM.

614
00:29:21,992 --> 00:29:22,961
   YES, SIR.

615
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,230
THEY HAD TO FIND SOMEBODY
TO PIN THIS ON.

616
00:29:26,596 --> 00:29:28,700
THIS PUBLICITY
WAS GETTING OUT OF HAND.

617
00:29:31,067 --> 00:29:33,872
 ( man )
 CAN YOU ASK THOSE FOLKS INSIDE
 TO STEP OUT FOR JUST A SECOND ?

618
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:38,675
 I KNOW THAT
 I'VE TALKED TO EACH OF YOU,

619
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:40,979
IF NOT DIRECTLY,
INDIRECTLY,

620
00:29:41,078 --> 00:29:42,513
  WE NEED TO BE
  VERY, VERY CAREFUL

621
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,582
ABOUT WHO WE TALK TO

622
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:47,218
WITH REGARD TO THE MEDIA
INVOLVED IN THIS CASE.

623
00:29:47,317 --> 00:29:49,753
 THERE ARE SEVERAL MEMBERS
 OF THE MEDIA WHO APPARENTLY

624
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,523
 HAVE NO ETHICS

625
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,725
   AND HAVE DECIDED THAT THEY'RE
   GONNA DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN

626
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:55,559
  TO DIG UP MUD
  AND SLING MUD,

627
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,595
  IT'S NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING
  BUT HURT JESSIE

628
00:29:57,694 --> 00:29:59,596
 AND HIS CHANCES OF
 RECEIVING A FAIR TRIAL.

629
00:29:59,696 --> 00:30:02,500
   YOU, AS FRIENDS OF JESSIE
   AND RELATIVES OF JESSIE,

630
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:05,035
 ARE PRIME TARGETS FOR
 THESE MEMBERS OF THE PRESS.

631
00:30:05,135 --> 00:30:07,838
 AND IF WE JUST REMEMBER
 THE ONE RULE IS

632
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:10,141
  DON'T TALK TO ANYBODY, THEN WE
  WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT.

633
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,875
  DOES THAT MAKE SENSE ?

634
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,679
  SO, AGAIN I CAUTION YOU NOT TO
  TALK TO ANYBODY IN THE PRESS,

635
00:30:14,778 --> 00:30:17,615
  IT'S JUST
  GONNA HURT US, THANKS.

ONE THING I LIKE
ABOUT THIS RIGHT HERE,

645
00:30:57,888 --> 00:30:59,857
BLACK POWDER GUN,

646
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:03,194
IS THEY CAN'T PULL ANY TYPE
OF BALLISTICS ON IT,

647
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:05,930
IF BY SOME CHANCE YOU WAS
TO SHOOT SOMETHING WITH IT,

648
00:31:06,029 --> 00:31:07,932
EVERY BULLET RIFLES
THROUGH THE CHAMBER

649
00:31:08,031 --> 00:31:09,833
JUST A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.

650
00:31:11,501 --> 00:31:14,638
SO, THEY JUST CAN'T PULL
NO BALLISTICS OFF THIS ONE.

651
00:31:15,471 --> 00:31:18,876
THERE'S A FEW PEOPLE I WOULDN'T
MIND SHOOTING WITH IT.

652
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:21,412
BUT, HOPEFULLY THE COURTS
AND THE JUSTICE SYSTEM'S

653
00:31:21,511 --> 00:31:23,681
GONNA TAKE CARE OF 'EM.

654
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,317
IF THEY REACH PRISON,
THEY'LL GET TOOK CARE OF.

655
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:30,588
( Mark )
TODD, I COULD SAVE THE STATE
A LOT OF MONEY.

656
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:33,791
IF THEY JUST LET ME LINE
THEM THREE SONOFAGUNS UP,

657
00:31:33,891 --> 00:31:35,860
I'D SAY THIS ONE HERE
IS FOR YOU JESSIE,

658
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,462
AND WE'RE GONNA GO
FOR THE JUG OF WATER.

659
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,632
OH, JESSIE, I DONE BLOWED YOU
HALF IN TWO, SON !

660
00:31:44,701 --> 00:31:46,471
THIS ONE HERE'S
FOR YOU, DAMIEN,

661
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:49,006
YOU THAT BLACK CIRCLE
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE.

662
00:31:49,106 --> 00:31:50,841
OH, YOU GOT HURT.

663
00:31:51,642 --> 00:31:54,144
( Todd )
DAMN, THAT SURE LOOKED
PAINFUL, DIDN'T IT ?

664
00:31:54,244 --> 00:31:55,712
 HEY, JASON ?

665
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:58,716
I WANT YOU TO SMILE AND
BLOW ME A KISS FOR THIS ONE.

666
00:32:00,317 --> 00:32:02,287
LET'S GO BACK
TO JESSIE.

667
00:32:02,386 --> 00:32:03,820
I JUST WOUNDED HIM,

668
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:06,857
I WANT HIM TO BLEED A LITTLE BIT
LIKE HE MADE MY BABY BLEED.

669
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,960
OH, JESSIE...

670
00:32:09,692 --> 00:32:13,030
THAT BREAKS MY HEART
THINKIN' ABOUT THAT SCUM.

671
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:15,500
'CAUSE THIS RIGHT HERE'S ALL
THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO HIM,

672
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:17,501
SHOT SLOWLY,

673
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,171
WITH A REAL NICE FIREARM.

674
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,039
AND IT AIN'T GOT
NO CONSIDERATION

675
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,975
OR NO FEELING
WHO IT'S AIMIN' AT,

676
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,678
JUST LIKE THEY DIDN'T
CARE ABOUT KILLING MY BABY.

677
00:32:28,945 --> 00:32:31,148
   I'D BE HAPPY WITH
   LINING THEM UP.

678
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:33,284
 I WOULDN'T HAVE
 NO PROBLEM WITH IT.

679
00:32:35,318 --> 00:32:38,221
 I THINK OLD JESSIE'S
 STILL KICKIN' A LITTLE.

680
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:41,092
  PUT HIM OUT OF HIS MISERY.

681
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:44,028
WHAT KIND OF RANGE
DO WE GOT IN THE COURTROOM ?

682
00:32:44,127 --> 00:32:46,129
 PROBABLY ABOUT
 10 FOOT RIGHT HERE.

683
00:32:47,564 --> 00:32:49,933
 GO AHEAD AND
 WASTE OLD JESSIE.

684
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:52,270
I DON'T SEE THAT BEIN'
MUCH OF A PROBLEM.

685
00:32:52,369 --> 00:32:55,105
NO, BECAUSE
I CAN JUST SEE THE SCUM.

686
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,842
THAT'S GOOD.

687
00:32:57,942 --> 00:32:59,609
GO AHEAD,
HE'S WIGGLING,

688
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,078
ALRIGHT,

689
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,913
I COULD LIVE WITH THAT.

690
00:33:08,818 --> 00:33:12,123
  ( prosecution )
  DURING THE COURSE
  OF THESE CONVERSATIONS

691
00:33:12,222 --> 00:33:15,192
WAS ANYTHING
SHOWN TO THE DEFENDANT ?

692
00:33:15,292 --> 00:33:16,560
 YES, SIR.

693
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,528
   ALRIGHT, WHAT WAS
   SHOWN TO HIM ?

694
00:33:18,628 --> 00:33:20,697
   THERE WAS A PICTURE THAT
   INSP. GITCHELL SHOWED HIM.

695
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:23,233
 AND WHAT WAS
 THAT A PICTURE OF ?

696
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,236
( man )
ONE OF THE VICTIMS.

697
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:29,007
WHEN I SHOWED JESSIE
THIS PHOTOGRAPH,

698
00:33:29,106 --> 00:33:30,741
HE TOOK IT INTO HIS HAND

699
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,778
AND HE JUST WENT BACK
IN HIS CHAIR LIKE THIS,

700
00:33:33,877 --> 00:33:35,946
AND HE JUST LOCKED IN ON IT,

701
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:37,682
FIXED IN
ON THE PHOTOGRAPH,

702
00:33:37,781 --> 00:33:39,583
AND JUST KEPT STARING AT IT
AND STARING AT IT.

703
00:33:39,683 --> 00:33:42,420
   INITIALLY, MR. MISSKELLEY

704
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:44,922
 DENIED ANY INVOLVEMENT
 WHATSOEVER IN THIS, DIDN'T HE ?

705
00:33:45,021 --> 00:33:46,390
 YES, SIR, HE DID.

706
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,526
  OFFICER RIDGE,

707
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:51,528
THE PHOTOGRAPH THAT WAS JUST
INTRODUCED INTO EVIDENCE,

708
00:33:51,628 --> 00:33:53,397
   DEPICTING ONE OF
   THE BOY'S BODIES,

709
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:55,365
  THAT WAS SHOWN TO JESSIE ?

710
00:33:55,465 --> 00:33:56,800
  YES.

711
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:58,736
   AND THIS WAS
   IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO HIM

712
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:00,404
  ADMITTING AND
  TELLING YOU THIS STORY

713
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:02,507
 ABOUT BEING PRESENT
 WHEN THE BOYS WERE KILLED ?

714
00:34:02,606 --> 00:34:04,608
 SHORTLY BEFORE,
 YES, SIR.

715
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,677
  WHY DID YOU GUYS DO THAT ?

716
00:34:06,777 --> 00:34:09,579
THERE HAD TO BE
A REASON TO DO THAT.

717
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,616
 ( Ridge )
 THERE WERE TIMES WHEN JESSIE
 WOULD NOT BE TALKING,

718
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,919
 HE'S GETTING SLOWER
 WITH INFORMATION,

719
00:34:15,018 --> 00:34:17,054
 HE'S TELLING US THINGS,

720
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:18,923
 IT'S OVER AND OVER,
 THE SAME THING.

721
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:20,658
 THOSE TECHNIQUES ARE USED

722
00:34:20,757 --> 00:34:22,526
 TO EVOKE A RESPONSE.

723
00:34:24,193 --> 00:34:26,197
( defense )
YOU AND INSP. GITCHELL
DID THESE THINGS

724
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:28,199
   TO EVOKE A RESPONSE.

725
00:34:28,298 --> 00:34:29,467
YES, SIR.

726
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,436
   TO EVOKE CONFESSION.

727
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:33,804
EVOKE A RESPONSE,
KEEP HIM TALKING.

728
00:34:35,005 --> 00:34:36,840
DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU

729
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,409
 THAT MR. MISSKELLEY
 HAS A MENTAL HANDICAP ?

730
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,512
NO, SIR, IT DIDN'T TO ME
ON THAT DATE.

731
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,648
DID YOU HAVE
ANY SPECIAL TRAINING

732
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,615
 DEALING WITH PEOPLE
 WITH MENTAL HANDICAPS ?

733
00:34:45,715 --> 00:34:47,818
( Ridge )
NO, SIR.

734
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:49,953
 ( defense )
 DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU
 THAT THIS WAS GONNA SCARE HIM,

735
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:51,989
 SHOWING HIM A
 PICTURE OF A BODY ?

736
00:34:53,222 --> 00:34:54,791
THAT IT WOULD SCARE HIM ?

737
00:34:55,324 --> 00:34:57,260
I DON'T KNOW,
I GUESS HE'S SCARED

738
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,230
INTO MAKING A STATEMENT,
YES, SIR.

739
00:35:00,864 --> 00:35:03,067
 ( Jessie )
 I'm getting nervous
 every day.

740
00:35:03,166 --> 00:35:04,235
 WHY ?

741
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:05,269
 Why ?!

742
00:35:06,269 --> 00:35:07,704
OH, OKAY.

743
00:35:07,804 --> 00:35:09,673
   That's a stupid question.

744
00:35:09,773 --> 00:35:11,775
( Susie )
OKAY.

745
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:13,611
I can barely
hold this phone.

746
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:17,147
  It's getting
  closer and closer.

747
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:19,784
I don't wanna
even think about it.

748
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:22,052
 I can imagine what
 they're gonna do to me.

749
00:35:22,152 --> 00:35:23,721
  I can imagine.

750
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,523
  But, I'm not gonna
  think that though.

751
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:29,059
( Susie )
THINK GOOD THOUGHTS,
WHILE I'M ON THE PHONE.

752
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:31,828
TALK ABOUT SOMETHING GOOD
WHILE I'M ON THE PHONE.

753
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:33,798
HEY, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
TALKING TO ME,

754
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:36,033
NOT YOUR FRIENDS.

755
00:35:36,132 --> 00:35:38,902
These people
make me mad.

756
00:35:39,003 --> 00:35:40,238
   You know it ?

757
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:42,140
UH-HUH.

758
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:44,942
   They get to go out and
   screw people and I can't.

759
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:50,514
   That's what y'all do,
   I can't do that.

760
00:35:50,614 --> 00:35:52,415
WELL, YOU WILL LATER.

761
00:35:52,516 --> 00:35:55,253
   I will later ?
   How do you know ?

762
00:35:56,186 --> 00:35:58,722
   I mean if I can
   get out, we will.

763
00:35:58,822 --> 00:36:00,991
 If I don't get out,
 we won't.

764
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:02,793
What I was gonna
ask you that Sunday,

765
00:36:02,893 --> 00:36:05,396
   That I dreamed about you.

766
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,932
You wouldn't believe
what I was dreaming.

767
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:10,134
  It freaked me out.

768
00:36:10,233 --> 00:36:11,735
 Wanna hear it ?

769
00:36:11,835 --> 00:36:12,802
   Huh ?

770
00:36:12,902 --> 00:36:14,638
( Susie )
YEAH.

771
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:17,507
  We was having sex,
  alright ?

772
00:36:19,009 --> 00:36:19,911
O.K.

773
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,846
We went to the bathroom,
we had sex.

774
00:36:21,945 --> 00:36:23,914
When I was going out
the front door

775
00:36:24,014 --> 00:36:26,416
 We had sex right there.

776
00:36:26,516 --> 00:36:28,518
We done it
out in the yard,

777
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:30,954
 In front of everybody.

778
00:36:31,054 --> 00:36:32,757
 It freaked me out !

779
00:36:33,856 --> 00:36:36,494
 I woke up,
 I was sweatin' bad.

780
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:39,429
I said I hope that dream
come true quick.

781
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,233
What are you gonna do
when you get off the phone ?

782
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,701
SNEAK BACK HOME.

783
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,101
  Go back home ?

784
00:36:45,202 --> 00:36:47,205
 I'm gonna go back home too,
 when I get off the phone.

785
00:36:47,304 --> 00:36:49,039
I WISH YOU COULD.

786
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:50,740
I WISH YOU COULD.

787
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,043
   Yeah.

788
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:54,144
  Well, my time's up, okay ?

789
00:36:54,244 --> 00:36:55,913
  I gotta go, okay ?

790
00:36:56,012 --> 00:36:56,846
 I love you.

791
00:36:56,947 --> 00:36:57,748
I LOVE YOU TOO.

792
00:36:57,847 --> 00:36:58,782
Bye-bye.

793
00:36:58,882 --> 00:36:59,983
  ( hangs up phone )

794
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:26,844
CAN YOU GET
IT IN THERE ?

795
00:37:26,943 --> 00:37:28,012
YEAH.

796
00:37:53,869 --> 00:37:55,940
   I THINK THOSE TWO
   OUGHTA DO FINE.

797
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:57,875
YEAH, I'M SURE
THEY WILL BE.

798
00:37:59,943 --> 00:38:01,612
YEAH, THIS ONE'S GOOD.

799
00:38:01,711 --> 00:38:03,179
THIS ONE CAME OUT.

800
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:03,748
 O.K.

801
00:38:07,751 --> 00:38:09,954
( Mark )
BIG DIFFERENCE FROM
ANY OTHER CHRISTMAS.

802
00:38:12,422 --> 00:38:15,059
  ( Mark )
  ONE I'LL NEVER FORGET.

803
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:18,496
( Melissa )
IT'S THE FIRST ONE
WITHOUT HIM.

804
00:38:30,072 --> 00:38:32,809
I WISH YOU COULD'VE
BEEN HERE TO HEAR ME SING.

805
00:38:32,909 --> 00:38:35,211
HE LIKED TO HEAR ME SING.

806
00:38:46,255 --> 00:38:48,759
THIS LITTLE CHRISTMAS TREE
WILL STAY THERE REAL WELL,

807
00:38:48,858 --> 00:38:50,894
IT'S IN THERE
TIGHT ENOUGH,

808
00:38:50,994 --> 00:38:53,596
I DON'T THINK THE WIND WILL
BLOW IT OVER OR ANYTHING.

809
00:38:53,697 --> 00:38:56,032
   C'MERE AND
   KNEEL DOWN HERE BY ME.

810
00:39:08,644 --> 00:39:11,614
   OH, GOD, WHY DID
   YOU LET THIS HAPPEN ?

811
00:39:12,581 --> 00:39:14,984
  PLEASE HELP US
  THROUGH IT.

812
00:39:18,054 --> 00:39:20,523
   GOD, PLEASE
   HELP US THROUGH THIS.

813
00:39:24,693 --> 00:39:28,099
( man )
THIS IS AN ENLARGED PHOTOGRAPH
OF THE CRIME SCENE,

814
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,834
THIS IS THE DITCH

815
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:31,902
WHERE THE BODIES
WERE FOUND,

816
00:39:32,001 --> 00:39:34,838
MICHAEL MOORE WAS FOUND
IN THIS AREA AT THE BOTTOM,

817
00:39:34,938 --> 00:39:37,875
STEVE BRANCH WAS FOUND

818
00:39:37,974 --> 00:39:39,442
JUST BEHIND

819
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,746
WHERE THESE TREES ARE
IN THE STREAM,

820
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:43,780
AND CHRISTOPHER BYERS
WAS FOUND JUST BELOW,

821
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,782
THAT BODY RIGHT HERE.

822
00:39:45,882 --> 00:39:47,751
THIS IS EXHIBIT 22,

823
00:39:47,851 --> 00:39:50,954
WHICH IS THE BODY
OF MICHAEL MOORE,

824
00:39:51,054 --> 00:39:53,890
AFTER REMOVING HIM
FROM THE WATER.

825
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,025
THE WAY HE WAS FOUND.

826
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:02,333
THIS IS THE BODY
OF STEVE BRANCH,

827
00:40:02,432 --> 00:40:04,969
STEVE BRANCH
IS THE ONE THAT HAD

828
00:40:05,068 --> 00:40:07,637
THE INJURES TO HIS FACE.

829
00:40:07,737 --> 00:40:09,940
 ( prosecutor )
 WAS IT A PARTICULAR
 PART OF HIS FACE ?

830
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:12,076
( man )
THE LEFT SIDE.

831
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:19,617
THIS IS STATE EXHIBIT 24,

832
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:22,186
THE BODY OF
CHRISTOPHER BYERS.

833
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:24,922
  ( prosecutor )
  WHAT KIND OF INJURES
  DID CHRIS BYERS HAVE,

834
00:40:25,021 --> 00:40:26,923
   DID YOU OBSERVE ?

835
00:40:27,023 --> 00:40:29,426
IT LOOKED AS THOUGH
HIS PENIS HAD BEEN REMOVED.

836
00:40:31,961 --> 00:40:32,996
( sobs )

837
00:40:45,307 --> 00:40:48,012
COULD YOU SEE THE PICTURES
FROM WHERE YOU WERE SITTING ?

838
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,914
YEAH, THAT'S WHY
I HAD TO LEAVE.

839
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:51,481
   WHY ?

840
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:53,616
  BECAUSE I ALWAYS--

841
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:55,985
SEEING MY
BOY THE WAY HE WAS,

842
00:40:56,085 --> 00:40:58,988
   I'LL ALWAYS HAVE THAT PICTURE
   OF WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE,

843
00:40:59,088 --> 00:41:01,257
 IN MY MIND.

844
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,260
BUT, YOU NEVER
KNEW UNTIL NOW.

845
00:41:04,327 --> 00:41:06,464
 YOU SAID EARLY ON

846
00:41:06,563 --> 00:41:08,798
 YOU REALLY
 DIDN'T WANNA KNOW.

847
00:41:08,898 --> 00:41:10,867
 BUT, NOW YOU'RE HEARING IT,

848
00:41:10,967 --> 00:41:13,703
IS IT A LOT HARDER THAN WHAT
YOU THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE ?

849
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:16,240
 IT'S A WHOLE LOT HARDER
 THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

850
00:41:18,108 --> 00:41:20,244
  IT LIKE GOING BACK
  TO MAY 5TH

851
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:22,480
  AND RELIVING
  IT ALL OVER AGAIN.

852
00:42:53,969 --> 00:42:56,406
   ( defense )
   INSPECTOR, LET'S
   TALK ABOUT THE THINGS

853
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:59,742
  THAT JESSIE TOLD YOU THAT
  ARE JUST ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT,

854
00:42:59,842 --> 00:43:01,844
   ON PAGE 9
   OF HIS STATEMENT,

855
00:43:01,945 --> 00:43:04,114
JESSIE SAYS THAT

856
00:43:04,213 --> 00:43:06,583
 THE MURDERS
 TOOK PLACE AROUND NOON,

857
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:08,452
HOW DID YOU KNOW
THAT WAS INCORRECT ?

858
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:12,056
  BECAUSE THE YOUNG BOYS
  WERE STILL IN SCHOOL.

859
00:43:12,155 --> 00:43:14,424
 DID AT ANY TIME WHEN HE WAS
 TELLING YOU THESE THINGS

860
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:16,793
THAT YOU KNEW
WERE INCORRECT,

861
00:43:16,893 --> 00:43:19,062
DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU
THAT WHAT HE WAS TELLIN' YOU

862
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:20,664
   WAS FALSE ?

863
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,066
   HIS ENTIRE STORY
   WAS FALSE ?

864
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:23,767
IN JESSIE'S CASE,

865
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:26,470
I FEEL HE DID TELL US
A GOOD BIT OF THE TRUTH

866
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,773
BUT THEN THEY ALSO LESSENED
THEIR ACTIVITY IN A STATEMENT,

867
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:32,175
THAT'S JUST COMMON,

868
00:43:32,275 --> 00:43:33,978
AT LEAST IN MY
20 YEARS CAREER.

869
00:43:34,077 --> 00:43:36,213
 IS IT COMMON FOR THE POLICE
 TO SIMPLY IGNORE

870
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:38,548
  THESE BIG OBVIOUS PROBLEMS
  AND JUST ASSUME,

871
00:43:38,648 --> 00:43:42,251
THAT EVERYTHING HE'S TELLING YOU
HAS GOTTA BE CORRECT ?

872
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:45,155
JESSIE SIMPLY
GOT CONFUSED.

873
00:43:48,324 --> 00:43:49,927
   ( defense )
   YOU AND I
   CAN TELL THE COPS

874
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:51,894
THAT WE KNOW
WHAT OUR RIGHTS ARE,

875
00:43:51,994 --> 00:43:54,063
   BASICALLY GO TO HELL,

876
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:56,000
 WE'RE NOT GONNA
 TAKE THIS AND WALK OUT.

877
00:43:56,099 --> 00:43:57,735
  JESSIE MISSKELLEY
  HAS NO CONCEPT

878
00:43:57,835 --> 00:43:59,737
 OF BEING ABLE TO
 LEAVE A POLICE STATION,

879
00:43:59,836 --> 00:44:01,771
THE ONLY THING
THAT THE PROSECUTION

880
00:44:01,871 --> 00:44:03,873
  HAS PUT ON
  AGAINST JESSIE

881
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:06,644
IS THIS WILD STORY
THAT HE TOLD THE POLICE,

882
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:09,579
AND I HOPE THE FACT THAT
THERE'S NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE

883
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:11,748
  LINKING HIM
  TO THE CRIME SCENE

884
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:13,784
  IS GONNA HAVE A LOT
  OF IMPACT ON THE JURY,

885
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:16,186
 WE'RE TALKIN' ABOUT
 REASONABLE DOUBT.

886
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:18,554
I THINK YOU NEED TO DEAL WITH
LACK OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE,

887
00:44:18,655 --> 00:44:21,125
NOT JUST TO LET THEM
GET AWAY WITH THE FACT

888
00:44:21,224 --> 00:44:23,726
THAT THEY WERE IN THE WATER
AND IT ALL WASHED AWAY.

889
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,763
A CRIME SCENE THAT CLEAN

890
00:44:25,862 --> 00:44:29,165
HAS TO BE PURPOSELY PLANNED,
DONE THAT WAY.

891
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:31,434
THE FACT THEY
LOOKED WASHED DOWN

892
00:44:31,534 --> 00:44:33,770
WAS NOT JUST
HAPPENSTANCE...

893
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:39,043
SOMEBODY INTENTIONALLY...

894
00:44:40,143 --> 00:44:41,311
PURPOSEFULLY...

895
00:44:42,545 --> 00:44:44,914
WITH GREAT CUNNING
AND INTELLIGENCE

896
00:44:45,014 --> 00:44:48,284
TRIED TO GET RID OF...

897
00:44:49,918 --> 00:44:52,556
EVERY SPOT OF BLOOD, SEMEN,

898
00:44:52,655 --> 00:44:54,625
MUD, FOOTPRINT,

899
00:44:54,724 --> 00:44:56,860
ANYTHING THAT
MAY HAVE BEEN THERE,

900
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,561
THEY PURPOSEFULLY
TRIED TO GET RID OF ALL THAT.

901
00:44:58,661 --> 00:45:01,364
AN 18, 17,
AND A 16-YR-OLD KID,

902
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:04,201
DON'T PULL THAT OFF.

903
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,503
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF
PROFESSIONAL KILLERS

904
00:45:06,603 --> 00:45:08,505
  WHO DON'T LEAVE IT
  THIS CLEAN.

905
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:10,974
( Wilkins )
I REALLY DO BELIEVE
THAT IF THE JURY

906
00:45:11,074 --> 00:45:13,644
HEARS WHAT
SERIAL KILLERS ARE LIKE,

907
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:16,547
AND WHAT THEY DO
AND HOW THEY LEAVE CRIME SCENES,

908
00:45:16,646 --> 00:45:18,548
THE MISSING EVIDENCE,
THE SOUVENIRS,

909
00:45:18,648 --> 00:45:20,851
I HAVE KNOW DOUBT THERE'S
A SERIAL KILLER GOING AROUND,

910
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:22,786
THAT DID THESE MURDERS,
HE MAY BE IN IDAHO NOW,

911
00:45:22,885 --> 00:45:26,023
BUT, I DON'T HAVE
ANY DOUBT ABOUT IT.

912
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:28,025
IT IS SOMEBODY WHO KNEW
WHAT THEY WERE DOING,

913
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:30,094
HAD DONE IT BEFORE,
HAS PROBABLY DONE IT SINCE THEN,

914
00:45:30,193 --> 00:45:33,063
OR WILL DEFINITELY
DO IT AGAIN.

915
00:45:34,563 --> 00:45:37,000
  ( defense )
  ARE YOU AWARE OF
  ANY PERSONALTY TRAITS

916
00:45:37,099 --> 00:45:39,235
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKELY
TO FALSELY CONFESS ?

917
00:45:39,335 --> 00:45:40,503
LOW I.Q.

918
00:45:42,304 --> 00:45:43,806
HIGHLY SUGGESTIBLE,

919
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,609
ALWAYS ATTEMPTING
TO SOLVE

920
00:45:45,708 --> 00:45:48,144
THE IMMEDIATE
STRESS FACTOR...

921
00:45:48,978 --> 00:45:51,914
GET THE INTERROGATORS
OFF MY BACK

922
00:45:52,014 --> 00:45:54,150
AND JUST
LET ME GO HOME...

923
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:56,353
NAIVELY ASSUMES

924
00:45:56,452 --> 00:45:58,588
THAT THEY CAN ALL
STRAIGHTEN IT OUT LATER ON.

925
00:45:58,688 --> 00:46:00,857
IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT

926
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:03,160
FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON
TO BELIEVE...

927
00:46:04,626 --> 00:46:07,230
THAT SOMEONE WOULD CONFESS
TO A CRIME THEY DIDN'T DO,

928
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:09,533
WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE
ABOUT THIS CONFESSION

929
00:46:09,632 --> 00:46:12,702
IS THAT MOST OF IT EMANATED
FROM QUESTIONS RIGHT OFF THE BAT

930
00:46:12,802 --> 00:46:14,771
WITHOUT ANY NARRATIVE

931
00:46:14,871 --> 00:46:17,173
OF ANY LENGTH AT ALL.

932
00:46:17,273 --> 00:46:19,710
WITHOUT ANY DESCRIPTIONS
ABOUT FEELINGS,

933
00:46:19,809 --> 00:46:22,145
OR CONVERSATIONS
OR ANYTHING,

934
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:24,681
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND,

935
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,750
IF HE WAS INVOLVED
IN THIS CRIME

936
00:46:26,849 --> 00:46:29,118
HOW HE MADE A MISTAKE
ON THE TIME FACTOR.

937
00:46:30,286 --> 00:46:32,588
AND THE THING THAT REALLY
BOTHERS ME IS THE LIGATURE,

938
00:46:32,688 --> 00:46:34,857
WHAT WAS USED
TO TIE UP THE VICTIMS,

939
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,760
HE CERTAINLY KNOWS
THE DIFFERENCE

940
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:39,863
BETWEEN SHOE LACES
AND A ROPE,

941
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,800
THAT SHOULD'VE BEEN A SIGNAL

942
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,735
THAT SOMETHING
WAS RADICALLY WRONG.

943
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:47,538
THAT'S WHEN THE QUESTIONS
SHOULD'VE BEEN MORE PROBING

944
00:46:47,637 --> 00:46:49,940
TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT
HE WAS MAKING IT UP

945
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:51,675
OR GIVING
A VALID CONFESSION.

946
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:55,012
   ( prosecutor )
   OUT OF THE 100 OR MORE PEOPLE

947
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:56,747
THAT Y'ALL TALKED TO,

948
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:59,082
  ARE YOU AWARE OF ANYBODY
  OTHER THEN THAN THE DEFENDANT,

949
00:46:59,181 --> 00:47:00,583
  WHO TOLD YOU

950
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:03,019
  ONE OF THE VICTIMS

951
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,822
THAT HAD THEIR
GENITALS REMOVED

952
00:47:05,922 --> 00:47:08,591
AND ONE OF THEM HAD CUTS
TO THE SIDE OF THE FACE,

953
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:11,161
 AND THERE'D BEEN
 SOME GRABBING OF THE EARS ?

954
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:13,297
 THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE
 THAT MENTIONED

955
00:47:13,396 --> 00:47:15,665
 THOSE PARTICULAR INJURIES,

956
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:17,501
AND, YOU YOURSELF,

957
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:20,336
   YOU'RE POINTING TO THE
   WRONG SIDE OF THE CHEEK.

958
00:47:22,237 --> 00:47:25,007
( prosecutor )
WAS THERE ANY KIND
OF EMOTIONAL RESPONSE ?

959
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:27,744
   ( man )
   HE HAD TEARS
   COMING DOWN HIS EYES.

960
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:29,746
 HAD Y'ALL YELLED AT HIM

961
00:47:29,846 --> 00:47:31,715
 OR BEEN MEAN TO HIM,

962
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:33,851
   OR THREATENED HIM,
   OR PROMISED HIM ANYTHING,

963
00:47:33,951 --> 00:47:35,552
   OR ANY
   OF THOSE THINGS ?

964
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:37,954
NONE OF THOSE THINGS
HAPPENED WHATSOEVER.

965
00:48:00,742 --> 00:48:04,114
   ( defense )
   DOCTOR, CAN YOU
   GIVE US SOME EXAMPLES

966
00:48:04,213 --> 00:48:06,549
   OF THE POLICE BEING COERCIVE,
   LEADING OR SUGGESTIVE

967
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,518
  DURING THE COURSE
  OF THE INTERROGATION ?

968
00:48:08,617 --> 00:48:10,119
YES, I CAN,

969
00:48:10,219 --> 00:48:12,655
PERHAPS THE MOST
POWERFUL EXAMPLE,

970
00:48:12,755 --> 00:48:14,724
IN MY OPINION,

971
00:48:14,824 --> 00:48:17,627
IS THE EXAMPLE
OF THE EIGHT REVISITING

972
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:20,731
OF THE QUESTION OF THE TIME

973
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:22,833
AT WHICH
THE KILLINGS OCCURRED.

974
00:48:22,932 --> 00:48:24,768
THE FIRST EXAMPLE

975
00:48:24,867 --> 00:48:27,637
OCCURS ON PAGE THREE,

976
00:48:27,737 --> 00:48:30,806
DET. RIDGE SAYS, "ALRIGHT,
WHEN DID YOU GO WITH THEM ?"

977
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:33,443
MR. MISSKELLEY SAYS,
"THAT MORNING",

978
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:36,512
DET. RIDGE ASKS, "I'M NOT
SAYING WHEN THEY CALLED YOU,

979
00:48:36,612 --> 00:48:38,681
"I'M SAYING
WHAT TIME WAS IT

980
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:41,485
THAT YOU WERE ACTUALLY
THERE IN THE PARK ?"

981
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:44,487
MR. MISSKELLEY SAYS,
"ABOUT NOON."

982
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:47,524
DET. RIDGE NOW SAYS,
"OKAY, WAS IT

983
00:48:47,623 --> 00:48:49,892
AFTER SCHOOL
HAD LET OUT ?"

984
00:48:49,992 --> 00:48:52,028
THIS IS IMMEDIATELY
AFTER JESSIE SAYING

985
00:48:52,128 --> 00:48:53,797
"IT'S AT NOON",

986
00:48:53,896 --> 00:48:55,831
HE'S NOW SUGGESTING
IT MUST BE LATER

987
00:48:55,931 --> 00:48:58,601
BY SAYING, "IS IT
AFTER SCHOOL LET OUT ?"

988
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:01,438
JESSIE SAYS, "YES".

989
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:03,907
DET. RIDGE FOLLOWS UP

990
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:05,909
WITH HIS VICTORY,

991
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:08,244
ON PAGE 24,

992
00:49:08,344 --> 00:49:10,947
AND THIS TIME
DET. RIDGE SAYS,

993
00:49:11,047 --> 00:49:12,848
AND I QUOTE,

994
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:14,684
"OKAY, THE NIGHT

995
00:49:14,784 --> 00:49:16,987
"YOU WERE IN THE WOODS,

996
00:49:17,086 --> 00:49:18,655
"HAD YOU ALL

997
00:49:18,755 --> 00:49:20,691
BEEN IN THE WATER ?"

998
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,492
JESSIE REPLIES,

999
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:24,661
"YEAH, WE'D BEEN
IN THE WATER,

1000
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,896
"WE WERE IN IT
THAT NIGHT

1001
00:49:26,996 --> 00:49:28,764
PLAYING AROUND IN IT."

1002
00:49:28,864 --> 00:49:30,500
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

1003
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:32,368
IN THE RECORD,

1004
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:35,672
THAT IT IS DIRECTLY
SUGGESTED TO JESSIE,

1005
00:49:35,771 --> 00:49:37,641
THAT THE CORRECT ANSWER IS

1006
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:39,643
"THIS HAPPENED AT NIGHT",

1007
00:49:39,742 --> 00:49:41,445
IMMEDIATELY UPON

1008
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:43,547
THAT BEING SUGGESTED,

1009
00:49:43,646 --> 00:49:44,880
JESSIE...

1010
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,085
RESPONDS BY ACCEPTING

1011
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:51,822
AND YOU HE STARTS
TO USE THE WORD "AT NIGHT",

1012
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:54,690
WHERE HE HAD NEVER
USED IT BEFORE,

1013
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:57,894
THAT IS AN INFLUENCE TACTIC,
IT IS A WAY,

1014
00:49:57,994 --> 00:50:00,097
OF GETTING SOMEONE
TO ACCEPT SOMETHING,

1015
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:01,798
OUT OF PRESSURE

1016
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:03,800
AND OUT OF SUGGESTION.

1017
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,836
BUT, THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE,

1018
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:08,805
THERE ARE MANY OTHER EXAMPLES
OF MANIPULATION

1019
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:10,507
ON IMPORTANT POINTS

1020
00:50:10,606 --> 00:50:12,576
THROUGHOUT THIS RECORD.

1021
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:23,753
  ( prosecutor )
  MR. OFSHE,

1022
00:50:23,853 --> 00:50:26,455
IS YOUR GOING RATE
APPROXIMATELY $300 AN HOUR ?

1023
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:27,657
  NO, THAT'S NOT.

1024
00:50:27,757 --> 00:50:28,892
WHAT IS IT ?

1025
00:50:28,992 --> 00:50:31,461
 MY RATE IS A $150 AN HOUR
 FOR CONSULTATION,

1026
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:34,030
 AND $300 AN HOUR FOR TIME
 SPENDING IN COURT

1027
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:35,898
 OR IN DEPOSITION.

1028
00:50:35,998 --> 00:50:38,968
( prosecutor )
SO IF YOU'RE INITIALLY ASKED
TO EVALUATE A CASE,

1029
00:50:39,068 --> 00:50:42,204
YOU DON'T GET
THE $300 AN HOUR

1030
00:50:42,304 --> 00:50:44,673
  UNLESS YOU GIVE AN OPINION
  THAT'S CONSITENT,

1031
00:50:44,773 --> 00:50:46,842
  WITH WHAT THE PERSON ASKED YOU
  WANTS TO HEAR.

1032
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:48,645
   THEY DON'T
  CALL YOU AS A WITNESS,

1033
00:50:48,744 --> 00:50:50,846
 YOU DON'T GET YOUR
 $300 AN HOUR, CORRECT ?

1034
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:52,916
INCORRECT.

1035
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:54,985
   I DON'T KNOW WHAT

1036
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:57,686
 THE TERMINOLOGY IS
 IN BERKELEY CALIFORNIA,

1037
00:50:57,786 --> 00:50:58,989
 BUT...

1038
00:50:59,088 --> 00:51:01,924
   WHEN THE
   DEFENDANT IDENTIFIED

1039
00:51:02,025 --> 00:51:03,927
  WHO IT WAS
  WHO WAS CASTRATED,

1040
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:05,595
   WHEN HE INDICATED

1041
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:07,664
   THAT ONE OF THE BOYS
   WAS CUT IN THE FACE,

1042
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:10,032
  YOU DON'T KNOW AND
  YOU CAN'T GIVE AN OPINION

1043
00:51:10,132 --> 00:51:12,968
 THAT ANY OF THOSE QUESTIONS
 WERE COERCIVE IN NATURE ?

1044
00:51:13,068 --> 00:51:15,538
NO, I CAN'T BECAUSE THE RECORD
THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH

1045
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:17,841
IS VERY INCOMPLETE,

1046
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,875
BECAUSE THIS
PART OF THE RECORD

1047
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:21,744
IS PRECEDED,

1048
00:51:21,844 --> 00:51:24,013
AS EVERYONE AGREES...

1049
00:51:24,114 --> 00:51:26,249
BY OVER TWO HOURS

1050
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:29,019
OF INTERROGATION,

1051
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:31,421
IN WHICH MANY SUBJECTS
WERE DISCUSSED,

1052
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:33,623

JESSIE MISSKELLEY,

1068
00:53:26,869 --> 00:53:28,771
DIDN'T TELL
THE POLICE<i> ANYTHING</i>

1069
00:53:28,871 --> 00:53:30,873
THAT THEY
DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW.

1070
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:33,876
THEY LED HIM HIM THROUGH
THIS ENTIRE TAPED STATEMENT.

1071
00:53:33,976 --> 00:53:35,945
AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
OF THE JURY,

1072
00:53:36,045 --> 00:53:37,646
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED

1073
00:53:37,746 --> 00:53:39,515
BEFORE THEY TURNED
THE TAPE RECORDER ON.

1074
00:53:39,615 --> 00:53:41,550
THEY DIDN'T
VIDEOTAPE IT,

1075
00:53:41,650 --> 00:53:43,953
THE OFFICERS DIDN'T TAKE NOTES
ON ALL THE QUESTIONS,

1076
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,822
THEY TESTIFIED TO THAT.

1077
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:47,856
THEY EVEN TESTIFIED
THAT THEY COULDN'T REMEMBER

1078
00:53:47,956 --> 00:53:49,625
SOME OF THE THINGS
THEY ASKED HIM.

1079
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,728
HOW DO WE KNOW

1080
00:53:51,827 --> 00:53:53,496
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED ?

1081
00:53:53,596 --> 00:53:55,699
THE DEFENSE,
THROUGH BRINGING IN,

1082
00:53:55,798 --> 00:53:58,534
SO-CALLED EXPERTS,
SUCH AS MR. OFSHE,

1083
00:53:58,635 --> 00:54:00,570
HAVE TRIED
THROUGH SMOKE AND MIRRORS

1084
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:02,572
TO MAKE IT SOUND LIKE,

1085
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:05,541
A PERSON THAT CONFESSES
TO SUCH A HEINOUS CRIME,

1086
00:54:05,641 --> 00:54:07,743
AND ADMITS
THEIR INVOLVEMENT

1087
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:09,813
AND GIVES YOU SPECIFIC DETAILS
IN THE INVOLVEMENT,

1088
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,947
THAT'S INDICATIVE
OF SOMEONE,

1089
00:54:12,047 --> 00:54:14,984
WHO WAS FORCED
OR COERCED TO CONFESS.

1090
00:54:15,518 --> 00:54:17,353
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
OF THE JURY,

1091
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:19,722
MY CLIENT,
LITTLE JESSIE MISSKELLEY,

1092
00:54:19,822 --> 00:54:21,757
IS AN
INNOCENT MAN.

1093
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:24,060
HE'S INNOCENT.

1094
00:54:24,159 --> 00:54:26,730
AND I WOULD ASK YOU TO
GO BACK TO THAT JURY ROOM,

1095
00:54:26,829 --> 00:54:29,598
AND BRING BACK A VERDICT
THAT RINGS OF JUSTICE,

1096
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:32,335
TRUTH AND JUSTICE,

1097
00:54:32,434 --> 00:54:34,971
AND I WOULD ASK YOU
TO BRING BACK A VERDICT

1098
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:37,873
THAT YOU CAN LIVE WITH
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

1099
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:40,744
( prosecutor )
SEE THIS PICTURE ?

1100
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:42,979
THIS IS THE MOORE BOY.

1101
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:45,148
THIS DEFENDANT WON'T LOOK UP,

1102
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:46,883
HE WON'T LOOK AT YOU,

1103
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:49,452
BUT THIS
DEFENDANT'S ACTIONS,

1104
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:52,188
YOU JUST
THINK ABOUT IT,

1105
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:53,923
IF THIS DEFENDANT

1106
00:54:54,023 --> 00:54:56,925
DOES NOT CHASE DOWN
MICHAEL MOORE...

1107
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:01,497
IF HE DOES NOT RUN THROUGH
THE WOODS AND CHASE HIM DOWN

1108
00:55:01,597 --> 00:55:03,666
AND BRING HIM BACK,

1109
00:55:03,766 --> 00:55:05,801
MICHAEL MOORE LIVES.

1110
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:07,871
MICHAEL MOORE
GETS TO GO HOME AT NIGHT,

1111
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:10,673
HIS PARENTS
GET TO BE WITH HIM.

1112
00:55:10,773 --> 00:55:13,175
BUT, BECAUSE OF
THIS DEFENDANT'S ACTIONS...

1113
00:55:14,275 --> 00:55:17,212
BECAUSE OF WHAT
JESSIE MISSKELLEY JR. DID,

1114
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:19,081
MICHAEL MOORE'S DEAD,

1115
00:55:19,181 --> 00:55:20,783
STEVIE BRANCH IS DEAD,

1116
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:23,152
AND CHRIS BYERS IS DEAD,

1117
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:25,188
AND THERE'S NO
GETTING AROUND IT.

1118
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:27,990
I THINK WHEN YOU GO BACK AND
YOU APPLY YOUR COMMON SENSE

1119
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:29,858
AND YOU DO WHAT'S RIGHT,

1120
00:55:29,958 --> 00:55:31,994
AND YOU THINK ABOUT
THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE,

1121
00:55:32,094 --> 00:55:33,562
YOU'RE GONNA KNOW

1122
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,632
THAT WHAT
THE EVIDENCE SHOWS IS,

1123
00:55:35,731 --> 00:55:38,802
THAT THIS DEFENDANT
RAN DOWN MICHAEL MOORE,

1124
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:41,137
THAT THIS DEFENDANT WAS THERE,

1125
00:55:41,237 --> 00:55:43,106
HE WAS INVOLVED,

1126
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:44,541
AND HE'S GUILTY

1127
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:47,077
OF THREE COUNTS
OF CAPITAL MURDER.

1128
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,878
3-2-1.

1129
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:51,947
THE JURY WENT OUT
AT 4:20 THIS AFTERNOON,

1130
00:55:52,047 --> 00:55:54,149
THEY'LL DECIDE IF
JESSIE MISSKELLEY IS GUILTY

1131
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:55,684
IN THE DEATHS OF
CHRISTOPHER BYERS,

1132
00:55:55,784 --> 00:55:57,853
MICHAEL MOORE
AND STEVEN BRANCH.

1133
00:55:57,954 --> 00:55:59,856
MISSKELLEY IS CHARGED
WITH CAPITAL MURDER,

1134
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:02,759
AND, IF GUILTY,
COULD GET THE DEATH PENALTY.

1135
00:56:02,858 --> 00:56:05,127
TWO OTHER TEEN-AGERS
CHARGED IN THE CRIME,

1136
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:07,996
WILL BE TRIED LATER THIS MONTH
IN JONESBORO.

1137
00:56:08,097 --> 00:56:10,100
IN CORNING,

<i> A.R.N. NEWS.</i>

1139
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,836
SHORT BUT SWEET.

1140
00:56:17,139 --> 00:56:19,142
( woman )
CAN'T YOU
TWITCH YOUR NOSE

1141
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:21,644
  AND MAKE THEM COME BACK
  WITH A "NOT GUILTY" VERCDICT ?

1142
00:56:21,744 --> 00:56:23,579
IF I COULD TWITCH MY NOSE
AND DO THAT,

1143
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:26,014
  I'D HAVE BEEN GONE
  A LONG TIME AGO.

1144
00:56:27,248 --> 00:56:29,985
( woman )
THERE'S STILL HOPE.

1145
00:56:30,085 --> 00:56:32,221
( Jessie )
I'M NOT GIVING UP,
THOUGH.

1146
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:34,657
DON'T EVER !

1147
00:56:34,757 --> 00:56:38,061
DON'T GET IN THERE
AND GET MAD AND GO OFF...

1148
00:56:39,228 --> 00:56:42,065
   THEY TELL ME, "HOW COME HE
   ALWAYS KEEPS HIS HEAD DOWN ?"

1149
00:56:43,465 --> 00:56:46,568
   BECAUSE I WAS<i> TOLD</i>
   TO KEEP MY HEAD DOWN.

1150
00:56:46,668 --> 00:56:48,737
  IF YOU'D RAISE UP
  AND LOOK AROUND

1151
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:51,608
  THEN, THEY'D BE
  SAYING SOMETHING ELSE.

1152
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:53,843
( woman )
DON'T LET
IT BOTHER YOU.

1153
00:56:53,943 --> 00:56:56,079
( Jessie Sr. )
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE
SAYING ABOUT DAMIEN,

1154
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:58,947
ALWAYS STRETCHIN' HIS NECK,
LOOKIN' AROUND.

1155
00:56:59,581 --> 00:57:01,518
DAMIEN'S A GOOD KID.

1156
00:57:01,617 --> 00:57:04,887
I GUESS,
I DON'T KNOW !

1157
00:57:04,987 --> 00:57:07,956
( woman )
I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW MUCH
I LOVED HIM UNTIL THIS.

1158
00:57:08,056 --> 00:57:10,225
I ALWAYS LOVED HIM,
BUT THIS IS JUST--

1159
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:11,894
WELL, THANKS A LOT !

1160
00:57:11,994 --> 00:57:13,663
YOU KNOW
I ALWAYS LOVED YOU,

1161
00:57:13,762 --> 00:57:16,065

 YOU'RE COMING HOME.

1163
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,703
( man )
YOU GOTTA
GET OUT OF HERE.

1164
00:57:21,804 --> 00:57:24,541
JUST SAY A PRAYER
WHEN THE JURY COMES OUT.

1165
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:27,409
   'CAUSE WE'LL
   BE SITTING THERE

1167
00:57:29,945 --> 00:57:31,947
FOR YOU.

1168
00:57:33,615 --> 00:57:35,717
 WE HOPE WE CAN
 CARRY YOU HOME.

1169
00:57:50,266 --> 00:57:52,202
IT'S KIND
OF HORRIBLE.

1170
00:57:58,106 --> 00:58:00,009
  YOU GOTTA
  LEARN TO CONTROL IT.

1171
00:58:04,512 --> 00:58:07,951
   ( judge )
   ALRIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
   IN THE AUDIENCE,

1172
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:10,686
  I AM ACUTELY AWARE THAT...

1173
00:58:11,987 --> 00:58:12,889
   YOU'RE...

1174
00:58:13,722 --> 00:58:15,825
   FEELINGS ARE ALL ON EDGE,

1175
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:19,128
   THAT THERE'S A GREAT DEAL
   OF EMOTION INVOLVED,

1176
00:58:19,228 --> 00:58:21,130
 BUT THE COURT
 CANNOT TOLERATE

1177
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:22,764
  AND<i> WILL</i> NOT TOLERATE,

1178
00:58:22,864 --> 00:58:24,700
   ANY VERBAL OUTBURSTS,

1179
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,670
 ANY DISPLAY OF
 EMOTION WHATSOEVER,

1180
00:58:27,769 --> 00:58:29,972

   THAT'S DIFFICULT

1181
00:58:30,072 --> 00:58:32,841

1191
00:58:53,762 --> 00:58:55,565
 "IN THE DEATH
 OF CHRIS BYERS,

1192
00:58:55,664 --> 00:58:57,833
SIGNED BY
T.J. WILLIAMS, FOREMAN."

1193
00:58:57,934 --> 00:58:59,802
ALRIGHT, MR. MISSKELLEY,

1194
00:58:59,902 --> 00:59:01,971
   IF YOU COULD COME
   AROUND THE FRONT HERE

1195
00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:03,739
AND DAN,

1196
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:07,143
MR. MISSKELLEY, DID YOU HEAR
THE JURY'S FINDING

1197
00:59:07,242 --> 00:59:09,612
  AND THE READING OF
  THE VERDICT IN YOUR CASE ?

1198
00:59:09,711 --> 00:59:11,014
YES, SIR.

1199
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:13,583
   DO YOU HAVE ANY
   LEGAL REASON OR CAUSE

1200
00:59:13,682 --> 00:59:15,617
   TO TELL THE COURT
   WHY SENTENCE

1201
00:59:15,717 --> 00:59:18,453
  SHOULD NOT BE
  IMPOSED AT THIS TIME ?

1202
00:59:18,554 --> 00:59:20,690
 I HEARD YOU BUT

1203
00:59:20,789 --> 00:59:22,425
  YOU NEED TO ANSWER OUT
  A LITTLE BIT LOUDER.

1204
00:59:22,525 --> 00:59:23,425
  NO, SIR.

1205
00:59:23,525 --> 00:59:24,726
ALRIGHT,

1206
00:59:24,827 --> 00:59:26,930
   IS THERE ANYTHING
   YOU WANNA SAY

1207
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:28,932
 BEFORE SENTENCE
 IS IMPOSED ?

1208
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:30,900
 YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO
 MAKE ANY STATEMENT

1209
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,036
   YOU CARE TO
   AT THIS TIME.

1210
00:59:33,135 --> 00:59:35,871
 ARE YOU SATISFIED
 WITH THE SERVICE AND ADVICE

1211
00:59:35,972 --> 00:59:37,840
OF YOUR ATTORNEYS
THROUGH THIS TRIAL ?

1212
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:39,474
 YES, SIR.

1213
00:59:39,574 --> 00:59:41,577
 ALRIGHT, BASED UPON
 THE JURY'S VERDICT,

1214
00:59:41,677 --> 00:59:43,545
 FINDING YOU GUILTY
 OF FIRST DEGREE MURDER

1215
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:45,548
   IN THE DEATH
   OF MICHAEL MOORE,

1216
00:59:45,648 --> 00:59:47,951
   YOU'LL BE SENTENCED TO THE
   ARKANSAS DEPT. OF CORRECTIONS

1217
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:49,686
 FOR A TERM OF LIFE,

1218
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:52,588
 IN THE COUNT INVOLVING
 THE DEATH OF STEVEN BRANCH,

1219
00:59:52,688 --> 00:59:55,457
THE JURY HAVING FOUND YOU GUILTY
OF SECOND DEGREE MURDER,

1220
00:59:55,557 --> 00:59:58,994
YOU'LL BE SENTENCED TO AN
ADDITIONAL TERM OF 20 YEARS,

1221
00:59:59,094 --> 01:00:00,829
AND IN REGARD TO

1222
01:00:00,929 --> 01:00:02,998
   THE DEATH
   OF CHRISTOPHER BYERS,

1223
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:05,535
THE JURY HAVING FOUND YOU GUILTY
OF SECOND DEGREE MURDER,

1224
01:00:05,635 --> 01:00:08,438
  YOU WILL BE SENTENCED TO
  AN ADDITIONAL TERM OF 20 YEARS

1225
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:10,539
   IN THE ARKANSAS DEPT.
   OF CORRECTIONS,

1226
01:00:10,639 --> 01:00:14,242
  THAT IS YOU WILL RECEIVE
  A LIFE SENTENCE PLUS 40 YEARS.

1227
01:00:14,342 --> 01:00:15,744
IT'S HARD
TO THINK OF HOW

1228
01:00:15,844 --> 01:00:18,880
IT WOULD'VE GONE
ANY OTHER WAY,

1229
01:00:18,981 --> 01:00:21,250
BUT YOU CAN NEVER
TELL WITH A JURY OF 12,

1230
01:00:21,349 --> 01:00:23,152
THEY COULD'VE FOUND
A VERDICT OF NOT GUILTY,

1231
01:00:23,251 --> 01:00:25,654
AND WE HAD TO SIT THERE
AND TELL OURSELVES,

1232
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:27,624
"GOD GRANT US THE SERENITY

1233
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:29,592
"TO ACCEPT THE THINGS
WE CANNOT CHANGE

1234
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:31,760
"THE COURAGE TO
CHANGE THE THINGS WE CAN

1235
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:34,163
AND THE WISDOM
TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE."

1236
01:00:34,262 --> 01:00:36,398
SO WE HAD TO BE WILLING
TO ACCEPT WHAT HAPPENED,

1237
01:00:36,498 --> 01:00:38,934
AND THANKFULLY
THE VERDICT WENT OUR WAY.

1238
01:00:39,034 --> 01:00:40,702
  ( reporter )
  THERE MUST BE
  MIXED EMOTIONS

1239
01:00:40,802 --> 01:00:42,605
 BECAUSE YOU HAD
 THE GUILTY VERDICT

1240
01:00:42,704 --> 01:00:45,842
  BUT YOU STILL HAVE
  THE LOSS TO DEAL WITH.

1241
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:48,710
 THIS DOESN'T
 CHANGE ANYTHING.

1242
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:51,079
 CHRISTOPHER'S DEAD,

1243
01:00:51,179 --> 01:00:53,849
 AND HE WAS
 TORTURED TO DEATH

1244
01:00:53,949 --> 01:00:56,251
 BY THREE MURDERING BASTARDS

1245
01:00:56,351 --> 01:00:57,753
 ON A DITCH BANK,

1246
01:00:57,853 --> 01:00:59,554
 HE WAS 8 YEARS OLD.

1247
01:00:59,655 --> 01:01:01,524
 AND GUILTY IS GUILTY.

1248
01:01:01,623 --> 01:01:03,859
 AND I HOPE THE LITTLE SUCKER,
 WHEN HE HITS PRISON,

1249
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,063
 THEY GET HIS ASS
 RIGHT OFF THE BAT !

1250
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:08,764
 BECAUSE HE
 DESERVES TO BE

1251
01:01:08,864 --> 01:01:10,532
 TORTURED AND PUNISHED

1252
01:01:10,632 --> 01:01:12,734
 FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE

1253
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:16,239
 FOR MURDERING THREE
 8 YEAR OLD CHILDREN !

1254
01:01:18,139 --> 01:01:20,777
( reporter )
HOW COME YOU KEPT YOUR
HEAD DOWN THE WHOLE TIME ?

1255
01:01:20,876 --> 01:01:23,913
 ( reporter )
 JESSIE, ANYTHING
 YOU WANNA SAY NOW ?

1256
01:01:24,012 --> 01:01:26,215
( reporter )
DID YOU DO IT,
JESSIE ?

1257
01:01:31,085 --> 01:01:33,021
( reporter )
DID YOU DO IT, JESSIE ?

1258
01:01:39,193 --> 01:01:41,864
 ( reporter )
 HOW ARE YOU
 FEELING RIGHT NOW ?

1259
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:49,672
 ( car starts )

1260
01:01:57,346 --> 01:01:59,347
   PRISON'S NOT
   A SAFE PLACE.

1261
01:02:01,315 --> 01:02:03,285
JESSIE, SWEETIE.

1262
01:02:04,152 --> 01:02:06,188
   I'M GONNA
   MAIL HIM A SKIRT.

1263
01:02:08,056 --> 01:02:10,025
 ( Mark )
 ONE DOWN TWO TO GO.

1264
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:12,595
HOPEFULLY THE SAME THING
WILL HAPPEN TO THE NEXT TWO,

1265
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:14,797
   AND WE'LL GET
   THE SAME VERDICT.

1266
01:02:31,713 --> 01:02:34,484
THEY FOUND
MY SON'S TESTICLES

1267
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:36,752
IN A JAR OF ALCOHOL

1268
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:39,121
IN DAMIEN ECHOL'S HOUSE,

1269
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:42,225
WITH HIS FINGERPRINTS
ON THE JAR.

1270
01:02:42,324 --> 01:02:44,926
NOW, HOW DO YOU
DISPUTE THAT ?

1271
01:02:45,027 --> 01:02:46,896
SOME IDIOT STARTED
A RUMOR SAYING THAT

1272
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:49,198
THEY FOUND UMM...

1273
01:02:52,134 --> 01:02:54,103
CHILDREN'S SEXUAL PARTS

1274
01:02:54,202 --> 01:02:55,938
UNDER MY BED

1275
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:58,106
OR IN MY HOUSE.

1276
01:02:59,474 --> 01:03:02,644
AND THERE WAS NO
BODY PARTS IN MY HOUSE.

1277
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:10,820
I THINK MAYBE THE POLICE
HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.

1278
01:03:12,554 --> 01:03:15,490
IF THEY CAN MAKE US LOOK BAD
IN FRONT OF THE PUBLIC,

1279
01:03:15,590 --> 01:03:17,926
PEOPLE ARE GONNA KINDA
HAVE THEIR MINDS MADE UP,

1280
01:03:18,027 --> 01:03:20,563
BEFORE ANYTHING
EVER COMES OUT.

1281
01:03:33,608 --> 01:03:36,545
WE WANNA TALK TO YOU ABOUT
ALL THIS STUFF IN THE PAPER

1282
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:39,015
ABOUT A DEAL
WITH JESSIE.

1283
01:03:39,114 --> 01:03:41,683
RIGHT NOW WE DON'T KNOW

1284
01:03:41,784 --> 01:03:43,653
WHAT HIS SITUATION IS,

1285
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:46,455
ALTHOUGH WE THINK HE IS MORE
INCLINED TO TESTIFY RIGHT NOW

1286
01:03:46,554 --> 01:03:48,690
THAN HE HAS BEEN
AT ANY POINT,

1287
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:50,793
UP TO NOW.

1288
01:03:50,893 --> 01:03:53,362
THE FRIDAY THAT
JESSIE WAS CONVICTED,

1289
01:03:53,461 --> 01:03:55,998
BY QUESTIONING, THE OFFICERS
THAT TOOK HIM DOWN

1290
01:03:56,097 --> 01:03:58,233
INQUIRED OF HIM
WHAT HAD REALLY HAPPENED,

1291
01:03:58,333 --> 01:04:00,669
APPARENTLY, JESSIE, CONTRARY
TO SOMEBODY THAT WAS INNOCENT,

1292
01:04:00,769 --> 01:04:03,605
THAT WOULD SAY THINGS LIKE,
"GEE, I'VE JUST BEEN CONVICTED,

1293
01:04:03,706 --> 01:04:06,576
I DIDN'T DO IT,
WHAT A TERRIBLE INJUSTICE",

1294
01:04:06,675 --> 01:04:08,443
JESSIE TALKED
ALL THE WAY DOWN THERE

1295
01:04:08,543 --> 01:04:10,445
ABOUT HOW
HE COMMITTED THE CRIME,

1296
01:04:10,545 --> 01:04:12,714
AND SPECIFIC DETAILS,

1297
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:15,318
UNFORTUNATELY WE NEED
HIS TESTIMONY REAL BAD.

1298
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:17,854
IF IT WAS
A PERFECT WORLD,

1299
01:04:17,954 --> 01:04:21,057
WE WOULD TAKE WHAT WE
HAVE ON JESSIE AND LEAVE IT,

1300
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:23,492
AND WE'D GO AND
GET THE OTHER TWO,

1301
01:04:23,592 --> 01:04:25,528
AND GET THEM
AND BE HAPPY,

1302
01:04:25,628 --> 01:04:27,496
BUT IT'S NOT,

1303
01:04:27,596 --> 01:04:29,664
AND, WE NEED HIS TESTIMONY

1304
01:04:29,764 --> 01:04:32,134
TO BE SURE WE GET
CONVICTIONS ON THE OTHER TWO.

1305
01:04:32,233 --> 01:04:33,835
I THINK WE'RE GONNA

1306
01:04:33,936 --> 01:04:35,905
NEGOTIATE HIS
SENTENCE DOWN SOME

1307
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:38,374
IN ORDER TO
GET HIM TO TESTIFY.

1308
01:04:38,474 --> 01:04:40,643
HE'S NOT GONNA
TESTIFY JUST

1309
01:04:40,742 --> 01:04:42,978
OUT OF THE GOODNESS
OF HIS HEART,

1310
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:45,047
THE ONLY WAY THAT
I THINK

1311
01:04:45,146 --> 01:04:47,016
THAT HE WILL
BE WILLING TO TESTIFY,

1312
01:04:47,115 --> 01:04:49,684
IS IF THE LIFE SENTENCE
IS REMOVED.

1313
01:04:52,621 --> 01:04:55,057
I DO WANNA SAY,
ALL IS NOT LOST,

1314
01:04:55,157 --> 01:04:57,559
IF HE DOESN'T TESTIFY,

1315
01:04:57,659 --> 01:05:01,163
BUT THE ODDS ARE
REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY.

1316
01:05:02,831 --> 01:05:04,767
WE STILL GOT
SOME EVIDENCE.

1317
01:05:04,867 --> 01:05:06,736
WHAT WE'VE GOT,
BESIDES JESSIE,

1318
01:05:06,835 --> 01:05:08,770
WE GOT...

1319
01:05:11,106 --> 01:05:13,809
A FIBER THAT WAS FOUND ON,

1320
01:05:13,909 --> 01:05:16,878
IT WAS FOUND
ON STEVIE'S SHIRT,

1321
01:05:16,978 --> 01:05:18,880
THAT MATCHED THE FIBER

1322
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:21,617
FROM JASON BALDWIN'S MOTHER,

1323
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:23,786
WHICH IS CALLED
SECONDARY TRANSFER.

1324
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:27,789
WE'VE GOT
A FIBER FROM A SHIRT,

1325
01:05:27,889 --> 01:05:30,125
OR A COUPLE OF FIBERS
FROM A SHIRT

1326
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:32,762
FOUND AT ECHOL'S HOUSE,

1327
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:33,996
FOUND...

1328
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:36,965
ONE OF 'EM WAS ON
MICHAEL'S CUB SCOUT CAP,

1329
01:05:37,065 --> 01:05:38,934
ANOTHER ONE
MAYBE ON THE SHIRT,

1330
01:05:39,034 --> 01:05:40,635
THAT MATCHED DAMIEN'S.

1331
01:05:40,735 --> 01:05:43,172
FIBER EVIDENCE,
IN MY OPINION,

1332
01:05:43,271 --> 01:05:45,240
IS BETTER
THAN HAIR EVIDENCE,

1333
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:47,676
BUT THEY CAN'T SAY
THAT IT CAME FROM

1334
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,947
THAT PARTICULAR GARMENT
TO EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHERS.

1335
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:52,548
WE'VE GOT

1336
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:54,650
THE HOLLINGSWORTH CLAN

1337
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:57,186
THAT SAYS THEY SAW DAMIEN
OUT ON THE SERVICE ROAD,

1338
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:59,021
WE'VE GOT SOME...

1339
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:01,691
KIDS THAT SAY THAT

1340
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:04,927
THEY HEARD HIM
AT A GIRL'S SOFTBALL GAME,

1341
01:06:05,027 --> 01:06:07,996
OVERHEARD HIM SAY
THAT HE KILLED THE THREE BOYS

1342
01:06:08,097 --> 01:06:10,099
AND HE WAS GONNA
KILL TWO MORE

1343
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:13,235
BEFORE HE
TURNED HIMSELF IN.

1344
01:06:13,335 --> 01:06:15,737
  ( man )
  THEY HAVEN'T SCARED THEM OFF,
  LIKE THEY DID THE OTHER ONES ?

1345
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:18,173
  NO, NOT YET.

1346
01:06:18,273 --> 01:06:19,708
  WE'VE GOT...

1347
01:06:21,208 --> 01:06:23,812
  A GUY THAT WAS
  IN JAIL WITH JASON

1348
01:06:23,913 --> 01:06:26,481
WHO SAYS THAT
JASON MADE SOME

1349
01:06:26,581 --> 01:06:28,483
INCRIMINATING
STATEMENTS TO HIM,

1350
01:06:28,583 --> 01:06:31,086
NOW, THERE ARE SOME THINGS
THAT THEY'RE GONNA TRY TO DO

1351
01:06:31,186 --> 01:06:33,989
TO ATTACK
THIS KID'S CREDIBILITY.

1352
01:06:34,989 --> 01:06:36,825
THEN WE'VE GOT THE KNIFE
THAT WAS FOUND

1353
01:06:36,925 --> 01:06:39,161
IN THE LAKE
BEHIND JASON'S HOUSE,

1354
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:41,063
SO, THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT,

1355
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:43,565
BUT, THAT'S<i> ALL</i>
BASICALLY WE GOT.

1356
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:46,902
YOU ASKED WHAT THE ODDS WERE OF
CONVICTING THEM WITHOUT JESSIE

1357
01:06:47,001 --> 01:06:49,005
AND IT'S 50-50,

1358
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:51,240
NOT BE GOOD.

1359
01:06:59,981 --> 01:07:01,717
 ( man )
 THE ONLY WAY
 HE'LL COME UP THERE

1360
01:07:01,817 --> 01:07:03,786
   AND SIT DOWN
   IN THAT WITNESS CHAIR

1361
01:07:03,885 --> 01:07:05,554
AND TESTIFY,

1362
01:07:05,653 --> 01:07:07,757
  IS IF THEY CUT HIM
  A SWEET DEAL,

1363
01:07:07,856 --> 01:07:10,759
YOU TAKE ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE
WRONG WITH HIS STATEMENT

1364
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,362
 AND THEN ADD
 TO THAT RECIPE MIX,

1365
01:07:13,461 --> 01:07:16,798
 THAT I'M TALKIN' NOW
 BECAUSE I GOT A SWEET DEAL,

1366
01:07:16,898 --> 01:07:20,068
   AND I'M GONNA GET OUT
   IN 10 YEARS,

1367
01:07:20,168 --> 01:07:21,804
 HYPOTHETICALLY,

1368
01:07:21,903 --> 01:07:24,005
 I MAY GET OUT
 IN 10 YEARS.

1369
01:07:25,072 --> 01:07:27,042
   HECK, WHO<i> WOULDN'T</i> SING ?

1370
01:07:27,143 --> 01:07:28,543
   YOU KNOW
   WHAT I'M SAYING ?

1371
01:07:28,643 --> 01:07:30,712
 THEN, HIS EVIDENCE,
 HIS STATEMENT,

1372
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:33,449
HIS WHOLE THING
LOOKS BAD,

1373
01:07:33,548 --> 01:07:36,184
  IF THAT'S THEIR BEST EVIDENCE,
  AND TRUST ME, IT IS,

1374
01:07:36,284 --> 01:07:38,019
  IF THEY CAN'T USE
 THAT STATEMENT AGAINST YOU,

1375
01:07:38,119 --> 01:07:40,121
   THEY GOT NOTHIN'.

1376
01:07:40,956 --> 01:07:42,958
  AND THIS DOG AND PONY SHOW
  IS OVER.

1377
01:07:56,471 --> 01:07:58,039
  'MORNING.

1378
01:07:58,139 --> 01:08:00,708
( reporter )
ARE THE RUMOR'S FALSE
ABOUT JESSIE TURNING ?

1379
01:08:04,945 --> 01:08:06,781
IS IT TRUE THAT
JESSIE'S GONNA TESTIFY

1380
01:08:06,882 --> 01:08:08,517
AGAINST DAMIEN
AND JASON ?

1381
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:10,152
   THAT'S FALSE.

1382
01:08:11,952 --> 01:08:13,721
  I JUST LEFT JESSIE
  AT THE JAIL

1383
01:08:13,822 --> 01:08:15,891
   AND HE TOLD ME THAT
   HE WAS NOT GONNA TESTIFY,

1384
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:17,926
  HE DIDN'T WANT TO
  GET UP THERE AND LIE,

1385
01:08:18,027 --> 01:08:20,563
 THAT THE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN
 WORKING ON HIM REAL HARD,

1386
01:08:20,662 --> 01:08:22,897
   BUT, HE WASN'T
   GONNA LISTEN TO THEM,

1387
01:08:22,997 --> 01:08:25,166
 AND HIS DECISION WAS FINAL,

1388
01:08:25,266 --> 01:08:27,869
  BUT HE CAN ALWAYS
  CHANGE HIS MIND AGAIN,

1389
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:29,637
  HE HAS,

1390
01:08:29,738 --> 01:08:31,941
HE'S A VERY CONFUSED
AND SCARED KID,

1391
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:34,243
   AND THE OFFICERS
   HAVE SCARED HIM TO DEATH.

1392
01:08:35,911 --> 01:08:38,380
LAST NIGHT I SAID, JESSIE,
IF YOU GET UP THERE AND LIE,

1393
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:40,482
I'M GONNA BE
IN THAT COURTROOM,

1394
01:08:40,582 --> 01:08:42,684
AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
SIT THERE AND TELL THAT LIE,

1395
01:08:42,784 --> 01:08:44,752
WHEN YOU KNOW THAT I'M
SITTING THERE LISTENING TO YOU,

1396
01:08:44,853 --> 01:08:46,689
WHEN YOU KNOW
I KNOW THAT YOU ARE LYING.

1397
01:08:56,730 --> 01:08:59,201
( reporter )
DAMIEN, ARE YOU
IN A CULT ?

1398
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:02,037
ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT JESSIE
TESTIFYING AGAINST YOU ?

1399
01:09:07,442 --> 01:09:10,246
  ( prosecutor )
  IN LOOKING AT YOUNG PEOPLE

1400
01:09:10,345 --> 01:09:11,846
 INVOLVED IN THE OCCULT,

1401
01:09:11,947 --> 01:09:15,184
  DO YOU SEE ANY
  PARTICULAR TYPE OF DRESS ?

1402
01:09:15,283 --> 01:09:17,118
I HAVE PERSONALLY OBSERVED

1403
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:18,887
PEOPLE WEARING

1404
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:21,023
BLACK FINGER NAILS,

1405
01:09:21,122 --> 01:09:23,858
HAVING THEIR
HAIR PAINTED BLACK,

1406
01:09:23,958 --> 01:09:26,095
WEARING BLACK T-SHIRTS...

1407
01:09:27,362 --> 01:09:30,832
SOMETIMES THEY WILL
TATOO THEMSELVES.

1408
01:09:32,199 --> 01:09:34,636
 ( prosecutor )
 DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION
 AS TO WHETHER OR NOT

1409
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:37,472
 THERE ARE OCCULT OVERTONES,

1410
01:09:37,573 --> 01:09:39,708
  OR EVIDENCE OF
  OCCULT INVOLVEMENT

1411
01:09:39,807 --> 01:09:42,211
IN THESE
PARTICULAR MURDERS ?

1412
01:09:43,944 --> 01:09:47,148
  WELL, THE DATE
  BEING CLOSE TO...

1413
01:09:47,248 --> 01:09:48,983
 <i> BELTING...</i>

1414
01:09:50,217 --> 01:09:52,020
   A HOLIDAY, MAY 1,

1415
01:09:52,121 --> 01:09:53,922
ALSO...

1416
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:57,092
 THE DAY BEFORE
 THAT IS A HOLIDAY,

1417
01:09:57,192 --> 01:09:58,827
  THEN YOU GO INTO

1418
01:09:58,926 --> 01:10:00,996
   THE FACT THAT SOME

1419
01:10:01,095 --> 01:10:02,597
   GROUPS,

1420
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:04,934
   OCCULT, CULT GROUPS,

1421
01:10:05,033 --> 01:10:08,237
   WILL USE A FULL MOON.

1422
01:10:10,639 --> 01:10:13,676
   IN SEVERAL OCCULT BOOKS,

1423
01:10:13,775 --> 01:10:17,179
 THEY WILL TALK ABOUT
 THE LIFE FORCE OF THE BLOOD.

1424
01:10:17,945 --> 01:10:20,748
 USUALLY THE YOUNGER
 THE INDIVIDUAL,

1425
01:10:20,849 --> 01:10:23,085
 THE MORE PURE IT IS.

1426
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:26,622
 THE MORE POWER
 OR FORCE IT HAS.

1427
01:10:26,721 --> 01:10:29,858
 A LOT OF TIMES
 THEY WILL TAKE BLOOD

1428
01:10:29,957 --> 01:10:31,826
 AND STORE IT
 FOR OTHER SERVICES,

1429
01:10:31,926 --> 01:10:33,929
 AND OTHER USE,

1430
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:35,864
 AS WELL AS CONSUME IT,

1431
01:10:35,963 --> 01:10:38,033
 OR BATHE IN IT.

1432
01:10:38,867 --> 01:10:40,703
  NOW THE...

1433
01:10:41,836 --> 01:10:43,771
 ITEM THAT'S
 DRAWN ON THE FRONT,

1434
01:10:43,872 --> 01:10:45,507
  WHAT IS THAT ?

1435
01:10:45,606 --> 01:10:47,743
THAT IS A PENTAGRAM,

1436
01:10:47,842 --> 01:10:49,711
THAT HAPPENS TO BE
A "WICCAN",

1437
01:10:49,811 --> 01:10:52,747
OR WHITE WITCHCRAFT
PENTAGRAM.

1438
01:10:52,847 --> 01:10:55,583
   ( prosecutor )
   NOW, IF YOU OPEN THE BOOK
   TO THE FRONT PAGE.

1439
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:57,086
   YES, SIR.

1440
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:00,989
 ( prosecutor )
 NOW...

1441
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:02,458
   EXPLAIN
   WHAT THAT IS.

1442
01:11:02,557 --> 01:11:04,560
THAT'S CONFUSION TO ME.

1443
01:11:04,659 --> 01:11:07,829
THE REASON WHY IS
WE GOT A WHITE WITCHCRAFT...

1444
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:10,932
"WICCAN" PENTAGRAM,

1445
01:11:11,033 --> 01:11:13,469
THEN WE HAVE
UPSIDE-DOWN CROSSES,

1446
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:15,904
WHICH COMES FROM ANOTHER
TYPE OF A OCCULTISM.

1447
01:11:16,003 --> 01:11:17,840
 WHAT TYPE ?

1448
01:11:17,939 --> 01:11:19,540
THAT'S<i> BLACK</i> WITCHCRAFT.

1449
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:22,010
( prosecutor )
IS IT "WICCA", SATANISM,

1450
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:23,112
  OR BOTH ?

1451
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:23,946
BOTH.

1452
01:11:24,945 --> 01:11:27,181
  AND DID YOU NOTICE
  ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR

1453
01:11:27,282 --> 01:11:29,752
ABOUT THE BOOK ?

1454
01:11:29,851 --> 01:11:32,520
THERE'S A CHAPTER IN HERE CALLED
"RISE OF THE DEVIL"

1455
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:34,222
 AND...

1456
01:11:37,192 --> 01:11:39,828
IT IS UNDERLINED IN RED.

1457
01:11:39,927 --> 01:11:43,231
AND THERE ARE A COUPLE
OF SENTENCES IN THERE,

1458
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:44,700
REFERENCE TO

1459
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,201
BLOOD,

1460
01:11:46,301 --> 01:11:48,270
AND IT'S LIFE FORCE.

1461
01:11:50,238 --> 01:11:53,008
   HOW WERE YOU ACCEPTED
   INTO ENROLLMENT

1462
01:11:53,108 --> 01:11:55,644
 AT COLUMBIA PACIFIC
 UNIVERSITY ?

1463
01:11:55,743 --> 01:11:59,081
   I HAD TO FILL OUT
   SEVERAL SERIES OF PAPERS

1464
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:01,215
   INCLUDING
   ALL MY EDUCATION,

1465
01:12:01,315 --> 01:12:04,118
 BACKGROUND, EXPERIENCE.

1466
01:12:04,886 --> 01:12:07,956
  DID YOU EVER FILL OUT
  A LITTLE FLYER LIKE THIS ?

1467
01:12:08,055 --> 01:12:09,724
NO, SIR.

1468
01:12:09,824 --> 01:12:12,094
IT SAYS, "CALL TOLL-FREE
FOR INFORMATION

1469
01:12:12,194 --> 01:12:14,229
ON HOW TO BECOME A DOCTOR ?"

1470
01:12:16,965 --> 01:12:19,400
THIS IS A MAIL ORDER COLLEGE,
ISN'T IT ?

1471
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:21,970
   ( defense )
   WHAT CLASSES DID YOU TAKE

1472
01:12:22,069 --> 01:12:23,938
   BETWEEN 1980 AND 1982

1473
01:12:24,038 --> 01:12:26,140
  TO OBTAIN
  YOUR MASTER'S DEGREE ?

1474
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:29,811
 WHAT CLASSES ?

1475
01:12:29,912 --> 01:12:31,046
  I TESTIFIED--

1476
01:12:31,145 --> 01:12:32,780
 I'M ASKING YOU,

1477
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:34,783
  WHAT CLASSES
  DID YOU TAKE ?

1478
01:12:34,882 --> 01:12:36,652
I ANSWERED THAT
BEFORE, NONE.

1479
01:12:36,752 --> 01:12:38,620
   YOU DID NOT
   TAKE ANY CLASSES,

1480
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:41,690
   BETWEEN 1982 AND 1984

1481
01:12:41,789 --> 01:12:43,891
 WHEN YOU BECAME A PH.D.

1482
01:12:43,992 --> 01:12:45,761
  WHAT CLASSES
  DID YOU TAKE ?

1483
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:46,929
 NONE.

1484
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:49,131
  NONE, O.K.

1485
01:12:50,664 --> 01:12:52,768
 IS IT YOUR OPINION,

1486
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:55,270
   AND DO YOU WANT
   TO TELL THIS JURY...

1487
01:12:56,671 --> 01:12:59,074
  THAT THESE CRIMES,

1488
01:12:59,173 --> 01:13:01,577
 WERE MOTIVATED
 BY OCCULT BELIEFS ?

1489
01:13:01,676 --> 01:13:02,810
YES.

1490
01:13:10,217 --> 01:13:11,819
( man )
WE'RE NOT TRASH,

1491
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,622
BY NO MEANS,

1492
01:13:13,721 --> 01:13:16,125
BY SON WAS BORN
IN WEST MEMPHIS,

1493
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:18,193
HE WAS RAISED
IN WEST MEMPHIS,

1494
01:13:18,292 --> 01:13:20,328
AND FOR THE LIFE OF ME,
I CANNOT UNDERSTAND

1495
01:13:20,429 --> 01:13:23,498
WHY PEOPLE HAVE GOT
THIS BAD IMAGINE OF HIM.

1496
01:13:24,565 --> 01:13:27,403
SO WHAT IF HE WORE
A BLACK TRENCH COAT ?

1497
01:13:27,502 --> 01:13:30,405
HE'S NOT THE
ONLY ONE THAT DOES.

1498
01:13:33,274 --> 01:13:35,577
SO WHAT IF HE
WORE BLACK T-SHIRTS,

1499
01:13:35,676 --> 01:13:37,645
BLACK PANTS ?

1500
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:40,615
JOHNNY CASH WEARS BLACK,
DOESN'T HE ?

1501
01:13:40,716 --> 01:13:43,452
   I WEAR BLACK,
   MICHELLE WEARS BLACK,

1502
01:13:43,551 --> 01:13:47,188
DOMINI WEARS BLACK !

1503
01:13:48,189 --> 01:13:50,759
  WE'RE ALL JUST
  PARTIAL TO BLACK, I GUESS.

1504
01:13:50,859 --> 01:13:52,895
I LIKE BLACK MYSELF.

1505
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:56,698
AND, I'M BY NO MEANS
NO DEVIL WORSHIPER,

1506
01:13:56,797 --> 01:13:58,699
NOR IS HE.

1507
01:13:58,800 --> 01:13:59,868
HE WAS GOIN' TO SCHOOL,

1508
01:13:59,967 --> 01:14:01,836
HE WANTED TO GO TO SCHOOL
TO BE A PRIEST,

1509
01:14:01,936 --> 01:14:03,771
HE WAS FAITHFUL
IN THE CHURCH.

1510
01:14:03,872 --> 01:14:05,908
HE LOOKED INTO

1511
01:14:06,007 --> 01:14:08,210
A LITTLE BIT OF "WICCA",

1512
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:09,878
BUT, HE NEVER

1513
01:14:09,978 --> 01:14:11,880
WENT TO IT,

1514
01:14:11,979 --> 01:14:14,649
AND I THINK IF PEOPLE
LOOKED INTO WHAT "WICCA" IS

1515
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:16,885
THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND IT
A LITTLE BETTER.

1516
01:14:16,984 --> 01:14:18,519
THE ONLY THING WICCANS DO,

1517
01:14:18,619 --> 01:14:21,289
IS WORSHIP THE EARTH.

1518
01:14:30,532 --> 01:14:33,502
( Damien )
PEOPLE PROBABLY THINK
THAT I'M INTO SATANISM

1519
01:14:33,601 --> 01:14:35,938
BECAUSE USUALLY WHAT
PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND

1520
01:14:36,037 --> 01:14:38,105
THEY TRY TO DESTROY...

1521
01:14:38,972 --> 01:14:40,641
OR RIDICULE.

1522
01:14:41,676 --> 01:14:43,846
TRY TO MAKE IT
LOOK BAD OR WRONG.

1523
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:48,783
WEST MEMPHIS IS
PRETTY MUCH LIKE

1524
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:50,685
SECOND SALEM.

1525
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:55,890
BECAUSE EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENS HERE,

1526
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:57,559
NO MATTER WHAT IT IS,

1527
01:14:57,658 --> 01:14:59,961
IT'S BLAMED ON SATANISM.

1528
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:07,369
( judge )
HE'S BEEN
PREVIOUSLY SWORN.

1529
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:08,904
CORRECT.

1530
01:15:12,239 --> 01:15:13,774
  ( defense )
  PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME
  FOR THE COURT.

1531
01:15:13,875 --> 01:15:15,577
   DAMIEN WAYNE ECHOLS.

1532
01:15:15,676 --> 01:15:18,012
  WHY DID YOU
  CHANGE YOUR NAME ?

1533
01:15:18,113 --> 01:15:20,749
I WAS VERY INVOLVED
IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH,

1534
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:23,886
AND WE WERE GOING OVER
DIFFERENT NAMES OF THE SAINTS,

1535
01:15:23,985 --> 01:15:26,320
ST. MICHAELS WAS
WHERE I WENT TO CHURCH,

1536
01:15:26,421 --> 01:15:28,891
AND WE HEARD
ABOUT THIS GUY

1537
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:31,960
FROM THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS,

1538
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:34,530
FATHER DAMIEN,

1539
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:37,632
THAT TOOK CARE OF LEPERS,

1540
01:15:37,733 --> 01:15:40,536
UNTIL HE FINALLY CAUGHT
THE DISEASE HIMSELF AND DIED.

1541
01:15:40,636 --> 01:15:43,505
  ( defense )
  WAS THAT THE REASON YOU CHOOSE
  DAMIEN AS YOUR FIRST NAME ?

1542
01:15:43,604 --> 01:15:45,072
YES, IT IS.

1543
01:15:45,172 --> 01:15:46,474
DID THE CHOOSING
OF THE NAME "DAMIEN"

1544
01:15:46,574 --> 01:15:48,876
 HAVE ANYTHING
 TO DO WITH ANY TYPE OF

1545
01:15:48,976 --> 01:15:50,845
HORROR MOVIES, SATANISM,

1546
01:15:50,945 --> 01:15:52,847
CULTISM,
ANY OF THAT NATURE ?

1547
01:15:52,948 --> 01:15:54,682
NOTHING
WHATSOEVER.

1548
01:15:54,783 --> 01:15:57,052
   AFTER THE TIME PERIOD
   THAT YOU WERE REALLY

1549
01:15:57,152 --> 01:15:59,587
  INTO THE
  CATHOLIC RELIGION,

1550
01:15:59,688 --> 01:16:02,925
 DID YOU START FOCUSING
ON ANOTHER PARTICULAR RELIGION ?

1551
01:16:03,890 --> 01:16:05,293
  "WICCA".

1552
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:07,729
 COULD YOU EXPLAIN TO THE LADIES
 AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY

1553
01:16:07,828 --> 01:16:11,166
   SOME PRINCIPALS ABOUT
   THE WICCA RELIGION ?

1554
01:16:13,768 --> 01:16:16,672
IT ACKNOWLEDGES A GODDESS
IN A HIGHER REGARD

1555
01:16:16,771 --> 01:16:18,472
AS A GOD,

1556
01:16:18,573 --> 01:16:20,976
BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS SAID
WE ARE ALL GOD'S CHILDREN,

1557
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:22,743
AND MEN CANNOT
HAVE CHILDREN.

1558
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:27,516
IT'S BASICALLY LIKE

1559
01:16:27,615 --> 01:16:29,984
A CLOSE INVOLVEMENT
WITH NATURE.

1560
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:31,853
   IS THERE
   A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

1561
01:16:31,953 --> 01:16:34,823
  THE WICCA RELIGION
   AND WITCHCRAFT ?

1562
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:39,360
( Damien )
WICCA IS ALSO
CALLED "WITCHCRAFT",

1563
01:16:39,461 --> 01:16:42,364
THE WORD "WICCA"
WAS BASTARDIZED,

1564
01:16:42,463 --> 01:16:44,399
IT ORIGINALLY
MEANT "WISE ONE".

1565
01:16:44,498 --> 01:16:47,469
 DID THE FACT THAT YOU LIKE
 TO WEAR BLACK ALL THE TIME,

1566
01:16:47,569 --> 01:16:51,173
 WERE YOU DIFFERENT
 IN OTHER WAYS AS WELL ?

1567
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:54,610
YES, I'VE NEVER HAD
A LOT OF THE SAME INTERESTS

1568
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:56,545
THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE,

1569
01:16:56,645 --> 01:16:58,480
LIKE SPORTS,
THINGS LIKE THAT,

1570
01:16:58,579 --> 01:17:00,615
I'VE NEVER BEEN
INTO ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

1571
01:17:00,716 --> 01:17:03,619
 DID IT HELP YOU
 DEAL WITH OTHER PEOPLE

1572
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:06,587
TO HAVE PEOPLE
KIND OF STAND-OFFISH

1573
01:17:06,688 --> 01:17:08,523
AND SORT OF
BACK AWAY FROM YOU ?

1574
01:17:08,622 --> 01:17:11,158
YEAH, IT WAS LIKE
A DEFENSE MECHANISM,

1575
01:17:11,259 --> 01:17:13,028
IT WOULD MAKE
PEOPLE THINK LIKE,

1576
01:17:13,127 --> 01:17:15,063
WELL HE'S WEIRD
I'M NOT GONNA GO AROUND HIM,

1577
01:17:15,162 --> 01:17:17,765
SO, IT KEPT PEOPLE AWAY.

1578
01:17:17,865 --> 01:17:20,002
 THE STATE
 INTRODUCED THE BOOK

1579
01:17:20,101 --> 01:17:22,804
"NEVER ON A BROOMSTICK",

1580
01:17:22,904 --> 01:17:25,841
  ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH
  THAT PARTICULAR BOOK ?

1581
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:27,341
  YES, I AM.

1582
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:29,543
 WHERE DID YOU
 GET THAT BOOK, DAMIEN ?

1583
01:17:29,644 --> 01:17:31,813
AT THE LIBRARY,

1584
01:17:31,912 --> 01:17:34,515
ALL THE BOOKS THAT THEY WERE
GETTIN' TIRED OF

1585
01:17:34,615 --> 01:17:36,551
OR HAD FOR A LONG TIME,

1586
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:38,753
THEY HAD THEM
SITTIN' ON A RACK OUT FRONT,

1587
01:17:38,854 --> 01:17:40,956
THAT THEY WERE SELLING
FOR 10 CENTS EACH,

1588
01:17:41,055 --> 01:17:42,623
SO I GOT IT.

1589
01:17:42,724 --> 01:17:46,128
   DID YOU UNDERLINE ANY OF
   THOSE PORTIONS IN THE BOOK ?

1590
01:17:46,228 --> 01:17:48,130
THAT WAS DONE
WHEN I GOT IT,

1591
01:17:48,229 --> 01:17:50,431
I THINK IT WAS BECAUSE SOMEBODY
HAD A REPORT TO DO,

1592
01:17:50,532 --> 01:17:52,734
'CAUSE ALL DURING THE BOOK
THERE'S LITTLE NOTES,

1593
01:17:52,833 --> 01:17:54,603
CERTAIN DATES AND STUFF,

1594
01:17:54,703 --> 01:17:56,338
LIKE FROM THE 1600'S

1595
01:17:56,438 --> 01:17:58,640
IN THE OUTSIDE MARGIN.

1596
01:17:58,739 --> 01:18:01,542
   SO WAS THAT BOOK KIND OF LIKE
   A HISTORY OF WITCHCRAFT

1597
01:18:01,643 --> 01:18:03,545
  AND HOW IT'S DEVELOPED
  OVER THE AGES ?

1598
01:18:03,645 --> 01:18:05,147
   YES.

1599
01:18:05,247 --> 01:18:08,050
 ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH
 THE CONTENTS OF THAT NOTEBOOK ?

1600
01:18:08,149 --> 01:18:09,250
YES, I AM.

1601
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:11,686
 I NOTICED ON THE INSIDE
 OF THE FRONT COVER

1602
01:18:11,787 --> 01:18:13,822
   THERE APPEARS TO BE
   A COUPLE OF QUOTES THERE,

1603
01:18:13,921 --> 01:18:16,891
  COULD YOU READ
  EACH OF THOSE TO THE JURY

1604
01:18:16,992 --> 01:18:19,927
  AND TELL THEM
  WHERE THAT CAME FROM ?

1605
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:21,797
"LIFE IS BUT
A WALKING SHADOW,

1606
01:18:21,896 --> 01:18:24,032
"IT IS A TALE
TOLD BY AN IDIOT,

1607
01:18:24,131 --> 01:18:26,500
FULL OF SOUND AND FURY
SIGNIFYING NOTHING."

1608
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,670
THAT'S FROM A
"MIDSUMMER'S NIGHT'S DREAM",

1609
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:30,906
BY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.

1610
01:18:31,006 --> 01:18:33,208
"PURE BLACK
LOOKING CLEAR,

1611
01:18:33,307 --> 01:18:35,143
"MY WORK IS
SOON DONE HERE,

1612
01:18:35,243 --> 01:18:37,579
TRY GETTING BACK FROM ME,
THAT WHICH USED TO BE."

1613
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:40,649
THAT IS OFF
A<i> METALLICA</i> TAPE,

1614
01:18:40,748 --> 01:18:43,150
CALLED "AND JUSTICE FOR ALL",

1615
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:45,820
TALKS ABOUT HOW WARPED
THE COURT SYSTEMS ARE,

1616
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:48,557
AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

1617
01:18:48,657 --> 01:18:50,726
   ON MAY THE 5TH...

1618
01:18:52,493 --> 01:18:54,563
 DID YOU KILL
 MICHAEL MOORE ?

1619
01:18:54,662 --> 01:18:56,697
 NO, I DID NOT.

1620
01:18:56,797 --> 01:18:58,632
ON MAY THE 5TH,

1621
01:18:58,733 --> 01:19:00,902
DID YOU KILL
STEVIE BRANCH ?

1622
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:02,537
   NO, I DID NOT.

1623
01:19:02,636 --> 01:19:04,405
ON MAY THE 5TH,

1624
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:06,408
DID YOU KILL
CHRIS BYERS ?

1625
01:19:06,507 --> 01:19:07,775
   NO, I DID NOT.

1626
01:19:07,876 --> 01:19:10,712
HAVE YOU EVER PARTICIPATED
IN ANY TYPE OF HUMAN SACRIFICE ?

1627
01:19:10,811 --> 01:19:12,747
NO, I HAVE NOT.

1628
01:19:14,047 --> 01:19:15,817
19 YEAR OLD
DAMIEN ECHOLS

1629
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:18,120
ADMITS HE
STANDS OUT IN A CROWD.

1630
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:20,856
HE SAYS HE LOVES
HEAVY METAL MUSIC--

1631
01:19:25,626 --> 01:19:27,762
3-2-1...

1632
01:19:27,863 --> 01:19:31,066
19 YEAR OLD
DAMIEN ECHOLS SAYS--

1633
01:19:31,166 --> 01:19:33,034
3-2-1...

1634
01:19:34,402 --> 01:19:38,073
19 YEAR OLD DAMIEN ECHOLS
ADMITS HE STANDS OUT IN A CROWD.

1635
01:19:38,172 --> 01:19:40,341
HE SAYS HE LIKES TO
WEAR BLACK MOST OF THE TIME,

1636
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:42,543
PRACTICES
THE "WICCA" RELIGION,

1637
01:19:42,644 --> 01:19:44,512
AND LOVES
HEAVY METAL MUSIC,

1638
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:46,981
BUT HE SAYS HE'S
DEFINITELY NOT A KILLER.

1639
01:19:50,283 --> 01:19:51,952
( woman )
I BELIEVE THEY DID IT,

1640
01:19:52,052 --> 01:19:54,523
AND IF THEY WERE TO BE

1641
01:19:54,622 --> 01:19:56,924
SET FREE ON THE STREET,

1642
01:19:57,024 --> 01:19:59,360
THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO
LOOK BEHIND THEIR BACK,

1643
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,429
WATCH BEHIND THEIR BACK,

1644
01:20:01,529 --> 01:20:03,765
TO SEE IF PAM HOBBS
WOULDN'T FOLLOW 'EM.

1645
01:20:03,864 --> 01:20:06,134
BECAUSE I'M JUST
SAYING THIS AS A HUMAN.

1646
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:08,170
I WOULD,

1647
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:10,172
I BELIEVE I'D
TRY TO KILL THEM TWO,

1648
01:20:10,271 --> 01:20:12,707
IF THEY EVER
WALKED THE STREET,

1649
01:20:12,806 --> 01:20:14,975
AND I'M STILL ALIVE.

1650
01:20:15,076 --> 01:20:17,045
I BELIEVE
I'D BE STALKING THEM.

1651
01:20:17,878 --> 01:20:19,814
TO DO TO THEM...

1652
01:20:20,914 --> 01:20:23,885
PROBABLY SHOOT 'EM,
AND THEN CUT 'EM UP.

1653
01:20:23,984 --> 01:20:27,087
( woman )
WHEN I WAS DOWN AT THE COURTROOM
AND DAMIEN WALKED PAST ME,

1654
01:20:27,188 --> 01:20:29,224
I WANTED TO GO OVER THERE,
AND TAKE MY HAND

1655
01:20:29,323 --> 01:20:30,991
AND JUST
CLAW DOWN HIS FACE,

1656
01:20:31,091 --> 01:20:33,060
INFLICT ANY KIND OF PAIN,

1657
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:35,430
THAT I COULD
INFLICT ON HIM.

1658
01:20:35,529 --> 01:20:37,898
I KNOW, EVENTUALLY,
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FORGIVE 'EM,

1659
01:20:37,998 --> 01:20:39,934
  I UNDERSTAND THAT,

1660
01:20:40,034 --> 01:20:42,703
 BUT WHEN IT HAPPENS
 IN YOUR HOME

1661
01:20:42,804 --> 01:20:45,373
 AND YOU WATCH YOUR WIFE
 LOSE HER MIND,

1662
01:20:45,472 --> 01:20:47,908
AND WHATEVER
HAPPENED TO HER,

1663
01:20:48,009 --> 01:20:50,811
 YOUR HOME IS TORE APART
 AND BUSTED UP,

1664
01:20:50,912 --> 01:20:53,682
 I DON'T FEEL IT'S FAIR

1665
01:20:53,782 --> 01:20:55,717
 RIGHT NOW,

1666
01:20:55,817 --> 01:20:59,287
FOR SOMEONE TO ASK ME TO FORGIVE
THE ONES THAT CAUSED IT.

1667
01:21:00,988 --> 01:21:02,724
IT'LL TAKE SOME TIME,

1668
01:21:02,823 --> 01:21:04,259
A LONG TIME,

1669
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:05,994
BEFORE I COULD
FORGIVE 'EM.

1670
01:21:06,094 --> 01:21:08,762
   ( man )
   YOU SAY THAT IT'S
   GONNA TAKE TIME,

1671
01:21:08,863 --> 01:21:11,867
   WE DON'T KNOW
   HOW MUCH TIME WE GOT,

1672
01:21:11,966 --> 01:21:14,935
 AND WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE
 TO SEE STEVIE AGAIN,

1673
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:17,137
   WE HAVE TO
   FORGIVE IN OUR HEART,

1674
01:21:17,238 --> 01:21:18,940
   BECAUSE THE LORD,

1675
01:21:19,039 --> 01:21:20,774
 FORGAVE<i> US,</i>

1676
01:21:20,875 --> 01:21:22,911
  HE FORGAVE US,

1677
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:24,779
HE SHEDDED HIS BLOOD

1678
01:21:24,878 --> 01:21:26,648
FOR<i> US.</i>

1679
01:21:26,747 --> 01:21:28,916
HE SHEDDED
HIS BLOOD FOR<i> THEM.</i>

1680
01:21:30,717 --> 01:21:32,953
AND HE JUST ASKED US

1681
01:21:33,054 --> 01:21:35,222
TO HAVE A...

1682
01:21:36,023 --> 01:21:37,692
   FORGIVING SPIRIT.

1683
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:39,527
   NOW, I REFUSE,

1684
01:21:39,627 --> 01:21:41,563
 TO SERVE SIN AND SATAN.

1685
01:21:44,564 --> 01:21:46,934
   BECAUSE I'M GONNA
   SEE STEVIE AGAIN,

1686
01:21:47,034 --> 01:21:48,702
  I'M GONNA BE
  WITH STEVIE AGAIN,

1687
01:21:48,802 --> 01:21:50,805
   I'M GONNA BE
   WITH MY MOTHER AGAIN.

1688
01:21:50,904 --> 01:21:52,706
   I'M GONNA BE WITH
   YOUR GRANDMOTHER,

1689
01:21:52,806 --> 01:21:54,809
   BOTH OF THEM.

1690
01:21:54,908 --> 01:21:57,045
   I'M GONNA BE WITH
   ALL OF MY LOVED ONES,

1691
01:21:57,145 --> 01:21:59,881
 THAT HAVE PASSED ON
 AND WENT TO HEAVEN.

1692
01:22:25,072 --> 01:22:28,109
   ( man )
   IF YOU COULD
   SPEAK TO THE FAMILIES...

1693
01:22:29,042 --> 01:22:31,947
   OF THESE KIDS
   WHO THINK YOU DID IT,

1694
01:22:32,046 --> 01:22:34,148
 WHAT WOULD YOU
 SAY TO THEM ?

1695
01:22:46,793 --> 01:22:48,262
I DON'T KNOW.

1696
01:22:54,268 --> 01:22:55,971
( Damien )
JASON WAS MY BEST FRIEND,

1697
01:22:56,070 --> 01:22:58,105
WE DID ABOUT
EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

1698
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:01,543
IT WAS KIND OF LIKE WE EVEN
LIVED TOGETHER MOST OF THE TIME,

1699
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:03,578
STAYED AT
EACH OTHERS HOUSES,

1700
01:23:03,677 --> 01:23:06,081
WORE EACH OTHER'S CLOTHES.

1701
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:08,082
IT WAS MORE LIKE
WE WERE BROTHERS.

1702
01:23:08,182 --> 01:23:10,484
WE USED TO GO OUT AND
SNAKE HUNT ALL THE TIME.

1703
01:23:12,286 --> 01:23:13,855
SNAKES AND MUSIC

1704
01:23:13,954 --> 01:23:16,256
WERE ABOUT OUR
WHOLE LIFE REALLY.

1705
01:23:19,726 --> 01:23:22,630
WE WERE ALL THE TIME
LOOKIN' FOR NEW GROUPS,

1706
01:23:22,729 --> 01:23:25,099
THAT WE WOULD LIKE.

1707
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:27,469
OUR FAVORITE
KINDS OF MUSIC

1708
01:23:27,569 --> 01:23:30,505
 WERE LIKE<i> SLAYER,
 METALLICA, MEGADETH.</i>

1709
01:23:33,006 --> 01:23:33,741
  <i> U2... </i>

1710
01:23:39,979 --> 01:23:42,616
WOULD WE WOULD DO JUST ABOUT
EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

1711
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:47,822
 ( prosecutor )
 I WANNA DRAW YOUR ATTENTION

1712
01:23:47,921 --> 01:23:50,125
  BACK TO AUGUST
  OF LAST YEAR,

1713
01:23:50,225 --> 01:23:52,927
  WERE YOU WERE IN THE CRAIGHEAD
  JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITY ?

1714
01:23:53,027 --> 01:23:54,295
  YES, I WAS.

1715
01:23:54,395 --> 01:23:56,197
  AND WHAT WERE YOU
  IN THERE FOR AT THE TIME ?

1716
01:23:56,296 --> 01:23:57,464
  BURGLARY.

1717
01:23:58,599 --> 01:24:00,935
AND, WHEN
YOU WERE THERE,

1718
01:24:01,034 --> 01:24:03,704
 WAS THERE
 A JASON BALDWIN

1719
01:24:03,805 --> 01:24:05,707
  IN THE JUVENILE
  DETENTION FACILITY

1720
01:24:05,806 --> 01:24:07,375
  AT THE SAME TIME ?

1721
01:24:07,475 --> 01:24:08,843
YES.

1722
01:24:08,943 --> 01:24:11,646
  WHILE YOU WERE IN CONTACT
  WITH THIS JASON BALDWIN,

1723
01:24:11,746 --> 01:24:14,449
WAS THERE ANYTHING MENTIONED
ABOUT HIS INVOLVEMENT

1724
01:24:14,548 --> 01:24:16,518
 IN THE MURDERS OF THE THREE
 EIGHT YEAR OLDS ?

1725
01:24:16,618 --> 01:24:19,020
YES, WE WERE SITTING THERE
PLAYING SPADES

1726
01:24:19,119 --> 01:24:21,555
AND I WANTED TO GET TO KNOW
EVERYBODY OFF IN THERE,

1727
01:24:21,655 --> 01:24:23,891
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'D CALL IT,

1728
01:24:23,992 --> 01:24:26,061
BUT, I JUST WANTED
TO GET TO KNOW HIM,

1729
01:24:26,161 --> 01:24:28,163
AND I JUST STRAIGHT OUT
ASKED HIM IF HE DID IT

1730
01:24:28,262 --> 01:24:30,564
AND HE DENIED IT
THE FIRST TIME.

1731
01:24:30,997 --> 01:24:33,634
  DID YOU HAVE AN OCCASION AGAIN
  WHILE YOU WERE THERE

1732
01:24:33,734 --> 01:24:36,470
TO ASK HIM
WAS HE INVOLVED

1733
01:24:36,570 --> 01:24:38,605
 IN THE MURDERS OF
 THE THREE EIGHT YEAR OLDS ?

1734
01:24:38,706 --> 01:24:39,774
 YES.

1735
01:24:39,873 --> 01:24:41,943
 I THINK IT WAS
 LIKE THE NEXT DAY.

1736
01:24:42,042 --> 01:24:44,478
 I BELIEVE IT WAS
 THE NEXT DAY.

1737
01:24:44,578 --> 01:24:48,082
 AND CAN YOU TELL US
 WHAT WAS GOING ON,

1738
01:24:48,182 --> 01:24:50,652
WHAT WAS HAPPENING
AT THE TIME THAT OCCURRED ?

1739
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:53,555
ME AND JASON WERE
SCRAPIN' UP THE CARDS,

1740
01:24:53,654 --> 01:24:56,090
GOIN' TO OUR CELLS FOR LUNCH,

1741
01:24:56,190 --> 01:24:58,859
AND I SAID, "JUST BETWEEN
ME AND YOU, I WON'T SAY A WORD,

1742
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,561
DID YOU DO IT ?"

1743
01:25:00,662 --> 01:25:02,530
AND HE SAID "YES",
AND HE WENT INTO DETAIL.

1744
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:04,998
  WHAT DID HE TELL YOU ?

1745
01:25:05,099 --> 01:25:06,900
HE TOLD ME

1746
01:25:07,001 --> 01:25:08,936
HOW HE
DISMEMBERED THE KID,

1747
01:25:09,037 --> 01:25:11,206
OR I DON'T KNOW
EXACTLY HOW MANY KIDS,

1748
01:25:11,305 --> 01:25:13,140
HE JUST SAID
HE DISMEMBERED 'EM,

1749
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:15,443
HE SUCKED THE BLOOD
FROM THE PENIS AND SCROTUM,

1750
01:25:15,542 --> 01:25:18,212
AND PUT THE BALLS
IN HIS MOUTH.

1751
01:25:18,313 --> 01:25:19,747
  ( prosecutor )
  NOW MICHAEL,

1752
01:25:19,846 --> 01:25:21,515
  WHEN WAS IT

1753
01:25:21,615 --> 01:25:23,685
  THAT YOU...

1754
01:25:23,784 --> 01:25:26,019
 CAME FORWARD
 WITH THIS INFORMATION ?

1755
01:25:26,119 --> 01:25:27,889
I'M NOT REALLY SURE,

1756
01:25:27,988 --> 01:25:29,857
I BELIEVE IT WAS LIKE
A COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER.

1757
01:25:29,957 --> 01:25:31,826
 WHAT CAUSED YOU
 TO COME FORWARD

1758
01:25:31,926 --> 01:25:33,695
  AT THAT POINT IN TIME,

1759
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:36,931
WHY DID MICHAEL CARSON NO LONGER
WANNA STAY UNINVOLVED,

1760
01:25:37,030 --> 01:25:39,934
   WHY DID YOU COME FORWARD
   IN FEBRUARY THIS YEAR ?

1761
01:25:40,033 --> 01:25:41,802
   'CAUSE I SAW
   THE FAMILY ON TV,

1762
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:44,005
  I SAW HOW
  BROKEN-HEARTED THEY WERE

1763
01:25:44,104 --> 01:25:45,939
  ABOUT THEIR
  CHILDREN BEING MISSING,

1764
01:25:46,039 --> 01:25:48,510
  AND I GOT A SOFT HEART,
  I COULDN'T TAKE IT.

1765
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:05,326
( defense )
NOW, HE TELLS YOU THIS
AND THEN YOU'RE<i> SILENT...</i>

1766
01:26:06,493 --> 01:26:08,630
FROM AUGUST,

1767
01:26:08,729 --> 01:26:11,732
UNTIL FEBRUARY,
IS THAT RIGHT ?

1768
01:26:11,832 --> 01:26:13,033
   YES, SIR.

1769
01:26:13,134 --> 01:26:15,203
 AND IN THE SECOND CONVERSATION
 YOU'VE EVER HAD

1770
01:26:15,302 --> 01:26:17,639
 WITH THIS YOUNG MAN
 IN HIS ENTIRE LIFE

1771
01:26:17,738 --> 01:26:19,740
   HE TELLS YOU
   ALL THIS STUFF ?

1772
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:21,142
  YES, SIR.

1773
01:26:21,242 --> 01:26:23,878
  AFTER HE'S HAD
 <i> ONE</i> CONVERSATION WITH YOU.

1774
01:26:23,978 --> 01:26:25,846
 ( Carter )
 YES, SIR.

1775
01:26:28,282 --> 01:26:30,518
( man )
ONE DAY WHEN
I WAS UP HERE WORKIN',

1776
01:26:30,618 --> 01:26:32,720
THE PHONE RINGS,
SECRETARY SAYS,

1777
01:26:32,819 --> 01:26:35,689
YOU WON'T KNOW WHO HE IS
BUT HE NEEDS TO TALK TO YOU,

1778
01:26:35,789 --> 01:26:37,559
I PICK UP THE PHONE,
HE SAYS I'M DANNY WILLIAMS,

1779
01:26:37,658 --> 01:26:39,594
I'M EMBARRASSED TO TELL YOU
WHAT I NEED TO TELL YOU,

1780
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:42,030
HE SAID BUT I WORK WITH
THE JUVENILE DEPARTMENT HERE,

1781
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:43,898
AND I DO DRUG
AND ALCOHOL COUNSELING,

1782
01:26:43,997 --> 01:26:46,900
AND THERE'S A GUY
NAMED MICHAEL CARSON

1783
01:26:47,001 --> 01:26:49,170
WHO'S GONNA TESTIFY THAT

1784
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:50,939
JASON CONFESSED
TO HIM IN JAIL

1785
01:26:51,038 --> 01:26:52,773
AND I KNOW HE'S LYING.

1786
01:26:52,873 --> 01:26:54,809
I SAID,
WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT ?

1787
01:26:54,908 --> 01:26:56,978
HE SAID, WELL,
SEVERAL MONTHS AGO,

1788
01:26:57,078 --> 01:26:58,846
MICHAEL CARSON WAS

1789
01:26:58,945 --> 01:27:00,881
ONE OF THE KIDS
THAT I WORKED WITH,

1790
01:27:00,981 --> 01:27:02,216
AND...

1791
01:27:03,449 --> 01:27:06,220
HE AND I HAD A CONVERSATION
WHERE I TOLD HIM

1792
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,021
THAT THIS JASON BALDWIN

1793
01:27:08,122 --> 01:27:10,792
HAD BEEN ACCUSED OF
KILLING THREE BOYS

1794
01:27:10,891 --> 01:27:12,894
AND SEXUALLY MUTILATING THEM.

1795
01:27:12,993 --> 01:27:14,528
AND BASICALLY,

1796
01:27:14,628 --> 01:27:16,764
HE GAVE MICHAEL CARSON
THE DETAILS

1797
01:27:16,863 --> 01:27:18,932
THAT HE TESTIFIED TO
AT THE TRIAL.

1798
01:27:19,033 --> 01:27:21,536
AT THE TIME
CARSON SAYS NOTHING...

1799
01:27:23,604 --> 01:27:25,673
AND THEN CARSON
LATER TELLS HIM,

1800
01:27:25,773 --> 01:27:27,675
"HEY, BY THE WAY DANNY,

1801
01:27:27,774 --> 01:27:29,943
"I'M TELLIN' THE POLICE

1802
01:27:30,043 --> 01:27:32,012
THAT JASON
CONFESSED TO ME",

1803
01:27:32,113 --> 01:27:34,548
SO HE CALLS ME UP
AND SAYS NO, NO,

1804
01:27:34,649 --> 01:27:36,784
THIS KID'S A LIAR,
HE'S NO GOOD,

1805
01:27:36,884 --> 01:27:38,819
I KNOW HE'S LYING,

1806
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,788
AND THE ONLY REASON
HE'S GOT THIS INFORMATION

1807
01:27:40,887 --> 01:27:42,390
IS BECAUSE
I GAVE IT TO HIM.

1808
01:27:42,489 --> 01:27:44,925
   THE COUNSELOR OF THIS KID
   CALLED THE PROSECUTION

1809
01:27:45,025 --> 01:27:47,494
  AND TOLD 'EM
  WHAT A LIAR HE WAS

1810
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:49,931
AND THE PROSECUTION
STILL USED THE KID,

1811
01:27:50,030 --> 01:27:52,065
  AND NOW THEY'RE TRYIN'
  TO KEEP OUT THE FACT

1812
01:27:52,166 --> 01:27:54,235
 THE BACKGROUND
 OF THE KID.

1813
01:27:54,335 --> 01:27:55,936
OBVIOUSLY WE WANNA
GET THAT INFORMATION OUT

1814
01:27:56,037 --> 01:27:59,140
BUT THE JUDGE ACTS LIKE HE
MIGHT NOT LET US USE IT AT ALL.

1815
01:27:59,239 --> 01:28:01,541
WE SHOULD ABSOLUTELY
BE ABLE TO

1816
01:28:01,641 --> 01:28:04,045
LET THAT JURY KNOW
THAT HE IS

1817
01:28:04,145 --> 01:28:06,047
<i> LSD</i> DEPENDENT,

1818
01:28:06,146 --> 01:28:08,649
BECAUSE IT DOES EFFECT
HIS ABILITY TO RECALL.

1819
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:11,019
THE JUDGE TAKES
ALL THAT AWAY FROM US

1820
01:28:11,118 --> 01:28:12,819
AND SAYS, THE KID
LOOKS PRETTY BELIEVABLE.

1821
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:15,456
   NOT ONLY ARE THEY KEEPING OUT
   THE BACKGROUND OF THE KID

1822
01:28:15,555 --> 01:28:18,425
  WHEN HE TESTIFIES, SO THE JURY
  DOESN'T HAVE ALL THE EGGS,

1823
01:28:18,525 --> 01:28:20,627
  BUT NOW THEY'RE
  KEEPING OUT THE COUNSELOR,

1824
01:28:20,728 --> 01:28:22,563
   WHO EVEN
   KNOWS ABOUT THIS KID,

1825
01:28:22,662 --> 01:28:24,865
  WHO TOLD HIM THE STORY
  IN THE FIRST PLACE,

1826
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:26,968
PRIOR TO HIM
EVER TELLING THE POLICE.

1827
01:28:27,068 --> 01:28:29,470
 ALL THAT GOES
 TO THE CREDIBILITY.

1828
01:28:29,569 --> 01:28:31,639
I THINK THAT WOULD'VE SHOWN
THE JURY THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE

1829
01:28:31,738 --> 01:28:33,440
QUITE THAT KIND HEART.

1830
01:28:33,541 --> 01:28:35,877
THAT SOFT HEART.

1831
01:28:45,953 --> 01:28:48,556
   ( prosecutor )
   DET. ALLEN, I WANT TO
   DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION

1832
01:28:48,655 --> 01:28:51,658
 TO NOVEMBER
 THE 17TH, 1993,

1833
01:28:51,759 --> 01:28:53,860
   WERE YOU ASKED TO

1834
01:28:53,961 --> 01:28:55,930
  MAKE CONTACT WITH SOME

1835
01:28:56,029 --> 01:28:58,832
PROPERTY OWNERS AT
LAKESHORE TRAILER PARK,

1836
01:28:58,932 --> 01:29:00,734
  AND ALSO GET WITH

1837
01:29:00,835 --> 01:29:02,837
THE ARKANSAS
STATE POLICE DIVE TEAM ?

1838
01:29:02,936 --> 01:29:04,771
( Allen )
YES, SIR I WAS.

1839
01:29:04,872 --> 01:29:07,842
  AND AFTER
  A PERIOD OF TIME OF...

1840
01:29:10,511 --> 01:29:11,846
SEARCHING,

1841
01:29:11,945 --> 01:29:14,247
  DO YOU KNOW WHETHER
  ANY ITEMS WERE RECOVERED ?

1842
01:29:14,948 --> 01:29:15,750
  YES, SIR.

1843
01:29:16,750 --> 01:29:18,485
MARK FOR
IDENTIFICATION PURPOSES,

1844
01:29:18,586 --> 01:29:20,454
 THE STATE'S EXHIBIT 77,

1845
01:29:20,555 --> 01:29:22,557
 AND I ASK IF YOU
 CAN IDENTIFY THAT.

1846
01:29:31,030 --> 01:29:31,932
YES,

1847
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:34,268
 I CAN IDENTIFY THIS
 BY MY...

1848
01:29:37,604 --> 01:29:39,574
 "11-17 OF '93,

1849
01:29:39,673 --> 01:29:41,943
 M. ALLEN",
 THAT I PUT HERE.

1850
01:29:42,042 --> 01:29:43,777
 ( prosecutor )
 WHERE DID YOU
 GET THE KNIFE ?

1851
01:29:43,877 --> 01:29:45,512
( Allen )
I GOT THIS KNIFE FROM

1852
01:29:45,613 --> 01:29:47,749
THE DIVER
WITH THE STATE POLICE.

1853
01:29:47,849 --> 01:29:49,684
  HOW LONG DID
  THIS SEARCH TAKE ?

1854
01:29:49,783 --> 01:29:51,085
"HOW LONG ?"

1855
01:29:52,418 --> 01:29:55,355
FROM MEMORY, I'M THINKING,
MAYBE 10:30 A.M.

1856
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:58,826
IS THE TIME THEY GOT SUITED UP
AND STARTED TO LOOK.

1857
01:29:58,926 --> 01:30:01,429
  YOU QUIT AT WHEN ?

1858
01:30:01,529 --> 01:30:03,631
THEY LOCATED THE...

1859
01:30:04,832 --> 01:30:05,900
KNIFE,

1860
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,902
AT 11:35 A.M.

1861
01:30:08,002 --> 01:30:10,905
11:30, 11:35.

1862
01:30:11,005 --> 01:30:13,574
  ABOUT AN HOUR.

1863
01:30:13,673 --> 01:30:15,109
ABOUT AN HOUR--

1864
01:30:15,208 --> 01:30:16,877
  ARE YOU TELLING THIS JURY

1865
01:30:16,978 --> 01:30:19,113
THAT THIS KNIFE
IS THE MURDER WEAPON ?

1866
01:30:19,212 --> 01:30:20,514
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE TELLIN' THIS JURY ?

1867
01:30:20,614 --> 01:30:22,516
 NO, SIR, I'M NOT
 TELLING THE JURY THAT.

1868
01:30:22,617 --> 01:30:24,652
OKAY, NOW THAT
WE UNDERSTAND THAT.

1869
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:27,622
WHAT DAY WERE THESE
INDIVIDUALS CHARGED ?

1870
01:30:27,721 --> 01:30:29,556
  WHAT DID DAY DID
  Y'ALL CHARGE DAMIEN ECHOLS

1871
01:30:29,657 --> 01:30:31,225
  WITH THIS CRIME ?

1872
01:30:31,324 --> 01:30:32,626
WAS IT JUNE
THE THIRD ?

1873
01:30:32,726 --> 01:30:33,860
YES, SIR.

1874
01:30:33,961 --> 01:30:35,730
 AND WHAT DAY WAS IT
 THAT YOU WERE OUT THERE

1875
01:30:35,829 --> 01:30:37,532
  SEARCHING THIS LAKE ?

1876
01:30:37,631 --> 01:30:40,500
THIS WAS ON
11-17 OF '93.

1877
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:42,903
   NOVEMBER 17 OF 1993 ?

1878
01:30:43,003 --> 01:30:43,503
YES, SIR.

1879
01:30:43,604 --> 01:30:44,271
 THAT'S ALL.

1880
01:30:47,306 --> 01:30:50,177
  AS LONG AS THEY GET AN ARREST,
  THEY DON'T CARE.

1881
01:30:51,011 --> 01:30:53,214
THE DAMN SYSTEM STINKS !

1882
01:30:56,617 --> 01:30:58,586
THEY'RE PLAYING
WITH OUR LIVES,

1883
01:30:58,685 --> 01:31:00,387
AND THERE'S NOTHING
RIGHT ABOUT IT.

1884
01:31:00,488 --> 01:31:02,657
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
THE NAZI'S,

1885
01:31:02,756 --> 01:31:04,558
THEY CAN JUST TAKE
SOMEBODY'S WORD

1886
01:31:04,658 --> 01:31:06,893
AND COME IN YOUR HOUSE,
AND TAKE YOU AWAY.

1887
01:31:08,561 --> 01:31:10,698
AND BASICALLY
THAT'S WHAT THEY DID

1888
01:31:10,797 --> 01:31:12,934
BECAUSE OF WHAT
JESSIE TOLD THEM,

1889
01:31:13,033 --> 01:31:15,469
EVEN THOUGH IT HAD ALL THOSE
INCONSISTENCIES IN IT.

1890
01:31:15,569 --> 01:31:17,404
IF WE HAD MONEY,
DO YOU THINK THESE 3 BOYS

1891
01:31:17,505 --> 01:31:19,407
WOULD'VE BEEN PICKED UP ?

1892
01:31:19,506 --> 01:31:21,842
THEY FOUND PEOPLE
THEY KNEW DIDN'T HAVE NE

1893
01:31:21,943 --> 01:31:23,945
THE BOYS HAVE BEEN IN
A LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE,

1894
01:31:24,045 --> 01:31:25,813
THEY THOUGHT
WE DIDN'T CARE,

1895
01:31:25,912 --> 01:31:27,481
THEY WERE WRONG.

1896
01:31:27,582 --> 01:31:29,884
THEY'RE<i> BAD</i> WRONG.

1897
01:31:29,984 --> 01:31:31,886
I DON'T BELIEVE
THAT CHILDREN

1898
01:31:31,985 --> 01:31:34,020
COULD BE

1899
01:31:34,121 --> 01:31:35,789
THAT COLD-BLOODED,

1900
01:31:35,890 --> 01:31:37,625
AS WHAT HAPPENED
TO THOSE BOYS.

1901
01:31:38,725 --> 01:31:40,795
   ( man )
   ON THE STATE'S EXHIBIT, 67-A,

1902
01:31:40,895 --> 01:31:42,597
  IT SHOWS THE...

1903
01:31:42,697 --> 01:31:44,832
  HOG-TYING FASHION,

1904
01:31:44,931 --> 01:31:47,100
THE HANDS WERE HOG-TIED,

1905
01:31:47,201 --> 01:31:49,537
TO THE FEET,
BEHIND THE BACK,

1906
01:31:49,636 --> 01:31:52,038
 AND THIS IS THE PHOTOGRAPH,

1907
01:31:52,139 --> 01:31:54,809
   SHOWING THE SHOE LACES...

1908
01:31:56,743 --> 01:31:59,080
( man )
THAT INJURY, YOU SAY,

1909
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:01,449
IS TYPICAL OF A BELT INJURY,

1910
01:32:01,548 --> 01:32:03,751
THE BELT HAS
A LITTLE BUCKLE,

1911
01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:06,987
AND THAT'S ONE
THAT GOES BACK AND FORTH

1912
01:32:07,087 --> 01:32:10,090
   LEFT TO RIGHT,
   THAT'S THE BASE OF THE LATCH.

1913
01:32:10,856 --> 01:32:13,027
HERE, THIS
RED AREA HERE,

1914
01:32:13,127 --> 01:32:16,097
THIS IS THE
SHAFT OF THE PENIS,

1915
01:32:16,197 --> 01:32:18,032
AND HERE IS WHERE
THE SCROTAL SAC

1916
01:32:18,131 --> 01:32:20,467
AND TESTES SHOULD BE
AND THEY'RE MISSING.

1917
01:32:20,568 --> 01:32:23,170
SO WHAT WE HAVE
IS THE SKIN OVERLYING THE PENIS,

1918
01:32:23,270 --> 01:32:24,805
THE HEAD OF THE PENIS,

1919
01:32:24,904 --> 01:32:26,873
HAS BEEN CARVED OFF,
IT'S GONE, IT'S NOT THERE.

1920
01:32:28,207 --> 01:32:29,543
( defense )
IN LAYMAN'S LANGUAGE,

1921
01:32:29,644 --> 01:32:31,445
THAT I UNDERSTAND,

1922
01:32:31,545 --> 01:32:33,814
WITH RESPECT,

1923
01:32:33,913 --> 01:32:36,951
HIS PENIS HAS NOT
BEEN CUT OFF, HAS IT ?

1924
01:32:37,051 --> 01:32:40,154
   NO, THE SKIN HAS BEEN
   TAKEN OFF THE PENIS.

1925
01:32:40,253 --> 01:32:43,090
  AND BASICALLY IT WOULD
  TAKE SOME SKILL

1926
01:32:43,189 --> 01:32:44,858
   AND PRECISION

1927
01:32:44,958 --> 01:32:46,594
   TO DO THAT,
   WOULDN'T IT ?

1928
01:32:46,694 --> 01:32:48,829
I WOULD THINK SO.

1929
01:32:48,929 --> 01:32:50,498
IF THIS WAS
TO BE DONE,

1930
01:32:50,597 --> 01:32:52,600
THIS DISSECTION,

1931
01:32:52,699 --> 01:32:54,868
  WHERE THE SKIN IS CUT OFF,

1932
01:32:54,969 --> 01:32:57,137
 THAT WOULD TAKE
 A VERY SHARP INSTRUMENT

1933
01:32:57,238 --> 01:32:58,838
 WOULD IT NOT ?

1934
01:32:58,939 --> 01:33:00,975
   I THINK IT WOULD.

1935
01:33:01,074 --> 01:33:02,876
SUCH AS A RAZOR.

1936
01:33:02,976 --> 01:33:04,045
   OR A SHARP KNIFE.

1937
01:33:04,145 --> 01:33:05,379
A VERY SHARP KNIFE,

1938
01:33:05,479 --> 01:33:07,882
DOCTOR, IF YOU
WERE TO DO THIS,

1939
01:33:07,981 --> 01:33:10,585
WITH THE SKILL AND PRECISION
AND KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU TAKE,

1940
01:33:10,685 --> 01:33:12,853
HOW LONG WOULD IT
TAKE YOU TO DO THAT ?

1941
01:33:12,953 --> 01:33:14,822
  ( doctor )
  IT WOULD
  TAKE ME SOME TIME.

1942
01:33:14,921 --> 01:33:16,923
( defense )
IT WOULD TAKE YOU LONGER
THAN 5 TO 10 MINUTES ?

1943
01:33:17,024 --> 01:33:18,492
   I WOULD THINK SO.

1944
01:33:18,591 --> 01:33:20,360
AND THAT'S
IN YOUR LAB.

1945
01:33:20,461 --> 01:33:22,163
   I WOULD THINK SO.

1946
01:33:22,262 --> 01:33:23,863
WITH A SCALPEL.

1947
01:33:23,963 --> 01:33:25,231
IS THAT CORRECT ?

1948
01:33:25,332 --> 01:33:26,400
 THAT'S CORRECT.

1949
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:28,603
NOW, DOCTOR IF WE
ADDED TO THE EQUATION

1950
01:33:28,703 --> 01:33:30,705
THAT YOU WERE IN THE DARK,

1951
01:33:30,805 --> 01:33:33,173
COULD YOU DO THIS
IN THE DARK ?

1952
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:36,110
YOU, DOCTOR, COULD<i> YOU</i>
DO IT IN THE DARK ?

1953
01:33:36,210 --> 01:33:38,145
  ( doctor )
  IT'D BE DIFFICULT.

1954
01:33:38,244 --> 01:33:40,614
COULD YOU DO THIS
IN THE WATER ?

1955
01:33:40,715 --> 01:33:44,251
YOU, DOCTOR, COULD YOU
DO THIS IN THE WATER ?

1956
01:33:45,719 --> 01:33:48,221
   I THINK IT WOULD BE
   VERY DIFFICULT TO DO.

1957
01:33:48,322 --> 01:33:50,123
   IF YOU WERE DOING IT
   IN THE DARK,

1958
01:33:50,224 --> 01:33:51,958
   IN THE WATER,

1959
01:33:52,059 --> 01:33:55,162
   WITH MOSQUITOES
   ALL AROUND YOU.

1960
01:33:56,296 --> 01:33:58,865
 WOULD THAT MAKE IT EVEN<i>
 MUCH</i> MORE DIFFICULT ?

1961
01:33:58,966 --> 01:34:00,935
I WOULD THINK SO.

1962
01:34:01,034 --> 01:34:04,070
IT WOULD BE
A VERY TEDIOUS TASK FOR<i> YOU,</i>

1963
01:34:04,171 --> 01:34:07,008
A SKILLED PATHOLOGIST.

1964
01:34:07,108 --> 01:34:09,010
   IT WOULD.

1965
01:34:09,109 --> 01:34:11,612
NOW, ISN'T
IT TRUE, DOCTOR,

1966
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:14,649
THAT PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT
5 PINTS OF BLOOD ?

1967
01:34:14,748 --> 01:34:16,951
 A LITTLE MORE
 THAN THAT, YES.

1968
01:34:17,051 --> 01:34:18,886
OKAY, NOW,

1969
01:34:18,985 --> 01:34:21,021
IF I POURED OUT
FIVE PINTS OF BLOOD

1970
01:34:21,122 --> 01:34:22,690
OUT HERE
ON ON THE FLOOR,

1971
01:34:22,789 --> 01:34:24,557
IT WOULD MAKE A BIG MESS,
WOULDN'T IT ?

1972
01:34:24,658 --> 01:34:26,160
   YES.

1973
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:28,829
AND IT WOULD BE
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CLEAN UP.

1974
01:34:28,929 --> 01:34:30,797
  YOU CAN DO IT BUT,

1975
01:34:30,898 --> 01:34:34,135
  NOT VERY EASILY.

1976
01:34:34,768 --> 01:34:36,703
 IT'S NOT EASY
 TO CLEAN BLOOD.

1977
01:34:36,804 --> 01:34:38,806
DOES BLOOD
SOAK INTO THE GROUND ?

1978
01:34:38,905 --> 01:34:40,608
   YES, IT DOES.

1979
01:34:40,707 --> 01:34:42,777
 ( defense )
 DOCTOR, WITH THIS HOMICIDE,

1980
01:34:42,877 --> 01:34:44,879
   WE'RE TALKING
   ABOUT HERE TODAY,

1981
01:34:44,979 --> 01:34:47,114
 WOULD YOU
 AGREE WITH ME THAT,

1982
01:34:47,213 --> 01:34:49,984
  THIS COULD'VE HAPPENED
  IN ONE OF THREE WAYS,

1983
01:34:50,083 --> 01:34:52,485
 THESE INJURIES
 COULD'VE HAPPENED IN THE WATER,

1984
01:34:52,586 --> 01:34:54,655
  THESE INJURES
  COULD'VE HAPPENED ON THE BANK,

1985
01:34:54,755 --> 01:34:57,091
OR COULD'VE HAPPENED
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

1986
01:34:57,190 --> 01:34:59,025
WOULD YOU AGREE WITH ME THOSE
ARE THE THREE POSSIBILITIES

1987
01:34:59,126 --> 01:35:00,761
OF HOW THIS
COULD'VE HAPPENED ?

1988
01:35:00,860 --> 01:35:02,229
   YES.

1989
01:35:02,328 --> 01:35:04,798
NOW, WITH YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE
AMOUNT OF BLOOD THAT WAS LOST,

1990
01:35:04,899 --> 01:35:07,735
FROM, NOT ONLY CHRIS BYERS,
BUT THESE OTHER BOYS,

1991
01:35:07,835 --> 01:35:10,104
THEY'RE GONNA BLEED
AS WELL, WON'T THEY ?

1992
01:35:10,203 --> 01:35:12,072
OH, YES.

1993
01:35:12,172 --> 01:35:14,108
DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION
AS TO WHETHER OR NOT

1994
01:35:14,207 --> 01:35:16,810
YOU COULD CLEAN UP
THAT AMOUNT OF BLOOD ?

1995
01:35:16,911 --> 01:35:18,813
   AT A SCENE,
   IN THE DARK ?

1996
01:35:18,912 --> 01:35:20,613
DO YOU HAVE AN
OPINION AS TO THAT ?

1997
01:35:20,713 --> 01:35:22,615
I THINK IT WOULD BE
QUITE DIFFICULT TO DO,

1998
01:35:22,716 --> 01:35:23,851
TO HAVE...

1999
01:35:25,752 --> 01:35:27,488
INJURIES OF THIS NATURE,

2000
01:35:27,587 --> 01:35:30,157
WITHOUT HAVING ANY BLOOD...

2001
01:35:31,824 --> 01:35:34,127
I WOULD QUESTION THAT
ABOUT THE BLOOD.

2002
01:35:34,828 --> 01:35:36,530
UNLESS IT HAPPENED
IN THE WATER

2003
01:35:36,630 --> 01:35:38,632
OR IT HAPPENED
SOME OTHER PLACE.

2004
01:35:38,731 --> 01:35:40,967
( defense )
AND YOU AGAIN, DOCTOR,
STATED THAT YOU COULDN'T

2005
01:35:41,068 --> 01:35:42,869
DO THIS
IN THE WATER ?

2006
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:45,271
  PERSONALLY,
  I DON'T THINK I COULD.

2007
01:35:47,073 --> 01:35:49,810
I DON'T GET OFF
ON HURTIN' PEOPLE,

2008
01:35:49,909 --> 01:35:52,212
OR INFLICTING PAIN

2009
01:35:52,313 --> 01:35:54,648
ON THE REST
OF THE HUMAN RACE,

2010
01:35:54,747 --> 01:35:55,782
OR JUST...

2011
01:35:56,582 --> 01:35:59,652
CAUSING DESTRUCTION
FOR THE PURPOSE OF DESTRUCTION.

2012
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:03,590
I'VE PROBABLY BEEN IN

2013
01:36:03,690 --> 01:36:06,059
ONE OR TWO FIGHTS
MY ENTIRE LIFE.

2014
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,636
AND ESPECIALLY A CHILD...

2015
01:36:19,939 --> 01:36:22,009
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING TO DESERVE

2016
01:36:22,109 --> 01:36:23,978
WHAT THEY GOT.

2017
01:36:37,791 --> 01:36:40,628
AND I BELIEVE WHATEVER YOU DO
TO SOMEONE ELSE,

2018
01:36:40,728 --> 01:36:43,197
WHETHER IT'S GOOD OR BAD,

2019
01:36:43,296 --> 01:36:45,565
IS EVENTUALLY GONNA
COME BACK AROUND TO<i> YOU.</i>

2020
01:36:49,469 --> 01:36:51,471
EVEN THE PERSON
WHO DID THIS,

2021
01:36:51,572 --> 01:36:53,606
IF THEY'RE NOT
CAUGHT AND PUNISHED,

2022
01:36:53,707 --> 01:36:55,709
SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN
IN THEIR LIFE

2023
01:36:55,809 --> 01:36:58,112
WHERE THEY
WILL BE PUNISHED.

2024
01:37:01,881 --> 01:37:04,484
( girl )
PEOPLE KEPT TELLIN' ME
NOT TO GO OUT WITH DAMIEN

2025
01:37:04,585 --> 01:37:07,154
BECAUSE HE WAS LIKE
SOME KIND OF DEVIL WORSHIPER,

2026
01:37:07,253 --> 01:37:10,024
AND I MET HIM
IN<i> WAL-MART...</i>

2027
01:37:11,690 --> 01:37:14,561
AND HE FOLLOWED ME AROUND
LIKE A PUPPY DOG...

2028
01:37:17,029 --> 01:37:19,599
AND WE STARTED TALKING
AND HE WAS REAL SWEET,

2029
01:37:19,699 --> 01:37:22,001
NOT LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE WAS
MAKING HIM OUT TO BE,

2030
01:37:22,101 --> 01:37:23,703
THAT NIGHT WE
STARTING GOING OUT,

2031
01:37:23,804 --> 01:37:25,840
AND IT WAS LIKE A MONTH,

2032
01:37:25,939 --> 01:37:27,841
AND HE CALLED ME UP
ON THE TELEPHONE

2033
01:37:27,942 --> 01:37:29,976
AT MY DAD'S
GIRLFRIEND'S HOUSE

2034
01:37:30,077 --> 01:37:31,979
AND HE GOES,
"WILL YOU MARRY ME ?"

2035
01:37:32,078 --> 01:37:33,746
AND I'M LIKE, "WHAT ?!"

2036
01:37:33,846 --> 01:37:35,815
AND HE GOES,
"WILL YOU MARRY ME ?"

2037
01:37:35,916 --> 01:37:38,586
I SAID, "CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
ONE MORE TIME ?!"

2038
01:37:38,685 --> 01:37:40,554
AND HE GOES,
"WILL YOU MARRY ME",

2039
01:37:40,654 --> 01:37:42,556
I SAID, "YEAH",

2040
01:37:42,655 --> 01:37:44,992
AND WHEN I GOT PREGNANT

2041
01:37:45,091 --> 01:37:47,193
I HAD THIS BIG PICTURE
PAINTED IN MY MIND,

2042
01:37:47,293 --> 01:37:48,996
DAMIEN'S GONNA BE THERE,

2043
01:37:49,095 --> 01:37:52,065
AND I GET TO YELL AT HIM
WHEN I HAVE THE BABY.

2044
01:37:53,766 --> 01:37:56,871
AND INSTEAD
I WAS YELLING AT<i> HER.</i>

2045
01:37:57,938 --> 01:37:59,539
I MISS HIM SO MUCH.

2046
01:38:05,945 --> 01:38:08,047
AND HE HASN'T YET
TO SEE THE BABY,

2047
01:38:08,148 --> 01:38:10,251
 THEY WON'T LET HIM<i>
 TOUCH</i> THE BABY.

2048
01:38:12,886 --> 01:38:15,189
IT MAKES ME SO PISSED OFF.

2049
01:38:15,956 --> 01:38:19,126
I FELT DIFFERENT
WHEN HE WAS BORN IT WAS--

2050
01:38:23,162 --> 01:38:25,131
IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE,

2051
01:38:25,231 --> 01:38:27,835
I GUESS JUST
REAL GOOD INSIDE...

2052
01:38:30,136 --> 01:38:31,772
TO THINK THAT I GAVE LIFE

2053
01:38:31,872 --> 01:38:33,539
TO ANOTHER HUMAN BEING.

2054
01:38:35,007 --> 01:38:37,478
SOMETHING COMPLETELY
SEPARATE FROM ME

2055
01:38:37,578 --> 01:38:39,580
BUT STILL PART OF ME.

2056
01:38:48,054 --> 01:38:51,024
I JUST HOPE THAT I'LL BE THERE
WHEN HE GROWS UP.

2057
01:38:51,125 --> 01:38:52,725
TO WATCH HIM.

2058
01:38:53,393 --> 01:38:55,663
 ( prosecutor )
 YOU ARE FAMILIAR
 WITH A FELLOW NAMED

2059
01:38:55,762 --> 01:38:57,363
 <i> ALEISTER CROWLEY</i> ?

2060
01:38:57,463 --> 01:39:00,033
I KNOW WHO HE IS.

2061
01:39:01,568 --> 01:39:03,704
   HE'S THE GUY
   WHO KINDLY PROFESSES,

2062
01:39:03,804 --> 01:39:06,373
 HE'S A NOTED AUTHOR

2063
01:39:06,472 --> 01:39:08,509
 IN THE FIELD
 OF SATANIC WORSHIP.

2064
01:39:08,609 --> 01:39:10,511
I KNOW HE IS

2065
01:39:10,610 --> 01:39:12,813
   BUT I NEVER SAW
   ANY OF HIS BOOKS, PERSONALLY.

2066
01:39:12,912 --> 01:39:15,315
YOU'RE NOT REALLY MUCH
OF A FOLLOWER OF HIS ?

2067
01:39:15,416 --> 01:39:17,484
  I WOULD'VE READ 'EM
  IF I WOULD'VE SAW 'EM,

2068
01:39:17,583 --> 01:39:19,819
BUT, I JUST NEVER...

2069
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:21,788
BUT, ALEISTER CROWLEY,

2070
01:39:21,889 --> 01:39:24,591
  IS A GUY THAT
  BASED ON HIS WRITINGS,

2071
01:39:24,690 --> 01:39:27,161
BELIEVES IN HUMAN SACRIFICE,
DOESN'T HE ?

2072
01:39:27,926 --> 01:39:30,697
 HE ALSO BELIEVED
 HE WAS GOD, THOUGH.

2073
01:39:31,898 --> 01:39:34,467
AND HE ALSO

2074
01:39:34,568 --> 01:39:36,936
HAD WRITINGS
THAT INDICATED

2075
01:39:37,037 --> 01:39:39,006
THAT CHILDREN
WERE THE BEST TYPE

2076
01:39:39,105 --> 01:39:40,873
OF HUMAN SACRIFICE,
CORRECT ?

2077
01:39:40,974 --> 01:39:42,576
  YES, SIR.

2078
01:39:42,676 --> 01:39:45,145
  ( prosecutor )
  BUT, ALEISTER CROWLEY
  DOESN'T HAVE ANY

2079
01:39:45,244 --> 01:39:47,180
   PARTICULAR
   SIGNIFICANCE TO YOU ?

2080
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:48,815
I KNOW WHO HE IS,

2081
01:39:48,916 --> 01:39:50,751
I'VE READ
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HIM,

2082
01:39:50,850 --> 01:39:52,752
BUT, I NEVER READ
ANYTHING<i> BY</i> HIM.

2083
01:39:53,819 --> 01:39:55,488
LET ME SHOW YOU

2084
01:39:55,588 --> 01:39:58,125
A COPY OF DOCUMENTS,

2085
01:39:58,225 --> 01:40:00,027
DO YOU RECOGNIZE THAT ?

2086
01:40:00,127 --> 01:40:00,928
 YES.

2087
01:40:01,761 --> 01:40:03,230
WHAT IS THAT ?

2088
01:40:05,497 --> 01:40:08,468
 IT WAS THIS PAPER I HAD
 ON DIFFERENT ALPHABETS

2089
01:40:08,569 --> 01:40:11,038
 FOR LIKE TRANSLATIONS,

2090
01:40:11,137 --> 01:40:12,972
  WHERE YOU CAN WRITE THINGS
  THAT NOBODY COULD READ,

2091
01:40:13,073 --> 01:40:14,675
  AND THIS WAS
  ONE OF THE FORMS.

2092
01:40:14,774 --> 01:40:15,942
  OH, OKAY,

2093
01:40:16,042 --> 01:40:17,443
  WHERE'D YOU
  HAVE THAT AT ?

2094
01:40:17,543 --> 01:40:20,713
WHEN DID YOU
WRITE THOSE THINGS OUT ?

2095
01:40:21,747 --> 01:40:24,617
SOME TIME BEFORE
I WAS ARRESTED I GUESS.

2096
01:40:24,717 --> 01:40:26,854
   ARE YOU SURE THAT
   YOU HADN'T DONE THOSE

2097
01:40:26,953 --> 01:40:29,222
   SINCE YOU WERE ARRESTED WHILE
   YOU BEEN STAYING IN JAIL ?

2098
01:40:29,323 --> 01:40:30,824
  I DON'T KNOW,
  I MIGHT HAVE.

2099
01:40:31,858 --> 01:40:34,994
 ( prosecutor )
 WHO'S NAMES ARE WRITTEN
 ON THAT DOCUMENT ?

2100
01:40:35,895 --> 01:40:37,531
 MINE, JASON'S,

2101
01:40:37,631 --> 01:40:39,600
 MY SON'S,

2102
01:40:39,699 --> 01:40:41,635
 ONE THAT SAYS
 ALEISTER CROWLEY--

2103
01:40:41,734 --> 01:40:42,935
WAIT, WAIT !
WHO ?

2104
01:40:43,036 --> 01:40:44,570
   ALEISTER CROWLEY.

2105
01:40:44,671 --> 01:40:47,007
  THIS IS A DOCUMENT THAT YOU'VE
   WRITTEN WHILE YOU'VE BEEN

2106
01:40:47,106 --> 01:40:49,243
  WAITING IN JAIL
  FOR TRIAL, RIGHT ?

2107
01:40:49,342 --> 01:40:51,211
  IF YOU SAY SO.

2108
01:40:51,310 --> 01:40:53,012
 YOU WROTE IT,
 IT'S YOUR WRITING ?

2109
01:40:53,113 --> 01:40:54,948
 MM-HMM.

2110
01:40:55,047 --> 01:40:57,016
 DO YOU RECALL
 WHEN YOU WROTE IT ?

2111
01:40:57,117 --> 01:40:58,519
   NOT REALLY.

2112
01:40:58,618 --> 01:41:00,487
WHAT I'M GONNA ASK YOU IS,

2113
01:41:00,587 --> 01:41:02,890
THAT THIS DAMIEN ECHOLS,
YOUR SON,

2114
01:41:02,989 --> 01:41:05,559
HE WASN'T BORN UNTIL AFTER YOU
WERE PLACED IN JAIL, CORRECT ?

2115
01:41:05,658 --> 01:41:06,926
 YES.

2116
01:41:07,027 --> 01:41:09,663
SO IF YOU'VE GOT HIS NAME
LISTED ON THIS DOCUMENT,

2117
01:41:09,762 --> 01:41:12,666
THEN THIS DOCUMENT HAD TO BE
GENERATED AFTER HE WAS BORN ?

2118
01:41:12,765 --> 01:41:13,966
YES.

2119
01:41:14,067 --> 01:41:15,769
SO THIS IS SOMETHING
YOU'VE WRITTEN

2120
01:41:15,868 --> 01:41:17,537
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN
SITTING IN HERE IN JAIL

2121
01:41:17,637 --> 01:41:19,338
WAITING FOR TRIAL.

2122
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:20,606
 YES.

2123
01:41:20,707 --> 01:41:23,043
AND WHAT YOU WERE DOING
WAS WRITING OUT VARIOUS NAMES

2124
01:41:23,143 --> 01:41:24,877
IN DIFFERENT TYPES
OF ALPHABETS, CORRECT ?

2125
01:41:24,978 --> 01:41:26,712
  FROM THE WAY IT LOOKS HERE
  I WAS PRACTICING,

2126
01:41:26,813 --> 01:41:28,748
TRYING TO
MEMORIZE THEM.

2127
01:41:28,849 --> 01:41:31,118
AND ONE OF THE NAMES THAT YOU
PICKED OUT TO WRITE ABOUT

2128
01:41:31,217 --> 01:41:33,686
WAS THIS FELLA NAMED
ALEISTER CROWELY, CORRECT ?

2129
01:41:33,787 --> 01:41:34,855
MM-HMM.

2130
01:41:34,954 --> 01:41:37,157
IS THAT JUST
A TOTAL COINCIDENCE,

2131
01:41:37,256 --> 01:41:39,125
YOU JUST PULLED HIS NAME
OUT OF THE AIR ?

2132
01:41:39,225 --> 01:41:41,627
 NO, IT'S THE SAME BOOK
 THAT I HAD

2133
01:41:41,728 --> 01:41:43,931
WITH THE DIFFERENT ALPHABETS

2134
01:41:44,030 --> 01:41:46,199
   AND IT ALSO HAD STUFF
   ABOUT HIM IN THERE.

2135
01:41:47,533 --> 01:41:50,570
DID YOU HAVE THE BOOK OUT AT
THE TIME YOU WERE DOING THIS ?

2136
01:41:50,671 --> 01:41:53,006
 THIS WAS JUST FROM WHAT
 I REMEMBERED MYSELF,

2137
01:41:53,105 --> 01:41:54,675
I WAS PRACTICING,
TRYING TO MEMORIZE,

2138
01:41:54,774 --> 01:41:56,476
  GET IT ALL IN MY HEAD.

2139
01:41:56,577 --> 01:41:58,545
SO YOU WERE GOING OVER IT
AND WORKING ON IT,

2140
01:41:58,645 --> 01:42:00,814
AND AT THAT POINT IN TIME,

2141
01:42:00,913 --> 01:42:04,318
YOU WRITE ALL THIS
DOWN FROM MEMORY ?

2142
01:42:04,817 --> 01:42:05,985
 MM-HMM.

2143
01:42:06,086 --> 01:42:07,855
( prosecutor )
THE PEOPLE
THAT ARE LISTED HERE,

2144
01:42:07,954 --> 01:42:09,590
YOU GOT YOUR NAME
ON HERE, RIGHT ?

2145
01:42:09,689 --> 01:42:11,224
  ( Damien )
  MM-HMM.

2146
01:42:11,324 --> 01:42:14,027
( prosecutor )
AND JASON BALDWIN, WHICH IS
YOUR BEST FRIEND, RIGHT ?

2147
01:42:14,127 --> 01:42:15,996
AND THEN YOU GOT
DAMIEN SETH ECHOLS,

2148
01:42:16,095 --> 01:42:17,897
THAT'S YOUR SON ?

2149
01:42:17,997 --> 01:42:19,532
 ( Damien )
 YES, IT IS.

2150
01:42:19,632 --> 01:42:21,969
( prosecutor )
AND THE ONLY OTHER NAME
ON THIS DOCUMENT,

2151
01:42:22,069 --> 01:42:24,805
BESIDES YOURSELF,
YOUR BEST FRIEND, AND YOUR SON,

2152
01:42:24,904 --> 01:42:26,539
IS ALEISTER CROWLEY,
CORRECT ?

2153
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:28,642
 YES, SIR.

2154
01:42:28,742 --> 01:42:30,644
  ( judge )
  I BELIEVE THIS WITNESS HAS

2155
01:42:30,743 --> 01:42:32,411
 REQUESTED NOT
 TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED.

2156
01:42:32,511 --> 01:42:34,480
THAT'S CORRECT,
YOUR HONOR.

2157
01:42:43,555 --> 01:42:46,159
   WOULD YOU STATE YOUR NAME
   FOR THE JURY ?

2158
01:42:46,260 --> 01:42:48,061
CHRISTI VANBICKLE.

2159
01:42:48,161 --> 01:42:49,796
DO LIKE YOU JUST DID

2160
01:42:49,895 --> 01:42:52,865
AND SPEAK UP
BEST YOU CAN, OKAY ?

2161
01:42:53,932 --> 01:42:55,435
   ARE YOU NERVOUS ?

2162
01:42:55,534 --> 01:42:57,537
( Christi )
YES.

2163
01:42:58,503 --> 01:43:00,974
   DID YOU HEAR SOMEBODY
   SAY SOMETHING

2164
01:43:01,073 --> 01:43:02,742
  ABOUT THE MURDER
  OF THE THREE LITTLE BOYS ?

2165
01:43:02,842 --> 01:43:05,077
( Christi )
YES, I HEARD DAMIEN ECHOLS SAY

2166
01:43:05,177 --> 01:43:07,146
THAT HE KILLED
THE THREE BOYS.

2167
01:43:07,247 --> 01:43:09,716
  ( prosecutor )
  WHERE WERE YOU,
  WAS HE SAYIN' THAT TO YOU,

2168
01:43:09,815 --> 01:43:11,585
   WHAT WERE YOU DOIN' ?

2169
01:43:11,685 --> 01:43:13,620
( Christi )
I WAS WALKING BY
WITH MY FRIEND.

2170
01:43:20,926 --> 01:43:22,695
 CHRISTI,
 I'M SCOTT DAVIDSON,

2171
01:43:22,796 --> 01:43:25,065
  I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS
  TO ASK YOU TOO, OKAY ?

2172
01:43:25,164 --> 01:43:28,100
 FIRST OF ALL, DO YOU
 REMEMBER WHAT DAY THIS WAS

2173
01:43:28,201 --> 01:43:30,069
   THAT YOU HEARD THIS ?

2174
01:43:30,170 --> 01:43:31,872
NO, SIR.

2175
01:43:31,971 --> 01:43:34,041
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME YOU'D
EVER SEEN HIM IN YOUR LIFE ?

2176
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:35,641
( Christi )
YES, SIR.

2177
01:43:35,742 --> 01:43:38,045
 ( defense )
  WHAT DID HE SAY
 <i> BEFORE</i> HE SAID

2178
01:43:38,145 --> 01:43:39,880
   HE KILLED
   THOSE THREE BOYS,

2179
01:43:39,979 --> 01:43:41,647
   WHAT DID HE
   SAY BEFORE THAT ?

2180
01:43:41,747 --> 01:43:43,482
( Christi )
I DON'T KNOW.

2181
01:43:43,582 --> 01:43:45,751
( defense )
WHAT DID HE
SAY AFTER THAT ?

2182
01:43:45,851 --> 01:43:47,720
( Christi )
I DON'T KNOW.

2183
01:43:47,820 --> 01:43:49,890
( defense )
AND HOW CLOSE
WERE YOU TO HIM ?

2184
01:43:49,989 --> 01:43:51,557
( Christi )
I WASN'T CLOSE.

2185
01:43:51,658 --> 01:43:53,493
  ( defense )
  DID HE SCREAM IT ?

2186
01:43:53,592 --> 01:43:55,127
( Christi )
I DON'T KNOW.

2187
01:43:55,228 --> 01:43:55,929
( defense )
DID HE YELL IT ?

2188
01:43:56,029 --> 01:43:57,531
( Christi )
I DON'T KNOW.

2189
01:43:59,332 --> 01:44:01,268
( prosecutor )
CALL JODY MEDFORD.

2190
01:44:01,368 --> 01:44:02,536
( judge )
AGAIN, THIS WITNESS

2191
01:44:02,636 --> 01:44:04,805
HAS REQUESTED
NOT TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED.

2192
01:44:05,837 --> 01:44:08,641
JODY, I WANT TO
DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO

2193
01:44:08,742 --> 01:44:11,712
   MAY OF 1993,
   AFTER THE MURDERS

2194
01:44:11,811 --> 01:44:13,846
   OF THE THREE LITTLE BOYS.

2195
01:44:13,947 --> 01:44:16,984
DID YOU HAVE OCCASION
TO BE AT THE SOFTBALL FIELD

2196
01:44:17,083 --> 01:44:20,119
  AND HEAR A COMMENT
  IN REGARD TO THE MURDERS ?

2197
01:44:20,220 --> 01:44:21,454
YES, SIR.

2198
01:44:22,622 --> 01:44:24,524
TELL THE JURY FIRST,

2199
01:44:24,623 --> 01:44:26,827
 WHAT YOU HEARD.

2200
01:44:26,926 --> 01:44:29,195
( Jody )
HE SAID
"I KILLED THE LITTLE BOYS

2201
01:44:29,296 --> 01:44:31,632
"AND BEFORE I TURN MYSELF IN
I'M GONNA KILL TWO MORE,

2202
01:44:31,731 --> 01:44:34,635
AND I ALREADY HAVE
ONE OF 'EM PICKED OUT."

2203
01:44:34,734 --> 01:44:37,237
( prosecutor )
YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE ANYBODY
ELSE THAT WAS WITH HIM ?

2204
01:44:37,337 --> 01:44:39,139
( Jody )
I SAW JASON BALDWIN THERE.

2205
01:44:40,305 --> 01:44:42,942
HAD YOU HEARD PEOPLE TALKING
ABOUT DAMIEN BEFORE THIS ?

2206
01:44:43,042 --> 01:44:44,277
YES, SIR.

2207
01:44:45,744 --> 01:44:47,713
  DID YOU THINK,

2208
01:44:47,814 --> 01:44:50,350
DO YOU THINK HE WAS
KIND OF WEIRD OR SOMETHING ?

2209
01:44:50,449 --> 01:44:52,818
YES, SIR 'CAUSE HE WAS
DRESSED ALL IN BLACK

2210
01:44:52,918 --> 01:44:54,820
AND HIS HAIR WAS
JET BLACK AND LONG

2211
01:44:54,921 --> 01:44:57,090
AND SHAVED ON THE SIDE.

2212
01:44:57,856 --> 01:45:00,661
( reporter )
TWO TEEN-AGE GIRLS
TOOK THE STAND THIS MORNING

2213
01:45:00,761 --> 01:45:02,596
AND THEY SAID THEY HEARD
DAMIEN ECHOLS

2214
01:45:02,695 --> 01:45:05,564
CONFESS TO THE MURDERS OF THREE
8 YEAR OLD BOYS LAST MAY,

2215
01:45:05,664 --> 01:45:08,234
ONE OF THE GIRLS SAID
SHE OVERHEARD DAMIEN ECHOLS SAY,

2216
01:45:08,335 --> 01:45:10,537
"I KILLED THE THREE BOYS,
AND I'M GOING TO KILL TWO MORE,

2217
01:45:10,636 --> 01:45:12,738
I ALREADY HAVE
ONE PICKED OUT."

2218
01:45:12,838 --> 01:45:14,675
LATER IN THE AFTERNOON,

2219
01:45:14,774 --> 01:45:16,676
WHEN THE DEFENSE BEGAN
PRESENTING IT'S WITNESSES,

2220
01:45:16,777 --> 01:45:18,578
DAMIEN ECHOLS, HIMSELF
TOOK THE STAND,

2221
01:45:18,677 --> 01:45:20,680
HE SAID HE THOUGHT
THE GIRLS WERE LYING

2222
01:45:20,780 --> 01:45:22,615
AND THAT THEY WERE
MAKING UP THOSE STATEMENTS.

2223
01:45:22,716 --> 01:45:24,584
HE ALSO SAID HE DID NOT
PRACTICE SATANISM,

2224
01:45:24,684 --> 01:45:27,220
AND DENIED ANY INVOLVEMENT
IN THE MURDERS OF CHRIS BYERS,

2225
01:45:27,319 --> 01:45:29,456
MICHAEL MOORE
AND STEVIE BRANCH.

2226
01:45:38,264 --> 01:45:41,034
WERE YOU WORKING
AT BOJANGLES RESTAURANT

2227
01:45:41,134 --> 01:45:43,603
  ON THE EVENING OF MAY 5TH

2228
01:45:43,703 --> 01:45:45,472
OF 1993 ?

2229
01:45:45,572 --> 01:45:46,806
YES, SIR.

2230
01:45:46,907 --> 01:45:48,842
   COULD YOU TELL US
   WHAT HAPPENED ?

2231
01:45:48,942 --> 01:45:51,043
WELL, IT WAS ABOUT
9:30 AT NIGHT,

2232
01:45:51,144 --> 01:45:54,181
I FOUND A BLACK GENTLMAN SITTING
IN THE IN THE WOMAN'S RESTROOM

2233
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:55,716
ON THE COMMODE,

2234
01:45:55,815 --> 01:45:57,951
AND THERE WAS BLOOD
DRIPPING OFF OF HIS FOREARM,

2235
01:45:58,051 --> 01:46:00,187
BUT, HE HAD
MUD ON HIS FEET,

2236
01:46:00,287 --> 01:46:01,954
AND HE SEEMED TO BE

2237
01:46:02,055 --> 01:46:03,856
DISARRAYED WHEN
I TALKED TO HIM.

2238
01:46:03,957 --> 01:46:05,759
I CALLED THE POLICE THEN.

2239
01:46:05,859 --> 01:46:07,694
( defense )
WHAT HAPPENED THEN ?

2240
01:46:07,793 --> 01:46:10,497
( man )
IT WAS A FEMALE OFFICER
FOR THE WEST MEMPHIS POLICE,

2241
01:46:10,596 --> 01:46:12,865
AND SHE PULLED ON THE LOT
AND I SAW HER COMING

2242
01:46:12,966 --> 01:46:14,868
SO, I WENT UP
TO THE FRONT DOOR.

2243
01:46:14,967 --> 01:46:18,137
SHE KEPT COMIN' AROUND, SHE WENT
TO THE DRIVE THROUGH WINDOW.

2244
01:46:18,238 --> 01:46:20,606
  ( defense )
  YOU DID NOT
  GO IN THE RESTAURANT ?

2245
01:46:20,707 --> 01:46:22,509
NO, SIR, I DID NOT.

2246
01:46:22,609 --> 01:46:24,644
  DID YOU EVER FIND THIS
  BLEEDING BLACK MAN ?

2247
01:46:24,743 --> 01:46:26,011
NO, SIR, I DID NOT.

2248
01:46:26,112 --> 01:46:29,082
DO YOU HAVE A REPORT THAT YOU
MADE REGARDING THIS INCIDENT ?

2249
01:46:29,181 --> 01:46:31,016
   NO, SIR,
   I DO NOT.

2250
01:46:31,117 --> 01:46:32,753
AND YOU'RE OUT
LOOKING FOR SOME BOYS,

2251
01:46:32,853 --> 01:46:35,521
YOU'RE OUT IN THAT AREA AND
YOU HEAR ABOUT SOMEONE BLEEDING,

2252
01:46:35,622 --> 01:46:37,524
DID ANYTHING GO
THROUGH YOUR MIND THINKING,

2253
01:46:37,623 --> 01:46:39,992
  SOMETHING MAY BE GOING ON ?

2254
01:46:40,092 --> 01:46:41,761
YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND,
IT'S A DIFFERENT AREA I WENT TO,

2255
01:46:41,862 --> 01:46:43,497
IT WAS A DIFFERENT WARD,

2256
01:46:43,596 --> 01:46:46,065
   I DID NOT CONNECT
   THE TWO AT ALL.

2257
01:46:46,166 --> 01:46:48,668
 ( defense )
 IT MAY HAVE BEEN
 OUTSIDE YOUR WARD,

2258
01:46:48,768 --> 01:46:51,471
 BUT, DISTANCE-WISE BETWEEN
 THE AREA WHERE YOU WERE LOOKING

2259
01:46:51,570 --> 01:46:53,038
  AND WHERE THIS RESTAURANT WAS,

2260
01:46:53,139 --> 01:46:54,440
  IT'S NOT A
  LONG DISTANCE, IS IT ?

2261
01:46:54,541 --> 01:46:57,177
  NO, SIR,
  IT'S REALLY NOT.

2262
01:46:58,010 --> 01:47:00,614
   ( defense )
   DID ANY OTHER OFFICER
   COME OUT THERE THAT EVENING ?

2263
01:47:00,713 --> 01:47:03,015
 NOT THAT EVENING.

2264
01:47:03,115 --> 01:47:06,252
WERE YOU WORKING ON
THE DAY OF MAY 6TH OF 1993 ?

2265
01:47:06,353 --> 01:47:07,654
YES, SIR,

2266
01:47:07,753 --> 01:47:09,523
TWO DETECTIVES CAME OUT

2267
01:47:09,622 --> 01:47:11,657
AND THEY TOOK A REPORT
AS FAR AS WHAT I'D SEEN,

2268
01:47:11,757 --> 01:47:13,793
DESCRIPTION OF
THE GENTLEMAN,

2269
01:47:13,894 --> 01:47:16,829
AND THEN THEY TOOK
BLOOD SCRAPINGS OFF THE WALL.

2270
01:47:16,930 --> 01:47:19,900
WHAT IS THE DATE THAT
YOU SENT THE BLOOD SCRAPINGS

2271
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,368
OFF TO THE CRIME LAB
TO BE ANALYZED ?

2272
01:47:22,469 --> 01:47:24,337
THEY WERE
NEVER SENT.

2273
01:47:24,436 --> 01:47:25,771
THEY WERE
NEVER SENT ?

2274
01:47:25,872 --> 01:47:27,374
 THAT'S CORRECT.

2275
01:47:27,474 --> 01:47:29,708
WHERE ARE THE BLOOD SAMPLES
AT THIS TIME ?

2276
01:47:29,809 --> 01:47:31,811
   I DON'T KNOW,
   THEY'RE LOST.

2277
01:47:31,912 --> 01:47:35,015
 THAT'S MY MISTAKE,
 I LOST A PIECE OF EVIDENCE.

2278
01:47:46,492 --> 01:47:49,563
( Damien )
MOST OF THE TIME HE CAME UP
WITH THE STUPID IDEAS.

2279
01:47:52,198 --> 01:47:53,900
I GUESS I INFLUENCED HIM

2280
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,837
ABOUT AS MUCH
AS HE INFLUENCED ME.

2281
01:47:56,936 --> 01:47:58,604
MOST OF THE TIME
WE DIDN'T REALLY,

2282
01:47:58,704 --> 01:48:00,539
SET OUT TO DO
ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR.

2283
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:02,609
WE JUST STARTING
HANGING AROUND,

2284
01:48:02,708 --> 01:48:05,644
WHATEVER HAPPENED
JUST USUALLY HAPPENED.

2285
01:48:07,846 --> 01:48:10,082
SOMETIMES GOOD,
SOMETIMES BAD.

2286
01:48:11,149 --> 01:48:12,685
WE'RE JUST SITTING
ON THE COUCH WATCHING TV

2287
01:48:12,786 --> 01:48:14,621
THE NIGHT
WE WERE ARRESTED.

2288
01:48:19,057 --> 01:48:20,726
PIGS BUSTED IN,

2289
01:48:20,827 --> 01:48:22,963
STARTING RUNNIN'
ALL OVER THE HOUSE.

2290
01:48:23,063 --> 01:48:25,131
WE TRIED TO HIDE IN THE BEDROOM
WHEN THE COPS FIRST CAME.

2291
01:48:25,230 --> 01:48:26,966
THEY WOULDN'T LEAVE !

2292
01:48:27,067 --> 01:48:28,734
WE WERE IN THE BEDROOM,
TURNED THE LIGHT OFF,

2293
01:48:28,835 --> 01:48:31,104
MAYBE THEY'LL GO AWAY.

2294
01:48:31,203 --> 01:48:33,172
 I KNOW YOU'RE
 IN THERE, OPEN UP !

2295
01:48:34,840 --> 01:48:36,643
WE SAW ALL
THE LIGHTS GO OUT.

2296
01:48:38,243 --> 01:48:40,012
 AND DOMINI
 TURNED 'EM BACK ON.

2297
01:48:40,113 --> 01:48:41,981
NO, IT WAS
MY SISTER.

2298
01:49:00,498 --> 01:49:03,603
 ( man )
 THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT
 IT IS THE ONE KNIFE,

2299
01:49:03,703 --> 01:49:05,472
  THAT WE KNOW SOMEBODY OWNS

2300
01:49:05,572 --> 01:49:07,740
IS THE BYERS' KNIFE.

2301
01:49:07,841 --> 01:49:09,609
 WE KNOW HE OWNS THAT KNIFE.

2302
01:49:09,708 --> 01:49:11,510
HE'S GOT THE MOTIVE,

2303
01:49:11,610 --> 01:49:13,512
 HIS SON WHO
 HE'S UPSET WITH,

2304
01:49:13,613 --> 01:49:15,682
 HIS SON WAS
 THE ONLY ONE MUTILATED,

2305
01:49:15,782 --> 01:49:17,583
  THE OTHER TWO
  WEREN'T MUTILATED,

2306
01:49:17,684 --> 01:49:20,420
  HE'S GOT KNOWLEDGE
  ABOUT THE AREA,

2307
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:22,923
HE KNOWS WHEN
THE SEARCH IS OVER WITH,

2308
01:49:23,023 --> 01:49:25,958
 HE'S BIG ENOUGH THAT HE CAN
 CARRY THE BOYS THERE

2309
01:49:26,059 --> 01:49:27,661
  AND THROW THEM IN,

2310
01:49:27,761 --> 01:49:29,596
  HE'S A JEWELER,

2311
01:49:29,695 --> 01:49:32,298
 HE'S PRECISE ENOUGH TO HAVE

2312
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:34,601
 COMMITTED THAT MUTILATION,

2313
01:49:34,701 --> 01:49:37,436
   ALL OF THE PIECES
   FIT TOGETHER

2314
01:49:37,537 --> 01:49:40,039
   WITH SOMEBODY IN
   A DIFFERENT LOCATION,

2315
01:49:40,140 --> 01:49:42,876
KILLING THE BOYS
IN A DIFFERENT LOCATION,

2316
01:49:42,975 --> 01:49:45,744
  BECAUSE THERE'S NO
  MOSQUITO BITES ON 'EM,

2317
01:49:45,845 --> 01:49:48,648
   SO WE KNOW THAT AFTER
   THE BOYS WERE KILLED,

2318
01:49:48,747 --> 01:49:50,583
   AND DURING,

2319
01:49:50,684 --> 01:49:52,886
   THEY WEREN'T OUTSIDE.

2320
01:49:52,985 --> 01:49:55,555
THEY HAD TO BE INSIDE 'CAUSE
THERE'S NO BITES ON 'EM.

2321
01:49:55,654 --> 01:49:59,192
 SO THAT MEANS THEY WERE CARRIED
 FROM A DEATH SCENE SOMEPLACE,

2322
01:49:59,292 --> 01:50:00,360
  UNCONSCIOUS,

2323
01:50:00,460 --> 01:50:01,860
  AND BROUGHT DOWN
  TO THE RIVER,

2324
01:50:01,961 --> 01:50:03,797
   AND THEY HAD TO BE KILLED

2325
01:50:03,896 --> 01:50:05,765
SHORTLY BEFORE THEY WERE
BROUGHT DOWN THERE,

2326
01:50:05,864 --> 01:50:08,201
BECAUSE THEY ALL DIED WITHIN
A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

2327
01:50:08,301 --> 01:50:10,103
  SO AFTER THEY WERE
  BLED TO DEATH,

2328
01:50:10,203 --> 01:50:11,838
 AFTER THEY WERE BLUDGEONED,

2329
01:50:11,938 --> 01:50:13,606
   AND UNCONSCIOUS,

2330
01:50:13,707 --> 01:50:15,642
   SOMEBODY HAD TO
   TAKE THOSE THREE,

2331
01:50:15,742 --> 01:50:18,144
  TAKE 'EM TO THE SCENE,
  AND DUMP 'EM.

2332
01:50:18,243 --> 01:50:19,912
  IN ORDER TO DO THAT,

2333
01:50:20,012 --> 01:50:21,814
 YOU GOTTA BE
PHYSICALLY STRONG ENOUGH

2334
01:50:21,914 --> 01:50:23,649
   TO CARRY

2335
01:50:23,750 --> 01:50:25,851
   AN UNCONSCIOUS KID...

2336
01:50:25,952 --> 01:50:28,088
   WHO'S HOG-TIED.

2337
01:50:28,953 --> 01:50:30,689
JASON COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT,

2338
01:50:30,789 --> 01:50:32,591
   IN HIS BEST DAY,

2339
01:50:32,692 --> 01:50:34,461
HE COULDN'T
CARRY A LITTLE BABY,

2340
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:36,528
 WITH THOSE LITTLE
 SKINNY ARMS OF HIS.

2341
01:50:36,628 --> 01:50:38,430
SO WHEN WE LOOK
AT THIS WHOLE THING,

2342
01:50:38,530 --> 01:50:41,635
 ALL THE PIECES THAT
 THEY TRIED TO PUT TOGETHER,

2343
01:50:41,734 --> 01:50:44,136
 NONE OF IT
 FITS WITH JASON

2344
01:50:44,237 --> 01:50:46,806
 AND JUST ABOUT
 ALL OF IT FITS

2345
01:50:46,905 --> 01:50:49,708
TOWARDS A PERSON
LIKE BYERS.

2346
01:50:49,809 --> 01:50:52,412
( prosecutor )
WHEN DID YOU
RECEIVE THAT KNIFE ?

2347
01:50:52,511 --> 01:50:55,114
I BELIEVE IT WAS
ON THE 8TH,

2348
01:50:55,215 --> 01:50:57,617
I'VE GOT--
IT'S HARD TO MAKE THIS OUT,

2349
01:50:57,716 --> 01:50:59,752
"JANUARY THE 8TH, 1994."

2350
01:50:59,853 --> 01:51:01,954
   ALRIGHT, AND,

2351
01:51:02,055 --> 01:51:05,225
 WHO DID YOU RECEIVE
 THIS KNIFE FROM ?

2352
01:51:05,324 --> 01:51:07,226
I RECEIVED IT FROM...

2353
01:51:10,162 --> 01:51:12,097
HOW DID I
ACTUALLY RECEIVE IT ?

2354
01:51:12,198 --> 01:51:13,767
NO, WHO DID YOU
RECEIVE THE KNIFE FROM ?

2355
01:51:13,867 --> 01:51:16,302
I RECEIVED IT FROM...

2356
01:51:17,470 --> 01:51:19,472
JOE AND THE PEOPLE

2357
01:51:19,572 --> 01:51:22,242
WITH<i> HBO PRODUCTIONS.</i>

2358
01:51:22,341 --> 01:51:22,708
O.K.

2359
01:51:23,708 --> 01:51:25,511
BRUCE AND...

2360
01:51:25,612 --> 01:51:27,514
 WHEREVER HE IS.

2361
01:51:27,613 --> 01:51:30,015
  UPON RECEIVING THAT KNIFE,
  WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT ?

2362
01:51:30,115 --> 01:51:32,185
( man )
I SAW WHAT
I THOUGHT TO BE

2363
01:51:32,284 --> 01:51:34,354
SOME TYPE OF SUBSTANCE
ON THE KNIFE,

2364
01:51:34,453 --> 01:51:36,755
AND NATURALLY I DID NOT
KNOW WHAT IT WAS,

2365
01:51:36,855 --> 01:51:38,490
I, IN TURN,

2366
01:51:38,591 --> 01:51:40,927
SENT THIS KNIFE
TO GENETIC DESIGN.

2367
01:51:41,027 --> 01:51:43,529
  WHEN THE KNIFE
  WAS RECEIVED BY YOUR FIRM,

2368
01:51:43,630 --> 01:51:46,166
DID YOU OR YOUR LAB,

2369
01:51:46,265 --> 01:51:48,567
  RUN TESTS ON THAT
  PARTICULAR KNIFE ?

2370
01:51:48,667 --> 01:51:51,737
THERE WAS A SMALL AMOUNT OF
WHAT APPEARED TO BE

2371
01:51:51,837 --> 01:51:54,273
BLOOD THAT WAS DRIED,

2372
01:51:54,373 --> 01:51:57,210
OR TISSUE IN A CREVICE
ON THE KNIFE,

2373
01:51:57,310 --> 01:51:59,179
WHERE THE KNIFE
FOLDS WHEN IT LOCKS.

2374
01:51:59,279 --> 01:52:01,147
 THE RESULTS OF THE TEST
 SHOWED US THAT

2375
01:52:01,247 --> 01:52:03,083
 THERE WAS<i> DNA</i>

2376
01:52:03,182 --> 01:52:05,217
   PRESENT ON THE KNIFE,

2377
01:52:05,318 --> 01:52:08,121
   AND THAT WE WERE ABLE
   TO GET A TYPE,

2378
01:52:08,220 --> 01:52:09,788
 USING A TEST CALLED

2379
01:52:09,889 --> 01:52:12,025
 "HLA-DQ ALPHA".

2380
01:52:12,125 --> 01:52:15,127
 AND MR. BYERS HAD THE SAME TYPE
 THAT WAS DETECTED

2381
01:52:15,228 --> 01:52:17,797
   FROM THE SPECIMEN
   FROM THE KNIFE.

2382
01:52:17,896 --> 01:52:20,934
OKAY, AND WHAT WAS
THE "DQ-ALPHA" TYPE

2383
01:52:21,033 --> 01:52:22,868
FOR CHRISTOPHER BYERS ?

2384
01:52:22,969 --> 01:52:24,871
 IT WAS ALSO
 THE SAME TYPE.

2385
01:52:24,970 --> 01:52:27,706
SO, THE BLOOD
ON THE KNIFE,

2386
01:52:27,806 --> 01:52:30,809
AND CHRISTOPHER BYER'S BLOOD,

2387
01:52:30,909 --> 01:52:33,179
AND JOHN MARK BYER'S BLOOD

2388
01:52:33,279 --> 01:52:34,614
ALL HAD THE SAME TYPE.

2389
01:52:34,713 --> 01:52:35,614
   CORRECT.

2390
01:52:50,229 --> 01:52:52,065
( defense )
JUDGE, IF I CAN
APPROACH THE WITNESS ?

2391
01:52:52,164 --> 01:52:54,033
( judge )
ALRIGHT.

2392
01:52:54,132 --> 01:52:56,168
TAKE A LOOK
AT THAT KNIFE.

2393
01:53:02,675 --> 01:53:04,844
I WILL CALL THAT,
FOR IDENTIFICATION PURPOSES,

2394
01:53:04,944 --> 01:53:08,148
   THE "JOHN MARK BYERS' KNIFE".

2395
01:53:08,913 --> 01:53:11,951
   DOCTOR, DID YOU MAKE
   A COMPARISON WITH THIS KNIFE,

2396
01:53:12,051 --> 01:53:13,987
  "E-6",

2397
01:53:14,087 --> 01:53:16,589
 AND COMPARE THAT
 WITH SOME OF THE WOUNDS

2398
01:53:16,689 --> 01:53:18,458
THAT YOU FOUND
ON CHRIS BYERS ?

2399
01:53:18,557 --> 01:53:20,493
  YES, I DID.

2400
01:53:20,592 --> 01:53:22,662
DOES THAT KNIFE APPEAR
TO BE A SERRATED KNIFE ?

2401
01:53:22,761 --> 01:53:24,630
   YES, THIS IS
   A SERRATED KNIFE.

2402
01:53:24,730 --> 01:53:26,498
  DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION

2403
01:53:26,599 --> 01:53:28,802
   IF SOME OF THE WOUNDS
   THAT YOU FOUND ON CHRIS BYERS

2404
01:53:28,902 --> 01:53:31,538
 WERE CONSISTENT WITH WOUNDS
 WHICH WOULD'VE BEEN CAUSED

2405
01:53:31,637 --> 01:53:33,972
 BY THAT TYPE
 OF SERRATED KNIFE ?

2406
01:53:34,073 --> 01:53:35,675
SOME OF THE WOUNDS
THAT HAVE

2407
01:53:35,774 --> 01:53:37,710
THE SMALLER
SERRATED PATTERNS,

2408
01:53:37,810 --> 01:53:39,846
COULD HAVE BEEN

2409
01:53:39,945 --> 01:53:42,015
INFLICTED WITH A KNIFE

2410
01:53:42,114 --> 01:53:44,617
HAVING THIS TYPE
OF SERRATION.

2411
01:53:44,716 --> 01:53:47,519
   ( man )
   HOW DO YOU THINK
   THIS HAS GONE OVER SO FAR

2412
01:53:47,619 --> 01:53:49,956
ON THE
MARK BYERS' ASPECT ?

2413
01:53:50,055 --> 01:53:51,790
( man )
OBVIOUSLY WE THOUGHT
LONG AND HARD

2414
01:53:51,890 --> 01:53:53,559
ABOUT MENTIONING A FATHER

2415
01:53:53,659 --> 01:53:56,028
AS A POSSIBLE SUSPECT.

2416
01:53:56,128 --> 01:53:58,463
   ( man )
   I HATE HAVING
   TO DO THAT,

2417
01:53:58,564 --> 01:54:00,567
  BUT THE WAY
  THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE,

2418
01:54:00,667 --> 01:54:04,037
   IT'S JUST COMING OUT
   WHETHER WE WANT IT TO OR NOT.

2419
01:54:05,337 --> 01:54:08,141
WE HAD SUSPICIONS EVEN
BEFORE THE KNIFE SHOWED UP.

2420
01:54:08,240 --> 01:54:10,542
( man )
DO YOU THINK ANYBODY
REALIZES THE REASON

2421
01:54:10,643 --> 01:54:13,645
FOR THE THREE DAY DELAY
IN JESSIE'S TRIAL WAS

2422
01:54:13,746 --> 01:54:16,615
WAITING ON THAT DNA TEST

2423
01:54:16,716 --> 01:54:18,985
TO COME BACK
ON BYERS' KNIFE ?

2424
01:54:19,085 --> 01:54:21,654
( man )
I DOUBT IT, AND EVEN
AFTER THE RESULTS CAME BACK,

2425
01:54:21,753 --> 01:54:24,157
AND IT SHOWED THAT
IT COULD BE MARK'S BLOOD,

2426
01:54:24,256 --> 01:54:25,824
AS WELL AS CHRIS' BLOOD,

2427
01:54:25,925 --> 01:54:27,827
THAT DOESN'T ALLEVIATE

2428
01:54:27,926 --> 01:54:30,028
THE FACT THAT HE SAID

2429
01:54:30,128 --> 01:54:32,532
NO ONE HAD EVER
CUT THEMSELF ON THE KNIFE.

2430
01:54:33,832 --> 01:54:36,236
AND IT SHOULDN'T HAVE
HAD BLOOD ON IT AT ALL.

2431
01:54:36,336 --> 01:54:38,637
DO YOU THINK
THE ARGUMENT AT LEAST

2432
01:54:38,738 --> 01:54:42,108
THAT IT WASN'T THAT THE BLOOD
WAS FOUND ON THE BLADE,

2433
01:54:42,207 --> 01:54:44,076
WHICH COULD BE
EASILY WIPED OFF,

2434
01:54:44,176 --> 01:54:46,578
BUT IT WAS BACK IN THE HINGES
THAT YOU NORMALLY WOULDN'T THINK

2435
01:54:46,679 --> 01:54:48,914
IF YOU WERE WIPIN'
OFF THE BLOOD,

2436
01:54:49,015 --> 01:54:51,150
YOU WOULDN'T THINK THE BLOOD
WOULD BE INSIDE THE HINGES,

2437
01:54:51,250 --> 01:54:52,784
AND THAT'S WHERE THEY FOUND
THAT PARTICULAR BLOOD.

2438
01:54:52,885 --> 01:54:54,554
   HOW DO WE
   GET THAT IN ?

2439
01:54:54,654 --> 01:54:56,522
 JUST ASK GITCHELL ?

2440
01:54:56,622 --> 01:54:59,225
ASK BYERS, WE CAN PUT
BYERS UP ON THE STAND.

2441
01:54:59,324 --> 01:55:01,260
 ( man )
 I THINK THE JURY
 EXPECTS TO SEE HIM NOW.

2442
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:03,528
 THEY WANNA SEE
 WHAT HE HAS TO SAY,

2443
01:55:03,628 --> 01:55:04,963
DON'T YOU THINK SO ?

2444
01:55:05,064 --> 01:55:05,664
  I THINK SO.

2445
01:55:06,698 --> 01:55:09,001
MR. BYERS,
I NEED TO ASK YOU ABOUT,

2446
01:55:09,101 --> 01:55:11,104
DEFENSE EXHIBIT
NUMBER "E-6",

2447
01:55:11,203 --> 01:55:12,639
   THIS PARTICULAR

2448
01:55:12,738 --> 01:55:15,240
   FOLDING LOCK-BLADE KNIFE.

2449
01:55:15,940 --> 01:55:17,577
  IF I CAN APPROACH
  THE WITNESS YOUR HONOR ?

2450
01:55:17,676 --> 01:55:19,112
  ( judge )
  YES.

2451
01:55:20,179 --> 01:55:22,081
TAKE A LOOK AT
THAT KNIFE, PLEASE.

2452
01:55:31,122 --> 01:55:33,259
  HAD THAT KNIFE
  EVER BEEN USED BEFORE ?

2453
01:55:34,893 --> 01:55:36,930
  USED FOR WHAT ?

2454
01:55:37,029 --> 01:55:39,064
  USED FOR ANY PURPOSE ?

2455
01:55:40,064 --> 01:55:41,934
I HAD...

2456
01:55:42,034 --> 01:55:43,936
 TRIMMED ME
 TOENAILS WITH IT,

2457
01:55:44,037 --> 01:55:45,771
 I HAD ATTEMPTED TO

2458
01:55:45,872 --> 01:55:47,707
 TRIM ON

2459
01:55:47,806 --> 01:55:49,908
 SOME VENISON THAT I HAD.

2460
01:55:50,908 --> 01:55:53,011
  YOU ATTEMPTED
  "TO TRIM ON SOME VENISON",

2461
01:55:53,112 --> 01:55:55,614
  WHEN WAS IT THAT YOU ATTEMPTED
  TO TRIM ON SOME VENISON ?

2462
01:55:55,715 --> 01:55:59,252
SOME TIME AROUND
THE THANKSGIVING HOLIDAYS.

2463
01:55:59,351 --> 01:56:01,554
   DO YOU RECALL BEING ASKED
   ON JANUARY THE 26TH,

2464
01:56:01,654 --> 01:56:03,589
 THIS IS ON PAGE 3,

2465
01:56:03,689 --> 01:56:05,658
 BY INSP. GITCHELL,

2466
01:56:05,757 --> 01:56:07,659
 "HAD YOU EVER TAKEN
 THAT KNIFE HUNTING,

2467
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:10,195
  OR USED IT RECENTLY ?"

2468
01:56:10,296 --> 01:56:12,865
 DO YOU REMEMBER BEING ASKED
 THAT QUESTION BY GITCHELL ?

2469
01:56:12,965 --> 01:56:15,635
SPECIFICALLY, NO, SIR,
HE ASKED ME A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

2470
01:56:15,734 --> 01:56:18,603
 DO YOU REMEMBER
 GIVING THE ANSWER "NO,

2471
01:56:18,703 --> 01:56:21,506
 "THAT KNIFE HAD NOT
 BEEN USED AT ALL,

2472
01:56:21,606 --> 01:56:24,676
  "IT HAD JUST BEEN KEPT UP,
  PUT IN MY DRESSER,

2473
01:56:24,777 --> 01:56:26,746
  "AND I DIDN'T USE IT,

2474
01:56:26,845 --> 01:56:30,148
  AND THE REASON WHY WAS BECAUSE
  OF THE SERRATED EDGES."

2475
01:56:30,248 --> 01:56:32,050
  DO YOU RECALL
  GIVING THAT ANSWER

2476
01:56:32,150 --> 01:56:34,787
 TO GITCHELL
 ON THE 26TH ?

2477
01:56:36,087 --> 01:56:37,789
NO, SIR,
I DON'T RECALL

2478
01:56:37,890 --> 01:56:39,859
GIVING HIM
THAT EXACT ANSWER.

2479
01:56:39,958 --> 01:56:42,127
I'M SURE HIS QUESTION
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ASKED

2480
01:56:42,228 --> 01:56:43,997
EXACTLY LIKE YOUR QUESTION.

2481
01:56:44,096 --> 01:56:45,597
  DID GITCHELL TELL YOU,

2482
01:56:45,698 --> 01:56:47,834
"LET ME EXPLAIN
A PROBLEM WE HAD,

2483
01:56:47,934 --> 01:56:50,003
 "AND YOU NEED TO ANSWER
 THIS FROM ME,

2484
01:56:50,103 --> 01:56:52,070
   WE HAVE FOUND
   BLOOD ON THIS KNIFE",

2485
01:56:52,171 --> 01:56:54,507
DID GITCHELL ASK YOU
THAT QUESTION ?

2486
01:56:54,606 --> 01:56:57,243
I DON'T REMEMBER IF HE SAID
THERE WAS OR NOT.

2487
01:56:57,342 --> 01:56:59,144
   DID YOU TELL GITCHELL
   YOU HAD NO IDEA

2488
01:56:59,244 --> 01:57:01,180
HOW CHRIS' BLOOD
COULD BE ON THAT KNIFE ?

2489
01:57:01,279 --> 01:57:03,448
( Byers )
YES, SIR, I WOULD NOT
HAVE ANY IDEA,

2490
01:57:03,548 --> 01:57:05,618
IF HIS BLOOD
WAS ON THAT KNIFE,

2491
01:57:05,717 --> 01:57:07,819
I WOULD NOT KNOW
HOW IT GOT THERE.

2492
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:09,355
   DID YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

2493
01:57:09,454 --> 01:57:11,858
   HOW HUMAN BLOOD
   WAS ON THAT KNIFE ?

2494
01:57:11,957 --> 01:57:13,692
YES, I WOULD HAVE AN IDEA,

2495
01:57:13,792 --> 01:57:15,927
I CUT MY THUMB.

2496
01:57:16,028 --> 01:57:17,530
   ALRIGHT,

2497
01:57:17,630 --> 01:57:21,067
ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOU
NEVER TOLD GITCHELL ON JAN. 26TH

2498
01:57:21,167 --> 01:57:24,003
THAT YOU EVER CUT YOUR THUMB
WITH THAT PARTICULAR KNIFE,

2499
01:57:24,103 --> 01:57:25,238
   DID YOU ?

2500
01:57:25,337 --> 01:57:27,739
YES, SIR, IT SEEMS LIKE
DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY

2501
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:29,175
I DID TELL HIM THAT.

2502
01:57:29,274 --> 01:57:31,643
WAS THAT DURING THE TAPED
CONVERSATION OR WAS THAT AFTER ?

2503
01:57:31,743 --> 01:57:33,979
I DON'T REMEMBER.

2504
01:57:34,079 --> 01:57:36,015
OKAY, ON THE TOP
OF PAGE 8,

2505
01:57:36,114 --> 01:57:38,117
   DO YOU RECALL
   BEING ASKED THE QUESTION,

2506
01:57:38,216 --> 01:57:40,920
"I HAVE NO IDEA,
NO IDEA,

2507
01:57:41,020 --> 01:57:42,622
  "HOW IT COULD HAVE

2508
01:57:42,721 --> 01:57:44,756
 ANY HUMAN BLOOD ON IT",

2509
01:57:44,856 --> 01:57:46,591
DO YOU RECALL
GIVING THAT ANSWER ?

2510
01:57:46,692 --> 01:57:47,627
YES, SIR.

2511
01:57:47,726 --> 01:57:49,494
 THEN DO YOU RECALL STATING,

2512
01:57:49,595 --> 01:57:51,963
 "I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER
 NICKING MYSELF WITH IT,

2513
01:57:52,064 --> 01:57:53,865
   CUTTING THE DEER MEAT
   OR<i> ANYTHING."</i>

2514
01:57:53,966 --> 01:57:55,468
  IS THAT THE ANSWER
  YOU GAVE ?

2515
01:57:55,568 --> 01:57:56,636
YES, SIR.

2516
01:57:56,735 --> 01:57:58,537
 AND IS THAT THE TRUTH ?

2517
01:57:58,637 --> 01:58:00,907
AT THE TIME WHEN
HE WAS QUESTIONING ME,

2518
01:58:01,006 --> 01:58:03,576
I MIGHT NOT HAVE REMEMBERED,

2519
01:58:03,676 --> 01:58:07,113
WE WERE GETTING READY
TO GO INTO A TRIAL...

2520
01:58:09,014 --> 01:58:10,949
DID YOU REMEMBER
ON THIS DATE

2521
01:58:11,050 --> 01:58:12,784
   CUTTING YOURSELF
   WITH THE VENISON,

2522
01:58:12,885 --> 01:58:14,987
  OR NOT
  CUTTING YOURSELF ?

2523
01:58:15,087 --> 01:58:17,090
THE DATE THAT
GARY QUESTIONED--

2524
01:58:17,189 --> 01:58:18,190
   YES, SIR.

2525
01:58:18,291 --> 01:58:20,460
I MIGHT NOT HAVE
REMEMBERED IT AT THAT TIME,

2526
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:22,462
WHEN HE WAS
QUESTIONING ME,

2527
01:58:22,561 --> 01:58:24,663
BUT, I COULD HAVE REMEMBERED IT
LATER ON IN THE DAY

2528
01:58:24,764 --> 01:58:27,233
AND TALKED TO HIM
ABOUT IT.

2529
01:58:28,367 --> 01:58:30,436
 EARLIER THAT AFTERNOON,

2530
01:58:30,536 --> 01:58:32,637
  HAD YOU GIVEN
  CHRIS A WHIPPING ?

2531
01:58:32,738 --> 01:58:35,675
  APPROXIMATELY AROUND 5:30.

2532
01:58:35,774 --> 01:58:38,344
ABOUT 5:30,
WAS THIS WITH A BELT ?

2533
01:58:38,444 --> 01:58:40,113
 YES, SIR.

2534
01:58:40,212 --> 01:58:42,715
HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU
HIT HIM WITH THE BELT ?

2535
01:58:42,814 --> 01:58:45,150
   I SPANKED HIM
   TWO OR THREE TIMES.

2536
01:58:45,251 --> 01:58:48,087
AND WHAT PART OF THE BODY
DID YOU SPANK HIM ?

2537
01:58:48,186 --> 01:58:50,823
 IT WOULD'VE BEEN
 JUST ON HIS BEHIND.

2538
01:58:50,922 --> 01:58:52,992
  WAS HE WEARING HIS PAINTS,

2539
01:58:53,091 --> 01:58:54,493
   OR DID YOU HAVE HIM
   PULL HIS PANTS DOWN ?

2540
01:58:54,594 --> 01:58:56,929
   NO, HE HAD ON
   BLUE JEANS.

2541
01:59:00,899 --> 01:59:02,835
THE JUDGE BACK THERE
DURING THAT LAST RECESS

2542
01:59:02,935 --> 01:59:04,704
BEFORE YOU WERE
RECALLED HERE,

2543
01:59:04,804 --> 01:59:06,939
SAYS THAT YOU HAVE
A BRAIN TUMOR

2544
01:59:07,038 --> 01:59:08,541
AND YOU'RE BEING TREATED,

2545
01:59:08,640 --> 01:59:10,942
DO YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT THAT,
IS IT TRUE ?

2546
01:59:11,042 --> 01:59:13,311
IT'S BEEN RUMORED.

2547
01:59:13,412 --> 01:59:15,748
  YES, I HAVE
  A BRAIN TUMOR.

2548
01:59:15,847 --> 01:59:17,382
AND YOU'RE
BEING TREATED ?

2549
01:59:17,483 --> 01:59:19,719
 YES, I'M BEING
 TREATED FOR IT.

2550
01:59:21,052 --> 01:59:22,488
I NEED TO
ASK YOU ONE QUESTION

2551
01:59:22,587 --> 01:59:24,756
AND I HOPE YOU
WON'T GET ANGRY,

2552
01:59:24,856 --> 01:59:27,960
BUT HAS
EVEN THE SUGGESTION

2553
01:59:28,060 --> 01:59:29,729
THAT YOU MAY HAVE HAD

2554
01:59:29,828 --> 01:59:31,963
SOMETHING TO DO WITH
THE MURDERS OF THESE BOYS

2555
01:59:32,064 --> 01:59:34,567
CAUSED ANY PROBLEMS
WITHIN YOUR FAMILY

2556
01:59:34,667 --> 01:59:37,703
OR WITH ANY OF THE OTHER

2557
01:59:37,802 --> 01:59:39,372
VICTIM'S FAMILIES ?

2558
01:59:39,471 --> 01:59:41,407
( woman )
NO.

2559
01:59:41,506 --> 01:59:44,042
 THEY ALL THE KNOW
 THE TRUTH AND, NO.

2560
01:59:47,212 --> 01:59:49,315
DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THESE BOY'S DEATHS ?

2561
01:59:49,414 --> 01:59:51,516
  NO MORE THAN YOU DID.

2562
01:59:52,283 --> 01:59:54,186
( reporter )
SOMEONE SAID YOU'RE
BUYING A NEW HOUSE,

2563
01:59:54,287 --> 01:59:56,055
THAT YOU'RE LEAVING
WEST MEMPHIS ?

2564
01:59:56,154 --> 01:59:57,956
  ( Byers )
  I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

2565
02:00:00,225 --> 02:00:01,460
   WE MIGHT TRY TO MOVE.

2566
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:03,629
( reporter )
OUT OF WEST MEMPHIS ?

2567
02:00:03,729 --> 02:00:05,565
WELL,<i> SOMEWHERE,</i>

2568
02:00:05,664 --> 02:00:07,466
   <i> YOU</i> WOULD
    PROBABLY WANNA MOVE.

2569
02:00:07,565 --> 02:00:08,934
 YOU KNOW ?

2570
02:00:09,034 --> 02:00:10,435
   DID YOU SAY WHERE
   YOU WERE GONNA MOVE ?

2571
02:00:10,536 --> 02:00:11,671
   NO.

2572
02:00:11,770 --> 02:00:13,672
 ( woman )
 LET ME ASK YOU
 A QUESTION,

2573
02:00:13,773 --> 02:00:15,875
 WOULD YOU WANNA
 LIVE IN A HOUSE

2574
02:00:15,975 --> 02:00:18,411
 THAT YOUR BABY DIED LESS THAN
 3/4 OF A MILE FROM ?

2575
02:00:18,511 --> 02:00:19,679
 I WOULDN'T, NO.

2576
02:00:19,779 --> 02:00:21,948
THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION.

2577
02:00:22,047 --> 02:00:23,916
( reporter )
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
YOUR WHOLE FAMILY, RIGHT ?

2578
02:00:24,015 --> 02:00:25,784
YOU'RE NOT JUST
TALKING ABOUT YOU ?

2579
02:00:25,885 --> 02:00:27,954
( Byers )
YOU WOULDN'T MOVE AND LEAVE
YOUR WIFE AND CHILDREN SOMEWHERE

2580
02:00:28,054 --> 02:00:29,555
 WOULD YOU ?

2581
02:00:29,654 --> 02:00:31,657
( reporter )
NOT IF WE WERE
GONNA STAY TOGETHER.

2582
02:00:31,756 --> 02:00:33,625
   ( Byers )
   O.K.

2583
02:00:34,559 --> 02:00:37,262
   SOME OF THE QUESTIONS YOU ASK
   ARE KIND OF RIDICULOUS,

2584
02:00:37,363 --> 02:00:39,131
   SOME OF 'EM ARE KINDA

2585
02:00:39,230 --> 02:00:42,100
   ODD OR STRANGE
   OR DIFFERENT,

2586
02:00:42,201 --> 02:00:44,470
   HOW EVER YOU'D LIKE
   TO COMMENT ON 'EM,

2587
02:00:44,569 --> 02:00:47,539
  BUT, SOME OF 'EM SEEM LIKE YOU
  JUST USE A LITTLE COMMON SENSE

2588
02:00:47,640 --> 02:00:49,542
   AND THINK ABOUT
   WHAT YOU WOULD DO

2589
02:00:49,641 --> 02:00:51,476
   OR HOW YOU WOULD FEEL.

2590
02:00:51,577 --> 02:00:53,913
   SOME OF THE QUESTIONS
   YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO ASK.

2591
02:00:54,012 --> 02:00:55,547
( reporter )
WE HAVE TO ASK THEM,

2592
02:00:55,648 --> 02:00:57,717
WE CAN'T
QUOTE OURSELVES.

2593
02:00:57,817 --> 02:01:00,586
I KNOW, BUT A LOT OF TIMES
THINGS ARE PRINTED IN THE PAPER

2594
02:01:00,685 --> 02:01:03,989
THAT PEOPLE DID NOT SAY
AND THE NEWS MEDIA,

2595
02:01:04,090 --> 02:01:06,525
I'M NOT STATING
WHICH INDIVIDUAL,

2596
02:01:06,625 --> 02:01:09,127
SAYS THEY GOT IT FROM
A CONFIDENTIAL INFORMER,

2597
02:01:09,228 --> 02:01:11,631
AND YOU DON'T LIKE TO TURN YOUR
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMER OVER,

2598
02:01:11,730 --> 02:01:14,766
WHEN YOU'RE CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMER IS YOUR IMAGINATION.

2599
02:01:14,867 --> 02:01:16,836
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS
THAT PRINTED IN THE PAPER

2600
02:01:16,935 --> 02:01:19,237
THAT PEOPLE DID NOT SAY.

2601
02:01:20,305 --> 02:01:22,708
BUT THE MEDIA
HAS THE RIGHTS TO PRINT

2602
02:01:22,807 --> 02:01:24,877
WHAT THEY WANNA PRINT.

2603
02:01:24,976 --> 02:01:27,313
VICTIMS DON'T
HAVE ANY RIGHTS.

2604
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:45,264
 NOW THAT I'VE
 HEARD HIM TALK...

2605
02:01:47,198 --> 02:01:48,967
 I KINDA HAD AN IDEA
 OF WHAT HE WAS LIKE

2606
02:01:49,068 --> 02:01:50,770
  BEFORE HE TALKED,

2607
02:01:50,869 --> 02:01:52,505
   BUT AFTER HE TALKED

2608
02:01:52,604 --> 02:01:54,773
 HE WASN'T ANYTHING LIKE
 I THOUGHT HE WOULD BE.

2609
02:01:54,873 --> 02:01:56,742
( reporter )
HOW IS HE ?

2610
02:01:57,442 --> 02:01:59,845
  I SEE HIM NOW AS MORE LIKE
  A HUMAN BEING

2611
02:01:59,944 --> 02:02:01,880
 THAN I DID BEFORE.

2612
02:02:01,980 --> 02:02:03,782
   NOW I SEE HIM AS
   HAVING A PERSONALITY.

2613
02:02:06,150 --> 02:02:07,853
FROM A DEFENSE STANDPOINT,

2614
02:02:07,953 --> 02:02:09,922
I'VE NEVER BEEN
A DEFENSE ATTORNEY, BUT,

2615
02:02:10,021 --> 02:02:11,957
TO PUT HIM
ON THE WITNESS STAND,

2616
02:02:12,056 --> 02:02:14,193
SURE SEEMS TO BE
AN AWFUL BIG GAMBLE.

2617
02:02:14,292 --> 02:02:17,063
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THAT MINDSET
THAT PUTS YOU IN THE POSITION

2618
02:02:17,162 --> 02:02:19,130
WHERE YOU'RE WILLING
TO TAKE THAT GAMBLE.

2619
02:02:20,297 --> 02:02:21,766
( man )
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU
FOLLOW IT UP

2620
02:02:21,867 --> 02:02:25,070
WITH MR. BOJANGLES'

2621
02:02:25,171 --> 02:02:26,238
ACCUSATIONS.

2622
02:02:26,337 --> 02:02:28,239
IT DIDN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

2623
02:02:29,006 --> 02:02:31,576
'CAUSE TO ME,
IF I WERE ON THE JURY,

2624
02:02:31,676 --> 02:02:34,012
IT WOULD LOOK LIKE
SOMETHING DESPERATE,

2625
02:02:34,113 --> 02:02:35,780
THEY'RE GONNA
CAST BLAME ON ANYBODY

2626
02:02:35,881 --> 02:02:38,184
AND EVERYBODY THEY CAN.

2627
02:02:40,284 --> 02:02:42,387
AND THE DEFENSE
DIDN'T HAVE THE THE GUTS

2628
02:02:42,488 --> 02:02:44,890
 TO ACTUALLY ASK HIM
 DID HE DO IT ?

2629
02:02:56,033 --> 02:02:58,036
THE SONG THAT I REALLY

2630
02:02:58,136 --> 02:02:59,671
CAN RELATE TO
BY<i> METALLICA</i>

2631
02:02:59,771 --> 02:03:01,907
IS "SANITARIUM".

2632
02:03:04,341 --> 02:03:06,711
'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE ALL THOSE
TIMES I WAS PUT IN THE HOSPITAL

2633
02:03:06,811 --> 02:03:08,847
I DIDN'T NEED IT.

2634
02:03:10,481 --> 02:03:12,518
IT WAS JUST THE POLICE,

2635
02:03:12,618 --> 02:03:14,520
ANOTHER WAY FOR THEM
SETTING ME UP,

2636
02:03:14,619 --> 02:03:16,521
WHEN THEY COULDN'T
SEND ME TO PRISON.

2637
02:03:16,622 --> 02:03:18,990
WE'LL GET HIM OUT OF OUR WAY
FOR A LITTLE WHILE,

2638
02:03:19,091 --> 02:03:21,227
BY SENDING HIM
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

2639
02:03:27,131 --> 02:03:28,967
I LIKE METALLICA BECAUSE,

2640
02:03:29,068 --> 02:03:30,469
WELL, ALL...

2641
02:03:31,403 --> 02:03:33,838
HARD MUSIC LIKE THAT,
BECAUSE,

2642
02:03:33,939 --> 02:03:37,176
IT GIVES ME AN
ADRENALINE RUSH.

2643
02:03:40,645 --> 02:03:42,915
MAKES ME FEEL MORE ALIVE.

2644
02:04:51,448 --> 02:04:53,652
   NOW DURING THE COURSE OF,

2645
02:04:53,752 --> 02:04:56,121
  TALKING TO MR. ECHOLS,

2646
02:04:56,220 --> 02:04:58,456
DID YOU ASK HIM,

2647
02:04:58,556 --> 02:05:00,960
   WHO DID HE THINK
   DID IT AND WHY ?

2648
02:05:01,060 --> 02:05:02,995
   IN ONE AREA HE SAYS

2649
02:05:03,095 --> 02:05:04,930
   HE HAD AN OPINION

2650
02:05:05,029 --> 02:05:06,998
   FOR WHO COULD'VE
   DONE THE MURDERS,

2651
02:05:07,099 --> 02:05:08,766
   AS BEING SOMEONE SICK,

2652
02:05:08,867 --> 02:05:10,636
   AND IT WAS SOME TYPE OF
   THRILL KILL,

2653
02:05:10,735 --> 02:05:12,438
   HE ALSO STATED
   THAT THE PENIS

2654
02:05:12,537 --> 02:05:14,339
   WAS A SYMBOL OF POWER
   IN HIS RELIGION,

2655
02:05:14,439 --> 02:05:16,541
   KNOWN AS "WICCA",

2656
02:05:16,641 --> 02:05:18,476
HE ALSO STATED
THAT THE NUMBER 3

2657
02:05:18,577 --> 02:05:20,779
HAS A SACRED NUMBER
IN THE BELIEF.

2658
02:05:20,878 --> 02:05:23,882
( prosecutor )
DID HE TELL YOU ANYTHING
ABOUT DEMONIC FORCES ?

2659
02:05:23,983 --> 02:05:26,585
( man )
YES, HE SAID THAT ALL PEOPLE
HAVE A DEMONIC FORCE IN THEM

2660
02:05:26,685 --> 02:05:29,688
AND THAT A PERSON
WOULD HAVE NO CONTROL

2661
02:05:29,787 --> 02:05:32,190
OVER THAT DEMONIC FORCE.

2662
02:05:32,291 --> 02:05:34,393
   ( defense )
   MR. ECHOLS WAS NOT THE
   ONLY PERSON THAT TOLD YOU

2663
02:05:34,493 --> 02:05:37,730
THAT THE KIDS PROBABLY
DIED OF MUTILATION, WAS HE ?

2664
02:05:37,829 --> 02:05:39,230
( man )
NO, SIR.

2665
02:05:40,631 --> 02:05:44,068
  ( defense )
  AND, WHEN, MR. ECHOLS,
  YOU ASKED HIM,

2666
02:05:44,168 --> 02:05:46,538
  WHAT TYPE OF BOOKS
  DID HE ENJOY READING ?

2667
02:05:46,639 --> 02:05:48,774
( man )
YES, SIR.

2668
02:05:48,873 --> 02:05:50,108
   UM...

2669
02:05:50,208 --> 02:05:53,177
 AND HE TOLD YOU<i>
 ANTON LEVY</i>

2670
02:05:53,278 --> 02:05:54,646
  AND<i> STEPHEN KING</i> ?

2671
02:05:54,747 --> 02:05:56,882
YES, SIR.

2672
02:05:58,082 --> 02:06:00,652
 IN YOUR OPINION IS
 THERE ANYTHING UNUSUAL

2673
02:06:00,752 --> 02:06:03,621
   ABOUT THOSE BEING THE
   TYPE OF BOOKS THAT HE LIKES ?

2674
02:06:05,990 --> 02:06:07,725
   ANTON LEVY,

2675
02:06:07,826 --> 02:06:09,528
IS A BOOK OF

2676
02:06:09,627 --> 02:06:12,864
SATANIC RULES
AND INVOLVEMENT.

2677
02:06:12,965 --> 02:06:14,699
STEPHEN KING'S

2678
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:16,534
SEEMS TO BE HORROR MOVIES,

2679
02:06:16,635 --> 02:06:19,003
HORROR BOOKS.

2680
02:06:20,505 --> 02:06:23,742
YOU'RE ASKING IF I FELT
THAT WAS STRANGE, YES I DID.

2681
02:06:25,476 --> 02:06:28,613
   NOW LET ME REFER YOU BACK
   TO YOUR STATEMENT

2682
02:06:28,713 --> 02:06:30,815
THAT YOU GAVE
OFFICER RIDGE.

2683
02:06:32,417 --> 02:06:34,653
   DID YOU TELL HIM
   IN THAT STATEMENT

2684
02:06:34,752 --> 02:06:36,421
   THAT YOU
   HAD BEEN A MEMBER

2685
02:06:36,521 --> 02:06:38,356
  OF A WHITE WITCH GROUP
  FOR 5 YEARS ?

2686
02:06:38,457 --> 02:06:39,425
  NO.

2687
02:06:40,759 --> 02:06:43,028
 ( Damien )
 I'VE NEVER BEEN
 A MEMBER OF ANY GROUP.

2688
02:06:43,127 --> 02:06:45,797
IF HE PUT THAT IN HIS REPORT
YOU'RE SAYING THAT'S INACCURATE.

2689
02:06:45,898 --> 02:06:46,931
YES, I AM.

2690
02:06:47,032 --> 02:06:48,132
HE MADE THAT UP.

2691
02:06:48,233 --> 02:06:49,969
YES I AM.

2692
02:06:50,069 --> 02:06:52,137
ON QUESTION NUMBER NINE,

2693
02:06:52,237 --> 02:06:53,771
HOW DO YOU THINK

2694
02:06:53,872 --> 02:06:56,108
THE PERSON FEELS
THAT DID THIS ?

2695
02:06:56,207 --> 02:06:59,177
 THE ANSWER WAS,
 "PROBABLY MAKES THEM FEEL GOOD,

2696
02:06:59,278 --> 02:07:01,079
  GIVES THEM POWER."

2697
02:07:01,180 --> 02:07:03,015
  NOW, I GUESS OFFICER RIDGE
  SAID THAT TOO.

2698
02:07:03,114 --> 02:07:05,050
NO, I USED
COMMON SENSE ON THAT.

2699
02:07:05,149 --> 02:07:07,819
IF SOMEONE WAS DOING IT,
THEY MUST'VE<i> WANTED</i> TO,

2700
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:10,189
AND IF THEY WERE DOING SOMETHING
THEY<i> WANTED</i> TO

2701
02:07:10,288 --> 02:07:12,224
IT MUST'VE
MADE THEM HAPPY.

2702
02:07:12,323 --> 02:07:14,025
I DON'T THINK THEY WERE DOIN' IT
'CAUSE SOMEONE FORCED THEM TO

2703
02:07:14,126 --> 02:07:15,828
OR BECAUSE THEY
DIDN'T WANT TO.

2704
02:07:15,927 --> 02:07:18,029
 SO, IN YOUR MIND...

2705
02:07:19,363 --> 02:07:22,567
THE PERSON THAT
KILLED THESE THREE KIDS,

2706
02:07:22,667 --> 02:07:25,804
  IT'S COMMON SENSE THAT
  KILLING THREE 8 YEARS OLDS

2707
02:07:25,904 --> 02:07:27,706
  WOULD MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD.

2708
02:07:27,805 --> 02:07:29,641
WHOEVER DID IT,
IT MUST HAVE.

2709
02:07:29,742 --> 02:07:31,877
   ( prosecutor )
   DID YOU ALSO TELL HIM

2710
02:07:31,976 --> 02:07:34,546
THAT EACH PERSON HAD
A DEMONIC SIDE TO THEM ?

2711
02:07:34,645 --> 02:07:38,182
( Damien )
I BELIEVE EVERY PERSON HAS
A GOOD SIDE AND A BAD SIDE.

2712
02:07:38,283 --> 02:07:39,918
  WERE THOSE YOUR WORDS,

2713
02:07:40,018 --> 02:07:42,121
WHAT HE'S GOT WRITTEN DOWN HERE,
YOU STATED THAT

2714
02:07:42,220 --> 02:07:44,589
   THAT THERE WAS NO CONTROL
   OF THE DEMONIC FORCE

2715
02:07:44,689 --> 02:07:46,759
   IN A PEOPLE ?

2716
02:07:46,859 --> 02:07:48,694
HE ASKED ME DID I THINK
THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE

2717
02:07:48,793 --> 02:07:50,662
THAT COULD NOT
CONTROL THAT SIDE,

2718
02:07:50,762 --> 02:07:52,698
I SAID YES,
I GUESS THERE IS.

2719
02:07:52,797 --> 02:07:56,100
  ( prosecutor )
  IT ALSO STATES THAT YOU STATED
  THAT THE YOUNGER THE VICTIM

2720
02:07:56,201 --> 02:07:57,903
   WOULD MEAN MORE INNOCENT,

2721
02:07:58,002 --> 02:07:59,771
  AND IN TURN MORE POWER

2722
02:07:59,872 --> 02:08:01,774
   WOULD BE GIVEN THE PERSON
   DOING THE KILLING.

2723
02:08:01,873 --> 02:08:02,675
   RIGHT.

2724
02:08:02,774 --> 02:08:04,175
  DID YOU SAY THAT ?

2725
02:08:04,275 --> 02:08:05,043
 YES.

2726
02:08:05,144 --> 02:08:06,478
   THOSE ARE YOUR WORDS.

2727
02:08:06,578 --> 02:08:09,148
 DID YOU PICK THAT UP WHEN
 STUDYING TO BE A CATHOLIC ?

2728
02:08:09,247 --> 02:08:10,181
NO.

2729
02:08:10,282 --> 02:08:12,618
I SAW THAT ON
SEVERAL MOVIES, BOOKS.

2730
02:08:13,851 --> 02:08:15,386
  ( prosecutor )
  QUESTION #11,

2731
02:08:15,487 --> 02:08:19,123
 WHEN HE ASKED YOU,
 HOW DO YOU THINK THEY DIED,

2732
02:08:19,224 --> 02:08:20,626
 THE ANSWER IS,

2733
02:08:20,725 --> 02:08:22,694
   "MUTILATION,
   CUT UP ALL THREE,

2734
02:08:22,795 --> 02:08:25,497
  "HEARD THEY WERE
  IN THE WATER DROWNING,

2735
02:08:25,596 --> 02:08:28,533
 CUT UP ONE MORE
 THAN THE OTHERS..."

2736
02:08:30,100 --> 02:08:32,804
 IS THAT AGAIN
 WHAT OFFICER RIDGE SAID

2737
02:08:32,904 --> 02:08:34,939
   AND YOU JUST AGREED ?

2738
02:08:35,039 --> 02:08:37,408
 NO, I SAW THAT ON TV,
 NEWSPAPERS,

2739
02:08:37,509 --> 02:08:39,610
 PEOPLE TALKIN'.

2740
02:08:41,011 --> 02:08:42,081
  AND...

2741
02:08:45,250 --> 02:08:48,052
 YOU KNEW ABOUT
 THE DROWNING, CORRECT ?

2742
02:08:48,153 --> 02:08:49,588
I KNEW THAT THEY WERE
IN THE WATER,

2743
02:08:49,688 --> 02:08:51,457
I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT THEY DROWNED.

2744
02:08:51,556 --> 02:08:53,559
   YOU KNEW THAT ONE WAS
   CUT UP MORE THAN THE OTHERS ?

2745
02:08:53,658 --> 02:08:56,728
HE SAID, "DO YOU THINK ONE WAS
HURT WORSE THAN THE OTHERS ?"

2746
02:08:56,828 --> 02:08:59,797
 OH, SO AGAIN,
 THAT PARTICULAR AREA'S,

2747
02:08:59,898 --> 02:09:01,766
ONE OF THOSE THINGS
WHERE OFFICER RIDGE TOLD YOU

2748
02:09:01,867 --> 02:09:03,668
 AND THAT WASN'T
 YOUR RESPONSE,

2749
02:09:03,769 --> 02:09:06,171
YOU JUST RESPONDED ABOUT
THE DROWNING AND MUTILATION.

2750
02:09:06,270 --> 02:09:07,972
IF HE DIDN'T GET
THE ANSWER HE LIKED,

2751
02:09:08,073 --> 02:09:10,109
HE WOULD GO BACK AND TRY TO
GET ME TO SAY SOMETHING ELSE.

2752
02:09:10,208 --> 02:09:11,976
AND IT'S YOUR TESTIMONY,
SPECIFICALLY,

2753
02:09:12,077 --> 02:09:13,712
THAT YOU WEREN'T
THE ONE WHO SAID

2754
02:09:13,811 --> 02:09:15,646
THAT ONE WAS CUT UP
MORE THAN THE OTHER,

2755
02:09:15,747 --> 02:09:17,649
   THAT IT WAS OFFICER RIDGE
   WHO SAID THAT.

2756
02:09:17,748 --> 02:09:19,484
I AGREED WITH HIM
WHEN HE SAID THAT.

2757
02:09:19,585 --> 02:09:21,653
AND IF HE SAYS
SOMETHING DIFFERENT,

2758
02:09:21,752 --> 02:09:23,921
   HE'D BE LYING
   ABOUT IT, RIGHT ?

2759
02:09:24,021 --> 02:09:25,457
  YOU'RE THE ONE
  TELLIN' THE TRUTH.

2760
02:09:25,556 --> 02:09:27,992
I WOULDN'T
PUT IT PAST HIM.

2761
02:09:32,229 --> 02:09:34,599
  ( man )
  DAMIEN, WE'RE GETTING
  CLOSE TO THE END NOW.

2762
02:09:34,699 --> 02:09:36,702
   HOW DO YOU
   FEEL SO FAR ?

2763
02:09:37,902 --> 02:09:39,637
I FEEL GOOD SO FAR.

2764
02:09:39,738 --> 02:09:42,441
TO ME IT LOOKS LIKE
WE GOT IT BEAT.

2765
02:09:42,541 --> 02:09:45,711
   ( man )
   WHAT DO YOU THINK THE
   WORST THING FOR US HAS BEEN ?

2766
02:09:45,810 --> 02:09:48,514
  IN THE THREE WEEKS
  WE'VE BEEN HERE,

2767
02:09:48,613 --> 02:09:51,250
 WHAT HAS
 HURT THE MOST ?

2768
02:09:51,850 --> 02:09:54,086
I ONLY KNOW OF TWO THINGS
THAT HAVE REALLY HURT,

2769
02:09:54,185 --> 02:09:55,820
THAT ONE KID GETTIN'
UP THERE FOR JASON,

2770
02:09:55,921 --> 02:09:58,957
AND THOSE GIRLS.

2771
02:09:59,890 --> 02:10:01,893
( man )
THE THURSDAY'S NEWSPAPER

2772
02:10:01,993 --> 02:10:03,996
WHICH ADDRESSED YOU
TESTIFYING ON WEDNESDAY,

2773
02:10:04,095 --> 02:10:05,596
  WAS REAL GOOD,

2774
02:10:05,697 --> 02:10:07,699
  IT TALKED ABOUT
  THAT YOU DID WELL,

2775
02:10:07,798 --> 02:10:09,667
BUT FRIDAY'S,
REGARDING YOUR THURDAY TESTIMONY

2776
02:10:09,768 --> 02:10:12,003
 WASN'T AS GOOD,
 WHAT DO YOU THINK ?

2777
02:10:12,104 --> 02:10:13,838
I THINK I DID REAL GOOD
THE FIRST DAY,

2778
02:10:13,939 --> 02:10:15,874
THE SECOND DAY
IT DIDN'T LOOK AS GOOD,

2779
02:10:15,974 --> 02:10:18,677
BECAUSE THEY KEPT TRYING
TO TRIP ME UP OR SOMETHING.

2780
02:10:19,444 --> 02:10:22,514
( man )
THERE WAS ONE POINT IN THERE
WHERE HE ASKED YOU

2781
02:10:22,613 --> 02:10:25,550
 HE SAYS "IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR
 JUST CHANGIN' YOUR STORY,

2782
02:10:25,650 --> 02:10:28,420
 TO FIT
 WHATEVER COMES UP",

2783
02:10:28,520 --> 02:10:30,756
AND YOU SAID "YEAH".

2784
02:10:30,855 --> 02:10:33,591
I WAS JUST LIKE
HALFWAY LISTENING TO HIM.

2785
02:10:33,692 --> 02:10:36,461
I WAS REAL NERVOUS
WHEN I FIRST GOT UP THERE,

2786
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:38,529
ENOUGH TO KEEP MY
ATTENTION FOCUSED,

2787
02:10:38,630 --> 02:10:40,699
AFTER I WAS
UP THERE A FEW MINUTES,

2788
02:10:40,798 --> 02:10:42,568
I JUST STARTED DAY DREAMING.

2789
02:10:44,502 --> 02:10:46,238
 "DAY DREAMING".

2790
02:10:46,337 --> 02:10:47,171
( laughs )

2791
02:10:50,440 --> 02:10:53,545
 MAYBE THEY'LL ONLY HALFWAY
 KILL YOU WHEN THEY CONVICT YOU.

2792
02:10:53,645 --> 02:10:55,214
"HALFWAY" ?

2793
02:10:55,314 --> 02:10:56,782
HOW DO THEY DO THAT ?

2794
02:10:56,881 --> 02:10:58,449
   I DON'T KNOW,

2795
02:10:58,550 --> 02:11:01,220
 MAYBE THEY'LL START
 DAY DREAMING.

2796
02:11:02,921 --> 02:11:06,124
ANYTHING WRONG WITH WEARING
BLACK IN AND OF ITSELF ?

2797
02:11:07,292 --> 02:11:08,126
   NO.

2798
02:11:09,127 --> 02:11:11,730
ANYTHING WRONG WITH
THE HEAVY METAL STUFF ?

2799
02:11:11,829 --> 02:11:12,930
NO...

2800
02:11:13,030 --> 02:11:15,701
THE BOOK,
ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT ?

2801
02:11:15,801 --> 02:11:17,669
NO, BUT WHEN
YOU LOOK AT IT TOGETHER,

2802
02:11:17,769 --> 02:11:20,572
YOU BEGIN TO SEE INSIDE

2803
02:11:20,671 --> 02:11:23,407
DAMIEN ECHOLS,

2804
02:11:23,507 --> 02:11:25,810
YOU SEE INSIDE
THAT PERSON,

2805
02:11:25,911 --> 02:11:28,881
AND YOU LOOK INSIDE THERE
AND THERE'S NOT A SOUL IN THERE.

2806
02:11:28,980 --> 02:11:31,082
MY CLIENT IS A TEEN-AGER,

2807
02:11:31,182 --> 02:11:33,484
AND WE CERTAINLY DIDN'T
HIDE THAT FACT FROM YA.

2808
02:11:33,585 --> 02:11:36,454
AND THE FACT THAT MY CLIENT
DID SOME WRITINGS,

2809
02:11:36,555 --> 02:11:38,557
TAKE THESE BACK,
GO BACK AND READ 'EM,

2810
02:11:38,657 --> 02:11:40,993
BUT THIS, IN AND OF ITSELF,

2811
02:11:41,092 --> 02:11:42,927
IS NO EVIDENCE OF MURDER,

2812
02:11:43,028 --> 02:11:44,796
AND EVEN IF YOU ADDED
ALL THE OTHER THINGS,

2813
02:11:44,895 --> 02:11:46,631
"TRAPPINGS OF OCCULTISM",

2814
02:11:46,731 --> 02:11:48,600
ACCORDING TO
DR. GRIFFIS,

2815
02:11:48,699 --> 02:11:51,603
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THIS CASE WHATSOEVER.

2816
02:11:51,703 --> 02:11:53,639
IS IT A COINCIDENCE...

2817
02:11:55,105 --> 02:11:58,242
THAT THIS KNIFE IS FOUND,
IN THE LAKE,

2818
02:11:58,342 --> 02:11:59,610
HIDDEN...

2819
02:12:00,845 --> 02:12:02,881
BEHIND JASON BALDWIN'S HOUSE ?

2820
02:12:02,980 --> 02:12:05,483
THERE ARE MARKS
ON CHRISTOPHER BYERS,

2821
02:12:05,583 --> 02:12:07,752
WHERE YOU GOT
LIKE A DASH,

2822
02:12:07,853 --> 02:12:10,188
WHERE IT'S A CUT,

2823
02:12:10,287 --> 02:12:11,689
A CUT, AN OPEN SPACE,

2824
02:12:11,789 --> 02:12:13,824
A CUT, AN OPEN SPACE.

2825
02:12:13,925 --> 02:12:17,061
AND IF YOU TAKE
THIS KNIFE

2826
02:12:17,162 --> 02:12:18,797
AND YOU DO THAT,

2827
02:12:18,896 --> 02:12:20,631
YOU CAN SEE IT LEAVES

2828
02:12:20,731 --> 02:12:23,702
A CUT AND AN OPEN SPACE,
A CUT AND AN OPEN SPACE.

2829
02:12:23,801 --> 02:12:26,203
NOW, IF YOU TAKE...

2830
02:12:28,072 --> 02:12:30,175
<i> THIS</i> KNIFE...

2831
02:12:30,774 --> 02:12:31,809
EXHIBIT...

2832
02:12:33,543 --> 02:12:35,948
DEFENSE EXHIBIT SIX...

2833
02:12:36,047 --> 02:12:38,115
AND EVEN WITH
THE SLIGHTEST PRESSURE,

2834
02:12:38,216 --> 02:12:40,619
IT MAKES A STRAIGHT LINE.

2835
02:12:41,418 --> 02:12:43,287
 CRIME SCENE...

2836
02:12:43,720 --> 02:12:46,123
 IT DOESN'T FIT FOR A KID

2837
02:12:46,224 --> 02:12:48,060
 TO BLEED TO DEATH,

2838
02:12:48,159 --> 02:12:50,662
 AND NOT LEAVE
 A DROP BEHIND.

2839
02:12:51,429 --> 02:12:54,533
 FOR ALL THE OTHER INJURIES
 TO THEIR FACES,

2840
02:12:54,632 --> 02:12:57,135
 THESE OTHER INJURIES
 ARE GONNA BLEED TOO.

2841
02:12:57,234 --> 02:12:59,570
 AND THERE'S NOT
 A DROP OF BLOOD ?

2842
02:12:59,671 --> 02:13:02,274
 NOT A DROP OF BLOOD ?

2843
02:13:02,373 --> 02:13:03,841
LOOK AT HISTORY,

2844
02:13:03,942 --> 02:13:06,877
LOOK AT HUNDREDS OF YEARS
OF RELIGIOUS HISTORY.

2845
02:13:06,978 --> 02:13:09,780
THERE HAVE BEEN HUNDREDS
OF PEOPLE KILLED

2846
02:13:09,881 --> 02:13:11,984
IN THE NAME OF RELIGION.

2847
02:13:12,083 --> 02:13:13,851
IT IS A MOTIVATING FORCE,

2848
02:13:13,952 --> 02:13:16,488
IT GIVES PEOPLE
WHO WANT TO DO EVIL,

2849
02:13:16,587 --> 02:13:18,456
WANT TO COMMIT MURDERS,

2850
02:13:18,556 --> 02:13:21,193
A REASON TO DO
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

2851
02:13:21,826 --> 02:13:23,929
( defense )
SATANIC PANIC.

2852
02:13:25,496 --> 02:13:27,666
YEAH, THAT'S A SCARY THING.

2853
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:32,003
IT'S A SCARIER THING TO CONVICT
SOMEONE WITH NO EVIDENCE,

2854
02:13:32,104 --> 02:13:33,872
IF YOU CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT,
IF IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE,

2855
02:13:33,971 --> 02:13:36,041
LET'S CALL IT
A CULT KILLING,

2856
02:13:36,140 --> 02:13:38,076
AND FIND
SOMEBODY WEIRD !

2857
02:13:40,978 --> 02:13:42,847
FIND SOMEBODY
WHO WEARS BLACK !

2858
02:13:44,782 --> 02:13:47,252
BUT, THEY LET ONE THING

2859
02:13:47,351 --> 02:13:49,787
GO BY THE WAYSIDE...

2860
02:13:50,988 --> 02:13:53,057
IS THAT THERE'S NOTHING
THAT LINKS JASON

2861
02:13:53,158 --> 02:13:55,160
TO THESE ACTIVITIES.

2862
02:13:55,260 --> 02:13:56,695
NOT ONE WITNESS SAYS,

2863
02:13:56,795 --> 02:13:58,630
"THAT'S WHAT HE DOES,

2864
02:13:58,729 --> 02:14:00,398
THAT'S HIS BELIEFS".

2865
02:14:00,498 --> 02:14:02,733
WE DON'T HAVE A WRITING,
A DRAWING, A PICTURE,

2866
02:14:02,833 --> 02:14:04,869
NOT A PERSON,<i> NOTHING...</i>

2867
02:14:04,970 --> 02:14:06,872
LINKS HIM TO IT.

2868
02:14:07,572 --> 02:14:09,373
BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

2869
02:14:09,474 --> 02:14:11,610
THAT DOESN'T MATTER TO THEM !

2870
02:14:11,710 --> 02:14:13,444
BECAUSE HE'S SITTIN'
OVER THERE WITH DAMIEN,

2871
02:14:13,545 --> 02:14:15,380
THEY WANT YOU
TO CONVICT HIM.

2872
02:14:15,479 --> 02:14:17,581
GUILT BY ASSOCIATION

2873
02:14:17,681 --> 02:14:19,917
IS A HORRIBLE THING.

2874
02:14:28,225 --> 02:14:30,694
( reporter )
DAMIEN, DO YOU THINK
HE LOOKS LIKE YOU ?

2875
02:14:30,795 --> 02:14:33,230
   I DON'T KNOW,
   NOT REALLY.

2876
02:14:33,331 --> 02:14:35,300
I THINK HE'S GOT
DOMINI'S EARS.

2877
02:14:45,943 --> 02:14:48,680
( reporter )
CAN YOU CHANGE
HIS DIAPERS, DAMIEN ?

2878
02:14:58,256 --> 02:14:59,858
( reporter )
DO YOU THINK
YOU'LL BE SPENDING

2879
02:14:59,957 --> 02:15:02,126
MORE TIME
WITH YOUR CHILD ?

2880
02:15:03,927 --> 02:15:04,996
I HOPE.

2881
02:15:10,333 --> 02:15:12,002
  ( man )
  C'MON, DAMIEN,
  IT'S TIME.

2882
02:15:34,091 --> 02:15:37,195
( man )
WHAT'S HIS FIRST WORDS
GONNA BE, "NOT GUILTY" ?

2883
02:15:38,261 --> 02:15:41,065
HIS FIRST WORDS WILL BE
"CAPITAL MURDER".

2884
02:15:56,680 --> 02:15:59,550
( man )
WHAT'S IT FEEL LIKE TO
GO THROUGH A MONTH LONG TRIAL

2885
02:15:59,650 --> 02:16:02,621
ACCUSED OF SOMETHING
YOU DIDN'T DO ?

2886
02:16:02,720 --> 02:16:03,988
   HORRIBLE.

2887
02:16:09,292 --> 02:16:10,628
ARE YOU NERVOUS NOW ?

2888
02:16:10,729 --> 02:16:11,896
   YEAH.

2889
02:16:11,997 --> 02:16:14,599
THERE'S NOTHIN' WE CAN DO NOW
BUT SIT AROUND AND WAIT,

2890
02:16:14,698 --> 02:16:17,101
BUT, YOU GOT ANYTHING

2891
02:16:17,202 --> 02:16:19,070
YOU WANNA ASK ME ?

2892
02:16:22,038 --> 02:16:24,475
 WHERE DO WE GO WHEN
 THE JURY COMES BACK OUT

2893
02:16:24,576 --> 02:16:26,877
AND SAYS
I'M NOT GUILTY ?

2894
02:16:28,845 --> 02:16:32,049
WHERE DO YOU WANNA GO ?

2895
02:16:32,717 --> 02:16:34,619
  <i> DISNEYLAND</i> MAYBE.

2896
02:16:34,718 --> 02:16:36,487
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO GO TO<i> DISNEYLAND</i> ?

2897
02:16:36,587 --> 02:16:40,057
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
ON A TRIP AT ALL ?

2898
02:16:41,225 --> 02:16:42,927
  <i> THE SPRINGS.</i>

2899
02:16:45,462 --> 02:16:47,599
WELL I TELL YOU
WHAT, MY MAN,

2900
02:16:47,699 --> 02:16:49,501
IT WOULD BE A JOY
TO TAKE YOU.

2901
02:16:49,601 --> 02:16:51,670
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO ?

2902
02:16:51,770 --> 02:16:52,938
 YEAH.

2903
02:16:54,171 --> 02:16:55,773
DO YOU UNDERSTAND NOW

2904
02:16:55,873 --> 02:16:59,076
WHY WE DIDN'T
WANT YOU TO TESTIFY ?

2905
02:16:59,176 --> 02:17:00,145
   YEAH.

2906
02:17:02,479 --> 02:17:05,916
DO YOU SEE HOW THAT HURT DAMIEN,
I THINK IT DID.

2907
02:17:06,016 --> 02:17:08,719
DID YOU SEE HOW THEY
TALKED ABOUT HIS WITNESSES ?

2908
02:17:08,819 --> 02:17:10,654
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO TALK ABOUT US,

2909
02:17:10,754 --> 02:17:12,656
THEY DIDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO TALK ABOUT,

2910
02:17:12,756 --> 02:17:14,893
'CAUSE WE DIDN'T
GIVE 'EM A CHANCE.

2911
02:17:14,993 --> 02:17:16,127
AND...

2912
02:17:20,064 --> 02:17:22,000
OH, MAN.

2913
02:17:22,100 --> 02:17:23,201
IT'S HEAVY.

2914
02:17:27,971 --> 02:17:29,673
DO YOU THINK THAT

2915
02:17:29,773 --> 02:17:31,909
THIS WILL CHANGE AT ALL...

2916
02:17:34,645 --> 02:17:36,881
HOW YOU CHOOSE
YOUR FRIENDS ?

2917
02:17:36,980 --> 02:17:37,949
   YEAH.

2918
02:17:39,617 --> 02:17:41,819
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THIS WILL DO

2919
02:17:41,920 --> 02:17:45,222
TO YOU AND YOUR
FRIENDSHIP WITH DAMIEN ?

2920
02:17:50,293 --> 02:17:51,962
   STOP IT, I GUESS.

2921
02:17:52,063 --> 02:17:53,597
WOULD YOU STOP
BEING HIS FRIEND ?

2922
02:17:53,698 --> 02:17:55,734
I WOULDN'T BE HIS ENEMY,

2923
02:17:55,834 --> 02:17:58,870
 BUT, I PROBABLY
 WOULDN'T BE AROUND.

2924
02:17:58,969 --> 02:18:01,238
YOU HEARD WHAT WAS
SAID ABOUT HIM.

2925
02:18:01,338 --> 02:18:03,274
DO YOU THINK HE
COULD'VE DONE IT ?

2926
02:18:06,243 --> 02:18:07,945
  ABOUT WHAT THEY SAID ?

2927
02:18:08,046 --> 02:18:09,547
DO YOU THINK
DAMIEN COULD'VE

2928
02:18:09,647 --> 02:18:12,217
KILLED THOSE LITTLE BOYS ?

2929
02:18:24,495 --> 02:18:26,731
   THEY MADE IT
   SEEM LIKE HE DID.

2930
02:18:29,100 --> 02:18:30,335
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?

2931
02:18:30,434 --> 02:18:32,069
   I DON'T KNOW.

2932
02:18:35,940 --> 02:18:37,609
IF YOU WERE
ON THAT JURY

2933
02:18:37,709 --> 02:18:39,878
WOULD YOU HAVE A HARD TIME
LETTING HIM GO ?

2934
02:18:41,245 --> 02:18:43,114
BASED ON
WHAT YOU HEARD ?

2935
02:18:43,213 --> 02:18:44,114
   YEAH.

2936
02:18:51,888 --> 02:18:53,991
I WOULD TOO.

2937
02:18:54,092 --> 02:18:55,659
WOULD YOU
LET YOURSELF GO ?

2938
02:18:59,729 --> 02:19:01,065
  YEAH.

2939
02:19:01,165 --> 02:19:02,566
  IF I WAS...

2940
02:19:02,666 --> 02:19:04,501
  UP THERE
  I'D LET MYSELF GO.

2941
02:19:04,602 --> 02:19:07,172
  THAT'S THE ANSWER
  I WANNA HEAR.

2942
02:19:07,272 --> 02:19:09,040
'CAUSE YOU KNOW YOU
DIDN'T DO IT, DON'T YOU ?

2943
02:19:09,139 --> 02:19:10,108
   YEAH.

2944
02:19:13,611 --> 02:19:16,748
   ( man )
   DID PAUL SURPRISE YOU
   ON HIS CLOSING ?

2945
02:19:16,847 --> 02:19:18,782
I THINK PAUL
SHOULD'VE LEFT OUT

2946
02:19:18,882 --> 02:19:20,784
THE GUILT
BY ASSOCIATION PART.

2947
02:19:20,885 --> 02:19:22,820
   HE CAME OUT HARD ON THAT,
   DIDN'T HE ?

2948
02:19:22,921 --> 02:19:25,590
  DID YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
  HE WAS GONNA DO THAT ?

2949
02:19:25,690 --> 02:19:26,791
MM-MMM.

2950
02:19:28,058 --> 02:19:30,628
I THOUGHT HE'D BE SMART ENOUGH
TO STAY AWAY FROM THAT.

2951
02:19:31,995 --> 02:19:33,897
HURT YOUR FEELINGS ?

2952
02:19:35,365 --> 02:19:38,036
I WANTED TO
STRANGLE HIM.

2953
02:19:42,105 --> 02:19:43,975
 WERE YOU
 WATCHING THE JURY ?

2954
02:19:44,075 --> 02:19:45,076
MM-HMM.

2955
02:19:45,775 --> 02:19:48,078
HOW DO YOU PICK IT ?

2956
02:19:48,179 --> 02:19:49,814
WITH MY FINGER.

2957
02:19:49,914 --> 02:19:50,915
( laughs )

2958
02:19:53,851 --> 02:19:56,921
NOW, I THINK IT WAS
PROBABLY ABOUT 60-40.

2959
02:19:57,021 --> 02:19:58,456
40 FOR US,

2960
02:19:58,556 --> 02:20:00,891
AND 60 AGAINST US.

2961
02:20:02,959 --> 02:20:05,829
ONCE YOU GET OUTTA HERE,
YOU GONNA BUY THE BEER ?

2962
02:20:05,930 --> 02:20:07,631
THE WHISKEY.

2963
02:20:09,066 --> 02:20:10,769
I DON'T WANT BEER.

2964
02:20:12,136 --> 02:20:14,005
AND I'LL BUY
THE BOJANGLES' CHICKEN.

2965
02:20:21,444 --> 02:20:23,715
I WANNA GET A CIGAR,

2966
02:20:23,815 --> 02:20:25,717
CUT IT OPEN AND DUMP
ALL THE TOBACCO OUT,

2967
02:20:25,816 --> 02:20:27,918
FILL IT UP WITH MARIJUANA,

2968
02:20:28,019 --> 02:20:30,255
SMOKE THE WHOLE THING.

2969
02:20:30,354 --> 02:20:31,889
WE GOTTA
GET YOU OUT OF HERE,

2970
02:20:31,989 --> 02:20:34,291
YOU GOTTA GO TO WORK
AND PAY MY BILL.

2971
02:20:36,426 --> 02:20:38,862
I'LL GET A JOB AT
A GAS STATION OR SOMETHING,

2972
02:20:38,962 --> 02:20:41,065
CHANGE MY NAME
TO "BOB SMITH".

2973
02:20:41,865 --> 02:20:43,768
ALRIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

2974
02:20:43,868 --> 02:20:46,703
THE BAILIFF'S INFORMED ME

02:20:46,804 --> 02:20:49,974

ALL OF THE VERDICTS

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

2991
02:21:53,870 --> 02:21:56,006
IT'S NECESSARY AT THIS TIME
THAT THE COURT

2992
02:21:56,106 --> 02:21:58,075
POLL THE JURY,

2993
02:21:58,175 --> 02:22:00,644
AS TO ALL SIX VERDICTS,

2994
02:22:00,745 --> 02:22:03,648
SO WHEN YOUR
NAME IS CALLED,

2995
02:22:03,747 --> 02:22:05,750
IF THESE SIX VERDICTS

2996
02:22:05,850 --> 02:22:07,784
REPRESENT YOUR
INDIVIDUAL VERDICT,

2997
02:22:07,885 --> 02:22:11,055
THEN ANSWER "YES"
AS YOUR NAME IS CALLED.

2998
02:22:11,988 --> 02:22:13,490

   ( woman )
   YES.

3006
02:22:34,845 --> 02:22:36,847
THE PROSECUTION DIDN'T
HAVE ANY EVIDENCE,

3007
02:22:36,948 --> 02:22:39,149
BUT THEY DON'T CARE.

3008
02:22:39,250 --> 02:22:40,718
JUST BECAUSE
SOMEBODY WEARS BLACK

3009
02:22:40,817 --> 02:22:42,586
AND HAS DIFFERENT BELIEFS,

3010
02:22:42,686 --> 02:22:44,988
THEY'RE GONNA CONVICT THEM
OF SOMETHING.

3011
02:22:45,088 --> 02:22:47,825
   ( woman )
   POOR, POOR PARENTS,
   YEAH, I'M SORRY FOR 'EM--

 I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
 ABOUT THE PARENTS,

3014
02:22:53,197 --> 02:22:54,665

 ( sobbing )
 I AIN'T,

3016

AIN'T SORRY FOR AN.

3017

( woman )
THERE'S NO REASON TO

3018
02:23:00,704 --> 02:23:03,040
   KILL THREE<i> MORE</i> BOYS.

3019
02:23:03,140 --> 02:23:06,010
 THAT DIDN'T DO
 A DAMN THING.

3020
02:23:07,577 --> 02:23:09,846
( woman )
RIGHT NOW I WISH
I WAS A WITCH,

3021
02:23:09,947 --> 02:23:11,915
TALK ABOUT
A SPELL ON SOMEBODY.

3022
02:23:12,015 --> 02:23:14,084
  BOY, I'D PUT
  A GOOD ONE ON.

3023
02:23:15,218 --> 02:23:17,487
I GUESS GITCHELL GOES OUT
WITH A BIG "BANG",

3024
02:23:17,587 --> 02:23:20,625
YOU KNOW HE'S FUCKIN'
GONNA RETIRE.

3025
02:23:20,725 --> 02:23:23,327
   ( woman )
   NOW HE'S PROBABLY
   GONNA RUN FOR OFFICE.

3026
02:23:24,560 --> 02:23:26,965
I GOT AN OFFICE FOR HIM.

3027
02:23:28,131 --> 02:23:29,600
 MAYOR OF HELL.

3028
02:23:29,700 --> 02:23:32,669
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED
WEST MEMPHIS CAN GO TO HELL.

3029
02:23:32,770 --> 02:23:34,706
   ( woman )
   WEST MEMPHIS<i> IS</i> HELL.

3030
02:23:34,806 --> 02:23:37,507
I HAVE PUT
MY 20 YEARS IN,

3031
02:23:37,608 --> 02:23:40,378
AND HOPEFULLY THIS IS
THE LAST CASE

3032
02:23:40,477 --> 02:23:42,613
I'LL HAVE
OF THIS MAGNITUDE,

3033
02:23:42,713 --> 02:23:45,649
HOPEFULLY,
IT'S MY LAST CASE.

3034
02:23:45,750 --> 02:23:46,516
AND...

3035
02:23:47,784 --> 02:23:49,453
I'M LEAVING
ON A HIGH NOTE.

3036
02:23:49,554 --> 02:23:51,355
SO THERE'S NO BETTER
WAY TO LEAVE

3037
02:23:51,456 --> 02:23:53,558
THAN YOUR HEAD UP,
HIGH AND PROUD.

3038
02:23:54,458 --> 02:23:57,028
 WELL YOU KNOW,
 I DON'T--

3039
02:23:58,796 --> 02:24:01,065
   I'M NOT SURPRISED,
   IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ASKING.

3040
02:24:01,165 --> 02:24:02,634
 I TOLD YOU EARLIER,

3041
02:24:02,734 --> 02:24:04,769
   I THOUGHT THE EVIDENCE
   WAS MORE THAN SUFFICIENT

3042
02:24:04,869 --> 02:24:06,971
   TO MAKE THOSE FINDINGS.

3043
02:24:07,070 --> 02:24:09,006
 THEY WON'T KILL
 NO MORE BABIES.

3044
02:24:09,106 --> 02:24:11,408
 NO MORE BABIES
 WILL THEY KILL.

3045
02:24:13,377 --> 02:24:14,545
LET'S GO.

3046
02:25:30,888 --> 02:25:32,690
( woman )
YOU'RE GONNA GET OUT !

3047
02:25:39,429 --> 02:25:41,733
( man )
YOU'RE GONNA
FRY, DAMIEN !

3048
02:25:42,498 --> 02:25:44,835
( woman )
YOU'RE GONNA FRY, DAMIEN !

3049
02:25:50,006 --> 02:25:51,575
( man )
WE KNOW YOU'RE
INNOCENT, JASON !

3050
02:26:26,510 --> 02:26:28,445
I KNEW FROM WHEN
I WAS REAL SMALL,

3051
02:26:28,546 --> 02:26:30,948
THAT PEOPLE WERE
GONNA KNOW WHO I WAS,

3052
02:26:31,048 --> 02:26:32,617
I ALWAYS HAD THAT FEELIN',

3053
02:26:32,717 --> 02:26:34,385
BUT, I JUST NEVER KNEW HOW

3054
02:26:34,485 --> 02:26:36,453
THEY WERE GONNA LEARN.

3055
02:26:38,754 --> 02:26:41,558
I KINDA ENJOY IT,
'CAUSE NOW EVEN AFTER I DIE,

3056
02:26:41,658 --> 02:26:43,593
PEOPLE ARE GONNA
REMEMBER ME FOREVER,

3057
02:26:43,693 --> 02:26:45,629
THEY'RE GONNA
TALK ABOUT ME FOR YEARS,

3058
02:26:45,729 --> 02:26:47,364
PEOPLE IN
WEST MEMPHIS WILL

3059
02:26:47,465 --> 02:26:49,600
TELL THEIR KIDS STORIES,

3060
02:26:49,700 --> 02:26:51,769
IT'LL BE SORT OF LIKE

3061
02:26:51,869 --> 02:26:54,772
I'M THE WEST MEMPHIS BOOGEY MAN.

3062
02:26:54,871 --> 02:26:56,506
LITTLE KIDS WILL BE
LOOKIN' UNDER THEIR BED,

3063
02:26:56,606 --> 02:26:59,075
"DAMIEN MIGHT BE
UNDER THERE."
