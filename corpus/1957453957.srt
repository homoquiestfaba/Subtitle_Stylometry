All with the clan coat of arms, of course.

Several things.

[guide] Aye, well, perhaps one of them
could be fixing the door to the library.

200
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:21,916
- It's hard to get the people in.
- Aye, it's even harder to get them out.

Oh, well, um, could I just
wander around a little on my own?

[laughs] I'm afraid that's not...

208

It's all right, Thomas.
I'll give her a tour.

Some date back to the 14th century.

where the third duchess

Aye. Tourists don't usually
stay in our village.

- Oh, it's hard when they move away.
- It's harder when they move back in.

348
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,125
[laughing]

349
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,750
And your husband?

350
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:21,083
Uh, it's been a year since my divorce.

351
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,416
- Oh.
- It's been four since mine.

352
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,750
I've got a boyfriend in the bakery.

353
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,750
- He just doesn't know it yet!
- I'm still married.

354
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:33,583
Although, I'm not sure he knows it either.

355
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:36,375
- [Sophie laughs]
- Not true. You two are madly in love.

356
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:37,541
We are.

357
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,791
[Angus laughing]

358
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:44,791
It's nice to hear him laugh like that.
He hasn't spoken a word since Graham died.

359
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,958
[Rhona] I still can't believe

360
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:50,000
you chose our little village
to write the next Emma Gale!

361
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:54,375
Well, I was supposed to come here
a long time ago with my dad.

362
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,375
But he got sick, and we never made it.

363
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,333
I'm so sorry.

364
00:19:00,416 --> 00:19:02,833
He lived at Dunbar Castle as a kid.

365
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:06,041
Well, outside the castle.
They weren't allowed inside.

366
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:10,291
- His family, they were the groundskeepers.
- You mean your family?

367
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,291
My family. The McGuintys.

368
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,333
Ah, you're one of us, then. [chuckles]

369
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:19,125
McGuinty. I... I don't think
I've heard that name around here.

370
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,416
Well, they moved to New York
when he was a boy.

371
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,750
I was at school with a McGuinty
back in the day.

372
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,291
A real talker, that one.

373
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,750
Always blethering and telling the tales.

374
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,375
- [Helen chuckles]
- Callum McGuinty?

375
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,166
That's him.

376
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,333
Of course, we called him something else.

377
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,125
McMotormouth.

378
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,500
[all laughing]

379
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:45,083
[Helen] Oh, you have his smile.

380
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:47,708
[laughs]

381
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,541
[sobs] Oh, I don't know why I'm crying.

382
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,333
Because these are your roots, dear.

383
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:58,625
[exhales]

384
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,291
I wish I'd come back sooner.

385
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,875
- Well, you're here now.
- [Helen] Mm-hmm.

386
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,625
And you got to see Dun Dunbar
while it's still a castle.

387
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,333
- What do you mean?
- It's... it's up for sale.

388
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,416
A lot of the old castles are for sale.

389
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,416
Aberdeenshire's cheaper
than a Range Rover.

390
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,833
And you'd be more comfortable
living in a Range Rover.

391
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,458
[all laughing]

392
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,708
- [Helen] Oh, Angus.
- [Sophie] Wow. Thank you.

393
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,125
[Helen] That's great.

394
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,208
[sentimental music playing]

395
00:20:39,291 --> 00:20:40,583
[inhales]

396
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,750
[man] So someone wants a trophy castle?

397
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:49,875
[gunshot]

398
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,583
I didn't get that feeling.

399
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:56,041
It's worse, then. They wanna tear it down
for condos and a golf course.

400
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,291
Here's the offer.

401
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,583
And it's rather large.

402
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,750
I'm doing the tours and the gift shop.

403
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,916
I've agreed to the weddings
and... and maybe even a funeral or two.

404
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,125
Maybe your own.

405
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,333
Look, we've been mates for a long time.

406
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:13,166
I've bent over backwards,
keeping you out of foreclosure.

407
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,625
I just need a little more time, Ian.

408
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:19,625
There is no more time
unless you sell off the farmlands.

409
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,541
No, I can't do that.

410
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,500
- Myles...
- No, it's out of the question!

411
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,208
Uh, Ms. Brown has arrived.

412
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:32,208
- Sophie Brown. Myles Dunbar.
- You're the royal arse?

413
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,125
- You're the buyer?
- He let me think he worked here.

414
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,791
[Myles] It is work being me.

415
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:41,041
And you can't just show up and decide
to buy a castle, like some hamburger.

416
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:44,458
- Well, you did say it was a drive-through.
- I'm not selling to her.

417
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,083
Mr. Dunbar.

418
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:47,791
Technically it's "Duke."

419
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,416
Uh, Myles is the 12th Duke of Dunbar.

420
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:54,125
Oh, well, forgive me, Your Highness.

421
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,500
Technically, it's "Your Grace."

422
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,000
- [exhales] Ah!
- [gunshot]

423
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,291
[gunshot]

424
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:04,750
I can think
of a few other names I'd call you.

425
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,291
And you wouldn't be the first.

426
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:10,291
And FYI,

427
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,666
the title does not come with the land.

428
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:16,666
So if that's what you're after,
you can buy a ladyship online for £30.

429
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,583
The only title I'm interested in
is my next book,

430
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:23,625
which I'm going to write
at Dun Dunbar in the library.

431
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm not giving up 500 years of history
on someone's whim.

432
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,333
- It is not a whim.
- Oh my. What is it, then?

433
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:35,250
Do you believe in love at first sight?

434
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:37,333
No, I don't.

435
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:38,416
Me neither.

436
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:42,958
But if I did, that would be
what I felt when I saw Dun Dunbar.

437
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:44,291
It felt like home.

438
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:45,958
Aye. My home.

439
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:47,375
My father's too.

440
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:51,125
On the grounds. A long time ago.

441
00:22:51,208 --> 00:22:54,333
- His family worked for yours.
- Try again.

442
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,958
I thought that dukes
were supposed to be gentlemen.

443
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:00,041
Those are English dukes.

444
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:04,041
Well... [chuckles]

445
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:05,875
...this was clearly a mistake.

446
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:07,375
- Yes, it was.
- Thank you.

447
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:10,208
- You're welcome.
- Not you. Him.

448
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:12,291
[Myles groans]

449
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:19,833
You realize you just
handed over Dun Dunbar to the bank?

450
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,916
[gunshot]

451
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:28,458
What can I get you?

452
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,250
What do you, uh, recommend

453
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:33,625
to obliterate the memory of the most
awful, arrogant person you've ever met?

454
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:35,791
- Got just the thing.
- Mm.

455
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:37,958
[door closes]

456
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:39,916
Thank you.

457
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:43,208
[sniffs]

458
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,291
Ah.

459
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,250
[groans]

460
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:51,458
Whiskey. Large.

461
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,958
You'll keep Thomas on.

462
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,750
What?

463
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:00,750
He's lived here his whole life.

464
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,333
I've had a change of heart.

465
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:04,250
Oh, so you actually have one.

466
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:07,500
If I agree to this, there are conditions.

467
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:10,833
Ninety-day escrow till Christmas.

468
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,500
Deposit's non-refundable.

469
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:15,208
- What else?
- You'll move in now.

470
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:17,041
- Now?
- Aye.

471
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,875
- Are you moving out?
- [chuckles] No.

472
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:22,041
[scoffs, chuckles]

473
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,625
I am not living with you.

474
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:29,416
Look, this has nothing
to do with you and me.

475
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,125
There is no you and me.

476
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:35,125
Exactly. If I'm gonna sell the old girl,
I need to know you can take care of her.

477
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:37,458
And you need to know how hard that is.

478
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:41,916
Dun Dunbar is a living, breathing thing.

479
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,708
She needs constant attention,

480
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:47,083
or she'll crumble
like an oatcake in the rain.

481
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:51,083
[Myles exhales]

482
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,833
Gift shop?

483
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:03,750
Two quid. I'll throw it into the deal.

484
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:12,000
She'll realize the mistake she made
and be gone in a week.

485
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:14,875
Meanwhile, her deposit
will get us through spring,

486
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:17,291
and I'll figure out something after that.

487
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:21,541
- And if she doesn't leave?
- Oh, she'll leave.

488
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:25,541
I'll make her life so miserable
she'll never want to see a castle again.

489
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:29,541
Aye. Well, you do have a knack
of driving people away.

490
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,458
You're still here.

491
00:25:31,541 --> 00:25:35,791
Aye, but you pay me. Barely.
Besides, who else would put up with you?

492
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:39,250
- [laughter]
- To women buying castles.

493
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:41,166
To all of us.

494
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,750
- [all] Cheers!
- [laughing]

495
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:45,041
"Slainte" is what we say in Scotland.

496
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:47,541
Slainte. Okay, here goes. Oh.

497
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:50,000
- Mm.
- [Helen] Oh!

498
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:53,708
<i>Wait, wait. I thought you said
you were buying a castle.</i> [chuckles]

499
00:25:53,791 --> 00:25:55,000
I did.

500
00:25:55,083 --> 00:25:56,208
<i>Mom, are you drunk?</i>

501
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:59,708
Oh! Not anymore. I'm buying Dun Dunbar.

502
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:01,291
<i>Why?</i>

503
00:26:01,916 --> 00:26:03,500
Oh, I... I can't explain it.

504
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,083
Um, except for the fact
that I think he would want me to.

505
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:11,875
I can almost picture his face when I walk
through that door with the key.

506
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:12,791
<i>Aw.</i>

507
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:15,333
<i>I haven't seen you smile like this
in a really long time.</i>

508
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:18,583
[chuckles] I know.
It's like it was meant to be.

509
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:21,625
Although I have to live with him
till Christmas.

510
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:23,250
<i>Him? Who's him?</i>

511
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,500
[Scottish music playing]

512
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:42,000
[exhales] Thank you, Eamon.

513
00:26:42,541 --> 00:26:44,708
- [Hamish barking]
- Oh, Hamish! [laughs]

514
00:26:44,791 --> 00:26:46,250
Hi, big boy.

515
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,000
[Sophie laughs]

516
00:26:49,916 --> 00:26:51,291
Shall I announce you?

517
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:52,958
- Really?
- Oh, aye.

518
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:55,791
[shouts] She's here!

519
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:09,916
- Hello.
- Hello.

520
00:27:10,791 --> 00:27:13,583
Here. The key to my castle.

521
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,083
Now you get the real tour.

522
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:19,041
The £20 version wasn't real?

523
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,250
Before we get started,

524
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:25,041
you should know, here on the estate,
we have a community-owned wind farm

525
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:27,416
where we create 70% of our energy.

526
00:27:27,916 --> 00:27:31,666
We also have sustainable forestry
and organic farming.

527
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,541
I'm an environmental engineer.

528
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:37,166
[clicks tongue] Four years at Oxford,
two years Cambridge.

529
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,791
Oxford and Cambridge.

530
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:42,875
Mm.

531
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:49,250
Linen closet, water closet.

532
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:52,291
- Maybe I need a map.
- Gift shop, £5.

533
00:27:52,375 --> 00:27:53,541
King James.

534
00:27:54,291 --> 00:27:58,666
And this here is Flemish, 16th century.

535
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:03,875
And through here, my room.

536
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:07,958
I will have no reason to go in there.

537
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:09,791
We agree on that.

538
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:13,958
More rooms. No power, leaky roof.

539
00:28:14,916 --> 00:28:16,958
This one's nice.

540
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:18,333
[exhales]

541
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:21,791
The fifth duke died in here,
in that very bed.

542
00:28:22,791 --> 00:28:23,958
Horrible death.

543
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:25,458
Ugh.

544
00:28:26,416 --> 00:28:29,000
[Myles] There's a reason
they set horror movies in castles.

545
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:33,583
It leaks after every rain,
and it rains 150 days a year.

546
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:38,000
Plumbing's intermittent,
60 fireplaces half work,

547
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,041
Wi-Fi is iffy,

548
00:28:40,541 --> 00:28:42,083
cell signal's worse.

549
00:28:42,916 --> 00:28:44,708
But there's running water?

550
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:46,958
- [Myles] Aye, it runs.
- [water dripping]

551
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,375
Oh, by the way,
we don't heat the upstairs.

552

[shivers]

553
00:28:57,583 --> 00:28:58,666
Too costly.

554
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,041
This way.

555
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:05,750
So, you'll stay in this one.

556
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:07,583
[groans]

557
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:10,375
[scoffs] Are you sure the duke
didn't die in this room,

558
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:12,208
and he's still in here somewhere?

559
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:13,291
Oh!

Is this room not up to your standards?

562
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:18,208
Is there a closet?

563
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:19,291
There's a chair.

564
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:20,958
Bathroom?

565
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:22,166
It's down the hall.

566
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:25,041
Fireplace doesn't work though.

567
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:28,041
I'll take it.

568
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:29,125
Good.

569
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:32,958
Oh, by the way, I looked up your family.

570
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:35,708
There's no Brown in the records.

571
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:39,458
- That's my married name.
- Oh, you're married, then?

572
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:40,541
Divorced.

573
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:43,916
Aye, now that I can believe.

574
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:48,708
Leaving so soon?

575

576

Take a look at that.

577
00:30:00,916 --> 00:30:02,333
[Myles] What is that?

578
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:03,916
My father.

579
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,708
"McGu" is your father's name?

581
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:09,833
McGuinty.
He got caught before he could finish.

582
00:30:10,416 --> 00:30:13,916
Didn't think there was anything here
I hadn't seen. When was this?

583
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:17,541
Sixty years ago. He was a kid.

584
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:19,583
He snuck in and made it upstairs.

585
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:22,208
He just wanted
someone to know he got inside.

586
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,291
But some heartless stuffed shirt
tossed him out and fired his father.

587
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:31,833
- Aye, that would've been my grandfather.
- Sorry.

588
00:30:31,916 --> 00:30:33,500

McGuinty, it's a strong name.

00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:20,625
Come on, then, slow coaches.

695
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:23,166
[Helen] That will be lovely
up there in that room.

696
00:36:24,041 --> 00:36:27,500
[Maisie] Ah, yeah, we're right behind you,
Speedy Gonzales. I see you running off.

697
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:30,166
[Helen] Dinna hang back.
Knitters to the rescue.

698
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:32,041
[music continues]

699
00:36:38,416 --> 00:36:42,625
- I've never been up the stairs before.
- Well, it's clear you haven't missed much.

700
00:36:42,708 --> 00:36:44,375
[laughter]

701
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:45,791
This is perfect.

702
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:49,541
- Not as perfect as my hair.
- I have to admit, it does suit you.

703
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:54,041
Well, this is looking rather nice.

704
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:55,125
Is it?

705
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,333
Where's the Scotch dresser? And the lamps?

706
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,416
- I haven't the slightest.
- [Maisie] Hm.

707
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,250
Maybe your memory's fading.

708
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:04,583
No. I remember everything.

709
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:13,583
- Okay, what's with you two?
- [exhales] Nothing.

710
00:37:13,666 --> 00:37:15,666
Oh, that's been going on forever.

711
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:17,541
And?

712
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:18,666
[exhales]

713
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:22,458
Maybe we dated for a bit
before I married Sean.

714
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:25,041
Well, you're not married now, are you?

715
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:26,125
Psh!

716
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Thank you.

717
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:31,083
Oh, I don't know how to thank you.

718
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:34,208
Not necessary.
We knitters look after each other.

719
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:37,041
No one crosses the knitters. Right, Angus?

720
00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:39,458
[all laughing]

721
00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:43,500
You know, I've known Myles my whole life.

722
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:47,000
After you get past that upper crust,
he's got a good heart.

723
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:49,791
- [scoffs]
- It might be hard to see right now.

724
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:54,375
You couldn't find a better landlord.
That's for certain.

725
00:37:54,458 --> 00:37:55,458
Landlord?

726
00:37:55,958 --> 00:37:59,583
My family has been tenants
on the Dunbar land for generations.

727
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:00,791
Mine too.

728
00:38:03,708 --> 00:38:06,250
The 11th duke squandered
what remained of the family money,

729
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:08,791
left Myles with an empty title,

730
00:38:08,875 --> 00:38:12,041
a mountain of debt,
and the whole village counting on him.

731
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:13,958
The whole village?

732
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,791
It's the reason he's selling the castle.

733
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:19,666
So he can pay off
the debt on the farmlands.

734
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:22,375
That way, whatever happens,

735
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:24,375
we'll all have a place to live. Hm.

736
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:26,458
Hm. Except him.

737
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:35,166
[breathes deeply]

738
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,916
Come after finals.
We can have Christmas here.

739
00:38:38,541 --> 00:38:39,541
[Lexi] <i>Oh.</i>

740
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,458
<i>Mom, Dad didn't tell you.</i>

741
00:38:42,541 --> 00:38:43,916
Dad didn't tell me what?

742
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,625
He's marrying what's-her-name
on Christmas.

743
00:38:50,916 --> 00:38:52,416
Well, good for them.

744
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,833
<i>I... I told him I'd go,
but I really don't have to.</i>

745
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,541
Honey, you have to go.

746
00:38:58,125 --> 00:38:58,958
<i>Is that him?</i>

747
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:01,250
Oh. Myles?

748
00:39:01,333 --> 00:39:02,375
[Myles] Mm?

749
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,500
This is my daughter, Lexi.

750
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:07,875
Oh, uh, nice to meet you.

751
00:39:07,958 --> 00:39:08,958
<i>You too.</i>

752
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:11,875
<i>Wow.</i>

753
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:13,333
I'll call you later.

754
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:16,875
Oh. [inhales]

755
00:39:16,958 --> 00:39:18,000
Thank you.

756
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:19,750
[Myles] It's not for you.

757
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,833
The damp air degrades the books.

758
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:25,208
The knitters told me some things.

759
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:27,750
I think maybe my first impression of you
was wrong.

760
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:31,750
I doubt it. So, who's what's-her-name?

761
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:35,625
- So you were listening?
- I may have heard a word or two.

762
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,791
[exhales] The woman
for whom my husband left me.

763
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:41,250
Well, you're better off, then.

764
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:43,916
Obviously, he's an eejit.

765
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,083
That actually sounded like a compliment.

766
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:48,375
It's more of an insult to him.

767
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:50,000
Well, I'll take it.

768
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:54,333
If I'm being honest,
it wasn't all his fault.

769
00:39:55,458 --> 00:39:58,416
I've spent most of the last decade
on my computer.

770
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,625
[exhales] I was married once.
A long time ago.

771
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:06,708
She left me
for someone with a bigger title.

772
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:08,333
A title climber.

773
00:40:08,416 --> 00:40:10,166
Aye, pretty much.

774
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,958
I thought we were happy.

775
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:14,833
At least I was.

776
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:21,833
When she left me, I came back here
to put myself back together.

777
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:26,500
Dun Dunbar's been my life ever since.

778
00:40:31,833 --> 00:40:33,250
Oh, what am I saying?

779
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:36,291
I sound like
a character from one of your books.

780
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:40,583
- So you're reading my books?
- Point is, people leave, we survive.

781
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:47,208
I guess I just never thought
I'd be alone at this stage of my life.

782
00:40:47,708 --> 00:40:49,208
You're not alone.

783
00:40:49,291 --> 00:40:50,375
You've got Hamish.

784
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,500
Come on, then.

785
00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:56,875
- What?
- You're clearly not writing anything.

[Myles] Sheep.

You might know them as expensive sweaters.

And it comes with its own graveyard.

802

[Sophie] Mm.

What are all these?

814
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:30,666
[Myles] Locals leave them.

815
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:33,333
Legend dates back
to the first Duchess of Dunbar.

816
00:42:33,416 --> 00:42:36,791
When war broke out,
she donned the garments of a warrior,

817
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:41,583
came to this very well, and laid
a necklace on the edge for courage.

818

What happened?

819
00:42:44,041 --> 00:42:45,416
Well, she went off to fight.

820
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,750
Turned out she had the heart of a warrior.

821
00:42:49,041 --> 00:42:50,458
She ended up saving the village

822
00:42:50,541 --> 00:42:54,083
and falling in love
with a man who fought by her side.

823
00:42:54,166 --> 00:42:55,250
A commoner.

824
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:56,458
That's beautiful.

825
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Aye. If you like that sort of tale.

01:22:08,916 --> 01:22:11,708
- You eejit.
- [horse snorts]

1564
01:22:11,791 --> 01:22:12,791

[horse snorts]

1569
01:22:58,958 --> 01:23:01,208
I just didn't expect this.

1570
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:03,250
Or you.

1571
01:23:04,125 --> 01:23:06,916
I... I've done things a certain way
for a long time,

1572
01:23:07,583 --> 01:23:10,291
and to have someone come in and just...
[exhales]

1573
01:23:13,166 --> 01:23:16,041
I guess it finally hit me
that I'm losing the place.

1574
01:23:18,958 --> 01:23:20,875
But I'd rather lose Dun Dunbar<i>...</i>

1575
01:23:22,916 --> 01:23:24,000
than lose you.

1576
01:23:25,791 --> 01:23:26,875
You want a castle?

1577
01:23:27,916 --> 01:23:28,916
It's yours.

1578
01:23:29,916 --> 01:23:32,416
You wanna go back to America?
I won't stop you.

1579
01:23:34,833 --> 01:23:36,666
But I can't promise I won't follow you.

1580
01:23:38,625 --> 01:23:39,791
Because I've fallen

1581
01:23:40,791 --> 01:23:43,125
hopelessly and pathetically
in love with you.

1582
01:23:43,208 --> 01:23:46,291
[chuckles] Pathetically? [sniffles]

1583
01:23:46,375 --> 01:23:48,416
Maybe just hopelessly.

1584
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:50,250
[both laugh]

1585
01:23:51,291 --> 01:23:53,625
I love you, too, you dobber.

1586
01:23:58,291 --> 01:23:59,833
- [Myles] Hm.
- You're an eejit.

1587
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:02,125
- I am, aren't I?
- [laughs]

1588
01:24:05,458 --> 01:24:08,458
- Hi!
- Lovely to see you. Have a great night.

1589
01:24:08,541 --> 01:24:10,375
- Tom. Cheers.
- Where is he?

1590
01:24:11,125 --> 01:24:13,458
[scoffs] I... I don't know.

1591
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:15,625
- Nice.
- Ah!

1592
01:24:15,708 --> 01:24:17,348
- After you.
- [Rhona] Catch you in there.

1593
01:24:17,375 --> 01:24:19,333
- Easy on that champagne.
- [chuckles]

1594
01:24:19,416 --> 01:24:21,500
You're gonna have to do it for him.

1595
01:24:22,625 --> 01:24:25,333
No, I'm going to do something for myself.

1596
01:24:25,958 --> 01:24:26,958
Maisie,

1597
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:30,291
would you do me the honor of a dance?

1601

About time.

1602
01:25:01,625 --> 01:25:03,625
[music continues]

1603

[guests cheering]

1604

Ladies and gentlemen,

1605
01:25:38,208 --> 01:25:40,125
may I announce

1606
01:25:40,208 --> 01:25:42,166
the 12th Duke of Dunbar

1607
01:25:42,833 --> 01:25:45,166
and the Lady Sophie...

1608
01:25:47,125 --> 01:25:49,125
McGuinty!

1609
01:25:49,208 --> 01:25:51,333

01:26:55,666 --> 01:26:58,416
[all cheering]

1612
01:27:00,541 --> 01:27:01,875
[Sophie laughs]

1613
01:27:02,875 --> 01:27:04,750
- [Thomas] She's here.
- Oh, good. Good.

1614
01:27:06,583 --> 01:27:08,125
[Myles] Ladies and gentlemen,

1615
01:27:08,208 --> 01:27:10,416
can I have your attention, please?

1616
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,541
Until recently,

1617
01:27:12,625 --> 01:27:16,333
this place was as cold
as the winds off the Firth of Forth.

1618
01:27:16,416 --> 01:27:17,708
Colder than that!

1619
01:27:17,791 --> 01:27:19,166
[all laughing]

1620
01:27:19,250 --> 01:27:21,166
Thank you, Eamon.

1621
01:27:22,125 --> 01:27:25,791
I thought this castle was who I was.

1622
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:29,833
Or maybe even all I was.

1623
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,000
And then...

1624
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:38,833
then, I met a lass
who knocked me flat on my royal arse...

1625
01:27:38,916 --> 01:27:39,833
[guests laugh]

1626
01:27:39,916 --> 01:27:44,625
...and she taught me that we should be
with the people we love on Christmas.

1627
01:27:45,666 --> 01:27:47,541
And I realize that you,

1628
01:27:48,791 --> 01:27:50,000
all of you here,

1629
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:52,041
are the people I love.

1630
01:27:52,125 --> 01:27:53,583
You're my family.

1631
01:27:55,666 --> 01:27:57,541
And so from this Christmas on,

1632
01:27:58,208 --> 01:28:01,500
Dun Dunbar will throw a party
to end all parties for the village.

1633
01:28:01,583 --> 01:28:04,958
[all cheering]

1634
01:28:05,041 --> 01:28:06,041
[Myles] And now,

1635
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:07,708
I am honored

1636
01:28:08,458 --> 01:28:09,583
to introduce

1637
01:28:10,625 --> 01:28:12,875
the granddaughter of Callum McGuinty,

1638
01:28:13,583 --> 01:28:15,125
who worked this land

1639
01:28:15,208 --> 01:28:18,458
and had stones enough
to carve his name in this very castle.

1640
01:28:19,083 --> 01:28:20,833
[drumroll]

1641
01:28:20,916 --> 01:28:22,541
Lexi! [gasps]

1642
01:28:23,416 --> 01:28:24,583
Oh!

1643
01:28:24,666 --> 01:28:26,416
Ooh! [chuckles]

1644
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:28,250
What are you doing here?

1645
01:28:28,333 --> 01:28:30,208
Myles got me a plane ticket.

1646
01:28:30,791 --> 01:28:32,916
Oh. What about your father's wedding?

1647
01:28:33,541 --> 01:28:35,166
Nah, I'll just go to the next one.

1648
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:37,333
- [laughs] Oh!
- [Eamon] Want a wee drinkie?

1649
01:28:38,041 --> 01:28:38,916
Thank you.

1650
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,250
I'm learning.

1651
01:28:40,333 --> 01:28:43,000
Well, you did go to Oxford.

1652
01:28:43,083 --> 01:28:44,000
And Cambridge.

1653
01:28:44,083 --> 01:28:45,416
Oh, yes, of course.

1654
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:47,791
And now, to the McGuintys.

1655
01:28:47,875 --> 01:28:50,291
- To the McGuintys.
- [all] The McGuintys!

1657

Oh, Rhona, you've excelled yourself.

1658
01:28:57,666 --> 01:28:59,250
- She made all of it.
- Did she?

1659
01:28:59,333 --> 01:29:01,333
- She should have a shop.
- Yeah, of course.

1660
01:29:01,416 --> 01:29:03,083
I'll pass them round.

1661
01:29:03,166 --> 01:29:05,000
- Have you had one of these?
- Oh my lord!

1662
01:29:05,083 --> 01:29:09,000
- Rhona has gone mad. She is wonderful.
- Now that is a work of art.

Oh! Oh, it's my best book yet.
Guess we do get a happy ending.

Since you were last here, it seems like
your life has become a total fairy tale.

1716
01:32:13,708 --> 01:32:18,666
You bought a castle in Scotland,
moved to Ireland... Scot-land.

1717
01:32:18,750 --> 01:32:21,166
- It's a new province.
- It's near Disneyland.

or do you just... What?

with that, with her head and her brain.
