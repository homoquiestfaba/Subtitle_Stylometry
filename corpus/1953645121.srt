[announcements continue

00:00:59,825 --> 00:01:02,827
Yeah, honey, I should be
down in just a moment.

10
00:01:02,895 --> 00:01:04,096
The plane just landed.

MAN: You gotta
be kidding me.

13
00:01:29,855 --> 00:01:31,055
Restricted items?
That's ridiculous.

00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:33,158
AGENT: Sir, I need you
to calm down.

15
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,526
I know what I'm
allowed to bring in.

16
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,228
I've read these rules
and regulations
a million times.

17
00:01:36,295 --> 00:01:38,263
I missed you
so much.

18
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:39,231
You're my angel.

[voices overlapping
and echoing]

20
00:01:42,034 --> 00:01:43,868
What do you mean,
flight's delayed?

21
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,237
I don't care about
seeing the port.

22
00:01:45,304 --> 00:01:47,239
Well, that was
Big Ben in Europe.

23
00:01:47,306 --> 00:01:48,273
Who cares?
What's going on?

24
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:50,942
Can someone tell me?

[announcement echoing]

26
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:54,912
Babe, you need
to chill.

27
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,914
Let me speak
to your supervisor.

28
00:01:56,982 --> 00:01:58,183
So why did you
even bother coming?

When did it happen?

60
00:05:19,518 --> 00:05:21,686
Started around
8:30 this morning,
Mr. President,

61
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:23,120
and it's still happening.

62
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:25,256
Contact General Monning
at SOCOM.

63
00:05:25,324 --> 00:05:26,791
He's already
been sent in, sir,

64
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:29,728
along with detachments
from the 75th Ranger Regiment

65
00:05:29,795 --> 00:05:31,295
and the 24th STS.

66
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,297
We've also
contacted USAMRIID.

67
00:05:39,104 --> 00:05:42,507
All units,
I want every entrance
and exit sealed.

68
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:43,808
No one gets out.

69
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,610
That means
every damn tunnel,

70
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,246
doorway, skyway
and jetway.

00:05:48,313 --> 00:05:49,614

Major Hoffman, sir,

76
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:12,236
there's been
an attack on JFK.

77
00:06:12,304 --> 00:06:13,571
What's the chemical agent?

78
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,573
Well, we--we don't
really know, sir.

79
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,341
The Army's
dropping in men.

80
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,176
But, look, sir,
the reports

81
00:06:19,244 --> 00:06:21,145
coming in
are unbelievable.

82
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:23,415
There's a chopper
standing by
right now

83
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:25,316
to take you
to New York.

84
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:28,352
Okay. Well,
you hold down the fort, Rog.
Thanks, man.

Colonel Falcons,
come in.

88
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,732
Yes, sir.

89
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,634
We don't know what
we're dealing with yet,

90
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:44,469
so I want you
to use gas only.

91
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,370
Keep the casualties
to a minimum.

92
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,371
Yes, sir.

93
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,373
Take us down.

Gas detonated, General.

Name and age?

107
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:31,803
Listen to me. This--

108
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,037
This is my fault.

109
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:34,105
Name and age, ma'am?

110
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:37,541
It doesn't matter
what my damn name is.

111
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,610
I was bitten by a wolf.

112
00:09:38,677 --> 00:09:40,511
I want you to calm down.

113
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:44,916
Listen to me.

114
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,518
My name is
Donna Voorhees.

I'm 28 years old.

116
00:09:49,554 --> 00:09:50,922
I--I was bitten.

117
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,024
I know. I know everybody
who was bitten.

118
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,960
I want you to take this.
It's gonna keep your

00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,039
What do you want?
What do you want?

123
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,774
You can't do this.
Get down.

124
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:11,308
I'm an American citizen!
I have rights!

125
00:10:11,376 --> 00:10:13,444

On the ground now!

126

Let's go, people!
Keep it moving!

138
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,651
Did they kill it?

139
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,119
No, of course not.

140
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:56,520
Now take this.

141
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,457
Your right arm,
please.

142
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:01,859
This is
your microchip.

143
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:04,461
It's for your safety
as well as ours.

144
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,601
Now just hang in there.

145
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:11,936

Let's go! Let's go!

This ain't no parade.
Come on.

Keep it going.
Keep it going.

On your feet,
sweetheart.

152
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:52,176
I'm sorry. I think the pills--

153
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:54,011
I said up!

154
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,613
Ohh!
Get your hands off me!

155
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,115
MAJ. HOFFMAN:
Stand down, Corporal!

156
00:11:58,516 --> 00:12:00,517
Did you hear me?

157
00:12:00,585 --> 00:12:03,154
I said stand down.

158
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,989
[heartbeat slows]

159
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,462
Are you okay?

160
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:19,203
All right, come on.
Let's get you someplace
where you can lie down.

161
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:22,573
I see you mistreating
these patients again,
Parkins,

162
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,208
and I will have
your court-martialed

163
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:26,043
so fast
your head will spin.

164
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:27,711
Do you
understand me?

165
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,480
Yes, sir.

166
00:12:29,547 --> 00:12:31,515
We need to keep
these people calm,

167
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:34,051
keep their heart rates down
and keep everybody safe.

168
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,755
[sighs] Come on.

169
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:44,128
Thank you, Captain.

170
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,901
You okay?

171
00:12:49,968 --> 00:12:52,103
Um...
All right.

172
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,073
Steady as she goes.

173
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,177
Here we go. Okay.

174
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,048
Lay back.

175
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,685
There you go.

176
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:09,520
Just relax, okay?

177
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:11,923
Look at that.

178
00:13:13,758 --> 00:13:16,493
So you're a dog lover,
too, huh?

179
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,663
I was.

180
00:13:19,731 --> 00:13:22,700
I have some
mixed feelings now.

181
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:24,235
[laughs]
Yeah.

182
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:28,840
I'm, um,
a wildlife photographer.

183
00:13:28,907 --> 00:13:30,074
Oh, yeah?

184
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,143
Mm.
That's neat.

185
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,678
What's your specialty?

186
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:40,918
Well, uh, don't worry,

187
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,619
'cause you're gonna
be back at it soon.

188
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:44,155
We're gonna
get this thing
under control,

189
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:48,125
and we're gonna get
all you people here back
to your lives, okay?

190
00:13:48,193 --> 00:13:49,827
Can you cure it?

191
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:52,163
Well, to be
honest with you,
we're in the dark.

192
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:55,833
And I'd be lying to you
if I said it wasn't
gonna take some time,

193
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,802
but, uh, the first thing
we gotta do

194
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,537
is find out
where it came from.

195
00:14:00,605 --> 00:14:02,539
Like a...

196
00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:04,308
Patient Zero?

197
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:05,509
That's exactly right.

198
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,214
It was...

199
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:11,849
before...

200
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:17,721
th-the--the airport...

201
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,124
my bite.

202
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,927
You okay?

203
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:38,542
[helicopter blades whirring]

204
00:14:50,855 --> 00:14:51,923
Name and age, please.

205
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:54,558
You can call me Susan
if it makes you happy.

206
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:58,095
Sir, we're just
trying to help.

207
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:01,598
Great. Then you can start
with these damn restraints.

208
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:09,974
Hammond.
Carl Hammond, 33.

209
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:25,889
Your arm, please,
Mr. Hammond.

210
00:15:37,702 --> 00:15:39,803
You get off on this...

211
00:15:39,871 --> 00:15:42,106
huh? Locking us
up in here

212
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:44,241
like animals,
experimenting on us.

213
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:47,878
[chuckles]

214
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:50,681
I'll bet you're
all excited, right?

215
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,312
General, Major Hoffman
to see you, sir.

216
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,313
Thank you, Captain.

217
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,986
General Monning, sir.

218
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,422
Major Hoffman.

219
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,290
It's been a while, sir.

220
00:16:33,358 --> 00:16:35,692
It has, indeed.

221
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,095
Still working
with terrorists?

222
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,830
I beg your pardon?

223
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:44,435
Key suspect of the 2001
anthrax attacks

224
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,904
was a USAMRIID
scientist, was he not?

225
00:16:46,971 --> 00:16:47,871
That's right, sir,

226
00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:50,241
and I'm the one
who reported him.

227
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:53,710
You trusted a man
with all the poison
in that place,

228
00:16:53,778 --> 00:16:55,079
and people died.

229
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,181
We can't
have that here.
You understand?

230
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:59,016
Yes, sir.

231
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:03,120
I trust my men
with my life.

232
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,821
You know why?

233
00:17:04,889 --> 00:17:05,889
They've earned it.

234
00:17:05,957 --> 00:17:07,958
Well, sir, maybe you
could trust your men

235
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:10,494
to use a little
common sense when handling
the contagious.

236
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:12,396
They've been provoking them.
You play football, Major?

237
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:13,830
Sir?

238
00:17:13,898 --> 00:17:15,832
Junior year
in high school,

239
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,469
our team
finished dead last
in the division.

240
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,105
Our coach
would come in
after every game,

241
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:24,108
slap us on the back
and say, "We'll get
'em next time."

242
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:26,510
Next year, in came
this real mean
son of a bitch,

243
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:28,512
kicked our ass
every day,

244
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,314
and you know
what happened?
No, sir.

245
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,816
We won
the state title.

246
00:17:32,884 --> 00:17:35,152
You see, that coach
understood the need
for discipline.

247
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,054
We're not talking
about football players here.

248
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:38,122
They're casualties,

249
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,457
236 of them,

250
00:17:39,524 --> 00:17:41,192
another 150
in body bags.

251
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:42,993
I'm highly aware
of that, sir.

252
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:44,228
And are you aware
of the capabilities

253
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:45,396
of these creatures?
Yes, but--

254
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,199
You know if one of them
bites you in the arm,

255
00:17:48,266 --> 00:17:50,434
puts the saliva in you,
you end up here.

256
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:53,036
If it happens
to tear out your throat

257
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,038
or chomp down
on an artery,

258
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,908
you end up
in the ground.

259
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:01,545
I regret having
to infringe on their
civil liberties. I do,

260
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:04,515
but our duty is
to defend this nation

261
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,517
and our citizens
from all threats.

262
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,852
And that is exactly
my point, sir.

263
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,123
The calmer we keep them,
the better it is
for everybody.

264
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,158
I'll be sure
to brief my men

265
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:17,228
on the proper
security procedures.

266
00:18:17,295 --> 00:18:18,895
That's my job.

267
00:18:18,963 --> 00:18:20,897
And you concentrate
on your job,

268
00:18:20,965 --> 00:18:23,400
fluffing pillows and
changing bedpans.

269
00:18:23,468 --> 00:18:27,104
Yes, sir, and I'm also
heading up the CDC
search for a cure,

270
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,306
and I'm reporting
directly to the President--

271
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:30,974
You can oversee
all you like.

272
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:32,876
Just remember
your rank here, Major.

273
00:18:32,944 --> 00:18:34,512
Heh.

274
00:18:34,579 --> 00:18:35,846
Heh.

275
00:18:35,913 --> 00:18:38,249
Relax, Hoffman.

276
00:18:38,316 --> 00:18:39,517
We're in this
together.

277
00:18:41,052 --> 00:18:43,454
I'd like to start
with the airport, sir.

278
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:46,257
If we're lucky,
perhaps some of
the surveillance cameras

279
00:18:46,324 --> 00:18:47,858
picked up the first--
[roaring]

280
00:18:47,925 --> 00:18:49,126
[prisoners screaming]

281
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:50,127
Report.

282
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:52,963
Falcons, come in.

283
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,398
Where'd it go?

284
00:18:59,904 --> 00:19:04,408
All right. There's
no bullets unless it's
completely necessary.

285
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,243
Remember they're
human beings.

286
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,062
Man, how'd this happen?

287
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,502
Oh, my God.

288
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,856
Sweet Jesus.
[roars]

289
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,892
[screaming]

290
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,432
That's enough, Colonel.

291
00:20:01,499 --> 00:20:03,467
I said that's enough!

292
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:08,505
That is a human being,
remember?

293
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:12,042
That man just
killed four people.
Remember that, Major.

294
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,110
I--I couldn't help...

295
00:20:13,177 --> 00:20:15,178
You know, I should--
I should report you.

296
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,547
GEN. MONNING:
Colonel Falcons,
come in.

297
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,616
Falcons here.
Tell me you got it.

298
00:20:18,683 --> 00:20:19,617
We got it.

299
00:20:19,684 --> 00:20:22,052
Good man.

300
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,654
Bring it downstairs.

301
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,522
Right away.

302
00:20:27,225 --> 00:20:29,260
[wind blowing]

303
00:20:29,327 --> 00:20:31,395
[gasping]

304
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:37,000
GEN. MONNING:
You killed four of my men,
Mr. Hammond.

305
00:20:37,068 --> 00:20:38,101
Who's there?

306
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,474
I'm sorry.

307
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:45,376
I didn't mean
to kill 'em.

308
00:20:45,443 --> 00:20:47,378
I understand.

309
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:51,282
Don't like it,
but I understand.

310
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:53,384
Self-preservation,

311
00:20:53,451 --> 00:20:56,119
the instinct
of every living
organism on Earth.

312
00:20:57,221 --> 00:20:58,422
A computer,

313
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,590
on the other hand,
lacks instinct,

314
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:02,293
and yet we rely
on them to fight
our wars.

315
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:07,731
My point is we depend
too much on technology.

316
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:11,234
Human error can be
just as dangerous, sir.

317
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,236
Oh, don't get me wrong,
Falcons.

318
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,306
There's a time and place
for machines,

319
00:21:15,373 --> 00:21:17,541
but at the end of the day,

320
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,210
it's boots on the ground
that win wars.

321
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:22,513
What do you
want from me?

322
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,248
I want you to serve
your country, son.

323
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,150
Bring him in.

324
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,133
W-What in the hell
is going on in here?

325
00:21:46,671 --> 00:21:50,040
Let's see
how tough you are.

326
00:21:51,509 --> 00:21:54,010
Administer the serum.

327
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,052
What's that for, sir?

328
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:04,054
[heartbeat racing]

329
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,743
Let's see what
these things can do.

330
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:28,311
[both roaring]

331
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:43,326
[chuckles]

332
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,467
Ooh.

333
00:22:51,736 --> 00:22:54,438
[snarling]

334
00:22:57,341 --> 00:22:59,610
Oh.

335
00:22:59,677 --> 00:23:05,649
[howls]

336
00:23:08,753 --> 00:23:10,454
[roars]

337
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,658
[bones crackling]

338
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:18,762
[coughs]

339
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,298
Mr. Hammond.

340
00:23:21,365 --> 00:23:23,300
I had a feeling
about him.

341
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,103
Count yourselves lucky,
men.

342
00:23:27,171 --> 00:23:29,372
You're witnessing
a new era,

343
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:34,745
the most significant
advance in warfare
since the Predator drone.

344
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:36,580
Put it down.

345
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:38,715
[gunshot]

346
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,121
Transmission
occurs through saliva,
not by blood,

347
00:23:45,189 --> 00:23:47,157
so anyone with
a nonlethal bite wound

348
00:23:47,224 --> 00:23:48,559
becomes
immediately infected,

349
00:23:48,626 --> 00:23:51,795
and as soon as
their heart rate spikes,
they become feral

350
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:54,230
and lash out
at anyone in their way.

351
00:23:54,298 --> 00:23:56,232
GEN. MONNING:
You believe
there's a cure?

352
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,168
Theoretically
we can synthesize one

353
00:23:58,235 --> 00:24:00,303
if we have antibodies
to use as a blueprint.

354
00:24:00,371 --> 00:24:02,840
If we can find
Patient Zero,

355
00:24:02,907 --> 00:24:05,375
they may have
that blueprint.

356
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:06,677
Excuse me, General.

357
00:24:06,744 --> 00:24:08,846
Could I, uh, have a word
with you, sir?

358
00:24:08,913 --> 00:24:10,347
Of course, Major.

359
00:24:10,414 --> 00:24:12,683
Uh, in private.

360
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,250
Excuse me.

361
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,822
I just saw a man
in the coroner's office

362
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,492
who had his throat
torn out.

363
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:23,460
That was
Mr. Hammond's work,

364
00:24:23,528 --> 00:24:25,596
the man you
chased down earlier.

365
00:24:25,663 --> 00:24:28,331
He attacked again,
and we had to act.

366
00:24:28,399 --> 00:24:30,467
Both men were killed
in the process.

367
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:34,571
Well, I'd really
like to see that
surveillance tape.

368
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:37,841
Of course, Major.

369
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,878
Meanwhile, I'm gonna
go down to the airport.

370
00:24:40,945 --> 00:24:44,848
With any luck,
perhaps I can identify
Patient Zero.

371
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,316
Excuse me.

372
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:48,318
Major Hoffman,
Dr. Ellen Gordon, CDC.

373
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,487
Nice to meet you.
Would you please look

374
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:53,223
for any signs
of anxiety or
erratic behavior

375
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,225
among passengers
in the security footage?

376
00:24:55,292 --> 00:24:56,894
That seems to be
the primary indicator

377
00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:58,562
of an impending
morphosis.

378
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,230
Start in Customs.

379
00:25:00,297 --> 00:25:02,799
Witnesses report
seeing the first
attacks here.

380
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:05,268
Okay. Thank you, Doctor.

381
00:25:05,336 --> 00:25:06,269
Thank you.

382
00:25:06,337 --> 00:25:08,337
General.
Mm-hmm.

383
00:25:08,806 --> 00:25:11,742
We don't want
to keep you from
your work, Doctor.

384
00:25:13,611 --> 00:25:15,145
Yes, sir.

385
00:25:17,314 --> 00:25:18,549
You see, Colonel?

386
00:25:18,616 --> 00:25:21,618
Men like Hoffman,

387
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,420
all they want
is reassurance

388
00:25:23,487 --> 00:25:26,356
that we're all
on the same side.

389
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:30,527
But, sir, are you sure
we want a cure?

390
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:33,263
It'll be produced
on a mass scale.

391
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,532
Only if its discovery
got out.

392
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:40,170
I'd be more than happy
to keep Hoffman quiet.

393
00:25:41,505 --> 00:25:43,239
He's just doing his job.

394
00:25:43,307 --> 00:25:44,608
He just wants
to understand

395
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:48,011
the canines' origins
and behavior.

396
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:50,380
I want to see if they
can track a target.

397
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,917
I think this
little excursion of his

398
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:58,555
may present us all
with an opportunity
to get what we want.

399
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:00,624
Like I said,

400
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:02,525
cooperation.

401
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,527
[helicopter whirring]

402
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,665
[radio dispatch chatter]

403
00:26:13,771 --> 00:26:15,572
Major Hoffman,
USAMRIID.

404
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,048
What the hell?

405
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:27,651
Major Hoffman.

406
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:28,885
Max Stevens,

407
00:26:28,953 --> 00:26:31,922
Director
of Border Customs
and Security at JFK.

408
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,524
Would you, uh,
come with me,
please?

409
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:40,664
One of those things
got into

410
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:42,899
the surveillance hub
and destroyed the place,

411
00:26:42,967 --> 00:26:44,567
so security cameras
are useless,

412
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:47,403
but I got
something better.

413
00:26:47,471 --> 00:26:49,940
These haven't even
been made public yet.

414
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:52,676
We're the first
to install them
after Dubai.

415
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:53,910
Check it out.

416
00:26:57,715 --> 00:26:59,315
Wow.

417
00:26:59,383 --> 00:27:00,717
Oh, yeah.

418
00:27:04,421 --> 00:27:05,488
That is incredible.

419
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:11,762
You can see every hair,

420
00:27:11,829 --> 00:27:13,864
every wrinkle,
every detail.

421
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,968
And this, this happened
before the attack?

422
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:19,936
4 1/2 minutes before.

423
00:27:20,004 --> 00:27:23,473
Unfortunately,
this was the next.

424
00:27:27,845 --> 00:27:30,881
[sighs]

425
00:27:30,948 --> 00:27:33,616
See, the system
only takes an image
every five minutes,

426
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:35,719
so by the time
it took this one,

427
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:38,722
the outbreak
had already started.

428
00:27:40,424 --> 00:27:41,357
Every detail.

429
00:27:41,425 --> 00:27:45,328
Could you go back
to the last image?

430
00:27:57,875 --> 00:27:59,843
[image pulses]

431
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:03,780
[image pulsing]

432
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:04,915
Wow.

433
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:25,401
Recognize her?

434
00:28:25,469 --> 00:28:28,038
Yeah, it's that
wildlife photographer.

435
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:33,176
Think there's any chance
the camera survived?

436
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:36,012
[scoffs]
You kidding me?

437
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,714
That's
professional-grade
Japanese engineering.

438
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:39,116
That thing
is built for the field.

439
00:28:39,183 --> 00:28:41,184
It'll take a licking
and keep on ticking.

440
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:42,185
You have it?

441
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:44,187
Yeah. I got it.

442
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:45,655
Come on.

443
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,493
SLR's a good camera.

444
00:28:50,561 --> 00:28:53,096
There's 10 times
the resolution of
most point-and-shoots.

445
00:28:53,164 --> 00:28:55,132
Of course, most people
don't realize that.

446
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:57,801
I can't tell you
how many things
get left behind

447
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,836
when people are trying
to make a flight,

448
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,538
as if it's
worth losing 2K
on a laptop.

449
00:29:02,606 --> 00:29:05,608
This is like my own
Fort Knox in here.
Let's see.

450
00:29:05,676 --> 00:29:08,111
Photography.

451
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:09,846
Ah, here we go.

452
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,615
Eh,
hardly a scratch.

453
00:29:12,683 --> 00:29:14,084
Thanks. [clears throat]

454
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:16,086
[helicopter whirring]

455
00:29:19,723 --> 00:29:22,859
Need another look?

456
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,795
I got it.

457
00:29:24,862 --> 00:29:26,529
Then you have
your mission.

458
00:29:26,597 --> 00:29:28,799
I get this done,

459
00:29:28,866 --> 00:29:30,533
you'll keep
your word, right?

460
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:31,835
Absolutely.

461
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:33,569
Your family
will be transferred

462
00:29:33,637 --> 00:29:35,571
from Wards
to a private facility.

463
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,420
Look at this.

464
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:53,223
You see that?

465
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,658
That's the day
before JFK.

466
00:29:55,726 --> 00:29:58,028
Heh. It happened before.

467
00:29:58,095 --> 00:29:59,162
Huh?

468
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:02,565
Look, that's what she
was trying to tell me.

469
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:05,601
She got bitten before
she got to the airport.

470
00:30:08,272 --> 00:30:09,639
General, Hoffman here.

471
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:11,208
I think we found
Patient Zero.

472
00:30:11,275 --> 00:30:13,609
Her name's
Donna Voorhees.

473
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:16,646
Time to go to work.

474
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:25,655
[heartbeat pounding]

475
00:30:32,196 --> 00:30:33,230
Now!

476
00:30:37,634 --> 00:30:39,502
We know she came in
on Canadian... 

477
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,141
[snarling]

478
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,815
Stop!

479
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,158
I don't want to kill you.

480
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,027
[clears throat]

481
00:31:37,094 --> 00:31:38,628
Okay?

482
00:31:38,695 --> 00:31:40,663
I don't want to hurt you.

483
00:31:40,731 --> 00:31:42,799
Just you stay calm.

484
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:46,569
[grunting]

485
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:55,178
Now listen to me.

486
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,880
There's still part of you
that's human.

487
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,651
You understand that?

488
00:32:01,718 --> 00:32:03,553
[growls]

489
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:06,889
Good.

490
00:32:09,793 --> 00:32:12,895
So you're the one
who's in control here.

491
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:13,896
Okay?

492
00:32:18,135 --> 00:32:19,069
Okay?

493
00:32:19,136 --> 00:32:21,704
You stay calm.

494
00:32:23,707 --> 00:32:26,142
[growls]

495
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,643
No!

496
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,614
[groaning]

497
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,586
[bones crackling]

498
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,670
[wind blowing]

499
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:02,879
General,
Hoffman's still alive.

500
00:33:10,754 --> 00:33:12,022
Could you do me a favor

501
00:33:12,089 --> 00:33:13,923
and find out
everything you can
about Donna Voorhees--

502
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:15,758
where she came from,
where she went,

503
00:33:15,826 --> 00:33:17,727
who she might have
come in contact with?

504
00:33:17,794 --> 00:33:18,961
What are you
looking for?

505
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,898
Well, I need
solid evidence
that she was bitten

506
00:33:21,965 --> 00:33:23,733
before she walked
into that terminal.

507
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,968
Gotta make sure
no one else
was infected.

508
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:26,702
You got it.

509
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:27,970
All right.
Thank you.

510
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:28,971
Yeah.

511
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:33,910
Yeah, it's a black wolf.

512
00:33:33,977 --> 00:33:34,810
They're very rare,

513
00:33:34,878 --> 00:33:37,013
most common
in North America,

514
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:41,151
uh, the result
of domesticated dogs
mating with feral wolves.

515
00:33:41,218 --> 00:33:42,352
Early Canadian settlers,

516
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,020
they thought
they were wolfmen.

517
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:46,923
Okay, so we have
this wildlife
photographer...

518
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,925
Right. So she
goes to Canada.

519
00:33:48,992 --> 00:33:50,826
She takes a picture
of a wolf.

520
00:33:50,894 --> 00:33:52,462
Obviously she gets
a little too close.

521
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,797
Bites her, and she gets
back on the plane.

522
00:33:54,865 --> 00:33:56,466
She travels
back to New York,

523
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,501
ends up infecting
the whole damn airport.

524
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:02,305
I uploaded an image
on the, uh, system mainframe.

525
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,941
If I'm right,
it should be our girl.

526
00:34:05,008 --> 00:34:07,343
General, I put a call in
to the White House--

527
00:34:07,411 --> 00:34:08,945
Let's not jump
the gun, Hoffman.

528
00:34:09,012 --> 00:34:10,146
Wait. Wait. What?

529
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,882
We need to get
our facts lined up.

530
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,417
If you're right
about Voorhees,

531
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:17,120
the President will be
the first to know.

532
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:18,321
But, General,
there's--

533
00:34:21,925 --> 00:34:23,960
I think it's time we
called the White House

534
00:34:24,027 --> 00:34:27,930
and let them know
that Major Hoffman can
no longer be trusted.

535
00:34:27,998 --> 00:34:29,899
Mr. Taylor.
Yes, sir.

536
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:31,234
Get DOD
on the line.

537
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:33,002
Get me
Secretary Woods.

538
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,070
Right away, sir.

539
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:36,372
Find this girl.

540
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,040
Yes, sir.

541
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:44,547
MAN: You kidding?
They ain't never
letting us out.

542
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:47,817
They want to study us,
make us turn canine.

543
00:34:47,884 --> 00:34:51,221
They want to tinker with us,
and before you know it,

544
00:34:51,288 --> 00:34:52,922
they'll want to breed us.

545
00:35:15,879 --> 00:35:17,913
This is a risky play,
General.

546
00:35:17,981 --> 00:35:21,551
Great risk yields
great reward,
Mr. Secretary.

547
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:25,121
Our forces
are overextended
and underfunded.

548
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:29,259
The potential edge
these creatures provide

549
00:35:29,326 --> 00:35:33,229
could ensure
our national security
for decades,

550
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:37,367
and the applications
are limitless.

551
00:35:37,434 --> 00:35:40,270
I certainly hope you know
what you're doing, Chris,

552
00:35:40,337 --> 00:35:43,105
because if we lose control
of this thing,

553
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:46,942
it'll make smallpox
look like a bad rash.

554
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:49,512
We are taking
every precaution.

555
00:35:50,947 --> 00:35:53,049
What about the CDC
and USAMRIID?

556
00:35:53,116 --> 00:35:56,319
Dr. Gordon and
her people are
in line for now.

557
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:59,822
But Major Hoffman,
on the other hand...

558
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:08,164
Do we have
the image yet?

559
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:10,567
Yes, sir. Putting it
on-screen now.

560
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:14,003
[radio chatter]

561
00:36:28,151 --> 00:36:29,552
Have you guys
seen this woman?

562
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,855
Perfect.
Mr. Compassion.

563
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:35,991
That way?

564
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,568
Target located.

565
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:47,203
Tranquilizers only.

566
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:48,971
We need her alive.

567
00:36:57,314 --> 00:36:59,148
[panting]

568
00:36:59,216 --> 00:37:01,384
[heart beating]

569
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,588
[heartbeat racing]

570
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,669
[bones crackling]
Out of the way!

571
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:20,403
[roaring]

572
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:22,405
[prisoners screaming]

573
00:37:25,008 --> 00:37:26,542
Subject just headed
north into the park.

574
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:29,011
I want the whole place
on lockdown.

575
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:40,590
She's about 300 yards
out in front of you,

576
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:42,492
headed into the trees.

577
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,302
Take it around the back.
We'll cut her off
at the other end.

578
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:55,305
Right! To the right!

579
00:38:01,244 --> 00:38:02,244
Get us close.

580
00:38:05,248 --> 00:38:07,183
Ho ho ho.

581
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,720
[roars]

582
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,388
Gotcha!

583
00:38:16,092 --> 00:38:17,259
[roars]

584
00:38:19,262 --> 00:38:20,563
[roars]

585
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,935
[snarling]

586
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,607
[growls]

587
00:38:31,675 --> 00:38:33,209
Hit her
with the nets.

588
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:41,584
[growling]

589
00:38:47,391 --> 00:38:48,791
[screaming]

590
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:50,059
Hit her.

591
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,008
That's enough.

592
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:22,658
General...

593
00:39:22,726 --> 00:39:24,494
Patient Zero.

594
00:39:27,464 --> 00:39:28,431
MAX: Donna Voorhees,

595
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:30,600
four weeks ago,
she chartered a plane

596
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:34,737
from Vancouver to
a remote part of Iquani
National Park.

597
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:36,305
It's in the Yukon.

598
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:38,708
12 days ago, she flew in
from Yellowknife.

599
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:42,111
She passed through
a full body scan
in Toronto

600
00:39:42,178 --> 00:39:45,848
before she boarded
Canadian Airline
flight 323 to JFK

601
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:48,551
and landed
at 8:05 A.M.

602
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:50,586
MAJ. HOFFMAN:
Anything off the body scan?

603
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,455
No. I'm, uh, checking.

604
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:55,024
I'm waiting for it
to upload.

605
00:39:55,592 --> 00:39:58,160
DR. GORDON: Her body
underwent complete
transformation--

606
00:39:58,228 --> 00:40:01,230
skeletal system,
organs, DNA,
everything--

607
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:03,265
mutating
into a canine form,

608
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:06,436
at which point
she began attacking
those around her.

609
00:40:06,503 --> 00:40:09,171
Within 23 minutes,
236 people

610
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:11,073
had been infected
with the virus.

611
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:15,812
What we rendered
here is a simulation

612
00:40:15,879 --> 00:40:18,448
of the antibody
detecting, then
attaching itself

613
00:40:18,515 --> 00:40:20,349
to the lupine
antigen.

614
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:22,251
This is what
should happen.

615
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,755
If the wolf host
passed the antibodies
into the subject,

616
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:28,123
then the composition
should be identical.

617
00:40:28,191 --> 00:40:29,659
This is what we
actually observed

618
00:40:29,726 --> 00:40:32,495
from Patient Zero's
blood earlier
this morning.

619
00:40:37,367 --> 00:40:39,401
She doesn't hold
the antibodies.

620
00:40:40,403 --> 00:40:41,537
No, sir.

621
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,290
We've been wasting
our time.

622
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,893
DR. GORDON:
On the contrary, sir.
She's invaluable,

623
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,128
for research,
observation.

624
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,671
What are you doing?
Put her down.

625
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:16,739
What?!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. General,

626
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:19,408
this is way out of line.
She's a threat.

627
00:41:19,476 --> 00:41:21,711
Oh, that's right,
Hoffman.

628
00:41:21,778 --> 00:41:24,179
You have trouble
spotting threats.

629
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:26,081
Perhaps we should
let her live

630
00:41:26,149 --> 00:41:28,384
long enough to carry
the virus out
of this place,

631
00:41:28,451 --> 00:41:30,486
like your USAMRIID
scientist did.

632
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:32,922
This is different.
She's an innocent civilian.

633
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,290
I'm warning you
to stand down.

634
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:37,493
You have no
authority here.

635
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:38,561
No?

636
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,964
What about the President
of the United States?

637
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:44,867
You're only making
things worse for
yourself, Major.

638
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:45,968
The White House
is not gonna listen

639
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:48,404
to someone
they believe
to be infected.

640
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:51,240
I told them you
contracted the virus

641
00:41:51,307 --> 00:41:52,942
while searching
the airport.

642
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,544
What is wrong with you?

643
00:41:54,611 --> 00:41:56,579
General, please,
listen to me.

644
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:58,748
You don't want
to do this.

645
00:41:58,815 --> 00:42:01,918
She is our
only connection
to the wolf host.

646
00:42:01,985 --> 00:42:04,620
Believe me,
we need her alive.

647
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:08,824
General Monning.
What is it?

648
00:42:08,892 --> 00:42:10,726
There's
a Max Stevens
outside from JFK,

649
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:13,362
says he
needed to speak
to Major Hoffman.

650
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,431
You know
this man?

651
00:42:15,498 --> 00:42:17,499
Yeah, I do.

652
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:19,569
Then bring him in.

653
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:23,806
MAN: It ain't right,

654
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,541
rounding us up
in this prison,

655
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:27,743
treating us like a bunch
of damn lab rats.

656
00:42:28,845 --> 00:42:30,546
No one is going
to help us.

657
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:33,248
We have to take matters
into our own hands.

658
00:42:33,316 --> 00:42:35,585
We outnumber them
10 to 1.

659
00:42:35,652 --> 00:42:37,887
It's time
we do something.

660
00:42:45,528 --> 00:42:48,664
[prisoners scream]

661
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,032
What is it?

662
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,402
Ah. Whoa.

663
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:54,436
It's her.

664
00:42:54,504 --> 00:42:57,039
Uh, Major Hoffman
had me do some, uh,

665
00:42:57,107 --> 00:43:00,342
legwork
on Ms. Voorhees,
and, uh,

666
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:02,812
well, I--I got
something better.

667
00:43:02,879 --> 00:43:05,848
I have a full body scan
of Ms. Voorhees
from Toronto.

668
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:06,949
DR. GORDON:
May I?

669
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:08,317
Yeah.
Thank you.

670
00:43:16,526 --> 00:43:18,694
She's got
the host DNA
inside of her.

671
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,029
GEN. MONNING:
A tooth.

672
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,698
A tooth from the host
could contain
the antibodies.

673
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,500
[alarm blaring]

674
00:43:24,567 --> 00:43:25,400
She's bradycardic!

675
00:43:25,468 --> 00:43:27,737
Don't touch her.
You're crazy!

676
00:43:27,804 --> 00:43:30,806
Curable lupine
won't be a threat.

677
00:43:31,608 --> 00:43:33,342
You want to use
those things as weapons?

678
00:43:33,409 --> 00:43:35,044
Can you imagine
training them--

679
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:38,413
the heightened senses
and strength
of the animal,

680
00:43:38,481 --> 00:43:40,049
the intellect
of a man?

681
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,784
We need a cure, yes,

682
00:43:41,852 --> 00:43:43,653
but locked in a vault
in the Pentagon

683
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:46,355
so our enemies
can't use it against us.

684
00:43:46,422 --> 00:43:47,957
Sit down, Mr. Stevens.

685
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:50,026
We don't need her.

686
00:43:50,093 --> 00:43:52,394
You turn those creatures
loose on the battlefield,

687
00:43:52,462 --> 00:43:54,930
and that virus
will spread around the globe
like wildfire.

688
00:43:54,998 --> 00:43:55,898
Anybody who's attacked

689
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,133
will carry the virus out
with him.

690
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,335
Not if each bite
carries with it
a neurotoxin,

691
00:44:00,403 --> 00:44:03,873
an injected neurotoxin
that only our wolves
are immune to.

692
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,708
You're gonna make
them more deadly.

693
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:07,777
[flatline tone sounding]

694
00:44:07,844 --> 00:44:08,978
You can't just
let her die.

695
00:44:09,046 --> 00:44:09,912
She'll talk.

696
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,381
She'll talk to us.

697
00:44:12,448 --> 00:44:13,949
And we need
to confirm the link.

698
00:44:14,017 --> 00:44:15,617
We could be wrong
about the tooth,

699
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:17,519
just like we
were wrong about
the antibodies

700
00:44:17,587 --> 00:44:18,888
being in her blood.

701
00:44:18,955 --> 00:44:21,991
General, please,
listen to me.

702
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:25,094
She's our
only connection
to the host.

703
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,896
She can
tell us where
she last saw it,

704
00:44:26,963 --> 00:44:28,497
where it lives.

705
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:29,631
If you kill her,

706
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,068
we'll have
absolutely nothing.

707
00:44:35,672 --> 00:44:36,739
Go ahead.

708
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,041
She's not breathing.

709
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:40,943
Give me
one milligram
of epinephrine.

710
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:50,319
She's V-fib.

711
00:44:50,386 --> 00:44:51,553
I'm gonna
have to shock her.

712
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:53,856
[paddles whine]

713
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:54,757
Clear.

714
00:44:54,825 --> 00:45:01,396
[monitor beeps,
tone resumes]

715
00:45:01,464 --> 00:45:02,698
[paddles whining]

716
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:03,933
Clear.

717
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,602

[tone resumes]

719
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,772
[paddles whine]

720
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,573
Clear.

721
00:45:11,641 --> 00:45:17,512
[monitor beeping]

722
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,414
She's stabilizing.

723
00:45:19,682 --> 00:45:21,917
Get the tooth, now.

724
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:23,252
I have to cut
into her arm.

725
00:45:23,319 --> 00:45:25,955
The teeth is lodged
beneath her tendons.
Then do it.

726
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:29,024
Scalpel.

727
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:35,697
[heart beating]

728
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:38,766
[heart pounding]

729
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:51,213
[bones crackling]

730
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:53,883

[screams]

735
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,412
General,
we need to go now.

736
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:36,692
[snarling]

737
00:46:36,759 --> 00:46:39,359
[gasping]

738
00:46:50,273 --> 00:46:51,207
Hey.

739
00:46:51,274 --> 00:46:55,077
[growling]

740
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:55,945
It's okay.

741
00:46:56,012 --> 00:46:58,013
What the hell
are you doing?

742
00:46:58,781 --> 00:47:01,116
It's okay.

743
00:47:03,286 --> 00:47:04,854
Shh.

744
00:47:04,921 --> 00:47:06,288
Just trust me, okay?

745
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:08,790
Don't move.

746
00:47:09,625 --> 00:47:11,861
My name's Brian.

747
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:15,097
We're here
to protect you, Donna.

748
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,704
Good.

749
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:28,244
We're gonna take care
of you now, okay?

750
00:47:28,444 --> 00:47:29,945
It's gonna be all...

751
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:33,013
[bones crackling]

752
00:47:47,663 --> 00:47:50,165
I'll be damned.

753
00:47:50,233 --> 00:47:54,569
[howling]

754
00:47:56,039 --> 00:48:01,277
[growling]

755
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:10,953
[metal pounding,
claws clattering]

756
00:48:12,855 --> 00:48:14,790
[growling]

757
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:22,531
[howl]

758
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:29,871
Get QRF rolling,
priority one containment.

759
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,707
Mayday, mayday.
This is an emergency
broadcast from Wards Island.

760
00:48:32,775 --> 00:48:35,811
Patients have breached
the compound and are
infiltrating Manhattan.

761
00:48:35,878 --> 00:48:36,778
They've taken canine form

762
00:48:36,846 --> 00:48:38,948
and considered
extremely dangerous.

763
00:48:39,015 --> 00:48:40,615
I don't care
how bad this sucks.

764
00:48:40,683 --> 00:48:42,251
We've got an IPO
bake-off on Friday,

765
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,986
and I need you
on this pitch.

766
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:44,920
One more complaint
out of you,

767
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:47,622
you--
[snarling]

768
00:48:51,761 --> 00:48:53,628
Got it.
[clears throat]

769
00:48:54,897 --> 00:48:56,165
Mr. President,

770
00:48:56,232 --> 00:48:58,733
we need to get you
to a secure location.

771
00:48:58,801 --> 00:49:00,702
We've lost containment
on Wards Island.

772
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:01,870
What happened?

773
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:03,772
Canines have
escaped, sir.

774
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,907
They're sweeping south
into Manhattan.

775
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:14,083
No, sir.
No, that is not true.

776
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:15,784
He only wants you
to think we're infected

777
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:16,852
to keep us
out of the way.

778
00:49:16,919 --> 00:49:19,188
Now, look, you have
to trust me on this.

779
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:24,126
Look, sir, he has
taken matters completely
into his own hands.

780
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:28,197
No. Mr. President,
no, sir.

781
00:49:28,264 --> 00:49:31,100
Don, with all
due respect,

782
00:49:31,167 --> 00:49:33,068
I will not
turn myself in.

783
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,970
You just hung up
on the President.

784
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:37,373
Yeah, well, New York
City's being torn
apart as we speak.

785
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,041
I can't just
sit around and
do nothing.

786
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:41,377
Okay, Donna.
Donna, here.

787
00:49:41,444 --> 00:49:44,113
I want you to keep this on.
It's gonna monitor
your pulse.

788
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,748
Whatever you do,
don't let it go above 150.

789
00:49:46,816 --> 00:49:49,318
Look, we'll explain
all this to you
later, okay?

790
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:50,886
Monning's probably
got a hit squad

791
00:49:50,953 --> 00:49:52,087
on the way
as we speak.

792
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,089
We gotta get
off this island
now, all right?

793
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,058
Let's go.
Let's go.

794
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,793
Come on.

795
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:01,130
[gunshot]
[screams]

796
00:50:01,197 --> 00:50:02,764
Get down.

797
00:50:02,965 --> 00:50:04,466
DONNA: Why are they
trying to kill us?

798
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:06,735
You may have
the cure in your arm,

799
00:50:06,802 --> 00:50:07,669
and if the General
has his way about it,

800
00:50:07,737 --> 00:50:10,205
no one will ever
know it exists.

801
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:11,840
Okay, look, we gotta
get off this island

802
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:13,308
and get that tooth out
of your arm, all right?

803
00:50:13,376 --> 00:50:16,078
Now stay low, and go.

804
00:50:16,846 --> 00:50:17,746
Go!

805
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:27,722
Have a unit
sent to Wards.

806
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:30,459
Tell them to arrest
Major Hoffman

807
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,328
and Dr. Gordon
on sight.

808
00:50:33,396 --> 00:50:34,963
Yes, Mr. President.

809
00:50:35,865 --> 00:50:40,269
[sirens blaring]

810
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:42,371
[claws clattering]

811
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:44,306
Oh, my God.

812
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:50,179
[growling]

813
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:56,751
General, They're heading
southbound,

814
00:50:56,819 --> 00:50:58,753
heading right toward
Central Park.

815
00:50:58,821 --> 00:51:00,855
We've contacted
the Secretary of Defense.

816
00:51:00,923 --> 00:51:03,459
We've been told
to shut down the bridges
and quarantine the city.

817
00:51:03,526 --> 00:51:04,359
GEN. MONNING:
Good work, Simms.

818
00:51:04,427 --> 00:51:05,961
What about
the tracking system?

819
00:51:06,028 --> 00:51:08,263
We're loading up
their GPS signal.

820
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:09,898
I'll let you know
when it's up
and running.

821
00:51:15,438 --> 00:51:16,705
My God.

822
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,042
The wolves are gonna
tear the city apart

823
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:22,111
trying to find
a way out.

824
00:51:22,178 --> 00:51:24,012
Our people aren't
gonna let that happen.

825
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,452
This is
all my fault.

826
00:51:31,187 --> 00:51:33,322
If I'd have
just come clean
in the beginning,

827
00:51:33,389 --> 00:51:35,157
none of this
would have happened.

828
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:36,158
It's okay.

829
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:38,093
Like hell, it is!
People are dying.

830
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:39,861
Get this thing
out of my arm.

831
00:51:39,929 --> 00:51:41,130
DR. GORDON: I will.

832
00:51:42,865 --> 00:51:44,500
Got a secure place
in mind?

833
00:51:44,567 --> 00:51:46,301
University.

834
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:48,237
It'll have
everything I need.

835
00:51:48,304 --> 00:51:50,305
So how the hell are
we gonna get there?

836
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:52,974
One of those.

837
00:51:54,877 --> 00:51:56,145
Isn't this electric?

838
00:52:00,316 --> 00:52:02,816
MAJ. HOFFMAN:
Come on, stand back.

839
00:52:05,087 --> 00:52:06,054
Now what?

840
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:08,524
We zip-line.

841
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:27,108
[growling]

842
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:31,213
[growling slows]

843
00:52:49,031 --> 00:52:50,532
[snarling]

844
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,277
Okay, well,
here goes nothing.

845
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,545
Relax, Major.

846
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:07,816
I don't think
I can do this.

847
00:53:07,883 --> 00:53:10,485
You'll be fine as long
as you're not connected
to the ground.

848
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:12,020
Oh, boy.

849
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:14,656
[beeping]

850
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:15,624
Just do what I do.

851
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,259
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

852
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:19,160
I'll be fine.

853
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:23,365
Great. She photographs
killer wolves.
She bungee jumps.

854
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:25,601
Anything else
you want to tell us
about yourself?

855
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:32,841
[beeping]

856
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:35,277
No way.

857
00:53:35,511 --> 00:53:37,045
[screams]

858
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:42,984
[gunfire]

859
00:53:43,586 --> 00:53:45,454
Let's go!
Get to the boat!

860
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:49,924
Come on.
[gunfire]

861
00:53:52,328 --> 00:53:53,962
Taylor, shut down
the fences

862
00:53:54,029 --> 00:53:56,131
at the northwest
corner, now!

863
00:53:56,198 --> 00:53:57,566
Yes, sir.

864
00:53:57,634 --> 00:53:59,234
Cut power
to zone two now.

865
00:54:04,774 --> 00:54:06,975
Okay?
Yeah.

866
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:09,244
We got company.

867
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:13,282
Marine craft on
the starboard side.

868
00:54:13,349 --> 00:54:15,150
Shut down
your engines
immediately,

869
00:54:15,217 --> 00:54:17,018
and prepare
to be boarded.

870
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:22,591
Move up next to them.

871
00:54:27,229 --> 00:54:29,398
Stay down.
Hold on tight.

872
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:34,636
Stay in front.

873
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:41,443
Hang on.

874
00:54:46,215 --> 00:54:47,015
Turn!

875
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:52,319
COL. FALCONS:
Damn it!

876
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:04,165
[siren blaring]

877
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:05,334
Hold on.

878
00:55:05,401 --> 00:55:07,636
Mr. President,
Manhattan's quarantined,

879
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:10,372
but the canines
are still spreading
across the island.

880
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:13,141
Why is the gas
ineffective now
when it worked at JFK?

881
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:15,310
JFK was an enclosed
environment, sir.

882
00:55:15,378 --> 00:55:17,346
They're out
in the open now.

883
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:20,749
Mr. President,
they're moving
into Central Park.

884
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:23,184
We need to give
our troops an answer.

885
00:55:28,424 --> 00:55:29,290
We have a go.

886
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,226
Lethal force
has been authorized.

887
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:37,098
Talk to me.

888
00:55:37,166 --> 00:55:37,899
COL. FALCONS:
We lost her, sir,

889
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:39,735
west
of Roosevelt Island.

890
00:55:42,238 --> 00:55:44,038
Ah, don't worry.
I've got her.

891
00:55:44,407 --> 00:55:45,440
I'm on my way.

892
00:55:46,809 --> 00:55:49,010
Sir, we just
received authorization
from the President.

893
00:55:49,211 --> 00:55:50,278
It's about time.

894
00:55:51,146 --> 00:55:52,113
Light 'em up.

895
00:55:55,785 --> 00:56:01,690
[sirens blaring]

896
00:56:12,402 --> 00:56:15,737
I got 'em. Headed south
through the trees,
coming at you.

00:56:24,747 --> 00:56:27,347
[Growl/ snarling]

898
00:56:37,159 --> 00:56:38,126
Okay, men!

899
00:56:38,193 --> 00:56:39,728
Here we go.

900
00:56:40,296 --> 00:56:41,663
Stand by to fire!

901
00:56:44,366 --> 00:56:47,569
[Growl]

902
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:49,337
Fire!

903
00:57:07,222 --> 00:57:09,123
[gunfire echoing]

904
00:57:20,202 --> 00:57:23,171
Wait. F-Fall back.

905
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:28,810
How long
before we get
to the university?

906
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:30,879
Oh, about 15 minutes
from here.

907
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:32,781
We don't have
that much time.

908
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:37,218
Can I ask you
a question?

909
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,220
Why did
that wolf bite you?

910
00:57:40,823 --> 00:57:42,891
I saw your pictures
of the black wolf,

911
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:45,159
but why did it
bite you?

912
00:57:45,227 --> 00:57:47,161
You ever look
a predator in the eyes?

913
00:57:47,229 --> 00:57:50,164
As a matter of fact,
I have.

914
00:57:50,232 --> 00:57:51,867
I guess I wanted to know
how close I could get.

915
00:57:51,934 --> 00:57:54,803
Well, you got about
as close as you can,

916
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:57,939
'cause now you
are one with him,
literally.

917
00:57:58,007 --> 00:58:00,542
I gotta
get us a ride.

918
00:58:07,249 --> 00:58:08,316
Get out.

919
00:58:08,384 --> 00:58:10,318
Go.

920
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:20,395
We have a visual
on the pack,

921
00:58:20,462 --> 00:58:22,497
headed south on Fifth
just below us.

922
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:23,665
Permission to engage?

923
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:26,134
Copy that.
Permission granted.

924
00:58:26,368 --> 00:58:29,368
[machine gun firing]

925
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:42,483
[machine gun firing]

926
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:43,585
Holy...

927
00:59:00,002 --> 00:59:01,770
They're on West 37th,

928
00:59:01,837 --> 00:59:03,838
headed towards Broadway.

929
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:10,979
Okay, Brian,
you better start
talking to me.

930
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:12,513
What did you mean
when you said

931
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:15,584
that our guys
wouldn't let the wolves
pass the city boundaries?

932
00:59:15,651 --> 00:59:17,052
After JFK,
the powers that be

933
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:20,689
decided that if
the virus ever spread
into a populated area,

934
00:59:20,756 --> 00:59:21,990
it would be
too great a risk,

935
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:26,327
so they put
an operation in place
to eradicate it.

936
00:59:26,395 --> 00:59:27,361
How?

937
00:59:27,429 --> 00:59:29,764
They can't be serious.

938
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:34,970
Damn.

939
00:59:35,037 --> 00:59:36,471
Hold on!

940
00:59:36,672 --> 00:59:37,906
Go! Go! Go!

941
00:59:43,779 --> 00:59:45,046
DONNA: How did
they find us?

942
00:59:45,114 --> 00:59:47,548
DR. GORDON: The chip!
What chip?!

943
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:49,517
The tracking chip
in your arm.

944
00:59:49,585 --> 00:59:51,219
Every patient
got one.

945
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:56,925
Here they come. Come on.

946
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:57,859
Hold on.

947
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:21,482
Hold on. I'm going to
try to lose him.

948
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:22,651
Oh!

949
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:33,528
Oh, my God.
Whoa!

950
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:45,339
[horn honks]

951
01:01:03,959 --> 01:01:06,394
[Gunshot]

952
01:01:07,897 --> 01:01:10,531
No!

953
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:17,504
[heartbeat racing]

954
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:30,952
[heartbeat slowing]

955
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:38,326
Let me go!

956
01:01:38,393 --> 01:01:39,493
Get the girl
in the jeep

957
01:01:39,561 --> 01:01:41,362
and the doctor.
No!

958
01:01:47,002 --> 01:01:48,136
Come in, General.

959
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:49,170
Go ahead, Colonel.

960
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:51,906
We got the girl, sir,
and the doctor.

961
01:01:51,974 --> 01:01:53,474
Hoffman's dead.

962
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:55,043
Get 'em back
to Wards.

963
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:56,344
Yes, sir.

964
01:01:56,411 --> 01:01:58,579
Colonel Falcons,
make it quick.

965
01:01:58,647 --> 01:02:00,681
The city doesn't
have much longer.

966
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:14,763
The canines have
made their way south
into southern Manhattan.

967
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:15,897
It's only a matter
of time before they

968
01:02:15,965 --> 01:02:17,431
make their way
off the island.

969
01:02:17,499 --> 01:02:19,533
The 1918
influenza pandemic

970
01:02:19,601 --> 01:02:22,536
killed an estimated
90 million people
in just over a year.

971
01:02:22,604 --> 01:02:24,705
Now, if we do
not contain
this lupine virus,

972
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:27,842
it could infect
the entire United States
within 72 hours,

973
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:28,743
within two weeks,

974
01:02:28,811 --> 01:02:31,379
the entire
Western Hemisphere.

975
01:02:32,614 --> 01:02:35,616
You're talking about
one of the greatest cities
in the world,

976
01:02:35,684 --> 01:02:38,820
killing almost
2 million people,

977
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:40,889
our citizens,

978
01:02:40,956 --> 01:02:44,759
just--just
wiping them out.

979
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:47,461
Sir, if we don't act,

980
01:02:47,529 --> 01:02:50,498
this virus
could wipe out
the entire human race,

981
01:02:50,565 --> 01:02:52,566
and without a cure,

982
01:02:52,634 --> 01:02:55,103
eradication is
your only option.

983
01:02:56,806 --> 01:02:59,874
Sir, the operation
would be quick
and efficient.

984
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:00,909
We take out
all bridges

985
01:03:00,976 --> 01:03:02,510
and tunnels
surrounding
the city,

986
01:03:02,577 --> 01:03:04,145
effectively
sealing it off,

987
01:03:04,213 --> 01:03:06,815
then deliver
the payload,

988
01:03:06,882 --> 01:03:08,917
a series of
fuel-air explosives

989
01:03:08,984 --> 01:03:10,751
detonated
over the island.

990
01:03:12,922 --> 01:03:16,090
Sir, if we're
going to act,

991
01:03:16,158 --> 01:03:17,425
now's the time.

992
01:03:25,267 --> 01:03:28,703
Heavy is the head
that wears the crown.

993
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:35,143
I pray that the souls

994
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:40,215
of these brave Americans
be at peace...

995
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:45,753
and that history bare the
necesity of this greatest
obligation.

996
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:53,794
Do it.

997
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:03,102
[distant sirens blaring]

998
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:18,953

[howling, snarling]

1000
01:04:25,761 --> 01:04:27,028
They're pulling out.

1001
01:04:38,173 --> 01:04:41,309
Patient Zero,
you've led us
on a merry chase.

1002
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:43,511
Time to get that tooth.

1003
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:46,747
I'm gonna make it
my personal mission
to see to it

1004
01:04:46,815 --> 01:04:49,317
that you are charged
with everything
you deserve, Monning--

1005
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:52,153
mutiny, torture, murder.

1006
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:54,855
History will remember
you as nothing more

1007
01:04:54,924 --> 01:04:55,890
than a common thug
with a gun.

1008
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:57,758
That's a sacrifice
I'm willing to make

1009
01:04:57,826 --> 01:04:59,294
for the country
I've sworn to protect.

1010
01:04:59,361 --> 01:05:02,230
There won't be
a country to protect!

1011
01:05:02,298 --> 01:05:03,864
If the pack breaks
the city boundaries,

1012
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:06,935
the infection will
spread out of control.

1013
01:05:07,002 --> 01:05:09,170
There will be
no stopping it.

1014
01:05:09,371 --> 01:05:11,672
They won't
get out of the city.

1015
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:13,074
I promise you.

1016
01:05:56,151 --> 01:05:57,885
GEN. MONNING:
You've got
10 minutes, Doctor.

1017
01:05:58,954 --> 01:06:00,188
[monitor beeping]

1018
01:06:00,255 --> 01:06:01,422
This isn't
gonna hurt you.

1019
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:02,090
It's gonna be okay.

1020
01:06:02,157 --> 01:06:04,092
I know. I trust you.

1021
01:07:03,485 --> 01:07:04,752
The antibodies.

1022
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:06,054
I have to close.

1023
01:07:06,121 --> 01:07:09,090
The antibodies,
Doctor.

1024
01:07:09,158 --> 01:07:11,658
You've got
five minutes.

1025
01:07:12,794 --> 01:07:16,730
[snarling]

1026
01:07:16,798 --> 01:07:18,933
The canines are heading
for Brooklyn Bridge.

1027
01:07:52,134 --> 01:07:54,868
Donna, put pressure
on this.

1028
01:07:54,936 --> 01:07:56,804
Ticktock,
Doctor.

1029
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:03,244

[blood drips]

1031
01:08:46,888 --> 01:08:48,222
Whatever happens,

1032
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,358
I know it's
not your fault.

1033
01:08:51,893 --> 01:08:52,593
How long
for the antibodies

1034
01:08:52,661 --> 01:08:54,162
to react
to the virus?

1035
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:58,132
Recognition varies,
depending on the virus.

1036
01:08:59,234 --> 01:09:02,069
We've never done anything
like this before.

1037
01:09:08,009 --> 01:09:11,345
[heart beating faster]

1038
01:09:11,413 --> 01:09:13,347
Wait!

Donna.

1042
01:09:26,595 --> 01:09:28,296
The vial,
Doctor.

1043
01:09:39,474 --> 01:09:41,008
We have the cure.

[groans]

1045

[snarling]

1046
01:10:02,431 --> 01:10:03,364
Move.

1047
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:11,004
Sitrep?
What's going on
out there?

1048
01:10:11,072 --> 01:10:13,574
Let's go.
They're not
going anywhere.

1049

1053
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:36,163
Donna, can you sit up?

1054
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:44,305
I don't know
how we're gonna
get out of here.

1055
01:10:46,207 --> 01:10:48,807
[clattering]

1056
01:10:56,485 --> 01:10:57,151
Brian.

1057
01:10:57,218 --> 01:10:59,086
You okay?
Thank God.

1058
01:11:02,724 --> 01:11:04,925
I've got it, Brian.
It worked.

1059
01:11:05,126 --> 01:11:05,660
Great.

1060
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:06,594
Yeah.

1061
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:08,262
All right, guys.

1062
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:09,597
Come on. We gotta
get out of here.

1063
01:11:17,706 --> 01:11:18,439
GEN. MONNING:
You're not leaving
the island

1064
01:11:18,507 --> 01:11:20,140
with that tooth,
Hoffman.

1065
01:11:20,809 --> 01:11:23,210
You got 10 seconds
to come out,

1066
01:11:23,278 --> 01:11:25,212
or we start shooting.

1067
01:11:27,148 --> 01:11:29,016
Kill us, and you'll
never find it.

1068
01:11:29,518 --> 01:11:32,720

1069
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:37,257

8, 9--

1072
01:11:42,497 --> 01:11:44,264
All right, Monning.

1073
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:45,333
All right.

1074
01:11:48,603 --> 01:11:50,338
You want the cure,
you got it.

1075
01:11:51,072 --> 01:11:52,406
Just let the women go.

1076
01:11:52,741 --> 01:11:54,041
You first, Hoffman.

1077
01:12:15,697 --> 01:12:17,465
Heh.

1078
01:12:17,532 --> 01:12:19,700
Get back!

Dog food.

1085
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:25,866
You still
got the tooth?

1086
01:13:25,934 --> 01:13:27,134
Got it.

1087
01:13:27,436 --> 01:13:28,669
All right.

1088
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:30,671
Let's get off this
damn island, huh?

Stallion is airborne.

1092
01:14:12,747 --> 01:14:15,148
Time on target--
one, two minutes.

1093
01:14:18,753 --> 01:14:19,920
We need to get
to USAMRIID

1094
01:14:19,988 --> 01:14:20,821
to replicate
the cure.

1095
01:14:20,889 --> 01:14:21,622
Can you fly?

1096
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:22,523
Well, it's been
a while,

1097
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,658
but I think
we should be okay.

1098
01:14:26,661 --> 01:14:28,295
Sit down,
and hold tight.

Ohh! We're not
gonna make it.

1103
01:15:05,901 --> 01:15:07,167
Hold on!

1104
01:15:33,929 --> 01:15:34,929
Brace yourself!

1105
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:43,604

Brian!

1112
01:16:23,945 --> 01:16:25,012
I'm gonna recommend
to the FAA

1113
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,847
that they have
your pilot's license revoked.

1114

Engaging targets now.

1124

Chew on this,
you mother... 

1133
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:01,835
Ares Command,
this is Stallion One.

1134
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:03,036
Commencing
weapons check.

1135
01:19:20,588 --> 01:19:24,825
What goes around
comes around, huh?

1136
01:19:24,893 --> 01:19:26,093
No.

1137
01:19:26,161 --> 01:19:28,829
I guess
I deserved it.

1138
01:19:28,897 --> 01:19:30,831
Don't say that.

1139
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:33,533
You're gonna be okay.

1140
01:19:40,708 --> 01:19:41,975
Let them know...

1141
01:19:42,543 --> 01:19:43,811
Let... 

1142
01:19:43,878 --> 01:19:46,013
Let everyone know...

1143
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:50,450
I'm sorry
I didn't...

1144
01:19:57,192 --> 01:19:58,658
I'm sorry, too, Donna.

1145
01:20:14,843 --> 01:20:15,843
We have to go.

Oh My God.
We're too late.

1149
01:20:26,221 --> 01:20:28,555
They're just
taking out the bridges.

1150
01:20:28,622 --> 01:20:30,657
We can still
save the city.

1151
01:20:30,725 --> 01:20:32,492
We just have to let them
know we have the cure.

1152
01:20:34,695 --> 01:20:35,729
We gotta go now.

1153
01:20:45,373 --> 01:20:46,639

where's our air support?

1154
01:20:46,707 --> 01:20:48,708

Hello, NORTHCOM,
come in.

1165
01:21:40,295 --> 01:21:41,028
Identify yourself.

1166
01:21:41,095 --> 01:21:43,363
This is Major Brian Hoffman

1167
01:21:43,431 --> 01:21:45,632
calling you
from Wards Island.

1168
01:21:45,699 --> 01:21:48,768
I have an EAM
for the President
of the United States.

1169
01:21:48,836 --> 01:21:52,005
I repeat... I have
a vital message
for the President.

1170
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:54,841
We need to abort
the mission.

1171
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:56,743
60 seconds to drop.

1172
01:21:57,345 --> 01:22:00,013
I have the antibodies
for the lupine virus.

1173
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:02,282
We need to call off
the bombing now!

1174
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:04,284
Move way!
Coming through!

1175
01:22:04,352 --> 01:22:06,086
Get out of the way!

1176
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,957
Sir, we have
an authentic
emergency action message

1177
01:22:10,024 --> 01:22:11,558
coming through NORTHCOM.

1178
01:22:11,759 --> 01:22:13,026
Well, patch it through.

1179
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:18,865
Ramp down.

1180
01:22:18,933 --> 01:22:20,733
30 seconds to drop.

1181
01:22:20,801 --> 01:22:22,102
Identify yourself.

1182
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:23,803
It's Hoffman, sir.

1183
01:22:23,871 --> 01:22:25,238
We have the cure
to lupine

1184
01:22:25,306 --> 01:22:26,406
in our possession.

1185
01:22:26,474 --> 01:22:27,274
Brian,
where are you?

1186
01:22:27,342 --> 01:22:28,976
I'm on RFK Bridge.

1187
01:22:29,043 --> 01:22:31,911
We have the cure
to the virus. Over.

1188

20, 19, 18...

1189
01:22:35,183 --> 01:22:37,351
How do I know
you're not just trying
to save your own ass?

1190
01:22:37,418 --> 01:22:38,452
You know me
well enough to know

1191
01:22:38,519 --> 01:22:40,387
that I'd give my life
to stop a contagion.

1192
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:42,289
Mr. President, please.

1193
01:22:42,357 --> 01:22:45,025
We scraped the antibodies
from the canine tooth

1194
01:22:45,093 --> 01:22:47,694
that we dug out
of Patient Zero's arm.
10 seconds, Mr. President.

1195
01:22:47,761 --> 01:22:49,162
You lose us,
and you lose the cure.

1196
01:22:49,230 --> 01:22:51,698
Five seconds, sir.

1197
01:22:54,335 --> 01:22:57,770

1198
01:22:57,838 --> 01:22:58,638
Abort.

1199
01:22:58,706 --> 01:23:00,040
Damn! I already
dropped it!

No contagious
made it off
the island.

1210
01:23:48,556 --> 01:23:50,257
How bad is it?

1211
01:23:50,324 --> 01:23:53,326
Eastern part
of the island was hit,

1212
01:23:53,394 --> 01:23:55,462
but it was already
evacuated, sir.

1213
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:57,197
We expect minimal
casualties, sir.

1214
01:24:00,034 --> 01:24:02,035
How about
Hoffman and Gordon?

It's been
a hell of a day.
