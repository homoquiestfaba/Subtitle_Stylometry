Dead grandmother's ashes!

170
00:08:23,964 --> 00:08:27,877
Okay, so, look. I added up your title
insurance and your homeowner's policy,

171
00:08:27,877 --> 00:08:29,074
and the new rate on your sub-prime,

172
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:33,447
non-prime, under-prime
mortgage is $52,000.47.

173
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:36,448
You think you can get that to
me in, let's say, um, a month?

174
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:39,832
Granddad: A month?! I can't come up
with that kind of money in a month!

175
00:08:39,832 --> 00:08:43,006
Well, not if you keep puttin' all
that negative energy into the universe.

176
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:44,379
You got to think positive.

177
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:47,442
<i>Say, "I will get Eddie's
money in a month." Say it!</i>

178

Sorry to interrupt you on a
Sunday morning at 7:00 A.M.

194
00:09:34,148 --> 00:09:37,350
I was just... Wondering

Please, please, ple-e-ease tell me
you have my money, Robert, ple-ease!

198
00:09:46,637 --> 00:09:48,626

but I don't have the money right now.

202

00:09:57,941 --> 00:10:00,216
Granddad: Riley! Bring the
suitcase with the money!

206

You're [Bleep] with me, right?
Seriously, where's my money?!

You don't have my money?
I can't believe this!

- Wait! I got it!
- Granddad: What?

211
00:10:20,617 --> 00:10:24,441
The house. We can make money
off the house... together.

212

We rent out each of the
rooms as a separate unit...

living room and kitchen, attic...

how much is that, Vanderbilt?

215
00:10:32,052 --> 00:10:33,611
More than you're getting now, sir.

216
00:10:33,762 --> 00:10:34,692

about... Having people move in here?

I'm tellin' ya, it'll be great.

222
00:10:41,762 --> 00:10:44,329
You guys will love it.
It'll be like a commune.

223
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:48,323
Huey, you'll have plenty of people to
talk to and share all your political ideas.

224
00:10:48,496 --> 00:10:50,970
It'll be like occupy,

You ain't the owner of the house.

There's a bathroom downstairs [Bleep].

You really turned our
