In a blue sedan.

1250
01:18:11,888 --> 01:18:14,223
In a blue sedan,
there's a man in his car.

1251
01:18:14,257 --> 01:18:16,760
- He's been drugged.
- He's dying, but there's time.

1252
01:18:16,793 --> 01:18:18,361
Hurry! He's dying.

1253
01:18:18,394 --> 01:18:20,830
I have no idea what
she's talking about.

1254

Hurry, please!

1255
01:18:22,799 --> 01:18:25,134
This is ridiculous, officers!

1256
01:18:25,168 --> 01:18:26,269
I need a quick search.

1257
01:18:26,302 --> 01:18:29,072
We are now looking
for a blue sedan.

In front of 2700 Northcook.

1259
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:32,776
The vehicle is
supposed to be located

1260

in front of 2700 Northcook.

1261
01:18:34,343 --> 01:18:36,445

We are proceeding a search
of your vehicle.

1264

We found it.

1265
01:18:45,388 --> 01:18:47,523
Good. I need you to
look in the back seat.

1266
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:49,125
Do it now.

There's a syringe

1272

with William's fingerprints
all over it.

There's a syringe there.

1274

I'm sure it has his
fingerprints on it.

Do you see a syringe in the car?

1276
01:19:08,411 --> 01:19:10,980
Affirmative.
We have a syringe.

1277

So what? I'm a doctor!

1278
01:19:12,281 --> 01:19:14,150
I use syringes all day long!

1279
01:19:14,183 --> 01:19:16,886
Anyone could have taken it.
They could've planted it there!

The ambulance is on its way.
He's still alive.

1281

I'm checking the apartment.

1282

Don't worry.
He's going to live.

1283
01:19:26,229 --> 01:19:27,797
It's not his time.

1284
01:19:29,298 --> 01:19:31,167
I guess he's right.

the car has to say.

about our friend as well.
