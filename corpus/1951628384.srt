1
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:45,031
She was definitely a turnoff,
too overt.

2
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,966
Look at her--

3
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:50,009
Obviously, big problems.

4
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,909
Most girls
don't fly through the air...

5
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:54,378
with their skirt
around their waist.

6
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:57,473
Supergirl at least had
the decency to wear tights--

7
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,313
not that l read comics.

8
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,284
l'm more the politically,
environmentally correct...

9
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:03,582
feminist, poetry-reading type.

10
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:05,180
You know...

11
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,690
boring.

12
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,954
l wonder if she posed
for that painting.

13
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:15,263
Great perm.

14
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:16,596
Blond hair--

15
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,330
obvious bleach job.

16
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,736
Too bad it's six months old.

17
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:24,275
l don't know how she does it.

18
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,902
l get airsick on a seesaw.

19
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,912
l guess she's sort of beautiful.

20
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,947
l don't know. Those lips.

21
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:41,494
Lips are supposed
to be a perfect reflection...

22
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,759
of another part
of a woman's anatomy.

23
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,389
Not that l'm a lesbian.

24
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,491
Well, maybe l am.

25
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:51,960
No, definitely not.

26
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,900
l told my mother l was,
just for shock value.

27
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,444
She said, "Fine, just as long
as you don't smoke."

28
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:00,740
Which, of course,
is my main joy in life.

29
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,212
Probably oral compensation.

30
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:04,874
l don't think l was breast-fed.

31
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,617
l can't imagine
where she came from.

32
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:13,351
None of the other kids
at my school are that scangie.

33
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,194
l really wish
we could be friends.

34
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,878
A dog got hit! Come on!

35
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,262
Someone should just kill it.

36
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,668
lt's still breathing.

37
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,908
Oh, God.

38
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,586
You kids pipe down!

39
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,928
Principal's office. Please hold.

40
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,366
Take a seat, ma'am.

41
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,847
lt's a stick-on.

42
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:46,809
See?

43
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,216
l like the ivy.

44
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:53,383
The cross makes me think
of death, but the ivy is life.

45
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:56,826
Sort of the tragic
and the hopeful, you know?

46
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,826
What did you do to your hair?

47
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:04,164
lt's Egyptian.

48
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,635
Cool.

49
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:11,335
What are you busted for?

50
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:15,172
l got to keep
a certain grade-point average.

51
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,613
l'm slipping in biology.

52
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:20,811
You're one of those
scholarship kids.

53
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,252
You make it sound
like Jerry's Kids.

54
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,813
lt's not a disease.

55
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,322
Sorry.

56
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,722
Did it hurt?

57
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,286
No. They used a gun.
lt was really Quick.

58
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:35,357
But you've got this wire
running through your nose.

59
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,629
lt feels like a booger.

60
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:40,831
Who's the old dude who picks
you up in the pimpmobile?

61
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,375
lt's my dad.

62
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,673
He's having a midlife crisis.

63
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:46,267
My name's Sylvie Cooper.

64
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,710
What did they nail you for?

65
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,614
l phoned in a bomb threat
to KTVM.

66
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:58,686
You know that lame guy
who does the editorials?

67
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,191
He said that teenagers
are too hormonally imbalanced...

68
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,761
to have driver's licenses.

69
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,887
He said the age should be raised
to twenty-one.

70
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:07,261
How did they know it was you?

71
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,857
Wait a sec.

72
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,298
l've seen your dad.
He is that guy...

73
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:15,773
that jerk on TV who does
those tweaked editorials.

74
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,968
You phoned in a bomb threat
to your own father?

75
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,315
That's great.

76
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,976
No, l mean it.

77
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,310
l'm gonna break this
to you real slow.

78
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,547
Your dad's an asshole.

79
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,236
l ought to slap you good.

80
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:52,274
You can't put two hundred people
out on a sidewalk...

81
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,369
just because you
don't like an editorial!

82
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:59,280
They're trying to get rid of me.
Whose side are you on?

83
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,845
Sylvie, you hurt me.

84
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:07,289
l didn't mean to.

85
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,301
l'm sorry, Dad.

86
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,195
No more than me.

87
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:26,335
l.

88
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,809
No more than l.

89
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,885
You're grounded.

90
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,784
You rich fuckhead!

91
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:40,985
l worked for it!

92
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,927
lt's nice and cool in here.

93
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,603
l missed my ride.

94
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,764
Could you take me
to Olympic and Fairfax?

95
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,212
Just a sec.

96
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:03,947
She's my best friend.

97
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,583
Why didn't you think
of that before?

98
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,551
Come on.
Just this once, please?

99
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,554
Then l'll be grounded forever.

100
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,224
What's her name?

101
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,694
lvy.

102
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,231
Great.

103
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:24,700
Good Lord.

104
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:29,638
Get in.

105
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:33,974
l get carsick.
Do you mind if l sit in front?

106
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:36,847
Sure.

107
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:38,211
Thanks.

108
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,950
Your name is lvy.

109
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,177
Something wrong with your mouth?

110
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:08,873
TMJ. lt's stress-related.

111
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:11,814
lt gives you terrible headaches,
makes your jaw stiff.

112
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,852
Almost killed Burt Reynolds.

113
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,786
Do you have to buy condoms, too?

114
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,859
No, l've got to get a spermicide
with Nonoxynol-Nine in it.

115
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:20,883
What?

116
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:23,826
lt's a school project.
This HlV-positive guy...

117
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,797
talked about not shooting up
and using condoms.

118
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:29,835
lt's not like we're supposed
to screw around or anything.

119
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,600
We're supposed to learn
to not be embarrassed.

120
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,970
Don't worry. We turn
everything in at the end.

121
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,335
Save the receipts.

122
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:52,951
Shit.

123
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,925
Where have you been?

124
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,567
Grounded.

125
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,606
You lost your boot.

126
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,981
lt's my only pair.

127
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:17,237
Your turn.

128
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,942
No way.

129
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,450
Way.

130
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,210
Forget it.

131
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:23,788
Are you afraid?

132
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,754
Come on. l won't laugh.

133
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,794
l got to go.

134
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,266
Who cares about
a stupid rope swing anyway?

135
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,276
What's your real name?

136
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,709
l like lvy.

137
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,440
lt sort of gives me the chance
to start over.

138
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,420
lt's so beautiful.

139
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,255
Where did you get it?

140
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,623
From my dad.

141
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:06,824
He must really love you.

142
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:09,730
He also feels guilty.

143
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:10,995
l was adopted.

144
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:17,602
My biological father was black.
You can tell by my hair.

145
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,974
My mom is my real mom...

146
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,271
but when Darryl married her...

147
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:23,712
he adopted me.

148
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,977
l'm pretty sure
it was to make her happy.

149
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,720
l think
he really cares about you.

150
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,914
My dad didn't want me
anywhere around.

151
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,856
He'd get pissed if you
tried to talk to him.

152
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,860
He'd throw stuff at me,
like food or spitballs.

153
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,661
Your dad read "Hustler"?

154
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,360
l don't think so.

155
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,266
One day l went through his room,
and l found all this stuff.

156
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:47,736
He had, like,
five hundred magazines...

157
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:51,334
of the kind with the chicks
and the high heels...

158
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:55,811
like they look like
they're ready for a...exam.

159
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,542
Sordid. Come on.

160
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,218
l bet that's why
you look so sexy...

161
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,185
so that your dad
would notice you.

162
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,688
Thank you, Doctor.

163
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,223
Did it work?

164
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,851
He left anyway.

165
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,628
l tried to commit suicide once.
See?

166
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,702
-Where?
-There.

167
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,599
Used to be a lot worse.

168
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,840
ls my hair thing covered up?

169
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,408
Yeah. Why?

170
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,204
My parents.

171
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:28,212
l tried to convince them
it was female pattern balding--

172
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,782
that my hair fell out
in the shape of an eye--

173
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,817
but l don't think
they really bought it.

174
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:40,414
lt's too big.
You can never find anyone.

175
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:46,759
How you getting home?

176
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,424
Hitch.

177
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,401
Not everybody gets to go home
in a Mercedes.

178
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,870
Maybe l'll see you around.

179
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,944
l don't really have
many friends.

180
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,613
Me, neither.

181
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:07,277
Well, yeah, any friends.

182
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:10,822
Yeah. Everybody hates me.

183
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:13,289
Everybody hates me, too.

184
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,358
Do you want to come over?

185
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,701
We kind of have to be Quiet.

186
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:26,829
My mom sleeps a lot.
She's got emphysema.

187
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,873
l think it's to get attention.

188
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:30,875
She spends her life dying.

189
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:33,937
Do you got any booze?

190
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,742
No. My dad--glug, glug, glug.

191
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,784
-Fred, Quiet!
-Hiya, puppy.

192
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:42,810
He really only likes me.
lt's this weird loyalty thing.

193
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:44,014
You home?

194
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,656
Yeah. They canceled.

195
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:47,783
Head Start.

196
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:51,829
l teach reading a couple nights
a week to inner city kids.

197
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,764
That's mighty white of you.

198
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:55,959
Watch it.

199
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,830
This is great.

200
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,613
Sorry.

201
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,875
l like pianos.

202
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:20,315
lf l was to kill myself,
l'd like to fall--

203
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:24,396
just close my eyes
and pretend l was flying.

204
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,762
With a big splat at the end.

205
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,629
You wouldn't feel it.

206
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:31,703
But everybody'd stand around
looking at your insides.

207
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:35,933
lt's a lot faster
than slashing your wrists.

208
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,869
Who slashed their wrists?

209
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,840
This is my mom Georgie.

210
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:43,937
Hi there, Georg--

211
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,983
Did she tell you
she slashed her wrists?

212
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,617
Oh, Sylvia.

213
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:53,884
l'll be right back.

214
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,597
Hand me the Percodan.

215
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,212
You never stop testing, do you?

216
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,777
What kind of girl
is impressed by suicide?

217
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:21,543
l like her.

218
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,255
She has a hole in her nose.

219
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,948
A lot of girls do.

220
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:29,953
Leave it open.

221
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,696
lt's supposed to rain tonight.

222
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:34,322
Then open it wider.

223
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:38,268
l'd think you'd be embarrassed.

224
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:39,371
What?

225
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,837
Getting caught lying
all the time.

226
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,574
Did you tell her
you're black, too?

227
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,805
You don't want me
to have any friends, do you?

228
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:51,781
People you have to lie to
aren't worth your friendship.

229
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,919
When l'm gone...

230
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:59,382
you can play your music
as loud as you want.

231
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,186
Your dad can turn this room
into a study...

232
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,995
with dead animals on the wall...

233
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,519
but in the meantime...

234
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,621
you are not
hanging out with a girl...

235
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:10,498
who has a naked woman
with a sword on her back.

236
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:12,832
What do you think
that says to the boys?

237
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:15,338
"Try it, buddy,
and l'll cut your dick off"?

238
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,735
l'm causing a problem, right?

239
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,680
-That's OK.
-Wait.

240
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,652
l don't think your mom
wants me here now.

241
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:31,984
l want you here.

242
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,748
She's sick.
lt makes her act crazy.

243
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,351
She just cares about you.

244
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,226
Maybe l'll see you at school.

245
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,865
Do you go to Oakhurst, too?

246
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:45,937
Yeah. She has a scholarship.

247
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:51,242
l know.
l'm kind of out of place there.

248
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,004
l'm always out of place...

249
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,641
especially here.

250
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,716
Your home is really beautiful.

251
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:01,616
Coop's the first girl l've met
in the city that l can talk to.

252
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,711
She's a good person.

253
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,149
lt's blocked.

254
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,595
Where do you live?

255
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:15,929
My aunt gets money
for letting me stay there.

256
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:18,934
l get the picture.

257
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,931
Here. Let me.

258
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,538
What are you doing?

259
00:17:27,946 --> 00:17:29,641
lt was too low.

260
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:30,908
Try it now.

261
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:33,750
Aren't you afraid?

262
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:34,910
Of what?

263
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:38,721
Catching death.

264
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,382
Oh, Mom.

265
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:43,326
Energy never dies.

266
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:44,919
lt just changes form.

267
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,761
You see if you're ready
to change form...

268
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,562
when you're
thirty-eight years old.

269
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:57,672
Well, my mom died
in her forties...

270
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,437
but she was dead
way before that.

271
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:02,203
She only pretended to be alive.

272
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:08,209
She was coked out all the time,
looking out windows.

273
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,585
Every shadow was a cop
or a dealer she owed.

274
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:15,655
She was always asking
if l heard noises.

275
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,699
And she flinched
every time l touched her.

276
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,963
Even for a hug.

277
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,710
l bet you drove it with
the top down even in the rain.

278
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:45,550
Best time.

279
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:54,695
l hope that when l die
l'll have owned a sports car...

280
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,961
had a family...

281
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,664
a home.

282
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,601
Mom died an old lady who never
did anything with the top down.

283
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:13,584
One day with the top down is
better than a lifetime in a box.

284
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,892
Groucho said he wouldn't
belong to any club...

285
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,723
that would have him as a member.

286
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,696
l know what he meant,
but with lvy it was different.

287
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:28,891
Her acceptance didn't make me
think less of her.

288
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:31,793
lt made me think more of me.

289
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,737
At first,
we wandered around, shopped.

290
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,741
We developed an unspoken
division of labor--

291
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,277
she bought, l paid.

292
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:43,348
l got my first skintight
red leather miniskirt.

293
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:44,980
Of course, it wasn't for me.

294
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:53,849
Over the next couple of weeks,
lvy sort of moved in.

295
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,586
No one seemed to mind.

296
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,254
My parents just got used
to having her around.

297
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,297
lvy's aunt was in heaven.

298
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:03,230
She kept the money, we kept lvy.

299
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:11,773
Mom really liked her.

300
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,937
l think lvy's energy
was good for her.

301
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,416
lt's true what Mom said.

302
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,908
A lot of people think
death is contagious.

303
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,886
lvy's different.

304
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,785
Pretty phenomenal, really.

305
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,451
l mean, l never knew anyone that
looked that much like a slut.

306
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,490
Here she was--
my best friend.

307
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:41,404
l didn't really try
to slash my wrists.

308
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,407
l was trying to go outside,
and--

309
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:47,478
-lt's OK.
-l ran through the glass door.

310
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,487
And Darryl is your real father,
isn't he?

311
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,988
l'm afraid so.

312
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,323
You look more like him.

313
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:04,759
No offense.

314
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:07,322
None taken.

315
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,842
My mom's pretty, huh?

316
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:49,372
Rare, huh?

317
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,743
Pardon?

318
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,539
lt's so clear.

319
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:59,043
l'm freezing my ass off.

320
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,842
Want me to get a jacket for you?

321
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,181
A sweater?

322
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:07,850
l hear you're having a party.

323
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,290
lt's just business.

324
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,694
Coop told me.

325
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:16,666
She's looking forward to proving
how hormonally balanced she is.

326
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,703
What are you going to do?

327
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:24,307
l don't have time
to paint them over.

328
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,277
Don't worry. l'll get lost.

329
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,410
Can you hand me my boots?

330
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:34,981
Sure.

331
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,491
Those cost
a hundred and fifty bucks.

332
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:48,897
Hundred and fifty?

333
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,030
That ought to do it.

334
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,649
You keep the change.

335
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,377
No. Coop's not here.
This is her friend.

336
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,437
Jim from Head Start?

337
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:38,842
l really admire
your guys' dedication.

338
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:41,918
Wait, l'll check.

339
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,655
The sixteenth?

340
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:49,921
Yeah, she's free.

341
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:51,222
No problem.

342
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:55,032
Great. l'll tell her.

343
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,928
l'm writing it down
on her calendar right now.

344
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,870
'Twist on one half-turn."

345
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:03,167
More.

346
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:05,971
l'm following directions.

347
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,940
Dad, l noticed the Percodan
was out of Mom's room.

348
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,196
Got any instant?

349
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,360
Espresso.
Dark bean, healthy bean.

350
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:35,406
So what's next, you confiscate
her shoelaces and belt?

351
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:37,665
l want my pills back.

352
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:40,267
Now!

353
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:42,277
l'll get you one, honey.

354
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,314
l want the goddamn bottle.
They're mine.

355
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,941
lsabelle!

356
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,647
Turn it off.

357
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:54,384
Mom, he's only trying--

358
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,326
lf l wanted to kill myself,
he couldn't stop me.

359
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,264
lvy, would you take me
to my room, please?

360
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:23,951
l'm sorry.

361
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:30,826
l don't want to go
to school today.

362
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:33,865
Let's do something
that'll make my parents cringe.

363
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:39,664
Come on.

364
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:47,808
You sure you're twenty-one now?

365
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,414
Twenty-two.

366
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,350
And how old's your friend?

367
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:55,976
Thirty.

368
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:59,320
God damn, you ladies look fine.

369
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,791
Could we change the music?

370
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:06,692
lt helps me concentrate.

371
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:08,288
Let him concentrate.

372
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,501
Yeah, 'cause you're next, honey.

373
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:11,831
No, thank you.

374
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,961
Come on.

375
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:16,274
How about a little penis...

376
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:19,641
that says down the shaft,
"plan ahead"?

377
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,209
Why does the penis
have to be so little?

378
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,251
lt's one of my hottest sellers.

379
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:30,753
Usually the ladies like 'em
between their breasts.

380
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,718
You sure that's sterile?

381
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:37,990
You bet.

382
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:45,202
Come on.
How about an artsy one?

383
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:49,262
lt would be like we're sisters,
like blood sisters.

384
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:51,932
lf the infection didn't kill me,
my dad would.

385
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:55,911
l thought you said you were
thirty. What's happening?

386
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:58,915
She's having a little problem
leaving home.

387
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:02,215
What's more important,
death or friendship?

388
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,652
Please.

389
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:06,246
l'm just not the type.

390
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:08,189
What's that supposed to mean?

391
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:10,658
Nothing.

392
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:14,198
But l am? Low-class?

393
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,267
You rich little bitch...

394
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:18,802
with your socially
acceptable rebellion.

395
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:23,774
What am l, just another one of
your inner city charity cases?

396
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:27,173
-l'm so sorry.
-What?

397
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:29,213
That you don't have
to teach me to read.

398
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,941
Must break your heart.

399
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:33,980
Fuck you.

400
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:38,747
You know what?
You don't have any class.

401
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,393
As a matter of fact,
you look like a slut.

402
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:46,324
Coop, wait.

403
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,796
l need forty bucks
to pay this guy.

404
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:54,303
l don't have any money.

405
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:58,308
Why don't you suck his dick?
Maybe he'll give you a deal.

406
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:05,245
Take American Express?

407
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:19,457
l don't think she's thirty.

408
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:22,658
Shut up.

409
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,539
One of those bills is a hundred.

410
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:36,771
This one?

411
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,678
Yeah. l need it back.

412
00:28:58,036 --> 00:28:59,731
l'm sorry.

413
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:01,931
What about?

414
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,605
l'm the asshole.

415
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,176
But you're still my best friend.

416
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:09,442
Till death.

417
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:13,882
That's beautiful.

418
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,442
Get away.

419
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:17,219
Oh, my God.

420
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:26,194
Where's the fucking bus?

421
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:29,630
l don't need no fucking bus.

422
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:31,668
l don't need no Mercedes.

423
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:34,227
l'm in charge of my own fate.

424
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:37,172
Get the hell off the street!

425
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:42,711
Because the only people
safe there are the drug dealers.

426
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,015
Cosmic.

427
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:45,949
Fuck, let's get out of here.

428
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:49,983
They have more firepower
than the police department.

429
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:51,984
-Where are you going?
-Home.

430
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,952
Come on.

431
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:55,322
Carsick.

432
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:56,586
Thank you.

433
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:58,696
l'll tell you one thing--

434
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:00,960
the kids are learning
the metric system here--

435
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:02,966
kilos, grams,
that sort of thing.

436
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:06,362
We're in jail, and we've
put ourselves in jail...

437
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:08,870
while the people
who should be behind bars...

438
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,770
are free on the streets.

439
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:13,309
This has been
a piece of my mind.

440
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:14,901
l'm Darryl Cooper...

441
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:17,607
general manager of KTVM.
Thank you.

442
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:19,910
And we're clear.

443
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:31,353
Can l get a juice,
a couple of aspirin?

444
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,354
l always seem to be
looking at life...

445
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:04,292
from the wrong side
of the window.

446
00:31:21,412 --> 00:31:24,711
Maybe l should bleach my hair,
change my life, you know?

447
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:26,408
Platinum.

448
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:29,783
l think you'd look
like a little scangie ho.

449
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,248
l'm a geek.

450
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,352
You're beautiful.

451
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:38,895
Really?

452
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:41,898
l promise.

453
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:45,300
Do you think
l'll ever have big tits?

454
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,702
Girls with curly hair usually
have big tits, don't they?

455
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:51,331
Late bloomers
always turn out best anyhow.

456
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:54,536
Don't patronize me, lvy.

457
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:56,406
l'm not patronizing you.

458
00:31:56,514 --> 00:31:58,414
l'm loving you.

459
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:02,749
You love me?

460
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,721
l love you.

461
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:09,793
l love you, too.

462
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:24,341
Let's go.

463
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,321
The FBl is gonna forget
about the bomb threat.

464
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:47,898
They figured it was some kid.

465
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:49,864
Nobody knows whose.

466
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:54,902
Do l look older?

467
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:00,641
What?

468
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:03,873
This is...

469
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:09,245
all l have.
l can't start over.

470
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:14,749
You must own half
the Valley by now.

471
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,760
Why do you need a job?

472
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:18,624
ls this party going to help?

473
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,756
They're going to eat your food,
drink your booze...

474
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:24,869
and do whatever
they already decided to.

475
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:27,565
What's really bothering you?

476
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,607
Try it.

477
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:38,372
Say something.

478
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:47,885
She promised
she'd never leave me.

479
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:53,987
Now she can barely breathe
enough to say l love you.

480
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,268
What am l without her?

481
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:43,981
What were you doing up there?

482
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:45,005
Nothing.

483
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:48,947
Just leave me alone.

484
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:16,539
What?

485
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,545
Nothing.

486
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,221
Honey.

487
00:35:31,395 --> 00:35:34,796
Can't l, like--l mean...

488
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:38,302
lsn't there anything
that l can do...

489
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,635
like anything
to make you feel better?

490
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:42,728
Why?

491
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:46,944
Because l have a blank spot
in my schedule.

492
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:48,275
What do you think?

493
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:51,314
l feel bad all the time,
and l don't know what to do.

494
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:58,318
Do you believe in God?

495
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,816
l'm tired, OK?

496
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:07,786
Yeah, well, you know,
l'd like to know.

497
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:09,958
-Not now.
-When?

498
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:11,496
Please.

499
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:17,296
You're sick, and you don't know
what you believe?

500
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:21,308
l know l feel like shit.

501
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,279
l know that the idea...

502
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:27,681
of taking a breath without pain
sounds like heaven...

503
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:30,549
and when you're dead,
you don't breathe...

504
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:31,679
so...

505
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:36,221
l'm just tired.

506
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:47,831
Oh, my God, someone's early.
Tell Dad.

507
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:51,606
James.

508
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,906
Well, who died?

509
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:57,810
-What are you doing?
-Put some pants on.

510
00:36:57,915 --> 00:36:59,439
l got a van full of kids.

511
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:02,185
Most don't need the keys
to get it started. Let's go!

512
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:04,881
l'm helping my dad
with his party.

513
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:06,651
Oh, my God.

514
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:09,624
l must have gotten
the days mixed up.

515
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,752
l said you could go.

516
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:14,194
Thirty seconds,
and the van's history.

517
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:15,287
We got to go.

518
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:16,591
What's going on here?

519
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:18,794
-Hi, Mr. Cooper.
-Hi, James.

520
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,633
-What's this?
-What's it going to be?

521
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,707
You knew.
How could you do this?

522
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:24,866
l don't know.

523
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,714
l was counting on her help here.

524
00:37:31,782 --> 00:37:33,716
l promised my dad.

525
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,915
Great.

526
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:40,981
She's the reason
those kids are even in school.

527
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,557
lf she doesn't show up,
why should they?

528
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:44,685
Well?

529
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,692
Maybe l could help.

530
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:51,768
l think l can handle
taking people's coats...

531
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:53,996
and showing them
where the bathroom is.

532
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,207
Please. l feel so stupid.

533
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,674
Let me make it up.

534
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:01,803
l'll wear something nice.

535
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:03,210
You'll love me.

536
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:06,876
Sounds good.

537
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:16,693
Dad, what should l do?

538
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:19,193
Go ahead, honey.

539
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,696
We'll figure it out.

540
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:30,274
Yeah. That's right. Bob.

541
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:32,834
l spell it backwards--B-O-B.

542
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:37,344
God,
l hope they serve dinner soon.

543
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:40,349
Who cares?
l feel guilty eating his food.

544
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,749
Who's going to tell him?

545
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,583
l thought his kid
had dark hair.

546
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:45,849
Must be a caterer.

547
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:48,356
l wonder if Georgie
will make an appearance.

548
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,359
Think she will?
l heard she's getting worse.

549
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:52,361
You can cater my party anytime.

550
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:53,760
Max, behave yourself.

551
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:55,764
My fingers never left my hand.

552
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:56,992
His wife, remember?

553
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,165
Hello, Mr. Cooper.

554
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:07,506
Care for anything?

555
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:13,645
That...dress fits you perfectly.

556
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:16,777
You look...

557
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:18,616
Beautiful?

558
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:21,624
Something like that, yeah.

559
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:30,657
l almost forgot.

560
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:32,793
You're not allowed.

561
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,297
l'm not an alcoholic.

562
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:37,601
l used to have
a drinking problem...

563
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,608
but since l don't drink
anymore...

564
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,200
this is OK.

565
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:27,300
Honey,
l'm glad you're awake. l...

566
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:29,002
You look nice.

567
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:33,445
How stupid of me.

568
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:37,217
What a dumb,
sick jerk l've been.

569
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:38,811
Honey, Quiet. There's--

570
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:41,756
Which party are you
afraid of me ruining?

571
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:46,019
Everybody's gone home.

572
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:12,789
l was so happy that Sylvie
had found a...little friend.

573
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:19,727
Honey.

574
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,855
Get away from me.

575
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:28,870
l thought you both
could use this.

576
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:32,705
Get out.

577
00:43:33,877 --> 00:43:35,674
l feel so stupid.

578
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:38,983
l shouldn't have
worn your clothes.

579
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:43,443
Everybody said l look like you,
and he misses you so much.

580
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:48,452
l think he came
into the kitchen to cry.

581
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:54,954
And l saw him,
and l put my arms around him.

582
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:00,563
lt seemed right.

583
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:03,364
l'm sorry.

584
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:13,715
lt's OK.

585
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,985
He doesn't drink.

586
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,284
Right.

587
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:42,210
l'm sorry.

588
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:41,979
Fred?

589
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:56,926
Wild party.

590
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:30,800
l know it's stupid
to be jealous about a dog.

591
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:33,199
lt's probably because
l have low self-esteem.

592
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:36,670
The fact that Fred hated
every human except me...

593
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,501
really meant something.

594
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:46,246
My father never gave me
anything real.

595
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:55,983
l guess you give up things
when you take on a friendship.

596
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,692
Come on, Fred.

597
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:06,002
l know you want some
of my special treats.

598
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:12,902
No one else gives you any,
do they?

599
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:20,408
You love me, don't you?

600
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:09,748
Did it work?

601
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:13,353
What?

602
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:14,760
The party.

603
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:18,699
Let me tell you about parties.

604
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:22,701
People eat your food,
drink your booze...

605
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,831
and do what they're
gonna do anyway.

606
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:27,703
Have you seen Fred?

607
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,652
l better get to school.

608
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:48,027
Jesus.

609
00:52:58,308 --> 00:53:00,742
What the hell are you doing
in my mom's car?

610
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,744
l found the key.

611
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:07,248
lt's not yours. Get out.

612
00:53:07,317 --> 00:53:09,342
l wasn't doing anything.

613
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:12,285
And leave my goddamn dog alone.

614
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:13,549
You're kidding.

615
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:16,751
All my mom's stuff
seems to fit you fine.

616
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,191
l didn't steal anything.

617
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:20,593
She said l could
borrow some stuff.

618
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:23,598
You're not my friend,
and my dog's a traitor.

619
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,190
That's not true.

620
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:26,736
Really?

621
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:29,227
Suddenly he seems to think
that he's yours.

622
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,669
Bullshit.

623
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:32,674
Let's find out.
Stand over there.

624
00:53:32,776 --> 00:53:34,710
You know what this is?

625
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:37,279
Fuck you with a limp dick!

626
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,846
Do it. Go! Do it!

627
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:44,886
-God, this is so stupid.
-Call him.

628
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,654
Do it!

629
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:52,953
Here, boy.

630
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,832
Go ahead. Keep calling him.

631
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:10,208
God damn it, Fred.
l called you.

632
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:13,913
Fred, come here.

633
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:17,243
No, Fred. Come here.

634
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:21,822
No, Fred. Come here.

635
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:23,688
Fred, l called you.

636
00:54:24,894 --> 00:54:26,327
Come here, Fred.

637
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:32,732
Fred,
get your fuzzy ass over here.

638
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:40,238
That's a good boy.

639
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:43,743
Fuck you, Fred.

640
00:54:48,985 --> 00:54:52,785
Here. Here's something
your mother didn't loan me.

641
00:56:34,691 --> 00:56:36,955
l...got off work early.

642
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:42,255
l figured, what the hell,
give the girls a ride.

643
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:43,798
Coop's not here.

644
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:50,364
You want a ride?

645
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:53,806
Look, Darryl,
just give my books a ride home.

646
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,343
l feel like walking.

647
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:04,710
Get in.

648
00:57:13,663 --> 00:57:14,891
You're not my father.

649
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:17,765
That's right. l'm not.

650
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:36,879
l just can't...

651
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:39,284
You already did.

652
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:41,550
Remember last night?

653
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:47,557
l can stop.

654
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:52,567
How about right here?

655
00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:53,966
Stop.

656
00:57:57,273 --> 00:57:58,399
Get out.

657
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,207
You heard me.

658
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:08,884
l hurt you?

659
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:11,819
Heard me.

660
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:18,585
l thought you said "hurt me."

661
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:19,923
l didn't.

662
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:31,804
Did l hurt you?

663
00:58:36,379 --> 00:58:37,869
l can handle this.

664
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:40,222
You have a key.

665
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,984
l didn't know
if l should use it.

666
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:55,963
l'm really sorry about your dog.

667
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:00,499
l've never had one...

668
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:03,204
and it was sort of fun
pretending he was mine.

669
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,751
He likes you best.

670
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:17,725
l'm sorry.
lt won't ever happen again.

671
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:32,875
By the way, what was that record
you were playing?

672
01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:35,409
Don't overdo it.

673
01:04:22,758 --> 01:04:25,693
You think about it sometimes,
don't you?

674
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:28,624
Sometimes.

675
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:03,593
Mom?

676
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:13,300
l never thought my mom
would really do it.

677
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:15,769
She threatened,
but l didn't believe her.

678
01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:18,866
She must have really hurt.

679
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:28,381
When she first got sick,
l thought she was faking.

680
01:06:29,885 --> 01:06:31,648
l was embarrassed by her.

681
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,289
lt made me angry.

682
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:37,816
This little oxygen bottle
she carried with her--

683
01:06:37,927 --> 01:06:41,226
We'd be at the supermarket,
and she'd pull it out.

684
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:44,891
Hiss, suck...hiss, suck...

685
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,935
l wanted to kill her.

686
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:50,931
Maybe if l
hadn't been so selfish...

687
01:06:51,974 --> 01:06:54,875
maybe if l could have
told her l loved her...

688
01:06:56,412 --> 01:06:59,404
maybe things
would be different now.

689
01:07:43,926 --> 01:07:45,325
Leave it open.

690
01:07:48,931 --> 01:07:50,228
The door.

691
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:51,731
Leave it open.

692
01:07:57,373 --> 01:08:00,171
You're in my mother's bed.

693
01:08:01,544 --> 01:08:04,206
You looked like you
needed to be alone.

694
01:08:07,516 --> 01:08:08,710
Come here.

695
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:14,489
Come here. lt's OK.

696
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:32,831
Talk to me.

697
01:08:32,975 --> 01:08:34,567
This is weird.

698
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:41,681
l wanted to talk to her,
you know?

699
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:45,220
Tell her stuff before she died.

700
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:46,720
Tell me.

701
01:08:47,823 --> 01:08:48,915
What?

702
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:51,322
Pretend l'm her.

703
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:54,726
Come on. l'm your mom.

704
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:56,627
l don't know what to say.

705
01:08:56,699 --> 01:08:59,293
What couldn't you say to me?

706
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:00,595
Come on. l'm Georgie.

707
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,467
l was jealous of you.

708
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:12,477
When you walked into a room,
people shut up and stared.

709
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:20,951
l was glad when you got sick.

710
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:26,922
l thought l would
finally have my turn...

711
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,759
but l was wrong.

712
01:09:32,201 --> 01:09:33,793
Everything was for you.

713
01:09:33,869 --> 01:09:36,337
There was nothing left for me.

714
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:40,299
l don't buy it, Sylvie.

715
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:43,207
You were never afraid
to get angry at me.

716
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,713
That was easy and obvious.

717
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:48,644
What couldn't you say?

718
01:09:48,751 --> 01:09:50,582
What were you afraid to say?

719
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,721
l love you.

720
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:10,634
The plan that's
federally supported...

721
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:12,001
would ease the debt burden...

722
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:14,003
and control the soaring
cost of medicine...

723
01:10:14,276 --> 01:10:16,244
making health care
more readily available...

724
01:10:16,412 --> 01:10:18,004
to those who need it most--

725
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:19,406
small businesses...

726
01:10:19,515 --> 01:10:21,005
independent contractors...

727
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:22,682
and the unemployed.

728
01:10:22,785 --> 01:10:24,218
lt's a shame that...

729
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,447
What the hell is this?

730
01:10:26,522 --> 01:10:28,319
Tough way to find out--

731
01:10:28,424 --> 01:10:31,291
What do they think
they're doing?

732
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:32,792
l don't know.

733
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:36,728
l mean, l tried to call you.

734
01:10:43,339 --> 01:10:44,465
l'm sorry.

735
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:48,466
This is Brad Daly,
general manager of KTVM...

736
01:10:48,777 --> 01:10:49,937
in touch with you.

737
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:48,503
Let's go for a drive...

738
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:51,666
all three of us.

739
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:55,340
All three of us?

740
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,281
We shouldn't be doing this.

741
01:11:59,381 --> 01:12:00,609
lt's completion.

742
01:12:00,716 --> 01:12:03,810
A final memorial,
the kind she would have liked.

743
01:12:06,021 --> 01:12:07,318
l just feel like--

744
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:09,914
lt's your chance
to say good-bye...

745
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:13,351
and mine, too.

746
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:16,898
They say it might rain.

747
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,661
One can always hope.

748
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:24,362
Are you sure you can drive?

749
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:27,203
Yeah.
This is an automatic, right?

750
01:12:29,878 --> 01:12:31,675
l'm just kidding.

751
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:35,238
l used to have to drive my mom
home when she was too blasted.

752
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:48,830
Slow down.

753
01:12:48,897 --> 01:12:50,694
l thought you could drive.

754
01:12:51,567 --> 01:12:55,025
Well, it was on an interstate--
all straight, no turns.

755
01:12:58,307 --> 01:13:01,674
Aren't you supposed to shift
that thing once in a while?

756
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:05,338
OK, forget shifting.

757
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:17,389
lt's so weird.

758
01:13:17,626 --> 01:13:18,786
What?

759
01:13:20,262 --> 01:13:26,201
A whole person ending up
in something so small.

760
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:30,199
Watch it!

761
01:13:32,274 --> 01:13:33,263
Sorry.

762
01:13:36,879 --> 01:13:39,211
l'm not going to say anything.

763
01:13:53,495 --> 01:13:54,894
What is that?

764
01:13:55,998 --> 01:13:57,260
What?

765
01:13:57,366 --> 01:13:58,833
That song.

766
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:00,636
What are you talking about?

767
01:14:00,636 --> 01:14:02,627
You were just humming.

768
01:14:02,738 --> 01:14:03,830
So?

769
01:14:03,972 --> 01:14:05,633
Where'd you hear it?

770
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:07,174
l don't know.

771
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,540
l do. l wrote it.

772
01:14:09,645 --> 01:14:12,205
Dad recorded it for Mom
for her birthday.

773
01:14:14,016 --> 01:14:16,314
You heard it in her room.

774
01:14:16,418 --> 01:14:18,215
So?

775
01:14:21,223 --> 01:14:22,690
So...

776
01:14:22,825 --> 01:14:24,952
she was playing it that morning.

777
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:27,693
Oh, my God.

778
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:29,661
You were there.

779
01:14:29,731 --> 01:14:31,289
What did she say to you?

780
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:39,374
She was about to kill herself.

781
01:14:39,374 --> 01:14:41,740
She must have said something.

782
01:14:41,877 --> 01:14:44,937
Why won't you tell me
what my mother said?

783
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:50,216
-Please stop!
-l want to hear you say it!

784
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:52,321
Are you accusing me
of something?

785
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:54,448
Why, did you do something?

786
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:57,287
Everybody always
ends up blaming me!

787
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:00,328
l thought you were different!
l thought we were real friends!

788
01:15:01,263 --> 01:15:02,457
Look out!

789
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:48,630
Mr. Cooper?

790
01:16:50,872 --> 01:16:53,375
l know you probably feel
like strangling her...

791
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:55,002
but you'll have to hold off.

792
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:56,437
She's had a head injury.

793
01:16:56,678 --> 01:16:58,976
One of the nurses said
she's been hallucinating.

794
01:16:59,247 --> 01:17:02,478
l want to keep her here
for at least a couple of days.

795
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:04,179
Have fun.

796
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:07,744
Nurse will chase you out
in about ten minutes.

797
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:25,639
Everything is lvy.

798
01:17:27,242 --> 01:17:28,539
She did it.

799
01:17:31,413 --> 01:17:33,244
What the hell is this?

800
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:36,843
That's real.

801
01:17:38,787 --> 01:17:39,981
Where is she?

802
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:43,188
This is unbelievable.

803
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:44,918
l don't want her
at the house anymore.

804
01:17:45,027 --> 01:17:46,927
What the hell's
the matter with you?

805
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:50,597
She killed my mother.

806
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:52,599
Your mother committed suicide.

807
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:54,964
You almost killed yourself.
You almost killed your friend.

808
01:17:55,237 --> 01:17:56,329
Me?

809
01:17:56,471 --> 01:17:58,371
Who drove?
Who took your mother's urn?

810
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:02,435
Just stop the lying, will you?

811
01:18:02,544 --> 01:18:03,738
l'm not lying.

812
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:05,836
l know you were driving.

813
01:18:07,649 --> 01:18:09,879
She's gotten to you, too,
hasn't she?

814
01:18:11,253 --> 01:18:12,743
That's enough.

815
01:18:15,857 --> 01:18:17,586
See you in the morning.

816
01:19:36,805 --> 01:19:38,898
Hey, Charla,
room eight-twenty-eight, OK?

817
01:19:41,376 --> 01:19:43,901
We ought to put motors
on these things.

818
01:21:02,357 --> 01:21:03,915
Nice outfit.

819
01:21:04,025 --> 01:21:06,391
Did you do the blood yourself?

820
01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:16,761
Thanks.

821
01:21:16,905 --> 01:21:18,566
Take care.

822
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:19,867
And enjoy the Duds.

823
01:21:19,975 --> 01:21:21,875
l stole them myself.

824
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:21,956
Oh, my God. lt's Sylvie.

825
01:23:34,876 --> 01:23:36,400
Shit!

826
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:47,012
l can find her.

827
01:23:47,288 --> 01:23:49,017
You're hurting me!

828
01:23:58,533 --> 01:23:59,932
You were driving.

829
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:00,933
She made me.

830
01:24:01,202 --> 01:24:03,261
-She what?
-Made me!

831
01:24:05,907 --> 01:24:07,932
l was protecting you.

832
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:10,879
The car insurance.

833
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:13,882
lsn't it better
if Coop's driving?

834
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:15,543
l got to find her.

835
01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:17,584
-You can't even walk!
-Aw, Jesus.

836
01:24:17,685 --> 01:24:19,653
Stay inside, and l'll find her.

837
01:24:19,754 --> 01:24:21,619
You just stay put.

838
01:24:24,993 --> 01:24:26,187
Just stay.

839
01:26:14,736 --> 01:26:15,794
Mom?

840
01:26:52,507 --> 01:26:54,873
l've got to tell you something.

841
01:26:59,447 --> 01:27:01,176
l love you.

842
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:05,686
l love you.

843
01:27:23,605 --> 01:27:24,902
You killed her.

844
01:27:26,307 --> 01:27:28,673
She wanted to die.

845
01:27:31,012 --> 01:27:32,946
We can all be together now.

846
01:27:34,616 --> 01:27:36,777
We can all be a family.

847
01:27:38,286 --> 01:27:39,651
Fuck you!

848
01:27:46,294 --> 01:27:48,194
l can take you with me.

849
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:30,237
l still think about her.

850
01:28:31,839 --> 01:28:34,808
l guess l still love her.

851
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:39,173
She might have been even
more alone than l was.

852
01:28:40,415 --> 01:28:41,814
l miss her.
