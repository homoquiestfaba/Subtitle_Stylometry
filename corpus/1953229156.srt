Colonel Chadwick sent me!
We got a Code Orange!

00:00:28,494 --> 00:00:29,661
We got a big storm
coming in!

5
00:00:29,728 --> 00:00:31,496
I got a problem
in the pump room!

6
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:34,566
Let's go.

7
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:39,037
Yeah, so sounds like
you got a punch-through.

8
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:40,972
We've hit
a geologic formation.

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,240
Gas?

10
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:43,341
Something else.

11
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:44,543
What?
Like a structural trap?

12
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,778
Take a look.
You tell me.

13
00:00:46,845 --> 00:00:48,180
Hey.

14
00:00:59,258 --> 00:01:00,392
What you got?

15
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,560
Travis, look at this.

16
00:01:01,627 --> 00:01:04,162
We tapped
into some rocky sediment.

17
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,430
It's causing real damage.

18
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:07,265
This is
volcanic material.

19
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,901
Nothing in our geologic
survey shows this.

20

21
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:13,538

Buddy, can you hear me?

25
00:01:21,547 --> 00:01:22,880
Can you hear me, huh?

26
00:01:22,948 --> 00:01:24,182
Hey, is he breathing?

27
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,650
No, no!

28
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:28,886
All right,
start the CPR!

29
00:01:28,954 --> 00:01:30,989
All right,
1, 2, 3, 4...

30
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:34,959
Come on, Bill.

There's a plume
outside the radius!

35
00:01:50,576 --> 00:01:52,544
We don't have much time!

36
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,912
Hold her!
Hold her steady!

37
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:58,950
We're under-balanced!

Go!

41
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:08,593

Uncle Clegg, you okay?

46
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,970
What just happened?

47
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,508
I think we just spiked
a volcano.

00:03:16,795 --> 00:03:19,364
Mr. Winters,
it's Colonel Chadwick.

52
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:21,266
Listen,
I know Petro-Cal

53
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,702
sent Travis Verdon
out to your rig.

54
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:25,503
Yes, sir.

55
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:29,474
This storm is building
too fast for my comfort.

56
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,676
It's gonna impact
your rig in less
than an hour.

57
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:34,346
Now, I have a NOAA vessel
in the area.

58
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:35,980
I'd very much
like my science team

59
00:03:36,048 --> 00:03:36,848
to come
and check it out.

60
00:03:36,915 --> 00:03:39,384
Your liaison
is Dr. Jenna Sparks.

61
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,253
Please see that she's
well looked after.

62
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,754
Of course, sir.

63
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:45,890
We will offer her
every accommodation possible.

64
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,359
Thank you, Winters.

65
00:03:47,426 --> 00:03:48,893
Look,
I know it's not easy

66
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:50,928
having me looking
over your shoulder.

67
00:03:50,996 --> 00:03:53,431
Just try to
remember we're all
on the same side here.

68
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,833
Thank you, sir.

69
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:00,872
This must be
a hell of a storm

70
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:03,541
if sending the big boss in
isn't enough.

71
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:05,277
What do you mean?

72
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:07,145
Well, Chadwick
wants to send in

73
00:04:07,212 --> 00:04:09,481
a specialist group
from NOAA.

74
00:04:09,548 --> 00:04:12,216
That's bigger
than normal.

75
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,851
Yeah.

76
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:16,788
I guess we'll see.

[Thunder]

78
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:32,704

is showing real promise

breaking up
extreme storm patterns.

80
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:37,575
Yeah, and this, uh,
silver iodide research, too.

81
00:04:37,643 --> 00:04:38,710
It's gonna play a major role

82
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,645
in preventing
catastrophic storms.

83
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,347

00:04:55,027 --> 00:04:55,960
Hello, Colonel.

92
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:57,929
Dr. Sparks,
my intel is showing me

93
00:04:57,996 --> 00:05:01,299
that the landsat readings
for the Wilforce-3
are off the charts.

94
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:03,635
Uh, yeah, we're
pretty close by her.

95
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,269
Would you like us
to do a physical recon?

96
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:06,771
Chadwick:
I would.

97
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,406
Also, if there's
any malfunction

98
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,375
or even
any new information,

99
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:11,443
I'd very much
like to have you report

100
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,110
back to me
as soon as possible.

101
00:05:13,178 --> 00:05:18,683
And, Dr. Sparks,
the California coastline
is a natural treasure.

102
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:22,487
I'll be damned
if Petro-Cal takes
a dump on my beaches.

103
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,021
Yes, Colonel.

104
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:26,991
Colonel Chadwick
wants us to stop
by Wilforce-3,

105
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:28,860
check it out.
He says the temperature

106
00:05:28,927 --> 00:05:30,862
is rising way too quickly
on that rig.

107
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:32,330
I hope we can get
our sniffers down there

108
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:33,965
before this storm moves in.

109
00:05:34,032 --> 00:05:35,032
Yeah, me, too.

110
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,601
Colonel Chadwick already
has his hands full

111
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,169
with
the storm preparation.

112
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,372
Yeah, he sure doesn't need
an offshore complication.

113
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,406
Nope.
I'll check it out.

114
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,874
All right.

115
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:44,175
Captain Worley,
on walkie-talkie:
Dr. Sparks?

116
00:05:45,644 --> 00:05:46,811
Yes, uh, Captain Worley,

117
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,414
we need to change course
for Wilforce-3.

118

to turn back now!

the looks of these skies!

I don't like it, either,
but we have our orders.

I've been navigating
these waters for 20 years,

We got 25 at zero
and 50 at 100,000 psi.

That's enough pressure
to cut through diamonds.

the blowout preventer.

It'll take some time
to disconnect
from a mile of pipeline.

we're dumping drilling
fluid in methane?

reroute the fluids

168

to that methane leak.

00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:57,501
Sea rover to Wilforce-3,
come in please!

185
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,603
[Static]

186
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,038
Wilforce-3, come in!

187
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:01,472
Radio operator:
Wilforce-3 to Sea Rover.

188
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,674
State your communication.

189
00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:04,141
This is Dr. Jenna Sparks.

190
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:06,711
I'm a research
meteorologist investigating

191
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,512
the atmospheric condition
around the rig.

192
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:11,616
I need to speak with
your manager immediately!

193
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:15,086
Radio operator:
let me connect you
to rig manager Winters.

194
00:09:15,153 --> 00:09:16,220
Operator?

195
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:17,622
[Static]

196
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,390
Wilforce-3,
come in please.

197
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,425
[Clegg groaning]

198
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:25,296
Wilforce-3,
please, come in!

199

[Static]

200
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,199
[Thud]
Unh!

201
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,638
What's happening down there?

202
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,372
We hit some kind
of molten deposit.

203
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,109
I'm worried about
the stability of this rig.

204
00:09:39,244 --> 00:09:40,244
Can you move?

205
00:09:40,312 --> 00:09:42,647
Yeah. Yeah,
all right, all right.

206
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,015
Listen, listen.

207
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:46,751
The generator turbines
are still on.

208
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:49,186
I know. That methane
is still leaking.

209
00:09:49,254 --> 00:09:52,223
It should
deactivate automatically.

210
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,659
No, the electricians
are troubleshooting.

211
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,428
They turned off
auto shutdown.

212
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,631
I know, but you got
to move a little faster.

213
00:09:59,698 --> 00:10:00,865
Can you?

214
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,500
'Cause if that methane
catches a spark,

215
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:04,335
we're like toast.

216
00:10:04,402 --> 00:10:05,737
Come on.
All right.

217
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:07,805
All right, let's go.
[Groans]

218
00:10:14,713 --> 00:10:15,880
There she is.

219
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,782
Warm water,
moist air.

220
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,316
It's the devil's
playground.

221
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:21,119
It's massive.

222
00:10:21,186 --> 00:10:24,321
We've, uh, got
less than half an hour
to reach that rig.

223
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:26,057
We got to go now!

224
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:35,133
[Engines whining]

225
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,769
Come on, come on,
come on.

226
00:10:37,836 --> 00:10:39,470
Lean on me.

227
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:40,805
The generators.

228
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:42,907
This way.
Just a little further.

229
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,976
The smell, the smell.

230
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,443
We're almost there.

231
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:48,680
Come on, come on!

232
00:10:48,747 --> 00:10:50,114
[Explosion]

233
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,324
Uncle...
Uncle Clegg!

234
00:11:00,392 --> 00:11:01,358
Uncle Clegg!

235
00:11:01,426 --> 00:11:02,894
Are you okay?

236
00:11:02,961 --> 00:11:06,064
Hey,
can you hear me?

237
00:11:06,131 --> 00:11:07,899
Come on.

238
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:10,401
Come on,
get up, get up.

239
00:11:10,468 --> 00:11:11,969
Get up.

240

241
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:23,815
Aah!

242
00:11:23,882 --> 00:11:25,683
What was that?

243
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:26,884
I don't know!

244
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:28,119
[Grunts]

245
00:11:29,988 --> 00:11:31,655
Rotor stall!

246
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:33,390
Going into a nosedive!

247
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,792
Pull up!

248
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,660
[Both straining]

249
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:39,230
Turbulence!
Come on!

250
00:11:45,804 --> 00:11:47,638
Come on!
We need to pull up!

251
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,673
Almost! [Grunts]

252
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,843
Almost got it!

253
00:11:54,512 --> 00:11:57,014
[Relieved sigh]

254
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:04,255
All right, nice flying.

255
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:10,728
We've lost
our generators.

256
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,130
We're on fire.

257
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:14,531
We got to evacuate now
before that storm comes in.

258
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:16,934
Yes, sir.
Mobilize the lifeboats,

259
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:19,103
prepare for evacuation.

260
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:27,145
This man
needs help now!

261
00:12:27,212 --> 00:12:29,046
All right, I'm a medic.
We'll get him to the chopper.

262
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:31,582
What happened
to your friend?

263
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,850
He's my uncle.

264
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,185
It was an accident
in the pump room.

265
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,921
Well, Dr. Cavanaugh
will take good care of him.

266
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:39,456
I'm Dr. Jenna Sparks
from the NOAA.

267
00:12:39,524 --> 00:12:41,959
I need to speak
to your rig manager now.

268
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:43,527
Follow me!

269
00:12:43,595 --> 00:12:45,263
[Thunder]

270
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,831
[Alarm blaring]
I'm Travis Verdon.

271
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,866
I'm here at request
of Colonel Chadwick.

272
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,768
It's been pretty bad
out here today.

273
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:51,836
What happened?

274
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,604
We hit a pocket
of molten lava.

275
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:56,808
The heat from that rupture
is creating an event.

276
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,042
What kind of event?

277
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,643
The water is superheating

278
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:02,379
making the surrounding air
highly unstable.

279
00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:05,683
What does this mean
to the rig?

280
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,153
Can you handle a storm
with the power
of five katrinas?

281
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,289
1,000 miles
per hour winds?

282
00:13:11,356 --> 00:13:12,690
I mean,
how can that be?

283
00:13:12,757 --> 00:13:14,558
We're not in the tropics.

284
00:13:14,626 --> 00:13:16,694
The warm water is
creating cyclone conditions.

285
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:19,396
It's changing everything
we know about the weather.

286
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:25,336
Travis.

287
00:13:25,403 --> 00:13:26,904
Rowell: What happened
in the pump room?

288
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,572
Joe and Bill were
killed in the blast.

289
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,807
My uncle
was badly wounded.

290
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,843
I got him
prepped for evac.

291
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,510
I'm sorry to hear that.

292
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:35,947
What exactly
happened in there?

293
00:13:36,014 --> 00:13:37,414
We hit a pocket
of magma,

294
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:39,483
a lava blast
that came up through
the bore hole.

295
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:42,353
Mr. Winters, Colonel Chadwick
sent me to investigate.

296
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,955
I'm an atmospheric specialist.

297
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:47,791
The warm water is creating
the first cyclone in California.

298
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,327
A cyclone?

299
00:13:49,394 --> 00:13:51,028
It's going to unleash
a chain of events

300
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:53,630
that's going to threaten
the entire West Coast.

301
00:13:53,698 --> 00:13:55,333
What kind of events?

302
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,434
It's going to be a storm
like you've never seen before.

303
00:13:57,502 --> 00:14:01,438
It's what we call
a super cyclone.

304
00:14:01,506 --> 00:14:04,375
Sir, I got over
100 company men
on this rig.

305
00:14:04,442 --> 00:14:06,443
This storm will impact this rig
in a matter of minutes.

306
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:07,611
Evacuate

307
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,513
all non-essential
personnel immediately.

308
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:11,315
I don't want anyone
left on this rig

309
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,516
other than
the hazard team.

310
00:14:12,584 --> 00:14:14,518
I'm on it.

311
00:14:14,586 --> 00:14:16,487
Travis, we got to get
your uncle out of here.

312
00:14:16,554 --> 00:14:18,022
He's in good hands.
I'm staying.

313
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,290
What do you need me
to do to help?

314
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,624
Travis, I know
that you're here to help,

315
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:23,560
but I am still
the safety officer on this rig.

316
00:14:23,628 --> 00:14:24,896
Now, this is my call.

317
00:14:24,963 --> 00:14:26,330
I am ordering you
to leave.

318
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,465
Listen,
I'm a structural
engineer, Gary.

319
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:29,733
Let me help you.

320
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:31,168
That's exactly why.

321
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:32,469
I can't think
of anyone better

322
00:14:32,537 --> 00:14:34,372
to coordinate
the crisis effort.

323
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:39,743
Now, Colonel Chadwick
is a soldier, not an oil man.

324
00:14:39,811 --> 00:14:41,345
Believe me,
you'd do much better

325
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:43,381
for me off this rig
than on it.

326
00:14:43,448 --> 00:14:44,982
Understood.
I got your back.

327
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,518
Well, if we're gonna
get off this rig,
we need to go now.

328
00:14:47,585 --> 00:14:48,519
Okay.

329
00:14:59,697 --> 00:15:01,065
How is he?

330
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,266
I had to put
a tourniquet

331
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,600
on his leg
to stop the bleeding.

332
00:15:03,668 --> 00:15:04,835
Can't feel my leg.

333
00:15:04,903 --> 00:15:06,337
I can do more for him
back at the Sea Rover.

334
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,072
Don't let me
lose my leg!

335
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,273
You're in good hands.

336
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:10,408
You're gonna be
all right, uncle.

337
00:15:10,475 --> 00:15:12,009
Hang in there.
Come on, let's go.

338
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,611
Oh, no.
[Thunder]

339
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:17,181
We're on the leading edge
of the storm.

340
00:15:18,883 --> 00:15:20,617
We're all set back here.

341
00:15:20,685 --> 00:15:21,819
Okay, hang on tight.

342
00:15:21,886 --> 00:15:23,520
[Engines whining]

343
00:15:33,665 --> 00:15:37,201
Sparks, if you are not here
in five minutes,

344
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,535
I am leavin'!

345
00:15:38,603 --> 00:15:40,338
I have lost crew,
and I swear to god,

346
00:15:40,405 --> 00:15:41,705
I am not gonna lose
any more.

347
00:15:41,773 --> 00:15:43,207
Do you hear me?

348
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,742
Worley,
don't go anywhere!

349
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,544
We're on our way!

350
00:15:47,612 --> 00:15:48,712
[Thunder]

351
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,152
[Gasping and straining]

352
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:03,794
Come on.

353
00:16:17,642 --> 00:16:18,976
I'll meet you
on the nav bridge.

354
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:20,344
All right.

355
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,146
Hey, Worley, we got
a wounded man here.

356
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:23,780
I'll need to stitch him up.

357
00:16:23,848 --> 00:16:25,016
Take him
to the galley.

358
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:27,485
Use the big steel
counter.

359
00:16:27,552 --> 00:16:29,320
Make it quick.
Come on, come on!

360
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,759
All right,
here we go.

361
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:37,428
Easy.

362

00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,988
They're gonna need
all our expertise

545
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,223
in order to deal
with this super cyclone.

546
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:10,894
Jenna's right.
We have to work together.

547
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:14,464
Look,
if we stop this storm,

548
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:16,800
then we can
save the coast

549
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:18,902
and your men
on Wilforce-3.

550
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:22,205
Okay.

551
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:23,640
All right, let's
go then, all right?

552
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:25,175
Come on.
Okay.

553
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:46,462
We've got to stay
ahead of the road closures.

554
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,665
Well, the last thing
I saw before the TV went out

555
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:51,668
is that they're only closing
down the beach cities.

556
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:53,203
Well, that's not enough.

557
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,238
I mean,
the current emergency plan

558
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:57,674
does not take into account
a storm of this size

559
00:27:57,742 --> 00:28:00,043
traveling
so far inland.

560
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:02,478
And that's feeding warm water
from a super volcano.

561
00:28:04,281 --> 00:28:06,616
Reporter: Doppler radar
indicates the storm is capable

562
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:08,018
of producing large hail,

563
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:10,253
breaking windows,
and damaging houses.

564
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:12,022
Severe storm warnings
remain in effect

565
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,791
for the following counties:
Los Angeles, Ventura,

566
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,393
Santa Barbara,
Orange, and San Diego.

567
00:28:29,173 --> 00:28:30,207
The oil!

568
00:28:30,274 --> 00:28:31,474
Let's go!

569
00:28:38,515 --> 00:28:41,517
Wilforce-3 to coast guard
command, do you copy?

570
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,855
Try another channel.

571
00:28:44,922 --> 00:28:46,156
Mayday! Mayday!

572
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:49,860
This is the Wilforce-3
deepwater drill rig!

573
00:28:49,927 --> 00:28:52,028
Do you copy?

574
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,364
Channel 13, 14, and 15
are all dead.

575
00:28:54,431 --> 00:28:55,498
Try channel 16.

576
00:28:55,566 --> 00:28:59,035
Mayday! We are in need
of immediate assistance!

577
00:28:59,103 --> 00:29:01,571
There's nothing, sir!
It's complete white noise!

578
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:03,106
Alex, get me something!

579
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:05,075
We're completely
isolated!

580
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,155
Aah!

581
00:29:26,597 --> 00:29:29,232
Well, I've been running
some calculations,

582
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,301
and I think we might
be able to do something

583
00:29:31,368 --> 00:29:33,770
with your silver iodide
nano-flakes.

584
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:34,805
Yeah?

585
00:29:34,872 --> 00:29:35,939
Well, my first priority

586
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:37,207
is to get the rescue
effort underway.

587
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,975
Yeah, well,
the Wilforce-3

588
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:40,710
is key
to this whole solution.

589
00:29:40,778 --> 00:29:42,145
You were there.

590
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:44,147
Yeah, I never seen
anything like it.

591
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:45,415
You know,
we've been talking

592
00:29:45,482 --> 00:29:47,184
for years
about climate change.

593
00:29:47,251 --> 00:29:48,819
We just didn't think
it would happen this fast.

594
00:29:48,886 --> 00:29:50,287
Well, it looks like
in less than an hour,

595
00:29:50,354 --> 00:29:51,688
southern California's
gonna be hit

596
00:29:51,755 --> 00:29:53,489
with this super cyclone.

597
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,063
This is an apocalyptic
weather event

598
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,332
that's happening right now.

599
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:08,939
Hey, look out!
Look out!

600
00:30:13,277 --> 00:30:15,145
Yeah, that way,
that way!

601
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:16,679
I can't see a thing!

602
00:30:16,747 --> 00:30:19,515
The wind,
it's kicking up mud.

603
00:30:19,583 --> 00:30:22,352
Uh, I don't
think that's mud.

604
00:30:22,419 --> 00:30:24,120
That's oil.

605
00:30:30,928 --> 00:30:33,663
The updrafts
must be lifting this fluid

606
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:35,665
from the Wilforce-3.

607
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:36,766
Here it comes!

608
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:39,035
[Tires screeching]

609
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:45,575
There, there, there!

610
00:30:45,642 --> 00:30:48,011
Turn down--Turn down
on that little road!

611
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:51,014
I can't!
It's too slippery!

612
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,522
Travis!
We're heading for it!

613
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,527
We're in it!

614
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:10,566
All right, hold on!
Aah!

615
00:31:10,634 --> 00:31:11,634
Oh, man!

616
00:31:11,702 --> 00:31:13,703
[Groans]

617
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:14,771
Hold onto something!

618
00:31:14,838 --> 00:31:16,472
Aah! Aah!

619
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,276
Oh, my god.

620
00:31:20,878 --> 00:31:23,113
[Wind blowing]

621
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,782
[Other sounds stop]

622
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:32,422

[Coughs]

625
00:32:11,528 --> 00:32:13,964
Aah! Oh!

626
00:32:14,031 --> 00:32:16,066
Ah! Oh!

627
00:32:17,534 --> 00:32:18,969
Hey, Dr. Cav,
you all right?

628
00:32:19,036 --> 00:32:20,337
Yeah, I banged up
my knees pretty good,

629
00:32:20,404 --> 00:32:21,737
but I think I'm all right.

630
00:32:21,805 --> 00:32:23,106
What happened?

631
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:25,575
Cavanaugh:
We were lifted
in a rotating wall.

632
00:32:25,642 --> 00:32:27,844
Travis: I never
heard of tornadoes
in California.

633
00:32:27,911 --> 00:32:29,579
It's the super cyclone.

634
00:32:29,646 --> 00:32:31,914
It's creating
a low pressure area.

635
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:33,583
It's perfect
for funnel clouds.

636
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,085
Where are we?

637
00:32:35,152 --> 00:32:36,219
[Beep]

638
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,988
Oh, man, my GPS is out.

639
00:32:38,055 --> 00:32:39,122
I got no bars.

640
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,991
You got any reception there?
Nope.

641
00:32:41,058 --> 00:32:42,592
You know,
we got to get going.

642
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:45,161
That super cyclone's
gonna hit the coast
any minute.

643
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:46,863
Yeah, come on.

644
00:32:51,068 --> 00:32:52,202
Reporter:
Reporting damaging winds

645
00:32:52,269 --> 00:32:53,703
in excess
of 200 miles per hour.

646
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,438
Stay away
from the coastline.

647
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:59,409
A severe storm warning
is in effect.

648
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,879
Locations impacted
include all beach cities.

649
00:33:06,683 --> 00:33:10,020
I don't understand.
It seems fine now.

650
00:33:10,087 --> 00:33:11,221
Are we in the eye?

651
00:33:11,288 --> 00:33:13,523
No, it's
the ring of convection.

652
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,392
It's what caused
the upward vertical movement

653
00:33:15,459 --> 00:33:16,893
of air
that lifted the suv.

654
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,361
We don't
have much time.

655
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:20,096
Yeah, the sooner we get
out of the open, the better.

656
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,532
Yeah, let's go.
Where are we?

657
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:23,733
No idea,
but it looks like....

658
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,767
Look.

659
00:33:24,835 --> 00:33:26,269
[Thunder]

660
00:33:28,705 --> 00:33:31,941
That's
Catumbo lightning
here in California?

661
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:33,309
Wait a minute.

662
00:33:33,377 --> 00:33:34,977
The super cyclone
is building up

663
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:37,147
a huge
electrical charge.

664
00:33:39,716 --> 00:33:41,617
Whoa, that's getting
pretty close.

665
00:33:41,685 --> 00:33:42,552
Yeah.

666
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:44,120
Hey, there's shelter.
Come on.

667
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,788
Yeah, come on,
let's go, let's go!

668
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:53,296
Reporter: In addition to
large hail and damaging winds,

669
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,597
continuous cloud-to-ground
lightning

00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:55,998
is occurring with this storm.

671
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:57,133
Move indoors immediately.

672
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,601
If you can hear
the thunder,

673
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,670
you are close enough
to be struck by lightning.

674
00:34:00,737 --> 00:34:02,572
Advancing storm
is impacting roads,

675
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:05,007
homes, and other
vital infrastructure.

676
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:09,546
Yeah, well, the storm
blew us further away
from Camp Pendleton.

677
00:34:09,613 --> 00:34:11,881
Yeah, better
keep moving then.

678
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:14,917
Yeah, we need to find
a low profile heavy vehicle.

679
00:34:14,985 --> 00:34:18,388
That's not exactly
low profile, but it's close.

680
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:19,655
Yeah.
It'll have to do.

681
00:34:19,723 --> 00:34:21,023
Yep.

682
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:22,592
Check this out.

683
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,195
Wonder if anyone's
in here.

684

Hello!

685
00:34:27,664 --> 00:34:29,899
Hello?
See what I can find.

686
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:31,167

Hello, there!

00:34:32,536 --> 00:34:33,403

Hey! Get away
from my truck!

We're not looters!

692
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:39,242
We're not looters.

693
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,310
We're with
the government.

694
00:34:40,377 --> 00:34:41,478
Same thing!

695
00:34:41,545 --> 00:34:43,179
Now get
off of my property!

696
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,747
We can't do that, sir.

697
00:34:44,815 --> 00:34:45,881
Oh, yes, you can.

698
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:47,683
Now get gone!

699
00:34:47,751 --> 00:34:48,784
Aah!

Hey, hey,
calm down, sir.

We're the solution here.

do you think you are?

705
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,196
Tell him.

00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,264
Uh, we're, uh...

707
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:03,500
We're with the NOAA,
sir.

708
00:35:03,567 --> 00:35:05,001
That's right.
Yeah.

709
00:35:05,068 --> 00:35:06,469
We need
to borrow your truck.

Hey, got the keys!
All right, start it.

713

Look, we're sorry.
We need to take
your truck, okay?

714
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:16,446
Just call that number
and file a claim.

Call the number, okay?

716
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:19,048
Come on,
we need to move!

717
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:20,116
And thanks
for the truck.

718
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:21,518
You're not welcome!

And leave me my gun!

720
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:26,556
Okay, have a good day.

from Camp Pendleton.

723
00:35:41,972 --> 00:35:43,206
What do they need?

724
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:44,340
To use the base
as a staging area

725
00:35:44,408 --> 00:35:45,642
for trucks
and generators.

726
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:46,643
Anything else?

727
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,144
They need men
for sandbagging.

728
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:49,712
Send bravo company
out to sandbag

729
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,781
and let transport know
that we're expecting company.

730
00:35:51,848 --> 00:35:52,782
Yes, sir.

731
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:53,783
Mayday! Mayday!

732
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,185
This is
the Wilforce-3 command.

733
00:35:55,252 --> 00:35:57,287
Come in!

734
00:35:57,354 --> 00:36:00,356
Come in! Wilforce-3!

735
00:36:02,259 --> 00:36:03,426
What's the status?

736
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,727
Hose teams are working.

737
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:06,028
I've got
every available man

738
00:36:06,096 --> 00:36:07,263
spraying sea water
on that fire.

739
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,831
Foam plug didn't work.

740
00:36:08,899 --> 00:36:11,000
Lava's still moving.

741
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:12,535
[Rig creaking]

742
00:36:14,938 --> 00:36:16,439
It's the struts.

743
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,973
We're listing.

744
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:19,542
Alex, check the ballast.

745
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,344
It's not safe yet.

746
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:22,912
With
a destabilized floor,

747
00:36:22,979 --> 00:36:25,448
the fire-retardant foam
and sea water

748
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,882
are tipping
the whole rig.

749
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,851
If we stop to rebalance
the pontoons,

750
00:36:28,919 --> 00:36:30,886
the fire's gonna
get out of control.

751
00:36:30,954 --> 00:36:32,488
What are we gonna do?

752
00:36:32,556 --> 00:36:34,190
We're gonna
do the same thing
we're doing already.

753
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:35,592
We're gonna walk
a very fine line

754
00:36:35,659 --> 00:36:38,361
between burning down
and destabilizing.

755
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:39,529
How's the radio?

756
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,997
I can't reach anybody.

757
00:36:42,065 --> 00:36:44,400
It's like we're
in some kind of a dead zone.

758
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:46,102
Well, it's
like Dr. Jenna said.

759
00:36:46,169 --> 00:36:48,605
The temperature
differentials must be
off the scale.

760
00:36:48,672 --> 00:36:51,374
So the punch-through
is causing the storm.

761
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:52,842
And we're in the middle.

762
00:36:52,909 --> 00:36:56,379

in the eye of the storm.

764
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:05,788
You saved
our ass back there!

765
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:07,457
Man, you're prepared
for anything!

766
00:37:07,524 --> 00:37:09,091
What, were you a scout?

767
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:10,826
Are you kidding?

768
00:37:10,894 --> 00:37:13,529
I'm about as far away
from a boy scout
as they are.

769
00:37:13,597 --> 00:37:15,798
How'd you
learn to handle
a gun like that?

770
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:19,201
I wasn't always
this dashing, heroic
engineer, you know.

771
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,470
[Laughs]

772
00:37:20,537 --> 00:37:21,871
The closer we get
to the coast,

773
00:37:21,938 --> 00:37:24,106
the worse
this is gonna get.

774
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,148
[Thunder]

775
00:37:38,855 --> 00:37:40,556
How much time
do you think we have

776
00:37:40,624 --> 00:37:43,393
before the full force
of this storm hits
the l.A. Basin?

777
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,596
Well, based on
the 72-hour value for wind

778
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:51,367
plus forward motion,
less than two hours.

779
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:55,438
Well, if we're
gonna have any hope
of stopping this storm,

780
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:56,839
we're gonna
have to make our move

781
00:37:56,907 --> 00:38:00,343
before it gets
too powerful to overcome.

782
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,312
How do we
do that, huh?

783
00:38:02,379 --> 00:38:04,079
Well, it's hard
to say for sure

784
00:38:04,147 --> 00:38:07,116
since nothing like this
has ever been attempted.

785
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:08,551
What are you
thinking, doc?

786
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,786
Well, I got the idea

787
00:38:09,853 --> 00:38:12,555
when I saw
that voltaic arc form.

788
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,424
From the lightning strike?

789
00:38:14,491 --> 00:38:17,893
Yes, and your
nano-materials research.

790
00:38:17,961 --> 00:38:19,796
Now, if we can
deliver a payload

791
00:38:19,863 --> 00:38:21,230
of silver iodide
nano-flakes

792
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:23,165
into the eye
of the storm...

793
00:38:23,233 --> 00:38:26,869
Ah, and use
the electrical energy
of the storm itself.

794
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:29,171
It'll generate a controlled
lightning strike

795
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:31,273
to disrupt
the spinning vortex.

796
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:33,042
Exactly, and weaken

797
00:38:33,109 --> 00:38:35,277
the eye wall
of the super cyclone.

798
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:36,479
Huh.

799
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:37,880
Do you
think it'll work?

800
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:39,816
Well, you know,
this science is based

801
00:38:39,883 --> 00:38:43,118
on a very old
a weather control technique,

802
00:38:43,186 --> 00:38:45,588
cloud seeding.

803
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,223
Yeah,
what about the rig?

804
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,691
How can we save it?

805
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:52,495

Colonel Chadwick comes in.

What is it,
Miss Peters?

813
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,628
I'm concerned about a report
from Commander Grady.

814
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,063
He said that there's trouble
with the Wilforce-3.

815
00:39:28,131 --> 00:39:29,532
What kind of trouble?

816
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,801
They're on top
of a volcano, sir.

817
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,504
They're mobilizing
a Hamilton class cutter,

818
00:39:34,571 --> 00:39:36,506
But there's no way
they'll get there tonight.

819
00:39:36,573 --> 00:39:38,207
We may have to clean up.

Those rigs can handle
the apocalypse.

821
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:42,512

on the civilian effort.

Hello! Hello!

905
00:44:30,233 --> 00:44:32,267
Dr. Sparks,
can you hear us?

906
00:44:32,335 --> 00:44:34,170
Dr. Sparks?

908
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:40,309
I had it for a second,
but now it's dead.

909
00:44:40,376 --> 00:44:42,044
Dr. Sparks?

910
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:46,348

912
00:44:48,518 --> 00:44:50,652
Hey! Up here!

913
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:52,154
Come on!

914
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,524
Come on, let's go!

915
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:57,159
Aah! Aah!

916
00:44:59,362 --> 00:45:01,530
Go! Watch out!

917
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:02,598
Go!

Aah!

919
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:12,374
What's your assessment
of all this, Dr. Flynn?

920
00:45:12,442 --> 00:45:13,609
Um....

921
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,446
It appears
to be a deposition

922
00:45:17,513 --> 00:45:19,615
of acidifying particles
and gases,

923
00:45:19,682 --> 00:45:22,517
coming together
to form...

924
00:45:22,585 --> 00:45:24,686
Flaming hail, sir.

925
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:27,356
Really?

926
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:29,759
And what exactly
is our emergency protocol

927
00:45:29,826 --> 00:45:31,827
for fire and brimstone,
doctor?

00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,495
Hide underground.

929
00:45:33,563 --> 00:45:35,297
Not during a flood.

930
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:40,636
Um, with
all due respect, sir,

931
00:45:40,703 --> 00:45:42,171
my specialty
is analyzing

932
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,374

and computer images.

933
00:45:45,441 --> 00:45:47,209
It's really
Dr. Sparks who....

934
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:49,378
Dr. Sparks is
unable to be contacted!

935
00:45:49,445 --> 00:45:52,714
Sir, I recommend we expand
our evacuation

936
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:55,717
and warning areas
to the entire mega region.

937
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:57,086
Excuse me.

938
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:59,588
Yeah, please.

939
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:04,393
I'm talking San Diego
to Los Angeles to Ventura.

00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:07,229
That's all
of Southern California.

941
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:09,665
Where are these people
supposed to evacuate to?

942
00:46:13,236 --> 00:46:16,005
We have to get them
East of San Bernardino.

943
00:46:16,072 --> 00:46:18,507
That's
16 million people, sir.

944
00:46:19,609 --> 00:46:21,177
That's impossible!

945
00:46:21,244 --> 00:46:22,611
We're looking
at a severe loss of life

946
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:25,614
with or
without evacuation.

947
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:29,351
Sir, doctors
Sparks and Cavanaugh
have spent years

948
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:31,921
studying
these extreme events.

949
00:46:31,988 --> 00:46:33,155
Their research
is the key

950
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:35,124
to understanding
what's going on,

951
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:38,360
and understanding
is the first step
to a solution.

952
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:41,831
So if we were
to just find them,
then we would be--

953
00:46:41,898 --> 00:46:43,665
Thank you, Dr. Flynn.

Sir, I have a special team
here for you.

on her location.

Traveling on foot.

959
00:46:55,712 --> 00:46:56,778
Bring her in.

Aah!

964
00:47:08,591 --> 00:47:10,392
Watch out!

We can use a land line.
Is yours working?

974
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:42,524
Honey, I haven't had
a land line since 2009.

975
00:47:42,592 --> 00:47:45,027
Come in.
I can't imagine what
you've been through.

976
00:47:45,095 --> 00:47:46,028

you getting something?

They've heard us.

It's a Hamilton class.
It's on its way.

989
00:48:14,557 --> 00:48:17,826
We need to keep
the fires under control
till they get here.

990

you need.

Anything we could use?

No, I'm sorry,
I don't have a radio,

I don't have a phone,

but my generator
is supplying power.

996
00:48:35,478 --> 00:48:36,812
You could charge
your phones
and your computers.

Yeah, that'll help a lot.
Yeah, that'd be great.

00:53:24,934 --> 00:53:27,102
What's the status
on the evacuation?

1085
00:53:27,169 --> 00:53:28,670
The situation
is not good, sir.

1086
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:31,573
Major arteries
and freeways are
completely blocked.

1087
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:33,275
What about
public transportation?

1088
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:35,377
Caltrans is reporting
that the high winds

1089
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:37,646
have knocked
three trains off the tracks.

1090
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,481
People able
to get out of the city?

1091
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:44,185
Sir, the 405, 110, and 10
are parking lots.

1092
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:46,154
People are getting
out of their cars and running.

1093
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:47,389
Running to where?

1094
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:49,291
There's nowhere
to run to, sir.

1095
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:50,592
What about
emergency services?

1096
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,227
Hospitals are overwhelmed.

1097
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:54,363
Fires are burning
out of control.

1098
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:55,864
We have
over 10 million people

1099
00:53:55,931 --> 00:53:58,400
without power
and more every second.

1100
00:53:58,468 --> 00:53:59,868
What's the governor
saying about all this?

1101
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:01,570
Sir, he's
mobilizing resources,

1102
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:04,205
but they just can't get here
to help us fast enough.

1103
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:05,540
Word on the street?

1104
00:54:05,608 --> 00:54:08,744
Sir, it's panic.

1105
00:54:08,811 --> 00:54:11,246
People are scared,
confused,

1106
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:13,181
and most of them armed.

1107
00:54:13,249 --> 00:54:14,883
It's not
a good combination.

1108
00:54:30,733 --> 00:54:34,869
Sir, the president
just declared
a state of emergency.

1109
00:54:34,937 --> 00:54:37,806
There are resources
being mobilized,

1110
00:54:37,873 --> 00:54:41,142
but we're not gonna
get any help until
the storm is over.

1111
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:44,379
Over? This is
just pre-storm turbulence.

1112
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:46,515
The storm
hasn't even hit yet!

1113
00:54:56,192 --> 00:54:57,726
How we doing on fuel?

1114
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:00,295
We have a little less
than a half a tank.

1115
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:01,963
I hope that's enough.

1116
00:55:02,031 --> 00:55:03,365
Better be.

1117
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:04,466
Yeah, well,
it's gonna take longer

1118
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:05,867
not taking the freeway.

1119
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:07,936
Yeah, every major artery
in the city is jammed.

1120
00:55:08,003 --> 00:55:10,772
Imagine what the I-5
looks like right now.

1121
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:11,807
Hell.

1122
00:55:11,874 --> 00:55:13,809
Oh, hey, hey!
Over here!

1123
00:55:13,876 --> 00:55:14,710
Turn on 74.

1124
00:55:14,777 --> 00:55:16,277
Hey, the national forest.

1125
00:55:16,346 --> 00:55:18,012
Yeah, it's gonna take us
out to the back end
of the base.

1126
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,314
Perfect.

1127
00:55:19,382 --> 00:55:20,682
Yeah, if we have
any luck,

1128
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,116
a marine patrol
might pick us up.

1129
00:55:22,184 --> 00:55:23,218
Mmm.

1130
00:55:23,285 --> 00:55:24,720
Careful!

1131
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:29,924
I got it, I got it,
I got it!

1132
00:55:33,295 --> 00:55:36,064
What's going on
with that tree?

1133
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:48,076
Well, looks like
it's starting to let up.

1134
00:55:48,143 --> 00:55:50,178
The road
got washed away.

1135
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:51,713
I'll have
to go around it.

1136
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:53,348
All right, well,
just take it careful.

1137
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:55,149
Slow, slow.

1138
00:55:55,217 --> 00:55:57,151
Here we go.

1139
00:55:57,219 --> 00:55:59,354
Travis.
Travis, the road!

1140
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:01,022
Back up, back up!

1141
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:02,223
Where?

1142
00:56:05,327 --> 00:56:06,395
I can't!
I'm stuck!

1143
00:56:06,462 --> 00:56:07,562
Okay, okay,
we got to get out!

1144
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:08,630
Stop the car!

1145
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:09,865
All right, all right.

1146
00:56:09,932 --> 00:56:11,700
All right.
Come on, let's go!

1147
00:56:24,246 --> 00:56:25,747
Be careful!

1148
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:28,884
This way!

1149
00:56:30,219 --> 00:56:31,920
Right over here,
guys!

1150
00:56:31,987 --> 00:56:34,022
I think we can
make it across the trees.

1151
00:56:34,089 --> 00:56:35,290
Come on.

1152
00:56:39,261 --> 00:56:40,295
Come on, hurry!

1153
00:56:40,362 --> 00:56:41,329
Grab my hand!

1154
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:43,264
Unh!

1155
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:47,602
Oh, my god.

1156
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:48,703
Doc, let's go!
Come on!

1157
00:56:48,771 --> 00:56:50,238
Come on! Percy!

1158
00:56:50,306 --> 00:56:51,440
You can make it!
Come on, doc!

1159
00:56:51,507 --> 00:56:52,441
Hurry up!
The ground's
giving way!

1160
00:56:52,508 --> 00:56:53,708
Come on!

1161
00:56:53,776 --> 00:56:54,876
Doc, come on!

1162
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:56,277
I can't reach!
I'm not gonna make it!

1163
00:56:56,345 --> 00:56:57,412
Come on, doc!

1164
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,480
You can do it!
You can make it!

1165
00:56:58,548 --> 00:56:59,748
I'm not gonna make it!

1166
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:01,115
Doc, come on!

1167
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:02,317
Come on, doc!

1168
00:57:02,384 --> 00:57:03,752
I can't reach!
Come on!

1169
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,487
Can't reach!
Doc!

1170
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:06,688
Aah!

1171
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,122
No!
No!

1172
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:10,058
Aah!

1173
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:12,727
Jenna!

1174
00:57:12,795 --> 00:57:14,062
He was just there!

1175
00:57:14,129 --> 00:57:15,129
Gone!

1176
00:57:15,197 --> 00:57:16,798
He just vanished!

1177
00:57:19,669 --> 00:57:23,071
Hamilton class,
this is Wilforce-3.

1178
00:57:23,138 --> 00:57:24,339
Go ahead.

1179
00:57:26,642 --> 00:57:28,443
Hamilton class,
do you copy?

1180
00:57:28,511 --> 00:57:29,911
Mayday! Mayday!

1181
00:57:29,979 --> 00:57:32,313
Radio operator:
Wilforce-3, come in.

1182
00:57:32,381 --> 00:57:34,950
Hamilton class
this is Wilforce-3

1183
00:57:35,017 --> 00:57:37,786
installation manager
Gary Winters.

1184
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:39,521
Winters,
this is Commander Jarvis

1185
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:41,523
of the U.S. Coast Guard
vessel Sherman.

1186
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:42,624
Do you require assistance?

1187
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:44,559
God, yes.
We are on fire.

1188
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:47,161
I need to evacuate
approximately 105 men.

1189
00:57:47,229 --> 00:57:48,730
How far out are you?

1190
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:49,898
Jarvis: The Sherman
will be on the scene

1191
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,432
in approximately
30 minutes.

1192
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:53,301
Begin staging
for evacuation.

1193
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:54,903
Yes, sir.

1194
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:58,807
Get all hands on deck
and prepare to evacuate
immediately.

1195
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:00,441
We'll start
with the wounded.

1196
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:01,910
Pull whatever guys
you need.

1197
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,879
Grab firefighters
if you have to.

1198
00:58:03,946 --> 00:58:06,280
We're getting
off this rig.

1199
00:58:10,786 --> 00:58:13,788
No, this is
a natural phenomenon.

1200
00:58:13,856 --> 00:58:17,425
It--It's
a massive sinkhole.

1201
00:58:17,493 --> 00:58:19,160
Sinkhole? How?

1202
00:58:20,796 --> 00:58:23,164
This bedrock,
it's limestone.

1203
00:58:23,232 --> 00:58:24,533
It's turned to mush.

1204
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,801
Yeah. The water
from the storm,
it's acidic.

1205
00:58:26,869 --> 00:58:28,202
Oil and drilling fluids.

1206
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:29,771
Yeah, and it was draining
into the ground

1207
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,173
and dissolving
the bedrock.

1208
00:58:32,241 --> 00:58:35,343
It's just like
exactly what happened
in Guatemala City.

1209
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:37,012
Where does it go?

1210
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:39,548
It's got to be
300 or 400 feet.

1211
00:58:39,615 --> 00:58:40,782
Listen, we got
to get out of here.

1212
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,017
We got to get
back to the base.

1213
00:58:42,084 --> 00:58:42,951
Come on.

1214
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:44,185
I can't believe
he's gone.

1215
00:58:44,253 --> 00:58:45,319
Come on!

1216
00:58:49,926 --> 00:58:51,826
Winters:
We're listing!

1217
00:58:51,894 --> 00:58:54,029
We're capsizing!

1218
00:58:58,434 --> 00:58:59,634
Come on.

1219
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:00,969
We're gonna you
guys out of here.

1220
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:03,071
Can I get
some help over here?

1221
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:05,640
Jarvis, on radio:
Winters, come in.

1222
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,943
There she is!
There's the Sherman!

1223
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:17,085
Help!

1224
00:59:17,152 --> 00:59:19,187
Get all the wounded
down to the lower deck!

1225
00:59:19,254 --> 00:59:21,189
I want all hands
in life jackets!

1226
00:59:21,256 --> 00:59:22,724
What about
the firefighters?

1227
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:23,959
We'll get everyone else
off first,

1228
00:59:24,026 --> 00:59:25,126
and they'll be the last
off the rig.

1229
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:26,327
I don't want
to take any chances!

1230
00:59:26,395 --> 00:59:27,395
Good.

1231
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:29,397
Why has the radio
gone dead?

1232
00:59:29,465 --> 00:59:31,265
Where is she?

1233
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:42,077
Are you seeing this?

1234
00:59:44,346 --> 00:59:45,981
Take cover!

1235
00:59:48,884 --> 00:59:50,451
Move, move!

1236
00:59:53,522 --> 00:59:54,856
Hey, Travis, look!

1237
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:55,857
Hey, help!
Hey!

1238
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:57,892
Hey, help!

1239
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:00,028
Hands up!

1240
01:00:02,197 --> 01:00:05,734
You're trespassing
on restricted property. Move.

1241
01:00:05,801 --> 01:00:06,968
No, no, no.
What are you
talking about?

1242
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:08,302
Back up.
Let me explain.

1243
01:00:08,370 --> 01:00:10,171
I'm Dr. Jenna Sparks.

1244
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:12,273
This is Travis Verdon.
What'd we do?

1245
01:00:12,341 --> 01:00:14,308
I'm placing both
of you under arrest.

1246
01:00:14,376 --> 01:00:15,476
For what?

1247
01:00:15,544 --> 01:00:17,311
You're trespassing
on a restricted area.

1248
01:00:17,379 --> 01:00:18,813
Pull the bed down.

1249
01:00:21,483 --> 01:00:22,751
Now hop up.

1250
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:30,892
Now you,
put those on her.

1251
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,326
Is this really necessary?

1252
01:00:32,394 --> 01:00:33,327
Do it now!

1253
01:00:35,731 --> 01:00:36,931
All right.

1254
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,803
[Clicking]

1255
01:00:41,871 --> 01:00:43,437
All right.

1256
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:48,242
Now you put those
on him behind his back.

1257
01:00:49,879 --> 01:00:52,147
Look, where are you
taking us?

1258
01:00:52,214 --> 01:00:53,347
Fort Irwin.

1259
01:00:53,415 --> 01:00:56,184
No, no! You have to take
us to Camp Pendleton.

1260
01:00:56,251 --> 01:00:57,952
Sorry, I'm taking you
to Fort Irwin.

1261
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:59,754
Sir, she's trying to tell you
what we've been through.

1262
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:01,056
Shut it!

1263
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:05,560
I have two intruders
in custody.

1264
01:01:05,627 --> 01:01:06,961
I'll bring them in now.

1265
01:01:07,029 --> 01:01:09,731
Travis, he's taking us
to the wrong base.

1266
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:11,733
My hands are too tight.
What?

1267
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:12,767
You're gonna
have to do it.

1268
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:14,035
Choke him out.
What?

1269
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:15,536
Yeah, the element
of surprise.

1270
01:01:15,604 --> 01:01:16,637
Just get up
behind him

1271
01:01:16,706 --> 01:01:17,872
and stay
in control, okay?

1272
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:18,973
You up for this?

1273
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:20,241
Base, do you copy?

1274
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:22,243
I'll just--I'll give you
the nod, all right?

1275
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:23,411
All right.

1276
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:28,983
All right,
now slide up in the bed.

1277
01:01:31,754 --> 01:01:32,721
I can't do it.
My hands are too tight.

1278
01:01:32,788 --> 01:01:34,522
You're gonna
have to help me.

1279
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:38,993
Do it now!

1280
01:01:39,061 --> 01:01:40,829
[Jenna grunting]

1281
01:01:40,896 --> 01:01:42,130
[Choking]
Come on!
Cut me loose!

1282
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:43,531
Okay!
Cut me loose!

1283
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:44,699
Okay, okay!

1284
01:01:44,767 --> 01:01:46,534
Cut me loose, I said!

1285
01:01:49,638 --> 01:01:51,706
[Coughing]

1286
01:01:51,774 --> 01:01:53,742
All right, loosen him,
loosen him.

1287
01:01:53,809 --> 01:01:55,476
Okay.

1288
01:01:55,544 --> 01:01:56,677
Stay right there.

1289
01:01:56,746 --> 01:01:58,613
[Coughing]

1290
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,481
All right.

1291
01:02:00,549 --> 01:02:03,118
Okay. Very slowly,

1292
01:02:03,185 --> 01:02:05,186
Get on your radio

1293
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:08,923
and have them patch you
to Colonel Chadwick.

1294
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:11,325
Do it now!

1295
01:02:11,393 --> 01:02:12,827
I need an emergency
patch-through

1296
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,428
To Colonel Chadwick
at Pendleton.

1297
01:02:14,496 --> 01:02:16,064
[Coughs]

1298
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:21,870
Is that an affirmative?

1299
01:02:21,937 --> 01:02:24,739
Then, yes, bring
Dr. Jenna Sparks
here immediately.

1300
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:26,540
They're on the way.

1301
01:02:31,213 --> 01:02:34,548
[Alarm blaring]

1302
01:02:34,616 --> 01:02:35,884
[Coughing]

1303
01:02:39,488 --> 01:02:42,023
Structural support
is losing integrity.

1304
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:44,725
Areas of the rig are
already collapsing.

1305
01:02:44,794 --> 01:02:45,994
How much time
do we have?

1306
01:02:46,061 --> 01:02:48,396
An hour, maybe two.

1307
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:53,768
What are our options?

1308
01:02:53,836 --> 01:02:55,403
The Sherman was--

1309
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:57,138
I don't even know
what I saw out there.

1310
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:59,874
Our only hope
is rescue.

1311
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:03,278
Alex, nobody's
coming for us.

1312
01:03:03,345 --> 01:03:06,915
We got to fight
if we want to save
our own lives.

1313
01:03:06,982 --> 01:03:08,482
Yes, sir.

1314
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:11,585
Think. Now, is there
anything that you can do

1315
01:03:11,653 --> 01:03:13,521
to keep us
out of that lava?

1316
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:19,828
The super cyclone
is turning

1317
01:03:19,895 --> 01:03:22,530
16 million
Southern Californians
into refugees.

1318
01:03:22,597 --> 01:03:23,932
There may be an option.

1319
01:03:23,999 --> 01:03:26,201
If you have any ideas,
doctor, now is the time.

1320
01:03:26,268 --> 01:03:27,635
It was
Dr. Cavanaugh's theory,

1321
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:29,137
but I think
I can explain it.

1322
01:03:29,205 --> 01:03:30,404
This super cyclone
is unique

1323
01:03:30,472 --> 01:03:32,040
because its formation
was created by man.

1324
01:03:32,107 --> 01:03:33,507
How so?

1325
01:03:33,575 --> 01:03:35,910
Travis. He can best explain
what happened on that rig.

1326
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:37,145
Yeah.

1327
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:38,980
The Wilforce-3 was
designed to drill deeper

1328
01:03:39,048 --> 01:03:40,114
into the earth's crust

1329
01:03:40,182 --> 01:03:41,649
than any other rig
had gone before.

1330
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:43,451
I mean, we knew
there would be
problems at first,

1331
01:03:43,518 --> 01:03:46,387
but we never saw
anything quite like this.

1332
01:03:51,526 --> 01:03:54,095
So what exactly
did happen out there?

1333
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:57,031
Well, the drill pierced
the earth's crust,

1334
01:03:57,099 --> 01:04:01,736
broke into the mantle
and penetrated a magma pocket,

1335
01:04:01,803 --> 01:04:03,338
and the lava flowed
into the rig.

1336
01:04:03,405 --> 01:04:05,907
You synthesized
a super volcano.

1337
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:09,710
This new super volcano,
it's bigger
than Mauna Loa.

1338
01:04:09,778 --> 01:04:12,013
So how does this volcano
tie into the storm?

1339
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:15,783
The massive quantities
of lava elevated
the water temperature,

1340
01:04:15,851 --> 01:04:20,388
which created a low pressure
vortex around the Wilforce-3.

1341
01:04:20,455 --> 01:04:24,492
And now the atmosphere
around the rig
is highly unstable.

1342
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:25,994
And your solution?

1343
01:04:26,061 --> 01:04:30,064
Well, if you
can deliver a payload

1344
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:33,501
of silver iodide
nano-flakes into the storm,

1345
01:04:33,568 --> 01:04:37,071
we can generate
a controlled lightning strike
to break up the vortex.

1346
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:39,573
How do you propose
we deliver this payload?

1347
01:04:39,641 --> 01:04:43,144
Do you have any pilot
who can navigate
under these conditions?

1348
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:45,914
Dr. Sparks,
you're talking
about a suicide mission.

1349
01:04:45,981 --> 01:04:48,383
No, you don't
know that for sure.

1350
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:50,418
The hurricane hunters
were able to....

1351
01:04:50,485 --> 01:04:52,853
Those planes fly
at 45,000 feet.

1352
01:04:52,922 --> 01:04:54,389
You're talking about
flying an F-16

1353
01:04:54,456 --> 01:04:56,724
directly into
the eye wall of a storm.

1354
01:04:56,792 --> 01:04:58,659
Colonel Chadwick, sir?

1355
01:04:58,727 --> 01:05:00,261
Sergeant Major?

1356
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:03,597
Sir, I might have a man,
a pilot, who can do the job.

1357
01:05:03,665 --> 01:05:04,465
Who?

1358
01:05:04,533 --> 01:05:06,534
Lieutenant
Dave Connelly.

1359
01:05:06,601 --> 01:05:07,768
Connelly?

1360
01:05:07,836 --> 01:05:09,837
He's fresh
from combat, sir,

1361
01:05:09,905 --> 01:05:11,439
but I know
he can do the job.

1362
01:05:11,506 --> 01:05:13,107
He's an expert
in maneuvering.

1363
01:05:13,175 --> 01:05:14,909
He's just a kid.

1364
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:16,744
He's
our only hope, sir.

1365
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:30,358
Find him. Make sure
he knows the risks.

1366
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:32,760
This
is volunteer only.

1367
01:05:32,828 --> 01:05:34,195
Yes, sir.

1368
01:05:48,743 --> 01:05:51,779
So, you need
someone crazy, huh?

1369
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:52,813
Apparently.

1370
01:05:54,049 --> 01:05:56,250
The payload is secure.

1371
01:05:56,318 --> 01:05:58,119
When do I deploy?

1372
01:05:58,187 --> 01:06:00,054
The nano-flakes
must be released

1373
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:01,856
as you enter
the eye wall of the storm.

1374
01:06:01,923 --> 01:06:04,258
That's where the electrical
charge is the strongest.

1375
01:06:04,326 --> 01:06:05,726
How will I know?

1376
01:06:05,794 --> 01:06:07,261
We'll track you
on radar.

1377
01:06:07,329 --> 01:06:10,131
We've established
a high-frequency
communication link.

1378
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:11,632
I'll give you the signal
at the right time.

1379
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:13,534
I'm ready to do
what needs to be done.

1380
01:06:13,602 --> 01:06:16,371
Son, if you're successful,
you'll save millions of lives.

1381
01:06:16,438 --> 01:06:17,505
My whole
family lives

1382
01:06:17,572 --> 01:06:19,007
in Southern
California, sir.

1383
01:06:19,074 --> 01:06:21,009
Good luck, Lieutenant.

1384
01:06:21,076 --> 01:06:23,177
Thank you, sir.

1385
01:06:50,472 --> 01:06:54,942
Okay, he's entering
the primary frontal boundary.

1386
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:57,545
Approaching
target area.

1387
01:06:57,612 --> 01:06:58,913
You're doing great,
Lieutenant.

1388
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:00,748
You'll be entering
the rain shield soon.

1389
01:07:00,815 --> 01:07:02,816
It's going
to get choppy.

1390
01:07:02,884 --> 01:07:04,152
Roger.

1391
01:07:04,219 --> 01:07:06,854
Once he can clear
the spiral bands,

1392
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:09,290
he'll have
a straight shot
at the eye wall.

1393
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:11,692
Hey, what's going on
with his radar tag?

Is there anything--
Anything we can do?

1399
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:33,881
We gather the men,
we go to the highest ground.

1400
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:36,817
Abandon our posts.

1401
01:07:36,885 --> 01:07:38,419
Go out fighting.

1402
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:40,888
Fighting
is all we can do...

1403
01:07:40,956 --> 01:07:42,756

1404
01:07:42,824 --> 01:07:44,492

01:07:58,140 --> 01:07:59,840
It's an F-16!

1408
01:07:59,908 --> 01:08:02,210
Maybe it's another
rescue attempt.

There! There he is!

1412
01:08:15,557 --> 01:08:17,825
Connelly, do you read?

1413
01:08:20,395 --> 01:08:21,762
Are you there?

1414
01:08:21,830 --> 01:08:25,065
Connelly:
Yes, ma'am. I'm flying
fast towards it.

1415
01:08:25,134 --> 01:08:26,700
Great, great.

1416
01:08:26,768 --> 01:08:28,636
Connelly,
you'll be approaching
the target area

1417
01:08:28,703 --> 01:08:32,340
in less
than two minutes.

1418
01:08:32,407 --> 01:08:34,175
Lieutenant,
this is Travis Verdon.

1419
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:36,277
I'm an engineer
from the Wilforce-3 rig.

1420
01:08:36,345 --> 01:08:37,978
Can you see her?

1421
01:08:39,681 --> 01:08:41,782
There's something
there, sir.

1422
01:08:50,725 --> 01:08:52,926
Don't let go!

1423
01:08:52,994 --> 01:08:53,927
Take my hand!

1424
01:08:53,995 --> 01:08:55,163
Hold me!
I got you!

1425
01:08:55,230 --> 01:08:57,231
Hold me!
Don't let go!

1426
01:08:57,299 --> 01:08:58,932
Don't let it go!

1427
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,134
Aah!
No!

1428
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:01,735
Aah!

1429
01:09:08,243 --> 01:09:10,444
Aah!

1430
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,754
Connelly,
what do you see?

1431
01:09:20,822 --> 01:09:23,924
A lake of fire,
lava flares.

1432
01:09:45,847 --> 01:09:49,517
I never thought
it'd end like this.

1433
01:09:49,585 --> 01:09:50,718
It's been an honor.

1434
01:09:50,785 --> 01:09:51,885
You, too, sir.

1435
01:09:51,953 --> 01:09:53,887
[Screaming]

1436
01:09:53,955 --> 01:09:56,190
I guess there's some fights
you just don't win.

1437
01:09:56,258 --> 01:09:57,725
We tried.

1438
01:09:57,792 --> 01:09:58,959
Yes, sir.

1439
01:10:01,196 --> 01:10:02,863
So how do we do this?

1440
01:10:04,299 --> 01:10:07,101
Jump.

1441
01:10:07,168 --> 01:10:10,037
I don't think
I can do this, Gary!

1442
01:10:10,105 --> 01:10:12,773
Yeah, you can.

1443
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:14,842
Just let go.

1444
01:10:16,878 --> 01:10:18,679
[Screaming]

1445
01:10:22,351 --> 01:10:25,953
[Screaming]

1446
01:10:27,188 --> 01:10:28,956
[Screaming]

1447
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:39,400
[Screaming]

1448
01:11:00,289 --> 01:11:01,955
Few more seconds.

1449
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:07,161
Okay, Connelly,
t-minus 10,

1450
01:11:07,228 --> 01:11:08,228
9,

1451
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:10,464
8...

1452
01:11:13,402 --> 01:11:15,269
Jenna: 7,

1453
01:11:15,337 --> 01:11:16,304
6,

1454
01:11:16,371 --> 01:11:18,906
5,

1455
01:11:18,973 --> 01:11:20,308
4,

1456
01:11:20,375 --> 01:11:23,076
3...

1457
01:11:23,144 --> 01:11:24,211
No!

1458
01:11:24,279 --> 01:11:25,279
Where's
his radar tag?

1459
01:11:25,347 --> 01:11:27,014
Where's Connelly?

1460
01:11:27,081 --> 01:11:28,982
The flare. He's gone.

1461
01:11:29,050 --> 01:11:30,418
Chadwick:
Connelly, come in.

1462
01:11:30,485 --> 01:11:33,987
Connelly--Connelly,
do you read?

1463
01:11:34,055 --> 01:11:35,155
No!

1464
01:11:35,223 --> 01:11:36,256
Oh, my god.

1465
01:11:36,325 --> 01:11:38,526
He was our last hope.

1466
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:42,797
He was a hero.

1467
01:11:42,864 --> 01:11:45,499
Travis: The Wilforce-3,
she's gone.

1468
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:52,873
Sir, the storm,
it's moving inland.

1469
01:11:59,514 --> 01:12:00,914
Sir, you got to listen!

1470
01:12:00,982 --> 01:12:02,282
There's got to be
a manmade force

1471
01:12:02,351 --> 01:12:03,884
powerful enough
to stop this.

1472
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:05,786
Unless there's some way
to convince our boys from Thule

1473
01:12:05,854 --> 01:12:07,054
to drag an iceberg
down here from Greenland,

1474
01:12:07,121 --> 01:12:08,556
I'm gonna have to tell
the General

1475
01:12:08,623 --> 01:12:09,990
that the situation's fubar.

1476
01:12:10,058 --> 01:12:11,425
Wait, wait, wait,
I've got an idea!

1477
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:14,495
Dr. Sparks, I appreciate
your enthusiasm,

1478
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:16,230
But I just had one
of my top pilots

1479
01:12:16,297 --> 01:12:19,333
Fly an F-16
into a super volcano
for nothing!

1480
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:21,134
Colonel.
Colonel, wait, please!

1481
01:12:21,202 --> 01:12:22,670
You've got to listen!

1482
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:24,037
Bring
in the generators.

1483
01:12:24,105 --> 01:12:26,707
No, sir, Huntington Beach
is out of commission.

1484
01:12:26,775 --> 01:12:28,609
Jenna:
Colonel! Colonel?

1485
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:29,977
You have to listen.

1486
01:12:30,044 --> 01:12:31,512
What, Dr. Sparks?

1487
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:33,080
We need to go
on one more mission.

1488
01:12:33,147 --> 01:12:34,482
Absolutely not.
I'm not gonna let

1489
01:12:34,549 --> 01:12:36,049
another man fly
to his death.

1490
01:12:36,117 --> 01:12:37,951
You won't have to.
I'll go, sir.

1491
01:12:38,019 --> 01:12:39,052
Me, too.

1492
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,721
What kind
of a mission

1493
01:12:40,789 --> 01:12:42,256
are you guys
talking about?

1494
01:12:42,323 --> 01:12:45,259
We need to deprive the storm
of its energy source.

1495
01:12:45,326 --> 01:12:47,160
This storm is
completely uncontrollable.

1496
01:12:47,228 --> 01:12:48,262
You've seen that.

1497
01:12:48,329 --> 01:12:50,030
We use liquid nitrogen.

1498
01:12:50,098 --> 01:12:51,198
It'll form a plug,

1499
01:12:51,266 --> 01:12:53,967
stop the flow of lava,
and cool the water.

1500
01:12:54,035 --> 01:12:56,804
How are we gonna get
liquid nitrogen
to the site?

1501
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:58,773
We'll take it
in a liquefied
natural gas tanker.

1502
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:00,974
It's like a giant thermos
with a pumping system.

1503
01:13:01,042 --> 01:13:02,443
Where
are we gonna find

1504
01:13:02,511 --> 01:13:04,612
one of these giant
thermos tankers?

1505
01:13:04,679 --> 01:13:06,614
Petro-Cal in long beach
has one right now.

1506
01:13:06,681 --> 01:13:07,848
Who's gonna drive it?

1507
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:09,884
I will, sir.

1508
01:13:09,951 --> 01:13:12,352
So how you gonna
keep it from melting?

1509
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:15,656
The ocean currents
are moving the lava
to the East,

1510
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:17,525
so there's
a small corridor of water

1511
01:13:17,592 --> 01:13:18,526
that would allow
the tanker passage,

1512
01:13:18,593 --> 01:13:21,261
but it won't last long.

1513
01:13:21,329 --> 01:13:23,230
Yeah, but if I can get
in there with the tanker,

1514
01:13:23,298 --> 01:13:25,132
I could
deliver the payload.

1515
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:26,199
How you gonna get out?

1516
01:13:26,267 --> 01:13:27,334
A chopper evac.

1517
01:13:27,402 --> 01:13:29,837
I see.

1518
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:32,339
Using the size
of the original

1519
01:13:32,407 --> 01:13:33,841
bore hole conduit

1520
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:36,944
and factoring in the expanse
of the lava throat...

1521
01:13:39,380 --> 01:13:43,984
135,000 cubic meters would
generate a substantial plug.

1522
01:13:44,052 --> 01:13:45,986
Yeah, tanker Euclides
would do it.

1523
01:13:46,054 --> 01:13:47,287
And I'll be
on the tanker

1524
01:13:47,355 --> 01:13:49,156
monitoring
the atmospheric conditions.

1525
01:13:49,223 --> 01:13:51,625
I'll know exactly
when the storm is destroyed.

1526
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:53,928
Is this
a permanent solution?

1527
01:13:53,995 --> 01:13:55,195
Yes, sir.

1528
01:13:55,263 --> 01:13:56,597
Yes, permanent.

1529
01:13:56,665 --> 01:14:01,034
Where we gonna find
135,000 cubic meters
of liquid nitrogen?

1530
01:14:01,102 --> 01:14:02,202
Vandenberg.

1531
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:04,505
They've got huge tanks
of liquid nitrogen out there

1532
01:14:04,573 --> 01:14:06,373
for the rocket
launches, sir.

1533
01:14:06,441 --> 01:14:08,208
And once the cool water

1534
01:14:08,276 --> 01:14:10,578
sucks the energy
out of the super cyclone,

1535
01:14:10,645 --> 01:14:12,379
it will be more
like a thunderstorm

1536
01:14:12,447 --> 01:14:14,348
rather than hurricane.

1537
01:14:14,415 --> 01:14:16,283
What do you think, sir?

1538
01:14:20,421 --> 01:14:22,623
I think
if you're wrong...

1539
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:25,559
Most of the West Coast
is gonna die,

1540
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:27,728
including us.

1541
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:47,280
Colonel.

1542
01:14:47,348 --> 01:14:49,049
Once we arrive on site,
the crew will have

1543
01:14:49,117 --> 01:14:51,051
less than 15 minutes
to deploy the l.N.

1544
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:53,020
before our window closes
and the lava

1545
01:14:53,087 --> 01:14:55,288
completely destroys
the tanker's outer hull.

1546
01:14:55,356 --> 01:14:58,058
I'll be controlling
a laser-guided
targeting system

1547
01:14:58,126 --> 01:14:59,593
to navigate
the payload drop

1548
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:01,294
so we can make
every second count.

1549
01:15:01,362 --> 01:15:03,564
The chopper will
be sure to evacuate
you and your team

1550
01:15:03,632 --> 01:15:05,065
off the tanker
before she goes down.

1551
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:06,500
Yeah, it's gonna be
a rough ride

1552
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:08,135
no matter how we time it.

1553
01:15:08,202 --> 01:15:10,203
Yeah, well,
we're cutting it very close,

1554
01:15:10,271 --> 01:15:11,071
so we better get going.

1555
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:12,673
Yep, this is it.
Good luck.

1556
01:15:12,741 --> 01:15:14,041
Thank you.

1557
01:15:14,108 --> 01:15:15,409
Hey, Travis,
you control the nav,

1558
01:15:15,476 --> 01:15:16,510
and I'll take
care of operations.

1559
01:15:16,578 --> 01:15:17,711
Okay.

1560
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,214
Chadwick:
What's the status?

1561
01:15:21,282 --> 01:15:23,383
The Euclides
is on its way, sir.

1562
01:15:23,451 --> 01:15:25,619
[Radio chatter]

1563
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:27,354
They're gonna thread
the needle

1564
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:28,856
through that cooler water.

1565
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:31,191
Even with a ship
that size, sir...

1566
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:35,195
This storm is a monster.

1567
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:48,208
Yeah, Colonel,
we're approaching target area.

1568
01:15:51,312 --> 01:15:56,584
Crew, prepare
to deploy liquid nitrogen.

1569
01:15:56,651 --> 01:15:58,085
Travis, on loudspeaker:
Open the valve on the pump

1570
01:15:58,152 --> 01:16:00,287
and load the l.N.
into the sprayer.

1571
01:16:00,354 --> 01:16:03,256
Be careful, boys,
there's a lot
of pressure down there.

1572
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:08,195
[Rattling]

1573
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:19,974
Travis, something's wrong.

1574
01:16:20,041 --> 01:16:22,309
The hull is dissolving
too quickly.

1575
01:16:26,514 --> 01:16:29,249
The current
is pulling us off course.

1576
01:16:29,317 --> 01:16:31,118
We're losing our window.

1577
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:34,221
We're caught
in a whirlpool!

1578
01:16:34,288 --> 01:16:36,423
The current
is pulling us under!

1579
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:43,530
Colonel,
we're in trouble!

1580
01:16:43,598 --> 01:16:44,999
Send the chopper now!

1581
01:16:45,967 --> 01:16:48,468
Deploy
rescue chopper now!

1582
01:16:48,536 --> 01:16:51,471
Colonel? Colonel!

1583
01:16:58,312 --> 01:17:00,213
Rescue chopper
is en route, Jenna!

1584
01:17:00,281 --> 01:17:01,381
It's en route!

1585
01:17:01,449 --> 01:17:04,752
Position the sprayer
and release the valve.

1586
01:17:04,819 --> 01:17:06,954
Crewman:
Valve released.

1587
01:17:07,822 --> 01:17:10,858
It's too hot!
It's too hot!

1588
01:17:13,762 --> 01:17:16,830
Deploy the l.N. Now!

1589
01:17:26,775 --> 01:17:28,676
The temperatures
are dropping.

01:17:28,743 --> 01:17:30,177
[Metal creaking]

1591
01:17:33,314 --> 01:17:34,381
Uhh!

1592
01:17:34,448 --> 01:17:36,050
[Gasps]

1593
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:41,421
The hull's breached,
but it's too soon.

1594
01:17:41,489 --> 01:17:42,489
Something's wrong.

1595
01:17:49,964 --> 01:17:51,865
She's on auto-pilot.

1596
01:17:51,933 --> 01:17:53,867
She's circling
with the whirlpool.

1597

1598
01:17:55,369 --> 01:17:56,536

Travis: Delivering the l.N.
until she goes down.

1601
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:05,378
Something's
definitely not right.

1602
01:18:05,446 --> 01:18:07,181
Time to evacuate!

1603
01:18:10,085 --> 01:18:11,484

to abandon ship!

Prepare
to abandon ship!

The temperatures
are rising again!

1608
01:18:20,695 --> 01:18:21,795
Okay,
we got to go now!

1609
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:23,296
Travis: Yeah,
go topside and make sure

1610
01:18:23,364 --> 01:18:25,065
all the men
are accounted for.

1611
01:18:26,801 --> 01:18:29,603
All right. Travis,
don't be long, okay?

1612
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:31,571
We don't have
much time left.

1613
01:18:47,555 --> 01:18:49,823
Travis, where are you?

1614
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:51,324
[Creaking]

1615
01:18:51,392 --> 01:18:54,128
Travis, get up here!

1616
01:18:54,195 --> 01:18:55,863
No! We got
to wait for him!

1617
01:18:55,930 --> 01:18:57,330
There's one more man!

1618
01:18:57,398 --> 01:18:58,465
Travis!

1619
01:19:02,003 --> 01:19:04,437
Travis, can you hear me?

1620
01:19:09,778 --> 01:19:11,344
No, there's
one more man!

1621
01:19:11,412 --> 01:19:13,113
Get us out of here!

1622
01:19:13,181 --> 01:19:14,915
We can't leave him!

1623
01:19:21,355 --> 01:19:23,390
Reporter:
36 hours of steady rainfall

1624
01:19:23,457 --> 01:19:25,025
has left many homes
in the metro area

1625
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:26,827
knee-deep in floodwaters.

1626
01:19:26,895 --> 01:19:29,396
Temperatures
are normalizing.

1627
01:19:30,698 --> 01:19:33,333
The storm's breaking up.

1628
01:19:33,401 --> 01:19:36,236
[Thunder]

1629
01:19:36,304 --> 01:19:38,138
Mobilize
search and rescue

1630
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:39,539
and get the governor
on the phone.

1631
01:19:39,607 --> 01:19:40,908
Is this over?

1632
01:19:40,975 --> 01:19:43,076
Is this really over?

1633
01:19:47,148 --> 01:19:49,649
Congratulations,
Colonel.

1634
01:19:49,717 --> 01:19:51,518
Let's hope it sticks.

1635
01:19:58,193 --> 01:20:00,627
The super cyclone's
breaking up!

1636
01:20:04,732 --> 01:20:06,066
I'm so sorry.

1637
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:10,103
You did it, Travis.

1638
01:20:30,658 --> 01:20:32,025
[Sighs]

1639
01:20:43,637 --> 01:20:47,374
Must have gotten
pretty hairy
on that tanker.

1640
01:20:47,441 --> 01:20:49,376
Dr. Flynn, uh,

1641
01:20:49,443 --> 01:20:52,579
if you don't mind,
I'd rather be alone.

1642
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:56,116
Okay, yeah, um...

1643
01:20:56,184 --> 01:20:59,152
I totally understand.

1644
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:03,991
I'll just be below decks
if you need me.

1645
01:21:04,058 --> 01:21:05,759
Thank you.

1646
01:21:32,153 --> 01:21:36,089
Captain Worley,
10:00, do you see it?

1647
01:21:37,758 --> 01:21:38,758
Yes, I do.

1648
01:21:47,601 --> 01:21:48,701
What's going on?

1649
01:21:48,769 --> 01:21:49,937
There's something out there.

1650
01:21:50,004 --> 01:21:51,038
What is it?

1651
01:21:51,105 --> 01:21:52,272
I don't know,

1652
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:54,174
but we're gonna go closer
to take a look.

1653
01:22:02,716 --> 01:22:04,451
It's a person!

1654
01:22:04,518 --> 01:22:06,753
Captain Worley,
do you see it?

1655
01:22:06,821 --> 01:22:09,122
It's a person!

1656
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:12,159
I see it! I see it!

1657
01:22:13,227 --> 01:22:15,728
Worley: Throw the net.

1658
01:22:15,796 --> 01:22:20,500
Let's reel him in.

1659
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:28,675
[Winch grinding]

1660
01:22:38,152 --> 01:22:39,552
Jenna: Is it him?

1661
01:22:40,855 --> 01:22:42,255
It is him!

1662
01:22:42,323 --> 01:22:43,656
Travis, it is you!

1663
01:22:43,724 --> 01:22:45,092
He's alive.

1664
01:22:45,159 --> 01:22:47,827
Go get some water
and a blanket.

1665
01:22:47,895 --> 01:22:49,729
You're gonna be fine.

1666
01:22:49,797 --> 01:22:50,830
You're gonna
be okay.

1667
01:22:50,898 --> 01:22:52,165
Travis,
can you hear me?

1668
01:22:52,233 --> 01:22:53,566
Okay,
can you get up?

1669
01:22:53,634 --> 01:22:56,769
Yeah. Give me a hand.
All right.

1670
01:23:01,575 --> 01:23:04,144
Captain Worley?
Yeah, we got him.

1671
01:23:04,212 --> 01:23:06,346
Take us back.

1672
01:23:06,414 --> 01:23:08,915
Aye, aye, Dr. Sparks,

1673
01:23:08,983 --> 01:23:10,517
With pleasure.

1674
01:23:15,589 --> 01:23:16,990
Here.

1675
01:23:17,058 --> 01:23:18,625
Travis?

1676
01:23:18,692 --> 01:23:21,528
Travis, come on.

1677
01:23:24,932 --> 01:23:27,501
All right, easy, easy.

1678
01:23:29,670 --> 01:23:32,772
Watch your foot,
watch your foot.

1679
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:34,474
Okay.

1680
01:23:57,898 --> 01:23:59,299
Hey, uh...

1681
01:24:01,102 --> 01:24:03,570
Thanks for
not giving up on me.

1682
01:24:03,637 --> 01:24:05,605
You're welcome.

1683
01:24:09,977 --> 01:24:13,547
Hey, look, a rainbow.

1684
01:24:16,451 --> 01:24:19,419
Actually, it's, um,

1685
01:24:19,487 --> 01:24:21,555
a circumhorizontal arc.

1686
01:24:21,622 --> 01:24:23,690
It's the off-gassing
of liquid nitrogen,

1687
01:24:23,757 --> 01:24:27,994
and it creates
these, um, plate-shaped
crystals in the clouds.

1688
01:24:28,062 --> 01:24:29,796
It's amazing, huh?

1689
01:24:29,863 --> 01:24:30,830
Yeah.

1690
01:24:35,002 --> 01:24:37,370
It's beautiful.
