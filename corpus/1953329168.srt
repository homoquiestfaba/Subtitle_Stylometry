1
00:00:29,846 --> 00:00:33,942
It's 7.:00 a.m., children, and you're listening
to Radio-Free Harvard...

2
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:36,077
...on a chilly November morning.

3
00:00:36,186 --> 00:00:39,679
You're at the greatest university on Earth,
and you know what?

4
00:00:40,424 --> 00:00:42,859
You're in over your head. You're drowning.

5
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,228
Especially you seniors.

6
00:00:45,495 --> 00:00:49,728
Only 150 days before your thesis is due
and the powers that be decide...

7
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,736
...whether you're destined
for greatness or mediocrity.

8
00:00:53,737 --> 00:00:55,467
I know what you're thinking.

9
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:57,007
Do I really belong here?

10
00:00:57,774 --> 00:00:59,970
Probably not. But don't give in.

11
00:01:00,043 --> 00:01:01,067
Don't give up.

12
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,908
Arise, fair Harvard.

13
00:01:03,046 --> 00:01:04,036
Arise.

14
00:01:04,248 --> 00:01:06,308
You too can rule the world.

15
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,476
You just have to crush everyone else first.

16
00:01:10,287 --> 00:01:12,415
A little crushing music, Maestro.

17
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:49,684
All right guys, let's go!

18
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:59,161
You can do it. Keep going!

19
00:02:07,077 --> 00:02:09,103
Keep up the pace! Nice and neat!

20
00:02:12,516 --> 00:02:13,882
Ignore him!

21
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:16,787
Move it! Let's go!

22
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:22,653
Very funny, Monty!

23
00:02:29,933 --> 00:02:31,993
Now, here's something to crow about.

24
00:02:32,302 --> 00:02:33,964
I've got a great cock, don't I?
 
25
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:36,871
You see, last night,
a Radcliffe sophomore saw a ghost...

26
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,604
...looking remarkably like Walt Whitman
in Widener Library.

27
00:02:41,345 --> 00:02:44,247
America's greatest poet
haunting the stacks, eh.

28
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:48,518
The Cliffie is undergoing intense debriefing
by the English department.

29
00:02:48,785 --> 00:02:49,912
They better hurry.

30
00:02:49,986 --> 00:02:53,855
Weather tells us that 10 inches of
the white shroud is scheduled for tonight.

31
00:02:54,358 --> 00:02:55,724
I'm Everett Calloway.

32
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:57,693
Now you hear me. Now you....

33
00:02:59,363 --> 00:03:02,026
Your father called
and wants you to call him back.

34
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,499
What's up with Father?

35
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:05,365
Marrying my sister, perhaps.

36
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:08,967
He mumbled something
about your being overdrawn...

37
00:03:09,306 --> 00:03:10,239
again!

38
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,878
I thought he was a patriot.
Doesn't he believe in deficit spending.

39
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,980
Lord Montague!

40
00:03:18,582 --> 00:03:21,609
You're looking very grim and formal
this morning.

41
00:03:22,018 --> 00:03:23,748
You trying to pass for a Yalie?

42
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,320
I've got a meeting with Pitkannan.

43
00:03:26,757 --> 00:03:28,988
Oh, no. Not about the thesis!

44
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,125
- Feeling confident?
- Feeling nauseous.

45
00:03:32,195 --> 00:03:33,424
This one here.

46
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,125
Oh, God.

47
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:39,098
I know her. I've been with her.

48
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,871
First paragraph, Mr. Kessler.

49
00:03:42,606 --> 00:03:44,006
Let's hear it.

50
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,632
''Chapter 1.''

51
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,700
From memory.

52
00:03:47,778 --> 00:03:48,802
Yes, sir!

53
00:03:48,912 --> 00:03:51,381
I don't know whether that denotes
hard work, or...

54
00:03:51,615 --> 00:03:53,106
...unseemly vanity.

55
00:03:53,784 --> 00:03:54,911
Stand up!

56
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,476
Stand up?

57
00:03:57,621 --> 00:03:59,749
I like a substantial target.

58
00:04:06,396 --> 00:04:07,364
''Chapter 1.

59
00:04:08,732 --> 00:04:10,291
''The Bottomless Well of Need.

60
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:14,732
''The noble and ambitious assumption
of the government of the United States...

61
00:04:14,971 --> 00:04:18,203
''...is that the needs of a diverse population
can be fulfilled.

62
00:04:18,775 --> 00:04:22,837
''The dream of a melting pot has become
a cauldron of inflexible minorities...

63
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,975
''...and the hopelessly unemployable.

64
00:04:26,216 --> 00:04:29,709
''The solution is to leave the complexities
of modern government...

65
00:04:29,886 --> 00:04:31,548
''...to the political expert.

66
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:36,156
''And to rethink our naive faith
in the wisdom of the people.''

67
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,460
A good beginning.

68
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,459
Leave your chapter.

69
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,898
And if the rest of your thesis is
as intelligent as you are...

70
00:04:44,334 --> 00:04:47,896
...you are certain to graduate
summa cum laude...

71
00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:50,806
...and that will be the beginning...

72
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,433
...of a brilliant career.

73
00:04:55,312 --> 00:04:56,940
Thank you, Professor Pitkannan.

74
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:04,580
Do you think Helga is
a voluptuous Saint-Emilion...

75
00:05:04,988 --> 00:05:06,456
...or a buttery Chardonnay?

76
00:05:07,491 --> 00:05:10,290
You mean, Helga with the coils.
Works over at Kinko Copy?

77
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,124
That's her. What do you think.

78
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:13,595
What do I think?

79
00:05:14,331 --> 00:05:15,321
Bud Light.

80
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:17,698
That's not funny.

81
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:22,739
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't
demoralize my crew.

82
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:24,968
Face it, you're just not a leader of men.

83
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:26,907
- Very funny.
- Then be a model.

84
00:05:28,712 --> 00:05:30,305
- How'd it go?
- How'd what go.

85
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:33,613
The big meeting
with the god of your idolatry.

86
00:05:33,683 --> 00:05:34,946
With Pitkannan?

87
00:05:35,385 --> 00:05:36,751
It went great.

88
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,079
Rah.

89
00:05:38,355 --> 00:05:39,823
Can't you stay?

90
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,449
The best never rest.

91
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:44,120
- I hate him.
- He is a tad compulsive.

92
00:05:44,194 --> 00:05:46,425
He has to be.
Harvard's not his inheritance.

93
00:05:46,496 --> 00:05:47,623
It's true.

94
00:05:47,797 --> 00:05:49,959
Harvard doesn't have any standards left.

95
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:51,797
They let in anyone who's bright.

96
00:05:52,068 --> 00:05:53,559
I'm worried about him.

97
00:05:54,738 --> 00:05:56,764
Poor guy's the pet of a Nobel Laureate.

98
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,639
Pitkannan spends more time
on Nightline than in lecture.

99
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:01,507
He's a celebrity, not an intellectual.

100
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:04,912
He'll still get Monty into graduate school
and set him up for life.

101
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:06,107
For life.

102
00:06:06,182 --> 00:06:07,741
Sounds like a death sentence.

103
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:25,065
What the hell was that?

104
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,464
Your hard drive is fried.

105
00:06:58,134 --> 00:06:59,602
I got ten chapters printed.

106
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,433
You've done ten chapters already?

107
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,401
I'm going to get Xeroxes.

108
00:07:03,473 --> 00:07:05,840
- Wait until morning.
- It's my only copy.

109
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:08,003
Are you afraid someone will steal it?

110
00:07:08,078 --> 00:07:10,138
I can't take any chances. This is my life.

111
00:07:10,213 --> 00:07:13,149
I know you worked really hard,
but it's not your life, Monty.

112
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,842
- I'm going with him!
- Good!

113
00:07:41,244 --> 00:07:42,576
Monty, wait up!

114
00:07:42,946 --> 00:07:44,676
I didn't ask you to tag along.

115
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,010
You're welcome, you bastard!

116
00:07:47,317 --> 00:07:49,548
Face it, Courtney,
you can't keep up with me.

117
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:57,183
Monty, are you okay?

118
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:00,861

What're you doing?

119
00:08:02,132 --> 00:08:03,896
God. It's down there.

120
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,668
In the boiler room?

121
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:07,203
I got to get into Widener.

122
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,501
Widener is closed. Wait till the morning.

123
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,131
I can't wait till morning!

124
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,765
You're hurt.

125
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:17,470
Would you like my help getting in?

126
00:08:22,452 --> 00:08:24,011
Since you asked so nicely....

127
00:08:24,888 --> 00:08:25,981
Come on.

128
00:08:27,657 --> 00:08:31,185
- Through the front door?
- Yes, through the front. I know the guard.

129
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,754
Hi, Chuck.

130
00:08:35,832 --> 00:08:38,461
Courtney. It's kind of late. You okay?

131
00:08:39,035 --> 00:08:42,597
Yeah. I was here earlier
and I think I misplaced my wallet.

132
00:08:42,672 --> 00:08:44,698
I was wondering if anyone turned it in?

133
00:08:45,575 --> 00:08:48,409
I don't remember
anybody bringing in a wallet but...

134
00:08:48,645 --> 00:08:50,170
...let me take a look.

135
00:08:52,048 --> 00:08:53,949
I found a hat here and...

136
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:55,946
...a scarf...

137
00:08:56,186 --> 00:08:57,745
...and a banana.

138
00:08:58,388 --> 00:09:00,186
What color was that wallet?

139
00:09:00,523 --> 00:09:02,515
It was green. Alligator green.

140
00:09:02,592 --> 00:09:04,959
Alligator green. That's kind of spiffy.

141
00:10:32,248 --> 00:10:33,307
Don't!

142
00:10:38,788 --> 00:10:39,881
Calm down!

143
00:10:43,426 --> 00:10:44,519
It's mine!

144
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:46,994
That's all I want. It's important.

145
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,258
It belongs to me.

146
00:10:48,331 --> 00:10:50,800
Finders keepers, losers weepers.

147
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:53,996
Don't you knock before coming
into someone's home?

148
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,596
- It's not worth anything.
- Why do you want it then?

149
00:10:57,473 --> 00:10:58,270
How much?

150
00:10:58,341 --> 00:11:00,310
- How much?
- Yeah, how much?

151
00:11:00,443 --> 00:11:02,605
- Got a check.
- Is it a certified check.

152
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:05,114
How about a six-month CD?
You got one of those.

153
00:11:05,515 --> 00:11:07,040
I need something I can chew.

154
00:11:07,116 --> 00:11:08,550
Okay. You want food?

155
00:11:09,018 --> 00:11:11,453
I'll bring you some. Then you give me that.

156
00:11:12,789 --> 00:11:14,519
What size underpants you wear?

157
00:11:15,158 --> 00:11:16,057
Excuse me?

158
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,660
I could use a new pair of underpants.

159
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:21,698
I'll bring you underpants.
Just don't burn any more pages.

160
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,598
I'll bring you underpants
and you'll give me my thesis.

161
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:25,691
Your thesis?

162
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:29,262
Is that what this piece of shit's
supposed to be?

163
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:32,235
- What's it supposed to be on, Harvard?
- Government.

164
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:33,374
Government.

165
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:36,242
I didn't recognize you! You're Dan Quayle!

166
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:38,780
You came back to finish your education.

167
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,911
Okay, Harvard. You study government,
so this should be easy.

168
00:11:42,986 --> 00:11:45,251
You want something, I need something.

169
00:11:45,655 --> 00:11:47,317
Go get me a glazed doughnut.

170
00:11:47,891 --> 00:11:48,984
A glazed doughnut?

171
00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:51,220
Make sure the glaze is not all broke.

172
00:11:51,561 --> 00:11:52,859
And your underpants?

173
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:54,488
What about my underpants?

174
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,858
Clean underpants too! That's right!

175
00:11:57,934 --> 00:12:00,403
- Great. Glazed doughnut--
- Pristine, glazed doughnut.

176
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,372
Pristine, glazed doughnut
and underpants. Okay?

177
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:04,700
What do I get?

178
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:08,069
Well, for each thing you get,
I'll give you one page.

179
00:12:08,912 --> 00:12:10,210
- A chapter?
- No.

180
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:11,906
A page is a thing!

181
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,950
A chapter is a whole lot of things.

182
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,649
There are 88 pages in that thesis.

183
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:19,417
There are 83 pages now.

184
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:27,020
Looks I like I found a way to live
through the winter, Harvard.

185
00:12:36,372 --> 00:12:39,706
I hope you got it. I just went through
two years of Lost and Found.

186
00:12:42,211 --> 00:12:43,577
You didn't get it.

187
00:12:45,481 --> 00:12:48,349
All right, all right.
Let's get you to the infirmary.

188
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:52,277
Perfect.

189
00:12:53,156 --> 00:12:54,715
Glaze is almost perfect.

190
00:12:54,824 --> 00:12:56,190
There's no point.

191
00:12:56,259 --> 00:12:57,921
- Who are you calling?
- University cops.

192
00:12:57,994 --> 00:13:00,054
No, let's negotiate.
How much cash do we have?

193
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:01,119
He can't eat money.

194
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,597
Doesn't money buy food?

195
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,827
Helga, you're brilliant!

196
00:13:04,901 --> 00:13:05,766
I love you.

197
00:13:05,835 --> 00:13:07,326
He's probably schizophrenic.

198
00:13:07,403 --> 00:13:09,872
Most homeless are schizophrenics.

199
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:10,838
I have $50.

200
00:13:10,907 --> 00:13:12,705
I can't pay you back soon.

201
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:14,641
I'll call my esteemed father.

202
00:13:14,744 --> 00:13:17,646
If I can convince him
the money's not for me, maybe I...

203
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,239
You don't understand.

204
00:13:19,315 --> 00:13:23,218
This guy could be using my thesis
for toilet paper, or eating it.

205
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,313
He has no respect for himself,
much less for what I'm struggling to do.

206
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,258
He liked tormenting me.
You should've seen the look on his face.

207
00:13:30,326 --> 00:13:31,624
He wants me to fail.

208
00:13:31,694 --> 00:13:34,027
Pitkannan advised Rapp's thesis last year.

209
00:13:34,097 --> 00:13:37,067
He dropped him because
he didn't have a rough draft.

210
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,192
Oh, God!

211
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,735
You need rest. We'll get a fresh doughnut
in the morning.

212
00:13:41,804 --> 00:13:43,033
I won't wait on this--

213
00:13:43,106 --> 00:13:45,405
He doesn't know you.
I'm sure he doesn't want you to fail.

214
00:13:45,475 --> 00:13:47,000
Just reason with him.

215
00:13:47,677 --> 00:13:49,805
Just deal with him like a human being.

216
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:52,474
I know he's a human being. I smelled him.

217
00:13:52,682 --> 00:13:56,175
He's a worthless, stinky, filthy,
useless human being.

218
00:13:56,285 --> 00:13:57,776
Hello, Security?

219
00:14:01,457 --> 00:14:02,823
Watch your step.

220
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,859
You bunch of scavengers!

221
00:14:07,997 --> 00:14:10,557
Thanks for the doughnut, you little stoolie!

222
00:14:11,134 --> 00:14:12,158
Come on.

223
00:14:13,136 --> 00:14:14,661
Hey, Monty, is that him?

224
00:14:15,138 --> 00:14:16,629
He's a little old man.

225
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,803
Officer, it isn't here! Now, where is it?

226
00:14:19,876 --> 00:14:22,209
It's not down there and it's not on him.

227
00:14:27,316 --> 00:14:29,979
You have violated
Cambridge city ordinances...

228
00:14:30,053 --> 00:14:33,217
...and are charged with public intoxication
and/or vagrancy...

229
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,724
...and/or panhandling. If you plead guilty...

230
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,021
...please sit down.

231
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:39,358
If you plead not guilty, take a step forward.

232
00:14:42,532 --> 00:14:43,522
Name?

233
00:14:43,766 --> 00:14:45,257
Simon B. Wilder, Judge.

234
00:14:45,535 --> 00:14:48,130
As a taxpayer, I'd like to request
a trial by jury.

235
00:14:48,771 --> 00:14:51,297
And when was the last time
you paid taxes?

236
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,203
Three times this last week.

237
00:14:53,276 --> 00:14:55,541
- You paid taxes three times?
- Yes, sir.

238
00:14:55,878 --> 00:14:58,541
There's a federal, state
and county tax on wine.

239
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:02,710
Mr. Wilder...

240
00:15:02,785 --> 00:15:05,949
...the court concedes
you have paid various taxes...

241
00:15:06,556 --> 00:15:08,957

...nevertheless a jury trial is not called for.

242
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,784
Charges of public drunkenness,
trespassing and vagrancy stand.

243
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:15,098
- How do you plead?
- Not guilty.

244
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:20,261
You were found living in a furnace room
under Harvard's Widener Library.

245
00:15:20,603 --> 00:15:24,062
With all due respect, sir,
Harvard University is a land-grant school.

246
00:15:24,941 --> 00:15:27,775
Constitutionally,
I was living on public grounds.

247
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,540
I'll drop the trespassing charge...

248
00:15:29,612 --> 00:15:32,514
...but you tested as being drunk
at the time of your arrest.

249
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,944
At the time of my arrest,
I was neither driving an automobile...

250
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:39,250
...or operating heavy farm equipment.
I was sitting alone, reading.

251
00:15:39,322 --> 00:15:40,813
I'm well past drinking age.

252
00:15:40,957 --> 00:15:44,758
If I take a little drink to kill the winter chill,
it's certainly not a crime.

253
00:15:44,827 --> 00:15:49,265
If it were, every fan at a Harvard-Yale
football game would be behind bars. Come on!

254
00:15:52,735 --> 00:15:54,363
Be careful, Mr. Wilder.

255
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,367
You're coming dangerously close
to contempt of court.

256
00:15:57,473 --> 00:15:59,908
I'll drop the charges of public intoxication.

257
00:16:00,409 --> 00:16:02,640
Thank you. You're a gentleman
and a scholar.

258
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,648
I knew once we got to know each other,
we'd hit it off.

259
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:08,708
When I heard that phony accent,
I thought he'd be an asshole.

260
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:11,478
It goes to show--

261
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:12,715
That's it Mr. Wilder!

262
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,414
I'm holding you in contempt.

263
00:16:14,624 --> 00:16:16,149
Fifty dollars or 50 days!

264
00:16:16,325 --> 00:16:19,295
You'll hear from Alan Dershowitz.
See how you do with him!

265
00:16:19,462 --> 00:16:20,361
Your Honor...

266
00:16:20,496 --> 00:16:21,657
...may I pay the fine?

267
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,461
Are you related to Mr. Wilder?

268
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:25,024
I'm a Harvard student.

269
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:26,967
I'm writing my senior thesis and

270
00:16:27,136 --> 00:16:28,661
...I need Mr. Wilder's help.

271
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:31,504
Bailiff, this young man will pay the fine...

272
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:34,174
...provided he gets Mr. Wilder
out of my sight!

273
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:35,703
Next case, please.

274
00:16:35,778 --> 00:16:37,747
Don't ask him for a glazed doughnut.

275
00:16:47,723 --> 00:16:48,986
Excuse me, Miss.

276
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:52,051
Can I borrow your quarter?
I'd like to get the morning paper.

277
00:16:52,895 --> 00:16:54,363
Thank you, sweetheart.

278
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,128
You know what the greatest nation
in the world is? Don’t you?

279
00:16:58,201 --> 00:16:59,999
I hope it's the U.S.A.

280
00:17:00,203 --> 00:17:01,171
Wrong!

281
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:02,569
It's do-nation.

282
00:17:03,172 --> 00:17:05,664
There you go.
That's for being so generous.

283
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,434
Would you like a couple more for your friends?

284
00:17:07,543 --> 00:17:09,171
No, one's fine. Thanks.

285
00:17:09,378 --> 00:17:10,937
Thank you. Bye, sweetheart.

286
00:17:11,013 --> 00:17:13,346
Mr. Wilder, I have a business proposition.

287
00:17:13,749 --> 00:17:15,650
Buy the Boston Herald over here.

288
00:17:15,718 --> 00:17:17,482
Only 25 cents.

289
00:17:17,987 --> 00:17:19,546
Get your paper over here!

290
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,454
Only 25 cents!

291
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:23,658
Read all about it!

292
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:27,196
Clarence Thomas wins appointment!
Moves in on top of hill.

293
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,197
- I'll take one.
- There you go, Miss.

294
00:17:29,265 --> 00:17:31,427
- Let me check that out.
- Twenty-five cents.

295
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:33,497
- Solid.
- It's on Page 5.

296
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:37,103
I bailed you out.
I think that entitles me to a conversation.

297
00:17:37,173 --> 00:17:38,835
Read all about it!

298
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,636
Harvard student dies in freak accident!

299
00:17:41,944 --> 00:17:43,742
Crushed by giant ego!

300
00:17:44,213 --> 00:17:46,011
I'll take the rest. Here's $5.

301
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,248
What do you see when you look at me?

302
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,479
What do you see?

303
00:17:50,553 --> 00:17:51,350
A man.

304
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,149

No, you see a piece of shit.

305
00:17:53,256 --> 00:17:54,849
I see a man who needs a home.

306
00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:56,017
I had a home.

307
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,786
I had a warm place to sleep.

308
00:17:58,227 --> 00:18:00,560
Seventeen bathrooms
and eight miles of books.

309
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,428
I had a goddamn palace.

310
00:18:03,065 --> 00:18:04,829
Do you know why I need a home?

311
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:06,425
'Cause of you.

312
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,862
'Cause when you looked at me,
you didn't see a man.

313
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,280
Well?

314
00:18:25,988 --> 00:18:27,081
What's that?

315
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,115
A house.

316
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:33,719
I prefer that.

317
00:18:33,796 --> 00:18:34,786
It's full.

318
00:18:35,298 --> 00:18:36,789
It's the best I can do.

319
00:18:40,903 --> 00:18:43,771
My roommate, Boz, cracked up
two months ago and quit school.

320
00:18:44,106 --> 00:18:45,233
This is his stuff!

321
00:18:45,308 --> 00:18:46,435
Where is he now?

322
00:18:46,976 --> 00:18:47,966
Bali!

323
00:18:48,311 --> 00:18:51,008

Bali? I've been there. Merchant Marines.

324
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,939
Swab the decks and see the world.

Just don't breathe in the engine room.

325
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:58,951
Well, all this comfort can be yours
for just one senior thesis.

326
00:18:59,288 --> 00:19:00,756

For each night's lodging...

327
00:19:00,823 --> 00:19:01,916
...one page.

328
00:19:01,991 --> 00:19:06,361

Mr. Wilder, I don't think you understand.
This is nine months of my work.

329
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,996
I need all the pages now.

330
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,795
Just give me everything 
and you can stay until spring.

331
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,363
I give you my word.

332
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,698
Your word, Harvard. Surely ye jest.

333
00:19:15,971 --> 00:19:19,806
Did you forget about our original deal?
One thing for one thing.

334
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:23,441

Get a little creative,
you'll have me out of here in no time at all.

335
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,404
By the way...

336
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,052
...I'll need something decent to read.

337
00:19:29,118 --> 00:19:30,984
I'll get anything you want from the library.

338
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,385
I was reading Germinal by Zola
until I was so rudely interrupted.

339
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,116
You'll have it by tomorrow.

340
00:19:38,794 --> 00:19:39,853
Boy, oh, boy.

341
00:19:40,629 --> 00:19:43,121
- Where are you going?
- I got to get dinner.

342
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:46,167
My roommates are cooking dinner.
I'll get you some.

343
00:19:48,237 --> 00:19:50,468
Wait a minute. What are they having?

344
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,808
What are they having?

345
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,944
Hello, Speedy.

346
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:00,247
How was your day?

347
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,513
That good.

348
00:20:03,486 --> 00:20:05,717
- Check that for you.
- Mr. One-Crutch Man.

349
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,815
- The doctor told you to use both crutches?
- I only need one.

350
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:12,157
Don't tell me you're even afraid
to depend on inanimate objects.

351
00:20:12,728 --> 00:20:15,960

Anyone mind if I have seconds.
I'll kick in extra for groceries.

352
00:20:16,031 --> 00:20:17,829
You still owe for last week.

353
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,659
I'm good for it, Jeff.

354
00:20:19,835 --> 00:20:21,599
Can you get the door, please?

355
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,770
You dining on the terrace this evening?

356
00:20:33,616 --> 00:20:35,209
This meet your standards?

357
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,285
When do I get my page?

358
00:20:39,855 --> 00:20:40,845
Tomorrow.

359
00:20:41,056 --> 00:20:43,719
If you eat now, I get my page now.

360
00:20:44,126 --> 00:20:46,891
If you had an insurance policy,
would you carry it around?

361
00:20:46,962 --> 00:20:48,794
You're being very unreasonable.

362
00:20:48,898 --> 00:20:50,662
How do I know you didn't burn it?

363
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:52,361
Do you think I'm an idiot?

364
00:20:52,968 --> 00:20:54,231
No, Harvard.

365
00:20:54,403 --> 00:20:55,803
I think you're a loser.

366
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:02,876
Fine!

367
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,780
Tomorrow then. 'Bye.

368
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,247
What if my parents pull
one of their surprise visits?

369
00:21:14,323 --> 00:21:16,485
My mom would have a heart attack.
I mean....

370
00:21:17,927 --> 00:21:21,659
Wouldn't it have been more considerate
if you had asked Jeff's mother first?

371
00:21:22,231 --> 00:21:25,690
Don't lecture me about consideration.
You keep a rooster in the house.

372
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,633
My cock is a lot cleaner than your bum.

373
00:21:28,804 --> 00:21:31,000
You're comparing cocks and bums.

374
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,540
Is this inside macho talk.

375
00:21:32,842 --> 00:21:35,812
The rooster happens to be
the centerpiece of my radio show.

376
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,040
The bum is the centerpiece of my life.

377
00:21:38,113 --> 00:21:39,706
The bum is my summa cum laude.

378
00:21:39,782 --> 00:21:43,082
Does anyone have a razor?
My legs are turning into Christmas trees.

379
00:21:45,354 --> 00:21:47,186
Come on, we're all guys here.

380
00:21:47,256 --> 00:21:48,519
What's the occasion?

381
00:21:49,425 --> 00:21:53,021
I got a date. Promised Jonathan
I'd make up with him again.

382
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,959
Jonathan? The Face.

383
00:21:55,331 --> 00:21:58,233
He's not just a pretty face,
he's also a great body.

384
00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:01,068
Can we just not talk about sex right now?

385
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,833
You forgot to take your girlfriend home
this morning...

386
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:06,239
...so I took the air out
and put her in the closet.

387
00:22:06,308 --> 00:22:07,367
Take my blade.

388
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:11,144
Remember, if you tire of The Face...

389
00:22:11,213 --> 00:22:12,704
...Helga's got a brother.

390
00:22:15,384 --> 00:22:16,647
How's the view?

391
00:22:18,687 --> 00:22:19,780
This won't work.

392
00:22:19,955 --> 00:22:22,584
Look, I've been working on this
since junior year.

393
00:22:22,658 --> 00:22:26,288
I'm not going to just start again
because a bum is holding it hostage.

394
00:22:26,662 --> 00:22:30,394
He'll get it tonight and I'll talk him
into giving me the whole thing.

395
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,659
Yeah, you've done a great job so far.

396
00:22:32,735 --> 00:22:35,933
- I thought you said he wants a home.
- Look, I'll handle it.

397
00:22:36,171 --> 00:22:37,469
Okay? Okay, Jeff?

398
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,933
I'll have him out in a couple of days.
Just cut me some slack.

399
00:22:45,347 --> 00:22:46,815
Keep an eye on him.

400
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:52,454
Go get her, Monty. Go get her.

401
00:22:54,423 --> 00:22:55,891
We should call your mother.

402
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:04,899
He'll freeze in that wreck.
I got extra blankets. Go give them to him.

403
00:23:05,067 --> 00:23:07,764
- I don't want him to be too comfortable.
- He could die.

404
00:23:07,836 --> 00:23:09,031
No such luck.

405
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:11,907
You're not really like this, are you?

406
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:14,375
Please tell me this hard-hearted jerk
isn't you.

407
00:23:14,543 --> 00:23:16,978
Give up on me.
I'm tired of disappointing you!

408
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:20,843
Then do it out of self-interest.
You want to be a diplomat, right.

409
00:23:21,283 --> 00:23:22,444
Secretary of state.

410
00:23:22,518 --> 00:23:26,614
Even Pitkannan would offer a hostile power
a few blankets to establish good will.

411
00:23:27,456 --> 00:23:28,617
Don't cut yourself.

412
00:23:33,395 --> 00:23:35,864
I never wanted to be a razor so bad
in my life!

413
00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:51,869
Here!

414
00:23:52,448 --> 00:23:54,144
It's your namesake's work.

415
00:23:54,216 --> 00:23:58,051
Somebody spotted you in the library.
Thought you were Walt Whitman's ghost.

416
00:24:01,557 --> 00:24:03,219
Van's actually mine, you know.

417
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:05,528
I loaned my ex-roommate a fortune

418
00:24:05,594 --> 00:24:07,062
And he fled to Bali.

419
00:24:08,163 --> 00:24:09,256
And I got the van.

420
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:10,829
Why don't you sell it?

421
00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:12,731
- The engine doesn't run.
- So fix it.

422
00:24:13,168 --> 00:24:14,898
- Want me to do it?
- Oh, sure.

423
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,570
- You a mechanic?
- No.

424
00:24:16,639 --> 00:24:18,835
I'm a Zen Buddhist,
but that's close enough.

425
00:24:19,575 --> 00:24:22,443
How many bottles of that wine
will you give me if I fix it?

426
00:24:22,645 --> 00:24:24,273
To get this thing running.

427
00:24:24,813 --> 00:24:25,644
Six!

428
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:26,443
Eight!

429
00:24:26,515 --> 00:24:27,244
Seven!

430
00:24:27,316 --> 00:24:28,045
Eight!

431
00:24:28,117 --> 00:24:29,847
Nine, but that's my final offer.

432
00:24:30,586 --> 00:24:32,782
Didn't you used to run a savings and loan?

433
00:24:33,022 --> 00:24:34,888
No, you're thinking of my father.

434
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,024
Look, you want a little something
in advance?

435
00:24:38,627 --> 00:24:42,029
Boy, oh, boy. You must be one
of the great minds of your generation.

436
00:24:42,331 --> 00:24:43,799
You got a corky screw?

437
00:26:23,065 --> 00:26:24,863
Hey, boy, here we go.

438
00:26:26,568 --> 00:26:29,470
For lodgings and meals
and two extra for the blanket.

439
00:26:30,205 --> 00:26:32,071
Thanks. Thanks a lot...

440
00:26:32,207 --> 00:26:34,176
...but the blanket was just...

441
00:26:35,711 --> 00:26:36,770
...good will.

442
00:26:37,412 --> 00:26:38,744
I'll carry your books.

443
00:26:38,814 --> 00:26:40,180
What'll that cost me?

444
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,315
- It's for the blanket.
- You didn't ask for it...

445
00:26:43,385 --> 00:26:45,115
...so the blanket doesn't count.

446
00:26:45,454 --> 00:26:47,514
I appreciated it, okay?

447
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,957
Would you appreciate it
if I carry your books?

448
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:57,060
Boy, oh, boy, we're in business.

449
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,129
Come on, boy.

450
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:05,367
Keep it up, Hoppy. Let's go.

451
00:27:08,243 --> 00:27:11,111
- Here we are, back where you found me.
- Don't remind me.

452
00:27:11,413 --> 00:27:13,814
I wonder what it's like to read upstairs.

453
00:27:14,783 --> 00:27:16,274
Bet the light is better.

454
00:28:07,369 --> 00:28:08,769
Germinal, right?

455
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,473
This library is like a church, isn't it?

456
00:28:15,177 --> 00:28:19,080
When you were in church, did you wonder
what other people are praying for?

457
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:21,982
Did someone die? Was someone just born?

458
00:28:22,517 --> 00:28:24,247
Library's like that for me.

459
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,714
Sir, you can't stay in here.

460
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:30,221
It's okay. He's with me.
He's part of my research project.

461
00:28:30,726 --> 00:28:32,126
I beg your pardon.

462
00:28:37,733 --> 00:28:39,429
Women, ain't they perfect?

463
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:40,591
Not always.

464
00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:42,467
Yes, they are. They're perfect.

465
00:28:42,537 --> 00:28:45,200

Don't matter if they're skinny, fat,
blonde or blue.

466
00:28:45,374 --> 00:28:47,843
If a woman is willing to give you her love...

467
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,936
...it's the greatest gift in the world.

468
00:28:50,012 --> 00:28:53,005
Makes you taller, smarter.
Makes your teeth shine.

469
00:28:53,081 --> 00:28:54,845
Boy, oh, boy. Women are perfect.

470
00:28:54,917 --> 00:28:58,251
- Keep your voice low.
- Perfect joy and perfect ache.

471
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,016
Joy when you first see
and get to know them...

472
00:29:01,089 --> 00:29:02,682
...ache when you leave them.

473
00:29:02,758 --> 00:29:06,388
Joy, ache. Joy-ache.
Joy-ache. Joy-ache....

474
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,960
If you keep your voice low,
then you wouldn't attract attention.

475
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:30,318
I'll give you two pages for a bath.

476
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,582
Okay. Let me get some work done.

477
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,208
Why'd you say I was a loser?
Sssssssssssssssssshhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!! 

478
00:30:08,256 --> 00:30:10,248
The pot calling the kettle black.

479
00:30:12,928 --> 00:30:14,521
I'm not a loser, Harvard.

480
00:30:14,997 --> 00:30:16,260
I'm a quitter.

481
00:30:16,765 --> 00:30:18,165
You try too hard.

482
00:30:19,501 --> 00:30:21,561
Winners forget they're in a race.

483
00:30:22,037 --> 00:30:23,596
They just love to run.

484
00:30:26,808 --> 00:30:28,800
''Mine eyes have seen the glory

485
00:30:29,144 --> 00:30:31,613
''Of the coming of the Lord

486
00:30:38,887 --> 00:30:41,186
''He has loosened up the panties

487
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,691
''Of the little whore next door

488
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:51,990
''His truth is marching on''

489
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,136
Okay. He cannot stay, so get him out.

490
00:30:57,239 --> 00:31:00,209
Water doesn't cost anything.
I'll buy you more bubble bath.

491
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:03,404
I am not taking a bath in there.
Did you give him a key?

492
00:31:03,845 --> 00:31:05,837
I spent the day with him. He's harmless.

493
00:31:05,914 --> 00:31:08,042
He likes to read. He likes to talk,
once you get him going.

494
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,813
I cannot take this right now.
I can't. I just can't.

495
00:31:11,053 --> 00:31:12,851
I'm not going to make Med School.

496
00:31:12,921 --> 00:31:16,517
I'm at Harvard, I'm not going to make
Med School. Can you believe that?

497
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,428
I've got one page of my thesis.

498
00:31:20,228 --> 00:31:24,222
What. I heard you printing last week.
It sounded like you had 50 or 60 pages.

499
00:31:24,433 --> 00:31:25,526
Blanks.

500
00:31:26,501 --> 00:31:28,060
I printed out blanks.

501
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,771
I didn't want you guys to know.

502
00:31:32,874 --> 00:31:34,843
And I thought I was wound tight.

503
00:31:35,343 --> 00:31:37,869
Just get him out.
I cannot work with him around.

504
00:31:37,946 --> 00:31:40,677
What if my mom comes? She will.
She'll check on me.

505
00:31:40,749 --> 00:31:43,480
Calm down. This is scary.
You're sounding like Boz.

506
00:31:43,552 --> 00:31:45,817
- I'm nothing like Boz.
- Who's like Boz?

507
00:31:45,887 --> 00:31:48,584
Boz. I thought Boz was in Bali, by golly.

508
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,785
He's wearing my robe!

509
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,322
And it smells terrific.

510
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,653
I left clothes out for you.

511
00:31:55,931 --> 00:31:57,559
I only came down for a beer.

512
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,760
I can't get dressed without one.

513
00:31:59,935 --> 00:32:01,096
Little quirk I got.

514
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,263
This is totally out of control.

515
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:06,433
What's wrong. Did you wake up
on the wrong side of the bed?

516
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:08,200
Is this a lover's quarrel?

517
00:32:08,276 --> 00:32:09,608
Maybe I should leave.

518
00:32:09,744 --> 00:32:13,181
We're not lovers, we're roommates
and we respect each other's space.

519
00:32:13,248 --> 00:32:15,217
You respect each other's empty air?

520
00:32:15,283 --> 00:32:17,582
That's very profound for Harvard students.

521
00:32:17,652 --> 00:32:18,585
Let's go.

522
00:32:19,654 --> 00:32:20,678
My robe!

523
00:32:21,623 --> 00:32:25,390
If that's how you feel about it,
don't you wear any of my things!

524
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,389
Just keep it.

525
00:32:30,632 --> 00:32:33,727
I think there's entirely too much bickering
in this house.

526
00:32:33,835 --> 00:32:37,237
I don't know if I can live here!
I hope my summer place is ready soon.

527
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:40,304
Then you'll probably miss me
and don't come begging.

528
00:32:43,245 --> 00:32:46,738
I know. I have a plan.
I'm taking him to Social Security.

529
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:49,215
I'll get him disability benefits, all right?

530
00:32:50,118 --> 00:32:52,212
I expect you to clean the bathtub.

531
00:32:54,956 --> 00:32:55,855
Name.

532
00:32:56,191 --> 00:32:57,318
Simon Wilder!

533
00:32:57,492 --> 00:32:58,721
Who is Simon Wilder?

534
00:32:58,927 --> 00:32:59,758
He is!
He is!

535
00:32:59,828 --> 00:33:01,922
Cut it out! He is!

536
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,395
- Are you Simon Wilder?
- I used to be.

537
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,690
DOB.

538
00:33:07,169 --> 00:33:08,330
E-F-G-H-I-J!

539
00:33:09,838 --> 00:33:12,330
Date of birth. When were you born?

540
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:16,375
When the moon was full,
I was abandoned by my mommy.

541
00:33:17,212 --> 00:33:19,943
I was raised by a she-wolf
in a Wyoming cave.

542
00:33:20,148 --> 00:33:23,016
Come on. This'll get you money.
You need money.

543
00:33:23,885 --> 00:33:25,410
I don't. You do.

544
00:33:25,687 --> 00:33:26,711
I'll ask again.

545
00:33:26,788 --> 00:33:28,381
Do you have evidence of birth?

546
00:33:28,456 --> 00:33:30,049
I'm sitting here, ain't I?

547
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:32,959
What do you think I happened by,
spontaneous combustion?

548
00:33:33,028 --> 00:33:34,587
He's not cooperating.

549
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:37,232
- What state were you born in?
- Infancy.

550
00:33:37,566 --> 00:33:38,795
I'm trying to help.

551
00:33:39,568 --> 00:33:41,093
You see this face, lady.

552
00:33:41,203 --> 00:33:44,833
Memorize it. Some day
this boy's going to save the world.

553
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:48,008
I'm sorry. If he's uncooperative,
there's nothing I can do.

554
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,643
I guess that's why you work here.

555
00:33:51,913 --> 00:33:53,643
Can I have one of these muffins?

556
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:54,939
No!

557
00:33:55,517 --> 00:33:56,917
I'm sorry. No.

558
00:33:57,185 --> 00:34:00,019
Can't even get a muffin.
How're you going to get cash?

559
00:34:00,355 --> 00:34:01,584
What're you doing.

560
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,955
If you're in line for muffins,
you're wasting your time.

561
00:34:05,026 --> 00:34:06,688
They're not giving any out.

562
00:34:09,431 --> 00:34:11,730
What are you doing? We made a deal!

563
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:14,029
I kept my part of it. I went in, didn't I?

564
00:34:14,169 --> 00:34:17,731
What difference does it make if the money
comes from me or the government?

565
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:20,674
The difference is I got a grievance
against the government.

566
00:34:20,742 --> 00:34:23,211
It's your money. You paid into the system.

567
00:34:23,445 --> 00:34:28,281
You said you worked. Sailor, lumberjack,
short-order cook. Or was that bullshit.

568
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,118
There you go. Excuse me.

569
00:34:34,923 --> 00:34:37,324
Well, are we going to the movie, or what?

570
00:34:39,027 --> 00:34:40,689
A deal is a deal, Harvard.

571
00:34:58,113 --> 00:34:59,945
Can I borrow some condoms?

572
00:35:00,215 --> 00:35:01,945
No, but you can have some.

573
00:35:03,385 --> 00:35:04,751
An endurance test.

574
00:35:04,819 --> 00:35:06,310
More like a pop quiz.

575
00:35:06,988 --> 00:35:09,685
Oh, Courtney! Have a good night.

576
00:35:10,158 --> 00:35:11,387
Good night, Monty.

577
00:35:11,459 --> 00:35:13,325
Are you expecting an invasion?

578
00:35:13,395 --> 00:35:15,455
I don't want to be murdered in my bed.

579
00:35:15,797 --> 00:35:18,357
Your bed is the one place
you're totally safe.

580
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:28,135
Are you going to watch him all night?

581
00:35:30,412 --> 00:35:31,937
Locking your girlfriend in.

582
00:35:33,648 --> 00:35:35,344
Good night, little ones.

583
00:35:55,003 --> 00:35:56,335
Give me some books.

584
00:35:56,438 --> 00:35:59,306
I'm perfectly capable
of carrying my own books, thank you.

585
00:36:08,049 --> 00:36:09,017
Here!

586
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,211
Chapter 2.

587
00:36:10,652 --> 00:36:11,642
I read it.

588
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,319
That stuff is coming out the wrong end.

589
00:36:14,522 --> 00:36:16,081
I'm sorry you didn't like it.

590
00:36:16,324 --> 00:36:18,987
This isn't just some term paper,
this is my life!

591
00:36:20,295 --> 00:36:23,356
- Your life is a bunch of papers?
- I know it sounds pathetic...

592
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,401
...but my dream is to get into government
and help people.

593
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:29,435
You think those ideas will help people?

594
00:36:29,871 --> 00:36:31,806
It's a bunch of pessimistic junk!

595
00:36:33,174 --> 00:36:34,938
That's not going to help.

596
00:36:35,176 --> 00:36:36,371
That's giving up!

597
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,937
The best professor here happens to think
that this has promise.

598
00:36:40,348 --> 00:36:41,941
His opinion, not yours!

599
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,448
That's my life!

600
00:36:44,886 --> 00:36:46,445
Wait a minute, Harvard.

601
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,784
Let me show you my life.

602
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,598
There it is. That's my life.

603
00:36:57,832 --> 00:36:59,926
I got this one on a beach in Bali.

604
00:37:00,902 --> 00:37:02,734
Best night's sleep I ever had.

605
00:37:03,772 --> 00:37:05,764
You remember one night of sleep?

606
00:37:06,674 --> 00:37:08,302
The last good one I had.

607
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:12,405
What's this shiny white one?

608
00:37:13,548 --> 00:37:14,811
Yeah, that one.

609
00:37:16,518 --> 00:37:17,508
A woman.

610
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:18,745
Who was she?

611
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:20,811
The one.

612
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,552
The one true love.

613
00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:27,051
How about that. You're a romantic.

614
00:37:27,896 --> 00:37:29,797
All quitters are romantic, Harvard.

615
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:36,198
Each stone tells a story
that I want to remember.

616
00:37:36,971 --> 00:37:39,839
All I do is hold them in my hands
and rub them.

617
00:37:40,875 --> 00:37:43,003
And, abracadabra, I'm back there.

618
00:37:45,613 --> 00:37:47,047
Give me your books.

619
00:37:57,459 --> 00:37:59,052
Tell me about the woman.

620
00:37:59,127 --> 00:38:00,493
- I can't.
- Why not?

621
00:38:01,062 --> 00:38:02,621
I'm not holding the stone.

622
00:38:06,668 --> 00:38:08,660
Let's sit down. There's a bench.

623
00:38:14,075 --> 00:38:16,840
I actually come here sometimes
when the weather's warm.

624
00:38:18,246 --> 00:38:19,544
Beautiful, ain't it?

625
00:38:19,948 --> 00:38:22,417
I got a friend sleeps on that bench
over there.

626
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:24,914
I like to study outside.

627
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,143
Study?

628
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:30,548
What happened to you?
Didn't your father ever play ball with you?

629
00:38:32,827 --> 00:38:34,489
Let's go, if we want to eat.

630
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:37,355
Relax, take a breather.

631
00:38:38,433 --> 00:38:41,562
You didn't answer my question.
Didn't he ever play with you?

632
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:43,632
My past isn't part of our deal.

633
00:38:45,874 --> 00:38:47,103
Excuse me.

634
00:38:51,613 --> 00:38:53,980
You still don't think I'm human, do you?

635
00:38:58,953 --> 00:39:00,615
There's nothing to tell.

636
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,152
My father left when I was 5.

637
00:39:04,058 --> 00:39:07,586
He left my mother to live with
another woman and he had kids with her.

638
00:39:08,062 --> 00:39:11,464
When I got into Harvard he wrote
and told me how proud he was of me...

639
00:39:11,533 --> 00:39:13,934
...and he was sorry
he couldn't help with tuition.

640
00:39:14,002 --> 00:39:16,938
That was the last time I heard from him,
'cause he died.

641
00:39:20,308 --> 00:39:21,674
My mom's terrific!

642
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:24,104
Uncle Bill took me to Little League.

643
00:39:25,313 --> 00:39:26,474
Piece of cake.

644
00:39:27,181 --> 00:39:29,116
Doesn't sound too tough. Was it?

645
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:33,944
No.

646
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:37,183
What about you?

647
00:39:38,326 --> 00:39:40,420
How long were you
in the Merchant Marine?

648
00:39:42,864 --> 00:39:44,628
None of your goddamn business.

649
00:40:01,049 --> 00:40:03,382
- Where were you before Harvard?
- Princeton.

650
00:40:03,451 --> 00:40:06,888
I was hanging out with Al Einstein!
I kind of inspired him!

651
00:40:07,255 --> 00:40:09,952
He got stuck on some formula
so I told him!

652
00:40:10,024 --> 00:40:13,552
''You got a steady job, your wife loves you,
don't make yourself crazy.

653
00:40:13,628 --> 00:40:15,221
''Everything's relative.''

654
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:48,425
There you are, Mr. Fuel Pump,
good as new.

655
00:40:52,567 --> 00:40:54,365
Just in time. Breakfast.

656
00:40:55,737 --> 00:40:57,501
There you go, boy. One page.

657
00:40:58,172 --> 00:40:59,196
What is this?

658
00:40:59,474 --> 00:41:00,601
Oatmeal.

659
00:41:01,009 --> 00:41:02,671
Roughage. It's good for you.

660
00:41:03,344 --> 00:41:04,744
It's good for a horse.

661
00:41:05,246 --> 00:41:06,908
Give me that page back. Here!

662
00:41:07,415 --> 00:41:09,748
Eat up, Simon. Got a big surprise for you.

663
00:41:10,852 --> 00:41:12,821
Our founding fathers...

664
00:41:13,621 --> 00:41:16,056
...or to be politically correct...

665
00:41:16,124 --> 00:41:18,150
...our founding parents...

666
00:41:19,861 --> 00:41:22,797
...designed the Constitution
to prevent the presidency...

667
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:25,559
...from becoming another form of tyranny...

668
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:28,336
...an elected king.

669
00:41:29,837 --> 00:41:30,805
Well?

670
00:41:31,205 --> 00:41:32,605
Did they succeed?

671
00:41:32,674 --> 00:41:33,937
I smell an ambush.

672
00:41:34,008 --> 00:41:35,135
Miss Moore...

673
00:41:35,843 --> 00:41:37,402
...do you have an answer?

674
00:41:40,682 --> 00:41:42,844
The president is not an elected king.

675
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:43,941
Indeed.

676
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,781
Could the president of the United States...

677
00:41:46,854 --> 00:41:49,289
...without consulting those he governs...

678
00:41:50,058 --> 00:41:52,857
...more or less destroy the entire world?

679
00:41:54,062 --> 00:41:55,257
I guess he could.

680
00:41:55,663 --> 00:41:57,097
You guess he could.

681
00:41:57,331 --> 00:42:00,199
Could Julius Caesar have done that?
Could Napoleon?

682
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,233
Could Adolf Hitler?

683
00:42:03,237 --> 00:42:04,603
But they tried to.

684
00:42:05,173 --> 00:42:07,039
Aren't you making a false analogy?

685
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:09,077
Oh, this is my lucky day.

686
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:13,305
I ask a question
and I get a question in response.

687
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,743
You do belong in government, my dear.

688
00:42:17,385 --> 00:42:18,683
Sit down, please.

689
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:22,816
Does anyone have an answer for me,
instead of a quiz?

690
00:42:23,424 --> 00:42:24,722
Don't be a hero, boy.

691
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,489
Mr. Kessler, your thoughts.

692
00:42:28,429 --> 00:42:30,523
The president can't bomb without reason.

693
00:42:30,598 --> 00:42:34,057
He has a reason. He thinks we need
more parking spaces.

694
00:42:35,737 --> 00:42:38,172
The point is, can he destroy the world?

695
00:42:38,506 --> 00:42:39,804
Not without Congress.

696
00:42:39,874 --> 00:42:42,605
Mr. Kessler, after four years of Harvard...

697
00:42:42,744 --> 00:42:44,713

...has it escaped your attention...

698
00:42:44,779 --> 00:42:49,046
...that the president can make war
for 90 days without consulting Congress.

699
00:42:51,586 --> 00:42:52,952
That's right.

700
00:42:53,354 --> 00:42:54,754
Thank you very much.

701
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:57,724
At least I'm going to pass this course.

702
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,292
Sit down, please.

703
00:43:01,596 --> 00:43:03,792
My question still stands.

704
00:43:04,899 --> 00:43:08,358
What is the particular genius
of the Constitution?

705
00:43:08,436 --> 00:43:10,462
- Nice try, General Custer.
- Shut up!

706
00:43:11,405 --> 00:43:13,169
I told you not to get up there.

707
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:15,674
- I told you not to be a hero.
- You promised to be quiet.

708
00:43:15,743 --> 00:43:18,941
- I told you not to stand up.
- You can't talk. This is a lecture.

709
00:43:19,947 --> 00:43:20,937
You, sir!!

710
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:21,812
Who, me?

711
00:43:21,883 --> 00:43:24,114
Yes, do you have an opinion on this.

712
00:43:24,218 --> 00:43:25,083
No.

713
00:43:25,153 --> 00:43:27,247
Are you a student in this class?

714
00:43:27,555 --> 00:43:28,488
No.

715
00:43:28,556 --> 00:43:29,649
Are you a guest?

716
00:43:31,993 --> 00:43:33,120
No, I'm a bum.

717
00:43:34,595 --> 00:43:35,927
There are no bums.

718
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,794
There are only the ''financially challenged.''

719
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,500
No, I'm a bum.

720
00:43:41,803 --> 00:43:43,669
But bear in mind, I'm a Harvard bum.

721
00:43:44,405 --> 00:43:48,137
You must be the logical result
of an open admissions policy.

722
00:43:49,911 --> 00:43:52,039
No, sir, my presence here...

723
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,250
...is a logical result of the search
for edible garbage.

724
00:43:55,449 --> 00:43:57,008
You're here for the garbage?

725
00:43:57,251 --> 00:43:59,982
That's right.
Colleges produce a lot of garbage.

726
00:44:00,755 --> 00:44:02,849
And Harvard produces more than most.

727
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,060
What wit.

728
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,796
Inspired, no doubt, by...

729
00:44:09,997 --> 00:44:11,260
...Wild Turkey.

730
00:44:12,934 --> 00:44:14,425
You ask for charity...

731
00:44:15,036 --> 00:44:17,972
...pleading that society has failed you
and you need help.

732
00:44:18,306 --> 00:44:21,799
But, actually, you're quite capable
and what you really want is...

733
00:44:22,343 --> 00:44:23,971
...alcoholic bliss.

734
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:32,853
I'd rather drink rubbing alcohol
than listen to you, if that's what you mean.

735
00:44:33,321 --> 00:44:37,952
And according to the 21st Amendment,
you can drink anything you want.

736
00:44:42,496 --> 00:44:43,964
Which door do I leave from.

737
00:44:44,031 --> 00:44:47,524
At Harvard, we don't end our sentences
with prepositions.

738
00:44:48,302 --> 00:44:51,795
Well, in that case,
which door do I leave from, asshole.

739
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:57,038
What democratic eloquence!

740
00:44:59,413 --> 00:45:01,814
You asked the question, sir.
Let me answer it.

741
00:45:02,483 --> 00:45:06,045
The genius of the Constitution is
that it can always be changed.

742
00:45:06,554 --> 00:45:08,546
The genius of the Constitution...

743
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:11,115
...is that it makes no permanent rule
other than its faith...

744
00:45:11,192 --> 00:45:13,991
...in the wisdom of ordinary people
to govern themselves.

745
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:16,029
Faith in the wisdom of the people...

746
00:45:16,497 --> 00:45:21,458
...is exactly what makes the Constitution
incomplete and crude.

747
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:23,360
Crude.

748
00:45:23,771 --> 00:45:28,232
No, sir. Our founding parents were
pompous, middle-aged white farmers...

749
00:45:28,609 --> 00:45:30,475
...but they were also great men...

750
00:45:30,544 --> 00:45:33,412
...because they knew one thing
that all great men should know!

751
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:35,245
That they didn't know everything.

752
00:45:35,449 --> 00:45:39,284
They knew they'd make mistakes,
but they left a way to correct them.

753
00:45:39,854 --> 00:45:42,153
They didn't think of themselves as leaders.

754
00:45:42,356 --> 00:45:45,986
They wanted a government
of citizens, not royalty.

755
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:49,297
A government of listeners, not lecturers.

756
00:45:49,864 --> 00:45:52,459
A government that could change,
not stand still.

757
00:45:53,868 --> 00:45:58,329
The president isn't an elected king,
no matter how many bombs he can drop...

758
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,204
...because the crude Constitution
doesn't trust him.

759
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,808
He's a servant of the people.

760
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:07,744
He's a bum, okay, Mr. Pitkannan.

761
00:46:08,983 --> 00:46:10,383
He's just a bum.

762
00:46:11,419 --> 00:46:13,513
The only bliss he's searching for is...

763
00:46:14,088 --> 00:46:15,147
...freedom...

764
00:46:15,489 --> 00:46:16,650
and justice!

765
00:46:36,444 --> 00:46:37,503
I'm sorry, sir.

766
00:46:46,454 --> 00:46:49,151
Hey, Simon, are you okay? What can I do?

767
00:46:58,332 --> 00:46:59,322
I'm fine.

768
00:47:02,837 --> 00:47:05,136
Now that I've taught at Harvard, boy...

769
00:47:05,706 --> 00:47:07,504
...it's all downhill from here.

770
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:24,121
Court.

771
00:47:24,191 --> 00:47:28,686
Do you think Debby is a seductive
Pinot Noir, or a nutty Cabernet?

772
00:47:29,296 --> 00:47:31,060
Debby. What happened to Helga?

773
00:47:31,499 --> 00:47:32,728
I love them both.

774
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:36,302
When'll you realize women are more
than just fermented grape juice?

775
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:39,099
When'll you realize men are more
than just pieces of meat?

776
00:47:39,173 --> 00:47:40,801
The day I become a vegetarian.

777
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:44,143
Listen, it's supposed to go
below zero tonight.

778
00:47:44,211 --> 00:47:46,339
Is it okay if he sleeps in the cellar tonight?

779
00:47:46,414 --> 00:47:47,643
- Sure.
- No problem.

780
00:47:48,049 --> 00:47:49,039
No problem.

781
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:52,315
There's a big problem.
I am sick of paying my share of....

782
00:47:52,386 --> 00:47:56,517
Paying extra to live with a rooster
and a bum, while I want to study.

783
00:47:56,757 --> 00:48:00,091
Bring him inside the house and I leave.
Me and my share of the rent.

784
00:48:00,161 --> 00:48:01,288
Then leave.

785
00:48:02,063 --> 00:48:03,122
I'm serious.

786
00:48:03,764 --> 00:48:05,528
Are you going to cover my rent?

787
00:48:08,035 --> 00:48:10,163
I'd love to help you out, but I'm broke.

788
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:12,064
My old man cut me off.

789
00:48:13,374 --> 00:48:15,502
Not that I ever want to see Jeff leave.

790
00:48:15,576 --> 00:48:16,600
Ever!

791
00:48:16,911 --> 00:48:19,471
- No problem.
- Just take one portion, okay? Just one.

792
00:48:20,114 --> 00:48:21,104
You shit!

793
00:48:22,116 --> 00:48:24,176
- He's a human being.
- Don't give me that!

794
00:48:24,251 --> 00:48:26,584
You just want your thesis.
You care about him.

795
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:28,145
Take him to a shelter!

796
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,402
Jesus Christ!

797
00:48:55,116 --> 00:48:56,015
Here!

798
00:48:56,117 --> 00:48:58,609
- I'm just practicing.
- It's not a funny joke.

799
00:48:58,819 --> 00:49:00,287
Who said it was a joke?

800
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:04,723
Where's the blanket I gave you?

801
00:49:04,892 --> 00:49:06,520
I loaned it to a friend.

802
00:49:06,927 --> 00:49:08,054
In this cold?

803
00:49:08,395 --> 00:49:09,693
What are friends for?

804
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:13,397
I'll get you another one.

805
00:49:14,435 --> 00:49:16,427
I wish this thing's heater worked.

806
00:49:17,338 --> 00:49:20,035
Me too. Then my life would be perfect.

807
00:49:23,744 --> 00:49:24,677
Well...

808
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:29,616
...I'll double my normal payment...

809
00:49:29,817 --> 00:49:31,683
...for a little spot in the cellar.

810
00:49:33,888 --> 00:49:35,789
The cellar's flooded and....

811
00:49:37,124 --> 00:49:40,822
I'd put you in the living room
but Jeff's parents might come over tonight.

812
00:49:44,331 --> 00:49:45,390
Sure, I know.

813
00:49:59,713 --> 00:50:00,737
I know.

814
00:50:25,472 --> 00:50:26,804
What are you thinking?

815
00:50:29,476 --> 00:50:32,207
I'm thinking, ''Why am n here
and he's out there. ''

816
00:50:43,591 --> 00:50:45,025
I've never seen you like this.

817
00:50:45,092 --> 00:50:47,493
You look like you're
about to burst into tears.

818
00:50:51,232 --> 00:50:52,791
Don't hold your breath.

819
00:51:58,832 --> 00:52:00,926
''You lied again, Harvard. Deal's off.''

820
00:52:28,095 --> 00:52:29,188
Stop!

821
00:52:30,364 --> 00:52:31,354
Shit!!

822
00:52:31,799 --> 00:52:33,859
Separation anxiety from your cast.

823
00:52:34,435 --> 00:52:36,961
I thought it'd go a lot quicker with it off,
but I can't concentrate!

824
00:52:37,037 --> 00:52:40,405
I can't print out. I can't even read!
I'll never get this done.

825
00:52:42,810 --> 00:52:44,210
It's not your problem.

826
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,539
Really. What is my problem.

827
00:52:48,482 --> 00:52:49,541
You miss him!

828
00:52:50,884 --> 00:52:52,182
Don't be ridiculous.

829
00:53:06,567 --> 00:53:07,557
Gorky.

830
00:53:12,339 --> 00:53:13,432
Stupid bird!!

831
00:53:21,415 --> 00:53:23,441
Good morning. Are you awake?

832
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:25,382
Everett, come and get your rooster!

833
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:26,953
Close your eyes.

834
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:28,318
All right, no peeking.

835
00:53:28,389 --> 00:53:30,324
Nope. No peeking.

836
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,325
Open your eyes.

837
00:53:41,068 --> 00:53:42,366
Merry Christmas.

838
00:53:47,708 --> 00:53:49,301
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

839
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:50,837
Merry Christmas.

840
00:53:53,981 --> 00:53:55,916
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

841
00:53:56,350 --> 00:53:59,286
Gorky, I want you to take good care
of Lord Montague...

842
00:53:59,386 --> 00:54:01,514
...while we're away on Christmas break.

843
00:54:01,922 --> 00:54:04,653
Are you sleepy?
Let's just tuck you in there.

844
00:54:05,058 --> 00:54:08,517
Now, give me a kiss. Come on.
Give me a kiss goodbye. Shit!

845
00:54:11,265 --> 00:54:12,631
Oh, my God.

846
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,998
I really hate this rooster.

847
00:54:15,068 --> 00:54:16,263
Merry Christmas.

848
00:54:19,106 --> 00:54:20,438
How's the ankle?

849
00:54:20,774 --> 00:54:21,742
Good.

850
00:54:21,809 --> 00:54:23,801
So, I guess you'll be racing me soon.

851
00:54:24,578 --> 00:54:26,979
I don't think I'll ever really catch up to you.

852
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,673
Court, come on, let's go.

853
00:54:28,982 --> 00:54:29,972
Bye, Monty.

854
00:54:31,652 --> 00:54:32,745
Merry Christmas!

855
00:54:33,253 --> 00:54:34,414
Happy New Year!

856
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:35,887
I'll be right there.

857
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,726
Why don't you come home with me?

858
00:54:42,629 --> 00:54:43,995
See the Big Apple.

859
00:54:44,064 --> 00:54:46,056
Let my four brothers beat you up.

860
00:54:47,234 --> 00:54:49,203
I don't think I'd be good company.

861
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:50,731
I know that.

862
00:54:50,804 --> 00:54:53,831
It's just that the maid has off
for the holidays and...

863
00:54:54,241 --> 00:54:56,870
...we could use someone to do
a little light cleaning.

864
00:54:56,944 --> 00:54:57,843
Nothing big!

865
00:54:57,911 --> 00:55:01,245
Some floor-to-ceiling windows
that should sparkle for the holidays.

866
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:04,112
What about your boyfriend?

867
00:55:05,252 --> 00:55:06,652
Isn't three a crowd?

868
00:55:07,654 --> 00:55:08,747
The Face?

869
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:12,958
He won't be there. I don't bring sex home.

870
00:55:14,328 --> 00:55:15,523
Right, I forgot.

871
00:55:17,364 --> 00:55:20,562
Listen, I'd love to make
your windows sparkle, but...

872
00:55:21,768 --> 00:55:22,929
...I gotta work.

873
00:55:27,307 --> 00:55:28,502
Courtney, come on!

874
00:55:31,512 --> 00:55:34,209
If anything changes,
just give me a call, okay?

875
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:46,757
Merry Christmas!

876
00:56:04,044 --> 00:56:06,240
Hi, Mom. It's me. I'm fine.

877
00:56:08,649 --> 00:56:12,245
I'm really disappointed too.
I've just got too much work to do.

878
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:17,648
It's too expensive.

879
00:56:17,724 --> 00:56:18,851
No, Mom.

880
00:56:20,394 --> 00:56:22,556
I'll call you on Christmas morning, okay?

881
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:29,292
I love you.

882
00:56:41,582 --> 00:56:42,914
Do you love me, Gorky?

883
00:56:47,554 --> 00:56:48,578
Gorky.

884
00:56:49,756 --> 00:56:51,782
Are you and Everett sleeping together?

885
00:56:54,361 --> 00:56:55,351
I thought so.

886
00:56:57,931 --> 00:56:59,456
I'm talking to a chicken.

887
00:58:06,266 --> 00:58:07,461
Are you Harvard?

888
00:58:08,702 --> 00:58:10,534
- That's my blanket.
- It's Simon's.

889
00:58:10,871 --> 00:58:13,500
He gave it to me for keeping this safe.

890
00:58:14,541 --> 00:58:16,533
I'm to give this to you and a message.

891
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:18,579
But first he said you'd give me
something to eat.

892
00:58:18,645 --> 00:58:20,238
Said it shouldn't be roughage.

893
00:58:21,815 --> 00:58:23,181
Come on in.

894
00:58:23,784 --> 00:58:24,979
Have a seat.

895
00:58:26,286 --> 00:58:28,221
I was having a sandwich.

896
00:58:29,523 --> 00:58:30,752
Ham and cheese, okay?

897
00:58:30,824 --> 00:58:31,917
With mustard.

898
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:34,751
So, what's the message?

899
00:58:35,328 --> 00:58:36,523
Don't you want this?

900
00:58:37,631 --> 00:58:39,827
Simon said you think Christ died for this!

901
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:41,726
Just leave it on the table.

902
00:58:42,469 --> 00:58:44,461
So, what's his message?

903
00:58:45,305 --> 00:58:46,295
Here!

904
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:49,910
I gotta get this right.

905
00:58:54,514 --> 00:58:57,143
Now this is Simon Wilder's message here.

906
00:58:59,252 --> 00:59:02,745
''You shall no longer take things
at second or third hand.

907
00:59:03,023 --> 00:59:05,185
''Nor look through the eyes of the dead.

908
00:59:05,559 --> 00:59:07,528
''Nor feed on the specters in books.

909
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:11,732
''You shall not look through my eyes either,
or take things from me.

910
00:59:12,499 --> 00:59:14,400
''You shall listen to all sides...

911
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:16,994
''...and filter them from yourself.''

912
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:20,399
That's it.

913
00:59:21,074 --> 00:59:22,406
I did it perfect.

914
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:26,379
Why didn't he come himself? Is he okay?

915
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,906
He's fine.

916
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:29,616
Where is he?

917
00:59:31,585 --> 00:59:33,178
He doesn't want to see you.

918
00:59:35,756 --> 00:59:37,850
I don't want to bother him but...

919
00:59:38,091 --> 00:59:40,720
...I want to make sure
that he has some place to stay.

920
00:59:40,794 --> 00:59:43,025
As long as you understand,
he doesn't want to see you.

921
00:59:43,096 --> 00:59:45,895
I'm supposed to say
he's at St. Peter's church shelter.

922
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:49,826
Is that a good shelter?

923
00:59:51,872 --> 00:59:53,568
Yeah. It's just great.

924
00:59:59,079 --> 01:00:00,069
Well, good.

925
01:00:01,248 --> 01:00:02,341
Good.

926
01:00:10,257 --> 01:00:12,123
Hello. Where's the men's shelter?

927
01:00:12,225 --> 01:00:13,750
Shelter? Here?

928
01:00:14,528 --> 01:00:15,962
There's no shelter here.

929
01:00:16,096 --> 01:00:19,032
- You sure?
- I've worked here 32 years. I should know.

930
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:22,797
Closest thing to a shelter around here
is over there in the alley.

931
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,096
Thank you.

932
01:00:52,299 --> 01:00:53,631
Leave that alone!

933
01:01:02,843 --> 01:01:05,972
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm taking you to the hospital.

934
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,514
- No, no hospital. No hospitals!
- You're sick.

935
01:01:09,015 --> 01:01:11,177
Listen, you've got to promise me.

936
01:01:12,986 --> 01:01:14,420
No matter what happens...

937
01:01:15,155 --> 01:01:16,248
...no hospitals.

938
01:01:16,323 --> 01:01:17,791
Simon, you're sick!

939
01:01:18,358 --> 01:01:19,382
No lies!

940
01:01:20,894 --> 01:01:21,953
Just promise.

941
01:01:24,197 --> 01:01:25,495
Promise, damn it!!

942
01:01:29,302 --> 01:01:30,634
Okay, I promise.

943
01:01:31,905 --> 01:01:32,895
All right!

944
01:01:50,757 --> 01:01:51,816
You're awake.

945
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:55,421
Breakfast.

946
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:57,689
Eat up!

947
01:01:58,031 --> 01:02:00,125
You are seeing a doctor this afternoon.

948
01:02:01,434 --> 01:02:02,629
Is this your room?

949
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:04,862
No, this is Boz's room. But...

950
01:02:07,007 --> 01:02:08,441
...it's your room now.

951
01:02:08,875 --> 01:02:09,865
Here!

952
01:02:12,512 --> 01:02:13,673
What's this for?

953
01:02:14,347 --> 01:02:15,406
The door.

954
01:02:16,549 --> 01:02:18,484
You can come and go as you please.

955
01:02:18,785 --> 01:02:21,084
No wild parties. I got work to do.

956
01:02:22,088 --> 01:02:23,386
My lungs, Harvard.

957
01:02:24,291 --> 01:02:26,283
But I'll be okay in a couple of days.

958
01:02:26,626 --> 01:02:29,357
Was it smoking. Is that what happened.

959
01:02:29,763 --> 01:02:30,787
Smoking? No.

960
01:02:31,898 --> 01:02:33,059
Asbestos.

961
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:38,999
It was in the shipyards in Baltimore,
and it was on the merchant ship too.

962
01:02:40,707 --> 01:02:43,905
We breathed it when we were
building them and when sailed in them.

963
01:02:44,878 --> 01:02:46,312
And they knew it.

964
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:49,743
They also knew that it would take
20 years to kill you.

965
01:02:54,187 --> 01:02:55,621
That's why you quit.

966
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,385
My lungs quit.

967
01:02:59,092 --> 01:03:00,185
I didn't quit!

968
01:03:01,795 --> 01:03:03,161
I couldn't work.

969
01:03:03,296 --> 01:03:04,491
They fired me.

970
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:12,038
Try and get some rest.

971
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,133
Wait a second.

972
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:19,279
You got your thesis back now,
so what's our deal.

973
01:03:19,779 --> 01:03:21,077
We don't need a deal.

974
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:25,248
We have to have a deal, Harvard.

975
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:27,020
I gotta pay my own way.

976
01:03:27,087 --> 01:03:28,521
How'll you manage that?

977
01:03:30,457 --> 01:03:33,291
Don't you know anything
about government at all, boy.

978
01:03:35,261 --> 01:03:37,560
I'm entitled to disability benefits!

979
01:03:41,701 --> 01:03:45,866
I think it's about time I kissed and made up
with my good old Uncle Sammy.

980
01:03:52,812 --> 01:03:53,973
Thanks, Harvard.

981
01:04:02,789 --> 01:04:05,349
I assume your father told you
about his condition.

982
01:04:05,992 --> 01:04:07,824
He's not my father. He's a friend.

983
01:04:09,229 --> 01:04:10,993
He said asbestos did it to him!

984
01:04:11,064 --> 01:04:12,259
Asbestosis.

985
01:04:12,365 --> 01:04:13,594
That's right.

986
01:04:14,067 --> 01:04:16,366
Mr. Wilder was exposed many years ago.

987
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:20,002
The lungs can't expel the fibers and...

988
01:04:20,473 --> 01:04:22,066
...he's in the final stages.

989
01:04:22,809 --> 01:04:25,108
You mean, it isn't treatable at all.

990
01:04:25,478 --> 01:04:27,413
There's no treatment at any stage.

991
01:04:27,881 --> 01:04:30,077
Basically, the lungs can't take in air.

992
01:04:30,717 --> 01:04:32,845
Often the patient succumbs
to pneumonia...

993
01:04:32,919 --> 01:04:35,514
...or the strain on the heart causes
cardiac arrest.

994
01:04:36,189 --> 01:04:38,181
There's really nothing to do but wait.

995
01:04:39,426 --> 01:04:40,553
I'm sorry.

996
01:05:49,262 --> 01:05:52,198
Harvard! Dinner's served!
Get it down here, boy!

997
01:06:06,846 --> 01:06:08,371
I can't believe it.

998
01:06:08,515 --> 01:06:11,144
What? It's a miracle I can cook. It's easy.

999
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:13,618
All you gotta do is talk a little Frenchy
while you do it.

1000
01:06:13,686 --> 01:06:16,087
I could use a good meal
before I get back to work.

1001
01:06:16,156 --> 01:06:19,752
Back to work. It's New Year's Eve.
Who do you think you are, Dick Clark?

1002
01:06:20,326 --> 01:06:23,922
Besides, didn't I give you back your thesis?
You should be finished by now.

1003
01:06:24,631 --> 01:06:25,894
I'm starting over.

1004
01:06:26,599 --> 01:06:28,568
- You tossed it?
- Yeah, I threw it out.

1005
01:06:28,635 --> 01:06:29,603
The whole thing?

1006
01:06:29,669 --> 01:06:30,762
Yeah, gone.

1007
01:06:30,937 --> 01:06:32,599
Boy, oh, boy. Eat up.

1008
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:35,671
- Want to hear what the new one's on.
- Nope.

1009
01:06:35,808 --> 01:06:38,676
''Behold I do not give lectures
or a little charity.

1010
01:06:38,745 --> 01:06:41,442
''When I give, I give myself.''

1011
01:06:41,881 --> 01:06:43,144
This is great!

1012
01:06:44,284 --> 01:06:45,912
You must be feeling better.

1013
01:06:46,486 --> 01:06:48,011
You went out and shopped.

1014
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:49,988
I didn't go out.

1015
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:52,550
I eat what's handy. It wasn't hard.

1016
01:06:52,992 --> 01:06:54,426
Except for the plucking.

1017
01:06:55,395 --> 01:06:56,363
Plucking?

1018
01:07:03,903 --> 01:07:04,893
Gorky.

1019
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:10,967
Happy New Year, Harvard!

1020
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:25,216
Holy shit!

1021
01:07:26,459 --> 01:07:29,395
You think so? Looks like the regular
garden variety to me.

1022
01:07:31,664 --> 01:07:33,792
Where are you going? Shut the door!

1023
01:07:34,934 --> 01:07:37,233
Big baby? Now he'll probably
tell everybody.

1024
01:07:39,239 --> 01:07:41,674
- He's in the bathroom.
- Hi! When did you get back?

1025
01:07:41,741 --> 01:07:44,643
- What the hell is he doing in there?
- Taking a dump.

1026
01:07:44,711 --> 01:07:47,510
Bingo. That boy didn't go
to Harvard for nothing.

1027
01:07:48,214 --> 01:07:49,546
Honey, I'm home!

1028
01:07:50,083 --> 01:07:51,608
He goes right now!

1029
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:55,948
Peace, children.

1030
01:07:56,022 --> 01:07:57,923
Mr. Wilder, how nice to see you.

1031
01:07:59,292 --> 01:08:00,692
I'm sorry, Jeff, but...

1032
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:01,887
...he's our new Boz.

1033
01:08:01,961 --> 01:08:03,361
That's me, Boz.

1034
01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:05,223
I just flew in from Bali.

1035
01:08:05,865 --> 01:08:09,495
Boz, my long-lost brother!
Where's your tan, man?

1036
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:11,999
We've been through this.

1037
01:08:12,071 --> 01:08:15,974
He gets money from Social Security.
He can pay for rent and food.

1038
01:08:16,142 --> 01:08:17,110
That's right.

1039
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:20,544
I have the full backing and faith
of the United States government.

1040
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:23,407
''God loves Americans''

1041
01:08:23,483 --> 01:08:27,011
You're telling me you want to live
with this guy? This guy's a psychotic.

1042
01:08:28,621 --> 01:08:30,021
Will you stop singing?

1043
01:08:30,556 --> 01:08:33,048
Sing a song every day,
keep your voices high and gay.

1044
01:08:33,126 --> 01:08:35,925
If everybody sings a song,
never will the world go wrong.

1045
01:08:36,162 --> 01:08:38,996
All right, so you can't carry a tune,
but can you cook?

1046
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:41,895
Can I cook?
Does Madonna take her clothes off?

1047
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:44,732
Do Hussein and Ghadaffi pull
each other's taffy?

1048
01:08:44,971 --> 01:08:46,997
Yes! But I don't do windows.

1049
01:08:48,441 --> 01:08:50,239
- You got Fridays.
- I'm in.

1050
01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:52,370
- I will not put up with this!
- Then don't.

1051
01:08:52,445 --> 01:08:56,075
Mr. Wilder will cover your rent.
Get out of my way, Jeff.

1052
01:08:57,684 --> 01:08:59,448
She's right, you big baby.

1053
01:09:00,486 --> 01:09:01,920
I have a complaint.

1054
01:09:02,355 --> 01:09:04,517
Boy, oh, boy. Let me help you with this.

1055
01:09:05,091 --> 01:09:06,923
My van still isn't fixed!

1056
01:09:09,462 --> 01:09:11,431
That's because I ran out of wine.

1057
01:09:14,534 --> 01:09:16,503
Oh, my God, he didn't even flush!

1058
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:27,600
It's the Ides of March.

1059
01:10:27,673 --> 01:10:29,767
And to celebrate, we have a guest.

1060
01:10:30,243 --> 01:10:31,939
Is it Whitman's ghost.

1061
01:10:32,278 --> 01:10:34,679
Is it the slayer of Dragon Pitkannan?

1062
01:10:34,747 --> 01:10:36,079
No, it's...

1063
01:10:36,282 --> 01:10:37,716
The bum of the month!

1064
01:10:39,252 --> 01:10:43,713
You're a widely traveled man, an expert on
how to live comfortably away from home.

1065
01:10:43,890 --> 01:10:46,792
Would you say Harvard is
your favorite spot?

1066
01:10:48,094 --> 01:10:49,585
No way José!

1067
01:10:49,996 --> 01:10:50,986
No.

1068
01:10:52,098 --> 01:10:53,396
What's your favorite spot?

1069
01:10:53,466 --> 01:10:55,492
My favorite place...

1070
01:10:55,568 --> 01:10:58,231
...is a leper colony in Molokai.

1071
01:10:58,638 --> 01:11:00,436
- A leper colony?
- In Molokai.

1072
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:01,808
Why?

1073
01:11:02,842 --> 01:11:05,539
Because I was the most
handsome guy there.

1074
01:11:06,245 --> 01:11:08,441
Jeff, maybe Molokas
where you should go.

1075
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:39,342
Is that French toast?

1076
01:11:39,912 --> 01:11:41,244
I love French toast.

1077
01:11:41,414 --> 01:11:43,212
Even if it's made by my hands?

1078
01:11:43,649 --> 01:11:45,015
Still interested.

1079
01:11:48,454 --> 01:11:49,581
Done just right!

1080
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:51,718
You put your socks in the oven?

1081
01:11:51,791 --> 01:11:54,488
Sure. Two hundred and fifty degrees
for five minutes.

1082
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:56,988
I like my toes toasty warm.

1083
01:11:57,697 --> 01:11:59,427
You sure you don't want some?

1084
01:11:59,499 --> 01:12:00,592
Not now.

1085
01:12:01,534 --> 01:12:04,663
Little squeamish for somebody
who's going to become a doctor.

1086
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:06,403
I'm not squeamish.

1087
01:12:07,874 --> 01:12:10,070
What kind of doctor are you going to be?

1088
01:12:10,510 --> 01:12:12,376
- Gynecologist.
- That's good.

1089
01:12:12,545 --> 01:12:16,038
Only way you'll ever get a young,
sweet thing to drop her drawers for you.

1090
01:12:16,115 --> 01:12:18,175
What are you, the Casanova of Skid Row?

1091
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:21,687
You know why you hate me so much.

1092
01:12:22,121 --> 01:12:23,919
Cause I look the way you feel.

1093
01:12:44,210 --> 01:12:46,736

Why do you think the kids
tease you all the time?

1094
01:12:47,013 --> 01:12:49,073
They're jealous that I'm so handsome.

1095
01:13:02,194 --> 01:13:03,184
Well?

1096
01:13:03,429 --> 01:13:05,295
Pitkannan's going to implode.

1097
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:07,600
Why?

1098
01:13:07,667 --> 01:13:09,898
You're attacking his whole belief system.

1099
01:13:09,969 --> 01:13:11,733
This has none of his pessimism!

1100
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:15,400
''Advances in communication
and technology will eventually allow...

1101
01:13:15,474 --> 01:13:18,501
''...the United States to accomplish
its dream of pure democracy.''

1102
01:13:18,578 --> 01:13:21,548
That's right. Interactive cable's going
to save the world.

1103
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:24,241
All I have to do is prove it.

1104
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:26,881
It's crazy. It's great, I love it.

1105
01:13:27,587 --> 01:13:30,989
The only problem is I don't know
how I'll finish it in four weeks!

1106
01:13:31,057 --> 01:13:33,026
Maybe he'll give you an extension.

1107
01:13:33,559 --> 01:13:37,519
Department policy. If I don't have it
in on time, I don't graduate with honors.

1108
01:13:37,964 --> 01:13:39,023
You can do it.

1109
01:13:40,032 --> 01:13:41,625
You have confidence in me?

1110
01:13:42,768 --> 01:13:43,758
Yes.

1111
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:46,032
No criticism?

1112
01:13:47,306 --> 01:13:48,831
Well, maybe one.

1113
01:13:51,277 --> 01:13:52,370
You're perfect.

1114
01:13:58,050 --> 01:14:00,383
Well, I'd better let you get back to work.

1115
01:14:02,388 --> 01:14:04,584
We don't want you graduating
without honors.

1116
01:14:17,403 --> 01:14:18,598
Goodbye, Gorky.

1117
01:14:18,738 --> 01:14:21,071
Hello, Bessie!

1118
01:14:21,507 --> 01:14:24,739
This is Everett Calloway,
waking you up on a beautiful Sunday.

1119
01:14:25,411 --> 01:14:26,640
New pajamas?

1120
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:28,272
You look great!

1121
01:14:29,048 --> 01:14:30,573
A regular fashion plate.

1122
01:14:33,452 --> 01:14:34,715
Obituaries?

1123
01:14:35,721 --> 01:14:37,246
Studying up to write mine!

1124
01:14:38,491 --> 01:14:40,153
I'm copying you, Harvard.

1125
01:14:40,326 --> 01:14:42,056
Study first and then write.

1126
01:14:43,796 --> 01:14:46,027
Some of these things are really depressing.

1127
01:14:46,699 --> 01:14:49,863
Look at this guy, Barney Milstein.
The one with the three tacks.

1128
01:14:50,469 --> 01:14:51,869
''Barney Milstein...

1129
01:14:51,937 --> 01:14:54,031
''...age 79. Died Saturday.

1130
01:14:54,807 --> 01:14:56,901
''No survivors. No services.''

1131
01:14:58,444 --> 01:14:59,776
How could he die?

1132
01:15:00,346 --> 01:15:01,609
He didn't live!

1133
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,275
I want you to read mine.

1134
01:15:06,352 --> 01:15:08,253
Just what I got so far, anyway.

1135
01:15:09,789 --> 01:15:10,779
Later.

1136
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:16,619
I ain't feeling too good, Harvard.

1137
01:15:18,130 --> 01:15:19,598
I need your opinion now.

1138
01:15:30,376 --> 01:15:33,210
''Simon Wilder!
Born! Portland, Maine, 1942.

1139
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:35,012
''Son of Hank and Anna.

1140
01:15:36,882 --> 01:15:39,750
''Married, 1962 to Lisa Thworston.

1141
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:42,916
''Fathered one son in 1963.

1142
01:15:46,192 --> 01:15:49,594
''Left wife and son in 1963
to join the Merchant Marine.''

1143
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:57,630
That's as far as I got.

1144
01:16:00,339 --> 01:16:01,773
What do you think?

1145
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:10,772
I think that you should put things
in your obituary that you're proud of.

1146
01:16:15,621 --> 01:16:17,920
I thought it was supposed to be facts.

1147
01:16:21,427 --> 01:16:24,022
You had a wife and a son,
and you left them?

1148
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:30,462
And you never came back?

1149
01:16:32,204 --> 01:16:34,673
It's not something I'm proud of, Harvard.

1150
01:16:36,542 --> 01:16:37,840
That's comforting.

1151
01:16:45,818 --> 01:16:48,151
I mean...don't you want to see him?

1152
01:16:50,723 --> 01:16:52,589
Do you think he'd forgive me?

1153
01:16:58,731 --> 01:16:59,960
Eat your breakfast.

1154
01:17:00,733 --> 01:17:03,134
What'd your father do to you
that was so bad?

1155
01:17:04,703 --> 01:17:06,968
What did he do?
He abandoned my mother.

1156
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:09,772
I've got news for you.

1157
01:17:10,609 --> 01:17:14,171
When it comes to relationships,
everybody's a used-car salesman.

1158
01:17:15,181 --> 01:17:16,911
Is that your philosophy?

1159
01:17:17,583 --> 01:17:19,074
Don't trust anyone.

1160
01:17:19,151 --> 01:17:20,881
No, you've got to trust people.

1161
01:17:22,288 --> 01:17:24,280
But you can't believe in the warranty.

1162
01:17:26,292 --> 01:17:27,555
That's cute, Simon.

1163
01:17:27,793 --> 01:17:29,489
Really cute bullshit.

1164
01:17:30,529 --> 01:17:31,622
Harvard.

1165
01:17:34,533 --> 01:17:35,796
You'd be surprised...

1166
01:17:37,136 --> 01:17:40,300
...how different the view is on the way out
than on the way in.

1167
01:17:56,555 --> 01:17:57,989
Can I shut this off?

1168
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:01,757
I have two invites to the Lynx.

1169
01:18:02,962 --> 01:18:06,865
This card will admit you and a guest
to the greatest bash of the year.

1170
01:18:07,366 --> 01:18:09,358
For you and The Face, I presume.

1171
01:18:09,768 --> 01:18:12,169
That means I'll have to make up
with him again.

1172
01:18:13,372 --> 01:18:14,533
Is he upstairs?

1173
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:16,775
Do you have the Lynx? Great!

1174
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:19,707
I'm sorry, I just couldn't worm
another one out of them.

1175
01:18:22,314 --> 01:18:24,215
For you, Lord Montague.

1176
01:18:26,318 --> 01:18:29,049
That's okay, Monty's a monk.
He'll take me as his date.

1177
01:18:29,188 --> 01:18:31,680
Sorry, Jeff. I've already got a date.

1178
01:18:33,425 --> 01:18:34,552
You do?

1179
01:18:36,996 --> 01:18:38,123
I'm taking Simon!

1180
01:18:46,605 --> 01:18:48,073
So, I guess I'll take you.

1181
01:18:48,507 --> 01:18:49,338
Great!

1182
01:18:49,408 --> 01:18:50,432
What about The Face?

1183
01:18:50,509 --> 01:18:52,034
He can fend for himself.

1184
01:18:55,047 --> 01:18:57,107
What are you gonna wear on your date?

1185
01:18:57,182 --> 01:19:01,950
I don't know because my evening gown
hasn't come back from the cleaners yet.

1186
01:19:02,087 --> 01:19:03,749
Honey, hasn't anyone told you?

1187
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:05,484
Lynx is a pajama party!

1188
01:19:16,035 --> 01:19:17,401
Boy, oh, boy!

1189
01:19:17,469 --> 01:19:20,371
Did anybody ever tell you
you look just like Marilyn?

1190
01:19:20,506 --> 01:19:22,031
- Monroe?
- No. Schwartz.

1191
01:19:22,107 --> 01:19:25,566
Her father owns a deli where we get
this knockwurst that's the best.

1192
01:19:25,644 --> 01:19:29,240
- That's a boy who knows how to wear silk.
- He's covering a tragic birthmark.

1193
01:19:29,315 --> 01:19:30,715
Are you Whitman's ghost?

1194
01:19:30,883 --> 01:19:33,580
''You'll hardly know who I am
or what I mean.''

1195
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:36,884
Listen, you shouldn't be with me.

1196
01:19:36,989 --> 01:19:38,651
Why? Am I cramping your style?

1197
01:19:38,724 --> 01:19:40,590
Look at her, she's beautiful.

1198
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:42,760
You have good taste.

1199
01:19:42,895 --> 01:19:44,523
Yeah, you're in love with her.

1200
01:19:48,634 --> 01:19:49,329
So what?

1201
01:19:49,401 --> 01:19:50,596
''So what? ''

1202
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:52,228
- So what?
- ''So what? ''

1203
01:19:52,838 --> 01:19:53,931
It's everything.

1204
01:19:54,006 --> 01:19:55,235
Not to her, it isn't!

1205
01:19:55,307 --> 01:19:56,570
So prove her wrong.

1206
01:19:57,209 --> 01:20:01,374
In four years I haven't been able to get her
to admit she's wrong about anything.

1207
01:20:01,981 --> 01:20:03,745
That proves she loves you.

1208
01:20:03,882 --> 01:20:05,578
What are you waiting for?

1209
01:20:06,251 --> 01:20:08,982
''To drive free, to love free!

1210
01:20:09,154 --> 01:20:11,146
''To court destruction with taunts.

1211
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:14,358
''To feed the remainder of life
with one hour...

1212
01:20:14,827 --> 01:20:16,659
''...of fullness and freedom.

1213
01:20:16,729 --> 01:20:18,129
''One brief hour...

1214
01:20:18,564 --> 01:20:20,294
''...of madness and joy.''

1215
01:20:21,533 --> 01:20:23,001
Would you like to dance?

1216
01:20:24,937 --> 01:20:26,166
Maybe you shouldn't.

1217
01:20:26,705 --> 01:20:29,470
Let's not go overboard
with this staying alive junk.

1218
01:20:29,541 --> 01:20:31,271
Yes, I would. Just a minute!

1219
01:20:32,044 --> 01:20:33,569
Don't let her be a regret.

1220
01:20:33,946 --> 01:20:35,744
It's worse than being a loser.

1221
01:20:36,615 --> 01:20:38,277
- What's your name?
- Marty.

1222
01:20:38,450 --> 01:20:40,316
- What's your major, Marty?
- French.

1223
01:20:40,753 --> 01:20:42,278
Leave me alone!

1224
01:20:42,621 --> 01:20:43,520
Forget it!

1225
01:20:43,589 --> 01:20:45,785
No, I won't forget it. What do you mean?

1226
01:20:51,363 --> 01:20:52,524
Let go of me!

1227
01:20:53,332 --> 01:20:54,356
Jerk!

1228
01:21:24,229 --> 01:21:26,824
- What are you doing?
- I'm ending our friendship.

1229
01:21:53,292 --> 01:21:54,282
Wake up!

1230
01:21:56,495 --> 01:21:57,929
Where're you going?

1231
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:00,257
What's wrong?

1232
01:22:00,566 --> 01:22:01,693
What's wrong?

1233
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:06,968
Do you think there's a hell?

1234
01:22:07,539 --> 01:22:09,303
We've got to get him to the hospital.

1235
01:22:09,374 --> 01:22:10,364
No.

1236
01:22:10,609 --> 01:22:11,975
I promised him!

1237
01:22:13,879 --> 01:22:15,541
I didn't want to be alone.

1238
01:22:20,052 --> 01:22:21,543
I'll go get you some water.

1239
01:22:21,887 --> 01:22:22,877
Thanks.

1240
01:22:27,159 --> 01:22:28,491
Could you....

1241
01:22:29,027 --> 01:22:30,325
Would you...

1242
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:33,726
...sit here for a while.

1243
01:22:40,405 --> 01:22:42,237
Come on, you always bounce back.

1244
01:22:45,377 --> 01:22:47,141
When I was a kid I had a dog.

1245
01:22:48,447 --> 01:22:49,711
Funny-looking thing.

1246
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:51,880
Orange hair, big ears...

1247
01:22:52,584 --> 01:22:53,916
...skinny body.

1248
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:56,421
Used to love to chase cars.

1249
01:22:57,256 --> 01:22:59,157
He got run over three times.

1250
01:23:01,026 --> 01:23:02,824
He never really got hurt.

1251
01:23:03,295 --> 01:23:06,129
He'd go hide under the couch
for a couple of days.

1252
01:23:06,765 --> 01:23:09,826
When he came out he'd go right back
to chasing cars again.

1253
01:23:11,670 --> 01:23:13,536
Eventually he got old and sick.

1254
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:16,274
God, was he ugly.

1255
01:23:18,577 --> 01:23:19,943
Towards the end...

1256
01:23:20,012 --> 01:23:22,675
...he went off into the woods to die alone.

1257
01:23:24,449 --> 01:23:26,975
He laid on a pile of leaves, perfectly still.

1258
01:23:29,288 --> 01:23:30,756
You couldn't move him.

1259
01:23:30,822 --> 01:23:33,189
If you tried to touch him, he'd snap at you.

1260
01:23:34,526 --> 01:23:35,653
Here you go!

1261
01:23:36,562 --> 01:23:37,586
Thanks.

1262
01:23:42,801 --> 01:23:43,791
I'm scared.

1263
01:23:44,736 --> 01:23:45,999
I'm here.

1264
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:49,096
Monty...

1265
01:23:49,341 --> 01:23:50,969
...if I get through tonight...

1266
01:23:51,810 --> 01:23:53,870
...would you drive me someplace
tomorrow.

1267
01:23:56,114 --> 01:23:57,377
Yeah, sure.

1268
01:23:57,449 --> 01:23:58,473
Tomorrow.

1269
01:24:00,018 --> 01:24:01,281
Yeah, tomorrow.

1270
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:02,952
Tomorrow's fine.

1271
01:24:05,390 --> 01:24:06,881
I want to see my son.

1272
01:24:09,027 --> 01:24:10,017
Just once.

1273
01:24:26,511 --> 01:24:28,537

- Did he hand in his thesis?
- I don't know.

1274
01:24:28,614 --> 01:24:30,276
- It's due today.
- He knows.

1275
01:24:34,620 --> 01:24:35,952
Everett, let's go!

1276
01:24:38,890 --> 01:24:41,485
Finished my thesis.
It's not great, but it's done.

1277
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:42,721
Congratulations!

1278
01:24:44,863 --> 01:24:48,027
So, what about yours?
Did you hand it in already?

1279
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:51,193
I'm not done.
I've got to type up a bibliography.

1280
01:24:51,703 --> 01:24:54,537
- How are you going to finish it?
- I guess I won't.

1281
01:24:55,607 --> 01:24:57,542
Did Pitkannan give you an extension?

1282
01:24:58,176 --> 01:24:59,200
No.

1283
01:25:10,322 --> 01:25:11,415
Can I come?

1284
01:25:32,611 --> 01:25:33,772
Turn it around.

1285
01:25:34,513 --> 01:25:35,879
Turn it the other way.

1286
01:25:37,949 --> 01:25:39,110
No, the other way.

1287
01:26:27,966 --> 01:26:29,628
Hello, Mr. Wilder.

1288
01:26:30,669 --> 01:26:33,366
My name's Monty Kessler.
I'm a student at Harvard.

1289
01:26:33,939 --> 01:26:35,407
I guess it was about...

1290
01:26:36,074 --> 01:26:38,066
...three months ago I met your father.

1291
01:26:38,143 --> 01:26:40,237
He's in the van. He wants to see you.

1292
01:26:45,384 --> 01:26:46,682
I don't have a father.

1293
01:26:46,752 --> 01:26:49,187
Please. He's very ill.
He just wants to see you.

1294
01:26:49,254 --> 01:26:50,745
I don't want to see him.

1295
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:52,424
He's dying.

1296
01:26:56,661 --> 01:26:59,631
Please, just walk over
for a couple of minutes. Say hello.

1297
01:26:59,998 --> 01:27:01,364
Let him look at you.

1298
01:27:03,535 --> 01:27:06,095
Then we'll go and you'll never
have to see him again.

1299
01:27:33,432 --> 01:27:35,333
Is there something you want from me?

1300
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,468
I just wanted to look at you.

1301
01:27:43,074 --> 01:27:44,064
Fine!

1302
01:27:44,576 --> 01:27:45,839
Have a look.

1303
01:27:49,714 --> 01:27:50,909
Seen enough?

1304
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:53,511
You look good.

1305
01:27:58,156 --> 01:27:59,522
I'm your father.

1306
01:28:03,495 --> 01:28:05,191
You don't look like much.

1307
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:18,870
I was wrong.

1308
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:22,908
And I'm sorry.

1309
01:28:25,650 --> 01:28:26,948
Yeah, you were wrong.

1310
01:28:29,187 --> 01:28:31,156
I don't care about you being sorry.

1311
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:33,790
I don't care about you.

1312
01:28:34,726 --> 01:28:35,716
Daddy?

1313
01:28:36,228 --> 01:28:37,560
Who is that man?

1314
01:28:39,064 --> 01:28:40,464
It's nobody, baby.

1315
01:28:43,535 --> 01:28:44,525
It's nobody.

1316
01:29:24,943 --> 01:29:26,070
Stop the car!

1317
01:29:26,278 --> 01:29:27,473
Stop the car here!

1318
01:29:28,146 --> 01:29:29,341
Right here, stop!

1319
01:29:36,087 --> 01:29:37,487
He's taking a leak, right.

1320
01:29:42,227 --> 01:29:43,251
The dog....

1321
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:48,895
Get back in the van!

1322
01:29:49,301 --> 01:29:50,428
Get back!

1323
01:30:00,312 --> 01:30:01,780
You're not a dog.

1324
01:31:14,352 --> 01:31:15,877
''I am of old and young

1325
01:31:16,655 --> 01:31:18,817

Oh, God!

1346
01:32:52,517 --> 01:32:54,179
Simon wrote his own obituary...

1347
01:32:54,886 --> 01:32:56,821
...and he asked me to read it.

1348
01:33:00,658 --> 01:33:03,184
''Simon B. Wilder bit it on Wednesday.

Mr. Kessler.

1364
01:34:30,248 --> 01:34:34,948
A thesis advisor, I have always presumed,
is supposed to give advice.

1365
01:34:35,553 --> 01:34:38,113
Especially on the idea of the thesis.

1366
01:34:38,756 --> 01:34:41,021
I'm sorry, sir. I meant you no disrespect.

1367
01:34:41,092 --> 01:34:44,790
But I changed it because I had to write
about something I really believed in.

1368
01:34:44,863 --> 01:34:46,297
Your new idea is...

1369
01:34:46,531 --> 01:34:47,863
Naive is a kind word!

1370
01:34:48,333 --> 01:34:50,666
Foolishly optimistic might be
more the truth.

1371
01:34:52,337 --> 01:34:54,272
Are you withdrawing as my advisor.

1372
01:34:54,739 --> 01:34:57,231
No, I'm not withdrawing my endorsement.

1373
01:34:57,876 --> 01:35:01,369
I don't agree with what your brain
has produced but I...

1374
01:35:02,113 --> 01:35:03,706
...I admire its independence.

1375
01:35:04,883 --> 01:35:07,546
Not many people agree
with my ideas either.

1376
01:35:09,153 --> 01:35:11,782
I do regret that, because of your lateness...

1377
01:35:12,457 --> 01:35:15,450
...you have no chance
to graduate with honors.

1378
01:35:21,499 --> 01:35:23,661
Thank you, sir, for being a true mentor.

1379
01:35:26,037 --> 01:35:27,665
Good luck, Monty.
