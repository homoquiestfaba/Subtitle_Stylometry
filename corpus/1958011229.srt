1
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,820
I know what you're gonna say.

2
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:09,541
Why'd you move the
satellite transponders?

3
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:13,126
Do I need to ask
the question again?

4
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:16,429
It's not that big a deal.

5
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,964
Are you joking?

6
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:19,466
Because even if you
are, it isn't funny.

7
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:21,901
What you did is a federal crime.

8
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:23,403
So gimme a little
help here, Bill.

9
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:25,305
Can you explain to me what
the hell you were doing?

10
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:28,174
Those antennas were pointed
in the wrong direction.

11
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:29,842
Okay, here's a month's
worth of research

12
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,878
on the Artemis Belt,
all right, look.

13
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,180
Now we know those meteors
are headed towards Earth,

14
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:37,517
but up until now, we've been
blindest to when and where.

15
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:38,985
All right, it's all
right here. Just look.

16
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:42,655
Shit, Bill, leaving everything
else aside, which we can't.

17
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:43,856
Are you outta your mind?

18
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:45,224
You know the US
government monitors

19
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,794
those goddamn satellites.

20
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,264
The NSSDs already called me
three times this morning.

21
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:53,866
They're sending
someone out right now,

22
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,167
and you want me to
come at them with,

23
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:58,405
"New Mexico is gonna be
destroyed by a meteor?"

24
00:03:58,406 --> 00:03:59,406
That is the truth.

25
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,509
It's called an impact winter,
if you would just look!

26
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,176
Even if that's
true, don't you think

27
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:07,747
they would be first in line
to know about it, not you?

28
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,850
Not if they're looking
in the wrong direction.

29
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:14,921
Okay, I'm sorry. Look,
maybe this is a good thing.

30
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,789
Is that another joke?

31
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:20,527
Are you a standup comic now?
You suck at being funny.

32
00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:23,430
It's an opportunity
at an audience, okay?

33
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:25,798
Someone at the national level
needs to listen to this.

34
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:28,234
We're talking drastic decreases
in global temperature,

35
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:32,306
mass extinctions upon countless
species, including ours.

36
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:35,508
He's here.

37
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:37,811
Shit, he's here.

38
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:42,616
I haven't had to wear a
fucking tie since 9/11.

39
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:45,318
Hey, I just need
five minutes, please?

40
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:47,053
That's not gonna happen.

41
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:49,121
You're gonna wait inside and
when our conversation ends,

42
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,959
you better hope you're not
taken outta here in handcuffs.

43
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,396
So?

44
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:31,297
Leave your badge with Brenda.

45
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:32,666
Take a long vacation.

46
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,504
I don't understand.

47
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:38,672
You don't understand?

48
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:42,642
I saved your from going to jail.

49
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:47,114
Think of this as early
retirement. Enjoy the mountains.

50
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:50,717
What about my research?
What about Artemis?

51
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:51,884
If we're faced with an impact-

52
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:53,720
- Lower your fucking voice.

53
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:56,956
Impact winter, we're
talking total global freeze.

54
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:58,491
The dust and the
debris from the impact

55
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:00,126
are gonna block out
the sun's radiation.

56
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:01,928
It's gonna make it impossible
heat up the atmosphere.

57
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:03,063
You're still here?

58
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:09,001
Listen, Bill, you ever
heard the expression,

59
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:10,337
"Quit while you're ahead?",

60
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:14,240
do me a favor and
just do what I ask.

61
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:15,543
Ungrateful prick.

62
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,120
God...

63
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:57,016
Has anyone seen Hailey?

64
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:59,085
Hailey, your niece?

65
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,353
I haven't seen her
since the bouquet toss.

66
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,122
I don't want her
to miss the finale.

67
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:05,057
I know where she is.
Last time I saw her,

68
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:07,393
she was in the bathroom
arguing with somebody

69
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:08,395
on her cell phone.

70
00:07:09,697 --> 00:07:12,532
She said something
about a meteor.

71
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:13,600
A meteor?

72
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:14,801
- Yes.
- Seriously?

73
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:15,935
She said something
about a meteor.

74
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,737
Listen, do you not worry?

75
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:20,406
Today is your day. I
will go find Hailey.

76
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:21,407
Thank you.

77
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,244
God, that's weird, huh?

78
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:26,145
Geez.

79
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,789
Dad, you're
being a little bit paranoid.

80
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,125
What's that noise?

81
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:42,228
I told you I'm in Vegas,
at Nicole's wedding.

82
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:43,963
Vegas?
Hailey, listen to me.

83
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,565
In 15 hours a
meter is gonna hit,

84
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:47,067
and you're not safe in Nevada.

85
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,738
Dad, you know?

86
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:53,039
I don't have
time to argue with you.

87
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,306
I'm leaving the office.

88
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,009
Meet me at the cabin
as soon as you can.

89
00:07:58,078 --> 00:07:59,078
Hailey?

90
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,483
Yeah, sure. All right.

91
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,654
I'll be there.

92
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:37,036
Hey.

93
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,045
What? What is it? What happened?

94
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:47,579
You forgot.

95
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,018
I didn't forget.

96
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,586
I just figured with work and
the images we have to analyze

97
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:57,423
that, you know, maybe
we could celebrate

98
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:58,859
the anniversary this weekend?

99
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:06,899
You know what, I'll
get changed right now.

100
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,635
Our anniversary is next month.

101
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,673
I know that.

102
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,113
Hailey, she didn't
get into Stanford.

103
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,683
Oh...

104
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,821
Stanford was a reach anyway, so-

105
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:30,824
- She really wanted this.

106
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,896
She wanted to go to the same
school you graduated from.

107
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:37,898
You know that.

108
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:44,404
God, you didn't even call to
ask if the letter came in.

109
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:49,442
I lost track of time.

110
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:56,115
UNLV, Seton Hall is
still a good choice.

111
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,116
Great backup.

112
00:11:58,118 --> 00:11:59,118
Right...

113
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:05,392
Kel, this Artemis thing
could change my life.

114
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:09,462
Our lives.

115
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,766
If I'm right on this live
Ken's desk by the holidays.

116
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:16,469
Oh my God, she doesn't
care about Ken's desk, Bill.

117
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:20,808
And you know what? As a
matter of fact, neither do I.

118
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:23,710
God, you've been just-

119
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,914
You have spent half of
your daughter's senior year

120
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:30,382
just making empty promises
to the both of us.

121
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:33,653
How long do you expect us to
sit by and just accept it?

122
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:39,059
What are you saying?
You leaving me?

123
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:48,035
I-I don't know.

124
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:55,242
What I do know is that she'll
blame you for the split.

125
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:59,378
You know?

126
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:00,446
And then she'll
resent both of us

127
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,015
for whatever happens after that.

128
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:05,684
I'll make time for this.

129
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:07,187
We're not gonna get a divorce.

130
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,623
Here.

131
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,624
What's that?

132
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,528
Call your daughter.

133
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:19,032
Okay? She needs to know
you still give a shit.

134
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,588
- Dad?
- You're late.

135
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:18,024
Yeah, I called the
office to let you know

136
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:19,691
I was running late.

137
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,428
Ken Hollis said
your phone was off.

138
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:23,695
You called Ken?

139
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,397
Yeah, there's too
much shit going on

140
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:26,866
for your phone to be off.

141
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,802
Here's footage of
White Sands this morning,

142
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:33,039
which is part of
the Chihuahua Desert

143
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,107
and is mostly uninhabited.

144
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:39,211
You can see the catastrophic
devastation of a meteor hit.

145
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:42,614
Again, this is nothing
to be concerned about,

146
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,883
but authorities will
keep us informed

147
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,119
on if anything else
happens this morning.

148
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,588
Just incredible footage
of a meteor striking.

149
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:52,858
They've been playing it
over and over, all morning.

150
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:54,927
I didn't know who else to call.

151
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:55,928
Where was this?

152
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,731
An hour north of White Sands.

153
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:02,935
What's wrong?

154
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,437
White Sands?

155
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,140
Yeah, the Chihuahua
Desert, why?

156
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:10,768
It's exactly where I said
the first impact would hit.

157
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:14,546
Nothing's out there.
No one was injured.

158
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:17,149
Yeah, I know that, Hailey,
but this is just the beginning.

159
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,918
There're gonna be more
meteors and more impacts

160
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,654
and they're gonna be closer to
more densely populated areas.

161
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,890
Well, shouldn't you
get back to the office?

162
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:26,393
Maybe tell someone about this?

163
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:29,728
What did you do?

164
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,132
I got fired.

165
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:34,733
Fired?

166
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:37,569
I did my best to warn
everybody what was gonna happen,

167
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,570
but they let me go.

168
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,408
Three weeks before
tuition is due?

169
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,444
We got more pressing
issues at hand, Hailey.

170
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,645
Like what? Like me not going

171
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,315
to college next
semester, problems?

172
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,519
Like, no one going
to college ever.

173
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:56,223
Okay, well, what
are you gonna do?

174
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,159
I need to warn people.

175
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,128
A lot of people all at once.

176
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:05,097
That final wave hits the mountain
range, we're in deep shit.

177
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:07,133
You can't just put that
kind of thing up on YouTube

178
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:09,736
and expect millions of
people to take you seriously.

179
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:12,838
No, that's a good idea.

180
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:14,106
That's exactly what
we're gonna do.

181
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:16,475
What, dad, no.
It was an asteroid.

182
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:17,976
Meteor.

183
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,445
Okay, fine.

184
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:21,347
It was a small meteor
that landed in the middle

185
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:22,482
of an empty desert.

186
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,217
Don't you think you're making
a mountain out of a molehill?

187
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:27,386
You are not listening to me.

188
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:28,820
I need to tell people
to evacuate the city.

189
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,822
If I'm right,
Albuquerque is next,

190
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,125
followed by the mountains.

191
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:35,127
Okay, well do
what you need to do,

192
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:36,762
but you're gonna have to
find somewhere else to go

193
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:39,065
all ballistic
doomsday this weekend.

194
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:41,867
What, why? What's
wrong with here?

195
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:42,902
You don't remember?

196
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:45,504
Lucas came up here
with me this weekend

197
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,805
before he leaves for Aspen.

198
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:50,176
Lucas. You had to make a stop?

199
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:51,610
He's in the car.

200
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:54,213
And before you say I
never told you about this,

201
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:56,148
I can show you
the text messages.

202
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,149
But Lucas?

203
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:00,018
That's my name,
don't wear it out.

204
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,254
Lucas, what a
pleasant surprise.

205
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:03,955
Be nice.

206
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:06,058
Why don't you put the bags
in the guest room for us?

207
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,526
You got it, babe.

208
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,329
Oh, and Mr. Z, Hailey told
me all about your job.

209
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:13,466
Man, awesome. I would hate
to lose something like that.

210
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:18,438
Like I said, I can show
you the text messages.

211
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,241
All right.

212
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:24,510
I have to go, but I'll be back.

213
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:25,711
All right, do me a favor,

214
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,479
promise me you'll
stay put? Stay inside.

215
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,615
Lucas can go out if
he wants to though.

216
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:33,152
What, why him?

217
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,353
Because I think he's a loser

218
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:36,188
and I don't care
what happens to him.

219
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:37,189
I'll be back.

220
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:58,944
It doesn't
matter. You have to-

221
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:01,480
Then you gotta put it in order.

222
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,582
Hope it's not an important
phone call? Hang it up, Ken.

223
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,016
Hold on, just a second.

224
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,319
Mr. Zito, I told you
that you cannot be in here.

225
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,554
Now don't you believe me?

226
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:09,489
What do you think's
gonna happen next?

227
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:10,457
Do you want people to die, Ken?

228
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,690
I'll call-I'll call you back.

229
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:13,058
What the hell are
you doing here?

230
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,226
I'm gonna call the police.

231
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:15,294
Do you want me to call

232
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:16,028
the police?
No, thank you Brenda.

233
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:17,197
It'll be fine.

234
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:22,468
You know I can have
you thrown in jail

235
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:23,602
just for calling up here.

236
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,971
You have to leave like, now.

237
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:27,273
12 Hours from now, Ken.

238
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:29,675
Two more strikes,
one in Albuquerque,

239
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:31,109
the one after that
in the snow caps.

240
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,078
I don't need to tell
you what kind of damage

241
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,312
that's gonna do.

242
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:34,633
What do you want
me to do, Bill?

243
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:37,216
Evacuate the city.

244
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:39,718
Evacuate the
city? Are you nuts?

245
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,687
I don't have the
authority to do that.

246
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:43,121
You worked here for six years,

247
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,757
don't tell me you already
forgotten how we paid the rent.

248
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,393
Your name is gonna be
all over the headlines

249
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:48,894
as the guy who had
this information

250
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:50,128
and turned a blind eye to it.

251
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,498
Information? This shit
is far from confirmed.

252
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:53,999
My data is accurate.

253
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,960
Will you just listen to
what I'm telling you, Ken?

254
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:59,104
Your son, your son,
he's a sophomore

255
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:00,872
up in Carrington, right?

256
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,574
What's your point?

257
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:05,444
And be real fuckin'
careful what you say next.

258
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:06,446
Evacuate the city.

259
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:09,782
Ken, evacuate the city.

260
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:13,653
I'm wasting my fucking time.

261
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,292
Son of a bitch.

262
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,046
Good morning.

263
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,515
You didn't come
back last night.

264
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:17,516
I did.

265
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:22,220
It was late. Didn't
wanna wake you.

266
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,824
Well, did you get
anyone's attention?

267
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:26,925
Not really.

268
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,296
Well, maybe you're
wrong about this one.

269
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:31,297
Fingers crossed.

270
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:36,336
You're really worried
about this, aren't you?

271
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,938
I tracked Artemis
for six years.

272
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:43,342
Where's Lucas?

273
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:03,996
Oh, there it is.

274
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:05,398
Go.

275
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:06,398
Go!

276
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:15,240
What you're looking at

277
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:16,842
are the first
images coming into-

278
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:18,577
- Isn't that your building?

279
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:21,314
- In apparent meteor-
- Holy shit.

280
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:25,917
Sir.

281
00:21:27,587 --> 00:21:28,655
You need to see this.

282
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:32,724
Early reports say authorities
are urging individuals

283
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:35,461
within a 90 mile radius
of the city of Albuquerque

284
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:39,097
to stay indoors and be
with their families.

285
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:41,633
Stay tuned for more
breaking news as it comes.

286
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,903
We'll be here detailing the
media attack on Albuquerque,

287
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:47,473
New Mexico.
Should I call someone?

288
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:48,474
Get me Zito.

289
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,242
Now.

290
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,713
The number
could be catastrophic.

291
00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:57,949
Fuck.

292
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:04,724
Yeah, I'm watching
it right now.

293
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,994
Yeah, I can be there in
two hours. I'm on my way.

294
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:10,061
What's going on?

295
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,697
Lab has been destroyed.

296
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:14,566
Artemis is getting closer,
I gotta go into town.

297
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:17,035
Right now? It doesn't look
safe to head into the city.

298
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:19,805
I don't have time to argue
with you about this, okay?

299
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:24,009
The next round of impacts,
they're gonna be much worse.

300
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,777
Well, you can't just
leave me here alone.

301
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:27,012
Well, you have Lucas.

302
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:28,781
Goddamn it, Where'd
you say he was?

303
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:31,483
Lucas!

304
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:33,985
Lucas!

305
00:22:37,424 --> 00:22:39,090
Lucas!

306
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:40,091
Lucas!

307
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:47,298
Shit.

308
00:22:48,134 --> 00:22:49,134
What's wrong?

309
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,270
Phone isn't working.

310
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:53,271
Something's up.

311
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:57,175
Go back to the house, check
it out. See if he's there.

312
00:22:57,176 --> 00:22:58,177
Lucas!

313
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:00,413
The hell are you dip shit?

314
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:15,193
Lucas!

315
00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:28,474
Lucas!

316
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:37,182
Anything?

317
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:38,918
Found phone lines
are out at the house.

318
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:42,821
No sign of Lucas?

319
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:46,959
Nothing, dad. What
are we gonna do?

320
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:53,131
How important is
this kid to you?

321
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:55,201
Dad... I love him.

322
00:24:01,841 --> 00:24:03,676
Let me get my rifle.

323
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,254
Ah.

324
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:00,031
Ah!

325
00:25:16,816 --> 00:25:18,149
Fuck!

326
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,150
Shit!

327
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:38,671
Shit!

328
00:25:54,654 --> 00:25:55,654
Lucas!

329
00:25:58,591 --> 00:25:59,591
Lucas!

330
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:04,730
He's only been
gone a couple hours.

331
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:07,332
He couldn't have
gotten too far on foot.

332
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,768
Especially if he has no
idea where he is going.

333
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:13,705
I'm thinking we're gonna
patrol here or here.

334
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:15,206
Either one's a hike, so
we need to get moving.

335
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:16,875
We're running outta time.

336
00:26:16,876 --> 00:26:19,244
Running outta
time before what?

337
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:23,649
Artemis, more strikes.
Won't be safe out in the open.

338
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,784
And my predictions are correct,
the animals in this area

339
00:26:25,785 --> 00:26:27,385
are gonna get very
confused and very angry.

340
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:28,955
So Lucas isn't safe either way.

341
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:33,892
I got about eight hours
till the real fun starts.

342
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:35,293
So we stick together
and find him

343
00:26:35,294 --> 00:26:36,695
as quickly as possible, yes?

344
00:26:36,696 --> 00:26:38,129
No wondering off.

345
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,564
All right, as time goes by,

346
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:40,532
we won't have any idea
what's happening out there.

347
00:26:40,533 --> 00:26:41,834
So stay close, understood?

348
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:44,637
Say it loud so I
know you hear me.

349
00:26:45,805 --> 00:26:47,339
Yes, I understand.

350
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:51,042
We stick together at all times.

351
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:52,644
All right, good.

352
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:54,313
All right, let's go.

353
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:11,162
Lucas!

354
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:16,234
Lucas!

355
00:27:25,712 --> 00:27:30,717
Lucas!

356
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:03,549
Lucas!

357
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:18,898
Fuck!

358
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:13,512
Shit.

359
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:13,071
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

360
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:14,840
Is it-Is it Lucas?

361
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,477
It's a wolf.

362
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:20,712
It's close by.

363
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:24,450
We need to find
your boy. Come on.

364
00:31:26,018 --> 00:31:27,018
Come on.

365
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:01,552
Lucas!

366
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:06,557
Lucas!

367
00:32:16,502 --> 00:32:17,502
What is it?

368
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:22,007
It's been an
hour since we left.

369
00:32:22,008 --> 00:32:24,109
That sun's gonna go down soon.

370
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,110
So?

371
00:32:26,345 --> 00:32:29,281
Well kiddo, I know you're
infatuated with this kid, but...

372
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:31,250
At some point-

373
00:32:31,251 --> 00:32:32,884
- That's not happening.

374
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,820
It won't be safe for us
once that sun goes down,

375
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:37,222
do you understand
what I'm saying?

376
00:32:37,223 --> 00:32:38,956
So what, We just
leave Lucas here to die

377
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,458
because you're too
chicken shit to be outside

378
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:41,393
when it gets dark?

379
00:32:41,394 --> 00:32:43,228
That's not what I meant.

380
00:32:43,229 --> 00:32:44,395
He could be lost.

381
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:45,396
He could be dead.

382
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:51,303
What do you see in
this kid, anyway?

383
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:53,405
He's kind to me.

384
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:57,608
All the doctor's
appointments, all the therapy,

385
00:32:57,609 --> 00:33:00,646
and Lucas was a cure all
along, who would've thought?

386
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:03,648
Mom liked him.

387
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:07,419
She said he made her think of
you when you two first met.

388
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:12,858
He met your mother?

389
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,795
Thanksgiving, a
week before she left.

390
00:33:18,197 --> 00:33:19,197
Really?

391
00:34:09,615 --> 00:34:10,715
Help me!

392
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:11,716
Please!

393
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,796
No stopping.

394
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:26,797
Okay.

395
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:30,468
You're mad.

396
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:32,871
You always clam up when
you get mad. What is it?

397
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:36,474
We can't go on walking
in silence like this.

398
00:34:36,475 --> 00:34:39,009
So whatever you
have to say, say it!

399
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,245
Go on.

400
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:41,312
You took him to
see your mother.

401
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:42,313
Here we go.

402
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:44,315
That's something you
do when you're engaged.

403
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:45,816
You're not engaged, are you?

404
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:48,719
No, but what if I was?
That isn't your decision.

405
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,190
And just so you know,
mom was fine with it.

406
00:34:52,358 --> 00:34:53,791
She thought he was
a perfect gentleman.

407
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:54,992
Don't.

408
00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:57,595
So, whatever problems
you have with Lucas,

409
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,864
get over it, Dad, it's my life.

410
00:34:59,865 --> 00:35:00,965
I'm trying to save your life.

411
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:02,200
You couldn't save mom's life

412
00:35:02,201 --> 00:35:03,935
and I don't need
you to save mine.

413
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:12,043
Is that what you
think happened?

414
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:16,047
I just let her go, that
I allowed that to happen.

415
00:35:17,683 --> 00:35:19,851
Well, if you do, I feel
very sorry for you.

416
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:25,457
I wasn't there, so I couldn't
bring myself to see it.

417
00:35:28,427 --> 00:35:30,128
Thought it'd be
less real Somehow.

418
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:33,599
We all know I was wrong.

419
00:35:35,701 --> 00:35:36,701
And I'm sorry, kid.

420
00:35:38,404 --> 00:35:40,705
Trust me, It's gonna haunt
me a lot longer than you.

421
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:41,640
Look-

422
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:43,841
- No, you look, I'm going back.

423
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:45,276
I know Lucas is
important to you,

424
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:48,213
but millions of people are
gonna die if I don't help them.

425
00:35:48,214 --> 00:35:50,348
Now, I'm not expecting
you to understand that,

426
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:51,650
but I'm asking you to try.

427
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:53,985
Now enough, let's go.

428
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:56,754
Enough!

429
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:01,792
Lucas?

430
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:06,331
Lucas?

431
00:36:07,933 --> 00:36:08,933
Lucas.

432
00:36:13,038 --> 00:36:14,038
Lucas!

433
00:36:15,073 --> 00:36:16,074
Is that you?

434
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,010
Lucas!

435
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:38,909
Hailey!

436
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,880
Lucas!

437
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:18,717
And he just looks at me
with that oily Russian smile.

438
00:40:19,818 --> 00:40:21,687
Makes me wanna punch the wall.

439
00:40:22,888 --> 00:40:26,891
Oh, and Ken, Ken is
absolutely useless.

440
00:40:26,892 --> 00:40:27,826
You know, he might
as well come out

441
00:40:27,827 --> 00:40:28,927
and say he's on his side.

442
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:34,733
The fact of the matter is
that research isn't his.

443
00:40:36,334 --> 00:40:39,904
You can't own facts, you know?

444
00:40:39,905 --> 00:40:42,039
You can't put a monopoly
on the solar system

445
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,709
and what's happening
inside of it.

446
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,110
Unbelievable.

447
00:40:48,514 --> 00:40:49,681
Are you listening to me?

448
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:53,151
Hailey went to see
a movie with Lucas.

449
00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:56,687
Okay?

450
00:40:56,688 --> 00:40:57,888
Did you hear what I said about
this asshole in the office?

451
00:40:57,889 --> 00:41:00,024
Unbelievable.
Yes, I, I heard you,

452
00:41:00,025 --> 00:41:01,792
but you really need
to just stop talking

453
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,529
and listen to what
I have to say.

454
00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:13,438
I asked Hailey to leave
for the night because...

455
00:41:17,676 --> 00:41:21,178
The test came back in
from the doctor's office.

456
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:25,516
And well, I went down
there this afternoon.

457
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:29,119
I left you message, I guess
Brenda didn't tell you about it?

458
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,990
No, of course, Brenda didn't
tell me about it. What is it?

459
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:36,027
The tumor has metastasized.

460
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:39,597
Metastasized.

461
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:43,267
The cancer has spread to
another part of my body.

462
00:41:43,268 --> 00:41:45,604
I know what it means,
babe. Which part?

463
00:41:48,073 --> 00:41:50,842
My brain.

464
00:41:58,784 --> 00:41:59,784
Can they operate?

465
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,920
No.

466
00:42:07,726 --> 00:42:10,261
The hospital administrator
called an hour ago.

467
00:42:11,663 --> 00:42:14,498
They can try to remove
the lump from my thyroid,

468
00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:18,770
but it isn't covered by
our medical insurance.

469
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:21,706
No, that's a mistake.

470
00:42:21,707 --> 00:42:23,941
We have major medical.
You're fully covered.

471
00:42:23,942 --> 00:42:26,176
I called the
insurance company.

472
00:42:26,177 --> 00:42:28,412
They don't consider
an elective procedure-

473
00:42:28,413 --> 00:42:30,715
- This isn't a facelift
we're talking about.

474
00:42:30,716 --> 00:42:32,650
All right, it's a county
hospital, they can't refuse care.

475
00:42:32,651 --> 00:42:33,918
I don't wanna argue with you.

476
00:42:33,919 --> 00:42:36,087
I'm just telling
you what they said.

477
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:46,196
If they won't cover the
bill, what options do we have?

478
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:47,197
Cash.

479
00:42:49,868 --> 00:42:50,868
How much?

480
00:42:52,871 --> 00:42:53,871
Kel, how much?

481
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:58,209
$300,000.

482
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:01,713
Oh, Jesus Christ.

483
00:43:03,348 --> 00:43:05,850
You know the only
other option is we can-

484
00:43:05,851 --> 00:43:08,786
We can just transfer
my files to regional.

485
00:43:08,787 --> 00:43:10,354
No, absolutely not.

486
00:43:10,355 --> 00:43:12,122
Your doctor's a top
oncologist in the state.

487
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:13,724
We're not gonna lose
him to save money.

488
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:15,192
Okay, then what do we do?

489
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:18,128
Okay, Hailey starts
school in six weeks.

490
00:43:18,129 --> 00:43:20,397
She can go to
community college.

491
00:43:20,398 --> 00:43:22,232
I can't ask her to do that.

492
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:23,801
Why not?

493
00:43:23,802 --> 00:43:25,235
You know how many
teachers with degrees

494
00:43:25,236 --> 00:43:27,071
are working at Walmart, by
choice, because it pays better?

495
00:43:27,072 --> 00:43:27,973
She'll understand.

496
00:43:27,974 --> 00:43:29,740
She won't understand.

497
00:43:29,741 --> 00:43:31,509
Then she'll
fucking learn to try.

498
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:43,822
You know, there's one
other thing to consider,

499
00:43:46,224 --> 00:43:47,425
that we do nothing.

500
00:43:49,928 --> 00:43:53,430
You know, just make
me as comfortable

501
00:43:53,431 --> 00:43:55,734
here at home as we can.

502
00:43:57,068 --> 00:43:58,970
I think they called
it quality of life.

503
00:44:03,709 --> 00:44:08,612
The doctor thinks
that since my brain

504
00:44:08,613 --> 00:44:13,018
is considerably beyond the
point of corrective surgery,

505
00:44:14,419 --> 00:44:19,257
that we should, we
should start thinking of-

506
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:30,001
We should start-Start thinking
of ways to say goodbye.

507
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:34,505
You know, maybe take a trip.

508
00:44:36,074 --> 00:44:37,508
Make it a happy time.

509
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:44,716
You're not gonna
die, all right?

510
00:44:47,085 --> 00:44:48,085
I'll fix this.

511
00:44:50,956 --> 00:44:52,357
I don't want to say goodbye.

512
00:44:53,658 --> 00:44:54,658
Okay?

513
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:58,696
I won't take no for an answer.

514
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:19,917
Hailey, wake up.

515
00:45:19,918 --> 00:45:20,918
Hailey!

516
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:22,920
Dad?

517
00:45:23,855 --> 00:45:25,155
What's going on?

518
00:45:25,156 --> 00:45:27,592
Can you move your
arms, hands, anything?

519
00:45:30,796 --> 00:45:31,796
I'm stuck.

520
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,501
If we can rock our
weight back and forth,

521
00:45:37,502 --> 00:45:39,971
I think we can scoot over
that counter, can you see it?

522
00:45:41,539 --> 00:45:42,539
Are you hurt?

523
00:45:43,641 --> 00:45:44,641
I'm fine.

524
00:45:46,544 --> 00:45:47,544
I'm bleeding.

525
00:45:49,781 --> 00:45:50,781
Me too.

526
00:45:51,983 --> 00:45:53,417
Who did this?

527
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:54,819
I don't know.

528
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,887
Just do as I say, okay?

529
00:45:56,888 --> 00:45:58,055
Okay, ready?

530
00:45:58,056 --> 00:46:00,657
Just wanna rock on three.

531
00:46:00,658 --> 00:46:02,159
One,

532
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,228
two...

533
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:13,371
Do you know why I am here?

534
00:46:17,475 --> 00:46:18,877
Interesting research.

535
00:46:23,081 --> 00:46:24,549
Just tell me what you want.

536
00:46:30,088 --> 00:46:31,456
You know what I want?

537
00:46:34,392 --> 00:46:36,962
You really don't remember
who I am, do you?

538
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:40,197
Liar.

539
00:46:40,198 --> 00:46:41,099
Dad.

540
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,200
Quiet Hailey.

541
00:46:43,168 --> 00:46:48,173
Huh.

542
00:46:49,774 --> 00:46:50,774
Hailey.

543
00:46:54,512 --> 00:46:56,314
You know I had a daughter once.

544
00:46:58,483 --> 00:47:01,352
She was not much younger
than you when she was killed.

545
00:47:04,522 --> 00:47:07,591
Did you know in my country
you would be considered

546
00:47:07,592 --> 00:47:09,259
old enough to marry?

547
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,795
Tell me what you want!

548
00:47:12,263 --> 00:47:13,264
Talk to me!

549
00:47:16,601 --> 00:47:18,102
Artemis.

550
00:47:18,103 --> 00:47:19,470
That's what it was, yes?

551
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,740
The news was showing the
initial onslaught, yes?

552
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:25,409
Yes. Artemis was-

553
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:28,112
- I know what Artemis is.

554
00:47:28,113 --> 00:47:32,582
And not because I just read
six years of your research

555
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:35,220
while you were tied
to fucking a chair.

556
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:40,158
I know you.

557
00:47:41,659 --> 00:47:44,161
I knew what Artemis
was even before you came

558
00:47:44,162 --> 00:47:45,230
to work at the CSR.

559
00:47:46,497 --> 00:47:48,533
Dad, what the hell
is he talking about?

560
00:47:51,236 --> 00:47:53,703
Your father must be getting
older or have lost his memory

561
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,373
at such a young age.

562
00:47:56,474 --> 00:47:57,942
You know this guy?

563
00:47:57,943 --> 00:48:00,678
Do you want to tell the
girl or would you like me to?

564
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:04,781
Yeah, I know him.

565
00:48:04,782 --> 00:48:08,319
He's just a former
disgruntled employee.

566
00:48:10,255 --> 00:48:11,421
Yeah?

567
00:48:11,422 --> 00:48:13,358
Yeah, you heard me.

568
00:48:16,161 --> 00:48:17,894
Disgruntled!

569
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:21,131
You stole my life's
work, you ruined me.

570
00:48:21,132 --> 00:48:24,001
Dad, what's going
on? You're scaring me.

571
00:48:24,002 --> 00:48:25,936
Don't listen to him.
He's full of shit.

572
00:48:25,937 --> 00:48:27,137
Always has been.

573
00:48:27,138 --> 00:48:29,906
Your father. You
say thief and a liar.

574
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:32,609
He's stole my life's
research on Artemis

575
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:34,711
and pissed it off as his own.

576
00:48:34,712 --> 00:48:35,946
He's lying!

577
00:48:35,947 --> 00:48:38,482
Call me a fucking liar again

578
00:48:38,483 --> 00:48:41,518
and I'll peel the
flesh from her face!

579
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:42,353
- All right!
- Dad!

580
00:48:42,353 --> 00:48:43,288
All right!

581
00:48:43,289 --> 00:48:45,990
Let her got, we talk! We talk!

582
00:48:45,991 --> 00:48:47,158
Tell me what you want!

583
00:48:50,095 --> 00:48:53,630
I want what you stole
from me, I want what's mine!

584
00:48:53,631 --> 00:48:54,898
Jesus.

585
00:48:54,899 --> 00:48:58,102
Jesus has nothing
to do with this.

586
00:48:58,103 --> 00:49:01,538
Don't you think it's a
little late for all that? Huh?

587
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:03,407
Millions of people
are gonna die.

588
00:49:03,408 --> 00:49:04,774
We are gonna die!

589
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,510
Then we will all
die knowing that I

590
00:49:06,511 --> 00:49:09,614
am the man who discovered
Artemis, not you.

591
00:49:11,316 --> 00:49:12,816
How?

592
00:49:12,817 --> 00:49:15,620
There is a telecommunication
station two hours from here.

593
00:49:17,122 --> 00:49:18,589
We make the call from there.

594
00:49:19,657 --> 00:49:20,657
No power.

595
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,795
The station runs off
of gasoline generators.

596
00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:28,766
We leave soon before
the sun goes down.

597
00:49:30,368 --> 00:49:32,636
And you know this
how, you've been there?

598
00:49:32,637 --> 00:49:34,972
You're lack of faith
in me is insulting.

599
00:49:36,341 --> 00:49:37,775
And what if I refuse, huh?

600
00:49:39,444 --> 00:49:41,578
What if I say fuck it,
we're all gonna die, anyway.

601
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:43,314
Why give you the satisfaction?

602
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,417
Because if you refuse...

603
00:49:48,786 --> 00:49:50,055
I will kill Lucas.

604
00:49:51,022 --> 00:49:52,022
No.

605
00:49:52,957 --> 00:49:53,957
No!

606
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,200
Hey!

607
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,669
Keep fucking moving.

608
00:50:40,838 --> 00:50:41,838
Go.

609
00:51:04,762 --> 00:51:06,264
Is he even still alive?

610
00:51:08,833 --> 00:51:09,999
That depends.

611
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,235
On what?

612
00:51:11,236 --> 00:51:13,170
Don't waste your time.

613
00:51:13,171 --> 00:51:15,305
The man's a psychopath,
look what he's done.

614
00:51:15,306 --> 00:51:17,807
It depends on how often
you insist on stopping

615
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:19,209
to ask if he's still alive.

616
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:20,611
I have a right to know.

617
00:51:23,248 --> 00:51:25,149
He's alive for now.

618
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:26,550
The more time we waste,

619
00:51:26,551 --> 00:51:28,751
the less I can guarantee
you'll still find him that way.

620
00:51:30,155 --> 00:51:31,922
Hailey, Hailey!

621
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:07,857
No stopping.

622
00:52:08,826 --> 00:52:10,261
We need a break.
We need water.

623
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:36,320
Keep moving.

624
00:52:36,321 --> 00:52:37,687
I said we need a break.

625
00:52:37,688 --> 00:52:38,688
30 Minutes.

626
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:41,392
You heard her, half an hour.

627
00:52:44,695 --> 00:52:46,630
He's your friend, what
you do with the time

628
00:52:46,631 --> 00:52:47,898
he has left is up to you.

629
00:52:53,571 --> 00:52:55,138
Does it hurt?

630
00:52:55,139 --> 00:52:56,140
No, I'm alright.

631
00:52:57,575 --> 00:52:59,344
Do you think he's
telling the truth?

632
00:53:01,412 --> 00:53:02,813
You don't understand, kid.

633
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,515
I was trying to make
a name for myself

634
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:06,784
when your mother got ill.

635
00:53:12,423 --> 00:53:17,428
We didn't have any money
for medical, hospital bills.

636
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:22,500
I was scared and I fucked up.

637
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,909
I just have to live with that.

638
00:53:33,344 --> 00:53:35,980
And I have lived with it so
I could watch you grow up.

639
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:40,417
I always thought I could save-

640
00:53:40,418 --> 00:53:43,120
- Dad, you were always
trying to save the world.

641
00:53:44,522 --> 00:53:47,124
I always thought I could
try save your mother.

642
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:52,829
What about Lucas?

643
00:53:54,299 --> 00:53:55,299
Oh, kid.

644
00:53:57,935 --> 00:53:58,935
Pretty far out.

645
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,772
We don't find him soon,
it doesn't look good.

646
00:54:08,045 --> 00:54:11,416
I understand why
you did what you did.

647
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:15,885
I love Lucas and if
there's any chance

648
00:54:15,886 --> 00:54:18,489
that he's still alive
and breathing out here,

649
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,059
I'm gonna do whatever
it takes to save him.

650
00:54:24,695 --> 00:54:25,695
All right.

651
00:54:36,307 --> 00:54:38,007
Keep moving!

652
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:40,276
No more breaks, your
friend's life depends on it.

653
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:41,277
Go! Go!

654
00:54:51,922 --> 00:54:54,024
No more fucking
breaks, keep moving.

655
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:01,865
Dad!

656
00:55:01,866 --> 00:55:03,299
Oh.

657
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,734
Go!

658
00:55:04,735 --> 00:55:05,735
Move, go!

659
00:55:28,292 --> 00:55:29,292
Stop.

660
00:55:32,096 --> 00:55:33,197
I need to take a leak.

661
00:55:38,536 --> 00:55:40,670
Think we can get
that gun away from him?

662
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:41,871
Why would we do that?

663
00:55:41,872 --> 00:55:43,740
I thought we were gonna
make the call first.

664
00:55:43,741 --> 00:55:44,941
Yeah, what if
we make the call,

665
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:45,876
and he doesn't tell
us where he is?

666
00:55:45,877 --> 00:55:47,877
There's two of us, one of him.

667
00:55:47,878 --> 00:55:52,215
I don't know, if we try
and we don't get the gun

668
00:55:52,216 --> 00:55:56,019
and he kills one of us,
then we don't get to Lucas,

669
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:58,788
and this was all for nothing.

670
00:55:58,789 --> 00:56:00,123
Yeah, but the call
will be pointless

671
00:56:00,124 --> 00:56:02,659
if there's no one on the
other end to answer it.

672
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:03,660
You understand?

673
00:56:05,062 --> 00:56:06,062
Stop.

674
00:56:06,831 --> 00:56:07,831
What is now?

675
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:13,169
I hear you whispering.
Planning something.

676
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:14,237
Is that a question?

677
00:56:14,238 --> 00:56:16,473
Don't fucking fuck with me.

678
00:56:16,474 --> 00:56:18,575
We were just
talking about Lucas.

679
00:56:18,576 --> 00:56:20,109
What about him?

680
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:22,111
We need some
assurance he's alive.

681
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:25,214
We make the call, I
give you the coordinates.

682
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,850
How far away is he
from the com building?

683
00:56:26,851 --> 00:56:28,952
No more questions, move!

684
00:56:28,953 --> 00:56:30,620
No, bullshit.

685
00:56:30,621 --> 00:56:32,756
I need you to be
straight with us here.

686
00:56:32,757 --> 00:56:33,757
You want straight?

687
00:56:34,792 --> 00:56:36,860
I only need you for this.

688
00:56:36,861 --> 00:56:39,028
You wouldn't do that.

689
00:56:39,029 --> 00:56:41,031
Won't I? Try me mother-

690
00:56:44,034 --> 00:56:45,269
- Ah!

691
00:56:55,279 --> 00:56:56,447
Get the gun!

692
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:02,151
Shoot him!

693
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,661
Get the fuck over there!

694
00:57:11,662 --> 00:57:13,430
Get over there, move!

695
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,852
Lennox.

696
00:57:35,853 --> 00:57:38,087
Please! Just tell
us where it is.

697
00:57:38,088 --> 00:57:39,689
Tell is the coordinates,
just tell us the coordinates.

698
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:41,991
Tell me, where's the boy?

699
00:57:41,992 --> 00:57:42,960
Please.

700
00:57:42,961 --> 00:57:45,830
You win.

701
00:57:47,532 --> 00:57:48,633
No, no, no.

702
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:52,001
Lennox!

703
00:57:52,002 --> 00:57:53,002
Lennox.

704
00:58:11,522 --> 00:58:14,859
I'm sorry.

705
00:58:20,631 --> 00:58:21,966
We need to go.

706
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:24,433
Dad.

707
00:58:26,604 --> 00:58:28,305
We need to keep going.

708
00:58:55,232 --> 00:58:56,232
What's wrong?

709
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:01,170
Frank called.

710
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,742
Trust papers will be
here in the morning.

711
00:59:05,743 --> 00:59:06,777
Like we discussed.

712
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:14,183
You'll need to sign.

713
00:59:14,184 --> 00:59:15,184
You up to it?

714
00:59:16,453 --> 00:59:18,288
Well, it still works.

715
00:59:21,792 --> 00:59:23,993
There's a conference
in Santa Fe.

716
00:59:23,994 --> 00:59:25,562
I told Ken to go on without me.

717
00:59:27,598 --> 00:59:28,733
You should go.

718
00:59:30,868 --> 00:59:33,036
I'll make it
through the weekend.

719
00:59:33,037 --> 00:59:36,774
I know that, but
it's done, I'm staying.

720
00:59:37,975 --> 00:59:42,980
No, you don't have to
be to okay with this.

721
00:59:48,018 --> 00:59:49,486
I'll never be okay with this.

722
00:59:51,756 --> 00:59:52,756
I know.

723
00:59:59,897 --> 01:00:01,766
Hey, can I ask you a question?

724
01:00:04,401 --> 01:00:06,836
This thing with the
Russian at work.

725
01:00:06,837 --> 01:00:07,837
What about it?

726
01:00:13,343 --> 01:00:14,644
You already know this,

727
01:00:14,645 --> 01:00:19,382
but if your actions in
this life don't live up

728
01:00:19,383 --> 01:00:23,954
to who you are, then you
really haven't done anything.

729
01:00:33,998 --> 01:00:38,567
You know that thinking
you're doing the right thing

730
01:00:38,568 --> 01:00:42,873
and actually doing it
are two different things?

731
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:47,277
You need rest.

732
01:00:49,914 --> 01:00:52,648
You can't marry
again, you know?

733
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,284
I'll haunt your
dreams if you do.

734
01:00:58,388 --> 01:00:59,589
I believe it.

735
01:02:28,612 --> 01:02:29,780
You all right?

736
01:02:31,315 --> 01:02:33,317
Did you mean what
you said back there?

737
01:02:35,452 --> 01:02:37,254
You said that we
were all gonna die.

738
01:02:38,856 --> 01:02:40,223
- Hailey.
- Don't do that.

739
01:02:40,224 --> 01:02:42,859
Don't waltz around me
like I'm 10 years old.

740
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:45,629
Just answer the question.

741
01:02:47,664 --> 01:02:49,266
No one survives impact winner.

742
01:02:50,334 --> 01:02:51,334
No one.

743
01:02:52,302 --> 01:02:54,604
Then what's the
point? Lucas is dead.

744
01:02:55,472 --> 01:02:56,473
We don't know that.

745
01:02:57,707 --> 01:02:59,809
Let's go to the con
building, radio out,

746
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:01,044
see if there's any
help out there.

747
01:03:01,045 --> 01:03:02,578
Anybody can help
just look for him.

748
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:03,746
But what if it's
like you said,

749
01:03:03,747 --> 01:03:05,382
what if no one's
there to answer?

750
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,484
I'm trying my best to stay
on top of the situation.

751
01:03:08,485 --> 01:03:11,788
All right, we're almost there
sweetheart, let's keep moving.

752
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:19,863
I only blamed you
because I needed to believe

753
01:03:19,864 --> 01:03:24,869
that someone killed her and
not some stupid disease.

754
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:32,408
It was wrong for me to hold
you responsible for that.

755
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:33,409
I'm so sorry.

756
01:03:35,445 --> 01:03:37,347
I know you loved her
as much as I did.

757
01:03:40,184 --> 01:03:41,184
Okay.

758
01:03:42,987 --> 01:03:45,422
Let's keep moving, all right.

759
01:04:35,505 --> 01:04:36,505
Hold on.

760
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:49,085
This is it, isn't it?

761
01:04:49,086 --> 01:04:52,256
We need to run,
come on. Go, go, go!

762
01:06:05,495 --> 01:06:07,031
What is this place?

763
01:06:08,665 --> 01:06:10,599
It's an old weather center.

764
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:11,768
There's nothing here.

765
01:06:13,837 --> 01:06:15,571
There's gotta be a radio.

766
01:06:15,572 --> 01:06:16,572
Find something.

767
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:23,312
I found it.

768
01:06:27,584 --> 01:06:29,086
Somebody please come in.

769
01:06:34,591 --> 01:06:35,992
Is there anybody there?

770
01:06:38,562 --> 01:06:40,430
Is there anybody
reading me, over?

771
01:06:42,899 --> 01:06:43,899
You're right.

772
01:06:44,701 --> 01:06:45,735
There's nothing here.

773
01:06:47,204 --> 01:06:48,438
No, I don't understand.

774
01:06:49,806 --> 01:06:50,906
I'm waiting.

775
01:06:50,907 --> 01:06:52,242
I don't understand.

776
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:55,545
It's a goddamn
fallout shelter.

777
01:06:56,646 --> 01:06:57,947
Why did he lead us here?

778
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:04,954
What's funny? Why
did he lead us here?

779
01:07:06,056 --> 01:07:07,223
You win.

780
01:07:07,224 --> 01:07:08,224
You win?

781
01:07:09,493 --> 01:07:12,296
As he laid there dying,
he whispered, "You win."

782
01:07:14,131 --> 01:07:16,632
"You win," what
does that even mean?

783
01:07:16,633 --> 01:07:18,267
He knew this was the only
place you could survive

784
01:07:18,268 --> 01:07:19,603
what's happening out there.

785
01:07:21,071 --> 01:07:22,839
He was gonna ride
it out down here.

786
01:07:24,141 --> 01:07:25,675
We beat him to it.

787
01:07:31,748 --> 01:07:33,483
Stay right behind me.

788
01:07:46,663 --> 01:07:47,663
Stay close.

789
01:08:12,322 --> 01:08:15,759
What do you think's
going on out there?

790
01:08:17,327 --> 01:08:18,728
God only knows.

791
01:08:25,269 --> 01:08:26,669
Oh, Hey!

792
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:27,770
Oh!

793
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:28,772
No, no, no, it's me.

794
01:08:30,874 --> 01:08:32,908
You're alive! Oh, my god,

795
01:08:32,909 --> 01:08:34,877
I knew you were alive-
oh! Yeah, ah, yeah.

796
01:08:34,878 --> 01:08:36,112
Oh my god, your leg.

797
01:08:38,515 --> 01:08:40,149
What happened?

798
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:41,617
It's nothing.

799
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:44,721
I tripped, but the Russian
guy, he patched me up.

800
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:47,790
Hey, Mr. Z.

801
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:48,791
Bitching gun.

802
01:08:49,993 --> 01:08:51,994
The Russian?

803
01:08:51,995 --> 01:08:53,262
Croatian, Russian,
I don't know.

804
01:08:53,263 --> 01:08:55,364
That part of the world
just bleeds together.

805
01:08:55,365 --> 01:08:56,532
How'd you get in here?

806
01:08:56,533 --> 01:08:58,066
Lennox brought me here.

807
01:08:58,067 --> 01:08:59,835
After he patched me up, he
said he was going downhill

808
01:08:59,836 --> 01:09:01,404
to look for you.

809
01:09:01,405 --> 01:09:03,172
Strange guy, if you ask me.

810
01:09:03,173 --> 01:09:05,040
Really cool accent though.

811
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:06,842
Any idea if we can
use any of this stuff?

812
01:09:06,843 --> 01:09:08,344
I got only a little
bit of it working

813
01:09:08,345 --> 01:09:10,145
off what little
battery power we have.

814
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:11,447
The radio is a little spotty,

815
01:09:11,448 --> 01:09:13,582
but the PC can run morse
code if we need it to.

816
01:09:13,583 --> 01:09:14,484
Morse code?

817
01:09:14,485 --> 01:09:15,584
In DOS, yeah.

818
01:09:15,585 --> 01:09:17,052
You know Morse code?

819
01:09:17,053 --> 01:09:18,954
Yeah. Eagle Scouts.

820
01:09:18,955 --> 01:09:20,956
Lucas, you're just
full of surprises.

821
01:09:20,957 --> 01:09:22,625
My guess is no one
answered back, huh?

822
01:09:22,626 --> 01:09:25,728
Nothing yet, but I found
a freezer full of food.

823
01:09:25,729 --> 01:09:26,696
We can wait it out.

824
01:09:26,697 --> 01:09:28,231
Food and water?

825
01:09:28,232 --> 01:09:31,834
For at least six months,
yeah. There's three of us.

826
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:33,702
I'll tell you what, Lucas,

827
01:09:33,703 --> 01:09:34,937
let's get something to eat first

828
01:09:34,938 --> 01:09:37,139
and then we'll start
on these messages.

829
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:38,541
Wait, wait, wait.

830
01:09:38,542 --> 01:09:39,708
To who?

831
01:09:39,709 --> 01:09:40,910
Anybody who'll listen.

832
01:09:44,248 --> 01:09:45,614
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

833
01:09:45,615 --> 01:09:48,183
How'd you end up logging
into the mainframe?

834
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,052
Oh, easy, I just
figured out the cipher.

835
01:09:50,053 --> 01:09:51,588
Cipher, how?

836
01:09:53,223 --> 01:09:54,758
Easy.

837
01:09:58,828 --> 01:10:00,195
Okay.

838
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:01,664
A monoalphabetic sub-cipher maps

839
01:10:01,665 --> 01:10:04,032
individual letters
to plain text, right?

840
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:06,001
So everything's on
a one to one basis.

841
01:10:06,002 --> 01:10:07,870
As in, every instance
of plain text,

842
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:09,772
there's a matching
cipher letter for it.

843
01:10:09,773 --> 01:10:11,073
Kid stuff.

844
01:10:11,074 --> 01:10:12,341
Okay.

845
01:10:12,342 --> 01:10:14,310
So see this plain
text here and here?

846
01:10:14,311 --> 01:10:15,978
All I had to do to
encipher the firewall

847
01:10:15,979 --> 01:10:17,547
was just to create a shift map.

848
01:10:18,882 --> 01:10:20,749
Enter it as a password.

849
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:21,585
I'm in.

850
01:10:21,586 --> 01:10:23,018
Jesus, Lucas, English.

851
01:10:23,019 --> 01:10:24,152
Sorry. Okay.

852
01:10:24,153 --> 01:10:25,854
I took every instance
of plain text,

853
01:10:25,855 --> 01:10:28,223
matched it to a cipher letter
from a table I created.

854
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,426
Like I said, candy from a baby.

855
01:10:30,427 --> 01:10:31,694
How'd you know how to do that?

856
01:10:31,695 --> 01:10:33,396
Oh, the internet.

857
01:10:33,397 --> 01:10:34,630
Oh, you read about
it on the internet?

858
01:10:34,631 --> 01:10:35,931
Yeah, yeah. I mean,
it's really interesting.

859
01:10:35,932 --> 01:10:37,165
Makes sense.

860
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:39,368
First cipher was for
what, Julius Caesar?

861
01:10:39,369 --> 01:10:40,569
It was just simple
shift mapping,

862
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:43,272
but it was still
complex for its time.

863
01:10:43,273 --> 01:10:45,674
Okay, so what's the password?

864
01:10:45,675 --> 01:10:46,675
It's a weird one.

865
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:50,279
Zephyr.

866
01:10:51,281 --> 01:10:52,715
Zephyr.

867
01:10:52,716 --> 01:10:53,716
Zephyr.

868
01:10:55,819 --> 01:10:59,187
Like the skateboard. We went
to the warp tour that one time.

869
01:10:59,188 --> 01:11:02,225
Lucas, I may have seriously
underestimated you, I'm sorry.

870
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:06,796
I'm sorry too, about the
whole end of the world thing...

871
01:11:08,532 --> 01:11:10,499
And your job...

872
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,500
College.

873
01:11:12,902 --> 01:11:17,807
But, none of that matters
now because, well...

874
01:11:25,515 --> 01:11:28,116
Artemis sent
Earth into an impact winner

875
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:29,353
just as Lennox predicted.

876
01:11:31,855 --> 01:11:34,089
And just seven hours after
the tops of the mountains

877
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:37,326
were struck, the surface
temperature fell 30 degrees,

878
01:11:37,327 --> 01:11:39,195
never returning
above freezing again.

879
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:43,031
We were never supposed
to prevent Artemis

880
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:44,401
from destroying our planet.

881
01:11:45,569 --> 01:11:46,970
We were only meant
to survive it.

882
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:03,773
Testing. Testing.

883
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:09,945
Okay.

884
01:14:11,748 --> 01:14:12,748
News?

885
01:14:14,584 --> 01:14:18,354
No. Small blips on the
radar, nothing to brag about.

886
01:14:20,490 --> 01:14:21,790
Transmissions?

887
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:22,859
Same as yesterday.

888
01:14:24,594 --> 01:14:25,962
You see anything out there?

889
01:14:27,363 --> 01:14:28,797
I took about
halfway down the base

890
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:31,366
and sun's starting
to peek through.

891
01:14:31,367 --> 01:14:33,369
A couple more weeks,
we could get lucky.

892
01:14:36,005 --> 01:14:37,073
Food's running low.

893
01:14:38,241 --> 01:14:39,742
There's enough for three.

894
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:40,743
Four.

895
01:14:45,549 --> 01:14:47,382
Thought you were checking
the tower antennas.

896
01:14:47,383 --> 01:14:50,419
I was, but Lucas
insisted he do it.

897
01:14:51,454 --> 01:14:52,855
Really?

898
01:14:52,856 --> 01:14:55,691
It's a lot of stress
climbing up that far.

899
01:14:55,692 --> 01:14:56,692
Stress?

900
01:14:58,795 --> 01:15:00,063
What the hell is going on?

901
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:03,967
Either one of you can answer me.

902
01:15:06,269 --> 01:15:07,570
- I'm pregnant.
- I'm pregnant.

903
01:15:07,571 --> 01:15:09,938
Sorry. No, she's
pregnant, not me.

904
01:15:09,939 --> 01:15:12,708
I'm the one that did the
impregnating and fun-

905
01:15:12,709 --> 01:15:13,610
- Oh, I got that.

906
01:15:13,611 --> 01:15:15,443
- Sorry...
- Thanks Lucas.

907
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:16,980
Well, what do you think?

908
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:20,115
You're gonna be a grandpa?

909
01:15:20,116 --> 01:15:22,651
I don't know why
that sounds so strange.

910
01:15:22,652 --> 01:15:24,987
Man, we thought you'd be mad.

911
01:15:24,988 --> 01:15:26,421
Put her there dad.

912
01:15:26,422 --> 01:15:27,623
Too soon.

913
01:15:27,624 --> 01:15:29,091
Yeah. Yeah. It's
too-My fault.

914
01:15:29,092 --> 01:15:30,193
Lucas, please.

915
01:15:31,394 --> 01:15:33,996
My only concern is
medical supplies.

916
01:15:33,997 --> 01:15:36,566
What if you go into
labor? I am not trained.

917
01:15:41,237 --> 01:15:44,272
Santa Fe Command, does anyone copy?

918
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:45,942
Santa Fe, coming in.
