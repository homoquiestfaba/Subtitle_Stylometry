00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:12,064
Hey, Aishe.
Where's my beautiful bride?

7
00:01:12,098 --> 00:01:14,542
Tell her I want my dance.
Come on, Nikola!

00:01:19,105 --> 00:01:20,672
- Whoo whoo.

What are you doing?

00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:05,450
Aishe.

13
00:02:06,986 --> 00:02:07,954
Aishe!

Hana?

Aishe...

21
00:03:09,015 --> 00:03:10,750
- Don't touch me, Tamas.
- [squelch]

22

Hana, I curse
your family to die...

Hana, I curse
your family to die...

30
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:40,083

[soft tense music]

35
00:03:58,064 --> 00:03:59,098
What have you done?

36
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:01,033
I heard her.

37
00:04:01,968 --> 00:04:03,635
Was Aishe casting
the Abolishment Curse?

38
00:04:04,636 --> 00:04:06,138
Did she say the final words?

39
00:04:10,943 --> 00:04:13,946
- [shouts] Did Aishe finish it?
- No, I don't know.

40
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,949
Well, she will when her spirit
leaves her body and rises.

[sinister music]

42
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:21,954
[Hana tearful] Naida,
she's dead.

43
00:04:31,197 --> 00:04:32,198
What are you doing?

44
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,267
We have to sever
the hand that killed her.

45
00:04:35,301 --> 00:04:37,169
[Hana] Naida, what?

46
00:04:37,203 --> 00:04:38,838
The hand that takes the life
holds the life. You know this.

47
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:40,239
If we bury your hand
with her body

48
00:04:40,272 --> 00:04:41,706
we'll hold her spirit
down forever.

49
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:43,675
You don't know it'll work.

50
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,812
For the sake of my unborn child
you'd better hope it does.

51
00:04:46,846 --> 00:04:47,947
[Hana cries] Not my hand, Naida.

00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,547
[mouthing]

53
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,583
- Please.
- [cries]

54
00:04:51,616 --> 00:04:53,585
- It's the only way.
- [Hana cries] No...

- [squelching thud]
- [solemn music]

56
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,838
[Naida] Your hand
can never be removed, ever.

57
00:05:12,872 --> 00:05:15,875
Or her spirit will rise
and she will finish the curse.

58
00:05:17,675 --> 00:05:18,610
[Hana] I know.

59
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:22,014
[Naida] Promise me
you won't let anybody,

60
00:05:22,048 --> 00:05:23,883
I mean, anybody on our land.

61
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:26,118
We can't risk anyone
finding the grave.

62
00:05:27,053 --> 00:05:28,254
Promise me, Hana.

63
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:31,891
[Hana] I promise.

64
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:36,661

00:05:38,097 --> 00:05:39,065

[applause]

68
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:51,167
May this new generation
light the way for our people!

69
00:09:27,326 --> 00:09:28,227
- For loyalty.
- For loyalty.

70
00:09:42,074 --> 00:09:45,577
- [applause]
- [cheering]

00:09:52,151 --> 00:09:54,486
[soft tranquil music]

72
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:03,829
Oh, shoot...

73
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,068
Nikola, will you help?

74
00:10:13,205 --> 00:10:14,106
Thank you.

75
00:10:19,378 --> 00:10:21,280
[Zara] I'll never
wear one of these.

76
00:10:23,115 --> 00:10:25,617
The day the man has to wear one,
I might reconsider.

77
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:29,021
- Beautiful.
- [Petar] Come.

78
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:32,224
That's so sweet.

79
00:10:32,925 --> 00:10:33,892
Aw...

80
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,928
- [soft chuckle]
- I'm so proud.

81
00:10:35,961 --> 00:10:36,862
[sniffs]

82
00:10:37,363 --> 00:10:38,230
Drink up.

83
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,266
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

84
00:10:42,234 --> 00:10:45,270
Really, aunt Hana, we're not
in the old country anymore.

85
00:10:45,304 --> 00:10:47,306
Why is it that only women
have to wear

86
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:49,441
big old sold signs
once they get married?

87
00:10:50,476 --> 00:10:53,078
Would you try to look for
the beauty in our traditions,

88
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:54,179
not the fault.

89
00:10:55,147 --> 00:10:56,615
[Petar] I couldn't agree
with you more, Mom.

90
00:10:57,817 --> 00:10:59,952
Well, if they're so great,
how come you never wear yours?

91
00:11:01,553 --> 00:11:02,588
[soft grunt]

92
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:04,223
- Dani.
- [Dani] Ha, ha...

93
00:11:05,224 --> 00:11:07,626
Hi, I'm Petar's cousin.

94
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,963
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hey...

95
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,332
If we knew the way
to get invited back

96
00:11:13,365 --> 00:11:18,137
to this old place was
to marry your sorry ass, well...

97
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,638
I'd do that.

98
00:11:19,671 --> 00:11:21,039
[Hana] Jeez, Matej.

99
00:11:21,273 --> 00:11:23,242
Okay, and now
go get some coffee.

100
00:11:23,575 --> 00:11:24,476
Go.

101
00:11:26,512 --> 00:11:29,248
Yeah, that's my brother.
But he's right,

102
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:31,984
we would have settled
even for a funeral.

103
00:11:32,017 --> 00:11:33,952
Mm. Still charming
as ever, I see.

104
00:11:34,553 --> 00:11:36,588
Your funeral
may be the only time

105
00:11:36,622 --> 00:11:38,457
we do get invited back,

106
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,492
since you probably
won't get married, right?

107
00:11:41,193 --> 00:11:42,094
Ah...

108
00:11:45,197 --> 00:11:46,298
[spits]

109
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:48,333
[Zara] Mom!

110
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:55,207
Uh... Spitting...

111
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,543
is a way of ensuring
good luck or success

112
00:11:57,576 --> 00:11:58,444
for our people.

113
00:11:59,611 --> 00:12:01,313
Yeah,
she just wants to make sure

114
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,382
you're going to be a good wife
to my cousin here.

115
00:12:03,415 --> 00:12:05,384
[soft sinister music]

116
00:12:12,224 --> 00:12:13,258
Having second thoughts?

117
00:12:14,493 --> 00:12:17,362
If I knew what I was getting
into I wouldn't have proposed.

118
00:12:17,396 --> 00:12:19,665
What?
Way to wear the pants, girl.

119
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:21,567
[chuckle]

120
00:12:22,668 --> 00:12:24,670
So, she proposed to you?

121
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,408
I like your dress.

122
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:30,342
[soft chuckle]

123
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:39,651
You can lose the coin.

124
00:12:39,685 --> 00:12:41,754
The wedding is over.
They're leaving tonight.

125
00:12:41,788 --> 00:12:43,121
Okay, Naida?

126
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,250
Think the rumors are true?

127
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,875
Where there's odor,
there's a pile of...

128
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,125
Jelka! Watch it!

129
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:54,292
Must be a reason they hid
themselves all these years.

130
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,000
Why come out now, then?

131
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,542
And now the son
marries an American!

132
00:13:00,042 --> 00:13:02,333
This place has some bad energy.

133
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:03,708
Yeah, it's bad.

134
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,181
Hey.

135
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,387
I know we're still
on everyone's lips,

136
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,589
but that doesn't mean
that they know what's going on.

137
00:13:17,623 --> 00:13:18,624
Naida...

138
00:13:27,332 --> 00:13:30,435
[melodic guitar music]

139
00:13:37,142 --> 00:13:39,478
Music's the one thing
that has always been able

140
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:41,547
to connect us
to the rest of the world.

141
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:46,285
[distant melodic singing]

142
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:47,917
Come on, Nikola.

143
00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:56,796
[sings]

144
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:11,209
[sharp yell]

145
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:20,218
Whoo!

146
00:14:24,891 --> 00:14:26,291
Where is Zara's father?

147
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,228
He left before Zara was born.

148
00:14:32,865 --> 00:14:35,100
[Sunny] Looks like your
aunt Naida never got over it.

149
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:41,139
No. Her and mom probably
just got into another fight.

150
00:14:41,473 --> 00:14:43,275
Seriously,
I've never seen two sisters

151
00:14:43,308 --> 00:14:44,276
always so at odds.

152
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:45,277
[soft chuckle]

153
00:14:56,622 --> 00:14:59,759
- [cheering]
- [applause]

154
00:15:04,864 --> 00:15:07,332
[soft sinister music]

155
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:09,668
You sure don't want
any visitors do you?

156
00:15:11,236 --> 00:15:12,504
You know what that is?

157
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:17,010
No, no, I mean...

158
00:15:18,677 --> 00:15:21,914
Those thorns could intimidate...
the toughest of criminals.

159
00:15:21,948 --> 00:15:22,681
[soft chuckle]

160
00:15:24,516 --> 00:15:26,886
It's um...
It's called firethorn.

161
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:30,689
Something that's protected
my family for centuries.

162
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,558
After a sacrifice is offered,
we're the only ones

163
00:15:33,592 --> 00:15:34,727
who can pass through unharmed.

164
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:38,630
You know...

165
00:15:39,665 --> 00:15:41,801
if you get tangled in it...
you can't get out.

166
00:15:42,668 --> 00:15:46,271
Those thorns...
lock themselves into place.

167
00:15:46,705 --> 00:15:49,341
They say the pain...
is excruciating.

168
00:15:52,711 --> 00:15:54,881
So, why don't you
dig them up then?

169
00:15:56,314 --> 00:15:58,550
Our people are superstitious
about shovels.

170
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:01,353
We believe working with them
will eventually lead to death.

171
00:16:01,988 --> 00:16:03,321
Speaking of...

172
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,959
You sure you want this
for your life?

173
00:16:07,526 --> 00:16:10,495
[nervous chuckle] Of course,
I want to.

174
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:14,466
Yeah, you say that now,
but if you would know...

175
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:15,968
Just how happy we were

176
00:16:16,002 --> 00:16:17,970
by becoming part
of our family, right?

177
00:16:18,871 --> 00:16:20,505
- Yay, family.
- [chuckles]

178
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,775
- Okay, let's go, sweetheart.
- Yeah.

179
00:16:22,809 --> 00:16:25,343
Okay? Family. Woohoo!

180
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,678
[whispers] I'm so sorry.

181
00:16:27,412 --> 00:16:28,447
[soft chuckle]

182
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,315
[approaching footsteps]

183
00:16:32,684 --> 00:16:34,453
[Naida] Hana,
do <i>mama i tata</i> know

184
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:36,354
that their grandson
was getting married?

185
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:45,664
There's no occasion in the world

186
00:16:45,697 --> 00:16:47,632
that can take away the pain
and the shame I brought them.

187
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,368
That must be
why Nikola doesn't have

188
00:16:50,402 --> 00:16:52,437
any pictures of his family.

189
00:16:52,872 --> 00:16:55,742
- Don't!
- Because why be reminded...

190
00:16:55,775 --> 00:16:58,811
every day...
of what you can't go back to.

191
00:17:00,813 --> 00:17:03,482
In a world that's already
ostracized us all,

192
00:17:03,515 --> 00:17:04,516
and now his own family.

193
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:05,885
Naida.

194
00:17:05,918 --> 00:17:07,586
He's even denied children
of his own,

195
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,021
because he's too frightened
that your curse...

196
00:17:09,055 --> 00:17:10,255
[Hana] What do you want from me?

197
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,792
[Naida] After all
that Nikola sacrificed,

198
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:15,427
and yet you still allowed
this ridiculous wedding

199
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,495
to take place here.

200
00:17:16,528 --> 00:17:18,898
We all made sacrifices.

201
00:17:19,564 --> 00:17:20,933
Why did you even come?

202
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:23,002
Because you made me a promise.

203
00:17:23,035 --> 00:17:26,338
That you'd never let any family,
anybody, onto this land.

204
00:17:28,107 --> 00:17:30,777
- I know my promise.
- And then you broke it...

205
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,913
And now, once again
because of your selfishness

206
00:17:33,946 --> 00:17:36,414
I have to stay here
and protect us all.

207
00:17:41,954 --> 00:17:45,423
My son has never asked
for anything...

208
00:17:46,491 --> 00:17:47,492
but this.

209
00:17:48,393 --> 00:17:50,328
It would break my heart
if he couldn't get

210
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:51,964
proper blessings
from the family.

211
00:17:55,101 --> 00:17:56,769
[tense music]

212
00:17:57,469 --> 00:18:00,372
We are still paying
for the last time

213
00:18:00,405 --> 00:18:02,975
you let your heart
cloud your mind.

214
00:18:16,655 --> 00:18:17,556
[sniffs]

215
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,875
I'm so sorry, mom and dad.

216
00:18:34,774 --> 00:18:35,674
[sniffs]

217
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,958
Steer everyone away
from Aishe's grave.

218
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,083
Steer everyone away
from Aishe's grave.

219
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,792
Steer everyone away
from Aishe's grave.

220
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,167
Steer everyone away
from Aishe's grave.

221
00:19:02,068 --> 00:19:03,368
[sighs]

222
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:09,667
Purify bad intentions
of all who enter.

223
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,154
How about a drink?

224
00:19:22,755 --> 00:19:23,856
[Petar] Hmm. Okay.

225
00:19:30,162 --> 00:19:33,065
[indistinct chatter]

226
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:39,071
[solemn music]

227
00:19:42,674 --> 00:19:43,708
[tense music]

228
00:19:45,878 --> 00:19:46,913
[crackling]

229
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:01,861
[music intensifies]

230
00:20:01,894 --> 00:20:03,461
[crackling continues]

231
00:20:06,899 --> 00:20:07,800
Do you?

232
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:10,036
Where are you going?
Stay with us.

233
00:20:10,069 --> 00:20:11,804
Yeah? What?

234
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,808
[soft groan]

235
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:20,445
[breathes heavily]

236
00:20:23,015 --> 00:20:24,917
[indistinct chatter]

237
00:20:27,253 --> 00:20:28,854
My wife needs me.

238
00:20:36,262 --> 00:20:37,495
[Sunny] Petar.

239
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:39,899
[glass shatters]

240
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,125
I am family, let me pass.

241
00:20:47,974 --> 00:20:50,042
[Sunny] It's moving
on its own, Petar.

242
00:20:52,845 --> 00:20:54,213
- [Sunny sobs]
- [crackling stops]

243
00:20:56,015 --> 00:20:59,185
[sighs] I am so sorry, baby.

244
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:01,553
I'm going to get my mom, okay?
Stay here, okay?

245
00:21:03,923 --> 00:21:05,758
[tense music]

246
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:07,159
[crackling resumes]

247
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,583
I am family, let me pass.

248
00:21:16,969 --> 00:21:18,738
[crackling fades]

249
00:21:23,042 --> 00:21:24,110
Why would you go in there?

250
00:21:24,709 --> 00:21:25,610
Mom!

251
00:21:25,945 --> 00:21:27,313
I, I didn't. I just...

252
00:21:27,346 --> 00:21:29,215
I just, I got too close
to the edge.

253
00:21:30,016 --> 00:21:32,785
Oh. The herbs will help
with the pain, okay?

254
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:33,986
Thank you..

255
00:21:37,023 --> 00:21:38,891
[soft sinister music]

256
00:21:44,696 --> 00:21:45,597
[sucks teeth]

257
00:21:46,165 --> 00:21:47,066
Okay?

258
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:13,591
I'll hold you, okay.

259
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,328
You need to lie down, okay?
I'll take you inside.

260
00:22:16,996 --> 00:22:18,197
Just... careful.

261
00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:28,207
Stop. I'll put some herbs
under her bed, Naida.

262
00:22:35,147 --> 00:22:38,683
[Dani] Petar! Get out here
and sing something with Dani.

263
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:40,920
[Petar replies indistinctly]

264
00:22:42,888 --> 00:22:44,256
[door squeaks open]

265
00:22:51,696 --> 00:22:55,167
- [distant singing]
- [water running]

266
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:08,667
Water from our land to purify.

267
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:13,833
Roots from our land to heal.

268
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:22,958
Shells to strengthen
and protect.

269
00:23:34,273 --> 00:23:35,174
Whoo!

270
00:23:39,979 --> 00:23:42,381
[sings]

271
00:23:57,163 --> 00:23:59,198
[approaching footsteps]

272
00:24:14,313 --> 00:24:16,115
[soft sinister music]

273
00:24:20,219 --> 00:24:21,921
I came to see
how you're feeling.

274
00:24:24,223 --> 00:24:26,125
I'm, I'm feeling
a little better.

275
00:24:26,158 --> 00:24:28,794
[Petar, muffled]
I gotta go check on my bride.

276
00:24:28,827 --> 00:24:31,696
I'll let you rest up so you
can get going on your honeymoon.

277
00:24:35,501 --> 00:24:38,871
[receding footsteps]

278
00:24:49,315 --> 00:24:51,350
[clock ticks softly]

279
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:59,225
[solemn music]

280
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:01,792
To keep in memory.

281
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,708
During your darkest of times,

282
00:25:06,792 --> 00:25:08,792
this memory
can act as your light.

283
00:25:14,206 --> 00:25:15,140
[soft knock]

284
00:25:15,507 --> 00:25:16,842
- [door opens]
- [softly] Hey.

285
00:25:19,011 --> 00:25:20,713
[Petar] I remember that day
so clearly.

286
00:25:22,281 --> 00:25:24,850
How is it even possible?
What was I, like four?

287
00:25:26,585 --> 00:25:27,786
You were three.

288
00:25:29,054 --> 00:25:29,955
[soft chuckle]

289
00:25:32,524 --> 00:25:34,426
It is so good to have you back.

290
00:25:36,862 --> 00:25:38,364
How's your thesis going?

291
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,103
It's going.

292
00:25:45,271 --> 00:25:46,438
It's just, um...

293
00:25:47,673 --> 00:25:50,142
It's taken me a while to find
my place in the world, Mom.

294
00:25:52,945 --> 00:25:54,580
You know I home schooled you
to protect you.

295
00:25:54,613 --> 00:25:56,915
- Mom, people were saying about...
- Mindless gossip.

296
00:25:56,949 --> 00:25:58,384
But you and aunt Naida
perpetuate it

297
00:25:58,417 --> 00:26:01,086
- by using your gifts so openly.
- [sighs]

298
00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:04,423
We came to this country
so we didn't have to hide.

299
00:26:04,456 --> 00:26:05,557
But we have.

300
00:26:12,064 --> 00:26:14,033
But it's more
than that though, right?

301
00:26:15,267 --> 00:26:17,569
- My isolation...
- Is Sunny up?

302
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:20,372
[thud]

303
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:25,144
[sighs] No.

304
00:26:26,045 --> 00:26:28,147
Not yet.
We're going to crash here

305
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,815
and take off in the morning.

306
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:40,392
[soft sigh]

307
00:26:43,462 --> 00:26:44,363
Thank you...

308
00:26:45,564 --> 00:26:46,999
for an amazing day.

309
00:26:51,337 --> 00:26:52,604
I love you, Mom.

310
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,042
I love you too.

311
00:27:04,616 --> 00:27:05,584
Good night.

312
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:08,887
[soft tense music]

313
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,331
[door closes]

314
00:27:29,208 --> 00:27:31,910
I pushed too hard to have
the wedding here, didn't I?

315
00:27:32,678 --> 00:27:35,614
No, no, no... I'm glad we did.

316
00:27:37,116 --> 00:27:39,218
Just as long
as you don't hold all the...

317
00:27:39,251 --> 00:27:42,354
spitting and...
loud talking and...

318
00:27:42,388 --> 00:27:44,022
monster plants against me.

319
00:27:44,056 --> 00:27:46,325
[soft chuckle] Stop,
you're great.

320
00:27:46,992 --> 00:27:48,394
I'd kill to have a family.

321
00:27:49,729 --> 00:27:50,929
Well, you do now.

322
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:53,232
Mm-hm.

323
00:27:56,235 --> 00:27:59,238
[soft solemn music]

324
00:28:02,708 --> 00:28:04,009
How are you feeling?

325
00:28:06,378 --> 00:28:07,881
Still a bit funky.

326
00:28:10,015 --> 00:28:10,983
But...

327
00:28:12,084 --> 00:28:14,052
I'm sure if you do that thing...

328
00:28:16,622 --> 00:28:17,523
Oh.

329
00:28:18,724 --> 00:28:20,058
Well, say no more.

330
00:28:21,093 --> 00:28:21,994
[soft chuckle]

331
00:28:26,165 --> 00:28:29,568
[Sunny] So... what happened
to your Mom's hand?

332
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:34,106
You really want to talk about
my mom's missing hand right now?

333
00:28:34,473 --> 00:28:36,642
I mean,
it's not like she has a lisp.

334
00:28:38,444 --> 00:28:40,179
[Petar] She lost it
in a car accident

335
00:28:40,212 --> 00:28:41,713
when my birth father died.

336
00:28:41,748 --> 00:28:44,483
[Sunny] Oh.
I'm sorry, I'm such a jerk.

337
00:28:44,516 --> 00:28:45,484
Yeah, you are.

338
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:47,486
[chuckles]

339
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:54,660
Hana!

340
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:56,395
Gosh! Jeez, Matej.

341
00:28:57,095 --> 00:28:58,297
I need to go home.

342
00:28:58,664 --> 00:29:00,466
Yeah, no shit. Come on.

343
00:29:02,234 --> 00:29:03,235
It's okay.

344
00:29:06,638 --> 00:29:08,106
- [thump]
- Ooh!

345
00:29:09,308 --> 00:29:10,309
Are you okay?

346
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:13,278
[mumbling]

347
00:29:25,825 --> 00:29:27,025
[sighs]

348
00:30:01,794 --> 00:30:03,128
[sighs]

349
00:30:03,161 --> 00:30:06,231
[approaching footsteps]

350
00:30:17,342 --> 00:30:19,311
Matej passed out on our couch.

351
00:30:20,579 --> 00:30:23,382
He can't spend the night here.
Can you please take him home?.

352
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:26,151
I will as soon as I'm done.

353
00:30:30,589 --> 00:30:33,125
The bride's side
was especially empty today, huh?

354
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:35,193
On both sides were.

355
00:30:39,431 --> 00:30:41,266
Didn't Petar say
her parents died

356
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,702
when she was young
and she has no other family?

357
00:30:44,269 --> 00:30:46,773
Yeah, but to not even
have a single friend show up?

358
00:30:46,806 --> 00:30:50,175
Well, maybe it was all...
too last minute.

359
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,583
What is found downstream
came from upstream.

360
00:30:57,449 --> 00:30:59,819
[sighs] Okay,
so what's the problem now?

361
00:31:00,887 --> 00:31:03,322
Well, nothing, just don't
you find any of it strange?

362
00:31:03,355 --> 00:31:04,256
No.

363
00:31:04,623 --> 00:31:06,325
We know nothing about her.

364
00:31:06,826 --> 00:31:09,729
I'm beginning to appreciate why
our people arrange marriages.

365
00:31:11,296 --> 00:31:12,698
Well, ours was arranged.

366
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:15,567
Even though I don't know you
any better.

367
00:31:17,469 --> 00:31:18,604
[soft sigh]

368
00:31:24,443 --> 00:31:25,544
I have grown...

369
00:31:26,846 --> 00:31:27,880
to truly...

370
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:29,882
love you.

371
00:31:33,352 --> 00:31:34,319
[soft sigh]

372
00:31:41,226 --> 00:31:42,527
[whispers] I love you too.

373
00:31:42,862 --> 00:31:44,696
[soft tense music]

374
00:32:07,854 --> 00:32:10,455
[tense music intensifies]

375
00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:20,532
[crackling]

376
00:32:23,335 --> 00:32:24,603
[Hana sighs]

377
00:32:35,681 --> 00:32:37,349
[eerie music]

378
00:32:42,822 --> 00:32:45,323
- [soft hissing]
- [crackling]

379
00:32:56,301 --> 00:32:57,770
[sinister note]

380
00:33:05,778 --> 00:33:07,780
[Aishe] <i>You were my best friend!</i>

381
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,783
[chaotic music]

382
00:33:10,817 --> 00:33:11,918
[squelching thud]

383
00:33:13,585 --> 00:33:15,888
[tense music resumes]

384
00:33:25,363 --> 00:33:26,431
[whispers] Forgive me.

385
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,902
[faintly] <i>You were
my best friend.</i>

386
00:33:35,407 --> 00:33:37,242
[faintly] <i>You were
my best friend.</i>

387
00:33:43,315 --> 00:33:44,282
[sighs]

388
00:33:48,653 --> 00:33:50,857
[crackling]

389
00:33:51,958 --> 00:33:52,925
[soft moan]

390
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,792
I am family, let me pass.

391
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,375
My blood will cloak
where you lay.

392
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:12,750
My blood will cloak
where you lay.

393
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:15,833
My blood will cloak
where you lay.

394
00:34:17,708 --> 00:34:19,625
My blood will cloak
where you lay.

395
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,655
[tense music]

396
00:34:24,056 --> 00:34:26,391
[crackling reduces]

397
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:39,471
[woman sighs]

398
00:34:41,941 --> 00:34:44,476
[tense music]

399
00:34:48,547 --> 00:34:49,614
[sighs]

400
00:34:54,887 --> 00:34:55,955
[sighs]

401
00:34:57,522 --> 00:35:00,059
[sinister music]

402
00:35:12,437 --> 00:35:13,338
[sinister note]

403
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:20,000
A resurrection.

404
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,817
[music increases in tempo]

405
00:35:24,851 --> 00:35:26,384
[sinister note]

406
00:35:27,086 --> 00:35:28,888
[tense music]

407
00:35:30,689 --> 00:35:31,924
[soft grunt]

408
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,129
[breathes rapidly]

409
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:41,542
Hana, I curse
your family to die...

410
00:35:42,168 --> 00:35:44,036
[rapid breathing continues]

411
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,503
[tense note]

412
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,875
Hana, I curse
your family to die...

413
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:53,980
[soft grunt]

414
00:35:55,848 --> 00:35:56,749
[tense note]

415
00:35:58,184 --> 00:36:00,052
[sinister growl]

416
00:36:02,654 --> 00:36:03,555
[soft moan]

417
00:36:04,792 --> 00:36:07,250
...by the hand of your...

418
00:36:09,795 --> 00:36:12,164
[thundering]

419
00:36:16,135 --> 00:36:18,603
[breathes rapidly]

420
00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:41,726
[whispering male voice] Matej.

421
00:36:41,761 --> 00:36:42,795
[tense music]

422
00:36:45,697 --> 00:36:46,966
[whisper] Matej.

423
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:48,134
What?

424
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:49,769
[silence]

425
00:36:56,641 --> 00:36:57,743
[soft sigh]

426
00:37:02,782 --> 00:37:05,650
[soft tense music]

427
00:37:19,732 --> 00:37:23,102
[distant howling]

428
00:37:23,736 --> 00:37:26,172
You'd better not
have taken my car, Dani.

429
00:37:28,741 --> 00:37:31,143
[tense music]

430
00:37:41,954 --> 00:37:42,989
[sinister note]

431
00:37:43,022 --> 00:37:44,924
[growling]

432
00:37:49,661 --> 00:37:51,563
[softly] What the hell's that?

433
00:37:59,005 --> 00:38:00,006
[squelching thud]

434
00:38:52,657 --> 00:38:53,359
Hmm.

435
00:38:53,392 --> 00:38:55,094
[soft tense music]

436
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,837
[shivering]

437
00:39:08,841 --> 00:39:09,742
[Petar] Sunny?

438
00:39:09,775 --> 00:39:11,676
[sinister music]

439
00:39:11,911 --> 00:39:13,012
Sunny?

440
00:39:13,045 --> 00:39:15,147
[sinister music accelerates]

441
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:27,359
Your face, I...

442
00:39:28,294 --> 00:39:29,762
What are you doing out here?

443
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:31,997
I um...

444
00:39:32,898 --> 00:39:35,700
I, I don't, I don't know.
I just, um...

445
00:39:37,303 --> 00:39:39,704
I woke up outside and um...

446
00:39:41,774 --> 00:39:42,808
Um...

447
00:39:43,309 --> 00:39:45,845
[Sunny] It's, it's freezing.
Come on.

448
00:39:47,913 --> 00:39:49,681
Petar, come on.

449
00:39:56,088 --> 00:39:57,890
Come on. Let's get you warm.

450
00:39:57,923 --> 00:39:59,691
[soft tense music]

451
00:40:01,427 --> 00:40:03,129
[soft sinister note]

452
00:40:18,177 --> 00:40:20,678
[sinister music]

453
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,060
[door squeaks]

454
00:40:40,032 --> 00:40:42,768
Oh, damnit, Matej.
I can't believe you drove.

455
00:40:48,407 --> 00:40:49,775
[sinister note]

456
00:40:54,046 --> 00:40:55,214
[softly] Oh, shit.

457
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,185
[softly] Oh.

458
00:41:01,153 --> 00:41:03,322
[soft tense music]

459
00:41:13,799 --> 00:41:15,651
Mom, I need a huge cup of joe.

460
00:41:15,708 --> 00:41:17,208
Good morning, sweetheart.

461
00:41:17,236 --> 00:41:18,771
[kiss]

462
00:41:18,804 --> 00:41:20,739
- Oh, you've made <i>kukuruza.</i>
- Mm-hm.

463
00:41:20,773 --> 00:41:22,374
Mmm, very nice.

464
00:41:22,408 --> 00:41:23,909
- Hot!
- Hm.

465
00:41:26,545 --> 00:41:28,180
And <i>sarma.</i>

466
00:41:28,214 --> 00:41:29,114
[sniffs]

467
00:41:30,816 --> 00:41:32,418
- [softly] Very nice.
- Hey!

468
00:41:32,451 --> 00:41:33,352
What?

469
00:41:34,186 --> 00:41:35,154
Mmm.

470
00:41:35,554 --> 00:41:37,423
I can't wait for Sunny
to try this.

471
00:41:38,023 --> 00:41:40,192
I made an extra one for you
to take on the road.

472
00:41:40,859 --> 00:41:41,994
Ah, there it is.

473
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,250
For your health.

474
00:41:45,064 --> 00:41:47,199
We're actually going to
stick around just a day or two.

475
00:41:47,233 --> 00:41:48,968
Sunny's still not feeling 100%.

476
00:41:49,001 --> 00:41:50,135
I'm a little worried
about her leg.

477
00:41:51,136 --> 00:41:52,471
Oh, the <i>sarma.</i>

478
00:41:52,504 --> 00:41:53,739
[soft tense music]

479
00:41:56,809 --> 00:41:57,743
Hey, Mom.

480
00:41:59,378 --> 00:42:02,848
Do you... remember me
sleepwalking as a kid?

481
00:42:02,881 --> 00:42:04,283
Sleepwalking? No.

482
00:42:04,817 --> 00:42:05,884
[Petar] Because I...

483
00:42:06,385 --> 00:42:09,188
I woke up outside
last night and...

484
00:42:10,122 --> 00:42:11,757
- It was...
- [Zara] ...the trash.

485
00:42:12,958 --> 00:42:16,095
What is this troublemaker
doing here?

486
00:42:16,128 --> 00:42:18,897
[soft chuckle] No, seriously,
why are you still here?

487
00:42:19,865 --> 00:42:21,166
Putting off the honeymoon
because you're scared

488
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,801
you won't know what to do?

489
00:42:22,835 --> 00:42:25,404
Sunny's still not feeling good.
Smartass.

490
00:42:29,141 --> 00:42:30,876
You know what,
maybe I should split

491
00:42:30,909 --> 00:42:32,177
before you all scare her off

492
00:42:32,211 --> 00:42:33,579
like you did
my other girlfriends.

493
00:42:33,612 --> 00:42:35,514
It wasn't my fault
you couldn't keep one.

494
00:42:35,981 --> 00:42:37,549
What the hell, it was,
and remember Jennifer Lefton.

495
00:42:37,583 --> 00:42:40,452
I cannot believe
you're still bringing that up.

496
00:42:40,486 --> 00:42:42,454
It started all the rumors
about our family.

497
00:42:42,488 --> 00:42:45,224
Oh, please the rumors
were around way before then.

498
00:42:45,257 --> 00:42:47,092
You mean before
you used your talents

499
00:42:47,126 --> 00:42:49,061
to set those kids' pant legs
on fire

500
00:42:49,094 --> 00:42:51,363
- in front of the library? Huh?
- [Zara laughs]

501
00:42:51,397 --> 00:42:52,398
[Zara] They were making
fun of you

502
00:42:52,431 --> 00:42:53,832
in front of Jennifer.

503
00:42:54,366 --> 00:42:56,001
I was defending your honor.

504
00:42:56,035 --> 00:42:57,369
Yeah, well,
she never spoke to me again.

505
00:42:57,403 --> 00:42:58,971
So, thank you
very much for that.

506
00:42:59,004 --> 00:43:01,073
Well, at least the boys
left you alone.

507
00:43:01,106 --> 00:43:03,175
And so did everyone else
in this town.

508
00:43:05,344 --> 00:43:06,945
I'm just glad Sunny
didn't meet you

509
00:43:06,979 --> 00:43:08,314
before... the wedding.

510
00:43:08,347 --> 00:43:10,849
- No fair.
- [mimicking] No fair.

511
00:43:16,422 --> 00:43:18,123
Oh, hey. Sit down.

512
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,396
I'm sorry about your leg.
Is it better?

513
00:43:24,897 --> 00:43:27,132
Yeah, it should be good as new
in the next few days.

514
00:43:29,501 --> 00:43:32,071
Ah... Are you going
to wear that to work?

515
00:43:32,604 --> 00:43:33,539
Yep.

516
00:43:35,074 --> 00:43:37,009
[Sunny] What kind of work
do you do?

517
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:41,980
Oh.

518
00:43:42,614 --> 00:43:43,615
Let me show you.

519
00:43:44,116 --> 00:43:45,451
Zara, knock it off.

520
00:43:45,484 --> 00:43:48,020
What's the big deal?
She's family.

521
00:43:48,987 --> 00:43:50,255
No secrets allowed.

522
00:43:50,289 --> 00:43:51,924
[Hana] Yeah, it's okay.

523
00:43:51,957 --> 00:43:53,659
Zara comes from a long line
of gifted women.

524
00:43:53,692 --> 00:43:55,627
She's known as one
of the intuitives.

525
00:43:55,661 --> 00:43:56,628
- Fortune tellers.
- Hey.

526
00:43:57,696 --> 00:44:00,599
Don't listen to him.
It's a well-respected gift.

527
00:44:03,369 --> 00:44:04,603
[soft sinister note]

528
00:44:06,605 --> 00:44:09,007
[tense music]

529
00:44:21,553 --> 00:44:23,922
Ma, ma, maybe we should do this
a little bit later.

530
00:44:33,165 --> 00:44:34,066
What?

531
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,935
Uh, why don't you
go check on Sunny?

532
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:39,371
Go on.

533
00:44:43,709 --> 00:44:45,677
[softly] Were you able
to pick up anything?

534
00:44:45,711 --> 00:44:47,312
Only that she's pregnant?

535
00:44:49,314 --> 00:44:51,183
She's preg... What?

536
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,554
Oh, God.

537
00:44:58,023 --> 00:44:59,625
That'll just complicate
our bindings.

538
00:45:02,261 --> 00:45:04,096
What else did you see?

539
00:45:04,129 --> 00:45:05,531
I don't know.

540
00:45:05,564 --> 00:45:07,666
It was... all jumbled.
I needed more time.

541
00:45:09,601 --> 00:45:11,170
She's still limping.

542
00:45:12,471 --> 00:45:14,706
Mom said that you put
healing <i>trava</i> under her bed.

543
00:45:14,741 --> 00:45:17,042
I did. I did put healing <i>trava</i>
under her bed.

544
00:45:17,075 --> 00:45:19,344
She should have been completely
better by this morning.

545
00:45:20,279 --> 00:45:21,180
Mm.

546
00:45:21,748 --> 00:45:23,482
I cannot get enough of this.

547
00:45:25,451 --> 00:45:26,351
Listen...

548
00:45:28,053 --> 00:45:29,455
You're just overthinking this.

549
00:45:29,488 --> 00:45:31,323
We're not used to having
so many people around.

550
00:45:32,257 --> 00:45:33,158
Maybe.

551
00:45:34,626 --> 00:45:36,295
Thanks again for helping
with the wedding stuff.

552
00:45:36,328 --> 00:45:37,329
I appreciate it.

553
00:45:37,362 --> 00:45:38,630
[clock chimes]

554
00:45:40,265 --> 00:45:42,034
Oh, crap, I gotta go.

555
00:45:42,067 --> 00:45:42,968
What's the rush?

556
00:45:43,669 --> 00:45:45,003
What?

557
00:45:45,037 --> 00:45:46,538
I'm meeting someone for lunch.

558
00:45:46,572 --> 00:45:47,740
A local boy?

559
00:45:48,842 --> 00:45:51,043
When was the last time
one of our own asked me out?

560
00:45:51,443 --> 00:45:53,145
I'll tell you when. Never.

561
00:45:53,545 --> 00:45:55,280
Fine. Tell me about your date.

562
00:45:55,714 --> 00:45:57,583
His name is Dale DeLois Smith.

563
00:45:57,616 --> 00:45:59,451
I don't care about his name.

564
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:03,388
All right, you know Arnold's?
The hair salon over on Pacific?

565
00:46:03,422 --> 00:46:05,324
- Yes.
- His mom runs that.

566
00:46:05,691 --> 00:46:07,526
- Okay.
- Is that enough for you now?

567
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:08,660
- Yes.
- Okay.

568
00:46:10,395 --> 00:46:12,464
- I love you. Thank you.
- [Zara] I love you too.

569
00:46:19,471 --> 00:46:22,140
[soft tense music]

570
00:46:28,247 --> 00:46:29,181
[tense note]

571
00:46:29,515 --> 00:46:30,415
[sighs]

572
00:46:35,554 --> 00:46:37,589
[tense music intensifies]

573
00:46:38,791 --> 00:46:41,293
I want answers, not games.

574
00:46:42,394 --> 00:46:43,462
[knocking]

575
00:46:44,696 --> 00:46:46,131
[music fades]

576
00:46:48,233 --> 00:46:49,535
- Yeah?
- [door squeaks]

577
00:46:51,804 --> 00:46:52,805
Who were you talking to?

578
00:46:54,306 --> 00:46:55,274
[sighs] No one.

579
00:47:04,784 --> 00:47:06,151
I'm sorry about Zara.

580
00:47:06,585 --> 00:47:08,420
She's... [soft chuckle]

581
00:47:10,422 --> 00:47:11,490
It's fine.

582
00:47:22,234 --> 00:47:24,369
[soft somber music]

583
00:47:29,776 --> 00:47:31,443
We're forever, you and I.

584
00:47:36,883 --> 00:47:38,517
You've stolen my heart.

585
00:47:40,218 --> 00:47:40,853
[thud]

586
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:42,855
[soft tense music]

587
00:48:03,575 --> 00:48:05,510
[soft chuckle] Okay.

588
00:48:05,812 --> 00:48:07,579
We really have to go
somewhere else.

589
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:09,448
Let's go in the house then.

590
00:48:09,949 --> 00:48:11,316
This place is legend.

591
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:12,651
Oh, no. I mean, we gotta go...

592
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:15,387
Wait... What did you say?

593
00:48:15,955 --> 00:48:18,457
<i>Witch, old witch
Do you live in a house</i>

594
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:20,659
<i>Or do you live in a haystack
With the red-eyed crows?</i>

595
00:48:21,794 --> 00:48:22,862
Come on,
who can say they've done it

596
00:48:22,895 --> 00:48:23,863
in the bloody witch house?

597
00:48:25,798 --> 00:48:27,165
Go home.

598
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:29,668
I don't think so, beautiful.

599
00:48:30,435 --> 00:48:31,838
- I said go home.
- [sinister music]

600
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,707
[buzzing]

601
00:48:39,611 --> 00:48:40,512
Ah!

602
00:48:40,545 --> 00:48:41,647
Ah!

603
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,349
Stop it, you crazy bitch. Argh!

604
00:48:45,350 --> 00:48:46,485
[yelling continues]

605
00:48:46,518 --> 00:48:47,754
[sudden silence]

606
00:48:48,755 --> 00:48:49,655
Go!

607
00:48:57,596 --> 00:49:00,767
Now, before you say anything,
I know that I broke the rules.

608
00:49:01,266 --> 00:49:02,534
I shouldn't have brought
him here.

609
00:49:04,336 --> 00:49:06,806
He was just another asshole
looking for a haunted tour.

610
00:49:07,673 --> 00:49:11,610
Our people are in good practice
of recognizing insincerity.

611
00:49:12,244 --> 00:49:12,879
Usually.

612
00:49:14,312 --> 00:49:15,782
Why don't they
just leave us alone?

613
00:49:16,381 --> 00:49:18,751
Coming to the States
didn't change what we hoped.

614
00:49:19,618 --> 00:49:20,987
Others still project their...

615
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,622
Their repressed reverie onto us.
I know.

616
00:49:27,259 --> 00:49:28,560
Has everyone gone?

617
00:49:29,996 --> 00:49:30,863
No.

618
00:49:31,731 --> 00:49:33,900
Mom, you can't just chase
them out.

619
00:49:33,933 --> 00:49:36,435
Something needs to be done.
I received a warning.

620
00:49:36,468 --> 00:49:37,970
It's because they're here.
I know it.

621
00:49:38,004 --> 00:49:39,872
Listen, you need to do
something for me.

622
00:49:39,906 --> 00:49:41,774
You need to go back to the shop
and wait for me there,

623
00:49:41,808 --> 00:49:43,642
and do not leave until I say so.

624
00:49:43,675 --> 00:49:45,945
No, please, please, please,
just go.

625
00:49:49,782 --> 00:49:52,284
[soft sinister music]

626
00:49:55,554 --> 00:49:56,455
[crackling]

627
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:59,333
I am family, let me pass.

628
00:50:04,329 --> 00:50:05,664
[tense music]

629
00:50:09,902 --> 00:50:11,670
[music intensifies]

630
00:50:11,703 --> 00:50:12,704
My hand!

631
00:50:13,538 --> 00:50:14,606
The curse...

632
00:50:16,776 --> 00:50:18,276
It's been released.

633
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:22,481
Naida!

634
00:50:23,482 --> 00:50:25,283
[Hana breathes heavily]

635
00:50:25,317 --> 00:50:26,919
[Naida] You just sealed
our fate.

636
00:50:27,486 --> 00:50:29,789
[Hana] We don't know
that she finished the curse.

637
00:50:29,822 --> 00:50:31,456
We didn't hear the final words.

638
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:33,458
You're on your own now.

639
00:50:34,961 --> 00:50:37,696
What? No, Naida.
Naida, get back here.

640
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:39,031
We can figure this out.

641
00:50:40,532 --> 00:50:43,435
[tense music accelerates]

642
00:50:43,468 --> 00:50:44,569
[soft groan]

643
00:51:08,027 --> 00:51:08,928
[knocking]

644
00:51:09,628 --> 00:51:10,763
Can I come in?

645
00:51:10,797 --> 00:51:12,064
Hey, come on in. Come on in.

646
00:51:12,098 --> 00:51:13,698
I was just about to take
a break.

647
00:51:17,937 --> 00:51:21,073
So, how's outside world
treating you, my son?

648
00:51:22,574 --> 00:51:24,509
World's fine. It's just...

649
00:51:24,911 --> 00:51:27,579
Our people's place in it.
It's ambivalent, you know.

650
00:51:27,612 --> 00:51:29,816
Yeah, most of our people
feel the same.

651
00:51:31,416 --> 00:51:33,552
How will anyone
ever take my work seriously

652
00:51:33,585 --> 00:51:35,755
when even my own professors
believe our people

653
00:51:35,788 --> 00:51:37,556
don't even know what a radio is.

654
00:51:38,124 --> 00:51:40,492
The written word
will be our sword.

655
00:51:40,525 --> 00:51:41,426
You'll see.

656
00:51:43,595 --> 00:51:45,064
You... mind
if I take your drink?

657
00:51:46,464 --> 00:51:47,365
Sure.

658
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:54,439
So, what you're working on
these days?

659
00:51:56,876 --> 00:51:59,711
It's a more a...
personal project.

660
00:52:04,851 --> 00:52:08,353
It's an heirloom of sorts...
for you and Zara.

661
00:52:08,821 --> 00:52:10,722
When we're gone, you know.

662
00:52:11,123 --> 00:52:13,458
The... story of our family.

663
00:52:13,826 --> 00:52:17,163
Oh? I didn't know we were
such an interesting bunch.

664
00:52:17,196 --> 00:52:20,565
[soft chuckle]
You'd be surprised.

665
00:52:21,466 --> 00:52:22,601
We...

666
00:52:24,036 --> 00:52:26,105
We used to be part
of a larger family.

667
00:52:27,006 --> 00:52:28,007
[Petar] What happened?

668
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:29,608
Well, an awful event.

669
00:52:30,009 --> 00:52:31,777
[sinister music]

670
00:52:35,047 --> 00:52:36,615
So wait, you're...

671
00:52:36,916 --> 00:52:38,918
You're saying
the rumors are true then?

672
00:52:39,718 --> 00:52:41,419
That we had something to do
with that missing couple.

673
00:52:41,453 --> 00:52:44,790
Don't listen to the rumors.
They are like odors.

674
00:52:44,824 --> 00:52:47,059
The more pungent they are,
the easier they spread.

675
00:52:47,093 --> 00:52:48,560
That's all. [sniffs]

676
00:52:49,195 --> 00:52:53,799
Every family does have some...
some buried secrets.

677
00:52:53,833 --> 00:52:55,467
Ours is no exception.

678
00:52:59,972 --> 00:53:04,043
Do... some of those secrets
include my birth father

679
00:53:04,076 --> 00:53:04,977
by any chance?

680
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:07,712
[tense music]

681
00:53:14,787 --> 00:53:15,687
I see.

682
00:53:19,658 --> 00:53:20,692
[sighs]

683
00:53:31,536 --> 00:53:32,437
[sighs]

684
00:53:43,783 --> 00:53:46,718
[approaching footsteps]

685

[sinister music]

686
00:54:00,066 --> 00:54:01,100
I know you're here.

687
00:54:02,667 --> 00:54:04,170
Why don't you just
show yourself?

688
00:54:05,137 --> 00:54:07,472
- [growling]
- [music accelerates]

689
00:54:12,945 --> 00:54:15,147

00:54:20,019 --> 00:54:22,054

00:54:22,687 --> 00:54:23,588

[music ends]

693
00:54:35,901 --> 00:54:36,802
Petar!

694
00:54:47,813 --> 00:54:49,882
[sinister music]

695
00:54:51,884 --> 00:54:53,119
[footsteps running]

696
00:54:53,152 --> 00:54:54,053
[Dani] Hana!

697
00:54:55,888 --> 00:54:57,189
Is everything okay?

698
00:54:57,223 --> 00:54:58,590
[Hana] Fine. I was in my garden.

699
00:54:58,623 --> 00:55:00,092
What are you doing here?

700
00:55:00,126 --> 00:55:01,994
I'm looking for Matej.
He never came home.

701
00:55:02,028 --> 00:55:03,229
Nikola gave him a lift
last night.

702
00:55:03,262 --> 00:55:04,964
I checked with everyone.

703
00:55:04,997 --> 00:55:06,799
I'm sorry, I don't have time
for this right now.

704
00:55:07,733 --> 00:55:09,201
Then let me talk to Nikola.

705
00:55:09,235 --> 00:55:11,037
He can at least tell me
where he dropped him off.

706
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:12,138
Hana!

707
00:55:12,171 --> 00:55:13,571
- [sinister music]
- [thud]

708
00:55:16,275 --> 00:55:17,777
[gate squeaks]

709
00:55:19,011 --> 00:55:19,912
What the hell!

710
00:55:29,687 --> 00:55:31,257
[Petar] Nikola,
I want to apologize.

711
00:55:53,913 --> 00:55:54,814
[tense music]

712
00:55:55,247 --> 00:55:56,681
[knocking]

713
00:56:15,935 --> 00:56:17,635
"This curse
is extremely powerful

and is forbidden to cast.

715

Its purpose is solely
to exterminate

an enemy's beloved bloodline."

717
00:56:23,876 --> 00:56:25,344
Exterminating a bloodline.

[tense music]

723
00:56:54,006 --> 00:56:56,208
[soft creaking]

724
00:57:01,981 --> 00:57:03,048
[sinister note]

725
00:57:04,383 --> 00:57:05,284
Petar.

726
00:57:09,822 --> 00:57:10,890
I was um...

727
00:57:12,724 --> 00:57:14,894
I was just looking for Nikola.

728
00:57:15,327 --> 00:57:16,295
Okay.

729
00:57:32,077 --> 00:57:33,245
[sighs]

730
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:37,958
Unseen come forth.

731
00:57:38,784 --> 00:57:40,753
[sinister music]

732
00:57:48,861 --> 00:57:51,330
[eerie music]

733
00:57:55,234 --> 00:57:58,103
[tense music]

734
00:58:01,875 --> 00:58:06,583
You can't hide a cat in a sack,
its claws will reveal them.

735
00:58:09,915 --> 00:58:10,816
[soft sigh]

736
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:21,961
[tearful] I can't help it
that I fell in love with him.

737
00:58:23,862 --> 00:58:25,864
[dramatic music]

738
00:58:29,368 --> 00:58:30,302
[sighs]

739
00:58:35,941 --> 00:58:37,209
[sinister note]

740
00:58:39,245 --> 00:58:40,145
[sighs]

741
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:48,083
Reveal the secret
of the one who owns this scarf.

742
00:58:48,167 --> 00:58:51,042
Reveal the secret
of the one who owns this scarf.

743
00:58:51,125 --> 00:58:53,479
Reveal the secret
of the one who owns this scarf.

744
00:58:53,559 --> 00:58:56,195
[dramatic music]

745
00:59:05,204 --> 00:59:06,105
[dramatic note]

746
00:59:06,538 --> 00:59:07,506
[sucks teeth]

747
00:59:07,539 --> 00:59:08,540
[groans]

748
00:59:09,708 --> 00:59:11,750
May the secret of the one
who owns this scarf be revealed.

749
00:59:11,877 --> 00:59:14,380
[girl] <i>Are you certain
you've found Aishe's life blood</i>

750
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,317
I've told you this
many times already, child.

751
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:20,853
But I just don't understand,
<i>tante</i> Galina.

752
00:59:21,153 --> 00:59:23,389
Why can't you call
upon her spirit?

753
00:59:24,023 --> 00:59:25,324
[sighs] When I've tried...

754
00:59:26,258 --> 00:59:28,294
I have been met with only images

755
00:59:29,028 --> 00:59:30,462
of the friends
who betrayed her...

756
00:59:32,097 --> 00:59:33,365
<i>or firethorn...</i>

757
00:59:35,234 --> 00:59:38,170
The blood veil
they have created,

758
00:59:38,604 --> 00:59:42,141
hiding the location
of her body from my sight.

759
00:59:44,276 --> 00:59:46,378
Such a spell would require

760
00:59:46,412 --> 00:59:50,416
the painful
bloodletting sacrifice.

761
00:59:50,449 --> 00:59:52,418
They are unrelenting...

762
00:59:53,986 --> 00:59:55,954
and quite powerful.

763
00:59:55,988 --> 00:59:58,891
But we are all powerful
and gifted people.

764
00:59:59,325 --> 01:00:01,493
Why, why can't I go
after her now?

765
01:00:01,527 --> 01:00:02,461
You can't.

766
01:00:03,128 --> 01:00:04,163
I told you.

767
01:00:04,196 --> 01:00:05,564
They are watching.

768
01:00:05,597 --> 01:00:07,166
They are on guard.

769
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:09,168
This is only work

770
01:00:09,201 --> 01:00:12,338
if you move like a thief
in the night...

771
01:00:13,172 --> 01:00:14,340
Alison.

772
01:00:15,174 --> 01:00:16,342
Patience.

773
01:00:16,975 --> 01:00:20,045
Yes, your name
is not Leila anymore.

774
01:00:20,312 --> 01:00:22,381
It's Alison Robertson.

775
01:00:24,249 --> 01:00:25,918
Very American.

776
01:00:27,152 --> 01:00:29,188
Pay close attention.

777
01:00:35,594 --> 01:00:37,329
Remember this name.

778
01:00:38,097 --> 01:00:40,632
He will be the one
to give you the words

779
01:00:40,666 --> 01:00:43,569
that will help you pass
through the firethorn,

780
01:00:43,602 --> 01:00:46,271
which hides Aishe's body,

781
01:00:46,305 --> 01:00:49,108
so you can release her spirit

782
01:00:49,141 --> 01:00:52,544
and she can go rest
with her ancestors.

783
01:00:55,447 --> 01:00:58,083
Look for the heaviest covering

784
01:00:59,218 --> 01:01:01,086
and you will find her.

785
01:01:03,222 --> 01:01:04,356
Remember...

786
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,962
Remember.

787
01:01:09,995 --> 01:01:11,997
- [sinister fluttering]
- [Hana groans]

788
01:01:13,098 --> 01:01:14,233
[groans]

789
01:01:15,334 --> 01:01:16,235
[grunts]

790
01:01:16,568 --> 01:01:19,037
[deep breaths]

791
01:01:21,407 --> 01:01:23,575
[soft tense music]

792
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:32,451
[grunts]

793
01:01:33,333 --> 01:01:34,667
Heal me.

794
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:36,667
Heal me.

795
01:01:37,417 --> 01:01:38,500
Heal me.

796
01:01:39,417 --> 01:01:40,583
Heal me.

797
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:42,667
Heal me.

798
01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:44,630
[soft moan]

799
01:01:46,365 --> 01:01:48,200
[music fades]

800
01:02:01,447 --> 01:02:02,714
[footsteps]

801
01:02:05,217 --> 01:02:06,151
Your eyes!

802
01:02:07,085 --> 01:02:08,387
Aishe's been freed.

803
01:02:09,087 --> 01:02:11,190
It was Sunny.
She's Aishe's sister.

804
01:02:11,223 --> 01:02:12,624
[tense music]

805
01:02:15,494 --> 01:02:17,463
- I needed more time.
- No!

806
01:02:17,496 --> 01:02:19,665
No, no, we're not
giving up, Nikola.

807
01:02:19,698 --> 01:02:22,000
You know as well as I do,
there's nothing

808
01:02:22,034 --> 01:02:23,736
that can nullify this curse.

809
01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:25,571
[Hana] There's one thing
we can try.

810
01:02:26,104 --> 01:02:28,507
Now, you said the only way
the curse could be stopped

811
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:31,009
is if the person who cast it
calls it back, right?

812
01:02:31,043 --> 01:02:34,613
What if I bind my spirit
with Aishe's?

813
01:02:35,147 --> 01:02:36,482
With our spirits intertwined,

814
01:02:36,515 --> 01:02:37,649
maybe I would be able
to call it back.

815
01:02:37,683 --> 01:02:39,017
I will not let you risk

816
01:02:39,051 --> 01:02:40,385
eternal damnation of your soul

817
01:02:40,419 --> 01:02:41,420
based on my hunch!

818
01:02:41,453 --> 01:02:42,454
We have no other options.

819
01:02:42,488 --> 01:02:44,256
Well, that's not one!

820
01:02:45,324 --> 01:02:47,359
Let's at least try
and reach out to the ancestors.

821
01:02:47,392 --> 01:02:49,361
And do what? And do what?
Evoke their help

822
01:02:49,394 --> 01:02:51,163
for a crime we've kept hidden?

823
01:02:51,463 --> 01:02:53,999
One they deem unforgivable.

824
01:02:55,133 --> 01:02:56,468
Don't you see?

825
01:02:57,703 --> 01:03:01,173
We are exactly where we are
because they want us to be here.

826
01:03:02,407 --> 01:03:04,476
[tense music]

827
01:03:06,512 --> 01:03:08,447
Swear to me, you won't try it.

828
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:12,417
Swear it.

829
01:03:18,223 --> 01:03:20,092
You have to go
and tell Petar everything.

830
01:03:20,125 --> 01:03:21,627
He needs to know
what's happening.

831
01:03:24,596 --> 01:03:26,398
You knew one day
you would have to tell him

832
01:03:26,431 --> 01:03:27,734
the truth about his father.

833
01:03:33,105 --> 01:03:34,072
[tense note]

834
01:03:35,541 --> 01:03:37,342
- Petar.
- Have you lied to me about him,

835
01:03:37,376 --> 01:03:38,778
- this whole time?
- [sighs]

836
01:03:38,811 --> 01:03:40,279
There's more to it than that.

837
01:03:40,312 --> 01:03:42,648
[Petar yells]
Start talking! Now!

838
01:03:46,285 --> 01:03:47,352
[Hana] Look...

839
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:49,756
This is charged, okay?

840
01:03:49,789 --> 01:03:52,457
And it'll help ward off
the evil that's around her.

841
01:03:53,793 --> 01:03:54,693
[kiss]

842
01:03:54,726 --> 01:03:55,762
Take it.

843
01:03:58,898 --> 01:04:00,299
[music accelerates]

[Petar breathes rapidly] Sunny?

[Zara] A bat.

859
01:05:45,570 --> 01:05:46,705
Prediction of death.

860
01:05:51,978 --> 01:05:52,879
That's it?

861
01:05:54,781 --> 01:05:55,714
[soft sigh]

862
01:06:03,722 --> 01:06:05,390
Okay. I'm definitely losing it.

[sinister note]

872
01:06:33,585 --> 01:06:35,287
[Sunny] Do not ignore me.

873
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:40,860
[yells] Just tell me
what you want me to do.

874
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:42,694
Please!

01:06:48,667 --> 01:06:51,037

Aishe!

880
01:07:09,856 --> 01:07:11,556
If I could take back
what happened,

881
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:13,960
I swear to you on everything
that's dear to me...

882

Damn you! Just take me!

[approaching footsteps]

890
01:07:40,753 --> 01:07:42,654
- [Nikola] Hana!
- It's fine.

891
01:07:42,687 --> 01:07:43,722
What, was it Aishe?

892
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:47,459
Are you absolutely certain?

893
01:07:47,794 --> 01:07:49,694
She said the final words
to the curse?

894
01:07:51,463 --> 01:07:52,631
[tense music]

895
01:07:52,664 --> 01:07:53,766
Without a doubt.

896
01:07:54,466 --> 01:07:55,333
I need...

897
01:07:57,435 --> 01:07:58,470
You should just go.

898
01:07:58,971 --> 01:08:00,672
You're not part
of the bloodline.

899
01:08:00,705 --> 01:08:03,042
- The curse won't follow you.
- I'm not going anywhere.

900
01:08:04,110 --> 01:08:06,813
I just can't believe
there's nothing we can do.

901
01:08:09,148 --> 01:08:10,315
Wait a minute.

902
01:08:10,917 --> 01:08:11,818
Not us.

903
01:08:12,684 --> 01:08:13,853
Her sister.

904
01:08:14,653 --> 01:08:16,388
Aishe wasn't expecting Sunny

905
01:08:16,421 --> 01:08:18,024
to get wrapped up
in all of this.

906
01:08:19,558 --> 01:08:20,960
Sunny's pregnant.

[sinister music]

908
01:08:24,864 --> 01:08:27,499
Then she's carrying your lineage
inside her.

909
01:08:27,532 --> 01:08:29,936
Yes, Sunny can plead
for the curse to be reversed

910
01:08:29,969 --> 01:08:32,437
because it will affect her
and her child.

911
01:08:32,939 --> 01:08:34,774
Go get Naida and Zara.
We need them.

912
01:08:36,708 --> 01:08:37,609
[Hana] I love you.

913
01:08:43,883 --> 01:08:45,885

[distant thundering]

916
01:09:09,641 --> 01:09:10,743
A storm's coming.

917
01:09:11,676 --> 01:09:13,578
[tense music]

918
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:19,584
I'm pregnant.

919
01:09:28,794 --> 01:09:29,728
That's...

920
01:09:30,796 --> 01:09:32,098
That's a bit too tight.

921
01:09:35,801 --> 01:09:36,701
Petar...

922
01:09:38,871 --> 01:09:39,972
Petar.

923
01:09:41,073 --> 01:09:42,108
[Petar] Sunny, What the hell?

924
01:09:42,707 --> 01:09:44,043
Didn't you hear me?

925
01:09:45,978 --> 01:09:47,880
- [sinister music]
- God, you're bleeding.

926
01:09:49,849 --> 01:09:50,917
Oh, my God.

927
01:09:53,085 --> 01:09:54,619
Here, come inside.

928
01:09:54,653 --> 01:09:56,488
I'll go take care of this
in the room.

929
01:09:56,521 --> 01:09:57,890
You just, you go wash up.

930
01:10:05,731 --> 01:10:07,099
[sinister music]

931
01:10:08,834 --> 01:10:10,836
- [music accelerates]
- [Petar] What the hell!

932
01:10:15,241 --> 01:10:16,474
Why isn't this coming off?

933
01:10:23,983 --> 01:10:25,785
[whispers] It'll never come off.

934
01:10:28,054 --> 01:10:29,188

[sinister music]

937
01:10:42,868 --> 01:10:43,869
What happened?

938
01:10:49,041 --> 01:10:51,110
You had something to do
with her death, didn't you?

939
01:10:53,846 --> 01:10:56,115
- Yes.
- [tense music]

940
01:10:58,583 --> 01:11:00,485
It was my greatest mistake.

941
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:01,754
Nikola's notes.

942
01:11:02,822 --> 01:11:05,024
They mentioned a horrible curse
put on our family.

943
01:11:05,057 --> 01:11:06,792
She's the one
that placed it on us?

944
01:11:07,726 --> 01:11:09,295
[Hana] It's
the Abolishment Curse.

945
01:11:09,328 --> 01:11:11,629
It's meant to kill off
our branch of the family tree.

946
01:11:11,663 --> 01:11:13,565
[Petar] You let me bring Sunny
into this?

947
01:11:13,598 --> 01:11:16,168
[Hana] No. She's the one
who released it, but now,

948
01:11:16,202 --> 01:11:17,770
now she's the only one
that can help us.

949
01:11:17,803 --> 01:11:19,271
[Petar] Help us?

950
01:11:19,305 --> 01:11:21,539
Don't you dare drag her
into any of this shit.

951
01:11:21,573 --> 01:11:22,742
She already is.

952
01:11:23,242 --> 01:11:25,677
[tense music]

953
01:11:26,578 --> 01:11:27,679
I gotta get her out of here.

954
01:11:27,712 --> 01:11:28,914
[Hana] No, no, no... [gasps]

955
01:11:31,616 --> 01:11:32,485
You okay?

956
01:11:33,252 --> 01:11:34,153
[softly] Yeah.

957
01:11:35,087 --> 01:11:37,056
- Son...
- I'm not your son.

958
01:11:37,089 --> 01:11:38,924
[tense music continues]

959
01:11:45,831 --> 01:11:46,832
Let him go.

960
01:11:46,866 --> 01:11:47,767
[sighs]

961
01:11:49,101 --> 01:11:50,269
When this is all over...

962
01:11:51,203 --> 01:11:53,205
you and I will leave
this place together.

963
01:11:54,073 --> 01:11:55,274
We'll start over again.

964
01:11:56,342 --> 01:11:57,542
Never look back.

965
01:12:02,181 --> 01:12:03,783
Go get Naida and Zara.

966
01:12:04,616 --> 01:12:06,252
I need to go find Sunny, okay?

967
01:12:19,631 --> 01:12:21,666
- [sinister music]
- [Sunny cries] Oh, God, no.

968
01:12:22,001 --> 01:12:23,635
It's not mine.

969
01:12:24,103 --> 01:12:25,337
[cries]

970
01:12:25,938 --> 01:12:27,605
It's not my blood.

971
01:12:28,941 --> 01:12:31,343
<i>Tante</i> Galina said nothing
about your curse.

972
01:12:31,944 --> 01:12:34,113
If I would have known
I never would've come here.

973
01:12:34,146 --> 01:12:36,015
I only wanted to set you free.

974
01:12:37,917 --> 01:12:40,119
You have to convince Aishe
to end it,

975
01:12:40,152 --> 01:12:43,289
for your unborn child's sake
before the bloodshed starts.

976
01:12:45,224 --> 01:12:47,193
[soft sinister music]

977
01:12:47,226 --> 01:12:47,993
It's begun.

978
01:12:49,895 --> 01:12:52,131
There was so much blood
on my hands.

979
01:12:54,066 --> 01:12:55,301
Oh, my God, it's you.

980
01:12:55,868 --> 01:12:57,635
That's, that's not possible.

981
01:12:57,669 --> 01:12:59,371
Aishe should have known
that when you place a curse

982
01:12:59,405 --> 01:13:01,207
it comes back to her threefold.

983
01:13:01,774 --> 01:13:03,209
Your sister's spirit is damned.

984
01:13:03,675 --> 01:13:05,077
And now, so are you.

985
01:13:05,111 --> 01:13:07,813
I will not let you damn my son.

Mom?

[tense music]

990
01:13:25,931 --> 01:13:26,832
[Zara] It's me.

- [crackling]

992
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:35,292
I am family, let me pass.

993
01:13:37,042 --> 01:13:38,878
I will put you back
in this pit of hell

994
01:13:38,911 --> 01:13:39,979
where you belong.

I, um...

01:15:01,927 --> 01:15:04,430
I... I thought
I'd get a head start and...

pack some bags into the car.

You know, I...

I'd never mean
to have hurt you, Petar.

1025
01:15:55,914 --> 01:15:56,815
Right?

1026
01:16:00,419 --> 01:16:01,987
I'm not following, Sunny.

[Hana] Remember our moment.

During your darkest of times

1040
01:16:47,833 --> 01:16:49,833

What the hell is happening?

1045
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:03,148
Listen to me.
We have very little time.

- No. No, honey.

1062

I made a vow.

I betrayed my best friend
with her husband...

Your father.

1065
01:17:48,293 --> 01:17:50,262
So any blood, honey,
is on my hands.

1066
01:17:50,295 --> 01:17:52,498
