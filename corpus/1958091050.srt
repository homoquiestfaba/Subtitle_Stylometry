All right, is that it?

180
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:47,118
Let's see what
we're doing today.

00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:48,555
200 repeats, 16 of them.

182
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:50,644
We just did this.

183
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:54,343
Coach Simpson, we just did
200 repeats a couple days ago.

184
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:55,518
[COACH SIMPSON] Yeah, I know.

185

I combining everybody today.

00:07:57,346 --> 00:07:59,957
Well, can the 400 girls
do something different?

187
00:08:00,131 --> 00:08:03,308
Sure, you can do 20
of 'em, how's that?

188
00:08:05,223 --> 00:08:06,616
You know, Leah,
you question almost

189
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,313
every workout I give you.

190
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,533
Sorry Coach, it's
just we just did these.

191
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:12,579
Well, I think
you need 'em again.

192
00:08:12,753 --> 00:08:14,363
Our relay team has a
lot of ground to gain

193
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:17,322
if we wanna qualify
for the regional.

- I don't like her.
- Uh, yeah, we can see that.

196
00:08:23,415 --> 00:08:25,113
She doesn't know
what she's doing.

197

Come on, Leah, she's a
good coach and you know that.

- Mrs. Price,

200
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:35,123
you wanted to see me?

201
00:08:35,297 --> 00:08:38,256
Yes, Coach Donnelly, come
in, come in, take a seat.

202

Oh, how many times have I
told you to call me Karen?

- So, how you doing?
- Good, good, how are you?

206
00:08:48,005 --> 00:08:50,660
Well, normally my job
as Assistant Principal

207
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:52,314
is about putting out fires,

208
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:56,057
but today I have some
good news to report.

209
00:08:56,231 --> 00:08:58,929
I got approval from the board
and next spring we're going

210
00:08:59,103 --> 00:09:01,541
to field our first ever golf
team at Orange Hills Academy.

211
00:09:01,715 --> 00:09:03,412
Oh, that'll be good.

212
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:05,022
Every other private school
in the state's had golf

213
00:09:05,196 --> 00:09:06,676
for years and we're just
now getting around to it,

214
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,158
but we finally arrived
and I need a coach.

215
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,900
That's where you come in.

216
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:14,423
Now, I know you're
a good golfer,

217
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:16,773
so don't try to
tell me you're not.

218
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:19,341
I'd like to offer
you the job first.

219
00:09:19,515 --> 00:09:21,561
The pay's about the same as
you get for cross country,

220
00:09:21,735 --> 00:09:24,172
so I know that's not
really much incentive.

221
00:09:24,346 --> 00:09:26,609
But here's the agreement.

222
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,480
Thank you so much.

223
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:32,528
I'm honored and flattered
and definitely interested.

If it's okay with
you, I'd like to talk

225
00:09:33,877 --> 00:09:35,487
it over with my husband first.

226
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:38,273
Of course, of
course, take your time.

227
00:09:38,447 --> 00:09:40,144
Take the agreement
home, talk it over.

228

Like I said, we're in no hurry.

you, young lady.

00:10:19,096 --> 00:10:22,099
She's the best female
800 runner I've ever had.

248
00:10:22,273 --> 00:10:23,927
I'm really glad for her.

249
00:10:24,101 --> 00:10:25,494
Hey, would you mind if I asked

250
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:26,887
a quick question
about the race today?

251
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:28,584
Sure, go ahead.

252
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:30,020
I just noticed that
she ran her first lap

253
00:10:30,194 --> 00:10:32,501
4.2 seconds faster
than her second.

254
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:34,024
Do you think that
if she evened out

255
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:36,766
those splits she
could go even faster?

256
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,856
I would agree with
you except it's the 800.

257
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,729
800 is the most unique
running event there is.

258
00:10:42,903 --> 00:10:45,079
Ah, I'm not sure I understand.

259
00:10:45,253 --> 00:10:47,081
You run the 5k in
cross country, right?

260
00:10:47,255 --> 00:10:48,778
- Right.
- That's pacing.

This is an all out
endurance sprint.

00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,304
Check the world records
in the distance events,

263
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:56,699
they are basically all even
splits, so I agree with you.

264
00:10:56,873 --> 00:10:59,571
This 800, it's different.

265
00:10:59,746 --> 00:11:01,138
Almost every world record
in that event through

266

with positive splits.

coaching immediately.

He doesn't have an
assistant coach to help with

318
00:12:58,255 --> 00:13:02,564
the distance runners and he
asked me if I would help out.

319

But specifically if I
would coach Brittany.

320

Okay, but, how are you
gonna pull all of that off?

321

that I could drive

322
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,529
over there three days a week.

323
00:13:11,703 --> 00:13:13,096
And on those days, practice
could just start later

324
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,752
to accommodate my
drive and it would pay

325
00:13:16,926 --> 00:13:18,754
and the school would
cover my expenses,

326
00:13:18,928 --> 00:13:21,801

by the athletic director.

for the regional.

don't coach track,

everybody else the same,

modify some of Brittany's

second behind Keisha.

Candice, and Leah anchors.

with your second faster runner,

So, the gun sounds and I
decide to go right for the lead

749
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:12,365

is that both Strong

and those guys are
better than me.

tournament on my home course,

763
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,742

surrounding counties came in,

764
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:44,875

go before me and all
hit great drives.

So, I start getting worried.

768
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:54,233

shot I drive it 20 yards.

by 12 strokes

winning my three strokes.

776

I just saw a perfect race.

868
00:37:17,147 --> 00:37:19,802
Your best time is 3.9
seconds behind Keisha's.

869
00:37:19,976 --> 00:37:23,763
Now, in an 800 meter
race that's a long way.

Yeah, I know.

871
00:37:25,068 --> 00:37:26,766
So, we've got two tasks.

872
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,377
One, we've gotta get you
two to three seconds faster.

873
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:32,685
Two, we've gotta get Keisha
one to two seconds slower.

874
00:37:32,859 --> 00:37:34,295
What?

875
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:35,949
Our first task is
to get you faster.

876
00:37:36,123 --> 00:37:37,907
We're gonna change the
way you run your race.

877
00:37:38,081 --> 00:37:39,518
You're not gonna be going out
fast and then slowing down

878
00:37:39,692 --> 00:37:41,607
on your second lap the
way that you're used to.

879
00:37:41,781 --> 00:37:44,218
You're actually gonna be
doing the exact opposite.

880
00:37:44,392 --> 00:37:45,785
Secretariat is
the horse that won

881
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:48,788
the 1973 Kentucky
Derby in record time.

882
00:37:48,962 --> 00:37:50,746
The race is a mile
and a quarter long,

883
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:54,837
and each quarter mile he got
faster than the one before.

884
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:56,404
These are his splits.

885
00:37:56,578 --> 00:37:57,884
The science behind
running says you maximize

886
00:37:58,058 --> 00:38:00,321
your ability with
a 51 to 49% split.

887
00:38:00,495 --> 00:38:01,888
Meaning, starting out slower

888
00:38:02,062 --> 00:38:05,326
and getting slightly
faster as you go.

889
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,502
It's exactly what
Secretariat did,

890
00:38:07,676 --> 00:38:09,635
it's exactly what
you're gonna do.

891
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:12,028
All right, I want you to
run your first 100 meters

892
00:38:12,202 --> 00:38:16,032
in 16 seconds with 3/10ths
of a second on either side.

893
00:38:16,206 --> 00:38:17,904

to get the pacing down,

894
00:38:18,078 --> 00:38:19,384

about the rich young

have eternal life?

the ultimate question, right?

to have eternal life?

919

And you'll remember in the
story it says that he asked

920
00:39:57,569 --> 00:40:01,616
Jesus and Jesus told him,
he didn't like the answer,

921
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:05,403
so he walked away and the Bible
said that he was sorrowful.

and this is a big if,

Brittany can run a 2:06,

1647

how does Keisha
Thompson run a 2:06?

1648
01:16:42,119 --> 01:16:43,729
If Keisha goes out slower
than she normally does

1649
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:45,383
than Brittany has a chance.

1650
01:16:45,557 --> 01:16:48,038
Wait, I don't
understand, please explain.

1651
01:16:48,212 --> 01:16:50,301
Keisha usually goes
out in 60 seconds,

1652
01:16:50,475 --> 01:16:52,390
finishes the second lap in 65.

1653
01:16:52,564 --> 01:16:54,131
So, if she goes out
slower than she's used to,

1654
01:16:54,305 --> 01:16:55,306
then Brittany has a chance.

1655

How do you figure?

1656
01:16:57,134 --> 01:16:58,918
Because Keisha's body
is used to going out fast

1657
01:16:59,092 --> 01:17:01,138
and then slowing down and if
she goes out at a slower pace,

1658
01:17:01,312 --> 01:17:02,574
it's gonna do the same thing.

1659
01:17:02,748 --> 01:17:04,315
- What?
- If Keisha goes out slower

1660
01:17:04,489 --> 01:17:06,404
it's gonna be easy for
her to maintain that pace.

1661
01:17:06,578 --> 01:17:07,971

just turn on the jets

what she just did,

your heat today,

Do you remember the
story in the Bible

1790
01:22:14,886 --> 01:22:17,019
about the blind man Bartimaeus?

1791
01:22:17,193 --> 01:22:18,455
He was begging on
the side of the road

1792
01:22:18,629 --> 01:22:20,370
when he heard Jesus was coming.

1793
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:24,069
He said, Jesus son of
David, have mercy on me.

1794
01:22:24,243 --> 01:22:26,028
And Jesus called for him

1795
01:22:26,202 --> 01:22:29,161
and Bartimaeus cast
aside his garment

1796
01:22:29,335 --> 01:22:31,642
and Jesus asked
him what he wanted.

1797
01:22:31,816 --> 01:22:34,123
He said that he wanted to see.

1798
01:22:35,602 --> 01:22:37,909
Jesus said your faith
has made you whole

1799
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:41,652
and he immediately
received his sight.

1800
01:22:41,826 --> 01:22:43,480
Jesus said that his
faith made him whole,

1801
01:22:43,654 --> 01:22:47,092
but what faith was
he talking about?

1802
01:22:47,266 --> 01:22:49,312
A lot of people don't
know that in those days,

1803
01:22:49,486 --> 01:22:51,183
blind people wore
a special garment

1804
01:22:51,357 --> 01:22:53,664
so that other people would
know that they were blind.

1805
01:22:53,838 --> 01:22:56,275
So, when Bartimaeus cast it
aside it was his way of saying,

1806
01:22:56,449 --> 01:22:59,104
I'm not even gonna
need this anymore.

1807
01:22:59,278 --> 01:23:01,063
That's the faith.

was gonna heal him

did what she told me.

And then yesterday in our
heat at the national qualifier,

1819
01:23:33,878 --> 01:23:36,881
Coach Donnelly told Brittany
to stay with the leaders

1820
01:23:37,055 --> 01:23:40,580
and then win it at the
end, which she did.

1821

not here to complain

about Coach Donnelly, but
perhaps you can give us

1826
01:23:54,290 --> 01:23:55,900
some clear direction.

1827
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:59,773
I saw the regional
race and for 600 meters

1828
01:23:59,947 --> 01:24:01,645
Brittany was right with Keisha.

1829
01:24:01,819 --> 01:24:03,168
She looked great.

1830
01:24:03,342 --> 01:24:05,040
Yeah, she did.

1831
01:24:05,214 --> 01:24:06,171

the only way to run

01:24:06,345 --> 01:24:08,130
the final and have a chance.

1833
01:24:08,304 --> 01:24:10,610

out slower in the final.

1839
01:24:26,626 --> 01:24:29,064
Keisha's coach is gonna
slow her down for the final.

1840
01:24:29,238 --> 01:24:30,674
