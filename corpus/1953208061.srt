1
00:00:01,059 --> 00:00:05,024
The open plains of the asphalt jungle.

2
00:00:05,025 --> 00:00:08,061
Home to many creatures, great and small.

3
00:00:08,062 --> 00:00:13,025
And the pupping ground for one the
most clever and illustrious creatures,

4
00:00:13,026 --> 00:00:16,029
the Plastic Bag.

5
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:21,009
Today we explore the cycle of life for
this curious creature, the plastic bag

6
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:26,064
on it's migration to it's
home, the Pacific ocean.

7
00:00:26,065 --> 00:00:31,036
Once released into the wild, the
plastic bag is unsure of itself.

8
00:00:31,037 --> 00:00:36,094
It falters at first, but soon,
with some help from the wind,

9
00:00:36,095 --> 00:00:39,070
the bag will be airborne!

10
00:00:39,078 --> 00:00:42,058
This flight will be the
first in it's long

11
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,038
journey towards it's
final destination:

12
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:50,077
The Garbage Patch in heart
of the Pacific Ocean.

13
00:00:51,025 --> 00:00:53,045
Using the wind to guide it,

14
00:00:53,046 --> 00:00:56,055
the plastic bag moves across
the city, through the air.

15
00:00:57,065 --> 00:00:59,057
A city park.

16
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:04,006
This park may, at first, seem like an
idyllic place for the plastic bag,

17
00:01:04,015 --> 00:01:07,055
but danger lurks around every corner.

18
00:01:07,056 --> 00:01:10,005
Here it will encounter many enemies,

19
00:01:10,006 --> 00:01:11,588
including one of the MOST dangerous...

20
00:01:12,004 --> 00:01:14,059
Park Services!

21
00:01:18,075 --> 00:01:24,093
Poor little fellow. Looks
like HIS journey ends here.

22
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,548
Meanwhile, our little
bag has encountered

23
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:30,045
one of nature's most deadly killers...

24
00:01:30,046 --> 00:01:32,046
the Teacup Yorkie.

25
00:01:32,047 --> 00:01:34,537
Once the Yorkie has
locked onto his victim,

26
00:01:34,538 --> 00:01:37,027
there is very little
hope for survival.

27
00:01:37,028 --> 00:01:40,028
But using it's superior
size and deft maneuvering,

28
00:01:40,029 --> 00:01:47,029
our bag manages to escape the Yorkie's
talons and flee for it's life.

29
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:54,007
Over the course of it's
miraculous migration,

30
00:01:54,012 --> 00:01:56,077
the plastic bag will
cover VAST distances,

31
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:02,057
through neighborhoods, across
parks, and down city streets.

32
00:02:02,058 --> 00:02:06,028
It is now nightfall and our highly
advanced Night Vision Cameras

33
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:10,028
have managed to capture, for
the FIRST TIME in history,

34
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,084
a plastic bag in pitch black.

35
00:02:13,024 --> 00:02:16,048
PHENOMENAL!

36
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:23,049
The vast cement rivers of California,
home to literally dozens of animals.

37
00:02:24,046 --> 00:02:27,097
Many plastic bags will
not make it out of here,

38
00:02:27,098 --> 00:02:30,090
the reeds and branches will see to that.

39
00:02:33,013 --> 00:02:37,024
As at home in water as it
is on land or in the air,

40
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:43,024
the bag's natural buoyancy makes
it an excellent swimmer.

41
00:02:48,003 --> 00:02:49,019
It's close now...

42
00:02:49,028 --> 00:02:51,086
and it can feel it!

43
00:02:53,038 --> 00:02:59,036
At last the bag has reached
the gateway to the open sea.

44
00:02:59,582 --> 00:03:01,068
Careful to avoid the mouths of hungry

45
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:02,753
sea life that feed on
the helpless plastic,

46
00:03:04,085 --> 00:03:07,585
the bag will travel 100s
of miles, to join the

47
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:11,085
thriving community of
plastic known as...

48
00:03:12,046 --> 00:03:15,085
the GREAT PACIFIC GARBAGE PATCH.

49
00:03:15,086 --> 00:03:18,089
The Garbage Patch is a
veritable plastic oasis,

50
00:03:18,095 --> 00:03:22,041
where millions of tons of plastic
garbage remain trapped by the currents.

51
00:03:23,055 --> 00:03:25,041
It is said to be twice
the size of Texas,

52
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,023
never actually biodegrading,

53
00:03:27,024 --> 00:03:30,524
here the plastic bag can live
indefinitely, peacefully,

54
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:34,024
coexisting with billions of
other petroleum species,

55
00:03:35,062 --> 00:03:39,063
before breaking into ever
tinier plastic pieces,

56
00:03:39,064 --> 00:03:45,021
thus completing the
plastic cycle of life.
