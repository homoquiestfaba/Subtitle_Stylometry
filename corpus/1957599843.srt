00:18:03,334 --> 00:18:07,709
What? What will you
think of, Carlos?

359
00:18:07,709 --> 00:18:10,083
If we don't have 5000
dollars by next week,

360
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:13,167
the bank gets
everything.

361
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:16,083
We'll be out on
the street.

362
00:18:25,501 --> 00:18:27,709
The street!

363
00:18:28,626 --> 00:18:30,584
I'll think of something.

364
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,292
He doesn't like me?

365
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:41,167
What did I do?

366
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:44,667
Everybody likes me.

367
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:47,125
He's not gonna cut
you off is he?

368
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:50,918
This is the same shit he's
pulled on me for years.

369
00:18:50,918 --> 00:18:53,918
But this time,
I'm as serious as he is.

370
00:18:53,918 --> 00:18:56,125
And I've got him
right where I want him.

371
00:18:56,125 --> 00:19:00,918
Especially If could just
find the right idiot.

372
00:19:00,918 --> 00:19:03,751
- [tires screech]
- [horn honks]

373
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:05,918
Bloody Carlos!

374
00:19:05,918 --> 00:19:07,918
What a loser.

375
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,918
[Alexandra]
 It's going to work
 like a charm.

376
00:19:21,918 --> 00:19:23,709
[Carlos]
 Look I don't really
think so, you know.

377
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:24,959
I was waiting
 for this.

378
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:27,584
We get down here and already
 you're asking for more money
 .

379
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,334
Well, forget it.

380
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,417
Hey, look, it's not
about the money, OK?

381
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:32,334
Good.

382
00:19:32,334 --> 00:19:34,918
Then there's
nothing to discuss.

383
00:19:45,209 --> 00:19:47,334
[doorbell rings]

384
00:19:48,042 --> 00:19:50,751
Never mind Edison, I'll get it.

385
00:19:50,751 --> 00:19:53,083
It's Alexandra.

386
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,375
Hey, Mama!
What's happening?

387
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,292
Mother, I'd like you
to meet Carlos,

388
00:19:57,292 --> 00:19:58,918
my new fiancé.

389
00:19:58,918 --> 00:20:00,918
Hey, baby!
How you doing?

390
00:20:00,918 --> 00:20:03,918
Hey, I never seen you in the
daytime. Turn around, Mama.

391
00:20:03,918 --> 00:20:06,584
Come on! Whip it around!
Let me check it out.

392
00:20:06,584 --> 00:20:08,042
Whoo!

393
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:10,626
Now I see where Alex
gets that cute ass.

394
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,792
Ooh baby, shoot me a lippy.

395
00:20:14,792 --> 00:20:16,542
Swab my tonsils.

396
00:20:16,542 --> 00:20:17,501
Wow.

397
00:20:17,501 --> 00:20:19,250
Bad pad you got here.

398
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,459
Hey, is your man a dope
dealer or what?

399
00:20:21,459 --> 00:20:22,918
If he is, tell him
to whip it on out.

400
00:20:22,918 --> 00:20:24,584
Let's party man.
Call some chicks.

401
00:20:24,584 --> 00:20:26,209
Get on the horn,
get on the blower.

402
00:20:26,209 --> 00:20:27,626
Let's blow it out.

403
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,959
Hey dude, Carlos Muñoz,
glad to meet you, Holmes.

404
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:31,250
Delighted.

405
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,918
Yeah, right back at ya'.

406
00:20:32,918 --> 00:20:38,125
Ooh, baby! With these hands,
with these lips,
what I could do.

407
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,250
Ooh.

408
00:20:41,751 --> 00:20:42,918
Wow! Wow much this thing cost?

409
00:20:42,918 --> 00:20:46,083
[Irene] Be careful with it.
It's a Ming Dynasty vase.

410
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,918
Oh, I better be careful
with it or else. Oh, no!

411
00:20:48,918 --> 00:20:50,417
Oh!

412
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:52,792
Hey, Holmes, be careful
with that bag.

413
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:54,584
It's got all my
porno mags in it.

414
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:56,918
If You're good later, we'll let
you watch "Debbie Does Bondage."

415
00:20:56,918 --> 00:20:58,751
We've seen it a lot, huh?

416
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,584
Mm. OK baby, up the stairs.

417
00:21:00,584 --> 00:21:04,542
Time to get greased
and ready for action, huh?

418
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:06,292
Hello, baby.

419
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:08,042
Are you room service?

420
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:10,375
That's it? Walk right on by,
stuck up bitch.

421
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:13,667
I'm gonna make you wait and
crawl and beg,"Oh, Carlos!

422
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:16,125
Please, me next!
Please, please."

423
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,918
OK, I'll give you one more shot.

424
00:21:17,918 --> 00:21:18,918
Only if you're good.

425
00:21:18,918 --> 00:21:20,918
I mean really good.

426
00:21:20,918 --> 00:21:21,918
Thank you Edison.

427
00:21:21,918 --> 00:21:23,834
Ooh, Mama.

428
00:21:23,834 --> 00:21:25,459
Hey, thank you, Edison.
Good bloke, man.

429
00:21:25,459 --> 00:21:26,792
- Young man.
- Huh?

430
00:21:26,792 --> 00:21:29,125
The guest bedroom
is in the East wing.

431
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,792
- What? Yeah, yeah.
- The guest bedroom...

432
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:34,709
You want me to sleep in a
different room from my old lady?

433
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:36,918
Right. Shit.

434
00:21:36,918 --> 00:21:38,209
Oh, look at that bed.

435
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:41,417
It's like a playground.
Hold on baby, I'll
be right there.

436
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:42,709
Hey, tell you what.

437
00:21:42,709 --> 00:21:44,918
Make sure we get plenty of fresh
towels and don't bug us

438
00:21:44,918 --> 00:21:46,459
for at least an hour.
You know what I mean?

439
00:21:46,459 --> 00:21:47,918
I'm coming.

440
00:21:51,167 --> 00:21:52,959
Better make that
two hours, you know...

441
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:56,542
No slow, slow,
baby, take it off slow.

442
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:58,918
Daddy is coming.

443
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:00,584
- [thud]
- [Carlos] Hey, I gave
her a buck,

444
00:22:00,584 --> 00:22:02,834
you think that was too
much, babe?

445
00:22:04,918 --> 00:22:06,918
This is gonna be great.

446
00:22:08,167 --> 00:22:09,918
Was that OK?

447
00:22:09,918 --> 00:22:11,083
Let me get this straight.

448
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:12,918
All I gotta do is tell your
old man that you and me

449
00:22:12,918 --> 00:22:15,626
is getting married and
keep acting like
a total idiot, right?

450
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:18,918
That's it. Be the easiest
5000 dollars you ever made.

451
00:22:18,918 --> 00:22:21,959
Be the only 5000
I ever made.

452
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,876
God, being a kid
must've killed you, man.

453
00:22:25,876 --> 00:22:27,918
No wonder you don't
do anything now.

454
00:22:27,918 --> 00:22:32,042
Look at this skiing, horseback
riding, tennis, ballet.

455
00:22:32,042 --> 00:22:33,626
Ice skating.

456
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,751
I'm gonna go change.

457
00:22:36,751 --> 00:22:39,918
Oh yeah? What are you gonna
change into, a frog?

458
00:22:45,042 --> 00:22:46,501
[knock at door]

459
00:22:46,501 --> 00:22:48,250
Alex, you here?

460
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,000
- [Carlos] Oh.
- Sorry.

461
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,501
Oh, Alex is in the
bathroom freshening up.

462
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:58,042
I'm Maggie, Alex's
first cousin.

463
00:22:58,042 --> 00:22:59,918
Oh, hi.
Glad-
Oh-

464
00:23:00,918 --> 00:23:03,834
- I'm Carlos Muñoz.
- Muno-

465
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:05,959
Muñoz, right, right.
You got it.

466
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:07,042
Where's Bruce?

467
00:23:07,042 --> 00:23:08,167
Bruce?

468
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:11,000
Oh, he's outta here.
Father didn't approve.

469
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,459
He's gone. See ya.
History.

470
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:14,542
- Really?
- Yeah.

471
00:23:14,542 --> 00:23:16,417
So you are the...

472
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:19,918
Alex's latest.
And the greatest.

473
00:23:19,918 --> 00:23:21,918
How do you like me so far?

474
00:23:22,918 --> 00:23:24,209
I don't know you.

475
00:23:24,209 --> 00:23:25,834
How do you like me?

476
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:27,918
Oh. I don't know
you either.

477
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:32,751
You staying for
the weekend?

478
00:23:32,751 --> 00:23:34,167
Yeah. I was
thinking about it.

479
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:36,876
- How about you? Oh, good.
- Yeah.

480
00:23:36,876 --> 00:23:41,167
Maybe we'll get to
know each other.

481
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:43,584
Yeah, that'd be great.

482
00:23:43,584 --> 00:23:46,918
I think it could be.

483
00:23:46,918 --> 00:23:48,918
Bye.

484
00:23:49,501 --> 00:23:51,667
See ya.

485
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:52,918
Adios.

486
00:23:57,709 --> 00:23:59,751
What the hell was that?

487
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:12,792
If you want some lipstick,
you can borrow mine.

488
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:14,167
- Oh.
- It's in the bathroom.

489
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:18,209
- I was just, uh...
- And, by the way,

490
00:24:18,209 --> 00:24:20,083
so are you.

491
00:24:28,626 --> 00:24:31,959
[Carlos] Hey. way to go,
babe. Alright. Whoo!

492
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:33,417
Whoo!

493
00:24:33,417 --> 00:24:36,792
Hey, beats the hell out
of watching it on TV,
huh, Lady Irene?

494
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:38,876
You don't play tennis,
Carlos?

495
00:24:38,876 --> 00:24:41,167
Me? Right.

496
00:24:41,167 --> 00:24:43,375
See, where I come from you got
enough space to put a tennis

497
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:47,375
court on man, you got
3000 people living on it.

498
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:48,709
Yo! Hey, Jeeves.

499
00:24:48,709 --> 00:24:50,167
Jeeves.

500
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:52,042
Yo, what's that
dude's name again?

501
00:24:52,042 --> 00:24:53,584
- Edison.
- Edison, right.

502
00:24:53,584 --> 00:24:55,918
Yo, Edison.

503
00:24:55,918 --> 00:24:57,292
That's it.
Take your time, man.

504
00:24:57,292 --> 00:24:59,959
Is this dude dead or what?

505
00:24:59,959 --> 00:25:01,876
Hey thanks, bud.

506
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:03,417
There you go. Thank you.

507
00:25:03,417 --> 00:25:06,417
And next time don't
be bullshittin' with the
vodka either too, man.

508
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:07,959
Mm.

509
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:10,167
Hey, you played good babe.

510
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:12,375
I especially liked that
part where you bend over.

511
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:13,542
Woooo.

512
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:18,334
[man] G'day there sailors.

513
00:25:18,334 --> 00:25:21,167
Don't you ever
give up, Mother?

514
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:22,375
G'day Alexandra.

515
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:23,876
Fancy a quick one?

516
00:25:23,876 --> 00:25:25,375
Tennis, I mean.

517
00:25:29,459 --> 00:25:33,250
Oh, excuse me. I'm Carlos
Muñoz, man. That's my name.

518
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:36,918
I'm Alex's latest
squeeze, man.

519
00:25:36,918 --> 00:25:39,709
[laughs hard]

520
00:25:39,709 --> 00:25:41,542
You almost had me there.

521
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:44,626
Tennis anyone?

522
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:45,751
Oh, not me. I'm pooped.

523
00:25:45,751 --> 00:25:47,959
I just had three hard
sets with Daddy.

524
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:51,584
I don't suppose you play?

525
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:54,959
Me? Hey, why not?

526
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:56,876
I'll give it a bash.

527
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:01,834
Ok, let's try it.

528
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:04,876
Do I got any grill
work on my butt?

529
00:26:04,876 --> 00:26:06,167
Hey, can I borrow
your bat?

530
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:08,959
Thanks honey.
Woooo.

531
00:26:11,918 --> 00:26:13,959
[Carlos] All right.
Let's do it bro.

532
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:17,167
Take it easy on me man. I
haven't played since Wimbledon.

533
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:22,751
Yo, hello. Yo, hello.

534
00:26:22,751 --> 00:26:24,959
Hey dude, you got
another bat, man?

535
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,042
Yo!

536
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:30,167
OK, dude you ready?

All right. Play ball.

538
00:26:32,876 --> 00:26:35,209
Here we go.

539
00:26:35,209 --> 00:26:37,292
Oh, let's try it again.

Here we go.

541
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:48,959
Sorry. Was that a
foul ball or what?

542
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:55,626
[breathless] Yes, I'm
perfectly alright.

543
00:26:55,626 --> 00:26:58,751
Yes, perfectly alright.

544
00:27:00,501 --> 00:27:01,667
And, this is the study.

545

Excuse me, Sir Ian.
I'll get out of your way.

548
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,042
No, you're alright.
Go on with what
you were doing.

549
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:11,042
Don't mind us.

550
00:27:11,042 --> 00:27:13,083
Yeah, don't mind us.

551
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:15,459
Hey, it's a nice place
you got here, man.

552
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:18,626
Is this where you come to hide
out from the old lady?

553
00:27:18,626 --> 00:27:20,959
Hey dude, what's a place
like this cost, man?

554
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:23,209
We, uh, we don't
discuss such things.

555
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:24,626
Right.

556
00:27:24,626 --> 00:27:26,959
I've served rich people
all my life man.

557
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:29,375

[barks like a dog]

559
00:27:32,459 --> 00:27:34,959
Tasty man. How do you get
away with it, dude?

560
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:37,000
How do I get
away with what?

561
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,042
Hey, I guess the old lady don't
care no more, huh?
I'm with you, man,

562
00:27:40,042 --> 00:27:42,709

Hey, relax, Holmes.
I'm just teasing.

566
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:53,584
I wouldn't do it
with no maid, man.

567
00:27:53,584 --> 00:27:55,834
Unless Alex wanted
a threesome.

568
00:27:55,834 --> 00:27:57,542
And then, hallo.

569
00:27:58,959 --> 00:28:01,542
Wow, man, are you sure we
can find our way back to the
house from here?

570
00:28:01,542 --> 00:28:02,709
No problem.

571
00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:04,918
Maybe we should
call a cab, man.

572
00:28:04,918 --> 00:28:07,000
Your family here with
you in Australia?

573
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,542
Are you kidding man,
I dumped them losers
years ago.

574
00:28:09,542 --> 00:28:11,375
- Admirable.
- Yeah.

575
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:14,584
So is there anything
else you wanna know
about me, man?

576
00:28:14,584 --> 00:28:16,042
So you're just gonna
give me the OK?

577
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:17,375
The OK for what?

578
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:19,626
You know,
to marry Alex.

579
00:28:24,918 --> 00:28:27,292
Hey, how many slaves it
take to run this place, man?

580
00:28:27,292 --> 00:28:30,250
This was Alex's
favorite as a child.

581
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,083
That's great looks like
future dog food, man.

582
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:34,459
Yo, Alpo.

583
00:28:34,459 --> 00:28:35,959
- Hey, dude.
- Tell me.

584
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:38,125
How did you and Alex
get together?

585
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:40,959
Oh, hey you know what. Like
I felt sorry for the chick.

586
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:43,792
She was on the rebound.
So I said, "Hey, give the
chick a break."

587
00:28:43,792 --> 00:28:45,834
You know what I mean. You
know how chicks are like, man.

No, way. You know?
Like with Alex and me.

is like only half the trip, man.

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Hey, Pepe, I'd ask
you to cook us up
some refried beans,

704
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,918
but you probably
haven't got a work visa.

705
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,125
Who was that jerk?

706
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:48,250
He's my uncle.

707
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:51,417
He's married to my
father's sister.

708
00:34:51,417 --> 00:34:53,709
Bruce'll fit right
in with this family.

709
00:34:53,709 --> 00:34:55,125
That's your opinion.

710
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:57,626
Yeah well, at least
I got an opinion, you know.

711
00:34:57,626 --> 00:35:01,167
And when I want it,
I'll ask for it. OK?

712
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:07,334
Women.

713
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,626
Mexican.

714
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:16,000
Buenas noches, Señor.

715
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,167
Quiere bailar?

716
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:19,167
What?

717
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:20,834
Do you want to dance?

718
00:35:20,834 --> 00:35:23,000
Oh, yeah, sure.
Why not?

719
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,751
Aye muchacho!

720
00:35:25,584 --> 00:35:28,542
You know, I spent one
summer in Mexico

721
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:31,000
as an exchange student.

722
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,709
Oh, I just love
the Mexican people.

723
00:35:33,709 --> 00:35:36,626
So do I. I love'em
so much I had'em
for parents.

724
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,542
Muchacho!

725
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,542
He's working his way nicely
into the family, isn't he dear?

726
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:10,000
So what do you think
of me so far?

727
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:13,459
You're a really hip dancer.

728
00:36:13,459 --> 00:36:14,959
That's a good sign you know.

729
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:16,417
Oh, yeah.
Sign of what?

730
00:36:16,417 --> 00:36:19,751
Well, people who
are good at dancing
are usually good at...

731
00:36:23,584 --> 00:36:24,959
...other things.

732
00:36:24,959 --> 00:36:27,209
Your mother was
a bit worried
that you might be

733
00:36:27,209 --> 00:36:28,459
getting a bit
sweet on Pepe here.

734
00:36:28,459 --> 00:36:30,083
But I told her,
"No worries."

735
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:31,959
Because all those
jokers from down there

736
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:34,667
they're raving
homos anyway.

737
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:36,542
Daddy.

738
00:36:36,542 --> 00:36:38,000
Don't worry about it.

739
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,792
It's just a little myth
we put out to get rich

740
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:41,292
Australians to
come on down.

741
00:36:41,292 --> 00:36:42,584
Look here, Pepe.

742
00:36:42,584 --> 00:36:44,626
I bet you been to
Mexico haven't you.

743
00:36:44,626 --> 00:36:46,709
- Yeah.
- You like that
tequila, don't ya?

744
00:36:46,709 --> 00:36:50,000
- Yeah, it's alright.
- Yeah, you gotta watch
out for it though.

745
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,167
If you drink too much,
it has an awful punch.

746
00:36:57,334 --> 00:37:00,000
I think he had one of those
bad ribs, you know.

747
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,918
Must have been
something he ate.

748
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,751
Who the hell do
you think you are?

749
00:37:13,751 --> 00:37:15,459
My father
isn't an idiot.

750
00:37:15,459 --> 00:37:17,501
He knows I'd never be in love
with a common street fighter.

751
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:19,876
You could have blown
the whole damn thing.

752
00:37:19,876 --> 00:37:22,667
Look if anybody's blowing
the damn thing, it's you, babe.

753
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:23,626
I'm out of here.

754
00:37:23,626 --> 00:37:27,209
You are not bloody
out of here, mate.

755
00:37:27,209 --> 00:37:29,000
You can get a lot of
suckers to do this shit.

756
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,751
Just get yourself
another one, OK?

757
00:37:31,751 --> 00:37:34,459
I know I was supposed to
come down here to get Daddy
all pissed off

758
00:37:34,459 --> 00:37:36,250
so he'd say you
could marry Bruce.

759
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,501
I didn't come down
here to get shit on

760
00:37:37,501 --> 00:37:39,876
and insulted by these
bigoted assholes.

761
00:37:43,417 --> 00:37:47,417
A deal's a deal and so far
our little Alexandra's
come out on top.

762
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:49,167
What shall you do?

763
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:51,751
I still hold the last card.

764
00:37:51,751 --> 00:37:53,792
It's time to put it
on the table.

765
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,959
So you've changed your mind
about the five thousand dollars?

766
00:37:57,959 --> 00:37:59,250
Look how about this
for a new deal?

767
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:02,292
I get out of here, and you keep
the five grand. Okay? See ya.

768
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,250
There is no new deal.

769
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:10,125
You leave here with
the 5000 dollars
when I say.

770
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:14,042
And I won't be saying
anything until my father
says that I can marry Bruce.

771
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,042
Is that clear?

772
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,042
Forget it.

773
00:38:23,042 --> 00:38:25,209
All right, I'll double it.

774
00:38:25,209 --> 00:38:26,667
Another five thousand.

775
00:38:30,918 --> 00:38:32,250
Another five?

776
00:38:37,209 --> 00:38:39,042
May I come in?

777
00:38:40,334 --> 00:38:42,751
Carlos, I want to apologize.

778
00:38:42,751 --> 00:38:45,876
My brother-in-law
can be very insensitive.

779
00:38:45,876 --> 00:38:48,042
He's Australian, you see.

780
00:38:48,042 --> 00:38:51,125
When I told him that you and
Alexandra were getting married,

781
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:52,375
I said if he didn't like you

782
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:54,959
he needn't bother attending
any more family functions.

783
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:58,042
Uh, you mean you're
gonna let me marry her?

784
00:38:58,042 --> 00:39:00,709
You're gonna let
me marry him?

785
00:39:00,709 --> 00:39:03,542
Well, it's a little too
rapid for my taste sweetheart.

786
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:07,042
But... a deal's a deal.

787
00:39:07,042 --> 00:39:10,334
Welcome to the family.

788
00:39:10,334 --> 00:39:11,959
Son.

789
00:39:16,542 --> 00:39:17,918
Goodnight.

790
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:22,042
Goodnight, sweetheart.

791
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:39,751
Shut up. This isn't funny.

792
00:39:43,459 --> 00:39:44,792
What?

793
00:39:44,792 --> 00:39:46,959
Hey, what about a June
wedding, honey?

794
00:39:46,959 --> 00:39:49,209
I like June. You know,
not too hot, not too cold.

795
00:39:49,209 --> 00:39:51,167
What do you think,
sweetheart, June?

796
00:39:51,959 --> 00:39:53,751
I said shut up and get out.

797
00:39:55,959 --> 00:39:57,042
Get out!

798
00:39:57,042 --> 00:39:58,667
Oh, get out. OK.

799
00:39:58,667 --> 00:40:01,459
Get out!

800
00:40:01,459 --> 00:40:05,042
OK, OK. [hums wedding march]
Dun dun da dun.

801
00:40:05,042 --> 00:40:10,042
Dun Dun da Dun.
And 10,000 dollars to boot.

802
00:40:10,042 --> 00:40:12,042
Da dun dun da dun.

803
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:18,042
[horse neighs]

804
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:28,250
[Carlos humming
wedding march]

805
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,792
Oh, Carlos.

806
00:40:29,792 --> 00:40:30,459
Huh?

807
00:40:30,459 --> 00:40:32,959
- Oh, hi.
- Entrez.

808
00:40:36,792 --> 00:40:39,042
- How you doin?
- Sit down.

809
00:40:39,042 --> 00:40:40,417
Sit down.

810
00:40:46,334 --> 00:40:47,542
Well, did you
have a good time?

811
00:40:47,542 --> 00:40:50,959
Would you mind brushing
the back of my hair?

812
00:40:50,959 --> 00:40:52,501
I can't seem to reach it.

813
00:40:52,501 --> 00:40:54,250
Oh, yeah sure.

814
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56,042
Thank you.

815
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:01,501
- [snorting]
- Oh. I'm sorry.
Did I hurt you?

816
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:04,459
No no. Don't stop.
You won't hurt me.

817
00:41:08,209 --> 00:41:11,751
[snorting and blowing
like a horse] Harder.

818
00:41:11,751 --> 00:41:13,542
Harder?

819
00:41:13,542 --> 00:41:14,834
- [blows] Harder.
- Harder?

820
00:41:14,834 --> 00:41:16,042
Harder!

821
00:41:16,042 --> 00:41:19,709
[whinnies] Faster, faster.

822
00:41:22,626 --> 00:41:26,042
Harder, faster.

823
00:41:29,584 --> 00:41:32,000
- Say something
in Mexican.
- What?

824
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,083
Say something in Mexican.

825
00:41:34,042 --> 00:41:35,626
Quick.

826
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:37,167
La chica es loca.

827
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:46,042
- [neighs blows and whinnies]
- Is there a horse the house?

828
00:41:52,667 --> 00:41:54,042
- [snorting]
- If I take my hand off

829
00:41:54,042 --> 00:41:56,667
will you be quiet?

830
00:41:56,667 --> 00:41:58,501
You sure?

831
00:42:03,709 --> 00:42:05,584
I'm sorry.

832
00:42:05,584 --> 00:42:08,083
I don't know what
came over me.

833
00:42:08,083 --> 00:42:11,083
You scared the
hell out of me.

834
00:42:11,083 --> 00:42:12,667
Aye caramba!

835
00:42:12,667 --> 00:42:15,250
[shrieks] Yeah!
Viva Zapata!

836
00:42:18,042 --> 00:42:19,042
Hey, relax!

837
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:22,417
Calm down.

838
00:42:26,042 --> 00:42:27,042
I'm Mexi...

839
00:42:27,042 --> 00:42:28,751
I mean, I'm not Mexican.

840
00:42:28,751 --> 00:42:30,292
Oh, look, a kangaroo.

841
00:42:32,709 --> 00:42:35,375
- [making loud snorting noises]
- We can talk about this.

842
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:36,751
Let's make a deal.

843
00:42:37,959 --> 00:42:40,042
No. no!

844
00:42:40,292 --> 00:42:41,834
Oh, dear.

845
00:42:41,834 --> 00:42:44,209
Maggie's having those
horse nightmares again.

846
00:42:51,125 --> 00:42:53,584
[Maggie squealing and snorting]

847
00:43:00,751 --> 00:43:03,042
Jump my little jumping bean.

848
00:43:21,042 --> 00:43:23,459
Eh.

849
00:43:25,083 --> 00:43:27,792
Whoa, what a ride!

850
00:43:27,792 --> 00:43:29,375
All right babe,
you're next.

851
00:43:29,375 --> 00:43:30,792
I'm oiled up.

852
00:43:31,459 --> 00:43:34,834
My! What a
strange young man.

853
00:43:34,834 --> 00:43:36,375
Not for this family.

854
00:43:36,792 --> 00:43:38,042
[whimpers]

855
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,209
[Carlos singing]

856
00:43:50,209 --> 00:43:52,584
Hey, top of the
morning, Jeeves.

857
00:43:52,584 --> 00:43:53,542
Hey, good morning,
everybody.

858
00:43:53,542 --> 00:43:55,042
Hey, babe.

859
00:43:55,042 --> 00:43:56,542
I'm surprised you're up.

860
00:43:56,542 --> 00:43:58,042
I'm surprised
you could walk.

861
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:00,792
I managed.

862
00:44:00,792 --> 00:44:04,083
Tell me have you two
settled on a date yet?

863
00:44:04,083 --> 00:44:05,501
We'll let you know.

864
00:44:05,501 --> 00:44:08,584
You could give us a hint,
couldn't you Alexandra?

865
00:44:08,584 --> 00:44:10,751
I'm usually free
in the afternoons.

866
00:44:12,209 --> 00:44:15,375
You know, Carlos, I'd be
delighted to take you
into the business.

867
00:44:15,375 --> 00:44:16,292
Who me?

868
00:44:16,292 --> 00:44:19,042
Nah, I'm not into
business, man.

869
00:44:19,042 --> 00:44:20,834
Well, you're quick.
You're good with people.

870
00:44:20,834 --> 00:44:23,042
I think you'd be great.
Don't you darling?

871
00:44:24,042 --> 00:44:25,667
Nah, I don't think so.

872
00:44:25,667 --> 00:44:28,042
Hey, tell you what.
You know who'd be
great at business?

873
00:44:28,042 --> 00:44:30,125
Your daughter, man.
She drives a mean bargain.

874
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:32,083
Mm, I've been telling
her for years.

875
00:44:33,709 --> 00:44:36,375
Do you think you could
talk some sense into her?

876
00:44:36,375 --> 00:44:38,000
Who me?

877
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,626
Yeah. No problem.

[sniffs]

879
00:44:44,959 --> 00:44:46,042
Pew.

880
00:44:47,125 --> 00:44:49,584
Well, if we're going to
beat the Sunday traffic,

881
00:44:49,584 --> 00:44:51,459
better hit the road.

882
00:44:51,459 --> 00:44:53,876
Hmm?
Oh...

883
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:58,042
Well, it's been
a slice.

884
00:44:58,042 --> 00:44:58,959
Uh, leave them.

885
00:44:58,959 --> 00:45:00,501
Edison will
take care of it.

886
00:45:00,501 --> 00:45:02,459
Where I come from everybody
does their own dishes,

887
00:45:02,459 --> 00:45:03,417
you know what I mean?

888
00:45:03,417 --> 00:45:06,042
Travel broadens the
horizons. Leave it.

889
00:45:06,042 --> 00:45:08,083
It'll just take five minutes.

890
00:45:08,083 --> 00:45:11,083
I said leave them.

891
00:45:16,083 --> 00:45:18,417
Well, see you
in the Spring,

892
00:45:18,417 --> 00:45:20,751
if we don't see
you in the mattress.

893
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:22,167
Later on.

894
00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:23,918
Cheerio, Jeeves.

895
00:45:37,626 --> 00:45:39,876
Incredible performance.

896
00:45:39,876 --> 00:45:42,626
I wonder what she'll
come up with for act three.

897
00:45:42,626 --> 00:45:47,083
She must really be in love to
put up with all this nonsense.

898
00:45:47,083 --> 00:45:49,751
Perhaps we should just
let her marry him.

899
00:45:49,751 --> 00:45:52,709
Likeable fellow,
this Carlos.

900
00:45:52,709 --> 00:45:55,501
I meant Bruce,
not Carlos.

901
00:45:56,959 --> 00:45:59,250
Let's just play along
a bit longer.

902
00:46:05,292 --> 00:46:07,918
Hey listen, uh, I don't
really have a bank account.

903
00:46:07,918 --> 00:46:09,834
You think I can get
the money in cash?

904
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:11,083
What money?

905
00:46:11,083 --> 00:46:12,083
What do you mean,
what money?

906
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:13,209
The ten grand.

907
00:46:13,209 --> 00:46:14,375
Are you kidding?

908
00:46:14,375 --> 00:46:17,083
Oh, come on. You're
not gonna stiff me are ya?

909
00:46:17,083 --> 00:46:19,083
You said you didn't
want the money.

910
00:46:19,083 --> 00:46:21,209
'Cause I wanted to quit,
but you made me stay.

911
00:46:21,209 --> 00:46:23,083
Dear God, don't you
understand anything?

912
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:25,584
I wanted you to stay
so father would hate you.

913
00:46:25,584 --> 00:46:29,375
Instead you sit around like old
mates, talking about my career.

914
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:32,626
Hey, I did everything
I could to make him
think I was a jerk.

915
00:46:32,626 --> 00:46:34,751
And look what happened,
he loves you.

916
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,125
It's not my fault.

917
00:46:36,125 --> 00:46:37,834
He's only human.

918
00:46:37,834 --> 00:46:39,250
Put it this way.

919
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:41,751
I go to your restaurant
and order a meal.

920
00:46:41,751 --> 00:46:43,918
You go to the kitchen, but you
come back without the food.

921
00:46:43,918 --> 00:46:45,292
Do you still think I should pay?

922
00:46:45,292 --> 00:46:47,584
What the hell
does that mean?

923
00:46:56,292 --> 00:46:57,459
Hey, where are we goin'?

924
00:46:57,459 --> 00:46:59,042
We're going through Walingatta.

925
00:46:59,042 --> 00:47:02,501
I want to surprise Bruce at the
hotel. We'll stay the night.

926
00:47:02,501 --> 00:47:04,459
Stay the night?

927
00:47:04,459 --> 00:47:05,667
If you don't want to sleep over,

928
00:47:05,667 --> 00:47:09,083
you can get the bus
back to Sydney.

929
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:11,083
Yeah, cool whatever.

930
00:47:24,083 --> 00:47:26,125
Hey, they could use some help.
Why didn't you stop?

931
00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:27,959
It's a trick.

932
00:47:27,959 --> 00:47:29,751
What are you talking about?

933
00:47:29,751 --> 00:47:33,083
They get you to stop
and then they rob you blind.

934
00:47:34,125 --> 00:47:36,709
I can't believe you.

935
00:47:36,709 --> 00:47:39,417
Hey, you'd stop if it
was a Rolls wouldn't you?

936
00:47:39,417 --> 00:47:41,417
Or maybe a Mercedes
or a Jaguar?

937
00:47:41,417 --> 00:47:44,209
Alright. You've made
your point.

938
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:02,667
Hey, dude.

939
00:48:03,834 --> 00:48:04,792
G'day, mate.

940
00:48:04,792 --> 00:48:06,375
- How ya doin'?
- You got any water?

941
00:48:07,792 --> 00:48:08,918
Yeah, here's some.

942
00:48:08,918 --> 00:48:11,083
Go ahead.
Have at it.

943
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:22,083
I'm gonna give'em a hand.

944
00:48:24,542 --> 00:48:26,918
Don't tell me, let me guess.
A flat tire?

945
00:48:26,918 --> 00:48:28,083
You're right.

946
00:48:28,083 --> 00:48:29,876
I was going to take the
spare in and get it fixed,

947
00:48:29,876 --> 00:48:33,083
but I didn't have the cash,
so I took a chance.

948
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:34,792
Bad luck, huh.

949
00:48:34,792 --> 00:48:36,459
Well, what can
we do for ya?

950
00:48:36,459 --> 00:48:37,876
Don't know.

951
00:48:37,876 --> 00:48:40,042
can't all fit in the
back of your car.

952
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:42,083
That'd be a little crowded.

953
00:48:42,083 --> 00:48:43,501
Uh, hm.

954
00:48:43,501 --> 00:48:46,042
Tell you what.
Give me a hand.

955
00:48:46,042 --> 00:48:47,542
Let's have a look.

956
00:48:47,542 --> 00:48:49,375
I'll just throw
this on the ground.

957
00:48:55,083 --> 00:48:56,292
What do you think?

958
00:48:56,292 --> 00:48:57,209
Yeah?

959
00:48:57,209 --> 00:48:58,125
Hope it's enough
to rock and roll.

960
00:48:58,125 --> 00:49:01,083
- She's a beauty.
- Yeah.

961
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,083
Uh, hello.
It's my tire.

962
00:49:04,083 --> 00:49:06,083
Oh, don't worry.
You'll get it back.

963
00:49:09,125 --> 00:49:11,834
I have somewhere to go.

964
00:49:11,834 --> 00:49:13,083
Hey, good idea.

965
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:15,083
Why don't you go down
there and take a walk?

966
00:49:15,083 --> 00:49:16,042
What a beautiful day.

967
00:49:16,042 --> 00:49:18,876
Yeah, take a nice
long walk. Okay?

968
00:49:18,876 --> 00:49:20,459
Eh, nature.

969
00:49:20,459 --> 00:49:22,083
I'll be right with ya.

970
00:49:25,083 --> 00:49:26,334
Where you come from, mate?

971
00:49:26,334 --> 00:49:28,250
Me? Uh, L.A.

972
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:29,334
How about you?

973
00:49:29,334 --> 00:49:32,584
Whyalla. What are you
doing over here?

974
00:49:32,584 --> 00:49:35,125
Oh, well it wasn't
working out in L.A.

975
00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:37,542
so I thought I'd give
this place a try you know?

976
00:49:37,542 --> 00:49:39,125
What made you
pick Australia?

977
00:49:41,459 --> 00:49:44,542
Tell you the truth I
kept seeing this guy on TV.

978
00:49:44,542 --> 00:49:46,751
He was saying "G'day, mate."

979
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,542
Throw another
shrimp on the barbie.

980
00:49:48,542 --> 00:49:50,083
Sitting there drinking a
beer... beautiful beach.

981
00:49:50,083 --> 00:49:52,626
I thought hey,
could be worse.

982
00:49:54,083 --> 00:49:57,501
Lately I've been thinking
that I'm the shrimp on
the barbie though.

983
00:49:57,501 --> 00:50:00,709
It looks like you've
done alright for
yourself so far mate.

984
00:50:02,584 --> 00:50:05,667
Isn't that right honey,
could be worse?
What do you think?

985
00:50:05,667 --> 00:50:07,459
Having a good time, huh?

986
00:50:07,459 --> 00:50:09,083
How 'bout we get some
land over here, huh?

987
00:50:09,083 --> 00:50:11,083
Maybe we raise some
kids, some sheep.

988
00:50:11,083 --> 00:50:13,083
Put a little house up
there. What do you think?

989
00:50:13,083 --> 00:50:17,083
You two remind me of me
and the missus when we
was first hitched.

990
00:50:17,083 --> 00:50:18,542
Bloody lovebirds we was.

991
00:50:18,542 --> 00:50:20,834
Couldn't keep our eyes
off each other.

992
00:50:20,834 --> 00:50:23,083
I know what you mean.

993
00:50:23,083 --> 00:50:27,751
Thank you pretty lady.

and good luck charm.

995

Oh, that's really
beautiful, huh?

997
00:50:37,083 --> 00:50:38,501
Say "thank you" now.

998
00:50:40,709 --> 00:50:42,042
Thank you.

999
00:50:56,584 --> 00:50:59,083

up the time you wasted playing

1001
00:51:01,083 --> 00:51:03,209
I can't believe you
gave my tire away.

1002
00:51:03,209 --> 00:51:04,792
Do you know how
much that's worth?

1003
00:51:04,792 --> 00:51:08,000
What are you talking about,
gave it away? I didn't
give it away.

1004
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,083
He was gonna bring it back.

1005
00:51:09,083 --> 00:51:11,959
You just wouldn't give
him your address.

1006
00:51:11,959 --> 00:51:14,125
Hey, besides, he gave
you that beautiful crystal.

1007
00:51:15,334 --> 00:51:17,292
This piece of junk.

1008
00:51:21,667 --> 00:51:24,417
At least I only lose a
100 dollar tire this way.

1009
00:51:24,417 --> 00:51:26,083
Say what?

1010
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,792
If I gave them my address,

1011
00:51:27,792 --> 00:51:30,959
I'd come home tomorrow
to an empty apartment.

1012
00:51:30,959 --> 00:51:33,584
Oh come on,
that guy was OK.

1013
00:51:33,584 --> 00:51:35,125
You gotta
trust somebody.

1014
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:38,501
It's easy to trust people when
you don't have anything to lose.

That is really great.

1020

What are we gonna do now,
Mr. Einstein?

1021
00:52:06,542 --> 00:52:07,751
I don't know.

1022
00:52:07,751 --> 00:52:09,959
I'll tell you what
we're gonna do.

1023

belts anymore, that's for sure.

to me like that.

1051
00:54:07,083 --> 00:54:08,918
Give me that light.

1052
00:54:08,918 --> 00:54:11,375
Fine. I won't say
a word to you.

1053
00:54:11,375 --> 00:54:14,125
Just look for some wood
so we don't freeze to death.

1054
00:54:17,125 --> 00:54:19,375
That's right, be a smartass.

1055
00:54:19,375 --> 00:54:23,250
You're the one who got us
stranded out here anyway.

1056
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:25,584
God, I'm freezing.

1057
00:54:27,459 --> 00:54:32,125
Probably wild animals all around
here... waiting to attack us.

1058
00:54:32,834 --> 00:54:34,125
Are you listening to me?

1059
00:54:34,125 --> 00:54:36,125
- Yeah.
- [both scream]

1060
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:38,209
[Carlos] Oh, Jesus.

1061
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:43,292
Hey, it's a big
piece of wood.

1062
00:54:43,292 --> 00:54:45,125
Help me to get it out
of the ground.

1063
00:54:45,125 --> 00:54:47,083
I'm not helping
you do anything.

1064
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:51,042
Oh fine, then freeze to
death by yourself, Jesus.

1065
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:57,125
Alright. What do you
want me to do?

1066
00:55:00,501 --> 00:55:03,667
[laughter]

1067
00:55:05,125 --> 00:55:07,542
You know she told me
so much about you that you

1068
00:55:07,542 --> 00:55:10,501
should blush every time
I walk in the room.

1069
00:55:13,125 --> 00:55:16,709
Yeah, and just
what have you heard?

1070
00:55:16,709 --> 00:55:21,501
Oh, I heard about your
incredible horizontal talent.

1071
00:55:24,501 --> 00:55:26,334
At least she wasn't
telling lies.

1072
00:55:26,334 --> 00:55:30,667
Ah ah ah ah. Where I come
from, seeing is believing.

1073
00:55:31,918 --> 00:55:33,459
You like Jacuzzi?

1074
00:55:34,792 --> 00:55:36,626
Hmm?

1075
00:55:36,626 --> 00:55:39,125
Jacuzzi. Jac-uzzi!

1076
00:55:40,125 --> 00:55:42,792
[Alex] Race you back!
[Carlos] Hey, get back here.

1077
00:55:44,125 --> 00:55:46,000
[both laugh]

1078
00:55:48,876 --> 00:55:50,292
I just let you win
'cause you're a chick.

1079
00:55:50,292 --> 00:55:52,042
Oh, right.

1080
00:55:52,042 --> 00:55:54,584
I'll have you know I was
track champion at my school.

1081
00:55:54,584 --> 00:55:57,417
Oh, yeah?
Well, bully for you.

1082
00:55:57,417 --> 00:55:59,584
[frog and cricket sounds]

1083
00:56:05,584 --> 00:56:10,542
So, what are you doin' later
after the fire dies down?

1084
00:56:10,542 --> 00:56:14,083
Down boy. You're
not my type.

1085
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:16,792
Oh, yeah.

1086
00:56:16,792 --> 00:56:20,125
I forgot you like the rocket
scientist type like Bruce.

1087
00:56:21,959 --> 00:56:24,209
He's not so bad.

1088
00:56:24,209 --> 00:56:26,375
[chuckles] Yeah, right.

1089
00:56:29,459 --> 00:56:31,125
What's so funny?

1090
00:56:31,125 --> 00:56:33,125
Oh, nothing.

1091
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:34,250
No, what's so funny?

1092
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:37,167
I was just curious,

1093
00:56:37,167 --> 00:56:40,167
what do you guys talk
about when you're alone?

1094
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:41,834
Is it like,

1095
00:56:41,834 --> 00:56:45,417
Hey Bruce, how do you
breathe out of your nose
after a rugby match?

1096
00:56:45,417 --> 00:56:47,417
Or something like that?

1097
00:56:47,417 --> 00:56:49,542
You wouldn't understand.

1098
00:56:49,542 --> 00:56:52,042
"You wouldn't understand"?

1099
00:56:52,042 --> 00:56:53,792
Is that your answer
for everything?

1100
00:56:56,125 --> 00:56:57,501
What do you mean?

1101
00:56:57,501 --> 00:57:00,792
Well, you say it to
me all the time.

1102
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,751
Look, I might not be
the smartest guy in the world,

1103
00:57:02,751 --> 00:57:05,667
but I'm not the dumbest.

1104
00:57:05,667 --> 00:57:08,125
What's there to
not understand?

1105
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:10,334
Your daddy dangles
you on a string.

1106
00:57:10,334 --> 00:57:12,125
It pisses you off.

1107
00:57:12,125 --> 00:57:14,918
You just don't have enough
nerve to cut the string.

1108
00:57:14,918 --> 00:57:16,417
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1109
00:57:16,417 --> 00:57:17,959
Right.

1110
00:57:17,959 --> 00:57:23,167
I mean like the car and
the condo and the boutique.

1111
00:57:23,167 --> 00:57:26,792
Hey, look I may not have much,
but what I have, is my own.

1112
00:57:26,792 --> 00:57:28,501
And I don't have to marry Bruce.

1113
00:57:32,125 --> 00:57:37,125
Oh, I know, "You wouldn't
understand." Jeez.

1114
00:57:51,959 --> 00:57:54,125
[sniffles]

1115
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,501
Nobody comes up here.

1116
00:58:25,501 --> 00:58:27,125
He said it was on the roof.

1117
00:58:27,125 --> 00:58:29,209
I mean, he said it was
upstairs, not on the roof.

1118
00:58:29,209 --> 00:58:30,626
Are you sure we're in
the right place?

1119
00:58:30,626 --> 00:58:33,042
No worries, love.

1120
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:35,959
When Brucie says,
"This is the place."

1121
00:58:35,959 --> 00:58:38,000
This is it.

1122
00:58:41,125 --> 00:58:44,792
[both] More champagne.

1123
00:58:57,167 --> 00:58:59,751
Just get'em off.

1124
00:59:04,167 --> 00:59:07,167
[seductive tune]
Da da da da da

1125
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:13,375
Come on, baby.
Take it off.

1126
00:59:16,918 --> 00:59:19,167
[Dominique]
Da da da da da dum.

1127
00:59:19,667 --> 00:59:21,876
Ba da da da da

1128
00:59:24,125 --> 00:59:26,167
Do do do do do

1129
00:59:28,167 --> 00:59:31,292
Yeah. Oh, come on.

1130
00:59:33,209 --> 00:59:36,959
[continues singing]

1131
00:59:46,459 --> 00:59:48,918
[Bruce] Come on to papa.

1132
00:59:55,501 --> 00:59:57,125
Yeah, baby.

1133
01:00:04,542 --> 01:00:06,125
Oh, yeah, baby.

1134
01:00:27,751 --> 01:00:29,959
You want to make your
fantasies come true?

1135
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:32,167
Aw, yeah.

1136
01:00:32,167 --> 01:00:35,626
Ah ah ah. First you have
to take off those

1137
01:00:35,626 --> 01:00:38,667
ridiculous shorts.

1138
01:00:38,667 --> 01:00:39,959
[ Bruce laughs]

1139
01:00:39,959 --> 01:00:41,918
- Yeah.
- Alors.

1140
01:01:04,042 --> 01:01:06,167
[man] What are they doing
in the fish tank?

1141
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:12,167
[laughter]

1142
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:27,501
Round of drinks
on the house.

1143
01:01:27,501 --> 01:01:30,167
[crowd cheering]

1144
01:01:47,125 --> 01:01:51,834
So, what you gonna
do with your 10,000 dollars?

1145
01:01:51,834 --> 01:01:54,542
You're gonna give me
the money after all?

1146
01:01:54,542 --> 01:01:56,876
Why not?
You tried your best.

1147
01:01:56,876 --> 01:01:58,918
It's only money.

1148
01:01:58,918 --> 01:02:01,167
Yeah, it's only money.

1149
01:02:01,167 --> 01:02:03,792
How about 50,000?

1150
01:02:03,792 --> 01:02:05,626
Very funny.

1151
01:02:05,626 --> 01:02:10,125
No, you'll get your money as
soon as we get back to Sydney.

1152
01:02:10,125 --> 01:02:13,167
Then I'll probably never
see you again.

1153
01:02:13,167 --> 01:02:16,292
Yeah,that's right.

1154
01:02:16,292 --> 01:02:18,167
That's right.

1155
01:02:22,167 --> 01:02:24,167
Hey listen, before I
never see you again,

1156
01:02:24,167 --> 01:02:26,334
you think maybe
I can get an advance?

1157
01:02:26,334 --> 01:02:29,125
Get something to eat
and get the bus home.

1158
01:02:29,125 --> 01:02:31,167
Sure, no problem.

1159
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:33,167
Great.

1160
01:02:44,918 --> 01:02:46,876
Thank you for calling.
Bye-bye.

1161
01:02:46,876 --> 01:02:48,834
Has Mr. Bruce Woodley
checked in yet?

1162
01:02:48,834 --> 01:02:52,167
I believe Mr. Woodley
is here ma'am.

1163
01:02:52,167 --> 01:02:54,250
Could I have his
room number, please?

1164
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:56,584
Can I ask
who's enquiring?

1165
01:02:56,584 --> 01:02:59,292
I'm Alexandra Hobart,
Mr. Woodley's fiancée.

1166
01:02:59,292 --> 01:03:01,334
[burst of laughter]

1167
01:03:01,334 --> 01:03:05,167
- It's, Room 212.
- [more laughter]

1168
01:03:05,167 --> 01:03:08,167
Let me tell Mr. Woodley
you're here.

1169
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:13,626
Yeah?

1170
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:16,125
Shit!

1171
01:03:18,626 --> 01:03:20,918
Yeah, when's the next
bus to Sydney?

1172
01:03:20,918 --> 01:03:22,501
Not till tomorrow.

1173
01:03:22,501 --> 01:03:25,501
You're gonna have
to stay the night.

1174
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:26,709
Yeah, looks like it.

1175
01:03:26,709 --> 01:03:28,250
You got a single?

1176
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:31,584
Yes, if you just
sign here, please, sir.

1177
01:03:31,584 --> 01:03:33,501
And, there's your room.

1178
01:03:33,501 --> 01:03:35,751
- I'm gonna go freshen up.
- OK.

1179
01:03:35,751 --> 01:03:37,375
I'll check on you later.

1180
01:03:38,792 --> 01:03:42,167
It's just down the hall, and
it's the first on the right.

1181
01:03:42,167 --> 01:03:43,042
Thanks a lot.

1182
01:03:43,042 --> 01:03:45,000
- Enjoy your stay.
- Yep.

1183
01:03:52,125 --> 01:03:54,167
Bye bye, guys.

1184
01:03:54,167 --> 01:03:55,751
Carlos,

1185
01:03:55,751 --> 01:03:57,250
what are you doing here?

1186
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:00,167
Just looking for my room.

1187
01:04:00,167 --> 01:04:03,000
You, didn't see
anything, right?

1188
01:04:04,834 --> 01:04:06,042
Right.

1189
01:04:06,501 --> 01:04:08,876
Hey, hey, Carlos, mate.

1190
01:04:08,876 --> 01:04:10,542
Listen, I'll, I'll
do you right.

1191
01:04:10,542 --> 01:04:11,918
Okay?

1192
01:04:11,918 --> 01:04:16,167
Uh, how about 1,000 bucks to
sort of cloud the mind? OK?

1193
01:04:16,167 --> 01:04:17,834
What's wrong with you people,
man?

1194
01:04:17,834 --> 01:04:20,000
Think money can buy everything?

1195
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,876
Hey! Listen, dickhead.

1196
01:04:21,876 --> 01:04:23,834
I'm on the pig's back.

1197
01:04:23,834 --> 01:04:25,792
Now I'm set for life.

1198
01:04:28,375 --> 01:04:30,626
Hey.
Come on,

1199
01:04:30,626 --> 01:04:33,167
you're not gonna
drop me in the shit?

1200
01:04:33,167 --> 01:04:36,167
I didn't drop you in anything,
man. You dropped yourself in it.

1201
01:04:36,167 --> 01:04:38,375
You know what?
That's where you belong.

1202
01:04:42,083 --> 01:04:43,584
Nice one.

1203
01:04:51,167 --> 01:04:52,709
You got the message sport?

1204
01:04:52,709 --> 01:04:53,876
You got it?

1205
01:04:53,876 --> 01:04:54,792
[shutter clicking]

1206
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:57,709
Ahh.

1207
01:05:38,125 --> 01:05:39,417
Darling.

1208
01:05:39,417 --> 01:05:41,667
You don't know how much
I've missed you.

1209
01:05:41,667 --> 01:05:43,292
Come on, come on.

1210
01:05:55,042 --> 01:05:57,209
I just want to say good
morning to Carlos.

1211
01:05:57,209 --> 01:05:58,459
I won't be long.

1212
01:05:58,459 --> 01:06:00,375
Uh, look.

1213
01:06:00,375 --> 01:06:02,209
I'll meet you
on the court, OK?

1214
01:06:02,209 --> 01:06:03,751
Here.

1215
01:06:07,292 --> 01:06:09,042
Carlos?

1216
01:06:10,209 --> 01:06:11,667
Carlos.

1217
01:06:19,209 --> 01:06:22,501
I'm sorry, Miss Hobart.
He checked out.

1218
01:06:22,501 --> 01:06:23,876
He could be at the bus stop.

1219
01:06:23,876 --> 01:06:25,083
Where is that?

1220
01:06:25,083 --> 01:06:26,709
It's right across
the road, ma'am.

1221
01:06:26,709 --> 01:06:28,417
Thank you.

1222
01:06:43,417 --> 01:06:45,417
Carlos?

1223
01:06:46,667 --> 01:06:49,667
My God!
What happened?

1224
01:06:49,667 --> 01:06:52,209
Guess I wasn't looking
where I was going.

1225
01:06:52,209 --> 01:06:54,209
Shit happens, you know?

1226
01:06:59,417 --> 01:07:00,959
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

1227
01:07:00,959 --> 01:07:03,209
I'm fine.
Don't worry about it.

1228
01:07:05,876 --> 01:07:08,209
So where are
you going anyway?

1229
01:07:08,209 --> 01:07:10,083
Home, I guess.

1230
01:07:19,542 --> 01:07:21,250
Yeah.

1231
01:07:27,417 --> 01:07:29,209
Will I see you
back in Sydney, then?

1232
01:07:29,209 --> 01:07:31,751
You know,
to give you the money...

1233
01:07:31,751 --> 01:07:33,459
That's OK.
You keep it.

1234
01:07:33,459 --> 01:07:36,209
What do you mean?
We had a deal.

1235
01:07:37,167 --> 01:07:39,250
Forget the deal.
You keep the money.

1236
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:41,542
You need it a lot
more than I do.

1237
01:07:41,542 --> 01:07:43,334
Good luck.

1238
01:08:12,375 --> 01:08:14,334
You think he
will be surprised?

1239
01:08:14,334 --> 01:08:16,459
He has no idea.

1240
01:08:16,459 --> 01:08:18,626
He thinks I don't even know
when his birthday is.

1241
01:08:18,626 --> 01:08:20,584
The other day when
 I walked home from work

1242
01:08:20,584 --> 01:08:22,334
I had a sudden
 call of nature.

1243
01:08:22,334 --> 01:08:24,959
I dropped into the nearest
 possible pit stop

1244
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:27,083
theMañanarestaurant.

1245
01:08:27,083 --> 01:08:29,334
When I walked out of the loo,
 the waiter presented me

1246
01:08:29,334 --> 01:08:33,167
with a first class margarita
 and a plate of hors
 d'oeuvres.

1247
01:08:33,167 --> 01:08:35,209
When I explained I didn't
have the cash to pay for
 them,

1248
01:08:35,209 --> 01:08:36,334
That's the same jerk
we saw in the restaurant.

1249
01:08:36,334 --> 01:08:38,292
he said, "Don't worry.
It's on the house."

1250
01:08:38,292 --> 01:08:41,584
Three starsMañana.It's not
 often you find a place

1251
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:43,209
where you can
 empty the old bladder

1252
01:08:43,209 --> 01:08:47,083
and on the same spot get a
 refill free and on the
 house.

1253
01:08:47,083 --> 01:08:50,584
I wanted to introduce this
 waiter, Carlos Muñoz,

1254
01:08:50,584 --> 01:08:53,792
but unfortunately,
 he's gone walkabout
 over the last two days.

1255
01:08:53,792 --> 01:08:55,417
But all is not lost.

1256
01:08:55,417 --> 01:08:58,209
One of his mates at the
restaurant had this to say.

1257
01:08:58,209 --> 01:09:02,209
Carlos, Carlos, if you're out
 there, I really need you.

1258
01:09:02,209 --> 01:09:04,250
I really need you to keep
 the restaurant going.

1259
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:05,292
Please.

1260
01:09:05,292 --> 01:09:07,709
Please, Carlos,
 come back. I'm sorry.

1261
01:09:07,709 --> 01:09:09,209
I'm sorry. Please.

1262
01:09:09,209 --> 01:09:11,209
[crying]

1263
01:09:11,209 --> 01:09:13,417
Well...

1264
01:09:15,167 --> 01:09:16,042
What was Carlos Muñoz
doing there?

1265
01:09:16,042 --> 01:09:17,876
Being nice. That's what.

1266
01:09:17,876 --> 01:09:20,501
If you go toMañana,
say,"G'day" to Carlos

1267
01:09:20,501 --> 01:09:21,334
when he gets back.

1268
01:09:21,334 --> 01:09:23,167
He's worth it.
 This is Gary...

1269
01:09:23,167 --> 01:09:24,292
Allez, allez,Alex.
Don't forget Bruce's party.

1270
01:09:24,292 --> 01:09:26,667
...don't forget,
it pays to be nice.

1271
01:09:26,667 --> 01:09:28,042
Over to you, Tony.

1272
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:33,209
Alex, what's the matter?
What's wrong?

1273
01:09:47,375 --> 01:09:48,918
That'll be all, gentlemen.

1274
01:09:57,292 --> 01:09:59,792
Your father's
right in here, Miss.

1275
01:09:59,792 --> 01:10:01,042
Thanks.

1276
01:10:01,042 --> 01:10:02,542
Well, Alexandra.

1277
01:10:02,542 --> 01:10:05,250
And to what do I owe the
pleasure of this
unexpected visit?

1278
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:06,751
Well, I was just
in the neighborhood

1279
01:10:06,751 --> 01:10:10,209
and I thought I would
stop by and see
how you were doing.

1280
01:10:11,584 --> 01:10:13,209
Very thoughtful.

1281
01:10:14,876 --> 01:10:16,417
So, how are you doing?

1282
01:10:16,417 --> 01:10:17,375
Never better.

1283
01:10:17,375 --> 01:10:18,918
And you?

1284
01:10:19,918 --> 01:10:21,501
I'm great.

1285
01:10:21,501 --> 01:10:23,209
Everything is great.

1286
01:10:24,209 --> 01:10:25,209
That bad, eh?

1287
01:10:25,209 --> 01:10:27,584
No, it's fine.
Really.

1288
01:10:28,751 --> 01:10:30,083
How's Carlos?

1289
01:10:31,584 --> 01:10:33,459
Carlos...

1290
01:10:33,459 --> 01:10:36,918
As a matter of fact,
that didn't work out.

1291
01:10:36,918 --> 01:10:39,042
Pity. Nice chap.

1292
01:10:39,042 --> 01:10:41,626
Your mother will be
disappointed.

1293
01:10:41,626 --> 01:10:44,626
Are you 100 percent set on
marrying this Bruce character?

1294
01:10:44,626 --> 01:10:46,501
Yes, I am.

1295
01:10:46,501 --> 01:10:47,876
Then what's wrong?

1296
01:10:47,876 --> 01:10:49,250
Nothing.

1297
01:10:51,083 --> 01:10:52,125
Now you're set on marrying him,

1298
01:10:52,125 --> 01:10:54,042
you're having
second thoughts, aren't you?

1299
01:10:54,042 --> 01:10:56,250
No, not at all.

1300
01:10:56,250 --> 01:10:57,375
Well...

1301
01:10:59,083 --> 01:11:02,000
You know how I feel about him.

1302
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,584
And as your father Alexandra,
just your plain, old dad,

1303
01:11:07,584 --> 01:11:10,667
if you ever want to change
your mind, it's not too late.

1304
01:11:22,209 --> 01:11:26,959
I haven't seen you cry like this
since you were a little girl.

1305
01:11:26,959 --> 01:11:30,751
It's just everything
all at once.

1306
01:11:46,125 --> 01:11:50,167
I've been like a kid.
Like a rebellious teenager.

1307
01:11:51,709 --> 01:11:54,292
I just wanted to beat
you at something, you know?

1308
01:11:54,292 --> 01:11:58,626
Make you say yes,
when I knew you'd say, no.

1309
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,209
I'm sorry.

1310
01:12:03,209 --> 01:12:07,751
I had no idea things were
so bad between you and me.

1311
01:12:07,751 --> 01:12:11,792
I'm really very
sorry about that.

1312
01:12:16,626 --> 01:12:20,209
I don't remember the last time
you said, "I'm sorry."

1313
01:12:20,209 --> 01:12:23,125
I don't remember
the last time I was wrong.

1314
01:12:31,542 --> 01:12:34,709
I don't think I want to spend
the rest of my life with Bruce.

1315
01:12:35,501 --> 01:12:37,709
Would you like me
to talk to him?

1316
01:12:37,709 --> 01:12:40,209
Let him down gently.

1317
01:12:42,501 --> 01:12:46,459
No, this time I'm
going to clean up my own mess.

1318
01:12:49,334 --> 01:12:52,209
I'm throwing him
a surprise party tonight

1319
01:12:52,209 --> 01:12:55,334
but afterwards...

1320
01:13:03,459 --> 01:13:05,042
You're a love.

1321
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:11,250
Oh, Alex, just a second.

1322
01:13:12,334 --> 01:13:13,876
Collins, still out there?

1323
01:13:13,876 --> 01:13:14,834
Yes, Sir Ian.

1324
01:13:14,834 --> 01:13:16,125
Have him bring
that envelope please.

1325
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:17,334
Thank you.

1326
01:13:17,334 --> 01:13:21,209
Mr. Collins is a photographer.
He took some snapshots for me.

1327
01:13:21,209 --> 01:13:24,083
Thank you, Collins. You'll be
quite interested in these, dear.

1328
01:13:24,083 --> 01:13:25,250
What are they?

1329
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:26,501
Fish.

1330
01:13:26,501 --> 01:13:28,626
Fish?

1331
01:13:28,626 --> 01:13:31,375
Most unusual fish.

1332
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:39,292
[all] Surprise.

1333
01:13:41,709 --> 01:13:44,250
You little devil.
You remembered.

1334
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:46,667
Oh, you haven't seen
anything yet.

1335
01:13:48,083 --> 01:13:49,250
Happy Birthday.

1336
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:52,334
[party chatter]

1337
01:13:56,292 --> 01:13:58,709
Ok, attention everyone.

1338
01:13:58,709 --> 01:14:01,250
We have a special event.

1339
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:04,250
Everyone find a seat on the
floor, doesn't matter where.

1340
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:09,042
And Bruce, darling.
Right here. Place of honor.

1341
01:14:11,375 --> 01:14:13,584
Drink for you.

1342
01:14:13,584 --> 01:14:16,083
You know, I was thinking.

1343
01:14:16,083 --> 01:14:19,250
What does one give to a man
who has everything?

1344
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:20,626
[man] A shot of penicillin?

1345
01:14:20,626 --> 01:14:21,959
[all laugh]

1346
01:14:21,959 --> 01:14:23,751
[man] Good one.

1347
01:14:23,751 --> 01:14:28,375
So, I've prepared a little
history of our time together.

1348
01:14:29,542 --> 01:14:32,250
Dominique, would you
get the lights please?

1349
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:40,083
Gstaad, where we first met.

1350
01:14:42,042 --> 01:14:44,250
[Alex] Love at first sight.

1351
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:46,250
Our first date.

1352
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:51,709
Bruce, always the salesman.

1353
01:14:51,709 --> 01:14:53,417
Four X would be proud.

1354
01:14:58,250 --> 01:15:00,375
[man] Uh oh, busted.

1355
01:15:04,751 --> 01:15:08,292
A real man's man.

1356
01:15:16,042 --> 01:15:20,083
I don't know where this is,
must have been another holiday.

1357
01:15:21,375 --> 01:15:22,751
Where is this?

1358
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:24,709
Dominique, I don't remember when
you came on holiday with us.

1359
01:15:24,709 --> 01:15:25,918
When was that?

1360
01:15:31,167 --> 01:15:33,375
Where is this?

1361
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:36,375
I don't even
remember being there.

1362
01:15:54,709 --> 01:15:56,250
What's this?

1363
01:15:56,250 --> 01:16:01,250
This is my best friend
and my fiancée.

1364
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:05,667
And she's leaving his room,
putting her clothes on.

1365
01:16:05,667 --> 01:16:07,918
I'm shocked.

1366
01:16:11,918 --> 01:16:14,584
And, how did
Carlos get here?

1367
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:24,792
Ooh. Carlos must have made
Bruce very mad.

1368
01:16:24,792 --> 01:16:26,250
Darling, let me explain...

1369
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:29,334
There's no need to explain.

1370
01:16:29,334 --> 01:16:32,250
A picture is worth
a thousand words.

1371
01:16:35,918 --> 01:16:38,250
I think we've seen enough.

1372
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:39,375
Lights.

1373
01:16:42,042 --> 01:16:44,834
Dominique, leaving so soon?

1374
01:16:44,834 --> 01:16:47,000
You haven't even had any
cake yet.

1375
01:16:50,375 --> 01:16:52,250
Good, isn't it?

1376
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:54,459
Alex, possum, let me explain.

1377
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:59,542
That's for Carlos.

1378
01:16:59,542 --> 01:17:01,667
Well, goodnight everyone.

1379
01:17:01,667 --> 01:17:04,667
I had a wonderful time.

1380
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:14,000
Sydney to Los Angeles, one-way?

1381
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,083
Yeah.

1382
01:17:41,918 --> 01:17:43,584
[angry crowd noise]

1383
01:17:43,584 --> 01:17:46,250
Me bladder's killing me.
I need to take a leak.

1384
01:17:48,959 --> 01:17:50,584
Where do we get the free beer?

1385
01:17:52,292 --> 01:17:53,876
It's been a nightmare.

1386
01:17:53,876 --> 01:17:55,250
Ever since that news clip
came on,

1387
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:57,250
I've been mobbed by freeloaders.

1388
01:17:57,250 --> 01:17:58,250
We're worse off than before.

1389
01:17:58,250 --> 01:17:59,667
Oh, Carlos!

1390
01:17:59,667 --> 01:18:02,250
Where is he?
Where is he?

1391
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:05,626
Vanished into thin air
right when I needed him most.

1392
01:18:05,626 --> 01:18:07,501
Señorita, help me, please.

1393
01:18:07,501 --> 01:18:12,000
Look at this mob. All they want
is the loo and free drinks.

1394
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,250
Wayne, Wayne!
It's OK.

1395
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:15,584
We'll find him.

1396
01:18:15,584 --> 01:18:19,125
Now, where do you think
he could have gone?

1397
01:18:19,125 --> 01:18:22,250
For all I know, he's probably
half-way to Mexico by now.

1398
01:18:28,959 --> 01:18:33,334
Flight 101 leaves Sydney
airport in 40 minutes.

1399
01:18:33,334 --> 01:18:34,626
Thanks.

1401
01:19:41,834 --> 01:19:43,209
Attention all passengers,

1402
01:19:43,209 --> 01:19:47,209
Flight 101 for Los Angeles
 now boarding at gate eight

1403
01:20:11,417 --> 01:20:13,709
Has flight 101 left yet?

1404
01:20:13,709 --> 01:20:15,959
That's it just
taxiing out to the runway.

1405
01:20:15,959 --> 01:20:17,417
Well, you have to stop it.

1406
01:20:17,417 --> 01:20:19,542
Sorry madam, I can't do that.

1407
01:20:20,667 --> 01:20:21,834
Sorry.

1408
01:20:56,959 --> 01:20:58,417
Hello, darling.

1409
01:21:00,792 --> 01:21:02,417
What are you doing here?

1410
01:21:02,417 --> 01:21:04,834
Same thing you are.

1411
01:21:04,834 --> 01:21:06,751
Don't want him
to leave either.

1412
01:21:06,751 --> 01:21:10,334
It's too late anyway.
Plane's already pulling away.

1413
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:22,417
I want you to stop that plane.

1414
01:21:22,417 --> 01:21:23,959
Right, governor.

1415
01:21:27,292 --> 01:21:28,876
It's alright, Dad.

1416
01:21:28,876 --> 01:21:30,709
I guess it just
wasn't meant to be.

1417
01:21:30,709 --> 01:21:32,459
We'll see about that.

1418
01:21:38,209 --> 01:21:39,250
Quantas Airlines.

1419
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:40,292
I want to talk to the Chairman.

1420
01:21:40,292 --> 01:21:42,292
Just a second,
 I'll connect you.

1421
01:21:42,292 --> 01:21:44,042
Mr. Adams' office.

1422
01:21:44,042 --> 01:21:45,626
I would like to speak
with Mr. Adams.

1423
01:21:45,626 --> 01:21:48,042
I'm sorry, sir.
 He's in a meeting.

1424
01:21:48,042 --> 01:21:50,209
Yes, tell him
Mr. Ian Hobart's here.

1425
01:21:51,918 --> 01:21:54,083
Sam, hi.

1426
01:21:54,083 --> 01:21:55,918
Yes.

1427
01:21:55,918 --> 01:21:57,751
We have a flight.

1428
01:21:57,751 --> 01:21:59,501
101.

1429
01:22:00,584 --> 01:22:02,459
Bring it back, could you?

1430
01:22:08,417 --> 01:22:11,292
I'm very rich.

1431
01:22:34,292 --> 01:22:36,918
The guy at the counter said
the ticket was cool.

1432
01:22:36,918 --> 01:22:39,626
He said it was
OK to go back to L.A., man.

1433
01:22:39,626 --> 01:22:41,417
I don't know what's the problem.

1434
01:22:41,417 --> 01:22:42,792
Was it the smoke detector?

1435
01:22:42,792 --> 01:22:46,292
I just opened the door and the
smoke detector went off, man.
