1
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,120
1099 A.D. It was an age
of religious Crusades and Holy Wars.

2
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,960
After a grueling
four-year campaign...

3
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,840
the Knights of Christendom finally
arrived at the gates of Jerusalem.

4
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,720
During the furious battle
for the Holy City...

5
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,600
a Flemish Knight,
Charles Le Vaillant...

6
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,440
had a life-changing epiphany.

7
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,720
Le Vaillant was struck
by the hypocrisy of killing...

8
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,560
fellow human beings
in the name of religion...

9
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,400
especially since these people
professed belief in the same god.

10
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,280
The Fazar,
Le Vaillant's written account...

11
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,200
of his experiences
in the Holy Land...

12
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,080
tells us he wandered the streets
of conquered Jerusalem...

13
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,920
for days after that bloody battle...

14
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,800
until he found the entrance
of a cave...

15
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,680
that ran beneath the length
of the Holy City.

16
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,520
Inside that cave, he began
to record his epiphany...

17
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,400
which became the basis
for a new religious sect...

18
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,280
an order that would combine
the fundamental tenets...

19
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,160
of the three major religious
of his day.

20
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,040
His first converts were
fellow Christian knights...

21
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,880
who'd also become disenchanted
by the bloodshed.

22
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,760
The force of his convictions
even won over...

23
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,600
a number of Muslims and Jews,
former enemies...

24
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,440
who now became willing converts
to the new faith.

25
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,320
Many years after completing
the original Fazar...

26
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,200
Le Vaillant had further revelations.

27
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,040
He wrote these down, intending them
to be added as the final chapter.

28
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,880
Around the same time,
he and his followers...

29
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,720
were being accused of heresy
by the Crusader authorities.

30
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,600
On their way to Syria,
he and a group of disciples...

31
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,440
were intercepted by some
of the very same Crusaders...

32
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,280
he had once commanded.

33
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,880
During the battle that followed...

34
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,720
Le Vaillant died a martyr's death.

35
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,160
The final chapter he had written
was lost.

36
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,480
Do you have the alarm code?
And no guards, right?

37
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,360
You will be like the fox
in the hen house.

38
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,240
Take as many eggs as you like.

39
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,080
Yuri, it's Russian mob.
No mistakes on this one, right?

40
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,960
My friend, this is 1,000 percent.

41
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,840
By this time tomorrow, you'll be
in New York making the deal.

42
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,680
A sale. And I'll be in Tel Aviv
waiting for my commission.

43
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,240
Visual is all clear.

44
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,680
- Come on.
- Done.

45
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,040
Way to go, Yuri. I'm in.

46
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,560
Do you see the egg?

47
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,480
It's beautiful.

48
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,400
Yes! Yes!

49
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,240
I'm going for it.

50
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,440
- I got it.
- Yuri's the man with the plan!

51
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,280
- You're the man with the plan.
- I told you.

52
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,120
- Shit.
- Rudy.

53
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,840
Are you okay?

54
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,640
- Was that a gunshot?
- No. I farted.

55
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,000
Guide me out of here.

56
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,160
Oh, shit. Rudy, I'm sorry.

57
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,440
Toilet.

58
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,680
Hey, pal, this is a taxi zone.
You want to get towed away?

59
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,520
Sorry. Watch it for me.

60
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,400
- Thanks.
- Right on.

61
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,240
Ladies and gentlemen, perhaps you've
seen enough stones and carvings.

62
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,120
All right, come with me.
I will now show you a garment.

63
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,960
One of our most controversial
acquisitions.

64
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,840
This was unearthed beneath
a false storage room...

65
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,680
situated by Theodosius
as a decoy against thieves.

66
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,560
Quite often, success
as an archaeologist...

67
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,480
depends on knowing where to dig.

68
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,360
Well, I can dig her.

69
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,240
Rudy! Would you
take over for me, please?

70
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,080
- Can I have your...
- Okay, everybody, follow me.

71
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,960
Dad, what's up? My main man!

72
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,880
Why must you always
attract attention?

73
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,760
Come on. I love people.
I love life.

74
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,600
You love to embarrass me.

75
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,480
I'm just having fun, Dad.

76
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,400
Anyway, you called me.
Want to talk?

77
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,320
Yes, but not here. Come on.

78
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,160
So tell me, Rudy, are you still
involved with that same nonsense?

79
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,960
Hey, I'm legit now.
Straight, import/ export.

80
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,800
And I'm kicking ass.
Now, check this out.

81
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,600
Here, take it. For you.

82
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,440
Fancy watches,
fast cars, easy money.

83
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,280
What does it all really prove
in the grand scheme of things?

84
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,120
- Yeah?
- You have the egg?

85
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,960
Yeah, I've got it. Trust me,
it's in pristine condition.

86
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,800
- 10:00.
- Yeah, I'll be there.

87
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,680
Later. Tonight. Some business.

88
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,600
I do hope, for your sake,
it is legal.

89
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,440
- A thousand percent.
- Come on.

90
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,240
Damn plane tickets.
They are here somewhere.

91
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,120
Where are you going?
Another dig?

92
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,960
No. An interview with someone
I've been trying to meet...

93
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,800
for a very long time.

94
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,640
- Don't touch that!
- Sorry.

95
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,560
What is it?

96
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,400
The lost chapter of the Fazar.

97
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,320
Oh.

98
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,200
The Fazar happens to be
the holy scripture...

99
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,080
for an obscure Middle Eastern sect.

100
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,960
And yes, to answer your
inevitable next question...

101
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,880
it is quite valuable.

102
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,760
But only to practicing members
of the Order.

103
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,600
What can I say, Dad?
You have an exciting life.

104
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,520
Rudy, we need to discuss
some important issues.

105
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,400
Can you come by my apartment
this evening?

106
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,280
I've got some business tonight.

107
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,120
In fact, it's time to go, Dad.

108
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,000
All right.
Can you at least call me?

109
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,880
Of course.

110
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,840
Absolutely.

111
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,720
Tonight.
Rudy, it has to be tonight.

112
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,560
You've got it, Dad.

113
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,800
Be careful.

114
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,600
- What's going on?
- What's up?

115
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,320
Mr. Cafmeyer, this way, please.

116
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,160
So, let's see
what Santa brought for me.

117
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,000
This egg was designed
by Peter Carl Faberge.

118
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,840
A special gift to Czar Nikolay.

119
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,680
Look at that inlay...
2 4-carat gold.

120
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,560
What can I say?
One of a kind.

121
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,440
- That's why it's so damn expensive.
- Yeah.

122
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,320
- You cannot find this on the Net.
- That's for sure.

123
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,160
But stealing it from
a Russian Mafia boss. Come on.

124
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,000
Russian Mafia?

125
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,920
In fact, he's got some friends...

126
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,840
very nasty guys.

127
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,720
If they found out about this...

128
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,560
you'd end up with your balls
stuffed and sewn inside your mouth.

129
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,400
So, the deal about the...

130
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,280
Here's the deal, Rudy.
I'm giving you an easy out.

131
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,120
I'll take this hot potato off your
hands, and I'll assume the risk.

132
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,960
Risk is my business, okay?

133
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,840
You're not listening, Rudy.

134
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,680
A second, please.

135
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,600
- Hello?
- Rudy, where are you?

136
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,440
You promised to call me tonight.

137
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,400
I'm in a business meeting.

138
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,280
Really? What,
are you buying a disco?

139
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,120
- Dad, please.
- I can hear that Snoopy Dogg music.

140
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,040
Where are you going?

141
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,880
Well, that is just what
I am trying to explain to you.

142
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,640
- What is going on?
- Give it to him.

143
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,360
Hey, come here!

144
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,760
My egg.

145
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,520
Move!

146
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,800
Move it!

147
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,560
Oh, shit.

148
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,200
My eyes!

149
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,040
Got a problem here?

150
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,800
Hey, can I make a phone call
over here?

151
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,640
Not just yet, Rudy. I heard
you had a big night last night.

152
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,480
How are you gonna pay for it?
Sell your Ferrari?

153
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,360
I had a bad night, okay?

154
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,240
Why do I have to look
at your face in the morning?

155
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,080
Is your father Oscar Cafmeyer?

156
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,960
Yeah. Why?

157
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,880
Yesterday, there was a valuable
manuscript in this case.

158
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,720
Last night, Security
discovered it missing.

159
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,680
So what?

160
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,560
Your father was the last one
to leave the building.

161
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,440
This morning, nobody seems
to know where he is.

162
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,360
Maybe it's a case
of "like father, like son"?

163
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,240
- You're full of shit!
- Rudy, relax.

164
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,120
Why should he break the glass
if he had a key?

165
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,000
Nobody's making
any accusations here.

166
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,920
We just want to ask him
some questions.

167
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,760
Do you know where he is?

168
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,800
Rudy, I have been trying
your mobile.

169
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,680
All I get is this recording.

170
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,520
Oh, never mind.
I will try again later.

171
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,320
Rudy, I am staying
at an old friend's home.

172
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,160
You remember Walt Finley.
He is teaching at Ben-Gurion University.

173
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,000
Now, this is his number.
97 2...

174
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,680
- Dad, how are you?
- Thank God you are there.

175
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,600
- Where are you?
- Israel.

176
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,480
- Israel!
- Pay attention, please.

177
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,360
Listen, I was just
at the police station.

178
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,240
- Do you know what they're saying?
- Not now, Rudy.

179
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,120
I'm afraid I might have gotten
myself into some big trouble.

180
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,080
What do you mean?

181
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,960
What are you doing?

182
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,880
Who's that?

183
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,760
Can you book me on the first flight
to Israel, Tel Aviv?

184
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,600
Right away.

185
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,240
Take your glasses off, please.

186
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,040
Visiting Israel
on business or pleasure?

187
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,960
Pleasure. Always.

188
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,800
Excuse me.
What's the delay?

189
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,600
Mr. Cafmeyer, our database shows
that you've had several arrests...

190
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,520
for illegally transporting
artifacts.

191
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,360
Does it also show
I was never convicted?

192
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,160
Please open your carry-on.

193
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,840
Do you have any artifacts
which you have not declared?

194
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,760
Oh. The Mona Lisa.

195
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,680
You like to joke, huh?

196
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,600
They say laughter
opens up the soul.

197
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,480
Well, while we're at it, let it
open the rest of your luggage too.

198
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,320
You're joking, right?

199
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,080
- You know, this is bullshit.
- No, Mr. Cafmeyer.

200
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,920
This is Israel.

201
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,600
I apologize for the inconvenience.
Security is extra tight this month.

202
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,440
Muslims are making their pilgrimage
to Jerusalem for Ramadan.

203
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,280
- Passport, please.
- Rudy Cafmeyer!

204
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,200
- Who is this?
- Walter Finley.

205
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,080
Professor of archeology
at Ben-Gurion University.

206
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,960
And what is your relationship
to this man?

207
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,840
Not that it's
any of your business.

208
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,760
I'm a friend of his father's.

209
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,680
I've known that kid
since he was in knickers...

210
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,520
which would have put you
in diapers.

211
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,360
Now, are there any more
insurmountable obstacles...

212
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,200
we have to overcome here,
young lady?

213
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,040
Thank you for your cooperation.

214
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,920
Shalom.

215
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,760
- Good to see you, Rudy.
- Good to see you too.

216
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,600
- Where's my dad?
- Let's get your bags into my car.

217
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,960
- Watch where you go, putz!
- Up yours!

218
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,760
Cafmeyer's a cranky old fool.

219
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,640
Calls me two days ago
to pick him up at the airport.

220
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,480
So I take him back to my house.
We have dinner, talk, catch up.

221
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,360
- What was he doing here?
- I'm getting to that.

222
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,200
What is this,
the Spanish Inquisition?

223
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,040
A few years ago, he uncovered some
scrolls near the Syrian border.

224
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,920
They were the lost final chapter
of the Fazar...

225
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,840
written by Le Vaillant himself.

226
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,760
What was he doing?
Translating it?

227
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,600
More than that. He was writing
a history of the sect.

228
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,480
An unauthorized history.

229
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,360
He's been E-mailing me
his chapters...

230
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,240
having me lock them up
in a safe deposit box here.

231
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,080
- Why a safe deposit box in Israel?
- Because he trusted me.

232
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,880
Here's the key.
You ought to have it anyway.

233
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,800
Okay, where can I find these guys?

234
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,640
I'll show you.

235
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,680
Their monastery
is in East Jerusalem...

236
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,560
the other side
of the Mount of Olives.

237
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,520
We're wasting time. Let's go.

238
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,360
The present-day Order is just
as reclusive as it ever was.

239
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,240
Fanatically adverse to publicity.

240
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,160
No contact with the outside world.

241
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,000
You'd do better trying to get
an audience with the Pope.

242
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,920
Son of a bitch.
Those are the guys...

243
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,840
that came by the house
and picked up your dad.

244
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,760
- Hey, you!
- Let's go!

245
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,600
- Jump in. I'll drive.
- You don't know the way!

246
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,480
You'll navigate.

247
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,320
Be careful.
This is a classic car.

248
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,760
Professor, buckle up.

249
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,880
Get down!

250
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,480
Watch the truck!

251
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,840
My car!

252
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,200
Shit.

253
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,040
Sorry about the car.

254
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,560
- There they are.
- Let's nail these sons of bitches.

255
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,920
You okay?

256
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,760
- I'm fine.
- Good.

257
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,440
Where's my father,
you son of a bitch?

258
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,000
I'm gonna kill you!

259
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,720
- You okay?
- Finley, look out!

260
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,080
- Don't move!
- He needs a doctor. Help me!

261
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,920
- Hey, it's not me!
- Get up!

262
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,640
You are telling us...

263
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,560
these men kidnapped your father?

264
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,480
They took him somewhere,
and no one's heard from him.

265
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,320
Mr. Cafmeyer, I can smell
bullshit a mile away.

266
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,160
And you're only five feet from me.

267
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,040
I believe you are using the alleged
disappearance of your father...

268
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,920
as a cover to smuggle artifacts
out of Israel.

269
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,880
Alleged?

270
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,760
My father was here,
and now he's missing!

271
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,600
That has nothing to do with
the reason you are now in custody.

272
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,480
You were found next to the corpse
of a prominent professor.

273
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,320
Let me guess. Now you
are accusing me of killing him?

274
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,160
Until we have more facts,
all options are open.

275
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,000
I'm placing you under house arrest.
You'll be taken to a hotel...

276
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,880
where you will remain until
we complete our investigation...

277
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,760
into the professor's death.

278
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,680
Know why you're smelling bullshit?

279
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,520
Because you're
up to your nose in it.

280
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,080
I'll be in the room next door
if you need anything.

281
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,920
- What about a taxi?
- Within reason.

282
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,680
- And what about my father?
- We are looking into the matter.

283
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,600
- Good night.
- Good night, officer.

284
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,440
Lieutenant Barr. Dalia Barr.

285
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,840
Thank you.

286
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,680
- How are you?
- Okay.

287
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:57,520
Thanks.

288
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,840
Go!

289
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,520
Rudy, let me explain
what happened in Odessa.

290
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,400
Explain what? You left me hanging
like a piece of laundry.

291
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,320
But, Rudy, there was this cop...

292
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,160
Admit it, you little slimeball,
or you'll never see your money.

293
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,040
- What money?
- The egg. I sold it.

294
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,920
Remember our deal? Ten percent?

295
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,800
That's 50 G's for you, my friend.

296
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,680
Lucky for you, this place
makes me feel very generous.

297
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,520
Thank you.

298
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,400
Rudy, do you have
the cash with you?

299
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,280
No. It's under my mattress.

300
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,160
Of course I have it.
But I'm leaving tonight.

301
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,040
Tonight?

302
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,920
Can we meet first? Please come
to my office in Tel Aviv.

303
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,760
I have a beautiful new penthouse
suite in the diamond district.

304
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,600
You'll be my special guest.

305
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,440
We'd like to use the phone.

306
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,200
I have a much better idea.

307
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,320
Is that you, Rudy?

308
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,640
You slimeball!
You almost got me killed.

309
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,480
Rudy, it wasn't my fault.

310
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,400
- You owe me.
- Owe you?

311
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,320
- You owe me.
- What do you mean?

312
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,160
- You owe me, I said.
- Anything, Rudy. Anything.

313
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,960
Just listen.
Tell me what I can do to help.

314
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,800
I need this map translated.
Can you do it?

315
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,680
- Sure?
- Sure. I'm positive.

316
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,560
I promise, friend.
What are you talking about?

317
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,440
- And this disk printed.
- Done. Anything for you.

318
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,320
Understand something.
I know where you sleep...

319
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,200
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
There were cops over there!

320
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,040
Cops. Let's split up.
I'll call you. Go.

321
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,440
Stop!

322
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,240
Oh, you maniac.

323
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,640
Look! There he is! Stop!

324
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,480
You! Hey, you! Stop!

325
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,200
Get away! Hey, stop!

326
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,640
Hey, you! Stop!

327
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,480
Stop!

328
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,440
Come on!

329
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,440
Don't move!

330
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,800
Freeze!

331
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,760
We got him! Nobody move!

332
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,520
Excuse me.

333
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:29,200
Cuff him!

334
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,880
Do you know how much trouble I'm in
because of you?

335
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,760
Let's have a coffee
and talk about it.

336
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,600
Well, Mr. Cafmeyer, you have proved
that my original hunch was correct.

337
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,520
You cannot be trusted.

338
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,400
I came here to look for my father.

339
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,280
I did what I had to do because
nobody else seems to give a shit!

340
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,160
On the contrary.
We spoke to Immigration.

341
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,080
They have no record of your father
entering the country.

342
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,960
- That's impossible.
- What's really going on?

343
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,800
Were you, perhaps, planning
to smuggle out a little something?

344
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,520
Hey, those are mine!
What's going on here?

345
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,400
We checked you out of the hotel.
You may change at the airport.

346
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,320
You're going home.

347
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,200
- You cannot do that.
- I can and will.

348
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,080
Can I trust you to take him
to the airport without him escaping?

349
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,920
Yes, sir.

350
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,800
- What about Finley's murder?
- You're no longer a suspect.

351
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,640
- I'm still your only witness!
- We have your testimony, thank you.

352
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,520
Enjoy your flight, Mr. Cafmeyer.

353
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,400
- You're not helping me!
- Come on!

354
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,320
You're full of shit!
What's going on here?

355
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,160
What did you find?

356
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,600
Today, as every year at this time...

357
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:59,440
we come to this special place...

358
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,320
to commemorate the departure...

359
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,200
of the Knights of Christendom
from these shores.

360
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,040
Brother Cyrus will now lead us
in a passage from the Fazar.

361
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,800
Thank you, First Disciple.

362
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,600
As was prophesied
in the Book of Tribulations...

363
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,440
we await the return
of the Army of God...

364
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,320
who shall rise like a tide
against the sea...

365
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,160
of those who do not believe.

366
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,720
Cyrus...

367
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,560
by what authority do you quote
from that disreputable source?

368
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,400
As second disciple, you of all
our brothers should know better!

369
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,240
I beg your forgiveness.
It was an unpardonable error.

370
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,080
Le Vaillant himself once followed
a false path toward God.

371
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,920
We must choose our words carefully.

372
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,800
Wars have started for less.

373
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,640
I will ask for forgiveness
at evening vespers.

374
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,320
Your flight doesn't leave for
a few hours. You hungry?

375
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,160
Oh, someone here
actually cares about me.

376
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,040
We may be overly cautious
about our security...

377
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,960
and protective of our artifacts...

378
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,800
but we're not barbarians,
Mr. Cafmeyer.

379
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,640
It would be a shame if you left
without sampling some fresh hummus.

380
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,240
You like?

381
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,120
- I'd like it more without this.
- Sorry.

382
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,000
Look, I came here to find my father.

383
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,880
He told me he was in trouble.

384
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,800
He's the type of guy
who never lies.

385
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,640
Sounds like you really care
about him.

386
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,480
The two of you must be very close.

387
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,320
He taught me everything...
about paintings, antiques.

388
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,160
- You name it.
- Well, you applied that knowledge.

389
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,000
Let's say I did.
I never meant to hurt him.

390
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,920
And that's bothering you now?

391
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,760
Yes, because now he's missing,
and I'm realizing what I missed.

392
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,520
Why am I telling you all this?

393
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,360
You're tired.
You're jet-lagged.

394
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,240
You'll feel a lot better
once you're back on the plane.

395
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,080
I'll feel better when I find him.

396
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,600
This attack
was a brutal and senseless act...

397
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,400
perpetrated on a man who devoted
his life to God and to peace.

398
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:18,160
We, his brothers and sisters,
mourn his passing...

399
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,000
and pray that those responsible
find repentance in their hearts.

400
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,880
- Who died?
- Pierre Gardet...

401
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,760
the leader of some religious sect.

402
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,600
You mean the Order?

403
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,560
Come on. This way.

404
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,120
Come on.
Please keep on moving.

405
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,120
Get the prisoner off the plane.
I want him brought back here.

406
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,080
Why?

407
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,920
We've been informed
he's leaving with an artifact.

408
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,840
Customs checked him.
I saw him changing.

409
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,680
Just do it, Lieutenant!

410
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,320
- What's going on?
- You're staying in Israel.

411
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:54,160
- What?
- You're smuggling an artifact.

412
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:58,000
Do you believe that?

413
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,840
Something is not kosher here.
I'm not trying to be funny, okay?

414
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,280
When I signal,
run to the back stairs.

415
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,040
There's a service road
on the far side of the tarmac.

416
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,960
- If you make it, I'll be waiting.
- If I make it?

417
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,800
Now push me. Just push me.

418
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,600
Over here! He's escaping!

419
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:35,440
Quick!

420
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,240
Back up!

421
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,080
Quick! I need assistance up here!

422
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,320
What are you doing?

423
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,160
The stairs are slowing him down!
We can catch him!

424
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:10,960
Get in the back. Hurry.

425
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,800
Get down. You all right?

426
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:23,440
We missed him.
He went over the fence.

427
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,640
Okay, we're safe now.

428
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,480
Safe from what?
I've got some questions for you.

429
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,360
I used to belong to the Order.

430
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:52,240
What?

431
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,120
You should have told me this before.

432
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,080
Rudy, I couldn't.

433
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,960
Of course not,
because you're part of it.

434
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,840
No, because I didn't know
any of this was related.

435
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:05,680
- Sure. You dealt with my father.
- Where are you going?

436
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,400
- I just risked my ass for you!
- Why?

437
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,280
So you can hand me over
to the Order?

438
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,160
- I left the Order when I was 18.
- Oh, you left the Order?

439
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,080
I wanted to create my own life.

440
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:23,920
So meeting you at the airport
was no accident, right?

441
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,760
Look, Rudy, let me just explain
a few things to you, okay?

442
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,560
Most of the followers
are peaceful and life-affirming.

443
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,440
There is a small group of fanatics
who believe in a darker path.

444
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,360
They call themselves
the Army of God.

445
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:41,200
They've been on standby for years.

446
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,080
And you think these are the guys
who took my father?

447
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,920
I don't know, Rudy. They might also
be the ones who killed Gardet.

448
00:47:56,560 --> 00:48:00,400
Hey, Rudy, my friend.

449
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,240
- Who's the cop?
- Everything's fine. She's with us.

450
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:10,000
Look, my friend. Look what I
printed out for you from the disk.

451
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:32,080
- It's not translated yet, but...
- It looks like a map of Jerusalem.

452
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,960
Middle Ages, European design.

453
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,800
- What's the language?
- Aramit.

454
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,680
It was the language of Palestinian
Christians during the Crusades.

455
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,560
Okay, see these lines
here and here?

456
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:47,440
They are caves and tunnels
beneath the old city.

457
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,320
They've remained hidden
since the Holy Wars.

458
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,240
Professor Finley
told me about those.

459
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:56,080
But what he didn't tell you
was what they lead to.

460
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,920
Ask yourselves, why would
an archaeology professor...

461
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,800
bring the scrolls to New York
but leave the map in Israel...

462
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,640
hidden inside a safe deposit box?

463
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:10,480
Because the map leads to something
even more valuable.

464
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,080
It's the people who just left.
They forgot something.

465
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:23,920
Let's hide this.

466
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,520
Hands in the air!

467
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,440
Get them up!

468
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,320
Move!

469
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:42,160
Where is it?

470
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,800
Freeze!

471
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:34,960
Fuck!

472
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,960
Give me that.

473
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:02,800
Come on.

474
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,200
Thank you, Avram.

475
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:33,040
After all this time,
you come back to me like this.

476
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:42,640
You know I've had to make
some difficult choices.

477
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,560
You chose to leave.

478
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:47,440
Please, can we talk
about this later?

479
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,280
I really need some water
and clean rags right now.

480
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:58,000
Here's some water.

481
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,840
Thank you, Avram.

482
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,080
Where am I?

483
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:23,920
A friend's.

484
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,760
How long have I been here?

485
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,600
Two days now.

486
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,520
You really should rest.

487
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,480
I'm okay.

488
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,320
Well enough to leave?

489
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:44,080
Israeli hospitality kills me.

490
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:47,920
No, it just saved your life.

491
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,720
Here.

492
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,600
- Your father's book.
- Yeah.

493
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:59,440
I've been going through this.

494
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,280
You really should too.

495
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,880
The last chapter
predicts a revolution...

496
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:16,720
one that is peaceful
and spiritual in nature.

497
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,600
This will not be good news
to the radical Army of God...

498
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:23,440
who contend that Le Vaillant
prophesied a catastrophic holy war.

499
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,280
I suspect this militant faction
will stop at nothing...

500
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,120
to suppress the true contents
of this final chapter.

501
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:33,040
Though my own safety
may be at issue...

502
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,920
I have requested an interview
with the first disciple...

503
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,760
to make these matters known.

504
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,680
Your scholar
seems to be on the verge...

505
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,600
of enlightenment.

506
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:47,440
It wouldn't hurt you
to sample some of it yourself.

507
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,320
Dalia, the world
is as filled with temptations...

508
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:54,160
as it is with false prophets.

509
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:59,920
Onions. I need onions.

510
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,640
- Is everything okay?
- We were just...

511
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,560
We were just discussing
your father's manuscript.

512
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:11,440
It's a fraud.

513
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,400
A fraud?

514
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,280
The scrolls, they were tested.

515
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,200
By whom? Secular scientists?

516
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,080
- If you would just open your mind.
- To what?

517
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:23,920
To this, Avram.

518
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,800
What is this?

519
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:27,760
What is this?

520
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,640
It's mentioned in the Thesuar.

521
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,520
Solomon's gold. A treasure the
ancient Hebrews hid under the city.

522
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:37,360
Which might explain why people with guns
have been chasing us all over Israel.

523
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,240
It explains nothing
but your ignorance.

524
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,080
The treasure is a metaphor
for the wisdom of the ancient sages.

525
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,920
Avram, I need to
get to the monastery.

526
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,800
- I think they're holding my father.
- Impossible.

527
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,720
No outsider is permitted.

528
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,600
What about an insider?

529
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:59,440
A member from overseas
that is here on pilgrimage.

530
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,640
That's Cyrus...

531
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:46,480
the new first disciple.

532
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,000
Children of God...

533
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,880
I stand here before you today...

534
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,800
in great sorrow...

535
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,720
for what should be a celebration
of hope and joy...

536
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:08,560
must instead be looked upon
as a call to action.

537
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,440
God's vengeance
for this murderous deed...

538
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:15,280
will be swift and without mercy.

539
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:21,040
May the eternal spirit
of Pierre Gardet...

540
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:24,880
guide us on this path
of deliverance.

541
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:28,720
It's the best time
to see if my father's alive.

542
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,560
Try the catacombs first.

543
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:37,360
That door leads
to a small stairway.

544
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:41,200
Follow it all the way down.

545
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:46,000
Be careful.

546
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,880
Dad, are you all right?

547
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:37,840
Yes.

548
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:40,720
Let me get you out of here.

549
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,640
I already tried.

550
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,520
No, forget about me.

551
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,440
You have to stop him.

552
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,320
Pull off that tarp.

553
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,240
You will see
what this is all about.

554
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:56,080
Rudy, go. Go.

555
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,120
This looks like...

556
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,040
A bomb?

557
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,920
Sorry we're late, Mr. Cafmeyer...

558
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,800
but I could give a shit
about this coronation.

559
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,720
Tonight...

560
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,640
we will all witness a miracle...

561
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:34,480
as God's fury cleanses the souls
of those who stand against us.

562
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:37,360
Let the new age...

563
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,280
begin!

564
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,160
- Where are you going?
- To find Rudy.

565
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:46,000
We have to put a stop to this.

566
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,880
All right, I'm coming with you.

567
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:52,720
This way.

568
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:55,600
Dalia, stop!

569
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:59,440
It's a trap!

570
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:02,320
Now, be a good girl, Dalia,
and come down here.

571
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:06,160
And since when did you take your vows
with the Order, Major?

572
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:09,040
The day Cyrus vowed there was
a treasure under the temple mount.

573
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:12,880
That's the day I found religion.

574
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:16,720
Hello, Professor.

575
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:19,600
Dad...

576
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:20,560
meet Dalia.

577
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:22,480
She's a good cop.

578
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,400
Now let's ask the major...

579
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:28,240
what the big bomb is for.

580
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,040
It's Ramadan.

581
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:36,880
Islamic leaders from around the world
will be on the temple mount at noon.

582
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,800
What are you saying?

583
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,680
This nutcase is gonna blow it up?

584
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,600
That will start World War III.

585
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,520
Especially when
they find the bodies...

586
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,400
of an Israeli and an American
beneath the rubble.

587
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,280
Oh, no, you're crazy.
This is impossible.

588
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:55,120
You have completely misinterpreted
the words of the first disciple.

589
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:57,040
And you...

590
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:00,880
are a naive moron.

591
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:05,680
You have truly lost the way, Cyrus.

592
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:06,640
On the contrary...

593
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:09,520
I have found it.

594
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:12,400
I want to thank you,
young Cafmeyer...

595
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:16,240
for unwittingly providing
the final piece of the puzzle.

596
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,160
And thank you, Avram...

597
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,080
for your unwavering
loyalty and devotion.

598
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:23,920
But, First Disciple,
what they're saying here is insane.

599
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,760
If you've read the Book of Tribulations
carefully, you are aware...

600
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,640
that the Holy War is triggered
by a singular event.

601
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:34,480
Behold the event.

602
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:38,320
And as my unwavering one...

603
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,240
I shall grant you the privilege
of assisting us.

604
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:42,160
Bind him...

605
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,120
and her too.

606
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:46,960
Now, where is my guide?

607
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,440
Dad!

608
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:00,400
Stop!

609
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,320
There is no need for that!

610
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:05,200
Does this mean you'll be
assisting us too, Professor?

611
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,160
What's he talking about?

612
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:10,000
With the map you brought us, your father
can now guide us under the temple mount.

613
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:12,880
Please.

614
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,800
Millions will die.

615
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:15,760
It is written.

616
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,640
"I will raze Mt. Moriah
and build upon it a new temple."

617
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:22,480
That prophecy you are quoting
is a fabrication.

618
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,280
Wait. Don't do shit for him.

619
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,240
Apparently...

620
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,120
stubbornness is
an ingrained family trait.

621
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:34,960
Beats a messiah complex any day.

622
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,840
Stop! I will do it.

623
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:38,800
I will guide you.

624
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:41,680
God help us all.

625
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:45,520
He helps those
who help themselves, Professor.

626
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:45,040
We are near the temple mount.

627
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:46,960
That is where the traps begin.

628
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:50,800
Perhaps we should use
someone expendable to lead the way.

629
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,640
Young Mr. Cafmeyer...

630
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:58,480
we have a job for you.

631
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:09,040
- Be careful.
- Okay.

632
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,800
Go.

633
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:26,320
Somebody help him! No!
Let me go, damn it!

634
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,080
Be careful, Rudy!

635
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:35,920
Come on, Avram.

636
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,560
You deceived me.

637
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:48,400
This is the way,
according to the map.

638
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:51,280
- Then how do we proceed?
- What's the matter with you guys?

639
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:55,120
You see these beams?
We take them down and build a bridge.

640
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:24,880
Oh, my God.

641
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,320
This is not the well of souls.

642
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:05,200
In the next chamber, I swear!

643
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:09,040
Show me.

644
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,000
Directly above us...

645
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:34,960
the Dome of the Rock...

646
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:38,800
Islam's third-holiest shrine.

647
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:42,640
And henceforth,
from this day forward...

648
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:46,480
the holiest shrine in the Order.

649
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:58,000
Cyrus, I beg you to reconsider.

650
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,600
Bring the bomb.

651
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,520
Hold on. Hold on.

652
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,440
We'll get to that.

653
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:15,280
- First we fill these bags.
- There's no time.

654
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:20,080
Take a look around you, Cyrus.

655
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,000
There's a king's treasure here...

656
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,840
enough to finance
ten of your holy wars.

657
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:28,720
We set the bomb now.

658
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:32,560
We can do this the easy way...

659
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:37,360
or the very easy way.

660
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:43,120
I have a prophecy to fulfill.

661
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:46,000
And I have a Swiss
bank account to fill.

662
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,840
That's the only reason I joined
your crazy scheme in the first place.

663
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,560
- Idiot!
- Professor, here!

664
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:00,400
Stop them!
Don't let them get away!

665
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,680
Rudy! Your dad!

666
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:21,520
Dad, you're hit.

667
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,440
Come on.

668
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:27,280
Let's go. Over here.

669
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:39,760
Dad, you stay here.
We'll be back for you.

670
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:43,600
- I'll be fine.
- Let's go.

671
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:46,480
They did not come this far.

672
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:50,320
We must have passed them.
Come on, let's double back.

673
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:54,160
Let's split. Go.

674
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:58,960
Get after him.
I'll take care of that bitch.

675
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:42,160
Help me with these.

676
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:46,000
Assist him.

677
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:05,200
Shit!

678
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:40,240
Hey, Dad, meet Dalia.

679
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:42,160
She's the dead cop!

680
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:46,000
Wrong, Major.

681
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,640
Professor.

682
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:58,480
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

683
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:05,200
- Take my father out of here.
- What about you?

684
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:08,080
I've got to stop the bomb.

685
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:10,960
Please be careful.

686
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:13,840
Come on, Professor.

687
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:16,720
Let's go.

688
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:20,560
- Are you ready for this?
- Thank you.

689
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,800
The bomb is set.

690
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:42,640
It's irreversible.

691
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:48,400
The prophecy will be fulfilled...

692
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:52,240
and I will vanquish my enemy.

693
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:34,000
You can't stop the prophecy.

694
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:42,640
You read the wrong book, pal.

695
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:44,080
Now...

696
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,000
it's time to say...

697
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:46,960
bon voyage!

698
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:50,800
Shalom!

699
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,840
Please stay calm.

700
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:31,600
My main man!

701
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,520
Hey, this is great.

702
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:36,400
Just a few more to sign,
and then we can go to lunch.

703
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:40,240
Take your time.

704
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:47,920
Don't touch that!

705
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:51,760
I'm sorry.
What is this?

706
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:53,680
It is a map
which purports to show...

707
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:57,520
the location of the fabled seven cities
of Cibola, near Cancun...

708
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,400
on the Yucatan Peninsula.

709
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:01,360
Oh.

710
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:04,240
These, ostensibly...

711
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:07,120
are the legendary...

712
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:09,040
cities of gold...

713
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:11,920
containing the Mayan treasure...

714
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,840
which the Spanish conquistadors...

715
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:16,720
so desperately had sought.

716
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:20,560
And, to answer
your inevitable next question...

717
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:24,400
yes, it is quite valuable.

718
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,040
So, where to, young Cafmeyer?

719
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:34,960
Cancun, Mexico.

720
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,880
Will that be business or pleasure?

721
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:40,720
Pleasure, always.

722
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:41,200
Cut.
