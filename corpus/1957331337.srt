1
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,500
Wow.

2
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,800
Yes!

3
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,729
Here we are today in a
house full of friends

4
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,460
standing in total support of this marriage.

5
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,960
Betty,

6
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,299
you've been such a positive
force of change in this house.

7
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,099
And your strength and
the warmth you radiate

8
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,629
have brought such stability and joy

9
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,260
not only to Kevin, but to all of us.

10
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,499
We all knew from day one
that Kevin is a great guy

11
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,530
openhearted and kind.

12
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,999
But, it's been such a thrill to see

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,800
an even greater man emerge
from this partnership.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,959
One committed to being here

15
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,660
in all the ways that could be interpreted.

16
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,629
I hope the two of you continue
to be excited by one another,

17
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,259
to feel at home with one another,

18
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,330
and to be proud and joyful
to have found one another.

19
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,000
Alright. Now...

20
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:19,860
Kevin,

21
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,530
do you take Betty to be your wife?

22
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,100
I do, I do, I do.

23
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,660
Do you take Kevin to be your husband?

24
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,630
Yes, I do.

25
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,400
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

26
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,330
You may kiss the bride.

27
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:08,530
What's the alcohol content in the tea?

28
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,160
Cause, somebody was asking me...

29
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,099
I mean, you can give them a vague
answer if they ask about that.

30
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,129
That it's not enough for it to
have to qualify for anything...

31
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,627
Like, if they drink the whole jar
they're not going to get a little drunk?

32
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,499
No.

33
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,100
It's like 0.0000 percent.

34
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,130
What's the plan for the honeymoon?

35
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,729
- Oh, uh...
- Honeymoon.

36
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,460
Honeymoon, yes honeymoon.

37
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,029
If you guys wanna head
out of the house tonight

38
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,059
do something on your own that's more...

39
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,499
Entirely up to Betty.

40
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,426
Yeah, I mean tonight
would be a good night.

41
00:03:41,456 --> 00:03:43,200
Asking if there's
a honeymoon plan.

42
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,700
The lake?

43
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,800
Lake? Wait,
I think the first step would be Betty

44
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,300
actually opening the front door,

45
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,999
- walking down the sidewalk...
- That would be part of it.

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,181
Seeing the outside world for
the first time in a long time.

47
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:56,129
That will be part of it.

48
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:00,829
Yeah, at some point maybe
I'll decide to do that, okay.

49
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:04,429
Participate as some gentle neighbor
like some other people in this house.

50
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,960
Hey, I do a lot of work.

51
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,960
I clean up after all of you.

52
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,559
But, I'm happy here.

53
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,630
I don't really need to go out yet.

54
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,129
Honeymoon was when the moon
was at its absolute fullest

55
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,960
the very second it began to wane.

56
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,429
It was called the honeymoon
cause it was like a

57
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,899
pot of honey that was about
to start spilling over.

58
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,329
Sounds a little dirty, man.

59
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:35,600
Well, it's kind of this negative
implication that this is the

60
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,329
the fullest point of the marriage

61
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:42,830
- and from here on it empties.
- Oh, huh.

62
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:47,359
See, we're all gonna come to...
things are gonna change around again.

63
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,659
New mom.

64
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,435
Don't be offended if
I don't call you mom.

65
00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:52,400
I won't.

66
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,299
I wanna thank you Courtney

67
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,500
for, especially for
everything you've done for me.

68
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,600
I realize that...

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,730
in a lot of ways,
I haven't been a very good father.

70
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,200
I think that's all gonna change now.

71
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,599
- Cool.
- Here, here.

72
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,000
Do you think it's different, though?

73
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,230
Betty? To be married,
do you feel more comfortable?

74
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,800
Yes. I feel happy, I feel...

75
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,629
This is, what a treat.

76
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,730
Eight candles, eight years.

77
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,859
- On three?
- Okay.

78
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,260
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

79
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,500
- Pssst.
- Hmm?

80
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,459
I don't know.

81
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,800
Do you think that was a good idea?

82
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,630
Yeah, now I do.

83
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,959
Keep your hands up.

84
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,159
Keep your hands up.
I want you to come out with jabs.

85
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,529
And give me a one, two, three.

86
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,000
Harder, harder.

87
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,829
Do you have any pennies
that you can put in here?

88
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,760
Got nothing?

89
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:09,001
Got any change in your pockets?

90
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,060
There you go.

91
00:08:22,061 --> 00:08:23,400
Come on, jab.

92
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,360
Alright.

93
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,560
There you go.

94
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,059
Fuck you!

95
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,229
Fuck you, you goddamn cunt!

96
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,799
This is all your fault. Look at me.

97
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,330
Look at me! What do you think happened?

98
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,360
Fuck you.

99
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:05,529
You do this every time.

100
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,899
You start a fight,
and you go and get drunk.

101
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,429
- Where's my gun? Where's my gun?
- Kevin.

102
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,629
Where's my fucking gun?

103
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,930
That gun is gone.

104
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,699
- What'd you do with it?
- That gun is gone.

105
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,900
I'm gonna fucking kill these scumbags.

106
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,530
What happened?

107
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,860
- Tell me what happened.
- I told you!

108
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,130
Tell me what happened.

109
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,900
They fucking pissed on me!

110
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,999
They fucking pissed on me!

111
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,460
After they beat the shit outta me.

112
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,500
Took my own clothes off.

113
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,699
Took my own...
alright, are you satisfied now?

114
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,229
You know the fucking truth.

115
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,900
Why did they beat you?

116
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,700
Because I smacked her into the wall.

117
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,659
She started dragging me
into the fucking bar.

118
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,430
So, I smacked her.

119
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,699
And when I went to smack her
again, they grabbed me.

120
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,899
I don't know what happened to her.

121
00:10:06,931 --> 00:10:09,359
What, what, what...

122
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,100
It's okay, I was okay.

123
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,860
I was okay.

124
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,900
I was okay, remember?

125
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,170
- What'd they do with you?
- That lady took me.

126
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,230
The lady took me.

127
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,230
I came back.

128
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,800
You're glad the cops took you away from me.

129
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,360
Yay. Now we know.

130
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,060
Now they know.

131
00:10:41,061 --> 00:10:42,230
Good job, Kevin.

132
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,800
They know now.

133
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,159
So, it's as bad as it got.

134
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,860
It's okay.

135
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,030
You're all sweaty.

136
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,160
It's okay.

137
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,700
We're all here.

138
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,900
You don't have to keep crying.

139
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,000
You don't have to cry.

140
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,360
What do you want me to think of you?

141
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,859
What do you want me to think of you?

142
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,960
You want me to think that you're a

143
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,400
fucking, heartless bitch?

144
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,400
Don't come near me, don't come near me.

145
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,830
You like me.

146
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,600
No, I liked you. I liked you.

147
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,759
When you weren't a fucking mess, okay?

148
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,300
Don't touch me.

149
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,829
Yeah, yeah. My name is Tina.

150
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,260
My name is Tina.

151
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,699
It would be nice if you
knew my fucking name, okay?

152
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,600
- It'd be nice.
- I know your name.

153
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,030
- Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina, Tina.
- Okay.

154
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,729
- I love you, Tina. I love you.
- I get it.

155
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,059
- You love me too.
- I don't.

156
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,200
- Say it. You love me.
- I don't. Okay?

157
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,099
How am I supposed to leave when
I don't have any fucking shoes?

158
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,260
Let me help.

159
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,159
I thought you were gonna take my pillow.

160
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,643
Yes, I could.
What, do you have a bag you can...

161
00:12:46,673 --> 00:12:47,560
Take my pillow.

162
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,699
This is comical.

163
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,899
What the fuck, Ann?

164
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,800
Do you see yourself?

165
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,000
Jesus fucking christ.

166
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,560
Can you please just get your shit, please?

167
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,529
I can put up with a lot.

168
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,670
And living in this house,
I have to put up with a lot.

169
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,660
But, I can not stand laziness.

170
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,399
That's the bottomline.

171
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,660
And that's what it is.

172
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,960
Bye.

173
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,600
What's that cocksucker doing right now?
He's on the couch.

174
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,100
He's not sick.

175
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,030
If I were to go out, he's sick.

176
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,730
You don't have to go around.

177
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:28,060
I mean, ask Jim... why Gene sits around.

178
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,760
Why he doesn't help you and
get off his fucking ass.

179
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,430
Oh, you know he's not ready.

180
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,200
Embarrassed.

181
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,659
The dude is already embarrassed enough
every time he looks in the mirror.

182
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,630
You know what, put that in the front.

183
00:14:39,631 --> 00:14:41,330
But then, I don't want anything after.

184
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,200
You're so stupid.

185
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,059
All this dude does is talk about
how he needs to lose weight.

186
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,959
Then what'd he do?
As soon as the bread dish came out,

187
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,960
One, two, three, four...

188
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,730
It's like, you know
what, it feels like he...

189
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,159
Don't complain, and then...

190
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,921
do exactly what's causing the thing
you're fucking complaining about.

191
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,159
It's like,
if I have to listen to you bitch,

192
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,660
at least fucking do something about
it, and shut the fuck up.

193
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:14,460
It's a place where we all
live and choose to be sober.

194
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,630
Choose to live together,
choose to be sober.

195
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,400
That sounds like some weird, hippie shit.

196
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,730
A tonic of love, wow.

197
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,730
Is this like a joke?

198
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,280
Hey, you're the fucking
joke you fucking poser.

199
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,159
Are you fucking kidding me?
Are you trying to sell a fucking product?

200
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,599
Or are you coming up here and you're
trying to fucking start shit with me?

201
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,999
Like, I didn't fucking do anything.

202
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,280
It's a fermented, healthy drink.

203
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,329
- What kind of drink was it?
- Basically, it's like a tea.

204
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:43,829
- Five dollars, I don't know if I could...
- It's a tea.

205
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,999
It's made, it's infused... it's um...

206
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,199
like an infusion,
it's sort of made from a fungus...

207
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,160
actually, it's very interesting.

208
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,259
Yeah, it's derived from, um...

209
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,660
medicinal drinks from the east.

210
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,799
I've kind of perfected the recipe here...

211
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,159
So, where do you ferment this?
Like, in your backyard?

212
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,300
Um, yeah, in my home.

213
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,629
Would you like to try a little bit?

214
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,400
I'm gonna fucking do it.

215
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,860
What does it taste like?
What does it taste like?

216
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,999
It tastes a little bit funny.
It's a little unfamiliar at first,

217
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,729
but it's really delicious, it's like...

218
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,499
- I'm not gonna throw up, right?
- No, not at all, no.

219
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,630
Alright.

220
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,929
I dare you to fucking drink it.

221
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,230
Sorry, do...

222
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,830
Yeah, it's...

223
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,600
Um, Lucy can help you up.

224
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,230
Take a photo of your guitar.

225
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,029
Take your fucking guitar.

226
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,660
That's the place he likes to be.

227
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,099
I think we're getting
some fucking drugs today.

228
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,860
I'm outta here. I'm outta here.

229
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,199
Uh, so we're selling this.

230
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,500
This is uh, um...

231
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,259
It's a fermented tea.

232
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,299
- It's a health drink.
- Fermented tea?

233
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,500
- Yeah. Would you like to try it?
- Yeah.

234
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,400
- You guys made this yourself?
- Yeah.

235
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,899
We, um... we live in a house.

236
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,160
It's a sort of sober-living home.

237
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,360
How are things coming?

238
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,729
Things are good. Yeah.

239
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,029
Things are really kinda clipping on nicely.

240
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,329
So, yeah.

241
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,800
How much do you need this time?

242
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:27,699
Um, I just need like... twelve?

243
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,800
Okay.

244
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,230
And, how's your wife?

245
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,059
- Lucy's good, yeah.
- Yeah?

246
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,099
Everything's going well, yeah.
It's been a...

247
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,959
we've been on a good streak, so...

248
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm glad.

249
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,499
Staying off the bottle?

250
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,629
Staying off the bottle.

251
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,900
- Looking for work?
- Looking for work.

252
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,830
I don't want you to end
up like your father.

253
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,729
- You promise?
- I promise.

254
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:49,730
Okay.

255
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,300
How you been?

256
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:54,360
Okay. I won't be here forever, so...

257
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,759
You gotta think about what
you're gonna be doing.

258
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,599
You can always come here to work.

259
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,699
- Alright.
- Alright?

260
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,260
I appreciate it, Marge.

261
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,659
- I'll see you soon.
- Alright.

262
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,330
- Love you.
- Love you too.

263
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:11,800
- Oh, say hi to Duane on your way out.
- Alright.

264
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,629
Jim, Jim.
I wanna move to the house with you.

265
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,759
I know you have all those women there,

266
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,459
- I was hoping I could come...
- Yeah...

267
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,030
I don't think that would work out.

268
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,259
No, I think it'd be good. It'd be a good

269
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,699
chance for me to meet some women...

270
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,492
Yeah, it's not what the
house is really for though,

271
00:18:27,522 --> 00:18:29,029
and you don't really have a
problem, so...

272
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:32,229
The problem is that I'd like to
meet somebody or something...

273
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,999
Right, it's not that kinda house.

274
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,729
Okay. But, see I was wondering

275
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:38,229
cause there's a girl at the
library that I really like...

276
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,759
You should go to the library then.

277
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,599
Right, but I need some like
practice or something...

278
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,600
You don't get to practice at the house.

279
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,659
- Well, how can I come over to the house?
- I hear you Duane.

280
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,400
- Look Duane, I hear you.
- I just wanna go over to the house...

281
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,730
So, these are the house rules.

282
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,430
It's a little bit daunting at first,
but you'll get the hang of it.

283
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,829
Alright. So, rule number one is stay sober.

284
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:01,130
You can't have any drugs or
alcohol in the house, um...

285
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,930
Pretty firm rule.
That's why it's number one.

286
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,399
You must partake in all
the group activities

287
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,499
unless you're sick,
or if there's some other

288
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,630
rare reason why you can't.

289
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:14,059
If you have any debts,
warrants, medical conditions,

290
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:17,530
or anything else looming over you,
you must be upfront when you come.

291
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,530
- You have any?
- No.

292
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,199
- Nothing?
- Unh-uh.

293
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,300
- Nobody's gonna come knocking on our door?
- No.

294
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,859
Be healthy. So just make sure
you're exercising, sleeping,

295
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,860
eating, hydrating.

296
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,529
Don't get too worried about your fashion.

297
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,229
Simple and comfy attire.

298
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,429
- Few different changes of clothes.
- Jim, I can't do this.

299
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,000
This is completely unhealthy for me.

300
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,563
If you can be in a place together, and both

301
00:19:41,564 --> 00:19:44,799
like, actually give this a try,
and actually try and build something,

302
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,799
like, you having no control
over what becomes of your life,

303
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,699
is something that we all have to deal with.

304
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,932
That was exactly the point.

305
00:19:50,933 --> 00:19:52,663
I was taking control of my life.

306
00:19:52,664 --> 00:19:54,333
I wanna get better too, Betty.

307
00:19:54,334 --> 00:19:56,499
She's completely manipulative.

308
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,066
We're gonna figure it out.

309
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,399
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be fine.

310
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,033
I know this is tricky.
We have to get through the rules.

311
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:04,999
We're gonna have daily discussions and

312
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,563
meals, reenactments,
all these kinds of things.

313
00:20:07,564 --> 00:20:10,200
You have to really come into
them with a certain level of

314
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,466
earnestness and enthusiasm and

315
00:20:12,566 --> 00:20:15,866
trying to uh, just commit to being here.

316
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,599
Um, it's a different way of living.

317
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,933
Like, it'll take a few
days to adjust to it.

318
00:20:20,566 --> 00:20:21,566
Betty.

319
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:24,133
Betty, where are you going?

320
00:20:24,366 --> 00:20:26,729
It's gonna take a few days

321
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,433
for all of us to adjust to it.

322
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,833
Betty, what's the matter?

323
00:20:30,834 --> 00:20:32,800
Nothing, nothing's wrong. I'm fine.

324
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,433
What difference does it
make if she comes here?

325
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:36,799
- It's, I just wanna be alone.
- I love you.

326
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,400
Thank you, I know. I love you too.

327
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,600
I just need to be alone. Okay?

328
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:51,366
You know the Heimlich maneuver.

329
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:52,666
We invented it.

330
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,533
Who would you eat first
at this dinner table?

331
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:06,500
Which one of us would you
eat if you were cattle?

332
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:08,800
C'mon, that's a load of questions.

333
00:21:10,866 --> 00:21:13,466
- I'd probably eat you first.
- Why?

334
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:15,166
To shut you up.

335
00:21:18,266 --> 00:21:21,266
You daughter is here. Have some respect.

336
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,500
Right? Right?

337
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,699
Well, he started it.

338
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,863
He's a twelve-year-old.

339
00:21:26,864 --> 00:21:29,866
When I'm around him,
I'm a twelve-year-old boy.

340
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,533
You sure got some good
looking potatoes, Betty.

341
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,400
Betty, domesticate your animals.

342
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,032
- Please.
- He can do what he wants.

343
00:21:44,033 --> 00:21:45,066
Eat with a dagger.

344
00:21:45,633 --> 00:21:47,233
How did you and Betty meet?

345
00:21:50,866 --> 00:21:52,366
Do you wanna tell them?

346
00:21:53,033 --> 00:21:54,700
No. Why?

347
00:21:55,933 --> 00:21:57,200
Okay.

348
00:21:58,366 --> 00:22:00,966
Well, we met at a show.

349
00:22:01,433 --> 00:22:02,633
And...

350
00:22:06,433 --> 00:22:07,466
Deep sigh.

351
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,300
Yeah, really.

352
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,333
We met at a show...

353
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:14,100
um... and...

354
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:18,200
I noticed her, she's getting

355
00:22:18,566 --> 00:22:21,033
harassed by some

356
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,133
like, some photographer, I dunno.

357
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,633
They're gonna get into a fight.

358
00:22:25,634 --> 00:22:28,466
I dunno, I didn't see what happened
before, but all I saw

359
00:22:28,566 --> 00:22:31,266
was this girl just fucking

360
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,866
knock this fucker out.

361
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,099
- Right hook?
- Yup.

362
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,232
- Then you saw fireworks?
- Yes.

363
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:39,799
It's not really what happened.

364
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,299
- Yes it is.
- No it isn't.

365
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,759
- Yes it is.
- No.

366
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,329
I was taking pictures.

367
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,359
This guy was moshing. Sorry...

368
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,500
Um, this guy was moshing.

369
00:22:48,566 --> 00:22:51,299
And he bumped into me, knocked my camera

370
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,166
fell on the floor, cracked the lens.

371
00:22:53,233 --> 00:22:55,599
And then I was yelling at him

372
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,166
and he pushed me, and so I punched him.

373
00:22:58,167 --> 00:23:00,899
- Wow. Yeah.
- Because he pushed me.

374
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,099
- Did you really knock him out?
- Yeah.

375
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,663
- You fucking fell over...
- Good for you.

376
00:23:05,664 --> 00:23:06,833
Did he lose any teeth?

377
00:23:06,834 --> 00:23:10,159
Ann? I just wanted you to know that...

378
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,033
we're all a community here.

379
00:23:12,133 --> 00:23:15,000
We're all one big family.

380
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,466
So, this is the room that you'll stay in.

381
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,833
Everything that you'll
need is in this bucket.

382
00:23:26,033 --> 00:23:28,433
And then the bleach is up here.

383
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:33,566
- So, really all you have to do is pour...
- What's in the bathtub?

384
00:23:33,567 --> 00:23:35,666
Uh, that's the fermented tea.

385
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:42,133
So, probably about that much.

386
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,633
You know, you didn't have
to come to a place like this

387
00:24:10,634 --> 00:24:13,833
if you wanted to escape me.

388
00:24:17,566 --> 00:24:19,200
You're so full of shit.

389
00:24:19,466 --> 00:24:21,000
Go find your own life.

390
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,100
Right.

391
00:24:23,533 --> 00:24:25,600
Go if I know. And you know.

392
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:34,000
I missed you.

393
00:25:56,866 --> 00:25:59,100
It doesn't make any fucking sense.

394
00:25:59,566 --> 00:26:01,700
She just leaves like that way.

395
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,563
I've been supporting her.

396
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:05,666
I've been going along
with everything she says.

397
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:09,100
I mean, I haven't been fighting with her.

398
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,399
I've been treating her good, you know.

399
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,699
At least you guys only married a couple
of days, it'll be easy to get used to.

400
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,599
If it was thirty years or something,
I could understand, but...

401
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,900
Shit.

402
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,233
Ah shit man.

403
00:26:22,966 --> 00:26:24,433
The fuck.

404
00:26:27,133 --> 00:26:29,259
That's fucking why, her!

405
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,800
That fucking cunt.
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

406
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:36,899
I'm gonna shove my fucking fist up
your fucking goddamn fucking cunt!

407
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,065
Get her outta here,
or I'm gonna fucking kill her.

408
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:42,060
- Fuck.
- Stop it.

409
00:26:42,766 --> 00:26:44,000
Stop it.

410
00:26:44,266 --> 00:26:46,200
She'd better stay outside.

411
00:26:47,033 --> 00:26:48,832
I'm gonna get her fucking shit

412
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:51,100
and I'm gonna throw it out in the lawn.

413
00:26:52,033 --> 00:26:53,033
Fuck.

414
00:26:56,266 --> 00:26:57,400
Fuck.

415
00:26:58,566 --> 00:26:59,566
Fuck.

416
00:26:59,866 --> 00:27:01,459
Relax.

417
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,733
Try to breathe.

418
00:27:02,766 --> 00:27:04,266
Are you alright?

419
00:27:09,066 --> 00:27:10,766
I didn't know she would leave.

420
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,433
Sorry.

421
00:27:16,466 --> 00:27:18,032
Yeah, well you did it last time?

422
00:27:18,033 --> 00:27:20,232
- Yeah.
- Well, there's a lot left to do.

423
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:22,678
You must've missed stuff on the
list, because...

424
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:23,533
No.

425
00:27:23,534 --> 00:27:26,833
The list is right there
underneath all the fruit.

426
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,933
And just as Jim told me to,

427
00:27:29,033 --> 00:27:31,633
When I buy something, check it off.

428
00:27:31,866 --> 00:27:34,900
When I get to the house and
I put it in the cabinet,

429
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,066
put a line through it.

430
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,599
- Alright then we...
- You can check it.

431
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,600
It's right there.

432
00:27:40,601 --> 00:27:41,859
I believe you. I'm not...

433
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,327
I'm just saying then we have
gone through an extraordinary...

434
00:27:44,357 --> 00:27:45,333
The keys are in there.

435
00:27:45,334 --> 00:27:46,966
They're going to the store.

436
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:50,863
Stop taking those midnight
walks in the kitchen.

437
00:27:50,864 --> 00:27:51,933
What did you say?

438
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,895
I don't go for midnight
walks in the kitchen.

439
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:56,866
Yes.

440
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,466
- Okay.
- It's okay.

441
00:27:58,467 --> 00:27:59,933
- Okay.
- It'll be fine.

442
00:28:02,566 --> 00:28:04,100
It goes in the back drawer.

443
00:28:27,733 --> 00:28:29,600
Are you ready?

444
00:28:29,766 --> 00:28:30,900
Yeah.

445
00:29:44,933 --> 00:29:47,059
Just go, I'm sorry.

446
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,533
I gotta get off.

447
00:29:49,466 --> 00:29:51,233
You know what to do. You know what to do.

448
00:29:51,234 --> 00:29:53,133
Come on, just go. Just go.

449
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,533
Come on.

450
00:30:36,566 --> 00:30:38,300
Okay Kevin.

451
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,200
What?

452
00:30:40,433 --> 00:30:41,500
What?

453
00:30:47,366 --> 00:30:49,300
Oh, fuck me.

454
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,433
I'll go down on you for twenty dollars.

455
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,933
- Twenty dollars?
- Yeah.

456
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,533
- I can do that.
- Okay.

457
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:57,933
When I hit my head on concrete.

458
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,266
I cracked my skull, and some blood got in.

459
00:33:03,266 --> 00:33:05,100
And now I'm epileptic.

460
00:33:06,533 --> 00:33:08,866
I take medication, pills.

461
00:33:10,133 --> 00:33:11,700
I also woke up...

462
00:33:12,433 --> 00:33:14,566
with blood coming out of my nose...

463
00:33:15,033 --> 00:33:17,300
and cum all over my chest.

464
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,533
How'd you get cum on your chest, Gene?

465
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,366
He stood over me and finished.

466
00:33:27,633 --> 00:33:29,633
Was that your first time, Gene?

467
00:33:29,866 --> 00:33:31,166
Yeah.

468
00:33:33,566 --> 00:33:35,366
Did you get the twenty bucks?

469
00:33:35,633 --> 00:33:38,233
No I didn't, Al.

470
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,300
Thank you.

471
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,459
Good job, Gene.

472
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,699
Ann?

473
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,759
Good job.

474
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:54,033
You think you would want to share next?

475
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:55,466
Right now?

476
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,700
Yeah, I just feel like...

477
00:33:58,333 --> 00:34:01,759
- Um, no I think I'm okay.
- Okay, part of the...

478
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,966
rules that you've agreed to

479
00:34:04,133 --> 00:34:06,632
had a part about that you would participate

480
00:34:06,633 --> 00:34:10,600
in all group activity, and so far
you've just been a spectator and...

481
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,733
I think I'll wait, if that's alright.

482
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:17,266
- You're not gonna participate?
- Not today.

483
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,100
Alright, well would you go
and clean the bathroom then?

484
00:34:25,566 --> 00:34:28,333
♪ Love transcends ♪

485
00:34:30,133 --> 00:34:32,866
♪ love can win ♪

486
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:03,759
Al. You missed a spot.

487
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,733
There's still gravy on the pot.

488
00:35:10,666 --> 00:35:12,333
So, what are you trying to say Kevin?

489
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:17,866
The way I feel right now,
it would be easy enough to say maybe.

490
00:35:18,433 --> 00:35:21,763
The most I could say.
And even that would be bullshit.

491
00:35:21,764 --> 00:35:24,000
If you stay you think you'll relapse.

492
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,663
I mean, right now, maybe I could say maybe.

493
00:35:27,664 --> 00:35:29,966
That's the most I could
say, maybe I can say is...

494
00:35:29,967 --> 00:35:33,266
I could stay straight, if I... but...

495
00:35:42,666 --> 00:35:45,366
Right now, I don't give
a shit about any of that.

496
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,733
I'm gonna get high right now.

497
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,899
Kevin and anybody else
who decides to bring drugs

498
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,532
or do drugs while living here

499
00:36:25,533 --> 00:36:27,566
they have to leave, and they know that.

500
00:36:27,733 --> 00:36:30,463
And that's why I don't think
this is because Betty left.

501
00:36:30,464 --> 00:36:33,000
I don't think that he's gone because...

502
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,632
you know, you have to know
that this house is good for you

503
00:36:36,633 --> 00:36:38,630
this house does care for you.

504
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:43,329
He was still like a dad though

505
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:45,866
like in a lot of ways,
like when we were both

506
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,600
using at the same time,
like he never tried to

507
00:36:48,733 --> 00:36:51,232
hole me out, and I know a lot
of other dads who did that

508
00:36:51,233 --> 00:36:54,133
when they knew their daughters were
using, cause you just

509
00:36:54,366 --> 00:36:56,463
were like a parent, like you become a teen

510
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,099
and if your kid can provide
something, then you ask them to

511
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,699
and he never, he knew that
other people were doing that

512
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:05,000
and he never asked me to do that.

513
00:37:11,266 --> 00:37:12,800
You want one of these?

514
00:37:13,033 --> 00:37:14,733
Jim looks kind of hungry.

515
00:37:18,066 --> 00:37:20,133
Can I talk about my lowest point?

516
00:37:22,966 --> 00:37:24,666
Well, so...

517
00:37:24,733 --> 00:37:28,733
about two years ago, I was standing
outside of Penn Station one night,

518
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:32,300
I had just gotten paid,
so I had money in my pocket.

519
00:37:32,566 --> 00:37:35,166
This guy comes up to me,
and he's like "you know what?"

520
00:37:35,866 --> 00:37:38,333
"I'll suck your dick for twenty bucks."

521
00:37:38,933 --> 00:37:41,933
I never had a guy suck my dick
before, but I figured you know...

522
00:37:42,233 --> 00:37:44,800
If you close your eyes,
a mouth's a mouth, right?

523
00:37:46,133 --> 00:37:48,733
So I'm like, "Alright cool,
where do we do this? Where do we go?"

524
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,566
We round halfway down the block.

525
00:37:51,966 --> 00:37:53,900
And I was worried about cops.

526
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,132
The guy just got down on his knees.

527
00:37:57,133 --> 00:37:59,500
Unzipped my pants, he started going for it.

528
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:01,766
He was terrible.

529
00:38:02,933 --> 00:38:04,933
This dude starts groaning.

530
00:38:07,666 --> 00:38:10,263
I'm like, "I thought I was
supposed to be having fun here."

531
00:38:10,264 --> 00:38:12,799
I don't see what the purpose of this is.

532
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,733
What I'm supposed to be paying for.

533
00:38:15,066 --> 00:38:17,899
And I don't know what happened,
it was an involuntary bodily reaction

534
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,566
I just kind of like, kneed a little bit

535
00:38:20,933 --> 00:38:23,666
and it was like wrestling,
he just like jumped back.

536
00:38:24,033 --> 00:38:27,533
He fell, and he hit his
head on the pavement.

537
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,766
And I think he started
bleeding, I saw some blood.

538
00:38:31,166 --> 00:38:35,000
And he started convulsing,
like he was possessed.

539
00:38:41,533 --> 00:38:44,933
He take his hand, back of mine

540
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,200
and he's looking,
and he's got blood on his hand.

541
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:13,833
Hey.

542
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,733
I got it.

543
00:39:20,466 --> 00:39:21,466
Hey.

544
00:39:48,033 --> 00:39:49,233
Fuck!

545
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,299
Fucking waste of my time, man.

546
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,232
This fucking,
I could go play music by myself.

547
00:39:53,233 --> 00:39:55,400
I don't need a fucking circle of clowns.

548
00:39:55,666 --> 00:39:58,000
If you're not gonna play,
then what's the fucking point?

549
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,800
Alright, just fucking play man.

550
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,266
Alright, alright.

551
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,740
Is this a group sing-along,
or is this a group sing-along?

552
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,833
- Let's not all sing.
- We'll sing.

553
00:40:30,033 --> 00:40:31,166
You weren't singing.

554
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,500
You guys, anyone think he
should be allowed to stay?

555
00:41:25,266 --> 00:41:26,966
- You do.
- Of course I do.

556
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:28,829
Okay. Does anybody else?

557
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:31,666
I would've liked to see him
get a second chance, yeah.

558
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:33,629
That's another yes. Okay.

559
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:36,066
Do you understand why he had to leave?

560
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,999
Cause he broke the rule.

561
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,366
He broke the rule,
but he also brought drugs...

562
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,159
I mean, beyond just being a
rule, he broke rule number one.

563
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,533
He brought drugs into a house,
when people are trying to avoid it.

564
00:41:45,534 --> 00:41:46,732
I think we're being selfish.

565
00:41:46,733 --> 00:41:48,925
There's somebody here
who's probably gonna be

566
00:41:48,955 --> 00:41:51,033
more affected by this than
anybody, right?

567
00:41:51,034 --> 00:41:53,066
- Yeah.
- Right? Your father?

568
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,833
How do you feel right now?

569
00:41:56,266 --> 00:41:59,033
How do you think I feel?

570
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,166
That's why I'm asking.

571
00:42:01,933 --> 00:42:03,466
Kevin's freed.

572
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,632
What do you mean, Kevin's free?

573
00:42:06,633 --> 00:42:08,630
That's what I mean, he's free.

574
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,333
He's made his choice.

575
00:42:12,266 --> 00:42:14,966
- Kevin made the choice?
- Kevin made a choice.

576
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:16,629
- Jim?
- Yes.

577
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,099
How do you feel about it?

578
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,166
- I feel sad that Kevin's gone, but...
- Thank you.

579
00:42:20,167 --> 00:42:22,266
I don't feel that he should be here.

580
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:24,399
But, at least you feel sad that

581
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,663
- I mean, things were better.
- We do not feel sad.

582
00:42:26,664 --> 00:42:30,200
I'm not saying we. He's a separate
person than you, is he not?

583
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:34,800
He's the owner of the house.
I'm asking him.

584
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,733
He's a separate entity.

585
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,429
You implied that others weren't sad
because Jim said that he was sad.

586
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:44,099
No, I did not.

587
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,533
Don't tell me what I implied.

588
00:42:45,534 --> 00:42:47,399
I didn't imply anything.

589
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,329
I'm just saying he's a sentimental guy.

590
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:52,199
He feels bad that Kevin's gone.

591
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,299
- Now, her father...
- If you're not sentimental, then say it.

592
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,729
"I feel sad" and then
continue the sentence.

593
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:01,065
You say, "We had good times two days ago."

594
00:43:01,066 --> 00:43:02,429
That's sentimental.

595
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:04,933
- Lucy, stop.
- Yeah, really.

596
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:06,933
Down boy.

597
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,999
I understand the idea
of being compassionate.

598
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,959
That's what I wanna talk about,
that's why I'm sad that Kevin's gone.

599
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,785
At the same time,
I'm no saying rule number one

600
00:43:13,815 --> 00:43:15,631
is the main thing about
what we're doing here.

601
00:43:15,632 --> 00:43:18,866
I think the house is mostly, I hope that
we don't revolve just around these rules.

602
00:43:18,867 --> 00:43:20,763
I hope that we can break
past, and we just see

603
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,333
that only thing in this house
is the rules and the structure.

604
00:43:23,433 --> 00:43:26,599
That said... call it whatever you want.

605
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,459
You can't bring drugs into this house.

606
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:29,999
If you do, you don't get to stay there.

607
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,866
I was very clear with everyone
here on day one that they got here.

608
00:43:34,166 --> 00:43:36,233
Right. So now he's gone.

609
00:43:37,433 --> 00:43:40,866
What if I bring a bunch of whores
in here and start fucking them?

610
00:43:40,966 --> 00:43:42,700
Is it the same thing?

611
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,033
I don't know.

612
00:43:45,166 --> 00:43:46,133
I don't know either.

613
00:43:46,134 --> 00:43:49,233
Yeah Lucy, how do you think about that?

614
00:43:49,533 --> 00:43:51,433
Bunch of whores in your house.

615
00:43:51,966 --> 00:43:53,866
Now it's my house?

616
00:43:55,033 --> 00:43:57,966
Well, you're "we" aren't you?

617
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,200
- You and Jim.
- I wasn't a few moments ago.

618
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,033
You're impossible.

619
00:44:05,266 --> 00:44:09,033
Jim, I love you, but I don't know where
you picked this chick up. I'm sorry.

620
00:44:12,033 --> 00:44:15,099
Get your fucking hands off me!

621
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,199
Make up your mind!

622
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,600
Get your hands off me.

623
00:44:17,666 --> 00:44:19,400
Is it my house or is it not my house?

624
00:44:20,966 --> 00:44:24,600
I'll snap you like a twig you little bitch.

625
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:28,666
Fuck.

626
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:30,533
You little whore.

627
00:44:41,433 --> 00:44:44,559
You think you can hurt me?

628
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,233
I can rip you into fucking pieces!

629
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:53,966
I don't care, I'm not gonna leave you!

630
00:44:53,967 --> 00:44:56,729
I'm not gonna fucking leave you!

631
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:59,000
You can't leave, you can't leave.

632
00:45:24,266 --> 00:45:26,500
Put it down, alright Lucy?

633
00:45:33,366 --> 00:45:37,033
It's a fucking butter knife.

634
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,933
Thanks.

635
00:47:37,666 --> 00:47:38,666
Hello?

636
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,165
Wait, who are you?

637
00:47:42,166 --> 00:47:42,466
This is Todd.
Wait, who are you?

638
00:47:42,466 --> 00:47:43,066
This is Todd.

639
00:47:43,067 --> 00:47:45,866
I'm calling on behalf of the
Wounded War Veteran's Foundation.

640
00:47:45,966 --> 00:47:49,463
I was wondering if you had just a second to
talk about making a small donation today?

641
00:47:49,464 --> 00:47:51,300
My sister-in-law's a wounded war veteran.

642
00:47:51,433 --> 00:47:52,933
I'm so sorry to hear that.

643
00:47:53,066 --> 00:47:55,333
Well then, you may be
interested in making a donation.

644
00:47:55,334 --> 00:47:57,759
You can do a flat rate now, or

645
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,073
you can make a donation
for twenty dollars...

646
00:47:59,133 --> 00:48:00,833
That sounds,
you know I have to speak quietly

647
00:48:00,834 --> 00:48:03,133
because my grandfather's
sleeping in the room next to me.

648
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:53,466
Hey, we're gonna take a little drive.
Can I get the van keys?

649
00:48:54,366 --> 00:48:56,566
- You can't take the van.
- Why?

650
00:48:56,866 --> 00:48:58,866
We're going grocery shopping.

651
00:48:59,833 --> 00:49:01,900
We can do the grocery shopping.

652
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:03,733
That's okay.

653
00:49:40,633 --> 00:49:41,633
Hey.

654
00:49:42,433 --> 00:49:43,566
Lucy.

655
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,900
Hey, how's it going?

656
00:49:46,533 --> 00:49:48,133
Lucy, this is my girlfriend Tracy.

657
00:49:48,134 --> 00:49:50,166
- Tracy, this is Lucy.
- Hey.

658
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:52,500
How you been? You look very good.

659
00:49:52,733 --> 00:49:54,900
All grown up, doing your shopping.

660
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,700
You look healthy.

661
00:50:00,933 --> 00:50:03,500
I've got Tracy here.
We've been together for six months.

662
00:50:03,966 --> 00:50:05,666
I say seven months, she says six months.

663
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,000
I figure the more the better though,
cause life's a dream with her.

664
00:50:08,033 --> 00:50:09,432
Let's get out of here.

665
00:50:09,433 --> 00:50:12,566
No, I'll just be a second.
Can you meet me over in the cereal aisle?

666
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,600
I need to pick up some Applejacks.

667
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,433
Lucy, what's it like, you know?

668
00:50:20,666 --> 00:50:22,233
Like, you go about doing
your everyday stuff.

669
00:50:22,234 --> 00:50:25,333
What's it like to be a truly
awful, horrible person?

670
00:50:25,466 --> 00:50:28,100
A despicable person.

671
00:50:29,066 --> 00:50:30,999
Lucy, look at me. Lucy.

672
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,133
You wouldn't give this to me earlier,
so look at me now. What's it like?

673
00:50:34,733 --> 00:50:37,099
How long did you think you'd go
without, without, without...

674
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,000
How long did you think you'd go, hey hey...

675
00:50:39,266 --> 00:50:41,333
You're in public. Don't make a scene.

676
00:50:41,433 --> 00:50:42,566
It's ugly.

677
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,566
Alright, look. Do the world a favor.

678
00:50:46,567 --> 00:50:48,433
Don't have children.

679
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:24,429
- Hi.
- Hi.

680
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:25,766
Hi Lucy.

681
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,000
How are you?

682
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:29,733
I'm fine.

683
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,800
Good.

684
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,100
What's going on?

685
00:51:38,633 --> 00:51:40,133
Well...

686
00:51:41,966 --> 00:51:44,366
I have some bad news.

687
00:51:48,066 --> 00:51:49,766
Kevin OD'ed...

688
00:51:50,266 --> 00:51:51,900
and he's gone.

689
00:51:52,533 --> 00:51:53,900
He died.

690
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:19,633
I'm sorry.

691
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,833
So, um...

692
00:56:32,033 --> 00:56:37,359
Kevin's ex-wife left me the information

693
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,366
about the funeral.

694
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:45,133
So, if you're interested
I have that information.

695
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:49,899
I was thinking that it made a
little bit more sense for us to

696
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:53,566
just have something here at the house.

697
00:56:53,733 --> 00:56:56,799
To sort of celebrate his life

698
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:02,066
rather than attending the actual
thing that she's putting together.

699
00:57:02,766 --> 00:57:04,233
Is Courtney gonna go?

700
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,100
I don't know.

701
00:57:06,633 --> 00:57:08,900
I would hope that she
would want to stay here.

702
00:57:10,366 --> 00:57:12,233
You know, Kevin got married in this house.

703
00:57:12,234 --> 00:57:16,299
It seems to make sense to have...
the funeral at the house.

704
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,666
If Courtney's gonna go, we should go.

705
00:57:21,633 --> 00:57:23,166
Alright, well...

706
00:57:23,633 --> 00:57:26,633
All of your are obviously
welcome to go to that.

707
00:57:26,634 --> 00:57:30,300
I will not be attending, and...

708
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,333
seems like we could do something
a little bit more productive here.

709
00:57:35,633 --> 00:57:37,866
That's a big decision to make for
her, though.

710
00:57:37,867 --> 00:57:39,666
I'm not making it for her.

711
00:57:39,733 --> 00:57:41,399
And I love that, you know this idea that

712
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,263
if she goes,
you will go there in solidarity.

713
00:57:43,264 --> 00:57:45,263
For me, I would think that at least one

714
00:57:45,264 --> 00:57:47,863
would hope more of you would
stay here and actually honor

715
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:50,063
the way that Kevin lived his life.

716
00:57:50,064 --> 00:57:51,199
Funerals are for the living.

717
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,233
You know, you go there to
support the people who are there.

718
00:57:53,234 --> 00:57:54,732
It's not about the guy who died.

719
00:57:54,733 --> 00:57:57,300
It's not about us.
It's about the people who need people.

720
00:57:57,433 --> 00:57:59,332
The people who need the support, right?

721
00:57:59,333 --> 00:58:01,963
Most people...
look, I've been through this already.

722
00:58:01,964 --> 00:58:04,299
When most people are down,
they see people they know,

723
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:06,833
they see people who care about
them, it lifts their spirits.

724
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,863
And I can remove myself enough
from my feelings for Kevin,

725
00:58:09,864 --> 00:58:11,259
from my feelings about funerals

726
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:13,299
to just be there for the
people who might need help.

727
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:15,800
Alright, alright. Do whatever you...

728
00:58:17,833 --> 00:58:21,033
I don't know why we're suddenly acting
like we're all this conventional people

729
00:58:21,034 --> 00:58:24,166
who have to do what they're supposed to...

730
00:58:24,566 --> 00:58:26,766
I'm just saying that I
thought that maybe...

731
00:58:26,767 --> 00:58:30,066
it's so surprising that um...

732
00:58:30,233 --> 00:58:33,463
- people are even really interested in...
- Well, we're not interested.

733
00:58:33,464 --> 00:58:35,399
The man died, you go to a funeral.

734
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,020
Nobody wants to go.

735
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:37,906
But, that's like the idea
of what you're supposed to do.

736
00:58:37,966 --> 00:58:40,733
- But, this is...
- Lucy, are you gonna go?

737
00:58:41,466 --> 00:58:42,466
Yeah.

738
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:58,766
We should've never kicked
him out of the house.

739
00:58:59,933 --> 00:59:02,733
Separated him from us as family.

740
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,333
Separated him from his daughter,

741
00:59:07,566 --> 00:59:10,500
and put him back out there
in the cold by himself.

742
00:59:12,666 --> 00:59:15,066
We should've tried to bring him back in.

743
00:59:17,366 --> 00:59:20,566
I would've wanted somebody
to help me come back in.

744
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:28,099
I think we did a bad thing.

745
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,233
We did a bad thing.

746
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:12,433
Thank you, Al.

747
01:01:12,566 --> 01:01:15,646
Those are the nicest words I've heard
out of your mouth since I've been here.

748
01:01:20,733 --> 01:01:22,866
Did anyone else hear Younger take a fart?

749
01:01:24,733 --> 01:01:26,066
I did.

750
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,663
And sometimes you get it.

751
01:01:28,664 --> 01:01:32,329
You wanna crack up at funerals,
but you're not supposed to.

752
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:34,726
And when he did that I was
like, oh my god I'm gonna lose it.

753
01:01:34,756 --> 01:01:35,564
Laughter's life.

754
01:01:35,565 --> 01:01:38,066
- Tears are a life from laughter.
- You're right, you're right.

755
01:01:38,067 --> 01:01:39,266
It's true.

756
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:43,000
Lucy, you're not worried?

757
01:01:44,566 --> 01:01:45,186
No.

758
01:01:45,216 --> 01:01:47,166
When's the last time you
pulled something like this?

759
01:01:48,233 --> 01:01:50,033
Do you know where Jim is, Courtney?

760
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:52,300
I don't know. I don't know where he is.

761
01:01:58,633 --> 01:02:00,133
I don't wanna throw up.

762
01:02:01,033 --> 01:02:02,666
I don't wanna throw it out.

763
01:02:02,966 --> 01:02:05,066
Are you bulimic, Courtney?

764
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:07,633
I don't know.

765
01:02:08,066 --> 01:02:11,100
I'm saying this in the best way possible.

766
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,766
Does she look like a bulimic person?

767
01:02:15,566 --> 01:02:17,166
I'm serious.

768
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:19,566
Don't take it personally.
I don't think girls should be skinny.

769
01:02:19,567 --> 01:02:21,433
I think the most important thing...

770
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:24,263
that you can seek in a
woman is enjoyment of food,

771
01:02:24,264 --> 01:02:26,566
because if you enjoy
food, you enjoy pleasure.

772
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:29,666
And if you enjoy pleasure,
I will enjoy your company.

773
01:04:04,533 --> 01:04:06,833
Courtney's trying to do a reenactment.

774
01:04:18,466 --> 01:04:20,133
I think Courtney needs...

775
01:04:51,166 --> 01:04:52,800
Fuck.

776
01:04:55,633 --> 01:04:56,466
Call 911.

777
01:04:56,467 --> 01:04:57,499
Someone get some milk.

778
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:58,733
We gotta let her stomach...

779
01:04:58,734 --> 01:05:00,799
Someone call an ambulance.

780
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,432
She fucking drank bleach.

781
01:05:02,433 --> 01:05:03,466
Is there any milk?

782
01:05:03,467 --> 01:05:05,700
- Yeah, yeah.
- Get some milk.

783
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,666
You're gonna be alright.

784
01:05:53,766 --> 01:05:56,266
Get the fuck off me!

785
01:06:50,366 --> 01:06:53,099
I was talking to uh... cause when
I was at bookclub I was thinking

786
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:55,732
we could also do a bookclub,
and that's gets like

787
01:06:55,733 --> 01:06:57,932
women love to read, cause you know

788
01:06:57,933 --> 01:07:00,029
the library, stuff like that, so if like

789
01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:01,299
I was thinking we could start a bookclub

790
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:04,066
and people will have to come to the
house, cause we'll all go to the party

791
01:07:04,067 --> 01:07:06,365
and, um...

792
01:07:06,366 --> 01:07:07,966
and we'll have food for them.

793
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:10,563
I'll have food for them,

794
01:07:10,564 --> 01:07:13,099
and it'll be like oh great you have food.

795
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:15,000
This is really nice.

796
01:07:15,166 --> 01:07:16,399
You know how to treat a girl.

797
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,833
And we'll be like, yeah we do, and we read.

798
01:07:19,133 --> 01:07:21,366
And they'll be like, oh that's amazing.

799
01:07:21,367 --> 01:07:22,799
I like you a lot.

800
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,799
I think that'll be really effective.

801
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,029
And like, it'll be really good.

802
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:30,900
We could read, um... what do girls read?
