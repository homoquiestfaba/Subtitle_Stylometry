1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:04,710
We have put together, I think the most

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,480
extensive and inclusive voter fraud

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:01:47,159
organization in the history of American politics.

4
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,859
Every time we vote, we are standing up side
by side with the founding fathers, with the

5
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:57,109
men of Valley Forge, with Patriots and pioneers
throughout our history, with all those who

6
00:01:57,109 --> 00:02:04,240
dedicated their lives to making this a nation
of the people, by the people, and for the people.

7
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,510
Elections are the lifeblood of our democracy.
They are the mechanism by which the American

8
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:16,280
people choose who is going to rule on their
behalf and for their interests and welfare.

9
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,750
Without elections, there would be no way for
the American people for us to exercise our

10
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:32,720
legitimate sway on the future direction of
this country.

11
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,570
Polls now closed in half the country and we
are getting some interesting results coming

12
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,320
in from those battleground states. If you're
a Republican, you say, wow, if you're a Democrat,

13
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,290
you say uh-oh. Do you see, Donald Trump is now
starting to widen his lead. President Trump,

14
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,410
now, with 54% of the vote, the President right
now has the lead in the Keystone State.

15
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:55,550
We're gonna have a great night and we're going
to have much more importantly, we have a great

16
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,400
four years.

17
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,480
The 2020 election haunts the American mind.
Here's where it gets really bizarre. At Fulton

18
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,960
County, most populous county. It is Atlanta.
They just stopped counting. Nevada, meanwhile,

19
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,300
has stopped counting votes. They've all stopped
counting for the night.

20
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:21,010
All right, welcome back. This is CNN special
live coverage 10:31 AM on the East Coast.

21
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:27,340
Why am I giving you the time? Well, if you
manage to sleep, last night things changed.

22
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,900
You may have gone to bed, thinking this election
was headed one way and then you woke up and

23
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,720
you saw things were different. Also overnight
Joe Biden pulled ahead in the state of Georgia.

24
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,001
Joe Biden takes the lead in Pennsylvania.
OK? We have an announcement to make. Joe Biden

25
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:45,000
has run for president three times. And the
third time

26
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,980
has turned out to be the charm.

27
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:55,100
One side insists it was the most secure election
in U.S. history. Let me begin with one immutable

28
00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:00,430
fact. The 2020 election was the most secure
election in American history. It was the cleanest

29
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:05,241
election, the safest election, the most secure
election ever run. And make no mistake, there

30
00:04:05,241 --> 00:04:11,560
has been no evidence of any significant wides
or widespread voter fraud. Let me say it again.

31
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:18,100
The 2020 election was the most secure election
in American history, period. This same side

32
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,820
accuses anyone who disagrees with them

33
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,630
of perpetrating a big lie or the big delusion.
The big Lie keeps getting repeated. The Big

34
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,080
Lie is just that. A big lie.

35
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,840
And despite a relentless media barrage, the
other side remains convinced there was widespread

36
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:43,660
election fraud. What I saw was not a secure
and transparent election. Poll watchers claimed

37
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,770
the Travis County Clerk's office is locking
them out. Last night there was a major software

38
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:53,560
glitch that actually delayed the counting
of all of the ballots. Look at election fraud

39
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,680
and I want to look at secretaries of state
who illegally changed the voter laws without

40
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,380
the permission of their state legislature.
There have been numerous

41
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:06,030
attempts to prove election fraud. The van
dropping off ballots in the early morning

42
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,770
hours of November 4th, 8 hours passed the
deadline. She said her mother was in a nursing

43
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:15,210
home and did not have the mental capacity
to vote. Even obtained videotape that shows

44
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,720
a man dropping several ballots into a Dropbox.
Scottsdale woman pleads guilty to casting

45
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:25,790
a ballot in her dead mother's name, ... shows
a man buying a registration form for an absentee

46
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:31,110
ballot from a voter giving him quote pocket
money unquote of $200.

47
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:36,910
Yet courts have refused to consider these
cases on the merits.

48
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:41,950
The Supreme Court rejecting an effort by Republicans
to reverse president elect Joe Biden's win

49
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:47,410
in Pennsylvania and the Supreme Court has
rejected the Texas led effort to toss out

50
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:54,270
election results in four key states. Even
some Republicans dismissed the idea of systematic

51
00:05:54,270 --> 00:06:01,220
fraud and call for us to move on. Fraud did
not play a role in the outcome of the election.

52
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:06,919
The election was fair as fair as we've seen.

53
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:13,190
We simply did not win the election as Republicans
for the Presidency. Rather than reject what

54
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:18,590
happened on the 6th, reject the lies about
the election and make clear that a President

55
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:22,240
who engaged in those activities can never
be President again.

56
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,290
But we can't move on unless we know the truth.

57
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,810
Many other issues arise out of the 2020 election.

58
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:39,490
Did the January 6 protesters go to DC to mount
an insurrection?

59
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:51,220
It wasn't an insurrection. It was a Primal
Scream.

60
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:58,340
They wanted their elected leaders to adjudicate
the claims of election fraud.

61
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:03,990
The left's claim that this was the most secure
election is also the foundation for the widespread

62
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:10,210
censorship on social media of the so called
"Big Lie." This morning, President Trump waking

63
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:16,270
up without his favorite megaphone. You will
never again see a tweet from President Trump.

64
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,650
But, is it a big lie?

65
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,711
Is it a lie at all?

66
00:07:19,711 --> 00:07:34,110
Yeah, sounds speed all right. Everybody got
me all right RP.

67
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:38,220
Grab that.

68
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,330
Ready. Set.

69
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:51,080
Hey, I'm Dinesh D'souza, and this is Season
One, Episode One, of my new podcast.

70
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:58,300
I started my podcast in early 2021 to speak
the truth, but by simply asking questions

71
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:04,120
about election fraud, you get booted from YouTube
and Facebook.

72
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:10,900
My podcast is sponsored by Salem Media and
I knew that other Salem hosts felt my frustration.

73
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:22,360
Larry Elder, Dennis Prager, Eric Metaxas, Sebastian
Gorka, Charlie Kirk.

74
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,900
Let me begin by asking a very simple question.
Do we feel confident or comfortable that we

75
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:34,199
know the truth about what really happened
in the 2020 election? I'm agnostic on this

76
00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:40,289
question and I am awaiting more information.
What about you, Eric? I think Dennis is a

77
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:41,289
coward.

78
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:46,970
I think, no. Honestly, it's almost funny to
me to say you're agnostic and I think most Americans

79
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,100
know.

80
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:54,529
that we don't know what happened, and are not
OK with that, by the way. I'm supposed to

81
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:59,770
believe that a man who didn't campaign or
campaign from his basement got more votes than

82
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,439
the first black president in America.

83
00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:07,509
I don't believe it. Charlie. We have crumbs.
We have some evidence here and there. That

84
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:11,670
the picture is far from complete. Larry, in
your race, you were, you were asked straight

85
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:17,660
out, right? Do you believe that the 2020 election
was stolen? What was your answer and do you

86
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:23,240
abide by that answer as of right now? My
answer was that

87
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:29,290
Donald Trump is in Mar-a-lago and Joe Biden
is in 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. The lawsuits

88
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:34,749
did not succeed, but do I believe there was
shenanigans? Do I believe there were irregularities?

89
00:09:34,749 --> 00:09:40,550
Absolutely! And I said so. This is the probably
the most loathed president I've ever seen.

90
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:44,660
I thought Richard Nixon was loathed. I thought
George W Bush was loast because of the Iraq

91
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,589
war. I've never seen the level of vitriol
against this man every single day. I think

92
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,089
there was a study that found 91% of the news

93
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:58,579
of ABC, NBC, CBS Nightly News against Donald
Trump was negative, dogged by a bogus 2 1/2

94
00:09:58,579 --> 00:10:04,029
year collusion investigation. And then on
the eve of the election, this Hunter Biden

95
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:08,420
story drops, which shows that Joe Biden completely
lied about his lack of knowledge of what his

96
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:13,540
son was doing. And it was suppressed. And
even the CEO of Twitter later on admitted

97
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,300
that it was suppressed and shouldn't have
been. That alone would have altered the election.

98
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,929
You add all that up. My point is, this man
is so loathed. I wouldn't put it past the Democrats

99
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:23,730
to do virtually anything to make sure

100
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:28,930
he doesn't get another four years. If I believed
the president were Nazi, I might steal an

101
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:33,910
election. If we were Germans in the 1930s,
we'd steal the election from Hitler. If if

102
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:39,079
I'm that indoctrinated, of course I can justify
it. I think it was Jane Fonda who said that

103
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:45,209
COVID was God's gift to the left, right? It
wrecks the empirical positives of the Trump

104
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:50,019
economy, but here's the other. It enables
a whole bunch of things on the other side

105
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:55,050
to change the rules of the election. So the
point is, under a COVID

106
00:10:55,050 --> 00:11:00,220
environment, is it not conceivable that Trump
could have lost fair and square? I think millions

107
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,129
of Americans know something went wrong.
They have little pieces. And no one's really

108
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:08,060
put it together. They know that there was
injustice. They know it in their gut. They

109
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,889
know it through the bellwether counties where
Donald Trump won almost every single one of

110
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:15,730
the predictive counties that show who's going
to be president. And then they also know it

111
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,700
where they went to bed thinking Trump was
going to have four more years and they woke

112
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:24,149
up with the exact opposite. We have an individual
who could fill a stadium with 60,000 supporters

113
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:29,880
in 24 hours. Vice an individual you know the
famous photograph of the six empty circles

114
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:36,589
at a Biden rally. We have an incumbent president
who received more votes than any other incumbent

115
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:42,459
President in American history, who actually
got 10 million more votes than he did four

116
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:48,189
years prior, and who received more support
after four years of being called a racist

117
00:11:48,189 --> 00:11:52,959
and a white supremacist. More support from
the Hispanic and Black community than any

118
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,489
Republican president since the 1960s.

119
00:11:56,489 --> 00:12:02,809
And he was beaten by a machine politician,
who couldn't speak clearly, who on the campaign

120
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:09,519
stage would confuse his sister with his wife?
It just stinks. Now is it possible that the

121
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,880
very success of Republicans down ballot... I'm
talking about Republicans running for the

122
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,999
house running for the Senate, running for other
races... the fact that the Republicans as a

123
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:20,290
party did pretty well?

124
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:26,160
But Trump lost. Doesn't that work the other
way and undercut the idea that there were

125
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:33,139
systematic frauds? So an anomaly? Because if he
really, when a president really loses, he

126
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:41,170
has tails. What is it called? "Coattails." Okay. And
and the the down ballots lose. But they won.

127
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:45,439
Why didn't they cheat on all of those? Why
didn't they cheat in Virginia with Youngkin?

128
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:49,939
But then who's to say they didn't cheat? Not
all attempts at cheating succeed.

129
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:55,920
You're right, another question. In the Republican
Party, I keep hearing people who seem annoyed

130
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:02,930
at the revisiting of the 2020 election. Their
attitude appears to be let bygones be bygones.

131
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:07,809
Let's just move on. I think the reason that
many Republicans are saying let's move on

132
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:10,410
is because,

133
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:15,480
bold accusations require bold evidence. And
they haven't seen it. And because they know

134
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,759
how vulnerable they are and how much they're
going to be bashed. You're you're called a

135
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:25,939
"sore loser." You're called a "conspiracy theorist."
The people who say that let's move forward,

136
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:33,259
are people in the elite, who see Donald Trump as
an anomaly. You will not win in any district

137
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:35,560
in this country,

138
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:42,860
because you have said that that the 2020 election
was a fraud. And if they can't win on this

139
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,450
issue, then don't use it.

140
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:49,189
Well, it doesn't have to be the only issue,
but they're unwillingness even to speak up

141
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:53,820
about it. I think is despicable. Show me the
proof and I'll bet you they do speak up. Just

142
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:59,699
like I will speak more and I'm not running
for office. But I have not gone on board of

143
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:03,319
I know for a fact this was a fraud. Show me
the money.

144
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:05,049
That's good.

145
00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:14,959
Look, I mean the Democrats. They have a history
of voter fraud. Going back to Tammany Hall

146
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:21,089
in the 19th century. We've fast forwarded to
LBJ, stealing his first race in Texas, John

147
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:27,260
F Kennedy. The allegations that he stole the
presidency with voter fraud in Texas and in

148
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:31,870
Illinois. They've done it before. I mean,
you can have someone who has a criminal record

149
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,240
and they're fully capable of robbing a bank.
But did they rob the bank? Well, it looks

150
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,240
like it. What is that

151
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,520
Frank Catherine think about all this. Catherine's
been a little quiet, but I think that that

152
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:46,329
means that they're working on something. I
think that you should give her a call and

153
00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:50,519
see what she thinks. I'm Catherine Englebrecht,
founder and president of True the vote.

154
00:14:50,519 --> 00:15:00,100
Hey, how are you? Hey I'm doing fine. Hey
listen, I'm here with Debbie. Hey Catherine,

155
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:05,949
hey Debbie. You know how crazy it is out there?
Have you guys been digging into this whole

156
00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:13,009
issue of voter fraud? Well we have been working
on something big. It's probably best we don't

157
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:16,999
discuss it over the phone, but can we meet?

158
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:25,370
I've been working with Greg Phillips. I don't
know if I've ever introduced him to you, but

159
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,160
he has a deep background in

160
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:35,759
election intelligence. He's worked projects
all over the world. These are massive. 30

161
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:36,759
year experience.

162
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:40,439
We decided to test a hypothesis and we went

163
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,439
really big.

164
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:42,989
And now you have something.

165
00:15:42,989 --> 00:15:46,619
That we think you're going to really want
to see.

166
00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:50,939
So I'll send you the address separately.

167
00:15:50,939 --> 00:15:57,089
Now, Greg Phillips. What's your background
that prepares you for this kind of work? I've

168
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:04,750
been in and around election intelligence and
integrity for about 40 years. We've done investigations

169
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:11,931
literally all over the world. It's a combination
of data acquisition, data analysis, occasionally

170
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:17,750
some in-depth data mining. Our ability to
draw meaningful conclusions that link the

171
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:21,699
who to the wind to the where is significant
in the space.

172
00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:28,009
Catherine, you started the group called True
the Vote in the year 2010. What was your mission

173
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:32,699
or objective? We just didn't have enough volunteers
working at the polls in our local elections.

174
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:36,850
So we began by training people to work in
the polls, and then as we got further into

175
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,660
it, we recognized wow, some of the problems
you see at the polls can be attributed to

176
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:45,269
problems in the voter rolls. Well, what can
we do about the voter rolls? And so it turned

177
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:49,220
into something much bigger than we had anticipated. True
the Vote has

178
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:55,769
the largest store of election intelligence
for the 2020 elections in the world. No one

179
00:16:55,769 --> 00:17:00,649
has more data than we do. So I started through
the vote to ensure that every American voter

180
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:06,470
has an opportunity to participate in elections.
I think I became familiar with your work when

181
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:12,650
you gave congressional testimony. And that
was in the year 2014. In fact, I met you through

182
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:17,429
Debbie. And I think what's interesting is
that you not only have known Debbie for years,

183
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:19,339
but you trained her. Absolutely.

184
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:25,560
I was I was a bilingual poll watcher. Oh yes,
so my my Spanish language came in very handy.

185
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:32,480
I was a poll watcher in Rosenberg and the
poll judge was telling this couple that came

186
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,399
in in Spanish who to vote for.

187
00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:41,710
And of course, she didn't really realize that
I knew Spanish, and so there we go. And you

188
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:47,480
busted. I busted. Yeah, so Catherine, when
you set up True the Vote, you set it up,

189
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:54,500
not so much. It's not a partisan organization.
Is that because you saw shenanigans, problems

190
00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:00,309
with voting as as coming out of both parties?
Oh. Absolutely. Plus we need parity of parties

191
00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:05,340
at the polls. Well, you told me about this
remarkable election in which you had vote

192
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,340
harvesting

193
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:12,909
and vote trafficking. But it was on behalf of
a Republican candidate exactly in North Carolina.

194
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:17,649
It was unique in that it actually overturned
an election. There's going to be a new election.

195
00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:22,470
North Carolina Congressional District engulfed
in a scandal over voting fraud. This all centers

196
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:30,080
around allegations that an operative for Harris
then hired a team of people to harvest absentee

197
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,610
ballots, paying them between 2:00 and $3 a
vote. So you have an activist. The guy's name

198
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:40,179
was Mccrae Dowless, and he worked for the
Bladen Improvement Association, which was

199
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:45,550
a kind of an African American get voters to
the polls, but apparently they were doing

200
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:50,010
all kinds of vote harvesting, and he learned
the strategy. Then he broke.

201
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:54,240
With them, and he took his services to Mark
Harris, a Republican was actually a pastor

202
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,450
who was running and Harris won. He pulled
it off in 40 years of doing this. We've seen

203
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:04,100
this over and over again. Sometimes the schemes
are a little bit different. Sometimes it's

204
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:09,160
people out banging on doors, gathering ballots.
Sometimes the ballots are sent here, gathered

205
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:15,350
here, deposited there, but the trafficking
itself is always the same basic pattern. There's

206
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:21,090
a nonprofit involved somewhere in the middle.
There are people that are either.

207
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:25,580
Collecting those ballots on the one hand,
or depositing those ballots on the other and

208
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:32,940
getting paid for it in no case is it is acceptable
to be paid for your ballot or to accept some

209
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:39,159
form of remuneration for your ballot, and
in no way in no time is that legal. I noticed

210
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:42,460
Catherine, that in the immediate aftermath
of the election, when there were a lot of

211
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:47,410
accusations and charges flying around, all
reflecting these suspicions of something when

212
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:51,360
deeply wrong charges of foreign intervention
charges of machines.

213
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,200
You and your organization were kind of dead
silent. I got the impression that you were

214
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:01,669
looking for a different approach given the
outliers that were introduced in in such a

215
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:08,360
major way in 2020, namely, the privately funded
dropboxes. The mass mail out of ballots. The

216
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,940
hypothesis was, if you were going to cheat,
how might one go about this? That would be

217
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:21,720
provable, trackable, traceable. You said there
might be some, let's just call them bad actors.

218
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:29,809
Who are delivering ballots systematically
and illicitly to these mail and drop boxes?

219
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:34,659
And there might be a way to track them and
to bust them. We didn't know we decided we're

220
00:20:34,659 --> 00:20:40,230
going to let the data tell the tale and we
collected together a team of highly skilled

221
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:46,690
contractors and put together a plan to see
where the data would take us.

222
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:54,620
What Greg is geotracking. So the idea is to
collect the signals that are emitted from

223
00:20:54,620 --> 00:21:00,139
your phone. Your cell phone is delivering
information to apps that are collecting that

224
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:06,440
ping. So there are four key coordinates. The
lat long, the elevation and the time.

225
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:12,290
And with that data we can then build a pattern
of life around you so that phones here right

226
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:15,940
now. Well, where is it going to be at 5:00
o'clock and where is it going to be tonight?

227
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,950
Well, here's my cell phone. My my cell phone
is off can you? Can I be Geo tracked even

228
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,759
with the cell phone being off possibly.

229
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:28,179
Depending on the apps that are on the marketing
companies do all day, every day. This is the

230
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:34,390
point we were just at the Apple Store and
CVS and then on both occasions they knew where

231
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:39,669
you were, evidently absolutely and they were
telling you about specials and they were so

232
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:45,750
people have experience of this. There's 300,000
or so apps that that gather that data and

233
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:50,259
then they sell it to brokers. Isn't it also
true that this geotracking has now become

234
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:53,270
a vital tool for the military?

235
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:58,440
For the intelligence agencies and for law
enforcement, indeed, there use in it almost

236
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:03,549
everyday. I'll say that there's no question
amongst anyone that I know in the Community

237
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:10,360
that many, if not all, of the people that
were involved in the situation at the Capitol

238
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:17,080
in January 6th we're being tracked previous
to January 6th because they already knew what

239
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:21,860
their pattern of life was. They already knew
who to look at. Many of the people who stormed

240
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,880
the US Capitol on January 6th.

241
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:29,009
Left digital footprints that law enforcement
has used in making arrests. You're saying

242
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:35,059
they must have known about these people before
because some of those guys were arrested one

243
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:42,910
day, three days, five days after January 6th,
and that's not enough time to do the geotracking

244
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:50,480
analysis. The very idea that you could go
from the afternoon of January 6th to acquiring

245
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,590
the data, tracking the data unmasked.

246
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:59,400
Who actually owns that phone, which the government
is required to do and then get it to a grand

247
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,180
jury? Make an arrest in 72 hours.

248
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:08,340
It's not, it's not possible. They had to have
been tracking the people in advance, but the

249
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:14,470
fact of the matter is these techniques are
used every single day by law, enforcement,

250
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:20,340
intelligence, community of the Department
of Defense was geotracking part of the way

251
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:26,230
that the CIA was able to identify bin Laden.
It certainly played a role. It's even more

252
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:32,769
sophisticated today than it was when Bin Laden
was disposed of. More and more apps are participating

253
00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:34,049
in this.

254
00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:38,519
Program if you will. The reliability of geotracking.

255
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:44,230
Is not substantially different from the reliability
of a fingerprint or the reliability of DNA.

256
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:49,059
If it identifies your phone now, I could have
given my phone to Debbie, but the simple truth

257
00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:55,200
of it is my phone was there on this particular
date and there's absolutely no question about

258
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:01,279
that right now. You decided to purchase through
these brokers that make this information available

259
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:07,399
to companies. They make it available all kinds
of places to buy data.

260
00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:13,029
Let's talk about the methodology you identified
data in certain places and by and large you

261
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:18,000
focused on the states where the election was
decided. Tell us what are the areas that you

262
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,149
bought data for and what were you looking
for and what's the time period. October 1st

263
00:24:23,149 --> 00:24:29,140
through the election in Georgia, we actually
bought from October 1st through January 6th

264
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:32,870
after the runoff. So we went in.

265
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:38,460
We decided to do the Atlanta metro area because
it picks up some rural areas. It picks up

266
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,930
some urban areas. It picks up some suburban
areas, 309 drop boxes in in the area, and

267
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:49,409
we thought, OK, well, this is a pretty good
test. We, in essence, sort of fenced around.

268
00:24:49,409 --> 00:24:58,190
Those geofencing and then we were able to
make purchase of data of people that had been

269
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:02,230
near those drop boxes, but also near the organizations.

270
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:08,149
As the country we bought 10 trillion signals
when they give you this data, this data that

271
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:13,169
you then have to go through. What does this
data look like? It's a massive data transfer.

272
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:18,450
We have more than a petabyte of data. You're
talking about transacting hundreds of terabytes,

273
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:23,720
so it's a significant move of data. You have
10 trillion signals. That's that's a lot of

274
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:29,909
signals. So what was the criterion that you
sat final decision? Was they had to have been

275
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:34,020
to 10 or more drop boxes, meaning unique visits
inside of a space?

276
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:38,710
And five or more visits to one of the one
or more of these organizations. Those were

277
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:43,000
the outliers. It was such an aberrant pattern.
So what you're saying, I mean, seems to me

278
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,330
there's no reason for someone to go to even
two drop boxes. But you're saying that maybe

279
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:52,620
there's a conceivable reason someone did that.
Let's identify a large number of drop boxes

280
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:58,519
and multiple trips, and that way we're going
to catch. Not all the offenders, right? But

281
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:04,009
the worst offenders, the way we would describe
it is we want to absolutely ensure that we

282
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:05,009
don't have.

283
00:26:05,009 --> 00:26:09,491
False positives, meaning, including people
that should not have been included. We're

284
00:26:09,491 --> 00:26:16,519
not in any way saying that this is all there
is. We're just saying that based on our criteria.

285
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:25,169
That we identified in the blana 242 people
that went to an average of 24 drop boxes.

286
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:31,860
In eight organizations, during a two week
period 242.

287
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,769
Mules now let's pause for a second.

288
00:26:34,769 --> 00:26:39,889
What is a mule? When we started the project,
we had to figure out how are we going to describe

289
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:46,000
the individuals and the and the elements involved
and to us it felt a lot like a cartel. It

290
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,889
felt a lot like trafficking and it can be
trafficking in drugs, trafficking in humans.

291
00:26:51,889 --> 00:26:56,539
In this instance, it's ballot trafficking.
And so we began to use that vernacular. A

292
00:26:56,539 --> 00:27:03,510
mule is, by our definition, a person that
is involved in picking up ballots from locations

293
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:09,029
and running them to the drop boxes. So you
have the collectors on the one hand, you have

294
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:14,049
the stash houses, which are the the nonprofits,
and then you have the the mules that are doing

295
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:19,100
the drops. What do we know about them? Who
are they? Well, first, let me say this is

296
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,009
not grandma out walking her dog bad backgrounds.

297
00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:26,890
Our reputations we've had, you know, encounters
with several that are, you know, not terribly

298
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:33,950
positive violent guys can be. They are interested
in one thing. That's money, by the way, how

299
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:39,049
much they get paid according to the people
that have shared information with us, it's

300
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:45,529
generally $10 a ballot in the in the Georgia
runoff, that number was higher.

301
00:27:45,529 --> 00:27:53,170
2020, of course, was the year of the Antifa
riots. The B LM riots, and it was all going

302
00:27:53,170 --> 00:28:00,220
on in the months and weeks leading up to the
election, and so in the data you have Geo

303
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,009
tracking data of the dropboxes.

304
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:10,919
But you also have data on the rioters. There
were several different violent BLM Antifa

305
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:15,799
riots in Atlanta, and one of them we had three
dozen of our mules participate in these violent

306
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:24,149
riots. There's an organization that tracks
the device ID's across all violent protests

307
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:31,049
around the world. We took a look at our 242
mules in Atlanta, and sure enough, dozens

308
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:33,090
and dozens and dozens.

309
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:39,159
Of our mules show up on the acrid databases,
so again, this is not a grandma I walking

310
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:43,730
her dog. These are, you know, violent criminals
sometimes not just a criminal element, but

311
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:47,441
there is an ideological element and that there's
an overlap between people. I mean, you're

312
00:28:47,441 --> 00:28:52,659
not going to go to an Antifa riot and find
it overpopulated with Patriots or Christians

313
00:28:52,659 --> 00:28:59,330
or Republicans. These are people on generally
the far left, and it turns out that these

314
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:03,970
are people who also helped to make up the
mule population. I think that's also.

315
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:09,539
Borne out in our target organizations themselves.
They're not like Republican organizations.

316
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:14,690
You're left wing Democratic organizations?
Yeah, let's zoom in here so the mule is the

317
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:20,480
delivery man woman and what you're saying
is they have a starting point or multiple

318
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,929
starting points. And then they have the end
point and the end point is the drop box, right?

319
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:30,399
But you're saying that they're they. They
get the ballots from somewhere and then they

320
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,820
go deposit them in multiple drop boxes.

321
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,880
The questions that will come up in the work
that we've done is, well, how do you know

322
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,299
that this wasn't just somebody that's got
a big family and they just deposited a bunch

323
00:29:40,299 --> 00:29:44,700
of ballots, ones? Or how do you know that
this person didn't just work at A at a location

324
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,929
that is near Dropbox, and so they're constantly
going by a Dropbox and the elements that that

325
00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:54,860
are additive? Here the going to the nonprofits.
The ability to identify the pattern of approach

326
00:29:54,860 --> 00:30:00,030
to a Dropbox and that it is going not past
a Dropbox and on but directly to a Dropbox

327
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:04,470
and back to another point and then to another
Dropbox. All of these things.

328
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:09,139
I mean, isn't the timing significant of some
guys going to a Dropbox at 2:00 AM in the

329
00:30:09,139 --> 00:30:14,860
morning? Presumably he's not like out for
a walk, so we're going to show you a visual,

330
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:19,360
a pattern of life that someone can see and
look at rather than just a whole spreadsheet

331
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,480
of numbers. Being able to look at it in this
manner.

332
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:30,210
What you see here on the screen is a single
person on a single day in Atlanta, GA. They

333
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:34,620
went to 28 drop boxes and five organization.

334
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:39,850
In one day, what are the orange dots? Those
are dropboxes.

335
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:45,820
And what is the blue tracks? That is a smoothed
out pattern of life so that we could take

336
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:51,870
the sort of the movement of the individual
cell phone signals, marry them together into

337
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:56,999
something that's visual so that you can see
movement on the individual to get to some

338
00:30:56,999 --> 00:31:02,690
of these drop boxes, you had to be intentional.
You had to get off the highway. You had to

339
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:08,299
go on surface streets, you had to turn in
somewhere in order to get to those drop boxes.

340
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:10,600
And the circles I take it reflect.

341
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:15,860
The nonprofit centers are that the places
where the ballots originate, the stash houses

342
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:21,539
where the ballots are collected and handed
to the mules to take to the Dropbox. Now let's

343
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:27,950
move over to Arizona. How many meals in Arizona?
A little over 200 little over 200. In Phoenix

344
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:33,830
alone. The reason I think this is all very
significant is because these were very close

345
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,580
states, right? What was the margin in Georgia?

346
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:45,350
10 or 11,000 I think in the end in Arizona.
Also extremely close close. Then you moved

347
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:51,330
on to Wisconsin, but our initial look was
in Milwaukee. Gross numbers were a little

348
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:56,190
down, but the average number of visits to
the drop boxes was up as soon instead of having

349
00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:01,970
only 24 unique visits. I think we averaged
28. Maybe I've heard people in Milwaukee are

350
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:06,950
really hard working and maybe they just went
overtime and then let's go to Michigan.

351
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:13,980
500 meals that we've identified in Michigan.
Again, the number of boxes is lower than where

352
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:20,509
in Michigan. Detroit mainly, but we have people
in Detroit that went to more than 100.

353
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:27,299
Dropboxes, I mean this is stunning because
it's like I cannot think of a rational kind

354
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:32,620
of innocent reason for someone to do that.
It just doesn't exist. So any reasonable person

355
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:37,460
would say you're on to something big. You
should take a closer look. Let's go to Pennsylvania

356
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:42,820
critical state. I think it was Pennsylvania
that really gave Biden the election Philadelphia

357
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:48,100
alone. We've identified more than 1100.

358
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:53,360
Newells at rates well beyond anything we'd
seen.

359
00:32:53,360 --> 00:33:01,159
Closer to 50 dropboxes each, each guy going
to 50 dropboxes each. 1100 we saw people driving

360
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:06,139
back and forth to New Jersey across the bridge
saying the ballots may not even be from Philadelphia

361
00:33:06,139 --> 00:33:08,770
or from Pennsylvania.

362
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:12,190
The origin point appears to be jersey.

363
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:18,730
Now running 1100 meals times 50 where we are
50,000 Dropbox visits by the mules alone in

364
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:25,970
Philadelphia or Greater Philadelphia area.
Now as you were assessing this data, you had

365
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,389
the two of you and I'm not sure which of you.

366
00:33:28,389 --> 00:33:33,559
Came up with this a genius idea in my view,
for it was you.

367
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:44,619
Of course, 2 hours. Well to validate your
data, we chose to look at 2 murders that were

368
00:33:44,619 --> 00:33:50,770
ebbing on cold case status and in Atlanta,
8 year old succoria Turner was killed by rounds

369
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:56,309
of gunfire shot into a car that happened just
outside this Wendy's parking lot, bought the

370
00:33:56,309 --> 00:34:03,070
data and the team got to work. You could see
visually that there were only a handful of

371
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,070
unique devices.

372
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:10,320
That could possibly have pulled the trigger,
so this is the area and this is where the

373
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:17,080
Wendy's was. And are you saying that each
green dot is the same guy, but moving through

374
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,350
time, each color is one person?

375
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:25,230
The shooting actually occurred right here
in this parking lot. Sort of inside of this

376
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:32,360
circle, or really the only potentially legitimate
shooters. Each of these devices has a unique

377
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:39,040
device ID, and we turned the bulk of this
information over to the Federal Bureau of

378
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,130
Investigation. Now I read they've arrested
two suspects. They have two suspected gang

379
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:48,340
members will appear in court this morning
on charges that include the shooting death

380
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,940
of eight year old Succoria Turner.

381
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:55,929
And isn't it true that this tracking these
movements this parallel is exactly the work

382
00:34:55,929 --> 00:35:02,190
you're doing with the mules exactly? It's
one thing to have the scientific evidence

383
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:07,740
which is persuasive on its own merits. But
do you have video evidence?

384
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:14,200
We do how much of it do you have? 4,000,000
minutes of surveillance video around the country

385
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:20,450
officials surveillance video of these male
in drop boxes.

386
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,200
How do you get it?

387
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:27,980
You can file for open records requests. Any
citizen can do this. It was a a very difficult

388
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:33,270
series of steps that had to be followed to
procure the actual surveillance video. You

389
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:40,000
have video in Georgia we do. Is it video from
the presidential election, the runoff election,

390
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,820
or both? Both? Do you have video from other
states? Some video from Arizona we have recently

391
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:52,670
learned video was specifically turned off
on particular drop boxes, in which state?

392
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:58,810
Arizona, Wisconsin. It turns out even though
the rules required them to have video, did

393
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:05,000
they do the video they did not. There should
be video on every Dropbox given today's kind

394
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,910
of cost of technology, it would not have been
that hard to do it. And you sent me a screenshot,

395
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:14,420
Catherine where you were requesting video
and I believe it was the state of Georgia

396
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:20,170
saying this video does not exist and we can't
tell you why it doesn't exist, right? That

397
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:22,090
was in in Fulton County.

398
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:27,420
Have correspondence like that from a lot of
states in the absence of video and that geospatial

399
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:33,130
data is key to decoding. You know what the
greater scheme was, but in the case of what

400
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:36,840
we're going to show you now what kicks it
up a notch is that we have the geospatial

401
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:41,880
data to support the video. Let's talk about
some of the videos, so we're going to show

402
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,830
you a couple different ones. This particular
individual we have in a number of different

403
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:50,950
locations and a number of different times.
He's actually a mule.

404
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:57,240
This is the official surveillance video of
Georgia, absolutely. And so as the person

405
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:01,760
pulls up, they don't even bother parking.
Of course, in the middle of the night. So

406
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,820
why would they? They gets out.

407
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,220
Approaches the box.

408
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:12,810
When people walk up with intention to cheat,
they look around. They basically walk fairly

409
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:16,100
quickly. They try to stuff them in. They try
to get out of there. In this case he drops

410
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,330
a few on the ground.

411
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:22,000
Pick them up, stuff them into the box.

412
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:29,380
And then he hustles back and hustles out of
there. So this is what it looks like. It doesn't

413
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:34,590
necessarily look like you know hundreds of
ballots being stuffed in. You don't need a

414
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:37,900
whole lot of fraud, just need a little in
the right places over time. Is there a way

415
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:43,850
to estimate or even roughly how many ballots
are being tossed into a box at a given time?

416
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:48,860
It might be three or five or six or ten or
something like that. The idea is to stay under

417
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:54,700
the radar, and as Greg said, the number is,
you know three 5-10 ballots, but then.

418
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:59,160
They're not done for the day either. They're
going place to place to place day upon day

419
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:04,680
upon day, and so that will not show up in
your chain of custody documents. You're tracking

420
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,820
documents that would identify a big blip,
and I mean they're not going up and dumping

421
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:15,480
in, you know, buckets full of ballots. On
the other hand, we've seen circumstances where

422
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:22,970
it appears that buckets full of ballots showed
up. There's one box in Gwinnett County that

423
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:25,330
had a chain of custody.

424
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:31,500
Document with 19162 ballots noted on this
and first of all, that's roughly 10 times

425
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,820
what we normally see.

426
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:39,790
We sorted through the geodata found a few
100 people OK, well, that's pretty odd. We

427
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,680
have video of all of this.

428
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,960
And guess what, it shows.

429
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:52,780
271 people approached that ballot drop box
during that 25 hour period.

430
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:59,060
271 nineteen 162 ballots were deposited.

431
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:06,870
Here are our election officials pulling out
of that drop box. 2 full duffel bags containing

432
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,370
over 1900 ballots.

433
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:15,150
Let's look at another one. Let's take a look
at the interesting thing about this person

434
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:22,650
is the device seems to live in South Carolina,
so this person isn't even from Georgia. She

435
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:28,050
was here during both election cycles, but
is not a resident of the state.

436
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:31,120
But as she approaches the drop box.

437
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:35,610
She never looks at the trash can, right? She's
looking the other way, but the other thing

438
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:38,660
she has is she has gloves on.

439
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:45,220
What one of our analysts noticed was these
surgical gloves only appeared from December

440
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:51,580
23rd forward in the runoff, so we didn't see
a lot of them previous to December 23rd, and

441
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:57,600
we couldn't figure out why. And then it just
dawned on us. Well on December 22nd.

442
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:03,120
There was an indictment handed down in Arizona
for people that had stuffed ballots and the

443
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:10,280
way the FBI nailed them was fingerprints and
then lo and behold, the next day and and days

444
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:15,850
forward. So this video is now from the Georgia
runoff. This is January of 21. This particular

445
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:20,740
one is approximately 1:00 o'clock in the morning
on January the 5th.

446
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:26,970
It's like a small stack ish, maybe 3, maybe
4 takes them off.

447
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:30,680
And then puts them in the trash can that she
never looked at.

448
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:35,310
So she knew it was there, knew it was there,
right? And so we have her on a number of locations

449
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:40,530
building out of state mule. And then this
is in no way the only Dropbox that she attended.

450
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:43,160
That's right. No, she's she's.

451
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:47,150
Goes to dozens and dozens over the course
of these two elections.

452
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:54,240
What you're going to see is he approaches
the drop box on his bike. He also has a backpack

453
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,630
on. Pull the ballots out of his backpack.

454
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:03,990
This time digging around, looking for some
ballots. Finally gets that pulls them out.

455
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:09,100
OK. Now I'm set and he'll put them in.

456
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:14,850
But you also see him get sort of frustrated
as he starts to leave, because guess what?

457
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:20,470
At this point, they had started requiring
the mules apparently to take pictures of the

458
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:26,230
stuffing of the ballots. It appears that that's
how they get paid, so they take a picture

459
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:30,260
and stuff it in. They take a picture, not
a selfie, but a picture of the the actual

460
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:36,410
ballot going in. But this guy gets frustrated,
so he actually has to park his bike, get off.

461
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:40,660
So if you were there, just casting your own
ballot, what reason in the world would you

462
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:45,140
have to come back and take a picture of the
box?

463
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:48,770
Many meals down looking around.

464
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:56,640
Take some pictures. OK the next one yeah.
So let me show you dog guy. So dog guy middle

465
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:01,680
of the day. This is actually at a polling
place so the people in line are waiting to

466
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:06,840
go in and vote early. They're doing it the
right way. OK, now you've got some other people

467
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,150
going to walk up.

468
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:14,490
This lady doesn't care, but this guy this
next guy cared he's watching the whole thing.

469
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:19,930
This guy looks up talks to him, got the ballots
under his arm already. Now he's got the rest

470
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:21,550
that he pulled out of the bag.

471
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:26,330
And he's going to get his camera ready to
take the pictures as he puts him in there.

472
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:30,820
If you consider the brazenness of this right,
this is the middle of the day. There's people

473
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:34,310
sitting there watching you cheat.

474
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:35,980
People that are doing it the right way.

475
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:41,450
But it's difficult for them to know what to
do except observe and maybe say what's going

476
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:45,940
on here. What did I just see? They wonder
what does this all even mean? If this is happening

477
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:49,880
in broad daylight and nobody's doing anything
to stop it.

478
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:57,680
And so these are the kind of things. 4,000,000
minutes of this. This was an organized effort

479
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:03,640
to subvert a free and fair election. This
is organized crime. You can't look at this

480
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,010
data in its aggregate.

481
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:09,080
And believe anything otherwise.

482
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:14,450
That's especially true when you consider that
in places like Georgia it was only decided

483
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:18,040
by 10,012 thousand votes.

484
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:24,630
And you look at 5000 visits just from our
mules.

485
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:27,160
It's not a leap.

486
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:34,420
To say yes, this would have made a difference.
Adding these numbers up, we have 2000 plus

487
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:41,160
mules based upon not searching these whole
States and remember we're only talking about

488
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,930
a small number of states you didn't. We're
not talking about the whole country, we're

489
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:48,230
talking about whole states. We're not even
talking about whole states. That's right.

490
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:53,130
And we're also talking about a gross undercount
of the actual number of meals, because you

491
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:57,040
set a high bar, they had to go to a 10 drop
boxes.

492
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,440
So if there's a mule who went to seven drop
boxes, you wouldn't. You wouldn't catch that

493
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:04,800
guy, and they had to go to nonprofits, so
they had to meet those two criteria and then

494
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,920
go to one of the geofence drop boxes. If they
met the two criteria but went to a post office

495
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,860
box, we're not going to look at them. One
of the slogans of the Democrats through all

496
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:22,300
this debate has been make every vote count,
and I think we can now see in a chilling way

497
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:27,210
that this is kind of what they mean. What
they mean is it doesn't matter if all.

498
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:32,950
Kinds of illegal ballots are being dropped
in. Let's just count them. Now the narrative

499
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:37,410
needs to be that this is the most secure election.
This is the most fabulous election we've ever

500
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:43,560
had pay no mind to the millions of Americans
that are saying something is not right. This

501
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:48,150
does not make sense. Nothing to see here,
just smile and wave boys. I mean, wouldn't

502
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:53,420
it be an accurate summary to say that these
voter bills that the Democrats are desperate

503
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:57,550
to enact the federalize? The election? Isn't
it that they want to take all these?

504
00:44:57,550 --> 00:45:02,890
Special provisions that have enabled what
we've described or you've described in the

505
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:08,100
2020 election and make it permanent if we
don't wake up.

506
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:12,990
And do the hard roll up your sleeves work
that it's going to take to reel this all back

507
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:17,830
together? Then yes, all the pieces are in
place for our election system to be in permanent

508
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:22,890
lockdown and it will be done under the watchful
eye of a media that will tell you it's all

509
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:29,980
just fine. It seems like they are subverting
democracy in the public pretense of protecting

510
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:37,810
it absolutely, and it won't stop unless we
stop it. If I look across the swath of Republicans.

511
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:41,910
This is not the kind of issue that they seem
to be comfortable with. It's almost like they

512
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:49,510
would rather endure. As I said, it's a gamble
right? Because the ones that are enduring

513
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:55,390
are currently elected and in power. When you
watch these brazen acts.

514
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:58,980
And nobody says a word because they're scared
that they're going to be sued because they're

515
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:01,800
scared that they're going to be cancelled
because they're scared that they're going

516
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:07,440
to be silenced. That kind of chilling effect
is exactly what they want. And as I said,

517
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,270
on the other side of fear is freedom. If you
never get past the fear.

518
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,680
You're never free.

519
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,060
Let's sum up what we know.

520
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:24,270
Do we know for sure that this was not in fact
far from the most secure election in history?

521
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:26,240
It was not.

522
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:33,070
We know that for a fact, do we know for a
fact that there was coordinated systematic

523
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:38,700
fraud in all the key states where the election
was decided?

524
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,230
Yes.

525
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:42,630
And therefore does it follow?

526
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:48,130
That the people who suspected fraud, even
though they didn't have the proof. Their suspicion

527
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:53,151
was right. Absolutely their instincts are
right, and moreover that the states that are

528
00:46:53,151 --> 00:46:59,610
trying to do something about systematic fraud
by restoring a modicum of, let's call it the

529
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:05,360
old rules, checking your voter ID, checking
signatures you want to mail in ballot. You

530
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,651
know what you got. To request an absentee
ballot. We're not going to send 20 million

531
00:47:08,651 --> 00:47:12,310
ballots out there and see what comes back
that these voter integrity.

532
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:15,290
As far from being voter suppression.

533
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:20,970
Are actually a legitimate way to make sure
that the people who vote are actually eligible

534
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:42,570
to vote 100% accurate. That's absolutely correct.

535
00:47:42,570 --> 00:48:07,630
What you are seeing is a crime. These are
fraudulent votes. In two of our five key states,

536
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:13,620
you were allowed to give your ballot to be
delivered by a family member or a caregiver.

537
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:19,310
This is vote harvesting, but it's not the
same as ballot trafficking. In no state in

538
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:25,920
America is it legal for nonprofit organizations
to collect ballots and pay mules to deliver

539
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:35,010
them to mail in drop boxes.

540
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:40,040
Now we come to the most important question
of all was the magnitude of vote trafficking

541
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:47,050
and these key swing states enough to tip the
balance in the 2020 presidential election?

542
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:55,650
Let's first narrow in on just our 2000 mules,
their average number of Dropbox visits 38

543
00:48:55,650 --> 00:49:01,510
their average number of illegal ballots deposited
per visit five. That's 300.

544
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:04,050
80,000 illegal votes.

545
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:08,730
But was this sufficient to put Biden in the
White House? To answer that question, we must

546
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:10,900
look at each key state.

547
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,960
In Michigan.

548
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:23,190
500 mules, averaging 50 Dropbox visits and
five illegal ballots per drop. That's 125,000

549
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:28,780
illegally trafficked votes, not quite the
154,000 vote difference between Trump and

550
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:36,330
Biden. So Michigan, with its 16 electoral
votes, stays in the Biden column in Wisconsin.

551
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:44,370
100 mules, averaging 28 drop box visits, and
five illegal ballots per drop. That's 14.

552
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:51,090
1000 illegally trafficked votes 6000 votes
short to give Trump the win. So using only

553
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:58,210
our mules Wisconsin, 10 electoral votes stays
in the Biden camp. But now we come to Georgia

554
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:07,570
250 mules, averaging 24 drop box visits and
five illegal ballots per drop. That's 30,000

555
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:13,200
illegally trafficked votes, far more than
the 12,000 vote difference between Trump and

556
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,280
Biden, so Georgia.

557
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:19,610
At 16 electoral votes moves over into the
Trump column.

558
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:25,900
In Arizona, the numbers are roughly the same,
200 mules, averaging 20 Dropbox visits and

559
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:31,610
five illegal ballots per drop. That's 20,000
illegal votes. Again, these illegal votes

560
00:50:31,610 --> 00:50:40,020
are substantially more than the 10,000 vote
margin that gave the States 11 electoral votes.

561
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:47,330
Dividen in Philadelphia, PA alone, 1100 mules,
averaging 50 Dropbox visits and five ballots

562
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:49,640
per visit, that's 275.

563
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:57,260
1000 illegal votes again comfortably exceeding
the 80,000 vote margin between Trump and Biden.

564
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:02,170
So Pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes goes
for Trump.

565
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:09,140
Shockingly, even this narrow way of looking
at just our 2000 mules in these swing states

566
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:16,980
gives Trump the win with 279 electoral votes
to Biden's 259.

567
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:22,820
But no one thinks that our 2000 mules were
the only mules trafficking illegal votes to

568
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:28,720
widen the search. Greg and his team lowered
the criterion from 10 or more to five or more

569
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:36,460
dropboxes. This revealed a huge upsurge in
the number of meals from 2000 to 54,000 fifty

570
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:42,870
4000 mules. Next they used a very conservative
estimate of just three ballots per Dropbox

571
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:44,310
visit.

572
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:49,780
Now when we multiply this increase number
of mules times the five Dropbox visits per

573
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:56,710
mule, times just three illegal votes per drop.
We find election fraud on an astonishing scale

574
00:51:56,710 --> 00:52:06,170
in Wisconsin, eighty 3565 illegal votes were
trafficked in Georgia, 92,670 in Pennsylvania

575
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:09,030
200 and 9505.

576
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:18,560
In Michigan, 226,590 and in Arizona 200 and
7435.

577
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:23,710
Using this calculus, Trump would have won
all the key States and the final electoral

578
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:29,010
vote 305 to 233.

579
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:33,400
I wanted to get my Salem colleagues take on
what I'd learned here.

580
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:38,200
How did you get this?

581
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:44,910
Surveillance fully, it's just like official
statistics.

582
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:49,910
This is all together to open records and the
way that we.

583
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:59,470
There was 4,000,000 minutes of video, so this
is official surveillance footage. That's indisputable.

584
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:04,280
It was taken by the state itself. That's the
only place that the I think did not anticipate

585
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:09,231
that anyone would go through this video, so
this is 1:00 o'clock in the morning. Don't

586
00:53:09,231 --> 00:53:13,510
we all vote at 1:00 o'clock in the morning?

587
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:18,250
Right, this is theme silly, but somebody asked
me they go, how do we know this is not normal

588
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:24,320
male? This is a ballot drop box, right? OK,
this is not the mailbox where we write your

589
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,320
mom.

590
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:29,870
She's got gloves, though. She's got gloves
on.

591
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:35,150
And what does she do with the clothes whoopsie
Daisy? Hang on? She walked straight past that

592
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:37,420
cannon. Didn't you gonna show that again?
It's hilarious.

593
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:42,250
Look, look, she just walks.

594
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:46,810
So this is not the first time she's done no,
but so that one was in Georgia. Is that right?

595
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:51,740
Yes, so in Georgia it is illegal to turn in
anyone but yourself or your family members

596
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:56,400
ballot. It is illegal, it is illegal. So forget
the outcome. That's an illegal practice. What

597
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:04,120
you just saw video number two dog. This is
called dog guy.

598
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:10,230
He's taking pictures.

599
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:16,540
Why would you do that? So you get paid? Paid
business is business. What do you? What do

600
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:21,010
you suspect? If if you had actually caught
this person at that moment, hand me those

601
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:26,420
ballots and the person did, what do you think
you would see? Whose name is on it in, in

602
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:31,240
your opinion, ineligible voters, people that
have moved. Would you see legitimate ballots?

603
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:34,910
There's an ambiguity in what you're saying.
The ballot itself is legitimate. That right?

604
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:39,680
It's not. It's not a fake piece of paper,
right? But again, remember when you mail in

605
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,600
a ballot, you have a security.

606
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:45,700
Envelope with the signature verification standard.
That's been all but washed away and as soon

607
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:48,250
as it's taken out of that envelope.

608
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:52,310
Then you then you have a disconnect and the
ballot is a virgin sheet of paper. The ballot,

609
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:55,540
the only ID, is on the envelope on the outside.

610
00:54:55,540 --> 00:55:02,090
But this is an example of multiple ballots,
so this is not 57 AM prime voting time. Gotta

611
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:06,720
be the line this person comes up and what
you're gonna see is when you try to put too

612
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,710
many ballots in.

613
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:16,780
He needs a shoe horn.

614
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:20,430
And we have lots of those where they're just
jamming them in, and then they fall on the

615
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:23,700
ground. And when you can jam this alone.

616
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:32,030
Is to say the least, suggestive. Who voting
at 3:57 AM with a whole bunch of ballots and

617
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:36,840
then being able to match that ping where he's
standing there to the next place he goes and

618
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:45,420
the next videos of 1, but each one of these
you know, went to on average 23 times going

619
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:47,350
different places.

620
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:54,881
571 night this person, this mule went across
6 counties to 27 different drop boxes. Five

621
00:55:54,881 --> 00:55:59,620
different organizations in, one in, one in
the ballots from the organization, correct,

622
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:04,670
the Republicans had no idea this was going
on during the election. Trump, to his credit,

623
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:08,900
tweeted out in July. Mail in ballots are a
disaster with and he was attacked so hard

624
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:12,740
by Kemp and Ducey and somewhere. But that
was he didn't have this information obviously

625
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:18,900
ended up being right. This is the tip of the
iceberg. You're talking about, extraordinary.

626
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:23,520
Criminal activity, but there's a ton more.
You would guess that you have not even touched.

627
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:30,480
You are talking about two 300,000 ballots
that were just harvested in only the old geolocated

628
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:36,670
locations, but you are talking what 5% of
America, less than 5%? OK, so the case closed.

629
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:43,160
Sorry, gentlemen. Lady Case closed, so I do
a heroic thing that not necessarily others

630
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:47,010
here. Do I read the New York Times every day
and.

631
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:55,980
No sorry for it, it's my martyrdom. They claim
all of these places we have found maybe 4,

632
00:56:55,980 --> 00:57:03,110
maybe 50 phony ballots. These aren't phony
ballots. This is a very long wait. They're

633
00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:04,160
phony names.

634
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:11,010
There's no name on the ballot, Dennis, OK,
let's say we got access to every single ballot

635
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:17,930
thrown into the ballot boxes. Would we be
able to prove this is a fraud? It's the perfect

636
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:24,370
crime because it cannot be curated after his
committed because the evidence has no connection

637
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:29,100
to the person who is meant to be voting. That's
the problem. As soon as it gets taken out

638
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:35,020
of the envelope, the identity of the voter
disappears from John Doe is from.

639
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:39,710
John Doe, who was dead, or John Doe who was
moved, is that correct or voted somewhere

640
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:44,530
else or voted? So why is that not provable?
There is an easy way to bust it, but it's

641
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:48,780
not the way you think. It's not to go find
the ballots in the ballot mix. You can't do

642
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:54,740
that. The way to find it is these guys have
the cell phone identification of all the mules,

643
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:59,700
all of them. So law enforcement has to step
in at this point and their next step. What

644
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:04,320
were you doing? Seven days to go go interview
the meals? Who paid you?

645
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:09,010
Where do you get the money? Will any states
law enforcement through this? This is a big

646
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:12,190
question. The mules aren't gonna fess up,
they don't. They know they're participating

647
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:15,930
in something. That is when you got you got
them on videotape you got 2000 people who

648
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:20,030
are committing felonies, right?

649
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:24,240
I'd like you to just reflect about what you've
learned today and how you're feeling and thinking

650
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,710
about it. It's just.

651
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:33,430
Sickening to me this is jaw dropping. What
you showed is frightening.

652
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:38,770
Republicans had no clue this was going on.

653
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:43,260
I wondered whether any Republicans who did
know?

654
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:49,000
Investigative journalist Heather Mullins interviews
a whistleblower hired by the National Republican

655
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:56,790
Senatorial Committee. I was hired by the NRSC.
My job was basically to watch the ballot boxes

656
00:58:56,790 --> 00:59:01,990
and this was for the early voting in Georgia.
So with that started on December 14th and

657
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:08,840
ended on the 31st of December and we would
monitor that box from 8 to 8 all day long.

658
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:12,620
So consequently, during those two two weeks.

659
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:17,270
I monitored those foxes indiscriminately.
I would move around to the different areas

660
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:22,460
in the boxes and watching 30 minutes here.
An hour in there and then I would start to

661
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:27,880
see things where I see people walking up with
backpacks and they were unloading large numbers

662
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:31,900
of ballots suffered in the box.

663
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:36,590
Recorded some of that and took pictures of
it and dates and times and those things I

664
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:42,580
spotted place from Texas from Colorado, South
Carolina and North Carolina and they thought

665
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:46,780
that was odd that all these states were coming
in and these people get on and watch them

666
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:51,520
get out and then they go up to the ballot
and stuff. The ballot and ballot box. I thought

667
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:57,090
that was kind of odd so you know, we took
pictures of those things when we took pictures,

668
00:59:57,090 --> 00:59:59,490
recorded license plates and those things.
And then I uploaded those photographs to a

669
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:01,670
Dropbox. Then when it came to.

670
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:07,450
The the Georgia runoff. The actual day of
the election was on January 5th.

671
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:11,880
I was up there, it was early in the morning.
Now there were Stacey Abrams people all along

672
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:16,020
the sidewalk up there. How did you know that
they were Stacey Abrams? Abrams people, though

673
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:20,780
well, they had those masks on it, said vote.
She has one of those things they had. This

674
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:25,770
was during COVID right and they were part
of that initiative. I knew that she was part

675
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:30,340
of that initiative that she had going on about.
Get out the boat kind of thing. So it was

676
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:34,570
Democratic Party and it was a group of people
that were, you know, they're all interacting

677
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:38,010
with each other and then the local.

678
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:42,300
Democratic Party chairman was there also about
6:30 that evening.

679
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:49,760
We noticed there was a couple of female couple.
These two ways had run off and they had big

680
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:54,760
stack of Alice and we were standing there
and they tried to shove the ballots in there

681
01:00:54,760 --> 01:01:00,130
and looking over taking pictures and the other
gentleman took some video and everything and

682
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:05,000
she turned around and looked at us and she
said what are you doing and I said well protecting

683
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
your picture.

684
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,200
And she said, well, you can't do that. And
I said, yes, I can.

685
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,450
And she got mad.

686
01:01:10,450 --> 01:01:16,600
Yeah, she brought up the sidewalk and left
so you're seeing the NRSC was made aware that

687
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:23,850
there were people stuffing dropboxes at specific
dates and times. So with what you witnessed

688
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:30,880
during your time watching these Dropbox, do
you believe that that was enough for law enforcement

689
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,730
to get involved?

690
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:38,830
After several weeks, no contact or anything,
and you know I just so you're saying though

691
01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:44,060
if if somebody had contacted you, you would
be willing to testify to these things and

692
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:57,260
and give those depositions. Underoath that
would have had to. Yeah I would have had to.

693
01:01:57,260 --> 01:02:02,480
Catherine hey Greg, just interviewed an informant
in Arizona who's now cooperating with authorities.

694
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:08,850
Oh wow. OK, check your email. OK, awesome,
I'll do it. Thanks so much. OK bye honey yeah,

695
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:14,510
take a look at this. So this is I remember
Greg was going to interview that mule and

696
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:17,380
so we got the video.

697
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:21,020
Thank you again for getting concealing her
identity.

698
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:26,430
What, what was your? What was your job like?
What, what, what, what were you doing a receptionist?

699
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:28,350
So at some point?

700
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:33,240
You were asked or or sort of instructed. I
guess to start receiving people's ballots

701
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:41,380
are you was just instructed to go ahead and
receive ballots from various people, females

702
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:42,380
mostly.

703
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:50,800
And and on Friday they would come and pick
up a payment. I assumed it was payments.

704
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,320
For what they were doing.

705
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:57,290
So they would during the week they would bring
them in.

706
01:02:57,290 --> 01:03:01,510
Various times and then you would pay them
like all on the Friday is that kind of how

707
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:08,490
it went. Yes, interesting, and then I would
get a call to find out how many ballots were

708
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:14,920
brought in and if they were already pre filled
out first and she would come to the office,

709
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:19,550
look at them and then before she left she
would either take them herself but other times

710
01:03:19,550 --> 01:03:25,040
she would ask me if I could drop them off
at the library. So what was the instruction

711
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:27,870
just to drop them off?

712
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:37,834
In the Dropbox Dropbox, the early ballots,
can you give me an idea of how many you personally

713
01:03:37,834 --> 01:03:38,834
put in the box?

714
01:03:38,834 --> 01:03:39,834
Hundreds.

715
01:03:39,834 --> 01:03:43,700
Open yes, and was there a reason they wanted
you? She wanted you to go to that drop box

716
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:47,100
as opposed to maybe City Hall or personal
conference.

717
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:50,340
There's no Tom rooster.

718
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:54,720
Well, she wouldn't want me to take it in the
evening when it was dark also.

719
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:59,030
Do you think this is widespread in Yuma County
or elsewhere?

720
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:06,280
I was saying that so do you think that people
you know in Saint Louis they believe that

721
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,660
their vote matters?

722
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:12,890
I don't even think they know the meaning of
what voting is. Do you personally think that

723
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:16,200
the elections in Saint Louis are free and
fair?

724
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,580
No.
Perfect.

725
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:19,650
They've been fixed.

726
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:23,090
They're already known seriously, who?

727
01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:29,860
It's gonna win the next election before it
even happens. How do you think this affects

728
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:37,610
the community, especially the Hispanic community?
Because it seems like they're praying on minorities.

729
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:42,020
They're an easy target because most of the
Hispanic.

730
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:44,900
Still live in the town.

731
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:51,570
Are not well educated as far as the law they
look at it and mostly as oh she's trying to

732
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:56,860
help us because we're older because she's
having someone come and pick it up at my house

733
01:04:56,860 --> 01:05:00,240
because I don't drive most of them maybe.

734
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:07,660
I would say honestly, 90% of the elderly still
live in Someways don't drive or have relatives

735
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:13,410
that are willing to drive up to do this to
go to the voting polls.

736
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:20,480
Back when I first moved into the city of Southwest,
I did have somebody come and knock on my door

737
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,190
and ask for my ballot.

738
01:05:22,190 --> 01:05:24,960
And it was somebody I knew.

739
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:29,490
And that I had known for many years since
I was a child.

740
01:05:29,490 --> 01:05:35,160
And up to the thing that person does not talk
to me because I said there was no way I was

741
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:41,670
giving them my ballot. What a brave woman
to do this totally. I call it the Mexican

742
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:42,680
mafia, seriously.

743
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:54,010
Because they they work like that. It seems
like we need to do a better job of maybe educating

744
01:05:54,010 --> 01:05:58,360
folks or or helping people understand that
this does not OK. I offered a long time ago,

745
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,120
but again he told me hold on though, because
you're going to end up in the trash can and

746
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:05,810
pieces. What do you think it's going to take
to get this trafficking to stop for people

747
01:06:05,810 --> 01:06:09,500
to get caught and pay the price?

748
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:14,770
Wow, unbelievable.

749
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:19,360
We know that the mules got their stashes of
ballots from these activist organizations.

750
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:26,740
But where did the activist organizations get
the ballots from?

751
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:31,480
Hans Bonds Bukovsky is a former member of
the Federal Election Commission, a senior

752
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:37,870
fellow at the Heritage Foundation and Co.
Author of the book are broken elections.

753
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:43,870
I will say election fraud is bipartisan, but
most of the cases I see are unfortunately

754
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:46,070
the Democratic Party.

755
01:06:46,070 --> 01:06:52,490
Hands you just watched a mule kind of fessing
up about participating in this trafficking

756
01:06:52,490 --> 01:06:58,120
operation. Is this kind of a mule operation
something familiar to you? But unfortunately

757
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:02,250
this is so common in some parts of America,
particularly the Hispanic community, that

758
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:05,460
they have a special name there. There they
call them political heroes.

759
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:12,810
And these are individuals who are paid by
campaigns or political parties to go into

760
01:07:12,810 --> 01:07:14,710
neighborhoods.

761
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:20,190
And collect absentee ballots to pressure and
coerce voters. People who observe election

762
01:07:20,190 --> 01:07:27,500
fraud have commented that absentee ballot
fraud or mail ballot fraud is the easiest

763
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:31,690
and the most common type of election fraud.
Why is that?

764
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:36,950
Well, because they're the only kind of ballot
that is voted outside the supervision of election

765
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:43,000
officials and outside the observation of poll
watchers. Transparency, as you know, is very

766
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:49,410
important in the election process. And there's
no one there at voters home to observe what's

767
01:07:49,410 --> 01:07:55,040
happening. Also, remember when you're in a
polling place, you fill out your ballot and

768
01:07:55,040 --> 01:08:00,060
you then deposit it directly into the ballot
box. That obviously is not what happens with

769
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:02,280
absentee ballots. There are some states.

770
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:08,040
I believe about half of them, about 27 states
that allow voter harvesting, and by voter

771
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:13,530
harvesting, what we mean is that you are allowed
to give your ballot to someone else and ask

772
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:15,720
them to deliver it.

773
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:22,770
Now, are there any states in which you're
allowed to pay mules to deliver ballots to

774
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:27,680
Dropbox? No, you're not supposed to be doing
that and allowing vote trafficking to begin

775
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:28,940
with.

776
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:37,069
Is a huge mistake because you're giving third
party strangers you know candidates, campaign

777
01:08:37,069 --> 01:08:41,640
staffers, party activists, all people who
have a stake in the outcome of the election.

778
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:45,780
You're giving them the ability to handle something
very valuable, a ballot.

779
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:53,630
Voter fraud is almost incalculably rare in
the United States. Does it ever happen OK?

780
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:58,450
Occasionally it does happen, but it doesn't
happen on a national scale, doesn't affect

781
01:08:58,450 --> 01:09:03,040
the outcome. It would affect the outcome.
I read these days constantly that election

782
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:09,560
fraud. Well, it could occur, but those cases
are extremely rare. They're so episodic they

783
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:16,900
don't have the ability to tip an election.
Is that true? Fraud happens often enough that.

784
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:23,270
Elections get overturned, I mean just go back
three years to 2018 and a congressional race

785
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:28,660
was overturned. I can cite to you another
case in Mississippi. It was just overturned

786
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:32,310
by a court because of fraud. Same thing in
Florida, but look, that's just the tip of

787
01:09:32,310 --> 01:09:37,980
the iceberg. Now we've shown that you've got
these mules who are picking up these ballots

788
01:09:37,980 --> 01:09:45,180
at various vote stash houses. Where do these
organizations get ballots? Well, quote Shakespeare.

789
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:50,480
Let me count the ways.

790
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:55,030
You know everything from filling out absentee
ballot request forms for voters, but having

791
01:09:55,030 --> 01:10:00,170
the ballot sent to them to actually going
to the voters and obtaining the ballots from

792
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:07,730
them to stealing them out of mailboxes to
actually using high quality photocopy machines

793
01:10:07,730 --> 01:10:09,580
to make their own ballots.

794
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:15,830
Look, these cases unfortunately go on all
the time you can go to 2018, which wasn't

795
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:22,420
that long ago when North Carolina Leslie Mccrae
Dowless is accused of mishandling absentee

796
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:27,520
ballots in North Carolina's 9th district.
Dallas would frequently obtain this report

797
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:31,800
from the Board of Elections looking for the
date an absentee ballot was mailed and if

798
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:37,110
it had been returned. Ginger Eason, who first
told me she was hired to pick up ballots,

799
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:40,780
and Kelly Hendricks who testified she did
the same thing.

800
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:44,460
What would you do if the ballots after you
picked them up take on straight to the office

801
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:48,810
in Dublin and hand them over to McRae? And
I don't know what happened to him after that.

802
01:10:48,810 --> 01:10:53,070
I know there was stacks of them on his desk.
There was testimony in the case that his staffers

803
01:10:53,070 --> 01:10:58,810
were falsely signing as witnesses on those
absentee ballots because he had done this

804
01:10:58,810 --> 01:11:07,360
before. He actually apparently had signatures
of voters from prior elections in his offices.

805
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:13,290
Voter rolls are in notoriously bad shape states
do a very bad job of taking people off who

806
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:19,070
are no longer eligible because they've died
or moved away, and it's very easy to get hold

807
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:24,151
of a state's voter registration list so you
know if somebody's on the list and they have

808
01:11:24,151 --> 01:11:29,190
voted in 10 years. You're probably pretty
safe and trying to cast a ballot on their

809
01:11:29,190 --> 01:11:34,920
behalf and on their behalf. Remember, in states
that made the mistake of simply mailing out

810
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:38,630
a absentee ballot to every single registered
voter.

811
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:45,040
Well, if you're a fraudster and you get hold
of that absentee ballot, you've got 90% of

812
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:49,940
the information you need to fill it out because
the name's gonna be on the outer envelope

813
01:11:49,940 --> 01:11:54,650
and they're registered address. Let's let's
follow the track of these mail out ballots,

814
01:11:54,650 --> 01:12:00,610
right? Let's just say you got students on
a campus they've voted, but then they graduate

815
01:12:00,610 --> 01:12:04,370
and obviously they moved to a different state.
If they're on the voter rolls, is it not a

816
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:09,110
fact that mail ballots will be arriving in
the dorms and arriving?

817
01:12:09,110 --> 01:12:12,810
And and so presumably they're not going to
be that hard to scoop up. If somebody knows

818
01:12:12,810 --> 01:12:16,560
how where to where to look for him, no, that's
exactly right. And you know, I work in the

819
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:21,750
District of Columbia. They mailed out absentee
ballots to all of their registered voters,

820
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:23,860
and I can't tell you how many phone calls.

821
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:30,230
By card from people that I know, saying that
not only had their ballot arrived in the mail,

822
01:12:30,230 --> 01:12:37,670
but 567 ballots all coming into their apartment
for people who used to live there. Now, a

823
01:12:37,670 --> 01:12:44,390
former Supreme Court Justice in Wisconsin
named Gableman has done it for a preliminary

824
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:50,540
report. He talks about the fact that there
are approximately 90,000 people in Wisconsin

825
01:12:50,540 --> 01:12:55,120
who are in resident care facilities or nursing
homes.

826
01:12:55,120 --> 01:13:04,610
So she's basically not capable any longer
of even remaining awake for more than a few

827
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:11,730
minutes, and so you surprised that she voted
in February 2021, absolutely, but I was surprised

828
01:13:11,730 --> 01:13:16,600
to hear that she voted in the last presidential
election.

829
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:22,860
She had voted for the last off and on for
the last 10 years.

830
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:30,670
I guess in my mind I thought if you put your
parent into a facility because they were incapacitated,

831
01:13:30,670 --> 01:13:38,170
they would not even be offered the vote they
make you vote. They make you vote here.

832
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:45,582
And and so how do they make you vote? Didn't
want to vote, and they told me I had to. That

833
01:13:45,582 --> 01:13:51,170
is a real problem. Clearly was a problem in
Wisconsin 2020, but unfortunately that's a

834
01:13:51,170 --> 01:13:57,840
perennial problem in other states too. What
happens is you have staff in those nursing

835
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:04,170
homes. Sometimes they are activists. Politically
they get these individuals registered to vote,

836
01:14:04,170 --> 01:14:09,290
or if already registered vote, they will request
absentee ballots in their name sometimes.

837
01:14:09,290 --> 01:14:13,810
Forging their signatures and then filling
out the ballots for them just prior to the

838
01:14:13,810 --> 01:14:20,900
2020 election, the state of Texas and died
in a social worker in a home for young people

839
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:27,380
who were basically mentally incompetent. She
had sent in over 100 voter registrations for

840
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:33,020
these individuals who were not legally competent
to vote.

841
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:37,900
What about homeless shelters? Look if a homeless
individual is mentally capable. They ought

842
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:42,430
to be able to vote, and if the only place
they can list is registered, address the homeless.

843
01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:47,140
Well, that's fine, but the problem there is
that it's very easy. I think for them to be

844
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:53,190
intimidated and coerced in Chicago, the largest
election fraud case, the US Justice Department

845
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:59,420
ever prosecuted, they were paying homeless
individuals to cast ballots the way they wanted

846
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:02,091
them to cast ballots. What made you want to?

847
01:15:02,091 --> 01:15:07,670
To do this, what made you want to get involved?
Well, I knew election stuff was supposed to

848
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:11,320
be something good to do, and then, plus I
needed a little extra money to get Christmas

849
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:17,270
for my son. So that's why the main reason
I did that who do these fraudsters pick on?

850
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:23,610
They pick on the most vulnerable in our society.
They go into poor neighborhoods. They pick

851
01:15:23,610 --> 01:15:28,320
on the elderly, they pick on people for whom
English is not their first language. When

852
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:32,590
we're trying to stop election fraud, we're
actually trying to protect. I, I'd say the

853
01:15:32,590 --> 01:15:39,880
most vulnerable people in our society.

854
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:43,960
We now know where the ballots could have come
from, but to pull off a heist like this on

855
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:49,850
a national scale would take deep pockets.
I wanted to find out where the money might

856
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:53,640
have come from, who could have funded the
heist?

857
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:57,890
I met with Scott Walter, an old colleague
of mine at the American Enterprise Institute

858
01:15:57,890 --> 01:16:03,110
who is now head of the Capital Research Center.
This is an organization that has produced

859
01:16:03,110 --> 01:16:07,420
multiple reports on the funding of elections.

860
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:12,210
People think of Three Rivers of money really
that empty into the Gulf of elections. The

861
01:16:12,210 --> 01:16:17,960
hard dollars to try to check to candidate
the second year. Soft money or dark money.

862
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:22,310
And then there's a third river that people
tend to neglect. But Capital Research Center

863
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:29,380
is studied intently and that is the 501C3
nonprofit money. The kind of charity that

864
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:36,580
you get to take a tax deduction for that river
is enormous. In the 2018 cycle, about $21

865
01:16:36,580 --> 01:16:37,580
billion.

866
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:46,010
Now, what do the IRS regulations say about
the involvement of these nonprofits? By law,

867
01:16:46,010 --> 01:16:51,990
these nonprofit charities are forbidden to
directly intervene in elections in any way

868
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:57,860
or to help a particular party or candidate.
The IRS is emphatic that you cannot intend

869
01:16:57,860 --> 01:17:03,590
or even have the effect of helping one party
or candidate over the other. Now, let's talk

870
01:17:03,590 --> 01:17:08,280
about some of the key elements of this particular
network.

871
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:14,520
That we're focusing on we have we have dropboxes
and those dropboxes are most people would

872
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:20,010
think funded entirely by the states. In other
words, the Dropbox is in Georgia funded by

873
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:25,010
the state of Georgia, but that's not entirely
the case. Is it? In the 2020 election, there

874
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:32,860
was an unprecedented hundreds of millions
of private dollars going into government election

875
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:38,580
offices. The 470 million or so dollars were
sent by Mark.

876
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:43,810
Zuckerberg and his wife. We did our part to
secure the integrity of the election. There

877
01:17:43,810 --> 01:17:51,240
were a few other places that put in much smaller
amounts. 1 entity that put in $25 million

878
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:57,530
was again a nonprofit. That's part of the
Arabella advisors, which as a total empire

879
01:17:57,530 --> 01:18:05,770
in 2020, took in $1.7 billion. Is there any
evidence that this operation had a partisan

880
01:18:05,770 --> 01:18:08,980
thrust or a partisan character? As we all
know?

881
01:18:08,980 --> 01:18:16,900
Big money rarely comes without strings attached.
One of the big ones is lots and lots of dropboxes.

882
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:22,480
Also lots and lots of vote by mail to get
your nice big checks you had to do things

883
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:29,700
like have dropboxes, encourage, vote by mail,
have ads and foreign languages, all kinds

884
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:34,700
of things that little by little are nudging
the turn out for one particular political

885
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:39,780
party in addition to the 470 or so $1,000,000.

886
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:47,400
That went into the suckback operation you
also had in 2020 $120 million project, very

887
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:53,950
secretive, called the Voter Registration Project.
The 120 million it came from Soros Foundation.

888
01:18:53,950 --> 01:18:59,950
It came from visas foundation. It came from
Warren Buffett Foundation. It came from unions

889
01:18:59,950 --> 01:19:06,310
like the SEIU, the voter registration project
has as its goal increasing in the 8 target

890
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:09,920
states over 2,000,000 voters.

891
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:14,190
Who are overwhelmingly expected to vote for
the Democratic Party, and so the states that

892
01:19:14,190 --> 01:19:21,980
we're talking about here, Arizona. Yes, Georgia,
yes. North Carolina. Yes, any others. Nevada

893
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:27,860
New Mexico. Here we've got an operation of
illegal vote trafficking. You've got thousands

894
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:33,580
of mules. They're being paid to do this. What
you're saying is there is more than enough

895
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:40,310
money available to fund any such operation.
In fact, this would be only one part.

896
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:48,040
Of a much larger effort to control the election,
we are talking half a billion dollars in nonprofit

897
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:54,080
charitable funds flowing into efforts to register
and get out the vote for Democrats, most of

898
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:59,300
the left wing mainstream media when they reported
on the Zuck box going through, they said they

899
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:03,430
made it sound like, oh, it's all going to
go for masks. And, you know, plexiglass and

900
01:20:03,430 --> 01:20:07,820
all and every study that's ever been done
of some of the grants to the big cities found

901
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:10,610
a few percent, maybe going to.

902
01:20:10,610 --> 01:20:16,239
Help people that way and the massive amounts
of money going into ginning up the vote by

903
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:22,060
mail operation and the drop box operation
and those sorts of things that benefit one

904
01:20:22,060 --> 01:20:28,160
political party. How confident should we be
that this will be a fair election? This sending

905
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:32,710
millions of ballots all over the country?
This is going to be a fraud like you've never

906
01:20:32,710 --> 01:20:37,280
seen Trump predicted. He said the Democrats
are going to cheat, that they're going to

907
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:41,030
use the pretext of COVID. They're going to
rig.

908
01:20:41,030 --> 01:20:47,110
Rules in their favor. Nevertheless, Republicans
focus their efforts on the campaign, while

909
01:20:47,110 --> 01:20:52,440
Democrats focus their efforts on the process
of actually running the election.

910
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:56,980
The two sides don't approach elections in
the same way the Democrats they understand

911
01:20:56,980 --> 01:21:04,090
that the rules the process by which elections
are conducted is just critical.

912
01:21:04,090 --> 01:21:09,480
We must now face the chilling reality the
Democrats conceived the highest. They funded

913
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:16,880
it, they organized it. Then they carried it
out.

914
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:23,210
They rigged and stole the 2020 presidential
election. We cannot be OK with this. We cannot

915
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:25,020
simply move on.

916
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:33,820
Guys I'd like to have your honest assessment
on what you've seen, what you've heard, and

917
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:42,100
what we can reasonably draw from it. What
do we have empirically? We have data.

918
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:47,750
Geolocated we have footage of people harvesting
ballots.

919
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:53,270
Do we know who those ballots were for? We
can't know who they were for. However, you

920
01:21:53,270 --> 01:22:00,420
have to inject common sense. Are we saying
that in the centres of Democrat held districts

921
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:08,100
we are seeing hundreds and hundreds of visits
to drop boxes with pro Trump ballots?

922
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:13,090
It beggars belief, it's ballot. Laundry looks
pretty convincing to me. We don't. I don't

923
01:22:13,090 --> 01:22:18,960
think we'll ever know the full story. And
what makes this crime so compelling and unique

924
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:23,950
is that once the ballot and enters the system,
it's really hard to reverse engineer it. But

925
01:22:23,950 --> 01:22:29,540
when you have the cell phone geolocation data
and then the actual footage of them doing

926
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:33,380
what you would expect them to be doing, taking
pictures of the ballots, taking gloves off,

927
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:38,600
visiting multiple times, I mean it seems pretty
clear to me, and it explains the.

928
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:41,170
Sudden spike in.

929
01:22:41,170 --> 01:22:44,711
Biden support that we saw late at night. Kind
of instinct that people had the control of

930
01:22:44,711 --> 01:22:49,280
the US Senate went through Georgia with Chuck
Schumer's Majority Leader, probably because

931
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:55,210
of what we just saw and liked them to answer
the mules. If they say it's clean then, then

932
01:22:55,210 --> 01:23:00,050
be honest and say, OK, two ways they try to
invalidate it. One is minimizing and then

933
01:23:00,050 --> 01:23:03,950
slander, so they'll try to slander Dinesh
personally. They'll say, oh Trump pardoned

934
01:23:03,950 --> 01:23:08,460
him or whatever. Therefore he's trying to
get back at Trump to try to reinforce the

935
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:11,720
big lie. I could already see the headline
in the Washington Post.

936
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:16,710
Trump pardoned Ally comes out with questionable
movie. I predict right now they will say what

937
01:23:16,710 --> 01:23:23,080
on Earth is a conservative doing tracking
private citizens? Gee, how day? What is Dinesh

938
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:30,820
D'souza doing to voters at 3:00 AM? In fact,
that will be part of the world will be intimidation.

939
01:23:30,820 --> 01:23:35,830
They'll say no person is safe. Communities
of color are being tracked. People like in

940
01:23:35,830 --> 01:23:39,100
black neighborhoods are now going to have
to fear for their life that their cell phone

941
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:41,880
pings will be paired. And this is this is.

942
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:47,020
Game Pro 2.0 dash. I disagree that this is
not going to be compelling enough.

943
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:52,130
This is a smoking gun. This is OJ Simpson
being seen leaving the scene of the crime.

944
01:23:52,130 --> 01:23:56,410
I don't care how partisan you are, you can't
dismiss all of this. How do you explain somebody

945
01:23:56,410 --> 01:24:00,350
going to a whole bunch of different drop boxes
with a whole bunch of different ballots on

946
01:24:00,350 --> 01:24:05,750
the same night at 3:57 AM in the morning?
How do you explain that that alone? I'm sorry?

947
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:10,460
I think a whole bunch of people in this country
are going to go Oh my God. If every American

948
01:24:10,460 --> 01:24:16,870
saw that, I think I think it would. It would
move the needle. However, their ability to.

949
01:24:16,870 --> 01:24:22,710
Keep their side ignorant is total that's going
to be impossible to keep a lid on this thing.

950
01:24:22,710 --> 01:24:27,480
Well, this movie is in Overton Window moment,
right? So documentaries can do this every

951
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:30,770
once in a while. Michael Moore did it. He
moved the Overton window in many different

952
01:24:30,770 --> 01:24:35,250
topics 20 years ago. Al Gore did it with climate
change. It'll happens as Ernest Hemingway

953
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:39,360
said gradually and then. Suddenly, because
it's not just how many people are going to

954
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:42,813
watch this film, it's who's going to watch
it. It's going to be lawmakers. It's going

955
01:24:42,813 --> 01:24:45,560
to be people that work for the Bureau. It's
going to be someone, somewhere with a conscious

956
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:46,940
that has power and.

957
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:52,400
OK, this is a problem. It can't be dismissed
and it can't be dismissed. They have ruined

958
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:57,840
Election Day in the United States of America.
That's provable, and that's enough for me

959
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:06,480
to fight the left with every fiber in my body.

960
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:11,500
Without free and fair elections, we are not
a democracy. We are a nation run by a criminal

961
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:15,940
cartel masquerading as a democracy.

962
01:25:15,940 --> 01:25:21,120
Never in U.S. history has a presidential election
been as thoroughly corrupted by coordinated

963
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:27,860
fraud across multiple states. As we now know
took place in 2020.

964
01:25:27,860 --> 01:25:34,400
Today, totalitarian regimes camouflage their
fake elections with appearance of democracy,

965
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:37,610
but they're not real democracies.

966
01:25:37,610 --> 01:25:40,090
We don't want to join them.

967
01:25:40,090 --> 01:25:45,460
Our elections must represent the will of American
citizens.

968
01:25:45,460 --> 01:25:51,040
We who believe in constitutional democracy
must be diligent if we give up, they win.

969
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:56,230
In fact, if enough of us give up, they won't
need to cheat anymore.

970
01:25:56,230 --> 01:26:01,770
Don't stay home, get involved, get out and
vote. Do what is necessary to save this great

971
01:26:01,770 --> 01:26:19,560
country, the America we love needs us now
more than ever.
