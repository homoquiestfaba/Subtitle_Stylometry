1
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:30,030
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Robin Williams!

2
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:49,916
Thank you!

3
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,090
Oh, please!

4
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,459
Sit the fuck down!

5
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,494
Thank you!

6
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,563
Thank you!

7
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,199
Thank you!

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,035
Oh, yes!

9
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,439
Oh, yes, my little
semain headed friend!

10
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,375
That's it! Good night!
Thank you very much!

11
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:19,479
Thank you for the standing ovation,
you made the orgasm up front.

12
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:21,881
Let's have a cigarette, let's relax.

13
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,785
We're here in New York,
fucking New York!

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,488
Yes!

15
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:34,761
Obviously this is not gonna
be your normal night of theater!

16
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:38,264
This will be Shakespeare
with a strap-on!

17
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:41,401
So that's the way you like it!

18
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:46,172
Welcome to my lovely set which is
from the musical "Fantastic Voyage"!

19
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:50,543
Or maybe the last thing
a clitoris sees!

20
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,648
I'm over here!

21
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,684
I'm down here!

22
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:01,921
This is brought to you by HBO,
which is subsidiary of Time Warner,

23
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,623
also owned by
America On Line...

24
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:05,825
"You've got mail".
I hope you don't have stocks!

25
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,628
Welcome!

26
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,064
Don't be afraid!

27
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,934
It was so reassuring
the other day...

28
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,904
George W. Bush talked
to the stock market and...

29
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,975
It must be him
talking about business ethics

30
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:24,077
it's kinda like having
a leopard give you a facial.

31
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,146
It doesn't really work!

32
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,517
"A lot of our imports
come from other countries".

33
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,485
No shit?!

34
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:36,523
Moving right along...

35
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,126
Meanwhile,
Michael is protesting...

36
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,598
I don't know, baby...

37
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,336
It was strange enought when Michael
was the best man at Lisa's wedding.

38
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:52,972
That for me was like,
"You're pushing the term, my man"!

39
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:57,677
That was a pretty short list.
Was Richard Simmons hunting?

40
00:02:57,711 --> 00:03:01,147
- "What are you doing"?
- "I'm the best man"!

41
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,783
Now Michael is claming rasism.

42
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,386
I'm going,
"Honey, you gotta pick a race first".

43
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,763
"What are you claiming,
mistreatment of elves"?

44
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:20,200
"Girl, you gotta pick a gender, too.
What are you going for"?

45
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:23,703
"You were Diana Ross.
Now you've just left it all behind".

46
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:29,509
Michael, you're not a freak.
You're just surgically enhanced...

47
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:33,346
And you spend more money
than the Vatican.

48
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:35,682
If you go to Neverland, it says

49
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:38,284
"You must be this
high to ride Michael".

50
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:50,196
Obviously, people and the lawyers
for HBO are going, "Fuck"!

51
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,399
But how fucked up
do you have to be

52
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,168
for Al Sharpton to go,
"I'm outta here, man"!

53
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,578
If Al Sharpton bails on your ass,

54
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,915
even rats are going,
"Man, that guy's quick"!

55
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,118
"From the Don King School
of hair processing..."

56
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,754
He's running for
office in Idaho on the

57
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:19,426
"What a fucking, wild, crazy chance
in hell you'll be elected" ticket.

58
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:22,529
Sorry, my lips just went,
"What the fuck did you say"?

59
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:26,199
Couple of dyslexic people went,
"Thank you, Robin"!

60
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,368
"Thank you"!

61
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,237
We were worried about
the pledge of allegiance.

62
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,173
We were gonna say
"One nation under dog"!

63
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,241
It's OK.

64
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,711
I know people are going
"I've got a cure for this"!

65
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,814
"One nation under Canada,
above Mexico".

66
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,017
But then you have to the whole...

67
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,987
There's anthems like
"Someone bless America"!

68
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:51,191
On the dollar bill, instead
of "In God We Trust",

69
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,593
"In Gates We Trust"!

70
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,929
"Mr. Gates, when did you realize
you are creating monopoly"?

71
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:57,163
"Monopoly is just a game, senator".

72
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,766
"I'm trying to control
the fucking world".

73
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:03,937
Don't you see Windows Millenium?

74
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,872
It's all leading to
Information Technology.

75
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,775
Soon it will be Total
Information Technology, "TIT".

76
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:13,713
And when you're sucking on the tit,
I have you by the motherboard.

77
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,216
Don't be afraid!

78
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:19,319
It's a nice day
in New York, my people.

79
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:23,356
NY police have a catch and
release program. Way to go!

80
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,094
Stop! OK, go on again!

81
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,132
You're it!
Get the fuck outta here!

82
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:36,770
I like NY on a day like today. For a
while everything went like "are you OK"?.

83
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,840
People're back to being newyorkers
like "Have a nice day, asshole"!

84
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,877
"Fuck you, my friend!
Enjoy your day"!

85
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:48,148
But the most beautiful thing about
a day like today in this NY is

86
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:51,051
that the ladies
take the twins for a walk!

87
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,920
Oh, yeah, the tities are out today!

88
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:59,826
On a hot day all the tities are out
there. And like God made them go...

89
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:04,197
Beautiful tiddies, all shapes, sizes
and women running, they are going...

90
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:08,368
And then they hit a
breeze and "chicken's done"!

91
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,038
Yes!
Yeah, baby!

92
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,008
These are not like
the tits in Vegas,

93
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:17,711
where even God goes
"I didn't make those"!

94
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:22,215
Weird tits. You know
fake tits are like nazis.

95
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,384
They don't laugh,
they don't dance, they're just...

96
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,887
"I'm walking here"!

97
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:31,124
I've seen a woman turn
and the tits stayed there.

98
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:38,665
Babies, lucky they don't have any
teeth becayse they'd knock them out.

99
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:40,700
I've seen tits that are really bad,

100
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,436
like they had the nipples on the top,
it looked like Kilroy.

101
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:54,280
When you go up Madison Avenue
you see some hardcore surgery like...

102
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,185
"I'm so scared,
but I can't express it".

103
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:04,391
These are the ladies who've had
so much surgery, they're going

104
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:05,725
"What are these lumps
under my eyes"?

105
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,560
"Those are your tits, madam"!

106
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:12,832
- And what's this?
- Don't ask, Mrs. Trotski!

107
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,203
This is good news for you.

108
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:20,707
And girls getting
Botox injections...?

109
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:25,612
- Look, I don't have any wrinkles.
- You also have no expression.

110
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,282
You look like you've had
a slight coma, but you're beautiful.

111
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:36,823
When guys say to you "Baby, I want
you to get your tits done for me, OK"?

112
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,093
"Do it for me.
Do it for your daddy man".

113
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,295
And you say
"OK, daddy man"!

114
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:46,066
"Then I want you to get
your balls done for me, OK"?

115
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:50,236
I want you to get
those big old basket balls.

116
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:54,174
So when you do the baywatch
thing, it's like...

117
00:07:55,208 --> 00:08:00,013
Nothing drives a woman crazy like a
big old Easter basket on her bunny.

118
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:04,851
So you go to the doctor...

119
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,790
Payback's a bitch!
Go for it, girls!

120
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,994
Because you went through a hard time.
This whole winter was so bizarre.

121
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:20,667
Temperatures were like 80, 20,
30, 50. It was fucking weird!

122
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:22,235
The weathermen are going,

123
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,637
"I don't fucking
know what's going on"!

124
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:27,907
"Let's just see what happens".

125
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:31,878
Flowers were like Anne Heche
going "I'm out, I'm in, I'm out..."

126
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,548
"I don't know where to go"!

127
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:46,893
George came back from Japan, he went
"I went to the Coyote Conference"

128
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,030
- No, it's Kyoto.
- That's a very good car.

129
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:53,333
George, walk away.

130
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:55,602
And they say there's no global warming,

131
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,004
but right now the
North Pole is a pool.

132
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:03,543
It is beyond global warming,
at this point it is cooking.

133
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,348
It's 105 in the middle of the country,
and people come up going,

134
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,548
"Is it hot enough for you"?

135
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:13,053
"No, I like sweat to be rolling down
the crack of my ass like Niagra".

136
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:18,324
"I like my old man
tities to lactate, my man".

137
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:23,329
You see people in shorts and you're
going "Please, don't wear those"!

138
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,266
"Oh please, don't put those on"!

139
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,301
If you go to South West Airline
they're  going,

140
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:32,072
"Sorry, you're not fat,
you're horizontally challenged".

141
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:36,309
Big people at South West
Airlines have buy two seats.

142
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:38,545
The problem is that
they are not together.

143
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:44,484
And you have to put your
tits in the overhead rack.

144
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:47,520
People don't mind now.
We're working our way through.

145
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:49,689
All over the country
you've got weird things.

146
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:52,158
In Houston they got Enron field.

147
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:55,328
"We were gonna call it
5th Amendment field but fuck..."

148
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,232
We can't call it
"We're fucked field"!

149
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:03,236
"Arthur Anderson put in the
chairs, they spin both ways".

150
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:08,875
And now Martha Stuart
may become somebody's bitch.

151
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,612
No!

152
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,348
Say it ain't so!

153
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,152
I like to consider it more
like "severe companion".

154
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:23,923
If you only have one room, and I
like to call it my "private space",

155
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:29,029
use the light well. You have vertical
bars, don't use horizontal blinds.

156
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:33,533
Also, think of your ankle
bracelet as an accessory.

157
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:39,639
The first time she has lunch going
"You call this keesh"?

158
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:43,610
Shut up, bitch!
You're inside now, you're mine!

159
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:51,785
All over things have been going good.
I've been to Memphis, to Graceland.

160
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:55,188
I never knew that Ray Charles
had a decorating license.

161
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:56,856
They're some severe...

162
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,727
They're colours there that
have never seen daylight.

163
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,997
I've been to Nashville, I've heard
people sing songs like

164
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:09,269
"Take your finger outta my ass,
cause I'm leaving you behind"!

165
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:14,874
Funny ass shit people do now.
I'm sweatin' like crazy up here.

166
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:18,078
It's HBO, cause it's live.

167
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:24,684
People playing baseball.
You've got a good seat.

168
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,653
Yankees are kicking
again, way to go!

169
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,293
You did a good job.
It came through.

170
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:37,130
Everybody's worried about people
playing baseball on steroids.

171
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:39,933
Here's one quick way you tell

172
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:43,870
on steroids, your balls shrink
and your head grows.

173
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,372
So if someone steps up to the plate

174
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:48,375
with a Mardi Gras head and
Raisinettes, "You're out"!

175
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:52,379
Poor Barry Bonds!
They won't pitch to him

176
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,646
and when they do it,
they're trying to kill him.

177
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,915
He's like Yasser Arafat
of baseball.

178
00:11:57,784 --> 00:12:00,420
For Jerusalem I have
an interesting plan.

179
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:03,423
It's called a timeshare,
like Miami, let's try that.

180
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:06,626
Jews will get Hanukah and Passover,

181
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:09,329
Christians will get
Christmas and Easter

182
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:12,665
and Muslims will have Ramadan
and that other holiday, Kaboom.

183
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:19,305
Obviously, the people of HBO
are going "Oh, fuck off"!

184
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,374
"What are you doing, you asshole"!

185
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:26,346
I'm very excited
because this is my time

186
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:29,249
when I was watching
World Cup Soccer, my man.

187
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,117
I saw world cup, baby.

188
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:34,087
There's a few soccer fans,
the rest of you are going

189
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,223
"Uh, that's like football
without pads, right"?

190
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,492
For the rest of the
world, it's football.

191
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:42,562
For us, it's "A strange sport,
played by damaged people".

192
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,865
We made it in the World Cup.
Everybody plays it.

193
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,935
Not like the World Series, cause the
French don't have a baseball team.

194
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:53,106
If they did, they would only have
left field and no one would be safe.

195
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:55,642
You know what I'm saying?

196
00:12:56,042 --> 00:13:00,413
What can you do, huh?
It is Bastille day, alore!

197
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:07,387
The day that Marie Antoinette
gave the ultimate head. Look out!

198
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:10,523
We are French. Fuck you, Americans,
I don't care!

199
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:15,495
My friend Lance Armstrong is racing
right now in The Tour du France.

200
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:18,998
And every year the French
go, "He is on chemicals".

201
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,202
"It's chemotherapy,
you little toad sucker".

202
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,506
Okay, he has one testicle,
he's aerodynamic.

203
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:30,610
Everyone, cut off your balls.
You'll be quicker, do it!

204
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:32,946
Don't be afraid.

205
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:38,451
When you look at the World Cup,
America finally made it.

206
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:41,988
We made it to the sixteen, baby!

207
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:49,796
We're no longer in the
"Special Olympics" category.

208
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,767
They used to see us coming "Give
it to them, they're damaged people"!

209
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:59,305
Thank you for the ball.
I got a ball. I shoot the ball!

210
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:04,711
Unlike the Brazilians.
When they play is like...

211
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,748
And the fans are like...

212
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:12,686
Brazilians are going
"Look, I'm playing soccer..."

213
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:15,455
"Look, I'm scoring"!

214
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:18,358
"And now I'm kicking the ball".

215
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:23,563
Soccer is kinda mellow, you know.
Is a little passive agressive though.

216
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:27,734
I didn't do anything...
What are you looking at?

217
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:29,769
It's not like hockey, when someone
comes up with a stick and goes

218
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:30,904
"Bang, motherfucker"!

219
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:33,239
That's why there are no
Spanish hockey players.

220
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,508
When a white guy takes
a stick and goes...

221
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:38,211
"Motherfucker, I'm going
to cut you off now"!

222
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:43,316
"And you, Freddie Krugger bitch,
take off the mask, motherfucker"!

223
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,485
"Coming in there!
Goddamnit"!

224
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:51,825
Sometimes guys do this weird thing...
They fall down and pretend like...

225
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:57,931
"I've been killed...
I've been blinded..."

226
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:04,004
"There's nobody near me, huh?
OK, I'm kidding"!

227
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,774
And the referee comes over,
"Yellow card"!

228
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,011
Two yellow cards,
"Red card"!

229
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,614
Hold on, three cards,
"Green card"!

230
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:17,550
And the referee is so sweet, too.

231
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:24,024
"What's your name?
Turn around".

232
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:29,829
"Why didn't you call me
after the Mexico game"?

233
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,772
Not like football referees who have
that "too much commercial time"!

234
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:42,042
Mad white man dancing on the field!

235
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,413
Moving away.
Moving away.

236
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:52,452
In the World Cup they always
claim there's bad refereeing,

237
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:53,653
someone may have been paid off.

238
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,256
Oh, shit, say it ain't so!

239
00:15:56,823 --> 00:16:00,827
You're telling me that the Oscars
are also political? Fuck off!

240
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:05,465
There's a game mafia!

241
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:12,972
The mov-hand!

242
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:18,845
Fairy Godfather, "Does this
pistol make my ass look big"?

243
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,551
If you go to LA, there's a great
greeting these people do, "Love ya"!

244
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:28,355
"Love you"!
"Hey, love you"!

245
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:41,534
The worst refereeing was in the
Winter Olympics with the French judge.

246
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,603
Once again, the
French fuck with us!

247
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:48,908
The Canadians, they skate perfectly.
"We did it perfect, huh"!

248
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:51,878
And then the Russians
they come and fuck up

249
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:56,483
and the French judge went, "How lifelike,
they fucked up, I give it to them, eh"?

250
00:16:56,883 --> 00:17:00,520
At that point I'm going "Where is
Tanya Harding when you need her"?

251
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:05,558
Tanya would've been on that
judge like shit on Velcro.

252
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:09,529
"Give me that medal,
you French whore"!

253
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:13,767
"I won"!

254
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:17,804
Instead we get to see
Tanya fight Paula Jones

255
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:20,273
in an all white trash weekend.

256
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:25,412
Trailer park Tuesday!

257
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:31,551
Tanya went right for the nose,
"Not the nose, that's the Clinton money"!

258
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:35,655
Next is gonna be Joey Butafuoco
fights John Wayne Bobbit.

259
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:38,725
There will be no hitting
bellow the belt there, my friend.

260
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:43,596
"Fuck, man, give that back!
My balls are in the front row"!

261
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:48,335
What's next? "The Nixon daughters
battle for the library money".

262
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:52,005
"Be there as my bitches go at it"!

263
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:53,774
At this point, even
Caligula is going,

264
00:17:53,841 --> 00:17:56,576
"What the fuck
are you people doing"?

265
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,678
Why don't you have
Hannibal Lector on Iron Chef

266
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:00,880
just kick out the jams?

267
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:04,852
Cause we've got The Chamber,
The Chair, Fear Factor.

268
00:18:04,985 --> 00:18:08,254
People in Texas are going
"We got those shows".

269
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:12,926
"We just don't film'em".

270
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:17,564
Two weeks ago, the Supreme Court banned
the execution of retarded people.

271
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:20,633
People in Texas are going,
"Shit, where's the fun now"?

272
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:24,371
Cause they were zapping retarded
people every other week.

273
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:27,007
It was like, "Go sit on
Santa's lap, Timmy".

274
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:36,850
And I know the definition of
"retarded" in Texas is pretty wide.

275
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:44,958
It's crazy!

276
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,867
Even the Taliban is going
"You are crazy motherfuckers"!

277
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:56,436
There was a guy with one leg. They
weren't gonna give him a wodden leg.

278
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:58,872
He was gonna be dead man hopping.

279
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:05,612
There is a moment of compassion.
Before the lethal injection,

280
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:07,947
they do an alcohol swab,
which is so nice!

281
00:19:11,918 --> 00:19:13,353
"What the fuck are you doing"?

282
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:18,591
"We don't want you to get
that last-second infection"!

283
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,495
"It's all safe now".

284
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:27,367
You remember the Winter Olympics.
They had them in Utah. Great place!

285
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,370
What, was Amish country booked,
what happened?

286
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:35,241
"Come on down to Salt Lake!
We're gonna party like it's 1955".

287
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:39,045
"Bring your wives. Oops!
Come on down"!

288
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:41,514
At the closing ceremony
they introduced

289
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,484
Donnie and Marie,
as the first couple of Utah.

290
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:51,691
I went "Uh-uh, honey, no!
They're only a couple in Arkansas".

291
00:19:55,795 --> 00:20:00,433
If you're going to Georgia,
Ted Turner and Jane Fonda broke up.

292
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:05,372
Jane found God
and Ted found out it wasn't him.

293
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:08,308
We're at the olympics once again,

294
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:11,411
we're talking about
the figure skating.

295
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:14,114
I find the figure skating
to be kinda sexy.

296
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:17,884
Not ice dancing, which is polka
on Valium. That's not good.

297
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:22,122
There's that pairs figure skating.
There's that one very special lift.

298
00:20:22,155 --> 00:20:24,224
Where the male skater goes...

299
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,326
Right here!

300
00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:30,063
Where even a gynecologist would go
"Put on a glove, man"!

301
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:34,067
Who's your daddy?
Who's your daddy?

302
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:37,904
And I'm going
"Let's cut the foreplay,"

303
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:40,173
"let's have ice fucking,
come on"!

304
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:58,692
And she holds on without her hands!

305
00:21:15,175 --> 00:21:18,845
Even the French judge would go
"I like it"!

306
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:23,249
"I don't care. I'm giving them
the medal. Fuck the Canadians"!

307
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,385
"So fabulous"!

308
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:29,723
There's other kinda sexual things
in the Olympics, there's the louge,

309
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:31,091
about which I have only one question.

310
00:21:31,224 --> 00:21:35,495
What drunken, German gynecologist
invented that sport?

311
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,200
"You know what? I want
to dress like a sperm,"

312
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:44,237
"shove an ice skate in my ass,"

313
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:47,774
"and go balls first
down an ice chute".

314
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:51,077
"Ya! That would be fun".

315
00:21:52,946 --> 00:21:55,515
No! This is for pussies!

316
00:21:56,016 --> 00:21:58,451
- How will you stir?
- I will do kegels!

317
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:02,522
"I will flex my ass
and go down the ramp"!

318
00:22:04,124 --> 00:22:06,993
And do not talk to me
about the two men louge.

319
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,329
I'm saying "Boys, get a room"!

320
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:12,632
"Make that turn, you bastard, make it"!

321
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,368
"Hard right, you fucker, hard right"!

322
00:22:16,036 --> 00:22:21,107
Pour guy gets to the end of the run
"I got wood man, I'm sorry"!

323
00:22:21,241 --> 00:22:22,976
"You cost us the race"!

324
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:26,279
"Your penis going frr was
200 of a second winds resistance"!

325
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:29,482
"We could've won if you
weren't going brrring"!

326
00:22:29,883 --> 00:22:31,518
"Dolphin boy"!

327
00:22:35,155 --> 00:22:37,557
There's always some
horrible drug scandal.

328
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,026
This year was a Spanish
cross-country skilor...

329
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:41,361
Skilor, which is like a skier.

330
00:22:42,829 --> 00:22:45,965
- Are you a skilor?
- Yes!

331
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:52,772
They accused him of taking
some performance enhancing drug.

332
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:55,775
Like an elephant growth hormone.

333
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:58,345
"Are you on some sort of drug"?

334
00:23:00,347 --> 00:23:02,882
"Are you taking an
animal tranquilizer"?

335
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:10,990
And they didn't bother
drug testing the snowboarders.

336
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:14,361
"Go, go my little boys, have fun"!

337
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:18,798
I guess they realized the word
"half pipe" ment something.

338
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:23,570
Remember the kid who
won the gold medal?

339
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:25,372
He was in freestyle.

340
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:30,677
- You wanna be on a box of Whities?
- No. Count Chocula.

341
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,946
A-ha! A clue, Sherlock!

342
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,583
The poor Canadian snowboarder,
in the 1998 Olympics,

343
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:39,419
they took away his medal because
he tested positive for marijuana,

344
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:40,587
which is kinda redundant number one.

345
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:45,759
Number two, they said that marijuana
was a "performance-enhancing drug".

346
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:53,867
Marijuana enhances many things,
colors, tastes, sensations,

347
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:56,536
but you are certainly
not fucking empowered.

348
00:23:57,904 --> 00:24:01,641
When you're stoned, you're lucky if
you can find your own goddamn feet.

349
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:04,511
The only way it's a
performance-enhancing drug is

350
00:24:04,644 --> 00:24:06,946
if there's a big fucking Hershey
bar at the end of the run.

351
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:11,451
Then you'll be like...

352
00:24:13,386 --> 00:24:17,123
Then you'll be like a Swiss
ski jumper going, "I'm there"!

353
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,759
Pour Canadian snowboarder.
They asked for his medal back

354
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:22,595
and he couldn't find it. It
was around his fucking neck!

355
00:24:23,363 --> 00:24:26,433
Get out of here, you little
goofy Canadian bastard, eh?

356
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,802
They have weird sports
like the Biathalon

357
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:31,037
which is like Norwegian drive-by.

358
00:24:33,773 --> 00:24:35,175
"Get the TV, Hans"!

359
00:24:37,744 --> 00:24:42,215
The Canadians won the
gold medal in hockey.

360
00:24:42,382 --> 00:24:47,253
God bless you Canadian people.

361
00:24:47,287 --> 00:24:49,589
You're so fucking nice, eh?

362
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:53,126
It's your only
fucking sport, come on!

363
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:56,196
That and a mutant form of football.

364
00:24:56,363 --> 00:24:57,764
"We've got 13 men, we
have a longer field"

365
00:24:57,964 --> 00:24:59,666
"No, you have fun, enjoy"!

366
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:05,405
Canada's like a loft apartment
over a really great party.

367
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:11,244
"Keep it down, eh"?

368
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:18,451
"We are nice. We have Jean Chritien,
our great prime minister".

369
00:25:18,485 --> 00:25:21,721
He was the only man in the world who said,
"I don't need no secret service"

370
00:25:21,755 --> 00:25:24,391
"If a guy comes to hit me,
I fucking knock him out, eh"?

371
00:25:24,724 --> 00:25:28,495
"I'm Jean Chritien which versus
your president, who's a cretin".

372
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:32,599
Quebec keeps wanting to break away from
Canada, but still keep the currency.

373
00:25:33,433 --> 00:25:34,634
It's like a kid moving
out of the house,

374
00:25:34,768 --> 00:25:36,970
-But I still would like to get money.
-Fuck off you!

375
00:25:38,772 --> 00:25:42,075
Canadian money is also
called the Looney.

376
00:25:42,242 --> 00:25:44,944
How can you take an
economic crisis seriously?

377
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:49,649
- The Looney is down!
- Oh, how sad for you!

378
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:51,484
What are you saying, eh?

379
00:25:52,686 --> 00:25:57,023
Everyone was so happy that at the
Olympics the security was so tight.

380
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,792
"Security was amazing
at the Olympics".

381
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:01,761
Utah's the whitest
fucking State in the Union!

382
00:26:02,562 --> 00:26:06,533
An Arab in Utah is like an albino
at the Apollo. You would notice!

383
00:26:10,637 --> 00:26:16,176
- We found one!
- He's just tanned. Everybody off!

384
00:26:16,376 --> 00:26:19,612
The problem was that there was
basically white powder everywhere.

385
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:21,214
All the dogs looking
for anthrax were going

386
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,452
"You go, man, you go"!

387
00:26:25,885 --> 00:26:28,154
Pour dogs they looked
for anthrax and cocain.

388
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:30,156
In the cage at the end
of the day they're going

389
00:26:30,323 --> 00:26:33,126
"I can't taste my ass,
I don't know why..."

390
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:37,530
"It's my tail"!

391
00:26:39,532 --> 00:26:41,267
Meanwhile your cat
sits over there going

392
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:43,670
"You're still an
asshole, you know that".

393
00:26:44,504 --> 00:26:47,674
Is it me, or are cats drag queens?

394
00:26:48,074 --> 00:26:49,943
The way they kinda go
"Who loves Kitty"?

395
00:26:54,814 --> 00:26:56,149
"Are these your shoes"?

396
00:26:58,752 --> 00:27:01,054
Who loves Kitty?
Who loves Kitty?

397
00:27:01,855 --> 00:27:04,624
Male cats have that amazing thing,

398
00:27:04,724 --> 00:27:07,227
where they kinda walk around going
"That's mine"!

399
00:27:09,596 --> 00:27:11,931
"Mine"!

400
00:27:12,866 --> 00:27:14,934
"I like that too".

401
00:27:15,435 --> 00:27:17,804
Thank God men aren't like that!

402
00:27:17,837 --> 00:27:21,207
"Nice car, Bob.
Mine now"!

403
00:27:22,175 --> 00:27:25,612
- What are you doing?
- Just shopping!

404
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,394
The whole anthrax thing
had people going...

405
00:27:41,528 --> 00:27:44,064
They said
"Don't open your mail"!

406
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:47,801
- Why?
- There's white powder in envelopes.

407
00:27:48,234 --> 00:27:50,503
"Really"!?

408
00:27:51,805 --> 00:27:54,274
"Your mother and I used to look
for white powder in envelopes"!

409
00:27:54,407 --> 00:27:56,710
"We weren't on-line.
We did lines, my friend".

410
00:27:57,744 --> 00:28:00,814
"And there were ninjas on the
fucking lawn, trying to kill us"!

411
00:28:02,615 --> 00:28:04,718
And now, there are people
trying to kill us.

412
00:28:04,918 --> 00:28:06,686
And that's why
I bought a gas mask.

413
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:12,525
I can't even get a condom
on when I want to!

414
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:18,264
"Hey, baby. Yeah, I got
a love glove. Hold on".

415
00:28:21,601 --> 00:28:23,470
"I'll be right with you, honey".

416
00:28:23,503 --> 00:28:27,640
"Don't go away on me now".

417
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,413
You're playing "Beat the cock".

418
00:28:34,848 --> 00:28:37,584
"I got it, I got it"!

419
00:28:40,353 --> 00:28:43,923
There's your penis like a
midget in a diving suit...

420
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,092
"I don't think we're
going in today, Pete".

421
00:28:47,894 --> 00:28:49,596
"We didn't make the deadline".

422
00:28:58,972 --> 00:29:03,743
Remember when they sent anthrax
to Tom Daschle's office?

423
00:29:04,144 --> 00:29:05,712
And they cleared that
fucking place out.

424
00:29:06,012 --> 00:29:10,550
"Everybody out, come on"!
Helmets, suits, they're all leaving.

425
00:29:10,684 --> 00:29:11,518
And when the Congressman
walked out they go

426
00:29:11,651 --> 00:29:14,754
"But the rest of you,
go about your lives".

427
00:29:15,488 --> 00:29:17,123
"Everything is perfectly OK".

428
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,926
"We'll be miles away".

429
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:23,463
It's like when you go to the dentist
and he puts a little lead bib over your balls.

430
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:27,333
He walks behind concrete, going
"You'll be fine"!

431
00:29:31,705 --> 00:29:33,306
How can you tell
if Congress was sick?

432
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,842
It's night of the living dead anyway.

433
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:39,112
All those old senators going

434
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:42,816
"The confederate flag is just
the symbol of state's rights".

435
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:46,386
Yeah, and the swastika
is just a Tibetan good luck charm.

436
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:53,226
When did Ted Kennedy
become Jabba the Hutt?

437
00:29:55,028 --> 00:29:56,996
He's huge!

438
00:29:57,397 --> 00:30:00,667
You're a Kennedy, not a Maisy's
day float, come on!

439
00:30:01,034 --> 00:30:04,204
Bring him down.
We're voting!

440
00:30:04,904 --> 00:30:08,975
Step away, boy.
"I said no to the Crispy Cream".

441
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:13,847
Congress recently
approved the covert plan

442
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,750
to assassinate Saddam Hussein.

443
00:30:19,386 --> 00:30:22,622
So what they've done,
is publicly approve

444
00:30:22,756 --> 00:30:25,725
the secret plan to
assassinate Hussein.

445
00:30:26,693 --> 00:30:28,928
I wonder if he knows?

446
00:30:31,364 --> 00:30:36,803
I know there's a cure for bio
terrorism that they sent at us.

447
00:30:38,204 --> 00:30:41,307
And it lies within
Keith Richards, I know that.

448
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:43,076
He is the only man on the planet
who can go,

449
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:47,480
"Anthrax?
All right..."

450
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:54,320
"Doesn't go with my
E. cola, but fuck"!

451
00:30:55,655 --> 00:31:00,093
Keith is the only man who can make
the Osbornes look fucking Amish.

452
00:31:01,094 --> 00:31:06,766
I've seen him go to a drug
dealer who said "I'm out, man"!

453
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,334
"I have nothing left".

454
00:31:08,735 --> 00:31:11,104
Supposedly he goes to Switzerland
and changes his blood.

455
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:14,674
Not like one pint, but like a
fucking Chevrolette, all of it.

456
00:31:14,808 --> 00:31:17,744
I just wanna know
who gets his blood?

457
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:19,045
Some old Swiss man's going,

458
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:23,149
"Heidi!
We've gotta go on tour, you bitch"!

459
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:26,886
"We've gotta pay for mixed babies".

460
00:31:28,588 --> 00:31:31,291
We may all be dead and gone,

461
00:31:31,424 --> 00:31:34,994
Keith will still be there
with five cockroaches.

462
00:31:35,362 --> 00:31:38,365
Keith'll go, "I smoked
your uncle, did you know that"?

463
00:31:39,766 --> 00:31:42,068
"Fucking crazy..."

464
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:47,073
Every so often,
Rumsfeld comes out and goes,

465
00:31:47,107 --> 00:31:50,477
"I don't know where.
I don't know when".

466
00:31:51,778 --> 00:31:54,748
"But something awful's
going to happen".

467
00:31:54,948 --> 00:31:58,785
"Thank you, that's all for today,
no further questions".

468
00:31:58,918 --> 00:32:01,521
Excuse me, can you give me a clue?

469
00:32:01,554 --> 00:32:04,791
What is it, the Central
"Intuitive" Agency now?

470
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:08,094
Are you working with Miss Cleo?

471
00:32:11,231 --> 00:32:13,867
"I don't know where,
I don't know when,"

472
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,269
"but somethin'
awful's gonna happen"!

473
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,571
"And definitely don't
marry that fat man".

474
00:32:18,705 --> 00:32:20,473
"He only wants you
for your money, girl"!

475
00:32:21,574 --> 00:32:25,445
People are suing Miss Cleo for fraud.
I went "Fucking duh"!

476
00:32:26,813 --> 00:32:31,885
What do you want? A blind tarot
card before you go, "A-ha"!

477
00:32:32,585 --> 00:32:36,089
If she's a psychic, why does
she need a fuckin' phone number?

478
00:32:37,424 --> 00:32:39,726
Number two, that
fake Jamaican accent?

479
00:32:39,859 --> 00:32:42,362
If she was a real psychic,

480
00:32:42,395 --> 00:32:46,332
she'd be one of those Louisiana
psychics going, "You gonna die"!

481
00:32:46,733 --> 00:32:48,134
"They have to puck your ass up"

482
00:32:48,268 --> 00:32:50,704
"so they can pull a place for
your bike, come on now"!

483
00:32:51,104 --> 00:32:53,707
It's like buying hair
care products from Cher.

484
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,076
She's wearing a wig, you idiot!

485
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:00,046
Take that abdominal thing...
"Help you lose weight"

486
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:03,750
"while it shocks your fat ass
sitting watching TV".

487
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:08,355
"I'm getting six-pack abs
by knocking my testicles around"!

488
00:33:08,922 --> 00:33:11,091
You strap that to your head.

489
00:33:12,592 --> 00:33:16,529
And say, "I will not buy
stupid shit for no reason"!

490
00:33:25,572 --> 00:33:27,374
Now we are in troubled times.

491
00:33:27,407 --> 00:33:30,043
When it happened, I thought
the Statue of Liberty would change.

492
00:33:30,076 --> 00:33:31,911
Instead of "Give me your
tired and your poor,"

493
00:33:32,045 --> 00:33:34,614
it would be her with a baseball
bat going "You want a piece of me"?

494
00:33:35,315 --> 00:33:39,786
There was hardcore security.
In NY stopping people in the tunnel..

495
00:33:40,253 --> 00:33:43,423
In Washington they had F-18s
flying, air cover everywhere.

496
00:33:43,523 --> 00:33:46,493
In San Francisco,
not so hardcore security.

497
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,563
At Golden Gate Bridge there's a
Hummer, and I'm talking about the car.

498
00:33:55,101 --> 00:33:59,572
One Hummer here, two National Guardsmen,
same at the other end of the bridge.

499
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,808
The problem is that the Hummer
and the National Guardsmen

500
00:34:01,941 --> 00:34:03,743
are in jungle camouflage.

501
00:34:04,144 --> 00:34:08,415
For those who never been to SF,
the bridge is bright orange.

502
00:34:08,882 --> 00:34:13,153
So I feel like going
"Be vewy, vewy quiet".

503
00:34:13,953 --> 00:34:18,124
"We're wooking for tewwowists".

504
00:34:22,562 --> 00:34:25,198
Airport security, before
all this happened it was like,

505
00:34:25,331 --> 00:34:27,867
"Beep, OK, get
on the plane, come on".

506
00:34:29,035 --> 00:34:32,672
"What's that? Oh, that's a gun.
OK, get on the plane".

507
00:34:33,473 --> 00:34:36,943
You could carry a four inch blade,
that's about that long.

508
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:41,047
Now, you can't even carry
a nail-clipper on a plane.

509
00:34:41,348 --> 00:34:42,649
Are they afraid you're
gonna go "All right"!

510
00:34:44,284 --> 00:34:48,688
"Give me the plane
or the bitch loses a cuticle".

511
00:34:48,822 --> 00:34:53,193
"I have a nail file.
I can be irritating".

512
00:34:53,393 --> 00:34:56,963
And if you have a steak or any piece
of meat, they won't give you a knife.

513
00:34:57,263 --> 00:34:59,366
So it's like
"Quest for Fire" flight.

514
00:35:06,873 --> 00:35:09,509
"Sir, you're making a lot of noise".

515
00:35:10,143 --> 00:35:13,446
The Hindu man in the back is going
"Hold the bowl higher".

516
00:35:14,247 --> 00:35:16,549
"Don't be afraid to beg,
use your hands."

517
00:35:18,084 --> 00:35:22,122
Now the airport security is tight.
You go through the metal detector

518
00:35:22,155 --> 00:35:24,324
and if you are heavily pierced,
like some of my friends...

519
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:27,027
"Take out your keys, sir".

520
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:29,396
"Tip of the iceberg".

521
00:35:37,904 --> 00:35:42,676
For those playing the home game,
this is called a Prince Albert.

522
00:35:43,043 --> 00:35:44,878
I'm sure that was his last wish.

523
00:35:45,612 --> 00:35:48,281
I'm sure Albert said,
"Victoria, I'm dying".

524
00:35:49,215 --> 00:35:52,318
"I want you to name a
museum, a performance hall"

525
00:35:52,452 --> 00:35:54,854
"and a bolt through
the cock after me".

526
00:35:54,954 --> 00:35:58,391
"That will be Victoria's Secret.
Go, my darling".

527
00:35:59,192 --> 00:36:03,296
"Sell little thongs to people
like they had little anal floss".

528
00:36:04,064 --> 00:36:05,832
And I'm talking heavily pierced.

529
00:36:05,899 --> 00:36:07,767
Not like Britney Spears
"I'm a virgin"!

530
00:36:07,867 --> 00:36:10,303
Yeah and Michael Jackson
is a father. Move on!

531
00:36:11,104 --> 00:36:13,039
I'm talking like a hoop
through your nipple.

532
00:36:13,073 --> 00:36:15,575
You know, lady...
I'm guessing!

533
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:24,484
Just kinda the way your
clothes are going...

534
00:36:24,751 --> 00:36:29,155
When you have a big hoop, what
you're gonna do? Tie up a pony? No!

535
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:33,360
Or you have two. He's and her's
towels, whatever you want!

536
00:36:33,927 --> 00:36:35,995
A towel down here,
so you can wash up. Fun!

537
00:36:36,596 --> 00:36:40,133
It's interesting when you see a girl
with a bolt through her tongue.

538
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:41,601
Why did you do that?

539
00:36:41,735 --> 00:36:44,471
"To enahthe
the thekthual thtimulathion".

540
00:36:47,173 --> 00:36:48,808
"Nothing drives my boyfriend crazy"

541
00:36:48,942 --> 00:36:52,312
"like the feel of cold
steel on his hot rod".

542
00:36:52,712 --> 00:36:54,614
"But the problem is I ended up
knocking out all my teeth"

543
00:36:54,748 --> 00:36:57,083
"and living in a trailer park
with a man named Bubba".

544
00:36:58,184 --> 00:37:00,086
That's the trade-off, my darling.

545
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,756
You get the tatoo with
a barb wire when you're 18

546
00:37:02,889 --> 00:37:05,925
and by the time you're 80
it's fucking picket fence.

547
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:10,997
And Madonna turns into
Margaret Hamilton going,

548
00:37:11,131 --> 00:37:15,301
"I'm dying, melting".

549
00:37:15,502 --> 00:37:16,202
Here's what you wanna do.

550
00:37:16,236 --> 00:37:20,173
When I was growing up I didn't have
Playboy or Penthouse. Sad for me!

551
00:37:20,206 --> 00:37:22,108
But I had National Geographic

552
00:37:22,242 --> 00:37:24,611
and the girls that got me crazy...

553
00:37:25,545 --> 00:37:28,748
You know the ones with
the slinky neck going...

554
00:37:29,516 --> 00:37:33,720
Do that, drive your parents crazy
when you come down the stairs...

555
00:37:34,154 --> 00:37:36,089
Or do the full ubangy go,

556
00:37:36,156 --> 00:37:40,894
"Mom, dad, it's also a CD-player".

557
00:37:41,728 --> 00:37:43,997
And you can take out the plate
and jump-rope with your lower lip.

558
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,265
Have fun!

559
00:37:45,732 --> 00:37:47,767
Watch grandma go "Shit"!

560
00:37:55,108 --> 00:37:58,111
Union guys going
"Don't touch it, Mr. Williams"!

561
00:38:05,185 --> 00:38:09,255
This shit is gonna be
more precious than oil.

562
00:38:09,856 --> 00:38:12,525
Ten years from now, it's already
starting to happen. People going,

563
00:38:14,728 --> 00:38:16,396
"I got water".

564
00:38:17,097 --> 00:38:21,134
"And if you want it cold,
I got ice, motherfucker".

565
00:38:22,068 --> 00:38:27,040
Going on the planes now, a sweet
little Southern stewardess goes,

566
00:38:27,073 --> 00:38:30,343
"Ladies and gentlemen,
before we board flight five,"

567
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:33,313
"we're just gonna do a few
random bag checks".

568
00:38:33,346 --> 00:38:35,749
"These are totally random".

569
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:38,585
"I'm just gonna read off
a few names".

570
00:38:42,455 --> 00:38:44,491
"Has'N'T'Been' Seen"?

571
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,861
"Akeem Been'Laid"?

572
00:38:49,262 --> 00:38:51,197
"Have'N'T'Been Fucked"?

573
00:38:52,799 --> 00:38:54,601
"Judy Smith"?

574
00:38:54,934 --> 00:38:57,170
Fourteen arabs and a blonde...?

575
00:38:57,671 --> 00:39:01,975
And every black and Hispanic man in
the room is going "Thank you, God"!

576
00:39:02,008 --> 00:39:05,545
"Oh, yes, we're off the list,
motherfucker, yeah"!

577
00:39:08,014 --> 00:39:10,550
"They man's gonna be fucking
with you now, Habib".

578
00:39:11,484 --> 00:39:14,087
"You better learn to go orderly".

579
00:39:14,654 --> 00:39:17,724
They take the knitting needles
from the eighty-year-old lady,

580
00:39:17,757 --> 00:39:20,493
"Why, cause I'm gonna knit
an Afghan?" Give 'em to me!

581
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:23,730
And the five year old kid, they're
patting him down, he's going,

582
00:39:23,764 --> 00:39:26,966
"What are you doing?
You're not a priest, let go of me!"

583
00:39:32,806 --> 00:39:35,675
So you've had
a problem too, I guess.

584
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:37,577
Father pats little boys down, like,

585
00:39:37,711 --> 00:39:41,147
"Good game, boy, good game!
Wash up Timmy, really wash up!"

586
00:39:42,349 --> 00:39:46,786
They catch them, but they had the
divine witness protection program.

587
00:39:47,687 --> 00:39:48,922
Find the priest,
here's the pedophile,

588
00:39:49,055 --> 00:39:51,424
here's the priest,
find the pedophile...

589
00:39:56,396 --> 00:40:00,200
Don't you ask, don't you tell,
you might end up right in Hell.

590
00:40:00,633 --> 00:40:04,204
Here's your check, direct from Rome,
buy yourself a brand new home.

591
00:40:04,637 --> 00:40:08,675
Isn't it amazing?
The Pope...

592
00:40:14,147 --> 00:40:16,116
Applause break number two.

593
00:40:16,983 --> 00:40:20,353
It was amazing when the Pope gathered
all the cardinals in Rome and went...

594
00:40:21,955 --> 00:40:24,924
The only problem is, he's dressed
like Liberace's stunt double.

595
00:40:27,027 --> 00:40:28,828
I have a solution, though!

596
00:40:29,496 --> 00:40:32,799
For problem priests, a little shock
collar, going near a kid it's like,

597
00:40:32,832 --> 00:40:34,467
"You know, Timmy..."

598
00:40:36,903 --> 00:40:38,238
"Tommy, I think..."

599
00:40:39,806 --> 00:40:41,708
Or the automated confessional,
could be fun.

600
00:40:42,008 --> 00:40:44,678
"If this is a venal sin, press one".

601
00:40:45,845 --> 00:40:48,048
"If this is a carnal sin, press two".

602
00:40:48,481 --> 00:40:51,384
"If this is cardinal Law,
please stay on the line".

603
00:40:51,985 --> 00:40:56,356
"Because you have to remember,
it's not just a sin, it's a felony"!

604
00:40:56,456 --> 00:40:58,591
So we have to keep track!

605
00:41:07,567 --> 00:41:11,004
Right now they're up there watching.
"Hi, Mr. Ashcroft".

606
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:16,176
We're now under the offices
of Homeland Security.

607
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:19,879
Tom Ridge ever so often goes,
"Today is a blue day, no, orange, red"!

608
00:41:21,748 --> 00:41:24,584
They had to be very careful picking
that name "Homeland Security".

609
00:41:24,951 --> 00:41:27,220
Couldn't say Fatherland because
a lot of the old Germans are going

610
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:29,055
"That's a good one"!

611
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:33,393
But Homeland Security, it
sounds like Homefront Security,

612
00:41:33,526 --> 00:41:35,628
which was England during WWII.

613
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:39,666
Old men with pitchforks and colostomy
bags, defending England!

614
00:41:40,133 --> 00:41:42,535
There they were,
Rudolph has personally...

615
00:41:42,669 --> 00:41:45,472
"I threw my colostomy bag,
covered him in shite"

616
00:41:45,605 --> 00:41:48,274
and said "Get out of that fokker,
you fucker, get out"!

617
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:53,446
And I also find out now,
that Winston Churchill,

618
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,915
one of the greatest
orators of all time,

619
00:41:55,949 --> 00:42:00,353
may have been so fucked
up on cognac and champagne,

620
00:42:00,387 --> 00:42:02,956
that he didn't do some
of his great speeches.

621
00:42:02,989 --> 00:42:08,094
They were done by a man from the BBC,
who also did "Winnie the Pooh".

622
00:42:08,895 --> 00:42:13,466
"We will fight them on the beaches,
in the air, on the land"!

623
00:42:13,633 --> 00:42:15,135
"Eeyore and Tigger"!

624
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:19,973
And, he was fighting against Hitler!

625
00:42:20,206 --> 00:42:22,842
A man who recently a book
declared was a homosexual,

626
00:42:22,876 --> 00:42:24,744
and I always thought
this was a clue!

627
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:28,081
That and the leather and the dancing!

628
00:42:31,151 --> 00:42:33,520
We are now finding ourselves
once again drown to England

629
00:42:33,653 --> 00:42:34,521
during these troubled times.

630
00:42:34,654 --> 00:42:36,322
Tony Blair, a militant liberal.

631
00:42:36,456 --> 00:42:39,426
Over here, George W. Bush,
compassionate conservative.

632
00:42:39,826 --> 00:42:42,896
Sounds kinda like a Volvo
with a gun rack, but...

633
00:42:45,031 --> 00:42:49,069
Over here, Tony Blair, a man who
must adress the House of Commons,

634
00:42:49,202 --> 00:42:52,005
which is like Congress, with a
two drink minimum, crazy place!

635
00:42:53,473 --> 00:42:56,843
- I believe my worthy opponents...
- Oh, fuck off!

636
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:59,979
"Shite, bollocks, you bastard!
Fuck you"!

637
00:43:00,113 --> 00:43:02,015
Would someone remove
Ms. Tatcher from the chamber?

638
00:43:05,552 --> 00:43:09,022
Tony said, "This heinous
incident has brought us"

639
00:43:09,155 --> 00:43:10,123
"to the edge of oblivion..."

640
00:43:10,323 --> 00:43:12,425
"But our civilization shall endure"!

641
00:43:12,492 --> 00:43:16,629
And there's poor W. going,
"Shit, I can't even spell that".

642
00:43:18,531 --> 00:43:22,068
Cause you look at Bush
and you realize it's Bush 2.0.

643
00:43:23,203 --> 00:43:26,873
It's a beta release. He came with
certain bugs in the software.

644
00:43:27,273 --> 00:43:29,376
"This country will
not be taken hostile,"

645
00:43:29,509 --> 00:43:31,945
oops, delete, delete, "hostage".

646
00:43:33,413 --> 00:43:36,850
And you look at him and realize
he has a short attention spam.

647
00:43:36,883 --> 00:43:40,653
"Our economy is going...
oh, look at the kitty".

648
00:43:43,189 --> 00:43:46,626
He kinda reminds me of the guy in
college with a towel going, "Gotcha"!

649
00:43:49,162 --> 00:43:50,730
You just don't want him to drive.

650
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:54,267
Some men are born great,
some achieve greatness,

651
00:43:54,401 --> 00:43:57,103
some get it as a graduation gift.
That's OK!

652
00:43:57,971 --> 00:44:00,173
Historically...

653
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:06,146
You must look at it
from a historical perspective.

654
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,314
He's George the second.
The boy-king.

655
00:44:08,348 --> 00:44:10,950
A man we thought could
only lose, but somehow won,

656
00:44:11,084 --> 00:44:13,453
because of confused Hebrews.
Yes!

657
00:44:15,855 --> 00:44:21,127
W. doesn't speak while Channey's
drinking water. Check that shit out!

658
00:44:26,466 --> 00:44:27,400
When everything went down,

659
00:44:27,534 --> 00:44:29,836
they put W. out there, but
they protected Channey.

660
00:44:30,804 --> 00:44:34,774
Channey had an angioplasty.
Most people wait 'til it heals.

661
00:44:34,908 --> 00:44:37,210
He was like,
"I'm perfectly fine"!

662
00:44:38,011 --> 00:44:40,513
"I'm OK"!

663
00:44:41,348 --> 00:44:45,785
And there's Ashcroft in the back,
"Work the arms, you asshole"!

664
00:44:46,386 --> 00:44:50,390
You have to remember,
John Ashcroft is a man

665
00:44:50,523 --> 00:44:53,159
who lost to a dead man in Missouri.

666
00:44:53,793 --> 00:44:58,965
Choices in Missouri were
John Ashcroft, Dead Man.

667
00:44:59,566 --> 00:45:01,167
And people in Missouri went,

668
00:45:01,267 --> 00:45:05,905
"I'm sorry John, the dead man
scares me less than you do".

669
00:45:13,013 --> 00:45:15,315
Here's the drill for me.
You know what's strange?

670
00:45:18,651 --> 00:45:21,154
It doesn't scare me that
W. waved at Stevie Wonder.

671
00:45:21,287 --> 00:45:23,256
That's OK.

672
00:45:26,893 --> 00:45:29,162
Stevie's only been blind since birth!

673
00:45:29,729 --> 00:45:31,865
And there's W. going,
"Stevie"!

674
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:36,336
Even Stevie Wonder's going,
"Is that motherfucker waving at me"?

675
00:45:38,104 --> 00:45:42,642
"Does he think I'm looking
for him? Goddamn"!

676
00:45:43,877 --> 00:45:46,246
No! What scares me,

677
00:45:46,379 --> 00:45:50,016
is that W. almost died
from a fucking pretzel.

678
00:45:51,484 --> 00:45:53,787
We have billions of
dollars in national defense.

679
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,090
They want billions more
for national security.

680
00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:00,694
And he almost fucking goes
down from snack food!

681
00:46:01,361 --> 00:46:04,531
Secret Service are going
"Game's over, man"!

682
00:46:04,564 --> 00:46:07,767
"Gilligan's down.
Gilligan's down".

683
00:46:09,369 --> 00:46:12,505
"Step away from the chip, sir"!

684
00:46:13,773 --> 00:46:16,943
We have to have people go
"Hydrate, you bastard"!

685
00:46:18,411 --> 00:46:21,548
His own dogs didnt' give a shit.
They were licking him for the salt.

686
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,055
You need a dog that cares.
A dog like Lassie, who'd go...

687
00:46:33,226 --> 00:46:35,095
"What's wrong, Lassie?
The President swallowed something"

688
00:46:35,228 --> 00:46:36,096
"and you did the Heimlich"?

689
00:46:37,597 --> 00:46:39,165
"What else, girl"?

690
00:46:40,934 --> 00:46:44,237
"Mr. Channey is meeting
with the Enron people"?

691
00:46:46,172 --> 00:46:49,943
"An Enron employee
is secretary of the Navy"?

692
00:46:50,443 --> 00:46:51,611
"What about the Harken loan"?

693
00:46:52,312 --> 00:46:55,081
"Sorry, girl, we gonna
have to put you down".

694
00:46:55,882 --> 00:47:01,054
Oh, Kenny Boy.
The Feds, the Feds are coming.

695
00:47:01,087 --> 00:47:04,391
Welcome, boys and girls,
to Disney's new ride.

696
00:47:04,524 --> 00:47:07,093
Investment pirates of the Caribbean.

697
00:47:08,161 --> 00:47:11,064
Your money checks in,
it doesn't check out.

698
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:17,070
Sometimes you catch George unprepared
and he says unusual things.

699
00:47:17,437 --> 00:47:23,176
- Mr. Bush, what are we gonna do?
- We're gonna conduct a crusade.

700
00:47:23,309 --> 00:47:26,012
And everybody in the room went...

701
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:28,412
Ix-nay on the ucrade-say!

702
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:36,056
All throughout the Middle East...

703
00:47:36,122 --> 00:47:39,492
Hide the women and children and
the number zero, they're coming!

704
00:47:39,959 --> 00:47:42,796
And you can't bomb the Afghanis
back to the stone age

705
00:47:42,929 --> 00:47:44,831
because they'll go
"Upgrade. Fun"!

706
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,904
Today's bombing raid has enlarged the
hole from yesterday's bombing raid.

707
00:47:51,071 --> 00:47:53,807
We have moved trouble
from here, to here.

708
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,843
Goat in the upper right corner,
possible member of the Taliban,

709
00:47:56,976 --> 00:47:59,145
or "concubine", we're not sure.

710
00:47:59,279 --> 00:48:02,515
We did fire the 100 million dollars cruise
missile up its ass and were successful.

711
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:06,319
Operation "Extreme Redundancy"
is carrying on!

712
00:48:07,687 --> 00:48:12,892
Then we started to drop bombs,
food, food, bombs.

713
00:48:13,026 --> 00:48:14,327
And here's the fun part.

714
00:48:14,361 --> 00:48:16,863
Some of the bombs were
little yellow bombs,

715
00:48:16,996 --> 00:48:19,666
and the food packages were
little yellow packages.

716
00:48:19,733 --> 00:48:22,936
So now you're playing
"Survivor The Real Game".

717
00:48:23,303 --> 00:48:27,574
"OK Bob, I was here yesterday...
I'm gonna go for this one today..."

718
00:48:28,508 --> 00:48:30,777
And what was in those packages?

719
00:48:31,878 --> 00:48:33,413
Pop-Tarts, peanut butter,

720
00:48:33,446 --> 00:48:36,850
and all you need is honey-baked ham
and you got a Redneck Christmas.

721
00:48:39,285 --> 00:48:41,488
Who dropped the honey-baked ham
on the Muslims?

722
00:48:44,024 --> 00:48:48,161
Why are we dropping Pop-Tarts
and peanut butter on Afghanistan?

723
00:48:48,194 --> 00:48:50,430
Number one, it tastes a shit load
better than dirt.

724
00:48:52,132 --> 00:48:53,566
Number two and more importantly,

725
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,702
very difficult
to have a call to Jihad

726
00:48:55,835 --> 00:48:58,071
with a mouth full of peanut butter.

727
00:49:04,878 --> 00:49:08,448
Secondly, or thirdly,
for those keeping track...

728
00:49:09,849 --> 00:49:13,453
Afghanistan is a hasheesh
smoking culture.

729
00:49:13,653 --> 00:49:16,089
And everyone who's ever been
a friend of the Hooka will go,

730
00:49:16,656 --> 00:49:18,925
"Pop-Tarts"!

731
00:49:26,332 --> 00:49:30,203
Yes! Got milk?
Come and get me!

732
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:33,807
We're trying to win hearts
and minds. How do we do that?

733
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:37,644
Do we build an amusement park
"Muslim Mountain" with Gadafi Duck? No!

734
00:49:39,346 --> 00:49:42,048
Do we have a wet burger contest? No!

735
00:49:42,682 --> 00:49:46,653
Do we play Cat Stevens
records all day? Fuck off!

736
00:49:46,886 --> 00:49:48,655
Drop Martha Stuart's tits? No!

737
00:49:49,589 --> 00:49:52,726
Do we have a children show
called "Saudi Dudi"? No!

738
00:49:54,494 --> 00:49:58,932
What we must do is we gotta get
a sister. You know what I'm sayin'?

739
00:49:59,265 --> 00:50:01,468
You gotta get a sister from Brooklyn.

740
00:50:01,868 --> 00:50:04,304
You know what I mean, a-ha, girl?
You know what I'm sayin'?

741
00:50:04,571 --> 00:50:07,474
One of those bitches you
see on Jerry Springer.

742
00:50:07,974 --> 00:50:10,143
Drop her ass in Kabul and she'll go,

743
00:50:10,276 --> 00:50:14,614
"Girl, you don't have to dress
like a mother fucking bee keeper"!

744
00:50:17,384 --> 00:50:21,054
"You don't have to be
Casper's bitch, forget all that"!

745
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:25,558
"If he picks up a rock, cause
you're talking to another man,"

746
00:50:25,692 --> 00:50:29,596
you pick a bigger rock and say
"Shit has hit the fan, motherfucker"!

747
00:50:31,064 --> 00:50:33,266
"He tries to cut off your clitoris,
make you a Barbie doll,"

748
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:36,369
you grab a knife and say
"Lorena Bobbit time"!

749
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:40,373
"Don't make me go cobra, I will go
Oprah on your ass. Don't make me"!

750
00:50:41,408 --> 00:50:43,543
We're dealing with fundamentalists...

751
00:50:43,743 --> 00:50:45,145
The Amish are fundamentalists,
but they don't try

752
00:50:45,278 --> 00:50:46,913
and hijack a carriage at needlepoint.

753
00:50:47,614 --> 00:50:50,550
And, if you're ever in Amish
country and you see a man

754
00:50:50,717 --> 00:50:53,687
with his hand buried in a
horse's ass, that's a mechanic.

755
00:50:56,823 --> 00:50:59,325
Who are we looking for?

756
00:51:00,226 --> 00:51:02,796
Ossama Bin Laden, one of 52 children.

757
00:51:02,929 --> 00:51:05,465
Even Freud would say,
"He has issues".

758
00:51:06,066 --> 00:51:07,934
What does he look
like without the beard?

759
00:51:08,068 --> 00:51:10,970
Howard Stern, Barbra Streisand?
I don't know, I don't care!

760
00:51:11,204 --> 00:51:15,175
I know this he's a six foot five
Arab on dialysis...

761
00:51:15,442 --> 00:51:17,877
Why is that so fucking hard to find?

762
00:51:18,511 --> 00:51:23,783
Look for somebody attached
to their luggage.

763
00:51:25,452 --> 00:51:30,090
When you see the tapes
of him, you see a psychopath.

764
00:51:31,224 --> 00:51:34,227
Wait a minute.
We have some of our own!

765
00:51:34,828 --> 00:51:37,564
Theodor Kasinsky, sitting around
with nothing to do.

766
00:51:37,997 --> 00:51:40,834
Ted's played "A Beautiful Mind",
the home game.

767
00:51:41,634 --> 00:51:45,071
You give Ted a mailing list
and some tools...

768
00:51:45,238 --> 00:51:46,873
Ted, these people have been bad.

769
00:51:47,007 --> 00:51:49,342
- Are they bad?
- Very bad!

770
00:51:49,376 --> 00:51:53,113
- I just want a few things.
- I know you do!

771
00:51:53,646 --> 00:51:57,784
Or we get Charles Manson. Great
organizer, incredible with chicks.

772
00:51:57,917 --> 00:51:59,386
You can't use him.

773
00:51:59,452 --> 00:52:01,521
Chucky all the time
comes out for parole

774
00:52:01,654 --> 00:52:04,124
with a swastika on his forehead.

775
00:52:04,157 --> 00:52:06,493
- I'm better.
- In many ways, yeah.

776
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,029
- What would you do if you got out?
- I'd kill everybody.

777
00:52:11,631 --> 00:52:13,633
What are we dealing with?

778
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,470
One of the fundamental
things is in a Jihad.

779
00:52:17,704 --> 00:52:20,974
Sounds like a country
western term like "jee-ha"!

780
00:52:22,075 --> 00:52:24,678
And if you are in a Jihad
and you kill an infidel

781
00:52:24,744 --> 00:52:26,646
which, I'm sad to say, is all of us,

782
00:52:27,247 --> 00:52:28,915
and you yourself die...

783
00:52:29,049 --> 00:52:30,450
you go to heaven
and you are greated

784
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:32,385
by 71 dark-haired virgins.

785
00:52:33,053 --> 00:52:34,587
Now everyone who's ever been
with one virgin is going...

786
00:52:34,721 --> 00:52:36,756
"I don't know..."

787
00:52:38,558 --> 00:52:40,393
"For my talent portion..."

788
00:52:43,263 --> 00:52:45,999
Recently, there was a
article in the New York Times,

789
00:52:46,132 --> 00:52:47,600
a Coran scholar said

790
00:52:47,734 --> 00:52:50,370
"The actual translation is not
71 dark-haired virgins,"

791
00:52:50,503 --> 00:52:53,707
"but 71 crystal clear raisins".

792
00:52:57,143 --> 00:53:00,046
Slight difference in
interpretation, really.

793
00:53:00,647 --> 00:53:04,284
It's like finding out "thou shalt not
kill" is "thou shalt not wear a kilt".

794
00:53:05,318 --> 00:53:08,355
And the Scotish are going,
"Fuck off"!

795
00:53:08,888 --> 00:53:12,292
Imagine some guy blows himself up,
goes to the gates of Heaven sayin',

796
00:53:12,325 --> 00:53:15,295
- Where are my bitches?
- Here're your raisins.

797
00:53:16,529 --> 00:53:20,200
Or 71 Virgils going,
"You got a pretty mouth"!

798
00:53:22,402 --> 00:53:25,372
Ossama Bin Laden goes
to the gates of Heaven,

799
00:53:25,505 --> 00:53:26,306
there's George Washington waiting,

800
00:53:26,439 --> 00:53:28,575
"How dare you defile that
what we created"

801
00:53:28,708 --> 00:53:30,276
and starts violating on his ass.

802
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:34,681
70 other members of the Congress
start kicking the shit outta him.

803
00:53:34,714 --> 00:53:36,583
And then he's going,
"Where're the virgins"?

804
00:53:36,716 --> 00:53:39,586
"71 Virginians, you asshole"!

805
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:46,159
"I must talk to Jesus Christ"!

806
00:53:46,326 --> 00:53:48,294
"Where is Jesus Christ"?

807
00:53:48,428 --> 00:53:52,265
And Saint Peter goes,
"Hey, Jesus, did you call a cab"?

808
00:53:56,436 --> 00:53:59,873
I heard it. Finally the PCs.

809
00:54:00,006 --> 00:54:01,641
We crossed
the politically correct line.

810
00:54:01,775 --> 00:54:04,744
It's OK to beat the shit out of them,
but don't do the Ethnic joke.

811
00:54:08,948 --> 00:54:10,684
How Buddhist of you!

812
00:54:11,151 --> 00:54:12,719
Remember when they
destroyed the two Buddhas?

813
00:54:12,852 --> 00:54:14,621
What did Buddha do?
Nothing!

814
00:54:14,988 --> 00:54:16,756
What does the Buddhist terrorist do?

815
00:54:16,923 --> 00:54:20,326
Goes in the middle of the street,
takes the gas... Self barbecue!

816
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,063
People're killing each other
in the name of God're going,

817
00:54:23,196 --> 00:54:24,364
"What the fuck are you doing"?

818
00:54:25,165 --> 00:54:27,133
"Making you deal
with your shit".

819
00:54:27,267 --> 00:54:30,103
I don't understand the whole
fundamentalist thing.

820
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:32,105
I'm an Episcopal.
That's catholic light.

821
00:54:34,174 --> 00:54:37,844
Same religion, half the guilt.
It's frightening.

822
00:54:38,278 --> 00:54:40,680
Catholics have confession,
episcopals have

823
00:54:40,814 --> 00:54:43,983
Thanks Giving, your dad
has a couple of gin and tonics...

824
00:54:45,118 --> 00:54:47,854
"I never loved you mother,
you know that, don't ya"!?

825
00:54:48,855 --> 00:54:52,092
"I didn't, dad. And she's
right there. Tell her again".

826
00:54:53,893 --> 00:54:58,665
Episcopal is basicly Church of
England which was Henry the 8th

827
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:01,968
breaking away from the Catholic Church
going, "I'm the fucking Pope now"!

828
00:55:03,002 --> 00:55:05,772
Then people broke
away from that church,

829
00:55:05,905 --> 00:55:08,575
the Calvinists found him
to be too loose.

830
00:55:08,775 --> 00:55:13,013
Then the Puritans broke away from
the Calvinists, our ancestors,

831
00:55:13,046 --> 00:55:16,216
people so uptight, the
English kicked them out.

832
00:55:16,249 --> 00:55:21,554
How anal do you have to be for the
English to go "Get the fuck out"!

833
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:24,958
"Take your pimp shoes and go"!

834
00:55:25,525 --> 00:55:28,328
And they land here in
America going "Hello"!

835
00:55:28,461 --> 00:55:31,831
"We bring you guilt,
syphilis and alcohol".

836
00:55:32,232 --> 00:55:34,667
"Here chief, try this
and once you drunk it,"

837
00:55:34,801 --> 00:55:37,237
"keep moving towards your
feathers float. There you go"!

838
00:55:37,837 --> 00:55:40,607
And the Indians go
"We have a gift for you".

839
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:45,345
"For us is a sacred herb. For you
it will be an addictive carcinogen".

840
00:55:45,945 --> 00:55:51,718
"Tobacco is a lot of fun.
And a good cash crop, yeah".

841
00:55:59,826 --> 00:56:03,930
"Welcome to Custers.
The Casino that cares".

842
00:56:04,164 --> 00:56:07,133
"This is my wife,
Sits-with-a-full-house".

843
00:56:07,934 --> 00:56:10,136
"It is now time for the
white man to get drunk,"

844
00:56:10,236 --> 00:56:12,639
"and we'll get back the land
you took from us".

845
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:19,612
The Puritans stayed here
and groups broke away from them

846
00:56:19,746 --> 00:56:22,816
and then we got the people
who knock on your door

847
00:56:22,949 --> 00:56:24,617
at 6:30 in the morning
on Sunday going,

848
00:56:24,751 --> 00:56:27,153
"Have you found Jesus"?

849
00:56:27,487 --> 00:56:29,155
You just wanna come to
the door nude and go

850
00:56:29,289 --> 00:56:31,791
"No, help me look for him!
Come on"!

851
00:56:35,295 --> 00:56:38,631
People like Pat Robinson
and Jerry Falwell say

852
00:56:38,798 --> 00:56:40,767
"This was brought upon
us by our sinful ways".

853
00:56:40,934 --> 00:56:43,370
I wanna put them on a plane,
take them to the ayatollah

854
00:56:43,536 --> 00:56:45,905
and have world wide
fundamentalist wrestling.

855
00:56:46,172 --> 00:56:50,710
"One time only. A life after death
match for all of our souls".

856
00:56:50,944 --> 00:56:53,513
"Let's get ready to humble"!

857
00:56:53,713 --> 00:56:57,384
Here's the drill. Fundamentalists
take it to be "the word".

858
00:56:57,517 --> 00:57:00,153
Not translatable, not metaphorical,
"the word".

859
00:57:00,487 --> 00:57:03,723
In the Genesis, "Let there be light"!
Could that be a metaphor for the Big Bang?

860
00:57:03,757 --> 00:57:05,825
"No. God just went click".

861
00:57:07,927 --> 00:57:11,464
We are all descendant from Adam
and Eve, then we are all cousins?

862
00:57:11,531 --> 00:57:13,066
"That's right"!

863
00:57:17,971 --> 00:57:20,106
There are miracles in the Bible.

864
00:57:20,273 --> 00:57:24,144
Like when Moses, and I'm not
talking "Guns 'N' Moses", no!

865
00:57:24,744 --> 00:57:25,745
Not Charlton Heston going,

866
00:57:25,879 --> 00:57:28,515
"Let the Jews go or the pharaoh
gets two in the head"!

867
00:57:29,349 --> 00:57:30,550
Charlton Heston,
a man who said,

868
00:57:30,717 --> 00:57:34,554
"Guns don't kill people.
Apes with guns kill people".

869
00:57:35,188 --> 00:57:37,824
No, Chucky! The second amendment

870
00:57:37,924 --> 00:57:40,093
started from people
going like this...

871
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:41,761
And that still continues.
That's OK!

872
00:57:42,095 --> 00:57:46,232
When Moses said to pharaoh
"Let my people go".

873
00:57:46,266 --> 00:57:48,468
And pharaoh went
"In your dreams"!

874
00:57:48,535 --> 00:57:52,072
And Moses called the God,
"God, I need some help"!

875
00:57:52,105 --> 00:57:54,974
And frogs fell from the sky.

876
00:57:55,442 --> 00:57:59,312
Or maybe there were Jews
with catapults going "Now"!

877
00:58:00,413 --> 00:58:05,452
Thank God it wasn't the French,
cause they would go "Lunch"!

878
00:58:05,885 --> 00:58:09,956
"You're great caterers, I can't
let you go, you crazy people"!

879
00:58:11,191 --> 00:58:16,529
Frogs fell from the sky. I would
be going "Get your shit and out"!

880
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:20,333
I said wait a minute! That's what
we should drop on Afghanistan.

881
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:24,037
Not bombs, not food...
Fucking frogs!

882
00:58:24,304 --> 00:58:27,173
Frogs, lizards, hamsters, gerbils,
shit they haven't seen.

883
00:58:28,375 --> 00:58:32,679
If you wanna get people out
of caves, a shit load of NY rats.

884
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:41,755
NY rats would be going
"Hey, come on, raid"!

885
00:58:41,788 --> 00:58:44,024
"I eat pussy literarly.
Bring it on"!

886
00:58:45,525 --> 00:58:50,196
Even then pharaoh was not impressed
"Please, David Copperfield, no"!

887
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:52,766
And then boils and
then first born dies.

888
00:58:52,899 --> 00:58:55,435
"That's it! Hebrews get out"!

889
00:58:55,468 --> 00:58:56,403
And everybody...

890
00:58:58,505 --> 00:59:00,306
"Let's not wait for the bread to rise".

891
00:59:00,473 --> 00:59:03,610
"Just get the crackers and the skin
off your penis, we're leaving"!

892
00:59:05,345 --> 00:59:07,247
Excuse me! Why the skin
off the penis?

893
00:59:07,414 --> 00:59:10,150
"We're travelling, people.
You don't want sand in there".

894
00:59:11,251 --> 00:59:14,788
"And this is so passe! The dicky
thing, forget it. Let's move"!

895
00:59:15,321 --> 00:59:17,490
We're going to the desert.
Then they get the 10 commandments,

896
00:59:17,657 --> 00:59:20,160
that would be ajusted later
by certain presidents.

897
00:59:21,361 --> 00:59:23,797
And they get to the Red Sea.

898
00:59:23,963 --> 00:59:27,534
And they go "What now,
Mr. Magic, what do we do now"?

899
00:59:27,634 --> 00:59:30,670
We're gonna walk on the
"fregs bocks", the "frogs bucks"...

900
00:59:30,804 --> 00:59:32,305
Frogs backs!

901
00:59:32,772 --> 00:59:35,775
Thank you for watching me this far.

902
00:59:36,876 --> 00:59:39,612
Obviously, I did inhale.

903
00:59:43,316 --> 00:59:45,485
"What do we do now, Mr. Big Shot"?

904
00:59:45,552 --> 00:59:49,189
And he calls to God again
and the sea parts.

905
00:59:49,589 --> 00:59:52,926
And even the most doubting
Jew is going "You're good"!

906
00:59:53,193 --> 00:59:58,865
Let's move, don't eat the shellfish,
I'll tell you why later.

907
01:00:00,066 --> 01:00:01,234
Where are we going?

908
01:00:01,401 --> 01:00:03,870
"To Jerusalem to start
years of struggling,"

909
01:00:04,004 --> 01:00:06,973
"and later to Miami
to fuck up an election".

910
01:00:11,644 --> 01:00:15,115
And then the pharaoh comes, the sea
closes and he calls to his cat-like God

911
01:00:15,148 --> 01:00:19,119
but the cat-like God can't do shit,
cause it's afraid of water.

912
01:00:22,756 --> 01:00:25,291
And then there's another miracle.

913
01:00:25,725 --> 01:00:30,463
The night that Mary said to Joe
"Joe, I'm pregnant".

914
01:00:30,997 --> 01:00:34,134
Joe went "Holy Mother of God"!
She went "You're right"!

915
01:00:35,769 --> 01:00:39,439
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- What a great name, Joe!

916
01:00:39,873 --> 01:00:42,842
"That is so much better
than Shmul. Way to go"!

917
01:00:43,243 --> 01:00:45,812
- I love you, Joe!
- Hold on a minute, Mary.

918
01:00:45,845 --> 01:00:48,081
- So I'm the step father of God's kid?
- Yeah.

919
01:00:48,314 --> 01:00:50,316
"I can't discipline him,
I can't tell him he's wrong,"

920
01:00:50,483 --> 01:00:53,253
cause he'll look to me saying
"You're not my real dad".

921
01:00:53,453 --> 01:00:55,855
- How did it happen?
- It's immaculate, Joe.

922
01:00:56,089 --> 01:01:00,193
"It better be, Mary!
It better be immaculate"!

923
01:01:00,226 --> 01:01:04,864
I'm sorry I'm transforming
Joe into Ralph Cramdon.

924
01:01:07,133 --> 01:01:11,471
Up to that point, all the names
in the Bible are very Jewish.

925
01:01:11,504 --> 01:01:15,975
You have Noah, Moses, Zebedee
and then you get Mary and Joe.

926
01:01:16,009 --> 01:01:19,679
We're just a hyphenate away
from Mary-Jean and Joe-Bob.

927
01:01:20,313 --> 01:01:23,283
We could've had Jim Bob,
the son of God.

928
01:01:23,983 --> 01:01:26,886
Praise to him, Jim-Bob.

929
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:32,559
He, who finds the stuff
And gets me a job, Jim-Bob!

930
01:01:32,826 --> 01:01:37,130
Jesus was an only child.
Thank God!

931
01:01:37,297 --> 01:01:40,367
Who would want to be Jerry,
the brother of Christ?

932
01:01:42,469 --> 01:01:44,637
That's a tough gig.

933
01:01:44,804 --> 01:01:46,172
"Come on, Jerry,
we're going to the beach".

934
01:01:46,206 --> 01:01:49,376
"Jesus's gonna walk on the water,
feed everybody, heal them"

935
01:01:49,542 --> 01:01:50,844
"and get a whole buch
of disciples".

936
01:01:50,877 --> 01:01:54,147
"I'll sat there with a rash and sand
in my ass. Great day for me"!

937
01:01:56,583 --> 01:02:01,721
He ends up in a bar at the age of 30 going
"Yeah, I'm Jerry Christ, whoo-dee-doo"!

938
01:02:03,957 --> 01:02:08,728
"Yeah, I healed sombody. Come
here Spot, heel! Look at that"!

939
01:02:10,764 --> 01:02:15,168
"Jesus is a carpenter, I'm
a plumber. You do the math"!

940
01:02:16,336 --> 01:02:19,873
And people say to me Jesus wasn't
Jewish. Of course he was Jewish!

941
01:02:20,407 --> 01:02:23,309
Thirty years old, single, living
at home with his parents, come on.

942
01:02:24,344 --> 01:02:25,745
Working in his father's business,

943
01:02:25,912 --> 01:02:28,715
his mother thought he was
God's gift, he's Jewish! Give it up!

944
01:02:30,283 --> 01:02:32,052
It's an old tradition!

945
01:02:33,053 --> 01:02:36,122
And if he was Jewish, and many
of his Disciples were Jewish,

946
01:02:36,289 --> 01:02:39,726
for the Last Supper, would they
have not gone out for Chinese?

947
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:43,263
"Welcome to Yah-Weh. Hold on
one minute, no service, no sandals".

948
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:44,464
"OK, you come in now".

949
01:02:44,597 --> 01:02:49,135
"You're twelve. All I got is two
tables of six. They're not together".

950
01:02:49,769 --> 01:02:55,275
"I got one big table by the window,
but you all have to face this way".

951
01:02:59,045 --> 01:03:03,283
"You are glowing, so I guess we won't
need that lamp, that's very nice"!

952
01:03:03,683 --> 01:03:07,120
"You've just turned a Szechwan chicken
into a live chicken, you very good!"

953
01:03:08,688 --> 01:03:12,892
It's said that night, Jesus
turned to his disciples,

954
01:03:13,059 --> 01:03:15,295
and said "One of you
shall betray me".

955
01:03:15,462 --> 01:03:18,798
Peter said, "Is it me, Jesus"?
Jesus said, "It is not you Peter".

956
01:03:19,132 --> 01:03:22,836
Simon said, "Is it me, Jesus"?
Jesus said, "It is not you Simon".

957
01:03:23,269 --> 01:03:24,838
And Judas said
"Is it me, Jesus"?

958
01:03:24,905 --> 01:03:28,108
And Jesus turned to him
"Is it me, Jesus"!?

959
01:03:29,809 --> 01:03:31,678
Thus you see
two traditions beginning

960
01:03:31,811 --> 01:03:35,648
Jewish sarcasm and gentile
humor. Together born!

961
01:03:36,316 --> 01:03:40,954
The next day the miracle occured.
Crucifixion, Resurrection,

962
01:03:40,987 --> 01:03:43,690
and he rose again from the
dead and if he sees his shadow

963
01:03:43,857 --> 01:03:45,992
another 2,000 years of guilt.
Yes!

964
01:03:46,926 --> 01:03:51,664
For me, the one big question is how
do you get Crucifixion, Resurrection

965
01:03:51,731 --> 01:03:54,768
and then chocholate bunnies,
coloured eggs?

966
01:03:56,536 --> 01:03:57,971
How do you do that one?

967
01:03:58,638 --> 01:04:02,242
Even kids are going "Rabbits
don't lay eggs. What is this"?

968
01:04:02,842 --> 01:04:06,212
And you don't want a kid bitting
the head off a chocholate Jesus.

969
01:04:07,347 --> 01:04:10,850
You don't want a cream
filled cross going...

970
01:04:11,551 --> 01:04:13,553
You don't wanna put raspberry
jam in the grass going

971
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:15,722
"We're looking for Jesus,
kids, come one"!

972
01:04:16,556 --> 01:04:19,592
What are we trying to do?
You're trying to keep them involved.

973
01:04:19,893 --> 01:04:22,729
That's why we have all the saints
that did all those amazing things.

974
01:04:24,330 --> 01:04:26,599
They're all there
to keep your action up.

975
01:04:27,267 --> 01:04:29,335
And then we're starting
to lose them.

976
01:04:29,369 --> 01:04:30,470
Like Saint Christopher...

977
01:04:30,637 --> 01:04:33,673
"Chris, sorry, babe.
Dashboard sales are down".

978
01:04:35,608 --> 01:04:36,710
"The medals aren't selling well".

979
01:04:36,843 --> 01:04:40,046
"Drop the kid off your back, pick
up your stuff, you're outta here".

980
01:04:40,146 --> 01:04:42,882
"We're gonna have Saint Prada,
all ladies accesories".

981
01:04:44,317 --> 01:04:47,387
But I want a saint
like Mother Teresa.

982
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:51,491
She said "You can do only
small things with great love".

983
01:04:51,524 --> 01:04:53,993
And Pat Robinson said
"She's not a real Christian"!

984
01:04:54,027 --> 01:04:57,630
"Why? Cause she doesn't have
tag shelther and a university"?

985
01:04:58,264 --> 01:05:02,268
Mother Teresa never had a line
of products, her own perfume...

986
01:05:02,535 --> 01:05:05,405
"Compassion" by Mother Teresa.

987
01:05:05,572 --> 01:05:08,608
"I smell, because I care.
Compassion"!

988
01:05:09,209 --> 01:05:11,745
Gandhi never had "Gandhi Jeans"...

989
01:05:12,479 --> 01:05:16,683
"Whether you're simply not eating or
telling the English to get the fuck out"!

990
01:05:17,283 --> 01:05:20,053
"They come in size one and below".

991
01:05:21,354 --> 01:05:23,623
Gandhi was an amazing man.

992
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:25,759
They asked him "What do you
think about Western civilization"?

993
01:05:25,959 --> 01:05:28,495
He said "I think it would
be a wonderful idea".

994
01:05:29,162 --> 01:05:34,467
As beatific as Gandhi was, there
was somebody in a Bombay bar going

995
01:05:35,135 --> 01:05:38,838
"I know Gandhi.
He was a prick".

996
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:44,010
"I saw him sucking on a pork hot-dog,
hitting on Mother Teresa".

997
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:47,747
"He kept saying
Who's your diaper daddy"?

998
01:05:50,083 --> 01:05:51,518
"I saw that with my eyes".

999
01:05:51,651 --> 01:05:55,055
"If you don't believe me, I'll
bitch slap you like Shiva".

1000
01:05:56,556 --> 01:05:59,693
"Don't press this.
Don't fucking do that"!

1001
01:06:00,093 --> 01:06:02,162
"Don't go ding-dong,
you asshole"!

1002
01:06:03,096 --> 01:06:04,864
"Cause India has the
atomic bomb, my friend".

1003
01:06:05,031 --> 01:06:07,867
"I could turn this whole
place into Chicken Tika".

1004
01:06:08,568 --> 01:06:10,370
India has the bomb.
Pakistan has the bomb.

1005
01:06:10,403 --> 01:06:12,072
And we're prepared
to fight over Kashmir.

1006
01:06:12,238 --> 01:06:15,642
And your president probably thought
it was a sweater. What an asshole!

1007
01:06:17,243 --> 01:06:21,448
India detonated
700 ground nuclear tests.

1008
01:06:21,614 --> 01:06:23,850
Pakistan detonated
700 ground nuclear tests.

1009
01:06:24,117 --> 01:06:26,619
And your spy satelites were
like Ray Charles in the Louvre.

1010
01:06:26,786 --> 01:06:28,588
They didn't have a fucking clue.

1011
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:33,026
India has the bomb.
Pakistan has the bomb.

1012
01:06:33,159 --> 01:06:34,094
China has the bomb.

1013
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:37,664
Or maybe they just have one
billion people go "Boom"!

1014
01:06:38,365 --> 01:06:42,402
Russia has the bomb.
"We have many bombs".

1015
01:06:43,269 --> 01:06:45,905
"We don't know
where they all are"!

1016
01:06:47,707 --> 01:06:50,510
Maybe you want a dirty bomb.

1017
01:06:52,112 --> 01:06:54,748
And the French have a bomb, too.

1018
01:06:55,015 --> 01:06:57,751
Maybe they have the Michelin
bomb that only destroys

1019
01:06:57,884 --> 01:06:59,719
restaurants under four stars.

1020
01:07:00,854 --> 01:07:04,391
They still test their bombs.
They still detonate their bombs.

1021
01:07:04,524 --> 01:07:06,092
Where did they do
the undeground test?

1022
01:07:06,226 --> 01:07:07,761
In the Sahara,
in the total wasteland?

1023
01:07:07,794 --> 01:07:12,265
No, fuck off!
In Tahiti! In paradise.

1024
01:07:12,532 --> 01:07:15,735
Why?
"Because we're French".

1025
01:07:15,935 --> 01:07:17,904
"Oh, look a Green Peace
boat's come to protest".

1026
01:07:18,071 --> 01:07:19,773
"Fuck off, I sink you".

1027
01:07:20,173 --> 01:07:22,575
"I'm the baddest mother
fucker, am I not"?

1028
01:07:22,776 --> 01:07:25,445
"Look, I'm giving a
cigarette to a baby".

1029
01:07:26,913 --> 01:07:31,985
"Suck on the cigarette.
Life is shit. Get to know this".

1030
01:07:32,519 --> 01:07:35,555
"You, Americans.
Fuck all of you Americans"!

1031
01:07:38,158 --> 01:07:42,295
"Americans, you politically correct.
You cultureless crack Americans".

1032
01:07:42,529 --> 01:07:44,431
"We hate all of you.
Fuck off"!

1033
01:07:44,464 --> 01:07:48,735
"The Germans are here...
Hello, Americans"!

1034
01:07:49,636 --> 01:07:55,008
"I love you!
Come on, Americans".

1035
01:07:56,476 --> 01:07:59,279
"Welcome back, Americans"!

1036
01:07:59,646 --> 01:08:01,681
"You can build a Disneyland
near Paris".

1037
01:08:03,016 --> 01:08:05,552
"We won't go, but build it".

1038
01:08:05,785 --> 01:08:09,356
"It will have a Minnie mouse with
armpit hair. It will be great"!

1039
01:08:10,023 --> 01:08:13,827
Smoking a Galloise, going
"I never loved Mickey".

1040
01:08:14,527 --> 01:08:18,665
"He has three fingers. What am I,
a bowling ball? Fuck off"!

1041
01:08:19,532 --> 01:08:20,600
"Don't love him"!

1042
01:08:25,872 --> 01:08:29,109
But there is one country
that watches out for all of us

1043
01:08:29,242 --> 01:08:32,979
the Swiss, ya!
The Geneva Convention.

1044
01:08:33,113 --> 01:08:35,648
If there's ever a nuclear war,
they will be the only people going

1045
01:08:35,782 --> 01:08:37,550
"What was that noise"?

1046
01:08:38,518 --> 01:08:40,220
In their big hollowed out country,

1047
01:08:40,353 --> 01:08:42,522
with their chocholate
and their watches. Ya!

1048
01:08:43,123 --> 01:08:45,392
The nice Germans. Ya!

1049
01:08:46,026 --> 01:08:48,828
Or, as they like to say,
"the other white race".

1050
01:08:49,963 --> 01:08:51,831
I have only one question.

1051
01:08:51,965 --> 01:08:57,637
How can you trust an army, that
has a wine opener on it's knife?

1052
01:08:59,005 --> 01:09:02,676
"Many of you, men, have never
opened Chardonnay under fire".

1053
01:09:06,012 --> 01:09:10,717
"You take out the wine bottle,
pull out the cock and throw"!

1054
01:09:10,917 --> 01:09:14,587
"I don't know, but I've been told,
Chardonnay must be self-cold".

1055
01:09:15,655 --> 01:09:20,427
My God! Where did all this
Impresionistic art come from?

1056
01:09:21,027 --> 01:09:24,197
And all these jewelry
from 1939 to 1945?

1057
01:09:25,065 --> 01:09:27,834
Fairies must've brought
it during the night.

1058
01:09:28,334 --> 01:09:32,238
I have to do the Heimlich and
cough up an account number.

1059
01:09:33,406 --> 01:09:34,941
I know this one thing...

1060
01:09:35,075 --> 01:09:39,479
I know there's one country that is not
developing a weapon of destruction.

1061
01:09:39,512 --> 01:09:42,816
That does not have a secret
weapon's lab up in the mountains.

1062
01:09:42,949 --> 01:09:44,617
Jamaica!

1063
01:09:47,754 --> 01:09:49,923
Jamaica would never make
an atomic bomb.

1064
01:09:50,523 --> 01:09:53,426
They may make
an atomic bong.

1065
01:09:53,927 --> 01:09:57,430
But I'd rather fight the war with an atomic bong
cause, when the atomic bomb goes off,

1066
01:09:57,564 --> 01:10:00,266
there's devastation and radiation.

1067
01:10:00,333 --> 01:10:04,571
When the atomic bong goes off,
there's celebration!

1068
01:10:09,409 --> 01:10:11,378
Smokes a split for the communion.

1069
01:10:11,511 --> 01:10:13,279
If you don't see Jesus then,
you never will.

1070
01:10:16,349 --> 01:10:19,085
I know only one thing.

1071
01:10:19,219 --> 01:10:22,155
I never met me
an angry pot smoker.

1072
01:10:22,389 --> 01:10:28,128
I never met a man who said
"Hey, you fucking prick"!

1073
01:10:42,008 --> 01:10:46,046
"Oh, fuck"!

1074
01:10:46,179 --> 01:10:47,514
"What was I gonna do"!?

1075
01:10:49,215 --> 01:10:51,584
"Hold me, you piece of shit.
Get over here"!

1076
01:10:51,785 --> 01:10:56,056
Because you see,
marihuana...

1077
01:10:59,492 --> 01:11:02,162
I know this one.
Wait a minute.

1078
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:12,005
If you smoke a lot of pot, you may
never become a rocket scientist.

1079
01:11:12,138 --> 01:11:14,441
Or maybe...

1080
01:11:15,375 --> 01:11:18,812
If you seen some of the things that
happened recently to NASA, maybe you can.

1081
01:11:22,082 --> 01:11:23,717
"The Mars lander..."

1082
01:11:25,352 --> 01:11:28,121
"I did the calculations in feet,"

1083
01:11:28,421 --> 01:11:31,524
"but I programmed
the lander in meters".

1084
01:11:34,928 --> 01:11:38,064
"So, instead of landing,
fucker burried"!

1085
01:11:38,732 --> 01:11:41,801
"185 million dollars... oopsy"!

1086
01:11:41,968 --> 01:11:44,037
"Two years... splat"!

1087
01:11:44,237 --> 01:11:47,107
"OK, fuck!
Here's a better one"!

1088
01:11:49,109 --> 01:11:51,411
"The Hubble Telescope..."

1089
01:11:51,611 --> 01:11:54,948
"I forgot to put in a lens".

1090
01:11:55,548 --> 01:11:58,718
Read the top line.
"Officer Jerry, serial..."

1091
01:11:58,852 --> 01:12:01,154
"The rest is just a black hole".

1092
01:12:01,855 --> 01:12:05,358
I once called Steven Hawking's house,
"Hello, this is Steven Hawking".

1093
01:12:05,692 --> 01:12:08,995
- Yes, I'd like to leave a message.
- No, this is Steven Hawking.

1094
01:12:11,331 --> 01:12:12,599
I know one thing though.

1095
01:12:13,233 --> 01:12:16,903
Pot is not like alcohol.
Alcohol changes your moods.

1096
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:21,174
Go to a bar at happy hour and see
some happy motherfuckers there.

1097
01:12:22,175 --> 01:12:24,944
See those guys going,
"Hey, fuck you, my man"!

1098
01:12:26,713 --> 01:12:28,448
"Hey, listen to me".

1099
01:12:29,916 --> 01:12:33,086
"Listen to me, you piece of shit".

1100
01:12:33,853 --> 01:12:38,091
"You do not know shit
about fuck, my man".

1101
01:12:41,695 --> 01:12:44,264
"You want a piece of yourself"?

1102
01:12:45,065 --> 01:12:48,201
"Step outside, I'll kick my ass".

1103
01:12:48,435 --> 01:12:50,770
"I've already shit myself,
I'm halfway there".

1104
01:12:54,107 --> 01:12:57,410
Some people know,
you can deal with it geneticaly.

1105
01:12:57,444 --> 01:12:59,112
If you're Irish, you've
got a running start

1106
01:12:59,245 --> 01:13:00,647
that you can do it
better than we are.

1107
01:13:01,448 --> 01:13:06,653
If you're Irish, you'll kick my ass
but then you'll sing about it, afterwards.

1108
01:13:07,087 --> 01:13:09,255
"Oh, the night you
said my wife was fat,"


1109
01:13:09,389 --> 01:13:10,990
"I knocked you down
and shit in your hat".

1110
01:13:15,895 --> 01:13:19,833
And then you keep drinking 'til you're
in your 80s and you're on a dialysis machine,

1111
01:13:19,866 --> 01:13:23,370
doing liver dancing
Michael Flatline.

1112
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:26,506
And they say the Irish
saved civilization,

1113
01:13:26,573 --> 01:13:27,907
drank a couple of Guiness

1114
01:13:28,041 --> 01:13:30,577
and forgot where they fucking put it.
But that's all right!

1115
01:13:30,643 --> 01:13:35,548
The Japanese drink
differently than us.

1116
01:13:36,416 --> 01:13:38,451
You could be polite during the day

1117
01:13:38,585 --> 01:13:40,854
and all of a sudden you're
"Arigato gozaimas".

1118
01:13:41,187 --> 01:13:45,825
And after five Jack Daniels...
"Tie the yellow ribbon"!

1119
01:13:49,496 --> 01:13:52,832
Karaoke for
"asshole with a microphone".

1120
01:13:53,366 --> 01:13:55,869
"Sing, you round eyed fuck, come on"!

1121
01:13:57,370 --> 01:14:02,976
And If you want a linguistic adventure,
go drinkin' with a Scotsman.

1122
01:14:03,009 --> 01:14:06,413
Cause you can't fucking
understand them before...

1123
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,550
You land in Scotland
and they're going

1124
01:14:11,551 --> 01:14:14,354
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah?

1125
01:14:19,693 --> 01:14:22,228
- Sure.
- Oh, fuck sure, eh?

1126
01:14:27,267 --> 01:14:30,804
- Sure!
- Oh sure, you dumb fucking bastard.

1127
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:37,844
And you realize how drunk they get,
they could wear a skirt and not care!

1128
01:14:38,611 --> 01:14:41,348
And how they could invent
a sport like golf.

1129
01:14:42,515 --> 01:14:45,352
Here's my idea for a fucking sport.

1130
01:14:45,852 --> 01:14:48,788
I knock a ball in a gopher hole.

1131
01:14:49,522 --> 01:14:52,292
- Oh, you mean like pool?
- Fuck off pool!

1132
01:14:52,325 --> 01:14:55,495
Not with a straight stick,
with a little fucked up stick!

1133
01:14:56,496 --> 01:14:59,366
I whack the ball, it goes
in a gopher hole.

1134
01:15:00,066 --> 01:15:03,303
- Oh, you mean like croquet?
- Fuck croquet!

1135
01:15:04,003 --> 01:15:07,173
I put the hole hundreds
of yards away!

1136
01:15:08,408 --> 01:15:12,479
Oh, fuck yeah!
There's big fun there!

1137
01:15:15,615 --> 01:15:18,251
- Oh, like a bowling thing?
- Fuck no!

1138
01:15:18,718 --> 01:15:20,954
Not straight,
I put shit in the way!

1139
01:15:21,855 --> 01:15:24,958
Like trees and bushes and high grass.

1140
01:15:25,191 --> 01:15:27,360
So you can lose you fucking ball.

1141
01:15:27,394 --> 01:15:30,463
And go hacking away
with a fucking tire iron!

1142
01:15:30,530 --> 01:15:34,534
Whacking away, and each time you miss
you feel like you're gonna have a stroke!

1143
01:15:35,201 --> 01:15:37,804
Fuck that's what we'll
call it, a stroke,

1144
01:15:37,971 --> 01:15:41,474
cause each time you miss you
feel like you're gonna fucking die!

1145
01:15:42,308 --> 01:15:45,712
Oh great, oh and here's the
better part. Fuck, this is brilliant!

1146
01:15:45,945 --> 01:15:48,715
Right near the end,
I'll put a little flat piece

1147
01:15:48,882 --> 01:15:51,284
with a little flag to
give you fucking hope.

1148
01:15:52,385 --> 01:15:55,755
But then I'll put a
pool and a sandbox,

1149
01:15:55,922 --> 01:15:58,091
to fuck with your ball again!

1150
01:15:58,358 --> 01:16:03,196
You'll be there trashing your ass,
jerking away in the sand.

1151
01:16:03,463 --> 01:16:07,434
- And you do this one time?
- Fuck no!

1152
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:12,305
Eighteen fucking times!

1153
01:16:20,814 --> 01:16:23,316
There you have a sport!

1154
01:16:23,883 --> 01:16:25,151
The manly sport of golf,

1155
01:16:25,285 --> 01:16:27,921
where you can dress like a
pimp and no one will care.

1156
01:16:28,288 --> 01:16:33,626
Where even a blind gay man would go,
"Oh, dear Christ"!

1157
01:16:34,094 --> 01:16:37,797
"Those are loud, this is not carnival!
What the fuck are you on"?

1158
01:16:38,264 --> 01:16:41,167
Even the aligator's going,
"Asshole"!

1159
01:16:42,836 --> 01:16:47,574
It's such an athletic sport,
whack the ball, get in the car.

1160
01:16:48,575 --> 01:16:51,111
Whack the ball,
get in the car.

1161
01:16:51,411 --> 01:16:53,480
And the commentary's electrifying.

1162
01:16:53,947 --> 01:16:56,850
Just this side of Curling,
for really getting me going.

1163
01:16:56,983 --> 01:16:59,252
"We're on the third green now".

1164
01:17:00,954 --> 01:17:04,224
"Could people be quieter,
I'd like to hear the grass grow".

1165
01:17:05,925 --> 01:17:09,763
I want the guy who does Mexican
soccer to do golf one time.

1166
01:17:11,398 --> 01:17:14,134
"The ball is rolling,
the ball is going to the..."

1167
01:17:14,267 --> 01:17:21,975
"Hole"!

1168
01:17:25,278 --> 01:17:27,414
Just to see all those
waspy motherfuckers going,

1169
01:17:27,547 --> 01:17:29,416
"Oh, dear Christ"!

1170
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:33,853
"My God, they're not gardening,
they're playing now, oh, shit"!

1171
01:17:34,254 --> 01:17:37,957
"What the hell are we gonna do"?
That was their last domain of dominance.

1172
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:39,993
It was their area.
They were the king.

1173
01:17:40,126 --> 01:17:43,129
Up until... Tiger!

1174
01:17:46,666 --> 01:17:49,369
Son of a black man
and a Thai woman.

1175
01:17:49,402 --> 01:17:52,472
Not even a German geneticist
could've thought than one up!

1176
01:17:53,306 --> 01:17:57,510
Black athletic ability,
Buddhist concentration.

1177
01:18:01,214 --> 01:18:03,516
Crouching Potter.

1178
01:18:04,084 --> 01:18:06,486
And then he goes
to the British Open,

1179
01:18:06,619 --> 01:18:10,623
and he plays at Saint Andrews,
where they fucking invented the sport.

1180
01:18:10,690 --> 01:18:13,393
And after the forth round,
he's 18 under par.

1181
01:18:13,426 --> 01:18:16,296
And there's only 18 fucking holes.

1182
01:18:16,663 --> 01:18:20,934
And all the old men are going,
"My God, we're doomed"!

1183
01:18:21,101 --> 01:18:24,504
"How did he learn to play?
We wouldn't let him join, dear God"!

1184
01:18:24,904 --> 01:18:27,209
And they start having nightmares
of golf carts going...

1185
01:18:31,478 --> 01:18:33,480
"Yo, yo, yo, I'm playing through,"

1186
01:18:33,613 --> 01:18:35,648
"Whether you're a gentile or a Jew."

1187
01:18:35,715 --> 01:18:38,985
"Purple beats, motherfucker"!

1188
01:18:45,959 --> 01:18:50,063
All of your gentle sports are no longer
gentle. Tennis used to be...

1189
01:18:53,333 --> 01:18:54,669
Until the Williams sisters...

1190
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:03,943
- 40, love?
- No, that's good love, baby!

1191
01:19:06,079 --> 01:19:08,214
Even boxing's changed.

1192
01:19:08,281 --> 01:19:11,851
Remember boxing, people go, "I go
to boxing to watch the sport of boxing".

1193
01:19:11,885 --> 01:19:13,953
Like saying,
"I go to stock car races"

1194
01:19:14,087 --> 01:19:16,823
"to see people take
left turns all day".

1195
01:19:17,223 --> 01:19:21,161
No, you go to boxing to see
someone get the fuck beat out of him.

1196
01:19:21,361 --> 01:19:24,998
Even the guy who loses is going,
"I have 18 million dollars".

1197
01:19:25,398 --> 01:19:27,333
"I don't know where it fucking is..."

1198
01:19:28,735 --> 01:19:33,873
"I'm gonna buy me a big ass house,
but I can't find it. Fuck off"!

1199
01:19:34,974 --> 01:19:38,978
Boxing was the same.
And then Mike Tyson!

1200
01:19:39,846 --> 01:19:42,415
Mike Tyson comes along
and bites somebody.

1201
01:19:43,283 --> 01:19:45,985
Let's get ready to nibble!

1202
01:19:46,853 --> 01:19:49,189
All these guys're going,
"Oh, dear God, he bit somebody"!

1203
01:19:49,389 --> 01:19:51,057
I'm saying, "You're lucky
he just bit somebody".

1204
01:19:51,191 --> 01:19:54,361
"Mike just got out of prison.
You're lucky he didn't fuck him".

1205
01:19:55,762 --> 01:19:59,232
You bite somebody in jail its like,
"Get ready bitch, you're mine now"!

1206
01:19:59,532 --> 01:20:01,334
- Break it up!
- We're not finished.

1207
01:20:01,368 --> 01:20:04,237
Mike said to a journalist, "I'm gonna
fuck you, till you love me".

1208
01:20:04,371 --> 01:20:07,440
At that point I'm going, "Someone
didn't come here to box, babe".

1209
01:20:08,375 --> 01:20:12,412
Mike said, "I'm on Zoloft, so I
don't kill you, motherfuckers"!

1210
01:20:12,846 --> 01:20:15,515
I'm going,
"Up the dosage, Mike"!

1211
01:20:16,783 --> 01:20:19,853
There's all these drugs,
Zoloft, Prozac.

1212
01:20:19,986 --> 01:20:22,188
I wanna have one drug
encompassing it all.

1213
01:20:22,455 --> 01:20:24,791
Call it "Fuck It All".

1214
01:20:25,525 --> 01:20:29,629
I don't feel anything, I don't
wanna do anything, "Fuck It All".

1215
01:20:30,563 --> 01:20:33,967
The closest thing to a coma
you'll ever be, "Fuck It All".

1216
01:20:34,401 --> 01:20:37,670
I'm sitting here in my own dong,
"Fuck It All".

1217
01:20:38,605 --> 01:20:41,641
The scary thing about drugs is that
they have some horrible side effect.

1218
01:20:41,875 --> 01:20:43,743
"May cause artificial insemination".

1219
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,615
What?
What do you mean?

1220
01:20:49,315 --> 01:20:52,552
There's a product called Olestra,
which is a very strange thing.

1221
01:20:52,585 --> 01:20:54,054
Olestra? What is that?

1222
01:20:54,187 --> 01:20:57,590
It said on the little side of the chips,
"May cause anal leakage".

1223
01:21:00,727 --> 01:21:03,930
That's not a side effect
if my ass is going...

1224
01:21:05,398 --> 01:21:08,334
I think that's an effect, really!

1225
01:21:09,269 --> 01:21:13,106
"Fire in the hole"!
Bad day!

1226
01:21:14,274 --> 01:21:18,345
- How you're doing, Bob?
- Just a little anal leakage, Ted.

1227
01:21:18,945 --> 01:21:21,948
Bob, you wanna get out
of the pool right now?

1228
01:21:26,252 --> 01:21:30,690
I want science to help me.
God, look at me! Look at this!

1229
01:21:30,824 --> 01:21:33,793
I had women in NY saying
"Don't wear fur"!

1230
01:21:34,928 --> 01:21:39,032
The politically correct... red paint
"Fuck off, lady, it's me"!

1231
01:21:39,332 --> 01:21:41,801
I'm a fucking Chia pet.

1232
01:21:42,402 --> 01:21:45,705
I've gone to the zoo
and had monkeys go...

1233
01:21:52,112 --> 01:21:53,980
Anybody who thinks the
zoo is a happy place,

1234
01:21:54,114 --> 01:21:57,150
go and watch the monkeys wait
for groups of school children.

1235
01:21:57,283 --> 01:22:01,054
Watch the fun.
The monkeys sit there, like...

1236
01:22:01,454 --> 01:22:03,423
"Wait for it".

1237
01:22:05,492 --> 01:22:08,294
"Wait 'til the teacher comes
with the video camera".

1238
01:22:09,963 --> 01:22:10,298
"Now"!

1239
01:22:21,474 --> 01:22:23,176
Cause they're not happy.

1240
01:22:23,343 --> 01:22:25,945
Even the poor animals
like Ling Ling the panda,

1241
01:22:26,079 --> 01:22:28,548
she must mate, so you can
build the wing on the zoo.

1242
01:22:28,748 --> 01:22:31,217
They go to China,
they anesthesize a panda,

1243
01:22:31,351 --> 01:22:32,519
which is kinda redundant...

1244
01:22:34,254 --> 01:22:37,490
They bring him back to America
and give him a name like Ping Pong.

1245
01:22:38,191 --> 01:22:40,593
When his Chinese name was
Who Shu Ko Hu,

1246
01:22:40,827 --> 01:22:42,495
"Bear with Balls of Steel".

1247
01:22:43,396 --> 01:22:46,266
They put him in the cage with
Ling Ling, saying "Go, mate"!

1248
01:22:46,366 --> 01:22:50,103
He looks at her like,
"I would never fuck her"!

1249
01:22:52,505 --> 01:22:55,975
"That is one ugly panda bitch".

1250
01:22:56,543 --> 01:23:00,613
"If you were a panda, you'd know that's
the fucking ugliest panda bitch there is".

1251
01:23:01,414 --> 01:23:04,317
"I wouldn't have fucked her
with a koala's dick"!

1252
01:23:05,585 --> 01:23:06,886
"Fuck off"!

1253
01:23:07,454 --> 01:23:11,024
"I would rather lick my own balls,
than fuck that panda bitch"!

1254
01:23:13,326 --> 01:23:16,629
There's only one animal
who can tell you

1255
01:23:16,763 --> 01:23:18,531
if she's happy
and wants to mate.

1256
01:23:18,932 --> 01:23:21,267
That is Coco,
the silverback gorilla.

1257
01:23:21,334 --> 01:23:24,104
She saw me,
the blue eyed simian.

1258
01:23:25,038 --> 01:23:26,573
She was intrigued.

1259
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:29,376
She said to her trainer...

1260
01:23:29,409 --> 01:23:31,611
- What does that mean?
- She wants you to tickle her.

1261
01:23:31,644 --> 01:23:32,479
OK, I tickle her...

1262
01:23:34,147 --> 01:23:36,316
Then she goes...

1263
01:23:36,349 --> 01:23:38,952
- What does that mean?
- She wants you to lift your shirt.

1264
01:23:40,453 --> 01:23:44,824
I lift my shirt, she reaches out
and grabs both my nipples.

1265
01:23:45,759 --> 01:23:48,995
And when an 800 pound
gorilla's got you by the tits...

1266
01:23:49,496 --> 01:23:51,464
you listen!

1267
01:23:51,664 --> 01:23:55,335
Then my balls went,
"Somebody wants to play".

1268
01:23:56,536 --> 01:23:59,305
- Should we go to phase two?
- No! Do not go to phase two!

1269
01:24:01,908 --> 01:24:05,945
"I repeat!
Do not go to lift off"!

1270
01:24:06,546 --> 01:24:09,449
"This may feel like a human, but
notice the placement of the tumbs".

1271
01:24:09,582 --> 01:24:11,317
"This is not a human"!

1272
01:24:11,985 --> 01:24:13,787
"Do not go to phase two"!

1273
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,922
"Warning! Warning"!

1274
01:24:16,456 --> 01:24:18,825
She must've sense something,
cause she grabes me by the hand,

1275
01:24:18,958 --> 01:24:21,528
takes me in the back.
Daktari meets Deliverance.

1276
01:24:21,895 --> 01:24:25,231
I'm expecting the crocodile
hunter to walk out and go,

1277
01:24:25,365 --> 01:24:30,270
"Oh, cranky! She wants
to fuck his brains out"!

1278
01:24:31,171 --> 01:24:34,974
"Watch out, boys and girls.
Danger! Danger! Danger"!

1279
01:24:35,608 --> 01:24:40,814
"This could be like that time I
put my finger in a crock's cloette".

1280
01:24:42,015 --> 01:24:45,785
But part of me went,
"Could be fun"!

1281
01:24:47,587 --> 01:24:49,923
Make a great story for a bar.

1282
01:24:50,623 --> 01:24:53,226
A guy's going "I had
a wild night in Vegas".

1283
01:24:53,727 --> 01:24:56,296
"Yeah? Well I banged a gorilla".

1284
01:24:58,465 --> 01:24:59,799
"Where's everybody going"?

1285
01:25:02,602 --> 01:25:07,374
And you don't want that
late night phone call, "Hello"?

1286
01:25:08,842 --> 01:25:11,211
"Don't call me"!

1287
01:25:12,912 --> 01:25:14,881
Maybe it's because I'm 50.

1288
01:25:15,015 --> 01:25:18,184
When you hit 50, the old machinery
doesn't work so well.

1289
01:25:18,251 --> 01:25:22,389
You be at a public rest room going,
"How're you doing? Great game today, huh"?

1290
01:25:46,246 --> 01:25:49,015
"Oh, boy"!

1291
01:25:49,182 --> 01:25:53,720
What's happened is your prostate
is bigger than your ego now.

1292
01:25:54,054 --> 01:25:58,091
When you're in your 40s, you go to
the doctor they have to do the old...

1293
01:25:59,092 --> 01:26:00,226
First time is "Oh, my God"!

1294
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:02,696
"I'm just putting on the
glove, Mr. Williams".

1295
01:26:03,263 --> 01:26:05,732
I went back the second time and
I moaned another doctor's name.

1296
01:26:05,865 --> 01:26:06,866
Don't do that!

1297
01:26:09,436 --> 01:26:13,106
- Who's Dr. Smith?
- You're the only one!

1298
01:26:13,773 --> 01:26:15,875
When a woman has to
go to the gynecologist,

1299
01:26:16,009 --> 01:26:18,244
you don't want a doctor
who has a hobby.

1300
01:26:18,745 --> 01:26:21,348
You don't want a gynecologist
who's also a magician.

1301
01:26:22,549 --> 01:26:26,386
You don't want somebody going,
"How are we today... Oh, a dove"!

1302
01:26:27,754 --> 01:26:29,789
"Wow, what's this"?!

1303
01:26:33,026 --> 01:26:35,295
"Is this your card"?

1304
01:26:35,462 --> 01:26:40,467
I don't want a doctor who's a
proctologist and ventriloquist. No!

1305
01:26:41,267 --> 01:26:42,569
"How you're doing today"?

1306
01:26:42,702 --> 01:26:45,472
"Take your hand out of my ass.
I'm not a muppet. Move it"!

1307
01:26:46,673 --> 01:26:52,312
In your 50s it's no longer the...
It's the ortho-proctoscope.

1308
01:26:52,345 --> 01:26:54,280
The colonoscopy.
That's what W. did.

1309
01:26:54,647 --> 01:26:57,384
It's a video camera
on the end of a rodeo rudder.

1310
01:26:58,585 --> 01:27:00,920
And it's going up you!

1311
01:27:01,354 --> 01:27:04,124
Suddenly, you're your own
Discovery channel special.

1312
01:27:05,125 --> 01:27:08,361
"Slowly, we're going up
Robin's colon".

1313
01:27:08,995 --> 01:27:10,864
"This must be what you see".

1314
01:27:11,131 --> 01:27:15,935
"Slowly up ahead,
a burger he had in '85".

1315
01:27:16,202 --> 01:27:20,173
- Is that a polyp?
- That's a fart, Mr. Williams.

1316
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:22,709
They go further up your ass,
they blow air.

1317
01:27:23,510 --> 01:27:26,046
Now you're a fucking party favour.

1318
01:27:28,415 --> 01:27:33,553
Oh, doctor, give me all you can take!
I'm a man. Give me 120 psi!

1319
01:27:34,721 --> 01:27:36,222
You feel like a Pinata,
you think little Mexican kids

1320
01:27:36,356 --> 01:27:39,025
are gonna come out and go,
"Get the presents"!

1321
01:27:39,693 --> 01:27:43,630
The air is coming this way.
The farts are going, "Incoming"!

1322
01:27:44,264 --> 01:27:47,233
"It's not a... No finger!
It's the midget!

1323
01:27:47,267 --> 01:27:50,370
"Fall back behind the shit,
wait for my command"!

1324
01:27:51,304 --> 01:27:54,307
"Prepare to make
the wet sloppy noise"!

1325
01:27:54,004 --> 01:27:59,307
Because the moment they pull that
tube out of your ass, you are an evinrude!

1326
01:28:03,583 --> 01:28:07,854
"Rolling, rolling, rolling
Keep that colon flowing"!

1327
01:28:10,623 --> 01:28:13,593
Fourty miles, blowing outta you!

1328
01:28:16,863 --> 01:28:21,167
You put on your pants and you're floating
like a balloon spinning on the America's Cup.

1329
01:28:21,968 --> 01:28:24,070
"Coming about, Jimmy.
She's your"!

1330
01:28:25,505 --> 01:28:28,041
And then you realize...
"Oh, shit, fire in the hole"!

1331
01:28:29,209 --> 01:28:32,078
"Tighten up boys, we're not
gonna drop here"!

1332
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:34,147
"Thank you, doctor.
See you next week".

1333
01:28:38,585 --> 01:28:40,253
"Hold the elevator"!

1334
01:28:41,154 --> 01:28:42,856
"Fuck you, you bastard"!

1335
01:28:48,695 --> 01:28:49,829
Seven flights of stairs.

1336
01:28:51,164 --> 01:28:53,933
Everybody you pass,
you're going "It's me"!

1337
01:28:54,667 --> 01:28:57,570
Dogs look at you like
"Roll over, man, you're dead"!

1338
01:28:58,271 --> 01:29:01,107
You just wanna borrow a match.
"Give me that"!

1339
01:29:01,975 --> 01:29:03,343
Flaming asshole.

1340
01:29:03,943 --> 01:29:08,748
That's what you are. You're
a flaming asshole! You're 50!

1341
01:29:09,683 --> 01:29:12,085
And can they make a drug
to help you through all of that,

1342
01:29:12,252 --> 01:29:14,654
to keep all of your organs intact
'til your golden years? No!

1343
01:29:15,889 --> 01:29:17,524
Can they make a drug to give you

1344
01:29:17,657 --> 01:29:20,293
mental clarity to your
golden time? No!

1345
01:29:21,394 --> 01:29:24,964
They've got a drug to make you
harder than Chinese algebra!

1346
01:29:26,599 --> 01:29:29,269
Grandpa can have wood again.

1347
01:29:32,972 --> 01:29:35,008
- I don't need the walker!
- I see that!

1348
01:29:36,276 --> 01:29:37,410
And your grandmother's going

1349
01:29:37,544 --> 01:29:39,846
"Shit! I thought the war was over"!

1350
01:29:40,714 --> 01:29:44,384
"Get me a tetanus shot, if you gonna
stick me with that rusty thing"!

1351
01:29:51,358 --> 01:29:55,795
People have died on Viagra.
They have to have the open coffin...

1352
01:29:56,663 --> 01:30:00,567
"Oh, dear God, I don't
remember Pete being like that".

1353
01:30:01,067 --> 01:30:03,069
"Kids, go get some horse shoes".

1354
01:30:04,371 --> 01:30:06,306
"He would've wanted it that way".

1355
01:30:06,906 --> 01:30:11,478
You used to get that from some
strange Chinese aphrodisiac.

1356
01:30:11,511 --> 01:30:14,314
Like humming bird
eyelash and rhino horn.

1357
01:30:14,881 --> 01:30:16,950
To give you great masculinity.

1358
01:30:17,484 --> 01:30:22,856
But now you're on Viagra.
You are back! You are Frankencock!

1359
01:30:23,189 --> 01:30:26,159
You are "the Inseminator"!

1360
01:30:26,326 --> 01:30:28,228
You are ready to go!

1361
01:30:28,361 --> 01:30:33,633
You're gonna be going for one
hour, one hour and a half!

1362
01:30:34,134 --> 01:30:37,670
Guys are going "Yeah"!
Women are going "Uh-uh".

1363
01:30:38,705 --> 01:30:41,775
Cause after the first hour,
your wife's going

1364
01:30:41,808 --> 01:30:45,812
"Yay, oh, big daddy..."

1365
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:49,616
"Listen, I got shit to do, OK"?

1366
01:30:55,255 --> 01:30:56,356
"Hello"?

1367
01:30:57,791 --> 01:31:01,494
"Yeah, I'll be late today.
Viagra, fucking..."

1368
01:31:03,029 --> 01:31:07,434
"I'll try and get there.
Go outside with that thing"!

1369
01:31:08,268 --> 01:31:09,436
You can't go outside with a hard-on

1370
01:31:09,569 --> 01:31:12,172
cause the cat just
waits for you to go...

1371
01:31:13,273 --> 01:31:15,775
And your dog is going,
"Wow, you too"?!

1372
01:31:15,875 --> 01:31:16,876
Can't go to work like

1373
01:31:16,910 --> 01:31:19,479
- Hey, Bob!
- How're you, Pete?

1374
01:31:19,512 --> 01:31:21,648
"I'm happy to be here today"!

1375
01:31:22,082 --> 01:31:24,317
Direct traffic,
no, you can't do shit!

1376
01:31:24,751 --> 01:31:26,286
You have to make it
go away. You slap it.

1377
01:31:26,419 --> 01:31:29,122
It's like one of those
punch-me clowns.

1378
01:31:31,424 --> 01:31:35,028
"I'm not going anywhere"!

1379
01:31:35,195 --> 01:31:38,365
You have to finish it off.

1380
01:31:38,398 --> 01:31:40,233
In the old days was...

1381
01:31:41,401 --> 01:31:43,470
Now, after an hour and a half,

1382
01:31:43,603 --> 01:31:45,438
you've got more semen
than the Fifth Fleet.

1383
01:31:45,805 --> 01:31:49,009
So, when you go, it's like...

1384
01:31:49,776 --> 01:31:50,844
Oh, my eyes!

1385
01:31:50,977 --> 01:31:54,514
And your wife goes, "Now you
know how it feels, asshole"!

1386
01:31:57,751 --> 01:32:00,153
"Aim for the tits, Hawk Eye"!

1387
01:32:00,854 --> 01:32:03,623
"I'm like a Lawn Boy!
Get out"!

1388
01:32:03,790 --> 01:32:04,958
"Save yourselves"!

1389
01:32:05,291 --> 01:32:08,595
- Not the drapes!
- Too late... I own them now.

1390
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:15,402
You run out of semen and
your testicles are going

1391
01:32:15,535 --> 01:32:17,637
"We still got an erection, chief"!

1392
01:32:18,238 --> 01:32:20,807
"Give me blood, give me urine,
any fluid"!

1393
01:32:25,011 --> 01:32:29,449
"Oh, God, please make
this fucking shit go away"!

1394
01:32:31,484 --> 01:32:34,554
You do every goofy,
fucking orgasmic thing...

1395
01:32:54,307 --> 01:32:55,975
"Don't touch it"!

1396
01:33:02,716 --> 01:33:05,785
"Don't look at it"!

1397
01:33:05,919 --> 01:33:07,854
"Don't even think about it"!

1398
01:33:09,222 --> 01:33:12,325
And then you realize that God,

1399
01:33:12,459 --> 01:33:14,894
gave you a penis and a brain.

1400
01:33:15,061 --> 01:33:19,399
And only enough blood
to run one at a time.

1401
01:33:24,437 --> 01:33:27,173
You have lost thoughts
from your childhood.

1402
01:33:30,844 --> 01:33:33,046
And then you hear these
words from your lady...

1403
01:33:33,179 --> 01:33:35,415
"My turn"!

1404
01:33:38,385 --> 01:33:40,987
"You can't fucking be serious"!

1405
01:33:43,023 --> 01:33:45,392
"Look at me, I'm Goo Boy!
What are you doing"?

1406
01:33:47,427 --> 01:33:49,696
"That's right, Corky!
It's time to saddle up".

1407
01:33:49,829 --> 01:33:51,664
"We're heading South of the border".

1408
01:33:52,532 --> 01:33:54,167
"You gotta please Missy".

1409
01:33:55,235 --> 01:33:56,803
I have one question for the ladies...

1410
01:33:57,604 --> 01:33:59,272
Do we look like this?

1411
01:34:53,593 --> 01:34:55,695
"Are you almost there"?

1412
01:34:56,429 --> 01:34:59,232
"No, no, no.
I will finish"!

1413
01:34:59,933 --> 01:35:02,235
"I love you"!

1414
01:35:03,236 --> 01:35:07,007
"I love you!
I will finish".

1415
01:35:08,174 --> 01:35:13,346
"I can take it.
I just can't feel my tongue".

1416
01:35:13,947 --> 01:35:15,548
"Who's your daddy"?

1417
01:35:16,516 --> 01:35:18,885
"I love you"!

1418
01:35:19,352 --> 01:35:21,454
"I will finish".

1419
01:35:34,467 --> 01:35:36,536
Good night!

1420
01:36:11,871 --> 01:36:13,973
Thank you!

1421
01:36:19,145 --> 01:36:20,347
Thank you!

1422
01:36:21,815 --> 01:36:22,749
This night for New York!

1423
01:36:25,418 --> 01:36:27,887
What are we gonna do tonight, Marty?

1424
01:36:28,855 --> 01:36:30,290
Good night!

1425
01:36:34,861 --> 01:36:36,596
You're the best!

1426
01:36:38,765 --> 01:36:39,966
We did it!

1427
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:48,074
My pink lady...

1428
01:37:09,826 --> 01:37:15,454
