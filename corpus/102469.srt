00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,306
Back when there was eight of us.

174
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,725
(airplane passing overhead)

175
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:37,312
We're going to the mall.

176
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:44,027
Shit.

177
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:15,851
Damn.

178
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,729
(woman screams)

179
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,856
Hurry up!

180
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:23,984
back up.

181
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:33,619
(snarling)

182
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:35,537
Open the door.

183
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,460
(banging)

184
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:44,254
(banging, snarling continues outside)

185
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,347
Lights.

186
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,098
Here.

187
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:02,397
(static on line)

188
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:04,566
- No?
- No.

189
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:48,944
(# muzak version of don't worry, be happy)

190
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:56,136
Come on.

191
00:18:57,221 --> 00:18:59,181
Sit right there.

192
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,363
(gun cocking)

193
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:19,785
We need to make sure this place is safe.
I'll see if the doors this way are locked.

194
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,829
I'll check down there.

195
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:25,332
Maybe, officer, you could go check...

196
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:30,671
all right. Ok.

197
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:33,715
Maybe it's better you stay here with the gun.

198
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:36,510
Andre and I will check around.

199
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,097
Baby, i'll be right back.

200
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,517
No, just stay right here. Stay right here.

201
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,637
(rattling)

202
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:05,849
(rattling)

203
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:19,071
Shatterproof, asshole.

204
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,617
Shit.

205
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:51,645
(distant clunking, man grunting)

206
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:17,254
(grunting)

207
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:25,846
(snarls)

208
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:34,980
(distant crashing and snarling)

209
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:43,155
(distant yelling)

210
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:47,117
(snarling roar)

211
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:49,411
(screaming)

212
00:23:01,173 --> 00:23:03,467
(snarling)

213
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:15,062
(hissing snarl)

214
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:31,829
- What happened?
- Come on, move.

215
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:34,998
Move!

216
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:38,627
- which way?
- Here. Elevators.

217
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,214
Let's go, let's go!

218
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,970
(lift dings)

219
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:01,483
Can I see that arm?

220
00:24:01,567 --> 00:24:03,652
I need to suture that.

221
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,114
- Are you ok?
- Yeah.

222
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:17,958
- Find someplace else.
- We just need a place...

223
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:22,087
- maybe you didn't hear me.
- There is no place else.

224
00:24:22,171 --> 00:24:25,924
Tough shit. This is our place
and you can't stay here.

225
00:24:26,008 --> 00:24:28,927
Yeah. And you already trashed metropolis.

226
00:24:29,011 --> 00:24:32,431
- My wife is pregnant. We can't run.
- (bell dings)

227
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:35,976
- His arm...
- those things are down there.

228
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:38,770
These are your problems, not mine.

229
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:41,523
If I put my foot up your ass,
would that be your problem?

230
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:45,861
Hey, asshole, i'm the one
pointing the gun at you.

231
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:47,654
He is a cop, cj.

232
00:24:47,738 --> 00:24:51,158
- (bell dings)
- So what?

233
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:54,244
(ana) we're not gonna cause any trouble.

234
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:58,040
Just let us stay here
for a little while. Please.

235
00:25:03,754 --> 00:25:08,008
Ok. Come out slowly
and give your weapons to bart and terry.

236
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:10,177
- Don't do it.
- You must be crazy.

237
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,514
You can take your ass on over
to quality inn, shaq.

238
00:25:13,597 --> 00:25:16,892
Huh? You want to do that?

239
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:20,145
Let's go.

240
00:25:20,229 --> 00:25:22,564
Hey, don't give him that gun.

241
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,947
Fuck.

242
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,828
Smart move.

243
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:40,541
(reporter) 'nobody knows what's going on.
There's a lot of blood and bodies.

244
00:25:40,624 --> 00:25:44,753
'There's a slew of fires.
We're going back to a live picture now.'

245
00:25:44,837 --> 00:25:47,714
(news reports overlapping)

246
00:25:52,261 --> 00:25:55,097
'One second. Ma'am, are you american? '

247
00:26:00,978 --> 00:26:03,939
All right. Let's go, guys.

248
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:08,193
Come on. Get your own little tv.
Come on. Let's go.

249
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,241
(russian accent) excuse me.
Please. Is there a restroom?

250
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:16,577
No. You're staying here.

251
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,581
Then tell us where in here you'd like us to piss.

252
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,128
It's around the corner, that way.

253
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:28,755
Whoa, where are you going?

254
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:31,133
She's not going anywhere alone.

255
00:26:31,216 --> 00:26:35,929
"She's not going anywhere..." this is a
fucking nursery school! go with them.

256
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:39,099
'I'm bill vibert for 23-v cable news.

He's still bleeding. I need to stitch his arm.

- You a fucking doctor?
- No, i'm a fucking nurse.

- 'I know some of these people.'
- First aid kit's in the off! Ce.

america always sorts its shit out.

271
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:42,371
You're lucky. He could have bitten it off.

(sobs)

279
00:28:42,848 --> 00:28:44,933
What's the holdup, darling?

280
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:49,730
Hm?

281
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:52,691
(shouting on tv)

282
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:55,861
So what's the plan?

283
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:59,239
The plan is you drink a tall glass
of shut-the-fuck-up.

284
00:28:59,323 --> 00:29:02,451
- (sirens on tv)
- Ok. That's one idea.

285
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:07,789
What about locking this place down?
Sooner or later, they'll get in.

286
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:12,419
That's good. I hadn't thought of that.

287
00:29:12,503 --> 00:29:17,549
No doubt. You probably already thought
about putting a sign up on the roof

288
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:20,928
cos there's still planes in the air.

289
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:24,515
Might be good to let them know we're alive.

290
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:40,489
We can get paint from case hardware.
Use doors to board up the weak spots.

291
00:29:40,572 --> 00:29:42,991
That's a solid plan.

292
00:29:43,075 --> 00:29:45,285
Cj, is it?

293
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:49,164
- Yeah.
- All right, cj.

294
00:29:56,296 --> 00:30:01,426
(clears throat) listen up. I'm giving
everybody a job and I expect you to do it.

295
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:04,346
I don't want to see any half-assin'.

296
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:08,016
You can start by cleaning up
that mess you made in metropolis.

297
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,646
Hey, cj, look!

298
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:14,314
terry.

299
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:16,316
Look at ben cozine.

301
00:30:19,444 --> 00:30:22,656
Hey, ben. Ben!

302
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:25,117
christ. Look at him.

303
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:28,620
(bart) look, he's a twitcher.

304
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:35,169
Tv says you gotta shoot 'em in the head.

305
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:37,337
Tv said a lot of things.

306
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:41,258
Fuck the fucker.
I told him not to go downstairs.

307
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:02,571
Let's go. Let's get to work.

308
00:31:04,615 --> 00:31:07,242
Holy shit.

309
00:31:10,621 --> 00:31:12,247
(growling)

310
00:31:12,331 --> 00:31:13,874
(snarls)

311
00:31:27,304 --> 00:31:32,309
(bart) let's do it.
(terry) all right, let's pick him up, then.

312
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:35,729
Ready? One, two, three.

313
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:37,731
On two. All right?

314
00:31:37,814 --> 00:31:40,526
One, two.

315
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:44,154
(snarling below)

316
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:45,906
What are they?

317
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:49,076
I don't know. Why are they coming here?

318
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:54,289
Memory, maybe. Instinct.
Maybe they're coming for us.

319
00:31:56,124 --> 00:31:58,168
(gunshots)

320
00:31:58,252 --> 00:32:00,420
- (snarling)
- (gunshot)

321
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:04,591
Look over there.
There's someone on the roof.

322
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:11,014
His name's andy. He's alone.

323
00:32:12,516 --> 00:32:14,893
He may as well be on the moon.

324
00:32:14,977 --> 00:32:17,020
(ana) poor guy.

325
00:32:19,815 --> 00:32:21,775
What's he pointing at?

326
00:32:21,859 --> 00:32:23,694
(engine overhead)

327
00:32:23,777 --> 00:32:26,822
- Helicopter.
- Hey, it's coming.

328
00:32:27,698 --> 00:32:32,035
- (cj) fuckin' a, man!
- (all shouting)

329
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:34,788
(ana) hey!
(michael) hey!

330
00:32:34,872 --> 00:32:37,749
- hey!
- where's he...?

331
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:40,919
Please... what's he doing? Where's he going?

332
00:32:45,716 --> 00:32:49,303
No. I mean, they saw us, so...

333
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:53,682
they'll be coming back, baby.
Don't worry. They'll send somebody.

334
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:58,228
(ana) it's safe here.
We'll just wait for them to come back.

335
00:33:16,455 --> 00:33:20,292
I don't want anybody
sneaking around and stealing shit.

336
00:33:22,544 --> 00:33:24,505
Comprende?

337
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:28,509
Sweet dreams.

338
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:36,892
Those assholes are gonna get us killed.

339
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:39,019
(sighs)

340
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:41,355
We have to do something.

341
00:33:41,438 --> 00:33:45,359
I'm not doing anything
to create problems for luda and me.

342
00:33:45,442 --> 00:33:48,821
- The helicopter's coming back soon.
- I hope so.

343
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:54,785
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It's means it might come and it might not.

344
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:58,121
What do you mean?
You said it was coming back!

345
00:33:58,205 --> 00:34:02,084

Hey, officer, how do you like
following a guy that sells tvs?

355
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:42,666
About as much as I like
following a guy who steals them.

00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:36,046
(distant snarling)

517
00:47:40,277 --> 00:47:44,323
- Hey. You need anything?
- No, we're fine.

518
00:47:44,406 --> 00:47:46,575
He's got a bite on his hand.

519
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:56,627
- She's cold.
- (wheezing)

520
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:59,421
That's good, right?

521
00:47:59,505 --> 00:48:02,049
I don't know. It's weird.

522
00:48:02,132 --> 00:48:05,052
An infection this bad
usually comes with a fever.

523
00:48:07,012 --> 00:48:10,724
That guy's arm looks pretty bad.
You should check it out.

524
00:48:10,807 --> 00:48:15,270
- (wheezing and moaning)
- All right. Stay with her for a minute.

525
00:48:19,483 --> 00:48:22,694
- Let me take a look at that.
- I'm fine, really.

526
00:48:22,778 --> 00:48:28,158
They don't hurt much. Tucker could use you
more than me. His ankle's cut pretty bad.

527
00:48:28,242 --> 00:48:30,661
I'll just clean it up a bit.

528
00:48:30,744 --> 00:48:32,996
- You ok?
- (wheezing gasp)

529
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:36,291
Ma'am, can I get you something?
Like a glass of water?

530
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:39,002
(wheezing gasps)

531
00:48:40,796 --> 00:48:43,090
Anal ana, come here!

532
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,367
anyone know her name?

533
00:49:13,537 --> 00:49:15,581
Died without a name?

534
00:49:16,582 --> 00:49:18,542
Damn.

535
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:21,128
You wanna use the other room?

536
00:49:25,966 --> 00:49:27,968
Holy shit!

537
00:49:31,555 --> 00:49:33,807
(shrieking roar)

538
00:49:36,685 --> 00:49:39,104
- (squelch)
- (grunts)

539
00:49:39,188 --> 00:49:41,857
(panting)

540
00:49:43,066 --> 00:49:44,902
Holy shit.

541
00:49:46,945 --> 00:49:48,989
Holy shit.

542
00:49:53,577 --> 00:49:56,038
I think it's the bites.

543
00:49:56,121 --> 00:50:00,417
Frank said she was walking on her own
five hours ago.

544
00:50:00,501 --> 00:50:03,712
The bites killed her.
The bites brought her back.

545
00:50:03,795 --> 00:50:05,214
How do you know?

546
00:50:05,297 --> 00:50:09,343
I watched it happen.
I felt her pulse, she was gone. Then...

547
00:50:09,968 --> 00:50:12,012
yesterday I saw the same thing.

548
00:50:14,431 --> 00:50:16,892
I think that's why it spread so fast.

549
00:50:19,728 --> 00:50:21,730
All right.

550
00:50:23,899 --> 00:50:26,360
So who else in the group is bitten?

551
00:50:26,443 --> 00:50:29,530
- Frank for sure.
- And the one with the foot?

552
00:50:29,613 --> 00:50:32,533
Tucker? He says no, he fell.

553
00:50:32,616 --> 00:50:35,118
So it's frank. Tall guy, right?

554
00:50:35,202 --> 00:50:38,205
Right. So we have to quarantine him.

555
00:50:38,288 --> 00:50:40,207
Where do we do that?

556
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:42,626
There must be a place in here.

557
00:50:42,709 --> 00:50:45,170
Then what?

558
00:50:45,254 --> 00:50:47,214
I don't know. But...

559
00:50:47,965 --> 00:50:50,467
it's too dangerous to keep him here.

560
00:50:54,221 --> 00:50:58,141
What are we talking about?
Are we talking about killing him?

561
00:50:58,225 --> 00:51:00,936
You'd rather wait for him to die
and then he kills us?

562
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:04,314
Yes. No. You can't kill him.
He's got a daughter!

563
00:51:04,398 --> 00:51:06,525
i'm sorry.

564
00:51:07,317 --> 00:51:09,486
There's no other choice.

565
00:51:12,114 --> 00:51:14,074
He's right.

566
00:51:16,326 --> 00:51:18,245
Michael, no. What if i'm wrong?

567
00:51:18,328 --> 00:51:20,664
You've seen it happen before.

568
00:51:24,418 --> 00:51:26,295
Frank.

569
00:51:26,378 --> 00:51:28,422
Michael's coming to shoot you.

570
00:51:29,423 --> 00:51:32,759
- What?
- You're infected.

571
00:51:32,843 --> 00:51:35,637
You're going to become one of them.

572
00:51:36,889 --> 00:51:39,433
(frank) is this true?

573
00:51:39,516 --> 00:51:42,102
Are you here to kill me?

574
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:46,106
- You were bitten. It's only a matter of time.
- No. No. No.

575
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:50,110
Leave my dad alone. Go away.
You can't do this.

576
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:55,407
You have to understand
that she's lost everyone.

577
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:59,578
Her mother, her two brothers.

578
00:52:01,538 --> 00:52:03,832
I'm all she's got.

579
00:52:07,044 --> 00:52:10,214
Well, michael, what are you waiting for?

580
00:52:10,297 --> 00:52:13,175
- Go ahead. Kill him.
- (daughter sobbing)

581
00:52:14,551 --> 00:52:18,347
- Hey, kill tucker, too.
- Wait a minute. I was never bit.

582
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:21,308
We can't be sure. Do it, michael.

583
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,146
Are you sure it's the bite?

584
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:28,649
No.

585
00:52:28,732 --> 00:52:31,193
She's sure.

586
00:52:36,073 --> 00:52:38,116
I'm sorry.

587
00:53:05,602 --> 00:53:08,313
- Hey.
- Hi.

588
00:53:08,397 --> 00:53:10,732
- Are you ok?
- Mm.

589
00:53:10,816 --> 00:53:13,026
Let me see your arm.

590
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:14,820
It hurts.

591
00:53:14,903 --> 00:53:17,072
It's already starting to heal.

592
00:53:17,156 --> 00:53:20,117
Andre, I can't have baby here.

593
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,954
Why not? People have had babies
for millions of years,

594
00:53:24,037 --> 00:53:26,790
all on their own, no hospitals.

595
00:53:26,874 --> 00:53:29,751
- Wait.
- Oh, yeah.

596
00:53:29,835 --> 00:53:31,962
- It's moving.
- I felt it.

597
00:53:32,045 --> 00:53:34,423
We gotta come up with a name.

598
00:53:34,506 --> 00:53:37,801
- I want russian name.
- Don't start that. African name.

599
00:53:37,885 --> 00:53:41,471
- Please?
- Come here and give me a hug.

600
00:53:47,811 --> 00:53:50,022
(frank) sweetie.

601
00:53:51,106 --> 00:53:53,484
I'm so proud.

602
00:53:57,404 --> 00:54:00,657
I couldn't ask for anything more in a daughter.

603
00:54:10,334 --> 00:54:12,377
(frank) I love you.

604
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,924
I love you too.

605
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,682
- Time to go, honey.
- No.

606
00:54:25,766 --> 00:54:28,227
(whimpering)

607
00:54:29,812 --> 00:54:32,314
(sniffs)

608
00:55:10,310 --> 00:55:12,729
Terry, come on. Open the door.

609
00:55:12,813 --> 00:55:17,568
- Shut up.
- Don't tell me to shut up. Open the door.

610
00:55:17,651 --> 00:55:19,945
(bart) I got you this job. Come on.

611
00:55:36,587 --> 00:55:38,672
(hoarse whisper) you want...

612
00:55:40,632 --> 00:55:42,384
every...

613
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:47,264
single second.

614
00:56:14,333 --> 00:56:16,460
Ana.

615
00:56:18,754 --> 00:56:21,298
I'm glad you didn't do it.

616
00:56:26,428 --> 00:56:28,472

617
00:56:30,224 --> 00:56:31,808

00:58:30,594 --> 00:58:32,638
(mutters)

648
00:58:32,721 --> 00:58:34,681
I'm gonna skip to the top three.

649
00:58:34,765 --> 00:58:38,143
Number three. "he listens to me."

650
00:58:38,227 --> 00:58:41,355
Number two. "he tells me he loves me."

651
00:58:41,438 --> 00:58:43,690
And number one.

652
00:58:46,235 --> 00:58:48,779
It's trust. Number one is trust.

653
00:58:49,863 --> 00:58:52,491
(snarling)

654
00:58:52,574 --> 00:58:54,076
(gunshot)

655
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:56,453
(laughing) holy shit.

656
00:58:57,496 --> 00:58:59,998
He got him.

657
00:59:04,837 --> 00:59:07,840
- So, who do we have next?
- Er...

658
00:59:10,884 --> 00:59:13,428
yeah. Burt reynolds.

659
00:59:13,512 --> 00:59:16,098
Tell him to get burt reynolds.

660
00:59:16,181 --> 00:59:18,475
(laughs)

661
00:59:32,865 --> 00:59:35,951
- (steve) my goodness.
- Man, he's good.

662
00:59:36,034 --> 00:59:38,620
It barely even looked like him.

663
00:59:38,704 --> 00:59:41,456
Oh, oh... er...

664
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:44,793
- rosie o'donnell. Tell him rosie.
- Yeah, rosie.

665
00:59:44,877 --> 00:59:47,629
Nah, too easy. Give him something hard.

666
00:59:47,713 --> 00:59:51,133
You guys had rough childhoods?
A little bit rocky?

667
00:59:51,216 --> 00:59:56,013
Hey, sweetheart, let me tell you something.

668
00:59:56,096 --> 01:00:00,309
You have my permission -
if I ever turn into one of those things,

669
01:00:00,392 --> 01:00:02,478
blow my fucking head off.

670
01:00:02,561 --> 01:00:05,230
Oh, yeah, you can count on that.

671
01:00:10,068 --> 01:00:15,240
I guess the first time
I knew I was gay I was 13.

672
01:00:16,742 --> 01:00:19,328
This guy,

673
01:00:19,411 --> 01:00:21,413
todd,

674
01:00:22,956 --> 01:00:25,209
he was building a deck in our backyard...

675
01:00:25,292 --> 01:00:28,462
oki just, please, stop.

676
01:00:32,466 --> 01:00:34,760
He had the most astonishing blue eyes.

677
01:00:34,843 --> 01:00:37,346
Oh, my god! i'm in hell.

678
01:00:37,429 --> 01:00:39,640
(groans in frustration)

679
01:00:45,646 --> 01:00:47,356
How's luda doing?

680
01:00:47,439 --> 01:00:51,401
She's fine. Hey, where's that lemon stuff?

681
01:00:51,485 --> 01:00:54,905
It's all gone. Steve likes to put it in his booze.

682
01:00:56,657 --> 01:00:58,659
Try the vanilla stuff.

683
01:00:58,742 --> 01:01:00,661
All right.

684
01:01:00,744 --> 01:01:03,997
I'd like to check on her, see how she's doing.

685
01:01:04,081 --> 01:01:05,541
No, thanks. She's fine.

686
01:01:05,624 --> 01:01:09,211
- You sure?
- Yeah, i'm sure.

687
01:01:09,294 --> 01:01:11,547
It's ok, hon. We understand.

688
01:01:11,630 --> 01:01:13,632
(meows)

689
01:01:17,845 --> 01:01:20,013
Thanks.

690
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:26,854
(snarling below)

691
01:01:36,488 --> 01:01:39,700
And before that, I worked in a stationery store.

692
01:01:39,783 --> 01:01:43,745
And I drove a snowplow. Fixed copiers.

693
01:01:43,829 --> 01:01:48,250
It's a shame this whole
end-of-the-world thing's holding you back.

694
01:01:48,333 --> 01:01:50,794
(laughter)

695
01:01:53,338 --> 01:01:55,007
Ok, worst job.

696
01:01:59,553 --> 01:02:04,057
I know which job I was the worst at -
it was being a husband.

697
01:02:04,141 --> 01:02:07,019
- That's not a job.
- It sure is.

698
01:02:07,853 --> 01:02:10,856
You guys just haven't met the right girl.

699
01:02:10,939 --> 01:02:13,609
I tried it three times and...

700
01:02:13,692 --> 01:02:16,320
I got pink slips every time.

701
01:02:17,196 --> 01:02:19,281
What were you best at?

702
01:02:24,369 --> 01:02:26,872
Being a dad.

703
01:02:29,166 --> 01:02:31,168
I think I was best at that.

704
01:02:39,218 --> 01:02:40,802
(all gasp and scream)

705
01:02:40,886 --> 01:02:42,304
(kenneth) calm down.

706
01:02:42,387 --> 01:02:44,973
(norma) are they in?
(michael) no. Are there generators?

707
01:02:45,057 --> 01:02:47,267
(wails)

708
01:02:50,521 --> 01:02:53,982
- (wails)
- Shh. Ok, shh.

709
01:02:54,066 --> 01:02:57,486
Shhh... it's all right, baby.

710
01:03:00,823 --> 01:03:03,367
(wails)

711
01:03:10,624 --> 01:03:13,377
(wails)

712
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:16,046
Baby, please. You got to be quiet, ok?

713
01:03:18,048 --> 01:03:22,678
It's gonna be all right.
Our baby is on the way. It's coming.

714
01:03:24,972 --> 01:03:27,141
That's it.

715
01:03:27,224 --> 01:03:32,938
It's in employee parking level 3.
They're in a pen near the parking shuttles.

716
01:03:33,021 --> 01:03:36,400
- Have fun.
- Wait a minute. You're coming too.

717
01:03:36,483 --> 01:03:41,071
No, i'm not. I said i'd tell you
where the generators are, not show you.

718
01:03:41,155 --> 01:03:45,826
Did you think i'd just leave you two up here?
You come with me or go back in the cell.

719
01:03:51,665 --> 01:03:53,792
All right.

720
01:03:53,876 --> 01:03:56,753
I ain't going anywhere without a gun.

721
01:03:58,005 --> 01:04:01,675
- You're not getting a gun.
- Trust.

722
01:04:01,758 --> 01:04:04,553
The primary ingredient in any relationship.

723
01:04:08,557 --> 01:04:10,684
Have at 'em, cowboy.

724
01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:14,271
Asshole.

725
01:04:16,398 --> 01:04:18,442
Bart, get the chains.

726
01:04:25,282 --> 01:04:27,826
(chains jangling, gun cocking)

727
01:04:28,911 --> 01:04:32,247
- You ready to roll?
- You're coming with us?

728
01:04:32,331 --> 01:04:34,541
No, you're coming with me.

729
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:36,752
I've done this before.

730
01:04:38,337 --> 01:04:40,339
Know how to use that?

731
01:04:41,548 --> 01:04:44,259
This one's the dangerous end, right?

732
01:04:46,136 --> 01:04:48,847
- (clicks)
- Now it is.

733
01:04:53,101 --> 01:04:55,312
(faint squeaking)

734
01:05:13,539 --> 01:05:16,416
This is level 1. we gotta walk down to 3.

735
01:05:32,975 --> 01:05:35,310

739
01:06:10,095 --> 01:06:13,432
What the fuck was that? I just saw something.

740
01:06:13,515 --> 01:06:15,726
You didn't see shit. Shut the fuck up.

741
01:06:15,809 --> 01:06:18,020

01:06:28,113 --> 01:06:29,823
Oh, shit. Here it comes.

746
01:06:40,959 --> 01:06:43,545
It's a fucking dog.

747
01:06:43,629 --> 01:06:46,423
- Come here, boy. (claps)
- (whimpers)

748
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:51,220
Nothing's here or it would've eaten him.

749
01:06:51,303 --> 01:06:54,389
- See? I told you I saw something.
- (barking)

750
01:06:54,473 --> 01:06:57,893
- What's wrong, boy?
- There's nothing wrong.

751
01:06:57,976 --> 01:07:00,270
That dog's just fucked up.

I'm gonna go check on luda.

779
01:10:59,301 --> 01:11:00,844

780
01:11:00,928 --> 01:11:03,555
- Yeah. I'll take them some candles.
- Ok.

01:11:03,639 --> 01:11:07,142
- Let me know if they need anything.
- I'll have a smoke on the way.

(chokes) the son of a bitch shot me.

01:13:49,805 --> 01:13:52,850
- Get away from her.
- Wait. Just wait.

801
01:13:55,811 --> 01:13:57,604
She died of the gunshot.

802
01:13:58,939 --> 01:14:00,983
She wasn't bitten.

803
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:03,861
But she'll wake up, right?

804
01:14:06,155 --> 01:14:08,991
No.

805
01:14:09,074 --> 01:14:11,952
No, if she was one of them,
she'd be up by now.

01:14:43,484 --> 01:14:45,903

- Yeah.

811
01:15:25,275 --> 01:15:28,195
- Somebody should say something.
- Yeah.

812
01:15:28,278 --> 01:15:30,072
Glen?

813
01:15:30,155 --> 01:15:32,282
No.

814
01:15:32,366 --> 01:15:34,952
You worked in the church.

815
01:15:36,119 --> 01:15:37,579
I played the organ.

816
01:15:37,663 --> 01:15:42,376
You must have heard the priest say
something about life and death.

817
01:15:42,459 --> 01:15:45,546
It was a job. I don't believe in god.

818
01:15:47,256 --> 01:15:49,341
I don't see how anyone could.

819
01:15:51,176 --> 01:15:53,387
Somebody should say something.

820
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:58,809
There's nothing to say.

821
01:15:59,977 --> 01:16:01,979
I've been to a lot of funerals.

822
01:16:03,355 --> 01:16:08,443
I've folded the flag and given it
to a lot of wives and fathers and kids

823
01:16:08,527 --> 01:16:10,654
and told them how sorry I was.

824
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:14,825
But that's not what I was really feeling.

825
01:16:14,908 --> 01:16:19,538
In the back of my mind,
I was always saying, "better them than me."

826
01:16:21,623 --> 01:16:24,084
But I don't believe that now.

827
01:16:24,168 --> 01:16:27,921
Now I realize there are some things
worse than death

828
01:16:28,005 --> 01:16:31,216
and one of them is sitting here waiting to die.

829
01:16:35,387 --> 01:16:37,473
I don't want to die here.

830
01:16:44,229 --> 01:16:46,815
I saw a couple of buses in the garage.

831
01:16:46,899 --> 01:16:50,360
We could reinforce them,
then get as far from here as possible.

832
01:16:50,444 --> 01:16:54,490
- And then what?
- I have an idea. Um...

833
01:16:54,573 --> 01:16:57,409
why don't we swing by the marina

834
01:16:57,493 --> 01:17:02,372
and hop in my boat and take it
for a pleasure cruise, you jackasses.

835
01:17:03,165 --> 01:17:07,669
Wait. There's islands in the lakes,
there's not a lot of people on them.

836
01:17:07,753 --> 01:17:09,671
I was kidding.

837
01:17:09,755 --> 01:17:12,424
- How far is the marina?
- Oh, my god!

838
01:17:13,717 --> 01:17:17,054
- you're serious?
- I think it's a damn good idea.

839
01:17:18,305 --> 01:17:20,849
How about the rest of you?

840
01:17:20,933 --> 01:17:24,019
- Kenneth?
- Yeah, it's a good idea.

841
01:17:24,102 --> 01:17:27,439
We have to pick up andy.
He's part of the group.

842
01:17:27,523 --> 01:17:32,861
Excuse me. Not to shit on anyone's riff
but let me see if I grasp this concept.

843
01:17:32,945 --> 01:17:37,866
You're saying we take the parking shuttles,
reinforce them with aluminum siding

844
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:39,827
and then head to the gun store

845
01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:44,206
where our friend andy plays some
cowboy-movie, jump-on-the-wagon bullshit.

846
01:17:44,289 --> 01:17:48,710
Then we drive across a ruined city
through thousands of dead cannibals,

847
01:17:48,794 --> 01:17:53,006
all so we can sail off into the sunset
on this fucking asshole's boat?

848
01:17:53,090 --> 01:17:56,593
And head for some island
which may not even exist?

849
01:17:57,636 --> 01:18:02,141
- Yeah.
- Pretty much, yeah.

850
01:18:05,602 --> 01:18:07,813
Yeah.

851
01:18:08,939 --> 01:18:11,483
Ok.

852
01:18:12,943 --> 01:18:14,319

01:19:27,226 --> 01:19:29,978
and 16 of the. 357 magnums.

867
01:19:30,062 --> 01:19:32,189
Yeah? That's still not very much,

868
01:19:32,272 --> 01:19:37,069
so hopefully there won't be
too many of them at the dock.

869
01:19:37,152 --> 01:19:39,321
Nice to see you busting your ass.

870
01:19:39,404 --> 01:19:42,991
Oh, that's sarcasm. That is awesome.

871
01:19:43,075 --> 01:19:46,620
You know, I would love to help but, er,

872
01:19:46,703 --> 01:19:49,832
a captain never works alongside his men.

873
01:19:49,915 --> 01:19:54,127
(lmitates whip cracking)
You guys have a good 'un.

874
01:19:54,211 --> 01:19:57,005
What a total dick.

875
01:19:57,089 --> 01:19:59,675
Guys, where did chips go?

876
01:19:59,758 --> 01:20:04,012
- Chips?
- I can't find him. Chips? Come on, chips!

877
01:20:04,096 --> 01:20:07,641
- (squeaks) "come on, chips!"
- where'd you go, honey?

878
01:20:07,724 --> 01:20:10,811
- (whistles)
- (barking)

879
01:20:10,894 --> 01:20:14,481
There you are. There's my boy.

880
01:20:14,565 --> 01:20:17,442
Don't you ever leave me again, ok?
Ever, ever.

881
01:20:45,012 --> 01:20:47,556
Hey. Kenneth wants a meeting upstairs.

882
01:20:47,639 --> 01:20:50,642
Come in here first. I want you to see this.

883
01:20:55,314 --> 01:20:59,276
When those things are on
the side of the bus, this'll get them off.

884
01:21:00,319 --> 01:21:02,279
Cool, huh?

885
01:21:02,905 --> 01:21:05,282
Wow.

886
01:21:05,365 --> 01:21:09,620
That might be the most romantic thing
anyone's ever shown me.

887
01:21:13,373 --> 01:21:15,334
I'm trying here.

888
01:21:16,668 --> 01:21:18,754
Yeah, I know.

889
01:21:34,102 --> 01:21:36,104
It's not just about him starving.

890
01:21:36,188 --> 01:21:40,901
If we pick him up and he doesn't have
his strength, we'll be carrying him.

891
01:21:40,984 --> 01:21:43,946
She's right. He's a hell of a shot. We need him.

892
01:21:44,029 --> 01:21:47,533
- I'm not saying we don't.
- There's no point in arguing.

893
01:21:47,616 --> 01:21:50,410
We need to get some food over there.

894
01:21:50,494 --> 01:21:55,123
I know. We draw straws and the loser runs
across the lot with a ham sandwich.

895
01:21:55,207 --> 01:21:58,794
- Could you be a bigger prick?
- Yes, but that's irrelevant.

896
01:21:58,877 --> 01:22:01,129
My question is, what's your plan?

897
01:22:01,213 --> 01:22:03,841
- Come on!
- (toy squeaks)

898
01:22:06,093 --> 01:22:08,220
- I got it.
- (all arguing)

899
01:22:08,303 --> 01:22:10,681
Shut up!
... more ammunition.

900
01:22:12,683 --> 01:22:14,518
I have an idea.

901
01:22:14,601 --> 01:22:18,689
- It's hurting him! it's not safe!
- they're not interested in him.

902
01:22:18,772 --> 01:22:22,860
They want us, ok? Chips is gonna be fine.

903
01:22:25,028 --> 01:22:26,864
(zombies snarling)

904
01:22:26,947 --> 01:22:29,658
(barking)

905
01:22:29,741 --> 01:22:31,577
(whistle)

906
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:35,956
See? Look, they're not even
paying attention to him.

907
01:22:38,542 --> 01:22:41,795
(kenneth) the walkie's in the bag?
(cj) yeah.

908
01:22:44,673 --> 01:22:47,176
Let me see. Let me see!

909
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:51,638
(andy blowing whistle)

910
01:22:51,722 --> 01:22:53,849
- There he is.
- (barking)

911
01:22:53,932 --> 01:22:56,059
Good boy. Good boy, chips.

912
01:22:58,395 --> 01:23:01,356
- Ok, he's there, he's in.
- Give me those.

913
01:23:03,609 --> 01:23:05,194
(kenneth) oh, man.

914
01:23:05,277 --> 01:23:07,362
- What? What?
- No.

915
01:23:07,446 --> 01:23:10,407
No. Oh, man. They got him. They got him!

916
01:23:11,450 --> 01:23:13,619
(gunfire)

917
01:23:18,832 --> 01:23:22,419
I'll try him on the radio.
Andy. Andy, do you copy?

918
01:23:23,795 --> 01:23:25,839
Andy, can you hear me?

919
01:23:26,965 --> 01:23:29,426
Andy?

920
01:23:29,510 --> 01:23:33,013
(andy) 'can you hear me? Hello?
This thing working?

921
01:23:33,096 --> 01:23:36,308
'I'm dinged up pretty bad but I think i'll be ok.'

922
01:23:37,476 --> 01:23:40,896
- Where are you hurt?
- 'Goddamn, those bastards bite hard.

923
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:46,610
'I just have to stop the bleeding.
It's really going. '

924
01:23:46,693 --> 01:23:51,031
- (chips barks)
- 'Easy, boy. Easy. Is this ken?

925
01:23:51,114 --> 01:23:53,200
'Is that you, man?'

926
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:58,413
- Yeah, it's me, brother.
- 'Hey, man, good to hear your voice.

927
01:23:58,497 --> 01:24:00,916
'I guess we'll meet up-close pretty soon.

928
01:24:00,999 --> 01:24:03,752
'Shit, hang on.

929
01:24:03,836 --> 01:24:06,255
'Ah, jesus. He got me good.'

930
01:24:06,338 --> 01:24:09,758
You just hang in there. You got the food, right?

931
01:24:09,842 --> 01:24:11,844
- 'Yeah.'
- Do we tell him?

932
01:24:11,927 --> 01:24:15,430

- 'Hey, this dog got a name?'

933

- See, nicole, chips... nicole?

934
01:24:21,186 --> 01:24:24,439
- What the hell's that?
- Oh, my god, it's nicole!

01:24:56,430 --> 01:25:00,934
'I don't know. There's a lot of blood in here.
There's blood everywhere. '

942
01:25:01,018 --> 01:25:03,187
Wait, I see him. He's on the roof.

943
01:25:04,396 --> 01:25:07,524
- He's writing something.

(nicole) 'guys?'

(buzzing and crackling)

957
01:25:49,399 --> 01:25:52,236
We need to do something. Now.

958
01:25:59,159 --> 01:26:01,995
Tucker, when we come back
we may have company.

959
01:26:02,079 --> 01:26:04,790
Stay here and make sure this door stays open.

960
01:26:04,873 --> 01:26:07,793
Wait, wait. I'm sorry. Why does he stay here

961
01:26:07,876 --> 01:26:12,548
while I go on the suicide mission
to rescue terry's already dead girlfriend?

962
01:26:12,631 --> 01:26:14,675
- Fuck you.
- We don't know that.

963
01:26:14,758 --> 01:26:18,887
Either way, we need the guns
to get out of this parking lot.

964
01:26:18,971 --> 01:26:22,975
- Michael, it's ok. Let him stay.

- All right. That's it.
- Are you sure?

969
01:27:15,819 --> 01:27:17,988
I'd say we're at the end of the line.
