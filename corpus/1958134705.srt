1
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,609
All aboard, girls!

2
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,745
Bye!

3
00:01:54,816 --> 00:01:57,351
- Welcome home, honey!
- Hi, Daddy!

4
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:58,218
Hi, Mom!

5
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,021
-Mom!
-Hi!

6
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:02,489
Hi!

7
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:05,727
Wait. Did you get taller?

8
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,327
-Yes, I did.
-Wow.

9
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:08,963
So good. Okay. Oh, here it is.

10
00:02:08,997 --> 00:02:10,364
- Let's get your trunk.
- Yes.

11
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:13,166
I double-parked the car
and they're already mad at me.

12
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,103
-What car?
-Oh, we bought a car.

13
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,537
-We bought got a car?
-Yeah!

14
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:18,305
-What for?
-I'll explain later.

15
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:19,540
It's that big blue one
right over there.

16
00:02:19,574 --> 00:02:20,908
In the middle of the road.

17
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:22,543
Hey, lady,
you kidding me?
Sorry!

18
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:23,911
-Sorry, we're going.
One second.
-There's my girl!

19
00:02:23,945 --> 00:02:25,445
Grandma!

20
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,381
Ah!

21
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:29,851
- Oh, God, I missed you!
- Me, too!

22
00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:31,552
Lady, you can't stop
in the middle of the street.
Let's go!

23
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:33,021
-I'm sorry. Promise,
two more seconds.
-Come on, lady.

24
00:02:33,054 --> 00:02:34,122
Welcome home gift.

25
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,823
-Oh, you made this?
-From scratch.

26
00:02:35,857 --> 00:02:37,025
-Aw!
-It's cashmere.

27
00:02:37,058 --> 00:02:38,092
I did everything

28
00:02:38,126 --> 00:02:39,493
but shave the goat.

29
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:41,062
- Margaret! Can you just...
- Let's go, ladies.

30
00:02:41,095 --> 00:02:43,363
I'm so sorry. Yeah,
get the bottom there.

31
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:45,566
-Okay. You got it.
-Here we go. Okay.

32
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,334
-Right on, girls.
-All right, here we go.

33
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,202
-Oh, God.
-Heavy.

34
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:50,470
Watch out for the...

35
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:53,007
-Watch out for the bike.
-Oh, God.

36
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,575
Here we go.

37
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:56,978
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.
I would've done it.

38
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:58,146
Oh, hi!

39
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,081
I would've done it.
Please, please.

40
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:02,249
-Oh, my God. Amazing.
-We got it.

41
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,619
-Dad!
-Hello! Oh, my goodness!

42
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:07,155
-I'm so glad to see you.
-Me, too!

43
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,488
Look at that! What happened?

44
00:03:08,523 --> 00:03:10,290
-So, how was camp?
-It was amazing.

45
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:11,358
-So, you were in a play?
-Yep!

46
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,360
Oh, my God. That's incredible.

47
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,929
-What are those boxes for?
-Don't worry about that.

48
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:15,997
I want to hear
more about camp.

49
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,131
What else did you learn?

50
00:03:17,165 --> 00:03:18,432
-What else did you do?
-You're moving.

51
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,536
-What?
-Really, Mom?

52
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,504
-Sylvia. You promised.
-Oh, wow.

53
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:24,972
We're moving?

54
00:03:25,006 --> 00:03:26,239
Look, it's...
Look, we we're...

55
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:27,642
She saw the boxes.

56
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:29,177
-She was putting it together.
-I don't think she was.

57
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,712
-We're moving?
-Okay.

58
00:03:30,745 --> 00:03:32,113
Just...

59
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:34,148
Look, we wanted you
to settle in

60
00:03:34,182 --> 00:03:35,650
before we sprung the news.

61
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:37,819
But, um, your dad
got his promotion.

62
00:03:37,852 --> 00:03:40,253
- Yeah. Isn't that great?
- And we found

63
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:41,321
- this great house.
- Oh, the best house.

64
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:42,690
-The best house.
-Where?

65
00:03:42,724 --> 00:03:45,392
Well, that's the thing.
We got really lucky. And...

66
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,662
- New Jersey.
- Ah...

67
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:51,264
-New Jersey?
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

68
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:53,233
I said I'd stay out of it.

69
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,969
We're leaving New York?

70
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:56,771
Barely leaving New York.

71
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:58,873
It's just on the other side
of the river.

72
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,273
But...

73
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,010
But we're happy here.
We don't need to move.

74
00:04:03,044 --> 00:04:05,713
No, we don't need to move
but we want to move. Right?

75
00:04:05,747 --> 00:04:06,781
I don't.

76
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:10,017
I'll have to leave
all of my friends

77
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:11,686
and change schools

78
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:14,021
and I'll never
see Grandma anymore.

79
00:04:14,055 --> 00:04:15,523
That is not true.

80
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:17,058
Look, you're going to keep
all your friends here

81
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:20,628
and you're going to make more
friends. And listen to this.

82
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:22,395
I'm not going to work anymore.

83
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:25,365
Do you know what that means?

84
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:28,035
That means that I'm not going
to be gone all the time.

85
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:30,505
Running from class to class.

86
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:33,775
God. Do you know how
bad I felt about that?

87
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:37,277
But you love teaching art.

88
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:42,482
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I do, I do, but...

89
00:04:42,517 --> 00:04:45,520
But this is,
this is our opportunity.

90
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:47,789
I'll be home now.

91
00:04:47,822 --> 00:04:51,592
I can be home with you
every single day.

92
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:53,293
I'll get involved
at your school,

93
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,096
just like
all your friends' moms.

94
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:58,766
And we'll have family dinners
and I'll learn to cook.

95
00:05:00,568 --> 00:05:01,969
I know it's a lot.

96
00:05:03,171 --> 00:05:04,939
Can you just
try to believe us?

97
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,043
Yeah.

98
00:05:11,012 --> 00:05:12,013
Mmm.

99
00:05:13,548 --> 00:05:15,650
I love you so much. Come here.

100
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:19,821
Come here. You, too.
And you, Sylvia.

101
00:05:19,854 --> 00:05:22,355
- Sylvia. Come on.
- Come on, Mom. Come on.

102
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,026
Come on.
You know you want to.

103
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:26,194
Faster.

104
00:05:26,227 --> 00:05:28,563
Okay, okay,
I'm coming, I'm coming.

105
00:05:28,596 --> 00:05:30,898
- There we go.
- Oh, my darling.

106
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:34,001
I'm never
going to see you again.

107
00:05:34,035 --> 00:05:35,435
Oh, Jesus.

108
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:38,539
-Wow.
-So dramatic all the time.

109
00:05:38,573 --> 00:05:39,807
What are you
taking her over there

110
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:41,341
with the schmucks
and the condos

111
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:42,610
on the other side
of the Hudson?

112
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:43,678
But we're not going to be
in a condo.

113
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:45,213
And those
mafia diners,

114
00:05:45,246 --> 00:05:46,379
where they shoot each other...

115
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:09,837
God...

116
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:23,651
God?

117
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:29,991
Are you there, God?

118
00:06:31,192 --> 00:06:35,696
It's me... Margaret Simon.

119
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:39,800
Um...

120
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,171
I just wanted... Well...

121
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,643
First, I've, I've heard a lot
of great things about you.

122
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,882
I don't want to move.

123
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,885
I've never lived anywhere
but the city, and...

124
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:01,222
I... I don't want to do this.

125
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:03,124
Please, I'm begging you.

126
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:06,060
Just please, just stop
this move from happening.

127
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:14,201
Um, if...
if you can't do that...

128
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:20,574
Just please don't let
New Jersey be too horrible.

129
00:07:52,106 --> 00:07:55,109
-You're gonna have
to hurry up, all right?
-Okay, Dad!

130
00:08:17,131 --> 00:08:19,967
Okay, you.
You need some light.

131
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,271
Oh, God.

132
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:26,741
They smell bad?

133
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:28,442
Oh, they don't
smell good, honey.

134
00:08:28,476 --> 00:08:32,380
- You're going to be there
very soon. Believe me.

135
00:08:32,413 --> 00:08:33,748
I'll get it.

136
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,518
I already know
your name's Margaret

137
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:38,753
and you're in sixth grade.

138
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:40,154
The real estate agent
sent out,

139
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,023
like, a tiny flyer about you
to the whole neighborhood.

140
00:08:42,056 --> 00:08:44,158
It was, like, this big
and it had your picture.

141
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:46,460
Oh, okay.

142
00:08:46,494 --> 00:08:48,629
I'm Nancy.
I'm in sixth grade, too.

143
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:49,764
Do you want to
come over to my house

144
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:51,465
and run under
the sprinklers with me?

145
00:08:51,499 --> 00:08:54,035
Oh. I don't know.

146
00:08:54,068 --> 00:08:55,569
You don't know?

147
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:59,440
Oh, no, no, no.
I just mean I'll have to ask.

148
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:01,275
Um, just a second.

149
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,944
-Mom?
-Yeah?

150
00:09:03,978 --> 00:09:05,346
There's a girl
from the neighborhood

151
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,448
who asked if I could go
under the sprinklers with her.

152
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:09,750
Oh, that's great. Yeah.

153
00:09:09,784 --> 00:09:11,385
I need my bathing suit.

154
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:12,686
Good luck finding it in here.

155
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,056
That's all right.
She can borrow one of mine.

156
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,192
Oh, hello.

157
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:21,195
Nancy Wheeler.
I live in the bigger house
up the street.

158
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,229
Come on, let's go.

159
00:09:28,636 --> 00:09:30,871
Whose class are you in
at Delano?

160
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:32,073
Um...

161
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:35,142
The letter said "Room 18."

162
00:09:35,176 --> 00:09:37,344
I'm in room 18, too!

163
00:09:37,378 --> 00:09:38,646
We were supposed to have
Miss Phipps,

164
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,681
but she ran off
with some guy to California,

165
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,183
so we're going to get
a new teacher now.

166
00:09:42,216 --> 00:09:44,351
Come on. Room's upstairs.

167
00:09:49,524 --> 00:09:50,724
Voila.

168
00:09:52,193 --> 00:09:53,360
My bathing suit's over here.

169
00:09:55,596 --> 00:09:57,398
Um...

170
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,800
-Here. It's clean.
-Thanks.

171
00:09:59,834 --> 00:10:02,603
-Where should I change?
-What's wrong with here?

172
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:07,341
Nothing. I don't mind
if you don't mind.

173
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:08,943
Why would I mind?

174
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,025
You're still flat.

175
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,595
Um...

176
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:29,163
Well, I'm already growing.
See?

177
00:10:30,164 --> 00:10:31,966
I'm going to have
a pretty big chest.

178
00:10:34,869 --> 00:10:36,170
You know,
coming from New York,

179
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:38,405
I thought you'd be
a lot more grown up.

180
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:39,740
Have you ever kissed a boy?

181
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:43,545
You mean, like, really kiss?
Like, on the lips?

182
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:45,646
Yeah. Have you?

183
00:10:46,247 --> 00:10:48,015
Not exactly.

184
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:51,051
Neither have I,
but I practice a lot.

185
00:10:51,085 --> 00:10:52,419
You want to see?

186
00:11:13,941 --> 00:11:14,975
What?

187
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:16,110
-Sorry.
-You have to practice

188
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:18,145
or else you won't
be a good kisser.

189
00:11:19,614 --> 00:11:21,048
Ready to go?

190
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:22,816
Sure.

191
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:26,086
Follow the leader.

192
00:11:27,622 --> 00:11:28,989
Yeah, watch me.

193
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:43,971
-I'm a supermodel.
-Okay.

194
00:11:48,943 --> 00:11:51,613
-Evan, you stupid idiot!
-I'm sorry.

195
00:11:51,646 --> 00:11:53,247
You're such a great model,
by the way.

196
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,315
Who are they?

197
00:11:54,348 --> 00:11:55,449
It's my dumb brother

198
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:56,483
-and his stupid friend.
-Hey.

199
00:11:56,518 --> 00:11:58,419
-Mom!
-That was uncalled for.

200
00:11:58,452 --> 00:11:59,453
Who are you?

201
00:12:00,622 --> 00:12:02,957
Margaret. Um, we moved in
down the street.

202
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,593
Oh, so you're the new people?

203
00:12:04,626 --> 00:12:06,026
Ask your dad if he wants me
to cut the lawn.

204
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,596
Five bucks, and I trim, too.

205
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:10,097
Evan!
Get over here right now!

206
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,299
- I got to go.
- Dude...

207
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,010
Got to get us more birdseed.

208
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:25,246
Yeah.

209
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,516
My name's Moose. Moose Freed.
I live down the street, too.

210
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,783
Um...

211
00:12:30,818 --> 00:12:31,986
Yeah, but don't forget
to ask your dad

212
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,821
about the lawn thingy.

213
00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:36,123
Yeah. I won't.

214
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:38,926
Oh,
now I got to go see Evan.

215
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:45,199
Sorry you got stuck
with Moose.

216
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:47,101
Oh, that's okay.

217
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:50,170
Anyways, listen, Margaret.

218
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:52,806
I've decided I want you
to join my secret club.

219
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,409
There's three of us
and I'm letting in one more.

220
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,578
But you can't wear socks

221
00:12:56,611 --> 00:12:58,078
or else the others
might not want you.

222
00:12:58,647 --> 00:12:59,880
Oh.

223
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:01,750
See you later.

224
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:07,888
<i>Are you there, God?</i>
<i>It's me, Margaret, again.</i>

225
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,962
It's the first day
of school tomorrow.

226
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:16,631
I met this girl, Nancy.

227
00:13:16,665 --> 00:13:18,932
I don't really know
if she liked me.

228
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:24,539
I think she just expected me
to be different or something.

229
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:29,943
Anyway, well,
it did get me thinking.

230
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:33,280
Maybe it is time for...

231
00:13:33,314 --> 00:13:37,318
things to be happening
around here?

232
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:40,120
Come in.

233
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:43,324
Look.

234
00:13:43,357 --> 00:13:44,858
<i>Anyway, just think</i>
<i>about what I mentioned.</i>

235
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:45,993
It was in
with the bathroom stuff.

236
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,595
I found this, too,
if you need it.

237
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:48,663
<i>Thanks, God.</i>

238
00:13:48,697 --> 00:13:50,497
-Thanks, Mom.
-Mmm-hmm.

239
00:13:52,734 --> 00:13:54,536
Oh, wow, look at you.

240
00:13:54,569 --> 00:13:57,505
Are you ready
for your first day?
How you feeling?

241
00:13:57,539 --> 00:13:59,139
It's going to be great, right?

242
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:02,777
And if it's not great, first
days don't count anyways.

243
00:14:02,811 --> 00:14:04,011
- Right?
- Exactly.

244
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:05,279
All right.
See you later.
- Bye!

245
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:08,282
Bye!
- Did I not
unpack your socks?

246
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:10,951
Oh, um, uh...

247
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:12,052
I don't want socks.

248
00:14:12,086 --> 00:14:14,221
Why? You'll get blisters.

249
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:15,557
I just don't.

250
00:14:16,457 --> 00:14:18,425
Okay.

251
00:14:19,761 --> 00:14:21,261
Oh. Oh, wait. Dad!

252
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:25,032
-Hey, hey, Dad!
-Yeah!

253
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:26,568
-Hey. Um...
-Hey.

254
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:29,103
I forgot to ask you.

255
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:30,772
Um, a boy named Moose asked

256
00:14:30,805 --> 00:14:32,940
if he can cut our lawn
for five bucks.

257
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:35,677
Moose? Well, tell him thanks,
but no, thanks.

258
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,977
I just got a new power mower

259
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,213
and I'm really excited
for the grass to grow.

260
00:14:40,615 --> 00:14:42,751
-All right. Knock 'em dead
today, all right, sweetie?
-Okay.

261
00:14:42,784 --> 00:14:44,485
-Okay.
-Bye.

262
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:48,455
I just need to warn you
one more time about the socks.

263
00:15:13,515 --> 00:15:14,649
Oh, Margaret's here.

264
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:23,625
Hello. Good,
I thought you'd forget.

265
00:15:23,658 --> 00:15:24,726
Guys, this is Margaret,

266
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,059
the one
I was telling you about.

267
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:28,228
-Margaret, this is Janie.
-Hi, nice to meet you.

268
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,264
-Yeah, you, too.
-And this is Gretchen.

269
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:33,133
-So, you're the fourth.
-Yeah.

270
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:35,202
Well, you're lucky
we saved you a seat.

271
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:38,071
Or else you'd be sitting
next to Norman Fisher.

272
00:15:40,642 --> 00:15:42,142
Ugh.

273
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:44,945
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, don't look.

274
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,282
Philip Leroy just walked in.

275
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:51,118
I was praying so hard
he'd be in our class.

276
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:52,554
Who's Philip Leroy?

277
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,622
Take a guess.

278
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,331
Is that our teacher?

279
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:08,035
Her? No.

280
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:11,004
That's Laura Danker.
Stay away from her, okay?

281
00:16:11,673 --> 00:16:12,907
My brother says that

282
00:16:12,941 --> 00:16:15,075
she goes behind the A&P
with him and Moose

283
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:17,545
and lets them feel her up.

284
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:26,286
Good morning, class.

285
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,856
First, let me
introduce myself.

286
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:30,257
I am Mr. Benedict.

287
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,993
And I'm your new
sixth grade teacher.

288
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:35,597
Please complete
the following sentences

289
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:39,066
so we can get to know each
other a little better, yeah?

290
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:42,737
Now, I'll begin, just to
start things off for you guys.

291
00:16:43,805 --> 00:16:45,105
I love that I'm finally

292
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,474
getting to be a teacher
for the first time.

293
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:50,344
I hate...

294
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:52,246
feeling self-conscious

295
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:53,548
trying not to feel
self-conscious because

296
00:16:53,581 --> 00:16:56,216
then you only feel
more self-conscious

297
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,351
and then you're blabbing
in front of

298
00:16:57,384 --> 00:16:58,620
a whole bunch of kids. Um...

299
00:16:58,653 --> 00:17:01,689
I'm looking forward to
the year with you all.

300
00:17:02,256 --> 00:17:04,291
Okay, uh, your turn.

301
00:17:14,268 --> 00:17:15,603
Pass it on.

302
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:30,484
Yes. Okay.

303
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:39,661
Can any of you go in here?

304
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,164
Ugh, no.

305
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:46,801
Back in the box.

306
00:18:00,915 --> 00:18:04,619
Okay. All right. Enough.

307
00:18:04,652 --> 00:18:06,453
Enough, enough, enough.

308
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:21,569
-Hello?
-Guess who?

309
00:18:21,603 --> 00:18:23,771
Oh. Sylvia, hi. Um...

310
00:18:24,706 --> 00:18:27,575
-Margaret's not home yet.
<i>-It's 3:32.</i>

311
00:18:27,942 --> 00:18:29,343
<i>Yeah?</i>

312
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:32,446
You said she's out at 3:15
and the walk is ten minutes.

313
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:34,515
Yes, I did say that.
But, well...

314
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:35,516
I'm sure she'll be

315
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,217
walking through that door
any minute now.

316
00:18:37,785 --> 00:18:39,020
Well...

317
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:41,823
Okay. I guess I'll just wait.

318
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:43,825
Okay.

319
00:18:46,928 --> 00:18:48,730
So, how are you?

320
00:18:48,763 --> 00:18:52,100
I am fine. I'm good. Yes.

321
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:54,267
-And how are you?
<i>-Oh, fine.</i>

322
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:56,604
I read that when you don't
have any loved ones around

323
00:18:56,638 --> 00:18:59,206
your life expectancy
drops drastically,

324
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,875
but, you know,
I've had a good run.

325
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:05,847
You have.
You really have. Um...

326
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,181
Margaret is here.
Just a second.

327
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:11,351
-It's Grandma.
-Oh. Where's the Band-Aids?

328
00:19:11,953 --> 00:19:13,420
Mmm.

329
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:15,188
-Grandma!
<i>-Honey!</i>

330
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:17,692
How's New Jersey?
Are you okay?

331
00:19:17,725 --> 00:19:19,393
You can tell me the truth.

332
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:20,928
You know,
it's actually not that bad.

333
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:25,967
Well, that's great news!
Wonderful news.

334
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,434
Anyway, I was thinking

335
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:30,404
that you could come visit
the weekend after next.

336
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:32,040
<i>I'll get tickets to a show.</i>

337
00:19:32,073 --> 00:19:33,407
You can stay overnight,

338
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,242
we'll have
a little slumber party.

339
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:36,678
That could be fun, right?

340
00:19:36,711 --> 00:19:38,079
Oh, I'd love that.

341
00:19:38,112 --> 00:19:40,414
Oh, I knew you would. Great.

342
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:42,315
And I'll tell your mother
it was your idea.

343
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,118
-Okay?
<i>-Okay.</i>

344
00:19:44,152 --> 00:19:47,088
-Bye. Bye.
<i>-Bye, sweetheart.</i>

345
00:19:47,121 --> 00:19:48,623
- Bye.
<i>- Love you.</i>

346
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,896
Hey, Mom, can I go Nancy's?

347
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:56,664
Right now?
But you just got home.

348
00:19:56,698 --> 00:19:58,198
I haven't even heard
about your day yet.

349
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:01,102
-I know, but can I go?
-Can I have one word?

350
00:20:01,135 --> 00:20:03,104
Ugh... Uh?

351
00:20:03,137 --> 00:20:04,204
Is that a word?

352
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:07,075
-Can I go? Bye.
-Yes, yes, okay, go.

353
00:20:07,108 --> 00:20:09,209
-I love you. Bye!
-Bye!

354
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:12,180
Freddy was like,
"Boom, boom, look at me!"

355
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:13,648
He's like,
"Make up your mind!"

356
00:20:13,681 --> 00:20:15,348
-She wants attention.
-Obviously.

357
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:17,317
I know.
With her "boobala joobeelee."

358
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,352
Hi!

359
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,288
We were talking about
Laura Danker again.

360
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:24,424
Yeah. And how she got
even bigger over the summer.

361
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,794
Yeah, she looked so grown up.

362
00:20:26,828 --> 00:20:28,730
You know she's worn
a bra since fourth grade?

363
00:20:28,763 --> 00:20:30,631
And I bet you a dollar
she gets her period, too.

364
00:20:30,665 --> 00:20:32,533
Well,
I know for sure
someone in the school does.

365
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:34,802
-How?
-I always check the bins.

366
00:20:34,836 --> 00:20:36,704
-You know those little bins
in the stall?
-Mmm.

367
00:20:36,738 --> 00:20:39,473
All right. Let's get down
to business, huh?

368
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:41,475
-First of all...
-Thanks.

369
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:43,578
...this secret club
is a secret.

370
00:20:43,611 --> 00:20:46,446
Nobody tells anybody
what happens here,

371
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,749
-all right?
-Duh.

372
00:20:47,782 --> 00:20:49,984
Second, if you want
to be in the club,

373
00:20:50,017 --> 00:20:51,886
then you have to
follow the rules.

374
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,286
What kind of rules?

375
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,023
Well, I don't know.
I'm thinking of them.

376
00:20:57,191 --> 00:20:59,560
Don't rush me. Hmm.

377
00:21:00,628 --> 00:21:01,896
Oh, I have one.

378
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:06,366
If you want to be in the club,
then you have to wear a bra.

379
00:21:07,902 --> 00:21:09,170
I have one.

380
00:21:09,203 --> 00:21:12,640
If you guys get your period,
you have to tell us about it.

381
00:21:12,673 --> 00:21:14,175
- Yes.
- Immediately.

382
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,676
Every detail.
Especially how it feels.

383
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,979
Mmm-hmm.
- Ooh, mine is,

384
00:21:18,012 --> 00:21:19,312
we can make a Boy Book

385
00:21:19,346 --> 00:21:21,015
and write down the names
of the boys that we like.

386
00:21:21,048 --> 00:21:23,416
Mmm-hmm!
What about you, Margaret?

387
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,919
What's your rule?

388
00:21:30,024 --> 00:21:31,291
Um...

389
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:35,663
Yeah, with the Boy Books,
we have to show them

390
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:39,934
to each other at every meeting
and we can't ever lie.

391
00:21:41,536 --> 00:21:43,470
All right.

392
00:21:43,504 --> 00:21:45,973
Let's get
this party rolling.

393
00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:48,441
Whoo!

394
00:22:25,847 --> 00:22:27,380
Okay, honey.

395
00:22:30,885 --> 00:22:32,753
All right. Mmm.

396
00:22:32,787 --> 00:22:33,821
See you tomorrow.

397
00:22:35,923 --> 00:22:37,124
I want to get a bra.

398
00:22:40,561 --> 00:22:41,662
Oh.

399
00:22:43,264 --> 00:22:44,966
You... You think you need one?

400
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,501
Oh, no. Oh, honey.

401
00:22:47,535 --> 00:22:51,404
I'm so sorry.
No, I just mean that, uh...

402
00:22:51,438 --> 00:22:52,740
Bras are kind of a pain,

403
00:22:52,773 --> 00:22:55,276
so you know, why start sooner

404
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:56,777
than you need to?

405
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:01,215
But if you want one,
we... we can get you one.

406
00:23:01,249 --> 00:23:02,449
Well, yeah.

407
00:23:03,084 --> 00:23:04,151
So you want one?

408
00:23:04,185 --> 00:23:05,253
Yes. I already said that.

409
00:23:05,286 --> 00:23:07,922
Right. Okay.

410
00:23:07,955 --> 00:23:12,159
Great. Well, all right.
Well, then, we will do that.

411
00:23:12,193 --> 00:23:15,162
-This week?
-Yes. Good night.

412
00:23:15,196 --> 00:23:19,667
Good night. Good night,
my sweet. Okay.

413
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,468
<i>So glad</i>
<i>that's over with, God.</i>

414
00:23:30,845 --> 00:23:32,613
I'm sorry.
Hold on, just a moment.

415
00:23:33,848 --> 00:23:35,482
Are you here
for the PTA meeting?

416
00:23:35,516 --> 00:23:38,853
Oh, yes. Hi, hi.
I'm Barbara Simon.

417
00:23:38,886 --> 00:23:42,590
Oh, Barbara! I'm Jan Wheeler.
Nancy's mother.

418
00:23:42,623 --> 00:23:44,926
-I met Margaret.
-Oh, oh.

419
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:46,727
We're just about to get
started, so please come in.

420
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:48,596
-Have a seat.
-Okay, thank you.

421
00:23:48,629 --> 00:23:49,864
-All right.
-Just anywhere is fine?

422
00:23:49,897 --> 00:23:51,431
-Here. Just right here.
-Okay, okay.

423
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:53,668
Here we go.

424
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,638
Thank you all for coming.

425
00:23:57,672 --> 00:24:00,374
Delano is nothing without
its dedicated parents.

426
00:24:00,408 --> 00:24:01,742
Let's dive right in
and get started

427
00:24:01,776 --> 00:24:03,443
the way we do every year,

428
00:24:03,476 --> 00:24:05,212
by forming our committees.

429
00:24:05,246 --> 00:24:08,382
First up,
we have the Campus
Improvement Committee.

430
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:09,449
Any volunteers?

431
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:11,218
Ooh. Okay.

432
00:24:11,252 --> 00:24:13,486
Oh. Wonderful.

433
00:24:13,521 --> 00:24:16,891
Uh-huh. Barbara,
I got you. Okay.

434
00:24:16,924 --> 00:24:20,493
Next, the Delano
Social Committee.

435
00:24:20,995 --> 00:24:21,829
Sure, yeah. Okay.

436
00:24:21,862 --> 00:24:25,366
- Okay.
- Great.

437
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:27,702
All right.
The Fundraising Committee.

438
00:24:30,171 --> 00:24:31,305
Good for you, Barbara.

439
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:32,673
This is going to be great.

440
00:24:32,707 --> 00:24:34,809
All right, pencils down.

441
00:24:34,842 --> 00:24:37,445
Kindly pass
your worksheets forward.

442
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:39,380
How'd you do, Margaret?

443
00:24:39,413 --> 00:24:40,448
I think
I did pretty good.

444
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,649
All right, uh...

445
00:24:41,682 --> 00:24:44,051
Before the bell,
I want to share some news

446
00:24:44,085 --> 00:24:46,754
that I think will make you all
very happy.

447
00:24:46,787 --> 00:24:49,757
Now that you all
are in the sixth grade,

448
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:53,861
you'll get to do a full,
year-long research project.

449
00:24:53,894 --> 00:24:55,896
Yes!

450
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,264
The worst.

451
00:24:59,533 --> 00:25:00,634
Margaret, I would like
to talk to you

452
00:25:00,668 --> 00:25:02,636
for a moment after class.

453
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,239
Uh-oh.
What'd you do, Margaret?

454
00:25:11,178 --> 00:25:13,180
-Hi.
-Please have a seat.

455
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:17,351
So basically,
I'm just having little chats

456
00:25:17,385 --> 00:25:20,021
with each student in advance
of your research projects

457
00:25:20,054 --> 00:25:21,155
to answer any questions

458
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:23,691
or perhaps guide you
toward a topic of choice.

459
00:25:24,358 --> 00:25:25,526
Oh.

460
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,962
And I read your
getting-to-know-you paper.

461
00:25:27,995 --> 00:25:29,997
And I noticed
under the "I hate" section,

462
00:25:30,031 --> 00:25:32,867
you wrote
"religious holidays."

463
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,936
Which I... I found curious.

464
00:25:38,939 --> 00:25:41,742
If you don't want to share,
you don't...

465
00:25:41,776 --> 00:25:43,110
You don't have to, Margaret.

466
00:25:43,144 --> 00:25:45,146
Oh, no. It's just, um...

467
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:47,081
I guess I just
don't like those holidays

468
00:25:47,114 --> 00:25:49,316
because I don't
celebrate any of them.

469
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,520
My dad is Jewish
and my mom's Christian,

470
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:54,455
so instead of picking
which religion I am, uh,

471
00:25:54,488 --> 00:25:56,390
they just decided
that I wouldn't have one

472
00:25:56,424 --> 00:25:58,527
and I can choose
when I grow up.

473
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,695
And have you
given that much thought?

474
00:26:01,729 --> 00:26:03,831
Not really. My grandma
wants me to be Jewish.

475
00:26:03,864 --> 00:26:04,965
And your other grandparents

476
00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:07,168
want you to be Christian,
I imagine.

477
00:26:07,201 --> 00:26:09,103
I don't know.
I've never met them before.

478
00:26:09,136 --> 00:26:10,638
They live in Ohio.

479
00:26:10,671 --> 00:26:12,273
So you've never met them
at all?

480
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:15,743
-No.
-Oh.

481
00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:20,014
Well, if I may suggest it,

482
00:26:20,848 --> 00:26:22,850
I feel like
"religion" could be

483
00:26:22,883 --> 00:26:25,186
a very compelling
research topic for you.

484
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:30,224
<i>Tickets are tenth row,</i>

485
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:32,693
<i>dead center, very hard to get.</i>

486
00:26:32,726 --> 00:26:34,662
- Tell her that.
<i>- I will.</i>

487
00:26:34,695 --> 00:26:36,831
-Is she excited?
-She's excited.

488
00:26:36,864 --> 00:26:40,067
Well, I mean, is she excited
or is she just excited?

489
00:26:40,502 --> 00:26:41,969
She's excited.

490
00:26:42,002 --> 00:26:44,638
Okay, okay, okay, okay, I'll
let you go. Well, I'm excited!

491
00:26:44,672 --> 00:26:46,707
-Okay, bye.
<i>-Bye.</i>

492
00:26:47,741 --> 00:26:48,809
Hey.

493
00:26:48,843 --> 00:26:50,512
-Hey.
-What happened to the couch?

494
00:26:50,545 --> 00:26:53,548
Uh, it's time to turn over
a new leaf.

495
00:26:53,582 --> 00:26:55,950
I was thinking
maybe something modern?

496
00:26:55,983 --> 00:26:58,520
I don't know. I have to think
about it. How was school?

497
00:26:58,553 --> 00:27:01,055
You're home a little later
than usual, huh?

498
00:27:01,088 --> 00:27:02,723
Yeah.

499
00:27:02,756 --> 00:27:05,960
Hey. How come I've never met
your mom or dad?

500
00:27:06,927 --> 00:27:08,629
Um...

501
00:27:08,662 --> 00:27:10,498
Well, what made you
think about that?

502
00:27:10,532 --> 00:27:12,066
Just wondering.

503
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:14,768
I mean, I know
that we don't see them

504
00:27:14,802 --> 00:27:16,637
because they're
so far away,

505
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,405
but why don't we
even talk to them?

506
00:27:20,741 --> 00:27:22,877
We just, we just don't.

507
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:25,179
It's, uh... It's, um...

508
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,748
It's such a long story.

509
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:29,083
What do you mean?

510
00:27:29,116 --> 00:27:31,819
I mean,
I'll tell you another time.

511
00:27:31,852 --> 00:27:33,787
Why can't you just
tell me now?

512
00:27:37,191 --> 00:27:38,192
Um...

513
00:27:43,598 --> 00:27:45,699
I just...

514
00:27:50,437 --> 00:27:51,872
Look, I just...

515
00:27:53,575 --> 00:27:54,808
Uh...

516
00:27:56,076 --> 00:27:58,145
So, um...

517
00:27:58,179 --> 00:28:01,282
We don't see
my parents because, um...

518
00:28:03,384 --> 00:28:05,119
They don't want to.

519
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:07,755
What?

520
00:28:07,788 --> 00:28:10,791
My mom and dad are very,
very devout Christians, and...

521
00:28:11,492 --> 00:28:12,927
before you were born,

522
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,497
when your dad
and I first fell in love,

523
00:28:16,531 --> 00:28:21,435
um, they told me that
it would be very hard for them

524
00:28:21,468 --> 00:28:23,137
to, uh, have a...

525
00:28:24,171 --> 00:28:25,172
Sorry.

526
00:28:25,806 --> 00:28:27,808
Jewish son-in-law.

527
00:28:27,841 --> 00:28:29,343
They told me it would be
very hard for them

528
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:31,912
to have a Jewish son-in-law.

529
00:28:31,946 --> 00:28:34,549
And that
if I wanted to marry him,

530
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:36,685
that was my business, but

531
00:28:36,717 --> 00:28:39,353
I wouldn't be
their daughter anymore.

532
00:28:40,788 --> 00:28:42,423
But you are their daughter.

533
00:28:46,227 --> 00:28:51,198
Mmm-hmm. I guess,
um, what I mean is that, um...

534
00:28:53,668 --> 00:28:56,170
They just didn't want me
in their life anymore.

535
00:28:58,372 --> 00:28:59,473
So, I'm not.

536
00:29:04,245 --> 00:29:07,881
- Mom.
- It's okay. Oh, honey.

537
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,852
It was a long time ago.

538
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,822
I have you guys.

539
00:29:14,855 --> 00:29:17,525
Okay, you know what?
I took Dad to the station

540
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:18,859
so we could have the car

541
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:20,794
because we're supposed to
go shopping, remember?

542
00:29:21,596 --> 00:29:23,264
Remember? Bras?

543
00:29:23,297 --> 00:29:24,532
Whoo-hoo.

544
00:29:26,568 --> 00:29:28,869
<i>Are you there, God?</i>
<i>It's me, Margaret.</i>

545
00:29:30,404 --> 00:29:32,072
<i>I can't believe this.</i>

546
00:29:32,106 --> 00:29:34,475
<i>What kind of parents</i>
<i>would do that?</i>

547
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:36,277
<i>And blame it on religion?</i>

548
00:29:37,712 --> 00:29:40,481
<i>God, please</i>
<i>take care of my mom.</i>

549
00:29:40,515 --> 00:29:41,650
<i>She's a good person.</i>

550
00:29:41,683 --> 00:29:43,884
<i>-She's nice to everyone.</i>
-You're welcome.

551
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:45,687
<i>Even when</i>
<i>she doesn't need to be.</i>

552
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,021
-Thank you.
-Can't forget about you.

553
00:29:48,322 --> 00:29:50,291
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>why this happened.</i>

554
00:29:50,324 --> 00:29:53,561
<i>But please, somehow,</i>
<i>make it all okay.</i>

555
00:29:53,595 --> 00:29:55,496
And here are the bras.

556
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:57,798
<i>Oh, also,</i>
<i>I'm getting a bra today.</i>

557
00:29:57,831 --> 00:29:59,800
<i>I'd like something</i>
<i>to put in it, please.</i>

558
00:30:00,568 --> 00:30:01,770
Excuse me.

559
00:30:01,802 --> 00:30:04,773
Uh, we're looking for a bra
for my daughter.

560
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:07,975
Hmm. Well, we don't have
many that small.

561
00:30:08,008 --> 00:30:09,977
But come with me, dear,
I'll measure you.

562
00:30:14,348 --> 00:30:15,449
Arms up, dear.

563
00:30:21,155 --> 00:30:22,189
Hmm.

564
00:30:22,222 --> 00:30:25,826
Barely a 28.
Not even a double-A.

565
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:27,194
Your best bet
is going to be to go with

566
00:30:27,227 --> 00:30:28,996
-one of these Gro-Bras here.
-It's okay.

567
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:31,932
So, one day, when you do grow,
it'll grow with you.

568
00:30:31,965 --> 00:30:33,501
Okay. Thank you very much.

569
00:30:33,535 --> 00:30:36,003
Sure.
- Thanks, we'll just
go try it on.

570
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,276
-Um...
-Hmm? Oh.

571
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:44,713
Yeah. Can I just...
I'll just... Yep.

572
00:30:44,746 --> 00:30:46,815
Here we go.

573
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:49,116
This is
always the tough bit.

574
00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:51,786
I can't even do this
to this day.

575
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:55,456
Okay. All right. Can I see?

576
00:30:58,459 --> 00:31:01,529
-How's that feel?
-I cannot wait to take it off.

577
00:31:01,563 --> 00:31:04,164
Yeah. Welcome to womanhood.

578
00:31:34,461 --> 00:31:35,630
Oh, hello.

579
00:31:35,663 --> 00:31:36,698
Hello.

580
00:31:36,731 --> 00:31:39,933
Look at you. Working the land.

581
00:31:40,702 --> 00:31:42,136
Heavy machinery, ouch.

582
00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:44,438
Be better if I take
my shirt off or it's too much?

583
00:31:44,471 --> 00:31:45,640
Not for me.

584
00:31:46,206 --> 00:31:47,509
Ooh.

585
00:31:47,542 --> 00:31:49,076
There it is, yeah.

586
00:31:51,078 --> 00:31:53,013
You ever been kissed
in the suburbs?

587
00:31:53,046 --> 00:31:54,248
No, sir.

588
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:15,570
I'm Laura Danker.
What's your name?

589
00:32:31,018 --> 00:32:33,020
God damn it!

590
00:32:33,053 --> 00:32:35,956
Oh, my God. Oh,
my God. Did you lose a finger?

591
00:32:35,989 --> 00:32:39,661
It does say,
"Stop the engine motor

592
00:32:39,694 --> 00:32:41,830
"before cleaning the mower,
unclogging the chute."

593
00:32:41,863 --> 00:32:43,096
Whose side are you on?

594
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,732
Well, no, you turn off
the motor before you...

595
00:32:44,766 --> 00:32:45,834
I'm fine.

596
00:32:45,867 --> 00:32:47,602
You have to
turn the motor off, Dad.

597
00:32:57,177 --> 00:32:58,680
<i>Well, time for</i>
<i>Boy Books, everyone.</i>

598
00:32:59,246 --> 00:33:00,548
Who wants to go first?

599
00:33:00,582 --> 00:33:01,583
Like it matters.

600
00:33:01,616 --> 00:33:04,218
We all already know
who everyone put down.

601
00:33:04,819 --> 00:33:06,821
Philip Leroy!

602
00:33:06,855 --> 00:33:08,188
He's so cute.

603
00:33:08,222 --> 00:33:09,456
It's been the same
since second grade.

604
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,959
Well, he looks
better this year.

605
00:33:10,991 --> 00:33:12,426
- Really?
- Yes. He must have gone

606
00:33:12,459 --> 00:33:13,962
-to the beach or something.
-He doesn't look

607
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:15,964
-any different.
-Who'd you put down, Margaret?

608
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:18,800
Yeah, I put him, too.

609
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:20,133
All right, well,
that was quick.

610
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:23,905
Now it's time to check
for the bras.

611
00:33:23,938 --> 00:33:25,673
Gretchen has a bra.

612
00:33:25,707 --> 00:33:27,274
Janie has a bra.

613
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:29,878
Margaret has a bra. Huh.

614
00:33:29,911 --> 00:33:31,411
Now, let's go around
and tell our sizes.

615
00:33:31,445 --> 00:33:35,148
Well, mine didn't say
it had a size.

616
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:37,117
It just said it was a Gro-Bra.

617
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,887
Yeah, I got that one, too.

618
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,187
Oh, same here.

619
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,723
Well, not me.

620
00:33:41,756 --> 00:33:43,323
I'm a 32, double-A.

621
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:47,094
If you want to get out
of those small bras,

622
00:33:47,127 --> 00:33:48,195
you're going to have to do

623
00:33:48,228 --> 00:33:49,697
the same exercising
technique I do.

624
00:33:49,731 --> 00:33:52,299
- There's an exercise?
- Of course there is.

625
00:33:52,332 --> 00:33:53,768
You hold your arms
out like this

626
00:33:53,801 --> 00:33:57,572
and you say, "I must, I must,
I must increase my bust.

627
00:33:57,605 --> 00:34:00,909
"I must, I must,
I must increase my bust."

628
00:34:00,942 --> 00:34:03,310
-Does that really work?
-I'm living proof.

629
00:34:03,343 --> 00:34:06,246
Now come on, get up.
Get up! Get up! Get up!

630
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,415
You'll see. Get up.

631
00:34:08,448 --> 00:34:11,786
I must, I must,
I must increase my bust.

632
00:34:11,819 --> 00:34:13,988
I must,
I must increase my bust.

633
00:34:14,022 --> 00:34:15,355
Chin up!

634
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:18,960
We must, we must,
we must increase our bust.

635
00:34:18,993 --> 00:34:22,931
We must, we must,
we must increase our bust.

636
00:34:22,964 --> 00:34:24,364
"We must, we must,

637
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:26,834
"we must increase our bust."

638
00:34:26,868 --> 00:34:29,069
Shut up! You're so stupid!

639
00:34:29,102 --> 00:34:30,404
- Shut up!
- I can feel it working!

640
00:34:30,437 --> 00:34:32,306
Mom!

641
00:34:33,541 --> 00:34:34,943
Grandma said
she'll pick you up

642
00:34:34,976 --> 00:34:36,044
right where you pull in.

643
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:37,545
-Yes.
-I don't want you to talk to

644
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:38,613
anybody on the bus.

645
00:34:38,646 --> 00:34:39,547
-Especially men.
-Right.

646
00:34:39,581 --> 00:34:40,949
And you find a nice seat
by yourself...

647
00:34:40,982 --> 00:34:42,850
-Okay. Okay, Dad.
-...by the bus driver.

648
00:34:42,884 --> 00:34:44,251
Um, excuse me, sir,
this young lady,

649
00:34:44,284 --> 00:34:45,753
she's traveling
by herself today

650
00:34:45,787 --> 00:34:47,154
and I was just wondering if
you could keep an eye on her?

651
00:34:47,187 --> 00:34:48,288
- Sure, lady.
- Mom, come on.

652
00:34:48,322 --> 00:34:49,356
Okay, good bye. Good bye.

653
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:50,792
-It's going to be fun. Bye.
-Bye!

654
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:52,660
-Okay. Have fun.
-See ya.

655
00:34:52,694 --> 00:34:54,294
Right there, right there!

656
00:34:56,096 --> 00:34:57,331
- Good.
- There you go.

657
00:34:57,364 --> 00:35:00,133
-See ya!
-Independence is good, right?

658
00:35:01,335 --> 00:35:03,403
<i>Are you there, God?</i>
<i>It's me, Margaret.</i>

659
00:35:03,437 --> 00:35:06,874

664

00:36:39,266 --> 00:36:41,035
put gloves on
over that to sleep in.

695
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:42,804
- You know why?
- No.

696
00:36:42,837 --> 00:36:45,338
Okay. You have to promise
not to tell anybody this,

697
00:36:45,372 --> 00:36:46,440
what I'm going to
tell you now.

698
00:36:46,473 --> 00:36:49,043
-Okay? Okay, swear?
-Okay. I swear.

699
00:36:49,077 --> 00:36:50,343
So, I actually did this.

700
00:36:50,377 --> 00:36:51,946
I got a really
fabulous hand cream

701
00:36:51,979 --> 00:36:53,280
and I bought these
white gloves

702
00:36:53,313 --> 00:36:54,615
-and I put them on. All right.
-Oh!

703
00:36:54,649 --> 00:36:56,851
No, I did, I did. And so,
I'm lying there, like,

704
00:36:56,884 --> 00:36:58,086
I must've been asleep,

705
00:36:58,119 --> 00:36:59,286
and you know,
and I must've gone like this

706
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:01,589
and I was, like,
"Ah! Who's in here?"

707
00:37:01,622 --> 00:37:04,759
Because I couldn't
feel my own hands.

708
00:37:06,194 --> 00:37:07,995
I was frightened.

709
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:14,602
Oh, God. You are a fab...
I had the best time tonight.

710
00:37:14,635 --> 00:37:17,337
-It was amazing.
-You are a great date, toots.

711
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:19,173
Oh, my gosh. You are.

712
00:37:19,207 --> 00:37:22,342
Lordy, Lordy.

713
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:24,979
Before I forget,
if you hear, like, a

714
00:37:25,012 --> 00:37:26,681
or a
it's not me.

715
00:37:27,347 --> 00:37:28,983
Okay? You're just dreaming

716
00:37:29,016 --> 00:37:30,885
and you're dreaming.
All right?

717
00:37:30,918 --> 00:37:32,954
Okay. Sweet dreams.

718
00:37:42,029 --> 00:37:43,396
Hey, Grandma.

719
00:37:43,865 --> 00:37:45,298
Yeah, sugar.

720
00:37:46,534 --> 00:37:48,736
Do you think maybe I could go

721
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,437
to the temple
with you sometime?

722
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:53,340
You bet you can.

723
00:37:54,075 --> 00:37:55,843
Really? Really?

724
00:37:56,544 --> 00:37:57,745
Yeah.

725
00:37:57,779 --> 00:38:01,015
We'll go in the morning.
I got to find what to wear.

726
00:38:02,282 --> 00:38:04,351
Welcome.

727
00:38:04,384 --> 00:38:07,387
-Welcome.
-My granddaughter
is here with me today.

728
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,656
<i>Shabbat Shalom.</i>

729
00:38:08,689 --> 00:38:11,526
My granddaughter.
My granddaughter.

730
00:38:15,997 --> 00:38:18,699
There's the rabbi.
He's the best in the city.

731
00:38:18,733 --> 00:38:21,002
Two hours, in and out,
bing, bang, boom.

732
00:38:22,003 --> 00:38:23,470
Welcome, dear friends.

733
00:38:23,504 --> 00:38:25,006
Oh, it's starting.

734
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:26,373
<i>Shabbat Shalom.</i>

735
00:38:26,406 --> 00:38:27,842
<i>Shabbat Shalom.</i>

736
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:30,077
<i>Shabbat Shalom</i>
means "hello," "goodbye,"

737
00:38:30,111 --> 00:38:31,746
"peace and harmony,"
and other stuff.

738
00:38:31,779 --> 00:38:33,413
...in thanks to God
this morning.

739
00:38:33,446 --> 00:38:37,919
We open our prayer books
and we turn to page 26.

740
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,417
Agree to the terms

741
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:12,385
of their covenant with God.

742
00:39:12,419 --> 00:39:14,155
<i>Shabbat Shalom.</i>

743
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:15,756
Oh, that was lovely.

744
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:16,791
Oh!

745
00:39:18,259 --> 00:39:21,361
Oh, sweetheart.
Congratulations.

746
00:39:21,394 --> 00:39:23,130
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

747
00:39:25,766 --> 00:39:27,034
<i>I don't know, God.</i>

748
00:39:27,068 --> 00:39:29,469
<i>The people seem nice</i>
<i>and I like the music,</i>

749
00:39:29,503 --> 00:39:33,574
<i>but I guess I expected</i>
<i>something else?</i>

750
00:39:33,608 --> 00:39:37,845
<i>I don't know what exactly.</i>
<i>A feeling, maybe?</i>

751
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,515
I can't believe
that she took you to temple

752
00:39:41,549 --> 00:39:42,750
without even asking us.

753
00:39:42,783 --> 00:39:44,252
I'm honestly surprised
it took her so long.

754
00:39:44,285 --> 00:39:46,419
I told you guys
that it was my idea.

755
00:39:46,453 --> 00:39:48,455
I just wanted to try it out.

756
00:39:48,488 --> 00:39:50,625
I'm going to try church, too,
Mom, so don't freak out.

757
00:39:50,658 --> 00:39:51,692
I don't care about church.

758
00:39:51,726 --> 00:39:53,361
I don't want you
to go to church.

759
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:55,395
I don't think you should be
bothering yourself

760
00:39:55,428 --> 00:39:56,898
with any of this stuff
right now.

761
00:39:56,931 --> 00:39:58,833
You said that I can choose my
own religion when I grow up.

762
00:39:58,866 --> 00:40:01,269
Yeah, when you grow up.
When you're an adult.

763
00:40:01,302 --> 00:40:02,637
I'm almost 12.

764
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:05,405
- That's almost an adult.
- Honey, no.

765
00:40:06,607 --> 00:40:09,476
Margaret. Honey.

766
00:40:10,044 --> 00:40:11,379
I shouldn't have laughed.

767
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:13,648
-It was funny.
-I just...

768
00:40:13,681 --> 00:40:15,182
I don't want her to go through
any of it.

769
00:40:15,216 --> 00:40:18,418
I don't either. But it might
not be the worst thing.

770
00:40:19,452 --> 00:40:20,554
Think about it.

771
00:40:20,588 --> 00:40:22,189
What does that mean?

772
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:23,824
Well...

773
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:26,928
she'll go to a couple of
endless services

774
00:40:26,961 --> 00:40:28,495
and then, she'll realize
how lucky she was

775
00:40:28,529 --> 00:40:29,864
we never made her go.

776
00:40:30,731 --> 00:40:32,633
Know what got me off
going to temple?

777
00:40:32,667 --> 00:40:34,735
-What?
-Going to temple.

778
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:36,237
You don't understand
a word they're saying.

779
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,705
And you sit there
for a long time.

780
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,841
Oh, honey. Oh.

781
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:42,710
-What?
-I am so sorry. I am...

782
00:40:42,743 --> 00:40:44,477
-What?
-I swear I'm going to

783
00:40:44,512 --> 00:40:46,280
buy the furniture.

784
00:40:46,314 --> 00:40:47,648
This is all I need.

785
00:40:47,682 --> 00:40:49,050
Look at it. And look...

786
00:40:51,752 --> 00:40:52,920
Oh, God!

787
00:40:53,721 --> 00:40:56,090
Find me a couch
that does this.

788
00:40:56,123 --> 00:40:57,959
Okay?

789
00:41:00,161 --> 00:41:03,064
You know how ugly the ceiling
in our gymnasium is?

790
00:41:03,097 --> 00:41:04,265
-It is.
-Yes, it is.

791
00:41:04,298 --> 00:41:08,336
We'll have it refinished,
paint it completely black

792
00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:11,906
and then we'll cut out
little stars

793
00:41:12,807 --> 00:41:15,376
and recreate the night sky.

794
00:41:16,644 --> 00:41:17,912
-Oh, that's sweet.
-How lovely.

795
00:41:17,945 --> 00:41:20,514
So how many stars
would we need?

796
00:41:21,382 --> 00:41:23,818
Oh, I was thinking five
or 10,000.

797
00:41:26,053 --> 00:41:27,487
It shouldn't take us long.

798
00:41:27,521 --> 00:41:29,323
I've got some
scissors right here.

799
00:41:29,357 --> 00:41:31,659
Okay.

800
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,228
Promenade right.

801
00:41:36,931 --> 00:41:39,066
Now, single file.

802
00:41:42,303 --> 00:41:44,638
And that's it. Yeah!

803
00:41:44,672 --> 00:41:45,973
All right, great.

804
00:41:46,007 --> 00:41:48,009
It's the effort that counts.
Have a good evening.

805
00:41:48,042 --> 00:41:50,544
-I'm so glad this is done.
-Yeah, that sucked.

806
00:41:50,578 --> 00:41:52,046
-It took forever.
-Norman's horrible.

807
00:41:54,582 --> 00:41:57,651
Guys.
Gretchen got the book.

808
00:41:57,685 --> 00:41:59,887
- What book?
- You know...

809
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,890
My dad's anatomy book
that I told you about?

810
00:42:09,563 --> 00:42:12,366
It looks like a thumb.

811
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,702
What?

812
00:42:17,772 --> 00:42:20,174
-Oh.
-It's so saggy.

813
00:42:21,442 --> 00:42:23,444
It's a wobbly blob.

814
00:42:23,477 --> 00:42:25,746
My brother's looks like that.

815
00:42:26,647 --> 00:42:27,915
-Ew.
-How do you know?

816
00:42:27,948 --> 00:42:29,417
He walks around naked.
I see it.

817
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:30,751
It's not a pleasant sight.

818
00:42:30,785 --> 00:42:32,186
I never want to see
anyone naked,

819
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:33,254
or have anyone see me naked.

820
00:42:33,287 --> 00:42:34,488
It's just gross.

821
00:42:34,523 --> 00:42:36,223
Come on. What about
when you get married?

822
00:42:36,257 --> 00:42:37,658
Especially then.

823
00:42:37,691 --> 00:42:40,027
Janie, once you grow a little,

824
00:42:40,061 --> 00:42:41,962
you'll want the whole world
to see you.

825
00:42:41,996 --> 00:42:44,098
Just like the girls
in <i>Playboy.</i>

826
00:42:44,131 --> 00:42:45,633
What girls in <i>Playboy?</i>

827
00:42:45,666 --> 00:42:49,036
- You've never seen...
<i>- Playboy?</i>

828
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:51,405
Where would I see it?

829
00:42:51,439 --> 00:42:53,007
My dad gets <i>Playboy.</i>

830
00:42:54,275 --> 00:42:57,745
Wait. So you have a copy here,
in this house?

831
00:42:57,778 --> 00:42:59,480
Well, I don't know
where it is.

832
00:42:59,514 --> 00:43:00,981
Of course you know
where it is.

833
00:43:01,015 --> 00:43:01,982
Go on.

834
00:43:02,016 --> 00:43:03,951
- I don't know.
- Margaret, come on.

835
00:43:03,984 --> 00:43:06,620
-Go get it.
-Go get it, Margaret.

836
00:43:08,122 --> 00:43:09,657
<i>You don't want</i>
<i>to overcook</i>

837
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:11,659
<i>and you don't want to</i>
<i>start cooking</i>

838
00:43:11,692 --> 00:43:13,260
<i>the bouillabaisse</i>
<i>until just the last minute,</i>

839
00:43:13,294 --> 00:43:14,295
<i>because you've got your...</i>

840
00:43:21,869 --> 00:43:24,805
Look how round they are.

841
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:27,041
Mine just look like
little wizard hats.

842
00:43:28,776 --> 00:43:30,678

Uh, New Year's cards.

860
00:45:34,201 --> 00:45:35,769
Um, I'm trying to get
on top of it this year.

861
00:45:35,803 --> 00:45:37,438
-Yeah.
-Um, oh, there's the mailman.

862
00:45:37,471 --> 00:45:39,006
-Can you...
You've got your boots on?
-Yeah.

863
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:40,675
-Can you just run those
out to him?
-Sure.

-Of course.

00:46:03,764 --> 00:46:05,099
<i>So,</i>
<i>who's Norman Fisher?</i>

868
00:46:05,132 --> 00:46:07,669
This weird kid in my class.

869
00:46:07,702 --> 00:46:09,270
I don't even know
why he invited me.

870
00:46:09,303 --> 00:46:10,505
I barely know him.

871
00:46:15,175 --> 00:46:16,977
-Hello?
-Did you get invited

872
00:46:17,011 --> 00:46:18,879
to stupid Norman Fisher's
birthday party?

873
00:46:18,912 --> 00:46:20,047
Yeah. You did, too?

874
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,448
Everyone did. The whole class.

875
00:46:21,482 --> 00:46:23,817
Janie, Gretchen, everyone.
Even Philip Leroy.

876
00:46:23,851 --> 00:46:26,688
-Even Laura Danker?
<i>-I said everybody.</i>

877
00:46:26,721 --> 00:46:28,922
<i>Anyways, my mom</i>
<i>talked to Norman's mom</i>

878
00:46:28,956 --> 00:46:30,558
and I guess it's
a big deal dinner party.

879
00:46:30,592 --> 00:46:32,560
We have to look
extremely nice.

880
00:46:40,434 --> 00:46:41,468
Ow!

881
00:46:41,503 --> 00:46:43,103
Ready? Lean on back.

882
00:46:45,439 --> 00:46:46,541
No. No, no, no.

883
00:46:47,676 --> 00:46:49,476
Where are my shoes?

884
00:46:50,512 --> 00:46:51,513
Oh, my God!

885
00:46:55,249 --> 00:46:56,250
Mom!

886
00:46:59,754 --> 00:47:00,988
There we go.

887
00:47:01,021 --> 00:47:03,991
Oh, this is gonna look
so pre... Stop moving!

888
00:47:07,796 --> 00:47:11,065
-We are done.
-Yes!

889
00:47:11,098 --> 00:47:12,466
Okay, we're done.
Come on. Mom.

890
00:47:12,499 --> 00:47:13,867
Perfect. One more
for your body. One more.

891
00:47:13,901 --> 00:47:15,836
Okay, let's go. Mom, no!

892
00:47:15,869 --> 00:47:18,205
Okay. Wait.
One more time. Please.

893
00:47:18,238 --> 00:47:19,873
I'm going
to get these printed.

894
00:47:19,907 --> 00:47:21,375
-It's weird.
-Okay, here. Just push them...

895
00:47:21,408 --> 00:47:23,077
Lick them with your fingers
and stick it back.

896
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:24,411
You got to go, you got to go.

897
00:47:27,014 --> 00:47:28,849
Bye! Thank you, Jan.

898
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:32,687
My God,

899
00:47:32,721 --> 00:47:33,921
I am so excited
for all of us to do this.

900
00:47:39,594 --> 00:47:40,729
All right, I'll just, um...

901
00:47:40,762 --> 00:47:42,697
- Just, just...
- Okay.

902
00:47:42,731 --> 00:47:45,600
I'll just... Yeah, okay.
Have fun.

903
00:48:02,684 --> 00:48:04,051
He's hilarious.

904
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:11,559
How come she never
talks to anybody?

905
00:48:11,593 --> 00:48:12,960
I don't know.

906
00:48:12,993 --> 00:48:15,462
Because she's too busy
doing other stuff, that's why.

907
00:48:18,031 --> 00:48:19,967
Now, if everybody's
had enough to eat,

908
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,404
we can start the games.

909
00:48:23,437 --> 00:48:24,672
The games?

910
00:48:29,611 --> 00:48:31,011
I'll spin first.

911
00:48:44,692 --> 00:48:46,694
Ooh!

912
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:59,173
Okay. Now,
it's Janie's turn to spin.

913
00:49:07,682 --> 00:49:10,217
-This is a great party.
-Do we have to play this game?

914
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:13,020
Well then, let's play
a different game, huh?

915
00:49:13,053 --> 00:49:16,056
I have one. It's called
Two Minutes in the Closet.

916
00:49:16,457 --> 00:49:17,559
What's that?

917
00:49:17,592 --> 00:49:18,693
Well, we all get a number,

918
00:49:18,726 --> 00:49:21,796
and then somebody will
call out, like, number six

919
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:22,931
and then those two

920
00:49:22,963 --> 00:49:25,232
will go into the closet
and, you know...

921
00:49:25,265 --> 00:49:27,167
Ooh!

922
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:33,340
Number three.

923
00:49:37,211 --> 00:49:38,345
Who's number three?

924
00:49:38,378 --> 00:49:40,748
Somebody's got to be
number three.

925
00:49:49,323 --> 00:49:51,091
Go ahead. Into the bathroom.

926
00:49:51,124 --> 00:49:53,595
Somebody get Freddy
a step stool.

927
00:50:04,204 --> 00:50:05,640
What do you think
they're doing?

928
00:50:05,673 --> 00:50:07,742
I'm sorry.

929
00:50:10,912 --> 00:50:14,481
Ooh!

930
00:50:15,917 --> 00:50:17,217
You're next.

931
00:50:19,888 --> 00:50:24,491
I pick number... 12.

932
00:50:31,633 --> 00:50:32,634
What?

933
00:50:33,501 --> 00:50:34,502
You're 12?

934
00:50:36,905 --> 00:50:39,106
Ooh!

935
00:50:50,018 --> 00:50:51,418
Nice.

936
00:50:51,986 --> 00:50:53,220
Sorry.

937
00:51:19,346 --> 00:51:21,716
Margaret, turn around.

938
00:51:31,693 --> 00:51:32,727
Um...

939
00:51:33,528 --> 00:51:34,562
So...

940
00:51:36,463 --> 00:51:37,532
Hi.

941
00:51:38,298 --> 00:51:39,299
Hey.

942
00:51:40,935 --> 00:51:42,135
So...

943
00:52:13,101 --> 00:52:14,902
So, the kiss
was really good?

944
00:52:14,936 --> 00:52:18,238
They were
pretty good kisses. Yeah.

945
00:52:18,271 --> 00:52:21,609
Kisses? He kissed you
more than once?

946
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:24,612
Like, how many times?

947
00:52:24,646 --> 00:52:26,246
About five, I think.

948
00:52:27,147 --> 00:52:29,483
I don't know.
I think I lost count.

949
00:52:31,686 --> 00:52:33,755
<i>I know I shouldn't be</i>
<i>enjoying this, God,</i>

950
00:52:33,788 --> 00:52:36,323
<i>but it's just too good.</i>

951
00:52:36,356 --> 00:52:38,693
<i>Sorry, sorry,</i>
<i>I'm going to focus.</i>

952
00:52:43,163 --> 00:52:45,399
The Book of Isaiah,
chapter nine,

953
00:52:45,432 --> 00:52:47,200
verses six and seven says,

954
00:52:47,234 --> 00:52:52,507
"For unto us a child is born.
Unto us, a son is given

955
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:55,208
"and he will be called
Wonderful Counselor,

956
00:52:55,242 --> 00:52:58,613
"Mighty God,
Everlasting Father"

957
00:52:58,646 --> 00:53:01,082
<i>If only you could</i>
<i>give me a hint, God.</i>

958
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:04,786
<i>I'm more confused than ever.</i>

959
00:53:06,087 --> 00:53:07,855
<i>Which religion should I be?</i>

960
00:53:09,557 --> 00:53:11,159
<i>Sometimes I just wish</i>
<i>I'd been born</i>

961
00:53:11,191 --> 00:53:12,593
<i>one way or the other.</i>

962
00:53:40,054 --> 00:53:41,589
Hi, there.
This is Barbara calling,

963
00:53:41,622 --> 00:53:43,658
from Delano Elementary School.

964
00:53:43,691 --> 00:53:46,961
And we're just
looking for, uh... donations.

965
00:53:47,662 --> 00:53:49,097
Sorry.

966
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:52,265
Oh, God. I didn't realize
it was dinner.

967
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,902
Okay. Bye-bye.

968
00:54:17,058 --> 00:54:18,258
Hi.

969
00:54:26,333 --> 00:54:27,568
Don't go, don't go, don't go.

970
00:54:29,402 --> 00:54:32,472
I can't believe
you're still there. Okay.

971
00:54:37,612 --> 00:54:38,613
Okay.

972
00:54:50,057 --> 00:54:51,391
No.

973
00:54:56,631 --> 00:54:57,532
Jan.

974
00:54:57,565 --> 00:55:00,333
I just popped by
to pick up your stars.

975
00:55:00,802 --> 00:55:03,436
Yes. Um...

976
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:06,306
Uh, I've been cleaning.
Come on in.

977
00:55:06,339 --> 00:55:10,545
Um, I'll just,
uh, get the stars.

978
00:55:10,578 --> 00:55:14,549
Um, they're,
they're almost, uh, ready.

979
00:55:15,817 --> 00:55:18,953
You know,
I ordered furniture and, um,

980
00:55:18,986 --> 00:55:21,388
-they still haven't sent it.
-Oh, my gosh.

981
00:55:21,421 --> 00:55:23,224
So crazy. Okay, stars. Um...

982
00:55:23,257 --> 00:55:25,693
Stars. Stars. Stars.

983
00:55:27,895 --> 00:55:29,197
Thank you.

984
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:31,165
Oh, and don't say anything,

985
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:34,202
but Deb's stars
are a little lopsided.

986
00:55:34,235 --> 00:55:35,402
Oh.

987
00:55:35,435 --> 00:55:37,305
You know, yours are so good.

988
00:55:37,337 --> 00:55:38,539
Thank you.

989
00:55:38,573 --> 00:55:41,008
You think you could do
her allotment, too?

990
00:55:41,042 --> 00:55:42,910
Just between the two of us?

991
00:55:44,111 --> 00:55:45,947
Sure... Yes.

992
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:49,382
Ah. Thank you.
You are such a doll.

993
00:55:49,416 --> 00:55:53,453
Well, I better get going.
There's lots to do still.

994
00:55:53,486 --> 00:55:55,189
-I'll get the door there.
-Thank you.

995
00:55:55,223 --> 00:55:56,691
Okay.

996
00:55:56,724 --> 00:55:58,358
Okay, bye.
Thank you for these.

997
00:55:58,391 --> 00:56:00,127
Bye, Jan. Sure, anytime.

998
00:56:12,372 --> 00:56:13,574
Hello, girls.

999
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:15,375
I'm Mrs. Webster.

1000
00:56:15,408 --> 00:56:17,211
And I am here
to speak to you today

1001
00:56:17,245 --> 00:56:18,813
about your changing bodies.

1002
00:56:21,215 --> 00:56:24,285
Told you this was
the big sex movie.

1003
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:25,519
Some of you may have

1004
00:56:25,553 --> 00:56:28,623
already begun
to experience these changes.

1005
00:56:28,656 --> 00:56:31,158
While others of you still
haven't experienced

1006
00:56:31,192 --> 00:56:33,127
a single change at all.

1007
00:56:34,161 --> 00:56:36,163
We're going to watch
a short film

1008
00:56:36,197 --> 00:56:37,999
to learn a little bit more.

1009
00:56:52,647 --> 00:56:54,081
<i>All girls are unique.</i>

1010
00:56:54,115 --> 00:56:57,551
<i>But sometime, between the ages</i>
<i>of nine and 16</i>

1011
00:56:57,585 --> 00:57:00,821
<i>one very special thing</i>
<i>happens to every girl,</i>

1012
00:57:00,855 --> 00:57:02,489
<i>menstruation.</i>

1013
00:57:03,791 --> 00:57:07,361
<i>Once a month, a velvety lining</i>
<i>of blood and tissue</i>

1014
00:57:07,395 --> 00:57:09,530
<i>forms in her uterus</i>
<i>to make a warm,</i>

1015
00:57:09,563 --> 00:57:12,967
<i>nutritious place</i>
<i>for a baby to grow.</i>

1016
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:17,271
<i>If a baby is not conceived,</i>
<i>the lining is not needed.</i>

1017
00:57:17,305 --> 00:57:21,342
<i>And so, the blood is released</i>
<i>through the vagina.</i>

1018
00:57:21,375 --> 00:57:24,278
<i>That's menstruation.</i>

1019
00:57:24,312 --> 00:57:25,947
Who do you think
will get it first?

1020
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,015
Who do you think
will get it last?

1021
00:57:30,051 --> 00:57:32,253
I honestly don't know
what's taking me so long

1022
00:57:32,286 --> 00:57:33,955
to get this dumb furniture.

1023
00:57:33,988 --> 00:57:35,823
I guess I just want our house
to look like one of those

1024
00:57:35,856 --> 00:57:38,491
nice little houses
nice little families have.

1025
00:57:40,194 --> 00:57:41,461
Do you like these egg chairs?

1026
00:57:41,494 --> 00:57:43,564
When did you get your period?

1027
00:57:45,399 --> 00:57:46,434
Um...

1028
00:57:46,466 --> 00:57:48,135
Just tell me how old you were.

1029
00:57:48,169 --> 00:57:51,806
I... I think I was 14?

1030
00:57:52,773 --> 00:57:54,342
That late?

1031
00:57:54,375 --> 00:57:55,609
That's not late, actually.

1032
00:57:55,643 --> 00:57:57,645
I mean, I had a cousin
who was 16.

1033
00:57:57,678 --> 00:57:59,947
Sixteen? Oh, my God.

1034
00:57:59,981 --> 00:58:02,950
I'd...
I'd die if I didn't get it

1035
00:58:02,984 --> 00:58:04,318
before I was 16.

1036
00:58:04,352 --> 00:58:05,920
Honey, you will get it

1037
00:58:05,953 --> 00:58:08,488
exactly when
you're supposed to get it.

1038
00:58:08,522 --> 00:58:09,790
Don't worry about it.

1039
00:58:12,093 --> 00:58:13,694
My mom got me
Radio City tickets

1040
00:58:13,728 --> 00:58:15,629
since I got all straight A's.

1041
00:58:15,663 --> 00:58:17,732
Um, does anybody want to come?

1042
00:58:17,765 --> 00:58:20,001
Only bad thing is, is my
brother and Moose are coming.

1043
00:58:20,034 --> 00:58:21,869
-Oh, I'll go.
-Okay.

1044
00:58:24,138 --> 00:58:25,139
I got it.

1045
00:58:26,107 --> 00:58:27,141
Got what?

1046
00:58:28,075 --> 00:58:29,643
My period.

1047
00:58:31,979 --> 00:58:34,248
I just don't really understand
how you got it first

1048
00:58:34,281 --> 00:58:35,549
when I have way more than you.

1049
00:58:35,583 --> 00:58:36,984
Well, that doesn't
mean anything.

1050
00:58:37,018 --> 00:58:38,619
-Yes, it does, Gretchen.
-Okay, just tell us

1051
00:58:38,652 --> 00:58:41,088
-how it happened.
-Start from
the very beginning.

1052
00:58:42,623 --> 00:58:46,494
Well, I was sitting there
at dinner

1053
00:58:46,527 --> 00:58:47,962
eating my meatloaf

1054
00:58:47,995 --> 00:58:50,631
and I felt something
coming out of me.

1055
00:58:51,265 --> 00:58:52,867
So I went to the bathroom,

1056
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:56,871
pulled down my pants and
that's when I saw the blood.

1057
00:58:58,606 --> 00:59:00,174
So I called my mom

1058
00:59:00,207 --> 00:59:01,442
and I showed her.

1059
00:59:01,475 --> 00:59:03,477
And she got some

1060
00:59:03,512 --> 00:59:06,347
"sanitary napkins,"
as she calls them.

1061
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:08,182
I put one on and...

1062
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:11,786
Well, that's the whole thing.

1063
00:59:13,888 --> 00:59:16,590
That's the whole thing?
Just that?

1064
00:59:16,624 --> 00:59:18,292
- I told you everything.
- No.

1065
00:59:18,325 --> 00:59:20,428
There has to be
something more.

1066
00:59:20,461 --> 00:59:22,730
My sister said
that it kinda has a smell.

1067
00:59:22,763 --> 00:59:24,632
But I haven't
noticed that yet.

1068
00:59:24,665 --> 00:59:26,567
A smell? Like what?

1069
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:29,003
She said it kinda smells
like the monkey bars.

1070
00:59:29,036 --> 00:59:31,739
- The monkey bars? Ugh.
- Yeah.

1071
00:59:31,772 --> 00:59:33,908
I used to love
the monkey bars.

1072
00:59:33,941 --> 00:59:38,212
But do you feel older now?
Like more mature?

1073
00:59:38,245 --> 00:59:39,580
Oh, yeah.

1074
00:59:39,613 --> 00:59:41,550
I don't know how to explain it

1075
00:59:41,582 --> 00:59:43,518
and you won't understand it
till you get it,

1076
00:59:43,552 --> 00:59:46,620
but I feel like
everything's changed.

1077
00:59:46,654 --> 00:59:47,822
Are you there, God?
It's me, Margaret.

1078
00:59:47,855 --> 00:59:49,457
I've never been
so jealous my entire life

1079
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:50,658
and I hate myself
for being jealous.

1080
00:59:50,691 --> 00:59:52,860
Just please,
please just let me grow

1081
00:59:52,893 --> 00:59:54,261
and let me get my period.

1082
00:59:54,295 --> 00:59:56,330
Let me just be normal
and regular like everybody else.

1083
00:59:56,363 --> 00:59:57,465
Just please, please,

1084
00:59:57,498 --> 00:59:59,033
please, please, please,
please, please!

1085
01:00:02,169 --> 01:00:03,637
Amen.

1086
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:07,475
I don't know
if I want to do this.

1087
01:00:07,509 --> 01:00:09,977
It's fine.
It's just so that we're ready.

1088
01:00:10,579 --> 01:00:12,012
Just in case.

1089
01:00:19,286 --> 01:00:20,287
Come on.

1090
01:00:21,355 --> 01:00:22,723
Okay.

1091
01:00:26,861 --> 01:00:28,863
Next in line, please.

1092
01:00:29,531 --> 01:00:31,031
Please, God, let it be a lady.

1093
01:00:32,366 --> 01:00:33,667
Please.

1094
01:00:34,235 --> 01:00:35,803
Thank you.

1095
01:00:39,273 --> 01:00:41,041
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

1096
01:00:41,075 --> 01:00:42,710
-No...
-Let's just put them back.

1097
01:00:42,743 --> 01:00:45,279
No, come on. Come on.

1098
01:01:17,546 --> 01:01:18,879
-Oh, my God!
-Oh!

1099
01:01:23,552 --> 01:01:26,220
The Tic Tacs!

1100
01:01:27,656 --> 01:01:29,658
-Why the Tic Tacs?
-I don't know.

1101
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:32,193
-Everything worked out.
-Oh, man.

1102
01:02:17,438 --> 01:02:20,007
Uh, come in.

1103
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:24,044
-Hi.
-Hey.

1104
01:02:24,078 --> 01:02:26,046
Uh, you've got a postcard.

1105
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:29,149
-Oh. Thanks.
-Who's in D.C.?

1106
01:02:29,183 --> 01:02:33,354
Uh, Nancy. Uh, they went
for President's Day.

1107
01:02:34,188 --> 01:02:35,456
-Oh.
-Yeah.

1108
01:02:35,489 --> 01:02:37,191
Okay.

1109
01:02:37,224 --> 01:02:39,893
-You want the door closed?
-Yeah. Sure.

1110
01:02:45,634 --> 01:02:46,967
"I got it"?

1111
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:52,439
Oh, come on!

1112
01:03:03,951 --> 01:03:07,921
Hello? Simon residence.
Sylvia speaking.

1113
01:03:07,955 --> 01:03:09,223
<i>Grandma?</i>

1114
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:12,793
Margaret? What's wrong?

1115
01:03:13,494 --> 01:03:15,029
I just really miss you.

1116
01:03:15,396 --> 01:03:16,397
<i>Oh, honey.</i>

1117
01:03:16,698 --> 01:03:18,098
Me, too.

1118
01:03:18,132 --> 01:03:20,635
<i>I'll be back next week</i>
<i>to see the Rockettes and...</i>

1119
01:03:20,669 --> 01:03:22,671
maybe could I come down

1120
01:03:22,704 --> 01:03:24,673
and stay the night
like we did last time?

1121
01:03:24,706 --> 01:03:26,440
<i>Oh, sweetheart.</i>

1122
01:03:26,473 --> 01:03:29,009
I'd love to, I'd love...
But I...

1123
01:03:29,476 --> 01:03:30,477
<i>Well...</i>

1124
01:03:33,548 --> 01:03:35,617
I'm going to be
in Florida then.

1125
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:38,252
<i>I, uh, I heard about</i>
<i>this hotel</i>

1126
01:03:38,285 --> 01:03:41,822
and there's a lot of people
my age there and, uh...

1127
01:03:41,855 --> 01:03:44,358
Um, okay.

1128
01:03:44,391 --> 01:03:46,561
Wait a minute. Wait. Um...

1129
01:03:47,696 --> 01:03:49,930
What if you
fly down to Florida

1130
01:03:49,963 --> 01:03:51,533
and spend a few days with me?

1131
01:03:51,566 --> 01:03:54,868
<i>-Isn't your spring break soon?</i>
-Yeah. The end of April.

1132
01:03:54,902 --> 01:03:56,937
Perfect! I'll still be there.

1133
01:03:56,970 --> 01:03:58,439
I'll ask Mom and Dad.

1134
01:03:58,472 --> 01:04:00,107
Oh, great!

1135
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:02,910
<i>That's my girl. Bye, darling.</i>

1136
01:04:08,315 --> 01:04:10,050
Come on, come on!
Front row tickets!

1137
01:04:10,084 --> 01:04:13,588
-Front row tickets, remember?
-I'm coming! Yes, coming!

1138
01:04:14,723 --> 01:04:16,023
I'm so excited.

1139
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:19,960
Hi.

1140
01:04:20,528 --> 01:04:21,862
-Hi.
-Hey.

1141
01:04:46,019 --> 01:04:48,422
-Excuse me.
-Okay.

1142
01:04:48,757 --> 01:04:49,957
Thank you.

1143
01:05:03,904 --> 01:05:05,005
Sorry. Lefty.

1144
01:05:05,038 --> 01:05:06,541
Oh, no, it's okay.

1145
01:05:09,778 --> 01:05:11,178
Do you know if
the waiter's anywhere?

1146
01:05:11,211 --> 01:05:14,348
Oh. You can have mine.
I didn't drink any out of it.

1147
01:05:14,783 --> 01:05:15,983
Thanks.

1148
01:05:17,418 --> 01:05:18,419
Hey.

1149
01:05:20,789 --> 01:05:21,922
Do you know something

1150
01:05:21,955 --> 01:05:23,658
I've always liked
about you, Margaret?

1151
01:05:23,691 --> 01:05:25,025
-No?
-Come with me.

1152
01:05:25,058 --> 01:05:26,360
I got to go to the bathroom.

1153
01:05:26,393 --> 01:05:28,462
We'll be right back.
Don't touch my food.

1154
01:05:31,231 --> 01:05:33,233
You know, I've had to go
since we got here...

1155
01:05:34,401 --> 01:05:36,403
...and then I drank, like,
three 7Ups or something.

1156
01:05:36,437 --> 01:05:37,872
Uh-huh.

1157
01:05:41,676 --> 01:05:42,710
Oh, no.

1158
01:05:43,745 --> 01:05:45,078
-Oh, no.
-What?

1159
01:05:45,613 --> 01:05:47,281
Oh, please. Oh, no.

1160
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:49,684
Nancy?

1161
01:05:51,385 --> 01:05:52,754
Oh, no.

1162
01:05:52,787 --> 01:05:53,954
Nancy, what's wrong?

1163
01:05:53,987 --> 01:05:55,122
Go get my mom, Margaret.

1164
01:05:55,155 --> 01:05:56,858
-What's going on?
-Go get my mom.

1165
01:05:56,891 --> 01:05:58,760
-Please, quick.
-Let me in.

1166
01:05:58,793 --> 01:06:01,995
Please, please just
go get my mom!

1167
01:06:02,029 --> 01:06:03,964
Okay, okay,
I'll be right back.

1168
01:06:06,668 --> 01:06:10,103
Mrs. Wheeler, Nancy's crying.
She needs you.

1169
01:06:10,137 --> 01:06:12,372
Oh, oh. All right.

1170
01:06:18,245 --> 01:06:19,079
Nancy?

1171
01:06:19,112 --> 01:06:21,649
-Nancy?
-Oh, Mom, please help me.

1172
01:06:21,683 --> 01:06:23,952
-Please help me. Please.
-The door's locked, Nancy.

1173
01:06:23,984 --> 01:06:25,352
I can't get in.
You have to unlock it.

1174
01:06:25,385 --> 01:06:28,088
-I can't open it, I can't.
-Yes, you can, Nancy.

1175
01:06:28,121 --> 01:06:30,324
Unlock this door. Come on.

1176
01:06:31,826 --> 01:06:33,060
Let me in.

1177
01:06:39,868 --> 01:06:40,902
What's going on?

1178
01:06:42,469 --> 01:06:44,706
All right, all right,
calm down.

1179
01:06:44,739 --> 01:06:46,206
Calm down, I can't help you.

1180
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,643
Hmm? Hey, look at me.
Calm down.

1181
01:06:48,676 --> 01:06:51,679
I can't help you if you don't
stop crying and talk to me.

1182
01:06:55,415 --> 01:06:57,552
Hey. What is it?

1183
01:07:05,727 --> 01:07:09,429
Oh. Well, all right. Um...

1184
01:07:11,064 --> 01:07:12,567
Here. We'll just, uh...

1185
01:07:14,468 --> 01:07:15,770
Margaret?

1186
01:07:15,803 --> 01:07:17,137
Margaret.

1187
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:21,009
Would you get Nancy
a pad, please

1188
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:23,477
from the dispenser
on the wall?

1189
01:07:25,112 --> 01:07:27,347
She got her period, sweetie.

1190
01:07:27,381 --> 01:07:29,617
Does she always act like that?

1191
01:07:29,651 --> 01:07:33,153
Well, it's her first time.
She's just a little scared.

1192
01:07:46,801 --> 01:07:47,835
Thank you, sweetie.

1193
01:07:49,202 --> 01:07:50,638
All right. Yeah?

1194
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:53,808
All right.

1195
01:07:55,643 --> 01:07:57,377
Well, you girls wash up.

1196
01:07:57,411 --> 01:08:00,080
I'm going to go tell
the others not to worry.

1197
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:06,219
Not too long now. Okay?

1198
01:08:37,184 --> 01:08:40,487
<i>Are you there, God?</i>
<i>It's me, Margaret.</i>

1199
01:08:42,090 --> 01:08:44,124
<i>I don't even know what to say.</i>

1200
01:09:04,979 --> 01:09:06,648
I'm going to Florida?

1201
01:09:07,515 --> 01:09:09,884
-Happy birthday.
-Mom. Thank you so much.

1202
01:09:15,422 --> 01:09:16,423
Hey!

1203
01:09:17,525 --> 01:09:19,827
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

1204
01:09:19,861 --> 01:09:21,328
Why do we have
different seats?

1205
01:09:21,361 --> 01:09:23,665
He said we're in groups
to study different countries.

1206
01:09:49,624 --> 01:09:51,291
Oh. Hey.

1207
01:09:51,324 --> 01:09:53,895
Hey. Happy birthday.

1208
01:09:53,928 --> 01:09:54,962
-Thanks.
-Oh, and, uh,

1209
01:09:54,996 --> 01:09:58,166
-I got you something.
-Ow!

1210
01:09:58,198 --> 01:10:00,034
It's a pinch to grow an inch.

1211
01:10:00,068 --> 01:10:03,437
And you know where
you need that inch. Hey.

1212
01:10:06,373 --> 01:10:08,743
<i>Are you there, God?</i>
<i>It's me, Margaret.</i>

1213
01:10:08,776 --> 01:10:11,946
<i>I hate Philip Leroy.</i>
<i>I hate him.</i>

1214
01:10:11,979 --> 01:10:15,282
<i>I hate Laura Danker, too!</i>
<i>With her big boobs.</i>

1215
01:10:15,315 --> 01:10:18,218
<i>"Ooh, look at me, everybody,</i>
<i>I'm wearing a sweater."</i>

1216
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:21,556
<i>I hate Nancy. That liar!</i>

1217
01:10:21,589 --> 01:10:23,290
<i>And Norman Fisher,</i>
<i>the way that he reads</i>

1218
01:10:23,323 --> 01:10:25,960
<i>with his stupid lips</i>
<i>flapping everywhere!</i>

1219
01:10:25,993 --> 01:10:30,064
<i>Please. Please, just hurry up</i>
<i>and get me to Florida!</i>

1220
01:10:38,673 --> 01:10:40,174
Philip and Norman
should be here.

1221
01:10:40,208 --> 01:10:42,543
They make us do all the work.

1222
01:10:42,577 --> 01:10:44,679
What time is your mom
picking you up?

1223
01:10:45,613 --> 01:10:46,714
Not till later.

1224
01:10:46,748 --> 01:10:48,850
I have to go to St. Thomas
for Confession first.

1225
01:10:48,883 --> 01:10:51,519
Confession?

1226
01:10:51,552 --> 01:10:53,521
It's just something you have
to do when you're Catholic.

1227
01:10:54,354 --> 01:10:55,857
What do you confess?

1228
01:10:57,658 --> 01:10:58,659
Things.

1229
01:11:00,094 --> 01:11:02,395
What kinds of things?

1230
01:11:06,634 --> 01:11:07,635
Never mind.

1231
01:11:15,877 --> 01:11:17,979
You're just copying straight
out of the <i>World Book.</i>

1232
01:11:18,713 --> 01:11:20,347
It's four words.

1233
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:22,884
"Germany invaded
Belgium when..."

1234
01:11:22,917 --> 01:11:24,284
So, you're still cheating.

1235
01:11:24,317 --> 01:11:26,187
Mr. Benedict will know
if you're cheating.

1236
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:28,823
I'm not cheating! Jeez!

1237
01:11:32,492 --> 01:11:33,928
Quit acting like
you know everything

1238
01:11:33,961 --> 01:11:35,129
and you're so great.

1239
01:11:35,163 --> 01:11:36,631
This has nothing to do
with being great.

1240
01:11:36,664 --> 01:11:38,733
I know all about the stuff
that you do.

1241
01:11:40,268 --> 01:11:41,636
What's that supposed to mean?

1242
01:11:41,669 --> 01:11:43,538
I heard about you
and Moose Freed.

1243
01:11:44,337 --> 01:11:46,007
What about me and Moose Freed?

1244
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:49,010
Oh, how you and Evan and Moose
go behind the A&P.

1245
01:11:49,043 --> 01:11:50,443
And why would I do that?

1246
01:11:50,477 --> 01:11:54,115
I don't know why you do it.
But I know why they do it.

1247
01:11:54,148 --> 01:11:56,349
So they can feel you up
or something and you let them.

1248
01:11:56,383 --> 01:11:57,752
You're a liar. You're lying!

1249
01:11:57,785 --> 01:11:58,820
I'm not lying.

1250
01:11:58,853 --> 01:11:59,954
You're just like Nancy.

1251
01:11:59,987 --> 01:12:02,824
All you do is pick on people
and make up stories.

1252
01:12:02,857 --> 01:12:04,826
You think I don't know
about you and your friends?

1253
01:12:17,337 --> 01:12:18,873
Laura!

1254
01:12:18,906 --> 01:12:21,474
Wait. Please! Laura!

1255
01:12:21,509 --> 01:12:23,878
-Wait up. Please!
-You think I don't know

1256
01:12:23,911 --> 01:12:26,180
that all of you make fun of me
like it's some kind of game?

1257
01:12:26,214 --> 01:12:27,414
-It's not me.
-Do you think I want to be

1258
01:12:27,447 --> 01:12:28,983
the biggest kid in the class?

1259
01:12:29,016 --> 01:12:32,253
How would you feel if you were
to wear a bra in fourth grade

1260
01:12:32,286 --> 01:12:33,321
and everybody called you names

1261
01:12:33,353 --> 01:12:35,022
just because of
how you looked?

1262
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:37,357
I don't know.

1263
01:12:41,662 --> 01:12:44,364
Hey, wait. I really am sorry.

1264
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:04,018
Laura?

1265
01:13:05,987 --> 01:13:07,021
Laura.

1266
01:13:23,838 --> 01:13:26,607
<i>I'm the worst person</i>
<i>who ever lived, God.</i>

1267
01:13:26,641 --> 01:13:29,543
<i>I picked on Laura Danker</i>
<i>just because I felt mean.</i>

1268
01:13:30,711 --> 01:13:33,347
<i>I don't want to be like Nancy.</i>

1269
01:13:33,381 --> 01:13:36,684
<i>I don't even know if I want to</i>
<i>be friends with her anymore.</i>

1270
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:40,988
<i>I've been</i>
<i>looking for you, God.</i>

1271
01:13:42,757 --> 01:13:45,126
<i>I looked for you in Temple,</i>

1272
01:13:45,159 --> 01:13:46,694
<i>I looked for you in Church...</i>

1273
01:13:48,229 --> 01:13:49,897
<i>I didn't feel you at all.</i>

1274
01:13:52,566 --> 01:13:54,201
<i>Why? Why, God?</i>

1275
01:13:55,836 --> 01:13:58,906
<i>Why do I only feel you</i>
<i>when I'm alone?</i>

1276
01:14:03,210 --> 01:14:05,513
Yes, my child.

1277
01:14:05,546 --> 01:14:08,082
Do you have something
you'd like to confess?

1278
01:14:10,051 --> 01:14:11,185
Um...

1279
01:14:17,358 --> 01:14:18,726
I...

1280
01:14:18,759 --> 01:14:20,995
I did something really awful.

1281
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:24,464
And...

1282
01:14:26,667 --> 01:14:28,135
I'm really sorry.

1283
01:15:00,067 --> 01:15:01,669
<i>"Dear Barbara,</i>

1284
01:15:01,702 --> 01:15:03,904
"your letter felt like
an answer to prayer.

1285
01:15:03,938 --> 01:15:06,173
"Your father and I have been
thinking about you a lot.

1286
01:15:06,207 --> 01:15:08,843
"We're getting older and
suddenly, more than anything,

1287
01:15:08,876 --> 01:15:12,813
"we'd like to see
our only daughter

1288
01:15:12,847 --> 01:15:15,516
"and finally get to know our
granddaughter, Margaret Ann."

1289
01:15:17,351 --> 01:15:18,619
"We're flying east next week,

1290
01:15:18,652 --> 01:15:20,488
"and we sincerely hope
you'll let us visit.

1291
01:15:20,521 --> 01:15:22,723
"Love, your mother,
Mary Hutchins."

1292
01:15:29,463 --> 01:15:30,898
So you sent them a card?

1293
01:15:33,334 --> 01:15:34,902
I don't know why.

1294
01:15:44,478 --> 01:15:45,646
Do you remember
what it was like

1295
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:47,314
when they just cast you out?

1296
01:15:49,083 --> 01:15:50,151
Yes.

1297
01:15:50,184 --> 01:15:51,185
Do you?

1298
01:15:52,186 --> 01:15:53,621
Because I remember.

1299
01:15:53,654 --> 01:15:54,989
I know. I know.

1300
01:15:55,823 --> 01:15:58,025
How they treated you
was just...

1301
01:15:58,926 --> 01:16:00,661
-I know.
-How they treated me?

1302
01:16:01,530 --> 01:16:03,564
They think
you're going to hell

1303
01:16:03,597 --> 01:16:05,099
because you married a Jew.

1304
01:16:06,167 --> 01:16:07,334
Think about that.

1305
01:16:08,002 --> 01:16:09,003
I...

1306
01:16:10,071 --> 01:16:11,172
I know.

1307
01:16:11,205 --> 01:16:14,675
Do you really, really want to
open up that door?

1308
01:16:15,309 --> 01:16:16,610
We have a good life.

1309
01:16:16,644 --> 01:16:18,045
Yes. Yes.

1310
01:16:19,447 --> 01:16:20,648
I...

1311
01:16:21,749 --> 01:16:26,153
But what if this means...
they've changed?

1312
01:16:29,457 --> 01:16:30,691
And if they haven't?

1313
01:16:34,495 --> 01:16:36,163
They're my parents.

1314
01:16:38,933 --> 01:16:39,967
Mmm.

1315
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,069
-The only ones I got.
-They are your parents.

1316
01:16:43,170 --> 01:16:45,272
Oh, God.

1317
01:16:45,306 --> 01:16:48,175
Oh, my goodness.

1318
01:16:48,209 --> 01:16:49,210
I'm sorry.

1319
01:16:52,746 --> 01:16:53,981
What's going on?

1320
01:16:54,014 --> 01:16:55,382
Um...

1321
01:16:55,416 --> 01:16:57,952
-Oh.
-Oh, honey, um...

1322
01:16:59,153 --> 01:17:00,287
Uh...

1323
01:17:02,189 --> 01:17:03,324
We got a letter

1324
01:17:03,357 --> 01:17:06,160
from, um, from my parents,
from your grandparents.

1325
01:17:06,193 --> 01:17:08,062
And they're coming
to visit next week.

1326
01:17:08,095 --> 01:17:10,532
- Next... next week?
- Mmm-hmm.

1327
01:17:10,565 --> 01:17:12,133
They're really
excited to meet you.

1328
01:17:12,166 --> 01:17:14,135
I won't be here.
I'll be in Florida.

1329
01:17:17,037 --> 01:17:18,973
I'm still going to Florida,
aren't I?

1330
01:17:19,006 --> 01:17:21,842
-Margaret, look...
-No. What?

1331
01:17:21,876 --> 01:17:23,978
I can't even
go to Florida now?

1332
01:17:24,011 --> 01:17:26,147
Come on, I don't even
want to see them.

1333
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:27,582
I want to see Grandma.

1334
01:17:27,616 --> 01:17:29,817
I know. I know and we will
make this up to you.

1335
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:31,819
I promise, you will go
to Florida,

1336
01:17:31,852 --> 01:17:34,021
-just another time.
-No, I don't want

1337
01:17:34,054 --> 01:17:35,956
to go to Florida another time.

1338
01:17:36,857 --> 01:17:38,527
Does Grandma know about this?

1339
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,094
No, not yet.
We have to call her.

1340
01:17:40,127 --> 01:17:42,196
Well, I'm not doing it.
You can do it yourself.

1341
01:17:42,229 --> 01:17:44,098
- No, of course. Of course.
- Let me handle that.

1342
01:17:44,131 --> 01:17:46,333
-No, I will...
-Please let me call. Please.

1343
01:17:52,173 --> 01:17:54,708
To this beautiful day.

1344
01:17:57,612 --> 01:17:59,013
Just one moment.

1345
01:17:59,813 --> 01:18:01,516
Don't eat all the cheese
without me.

1346
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:05,386
I'm just kidding.
You eat as much as you want.

1347
01:18:05,419 --> 01:18:07,054
Depending on your cholesterol.

1348
01:18:07,087 --> 01:18:09,356
I'm sure it's low.

1349
01:18:14,762 --> 01:18:15,930
Simon residence.

1350
01:18:15,963 --> 01:18:17,632
<i>Hi, Mom. Yes. Uh...</i>

1351
01:18:17,666 --> 01:18:18,999
Herb?

1352
01:18:19,033 --> 01:18:20,734
Uh, Margaret's, uh, plan
to come to Florida next week

1353
01:18:20,768 --> 01:18:21,802
isn't going to work out.

1354
01:18:21,835 --> 01:18:23,037
I'm really sorry.

1355
01:18:24,038 --> 01:18:25,706
<i>Just</i>
<i>give me the phone.</i>

1356
01:18:26,740 --> 01:18:27,841
<i>Hey, Grandma.</i>

1357
01:18:27,875 --> 01:18:30,110
Margaret, what happened?
What's going on?

1358
01:18:30,144 --> 01:18:32,046
We...

1359
01:18:32,079 --> 01:18:35,015
We got a letter that my
other grandparents are coming.

1360
01:18:35,950 --> 01:18:39,853
<i>And I just</i>
<i>really wanted to see you.</i>

1361
01:18:39,887 --> 01:18:42,022
Put your mother
on the phone right now.

1362
01:18:43,525 --> 01:18:45,292
- Oh, no...
- It's okay.

1363
01:18:47,962 --> 01:18:48,862
Sylvia.

1364
01:18:48,896 --> 01:18:50,599
What the hell
is going on, Barbara?

1365
01:18:50,632 --> 01:18:53,635
Sylvia, I'm so very sorry
about this

1366
01:18:53,668 --> 01:18:56,837
and I will try and explain it
another time.

1367
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:58,806
No. You're going to
explain right now.

1368
01:18:58,839 --> 01:19:00,441
I'm sorry, I have to...
I have to go.

1369
01:19:05,045 --> 01:19:07,381
<i>Are you there, God?</i>
<i>It's me, Margaret.</i>

1370
01:19:07,414 --> 01:19:09,984
<i>-I'm absolutely miserable.</i>
-I am so sorry.

1371
01:19:10,017 --> 01:19:12,453
<i>Everything</i>
<i>is going wrong. Everything.</i>

1372
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:14,723
<i>I'm begging you.</i>

1373
01:19:14,755 --> 01:19:17,791
<i>Make something happen</i>
<i>so that they don't come</i>

1374
01:19:17,825 --> 01:19:19,893
<i>and I can still go to Florida.</i>

1375
01:19:28,603 --> 01:19:30,271
Please, Margaret.
Even if it's fake,

1376
01:19:30,304 --> 01:19:32,406
can you just look happy?

1377
01:19:33,841 --> 01:19:35,809
Or at least not so unhappy?

1378
01:19:37,144 --> 01:19:39,179
Why do you
even want to see them?

1379
01:19:39,213 --> 01:19:41,248
After everything
that they did to you?

1380
01:19:43,183 --> 01:19:48,255
Because I want them to see
how great we've done.

1381
01:19:48,289 --> 01:19:51,559
I... And how proud
I am of our family.

1382
01:19:56,598 --> 01:19:58,232
Hey! Hello.

1383
01:19:59,266 --> 01:20:00,301
That's them.

1384
01:20:01,068 --> 01:20:02,069
Okay.

1385
01:20:04,572 --> 01:20:05,573
Hi!

1386
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:09,577
They might hug you,
I don't know.

1387
01:20:09,611 --> 01:20:11,011
Just be prepared.

1388
01:20:14,948 --> 01:20:16,116
-Hi!
-Hello!

1389
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:18,419
Hello. It's so nice
to see you.

1390
01:20:18,452 --> 01:20:20,588
Oh, you too, Barbara.

1391
01:20:22,657 --> 01:20:23,957
Oh.

1392
01:20:29,063 --> 01:20:30,964
-Hi, honey.
-Oh.

1393
01:20:34,435 --> 01:20:36,970
- This must be Margaret Ann.
- Mmm-hmm.

1394
01:20:40,074 --> 01:20:41,842
We're very glad to meet you.

1395
01:20:41,875 --> 01:20:44,411
-Yes, we are. Yes, we are.
-Me, too.

1396
01:20:45,245 --> 01:20:46,313
Um...

1397
01:20:47,481 --> 01:20:49,450
Bags! We'll get the bags.

1398
01:20:49,483 --> 01:20:53,020
Um, Herb is just out, uh,
with the car.

1399
01:20:53,053 --> 01:20:55,155
- Yeah, so... Okay.
- Okay.

1400
01:20:55,189 --> 01:20:57,491
Just out here to the right.

1401
01:20:57,525 --> 01:20:59,293
The blue car there. Yep.

1402
01:21:01,295 --> 01:21:02,797
Hey.

1403
01:21:02,831 --> 01:21:04,599
-Youse okay? Yeah?
-Yeah.

1404
01:21:04,632 --> 01:21:06,100
Mom, Dad, you remember Herb?

1405
01:21:06,133 --> 01:21:07,535
-Yeah. Hello, Herb.
-Hi.

1406
01:21:07,569 --> 01:21:08,737
-How are you?
-Okay.

1407
01:21:08,770 --> 01:21:10,471
-Hi. Nice to see you.
-Hello.

1408
01:21:11,405 --> 01:21:13,140
Um, should I...
I'll take this for you.

1409
01:21:13,173 --> 01:21:14,208
Oh.

1410
01:21:17,612 --> 01:21:18,646
All right.

1411
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:20,080
Okay.

1412
01:21:20,948 --> 01:21:22,015
All right.
Should I put these up?

1413
01:21:22,049 --> 01:21:23,484
Oh, yes. Thank you.

1414
01:21:24,885 --> 01:21:28,656
Here we are.
Make yourselves comfortable.

1415
01:21:28,690 --> 01:21:30,592
-Lovely home.
-Yeah!

1416
01:21:30,625 --> 01:21:33,160
Thank you. Yes. Uh...

1417
01:21:33,961 --> 01:21:35,697
Okay. So, uh, Margaret, uh,

1418
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:36,865
can you show them
to their room?

1419
01:21:36,897 --> 01:21:39,634
And, um, I'll just
get dinner started.

1420
01:21:39,667 --> 01:21:42,504
Sure. Um, up this way.

1421
01:21:46,306 --> 01:21:48,810
Gosh, you look
just like your mom

1422
01:21:48,843 --> 01:21:50,277
when she was your age.

1423
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:52,980
Um, yeah. This way.

1424
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:02,724
- Hi.
- Hey.

1425
01:22:02,757 --> 01:22:03,924
How are you doing?

1426
01:22:03,957 --> 01:22:06,126
Uh... How are you doing?

1427
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:08,162
Um, I used up
all my small talk

1428
01:22:08,195 --> 01:22:09,564
-in the car.
-Oh, God.

1429
01:22:09,597 --> 01:22:11,932
Do they like sports? TV shows?

1430
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:15,469
Game shows.
They used to watch game shows.

1431
01:22:15,503 --> 01:22:18,773
Okay. Game shows, game shows.

1432
01:22:18,807 --> 01:22:20,007
Hmm.

1433
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:21,643
Um, coming!

1434
01:22:24,478 --> 01:22:25,513
Herb!

1435
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:27,247
Mom!

1436
01:22:27,281 --> 01:22:29,617
Baby! Come give
your mom a big hug.

1437
01:22:29,651 --> 01:22:30,852
Oh.

1438
01:22:30,885 --> 01:22:32,687
-Oh. Look at your little face.
-Sylvia?

1439
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:34,021
Yeah. My mom is here.

1440
01:22:34,054 --> 01:22:35,422
Uh, yes, she is.
What's happening?

1441
01:22:35,456 --> 01:22:37,659
Well, Margaret said
she needed to see me,

1442
01:22:37,692 --> 01:22:38,959
so we flew out from Florida.

1443
01:22:38,992 --> 01:22:40,160
Are your parents here yet?

1444
01:22:40,194 --> 01:22:42,963
Oh. This is Morris Binamin.

1445
01:22:42,996 --> 01:22:45,032
Rhymes with cinnamon.

1446
01:22:45,065 --> 01:22:47,234
- Hi.
- Grandma!

1447
01:22:47,267 --> 01:22:50,170
There's my Margaret!
Oh!

1448
01:22:50,204 --> 01:22:52,172
- Did you know?
- I had no... I know.

1449
01:22:52,206 --> 01:22:53,407
I missed you so much!

1450
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:54,909
I thought
you were in Florida.

1451
01:22:54,943 --> 01:22:56,778
I know. Well,
Florida came to you.

1452
01:22:56,811 --> 01:22:58,111
Uh...

1453
01:22:58,145 --> 01:23:01,516
Mom, Dad, this is Sylvia.
Herb's mom.

1454
01:23:01,549 --> 01:23:05,687
Sylvia, this... These are
my parents, Paul and Mary.

1455
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:07,221
Hello.

1456
01:23:07,254 --> 01:23:09,122
Hello.

1457
01:23:11,726 --> 01:23:12,794
We have pot roast.

1458
01:23:12,827 --> 01:23:14,428
Sure.

1459
01:23:17,097 --> 01:23:18,499
Mmm.

1460
01:23:19,734 --> 01:23:21,034
- Mmm.
- Oh, yeah.

1461
01:23:21,068 --> 01:23:23,237
-Dinner is delicious, Barbara.
-Oh, my God, yes.

1462
01:23:23,270 --> 01:23:26,073
-Oh.
-You have definitely improved.

1463
01:23:26,106 --> 01:23:28,375
- It is very nice.
- Thank you.

1464
01:23:30,277 --> 01:23:35,215
Well, I have to admit
it was a bit of a jolt, um,

1465
01:23:35,249 --> 01:23:39,453
but it's nice to have
everyone here together.

1466
01:23:39,486 --> 01:23:41,088
The whole family.

1467
01:23:43,323 --> 01:23:45,827
And Mr. Binamin.

1468
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:47,461
Nice to have you, too.

1469
01:23:50,230 --> 01:23:52,132
<i>-L'chaim.</i>
<i>-L'chaim.</i>

1470
01:23:53,801 --> 01:23:57,204
<i>L'chaim. L'chaim.</i>

1471
01:23:57,237 --> 01:24:00,207
<i>L'chaim. L'chaim. L'chaim.</i>
<i>L'chaim. L'chaim.</i>

1472
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:02,376
To life!

1473
01:24:09,082 --> 01:24:10,618
So, um,
do you watch <i>Jeopardy!?</i>

1474
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:17,959
I used to braid
your mama's hair

1475
01:24:17,992 --> 01:24:19,092
when she was a little girl.

1476
01:24:19,126 --> 01:24:21,029
Did your mom
ever braid your hair?

1477
01:24:21,094 --> 01:24:23,565
Um, yeah, she used to do it
all the time.

1478
01:24:23,598 --> 01:24:26,634
I can see she taught you how
to braid with your bracelet.

1479
01:24:26,668 --> 01:24:27,735
Yeah.

1480
01:24:27,769 --> 01:24:29,037
Oh, there's just so much

1481
01:24:29,069 --> 01:24:30,505
we want to get to know
about you, Margaret.

1482
01:24:30,538 --> 01:24:32,540
Twelve years is a lot
to catch up on.

1483
01:24:32,574 --> 01:24:33,741
Yeah. A long time.

1484
01:24:34,441 --> 01:24:37,077
So, uh, we were wondering...

1485
01:24:38,445 --> 01:24:40,180
Do you go to Sunday school?

1486
01:24:40,213 --> 01:24:42,617
Or, uh, have you ever
thought about it?

1487
01:24:43,518 --> 01:24:46,988
-Uh...
-Nope. Never. Not once.

1488
01:24:47,021 --> 01:24:49,624
We asked Margaret
the question, Sylvia.

1489
01:24:49,657 --> 01:24:50,692
Margaret?

1490
01:24:50,725 --> 01:24:51,859
Well, you're wasting your time

1491
01:24:51,893 --> 01:24:55,029
because Margaret went
to Temple and she's Jewish.

1492
01:24:55,063 --> 01:24:56,831
What did you say?

1493
01:24:56,864 --> 01:24:57,899
Excuse me.

1494
01:24:57,932 --> 01:24:59,266
Margaret went to Temple.

1495
01:24:59,299 --> 01:25:00,768
-Okay, Mom, you're done.
-What are you talking about?

1496
01:25:00,802 --> 01:25:02,837
Okay, that's it.
Well,
you left the room

1497
01:25:02,870 --> 01:25:04,471
and they're
trying to convert her.

1498
01:25:04,505 --> 01:25:05,940
Well, Margaret has the right
to be baptized

1499
01:25:05,974 --> 01:25:07,075
if she wants to be.

1500
01:25:07,107 --> 01:25:09,043
- Baptized?
- If she wants to be.

1501
01:25:09,077 --> 01:25:10,277
I can't believe this.

1502
01:25:11,445 --> 01:25:12,747
I can't believe
you're doing this.

1503
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:14,616
All right. Everyone,
this discussion is over.

1504
01:25:14,649 --> 01:25:16,618
We're her parents
and this discussion is over.

1505
01:25:16,651 --> 01:25:18,920
Yeah, you're right, it's over,
because she's already Jewish.

1506
01:25:18,953 --> 01:25:20,454
-Sylvia!
-Well, in our eyes,

1507
01:25:20,487 --> 01:25:24,092
-she's Christian.
-No, no! Margaret is nothing!

1508
01:25:24,124 --> 01:25:27,194
Margaret is
not Jewish or Christian.

1509
01:25:27,227 --> 01:25:30,098
She is no religion
until she decides.

1510
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:31,231
Well, how can she be Jewish

1511
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:32,767
-if her mother is Christian?
-Stop.

1512
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,669
You were never there for her.
You abandoned her.

1513
01:25:34,702 --> 01:25:35,536
What does it matter?

1514
01:25:35,570 --> 01:25:37,137
Do you think
that we wanted this?

1515
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:41,475
Stop it!

1516
01:25:42,777 --> 01:25:44,311
All of you, just stop it.

1517
01:25:44,344 --> 01:25:47,180
I don't care.
I don't care anymore.

1518
01:25:47,214 --> 01:25:49,651
It's all just
so stupid, religion!

1519
01:25:49,684 --> 01:25:50,918
Just stop fighting!

1520
01:25:50,952 --> 01:25:52,920
I... I don't want a religion.

1521
01:25:52,954 --> 01:25:55,590
- I don't care. I don't care!
- Margaret...

1522
01:25:56,758 --> 01:25:58,726
I don't even believe in God!

1523
01:26:06,734 --> 01:26:08,803
Are you happy? Hmm?

1524
01:26:10,672 --> 01:26:12,707
-I'm so sorry. I did this.
-No, no, no. This is not...

1525
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:14,307
-I am so sorry.
-No, this is not your fault.

1526
01:26:14,341 --> 01:26:17,210
This is not your fault.
Okay, this is not your fault.

1527
01:26:17,244 --> 01:26:20,014
No, that was everybody else.
That was not...

1528
01:26:20,048 --> 01:26:21,916
-Me.
-No, no, no.

1529
01:26:24,852 --> 01:26:26,521
<i>"Dear Mr. Benedict,</i>

- Hey.
- Hey.

1546
01:29:14,387 --> 01:29:16,356
Wait. Come here.

1547
01:29:17,658 --> 01:29:19,827
I don't really
feel like talking.

1548
01:29:21,095 --> 01:29:22,663
Yeah. I don't either.

1549
01:29:24,165 --> 01:29:29,637
But, um, I do want to say
sorry for how things went.

1550
01:29:31,873 --> 01:29:36,077
And I know that this past year
has not been easy.

1551
01:29:41,315 --> 01:29:43,084
Want to just sit for a minute?

1552
01:29:57,632 --> 01:30:01,068
Mmm, yeah. Good idea.

1553
01:30:13,581 --> 01:30:17,151
It gets tiring trying so hard
all the time, doesn't it?

1554
01:30:19,186 --> 01:30:20,453
Yeah.

1555
01:30:55,623 --> 01:30:59,293
- One, two, three. Cheese!
- Cheese!

1556
01:30:59,327 --> 01:31:02,830
Junior High! Whoo!

1557
01:31:02,863 --> 01:31:05,766
Come on, everybody.
Margaret, come on!

1558
01:31:10,438 --> 01:31:11,639
Hey.

1559
01:31:14,108 --> 01:31:15,209
Thanks, Mr. Benedict.

1560
01:31:16,243 --> 01:31:18,412
You're a really good teacher.

1561
01:31:18,446 --> 01:31:20,448
Well, I wouldn't say all that.
You know,

1562
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,783
still trying to iron out
some of the kinks.

1563
01:31:22,817 --> 01:31:24,785
No, you were really good.

1564
01:31:26,486 --> 01:31:27,888
I'm glad you felt that way.

1565
01:31:45,473 --> 01:31:46,674
Hey.

1566
01:31:49,543 --> 01:31:51,012
Do you want to come dance?

1567
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:54,615
Really?

1568
01:31:55,349 --> 01:31:56,550
Yeah.

1569
01:32:09,563 --> 01:32:11,132
Yes! I knew it!

1570
01:32:11,165 --> 01:32:12,466
You basically already won.

1571
01:32:12,501 --> 01:32:14,402
You've been going
for ages.

1572
01:32:14,435 --> 01:32:16,670
- Ages, Gretchen?
- Can I please go?

1573
01:32:16,704 --> 01:32:18,906
Gretchen, quit
complaining all the time.

1574
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:21,008
I'm not complaining.

1575
01:32:26,180 --> 01:32:27,314
Nancy.

1576
01:32:28,482 --> 01:32:29,817
Come on, please?

1577
01:32:35,623 --> 01:32:36,857
I got it!

1578
01:32:52,373 --> 01:32:54,842
Really nice work
on the shading, Daniel.

1579
01:32:54,875 --> 01:32:55,776
Thank you.

1580
01:32:55,810 --> 01:32:57,812
I think maybe you could
put a wash here

1581
01:32:57,845 --> 01:33:01,816
just to blend that, but I...
It's beautiful.

1582
01:33:07,455 --> 01:33:09,990
-Oh. Hey, Barbara!
-Jan!

1583
01:33:10,024 --> 01:33:12,426
It's so funny to see you.
I was just gonna call you.

1584
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:14,228
-Oh.
-Can you believe it,

1585
01:33:14,261 --> 01:33:15,530
about the stars?

1586
01:33:15,564 --> 01:33:17,164
-Oh, I know.
-Jeez.

1587
01:33:17,198 --> 01:33:20,067
Well, I guess everything
is a fire hazard these days.

1588
01:33:21,469 --> 01:33:22,837
Anyway, um,

1589
01:33:22,870 --> 01:33:24,205
we're getting
committees together

1590
01:33:24,238 --> 01:33:25,473
over at the Junior High

1591
01:33:25,507 --> 01:33:26,874
and I can think of
at least three

1592
01:33:26,907 --> 01:33:28,676
that you'd be perfect for.

1593
01:33:28,709 --> 01:33:34,782
Oh, Jan, that sounds great
and I'd love to, but, um...

1594
01:33:36,617 --> 01:33:38,085
I don't want to.

1595
01:33:40,421 --> 01:33:42,524
But thank you for asking me.

1596
01:33:42,557 --> 01:33:45,126
-Yeah.
-And, uh...

1597
01:33:46,227 --> 01:33:47,962
-Have a good day!
-Okay.

1598
01:33:52,666 --> 01:33:54,068
<i>I'm going to write you</i>
<i>so many letters.</i>

1599
01:33:54,101 --> 01:33:56,670
So many letters,
the mailman's going to say,

1600
01:33:56,704 --> 01:33:58,706
"That's it! No more!"

1601
01:33:58,739 --> 01:34:00,542
Okay.

1602
01:34:00,575 --> 01:34:02,676
<i>Oh. Have the best time, honey.</i>

1603
01:34:02,710 --> 01:34:03,844
<i>We'll see you</i>
<i>when you get back.</i>

1604
01:34:03,878 --> 01:34:05,146
See you soon, sweetie.

1605
01:34:05,179 --> 01:34:06,447
-Have fun.
-Bye.

1606
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:07,915
Love you. Bye!

1607
01:34:10,585 --> 01:34:12,853
-Okay. I think this is it.
-Got it?

1608
01:34:12,887 --> 01:34:14,655
- Then we just have to...
- Wait, wait, wait.

1609
01:34:14,688 --> 01:34:15,890
-...close it.
-Yeah.

1610
01:34:15,923 --> 01:34:17,758
- Camera, camera, camera.
- Oh, wait.

1611
01:34:17,791 --> 01:34:19,126
- Yes.
- All right.

1612
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:21,228
Okay. Now, we just
have to close it.

1613
01:34:21,262 --> 01:34:22,830
- Sides. Check the sides.
- Okay, got it?

1614
01:34:22,863 --> 01:34:24,131
- Yeah, yeah. Step on it.
- Ready. Go.

1615
01:34:24,165 --> 01:34:26,667
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

1616
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:27,902
Whoo. Ah.

1617
01:34:27,935 --> 01:34:29,904
- Just kidding.
- Every time.

1618
01:34:29,937 --> 01:34:31,138
If it's there, I'll take it.

1619
01:34:31,172 --> 01:34:32,773
- Okay.
Good stuff.
There it is.

1620
01:34:32,806 --> 01:34:34,675
Almost like
we've done it before.

1621
01:34:34,708 --> 01:34:37,178
Yeah.

1622
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,282
Is it lawn day?

1623
01:34:43,184 --> 01:34:44,185
It is.

1624
01:34:46,687 --> 01:34:48,322
- We haven't paid him yet.
- We haven't.

1625
01:34:48,355 --> 01:34:50,424
No. And if you wanted to go
into the kitchen

1626
01:34:50,457 --> 01:34:51,725
and grab it...

1627
01:34:53,127 --> 01:34:56,063
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

1628
01:35:05,272 --> 01:35:06,541
Hey. Hey, Moose.

1629
01:35:09,376 --> 01:35:10,579
Here. Dad says thanks.

1630
01:35:10,612 --> 01:35:11,912
Oh, thank you. Yeah.

1631
01:35:11,946 --> 01:35:14,481
Uh, well, have a good summer.

1632
01:35:14,516 --> 01:35:16,183
I won't be seeing you
for a while.

1633
01:35:16,217 --> 01:35:17,751
Oh, where you going?

1634
01:35:17,785 --> 01:35:20,354
Camp. New Hampshire. Yeah.

1635
01:35:20,387 --> 01:35:22,223
-Oh.
-Leaving today.

1636
01:35:22,256 --> 01:35:23,457
Well, have fun.

1637
01:35:25,192 --> 01:35:26,193
Thanks.

1638
01:35:27,461 --> 01:35:28,896
And, uh, I don't know.

1639
01:35:28,929 --> 01:35:31,065
Maybe we can hang out
when you get back?

1640
01:35:32,266 --> 01:35:33,968
Re... Really?

1641
01:35:35,002 --> 01:35:36,003
Yeah.

1642
01:35:37,938 --> 01:35:40,174
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1643
01:36:18,580 --> 01:36:20,047
Oh, my God.

1644
01:36:20,848 --> 01:36:22,517
Oh, my God.

1645
01:36:22,550 --> 01:36:24,251
Mom... Mom?

1646
01:36:25,386 --> 01:36:27,421
Mom! Mom!

1647
01:36:27,454 --> 01:36:29,223
What is it? What's wrong?

1648
01:36:29,256 --> 01:36:32,893
I got it.
I got my period.

1649
01:36:33,494 --> 01:36:34,862
What?

1650
01:36:37,898 --> 01:36:40,000
-I got it, right?
-Yeah!

1651
01:36:40,801 --> 01:36:43,404
Yeah. Yes.

1652
01:36:43,437 --> 01:36:46,840
Oh, my God.

1653
01:36:51,145 --> 01:36:53,515
I don't know why I'm crying.

1654
01:36:53,548 --> 01:36:55,717
Oh, my goodness. Wow.

1655
01:36:55,750 --> 01:36:57,885
-Are you okay? Yeah?
-I'm fine. I'm fine.

1656
01:36:57,918 --> 01:37:00,054
-You feel...
-Yep, I'm fine.

1657
01:37:00,087 --> 01:37:01,922
Do you have any cramping or...

1658
01:37:01,955 --> 01:37:03,891
-No. No, no, no. No, I'm fine.
-No?

1659
01:37:03,924 --> 01:37:05,527
I can't believe
this is happening to you.

1660
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:06,661
I don't believe it either.

1661
01:37:06,695 --> 01:37:08,295
You're a woman!

1662
01:37:08,329 --> 01:37:09,496
I'm a woman!

1663
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:15,436
Okay, um...
Get down to business.

1664
01:37:15,469 --> 01:37:16,504
-We need pads.
-Yeah.

1665
01:37:16,538 --> 01:37:17,672
-Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.

1666
01:37:17,706 --> 01:37:18,906
I actually bought you some.

1667
01:37:18,939 --> 01:37:20,174
-Really?
-I was going to sneak them

1668
01:37:20,207 --> 01:37:22,443
into your trunk at camp,
you know, just in case.

1669
01:37:22,476 --> 01:37:24,278
But, okay. One sec.

1670
01:37:25,446 --> 01:37:26,548
Be right there.

1671
01:37:28,349 --> 01:37:29,483
Okay. So...

1672
01:37:30,819 --> 01:37:32,853
Um, this is how they work.

1673
01:37:32,886 --> 01:37:34,421
-So you just put...
-I know how to do it.

1674
01:37:34,455 --> 01:37:36,558
I've been practicing
in my room for two months.

1675
01:37:36,591 --> 01:37:39,993
- What?
- Yeah.

1676
01:37:40,027 --> 01:37:42,029
-You have? Oh, my...
-Yes. Yes.

1677
01:37:44,465 --> 01:37:45,499
All right.

1678
01:37:45,533 --> 01:37:48,636
Well, then, you're, um...
You don't need me.

1679
01:37:51,205 --> 01:37:52,473
Yeah.

1680
01:37:52,507 --> 01:37:54,375
I'll be right out here. Okay.

1681
01:38:31,145 --> 01:38:33,080
<i>Are you</i>
<i>still there, God?</i>

1682
01:38:33,715 --> 01:38:35,583
<i>It's me, Margaret.</i>

1683
01:38:37,585 --> 01:38:38,653
<i>Thanks.</i>

1684
01:38:39,453 --> 01:38:41,054
<i>Thanks an awful lot.</i>
