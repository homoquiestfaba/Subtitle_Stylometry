1
00:04:20,455 --> 00:04:23,455
There's the limo.

2
00:04:27,929 --> 00:04:29,897
Code red.
Code red.

3
00:04:29,898 --> 00:04:31,465
Sir, there may
be an assassin in the building.

4
00:04:31,466 --> 00:04:33,300
We're gonna
take you out the back entrance.

5
00:04:33,301 --> 00:04:36,301
This way, Senator.

6
00:04:37,739 --> 00:04:40,739
Detective Willis, I've got orders
to disarm and detain you.

7
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,310
Sure.

8
00:04:47,716 --> 00:04:50,217
Gunshot! Gunshot!
Up on the mezzanine!

9
00:04:50,218 --> 00:04:51,418
- Move it.
- Up here.

10
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,320
Upstairs.
Come on.

11
00:04:53,321 --> 00:04:56,321
Get outta here, now!

12
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,460
All right, in here.
Move it! Move!

13
00:05:01,763 --> 00:05:04,763
Back against the wall, now!

14
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,600
It's right around the right.

15
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:12,070
- Right down there.
- Man down.

16
00:05:16,278 --> 00:05:19,278
Freeze!

17
00:05:26,121 --> 00:05:29,121
Cliff!

18
00:06:18,506 --> 00:06:21,506
Cliff!

19
00:06:36,858 --> 00:06:39,493
Let's go! Let's go!

20
00:06:39,494 --> 00:06:42,494
No, no, no,
the other door.

21
00:06:43,031 --> 00:06:46,031
Freeze!
Drop it!

22
00:06:49,471 --> 00:06:52,471
Both of you,
in the closet, now!

23
00:07:03,618 --> 00:07:06,618
Who are you?

24
00:07:07,956 --> 00:07:10,956
Who are you, goddamn it?!

25
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,060
What do you want?!

26
00:07:21,403 --> 00:07:24,403
Clear this area.

27
00:07:24,873 --> 00:07:27,873
Lock it down, lock it down.

28
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,278
Hey!
Out of the way.

29
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,346
All right, everybody move.

30
00:07:32,347 --> 00:07:34,882
Right through here.
Right through here.

31
00:07:34,883 --> 00:07:37,883
No pulse.
He's dead.

32
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,926
Make sure
it's clear down there.

33
00:07:45,927 --> 00:07:48,195
Is the elevator clear?
Is it clear? Get back to me.

34
00:07:48,196 --> 00:07:50,464
- Come on, keep moving.
- Uniform, seal this off.

35
00:07:50,465 --> 00:07:53,465
Yeah, check -- check down there.

36
00:07:54,135 --> 00:07:55,903
- Let's go, sir.
- Let's go, come on.

37
00:07:55,904 --> 00:07:58,672
This way, Senator.

38
00:07:58,673 --> 00:08:00,007
Yes.

39
00:08:00,008 --> 00:08:01,542
Has any motive been established

40
00:08:01,543 --> 00:08:04,543
as to why Detective Willis
would want to assassinate Senator Holt?

41
00:08:05,046 --> 00:08:08,046
Lieutenant Flynn.

42
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:10,284
The depart --

43
00:08:10,285 --> 00:08:13,020
The department is conducting
an investigation,

44
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:15,856
but at this time
we have no motive.

45
00:08:15,857 --> 00:08:17,357
Lieutenant, Lieutenant.

46
00:08:17,358 --> 00:08:19,359
Yes, sir.

47
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,360
Senator, do you still intend
to run for President?

48
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:29,601
I want to be President.

49
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,481
- Gallagher, FBI.
- Mm-hmm.

50
00:08:40,482 --> 00:08:43,482
- What's in the bag?
- Security equipment.

51
00:08:43,651 --> 00:08:46,651
Open it up.

52
00:08:48,289 --> 00:08:50,190
Hey! Hey!
Freeze, right now!

53
00:08:50,191 --> 00:08:53,191
- Hold it! Hold it!
- Shoot him.

54
00:09:03,204 --> 00:09:06,204
Senator, get down.

55
00:09:20,522 --> 00:09:23,090
Senator!

56
00:09:23,091 --> 00:09:26,091
Stop him!

57
00:09:48,183 --> 00:09:51,183
Look!

58
00:10:14,909 --> 00:10:17,909
Are you all right?

59
00:10:30,491 --> 00:10:33,491
All right, let's go.

60
00:10:44,439 --> 00:10:47,439
As you can see here, there was a fire
reported at the ballroom here,

61
00:10:48,476 --> 00:10:50,777
and, oh, we have to
move for the gurney here.

62
00:10:50,778 --> 00:10:53,580
A very, very busy
crime scene here,

63
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:56,581
and, uh, we'll be right back
with more, uh, right after this ...

64
00:10:57,886 --> 00:10:59,686
Well, were you here
when this happened?

65
00:10:59,687 --> 00:11:02,687
- I need a couple pictures out here, Jack.
- Uh, back to you, Jim.

66
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,470
Oh!

67
00:14:40,608 --> 00:14:43,608
Mom, please take her
out of here, please.

68
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,215
Nurse!

69
00:14:48,216 --> 00:14:51,216
Get a gurney,
get an orderly, stat.

70
00:15:02,196 --> 00:15:05,196
Hi.

71
00:15:12,473 --> 00:15:15,473
Hi.

72
00:15:18,846 --> 00:15:21,846
Come here, honey.
Come on, honey.

73
00:15:43,771 --> 00:15:46,771
My God.
What have I become?

74
00:16:23,544 --> 00:16:24,744
I'm telling you, man.

75
00:16:24,745 --> 00:16:27,745
This place is completely
fucking outrageous.

76
00:16:28,182 --> 00:16:30,283
It's -- it's outrageous, man.
Come on, check it out.

77
00:16:30,284 --> 00:16:31,952
- Looks pretty wild.
- It is, man.

78
00:16:31,953 --> 00:16:33,153
- It's big, huh?
- Yeah.

79
00:16:33,154 --> 00:16:35,589
Yeah, a pretty large place.

80
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,690
I'm telling you, man.

81
00:16:36,691 --> 00:16:39,459
This is gonna be a rave
they're gonna be talking about for years --

82
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,460
the underground of undergrounds,
a party to end all parties.

83
00:16:48,202 --> 00:16:50,170
- Whoa.
- Come on, guys.

84
00:16:50,171 --> 00:16:52,505
- Hey.
- Whoo!

85
00:16:52,506 --> 00:16:55,242
- Look at these ceilings.
- Yeah.

86
00:16:55,243 --> 00:16:58,243
All right!

87
00:17:03,951 --> 00:17:06,951
Look at that.

88
00:17:08,022 --> 00:17:11,022
We could
burn this place down, man.

89
00:17:16,464 --> 00:17:19,464
Far fuckin' out.

90
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:22,667
This way, man, over here.
Come on, check it out.

91
00:17:31,078 --> 00:17:34,078
You got the main hall upstairs,
then you got this level.

92
00:17:35,216 --> 00:17:38,216
People could just chill.

93
00:17:39,353 --> 00:17:42,353
Maybe we could
put a bar down here, man.

94
00:17:43,491 --> 00:17:45,558
Hey, there's more down below.

95
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:48,559
I'm telling you, man,
this place just goes on and on.

96
00:17:50,164 --> 00:17:53,164
Whoo!

97
00:17:54,635 --> 00:17:57,635
People can just explore.

98
00:18:00,975 --> 00:18:03,943
I want to call it
"Bad to the Max."

99
00:18:03,944 --> 00:18:06,579
I like it.

100
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,915
It's got potential.

101
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,916
It's got a lot of potential.

102
00:18:13,521 --> 00:18:16,521
Let's get outta here.
We've got a rave to promote.

103
00:18:22,229 --> 00:18:25,229
Yes.

104
00:18:35,643 --> 00:18:38,643
This place is fucking great.

105
00:18:42,216 --> 00:18:45,216
You're a fucking genius, Stanton.

106
00:18:46,554 --> 00:18:49,554
Do you hear that?

107
00:18:54,128 --> 00:18:57,128
You're fucking out of this world.

108
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:02,166
Yes ...
I am at that.

109
00:19:04,071 --> 00:19:07,071
You coming, or what?

110
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:10,208
Later.

111
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,690
Yo, what the hell
you think you're doing?

112
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:02,894
- These are car keys.
- Yeah, what's it to you?

113
00:20:03,497 --> 00:20:05,632
- I like cars.
- Yeah?

114
00:20:05,633 --> 00:20:08,633
I like cars, too.
Now, get lost, okay?

115
00:20:10,504 --> 00:20:12,305
What the ...

116
00:20:12,306 --> 00:20:15,306
Hey, man,
you want it, take it!

117
00:20:18,078 --> 00:20:21,078
J-Jesus, it's only
a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

118
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,220
- Let's just leave, okay?
- Uh, yeah.

119
00:20:32,126 --> 00:20:35,126
Hmm.

120
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,301
- Mmm.
- What the hell's going on here?

121
00:20:41,302 --> 00:20:42,836
Hmm.

122
00:20:42,837 --> 00:20:44,904
Look, man, I'm going to
have to ask you to leave.

123
00:20:44,905 --> 00:20:47,905
You don't,
and I'm calling the cops.

124
00:20:48,742 --> 00:20:50,577
Can't you see I'm eating?

125
00:20:50,578 --> 00:20:53,578
Eat this, asshole.

126
00:20:55,683 --> 00:20:58,683
Don't ever, ever bother me
while I'm eating.

127
00:21:14,702 --> 00:21:16,536
I like this.

128
00:21:16,537 --> 00:21:19,537
"Stun gun --
give 'em a jolt they'll never forget."

129
00:21:20,808 --> 00:21:23,808
I like this a lot.

130
00:21:32,586 --> 00:21:35,586
Oh.

131
00:21:37,691 --> 00:21:40,560
Oh, I want this car.

132
00:21:40,561 --> 00:21:42,061
Are you the valet?

133
00:21:42,062 --> 00:21:45,062
- I like this car.
- Yeah, kid, I don't blame you.

134
00:21:45,232 --> 00:21:48,232
Look, uh, take this,
put this towards a down payment.

135
00:21:49,803 --> 00:21:52,803
And send me over a valet,
will you, please?

136
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,308
But I want this car.

137
00:21:55,309 --> 00:21:57,944
He wants this car.

138
00:21:57,945 --> 00:22:00,945
- And I want the girl.
- Oh, he wants ...

139
00:22:01,749 --> 00:22:03,149
What are ...

140
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:06,150
Hey, stop that.

141
00:22:07,121 --> 00:22:09,589
Hey, what are you ...

142
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:12,590
Stop!
Let me out! Let me out!

143
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:16,863
Along with his stolen Corvette,

144
00:22:16,864 --> 00:22:19,864
the fiancÃ©e ofnoted industrialist
William Brockhurst, Jr.,

145
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,402
was found dead
at the old Grayson Steel Mill

146
00:22:22,403 --> 00:22:24,370
after being abducted
earlier this evening.

147
00:22:24,371 --> 00:22:26,606
It is believed that the suspect
may have been involved

148
00:22:26,607 --> 00:22:29,607
in several other brutal incidents
in the vicinity earlier today.

149
00:23:46,253 --> 00:23:49,253
You can go for them or me,
not both.

150
00:23:52,493 --> 00:23:55,493
One or the other, motherfucker.
One or the other!

151
00:24:42,943 --> 00:24:45,411
Gotta go. Bye.

152
00:24:45,412 --> 00:24:47,246
I've already sent for backup.

153
00:24:47,247 --> 00:24:50,247
It didn't help last time.
You lose, sucker.

154
00:25:09,937 --> 00:25:12,937
Wrong, motherfucker,
you lose.

155
00:25:27,755 --> 00:25:30,755
Here's your father,
Police Detective Thomas Beck.

156
00:25:30,924 --> 00:25:33,924
They, uh, found him
by the old Grayson Steel Mill.

157
00:25:34,461 --> 00:25:37,196
It seems like he'd
been in one heck of a fight.

158
00:25:37,197 --> 00:25:40,166
I gotta tell you,
we see a lot of weird things,

159
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:43,167
but this was pretty strange
for such an old man.

160
00:25:44,104 --> 00:25:47,104
My father wasn't old.

161
00:25:48,776 --> 00:25:51,776
Well, somebody
should've told him that.

162
00:25:56,216 --> 00:25:58,651
That's not my father.

163
00:25:58,652 --> 00:26:01,454
Look, I just work here.

164
00:26:01,455 --> 00:26:04,323
I'm telling you, that's not him.

165
00:26:04,324 --> 00:26:07,324
I hadn't seen him in a couple of years,
but he was only 48.

166
00:26:09,797 --> 00:26:12,365
You don't believe me?

167
00:26:12,366 --> 00:26:15,366
Look.

168
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:19,370
Listen, lady, all I know
is dental records don't lie.

169
00:26:22,409 --> 00:26:24,310
Excuse me?

170
00:26:24,311 --> 00:26:26,379
Well, he came in as a John Doe.

171
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:29,380
They used dental records to, uh,
make positive ID.

172
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,720
I'm sorry.

173
00:26:38,425 --> 00:26:41,425
I'll, uh, give you
a few minutes alone.

174
00:26:54,341 --> 00:26:57,341
What happened to you?

175
00:26:58,745 --> 00:27:01,745
Goddamn it,
what happened to you?

176
00:28:06,947 --> 00:28:09,715
Don't!

177
00:28:09,716 --> 00:28:11,484
No.

178
00:28:11,485 --> 00:28:13,219
Okay.
Okay, okay, please.

179
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,220
Please, I'll do anything you want,
just don't hurt me, please.

180
00:28:20,928 --> 00:28:23,928
Sit.

181
00:28:47,187 --> 00:28:49,722
Cut yourself.

182
00:28:49,723 --> 00:28:50,890
Huh?

183
00:28:50,891 --> 00:28:53,891
You heard me ...
cut yourself.

184
00:28:58,065 --> 00:29:01,065
You gotta be kidding.

185
00:29:01,368 --> 00:29:04,368
Not kidding.

186
00:29:04,738 --> 00:29:07,707
Small, on the finger.

187
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:10,708
Just enough to draw blood.

188
00:29:11,945 --> 00:29:14,945
Do it!

189
00:29:25,325 --> 00:29:27,960
The knife.

190
00:29:27,961 --> 00:29:30,961
Slowly.

191
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:39,770
The other hand,
hold it out.

192
00:29:54,454 --> 00:29:57,454
I thought you were
one of them, I'm sorry.

193
00:29:57,991 --> 00:30:00,059
One of "them"?

194
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,628
One of them.

195
00:30:02,629 --> 00:30:05,629
Or one of us.

196
00:30:05,932 --> 00:30:08,932
What do you mean?

197
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:12,269
I suppose it was
hidden from you all these years.

198
00:30:12,873 --> 00:30:14,940
Hidden? What?

199
00:30:14,941 --> 00:30:17,877
The truth ...

200
00:30:17,878 --> 00:30:20,878
... about your father.

201
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:26,083
Get dressed.

202
00:30:26,253 --> 00:30:29,253
Now.

203
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:33,690
My clothes are in there.

204
00:30:42,569 --> 00:30:45,569
I'll be right outside this door.

205
00:30:48,341 --> 00:30:51,341
What about my father was hidden?

206
00:30:51,545 --> 00:30:54,545
That he was not of this planet.

207
00:30:55,382 --> 00:30:58,382
Right. And I suppose
you're an alien, too?

208
00:30:58,652 --> 00:31:01,353
Yes.

209
00:31:01,354 --> 00:31:03,889
Great, this is just great.

210
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:06,492
The message we received
was garbled and unintelligible,

211
00:31:06,493 --> 00:31:09,493
but what we did get indicated
there might have been a spawning.

212
00:31:11,298 --> 00:31:13,799
A spawning?

213
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,800
That and the name of your father,
Thomas Beck.

214
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:19,405
We tried.

215
00:31:19,406 --> 00:31:22,406
There was nothing more we could
decipher from the message.

216
00:31:22,843 --> 00:31:25,843
The trail dead-ends with him.

217
00:31:28,515 --> 00:31:31,515
I got here too late.

218
00:31:32,686 --> 00:31:35,187
Look, what exactly
is it that you want with me?

219
00:31:35,188 --> 00:31:38,188
- Your help.
- My help?

220
00:31:38,358 --> 00:31:41,358
You have a very peculiar way
of asking for someone's help.

221
00:31:41,394 --> 00:31:43,796
Well, I'm sorry about before.
I did what I had to do.

222
00:31:43,797 --> 00:31:46,332
But I meant you no harm.

223
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:48,334
Right.

224
00:31:48,335 --> 00:31:51,335
Look, the fact that you need help
is very clear.

225
00:31:51,571 --> 00:31:53,606
And I'd really like to help you.

226
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:56,041
Good.
Let's get started, then.

227
00:31:56,042 --> 00:31:58,444
No.

228
00:31:58,445 --> 00:32:01,445
You see, what you need
is psychological help.

229
00:32:05,418 --> 00:32:08,418
You don't believe
a word I said, do you?

230
00:32:14,194 --> 00:32:16,862
You are one mixed-up,
complex human being.

231
00:32:16,863 --> 00:32:19,863
Get back.

232
00:33:42,082 --> 00:33:45,082
Now do you believe me?

233
00:33:50,457 --> 00:33:52,591
Your body ...

234
00:33:52,592 --> 00:33:55,592
where did you ...
I mean, how did you ...

235
00:33:56,763 --> 00:33:59,763
The life force
had already departed.

236
00:33:59,899 --> 00:34:02,768
You mean ... dead?

237
00:34:02,769 --> 00:34:05,037
Not dead.

238
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:08,038
Not alive.
Sort of like a machine left running,

239
00:34:09,442 --> 00:34:12,311
but that which you call the soul
had already left.

240
00:34:12,312 --> 00:34:15,312
This body
was no longer important to it.

241
00:34:15,315 --> 00:34:17,783
This is too weird.

242
00:34:17,784 --> 00:34:20,784
I have to find
the ones who came before me.

243
00:34:20,887 --> 00:34:23,722
Especially the one named Rautus.

244
00:34:23,723 --> 00:34:25,524
Rautus.

245
00:34:25,525 --> 00:34:28,525
It butchered
countless of my people.

246
00:34:29,296 --> 00:34:32,296
Who knows
what it might have done here.

247
00:34:32,499 --> 00:34:34,767
It?

248
00:34:34,768 --> 00:34:37,768
The closest concept you have,
you people, is of evil incarnate.

249
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:43,740
Less than a man,
but more than an animal.

250
00:34:44,177 --> 00:34:47,177
His kind, they kill for pleasure,
take indiscriminately.

251
00:34:50,784 --> 00:34:53,784
Our fear is that
it might have spawned.

252
00:34:57,691 --> 00:35:00,691
Let's hope that it hasn't.

253
00:35:04,464 --> 00:35:07,464
- Your father?
- Yeah.

254
00:35:09,235 --> 00:35:12,235
Then after my, uh, mom died,
he withdrew, lived like a hermit.

255
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:18,310
I hadn't seen him
in a couple of years.

256
00:35:18,311 --> 00:35:21,311
I tried ...
but he wouldn't let me.

257
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,888
I'm sorry.

258
00:35:29,889 --> 00:35:32,889
I guess I didn't really know him.

259
00:35:35,295 --> 00:35:38,295
Look, what exactly
are we looking for anyway?

260
00:35:38,431 --> 00:35:40,165
Anything out of the ordinary,

261
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:43,166
possible clues
he may have left behind.

262
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:49,940
You?

263
00:35:51,711 --> 00:35:54,079
Yeah.

264
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,080
Did you love him?

265
00:35:58,551 --> 00:36:01,551
Well, yeah.
He was my dad.

266
00:36:06,526 --> 00:36:09,395
That was a long time ago.

267
00:36:09,396 --> 00:36:12,396
This is all the stuff that I have of his.
It doesn't seem like that much to go on.

268
00:36:15,101 --> 00:36:18,101
No. I need to see
where he lived.

269
00:36:46,566 --> 00:36:49,566
I can't believe he lived like this.

270
00:36:53,373 --> 00:36:56,373
Whoa.
Put that away.

271
00:36:56,476 --> 00:36:59,476
Don't you think it might
cause too much attention?

272
00:37:02,715 --> 00:37:05,715
- But this place, it's empty.
- Trust me on this.

273
00:37:06,419 --> 00:37:09,419
Besides,
this will probably be a lot easier.

274
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:16,159
Probably a lot quieter, too.

275
00:37:43,289 --> 00:37:46,289
Well, he's either very efficient ...

276
00:37:46,326 --> 00:37:49,326
Or?

277
00:37:50,597 --> 00:37:53,597
... or very narcissistic.

278
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,900
What do you mean?

279
00:38:04,811 --> 00:38:07,811
He worked his way out
in concentric circles.

280
00:38:09,249 --> 00:38:11,783
That's very efficient.

281
00:38:11,784 --> 00:38:14,784
What about the other possibility?

282
00:38:15,922 --> 00:38:18,922
He just enjoyed surrounding himself
with his handiwork --

283
00:38:19,692 --> 00:38:22,692
mayhem and death.

284
00:38:25,565 --> 00:38:28,565
Either way, he may have
become one of them.

285
00:38:33,139 --> 00:38:35,908
You don't mean that, uh ...

286
00:38:35,909 --> 00:38:38,909
... that he was responsible for this,
these -- these murders?

287
00:38:44,284 --> 00:38:47,284
I'm sorry.

288
00:39:05,138 --> 00:39:08,138
I wish I could
make it different.

289
00:39:12,412 --> 00:39:15,412
Underneath the surface,
you and I are not that different.

290
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:20,917
We, uh, just walk
in a different physical body.

291
00:39:24,357 --> 00:39:27,357
I am not the enemy.

292
00:39:28,461 --> 00:39:31,461
Yeah.

293
00:40:05,832 --> 00:40:08,832
It did spawn.

294
00:40:11,904 --> 00:40:14,904
How do you know?

295
00:40:15,475 --> 00:40:18,475
In that dog.

296
00:40:32,158 --> 00:40:35,158
These things ...

297
00:40:35,662 --> 00:40:38,662
... they're perfect killing machines.

298
00:40:39,132 --> 00:40:42,132
They stay in hibernation
until the conditions are right.

299
00:40:42,902 --> 00:40:45,902
The conditions
may have changed.

300
00:40:46,406 --> 00:40:48,607
They take what they want
when they want it.

301
00:40:48,608 --> 00:40:51,276
They use up a host body,
throw it out ...

302
00:40:51,277 --> 00:40:54,277
... and move on to the next.

303
00:40:57,517 --> 00:40:58,984
Wait.

304
00:40:58,985 --> 00:41:01,319
Wait a minute.

305
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,320
You're telling me
that these things are out there,

306
00:41:06,626 --> 00:41:09,094
and we're planning
to go after them alone?

307
00:41:09,095 --> 00:41:12,095
What, are you nuts?

308
00:41:12,532 --> 00:41:15,532
We tell the authorities,
they'll put me in an insane asylum.

309
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:19,037
Now, if I prove to them
who and what I am,

310
00:41:19,038 --> 00:41:20,772
they'll turn me
into a scientific specimen.

311
00:41:20,773 --> 00:41:23,773
There are no alternatives.

312
00:41:24,444 --> 00:41:27,312
Your people have nothing
capable of stopping them.

313
00:41:27,313 --> 00:41:30,282
Nothing.

314
00:41:30,283 --> 00:41:33,283
They will destroy you people,
and they will enjoy doing it.

315
00:41:36,355 --> 00:41:39,355
This is the only weapon
that can kill them.

316
00:41:40,426 --> 00:41:43,426
Let's just hope we find them
before it's too late.

317
00:41:47,266 --> 00:41:50,266
Great.
This is just great.

318
00:41:52,505 --> 00:41:55,505
They would never have spawned here,
it's too open, vulnerable.

319
00:41:56,509 --> 00:41:58,977
Wait.

320
00:41:58,978 --> 00:42:01,446
- What's that?
- What?

321
00:42:01,447 --> 00:42:04,447
That, off in the distance.

322
00:42:05,118 --> 00:42:07,252
I don't know.
A motor of some sort.

323
00:42:07,253 --> 00:42:10,253
No.

324
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,268
Music.

325
00:42:23,269 --> 00:42:25,637
You said they come out of hibernation
when the conditions are right.

326
00:42:25,638 --> 00:42:27,139
What did you mean?

327
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:30,075
Warmth, humidity ...

328
00:42:30,076 --> 00:42:33,076
... the proximity
of living human flesh.

329
00:42:34,013 --> 00:42:37,013
Potential hosts.

330
00:43:40,279 --> 00:43:43,279
We need to check
the lower levels.

331
00:43:57,630 --> 00:44:00,599
Look, would they really
be in a place like this?

332
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,600
This place, these people
would be perfect for them.

333
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:09,639
Once they come out of hibernation,
they could be in anybody.

334
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,520
You like that?
Very good.

335
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:01,050
They're here.

336
00:46:11,163 --> 00:46:12,998
Let's go, now.

337
00:46:12,999 --> 00:46:15,433
- Just leave? What about these?
- There's no time to explain.

338
00:46:15,434 --> 00:46:17,569
One of them's already gone.
That's much more dangerous.

339
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:20,570
We'll come back for these later.

340
00:46:42,895 --> 00:46:45,463
Hey, come on.

341
00:46:45,464 --> 00:46:48,464
Sorry.

342
00:46:50,636 --> 00:46:52,804
Hey.

343
00:46:52,805 --> 00:46:55,805
Okay.

344
00:48:02,741 --> 00:48:05,741
Wait here.
I'll be back.

345
00:48:08,914 --> 00:48:10,582
- Come on, man.
- Ow!

346
00:48:10,583 --> 00:48:13,583
Hey, asshole.

347
00:48:42,548 --> 00:48:44,382
We have to stop it
before it transfers again.

348
00:48:44,383 --> 00:48:45,850
What, that woman?

349
00:48:45,851 --> 00:48:48,253
It saw you, so you're in danger.

350
00:48:48,254 --> 00:48:50,922
If it comes after you,
this will slow it down.

351
00:48:50,923 --> 00:48:52,690
- It won't kill it?
- No.

352
00:48:52,691 --> 00:48:54,993
Now, listen, we don't have much time,
so listen carefully.

353
00:48:54,994 --> 00:48:57,595
The only way to stop it
is to force it out of the human host.

354
00:48:57,596 --> 00:48:59,831
Shoot to kill, not wound.

355
00:48:59,832 --> 00:49:02,133
Aim for the head
and the vital organs.

356
00:49:02,134 --> 00:49:05,134
When the body's no longer
able to function, it'll have to come out.

357
00:49:06,172 --> 00:49:09,172
- Then we're to kill it with this.
- But I've never shot a gun in my life.

358
00:49:09,942 --> 00:49:12,942
Let's hope you won't have to.

359
00:49:36,368 --> 00:49:39,368
Hey, I gotta tell you,
I never kiss on a first date.

360
00:49:39,438 --> 00:49:41,172
- Interesting.
- Yeah.

361
00:49:41,173 --> 00:49:44,173
Different.

362
00:50:25,117 --> 00:50:28,117
Hey, what the ...

363
00:50:29,121 --> 00:50:32,121
What?

364
00:50:37,062 --> 00:50:40,062
- Get off of me.
- Come on, man.

365
00:51:39,491 --> 00:51:42,491
You looking for me?

366
00:52:10,289 --> 00:52:13,289
Now you've really pissed me off.

367
00:52:22,801 --> 00:52:24,135
You okay?

368
00:52:24,136 --> 00:52:27,136
He'll have to change.
We must hurry.

369
00:52:29,842 --> 00:52:32,842
Hey, man.

370
00:52:32,878 --> 00:52:35,878
What the ...

371
00:52:48,427 --> 00:52:51,427
Let's go.

372
00:53:08,814 --> 00:53:11,814
That's not him.

373
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:45,080
Fuck you.
Without this you're nothing.

374
00:53:56,128 --> 00:53:59,128
You're not even worth killing.

375
00:54:04,603 --> 00:54:07,603
You couldn't
hurt me now if you tried.

376
00:54:12,744 --> 00:54:15,744
Fuck you, asshole.

377
00:54:20,752 --> 00:54:23,287
Are you all right?

378
00:54:23,288 --> 00:54:25,990
Am I all right?

379
00:54:25,991 --> 00:54:28,991
No, I am definitely not all right.

380
00:54:30,762 --> 00:54:33,762
There's nothing
that can stop that thing, nothing.

381
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:38,302
I am anything but all right.

382
00:54:38,303 --> 00:54:41,303
Well, what about
my father's weapon?

383
00:54:42,374 --> 00:54:43,608
Huh?

384
00:54:43,609 --> 00:54:46,609
My dad had a weapon
just like that.

385
00:56:32,718 --> 00:56:35,052
Check in with me in five minutes.

386
00:56:35,053 --> 00:56:37,688
It's one of the night guards.

387
00:56:37,689 --> 00:56:40,689
All right, listen carefully,
whatever happens, you find that weapon.

388
00:56:41,893 --> 00:56:43,728
Now, if I'm shot,
if I'm injured, even if I'm killed,

389
00:56:43,729 --> 00:56:45,963
you leave, I'll find you later.

390
00:56:45,964 --> 00:56:47,565
You gotta be kidding.

391
00:56:47,566 --> 00:56:50,566
- What, as someone else?
- If that's necessary.

392
00:56:58,076 --> 00:57:01,076
Hurry.

393
00:57:05,217 --> 00:57:08,152
Masterson, it looks like
we have a situation down here.

394
00:57:08,153 --> 00:57:11,153
Looks like a break and enter.

395
00:57:44,756 --> 00:57:47,756
- Got it.
- Let's go. Now!

396
00:58:11,016 --> 00:58:12,717
You know,
you're very good at this.

397
00:58:12,718 --> 00:58:14,251
Yeah?

398
00:58:14,252 --> 00:58:17,252
Maybe I have a future in crime.

399
00:58:21,126 --> 00:58:23,594
So, what now?

400
00:58:23,595 --> 00:58:26,595
We go back for the others.

401
00:58:27,966 --> 00:58:30,966
Before it's too late.

402
00:58:32,104 --> 00:58:35,104
You know, you sure know
how to show a gal a good time.

403
00:58:39,478 --> 00:58:42,478
You know, we haven't much time.
We better ... get on with it.

404
00:58:43,882 --> 00:58:46,882
Yeah.

405
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:34,830
The weapon.

406
00:59:35,534 --> 00:59:38,534
The weapon, now.

407
00:59:39,704 --> 00:59:41,906
Shoot me.

408
00:59:41,907 --> 00:59:44,907
Now, goddamn it!
Do it!

409
01:00:03,995 --> 01:00:06,995
Thanks.
I needed that.

410
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:09,033
I thought I killed you.

411
01:00:09,034 --> 01:00:11,268
The weapon has no effect
on human flesh.

412
01:00:11,269 --> 01:00:14,038
It's the wrong composition.

413
01:00:14,039 --> 01:00:16,006
You're cut.

414
01:00:16,007 --> 01:00:18,008
Hazard of the trade.

415
01:00:18,009 --> 01:00:21,009
- It doesn't look too deep, though.
- I think I'll survive.

416
01:00:36,328 --> 01:00:38,896
So, won't these spawn, too?

417
01:00:38,897 --> 01:00:40,497
Can't.

418
01:00:40,498 --> 01:00:43,033
Only the fully mature ones can
when they metamorphose.

419
01:00:43,034 --> 01:00:46,034
- So, what do we do now?
- There's no choice but to wait.

420
01:00:46,304 --> 01:00:47,605
Wait?

421
01:00:47,606 --> 01:00:50,241
That thing is out there,
and you intend just to wait?

422
01:00:50,242 --> 01:00:51,775
There's no way to track it.

423
01:00:51,776 --> 01:00:53,110
It will come back here,

424
01:00:53,111 --> 01:00:55,846
but first it will have to
go through the metamorphosis.

425
01:00:55,847 --> 01:00:58,847
Then, and only then,
will it return to protect its siblings.

426
01:01:00,852 --> 01:01:02,152
But they're dead.

427
01:01:02,153 --> 01:01:05,153
I know that,
and you know that, but it doesn't.

428
01:01:08,593 --> 01:01:11,593
I intend to be here
when it returns.

429
01:01:17,869 --> 01:01:20,170
How can we
just leave them there?

430
01:01:20,171 --> 01:01:23,171
The metamorphosis won't happen
for another 12-14 hours.

431
01:01:24,676 --> 01:01:26,277
So, in the meantime,
there's no reason to stay,

432
01:01:26,278 --> 01:01:29,278
as long as I'm back before it returns.

433
01:01:32,584 --> 01:01:35,584
What's wrong?

434
01:01:35,921 --> 01:01:37,321
What is it?

435
01:01:37,322 --> 01:01:40,322
It's nothing.
Just give me a moment.

436
01:01:40,525 --> 01:01:43,525
Are you okay?

437
01:01:45,063 --> 01:01:48,063
This body, it needs, uh ...

438
01:01:49,067 --> 01:01:52,067
... fuel.

439
01:01:53,772 --> 01:01:56,140
Oh, it's nothing.

440
01:01:56,141 --> 01:01:59,141
Really.

441
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:21,830
So, what the hell
happened to you back there?

442
01:02:22,334 --> 01:02:25,334
I told you, this body,
it needs fuel.

443
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:30,839
Look, I've seen hunger, I know hunger,
and that wasn't just hunger.

444
01:02:32,077 --> 01:02:35,077
No.
This body also needs rest.

445
01:02:35,981 --> 01:02:38,981
Food and rest?
You expect me to buy that?

446
01:02:40,919 --> 01:02:42,353
Food and rest ...

447
01:02:42,354 --> 01:02:45,354
Yes.

448
01:02:45,357 --> 01:02:48,192
I'd like you to buy that.

449
01:02:48,193 --> 01:02:51,193
I have no money.

450
01:03:08,847 --> 01:03:11,315
Oh, that's where I went to school.

451
01:03:11,316 --> 01:03:14,316
You went to school here?

452
01:03:15,186 --> 01:03:18,186
Yeah, Clinical Psych.
Got my residency, too.

453
01:03:19,357 --> 01:03:21,225
"Osu."

454
01:03:21,226 --> 01:03:24,226
No, OSU.
It's a university.

455
01:03:24,496 --> 01:03:26,563
It's a university.

456
01:03:26,564 --> 01:03:29,564
Yeah.

457
01:03:30,068 --> 01:03:33,068
Your people ...
very interesting people.

458
01:03:54,025 --> 01:03:57,025
Okay.

459
01:04:01,266 --> 01:04:04,266
Here, um, why don't you try this?
It might be a little easier.

460
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,175
Mmm.

461
01:04:11,176 --> 01:04:14,176
This is good, this food.

462
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:17,748
Mmm.

463
01:04:17,749 --> 01:04:20,749
Um ... what's it like
where you're from?

464
01:04:22,921 --> 01:04:25,222
Different.

465
01:04:25,223 --> 01:04:28,223
Tell me about it.

466
01:04:28,693 --> 01:04:31,693
Well, for one,
there's no Chinese food.

467
01:04:34,299 --> 01:04:37,299
No, really, what's it like?

468
01:04:38,403 --> 01:04:41,238
It's very different.

469
01:04:41,239 --> 01:04:44,239
It's like nothing
in your experience.

470
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:48,610
Well, describe it.
I wanna know.

471
01:04:51,716 --> 01:04:54,716
Energy, light.

472
01:04:56,821 --> 01:04:59,821
No physical body, just being.
We feel, but ... not as you do.

473
01:05:02,927 --> 01:05:05,927
We sense, but it's not concrete.
It's real, but not solid.

474
01:05:09,267 --> 01:05:12,267
We live in spirit, not in body.

475
01:05:13,805 --> 01:05:15,672
Hmm.

476
01:05:15,673 --> 01:05:18,008
Sounds like heaven.

477
01:05:18,009 --> 01:05:21,009
Like heaven?

478
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:24,980
Like heaven ...

479
01:05:25,283 --> 01:05:28,283
... but not.

480
01:05:29,554 --> 01:05:32,554
A hunger within
to feel, to touch ...

481
01:05:35,293 --> 01:05:38,162
... to breathe.

482
01:05:38,163 --> 01:05:39,930
My people,
we have learned to live with it.

483
01:05:39,931 --> 01:05:42,931
We ...

484
01:05:44,102 --> 01:05:46,203
The others, they have not.

485
01:05:46,204 --> 01:05:49,204
They have evolved
into the opposite --

486
01:05:50,074 --> 01:05:53,074
purely carnal, physical, evil.

487
01:05:54,779 --> 01:05:57,779
We and they, we are the same.

488
01:05:59,784 --> 01:06:02,319
So those things ...

489
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:05,320
Evolved from the same species.

490
01:06:40,692 --> 01:06:43,692
Here you go.
The couch is all yours.

491
01:06:43,928 --> 01:06:46,928
Thank you.

492
01:06:48,833 --> 01:06:51,833
But what am I gonna do with it,
this couch?

493
01:06:55,073 --> 01:06:57,874
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

494
01:06:57,875 --> 01:07:00,875
And I'll leave a toothbrush out for you.
I've got an extra one.

495
01:07:06,284 --> 01:07:09,284
Toothbrush.

496
01:07:37,682 --> 01:07:40,083
I'm sorry.

497
01:07:40,084 --> 01:07:43,084
I forgot you're not
from around these parts.

498
01:07:43,621 --> 01:07:45,455
Here, let me show you.

499
01:07:45,456 --> 01:07:48,456
Now, first, you have toothpaste.
It helps a lot.

500
01:07:49,327 --> 01:07:52,327
Go like this and that.

501
01:07:52,997 --> 01:07:55,165
Now, open up.

502
01:07:55,166 --> 01:07:58,166
Come on, try it.
You'll like it.

503
01:07:58,269 --> 01:08:01,269
Very good.
Now ...

504
01:08:08,813 --> 01:08:11,813
And over here.

505
01:08:12,216 --> 01:08:14,484
Nice?

506
01:08:14,485 --> 01:08:17,485
Ooh.

507
01:08:30,501 --> 01:08:33,501
Well, um ...

508
01:08:33,538 --> 01:08:36,538
You get the idea.

509
01:09:08,706 --> 01:09:11,706
This world of yours,
it's very beautiful.

510
01:09:12,443 --> 01:09:15,011
You sound sad.

511
01:09:15,012 --> 01:09:18,012
Well, to realize all the things
you've never had can make one sad.

512
01:09:19,917 --> 01:09:22,917
To feel, to touch ...

513
01:09:24,856 --> 01:09:27,856
... to fill your lungs
with crisp, fresh air ...

514
01:09:29,861 --> 01:09:32,861
... to feel hunger and thirst ...

515
01:09:34,132 --> 01:09:37,132
... even pain.

516
01:09:37,301 --> 01:09:40,301
All these things
I've never known before.

517
01:09:40,872 --> 01:09:43,872
- So much --
- Shh shh shh.

518
01:11:33,784 --> 01:11:36,784
Well, I ain't what you need,
but I'm what you want

519
01:11:38,322 --> 01:11:41,322
You need someone to rely on

520
01:11:46,964 --> 01:11:48,732
But on the other hand

521
01:11:48,733 --> 01:11:49,799
Can I help you?

522
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,735
If you want a party man

523
01:11:51,736 --> 01:11:54,736
Well, I ain't what you need,
but I'm what you want

524
01:11:55,373 --> 01:11:58,373
Yeah!

525
01:12:04,882 --> 01:12:07,384
This music, it stinks.

526
01:12:07,385 --> 01:12:10,186
Huh?

527
01:12:10,187 --> 01:12:13,187
I like this radio.

528
01:12:13,357 --> 01:12:16,192
Hey, now, wait a minute, partner.
Where you going with that thing?

529
01:12:16,193 --> 01:12:19,193
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Be real careful with that.

530
01:12:19,297 --> 01:12:21,965
- Don't touch that thing, man.
- I gotta go now.

531
01:12:21,966 --> 01:12:24,501
Don't put your hand on that, man.
That's real dangerous.

532
01:12:24,502 --> 01:12:27,502
Bye.

533
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:35,810
How's the car?
The car's down.

534
01:12:35,846 --> 01:12:38,846
- Oh, holy cow!
- Oh, my God!

535
01:12:43,588 --> 01:12:44,921
That's what I'm saying, you know?

536
01:12:44,922 --> 01:12:47,891
I mean, it's your world,
I'm just living in it, man.

537
01:12:47,892 --> 01:12:50,892
You hear the music?

538
01:12:53,731 --> 01:12:56,731
Hey, yo, man,
you're in the wrong part of town.

539
01:12:59,136 --> 01:13:01,071
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

540
01:13:01,072 --> 01:13:04,072
You crazy upside your head,
motherfucker?

541
01:13:05,509 --> 01:13:08,509
- Look at that.
- We gonna have some fun.

542
01:13:09,447 --> 01:13:11,348
Hey, man.

543
01:13:11,349 --> 01:13:14,349
Nice boom box, motherfucker.

544
01:13:18,322 --> 01:13:20,590
Nice car, motherfucker.

545
01:13:20,591 --> 01:13:23,426
Ooh! Yeah.

546
01:13:23,427 --> 01:13:25,395
You got balls dissing me, man.

547
01:13:25,396 --> 01:13:28,396
Now, give me the fucking box
and get your white ass outta here.

548
01:13:32,503 --> 01:13:35,503
Nice move.

549
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:39,140
What the fuck is he doing?

550
01:13:44,281 --> 01:13:47,281
I should do you right here,
motherfucker.

551
01:13:48,019 --> 01:13:51,019
Huh?

552
01:13:52,790 --> 01:13:55,790
Do him!

553
01:13:57,094 --> 01:13:59,095
Goddamn. What the fuck?
C-Come on, get in there, man!

554
01:13:59,096 --> 01:14:00,764
Wh-What the ...
Come on, come on.

555
01:14:00,765 --> 01:14:03,765
Shit. Come on.
Get -- get ...

556
01:14:04,468 --> 01:14:05,835
Hey.

557
01:14:05,836 --> 01:14:08,836
I said I like the car,
motherfucker.

558
01:14:09,607 --> 01:14:11,675
Let's drop this guy!

559
01:14:11,676 --> 01:14:14,676
- Go ahead, try me.
- Cool.

560
01:14:17,281 --> 01:14:20,281
You believe that?
Wasted him.

561
01:14:23,087 --> 01:14:25,221
The Caddies, khakis,
beanies, and dookie braids

562
01:14:25,222 --> 01:14:27,390
Pimpin' and livin'
because the system is fucked up

563
01:14:27,391 --> 01:14:30,391
Using any means necessary
just to come up

564
01:14:31,629 --> 01:14:33,863
I send my girl out,
I put a gat in her purse

565
01:14:33,864 --> 01:14:36,266
I say watch your back,
keep movin', don't sleep

566
01:14:36,267 --> 01:14:38,568
Cause slippin' will get you got
in some parts of IE

567
01:14:38,569 --> 01:14:41,569
I to the N --

568
01:15:25,449 --> 01:15:28,284
Hey, are you all right?

569
01:15:28,285 --> 01:15:30,220
Hey.

570
01:15:30,221 --> 01:15:33,221
Oh, my God.
You're burning up.

571
01:15:36,827 --> 01:15:39,827
- I'm gonna get a doctor.
- No doctor.

572
01:15:39,864 --> 01:15:42,864
- What are you talking about?
- No doctor!

573
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:45,900
Just give me a moment.
This will pass.

574
01:15:46,403 --> 01:15:49,239
Physical contact ...

575
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:52,240
... is an absolute concentration.

576
01:15:55,546 --> 01:15:58,546
Talk to me.
What is going on?

577
01:15:59,817 --> 01:16:02,817
- Difficult to explain.
- Try.

578
01:16:02,953 --> 01:16:05,953
Don't know if you wanna know.

579
01:16:06,423 --> 01:16:08,892
I do.

580
01:16:08,893 --> 01:16:11,893
I can't stay here forever.

581
01:16:12,763 --> 01:16:15,763
We change.

582
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:19,400
Some sooner, some later,
but for all of us ...

583
01:16:22,673 --> 01:16:25,275
... it's inevitable.

584
01:16:25,276 --> 01:16:27,544
What do you mean?

585
01:16:27,545 --> 01:16:30,545
If we stay, we become like them --
purely physical.

586
01:16:35,119 --> 01:16:36,820
It eats away at us like a cancer.

587
01:16:36,821 --> 01:16:39,821
We can fight it for a while,
but ultimately ...

588
01:16:40,257 --> 01:16:43,257
... there's nothing
we can do about it.

589
01:17:04,782 --> 01:17:07,250
Hey, what the ...

590
01:17:07,251 --> 01:17:10,251
What's going on?

591
01:17:11,522 --> 01:17:13,189
Whatever, brother.

592
01:17:13,190 --> 01:17:15,225
You feeling okay, buddy?

593
01:17:15,226 --> 01:17:18,027
Oh, now,
wait a minute there, bud.

594
01:17:18,028 --> 01:17:21,028
Hey!

595
01:17:21,966 --> 01:17:24,567
Someone better help him.

596
01:17:24,568 --> 01:17:27,568
You better go on in there,
see what's going on.

597
01:17:28,105 --> 01:17:31,105
You gotta be kidding me.

598
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:45,620
This food ... not very good.

599
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:49,790
Did you see that?

600
01:17:53,597 --> 01:17:56,597
I appreciate your offer,
but I have to do this alone.

601
01:17:59,336 --> 01:18:02,105
Look, I can't just sit here
waiting to find out what happened,

602
01:18:02,106 --> 01:18:04,807
wondering, worrying.

603
01:18:04,808 --> 01:18:07,808
It will already have metamorphosed.
It's too dangerous for you to come.

604
01:18:17,755 --> 01:18:20,755
I care for you.

605
01:18:25,262 --> 01:18:27,497
I care about you, too.

606
01:18:27,498 --> 01:18:30,400
It's bad enough
what will happen to me.

607
01:18:30,401 --> 01:18:33,369
It's part of what I do,
I've come to accept that,

608
01:18:33,370 --> 01:18:35,905
but if anything
were to happen to you ...

609
01:18:35,906 --> 01:18:38,341
I could never live with myself.

610
01:18:38,342 --> 01:18:41,342
And what about me?
I have feelings, too.

611
01:18:41,979 --> 01:18:44,979
Yes, but this is my battle.

612
01:18:49,586 --> 01:18:52,021
No.

613
01:18:52,022 --> 01:18:54,490
No, not anymore.

614
01:18:54,491 --> 01:18:57,491
Not since that thing
came here 15 years ago.

615
01:18:58,996 --> 01:19:01,996
Not since I lost my father.

616
01:19:05,436 --> 01:19:08,436
Look, if we don't destroy
that thing now, it's bad, right?

617
01:19:09,974 --> 01:19:12,974
Eventually it'll spawn again,
and we'll be in deep shit.

618
01:19:14,478 --> 01:19:17,478
"Deep shit."

619
01:19:18,816 --> 01:19:20,984
Yes, your people will be in that.

620
01:19:20,985 --> 01:19:23,985
In that case ...
I am coming with you.

621
01:19:24,655 --> 01:19:27,655
And if I can help just one little bit,
it'll be worth it.

622
01:19:31,795 --> 01:19:34,795
It will kill without hesitation.
We must do the same.

623
01:19:37,167 --> 01:19:40,167
It will show no mercy.
We must do likewise.

624
01:19:41,839 --> 01:19:44,839
It will be difficult to destroy.

625
01:19:46,076 --> 01:19:48,544
It will get ugly.

626
01:19:48,545 --> 01:19:51,545
I understand, but if not now,
if not by us, then what?

627
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:59,020
We must hurry.

628
01:20:00,391 --> 01:20:03,391
Let's rock and roll.

629
01:20:03,994 --> 01:20:06,994
It's a figure of speech, you know,
like "kick butt," "ice the mother."

630
01:20:40,864 --> 01:20:43,864
It's time.
We must hurry!

631
01:21:37,087 --> 01:21:40,087
Get down!

632
01:21:47,231 --> 01:21:50,231
Now aren't you glad I came?

633
01:22:04,014 --> 01:22:05,681
Listen, whatever happens,
don't let him take me.

634
01:22:05,682 --> 01:22:08,050
- Whatever you have to do, just do it.
- When I come up firing, you take off.

635
01:22:08,051 --> 01:22:10,353
- What?
- Just run. Run like hell.

636
01:22:10,354 --> 01:22:12,155
If one of us comes out of this,
at least there's hope.

637
01:22:12,156 --> 01:22:15,156
- But --
- Just do it! Now!

638
01:23:14,751 --> 01:23:17,751
Juliet!

639
01:23:22,526 --> 01:23:25,526
You son of a bitch.

640
01:23:40,644 --> 01:23:43,644
Eat this, motherfucker.

641
01:24:51,081 --> 01:24:54,081
It's over.
It's okay.

642
01:24:54,785 --> 01:24:57,785
It's over now.

643
01:25:02,993 --> 01:25:05,993
There's just one more thing I have to do
to prevent another spawning.

644
01:25:08,999 --> 01:25:11,999
But it's over.

645
01:25:34,691 --> 01:25:37,691
Juliet.

646
01:25:38,562 --> 01:25:41,562
Move very slowly.

647
01:25:55,579 --> 01:25:58,579
- You all right?
- Yes. Oh.

648
01:26:01,351 --> 01:26:04,351
I guess this just ain't my day.

649
01:26:16,433 --> 01:26:19,368
What's wrong?

650
01:26:19,369 --> 01:26:22,369
I can feel it inside me.

651
01:26:23,206 --> 01:26:26,206
- What?
- Change.

652
01:26:26,443 --> 01:26:29,443
If I stay ...

653
01:26:31,448 --> 01:26:34,448
... it's not gonna get any better.

654
01:26:34,851 --> 01:26:37,720
It'll only get worse.

655
01:26:37,721 --> 01:26:40,721
Like my father?

656
01:26:47,230 --> 01:26:50,230
What's that?

657
01:26:50,867 --> 01:26:53,867
Nothing.

658
01:26:54,905 --> 01:26:57,706
It's a saying
from our Book of Books.

659
01:26:57,707 --> 01:27:00,707
"The flower on the hill."

660
01:27:03,647 --> 01:27:06,647
I'd choose the few good years
I could have here with you.

661
01:27:06,883 --> 01:27:09,883
- And all this and --
- Shh.

662
01:27:11,822 --> 01:27:14,822
I've seen what it does,
what it did to my father.

663
01:27:17,427 --> 01:27:20,427
I care about you too much for that.

664
01:27:33,810 --> 01:27:36,810
It's the rest of the saying.

665
01:27:37,814 --> 01:27:40,814
"The flower on the hill,
like a stranger in a strange land,

666
01:27:42,552 --> 01:27:45,552
it passes like the wind."
