1
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:21,939
Tell me about mother
and father again?

2
00:00:23,321 --> 00:00:25,358
Ma and Pa got the fever
and went to sleep,

3
00:00:26,358 --> 00:00:28,695
and now they're in a big
white cloud with God.

4
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:31,531
Is heaven warm?

5
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:34,533
Nice and warm.

6
00:00:35,534 --> 00:00:38,237
Like a big down blanket
wrapped all around you.

7
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:42,341
No one's mean,
or hurts you in heaven?

8
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,310
No, my sweet.

9
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:49,415
When do we get to go?

10
00:00:51,683 --> 00:00:53,085
Only when it's your turn.

11
00:00:55,753 --> 00:00:57,156
How will we know when?

12
00:00:58,857 --> 00:01:00,092
You'll know.

13
00:01:00,725 --> 00:01:02,228
But only when it's your turn.

14
00:01:04,662 --> 00:01:05,765
Do you miss them?

15
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:08,835
Of course I do, silly.

16
00:01:10,335 --> 00:01:11,304
Me too.

17
00:01:13,572 --> 00:01:15,374
<i>Whores.</i>

18
00:01:15,406 --> 00:01:16,575
I'm scared.

19
00:01:16,608 --> 00:01:18,210
Cover your eyes.

20
00:01:21,914 --> 00:01:25,385
I'm always gonna be here
to protect you, okay?

21
00:01:26,284 --> 00:01:27,554
And I'll protect you.

22
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:32,924
<i>Whore,
get yourself cleaned up,</i>

23
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,627
<i>you've got a customer.</i>

24
00:01:35,861 --> 00:01:38,498
Okay. Go hide in the closet,
cover your ears and hum the song

25
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:39,699
until I come get you.

26
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:42,501
I'll be okay.

27
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:44,170
I always am.

28
00:01:52,578 --> 00:01:53,713
Cover your ears.

29
00:01:53,745 --> 00:01:55,414
Don't come out until I get you.

30
00:02:07,192 --> 00:02:09,228
-Where is she?
-Sir.

31
00:02:10,295 --> 00:02:11,697
The girl, your sister.
Where is she?

32
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:13,798
She... She's not here sir.

33
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:15,534
She...

34
00:02:20,205 --> 00:02:21,441
Listen to me!

35
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:24,176
I'ma let you breathe again
and when I do

36
00:02:24,376 --> 00:02:26,846
you're gonna tell him
exactly what he wants to hear.

37
00:02:30,582 --> 00:02:31,818
Please.

38
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:36,256
Please, she's just a child.

39
00:02:36,722 --> 00:02:38,891
Please, just let her be.

40
00:02:38,924 --> 00:02:41,326
She's...
Just give her a few more years.

41
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,796
-Maybe I can work up her debt...
-It's too late for that.

42
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:46,331
She's gonna have to work harder
now that you're sold.

43
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:49,836
No. We have to stay together!

44
00:03:12,324 --> 00:03:14,294
I own you now.

45
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:21,334
Alice!

46
00:03:40,368 --> 00:03:46,240
<b>TAINTED:
THE HAUNTING OF ALICE D.</b>

47
00:03:48,484 --> 00:03:51,484
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

48
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,510
<i>Come on,
don't bail on me.</i>

49
00:05:49,047 --> 00:05:50,649
All right.

50
00:05:50,682 --> 00:05:52,117
I'll switch shifts or something.

51
00:06:47,605 --> 00:06:49,141
You're always
so good to me, Joe.

52
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:52,979
Thank you.

53
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,182
What are you doing
tomorrow night?

54
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:58,885
Working.

55
00:07:01,185 --> 00:07:02,555
Wanna make triple?

56
00:07:03,187 --> 00:07:04,557
I'm not like that, honey.

57
00:07:05,723 --> 00:07:07,593
But the next girls walking in,

58
00:07:08,226 --> 00:07:09,828
they're more what you like.

59
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:12,632
See you next week.

60
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:15,201
Yeah, you will.

61
00:07:19,137 --> 00:07:20,540
Dude.

62
00:07:22,107 --> 00:07:23,843
What took you so long?

63
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,611
Stuck at work.

64
00:07:27,211 --> 00:07:29,247
-Thank you.
-You work too much.

65
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:31,983
Not everyone's a rich
bastard like you, bro.

66
00:07:37,822 --> 00:07:39,991
-Wassup, buddy.
-Wassup, man.

67
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:41,960
Sammie.

68
00:07:43,528 --> 00:07:45,163
Hey, get these boys
some drinks, will you?

69
00:07:45,197 --> 00:07:46,632
Sure, absolutely.

70
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:51,736
From the party?

71
00:07:51,769 --> 00:07:54,806
-Who else is coming?
-Plus you guys, Michael.

72
00:07:55,072 --> 00:07:57,642
-He's coming down from the city.
-Nice man it's been a while.

73
00:07:57,675 --> 00:07:59,077
Yeah I'm bringing Lex.

74
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,713
-Nice.
-Tapping it yet?

75
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:04,984
No, but I think she's gonna take
the inaugural spin this week.

76
00:08:05,016 --> 00:08:06,851
-That a boy.
-It's about time.

77
00:08:06,884 --> 00:08:09,555
I don't know if I'ma be
able to make it though.

78
00:08:09,821 --> 00:08:13,025
I told Krista
I'd hang out with her.

79
00:08:13,057 --> 00:08:14,225
For Christ's sake.

80
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:15,628
Are you serious?

81
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,229
Unless she can come.

82
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,764
Unless she can...
She hates me man.

83
00:08:20,298 --> 00:08:22,634
I know but just like a...
Just a little.

84
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:26,538
Dude ditch the bitch
come hang with us.

85
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,774
All right I'll talk to her.
But you know how she is.

86
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:31,076
-All right, you'll talk to her?
-You know how she is.

87
00:08:31,108 --> 00:08:32,677
Come on.

88
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:34,580
Weak dude. Weak.

89
00:08:35,113 --> 00:08:36,816
Here we go.

90
00:08:46,124 --> 00:08:47,125
Hello.

91
00:08:47,658 --> 00:08:49,694
I heard you do private parties?

92
00:08:50,128 --> 00:08:52,098
What type of private parties?

93
00:08:52,697 --> 00:08:54,899
Let's just say
there's a lot more wads of cash

94
00:08:54,932 --> 00:08:56,836
for the right type of dancing.

95
00:09:02,274 --> 00:09:03,609
I'm in.

96
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:05,278
Yeah, you are.

97
00:09:09,014 --> 00:09:10,916
<i>Zeke, it's me.</i>

98
00:09:12,317 --> 00:09:13,653
<i>Open the door.</i>

99
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:31,336
I've got
the really good stuff.

100
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,638
Acid.

101
00:09:33,705 --> 00:09:34,807
Now I was thinking
we could do it tomorrow night.

102
00:09:38,342 --> 00:09:41,179
-God, you smell like cigars.
-I was at the titty bar.

103
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:47,753
And you didn't invite me?

104
00:09:47,785 --> 00:09:49,754
Wasn't very much fun anyway.

105
00:09:49,788 --> 00:09:51,289
'cause I wasn't there.

106
00:09:52,823 --> 00:09:54,192
You don't like my friends.

107
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:56,028
I like most of them.

108
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,165
<i>How are you?</i>

109
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:36,168
I'm Adam.

110
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:37,336
-What's up.
-Hey, Adam.

111
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:38,737
-Hi Anita.
-Hello.

112
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:40,139
-Hey.
-It's Jenny right?

113
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:42,074
-Yeah.
-Good, thanks for coming.

114
00:10:42,106 --> 00:10:43,742
-What's up?
-Come on in.

115
00:10:44,775 --> 00:10:46,411
This place is sick.

116
00:10:46,845 --> 00:10:48,180
It's a nice
little home, isn't it?

117
00:10:48,212 --> 00:10:49,347
This is so cool, yeah.

118
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:50,981
Have a seat ladies,
make yourselves comfortable.

119
00:10:51,015 --> 00:10:52,884
Yeah, absolutely.

120
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,753
That's not even sexy.

121
00:10:56,354 --> 00:10:58,257
Hey where are you two
scoundrels running off to?

122
00:11:00,024 --> 00:11:02,126
-My god.
-He's my cousin.

123
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:04,262
He hits puberty
and look at him go.

124
00:11:06,197 --> 00:11:08,233
They're gonna get lost
in this place man, it's huge.

125
00:11:08,866 --> 00:11:09,934
It's crazy.

126
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:11,269
I told you
it was awesome.

127
00:11:12,203 --> 00:11:13,371
Hey, look at that.

128
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:16,008
1898, baby.

129
00:11:16,774 --> 00:11:19,310
-That's kind of creepy.
-I know.

130
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:24,016
Yeah, kind of turns me on,
actually.

131
00:11:24,448 --> 00:11:26,851
We need some drinks don't we?
You want some drinks?

132
00:11:26,884 --> 00:11:28,352
-Yes.
-Okay.

133
00:11:28,385 --> 00:11:30,722
Mind if we explore
the place a little?

134
00:11:30,755 --> 00:11:32,490
By all means,
yes, just don't get lost.

135
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:34,025
Make sure you come back.

136
00:11:37,495 --> 00:11:39,831
See you in a little bit boys.

137
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,267
Bye bye.

138
00:12:12,496 --> 00:12:14,733
This place is ridiculous.

139
00:12:24,975 --> 00:12:27,078
Jesus.

140
00:14:00,404 --> 00:14:01,874
Stop it.

141
00:14:03,575 --> 00:14:06,011
Really is good to see you, man.

142
00:14:06,043 --> 00:14:07,278
You too buddy.

143
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:11,048
Basement hasn't
changed much?

144
00:14:11,081 --> 00:14:13,085
-Since we were kids.
-No.

145
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:15,287
-This place still creeps me out.
-Very creepy.

146
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,357
Hey, let's get that wood
on the fire.

147
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:19,658
Let's do it.

148
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:21,093
Party time.

149
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:24,963
-There you are.
-There you are.

150
00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:26,465
-Hey.
-You get lost or what?

151
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,200
I'm trying to.

152
00:14:28,232 --> 00:14:30,067
-This place is amazing.
-It's not hard.

153
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,403
Yeah, it looks good.

154
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:35,274
Hello.

155
00:14:38,176 --> 00:14:40,045
This place is amazing.

156
00:14:40,711 --> 00:14:42,914
Yeah, you should see my place.

157
00:14:42,947 --> 00:14:45,049
-Why, is it like this?
-No, but you should see it.

158
00:14:45,082 --> 00:14:47,184
Okay, awesome.

159
00:14:47,217 --> 00:14:48,519
Yeah.

160
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,360
Man, look at them.

161
00:14:54,591 --> 00:14:56,095
Told you.

162
00:14:56,427 --> 00:14:58,462
Get 'em all for yourself, man.

163
00:14:58,495 --> 00:15:00,531
Yeah, life is good,
can't complain.

164
00:15:03,368 --> 00:15:05,003
-What's up man.
-What's up Zeke.

165
00:15:05,035 --> 00:15:06,537
-Not much. How you doing?
-Good to see you.

166
00:15:06,571 --> 00:15:08,407
-Where were you man?
-I was there sneaking a beer.

167
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,575
Okay.

168
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,110
I was in the fridge.
How you doing?

169
00:15:12,143 --> 00:15:14,112
-I haven't seen you in ages.
-It's been a while.

170
00:15:14,144 --> 00:15:15,614
-Yeah.
-You still in the city?

171
00:15:15,647 --> 00:15:16,982
NYC. You need to come visit.

172
00:15:17,014 --> 00:15:18,417
Yeah I will.
You still acting?

173
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,218
-Still trying.
-Think you can get me in there.

174
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,519
-Yeah.
-Nice dude.

175
00:15:21,552 --> 00:15:23,956
I seen you on that...
What was it?

176
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:26,158
-The hemorrhoids commercial?
-Constipation.

177
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:27,459
Sorry, man.

178
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:30,195
I've obviously got the face
of a man who can't shit.

179
00:15:32,163 --> 00:15:33,264
Painful.

180
00:15:33,298 --> 00:15:35,133
-Twenty grand.
-Woo, yeah.

181
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,435
-Krista.
-Hey.

182
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:38,302
-How are you?
-Good how are you?

183
00:15:38,336 --> 00:15:40,639
-Good, real good to see you.
-You're famous.

184
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:43,008
-I wouldn't say that.
-Yeah, you are.

185
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,643
We just stopped
by for a little bit.

186
00:15:44,676 --> 00:15:45,978
Very cool.

187
00:15:47,044 --> 00:15:47,979
Zeke, it's nice to see
you brought your own hoe.

188
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,247
Up yours, Joe.

189
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,549
And nice to see you too, Krista.

190
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:54,052
So, place looks good?

191
00:15:54,085 --> 00:15:56,288
Yeah, it's bomb, dude,
the crown...

192
00:15:56,321 --> 00:15:58,623
All this inset
in the ceiling. This...

193
00:15:58,655 --> 00:16:00,992
They did a nice job
restoring it. It's real nice.

194
00:16:01,025 --> 00:16:02,560
Yeah, it's kind of weird though

195
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,730
that your dad restored
this place after what happened.

196
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,031
-Hey.
-Hey.

197
00:16:06,063 --> 00:16:07,732
Every home has a history.

198
00:16:08,332 --> 00:16:10,735
Some are just
more flavorful than others.

199
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:12,071
Yeah,

200
00:16:32,823 --> 00:16:34,025
Hey.

201
00:16:40,597 --> 00:16:42,767
So did Joe tell you
about the house?

202
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,172
It used to be a brothel.

203
00:16:52,777 --> 00:16:55,214
Joe's great grandpa founded it.

204
00:16:58,249 --> 00:16:59,585
You got me.

205
00:17:00,184 --> 00:17:02,220
I'm the descendant of pimps.

206
00:17:03,087 --> 00:17:04,689
Well, if he didn't tell you
about the house,

207
00:17:04,721 --> 00:17:07,091
then he certainly didn't
tell you about Alice.

208
00:17:10,461 --> 00:17:12,597
<i>It all started
over 100 years ago.</i>

209
00:17:13,163 --> 00:17:15,401
<i>Two sisters were forced
into prostitution.</i>

210
00:17:16,634 --> 00:17:19,238
<i>Their names were Alice
and her sister Delilah.</i>

211
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,074
<i>Their parents had died
of a terrible fever leaving</i>

212
00:17:22,106 --> 00:17:24,843
<i>the two girls and their
only known relative,</i>

213
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,444
<i>an uncle.</i>

214
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:29,114
<i>Unfortunately their uncle
was a horrible man</i>

215
00:17:29,146 --> 00:17:30,781
<i>who had a gambling problem.</i>

216
00:17:30,815 --> 00:17:33,818
<i>He sold the girls to a local
brothel, which was owned</i>

217
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:37,456
<i>by Joe's great grandpa,
Sr. Davenport,</i>

218
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,290
<i>to repay his debt.</i>

219
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,359
Use her for something.

220
00:17:41,792 --> 00:17:43,394
You eat like a horse.

221
00:17:43,428 --> 00:17:45,230
What'd you say?

222
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,567
I said it is he
who eats like a horse.

223
00:17:49,867 --> 00:17:51,470
Reply with a sir!

224
00:17:52,336 --> 00:17:55,406
It is he who eats
like a horse. Sir.

225
00:17:58,442 --> 00:18:00,377
Innocence mixed with defiance.

226
00:18:00,411 --> 00:18:02,214
-Yes.
-I like it.

227
00:18:04,148 --> 00:18:07,151
You'll find that they're
usually very obedient.

228
00:18:07,184 --> 00:18:09,453
Especially the older one.

229
00:18:09,487 --> 00:18:12,224
But you'll have no problems.

230
00:18:17,327 --> 00:18:18,430
What's your name?

231
00:18:18,462 --> 00:18:19,565
Alice.

232
00:18:21,398 --> 00:18:23,734
From now on
you're Alice D.

233
00:18:36,713 --> 00:18:38,450
<i>Years went by,</i>

234
00:18:38,482 --> 00:18:40,918
<i>and Alice grew into a beautiful
young woman.</i>

235
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:42,753
<i>Constantly defiant.</i>

236
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:45,356
<i>Sr. Davenport had her chained
to the bed.</i>

237
00:18:46,523 --> 00:18:49,627
<i>Her beauty and spirit
were what Sr. Davenport</i>

238
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,296
<i>loved the most.</i>

239
00:19:42,747 --> 00:19:44,615
No, no.

240
00:20:43,374 --> 00:20:44,643
So,
what happened to her?

241
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,510
She offed herself.

242
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:53,285
That's a beautiful
little story.

243
00:20:53,584 --> 00:20:55,254
Except it's not a story.

244
00:20:55,987 --> 00:20:57,489
It's the truth and you know it.

245
00:21:01,692 --> 00:21:05,596
Hey, why you gotta come
in here and be a buzz kill?

246
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,966
-Are you jealous?
-No.

247
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:11,636
I think you're jealous.

248
00:21:13,671 --> 00:21:15,507
I think you want this.

249
00:21:16,874 --> 00:21:18,777
I don't wanna be
anything like you.

250
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:20,811
Or your family.

251
00:21:20,845 --> 00:21:22,747
Treating people
like their objects,

252
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:25,517
making money off
of human slaves.

253
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:27,853
How original.

254
00:21:28,653 --> 00:21:30,855
That was a long
time ago, sweetheart.

255
00:21:30,887 --> 00:21:32,823
Yeah.
Except all through high school

256
00:21:32,856 --> 00:21:35,626
you used to brag
about your family history.

257
00:21:37,028 --> 00:21:38,630
Look at you.

258
00:21:38,663 --> 00:21:40,932
You're still treating
women like objects.

259
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,336
Women are objects.

260
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:50,008
Beautiful luscious objects.

261
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:55,379
And it seems to be sometimes
they like to be objectified.

262
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:57,649
Am I right?

263
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:01,452
Listen, Krista,

264
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,991
I'm sorry but...
I'm just not that into you.

265
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:12,030
I know deep down inside
you wanna climb up on me

266
00:22:12,063 --> 00:22:13,798
and hate fuck.

267
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,766
But you're just not my type.

268
00:22:16,933 --> 00:22:18,470
I hate you.

269
00:22:19,703 --> 00:22:24,875
Well, if you hate me so much,
and if you hate all of this,

270
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:27,778
why don't you just beat it.

271
00:22:28,011 --> 00:22:30,048
I think I'm ready to go.

272
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,616
Okay.

273
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,053
That was an all-time record.

274
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:37,923
Don't let Alice
scare you too much.

275
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,905
Not here.

276
00:22:54,939 --> 00:22:56,842
I want a nicer room.

277
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:00,911
Yes ma'am.

278
00:23:17,094 --> 00:23:18,596
Hey.

279
00:23:19,063 --> 00:23:20,132
Hey.

280
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,036
I'm Michael, I don't know
if you remember from earlier.

281
00:23:25,068 --> 00:23:26,637
-Jenny.
-Hey, Jenny.

282
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:27,706
Hey.

283
00:23:28,005 --> 00:23:30,742
It's a pretty cool place

284
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:35,513
So you know Joe,
is that right?

285
00:23:35,546 --> 00:23:37,749
No, I know Natasha.

286
00:23:38,215 --> 00:23:40,484
You're friends with Natasha.

287
00:23:42,086 --> 00:23:43,887
How do you guys
know each other?

288
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:46,024
We just know each other.

289
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,426
Work.

290
00:23:52,963 --> 00:23:54,198
You okay?

291
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:56,801
Yeah.

292
00:23:57,134 --> 00:23:59,136
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

293
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,471
It's just...

294
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:02,441
It's nothing. I'm...

295
00:24:02,807 --> 00:24:04,776
I'm ready to party.

296
00:24:05,809 --> 00:24:07,945
-Do you wanna get a drink?
-Yeah, I'm sorry.

297
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:10,548
-I should have offered.
-Yeah. Okay.

298
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,230
Krista brought that, man.

299
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,532
-Really?
-Yes.

300
00:24:27,731 --> 00:24:29,000
It's not really smart
leaving that stuff around you,

301
00:24:29,032 --> 00:24:30,134
I know that for sure.

302
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:32,237
She put a nice little ribbon
on there and everything.

303
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:33,471
Nice.

304
00:24:35,972 --> 00:24:38,576
-Classy chick.
-Yeah, she is.

305
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:42,779
Well, at least
she's got good taste in liquor.

306
00:24:42,813 --> 00:24:44,516
-Shall we?
-Yeah, man, pour some out.

307
00:24:45,148 --> 00:24:46,850
Hey, you guys,
want some whiskey?

308
00:24:46,884 --> 00:24:47,986
Yeah, cool.

309
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,120
All right.

310
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,992
Jesus.

311
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:56,894
How many staircases
are in this place?

312
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,763
A lot. Let's go.

313
00:24:59,329 --> 00:25:00,764
<i>Pictures and paintings.</i>

314
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:02,032
<i>Is that it?</i>

315
00:25:03,634 --> 00:25:04,836
Yeah this is it.

316
00:25:04,868 --> 00:25:06,670
Yeah.
There it is my man.

317
00:25:06,703 --> 00:25:08,005
Right there.

318
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:09,740
Isn't this the Rumsky room?

319
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,176
This is the Rumsky room.
Sally Rumsky.

320
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:15,779
Your old blue bags,
your remember her?

321
00:25:15,813 --> 00:25:17,782
Damn that girl had a...

322
00:25:17,815 --> 00:25:19,750
Sally Rumsky didn't hear it.

323
00:25:20,017 --> 00:25:21,686
This is the stash spot
right here man.

324
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:23,187
Many o nights.

325
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:28,759
Memories, man.

326
00:25:28,792 --> 00:25:30,828
Memories. Memories.

327
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,978
So... Jen.

328
00:25:49,646 --> 00:25:51,782
I didn't get to meet you
last night but...

329
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:53,151
I'm glad you're here.

330
00:25:53,617 --> 00:25:54,752
Thanks.

331
00:25:55,885 --> 00:25:58,189
Did Natasha explain
everything to you?

332
00:25:58,221 --> 00:25:59,924
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

333
00:26:00,223 --> 00:26:02,961
Tasha, you explain
the rules to Jen?

334
00:26:06,396 --> 00:26:08,231
I just wanna make sure
we're cool.

335
00:26:08,265 --> 00:26:09,267
Yeah.

336
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:11,802
I mean I love to have
a good time and...

337
00:26:12,303 --> 00:26:14,606
I wanna make sure
we're on the same page.

338
00:26:16,906 --> 00:26:20,711
You see, I'm paying
you a lot of money,

339
00:26:21,244 --> 00:26:24,648
which means I own
your ass tonight.

340
00:26:26,116 --> 00:26:29,053
Anything me
and my boys want, we get.

341
00:26:30,287 --> 00:26:32,123
You got it?

342
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:34,726
Yeah.

343
00:26:36,894 --> 00:26:37,895
Okay.

344
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,266
Put that down.

345
00:26:44,335 --> 00:26:45,769
Hey, hey.

346
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:54,144
Hey. Relax. Relax.

347
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,681
Relax.

348
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,125
Just relax.

349
00:27:13,096 --> 00:27:14,833
Yeah, that's better.

350
00:27:17,101 --> 00:27:18,370
That's better.

351
00:27:19,036 --> 00:27:21,372
So you're not even gonna
get like a small percentage

352
00:27:21,404 --> 00:27:24,075
of trust fund or whatever?

353
00:27:24,842 --> 00:27:26,911
Probably not.
You still love me?

354
00:27:29,246 --> 00:27:30,415
Here we go.

355
00:27:33,917 --> 00:27:35,986
Hey, what about this one, baby?

356
00:27:36,019 --> 00:27:37,221
Yeah.

357
00:27:37,253 --> 00:27:38,656
Looks good.

358
00:27:48,732 --> 00:27:50,734
This place is so big.

359
00:27:51,134 --> 00:27:53,104
Just keeps going and going.

360
00:28:02,011 --> 00:28:04,148
Maybe I should have slept
with your cousin.

361
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:07,018
If he wasn't such a prick.

362
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:10,088
You better be kidding.

363
00:28:18,162 --> 00:28:20,899
There's like so many
random little crevices.

364
00:28:22,031 --> 00:28:23,300
Hey, come here.

365
00:28:24,134 --> 00:28:25,336
Babe?

366
00:28:25,368 --> 00:28:27,003
What?
What's the matter?

367
00:28:27,037 --> 00:28:28,773
Were you looking
at that whore downstairs

368
00:28:28,806 --> 00:28:29,841
in the butt dress?

369
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,476
Hey, don't say that, all right?

370
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:35,913
I don't care
about anyone but you.

371
00:28:37,047 --> 00:28:38,115
It's just that...

372
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:42,019
right when that one girl
with the black dress...

373
00:28:42,051 --> 00:28:43,820
came in.

374
00:28:43,854 --> 00:28:45,088
Yeah.

375
00:28:45,122 --> 00:28:48,293
You just kind of stopped
kissing me.

376
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:52,262
No, I didn't

377
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:56,934
But, that doesn't matter
now because...

378
00:28:57,468 --> 00:29:01,506
you are my little angel,
and this is our weekend.

379
00:29:06,477 --> 00:29:08,379
What is this?

380
00:29:14,218 --> 00:29:15,487
Well, that's kind of sexy.

381
00:29:16,586 --> 00:29:18,021
They just hooked onto the bed?

382
00:29:19,957 --> 00:29:21,025
You wanna use them?

383
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:23,361
Come on, let's use them.

384
00:29:24,595 --> 00:29:25,462
Or not.

385
00:29:26,196 --> 00:29:27,431
You know those whores
are going to hell.

386
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:29,433
Just kiss me.

387
00:29:39,576 --> 00:29:42,078
If you wanna use them,
we can but we don't have to.

388
00:29:42,112 --> 00:29:43,515
Tonight might be special.

389
00:29:51,622 --> 00:29:53,124
-What the hell was that?
-What was that?

390
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,368
Do you hear that?

391
00:30:56,653 --> 00:30:57,888
Go!

392
00:30:59,623 --> 00:31:01,558
Get out!
Get out!

393
00:31:24,181 --> 00:31:25,982
-Lighten up.
-Okay.

394
00:31:26,016 --> 00:31:27,585
-Drink, okay?
-Okay.

395
00:31:46,569 --> 00:31:48,972
Trying to blaze.

396
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,375
They're hot chicks, man, right?

397
00:31:51,407 --> 00:31:52,476
Yeah.

398
00:31:53,042 --> 00:31:54,277
Yeah.

399
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,047
Joe out did himself, man.

400
00:31:57,347 --> 00:32:00,417
...That Jenny girl
seems like a sweetheart.

401
00:32:02,251 --> 00:32:03,488
Do you sweet on her?

402
00:32:04,221 --> 00:32:06,290
Yeah, I sweet on her.

403
00:32:06,757 --> 00:32:08,459
I knew you would be.

404
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:10,995
No, I mean she seems sweet.

405
00:32:11,028 --> 00:32:13,163
She's... Yeah, she's shy.

406
00:32:13,196 --> 00:32:15,299
I don't think she realized
how gorgeous she is.

407
00:32:19,536 --> 00:32:21,673
You... You want her first?

408
00:32:24,407 --> 00:32:26,743
I'm just saying
if you like her, you know...

409
00:32:26,777 --> 00:32:29,080
You should probably
get with that first.

410
00:32:30,413 --> 00:32:32,016
Just a thought,
that's all I'm saying.

411
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:37,254
And she's perfect I mean,
she's totally perfect for you.

412
00:32:37,287 --> 00:32:39,656
Joe must have picked her out.

413
00:32:40,356 --> 00:32:42,292
For you, particularly.

414
00:32:44,193 --> 00:32:47,365
What do you mean,
Joe picked her out for me?

415
00:32:47,631 --> 00:32:49,633
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

416
00:32:49,665 --> 00:32:51,402
What you just said.

417
00:32:51,434 --> 00:32:53,671
Joe must have
picked her out for me.

418
00:32:55,105 --> 00:32:56,341
My god.

419
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,711
-The girls are hookers, man.
-Are you serious?

420
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:01,346
Yeah.

421
00:33:06,115 --> 00:33:07,117
Holy shit.

422
00:33:09,619 --> 00:33:11,288
Dude, I wouldn't worry about it,
they're totally paid for.

423
00:33:12,355 --> 00:33:15,058
Courtesy Joe, man.
He hooked it up.

424
00:33:17,193 --> 00:33:21,598
Yeah, well, look Adam,
I don't have to pay for sex.

425
00:33:23,467 --> 00:33:24,468
I do.

426
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,070
I mean, I don't, but I do.

427
00:33:27,671 --> 00:33:31,107
Like sometimes,
depending on the chick really.

428
00:33:31,141 --> 00:33:34,545
Fat girls, they love me,
I don't know why.

429
00:33:34,845 --> 00:33:37,315
Gravitational pulls,
I don't know.

430
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:39,650
She seemed like a cool chick.

431
00:33:44,821 --> 00:33:46,456
No, dude,
I wouldn't worry about it.

432
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:48,759
Just bang the hell out of her,
and then love will follow.

433
00:33:49,425 --> 00:33:51,662
Aren't you guys getting
a little too old for this shit?

434
00:33:51,694 --> 00:33:54,531
I mean you were pulling these
pranks back in high school.

435
00:33:55,365 --> 00:33:57,367
No, man, I don't think so.

436
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:04,375
Great.

437
00:34:04,607 --> 00:34:06,277
I came all the way home
for this party

438
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:07,811
and all the girls
are prostitutes.

439
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:09,112
That's fantastic.

440
00:34:10,447 --> 00:34:11,816
This is fantastic, guys.

441
00:34:12,782 --> 00:34:14,418
You know,
if I wanted a hooker

442
00:34:14,451 --> 00:34:16,153
I could have just stayed
in New York.

443
00:34:16,186 --> 00:34:17,188
Dude.

444
00:34:17,721 --> 00:34:19,289
What are you talking about?

445
00:34:19,322 --> 00:34:22,125
Dude, it's gonna be amazing.
Hey, Michael!

446
00:34:22,492 --> 00:34:23,594
Shit.

447
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,463
This place is haunted.

448
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:31,469
All women are whores, okay?

449
00:34:31,501 --> 00:34:33,237
These one's aren't allowed
to play hard to get.

450
00:34:33,269 --> 00:34:35,572
-Dude.
-Hey, lighten up.

451
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:36,674
All right?

452
00:34:37,807 --> 00:34:39,576
Get yourself a drink.
Let's have some fun, come on.

453
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:43,581
He's right, you know.

454
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,215
Women.

455
00:34:57,327 --> 00:34:58,462
What's wrong with you?

456
00:34:58,494 --> 00:35:00,263
At least
they're not bad looking.

457
00:35:00,297 --> 00:35:01,798
I mean they're
good looking guys.

458
00:35:01,831 --> 00:35:04,734
At least they're not...
Fat and hairy.

459
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,538
Or smelly, ew.

460
00:35:07,938 --> 00:35:11,442
Anita, can you go hang out
with the guys a little bit?

461
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:12,876
Give us a second.

462
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,512
Fine.

463
00:35:25,454 --> 00:35:27,458
Listen you're gonna stop
pouting and start having fun,

464
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:30,260
or else this is gonna be
the worst night of your life.

465
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:32,663
Hey.
I'm talking to you.

466
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:36,467
Do you want the money or not?
Because it's kinda a done deal.

467
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,934
Yeah, I need money.

468
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:39,869
I have my tuition
and my sister's sick...

469
00:35:39,902 --> 00:35:42,772
I don't... You don't
have to tell me why, okay?

470
00:35:43,306 --> 00:35:46,343
We all have our reasons for
being here, trust me, I get it.

471
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:50,580
You have to be appearing
to have fun, okay?

472
00:35:50,614 --> 00:35:53,451
You're making me look like
an idiot for bringing you here.

473
00:35:54,217 --> 00:35:56,586
Do you know how many girls
would have clawed your eyes out

474
00:35:56,619 --> 00:35:57,621
for this job?

475
00:35:58,487 --> 00:35:59,523
Tons.

476
00:36:00,456 --> 00:36:02,559
He wanted someone sweet
and innocent

477
00:36:02,592 --> 00:36:04,627
and lucky for you,
you're the only bitch I know

478
00:36:04,661 --> 00:36:06,597
that's sweet
and innocent anymore, okay?

479
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,567
Listen, stop, stop, stop.

480
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:10,934
I'm sorry.

481
00:36:12,302 --> 00:36:14,438
I'm sorry
that we have to do this, okay?

482
00:36:14,905 --> 00:36:17,675
I'm sorry for whatever's
going on in your head or at home

483
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:20,411
and whatever, okay, but the best
advice I can give you...

484
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,917
Just... Just try
to have fun, okay?

485
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:29,385
Let's go make you a drink.

486
00:36:29,418 --> 00:36:30,487
Okay.

487
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:31,755
Just loosen up.

488
00:36:31,788 --> 00:36:33,623
-Okay.
-It'll be good.

489
00:36:33,657 --> 00:36:35,392
-Okay.
-All right.

490
00:36:35,425 --> 00:36:36,594
Come on.

491
00:37:00,983 --> 00:37:02,786
So you ready to party?

492
00:37:03,987 --> 00:37:05,789
What should I make you?

493
00:37:05,822 --> 00:37:07,625
Something that'll make me...

494
00:37:10,994 --> 00:37:14,532
Look, I didn't know
that you guys were hookers.

495
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:17,668
Sorry, I'm not into it.

496
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,771
Just tell me
what you want to drink.

497
00:37:29,478 --> 00:37:30,814
I'm not a hooker.

498
00:37:32,949 --> 00:37:34,619
You're not a hooker?

499
00:37:34,818 --> 00:37:36,387
Then what are you?

500
00:37:36,952 --> 00:37:38,389
Screw you.

501
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:43,794
You don't even know me so
you have no right to judge me.

502
00:37:45,094 --> 00:37:47,497
I'm not judging you,
I'm just not into hookers.

503
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:49,266
I said I'm not a hooker.

504
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:51,868
Then why are you here?

505
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:53,271
Why are you here?

506
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:56,407
I'm here because
one of my best friends

507
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,775
is throwing a party.

508
00:37:57,807 --> 00:37:59,744
I had no clue that he hired you.

509
00:38:01,711 --> 00:38:03,480
Well I really
need to the money.

510
00:38:03,847 --> 00:38:05,383
You need the money.

511
00:38:06,016 --> 00:38:07,451
So you're just willing to...

512
00:38:07,483 --> 00:38:08,985
Listen I need the money.

513
00:38:09,518 --> 00:38:11,721
Come on, get a job.

514
00:38:11,755 --> 00:38:13,990
-I have a job.
-Then get another one.

515
00:38:14,023 --> 00:38:16,726
This isn't me okay.
You have no right to judge me.

516
00:38:17,059 --> 00:38:18,795
This is a one-time thing.

517
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:21,798
I'm doing this for one night.

518
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:54,465
You suck.

519
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,965
That is...

520
00:38:55,998 --> 00:38:57,634
That was close.

521
00:38:57,666 --> 00:38:58,935
I almost won.

522
00:38:59,536 --> 00:39:01,072
-Yeah.
-Okay.

523
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:04,708
It's a secret,
it's a secret, it's a secret.

524
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,076
What's under there?

525
00:39:06,643 --> 00:39:08,679
Got some chalk
on your belly.

526
00:39:10,045 --> 00:39:12,349
-Here you guys.
-That's a good start.

527
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,985
My God!

528
00:39:16,585 --> 00:39:19,756
Couldn't really spin on it.
So get naked.

529
00:39:20,023 --> 00:39:23,059
Pants. Pants.
It's a war.

530
00:39:23,092 --> 00:39:24,694
Depends
how you define winning.

531
00:39:31,534 --> 00:39:33,370
I'm gonna go...

532
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:44,682
There you are.

533
00:39:46,115 --> 00:39:47,684
Let me show you my room.

534
00:39:48,117 --> 00:39:50,019
I thought you were playing.

535
00:39:50,052 --> 00:39:52,589
Nah, this is more fun.

536
00:41:32,856 --> 00:41:33,891
This is it.

537
00:41:33,923 --> 00:41:35,626
That was nice.

538
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:36,693
I almost got it.

539
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:38,729
No, you didn't, but see
the whole problem is

540
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:40,264
you hit the 12 ball and...

541
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:41,298
Really close.

542
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:44,501
The cue ball is the one
you wanna start with.

543
00:41:44,833 --> 00:41:46,135
Nice...

544
00:41:46,802 --> 00:41:49,172
Michael, yes, finally. God.

545
00:41:49,204 --> 00:41:52,076
Where you been all my life, man?
I need a partner.

546
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:53,944
Look at these ladies.

547
00:42:00,016 --> 00:42:01,918
-How are you?
-Where's Joe and Jenny?

548
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:02,987
Who?

549
00:42:03,853 --> 00:42:05,255
I don't know man.
We were playing

550
00:42:05,288 --> 00:42:07,090
Joe took off
right in the middle of the game.

551
00:42:07,123 --> 00:42:08,992
Who cares about them?
Come join us.

552
00:42:10,092 --> 00:42:12,228
He must be
showing her around, partner.

553
00:42:12,262 --> 00:42:14,565
Why don't you enjoy
the house too?

554
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:16,800
Yes, yes.

555
00:42:16,833 --> 00:42:19,836
That's a fantastic idea, man.
See I'm depending on you.

556
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:21,738
This is really important, okay?

557
00:42:21,771 --> 00:42:23,974
Wear big balls.
Go.

558
00:42:30,914 --> 00:42:32,750
Yes. Yes.

559
00:42:34,617 --> 00:42:36,253
-Nice, ladies.
-We lost.

560
00:42:36,286 --> 00:42:37,921
-Well.
-Show the goods.

561
00:42:37,954 --> 00:42:39,657
What do you got,
what do you got for me?

562
00:42:46,829 --> 00:42:48,065
That's a good start.

563
00:42:49,331 --> 00:42:50,634
That's good too.

564
00:42:52,068 --> 00:42:53,836
You're gonna enjoy this.

565
00:42:54,304 --> 00:42:55,706
I guarantee it.

566
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:11,414
Yeah.

567
00:44:20,889 --> 00:44:23,092
Bad timing, buddy.

568
00:44:23,126 --> 00:44:24,662
We're getting busy here.

569
00:44:25,327 --> 00:44:27,730
Hey, can I...

570
00:44:29,865 --> 00:44:32,101
Can you what, man?
Spit it out.

571
00:44:32,367 --> 00:44:34,170
I kind of wanted
to bang her first.

572
00:44:37,407 --> 00:44:38,842
Lucky girl.

573
00:44:43,146 --> 00:44:44,381
You know what?

574
00:44:46,516 --> 00:44:48,052
My gift to you.

575
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:08,439
Don't be too nice.

576
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:12,742
Come on, let's go to a room.

577
00:45:13,175 --> 00:45:14,510
No, no, no, no, no.

578
00:45:14,543 --> 00:45:16,946
You stay here.
You use mine, okay?

579
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,182
I like that.

580
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:20,984
Get in there.

581
00:45:56,885 --> 00:45:59,355
-What are you staring at?
-I'm staring at a girl

582
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:01,224
who is obviously
in over her head.

583
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:08,932
I didn't ask for your help.

584
00:46:08,965 --> 00:46:10,534
I'm sorry, you're right.

585
00:46:10,967 --> 00:46:12,001
You're right.

586
00:46:12,969 --> 00:46:14,204
Do you want me to go
get Joe and Adam too?

587
00:46:14,503 --> 00:46:16,873
I was informed
about 30 minutes ago

588
00:46:16,905 --> 00:46:19,275
that tonight
is anything goes, so...

589
00:46:19,509 --> 00:46:21,443
I'd be more than happy
to go get them for you.

590
00:46:21,476 --> 00:46:24,114
They'd probably be willing
to come up here for a good time.

591
00:46:28,451 --> 00:46:32,422
Just so you know, I'm not
interested in sleeping with you.

592
00:46:36,391 --> 00:46:38,194
The feelings are mutual.

593
00:46:48,905 --> 00:46:50,340
-Devils.
-Devils.

594
00:47:02,351 --> 00:47:04,153
-Man.
-Alpha female.

595
00:47:04,186 --> 00:47:05,487
-The dominant.
-The dom.

596
00:47:05,521 --> 00:47:07,057
The dom. The dom.

597
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:09,459
It just depends.

598
00:47:30,579 --> 00:47:32,615
Rough is extra, baby.

599
00:47:43,458 --> 00:47:45,328
-You wanna get a room?
-Yeah.

600
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:53,302
Who is this creepy old dude?

601
00:47:54,403 --> 00:47:55,938
So now you're
talking to me?

602
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:59,208
I'm asking for information.
Doesn't mean I like you.

603
00:48:05,014 --> 00:48:06,950
It's Joe's great grandfather.

604
00:48:06,983 --> 00:48:08,018
Sr. Davenport.

605
00:48:09,318 --> 00:48:10,653
How do you know?

606
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:13,990
Joe had it hanging in his
bedroom when we were kids.

607
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:16,626
What a creep.

608
00:48:20,563 --> 00:48:23,099
Is the story true
about that girl Alice?

609
00:48:24,166 --> 00:48:25,635
And his great grandfather?

610
00:48:27,235 --> 00:48:30,273
-How do you know about that?
-The red headed girl told me.

611
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:38,315
From what Joe told me,
yeah, it's true.

612
00:48:39,282 --> 00:48:40,951
How'd she do it?

613
00:48:43,452 --> 00:48:46,123
Well, there's been
many theories, many stories.

614
00:48:50,226 --> 00:48:52,362
One time when Joe was
really drunk he told me

615
00:48:52,394 --> 00:48:55,231
that his dad had told him
what really happened.

616
00:48:59,302 --> 00:49:03,239
Alice and her sister were sold
to Joe's great grandfather

617
00:49:03,271 --> 00:49:06,143
by their uncle
to help repay a debt.

618
00:49:07,744 --> 00:49:10,646
Eventually Alice's sister
got sold off to another guy.

619
00:49:12,581 --> 00:49:16,385
And after years and years
of being enslaved here,

620
00:49:16,418 --> 00:49:18,621
Alice grew more
and more defiant.

621
00:50:03,699 --> 00:50:05,568
Look at that
delicate little rose over there.

622
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:08,672
I bet she costs
a sweet penny?

623
00:50:09,338 --> 00:50:11,307
Sweet and a neat
like a little bird.

624
00:50:12,842 --> 00:50:14,610
But I like mine
with some handle.

625
00:50:14,643 --> 00:50:16,412
I'll be collecting
for all that grabbing.

626
00:50:16,445 --> 00:50:18,248
You'll be collecting
for more than that.

627
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,516
Let me see how mean
she really is.

628
00:50:31,327 --> 00:50:33,263
Hello, little lady.

629
00:50:35,297 --> 00:50:37,133
I said hello, little lady.

630
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:39,135
Stupid whore!

631
00:50:39,501 --> 00:50:40,737
Chain her.

632
00:50:43,338 --> 00:50:46,108
Don't forget, I own you.

633
00:50:51,746 --> 00:50:54,550
I apologize.
This visit is free.

634
00:50:56,652 --> 00:50:58,221
Thank you.

635
00:50:59,521 --> 00:51:02,192
Come on, baby, don't be sad.

636
00:51:02,224 --> 00:51:03,525
I'll take care of you.

637
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:05,162
Let's go upstairs.

638
00:51:20,576 --> 00:51:23,146
You've got a full night's work.
Unchain her.

639
00:53:14,556 --> 00:53:16,192
What a way to go.

640
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:18,695
Pretty heavy stuff?

641
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,703
You must think
I'm a real asshole

642
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:29,338
to be friends with him?

643
00:53:31,273 --> 00:53:33,609
Yeah.
Pretty much.

644
00:53:38,514 --> 00:53:40,250
You know I built that myself.

645
00:53:41,817 --> 00:53:43,219
You made this?

646
00:53:43,818 --> 00:53:44,954
No.

647
00:53:55,931 --> 00:53:58,034
Where are you going?
Snooping in Joe's underwear?

648
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:05,976
-You all right?
-Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

649
00:54:07,309 --> 00:54:08,577
I need to sit down.

650
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:10,480
-You okay?
-Yeah.

651
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:12,914
Do you feel weak?

652
00:54:12,947 --> 00:54:14,451
-A little bit.
-Here, sit down.

653
00:54:18,353 --> 00:54:19,688
You okay?

654
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:26,561
What's wrong?

655
00:54:26,594 --> 00:54:28,297
I just feel kind of dizzy.

656
00:54:28,864 --> 00:54:30,766
All right just rest.
Rest.

657
00:54:35,403 --> 00:54:37,039
Yeah, this is the one.

658
00:54:37,072 --> 00:54:38,507
No, no, no, no.

659
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:39,943
Mood lighting, baby.

660
00:54:41,677 --> 00:54:43,379
Why can't you
keep that one on?

661
00:54:43,411 --> 00:54:46,348
-Just leave that one on.
-Okay, that's cool.

662
00:54:56,391 --> 00:54:57,527
Yeah.

663
00:55:22,684 --> 00:55:24,420
What was that?

664
00:55:24,452 --> 00:55:25,554
What?

665
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:27,056
Do you hear that?

666
00:55:27,088 --> 00:55:29,326
I didn't hear anything.

667
00:55:30,693 --> 00:55:32,362
Just relax.

668
00:55:52,547 --> 00:55:53,916
Do you hear that?

669
00:55:57,619 --> 00:55:58,755
I don't hear anything.

670
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:00,989
Okay, just relax.

671
00:56:02,824 --> 00:56:04,126
I feel so weird.

672
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:05,661
You feel weird?

673
00:56:05,693 --> 00:56:07,029
It's the weed, baby.

674
00:56:29,985 --> 00:56:32,489
What the hell are you doing?

675
00:56:44,733 --> 00:56:47,036
I'm not gonna ask you
any more questions

676
00:56:47,068 --> 00:56:48,904
about why you're here.
Okay?

677
00:56:49,905 --> 00:56:51,040
Thanks.

678
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:53,643
No problem.

679
00:57:00,215 --> 00:57:02,418
Was that you
screaming, Jennifer?

680
00:57:03,085 --> 00:57:04,987
Hey, don't use up
all your energy.

681
00:57:05,554 --> 00:57:07,190
<i>Remember, it's my turn next.</i>

682
00:57:07,222 --> 00:57:08,458
What do you mean?

683
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:11,226
Woo, yeah!

684
00:57:12,594 --> 00:57:14,029
Yeah, baby!

685
00:57:14,063 --> 00:57:15,932
Right there!

686
00:57:15,965 --> 00:57:17,133
Yeah.

687
00:57:20,735 --> 00:57:22,504
You think they're screwing?

688
00:57:23,972 --> 00:57:25,175
We'll top 'em.

689
00:57:30,545 --> 00:57:31,847
We'll top 'em.

690
00:57:32,947 --> 00:57:35,083
-Nice work.
-Good prank.

691
00:57:36,784 --> 00:57:37,953
You wanna drink?

692
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:39,222
Yeah.

693
00:57:40,856 --> 00:57:42,959
Natasha.
Natasha.

694
00:57:42,992 --> 00:57:44,827
Where are you going?

695
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:45,995
What's wrong?

696
00:57:47,963 --> 00:57:49,065
I'm...

697
00:57:51,967 --> 00:57:53,936
Are you seeing stuff?

698
00:57:53,969 --> 00:57:55,204
No.

699
00:57:57,005 --> 00:57:58,141
I think...

700
00:57:59,175 --> 00:58:01,845
I think I just need
a cold bath or something.

701
00:58:02,545 --> 00:58:04,514
That's sexy.

702
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:06,483
You know what,
there's a nice bathtub.

703
00:58:06,715 --> 00:58:08,617
You want me to run you a bath?

704
00:58:09,184 --> 00:58:10,786
That sounds very nice.

705
00:58:10,818 --> 00:58:12,153
Yeah.
Okay.

706
00:58:12,186 --> 00:58:13,822
Okay, let's do that.

707
00:58:16,291 --> 00:58:19,496
-Have fun, guys.
-Yeah, you too. Jesus.

708
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:23,500
So, what are we gonna do?

709
00:58:23,898 --> 00:58:25,501
What do you wanna do?

710
00:58:26,034 --> 00:58:27,302
Let's go upstairs.

711
00:58:27,335 --> 00:58:28,538
Let's go.

712
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:29,771
You got it.

713
00:58:33,242 --> 00:58:34,877
Do you believe in ghosts?

714
00:58:34,909 --> 00:58:36,045
Nope.

715
00:58:36,978 --> 00:58:38,247
Why not?

716
00:58:39,148 --> 00:58:41,184
I thought you said
no more questions.

717
00:58:42,784 --> 00:58:44,086
I lied.

718
00:58:45,753 --> 00:58:47,789
Guess I can forgive you.

719
00:58:47,822 --> 00:58:48,958
Thank you.

720
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:50,293
Next question.

721
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,096
Favorite color?

722
00:58:54,128 --> 00:58:56,766
Favorite color.

723
00:58:56,798 --> 00:58:58,001
Really?

724
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:00,803
Come on, we gotta talk
about something,

725
00:59:00,835 --> 00:59:02,671
I'm not just gonna
sit here in silence.

726
00:59:02,704 --> 00:59:03,773
Fine.

727
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:05,742
Blue, I guess.

728
00:59:07,009 --> 00:59:08,110
Me too.

729
00:59:08,811 --> 00:59:10,079
You copycat.

730
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,848
Copycat.

731
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,650
Favorite...

732
00:59:14,983 --> 00:59:16,152
food.

733
00:59:16,684 --> 00:59:18,186
Favorite food it's tough.

734
00:59:18,219 --> 00:59:19,621
It's tough.

735
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:23,659
'Cause I got like pizza,
chocolate, sushi...

736
00:59:23,692 --> 00:59:25,226
You have to pick one.

737
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:26,896
So you're making up
the rules now?

738
00:59:28,664 --> 00:59:29,832
Sushi.

739
00:59:30,231 --> 00:59:31,634
Predictable.

740
00:59:32,668 --> 00:59:34,336
-I am not predictable.
-Yeah, you are.

741
00:59:34,369 --> 00:59:36,271
-Come on.
-You are so predictable.

742
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:38,374
Okay.

743
00:59:39,407 --> 00:59:40,643
Try me.

744
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:42,912
All right.
All right.

745
00:59:43,177 --> 00:59:44,580
Okay.

746
00:59:46,081 --> 00:59:48,651
You're parents
are happily married,

747
00:59:48,684 --> 00:59:51,220
you've got three
strapping brothers

748
00:59:51,253 --> 00:59:53,689
who are your best friends.

749
00:59:53,722 --> 00:59:56,826
You're mom's a homemaker,
dad's a lawyer,

750
00:59:57,259 --> 00:59:59,695
and mommy loved to make
her growing boys peach pie

751
00:59:59,728 --> 01:00:01,898
on the weekends...

752
01:00:02,398 --> 01:00:04,033
Stop.

753
01:00:04,065 --> 01:00:05,167
Just stop.

754
01:00:07,869 --> 01:00:08,971
No.

755
01:00:10,405 --> 01:00:11,708
No.

756
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:16,144
Actually, my parents got
divorced when I was nine.

757
01:00:17,679 --> 01:00:20,048
My dad is a lawyer,
you got that right.

758
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:23,720
But he moved to Chicago...

759
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,889
Married his 20 year younger
secretary

760
01:00:27,922 --> 01:00:30,025
and now has a new family.

761
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,896
I have an older
and a younger sister,

762
01:00:33,929 --> 01:00:36,231
and my mom's
an elementary school teacher.

763
01:00:36,264 --> 01:00:39,034
And I have never had peach pie.

764
01:00:43,338 --> 01:00:45,240
Do you ever see him?

765
01:00:45,273 --> 01:00:47,376
My dad?

766
01:00:48,376 --> 01:00:49,778
Not really.

767
01:00:52,748 --> 01:00:54,717
We don't have much in common.

768
01:00:57,753 --> 01:00:59,255
How about you?

769
01:01:00,021 --> 01:01:02,057
My favorite food of all time.

770
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:06,094
It's easy,
my grandma's Irish cooking.

771
01:01:07,128 --> 01:01:11,232
Stew with potatoes and carrots
and lamb, brown bread...

772
01:01:11,266 --> 01:01:13,101
I meant your family.

773
01:01:14,036 --> 01:01:15,804
It takes me back.

774
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,809
Is your grandma
around anymore?

775
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:22,878
No one's around anymore.

776
01:01:24,246 --> 01:01:25,981
It's just myself

777
01:01:26,014 --> 01:01:29,052
and my younger sister,
and she's eight.

778
01:01:34,155 --> 01:01:36,092
She's why you're here.

779
01:01:39,293 --> 01:01:40,362
Yeah.

780
01:01:43,097 --> 01:01:47,036
My dad, he left
after our mom died.

781
01:01:47,268 --> 01:01:52,407
My grandma, she passed
last year so it's just us.

782
01:01:53,242 --> 01:01:55,010
And when I work I have to find
someone to stay with her

783
01:01:55,043 --> 01:01:56,778
which doesn't always happen.

784
01:01:56,811 --> 01:01:59,481
So it's hard to go to school,
pay for school,

785
01:01:59,514 --> 01:02:03,085
keep a steady job, take care
of her and make ends meet.

786
01:02:06,088 --> 01:02:07,356
I'm sorry.

787
01:02:07,389 --> 01:02:09,092
No, don't be.

788
01:02:09,858 --> 01:02:11,961
What doesn't kill us
makes us stronger.

789
01:02:13,829 --> 01:02:16,199
I'll do whatever I have to do
to take care of her.

790
01:02:21,068 --> 01:02:23,005
I shouldn't have judged you.

791
01:02:23,371 --> 01:02:25,007
It's no biggie.

792
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:34,884
Is that why you don't
believe in ghosts?

793
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:36,318
What do you mean?

794
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:38,287
You mom and your grandma.

795
01:02:39,054 --> 01:02:41,490
Yeah, I guess. I mean...

796
01:02:42,456 --> 01:02:44,860
They'd come to me
if they could, right?

797
01:02:45,561 --> 01:02:46,829
Yeah.

798
01:02:48,463 --> 01:02:50,066
Maybe, I don't know.

799
01:02:51,432 --> 01:02:54,369
I feel like maybe spirits
get stuck sometimes.

800
01:02:54,402 --> 01:02:56,838
Like if they really want to...

801
01:02:56,871 --> 01:03:00,143
I don't want to talk
about it anymore, okay?

802
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:01,844
Yeah.

803
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:03,846
Yeah.

804
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:16,025
You're not gonna
sleep with them.

805
01:03:19,961 --> 01:03:21,563
Unless you want to.

806
01:03:26,534 --> 01:03:28,436
You're not really my type.

807
01:03:30,072 --> 01:03:31,240
Good.

808
01:03:56,530 --> 01:03:58,366
I'll be right there, baby.

809
01:03:59,067 --> 01:04:00,869
Yeah, yeah.

810
01:04:42,945 --> 01:04:44,380
It's killer weed.

811
01:04:45,514 --> 01:04:47,016
Proud of you.

812
01:05:24,552 --> 01:05:25,688
Boop.

813
01:05:27,322 --> 01:05:29,090
Hi, ladies.

814
01:05:30,592 --> 01:05:31,693
Hey.

815
01:05:32,327 --> 01:05:33,562
Get in there.

816
01:06:48,536 --> 01:06:49,739
Wait, wait.

817
01:06:57,711 --> 01:06:59,280
God damn.

818
01:07:31,246 --> 01:07:32,815
Hey, wake up.

819
01:07:47,262 --> 01:07:49,164
Hey.

820
01:07:49,463 --> 01:07:51,299
Come on. Come here.

821
01:08:01,775 --> 01:08:03,645
Hey, guys, don't mess around.

822
01:08:12,387 --> 01:08:13,622
Assholes.

823
01:09:12,413 --> 01:09:13,882
Here we go.

824
01:09:41,643 --> 01:09:43,311
Careful.

825
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:24,987
Hey Michael.

826
01:10:25,386 --> 01:10:26,287
We're busy.

827
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:30,524
-Hey man, you want a drink?
-No, we're busy.

828
01:10:30,557 --> 01:10:32,293
Find another hoe.

829
01:10:32,327 --> 01:10:33,628
You're not a hoe.

830
01:10:35,596 --> 01:10:36,798
Okay.

831
01:10:42,936 --> 01:10:44,939
What are they doing out there?

832
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:50,411
Joe and them
get a little crazy sometimes.

833
01:10:50,444 --> 01:10:52,247
They've been really loud.

834
01:10:52,747 --> 01:10:54,483
I feel so messed up.

835
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:57,386
I feel great.

836
01:10:57,418 --> 01:10:59,755
No, I think we're like
really messed up, Michael.

837
01:10:59,787 --> 01:11:01,956
The room is, like, moving.

838
01:11:02,990 --> 01:11:04,760
It is moving.

839
01:11:07,929 --> 01:11:11,300
What a freaking party.

840
01:11:19,474 --> 01:11:20,743
What was that?

841
01:11:21,943 --> 01:11:23,279
Sorry.

842
01:11:23,610 --> 01:11:24,846
Don't be.

843
01:11:48,670 --> 01:11:51,707
<i>Natasha.</i>

844
01:11:53,975 --> 01:11:56,945
<i>Natasha.</i>

845
01:11:59,713 --> 01:12:00,849
Natasha!

846
01:12:00,881 --> 01:12:02,650
No! No!

847
01:12:33,881 --> 01:12:34,882
Joe.

848
01:12:36,850 --> 01:12:38,052
Hey man.

849
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:40,355
Hey, what the hell.

850
01:12:41,422 --> 01:12:42,623
Hey, hey.

851
01:12:43,024 --> 01:12:44,827
I don't know what's going on.

852
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:47,596
-There's...
-Where's Anita?

853
01:12:47,628 --> 01:12:49,030
I don't know.
I don't know.

854
01:12:55,502 --> 01:12:57,805
<i>Natasha.</i>

855
01:13:05,579 --> 01:13:08,117
<i>Natasha.</i>

856
01:13:33,875 --> 01:13:36,177
-Where's Anita?
-We were in the tub

857
01:13:36,845 --> 01:13:39,481
and then
there was this... This...

858
01:13:39,980 --> 01:13:41,082
God!

859
01:13:41,783 --> 01:13:43,552
No! No!

860
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:44,619
Help.

861
01:13:45,686 --> 01:13:47,021
Leave me alone.

862
01:13:50,024 --> 01:13:51,460
Just leave me alone.

863
01:14:06,573 --> 01:14:08,443
What the hell are you doing?

864
01:14:10,979 --> 01:14:12,146
What the hell are you doing?

865
01:14:13,648 --> 01:14:15,050
What are you doing, man?

866
01:14:40,707 --> 01:14:42,978
Have you lost your mind?

867
01:15:00,194 --> 01:15:01,697
What's going on down here?

868
01:15:02,564 --> 01:15:05,000
What the hell happened?
What happened?

869
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:06,168
Zeke!

870
01:15:10,137 --> 01:15:11,907
No! No!

871
01:15:15,076 --> 01:15:17,613
Jennifer! Run!

872
01:15:49,277 --> 01:15:51,279
I own you, whore.

873
01:15:51,311 --> 01:15:55,650
<i>Joe, come to me, Joe.</i>

874
01:16:00,921 --> 01:16:05,560
<i>Joe, come to me.</i>
