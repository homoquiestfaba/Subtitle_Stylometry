00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:50,135
Oh, we'll give you two.
She's dying for one.

178
00:11:50,136 --> 00:11:51,887
No, really. I...

179
00:11:53,638 --> 00:11:55,806
$5.50, Mrs Moochmore.

180
00:11:55,807 --> 00:11:58,017
But I... I don't want it.

181
00:11:58,018 --> 00:12:02,273
What are you talking about?
Gone to all this trouble.

182
00:12:04,566 --> 00:12:06,819
Enjoying that, Mrs Moochmore?

183
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,028
Oh, yes, thank you.

184
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,196
You want another one?

185
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:14,324
Oh... no, thank you.

186
00:12:14,325 --> 00:12:16,076
Moo.

187
00:12:16,077 --> 00:12:17,670
- What?
- Shirley.

188
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:20,122
- Mm? Oh!
- What are you doing?

189
00:12:20,123 --> 00:12:24,592
You promised me no more fattening foods.
Don't you care about your health?

190
00:12:24,593 --> 00:12:26,712
- I do. I do.

191
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:29,089
Well, if you don't care,
how do you expect me to care?

192
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,559
Oh, I do care. And I care that you care.

193
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,095
I brought the girls.
They've just been glazed.

194
00:12:35,096 --> 00:12:36,847
Oh.

195
00:12:39,768 --> 00:12:42,394
Elizabeth the 1st.

196
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:44,271
For the competition.

197
00:12:44,272 --> 00:12:47,441
I'm doing Elizabeth the 1st.

198
00:12:47,442 --> 00:12:50,571
Now, feel Miriam's hair.

199
00:12:51,613 --> 00:12:53,781
Go on.

200
00:12:53,782 --> 00:12:55,699
Nylon.

201
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,247
Now feel Yvette's.

202
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,454
Feel the difference?

203
00:13:00,455 --> 00:13:01,997
Human.

204
00:13:01,998 --> 00:13:05,667
I want to do Elizabeth the 1st
with human hair.

205
00:13:05,668 --> 00:13:08,262
Red human hair.

206
00:13:09,506 --> 00:13:13,886
Do you think, um, Jane would like
to visit me this afternoon?

207
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:17,932
Jane? Oh, I'm sure she would.

208
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:21,391
I'll pick her up after school, then.

209
00:13:21,392 --> 00:13:23,609
<i>You know, I think I will have cream.</i>

210
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:26,106
I don't think Barry loves me anymore.

211
00:13:26,107 --> 00:13:28,899
What? Well, did Barry say that?

212
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,528
Well, then, how do you know?

213
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:34,782
He never looks at me.

214
00:13:35,824 --> 00:13:37,826
He never says anything to me.

215
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,331
He hasn't come home for two weeks.

216
00:13:41,332 --> 00:13:43,295
Barry's got a lot on his mind
these days,

217
00:13:43,296 --> 00:13:45,085
what with the election coming up.

218
00:13:45,086 --> 00:13:47,962
I don't blame him
for not loving me anymore.

219
00:13:49,003 --> 00:13:52,301
- I know I've let myself go.
- Oh, no, stop that.

220
00:13:52,302 --> 00:13:55,266
- I let the girls run wild.
- Well, I've always said that.

221
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,558
I remind people of garbage.

222
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:59,680
- Who does?
- I do!

223
00:13:59,681 --> 00:14:02,307
My bins do.

224
00:14:03,768 --> 00:14:07,441
Well, use that perfume I gave you
for Christmas - that L'Air du Temps.

225
00:14:07,442 --> 00:14:09,111
No, enough of that.

226
00:14:09,112 --> 00:14:12,234
Uh... have another doughnut.

227
00:14:12,235 --> 00:14:14,827
You said I shouldn't eat
any more doughnuts.

228
00:14:14,828 --> 00:14:17,665
Well, if it cheers you up,
you can have a dozen doughnuts.

229
00:14:17,666 --> 00:14:19,908
She'll have another doughnut.

230
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:21,451
Jam and cream?

231
00:14:21,452 --> 00:14:23,495
Uh, yes, why not?

232
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:25,247
My treat.

233
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:30,169
- Can't this wait till later?
- No!

234
00:14:31,713 --> 00:14:35,841
No. Well... I'm sure everything's fine.

235
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:39,011
It's not fine!

236
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:41,638
I feel like I don't exist!

237
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,981
- Of course you exist. Everyone exists.
- I don't!

238
00:14:43,982 --> 00:14:46,726
I sit here
and I eat doughnuts I don't want!

239
00:14:46,727 --> 00:14:49,570
Now get a grip on yourself!
Stop this spectacle. Hmm?

240
00:14:49,571 --> 00:14:52,315
Why don't you go shopping?
That always cheers me up.

241
00:14:52,316 --> 00:14:55,787
You just go shopping and you keep
shopping until you cheer up.

242
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:01,533
Michelle.

243
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:04,244
Give us the mechanical man.

244
00:15:04,245 --> 00:15:06,166
I don't have the mechanical man!

245
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:07,962
Give us the mechanical man.

246
00:15:07,963 --> 00:15:09,750
Argh!

247
00:15:09,751 --> 00:15:12,753
Michelle, do you want a couch'? A couch.

248
00:15:12,754 --> 00:15:14,796
It's a lovely white couch.

249
00:15:14,797 --> 00:15:16,924
Oh, she doesn't want it.

250
00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:19,927
Why didn't you tell me
your father had won Wheel Of Fortune?

251
00:15:19,928 --> 00:15:22,932
Darling, don't lie in here
with the lights off. It's not normal.

252
00:15:34,442 --> 00:15:37,992
Dolphin Heads Council, Mayor
Moochmore's office. Tisha speakin'.

253
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:45,621
Kylie, I've already warned youse twice.
One more time...

254
00:15:45,622 --> 00:15:50,751
- Barry! I mean... Mayor Moochmore.

255
00:15:52,377 --> 00:15:55,337
There's an emergency. At home.

256
00:15:55,338 --> 00:15:58,433
It's an Excelsior! Oh!

257
00:15:59,717 --> 00:16:04,054
It's the vacuum cleaner I've always w...
And it's purple! Oh!

258
00:16:04,055 --> 00:16:06,602
Oh, my goodness!
Another washing machine!

259
00:16:06,603 --> 00:16:08,818
Oh! Put it right there with the others.
Thank you.

260
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:10,352
- Mum...
- Yes.

261
00:16:10,353 --> 00:16:12,854
- I'm scared.
- Oh, don't be silly, darling.

262
00:16:12,855 --> 00:16:16,528
Does anyone on TV look scared when
their fathers win the Wheel Of Fortune?

263
00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:20,199
Of course not. They're happy
someone invented game shows.

264
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,702
And when your dad gets home,
we are gonna celebrate with dinner...

265
00:16:24,703 --> 00:16:26,702
...on our new table!

266
00:16:26,703 --> 00:16:28,829
Oh! Look! There's Nancy Boyle!

267
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:33,458
Nancy, hello! Hello!
Look at all the furniture!

268
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:35,587
It's alright.
You don't have to be afraid of it.

269
00:16:35,588 --> 00:16:38,338
It's not rubbish. It's all new.

270
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:39,884
Fabulously new from my husband.

271
00:16:39,885 --> 00:16:42,383
He calls you 'Noxious Nance'
behind your back, he does.

272
00:16:42,384 --> 00:16:44,181
He says you're a nasty, gossiping bitch.

273
00:16:44,182 --> 00:16:47,398
But I think that's unfair, because
you've done a lot for this community -

274
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:52,060
or at least act like you have -
so I want you to have this lamp.

275
00:16:52,061 --> 00:16:55,315
Is you oldest daughter really a lesbian
or is that just malicious gossip?

276
00:16:55,316 --> 00:16:58,942
Oh! He's here! We've done it!

277
00:16:58,943 --> 00:17:01,945
He's home! Your father's home!

278
00:17:01,946 --> 00:17:03,491
Quickly, start singing!

Jane! Get away from that!

288
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,066
It's goin' back to the shops.

289

I'm Kayleen.

290
00:17:40,818 --> 00:17:43,412
Make sure you leave the kettle on
the whole time...

291
00:17:43,413 --> 00:17:44,951
Bastard.

292
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:56,213
Sit at the table, Dad.
We're getting you breakfast.

293
00:18:04,092 --> 00:18:05,969
Fresh and premium cold beer, Dad.

294
00:18:08,137 --> 00:18:09,855
Excuse me.

295
00:18:24,987 --> 00:18:29,032
Your mum is on holiday in Wollongong,

296
00:18:29,033 --> 00:18:31,832
and she's having a wonderful time.

297
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,248
If anybody asks, that's the story.
You got it?

298
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:47,217
Dad, we were thinking,

299
00:18:47,218 --> 00:18:48,885
while Mum's away,

300
00:18:48,886 --> 00:18:51,596
maybe we should be seeing somebody.

301
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:53,349
You know, like a psychiatrist.

302
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:56,893
- What?
- Someone to talk to about our problems.

303
00:18:56,894 --> 00:18:59,896
- What?
- So we don't end up in Wollongong.

304
00:18:59,897 --> 00:19:02,649
- What?
- Dad, I'm autistic.

305
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:05,197
Dad, I'm a sociopath.
I don't feel anything.

306
00:19:05,198 --> 00:19:07,322
- I'm pre-psychotic.
- Michelle hears voices.

307
00:19:07,323 --> 00:19:09,948
- What?
- Tell Dad you hear voices.

308
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:11,491
I hear voices.

309
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,417
Auntie Doris stole my hair!

310
00:19:20,418 --> 00:19:21,965
Enough!

311
00:19:24,005 --> 00:19:28,053
There are no psychiatrists in Dolphin
Heads anywhere but the loony bin.

312
00:19:28,054 --> 00:19:32,724
And the only person in this family
going to the loony bin is your mother!

313
00:19:32,725 --> 00:19:35,473
This wouldn't be happening to me
if I had a family of boys.

314
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:37,020
Boys have breakdowns, Dad.

315
00:19:37,021 --> 00:19:40,566
Not Australian boys -
they're too busy playing football.

316
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:42,108
Now, I've got an election to run,

317
00:19:42,109 --> 00:19:45,278
and I don't care if you five lumps
eat me out of house and home

318
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,153
and spend every cent I make -

319
00:19:47,154 --> 00:19:50,280
no-one is going mental.

320
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:53,200
Not before I do.

321
00:19:53,201 --> 00:19:55,827
I'm goin' mental!
I live in a barn, Jack.

322
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:58,750
There's pizza boxes piled everywhere
'cause none of 'em can cook.

323
00:19:58,751 --> 00:20:01,044
They can't do the dishes,
they don't make the beds.

324
00:20:01,045 --> 00:20:03,839
- It's a nightmare!
- Get Shirley back from her holiday.

325
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,883
- She can't come back.
- Why not? It's been over a week.

326
00:20:06,884 --> 00:20:09,507
Barry, you gotta level with me.
Has she left ya?

327
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:14,263
'Cause if she has, get her back'
Mate, we go to the polls in eight weeks.

328
00:20:14,264 --> 00:20:16,559
She's on all of the leaflets
with you and the girls.

329
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,527
She hasn't left me.
She's in Wollongong, and she likes it.

330
00:20:19,528 --> 00:20:21,692
I wish I was there meself.

331
00:20:25,733 --> 00:20:27,451
Nah.

332
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:33,624
Nah.

333
00:20:35,243 --> 00:20:37,211
Turn around and have another look.

334
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:42,542
Looks normal. Got a dog.

335
00:20:44,168 --> 00:20:45,710
Nah. I can't.

336
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:48,672
Hitchhiker... Nah.

337
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:51,758
Barry Moochmore.

338
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:54,603
<i>Dad,
I know you don't believe anything I say,</i>

339
00:20:54,604 --> 00:20:56,137
<i>but I'm a sociopath.</i>

340
00:20:56,138 --> 00:20:58,482
<i>- I don't have any feelings.
- Which one is this?</i>

341
00:20:58,483 --> 00:21:02,022
<i>It's Kayleen!
Why don't you ever remember my name?!</i>

342
00:21:02,023 --> 00:21:04,613
Look, don't worry about it.
I'm gonna fix everything.

343
00:21:18,452 --> 00:21:20,293
The embarrassment is total.

344
00:21:20,294 --> 00:21:23,256
I have to get some hats.
People are gawking at me.

345
00:21:23,257 --> 00:21:25,249
<i>What does your dad think?</i>

346
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,175
Dad thinks 12-year-olds
don't know anything, but they do.

347
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,633
<i>Jane?</i>

348
00:21:33,634 --> 00:21:35,386
Don't make any sudden moves.

349
00:21:36,971 --> 00:21:38,814
Ripper! Come 'ere!

350
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:44,352
I didn't train him to kill.

351
00:21:44,353 --> 00:21:46,229
He does it out of love.

352
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,773
'Course he only kills for me.

353
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:52,527
If someone attacked you, he'd watch.

354
00:21:54,071 --> 00:21:56,781
Is... is my dad here?

355
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,375
In the back room.

356
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:01,875
Wouldn't have paid for that haircut
if I was you.

357
00:22:03,706 --> 00:22:05,874
Brother! It's Barry.

358
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,376
Dad, who's that woman?

359
00:22:08,377 --> 00:22:13,173
Oh, I forget her name, but you are
to do everything she tells ya.

360
00:22:13,174 --> 00:22:14,890
Nah, nah, everything's jake.

361
00:22:14,891 --> 00:22:17,260
I took your advice
and got meself a babysitter.

362
00:22:17,261 --> 00:22:19,263
Yeah, hired her on the way home.

363
00:22:19,264 --> 00:22:21,139
She can live in, too.

364
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:24,434
Ah. Oi. She's staying in your room.

365
00:22:24,435 --> 00:22:27,029
- Where will I sleep?
- You share with Jane.

366
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,688
<i>I am Jane.</i>

367
00:22:28,689 --> 00:22:30,610
I don't care about that anymore.

368
00:22:30,611 --> 00:22:32,700
Tell your problems to what's-her-name.

369
00:22:32,701 --> 00:22:36,448
Feel like a beer, mate?
Great! I'll see you in ten minutes.

370
00:22:36,449 --> 00:22:40,575
I don't have the mechanical man!

371
00:22:40,576 --> 00:22:42,123
Fair enough.

372
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:49,793
That's Michelle. She's mental.

373
00:22:49,794 --> 00:22:51,387
We all are.

374
00:22:53,589 --> 00:22:55,466
I'll be the judge of that.

375
00:23:02,306 --> 00:23:03,973
What are you doing?

376
00:23:03,974 --> 00:23:06,068
- Coral!
- She's making us clean!

377
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:07,602
- Who is?
- Shaz!

378
00:23:07,603 --> 00:23:09,148
- Her dog's crazy.
- Whose dog?

379
00:23:09,149 --> 00:23:11,442
Shaz's dog.
It's gonna kill us if we stop cleaning.

380
00:23:11,443 --> 00:23:13,281
You're the oldest, Coral.
Get rid of her.

381
00:23:13,282 --> 00:23:17,655
She's in there. She's got a knife.
I saw it sticking out of her boot.

382
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:31,545
Gawww!  Not bad.

383
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,223
Who are you?

384
00:23:38,217 --> 00:23:40,927
- Coral.
- Oh, like the sea.

385
00:23:40,928 --> 00:23:43,638
The Coral Sea.

386
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:46,808
I'm Shaz. Just... Shaz.

387
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:49,858
<i>'I'm Shaz.'
'I'm tough.'</i>

388
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:51,688
- Ripper!

389
00:23:56,944 --> 00:23:58,491
What are you doing here?

390
00:24:02,032 --> 00:24:05,286
I'm here to fulfil me destiny.

391
00:24:06,495 --> 00:24:08,338
Right a grievous wrong.

392
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:14,461
See the sights.

393
00:24:14,462 --> 00:24:16,921
Where's ya mum, by the way?

394
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:18,390
She's...

395
00:24:19,967 --> 00:24:21,765
In Wollongong?

396
00:24:23,637 --> 00:24:25,889
On holiday.

397
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:28,063
Havin' a wonderful time.

398
00:24:29,894 --> 00:24:32,693
I'm not scared of you.
I work in a shark show.

399
00:24:32,694 --> 00:24:34,230
You're kiddin'.

400
00:24:34,231 --> 00:24:38,485
They're dead,
but... one of them ate Harold Holt.

401
00:24:48,871 --> 00:24:52,874
Don't worry, love.
It would've been quick.

402
00:25:39,797 --> 00:25:42,425
- Patchouli oil?
- She's a hippie.

403
00:25:51,392 --> 00:25:53,110
It's pretend.

404
00:26:00,776 --> 00:26:05,530
Hmm... 'Di... dis... agnosum...'

405
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:08,751
'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders'.

406
00:26:09,785 --> 00:26:14,330
Maybe she's a psychiatrist,
like we wished for.

407
00:26:14,331 --> 00:26:16,332
G'day.

408
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:18,506
Sharon Thornbender.
All the way from Tassie.

409
00:26:18,507 --> 00:26:23,423
Nancy. Nancy Boyle.
This is my daughter - Donna.

410
00:26:23,424 --> 00:26:25,265
Jeez, you're a big one,
aren't ya, Donna?

411
00:26:25,266 --> 00:26:27,100
Which house did you say
you'd moved into?

412
00:26:27,101 --> 00:26:30,724
I didn't. You'll have to invite me in
for a cuppa tea, won't ya?

413
00:26:30,725 --> 00:26:32,515
Already been next door.

414
00:26:32,516 --> 00:26:35,101
The Moochmores?

415
00:26:35,102 --> 00:26:37,353
Could I tell you stories!

416
00:26:37,354 --> 00:26:42,775
Once I saw Shirley Moochmore
standing outside in their backyard...

417
00:26:42,776 --> 00:26:44,652
...screaming.

418
00:26:44,653 --> 00:26:46,195
No!

419
00:26:46,196 --> 00:26:50,575
Her screaming's better
than her singing, though. Ugh!

420
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:52,118
Close your legs.

421
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:53,962
She brought it on herself,
in my opinion.

422
00:26:55,539 --> 00:26:58,839
'Course those girls, they're enough
to drive anyone around the bend.

423
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,758
But who let them get that way?

424
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:05,798
- She did.
- Mm.

425
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:07,634
- Legs.
- Yeah.

426
00:27:07,635 --> 00:27:10,929
Once, um...
once they bought this pool...

427
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,514
- Oh! This is...

428
00:27:13,515 --> 00:27:16,976
No... No, this...

429
00:27:16,977 --> 00:27:19,479
This is terrible!

430
00:27:21,315 --> 00:27:23,989
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
You can't tell her that!

431
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:26,027
- I won't!
- You can't!

432
00:27:26,028 --> 00:27:29,364
They got this upright pool...

433
00:27:29,365 --> 00:27:33,534
- ..and they put it in their backyard,

434
00:27:33,535 --> 00:27:36,036
and... and their backyards on a slant.

435
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,215
So all the Moochmores, they all get in.

436
00:27:41,757 --> 00:27:43,670
And then...

437
00:27:43,671 --> 00:27:46,422
Not all of them - not Barry of course,
'cause you never see him.

438
00:27:46,423 --> 00:27:51,020
But because it's on a slant, they just
go, like, washing to one side...

439
00:27:54,014 --> 00:27:56,686
And then the side...

440
00:27:56,687 --> 00:27:59,779
- And the side just, like, breaks...
- Side breaks!

441
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:09,404
So they just spill out,
all over the yard.

442
00:28:09,405 --> 00:28:12,452
- And they float...
- Rolling out like a bunch of bananas!

443
00:28:12,453 --> 00:28:16,044
Shirley Moochmore. Ugh!
She just starts screaming again!

444
00:28:16,045 --> 00:28:20,957
It's like living next door
to an Aboriginal encampment.

445
00:28:20,958 --> 00:28:23,668
'Cause Mum hates Abos.

446
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:26,879
And where is Shirley Moochmore
these days?

447
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,974
There's the million-dollar question.

448
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:44,981
In all me life, I have never
witnessed a sorrier display.

449
00:28:48,652 --> 00:28:49,861
Yep'

450
00:28:49,862 --> 00:28:51,954
- Shirley?
- Nup. Who's this?

451
00:28:51,955 --> 00:28:53,913
This is Doris Charles speaking.

452
00:28:53,914 --> 00:28:56,251
Ah. Would this be Auntie Doris Charles?

453
00:28:56,252 --> 00:28:59,328
Who is this?

454
00:28:59,329 --> 00:29:00,876
This is Auntie Shaz speakin'.

455
00:29:00,877 --> 00:29:03,291
Auntie Shaz?

456
00:29:03,292 --> 00:29:05,626
I didn't know Barry had a sister.

457
00:29:05,627 --> 00:29:08,253
Yeah, well, I'm more the auntie ya earn
than the other kind.

458
00:29:08,254 --> 00:29:11,930
- What other kind?
- Your kind. The hairdressin' kind.

459
00:29:13,093 --> 00:29:14,635
I'm not a hairdresser.

460
00:29:14,636 --> 00:29:18,140
Oh, Well, you'd better give Jane
her hair back, then, hadn't ya?

461
00:29:19,183 --> 00:29:21,517
- OK. Another one.

462
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,028
It's still me.

463
00:29:32,863 --> 00:29:35,082
You know what they say about youse
in this town?

464
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:37,658
Hmm? They say youse are freaks.

465
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:39,994
They say you don't belong.

466
00:29:39,995 --> 00:29:45,291
They say you're good-for-nothing
layabouts who'll never achieve nothin'.

467
00:29:45,292 --> 00:29:48,134
If someone said that about me,
I'd cut their throats.

468
00:29:48,135 --> 00:29:50,426
Why aren't youse out there
cuttin' their throats?

469
00:29:50,427 --> 00:29:53,841
- Because it's true.

470
00:29:53,842 --> 00:29:56,061
There's someone outside watchin' us.

471
00:30:04,728 --> 00:30:06,854
- This'll be good.
- Hello?

472
00:30:06,855 --> 00:30:08,402
Hello?

473
00:30:08,403 --> 00:30:10,566
- Hello?
- Hello?

474
00:30:10,567 --> 00:30:12,114
- Hello?!

475
00:30:12,115 --> 00:30:15,456
- I think they hung up.
- Michelle...

476
00:30:16,573 --> 00:30:18,746
...you're holdin' the phone
the wrong way, darl.

477
00:30:18,747 --> 00:30:20,284
'Ello'?

478
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:23,079
- Michelle?
- Yeah?

479
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,629
- Can you talk?
- Yeah.

480
00:30:27,251 --> 00:30:30,169
It's Auntie Doris.
ls everything alright?

481
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,923
Oh. Is that you outside in the car?

482
00:30:34,508 --> 00:30:36,050
Where's your mother?

483
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:40,138
- On holiday.
- On holiday? Well, where's Barry?

484
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:42,187
- Where's your father?
- I dunno.

485
00:30:42,188 --> 00:30:44,308
He's never 'ere, is he?

486
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,403
Maybe he's dead
and they forgot to tell us.

487
00:30:49,022 --> 00:30:53,243
Can you see me at the window?
I'm wavin' at ya. Why don't you come in?

488
00:30:53,244 --> 00:30:55,903
No. No, I can't come in.

489
00:30:55,904 --> 00:30:58,828
She never comes in.
She thinks we're pigs.

490
00:31:00,075 --> 00:31:02,285
- Really?
- We're not pigs now.

491
00:31:02,286 --> 00:31:04,880
It's all tidy in here. See?

492
00:31:05,914 --> 00:31:08,374
Did you break down or something?

493
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:10,924
We could come out and give you a push.

494
00:31:13,297 --> 00:31:15,764
Michelle! Look, who is this Shaz woman?!

495
00:31:15,765 --> 00:31:18,886
G'day! Sharon Thornbender.
All the way from Tassie.

496
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:24,189
- Put it on speaker! Put it on speaker!
- Don't make any sudden moves, Doris.

497
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:26,183
He's checkin' to see
if you're a sex pervert.

498
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:29,906
Can't be too careful. And Ripper here
can sniff out a psycho at ten paces.

499
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,406
Oh! He doesn't like
the smell of you, Doris.

500
00:31:33,407 --> 00:31:35,992
- You're not a sex pervert, are ya?
- No.

501
00:31:35,993 --> 00:31:38,578
Then what are you doing
sitting out here in the dark, then?

502
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:40,870
Are you some old lezzie
on the prowl for young girls?

503
00:31:40,871 --> 00:31:42,825
Certainly not! I'm married.

504
00:31:42,826 --> 00:31:44,371
- Prove it.
- I have a ring.

505
00:31:44,372 --> 00:31:47,416
Oh, anyone coulda give you that.
Another lezzie coulda give ya that.

506
00:31:47,417 --> 00:31:50,666
You could be head of a coven of lezzies
masquerading as old married women.

507
00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:55,466
- Jesus! Ripper, they're in the back!
- No! They're my girls! Don't hurt them!

508
00:31:55,467 --> 00:31:57,009
- Oh!
- What are they?!

509
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:00,555
They're dolls! I make them for
competitions. They're very expensive.

510
00:32:00,556 --> 00:32:04,102
- Please... just get your dog off!
- Ripper, get off 'em.

511
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:08,144
Spun out! I thought they was weird
dwarves and you was their leader.

512
00:32:08,145 --> 00:32:10,394
I've won prizes for my dolls.

513
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:12,396
Gawd! Look at 'em starin'!

514
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,195
Cover 'em up! I'm gonna freak out!

515
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,616
You scalped Jane for one of 'em,
didn't ya?

516
00:32:20,617 --> 00:32:23,538
Your own niece,
so as you could win prizes.

517
00:32:23,539 --> 00:32:25,618
I had Shirley's permission.

518
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:27,870
Oh, Shirley said
you could chop off her daughter's hair,

519
00:32:27,871 --> 00:32:29,373
put it on some bald doll.

520
00:32:29,374 --> 00:32:31,040
How do you know Shirley?

521
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:32,884
Where is she?
What have you done with her?

522
00:32:32,885 --> 00:32:35,211
- She's in Wollongong.
- Oh.

523
00:32:35,212 --> 00:32:37,556
Been to Wollongong before, has she?

524
00:32:40,133 --> 00:32:44,387
Yep. I've been hearing a lot
about Shirley around here.

525
00:32:44,388 --> 00:32:47,731
None of it flatterin'. Sounds like
she was a shockin' housekeeper

526
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:50,145
but thought the world of her daughters,
that right'?

527
00:32:50,146 --> 00:32:51,859
It's hard to juggle a home and a family.

528
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,276
I mean, I should know -
I have two children myself.

529
00:32:54,277 --> 00:32:55,940
Do ya?

530
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:59,320
Some children are less trouble
than others, I reckon'

531
00:32:59,321 --> 00:33:02,989
I was lucky.
My children are naturally tidy.

532
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,740
Quiet too, I bet.

533
00:33:04,741 --> 00:33:08,369
Well... I was strict.

534
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:10,746
But children need that.

535
00:33:10,747 --> 00:33:15,042
I posted a daily roster
of their responsibilities.

536
00:33:15,043 --> 00:33:17,011
You sure you're Shirley's sister?

537
00:33:17,012 --> 00:33:19,297
We're ten years apart.

538
00:33:19,298 --> 00:33:22,768
I still think of Shirley
as the baby of the family -

539
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:25,428
the one who got away with everything.

540
00:33:25,429 --> 00:33:27,346
But she's a dear thing,

541
00:33:27,347 --> 00:33:30,099
with a sweet, trusting nature.

542
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:34,697
Yep. It's all comin' together.
The life of Shirley Moochmore.

543
00:33:37,816 --> 00:33:40,651
- Ripper!
- Oh!

544
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:44,577
I understand you, Doris.
And soon, you're gonna understand me.

545
00:33:44,578 --> 00:33:47,074
That sounds... ominous.

546
00:33:47,075 --> 00:33:49,248
You wouldn't know.

547
00:33:51,371 --> 00:33:53,414
Aargghhhh!

548
00:33:58,587 --> 00:34:00,588
Oh, shit. It's a mask.

549
00:34:00,589 --> 00:34:03,549
Did I scream?

550
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:07,011
Mm...

551
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:09,811
Seen me feminine side, Coral.

552
00:34:11,433 --> 00:34:13,726
Girls like that, don't they?

553
00:34:13,727 --> 00:34:16,020
It turns ya on, don't it?

554
00:34:16,021 --> 00:34:18,274
- Oh, it turns me on!

555
00:34:21,068 --> 00:34:23,527
I didn't think you liked me, Trout.

556
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:27,374
You let me see the sharks
after closin' time, didn't ya?

557
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:29,915
This is your reward.

558
00:34:31,286 --> 00:34:33,334
What do you like about me, Trout?

559
00:34:33,335 --> 00:34:34,872
What?

560
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:37,541
Uh... you're different.

561
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,251
How am I different?

562
00:34:39,252 --> 00:34:40,797
I dunno. It's... hard to say.

563
00:34:40,798 --> 00:34:43,720
Ya missin' something, or you got
too much of it. I don't know which.

564
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:49,267
- Woo!

565
00:34:50,305 --> 00:34:53,057
- Ow! Don't...
- Oh, sorry.

566
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:54,642
- On!
- You OK?

567
00:34:54,643 --> 00:34:56,190
- Uh-huh.

568
00:34:58,355 --> 00:35:01,524
What was that?
Did you... did you hear that?

569
00:35:01,525 --> 00:35:03,275
Did you lock the door?

570
00:35:03,276 --> 00:35:04,823
It's nothing.

571
00:35:06,113 --> 00:35:10,163
Trout, there's somebody here.
No, no, Trout! Get off! No...

572
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:15,496
- Argh!

573
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:21,386
- Are you OK?
- Uh-huh.

574
00:35:26,466 --> 00:35:30,594
Trout, I've temporarily paralysed ya.

575
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,597
You'll be right in 20 seconds.

576
00:35:32,598 --> 00:35:34,306
While I got ya here,

577
00:35:34,307 --> 00:35:38,310
Coral is an employee of
Trev Blundell Jaws O' Terror shark show.

578
00:35:38,311 --> 00:35:41,281
And being Trev Blundell,
I look out for her.

579
00:35:41,282 --> 00:35:43,524
'No'... means no.

580
00:35:43,525 --> 00:35:47,403
Don't mean 'maybe' or 'more please'.

581
00:35:47,404 --> 00:35:51,784
I've had a few conversations with Coral
and, physically, she's all woman.

582
00:35:51,785 --> 00:35:58,831
Mentally, she's, uh... ill-equipped
to part with her girlhood right now.

583
00:35:58,832 --> 00:36:00,791
I'm not sayin' never.

584
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:02,877
Maybe in a couple of years.

585
00:36:02,878 --> 00:36:05,212
You're OK now, Trout.

586
00:36:05,213 --> 00:36:06,886
Piss off.

587
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:24,190
Trout's not right for you.

588
00:36:24,191 --> 00:36:26,442
I been huntin' sharks 40 years.

589
00:36:26,443 --> 00:36:30,196
Seen his type before -
all instinct, no fear in him.

590
00:36:30,197 --> 00:36:33,032
He craves, devours, moves on.

591
00:36:33,033 --> 00:36:36,744
Trout isn't a shark. Boys aren't sharks.

592
00:36:36,745 --> 00:36:40,080
Everything is sharks. Life is sharks.

593
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:42,630
100 million years ago,
when the dinosaurs lay dyin',

594
00:36:42,631 --> 00:36:47,004
last thing they saw were sharks
laughin' at 'em.

595
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:50,716
That's the last thing we'll see too.

596
00:36:50,717 --> 00:36:54,428
I'm quitting my job
'cause I think you're mental.

597
00:36:54,429 --> 00:36:55,804
Mental is a shark.

598
00:36:55,805 --> 00:36:57,933
- It is not.
- It is.

599
00:36:59,434 --> 00:37:02,394
I expect to be schizophrenic
any day now,

600
00:37:02,395 --> 00:37:06,440
and none of my research
mentions sharks... ever.

601
00:37:06,441 --> 00:37:08,234
Is that right?

602
00:37:08,235 --> 00:37:10,909
I've been in a lunatic asylum.

603
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:16,700
Five years ago' After me daughter died
and me wife lost her mind.

604
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:20,538
I've battled insanity, and it's a shark.

605
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:24,375
Circles ya boat,
waitin' for you to fall.

606
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:27,255
You can't see it, but it's there.

607
00:37:28,421 --> 00:37:30,798
You know that feeling, Coral?

608
00:37:30,799 --> 00:37:33,803
'Cause if you don't,
I can show it to ya.

609
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:01,838
They have us surrounded, Coral.

610
00:38:03,957 --> 00:38:07,177
Madness is when you see 'em.

611
00:38:12,882 --> 00:38:14,930
Sanity.

612
00:38:18,013 --> 00:38:19,640
Insanity.

613
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:23,851
Don't dream of madness, Coral.

614
00:38:23,852 --> 00:38:28,105
When madness gets ya,
there's no 'you' left.

615
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:30,950
Just madness.

616
00:38:32,402 --> 00:38:34,655
What if it's too late?

617
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:40,995
I tried to kill myself when I was 13
by jumping off the verandah

618
00:38:40,996 --> 00:38:43,704
because I'm ugly and I'm abnormal.

619
00:38:43,705 --> 00:38:47,130
And my mum's in the loony bin,
my sister talks to aliens

620
00:38:47,131 --> 00:38:49,344
and my dad hates us.

621
00:38:52,088 --> 00:38:55,342
Even me being here
talking to you isn't normal.

622
00:38:57,135 --> 00:39:02,483
Look at you -
you're old, you have weird scars.

623
00:39:03,725 --> 00:39:06,569
And what do you want to be with me for,
anyway?

624
00:39:16,363 --> 00:39:18,331
You remind me of someone.

625
00:39:21,326 --> 00:39:23,328
Don't lose yourself, Coral.

626
00:39:24,496 --> 00:39:26,544
I know it don't seem like much...

627
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:30,835
...but it's all you got.

628
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:40,719
♪ Crazy... ♪

629
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,314
That's very inappropriate, Karen.
Very inappropriate.

630
00:39:43,315 --> 00:39:47,231
♪ Crazy for feelin' so lonely... ♪

631
00:39:48,353 --> 00:39:51,146
Well, it's not a really romantic story.

632
00:39:51,147 --> 00:39:53,857
Well, there's a romantic bit in it.

633
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:56,902
Uh, Barry was 25 and I was 24

634
00:39:56,903 --> 00:40:00,989
and, on our second date,
he sort of raped me.

635
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:04,535
Mm.
Date rape I suppose you'd call it now.

636
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:08,086
Yeah. On the terrace
of the Dolphin Heads Casino.

637
00:40:08,164 --> 00:40:12,340
Well, he'd had a bit to drink
and suddenly he was all over me.

638
00:40:12,341 --> 00:40:15,796
And I'm there going, 'No, no, '
like you do.

639
00:40:15,797 --> 00:40:18,926
But you know how men are -
they just go with the flow, don't they?

640
00:40:20,009 --> 00:40:21,725
Anyway, next day, I said to myself,

641
00:40:21,726 --> 00:40:24,894
'Shirley, if he doesn't call you
in three weeks, you're a slut.'

642
00:40:26,266 --> 00:40:30,737
It was before three weeks was up I found
out I was pregnant with Coral and...

643
00:40:30,738 --> 00:40:33,731
But he did call me. Yeah.

644
00:40:33,732 --> 00:40:36,030
That's the romantic bit.

645
00:40:37,444 --> 00:40:39,572
Boy, did he get a surprise.

646
00:40:42,449 --> 00:40:47,411
I suppose you think that's
a bad foundation for a marriage - rape.

647
00:40:47,412 --> 00:40:49,037
I've heard worse.

648
00:40:49,038 --> 00:40:50,581
Have you?

649
00:40:50,582 --> 00:40:52,875
- I've lived worse.
- Have you?

650
00:40:52,876 --> 00:40:54,460
You wouldn't know.

651
00:40:54,461 --> 00:40:58,714
See, you're not like my other doctors,
because you tell me stuff.

652
00:40:58,715 --> 00:41:01,683
Keep your voice down.
I don't want 'em stealing me techniques.

653
00:41:01,684 --> 00:41:03,802
Do you think I use food
as an emotional crutch?

654
00:41:03,803 --> 00:41:05,348
- Nup.
- What about waterfalls?

655
00:41:05,349 --> 00:41:06,812
What about waterfalls?

656
00:41:06,813 --> 00:41:09,808
Dr Kurland says, when I feel
overwhelmed, I should think of them.

657
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:13,359
Bullshit. What do these doctors do about
the daily misery that is your life?

658
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,148
Close your eyes and imagine this -

659
00:41:16,149 --> 00:41:19,119
a giant tumour eatin' your brain.

660
00:41:21,029 --> 00:41:23,029
You go into a hospital
filled with doctors,

661
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:26,533
experts on brain-eatin' tumours,
and what do they do?

662
00:41:26,534 --> 00:41:29,581
Brush ya hair over the bulge
so no-one can see it and send you home.

663
00:41:29,582 --> 00:41:32,549
But what you need
is someone to cut out the tumour

664
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:34,750
so you can live.

665
00:41:34,751 --> 00:41:36,335
Shaz.

666
00:41:36,336 --> 00:41:40,130
Oh, no! Sandra!

667
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:44,176
Gaw! Spun out! What are you doin'
in here, ya mad boong'?

668
00:41:44,177 --> 00:41:47,224
Oh, they reckon I've got
borderline personality disorder.

669
00:41:47,225 --> 00:41:48,813
Borderline fuckin' personality!

670
00:41:48,814 --> 00:41:51,686
What the fuck do they know
about my fuckin' personality?

671
00:41:51,687 --> 00:41:53,227
Fuckin' nothin'!

672
00:41:53,228 --> 00:41:58,106
I'm still vibrant.
Too vibrant for some, eh, Shaz?

673
00:41:58,107 --> 00:42:00,735
- Do you remember?

674
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:05,280
Shut up.

675
00:42:05,281 --> 00:42:07,907
I admit I had a bit too much to drink,
got a bit outta hand.

676
00:42:07,908 --> 00:42:10,788
Don't remember. Anyway, bit
of a punch-up, bit of a committal,

677
00:42:10,789 --> 00:42:12,329
and here I am.

678
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:14,549
- Yeah, they got Shirley in 'ere too.
- Fuck, no!

679
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,917
- Shirley, you in 'ere too?
- Mm.

680
00:42:16,918 --> 00:42:18,502
Who are ya?

681
00:42:18,503 --> 00:42:21,588
Shirley... Moochmore.

682
00:42:21,589 --> 00:42:25,264
What a stupid fuckin' name.
No wonder they put ya away.

683
00:42:28,096 --> 00:42:29,930
Aw, Sheree...

684
00:42:29,931 --> 00:42:32,775
Eh, she's great, this one.
Has she taken ya under her wing?

685
00:42:32,776 --> 00:42:35,519
Yep. Shirley's me project.

686
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,694
Are you one of Dr Thornbender's patients
as well?

687
00:42:44,112 --> 00:42:45,696
Yep'

688
00:42:45,697 --> 00:42:47,489
And I love her.

689
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:51,290
And I don't like whities, as a rule,
but Shaz... Shaz isn't white.

690
00:42:51,291 --> 00:42:53,871
She's a new colour.

691
00:42:53,872 --> 00:42:55,956
- She's mauve.
- Gaw.

692
00:42:55,957 --> 00:42:58,881
It's true, Shaz. Ya mauve.
Ya fuckin' mauve!

693
00:42:58,882 --> 00:43:00,629
Now, Shaz knows.

694
00:43:01,671 --> 00:43:03,422
She knows.

695
00:43:03,423 --> 00:43:06,466
She's gonna change your fuckin' life.

696
00:43:06,467 --> 00:43:08,561
That's the impression I get.

697
00:43:11,431 --> 00:43:14,308
The problem with you two
is you let people say you're crazy.

698
00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:16,605
You're only as crazy
as you let people say you are.

699
00:43:16,606 --> 00:43:18,820
I don't let anyone say I'm crazy,
so I'm normal.

700
00:43:18,821 --> 00:43:21,655
Youse, you let everyone
say you're crazy, so you're in here.

701
00:43:21,656 --> 00:43:24,778
- Dr Kurland...
- I don't care what them doctors say.

702
00:43:24,779 --> 00:43:26,695
What do you say?

703
00:43:26,696 --> 00:43:28,363
Are you crazy?

704
00:43:28,364 --> 00:43:30,332
I don't cope well.

705
00:43:31,784 --> 00:43:35,082
There's ways of copin'
that don't involve loony bins and drugs.

706
00:43:35,083 --> 00:43:37,500
There's offensive and defensive copin'.

707
00:43:37,501 --> 00:43:41,091
I've always favoured offensive meself.
Ya might say I invented it.

708
00:43:41,092 --> 00:43:43,133
But I'm gonna get you out of here,
Shirl.

709
00:43:43,134 --> 00:43:47,100
But first, we gotta deal
with them tumours of yours.

710
00:43:51,763 --> 00:43:55,393
Rise and shine! We got
mountains to climb, startin' now!

711
00:43:56,643 --> 00:43:58,852
Give us the mechanical man.

712
00:43:58,853 --> 00:44:00,899
I don't have
the mechanical man!

713
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,739
Forget about that. Ya never
gonna give 'em the mechanical man

714
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,950
'cause you're not a character
in Lost In Space.

715
00:44:05,951 --> 00:44:07,662
Now get up and get dressed.

716
00:44:09,781 --> 00:44:12,453
You think Noxious Nance
has climbed this mountain?

717
00:44:12,454 --> 00:44:15,579
'Course not!
She's too busy scrubbin' her driveway.

718
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:18,080
This takes guts and perseverance!

719
00:44:19,627 --> 00:44:22,000
Do ya reckon Auntie Doris
has climbed this mountain?

720
00:44:22,001 --> 00:44:23,751
She doesn't even know it's here.

721
00:44:23,752 --> 00:44:26,506
Ya gotta believe in yourselves, girls,
and each other.

722
00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:31,134
I can't go any further. I won't.

723
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:33,431
You don't get to the top
of this mountain, Coral,

724
00:44:33,432 --> 00:44:35,600
then ya nothin',
just like they say ya are.

725
00:44:35,601 --> 00:44:38,067
What's the point of getting to the top,
anyway?!

726
00:44:38,068 --> 00:44:39,982
Not bein' at the bottom.

727
00:44:44,107 --> 00:44:46,699
Come on, girls! That's it!
Almost there.

728
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,069
- I can't do it.
- Come on, Michelle.

729
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:52,163
- Come on, Michelle! Just move it!

730
00:44:52,164 --> 00:44:54,623
- I can't!
- We're all waiting here!

731
00:44:54,624 --> 00:44:56,665
Oi, get in behind her
and give her a push.

732
00:44:56,666 --> 00:45:00,789
- I can't!

733
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:04,126
- She's too heavy!

734
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:07,295
She's not heavy, she's ya sister!

735
00:45:17,348 --> 00:45:18,724
That's it, Michelle.

736
00:45:32,113 --> 00:45:35,834
I'm flying! Woo-hoo!

737
00:45:47,879 --> 00:45:51,383
Everybody, pick up a rock.

738
00:45:55,303 --> 00:45:58,056
One day this rock's
gonna mean somethin' to ya.

739
00:46:00,725 --> 00:46:03,649
Ya might lose the only thing
you ever loved,

740
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:06,188
or that ever loved you,

741
00:46:06,189 --> 00:46:08,440
but you're gonna look at this rock

742
00:46:08,441 --> 00:46:12,947
and you're gonna say, 'I can take it,
because I climbed the mountain.'

743
00:46:16,616 --> 00:46:19,201
This is where they live.

744
00:46:19,202 --> 00:46:21,000
It's where the voices live.

745
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:25,625
Can hear 'em clearer up here.

746
00:46:27,627 --> 00:46:29,470
They're singin'.

747
00:46:31,214 --> 00:46:32,761
They're 'appy.

748
00:46:34,634 --> 00:46:37,433
They was from Lost In Space,
wasn't they, Shaz'?

749
00:46:37,434 --> 00:46:40,472
Yeah. Knew as soon as I 'eard ya.

750
00:46:40,473 --> 00:46:44,434
'Give us the mechanical man.'
Great episode.

751
00:46:44,435 --> 00:46:47,689
Of course, not as great as the episode
where Dr Smith turns into a tree,

752
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:49,736
but you can't have everything.

753
00:46:51,067 --> 00:46:52,942
You're onto 'em now, Michelle.

754
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:55,288
They're gonna have to think
of somethin' else.

755
00:46:56,906 --> 00:46:59,032
None of youse are mental.

756
00:46:59,033 --> 00:47:02,077
Except you, Michelle. You're bonkers.

757
00:47:02,078 --> 00:47:03,796
But the rest of youse...

758
00:47:04,872 --> 00:47:06,123
Nah.

759
00:47:06,124 --> 00:47:08,166
But if we're not mental,

760
00:47:08,167 --> 00:47:09,919
we're just unpopular.

761
00:47:11,003 --> 00:47:13,426
I'll show you the meanin'
of the word 'mental'.

762
00:47:13,427 --> 00:47:16,258
Page 354.

763
00:47:16,259 --> 00:47:19,136
- 'Obsessive compulsive disorder.'
Yeah, that's her.

764
00:47:19,137 --> 00:47:22,230
'Stubborn, stingy, possessive,
uncreative and unimaginative,

765
00:47:22,231 --> 00:47:26,069
devoted to meaningless activities
that require being tidy and meticulous.'

766
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:27,602
It is her.

767
00:47:27,603 --> 00:47:30,150
Yeah, they're all in there -
the whole neighbourhood.

768
00:47:30,151 --> 00:47:33,994
See that delusional over there? He mowed
the same strip of grass yesterday.

769
00:47:33,995 --> 00:47:35,527
He can't help himself.

770
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:40,831
- Look. Look at him! Look!

771
00:47:40,832 --> 00:47:45,329
Ohh. Upset the delicate balance of
their fantasy world, and they go nuts.

772
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:48,003
- They can't all be mental.
- What are the odds of that?

773
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:52,345
Youse have stumbled on the meanin'
of life and ya don't even know it!

774
00:47:52,346 --> 00:47:55,797
America. Europe.

775
00:47:55,798 --> 00:47:59,676
Asia.
And all the way down here is Australia.

776
00:47:59,677 --> 00:48:02,429
Alone. Isolated.

777
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:05,400
Ever wonder why? Why we're down here?

778
00:48:06,976 --> 00:48:10,478
Well, we were a penal colony...

779
00:48:10,479 --> 00:48:12,320
Well, that's the cover story, yeah.

780
00:48:12,321 --> 00:48:15,535
But, historically, where have
they always sent the loonies?

781
00:48:15,536 --> 00:48:17,527
As far away as possible.

782
00:48:17,528 --> 00:48:19,904
And you can't get
any further away than Australia.

783
00:48:19,905 --> 00:48:22,282
We weren't a penal colony.
We was a lunatic asylum.

784
00:48:22,283 --> 00:48:25,000
Our ancestors were loonies,
and this is the result.

785
00:48:25,001 --> 00:48:27,791
Well, have a look around.
There's no such thing as normal.

786
00:48:27,792 --> 00:48:29,459
It's just different shades of mental.

787
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,960
Your totally mental
are in the lunatic asylums.

788
00:48:31,961 --> 00:48:36,296
The rest of 'em - the delusionals,
borderlines, compulsives,

789
00:48:36,297 --> 00:48:39,674
paranoids, schizoids -
make up Australia as we know it.

790
00:48:39,675 --> 00:48:42,051
We're nothin' but a livin' experiment
in madness

791
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:45,683
under constant observation by the
psychiatric community of the world.

792
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:52,896
But... if we're all under observation...
and mental,

793
00:48:52,897 --> 00:48:55,232
how come we're allowed to leave?

794
00:48:55,233 --> 00:48:59,444
Kylie Minogue.
She left. She's practically British.

795
00:48:59,445 --> 00:49:02,538
In any experiment,
there's test mice and control mice.

796
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:04,406
Control mice are marked in some way

797
00:49:04,407 --> 00:49:06,829
and sent off into the normal world
as comparisons.

798
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:10,079
Kylie Minogue's a control mouse.
Cate Blanchett - control mouse.

799
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,878
Russell Crowe -
a control mouse outta control.

800
00:49:12,879 --> 00:49:16,220
Rupert Murdoch, Nicole Kidman.
The list of control mice is endless.

801
00:49:16,221 --> 00:49:19,589
- What about you, Shaz?
- What about me?

802
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:22,059
Do you know the meaning
of the word 'conformity?

803
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:25,762
I don't. I instinctively do not know it.

804
00:49:25,763 --> 00:49:28,482
And that's how they knew about me.
Knew about me from birth'

805
00:49:28,483 --> 00:49:31,226
They been after me ever since.

806
00:49:31,227 --> 00:49:32,978
Who's after you?

807
00:49:32,979 --> 00:49:35,522
Scientists. After me brain.

808
00:49:35,523 --> 00:49:39,321
They want to study me, clone me,
or prevent me from happenin' again.

809
00:49:39,322 --> 00:49:40,943
I don't know which. I'm not psychic.

810
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:44,948
Luckily, Ripper is. He warns me
when they're gettin' too close.

811
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:47,702
And I understand
why they're scared of me.

812
00:49:47,703 --> 00:49:50,412
I'm the next step to human evolution.

813
00:49:50,413 --> 00:49:53,206
A next step to perfection.

814
00:49:53,207 --> 00:49:55,050
And they don't want me buildin' an army.

815
00:49:55,051 --> 00:49:57,460
- What army?
- An army of me.

816
00:49:57,461 --> 00:49:59,930
'Cause I can see the ones
who are like me -

817
00:49:59,931 --> 00:50:02,966
born without the instinct of conformity.

818
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:05,309
That's what led me to Dolphin Heads.

819
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:08,273
Ya think it was an accident
ya dad stopped for me?

820
00:50:08,274 --> 00:50:10,932
He had to. It was his destiny.

821
00:50:10,933 --> 00:50:12,559
Dad's like you.

822
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,144
Nup.

823
00:50:14,145 --> 00:50:16,521
Youse are.

824
00:50:16,522 --> 00:50:18,690
Youse are me army.

825
00:50:18,691 --> 00:50:20,900
Youse are next steps,

826
00:50:20,901 --> 00:50:25,780
but crushed into unrecognisability
by the forces of conformity.

827
00:50:25,781 --> 00:50:31,619
There ya go, Michelle.
A jam and cream doughnut on the house.

828
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:34,246
I didn't want a jam and cream doughnut.

829
00:50:34,247 --> 00:50:37,090
Oh, you sound just like your mum
when you say that.

830
00:50:37,091 --> 00:50:40,928
She's always telling us she doesn't
want the jam and cream doughnuts too,

831
00:50:40,929 --> 00:50:44,346
then she shovels 'em down
like there's no tomorrow.

832
00:50:44,347 --> 00:50:45,884
Doesn't she, Kay?

833
00:50:45,885 --> 00:50:51,723
We love your mum. We call her Mrs Moo.

834
00:50:51,724 --> 00:50:53,725
Where is she these days?

835
00:50:53,726 --> 00:50:56,394
She's in Wollongong, on 'oliday.

836
00:50:56,395 --> 00:50:59,814
Havin' a rest, is she? Nice long rest?

837
00:50:59,815 --> 00:51:03,109
Well, I believe ya. Thousands wouldn't.

838
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:07,781
Now, how about the rest of you Moos?
Are you ready for seconds?

839
00:51:07,782 --> 00:51:09,991
She's in a mental institution.

840
00:51:09,992 --> 00:51:12,077
She had a nervous breakdown.

841
00:51:12,078 --> 00:51:14,454
Get too much for her, did it?

842
00:51:14,455 --> 00:51:16,414
Mm, you might say that.

843
00:51:16,415 --> 00:51:18,588
You might say this place
broke her spirit.

844
00:51:18,589 --> 00:51:22,212
Dolphin Heads?
Nah. Best town in the world.

845
00:51:22,213 --> 00:51:24,255
- That right?
- Yeah.

846
00:51:24,256 --> 00:51:27,009
If she gone crazy,
it won't be Dolphin Heads.

847
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:30,138
Something... closer to home, I reckon.

848
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,766
What's your name, sweetheart?

849
00:51:34,767 --> 00:51:38,228
Manda. I'm the manageress.

850
00:51:38,229 --> 00:51:39,813
This is Kay.

851
00:51:39,814 --> 00:51:44,363
Manda... we just been readin'
about you, Manda. Haven't we, girls?

852
00:51:44,364 --> 00:51:47,237
- Right here, in me book.
- What book's that?

853
00:51:47,238 --> 00:51:50,740
Oh, it's kinda like the Bible,
except more about Australia than heaven.

854
00:51:50,741 --> 00:51:53,745
Here youse are.
Page 369. Can you read that?

855
00:51:53,746 --> 00:51:57,664
'Sadistic personality disorder...'

856
00:51:57,665 --> 00:52:00,544
No, not that bit' The underlined bit.

857
00:52:04,755 --> 00:52:08,007
You think these jam and cream doughnuts
are so fuckin' great, you eat 'em!

858
00:52:08,008 --> 00:52:12,227
I think young Kay wants a jam and cream
doughnut, girls. What do you think?

859
00:52:12,228 --> 00:52:15,974
Little career advice, psychos -
the customer is always right!

860
00:52:15,975 --> 00:52:18,192
If the Moos don't want
jam and cream doughnuts,

861
00:52:18,193 --> 00:52:20,608
they don't get jam and cream doughnuts!

862
00:52:25,526 --> 00:52:28,361
They are out to get you Moochmores.

863
00:52:28,362 --> 00:52:31,739
And these bitches are ruthless.
They declared war.

864
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:36,166
Well, we got one thing on our side -
they're crazy and we're not.

865
00:52:39,748 --> 00:52:41,666
That was fantastic!

866
00:52:48,549 --> 00:52:51,803
Manda and Kay lying on the ground...

867
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:57,149
Got ya doubts, haven't ya, Coral?

868
00:53:00,311 --> 00:53:05,607
I want to believe you, Shaz,
but... I'm not perfect.

869
00:53:05,608 --> 00:53:07,942
Look at me.

870
00:53:07,943 --> 00:53:11,488
I'm ugly, awkward.

871
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:13,698
I'm unpopular.

872
00:53:13,699 --> 00:53:16,451
That's proof of your perfection.

873
00:53:16,452 --> 00:53:18,919
They want you to hate yourself, Coral,

874
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,629
that way, they control ya.

875
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:24,503
And when they control ya,
they've robbed ya of your power.

876
00:53:24,504 --> 00:53:26,085
What power?

877
00:53:26,086 --> 00:53:28,339
A doctor once told me
I had six months to live.

878
00:53:29,423 --> 00:53:31,517
I took out me knife,
held it to his throat

879
00:53:31,518 --> 00:53:33,927
and I said, 'You take it back.'

880
00:53:33,928 --> 00:53:36,429
He took it back.

881
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:37,972
And I lived.

882
00:53:37,973 --> 00:53:40,190
- I couldn't do that.
- Nah, you could.

883
00:53:40,191 --> 00:53:44,232
- I couldn't pull a knife on anyone.
- Nah, you don't need the knife.

884
00:53:44,233 --> 00:53:45,777
You're stronger than I am.

885
00:53:46,815 --> 00:53:48,362
Shut up.

886
00:53:50,694 --> 00:53:54,574
Take enough pain and humiliation,
and a part of you dies.

887
00:53:56,242 --> 00:54:00,620
But the part that's left,
it can't be hurt no more.

888
00:54:00,621 --> 00:54:03,498
I call that a State O' Shaz.

889
00:54:03,499 --> 00:54:07,460
I am beyond pain and humiliation.

890
00:54:07,461 --> 00:54:11,714
I am the avenging angel
of the perpetually humiliated.

891
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:14,764
I'll save you, Coral.
I'll save ya whole family.

892
00:54:14,765 --> 00:54:16,636
I'll make you strong.

893
00:54:16,637 --> 00:54:20,765
And in return, you make me whole.

894
00:54:20,766 --> 00:54:22,475
- How?

895
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:27,364
Start by answerin' the door.
The coppers are here.

896
00:54:28,774 --> 00:54:30,608
See, you got a choice -

897
00:54:30,609 --> 00:54:34,534
things can either stay the way they are
or you can fight back.

898
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:41,327
So did this woman
say anything to you?

899
00:54:41,328 --> 00:54:43,371
- No.
- Yes.

900
00:54:43,372 --> 00:54:44,914
- No.
- Yes.

901
00:54:44,915 --> 00:54:47,043
- No. No.
- No.

902
00:54:47,044 --> 00:54:48,294
No.

903
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:51,343
Did she?

904
00:54:53,173 --> 00:54:54,846
Um...

905
00:54:56,552 --> 00:55:01,014
She said we were the next steps
in, um, human evolution.

906
00:55:01,015 --> 00:55:02,642
The next steps to perfection.

907
00:55:03,726 --> 00:55:05,478
- What, you lot?
- Yeah.

908
00:55:14,194 --> 00:55:17,113
Oh! Oh, your poor dad.

909
00:55:17,114 --> 00:55:19,583
Show 'em this, so we can get outta here.

910
00:55:23,329 --> 00:55:25,371
Is this supposed to be her?

911
00:55:25,372 --> 00:55:28,666
Yes. According to six eyewitnesses.

912
00:55:28,667 --> 00:55:30,209
Well, they're wrong.

913
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:33,296
Her hair wasn't brown, It was blonde.

914
00:55:33,297 --> 00:55:35,006
Blonde?

915
00:55:35,007 --> 00:55:38,718
And she wasn't 5ft. She was 6ft.

916
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:41,061
- Yeah, she was tall.
- Yep, she was really tall.

917
00:55:41,062 --> 00:55:43,228
And her eyes weren't blue.
They were brown.

918
00:55:43,229 --> 00:55:46,648
- Brown eyes...
- Um“. and she was Chinese.

919
00:55:49,772 --> 00:55:54,317
Yep. That's right. She was Chinese.

920
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:57,913
- Was she all Chinese?
- Except for the French bits.

921
00:56:13,545 --> 00:56:15,921
Remember that fuckin' awful
white racist shit song

922
00:56:15,922 --> 00:56:18,299

00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:42,990
I told Sandra all about you.
Told her you was warts-n-all honest.

935
00:56:42,991 --> 00:56:45,788
- Especially the warts.
- Jesus! Look at the size of this one!

936
00:56:45,789 --> 00:56:47,627
- Who are you, love?
- It's Donna.

- You gonna invite us in, Donna?
- No! No, I can't!

How do you like it?

942
00:57:16,191 --> 00:57:18,025

Excuse me.
Did I invite you inside?

946
00:57:32,249 --> 00:57:34,875
Donna's making us tea.
She's a credit to you, Nance.

947
00:57:34,876 --> 00:57:38,131
She's got great legs too.
Hey, Donna, stretch them hamstrings.

948
00:57:39,423 --> 00:57:41,642
- See that, Shaz? It's amazing.

949

Here. Here's what you came for.
Go on. Off you go. Shoo!

954
00:57:56,023 --> 00:57:57,568
You're being rude, Mum.

955
00:57:57,569 --> 00:58:00,786
No, no, don't worry, Donna.
This is more than a social visit.

956
00:58:00,787 --> 00:58:03,112
It's an intervention.

957
00:58:03,113 --> 00:58:05,455
Nance,
you're obsessive compulsive disorder,

958
00:58:05,456 --> 00:58:07,370
and a nasty, gossiping bitch to boot.

959
00:58:07,371 --> 00:58:09,117
You need help and we're here to help ya.

960
00:58:09,118 --> 00:58:11,745
You can't control the world
with cleanliness and order.

961
00:58:11,746 --> 00:58:16,000
Life's not like that. Life's mess.
Oozin', ﬂowin', drippin' mess.

962
00:58:16,001 --> 00:58:18,548
Sure, you can keep your house
lookin' like a science lab

963
00:58:18,549 --> 00:58:21,092
and you can have Donna
actin' like a nun with a netball,

964
00:58:21,093 --> 00:58:23,137
but what are you gonna do
when life busts in?

965
00:58:23,138 --> 00:58:27,428
And you, Nance, you're flesh and blood,
sweat and piss.

966
00:58:27,429 --> 00:58:30,348
You're a woman, Nance, not Tupperware.

967
00:58:30,349 --> 00:58:33,601
Nah, we can't leave ya.
This is an emergency.

968
00:58:33,602 --> 00:58:37,688
- I'm calling the police.
- Nah, not a police emergency.

969
00:58:37,689 --> 00:58:39,236
A feminine emergency.

970
00:58:40,275 --> 00:58:41,822
Ya got any pads?

971
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:45,785
- What?
- You known. Pads.

972
00:58:47,741 --> 00:58:49,951
Writing pads?

973
00:58:49,952 --> 00:58:52,831
Sanitary pads. Preferably maxi.

974
00:58:54,456 --> 00:58:57,207
- For who?
-  All of us, actually, yeah.

975
00:58:57,208 --> 00:59:00,256
You know how women living
in close proximity line up menstrually?

976
00:59:00,257 --> 00:59:03,973
Something to do with the moon. Well,
we've all lined up, haven't we, girls?

977
00:59:03,974 --> 00:59:06,469
Right here, in your lounge room.

978
00:59:08,262 --> 00:59:11,266
I'm havin' an emergency
on your white couch.

979
00:59:11,267 --> 00:59:15,643
- Me too.
- Oh, you're a woman now, Jane.

980
00:59:15,644 --> 00:59:18,604

Oh, I'm bleedin' like a stuck one,

986
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:31,873
- Aargghhhh!
- I'll get the toilet paper.

987
00:59:31,874 --> 00:59:34,912
Where's the bathroom?
Excuse me.

988
00:59:34,913 --> 00:59:36,455
Get out!

989
00:59:36,456 --> 00:59:39,583
Jane, let Nance hit ya with that
boomerang. It's good therapy for her.

990
00:59:39,584 --> 00:59:43,215
Don't be afraid of mess, Nance.
Mess is good. Mess is life.

991
00:59:43,216 --> 00:59:46,007
- Call the police!
- I invited them in!

992
00:59:46,008 --> 00:59:48,850
What are the cops gonna do, Nance?
Arrest us for bleedin'?

993

That's it, Nance. Lose control.
Fight ya pathology!

I warned ya.

1039
01:04:43,597 --> 01:04:45,599
This time I kill ya.

1040
01:05:05,869 --> 01:05:09,919
Nah, I said to him, 'I'm not going to
have sex with you on the first date.

1041
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,665
I have self-respect.'

1042
01:05:11,666 --> 01:05:13,213
- Yeah. I know...

1043
01:05:13,214 --> 01:05:15,461
Hang on a tick.

1044
01:05:15,462 --> 01:05:18,557
Dolphin Heads Council, Mayor
Moochmore's office, Tisha speakin'.

1045
01:05:22,677 --> 01:05:27,223
Barry! Mayor Moochmore!

1046
01:05:27,224 --> 01:05:30,444
- I'm in conference!
- There's an emergency at home.

1047
01:05:34,105 --> 01:05:36,273
I painted that.

1048
01:05:36,274 --> 01:05:38,823
I'm helping Jean widen her access road.

1049
01:05:40,987 --> 01:05:43,739
They reckon somebody's died!

1050
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:46,994
Where are youse? Argh, me back!
I'm here! I'm here!

1051
01:05:49,204 --> 01:05:52,797
See? I told you he wasn't dead.
Just seemed like it.

1052
01:05:52,798 --> 01:05:55,633
Sit down, Barry.
You're just in time to carve the bird.

1053
01:05:55,634 --> 01:05:58,549
The girls cooked everything you see,
includin' the stuffin'.

1054
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:01,093
You seem a bit stuffed yourself.
What have you been up to?

1055
01:06:01,094 --> 01:06:05,437
Here's your beer. Here's your name tag
so nobody forgets who anybody is.

1056
01:06:05,438 --> 01:06:06,975
Michelle.

1057
01:06:08,556 --> 01:06:11,517
- Peas, Dad?
- Bread and butter, Dad?

1058
01:06:11,518 --> 01:06:14,270
- Delicious corn.
- This is gravy.

1059
01:06:14,271 --> 01:06:16,740
Uh... yeah.

1060
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:20,695
You girls cooked this yourselves?

1061
01:06:20,696 --> 01:06:22,822
Certainly did.

1062
01:06:22,823 --> 01:06:24,573
It's, um...

1063
01:06:26,366 --> 01:06:28,118
...it's great.

1064
01:06:29,286 --> 01:06:30,913
Um...

1065
01:06:32,289 --> 01:06:35,040
..I gotta go.

1066
01:06:35,041 --> 01:06:37,751
You're not goin' anywhere.

1067
01:06:37,752 --> 01:06:40,587
- What?
- You 'eard me.

1068
01:06:40,588 --> 01:06:41,803
- What?
- You 'eard me.

1069
01:06:41,804 --> 01:06:42,968
- What?
- You heard me.

1070
01:06:42,969 --> 01:06:44,511
- What?
- You. Heard me.

1071
01:06:44,512 --> 01:06:46,056
- What?
- What' means 'no'.

1072
01:06:46,057 --> 01:06:47,219
What?

1073
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:50,347
When Dad says 'what' like that,
he means no.

1074
01:06:50,348 --> 01:06:53,270
That right, Barry? When you
say 'what' like that, you mean 'no'?

1075
01:06:53,271 --> 01:06:54,939
- Or do you just mean 'what'?
- What?

1076
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:57,483
Or does it mean 'l don't feel
comfortable with you girls

1077
01:06:57,484 --> 01:07:00,322
'cause I don't know any of ya,
and I don't know what to say to ya.

1078
01:07:00,323 --> 01:07:02,158
Easiest thing to do is run off
to the pub,

1079
01:07:02,159 --> 01:07:04,198
talk about nothing
instead of everything.'

1080
01:07:04,199 --> 01:07:06,448
And that's what 'what' means.
Innit, Barry?

1081
01:07:38,021 --> 01:07:40,481
Wakey-wakey!

1082
01:07:40,482 --> 01:07:43,825
I admired you, Barry.
I thought you was a big man.

1083
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:47,789
But you're nothin' but
a self-centred, whinin' piece of shit.

1084
01:07:47,790 --> 01:07:48,822
Jesus.

1085
01:07:48,823 --> 01:07:51,370
You think I'm gonna stand by
while you abuse your family?

1086
01:07:51,371 --> 01:07:52,913
I'd never hit any of 'em.

1087
01:07:52,914 --> 01:07:55,503
I know. You don't have the guts
to use your fists.

1088
01:07:55,504 --> 01:07:57,793
You slap them girls around with silence,
don't ya?

1089
01:07:57,794 --> 01:07:59,382
Ya kick 'em by not lookin' at 'em.

1090
01:07:59,383 --> 01:08:02,548
Ya beat your wife by not comin' home
and fucking anything that moves.

1091
01:08:02,549 --> 01:08:04,637
- That's...
- Shut up! I heard the stories.

1092
01:08:04,638 --> 01:08:07,225
You know what I did
when my husband hit me?

1093
01:08:07,226 --> 01:08:12,763
I slit his face open
from his eyebrows to his chin.

1094
01:08:12,764 --> 01:08:14,856
You think he ever hit me again?

1095
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:19,023
Hit me? He couldn't even look
in the mirror without cryin' about it.

1096
01:08:19,024 --> 01:08:21,567
Shut up and keep movin'!

1097
01:08:21,568 --> 01:08:23,441
- Shaz! Don't hurt him!
- Call the police!

1098
01:08:24,984 --> 01:08:26,736
- Get off...
- Get in there!

1099
01:08:26,737 --> 01:08:30,072
Oh! You can't kill me!
I'm an elected official!

1100
01:08:30,073 --> 01:08:32,701
Oh, it's easy to impress people
who don't know ya, innit?

1101
01:08:32,702 --> 01:08:33,992
I'll be missed!

1102
01:08:33,993 --> 01:08:36,212
Yeah, only by your family.
Suck on that irony.

1103
01:08:38,998 --> 01:08:41,291
- Michelle...
- I don't have it!

1104
01:08:41,292 --> 01:08:43,044
- Michelle, it's me, love.
- I'm sorry!

1105
01:08:43,045 --> 01:08:45,718
I'm so sorry. I don't have it.

1106
01:08:48,633 --> 01:08:50,259
Shaz?

1107
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:52,845
Yeah. I got ya dad down here.

1108
01:08:52,846 --> 01:08:54,846
This is where she sleeps now, Barry.

1109
01:08:54,847 --> 01:08:58,944
She waits till everyone goes to bed
and then she moves her stuff down here.

1110
01:08:58,945 --> 01:09:02,563
Tell your dad
what you're doin' down here, Michelle.

1111
01:09:02,564 --> 01:09:04,405
They know where to find me up there.

1112
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:06,320
- Who does?
- The ones from Lost In Space.

1113
01:09:06,321 --> 01:09:09,446
They want the mechanical man.
I don't have him!

1114
01:09:09,447 --> 01:09:11,363
They know where I sleep.

1115
01:09:11,364 --> 01:09:14,116
They want to hurt me 'cause I'm bad.

1116
01:09:14,117 --> 01:09:16,493
They took Mum 'cause I let 'em down.

1117
01:09:16,494 --> 01:09:18,667
I can't be up there no more.

1118
01:09:20,290 --> 01:09:23,009
She needs 'elp, Barry.
What are ya gonna do about it?

1119
01:09:24,919 --> 01:09:26,885
- I'm onto it, sweetheart.
- No!

1120
01:09:26,886 --> 01:09:28,598
- You can come out now.
- No!

1121
01:09:28,599 --> 01:09:31,592
I've gotta stay here!

1122
01:09:31,593 --> 01:09:34,016
I gotta stay... here.

1123
01:09:35,305 --> 01:09:38,015
I wanna talk to her - alone.

1124
01:09:38,016 --> 01:09:40,895
<i>- Nup.
- She's my daughter, not yours!</i>

1125
01:10:02,999 --> 01:10:05,001
Why don't you tell me about it, OK?

1126
01:10:05,002 --> 01:10:07,294
You won't get mad?

1127
01:10:07,295 --> 01:10:10,214
No.

1128
01:10:10,215 --> 01:10:11,882
I won't get mad.

1129
01:10:11,883 --> 01:10:14,807
You won't hate me no more?

1130
01:10:27,565 --> 01:10:29,533
You were married, Shaz.

1131
01:10:30,610 --> 01:10:33,529
You were married to Trevor Blundell.

1132
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:36,031
Married?

1133
01:10:36,032 --> 01:10:38,116
Till death do us part.

1134
01:10:38,117 --> 01:10:41,246
I meant that, even if he didn't.

1135
01:10:42,330 --> 01:10:45,550
- He told me you were dead.
- And what about Grace?

1136
01:10:46,584 --> 01:10:49,503
He tell you about our daughter?

1137
01:10:49,504 --> 01:10:51,677
He told you she was dead too, didn't he?

1138
01:10:53,341 --> 01:10:55,509
Yeah, well, she ain't dead.

1139
01:10:55,510 --> 01:10:58,434
He's got her.
And he keeps her against her will.

1140
01:11:00,139 --> 01:11:02,558
That's why I come to Dolphin Heads.

1141
01:11:02,559 --> 01:11:05,602
That's why your dad stopped for me.

1142
01:11:05,603 --> 01:11:08,823
That's why you work for him.

1143
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:11,776
It's your destiny.

1144
01:11:15,446 --> 01:11:17,073
Trust me?

1145
01:11:22,287 --> 01:11:24,961
I done for you, didn't I?

1146
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:29,918
Then you do for me.

1147
01:11:43,266 --> 01:11:45,475
Go on.

1148
01:11:45,476 --> 01:11:47,399
He needs ya.

1149
01:11:51,608 --> 01:11:53,692
Ian Davies, please.

1150
01:11:53,693 --> 01:11:55,411
Yeah, Barry Moochmore.

1151
01:11:57,030 --> 01:12:02,242
Yeah, Ian?
Oh, no... not good actually.

1152
01:12:02,243 --> 01:12:04,712
It's my daughter Michelle,
she's feeling crook.

1153
01:12:07,248 --> 01:12:09,296
She's hearing voices, Ian.

1154
01:12:10,376 --> 01:12:13,295
Telling her to kill herself and that.

1155
01:12:13,296 --> 01:12:17,096
Yeah, I think you better.
See you soon.

1156
01:12:25,183 --> 01:12:26,776
I don't hate youse.

1157
01:12:28,645 --> 01:12:30,647
Who said I hated youse?

1158
01:12:34,317 --> 01:12:36,695
I grew up with boys, that's all.

1159
01:12:41,658 --> 01:12:44,076
They used to compare...

1160
01:12:44,077 --> 01:12:46,296
...me and me brothers
to the Kennedys.

1161
01:12:48,539 --> 01:12:52,709
We was like Jack, Bobby
and Teddy in Hyannis Port.

1162
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:55,839
'Cept we were Barry, Vince
and Ken in Dolphin Heads.

1163
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,431
And me dad...

1164
01:12:59,175 --> 01:13:05,722
...he was a big man, a rogue,
like old Joe Kennedy was.

1165
01:13:05,723 --> 01:13:09,768
And he told us
that we was destined for greatness

1166
01:13:09,769 --> 01:13:11,487
like them Kennedy boys.

1167
01:13:22,281 --> 01:13:24,659
But this is my greatness, isn't it?

1168
01:13:27,787 --> 01:13:30,165
Mayor of nothing
but a shithole town...

1169
01:13:31,874 --> 01:13:35,919
...with an insane wife
and five mental daughters.

1170
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:38,964
So you didn't get what you want?
Big deal!

1171
01:13:38,965 --> 01:13:42,060
We're girls, Dad - we're gonna
be girls for the rest of our lives,

1172
01:13:42,061 --> 01:13:45,220
so why don't you just shut up about it?!

1173
01:13:45,221 --> 01:13:46,814
And we want you
to start coming home

1174
01:13:46,815 --> 01:13:49,015
and talking to us about things.

1175
01:13:49,016 --> 01:13:53,270
And taking us places,
like the beach and that.

1176
01:13:53,271 --> 01:13:54,862
Like we were a real family.

1177
01:13:54,863 --> 01:13:58,233
- 'Cause we are one.
- If you think about it.

1178
01:13:58,234 --> 01:14:01,158
And we want you to stop
seeing other women,

1179
01:14:01,159 --> 01:14:03,697
because everybody knows about it.

1180
01:14:03,698 --> 01:14:06,658
Mum did too.

1181
01:14:06,659 --> 01:14:08,878
It's just embarrassing.

1182
01:14:12,290 --> 01:14:16,918
I would never have dared -
not in a million years -

1183
01:14:16,919 --> 01:14:20,213
<i>dared to talk to my father like this!</i>

1184
01:14:20,214 --> 01:14:23,593
One wrong look and he thrashed
the living daylights outta me!

1185
01:14:53,414 --> 01:14:58,090
Yea... he was a bad father too.

1186
01:15:22,568 --> 01:15:27,906
Dad... there weren't only
Kennedy boys.

1187
01:15:27,907 --> 01:15:30,992
There were girls too.

1188
01:15:30,993 --> 01:15:34,543
And one of them was mental
and they put her away.

1189
01:15:37,208 --> 01:15:38,255
So...

1190
01:15:39,877 --> 01:15:43,677
...you're sort of like a Kennedy,
if you think about it.

1191
01:15:53,558 --> 01:15:57,654
Yeah... I reckon I am.

1192
01:16:04,777 --> 01:16:06,611
Doris Charles speaking.

1193
01:16:06,612 --> 01:16:08,533
<i>We have Elizabeth the 1st</i>

1194
01:16:08,534 --> 01:16:10,033
<i>and all her weird friends.</i>

1195
01:16:15,329 --> 01:16:17,252
No!

1196
01:16:28,509 --> 01:16:29,556
Smile.

1197
01:16:35,641 --> 01:16:37,939
Doris has got something
to say to you, Shirley.

1198
01:16:42,273 --> 01:16:43,320
I've...

1199
01:16:45,651 --> 01:16:46,698
I've...

1200
01:16:49,739 --> 01:16:52,492
- I've...
- What's that? Speak up, Doris.

1201
01:16:53,618 --> 01:16:56,417
I've always...

1202
01:16:58,748 --> 01:17:01,333
...been jealous of you...

1203
01:17:01,334 --> 01:17:06,254
...of your sweet, caring nature...

1204
01:17:06,255 --> 01:17:08,722
...and the fact that Mum loved you
more than she loved me.

1205
01:17:08,723 --> 01:17:10,887
- Oh! No, she didn't.
- She did.

1206
01:17:10,888 --> 01:17:12,260
- She didn't.
- She did.

1207
01:17:12,261 --> 01:17:13,806
- She did'
- She really didn't.

1208
01:17:13,807 --> 01:17:16,726
She did. And old Doris here's
been pissed off about it for years.

1209
01:17:16,727 --> 01:17:18,726
But you're over that now,
ain't you, Doris?

1210
01:17:18,727 --> 01:17:19,768
Yes.

1211
01:17:19,769 --> 01:17:22,020
Twice a week, she's gonna come over
to your house

1212
01:17:22,021 --> 01:17:23,487
for tea with you and the girls.

1213
01:17:23,488 --> 01:17:26,107
Afterwards, she's gonna help
with the dishes, aren't you?

1214
01:17:26,108 --> 01:17:29,533
Maybe some vacuuming and a little
bit laundry too, aren't you, Doris?

1215
01:17:29,534 --> 01:17:31,075
Aren't ya?

1216
01:17:32,114 --> 01:17:33,865
Elizabeth the 1st.

1217
01:17:33,866 --> 01:17:35,700
Yes, I am. I will, yes.

1218
01:17:35,701 --> 01:17:38,286
And she's very, very sorry.

1219
01:17:38,287 --> 01:17:40,956
I'm very, very sorry.

1220
01:17:40,957 --> 01:17:42,709
- For what?
- For being a cunt.

1221
01:17:42,710 --> 01:17:44,376
Oh, no. Oh...

1222
01:17:44,377 --> 01:17:47,345
But you are a cunt. You are
the cuntiest cunt of all time.

1223
01:17:47,346 --> 01:17:49,805
- Admit your cunthood.
- Don't make her say that.

1224
01:17:49,806 --> 01:17:53,178
- An irrefutable fact, like gravity.
- Oh, please don't make her say that.

1225
01:17:53,179 --> 01:17:57,430
Alright. She's sorry for not
being a very good sister. Hm?

1226
01:17:57,431 --> 01:17:59,849
Oh, I'm sorry too.

1227
01:17:59,850 --> 01:18:01,727
- You don't have to be sorry.
- Yes, I do.

1228
01:18:01,728 --> 01:18:03,728
- No. Shirley?
- I do. I do.

1229
01:18:03,729 --> 01:18:05,104
- Shirley? Shirley?
- I do.

1230
01:18:05,105 --> 01:18:07,279
- But I do. I really am sorry.
- Shirley?

1231
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:11,154
She's right. You don't.

1232
01:18:13,072 --> 01:18:15,416
I haven't been a very good sister.

1233
01:18:17,827 --> 01:18:20,412
Oh, come on out, Shirley.

1234
01:18:20,413 --> 01:18:22,381
Everything's gonna be alright.

1235
01:18:26,585 --> 01:18:30,588
But what about Barry?
Is he still angry with me?

1236
01:18:30,589 --> 01:18:33,056
Shirley, as you know,
I think Doris here's a cunt,

1237
01:18:33,057 --> 01:18:36,302
but she is right about one thing -
Barry's a bit of a dickhead.

1238
01:18:36,303 --> 01:18:39,682
Don't worry about what he thinks
'cause he only ever thinks of himself.

1239
01:18:39,683 --> 01:18:40,729
Mum!

1240
01:18:42,893 --> 01:18:45,103
Hello!

1241
01:18:45,104 --> 01:18:47,772
Mum? Mum?
Mum, it's me. Mum, it's me.

1242
01:18:49,692 --> 01:18:50,739
G'day, love.

1243
01:18:53,112 --> 01:18:55,865
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, I'm fine... fine.

1244
01:18:55,866 --> 01:18:57,699
Oh, sweetheart, stop...

1245
01:18:57,700 --> 01:19:00,118
I voted for you... so did Beverly.

1246
01:19:00,119 --> 01:19:02,211
Oh, thank you, love. Both of youse.

1247
01:19:02,212 --> 01:19:05,001
You can come out now, Mum.
The house is all clean.

1248
01:19:05,002 --> 01:19:07,466
And Noxious Nance went mental,
didn't she, Shaz?

1249
01:19:07,467 --> 01:19:09,836
High-dependency ward, Shirley.
The Quiet Room.

1250
01:19:09,837 --> 01:19:13,260
Donna ran off with a borderline
personality lesbian Aboriginal.

1251
01:19:13,261 --> 01:19:15,223
- You remember? Sandra.

1252
01:19:15,224 --> 01:19:17,559
- Oh, Sandra. How is Sandra?
- Married.

1253
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,929
- To Donna.
- Here. They sent me a picture.

1254
01:19:19,930 --> 01:19:22,727
They eloped to Adelaide
and Nance just went ballistic

1255
01:19:22,728 --> 01:19:24,646
and kidnapped Donna
out of a supermarket.

1256
01:19:24,647 --> 01:19:26,896
So Sandra's doctors had Nance certified.

1257
01:19:28,147 --> 01:19:31,151
See Shirley, all this time
you was the normal one.

1258
01:19:31,152 --> 01:19:32,609
And guess what?

1259
01:19:32,610 --> 01:19:35,862
Oh. Oh, I'm schizophrenic.

1260
01:19:35,863 --> 01:19:38,239
Michelle's schizophrenic
and Coral's not.

1261
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:40,240
Dad got a psychiatrist.
Didn't you?

1262
01:19:40,241 --> 01:19:41,492
Yeah, yeah. Ian Davies.

1263
01:19:41,493 --> 01:19:43,462
You remember Ian - he's the one that...

1264
01:19:43,463 --> 01:19:46,498
...helped put you...

1265
01:19:46,499 --> 01:19:49,876
But he gave me, um... uh, 'clozapine'.

1266
01:19:49,877 --> 01:19:53,220
Long as Michelle keeps taking that,
she's gonna be fine.

1267
01:19:53,221 --> 01:19:57,390
Oh. I don't know if things are
coming together or falling apart.

1268
01:19:58,844 --> 01:20:03,264
Don't cry, Mum. I'm happy.

1269
01:20:03,265 --> 01:20:05,982
All the girls are jealous of me,
aren't ya?

1270
01:20:05,983 --> 01:20:07,978
- Come out, Shirl.

1271
01:20:10,314 --> 01:20:12,899
You can't be in here no more.

1272
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:15,151
Please come home.
We miss you so much, Mum.

1273
01:20:15,152 --> 01:20:16,993
We made our beds
and I washed the dishes

1274
01:20:16,994 --> 01:20:18,489
and Kayleen dried them.

1275
01:20:21,867 --> 01:20:25,995
- Come home, love.
- It's really clean.

1276
01:20:25,996 --> 01:20:27,872
- Please, Mum?
- OK.

1277
01:20:27,873 --> 01:20:29,420
Yes!

1278
01:20:39,802 --> 01:20:41,761
Saturday, 7pm.

1279
01:20:41,762 --> 01:20:45,767
He'll be at the aquarium,
spouting his shark-hunter bullshit.

1280
01:20:45,768 --> 01:20:47,851
And that's when we do it.

1281
01:20:47,852 --> 01:20:50,571
Now the boat's booby-trapped,
so we gotta be smart.

1282
01:20:52,022 --> 01:20:55,322
If we want Grace, we have to have
something we can negotiate with,

1283
01:20:55,323 --> 01:20:58,069
something he cares about.

1284
01:20:58,070 --> 01:21:00,448
You know what I'm talking about,
don't you, Coral?

1285
01:21:02,783 --> 01:21:06,003
Find the keys,
unlock them chains on the wheels.

1286
01:21:07,037 --> 01:21:09,005
We tow it right outta there.

1287
01:21:24,263 --> 01:21:28,558
♪ She doesn't know
what she does to me

1288
01:21:28,559 --> 01:21:32,103
♪ Born without
the instinct of conformity

1289
01:21:32,104 --> 01:21:35,940

1291

♪ Maybe she's not the solution

1293
01:21:43,365 --> 01:21:47,827

01:21:47,828 --> 01:21:49,796

1295
01:21:53,792 --> 01:21:55,508
- What are you singing, mate?
- What?

1296
01:21:55,509 --> 01:21:57,173
Where'd you get them words?

1297
01:21:57,174 --> 01:21:59,594
- I made 'em up.
- 'Instinct of conformity'?

1298
01:21:59,595 --> 01:22:01,132
'Next step'?

1299
01:22:01,133 --> 01:22:05,138
Where is she?
Where is the mad bitch?!

1300
01:22:08,974 --> 01:22:10,021
Grace?

1301
01:22:26,533 --> 01:22:29,252
Where is she? Where's your daughter?!

1302
01:22:35,209 --> 01:22:38,169
Shhh! There's someone coming.

1303
01:22:38,170 --> 01:22:41,219
Nothing to worry about, Shirl.
We're just stealing my ex's shark.

1304
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:43,174
- Go back to bed.

1305
01:22:43,175 --> 01:22:45,553
- Shaz!

1306
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:50,681
- That old bitch.
- This is a kidnapping.

1307
01:22:50,682 --> 01:22:53,402
Don't worry, I've been in tighter
spots than this. Come on!

1308
01:22:53,403 --> 01:22:55,186
No, Shaz, no...

1309
01:22:55,187 --> 01:22:58,485
When you wake up, Shirley, I'll be
gone and you'll have your family back.

1310
01:22:58,486 --> 01:23:00,029
- No...
- Mum, I've got this.

1311
01:23:01,777 --> 01:23:04,153
Youse check the hallway,
youse check the verandah.

1312
01:23:04,154 --> 01:23:06,701
Don't worry, we're not here for you -
we're here for Shaz.

1313
01:23:06,702 --> 01:23:09,166
She's nuts.
She attacked me with a knife.

1314
01:23:09,167 --> 01:23:13,039
Oh, shut up about that.
More importantly, where are my dolls?

1315
01:23:22,548 --> 01:23:24,221
He told me about you, Shaz.

1316
01:23:26,051 --> 01:23:27,642
Black out your face, Coral.

1317
01:23:27,643 --> 01:23:29,602
- Grace drowned.
- What?

1318
01:23:29,603 --> 01:23:32,395
She was a drug addict.
She went swimming in the sea...

1319
01:23:34,727 --> 01:23:37,604
You don't know the first thing
about me daughter, you hear me?!

1320
01:23:37,605 --> 01:23:39,650
Grace weren't on drugs
and she didn't drown.

1321
01:23:39,651 --> 01:23:42,570
She got took by a shark-
his shark, the one in his show.

1322
01:23:42,571 --> 01:23:44,115
The shark that ate Harold Holt?

1323
01:23:44,116 --> 01:23:45,820
It never ate Harold Holt-

1324
01:23:45,821 --> 01:23:47,787
that's bullshit he made up
for the punters.

1325
01:23:47,788 --> 01:23:50,532
He caught it five years ago,
the day after Grace went missing

1326
01:23:50,533 --> 01:23:52,705
'cause he knew it was
the shark that took her.

1327
01:23:52,706 --> 01:23:55,545
He's got a restraining order
on you, Shaz.

1328
01:23:55,546 --> 01:23:57,883
He says if you go near him,
he'll put you away again.

1329
01:23:57,884 --> 01:23:59,125
Again?

1330
01:23:59,126 --> 01:24:01,968
You told him, didn't you?
Oh, you told him.

1331
01:24:01,969 --> 01:24:04,759
- He already knew!
- Don't you lie to me!

1332
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:08,510
You're the liar! We're not special,
we're not the next steps either!

1333
01:24:08,511 --> 01:24:11,229
- No, Coral!
- Three times it's happened.

1334
01:24:11,230 --> 01:24:16,225
He moves to a place
and she finds losers, losers like us.

1335
01:24:16,226 --> 01:24:18,227
No, I'm not a loser!

1336
01:24:18,228 --> 01:24:22,231
She picks the stupid and the lonely,
and she flatters ya,

1337
01:24:22,232 --> 01:24:24,403
avenges ya, and before you know it,

1338
01:24:24,404 --> 01:24:27,996
you have boot-polish on your face,
helping her steal a dead shark!

1339
01:24:27,997 --> 01:24:30,573
No! Coral, she believes in us!

1340
01:24:30,574 --> 01:24:34,160
Tell 'em.
Tell them what you really think.

1341
01:24:34,161 --> 01:24:35,411
Oh, shut up!

1342
01:24:35,412 --> 01:24:36,957
Tell 'em, you lying bitch!

1343
01:24:36,958 --> 01:24:40,674
You're nothin'! You're too stupid
to stand up for yourselves,

1344
01:24:40,675 --> 01:24:42,715
too lazy to care about anyone but you!

1345
01:24:42,716 --> 01:24:45,260
What else are you good for but lies?!

1346
01:24:59,895 --> 01:25:01,437
Get it?

1347
01:25:01,438 --> 01:25:06,410
We're stupid, lazy and unpopular.

1348
01:25:07,736 --> 01:25:09,864
But at least we're not crazy.

1349
01:25:12,616 --> 01:25:13,993
You take it back.

1350
01:25:20,124 --> 01:25:22,001
Take it back.

1351
01:25:25,170 --> 01:25:27,298
You hear voices.

1352
01:25:30,050 --> 01:25:33,052
You hear your daughter's voice
calling you

1353
01:25:33,053 --> 01:25:34,930
from inside a dead shark.

1354
01:25:39,017 --> 01:25:41,987
Nobody can save you from that.

1355
01:25:46,984 --> 01:25:50,329
The spirit lives on after the body,
don't you know that?

1356
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:53,281
But it can be trapped.

1357
01:25:53,282 --> 01:25:58,880
It screams out in pain
and there's no-one there to hear it.

1358
01:26:02,541 --> 01:26:04,794
A mother never stops hearing it.

1359
01:26:07,963 --> 01:26:12,133
Her spirit's gotta be in the ocean
where she died.

1360
01:26:12,134 --> 01:26:14,387
I've got to get it outta me head.

1361
01:26:18,265 --> 01:26:19,812
Come on.

1362
01:26:31,695 --> 01:26:33,197
You promised me.

1363
01:26:37,284 --> 01:26:39,252
He knows you're coming, Shaz.

1364
01:26:41,121 --> 01:26:45,791
Get out of here... while you still can.
Go, Shaz!

1365
01:26:45,792 --> 01:26:47,385
Please.

1366
01:26:49,963 --> 01:26:51,554
Don't you know what it's like

1367
01:26:51,555 --> 01:26:54,347
to care for someone
more than you care for yourself?

1368
01:27:02,184 --> 01:27:03,606
Ripper.

1369
01:28:09,793 --> 01:28:11,761
Stay back, love. Stay out of it.

1370
01:28:13,672 --> 01:28:16,175
Don't hurt her! Please, no!

1371
01:28:19,177 --> 01:28:20,724
Could we have lunch this Friday?

1372
01:28:23,181 --> 01:28:25,024
Or afternoon tea?

1373
01:28:41,783 --> 01:28:43,618
- Dad's home!

1374
01:28:53,587 --> 01:28:55,254
G'day!

1375
01:28:55,255 --> 01:28:58,549
- Mrs Moochmore.
- Yes.

1376
01:28:58,550 --> 01:29:00,223
Trevor Blundell.

1377
01:29:02,304 --> 01:29:05,681
Coral's employer... former employer.

1378
01:29:05,682 --> 01:29:07,307
Sorry, luv, ya out of a job.

1379
01:29:07,308 --> 01:29:10,358
I'm closin' the shark show.
Takin' off tonight. Cheers, luv.

1380
01:29:15,984 --> 01:29:18,861
You all feel bad about Shaz, I know.

1381
01:29:18,862 --> 01:29:21,035
But ya done the right thing.

1382
01:29:22,824 --> 01:29:27,953
They'll let 'er out. They always do.
Then it starts again.

1383
01:29:27,954 --> 01:29:30,002
Why don't ya just give 'er the shark?

1384
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:38,678
She never gets that shark.

1385
01:29:40,217 --> 01:29:42,263
She never gets to forget what she done.

1386
01:29:42,264 --> 01:29:45,432
- What did she do?
- She looked the other way!

1387
01:29:45,433 --> 01:29:48,684
<i>She wants to protect Grace now!
Where was she then?</i>

1388
01:29:53,438 --> 01:29:55,106
Maybe she'll die.

1389
01:29:55,107 --> 01:29:59,068
There's a possibility.

1390
01:29:59,069 --> 01:30:01,445
She can't take another 12 months
searchin' for me.

1391
01:30:01,446 --> 01:30:03,995
It'll kill 'er. Or she'll kill 'erself.

1392
01:30:03,996 --> 01:30:05,908
Shaz would never do that.

1393
01:30:07,994 --> 01:30:09,917
That a fact?

1394
01:30:12,457 --> 01:30:14,926
A little girl once told me
she jumped off a verandah

1395
01:30:14,927 --> 01:30:18,295
'cause she didn't like
the look of her own face.

1396
01:30:18,296 --> 01:30:21,632
Imagine it that little girl knew
real pain.

1397
01:30:21,633 --> 01:30:25,308
Grief. Despair.

1398
01:30:27,472 --> 01:30:29,520
Maybe she'd cut 'er throat too.

1399
01:30:31,268 --> 01:30:33,519
Yeah.

1400
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:35,938
Or her wrists.

1401
01:30:35,939 --> 01:30:37,939
Or try to hang herself in the bathroom

1402
01:30:37,940 --> 01:30:39,568
with the elastic from her pyjamas.

1403
01:30:43,697 --> 01:30:47,747
Maybe this time we'll be lucky,
and there'll be no five-minute checks

1404
01:30:47,748 --> 01:30:49,711
and we can all be free.

1405
01:31:14,311 --> 01:31:17,021
I 'ad a family.

1406
01:31:17,022 --> 01:31:21,778
We used to sit around a table
and talk about things.

1407
01:31:24,112 --> 01:31:25,864
The future.

1408
01:31:30,118 --> 01:31:32,212
We had it all.

1409
01:31:34,956 --> 01:31:36,799
We just didn't know it.

1410
01:32:01,775 --> 01:32:03,317

G'day, Shirley. How was Wollongong?

1423
01:32:54,493 --> 01:32:57,043
I wouldn't know, Jack,
I was in a mental hospital.

1424

1425
01:32:59,666 --> 01:33:02,960

1427

for a special occasion.

1444
01:34:18,119 --> 01:34:20,162
Your very own waterfall.

1445

1446
01:34:22,165 --> 01:34:24,257
Pushed it through the council
last year.

1447
01:34:24,258 --> 01:34:26,501
It's in the rainforest
near Mount Warning.

1448
01:34:26,502 --> 01:34:30,553

the road - if you use a machete.

1453
01:34:47,899 --> 01:34:50,823
I fell, deep in a forest.

1454
01:34:52,737 --> 01:34:54,990
And there was no-one there
to hear me.
