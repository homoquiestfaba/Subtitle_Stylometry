Jonathan Jones.

You haven't done much, but
Rachel thinks you're hot shit.

every cute guy in a suit

- [Jonathan] Oh, I'm from Kentucky.

00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,650
- Kentucky, nice.

28
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,840
So do you have any questions
about the role, Jonathan?

- No, no, I, no.

00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,317

- Oh, sure.

00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,310
Yeah. (clears throat)

35
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,850
Hi, I'm Jonathan Jones with
the Rachel Green Talent Agency,

36
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,663
and I'm reading for the role of Max.

37
00:03:22,547 --> 00:03:23,380
Thank you.

00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:27,530

00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,193
- And are you ready?

40
00:03:30,365 --> 00:03:34,830
- Just let me just take
a second to just...

41
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,173
Uh, get out, me.

42
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,190
Oh, I got it.

43
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,023
Yeah.

44
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,680
- Action, when did you get out, Max?

45
00:03:44,696 --> 00:03:45,529
- I...

46
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:47,180
(foreboding music)

47
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,100
I graduated last week.

48
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,740
- Mm-hm.

49
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,410
What took you so long to come and see me?

50
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,270
- Well, I...

51
00:03:55,982 --> 00:03:58,063
I, I've been looking for Lucy.

52
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,560
- Looking for Lucy, I told you that skirt

53
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,933
was trouble from day one.

54
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,670
I hope she was worth
five years on the Rock.

55
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,913
- Well, uh...

56
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,883
Maybe I should ask you, Stan.

57
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,103
- Why me?

58
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:18,743
- Why you?

59
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,900
I'll tell you why you.

60
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:22,803
You, uh...

61
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,160
You set me up on that
payroll heist, payroll heist.

62
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,790
And you kept the score to yourselves.

63
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,740
- Who put that crazy idea in your head?

64
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,690
- [Jonathan] The Creeper.

65
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,881
He told me just before I deposited
three slugs in his chest.

66
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:42,330
- (clears throat) Now don't
go getting twisted, Max.

67
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,910
You got it all wrong, I had nothing to do

68
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:44,910
with you going over.

69
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:46,883
- Oh yeah?

70
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,080
Well that's not what Lucy told me.

71
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,453
Yeah, before I deposited her
body in San Francisco Bay.

72
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,180
- You won't shoot, Max.

73
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,870
The boys downstairs will burn you down.

74
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,703
- I don't care.

75
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:07,020
(mimics gun firing)

76
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,040
- Put your gun away.

77
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,847
So, Jonathan, what did you do

78
00:05:12,847 --> 00:05:15,853
before you had the big
brainstorm to become an actor?

79
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,513
- I worked at Costco.

80
00:05:21,986 --> 00:05:23,720
- (scoffs) Costco?

81
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,063
Wow, another one.

82
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,060
- Costco, shit.

83
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,570
Well, I got some free advice for you.

84
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,550
I want you to get on a bus

85
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,560
and hurry back to Tennessee, Johnny boy.

86
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,590
- I, I'm from Kentucky.

87
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,530
Look, just, just let me do it again, okay?

88
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,620
I can do a much better job.

89
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,803
- No, you already wasted enough of my day.

90
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,270
- I don't understand.
- Johnny--

91
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,789
- [Jonathan] I mean,
Rachel said I was great.

92
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:50,540
(chuckles)
- I bet she did.

93
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,620
- Johnny, here's the deal, buddy.

94
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,490
Max, this guy you was reading.

95
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,438
He is a man's man.

96
00:05:57,438 --> 00:06:00,090
(grunts) Marlon Brando, man's man.

97
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:03,072
And Johnny boy, you just ain't.

98
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:06,020
(foreboding music)

99
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,293
You blew it the moment
you walked in the door.

100
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,430
You should've looked me in
the eye, struck fear into me.

101
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,870
But instead you looked to the floor,

102
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,030
you avoided eye contact.

103
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,650
You didn't even comment on Missy's ass.

104
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,237
She got a great ass.

105
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,130
Send in the next victim, Johnny boy.

106
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:24,963
- Okay.

107
00:06:28,603 --> 00:06:29,700
- Hey.

108
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,920
I like your tie, keep the tie.

109
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,753
- Thank you.

110
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:37,770
Nice glasses and shoes.

111
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:38,620

00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,660

149
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,042
Get it?

150
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:41,833

(dramatic jazz music)

189
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,433
- Are you ready?

190
00:10:48,925 --> 00:10:49,758
- Always.

191
00:10:56,771 --> 00:10:59,271
(Missy moans)

192
00:11:05,849 --> 00:11:08,010
- Missy, I need a favor.

193
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:11,060
Christ, I figured you'd be halfway back

194
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,903
to Chickenshit Falls,
Arkansas by now, Johnny boy.

195
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,640
- Oh no, no, no.

196
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,473
It's Kentucky.

197
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,183
- Whatever.

198
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,840
Sweet cheeks, do me a favor.

199
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,260
Take that fine behind of
yours down to the liquor store

200
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,700
and grab me another bottle.

201
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,340
- Sure thing.
- Go, go, go.

202
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,973
Mm, nice, nice.

203
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,850
All right, so Rachel tells me

204
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:41,120
she won't send me any more talent

205
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:46,000
til we have this callback, so
let's get started, all right?

206
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,430
Are you ready?

207
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,917
And action.

208
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,720
(tense jazz music)

209
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,920
When'd you get out, Max?

210
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:57,413
- I graduated last week, Stan.

211
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,513
- What took you so long to come see me?

212
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,620
- Well, I, I've been looking for Lucy.

213
00:12:10,387 --> 00:12:12,837
- I told you that skirt
was trouble from day one.

214
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,263
Hope she was worth five
years in the joint.

215
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,530
- Maybe I should ask you, Stan.

216
00:12:22,027 --> 00:12:23,510
- Why me?

217
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:27,500
- Cause it was you two that
set me up on the payroll heist,

218
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,450
and you kept the score to yourselves.

219
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,803
- Now how did you get that
crazy idea in your head?

220
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,380
- Creeper, yeah.

221
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,483
He told me just before I deposited
three slugs in his chest.

222
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,263
- Now don't get it all twisted,
Max, you got this all wrong!

223
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,590
I had nothing to do with you going over.

224
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,260
- That's not what Lucy told me

225
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,443
before I dumped her body
in the San Francisco Bay.

226
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,510
- You won't shoot, Max.

227
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,840
My boys downstairs will burn you down.

228
00:13:01,069 --> 00:13:04,140
(chuckles)

229
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,243
- I don't care, Stan.

230
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,201
- That was great fucking acting!

231
00:13:13,201 --> 00:13:14,731
(gun fires)

232
00:13:14,731 --> 00:13:16,590
- Shit, you shot me!

233
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,526
You shot me.

234
00:13:18,526 --> 00:13:19,753
- You know what, Stan?

235
00:13:19,753 --> 00:13:21,934
(suspenseful music)

236
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:24,625
I don't like playing the sap.

237
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:25,946
- No, no.

238
00:13:25,946 --> 00:13:27,687
No, are you crazy?

239
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:30,020
(gun fires)

240
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,400
Say goodnight.

241
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,893
Sweet dreams, Stan.

242
00:13:47,218 --> 00:13:49,983
(thunder rumbles)

243
00:13:49,983 --> 00:13:53,066
(ominous jazz music)

244
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,810
- Hey, Johnny boy.

245
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:56,710
How did the audition go?

246
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,543
- Great.

247
00:13:58,930 --> 00:13:59,763
I killed it.

248
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,580
(door closes)

249
00:14:12,455 --> 00:14:15,122
(Missy screams)

250
00:14:16,371 --> 00:14:21,371
(bell tolls)
(sinister voice laughs)

251
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,293
- So how are things at Fillmore Casting?

252
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,893
- You mean Missy Fillmore Casting.

253
00:14:34,142 --> 00:14:37,503
(sighs) With the insurance
money for my late hubby,

254
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,500
I am going to become the
biggest casting agency in town.

255
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,700
How do you think I feel?

256
00:14:45,022 --> 00:14:47,900
(sighs) Like a million bucks.

257
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,733
- Wonderful.

258
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:54,530
So what about that guy
you wanna set me up with?

259
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,910
- Oh.

260
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,693
You are going to enjoy him, Priscilla.

261
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,380
- You think so?

262
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,860
- I know so.

263
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,470
- Are you speaking from
personal experience?

264
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:08,350
- No, but I know what you like.

265
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,540
- He's, he's intense.

266
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:14,604
But under the surface,
he's bursting with fear.

267
00:15:14,604 --> 00:15:15,771
- I love fear.

268
00:15:16,713 --> 00:15:19,110
Fear is oh so sweet.

269
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:19,943
- Priscilla.

270
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:25,450
With my offering, am I
gonna gain passage now?

271
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:28,941
- Praying Mantis requires much
more than your gift, Missy.

272
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:30,210
(ominous music)

273
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:33,790
- I am ready, mind, body and soul.

274
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,300
- Are you?

275
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,820
Because once you cross
over, there's no going back.

276
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,323
Praying Mantis, it changes you.

277
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,193
- I understand.

278
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:51,027
- We'll talk about it
after I've seen your gift.

279
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,730
- You promise?

280
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,223
- Yes, I promise.

281
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:57,903
(line beeps)
Oh, hold on, dear.

282
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,053
It's him.

283
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,710
Hello?

284
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,710
- Is this Priscilla?

285
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,230
- Hi, you must be J J.

286
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,063
- Yeah.

287
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,800
- Oh, wonderful.

288
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,633
I've heard a lot about you.

289
00:16:15,633 --> 00:16:18,500
- Well, I wish I knew
who told you about me.

290
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,230
- It's a secret, do you like secrets?

291
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,063
- Sometimes.

292
00:16:22,063 --> 00:16:24,290
Are we still on for tonight?

293
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,203
- Of course.

294
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:31,560
I was thinking of a
Carpaccio Surprise for dinner

295
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,393
after our session.

296
00:16:32,393 --> 00:16:34,480
- Oh, sounds good.

297
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,553
What's the surprise?

298
00:16:36,553 --> 00:16:39,550
- There's no surprise in the telling.

299
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,210
I'll text you my address.

300
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,913
8 P M and don't be late.

301
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,503
I punish men who are tardy.

302
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,310
- I need to be punished.

303
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:51,327
I've been a very bad boy.

304
00:16:51,327 --> 00:16:54,217
- (chuckles) Wonderful, see you tonight.

305
00:16:54,217 --> 00:16:55,050
Ciao.

306
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,980
Missy?

307
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,843
- Was it him?

308
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,933
- Yes, we're having dinner tonight.

309
00:17:07,024 --> 00:17:08,380
(sighs)

310
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,213
- Oh.

311
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,083
I just wish I could be there.

312
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:17,000
- Patience is always rewarded, my dear.

313
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,853
- Priscilla.

314
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,533
Tell me about your first time again.

315
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,902
- [Priscilla] I'll tell
you all the juicy details

316
00:17:26,902 --> 00:17:27,854

- Great, I killed it.

342
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,853
- My world is not so easily rocked, J J.

343
00:21:06,082 --> 00:21:09,665
- Oh, I've never disappointed a lady yet.

344
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:15,307
- I'm no ordinary lady.

345
00:21:22,265 --> 00:21:23,098
- Yeah.

346
00:21:24,337 --> 00:21:25,920
Mm, I can see that.

347
00:21:36,334 --> 00:21:38,631

00:22:03,103 --> 00:22:03,936
Fuck.

355
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:15,076
- My desires may be a bit more unusual

356
00:22:15,076 --> 00:22:16,743
than you're used to.

357
00:22:20,577 --> 00:22:22,077

You're going to taste so good.

368
00:23:52,755 --> 00:23:53,644
(groans)

369
00:23:53,644 --> 00:23:56,644
(suspenseful music)

370
00:24:03,893 --> 00:24:05,774
(snarls)

371
00:24:05,774 --> 00:24:07,774
(moans)

372
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,470
- Hey Priscilla.

373
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,593
How was your date with J J last night?

374
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,425
- Delicious, I ate him up.

375
00:25:12,425 --> 00:25:15,091
(ominous music)

376
00:25:15,091 --> 00:25:19,508
- Well, I have the perfect offering.

377
00:25:41,318 --> 00:25:44,651
(sinister voice laughs)

378
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,076
(foreboding music)

379
00:26:03,052 --> 00:26:04,618
(static buzzes)

380
00:26:04,618 --> 00:26:08,118
(sinister voice whispers)

381
00:26:09,304 --> 00:26:11,554
(grunting)

382
00:26:18,254 --> 00:26:20,754
(woman yelps)

383
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:29,875
(ominous chanting)

384
00:26:36,274 --> 00:26:39,857
- [Sinister Voice]
Bring their souls to me.

385
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,697
(woman screams)

386
00:26:52,697 --> 00:26:55,270
- [Carlos] The lord is my shepherd.

387
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,113
I lack nothing.

388
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,760
He makes me lie down in green pastures.

389
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,340
He leads me beside quiet waters.

390
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,813
He refreshes my soul.

391
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:11,280
He guides me along the right
paths for his name's sake.

392
00:27:17,008 --> 00:27:18,578
(sinister voice growls)

393
00:27:18,578 --> 00:27:21,495
(unsettling music)

394
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:35,802
(grunts)

395
00:27:57,394 --> 00:27:58,504
(eerie music)

396
00:27:58,504 --> 00:28:00,925
- [Announcer] Tonight's
Halloween Thriller,

397
00:28:00,925 --> 00:28:04,842
"Thursday the 12th in 3D".

398
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:08,253
- Hold still, Donald.

399
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,144
Why can't you get a better wig?

400
00:28:10,144 --> 00:28:11,561
- It's not a wig.

401
00:28:12,552 --> 00:28:14,552
- I like your whip.

402
00:28:15,714 --> 00:28:16,881
I'm Priscilla.

403
00:28:18,367 --> 00:28:19,283
- Yes you are.

404
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,509
- Another glass of red, Count?

405
00:28:26,509 --> 00:28:27,509
- Certainly.

406
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,890
- Give me a call in a few hours

407
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:36,199
and we'll see what you
can do with that whip.

408
00:28:36,199 --> 00:28:39,111
- Well let's get cracking.

409
00:28:39,111 --> 00:28:41,503
- People say poor Melania.

410
00:28:41,503 --> 00:28:45,521
I strong, Donald, I very strong.

411
00:28:45,521 --> 00:28:47,150
- Wrong, yes, dear.

412
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:49,150
(moans)

413
00:28:50,218 --> 00:28:52,468
- Leaving so soon, darling?

414
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,665
- This party sucks.

415
00:28:55,665 --> 00:28:56,665
I'm leaving.

416
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:00,145
- Such a nasty woman.
- Mm-hm.

417
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:06,617
(ominous choral music)

418
00:29:40,055 --> 00:29:42,055
(gasps)

419
00:29:44,797 --> 00:29:47,880
(groans in distress)

420
00:29:54,745 --> 00:29:56,229
(tense music)

421
00:29:56,229 --> 00:30:00,979
- [Carlos] Even though I walk
through the darkest valley,

422
00:30:01,968 --> 00:30:03,635
I will fear no evil.

423
00:30:05,288 --> 00:30:08,105
For you are with me.

424
00:30:08,105 --> 00:30:12,688
And I will dwell in the
house of the Lord forever.

425
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:31,839
(suspenseful music)

426
00:30:35,948 --> 00:30:37,676
- The body of Priscilla
Mantis was discovered

427
00:30:37,676 --> 00:30:39,690
in this alleyway in the
early hours this morning.

428
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:42,480
Ms. Mantis' death has
been strongly alleged

429
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,510
by detectives to not be
connected to the L A Strangler.

430
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,650
The L A Strangler, who has
been murdering and raping women

431
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,830
for the last 20 years every Halloween

432
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:52,230
in spite of the biggest manhunt in L A,

433
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,390
has not been caught.

434
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,970
Here with us today, Ms. Fillmore,

435
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:57,380
to talk a little bit about her friend.

436
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,110
What can you tell us about Ms. Mantis?

437
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,530
- Oh my god, um...

438
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,350
Who could do such a horrible thing?

439
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:09,940
I mean, Priscilla was the sweetest,

440
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,550
most wonderful woman I've ever known.

441
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:15,543
And she wouldn't hurt a fly.

442
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,703
What is the world coming to?

443
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,590
- [Jennifer] I'm very sorry for your loss.

444
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,880
This is Jennifer Fox reporting live.

445
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,629
Back to you, Bob.

446
00:31:26,629 --> 00:31:28,491
- [Bob] Well, it's a wet one.

447
00:31:28,491 --> 00:31:32,290
Looks like nothing but rain
in the forecast, Angelinos.

448
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,540
Sure enough to dry up soon.

449
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:39,354
(sinister voice laughs)

450
00:31:41,471 --> 00:31:43,888
(bell tolls)

451
00:31:45,655 --> 00:31:48,738
(somber organ music)

452
00:32:05,463 --> 00:32:08,963
- Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

453
00:32:09,903 --> 00:32:12,403
- [Priest] What is the
nature of your sin, my son?

454
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:19,466
- I would walk home from school

455
00:32:21,722 --> 00:32:26,543
and find my mother in my bed.

456
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,220
Always a different man.

457
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:36,453
Sometimes they would beat me with belts.

458
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,970
It hurt at first.

459
00:32:42,602 --> 00:32:47,602
But with time, feel good.

460
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,713
As I grow up, I discovered my power.

461
00:32:56,973 --> 00:32:59,860
With my hands, I could control.

462
00:33:02,872 --> 00:33:03,705
Mm-hm.

463
00:33:04,673 --> 00:33:07,921
Cleanse the earth of the
vermin and the filth.

464
00:33:07,921 --> 00:33:08,754
Si.

465
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:10,445
Si, Padre.

466
00:33:12,293 --> 00:33:14,876
Finish the work of a great man.

467
00:33:16,213 --> 00:33:17,546
Finish his work.

468
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:21,400
And together, we write our legacy.

469
00:33:27,183 --> 00:33:30,050
If only this day would last forever.

470
00:33:34,984 --> 00:33:37,401
(bell tolls)

471
00:33:42,205 --> 00:33:45,772
(ominous organ music)

472
00:33:45,772 --> 00:33:47,649
- [Priest] Patience, my son,

473
00:33:47,649 --> 00:33:50,990
for we always have next Halloween.

474
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,073
(laughs)

475
00:33:56,182 --> 00:33:57,599
- Si, Father.

476
00:33:59,345 --> 00:34:03,012
(speaking foreign language)

477
00:34:11,065 --> 00:34:14,398
(sinister voice laughs)

478
00:34:20,238 --> 00:34:23,155
(foreboding music)

479
00:34:26,911 --> 00:34:28,593
- [Newscaster] With
insufficient information

480
00:34:28,593 --> 00:34:30,941
to confirm it is the same virus.

481
00:34:30,941 --> 00:34:33,912
But after a month, only
a few dozen Americans

482
00:34:33,912 --> 00:34:35,793
have tested positive for the ailment

483
00:34:35,793 --> 00:34:39,520
that has caused great concern
at the CDC in Atlanta.

484
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,130
We now go to Carrie Weems

485
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:43,870
at Mercy General Hospital
with the latest news.

486
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:46,606
- [Carrie] Yes, this is
Carrie Weems reporting live.

487
00:34:46,606 --> 00:34:50,099
In the last 48 hours another dozen people,

488
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:52,449
mostly vagrants from the downtown area,

489
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:53,880
have arrived by ambulance.

490
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:57,761
From what I can see, a number
of them have bloody wounds

491
00:34:57,761 --> 00:34:59,990
that resemble bite wounds.

492
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:03,110
Whether these wounds were
inflicted by animals or humans

493
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:05,960
has not been confirmed by any
of the medical staff here.

494
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,040
I did manage to grab a nearby
E R doctor to get the latest.

495
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,410
- [Doctor] I've never encountered anything

496
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,023
quite like this in 20 years.

497
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:17,320
Within an hour anyone
bitten has become deranged

498
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,279
and almost uncontrollable.

499
00:35:19,279 --> 00:35:21,079
(moans)

500
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:22,403
- [Brandy] Hey.

501
00:35:22,403 --> 00:35:24,480
- Hey, momma, hey.

502
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,182
- Hey, pappy.
- I wanna get my party on.

503
00:35:27,182 --> 00:35:30,042
- Ah, love to party.

504
00:35:30,042 --> 00:35:32,330
- What you think?
- What you got?

505
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,180
What else you got,
that's not gonna cut it.

506
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,042
Give me more.

507
00:35:35,042 --> 00:35:37,110
- Come on, Daddy's hurting.
- Come on, give me more.

508
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,120
Oh yeah, wanna help you.

509
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,980
I wanna help you, but give me more, okay?

510
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,160
Yo.
- Come here.

511
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:43,993
Give me some.

512
00:35:43,993 --> 00:35:45,599
- Yeah, really, is that
how you wanna play?

513
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:46,730
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

514
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,313
- Whoa, oh, oh, oh.

515
00:35:49,269 --> 00:35:50,936
Come here, yeah?

516
00:36:02,405 --> 00:36:05,655
(electricity crackles)

517
00:36:12,977 --> 00:36:15,477
(tense music)

518
00:36:26,548 --> 00:36:28,378
- Carlos Ochoa?

519
00:36:28,378 --> 00:36:31,711
(Carlos shouts in pain)

520
00:36:37,186 --> 00:36:39,269
(grunts)

521
00:36:55,444 --> 00:36:58,361
(foreboding music)

522
00:37:00,404 --> 00:37:03,654
(electricity crackles)

523
00:37:07,447 --> 00:37:09,530
(grunts)

524
00:37:16,638 --> 00:37:18,206
- What is this?

525
00:37:18,206 --> 00:37:19,456
What are you doing to me?

526
00:37:22,036 --> 00:37:23,358
Help!

527
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:25,941
(grunts) Help!

528
00:37:27,766 --> 00:37:28,599
Help me!

529
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:31,033
- No need to yell.

530
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,777
- I don't understand this.

531
00:37:33,777 --> 00:37:35,357
What is this shit?

532
00:37:35,357 --> 00:37:36,274
Where am I?

533
00:37:40,646 --> 00:37:41,563
Where am I?

534
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,263
- Save it.

535
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,503
No one can hear you.

536
00:37:47,294 --> 00:37:49,070
You're the Carlos Ochoa
who killed that prostitute

537
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,750
three months ago.

538
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:53,120
- [Carlos] I had nothing to do with that.

539
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,006
- You really did a number
on that poor woman.

540
00:37:56,006 --> 00:37:58,966
- I had nothing to do with that, Jack.

541
00:37:58,966 --> 00:38:01,549
(device beeps)

542
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:03,973
- Yeah?

543
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,610
What happened to those two prostitutes

544
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:08,787
you killed in Sacramento a year ago?

545
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:11,488
- I had nothing to do with that.

546
00:38:11,488 --> 00:38:12,538
(device beeps)
- No?

547
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:15,080
Police arrested you for the killings.

548
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,130
- But they let me go.

549
00:38:17,539 --> 00:38:20,960
Lack of evidence, my friend.

550
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,050
- So you're telling me you
didn't kill them either.

551
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:26,020
- That's right, I did not kill them.

552
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,435
I never kill anyone.

553
00:38:27,435 --> 00:38:28,690
(device beeps)
So now

554
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,413
you are going to untie me.

555
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,313
Huh, come on.

556
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:36,023
Come on!

557
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,620
- You know what this is?

558
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:41,486
It's a voice stress analyzer.

559
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:42,540
(hisses)

560
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,940
Kind of like a lie detector.

561
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:47,957
That beep means you just lied to me.

562
00:38:51,212 --> 00:38:55,380
- But this, this is not admissible

563
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:59,460
in the court, senor.

564
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,795
- Oh, they are in my court.

565
00:39:00,795 --> 00:39:03,100
- This is bullshit, man.

566
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:03,943
Bullshit!

567
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,550
Now you untie me, huh?

568
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:08,923
This is kidnapping.

569
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,710
- It's worse than that, Carlos.

570
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,513
Much worse.

571
00:39:18,126 --> 00:39:18,959
- Okay.

572
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:21,708
Okay.

573
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,230
- I'm sorry it's come to this.

574
00:39:27,334 --> 00:39:29,553
But you have to understand,
I have no choice.

575
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:34,500
I made a vow to her,
and I mean to keep it.

576
00:39:37,686 --> 00:39:39,955
- A vow?

577
00:39:39,955 --> 00:39:40,820
To who?

578
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,840
- My wife!

579
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,090
- I never meet your wife!

580
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,150
- You're about to.

581
00:39:52,235 --> 00:39:55,152
(foreboding music)

582
00:39:56,064 --> 00:39:57,656
(rattling)

583
00:39:57,656 --> 00:39:59,406
- What is this noise?

584
00:40:00,672 --> 00:40:02,422
- Ever been married before, Carlos?

585
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,763
When you get married, you
make your vows to each other.

586
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:11,540
These days most people
make light of those vows.

587
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,943
Beth and I meant ours.

588
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,070
We really meant them.

589
00:40:22,157 --> 00:40:25,074
- Cut me loose, bastard.

590
00:40:26,153 --> 00:40:28,363
Cut me loose, cut me loose.

591
00:40:30,539 --> 00:40:33,500
- To have and to hold,
from this day forward.

592
00:40:36,091 --> 00:40:37,243
For better, for worse.

593
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,057
For richer, for poorer.

594
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,080
In sickness and in health.

595
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:45,993
Until death do us part.

596
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,123
In sickness, Carlos.

597
00:40:54,872 --> 00:40:57,312
(Beth groans)

598
00:40:57,312 --> 00:40:59,390
She got the Omega Retrovirus
while we were in Asia

599
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,403
a couple months ago.

600
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:04,123
It should've been me, not her.

601
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:08,910
You do know what the Omega
Retrovirus is, don't you, Carlos?

602
00:41:09,771 --> 00:41:10,871
It's been in the news.

603
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,000
Some people call it the Z-Virus.

604
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:17,993
The Zombie Virus.

605
00:41:19,491 --> 00:41:20,491
- Shit, man.

606
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,583
Are you crazy?

607
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:25,774
Cut me loose.

608
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:27,893
I will scream.

609
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:32,502
(screams) Hey, hey, help me!

610
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:35,763
- This room is soundproof, Carlos.

611
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,592
Scream all you want.

612
00:41:38,592 --> 00:41:39,942
Just like your victims did.

613
00:41:42,643 --> 00:41:44,080
(Carlos yelps)
(Beth growls)

614
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:44,913
- Okay.

615
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,080
You want me, I killed them.

616
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,392
I killed them all, okay?

617
00:41:50,392 --> 00:41:52,240
Please, please.

618
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,440
(growls)

619
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,133
- They say they're working on a cure.

620
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:01,457
I pray every night they come up with one.

621
00:42:05,138 --> 00:42:07,971
(screams in pain)

622
00:42:10,103 --> 00:42:11,353
God forgive me.

623
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:29,123
(sinister voice laughs)

624
00:42:30,053 --> 00:42:33,386
(whimsical piano music)

625
00:42:46,853 --> 00:42:49,170
Such a sweet old couple.

626
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:52,094
It's a shame they can't
keep their room rented.

627
00:42:52,094 --> 00:42:52,927

00:43:21,147 --> 00:43:23,376
I found a room for you to rent.

634
00:43:23,376 --> 00:43:25,879
It's, it's cute.

635
00:43:25,879 --> 00:43:27,150

636
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:29,610

638
00:43:45,736 --> 00:43:49,440
- When's that gal coming
by to look at the room?

639
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,290
- Said she'd be here at nine o'clock.

640
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:55,043
- And you told her it's a shared home?

641
00:43:56,125 --> 00:43:57,290
- I did.

642
00:43:57,290 --> 00:43:59,500
Told her our son works
away most of the time

643
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,133
and is here maybe once a month.

644
00:44:02,045 --> 00:44:03,045
- That's good, dear.

645
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:06,050
- She said that sounded perfect to her

646
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:07,650
and the rent was more than fair.

647
00:44:11,387 --> 00:44:12,653
- I hope she likes it.

648
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:16,867
I'm gonna go clean up the room for her.

- No need to explain, dear.

662
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:34,013
I use it myself for my lower back.

663
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:36,470
- Cool.

664
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:38,840
- I'm Irene Kohn.

665
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,550
- Very nice to meet you, Irene.

666
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:41,940
I'm Catharine.

667
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,480
My friends call me Cat.
(Irene chuckles)

668
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,810
And you must be Jacob.

669
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:48,550
- Right, we spoke on the phone.

670
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:49,853
- [Cat] Yes, we did.

671
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,210
- Well, would you like to
come inside and see the room?

672
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,500
It's getting a little chilly out here.

673
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:58,333
- Absolutely, let's do it.

674
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:17,203
- Do you want some hot tea or cocoa?

675
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:18,960
(Cat chuckles)

676
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,923
- She makes the best cocoa.

677
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,340
- Um...

678
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,330
- Jacob's been drinking
it for fifty years,

679
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:27,030
it ain't killed him yet.

680
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:28,060
(Cat giggles)

681
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:29,800
- That's good.

682
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,340
Well, yes, why not?

683
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:33,950
I caught a chill outside.

684
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:36,161
- I'll get something warm to drink.

685
00:46:36,161 --> 00:46:37,758
- Have a seat, Cat.

686
00:46:37,758 --> 00:46:39,258
- [Cat] Thank you.

687
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:46,360
- So where'd you see our ad for the room?

688
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,243
I forgot to ask.

689
00:46:48,841 --> 00:46:51,780
- Actually, a friend of mine
saw the ad out in your yard

690
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,193
and texted me your number.

691
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:59,030
- Ah, see, I told you those
internet ads didn't do any good!

692
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:00,190
- Yes, dear.

693
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:02,857
(ominous music)

694
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,220
- [Cat] That's a lovely picture.

695
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:10,313
- Thank you.

696
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:13,153
Be careful, it's hot.

697
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:19,850
- Is that your son in the picture?

698
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:21,313
- [Irene] Our pride and joy.

699
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:29,839
- He's very handsome.

700
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:31,380
- Yeah.

701
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:34,230
I don't know where he got his
looks, sure wasn't from me.

702
00:47:35,588 --> 00:47:38,020
(giggles)

703
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,150
- How old is the picture?

704
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:41,513
- Oh, a couple of years old.

705
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:49,073
Well, you ready to go look at the room?

706
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:51,053
- Oh, yes.

707
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:53,800
Sorry if I talked too much.

708
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,700
You guys just make me feel so at home.

709
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:00,263
- Right this way, Cat.

710
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:10,200
- How long have you been painting?

711
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,480
- Oh, neither of us can paint.

712
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,853
Our son's been working on a self portrait.

713
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:18,273
Been working on it for a while.

714
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:21,130
Not finished yet.

715
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:22,920
- (chuckles) That's cool.

716
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,093
I love to paint myself.

717
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,473
- Right this way.

718
00:48:32,042 --> 00:48:33,692
(singer screams aggressively)

719
00:48:33,692 --> 00:48:36,692
(heavy metal music)

720
00:49:01,843 --> 00:49:03,760
- So what do you think?

721
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:07,510
Utilities are included
like I said on the phone.

722
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:09,300
Fully furnished.

723
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,041
Son's room's just down the hall,

724
00:49:11,041 --> 00:49:13,391
but like I said on the
phone, he's seldom here.

725
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:16,123
- Very cozy.

726
00:49:17,347 --> 00:49:20,494
- I cleaned and swept it for you earlier.

727
00:49:20,494 --> 00:49:23,730
(phone rings)

728
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:24,853
Please excuse me.

729
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,310
Hello?

730
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:39,120
- [Matthew] Mother, I've come home.

731
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,203
I'm hungry.

732
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,625
- Oh dear.

733
00:49:42,625 --> 00:49:45,542
(foreboding music)

734
00:49:56,427 --> 00:49:58,760
(dog barks)

735
00:50:09,488 --> 00:50:12,238
(Matthew snarls)

736
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:41,400
- Do you have an application
for me to fill out?

737
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,420
- Oh, not as such.

738
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,763
Just write down your last address.

739
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:49,063
Name of the person you last stayed with.

740
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,441
What, Irene?

741
00:50:52,441 --> 00:50:54,441
- It's just--
- What?

742
00:50:56,264 --> 00:50:57,694
- Our son just called.

743
00:50:57,694 --> 00:50:59,611
He's around the corner.

744
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:03,433
- Uh, I see.

745
00:51:04,342 --> 00:51:06,799
Catharine, I, we--

746
00:51:06,799 --> 00:51:08,221
- [Cat] Oh, no problem.

747
00:51:08,221 --> 00:51:11,021
It'll be nice to meet him, I'm sure.

748
00:51:11,021 --> 00:51:13,059
(doorbell rings)

749
00:51:13,059 --> 00:51:16,119
- [Irene] It's him, he's here.

750
00:51:16,119 --> 00:51:18,188
- I'll answer it.

751
00:51:18,188 --> 00:51:21,105
(foreboding music)

752
00:51:41,256 --> 00:51:44,086
(Matthew growls)

753
00:51:44,086 --> 00:51:45,135
(screams)

754
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:48,826
(suspenseful music)

755
00:51:48,826 --> 00:51:50,909
- Matthew, stop!

756
00:51:52,366 --> 00:51:54,699
(claws rip)

757
00:52:01,067 --> 00:52:02,370
- [Jacob] Cut it out, son!

758
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:04,510
You do this to us every month!

759
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:05,410
- [Irene] Oh dear.

760
00:52:08,167 --> 00:52:10,834
(Matthew howls)

761
00:52:16,068 --> 00:52:17,752
(whimsical piano music)

762
00:52:17,752 --> 00:52:20,252
(hammer taps)

763
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:27,070
- Oh, I thought they'd
have it rented by now.

764
00:52:33,232 --> 00:52:35,939
- [Matthew] Ma, what's for breakfast?

765
00:52:35,939 --> 00:52:37,356
I'm hungry again!

766
00:52:40,037 --> 00:52:45,037
(bell tolls)
(sinister voice laughs)

767
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:49,045
(helicopter blades whir)

768
00:52:49,045 --> 00:52:52,921
(paramedics chatter)

769
00:52:52,921 --> 00:52:56,237
(emergency sirens wail)

770
00:52:56,237 --> 00:52:57,540
- What's all this?

771
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:58,870
Somebody die?

772
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:00,200
- Mr. Torrecelli.

773
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,060
He was an artist who
lived on the third floor.

774
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:04,733
- Yeah, what happened?

775
00:53:04,733 --> 00:53:06,610
- Well the manager says it was suicide.

776
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:09,690
Somebody else, they said
he might have been killed.

777
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:11,283
- Killed?
- Killed.

778
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:14,090
- Whoa.

779
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:17,710
Well, boys, let's go play some poker, huh?

780
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:19,770
- You still owe me from last time.

781
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:21,490
- Hey man, I'm good for it.

782
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:23,870
Hey Kenny, can you lend me 50 bucks?

783
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:26,474
- Jake, you owe me a hundred.

784
00:53:26,474 --> 00:53:28,160
- I'm good for it, man.

785
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,352
- Hey man, can you just
lend 100 bucks for tonight?

786
00:53:30,352 --> 00:53:31,373
(chuckles)

787
00:53:31,373 --> 00:53:32,206
- Nah.

788
00:53:34,343 --> 00:53:36,194
(phone rings)

789
00:53:36,194 --> 00:53:39,993
- [Irene] You've reached Irene
and Jacob, leave a message.

790
00:53:39,993 --> 00:53:42,743
- Ma, I'm sorry I killed her.

791
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:47,992
I promise it won't happen
again next month, okay?

792
00:53:47,992 --> 00:53:50,909
(foreboding music)

793
00:54:29,575 --> 00:54:32,242
(ominous music)

794
00:54:53,948 --> 00:54:56,281
Old bastard wasn't half bad.

795
00:55:05,327 --> 00:55:08,244
(melancholy music)

796
00:55:20,967 --> 00:55:23,217
(cat meows)

797
00:55:35,596 --> 00:55:36,429
Midnight?

798
00:55:38,242 --> 00:55:39,075
Midnight.

799
00:55:41,165 --> 00:55:42,248
Aw, Midnight.

800
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:47,738
(cat yowls)
It's okay.

801
00:55:47,738 --> 00:55:49,059
Gonna be okay.

802
00:55:49,059 --> 00:55:51,226
(shushes)

803
00:55:58,064 --> 00:56:00,314
(knocking)

804
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,740
- What took you so long?

805
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:08,890
- [Matthew] Huh?

806
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:10,740
- I've been knocking on the
door for like three minutes,

807
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:12,230
what's going on?

808
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:15,053
- See for yourself, but you're
not going to believe it.

809
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:17,283
He's back.

810
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:30,780
- Midnight?

811
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:32,030
How?

812
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:34,893
- I don't know, I heard him
at the door a few minutes ago.

813
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:39,450
- Yeah, but you lost him in
Big Bear four months ago.

814
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:42,550
- I know, I thought a
mountain lion grabbed him.

815
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:46,780
- There is no way Midnight
made it all the way back here

816
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:47,970
all by himself.

817
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:50,293
- But he did, he's right there.

818
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:53,990
- Are you sure it's Midnight?

819
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:54,823
- Yeah.

820
00:56:54,823 --> 00:56:56,410
He has the same collar.

821
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:57,273
It says Midnight.

822
00:56:58,159 --> 00:57:01,076
(foreboding music)

823
00:57:05,465 --> 00:57:06,298
- Hey buddy.

824
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:17,270
Crazy.

825
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:18,800
- Tell me about it.

826
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,910
It's weird because I was
camped out on the sofa

827
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:25,893
doing a sketch of him, and
then I heard him at the door.

828
00:57:31,418 --> 00:57:32,959
- Where did this come from?

829
00:57:32,959 --> 00:57:34,618
- It belonged to Mr. Torrecelli.

830
00:57:34,618 --> 00:57:37,520
The manager cleaned out his apartment.

831
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,110
That's real leather.

832
00:57:41,297 --> 00:57:43,563
- Damn, did you see this stuff?

833
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:46,663
That creep was creepier than I thought.

834
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:49,703
Oh.

835
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:54,683
By the way, found out
how Mr. Torrecelli died.

836
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,423
Neck was snapped like a toothpick.

837
00:58:01,118 --> 00:58:03,930
- So?
- So this sketch

838
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:05,950
looks just like Mr. Torrecelli.

839
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:09,340
And then you draw your cat
in the same sketchbook,

840
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:12,103
and voila, Midnight
appears at your front door.

841
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:15,303
Here.

842
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:17,243
Draw this.

843
00:58:20,869 --> 00:58:21,770
- What?

844
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:24,200
- Just draw it, a whole stack of them.

845
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,750
- Kenny, you can't be serious.

846
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:28,623
- Humor me, bro.

847
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:30,763
- Fine.

848
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:32,767
I'll humor you.

849
00:58:35,689 --> 00:58:38,189
(tense music)

850
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:43,573
Now what?

851
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:48,890
- We wait for the money to roll in.

852
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:50,323
(chuckles)
- Oh my god,

853
00:58:50,323 --> 00:58:53,083
you are the most
superstitious person I know.

854
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:57,420
There's nothing in that
one but old magazines.

855
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:59,920
- Yeah, well maybe there's
some Playboys in here.

856
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,280
- Playboys?

857
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,603
Did you just get defrosted with Dr. Evil?

858
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,673
- Some of us like big boobs, Matthew.

859
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:26,740
- What the hell?

860
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:28,190
- [Kenny] I thought you
said you checked the box.

861
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:29,510
- I thought I di.

862
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:31,010
- Well maybe you did.

863
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:32,220
- [Matthew] It's a coincidence.

864
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:36,890
- Look, what are the odds
that you in that sketchbook

865
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:39,960
draw your cat, and then your
cat mysteriously appears

866
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,520
after being missing for
four months in Big Bear?

867
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:46,940
And then I ask you to
draw a big stack of cash,

868
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:50,353
and hello, we get a big stack of cash.

869
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:53,023
You know what?

870
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:56,250
I blame myself.

871
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:59,650
I should've had you draw like
a big diamond or a pearl.

872
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:01,700
- [Matthew] Or a giant penis.

873
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,493
- No, I'm good there.

874
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:08,543
Well, what are you waiting for?

875
01:00:08,543 --> 01:00:12,263
A nice, big, fat, juicy diamond.

876
01:00:17,018 --> 01:00:19,630
- I have only one page left.

877
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:20,720
- So what?

878
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,480
Once we sell that diamond,
you'll be able to buy

879
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:25,127
a gazillion sketchbooks
just like that one.

880
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,210
Ha!

881
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:31,173
You said you thought it was a coincidence.

882
01:00:40,274 --> 01:00:42,413
So what are you gonna
do with that last page?

883
01:00:44,114 --> 01:00:48,885
- I don't know.

884
01:00:48,885 --> 01:00:50,303
- All right.

885
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:51,220
Later, bro.

886
01:00:54,977 --> 01:00:57,394
(door opens)

887
01:01:05,821 --> 01:01:09,988
("Moonlight Sonata" by Beethoven)

888
01:01:44,385 --> 01:01:45,218
- Hi.

889
01:01:46,364 --> 01:01:47,305
Can I see?

890
01:01:47,305 --> 01:01:48,222
- Um, sure.

891
01:02:27,003 --> 01:02:29,313
Can you keep still, please?

892
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:31,383
Thanks.

893
01:02:34,730 --> 01:02:38,063
- Matthew, let's get out of here tonight.

894
01:02:38,063 --> 01:02:39,090
Go to a club.

895
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:41,487
Monica found a great one in Hollywood.

896
01:02:42,503 --> 01:02:44,950
- You know I don't like clubs, Rosie.

897
01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:49,450
Besides, I'm in a groove right now.

898
01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:50,400
I don't want to stop.

899
01:02:51,512 --> 01:02:52,790
- Well I do.

900
01:02:52,790 --> 01:02:53,973
I need a break.

901
01:02:55,670 --> 01:02:57,190
I need some fun.

902
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,663
- [Matthew] Could you stop moving?

903
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:02,233
- I'm going out.

904
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:05,933
- Hey.

905
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:08,413
Hey.

906
01:03:10,301 --> 01:03:12,884
(solemn music)

907
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:16,633
Rosie.

908
01:03:18,553 --> 01:03:21,130
- I'll have Monica get
the rest of my stuff.

909
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:22,203
- Rosie.

910
01:03:22,203 --> 01:03:23,233
Please, wait.

911
01:03:26,134 --> 01:03:27,443
Who the hell is Shane?

912
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:33,825
Please, I'll do whatever you want.

913
01:03:33,825 --> 01:03:34,658
Just don't go.

914
01:03:37,014 --> 01:03:38,265
- Let go!

915
01:03:38,265 --> 01:03:40,765
(tense music)

916
01:03:42,582 --> 01:03:43,753
- Rosie!

917
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:45,083
Rosie, Rosie!

918
01:03:54,544 --> 01:03:57,044
(phone rings)

919
01:03:58,010 --> 01:03:59,643
Hey.
- It's me.

920
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:03,950
I got a better idea for the last sketch.

921
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:06,310
A mountain of gold!

922
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:07,303
- Too late, Kenny.

923
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:09,903
- [Kenny] What?

924
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:12,423
What did you draw?

925
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:16,083
- You know, even after six months,

926
01:04:16,938 --> 01:04:18,813
I can still draw her from memory.

927
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,178
(somber music)

928
01:04:20,178 --> 01:04:22,090
- [Kenny] Shit.

929
01:04:22,090 --> 01:04:23,460
Rosie?

930
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:24,640
You drew Rosie?

931
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:25,473
- [Matthew] Yeah.

932
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,060
- [Kenny] Why?

933
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:30,560
The woman stomped all
over your heart, man.

934
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:32,367
Rosie going off with that biker dude

935
01:04:32,367 --> 01:04:35,370
was the best thing that
ever happened to you.

936
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:36,513
- I loved her, Kenny.

937
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,903
I still think about her every night.

938
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:44,290
- [Kenny] Oh no.

939
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:45,123
Wait--

940
01:04:45,123 --> 01:04:47,400
- I mean, it's not as if I
expect her to show up my front--

941
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:50,977
(knocking)
(cat mews)

942
01:04:50,977 --> 01:04:52,278
(ominous music)

943
01:04:52,278 --> 01:04:54,911
Who the hell could be at my
door at one in the morning?

944
01:04:54,911 --> 01:04:56,836
(cat meows)

945
01:04:59,950 --> 01:05:02,040
- [Kenny] Don't open the
door, Matt, you hear me?

946
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,510
Don't open it!

947
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:04,343
- Why?

948
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,633
- [Kenny] Just don't, Matt.

949
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:11,046
I should've told you, but I didn't think

950
01:05:11,046 --> 01:05:13,690
it would do you any good.

951
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:15,553
- What are you talking about?

952
01:05:18,730 --> 01:05:20,610
- [Kenny] Rosie died, Matt.

953
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:22,570
She went off a cliff into the ocean

954
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:26,040
with that crazy biker
a couple of months ago!

955
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,653
They never found them.

956
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:30,766
- What?

957
01:05:30,766 --> 01:05:33,493
(knocking)

958
01:05:33,493 --> 01:05:35,940

959

Hang tight, I'm on my way.

964

- No!

965
01:07:00,530 --> 01:07:02,940
Why'd you have to draw Rosie, Matt?

966
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:03,853
Why?

967
01:07:04,904 --> 01:07:06,474

969
01:07:10,035 --> 01:07:11,285

970
01:07:13,115 --> 01:07:15,282

977
01:07:57,020 --> 01:07:58,338
Got the money?
- Yeah, yeah.

978
01:07:58,338 --> 01:08:00,588
How much do I owe you, man?

979
01:08:01,978 --> 01:08:02,811
- Twenty-five hundred.

980
01:08:04,583 --> 01:08:07,850
I ain't taking no fucking
checks from you, homie.

981
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:11,173

Twenty-Five hundred cash.

(ominous music)

1094
01:15:24,350 --> 01:15:25,183
- Ruby.

1095
01:15:26,571 --> 01:15:27,471
I need that money.

1096
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:29,713
Please.

1097
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:34,210
- Well life's a bitch, sugar.

1098
01:15:34,210 --> 01:15:35,670
Now get out.

1099
01:15:35,670 --> 01:15:36,503
Now!

1100
01:15:56,988 --> 01:16:01,020

(serene classical music)

1109
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:48,480
- Well give her a pull if you like.

1110
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:50,023
I must warn you, though.

1111
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:53,250
- Hey, you give loans on rings?

1112
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:54,503
- It depends on the ring.

1113
01:19:02,504 --> 01:19:05,254

1114
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:08,369

(foreboding music)

1116
01:19:14,090 --> 01:19:15,670
- My father.

1117
01:19:15,670 --> 01:19:18,020
He was the equipment manager
and everybody loved him,

1118
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:20,200
so they gave him a ring too.

1119
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:21,103
I want five thousand.

1120
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:23,650
- What happened to your father?

1121
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:31,428
(electricity crackles)
(ruby moans)

1122
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:34,150
- He died.
- Of what?

1123
01:19:34,150 --> 01:19:35,630
- Heart attack.

1124
01:19:35,630 --> 01:19:37,471
- [Demond] Do you wanna
sell it or pawn it?

1125
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:38,612
- I told you, man, I want a loan.

1126
01:19:38,612 --> 01:19:41,012
- (chuckles) Well people
in Hell want ice water.

1127
01:19:42,390 --> 01:19:45,230
- Look, man, you gonna
give me a loan or not?

1128
01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:47,460
- You're a gambling man, Jake.

1129
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:51,350
How about I offer you 100
thousand for one pull of the arm?

1130
01:19:51,350 --> 01:19:54,130
You get the gold token, you get the cash.

1131
01:19:54,130 --> 01:19:56,010
I'll even throw in the machine.

1132
01:19:56,010 --> 01:19:57,883
- What, a hundred thousand?

1133
01:20:00,330 --> 01:20:01,790
Okay, what if I lose?

1134
01:20:01,790 --> 01:20:03,618
- I get your soul.

1135
01:20:03,618 --> 01:20:05,440
(chuckles)

1136
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:07,210
- What is this, a joke, huh?

1137
01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:08,403
- No, I never joke.

1138
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:13,903
No, 100 thousand would solve
all your money problems, Jake.

1139
01:20:15,650 --> 01:20:17,640
- So are you like the devil?

1140
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:19,620
- I go by many names,

1141
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:21,290
many of which you could
not even pronounce.

1142
01:20:21,290 --> 01:20:22,190
Do we have a deal?

1143
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,170
- Let me see the hundred thousand.

1144
01:20:26,266 --> 01:20:29,930
(snaps)
(sinister voices whisper)

1145
01:20:29,930 --> 01:20:31,580
Wait, how'd you do that?

1146
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:34,310
- That's a hundred K,
Jake, all for the taking,

1147
01:20:34,310 --> 01:20:37,290
unless maybe you're not the
gambler I thought you were.

1148
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:39,120
Maybe the stakes are a little too high

1149
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:41,113
for a low-roller like you.

1150
01:20:42,130 --> 01:20:44,706
- No, wait, wait, just give me a second.

1151
01:20:44,706 --> 01:20:47,206
(tense music)

1152
01:20:49,810 --> 01:20:50,643
Okay.

1153
01:20:52,090 --> 01:20:54,260
I think today's my lucky day.

1154
01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:55,933
- Spoken like a true sportsman.

1155
01:20:59,414 --> 01:21:02,247

01:21:07,807 --> 01:21:11,055
You, you might want to
read the fine print.

1158
01:21:11,055 --> 01:21:12,467
- Nah, I trust you.

1159
01:21:17,605 --> 01:21:20,605
(suspenseful music)

1160
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:26,943
All right, here goes nothing.

1161
01:22:00,772 --> 01:22:03,772
(suspenseful music)

1162
01:22:07,495 --> 01:22:08,493
(gasps)

1163
01:22:08,493 --> 01:22:10,160
- [Demond] You lose.

1164
01:22:12,855 --> 01:22:15,438

1165
01:22:16,808 --> 01:22:18,891
