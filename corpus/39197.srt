1
00:01:37,314 --> 00:01:40,977
She was the firstEnglishwoman
l had evermet.

2
00:01:41,084 --> 00:01:44,952
And itseemed to me she knew
more about the world than anyone.

3
00:01:45,055 --> 00:01:48,889
But it was a world Siam
was afraid would consume them.

4
00:01:50,093 --> 00:01:54,325
The monsoon winds had whispered
her arrivallike a coming storm.

5
00:01:54,397 --> 00:01:59,767
Some welcomed the rain,
but others feareda raging flood.

6
00:02:00,403 --> 00:02:05,534
Still she came, unaware
of the suspicion thatprecededher.

7
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:11,013
But it wasn't untilyears later thatlbegan
to appreciate howbrave she was

8
00:02:11,114 --> 00:02:13,776
and howalone she musthave felt.

9
00:02:15,352 --> 00:02:16,819
An Englishwoman.

10
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,582
The firstl'd evermet.

11
00:02:35,305 --> 00:02:38,604
Mother! Come look!
l think they've killed someone!

12
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,767
Louis, do take care by the railing.

13
00:02:40,844 --> 00:02:44,541
Beebe, Moonshee, gather your things.
lt's time we went to shore.

14
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:48,050
l think we should wait
until someone from the palace arrives.

15
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:52,451
lf they were coming, they would be here
already. Besides, the ship is leaving.

16
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:54,615
My point exactly.

17
00:02:59,663 --> 00:03:01,756
Goodbye, Mrs Leonowens.

18
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:07,027
Louis!

19
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:12,474
Louis!

20
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:13,600
Pardon me.

21
00:03:14,578 --> 00:03:16,808
Louis, come along, darling.

22
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,575
- Mother?
- Yes?

23
00:03:18,648 --> 00:03:21,811
Why does this king need you
if nobody here speaks English?

24
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:26,015
The ways of England are the ways of
the world. lt's a wise man who knows that.

25
00:03:30,694 --> 00:03:34,858
Memsahib, in less than an hour
the Newcastle sails,

26
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,399
not to return for another month.

27
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,459
Tonight we shall all sleep
in our own home, l promise.

28
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,629
Madam. A carriage... where?

29
00:03:42,706 --> 00:03:44,799
A carriage? Wait, wait.

30
00:03:44,874 --> 00:03:48,275
What is it?

31
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,605
Over there. This way, darling.

32
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:19,336
What do you suppose he's like,
this King Mongkut?

33
00:04:19,442 --> 00:04:23,071
l heard that people used to be
forbidden to even look at his face

34
00:04:23,146 --> 00:04:25,444
and that they revere him as a god.

35
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,745
- You mean like Jesus?
- No, hardly!

36
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:31,844
l suppose if he wishes his son
to be tutored in the ways ofthe West,

37
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:34,151
then l should be quite honored.

38
00:04:34,257 --> 00:04:36,953
But why can't he just send him to London?

39
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,086
Then you wouldn't have
the chance to learn Siamese.

40
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:09,355
Gracious me!
Are we sure this is the right road?

41
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:13,352
How would we know?

42
00:05:13,463 --> 00:05:18,958
lf you are not the lead elephant,
the scenery never changes!

43
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,989
Mother, look at those statues!

44
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,575
Mem Leonowens, KawRub.

45
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,845
Mrs Leonowens,

46
00:06:42,952 --> 00:06:47,855
His Excellency, Chao Phya Kralahome,
the prime minister of Siam.

47
00:06:53,263 --> 00:06:55,959
Have you any friends in Bangkok, sir?

48
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,993
No. l know no one here.

49
00:07:04,307 --> 00:07:05,706
Sir is married?

50
00:07:07,043 --> 00:07:11,207
A widow. Can you please explain
to me why you call me sir?

51
00:07:12,115 --> 00:07:15,778
Women do not stand
in the presence of His Excellency.

52
00:07:21,324 --> 00:07:24,555
How long are you in possession
of dead husband?

53
00:07:26,996 --> 00:07:28,520
23 months.

54
00:07:29,632 --> 00:07:31,099
How did he die?

55
00:07:32,602 --> 00:07:37,505
Please convey to His Excellency that my
purpose here is as tutor to the king's son

56
00:07:37,607 --> 00:07:40,667
and it is not necessary
to ask personal questions.

57
00:07:41,277 --> 00:07:42,835
Please.

58
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:49,416
ln Siam, sir, it is custom

59
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:52,818
to first ask questions of personal nature

60
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,948
to be polite.

61
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:01,224
Mr Prime Minister, l meant no disrespect.

62
00:08:02,265 --> 00:08:05,530
However, getting here
was something of a challenge.

63
00:08:05,635 --> 00:08:08,263
Sir will be shown to palace quarters.

64
00:08:08,338 --> 00:08:10,363
Mem.

65
00:08:10,473 --> 00:08:13,772
l beg your pardon.
The king promised us a home

66
00:08:13,877 --> 00:08:15,936
outside the palace walls.

67
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,839
lt's what was agreed upon.

68
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:25,984
ln Siam, sir, you will learn
everything has its own time.

69
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:36,664
Don't bother unpacking, Moonshee.
lt's only for one night.

70
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:41,170
lt shall be settled to our satisfaction
or we'll be leaving as soon as possible.

71
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,932
We don't have any money.

72
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:46,464
That is correct, but l do not need
to be reminded ofthat.

73
00:08:51,481 --> 00:08:54,109
lt sounds like we're living in a beehive.

74
00:08:54,183 --> 00:08:56,276
ln the morning l shall go to the king.

75
00:08:56,352 --> 00:09:00,721
A monarch who fails to keep his word
is uncivilized, unenlightened and ungrateful.

76
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:06,126
There are principles at stake. Having a proper
British household with some privacy is one.

77
00:09:06,195 --> 00:09:08,789
l don't think Siam
agrees with you, memsahib.

78
00:09:08,898 --> 00:09:11,196
Mother, how can it be a proper household?

79
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:14,327
You haven't lived in England
since you were little

80
00:09:14,404 --> 00:09:16,497
and l've never been there at all.

81
00:09:16,573 --> 00:09:19,770
lndia is British.
That's what being colonized is about.

82
00:09:21,844 --> 00:09:24,506
Father would have put him right in his place.

83
00:09:24,581 --> 00:09:27,209
l'm very sorry l'm not
the man your father was.

84
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,384
l'm sorry, Louis.

85
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,789
But this is a good opportunity for us.

86
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:45,831
l should just... try to look at the positive side.

87
00:09:46,469 --> 00:09:48,562
Assuming there is one.

88
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,605
Your father would have.

89
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,971
He was a brave man, wasn't he?

90
00:09:55,144 --> 00:09:57,203
Yes, very.

91
00:09:57,947 --> 00:10:00,006
And most considerate.

92
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,881
Which is more than l can say for this king.

93
00:10:02,986 --> 00:10:05,147
Shall we go find your bed? Come on.

94
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:28,239
People of Bang Pli,
His Majesty's brother, Prince Chowfa,

95
00:10:28,978 --> 00:10:32,072
has heard your cries forjustice.

96
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:51,897
Cut them down!

97
00:10:57,006 --> 00:11:01,102
You. What happened here?

98
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:05,103
Burmese soldiers, Your Highness...

99
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:10,049
They said ifwe cut them down

100
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,515
they would return.

101
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,925
Unfortunate
your meeting so delayed, sir.

102
00:11:23,032 --> 00:11:26,331
King's obligation reach
into every corner of Siam.

103
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:29,667
lt has given me the time
to think of many things,

104
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,707
including why you pretended
not to speak English.

105
00:11:32,842 --> 00:11:35,310
l believe it wise to be cautious.

106
00:11:35,378 --> 00:11:39,041
l will assume that our speaking now
is a great step forward.

107
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,379
Best not to assume too much.

108
00:11:42,885 --> 00:11:45,115
When presented to His Majesty,

109
00:11:45,188 --> 00:11:50,125
you and son will remember
to touch forehead to floor.

110
00:11:51,094 --> 00:11:54,791
Although we have become
better acquainted with your customs,

111
00:11:54,897 --> 00:11:57,661
we have certainly not forgotten our own.

112
00:11:57,734 --> 00:11:59,861
Then how will you greet him?

113
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:01,995
With the utmost respect.

114
00:12:16,018 --> 00:12:19,078
Mother, are those men speaking French?

115
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:23,421
Yes. Apparently a warship's
run aground where it shouldn't have.

116
00:13:02,565 --> 00:13:07,161
lt appears sir must wait
to meet His Majesty another day.

117
00:13:08,604 --> 00:13:11,402
No, l do not think so. Come along.

118
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:14,400
Mem Leonowens!

119
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:16,739
Mem! Wait!

120
00:13:16,813 --> 00:13:18,940
Please!

121
00:13:19,348 --> 00:13:22,943
Your Majesty, l am Anna Leonowens.
l am the school...

122
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:25,146
Stop!

123
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,746
Who?! Who?!

124
00:13:27,824 --> 00:13:31,783
Your Majesty,
Mem Anna Leonowens and son Louis.

125
00:13:34,497 --> 00:13:38,490
Your Majesty, we have been
kept waiting for nearly three weeks.

126
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:42,037
l appreciate that you have
issues of great importance,

127
00:13:42,104 --> 00:13:44,368
but l imagine your son's education...

128
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,998
Silence!

129
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,008
Has she no understanding of protocol?

130
00:13:54,817 --> 00:13:57,786
She has been advised.

131
00:14:06,796 --> 00:14:09,458
You... are teacher?

132
00:14:09,532 --> 00:14:11,625
Yes, Your Majesty, l am.

133
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:32,885
You do not look sufficient of age
for scientific teaching.

134
00:14:33,022 --> 00:14:35,081
How many years have you?

135
00:14:37,526 --> 00:14:41,519
Enough to know that age and wisdom
do not necessarily go hand in hand.

136
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:46,364
l doubt you would say same
for being bold and English.

137
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:49,165
They are rather inseparable, l'm afraid.

138
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:55,567
His Majesty has not dismissed you.
Follow him.

139
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,074
Come along, Louis. Up, up. Quickly!

140
00:15:16,365 --> 00:15:20,131
You articulate logical answer
under pressure, Mem Leonowens.

141
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:22,500
That is very kind ofyou, Your Majesty.

142
00:15:22,605 --> 00:15:26,371
But irritating superior attitude
king find most unbeautiful.

143
00:15:26,475 --> 00:15:29,933
However, it will serve you well
given decision l now make.

144
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,547
First impressions can often be misleading.

145
00:15:32,615 --> 00:15:35,209
Along with my eldest son,

146
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,313
you shall now teach all my children.

147
00:15:39,388 --> 00:15:40,616
Come.

148
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,295
The royal family.

149
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,430
23 wives,

150
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,770
42 concubines,

151
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:02,242
58 offspring,

152
00:16:02,345 --> 00:16:04,745
and 10 more on the way.

153
00:16:04,814 --> 00:16:08,978
Each one unique.
Each one my hope for the future.

154
00:16:14,357 --> 00:16:16,416
l understand your surprise.

155
00:16:16,525 --> 00:16:22,760
Not as many as Emperor of China, but
he did not spend half of life in monastery.

156
00:16:22,832 --> 00:16:24,925
King making up for lost time.

157
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,628
Mother, what's a concubine?

158
00:16:37,346 --> 00:16:42,283
Attention, my most blessed
and royal family, we have company.

159
00:16:43,219 --> 00:16:47,485
Two who have sailed from far, far away.

160
00:16:49,558 --> 00:16:53,187
Presenting original pupil and heir apparent.

161
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,355
Prince Chulalongkorn.

162
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,457
This, my son, is your new teacher.

163
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:01,599
lt is a great honor, Your Highness.

164
00:17:02,371 --> 00:17:06,671
Have l done something to offend you?

165
00:17:08,644 --> 00:17:10,373
Of course not.

166
00:17:11,313 --> 00:17:17,912
Then why do you punish me
with lmperialist schoolteacher?

167
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,284
He doesn't look too happy about it.

168
00:17:26,062 --> 00:17:27,393
Dearest family,

169
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,731
l desire you all,

170
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:34,396
when of appropriate age,

171
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:38,595
to be educated in English language,

172
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:42,670
science, and literature.

173
00:17:43,412 --> 00:17:47,041
This is a necessary
and practical gift l give to you

174
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:54,555
and you must never forget to honor your
renowned teacher Mem Anna Leonowens.

175
00:17:56,892 --> 00:17:58,860
Hello, Your Highnesses.

176
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:02,956
l am pleased to meet you.

177
00:18:03,866 --> 00:18:07,825
This is my son, Louis.

178
00:18:08,571 --> 00:18:10,664
Must not forget head wife.

179
00:18:10,739 --> 00:18:12,832
The Lady Thiang.

180
00:18:13,876 --> 00:18:17,334
lt is my pleasure that you help
make her a fine scholar also.

181
00:18:17,446 --> 00:18:19,107
Lady Thiang.

182
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:21,148
Welcome, mem teacher.

183
00:18:22,251 --> 00:18:23,946
Prince

184
00:18:24,053 --> 00:18:25,145
Thongkon Yai.

185
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:28,381
Prince Suk Sawat.

186
00:18:32,128 --> 00:18:34,255
Princess Kannika Kaeo.

187
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,564
And Princess Fa-Ying.

188
00:18:42,671 --> 00:18:45,162
l'm not princess. l'm monkey.

189
00:18:45,307 --> 00:18:47,502
My deepest apologies.

190
00:18:52,314 --> 00:18:54,874
l study her in English myself.

191
00:18:56,318 --> 00:18:59,947
Well, Your Majesty,
l am most flattered by your welcome.

192
00:19:00,022 --> 00:19:03,822
And l find the opportunity
to be in a school an exciting one.

193
00:19:03,926 --> 00:19:07,020
Such devotion to progress
is to be commended.

194
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,898
Reform is vital for my country's survival.

195
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:17,962
As tiny feet change, so too will Siam.

196
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,567
But being in a country
with so many unique customs,

197
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:26,843
if l am to raise my son to be like his father,
which l very much hope he will be,

198
00:19:26,949 --> 00:19:30,407
then l must feel free
to follow our own traditions.

199
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:33,420
As a father, l understand.

200
00:19:33,522 --> 00:19:38,323
Good. Then His Majesty will appreciate why
having a home outside the palace walls

201
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:40,726
is of such great importance to us.

202
00:19:40,796 --> 00:19:45,529
A home which had been promised
but so far has not been provided.

203
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:51,168
lt is my pleasure that you live in the palace.

204
00:19:54,243 --> 00:19:56,734
But it is not mine, Your Majesty.

205
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:05,616
You do not set conditions
of your employment.

206
00:20:05,688 --> 00:20:08,213
And you shall obey!

207
00:20:09,692 --> 00:20:14,322
May l respectfully remind His Majesty
that l am not his servant but his guest!

208
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:19,693
A guest who is paid.

209
00:20:21,904 --> 00:20:23,997
Education begins tomorrow.

210
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:29,069
He sounds absolutely dreadful, ifyou ask me.

211
00:20:29,178 --> 00:20:31,237
He did unnerve me, l must say.

212
00:20:32,014 --> 00:20:35,814
Moonshee, why does
the king have so many wives?

213
00:20:35,884 --> 00:20:38,011
That is an excellent question

214
00:20:38,087 --> 00:20:40,078
for your mother.

215
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:43,582
Mother?

216
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,718
l heard you, Louis.

217
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:49,522
Well, Siam is a monarchy
just like England.

218
00:20:49,632 --> 00:20:53,068
And one way that a royal family
maintains its control

219
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:57,731
in the face ofwar and disease
is to have as many children as possible.

220
00:20:58,607 --> 00:21:01,804
So he needs a lot ofwives
to take care ofthem?

221
00:21:01,877 --> 00:21:04,402
A keen observation, darling.

222
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,812
Time for bed. Come and give us a kiss.

223
00:21:08,284 --> 00:21:10,377
Does he love all ofthem?

224
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,219
ln a way.

225
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:16,622
Like you loved Father?

226
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,151
Things are very different here, Louis.

227
00:21:20,262 --> 00:21:22,321
Even love.

228
00:21:22,464 --> 00:21:24,523
Go on. Offto bed.

229
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:31,570
Mother, why doesn't Queen Victoria
have a lot of husbands?

230
00:21:31,674 --> 00:21:35,041
Good night, Louis.

231
00:21:58,967 --> 00:22:01,936
l will never forget you... never.

232
00:22:03,939 --> 00:22:05,566
My heart is yours, Tuptim.

233
00:22:07,343 --> 00:22:08,901
l will always love you.

234
00:22:09,611 --> 00:22:11,579
...always, Tuptim.

235
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:15,141
Remember!

236
00:22:16,285 --> 00:22:17,912
l will never forget you.

237
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:32,926
Presenting royal school, sir.

238
00:22:47,182 --> 00:22:49,241
ls anything wrong, sir?

239
00:22:49,351 --> 00:22:51,911
No. Nothing at all, Lady Thiang.

240
00:22:51,987 --> 00:22:54,046
Louis, that will be your desk.

241
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,533
Yes. Well, l suppose class is now in session.

242
00:23:06,602 --> 00:23:08,229
Sit down.

243
00:23:13,675 --> 00:23:15,870
Greetings, Mem Leonowens.

244
00:23:18,046 --> 00:23:22,540
My father wish to give sir this
to put on path of good teaching.

245
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:26,247
Well, l shall certainly
bear that in mind, Your Highness.

246
00:23:26,355 --> 00:23:28,414
May l compliment you on your English?

247
00:23:34,863 --> 00:23:37,764
Siam - population six million,

248
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:41,860
spreading across 49 bountiful provinces,

249
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:44,768
from Burma in west to Cambodia in east,

250
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,604
presided over by King Maha Mongkut,

251
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:52,477
Lord of Life, whose strength
and power reach everywhere.

252
00:23:52,614 --> 00:23:54,980
Not in my house, they don't.

253
00:23:56,585 --> 00:23:59,452
Son ofteacher is forgetting l am son of king.

254
00:23:59,588 --> 00:24:01,613
Son ofteacher couldn't care less.

255
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,090
You will sit somewhere else!

256
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:05,490
l will not!

257
00:24:05,627 --> 00:24:07,993
Louis, remember what l told you.

258
00:24:08,063 --> 00:24:10,463
l'm sorry, Mother. But he started it.

259
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:15,866
ln my country, man never tell woman
he is sorry about anything... ever.

260
00:24:15,938 --> 00:24:18,099
lf you had father, you would know that.

261
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,607
You don't have a father! You have a map!

262
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:21,870
Louis!

263
00:24:21,944 --> 00:24:25,436
- lt's forbidden to touch royalty!
- l didn't! l shovedyou!

264
00:24:25,514 --> 00:24:28,074
Get one ofyour slaves to shove me back!

265
00:24:35,157 --> 00:24:36,886
Get off me!

266
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:38,449
Let me through. Excuse me.

267
00:24:38,527 --> 00:24:41,257
Stop it, Louis. That's enough!

268
00:24:44,466 --> 00:24:47,094
The nobleman, Thak Chaloemtiarana,

269
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:50,031
Siam's most prosperous tea merchant,

270
00:24:50,472 --> 00:24:54,101
pledges eternal loyalty and wishes to present

271
00:24:54,376 --> 00:24:57,937
his most beautiful daughter, Tuptim,

272
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:01,182
for His Majesty's royal favor.

273
00:25:15,497 --> 00:25:17,465
What has happened here?

274
00:25:35,684 --> 00:25:37,276
The British boy

275
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:40,788
pushed Chulalongkorn, Your Majesty.

276
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,293
Why?

277
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:00,940
Prince insult memory of boy's father.

278
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:32,730
998, 999,

279
00:26:33,742 --> 00:26:35,642
1,000.

280
00:26:35,777 --> 00:26:37,369
Finished.

281
00:26:37,446 --> 00:26:38,811
You may go home.

282
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,609
Aren't you coming?

283
00:26:40,749 --> 00:26:44,276
Not until Prince Chulalongkorn
finishes his task.

284
00:27:17,486 --> 00:27:20,580
l'm sorry, Lady Thiang,
but supper will have to wait.

285
00:27:20,656 --> 00:27:23,124
The prince has not yet been dismissed.

286
00:27:26,862 --> 00:27:29,854
His Majesty King Mongkut
afraid schoolteacher

287
00:27:29,931 --> 00:27:32,832
might get hungry during long night ahead.

288
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,631
He send food... for one.

289
00:27:46,281 --> 00:27:48,476
Why does my father humble me?

290
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,643
He wants what's best for you.

291
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:53,153
For the moment, that includes me.

292
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,314
Why?

293
00:27:57,159 --> 00:27:59,684
Most people do not see the world as it is.

294
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,888
They see it as they are.

295
00:28:01,963 --> 00:28:04,295
And a good king needs a broader view.

296
00:28:11,707 --> 00:28:13,766
Stay here, Your Highness.

297
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,078
What is that smell?!

298
00:29:13,368 --> 00:29:17,805
She has been chained outside for six weeks.
All because she tried to buy her freedom.

299
00:29:17,939 --> 00:29:22,603
Mem Leonowens, Jao Jom Manda Ung
is daughter of very influential family.

300
00:29:22,711 --> 00:29:27,410
Yes. And when La-Ore offered her the money,
she took it. Her mistress took it.

301
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,575
Then she accused her of ingratitude

302
00:29:29,651 --> 00:29:32,779
and chained her like an animal
where the prince and l found her.

303
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:37,120
Heir to throne must never be involved
in issue of bondservant.

304
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,251
lt will resolve itself in time.

305
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:40,589
Like my house?

306
00:29:40,662 --> 00:29:42,857
You are learning.

307
00:29:49,571 --> 00:29:53,530
Who would hang women and children?

308
00:29:54,075 --> 00:29:55,599
They were Burmese.

309
00:29:56,411 --> 00:29:58,038
So you've said.

310
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:02,180
But the puppet who leads Burma
has British strings.

311
00:30:02,584 --> 00:30:06,782
Why would the lmperialists
use such covert tactics?

312
00:30:08,757 --> 00:30:12,386
Because a war with one's neighbors

313
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:16,227
brings the British to the rescue.

314
00:30:19,201 --> 00:30:21,863
Men like you, Alak, were not built

315
00:30:22,204 --> 00:30:24,468
for so much peace and prosperity.

316
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:29,866
Peace makes men soft, Your Majesty.

317
00:30:30,712 --> 00:30:34,045
The English define Burma as

318
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:36,384
a ''British Protectorate''.

319
00:30:36,651 --> 00:30:38,516
Vietnam and Cambodia are known

320
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,913
throughout the world as

321
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,224
''French lndochina''.

322
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:50,262
What will they call Siam?

323
00:30:55,203 --> 00:30:58,070
l have been doing much thinking,
mem teacher,

324
00:30:58,139 --> 00:31:02,667
on why some in this life are masters,
like Jao Jom Manda Ung,

325
00:31:02,744 --> 00:31:04,837
and others slaves.

326
00:31:04,913 --> 00:31:08,644
That is something you need
to ask your father, Your Highness.

327
00:31:08,717 --> 00:31:10,810
But you are teacher.

328
00:31:10,886 --> 00:31:12,148
Teach.

329
00:31:25,734 --> 00:31:29,830
This American woman - Harriet Beecher
Stowe - asked the same question.

330
00:31:29,905 --> 00:31:33,773
Perhaps you should read her and then
we might continue our discussion.

331
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,274
A woman?

332
00:31:40,348 --> 00:31:42,077
Yes.

333
00:31:44,252 --> 00:31:46,311
Uncle Tom's Cabin.

334
00:31:47,856 --> 00:31:49,915
l shall read it at once, mem.

335
00:32:12,547 --> 00:32:15,516
You're trembling...

336
00:32:15,917 --> 00:32:18,715
Do not fear, blessed one.

337
00:32:19,421 --> 00:32:23,380
His Majesty is a kind and generous lover.

338
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,492
Come along, Louis!

339
00:33:41,803 --> 00:33:44,670
Quickly. We don't want to be late for school.

340
00:33:53,648 --> 00:33:57,982
Were you not commanded
to leave slave issue alone?

341
00:33:58,053 --> 00:34:02,285
Your Excellency, l'm fully prepared
to obey His Majesty's commands

342
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:04,858
within the obligation of my duties.

343
00:34:04,926 --> 00:34:07,827
Beyond that, l promise no obedience.

344
00:34:07,896 --> 00:34:10,330
You will follow.

345
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,703
She tricked me!

346
00:34:25,013 --> 00:34:26,810
She broke into my home,

347
00:34:27,082 --> 00:34:28,811
set my servant free,

348
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:31,450
then came to me with an offer

349
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:34,916
to buy her and made payment!

350
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:38,350
La-Ore purchased her freedom once,

351
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,554
and l believe, had l given
this woman my ring first,

352
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:45,531
she would have taken it
and continued to hold La-Ore captive.

353
00:34:45,633 --> 00:34:50,297
King's commitment to noble families
must not be compromised.

354
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,270
ln your letter confirming my employment,

355
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:58,870
you said you wanted Siam to take its place
among the nations ofthe modern world.

356
00:34:58,947 --> 00:35:01,711
You spoke of building
something greater than yourself.

357
00:35:01,783 --> 00:35:06,277
A country where no man is above the law.
Which is why l chose to come here.

358
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:14,520
Schoolteacher has outstanding memory.

359
00:35:15,463 --> 00:35:17,693
l want my slave returned

360
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:22,599
and punishment ofthis insolent English

361
00:35:24,405 --> 00:35:28,364
who dares stand before the Lord of Life!

362
00:35:30,011 --> 00:35:32,343
Kralahome...

363
00:35:32,413 --> 00:35:35,576
lf you would please honor
Jao Jom Manda Ung

364
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,883
with an explanation ofthe law.

365
00:35:39,787 --> 00:35:42,881
Regretfully, l must inform you

366
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:46,623
that bondservants have the right,

367
00:35:46,995 --> 00:35:50,954
by law, to buy their own freedom.

368
00:35:54,035 --> 00:35:56,697
And what if every slave in my service

369
00:35:57,038 --> 00:36:00,997
should bring me
the price oftheir freedom?

370
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:04,211
Am l bound to serve myself?

371
00:36:07,815 --> 00:36:10,443
That would be most unfortunate,

372
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:15,586
my august mistress.

373
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,568
This is a pauper's ring!

374
00:36:55,897 --> 00:36:57,990
Why did you intervene?

375
00:37:01,669 --> 00:37:03,967
My conscience demanded it.

376
00:37:04,572 --> 00:37:06,631
And boys' fisticuffs?

377
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:08,835
l beg your pardon?

378
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:13,176
l suppose, since you must be
both mother and father to son,

379
00:37:13,248 --> 00:37:16,240
tendency to overprotect is strong.

380
00:37:17,919 --> 00:37:20,649
Louis can fend for himself, Your Majesty.

381
00:37:20,722 --> 00:37:22,815
lt was your son l was protecting.

382
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:27,190
Thank you for the supper.
Although l do not think it was necessary.

383
00:37:27,262 --> 00:37:28,786
l know my son.

384
00:37:28,863 --> 00:37:31,093
You would still be there.

385
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,030
Perhaps.

386
00:37:33,101 --> 00:37:37,037
But then my point would have been made,
Your Majesty, not yours.

387
00:37:37,138 --> 00:37:39,197
- l am king.
- Yes.

388
00:37:39,274 --> 00:37:41,504
And l am his schoolteacher.

389
00:37:41,609 --> 00:37:44,009
Which lesson do you think he learnt?

390
00:37:44,078 --> 00:37:47,343
To respect his classmates
or to fear his father?

391
00:37:52,954 --> 00:37:56,651
Husband must have been
very understanding.

392
00:38:00,561 --> 00:38:04,725
My husband was never threatened
by my ideas or my opinions.

393
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,431
And because l am also such

394
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:14,099
l will allow you to always
stand upright in my presence,

395
00:38:14,175 --> 00:38:18,544
providing head shall
never be higher than mine.

396
00:38:20,682 --> 00:38:23,276
Thank you, Your Majesty.

397
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:33,184
Your Majesty,

398
00:38:33,294 --> 00:38:37,390
l believe there has been enough insult
caused by this woman,

399
00:38:37,532 --> 00:38:40,558
who believes herself
to be the equal of a man.

400
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:44,764
Not the equal of a man, Chao Phya.

401
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,667
The equal of a king.

402
00:39:04,726 --> 00:39:08,822
l make this for you tomorrow.

403
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:12,690
Why, thank you, Fa-Ying. lt's beautiful.

404
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,167
These are monkeys at summer palace.

405
00:39:15,236 --> 00:39:17,329
And this must be you.

406
00:39:17,405 --> 00:39:19,999
l shall hang it on my wall at home.

407
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:23,236
l will make another for you yesterday.

408
00:39:24,379 --> 00:39:26,574
Then l shall wait for it tomorrow.

409
00:39:30,985 --> 00:39:33,954
- Lady Thiang.
- Good morning, Mem Leonowens.

410
00:39:34,021 --> 00:39:38,219
This is Lady Tuptim.
She's new in palace, also like yourself.

411
00:39:41,429 --> 00:39:46,958
l wish also to learn writing of English to...

412
00:39:47,935 --> 00:39:51,268
to please His Majesty King Mongkut.

413
00:39:51,372 --> 00:39:53,237
Yes, well, certainly.

414
00:39:53,341 --> 00:39:56,868
But l should hope that
it would please Lady Tuptim as well.

415
00:40:03,351 --> 00:40:05,410
And this is for you.

416
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,848
Make sure all ofyour books are open.

417
00:40:39,053 --> 00:40:42,216
Who knows the next letter
in the alphabet after E?

418
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:44,383
- F.
- F.

419
00:40:47,728 --> 00:40:49,491
Who can tell me which words start with F?

420
00:41:31,706 --> 00:41:33,765
Fa-Ying loves the river.

421
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:37,504
Yes, she told me
all about herjourney to Ayudhya.

422
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,842
How it is the center ofthe universe.

423
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:44,112
lt is home to ancient ones
and their many legends.

424
00:41:44,185 --> 00:41:46,176
l told her in England we have Camelot.

425
00:41:46,287 --> 00:41:49,450
And a big round table.

426
00:41:49,524 --> 00:41:51,082
Yes, that's right.

427
00:41:51,158 --> 00:41:54,924
Everyone should have legends, l think.
lt allows us to dream.

428
00:41:54,996 --> 00:41:58,659
You're an interesting mix
of fact and fancy, mem.

429
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:02,532
l suppose it's because
l'm always surrounded by children.

430
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:05,902
Teaching the young
is fulfilling endeavorment.

431
00:42:06,574 --> 00:42:08,667
l didn't have a choice really.

432
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,608
Buddhists believe all life is suffering.

433
00:42:14,749 --> 00:42:19,209
Take away pain of husband's death...
takes away mem's chance to grow.

434
00:42:21,355 --> 00:42:24,688
- We might have preferred a different lesson.
- Yes.

435
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:29,752
But unique opportunity to change world
would have passed to someone else.

436
00:42:38,539 --> 00:42:41,337
Louis. Do try and stay in the boat, darling.

437
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:47,948
He asked about your flag and the significance
of the white elephant. l had no answer.

438
00:42:48,015 --> 00:42:50,313
Louis Leonowens!

439
00:42:57,592 --> 00:42:58,991
Yes, Your Majesty?

440
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,925
l am teacher now.

441
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:04,257
The flag of Siam.

442
00:43:04,365 --> 00:43:06,424
- Red is for?
- Courage.

443
00:43:06,534 --> 00:43:08,627
- White?
- Compassion.

444
00:43:08,736 --> 00:43:13,673
The white elephant is Siam's
most rare and honored creature.

445
00:43:13,808 --> 00:43:17,539
Perhaps on journey to rice festival
we will all see one.

446
00:43:17,612 --> 00:43:19,671
Rice festival?

447
00:43:19,814 --> 00:43:21,076
Mother!

448
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:22,410
Mother, look!

449
00:43:22,483 --> 00:43:24,576
There's Moonshee and Beebe!

450
00:43:26,954 --> 00:43:29,354
l trust you will find ample space

451
00:43:29,423 --> 00:43:32,586
for engaging in English traditions.

452
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:35,151
Even for growing of roses.

453
00:43:35,229 --> 00:43:38,824
Out of curiosity,
is this because of our agreement

454
00:43:38,899 --> 00:43:41,299
or are you simply trying to get rid of me?

455
00:43:43,638 --> 00:43:45,401
Yes.

456
00:43:56,984 --> 00:44:00,249
A little soap and water,
and we will have a fine house, mem.

457
00:44:02,857 --> 00:44:04,722
Shall l make us some tea?

458
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:07,487
Yes. That would be lovely.

459
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:50,169
l remember my first rice festival.

460
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:52,899
People come from everywhere to see king.

461
00:44:52,973 --> 00:44:56,966
He bless all crops, and it begin to rain.

462
00:44:57,078 --> 00:44:59,239
l think he was a god.

463
00:45:01,348 --> 00:45:03,441
And now?

464
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:07,386
He is also a man.

465
00:45:10,491 --> 00:45:13,756
l feel very fortunate that we're invited.

466
00:45:14,729 --> 00:45:18,165
One cannot see Siam's beauty
living in Bangkok, mem.

467
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:26,672
The mountains are so green and the skies
are more blue than even your eyes.

468
00:45:27,575 --> 00:45:29,202
l must find Louis.

469
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,369
Louis!

470
00:45:41,889 --> 00:45:45,586
- May l ask a favor, mem?
- Yes, certainly.

471
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,527
To send this.

472
00:45:50,564 --> 00:45:54,295
l wish family to know
how happy l am here with king.

473
00:45:55,402 --> 00:45:58,894
l'll tell Moonshee
to find a messenger straight away.

474
00:45:59,406 --> 00:46:00,430
Mem...

475
00:46:01,442 --> 00:46:03,535
May l ask a question?

476
00:46:03,611 --> 00:46:05,010
Yes.

477
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,239
How did husband die?

478
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:12,180
ln my arms, actually.

479
00:46:16,423 --> 00:46:19,187
How did mem survive?

480
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:23,588
Just as you will.

481
00:46:23,664 --> 00:46:25,757
One awful day at a time.

482
00:46:37,945 --> 00:46:40,880
Mem sha, Louis is teasing me.

483
00:46:40,981 --> 00:46:45,577
He say in England coldness
fall from sky like tiny feathers.

484
00:46:45,653 --> 00:46:47,746
Why would l lie about snow?

485
00:46:47,822 --> 00:46:51,383
Please, mem, it is too hot.
Can make some now?

486
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:56,157
Just because your father can make it rain
doesn't mean l can make it snow.

487
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:59,597
At last l discover her limitations.

488
00:46:59,667 --> 00:47:01,760
l have many, Your Majesty.

489
00:47:01,836 --> 00:47:04,361
Father, will you make it snow, please?

490
00:47:05,306 --> 00:47:07,399
Even for you, l cannot.

491
00:47:07,474 --> 00:47:10,500
But l've seen photographs
of such phenomenon.

492
00:47:10,611 --> 00:47:12,977
Blankets of it... up to here!

493
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,778
Louis... Smoke?

494
00:47:18,452 --> 00:47:20,010
Me? Jolly good!

495
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,281
No. No!

496
00:47:22,389 --> 00:47:24,584
But, Mother, he's the king.

497
00:47:24,658 --> 00:47:26,319
My father smoked too.

498
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:30,022
Yes, but your father had already
achieved his full height.

499
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:33,327
l have been smoking since age six.

500
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:36,870
And some believe me
to be a giant among men.

501
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:41,101
Yes. ln intelligence
as well as stature, Your Majesty.

502
00:47:41,208 --> 00:47:45,042
Which is why, Louis,
l'm sure His Majesty was only teasing.

503
00:47:45,913 --> 00:47:51,044
l believe now is good time for all children
to spread amazing concept of snow

504
00:47:51,151 --> 00:47:53,244
to cool off court. Yes?

505
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,413
Yes!

506
00:47:59,059 --> 00:48:01,619
l simply meant to open conversation

507
00:48:01,695 --> 00:48:04,061
in controversial fashion

508
00:48:04,164 --> 00:48:06,655
mem is so fond of.

509
00:48:08,535 --> 00:48:11,527
l do have my opinions,
but they're merely that.

510
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:17,305
l wish to compliment you for enlightening
children to open minds and taste life.

511
00:48:18,846 --> 00:48:19,870
However,

512
00:48:19,947 --> 00:48:23,542
at this time
l shall not offer cigar to your son

513
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:28,486
and you shall not teach this book to mine.

514
00:48:33,093 --> 00:48:39,259
Chulalongkorn has many questions, but one
cannot plow new fields in Siam overnight.

515
00:48:39,967 --> 00:48:42,060
l understand, Your Majesty.

516
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:07,979
Honestly, Louis.
l leave you alone for five minutes...

517
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,182
lt was his idea.

518
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:15,990
Just because Prince Chulalongkorn jumps off
a bridge doesn't mean you must as well.

519
00:50:16,063 --> 00:50:19,260
How can anyone smoke those things?

520
00:50:19,366 --> 00:50:21,891
Your father certainly enjoyed them.

521
00:50:26,507 --> 00:50:28,600
ls that why you like him?

522
00:50:28,675 --> 00:50:31,906
The king, l mean.
Because he reminds you of Father?

523
00:50:34,681 --> 00:50:38,082
l think that cigar
has clouded your brain, young man.

524
00:50:39,019 --> 00:50:40,646
Go on. Go to sleep.

525
00:50:52,499 --> 00:50:56,094
You drag me out at night
and turn down five pounds a bushel?!

526
00:50:56,203 --> 00:51:00,139
- French offer seven!
- What is the matter with you people?!

527
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:04,540
You seem to have a very high opinion
of the quality ofyour produce!

528
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:08,741
That is the best price you're gonna get!
l'm not gonna offer any more!

529
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,410
What are we waiting for?

530
00:51:14,121 --> 00:51:17,454
The Englishman must not be harmed.

531
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:23,483
No one knows where
these death squads will strike next.

532
00:52:23,824 --> 00:52:25,223
Then we must strike back

533
00:52:25,592 --> 00:52:27,958
and with twice the venom!

534
00:52:28,295 --> 00:52:30,286
Strike who, my brother?

535
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:33,590
The enemy still has no form.

536
00:52:34,168 --> 00:52:36,500
Loyalists to Your Majesty

537
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:39,398
are strung up to rot.

538
00:52:39,706 --> 00:52:41,571
Merchants who reject British traders

539
00:52:41,775 --> 00:52:44,039
are murdered in their homes.

540
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:48,313
England may hide
behind Burmese assassins

541
00:52:48,949 --> 00:52:51,645
but the stench is still British!

542
00:52:54,988 --> 00:52:58,253
One of us is wrong about the British.

543
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:03,118
l will assemble the Officers at once.

544
00:53:04,131 --> 00:53:05,598
No.

545
00:53:05,866 --> 00:53:07,527
lf you are right about the British,

546
00:53:07,734 --> 00:53:12,034
this war cannot be won on a battlefield.

547
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:13,729
Your Majesty,

548
00:53:14,007 --> 00:53:16,635
if we do not stop
these colonial predators,

549
00:53:16,877 --> 00:53:18,606
who will?

550
00:53:22,216 --> 00:53:26,619
Now, we all know that this egg
will never fit into this bottle.

551
00:53:27,754 --> 00:53:29,881
lt's a fact. lt's the truth.

552
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:33,153
And we rely on truth
to make judgments, don't we?

553
00:53:33,227 --> 00:53:38,665
What if ourjudgment is wrong, even when
we know for a fact that it must be right?

554
00:53:38,765 --> 00:53:42,394
Do we rely on our eyes
or do we believe in the impossible?

555
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:57,610
You see, one way to achieve
the impossible is to change the climate.

556
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:05,724
Leave us.

557
00:54:14,735 --> 00:54:18,728
The French say l am uncivilized ruler.

558
00:54:19,473 --> 00:54:22,909
l, who have spent entire life

559
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:27,037
attempting to teach self
history, literature, and science.

560
00:54:27,214 --> 00:54:30,047
Why would they print such things,
Your Majesty?

561
00:54:30,117 --> 00:54:34,053
You are English.
You should not be so surprised.

562
00:54:34,921 --> 00:54:37,014
Well, l can still be appalled.

563
00:54:37,090 --> 00:54:39,149
More importantly,

564
00:54:39,259 --> 00:54:44,162
do you, as a foreigner, see me in this light?

565
00:54:45,632 --> 00:54:48,658
l do not know all that you are, Your Majesty.

566
00:54:48,735 --> 00:54:51,295
But l believe l know what you're not.

567
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,464
And you are not what they say.

568
00:54:55,175 --> 00:54:58,576
Thank you, mem... for humble validation.

569
00:55:02,149 --> 00:55:05,482
l have decided to give self
anniversary dinner

570
00:55:05,585 --> 00:55:09,146
and invite important
English nobles and diplomats.

571
00:55:09,256 --> 00:55:11,383
l don't understand.

572
00:55:11,491 --> 00:55:15,086
French lndochina grows stronger
and more aggressive.

573
00:55:15,162 --> 00:55:20,759
But if l improve our foreign intercourse
with your queen's special envoy,

574
00:55:20,867 --> 00:55:25,133
French will think three times
before trying to undermine Siam.

575
00:55:26,807 --> 00:55:29,071
That's very clever, Your Majesty.

576
00:55:32,913 --> 00:55:36,178
As ifto sound English bugles
in own defense.

577
00:55:36,283 --> 00:55:39,343
You shall take charge of all formalities

578
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:43,219
as mem is obvious choice
to make certain guests feel at home.

579
00:55:43,323 --> 00:55:45,985
But... the anniversary is when?

580
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:48,118
Three weeks from yesterday.

581
00:55:48,195 --> 00:55:51,653
Three weeks?! That's impossible.

582
00:55:52,699 --> 00:55:54,997
Mem...

583
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:56,535
The egg

584
00:55:56,636 --> 00:55:59,127
is in the bottle.

585
00:56:41,782 --> 00:56:44,046
Only half a glass.

586
00:56:59,232 --> 00:57:03,635
We cannot have the servant bowing
every time somebody walks into the banquet.

587
00:57:03,770 --> 00:57:05,829
l understand.

588
00:57:34,301 --> 00:57:37,395
Just for one night.

589
00:57:37,471 --> 00:57:39,905
Thank you, Your Majesty.

590
00:57:54,154 --> 00:57:57,555
Sorry for nervousness.
This is first time in Siam history

591
00:57:57,657 --> 00:58:01,252
that king allow everyone
to stand up in his presence.

592
00:58:02,062 --> 00:58:04,292
But only for tonight.

593
00:58:04,865 --> 00:58:08,528
Your country and mine
have much in common, Your Majesty.

594
00:58:08,635 --> 00:58:11,468
Rich cultures. Long histories.

595
00:58:11,538 --> 00:58:13,802
And now, it seems, Mrs Leonowens.

596
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,306
Yes.

597
00:58:15,375 --> 00:58:20,278
My children's horizons keep
expanding under her tutelage.

598
00:58:22,516 --> 00:58:26,782
My husband and l have been
stationed all over the Orient.

599
00:58:26,887 --> 00:58:30,983
But l must say... l've never
seen anything quite like this.

600
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:33,150
Extraordinary, isn't it?

601
00:58:33,894 --> 00:58:37,728
Grand Palace born from
the mind of King Taksin.

602
00:58:37,864 --> 00:58:40,560
First man to unify all Siam.

603
00:58:40,667 --> 00:58:45,400
Our country owes its creation
to a man they declared insane.

604
00:58:45,505 --> 00:58:49,908
Well, these rooftops are a little nutty.

605
00:58:51,211 --> 00:58:53,702
He endeavored to build an empire,

606
00:58:53,813 --> 00:58:59,012
but the nobility that ran Siam
for generations had grown tired of his wars

607
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:04,318
and replaced him with Mongkut's
grandfather, someone they could influence.

608
00:59:04,391 --> 00:59:09,158
Taksin they put in a velvet sack,
beaten to death with a sandalwood club,

609
00:59:09,229 --> 00:59:11,493
and buried somewhere in palace.

610
00:59:11,565 --> 00:59:12,623
Oh, dear.

611
00:59:12,732 --> 00:59:15,963
lt sounds as though you admire him, general.

612
00:59:16,036 --> 00:59:21,099
l admire vision, Lady Bradley, in all its forms.

613
00:59:39,426 --> 00:59:44,454
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
l believe the sun set a little earlier today.

614
00:59:44,564 --> 00:59:46,259
Mem.

615
00:59:46,366 --> 00:59:50,234
You arrange all this
to influence positive future of Siam.

616
00:59:51,571 --> 00:59:55,063
And now you steal attention away from it.

617
00:59:57,477 --> 01:00:00,605
Well, that was not my intention,
Your Majesty.

618
01:00:01,281 --> 01:00:03,272
Mrs Leonowens.

619
01:00:03,383 --> 01:00:05,442
What a delightful surprise,

620
01:00:05,552 --> 01:00:10,182
encountering such an enchanting
countryman. And so far from home.

621
01:00:10,256 --> 01:00:13,157
Lord Bradley, this is indeed a great honor.

622
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:20,698
l'm half-crazy

623
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:24,395
All for the love ofyou

624
01:00:24,471 --> 01:00:28,202
lt won't be a stylish marriage

625
01:00:28,274 --> 01:00:32,108
l can't afford a carriage

626
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:35,511
But you'll look sweet upon the seat

627
01:00:35,615 --> 01:00:40,052
Of a bicycle made for two

628
01:00:48,261 --> 01:00:51,424
Gracious ladies, kind sirs,

629
01:00:51,498 --> 01:00:56,697
on behalf of 68 brothers and sisters,
we thank you immeasurably

630
01:00:56,803 --> 01:00:59,237
and bid you most gracious evening.

631
01:01:09,949 --> 01:01:14,352
Your son bears a striking resemblance
to his father, Mrs Leonowens.

632
01:01:14,454 --> 01:01:18,117
l had the good fortune
of serving with him a few years ago.

633
01:01:18,224 --> 01:01:20,283
He was a courageous soldier, ma'am.

634
01:01:22,128 --> 01:01:24,221
l thank you, Captain Blake.

635
01:01:24,297 --> 01:01:28,131
Father, may l please kiss good night?

636
01:01:35,542 --> 01:01:39,911
lf l may beg indulgence
for not wishing to break family tradition.

637
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:52,121
l will be there in your dreams

638
01:01:52,192 --> 01:01:54,285
as you will be in mine.

639
01:01:55,729 --> 01:01:57,788
- Good night.
- Good night.

640
01:02:04,738 --> 01:02:08,333
You have
a remarkable family, King Mongkut.

641
01:02:08,408 --> 01:02:11,275
A remarkably large one.

642
01:02:11,344 --> 01:02:13,403
Hardly seems fair.

643
01:02:13,513 --> 01:02:15,777
All these women for one man.

644
01:02:15,882 --> 01:02:18,817
Makes me wish l was Siamese myself.

645
01:02:21,788 --> 01:02:27,021
Mycroft Kincaid...
of East lndia Trading Company. Correct?

646
01:02:27,127 --> 01:02:29,721
Guilty as charged, Your Majesty.

647
01:02:29,796 --> 01:02:35,428
Mr Kincaid's company is merely one ofthe
ways we try to foster economic relations

648
01:02:35,535 --> 01:02:38,095
with other countries, Your Majesty.

649
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:43,165
Also, l think, to arrive at forefront
of world in wealth and power.

650
01:02:43,243 --> 01:02:44,267
Yes?

651
01:02:48,314 --> 01:02:52,842
Still, progress through commerce is logic.

652
01:02:52,952 --> 01:02:58,117
King find most practical
and excellent topic for discussion.

653
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:02,787
With all due respect, Your Majesty,
it is a little far-fetched to think

654
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:06,423
that commerce alone
will bring progress to your people.

655
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:10,401
Especially when they're awash
with superstition and fear.

656
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:14,065
Like your lovely concubines here
with their talismans,

657
01:03:14,174 --> 01:03:17,666
worn, no doubt, to protect them
from us foreign devils.

658
01:03:28,154 --> 01:03:32,250
A friend once said, Mr Kincaid,

659
01:03:32,358 --> 01:03:35,327
English also have fantastical beliefs.

660
01:03:36,696 --> 01:03:41,565
Or am l mistaking your country
for being land of Merlin and Camelot?

661
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:45,462
Point taken, Your Majesty.

662
01:03:45,572 --> 01:03:50,669
However, there is no arguing
the superiority ofthe English.

663
01:03:50,777 --> 01:03:55,077
And in the light ofthese dreadful massacres
up and down your border,

664
01:03:55,215 --> 01:03:58,776
it's no wonder you're seeking our favor.

665
01:03:58,852 --> 01:04:02,185
Superiority, Mr Kincaid? l do not recall

666
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:06,658
anyone being given the right to judge
whose culture or customs are superior.

667
01:04:06,726 --> 01:04:11,493
Especially when those judging have
frequently done so at the point of gun.

668
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:16,834
Would you not agree, Your Majesty?

669
01:04:19,239 --> 01:04:21,036
Quite.

670
01:04:22,876 --> 01:04:27,745
Well... the evenings here
are certainly warmer than in London.

671
01:04:27,847 --> 01:04:30,247
Hear, hear!

672
01:04:30,316 --> 01:04:33,479
A night made to order for anniversary party.

673
01:04:33,553 --> 01:04:39,048
Especially for a king who is
most charitable and forgiving.

674
01:04:41,895 --> 01:04:43,487
To our host!

675
01:04:43,563 --> 01:04:46,691
A true gentleman, generous in every way.

676
01:04:46,766 --> 01:04:51,669
May history mark this occasion
as the first step

677
01:04:51,738 --> 01:04:55,538
towards forging an alliance
between our two countries.

678
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:56,904
His Majesty!

679
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:59,069
His Majesty!

680
01:05:08,554 --> 01:05:12,456
And in honor
of our most distinguished guests

681
01:05:12,525 --> 01:05:17,360
a waltz, as is European custom
of dancing after dinner.

682
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:14,912
l must tell you, Your Majesty,
that l have not done this in some time

683
01:06:14,988 --> 01:06:18,151
and, seeing as the evening
has gone so well,

684
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:21,421
we wouldn't want to end up
in a heap now, would we?

685
01:06:21,527 --> 01:06:24,052
l am king. l shall lead.

686
01:06:27,533 --> 01:06:30,730
l never danced with
an Englishwoman before, mem.

687
01:06:30,803 --> 01:06:32,862
Nor l with a king.

688
01:06:33,539 --> 01:06:38,875
l want you to make promise, mem, to always
tell king what you think, no matter what.

689
01:06:38,978 --> 01:06:41,344
Like to man from East lndia Company.

690
01:06:43,483 --> 01:06:45,576
l always have.

691
01:07:42,891 --> 01:07:44,859
Mem.

692
01:07:44,926 --> 01:07:47,190
You're humming.

693
01:07:47,262 --> 01:07:49,822
Yes, l suppose l am.

694
01:07:49,898 --> 01:07:54,665
As alarming as this may sound, Beebe,
l'm feeling rather at home here now.

695
01:07:54,736 --> 01:08:00,003
What charming people, hm? You remember
when this marketplace used to terrify us?

696
01:08:00,075 --> 01:08:02,805
Like it was yesterday.

697
01:08:02,878 --> 01:08:05,847
l was afraid that dinner might unsettle you.

698
01:08:05,914 --> 01:08:08,644
All those Englishmen in uniform.

699
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:12,551
Yes. l thought it would
make me miserably homesick.

700
01:08:12,654 --> 01:08:16,715
Quite the opposite.
l rather enjoyed myself. Even the dancing.

701
01:08:16,825 --> 01:08:18,884
Shall we get some ofthese?

702
01:08:38,313 --> 01:08:42,340
And how did His Majesty fare
amongst all your countrymen?

703
01:08:42,484 --> 01:08:44,975
He was charming. Absolutely charming.

704
01:08:46,788 --> 01:08:52,158
l don't think l'll ever forget how he stood
there, holding his hand out as if l was...

705
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:54,319
One of his 26 wives?

706
01:08:55,163 --> 01:08:58,929
Well, thank you, Beebe.
l hadn't thought of it in that way.

707
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,093
Well, perhaps you should.

708
01:09:19,888 --> 01:09:22,755
We have been searching
for our Burmese killers

709
01:09:23,925 --> 01:09:26,359
here, here, and here,

710
01:09:26,995 --> 01:09:30,954
except no one
has seen them for weeks.

711
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:35,395
Which is all the more reason
to keep looking.

712
01:09:39,574 --> 01:09:42,839
Yes, but not up here.

713
01:09:44,246 --> 01:09:47,773
You once told me
Taksin marched on Burma

714
01:09:48,116 --> 01:09:50,641
through Three Pagodas Pass.

715
01:09:50,919 --> 01:09:54,855
Could they not invade the same way?

716
01:09:55,257 --> 01:09:59,591
To march an army through there
would take months.

717
01:09:59,794 --> 01:10:01,762
Yes, and how long have we

718
01:10:01,963 --> 01:10:03,931
been searching up North?

719
01:10:09,738 --> 01:10:12,605
Assemble a regiment at once.

720
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:20,980
l have a surprise for you.

721
01:10:26,888 --> 01:10:28,082
How...

722
01:10:28,189 --> 01:10:30,248
How did you...

723
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:32,952
l'm not quite sure, actually.

724
01:10:35,297 --> 01:10:36,764
Thank you, mem.

725
01:10:36,831 --> 01:10:40,164
My family... is very important to me.

726
01:10:41,202 --> 01:10:43,898
l shall leave you to enjoy every word then.

727
01:11:01,856 --> 01:11:03,255
Your Majesty?

728
01:11:04,659 --> 01:11:06,718
- You sent for me?
- Ah, yes.

729
01:11:06,828 --> 01:11:07,852
But here...

730
01:11:07,929 --> 01:11:10,022
Look.

731
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:15,995
Something tells me
my little monkey did not go to bed

732
01:11:16,071 --> 01:11:18,471
- night of anniversary.
- Yes, l know.

733
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:22,236
l've been presented with drawings
of couples dancing ever since.

734
01:11:27,015 --> 01:11:28,039
Come.

735
01:11:36,958 --> 01:11:39,051
Sit, please.

736
01:11:52,173 --> 01:11:56,075
Perhaps you should simply say
what it is you're trying so hard not to.

737
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:04,080
l share this with you, mem,

738
01:12:04,152 --> 01:12:06,950
because l believe you to be trustworthy.

739
01:12:09,357 --> 01:12:14,158
Events are happening which
l now believe to be of Burmese origin,

740
01:12:14,262 --> 01:12:18,198
and l fear that military action is unavoidable.

741
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:20,959
But Burma is British.

742
01:12:24,706 --> 01:12:25,934
Yes.

743
01:12:28,376 --> 01:12:31,971
Then it is not the French that
you were worried about, was it?

744
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:42,353
l see.

745
01:12:49,998 --> 01:12:56,699
On table, mem, is small gift of appreciation
for your many efforts at anniversary party.

746
01:13:16,858 --> 01:13:18,382
Mem's hand

747
01:13:19,594 --> 01:13:21,653
has been lonely without such.

748
01:13:24,065 --> 01:13:26,966
lt is... most kind, Your Majesty.

749
01:13:27,035 --> 01:13:29,128
lt's very beautiful.

750
01:13:29,204 --> 01:13:31,365
Though l am terribly grateful...

751
01:13:31,439 --> 01:13:33,771
lt is custom to bestow favors

752
01:13:33,842 --> 01:13:39,474
for those who... who please king.
And mem has done so.

753
01:13:41,683 --> 01:13:45,210
l'm sorry. l cannot accept such generosity.

754
01:14:06,074 --> 01:14:10,272
l hardly think ten days' rain
warrants the call to battle, Louis.

755
01:14:10,378 --> 01:14:12,676
May l suggest a retreat?

756
01:14:17,051 --> 01:14:21,044
Mother, l think l should have
a topknot like the other boys.

757
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:24,481
l think you've gone a bit daft, darling.

758
01:14:24,592 --> 01:14:27,026
With all this rain, it's no wonder.

759
01:14:27,095 --> 01:14:29,427
l don't see why l have to miss school.

760
01:14:29,497 --> 01:14:33,695
Because your classroom's under water,
and l cannot have you ill.

761
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:51,416
My mostprecious Tuptim.

762
01:14:51,486 --> 01:14:55,013
l knowyou will understand
why lmust write this to you.

763
01:14:55,089 --> 01:15:00,049
When you were torn from myheart,
l was left with nothing butmyfaith.

764
01:15:00,128 --> 01:15:05,623
Which is why, iflam to live,
l must devote mylife to Buddha.

765
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:08,225
For onlyhe can give me peace.

766
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:11,504
l willneverforgetyou.

767
01:16:10,365 --> 01:16:14,358
Fa-Ying was found
in the garden, riddled with fever.

768
01:16:14,435 --> 01:16:17,700
Difficult even fora grown man
to survive such.

769
01:16:17,772 --> 01:16:22,004
Cholera always in world
but still hardly at all in Bangkok.

770
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:26,206
- ls there nothing you can do?
- They have already begun. Listen.

771
01:16:26,314 --> 01:16:31,342
Phra Arahan. Reminding soul
to go to heaven and not lose way.

772
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:36,557
lt is why mem must not be heard weeping,

773
01:16:36,624 --> 01:16:41,357
as her soul will attach to sadness
and remain to comfort living.

774
01:16:45,166 --> 01:16:47,726
His Majesty is grateful.

775
01:16:48,803 --> 01:16:52,671
The little one has made
frequent mention of sir's name.

776
01:21:01,055 --> 01:21:03,023
lnside!

777
01:21:04,058 --> 01:21:06,686
l take all meals inside!

778
01:21:06,794 --> 01:21:08,853
Your Majesty?

779
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:13,629
Being as the rain has stopped, the children
hoped you mightjoin them for a picnic.

780
01:21:21,609 --> 01:21:23,634
Mem.

781
01:21:23,711 --> 01:21:27,203
l will always remember
your feelings for my daughter.

782
01:21:28,149 --> 01:21:32,108
And you shall never forget
you are not here to teach king.

783
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:35,018
The children miss you terribly, Your Majesty.

784
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:41,485
You cannot shut the world out for ever.

785
01:21:41,562 --> 01:21:44,030
Believe me, l've tried.

786
01:21:44,098 --> 01:21:47,864
When my Tom died, l thought
that my heart would never mend.

787
01:21:48,869 --> 01:21:51,030
But then there was Louis.

788
01:21:51,105 --> 01:21:53,471
He was my salvation, you see.

789
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:57,341
And yet you still refuse to live.

790
01:21:57,445 --> 01:21:59,913
l beg your pardon?

791
01:22:04,785 --> 01:22:06,685
A mother,

792
01:22:06,754 --> 01:22:08,551
a teacher,

793
01:22:08,656 --> 01:22:09,918
a widow.

794
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:12,323
But you're neverjust... woman.

795
01:22:12,893 --> 01:22:14,952
That is not fair.

796
01:22:15,062 --> 01:22:20,898
ln spite of all you say,
mem is not accepting passing of husband.

797
01:22:20,968 --> 01:22:23,061
lt is why you so protect son,

798
01:22:23,137 --> 01:22:26,573
and why you devote all time
to books and issues,

799
01:22:26,674 --> 01:22:29,199
and why you cannot accept gift!

800
01:22:29,343 --> 01:22:31,402
Why are you doing this?

801
01:22:32,980 --> 01:22:35,608
Because you lie even to yourself.

802
01:22:36,384 --> 01:22:38,875
So do not lecture me about living.

803
01:22:38,953 --> 01:22:42,081
You are not qualified.

804
01:24:32,066 --> 01:24:34,125
These hours are meant for sleep.

805
01:24:36,270 --> 01:24:38,329
You startled me.

806
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:41,299
l thought it wise to do so.

807
01:24:45,846 --> 01:24:49,942
May l ask what His Majesty is doing awake
at such an ungodly hour?

808
01:24:50,050 --> 01:24:52,245
Gazing at the moon.

809
01:24:53,287 --> 01:24:55,949
Yes, she's beautiful.

810
01:24:56,056 --> 01:25:00,049
As the sun rises, she will surrender the night.

811
01:25:01,028 --> 01:25:04,725
But she is always with him,
even when he cannot see her.

812
01:25:06,934 --> 01:25:09,767
That must be a great comfort to him.

813
01:25:12,339 --> 01:25:14,170
Yes.

814
01:25:18,946 --> 01:25:23,315
This come from Bangkok.
You may find it of some interest.

815
01:25:24,785 --> 01:25:26,878
- lt's from...
- Yes.

816
01:25:26,954 --> 01:25:28,649
Please to read.

817
01:25:29,590 --> 01:25:32,184
As monkey has stolen king's spectacles.

818
01:25:35,863 --> 01:25:41,199
''Your Majesty, the United States
sincerely appreciates your generous offer

819
01:25:41,302 --> 01:25:43,896
to help end this tragic conflict.''

820
01:25:43,971 --> 01:25:49,409
''Unfortunately our country does not reach
a latitude which favors the elephant.''

821
01:25:49,543 --> 01:25:53,946
''We are, however, highly grateful
for this indication offriendship.''

822
01:25:54,014 --> 01:25:56,949
''Your good friend, Abraham Lincoln.''

823
01:26:00,421 --> 01:26:04,221
l admire this man for what
he is trying to do for his people.

824
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:11,094
They say at the Battle ofAntietam,
70,000 men killed each other in one day.

825
01:26:11,165 --> 01:26:15,295
And each one ofthose soldiers
has a father who grieves.

826
01:26:15,369 --> 01:26:17,963
l'm father to all of Siam.

827
01:26:19,740 --> 01:26:22,300
Mem is not wrong about moving on.

828
01:26:23,811 --> 01:26:25,904
Neither were you, Your Majesty.

829
01:26:36,790 --> 01:26:41,056
When we return, it is time for teacher
to teach Chulalongkorn and others

830
01:26:41,161 --> 01:26:45,461
any subject she wish,
as long as king know first,

831
01:26:45,599 --> 01:26:48,227
so can be prepared for consequences.

832
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:51,429
l will do my best, Your Majesty.

833
01:26:54,475 --> 01:26:59,003
And l was always believing
Englishwomen slept in hats!

834
01:27:21,635 --> 01:27:24,229
l have been wondering, mem.

835
01:27:24,305 --> 01:27:27,468
When it's my son's time to become king,

836
01:27:27,575 --> 01:27:29,975
will he be a good one?

837
01:27:30,044 --> 01:27:32,877
Well, he is still a boy, Your Majesty.

838
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:37,781
But a keenly intelligent one,
with a warm heart and sympathetic soul.

839
01:27:37,851 --> 01:27:40,319
Qualities, l believe, of a great king.

840
01:27:44,024 --> 01:27:47,118
l want to thank you
for bringing me here - to Siam.

841
01:27:48,262 --> 01:27:51,129
l cannot imagine anywhere l would rather be.

842
01:27:54,268 --> 01:27:56,327
Were you happy in Bombay?

843
01:27:56,437 --> 01:27:58,496
l was never unhappy.

844
01:27:58,606 --> 01:28:02,303
But... l find myselftraveling
from place to place,

845
01:28:02,409 --> 01:28:05,435
wondering where it is that l belong exactly.

846
01:28:07,548 --> 01:28:09,675
And l find myself here.

847
01:28:10,217 --> 01:28:12,947
Your path is as it should be.

848
01:28:14,722 --> 01:28:17,520
My mind has taken me
down many roads of late.

849
01:28:18,926 --> 01:28:21,417
All ofwhich lead absolutely nowhere.

850
01:28:23,263 --> 01:28:25,322
What would Buddha say ofthat?

851
01:28:27,334 --> 01:28:29,962
That roads are forjourneys, mem.

852
01:28:32,506 --> 01:28:33,973
Not destinations.

853
01:28:40,180 --> 01:28:42,876
Don't your wives ever getjealous?

854
01:28:42,950 --> 01:28:46,044
l do not understand significance of question.

855
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:49,886
- Forgive me. l was prying.
- No. Please, continue.

856
01:28:50,758 --> 01:28:53,750
Well, most ofthe world believes that

857
01:28:53,861 --> 01:28:57,092
a man and a woman
should share a relationship

858
01:28:57,164 --> 01:28:59,792
which is sacred only unto themselves.

859
01:29:03,937 --> 01:29:06,906
Each one of my wives
believes same about king.

860
01:29:08,308 --> 01:29:11,004
Not everyone can marry you, Your Majesty.

861
01:29:11,111 --> 01:29:13,170
Good thing.

862
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,612
King need his rest sometime.

863
01:29:34,101 --> 01:29:37,366
Burmese camp, General,

864
01:29:37,638 --> 01:29:40,368
just over that ridge.

865
01:30:38,365 --> 01:30:40,629
Let us hope they are better cook

866
01:30:40,868 --> 01:30:43,166
than they are soldiers.

867
01:30:46,006 --> 01:30:48,600
We will camp here tonight.

868
01:31:13,133 --> 01:31:16,728
Your country owes you a debt of gratitude.

869
01:31:18,338 --> 01:31:21,637
Your instincts were excellent,
Your Highness.

870
01:31:22,442 --> 01:31:24,410
They ran offtoo quickly.

871
01:31:41,762 --> 01:31:45,721
To His Majesty and the greatness of Siam.

872
01:32:01,481 --> 01:32:05,440
You will not drink to your own brother?

873
01:32:10,524 --> 01:32:12,583
You said my instincts were good.

874
01:32:14,962 --> 01:32:17,055
And what are they telling you?

875
01:32:18,465 --> 01:32:20,763
That you are not drinking either.

876
01:33:17,958 --> 01:33:21,917
My soldiers needed palace uniforms.

877
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:25,462
You poisoned your own regiment!?

878
01:33:25,933 --> 01:33:32,236
Yes. ln war, innocent people die.

879
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:38,603
But only a war will cleanse this nation

880
01:33:39,613 --> 01:33:44,414
of its Western parasites.

881
01:33:48,455 --> 01:33:51,424
Take comfort, Chowfa,

882
01:33:51,992 --> 01:33:54,961
your brother and his children
will soon be joining you.

883
01:34:47,881 --> 01:34:51,442
All the bodies were stripped
and left to the sun.

884
01:34:52,152 --> 01:34:58,148
l fear Prince Chowfa and Alak
were cremated with the others.

885
01:34:59,626 --> 01:35:03,494
May their souls rest in peace.

886
01:35:05,665 --> 01:35:09,931
You couldn't have prevented
your brother's death, Your Majesty.

887
01:35:10,037 --> 01:35:12,130
Send my armies north.

888
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:17,142
lf Burma wants this war, they shall have it.

889
01:35:24,051 --> 01:35:25,313
Lord Bradley?

890
01:35:25,385 --> 01:35:29,446
Lady Bradley, Mr Kincaid.
lf l might have a moment ofyour time.

891
01:35:29,523 --> 01:35:31,684
l'm afraid a moment is all we have.

892
01:35:31,758 --> 01:35:34,727
We are leaving on the next boat,
and so should you.

893
01:35:35,495 --> 01:35:38,487
- My life is here, Lady Bradley.
- Nasty business.

894
01:35:38,565 --> 01:35:41,159
All this sabre-rattling.

895
01:35:41,268 --> 01:35:43,793
Not good for trade, l can tell you.

896
01:35:43,904 --> 01:35:47,670
The king's brother is most likely dead,
as is his general.

897
01:35:47,741 --> 01:35:50,539
l would hardly call his action unprovoked.

898
01:35:51,511 --> 01:35:53,809
What can l do for you, Mrs Leonowens?

899
01:35:55,682 --> 01:35:58,310
Are the British behind these attacks on Siam?

900
01:35:58,385 --> 01:36:01,548
Huh! Stick to teaching, Mrs Leonowens!

901
01:36:01,621 --> 01:36:04,681
lt's obvious you know nothing about politics.

902
01:36:04,758 --> 01:36:08,524
Burma would not make a move
without England's blessing. That l know.

903
01:36:08,595 --> 01:36:10,688
Precisely.

904
01:36:10,764 --> 01:36:16,964
But ifthis crisis isn't resolved soon and a
country under our protection is threatened,

905
01:36:17,037 --> 01:36:20,006
we will have no choice
but to defend our interests.

906
01:36:21,441 --> 01:36:23,102
Our protection?

907
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:25,303
Our interests?

908
01:36:25,378 --> 01:36:28,779
The ways of England
are the ways ofthe world, my dear.

909
01:36:28,849 --> 01:36:33,718
They are the ways of one world, Lady
Bradley. One l am ashamed to call my own.

910
01:36:33,787 --> 01:36:37,223
You forget yourself, madam.
Now ifyou'll excuse us.

911
01:36:37,324 --> 01:36:39,155
No, l will not.

912
01:36:39,259 --> 01:36:41,352
You raised your glass to him!

913
01:36:41,428 --> 01:36:43,589
You commended him for his vision.

914
01:36:43,663 --> 01:36:47,224
And all the while you were waiting
to take his country from him.

915
01:36:47,334 --> 01:36:51,668
How the empire conducts its business
is really none ofyour concern.

916
01:36:52,272 --> 01:36:56,766
The last time l inquired, Lord Bradley,
l was still a British subject.

917
01:36:56,843 --> 01:37:01,473
A fact you would do well to remember
next time you're cheek to cheek with the king.

918
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:24,098
Forgive me, but my Lady Tuptim
is in great danger.

919
01:37:24,771 --> 01:37:26,398
l am Phim.

920
01:37:27,174 --> 01:37:30,473
Someone found her in the monastery.

921
01:37:30,777 --> 01:37:34,770
She must speak with you.
Only Buddha can save her now.

922
01:37:46,393 --> 01:37:48,452
What is it?

923
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:02,433
Oh, my dear girl.

924
01:38:02,509 --> 01:38:03,999
What have you done?

925
01:38:06,046 --> 01:38:09,015
What l have done is not result of king

926
01:38:09,082 --> 01:38:11,141
or intention to dishonor.

927
01:38:12,152 --> 01:38:15,815
A concubine's heart
is of no consequence to king,

928
01:38:15,889 --> 01:38:19,154
consumed with matters
of the whole universe.

929
01:38:19,259 --> 01:38:22,558
But, Tuptim, why did you not come to me?

930
01:38:25,131 --> 01:38:27,531
The king might have understood.

931
01:38:27,634 --> 01:38:30,262
You simply can't do this to him - not now!

932
01:38:31,238 --> 01:38:37,473
lf love was a choice, who would
ever choose such exquisite pain?

933
01:38:38,878 --> 01:38:41,676
This is what l need His Majesty to know.

934
01:38:41,748 --> 01:38:44,546
lf such does not compromise you.

935
01:38:45,919 --> 01:38:48,581
l will tell him anything you wish.

936
01:38:52,192 --> 01:38:55,161
l thank Buddha for giving me direction.

937
01:38:56,096 --> 01:38:58,530
And now, with mem before me,

938
01:38:58,598 --> 01:39:02,466
l thank him for giving me true friend.

939
01:39:08,742 --> 01:39:10,004
Halt!

940
01:39:10,944 --> 01:39:11,911
Halt!

941
01:39:12,679 --> 01:39:14,613
Stay where you are!

942
01:39:38,705 --> 01:39:41,230
Lady Tuptim, you are accused

943
01:39:42,609 --> 01:39:44,201
of a traitorous act

944
01:39:44,778 --> 01:39:47,042
against His Majesty, King Mongkut,

945
01:39:47,747 --> 01:39:50,238
which carries the penalty

946
01:39:51,451 --> 01:39:53,009
of death.

947
01:39:54,788 --> 01:39:57,052
Please describe for the Court

948
01:39:57,657 --> 01:40:00,148
the events as they occurred.

949
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:06,227
Why say anything
if l am not to be treated fairly?

950
01:40:17,577 --> 01:40:20,410
ls this not the priest

951
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:23,274
whose letter was found

952
01:40:23,883 --> 01:40:26,181
in your chamber,

953
01:40:26,386 --> 01:40:28,616
written in English,

954
01:40:29,823 --> 01:40:32,485
in hope, no doubt,

955
01:40:33,226 --> 01:40:36,957
to disguise its lascivious intent?

956
01:40:38,298 --> 01:40:40,198
Fear not, Tuptim,

957
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:42,495
all life is suffering.

958
01:40:45,905 --> 01:40:47,873
Speak now, woman, or the cane shall be

959
01:40:48,108 --> 01:40:50,668
applied to you at once.

960
01:40:52,379 --> 01:40:53,676
My Lords,

961
01:40:54,814 --> 01:40:58,079
His Holiness, Balat, is the only man

962
01:40:58,451 --> 01:40:59,850
l have ever loved,

963
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:03,819
and being taken from him

964
01:41:04,524 --> 01:41:06,116
was to deny

965
01:41:06,593 --> 01:41:09,323
air to my lungs.

966
01:41:12,665 --> 01:41:16,795
His Majesty does not need me,

967
01:41:22,041 --> 01:41:27,069
but l need Balat.

968
01:41:29,482 --> 01:41:35,546
He wrote to me to bid me farewell,
believing l was lost for ever to the inside.

969
01:41:35,655 --> 01:41:38,249
So committed his life to monastery!

970
01:41:38,324 --> 01:41:40,815
You will speak in your native tongue!

971
01:41:42,495 --> 01:41:45,896
This priest disguised you

972
01:41:46,166 --> 01:41:48,134
as the most sacred of human beings.

973
01:41:48,334 --> 01:41:51,963
No, he did nothing!

974
01:41:55,508 --> 01:41:59,842
l disguised myself.

975
01:42:00,647 --> 01:42:04,583
When l knew he could not recognize me,

976
01:42:04,884 --> 01:42:09,253
l became one of his brothers.

977
01:42:10,123 --> 01:42:15,060
He never knew l was a woman.

978
01:42:22,602 --> 01:42:26,538
My Lords, l speak the truth!

979
01:42:27,907 --> 01:42:31,866
He gave you this robe

980
01:42:34,714 --> 01:42:37,911
and you went to his bed!

981
01:42:38,818 --> 01:42:41,116
That is not true!

982
01:42:41,988 --> 01:42:45,287
And l condemn you

983
01:42:46,025 --> 01:42:49,756
for your foul thoughts

984
01:42:50,163 --> 01:42:51,892
and cruel hearts!

985
01:42:53,700 --> 01:42:55,292
Cane her.

986
01:43:04,244 --> 01:43:06,644
Stop it! Do you hear me?!

987
01:43:06,746 --> 01:43:09,214
Don't you dare lay
another hand on that woman!

988
01:43:10,383 --> 01:43:13,978
She has done nothing but to try
and find happiness! Do not touch me!

989
01:43:14,053 --> 01:43:17,250
l will go to the king!
He will put an end to this savagery!

990
01:43:26,933 --> 01:43:29,197
Thank you for seeing me, Your Majesty.

991
01:43:29,269 --> 01:43:32,670
l was told by your prime minister
this was none of my concern.

992
01:43:32,772 --> 01:43:34,831
lt is none of mem's concern.

993
01:43:34,941 --> 01:43:38,342
And king is seeing you now
to tell you same himself.

994
01:43:38,411 --> 01:43:39,810
Forgive me, but...

995
01:43:39,879 --> 01:43:44,782
l do not wish for you to talk more
on this, mem. To king or anyone.

996
01:43:44,851 --> 01:43:47,445
- l was only trying...
- Tuptim broke law!

997
01:43:47,554 --> 01:43:50,785
By loving someone?
''Sacrifice your life for truth.''

998
01:43:50,857 --> 01:43:53,985
''Persecute no man.''
Are these not the teachings of Buddha?

999
01:43:54,060 --> 01:43:56,722
l am king! And l say enough!

1000
01:44:00,767 --> 01:44:04,066
You asked me to always tell you what l think.

1001
01:44:04,170 --> 01:44:07,799
What you think... and what you do

1002
01:44:07,874 --> 01:44:10,900
and how... and when you do them

1003
01:44:11,010 --> 01:44:13,069
are not the same thing.

1004
01:44:14,013 --> 01:44:17,005
lf you believe l wish to execute this girl...

1005
01:44:17,717 --> 01:44:21,278
But now, because you say to court

1006
01:44:22,388 --> 01:44:25,221
you can tell king what to do,

1007
01:44:25,291 --> 01:44:28,124
l cannot intervene as l had planned.

1008
01:44:28,227 --> 01:44:30,388
lntervene? After they're tortured?

1009
01:44:30,463 --> 01:44:31,930
Yes!

1010
01:44:33,299 --> 01:44:37,599
But you, a woman and a foreigner,

1011
01:44:38,938 --> 01:44:41,668
have made it seem king at your command.

1012
01:44:41,808 --> 01:44:43,901
You have made me appear weak.

1013
01:44:44,010 --> 01:44:47,810
And impossible for me
to step in and not lose face!

1014
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:50,246
- But you are the king.
- To remain such,

1015
01:44:50,316 --> 01:44:53,843
l cannot undermine ability
to command loyalty,

1016
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:57,686
- which l must have to keep country secure.
- You have the power...

1017
01:44:57,824 --> 01:45:01,419
Now is not the time to change
the way that things are done!

1018
01:45:02,061 --> 01:45:04,120
Well, if not now, then when?

1019
01:45:04,230 --> 01:45:07,961
How many more people must die
so that you might save face?!

1020
01:45:17,844 --> 01:45:20,278
Go home, mem.

1021
01:45:20,346 --> 01:45:22,439
You help enough for one day.

1022
01:49:47,313 --> 01:49:51,807
For the life of me, l don't know
how you people can stand this heat.

1023
01:49:51,918 --> 01:49:54,751
You have five minutes, Mr Kincaid.

1024
01:49:54,820 --> 01:49:57,015
l suggest you not waste them.

1025
01:49:58,758 --> 01:50:01,625
l don't suppose l could have a glass ofwater?

1026
01:50:05,731 --> 01:50:07,358
Right.

1027
01:50:07,433 --> 01:50:09,833
Then l'll come straight to the point.

1028
01:50:11,237 --> 01:50:17,233
As you know, l do a lot
of business with the Siamese,

1029
01:50:17,343 --> 01:50:20,574
many ofwhom have ended up
dead in recent months.

1030
01:50:20,646 --> 01:50:25,549
Which, as l have discovered,
is all part of some elaborate plot

1031
01:50:25,618 --> 01:50:28,746
to make you think we British are the villains.

1032
01:50:31,457 --> 01:50:34,426
l happen to know we are not.

1033
01:50:34,994 --> 01:50:41,558
The acquisition of a particular little piece
of information has cost me a small fortune.

1034
01:50:41,634 --> 01:50:44,501
But the fact is, when all is said and done,

1035
01:50:44,603 --> 01:50:48,004
l make more money
with Mongkut on the throne, so

1036
01:50:48,074 --> 01:50:53,307
l think l'm about to become your best friend.

1037
01:50:55,281 --> 01:51:02,016
Your Majesty, Alak will not stop
until all ofyour children are in velvet sacks.

1038
01:51:03,322 --> 01:51:07,383
Kincaid said he'll blame
the coup on Burma,

1039
01:51:07,460 --> 01:51:12,989
then launch a full-scale attack using
your troops already protecting the border.

1040
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:17,397
Alak seeks to finish
what Taksin only dreamed of.

1041
01:51:17,470 --> 01:51:19,529
Taksin was insane.

1042
01:51:19,638 --> 01:51:21,435
No.

1043
01:51:21,507 --> 01:51:23,600
He was betrayed.

1044
01:51:24,610 --> 01:51:26,669
As we are now.

1045
01:51:27,646 --> 01:51:30,114
How long before Alak reaches the city?

1046
01:51:30,249 --> 01:51:31,944
A week.

1047
01:51:32,051 --> 01:51:33,746
Maybe less.

1048
01:51:33,853 --> 01:51:35,912
And my armies?

1049
01:51:36,022 --> 01:51:38,650
They will never reach the palace in time.

1050
01:51:41,694 --> 01:51:43,753
Then he has already won.

1051
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:48,292
l will evacuate the royal family at once.

1052
01:52:04,650 --> 01:52:06,117
No.

1053
01:52:06,252 --> 01:52:08,311
Recall the army.

1054
01:52:08,387 --> 01:52:10,480
And announce to the people

1055
01:52:11,490 --> 01:52:14,755
we have just received glad tidings.

1056
01:52:18,898 --> 01:52:20,957
Glad tidings, Your Majesty?

1057
01:52:32,178 --> 01:52:35,773
Mother, doesn't chahng see kao
mean white elephant?

1058
01:52:35,881 --> 01:52:39,476
- Do you think they've found one?
- Yes. ln Prachin Buri.

1059
01:52:39,552 --> 01:52:42,783
Entire village has seen it.
The first in 20 years!

1060
01:52:42,888 --> 01:52:46,324
- l'll see to our tickets.
- l don't want to go, Mother.

1061
01:52:46,392 --> 01:52:48,690
l don't want to leave my friends.

1062
01:52:48,761 --> 01:52:52,720
- The king has done good things too.
- Your mother has much on her mind.

1063
01:52:52,798 --> 01:52:55,289
You said the Siamese people are just like us.

1064
01:52:55,367 --> 01:52:58,632
And what about Chulalongkorn?
Doesn't he matter any more?

1065
01:53:01,574 --> 01:53:05,908
Believe me, darling.
l wish this could all be very different.

1066
01:53:05,978 --> 01:53:08,037
lt is the right decision.

1067
01:53:08,147 --> 01:53:09,944
We must go.

1068
01:53:27,399 --> 01:53:29,060
Sir.

1069
01:53:29,168 --> 01:53:35,596
You of all are most aware
there are certain boundaries l cannot cross.

1070
01:53:35,674 --> 01:53:38,165
One being to contradict king.

1071
01:53:38,244 --> 01:53:40,371
Yes. And God help him.

1072
01:53:40,446 --> 01:53:41,743
Excuse me.

1073
01:53:41,814 --> 01:53:44,783
Passage for four on the Newcastle.
Thank you.

1074
01:53:44,850 --> 01:53:46,943
There is no white elephant, sir.

1075
01:53:50,189 --> 01:53:53,090
King invented sighting at Prachin Buri

1076
01:53:53,192 --> 01:53:58,027
so he can escort royal family
to greet imaginary beast, as in tradition.

1077
01:53:58,097 --> 01:54:00,190
l don't understand.

1078
01:54:04,503 --> 01:54:08,735
There is a traitor marching on palace.

1079
01:54:09,775 --> 01:54:15,111
Deception's only purpose is to hide children
in monastery in village of Nong Khai.

1080
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:18,507
Please, mem.

1081
01:54:18,617 --> 01:54:21,882
My king believes you are wise.

1082
01:54:21,987 --> 01:54:25,923
You are only one who can persuade him
to stay with children

1083
01:54:26,025 --> 01:54:29,927
until army returns to Bangkok
and palace is secure.

1084
01:54:32,631 --> 01:54:34,690
Please, mem.

1085
01:54:44,710 --> 01:54:46,302
Everything in order, gentlemen?

1086
01:54:46,378 --> 01:54:49,643
We have fireworks to announce the
sighting and musicians for the journey.

1087
01:54:49,715 --> 01:54:51,842
Let us hope Alak is convinced.

1088
01:55:54,546 --> 01:55:59,108
l have just been informed ofthe nature
of your expedition, Your Majesty.

1089
01:55:59,184 --> 01:56:04,144
And l would like to ask a few questions
about the dangers involved

1090
01:56:04,223 --> 01:56:06,885
as l've heard, at times,

1091
01:56:06,959 --> 01:56:09,826
wild elephants cannot be reasoned with.

1092
01:56:12,164 --> 01:56:16,294
l am surprised Kralahome
took time to arouse such curiosity

1093
01:56:16,368 --> 01:56:19,337
rather than make sure
mem not miss her boat.

1094
01:56:21,740 --> 01:56:25,972
We have already missed our boat
so that l might speak with you now.

1095
01:56:26,045 --> 01:56:28,377
King cannot miss his boat.

1096
01:56:28,514 --> 01:56:32,348
lf it will not be inconvenient,
we should like to go with you.

1097
01:56:32,418 --> 01:56:35,512
Jungle is no place for proper English teacher.

1098
01:56:35,587 --> 01:56:40,183
No, it is not, Your Majesty. Which is why
the presence of one in your cortege

1099
01:56:40,259 --> 01:56:42,420
might help ensure your display.

1100
01:56:47,199 --> 01:56:49,429
Something l feel,

1101
01:56:49,568 --> 01:56:51,934
for many reasons,

1102
01:56:52,004 --> 01:56:54,564
l would very much like to do.

1103
01:57:57,469 --> 01:58:00,836
When a woman who has much to say
says nothing,

1104
01:58:02,207 --> 01:58:04,471
her silence can be deafening.

1105
01:58:10,716 --> 01:58:13,412
l wish to thank you, mem, for your courage.

1106
01:58:18,357 --> 01:58:21,019
l thought l never wanted to see you again.

1107
01:58:35,908 --> 01:58:39,901
l had a vision ofyoung Tuptim and of Balat.

1108
01:58:41,513 --> 01:58:44,880
l think by touching us all

1109
01:58:44,950 --> 01:58:49,478
they have fulfilled their destiny
and attained eternal peace.

1110
01:58:53,125 --> 01:58:57,892
Through birth and rebirth, we Buddhists
hope to learn from our mistakes.

1111
01:59:02,968 --> 01:59:07,268
You told me once that l had never
accepted the loss of my husband.

1112
01:59:07,339 --> 01:59:11,105
- l had no right.
- No, no. That was true.

1113
01:59:11,810 --> 01:59:15,075
l now realize that
it is not enough to just survive.

1114
01:59:16,482 --> 01:59:18,973
That life is... precious.

1115
01:59:21,186 --> 01:59:25,145
Especially ifyou're Christian
and only allowed to have one.

1116
01:59:29,761 --> 01:59:31,820
Why did you come back?

1117
01:59:36,201 --> 01:59:39,227
Because l could not imagine
a Siam without you.

1118
01:59:59,858 --> 02:00:03,157
The Royal Steamer
has been abandoned near Lopburi.

1119
02:00:03,795 --> 02:00:07,060
The King travels East on foot,
away from Prachin Buri.

1120
02:00:10,135 --> 02:00:12,763
lf he lies about a white elephant,

1121
02:00:13,205 --> 02:00:16,834
what other scheme has he concealed?

1122
02:00:18,143 --> 02:00:21,772
Are the children with him?

1123
02:00:22,648 --> 02:00:23,615
Yes.

1124
02:00:24,983 --> 02:00:27,577
Where would he take them?

1125
02:00:34,026 --> 02:00:36,620
There is a monastery in Nong Khai...

1126
02:00:38,964 --> 02:00:44,459
Mongkut spent half his life there.

1127
02:00:45,837 --> 02:00:48,101
His sanctuary.

1128
02:00:50,842 --> 02:00:55,438
The Chakri Dynasty comes to us.

1129
02:00:56,048 --> 02:01:00,007
We must not keep them waiting.

1130
02:02:07,686 --> 02:02:12,487
We cannot outrun them, Your Majesty.

1131
02:02:28,774 --> 02:02:33,006
Do not let them see your fear, gentlemen.

1132
02:02:38,183 --> 02:02:40,276
What has happened?

1133
02:02:40,352 --> 02:02:43,378
You and the children must
go on to Nong Khai without me.

1134
02:02:43,488 --> 02:02:45,547
l will meet you there.

1135
02:02:45,624 --> 02:02:49,025
l can see it in your eyes.
Something awful has happened.

1136
02:02:49,127 --> 02:02:51,186
Was not to be this way, mem.

1137
02:02:53,432 --> 02:02:55,525
Alak's army has found us.

1138
02:02:55,600 --> 02:02:57,693
lf he crosses the bridge,

1139
02:02:58,937 --> 02:03:01,235
everything l love will die.

1140
02:03:01,339 --> 02:03:03,933
- But they're only children.
- Yes.

1141
02:03:04,643 --> 02:03:06,736
And each one heir to throne.

1142
02:03:07,612 --> 02:03:09,773
Now... you must hurry.

1143
02:03:11,183 --> 02:03:14,550
- What will you do?
- Blow up the bridge.

1144
02:03:14,619 --> 02:03:16,712
But will that stop him?

1145
02:03:16,788 --> 02:03:18,847
lt will - if he's on it.

1146
02:03:18,990 --> 02:03:23,188
Your Majesty, promise me...
Promise me that l will see you again.

1147
02:03:31,670 --> 02:03:36,004
lf your Bible is correct,
whole world created in seven days.

1148
02:03:36,475 --> 02:03:38,739
Therefore

1149
02:03:38,810 --> 02:03:41,608
possible handful of men can stop an army.

1150
02:03:56,661 --> 02:04:01,098
But, Father, never has such
an expedition excluded royal children.

1151
02:04:02,200 --> 02:04:07,263
My son, there are many things you will
come to understand when you are older.

1152
02:04:07,372 --> 02:04:09,101
Why can't l stay with you?

1153
02:04:09,207 --> 02:04:12,438
Because l need you
to lead our family to the monastery!

1154
02:04:17,582 --> 02:04:20,847
There is no white elephant, is there?

1155
02:04:55,153 --> 02:04:57,713
Come. Come.

1156
02:05:59,317 --> 02:06:00,978
No matter what happens...

1157
02:06:01,353 --> 02:06:02,513
the moment you're ready

1158
02:06:02,988 --> 02:06:04,717
blow this bridge.

1159
02:07:26,705 --> 02:07:28,673
Throw down your weapons

1160
02:07:28,907 --> 02:07:32,468
or you and your men will be slaughtered

1161
02:07:32,777 --> 02:07:34,472
without mercy.

1162
02:07:36,848 --> 02:07:39,646
l hardly think women and children

1163
02:07:39,884 --> 02:07:43,911
with parasols are up to the task.

1164
02:07:44,723 --> 02:07:49,683
l think you will find l have more on
my side than just women and children.

1165
02:08:06,344 --> 02:08:08,312
lt's a trap, General.

1166
02:08:38,443 --> 02:08:41,674
Mother, come look!
The king is waiting on the bridge.

1167
02:08:41,746 --> 02:08:44,943
- What?
- There's hundreds of men on the other side.

1168
02:08:57,262 --> 02:08:59,355
Wait! Stop the carriage.

1169
02:09:00,999 --> 02:09:03,331
He's crazy.

1170
02:09:05,970 --> 02:09:07,597
He's bluffing.

1171
02:09:44,442 --> 02:09:47,411
...Defiant to the last.

1172
02:09:47,846 --> 02:09:50,576
As the sun sets,

1173
02:09:50,949 --> 02:09:54,578
so does the Chakri Dynasty.

1174
02:10:11,603 --> 02:10:13,070
He's brought the British!?

1175
02:10:13,471 --> 02:10:15,132
There is nobody! lt's a trick!

1176
02:10:15,740 --> 02:10:17,173
lt's the British!

1177
02:10:17,442 --> 02:10:19,205
Retreat!

1178
02:10:19,944 --> 02:10:21,206
There is no one!

1179
02:10:21,479 --> 02:10:22,468
lt's a trick!

1180
02:10:39,297 --> 02:10:42,960
There is nobody! lt's a trick!

1181
02:10:45,603 --> 02:10:47,571
lt's a trick.

1182
02:11:00,018 --> 02:11:02,816
Let me kill him.

1183
02:11:03,087 --> 02:11:04,054
No.

1184
02:11:06,524 --> 02:11:11,484
l want him to live with his humiliation.

1185
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:57,695
You!

1186
02:12:58,636 --> 02:13:02,299
Why did you not go to monastery
like king order?

1187
02:13:04,108 --> 02:13:07,339
Because l lost one man to the jungle,
Your Majesty.

1188
02:13:07,412 --> 02:13:10,381
l was not about to let that happen again.

1189
02:13:10,481 --> 02:13:13,109
Mem Anna not fully to blame, Father.

1190
02:13:13,184 --> 02:13:16,881
After all, you did put me in charge.

1191
02:13:24,962 --> 02:13:29,194
To sound English bugles in own defense.

1192
02:13:30,234 --> 02:13:32,327
Yes.

1193
02:13:35,340 --> 02:13:38,798
When king say handful of men
could save all Siam,

1194
02:13:38,876 --> 02:13:41,936
he was most unusually

1195
02:13:42,980 --> 02:13:45,039
incorrect.

1196
02:13:51,422 --> 02:13:55,051
And it be then that all ears hear

1197
02:13:56,394 --> 02:13:58,954
what all eyes suddenly see.

1198
02:13:59,030 --> 02:14:01,590
Great white beast in infinite splendor!

1199
02:14:02,300 --> 02:14:04,393
Where's the beast?

1200
02:14:06,704 --> 02:14:09,366
Great white beast!

1201
02:14:15,580 --> 02:14:18,708
And as people rejoice
with overwhelming joy,

1202
02:14:30,461 --> 02:14:36,832
most excellent conclusion to expedition
echoed in every corner of Siam.

1203
02:14:36,901 --> 02:14:38,528
The end!

1204
02:14:50,314 --> 02:14:52,407
Perfect! You were wonderful!

1205
02:14:52,483 --> 02:14:54,417
Very, very good.

1206
02:14:54,485 --> 02:14:59,286
Mem, this is play to commemorate
monumental occasion

1207
02:14:59,357 --> 02:15:03,760
and we make fools of selves
because of insufficient practice.

1208
02:15:03,861 --> 02:15:08,127
l understand truly, Your Highness.
But the celebration was tonight!

1209
02:15:08,232 --> 02:15:10,291
We were duty-bound, were we not?

1210
02:15:10,368 --> 02:15:12,893
- Were we not?
- Yes!

1211
02:15:13,438 --> 02:15:18,307
l want you all to imagine next year,
when you've had time to perfect things.

1212
02:15:18,376 --> 02:15:22,278
Then your father will be even more
proud ofyou than he already is.

1213
02:15:23,848 --> 02:15:25,873
And you, mem?

1214
02:15:25,950 --> 02:15:28,043
Will you be?

1215
02:15:36,360 --> 02:15:39,488
l will always be proud ofyou, my children.

1216
02:16:02,920 --> 02:16:06,617
l... ordered this some time ago
for the children, you know.

1217
02:16:06,724 --> 02:16:09,784
lt's a fine example of scientific thinking,

1218
02:16:10,795 --> 02:16:13,286
as music is mathematical in nature.

1219
02:16:14,732 --> 02:16:18,532
Chords constructed from notes
in intervals ofthirds,

1220
02:16:19,971 --> 02:16:23,065
and so on, and so on.

1221
02:16:24,041 --> 02:16:26,305
Precisely.

1222
02:16:34,318 --> 02:16:37,617
l would like to know... why,

1223
02:16:38,923 --> 02:16:42,950
if science can unravel
something as beautiful as music,

1224
02:16:43,961 --> 02:16:48,057
why it cannot posit a solution
for a schoolteacher and a king.

1225
02:16:49,534 --> 02:16:53,834
The manner in which
people might understand

1226
02:16:53,938 --> 02:16:57,066
such new possibilities is

1227
02:16:57,174 --> 02:17:00,268
also process of evolution.

1228
02:17:02,680 --> 02:17:05,046
Everything in Siam has its own time.

1229
02:17:10,755 --> 02:17:13,781
Even if king is also wanting it to be different.

1230
02:17:17,228 --> 02:17:19,287
l still must go, Your Majesty.

1231
02:17:27,905 --> 02:17:29,395
So,

1232
02:17:29,473 --> 02:17:31,566
where is it you will be going?

1233
02:17:34,011 --> 02:17:36,070
England.

1234
02:17:38,249 --> 02:17:40,308
Home.

1235
02:17:42,386 --> 02:17:44,445
This is good, mem.

1236
02:17:44,522 --> 02:17:47,047
Very good for Louis as well.

1237
02:17:58,936 --> 02:18:01,029
What?

1238
02:18:03,341 --> 02:18:05,434
Am wondering if,

1239
02:18:06,210 --> 02:18:08,269
given circumstances,

1240
02:18:09,814 --> 02:18:12,282
it is appropriate

1241
02:18:13,117 --> 02:18:15,210
for king to ask

1242
02:18:16,354 --> 02:18:18,481
Anna

1243
02:18:18,556 --> 02:18:20,649
to dance.

1244
02:18:25,262 --> 02:18:28,288
l have danced with a king before,
Your Majesty.

1245
02:18:34,171 --> 02:18:36,264
And l

1246
02:18:39,310 --> 02:18:41,369
an Englishwoman.

1247
02:19:09,206 --> 02:19:11,299
Until now,

1248
02:19:12,910 --> 02:19:15,003
Madam Leonowens,

1249
02:19:16,414 --> 02:19:18,974
l did not understand supposition

1250
02:19:20,017 --> 02:19:24,386
man could be satisfied
with only one woman.

1251
02:20:14,872 --> 02:20:17,602
l was onlya boy,

1252
02:20:17,675 --> 02:20:22,476
but the image ofmyfatherholding
the woman he lovedfor the last time

1253
02:20:22,580 --> 02:20:25,549
has remained with me throughout the years.

1254
02:20:26,550 --> 02:20:31,817
lt is always surprising howsmalla part oflife
is taken up bymeaningfulmoments.

1255
02:20:33,758 --> 02:20:36,989
Most often theyare overbefore theystart,

1256
02:20:37,094 --> 02:20:40,586
although they casta light on the future

1257
02:20:40,664 --> 02:20:44,464
and make the person
who originated them unforgettable.

1258
02:20:46,170 --> 02:20:50,573
Anna hadshinedsuch a light on Siam.
