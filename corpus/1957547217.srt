[Mary Beth]
That's the last of it.

7
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:29,940
Do I get a hello?

8
00:02:32,478 --> 00:02:34,438
Hmm. Oh, wow!

9
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,672
You hung those, huh?

10
00:02:35,714 --> 00:02:37,874
You wouldn't let me hang them.

11
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,676
[sighs]

12
00:02:39,718 --> 00:02:41,979
Kev help you get
all this packed up for me?

13
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:43,687
No, I'm perfectly capable of...

14
00:02:44,823 --> 00:02:45,716
Never mind.

15
00:02:45,758 --> 00:02:46,917
Uh, hi.

16
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,687
- Hmm, you doing okay?
- Yes.

17
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:51,695
No.

18
00:02:52,531 --> 00:02:53,697
Maybe. You?

19
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:56,727
Fine. Yeah.

20
00:02:56,769 --> 00:03:01,932
Well, I certainly didn't expect
a pandemic and then a divorce,

21
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:03,874
and the timing
sure isn't good for me.

22
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,876
For you?

23
00:03:06,945 --> 00:03:08,505
Really, Bill?

24
00:03:08,547 --> 00:03:10,474
This can't come
as a big surprise.

25
00:03:10,516 --> 00:03:12,816
You haven't been in this
marriage for a very long time.

26
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,846
Yeah, no. No, it hasn't.

27
00:03:15,888 --> 00:03:16,987
[sighs]

28
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,824
It took both of us to get here,
but you know what?

29
00:03:22,094 --> 00:03:23,660
I'm going to start over.

30
00:03:24,897 --> 00:03:25,889
[scoffs]

31
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:26,897
Okay.

32
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,326
Okay.

33
00:03:29,368 --> 00:03:30,334
I get it.

34
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:33,897
Look, uh, where's Kev?

35
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:35,832
Grocery store.

36
00:03:35,874 --> 00:03:38,035
Well, like it or not,
we have a child together.

37
00:03:38,077 --> 00:03:39,703
I'm going to see him.

38
00:03:39,745 --> 00:03:42,773
Of course.
This is between you and me.

39
00:03:42,815 --> 00:03:46,043
You can see Kev whenever you
want, whenever he wants.

40
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:47,911
He's almost 17,
he'll come to you.

41
00:03:47,953 --> 00:03:49,513
Hmm.

42
00:03:49,555 --> 00:03:52,622
Listen, my friend Wanda
is on her way over.

43
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:55,852
[scoffs]

44
00:03:55,894 --> 00:03:58,061
Okay. Well, you know, I just wanted
this to end on an okay note, but, uh...

45
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:00,824
You take care.

46
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,559
I just need
you to be here for Kev.

47
00:04:02,601 --> 00:04:03,967
This isn't easy for him.

48
00:04:04,837 --> 00:04:05,836
Yeah, I know.

49
00:04:07,072 --> 00:04:08,098
I know.

50
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,608
Look, you know, in spite of
what's happened...

51
00:04:12,511 --> 00:04:15,145
I'm here for you and Kev,
always.

52
00:04:16,115 --> 00:04:17,881
Can't pretend
20 years was nothing.

53
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,120
[chuckles]

54
00:04:25,023 --> 00:04:26,350
All right.

55
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:29,720
[mellow music playing]

56
00:04:29,762 --> 00:04:31,094
Close this.

57
00:04:32,097 --> 00:04:33,730
[door closes]

58
00:04:47,045 --> 00:04:48,372
Hi.

59
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:49,940
Hey.

60
00:04:49,982 --> 00:04:51,675
Hubby?

61
00:04:51,717 --> 00:04:53,116
Soon to be ex-hubby.

62
00:04:57,156 --> 00:04:58,849
For you.

63
00:04:58,891 --> 00:05:01,385
I'm really not in a very
good place right now, Wanda.

64
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:03,660
I know my friend.
Just open it.

65
00:05:15,174 --> 00:05:16,640
I love it. I do.

66
00:05:18,577 --> 00:05:20,844
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

67
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,408
Well, sit.
Come and sit for a minute.

68
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,742
You got somewhere to be?

69
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,878
- A hot date or something?
- [laughs]

70
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,119
You know that's not true.

71
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:36,226
Okay, you know, the timing
might be really off...

72
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:38,929
or maybe it's perfect. I...

73
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,626
I've been planning
a road trip up north.

74
00:05:42,668 --> 00:05:43,667
Why don't you come with me?

75
00:05:44,736 --> 00:05:46,463
Oh, my goodness!

76
00:05:46,505 --> 00:05:48,031
I'm not up for a vacation.

77
00:05:48,073 --> 00:05:50,467
I've got Kevin to think about
and it's a pandemic.

78
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:52,936
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm not thinking vacation.

79
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:54,771
I'm thinking journey,

80
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,840
in my RV,

81
00:05:56,882 --> 00:06:01,478
sort of a quest, like,
Monty Python in the Holy Grail, kinda.

82
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,979
You're serious.

83
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:04,981
Yes, absolutely.

84
00:06:05,023 --> 00:06:07,224
And I have all these amazing
places I want to show you.

85
00:06:08,093 --> 00:06:09,920
I bet your mom
would stay with Kevin.

86
00:06:09,962 --> 00:06:11,822
Again, it's a pandemic.

87
00:06:11,864 --> 00:06:14,524
Yeah, but they'd be
totally safe here.

88
00:06:14,566 --> 00:06:17,928
You wouldn't have to worry about
them at all and his dad's close by.

89
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,164
Don't remind me, though my mother
thought he was a great catch.

90
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:23,974
A great catch?
Like a prize trout?

91
00:06:25,711 --> 00:06:27,577
Oh, sorry, it's...

92
00:06:28,814 --> 00:06:30,247
not a good time for jokes.

93
00:06:31,283 --> 00:06:32,983
It just sounded so archaic.

94
00:06:34,152 --> 00:06:35,585
Not archaic.

95
00:06:36,755 --> 00:06:39,483
I grew up
in a small Midwestern town.

96
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:42,692
It came with expectations
for your daughter manual.

97
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:45,896
That included grandchildren
of course.

98
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:48,999
Best part of all of this
is Kevin.

99
00:06:51,136 --> 00:06:52,496
I envy you.

100
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:54,064
Me?

101
00:06:54,106 --> 00:06:56,766
I know you, Mary Beth,
but I don't really know you.

102
00:06:56,808 --> 00:06:58,542
I know
what I see on the outside.

103
00:06:59,177 --> 00:07:00,210
You're calm...

104
00:07:01,246 --> 00:07:02,212
poised...

105
00:07:03,282 --> 00:07:04,875
supermom.

106
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:06,550
I envy you.

107
00:07:07,252 --> 00:07:10,554
You're so self-assured
and gutsy.

108
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,056
I've forgotten how to be a...

109
00:07:14,693 --> 00:07:16,753
badass woman.

110
00:07:16,795 --> 00:07:18,188
Come on, I am.

111
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,123
I bet there's still
a badass inside there.

112
00:07:20,165 --> 00:07:22,192
I know there is and she's
just itching to get out

113
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:23,894
and go on a road trip.

114
00:07:23,936 --> 00:07:26,196
Oh, hey,

115
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:29,239
you told me that you used to be a
professional fashion photographer, right?

116
00:07:30,175 --> 00:07:33,243
Well, I pulled this off the wall
from the Laundromat and I think...

117
00:07:34,713 --> 00:07:36,006
you ought to do it.

118
00:07:36,048 --> 00:07:38,148
A photography contest?

119
00:07:39,184 --> 00:07:40,644
[sighs]

120
00:07:40,686 --> 00:07:42,546
Me, taking professional
photos again?

121
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:44,881
You are out of your mind.

122
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,784
Oh, come on. Don't give me
that I can't do it stuff.

123
00:07:47,826 --> 00:07:51,054
Of course you can and you
should on our journey.

124
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,823
What, are we we're heading to
the set of a Vogue shoot?

125
00:07:53,865 --> 00:07:56,066
Oh, be open, Mary Beth.

126
00:07:58,804 --> 00:07:59,979
Have I ever stood you wrong?

127
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,237
Okay, the 5k was something
I thought you could handle.

128
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,134
You did come in 25th.

129
00:08:04,176 --> 00:08:06,636
There were 26 runners.

130
00:08:06,678 --> 00:08:09,739
To be fair,
I really don't like to run.

131
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,641
It is all in the journey,
Mary Beth.

132
00:08:11,683 --> 00:08:12,676
You got to trust me.

133
00:08:12,718 --> 00:08:15,612
You know, we may not find
the Holy Grail, baby,

134
00:08:15,654 --> 00:08:18,248
but we'll have a hell of a
good time looking for it.

135
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,951
Come on,
go pack a bag and call your mom.

136
00:08:20,993 --> 00:08:22,325

[playful music playing]

138
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:28,965
Okay.

139
00:08:30,702 --> 00:08:31,835
Uh, I'll do it!

140
00:08:33,271 --> 00:08:34,237
Yes!

141
00:08:35,173 --> 00:08:37,000
I'll... I'll do it!

142
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:38,969
Yes!

143
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:43,306
I'll pack my camera
and see what happens.

144
00:08:43,348 --> 00:08:45,108
How did I let you into my life?

145
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,743
[laughs]

146
00:08:46,785 --> 00:08:48,845
Well, as your loyal and trusty
delivery person,

147
00:08:48,887 --> 00:08:53,617
I did deliver about a package a
day to you for over two months.

148
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:55,685
Did you ever use all that
toilet paper by the way?

149
00:08:55,727 --> 00:08:59,022
You said RV,
I'll supply the toilet paper.

150
00:08:59,064 --> 00:09:01,124
It's the least I can do.

151
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,160
I'm going to go get the RV ready.
This is going to be so much fun.

152
00:09:04,202 --> 00:09:05,729
[Mary Beth] Wanda.

153
00:09:05,771 --> 00:09:07,864
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

154
00:09:07,906 --> 00:09:09,866
For what?

155
00:09:09,908 --> 00:09:10,874
Just...

156
00:09:11,777 --> 00:09:12,909
thanks.

157
00:09:14,446 --> 00:09:15,679

[whistling]

160
00:09:39,471 --> 00:09:41,798
I'll put this in your room
for you.

161
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,834
I still have no idea
why you want to do this.

162
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,903
Thanks, Kev.

163
00:09:46,945 --> 00:09:50,880
I'm thinking of this as me being
brave, new beginning and all.

164
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:04,994
Before Wanda burst into my life,
it was like, I was swimming in mud,

165
00:10:05,864 --> 00:10:09,826
slowly, backwards,
actually with very little oxygen,

166
00:10:09,868 --> 00:10:11,027
[sighs]

167
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,063
But then,

168
00:10:13,105 --> 00:10:17,100
she delivered this teapot from
a long ago lover named Barbara

169
00:10:17,142 --> 00:10:19,876
and it was like I woke up.

170
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,205
I felt alive again...

171
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:28,778
and it made me realize that
I had to get out of the mud.

172
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,954
[cellphone rings]

173
00:10:33,158 --> 00:10:34,157
Wanda.

174
00:10:35,026 --> 00:10:37,287
<i>You ready to rock 'n' roll?</i>

175
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:39,923
<i>Hey, don't back out on me now.
You know, I need this as much as you do.</i>

176
00:10:39,965 --> 00:10:41,458
I'm getting there.

177
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,227
I'm not really sure
if I'm packing the right stuff.

178
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:47,197
You know, you do realize we met
because of all the various things

179
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:50,834
that you purchased online when this pandemic
started and that I delivered to you.

181
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:57,373
- <i>I'll finish packing. You ready?</i>
- I'm always ready.

182
00:10:57,415 --> 00:10:58,842
I'll see you soon.

183
00:10:58,884 --> 00:11:00,877
- <i>Wanda.</i>
- Yeah.

184
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:03,780
<i>I'm glad you were literally
delivered into my life.</i>

185
00:11:03,822 --> 00:11:05,148
[chuckles]
Funny.

186
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:08,084
At your service, ma'am,
and right back at you.

187
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:09,092
I'll see you soon.

188
00:11:13,231 --> 00:11:15,925
[laughs]

189
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,834
This is going to be so much fun.

190
00:11:19,404 --> 00:11:21,371
This could be
a terrible mistake.

191
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:25,275
Yee-haw!

194

all those years ago.</i>

195
00:11:51,937 --> 00:11:57,333
<i>When you sent that teapot a few months
ago, every memory came flooding back.</i>

196
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:00,944
<i>London and then those weeks
at Big Sur.</i>

197
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,613
<i>What could have been?</i>

198
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,249
<i>You and me.</i>

[cellphone rings]

200
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,391
Hi, mom.

201
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:23,359
<i>Have you completely
lost your mind?</i>

202
00:12:23,401 --> 00:12:25,962
Oh, good morning to you too.

203
00:12:26,004 --> 00:12:30,533
<i>Ugh, you do realize
that this pandemic isn't over.</i>

204
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:33,069
Yes, of course I do.
Why do you have a mask on?

205
00:12:33,111 --> 00:12:35,972
Because they say,
a mask protects you.

206
00:12:36,014 --> 00:12:38,408
You're sitting outside
on your patio, it's...

207
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:41,885
it's going out among other
humans that you put a mask on.

208
00:12:42,654 --> 00:12:44,480
<i>I'm making a point.</i>

209
00:12:44,522 --> 00:12:46,149
[sighs]

210
00:12:46,191 --> 00:12:48,151
<i>So why the hell
would you go on a...</i>

211
00:12:48,193 --> 00:12:49,853
<i>Well, a vacation?</i>

212
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:51,554
It's not a vacation.

213
00:12:51,596 --> 00:12:53,890
Thanks for coming
to stay with Kevin.

214
00:12:53,932 --> 00:12:57,527
Bill's going to be around,
but says he'll be doing his own traveling.

215
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:00,563
<i>Oh, what does he think about
your little adventure?</i>

216
00:13:00,605 --> 00:13:03,933
I haven't told him, yet.
I'm going to tell him tonight.

217
00:13:03,975 --> 00:13:05,501
[scoffs]

218
00:13:05,543 --> 00:13:08,071
<i>Well, if he says okay
then I'll come.</i>

219
00:13:08,113 --> 00:13:10,340
Ma, you do know,
I don't need his permission.

220
00:13:10,382 --> 00:13:12,642
I'm... Our divorce is final
in a few weeks.

221
00:13:12,684 --> 00:13:14,984
I'm... I'm telling him.
I'm not asking him.

222
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:21,150
My mother is a combination
of unbridled adoration of me.

223
00:13:21,192 --> 00:13:26,656
Her only child and undisguised
judgment of me, her only child,

224
00:13:26,698 --> 00:13:30,967
but if you asked her, she doesn't
have a judgmental bone in her body.

225
00:13:31,636 --> 00:13:35,431
<i>I just have to say,
I think this is a terrible idea.</i>

226
00:13:35,473 --> 00:13:38,508
Mom, I would expect you
to say nothing less.

227
00:13:39,344 --> 00:13:42,305
Well, I've got to get going.
Lots to do.

228
00:13:42,347 --> 00:13:43,907
- See you tomorrow.
- <i>But...</i>

[groans]

230
00:13:49,087 --> 00:13:50,613
[Mary Beth] Bill,
I'm just letting you know,

231
00:13:50,655 --> 00:13:53,256
so that you can check in
on Kevin once in a while.

232
00:13:54,192 --> 00:13:56,019
Mom will be here.

233
00:13:56,061 --> 00:13:57,293
Kevin will be fine.

234
00:13:59,597 --> 00:14:00,563
Uh...

235
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:02,999
A couple weeks.

236
00:14:04,235 --> 00:14:05,201
No plan.

237
00:14:08,707 --> 00:14:10,606
They'll survive.

238
00:14:13,611 --> 00:14:14,744
I know.

239
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:17,981
This is so not me.

240
00:14:23,588 --> 00:14:24,754
Thank goodness.

241
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:29,292
- [doorbell rings]

242
00:14:34,566 --> 00:14:36,259
Mom!

243
00:14:36,301 --> 00:14:38,594
I left early.

244
00:14:38,636 --> 00:14:41,397
Thought I had better see you one last
time in case you end up in the hospital

245
00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:45,735
or have some enlightening
epiphany that changes you forever.

246
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:49,072
Leave it to you to leap
to the worst possible scenario.

247
00:14:49,114 --> 00:14:50,680
I'll be back.

248
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,784
I... I just hope you find
what you're looking for.

249
00:14:57,055 --> 00:14:59,248
You know, it's...

250
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:03,453
it's not really a good idea to
travel alone, especially for a woman.

251
00:15:03,495 --> 00:15:07,463
I'll do both
and I'm not traveling alone.

252
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:11,027
Oh, with who?

253
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:13,129
Oh, it's a long story,

254
00:15:13,171 --> 00:15:18,267
but with Wanda, that delivery
person that convinced me to do this.

255
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:22,672
Oh, so you are traveling
with a virtual stranger.

256
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,073
Oh, my God, Mary Beth!

257
00:15:24,115 --> 00:15:25,641
What do you even know about her?

258
00:15:25,683 --> 00:15:28,184
Everything that I need to know.

259
00:15:29,521 --> 00:15:32,482
I am completely baffled
by all of this.

260
00:15:32,524 --> 00:15:34,784
People get divorced
all the time,

261
00:15:34,826 --> 00:15:38,721
but it doesn't mean that you should put your
health at risk or start acting foolish.

262
00:15:38,763 --> 00:15:42,358
Foolish was putting my life
on hold for 20 years.

263
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,559
That was foolish.

264
00:15:43,601 --> 00:15:47,130
You know what? I'm not even
going to talk to you about this.

265
00:15:47,172 --> 00:15:49,432
Have you been tested?
Has this Wanda?

266
00:15:49,474 --> 00:15:52,642
Yes, and we're both negative,
so stop worrying.

267
00:15:53,845 --> 00:15:56,412
I'm going to worry, it's my job.

268
00:15:59,217 --> 00:16:01,384
Speaking of jobs, Kevin...

[truck horn honks]

- RV.
- Uh-huh.

00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:22,131
Surprise!
[laughs]

273
00:16:22,173 --> 00:16:25,468
Hey, I'm Wanda,
former delivery person,

274
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:28,211
but you can call me,
the navigator...

275
00:16:30,515 --> 00:16:33,409
or Wanda.
Wanda... Wanda works.

276
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,318
So, you must be her mother.

277
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,249
Good job, mom!

278
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,184

[chuckles]

280
00:16:42,861 --> 00:16:45,188
So what do you think?

281
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,323
I love to take off on the weekend,
so I just turned this into a food truck.

282
00:16:47,365 --> 00:16:50,259
Actually a soup truck
and it pays the expenses.

283
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,595
You know, I washed the whole
thing before I came over here

284
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:55,138
and then bugs on the freeway
decided to die on my windshield.

285
00:16:55,773 --> 00:16:59,702
This Wanda,
not exactly as I pictured her.

286
00:16:59,744 --> 00:17:01,644
Not like your usual friends.

287
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,273
I know.

288
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,615
Maybe that's why I like her.

289
00:17:08,286 --> 00:17:09,652
Kev, [inaudible]

290
00:17:10,922 --> 00:17:14,150
You and I, there?

291
00:17:14,192 --> 00:17:15,785
Yeah.

292
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:18,628
Oh, I've slept here so many
times. It's really comfy.

293
00:17:23,701 --> 00:17:25,143
I don't snore.

294
00:17:25,185 --> 00:17:26,629
Oh, and I, you know,
I can sleep on the edge.

295
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:29,132
I usually sleep like
just on the edge.

296
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:30,867
Actually here,

297
00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:33,870
sometimes, on his edge,
I just sleep like this.

298
00:17:33,912 --> 00:17:35,238
You can have...

299
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,473
Or you know what?

300
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:41,177
Sometimes I can sleep in the driver's
seat too because I'm really flexible.

301
00:17:41,219 --> 00:17:42,411
Just...

302
00:17:42,453 --> 00:17:44,447
I just do that like...

303
00:17:44,489 --> 00:17:48,384
You know, like this and just
get into a really small ball,

304
00:17:48,426 --> 00:17:50,253
and then just like, you know...

305
00:17:50,295 --> 00:17:51,821
Right.

306
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:55,525
Mom, take care
and I'll call you soon.

307
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:57,593
Don't let Kevin get away
with anything.

308
00:17:57,635 --> 00:18:00,603
Oh, you... He would be hard-pressed
to try to pull one over on me.

309
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,706
[Mary Beth] Okay.

310
00:18:06,244 --> 00:18:07,543
Time to roll.

311
00:18:10,615 --> 00:18:12,642
I didn't think
a lot of this through.

312
00:18:12,684 --> 00:18:17,713
Chalk it up to expect the
unexpected and go with it.

313
00:18:17,755 --> 00:18:19,515
- So not me.
- Hmm.

314
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,318
Okay, isn't that the point,
to try out a new you?

315
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,719
Wear this.

316
00:18:23,761 --> 00:18:25,354
- [Mary Beth] Good vibes.
- Yep.

317
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,590
[Mary Beth] I don't know.

318
00:18:27,632 --> 00:18:30,233
I don't know Wanda. Is it supposed to
sink through the cotton or something?

319
00:18:31,469 --> 00:18:32,395
Just put it on.

Holiday Inn.

324
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,821
How long do you think
it'll take before she calls?

325
00:18:52,657 --> 00:18:53,689
About an hour.

326
00:18:54,525 --> 00:18:56,259
That's what I'm thinking.

327
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:22,485
There you go!

328
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:25,381
Ever pee in the forest?

329
00:19:25,423 --> 00:19:26,789
First time for everything.

330
00:19:28,826 --> 00:19:29,952
You know, when I was a kid...

331
00:19:29,994 --> 00:19:33,489
my mom used to put this pot
in the back of the car

332
00:19:33,531 --> 00:19:36,492
for us kids to pee in
when we were traveling.

333
00:19:36,534 --> 00:19:37,800
I prefer the woods.

334
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,397
Did you know
that boys still miss

335
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:44,473
even when the hole is
a foot wide and 12 inches away.

336
00:19:46,744 --> 00:19:48,477
I have a boy, remember?

337
00:19:49,747 --> 00:19:50,973
That's right.

338
00:19:51,015 --> 00:19:52,742
[laughs]

339
00:19:52,784 --> 00:19:54,477
What?

340
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:55,511
What's so funny?

341
00:19:55,553 --> 00:19:58,748
I love the added flair
to your wardrobe.

342
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,683
Oh jeez!

343
00:20:00,725 --> 00:20:02,525
It's part of my comedy routine.

344
00:20:09,434 --> 00:20:10,926
Beautiful, isn't it?

345
00:20:10,968 --> 00:20:12,335
[camera shutter clicks]

346
00:20:13,037 --> 00:20:15,598
Just freaking beautiful.

347
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,605
Sure is.

348
00:20:18,943 --> 00:20:20,503
So tell me about this garden.

349
00:20:20,545 --> 00:20:25,841
You know, I sort of happened upon
it one weekend a long time ago.

350
00:20:25,883 --> 00:20:29,785
I was traveling and got lost,
pulled over at this cabin.

351
00:20:31,456 --> 00:20:34,056
Person who lived on the property took
me for a walk through the garden.

352
00:20:35,093 --> 00:20:37,793
And it was this beautiful...

353
00:20:38,996 --> 00:20:42,064
peaceful, calming place.

354
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:47,730
I thought it would be a great,
new beginning for our journey.

355
00:20:47,772 --> 00:20:50,473
You know, something to get our
heads in a different place.

356
00:20:52,143 --> 00:20:55,805
I've never asked you, but have
you ever been married?

357
00:20:55,847 --> 00:20:57,873
Oh, no, no.

358
00:20:57,915 --> 00:21:01,577
I've had a few relationships with
women, nothing super long term.

359
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:03,452
Nobody broke my heart
or anything...

360
00:21:04,589 --> 00:21:06,122
although, one or two came close.

361
00:21:07,925 --> 00:21:08,818
Women?

362
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,859
Hmm.

363
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:14,530
Come on, Mary Beth,
you haven't figured that out by now?

364
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:17,566
It didn't cross my mind.

365
00:21:19,003 --> 00:21:20,102
Wow!

366
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:22,765
Just wow.

367
00:21:22,807 --> 00:21:28,010
Hey, I don't care or anything if
that's what you're thinking...

368
00:21:29,781 --> 00:21:31,907
but you didn't think
maybe I was...

369
00:21:31,949 --> 00:21:33,182
You? No.

370
00:21:34,552 --> 00:21:37,580
We're just two badass women
on a mission,

371
00:21:37,622 --> 00:21:40,383
on an adventure, a journey.

372
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:41,150
[laughs]

373
00:21:41,192 --> 00:21:42,718
You and me?

374
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,761
No. Well,
that never crossed my mind.

375
00:21:53,171 --> 00:21:55,938
[mellow music playing]

376
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:06,782
Wanda,
this is absolutely gorgeous.

377
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,118
I wasn't expecting this.

378
00:22:10,054 --> 00:22:13,115
Yeah, so this is the main house

379
00:22:13,157 --> 00:22:18,120
where the spiritual leader and his
students I guess you call them, live.

380
00:22:18,162 --> 00:22:23,492
And then back there through, uh, that
gate back there is, uh, gorgeous gardens

381
00:22:23,534 --> 00:22:25,661
like you have never seen,
an orchard and everything.

382
00:22:25,703 --> 00:22:28,664
Oh, an orchard.
I hope they have an orange tree.

383
00:22:28,706 --> 00:22:30,473
[laughs]
I think they do.

384
00:22:31,108 --> 00:22:33,202
You know what? I'm going to get
us a pot of soup made,

385
00:22:33,244 --> 00:22:37,072
something, uh,
to awaken our spirits.

386
00:22:37,114 --> 00:22:41,610
Uh, ginger, curry, turmeric,
good for new beginnings.

387
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,746
- Why don't you go take a walk?
- I'd love to.

388
00:22:43,788 --> 00:22:45,554
- Yeah.
- I'm so excited.

389
00:22:46,257 --> 00:22:48,117
- I'll see you in a bit.
- Okay.

390
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,793
[tranquil music playing]

391
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,617
Oh, there's somebody here.

392
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:17,780
Hello. Hi. How are you?

393
00:23:17,822 --> 00:23:19,181
[laughs]

394
00:23:19,223 --> 00:23:21,083
Hi... Oh, I'm sorry.

395
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:23,586
Um, habit.

396
00:23:23,628 --> 00:23:27,723
I mean with this thing out there I find
breaking old habits really, really hard.

397
00:23:27,765 --> 00:23:29,558
- You?
- Yes.

398
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,027
Yes, I... I do.
I'm Mary Beth.

399
00:23:32,069 --> 00:23:33,762
Such beautiful gardens
you have here.

400
00:23:33,804 --> 00:23:35,037
Laura, me.

401
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,234
Yes. Well, thank you.

402
00:23:38,276 --> 00:23:39,502
[laughs]

403
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:41,036
They aren't my gardens actually.

404
00:23:41,078 --> 00:23:43,772
They just they belong
to my teacher, Daiku.

405
00:23:43,814 --> 00:23:45,875
I just have a room
in the big house.

406
00:23:45,917 --> 00:23:48,677
I've been here a few months
so...

407
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:49,845
You know, I'll introduce you.

408
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,180
- He's right over here.
- Great!

409
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:53,188
- [Laura] Yeah, come meet Daiku.
- Thanks.

410
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,086
[Laura] Daiku,

411
00:23:57,128 --> 00:23:58,687
let me introduce
you to Mary Beth.

412
00:23:58,729 --> 00:23:59,655
Uh, Mary Beth, um...

413
00:23:59,697 --> 00:24:01,557
Higgins.

414
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:04,126
- Hello.
- Welcome, and no need to bow. I'm not royalty.

415
00:24:04,168 --> 00:24:06,762
What brings you here?
Where did you come from?

416
00:24:06,804 --> 00:24:10,933
Sort of south west of here,
a few hours away.

417
00:24:10,975 --> 00:24:13,769
I'm with my friend Wanda,
she's back at the RV making soup.

418
00:24:13,811 --> 00:24:17,172
It's doubles as a food truck.
Her business.

419
00:24:17,214 --> 00:24:18,841
Weird, huh?

420
00:24:18,883 --> 00:24:20,683
- It's yummy.
- Not weird at all.

421
00:24:21,786 --> 00:24:24,887
Enjoy our gardens,
the beauty and tranquility, the peace.

422
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:28,584
And please,
have your friend come join us here.

423
00:24:28,626 --> 00:24:29,652
All are welcome.

424
00:24:29,694 --> 00:24:36,191
We don't get many visitors here, so it is a
treat to have new faces and new conversations.

425
00:24:36,233 --> 00:24:38,160
[Wanda] Hey, there you are.

426
00:24:38,202 --> 00:24:40,963
- Hi.
- Oh, it's just as I remember. Isn't it wonderful?

427
00:24:41,005 --> 00:24:42,298
Hi.

428
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:45,334
Hi, uh, I'm Laura
and this is Daiku.

429
00:24:45,376 --> 00:24:47,236
Oh, hi. Hi, listen,

430
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:50,839
we had rapid tests today
and we're negative.

431
00:24:50,881 --> 00:24:52,575
How about you guys?

432
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:54,176
Oh, we, we test every day
at the retreat, so...

433
00:24:54,218 --> 00:24:55,911
Yeah?
Should we take off our masks?

434
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:58,981
- Shall we?
- Let's keep our distance.

435
00:24:59,023 --> 00:25:01,056
- Welcome.
- Oh! Thanks.

436
00:25:01,892 --> 00:25:03,152
God!

437
00:25:03,194 --> 00:25:05,888
So, you've been here before?

438
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:08,357
Yeah, yeah,
about five years ago.

439
00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:11,260
I didn't stay on the property,
but I walked through with a friend

440
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:16,065
and it was so peaceful,
this beautiful, calming, place.

441
00:25:16,107 --> 00:25:18,207
I just knew why my friend
would love it here.

442
00:25:19,043 --> 00:25:24,640
She's finding something that's
missing, you know, or something lost.

443
00:25:24,682 --> 00:25:26,081
[Mary Beth] I'm looking for,
uh...

444
00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:29,652
Well, uh...

445
00:25:32,256 --> 00:25:33,255
I don't know.

446
00:25:34,091 --> 00:25:35,384
Peace,

447
00:25:35,426 --> 00:25:39,428
calm, direction, purpose.

448
00:25:40,698 --> 00:25:43,932
All can be easily lost,
but they're hard to find again.

449
00:25:45,236 --> 00:25:46,268
You're seeking.

450
00:25:47,104 --> 00:25:48,070
[Mary Beth] You nailed it.

451
00:25:48,906 --> 00:25:50,305
I am seeking.

452
00:25:51,776 --> 00:25:55,938
It's how to find it, or, gosh,
maybe I never had it.

453
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,375
Wow, I'm talking to
a complete stranger.

454
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:04,747
Oh, hey, hey, a stranger is just
a friend you haven't met yet.

455
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:06,281
Oh, hi!

456
00:26:06,323 --> 00:26:07,783
Just the two of you here?

457
00:26:07,825 --> 00:26:10,085
Uh, hey, Kris, join us.

458
00:26:10,127 --> 00:26:12,728
Oh, thank you,
but I need to go back to my cabin.

459
00:26:14,465 --> 00:26:17,159
As you can see,
there are a few others.

460
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:19,862
There are tent cabins
down that hill.

461
00:26:19,904 --> 00:26:24,933
I prefer a few people who come truly
dedicated to making changes in their lives.

462
00:26:24,975 --> 00:26:28,303
Oh, and please enjoy the
pool, it's spectacular.

463
00:26:28,345 --> 00:26:30,005
[Laura] Would you guys like
to see the house?

464
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,147
I have a room there
and Daiku lives there too.

465
00:26:33,084 --> 00:26:36,011
Please, go enjoy.
It's getting late.

466
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:38,253
Nice to meet you, Wanda,
Mary Beth.

467
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,359
Shall we? This way.

468
00:26:47,932 --> 00:26:51,033
[soft music playing]

469
00:26:54,038 --> 00:26:55,237
This is amazing!

470
00:26:56,373 --> 00:27:00,342
Warm
and cozy with the art.

471
00:27:01,312 --> 00:27:02,878
This is a great house.

472
00:27:03,881 --> 00:27:05,741
I mean, I mean great.

473
00:27:05,783 --> 00:27:07,082
I know, I love it.

474
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,278
How Daiku's decorated it.

475
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:14,083
You know, most come from his
travels or gifts from his students.

476
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:16,885
This is beautiful.
Does it have a special meaning?

477
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:18,253
[Laura] Ah.

478
00:27:18,295 --> 00:27:19,788
Yeah.

479
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,791
She is the green goddess Tara.

480
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:25,234
She symbolizes compassion
and liberation.

481
00:27:26,237 --> 00:27:29,238
Revered as a woman
who brings healing and serenity.

482
00:27:30,474 --> 00:27:32,067
Hey, can I use your bathroom?

483
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:33,876
Of course, it's just down there.

484
00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:37,840
Well, hey,
why don't we provide dinner tonight?

485
00:27:37,882 --> 00:27:39,775
I have a big pot of soup
I made out in the van.

486
00:27:39,817 --> 00:27:40,776
Are you a vegetarian?

487
00:27:40,818 --> 00:27:42,511
- Mm-hmm.
- Daiku?

488
00:27:42,553 --> 00:27:47,049
Yes, but he won't be joining us.
He eats alone. His thing.

489
00:27:47,091 --> 00:27:48,817
All right, just checking.

490
00:27:48,859 --> 00:27:51,353
Wanda's famous
butternut squash soup.

491
00:27:51,395 --> 00:27:53,756
A little ginger.
Oh, it's so good.

492
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:57,059
Caring is sharing as they say
or sharing is caring,

493
00:27:57,101 --> 00:27:59,001
or I don't know,
something like that.

494
00:27:59,937 --> 00:28:01,196
[both chuckle]

495
00:28:01,238 --> 00:28:02,397
Oh, you know,
I'm going to go change.

496
00:28:02,439 --> 00:28:03,906
Um, have a look around.

497
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:06,809
And I... I like your friend.

498
00:28:07,845 --> 00:28:11,213
[tranquil music playing]

499
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:25,227
[Mary Beth] <i>Just be.</i>

500
00:28:27,198 --> 00:28:29,925
Okay, can I get you
something to drink?

501
00:28:29,967 --> 00:28:34,296
You want, um, orange juice,
carrot juice, celery juice?

502
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:35,531
No thanks.

503
00:28:35,573 --> 00:28:36,532
A glass of wine?

504
00:28:36,574 --> 00:28:38,100
[chuckles]

505
00:28:38,142 --> 00:28:39,575
The wine, I'll take.
You get wine here?

506
00:28:41,078 --> 00:28:42,044
[Laura] Well...

507
00:28:46,617 --> 00:28:48,617
No, we don't get wine here.

508
00:28:50,988 --> 00:28:52,120
Our secret.

509
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,289
Okay, so...

510
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:58,053
tell me all about
Mary Beth Higgins.

511
00:28:58,095 --> 00:28:59,488
Who are you?

512
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,256
The big question.

513
00:29:01,298 --> 00:29:02,858
[laughs]

514
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,526
Just say the first thing
that comes to mind.

515
00:29:04,568 --> 00:29:08,030
Wash them, squeaky clean.

516
00:29:08,072 --> 00:29:09,231
I'll go get the soup.

517
00:29:09,273 --> 00:29:10,439
Give me a few.

518
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:15,270
So...

519
00:29:15,312 --> 00:29:19,581
When I left the house
this morning, I was a mom...

520
00:29:20,918 --> 00:29:22,217
a daughter...

521
00:29:23,454 --> 00:29:27,022
a wife,
though soon to be ex-wife.

522
00:29:28,025 --> 00:29:31,126
I meditate too
like you, a meditator.

523
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,556
That's all.

524
00:29:34,598 --> 00:29:37,532
Well, that's actually
just a list of titles.

525
00:29:38,602 --> 00:29:40,002
Jobs.

526
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:42,337
Seriously, who are you?

527
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:47,536
Or is it too soon to pry?
I'm sorry. I just...

528
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:50,512
I'm just always so curious
as to why people are seekers.

529
00:29:51,515 --> 00:29:55,651
Like, what makes them wake up in the
morning and decide to do something, like...

530
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:59,454
Well, like show up here.

531
00:30:00,524 --> 00:30:02,284
[Mary Beth]
<i>Be open.</i>

532
00:30:02,326 --> 00:30:03,992
<i>Be brave Mary Beth.</i>

533
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:07,162
In a few weeks...

534
00:30:08,532 --> 00:30:10,399
my divorce will be final.

535
00:30:11,535 --> 00:30:14,670
Twenty years and voila...

536
00:30:16,373 --> 00:30:18,233
a marriage over.

537
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:19,975
Hmm, it's tough.

538
00:30:21,245 --> 00:30:22,210
Your choice?

539
00:30:23,681 --> 00:30:24,680
My choice.

540
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:29,444
And did he find someone else
or did you?

541
00:30:29,486 --> 00:30:31,013
[groans]

542
00:30:31,055 --> 00:30:33,055
You know,
it's nothing like that.

543
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:38,660
I received a gift from an old
friend, a teapot and...

544
00:30:41,999 --> 00:30:44,075
and a cup.

545
00:30:44,117 --> 00:30:46,234
A memory from a very
close relationship 20 years ago.

546
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:48,403
It was a wake-up call.

547
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,334
My life has been
very predictable, uh,

548
00:30:52,376 --> 00:30:54,543
rote, not bad...

549
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:58,146
very lucky in a sense, just...

550
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,615
not...

551
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:03,412
Fulfilling?

552
00:31:03,454 --> 00:31:05,981
Worth rolling out of bed
in the morning.

553
00:31:06,023 --> 00:31:07,456
A teapot...

554
00:31:08,392 --> 00:31:12,461
and photos of my life before,
it all just became...

555
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:15,764
decades of going through
the motions.

556
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,533
The memories came flooding back.

557
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,371
I took a very good look
at my marriage.

558
00:31:23,374 --> 00:31:24,406
So did Bill.

559
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,376
It's over.

560
00:31:29,546 --> 00:31:31,079
I'm still processing that.

561
00:31:33,117 --> 00:31:36,445
And this memory, was he a lover?

562
00:31:36,487 --> 00:31:37,619
She.

563
00:31:38,489 --> 00:31:40,182
Yes.

564
00:31:40,224 --> 00:31:44,659
Oh, I'm not gay or anything
just to be very clear.

565
00:31:45,496 --> 00:31:48,423
It was a short thing, a fling.

566
00:31:48,465 --> 00:31:49,691
Hmm.

567
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:51,533
Not a fling exactly.

568
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:59,167
I was married very soon after it
and it was the right thing to do.

569
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:01,243
- For who?
- For me.

570
00:32:04,081 --> 00:32:06,681
My parents, society.

571
00:32:09,286 --> 00:32:12,280
I can't believe,
I'm saying this to a complete stranger,

572
00:32:12,322 --> 00:32:14,282
that I slept with a woman.

573
00:32:14,324 --> 00:32:17,719
And now that she's going
to think that I'm gay or...

574
00:32:17,761 --> 00:32:20,128
or that I'm in a relationship
with Wanda.

575
00:32:20,764 --> 00:32:24,326
Oh, come on, Mary Beth,
not everyone is so judgmental.

576
00:32:24,368 --> 00:32:27,269
You know, in just a few sentences
you told me who you are.

577
00:32:29,506 --> 00:32:30,472
A woman.

578
00:32:32,476 --> 00:32:34,209
A woman
who is changing her life.

579
00:32:35,546 --> 00:32:37,412
Being single
yet bound to a child.

580
00:32:38,615 --> 00:32:40,782
A woman
who questions her desires...

581
00:32:42,186 --> 00:32:43,712
and for whom.

582
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:45,554
A woman
who makes a decision once...

583
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:49,151
and decides to never look back.

584
00:32:49,193 --> 00:32:52,320
[Wanda] I'm back. Oh, this pot's hot.
I'm just going to go put it down.

585
00:32:52,362 --> 00:32:55,457
You know, I flushed most of this
down my leg and into my shoe.

586
00:32:55,499 --> 00:32:57,759
I got a lot on the driveway too.

587
00:32:57,801 --> 00:33:00,562
Whoo, I just wanted to
put that down.

588
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:02,264
There's a hose out there.
I can go wash it off.

589
00:33:02,306 --> 00:33:04,132
Mice or ants or something
will come to eat that.

590
00:33:04,174 --> 00:33:05,600
No, no, no, stop.

591
00:33:05,642 --> 00:33:07,402
Even ants and mice
need a gourmet meal.

592
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:09,104
[Wanda sighs]

593
00:33:09,146 --> 00:33:10,338
- Really?
- [Laura] Yeah, it smells wonderful.

594
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,140
Oh, thank you.

595
00:33:12,182 --> 00:33:13,775
[Laura] Mm-hmm.

596
00:33:13,817 --> 00:33:15,444
- You know, my RV doubles as a food truck.
- Hmm?

597
00:33:15,486 --> 00:33:17,779
Yeah, I just pull into a parking
lot somewhere,

598
00:33:17,821 --> 00:33:21,249
slap the sign on the side of
the van and then I sell soup.

599
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:22,784
One soup, whatever soup
I've made that day.

600
00:33:22,826 --> 00:33:24,853
Pays for the gas,
pays for the food.

601
00:33:24,895 --> 00:33:27,222
A true, genuine, free spirit.

602
00:33:27,264 --> 00:33:28,423
[all laugh]

603
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:31,526
That's me, me and my sidekick.

604
00:33:31,568 --> 00:33:34,863
Oh, well, you certainly don't
like energy, do you?

605
00:33:34,905 --> 00:33:36,131
[sighs]

606
00:33:36,173 --> 00:33:37,339
Is that a gong?

607
00:33:38,675 --> 00:33:40,268
What a great dinner bell.

608
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,736
Go for it. Hit it.

609
00:33:41,778 --> 00:33:43,512
[laughs]

610
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:46,274
[bell dings]

611
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:48,376
[all laugh]

612
00:33:48,418 --> 00:33:50,745
- Do you feel that?
- Yes.

613
00:33:50,787 --> 00:33:51,847
Boy, that's addictive.

614
00:33:51,889 --> 00:33:53,148
[bell dings]

615
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,322
[laughs]

616
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:57,452
Did it get cold?

617
00:33:57,494 --> 00:33:59,254
Are you kidding me?

618
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,223
- It's delicious.
- You made this today in the van?

619
00:34:01,265 --> 00:34:02,591
It's so good!

620
00:34:02,633 --> 00:34:05,560
[indistinct chatter]

621
00:34:05,602 --> 00:34:07,802
- To girl time.
- To girl time!

622
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,769
[all laughing]

623
00:34:14,811 --> 00:34:17,445
[indistinct chatter]

624
00:34:18,649 --> 00:34:20,448
Stop it. Stop it.

625
00:34:22,786 --> 00:34:25,714
I'm just going to run this pot
out to the van.

626
00:34:25,756 --> 00:34:27,816
You know what?

627
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:29,251
I'm actually really tired.
I think I'm just going to go to bed.

628
00:34:29,293 --> 00:34:30,819
You can come out
when you're ready.

629
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:32,854
- I'm ready.
- Fine.

630
00:34:32,896 --> 00:34:35,157
I'm going to take out the sleeping
bag and sleep on the floor.

631
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,758
You can take the bed.
I just toss and turn when I'm knackered.

632
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,693
[Laura]
You know what? Just stay here.

633
00:34:38,735 --> 00:34:41,296
I mean, Wanda, you get a good
night's sleep in a real bed

634
00:34:41,338 --> 00:34:43,598
and Mary Beth just sleep here.

635
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,640
Both of you
can get a good night's sleep.

636
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:52,541
Oh, um, okay. Well, if you...
If you're sure about it.

637
00:34:52,583 --> 00:34:54,176
Actually,
I think it's a great idea.

638
00:34:54,218 --> 00:34:56,511
You've done all the driving
and cooking.

639
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:57,719
Get a good sleep.

640
00:34:59,957 --> 00:35:01,249
Okay, yeah.

641
00:35:01,291 --> 00:35:02,317
You want your bag?

642
00:35:02,359 --> 00:35:04,226
I'll sleep in my T-shirt.

643
00:35:04,962 --> 00:35:05,961
Right.

644
00:35:07,764 --> 00:35:10,899
Okay. Well, I'll see in the
morning, out in the gardens.

645
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:14,229
- Sleep well.
- [Mary Beth] I will.

646
00:35:14,271 --> 00:35:15,630
Wanda, love the soup.

647
00:35:15,672 --> 00:35:18,240
[Laura] Yes, loved it.
Thank you so much.

648
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:20,918
Good night.

649
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,870
[Wanda] Knackered,
I'm knackered.

650
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:23,645
Let's get some sleep.

651
00:35:31,622 --> 00:35:32,921
[Laura]
All right.

652
00:35:34,258 --> 00:35:36,384
- Extra pillow?
- Thanks.

653
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:39,354
And it's pretty comfy
and help yourself to anything.

654
00:35:39,396 --> 00:35:40,589
So...

655
00:35:40,631 --> 00:35:42,891
- Appreciate it.
- Hmm.

656
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,032
You know, it's still early.

657
00:35:44,968 --> 00:35:46,828
You want to get in the hot tub?

658
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:48,770
I go every night
before I go to sleep.

659
00:35:50,574 --> 00:35:52,234
No swimsuit.

660
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:55,377
Well, if you're shy
just go in your underwear.

661
00:35:56,346 --> 00:35:58,046
Personally, nude works for me.

662
00:35:59,883 --> 00:36:01,316
Uh...

663
00:36:02,586 --> 00:36:03,785
I don't know.

664
00:36:04,688 --> 00:36:06,755
Come on,
you'll sleep like a baby...

665
00:36:07,991 --> 00:36:10,285
and I can go underwear too,
you know.

666
00:36:10,327 --> 00:36:11,426
Come on.

667
00:36:18,502 --> 00:36:19,901
What did I get myself into?

668
00:36:20,737 --> 00:36:23,004
Ooh, it's nice.

669
00:36:31,048 --> 00:36:32,847
So, I have a question for you.

670
00:36:34,718 --> 00:36:36,017
Why did you come here?

671
00:36:38,889 --> 00:36:40,388
Well, um...

672
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:44,092
my mom died a couple months ago.

673
00:36:45,395 --> 00:36:47,929
Not COVID-19, but...

674
00:36:49,066 --> 00:36:50,398
died in a hospital.

675
00:36:53,804 --> 00:36:55,804
She went into the hospital
and...

676
00:36:57,774 --> 00:37:01,743
the last time I was near her was as
they lowered her casket into the ground.

677
00:37:03,747 --> 00:37:05,447
No people at her funeral.

678
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:07,649
No closure.

679
00:37:08,618 --> 00:37:09,718
So...

680
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:15,056
I'm still working through
my grief and...

681
00:37:16,727 --> 00:37:17,926
being okay with being alone.

682
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:20,762
I'm getting there.

683
00:37:23,467 --> 00:37:25,667
I'm getting there.
I am and Daiku helps.

684
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,069
He helps me cope.

685
00:37:32,008 --> 00:37:33,408
Thank you for sharing that.

686
00:37:35,612 --> 00:37:36,678
I love the water.

687
00:37:37,681 --> 00:37:38,847
It heals me...

688
00:37:40,684 --> 00:37:42,150
and when I'm in it, I feel...

689
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,788
a peace, cleansing...

690
00:37:48,859 --> 00:37:50,692
my heart slows down and...

691
00:37:51,928 --> 00:37:53,695
my breathing quiets. Here...

692
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,131
give me your hand.

693
00:37:58,001 --> 00:37:59,461
Feel.

694
00:37:59,503 --> 00:38:02,564
[soft music playing]

695
00:38:02,606 --> 00:38:03,905
[chuckles]

696
00:38:10,046 --> 00:38:11,579
Can I photograph you?

697
00:38:15,819 --> 00:38:16,744
Why?

698
00:38:16,786 --> 00:38:17,752
I used to be a photographer
and...

699
00:38:18,688 --> 00:38:20,749
I'd like to enter this contest.

700
00:38:20,791 --> 00:38:24,159
Well, actually Wanda would like
me to enter this contest and...

701
00:38:25,695 --> 00:38:28,496
and I would like for you
to be my first subject.

702
00:38:30,534 --> 00:38:32,167
Well then, sure. Yeah.

703
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:34,169
Wonderful.

704
00:38:38,775 --> 00:38:41,476
Hmm.
This was a good idea.

705
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,034
Oh, hi ladies.

706
00:39:46,076 --> 00:39:48,036
Good morning.
Did you have a nice evening?

707
00:39:48,078 --> 00:39:49,904
- It was very good.
- Yeah.

708
00:39:49,946 --> 00:39:52,847
Hey, he's a very cool guy.
Just told me to quiet my mind.

709
00:39:55,652 --> 00:39:56,818
Please, sit.

710
00:39:58,688 --> 00:39:59,914
Oh.

711
00:39:59,956 --> 00:40:02,016
Hey, um, you know, I...

712
00:40:02,058 --> 00:40:06,621
I've never meditated before,
do we say the Om thing and, um, and...

713
00:40:06,663 --> 00:40:10,258
And how do we...
How do we sit?

714
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,093
I think... Is it palms down?

715
00:40:12,135 --> 00:40:14,028
No, no, no.

716
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,763
Sorry, I saw a photo with palms
up, right? Palms up?

717
00:40:15,805 --> 00:40:19,000
And...
and how do I sit? Is...

718
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,768
is it the... the legs are...

719
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:23,638
Is it right over left
or is it the left over the right

720
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,840
because well, you know,
I could do both.

721
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:28,576
Just relax.
There are no rigid rules here.

722
00:40:28,618 --> 00:40:30,318
In fact, rigid isn't
part of this at all.

723
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,748
Just try to relax your mind.

724
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:36,024
Relax, okay. Relax my mind.

725
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:39,093
[clears throat]

726
00:40:46,303 --> 00:40:48,770
Om.

727
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:55,343
Om.

728
00:40:57,714 --> 00:41:00,348
No Om, just quiet.

729
00:41:02,018 --> 00:41:02,984
Quiet.

730
00:41:03,887 --> 00:41:05,246
I'll give it a whirl.

731
00:41:05,288 --> 00:41:06,681
[laughs]

732
00:41:06,723 --> 00:41:07,689
Okay, sorry.

733
00:41:10,594 --> 00:41:13,121
My students come here
with many questions,

734
00:41:13,163 --> 00:41:15,330
but at the core
is one basic question.

735
00:41:16,333 --> 00:41:17,365
Who am I?

736
00:41:19,002 --> 00:41:20,068
Then come the others.

737
00:41:21,738 --> 00:41:23,638
Am I truly living my best life?

738
00:41:25,141 --> 00:41:26,608
Will I find love and peace?

739
00:41:28,311 --> 00:41:30,638
Let go of the phrase I am.

740
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,274
[Mary Beth] <i>I'd love to photograph
Laura, she's stunning.</i>

741
00:41:33,316 --> 00:41:35,209
<i>My first photo shoot.</i>

742
00:41:35,251 --> 00:41:36,945
- [Daiku] Come to this day...
- [Mary Beth] <i>A new beginning.</i>

743
00:41:36,987 --> 00:41:38,753
...that you must define
yourselves, but you cannot.

744
00:41:39,923 --> 00:41:41,222
You're ever changing...

745
00:41:42,759 --> 00:41:43,992
ever floating...

746
00:41:44,894 --> 00:41:45,893
ever learning.

747
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,631
Just be.

748
00:41:53,403 --> 00:41:56,170
Just be.

749
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:08,349
I hope your journey brings you
everything you're looking for.

750
00:42:15,258 --> 00:42:18,086
This is just the beginning
for you, you know.

751
00:42:18,128 --> 00:42:19,988
Be open to

752
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,863
peace, love

753
00:42:22,899 --> 00:42:24,225
now-ness.

754
00:42:24,267 --> 00:42:25,233
Love?

755
00:42:26,703 --> 00:42:27,935
Not right now.

756
00:42:29,105 --> 00:42:30,104
Someday.

757
00:42:31,074 --> 00:42:32,273
[Laura] Love will come.

758
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:35,743
I think it'll be with a...

759
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,347
sharing of life kind of person.

760
00:42:40,684 --> 00:42:44,946
Not a certain gender or age
or expectation.

761
00:42:44,988 --> 00:42:46,648
[Mary Beth] Hmm.

762
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:47,755
[Wanda] Hey, hey.

763
00:42:48,758 --> 00:42:49,791
I got your camera.

764
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,920
Oh, you got your first
photo shoot today, huh?

765
00:42:52,962 --> 00:42:54,889
[laughs]

766
00:42:54,931 --> 00:42:56,958
You go, girl.
I'll see you guys later.

767
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,827
I'm going to go take a walk
and got to get some soup on.

768
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:00,928
- Bye.
- [Wanda] See you later.

769
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:02,730
Have a good time.

770
00:43:02,772 --> 00:43:05,707
[soft music playing]

771
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:08,736
[Mary Beth] Thank you
for letting me do this.

772
00:43:08,778 --> 00:43:11,112
- Of course.
- [Mary Beth] I'm having a wonderful time.

773
00:43:12,015 --> 00:43:13,975
You're so easy to photograph.

774
00:43:14,017 --> 00:43:15,710
You're a natural.

775
00:43:15,752 --> 00:43:16,918
Gorgeous!

776
00:43:19,856 --> 00:43:23,284
I'm just going to make some few
adjustments here and then eyes to me.

777
00:43:23,326 --> 00:43:27,388
Now I'd love for you to extend your arm,
so I can see the length of your body.

778
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:29,063
Yeah, beautiful.

779
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:32,026
Now, if you...

780
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:34,228
if you don't mind I'd like to go
over here to the stool,

781
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:36,397
so I can get the sunlight on your
face coming in through the windows.

782
00:43:36,439 --> 00:43:38,032
- Okay.
- Okay.

783
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:40,742
- Great! So, follow me.
- [inaudible]

784
00:43:43,747 --> 00:43:45,046
[Mary Beth] Beautiful!

785
00:43:46,182 --> 00:43:47,281
I like that.

786
00:43:48,384 --> 00:43:49,984
I love that expression.

787
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:54,615
Yes!

788
00:43:54,657 --> 00:43:55,890
That's lovely, Laura.
Really nice.

789
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:02,223
Beautiful... Oh!

790
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:04,826
Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

791
00:44:04,868 --> 00:44:06,260
I can't find my lucky ladle.

792
00:44:06,302 --> 00:44:08,396
I think I probably left
it in here somewhere.

793
00:44:08,438 --> 00:44:10,865
[inaudible] this drawer.

794
00:44:10,907 --> 00:44:12,900
I'm not interrupting, am I?

795
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:14,969
We were just finishing.

796
00:44:15,011 --> 00:44:17,071
Oh.

797
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:19,006
You know, I probably already packed
it up in the RV and just forgot.

798
00:44:19,048 --> 00:44:20,414
You know how that goes.

799
00:44:22,986 --> 00:44:23,951
Nice robe.

800
00:44:27,323 --> 00:44:29,484
The photos will be gorgeous.
I'll send you copies.

801
00:44:29,526 --> 00:44:31,085
I'm sorry.

802
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:32,894
Thank you for letting
me photograph you.

803
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:44,999
What was that all about?
You spying on me?

804
00:44:45,041 --> 00:44:46,868
No.

805
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:49,544
No, of course not.
I was just curious.

806
00:44:51,114 --> 00:44:52,406
I've never seen
a fashion shoot before.

807
00:44:52,448 --> 00:44:54,942
Oh, this isn't Paris.

808
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:58,913
I was just getting some pics for the
photo contest, you convinced me to enter.

809
00:44:58,955 --> 00:45:00,448
Oh, yeah.

810
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:02,123
Laura, what a beauty, huh?

811
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:04,592
I bet those shots are damn good.

812
00:45:06,062 --> 00:45:08,189
Did you get
any of the naked ones?

813
00:45:08,231 --> 00:45:12,093
Are you a 12-year-old boy?
No, I didn't get any naked pics.

814
00:45:12,135 --> 00:45:14,462
Oh, come on, I'm tired.

815
00:45:14,504 --> 00:45:16,470
And I'll bet you do snore.

816
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,873
Why would you say that?

817
00:45:25,915 --> 00:45:27,048
Hi.

818
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:32,914
I, uh...

819
00:45:32,956 --> 00:45:36,017
I hope your few days with us opened up
your heart and mind to possibilities.

820
00:45:36,059 --> 00:45:38,993
Definitely.
It definitely did.

821
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:41,589
Yeah.

822
00:45:41,631 --> 00:45:43,364
Come back again
and stay a while.

823
00:45:44,934 --> 00:45:46,360
Oh, hey!

824
00:45:46,402 --> 00:45:48,930
Sorry about that whole
meditation thing.

825
00:45:48,972 --> 00:45:50,164
No Om for me.

826
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:51,899
[laughs]

827
00:45:51,941 --> 00:45:54,902
I'm not making fun of it.
I, you know, I just...

828
00:45:54,944 --> 00:45:56,537
How do you sit still like that?

829
00:45:56,579 --> 00:45:59,040
I like it. It helps me.

830
00:45:59,082 --> 00:46:01,215
You helped me, Daiku too.

831
00:46:02,452 --> 00:46:03,451
Well...

832
00:46:05,555 --> 00:46:06,914
I couldn't.

833
00:46:06,956 --> 00:46:08,182
- It should be with you.
- Really.

834
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:09,423
Mm-mm.
No, it should be with you.

835
00:46:10,593 --> 00:46:11,893
Just be.

836
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:15,122
Remember, just...

837
00:46:15,164 --> 00:46:16,163
just be.

838
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,526
Hey,

839
00:46:18,568 --> 00:46:21,128
while you're just being,
how about a parting gift?

840
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:23,898
This is Wanda's new famous
Clementine spice soup.

841
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,968
I know it sounds weird
but trust.

842
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:28,042
Wow!

843
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,006
Bye.

844
00:46:32,048 --> 00:46:35,516
[mellow music playing]

845
00:46:47,297 --> 00:46:48,562
Hey, did you just love it?

846
00:46:49,999 --> 00:46:51,399
How about that Laura, huh?

847
00:46:53,236 --> 00:46:55,236
Yes, and yes.

848
00:46:58,007 --> 00:47:01,242
And how about Daiku?
What a cool guy that is, right?

849
00:47:02,078 --> 00:47:04,478
He's like the Dalai Lama,
but with cooler clothes.

850
00:47:05,715 --> 00:47:07,415
Way cool guy.

851
00:47:11,354 --> 00:47:14,221
You know what? I didn't mean
for any of this to make you sad.

852
00:47:16,359 --> 00:47:17,325
Oh!

853
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:21,429
I'm not sad at all, Wanda.

854
00:47:24,267 --> 00:47:25,633
For the first time in...

855
00:47:27,503 --> 00:47:29,337
a very long time...

856
00:47:30,606 --> 00:47:31,672
I feel like me.

857
00:47:33,543 --> 00:47:37,712
Not me as someone
living in someone else's life.

858
00:47:39,415 --> 00:47:42,283
Just me.

859
00:47:45,421 --> 00:47:46,554
So sad...

860
00:47:48,291 --> 00:47:49,383
[chuckles]

861
00:47:49,425 --> 00:47:50,658
...absolutely not.

862
00:47:51,728 --> 00:47:53,194
[chuckles]

863
00:47:55,198 --> 00:47:56,991
How about I fix you
a cup of tea?

864
00:47:57,033 --> 00:47:58,332
I have the water on already.

865
00:48:00,269 --> 00:48:03,304
You know,
I got your little teapot back here.

866
00:48:05,608 --> 00:48:09,704
This is your lucky pot, huh? I mean,
who travels with a teapot. It's hot.

867
00:48:09,746 --> 00:48:13,574
Yeah, it's a long story. It's a long
story but I'll share it with you sometime.

868
00:48:13,616 --> 00:48:17,478
Let's just say that the teapot
is from one journey

869
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,482
and we have started a new one.

870
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:23,651
- Cheers, my friend!
- Cheers!

871
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:25,119
[laughs]

872
00:48:25,161 --> 00:48:26,694
To you, to you, Wanda.
Thank you.

873
00:48:28,164 --> 00:48:30,358
[Wanda]
I think we need to go camp.

874
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,694
Camp out under the stars,
find the quiet.

875
00:48:33,736 --> 00:48:35,730
Although, the woods are never
really that quiet,

876
00:48:35,772 --> 00:48:38,265
- you know, mountain lions and bears and such.
- Sleep outside?

877
00:48:38,307 --> 00:48:42,169
Yeah, that's the beauty of it.
Surrounded by nature.

878
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:44,372
We'll head up north for a few
days and sleep in this baby.

879
00:48:44,414 --> 00:48:46,607
I got a great camping
spot up there.

880
00:48:46,649 --> 00:48:49,176
I was thinking maybe we could
rent a cabin in the woods

881
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:51,345
with running water
and a bathroom,

882
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:56,450
and then sit on the porch,
and take in all that nature.

883
00:48:56,492 --> 00:48:58,519
Be brave, girl scout.

884
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:01,522
Wanda will protect you from all
the scary creatures in the forest.

885
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:04,759
Well, I haven't been camping since
I was a kid and I didn't like it.

886
00:49:04,801 --> 00:49:07,435
Well, you'll like it now.

887
00:49:08,271 --> 00:49:09,797
Okay. Okay. Okay.

888
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:13,067
Yes, yes, absolutely. Yes, yes!

889
00:49:13,109 --> 00:49:14,368
Whoo. Yes!

890
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:16,337
Wait,
did you say mountain lions?

891
00:49:16,379 --> 00:49:18,639
I did. I also said bears.

892
00:49:18,681 --> 00:49:20,508
Wanda, Wanda,
what are you getting...

893
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:23,384
Mountain lions and bears...
Oh, yes, I'm on the journey.

894
00:49:24,554 --> 00:49:28,222
[mellow music playing]

895
00:49:49,245 --> 00:49:51,579
[music stops playing]

896
00:49:55,718 --> 00:49:57,218
[cellphone rings]

897
00:49:58,721 --> 00:50:00,247
Finally.

898
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:01,649
[Mary Beth's mom]
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

899
00:50:01,691 --> 00:50:03,851
Yes, yes.
Mom, you and Kevin hanging in?

900
00:50:03,893 --> 00:50:05,319
<i>Where are you?</i>

901
00:50:05,361 --> 00:50:07,721
Wanda and I are camping?

902
00:50:07,763 --> 00:50:12,193
<i>Wanda does know that roughing it for
you is the Holiday Inn, doesn't she?</i>

903
00:50:12,235 --> 00:50:17,131
<i>You couldn't even stand summer camp with
creepy crawlies and owls in the night.</i>

904
00:50:17,173 --> 00:50:19,400
I'm excited about this, mom.

905
00:50:19,442 --> 00:50:24,138
Sleeping under the stars, skinny dipping
in the lake, telling ghost stories.

906
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,307
- <i>Oh, my God!</i>
- What, what, what's the matter?

907
00:50:26,349 --> 00:50:27,848
<i>You've become 12 again.</i>

908
00:50:28,784 --> 00:50:30,144
Is Kevin around?

909
00:50:30,186 --> 00:50:31,712
<i>He's in his gym.</i>

910
00:50:31,754 --> 00:50:34,148
<i>If you can call tonight
he'll be around.</i>

911
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:35,716
Any good news about the virus?

912
00:50:35,758 --> 00:50:37,885
<i>It is far from blowing away.</i>

913
00:50:37,927 --> 00:50:40,928
<i>You know, people just don't take
precautions and all of us suffer.</i>

914
00:50:41,764 --> 00:50:46,160
<i>Why on earth you'd want to be out in the
world ripe with disease, I'll never know.</i>

915
00:50:46,202 --> 00:50:49,463
I'm in the middle of the woods.
No one else is around.

916
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:53,267
I'm probably in one of the
safest places in America.

917
00:50:53,309 --> 00:50:57,438
Hey, mom, I've got to go before Wanda
hurts herself putting this tent up.

918
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,807
<i>Have fun. Stay safe.</i>

919
00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:01,315
Bye.

920
00:51:03,886 --> 00:51:05,513
How can I help?

921
00:51:05,555 --> 00:51:06,680
Oh!

922
00:51:06,722 --> 00:51:08,355
Hey, you can blow this up.

923
00:51:09,325 --> 00:51:10,457
Okay, on it.

924
00:51:20,203 --> 00:51:22,670
By the way, love this place.

925
00:51:24,507 --> 00:51:26,500
[utensils clatter]

926
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:27,608
I'm okay.

927
00:51:33,783 --> 00:51:35,783
You keep outdoing yourself here.

928
00:51:40,923 --> 00:51:43,584
I don't feel like
I'm making any progress.

929
00:51:43,626 --> 00:51:44,919
Want to use this?

930
00:51:44,961 --> 00:51:46,554
You have a pump?

931
00:51:46,596 --> 00:51:48,495
Yeah, I'm going to die.
I'm so dizzy.

932
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:51,525
Here, I'll do it.

933
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:52,726
- Go sit.
- All right.

934
00:51:52,768 --> 00:51:53,928
Go sit down.

935
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:56,270
[laughs]

936
00:52:05,548 --> 00:52:06,914
I wonder who lives there.

937
00:52:08,017 --> 00:52:10,277
That's another little surprise
I have for you.

938
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:11,545
Surprise?

939
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:15,583
I'll introduce you once I
get all this stuff set up.

940
00:52:15,625 --> 00:52:16,517
To whom?

941
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:17,558
You'll see.

942
00:52:29,338 --> 00:52:31,799
[laughs]

943
00:52:31,841 --> 00:52:33,634
Oh, you're here.

944
00:52:33,676 --> 00:52:35,836
Did you get everything set up?

945
00:52:35,878 --> 00:52:38,739
[Wanda]
We did. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

946
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:42,543
I brought you my newest
creation, Clementine spice soup.

947
00:52:42,585 --> 00:52:44,011
Oh...

948
00:52:44,053 --> 00:52:47,348
Davina, this is my friend
Mary Beth Higgins.

949
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:50,618
- Mary Beth, this is Davina.
- I know you.

950
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:53,020
You're Davina Moonbeam.

951
00:52:53,062 --> 00:52:55,996
I was at one of your events
in San Diego a few years back.

952
00:52:56,966 --> 00:52:58,432
Well, I know.

953
00:52:59,835 --> 00:53:01,295
I really don't.

954
00:53:01,337 --> 00:53:02,930
[both laugh]

955
00:53:02,972 --> 00:53:06,433
Everyone expects a psychic
to know everything and I don't.

956
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:10,804
Come on in, make yourself to
home, we hug here.

957
00:53:10,846 --> 00:53:12,673
Oh, so good to meet you.

958
00:53:12,715 --> 00:53:13,607
Oh!

959
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:15,809
Oh!

960
00:53:15,851 --> 00:53:17,978
- Hi.
- [Davina] This is Karl.

961
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:21,348
Ah, he lives mainly in the trailer,
you probably saw when you drove up.

962
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:23,751
He helps me around the ranch.

963
00:53:23,793 --> 00:53:25,419
I do.

964
00:53:25,461 --> 00:53:27,454
It's a pleasure
to meet you ladies.

965
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:33,033
Oh, this is my longtime-friend
Wanda and her friend Mary Beth.

966
00:53:33,969 --> 00:53:35,596
You, uh... You camping?

967
00:53:35,638 --> 00:53:37,765
Oh, yeah. We sure are.

968
00:53:37,807 --> 00:53:38,799
Really?

969
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:41,335
[all laugh]

970
00:53:41,377 --> 00:53:43,837
Well, I got to go fix some loose boards
out on the bridge and feed my horse Blaze,

971
00:53:43,879 --> 00:53:47,041
but, uh, if you need anything,
you know where to find me.

972
00:53:47,083 --> 00:53:48,876
You guys have a good day.

973
00:53:48,918 --> 00:53:49,977
Bye, Karl.

974
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:51,585
- [Karl] Bye.
- Toodles.

975
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:53,947
You are something else.

976
00:53:53,989 --> 00:53:56,583
[laughs]

977
00:53:56,625 --> 00:53:59,426
Well, homemade apple cider.

978
00:54:00,463 --> 00:54:02,389
I don't drink,
Alcohol that is.

979
00:54:02,431 --> 00:54:03,564
So...

980
00:54:04,633 --> 00:54:06,026
Fortune cookies.

981
00:54:06,068 --> 00:54:12,573
You will soon be delivered a tall,
dark, handsome, charming someone.

982
00:54:13,642 --> 00:54:15,102
I think
I must have got your cookie.

983
00:54:15,144 --> 00:54:16,770
[laughs]

984
00:54:16,812 --> 00:54:18,505
Ooh, let me help you.

985
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:19,940
So,

986
00:54:19,982 --> 00:54:23,517
let's use this
to officially welcome you...

987
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:31,819
and offer a wish for a successful
awakening on this part of your journey.

988
00:54:31,861 --> 00:54:33,427
Wanda filled me in a bit.

989
00:54:34,497 --> 00:54:35,422
[clinking]

990
00:54:35,464 --> 00:54:39,460
I can't believe you already know
who Davina is,

991
00:54:39,502 --> 00:54:41,962
and here I was thinking I had
this great surprise for you.

992
00:54:42,004 --> 00:54:44,598
It's a surprise all right.

993
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,733
Are you retired?

994
00:54:45,775 --> 00:54:47,141
From events, yes.

995
00:54:47,977 --> 00:54:50,838
Well, the mind never sleeps,
but until I die.

996
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:52,439
- [Mary Beth] Oh.
- [Davina] Hmm.

997
00:54:52,481 --> 00:54:53,514
Who knows?

998
00:54:54,183 --> 00:54:55,642
Maybe even beyond.

999
00:54:55,684 --> 00:54:58,652
I'll still see things,
know things.

1000
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:03,384
It's the gift
that keeps on giving.

1001
00:55:03,426 --> 00:55:05,619
[laughs]

1002
00:55:05,661 --> 00:55:08,629
And it's the gift
that I want to give to you.

1003
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,526
What?

1004
00:55:12,568 --> 00:55:18,399
I came here purposely because I know that Davina
can help you figure out where you're going,

1005
00:55:18,441 --> 00:55:20,040
you know, what's next.

1006
00:55:20,876 --> 00:55:22,075
Oh, I...

1007
00:55:23,078 --> 00:55:24,478
I don't know.

1008
00:55:25,181 --> 00:55:27,114
Who really wants
to know the future?

1009
00:55:28,818 --> 00:55:30,043
[both] Everyone!

1010
00:55:30,085 --> 00:55:31,845
[Davina laughs]

1011
00:55:31,887 --> 00:55:34,415
[Wanda] So, come on, Mary Beth.

1012
00:55:34,457 --> 00:55:35,789
You've got nothing to lose.

1013
00:55:36,659 --> 00:55:38,152
Just be open.

1014
00:55:38,194 --> 00:55:39,787
I'm going to wait outside.

1015
00:55:39,829 --> 00:55:42,756
[Davina laughs]

1016
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:44,198
Leave you two alone.

1017
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:48,769
[door closes]

1018
00:55:49,705 --> 00:55:50,697
[chuckles]

1019
00:55:50,739 --> 00:55:53,941
[tranquil music playing]

1020
00:55:59,482 --> 00:56:05,586
You are at the crossroads
in your life, more like a big X.

1021
00:56:06,856 --> 00:56:09,223
So many choices. Which...

1022
00:56:10,493 --> 00:56:14,127
path to take
is constantly on your mind.

1023
00:56:15,865 --> 00:56:21,635
Something happened to awaken your
desire to figure out your life.

1024
00:56:23,205 --> 00:56:24,498
[Mary Beth] <i>No kidding.</i>

1025
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:28,709
<i>Plus, I'm sure Wanda told
you all about our journey.</i>

1026
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:35,716
I was told nothing personal
about you.

1027
00:56:37,553 --> 00:56:41,054
Everything I see or hear
is new to me.

1028
00:56:45,094 --> 00:56:48,695
[chuckles]
Your son... You have a son.

1029
00:56:49,565 --> 00:56:51,265
Oh, young, smart...

1030
00:56:52,668 --> 00:56:53,834
he will keep well.

1031
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:57,237
You worry about him
now more than ever.

1032
00:56:58,073 --> 00:57:01,008
I...
I see him leaving with...

1033
00:57:02,745 --> 00:57:07,641
a relative to go stay with them
while you're on your quest.

1034
00:57:07,683 --> 00:57:10,217
A quest! Yes.

1035
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:13,153
That's what this is...

1036
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:16,623
but you don't know
what you want yet.

1037
00:57:19,028 --> 00:57:20,654
Oh.

1038
00:57:20,696 --> 00:57:23,764
I see a... a separation.

1039
00:57:24,767 --> 00:57:27,060
Oh, a permanent separation.

1040
00:57:27,102 --> 00:57:29,636
[sobs]

1041
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:33,106
It will be...

1042
00:57:34,176 --> 00:57:35,836
[sighs]

1043
00:57:35,878 --> 00:57:39,106
it will be easier
for both you and your partner...

1044
00:57:39,148 --> 00:57:40,180
No...

1045
00:57:41,216 --> 00:57:42,282
your husband.

1046
00:57:43,719 --> 00:57:45,052
He wants this as well.

1047
00:57:48,691 --> 00:57:50,958
I... I see a book.

1048
00:57:52,995 --> 00:57:55,055
A book on a table.

1049
00:57:55,097 --> 00:58:00,067
Inside are your words and your
photos from this time in your life.

1050
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:04,271
Oh, you have much talent,
creative talent.

1051
00:58:06,375 --> 00:58:08,709
Your time to show the world
has arrived.

1052
00:58:10,346 --> 00:58:11,345
[Mary Beth] <i>A book?</i>

1053
00:58:12,848 --> 00:58:13,981
<i>My photos?</i>

1054
00:58:14,917 --> 00:58:16,683
[laughs]

1055
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:20,621
Oh!

1056
00:58:23,993 --> 00:58:25,726
I see a new love in your life.

1057
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:31,164
Someone you know
or have known a long time.

You will know who...

when you are ready
to let this someone...

It's...

1068
00:59:06,935 --> 00:59:09,630
My minutes could be your hours,
my days your months.

I am here in the now as you are.

1070
00:59:16,111 --> 00:59:17,277
You need to open up.

1071

is not easy.

Don't hold back...

1104
01:02:49,291 --> 01:02:51,157
Was Davina's reading upsetting?

1105
01:02:53,595 --> 01:02:57,063
I know that things in my life
are coming to an end...

1106
01:02:59,968 --> 01:03:01,167

- Tell? No.

No. Not at all, Zero. I swear.

1111
01:03:18,654 --> 01:03:20,247
What'd she say?

1112
01:03:20,289 --> 01:03:22,883
It wasn't
what Davina said, it's...

1113
01:03:22,925 --> 01:03:26,219
She made me realize
that change is coming.

1114
01:03:26,261 --> 01:03:27,661
It's going to be hard...

1115
01:03:29,698 --> 01:03:34,067
but eventually it'll be good,
in the end.

1116
01:03:35,137 --> 01:03:37,570
Well, that's good, right?
That's the right attitude.

This is all I ask the universe.

1120

Just once,
I'd like to feel like...

1121
01:03:55,624 --> 01:03:58,959
like I'm first or equal.

1122
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:05,458
I want to feel that passion

Absolutely not.

I need this time with you.

Are you hungry? We got to eat.

Why don't I get you
a glass of wine?

Wine.

1136

Yes, it is.

You want some coffee?

1156
01:06:17,132 --> 01:06:18,558
Cream or sugar?

1157
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,567
Oh, relax, black is fine.

1158
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:25,205
This looks wonderful.
I'm starving.

1159

Me too.

the air mattress, burned a lot of calories.

I was up really early
this morning...

1163
01:06:39,554 --> 01:06:41,721
and I went, um, scouting
out the place.

1164
01:06:42,757 --> 01:06:45,692
Some really,
really beautiful things to see.

1165
01:06:47,329 --> 01:06:48,795
You want to go exploring today?

1166
01:06:49,698 --> 01:06:52,165
- Do you... do you hike?
- I do.

You're a really good snuggler.

1169
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:12,919
I was, uh...

1170
01:07:14,856 --> 01:07:16,789
protecting you
from the mountain lions.

1171
01:07:17,759 --> 01:07:18,791
That's all.

1172
01:07:23,365 --> 01:07:24,774
Yeah.

1173
01:07:24,816 --> 01:07:26,226
Well, I can report
that I was not attacked.

1174
01:07:26,268 --> 01:07:27,233
So, good job.

1175
01:07:29,504 --> 01:07:34,807
So a hike would be great and
a shower afterwards, I guess?

1176
01:07:35,644 --> 01:07:37,871
Is there a shower?

1177
01:07:37,913 --> 01:07:40,273
No.

1178
01:07:40,315 --> 01:07:43,810
I usually just take a couple of buckets
of water and pour it over myself.

1179
01:07:43,852 --> 01:07:44,918
It works.

1180

I'll get my shoes...

01:10:50,071 --> 01:10:52,672
faithful to Bill
from the day we were married.

1234
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:56,509
Now, our only connection
is Kevin, of course.

1235
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:01,447
Free to choose whatever
and whoever I want...

1236
01:11:03,017 --> 01:11:04,150
and I'm scared of both.

1237
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:06,619
Make sense?

1238
01:11:08,857 --> 01:11:12,819
So tell me about this one and only
woman experience that you had.

1239
01:11:12,861 --> 01:11:14,921
Was it one of those
college things?

1240
01:11:14,963 --> 01:11:15,928
Right after.

1241
01:11:17,599 --> 01:11:19,392
I was...

1242
01:11:19,434 --> 01:11:22,462
It my first
professional photoshoot.

1243
01:11:22,504 --> 01:11:23,396
[sighs]

1244
01:11:23,438 --> 01:11:24,597
What a coup!

1245
01:11:24,639 --> 01:11:25,665
[Wanda laughs]

1246
01:11:25,707 --> 01:11:27,467
I was all of 20 or so and...

1247
01:11:27,509 --> 01:11:33,406
and I got to go to London,
and shoot this beautiful model in London.

1248
01:11:33,448 --> 01:11:36,476
Had tea on the River Thames,

1249
01:11:36,518 --> 01:11:40,580
very romantic,
hence, the teapot.

1250
01:11:40,622 --> 01:11:43,816
Oh, see, I knew there had to be
some special meaning there.

1251
01:11:43,858 --> 01:11:46,753
I mean who brings
a ceramic teapot on a road trip?

1252
01:11:46,795 --> 01:11:49,929
We met on that photoshoot,
the model.

1253
01:11:50,899 --> 01:11:52,458
The model?

1254
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,527
[laughs]

1255
01:11:54,569 --> 01:11:57,597
- I fell in love.
- Hmm.

1256
01:11:57,639 --> 01:12:00,066
That lose your breath
kind of love.

1257
01:12:00,108 --> 01:12:01,140
Oh.

1258
01:12:02,544 --> 01:12:05,211
She was beautiful...

1259
01:12:06,915 --> 01:12:09,649
sexy, funny.

1260
01:12:11,486 --> 01:12:13,786
I was absolutely lost in her...

1261
01:12:14,823 --> 01:12:15,782
for a month.

1262
01:12:15,824 --> 01:12:16,889
Just a month?

1263
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:20,686
Then?

1264
01:12:20,728 --> 01:12:22,522
Bill...

1265
01:12:22,564 --> 01:12:23,796
my parents...

1266
01:12:25,033 --> 01:12:26,032
my fears.

1267
01:12:29,537 --> 01:12:30,636
I've felt that way...

1268
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:33,933
in a small way.

1269
01:12:33,975 --> 01:12:35,908
But, you know,
like you, I wanted more.

1270
01:12:39,781 --> 01:12:43,783
Having my life be my life
for the first time in forever...

1271
01:12:44,786 --> 01:12:45,818
feels good.

1272
01:12:49,924 --> 01:12:51,918
You okay hanging out with me?

1273
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:54,053
I love hanging out with you.

1274
01:12:54,095 --> 01:12:55,655
You're...

1275
01:12:55,697 --> 01:12:59,826
You're funny and curious
and a little crazy.

1276
01:12:59,868 --> 01:13:02,462
[both laugh]

1277
01:13:02,504 --> 01:13:03,669
We're good.

1278
01:13:04,973 --> 01:13:06,032
We're very good.

1279
01:13:06,074 --> 01:13:09,275
[mellow music playing]

1280
01:13:20,121 --> 01:13:21,848
[Wanda]
You've never had s'mores?

1281
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:22,915
[Mary Beth]
I'm sheltered.

1282
01:13:22,957 --> 01:13:24,817
Okay. So

1283
01:13:24,859 --> 01:13:27,653
- it's time for you to have your first s'more.
- Ooh.

1284
01:13:27,695 --> 01:13:29,689
Now, I'll build a fire and we're going
to get everything all hot and gooey,

1285
01:13:29,731 --> 01:13:31,824
but first I want to introduce
you to the ingredients.

1286
01:13:31,866 --> 01:13:34,527
You got your trio
of ingredients here.

1287
01:13:34,569 --> 01:13:36,496
You've got your chocolate.

1288
01:13:36,538 --> 01:13:38,664
Then you got your graham
crackers and then marshmallows.

1289
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:40,600
I usually have cookies
on a skewer

1290
01:13:40,642 --> 01:13:42,909
and get them really burnt,
and gooey, but the...

1291
01:13:44,812 --> 01:13:46,312
That's my favorite ingredient.

1292
01:14:00,194 --> 01:14:02,187
Whoa!

1293
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:04,263
- Was that a good sign or what?
- Incredible!

1294
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:08,094
You know, I ordered that
up just for you.

1295
01:14:08,136 --> 01:14:09,929
Knowing you, I believe it.

1296
01:14:09,971 --> 01:14:11,664
[laughs]

1297
01:14:11,706 --> 01:14:13,573
Ah, that was amazing!

1298
01:14:14,342 --> 01:14:16,602
Here, can I have some of that?
I'll trade you...

1299
01:14:16,644 --> 01:14:18,204
- Yeah, give me that.
- ...the chocolate

1300
01:14:18,246 --> 01:14:20,039
- for the marshmallow.
- You know what? You know what?

1301
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:21,908
I don't even need
to melt it anymore.

1302
01:14:21,950 --> 01:14:23,249
[laughs]

1303
01:14:39,133 --> 01:14:40,793
You're good.

1304
01:14:40,835 --> 01:14:41,867
Good subject.

1305
01:14:47,041 --> 01:14:48,868
Shit! I...
I shouldn't have done that.

1306
01:14:48,910 --> 01:14:51,637
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
I should not have done that.

1307
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:52,745
[animal growls]

1308
01:14:54,082 --> 01:14:55,114
What's that?

1309
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:59,151
My God!

1310
01:15:00,388 --> 01:15:01,814
[gasps]

1311
01:15:01,856 --> 01:15:03,049
That sounds really big.

1312
01:15:03,091 --> 01:15:04,650
It sounds like
something's coming.

1313
01:15:04,692 --> 01:15:06,025
[both speaking indistinctly]

1314
01:15:09,964 --> 01:15:12,792
[cackles]

1315
01:15:12,834 --> 01:15:14,226
Oh, my God, Davina!
You're gonna kill me.

1316
01:15:14,268 --> 01:15:18,264
I thought you might like to come up to
the house for some homemade apple pie

1317
01:15:18,306 --> 01:15:22,768
and a cup of cocoa before you...
Oh, were you sleeping?

1318
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:24,971
Did I wake you up? I'm sorry.

1319
01:15:25,013 --> 01:15:26,906
No, no. We're just

1320
01:15:26,948 --> 01:15:30,176
relaxing,
listening to wild animal sounds.

1321
01:15:30,218 --> 01:15:32,612
- What time is it?
- Nine o'clock.

1322
01:15:32,654 --> 01:15:35,681
I would love apple pie
and hot cocoa.

1323
01:15:35,723 --> 01:15:38,824
- We'll be there.
- Let's go.

1324
01:15:49,937 --> 01:15:51,263
- [animal growls]
- [both gasp]

1325
01:15:51,305 --> 01:15:52,898
Oh, good!
You got here before Gus got you.

1326
01:15:52,940 --> 01:15:55,067
- Gus?
- The mountain lion.

1327
01:15:55,109 --> 01:15:56,402
Oh, my God! You named him.

1328
01:15:56,444 --> 01:15:58,671
[Davina laughs]

1329
01:15:58,713 --> 01:16:02,008
Cougar, whatever you want to call him.
He's been here for years.

1330
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:04,143
I don't bother him,
he doesn't bother me.

1331
01:16:04,185 --> 01:16:05,277
[Davina laughs]

1332
01:16:05,319 --> 01:16:11,223
Oh, you girls remembered to zip up
your tent and lock up your food, right?

1333
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:14,854
Thanks for the heads up, Davina.

1334
01:16:14,896 --> 01:16:16,188
Not exactly.

1335
01:16:16,230 --> 01:16:18,057
[laughs]
Oops!

1336
01:16:18,099 --> 01:16:18,991
[cellphone rings]

1337
01:16:19,033 --> 01:16:20,433
Sorry, ladies.

1338
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:23,996
It's my mom. I have to take it.

1339
01:16:24,038 --> 01:16:25,438
Oh, please.

1340
01:16:30,411 --> 01:16:32,772
Is everything okay?
Did something happen?

1341
01:16:32,814 --> 01:16:34,874
[Mary Beth's mother]
<i>No, no, nothing happened.</i>

1342
01:16:34,916 --> 01:16:37,677
<i>I just wanted to let you know
I'm going to head home tomorrow.</i>

1343
01:16:37,719 --> 01:16:40,012
<i>Kevin's going to come with me.</i>

1344
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:43,049
<i>He can do his remote school stuff
from my house and I get to go home.</i>

1345
01:16:43,091 --> 01:16:45,951
Well, I'll be home in a week.
Are you sure?

1346
01:16:45,993 --> 01:16:47,420
<i>I need my own space.</i>

1347
01:16:47,462 --> 01:16:49,355
<i>I can get my pooch
out of the kennel.</i>

1348
01:16:49,397 --> 01:16:51,824
<i>I hope she talks to me again</i>

1349
01:16:51,866 --> 01:16:54,894
<i>and Kevin could use a vacation after
all these months. I have a pool.</i>

1350
01:16:54,936 --> 01:16:57,263
Okay, I understand.

1351
01:16:57,305 --> 01:16:59,865
Just make sure you lock up
the house before you leave.

1352
01:16:59,907 --> 01:17:03,302
<i>I thought I'd leave the front door wide
open and put up a welcome thief sign.</i>

1353
01:17:03,344 --> 01:17:04,303
Mom.

1354
01:17:04,345 --> 01:17:07,973
Anyway, thanks for taking care
of my boy.

1355
01:17:08,015 --> 01:17:10,309
I'll come pick him up
as soon as I get home.

1356
01:17:10,351 --> 01:17:14,453
<i>I'm actually loving having him to
myself, you know, I get lonely too.</i>

1357
01:17:17,291 --> 01:17:19,285
As a matter of fact,

1358
01:17:19,327 --> 01:17:22,455
one of the things that I'm
learning from all this is that

1359
01:17:22,497 --> 01:17:25,264
we need to be around the people
we love so much more.

1360
01:17:26,501 --> 01:17:29,795
Let's make you and us
a priority from now on.

1361
01:17:29,837 --> 01:17:33,833
<i>Sounds like this trip and your
friend have been good for you.</i>

1362
01:17:33,875 --> 01:17:36,108
Yes, both.

1363
01:17:38,246 --> 01:17:42,108
Well, you two have fun
and, uh, I'll call you soon.

1364
01:17:42,150 --> 01:17:46,452
And... Hey, ma, if I haven't told
you lately that I love you, uh...

1365
01:17:47,822 --> 01:17:48,788
I do.

1366
01:17:51,425 --> 01:17:52,418
[speaking indistinctly]

1367
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:54,059
[both laugh]

1368
01:17:55,396 --> 01:17:57,123
Everything okay?

1369
01:17:57,165 --> 01:17:59,492
Oh, yeah, mom and Kevin are
heading to her house.

1370
01:17:59,534 --> 01:18:02,161
She's anxious to get back
and it's fine.

1371
01:18:02,203 --> 01:18:03,929
Really, it's... it's okay.

1372
01:18:03,971 --> 01:18:05,431
Oh, well, how about a warm up,
huh?

1373
01:18:05,473 --> 01:18:07,106
Oh, no. No, thank you.

1374
01:18:10,077 --> 01:18:12,204
Oh, boy!

1375
01:18:12,246 --> 01:18:14,006
This doesn't happen to me
very often.

1376
01:18:14,048 --> 01:18:15,341
What? What is it?

1377
01:18:15,383 --> 01:18:18,277
Well,
I'm having a déjà vu again.

1378
01:18:18,319 --> 01:18:19,845
[sighs]

1379
01:18:19,887 --> 01:18:21,547
I'll share it with you
if you want to hear it.

1380
01:18:21,589 --> 01:18:23,355
Yes.
[chuckles]

1381
01:18:24,926 --> 01:18:26,292
I had a dream last night...

1382
01:18:27,962 --> 01:18:30,322
and Mary Beth you were in it.

1383
01:18:30,364 --> 01:18:31,957
Really?

1384
01:18:31,999 --> 01:18:33,826
[Davina] Yeah,
it wasn't anything terrible,

1385
01:18:33,868 --> 01:18:35,561
but it came
with a word of caution

1386
01:18:35,603 --> 01:18:37,797
and I wanted to share it
with you,

1387
01:18:37,839 --> 01:18:39,298
but I feel like, I might be jumping
into something that I shouldn't.

1388
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:41,133
But you know what?
I'm going to do it anyway.

1389
01:18:41,175 --> 01:18:43,075
Now you got me really curious.

1390
01:18:43,911 --> 01:18:46,512
I know that you two
have gotten...

1391
01:18:47,582 --> 01:18:48,848
close.

1392
01:18:50,117 --> 01:18:51,617
I knew something was coming...

1393
01:18:53,354 --> 01:18:56,188
but now I see
something else coming.

1394
01:18:57,425 --> 01:18:58,557
What?

1395
01:19:00,461 --> 01:19:01,427
History.

1396
01:19:03,431 --> 01:19:05,331
I don't understand.

1397
01:19:06,968 --> 01:19:09,902
I saw you running away,
Mary Beth.

1398
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:13,873
You've done that before.

1399
01:19:14,942 --> 01:19:16,175
The time to stop...

1400
01:19:17,211 --> 01:19:18,544
running away...

1401
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:21,140
is now.

1402
01:19:21,182 --> 01:19:24,944
Now is the time
to run to people,

1403
01:19:24,986 --> 01:19:28,053
places,
things with your eyes open...

1404
01:19:29,423 --> 01:19:31,023
and your heart open.

1405
01:19:33,261 --> 01:19:36,428
What... I have... I have
to go back to the tent now.

1406
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:40,566
[door closes]

1407
01:19:42,670 --> 01:19:44,003
I better go.

1408
01:19:48,142 --> 01:19:49,441
Hey, hey.

1409
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:53,579
Love is there.

1410
01:19:55,349 --> 01:19:56,575
Love is there.

1411
01:19:56,617 --> 01:20:00,185
[mellow music playing]

1412
01:20:17,571 --> 01:20:19,071
What happened?

1413
01:20:20,708 --> 01:20:22,174
She knows.

1414
01:20:23,945 --> 01:20:25,377
She knows that I...

1415
01:20:26,447 --> 01:20:28,314
I ran away from Barbara.

1416
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:30,282
[sighs]

1417
01:20:31,419 --> 01:20:33,452
That's what I do
when I'm scared.

1418
01:20:34,689 --> 01:20:35,721
I run.

1419
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,192
I don't want to.

1420
01:20:42,997 --> 01:20:44,396
I don't plan to.

1421
01:20:45,566 --> 01:20:49,335
[mellow music playing]

1422
01:20:59,380 --> 01:21:01,246
I don't want to hurt anyone.

1423
01:21:29,610 --> 01:21:30,776
Deep thoughts?

1424
01:21:34,515 --> 01:21:36,141
Hey, it's Wanda.

1425
01:21:36,183 --> 01:21:37,683
- How deep can they be?
- Don't, don't, don't.

1426
01:21:39,086 --> 01:21:40,319
Remember, it's me.

1427
01:21:43,057 --> 01:21:44,023
Yeah.

1428
01:21:47,661 --> 01:21:49,762
It's just that
I have been thinking.

1429
01:21:52,566 --> 01:21:54,033
You know, thinking a lot.

1430
01:21:55,636 --> 01:21:56,802
Maybe too much...

1431
01:21:59,373 --> 01:22:01,066
about her.

1432
01:22:01,108 --> 01:22:02,067
About...

1433
01:22:02,109 --> 01:22:05,110
- Her...
- Her. Oh...

1434
01:22:07,615 --> 01:22:12,351
You went on this trip, this
journey, to open up her world.

1435
01:22:13,354 --> 01:22:14,420
My dear friend...

1436
01:22:15,790 --> 01:22:17,556
she has opened yours.

1437
01:22:19,727 --> 01:22:21,660
When we were
in the meditation gardens...

1438
01:22:22,563 --> 01:22:24,596
I just saw this light
come over her.

1439
01:22:27,201 --> 01:22:29,128
There's this woman there,
Laura who

1440
01:22:29,170 --> 01:22:31,764
gave her a statue of the green
Tara, do you know it?

1441
01:22:31,806 --> 01:22:33,499
Oh, I do.

1442
01:22:33,541 --> 01:22:35,140
A powerful force.

1443
01:22:36,510 --> 01:22:40,272
The Great Protectress,
compassionate force,

1444
01:22:40,314 --> 01:22:42,541
who fuels all life,

1445
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:44,850
addresses all your fears.

1446
01:22:46,487 --> 01:22:48,220
I'm afraid, Davina.

1447
01:22:49,090 --> 01:22:50,255
[sobs]

1448
01:22:51,492 --> 01:22:52,825
I'm afraid.

1449
01:22:57,198 --> 01:22:59,364
I am afraid.
I've already let her in.

1450
01:23:01,268 --> 01:23:04,169
And then we'll go home and this
trip will end, and I'll just...

1451
01:23:06,607 --> 01:23:11,243
Oh, I've misread all the queues
and I'll just be alone again.

1452
01:23:13,547 --> 01:23:16,642
You've only known her
a few months

1453
01:23:16,684 --> 01:23:19,211
and how long have you been
on this trip?

1454
01:23:19,253 --> 01:23:21,280
What? A week?

1455
01:23:21,322 --> 01:23:22,514
[crying]

1456
01:23:22,556 --> 01:23:25,124
I'm not putting
my psychic hat on.

1457
01:23:25,893 --> 01:23:27,453
I'm putting my friend hat on.

1458
01:23:27,495 --> 01:23:28,687
[laughs]

1459
01:23:28,729 --> 01:23:31,597
Just be.

1460
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:35,801
Just sit in the now-ness.

1461
01:23:36,704 --> 01:23:37,870
Oh...

1462
01:23:39,773 --> 01:23:43,609
You're ready to let someone
into your life, fully.

1463
01:23:46,213 --> 01:23:49,481
- It scares you.
- Oh, it does.

1464
01:23:55,589 --> 01:23:58,082
She is on the cusp.

1465
01:23:58,124 --> 01:24:00,619
She is still getting
used to her own aloneness,

1466
01:24:00,661 --> 01:24:02,394
her own fears.

1467
01:24:04,231 --> 01:24:05,564
She runs deeper.

1468
01:24:10,771 --> 01:24:12,304
Let it unfold.

1469
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:14,540
[chuckles softly]

1470
01:24:17,745 --> 01:24:19,344
Just let it unfold.

1471
01:24:28,656 --> 01:24:30,682
You should have waited
so I could help you.

1472
01:24:30,724 --> 01:24:32,691
Oh, it's no problem.

1473
01:24:35,296 --> 01:24:36,254
Did you have a nice walk?

1474
01:24:36,296 --> 01:24:37,256
Wanda, I have to say
something and I...

1475
01:24:37,298 --> 01:24:39,431
I need you to listen
to understand.

1476
01:24:40,801 --> 01:24:41,867
Oh.

1477
01:24:42,970 --> 01:24:44,203
Okay.

1478
01:24:45,539 --> 01:24:48,574
When Barbara sent me
that teapot, it was like...

1479
01:24:49,877 --> 01:24:52,811
someone turned the lights on.

1480
01:24:54,682 --> 01:25:00,913
It was a much needed light in the middle
of everyone having to stay in their homes

1481
01:25:00,955 --> 01:25:05,317
and Bill and I splitting up,
time to think.

1482
01:25:05,359 --> 01:25:08,187
Way, way, too much
time to think.

1483
01:25:08,229 --> 01:25:09,922
I think I know
what you're trying to say.

1484
01:25:09,964 --> 01:25:12,324
You need to get home now.
You need a little space from me.

1485
01:25:12,366 --> 01:25:15,267
- You need time for yourself.
- Listen, stop.

1486
01:25:16,704 --> 01:25:20,432
I'm saying that this quest
with you has been like,

1487
01:25:20,474 --> 01:25:24,009
the door slowly opening up
to reveal the light again.

1488
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:27,980
There's just a lot of pieces
in the air and...

1489
01:25:28,983 --> 01:25:31,250
I need to see
how those pieces land.

1490
01:25:32,620 --> 01:25:34,513
It takes time.

1491
01:25:34,555 --> 01:25:36,888
You know, one of the only
things I have is time.

1492
01:25:38,259 --> 01:25:40,959
If you're in my life and you're here
to stay now that's all that matters.

1493
01:25:42,296 --> 01:25:43,528
We are friends.

1494
01:25:44,598 --> 01:25:45,757
It's not going to change.

1495
01:25:45,799 --> 01:25:48,460
[mellow music playing]

1496
01:25:48,502 --> 01:25:49,968
Let's go home.

1497
01:25:51,538 --> 01:25:53,372
Heading home
has a nice ring to it.

1498
01:26:03,717 --> 01:26:05,917
[mellow music]

1499
01:26:31,745 --> 01:26:34,346
Hey, you know,
you didn't say a word all the way home.

1500
01:26:36,383 --> 01:26:37,876
Thinking.

1501
01:26:37,918 --> 01:26:40,912
Listen, I'm going to take
my bags in the bedroom.

1502
01:26:40,954 --> 01:26:44,356
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you need to be home now.

1503
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:46,358
See your kid.

1504
01:26:47,561 --> 01:26:49,027
Sleep in your own bed.

1505
01:26:50,464 --> 01:26:52,331
Sing real loud in the shower.

1506
01:26:54,435 --> 01:26:57,669
I've, uh, never been inside
your house before.

1507
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:00,072
It's warm.

1508
01:27:02,843 --> 01:27:04,736
Spotless.

1509
01:27:04,778 --> 01:27:05,971
That's a relief.

1510
01:27:06,013 --> 01:27:10,642
You know what? I'll go get the surplus
of toilet paper you left in my van.

1511
01:27:10,684 --> 01:27:12,978
Oh, Wanda,
you don't need to do that.

1512
01:27:13,020 --> 01:27:15,380
No, I'm going to go get it because if
I don't, you'll just order more online,

1513
01:27:15,422 --> 01:27:16,982
and I'll have to deliver it
later anyway.

1514
01:27:17,024 --> 01:27:19,524
- Fair enough.
- Get settled.

1515
01:27:25,466 --> 01:27:26,565
Settled.

1516
01:27:27,601 --> 01:27:29,901
Will I ever be settled again?

1517
01:27:30,838 --> 01:27:35,734
Actually, I hope I never settle
again for anything?

1518
01:27:35,776 --> 01:27:40,679
The only thing I want to go
back to is Kevin and now...

1519
01:27:42,583 --> 01:27:44,810
I'm back with your TP.

1520
01:27:44,852 --> 01:27:47,946
I will trade you this TP
for a glass of wine.

1521
01:27:47,988 --> 01:27:50,522
Oh! I'll take that trade.

1522
01:27:55,929 --> 01:27:57,629
Your house is really great.

1523
01:28:00,968 --> 01:28:03,168
[plays music]

1524
01:28:08,142 --> 01:28:10,502
[both laugh]

1525
01:28:10,544 --> 01:28:13,512
- A musician too?
- Oh, like, no.

1526
01:28:14,581 --> 01:28:15,547
Thank you.

1527
01:28:16,483 --> 01:28:17,642
To the journey.

1528
01:28:17,684 --> 01:28:18,917
Yeah.

1529
01:28:19,787 --> 01:28:21,052
Thanks.

1530
01:28:22,723 --> 01:28:24,916
You know,
you just drove eight hours.

1531
01:28:24,958 --> 01:28:27,386
I'm tired.
You have to be exhausted.

1532
01:28:27,428 --> 01:28:28,760
Why don't you stay?

1533
01:28:30,431 --> 01:28:31,523
Stay here?

1534
01:28:31,565 --> 01:28:32,998
Yeah, get some sleep.

1535
01:28:34,635 --> 01:28:37,629
Like a capping it off
with a slumber party?

1536
01:28:37,671 --> 01:28:39,971
Okay. Yes.
[laughs]

1537
01:28:41,508 --> 01:28:45,470
You know, if someone would
have told me a month ago that

1538
01:28:45,512 --> 01:28:48,647
we were going to go on this
grand adventure and...

1539
01:28:49,716 --> 01:28:53,478
and I was going to experience
that gorgeous meditation center

1540
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:55,914
and camp with mountain lions,

1541
01:28:55,956 --> 01:29:00,852
and have a psychic reading,
and watch a shooting star,

1542
01:29:00,894 --> 01:29:04,830
I would have thought
it was the makings of a...

1543
01:29:06,099 --> 01:29:08,099
an epic novel.

1544
01:29:10,771 --> 01:29:15,607
But, Mary Beth,
you are back home again, and, uh...

1545
01:29:16,944 --> 01:29:18,437
I need to talk to Kevin,

1546
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:22,814
assure him that he'll be okay and...
and I'll be okay.

1547
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:28,086
Why me?

1548
01:29:30,491 --> 01:29:31,716
What do you mean?

1549
01:29:31,758 --> 01:29:35,494
Well, you thought about me
and...

1550
01:29:36,497 --> 01:29:40,265
planned this this journey,
and cared for me.

1551
01:29:42,035 --> 01:29:43,795
Why?

1552
01:29:43,837 --> 01:29:45,564
Hmm.

1553
01:29:45,606 --> 01:29:47,772
I know what it's like
to feel lost.

1554
01:29:49,810 --> 01:29:52,110
You know, years ago...

1555
01:29:53,514 --> 01:29:55,680
I met someone
who taught me that life...

1556
01:29:56,817 --> 01:29:58,283
is actually pretty simple.

1557
01:30:00,153 --> 01:30:03,154
It can be quite joyous
if we just let joy be.

1558
01:30:04,758 --> 01:30:07,152
She taught me to stay present,

1559
01:30:07,194 --> 01:30:09,027
be kind, do no harm...

1560
01:30:10,197 --> 01:30:11,656
and to never look back.

1561
01:30:11,698 --> 01:30:12,764
Above all...

1562
01:30:13,667 --> 01:30:14,933
not to look back.

1563
01:30:16,904 --> 01:30:18,970
Plus, I just love
being with you.

1564
01:30:20,307 --> 01:30:22,007
I love being with you too.

1565
01:30:23,844 --> 01:30:28,680
And on that note,
I am going to top us off with some wine.

1566
01:30:31,318 --> 01:30:33,545
It was Davina, wasn't it?

1567
01:30:33,587 --> 01:30:34,586
It was.

1568
01:30:35,923 --> 01:30:37,249
Were you lovers?

1569
01:30:37,291 --> 01:30:40,559
No, she took me in
when I needed taking in.

1570
01:30:42,229 --> 01:30:46,224
Hey, why don't we get into our jammies
and get the slumber party started?

1571
01:30:46,266 --> 01:30:47,926
Oh, Wanda, only you.

1572
01:30:47,968 --> 01:30:49,227
- Jammies?
- Yeah.

1573
01:30:49,269 --> 01:30:50,602
Okay.

1574
01:30:51,271 --> 01:30:52,931
I'm going to get mine
from the RV.

1575
01:30:52,973 --> 01:30:55,567
And I'm going to get
my jammies on.

1576
01:30:55,609 --> 01:30:58,109
- Get your jammies on.
- [laughing] Okay.

1577
01:31:11,325 --> 01:31:13,158
- Hi.
- Hi.
