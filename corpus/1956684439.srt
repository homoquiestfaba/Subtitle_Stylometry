1
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:15,546
(soft electronic music)

2
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,180
- [Man] Suicide's a stupid word.

3
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,103
The root is Latin, to slay oneself.

4
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,183
In French it's suicide,

5
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,260
In Japanese, hari kiri.

6
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,593
Every culture's into it.

7
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:01,280
I started thinking about suicide
when I was six years old.

8
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,800
I stood on my balcony,
balancing over the abyss,

9
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,323
daring myself to take the big leap.

10
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,770
If I hadn't been on a bender
for the previous 36 hours,

11
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,420
if my girlfriend hadn't
dumped me 37 hours ago,

12
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,950
if I hadn't contemplated
it 3011 times before,

13
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,840
I'm sure I wouldn't have found myself

14
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,793
in this desperate situation.

15
00:01:30,187 --> 00:01:34,500
Suicidees never actually
dig a grave and fall in,

16
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,070
they usually leave a bloody mess

17
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,583
for somebody else to clean up.

18
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,440
Me, I wanted to be left

19
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,560
to the crows and maggots of this world,

20
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,010
letting everyone else wonder,

21
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:49,373
whatever happened to
Dickie Bates, the actor?

22
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,213
There are no more auditions.

23
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,350
This is the only part that
was ever really right for me.

24
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,580
I've rehearsed my starring
role many times before,

25
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,760
going so far as to use blanks

26
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,950
to simulate every aspect of the event.

27
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,880
And today is D day,

28
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,573
D as in dead day,

29
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,300
because I had really
committed to this day,

30
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,233
in a big way.

31
00:02:17,249 --> 00:02:19,916
(phone ringing)

32
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,627
(phone ringing)

33
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,853
- Hello Bonnie.

34
00:02:46,744 --> 00:02:48,590
- [Bonnie] Who is this?

35
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,710
- I'm nobody, I just--

36
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,742
- [Bonnie] Wrong number, bye.

37
00:02:51,742 --> 00:02:54,075
(dial tone)

38
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,193
- Whose phone is this?

39
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,730
Hey, is this your phone?

40
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:20,040
- [Dickie Voiceover] And
that's how my day was going,

41
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,920
though really it was a
continuation of the day before,

42
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,990
which in turn re-examined every bad trait

43
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,000
that I had developed

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,283
during my flawed career as a human being.

45
00:03:31,664 --> 00:03:34,331
(phone ringing)

46
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,216
- Hello?

47
00:03:47,216 --> 00:03:48,410
- Hello?

48
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,830
- [Woman] Who is this?

49
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,640
- I found your cell phone.

50
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,110
- It's not mine, it's my stupid husband's.

51
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,940
He claims he dropped it
while he was jogging.

52
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,190
- Well, does he want it back?

53
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,170
- I don't know, let me ask.

54
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,660
Does he want his cell phone back?

55
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,680
- Whoa, wait.

56
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,130
Give me that.

57
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,430
Hello?

58
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,591
- Hey man, what's up?

59
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:09,424
- Where are you?

60
00:04:09,424 --> 00:04:10,790
I'm ecstatic you found my cell phone.

61
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,623
When can I get it back?

62
00:04:11,623 --> 00:04:13,470
- I don't know man, I'm pretty busy today.

63
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,950
Sorry, I'm kind of all over the place.

64
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,510
- Oh, no I'll have my driver
come and get it, Luis.

65
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,130
- You're sending a driver.

66
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:23,130
You know what, my driver just showed up,

67
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,720
and I gotta go.

68
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,260
So I'm not gonna be here any longer.

69
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,040
- No really, it would take five minutes.

70
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,760
There's a big reward for you.

71
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,790
Tell Luis to get back
down to Beechwood Canyon

72
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,620
and get my cell phone, okay run tell him.

73
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,263
- I'm not your personal assistant Bobby.

74
00:04:36,263 --> 00:04:37,096
- What the?

75
00:04:37,096 --> 00:04:37,929
- [Dickie] Sounds like you're a little

76
00:04:37,929 --> 00:04:39,110
wrapped up there Bobby.

77
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,770
Why don't I hold on to your phone for you,

78
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,700
and when you get time
you can give me a call.

79
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,120
- Yeah, I'm having a bad day.

80
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,393
- You know, I'm having
kind of a bad day, too.

81
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,947
Hey, we even have the same phone.

82
00:04:51,947 --> 00:04:54,250
- But my assistant is
out of town this weekend.

83
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,590
There are a lot of people
trying to reach me directly,

84
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:59,640
so it's very, very important
that I get that phone back.

85
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,600
- Why, what do you?

86
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,533
- I'm a producer.

87
00:05:03,497 --> 00:05:05,610
- [Dickie] What are you a real
producer, some big producer,

88
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,110
or one of them fake ones
running around this town?

89
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,473
- I'm Bobby Devillin.

90
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,020
- Yeah right, I'm Cary Grant.

91
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,310
- Okay, great.

92
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,465
What do we do?

93
00:05:14,465 --> 00:05:16,160
(phone ringing)

94
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,993
- You got another call coming in,

95
00:05:16,993 --> 00:05:18,820
you want me to pick that up?

96
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,340
- No, what are you kidding?

97
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,890
- [Dickie] It's Bonnie, I
already talked to her once.

98
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,360
- You answered my phone?

99
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,190
- Yeah, I answered your phone,
I thought you'd be calling,

100
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,980
trying to find your phone.

101
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,630
- Yeah, well actually
that was pretty smart.

102
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,510
Why didn't I think of that?

103
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,120
- I don't know Bob.

104
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,600
You're supposed to be some big legend,

105
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,000
some big producer, some bigshot.

106
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,968
- Okay look, how can
we get this thing done?

107
00:05:36,968 --> 00:05:39,320
- Why don't you cancel your
plans, I'll cancel mine,

108
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,190
you come over and we can
talk about our lives.

109
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,400
- Not really, I can't do that.

110
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,930
- Okay, you know what, just
call me when you get time.

111
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,763
Bye bye.

112
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:54,618
(phone ringing)

113
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,620
Hello Bob.

114
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,863
- Yeah, okay listen.

115
00:05:59,863 --> 00:06:04,370
- It's 5400 Aspen Drive,
apartment six, Beechwood Canyon.

116
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,460
- All right, I'll be
there in five minutes.

117
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,420
That's real close.

118
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,160
- You know what, my
agent's calling me now.

119
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,110
I think he wants me to
be in one of your movies.

120
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,943
Bye Bob.

121
00:06:15,755 --> 00:06:17,233
I'll believe it when I see it.

122
00:06:19,108 --> 00:06:21,775
(phone ringing)

123
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:24,881
It's Sara.

124
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:26,763
Oh fuck.

125
00:06:35,555 --> 00:06:38,222
(phone ringing)

126
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,540
Hello?

127
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,630
- Oh thank God.

128
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,880
You didn't kill yourself.

129
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,950
You motherfucker.

130
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,300
Why send me the suicide note?

131
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,810
- You got the note?

132
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,633
- Yeah, Dickie, I got the note.

133
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,330
- I just mailed it to you.

134
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,630
How could you get the note so quickly?

135
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,820
- Dickie, why did you send me this note?

136
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,730
Why?

137
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,247
- Because you're my girl.

138
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,520
- No, no, Dickie, I'm not your girl.

139
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,210
I'm not your girl, we broke up.

140
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,690
Are you trying to pressure
me, is that what this is?

141
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:27,160
- No, no, I just thought
you would want to know,

142
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,330
and I thought I had the weekend,

143
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,820
I didn't realize you were
going to get the note so soon.

144
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,590
- Oh, oh yeah? Asshole.

145
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,880
- I meant what I wrote to you, you know.

146
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,470
- Oh, good, good, because
it would have been

147
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:41,340
the last thing you ever said, you fuck.

148
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,301
Next time, just send the
note to someone else, okay?

149
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:45,260
- Who?

150
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,650
I don't have anyone else.

151
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:47,950
- You don't?

152
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,113
I'm coming over later
to get you know what.

153
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,073
Bye.

154
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,874
- Luis, give me your cell phone.

155
00:08:16,874 --> 00:08:18,390
What hotel is Bonnie at?

156
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,970
- The Four Seasons.

157
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:20,803
- The Four Seasons?

158
00:08:20,803 --> 00:08:22,830
No wonder she's crazy about me.

159
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,310
What's the number there?

160
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,430
- It's on the speed dial.

161
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,340
- Ah come on, that's the
trouble with these things.

162
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,740
You lose your phone, you
lose all the numbers.

163
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,360
How does this work?

164
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,610
- Just press the buttons.

165
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:42,180
(soft acoustic guitar)

166
00:08:45,796 --> 00:08:48,463
(phone ringing)

167
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,730
- Listen Bonnie, it's me.

168
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,310
I'm sorry I haven't gotten to you,

169
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,860
but I lost my cell phone, I went jogging,

170
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,640
I banged up my knee again.

171
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,800
You know what it's like when
you lose your cell phone.

172
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,830
Call me on this phone, I'm in the limo.

173
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,863
It's Luis' phone, all right?

174
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,020
I'm sorry you've had to sit
around the hotel all day.

175
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,170
I'll make it up to you.

176
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,423
- Okay Bobby, we'll see
who's in your phone.

177
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,153
That way, celebrity central.

178
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,173
Maybe he really is Bobby Devillin.

179
00:10:37,326 --> 00:10:40,243

189
00:12:34,094 --> 00:12:36,239
Hey are you on your jet right now?

(dial tone)

196
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,020
Your career was over man,

00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,319
after Taxi Driver anyway, you know?

198
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:11,857
Are you talking to me?

199
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:14,807
You must be talking to me
because there's no one else here.

200

Are you talking to me?

201

00:13:52,761 --> 00:13:54,378
- This is it?

205
00:13:54,378 --> 00:13:56,461
Did you get that address?

206
00:14:00,357 --> 00:14:01,950
- Ahoy, Mister Devillin.

207
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,160
Up here, thank you for

Bonnie on the car phone.

patch me through on this cell, okay?

212
00:14:25,557 --> 00:14:26,390

I hope you can make it up those steps.

What the fuck just happened?

Okay, you know what, go fuck yourself.

I am flying back to New York tonight.

You call me later, forget it.

00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:24,528
you ever do that to me
again and I'll prosecute.

233
00:15:24,528 --> 00:15:26,973
I hope it took you an hour
to find your cell phone.

234
00:15:29,776 --> 00:15:31,343
- [Message Voice] There
are no more messages.

235
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,280
- Hey.

236
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,530
- Hi, how are you?

237
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,740
Thanks a lot for finding my phone.

238
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,700
- Hey, iced tea?

239
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,730
It's a long way up.

240
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,793
- No no no, thanks.

241
00:15:45,805 --> 00:15:47,670
I jog, I see it keeps you nice and trim.

242
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,503
- Okay.

243
00:15:48,503 --> 00:15:49,343
- So, can I get that phone?

244
00:15:49,343 --> 00:15:51,830
There's a lot of messages on
that phone I haven't picked up.

245
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:52,730
- Yeah yeah, sure.

246
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,450
Could I call you Bobby?

247
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,283
- Bobby?

248
00:15:57,283 --> 00:15:58,493
Sure, be my guest, Bobby.

249
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:02,130
- You made so many great movies.

250
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:02,963
- Yeah? Thanks.

251
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,063
- And then, dudsville, like nothing.

252
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,090
How does that happen?

253
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,260
- Well, what's your name?

254
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,460
- Dickie.

255
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,460
- Dickie?

256
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,950
Well you know Dickie,
even the great hitters

257
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,106
strike out once in a while.

258
00:16:16,106 --> 00:16:18,490
So, I gotta film coming
out in a little bit.

259
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,220
- Cool, good luck.

260
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,320
- Yeah, thanks.

261
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,970
- Would you play, What Movie with me.

262
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:24,980
- What?

263
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,420
- Five minutes, five minutes.

264
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,253
I'll start.
- You know,

265
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:28,710
I don't really have time
to play name that movie,

266
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:29,873
so can I get the phone?

267
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,483
So what?

268
00:16:35,483 --> 00:16:37,610
A couple a hundred dollars reward?

269
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,443
And you give me the phone.

270
00:16:38,443 --> 00:16:40,300
- I don't want your money.

271
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,133
Have a seat.

272
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,640
- Okay.

273
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,800
- Why were you in the park
at three in the afternoon?

274
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,660
The heat of the day.

275
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,090
- I jog.

276
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,180
- You jog?

277
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,450
- Yeah.

278
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,283
- Well, what happened?

279
00:16:52,283 --> 00:16:53,817
A bush jumped out and
grabbed the cell phone

280
00:16:53,817 --> 00:16:55,573
out of your Gucci sweatpants?

281
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,390
- Now look, you mind
if I use your bathroom?

282
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,620
- Yeah, it's right down there.

283
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,490
- Okay.

284
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,544
Thanks a lot.

285
00:17:01,544 --> 00:17:02,377
- It'd be an honor.

286
00:17:02,377 --> 00:17:03,323
A legend in my own can.

287
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,636
(toilet flushing)

288
00:17:11,636 --> 00:17:14,136
- Okay, is this going to work?

289
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:25,567
- Now look, you mind
if I use your bathroom?

290
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:33,933
- Luis, it's me.

291
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,020
I need you to get up
here as fast as you can,

292
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,336
and make up something about
a meeting or an appointment,

293
00:17:41,336 --> 00:17:42,169
you know, whatever.

294
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:43,953
Watch out for the killer steps.

295
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:02,807
Oh Dickie,

296
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,910
smells like burnt coffee in here.

297
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,020
- Ah, double espresso.

298
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,188
It's the last legal drug.

299
00:18:10,188 --> 00:18:11,440
It keeps me up so I don't get depressed

300
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,600
and want to kill myself.

301
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,440
You want one?

302
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,273
- No, no thanks.

303
00:18:14,273 --> 00:18:17,463
So I was thinking, maybe
come by my office next week,

304
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,560
call my secretary, set up an appointment.

305
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,630
Have some casting directors come in,

306
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,780
maybe make something happen for you.

307
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,140
- No, no no.

308
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,300
I'm done with acting.

309
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,133
I'm over it.

310
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,100
I'd rather be a waiter at the Ivy,

311
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,220
or behind the counter at Starbuck's,

312
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,090
with you looking at me,

313
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,650
like I gotta me some
sort of mental patient

314
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,050
and fuck up your order.

315
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,440
Hey.

316
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,750
- Where's Mister Devillin?

317
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,900
- I'm right here, Luis.

318
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,200
- You're late for your next appointment.

319
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,150
- Oh.

320
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,630
- So, I really gotta go.

321
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,463
- Yeah, sure.

322
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,993
- The phone, please.

323
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:56,213
- Bobby, you said that to me
like I'm sort of employee,

324
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,740
like a lower form of animal,

325
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,900
like I'm some sort of bug on your path

326
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,300
to interplanetary life, man.

327
00:19:03,481 --> 00:19:05,690
- Well, you really are a
piece of work, you know that?

328
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,520
What do you want, like a gazillion dollars

329
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,413
for this frickin' phone?

330
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:10,623
Give me the goddamn cell phone.

331
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,210
- It could be in here.

332
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,043
Oh.

333
00:19:19,653 --> 00:19:20,486
- I got it.

334
00:19:20,486 --> 00:19:21,410
- Okay, good.

335
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,689
- You ready to leave sir?

336
00:19:22,689 --> 00:19:24,960
- You know this is no
way to treat a producer.

337
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,170
I mean you're never gonna
get anywhere like this.

338
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,000
You got a bad attitude man.

339
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,040
Now I could have done something for you.

340
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,700
I could have put you in a
movie, gotten you a part,

341
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,453
but now, I don't even
want to know your name.

342
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,773
Luis.

343
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,860
- Vaya con dios.

344
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,873
Drive safely, Luis.

345
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,449
Did you grow up in a barn?

346
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:52,111
- Give me that.

347
00:19:53,854 --> 00:19:58,224
Geez, you believe that kid?

348
00:19:58,224 --> 00:20:01,057
This is not my fuckin' cell phone.

349
00:20:04,046 --> 00:20:05,213
Come on, Luis.

350
00:20:10,097 --> 00:20:12,370
You punk, this is not my cell phone.

351
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,200
- You are a big man, Bob.

352
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,763
How'd you get up here so fast?

353
00:20:17,975 --> 00:20:18,808
- I'm callin' the cops.

354
00:20:18,808 --> 00:20:20,060
I'm gonna call the cops.

355
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,140
- Oh, here's my phone, use my landline.

356
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,080
- You want a part?

357
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,990
I'm gonna give you a part.

358
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,227
I'm gonna tear you apart.

359
00:20:26,227 --> 00:20:27,074
- I don't wanna fight.

360
00:20:27,074 --> 00:20:29,450
No, I got it, I got your phone, I got it.

361
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,450
- Give me the damn phone.

362
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,355
- I got it, I got it, look.

363
00:20:33,355 --> 00:20:34,188
Is this it?

364
00:20:34,188 --> 00:20:35,021
- Gimme it.

365
00:20:35,021 --> 00:20:35,854
- Because I don't know where it was.

366
00:20:35,854 --> 00:20:36,800
- Luis,

367
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,082
get the phone Luis.

368
00:20:38,082 --> 00:20:39,183
He's got it right there.

369
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,817
- You're funny, you're funny.

370
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,310
Jesus Christ, what they hell you doin'?

371
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,340
Look at this thing he's got.

372
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,423
- Homeland security.

373
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,713
We got something going on here.

374
00:20:58,713 --> 00:21:01,146
- I got the friggin'--

375
00:21:01,146 --> 00:21:02,160
- Mister Devillin go wait in the car,

376
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,460
while I take care of this.

377
00:21:06,502 --> 00:21:08,460
- I can't believe this, you
think you can mess with me?

378
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,760
You think you can do this to me?

379
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,920
You son of a bitch.

380
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,350
You can't treat me like this.

381
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,183
- Hey.

382
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,363
You ever seen yourself on TV?

383
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,697
- What?

384
00:21:23,697 --> 00:21:26,170
- You know like on a surveillance camera,

385
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,200
committing a felony?

386
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,470
Yeah, check it out, right over there.

387
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,920
Go hit the button over there.

388
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,151
- What are you talking about?

389
00:21:33,151 --> 00:21:33,984
- Right over there.

390
00:21:33,984 --> 00:21:34,972
Go on, turn around.

391
00:21:34,972 --> 00:21:35,805
Turn around.

392
00:21:35,805 --> 00:21:37,010
- What are you talking--
- Turn around.

393
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:38,610
Go press that button down there.

394
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,210
- Hit it where, right?

395
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,810
- Webcam, you ever heard of one?

396
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,960
Yeah, there it is.

397
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,850
I already emailed it to myself.

398
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,230
I only did it to prove that you were here,

399
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,740
but now I'll probably
turn it over to the cops

400
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,900
to prove that you and Boris
here were assaulting me.

401
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,805
You're assaulting me now, as I speak.

402
00:21:55,805 --> 00:21:56,638
- Luis, he's got this whole thing set up,

403
00:21:56,638 --> 00:21:57,720
he's got it rigged.

404
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,553
Get off of him.

405
00:21:58,553 --> 00:21:59,386
Get off of him.

406
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:00,363
Luis, let him go.

407
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,390
Leave him alone.

408
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,223
- Thank you Pop.

409
00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:05,547
- All right, you're gonna
turn this off now, right?

410
00:22:05,547 --> 00:22:07,247
And you're gonna give me the tape.

411
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,213
- Bob,

412
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,323
I am trying to help you here, that's all.

413
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:18,010
I even, I took the liberty
of downloading your messages.

414
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:18,843
- What?

415
00:22:18,843 --> 00:22:20,529
- For you, I've got it all up
here, don't worry about it.

416
00:22:20,529 --> 00:22:21,362
- What are you talking about?

417
00:22:21,362 --> 00:22:23,160
How could you get my
messages off of my phone.

418
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,620
- I started with birth years.

419
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,660
Hi 1955, you must be 48, huh?

420
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,720
- What?

421
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,310
- I installed security systems
before I became a waiter.

422
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:35,330
Next time you should try
using your wife's bra size.

423
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,780
Or Bonnie's.

424
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,490
- Turn the thing off,

425
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,790
and we'll talk.

426
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,983
I mean it's all a big
misunderstanding, okay?

427
00:22:41,983 --> 00:22:42,910
- We should step outside Bob,

428
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,240
away from the cameras.

429
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,393
- Luis, go over there.

430
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,150
- And you're Tarzan.

431
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,830
Tampering with a security devices

432
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:52,440
immediately notifies the fuzz.

433
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,270
You don't wanna mess with them.

434
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,103
It's a secret.

435
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,120
- Luis, back up, move over there.

436
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,393
- [Dickie] Come on, Bob.

437
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:06,943
- I'm coming.

438
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:14,580
(phone ringing)

439
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,413
Yes.

440
00:23:15,413 --> 00:23:16,350
- [Man On Phone] He's on an airplane.

441
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,019
Where were you? We're fucked.

442
00:23:18,019 --> 00:23:20,143
- Well this is the
first I got the message.

443
00:23:20,143 --> 00:23:21,099
What happened?

444
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:21,932
- [Man On Phone] He can't do it.

445
00:23:21,932 --> 00:23:22,765
- What, that little bastard.

446
00:23:22,765 --> 00:23:25,120
What do you mean, he left
because of a Michigan accent?

447
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,740
Get Ben on the phone
and make him an offer.

448
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,640
- [Man On Phone] You know
he's got conflicts for months,

449
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,820
we'll lose Gwyneth.

450
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,860
- [Bobby] All right, call Tom,

451
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,513
call Tom then call me back.

452
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,650
- Michigan accent, huh?

453
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,580
- Yeah, they're doing
a movie up in Michigan,

454
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,940
about Hemingway, about fly fishing.

455
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,000
- Big Tom as Hemingway?

456
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,350
That's a bit of a stretch,
no wonder he walked.

457
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,105
Hey Hemingway shot himself, right?

458
00:23:47,105 --> 00:23:48,560
(phone ringing)

459
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,760
That's Bonnie, you know.

460
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,060
She's on her way to the airport.

461
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:55,577
She's real pissed at you.

462
00:23:55,577 --> 00:23:57,210
(phone ringing)

463
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,173
- Hey, you know,

464
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:00,753
gee whiz.

465
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:04,170
Let me be the first to
apologize here, all right.

466
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:06,150
I just think we got off
on the wrong foot today,

467
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,660
something screwy happened.

468
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,730
As you know I'm having a very bad week,

469
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,010
so what do you say?

470
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,520
I mean, let's start over.

471
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,353
There's gotta be a way,

472
00:24:13,353 --> 00:24:15,820
that you and I can come
together on this thing, huh?

473
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,683
- Fuck you man.

474
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:18,400
- Come on.

475
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,150
Fuck me, what kind of language is that?

476
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,023
- Bob, I'm sorry.

477
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,610
Let's have dinner.

478
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:26,770
Come on, we could call
some of your celeb friends.

479
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,880
What about Kevin C.

480
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,220
I don't know who that is.

481
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,710
Harrison, Harrison, he's probably free.

482
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:35,593
- Dickie, I don't think
that's gonna happen.

483
00:24:35,593 --> 00:24:36,940
(phone ringing)

484
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,773
- How much?

485
00:24:37,773 --> 00:24:39,540
- [Bonnie] Bobby, what's going on?

486
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,373
- Sorry Bonnie.

487
00:24:40,373 --> 00:24:42,230
- [Bonnie] I'm checking out of the hotel.

488
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,170
- No no, no.

489
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,003
- [Bonnie] I'm leaving.

490
00:24:44,003 --> 00:24:44,860
- What do you mean, you're leaving?

491
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,900
Why are you leaving?

492
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,970
You didn't get my message?

493
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:47,989
- [Bonnie] They've called me a cab.

494
00:24:47,989 --> 00:24:48,840
- I left you a message, don't leave.

495
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,330
Don't leave, I don't want you to leave.

496
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,163
- [Bonnie] I'm leaving.

497
00:24:51,163 --> 00:24:52,520
- Don't leave.

498
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,570
- [Bonnie] Bye Bobby.

499
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:58,217
- Hoo, no more kissy
kissy, goodbye I love you.

500
00:24:58,217 --> 00:24:59,960
I love you more.

501
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,630
- She hung up on me.

502
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,430
- Yeah, I'd hang up on you too, Bob.

503
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,030
Let's go inside and have a bloody mary.

504
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,360
- No.

505
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,193
Let's settle this.

506
00:25:12,193 --> 00:25:13,270
- Let's have a beer.

507
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,103
- No.

508
00:25:14,103 --> 00:25:14,936
We're gonna fix this.

509
00:25:14,936 --> 00:25:16,700
- Hey, I got an idea,
let's go call Bonnie.

510
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,223
- Call Bonnie?

511
00:25:24,834 --> 00:25:26,820
(busy signal)

512
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,653
- She's busy.

513
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,120
Hey Chico, get away, get
away from my stuff, okay?

514
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,110
You don't want to be touching that.

515
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,847
- Hey, Dickie Dickie, hey what's all this

516
00:25:35,847 --> 00:25:37,140
you got here on the wall?

517
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,620
- It's my wall of shame, Bob.

518
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,520
- Yeah?

519
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,013
- Every movie I ever tried
out for and didn't get.

520
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,550
- No kidding, this guy.

521
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,840
So, who's this?

522
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,673
- It's my dad.

523
00:25:52,244 --> 00:25:53,890
You recognize him?

524
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:57,090
- This is the guy, played
the janitor in Animal House.

525
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,420
Am I right?

526
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,550
Why do I know that?

527
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,030
- It's his biggest role.

528
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:01,863
- Yeah?

529
00:26:01,863 --> 00:26:03,360
- The made him eat a mouse in that one,

530
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,453
but at least it didn't kill him.

531
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,973
Actor Brian Bates,

532
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,530
died Tuesday while cleaning

533
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,943
his cherished antique handgun.

534
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,320
He began his acting career early, as Otis,

535
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,410
Dennis' sometime friend in
the Dennis the Menace show.

536
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:26,420
Later he married budding
teenage star Crystal Rose,

537
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,740
whom he met while appearing as a musketeer

538
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,623
in a Micky Mouse show in 1972.

539
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,693
Divorced shortly after
having a son in 1975,

540
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,973
he shifted into movies,

541
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,560
receiving his greatest fame
as Poop, the poor janitor,

542
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,000
in Animal House.

543
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,180
Later he returned to his roots,

544
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,240
appearing in such favorites as Dallas,

545
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,123
Fantasy Island.

546
00:26:50,077 --> 00:26:50,910
He leaves behind

547
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:55,717
blah blah blah blah.

548
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,600
- Wow.

549
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,150
You got it memorized?

550
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,200
- Yeah.

551
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,780
I wrote it.

552
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,680
No one else would.

553
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,700
Suicide, died when he was 37.

554
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,110
- Shit, that's young.

555
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,553
- Not to him.

556
00:27:15,147 --> 00:27:16,620
- I'm sorry.

557
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,453
- Don't be.

558
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,550
It was long as he was
willing to be a failure.

559
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,723
I discovered the body, I was 17.

560
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:26,970
- Geez, that's tough.

561
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,520
That's a tough row to hoe, huh?

562
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:32,200
You know, I know a little
bit about rejection.

563
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,740
I'm in the rejection business.

564
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,573
So,

565
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:37,523
I understand.

566
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,050
So, Dickie, what do you think?

567
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:43,750
We all done here?

568
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,583
We okay?

569
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:46,893
Yeah?

570
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,493
All right well, I'm gonna go Dickie.

571
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,163
Give me a call.

572
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,103
Either way.

573
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,443
Be well.

574
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,270
Come on Luis.

575
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,103
- Fine with me.

576
00:28:11,867 --> 00:28:14,534
(phone dialing)

577
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:18,863
- [Woman] Hello?

578
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:19,696
- Hey Bonnie.

579
00:28:19,696 --> 00:28:20,529
- [Bonnie] Who is this?

580
00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:22,720
- Hey, it's Bobby's friend, yes.

581
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,510
Well listen, we're having
a barbecue up here Bonnie.

582
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:28,810
5400 Aspen Drive, yeah apartment six.

583
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:29,643
Beechwood.

584
00:28:29,643 --> 00:28:30,900
- [Bonnie] Is Bobby still there?

585
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,020
- Yeah, Bobby's here.

586
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,320
You can talk to him.

587
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,153
- Hello?

588
00:28:34,153 --> 00:28:34,986
- [Bonnie] Hello Bobby.

589
00:28:34,986 --> 00:28:35,952
- Hi darling,

590
00:28:35,952 --> 00:28:38,140
no, you don't need to get in the cab.

591
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,440
No, there's no party
we're not doing anything.

592
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,444
- [Bonnie] I will be
there in five minutes.

593
00:28:42,444 --> 00:28:43,700
- Bonnie?
(dial tone)

594
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,533
Bonnie?

595
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,860
- Four Seasons ain't far.

596
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,987
She'll be here any minute.

597
00:28:48,987 --> 00:28:51,910
- You know, she's having
a tough time right now.

598
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,030
You talk about one person

599
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:55,000
contributing to another person's demise?

600
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,700
Push her right over the
edge, why don't you?

601
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,270
- You're obviously not there for her, Bob.

602
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,320
- She's not answering now.

603
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,930
- Well, I guess you're just
gonna have to stay then,

604
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:03,690
until she gets here at least.

605
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,060
Hey maybe we should call out for steaks.

606
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,850
- No, I'll have Luis
go and get some steaks.

607
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:10,490
You know for Bonnie, because
Bonnie doesn't eat steaks,

608
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,165
she's a vegan, a vagan, whatever.

609
00:29:12,165 --> 00:29:13,720
- I used to be a vegan, you know,

610
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,610
until I realized that, you know,

611
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:17,350
if you want to be a big
fish, top of the food chain,

612
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,090
you gotta start eating like one.

613
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,683
- Come on, if I get her on the
phone, you can pick her up.

614
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,820
- I can't wait to meet Bonnie.

615
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,453
I can't wait.

616
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,503
This thing's on its last mission to Mars.

617
00:29:47,257 --> 00:29:49,660
You got a lighter, Bob?

618
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,220
- [Bob] No, no I don't, I never smoked.

619
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,220
- Well, that's good.

620
00:29:55,816 --> 00:29:57,780
I gave it up when my wife got pregnant.

621
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,820
- You have kids, God forbid?

622
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,700
- No, she does.

623
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,670
She went back to Paris,
before she even had him.

624
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,810
I guess she figured raising a kid

625
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:09,800
with a depressed, out of
work actor was depressing.

626
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,689
- Yeah, well I'm sorry.

627
00:30:11,689 --> 00:30:14,440
I got two kids with my first wife,

628
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,936
and they grew up without seeing me.

629
00:30:16,936 --> 00:30:18,790
It's criminal.

630
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,050
You don't ever visit?

631
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:20,883
- No.

632
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,740
- Really?

633
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,140
Hey you know, I got an idea.

634
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,610
You and I could settle up right here

635
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:28,670
if you allow me to buy
you an airplane ticket

636
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:31,810
to see your child whenever you want.

637
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:32,940
What's the child's name?

638
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,773
- Jimmy Stewart.

639
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,033
- Jimmy Stewart?

640
00:30:36,033 --> 00:30:37,700
Well you can go see Jimmy
Stewart whenever you want

641
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,190
and we're even.

642
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,630
What do you say?

643
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,740
To be a father denied, I understand.

644
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,750
All right, that's like
never being a parent at all,

645
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:45,839
it's worse.

646
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:47,380
(phone ringing)

647
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,213
Yeah?

648
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:49,225
- [Woman] Hello, Bobby?

649
00:30:49,225 --> 00:30:50,770
- You are a slave to that
thing man, get rid of it.

650
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,788
- [Woman] I see you found your cell phone.

651
00:30:51,788 --> 00:30:52,621
(horn honking)

652
00:30:52,621 --> 00:30:53,930
- Oh.

653
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:54,763
That's Bonnie.

654
00:30:54,763 --> 00:30:55,722
I'll go get her, why don't you stay here?

655
00:30:55,722 --> 00:30:56,960
- No no no no no no, you
stay here, you stay here,

656
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,330
it's gonna be better if I go see her,

657
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,060
because she's a little funny, hold on.

658
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,320
- [Woman] What's going on now?

659
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,750
- Listen, Karen I can't talk right now,

660
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:05,090
because I'm in the middle of a
serious negotiation with Tom,

661
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,160
I'm in his trailer.

662
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,790
All right, I'm gonna call you
back in about a half hour.

663
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,946
- [Karen] You motherfucker.

664
00:31:09,946 --> 00:31:11,310
Who do you think you fuck--

665
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,850
- You know what, I'm
gonna give you $20,000

666
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:16,159
to let this whole thing
go right now, okay?

667
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:16,992
What do you say?

668
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,990
- No, no I don't really
want your money, man,

669
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,060
I was gonna commit suicide,

670
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,860
why would I want your fuckin' money?

671
00:31:25,103 --> 00:31:26,537
Get me a sequel man?

672
00:31:32,067 --> 00:31:35,650
(pensive orchestral music)

673
00:31:46,378 --> 00:31:47,708
- [Bob] Whoa, hold that kettle.

674
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:48,723
Hold the (muffled).

675
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:51,504
- [Bonnie] What are you doing here?

676
00:31:51,504 --> 00:31:52,337
- Why did you come?

677
00:31:52,337 --> 00:31:53,180
I told you not to come.

678
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,910
- This is your other
girlfriend's house isn't it?

679
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,250
- No, no.

680
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,380
This is the home of
some whacked out actor.

681
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,213
- Really?

682
00:31:59,213 --> 00:32:00,210
- Yeah, the guy's a head case.

683
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,410
He found my cell phone.

684
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:02,243
He wouldn't give it back,

685
00:32:02,243 --> 00:32:03,680
he made me come all the
way over here to get it.

686
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,513
- Really?

687
00:32:04,513 --> 00:32:05,410
And that's more important than me,

688
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,220
who's three months'
pregnant with your child?

689
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,120
- [Bob] Yes it is.

690
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:08,953
- [Bonnie] Really, really?

691
00:32:08,953 --> 00:32:10,540
- [Bob] It is yes, because he downloaded

692
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,010
every single number that
was in my cell phone.

693
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,450
He has the private line

694
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:16,130
of every major movie star in the business,

695
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:16,970
every major player.

696
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,620
Can you imagine, if he sold
that to the National Inquirer,

697
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,720
where I'd be?

698
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,920
He'd make zillions,

699
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,660
and I'd be known as the
only producer in town

700
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,833
you cannot give your phone number to.

701
00:32:24,833 --> 00:32:26,643
- It's always something with you, Bobby.

702
00:32:26,643 --> 00:32:27,476
- Yeah, what do I do?

703
00:32:27,476 --> 00:32:30,476
- I don't know what you're gonna do.

704
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,440
- Okay, here's what we do,

705
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,630
we go inside right?

706
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:42,240
You make nice, sit down,
have a drink, whatever,

707
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,730
then all of a sudden, you don't feel good.

708
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:44,563
- A drink?

709
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:45,750
I'm pregnant, remember?

710
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:46,680
Hello?

711
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,720
- [Bob] Listen, then we
go back to the hotel,

712
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,470
and maybe in the course of all that,

713
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,040
it'll give me some
private time with the guy,

714
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,587
and we can close this deal.

715
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:00,647
(tense jazz music)

716
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,490
Above all else, don't say anything

717
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,160
about the pregnancy thing, all right?

718
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,993
High alert.

719
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:49,826
This guy's whacko.

720
00:33:49,826 --> 00:33:51,330
- Fine.

721
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,163
- How's your hotel?

722
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:54,440
- The hotel sucks Bobby, I've
been there since 12 o'clock.

723
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,430
Where were you?

724
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,263
- Did you get any rest?

725
00:33:56,263 --> 00:33:57,096
- No, I didn't get any rest.

726
00:33:57,096 --> 00:33:57,929
I've been waiting for you.

727
00:33:57,929 --> 00:34:00,167
I've been crying my
eyes out all afternoon.

728
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:01,000
- Well maybe that's all part

729
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,530
of this pregnancy stuff, you know?

730
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:04,780
- You're such an asshole.

731
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,203
- Hey guys.

732
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,050
Hello Bonnie.

733
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,560
Come this way Bob.

734
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,263
We shall light the fire.

735
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:21,887
This way sir, this way.

736
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:24,460
Now, it's very easy.

737
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,173
I've done it many many times.

738
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:28,223
Whoa!

739
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,960
Watch out for those Bob.

740
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,793
Really careful.

741
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,740
Bonnie, you look a little pregnant,

742
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,163
would you like to sit down?

743
00:34:39,593 --> 00:34:40,953
Would you like some iced tea?

744
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,550
- Uh, iced tea would be fine.

745
00:34:44,598 --> 00:34:45,431
- Good.

746
00:34:51,165 --> 00:34:52,165
Here you go.

747
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:54,498
Is it a boy or a girl?

748
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,653
- We don't know.

749
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,640
- Well, you don't look all sad like that.

750
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,490
I'm sure it's not a mutant.

751
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:05,260
I bet you it's a boy, you've
got that, it's a boy look.

752
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,540
- Really?

753
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,460
- No.

754
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:10,577
But, statistically, women over 40--

755
00:35:10,577 --> 00:35:12,193
- I'm 36, thank you.

756
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,733
- Sorry.

757
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,260
My humblest apologies.

758
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,240
- Except that you know, I'm sorry,

759
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,800
but I didn't get your name.

760
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,120
- Dickie Bates, Junior.

761
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,020
I know it's a bad name.

762
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:27,810
Listen, do not name your child

763
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:29,860
Woody, or Rod,

764
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,700
or Dickie, it's not funny.

765
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,220
It's a curse, you know.

766
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,390
- Well you're an actor, why
didn't you just change it?

767
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:39,090
- Because I wanted to prove to my father

768
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:40,073
that I beat it.

769
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,003
- Oh.

770
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:43,723
- Stupid, right?

771
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,580
- Yeah, I guess.

772
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,813
- He's dead now anyway.

773
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,332
- What a shame.

774
00:35:52,332 --> 00:35:53,250
- He was an actor, you know.

775
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,320
- [Bonnie] Really?
- Like me.

776
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,940
And his photos are right in there.

777
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,790
Do you want to take a look?

778
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,463
You might recognize him.

779
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,383
- You know what?

780
00:36:00,383 --> 00:36:01,800
I'd love to have a look.

781
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,720
My father was a TV actor, too.

782
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,666
- Really?
- Yeah.

783
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:06,860
- Uh, Bonnie,

784
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,630
maybe we should give Luis a call,

785
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,600
and see if he's picking up the right stuff

786
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,960
for you to put in your mouth.

787
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,020
- Wait a minute, I thought you
didn't have your cell phone.

788
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,853
- I didn't.

789
00:36:14,853 --> 00:36:16,240
But I--

790
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,180
I got it back.

791
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,013
- Okay, whatever.

792
00:36:18,013 --> 00:36:19,290
You know, I'll call him.

793
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:20,123
- You want to call him?

794
00:36:20,123 --> 00:36:20,956
- Yes.

795
00:36:20,956 --> 00:36:21,789
- Be my guest.

796
00:36:21,789 --> 00:36:22,900
- He was a daytime soap opera star.

797
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,140
He played a doctor on All My Children,

798
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,337
back in New York, and
then we moved out here,

799
00:36:25,337 --> 00:36:27,770
and his career collapsed.

800
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:30,225
- I only saw my father on TV.

801
00:36:30,225 --> 00:36:32,630
- Oh my parents divorced too, get over it.

802
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:34,700
- Bonnie?
- Yeah?

803
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,023
- Speed dial number three.

804
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:37,910
You're number one.

805
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,890
- Dickie Junior.

806
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,210
What name would you choose

807
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:44,010
if you could start all over again?

808
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:46,513
- Ah, Benjamin,

809
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,560
Nicholas,

810
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,760
poetic names, you know.

811
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,190
Dickie Bates, it's like
spitting the syllables out.

812
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,840
- I know we've only just met but,

813
00:36:55,974 --> 00:36:57,600
why don't I call you Benjamin, huh?

814
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,050
Why not?

815
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,880
- Because I gotta stick
with the hand I was dealt.

816
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,360
- How fatalist, how charming.

817
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,193
Luis?

818
00:37:04,193 --> 00:37:05,660
Yes, where are you?

819
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,920
The checkout line, uh huh.

820
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,343
Steaks, tofu.

821
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,280
Yeah can you pick up some of
those vegetables to grill,

822
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,730
you know, the cut up kind?

823
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,680
- Hey, have him get some tequila too.

824
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,910
- Oh, and grab a fifth
of tequila, will you?

825
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:19,273
Great, fantastic, see you soon, ciao.

826
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,320
- Bonnie, sweetheart.

827
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,420
Why don't you come on over here

828
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,930
and help me stoke the barbecue?

829
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:28,230
- Hey, are you guys gonna get married?

830
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:31,010
Or is this gonna be another bastard child

831
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:31,843
brought into the world?

832
00:37:31,843 --> 00:37:33,580
- That's a hotly debated topic, Benjamin.

833
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,730
We'd rather not discuss it.

834
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:35,630
- I see.

835
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,030
- But, thanks for asking.

836
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:39,750
It's very kind of you to
have concerns for our child.

837
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:42,060
We'll make sure to tell him or her

838
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,830
that you weighed in our
decision later in life,

839
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,100
now won't we dear?

840
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:45,980
- You feelin' all right?

841
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:48,100
- Oh, I'm feeling just fine.

842
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,040
Getting some fresh air
is just what I needed.

843
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,040
You know, big hotel windows never open.

844
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,590
- Oh, you know why I think that is.

845
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,660
Suicide.

846
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,300
The Four Seasons, they
don't want to become

847
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,409
the Golden Gate Bridge of Hollywood.

848
00:38:00,409 --> 00:38:01,450
- I was in New York.

849
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:02,700
I didn't come all the way to California

850
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,040
to check out a hotel room.

851
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,580
- Yeah, well you look a
little flushed, you know?

852
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,840
Well, you could use a nap,

853
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,130
so maybe when Luis gets here,

854
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:09,500
I'll send you back to the hotel.

855
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,110
- Fine, but I'm not leaving without you.

856
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,723
- Come on, think of the baby.

857
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:14,960
- Fuck the baby, think
of me carrying the baby.

858
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,306
- That's no way to talk about our baby.

859
00:38:17,306 --> 00:38:18,880
- Whoa, ding ding ding.

860
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,470
Hey hey, you guys are marriage material.

861
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,120
I mean you're already arguing,

862
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,260
by the time you tie the knot,

863
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,960
you'll have it perfected to a fine art.

864
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,393
- Just because we're
control freaks, you know?

865
00:38:28,393 --> 00:38:30,843
When one or the other
doesn't get his or her way,

866
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,020
it makes them upset.

867
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,000
Right, Tulip?

868
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,678
- That's pretty obvious, isn't it?

869
00:38:35,678 --> 00:38:36,750
- And you know what I think?

870
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,703
I think I am a lot like you, Bob.

871
00:38:38,703 --> 00:38:41,430
I am a control freak
because I wanted to know

872
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:43,910
the exact minute that I
was gonna kill myself.

873
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,560
- That's really stupid, Benjamin.

874
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,060
- I know.

875
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,670
But, lucky for me, Bob came along

876
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,760
and took my gun from me.

877
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,190
- Excuse me?

878
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,023
Gun?

879
00:38:54,023 --> 00:38:55,060
- [Dickie] He put it in his pocket.

880
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,140
- Whoa!

881
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,580
There's Luis.

882
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,520
Aren't you tired?

883
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,060
- No, actually I'm starving.

884
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,600
Luis.

885
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,724
- Sorry I take so long Mister Devillin.

886
00:39:03,724 --> 00:39:05,070
- That's all right Luis, you tried.

887
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:06,213
- So nice to see you.

888
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,433
Dickie, why don't you
get Luis an iced tea?

889
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:12,450
The grill's up here.

890
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,510
You got the steaks and
the tofu and everything?

891
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:17,040
- So you expect me to cook, too?

892
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,320
- Oh come on, I'll help you.

893
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,840
- I feel like celebrating.

894
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,000
Who wants a margarita?

895
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,880
- I'd love one.

896
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,670
- Bobby? Luis?

897
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,580
- No.

898
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,870
- Fine, it only takes two to tango.

899
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:28,410
How do you like it, strong or mild?

900
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:29,455
- Make your best.

901
00:39:29,455 --> 00:39:31,900
- [Dickie] I'm gonna go
get the blender, stay put.

902
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:32,733
- Great.

903
00:39:32,733 --> 00:39:33,710
- What are you doing?

904
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:35,483
Are you?

905
00:39:35,483 --> 00:39:37,150
- Where the fuck were you
this morning when you called?

906
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:39,884
Why weren't you at the airport
Bobby, to meet me, huh?

907
00:39:39,884 --> 00:39:40,717
Why?

908
00:39:40,717 --> 00:39:41,700
- Come on, we've been
through this, I told you.

909
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,070
I was jogging, I lost my cell phone.

910
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:46,070
Besides, I thought your flight
came in at five o'clock.

911
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:46,903
All right, I'm sorry.

912
00:39:46,903 --> 00:39:48,390
- I changed it, and you knew it.

913
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:50,590
- Look, you know I haven't
squared this up with Vee yet.

914
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:53,100
I haven't talked to her
since I lost my cell phone.

915
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,550
- You can't do it, can you?

916
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,383
- Yeah, I can do it.

917
00:39:55,383 --> 00:39:57,280
I just think that after
15 years of marriage,

918
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,330
I owe her a little bit of an explanation.

919
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,070
- You're not gonna leave her, I know it.

920
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:04,340
- I can, that's not
true, that's so untrue.

921
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,370
Come on sweetheart, you
know what I've been through.

922
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,010
I love you more than I ever loved her.

923
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:09,960
- Well, you better.

924
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:13,520
- Don't you want to go back to the hotel?

925
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,900
- Wait, anybody want
to change their minds?

926
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,733
Bobby, Luis?

927
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,370
- [Bob] Uh, no thanks.

928
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:24,530
There are some meetings I have to do.

929
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,810
- All right, well, then Bonnie and I will

930
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:29,300
just have to go on without you.

931
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,323
Slug 'em back while you two go home.

932
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,360
Here you are, my dear.

933
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,920
- Thank you, Benjamin.

934
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,500
- Whoa, the way you said that,

935
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,672
you sounded just like Anne
Bancroft in The Graduate,

936
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:42,372
and I put it together immediately.

937
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,972
- What?

938
00:40:53,972 --> 00:40:55,340
- Honey, you want to
slow down a little bit?

939
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,363
- Why Bobby, what else am I gonna do?

940
00:40:59,064 --> 00:41:01,073
- I don't know, you know.

941
00:41:01,073 --> 00:41:03,220
I've never seen you chugalug tequila

942
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,933
like some 25 dollar hooker.

943
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,740
- Poor me another one before
dinner, would you please?

944
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,910
- You sure you should have
another drink, Missus Robinson?

945
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:12,073
- Poor Benjamin.

946
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,160
- Hey, hombre Luis.

947
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,690
You cook a mean steak there partner.

948
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:19,710
I bet you didn't pick that up

949
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,930
down in old shanty town Mexico.

950
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:22,939
- Hey.

951
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:23,772
- What?

952
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,010
- Bad joke.

953
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:26,720
- I'm just being honest with the man.

954
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,660
- Oh like actors are the most

955
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,140
honest people out there, right?

956
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,070
- Let's just say, producers
make better liars.

957
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:34,080
- So true, right Bobby?

958
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,720
- Honey, don't start.

959
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,780
- Don't start?

960
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,530
Darling, we're almost finished.

961
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,500
It's over, if you don't leave your wife.

962
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,333
We're through.

963
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:49,083
Right, you're not gonna do it.

964
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,880
- [Bob] What are you talking about?

965
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,300
I mean do we have to talk about this

966
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,133
in front of everybody?

967
00:41:55,133 --> 00:41:56,270
I have an appointment in a half an hour.

968
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:58,070
Maybe we could talk about it in the limo,

969
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,560
and not in front of other people.

970
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,663
- He isn't gonna do it, is he?

971
00:42:00,663 --> 00:42:01,823
- I don't think so.

972
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,850
- You know, you call her Bobby,

973
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:06,830
you call her right now,
call her this minute,

974
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:09,630
or Luis is gonna take me
straight to the airport.

975
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:10,463
- I can't.

976
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:12,203
I can't do that.

977
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,840
- You're not gonna do it?

978
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,010
- Come on sweetheart, really,

979
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:17,770
I mean maybe just go back to the hotel,

980
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:20,080
and I'll meet up with you
later on tonight, please?

981
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,240
- When I slit my wrists
when you don't show up?

982
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,470
- You made your point, all right?

983
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:25,303
We get the message.

984
00:42:25,303 --> 00:42:27,070
We understand, right fellas?

985
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:29,710
- Why don't we just sit
down and have a meal?

986
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:30,543
- What is it with you you two?

987
00:42:30,543 --> 00:42:32,630
You and brotherhood of
penises, why don't you shut up?

988
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,817
- Fine, carry on.

989
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:36,533
- Hey you, mind your
business, get the plates.

990
00:42:38,557 --> 00:42:40,980
- You know I love you, I love you.

991
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:45,100
I love you, I am marrying you, I promise.

992
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,490
Just give it a day, a
week, a couple of weeks.

993
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:48,470
I love you.

994
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:49,810
- We need to talk, Bobby.

995
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:51,580
We need to talk, now.

996
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,413
I haven't seen

997
00:42:52,413 --> 00:42:53,246
you in weeks.
- We'll talk,

998
00:42:53,246 --> 00:42:54,079
but do we have to talk here

999
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,320
in some strange,
- Don't you care

1000
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,370
about my feelings?
- weird guy's balcony?

1001
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:57,571
- I mean trying to talk to you--

1002
00:42:57,571 --> 00:42:58,404
- But you're acting like

1003
00:42:58,404 --> 00:42:59,874
- I've been calling
you since this morning.

1004
00:42:59,874 --> 00:43:00,707
- What do you want from me?

1005
00:43:00,707 --> 00:43:03,120
I mean all I'm asking you to
do is go back to the hotel,

1006
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,720
so that I can come by
later, and then we can--

1007
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,820
- You're such an asshole.

1008
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,223
You keep putting me off.

1009
00:43:09,774 --> 00:43:10,607
- If you really want to talk about this

1010
00:43:10,607 --> 00:43:12,400
we can go right back to the hotel.

1011
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,303
- Bobby, you're such a fuckin' liar.

1012
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:16,263
Bobby's fuck hotel is closed, okay?

1013
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:18,298
Get your hands off of me.

1014
00:43:18,298 --> 00:43:19,489
- What kind of remark
is that to make to me?

1015
00:43:19,489 --> 00:43:21,650
- How many women have you
not promised to marry,

1016
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:23,006
that jumped Bobby, huh?

1017
00:43:23,006 --> 00:43:23,839
Why don't you tell me that?

1018
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:25,793
- Bonnie Bobby Devillin,
it's got a nice ring to it.

1019
00:43:25,793 --> 00:43:27,794
- This is so crazy, when did you--

1020
00:43:27,794 --> 00:43:28,877
- Stand back.

1021
00:43:29,853 --> 00:43:31,160
You stand back.

1022
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,080
Everybody stand by this
row, or I'll kill myself.

1023
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,670
Don't make one fucking move.

1024
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,240
- That's a new twist on
an old Hollywood line.

1025
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,750
- Bonnie, put the gun down,
please, that's enough.

1026
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,050
Bonnie?

1027
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:41,130
That gun is loaded.

1028
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:43,849
You're gonna put, put the gun down now.

1029
00:43:43,849 --> 00:43:44,705
Just put it down.

1030
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:46,180
Put the gun down.

1031
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,330
- [Bonnie] You shut up.

1032
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,340
- Hey, if you're not gonna shoot anybody,

1033
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,141
I'm gonna go get Luis to toss me a steak.

1034
00:43:52,141 --> 00:43:54,078
(gun firing)

1035
00:43:54,078 --> 00:43:56,670
(cross-yelling)

1036
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:59,230
- Come on, what do you got
raging hormones, or what?

1037
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:01,040
- I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to pull the trigger.

1038
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,790
- Yeah, well the gun's
got a light touch, okay,

1039
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:04,290
just ask my dad.

1040
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:05,220
- I thought he was dead?

1041
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,053
- He is.

1042
00:44:06,053 --> 00:44:08,480
- Bonnie put the gun, point
the gun down, will ya?

1043
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,313
- Shut up.

1044
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,040
- You are a scary sight.

1045
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,140
Pregnant women never kill themselves.

1046
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,449
- You call your wife on
your fucking wave right now.

1047
00:44:16,449 --> 00:44:17,360
- Remember it's got a light touch.

1048
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,720
- Bonnie, put the gun down.

1049
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,360
Come on, there's gonna be
cops here and everything.

1050
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,193
- Her number's right inside.

1051
00:44:21,193 --> 00:44:22,890
You want me to go get it for you?

1052
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:24,100
I can go get it, you can call.

1053
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,950
- If you've got the number,
then he's got the number.

1054
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:28,040
You just don't want to
dial it, do you Bobby?

1055
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,330
- No I don't as a matter of fact,

1056
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:30,520
I want us to go back to the hotel

1057
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,730
and forget about this insanity.

1058
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:33,670
- Bonnie, take it from an expert,

1059
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:35,490
don't do this kind of thing drunk.

1060
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:36,490
- Shut up, Benjamin.

1061
00:44:37,448 --> 00:44:38,500
You want me to shoot you again.

1062
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,950
- No, definitely not, definitely not.

1063
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:40,925
- If I want to kill myself,

1064
00:44:40,925 --> 00:44:41,758
I'm gonna make sure I'm damn well

1065
00:44:41,758 --> 00:44:43,640
drunk enough to do it, okay?

1066
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,010
- Why don't we just go eat?

1067
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:45,843
Okay?

1068
00:44:45,843 --> 00:44:47,160
And then you can decide to kill yourself,

1069
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,710
or me, or Bobby, or anyone
else, on a full stomach.

1070
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:53,660
- What's it gonna be, Bobby, huh?

1071
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,740
- All right, okay, I'm calling,

1072
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,153
I'm gonna call, okay?

1073
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,953
I'm calling, put the
gun down, point it down.

1074
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,153
I'm calling.

1075
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:08,140
I'm calling Vee.

1076
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:09,503
Here I go, Vee.

1077
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,570
Oh hi Vee, it's me,

1078
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:16,730
give me a call on my cell
phone when you get this, okay?

1079
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:17,563
Bye.

1080
00:45:21,512 --> 00:45:24,845
(dark orchestral music)

1081
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:31,970
- Great, great, great.

1082
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:33,205
Let's go eat, come on.

1083
00:45:33,205 --> 00:45:35,872
(phone ringing)

1084
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,313
- Hello?

1085
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:44,950
Oh, hi Vee.

1086
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,600
Good of you to get back so quick.

1087
00:45:47,637 --> 00:45:49,393
No, where are you?

1088
00:45:51,289 --> 00:45:55,140
Me, I'm over at the guy's
house who found my cell phone.

1089
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,490
We need to talk.

1090
00:45:57,490 --> 00:45:59,340
Yeah, I need to talk to you, tonight.

1091
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:01,430
Oh, you do?

1092
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:03,970
You got that dinner thing, I'm
sorry, I forgot about that.

1093
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,020
Can I?

1094
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:06,381
No, I can't, I can't.

1095
00:46:06,381 --> 00:46:07,810
(gun firing)

1096
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:09,020
- [Vee] Bobby!

1097
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:11,903
- I think that was a car exhaust thing.

1098
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:14,560
Vee?

1099
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,010
All right, I gotta give
it to you straight.

1100
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:19,800
Vee, I've been seeing another woman.

1101
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,540
Her name is Bonnie Jacobs.

1102
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:26,500
She's pregnant with my child,
and I'm gonna marry her, so,

1103
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,590
that's it for you and me,

1104
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:28,980
we're gonna have to get a divorce, right?

1105
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:29,813
We've been talking about it,

1106
00:46:29,813 --> 00:46:31,290
now we're gonna have to do it.

1107
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:35,160
I'm gonna go over to her hotel right now,

1108
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,073
and I'm gonna call you later, goodbye.

1109
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:41,067
You got me too, look.

1110
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:45,369
- I can't believe you did it.

1111
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:46,247
I can't believe you did it.

1112
00:46:46,247 --> 00:46:47,413
- Yes, I did, for you.

1113
00:46:48,669 --> 00:46:49,569
- Oh Bobby, Bobby.

1114
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:51,603
- You okay now?

1115
00:46:51,603 --> 00:46:54,020
- I fucking can't believe it.

1116
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,598
- Maybe I should take
that gun for you there.

1117
00:46:56,598 --> 00:46:57,431
- No, I'll take the gun.

1118
00:46:57,431 --> 00:46:58,690
I'll take the gun, you know why?

1119
00:46:58,690 --> 00:46:59,580
Because you're a little bit unstable.

1120
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,770
- [Bonnie] Yeah, I love you.

1121
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:03,697
I love you, thank you.

1122
00:47:03,697 --> 00:47:05,193
Thank you for calling.

1123
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:09,043
- You're right, you were right.

1124
00:47:09,043 --> 00:47:10,070
You were right, now
we're gonna go now, okay?

1125
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:10,903
- Okay.

1126
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:14,980
- You go on in and get cleaned up.

1127
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:16,666
Get straightened out and

1128
00:47:16,666 --> 00:47:18,310
we're gonna leave in a minute.

1129
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:20,253
And, Luis.

1130
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:27,350
Go on downstairs and get the cash box.

1131
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:29,050
Why don't you step into my office?

1132
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:34,560
You haven't had enough of this?

1133
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,513
- No.

1134
00:47:46,629 --> 00:47:48,890
- All right, I've got
about 2000 dollars in cash.

1135
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:49,723
All right?

1136
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:53,960
5000, I've got 5000 in cash.

1137
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,120
Take it, and maybe in a week or two,

1138
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,212
there'll be some more payments.

1139
00:47:59,212 --> 00:48:00,610
- I don't know, Bob.

1140
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:03,080
I mean I got you and slim here on the hook

1141
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,493
for a lot more than that.

1142
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:07,103
Why don't we say this?

1143
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:09,600
You go home,

1144
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,990
and you leave Luis here,
and he can be my driver

1145
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:14,723
for the next year, or 20.

1146
00:48:17,298 --> 00:48:18,470
- Are you crazy?

1147
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:20,823
You're just plain old
fuckin' crazy, right?

1148
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,680
Ten grand, all the
money that I have on me,

1149
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,806
right now, right here, ten grand.

1150
00:48:31,806 --> 00:48:34,400
I give you 10,000 dollars and
you call this whole thing off?

1151
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,423
Maybe more later.

1152
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:38,420
Deal?

1153
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,380
- Two words, Bob.

1154
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:42,633
National Inquirer.

1155
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:46,650
- [Bob] You win.

1156
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:49,340
But enough is enough for one day, right?

1157
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:50,840
Okay, so I'm gonna go home,

1158
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,673
you're gonna call me.

1159
00:48:51,673 --> 00:48:52,930
You have my number.

1160
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,430
- I got all your numbers, Bob.

1161
00:48:58,220 --> 00:48:59,120
- Come on, Bonnie.

1162
00:49:00,902 --> 00:49:02,820
(phone ringing)

1163
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:04,350
- Hello?

1164
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:05,573
- It's me, Bonnie.

1165
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,283
- Who is Bonnie?

1166
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:10,150
- Your husband's pregnant lover.

1167
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:12,703
- Excuse me?

1168
00:49:13,651 --> 00:49:16,540
- [Bonnie] He just told you on the phone.

1169
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,373
- Who is this?

1170
00:49:18,808 --> 00:49:22,620
What are you doing, spying on
my husband's private calls?

1171
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:25,050
- Didn't you just talk
to him on the phone?

1172
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:29,180
- Yeah, we were talking, I
heard a bang, got disconnected.

1173
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:30,330
- Oh.

1174
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:31,333
- Who is this?

1175
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:43,143
Is this my husband's new assistant?

1176
00:49:44,195 --> 00:49:45,028
You know what, sweetheart?

1177
00:49:45,028 --> 00:49:45,861
You're fired.

1178
00:49:45,861 --> 00:49:47,520
- No, no listen you bitch,

1179
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,440
I am three months' pregnant

1180
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,597
with the child of your husband, okay?

1181
00:49:51,597 --> 00:49:54,638
And he claims he's going back
to New York with me, tonight.

1182
00:49:54,638 --> 00:49:56,058
- [Vee] Is this a joke?

1183
00:49:56,058 --> 00:49:56,891
- No.

1184
00:49:56,891 --> 00:49:58,500
- Is he there?

1185
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:02,120
Put him on the god damn phone.

1186
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,493
- Okay, okay, I will.

1187
00:50:04,493 --> 00:50:06,410
Just hold on a second.

1188
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:07,413
- Bonnie, come on.

1189
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:12,740
- It's for you, Bobby.

1190
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:13,603
Here, say hello.

1191
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:15,833
- Hello?

1192
00:50:15,833 --> 00:50:17,910
- [Vee] Is it true, you fucking asshole?

1193
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:19,130
- Vee?

1194
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:20,870
What are you doing on this line?

1195
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:22,420
Hold on, a second.

1196
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,820
What did you tell her?

1197
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:26,973
- I can't believe that I really
thought you would call her.

1198
00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:28,950
- Hi Vee.

1199
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:31,200
- I'm gonna cut your dick off.

1200
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,580
I'm gonna stick it in a fucking jar,

1201
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:34,933
and I'm gonna put it in
the freezer, you pig.

1202
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:38,930
- No, you don't want to do that.

1203
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:40,540
- 5400 Aspen Drive,

1204
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:41,417
apartment six.
- No no no no, don't.

1205
00:50:41,417 --> 00:50:43,603
- Come to the party, bye.

1206
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:50,537
- That was a bad thing to do.

1207
00:50:50,537 --> 00:50:53,204
(phone ringing)

1208
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,120
- Donnie?

1209
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:57,953
It's Vee.

1210
00:50:58,885 --> 00:51:01,713
I need you and somebody else to meet me.

1211
00:51:01,713 --> 00:51:03,883
- You are such a scumbag.

1212
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:08,138
- Now that was no way to
end a 15 year old marriage.

1213
00:51:08,138 --> 00:51:09,550
- Well, there probably
aren't too many ways,

1214
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:10,990
but that sure isn't one of them.

1215
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:11,910
- How can I ever trust you

1216
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:13,887
if you do something as
despicable as that, Bobby?

1217
00:51:13,887 --> 00:51:15,670
- Honey, I'm doing the best I can.

1218
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:16,503
- That's a crock of shit.

1219
00:51:16,503 --> 00:51:17,670
- Hey, you guys,

1220
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:18,920
should I throw another steak on?

1221
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:19,757
Is she coming or what?

1222
00:51:19,757 --> 00:51:21,600
- You gotta be kidding me.

1223
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,100
- Bonnie, Bobby, that's it.

1224
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:24,570
I want you guys to sit down,

1225
00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:25,480
and think this thing through,

1226
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,790
while Luis and I go dine inside.

1227
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:27,623
- Oh, shut up.

1228
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:30,390
- When I start sounding like
your marriage counselor,

1229
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:31,490
you're in big trouble.

1230
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,561
- Do you want me to drive you
somewhere, Mister Devillin?

1231
00:51:35,561 --> 00:51:36,394
- No.

1232
00:51:36,394 --> 00:51:38,962
I want you to go back down,

1233
00:51:38,962 --> 00:51:41,953
and make sure that Vee
never gets up those stairs.

1234
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:51,110
- Bobby, I need to talk to you alone.

1235
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:52,050
- Why don't we just go down to the limo?

1236
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:53,860
I'll meet you down there in five minutes.

1237
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,241
- Absolutely not, I want to meet Vee.

1238
00:51:56,241 --> 00:51:58,130
- Well, I could call her from the limo,

1239
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:00,430
we could arrange to meet
her at the hotel bar.

1240
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,990
- You promise you'll come
back to New York with me,

1241
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:04,070
no matter what?

1242
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:05,280
- I promise.

1243
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,270
- Yeah, you promise?

1244
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:08,440
- As fast as humanly possible.

1245
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,273
- All right.

1246
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:13,970
- Cut.

1247
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:15,453
I believed it, I believed it.

1248
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:20,483
- Dickie, here's to you,
for calling it like it is.

1249
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,780
By the way, sorry about your door.

1250
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:26,870
- [Dickie] Oh don't mention
it, I rent the place.

1251
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:28,000
- You'll keep in touch?

1252
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,433
- [Dickie] I have your numbers.

1253
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:31,863
- Be there in a minute.

1254
00:52:38,945 --> 00:52:42,278
(dark electronic music)

1255
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:01,060
Okay, Dickie.

1256
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:03,220
There's 10,000 dollars in
the box on the railing.

1257
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:04,720
That ought to cover it.

1258
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,170
- Wow, that's a lot of cash Bob.

1259
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:07,810
You always carry around that much?

1260
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:09,200
- Only when I'm shooting a film.

1261
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,643
Sorry, all the parts are cast.

1262
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:14,730
- That's okay, Bob.

1263
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:17,110
I don't want to be in one
of your stupid movies.

1264
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:19,282
It would ruin my street cred, you know?

1265
00:53:19,282 --> 00:53:20,490
- You know Dickie, one word of advice.

1266
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:21,323
You really ought to learn

1267
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:23,160
when to (speaking in foreign language).

1268
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,610
- I'll remember that
when I do my interview

1269
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:26,570
for Oui magazine.

1270
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:28,110
- Okay, I'll be in touch.

1271
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:29,840
- Bob, you don't have my numbers.

1272
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,463
- So far, somehow, that
hasn't been the problem.

1273
00:53:36,565 --> 00:53:40,482
(speaking in foreign language)

1274
00:53:47,521 --> 00:53:50,354
(soft jazz music)

1275
00:54:00,062 --> 00:54:02,145
- Hello, Missus Devillin.

1276
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,462
- Okay, hold on, hold on.

1277
00:54:05,462 --> 00:54:07,466
I'll tell you when, okay.

1278
00:54:07,466 --> 00:54:08,299
Go.

1279
00:54:20,522 --> 00:54:22,000
Okay thanks, that's enough.

1280
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:22,833
Okay bye.

1281
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,993
Luis, where are they?

1282
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:33,823
Is he alone?

1283
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:38,403
- No, he's with the person
who found his cell phone.

1284
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:42,780
- Is he with another woman?

1285
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:45,910
- No he, no he,

1286
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:48,083
I didn't see no other person up there.

1287
00:54:58,746 --> 00:55:01,413
(phone ringing)

1288
00:55:03,082 --> 00:55:03,915
Hello?

1289
00:55:03,915 --> 00:55:06,238
- Luis, it's me.

1290
00:55:06,238 --> 00:55:07,830
Say, ola Pedro.

1291
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:09,320
- Ola Pedro.

1292
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,290
- Okay great,

1293
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:12,718
listen is there any way you
can distract Vee long enough

1294
00:55:12,718 --> 00:55:14,290
for me to make a break for it?

1295
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:15,930
- No no, that's impossible.

1296
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:17,803
- Uh huh, that's Bobby, give it to me.

1297
00:55:20,496 --> 00:55:21,777
(speaking in foreign language)

1298
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:24,170
- I'm so sorry, no speak
English, sorry, bye bye.

1299
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:25,003
Bye bye.

1300
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:29,943
- Thank you.

1301
00:55:29,943 --> 00:55:31,200
Come on you guys.

1302
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,803
- Hey hey hey, no.

1303
00:55:32,803 --> 00:55:35,053
(shouting)

1304
00:55:47,799 --> 00:55:50,120
Geez, she brought reporters.

1305
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,380
She's trying to kill me in the press.

1306
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:52,600
I'm doomed, thanks.

1307
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,800
- Bob, you can stay as long as you like.

1308
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,230
- Look, I'm afraid that's impossible.

1309
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:57,150
Is there another exit?

1310
00:55:57,150 --> 00:55:58,650
- No, that's the only way out.

1311
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:01,610
- Oh man.

1312
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:03,310
Maybe I'll luck out and
she'll have a heart attack

1313
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:04,790
on those stairs.

1314
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:07,600
- I don't know Bob, she looks
pretty determined to me.

1315
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,070
- Please do me a favor, okay?

1316
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:10,761
Turn off all these surveillance cameras,

1317
00:56:10,761 --> 00:56:11,594
it's the least you can do.

1318
00:56:11,594 --> 00:56:12,427
- Bob.

1319
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:16,453
Fine, I'm sick of this family anyway.

1320
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:19,999
(men shouting)

1321
00:56:27,104 --> 00:56:28,260
- Hey Vee, I'm ready.

1322
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,940
You gonna make it up here or not?

1323
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:31,060
- Don't start.

1324
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:32,910
I will murder you.

1325
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:34,752
How could you do this to me again?

1326
00:56:34,752 --> 00:56:37,335
(men shouting)

1327
00:56:47,732 --> 00:56:48,565
Screw you, you bastard.

1328
00:56:48,565 --> 00:56:49,440
It's true isn't it?

1329
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,853
- I am not shouting.

1330
00:56:51,699 --> 00:56:52,532
- Is this her place?

1331
00:56:52,532 --> 00:56:55,360
- No, no no no, it's my place.

1332
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,950
Hi Vivian, would you like an iced tea?

1333
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:58,670
- It's Vee, no thanks.

1334
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:00,600
- What about a beer, or a margarita?

1335
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,877
You know, Where Were You
When, that's a great show.

1336
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:04,490
- Oh,

1337
00:57:04,490 --> 00:57:05,990
how are those margaritas?

1338
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:06,970
- I like them.

1339
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:08,540
A star sighting, right here in LA,

1340
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:10,157
what do you think of that?

1341
00:57:10,157 --> 00:57:12,483
- Have I um, have I met you before?

1342
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:14,493
- No.

1343
00:57:15,673 --> 00:57:17,963
- I think I will take
one of those margaritas.

1344
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:23,237
Whose glass is this?

1345
00:57:23,237 --> 00:57:25,470
- I don't know Vee, I don't
know every friend Dickie has,

1346
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:26,410
comes up to his deck.

1347
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:28,010
I've only been here an hour.

1348
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:28,843
- Cheers.

1349
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,193
Oh hey.

1350
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:38,360
- I'm Bonnie Jacobs, and I am
carrying your husband's baby.

1351
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,123
- Bonnie, are you sure?

1352
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,740
- Yes, I'm sure.

1353
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:47,700
- Bobby, we're just gonna have
to do another DNA analysis,

1354
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,210
before we take one more step further.

1355
00:57:50,210 --> 00:57:52,350
- You know Vee, unlike
you and your husband,

1356
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:53,663
I don't fool around.

1357
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:58,720
- You are so stupid if
you think he is gonna fly

1358
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,946
off to never never land
with you, kissing your feet.

1359
00:58:00,946 --> 00:58:01,779
- [Bob] Vee.

1360
00:58:01,779 --> 00:58:03,583
- Do you know his track record?

1361
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:05,763
- Vee.

1362
00:58:05,763 --> 00:58:08,040
- You know, it doesn't
matter, because we're in love.

1363
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,463
- Oh, oh ho ho.

1364
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:12,200
What have you been telling her, Bobby?

1365
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,250
- Vee, that's enough.

1366
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:17,420
- I suppose you aren't an actress.

1367
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:19,230
- No, I'm not, I'm an
entertainment lawyer.

1368
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:22,290
- Oh, an entertainment
lawyer, that's handy,

1369
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,963
because he lost two sexual
harassment cases in the last--

1370
00:58:24,963 --> 00:58:26,720
- Okay Vee, we're not gonna
stand around and do this,

1371
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:27,553
now are we?

1372
00:58:27,553 --> 00:58:28,440
- No shouting.

1373
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,450
What did you tell her?

1374
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:30,860
- Well, I'm sure Bonnie
knows that I've done

1375
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:33,400
my fair share of fooling
around, who cares, big woo.

1376
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,233
All right?

1377
00:58:34,233 --> 00:58:36,020
I mean come on, the fact
is that she is pregnant.

1378
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:38,010
She got pregnant and I
thought that I should

1379
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:39,600
stand by her, right?

1380
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,070
I mean, you know, I
should do my fair share.

1381
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:43,060
She wants to have the baby,

1382
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:44,910
so I told her that I would marry her.

1383
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:46,893
- What a minute, who asked you?

1384
00:58:46,893 --> 00:58:48,843
You make it sound like I pressured you.

1385
00:58:49,695 --> 00:58:51,770
- I felt obligated to ask.

1386
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:52,660
- Really?

1387
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:55,433
Well maybe I felt obligated to accept.

1388
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,630
- So we are planning to
move to New York City,

1389
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:02,503
where I am starting a little film.

1390
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:04,810
- I'm sorry Bonnie,

1391
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:08,966
I've just heard this a
million times before.

1392
00:59:08,966 --> 00:59:11,530
He is not gonna divorce
me, he can't afford to.

1393
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:13,820
This is an interesting margarita, Dickie.

1394
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:16,950
- You know Vee, if you ask me,
your marriage is worthless.

1395
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:18,970
- You know, I haven't asked you.

1396
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:21,120
- Does anyone mind if I
took a drive with Luis,

1397
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,040
my new chauffeur?

1398
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,563
- No, Luis stays.

1399
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:25,543
- Okay.

1400
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:29,630
Bonnie, you want to go inside
with me and cut some limes?

1401
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:30,830
- Yeah, I think I would.

1402
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:37,370
- I cannot believe you've done this again.

1403
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:38,203
I can't believe it.

1404
00:59:38,203 --> 00:59:39,383
- It was a total mistake.

1405
00:59:39,383 --> 00:59:40,216
- You are such a liar.

1406
00:59:40,216 --> 00:59:41,400
- That's not true, I have told you,

1407
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:42,800
I have always told you.

1408
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:43,633
- You told me what?

1409
00:59:43,633 --> 00:59:45,250
That she's pregnant?
- The condom broke.

1410
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:46,083
I know.

1411
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:47,560
- Oh my, this is such bullshit.

1412
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:48,393
- It happened.

1413
00:59:48,393 --> 00:59:49,610
- Don't get near me.

1414
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:50,930
It happened.

1415
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:52,373
- No, she is not the only,

1416
00:59:52,373 --> 00:59:53,750
she is the total--

1417
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:56,995
- We should cut your nuts off.

1418
00:59:56,995 --> 00:59:59,578
(men shouting)

1419
01:00:05,663 --> 01:00:09,163
I'm just sick of seeing these sluts, slut.

1420
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:14,000
- Listen to them long enough,
anyone would commit suicide.

1421
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,660
- Tell me, what should I do?

1422
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:18,760
What a load of shit, the condom broke?

1423
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,610
I don't think so.

1424
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:22,550
You know, I knew this
was gonna be a mistake,

1425
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:25,618
and he told me that he
wanted to have a baby and,

1426
01:00:25,618 --> 01:00:28,302
I thought it was gonna be different.

1427
01:00:28,302 --> 01:00:29,430
- We always think it'll be different.

1428
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:30,630
- And the way he described

1429
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:33,230
our UN-style marital negotiations.

1430
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:34,300
- You'd better get back out there

1431
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,700
before they decide your
fate over a checkbook.

1432
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,290
- Do you think that she
brought the paparazzi

1433
01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:40,470
to score points in the divorce court?

1434
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,670
- Probably.

1435
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:42,883
- That fucking bitch.

1436
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:49,030
- Come on Vee, just try to
be reasonable about this.

1437
01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:50,390
- [Vee] Lake Tahoe is mine.

1438
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:51,573
Santa Barbara is mine.

1439
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:54,290
You can have Hawaii.

1440
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:56,417
- Hawaii? That's no good.

1441
01:00:56,417 --> 01:00:58,567
You know that that
hurricane ruined Hawaii.

1442
01:01:00,136 --> 01:01:01,653
Hey this stuff isn't bad.

1443
01:01:01,653 --> 01:01:02,486
Try one.

1444
01:01:06,548 --> 01:01:07,381
Good?

1445
01:01:07,381 --> 01:01:08,214
- Pretty good.

1446
01:01:08,214 --> 01:01:09,047
- Good?

1447
01:01:09,047 --> 01:01:09,880
- It's fine.

1448
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:11,663
- You know what?

1449
01:01:11,663 --> 01:01:12,830
Excuse me.

1450
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:15,343
Bobby has about two
minutes to make a decision.

1451
01:01:21,068 --> 01:01:23,640
- You have a certain glow about you.

1452
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:24,473
- Thank you.

1453
01:01:24,473 --> 01:01:26,423
It's nice that someone
finds me attractive.

1454
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:29,190
- Of course you're attractive,

1455
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:31,083
pregnant women are always attractive.

1456
01:01:32,596 --> 01:01:37,596
- You know what, fuck you.

1457
01:01:37,697 --> 01:01:39,500
- Do you believe in life cycles?

1458
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:40,681
- What?

1459
01:01:40,681 --> 01:01:42,450
- You know, the fax machine of life,

1460
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:45,310
continuing one cycle to the next,

1461
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:49,130
repeating, feeding,
generation after generation.

1462
01:01:49,130 --> 01:01:49,963
- No.

1463
01:01:51,010 --> 01:01:52,480
No I don't believe in that.

1464
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:55,853
- My son never met me,

1465
01:01:57,644 --> 01:01:58,863
and I never met my dad,

1466
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:01,410
until the week before he died.

1467
01:02:02,970 --> 01:02:04,223
- You know Bobby and I,

1468
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:06,970
we've been seeing each other five years.

1469
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:09,600
And I moved to New York last fall

1470
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,343
to force him to make a decision.

1471
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:15,510
Then he came at Easter.

1472
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:16,393
I got pregnant.

1473
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:20,253
And here we are.

1474
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:34,770
- I should have gone to Paris.

1475
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:36,420
- Who gets Luis?

1476
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,685
- Mister Devillin,

1477
01:02:37,685 --> 01:02:38,518
your cell phone is off.

1478
01:02:38,518 --> 01:02:40,373
Tom on the line, he's
been trying to reach you.

1479
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:42,563
- Tom?

1480
01:02:42,563 --> 01:02:44,090
Tom tom.

1481
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:46,240
Oh, this is the worst
day of my life, ever.

1482
01:02:48,010 --> 01:02:50,030
Yeah, but Tom listen okay,

1483
01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:51,920
we're co-producing on this, right?

1484
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,930
This is just a funny accent.

1485
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:55,610
Think Fargo.

1486
01:02:55,610 --> 01:02:56,730
And besides, I mean you know,

1487
01:02:56,730 --> 01:02:58,930
once you start blasting
helpless animals in Africa,

1488
01:02:58,930 --> 01:02:59,860
drunk out of your mind,

1489
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,610
everybody's gonna know who you are.

1490
01:03:03,515 --> 01:03:04,820
Tom?

1491
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:05,750
Tom?

1492
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:06,583
Come on, I can't believe that

1493
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:08,603
you've got a problem playing Hemingway.

1494
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,453
Yeah.

1495
01:03:13,234 --> 01:03:14,389
(Bonnie clearing her throat)

1496
01:03:14,389 --> 01:03:16,080
I'll get right back to you.

1497
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,230
- So?

1498
01:03:17,230 --> 01:03:18,180
What's it gonna be?

1499
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,263
- Hmm, pushy broad.

1500
01:03:25,093 --> 01:03:26,800
You know you never last with them.

1501
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,300
You should know by now, Bobby.

1502
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:31,863
- Bonnie, come on.

1503
01:03:31,863 --> 01:03:33,700
This is a life-shattering decision.

1504
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:36,790
I can't just make it on
the spot, just like that.

1505
01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:39,130
- Bonnie, what he's
really trying to say is

1506
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:40,800
the last broad he knocked up,

1507
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:43,320
thought it was a bad career move.

1508
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,710
She was a model.

1509
01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:46,360
He got lucky.

1510
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,043
I paid for the abortion.

1511
01:03:48,043 --> 01:03:49,953
- Look who's talking, huh?

1512
01:03:49,953 --> 01:03:52,603
Because of you, we can't
hire a straight limo driver.

1513
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:55,540
And besides Bonnie,

1514
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:58,653
the financial implications are horrific.

1515
01:03:59,820 --> 01:04:01,390
- You know what, you just don't understand

1516
01:04:01,390 --> 01:04:03,770
what a 15 year marriage is.

1517
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:07,160
What, have you been in
love for six months?

1518
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:09,213
- No, five years.

1519
01:04:14,516 --> 01:04:17,179
- Well you know what, you
look really great now,

1520
01:04:17,179 --> 01:04:18,943
but as soon as that baby pops out,

1521
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:20,823
he'll dump you.

1522
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:23,330
- Come on, Bonnie.

1523
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:24,370
I love you.

1524
01:04:24,370 --> 01:04:25,610
Please, try to understand.

1525
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:26,443
- You know what I understand,

1526
01:04:26,443 --> 01:04:27,650
it's what a fuck you are, Bobby.

1527
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:28,750
That's what I understand.

1528
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:29,583
Get away from me.

1529
01:04:29,583 --> 01:04:30,416
- Bonnie, please.

1530
01:04:30,416 --> 01:04:31,249
Calm down.

1531
01:04:33,084 --> 01:04:34,634
- What happened to that window?

1532
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:40,390
- That's my Robert De Niro impersonation

1533
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:42,260
got a little out of hand, earlier today,

1534
01:04:42,260 --> 01:04:43,933
and I shot it out.

1535
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,170
- You have a gun?

1536
01:04:47,170 --> 01:04:48,003
- I had a gun.

1537
01:04:48,003 --> 01:04:50,070
It was an heirloom of my father's,

1538
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:52,903
but Bob took it away from me.

1539
01:04:53,830 --> 01:04:54,663
- Bobby,

1540
01:04:55,610 --> 01:04:57,490
you have his gun now?

1541
01:04:57,490 --> 01:04:59,970
- Yes, I do Vee, in a nice safe place.

1542
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:02,940
- You can keep it actually,
I'm not a big gun guy.

1543
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:04,990
It was an antique Colt derringer,

1544
01:05:04,990 --> 01:05:07,570
very small, gamblers used it.

1545
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,190
My dad was a gambler, you know,

1546
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:11,190
he gambled everything,

1547
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:14,083
including knocking my
mom up when she was 17.

1548
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:18,300
His bad luck was my good fortune, I guess.

1549
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:19,870
- You know what?

1550
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:21,090
I always carry a gun,

1551
01:05:21,090 --> 01:05:22,393
in my handbag, mm-hmm.

1552
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:27,520
No carjacker's gonna take
my Mercedes away, huh?

1553
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:29,770
You can be damn sure of that.

1554
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:32,200
- Okay Vee, that's great.

1555
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:33,190
Could you put that away?

1556
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:34,285
- You want something to eat?

1557
01:05:34,285 --> 01:05:35,650
You know the grill's still hot.

1558
01:05:35,650 --> 01:05:36,837
- No thanks.

1559
01:05:36,837 --> 01:05:37,910
- [Dickie] Do you want a margarita?

1560
01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:38,850
- You know what?

1561
01:05:38,850 --> 01:05:40,160
I can help myself.

1562
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:42,190
- Okay, do you guys want a drink?

1563
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:43,283
- No, thanks.

1564
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:50,430
- You know, I do feel
like I've met you before.

1565
01:05:50,430 --> 01:05:52,150
- Oh, no no no, I don't think so.

1566
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:56,420
- Yes, I never forget a face
I've interviewed, do I Bobby?

1567
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:57,623
- No Vee, you don't.

1568
01:05:58,610 --> 01:05:59,443
- Not me.

1569
01:06:03,571 --> 01:06:04,404
- ER.

1570
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:07,760
ER.

1571
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,980
ER, that's it, that's it.

1572
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:12,570
You were the new doctor on ER.

1573
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:13,550
Am I right?

1574
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:14,470
Am I right, huh?

1575
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:17,600
- Season '97, you got me, uncle.

1576
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:18,573
You happy now?

1577
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:20,910
- I knew it.

1578
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:22,100
I knew it.

1579
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:22,933
You were the guy that had

1580
01:06:22,933 --> 01:06:25,483
that big fight with George Clooney.

1581
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:29,760
- He was hogging the camera on my lines.

1582
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:32,290
- Well, you were the new kid on the block.

1583
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:33,340
- Yeah well, so what?

1584
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:35,093
That had it in for me,

1585
01:06:35,093 --> 01:06:36,470
they were out to get me from day one.

1586
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:38,210
The producers didn't like
me, the wrote me out,

1587
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:39,373
like three episodes.

1588
01:06:40,532 --> 01:06:41,365
- [Bob] Whoa, Luis.

1589
01:06:41,365 --> 01:06:42,850
- [Dickie] Hey Luis, long time no see.

1590
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:43,683
What do you want?

1591
01:06:43,683 --> 01:06:45,490
A steak, or a pinata?

1592
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:46,730
- No.

1593
01:06:46,730 --> 01:06:48,030
Iced tea, please.

1594
01:06:48,030 --> 01:06:48,863
Please.

1595
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:51,973
They no budgie, to be talking to.

1596
01:06:52,897 --> 01:06:55,800
She paid 'em a thousand
dollars holding fee.

1597
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:56,633
- What?

1598
01:06:56,633 --> 01:06:58,840
- She paid him a thousand
dollars holding fee.

1599
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:01,760
- Yep, Bobby, so why don't
you just offer them two grand,

1600
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,230
get them to leave, huh?

1601
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:05,453
- Why don't I just slit my throat?

1602
01:07:06,650 --> 01:07:08,400
- I go wait on the steps.

1603
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,360
Vee, do you need anything?

1604
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,320
- Besides a real husband?

1605
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,333
No thanks.

1606
01:07:14,892 --> 01:07:16,770
- [Bob] What would you
do with anything real?

1607
01:07:16,770 --> 01:07:19,840
- Listen, why don't you kids vamoose?

1608
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:23,323
I got my kabbalah mixer
in about 20 minutes.

1609
01:07:24,792 --> 01:07:25,810
- Wait a minute, you the same guy

1610
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:27,510
that was gonna kill himself a minute ago?

1611
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:30,000
We can't go anywhere yet,
at least not until dark.

1612
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,040
- Two seconds ago you were
eager to get out the door, Bob.

1613
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:35,050
- Two seconds ago, there
weren't any photographers

1614
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:36,333
on your front steps.

1615
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:39,100
- Well maybe I should go talk to them,

1616
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:39,970
I'm good with people.

1617
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:40,803
- Oh yeah,

1618
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:44,460
you're the Oprah of
personal relationships.

1619
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:45,810
That's why I have your gun.

1620
01:08:00,700 --> 01:08:04,330
- I told Luis to go downstairs
and see what they'll need,

1621
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:05,163
to leave.

1622
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:08,193
Now, get rid of the girl.

1623
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:10,350
- It's Bonnie, Vee.

1624
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:15,073
- The girl leaves, the
photographers leave.

1625
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:17,830
- Why did you do this, huh?

1626
01:08:17,830 --> 01:08:18,663
Why?

1627
01:08:18,663 --> 01:08:20,320
Do you realize what you've done?

1628
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:22,960
Do you realize that these
guys would sell their soul

1629
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:26,260
for even a smattering of the
squabble that's going on here?

1630
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:27,093
- Squabble?

1631
01:08:28,090 --> 01:08:29,560
You call this a little squabble?

1632
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:30,939
- Yeah, I call this a little squabble?

1633
01:08:30,939 --> 01:08:32,012
- Bonnie, what do you think?

1634
01:08:32,012 --> 01:08:33,250
What do you think, Bonnie?

1635
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:35,040
Do you think this is a little squabble?

1636
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:36,890
- I'd say it's just one big nasty boil,

1637
01:08:36,890 --> 01:08:38,580
that's gonna fester for years,

1638
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:39,990
and we're not gonna
solve anything right now,

1639
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:42,950
so why don't you just get on out?

1640
01:08:42,950 --> 01:08:44,800
You want a drink for the road, huh?

1641
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:45,633
Last call?

1642
01:08:45,633 --> 01:08:46,466
- Yeah.

1643
01:08:46,466 --> 01:08:47,299
I do.

1644
01:08:47,299 --> 01:08:48,730
I'm having a great time.

1645
01:08:48,730 --> 01:08:49,893
- You're a monster.

1646
01:08:52,850 --> 01:08:54,190
- You know Vee,

1647
01:08:54,190 --> 01:08:56,823
Bobby insisted on not using
any protection with me.

1648
01:08:58,330 --> 01:09:01,283
He wanted the baby with me.

1649
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:04,780
- What are you doing?

1650
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:06,999
Why are you doing it again?

1651
01:09:06,999 --> 01:09:08,078
- I thought I'd have another--

1652
01:09:08,078 --> 01:09:10,300
- I should have let you off yourself.

1653
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:13,060
I fucking hate your guts.

1654
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:14,790
You were two minutes from death.

1655
01:09:14,790 --> 01:09:16,240
You didn't want me to call 911.

1656
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,073
- It was error, Vee.

1657
01:09:17,073 --> 01:09:18,250
- You didn't want me to.

1658
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:19,610
The doctor said you were a goner

1659
01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:20,700
if I'd waited two more minutes.

1660
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:22,171
- Vee!

1661
01:09:22,171 --> 01:09:23,140
Will you?

1662
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:26,620
- He gets very suicidal
when he's stressed.

1663
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:27,870
Honey, you should know this about him.

1664
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:29,170
He is a nightmare.

1665
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:30,920
- I can see why, living with you.

1666
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:34,343
- You do not get Tahoe, or Malibu.

1667
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:37,823
Let me just tell you something, dear girl.

1668
01:09:39,010 --> 01:09:41,520
We put all the property in my name,

1669
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,740
a couple of years ago.

1670
01:09:42,740 --> 01:09:43,573
- Really?

1671
01:09:43,573 --> 01:09:46,923
- When an actor died on the
set of his movie, Bloodstain,

1672
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:50,073
just in case he had to declare bankruptcy.

1673
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:56,080
He is not worth what they
say in the papers, I am.

1674
01:09:56,350 --> 01:09:57,183
- You know something Vee?

1675
01:09:57,183 --> 01:09:59,263
I don't give a shit, take it all.

1676
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:02,140
- I'm done.

1677
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:03,520
I've had enough fun for tonight.

1678
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:05,320
Party's over, I'm calling my lawyer.

1679
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:08,260
- You're not going anywhere.

1680
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:09,093
- Put me down.

1681
01:10:09,093 --> 01:10:09,926
No.

1682
01:10:09,926 --> 01:10:12,039
- [Bob] Come on.
- [Vee] No.

1683
01:10:15,984 --> 01:10:17,484
- I'm out of here.

1684
01:10:25,433 --> 01:10:28,650
- I guess that's what they mean
by a physical relationship.

1685
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:30,240
- You know, that is a different man

1686
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:32,130
than the one that I know.

1687
01:10:32,130 --> 01:10:33,793
- Welcome to reality TV, Bonnie.

1688
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:38,293
- I'm going back to New York, alone.

1689
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:40,113
- What do you mean alone?

1690
01:10:40,113 --> 01:10:43,143
Like totally, no abortions.

1691
01:10:44,690 --> 01:10:45,640
- I don't need one.

1692
01:10:47,004 --> 01:10:49,150
I had a miscarriage last week.

1693
01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:50,270
Yeah.

1694
01:10:50,270 --> 01:10:52,083
Before last Tuesday I was huge.

1695
01:10:54,870 --> 01:10:57,003
I came out here, to tell Bobby, you know.

1696
01:10:58,533 --> 01:11:00,900
To see if he still wanted to marry me.

1697
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:02,553
I never even got a chance to ask.

1698
01:11:03,891 --> 01:11:05,741
Well, I guess I got my answer, right?

1699
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,563
I really loved Bobby.

1700
01:11:10,710 --> 01:11:13,123
- That's so dumb, you
might as well love a worm.

1701
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:16,870
- [Bob] Vee, what are you doing?

1702
01:11:16,870 --> 01:11:17,913
I want to talk.

1703
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:24,640
- Oh, and then there was
the other woman, Karen,

1704
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:26,613
who he was seeing after I was pregnant.

1705
01:11:27,730 --> 01:11:29,710
I just had to confront him.

1706
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:36,623
- Is there any chance you
would have dinner with me?

1707
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:39,223
- No.

1708
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:41,940
No.

1709
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:43,430
You know, can you call me a cab?

1710
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:44,263
- Sure.

1711
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:46,513
- Vee.

1712
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:51,220
Oh man, I'm gonna strangle you.

1713
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:53,020
What the hell, Vee!

1714
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:54,200
Put that down.

1715
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:55,900
What is this?

1716
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:57,050
Come on now, Vee.

1717
01:11:57,050 --> 01:11:58,150
What, are you kidding?

1718
01:12:02,290 --> 01:12:03,440
- Do you have cab fair?

1719
01:12:09,710 --> 01:12:12,260
I never wanted anything from Bobby.

1720
01:12:12,260 --> 01:12:13,460
- It's called blackmail.

1721
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:17,290
- Not when he is the guilty party,

1722
01:12:17,290 --> 01:12:19,340
asking me to suppress
incriminating evidence.

1723
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:20,720
- What are you talking about?

1724
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:23,760
- 5400 Aspen Drive, apartment six.

1725
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:24,910
We'll look out for you.

1726
01:12:25,990 --> 01:12:26,903
Hey Luis.

1727
01:12:27,769 --> 01:12:29,035
- Everything all right?

1728
01:12:29,035 --> 01:12:29,868
Where's Bob?

1729
01:12:29,868 --> 01:12:31,015
Where's Bobby?

1730
01:12:31,015 --> 01:12:31,848
Vee?

1731
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:33,250
- Actually everything is not all right.

1732
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:34,390
Listen, did Bobby go jogging with

1733
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:35,640
anyone?
- Never mind me.

1734
01:12:36,523 --> 01:12:38,671
- I don't know, I didn't drive him.

1735
01:12:38,671 --> 01:12:40,020
- You know that is bullshit, Luis.

1736
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:43,370
He went jogging with Karen
this afternoon, didn't he?

1737
01:12:43,370 --> 01:12:44,203
- I don't know.

1738
01:12:44,203 --> 01:12:45,410
I didn't pick him up until four o'clock.

1739
01:12:45,410 --> 01:12:47,180
- He did, she came up from behind him

1740
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:48,150
while he was on the cell phone,

1741
01:12:48,150 --> 01:12:49,170
giving me some lame excuse

1742
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:50,590
of why he couldn't pick
me up at the airport.

1743
01:12:50,590 --> 01:12:52,650
She must have grabbed the
phone, thrown it in the bush.

1744
01:12:52,650 --> 01:12:53,880
I heard the whole thing.

1745
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:56,083
- That explains how I
found it in the bush.

1746
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,340
- They're no answering their cell phone.

1747
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:03,093
- Luis, she wants to know if
you assaulted me earlier today.

1748
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:07,520
See, now I got surveillance
cameras everywhere.

1749
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:08,910
I got it all on tape.

1750
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:10,060
- Surveillance cameras?

1751
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:12,900
- Okay.

1752
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:13,733
Okay look.

1753
01:13:16,952 --> 01:13:19,306
- Hey, that's the girl.

1754
01:13:19,306 --> 01:13:20,139
- Turn around.

1755
01:13:20,139 --> 01:13:21,510
- Smile babe, I'll make you famous.

1756
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:22,923
- Okay, okay look.

1757
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:27,247
I stuck it in with the
photographers, okay?

1758
01:13:27,247 --> 01:13:29,260
So what you want me to do?

1759
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:31,620
You want me to go knock
on the door, or what?

1760
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:32,620
- No, you know what, I wouldn't do that.

1761
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:35,683
Luis, can you please drive me
to the airport okay please?

1762
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:42,373
- Okay, okay okay okay okay.

1763
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,850
I go back downstairs,

1764
01:13:45,850 --> 01:13:46,823
I pay them off,

1765
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:49,993
and I be back in a minute, okay?

1766
01:13:51,695 --> 01:13:52,845
It better be here, too.

1767
01:13:53,770 --> 01:13:55,263
- [Dickie] I didn't take
any of your money man.

1768
01:13:57,844 --> 01:13:59,644
- I hate your guts, and your stairs.

1769
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:04,700
- Dickie you crazy motherfucker.

1770
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:05,590
- Hi, Darlene.

1771
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:06,840
Thank you for coming too.

1772
01:14:08,725 --> 01:14:11,310
- Oh, what the fuck is she doing here?

1773
01:14:11,310 --> 01:14:13,743
Dickie, I want the gun back right now.

1774
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:17,980
- The man you hear
screaming in the bathroom,

1775
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:19,200
he has the gun.

1776
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:21,300
- Benjamin, why does she want your gun?

1777
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:22,133
- Benjamin?

1778
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:28,380
Because this asshole
sent me a suicide note

1779
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:29,543
in the mail today.

1780
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:33,330
I don't trust you anymore.

1781
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:34,680
Go get the gun.

1782
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:36,583
- He won't give it to me.

1783
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:39,473
- I did that.

1784
01:14:40,410 --> 01:14:42,940
- Oh, target practice?

1785
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:45,480
Get the guy out here now.

1786
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:47,767
I want the gun.

1787
01:14:47,767 --> 01:14:51,360
- For the moment, Bobby
does not think Bonnie, or I,

1788
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:54,790
are qualified to operate a handgun.

1789
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:57,620
You will probably have to get it yourself.

1790
01:14:57,620 --> 01:14:59,493
- How is this a stag party?

1791
01:15:00,410 --> 01:15:03,413
Yeah, I heard it was disgusting.

1792
01:15:04,410 --> 01:15:06,010
You look like you haven't slept.

1793
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:10,340
You know Gina?

1794
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:12,163
Yeah, she knows all about us,

1795
01:15:13,570 --> 01:15:16,010
and she won't fuck her soon-to-be husband,

1796
01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:18,160
till he has an AIDS test.

1797
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:19,543
- That's not a bad idea.

1798
01:15:20,773 --> 01:15:24,106
(Vee and Bobby arguing)

1799
01:15:25,675 --> 01:15:28,720
I have a camera in the bathroom.

1800
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:29,573
- You're sick.

1801
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:38,493
- No, maybe not.

1802
01:15:38,493 --> 01:15:40,057
- Come on Dickie, stop fucking around.

1803
01:15:40,057 --> 01:15:41,500
- I gave Bobby my word.

1804
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:42,880
- Oh like you give a shit about Bobby.

1805
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:45,170
Look at what he did, come on just do it.

1806
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:50,210
- I'm off, and will you put that down?

1807
01:15:50,210 --> 01:15:51,960
This is ridiculous,
you're not gonna kill me.

1808
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,460
- Jesus.

1809
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:55,360
Dickie, who the fuck are these people?

1810
01:15:57,016 --> 01:15:57,849
- No.

1811
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,373
- What the fuck is going on in there?

1812
01:16:02,987 --> 01:16:05,033
- Don't you say a fucking
thing about this gun.

1813
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:08,863
Shut the fuck up and go away.

1814
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:12,960
Tell that slut to get out of here.

1815
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:13,880
- No.

1816
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:15,040
I won't.

1817
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,930
- You know, Bobby says
she's a certified nutcase.

1818
01:16:16,930 --> 01:16:18,620
I'd better just shut my mouth right now.

1819
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:20,690
- Yeah, I'd shut your mouth, too.

1820
01:16:20,690 --> 01:16:22,646
- [Bonnie] Who asked you?

1821
01:16:22,646 --> 01:16:23,730
- Now will you put that down?

1822
01:16:23,730 --> 01:16:25,516
You're not gonna kill me.

1823
01:16:25,516 --> 01:16:26,650
- Huh, partners?

1824
01:16:26,650 --> 01:16:27,970
- No.

1825
01:16:27,970 --> 01:16:30,080
- You've been trying to kill me for years.

1826
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:33,090
So why don't you just pull
out Dickie's gun and shoot me?

1827
01:16:33,090 --> 01:16:37,486
You might as well, I've given
you the best years of my life.

1828
01:16:37,486 --> 01:16:38,800
And you're gonna dump me now?

1829
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,143
- Jesus Dickie, why did
you give him the gun?

1830
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:47,252
- I'm like a walking double cliche,

1831
01:16:47,252 --> 01:16:49,250
an ex-trophy wife.

1832
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:50,410
- What shall we do?

1833
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:51,410
- Maybe we should call Luis,

1834
01:16:51,410 --> 01:16:53,180
he's probably their 24 hour shrink.

1835
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:54,620
- You know what, she's
cold, she could do it.

1836
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:55,743
Give me the phone.

1837
01:16:56,990 --> 01:16:58,910
Give me the phone.

1838
01:16:58,910 --> 01:17:01,132
Give me the phone, God.

1839
01:17:01,132 --> 01:17:03,799
(phone dialing)

1840
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:06,980
Luis, yeah, listen listen,

1841
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:08,970
we have a situation up
here, it's really important,

1842
01:17:08,970 --> 01:17:10,970
it's an emergency, come up here now, okay?

1843
01:17:10,970 --> 01:17:11,803
All right, bye.

1844
01:17:11,803 --> 01:17:12,940
He's coming, but you know what?

1845
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:14,130
We can't wait for him.

1846
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:14,963
Come on, do something here.

1847
01:17:14,963 --> 01:17:16,793
Come on, Dickie do something.

1848
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:21,063
- Hey Vee, I can see you.

1849
01:17:22,670 --> 01:17:24,040
Woo.

1850
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:25,290
- Shut up Dickie.

1851
01:17:25,290 --> 01:17:26,190
- [Bob] I love you.

1852
01:17:26,190 --> 01:17:29,650
- Take that cow back
wherever she came from.

1853
01:17:29,650 --> 01:17:31,990
- Vee, I got a camera,

1854
01:17:31,990 --> 01:17:33,300
above the shower.

1855
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:36,000
I can see everything that's going on.

1856
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:39,160
- Perfect.

1857
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:41,880
- I'd rather be perfect than a murderer.

1858
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:44,320
Go ahead, go ahead, wave the gun around.

1859
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:45,693
Wave it around.

1860
01:17:48,416 --> 01:17:49,766
- Don't shoot me, but move.

1861
01:17:53,421 --> 01:17:54,580
- Way to go, Dickie.

1862
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:58,930
- Yeah, too bad, I've been
recording it all along.

1863
01:17:58,930 --> 01:18:00,020
- Okay okay, what happened?

1864
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:01,370
- Oh my God, thank God Luis.

1865
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:02,750
She's pulled a gun on him in the bathroom,

1866
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:03,900
you gotta do something.

1867
01:18:06,104 --> 01:18:07,125
- Have you called the police?

1868
01:18:07,125 --> 01:18:08,220
- No, I didn't call the police.

1869
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:10,420
- Okay well, good good good.

1870
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:13,020
Okay okay okay, here.

1871
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:14,620
This to bring her to her senses.

1872
01:18:15,730 --> 01:18:16,563
She in there?

1873
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:20,096
Vee, Bobby,

1874
01:18:20,096 --> 01:18:21,370
it's Luis.

1875
01:18:21,370 --> 01:18:22,880
I calling 911,

1876
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:24,970
so Vee put the gun down,

1877
01:18:24,970 --> 01:18:28,020
come out, wait wait wait.

1878
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:30,733
Hey operator, can you hold for one second?

1879
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:33,999
Vee, I've got them on the line.

1880
01:18:33,999 --> 01:18:35,499
- Well put 'em on.

1881
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:40,460
- Vee, take a pill and chill out.

1882
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:42,093
- Fuck you, Luis.

1883
01:18:43,997 --> 01:18:45,497
- You see how she speak to me?

1884
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:49,850
Hey number one,

1885
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:51,907
could you hold for one more second longer?

1886
01:18:51,907 --> 01:18:52,870
I'm trying to determine

1887
01:18:52,870 --> 01:18:55,284
whether we have a 911 situation or not.

1888
01:18:55,284 --> 01:18:57,250
Okay, thanks.

1889
01:18:57,250 --> 01:19:00,640
Vee, I only trying to help you.

1890
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,390
Bobby isn't even worth it.

1891
01:19:02,390 --> 01:19:04,047
- He tried to strangle me.

1892
01:19:04,047 --> 01:19:07,070
I'd call that spousal
abuse, wouldn't you, Luis?

1893
01:19:07,070 --> 01:19:09,160
- Okay, okay okay okay.

1894
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:11,990
But you remember when Bobby knocked up

1895
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:13,340
that model three years ago?

1896
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:15,900
You didn't kill him then.

1897
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:18,470
You thought about it, but you didn't.

1898
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:20,550
So you won't kill him now, Vee.

1899
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:22,540
Put the gun down.

1900
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:25,580
- Don't fucking move.

1901
01:19:25,580 --> 01:19:27,400
- This is idiotic.

1902
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:30,230
This is a terrible, suicidal career move.

1903
01:19:30,230 --> 01:19:31,278
Come on I can't let you--

1904
01:19:31,278 --> 01:19:32,171
- No!

1905
01:19:32,171 --> 01:19:35,250
(gun firing)

1906
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:36,420
- Okay, I'm out of here.

1907
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:37,910
- No no no, you can't
leave, you can't leave.

1908
01:19:37,910 --> 01:19:39,360
You're a witness to a felony.

1909
01:19:40,590 --> 01:19:41,423
- You hit me.

1910
01:19:41,423 --> 01:19:43,100
- [Vee] Oh, no no no.

1911
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:44,210
- You hit me.

1912
01:19:44,210 --> 01:19:45,679
Jesus.

1913
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:47,541
Vee, what the?

1914
01:19:47,541 --> 01:19:49,103
- Luis, get an ambulance.

1915
01:19:49,103 --> 01:19:50,033
I'm still on hold with 911.

1916
01:19:50,033 --> 01:19:51,220
Is it bad, Bobby?

1917
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:52,730
- Yes yes yes.

1918
01:19:52,730 --> 01:19:55,340
- No, Luis don't call
an ambulance, I'm okay.

1919
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:57,433
Don't call the police, don't
bring the police in here.

1920
01:19:57,433 --> 01:20:00,820
- Vee, Vee, listen listen to me, okay?

1921
01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:04,890
If I say the ambulance
is for a gunshot victim,

1922
01:20:04,890 --> 01:20:06,683
the police automatically come out.

1923
01:20:06,683 --> 01:20:09,820
- We want to quit now Vee,
while we're still ahead, right?

1924
01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:11,370
Or at least while you're ahead.

1925
01:20:12,315 --> 01:20:14,140
I can go to Doctor Richardson,
he can patch me up.

1926
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:17,213
We don't have any need for
any emergency room drama.

1927
01:20:18,490 --> 01:20:20,980
- You know, I think he
wants to bleed to death.

1928
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:23,760
Ha ha ha, okay, his choice.

1929
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,514
- Vee, you got 30 seconds.

1930
01:20:26,514 --> 01:20:28,450
Hi operator,

1931
01:20:28,450 --> 01:20:30,597
could you hold one moment longer?

1932
01:20:30,597 --> 01:20:31,764
Oh, thank you.

1933
01:20:32,930 --> 01:20:35,120
- Vee, do you know how stupid you look?

1934
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:37,340
You don't want this tape
turned into police evidence.

1935
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:39,680
You know it's gonna end up all over TV.

1936
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,010
What do you say, I give you the hard disk

1937
01:20:41,010 --> 01:20:43,389
and we call it square, what do you say?

1938
01:20:43,389 --> 01:20:45,080
- [Vee] Fuck you Dickie.

1939
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:46,400
He jumped me.

1940
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:48,453
I want the world to see it.

1941
01:20:48,453 --> 01:20:50,490
- People have been saying,
fuck you Dickie, my whole life.

1942
01:20:50,490 --> 01:20:52,703
Vee, listen,

1943
01:20:53,610 --> 01:20:55,170
it'll be a clean swap.

1944
01:20:55,170 --> 01:20:56,003
We'll give you the hard drive,

1945
01:20:56,003 --> 01:20:57,803
and you give me the gun, okay?

1946
01:20:59,570 --> 01:21:01,210
Come out, right now,

1947
01:21:01,210 --> 01:21:02,940
are you're gonna end up all over TV.

1948
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:06,120
You'll be the OJ trial of white people.

1949
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:07,683
- Well well.

1950
01:21:08,710 --> 01:21:10,510
- Come on, what do you want from me?

1951
01:21:12,430 --> 01:21:14,063
All right, Bonnie,

1952
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:17,440
you have to go back to the hotel now.

1953
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:18,980
I'll call you later.

1954
01:21:18,980 --> 01:21:20,383
- You've gotta be kidding me.

1955
01:21:27,657 --> 01:21:28,773
- All right now,

1956
01:21:29,649 --> 01:21:31,667
I'm just gonna take the gun because

1957
01:21:32,507 --> 01:21:33,960
I don't trust you.

1958
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:36,400
Just get up, wait can I help you?

1959
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:37,997
Do you need help?

1960
01:21:37,997 --> 01:21:38,913
- You shot me.

1961
01:21:38,913 --> 01:21:39,746
- I'm so sorry.

1962
01:21:39,746 --> 01:21:40,690
I didn't shoot you.

1963
01:21:40,690 --> 01:21:42,293
Don't lean on your arm.

1964
01:21:44,005 --> 01:21:45,851
- Well unfortunately.

1965
01:21:45,851 --> 01:21:46,684
- [Vee] Can you do it?

1966
01:21:46,684 --> 01:21:47,517
- Yes.

1967
01:21:49,361 --> 01:21:51,028
- [Vee] Okay, go go.

1968
01:21:53,969 --> 01:21:55,669
- Don't worry about the mess, Bob.

1969
01:21:58,701 --> 01:22:00,585
- I don't trust you.

1970
01:22:00,585 --> 01:22:01,730
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
I'll get the door for you.

1971
01:22:01,730 --> 01:22:02,620
Hold on.

1972
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:03,670
- Thanks, sweetheart.

1973
01:22:08,613 --> 01:22:09,863
- Go on, go on.

1974
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:14,573
- Hey,

1975
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:17,627
hey, where you going?

1976
01:22:18,970 --> 01:22:19,920
- Guys, come on up.

1977
01:22:24,247 --> 01:22:26,733
- Okay.

1978
01:22:28,730 --> 01:22:30,730
Luis, get off that damn phone, will you?

1979
01:22:31,930 --> 01:22:32,950
- Hey 911, yes.

1980
01:22:34,110 --> 01:22:36,140
Sorry, but we have determined at this time

1981
01:22:36,140 --> 01:22:37,770
that there is no emergency.

1982
01:22:37,770 --> 01:22:38,650
Thank you.

1983
01:22:38,650 --> 01:22:40,290
- Bobby, I can make a tourniquet.

1984
01:22:40,290 --> 01:22:41,260
- [Bob] Can you?

1985
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:42,583
- Yeah, I learned it on ER.

1986
01:22:43,674 --> 01:22:44,507
- Okay.

1987
01:22:44,507 --> 01:22:45,880
Luis, go on down to that bathroom,

1988
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:47,580
and clean up that mess, all right?

1989
01:22:49,636 --> 01:22:51,250
- You know something?

1990
01:22:51,250 --> 01:22:55,190
Vee, Bobby, I have decided
that the two of you

1991
01:22:55,190 --> 01:22:56,333
deserve each other.

1992
01:22:57,930 --> 01:23:00,030
We called a cab, and they're
gonna be here any second.

1993
01:23:00,030 --> 01:23:00,863
I'm on my way.

1994
01:23:00,863 --> 01:23:02,363
- Don't leave now, I just did it.

1995
01:23:03,970 --> 01:23:05,640
I negotiated, yeah.

1996
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:07,610
Come on, this is LA, you
gotta meet me halfway.

1997
01:23:07,610 --> 01:23:08,850
- I'm leaving.

1998
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:09,683
- [Bob] Why?

1999
01:23:09,683 --> 01:23:11,113
Why? Karen?

2000
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,940
What about the model that
you fucked two years ago,

2001
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:16,190
and had the abortion with?

2002
01:23:16,190 --> 01:23:17,930
- You hold on to that,

2003
01:23:17,930 --> 01:23:19,937
and I will hold on to this.

2004
01:23:19,937 --> 01:23:22,120
- No, I will hold on to this.

2005
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:23,140
- No, no no no no no.

2006
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:25,922
This is Sara, you haven't met her yet.

2007
01:23:25,922 --> 01:23:28,460
She's new to the,

2008
01:23:28,460 --> 01:23:31,651
this is Sara, Sara Vee,
Bobby Bobby Vee, Sara.

2009
01:23:31,651 --> 01:23:33,753
Put the knife down honey,
they're nice people.

2010
01:23:35,380 --> 01:23:36,430
- We heard a gunshot.

2011
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:39,620
- Hey Vee, I'll bet you
won't shoot Bobby here,

2012
01:23:39,620 --> 01:23:41,103
with these guys here, right?

2013
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:43,573
- Fellas,

2014
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:46,470
either of you takes a picture,

2015
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:48,172
I have to shoot you.

2016
01:23:48,172 --> 01:23:49,005
- Okay.

2017
01:23:49,005 --> 01:23:49,838
- Okay Vee, no problem.

2018
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:53,310
- Give me the hard drive.

2019
01:23:53,310 --> 01:23:54,640
- What?

2020
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:55,926
Give me the hard drive.

2021
01:23:55,926 --> 01:23:58,510
Don't you have to give me
the gun as part of that deal?

2022
01:23:58,510 --> 01:23:59,610
- Give it to me first.

2023
01:24:02,836 --> 01:24:05,110
- That kind of blows my
leverage, doesn't it?

2024
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:06,456
- That's the way it goes.

2025
01:24:06,456 --> 01:24:08,090
- You know, I don't
even care, I don't care.

2026
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:09,490
You can have the hard drive.

2027
01:24:10,976 --> 01:24:12,863
I'm just gonna give you the hard drive,

2028
01:24:14,628 --> 01:24:16,660
and trust your crazy ass.

2029
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:17,493
Here you go.

2030
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:23,820
Bobby, release that
tourniquet every 20 seconds

2031
01:24:23,820 --> 01:24:24,910
for the next five minutes,

2032
01:24:24,910 --> 01:24:26,930
and every 10 seconds for
every minute after that.

2033
01:24:26,930 --> 01:24:28,680
You can survive for like two hours.

2034
01:24:31,010 --> 01:24:34,350
- Bobby's a royal asshole Dickie.

2035
01:24:34,350 --> 01:24:37,440
Thousands of people would
be cheering if I shot him.

2036
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:38,313
Millions.

2037
01:24:39,550 --> 01:24:40,630
Do you know if agents
are your only friends,

2038
01:24:40,630 --> 01:24:42,680
you know what kind of person you are?

2039
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:43,777
Him, that's the kind of person you are.

2040
01:24:43,777 --> 01:24:45,730
You're in a lot of trouble.

2041
01:24:45,730 --> 01:24:47,330
- So what?

2042
01:24:47,330 --> 01:24:48,640
He's a dick.

2043
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:50,990
Some people are pricks,
some people are assholes.

2044
01:24:50,990 --> 01:24:54,730
You can't shoot a man for
being a plump little smurf.

2045
01:24:54,730 --> 01:24:56,150
You got him in the arm,

2046
01:24:56,150 --> 01:24:59,050
and that's quite enough for
being a dick, don't you think?

2047
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:03,220
- Get out, everybody get out.

2048
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:04,670
- No, no no no no no.

2049
01:25:04,670 --> 01:25:06,510
No one's leaving, it's my house.

2050
01:25:06,510 --> 01:25:09,023
You're not kicking anyone
out of my fucking house.

2051
01:25:09,910 --> 01:25:11,292
Give me the gun.

2052
01:25:11,292 --> 01:25:12,292
- No, uh uh.

2053
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:16,088
- I'm gonna come over
and get the gun, okay?

2054
01:25:16,088 --> 01:25:16,921
- No.

2055
01:25:16,921 --> 01:25:17,810
- You're not gonna shoot me,

2056
01:25:17,810 --> 01:25:19,270
with all these people watching you.

2057
01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:20,710
- Don't come near me, don't--

2058
01:25:20,710 --> 01:25:22,040
- No one's gonna hurt anybody else.

2059
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:23,480
You have the hard drive,
you don't need the gun.

2060
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:24,620
- Don't you dare.

2061
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:25,900
- I'm daring you right now, Vee.

2062
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:26,733
- Don't.

2063
01:25:26,733 --> 01:25:27,603
- Give me the gun.

2064
01:25:28,771 --> 01:25:29,604
- No.

2065
01:25:29,604 --> 01:25:30,610
- Just give me the gun.

2066
01:25:39,023 --> 01:25:39,856
- I have the hard drive.

2067
01:25:39,856 --> 01:25:40,689
You have nothing.

2068
01:25:40,689 --> 01:25:43,270
I have everything, you have nothing.

2069
01:25:43,270 --> 01:25:44,470
- He's so gross.

2070
01:25:44,470 --> 01:25:45,336
- You get it?

2071
01:25:45,336 --> 01:25:47,040
You get it?

2072
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:48,540
Luis, don't fuck with me, man.

2073
01:25:49,660 --> 01:25:52,510
You guys, how much are
those pictures worth?

2074
01:25:52,510 --> 01:25:54,260
- 25.
- No no, 50 grand, total.

2075
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:55,520
- 50 grand?

2076
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:56,930
Okay, okay.

2077
01:25:56,930 --> 01:25:58,530
You guys are fucked,

2078
01:25:58,530 --> 01:26:00,280
because these guys are
gonna publish those photos,

2079
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:01,913
unless you pay them 100 grand.

2080
01:26:02,778 --> 01:26:04,470
A 100 grand, Vee.

2081
01:26:04,470 --> 01:26:05,730
Put your cameras on the table.

2082
01:26:05,730 --> 01:26:06,860
Does that sound okay to you?

2083
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:07,693
- Yeah.

2084
01:26:07,693 --> 01:26:10,330
- Put 'em down, put 'em
down there, right there.

2085
01:26:10,330 --> 01:26:13,000
Okay, so Vee, Bobby,

2086
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,050
you guys are done.

2087
01:26:14,050 --> 01:26:15,870
You're splitting up, okay?

2088
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:18,410
And Bobby, you're not gonna
get shit in this divorce,

2089
01:26:18,410 --> 01:26:20,130
I'm settling for you right here, okay?

2090
01:26:20,130 --> 01:26:20,963
- Dickie.

2091
01:26:20,963 --> 01:26:22,800
- Vee, you get everything
because Bobby here's a schmuck.

2092
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,330
- Wait wait, Dickie,

2093
01:26:24,330 --> 01:26:26,050
this doesn't make any sense.

2094
01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:26,883
- What are you talking about?

2095
01:26:26,883 --> 01:26:27,900
- I'm saying that's a problem here.

2096
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:29,053
- You're supposed to support me.

2097
01:26:29,053 --> 01:26:31,213
A woman is supposed to support the man.

2098
01:26:31,213 --> 01:26:32,683
- Dickie, I'm not your woman.

2099
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:34,873
- What?

2100
01:26:34,873 --> 01:26:36,223
- I told you two weeks ago.

2101
01:26:38,074 --> 01:26:39,737
- Why do you have to say that
in front of all these people?

2102
01:26:39,737 --> 01:26:41,683
Never mind, I'm gonna finish this.

2103
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:47,460
Vee, write these people a check, okay?

2104
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:52,060
Bobby, you get one house, that's it.

2105
01:26:52,060 --> 01:26:53,440
What'll it be.

2106
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,273
- Malibu.

2107
01:26:54,273 --> 01:26:55,106
- No.

2108
01:26:57,300 --> 01:26:59,220
That's the only one without the mortgage.

2109
01:26:59,220 --> 01:27:02,090
- Bobby's getting Malibu, okay?

2110
01:27:02,090 --> 01:27:02,923
It's done.

2111
01:27:02,923 --> 01:27:05,460
Now Vee, you right them a
check, let's all go home.

2112
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:09,400
Let's try and keep our voices down.

2113
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:10,950
Bobby, remember the tourniquet.

2114
01:27:13,950 --> 01:27:14,783
- Okay Bobby.

2115
01:27:17,425 --> 01:27:20,120
If I pay, give me both cameras.

2116
01:27:21,681 --> 01:27:23,640
You cannot blackmail me.

2117
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:24,720
- [Bob] Take it all, Vee.

2118
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:26,010
As long as I have Malibu,

2119
01:27:26,010 --> 01:27:28,400
Bonnie and I can move
in and have the baby.

2120
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:29,850
- If only that were possible.

2121
01:27:30,704 --> 01:27:31,537
- Why not?

2122
01:27:34,930 --> 01:27:37,250
- Oh my God, Dickie don't you dare.

2123
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:39,253
- I had a miscarriage last week.

2124
01:27:42,681 --> 01:27:43,880
- What?

2125
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:45,570
- It's time for departure,

2126
01:27:45,570 --> 01:27:47,830
even when there's no certain place to go.

2127
01:27:47,830 --> 01:27:48,930
- Dickie get down.

2128
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:50,480
- I came here to tell you that.

2129
01:27:55,090 --> 01:27:56,940
I've been trying to tell you all day.

2130
01:27:57,970 --> 01:27:59,080
- Oh my God.

2131
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:01,010
Don't you dare, oh my God.

2132
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:02,811
He fucking jumped.

2133
01:28:02,811 --> 01:28:05,228
(gun firing)

2134
01:28:09,072 --> 01:28:10,689
- Fuck.

2135
01:28:10,689 --> 01:28:12,280
- Dickie?

2136
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:13,113
- [Dickie] Shit.

2137
01:28:16,690 --> 01:28:17,523
- Can you see him?

2138
01:28:17,523 --> 01:28:18,676
- I can't see where he landed.

2139
01:28:18,676 --> 01:28:19,907
- Hey hey hey, fuck off.

2140
01:28:19,907 --> 01:28:23,870
You take one photo, I'll shoot you.

2141
01:28:23,870 --> 01:28:25,650
Somebody call 911.

2142
01:28:25,650 --> 01:28:26,483
- I will.

2143
01:28:26,483 --> 01:28:28,080
- No, don't, what are you doing?

2144
01:28:30,940 --> 01:28:31,773
- Ow.

2145
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:41,740
- I'm going down there,

2146
01:28:41,740 --> 01:28:44,450
and if I see anybody
looking over the edge,

2147
01:28:44,450 --> 01:28:47,883
I swear to God I will shoot your face.

2148
01:28:54,495 --> 01:28:55,958
Dickie?

2149
01:28:55,958 --> 01:28:57,110
Dickie?

2150
01:28:57,110 --> 01:28:57,950
Hey!

2151
01:28:57,950 --> 01:28:59,580
I said, get the fuck back.

2152
01:29:05,959 --> 01:29:08,126
- God, it's still ringing.

2153
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:11,500
- Dickie?

2154
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:12,990
Dickie?

2155
01:29:12,990 --> 01:29:14,270
Dickie?

2156
01:29:14,270 --> 01:29:15,103
Jesus.

2157
01:29:16,820 --> 01:29:17,653
Dickie?

2158
01:29:21,660 --> 01:29:22,713
What the fuck?

2159
01:29:24,527 --> 01:29:25,413
Are you stupid?

2160
01:29:25,413 --> 01:29:26,880
- I think I dislocated my shoulder.

2161
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,963
- I think your dislocated your brain.

2162
01:29:30,340 --> 01:29:31,657
- [Dickie] I just want to
get away from this, you know?

2163
01:29:31,657 --> 01:29:32,490
- Yeah.

2164
01:29:32,490 --> 01:29:34,890
- You want to have some
tofu with me right now?

2165
01:29:34,890 --> 01:29:35,723
- Oh no.

2166
01:29:39,070 --> 01:29:41,887
- I need you, you can't
stop being my friend.

2167
01:29:43,390 --> 01:29:45,263
Come on, I know I know.

2168
01:29:46,142 --> 01:29:47,902
I know you don't want to be my girlfriend,

2169
01:29:47,902 --> 01:29:48,767
but you gotta come out with me.

2170
01:29:48,767 --> 01:29:50,317
You can't stop being my friend.

2171
01:29:52,062 --> 01:29:52,909
- All right.

2172
01:29:52,909 --> 01:29:54,770
All right, all right, all right.

2173
01:29:54,770 --> 01:29:56,840
- I can't go right now because
I gotta go to the doctor,

2174
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:58,030
because I hurt my arm.

2175
01:29:58,030 --> 01:30:00,293
And I think my back.

2176
01:30:01,950 --> 01:30:02,840
- Are you okay?

2177
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:03,710
- Yeah.

2178
01:30:03,710 --> 01:30:04,714
- You're standing.

2179
01:30:04,714 --> 01:30:06,100
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

2180
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:07,550
- Good.

2181
01:30:07,550 --> 01:30:10,790
All right well, it was nice meeting you.

2182
01:30:10,790 --> 01:30:12,310
- Do you want us to give you a ride?

2183
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:13,497
- No thank you.

2184
01:30:14,746 --> 01:30:15,579
Thank you,

2185
01:30:16,450 --> 01:30:18,900
for an interesting day.

2186
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:20,100
Take care of yourselves.

2187
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:21,893
- Bye.

2188
01:30:21,893 --> 01:30:23,440
- You just gonna walk?

2189
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:25,643
- If I have to walk to New York, I will.

2190
01:30:26,609 --> 01:30:28,683
I really gotta go.

2191
01:30:29,554 --> 01:30:30,470
Bye.

2192
01:30:30,470 --> 01:30:31,303
- Bye.

2193
01:30:31,303 --> 01:30:32,136
- Be careful.

2194
01:30:38,321 --> 01:30:40,111
- I think my kneecap's
displaced, actually.

2195
01:30:40,111 --> 01:30:42,000
- I will take you to
the hospital, come on.

2196
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,875
- I, we can't take my car though because.

2197
01:30:43,875 --> 01:30:44,708
- Why?

2198
01:30:44,708 --> 01:30:45,603
- I locked the keys.

2199
01:30:47,369 --> 01:30:49,704
(dog barking)

2200
01:30:49,704 --> 01:30:52,670
Would you like to ride in the limo?

2201
01:30:52,670 --> 01:30:53,623
Stay there.

2202
01:30:59,170 --> 01:31:00,003
Walk this way.

2203
01:31:06,246 --> 01:31:07,079
- How about I drive?

2204
01:31:07,079 --> 01:31:07,912
- Okay.

2205
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:14,873
Yes, madam.

2206
01:31:21,410 --> 01:31:23,260
- We have got to get rid of this gun.

2207
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,100
- Yes, my lady.

2208
01:31:33,264 --> 01:31:34,097
- I'm serious.

2209
01:31:34,097 --> 01:31:34,930
- I know.

2210
01:31:34,930 --> 01:31:36,517
- Okay.

2211
01:31:36,517 --> 01:31:39,190
- [Dickie Voiceover] Most
suicidal people are insomniacs.

2212
01:31:39,190 --> 01:31:40,163
It's true fact.

2213
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:44,343
Number one reason those
people say they're insomniacs.

2214
01:31:44,343 --> 01:31:45,873
- That sounds like the limo.

2215
01:31:45,873 --> 01:31:48,190
- [Dickie] Too afraid
to die in their sleep.

2216
01:31:48,190 --> 01:31:50,403
- We get a carjack, they taking the limo.

2217
01:31:50,403 --> 01:31:52,250
- [Dickie] Which
statistically most people do.

2218
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:54,275
- Someone's taking the limo.

2219
01:31:54,275 --> 01:31:55,108
- Oh my God.

2220
01:31:55,108 --> 01:31:56,643
- You left the keys in the car, I guess.

2221
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:00,930
- [Dickie] All my life, I've been afraid

2222
01:32:00,930 --> 01:32:02,253
to die in my sleep.

2223
01:32:06,370 --> 01:32:09,743
All I want to know is when
that moment is coming.

2224
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:17,340
When my tiny little universe is over.

2225
01:32:24,260 --> 01:32:27,843
(soft acoustic jazz music)
