1
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,434
[Whitey] In every corner
of America,

2
00:01:25,477 --> 00:01:27,305
there's a small town

3
00:01:27,566 --> 00:01:30,482
struggling with people trying
to make a life for themselves.

4
00:01:31,788 --> 00:01:33,268
And this town
ain't no different.

5
00:01:34,225 --> 00:01:35,705
We get up in the morning,

6
00:01:36,184 --> 00:01:37,663
we work hard all day,

7
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,144
and we say our prayers
every night.

8
00:01:41,624 --> 00:01:43,016
But it's not 40 years ago...

9
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,759
and fortunes around here
have been fading fast.

10
00:01:48,457 --> 00:01:50,111
Blessed or cursed,

11
00:01:50,894 --> 00:01:52,113
it was my father...

12
00:01:52,722 --> 00:01:55,028
who won this bar
in a card game

13
00:01:55,072 --> 00:01:56,465
over Blitzer's German bakery.

14
00:01:58,162 --> 00:01:59,511
But lately,
I've been wondering...

15
00:02:00,643 --> 00:02:01,774
whether it's my luck...

16
00:02:02,906 --> 00:02:03,950
her pulse...

17
00:02:04,734 --> 00:02:06,388
or time's magic kiss...

18
00:02:07,258 --> 00:02:08,781
that'll restore her charms.

19
00:02:11,262 --> 00:02:13,134
The friends I've kept
over the years

20
00:02:13,177 --> 00:02:14,222
have stayed the same.

21
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,529
Some would call that noble.

22
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:21,794
To others, it'd be foolish.

23
00:02:23,056 --> 00:02:24,014
But to me,

24
00:02:24,797 --> 00:02:26,190
they're all I've ever known.

25
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,718
There we were,

26
00:02:33,371 --> 00:02:35,591
just five guys going together

27
00:02:35,634 --> 00:02:36,722
in separate directions.

28
00:02:38,289 --> 00:02:40,552
Just trying to work out an understanding of who we are...

29
00:02:41,684 --> 00:02:43,338
and what's best for us in life.

30
00:02:59,528 --> 00:03:01,617
[Bobby] Yeah, Lenny,
I got your page, buddy.

31
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,488
Let me back this out
for you, okay?

32
00:03:03,532 --> 00:03:05,838
Vikings plus ten,
equals at the points,

33
00:03:05,882 --> 00:03:07,057
two dime parlay.

34
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,886
Okay, hot size, both Bears
and Tampa Bay,

35
00:03:10,408 --> 00:03:13,281
four o'clock, you want the Pats
over the 9ers in a pick 'em.

36
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,674
It's two and eighty
gets the spread.

37
00:03:15,718 --> 00:03:16,806
You can't live without it?

38
00:03:18,111 --> 00:03:20,026
Well, I'm not gonna tell
Missy a goddamn thing.

39
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,029
No. Hey, on the off-chance that you come out ahead, buddy,

40
00:03:23,073 --> 00:03:24,422
I still pay off.

41
00:03:24,466 --> 00:03:26,032
One o'clock, Mondays,
The Florentine.

42
00:03:33,823 --> 00:03:35,128
[Paris]
"Bad Ass" Bobby Williams.

43
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:38,131
Moving around like he's got
the whole town on lockdown.

44
00:03:38,436 --> 00:03:39,785
Look at him,

45
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:41,439
filling his ribbon
on the street.

46
00:03:42,179 --> 00:03:44,877
Well, this explains
why my numbers are off.

47
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:46,879
Sheets are down
at the high schools.

48
00:03:48,098 --> 00:03:51,319
Same kid used to book
bets at McManus, right?

49
00:03:51,362 --> 00:03:52,145
That's it.

50
00:03:53,059 --> 00:03:54,670
[Joe] You know, 20 years ago,

51
00:03:54,713 --> 00:03:56,149
you draw on a guy with a rep,

52
00:03:56,193 --> 00:03:57,890
wind up with a second asshole.

53
00:03:57,934 --> 00:04:00,110
Now, every
nailed-back motherfucker

54
00:04:00,153 --> 00:04:01,851
and his brother
make a move on it.

55
00:04:04,897 --> 00:04:06,856
Hey, Pretty. Just the asshole
I wanna see.

56
00:04:06,899 --> 00:04:07,987
What's up, Bob?

57
00:04:08,031 --> 00:04:09,293
Tryin' to make a monkey
out of me?

58
00:04:09,337 --> 00:04:11,034
No. Whatever gave you
that impression?

59
00:04:11,077 --> 00:04:13,036
Well, my wallet for one.
Don't fuck me off.

60
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:14,733
Listen,
I ain't skipping or nothin',

61
00:04:14,777 --> 00:04:16,822
I just got jammed up
with these broads and all.

62
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:18,737
-You know how that goes, right?
-No, not really.

63
00:04:18,781 --> 00:04:19,912
You know,
I wasn't banging broads

64
00:04:19,956 --> 00:04:21,131
a week before my fights.

65
00:04:21,174 --> 00:04:23,568
Listen, it's 2,200
since the final four.

66
00:04:23,612 --> 00:04:25,875
Unless you wanna be picking up
your teeth with broken hands,

67
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:28,356
-I'd pay me.
-I'm not hanging you out,

68
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:29,487
you know that.

69
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:31,315
Listen, I got a purse
coming my way

70
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,838
this week, Friday.

71
00:04:32,882 --> 00:04:34,884
And when it comes, I promise
you'll get a slice of it.

72
00:04:34,927 --> 00:04:36,538
And then we'll really
get moving on things.

73
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:38,322
A big slice,
with all the toppings,

74
00:04:38,366 --> 00:04:40,019
because I'm getting
real hungry these days.

75
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,456
-Okay.
-Oh, and, Pretty,

76
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:43,849
if we're not smooth by Saturday
morning after the fight,

77
00:04:43,893 --> 00:04:45,503
Chloe and Coco
gonna read about it,

78
00:04:45,764 --> 00:04:47,026
if they can.

79
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,289
[tapping on window]

80
00:04:52,162 --> 00:04:53,946
[Joe] So he overplayed
his hand.

81
00:04:54,425 --> 00:04:55,818
No big deal.

82
00:04:55,861 --> 00:04:58,342
He don't know that the price
of poker just gone up.

83
00:04:59,648 --> 00:05:00,649
[Frankie] Hey, Whitey,

84
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:04,174
do you know what the eighth
wonder of the world is?

85
00:05:05,262 --> 00:05:07,308
Frankie, I don't know.

86
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:09,092
Let me guess.

87
00:05:09,397 --> 00:05:10,311
The electric...

88
00:05:11,877 --> 00:05:13,096
target pussy.

89
00:05:13,357 --> 00:05:14,358
No.

90
00:05:14,402 --> 00:05:16,099
But I like the way
you're thinking.

91
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,103
No, my friend,
it is compound interest.

92
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,802
That's the...

93
00:05:25,282 --> 00:05:26,675
That's the great invention
you want to tell me about?

94
00:05:26,718 --> 00:05:27,893
[Frankie] Part of it.

95
00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:30,679
Okay. So, here's what
I was thinking.

96
00:05:31,767 --> 00:05:34,552
Say, you and me,
throwing our lots in together,

97
00:05:34,596 --> 00:05:37,816
get us a small stake,
I'm thinking a few grand, right?

98
00:05:38,295 --> 00:05:40,906
We'll lay it out on the street
for a percentage.

99
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,212
Soft loads.

100
00:05:43,822 --> 00:05:45,258
I'm thinking maybe a deuce a
week, you know, keep it working.

101
00:05:46,216 --> 00:05:48,653
Push it back out,
whack it back up,

102
00:05:48,697 --> 00:05:51,656
do you have any idea
how much fuckin' money

103
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,963
you and I would have
after five years?

104
00:06:00,578 --> 00:06:01,536
Don't move your head.

105
00:06:02,145 --> 00:06:03,146
What?

106
00:06:03,581 --> 00:06:04,974
You know why?

107
00:06:05,017 --> 00:06:06,845
-[Frankie] Huh?
-Well, I figure

108
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:08,804
if you tilt it over
to one side or the other,

109
00:06:08,847 --> 00:06:10,153
your fucking brain's
gonna fall out.

110
00:06:10,196 --> 00:06:11,241
[Frankie chuckles] Fuck.

111
00:06:11,284 --> 00:06:13,025
[laughs]

112
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:14,462
Look, man,
the fucking vig alone

113
00:06:14,505 --> 00:06:15,985
will eat your kids,
look at that.

114
00:06:16,507 --> 00:06:19,249
Um, did you do all this stuff
for Molly,

115
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:21,643
for the wedding,
you ordered the flowers?

116
00:06:21,686 --> 00:06:22,992
[Frankie] Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I--

117
00:06:23,035 --> 00:06:24,297
-The altar?
-[Frankie] Listen.

118
00:06:24,602 --> 00:06:26,387
My cousin Dukie's girlfriend,

119
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,997
she got a piece of an FTD,

120
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,302
she's gonna give 'em to us
at a cost.

121
00:06:29,346 --> 00:06:30,956
So Wednesday before the wedding,
we go over there

122
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,436
like a pack of fucking monkeys.

123
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,742
Pick that place quick.

124
00:06:34,351 --> 00:06:35,831
I do appreciate it.

125
00:06:35,874 --> 00:06:37,833
Take a big load off my mind.

126
00:06:38,486 --> 00:06:39,574
-Thanks, Frankie.
-[glasses clink]

127
00:06:39,617 --> 00:06:40,749
Anytime.

128
00:06:41,053 --> 00:06:43,229
I mean that.
You can count on me.

129
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,450
What's up Whitey's ass
with this wedding?

130
00:06:46,494 --> 00:06:48,234
They come together,
it's a last-minute affair.

131
00:06:48,278 --> 00:06:50,454
[Truby] He's gone for a long
throw on it, you know.

132
00:06:50,498 --> 00:06:52,151
Jack ain't got two nickels
lumped together.

133
00:06:52,195 --> 00:06:53,718
And for Whitey,
it's his only sister.

134
00:06:53,762 --> 00:06:55,677
-You know how he is.
-[Bobby] He's from a tribe.

135
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,721
Right, keeps his people.

136
00:06:58,201 --> 00:06:59,855
Why in the world would Whitey
wanna hire Cozy for this

137
00:06:59,898 --> 00:07:02,510
-fucking wedding anyway?
-I don't know. He's traditional,

138
00:07:02,553 --> 00:07:04,729
-he's Catholic.
-Yeah, he's Catholic, all right.

139
00:07:04,773 --> 00:07:06,644
He was at The Last Supper,
he just didn't stick around

140
00:07:06,688 --> 00:07:08,037
-for the picture.
-[Truby chuckles]

141
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,299
Let me run a name through
your meter,

142
00:07:09,342 --> 00:07:11,432
tell me what you think.
Nicky Napolitano.

143
00:07:11,475 --> 00:07:13,259
-Fucking Victor Moon.
-[Bobby] Exactly,

144
00:07:13,303 --> 00:07:14,304
without the paycheck.

145
00:07:15,914 --> 00:07:16,349
He's the young Dean Martin,
he knows how to carry himself.

146
00:07:17,046 --> 00:07:17,873
Is Nicky expensive?

147
00:07:19,048 --> 00:07:20,615
[Bobby] Yeah.
He owes me heavy, though.

148
00:07:20,658 --> 00:07:21,659
I'd get him at a bargain.

149
00:07:22,878 --> 00:07:23,792
[whipped cream squirting]

150
00:07:26,925 --> 00:07:29,101
The apron, that's Ms. Fuck Eyes?

151
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,497
Okay.
Can I just tell you things?

152
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:36,457
You know, they're really...
heading that way.

153
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,110
I'm bringing that
to the wedding.

154
00:07:39,547 --> 00:07:40,156
Oh, yeah.

155
00:07:41,505 --> 00:07:43,376
But I still have
to ask her, but...

156
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,248
[Bobby] I don't mean
to pull your cards, Truby.

157
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:47,555
What do you know
from love, you know?

158
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:50,035
A broad like that,
who knows what she wants?

159
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:52,864
A guy with a car?
Someone to smack her around?

160
00:07:52,908 --> 00:07:54,387
Money with a big dick?

161
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:56,259
Dangerous for a guy like you.

162
00:07:56,302 --> 00:07:59,262
Bobby, I'm trying to date her,
not outwit her.

163
00:07:59,305 --> 00:08:02,134
She ain't a cyclops.
She's, what? A counter waitress.

164
00:08:02,613 --> 00:08:04,049
How hard is that?

165
00:08:04,572 --> 00:08:07,139
[Bobby] Broad like that
is a fucking nightmare.

166
00:08:07,183 --> 00:08:09,098
You know what she's good at?
Walking,

167
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:10,926
because she ain't stopped
for two fucking seconds

168
00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:12,188
since I got here.

169
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,191
Oh.

170
00:08:16,453 --> 00:08:18,542
Bobby, did you--
Did you hear of Teddy Finn?

171
00:08:18,586 --> 00:08:21,284
All right. Okay, my mother's
at the 6:30 every day,

172
00:08:21,327 --> 00:08:22,981
Father Quill lets out with,
"Teddy Finn's

173
00:08:23,025 --> 00:08:24,983
-coming back to town."
-The altar boy?

174
00:08:25,027 --> 00:08:26,985
-You gotta be kidding me.
-[Truby] No, that's what I hear,

175
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:28,291
I guess things
didn't work out for him.

176
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:29,597
He's supposed to be heading
back east.

177
00:08:31,076 --> 00:08:31,903
You don't think he knows
Molly's getting married, do you?

178
00:08:32,904 --> 00:08:34,210
I don't know.

179
00:08:34,993 --> 00:08:36,125
[Bobby] You didn't tell Whitey?

180
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:37,996
What are the odds of that?

181
00:08:38,344 --> 00:08:39,389
What are the odds
that motherfucker

182
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:40,521
blowing into town now?

183
00:08:40,564 --> 00:08:41,913
Teddy fucking Finn.

184
00:08:43,915 --> 00:08:46,178
[sighs] Okay...

185
00:08:46,483 --> 00:08:47,223
Oh.

186
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:49,921
Oh, my God. Look at this.

187
00:08:50,313 --> 00:08:51,183
I can't believe this.

188
00:08:52,358 --> 00:08:54,099
-[Brenda scoffs]
-And guest.

189
00:08:54,143 --> 00:08:55,753
-And stripper.
-[Vikki scoffs]

190
00:08:55,797 --> 00:08:56,754
[Brenda] He's got balls.

191
00:08:57,581 --> 00:08:58,539
Who?

192
00:08:58,843 --> 00:09:00,628
Your Uncle Danny's
bringing his...

193
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,282
dancer friend.

194
00:09:03,326 --> 00:09:06,416
-Exotic dancer.
-[Molly] Oh, my God.

195
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:07,722
Where are we gonna seat them?

196
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,594
Well, why don't we put them
at Trisha's table?

197
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:12,857
No, because Mike and Kelly
are sitting there

198
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:14,206
and she's Jonie's cousin

199
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,121
and we won't get through
the salad course

200
00:09:16,165 --> 00:09:17,601
before Michael starts in
on them.

201
00:09:17,645 --> 00:09:19,603
Hey, what do you expect though
when you leave your wife

202
00:09:19,647 --> 00:09:21,997
for some 19-year-old stripper,
what, no one's gonna talk

203
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,390
-about it?
-[Molly] You know, I met her

204
00:09:24,434 --> 00:09:26,828
and she's... She's nice.

205
00:09:27,219 --> 00:09:30,092
I just don't know what she sees
in a creep like that, you know?

206
00:09:30,135 --> 00:09:33,182
Brenda, he's Molly's uncle.

207
00:09:33,225 --> 00:09:34,662
Not by blood.

208
00:09:34,705 --> 00:09:37,273
Yeah, but I was the flower girl
at his wedding, okay?

209
00:09:37,665 --> 00:09:39,580
I was at that wedding, too,
and he hit on me.

210
00:09:39,884 --> 00:09:41,320
[Molly] You were five years old.

211
00:09:41,364 --> 00:09:42,844
[Brenda] I was almost six.

212
00:09:42,887 --> 00:09:44,236
He did not hit on you.

213
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:46,369
You know, you-- Ow!

214
00:09:47,892 --> 00:09:49,372
This is my wedding...
[chuckles]

215
00:09:49,851 --> 00:09:52,810
...and I just want it
to go really well

216
00:09:52,854 --> 00:09:54,029
with no drama.

217
00:09:54,072 --> 00:09:55,857
So, seat them wherever you want

218
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,510
as long as they're far away
from me, okay?

219
00:09:58,555 --> 00:09:59,643
The kiddie table.

220
00:09:59,687 --> 00:10:00,992
[laughs]

221
00:10:01,036 --> 00:10:02,385
[Vikki] He's great
with kids, right?

222
00:10:02,428 --> 00:10:04,779
He's great with kids,
obviously.

223
00:10:05,693 --> 00:10:07,520
Come on, he belongs
at the kiddie table.

224
00:10:07,956 --> 00:10:10,523

[Teddy] Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

247
00:11:20,942 --> 00:11:24,336
I haven't confessed
in, uh, 100 years.

248
00:11:24,989 --> 00:11:26,948
[Father Quill] I haven't heard
that voice in a long time.

249
00:11:27,644 --> 00:11:29,124
Is there anything
you want to talk about?

250
00:11:30,386 --> 00:11:33,476
I'm not having any problems
with the faith or...

251
00:11:34,477 --> 00:11:35,608
impure thoughts...

252
00:11:37,175 --> 00:11:39,264
but if you could call down
a blessing...

253
00:11:40,048 --> 00:11:42,528
I sure could use a...

254
00:11:43,573 --> 00:11:45,531
place to stay for a few days...

255
00:11:46,924 --> 00:11:48,186
and maybe, you know...

256
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:54,323
help out around the church.

257
00:11:55,411 --> 00:11:57,282
The foxes have their holes...

258
00:11:58,544 --> 00:11:59,981
the birds have their nests...

259
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,897
but son of man has nowhere
to lay his head.

260
00:12:03,593 --> 00:12:04,420
Is that it?

261
00:12:06,248 --> 00:12:08,946
Yeah, something like that.
[sighs]

262
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,906
[Father Quill] You still got
that long second toe?

263
00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:13,342
[chuckles]

264
00:12:14,778 --> 00:12:16,562
[Teddy] Yeah. [chuckles]

265
00:12:17,433 --> 00:12:18,390
[Father Quill] Teddy...

266
00:12:19,435 --> 00:12:20,436
Yes?

267
00:12:22,481 --> 00:12:24,092
[Father Quill] Stay here
for as long as you like.

268
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:27,791
Until your heart starts
to beat of the good again.

269
00:12:28,705 --> 00:12:31,360
If you need anything,
just ask.

270
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,231
If it's money...

271
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:35,973
make sure it's only a little.

272
00:12:36,017 --> 00:12:38,584
[Teddy laughs]

273
00:12:39,934 --> 00:12:41,762
[Father Quill] May the peace
of God be with you always.

274
00:12:42,066 --> 00:12:43,851
And also with you.

275

[sobs]

276
00:12:53,034 --> 00:12:55,079
[Bobby] I don't care
where McCollough's line's at.

277
00:12:55,123 --> 00:12:56,689
You gotta honor your bets,
Vinny.

278
00:12:56,733 --> 00:12:58,779
-[phone beeps]
-[Bobby] Where you going?

279
00:12:58,822 --> 00:13:00,955
I'm looking for a quarter
so I can walk a half mile

280
00:13:00,998 --> 00:13:02,695
to use a payphone,
thank you very much.

281
00:13:03,044 --> 00:13:04,610
[beeping]

282
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,613
John? Wexler?
Yeah, yeah.

283
00:13:07,657 --> 00:13:09,006
Hold the line.

284
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,660
-I'll be off in a minute.
-That's what you said

285
00:13:10,703 --> 00:13:11,879
over an hour ago.

286
00:13:11,922 --> 00:13:14,272
I'd appreciate it
if you'd keep your word.

287
00:13:14,316 --> 00:13:16,274
Appreciate-- Well, honey,
that's a 50-center.

288
00:13:16,318 --> 00:13:17,623
You learned that
at night school?

289
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:19,016
I'd appreciate
a lot of shit, too.

290
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,626
You're in, you're out,

291
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,063
you're with this one,
you're with that one.

292
00:13:22,106 --> 00:13:23,455
This fucking wedding's
got everybody's head

293
00:13:23,499 --> 00:13:24,979
-screwed right up their asses.
-[sighs]

294
00:13:25,022 --> 00:13:26,589
Tell you something,
look at this place.

295
00:13:26,632 --> 00:13:28,243
It's like a fucking shit house
in distress.

296
00:13:28,286 --> 00:13:30,114
You know, this fucking wedding
has got nothing to do with this.

297
00:13:30,158 --> 00:13:31,899
I'm busy.
I work 48 hours a week.

298
00:13:31,942 --> 00:13:33,901
It's what's known
as a J-O-B.

299
00:13:33,944 --> 00:13:35,859
Oh. Are we gonna go
over that again?

300
00:13:35,903 --> 00:13:37,774
God forbid.
What'll Mrs. Grundy think?

301
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,341
Let me tell you
something, Vikki.

302
00:13:39,384 --> 00:13:40,603
Regardless of what you think,

303
00:13:40,646 --> 00:13:42,257
there's nothing wrong
with what I do.

304
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,388
-Aha.
-I book a few horses,

305
00:13:43,432 --> 00:13:44,607
I write a few bets

306
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,304
and I cover football
each week.

307
00:13:46,348 --> 00:13:48,437
The big crime in that, honey,
I'm missing.

308
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,482
Sitting judges bet the pros.

309
00:13:50,526 --> 00:13:51,788
Little old ladies
in church hats

310
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,877
with flowers on them,
they play the ponies.

311
00:13:53,921 --> 00:13:56,010
A nice little Irish priest,
they still got their brogues,

312
00:13:56,053 --> 00:13:57,620
they bet the dogs.

313
00:13:57,663 --> 00:13:59,274
-Honey, even the pope plays--
-All right.

314
00:13:59,317 --> 00:14:01,232
No, he does, seriously.

315
00:14:01,276 --> 00:14:02,843
Honey, I hear he doubles up
on Christmas.

316
00:14:02,886 --> 00:14:04,322
You're gonna wind up
in jail, Bob.

317
00:14:04,366 --> 00:14:05,933
[Bobby] Jail, jail,
that's a fucking joke.

318
00:14:05,976 --> 00:14:07,412
They can't even put murderers
in jail.

319
00:14:07,456 --> 00:14:09,240
No, the fucking judges
are too busy

320
00:14:09,284 --> 00:14:10,633
shaking down the lawyers.

321
00:14:11,242 --> 00:14:14,245
Vikki. Vikki!
Goddamn it.

322
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,726
Yeah, John, I'm back.

323
00:14:18,989 --> 00:14:20,730
[Joe] Let me explain
something, Whitey.

324
00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:23,907
I'm not a random creature.

325
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:25,300
I love money...

326
00:14:26,127 --> 00:14:27,171
I love pussy.

327
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,479
I love having
a home field advantage.

328
00:14:32,785 --> 00:14:35,440
Been coming up here
about 30 years

329
00:14:35,484 --> 00:14:36,572
and every time I turn around,

330
00:14:36,615 --> 00:14:38,966
someone's looking
to get over on me

331
00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:41,142
like I'm a fat bag of popcorn.

332
00:14:42,621 --> 00:14:45,537
Look, I hold a note
on this bar.

333
00:14:47,365 --> 00:14:50,978
And as good as your old man was,
he lost it fair and square.

334
00:14:51,021 --> 00:14:52,762
And the arithmetic
that you agreed on

335
00:14:52,805 --> 00:14:54,677
to get it back is all fucked up.

336
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,592
I'm behind, that's a fact.

337
00:14:56,635 --> 00:14:58,681
[Joe] But that ain't for you
to decide on your own.

338
00:14:59,203 --> 00:15:02,728
You don't call shots on check.
The fuck is wrong with you?

339
00:15:03,555 --> 00:15:05,079
If you're a tough guy,
nobody told me.

340
00:15:05,775 --> 00:15:07,690
I'm just trying to get by.

341
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:09,170
I'm trying to get out
from under.

342
00:15:09,997 --> 00:15:12,738
The business is slow,
my sister's getting married.

343
00:15:14,218 --> 00:15:16,481
Maybe you should grab a boost
from that enterprising

344
00:15:16,525 --> 00:15:18,570
young friend of yours, Bobby.

345
00:15:18,962 --> 00:15:21,617
Mr. Badass has just about
hung out his shingle.

346
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,576
Someone should tell that kid

347
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,100
his fucking head's
screwed on crooked.

348
00:15:27,971 --> 00:15:29,755
Look, people still
come here, right?

349
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:30,887
Uh-hmm.

350
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:32,802
You got customers,
they grab a beer,

351
00:15:32,845 --> 00:15:34,195
they read the Funnies.

352
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,067
Pick a horse...

353
00:15:37,111 --> 00:15:39,809
It seems to me you got more
opportunity at meeting people,

354
00:15:39,852 --> 00:15:41,767
customers, than, say,
a guy like me.

355
00:15:41,811 --> 00:15:43,726
Lay off some of this stuff...

356
00:15:44,335 --> 00:15:45,771
and middle it out.

357
00:15:46,381 --> 00:15:47,730
Probably help with all
this bleeding

358
00:15:47,773 --> 00:15:49,210
you got on your hands.

359
00:15:49,253 --> 00:15:51,168
And help towards some
of the money you owe me...

360
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:52,865
wouldn't it?

361
00:15:53,562 --> 00:15:54,998
And maybe I wouldn't--
I wouldn't be

362
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:56,565
as insulted as I am.

363
00:15:57,087 --> 00:15:58,741
Maybe you should call Toby.

364
00:16:00,134 --> 00:16:01,744
He's a fence.

365
00:16:01,787 --> 00:16:04,355
Toby ain't into me
for 12 fucking grand,

366
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,748
Whitey, you are.

367
00:16:08,316 --> 00:16:09,404
Look...

368
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:12,407
I didn't wanna put it
in your ear like this,

369
00:16:13,408 --> 00:16:16,585
but I'm gonna need about $6,000
of the money you owe me.

370
00:16:17,455 --> 00:16:19,588
Else I'll just bust
his fucking joint out.

371
00:16:20,806 --> 00:16:22,156
Up to you, kid.

372
00:16:27,074 --> 00:16:28,640
[man] Thanks.

373
00:16:28,684 --> 00:16:31,817
[indistinct chatter]

374
00:16:36,518 --> 00:16:38,694
-Four or five?
-Five, five.

375
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:41,610
-We're gonna get to the--
-[utensils clatter]

376
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:44,917
Just put that anywhere for now.

377
00:16:45,135 --> 00:16:46,919
[laughter]

378
00:16:48,051 --> 00:16:50,445
Hey, ain't a party
till something is broken, right?

379
00:16:50,967 --> 00:16:53,013
[chuckling]

380
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:55,928
Did my friend and I overhear
you say

381
00:16:55,972 --> 00:16:58,192
you're putting down some gas
line near the old Rockhorn?

382
00:16:58,235 --> 00:16:59,628
Near it? In it.

383
00:17:00,194 --> 00:17:01,499
Who you with, DPA?

384
00:17:01,978 --> 00:17:03,675
Do I look square ass
to you, huh?

385
00:17:05,068 --> 00:17:07,418
No, but Bippy McDuffy
was telling me

386
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,246
that the feds were around,

387
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,032
squeezing the stones
over some lease fees and all.

388
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,946
Bippy McDuffy, huh?

389
00:17:15,992 --> 00:17:17,646
There's a Latin scholar
for you.

390
00:17:18,255 --> 00:17:19,865
Bippy McDuffy?

391
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:23,434
He's a ten-pound bag of shit
in a five-pound bag.

392
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:26,220
And you tell him I said so.

393
00:17:29,092 --> 00:17:31,616
Jimmy fucking Christmas,
I'm funning you, you bastards.

394
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,444
[laughter]

395
00:17:33,488 --> 00:17:34,489
Come on!

396
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,665
[Billy] Bippy McDuffy.

397
00:17:37,405 --> 00:17:39,450
Bippy and I go back
ten, 15 years.

398
00:17:39,494 --> 00:17:40,886
Asshole buddies.

399
00:17:41,278 --> 00:17:42,540
Where is he?

400
00:17:42,584 --> 00:17:43,933
Hey, you tell him
Billy said hi, all right?

401
00:17:44,281 --> 00:17:45,282
No.

402
00:17:46,153 --> 00:17:46,936
Fuck him.

403
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,069
Don't tell him anything.

404
00:17:49,939 --> 00:17:51,375
He'll be there
this afternoon.

405
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:52,637
[Billy] Where is that?

406
00:17:52,681 --> 00:17:53,856
By the quarry.

407
00:17:55,205 --> 00:17:59,470
Off old Samuel Road
where Monument crosses 63

408
00:17:59,514 --> 00:18:00,732
near the mattress factory.

409
00:18:00,776 --> 00:18:02,691
Oh, the old mattress joint.

410
00:18:02,734 --> 00:18:04,997
Yeah. Yeah, my ex-wife
used to work there.

411
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:06,912
Quality control.

412
00:18:07,652 --> 00:18:08,653
Really?

413
00:18:09,915 --> 00:18:12,135
I'm taking the piss
out of you, you bastard.

414
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:13,745
Christ.

415
00:18:15,486 --> 00:18:16,748
Hey, but listen, you know...

416
00:18:18,576 --> 00:18:20,143
I'm gonna scoot by there.

417
00:18:20,187 --> 00:18:22,014
You know, if I don't get there
today, probably tomorrow.

418
00:18:22,058 --> 00:18:23,581
Do me a favor.

419
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:26,671
Don't tell Bippy that I'm
coming. I wanna surprise him.

420
00:18:26,715 --> 00:18:28,891
I ain't seen the fuck
six, five years now.

421
00:18:29,805 --> 00:18:31,198
I wanna have a little fun
with him, all right?

422
00:18:33,243 --> 00:18:35,506
[Truby] You know, I used to work
at the munitions plant

423
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,335
until the asshole congressman
lost contracts.

424
00:18:38,988 --> 00:18:39,945
And, uh...

425
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:42,209
[scoffs] Can you believe they
don't need any more cannonballs?

426
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,733
No way, no more.

427
00:18:44,776 --> 00:18:47,866
So, I had an in over here,

428
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,738
so I used my in over here.

429
00:18:49,781 --> 00:18:51,566
My grandfather was a statuer.

430
00:18:51,827 --> 00:18:54,351
He, you know,
carved a lot of these himself.

431
00:18:54,395 --> 00:18:56,440
And this is one of my favorites,
there you go.

432
00:18:56,484 --> 00:18:58,050
-He did that?
-Fucking awesome.

433
00:18:58,094 --> 00:18:59,922
Goddamn work of art right there.

434
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:01,793
Did that one.

435
00:19:02,229 --> 00:19:03,317
Wow.

436
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,405
And that one.

437
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,755
My God!

438
00:19:07,234 --> 00:19:08,322
Mm-hmm.

439
00:19:08,365 --> 00:19:10,062
So, I don't get it.

440
00:19:10,106 --> 00:19:12,152
Why didn't you follow
in his footsteps?

441
00:19:12,848 --> 00:19:15,329
Uh, he had big feet.

442
00:19:15,372 --> 00:19:16,721
[laughs]

443
00:19:16,765 --> 00:19:18,158
All right, not funny either.
Watch your step.

444
00:19:19,115 --> 00:19:22,074
No, you know,
people gotta spend so much

445
00:19:22,118 --> 00:19:24,294
to see somebody's bones
in the ground these days.

446
00:19:24,338 --> 00:19:28,037
Nobody's got anything left
over for details and stuff.

447
00:19:28,864 --> 00:19:30,822
[Claire] I guess a lot people
really, you know...

448
00:19:31,432 --> 00:19:33,085
don't wanna think about it.

449
00:19:33,129 --> 00:19:34,391
[Truby] Yeah, I think,
you know--

450
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:36,088
I think a lot of people
don't wanna think

451
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:37,742
about a lot of shit
these days, you know.

452
00:19:39,701 --> 00:19:41,616
-[Claire] Truby--
-[Truby] Oh, I know, I know.

453
00:19:41,659 --> 00:19:43,095
We talked about this, I know.

454
00:19:43,531 --> 00:19:45,141
Sorry. Oh, wait, hey.

455
00:19:46,142 --> 00:19:49,276
Here it is. He had it in
his will, paid for it himself.

456
00:19:50,668 --> 00:19:52,017
So where you're from,

457
00:19:53,149 --> 00:19:54,890
did they have anything
like this where you're from?

458
00:19:56,283 --> 00:19:58,763
Yeah. Well, I mean,
we moved around a bit.

459
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:02,680
Your father is an army guy
or something?

460
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,813
No, he was a heart surgeon.

461
00:20:06,554 --> 00:20:07,642
Very professional.

462
00:20:09,296 --> 00:20:11,385
You know, it seems the only
heart he couldn't fix...

463
00:20:12,821 --> 00:20:13,909
was my mother's.

464
00:20:17,869 --> 00:20:18,870
I'm sorry.

465
00:20:20,698 --> 00:20:21,873
So was she.

466
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,398
She killed herself.

467
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,837
Hey...
you should, um...

468
00:20:30,882 --> 00:20:33,058
think about good stuff,
you know.

469
00:20:33,102 --> 00:20:34,886
Think about, you know...

470
00:20:39,064 --> 00:20:41,110
-Can we just go?
-[Truby] Yeah.

471
00:20:41,153 --> 00:20:42,154
-Wanna go?
-Yeah.

472
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:43,504
[Truby] Let's go.

473
00:20:47,203 --> 00:20:49,161
[Truby] Hey, it's a new kid.
[laughs]

474
00:20:53,296 --> 00:20:55,820
It's not your fault the world
doesn't devote itself

475
00:20:55,864 --> 00:20:57,257
to making him happy.

476
00:20:57,692 --> 00:20:59,302
He doesn't wanna hear
the truth anymore

477
00:20:59,346 --> 00:21:01,261
than you wanna tell it
to him.

478
00:21:01,304 --> 00:21:03,480
And if he's ever gonna have
this attack of conscience,

479
00:21:03,524 --> 00:21:04,960
don't you think
he would've had it by now?

480
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:07,876
It's just...

481
00:21:09,573 --> 00:21:11,183
we shared a lot
of things together.

482
00:21:12,663 --> 00:21:14,056
Including a mattress.

483
00:21:15,231 --> 00:21:17,364
I've heard this all before,

484
00:21:17,407 --> 00:21:19,496
one's standing up,
one's lying down.

485
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,150
Look, he wants you
sitting at home

486
00:21:21,193 --> 00:21:23,326
clipping coupons
and how-to articles,

487
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:26,155
than going outside
and making a life for yourself.

488
00:21:27,635 --> 00:21:28,853
He's scared of you,

489
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:31,334
and it's about time you woke up
and saw that.

490
00:21:31,987 --> 00:21:33,989
I did, and I feel great.

491
00:21:35,512 --> 00:21:36,513
You do?

492
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:38,298
Sometimes.

493
00:21:41,388 --> 00:21:44,652
How do you end something
with somebody after so long?

494
00:21:45,348 --> 00:21:46,306
Ten years.

495
00:21:47,437 --> 00:21:48,917
You decide to.

496
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,660
Decide to. [scoffs]

497
00:21:54,183 --> 00:21:55,837
Vikki, you gotta have
a bigger imagination

498
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,142
than he's got balls.

499
00:21:57,882 --> 00:21:58,970
Baby, you're miserable,

500
00:21:59,014 --> 00:22:00,320
you ought to do
something about it.

501
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:03,671
Got any twos?

502
00:22:13,768 --> 00:22:16,684
[Molly] Hi! No, no, I'm fine.

503
00:22:17,206 --> 00:22:18,599
I just--
I couldn't call you before,

504
00:22:18,642 --> 00:22:20,078
there's so much going on.

505
00:22:20,122 --> 00:22:21,341
Oh, all right.

506
00:22:23,821 --> 00:22:26,128
Okay. Why don't you
just call me later?

507
00:22:27,042 --> 00:22:28,348
I know. I love you, too.

508
00:22:33,483 --> 00:22:35,137
I don't know here, John.

509
00:22:35,572 --> 00:22:36,965
Going back...

510
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,795
five, six months here.

511
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:48,629
Oh. Well, that ain't
so much, Whitey.

512
00:22:49,717 --> 00:22:53,198
Well, I think it's fair enough
to say that it is...

513
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:55,810
enough.

514
00:22:57,159 --> 00:22:58,378
I mean, you're still getting
your checks, yeah?

515
00:22:59,422 --> 00:23:01,381
None of your goddamn business.

516
00:23:02,033 --> 00:23:03,557
My finance.

517
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,387
Listen, I'm just
a little backed up.

518
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,477
I'm just trying to get out
from under.

519
00:23:11,739 --> 00:23:14,176
I mean, how many times
did I buy you back tonight, huh?

520
00:23:16,483 --> 00:23:18,789
I just thought maybe you could
work with me a little bit

521
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:20,878
and we could get the numbers
going in the right direction.

522
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,185
I know...

523
00:23:23,228 --> 00:23:25,056
everybody's doing the best
they can.

524
00:23:26,057 --> 00:23:27,450
Rita, what are you doing?

525
00:23:28,495 --> 00:23:30,192
I mean, come back.

526
00:23:30,235 --> 00:23:31,672
Come-- Would you please
come back?

527
00:23:31,715 --> 00:23:34,414
I got one here
with your name on it, okay?

528
00:23:34,457 --> 00:23:35,632
Here, sit down.

529
00:23:35,676 --> 00:23:36,894
John, what are you drinking?

530
00:23:36,938 --> 00:23:38,461
[John] Oh,
if you could touch me off

531
00:23:38,505 --> 00:23:40,420
with a little of
that Old Grand-Dad.

532
00:23:41,856 --> 00:23:43,640
-[John chuckles]
-[Whitey] Okay.

533
00:23:47,818 --> 00:23:49,080
Forget about this.

534
00:23:49,864 --> 00:23:50,865
[taps glass]

535
00:23:59,482 --> 00:24:00,918
Christ Almighty.

536
00:24:03,747 --> 00:24:05,357
John and Rita
have been drinking here

537
00:24:05,401 --> 00:24:07,272
since before
you were in diapers.

538
00:24:07,316 --> 00:24:08,752
You got no business
putting them through

539
00:24:08,796 --> 00:24:10,014
something like that.

540
00:24:10,624 --> 00:24:11,929
[Whitey sighs]

541
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:14,845
The road gets rough out there,
Whitey,

542
00:24:14,889 --> 00:24:16,543
and life beats a man down.

543
00:24:18,806 --> 00:24:21,461
It's rare you'll ever win
back some measure

544
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,332
of what it all really means.

545
00:24:24,551 --> 00:24:26,074
They're happy for that.

546
00:24:27,554 --> 00:24:28,859
A gesture.

547
00:24:30,557 --> 00:24:33,081
A good bar brings forth a lot
in people, Whitey.

548
00:24:33,908 --> 00:24:35,083
Opens 'em up.

549
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,088
Hell, you can drink booze
anywhere, but a bar...

550
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:43,483
that belongs to them.

551
00:24:44,614 --> 00:24:46,355
There's the good thing it does.

552
00:24:52,448 --> 00:24:53,667
[Chickie] You can pay me, right?

553
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,147
-All good.
-You guys take care.

554
00:24:57,061 --> 00:24:58,193
See you next week.

555
00:25:07,724 --> 00:25:08,725
Four-eighty.

556
00:25:10,118 --> 00:25:11,511
Those inspection stickers
I gave you last spring,

557
00:25:11,554 --> 00:25:13,861
-they move out fast enough?
-Hundred miles an hour.

558
00:25:13,904 --> 00:25:16,124
All right. Right, right.

559
00:25:20,345 --> 00:25:21,390
Have a cookie?

560
00:25:23,131 --> 00:25:25,002
Chickie, Chickie, Chickie.

561
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:29,354
[Chickie] Got two grand there.

562
00:25:30,486 --> 00:25:32,532
Bought it for ten cents
and a dollar face value.

563
00:25:34,316 --> 00:25:36,187
-This is good shit.
-[Chickie] It's the ink.

564
00:25:36,231 --> 00:25:38,146
It's cured right in the paper.

565
00:25:38,189 --> 00:25:39,539
There's all
the security threads,

566
00:25:39,582 --> 00:25:40,714
all the fibers.

567
00:25:40,757 --> 00:25:42,237
It's the shits, man.

568
00:25:42,498 --> 00:25:45,196
Clean as new money,
all the way from Montreal.

569
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:47,851
You didn't cook
this up yourself.

570
00:25:47,895 --> 00:25:49,418
No, no, no, no.

571
00:25:49,461 --> 00:25:51,115
Friend of mine named Paris.

572
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:53,465
Him and his party get them over
at a card game in Pittsburgh.

573
00:25:54,205 --> 00:25:55,772
But that's it
for the month, though.

574
00:25:55,816 --> 00:25:57,469
You don't wanna burn out
the area.

575
00:25:57,861 --> 00:25:59,123
These guys are smart.

576
00:26:00,603 --> 00:26:02,779
You can get 30, 40 points
in those notes and sleep.

577
00:26:03,911 --> 00:26:05,608
It's like selling ice cream
at the beach.

578
00:26:07,044 --> 00:26:09,133
Finally made yourself
a deuce in life, eh, Chick?

579
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:14,182
[music playing]

580
00:26:24,671 --> 00:26:25,933
[Billy] Oof.

581
00:26:26,368 --> 00:26:28,675
[tuts] Very unforgiving.

582
00:26:30,198 --> 00:26:32,635
Very, very, very unforgiving.

583
00:26:34,855 --> 00:26:36,465
I'm referring to the table,
of course.

584
00:26:37,248 --> 00:26:38,598
Most of them
aren't made here anymore.

585
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,688
All this crap's from Asia now,

586
00:26:41,731 --> 00:26:44,212
India, subcontinent countries.

587
00:26:46,257 --> 00:26:47,607
It's a fucking shame that is.

588
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:48,520
These balls?

589
00:26:49,478 --> 00:26:50,697
Used to be made out of ivory,

590
00:26:51,698 --> 00:26:53,874
imported then manufactured
stateside.

591
00:26:55,963 --> 00:26:57,181
Now it's all acrylic.

592
00:26:57,791 --> 00:26:59,531
Crap, garbage.

593
00:27:01,577 --> 00:27:02,796
Is that a house stick?

594
00:27:05,929 --> 00:27:07,931
You know, I was watching you
for a few minutes.

595
00:27:07,975 --> 00:27:09,629
You got yourself
a pretty sweet stroke there.

596
00:27:10,499 --> 00:27:11,500
It's fluid.

597
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,720
Keep your elbow tucked in,
where'd you pick that up?

598
00:27:14,938 --> 00:27:16,287
I've been playing all my life,
you know.

599
00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:18,899
Who taught you how to bridge?

600
00:27:18,942 --> 00:27:21,075
Nobody. Myself, I guess.

601
00:27:21,684 --> 00:27:23,207
[Billy] You wanna say it again
only louder

602
00:27:23,251 --> 00:27:24,556
so the whole class can hear?

603
00:27:25,296 --> 00:27:26,994
It's a fundamental, kid.

604
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:29,474
You're doing it all wrong.

605
00:27:34,305 --> 00:27:36,481
There's a day I'd run
a hundred balls for breakfast.

606
00:27:36,786 --> 00:27:38,222
That was a bad day.

607
00:27:38,266 --> 00:27:41,051
Big dollar guy.
Big dollar player.

608
00:27:41,312 --> 00:27:43,097
One pocket, bank pool,

609
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,707
three-time nine-ball
tournament champ

610
00:27:44,751 --> 00:27:46,317
out of Vegas late '70s.

611
00:27:47,318 --> 00:27:49,364
I was so good I'd
spy God in the eight ball.

612
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,279
Then things happened.

613
00:27:52,323 --> 00:27:54,108
Things started to crumble,
you know.

614
00:27:54,151 --> 00:27:56,763
Got so fucking weird
I can hear the fibers bending

615
00:27:56,806 --> 00:27:58,329
as the balls
ran over the felt.

616
00:27:59,766 --> 00:28:00,462
[scoffs]

617
00:28:01,245 --> 00:28:02,551
Methamphetamine.

618
00:28:03,117 --> 00:28:04,553
All day, all night.

619
00:28:04,596 --> 00:28:06,686
Fucking cuckoo boo,
thought I was Christ.

620
00:28:08,818 --> 00:28:10,298
Then things started closing in,

621
00:28:11,473 --> 00:28:12,474
I had to quit.

622
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:16,347
Placed my faith
in higher things.

623
00:28:19,655 --> 00:28:21,222
I think of the money
those motherfuckers

624
00:28:21,265 --> 00:28:22,571
made off my arm.

625
00:28:23,615 --> 00:28:24,355
Wow...

626
00:28:24,921 --> 00:28:26,618
really chaps my ass.

627
00:28:30,405 --> 00:28:31,493
[sighs]

628
00:28:32,886 --> 00:28:34,365
Here I am, pissing
and moaning getting all rummy

629
00:28:34,409 --> 00:28:36,019
on you like a fucking little
Girl Scout.

630
00:28:36,063 --> 00:28:37,238
I didn't catch your name.

631
00:28:37,281 --> 00:28:38,413
Oh. Frankie.

632
00:28:39,675 --> 00:28:42,547
They, uh-- They call me
Frankie Eyelashes.

633
00:28:43,418 --> 00:28:45,246
-You're good-looking.
-[Frankie] Yeah.

634
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:46,334
You from around here?

635
00:28:46,813 --> 00:28:48,205
Yeah.

636
00:28:48,249 --> 00:28:49,641
[Billy] Well, you mix it up any?

637
00:28:49,685 --> 00:28:50,947
You know, shoot for money?

638
00:28:50,991 --> 00:28:53,515
No, no, no.
I'm just killing time.

639
00:28:53,558 --> 00:28:55,604
Good. I don't think
you're looking snazzy

640
00:28:55,647 --> 00:28:57,171
with your ass hanging out
and all.

641
00:29:00,261 --> 00:29:01,741
Can I buy you a drink
in the lounge?

642
00:29:02,437 --> 00:29:03,525
[coughs]

643
00:29:03,568 --> 00:29:05,005
[Bobby] You gonna live,
buddy?

644
00:29:05,396 --> 00:29:06,963
I had this cold
since the Preakness,

645
00:29:07,007 --> 00:29:08,573
I can't seem to shake it.

646
00:29:08,617 --> 00:29:10,750
[Bobby] Well, you're sitting
next to a goddamn meat locker.

647
00:29:10,793 --> 00:29:11,838
Draught alone is enough

648
00:29:11,881 --> 00:29:13,361
to knock the fucking hat
off your head.

649
00:29:14,057 --> 00:29:15,450
Thermostat's broke.

650
00:29:16,581 --> 00:29:19,106
But you know me, Bobby.
I bring my own heat.

651
00:29:19,802 --> 00:29:21,978
Nick, I need you to square
a favor with me.

652
00:29:22,022 --> 00:29:23,153
What's the dance?

653
00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:25,503
I need you to sing
at the wedding reception

654
00:29:25,547 --> 00:29:27,070
for Molly Riley
and Jack the Plumber

655
00:29:27,114 --> 00:29:28,550
on the 22nd of the month.

656
00:29:28,593 --> 00:29:30,247
Well, it's out of the question.

657
00:29:30,291 --> 00:29:33,207
That's next weekend.
I got the boat show.

658
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,165
A thousand people
come to see me.

659
00:29:35,209 --> 00:29:36,863
A thousand people
come to see boats, Nick.

660
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,170
They get you, but they come
to see the boats.

661
00:29:41,998 --> 00:29:43,565
Any other weekend's fine.

662
00:29:44,827 --> 00:29:45,785
I'm booked.

663
00:29:47,134 --> 00:29:49,136
For years
I'm in solid over there.

664
00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:50,659
I gave them my word.

665
00:29:50,702 --> 00:29:52,835
Who are you, Pike Bishop
and The Wild Bunch?

666
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,882
Well, who the hell am I gonna
get to cover the date?

667
00:29:56,447 --> 00:29:57,840
[Bobby] I already did it.

668
00:29:57,884 --> 00:30:00,103
Called Abe Moby
at the civic center

669
00:30:00,712 --> 00:30:03,193
and he's gonna book
our stumble-bum friend, uh,

670
00:30:03,237 --> 00:30:05,195
-Cozy Miller.
-Cozy Miller?

671
00:30:05,892 --> 00:30:07,502
The guy can't hold my laundry.

672
00:30:08,024 --> 00:30:10,374
He's church dances,
beef and beer shit.

673
00:30:11,898 --> 00:30:14,944
Besides, Cozy,
he won't do it. Nah...

674
00:30:15,466 --> 00:30:19,122
The money's right,
but it's my crowd.

675
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:21,255
They'll throw his ass
in the trout pool.

676
00:30:23,953 --> 00:30:26,564
[Frankie] I'm telling you
every worm, rat, and snake

677
00:30:26,608 --> 00:30:28,697
in that joint made out
except us.

678
00:30:29,611 --> 00:30:31,700
Why pay a man a living wage?

679
00:30:31,743 --> 00:30:33,658
You can hire a Chinese kid
get out of prison camp

680
00:30:33,702 --> 00:30:35,617
to work his ass off
for nine cents a week.

681
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,010
How do these people
sleep at night?

682
00:30:37,053 --> 00:30:38,881
[Billy] I don't know.
Don't get it.

683
00:30:38,925 --> 00:30:40,056
My old man...

684
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:43,712
[grunts]

685
00:30:43,755 --> 00:30:45,627
23 years, call and time.

686
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:48,021
Do you know he's got the show
for his time on this planet?

687
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,457
What's that?

688
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,720
Limp dick, a lollipop
and two sticks of bubblegum.

689
00:30:51,763 --> 00:30:53,591
[scoffs]
Picture of good living, huh?

690
00:30:53,635 --> 00:30:55,115
[scoffs] Cocksuckers.

691
00:30:55,158 --> 00:30:57,508
Now, this is the best thing
to happen to you anyway.

692
00:30:57,552 --> 00:30:59,336
I mean, you could sit
around here all day,

693
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,903
call 'em all the "motherfuckers"
in the world,

694
00:31:00,947 --> 00:31:02,687
and they're still gonna do
the right thing for who?

695
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:04,211
For them.

696
00:31:04,646 --> 00:31:05,560
What do you mean?

697
00:31:07,823 --> 00:31:10,260
You're playing beneath
your speed, Frankie.

698
00:31:10,304 --> 00:31:12,262
Their game is designed
to let you down,

699
00:31:12,306 --> 00:31:13,960
gives them no greater pleasure.

700
00:31:14,003 --> 00:31:16,745
And for what anyway, huh?
A nowhere's job?

701
00:31:17,224 --> 00:31:18,747
Life without prospects?

702
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,445
Living out your days
like a fucking zombie?

703
00:31:21,489 --> 00:31:23,795
For what,
a little spending cash? Huh?

704
00:31:25,493 --> 00:31:26,494
Let it go.

705
00:31:27,016 --> 00:31:29,149
-Let it fucking go.
-All right.

706
00:31:29,671 --> 00:31:31,586
Count your blessings,
Jesus Christ.

707
00:31:34,328 --> 00:31:35,459
Mm.

708
00:31:35,503 --> 00:31:37,505
What do you want
out of life, anyway?

709
00:31:37,548 --> 00:31:39,899
What would it take for you
to feel...

710
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:40,812
successful?

711
00:31:42,075 --> 00:31:43,511
Feel like a...

712
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,078
Like a man?

713
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:49,734
I don't know,
but a lot.

714
00:31:50,518 --> 00:31:51,780
You don't know?

715
00:31:52,563 --> 00:31:54,174
Well, that's as dumb
as dog shit.

716
00:31:54,217 --> 00:31:55,305
"I don't know."

717
00:31:56,611 --> 00:31:57,699
A mentality like that
will get you a good job

718
00:31:57,742 --> 00:31:59,005
driving a peanut truck.

719
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,747
Frankie, you sound like
everybody else.

720
00:32:03,879 --> 00:32:06,229
Like you're stuck between
a shit and a sweat.

721
00:32:06,751 --> 00:32:09,929
Timid, dreaming.
It's all about disappointment,

722
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,757
dashed hopes, hard luck.

723
00:32:12,801 --> 00:32:16,500
Never turning over the coin,
never seeing an opportunity.

724
00:32:16,544 --> 00:32:18,546
Never peeking
at the seeds of triumph.

725
00:32:20,591 --> 00:32:21,810
Frankie, they're there.

726
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,987
For you, for me, for everybody.

727
00:32:26,206 --> 00:32:27,163
They are there.

728
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,124
[Truby] Come back, Jack!

729
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:33,996
[Jack] You know, that river's
very long but it's skinny.

730
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,956
[laughter]

731
00:32:38,435 --> 00:32:40,655
[Bobby] We just don't want you
to make the same mistake

732
00:32:40,698 --> 00:32:43,353
everybody else has made
when they take the plunge.

733
00:32:44,876 --> 00:32:46,139
Which is what?

734
00:32:46,182 --> 00:32:48,968
Which is disappearing
up your own ass, Jack.

735
00:32:49,881 --> 00:32:51,231
All in the name of love.

736
00:32:51,883 --> 00:32:54,886
You know what a
decision like this means?

737
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:57,280
Do you know what a handicap
this wedding vow is?

738
00:32:57,324 --> 00:32:59,587
Let's say you're bowling your
ass off at McManus's.

739
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,415
You told Molly you'd be home
by 9:45.

740
00:33:02,024 --> 00:33:03,417
-Fuck it. Fuck it.
-[Truby] Fuck that.

741
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,462
We would say fuck that.

742
00:33:05,723 --> 00:33:07,377
Five hours later, you roll in,
half a nut on,

743
00:33:07,421 --> 00:33:08,813
you're smiling from ear to ear.

744
00:33:08,857 --> 00:33:10,685
Okay, Jack. Her head then...

745
00:33:11,816 --> 00:33:14,036
okay, that's spinning
so fucking fast

746
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,778
she's not gonna know whether
to shit or blow her nose.

747
00:33:16,821 --> 00:33:19,911
You know, and I like Molly,
don't get me wrong, man.

748
00:33:19,955 --> 00:33:21,217
[Bobby] Hey, Jack.

749
00:33:21,261 --> 00:33:23,306
You see, some women
need to be needed, Jack,

750
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,829
and that just can't be,
you know.

751
00:33:24,873 --> 00:33:26,570
You'd be spending
your whole life together,

752
00:33:26,614 --> 00:33:28,659
you know, trying to avoid her
driving you nuts.

753
00:33:28,964 --> 00:33:31,053
Yeah, she'll resort to the whole
circus full of tricks.

754
00:33:31,836 --> 00:33:33,838
She'll say this,
she'll try that,

755
00:33:33,882 --> 00:33:35,666
-blah, blah, blah. Fuck that.
-[Truby] Blah, blah,

756
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,842
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

757
00:33:37,886 --> 00:33:40,454
Jack, just smile...

758
00:33:41,281 --> 00:33:42,412
scratch your ass...

759
00:33:43,283 --> 00:33:44,588
and say, "Honey...

760
00:33:45,241 --> 00:33:47,113
do you remember to put gas
in the fucking car?"

761
00:33:47,156 --> 00:33:49,071
-[laughs]
-"Did you?"

762
00:33:49,115 --> 00:33:51,247
The more shit she pulls,
the more shit you let her.

763
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:52,640
You just let her.

764
00:33:52,683 --> 00:33:56,165
But it ain't gonna be so bad.
Marriage and all.

765
00:33:56,905 --> 00:33:58,820
Neither's a train wreck
as long as you ain't in it.

766
00:33:58,863 --> 00:34:00,735
[laughter]

767
00:34:04,521 --> 00:34:05,696
[man] Jack!

768
00:34:06,132 --> 00:34:07,089
Jack!

769
00:34:08,917 --> 00:34:10,440
[Truby] Hey. Hey.

770
00:34:10,484 --> 00:34:11,963
[man] Calm down, son.

771
00:34:12,007 --> 00:34:14,096
-Jack is here.
-Yeah, he's back.

772
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,229
Jack is gracing us
with his presence.

773
00:34:16,272 --> 00:34:17,665
-[man] Hey, Jack.
-Spin, Jack.

774
00:34:17,708 --> 00:34:19,319
-[man] That's me boy.
-[Bobby] Spin.

775
00:34:21,886 --> 00:34:22,887
[Truby] Spin.

776
00:34:23,888 --> 00:34:24,933
See, Jack?

777
00:34:25,499 --> 00:34:26,848
Who said all the good ones
are taken?

778
00:34:28,154 --> 00:34:29,546
[crowd] Whoa!

779
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:32,332
Oh. Gee, Jack.
You need a break, Jack.

780
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:34,334
Absolutely not, Jack.

781
00:34:34,377 --> 00:34:37,337
-Definitely not, Jack,
-[Truby] One, two, three.

782
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:40,122
I drink to your good health.

783
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:40,949
[man] Oh.

784
00:34:45,301 --> 00:34:47,260
Bobby, I told you
to take him out,

785
00:34:47,303 --> 00:34:49,131
I didn't tell you to kill him.

786
00:34:49,175 --> 00:34:50,959
Frankie. Frankie, get a mirror.

787
00:34:51,002 --> 00:34:52,787
-Put it under his nose.
-[Frankie] All right.

788
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,310
-And then do the other side.
-[Whitey] Jack.

789
00:34:55,529 --> 00:34:56,965
[Bobby]
Hey, Whitey, take the cork

790
00:34:57,008 --> 00:34:58,923
out of your ass, all right?
He's having a blast.

791
00:34:58,967 --> 00:35:00,838
You're acting like
I killed a pet.

792
00:35:00,882 --> 00:35:02,536
-Jack.
-[Bobby] It's a party.

793
00:35:03,754 --> 00:35:05,365
So, let's party, goddamn it.

794
00:35:05,408 --> 00:35:06,496
[man] Watch the bar there.

795
00:35:07,932 --> 00:35:09,934
-Oh, great.
-[Truby] Jack.

796
00:35:09,978 --> 00:35:11,936
-You're giving me a headache.
-[Truby] Jack!

797
00:35:15,984 --> 00:35:16,724
Jack!

798
00:35:18,029 --> 00:35:19,030
Jack!

799
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,817
[footsteps approaching]

800
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:27,517
Bobby, let me tell you
something.

801
00:35:27,996 --> 00:35:30,259
There's a proper way
to conduct business

802
00:35:30,303 --> 00:35:31,913
and this ain't it.

803
00:35:31,956 --> 00:35:33,784
I'm just charging my batteries,
buddy.

804
00:35:37,266 --> 00:35:38,833
I don't trust you anymore.

805
00:35:39,399 --> 00:35:41,009
What's that supposed
to mean, Whitey?

806
00:35:41,052 --> 00:35:42,924
I mean, what the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

807
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:45,231
You've always been a tolerant,
decent guy, right?

808
00:35:45,274 --> 00:35:46,971
And where the fuck's
it gotten you?

809
00:35:47,624 --> 00:35:49,017
And don't worry about me, buddy.

810
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,714
I'm the only guy in the world
who knows

811
00:35:50,758 --> 00:35:51,976
what the fuck he's doing.

812
00:35:52,368 --> 00:35:53,500
[Whitey] You're leading
with your chin

813
00:35:53,543 --> 00:35:55,197
on this Joe situation.

814
00:35:55,763 --> 00:35:57,330
The guy is like
a fucking cancer.

815
00:35:57,373 --> 00:35:58,374
Did you know that?

816
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,985
Remember what happened
to my daddy?

817
00:36:01,029 --> 00:36:02,204
I remember.

818
00:36:02,248 --> 00:36:03,945
But he's giving me the elbow.
Big deal.

819
00:36:03,988 --> 00:36:05,990
He's a fucking heavy-hitter.
He's a fucking jerk-off.

820
00:36:06,382 --> 00:36:08,079
Started with the jukebox,
a candy machine

821
00:36:08,123 --> 00:36:09,255
and a quarter pool table.

822
00:36:09,298 --> 00:36:10,778
You don't think I know
who the fuck

823
00:36:10,821 --> 00:36:11,822
I'm playing chicken with?

824
00:36:12,997 --> 00:36:14,303
He ain't crowding you, is he?

825
00:36:14,347 --> 00:36:15,565
Because if he is,
I'll lump the motherfucker.

826
00:36:15,609 --> 00:36:17,132
I wish you would.

827
00:36:17,611 --> 00:36:19,656
Fucking guy needs a beating,
I'm telling you.

828
00:36:19,917 --> 00:36:21,615
Look, I'm just
raising his hand a little.

829
00:36:21,658 --> 00:36:23,051
Nothing to worry about.

830
00:36:24,792 --> 00:36:25,793
Says you.

831
00:36:26,228 --> 00:36:26,968
[machine rattles]

832
00:36:27,273 --> 00:36:28,361
If I, uh...

833
00:36:29,971 --> 00:36:31,451
If I roll this thing on,

834
00:36:31,494 --> 00:36:33,279
can I-- Can I then
go fuck myself?

835
00:36:33,322 --> 00:36:35,585
[laughs]

836
00:36:35,629 --> 00:36:37,108
Whatever makes you happy.

837
00:36:37,457 --> 00:36:38,849
[laughter]

838
00:36:40,634 --> 00:36:41,896
Just a thought.

839
00:36:43,289 --> 00:36:45,247
-Whitey.
-Where have you been all night?

840
00:36:45,291 --> 00:36:47,510
We've been waiting for you
for a long time, for God's sake?

841
00:36:47,554 --> 00:36:48,598
Well, Jack was busy.

842
00:36:49,338 --> 00:36:50,557
Yeah, I can see that.

843
00:36:50,992 --> 00:36:52,602
So I'm set up with Cozy, right?

844
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,083
I got to be honest
with you, Whitey.

845
00:36:55,126 --> 00:36:56,215
I'm allergic to the whole idea

846
00:36:56,258 --> 00:36:57,607
of this bastard
singing anywhere,

847
00:36:57,651 --> 00:36:58,782
let alone a wedding I'm at.

848
00:36:59,522 --> 00:37:00,828
This guy's got crowds
around him?

849
00:37:00,871 --> 00:37:01,872
Damn. [scoffs]

850
00:37:02,482 --> 00:37:03,700
If Molly were my sister,

851
00:37:04,266 --> 00:37:06,181
and I was shopping
for a night of music,

852
00:37:06,747 --> 00:37:08,618
Cozy would be my first mistake.

853
00:37:08,662 --> 00:37:10,272
You can't dance to Cozy Miller.

854
00:37:10,316 --> 00:37:12,143
We shouldn't even be having
this conversation.

855
00:37:12,187 --> 00:37:13,406
I mean, you know how I feel.

856
00:37:13,449 --> 00:37:14,711
[man grunts]

857
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:17,888
Go play with the girl.

858
00:37:17,932 --> 00:37:18,933
Yes.

859
00:37:23,459 --> 00:37:25,896
[Truby]
Altar boy, altar boy.

860
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,550
That brings back time,
doesn't it?

861
00:37:27,594 --> 00:37:29,291
[Teddy] Handpicked by God.

862
00:37:29,335 --> 00:37:30,249
[chuckles]

863
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,080
It sounds like
you dropped out, man.

864
00:37:36,124 --> 00:37:39,040
No. It's just some things
are going on I don't--

865
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:43,914
Need some distance,
some distance.

866
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:47,614
I didn't do right by people.

867
00:37:49,659 --> 00:37:50,834
You know?

868
00:37:50,878 --> 00:37:55,099
I didn't do right
by Molly at all.

869
00:37:55,404 --> 00:37:56,318
I ain't proud of it.

870
00:37:56,927 --> 00:37:58,277
Just the way it went down.

871
00:38:00,148 --> 00:38:01,497
I just figured I'd call,
you know,

872
00:38:01,541 --> 00:38:02,542
if I have some good news.

873
00:38:04,065 --> 00:38:05,936
Never did.
[laughs]

874
00:38:08,417 --> 00:38:10,114
Sorry if I let you guys
down, you know.

875
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,682
So, everybody all right?

876
00:38:14,554 --> 00:38:17,121
Well, other than that,
Mr. Lincoln,

877
00:38:17,165 --> 00:38:18,384
how'd you like to play?

878
00:38:19,167 --> 00:38:19,907
[laughs]

879
00:38:21,561 --> 00:38:23,214
What do you mean all right, huh?

880
00:38:23,258 --> 00:38:26,696
You know, some things are good,

881
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,524
some things are bad. You know...

882
00:38:29,264 --> 00:38:31,919
Some things are different,
you know.

883
00:38:33,529 --> 00:38:36,010
[scoffs] Some things
are real different.

884
00:38:40,754 --> 00:38:41,755
Molly?

885
00:38:47,282 --> 00:38:50,677
You mean getting-married-
next-weekend Molly?

886
00:38:52,983 --> 00:38:54,028
[chuckles] Really?

887
00:38:55,421 --> 00:38:56,204
She...

888
00:38:58,293 --> 00:39:00,469
I don't wanna say there's
a price on your head,

889
00:39:01,383 --> 00:39:04,604
because nobody knows your back,
but there's a lot of people

890
00:39:04,647 --> 00:39:07,389
who might
feel a whole lot better

891
00:39:07,433 --> 00:39:09,565
if you made yourself scarce
for the time being?

892
00:39:10,131 --> 00:39:11,001
Who is she marrying?

893
00:39:12,438 --> 00:39:13,526
Jack Ryan.

894
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:15,615
[scoffs]

895
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,225
Wow.

896
00:39:19,445 --> 00:39:20,446
Wow.

897
00:39:23,144 --> 00:39:24,145
Wow.

898
00:39:27,278 --> 00:39:28,018
Jack Ryan...

899
00:39:29,977 --> 00:39:31,544
-Well, he's a nice guy.
-Yeah.

900
00:39:31,587 --> 00:39:33,023
-He a plumber?
-Yeah.

901
00:39:33,067 --> 00:39:34,111
-He's a plumber, right?
-Right.

902
00:39:34,155 --> 00:39:35,417
-He's a plumber.
-Yeah.

903
00:39:36,723 --> 00:39:38,246
We're standing in with him.

904
00:39:38,681 --> 00:39:40,553
Me and Bobby,
Frankie and Whitey.

905
00:39:40,596 --> 00:39:41,858
You know, he's...

906
00:39:44,818 --> 00:39:46,472
He loves her, Teddy,
you know?

907
00:39:47,516 --> 00:39:49,300
Yeah, I know, cool it.

908
00:39:52,826 --> 00:39:55,219
He's a stand-up guy.
He's banging.

909
00:39:57,221 --> 00:39:58,048
And Whitey?

910
00:40:03,924 --> 00:40:05,491
He's coming down hard, Teddy.

911
00:40:05,882 --> 00:40:07,014
Pulling out like that and all...

912
00:40:08,276 --> 00:40:09,799
You know how he is.

913
00:40:10,365 --> 00:40:12,933
-He's still behind the stick?
-Yeah. Yeah.

914
00:40:12,976 --> 00:40:15,065
Florentine's still
creeping along.

915
00:40:15,109 --> 00:40:16,066
Still breathing.

916
00:40:18,808 --> 00:40:20,027
-You seeing anyone?
-[gasps]

917
00:40:20,636 --> 00:40:22,116
You seeing anyone?

918
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:23,857
-Teddy, this--
-Are you seeing anyone?

919
00:40:24,205 --> 00:40:25,467
This-- This--

920
00:40:25,772 --> 00:40:28,165
This girl. You have to see--
Wait. Just wait.

921
00:40:28,209 --> 00:40:29,123
She is...

922
00:40:31,342 --> 00:40:33,257
-She is a doll.
-Really?

923
00:40:34,084 --> 00:40:36,347
This girl could make you
wanna run home

924
00:40:36,391 --> 00:40:37,871
-and shoot your whole family.
-Oh, really?

925
00:40:37,914 --> 00:40:39,220
-This girl... bang!
-That's good.

926
00:40:39,263 --> 00:40:42,963
She's-- Teddy,
she's pretty, you know.

927
00:40:43,006 --> 00:40:44,617
She's-- Hold this one sec.

928
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,445
She's pretty,
you know what I mean?

929
00:40:47,315 --> 00:40:49,665
She-- Any girl in any magazine,
forget it.

930
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:52,059
It doesn't come close.

931
00:40:52,494 --> 00:40:54,496
If you've seen her,
you'll hear music in your head.

932
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:57,064
It's what I hear, church music.
More church music.

933
00:40:59,066 --> 00:41:01,285
So, how long this been going on?

934
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:06,987
Oh, you know, it's...
Quite some time. Yeah.

935
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,554
-That's good.
-Yeah.

936
00:41:08,597 --> 00:41:09,468
You wanna stay?

937
00:41:11,557 --> 00:41:13,515
Um, you know,
what are you doing right now?

938
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:14,690
You wanna come with me?

939
00:41:14,734 --> 00:41:16,257
I'm taking--
I'm supposed to meet her.

940
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,388
I'm not doing nothing.

941
00:41:17,432 --> 00:41:18,781
Come on,
she works at Needleman's

942
00:41:18,825 --> 00:41:19,869
-Right? Yeah.
-Okay.

943
00:41:19,913 --> 00:41:21,349
Where the fuck you've been gone?

944
00:41:21,392 --> 00:41:23,960
Needleman's which is now Dina's,
right?

945
00:41:24,744 --> 00:41:26,920
The old Jew died
of fucking throat cancer.

946
00:41:26,963 --> 00:41:28,138
[Teddy] Yeah.

947
00:41:28,617 --> 00:41:30,967
[Truby] Goddamn Greeks
came in, took over.

948
00:41:31,011 --> 00:41:33,317
They're shitting in his grave,
what these people did.

949
00:41:33,361 --> 00:41:34,710
I know this because I work
in the cemetery.

950
00:41:40,368 --> 00:41:41,891
Well obviously doing things
your own way

951
00:41:41,935 --> 00:41:44,154
ain't exactly worked out
for me, has it?

952
00:41:49,943 --> 00:41:51,553
You know who you are, Pretty?

953
00:41:52,032 --> 00:41:53,555
You're a guy that owes me money.

954
00:41:55,426 --> 00:41:57,472
That's crook in the house,
Bobby.

955
00:41:57,951 --> 00:42:00,127
You're buying dollars,
it's washing money.

956
00:42:00,736 --> 00:42:02,259
And more importantly,
it takes my foot

957
00:42:02,303 --> 00:42:03,565
completely out of your ass.

958
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,747
Pick the groundman'’s, right?

959
00:42:12,443 --> 00:42:13,662
Thursday night.

960
00:42:13,967 --> 00:42:15,272
Joe's got a bunch
of tables there,

961
00:42:15,316 --> 00:42:16,578
he runs some heavy dice action.

962
00:42:16,622 --> 00:42:18,537
When you go in,
don't go in double-fisted,

963
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,235
just relax, have a few drinks,
enjoy yourself.

964
00:42:21,278 --> 00:42:24,281
And then, slowly,
slowly load the wagons.

965
00:42:28,068 --> 00:42:30,461
You're gonna get even on this.
It's a good deal for you.

966
00:42:32,725 --> 00:42:35,205
Trust me, all right?

967
00:42:37,686 --> 00:42:39,993
All right.
I know I can count on you.

968
00:42:48,697 --> 00:42:50,569
[Pretty] You really hit as hard
as everyone said you did?

969
00:42:52,005 --> 00:42:53,136
No.

970
00:42:53,615 --> 00:42:54,573
Harder.

971
00:42:55,835 --> 00:42:56,836
What happened that you're out
of the game?

972
00:42:58,620 --> 00:42:59,578
It's a long story.

973
00:43:00,622 --> 00:43:02,145
Your eye, right? Your retina?

974
00:43:02,929 --> 00:43:04,147
[Bobby] Yeah, it was my eye.

975
00:43:04,931 --> 00:43:06,062
Be careful, Pretty.

976
00:43:06,933 --> 00:43:08,499
You can see everything
in a man's eyes.

977
00:43:14,114 --> 00:43:16,290
[Billy] When you stop looking
for something, Frankie,

978
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:18,292
you know where you
normally find it?

979
00:43:22,035 --> 00:43:23,210
Right in front of you?

980
00:43:25,168 --> 00:43:26,430
[Billy chuckles]

981
00:43:28,258 --> 00:43:29,477
[Billy]
Hundred years of tradition.

982
00:43:30,217 --> 00:43:31,522
I'm hampered by progress.

983
00:43:33,176 --> 00:43:34,613
Louisiana tail meat.

984
00:43:35,265 --> 00:43:37,398
Small scale cray fish market.

985
00:43:37,441 --> 00:43:38,791
[Frankie] I'm not familiar.

986
00:43:38,834 --> 00:43:40,357
-Cajun popcorn?
-Uh-uh.

987
00:43:40,401 --> 00:43:41,402
Crawdads?

988
00:43:42,795 --> 00:43:45,014
An eighth and a quarter a pound,
without that tariff,

989
00:43:45,058 --> 00:43:47,234
those Jap trawlers
can't compete.

990
00:43:47,669 --> 00:43:51,064
We're priced to move.
This ship? Hotter than summer.

991
00:43:51,107 --> 00:43:52,500
In less than two years,

992
00:43:52,718 --> 00:43:54,502
every kid in America
is gonna be eating it

993
00:43:54,545 --> 00:43:55,938
like French fries.

994
00:43:55,982 --> 00:43:58,637
Wall Street Journal
calls it paycheck of the future.

995
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,552
All this and without
getting your shirt dirty.

996
00:44:02,075 --> 00:44:04,425
Hey, Phil!

997
00:44:07,036 --> 00:44:08,647
Say hi to Carol for me.

998
00:44:11,084 --> 00:44:12,694
I'm godfather to both
of his boys.

999
00:44:13,521 --> 00:44:15,958
You know, potatohead looks
over this land,

1000
00:44:16,002 --> 00:44:17,743
-he sees a fucking sinkhole.
-Yeah?

1001
00:44:17,786 --> 00:44:20,049
That's why he stays
a clown ass all his life.

1002
00:44:20,093 --> 00:44:23,139
What we're talking about here,
it's pure.

1003
00:44:23,879 --> 00:44:25,925
It's flawless.
Immutable.

1004
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:29,102
And way beyond guys
like you and me.

1005
00:44:29,145 --> 00:44:31,757
I'm talking about
three parts, forty acres,

1006
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,324
sixty thousand
pounds of fish per yield.

1007
00:44:35,456 --> 00:44:38,677
Set up right,
your fish will Saint Pete.

1008
00:44:39,373 --> 00:44:41,375
Profits roll in
like water down a hill.

1009
00:44:42,768 --> 00:44:44,900
You set the net out
a little farther,

1010
00:44:44,944 --> 00:44:46,946
probably talking about
a pond side restaurant,

1011
00:44:46,989 --> 00:44:49,905
gift shop,
all sorts of horseshit.

1012
00:44:51,037 --> 00:44:52,560
Monkey trick here, Frankie.

1013
00:44:53,909 --> 00:44:56,129
So, keep Castro's army here
on the move,

1014
00:44:56,172 --> 00:44:57,696
working all the time.

1015
00:44:58,131 --> 00:45:01,003
That way, late January,
the pond is stocked

1016
00:45:01,047 --> 00:45:02,526
for peak season in June.

1017
00:45:03,179 --> 00:45:04,703
Then we double back
in December

1018
00:45:05,094 --> 00:45:06,400
and we're in the black.

1019
00:45:07,009 --> 00:45:08,445
Problem is
I'm running through money

1020
00:45:08,489 --> 00:45:09,751
like Grant through Richmond.

1021
00:45:11,666 --> 00:45:13,102
[sighs]

1022
00:45:13,755 --> 00:45:15,975
[Frankie] I know some people,
I could ask around.

1023
00:45:16,976 --> 00:45:19,369
[sighs] Frankie, come on,
you're on the balls of your ass.

1024
00:45:19,413 --> 00:45:21,676
I know that. It ain't fair.

1025
00:45:22,416 --> 00:45:24,331
You going out there,
trying to goose some bread up

1026
00:45:24,374 --> 00:45:25,767
for me, you know,
it's dangerous.

1027
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,509
Dangerous, man.

1028
00:45:29,553 --> 00:45:31,555
I mean, next thing you know,
every mayonnaise-eating

1029
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,557
motherfucker and his cousin
will be out here

1030
00:45:33,601 --> 00:45:35,516
like a truffle pig
horning in on our action.

1031
00:45:36,647 --> 00:45:38,345
I ain't from around
these parts.

1032
00:45:38,824 --> 00:45:40,521
I can't afford
another partnership.

1033
00:45:40,564 --> 00:45:42,392
I got to keep a lid on this,
tight.

1034
00:45:43,437 --> 00:45:46,266
Anyways, I'm only looking
for five, six grand cash, tops,

1035
00:45:46,309 --> 00:45:47,571
to push me through.

1036
00:45:49,138 --> 00:45:50,139
Ah!

1037
00:45:52,228 --> 00:45:54,448
Hey, Frankie, I'll scare it up.

1038
00:45:55,014 --> 00:45:56,145
Believe me.

1039
00:45:57,538 --> 00:45:58,626
Thanks anyway.

1040
00:45:59,888 --> 00:46:00,628
-No problem.
-Appreciate the offer, really.

1041
00:46:01,411 --> 00:46:02,804
No, it means a lot to me.

1042
00:46:09,419 --> 00:46:11,944
You know, doing turn-away
business as I suspect,

1043
00:46:11,987 --> 00:46:13,554
maybe I could use a guy
like you.

1044
00:46:14,729 --> 00:46:15,991
Free me up a bit.

1045
00:46:18,515 --> 00:46:20,517
You know, I don't wanna
wind you up or nothing,

1046
00:46:20,561 --> 00:46:22,171
but if things
work out well for me,

1047
00:46:23,433 --> 00:46:25,609
maybe you lucked in
to something good.

1048
00:46:35,445 --> 00:46:36,446
Remember.

1049
00:46:38,753 --> 00:46:41,712
This stands for something
other than itself.

1050
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:50,634
[laughs]
Oh, Frankie.

1051
00:46:55,683 --> 00:46:56,727
Yes!

1052
00:46:58,425 --> 00:47:00,383
-You believe any of that shit?
-Like what?

1053
00:47:00,427 --> 00:47:02,733
You know, soul mate,
life partner.

1054
00:47:02,777 --> 00:47:05,127
[laughs] All that crap,
you know,

1055
00:47:05,171 --> 00:47:06,694
because to me it's all

1056
00:47:06,737 --> 00:47:10,132
so hocus-pocus, you know?
Life, especially my life,

1057
00:47:10,176 --> 00:47:11,699
it's a roll of the dice,
you know?

1058
00:47:11,742 --> 00:47:13,875
Sometimes you win the bear,
sometimes you don't.

1059
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,050
-It's true.
-Right?

1060
00:47:15,094 --> 00:47:16,747
What, you planning
on settling down?

1061
00:47:16,791 --> 00:47:19,489
Well, you know,
can you picture it?

1062
00:47:19,925 --> 00:47:21,665
I think I might.

1063
00:47:21,709 --> 00:47:23,580
I think I'm gonna--
I'm gonna try, you know.

1064
00:47:23,624 --> 00:47:25,844
Have a few kids.
Raise a family.

1065
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:27,628
My family.

1066
00:47:27,671 --> 00:47:28,672
Just be patient.

1067
00:47:30,587 --> 00:47:32,067
It's got to be a hell
of an undertaking.

1068
00:47:32,111 --> 00:47:33,112
Don't you think?

1069
00:47:38,944 --> 00:47:40,946
[Truby] Oh. [chuckles]

1070
00:47:43,513 --> 00:47:45,602
Look at that.
Look at that, huh?

1071
00:47:45,646 --> 00:47:47,866
What a beauty.
Here we go.

1072
00:47:47,909 --> 00:47:50,477
Come, come, come, come, come.

1073
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,262
Look at that, look at--
So beautiful.

1074
00:47:54,742 --> 00:47:59,138
Claire, um, I want you to meet--
Uh, this is one of my oldest

1075
00:47:59,181 --> 00:48:01,880
and dearest friends,
Teddy Finn.

1076
00:48:01,923 --> 00:48:03,490
Teddy Finn, this is Claire.

1077
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:06,449
Now, just do me
one favor, okay?

1078
00:48:06,493 --> 00:48:08,190
Whatever you do,
under no circumstances,

1079
00:48:08,234 --> 00:48:11,106
do not look
at what is behind Teddy

1080
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:12,499
right on the car,
right behind Ted.

1081
00:48:12,542 --> 00:48:14,544
Don't-- Do not look, okay?

1082
00:48:14,588 --> 00:48:16,111
-Because you might--
-What are you doing?

1083
00:48:16,155 --> 00:48:18,070
Because who knows
what you might...

1084
00:48:18,809 --> 00:48:19,549
Oh.

1085
00:48:21,029 --> 00:48:22,465
[Truby] Okay, that's...

1086
00:48:22,509 --> 00:48:25,642
This-- Claire, this is for you.

1087
00:48:25,686 --> 00:48:27,166
-Truby, I--
-It's all for you.

1088
00:48:27,209 --> 00:48:28,776
-Really, I don't want a gift.
-Oh, no, no.

1089
00:48:28,819 --> 00:48:30,909
I want you to have it.
I want you to have it.

1090
00:48:33,389 --> 00:48:34,695
Here you go.

1091
00:48:39,395 --> 00:48:43,008
-Um...
-So, uh, tear it open.

1092
00:48:43,965 --> 00:48:47,186
Hey, that's nice--
Very nice to have met you.

1093
00:48:47,229 --> 00:48:48,578
Oh, yeah. That's-- Oh.

1094
00:48:49,014 --> 00:48:50,189
[Truby] I got it, I got it.

1095
00:48:50,232 --> 00:48:51,146
You got it? He's got it.

1096
00:48:52,278 --> 00:48:54,106
It was really nice
meeting you, too.

1097
00:48:54,149 --> 00:48:55,585
[Teddy] He's a great guy.

1098
00:48:57,022 --> 00:48:58,023
Got to go!

1099
00:49:01,548 --> 00:49:02,984
[Smitty]
I tell you where Billy Clooton's

1100
00:49:03,028 --> 00:49:04,246
place was, Whitey.

1101
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:05,987
It was in Brown's Mills.

1102
00:49:07,075 --> 00:49:08,859
You walked in there
with a dollar,

1103
00:49:08,903 --> 00:49:09,860
you had the world.

1104
00:49:10,992 --> 00:49:13,342
And, boy, was he good
with his mitts.

1105
00:49:14,865 --> 00:49:17,520
Beat the shit out of Frank
De Brosas one night.

1106
00:49:18,695 --> 00:49:20,784
Made quite a few friends
in here when he did.

1107
00:49:22,177 --> 00:49:23,787
Never told her I...

1108
00:49:24,745 --> 00:49:26,225
knew about him though.

1109
00:49:27,748 --> 00:49:28,749
Who's that?

1110
00:49:29,532 --> 00:49:30,664
[Smitty] Frank De Brosas.

1111
00:49:31,926 --> 00:49:33,972
All my years I'd been faithful.

1112
00:49:35,451 --> 00:49:37,801
Not so much as look
at another broad.

1113
00:49:39,629 --> 00:49:42,328
1953, over on Fern Boulevard,

1114
00:49:44,286 --> 00:49:47,159
we lived above Growser's
Pharmaceutical.

1115
00:49:47,202 --> 00:49:50,031
Soda shop,
she worked the fountains there.

1116
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:55,906
Used to see 'em strolling
along Superior Avenue,

1117
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:57,604
wanted to tear off
after them,

1118
00:49:57,647 --> 00:49:59,823
kick the Italian half to death.

1119
00:50:01,956 --> 00:50:05,438
I didn't do it. Lost my nerve.

1120
00:50:05,481 --> 00:50:06,439
[sighs]

1121
00:50:08,093 --> 00:50:11,792
I'll only admit this to you...
now, Whitey.

1122
00:50:12,967 --> 00:50:17,189
Only now.
I thought if I did that,

1123
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,801
I'd lose her, okay?

1124
00:50:21,628 --> 00:50:23,021
So, I let it go on.

1125
00:50:27,112 --> 00:50:29,592
She thought it had to do
with her getting old.

1126
00:50:29,636 --> 00:50:32,726
She cried for every new line
across her face.

1127
00:50:34,641 --> 00:50:36,860
I tried to tell her,
"You look good to me."

1128
00:50:40,386 --> 00:50:41,648
I guess it wasn't enough.

1129
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:47,523
After the Italian
was another guy

1130
00:50:47,567 --> 00:50:52,441
and after him
some Hungarian fella.

1131
00:50:54,356 --> 00:50:56,489
Plus, I'd gotten pretty well
to drinking

1132
00:50:56,532 --> 00:50:57,881
and all by then, so...

1133
00:51:01,668 --> 00:51:02,843
Just upped and left.

1134
00:51:07,978 --> 00:51:09,284
It wasn't right.

1135
00:51:14,985 --> 00:51:16,117
[Whitey] How come?

1136
00:51:18,989 --> 00:51:20,904
Because I never saw her again.

1137
00:51:25,822 --> 00:51:28,651
You know,
I hate to think of her.

1138
00:51:30,523 --> 00:51:33,091
Spending her days
like some old whore.

1139
00:51:33,656 --> 00:51:35,267
Lying in a filthy bed.

1140
00:51:36,398 --> 00:51:38,705
Crying about the one
that slipped away.

1141
00:51:40,968 --> 00:51:42,361
All the while, I'm...

1142
00:51:44,406 --> 00:51:47,192
clinging to some fake memory
of a beautiful...

1143
00:51:50,064 --> 00:51:50,934
beautiful...

1144
00:51:53,067 --> 00:51:56,549
28-year-old girl
working the soda fountain.

1145
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,117
Making a lime rickey.

1146
00:52:02,685 --> 00:52:03,686
[sighs]

1147
00:52:07,168 --> 00:52:08,822
Pinkest blouse you ever seen.

1148
00:52:18,223 --> 00:52:19,224
I let her down.

1149
00:52:34,282 --> 00:52:35,849
[Whitey] Maybe
you let each other down.

1150
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:46,599
[chuckles]

1151
00:52:48,992 --> 00:52:51,038
[crying] Billy Clooton...

1152
00:52:51,952 --> 00:52:54,172
whipped his ass up
in a terrible way.

1153
00:52:54,563 --> 00:52:56,348
[laughing]

1154
00:52:56,391 --> 00:52:57,827
You should've seen him.

1155
00:52:59,264 --> 00:53:02,397
[laughing]

1156
00:53:23,897 --> 00:53:26,029
[Joe] As sure as
God makes green apples,

1157
00:53:26,073 --> 00:53:28,423
you're gonna get all
my fucking money back to me.

1158
00:53:28,467 --> 00:53:29,729
-[laughter]
-Got that?

1159
00:53:30,077 --> 00:53:32,297
Because I'll fucking
put your lights out, kid.

1160
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:35,430
Yeah. Tell Chubby
the same thing, okay?

1161
00:53:35,865 --> 00:53:38,607
[laughter]

1162
00:53:43,351 --> 00:53:44,744
[indistinct chatter]

1163
00:53:44,787 --> 00:53:47,834
[bowling pins crashing]

1164
00:54:14,121 --> 00:54:15,165
[mutters]

1165
00:54:17,342 --> 00:54:18,517
My God.

1166
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,258
[chuckles]

1167
00:54:39,712 --> 00:54:41,366
-[Joe] What's up?
-[Frankie] Okay.

1168
00:54:41,409 --> 00:54:44,586
Um, you told me once, if I
ever had anything, you know,

1169
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:46,414
that was interesting,
that I should...

1170
00:54:46,762 --> 00:54:48,155
Well, I got this thing, right?

1171
00:54:48,198 --> 00:54:50,549
And it's, uh, on paper,
it just looks good.

1172
00:54:50,592 --> 00:54:52,855
It just looks so good,
it bring tears to your eye.

1173
00:54:52,899 --> 00:54:55,467
You wanna put down a move
and you want me

1174
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:57,164
to float you the cash,
right?

1175
00:54:57,207 --> 00:54:59,166
Yeah, I don't want you
to lend it to me.

1176
00:54:59,209 --> 00:55:00,298
It's just I need to borrow it.

1177
00:55:01,429 --> 00:55:02,909
For a couple of days, you know.

1178
00:55:02,952 --> 00:55:05,303
For, like, show purposes,
you know?

1179
00:55:06,521 --> 00:55:08,349
You just fall out
of your mom's ass?

1180
00:55:08,393 --> 00:55:09,959
[laughter]

1181
00:55:10,003 --> 00:55:12,135
On this side,
we don't do things like that.

1182
00:55:12,788 --> 00:55:14,137
What's the knock down?

1183
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:16,096
What's your end?

1184
00:55:16,749 --> 00:55:20,013
Well, uh, it's kind of
hard to say, really.

1185
00:55:20,535 --> 00:55:21,536
[laughter]

1186
00:55:22,276 --> 00:55:23,538
I like to, kid,

1187
00:55:23,582 --> 00:55:25,366
only my business dick says no.

1188
00:55:27,194 --> 00:55:29,152
It's the future, Joe.
There's money in it.

1189
00:55:29,762 --> 00:55:32,242
Yeah, there's money
in payphones too, Frankie,

1190
00:55:32,286 --> 00:55:34,157
only I don't see you
getting any of it.

1191
00:55:34,419 --> 00:55:35,724
Shit outta luck, kid.

1192
00:55:36,595 --> 00:55:38,031
Sorry, I can't help you.

1193
00:55:40,729 --> 00:55:41,730
[tires screech]

1194
00:55:43,123 --> 00:55:44,951
[man] We're fucked?
The motherfucker fucked us.

1195
00:55:46,256 --> 00:55:47,997
You mind telling me
what you're talking about?

1196
00:55:49,216 --> 00:55:51,218
[man] Bogus money,
funny money, shit money.

1197
00:55:51,871 --> 00:55:53,916
There's 87 guys
over at Starbright Vending

1198
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,265
and they all want
their money back.

1199
00:55:55,788 --> 00:55:58,007
Oh, Daniels gave me that. $280.

1200
00:55:58,051 --> 00:56:00,793
He wants it to be turned dollar
for fucking dollar today.

1201
00:56:01,968 --> 00:56:03,709
How big did we get hit?

1202
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:05,798
[man] It'll be all over town
by sundown.

1203
00:56:07,103 --> 00:56:09,018
People have been waiting
for this for a long time.

1204
00:56:10,846 --> 00:56:12,935
I should've known it
the minute he didn't split aces.

1205
00:56:13,283 --> 00:56:14,981
I didn't fucking react.

1206
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:16,591
The boxer?

1207
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:18,811
Pretty little young fuck.

1208
00:56:18,854 --> 00:56:20,987
For his life, he couldn't cover
a two-dollar bet.

1209
00:56:21,248 --> 00:56:22,684
There's a night
he comes in there

1210
00:56:22,728 --> 00:56:23,859
like a nigger
with a hit record.

1211
00:56:24,469 --> 00:56:26,645
Doubling down,
betting stacks of blacks.

1212
00:56:27,297 --> 00:56:28,864
Had to be him,
who else could it have been?

1213
00:56:30,518 --> 00:56:32,302
I'll beat ten motherfuckers.

1214
00:56:33,869 --> 00:56:35,654
Isn't this some shit?

1215
00:56:36,611 --> 00:56:38,308
Isn't this some fucking shit?

1216
00:56:41,224 --> 00:56:42,400
[car engine starts]

1217
00:56:42,965 --> 00:56:43,966
That's it?

1218
00:56:44,227 --> 00:56:45,751
She just said
she didn't want it?

1219
00:56:47,448 --> 00:56:50,059
It was the way she said it.

1220
00:56:50,103 --> 00:56:52,148
The way she said it,
like she has no fucking

1221
00:56:52,192 --> 00:56:53,454
regard for me.

1222
00:56:53,498 --> 00:56:56,109
I did nothing to her
but treat this girl right.

1223
00:56:57,763 --> 00:56:59,547
-Nothing.
-I know.

1224
00:57:00,287 --> 00:57:05,684
So, maybe you ought to,
you know, let it go.

1225
00:57:06,206 --> 00:57:07,425
Let what go?

1226
00:57:07,468 --> 00:57:08,208
Her.

1227
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:10,428
What?

1228
00:57:11,733 --> 00:57:14,301
She doesn't wanna go out
with you anymore, okay?

1229
00:57:16,172 --> 00:57:18,305
She-- You know,
you can't fit a square peg--

1230
00:57:18,348 --> 00:57:21,308
-I'm so fucking square?
-Square peg, man.

1231
00:57:21,351 --> 00:57:23,005
-What?
-I don't need a kissing lesson,

1232
00:57:23,049 --> 00:57:24,442
-okay, Teddy?
-Oh, fuck it.

1233
00:57:25,573 --> 00:57:27,096
Truby, calm down, man.

1234
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:28,489
You're getting your balls up
over nothing.

1235
00:57:28,533 --> 00:57:30,448
You know,
she ain't the end of the world.

1236
00:57:32,058 --> 00:57:34,016
-Jesus Christ.
-How is it that

1237
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:35,453
I've been smothering you,
exactly?

1238
00:57:36,541 --> 00:57:39,239
-What?
-Can you tell me that, please?

1239
00:57:39,282 --> 00:57:42,677
How is it that I have been
smothering you?

1240
00:57:43,112 --> 00:57:45,201
Look, Truby, I can't get
into this right now, okay?

1241
00:57:45,245 --> 00:57:46,725
[Truby] All you need to get into

1242
00:57:46,768 --> 00:57:49,292
is how have I
been smothering you?

1243
00:57:51,773 --> 00:57:54,428
Look, you're a very nice guy.

1244
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:57,562
No, you're such-- You are--
You're such a nice guy,

1245
00:57:57,605 --> 00:58:00,303
but I'm sorry
if you misinterpreted anything.

1246
00:58:00,565 --> 00:58:02,784
I am not a nice guy.
Do you feel sorry for me?

1247
00:58:02,828 --> 00:58:04,786
Is this what this is?
You feel sorry for me?

1248
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:06,048
-[manager] Claire.
-Did I ask...

1249
00:58:06,092 --> 00:58:06,919
-[bell rings]
-Claire, pick up.

1250
00:58:08,094 --> 00:58:09,312
Look, you're gonna
get me fired, okay?

1251
00:58:09,356 --> 00:58:11,140
You know what?
I'm trying to be nice here.

1252
00:58:11,184 --> 00:58:12,751
Can you tell him
to shut the fuck up?

1253
00:58:13,229 --> 00:58:14,796
-I'll take care of this.
-Oh, you walking away?

1254
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,232
You're walking away?

1255
00:58:16,276 --> 00:58:18,539
I'm talking to you.
I'm talking to you right here.

1256
00:58:18,583 --> 00:58:20,149
We're talking right here.
This is talking.

1257
00:58:20,193 --> 00:58:22,761
-[manager] Claire...
-Hey! Asshole!

1258
00:58:22,804 --> 00:58:24,806
Fuck you.
Can you not see right here

1259
00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:26,547
I am talking to the lady?

1260
00:58:26,591 --> 00:58:28,157
You stay there,
you stay there.

1261
00:58:28,201 --> 00:58:29,724
-Come on.
-[manager] You stay there.

1262
00:58:29,768 --> 00:58:31,726
-Come on, Popeye, come on.
-[manager] You stay there.

1263
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:33,554
-Fuck you, come on.
-You know I won't say

1264
00:58:33,598 --> 00:58:35,077
-fuck you, man.
-Oh, yes.

1265
00:58:35,121 --> 00:58:37,602
-You never say "fuck" to me!
-Fuck you, you-- Fuck you!

1266
00:58:37,645 --> 00:58:39,342
-[apron tears]
-Never say "fuck" to me!

1267
00:58:39,386 --> 00:58:40,996
-[Claire shouting indistinctly]
-Motherfucker!

1268
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,956
-[Truby] This is America, pal!
-I don't need any of you.

1269
00:58:44,434 --> 00:58:46,088
I'm a fucking American!

1270
00:58:46,132 --> 00:58:48,308
Okay, calm down.
Truby, come on, man.

1271
00:58:48,351 --> 00:58:49,527
Come on.

1272
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:51,006
[panting]

1273
00:58:51,311 --> 00:58:52,225
Calm down.

1274
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,316
[panting]

1275
00:58:58,492 --> 00:59:01,887
-You got that?
-Calm down.

1276
00:59:05,978 --> 00:59:06,979
-Truby?
-[door opens, closes]

1277
00:59:07,022 --> 00:59:08,197
Hey, Truby!

1278
00:59:09,634 --> 00:59:10,809
Son of a bitch...

1279
00:59:10,852 --> 00:59:12,680
-He's your friend?
-Yeah.

1280
00:59:13,028 --> 00:59:15,204
-He's crazy.
-Everybody's crazy.

1281
00:59:18,033 --> 00:59:19,252
You're crazy, too.

1282
00:59:19,992 --> 00:59:20,993
It's over.

1283
00:59:22,168 --> 00:59:24,126
It's over. The fight's over.

1284
00:59:24,605 --> 00:59:25,824
Yeah, well,
I don't even know

1285
00:59:25,867 --> 00:59:27,347
why I'm taking a bet
this small, Phil.

1286
00:59:28,696 --> 00:59:30,437
All right. If we're doing
the points, I'll add.

1287
00:59:30,959 --> 00:59:31,830
[phone beeps]

1288
00:59:33,048 --> 00:59:34,789
Vikki, did Phil call here
for me today?

1289
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:36,617
[Vikki]
You were out getting a six pack.

1290
00:59:39,664 --> 00:59:40,665
What are you doing?

1291
00:59:46,453 --> 00:59:48,194
I'm gonna be staying
with my sister, Bonnie,

1292
00:59:48,237 --> 00:59:49,369
and her kids for a few weeks.

1293
00:59:51,501 --> 00:59:53,286
There's just a few things
I need to work out.

1294
00:59:56,855 --> 00:59:57,856
Wait a minute. What--

1295
00:59:58,552 --> 01:00:00,380
Relax, I mean...
[scoffs]

1296
01:00:00,423 --> 01:00:02,425
Look, Connie, I know
we've been under the gun lately,

1297
01:00:02,469 --> 01:00:03,644
you know, it's just, uh,

1298
01:00:03,688 --> 01:00:05,167
we've gotta get through
this bullshit

1299
01:00:05,646 --> 01:00:07,474
and we'll be able to live
like people again.

1300
01:00:07,517 --> 01:00:08,518
That's all.

1301
01:00:09,955 --> 01:00:13,262
Bobby, I don't really even know
who we are anymore.

1302
01:00:14,133 --> 01:00:16,178
Or who we ever were
for that matter.

1303
01:00:17,484 --> 01:00:19,225
On Saturday,
Molly's gonna stand up

1304
01:00:19,268 --> 01:00:20,835
on that altar
and she's gonna promise

1305
01:00:20,879 --> 01:00:22,620
to love Jack
for the rest of her life.

1306
01:00:23,795 --> 01:00:24,970
And I think...

1307
01:00:26,449 --> 01:00:29,104
I'd like to be able
to do that myself one day.

1308
01:00:30,715 --> 01:00:32,499
It's just a whole lot of things
going on, that's all.

1309
01:00:34,806 --> 01:00:35,807
Like what?

1310
01:00:37,722 --> 01:00:38,505
[scoffs]

1311
01:00:38,897 --> 01:00:39,898
Like...

1312
01:00:41,203 --> 01:00:42,683
Like when I think back
and I remember how hard

1313
01:00:42,727 --> 01:00:44,511
my mother worked

1314
01:00:44,554 --> 01:00:46,818
and struggled to raise six kids
without a husband.

1315
01:00:48,471 --> 01:00:51,605
And now that nobody's
on drugs or in jail, I think

1316
01:00:52,171 --> 01:00:54,521
how hard and tough that must
have been for her, you know?

1317
01:00:55,870 --> 01:00:58,568
To lead a decent life...
And she did it.

1318
01:00:59,744 --> 01:01:00,527
We did it.

1319
01:01:04,139 --> 01:01:05,663
I'm better than this, Bobby.

1320
01:01:06,751 --> 01:01:09,275
And I thought you were too.

1321
01:01:12,017 --> 01:01:13,714
And I'm not
walking away from you,

1322
01:01:13,758 --> 01:01:15,498
I'm just not gonna walk away
from myself anymore.

1323
01:01:16,761 --> 01:01:19,546
-Vikki, I just think--
-No. Don't say a word.

1324
01:01:20,765 --> 01:01:23,115
And let's keep this a secret
until after the wedding, okay?

1325
01:01:24,072 --> 01:01:25,378
We had our dance.

1326
01:01:26,205 --> 01:01:27,685
Now, let Jack and Molly
have theirs.

1327
01:01:29,861 --> 01:01:30,862
[sniffs]

1328
01:01:33,081 --> 01:01:34,082
[Vikki cries]

1329
01:01:36,519 --> 01:01:38,521
[indistinct chatter]

1330
01:01:40,828 --> 01:01:42,308
[music playing]

1331
01:01:57,932 --> 01:01:59,412
You still there?

1332
01:01:59,934 --> 01:02:00,935
[clears throat]

1333
01:02:02,632 --> 01:02:04,286
Luke still going out
with Laura?

1334
01:02:05,070 --> 01:02:06,462
Oh, they broke up?

1335
01:02:06,506 --> 01:02:09,204
That's sad.
They seemed so tight.

1336
01:02:10,771 --> 01:02:13,382
Look, I'm really sorry
about today.

1337
01:02:13,426 --> 01:02:15,733
You know, thanks for, you know,

1338
01:02:15,776 --> 01:02:17,125
helping me out
and stuff, you know.

1339
01:02:17,169 --> 01:02:18,779
Oh, no big deal.

1340
01:02:18,823 --> 01:02:19,911
Are you all right?

1341
01:02:19,954 --> 01:02:21,347
[Claire] Yeah, I'm fine.

1342
01:02:21,826 --> 01:02:22,914
Fine.

1343
01:02:22,957 --> 01:02:24,350
I used to be fine too, you know.

1344
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:28,136
Fucked up, insecure,
neurotic and empty.

1345
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:30,138
[chuckles]

1346
01:02:31,618 --> 01:02:33,098
[Teddy] I didn't like
being fine, though.

1347
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:35,535
No?
So, you're not anymore?

1348
01:02:38,016 --> 01:02:39,669
Hey, you know,
you look okay to me.

1349
01:02:40,105 --> 01:02:41,584
-[Teddy] Really?
-Mm-hmm.

1350
01:02:42,237 --> 01:02:43,630
You ought to see me in my cape.

1351
01:02:44,239 --> 01:02:46,198
You ought to see me
in my glass slippers.

1352
01:02:46,241 --> 01:02:47,590
Oh, I'd like to.

1353
01:02:49,418 --> 01:02:50,811
-So, about Truby--
-[Claire] Hey.

1354
01:02:50,855 --> 01:02:52,595
Hey, I know he's your friend
and everything.

1355
01:02:52,639 --> 01:02:54,293
I know, I know, um,
he overrates things.

1356
01:02:54,336 --> 01:02:55,773
He's a great guy, though.

1357
01:02:55,816 --> 01:02:57,296
He's one of the greatest guys
that ever walked

1358
01:02:57,339 --> 01:02:58,819
the face of the earth,
you know,

1359
01:02:58,863 --> 01:03:00,473
he just hasn't walked
very far on it.

1360
01:03:01,387 --> 01:03:03,215
Well, those simple guys
who don't have

1361
01:03:03,258 --> 01:03:05,565
all those simple answers but...

1362
01:03:06,087 --> 01:03:08,002
it's part of their charm,
though, I guess.

1363
01:03:08,873 --> 01:03:09,917
I guess so.

1364
01:03:10,483 --> 01:03:12,050
[Teddy]
It's the whacked dudes like us

1365
01:03:12,093 --> 01:03:13,878
that keep the world
all screwed up.

1366
01:03:13,921 --> 01:03:14,792
[both laugh]

1367
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:18,491
No, trust me, man.
It's over with her.

1368
01:03:19,884 --> 01:03:21,886
She'll never see me again.

1369
01:03:22,147 --> 01:03:23,975
She really blew a gasket on you,
huh?

1370
01:03:24,714 --> 01:03:25,759
Mm-hmm.

1371
01:03:27,543 --> 01:03:28,718
Does she have
a forwarding address?

1372
01:03:31,591 --> 01:03:34,159
But you got her
phone number, right?

1373
01:03:37,597 --> 01:03:39,207
Do you know her last name?

1374
01:03:42,776 --> 01:03:44,169
Yeah, I can, um...

1375
01:03:44,734 --> 01:03:46,606
I can see how you'd be
all broke up about that.

1376
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:48,869
You'll be all right.

1377
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:50,218
What are you doing?

1378
01:03:51,393 --> 01:03:53,265
I'm making a list of my enemies.

1379
01:03:53,961 --> 01:03:55,484
I could be here
for quite some time.

1380
01:04:00,446 --> 01:04:02,448
-Hey, Frankie?
-Mm?

1381
01:04:02,491 --> 01:04:04,406
Put this in the safe for me,
will you?

1382
01:04:06,017 --> 01:04:07,322
Watch it.

1383
01:04:07,366 --> 01:04:10,195
-[thud]
-Oh... [sighs]

1384
01:04:11,152 --> 01:04:12,850
[Whitey] Maybe that'll
knock some sense into you.

1385
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:21,423
Hey, Whitey, you, uh...
You know about that?

1386
01:04:23,121 --> 01:04:25,297
That's the, uh,
balance for the caterer.

1387
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:27,168
For Gumbrowski,
for the wedding.

1388
01:04:27,212 --> 01:04:28,213
I got to drop it off.

1389
01:04:29,736 --> 01:04:31,042
Oh, shit.
I'm going out there tomorrow.

1390
01:04:31,085 --> 01:04:32,478
I can take it out,
I'm getting my brakes done,

1391
01:04:32,521 --> 01:04:33,827
it's just across the street.

1392
01:04:34,306 --> 01:04:35,785
-[Whitey] Your brakes went out?
-Yeah.

1393
01:04:37,483 --> 01:04:40,138
No, that's a lot of money.
I'll take it myself.

1394
01:04:41,748 --> 01:04:43,793
What? You're gonna go
30 minutes out of your way

1395
01:04:43,837 --> 01:04:45,143
when I'll already be there?
Come on.

1396
01:04:47,362 --> 01:04:53,064
Well, that's, uh,
four big ones in there, Frankie.

1397
01:04:54,456 --> 01:04:55,936
You know
what you're doing, yeah?

1398
01:04:57,111 --> 01:04:58,112
Yeah.

1399
01:04:59,679 --> 01:05:00,549
[exhales]

1400
01:05:04,989 --> 01:05:05,990
Okey-doke.

1401
01:05:06,991 --> 01:05:08,166
That's done.

1402
01:05:09,689 --> 01:05:11,691
[Truby] So, uh, I was..

1403
01:05:11,734 --> 01:05:12,953
[Whitey] What's with you?

1404
01:05:13,867 --> 01:05:16,174
I was just--
I was just thinking that

1405
01:05:16,217 --> 01:05:19,003
you should...
You should, you know,

1406
01:05:19,046 --> 01:05:20,656
I think you should probably
know something.

1407
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:22,267
You think
I should know something?

1408
01:05:22,310 --> 01:05:23,616
Yeah.

1409
01:05:23,659 --> 01:05:25,226
Everything's, you know--
It's no big deal.

1410
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:26,706
Everything's...

1411
01:05:27,315 --> 01:05:30,231
just cool beans and...

1412
01:05:30,275 --> 01:05:31,841
Well, what the hell
is it, all right?

1413
01:05:31,885 --> 01:05:32,625
Spit it out.

1414
01:05:34,627 --> 01:05:35,628
It's Teddy Finn.

1415
01:05:37,325 --> 01:05:38,979
Teddy Finn is back in town.

1416
01:05:39,588 --> 01:05:43,592
He's at the church,
but, you know, everything's...

1417
01:05:44,071 --> 01:05:44,942
Everything's cool.

1418
01:05:46,421 --> 01:05:47,727
[clears throat]
He's at the church.

1419
01:06:06,572 --> 01:06:08,226
I got a cousin near Butler...

1420
01:06:09,488 --> 01:06:11,664
so maybe I'll bus down there.

1421
01:06:13,013 --> 01:06:15,146
I'm-- Actually,
I'm thinking Saturday now.

1422
01:06:16,277 --> 01:06:17,322
I really do wanna...

1423
01:06:18,714 --> 01:06:20,064
wish you the best of luck,
Claire, because it...

1424
01:06:20,629 --> 01:06:22,283
really is a long waltz,

1425
01:06:22,327 --> 01:06:24,242
no matter who it is
you're dancing with.

1426
01:06:25,286 --> 01:06:27,767
It took me a long time to
find out the tail I was chasing

1427
01:06:28,942 --> 01:06:30,596
wasn't really attached to a dog.

1428
01:06:31,858 --> 01:06:33,555
It wasn't really attached
to anything.

1429
01:06:34,078 --> 01:06:34,687
[chuckles]

1430
01:06:38,691 --> 01:06:40,345
Um, they're expecting
sleet tonight.

1431
01:06:40,388 --> 01:06:41,955
I got to get up early.

1432
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:44,001
I got to salt the walk
for the parishioners.

1433
01:06:44,044 --> 01:06:45,698
To keep them happy. You know.

1434
01:06:45,741 --> 01:06:47,830
Got to-- Got to serve
somebody, I guess.

1435
01:06:49,484 --> 01:06:53,097
So, um, if you, uh, you know,
wanna give me a call, um,

1436
01:06:53,358 --> 01:06:55,186
over there before you leave.
I don't know.

1437
01:06:57,275 --> 01:06:59,146
You know,
maybe get a cup of coffee.

1438
01:06:59,494 --> 01:07:02,236
That is, if you know
some place that serves coffee.

1439
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,107
[chuckles]

1440
01:07:04,543 --> 01:07:05,848
Look, I got to split.
[clears throat]

1441
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:14,901
[door opens]

1442
01:08:07,127 --> 01:08:07,997
Hey there, Teddy.

1443
01:08:09,434 --> 01:08:10,522
Hey, Whitey.

1444
01:08:14,352 --> 01:08:15,657
She's, uh...

1445
01:08:16,876 --> 01:08:18,965
moved on with things
and, uh...

1446
01:08:23,796 --> 01:08:25,363
I hope you're gonna
respect that.

1447
01:08:39,768 --> 01:08:41,466
We were good altar boys once.

1448
01:08:42,554 --> 01:08:44,947
Yeah, once upon a time.

1449
01:08:47,167 --> 01:08:48,125
You know...

1450
01:08:50,475 --> 01:08:52,912
the night before I left,
I was over at your house,

1451
01:08:53,608 --> 01:08:54,696
I was, uh...

1452
01:08:56,045 --> 01:08:57,221
I was sitting on that...

1453
01:08:59,092 --> 01:09:00,833
couch glider you got out front.

1454
01:09:01,225 --> 01:09:03,357
[chuckles]

1455
01:09:03,401 --> 01:09:05,490
I flicked down that AM radio
of yours.

1456
01:09:06,186 --> 01:09:07,535
Steam here, it was blowin'.

1457
01:09:08,188 --> 01:09:09,058
And, um...

1458
01:09:10,495 --> 01:09:11,844
I had your sister's hand...

1459
01:09:14,238 --> 01:09:15,543
in mine...

1460
01:09:16,762 --> 01:09:18,155
Saw my future that night.

1461
01:09:20,287 --> 01:09:22,159
Whitey, I didn't
come back here to...

1462
01:09:23,943 --> 01:09:25,510
you know, win your respect...

1463
01:09:27,251 --> 01:09:29,905
because of what I've been
through on my time on the road,

1464
01:09:29,949 --> 01:09:31,472
because it was bullshit.

1465
01:09:32,212 --> 01:09:33,735
But I'd appreciate it
if I don't have to fall on

1466
01:09:33,779 --> 01:09:35,215
anyone's spear...

1467
01:09:36,434 --> 01:09:38,000
to do the things I got to do.

1468
01:09:40,786 --> 01:09:42,875
Just like any decent man,
I just wanna...

1469
01:09:44,442 --> 01:09:45,834
do what's right.

1470
01:09:47,619 --> 01:09:48,924
Get on with things.

1471
01:09:48,968 --> 01:09:49,969
And I thought that...

1472
01:09:50,883 --> 01:09:53,277
you-- you'd understand that.

1473
01:09:56,410 --> 01:09:57,063
[slaps hand]

1474
01:09:59,631 --> 01:10:01,937
It's kind of funny you and me
winding up back

1475
01:10:01,981 --> 01:10:03,112
in a church, huh?

1476
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:06,420
I'm gonna call down
a blessing for you.

1477
01:10:07,291 --> 01:10:09,597
-Yeah, I could use it.
-[chuckles]

1478
01:10:11,295 --> 01:10:12,600
Thanks a lot.

1479
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:16,125
I'll be seeing you around.

1480
01:10:16,691 --> 01:10:17,997
You'll be seeing me around.

1481
01:10:23,263 --> 01:10:25,787
[Paris] They're all 55 series,
the same serial number

1482
01:10:25,831 --> 01:10:27,659
but they've been
spending real nice.

1483
01:10:27,702 --> 01:10:30,314
Particularly at the colleges,
bookstores and shit.

1484
01:10:30,357 --> 01:10:32,490
The only problem is,
the motherfucker I get it from

1485
01:10:32,533 --> 01:10:34,448
works about
as much as Santa Claus.

1486
01:10:35,406 --> 01:10:38,496
So, the next batch I get in,
I got to get 20 points on.

1487
01:10:38,539 --> 01:10:40,672
-Too heavy for you?
-No.

1488
01:10:40,715 --> 01:10:42,108
Chickie said you used to box.

1489
01:10:42,151 --> 01:10:43,675
[Bobby] A long time ago.

1490
01:10:43,718 --> 01:10:45,154
[Paris] Said you ran into
some troubles.

1491
01:10:45,459 --> 01:10:46,721
Kid named Carpenter.

1492
01:10:47,331 --> 01:10:48,680
Why'd you quit?

1493
01:10:48,984 --> 01:10:51,117
I didn't quit.
I got knocked out.

1494
01:10:51,422 --> 01:10:52,858
Marysville, Ohio.

1495
01:10:53,162 --> 01:10:54,903
I had the kid out on his feet.

1496
01:10:54,947 --> 01:10:56,644
He was all opened up.
He didn't even know

1497
01:10:56,688 --> 01:10:57,689
what state he was in.

1498
01:10:57,732 --> 01:10:59,038
You couldn't put him away?

1499
01:10:59,081 --> 01:11:00,605
He was away.
What do you got,

1500
01:11:00,648 --> 01:11:01,693
shit in your ears?

1501
01:11:01,736 --> 01:11:02,911
[laughs]

1502
01:11:03,303 --> 01:11:04,391
But, uh...

1503
01:11:04,696 --> 01:11:07,438
I lost respect, you know,
I got caught.

1504
01:11:08,308 --> 01:11:09,614
Woke up in the eye hospital.

1505
01:11:10,615 --> 01:11:12,443
Wait till you hear what happened
to the other guy.

1506
01:11:12,486 --> 01:11:13,835
You knew him?

1507
01:11:13,879 --> 01:11:15,750
Kenny Carpenter,
from Dayton,

1508
01:11:15,794 --> 01:11:17,099
tattoos up
his fucking arms?

1509
01:11:17,361 --> 01:11:18,623
That's the guy.

1510
01:11:19,014 --> 01:11:21,060
Everybody had a piece
of that motherfucker.

1511
01:11:21,103 --> 01:11:23,367
Kenny never had much sense,
but he had too much sense

1512
01:11:23,410 --> 01:11:24,716
to take that kind of shit.

1513
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:27,849
Wanted to go his own way
so they fucked him.

1514
01:11:28,197 --> 01:11:30,504
Yanked his license,
full amount.

1515
01:11:30,765 --> 01:11:31,766
Where is he at now?

1516
01:11:32,376 --> 01:11:33,333
He's dead.

1517
01:11:33,899 --> 01:11:37,076
[laughs]

1518
01:11:37,119 --> 01:11:39,208
Got his brains blown out
trying to take off

1519
01:11:39,252 --> 01:11:40,862
some tip-and-touch outside
of Cleveland.

1520
01:11:40,906 --> 01:11:43,343
Off-duty cop.
That's going back

1521
01:11:43,387 --> 01:11:44,953
four, five years now, huh?

1522
01:11:45,998 --> 01:11:48,087
Heard he was on the pipe
pretty good, too,

1523
01:11:48,392 --> 01:11:49,697
so I guess it was expected.

1524
01:11:50,829 --> 01:11:53,397
Hey, Mills,
your turn to tell a sad story.

1525
01:11:53,919 --> 01:11:55,660
[Mills]
Yeah, here's my sad story.

1526
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,139
[laughs]

1527
01:12:01,013 --> 01:12:02,884
I need any more of that stuff,
I'll get in touch

1528
01:12:02,928 --> 01:12:04,016
with you through Chickie.

1529
01:12:06,192 --> 01:12:08,325
And remember,
20 points on the next batch.

1530
01:12:09,761 --> 01:12:11,545
I got steroids
if you need them, too!

1531
01:12:11,589 --> 01:12:12,938
Bootleg!

1532
01:12:14,418 --> 01:12:17,508
[laughing]

1533
01:12:19,031 --> 01:12:20,511
Hey, angel eyes.

1534
01:12:20,554 --> 01:12:22,513
Hey, why don't you fix ol',
uh, Billy boy here,

1535
01:12:22,556 --> 01:12:23,514
uh, some spaghetti,

1536
01:12:24,776 --> 01:12:25,777
little coffee,
and give me a little sliver

1537
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:27,387
of that layer cake over there.

1538
01:12:28,170 --> 01:12:29,563
And fix my uncle over here

1539
01:12:29,607 --> 01:12:32,392
a malted and, uh,
bowl of macaronis.

1540
01:12:34,438 --> 01:12:36,048
[music playing]

1541
01:12:39,181 --> 01:12:40,835
What the hell get you
so out of breath,

1542
01:12:40,879 --> 01:12:42,184
you couldn't wait till Monday?

1543
01:12:42,663 --> 01:12:44,448
All right, look,
I know you're busy

1544
01:12:44,491 --> 01:12:46,014
and everything and, you know,

1545
01:12:46,058 --> 01:12:47,451
because you been out there
covering yourself,

1546
01:12:47,494 --> 01:12:49,061
getting your dough together
and all that,

1547
01:12:49,104 --> 01:12:51,063
I just-- You know,
I wanted to show you

1548
01:12:51,106 --> 01:12:53,282
what a guy like me
will be willing to do

1549
01:12:53,326 --> 01:12:56,024
for a guy like you, you know,
in the pitch.

1550
01:12:58,244 --> 01:12:58,984
[mutters]

1551
01:13:09,864 --> 01:13:12,040
"Let him who seeks
continue to seek

1552
01:13:12,606 --> 01:13:14,173
until he finds.

1553
01:13:15,304 --> 01:13:17,829
And when he finds,
he will become troubled.

1554
01:13:20,658 --> 01:13:24,226
And when he becomes troubled,
he will become astonished."

1555

Gospel according

01:36:55,898 --> 01:36:57,987
I know you don't get many
chances in life...

1906
01:36:58,857 --> 01:36:59,815
like us.

1907
01:37:01,077 --> 01:37:02,252
Bobby, don't do this.

1908
01:37:03,688 --> 01:37:04,863
Not now, okay?

1909
01:37:06,647 --> 01:37:08,301
I have to do this now, Vikki.

1910
01:37:09,912 --> 01:37:12,262
I know I love you,
and I think you still love me.

1911
01:37:12,305 --> 01:37:13,306
And...

1912
01:37:16,744 --> 01:37:17,484
And, uh...

1913
01:37:19,312 --> 01:37:21,749
I know I got a lot wrong
with me. I do.

1914
01:37:21,793 --> 01:37:23,621
But it's nothing
that what's right can't fix.

1915
01:37:25,536 --> 01:37:26,885
[sigh]

1916
01:37:29,322 --> 01:37:30,323
Vick.

1917
01:37:33,065 --> 01:37:35,502
I wanna learn to be
your friend again.

1918
01:37:37,940 --> 01:37:38,897
[scoffs]

1919
01:37:40,290 --> 01:37:41,291
Bobby.

1920
01:37:41,944 --> 01:37:43,554
Bobby, Bobby.

1921
01:37:47,950 --> 01:37:49,690
[woman laughs]

1922
01:37:53,259 --> 01:37:54,521
[woman] Bye.

1923
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:57,698
-Yeah.
-[mutters indistinctly]

1924
01:38:02,834 --> 01:38:04,488
[clears throat]

1925
01:38:06,098 --> 01:38:07,534
[chuckles]

1926
01:38:29,339 --> 01:38:31,080
[laughter, indistinct chatter]

1927
01:38:31,123 --> 01:38:32,298
[man] Goodbye, my darling.

1928
01:38:32,559 --> 01:38:33,647
Goodbye.

1929
01:38:33,691 --> 01:38:35,388
[indistinct chatter]

1930
01:38:35,432 --> 01:38:36,737
[man] Be careful
with your dress...

1931
01:38:36,781 --> 01:38:38,130
Truby, come on,
you're killing me! Hey!

1932
01:38:38,391 --> 01:38:39,827
That's a brand new suit, man!

1933
01:38:39,871 --> 01:38:41,351
[man laughs]

1934
01:38:41,394 --> 01:38:42,918
[man] Careful with the bride!

1935
01:38:45,572 --> 01:38:47,923
[woman] Be good to her!
Be good to her!

1936
01:38:49,707 --> 01:38:50,708
Good luck!

1937
01:38:52,405 --> 01:38:53,929
[bird chirping]

1938
01:38:54,364 --> 01:38:57,715
[horn honking]

1939
01:39:20,607 --> 01:39:22,479
[Smitty] They say
a bar is a place

1940
01:39:22,522 --> 01:39:23,959
where people to come together,

1941
01:39:24,872 --> 01:39:26,004
to share things,

1942
01:39:26,787 --> 01:39:27,963
to be thankful,

1943
01:39:28,746 --> 01:39:30,226
to know that they're not alone.

1944
01:39:31,923 --> 01:39:35,013
And I guess it's this everyday
grace of ordinary people

1945
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:37,537
that'll sustain us for now.

1946
01:39:37,798 --> 01:39:39,800
[laughter, indistinct chatter]

1947
01:39:40,062 --> 01:39:43,413
We've awakened to the fact
that we're not young anymore.

1948
01:39:44,457 --> 01:39:46,982
And perhaps our future
is no longer limitless.

1949
01:39:47,852 --> 01:39:49,332
But was it ever?

1950
01:39:50,768 --> 01:39:52,378
Tonight,

1951
01:39:52,422 --> 01:39:54,511
in this tightly-defined
little corner of the world,

1952
01:39:54,946 --> 01:39:57,470
the lights of my father's
bar burn bright,

1953
01:39:58,254 --> 01:40:01,083
because we've come to learn what he must've known all along.

1954
01:40:02,084 --> 01:40:04,782
And that is that life's
not always about

1955
01:40:04,825 --> 01:40:06,044
holding good cards.

1956
01:40:07,654 --> 01:40:10,092
