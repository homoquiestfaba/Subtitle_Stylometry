[water dripping]

3
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,390
ZIGGY: It was dope
living there.

4
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,150
My little getaway where
no one's trippin' on me.

5
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,940
Bustin' Js all night.

6
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,560
Just chillin'.

7
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,130
Tappin' on heaven's door.

8
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,870
Nothin' like Pop's crib.

9
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,610
It was safe there.

10
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,220
And I thought
it would stay that way.

11
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,800
Till it went postal.

12
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,280
[upbeat music playing]

13
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,410
[sirens wailing]

14
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,340
Twenty-three hundred students
at Lincoln that day.

15
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,690
And most of them
didn't care about nothin',

16
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,040
except gettin' over,
gettin' blunted,

17
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,300
and gettin' that ass.

18
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,960
Take Rodney.

19
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,790
He gave a whole new meaning
to "super senior."

20
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,660
Wouldn't even have been there
if Spanky and his boys

21
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,050
weren't trying
to bust a cap in him.

22
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:11,320
You 187, motherfucker!

23
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,190
I want my loot!

24
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,410
Be out here
waiting on your ass all day.

25
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,670
ZIGGY: After six years,

26
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,190
he finally had a reason
to come to school.

27
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,680
[metal detector beeping]

28
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:33,120
Now, Rivers, for him, it
was all about the Benjamins.

29
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,210
POLICEMAN:
That's all you got?

30
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,690
It's gonna be
a beautiful day, sir.

31
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,040
ZIGGY: He wrote the book
on getting over.

32
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:46,960
LYNN: Fuck!

33
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,660
Shit.

34
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,840
Oh, goddamn it.

35
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,660
- ZIGGY: And then, there was Lynn.
- LYNN: Fuck!

36
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,800
Now, she thought she was just
a little sick that day.

37
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,450
But as it turns out,

38
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,150
I guess Jimmy's hat
wasn't wrapped too tight.

39
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,670
[girls laugh]

40
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,160
GIRL 1: So, what did you
have to do, Lynn?

41
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:09,770
Blindfold him?

42
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,640
MAN: Purchase of
prom picture packages, denied.

43
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:21,300
Request for updated
American history books, denied.

44
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,260
Oh, and last but not least,

45
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,650
the motion to organize
a student career day...

46
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,650
ALL: Denied.

47
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,880
ZIGGY: Most guys thought
Stephanie was stuck up.

48
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,270
Truth is, she just wanted
to get out of the 'hood

49
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,620
and never look back.

50
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,660
I hate this school.

51
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,230
Basically, just walk the halls.

52
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,410
Let the kids know
that you're here.

53
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,850
So they understand that breaking
the rules won't be tolerated.

54
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,980
Establish a presence.
Won't be any trouble.

55
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,160
So I'm a deterrent?

56
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,900
ARMSTRONG:
Exactly.

57
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,290
It doesn't work out there,

58
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,810
So what makes you think
it's gonna work in here?

59
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,730
I can imagine what you have
dealt with, Officer Jackson.

60
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,780
Normally, we don't get someone
of your experience in here.

61
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,090
Just remember,
this isn't the streets.

62
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,300
It's a school.

63
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,180
Am I making myself clear?

64
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,790
ZIGGY: Jackson was a five
dollar cop with a $50 attitude.

65
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,490
He wanted to be
anywhere but here.

66
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,050
Trust me, Armstrong.

67
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,880
When things get ugly,

68
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,060
I'll just give 'em an F.

69
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,230
Then I'll call for backup.

70
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,670
ZIGGY: Then there was Lester.

71
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,410
Forty?

72
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,890
Give me the tickets.
I'll get the rest, all right?

73
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,420
Yeah, right, and I'm gonna
have Madonna's next baby.

74
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,120
Look, man, I need some
kinda collateral. Company policy.

75
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,860
How about that watch?

76
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,860
That's no happy meal, bro.

77
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,380
I can't give you
this watch, man.

78
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,030
Look, maybe something else.

79
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,780
Yo, Stephanie.

80
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,210
Lester, whatever it is,
I don't want to hear it.

81
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,610
You want to ride
the space shuttle,

82
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,910
you gotta pay the fuel bill.

83
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,310
All right, how about these?

84
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,660
If you had a gun,
they'd call you a criminal.

85
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,530
ZIGGY: All I gotta say
about Lester is that's my boy.

86
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,750
No matter what,
he always had my back.

87
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,840
[bell rings]

88
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,670
Everybody wanted to blame
what went down on Lester.

89
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,980
Truth be told, he was
the quiet riot in all of us.

90
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,240
Hey, little man, what you doing?

91
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,950
You can't sit here.
You're blocking traffic.

92
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,210
I... I just need to finish this.

93
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,730
I said you can't sit here.

94
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,730
Did you hear the warning bell?

95
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,340
What? Hey, come on.

96
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,690
Move. Get up.

97
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,170
What, man?

98
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,650
I'm just waiting for a friend.

99
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:38,520
What's your name?

100
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,310
Julius Zacharias Malone.

101
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,180
My friends call me Ziggy.

102
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,400
JACKSON: Ziggy?
All right. I'm new here.

103
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,360
But if I tell you to move,
you move, all right?

104
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,750
Yo, Ziggy, you all right?
What's the problem?

105
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,060
Hey, this doesn't
concern you. Step back.

106
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,580
- My friends concern me.
- Everything's cool.

107
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,620
Is that right?

108
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,970
Yeah, that's right.

109
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,060
Come here for a second, son.

110
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,280
I'm not your son.

111
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:58,980
Lester, man, chill out.

112
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,810
- Oh, you like playing games?
- Love 'em.

113
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,290
Good. Here's one
you should know.

114
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,680
Assume the position.

115
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:05,810
What?

116
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,470
I said assume the position.

117
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,420
Man, you trippin'.

118
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,560
[all clamoring]

119
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,340
What's up, Lester?
Man, that's fucked up.

120
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,910
Don't let him put you on the wall
like that. Get the fuck outta here.

121
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,350
This is whack, man.

122
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,960
You cops think just 'cause
you got them pop guns,

123
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,350
you can come around here and
treat people any way you want?

124
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,610
Hey, that's way outta line.
You need to cool it.

125
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,090
Cool it.

126
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,360
[bell rings]

127
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,100
ZIGGY: Yo, there's the bell.

128
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,320
We gotta go.

129
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,100
Come on, Les.

130
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,930
This is the part where
we walk away quietly.

131
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,590
- Right, Officer Jackson?
- Right.

132
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,550
ZIGGY: Thank you, Officer.

133
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,550
Come on.

134
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,110
Come on.

135
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,770
LESTER:
Bitch-ass cops, man.

136
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,380
Yo, dawg, squash that.

137
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,040
Hey, man, you all right?

138
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,300
I'm cool.

139
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:02,170
Hey, uh, yo, I brought
these for you, man.

140
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,960
Keep them hands warm
till you get famous.

141
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,610
Thanks, man.

142
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,870
Hey, man, we late.
Let's go. Come on.

143
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,480
KNOWLES: I know
it's cold in here,

144
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,660
but even a frozen mind
is a terrible thing to waste.

145
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,010
[all groaning, grumbling]

146
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,190
KNOWLES: I was gonna
show you a video today

147
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,020
on the power of the media
in the twentieth century,

148
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,630
But unfortunately...

149
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,110
BOY 1: Look at Iron Mike
with the heavy balls.

150
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,800
[all cheering]

151
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,150
Lester, you rough, kid.

152
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,460
I saw you pulled by
Five-O earlier today.

153
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,850
KNOWLES: Okay,
everybody, settle down.

154
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,770
BOY 2: Badass Lester.

155
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,120
As I was saying, unfortunately,

156
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,990
the VCR is busted, so we're
gonna have to go to Plan B,

157
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,690
which is I talk and you listen.

158
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,690
Just like at home.

159
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,170
KNOWLES: Well, I hope not,
Rivers. I want you to pay attention.

160
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,430
Now, those of you
that have textbooks,

161
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,870
please take them out.

162
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,050
Those of you that don't,
please share with someone

163
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,570
that you don't have
a vendetta against.

164
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,270
BOY 3: It's so cold in here,
man, you can see your sentences.

165
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,660
KNOWLES: Everybody,
come on, now.

166
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,270
Yo, Stephanie, uh...

167
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,540
[shushing]

168
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,360
KNOWLES: I would like you
to turn to page ten.

169
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,930
We have a lot of ground
to cover today.

170
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,240
Media coverage of the social
movement can aid in education...

171
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,290
Yo, you're down with
Lauryn Hill, right?

172
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,200
She's at The Garden this Friday,

173
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,810
and I figured, you know,

174
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,860
it's sold out.

175
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,470
Maybe we could go together.

176
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,560
I can't, Lester.

177
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,470
KNOWLES: Lester.

178
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,430
Stick with me on this.

179
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,480
So, we left off discussing
how the twentieth century

180
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,920
was the first time in history
that the media...

181
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,090
When Wanda and Tanika
heard I had these tickets,

182
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,180
they were sweatin' me.

183
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,620
I said, "Nah.
I'm saving myself."

184
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,840
They said,
"For who, Lester?"

185
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,500
"For whom, Lester?"

186
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,150
KNOWLES: Now,
who else can we say

187
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,850
came to power over the airwaves?

188
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,240
Jerry Springer.

189
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,070
Tupac and Biggie.

190
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,030
Ginger Spice
and Mr. Hankey.

191
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,550
I said, "For the first
woman on the moon."

192
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,340
I said, "For the first
woman senator..."

193
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,130
"From New York."

194
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,040
I said, "For the first
president of the United States"

195
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,740
"who happened
to be Puerto Rican,"

196
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,180
if you know
what I mean, Boricua.

197
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,740
KNOWLES:
...and factions.

198
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,790
Lester, excuse me for wanting
to hold class, but I really...

199
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,750
[glass shatters]

200
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,440
[all clamoring]

201
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,670
Mr. Knowles,
I can't feel my legs.

202
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,280
We could burn some books.

203
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,590
There aren't enough
to keep us warm.

204
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,280
KNOWLES: Let's hunt down
another room.

205
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,200
Everybody, come on.
Let's mount up.

206
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,240
And, Lester, you're with me.

207
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,420
WOMAN: Any more questions?
Rasheed?

208
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,600
KNOWLES:
The library's full too.

209
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,600
Okay, look.

210
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,170
Why don't you people just
hang out here for a while

211
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,300
until our scouts
come back, okay?

212
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,340
[whispers] Quietly, okay?

213
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,260
Hey, hey, hey.
Come here.

214
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,090
Coach Davis told me
that you quit the team.

215
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,740
You're shooting bricks in class.
What's going on?

216
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,480
Nothing, man.

217
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,790
You want me to fail you?

218
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,100
Is that gonna get
your attention?

219
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,710
How's your dad's case going?

220
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,620
Won't be one, man.
Case closed.

221
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,970
They said it was an accident.

222
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,670
Cafeteria's bumper-to-bumper.

223
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,540
Three Classes.

224
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,290
I'm sorry about that.

225
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,500
How's your mom taking it?

226
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,030
- Bad, man. Real bad.
- Look,

227
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,380
why don't you come by and
see me at the end of the day?

228
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,990
We'll go to the gym,

229
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,430
play a little one-on-one.
We'll talk.

230
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:34,950
- Okay?
- Okay.

231
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:36,950
Gym's filled.

232
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,170
How about the auditorium?

233
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,560
Mr. Wittner's class.

234
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,220
This is really messed up,
Mr. Knowles.

235
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,310
[sighs exasperatedly]
Okay.

236
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,130
Okay, people, follow me.

237
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,090
Let's go see
the man behind the curtain.

238
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,090
And I'll cover the other class.

239
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,530
For crying out loud, come on!

240
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,010
I've got close to 35 kids
in each of these classes.

241
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,750
Come on!
Help me out here.

242
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,320
Hey, Allan, you got a minute?

243
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,060
Eleven o'clock, the
superintendent will be here.

244
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,760
Hold on a minute.
You tell him

245
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,370
that if he really wants to help,

246
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,200
to get his butt down here and
take over one of these classes.

247
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,850
Stop monopolizing my time
with this bullshit.

248
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,240
SECRETARY:
Eleven o'clock will be fine.

249
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,900
I know I've troubled you before

250
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,990
for such luxury items
like books and chairs,

251
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,950
but the window is still broken.

252
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,730
Kenny, you know I've been
on the phone for months

253
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,650
talking to downtown,
trying to get windowpanes.

254
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,730
Now, you just...
wait a minute.

255
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,520
Are those your students
out there in the hall?

256
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,560
Yeah. You can ice skate
in my classroom.

257
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,610
We've been everywhere.

258
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,700
No, Kenny, take 'em out. Get 'em
anywhere but in the hall, all right?

259
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,830
Come on, man.
That's a fire hazard.

260
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,050
You know, a fire might be
good here. Warm up the school.

261
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:35,580
Anywhere.

262
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:36,880
[horn honking]

263
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,100
[boys laughing]

264
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:43,060
KNOWLES:
So, with King and Gandhi,

265
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:46,370
we've got these two great minds

266
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,290
on opposite sides of the world

267
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,640
changing the course of history.

268
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,330
For a cheeseburger and fries,

269
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,940
- what do they have in common?
- Stop it!

270
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,420
They're both dead.

271
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,290
- [scattered laughs]
- RIVERS: Mr. Knowles.

272
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,690
KNOWLES: Rivers.

273
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,300
I was just wondering,
if we know the answer,

274
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,950
could we substitute

275
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,740
a combo meal at Mickey D's
instead of this place?

276
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,180
Rivers, if you know the answer,
I'll super-size it.

277
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,570
Why do you even come to school?

278
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,400
Mr. Knowles,
they shared the philosophy

279
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,830
that violence
begets more violence.

280
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,230
KNOWLES: Yes. And?

281
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,540
Um...

282
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,930
BOY: Damn, Mrs. Einstein.

283
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,020
[chuckles] Wait.
You mean she's stumped?

284
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,060
No. I must be
dreaming.

285
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,980
They were murdered, man.

286
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,160
Peaceful resistance
begets violence too.

287
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,460
- KNOWLES: They stood up for what they believed in.
- Hey, Mr. Knowles?

288
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,420
[shotgun cocks]

289
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,340
Lunchtime, motherfuckers!

290
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,340
- And you're buying!
- [screaming]

291
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,380
Put your hands where
I can see 'em right now!

292
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,780
Give me your fucking wallet!

293
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,520
Give me your fucking wallet!

294
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,260
What the fuck do you think
this is, nigga, show and tell?

295
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,350
I like this shit here.

296
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,910
What the fuck we got right here?

297
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,660
I like that piece you're
flossin' on your wrist, nigga.

298
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,400
Why don't you go ahead
and hand that shit over?

299
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,450
Give me the fucking watch, now!

300
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,140
Lester, give it up.

301
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,670
- MUGGER: What the fuck you think this is?
- LESTER: No.

302
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,580
No? Nigga, I got
the fuckin' shotgun!

303
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,450
- BOY: Give it to him!
- Give me the fuckin' watch.

304
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,890
Aaron, is that you?

305
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,630
I said no fucking talking!

306
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,890
Shut the fuck up!

307
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,110
It's Knowles.
I had you in history.

308
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,510
I don't know
who the hell you are.

309
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,990
Now sit the fuck down!

310
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,680
KNOWLES: Hey, I helped you
get into Manual Arts.

311
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,820
It's Ken Knowles.

312
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,300
Mr. Knowles?

313
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,040
[grunts]

314
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,480
[students cheering]

315
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,870
Eight, nine, ten!
He's outta here!

316
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,440
What were you thinking?

317
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,830
Taking them off campus?

318
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,960
There was no place
to go on campus.

319
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,320
I got Perez back there,
the district superintendent.

320
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,620
So what?

321
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,970
This is my pension, man.

322
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,710
Now, you leave me
no other choice.

323
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,190
Call your union rep.
You're suspended.

324
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,760
LESTER: It figures, man.
Knowles does something righteous,

325
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:56,760
and this is how
they talk to him.

326
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,240
What were you thinking?

327
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,760
LESTER:
What do you mean?

328
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,980
You were gonna get
yourself shot over a watch?

329
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,250
Rob.

330
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,730
LYNN: Hey.

331
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,870
ROB: What?

332
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:16,650
LYNN:
We really gotta talk.

333
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,000
ROB: Look, forget it, okay?

334
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,650
I don't want to talk about it.

335
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,480
I don't give...

336
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,000
- [bell rings]
- I'm outta here.

337
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,090
Shit.

338
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,620
Yo, Mr. Knowles,
what's going on?

339
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,060
KNOWLES: Hey, um...

340
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,580
I can't talk right now.
I have to leave.

341
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,630
What? Why?

342
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,890
That's not important. What's important
is that you get on to your next class.

343
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,110
But we have you next period.

344
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,510
- Yeah.
- Right.

345
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,990
Well, um, Armstrong's
gonna get you a sub.

346
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,120
- LESTER: A sub?
- Yeah.

347
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,860
Wait. Yo, Mr. Knowles!

348
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,820
KNOWLES: Sorry, guys.
They won't let me talk to you.

349
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,560
Mr. Knowles!

350
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:55,560
KNOWLES:
I'm really sorry, guys.

351
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,780
Um, Knowles just used
poor judgment.

352
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,390
- [knocking on door]
- That's all. Hmm?

353
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,870
Mr. Armstrong, sir.

354
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,880
You know the rules, young lady. What
are you... What are you doing in here?

355
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,140
I have Mr. Knowles again
this period, Regents Prep.

356
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,140
I was just wondering
where he was going.

357
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:17,010
Um, Mr. Knowles is taking
an administrative leave, okay?

358
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,930
Just go back to your class
until I can find you a sub.

359
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,410
Leave? For what?
That's not fair.

360
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,280
Excuse me, please.

361
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,110
You want to
step outside, please?

362
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:30,850
[students chattering]

363
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,730
What is this?

364
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,340
There was no place
to have class.

365
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,560
You were the one who said,
"Take them anywhere."

366
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,870
- Uh...
- I heard you say that, Mr. Armstrong.

367
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,740
That's right.

368
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,920
This is none of your concern,
okay? Go to class.

369
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,530
STEPHANIE: We're supposed to
study in a room that's freezing,

370
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,920
and now you want to fire
one of the few decent teachers

371
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,270
still willing to work here?
How does that not concern me?

372
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,320
Look, um, Miss, uh...

373
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:05,720
Go back to your class,
all right? All of you.

374
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,330
Come on, go to class.

375
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,020
[all exclaiming in displeasure]

376
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,500
Not until you bring
Mr. Knowles back.

377
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,290
GIRL: We want Mr. Knowles.

378
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,120
Yeah. Where is Mr. Knowles,
and what did you do?

379
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,600
We want Knowles!

380
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:23,820
ALL [chanting]: We want Knowles!

381
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:24,860
Get security.

382
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,560
And hurry.

383
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,130
Get security up here right away.

384
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,390
LESTER: That's not necessary.

385
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,830
Look, all she wants
is our teacher back.

386
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,610
I don't need your help, Lester.

387
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,090
You get down from there.
You're suspended.

388
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,790
What?

389
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,010
You and you, the both of you.

390
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,310
- Come on, man. Let's get out of here.
- Nah, man.

391
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,920
Get back to class right now!

392
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,270
No.

393
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,580
No?

394
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:47,410
Okay. So the two of you
don't want to leave?

395
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,760
I'll tell you what.
Have a seat right over there

396
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:52,500
until I contact your parents.
You're both suspended.

397
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,810
- What?
- Suspended for what?

398
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,900
Mr. Armstrong,
they didn't mean nothing.

399
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,330
We were just freezing
in Mr. Knowles' class.

400
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,070
Why don't you understand that?

401
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,120
Oh, well, all right. Then
you can join the two of them.

402
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,470
Me?

403
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,730

ARMSTRONG:
You come back here, young lady!

406
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,650
Williams!
I know who you are.

407
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,960
BOY: Heads-up, Five-O!

408
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:16,260
ARMSTRONG: Jackson,
where the hell have you been?

409
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,050
Come on, get these kids
out of here. Get him!

410
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,400
Steppin' through.

411
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:20,790
ARMSTRONG:
And take these two.

412
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,490
Put 'em in detention
until I call their parents.

413
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,180
Parents?

414
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,620
- ARMSTRONG: Come on, get out of here.
- No parents.

415
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,100
Look, you don't need to call
nobody's parents or nothin'.

416
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:31,540
Look, I'm going back to class.
No problem, okay?

417
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,240
But you're not, eh, Ziggy?

418
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:36,110
What are you doing, man?
This is bullshit!

419
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,850
ARMSTRONG:
You had your chance.

420
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,900
- LESTER: She's right and you know it.
- ZIGGY: Let go of me!

421
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,460
I don't want no explanation.
Just go.

422
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,590
Let me go!

423
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,810

Get up. Come on,
get on your feet. Let's go.

Oh, my God.

LESTER: Ziggy,
give me the gun.

439
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,600
I can't go home.

440
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,040
Stay back.

441
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,430
I gotta go.
I can't go home.

Give me the gun, man. Come
on, man, just give me my gun back.

You don't understand, okay?

451
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,620
It's okay.

LESTER: Look, he can't go home,
Officer. Just listen to him, okay?

453
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,500
What, you want to go to jail?

454

- I can't go home!
- JACKSON: You wanna go to jail?

455
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,630
'Cause that's what's
gonna happen to you

456
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,070
unless you put
that gun down now!

What happened?

Call an ambulance.
Get the police here.

474
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,980
Tell 'em it's one of theirs.
Maybe they'll hurry.

475
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,640
- What happened?
- This little kid here shot me in my leg.

476
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,810
It was an accident. He
didn't mean to shoot you.

477
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,200
- It's not an accident.
- He was trying to leave and you wouldn't let him go.

478
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,770
He was trying to leave.
His back was to him.

You take your hands
off of him, okay?

Come on, behind me, money.
Come on, Ziggy.

Put the gun down!

No, wait, Rivers!
No, don't leave, man.

I need you.
You saw what happened.

Man, we gotta get out of here.

505

No. Armstrong, I want you
out of the school now, okay?

506
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:55,400
No! I want you and every cop
in the school out now!

507
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:56,660
Have you lost your mind?

You!

Go.

I hope you know
what you're doing, son.

00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,290
You're just like the rest of us.

871
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:24,250
The fact of the matter is that there
are 2,500 students in my school.

872
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,650
Most of them are fine
young men and women.

873
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,950
The kids in there belong in
jail, not in school. That's it.

874
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,040
You belong in jail.

875
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:32,870
WOMAN [on TV]:
What about the kids?

876
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,920
Often by the time children
like these get to high school,

877
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,350
it's too late.

878
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,310
Boo! Get the fuck
out of here, man.

879
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,700
Boo!

880
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,440
...to violence.

881
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:44,230
The value of education,
the notion of good or evil.

882
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,890
Many of these kids are little
more than human predators,

883
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:52,060
Unburdened by the social and
moral constraints we take for granted.

884
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,200
You want to play like gangsters?

885
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:56,070
Now you are gangsters.

886
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,810
ANCHOR 3:16-year veteran of
the force, Officer Dante Jackson

887
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,330
made headlines recently
as one of the principals

888
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,120
in the Brooklyn
National Bank shootout

889
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,950
in which four people
were killed.

890
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,120
The decorated officer
was assigned

891
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:09,080
to the high school in a continuing
effort to stem school violence.

892
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:11,740
Say, word, man.
You a hero?

893
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,350
Now, what in the world would you
have to do to get busted down here, huh?

894
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,910
[telephone ringing]

895
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,140
Yo.

896
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:30,280
AUDREY [over phone]:
This is Audrey McDonald

897
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,580
with the New York City
Police Department.

898
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,540
Who am I speaking to?

899
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,500
[whispers]
who is it?

900
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,150
- AUDREY: Hello?
- Lester.

901
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:39,810
Lester.

902
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,160
How you doing, Lester?

903
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,550
Everybody all right in there?
You all right?

904
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,810
Yeah, everybody's fine

905
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,070
as long as you don't try
to come in here.

906
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,030
[whispers]
Check the hall.

907
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:50,300
AUDREY: No one's gonna do that.

908
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,690
Everything's gonna be all right
now that I'm here.

909
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,170
How's Officer Jackson doing?

910
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,430
Sounds like he might need
some medical attention.

911
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,390
Pfft. Well, he shot himself
in the leg, that's all.

912
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,650
- Bullshit! Give me the goddamn pho...
- [shushing]

913
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,620
AUDREY: I would like to hear
the officer say he's all right.

914
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:06,790
Is that possible?

915
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,400
Well, anything's
possible, Audrey,

916
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:09,530
but, uh, maybe we can speak

917
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,140
to some of the people
on television

918
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,710
who have been calling us
thugs and criminals first.

919
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,930
Is that possible?

920
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,580
I can't control
the media, Lester.

921
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:23,810
Can I please speak
to Officer Jackson?

922
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,500
No. It ain't
happenin'.

923
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,460
Why?

924
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:33,430
Because I'm making
the rules. That's why.

925
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,470
[exhilarating music playing]

926
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,700
OFFICER [over radio]:
Team One in position.

927
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,090
West stairway.

928
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,270
Gate is locked
and blocked with debris.

929
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,270
Advance?

930
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:57,890
Negative.
Hold your positions.

931
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:03,370
Lester, I don't know
who's right or wrong.

932
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,670
I don't care.

933
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,420
But the sooner we resolve this,

934
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,900
the better your chances are.

935
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:11,250
My chances? I know exactly
what my chances are.

936
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,510
I watch TV.

937
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,510
I know the drill.

938
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,340
Lester, at least let me
send in a doctor.

939
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,380
How about that, Lester?

940
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,600
A doctor?

941
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:23,740
No! No doctor.

942
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,780
Doctor'll be a cop.
He'll be armed.

943
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:30,790
How am I doing?

944
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,270
LESTER: No doctors.

945
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:34,310
AUDREY: All right,
okay, no doctor.

946
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,620
You're in there,
and we're out here.

947
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,190
Tell me what you want
so we can end this.

948
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,670
Want from the cops?

949
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,280
- Lester, give me the phone.
- ZIGGY: I'm starvin'.

950
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:44,980
How about 50 pizzas
from Pizza Hut?

951
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,190
Extra, extra large.

952
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,800
Martini, shaken
and not stirred...

953
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,240
Ask 'em for life insurance,
Lester. We're fucked.

954
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:51,240
Lester, don't listen to them.

955
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:52,370
Give me the phone.

956
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,120
LYNN: Come on, Lester.

957
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,590
Lap dance from Cameron Diaz!

958
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,160
LESTER: All right,
knock it off.

959
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,990
- LESTER: Look, what do we really want?
- Jesus Christ.

960
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,040
- STEPHANIE: Lester, let me talk to them.
- Bob Marley's Greatest Hits.

961
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,210
Oh, I know, how about tickets
to Hole?

962
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,340
[indistinct chatter]

963
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:06,430
STEPHANIE: Come on, Lester,
give me the phone.

964
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,610
RODNEY: Yo, they're not
giving you anything!

965
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,740
I took a shot in my leg,

966
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,090
and this is what
you guys are asking for?

967
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,130
There's a whole precinct
of people outside

968
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,660
just waitin' for you
to say somethin'.

969
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:15,140
- Say somethin'!
- Shut up, okay?

970
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:20,010
Okay, Audrey.

971
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,490
Okay, you know what I want?

972
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,190
You know what I want
the cops to get me?

973
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,800
My dad.

974
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:26,970
Now deal with that.

975
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:32,110
Lester? Lester?

976
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,810
[sighs] I need to talk
to Dewitt's father.

977
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:36,900
INTEL OFFICER:
Only if you can channel.

978
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,720
He was shot and killed
three months ago.

979
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,510
It gets worse.

980
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,690
NYPD shot him.

981
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,470
The family filed a wrongful
death against the department.

982
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,650
He wasn't armed.

983
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,000
Jesus.

984
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,780
[sullen music playing]

985
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:02,920
STEPHANIE: Lester...

986
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,620
Look, I know about your dad.

987
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:07,840
I don't want to talk about it.

988
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,580
Okay?

989
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,240
Look out there.

990
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:22,810
You say you're tired
of people not listening to you.

991
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,770
Well, everybody's listening.

992
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:33,130
What do you have to say?

993
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,050
I know you out there,
motherfuckers.

994
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:42,570
You can't fool me.

995
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:45,840
I'm minister of defense,
motherfuckers.

996
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:50,670
Y'all want to play?

997
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,840
[rattling]

998
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:56,540
Yeah, I hear you, motherfuckers!

999
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:58,070
I know you hear me!

1000
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,720
Come on. Come halfway
up those stairs.

1001
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:01,850
Jackson's gonna be toast

1002
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,110
before you make it
to the library.

1003
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,380
AUDREY: I thought you said

1004
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:07,510
these weren't typical
Lincoln students.

1005
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:10,820
Well, they shot a cop.

1006
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,780
I'd say that's not typical.

1007
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:15,390
Stephanie Williams,
National Dean's List.

1008
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,560
Lester Dewitt,
point guard, 3.5 GPA.

1009
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:20,740
Assistant manager
at Foot Locker?

1010
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:23,000
Rivers Tremont,
science and tech magnet.

1011
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:25,660
Handful of misdemeanors.

1012
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:27,400
They were pretty upset
about something this morning

1013
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:29,790
when they came
to your office, huh?

1014
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,450
Now, what exactly happened
in there, Mr. Armstrong?

1015
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:37,230
My son Lester
has never been arrested.

1016
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:38,800
He is no criminal.

1017
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:40,720
Now, what he's doing
is flat-out wrong.

1018
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:42,240
I know that.

1019
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:45,590
But you have to understand
that this boy, Lester,

1020
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,460
sat in a police station
for two days,

1021
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:49,860
and no one,

1022
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:52,340
no one would speak to him
about his father's death.

1023
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:54,950
REPORTER [on TV]: No demands
have been specifically requested...

1024
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:57,520
Fuck them silly-ass demands.

1025
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:02,090
What we really want is respect.

1026
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:04,350
Respect comes at the end
of a nine with a fresh clip.

1027
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,220
Yo, Les, give Rodney here
the phone

1028
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:10,010
so he can reinforce
those stereotypes

1029
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,530
- before it's too late.
- [Lynn laughing]

1030
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,010
Don't get it twisted, Rivers.

1031
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,320
Just 'cause we in
this bitch together

1032
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:20,150
don't mean we friends.
So don't play me.

1033
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:24,590
No. I'm not playin' ya.

1034
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,410
You're playin' with yourself.

1035
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,200
You're about to go blind.

1036
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:29,500
So much for your respect.

1037
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,640
Fuck you!

1038
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,770
RIVERS: Fuck, man!
Get off of me!

1039
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,420
Get off of me, you bitch!

1040
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:38,820
LYNN: Stop it!
Get off him!

1041
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:40,210
Get the fuck off me, bitch!

1042
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,650
- What the hell's your problem?
- Get off him!

1043
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:43,820

00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:28,420
I can't negotiate anything
if you don't...

1218
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,640
You better find
that teacher, Detective,

1219
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:31,510
Or my men will get Jackson out.

1220
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:33,900
[sighs]

1221
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:35,080
Where's this guy, Knowles?

1222
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,130
- Hey.
- Jesus.

1223
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:49,220
I mean, could I get some
fucking privacy around here?

1224
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:51,610
No.

1225
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:56,750
[sighs] What did I
ever do to you?

1226
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,360
Listen, princess, I'm tired
of smart and pretty girls

1227
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:01,190
always looking down
on slags like me.

1228
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,320
When have I ever?

1229
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:04,670
You know what? The only reason
you know I'm alive is because I diss you.

1230
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:13,850
I'm sorry.

1231
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,510
[captivating instrumental

1232
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:18,250
So, fat and sick, huh?

1233
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,780
I just wanted him to kiss me.

1234
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,040
I never even got the kiss.

1235
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:29,520
- [sniffles]
- What are you gonna do?

1236
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:31,570
I don't know.

1237
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:38,840
It's just been, like,
the most fucked up day.

1238
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:44,930
I'm really scared.

1239
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:46,930
Shit, you're scared?
[chuckles]

1240
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,540
No. It's different for you.

1241
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:50,150
You've got, like,
this confidence,

1242
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,590
this whole thing like, uh,
above it all, you know.

1243
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,110
I know how to put on
a good show sometimes,

1244
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,640
but I definitely hear
what people have to say...

1245
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:58,680
But, Stephanie, you don't care,
so it doesn't matter.

1246
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:01,290
Everybody cares, Lynn.

1247
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:09,300
Hey, you know, um...

1248
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:12,390
If I would have known this whole
takeover thing was gonna happen,

1249
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:15,790
I never would have fucked him.

1250
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:18,880
[both laugh]

1251
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,700
RIVERS:
Minister of defense, huh?

1252
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:23,750
That's some funny shit.

1253
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,530
Whatever it is
you've been smoking,

1254
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:26,840
I got something better.

1255
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:28,930
Tch. Let me tell you
something, man.

1256
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:30,190
A nigga like me

1257
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,930
is just a chalk mark
waiting to happen.

1258
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,890
What the fuck you doing here?

1259
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,070
On the real, don't give me
that movie-of-the-week bullshit.

1260
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:41,510
Like, you think you got some
kind of monopoly on oppression?

1261
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,820
Shit.
I'm the trailer park prince.

1262
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:47,300
RODNEY: And?

1263
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:49,820
You still ain't tell me
what you're doing here.

1264
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:51,040
RIVERS: You know, my pops
used to always brag

1265
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:54,000
about how his generation
gave a shit

1266
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:56,220
and how we don't care
about nothin'.

1267
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:59,220
You know, in the '60s,
they had Vietnam to fight over.

1268
00:54:59,350 --> 00:55:01,740
They had voting rights. They had
all kinds of shit. Well, you know what?

1269
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,440
Now I got my own little
war story to tell.

1270
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:10,270
And you know something?

1271
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:15,980
This might give my little
bullshit life some meaning.

1272
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:22,460
You feel me?

1273
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:29,730
Yeah, I feel you.

1274
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,300
I feel you.

1275

[exhilarating music playing]

1276
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:43,610
These people are crazy.

1277
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:44,920
These people
are just gangbangers,

1278
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:48,270
pulling out just guns,
gasoline, M16s, TEC-9s.

1279
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,750
I don't know where you
get them weaponry from.

1280
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,270
I mean, it's like Iraq,
you know what I mean?

1281
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:11,730
Hey, Ziggy?

1282
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:13,860
Ziggy?

1283
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:16,860
Um...

1284
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:20,910
Take a look at your book?

1285
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:25,090
Um, I'm not finished.

1286
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:28,090
That's all right.
I just want to see.

1287
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,530
Come on, Michelangelo.

1288
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:32,970
[chuckling] Come on.

1289
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,840
You can give me a little peek,
a little preview.

1290
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,110
You know about Michelangelo?

1291
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,060
A little bit.

1292
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:46,680
[captivating music playing]

1293
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:53,120
I think that Sistine
Chapel stuff is pretty cool.

1294
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,810
- Hmm.
- You know, God's finger reaching down

1295
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:56,860
to touch his creature.

1296
00:56:57,690 --> 00:56:58,560
[chuckles]

1297
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:01,170
Uh, can I...

1298
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:03,300
Can I...
Can I look at it?

1299
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:05,820
Yeah.

1300
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:09,090
My favorite.

1301
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:13,270
You know, if I could be one
painter, I'd like to be Basquiat.

1302
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:14,790
They call him
"The Radiant Child"

1303
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,050
because he died so young.

1304
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,360
I mean, the both of them,

1305
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:20,800
what they do with paint...

1306
00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:23,930
will last forever.

1307
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:25,980
My son used to draw.

1308
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,890
Daryl, he was a tagger.

1309
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:31,760
He'd use spray paints and...

1310
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:34,420
Whatever.

1311
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:35,290
ZIGGY: Yeah?

1312
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:37,550
What was his tag sign?

1313
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,080
I don't know.

1314
00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:42,690
You never saw it?
You never asked him?

1315
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:44,560
I didn't want to know.

1316
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:46,690
He was breaking the law.

1317
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:50,040
You should've.

1318
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:53,830
Yeah, maybe.

1319
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,050
We get out of this,

1320
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:01,490
I'm gonna make sure that...

1321
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:04,800
I put whoever hurt you...

1322
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,800
in a place where they can't
never touch you again.

1323
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,070
LESTER: Yo, Ziggy,
get away from him.

1324
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,020
Is this your son?

1325
00:58:15,550 --> 00:58:16,500
Where'd you get that?

1326
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:22,290
You take him to Knicks games?

1327
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:23,380
Help him with his homework?

1328
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:24,430
Teach him to jab?

1329
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:25,860
Give it back.

1330
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:27,650
It's not yours.

1331
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:32,910
Give it to me!

1332
00:58:34,130 --> 00:58:35,040
LESTER:
Must be real sweet.

1333
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:37,000
You know, Jackson...

1334
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:41,920
I bet he's out there right now.

1335
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:45,660
He's worried about
his dad, the, uh, the hero.

1336
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:48,190
No, son, I haven't seen
my kid in over a year.

1337
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,540
What'd you do, Jackson, huh?

1338
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:52,630
You jump all over him?
Did you beat him up, too?

1339
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:57,240
That's why
they sent you down here.

1340
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:00,850
I'm on leave.

1341
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,290
LESTER:
What kind of leave?

1342
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:08,210
Disability leave.

1343
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:10,250
Disability.

1344
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:12,300
What gets a cop
on disability leave?

1345
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:14,080
Stress.

1346
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:15,910
[scoffs] Man.

1347
00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:19,440
What do you know about stress?

1348
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:21,400
My wife...

1349
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:24,920
and my son...

1350
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:27,580
What, they're dead?

1351
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:30,450
No.

1352
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:32,880
They're lost.

1353
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:37,930
Lost to me, anyway.

1354
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:40,240
You know what that
feels like, right?

1355
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:42,500
When you lose someone,

1356
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:44,850
and you can't afford
to lose them.

1357
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,550
When your heart breaks.

1358
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,160
When you get a parasite
in your guts.

1359
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:53,510
Makes you...

1360
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:57,650
do something mean
or do something stupid.

1361
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:01,830
That's what
this is all about, right?

1362
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,000
Right, Lester?

1363
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:05,220
This is about your dad.

You're wrong.

- No.

what you lost.

01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:12,810
ALL [chanting]:
Lincoln Six!

1392
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:24,520
- What?
- CROWD [chanting]: Lincoln Six!

1393
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:30,440
Man, we heard bullets.

1394
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:31,660
I pushed the girl
out of the way,

1395
01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:32,920
'cause I don't want her
to get shot.

1396
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,700
But one of the bullets
hit me in the ankle.

1397
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:35,790
I'm just limping.

1398
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:37,050
One in my culo, too,

1399
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:38,840
but, man, you know,
I can't let that feel me.

1400
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,800
Wait, wait, wait!

1401
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:42,880
REPORTER [on TV]: The crisis
continues at Lincoln High tonight

1402
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:44,540
as negotiators fail
to make any headway

1403
01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:47,110
in their day-long standoff

1404
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:49,060
with what is now believed
to be six students.

1405
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,280
Police have been
held at bay by the group

1406
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:53,330
holding Officer Dante Jackson...

1407
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:54,200
LYNN: Come on!

1408
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:56,640
We want Knowles back!

1409
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,730
- [screams] Yeah!
- CROWD: Yeah!

1410
01:01:58,860 --> 01:01:59,680
[all cheering]

1411
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:01,730
Whoo!

1412
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:05,210
Lincoln Six!

1413
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:06,650
Lincoln Six, baby!

1414
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:08,910
OFFICER: Stay behind
the barricade!

1415
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:10,560
[sirens wailing]

1416
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:13,040
You're runnin' out of
options. Look out there.

1417
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:14,260
All it's gonna take
is somebody throwing

1418
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:16,180
a brick through a window
or firing a shot.

1419
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:18,570
We got half a dozen companies
willing to repair the windows.

1420
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:20,490
We got textbook
companies and roofers.

1421
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:21,920
Let's give them something.

1422
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:23,840
- INTEL OFFICER: He's here.
- They shot a cop.

1423
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:25,580
I got here as fast as I could.

1424
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:27,060
[all whooping]

1425
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:28,670
Yeah!

1426
01:02:30,890 --> 01:02:32,110
RIVERS: Whoo!

1427
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:34,020
LESTER: Man,
you fuckin' crazy.

1428
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:35,630
Hey, yo, you see what happens
when you bring a gun to school?

1429
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:39,850
It's a long way
from the fifth grade

1430
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:41,600
when I pulled that chair
out from under you, huh?

1431
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:44,030
No doubt. [Chuckles]

1432
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,250
You never know.
We might still be able

1433
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:50,130
to make the Lauryn Hill
concert, Steph.

1434
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:54,700
But you wouldn't go
with me anyway, would you?

1435
01:02:56,650 --> 01:02:57,480
No.

1436
01:02:59,000 --> 01:02:59,830
Not a chance.

1437
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:01,530
Damn, girl.

1438
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:05,100
You're tough.

1439
01:03:05,230 --> 01:03:06,880
- LYNN: Oh, Stephanie, Oh, my God.
- [Rodney exclaims in disgust]

1440
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:09,100
[Lynn laughing]

1441
01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:10,750
- LYNN: I'm sorry.
- STEPHANIE: Oh, my God.

1442
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:12,100
- LYNN: I don't mean to laugh.
- STEPHANIE: Look at my hair.

1443
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:15,890
Looks like Jennifer Lopez
had a bad hair day.

1444
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:17,110
Nah, you look good.

1445
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,810
[Rivers laughing]

1446
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:19,980
Yeah, kiss my ass, Rivers.

1447
01:03:20,110 --> 01:03:21,500
You gotta grow one first.

1448
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:22,940
[all laugh]

1449
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:24,770
RIVERS: Yeah, right.

1450
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:27,990
Tch. Lost my ghetto card
with that.

1451
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,430
RIVERS: Hey, I didn't
know you were bald.

1452
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,380
Oh, as salaamu alaikum, brother.

1453
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:33,260
Whoo!

1454
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:34,260
Yes, it's true. I still love
the Lakers, my brother.

1455
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:41,740
Yo, I seen this face on a
milk carton or something.

1456
01:03:41,870 --> 01:03:43,090
- Snap.
- RODNEY: Aw, man.

1457
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:44,270
What's wrong with your eyes?

1458
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,920
I know, I know.
Aw, it's so embarrassing.

1459
01:03:47,050 --> 01:03:48,620
[all laughing]

1460
01:03:49,490 --> 01:03:50,930
LESTER: Oh! [Laughs]

1461
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,580
Where you hidin'
the merchandise, Rivers?

1462
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:53,970
You don't want to know.

1463
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:54,800
Probably got a doobie
in your right pocket.

1464
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:55,840
Yes. Always.

1465
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:59,890
Hello, my name's Lester.

1466
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:02,070
I like long, quiet
walks on the beach.

1467
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,850
RIVERS: I'm a Sagittarius.

1468
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:08,510
- I like to wear triple X large magnum condoms.
- Hey, I do.

1469
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:09,730
- RIVERS: Oh, really?
- LYNN: Yeah, right.

1470
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:11,820
[laughs] In your dreams, Les.

1471
01:04:11,950 --> 01:04:13,510
Sure, virgin boy.

1472
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,040
[telephone ringing]

1473
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:26,220
I gotta, um...
I gotta use the head.

1474
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,620
Yeah, man, give me the gat.

1475
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:30,360
Cop has to take a leak.

1476
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:32,360
Look, look, man, just
take him to the bathroom.

1477
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:33,750
Don't even worry about it, man.

1478
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,580
Just give me the gun,
I'll take him myself.

1479
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:37,100
Look, go ahead and take him,
man. I'm not giving you the gun, okay?

1480
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:38,410
What's the problem, yo?

1481
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:39,760
Just give me the gun.
I'll be right back.

1482
01:04:39,890 --> 01:04:40,670
Go ahead. I'm not giving you
the gun, all right?

1483
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:42,240
[sighs]

1484
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:46,370
All right, whatever.

1485
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:48,770
All right, come on, let's go.

1486
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,420
Well, Audrey,

1487
01:04:52,550 --> 01:04:54,340
you see the crowd out there?

1488
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:55,560
Hey, Lester, it's Knowles.

1489
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:57,250
Mr. Knowles?

1490
01:04:57,380 --> 01:04:59,250
What's going on, man?

1491
01:04:59,390 --> 01:05:00,860
I'm doing what I...

1492
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,950
I'm doing what
I had to do, Knowles.

1493
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:05,390
Is everybody okay?

1494
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:07,570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1495
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:09,090
Everybody's fine, man,
even the cop.

1496
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,350
They're listening, right?

1497
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:13,400
Of course they are.

1498
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:17,010
I hope you're not
doing this for me, man.

1499
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:19,840
You have to work
the system, not jack it.

1500
01:05:19,970 --> 01:05:21,150
RODNEY: Man,
get in there, man!

1501
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,580
I ain't no bitch like Lester.

1502
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:24,580
I'll bust a cap
in your ass right now.

1503
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:25,720
That's why they don't
trust you with a gun.

1504
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:27,330
I don't even trust myself, man.

1505
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:29,590
Get in there, man.

1506
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:31,900
I cannot do it like this.

1507
01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:33,980
I need you to...
You gotta do it for me.

1508
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:36,030
What? I ain't
with that homo shit.

1509
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,640
- Get in there!
- Give me one of my hands, then.

1510
01:05:39,290 --> 01:05:40,510
I should let you
piss on yourself.

1511
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,000
Hurry up, man!

Over here!
[grunts] Hey!

1520
01:06:02,190 --> 01:06:04,410
Everything they're saying

Somebody talk to me.
Give me a...

What's going on

Let's go!

1550

Who fired?

1551
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:02,160
I want to know who fired!

01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,060
RODNEY: Get him up!
Come on!

1563
01:07:28,190 --> 01:07:30,270
Get him up!
Get his ass up there.

1564
01:07:30,410 --> 01:07:31,580
- Come on!
- RIVERS: Shit!

1565
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:32,540
RODNEY: They're comin'!
They're comin'!

1566
01:07:32,670 --> 01:07:34,060
Fuck, man!

1567
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:35,760
RIVERS:
Push his fat ass upstairs!

1568
01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:36,980
They're comin'!
They're comin'! Get up!

1569
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:42,200
- RODNEY: Move!
- LESTER: Where we goin'?

1570
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:49,290
LESTER: Ziggy,
where we goin', man?

1571
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:50,430
This is a fuckin' dead end!

1572
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:51,770
STEPHANIE:
Great. Now what?

1573
01:07:51,910 --> 01:07:52,690
Where we goin', man?

1574
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:54,780
To my place.

1575
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:02,000
[whispers] Hurry. They'll
never find us in here.

1576
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,090
[shushing]

1577
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:05,830
[grunting, groaning]

1578
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:07,220
RIVERS:
They're right below us.

1579
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:08,310
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you, man!

1580
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:09,880
ZIGGY: Be quiet, man.

1581
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:11,620
Hey.

1582
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:13,010
- [muffled shouts]
- [shushing]

1583
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:14,320
Be quiet.

1584
01:08:14,450 --> 01:08:15,840
OFFICER: Pete,
anything? Any visual?

1585
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,110
Let's go! Let's go!

1586
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:23,240
You all right?

1587
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:24,460
Yeah, I'm okay.

1588
01:08:24,590 --> 01:08:26,980
[indistinct chatter
in the distance]

1589
01:08:27,070 --> 01:08:28,070
Look,

1590
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:30,860
they gotta know we still got him

1591
01:08:30,990 --> 01:08:32,900
And that he's all right.

1592
01:08:33,030 --> 01:08:34,340
Without letting them
know where we are?

1593
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:35,300
How the hell we gonna do that?

1594
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:36,950
Stop it, Rodney.

1595
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:39,470
- Fuckin' stop it already.
- All right, quiet.

1596
01:08:39,610 --> 01:08:41,170
ZIGGY: Hey! [Shushes]
They're gonna hear us.

1597
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:44,130
Hey, Les.

1598
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:46,310
[phone beeps]

1599
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:48,570
Didn't want you to use all my
free minutes till it was worth it.

1600
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:52,710
- Where's Jackson?
- OFFICER [over radio]: We lost him.

1601
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:55,400
Hallways, stairways,
classrooms, all clear.

1602
01:08:55,530 --> 01:08:57,140
Do you have a 20?

1603
01:08:57,270 --> 01:08:58,490
OFFICER 1: Got nothing
in the stairwell.

1604
01:08:58,620 --> 01:08:59,360
OFFICER 2: All clear.

1605
01:08:59,490 --> 01:09:00,500
OFFICER 3: Nothing, sir.

1606
01:09:00,630 --> 01:09:01,450
OFFICER 4:
Hallway's clear, sir.

1607
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:02,720
OFFICER 5:
They're gone, sir.

1608
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,670
What do you mean, gone?
Sweep it clean.

1609
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:05,540
OFFICER [over radio]:
Copy.

1610
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:06,850
MAN: We've got
a relay from 911.

1611
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:08,720
It's them.

1612
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:09,680
You wanna kill us, Audrey?

1613
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:11,250
That it?
That's your plan?

1614
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:13,730
That's the last thing
I want to have happen.

1615
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:15,120
Is everyone all right?

1616
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:16,290
What do you care?

1617
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:17,250
The officer
shouldn't have fired.

1618
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:18,510
It was an accident.

1619
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:19,860
LESTER: An accident?

1620
01:09:19,950 --> 01:09:21,820
It's always an accident
with you people.

1621
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:23,560
You give us...
you give us something, okay?

1622
01:09:23,650 --> 01:09:24,910
You give us one of our demands.

1623
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:27,870
Or Jackson will be an accident.

1624
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,480
You hear me?
Do you hear me?

1625
01:09:30,610 --> 01:09:32,310
- Yes, I do.
- One thing, Audrey.

1626
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:33,750
Just one thing!

1627
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:40,490
STEPHANIE [over phone]: Audrey,
what about our demands?

1628
01:09:40,620 --> 01:09:42,020
Who... Who is this?
Stephanie?

1629
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:43,540
Is this you, Stephanie?

1630
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:44,500
Yes.

1631
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:46,150
Give us something.

1632
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:49,020
Now, listen, I want you
to get what you want.

1633
01:09:49,150 --> 01:09:51,020
I want you all
to get what you want.

1634
01:09:51,150 --> 01:09:53,850
It's all bullshit,
isn't, Audrey?

1635
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:56,120
AUDREY: Now, Stephanie,
listen to me.

1636
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:59,160
If Lester does anything foolish,

1637
01:09:59,290 --> 01:10:01,770
if anything happens
to Officer Jackson,

1638
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,250
it's murder.

1639
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:06,300
That means
the rest of your life.

1640
01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:07,520
That's not bullshit.

1641
01:10:07,650 --> 01:10:08,690
Give us what we asked for.

1642
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:12,050
[dial tone]

1643
01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:13,000
I lost her.

1644
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:15,530
I understand.
Yes, sir. Right.

1645
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:16,610
The crowd's a problem,

1646
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:17,750
but we're trying
to control them.

1647
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:19,840
Yes.

1648
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:21,750
- Thank you, sir.
- We have the cell number.

1649
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:24,490
It's over.

1650
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:26,190
I want both teams to keep
sweeping the building.

1651
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:29,020
We'll move in at 0500.

1652
01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:30,590
You don't even know
where they are.

1653
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:32,500
MONROE:
We'll find them.

1654
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:34,280
AUDREY: That's less
than an hour.

1655
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:36,070
Commissioner wants this over
before the morning news,

1656
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,900
so, uh, we'll take it from here.

1657
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:41,600
You've been relieved, Detective.

1658
01:10:41,730 --> 01:10:42,900
- What?
- You heard me.

1659
01:10:45,730 --> 01:10:46,820
We can give them something.

1660
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,650
Negotiations are over.

1661
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:52,690
Hey, if this were Westchester,
you'd wait for the millennium.

1662
01:10:52,830 --> 01:10:54,040
Yeah, well, this isn't
Westchester, Mr. Knowles.

1663
01:10:54,170 --> 01:10:56,610
Okay, look,
just give me the phone.

1664
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:58,660
Let me try him
one more time, please.

1665
01:10:58,790 --> 01:10:59,750
Thanks for your help,
Mr. Knowles.

1666
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:01,050
What?

1667
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:02,840
Goodbye, Mr. Knowles.

1668
01:11:02,970 --> 01:11:04,450
[beeping]

1669
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:15,890
Didn't have to go this way.

1670
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:18,500
Yeah, well, it did.

1671
01:11:24,290 --> 01:11:26,820
[enchanting music playing]

1672
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:17,910
That shit is ill.

1673
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:21,090
That's beautiful.

1674
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:36,360
RIVERS: Damn.

1675
01:12:38,190 --> 01:12:40,850
Hey, yo, little man,
you live here, man?

1676
01:12:40,930 --> 01:12:43,150
Yeah. I thought
it'd be safe here.

1677
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,500
It's still safe.

1678
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:47,070
Nah, man.

1679
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,160
They gotta make examples
out of us now.

1680
01:12:50,330 --> 01:12:51,600
They gonna come in here
and smoke all of us.

1681
01:12:51,730 --> 01:12:52,810
God damn it, Rodney.

1682
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:53,820
But they don't know
where we are.

1683
01:12:53,950 --> 01:12:57,340
Yeah, for how long,
huh? Huh?

1684
01:12:57,470 --> 01:12:58,860
They shoot first,
ask questions later...

1685
01:12:58,990 --> 01:13:00,390
Look, stop it, Rodney.

1686
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:01,480
That's enough, all right?

1687
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:05,870
- Lester...
- No, Stephanie. It's simple.

1688
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:08,220
You heard what I said
on the phone.

1689
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:10,440
Anybody want to leave,
there's the door.

1690
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:20,890
[siren wailing]

1691
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:30,630
RIVERS: And proud dad is...

1692
01:13:32,550 --> 01:13:35,250
Not so proud. [Laughs]

1693
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:36,250
That's too bad.

1694
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:37,470
Yeah.

1695
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,910
I mean, not that
you're havin' a kid.

1696
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,860
There's lots of famous
people that come from...

1697
01:13:41,990 --> 01:13:43,470
Dumb sluts who get knocked up.

1698
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:46,480
You're not dumb.

1699
01:13:53,310 --> 01:13:54,090
What are you gonna do?

1700
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:58,270
I was kind of hoping
they'd nuke us

1701
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,010
and I wouldn't have to
worry about it anymore.

1702
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:09,670
You think we should give up?

1703
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:13,980
Not yet.

1704
01:14:17,070 --> 01:14:19,420
- RODNEY: Hey, what's up?
- Get your hands off me.

1705
01:14:19,550 --> 01:14:23,040
Yo, I say we take
his ass to the roof,

1706
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,600
they don't give us
what we want right now,

1707
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:26,780
motherfucker gonna fly.

1708
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:29,170
- Not now, all right?
- No, now's the time, man.

1709
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:30,910
Look, I know it's not
going to be easy,

1710
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:33,310
but think about
your father, man.

1711
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:34,480
He ain't take shit
from the cops.

1712
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:35,440
Shut up, all right, Rodney?

1713
01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:38,960
You can't let them
get away with that.

1714
01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:39,970
Know what I'm saying?

1715
01:14:41,230 --> 01:14:42,710
It's payback time.

1716
01:14:43,710 --> 01:14:45,580
And if you bitch up
after all of this,

1717
01:14:45,710 --> 01:14:46,620
then you ain't shit.

1718
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,980
Pssh. Good thing he ain't livin'
to see his son bendin' over...

1719
01:14:54,110 --> 01:14:55,070
Shut the fuck up.

1720
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:00,200
No, that's all right.

1721
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:03,990
Shoot me.

1722
01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:06,770
Yeah, shoot it, man.

1723
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:08,820
Don't push me,
all right, Rodney?

1724
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:10,000
Yeah, 'cause you're feelin' me.

1725
01:15:11,950 --> 01:15:13,000
I know you feelin' me.

1726
01:15:19,570 --> 01:15:21,660
Time to start pointing that
thing in the right direction.

1727
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:25,360
Ride or die.

1728

OFFICER 1: We're moving
through the north corridor.

1729
01:15:37,370 --> 01:15:38,630
OFFICER 2: There's only
one floor left, Lieutenant.

[exhilarating music playing]

1731
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:57,170
Nobody gotta die here.

1732
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:02,700
Not him. Not me.

1733
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:07,180
Nobody.

1734
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:11,880
But you,

1735
01:16:12,010 --> 01:16:14,060
you're the only thing that's keeping
that kid from going over the edge.

1736
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,670
Don't let Rodney's voice be
the last voice he hears, okay?

1737
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,940
MAN [over radio]:
Medevacs are on the way.

1738
01:16:29,030 --> 01:16:31,510
ETA, five minutes.

1739
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:32,950
MONROE:
All units stand by.

1740
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,730
We move in when we
confirm their location.

1741
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:40,820
[helicopter whirring]

1742
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:46,090
Lester, I don't know
how much longer

1743
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:48,700
he's going to make it
without a doctor.

1744
01:16:48,830 --> 01:16:51,140
I'm not willing to let
anyone die in here.

1745
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:52,490
- Are you?
- [sighs]

1746
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:57,890
If we don't get nothin',
what did we do it for?

1747
01:16:58,710 --> 01:17:00,890
I'll let Ziggy down, everybody.

1748
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:02,280
Just like my dad.

1749
01:17:03,890 --> 01:17:06,370
They better give us something.

1750
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:09,900
Look, you stood up and
you hyped up this whole city,

1751
01:17:11,030 --> 01:17:12,380
and we followed you.

1752
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:15,600
Everybody knows who we are now.

1753
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:20,860
Whatever it is that you
have to say about your father,

1754
01:17:20,950 --> 01:17:22,950
they will listen now.

1755
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,300
Fuck they will.

1756
01:17:24,430 --> 01:17:25,220
They will.

1757
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:29,480
Lester, tell me.

1758
01:17:30,610 --> 01:17:31,700
Tell me what happened.

1759
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,580
[cars whizzing by]

1760
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:53,380
We stopped at this
all-night market, right?

1761
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:56,340
We'd just beat Rosemont
by about 20 points.

1762
01:17:57,210 --> 01:17:59,210
My dad was pumped.
So he goes,

1763
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:01,560
"I wanna surprise you,
champ. Wait right here."

1764
01:18:04,690 --> 01:18:05,820
The cops roll up.

1765
01:18:05,950 --> 01:18:08,090
[sirens wailing]

1766
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:11,830
They fly right when he's coming
out with some Haagen-Dazs,

1767
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:15,830
and they say,
"Assume the position!"

1768
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:18,230
"There's a robbery nearby
and you fit the description."

1769
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:22,540
He looks at them,

1770
01:18:23,670 --> 01:18:24,710
and he looks at me,

1771
01:18:25,970 --> 01:18:27,670
and he says, "No."

1772
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,150
They say,
"Assume the position!"

1773
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:30,630
OFFICER:
Assume the position!

1774
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:31,590
And they pull their guns.

1775
01:18:35,370 --> 01:18:36,900
My dad smiles and says,

1776
01:18:37,030 --> 01:18:39,380
"Gentlemen,
I'm not guilty of anything."

1777
01:18:39,470 --> 01:18:40,600
"I've been at a game
with my son."

1778
01:18:40,730 --> 01:18:41,470
Next thing I know...

1779
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:47,340
He was on the ground,
knee in his back,

1780
01:18:47,470 --> 01:18:49,170
face on the concrete.

1781
01:18:50,780 --> 01:18:53,480
I move to get out of the car,

1782
01:18:53,610 --> 01:18:54,740
But the cop says,
"Don't move, boy!"

1783
01:18:56,610 --> 01:18:58,180
I try, I try to get out.

1784
01:18:58,310 --> 01:18:59,830
I'm trying to get out...

1785
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:01,880
They shove me back,

1786
01:19:03,270 --> 01:19:04,140
and I gave up.

1787
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:08,450
I look at my dad.

1788
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:10,240
He starts breathing
all crazy and shit.

1789
01:19:11,670 --> 01:19:13,060
He's reaching for his pocket.

1790
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:16,240
And I know what
he's reaching for.

1791
01:19:18,110 --> 01:19:20,030
The cops, they yell,

1792
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:21,550
- "Gun!"
- [gunshot]

1793
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:24,510
- "Gun!"
- [gunshots]

1794
01:19:35,390 --> 01:19:36,390
And they shot him.

1795
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:38,130
[indistinct
police radio chatter]

1796
01:19:39,390 --> 01:19:40,350
They shot him.

1797
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:50,360
[helicopter whirring]

1798
01:19:54,370 --> 01:19:55,540
He had asthma, Stephanie.

1799
01:19:56,930 --> 01:20:00,070
He was just reaching
for his goddamn inhaler.

1800
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:02,370
I didn't do a thing.

1801
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:04,720
I just sat there...

1802
01:20:05,990 --> 01:20:06,990
and I watched.

1803
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,950
The cops said
it was an accident.

1804
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:18,350
I can't let him down again.

1805
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:21,040
Lester...

1806
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:41,890
[cell phone rings]

1807
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:48,070
LESTER: What have you
got for us, Audrey?

1808
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:50,730
KNOWLES [over phone]:
Lester, it's me, Knowles.

1809
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:52,510
Knowles? Man, you...

1810
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:54,560
Who else is there?

1811
01:20:54,690 --> 01:20:56,250
Nobody.

1812
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:59,870
I'm outside at a pay phone
freezing my balls off.

1813
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,610
I stole the cell number
from the police.

1814
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:05,220
This criminal shit
must be contagious, man.

1815
01:21:05,350 --> 01:21:08,660
KNOWLES:
Look, Lester, the cops,

1816
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:10,790
they figured out where you are
and they're coming in.

1817
01:21:16,620 --> 01:21:17,450
When?

1818
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:18,360
KNOWLES: Any minute.

1819
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:21,540
LESTER: Not even
one of my demands.

1820
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:25,720
Now, Lester, listen to me.

1821
01:21:25,850 --> 01:21:27,680
If you want to
keep this thing alive,

1822
01:21:27,810 --> 01:21:30,330
then you walk out now.

1823
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:31,680
We'll take this to court.

1824
01:21:31,810 --> 01:21:33,070
I'll stand with you.

1825
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:36,250
A lot of us will. Lester,
you have to end this now.

1826
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:37,510
Do you hear me?

1827
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:39,300
- I hear you.
- Lester,

1828
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:40,860
now just get out of there.

1829
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:43,000
Yo, Knowles...

1830
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:46,520
thanks, man.

1831

[indistinct chatter]

1833
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:57,790
Got 'em, Lieutenant.

1834
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:01,140
Fourth floor.
East stairwell. Copy?

1835
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:03,280
Team two and three,
proceed to east stairwell.

1836
01:22:03,410 --> 01:22:05,020
Then full breach.

1837
01:22:05,150 --> 01:22:06,850
Tell 'em we're on our way out,
okay? Then you get going.

1838
01:22:06,930 --> 01:22:08,670
I don't want you
or anyone to get hurt.

1839
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,810
Us? What about you?

1840

- RIVERS: What you doing, man? We're in this together.
- LESTER: Get up.

1841
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:13,510
- No.
- STEPHANIE: Lester.

1842
01:22:13,590 --> 01:22:14,770
What do you expect me to do?

1843
01:22:14,850 --> 01:22:15,860
- I gave them time.
- Lester, don't do this.

1844
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:17,510
What did we ask for?

1845
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:19,770
Knowles to be rehired
and some fucking books!

1846
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:21,120
- STEPHANIE: No, you're wrong!
- ZIGGY: Don't do this!

1847
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:22,690
They were never gonna
give us anything.

1848
01:22:22,820 --> 01:22:24,560
They lied like they always
fucking do. Now get up!

1849
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:26,300
- Come on, Rodney, help me get him up.
- Get the fuck up!

What are you doing?

1854

LESTER: Go now!
I gave them time!

Everybody, get out of here now!

Listen to me.

1864
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,260
Don't do this, son.

1865

LESTER: No,
you listen to me, okay?

1866
01:23:13,830 --> 01:23:15,390
You know,
when I was little, man,

1867
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:17,570
my dad used to walk me
every day to the school door.

1868
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:20,010
And one day, he gave me
his watch, his dad's watch.

1869
01:23:21,180 --> 01:23:22,400
And you know what he said?

1870
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:23,660
- Do you know what he said?
- [Jackson groaning]

1871
01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:26,970
- What?
- He said, "Be on time."

1872
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:28,280
He said, "Pay attention."

1873
01:23:28,410 --> 01:23:30,150
He said, "Always be a man",

1874
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:31,930
"so you don't end up
being some punk.

One's a hostage,
one's got a gun. Copy?

Look for the clean shot
and take him out.

He didn't raise you
to end up like this, man.

1882
01:23:49,820 --> 01:23:52,210
I didn't want to be.
I didn't have to be.

1883
01:23:53,170 --> 01:23:54,130
But here I am.

1884
01:23:55,390 --> 01:23:56,560
I'm as dead as he is.

1885
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:58,220
Keep moving.

1886
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,870
Shit! He blocked it.

1887
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:02,880
What's he doing?

1888
01:24:04,830 --> 01:24:06,400
Get that helicopter in here.

JACKSON: What?

1893
01:24:19,110 --> 01:24:21,020
I said assume the position.

1894
01:24:24,030 --> 01:24:25,720
- No.
- Look, I'm tired of talking!

1895
01:24:25,850 --> 01:24:28,030
Assume the position!

1896
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:32,120
Your father said no,
now I'm saying no.

1897
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:35,170
I messed up one kid's life, I'm
not about to let you mess up yours.

My father didn't have to die.

No.

1901
01:24:42,650 --> 01:24:44,870
He didn't.

1902
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,920
But you think you can look me
in the eyes and pull that trigger?

1903
01:24:48,570 --> 01:24:50,050
They said, "Case closed."

1904
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:51,920
Fuck them!

1905
01:24:52,970 --> 01:24:55,140
They didn't even say
they were fucking sorry.

1906
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:56,840
He's gone, man.

1907
01:24:58,410 --> 01:25:01,980
He's gone, and I'm sorry.

1908
01:25:02,110 --> 01:25:05,200
I'm sorry you lost your
father. I'm so sorry.

1909
01:25:05,330 --> 01:25:08,240
- It's over.
- But you gotta think about him.

1910
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:11,600
What about that night, remember?

1911
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:13,250
When he...
When he looked at you,

1912
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:17,300
and he watched
his only son playing ball,

1913
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:19,650
and he smiled.

1914
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:21,390
He was so proud of you.

1915
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:26,920
[crying] Check...
Checkout time, slick.

1916
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:28,530
He's looking at you right now.

1917
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:31,050
What do you think he's thinking?

1918
01:25:32,050 --> 01:25:32,790
Huh?

1919
01:25:37,190 --> 01:25:38,230
Be a man.

1921
01:25:41,060 --> 01:25:43,280

- STEPHANIE: Don't shoot, please!
- RIVERS: Don't shoot!

1925
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:55,860
Give me a status report.
Who was shot?

1926
01:25:55,990 --> 01:25:57,690
OFFICER [over radio]:
I can't see anything, sir.

1927
01:25:57,770 --> 01:25:59,470
Do you have a visual
on the subject?

1928
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:00,910
OFFICER: No visual on the
hostage. No visual on the HT.

1929
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,260
Un-fucking-believable!

1930
01:26:02,390 --> 01:26:03,740
Where's the goddamn helicopter?

1931
01:26:09,220 --> 01:26:10,180
It's okay.

1933
01:26:15,620 --> 01:26:16,750
Everything's going
to be all right.

1934

It's okay.

1935
01:26:19,530 --> 01:26:20,800

I should have known
you was gonna bitch up, man!

1941
01:26:31,150 --> 01:26:32,850

New York City Police Department!

1942
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:35,330
Let him go, Rodney!

1943
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:36,900
- JACKSON: Put the gun down!
- LESTER: Damn it, Rodney, it's over!

1944

You ain't got the heart
to do it, I will! Fuck that!

1945

SNIPER: Got a clear
on the HT, sir.

1946
01:26:40,990 --> 01:26:42,560
He's got the gun on Jackson.

1947

Somebody, help!

1959
01:27:34,870 --> 01:27:36,740
Oh, God. Help.

1960
01:27:38,570 --> 01:27:40,480
Somebody, fucking help!

You fight.

1968

My boy, Les.

1969
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:06,160
[sobbing] I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1970
01:28:07,210 --> 01:28:07,990
No.

1971
01:28:10,170 --> 01:28:10,860
For real.

1972
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:15,740
I stood up, man.

1973
01:28:18,870 --> 01:28:20,310
Tell everybody.

1974
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:21,610
No. You're not gonna die.

1975
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:26,180
Promise.

1976

[melancholic music playing]

LESTER:
They're coming, Zig.

1978
01:28:31,270 --> 01:28:32,580
They're coming, Zig.
Just hold on.

1979
01:28:32,710 --> 01:28:33,490
Just hold on.

1980
01:28:36,100 --> 01:28:37,240
Promise me?

1981
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:43,500
I promise.

1982
01:28:47,290 --> 01:28:48,160
I promise.

1983
01:29:00,610 --> 01:29:01,480
Ziggy?

1984
01:29:06,130 --> 01:29:06,920
Ziggy?

1985
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:16,710
[sobbing] Ziggy!

ZIGGY:
Lester couldn't save me.

1987
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:14,420
No one could.

1988
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:18,510
But like I said,

1989
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:20,990
no one stood for anyone
or anything until that day.

1990
01:30:23,210 --> 01:30:26,210
We thought Jackson
would testify against us.

1991
01:30:26,350 --> 01:30:29,300
But he flipped the script
and stood for us after all.

1992
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:33,400
Rodney went to the pen,

1993
01:30:33,530 --> 01:30:35,270
and he ended up
bendin' down and shit,

1994
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:36,620
but not like you think.

1995
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:39,230
I didn't believe it myself.

1996
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:45,020
Lynn did her bit,
but she got bounced out

1997
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:47,190
because of her kid and all.

1998
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:49,500
She wrote to Stephanie
for a while,

1999
01:30:49,630 --> 01:30:52,410
told her she named
her kid Zacharias.

2000
01:30:52,550 --> 01:30:54,110
Then her letters stopped coming.

2001
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:56,460
No one ever heard
from her again.

2002
01:31:00,510 --> 01:31:02,690
The judge took one look
at Rivers' act

2003
01:31:03,470 --> 01:31:05,650
and made him join the army,

2004
01:31:05,730 --> 01:31:09,520
figuring it would be crueler
than usual punishment.

2005
01:31:09,650 --> 01:31:11,740
But they were still sleepin'
on my boy Rivers,

2006
01:31:12,780 --> 01:31:13,650
'cause let me tell you,

2007
01:31:15,790 --> 01:31:17,960
it just put him
in a higher tax bracket.

2008
01:31:20,700 --> 01:31:23,180
Stephanie spent a year in jail.

2009
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:25,970
She's at St. John's now,
pre-med.

2010
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:28,360
She wants to open a free
clinic right here in Queens.

2011
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:34,200
Lester spent two years upstate.

2012
01:31:34,330 --> 01:31:36,810
After he got out,
he came back to Lincoln.

2013
01:31:37,890 --> 01:31:38,980
Knowles had been rehired,

2014
01:31:40,590 --> 01:31:42,770
and they left my place
just like it was.

2015
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:48,950
He's at City College now,
pre-law.

2016
01:31:52,260 --> 01:31:54,690
And every year,
Lester comes back,

2017
01:31:55,830 --> 01:31:58,260
and he tells them

2018
01:31:58,390 --> 01:32:00,350
how what we did
and what happened to me...

2019
01:32:01,830 --> 01:32:03,050
changed their lives too.

2020
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,450
My boy kept his promise
after all.

2021
01:32:09,710 --> 01:32:14,150
Knowles once said,
"It's not how long you live,"

2022
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:18,240
"but how you live
and what you leave behind."

2023
01:32:18,370 --> 01:32:19,500

2024
01:32:19,630 --> 01:32:22,460

or the lyrics Tupac laid down.

2026
01:32:25,730 --> 01:32:27,640
Look, all I know for sure...

2027
01:32:28,860 --> 01:32:30,600
is what you do
while you're on this planet,

2028
