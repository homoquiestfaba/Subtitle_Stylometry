00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,761
BRAD: (STAMMERS)
We're shooting a documentary.

171
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,763
- Who is shooting a documentary?
- Me and Sergio.

172
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,390
Remember I told you about that...
(STUTTERS) That day...

173
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,725
That thing that
we're doing, the other time?

174
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,269
- No, I don't remember.
- BRAD: Right, Serge?

175
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:38,522
Yeah, we're working on a movie
and we would appreciate your insight

176
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:39,899
into this whole ghost thing.

177
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,234
So just, you know,
if you wanna come over anytime,

178
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,944
you could totally help us out.

179
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,238
Um, I mean, I'm in.

180
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,949
- Yeah, I would love that. Yeah.
- BRAD: Oh, wow, all right.

181
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,035
FERNANDA:
Yeah, so, um, thank you so much.

182
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,078
It was amazing.
And then I'll see you guys soon,

183
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,955
- and we'll do...
- Yeah, just...

184
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,874
You know, you know where we live.

185
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,083
FERNANDA: All right, thanks.

186
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,710
- Thanks, it was a really fun night.
- BECKY: Bye.

187
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,253
BRAD: Yeah, it was.

188
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,671
- Bye.
- (BRAD GIGGLES)

189
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,757
I'm still not clear
what she was doing back there with you.

190
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,383
BRAD: She was fucking
snorting llello, bro.

191
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:07,468
What do you think she was doing?

192
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,553
- Were you doing that, Brad?
- BRAD: Of course not, Becky!

193
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,305
You think I'm gonna stoop that low?

194
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,140
- No.
- Of course not!

195
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,017
- You did, huh?
- BECKY: That's kinda bad.

196
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,810
- No! Serge, shut up.
- You did.

197
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,357
(MOUTHING) I fucked her.

198
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,526
Oh, yeah.

199
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,696
- Let me just see these...
- Don't be a dick!

200
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,323
- Come cuddle with me.
- BRAD: (CHUCKLES) No, no.

201
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,533
- Yeah, yeah!
- No. Let's make a sex tape.

202
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,993
Be my boyfriend. Baby, wait.

203
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:35,037
I'll bring you some breakfast, all right?

204
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,123
Sergio's room. Oh, shit.

205
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,833
(READING)

206
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:47,549
Ooh, I'm Chuck. I'm sober. Eh! Fuck you.

207
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,301
Hey, it's Chuck.

208
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,720
Um... (SIGHS)

209
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,557
So... I... (GRUNTS)

210
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,769
It's really hard going through
what I'm going through

211
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,981
and living with two dipshits.

212
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:05,901
The one, who looks
just as Mexican as the other one,

213
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,112
points out to me that he's Puerto Rican

214
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,322
and, like, tells me specifically.

215
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,491
How the fuck am I
supposed to know that?

216
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:16,662
All you guys do is cook Mexican food
and talk Mexican to each other.

217
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,790
Does a racist have
a black drug dealer named "Tug"?

218
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,251
No. (SIGHS)

219
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,461
Who I haven't seen in weeks.

220
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,131
CHUCK: What's this?
SERGIO: Hey, Chuck.

221
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,632
Why the fuck are you filming me?

222
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,175
Someone took a shit in our sink.

223
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,593
SERGIO: No, I think those are brownies.

224
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,012
- Oh, yeah, brownies?
- SERGIO: Oh, fuck.

225
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,555
Yeah, I know what shit smells like.

226
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,348
- (DOORBELL RINGS)
- Who the fuck is that?

227
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,101
Good morning, neighbor.
The noise level last night was...

228
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,269
Here's my theory, okay?

229
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,480
One of your pothead friends
decided to let his ass loose in our sink,

230
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,024
and instead of cleaning it up,

231
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,901
one of you two fuckwads
covered it up with a plate.

232
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,278
Am I right? Am I close?

233
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,071
- I wouldn't jump to conclusions.
- (DOORBELL RINGS)

234
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,198
Damn it. Motherfucker!

235
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,284
Hi. We'd just like to talk to you about...

236
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,286
Did you shit in my sink?

237
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,204
If I ever see you here again,

238
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,373
I'm gonna kill your friend.

239
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,084
- God damn it!
- Sorry, Chuck.

240
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:07,212
Shut the fuck up! You guys can have
your fucking parties, all right?

241
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,590
I'll go to my mom's house,
I'll play fucking Jenga.

242
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,216
Whatever! Okay?

243
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,718
But...

244
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:16,221
I just want a certain amount
of respect when I get home.

245
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,306
- (DOORBELL RINGS)
- Jesus fucking Christ!

246
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,557
Did you hear what the... Tits.

247
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,725
- Hi!
- Hey!

248
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,061
How are you? (CHUCKLES) Hi.

249
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,437
- Hey!
- SERGIO: Hi.

250
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,897
I'm sorry I didn't call,

251
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,732
but I didn't got your guys' numbers.

252
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,233
- It's not too early, right?
- BRAD: No, no.

253
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,069
SERGIO: Of course not.
BRAD: No, no, no. Not at all.

254
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,153
Have you seen the ghost?

255
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,279
CHUCK: What the fuck
are you talking about?

256
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,655
SERGIO: You know,
we should probably go to my room.

257
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,407
BRAD: (STUTTERS)
Let's go to my room, it's bigger.

258
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,202
Yeah, did you mean the room
with the naked Becky in bed?

259
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,787
BRAD: My friend Becky just...

260
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:41,914
- She got sick, so...
- Yeah.

261
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:45,042
BRAD: Yeah, let's go to your room.
FERNANDA: Okay!

262
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,587
Oh, let me just pick up.
I wasn't ready for the...

263
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:49,755
- Do you have a cold?
- Oh, I probably wouldn't...

264
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,424
I just... I was just, you know, sick.

265
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:57,888
Right here.

266
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,557
Watch it.

267
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,602
(WOMAN MOANING
THROUGH SPEAKERS)

268
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,145
FERNANDA: Wow.
SERGIO: Yeah.

269
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,980
- SERGIO: Are you in the fucking room?
- (FERNANDA CHUCKLES)

270
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,732
SERGIO: Ahhh! (WHIMPERS)

271
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,025
Okay, stop. You can probably...

272
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,151
Just go ahead and pause it right there.

273
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,444
- Okay.
- That was the ghost screaming,

274
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,113
- and that'd be like, that's the...
- Wow.

275
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,323
Yeah, so it was pretty gnarly,
as you can tell.

276
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,408
I think we should take this
to the next level,

277
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,119
maybe setting up a bunch of cameras.

278
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,495
That's a funny thing
that you should say that

279
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,623
because we were actually
in plans of getting

280
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,000
a whole lot of cameras.

281
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,378
The only thing is that we do have to
take advantage of this camera

282
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,756
that we have right now
until the big shipment comes in soon.

283
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:33,882
I probably wouldn't touch that.

284
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,175
Don't, please don't...
Just go ahead and leave it.

285
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,426
BARD: Yeah, he was sick. He was sick.

286
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:39,429
What I want is really
to understand this spirit,

287
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:42,724
or what is going on,

288
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,768
and we can maybe help it.

289
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,478
FERNANDA: You know, help this spirit.
SERGIO: Yeah, totally.

290
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,438
Another thing is that
we need to introduce ourselves.

291
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:50,524
- BRAD: Yeah.
- Maybe not so much Brad, but, like...

292
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,817
Actually, we should
probably interview you.

293
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,610
- What do you think about...
- BRAD: Yeah, we should interview you.

294
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:54,695
That's what we were
talking about earlier.

295
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,572
- We were talking about that.
- BRAD: That's what I had said.

296
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,323
But I don't look good today.

297
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,411
My name is Fernanda Matavilla Fuerte.

298
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,165
SERGIO: And how long have you been
interested in the paranormal?

299
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,750
Probably since my mom passed away,

300
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:15,424
I, um, always wanted to find ways to try
to communicate with her, so...

301
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,842
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know.

302
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,135
Mmm, it's okay.

303
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,929
- Have you ever seen a ghost?
- Yeah.

304
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,931
How many times?

305
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,934
- Six hundred, I don't know.
- BRAD: Six hundred times?

306
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:29,605
Well, I never really
counted them, but, yeah...

307
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,148
SERGIO:
But you've seen a lot of ghosts?

308
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,774
- BRAD: Six hundred.
- Mmm-hmm.

309
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,360
SERGIO: Could you tell us about
the first time you saw a ghost?

310
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:36,862
I was in love with this boy,

311
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,239
and I had all these emotions going,

312
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,283
you know, for my first kiss.

313
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,118
You know,
I thought he was the love of my life.

314
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:47,164
I still remember how, like, the first
time when he touched my lips

315
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:52,711
and, like, slowly came down and then
he's starting to touch all my body.

316
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:57,174
He's like... And go around
and then touching my breast

317
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,384
and then touching my nipple.

318
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:03,430
I still remember everything.

319
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,474
It was really... (CHUCKLES)

320
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,643
It was really good.

321
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:11,396
I found out that my love
left me for another girl

322
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,815
that was more developed than me.

323
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:17,069
(SIGHS) I just felt really lonely.

324
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:20,155
Like, all this pain was just a lot,

325
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,115
you know, when you're a little girl

326
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,035
and you don't have anybody to talk to.

327
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,703
Until one night,

328
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:31,708
I just felt, like,
this really warm presence next to me.

329
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:38,215
And all of a sudden,
I just felt, like, that comfort.

330
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,259
And it was my mom.

331
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,970
And she was next to me
and she told me,

332
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:48,642
"Fernanda, don't worry, it's okay.
(CHUCKLES)

333
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,521
"You'll find your true love,

334
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:57,526
"and you're gonna be
with him forever and ever

335
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,861
"and it'll be eternal love. "

336
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:02,823
Was that good? I'm sorry.

337
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,075
SERGIO: (STUTTERS) No, that was...

338
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,994
That was really good.
That was too good.

339
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,495
- (CHUCKLES) I'm sorry, I got all...
- BRAD: Hmm.

340
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,540
SERGIO: It's one of the best things
I've ever filmed.

341
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,250
Um...

342
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,460
Do you mind if I go to the bathroom?

343
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,629
SERGIO: No, go ahead. Take your time.
BRAD: Mmm-hmm.

344
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,048
Okay, thanks. (SNIFFLES)

345
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,968
BRAD: Holy fucking shit.

346
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:26,513
That is the hottest crazy chick
I have ever met in my life.

347
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,723
Come on, dude, she's not crazy.

348
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,308
BRAD: What do you mean
she's not fucking crazy, bro?

349
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:30,684
She believes in ghosts.

350
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,060
Were you not there with the footage?

351
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,520
Did you not hear what I heard?

352
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,647
Oh, my God,
those are called orgasms, Sergio, okay?

353
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:36,815
It's not a big fucking deal to me.

354
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,817
It's not some fucking
alien sound, all right?

355
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:43,280
BRAD: (MOCKINGLY) Oh, my God,
I wanna do that to her all the time.

356
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,824
- I'm not proud of what I'm about to do...
- BRAD: What?

357
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,868
- So you just listen closely.
- What's going on?

358
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:51,496
I'm gonna need you to really
do me a favor, all right?

359
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,582
You have a bunch
of crazy chicks that you can fuck,

360
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,418
and all I'm asking is that
you stay away from this one.

361
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:57,669
Whoa!

362
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:58,920
Why?

363
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,883
Because I feel like I like her.

364
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,302
- You feel... Oh, fuck you.
- Shut up.

365
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,887
Listen to me, okay? You don't...

366
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,806
That guy right there,
you see that guy? Are you looking?

367
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,683
That guy, he knows.

368
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,186
You don't fall in love
with a crazy chick, okay?

369
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,563
They will fuck you up.
Did you get that or no?

370
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,649
Yeah, maybe I wanna get fucked up.
You ever think of that?

371
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:22,027
What are you, fucking Rihanna?

372
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,320
(SIGHS)

373
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,739
You gonna back off?

374
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:28,200
I wanna hear it. I wanna hear it
out of your fucking mouth.

375
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,659
- Just say it.
- What do you want me to say?

376
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,495
- Back off.
- To you?

377
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,163
Just say you're gonna back off from her.

378
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,289
- No!
- Say it.

379
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,457
- No!
- Say it.

380
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,583
- No!
- Say it.

381
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,126
Now, just now,

382
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,545
because of all of this, for your sake,

383
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,755
I'm definitely fucking her.

384
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,299
I can't even remember the last time
I felt something for someone.

385
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,759
And I'm just... (STUTTERS)

386
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,177
- If you could...
- I'm pretty sure you felt so...

387
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,261
- Hey, guys. Sorry.
- Don't worry.

388
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:49,388
We're gonna have
to take it back from the...

389
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:50,806
I had to make a poopie.

390
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,183
Um, I think we should
do more research about this.

391
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,393
- Yeah.
- BRAD: Mmm-hmm

392
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:57,396
I would love to know more
about these murders and...

393
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,398
- Right. The what?
- The what?

394
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:04,111
FERNANDA: When I put, um,
your address on Google, this came up.

395
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,904
SERGIO: Okay.
BRAD: Holy shit! That's the house!

396
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,448
FERNANDA: I guess
this Lady Azalea died here.

397
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:09,658
SERGIO: Wait. What, who died?

398
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,909
BRAD: What the fuck
is a pleasure house?

399
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,411
SERGIO: Wait.
What do you mean she died?

400
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:17,958
It says, "If you want to know more about
the story of the house, buy the book. "

401
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,252
- Well, how much is the book?
- $49.99.

402
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,628
- BRAD: What the fuck?
- What?

403
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:25,465
FERNANDA: Right here it said that
the author lives in Pasadena.

404
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,092
So I think we should contact him.

405
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,302
SERGIO: Why don't we just contact him
instead of buying the book?

406
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:30,429
BRAD: That's what I was just thinking.

407
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:31,513
No, I think he should be in the movie.

408
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,597
Go straight to the horse's mouth.

409
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,266
Brad, I'm hungry!

410
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,767
- Hey!
- Hi. How are you?

411
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:37,602
- Great, you're here.
- (BOTH CHUCKLE)

412
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,354
BRAD: Hey.

413
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,356
SERGIO: All right, is that good?
You got it?

414
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,607
Perfect. Perfect.

415
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:43,817
SERGIO: All right.
BRAD: Nice!

416
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:44,985
- It's a good angle, huh?
- BRAD: Nice.

417
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,278
- All right, here we go. You ready?
- Yes, sir.

418
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,780
Okay, so camera, camera. Back it up.

419
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,824
Uh, there's a camera by the bathroom.

420
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,160
We have cameras
all around the living room.

421
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:56,121
So basically,
if it's happening, we're gonna see it.

422
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:59,458
- Oh, we're working with Billy Chen, huh?
- Billy Chen!

423
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,376
- He's a very talented undergrad...
- (WHOOPS)

424
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,420
...and he also knows
what good an opportunity this is.

425
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,547
- (YELLS)
- Oh, shit!

426
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,257
I wasn't scared, I just laughed
because you were...

427
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,550
- Oh, okay.
- This is Fernanda,

428
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,801
the newest member of our group.

429
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,136
- Hola.
- CHUCK: Hey, assholes.

430
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,846
Ching Chong,
get that fucking thing out of my face.

431
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,389
Off limits, or I'll kill you!

432
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,433
- Am I lying? Am I joking right now?
- SERGIO: No, you're not.

433
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,517
(DOOR SLAMS)

434
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,186
Hey, Billy Chen, man, don't...
Don't take that personal.

435
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,563
You know, he's not being a racist
'cause he's really racist.

436
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,315
He's just, like,
not happy about the cameras,

437
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,984
so, you know, his bark is worse
than his preconceived notions.

438
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:29,613
Yeah, I'm not happy that he didn't tell us
three motherfuckers died here, all right?

439
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:30,989
Okay, but you gotta
take it down a notch...

440
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,157
- Fuck him!
- ... with the Jay-Z.

441
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,910
- I'll tell him to his face.
- Shh! Stop.

442
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:37,913
Gangsta.

443
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,291
- (DOORBELL RINGS)
- Let's be professional, guys.

444
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,878
Hello, Professor Menapace, I'm Brad.

445
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,589
- We, uh, contacted...
- Hi!

446
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,965
- Hi.
- Hi.

447
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,051
- FERNANDA: Um...
- You must be Fernanda.

448
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,178
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to see you.

449
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,055
It's such a pleasure to have you here.

450
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,264
Yes.

451
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,682
Um, if you can just take a seat,

452
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,684
we'll kinda go over
what we're gonna be talking about.

453
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,395
I have... I have lots of questions
set up, and so, if you could...

454
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,688
MENAPACE: Why don't I sit here?

455
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,815
I think this is a better spot.

456
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,442
Yeah, but we already...
See, what happened is,

457
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,069
like, we set up light... Okay.

458
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,658
- All right. Perfect.
- SERGIO: Perfect.

459
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,702
And so, if we could just start with
your name and where you're from.

460
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,538
Professor Menapace.

461
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,665
I have a PhD in History from Brown.

462
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,042
I was a nominated finalist
for the Pulitzer Prize

463
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,044
for my New York Times essay

464
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:30,131
chronicling harlotry
in the early 20th century.

465
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:34,219
How did you become interested
in this particular case of Lady Azalea?

466
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,971
She was a pioneer

467
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:39,140
uh, in her field, uh,

468
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,393
as a prostitute.

469
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:46,648
She allowed us to breathe sexually.

470
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,234
The Golden Shower,

471
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,154
the Dirty Sanchez,
the Glass Bottom Boat,

472
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:56,533
Ebenezer's Jam, Casper's Wish,
the Boston Cream Pie,

473
00:17:56,826 --> 00:18:00,203
I mean, these are things that
you can all trace back to Lady Azalea.

474
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,664
- Can I talk to you?
- FERNANDA: Um...

475
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,249
I wanna hear...

476
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,501
I wanna hear you
ask me some questions.

477
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,211
Do you mind?

478
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:09,588
Right. (STAMMERS)
I mean, I'm kind of...

479
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,631
MENAPACE: I'm feeling...
No, I'm feeling a nice...

480
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:12,924
- Yeah.
- Switch it up.

481
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,593
- Yeah, that will be fine.
- Just...

482
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:15,677
Sure, sure, sure.

483
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,761
FERNANDA: I'm gonna switch too, and...

484
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,597
- Thank you, I appreciate it.
- FERNANDA: Yes. (CLEARS THROAT)

485
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,348
- Much better.
- Oh.

486
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,976
(CLEARS THROAT)

487
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,395
Um, do... (SIGHS)

488
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,230
(WHISPERS) First question is, uh...

489
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,773
(WHISPERS) First question is...

490
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,483
Stop. I'm not playing telephone with you.

491
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,861
Ask... Ask about the homicide.

492
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,032
Do you know anything
about the homicides?

493
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,867
"Homo" what?

494
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,076
Oh, homicides.

495
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:42,287
- Homicides?
- Yes.

496
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,122
- The murders?
- Mmm-hmm.

497
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,166
We're human beings

498
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,960
with desires.

499
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:53,882
And sometimes,
we can't control our desires.

500
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,344
Lady Azalea snapped!

501
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:03,558

Guys, guys, guys...

843
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,531
- Sergio, let's go back.
- No, listen, listen, guys, we're...

844
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:15,534
We gotta take it down a notch.
This is too much.

845
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,495
- What do you mean?
- We're getting in too deep.

846
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,788
We need to pull out.
We need to pull out, guys.

847
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:21,081
- The ghost, the ghost.
- BECKY: Oh, my God.

848
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,000
(GRUNTS)
It's in Chuck's body and it wants...

849
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:26,003
No! There is no ghost
inside of Chuck's body, okay?

850
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:27,880
What? Are you retarded?

851
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,507
Jesus! What is wrong with you?

852
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:30,841
- No!
- What is wrong with you?

853
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:33,135
- There's no ghost in Chuck's body!
- Were you there?

854
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,178
- Yeah, I was there.
- Brad!

855
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:37,014
- That's just Chuck, okay? Right, Serge?
- SERGIO: Please!

856
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,849
Let's just compromise.

857
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:40,518
We'll go back,
but we need to chill right now,

858
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:41,852
because we don't know
how Chuck is right now.

859
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:44,355
Whether there's a ghost
or whether there is...

860
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,606
- Serge, are you scared?
- No, I'm not scared.

861
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,691
- Well, you're being scared.
- Physically, Chuck will hurt me.

862
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,652
Your heart's beating. Listen to me.

863
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:50,778
Just talk to me,

864
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,613
- calm down, breathe.
- BRAD: Look, look, everyone, stop it.

865
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,490
- I'm here with you.
- Listen, stop it. Hey!

00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,242
BECKY: I've got an announcement.
BRAD: Hey! No.

867
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:57,660
- Stop that over there.
- Big, important announcement.

868
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:58,827
Get them, Brad.

869
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,955
- Everybody.
- Listen to Becky.

I've been watching in this room

872
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:09,213

- Thank you so much!

00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,132
- No!
- I'm gonna go over there

875
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:13,551
- and get the ghost!
- No!

00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:16,178
- Guys, I actually...
- I think that's a good idea.

877
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:18,222
I think the ghost actually liked Becky.

878
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,307
- Yeah, I think that's a great idea.
- And, yeah.

879

No, I think Becky
would be a great addition to the...

880
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,269
No... I agree, I agree.

881
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:25,312
Hey, Becky, I think it's a great energy

882
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,189

- Sorry, Chuck.

915
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,976
Doesn't it jump from
one page to another?

916
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:47,061
- Yeah, it does.
- Like, it skips,

917
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,646
like 20 pages or something?
I noticed that.

918
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:50,481
We need that chapter for possession.

Okay, so...

This was a demonstration
of how she senses things about people.

927
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:10,834
I used to always come here
and I would always think, like,

928
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:13,837
my dog is being a real bitch
and she's also really stupid.

929
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:16,423
She just sits
and she stares and she growls.

930
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:17,508
SERGIO: Mmm-hmm.

931
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:19,843
- Yeah.
- But then you saw the ghost.

932
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,679
And then I started figuring it out.

933
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:23,347
Chanel's gonna find the ghost.

934
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,684
We're gonna let her loose and
wherever she stares or growls,

935
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,352
that will be where the ghost is.

936
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,020
SERGIO: I believe it's an awesome idea.

937
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:32,690
I think we should
totally just go with it. Don't you think?

938
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:34,900
- Oh, yeah. I mean, yeah.
- SERGIO: Right?

939
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,694
BECKY: Get the ghost, Chanel.
Where's the ghost?

940
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:38,112
Go get the ghost.

941
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,280

00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:46,203
Try and get the ghost.

- Go get the ghost, Chanel.

Get the ghost, Chanel.

watching the dog, please?

- What do you mean?

I mean, if you believed in her,

950
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:56,004
she would be going to get the ghost.

951
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:57,965
- I believe in her.
- I don't think you do.

ooh, ooh, ooh

Hey, man. We're kind of in the middle...

1013
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,357
Can you shut up for a second,
okay? Nobody cares.

1014
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,568
If you can respect your friend
a little bit, okay?

1015
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:25,362
Because he's going through
something very difficult right now.

1016
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:28,240
And I think that I should go out

1017
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:31,285
and swallow my sorrows

1018
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,496

1019
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:36,582
and then we all get laid.

1020
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,959
Because tonight,

1021
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,669
everybody gets laid!

00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,045
- All right?
- I don't think that's a good idea.

1023
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,923
I'm pretty sure that's
gonna happen, all right?

- FERNANDA: Whoo!

Yeah, I mean, if we go as a team...

- As a team, we should definitely...
- Yes.

- Yes.

1073

Listen to me, opium comes from Asia.

1074

And the Japanese said, "Opium. "

1075
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:07,816
And that's how they came up
with the name,

1076
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,485
but it really comes from Papote,
that's the name of the plant.

- Papote?
- And it was grown in Asia

And it's kind of racist to Billy
that you said that.

Is it racist that
I say weed was founded in Jamaica,

1083

Because I just fucked a ghost.

00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:56,062
Can I...

1176
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:59,232
I would love to have
an interview with you.

1177
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:01,901
I mean, you know, if that's what...

1178
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:05,322
If that's what we need to do.
I mean, it's kind...

1179
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:07,991
- It was kind of scary, you know?
- Yeah, I bet.

1180
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,827
Could we do it without...

1181
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:12,370
Could we do it without you?

1182
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:13,663
BRAD: It's kind of personal, Serge.

1183
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:15,248
- Is it?
- And you're just always,

1184
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:17,000
you know,
making jokes out of stuff, so...

1185
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,710
- Do you mind?
- SERGIO: I'm just,

1186
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,086
I'm thinking before I start...

1187
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:22,339
Can you please, Serge?
This is personal, man.

1188
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:24,174
That's cool, that works.

1189
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:26,426
- I'm sorry, Brad.

1191
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:31,765
How do you feel?

1192
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,058
I mean, was this something that

1193
00:47:33,142 --> 00:47:35,894
you always wanted to have
as an experience?

1194
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,732
- I guess so.
- Mmm-hmm.

1195
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:43,610
Before you went to bed,

1196
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:48,948
you were feeling sad, happy, horny?

1197
00:47:49,158 --> 00:47:50,909
I was... I was tired.

1198
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:53,286
That's why I fell asleep, but...

1199
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,205
Mmm-hmm.

1200
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,832
I guess I was a little bit horny.

1201
00:47:57,917 --> 00:48:00,418
- You're a very horny man.
- Yes.

1202
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:05,256
I think she sensed
when there's lust around,

1203
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:08,134
when there's this sexual charge.

1204
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:10,678
Right?

1205
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:13,681
- Mmm-hmm.
- See, that night that there was the party,

1206
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:15,642
there was sex around.

1207
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,685
And, you know,
she showed up with Sergio.

1208
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:20,230
The other day at the sance when
I was having these weird feelings

1209
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:22,816
towards Sergio,
and then that happened,

1210
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,609
and then you...

1211
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,070
You took it to the next level.

1212
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:31,199
Are you sexually charged now?

1213
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:33,701
Do you feel sexually charged?

1214
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:37,080
- Yeah.
- Are you ready for a test, maybe?

1215
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,666
If you want, we can test her?

1216
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:42,585
Yeah. I mean,
I'm feeling pretty, you know, charged up.

01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:16,821
- I was worried about you!
- I'm feeling very vulnerable

1511
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:18,114
and I need you guys
to please leave right now.

1512
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:20,282
- Did you see the ghost?
- I didn't see the ghost.

1513
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:22,451
- I didn't either.
- So it didn't work out,

1514
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:24,787
and now I just need five minutes
to put some underwear on.

1515
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,455
Please, just don't sit,
don't touch my bed...

1516
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,290
Where's your underwear?
I'll get them for you.

1517
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,543
No, don't get
my underwear for me. Stop it!

1518

What's up, Billy?

1519
01:00:37,926 --> 01:00:40,803
I mean, there are things
that I'd be willing to do for research

1520
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:42,721
and there are things that...

1521
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:45,558
Just too much sometimes.

01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,522
No, the real deal.

your boobs and stuff.

1537
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:25,931
I just never felt this way, you know?

1538
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:28,267
I don't even wanna fuck you,
I wanna make love to you.

1539
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:30,311
The project, you know,
is more important

1540
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:31,854
than whatever's happening

bring him around sometime,

01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:39,820
just so he doesn't feel weird
about stuff, that's totally cool.

I feel like dancing,
you know what I'm saying?

1545
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:43,908
I'm in love, I'm in love
and I don't care who knows it!

1546
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:45,951
What I'm trying to say
is that I'm a grown-ass man

1547
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:50,497
and you don't need to
worry a damn thing, girl. I'm serious.

the second, fast forward...

where it starts, so we're backtracking.

know if this is recording.

- What is that?

At least he's not doing cocaine
and shit. He's way nicer on opium.

This is not the face of a man that's
on opium or any other kind of drug.

- Yes, it is.
- This is a man

It's O.P.P. face.

that he's wearing an Asian...

he's a fucking artist, well-rounded.

we should probably...

- It's Ricardo.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1995
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:47,073
You'll blow my fucking game.

1996
01:19:47,157 --> 01:19:48,491
- BRAD: Careful.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1997
01:19:48,575 --> 01:19:50,618
You guys don't wanna blow my game,
man. She thinks I'm a ghost.

1998
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:52,203
- That's cool.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, you got my shit?

1999
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:54,747
- Yep. Got cash for you.
- Cash money, good, good, good.

2000
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:56,582
- Yeah.
- Smells good.

2001
01:19:56,667 --> 01:19:57,875
(MANIACAL LAUGHTER)

2002
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,252
Hey, guys, really, bring it in here.

2003
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:01,462
Chico! Hi, Serge, Brad!

2004
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:05,633
You guys wanna come and play
Ouija and ride the white demon?

2005
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:07,635
- Demon! Yeah!
- Whoo! Whoo!

2006
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:08,970
Whoo! (LAUGHS)

2007
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:10,096
(LAUGHS)

2008
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:12,098
FERNANDA: I'm kidding.
You guys want queso fundido?

2009
01:20:12,182 --> 01:20:14,100
- Yeah, yeah.
- SERGIO: No, no, no, we're good. No.

2010
01:20:14,184 --> 01:20:15,810
Cheese?
They're good on the cheese, babe.

2011
01:20:15,894 --> 01:20:17,145
Okay, mi amor.

2012
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:18,313
SERGIO: No cheese for us.

2013
01:20:18,397 --> 01:20:20,273
Oh, man.
She's pretty crazy about ghosts.

2014
01:20:20,357 --> 01:20:22,066
- SERGIO: Yeah, no kidding.
- Don't worry. I got it under control.

2015
01:20:22,151 --> 01:20:24,444
Okay, that's a real gun. You know what?
You can't really shoot ghosts.

2016
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:26,696
- CHUCK: You can shoot anything.
- Chuck, are you sure you wanna...

2017
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:29,782
Oh, shit! I was, um... Oh!

2018
01:20:29,867 --> 01:20:31,242
Yeah.

2019
01:20:34,413 --> 01:20:35,580
Whoo!

2020
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:38,708
Well, survived one, there.
We'll see him next time.

2021
01:20:38,792 --> 01:20:42,128
Let's get out of here
before it gets crazy. Come on.

2022
01:20:43,589 --> 01:20:46,007
- I wanted some queso fundido.
- You wanted queso?

2023
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:48,176
- It just... It sounded really good.
- We'll get you queso.

2024
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:50,261
- I just...
- It's all right. You don't want that queso.

2025
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:51,596
Nobody should ever have that.

2026
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:53,097
