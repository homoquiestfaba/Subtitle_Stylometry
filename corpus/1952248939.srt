1
00:03:42,035 --> 00:03:43,366
Where you from?

2
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,765
I'm from Holland, and this is like...

3
00:03:46,506 --> 00:03:48,701
Ten hours for me.
It's, like, across the world.

4
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:50,536
I came here for this audition.

5
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:54,213
I told all my boys at home I'm coming
to funk in front of Michael onstage.

6
00:03:54,414 --> 00:03:57,747
I'm just gonna dance for him. I don't care
if I make it, I don't care about nothing.

7
00:03:58,018 --> 00:03:59,713
Thank you, Michael. I'm excited.

8
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,050
You've inspired everything
in my life. My energy.

9
00:04:04,257 --> 00:04:05,554
You're why I dance.

10
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:08,887
I can remember being a little girl and
watching "Thriller" on TV with my mom

11
00:04:09,095 --> 00:04:11,655
and thinking that that was
the coolest thing in the world.

12
00:04:11,898 --> 00:04:15,334
I go to sleep and just wake up,
and the first thing I do is not even eat.

13
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:20,472
I just start playing your music and start
just dancing and moonwalking on a rug.

14
00:04:20,674 --> 00:04:24,110
I was like, "What I would give
to be onstage with you."

15
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:28,304
And the fact that I get to do
that is... It's amazing, so...

16
00:04:28,982 --> 00:04:31,450
I'm from Australia...

17
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:39,455
And, um, I got word of your audition
two days before it was about to happen

18
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:42,457
and I was on the next flight over.

19
00:04:42,762 --> 00:04:46,789
It begins. This is... This is the
beginning. I'm not even onstage yet.

20
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,937
Like, I can't even imagine what's gonna
happen backstage that first show in London.

21
00:04:52,138 --> 00:04:56,575
I'm looking even farther ahead. I don't even know
what I wanna do after this because this is Michael.

22
00:04:56,776 --> 00:04:58,607
I wanted to dance,
you know what I mean?

23
00:04:58,812 --> 00:05:01,474
And that inspiration came from,
you know, you.

24
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:05,947
And you've inspired me and given me
a reason to want to inspire others.

25
00:05:06,586 --> 00:05:08,383
Uh...

26
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:10,588
Life is hard, right?

27
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,123
And I've kind of been searching for
something to shake me up a little bit

28
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:19,355
and give me a kind of a meaning,
to believe in something.

29
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:22,796
And this is it.

30
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,849
So we open the show, as
you know, with all the lights down.

31
00:05:44,057 --> 00:05:47,549
We're gonna create a spectacular
opening with pyrotechnics.

32
00:05:47,761 --> 00:05:50,730
And we want some sizzles
and some cracks and some pops.

33
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:54,388
We have our video that is called
"Glimpses and Flashes."

34
00:05:54,901 --> 00:05:59,429
And that's where Light Man comes out
on the gantry, floating above the stage,

35
00:05:59,673 --> 00:06:04,736
and he'll just be dazzling
in video information.

36
00:06:07,747 --> 00:06:10,272
And piece by piece
by piece by piece,

37
00:06:10,517 --> 00:06:13,008
MJ is revealed, until he jumps out

38
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:15,881
and on Michael's command,
we begin.

39
00:06:32,238 --> 00:06:33,933
# You wanna be startin' somethin' #

40
00:06:34,174 --> 00:06:35,607
# You got to be startin' somethin' #

41
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:37,572
# You wanna be startin' somethin' #

42
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:39,437
# Startin' somethin' #

43
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:42,204
# Hard to get over #

# Yeah, yeah #

45
00:06:43,717 --> 00:06:45,184
# Stuck in the middle #

00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:47,182
# And the pain is thunder #

# Hard to get over #

48
00:06:49,122 --> 00:06:50,612
# Too low to get under #
# Yeah, yeah #

00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,917
# Stuck in the middle #
# Yeah, yeah #

50
00:06:53,126 --> 00:06:54,889
# And the pain is thunder #
# Yeah, yeah #

51
00:06:55,061 --> 00:06:56,926
# You love to pretend
That you're good #

52
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,189
# When you're always
Up to no good #

53
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:02,498
# So your tongue became a razor #

54
00:07:02,736 --> 00:07:04,260
# Someone's always #
# Tryin' #

55
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:06,063
# To start my baby #
# Cryin' #

56
00:07:07,107 --> 00:07:08,131
# Lyin' #

00:07:08,308 --> 00:07:10,606
# Now baby's

# Startin' somethin' #

59
00:07:12,011 --> 00:07:13,603
# You got to be #
# Startin' somethin' #

60
00:07:13,913 --> 00:07:15,710
# I said you wanna be #
# Startin' somethin' #

61
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:17,839
# Startin' somethin' #

62
00:07:18,084 --> 00:07:20,109
# Hard to get over #
# Yeah, yeah #

63
00:07:20,453 --> 00:07:21,511
# Yeah, yeah #

64
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:23,279
# Stuck in the middle #
# Yeah, yeah #

65
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:25,321
# And the pain is thunder #
# Yeah, yeah #

00:07:25,492 --> 00:07:27,926

# You're a vegetable #
# You're a vegetable #

# You're a vegetable #
# You're a vegetable #

72
00:07:36,936 --> 00:07:38,528
# Still they hate you #
# Still they hate you #

00:07:38,738 --> 00:07:40,467
# You're a vegetable #
# You're a vegetable #

74
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,437
# A buffet #

# They eat off of you #
# They eat off of you #

00:07:46,513 --> 00:07:49,311
# You're a vegetable
Ow! #

78
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:04,693
# He-he-he-ha ##

79
00:08:17,677 --> 00:08:19,201
You know I'm gonna
want that more, right?

80
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,147
It's funkier.

81
00:08:22,348 --> 00:08:24,043
I'm not feeling
that part enough.

82
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:30,785
As in running next to him.

83
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,651
- It's not there.
- Okay, it should be.

84
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:34,827
It should be.
I know, it's all for love.

85
00:08:35,028 --> 00:08:37,861
It's coming there.
We'll get it there.

86
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:44,068
# Your love is magical #

87
00:08:44,304 --> 00:08:47,865
# That's how I feel #

88
00:08:48,074 --> 00:08:54,411
# But I have not the words
To explain #

89
00:08:54,614 --> 00:08:57,879
# To tell you #

90
00:08:58,084 --> 00:08:59,244
# I love you ##

91
00:09:02,322 --> 00:09:04,415
<i>Jackson's ETA is 15 minutes.</i>

92
00:09:04,624 --> 00:09:07,923
Michael Jackson last performed
live right here in London

93
00:09:08,127 --> 00:09:10,459
at the 2006 World Music Awards.

94
00:09:10,697 --> 00:09:14,098
<i>Michael
Jackson's here. Go straight onstage.</i>

95
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:15,861
<i>This is it!</i>

96
00:09:16,836 --> 00:09:17,860
Yeah!

97
00:09:18,238 --> 00:09:21,366
This is it. This is it.

98
00:09:22,342 --> 00:09:25,243
<i>This is it! This is it!</i>

99
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:29,105
I love you.

100
00:09:30,516 --> 00:09:32,450
We love you!

101
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:39,624
I'll be... I'll be performing the songs
my fans wanna hear.

102
00:09:40,627 --> 00:09:44,620
This is really it.
This is the final curtain call.

103
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:48,493
Okay? And see you in July.

104
00:09:57,644 --> 00:09:59,441
# If you can't feed your baby #
# Yeah, yeah #

105
00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:01,239
# Then don't have a baby #
# Yeah, yeah #

106
00:10:01,414 --> 00:10:03,006
# And don't think maybe #
# Yeah, yeah #

107
00:10:03,249 --> 00:10:05,945
# If you can't feed your baby #
# Yeah, yeah #

00:10:10,957 --> 00:10:12,822
# Now baby's slowly dyin' #

# You got to be #

00:10:16,596 --> 00:10:18,188
# You wanna be #

# Too low to get under #

# You're stuck in the middle #
# Yeah, yeah #

123
00:10:35,114 --> 00:10:36,547
# Lift your head up high #

124
00:10:36,783 --> 00:10:38,614
# And scream out to the world #

125
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:40,285
# I know I am someone #

126
00:10:40,486 --> 00:10:42,147
# And let the truth unfurl #

127
00:10:42,355 --> 00:10:44,118
# No one can hurt you now #

128
00:10:44,324 --> 00:10:46,292
# Because you know what's true #

129
00:10:46,492 --> 00:10:47,925

Ma ma coo sa #

169
00:11:58,865 --> 00:12:00,730
# You wanna be startin' somethin' #

170
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:02,560
# You got to be #
# Startin' somethin' #

171
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:04,532
# I said you wanna be #
# Startin' somethin' #

172
00:12:04,737 --> 00:12:07,035
# Ooh! #
# Startin' somethin' ##

173
00:12:20,286 --> 00:12:22,948
Good. Great. Good to see all of
you. Thank you for being here.

174
00:12:24,557 --> 00:12:29,119
The idea was get the big fish from all over
the world and put them in the same pond.

175
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:35,659
The dancers in
a Michael Jackson show

176
00:12:35,835 --> 00:12:37,962
are an extension
of Michael Jackson.

177
00:12:38,171 --> 00:12:40,662
They are an extension of the man.

178
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:44,343
Everything is bigger
and more intense in his world.

179
00:12:44,577 --> 00:12:46,044
First cut, thank you.

180
00:12:53,586 --> 00:12:55,486
Next group. Ladies, brava.

181
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,255
Lean, gorgeous, hot.

182
00:13:02,462 --> 00:13:05,329
Dancers that can rock it.
But if you don't have that goo,

183
00:13:05,565 --> 00:13:08,432
that ooze coming out of you,
not gonna get the job.

184
00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:12,834
# Don't
stop till you get enough Ow! ##

185
00:13:23,015 --> 00:13:24,573
She's the one.

186
00:13:25,985 --> 00:13:32,481
<i>And the Michael Jackson principal
dancers for This Is It are:</i>

187
00:13:47,874 --> 00:13:50,308
Guys, those go over here.

188
00:13:51,043 --> 00:13:53,307
Hey, guys?
Those go over here, actually.

189
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:54,537
Aww.

190
00:13:54,714 --> 00:13:56,511
Truss moving.

191
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:03,880
Quite the eventful day
because we got to be toasted.

192
00:14:04,223 --> 00:14:07,750
There's elevator speed
and toaster speed.

193
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:11,196
Part of this, guys,
is anticipating the stop.

194
00:14:12,398 --> 00:14:14,832
Keep your shoulders square,
keep your center,

195
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:18,401
and just get, like, right down into
a nice, good squat position like that,

196
00:14:18,638 --> 00:14:20,162
and you're gonna come up and...

197
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:22,841
You feel that initial...?
Yeah, I do.

198
00:14:23,042 --> 00:14:24,634
Yeah, that's
the adrenaline, baby.

# Give it to me #

251
00:17:20,386 --> 00:17:25,847
# Got to get it
You just want to give it ##

252
00:17:30,262 --> 00:17:33,231
We're at Culver Studios,
shooting green screen.

253
00:17:33,432 --> 00:17:37,334
We're gonna do "The Drill" into "Cadence"
into "They Don't Really Care About Us."

254
00:17:37,536 --> 00:17:40,471
And it's gonna be really cool because
they're gonna multiply the guys.

255
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:46,037
So our existing 11 guys
are gonna become 1100 guys,

256
00:17:46,245 --> 00:17:47,940
and it'll be really, really cool.

257
00:17:48,147 --> 00:17:50,581
So we're kind of excited.
And Michael's coming today.

258
00:17:50,783 --> 00:17:52,250
- There's the man.
- There's Michael.

259
00:17:52,451 --> 00:17:53,440
The man is here.

260
00:17:53,652 --> 00:17:55,347
Whoo! Ow! Ow!

261
00:17:55,554 --> 00:17:58,455
So that we can give you this:
A million people.

262
00:17:58,657 --> 00:18:00,591
Michael, do you like this,
first of all?

263
00:18:00,793 --> 00:18:04,661
Yeah, that's a cool move, a cool move,
but it spreads out too much to the end.

264
00:18:04,897 --> 00:18:07,388
So we can just stop it
whenever you hit the space bar.

265
00:18:07,566 --> 00:18:09,090
You can go to infinity.

266
00:18:09,268 --> 00:18:10,735
Yeah. As though
there's no more than

267
00:18:10,936 --> 00:18:15,771
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 perhaps?
Or maybe just your nine dancers?

268
00:18:15,975 --> 00:18:17,169
Ten.
Great.

269
00:18:18,244 --> 00:18:20,405
# Bah ooh bah ooh bah #

270
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:23,410
What is that?

271
00:18:23,616 --> 00:18:25,982
# Jah ooh aah uh aah #

272
00:18:26,185 --> 00:18:28,244
One more time.
Six, seven, eight...

273
00:18:36,128 --> 00:18:37,618
# Who? #

274
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,397

# Bang bang, shot dead #

284
00:19:45,898 --> 00:19:47,058
# Everybody's gone mad #

285
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:50,862
# All I wanna say is that

# The proclamation promised me
Free liberty, now #

00:20:10,856 --> 00:20:12,881
# I'm tired of bein'

# They're throwing me

<i>In what will go down in history</i>

303

00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:36,488

341
00:23:36,729 --> 00:23:39,220
# Is just an apple #

342
00:23:39,431 --> 00:23:42,798

# Reaching out #

352
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:09,659
# Into the night-time #

353
00:24:09,862 --> 00:24:13,491
# Electric eyes are everywhere #

354
00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:16,494

355
00:24:16,735 --> 00:24:19,329

356
00:24:19,538 --> 00:24:23,235

371
00:25:19,097 --> 00:25:22,032

# Oh, why? ##

401
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:28,658
# Put the blame on Mame, boys #

402
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,352
# Put the blame on Mame #

403
00:27:32,564 --> 00:27:37,194
# Mame did a dance
Called the Hitchy-koo #

404
00:27:37,436 --> 00:27:41,532
# That's the thing
That slew McGrew #

405
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:45,073
# Put the blame on Mame, boys #

406
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,538
We're seconds away, Mike.

407
00:27:46,745 --> 00:27:48,372
- Rolling.
- Rolling.

408
00:27:48,547 --> 00:27:50,208
And Gilda singing.

409
00:27:50,449 --> 00:27:54,010
# Put the blame #

410
00:27:54,219 --> 00:27:59,748
# On Mame ##

411
00:28:00,826 --> 00:28:02,487
Bravo!

412
00:28:13,205 --> 00:28:14,502
What's he doing here?

413
00:28:27,719 --> 00:28:29,880
And cut. Ha-ha-ha.
That was a good one.

414
00:28:30,088 --> 00:28:31,521
Let's cut.

415
00:28:31,723 --> 00:28:32,849
- Okay, Bruce?
- Yes, sir?

416
00:28:33,025 --> 00:28:35,118
Rehearsed, and Michael
was great. We can do this.

417
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,349
- Ready to shoot?
- Yup.

418
00:28:36,561 --> 00:28:39,291
- Okay, guys, let's shoot this.
- Here we go, ready.

419
00:28:39,498 --> 00:28:41,864
- We are rolling.
- Action.

420
00:28:52,411 --> 00:28:55,710
What do you want me to do? Count
three like they do in the movies?

421
00:29:10,595 --> 00:29:12,256
Guys, that's the cue.

422
00:29:12,464 --> 00:29:14,762
I'm sorry, are we
misunderstanding something here?

423
00:29:14,966 --> 00:29:16,024
No, we're not misunderstanding.

424
00:29:16,234 --> 00:29:17,223
We're sizzling.

425
00:29:17,436 --> 00:29:18,767
He's sizzling.
I'm sizzling.

426
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:20,528
He's waiting for my point,
it's coming.

427
00:29:20,705 --> 00:29:21,933
Oh, I thought...

428
00:29:22,107 --> 00:29:26,305
Michael, I was telling them to start when
you turn toward the audience. Do you wanna...?

429
00:29:26,545 --> 00:29:30,538
Oh, no, I wanna turn first,
face the audience with nothing.

430
00:29:30,749 --> 00:29:31,773
Okay.

431
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:34,145
And then when he gets
my cue, then we go.

432
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:39,586
The only thing is how will you see
the video change from the marquee to the city?

433
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:42,449
I gotta feel that. I'll feel it,
the screen behind me.

434
00:29:42,661 --> 00:29:46,688
All right. Now this
is all sizzle, sizzle, sizzle.

435
00:29:46,932 --> 00:29:48,593
It says "Smooth Criminal."

436
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:55,296
The audience is going wild. The camera
now slowly starts to move over the marquee.

437
00:30:06,218 --> 00:30:07,685
# Ow! #

438
00:30:22,334 --> 00:30:23,665
# As he came into the window #

439
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:26,167
# It was the sound
Of a crescendo #

440
00:30:26,371 --> 00:30:27,804
# He came into her apartment #

441
00:30:28,006 --> 00:30:30,133
# He left the bloodstains
On the carpet #

442
00:30:30,342 --> 00:30:31,741
# She ran underneath the table #

443
00:30:31,977 --> 00:30:34,104
# He could see she was unable #

444
00:30:34,312 --> 00:30:35,677
# So she ran into the bedroom #

445
00:30:35,881 --> 00:30:37,974
# She was struck down
It was her doom #

446
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,139
# Annie, are you okay? #

447
00:30:39,351 --> 00:30:40,648
# So, Annie, are you okay? #

448
00:30:40,852 --> 00:30:41,978
# Are you okay, Annie? #

449
00:30:42,187 --> 00:30:44,519
# Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? #

450
00:30:44,689 --> 00:30:45,883
# Are you okay, Annie? #

451
00:30:46,057 --> 00:30:47,115
# Annie, are you okay? #

452
00:30:47,325 --> 00:30:48,758
# So, Annie, are you okay? #

453
00:30:48,994 --> 00:30:50,859
# Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay? #

454
00:30:51,062 --> 00:30:53,997
# Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie? #

455
00:30:54,199 --> 00:30:57,828
# Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay? #

456
00:30:58,036 --> 00:30:59,526
# There's a sign in the window #

457
00:30:59,738 --> 00:31:01,899
# That he struck you
A crescendo, Annie #

458
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,505
# He came into your apartment #

459
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:05,869
# Left the bloodstains on the carpet #

460
00:31:06,044 --> 00:31:07,272
# Then you ran into the bedroom #

461
00:31:07,512 --> 00:31:09,503
# You were struck down
It was your doom #

462
00:31:09,714 --> 00:31:10,703
# Annie, are you okay? #

463
00:31:10,916 --> 00:31:12,178
# So, Annie, are you okay? #

464
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,646
# Are you okay, Annie? #

465
00:31:13,852 --> 00:31:14,910

00:31:15,153 --> 00:31:16,245

A smooth criminal #

473
00:31:29,234 --> 00:31:31,361
# Ow! #

474
00:31:33,905 --> 00:31:35,167
# So they came into the outway #

475
00:31:35,373 --> 00:31:37,568
# It was Sunday
What a black day #

476
00:31:37,776 --> 00:31:39,175
# Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation #

477
00:31:39,377 --> 00:31:41,242
# Sounding heartbeats
Intimidations #

478
00:31:41,446 --> 00:31:42,538

It was your doom, Annie #

516
00:33:56,448 --> 00:33:57,915
# You've been hit by #

517
00:33:58,116 --> 00:34:00,949
# You've been struck by
A smooth criminal ##

518
00:34:27,612 --> 00:34:29,204
Pretty good.
Pretty good.

519
00:34:39,057 --> 00:34:40,922
# Ah ##

520
00:34:45,263 --> 00:34:46,890
You're gonna put that in?

521
00:34:47,098 --> 00:34:49,430
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

522
00:34:49,634 --> 00:34:52,432
It's really cool
for me as a musical director

523
00:34:52,637 --> 00:34:54,935
because I need the artist
to be hands-on

524
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:58,132
and MJ is always hands-on
with everything that he does.

525
00:34:58,376 --> 00:35:01,106
He knows all of his records.
He knows all of his tempos.

526
00:35:01,312 --> 00:35:02,745
He knows all of his keys
of songs.

527
00:35:02,947 --> 00:35:03,971
# Doo dah ##

528
00:35:04,182 --> 00:35:06,514
No. Just a little drag,
a little bit more behind the beat.

529
00:35:06,751 --> 00:35:08,378
Yeah. It's not
the right sound.

530
00:35:08,586 --> 00:35:10,417
Like you're dragging
yourself out of bed.

531
00:35:10,622 --> 00:35:12,988
Imagine this is the right sound.
Check this.

532
00:35:19,264 --> 00:35:21,255
Don't change so soon, though.

533
00:35:21,466 --> 00:35:23,764
Don't wanna change over so
soon yet. See, you're going:

534
00:35:39,851 --> 00:35:41,546
Don't do that one.
Don't do that one.

535
00:35:41,786 --> 00:35:43,720
Don't do that one yet?
No, no.

536
00:35:43,955 --> 00:35:45,422
It should be simpler.

537
00:35:54,866 --> 00:35:58,063
Uh-huh. Yeah.

538
00:36:00,972 --> 00:36:02,803
We'll get the sound,
we'll get the sound.

539
00:36:03,007 --> 00:36:05,134
We'll get the sound
but that's not till tomorrow.

540
00:36:05,376 --> 00:36:07,640
We gotta do a
sound check tomorrow night.

541
00:36:07,846 --> 00:36:08,938
That's what we need to do.

542
00:36:09,147 --> 00:36:11,240
And don't start
unless you do a sound check.

543
00:36:11,483 --> 00:36:13,212
I know, that's why we doing it.

544
00:36:13,451 --> 00:36:15,078
We need you to do
the sound check

545
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,151
because can't nobody hear
what you need to hear.

546
00:36:17,355 --> 00:36:19,380
Some people might
not wanna have that bass...

547
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:21,684
I want it the way I wrote it.
I mean...

548
00:36:21,893 --> 00:36:23,884
Like the audience hears it.

549
00:36:24,195 --> 00:36:27,028
So whatever the record's doing,
that's how I want it to sound.

550
00:36:27,232 --> 00:36:30,963
That's what it's gonna sound like, but
you gotta get closer to what you want.

551
00:36:31,169 --> 00:36:35,572
Then if you wanna hear a little more
booty on something else, know what I mean?

552
00:36:35,773 --> 00:36:37,365
Only you can say that.
You know what I'm saying?

553
00:36:38,776 --> 00:36:40,175
A little more booty.

554
00:36:40,378 --> 00:36:41,675
That's funny.

555
00:36:42,614 --> 00:36:44,343
But you knew
what I meant though too.

556
00:36:44,516 --> 00:36:45,608
I know exactly what you meant.

557
00:36:45,783 --> 00:36:46,772
Yeah, all right, then.

558
00:36:46,985 --> 00:36:49,078
One more time from the top.

559
00:36:50,889 --> 00:36:54,017
# Ooh-ooh #

560
00:36:54,225 --> 00:36:56,386
# Ooh-ooh #

561
00:36:56,594 --> 00:36:59,358
# Ooh-ooh #

562
00:36:59,564 --> 00:37:02,226
# Ooh-ooh #

563
00:37:02,433 --> 00:37:05,095
# Ooh-ooh #

564
00:37:05,303 --> 00:37:07,533
# Ooh-ooh #

565
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:08,728
Ssh-ssh.

566
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,238
Try to get the same sound.

567
00:37:13,745 --> 00:37:16,373
# Ooh-ooh #

568
00:37:16,581 --> 00:37:19,448
Good sound on that. Good sound.

569
00:37:23,655 --> 00:37:25,282
No, no, not yet, Prince.

570
00:37:25,523 --> 00:37:26,751
No. You gotta...

571
00:37:27,025 --> 00:37:29,323
You gotta let it simmer.

572
00:37:29,561 --> 00:37:31,426
It's got a moment
where it has to simmer.

573
00:37:31,629 --> 00:37:34,063
That's right.
You're not letting it simmer.

574
00:37:34,799 --> 00:37:38,235
Just bathe in the moonlight. You
have to let it simmer a bit, you know?

575
00:37:39,103 --> 00:37:43,164
All right, Prince? We're
gonna add two bars after the "ch-ooh."

576
00:37:43,341 --> 00:37:45,332
Or at least a bar.

577
00:37:46,578 --> 00:37:48,842
Yeah. MJ, check it
from the top again.

578
00:37:49,047 --> 00:37:50,742
See what we got,
simmer-wise.

579
00:37:50,949 --> 00:37:53,175
One, two, three, four.

580
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,848
# Doo-doo #

581
00:37:57,088 --> 00:37:59,750

582

# Pretty baby
With the high heels on #

588
00:38:25,483 --> 00:38:30,819
# You give me fever
Like I've never, never known #

589
00:38:31,022 --> 00:38:37,018
# I feel your fever
From miles around #

590
00:38:37,228 --> 00:38:42,359
# I'll pick you up in my car
And we'll paint the town #

591
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:48,232
# Just kiss me, baby
And tell me twice #

592
00:38:48,473 --> 00:38:52,000
# That you're the one for #

593
00:38:54,879 --> 00:38:57,313
# You make me feel real #

594
00:38:57,515 --> 00:39:00,006

595
00:39:00,218 --> 00:39:02,846

00:39:03,054 --> 00:39:05,614
# Doo-doo #

597
00:39:05,823 --> 00:39:11,125

Whoo! #

598
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:14,264

599
00:39:14,499 --> 00:39:16,729
# Doo-doo #

600
00:39:16,934 --> 00:39:19,198
# Ooh ##

601
00:39:24,042 --> 00:39:25,737
I gotta cue that.
I gotta cue that.

602
00:39:25,943 --> 00:39:28,741
That shouldn't trigger
on its own.

603
00:39:28,913 --> 00:39:31,211
That can't trigger
on its own.

604
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:33,247
I gotta cue that.

605
00:39:34,652 --> 00:39:38,356
So you gotta watch me
for that growl, okay?

606
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:03,169
# I never felt so in love before #

607
00:40:03,381 --> 00:40:07,249
# Promise, baby
You'll love me for evermore #

608
00:40:07,452 --> 00:40:11,479
# I swear I'm keeping you satisfied #

609
00:40:11,723 --> 00:40:13,748
# Cos you're the one for me #

610
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:15,789
# The way you make me feel #

611
00:40:15,993 --> 00:40:17,756
# The way you make me feel #

612
00:40:17,962 --> 00:40:19,953
# You really turn me on #

613
00:40:20,198 --> 00:40:21,995
# You really turn me on #

614
00:40:22,233 --> 00:40:24,667
# You knock me off
Of my feet now #

615
00:40:24,836 --> 00:40:26,303
# You knock me off of my feet #

616
00:40:26,471 --> 00:40:28,439
# C'mon, girl, come on #

617
00:40:28,606 --> 00:40:30,938
# My lonely days are gone #

618
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:35,602
# The way you make me feel #

619
00:40:37,014 --> 00:40:39,209
# You really turn me on #

620
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:41,009
# Whee-hee-hee #

621
00:40:41,252 --> 00:40:43,948
# You knock me off of my feet #

622
00:40:45,723 --> 00:40:48,283
# My lonely days are gone #

# Cha
Cha #

624
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:56,362
# Cha #

625
00:41:07,378 --> 00:41:09,107
# Shoo, shoo #

00:41:09,647 --> 00:41:11,376
# Shoo, shoo, shoo #

627
00:41:11,616 --> 00:41:14,847
# Shoo, shoo, shoo #

628
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,453
# Ohh #

629
00:41:22,994 --> 00:41:26,191
# The way you make me feel #

630
00:41:27,799 --> 00:41:30,267
# You really turn me on #

00:41:31,769 --> 00:41:34,294
# You knock me off of my feet #

# My lonely days are gone #

633
00:41:38,409 --> 00:41:40,309
# Come on, give it to me #

634
00:41:40,511 --> 00:41:42,502
# He-he #

635
00:41:42,713 --> 00:41:44,146
One more time.

636
00:41:44,348 --> 00:41:47,476
# You really turn me on #

637
00:41:47,685 --> 00:41:49,152
That's why we rehearse.

638
00:41:49,353 --> 00:41:52,379
It's okay, it's okay.
Right here on this one.

639
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:54,524
# My lonely days are gone #

640
00:41:54,725 --> 00:41:56,158
# Ooh ##

641
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,351
They wanted us to
take those eight out so...

642
00:41:58,563 --> 00:42:01,054
It's okay, it's okay, no.
It was a little too soon.

643
00:42:01,299 --> 00:42:03,290
Yeah, I agree, Michael.
Yeah.

644
00:42:03,501 --> 00:42:06,368
- I think let's add them back.
- Just leave it.

645
00:42:06,571 --> 00:42:09,540
You don't feel totally
nourished by it, you know?

646
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,436
MJ, we'll also have a fan
there, right there in the center.

647
00:42:12,677 --> 00:42:14,338
I'm trying to hear you.
Say it again?

648
00:42:14,545 --> 00:42:17,514
There'll be a fan, right
there off the stage for you.

649
00:42:17,715 --> 00:42:19,706
Boom, right there.

650
00:42:19,917 --> 00:42:21,817
Okay, watching Michael.

<i>Once again, ladies
and gentlemen, the world's most fabulous group:</i>

665
00:43:34,425 --> 00:43:36,017
<i>The Jackson 5.</i>

666
00:44:09,527 --> 00:44:11,961
Everybody clap your hands.
Come on!

667
00:44:18,235 --> 00:44:20,294
# When I had you to myself #

668
00:44:20,504 --> 00:44:22,472
# I didn't want you around #

669
00:44:25,042 --> 00:44:26,532
# In a crowd #

670
00:44:26,744 --> 00:44:29,338
# But someone picked you
From the bunch #

671
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:34,715
# Take a second look #

672
00:44:37,955 --> 00:44:39,889
# Show you that I love you #

673
00:44:40,825 --> 00:44:42,019
# Let me now #

674
00:44:42,226 --> 00:44:43,716
# Back in your heart #

675
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:47,457
# Blind to let you go #
# Let you go, baby #

676
00:44:47,665 --> 00:44:50,190
# Now since I see you #

677
00:44:50,735 --> 00:44:52,669
# I want you back #
# Yes, I do, now #

00:44:55,072 --> 00:44:56,733

# Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah #

# Na, na, na, na #

00:44:59,176 --> 00:45:00,541
# I want you back ##

682
00:45:00,745 --> 00:45:02,610
You guys, I gotta tell you this.

683
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:06,613
When I'm trying to hear and it feels like
somebody's fist is pushed into my ear,

684
00:45:06,851 --> 00:45:08,785
it's really very difficult.

685
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,783
I know you mean well,
so, but it's...

686
00:45:11,022 --> 00:45:14,685
I'm trying to adjust to the ear,
the inner ears, okay?

687
00:45:14,892 --> 00:45:17,224
With the love,
with the love. L-O-V-E.

688
00:45:17,428 --> 00:45:19,896
Michael.
This is not easy though.

689
00:45:20,097 --> 00:45:22,497
Michael, one more
time. I couldn't hear you, sir.

690
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:26,192
The inner ears are very difficult
for me when you're raised

691
00:45:26,404 --> 00:45:31,239
to use just your real own,
you know, aural... Auditory ears.

692
00:45:31,609 --> 00:45:35,375
Now it feels like somebody's fist,
just their fist, is shoved into your ear.

693
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:38,605
Okay.
I'm trying to hear and I can't.

694
00:45:38,816 --> 00:45:41,307
So I'm adjusting
to the situation.

695
00:45:41,552 --> 00:45:44,248
Right. Michael, is there
anything they can give you now

696
00:45:44,455 --> 00:45:48,619
in your ears to make it better
in terms of volume or mix?

697
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:50,757
Um...

698
00:45:50,961 --> 00:45:52,826
If we could just
bring it down a little bit.

699
00:45:53,064 --> 00:45:55,328
Bring it down a little bit, please.

700
00:45:56,233 --> 00:45:58,793
Anything else, Michael? You
wanna hear more of anything?

701
00:45:59,036 --> 00:46:01,061
You wanna hear more voice,
you wanna hear more...?

702
00:46:01,238 --> 00:46:02,637
- No.
- Okay, Michael,

703
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:06,037
after the next song, if it hasn't adjusted
to your liking, will you please let us know?

704
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:07,575
- For sure.
- Thank you.

705
00:46:07,778 --> 00:46:10,042
Would you like to
pick it up from?

706
00:46:10,247 --> 00:46:12,583
- "Stop! The Love You Save."
- "Stop! The Love You Save."

707
00:46:24,829 --> 00:46:26,319
# Played tag in grade school #

708
00:46:26,564 --> 00:46:27,997
# You wanted to be "it" #

709
00:46:28,199 --> 00:46:30,099
# Now chasing boys was justified #

710
00:46:30,301 --> 00:46:31,859
# Crossed your heart, you quit #

711
00:46:32,103 --> 00:46:35,504
# When we grew up you traded
Your promise for my ring #

712
00:46:35,706 --> 00:46:37,697
# Now just like
Back in grade school #

713
00:46:37,942 --> 00:46:39,569
# You're doing the same old thing #

714
00:46:39,777 --> 00:46:42,371
# Stop!
The love you save may be your own #

715
00:46:42,613 --> 00:46:44,205
# Darling, take it slow #

716
00:46:44,448 --> 00:46:47,076
# Or someday you'll be all alone #

717
00:46:47,284 --> 00:46:49,980
# Stop!
The love you save may be your own #

718
00:46:50,187 --> 00:46:52,712
# Darling, look both ways
Before you cross me #

719
00:46:52,957 --> 00:46:56,017
# You're headed for a danger zone ##

720
00:47:14,478 --> 00:47:16,241
God bless you.

721
00:47:25,656 --> 00:47:30,753
# You and I must make a pact #

722
00:47:30,995 --> 00:47:36,865
# We must bring salvation back #

723
00:47:37,067 --> 00:47:40,833
# Where there is love #

724
00:47:41,038 --> 00:47:47,273
# I'll be there #
# I'll be there #

725
00:47:47,511 --> 00:47:53,074
# I'll reach out my hand to you #

726
00:47:53,284 --> 00:47:58,779
# I'll have faith in all you do #

727
00:47:59,023 --> 00:48:02,789
# Just call my name #

728
00:48:03,027 --> 00:48:06,690
# And I'll be there #
# I'll be there #

729
00:48:06,897 --> 00:48:09,559
# Ohh, yeah #

730
00:48:09,767 --> 00:48:14,170
# I'll be there to comfort you #

731
00:48:14,371 --> 00:48:17,363
# Build my world of dreams
Around you #

732
00:48:17,575 --> 00:48:20,373
# I'm so glad I found you #

733
00:48:20,578 --> 00:48:24,708
# I'll be there
With a love that's strong #

734
00:48:24,915 --> 00:48:27,247
# I'll be your strength #

735
00:48:27,451 --> 00:48:32,081
# I'll keep holding on #

736
00:48:32,289 --> 00:48:35,087
# I love you #

737
00:48:37,428 --> 00:48:42,889
# If you should ever find
Someone new #

738
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:49,300
# I know he'd better be good to you #

739
00:48:49,506 --> 00:48:53,408
# Cos if he doesn't #

740
00:48:53,611 --> 00:48:56,739
# I'll be there #

741
00:48:56,947 --> 00:48:59,245
# Look over your shoulders, honey #

742
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:00,940
# Whoo #

743
00:49:01,151 --> 00:49:04,279
# I'll be there #

744
00:49:04,488 --> 00:49:05,819
Everybody!

745
00:49:06,023 --> 00:49:11,620
# I'll be there #

746
00:49:11,829 --> 00:49:15,629
# Just call my name #

747
00:49:15,833 --> 00:49:18,859
# I'll be there #

748
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:21,333
# Just look over
Your shoulders, honey #

749
00:49:21,538 --> 00:49:23,005
# Ooh #

750
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:28,007
# I'll be there #

751
00:49:28,245 --> 00:49:34,115
# I'll be there #

752
00:49:37,021 --> 00:49:44,359
# There #

753
00:49:45,529 --> 00:49:49,625
I'll say, "Jackie, Jermaine, Marlon,

754
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:53,963
Tito, Randy, I love you.

755
00:49:55,406 --> 00:49:59,001
Joseph and Katherine,
God bless you. I love you."

756
00:50:02,913 --> 00:50:06,872
# And #

757
00:50:09,553 --> 00:50:13,216
Just trying to conserve my
throat, please, so understand.

758
00:50:13,424 --> 00:50:17,554
# I will be #

759
00:50:17,795 --> 00:50:21,356
# I will be #

760
00:50:21,565 --> 00:50:25,661
# I will be #

761
00:50:25,869 --> 00:50:28,064
# I will be #

762
00:50:28,305 --> 00:50:30,205
# Darling, be #

763
00:50:30,407 --> 00:50:36,004
# I will be #

764
00:50:37,414 --> 00:50:40,076
# There #

765
00:50:40,317 --> 00:50:44,413
# Hoo ##

766
00:50:51,962 --> 00:50:54,759
And blackout.
We'll make it cleaner at the back.

767
00:50:54,965 --> 00:50:59,061
So you wanna get rid of the bad
specials, those profiles coming in.

768
00:50:59,269 --> 00:51:01,100
There's a lot going on.
The dancers, you know,

769
00:51:01,338 --> 00:51:03,932
we do maintenance with them,
you know, two to three times a week.

770
00:51:04,141 --> 00:51:07,736
We do Pilates and stretching and
ballet, and they have physical therapy.

771
00:51:07,945 --> 00:51:09,913
You know,
just keeping everybody together.

772
00:51:10,147 --> 00:51:12,445
I saw you, you were
going like this, what is this?

773
00:51:12,649 --> 00:51:13,980
That's Russian. This is Russian.

774
00:51:14,218 --> 00:51:18,621
So Baryshnikov does it like this and
you guys are doing like this. Same thing.

775
00:51:19,123 --> 00:51:20,488
Good.

776
00:51:20,657 --> 00:51:22,147
- One more time.
- Sure.

777
00:51:22,359 --> 00:51:24,259
I mean, but we're straight
up and down now, right?

778
00:51:24,461 --> 00:51:26,986
I don't think it's anything
except hand moving.

779
00:51:27,231 --> 00:51:29,791
I think that's smoother,
you know what I mean?

780
00:51:29,967 --> 00:51:31,093
I mean, I have nothing to move.

781
00:51:33,437 --> 00:51:34,870
Dancers, music.

782
00:51:50,487 --> 00:51:52,751
# Let's dance, let's shout #

783
00:51:52,956 --> 00:51:54,583
# Shake your body
Down to the ground #

784
00:51:54,792 --> 00:51:56,419
# Let's dance, let's shout #

785
00:51:56,627 --> 00:51:58,458
# Shake your body
Down to the ground #

786
00:51:58,662 --> 00:52:00,653
# Let's dance, let's shout #

787
00:52:00,898 --> 00:52:02,695
# Shake your body
Down to the ground #

788
00:52:02,933 --> 00:52:04,662
# Let's dance, let's shout #

789
00:52:04,902 --> 00:52:06,927
# Shake your body
Down to the ground #

790
00:52:21,151 --> 00:52:23,483
# Down, down, down, down #

791
00:52:36,934 --> 00:52:39,232
# Down, down, down, down ##

792
00:52:47,044 --> 00:52:50,377
All right, "I Just Can't Stop
Loving You." Judith.

793
00:52:50,581 --> 00:52:51,843
Let me know
when you're ready.

794
00:52:52,049 --> 00:52:53,983
# A mi amor eres t #

795
00:52:55,452 --> 00:52:58,046
# A mi amor eres t #

796
00:52:58,322 --> 00:53:03,555
# Cuando no estas
No hay quien me d lo que das t #

797
00:53:05,395 --> 00:53:07,989
# A mi amor eres t ##

798
00:53:09,666 --> 00:53:11,896
Do it for Ortega.

799
00:53:12,503 --> 00:53:14,164
Ortega.
Here we go.

800
00:53:14,371 --> 00:53:16,703
For his people.

801
00:53:18,075 --> 00:53:19,599
One, two, three.

802
00:53:21,879 --> 00:53:24,006
More echo in here?

803
00:53:24,214 --> 00:53:28,173
# Ahhh-ah #

804
00:53:30,287 --> 00:53:32,278
# Each time the wind blows #

805
00:53:32,523 --> 00:53:34,889
# I hear your voice so #

806
00:53:35,092 --> 00:53:38,493
# I call your name #

807
00:53:39,596 --> 00:53:41,723
# Whispers at morning #

808
00:53:41,932 --> 00:53:44,526
# Our love is dawning #

809
00:53:44,735 --> 00:53:47,863
# Heaven's glad you came #

810
00:53:48,906 --> 00:53:51,204
# You know how I feel #

811
00:53:51,408 --> 00:53:53,876
# This thing can't go wrong #

812
00:53:54,077 --> 00:53:58,036
# I'm so proud to say I love you #

813
00:53:58,248 --> 00:54:00,716
# Your love's got me high #

814
00:54:00,918 --> 00:54:03,250
# I long to get by #

815
00:54:03,453 --> 00:54:08,550
# My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you #

816
00:54:08,759 --> 00:54:10,659
# I hear your voice now #

817
00:54:10,894 --> 00:54:13,522
# You are my choice now #

818
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:17,598
# The love you bring #

819
00:54:17,801 --> 00:54:20,167
# Heaven's in my heart #

820
00:54:20,404 --> 00:54:23,305
# At your call, I hear harps #

821
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:27,271
# And angels sing #

822
00:54:27,477 --> 00:54:29,604
# You know how I feel #

823
00:54:29,813 --> 00:54:32,145
# This thing can't go wrong #

824
00:54:32,349 --> 00:54:36,581
# I can't live my life without you #

825
00:54:36,787 --> 00:54:39,119
# Your love's got me high #

826
00:54:39,323 --> 00:54:41,314
# I feel we belong #

827
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:46,687
# My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you #

828
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:51,697
# I just can't stop loving you #

829
00:54:51,935 --> 00:54:56,269
# I just can't stop loving you #

830
00:54:56,473 --> 00:54:58,270
# And if I stop #

831
00:54:58,475 --> 00:55:03,276
# Then tell me, just what will I do? #

832
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,814
# I just can't stop loving you #

833
00:55:10,721 --> 00:55:12,848
# At night when the stars shine #

834
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:15,490
# I think in you I'll find #

835
00:55:15,692 --> 00:55:18,183
# A love so true #

836
00:55:18,395 --> 00:55:19,953
# Hey #

837
00:55:20,163 --> 00:55:22,597
# When morning awakes me #

838
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:25,165
# Will you come and take me? #

839
00:55:25,369 --> 00:55:29,601
# I'll wait for you #

840
00:55:29,806 --> 00:55:32,036
# You know how I feel #

841
00:55:32,242 --> 00:55:34,540
# This thing can't go wrong #

842
00:55:34,745 --> 00:55:37,612
# I'm so proud to say I love you #

843
00:55:37,814 --> 00:55:39,247
# I do #

844
00:55:39,483 --> 00:55:41,678
# This thing can't go wrong #

845
00:55:41,885 --> 00:55:43,409
# This feeling's so strong #

846
00:55:43,654 --> 00:55:44,643
# Well #

847
00:55:44,855 --> 00:55:49,155
# My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you #

848
00:55:49,359 --> 00:55:52,419
# I just can't stop loving you #

849
00:55:52,663 --> 00:55:54,130
# Oh, oh, no #

850
00:55:54,331 --> 00:55:58,233
# I just can't stop loving you #

851
00:55:58,435 --> 00:55:59,424
# Said I can't stop #

852
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:00,830
# And if I stop #

853
00:56:01,038 --> 00:56:05,998
# Then tell me, just what will I do? #

854
00:56:06,209 --> 00:56:10,077
# I just can't stop loving you #

855
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:13,613
# We can change
All the world #

856
00:56:13,784 --> 00:56:15,081
# Tomorrow #

857
00:56:15,285 --> 00:56:19,881
# We can sing songs
Of yesterday #

858
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:24,459
# I can say
Hey, farewell to sorrow #

859
00:56:24,695 --> 00:56:26,595
# This is my life and I #

860
00:56:26,797 --> 00:56:29,891
# I want to see you for always #

861
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:32,568
# I just can't stop loving you #

862
00:56:32,769 --> 00:56:34,361
# No, baby #

863
00:56:34,571 --> 00:56:38,598
# I just can't stop loving you #

864
00:56:38,809 --> 00:56:40,037
# Said I can't stop #

865
00:56:40,243 --> 00:56:41,471
# And if I stop #

866
00:56:41,712 --> 00:56:44,909
# Then tell me, just what will I do? #

867
00:56:45,115 --> 00:56:47,174
# What will I do?
No, no #

868
00:56:47,384 --> 00:56:50,251
# I just can't stop loving you #
# He-he-he #

869
00:56:50,454 --> 00:56:52,081
# He-he-he #

870
00:56:52,289 --> 00:56:55,224
# I just can't stop loving you #
# He-he-he #

871
00:56:55,425 --> 00:56:56,619
# Know I do, girl #

872
00:56:56,827 --> 00:56:58,419
# And if I stop #

873
00:56:58,628 --> 00:57:01,597
# Then tell me, just what will I do? #

874
00:57:01,798 --> 00:57:03,766
# Tell me #

875
00:57:03,967 --> 00:57:08,495
# I just can't stop loving you #

876
00:57:08,705 --> 00:57:11,572
# I just can't stop loving you #

877
00:57:11,775 --> 00:57:13,265
# Hey #

878
00:57:13,477 --> 00:57:15,104
# And if I stop #

879
00:57:15,312 --> 00:57:21,251
# Then tell me, just what will I do? #
# Break down #

880
00:57:21,451 --> 00:57:24,318
# Because #

881
00:57:24,521 --> 00:57:26,512
# Because #

882
00:57:26,757 --> 00:57:30,818
# I just can't stop #

883
00:57:31,027 --> 00:57:35,964
# I just can't stop #

884
00:57:36,166 --> 00:57:38,657
# I just can't stop, baby #

885
00:57:38,869 --> 00:57:43,363
# I just can't stop, yeah #

886
00:57:43,607 --> 00:57:46,474
# I can't stop, no, baby #

887
00:57:46,676 --> 00:57:52,012
# I just can't stop, no #

888
00:57:52,249 --> 00:57:54,615
# I just can't stop, no #

889
00:57:54,818 --> 00:57:58,310
# I just can't stop #

890
00:57:58,522 --> 00:58:02,253
# I can't stop, baby #

891
00:58:02,459 --> 00:58:05,360
# I can't stop, no #

892
00:58:05,562 --> 00:58:08,190
# I can't stop, no, baby #

893
00:58:08,398 --> 00:58:10,457
# I can't stop, no #

894
00:58:10,667 --> 00:58:12,328
# Yeah #

895
00:58:12,536 --> 00:58:15,835
# Oh, I just can't stop #

896
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:20,305
# Oh, I just can't stop loving #

897
00:58:20,777 --> 00:58:24,770
# You ##

898
00:58:38,728 --> 00:58:43,358
Now, don't make me sing out
when I shouldn't be singing out.

899
00:58:43,567 --> 00:58:47,901
I'm warming... I'm trying to warm up
my voice for this moment.

900
00:58:48,104 --> 00:58:51,403
Why do you do this to me?
I shouldn't be singing right now.

901
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:56,436
- No. No, no.
- You better sing!

902
00:58:57,681 --> 00:59:00,309
I'm warming up to the moment.

903
00:59:00,517 --> 00:59:02,712
But you just can't help it, MJ.

904
00:59:02,886 --> 00:59:04,877
No, but, I shouldn't. I really shouldn't.

905
00:59:05,088 --> 00:59:07,056
Yeah, but you felt it.
No, no.

906
00:59:07,224 --> 00:59:09,055
But you can allow
yourself that one time.

907
00:59:09,259 --> 00:59:10,726
I can't do that.

908
00:59:10,927 --> 00:59:13,122
But you're fine to do it.
I gotta save my voice.

909
00:59:13,363 --> 00:59:17,060
That ending was just like the
smelliest ending of all the versions.

910
00:59:17,601 --> 00:59:19,432
Band, it's just this.

911
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:22,700
This is what it is.

912
00:59:29,579 --> 00:59:33,140
Whoo. What day is it?
What time is it?

913
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:34,783
We're like, you know...
We're down to the wire.

914
00:59:34,951 --> 00:59:36,543
We're like halfway through
our film shoot

915
00:59:36,753 --> 00:59:40,416
<i>for all of our incredible
new film content for This Is It.</i>

916
00:59:41,291 --> 00:59:46,354
Today we are filming new
segments for "Thriller," 3-D.

917
00:59:52,736 --> 00:59:53,930
Argh!

918
01:00:00,644 --> 01:00:02,578
Do I still have on my 3-D glasses?
Yes, you do.

919
01:00:02,746 --> 01:00:04,077
Oh, good.

920
01:00:04,481 --> 01:00:06,813
I think I look great
in these glasses.

921
01:00:07,384 --> 01:00:08,874
Do I look
as old as I feel?

922
01:00:09,486 --> 01:00:11,579
Guys, please step
away if you're not in the shot.

923
01:00:11,755 --> 01:00:13,416
Photographers, everybody.

924
01:00:13,623 --> 01:00:15,318
Clear the set now for the crew.

925
01:00:15,525 --> 01:00:17,618
- Rolling!
- Here we go.

926
01:00:18,461 --> 01:00:19,485
Action.

927
01:00:22,666 --> 01:00:24,463
This guy should be
getting out soon.

928
01:00:26,102 --> 01:00:27,535
You guys, be aware of the camera.

929
01:00:27,704 --> 01:00:28,693
Look up to it.

930
01:00:28,905 --> 01:00:30,930
There's gonna be light on him,
Michael. There's no light on him now.

931
01:00:31,141 --> 01:00:32,199
Give the information
to him.

932
01:00:32,409 --> 01:00:34,809
Gravedigger, right
into the camera. Put your...

933
01:00:35,011 --> 01:00:38,105
There it is. Right into it, right
in there. That's it, keep going.

934
01:00:38,315 --> 01:00:39,441
- Right there.
- That's it.

935
01:00:39,783 --> 01:00:42,513
Right into the camera. Reach your
hands out in front of you, guys.

936
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:44,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
That's it, beautiful!

937
01:00:44,287 --> 01:00:45,948
Whoo!

938
01:00:46,423 --> 01:00:49,358
Keep coming. Yeah, right
into the lens, in the center.

939
01:00:49,526 --> 01:00:51,494
I'm in the center of the camera.
There you go.

940
01:00:51,995 --> 01:00:57,695
Now, go out. Go out. Good. And cut.
It's brilliant. Thank you, everybody.

941
01:01:04,374 --> 01:01:07,343
We call these the dead
brides and the dead grooms.

942
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:12,307
And there'll be a parade of them
moving through the aisles in "Thriller."

943
01:01:43,279 --> 01:01:46,248
<i>Darkness falls across the land</i>

944
01:01:46,983 --> 01:01:49,884
<i>The midnight hour is close at hand</i>

945
01:01:50,253 --> 01:01:53,416
<i>Creatures crawl in search of blood</i>

946
01:01:53,723 --> 01:01:56,692
<i>To terrorize y'all's neighborhood</i>

947
01:01:57,494 --> 01:02:00,292
<i>And whosoever shall be found</i>

948
01:02:01,765 --> 01:02:03,357
<i>Without the soul for getting down</i>

949
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:07,795
<i>Must stand and face
The hounds of hell</i>

950
01:02:08,038 --> 01:02:11,132
<i>And rot inside a corpse's shell</i>

951
01:02:12,909 --> 01:02:15,434
# It's close to midnight #

952
01:02:15,612 --> 01:02:18,945
# And something evil's
Lurking in the dark #

953
01:02:21,117 --> 01:02:26,714
# Under the moonlight, you see a sight
That almost stops your heart #

954
01:02:26,923 --> 01:02:29,289
# You try to scream #

955
01:02:29,526 --> 01:02:33,428
# But terror
Takes the sound before you make it #

956
01:02:34,931 --> 01:02:37,058
# You start to freeze #

957
01:02:37,267 --> 01:02:40,464
# As horror
Looks you right between the eyes #

958
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:42,763
# You're paralyzed #

959
01:02:42,972 --> 01:02:45,406
# Cos this is thriller #

960
01:02:45,608 --> 01:02:47,235
# Thriller night #

961
01:02:47,444 --> 01:02:50,845
# And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike #

962
01:02:51,081 --> 01:02:53,311
# You know it's thriller #

963
01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:55,450
# Thriller night #

964
01:02:55,652 --> 01:03:02,319
# You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller tonight #

965
01:03:08,998 --> 01:03:11,262
# You hear the door slam #

966
01:03:11,434 --> 01:03:15,996
# And realize there's nowhere
Left to run #

967
01:03:16,806 --> 01:03:22,836
# You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun #

968
01:03:23,079 --> 01:03:25,479
# You close your eyes #

969
01:03:25,648 --> 01:03:29,607
# And hope that this is
Just imagination #

970
01:03:29,819 --> 01:03:30,808
# Girl #

971
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:32,180
# But all the while #

972
01:03:33,223 --> 01:03:36,522
# You hear a creature
Creeping up behind #

973
01:03:36,726 --> 01:03:38,694
# You're out of time #

974
01:03:38,895 --> 01:03:41,329
# Cos this is thriller #

975
01:03:41,531 --> 01:03:43,089
# Thriller night #

976
01:03:43,299 --> 01:03:47,599
# Girl, I can thrill you more
Than any ghost would ever dare try #

977
01:03:47,804 --> 01:03:49,863
# Thriller#
# Whoo-hoo! #

978
01:03:50,106 --> 01:03:51,198
# Thriller night #

01:03:51,407 --> 01:03:55,309
# So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller #

980
01:03:55,512 --> 01:03:57,503
# Ow! #

981
01:04:49,265 --> 01:04:52,393
<i>The demons squeal in sheer delight</i>

982
01:04:52,602 --> 01:04:57,369
<i>It's you they spy, so plump, so right</i>

983
01:04:57,574 --> 01:05:00,475
<i>For though the groove
Is hard to beat</i>

984
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:03,611
<i>Yet still you stand with frozen feet</i>

985
01:05:03,813 --> 01:05:06,805
<i>You try to run, you try to scream</i>

986
01:05:07,984 --> 01:05:10,544
<i>But no more sun you'll ever see</i>

987
01:05:10,753 --> 01:05:13,449
<i>For evil reaches from the crypt</i>

988
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:16,750
<i>To crush you in its icy grip</i>

989
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,394

# So let me hold you tight

995

# Ow! Ow! ##

996
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:53,550
Make sure that there's
somebody waiting for Michael there

997
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:56,492
with a flashlight
and everything. Great.

998
01:07:02,565 --> 01:07:04,328
Whoo!

999
01:07:05,702 --> 01:07:07,397
Yeah!

1000
01:07:09,072 --> 01:07:13,839
Now, you know,
could we do that times 10?

1001
01:07:14,344 --> 01:07:15,436
Absolutely!

1002
01:07:17,013 --> 01:07:21,040
Okay, so next is the fire screen. We're
gonna show you some chase sequences.

1003
01:07:37,633 --> 01:07:39,931
Rock 'n' roll!

1004
01:07:55,084 --> 01:08:00,147
Today was all about testing the
chandelier and bed props for the show

1005
01:08:00,356 --> 01:08:03,223
with our aerialists
and pole-dancing experts.

1006
01:08:03,426 --> 01:08:05,724
It's all about
checking dimension

1007
01:08:05,928 --> 01:08:07,896
and widths and pipe
and how things work together.

1008
01:08:08,097 --> 01:08:09,792
Building props with people on it

1009
01:08:09,999 --> 01:08:12,229
is a big responsibility
and a lot of fun

1010
01:08:12,435 --> 01:08:16,132
because we have to design things
around the human body.

1011
01:08:18,808 --> 01:08:21,641
This is the first time in the history
that we've worked with Michael,

1012
01:08:21,878 --> 01:08:25,814
for the past 25 years, that we
are including lighted elements

1013
01:08:26,015 --> 01:08:27,505
in his "Billie Jean" costume.

1014
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:30,275
The cut of the stones,
the refraction of the light

1015
01:08:30,486 --> 01:08:33,922
as we're applying them, you almost need sunglasses,
just the reflection if you're trying to get them on.

1016
01:08:34,123 --> 01:08:35,818
We're bringing things
into his performance

1017
01:08:36,025 --> 01:08:39,961
where they haven't been developed at all.
And it's just being developed for Michael.

1018
01:08:40,163 --> 01:08:42,256
I'm working with scientists
in the Netherlands,

1019
01:08:42,465 --> 01:08:44,990
I'm working with people in California,
I'm working with Swarovski.

1020
01:08:45,201 --> 01:08:49,103
Always trying to push the boundaries, you
know, because that's what Michael's about.

1021
01:08:51,207 --> 01:08:54,267
Now, is this working this evening?

1022
01:08:54,477 --> 01:08:57,605
Without running the number, I would
just like it, if Michael would like to,

1023
01:08:57,814 --> 01:09:01,341
just to give him a little ride so that
he feels his new cherry picker out.

1024
01:09:01,551 --> 01:09:03,041
From the top of "Beat It."

1025
01:09:03,286 --> 01:09:05,015
Uh, you wanna
do it with music already?

1026
01:09:05,221 --> 01:09:06,279
Yeah.

1027
01:09:06,489 --> 01:09:08,514
Can I just give you a ride first?

1028
01:09:08,724 --> 01:09:10,055
- Sure. If you want.
- Okay.

1029
01:09:10,293 --> 01:09:12,056
Yeah. Just for
safety. Thank you, sir.

1030
01:09:12,228 --> 01:09:13,627
Thank you, Michael.

1031
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:16,355
- Sure. Sure.
- Daredevil MJ.

1032
01:09:16,566 --> 01:09:18,466
- I trust in you.
- Thank you.

1033
01:09:19,936 --> 01:09:21,870
Just for safety. Thank you.

1034
01:09:22,071 --> 01:09:24,164
Stand by, guys.

1035
01:09:26,008 --> 01:09:28,067
You've been there before.

1036
01:09:28,311 --> 01:09:29,573
Whee.

1037
01:09:29,812 --> 01:09:32,679
MJ, this is just at mid-height.

1038
01:09:32,882 --> 01:09:35,646
It goes much higher than this.

1039
01:09:35,852 --> 01:09:38,013
This is the low height.

1040
01:09:38,221 --> 01:09:40,155
Why would you say
that to me? You know better.

1041
01:09:41,724 --> 01:09:43,589
See, why did you say that to him?

1042
01:09:43,826 --> 01:09:45,726
He's teasing me. That's why.

1043
01:09:45,962 --> 01:09:47,088
He know I wants to go higher.

1044
01:09:48,664 --> 01:09:50,689
God bless you, Kenny.

1045
01:09:50,867 --> 01:09:52,198
Hi.

1046
01:09:52,401 --> 01:09:55,768
Yeah, yeah.
Are the fans working on this?

1047
01:09:56,005 --> 01:09:57,267
It's great.

1048
01:09:57,507 --> 01:09:59,065
Michael, please hold on.

1049
01:09:59,275 --> 01:10:02,005
Thank you.
It's very nice.

1050
01:10:02,211 --> 01:10:04,236
Yeah? Is it smooth?
Yeah.

1051
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:08,780
Great. This is monumental,
Michael's back on the cherry picker.

1052
01:10:08,985 --> 01:10:10,976
Yeah.
Thank you.

1053
01:10:11,187 --> 01:10:12,882
We love you, Michael.

1054
01:10:13,055 --> 01:10:14,920
Love you too.

1055
01:10:17,426 --> 01:10:19,087
# Ho! #

1056
01:10:19,295 --> 01:10:20,557
# Ho! #

1057
01:10:20,763 --> 01:10:22,355
# Ho! #

1058
01:10:22,565 --> 01:10:23,896
# Ho! #

1059
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:25,567
# Oh! #
# Oh! #

1060
01:10:25,768 --> 01:10:27,565
# Ho! #
# Ho! #

1061
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:30,136
# Ow! #

1062
01:10:41,617 --> 01:10:44,609
# They told him
Don't you ever come around here #

1063
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:47,812
# Don't wanna see your face
You better disappear #

1064
01:10:48,057 --> 01:10:51,390
# The fire's in their eyes
And their words are really clear #

1065
01:10:51,594 --> 01:10:53,084
# So beat it #

1066
01:10:53,296 --> 01:10:55,287
# Just beat it #
# Huh! #

1067
01:10:55,531 --> 01:10:58,523
# You better run
You better do what you can #

1068
01:10:58,734 --> 01:11:02,101
# Don't wanna see no blood
Don't be a macho man #

1069
01:11:02,305 --> 01:11:05,274
# You wanna be tough
Better do what you can #

1070
01:11:05,474 --> 01:11:07,032
# So beat it #

1071
01:11:07,243 --> 01:11:08,801
# But you wanna be bad #

1072
01:11:09,045 --> 01:11:11,070
# Just beat it #
# Beat it #

1073
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:12,542
# Beat it #
# Beat it #

1074
01:11:12,748 --> 01:11:15,945
# No one wants to be defeated #

1075
01:11:16,152 --> 01:11:19,485
# Showin' how funky
And strong is your fight #

1076
01:11:19,689 --> 01:11:22,783
# It doesn't matter
Who's wrong or right #

1077
01:11:22,992 --> 01:11:24,960
# Just beat it #
# Beat it #

1078
01:11:25,161 --> 01:11:26,651
# Beat it #

01:11:26,829 --> 01:11:28,262
# Just beat it #

01:11:28,431 --> 01:11:29,489
# Beat it #
# Beat it #

1081
01:11:29,665 --> 01:11:31,098
# Whoo! #

1082
01:11:33,002 --> 01:11:34,833
# Beat it, beat it #

1083
01:11:39,442 --> 01:11:42,002
# Beat it, beat it, beat it #

1084
01:11:43,079 --> 01:11:44,444
# Beat it #

1085
01:12:26,155 --> 01:12:27,645
# Beat it #
# Beat it #

1086
01:12:27,857 --> 01:12:29,256
# Beat it #
# Beat it #

1087
01:12:29,492 --> 01:12:32,393
# No one wants to be defeated #

1088
01:12:32,628 --> 01:12:36,189
# Showin' how funky
And strong is your fight #

1089
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:39,368
# It doesn't matter
Who's wrong or right #

1090
01:12:39,568 --> 01:12:41,536
# Just beat it #
# Beat it #

1091
01:12:41,737 --> 01:12:43,261
# Beat it #
# Beat it #

1092
01:12:43,506 --> 01:12:46,407
# No one wants to be defeated #

1093
01:12:46,642 --> 01:12:50,169

1094
01:12:50,379 --> 01:12:54,247
# It doesn't matter
Who's wrong or right #

1095
01:12:57,286 --> 01:12:59,151
# Ho! #

1096
01:12:59,355 --> 01:13:00,754
# Ho! #

1097
01:13:00,956 --> 01:13:02,685
# Ho! #

1098
01:13:02,892 --> 01:13:04,860
# Ho! #

1099
01:13:32,621 --> 01:13:33,883
# Beat it #
# Beat it #

1100
01:13:34,056 --> 01:13:35,421
# Beat it #
# Beat it #

1101
01:13:35,591 --> 01:13:38,754
# No one wants to be defeated #

1102
01:13:38,961 --> 01:13:42,124
# Showin' how funky
And strong is your fight #

1103
01:13:42,331 --> 01:13:45,459
# It doesn't matter
Who's wrong or right #

1104
01:13:45,701 --> 01:13:47,760
# Just beat it #
# Beat it #

1105
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:49,403
# Beat it #
# Beat it #

1106
01:13:49,605 --> 01:13:52,631
# No one wants to be defeated #

1107
01:13:52,842 --> 01:13:56,278
# Showin' how funky
And strong is your fight #

1108
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:59,573
# It doesn't matter
Who's wrong or right #

1109
01:13:59,782 --> 01:14:00,976
# Just #

1110
01:14:01,217 --> 01:14:03,515
# Beat it
Beat it #

1111
01:14:03,753 --> 01:14:06,722
# No one wants to be defeated #

1112
01:14:06,922 --> 01:14:10,153
# Showin' how funky
And strong is your fight #

1113
01:14:10,359 --> 01:14:13,294
# It doesn't matter
Who's wrong or right #

1114
01:14:13,496 --> 01:14:14,929
# Just #

1115
01:14:15,131 --> 01:14:17,326
# Beat it
Beat it #

1116
01:14:17,533 --> 01:14:20,661
# No one wants to be defeated #

1117
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:24,135
# Showin' how funky
And strong is your fight #

1118
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:28,003
# It doesn't matter
Who's wrong or right ##

1119
01:15:08,884 --> 01:15:11,819
Okay, that's where
you want it? When we come up...

1120
01:15:12,054 --> 01:15:13,419
What we're doing is...

1121
01:15:13,656 --> 01:15:15,283
We're doing it for the height.

1122
01:15:16,091 --> 01:15:17,683
I'm gonna take off the jacket

1123
01:15:17,893 --> 01:15:21,385
and kick it, and beat it, and beat it
and we're gonna burn it.

1124
01:15:22,064 --> 01:15:24,396
The jacket's gonna be too hot.
It's gonna be on fire.

1125
01:15:24,567 --> 01:15:26,000
I just wanted to
know when that last one was.

1126
01:15:26,168 --> 01:15:29,001
That's the one, I was pointing to it.

1127
01:15:31,507 --> 01:15:33,441
I was pointing that to you.

1128
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:37,543
I got you.
You don't have to do it again.

1129
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:39,711
We can. Do it again.

1130
01:15:39,915 --> 01:15:42,110
Here it is right
here, just do me the last one.

1131
01:15:42,518 --> 01:15:44,452
Come on the one before it.

1132
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:46,417
Let's go on to C. One before.

1133
01:15:47,923 --> 01:15:50,016
Whoo!

1134
01:16:33,402 --> 01:16:36,098
And let it burn, and the lights out!

1135
01:16:36,472 --> 01:16:37,939
Lights out.

1136
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:40,301
Lights out! Let it burn!

1137
01:16:40,476 --> 01:16:42,603
We're on a 10-minute break.

1138
01:16:44,013 --> 01:16:46,243
I'm just so happy.
This is a dream come true.

1139
01:16:46,448 --> 01:16:49,884
When MJ comes in the room
to rehearse with us, he, um...

1140
01:16:50,085 --> 01:16:54,818
It's just... His presence is just amazing.
It's pretty, pretty cool. Really, really cool.

1141
01:16:59,261 --> 01:17:00,785
Thank you.

1142
01:17:00,996 --> 01:17:06,332
Michael is the epitome of one of
the great entertainers of our time.

1143
01:17:06,535 --> 01:17:09,800
Performing with Michael
has just been a thrill.

1144
01:17:10,005 --> 01:17:13,839
You know, I've been, like, a Michael
Jackson fan since he was 8 years old.

1145
01:17:14,043 --> 01:17:17,342
It's like a lifelong dream for me
to actually work with Michael.

1146
01:17:17,546 --> 01:17:20,106
I've worked with
a lot of great, great artists,

1147
01:17:20,316 --> 01:17:22,648
but, you know, I consider this,
like, really a pinnacle.

1148
01:17:22,851 --> 01:17:24,443
Michael's a perfectionist.

1149
01:17:24,653 --> 01:17:28,180
And you don't really find that in
pop musicians. You can't fool Michael.

1150
01:17:28,424 --> 01:17:30,187
You have to come in
knowing the record.

1151
01:17:30,426 --> 01:17:34,556
And then, hopefully, finding a middle ground
to embellish it to make it even better.

1152
01:17:34,797 --> 01:17:37,163
He's just an icon of performance.

1153
01:17:37,366 --> 01:17:41,564
His talent runs so deep in creativity.
And he draws from a deeper emotion

1154
01:17:41,804 --> 01:17:44,136
than anybody else
I've ever seen or worked with.

1155
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:46,831
Right here, right here, right here.

1156
01:17:47,042 --> 01:17:50,478
Okay, no second verse.
Sorry. Okay, sorry, sorry.

1157
01:17:51,213 --> 01:17:54,580
That was a mistake, there is no second
verse. Sorry about that, you guys.

1158
01:17:54,817 --> 01:17:58,014
First verse, oooh, then right
to the bridge, okay?

1159
01:17:58,220 --> 01:18:00,381
- Let's do it one more time.
- Sure.

1160
01:18:00,556 --> 01:18:02,148
Wanna go down then come back up?
One more time.

1161
01:18:02,324 --> 01:18:04,656
Yeah. This is why
we have rehearsal.

1162
01:18:04,827 --> 01:18:06,089
There you go.

1163
01:18:28,017 --> 01:18:31,612
# I took my baby
On a Saturday bang #

1164
01:18:31,854 --> 01:18:33,287
# Boy, is that girl with you? #

1165
01:18:33,522 --> 01:18:35,422
# Yes, we're one and the same #

1166
01:18:35,624 --> 01:18:37,421
# Now I believe in miracles #

1167
01:18:37,626 --> 01:18:40,993
# And a miracle
Has happened tonight #

1168
01:18:41,196 --> 01:18:43,096
# Ooh #

1169
01:18:44,099 --> 01:18:45,862
# But if you're thinkin'
About my baby #

1170
01:18:46,068 --> 01:18:49,526
# It don't matter
If you're black or white #

1171
01:19:00,949 --> 01:19:03,008
So we'll run this way.

1172
01:19:04,286 --> 01:19:06,049
# I am tired of this devil #

1173
01:19:06,255 --> 01:19:08,246
# I am tired of this stuff #

1174
01:19:08,457 --> 01:19:10,084
# I am tired of this business #

1175
01:19:10,292 --> 01:19:12,317
# So when the going gets rough #

1176
01:19:12,561 --> 01:19:14,290
# I ain't scared of your brother #

1177
01:19:14,530 --> 01:19:16,464
# I ain't scared of no sheets #

1178
01:19:16,665 --> 01:19:18,428
# I ain't scared of nobody #

1179
01:19:18,634 --> 01:19:20,795
# Girl, when the goin' gets mean #

1180
01:19:22,671 --> 01:19:24,798
# Protection
For gangs, clubs, and nations #

1181
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,598
# Causing grief in human relations #

1182
01:19:26,809 --> 01:19:28,538
# It's a turf war on a global scale #

1183
01:19:28,744 --> 01:19:30,336
# I'd rather hear
Both sides of the tale #

1184
01:19:30,579 --> 01:19:32,410
# See, it's not about races
Just places #

1185
01:19:32,614 --> 01:19:33,603
# Faces #

1186
01:19:33,816 --> 01:19:35,579
# Where your blood comes from
Is where your space is #

1187
01:19:35,751 --> 01:19:36,809
# I've seen the sharp get duller #

1188
01:19:36,985 --> 01:19:39,180
# I'm not gonna spend my life
Being a color #

1189
01:19:39,421 --> 01:19:40,683
# Did you agree with me #

1190
01:19:40,923 --> 01:19:44,290
# When I saw you
Kicking dirt in my eye? #

1191
01:19:45,828 --> 01:19:48,490
# But if you're thinkin'
About my baby #

1192
01:19:48,697 --> 01:19:52,064
# It don't matter
If you're black or white #

1193
01:19:54,303 --> 01:19:56,567
# I said if you're thinkin'
About my baby #

1194
01:19:56,772 --> 01:20:00,105
# It don't matter
If you're black or white #

1195
01:20:03,512 --> 01:20:07,972
# If you're thinkin' of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white #

1196
01:20:08,183 --> 01:20:09,673
# Hoo! #

1197
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:13,020
# All right #

1198
01:20:14,790 --> 01:20:16,781
# Ooh-hoo #

1199
01:20:17,326 --> 01:20:18,384
# All right #

1200
01:20:18,627 --> 01:20:20,151
# Yeah, yeah, yeah #

1201
01:20:20,362 --> 01:20:22,353
# All right #

1202
01:20:23,599 --> 01:20:25,624
# It's black, it's white #

1203
01:20:25,834 --> 01:20:27,699
# It's tough for them to get by #

1204
01:20:27,903 --> 01:20:30,804
# It's black, it's white, whoo #

1205
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:33,403
# It's black, it's white #

1206
01:20:33,642 --> 01:20:35,735
# It's tough for them to get by #

1207
01:20:35,978 --> 01:20:39,675
# It's black, it's white, whoo ##

1208
01:20:55,397 --> 01:20:59,163
When they stop, you have to just
keep... Just hit your highest note.

1209
01:21:01,403 --> 01:21:02,665
It's time for you to shine.

1210
01:21:06,542 --> 01:21:09,033
And hit a high, long one.

1211
01:21:10,546 --> 01:21:12,207
I mean, way up there.

1212
01:21:13,148 --> 01:21:14,945
It's your time to shine.

1213
01:21:15,684 --> 01:21:17,709
We'll be right there with you.

1214
01:21:28,964 --> 01:21:33,298
It's remarkable, it's some genius stuff
going on over here, man.

1215
01:21:34,870 --> 01:21:36,394
He is the king.

1216
01:21:36,705 --> 01:21:39,196
And he's a good guy too.
He's real humble.

1217
01:21:39,408 --> 01:21:41,273
You know.
And he knows his music.

1218
01:21:41,476 --> 01:21:45,105
What more can you ask for? Because
I'm searching for that flavor too.

1219
01:23:05,627 --> 01:23:08,960
Look at that.
I think it's beautiful.

1220
01:23:09,464 --> 01:23:11,159
Show him
the second one.

1221
01:23:11,366 --> 01:23:13,800
It'll come rolling out at us, right?
Yes.

1222
01:23:14,002 --> 01:23:16,493
And all golden. Look at this one.
It'll be floating so much.

1223
01:23:16,705 --> 01:23:18,036
I love her. I love the light.

1224
01:23:18,273 --> 01:23:20,673
- God, and the lighting's great.
- Yeah. You got it.

1225
01:23:30,052 --> 01:23:33,078
<i>I respect
the secrets and magic of nature.</i>

1226
01:23:33,355 --> 01:23:37,553
<i>That's why it makes me so angry when
I see these things that are happening,</i>

1227
01:23:37,793 --> 01:23:42,321
<i>that every second, I hear, the size of a
football field is torn down in the Amazon.</i>

1228
01:23:42,531 --> 01:23:44,931
<i>I mean, that kind of stuff
really bothers me.</i>

1229
01:23:45,167 --> 01:23:47,692
<i>That's why I write these
kinds of songs, you know.</i>

1230
01:23:47,903 --> 01:23:51,805
<i>It gives some sense of awareness
and awakening and hope to people.</i>

1231
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:54,401
<i>I love the planet.</i>

1232
01:23:54,609 --> 01:23:59,740
<i>I love trees. I have this thing for trees
and the colors and changing of leaves.</i>

1233
01:23:59,948 --> 01:24:04,078
<i>I love it.
And I respect those kind of things.</i>

1234
01:24:54,102 --> 01:24:57,299
# What about sunrise? #

1235
01:24:57,506 --> 01:25:00,873
# What about rain? #

1236
01:25:01,076 --> 01:25:06,639

# Look what we've done #

1250
01:26:09,444 --> 01:26:16,247
# What about all the peace
That you pledge your only son? #

1251
01:26:16,485 --> 01:26:19,716
# What about flowering fields? #

1252

Stop to notice #

1255
01:26:32,367 --> 01:26:35,336
# All the children
Dead from war? #

1256
01:26:35,537 --> 01:26:38,665
# Did you ever stop to notice #

1257
01:26:38,874 --> 01:26:42,037

01:27:13,141 --> 01:27:17,009

1264
01:27:17,212 --> 01:27:19,874
# Now I don't know where we are #

1265
01:27:20,081 --> 01:27:22,106

# What about yesterday? #

1276
01:28:21,643 --> 01:28:22,871
# What about us? #

1277
01:28:23,111 --> 01:28:24,772
# What about those lions? #

1278
01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:26,345
# What about us? #

1279
01:28:26,581 --> 01:28:28,105
# What about yesterday? #

1280
01:28:28,316 --> 01:28:29,442
# What about us? #

1281
01:28:29,651 --> 01:28:31,642
# What about those lions? #

1282
01:28:31,853 --> 01:28:32,979
# What about us? #

1283
01:28:33,188 --> 01:28:35,213
# What about everything? #

1284
01:28:35,457 --> 01:28:36,719
# What about us? #

1285
01:28:36,958 --> 01:28:38,619
# I can't even breathe #

1286
01:28:38,827 --> 01:28:39,987

01:28:40,195 --> 01:28:43,596

# What about everything? #

1291
01:28:49,004 --> 01:28:50,096
# What about us? #

1292
01:28:50,305 --> 01:28:52,239
# Deep within our skin #

1293
01:28:52,474 --> 01:28:53,668
# What about us? #

1294
01:28:53,842 --> 01:28:55,673
# What about you and me? #

1295
01:28:55,844 --> 01:28:56,833
# What about us? #

1296
01:28:57,045 --> 01:28:58,979
# What about my fear? #

1297
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:00,545
# What about us? #

1298
01:29:00,749 --> 01:29:02,410
# What about everything? #

1299
01:29:02,651 --> 01:29:03,879
# What about us? #

1300
01:29:04,119 --> 01:29:05,746
# I can hear them sigh #

1301
01:29:05,987 --> 01:29:07,215
# What about us? #

1302
01:29:07,422 --> 01:29:10,755
# What about everything? #

1303
01:29:10,992 --> 01:29:12,653
# What about the man? #

1304
01:29:12,861 --> 01:29:14,328
# What about us? #

1305
01:29:14,529 --> 01:29:16,053
# What about everything? #

1306
01:29:16,264 --> 01:29:17,697
# What about us? #

1307
01:29:17,899 --> 01:29:19,764
# What about the man? #

1308
01:29:20,001 --> 01:29:20,990
# What about us? #

1309
01:29:21,202 --> 01:29:23,067
# What about everything? #

1310
01:29:23,271 --> 01:29:24,670
# What about us? #

1311
01:29:24,873 --> 01:29:26,238
# Deep within our skin #

1312
01:29:26,441 --> 01:29:27,840
# What about us? #

1313
01:29:28,043 --> 01:29:29,704
# What about all the trees? #

1314
01:29:29,911 --> 01:29:31,242
# What about us? #

1315
01:29:31,446 --> 01:29:33,175
# What about the dream? #

1316
01:29:33,381 --> 01:29:34,439
# What about us? #

1317
01:29:34,683 --> 01:29:37,675
# What about everything? #

1318
01:29:38,286 --> 01:29:41,084
# What about death? #

1319
01:29:41,289 --> 01:29:47,091
# Aaah #

1320
01:29:47,295 --> 01:29:54,098
# Ooh-hoo-oo-oo-oo-ooh ooh ooh #

1321
01:29:54,302 --> 01:29:59,968
# A-aha-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh aah aah #

1322
01:30:00,575 --> 01:30:08,482
# Ooh-hoo-oo-oo-oo-ooh ooh ooh ##

1323
01:30:29,904 --> 01:30:31,997
The value would be greater,

1324
01:30:32,240 --> 01:30:34,208
you let it rumble,

1325
01:30:34,409 --> 01:30:37,776
let it stay open,
let it close in silence.

1326
01:30:40,982 --> 01:30:43,712
And when that door opens,
you start that piano.

1327
01:30:43,918 --> 01:30:45,283
# Da-da da-da-da ##

1328
01:30:49,924 --> 01:30:51,357
God bless you.

1329
01:30:51,593 --> 01:30:54,118
<i>I really
feel that nature is trying so hard</i>

1330
01:30:54,329 --> 01:30:58,663
<i>to compensate for man's
mismanagement of the planet.</i>

1331
01:30:58,867 --> 01:31:02,325
<i>Because the planet is sick.
Like a fever.</i>

1332
01:31:02,537 --> 01:31:05,734
<i>If we don't fix it now,
it's at the point of no return.</i>

1333
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:09,432
<i>This is our last chance
to fix this problem that we have,</i>

1334
01:31:09,677 --> 01:31:11,838
<i>where it's like a runaway train</i>

1335
01:31:12,046 --> 01:31:14,310
<i>and the time has come.
This is it.</i>

1336
01:31:14,516 --> 01:31:16,484
I love you.

1337
01:31:16,684 --> 01:31:19,949
That'll be the ending
of this under the words.

1338
01:31:20,155 --> 01:31:22,646
# Oooh ##

1339
01:31:23,792 --> 01:31:27,353
<i>People are always saying,
"They'll take care of it. The government'll...</i>

1340
01:31:27,562 --> 01:31:31,965
<i>Don't worry. They'll..."
"They" who? It starts with us. It's us.</i>

1341
01:31:32,167 --> 01:31:34,567
<i>Or else it'll never be done.</i>

1342
01:31:38,473 --> 01:31:41,169
Guys, can I have
the lighting crew?

1343
01:31:41,376 --> 01:31:43,401
- Travis?
- Yeah!

1344
01:31:43,845 --> 01:31:46,405
First of all, Michael will be
coming on from offstage,

1345
01:31:46,648 --> 01:31:48,775
and he's got, like,
an attach case.

1346
01:31:48,983 --> 01:31:52,146
And right here, Michael,
you call it here.

1347
01:31:53,221 --> 01:31:56,657
So now it comes here. So it's a
light that is moving on his command.

1348
01:31:56,858 --> 01:31:59,486
Absolutely.
Right? Then when he moves forward,

1349
01:31:59,694 --> 01:32:01,161
he's in that light.

1350
01:32:01,329 --> 01:32:02,728
Yeah.
He's in that light.

1351
01:32:02,931 --> 01:32:05,923
But I wanna be able to step
into the pool once I'm fully dressed.

1352
01:32:06,167 --> 01:32:09,500
So that... So after he does this...
Why don't you do this, Michael?

1353
01:32:09,704 --> 01:32:12,070
After you go like this
and you send that down,

1354
01:32:12,307 --> 01:32:14,605
a gesture and a pool of light
comes on.

1355
01:32:14,843 --> 01:32:17,209
Now a pool of light comes on
down here,

1356
01:32:17,378 --> 01:32:20,108
...wherever his light is,
- Mm-hm. Yeah.

1357
01:32:20,348 --> 01:32:25,911
And the pool of light comes on and
now he'll walk into it, center stage.

1358
01:32:28,189 --> 01:32:29,747
And now he'll start.

1359
01:32:58,486 --> 01:33:00,784
# She was more
Like a beauty queen #

1360
01:33:00,989 --> 01:33:02,786
# From a movie scene #

1361
01:33:02,991 --> 01:33:05,050
# I said don't mind
But what do you mean #

1362
01:33:05,260 --> 01:33:07,854
# I am the one #

1363
01:33:08,062 --> 01:33:12,123
# Who will dance on the floor
In the round? #

1364
01:33:13,101 --> 01:33:16,002
# She said I am the one #

1365
01:33:16,237 --> 01:33:20,139
# Who will dance on the floor
In the round #

1366
01:33:23,378 --> 01:33:25,676
# She told me her name
Was Billie Jean #

1367
01:33:25,914 --> 01:33:27,745
# As she caused a scene #

1368
01:33:27,949 --> 01:33:32,648
# Then every head turned with eyes
That dreamed of being the one #

1369
01:33:32,887 --> 01:33:36,880
# Who will dance on the floor
In the round #

1370
01:33:39,594 --> 01:33:41,186
# People always told me #

1371
01:33:41,429 --> 01:33:43,260
# Be careful of what you do #

1372
01:33:43,464 --> 01:33:46,194
# And don't go around
Breaking young girls' hearts #

1373
01:33:46,434 --> 01:33:47,594
# Hee #

1374
01:33:47,802 --> 01:33:49,770
# And Mother always told me #

1375
01:33:49,971 --> 01:33:51,438
# Be careful who you love #

1376
01:33:51,639 --> 01:33:54,267
# And be careful of what you do #

1377
01:33:54,976 --> 01:33:56,204
# Hey, hey, yeah #

1378
01:33:56,444 --> 01:34:00,175
# Billie Jean is not my lover #

1379
01:34:00,415 --> 01:34:06,012
# She's just a girl
Who says that I am the one #

1380
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:09,189
# But the kid is not my son #

1381
01:34:09,424 --> 01:34:10,857
# Whoo #

1382
01:34:11,059 --> 01:34:13,960
# She says I am the one #

1383
01:34:14,162 --> 01:34:18,189
# But the kid is not my son #

1384
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:30,739
# She was...
Moving on and on all the time #

1385
01:34:30,979 --> 01:34:34,142
# Cos we danced on the floor
In the round #

1386
01:34:35,950 --> 01:34:38,441
# So take my strong advice #

1387
01:34:38,653 --> 01:34:43,249
# Just remember
To always think twice #

1388
01:34:44,225 --> 01:34:45,886
# Do think twice #
# Whoo! #

1389
01:34:46,094 --> 01:34:48,460
# She told my baby
We'd danced till 3 #

1390
01:34:48,663 --> 01:34:50,028
# Then she looked at me #

1391
01:34:50,231 --> 01:34:52,563
# Then showed a photo
My baby cried #

1392
01:34:52,767 --> 01:34:54,860
# His eyes were like mine #

1393
01:34:55,603 --> 01:34:59,562
# Gonna dance on the floor
In the round #

1394
01:35:02,343 --> 01:35:04,004
# People always told me #

1395
01:35:04,212 --> 01:35:06,009
# Be careful what you do #

1396
01:35:06,214 --> 01:35:09,479
# And don't go around
Breaking young girls' hearts #

1397
01:35:10,485 --> 01:35:12,214
# She came
And stood right by me #

1398
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:14,388
# Then the smell
Of sweet perfume #

1399
01:35:14,589 --> 01:35:16,887
# This happened
Much too soon #

1400
01:35:18,226 --> 01:35:19,284
# Hey, hey, yeah #

1401
01:35:19,527 --> 01:35:22,985
# Billie Jean is not my lover #

1402
01:35:23,197 --> 01:35:24,687
# She's just a girl #

1403
01:35:24,866 --> 01:35:28,063
# Who claims that I am the one #

1404
01:35:28,269 --> 01:35:31,864
# But the kid is not my son #

1405
01:35:32,073 --> 01:35:33,802
# He ain't that, no #

1406
01:35:34,042 --> 01:35:35,907
# No, no, he ain't that, no #

1407
01:35:36,110 --> 01:35:39,705
# Billie Jean is not my lover #

1408
01:35:39,914 --> 01:35:44,283
# She's just a girl
Who claims that I am the one #

1409
01:35:45,053 --> 01:35:48,955
# But the kid is not my son #

1410
01:35:50,758 --> 01:35:52,157
# She says I am the one #

1411
01:35:52,393 --> 01:35:53,451
# Oh, baby #

1412
01:35:53,661 --> 01:35:57,062
# But the kid is not my son #

1413
01:35:58,666 --> 01:36:00,827
# Hee-hee-hee #

1414
01:36:01,903 --> 01:36:03,598
# Hey! #

1415
01:36:03,805 --> 01:36:05,295
# Whoo! #

1416
01:36:15,083 --> 01:36:18,052
# She says I am the one #

1417
01:36:27,662 --> 01:36:30,290
# She says I am the one #

1418
01:36:30,498 --> 01:36:33,956
# But the kid is not my son #

1419
01:36:34,168 --> 01:36:36,068
# He ain't that, no #

1420
01:36:36,270 --> 01:36:37,965
# Whoo! #

1421
01:36:38,172 --> 01:36:41,664
# Billie Jean is not my lover #

1422
01:36:41,876 --> 01:36:45,869
# She's just a girl
Who says that I am the one #

1423
01:36:46,114 --> 01:36:47,513
# Oh, baby, baby #

1424
01:36:47,715 --> 01:36:50,149
# But the kid is not my son #

1425
01:36:50,351 --> 01:36:52,148
# No, no, no #

1426
01:36:52,353 --> 01:36:55,288
# She says I am the one #

1427
01:36:55,490 --> 01:36:59,449
# But the kid is not my son #

1428
01:37:00,862 --> 01:37:03,387
# She says I am the one #

1429
01:37:04,665 --> 01:37:06,599
# She says he is my son #

1430
01:37:06,801 --> 01:37:08,462
# Breaking my heart now! #

1431
01:37:08,669 --> 01:37:10,967
# She says I am the one #

1432
01:37:11,172 --> 01:37:14,903
# Billie Jean is not my lover #

1433
01:37:15,143 --> 01:37:19,011
# Billie Jean is not my lover #

1434
01:37:19,213 --> 01:37:23,149
# Billie Jean is not my lover #

1435
01:37:23,351 --> 01:37:27,344
# Billie Jean is not my lover #

1436
01:37:27,555 --> 01:37:31,321
# Billie Jean is not my lover #

1437
01:37:31,526 --> 01:37:35,485
# Billie Jean is not my lover #

1438
01:37:35,696 --> 01:37:39,655
# Billie Jean is not my lover #
# Whoo! #

1439
01:37:39,867 --> 01:37:43,701
# Billie Jean is not my lover #

1440
01:37:51,512 --> 01:37:53,412
# Ah-cha! #

1441
01:37:55,683 --> 01:37:57,378
# Ah-cha! #

1442
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:01,654
# Ah-cha! #

1443
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:21,065
# Whoo! #

1444
01:38:27,381 --> 01:38:29,440
Ho, ho, ho!

1445
01:38:34,455 --> 01:38:36,389
Oh! Oh!

1446
01:38:43,464 --> 01:38:46,456
# Billie Jean is not my lover ##

1447
01:38:48,936 --> 01:38:50,494
I know.

1448
01:38:50,771 --> 01:38:53,433
At least we get a feel of it.

1449
01:38:54,308 --> 01:38:55,775
God bless you.

1450
01:39:06,087 --> 01:39:07,782
Church.

1451
01:39:08,656 --> 01:39:11,318
The church
of rock and roll.

1452
01:39:13,261 --> 01:39:14,285
I'm a fan.

1453
01:39:14,495 --> 01:39:15,723
God bless you.

1454
01:39:15,930 --> 01:39:17,522
Get some water.

1455
01:39:17,765 --> 01:39:19,596
# Water, water ##

1456
01:39:21,836 --> 01:39:24,999
I just wanna say as Michael's
creative partner in this venture,

1457
01:39:25,239 --> 01:39:29,869
this has been one of the most extraordinary
experiences of my creative life.

1458
01:39:30,044 --> 01:39:32,444
I am so proud and so thrilled
and so excited,

1459
01:39:32,647 --> 01:39:35,639
and I just wanna thank everybody
for their extraordinary work.

1460
01:39:35,850 --> 01:39:39,149
And I'm gonna just give this
to Michael now.

1461
01:39:40,054 --> 01:39:41,783
Everybody's doing a great job.

1462
01:39:41,989 --> 01:39:46,358
Let's continue
and believe and have faith.

1463
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:51,691
Give me your all, your endurance,
your patience, and your understanding.

1464
01:39:51,899 --> 01:39:55,562
But it's an adventure,
it's a great adventure.

1465
01:39:55,803 --> 01:39:57,668
It's nothing to be nervous about.

1466
01:39:57,872 --> 01:40:01,035
They just want wonderful
experiences, they want escapism.

1467
01:40:01,275 --> 01:40:04,005
We wanna take them places
that they've never been before.

1468
01:40:04,211 --> 01:40:06,975
We wanna show them talent
like they've never seen before.

1469
01:40:07,181 --> 01:40:08,580
So give your all.

1470
01:40:08,816 --> 01:40:10,647
And I love you all.
And we're a family.

1471
01:40:10,818 --> 01:40:12,183
Just know that.
We're a family.

1472
01:40:12,386 --> 01:40:13,648
That's right.
Amen.

1473
01:40:13,854 --> 01:40:19,349
We're putting love back into the world to
remind the world that love is important.

1474
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:22,996
Love is important. To love each other.
We're all one. That's the message.

1475
01:40:23,197 --> 01:40:24,789
And take care of the planet.

1476
01:40:24,999 --> 01:40:29,402
We have four years to get it right or else
it's irreversible, the damage we've done.

1477
01:40:29,603 --> 01:40:32,504
So we have an important
message to give.

1478
01:40:32,673 --> 01:40:34,106
Okay? It's important.

1479
01:40:34,308 --> 01:40:38,574
But I thank you for your cooperation
so far. Thank you. Big thank you.

1480
01:40:40,715 --> 01:40:43,081
Blessings! Blessings to all.

1481
01:40:43,317 --> 01:40:45,808
Michael Jackson!

1482
01:40:54,462 --> 01:40:55,759
Have a beautiful Sunday.

1483
01:40:55,963 --> 01:40:58,693
Be safe. Stay healthy.
Energy!

1484
01:41:07,341 --> 01:41:09,702
On three! On three, "Michael."

1485
01:41:09,910 --> 01:41:11,343
One, two, three!

1486
01:41:11,545 --> 01:41:14,070
Michael!

1487
01:41:16,884 --> 01:41:20,786
What I'd like to do right now is just run,
for a sound check, "Man in the Mirror."

1488
01:41:20,988 --> 01:41:23,718
Okay.
And then we'll talk about the ending.

1489
01:41:23,924 --> 01:41:25,949
MJ Air.

1490
01:41:27,094 --> 01:41:28,561
Your favorite part.

1491
01:41:28,763 --> 01:41:30,492
Right?

1492
01:41:31,265 --> 01:41:33,460
They'd love that.
You have to do it like MJ.

1493
01:41:33,667 --> 01:41:34,725
No, no, no.

1494
01:41:34,935 --> 01:41:36,163
You know you love that part.

1495
01:41:36,404 --> 01:41:37,393
I love when you...

1496
01:41:38,005 --> 01:41:39,131
No, no.

1497
01:41:39,673 --> 01:41:43,404
That's how the stewardesses do it,
I love when they do that.

1498
01:41:44,011 --> 01:41:45,137
I love it.

1499
01:41:45,379 --> 01:41:49,440
When I was in third grade, the first song
I sang in school was "Man in the Mirror."

1500
01:41:49,650 --> 01:41:52,380
So it's kind of cool, like,
going from that to this,

1501
01:41:52,586 --> 01:41:54,281
singing it onstage with Michael.

1502
01:41:54,755 --> 01:41:57,747
So it's just an amazing experience
to be onstage with him.

1503
01:41:57,958 --> 01:41:59,255
He's such an amazing artist.

1504
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:02,759
# And no message
Could have been any clearer #

1505
01:42:02,963 --> 01:42:05,158
# If you wanna make the world
A better place #

1506
01:42:05,399 --> 01:42:08,391
# Take a look at yourself
And then make a change #

1507
01:42:08,602 --> 01:42:11,935
# I'm starting with
The man in the mirror #

1508
01:42:12,139 --> 01:42:13,197
# Whoo #

1509
01:42:13,441 --> 01:42:16,808
# I'm asking him
To change his ways #

1510
01:42:17,011 --> 01:42:18,000
# Whoo #

1511
01:42:18,212 --> 01:42:21,807
# And no message
Could have been any clearer #

1512
01:42:22,016 --> 01:42:24,280
# If you wanna make the world
A better place #

1513
01:42:24,485 --> 01:42:27,477
# Take a look at yourself
And then make that change #

1514
01:42:27,655 --> 01:42:31,147
# I'm starting with
The man in the mirror #

1515
01:42:31,358 --> 01:42:32,347
# Oh, yeah #

1516
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:35,961
# I'm asking him
To change his ways #

1517
01:42:36,163 --> 01:42:37,289
# To change #

1518
01:42:37,498 --> 01:42:41,298
# No message
Could have been any clearer #

1519
01:42:41,502 --> 01:42:43,333
# If you wanna make the world
A better place #

1520
01:42:43,537 --> 01:42:45,471
# Take a look at yourself
And then make a change #

1521
01:42:45,673 --> 01:42:48,233
# You gotta get it right
While you got the time #

1522
01:42:48,476 --> 01:42:51,639
# Cos when you close your heart #
# You can't close your, your mind #

1523
01:42:51,846 --> 01:42:55,680
# That man #
# That man in the mirror, oh, yeah #

1524
01:42:55,883 --> 01:42:57,373
# That man, that man #

1525
01:42:57,585 --> 01:43:00,713
# That man, that man #
# Make a change #

1526
01:43:00,955 --> 01:43:04,721
# You know, you know, you know #

1527
01:43:04,959 --> 01:43:07,325
# If you wanna make the world
A better place #

1528
01:43:07,528 --> 01:43:10,224
# Take a look at yourself
And then make that change #

1529
01:43:10,731 --> 01:43:11,823
# Whoo! #

1530
01:43:12,032 --> 01:43:14,057
# Whoo! Whoo! #
# Na-na-na, na-na-na #

1531
01:43:14,268 --> 01:43:16,498
# Whoo! Whoo! #
# Na-na-na, na-na-na #

1532
01:43:16,704 --> 01:43:18,365
# Whoo! Whoo! #

1533
01:43:18,572 --> 01:43:20,233
# Gonna feel real good #

1534
01:43:20,474 --> 01:43:21,702
# Yeah, yeah #

1535
01:43:21,909 --> 01:43:24,275
# Yeah, yeah #
# Na-na-na, na-na-na #

1536
01:43:24,512 --> 01:43:28,004
# Ooh #
# Oh, no, no, no #

1537
01:43:29,617 --> 01:43:32,552
# I'm gonna make a change #

1538
01:43:32,753 --> 01:43:35,847

01:52:16,543 --> 01:52:20,274
I'm gonna button my shirt
or my jacket or whatever it is.

1678
01:52:20,514 --> 01:52:24,041
I'm gonna look around a little bit,
play with them.

1679
01:52:26,119 --> 01:52:28,087
Snap my fingers maybe, then bam!

Whoo!
