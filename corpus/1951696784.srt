1
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:41,032
( accordion playing )

2
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:02,554
Radio announcer:
And remember to join us this weekend

3
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:04,119
for the Polish
Heritage Festival

4
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:06,029
featuring a battle
of the polka bands

5
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,761
at the Buffalo
Civic Center.

6
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,860
And after that, join us
for the pierogi eating--

7
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,803
( clicks off )

8
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:40,591
( man singing in Spanish )

9
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:48,993
- Stef.
- Hey.

10
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:51,629
We missed you
at dinner last night.

11
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,571
- Pam made pierogies.
- I was tired.

12
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:58,841
I bet.

13
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:00,709
You doing all right, Frank?
How's your mood?

14
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,842
I'm fine.

15
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,978
Yeah, you know,
I've been reading

16
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,181
about that Seasonal
Affective Disorder.

17
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,780
So?

18
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:13,951
Amtrak station.

19
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:16,188
O'Leary's getting on a train
to New York late tonight.

20
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,527
Apparently, it's
stopping just for him.

21
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,055
Fancy.

22
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,565
This one's real
important, Frank.

23
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,400
Who you telling?

24
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:32,275
Listen, forget it.

25
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,836
Want to stick around?
The game's on.

26
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,575
I promised Daniel
I'd go sledding with him.

27
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,913
Hey.

28
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,578
Great.

29
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,615
Just make sure O'Leary
doesn't get on that train.

30
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,559
( door slams )

31
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,158
( train rattling )

32
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:18,017
Announcer on P.A. :
The Lake Shore Limited Amtrak number 49

33
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:20,252
now departing
for Cleveland, Toledo,

34
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,090
South Bend and Chicago.

35
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,426
- Track nine. All aboard.
- ( car starts )

36
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,659
Man on radio:... makes fun of Polish
people and that's just not funny.

37
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,826
Man #2: Polish jokes are funny
'cause they're about Poles.

38
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,733
That's-- that's
why they're funny.

39
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,965
Man: You know like-- you take
a joke like this, you know.

40
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,997
Um, how do you get
a one-armed Polack out of a tree?

41
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,100
- Man #2: How?
- Man: You wave to him.

42
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:39,168
- See, that's not funny.
- Man #2: I think it's funny.

43
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,873
Man: They're not funny.
I'm Polish...

44
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,726
( train rattling )

45
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,899
Mr. O'Leary,
the train's here.

46
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,529
Where'd you get
that hat, James?

47
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:10,007
I took it off a snowman.

48
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:11,635
You look like an idiot.

49
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,145
Yes, I do.

50
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:14,908
James:
You know, my grandfather

51
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:16,847
was killed
at Pearl Harbor.

52
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,408
- O'Leary: These guys are Chinese.
- James: I don't care.

53
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,886
O'Leary: We need their money,
so shut up and smile.

54
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:27,586
We'll bring you
back an egg roll.

55
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:30,255
( car starts )

56
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:31,854
Here.

57
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,394
- Uncle Roman.
- No no no. No excuses.

58
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:08,366
- He never came.
- You slept right through it!

59
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,562
O'Leary's been
in New York for an hour!

60
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,230
I told you how
important this was.

61
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:14,296
Let me go to New York.

62
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,070
He'll be dead 15 minutes
after I get off the train.

63
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,941
You know what
the Chinese money means?

64
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,446
- Stef: All you had to do was kill him.
- I will.

65
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,449
No no,
it's too late.

66
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,543
When Eddie O'Leary
gets back from Chinatown,

67
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,281
the Irish are
gonna take the...

68
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,380
tiny piece of this city

69
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,755
that the blacks
don't already have.

70
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,488
And when that happens,
the Poles have nothing!

71
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:38,258
- Thank you!
- ( hacking, retching )

72
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,959
Oh God.
We've got to do something.

73
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,298
Not we, Dad. Him.

74
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,860
Just let me go to New York.

75
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,464
- We're not talking about that.
- You've got a problem, Frank.

76
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:50,374
Stef:
Yeah, a substance abuse problem.

77
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,139
Roman:
We can't let you do this to the family.

78
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,476
And we can't watch you
do it to yourself.

79
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:56,209
I just need
a few days to rest.

80
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,082
- Stef: Not good enough!
- Every time we send you out,

81
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,245
I have to make
a call to find out if they're dead.

82
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:02,982
I can't trust you
anymore, Frank!

83
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:05,820
- Even if you are my nephew.
- Stef: You let us down.

84
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,450
I want you to get yourself
into a program.

85
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,256
- Like hell.
- No, I mean it.

86
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,263
- I want you to go to San Francisco.
- Why?

87
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,594
Because I said so.

88
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,397
Stef: Look, you need to be
in a new environment.

89
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,461
What, they don't
have beer there?

90
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:21,132
Frank, we're just trying
to facilitate your recovery--

91
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,642
All right now, Stef!
Put it to rest.

92
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:26,770
Now, this is not
advice, Frank. This is it.

93
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,508
You go to San Francisco...

94
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,177
and get into AA

95
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:34,118
and you clean yourself up!

96
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,117
Or you don't
work for us anymore.

97
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,828
And we can't let you
work for anybody else.

98
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:48,459
Even if you are family.

99
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,265
All right, then.

100
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,295
Come on.
We've got streets to plow.

101
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,810
Frank:
Why San Francisco?

102
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,111
We can look out
for you there.

103
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,776
Roman's got a guy.

104
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,485
Hey, you'll be getting
away from the snow.

105
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,319
I like the snow.

106
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,621
- ( bells chime )
- Announcer: Your attention, please.

107
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,752
So do you hate me now

108
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,319
'cause I did this?

109
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,695
Right now, pretty much.

110
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,131
It won't last.

111
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,499
Try me.

112
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,169
I got you something.

113
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,905
- So when do you think you'll be back?
- How the fuck do I know?

114
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,283
( blues music playing )

115
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:53,925
# Yesterday's mistake #

116
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,504
# Has made my life #

117
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,973
# An uphill climb #

118
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,004
# Now I'm wondering
which road #

119
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,037
# Should I take #

120
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,606
# Mm-hmm #

121
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:14,814
# To make up
the wasted time #

122
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,919
# Lonely days
and sleepless nights... #

123
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,427
( snoring )

124
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,561
# How much more #

125
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,294
# Can a man take? #

126
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:29,858
( phone ringing )

127
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,063
( groans )

128
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:40,938
- Hello!
- Man: Falenczyk?

129
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,106
Yeah.

130
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:44,013
Saint Margaret's,

131
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,677
Geary and 28th,

132
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,551
7:00 p.m.
Be there.

133
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,021
( hangs up )

134
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,421
Great.

135
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,758
( bell ringing )

136
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,284
Man: Okay, so I just want
to let you all know

137
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,298
that, uh, there
is a 12-step progress meeting

138
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,596
here on Sunday night.

139
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,158
I encourage
you all to attend,

140
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,762
and uh, if you want to kick in
for coffee and doughnuts,

141
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,932
see me after
tonight's meeting.

142
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,771
Uh, also,
if you're parked

143
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,333
in the back of the building,

144
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,436
uh, you're gonna have
to move your car by 9:30.

145
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,310
And, uh, one more thing

146
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,316
before I give it
back to Emily:

147
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,285
The Rentals Association
is meeting here on Saturday,

148
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,719
so I would encourage
you all to be here

149
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,950
unless you want to see
your rent go up.

150
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,618
Thanks, uh, Emily?

151
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:30,593
Thanks, Juan.

152
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,961
All right.

153
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:35,229
Anybody new to the meeting
or visiting from someplace else?

154
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,629
I'm Janet
and I'm an alcoholic,

155
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:40,901
and I just moved
up from LA.

156
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,669
- Emily: Hi Janet.
- All: Hi, Janet.

157
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,175
Emily:
Anyone else?

158
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,278
All right, welcome.

159
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:52,307
As I said before, my name
is Emily and I'm an alcoholic.

160
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,615
All:
Hi, Emily.

161
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,420
Last November,
I celebrated my 10th birthday.

162
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:01,893
No drinks,
no drugs for 10 years.

163
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,519
I thought I had it down.

164
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:06,759
I got sober
when I was 21

165
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,427
and I figured at 31
things were different.

166
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,493
So I went out
and had a drink.

167
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:14,165
Just like that,
all grown up.

168
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:17,107
And I woke up in the park
three days later.

169
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,115
So--
( crying )

170
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:35,118
I'm almost glad
I slipped, uh...

171
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,789
'cause it makes me
a grateful alcoholic.

172
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,696
And the more
I live with that,

173
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,896
the more I think it's the best way
for me to go through life--

174
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:45,870
thankful.

175
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,395
Thank you.

176
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,144
Okay. Now it's
time for Juan

177
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,705
to come up and give out
tonight's chips.

178
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,722
So I'm Juan,
addict and alcoholic.

179
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,588
All:
Hi, Juan.

180
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:10,152
Is there anyone here
with six months sobriety?

181
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,361
Hey hey!

182
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,493
( all applauding )

183
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,060
Juan:
Good for you.

184
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,812
Leaving kind of early,
don't you think?

185
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,320
Who the hell are you?

186
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:36,946
Guy with a drinking
problem like yours

187
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,923
probably ought
to stick around.

188
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,653
Where you going now?

189
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:45,024
Probably going
for a drink, I bet.

190
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,624
It's a problem drink...

191
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,964
'cause you've got a drinking problem.
( grunts )

192
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:53,862
You fuck.

193
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,837
- I'm watching you, Frank!
- Who are you?

194
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,737
Roman called me
a few days ago

195
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,044
to tell me you
were coming out.

196
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,479
I'm the one who got
you to this meeting.

197
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,282
Gee, thanks.

198
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,221
Name is Dave.

199
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,452
And I also got you
your apartment.

200
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,687
I'm really scared.

201
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,320
You shouldn't joke, Frank.

202
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,695
In a town with a 2%
vacancy rate,

203
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,427
a real estate agent is God.

204
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,196
And that's what I am--
a real estate agent.

205
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:26,295
It's a swell apartment,
Dave. Go away.

206
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,940
Nope, I'm on
you till you leave.

207
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,635
Can't stop me
from doing anything.

208
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:32,473
I don't have to stop you.
All's I have to do

209
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,309
is watch, wait and make
the call to Buffalo.

210
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,577
You gonna run
and tell Mommy?

211
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,915
That's right, Frank.

212
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:42,853
I'm gonna run
and tell Mommy.

213
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:44,412
Shit.

214
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,516
- I'll see you in the morning.
- For what?

215
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,255
Work.

216
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:57,563
Fuck. Fuck.

217
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,901
Hey, come on.

218
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:08,209
It's kind of along
your line of work.

219
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,738
- I don't need this.
- I don't give a shit what you need.

220
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,918
- Doris.
- Dave.

221
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,384
Where'd he live?

222
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,486
Oh, in Pacific Heights.

223
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:25,925
Own or rent?

224
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,432
Own-- upstairs apartment,

225
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,491
two bedroom.

226
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,526
Swell.

227
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,629
Keys are in his
pants over there.

228
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:36,607
( chuckles )

229
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,303
Ha ha, Doris.

230
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,942
Come on.

231
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,911
Frank Falenczyk,
meet Doris Rainford.

232
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:51,320
Doris said she'd be
willing to hire you on.

233
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,257
- As what?
- General help.

234
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,192
- You'll love it.
- No, I won't love it.

235
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,626
I won't love it so much
I'm not even gonna do it.

236
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,425
- Yes! Yes, you--
- Like hell.

237
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:00,932
You got an unorthodox way of
being interviewed for a job.

238
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:04,830
Just-- keep--

239
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:10,542
Listen, Roman said
to get you a job.

240
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,942
This is it.
It's yours to fuck up.

241
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:15,003
However,
if you fuck it up,

242
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,413
I will be on the phone
to Buffalo.

243
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,151
Guess what, Doris?

244
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:26,180
Frank's decided
to take the job.

245
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:28,983
Super.

246
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,095
Hey.

247
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,761
( chattering )

248
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,998
Hi, I'm Becky,

249
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,935
addict and alcoholic.

250
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,461
Hi.
Frank.

251
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,107
Hand me a plate.

252
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,631
Thanks.

253
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:19,473
( clicking tongue )

254
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:26,674
- I also got an eating disorder.
- Good for you.

255
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,584
What, that I can say it?

256
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,679
Yeah, it took me so long.

257
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,991
And then I realized...

258
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:36,718
I was never full because

259
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,286
I felt so empty inside.

260
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,195
( slams coffeepot )

261
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:49,897
No no, you're-- you're
not supposed to eat those.

262
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,739
They're just
for show, okay?

263
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,335
Oh.

264
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,543
I'm kidding.

265
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,209
- I'm Tom.
- Frank.

266
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,913
- Hi. This your first time?
- I've had cookies before.

267
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,683
Mmm.

268
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,520
So what do you
think so far?

269
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,150
It's all right.
A little talky.

270
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,252
Yeah, you know, um,

271
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,559
some people kinda
tend to wallow in it.

272
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,589
But me, you know,

273
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,999
I'll go months at a time
without saying anything.

274
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:21,499
Plus, it's a really
good place to meet guys.

275
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,906
Um, I'm not...

276
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,902
It's okay.

277
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,537
I'll get over it.

278
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,276
Hi. Brenda, alcoholic.

279
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,341
All:
Hi, Brenda.

280
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,875
Brenda:
Just a couple of things:

281
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,512
They're ripping up
the playground next door,

282
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,352
so you'll have
to park on the street

283
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,550
for the next few weeks;

284
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:42,082
Second, uh, I have
a new list of sponsors

285
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:44,288
if anyone
is looking or...

286
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:45,796
Iooking to switch.

287
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,765
Raise your hands
when I call your names.

288
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,429
Tom, Robin and Susan

289
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,131
have all volunteered.

290
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:55,072
Tom's voice:
And the thing is, at a certain point,

291
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:58,201
you just decide that
the bar is not an option.

292
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,109
I just decide that?

293
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:02,738
Odds are you're
gonna drink again.

294
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,476
You have to want to quit.

295
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,711
- It doesn't seem like you do.
- Part of me does.

296
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,276
Which part?

297
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,379
Some part I don't like.

298
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,448
- Oh, like the dark meat on the chicken?
- Yeah.

299
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:16,188
Frank...

300
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,128
give it up
because you want to,

301
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:20,825
not because everybody
in the room's staring at you.

302
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:23,232
The first year,
it's all about trying.

303
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,997
If you think it's
about solving your problem,

304
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,096
you'll fail... a lot.

305
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,663
I'm already
pretty good at that.

306
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:31,642
You wouldn't be giving up
anything that you need.

307
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:34,403
Does that mean
you're my sponsor?

308
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,004
Does that mean
you're asking?

309
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,778
Is this the part
where we kiss?

310
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,544
Let's not make this any
harder than it's got to be.

311
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:10,673
Thanks for coming.

312
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:13,310
- Have a nice time in New York?
- I'm happy.

313
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,979
You see any shows?

314
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,551
Roman...

315
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,494
nothing drastic
needs to happen.

316
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,656
I'm completely agreeable.

317
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:31,294
You can plow and I can
offer you 15c

318
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,396
on every dollar that we take off
the union skim at Bethlehem Steel--

319
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,430
You cleared this
with your Chinese daddy?

320
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,375
Let's get something
straight, okay?

321
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,470
They're just the money.
I still do all of my own--

322
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,311
I started this business after the war--
me and Stan Falenczyk.

323
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,749
- We had nothing but a plow--
- Would you please spare me

324
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,309
that GI Diary bullshit?

325
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,787
You and that other
thug started a gang

326
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:52,449
just like everybody
else around here.

327
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:55,085
You got rich, you had a good run,
and now it's time to retire.

328
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,651
Hey!

329
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,822
This isn't just about business,
you Irish asshole.

330
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,764
This is what I do.

331
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,893
If you take it, there isn't
dick left for me in Buffalo.

332
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,599
Well, then get
out of Buffalo.

333
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,530
Woman:
Hey, are you Frank?

334
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,226
That's me.

335
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:38,031
- Doris said you could help me.
- I'm not following.

336
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,560
I'm Laurel Pearson.

337
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,129
I'm looking
for my stepfather.

338
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:44,142
- And there he is.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

339
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:45,803
Don't worry about it.
He's already dead.

340
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:49,844
What'd he do,
tie it himself?

341
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,815
It's not that
easy in reverse.

342
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,512
Mm-hmm. We need
to change his shoes.

343
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,145
- We do?
- Yep.

344
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,053
Mom wanted him buried
in his favorite shoes.

345
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,650
He was a big bowler.

346
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,422
You don't seem
too broken up.

347
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,264
- Even people you don't like die.
- Yeah.

348
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,135
I was thinking he
kind of looked like a prick.

349
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:15,867
- If you don't mind me saying.
- No.

350
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:18,102
No, not at all.

351
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:19,872
Also...

352
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,106
he-- he seems
to have enormous feet.

353
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:23,910
Yeah, well, those
aren't his shoes.

354
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,348
I couldn't find his.

355
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,409
I stole those
from the Chestnut Lanes.

356
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,851
Don't tell my mom.

357
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,156
Might have to
break his toes.

358
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,724
Whatever gets the job done.

359
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,296
Laurel:
You look beautiful.

360
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,002
( mourners murmuring )

361
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:56,543
He looks real nice.
Good job.

362
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:57,912
Thanks.

363
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:00,315
Next time you might want
to ease up on the rouge.

364
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:03,219
He's looking
a little Raggedy Andy.

365
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,450
I wanted to thank you.
Abe looks like a real sport.

366
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,085
I'm glad you're pleased.

367
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:13,256
I'm sure he appreciates
how much care you gave to--

368
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,596
well, to make
every-- everything--

369
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,126
Take it easy, Mom.
Here.

370
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:24,364
Just think, he's going out
wearing his favorite shoes.

371
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:26,536
- And they fit like a glove.
- Oh.

372
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:29,308
Doris:
Can I help you to the car, ma'am?

373
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,248
That'd be fine.
Thank you.

374
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,911
Laurel:
Hang on a second.

375
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,252
His lipstick was smeared.

376
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,763
I got the eyes down.
I'm still working on the mouth.

377
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:48,756
You like working
with makeup?

378
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,668
I prefer it on women, really.

379
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,537
Guess it's hard to meet real live ones
in your line of work.

380
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,667
I'm usually in the back.

381
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,870
Although I've heard of
some people in your position,

382
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,936
you know, making do.

383
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,617
- ( chattering )
- Man: I'll see you there.

384
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:10,518
Thank you.

385
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,216
You're very strong.

386
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,820
Think my mother
might think you're cute.

387
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,523
She's been through a lot.

388
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:22,023
Hey, so maybe
I'll see you soon.

389
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,399
Jeez, I hope not.
Mom's still pretty frisky.

390
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,903
And I'm perfectly healthy.

391
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,407
No, look, if nobody dies,

392
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,069
maybe we could
get coffee sometime.

393
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,508
Sure.
That'd be nice.

394
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,014
( grinding )

395
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:37,341
Dave:
It's a housewarming present.

396
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:43,102
No. Yeah, right.
I forgot, you're a killer.

397
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,809
What do you want?

398
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:48,217
Roman wanted to make sure
you were okay out here.

399
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:52,546
I know you know he's
got his hands full back in Buffalo.

400
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:54,821
So...

401
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:57,686
I said I'd check.
I checked.

402
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:59,526
- And?
- Mmm.

403
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:03,022
You ball your socks,
you floss.

404
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:05,730
And you don't hide booze
in the toilet tank.

405
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:12,205
- You live like a Mormon.
- You want to look up my ass, too?

406
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:14,901
Maybe later.

407
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,077
Cashew butter...

408
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:22,485
Mmm, it's like peanut butter,
but with cashews.

409
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,887
Well, what is
wrong with peanuts?

410
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:31,696
Remind me to be
nice to you, cock.

411
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:36,259
( phone ringing )

412
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,369
Hello?

413
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:44,068
- Frank: Hello, Laurel?
- Who's this?

414
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:47,442
Frank.
Frank Falenczyk...

415
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:49,174
from the funeral home.

416
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,011
Finally.

417
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,846
What?

418
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:55,717
Frank Falenczyk,
funeral, finally.

419
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:57,551
Just playing with the F's.

420
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,056
For fun.

421
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,557
Oh, hmm.

422
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,082
Uh...

423
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:03,594
fabulous.

424
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:05,528
- I'm glad you called.
- Yeah?

425
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,759
Yeah, I need
those shoes back.

426
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,027
What?

427
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:12,059
- Just kidding, Frank.
- ( laughs )

428
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:15,163
Listen...
( clears throat )

429
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,197
- Do you want to go out tonight?
- Out?

430
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,802
- Yeah, with me.
- Oh, "out."

431
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,439
Well, yeah.

432
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,940
Fucking great.
I'm there.

433
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,714
- Where?
- What?

434
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,153
Calling you is about as far
as I got planningwise.

435
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,651
- Well, I know places.
- Great.

436
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:36,661
- Frank.
- Yeah?

437
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:39,797
I'm glad my
stepfather died.

438
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:44,962
( dial tone )

439
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:47,733
You know,
it's a whole lot easier

440
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,400
fucking girls you don't like

441
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,966
when you're really drunk.

442
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:55,275
I realize that may
sound harsh,

443
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:57,213
but in my defense, a lot
of them were drunk too.

444
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,848
If anyone was being
taken advantage of,

445
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:02,409
it was me.

446
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,888
And that had to stop.

447
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:06,686
Because it was there...

448
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,283
See you tomorrow.

449
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,824
...but it gets
old pretty quick

450
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:13,888
in terms
of nailing chicks.

451
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:15,923
- ( snoring )
- Man: Why am I here?

452
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,594
( whispering )
Frank.

453
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,695
Frank.

454
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,206
You okay?

455
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,435
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- So where are you headed?

456
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:28,139
I have a...
thing to do.

457
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,704
( laughs )

458
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:33,274
You know, if you're
going to drink, drink.

459
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,878
But please don't feel like
you need to lie to me--

460
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,548
I'm not gonna drink.

461
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,649
- Okay. See you.
- No, really.

462
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,717
Um, I mean--

463
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,524
I have a--

464
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:49,597
A what, Frank?

465
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:52,831
A date.
Is that okay?

466
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,600
- You think it's okay?
- I don't know.

467
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:56,504
I'm not sure I've
ever done it sober.

468
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:58,441
That's why at the beginning
there's not always room

469
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:01,536
for both the program
and women.

470
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:04,047
Or men for that matter.

471
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:06,243
And you should just
know going into it

472
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:08,377
that... there's
the possibility

473
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,479
it might not turn out
that well, that's all.

474
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,820
You're giving me
tremendous confidence here.

475
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,553
L-- I just mean that...

476
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:17,686
you might be more raw
than you realize.

477
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:19,794
Frank:
Do you mind if I ask what you do?

478
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,822
I sell time.

479
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,458
I thought that
was still free.

480
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:26,834
Only on PBS, and even then
you've got to buy a tote bag.

481
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,395
You lost me again.

482
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,431
Commercial time
for Channel 8.

483
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:33,911
I was the Bay Area's
top selling rep last year.

484
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:36,072
They gave me a plaque
to hang on the wall.

485
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:38,207
Hey, congratulations.

486
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:40,945
It's not like the advertisers
had any choice.

487
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:43,545
- The word "no" means nothing to me.
- ( laughs )

488
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:45,283
( koto music playing )

489
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:54,621
- I should tell you something.
- You're gay.

490
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:57,829
I'm in AA.
I just started.

491
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,769
I'm raw.

492
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:02,664
Oh.

493
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:06,871
Well, are--
are you okay?

494
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,175
I mean, you're not gonna

495
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:10,875
run out right now
and get wrecked, are you?

496
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:14,373
- No. I'm fine.
- Well, okay then.

497
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,216
As long as you're not gay.

498
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,279
Thanks for telling me.

499
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:20,314
It doesn't bother you?

500
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:22,519
- You said you just started, right?
- Right.

501
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,425
- How many people have you told?
- So far...

502
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:28,692
- you.
- Why me?

503
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:30,598
I don't know.

504
00:29:30,635 --> 00:29:33,468
It seemed important
to start off honest.

505
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:40,176
Mmm, that doesn't
bother me at all.

506
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:47,480
Besides, if I had to deal with dead
bodies all day, I'd be drinking too.

507
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,248
Oh, I'm okay
with the dead bodies.

508
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:54,881
Frank:
"I came to believe

509
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:57,087
that a power
greater than myself

510
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,154
could restore me to sanity."

511
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:01,722
Driver:
Thank you.

512
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:04,462
- Do you believe in God?
- I went to First Communion.

513
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:06,129
Think that's
the last time I saw Him.

514
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:07,798
Well, uh,
it doesn't have to be

515
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,739
the guy on the cross
or a golden calf.

516
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:12,743
You know, it can be-- be anything.
It's a God of your understanding.

517
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:15,541
You know, you can
make it a mountain,

518
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,514
make it a bridge,
make it whatever you want.

519
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,780
Just make it something big,
something good and not yourself.

520
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,251
I generally like
to run my own show.

521
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:34,231
Yeah, you've done
a real good job of that so far.

522
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:36,460
- Thank you.
- Even if I did believe in God,

523
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,696
I'm not so sure he'd want to have
anything to do with me.

524
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:41,705
Oh, the alcoholic's God
is a very forgiving God, Frank.

525
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:43,798
He's got to be.

526
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,668
I kill people.

527
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,577
- Excuse me?
- It's my job.

528
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,481
I've been doing it
almost my whole life.

529
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,042
I mean, I get
paid to do it.

530
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:57,486
I don't just
pick 'em randomly.

531
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,184
In any case,
I don't feel much guilt about it.

532
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:03,126
My drinking was interfering
with my work.

533
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:04,890
That's why I'm here,
so I can get sober

534
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:07,227
and go back to killing
people full time.

535
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:12,597
- Did you hear what I said?
- L-- l-- I did hear you.

536
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:15,128
I'm just trying to figure out
if you're being serious or not.

537
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:18,574
- What do you think?
- I think you're being serious.

538
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,971
Hello, my--

539
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:23,480
I hope this
doesn't scare you off.

540
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:25,141
Driver:
Hey, I gave you a 20.

541
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:27,048
No, l--

542
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:29,019
l-- I just want to know

543
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,112
that it's not something
you do for recreation.

544
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:32,349
No, it's not.

545
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,255
Hey, you gave me
the wrong change.

546
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:35,953
Are you drunk
when you do this?

547
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:37,586
Frank:
Not always.

548
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,392
But sometimes
I couldn't go drinking

549
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:42,024
'cause I had
to kill somebody.

550
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,466
And sometimes
I'd miss killing somebody

551
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:46,026
'cause I was out drinking.

552
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,628
To think I was, uh,

553
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,196
nervous about you
going on a date.

554
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,707
- Hello.
- Yeah?

555
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,835
- My change.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

556
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:56,438
- What'd you give me?
- Just keep it.

557
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:57,914
( tires screech )

558
00:31:57,949 --> 00:31:59,439
I don't know
how you do this.

559
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:06,914
( phone ringing )

560
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:11,860
- Hello.
- Stef: I'm just waiting for my wife.

561
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:14,956
- She's trying on bikinis in there.
- Stef.

562
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:16,728
Really, I have to tell her
if she looks good or not.

563
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,793
No. You have to
stay out here.

564
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:22,130
- Frank: Where are you?
- At the mall.

565
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:24,437
So why are you
calling me?

566
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:27,467
Hey, remember when you
had to go to Florida for six months

567
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,503
after that
Canadian thing?

568
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:32,778
- Yeah.
- How was that for kids? Did--

569
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:35,217
- did they have a pool?
- What's going on, Stef?

570
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:38,689
Pam and Daniel are going
down there for a while.

571
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:40,554
You're not
going with them?

572
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:42,252
They have to go.

573
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,954
I have to stay.

574
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:45,587
O'Leary's being
an asshole.

575
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,155
Watch your back.
They might come after you.

576
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:51,259
- You want me to come home?
- Nah, forget it.

577
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:53,929
You're out,
stay out--

578
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,837
Yeah, Stef,
but I should be there.

579
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:57,841
Guess I just wanted
to hear your voice.

580
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:00,173
# Dupayash! #

581
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:02,008
( chuckles )
Yeah.

582
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:19,190
You're not pregnant,
are you?

583
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:23,495
Not unless you put
something in my egg roll.

584
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:25,559
And then put my
egg roll in my--

585
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:28,197
- Did I tell you where I lived?
- No, you didn't.

586
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:30,901
I called the funeral home.

587
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:33,137
Doris didn't
want to tell me.

588
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,042
Then I told her I was
from the AIDS clinic

589
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,013
and had to get you
your test results,

590
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:39,175
you know, right away.

591
00:33:39,217 --> 00:33:41,242
Oh, good.

592
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:43,549
I can't wait
to see her.

593
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:47,014
Come on,
I'll walk with you.

594
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:55,061
You should try this.

595
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:57,624
It's easier on the shins.

596
00:33:57,668 --> 00:33:59,863
So you're coming
to dinner at my house.

597
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:02,805
It's 9:00 in the morning.
Can we make it later?

598
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,240
- Later, sure, but you'll be there.
- Okay.

599
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:07,039
- See you tonight then.
- Hey, wouldn't want

600
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:10,275
- to take me down the rest of the way?
- Maybe later.

601
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:14,978
Hi. How are
the dead this morning?

602
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:16,316
Shut up.

603
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:19,551
- I'm in a good mood, okay?
- Not on my time.

604
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,114
Who's this?

605
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,252
- Patrick Heaney.
- What happened?

606
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:25,228
Well, Mr. Heaney
had a heart attack

607
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:27,959
on top of a long
flight of stairs.

608
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:30,558
Ouch.

609
00:34:30,601 --> 00:34:32,899
Yeah. Wake's tonight.

610
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:35,997
He's got to be flushed,
prepped and casketed by 4:00.

611
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,372
I look forward to working
with you, Dr. Rainford.

612
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,775
Jesus, you're annoying
when you're happy.

613
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,991
( cracks )

614
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:23,412
Now that is one
good-looking dead man.

615
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:29,153
- ( laughing, chattering )
- ( Irish folk music playing )

616
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,695
( laughing )

617
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,946
Ah! I'm drinking that.

618
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,676
Sorry.

619
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:53,650
He hasn't looked
that alive in years.

620
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,242
I was working
from old pictures.

621
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:58,984
- You did this?
- Mm-hmm.

622
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:00,888
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

623
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:04,156
God bless you.
You did good work here.

624
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:06,459
I'm Walter Fitzgerald.

625
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,294
Frank Falenczyk.

626
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,994
Patrick here
was my wife's brother.

627
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:13,469
- She's taking it pretty hard.
- ( women laughing )

628
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:16,837
- I can see that.
- Would you have a drink with us, Frank?

629
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:19,468
No, thank you.
I'm trying to quit.

630
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,876
I tried that once.
Didn't take.

631
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:23,608
When did you start?

632
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:25,479
- Not too long ago.
- What's the difference then?

633
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,007
- Have a nip.
- No, really. Thank you.

634
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:31,078
You'd refuse a dying man
his last request?

635
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:32,885
Sorry.
You dying?

636
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:35,620
( laughing ) For fuck's sake,
I'm talking about Patrick.

637
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,491
That's what this
party's all about--

638
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,155
sending him on his way.

639
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,222
Thank you. Really.

640
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:43,130
I can't.
I'm working.

641
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:44,759
I got to keep
an eye on things.

642
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,895
He's not going anywhere.

643
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,907
Ah, Katie!

644
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:51,841
This is Frank
from the parlor.

645
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,367
He's who fixed up
our Patrick all nice like this.

646
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:56,277
Oh, God bless you.

647
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:57,975
Oh, that's nice.

648
00:36:58,015 --> 00:36:59,812
Margie Rose.
Margie, look.

649
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,683
This is the man who
fixed Patrick's cheekbones.

650
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,412
Aw, bless your heart.

651
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:07,083
Will you have a drink
with us, Frank, huh?

652
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:09,558
- Uh, really, I shouldn't.
- Says he's on the wagon.

653
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:11,528
Really? What is he,
some kind of Mary?

654
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,257
( laughing )

655
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:15,492
To Patrick!

656
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:17,967
May neighbors
respect you,

657
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:21,961
troubles neglect you,
the angels protect you

658
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:23,598
and Heaven accept you.

659
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,802
To Patrick, the biggest
pain in my ass!

660
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:28,277
- ( Frank laughs )
- And the best friend I could have ever

661
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:30,280
thought of having.
To Patrick!

662
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:32,805
All:
To Patrick!

663
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,725
( sighs )

664
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:44,227
- Na zdorovya!
- ( all cheering )

665
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,287
All:
Na zdorovya!

666
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,696
Whoa, hey!

667
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:50,360
Get this man
another drink!

668
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,957
Laurel:
Douchebag.

669
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:30,864
Cocksucker.

670
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:39,577
Fuckhead.

671
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:41,744
Frank:
Who wants to give me a ride?

672
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:43,720
Kathleen:
We're taking the bus home.

673
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:46,621
Walter will come and pick up
the car in the morning...

674
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,682
- after Mass.
- Aw, for fuck's sake.

675
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:50,489
Come on!
I'll drive your car.

676
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:52,189
I can walk home from there.

677
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:53,821
You don't know
where we live.

678
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:55,388
Nonsense, nonsense!

679
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,833
The bus is for cripples
and old people.

680
00:38:57,868 --> 00:38:59,699
All right, okay.

681
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,728
( coughing )

682
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:04,366
( Kathleen moans )

683
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,538
Kathleen:
Left is your brakes, right is your gas

684
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,410
and everything
else is the same.

685
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,211
- Frank: Right.
- ( van starts )

686
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:14,979
- ( revs, tires screech )
- Kathleen: It's all right.

687
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:19,851
- ( Kathleen coughing )
- Think you could pull over maybe?

688
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,915
I've got the bladder
of an 80-year-old man.

689
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:23,756
Walter, we're almost home.

690
00:39:23,794 --> 00:39:25,887
- You can hold it.
- Would you like to hold it for me?

691
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,626
( Kathleen groans )
Francis, pull over.

692
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:37,330
( tires screech )

693
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:41,869
Radio:
# And they call it lonesome town... #

694
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:45,571
( unzips )

695
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,581
Francis, can you do
an old woman a favor?

696
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:54,090
Sure. What is it?

697
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:56,116
- Give us a kiss.
- ( laughing )

698
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,253
- Oh!
- Just a quick one.

699
00:39:58,295 --> 00:40:00,092
- Walter won't mind.
- I don't-- I don't think--

700
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:02,326
- ( tires squealing )
- Frank: We're moving!

701
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,434
( screaming )

702
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:11,635
( air hissing )

703
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:15,167
- ( dog barking )
- ( thunder rumbling )

704
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:25,750
- Kathleen!
- ( Kathleen groaning )

705
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,224
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right.

706
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,284
What happened?

707
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:32,386
Uh...

708
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,194
Walter, he made
a pass at me.

709
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:37,996
- ( thunder rumbling )
- Why the--

710
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:40,060
# In the town #

711
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:44,200
# Of broken dreams #

712
00:40:44,241 --> 00:40:47,233
# The streets are
filled with regret... #

713
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,007
( dogs barking )

714
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:54,275
( coughing, sniffs )

715
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:01,518
- You look like shit.
- I need to tell you something.

716
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,857
No, you really don't.
Hey, get the fuck out.

717
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,258
( groaning )

718
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:17,101
I missed dinner
last night

719
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,440
because I got drunk
with little Irish people.

720
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,174
Well, you missed
some really good chicken.

721
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:24,738
You didn't
even occur to me.

722
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,141
Oh, well, fuck you too.

723
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:29,550
I'm sorry.

724
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,919
I thought you were in AA.

725
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:34,220
I thought you were supposed
to be done with this crap.

726
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:36,749
- It's not that simple.
- I don't need simple.

727
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:39,126
I just don't
need assholes.

728
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,926
I like you!

729
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,728
You shouldn't
be in the dark.

730
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:44,859
I'm gonna tell you
everything you need to know.

731
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:47,336
I thought you
did that last time.

732
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:49,202
- There's more.
- There always is.

733
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,605
I don't need this.

734
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:52,199
I've heard a lot
of lies in my life--

735
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:56,905
You haven't
heard them from me.

736
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:04,514
The drinking was
messing with my work.

737
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:06,853
- At the funeral home?
- ( sniffs )

738
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:08,415
No, that's temporary.

739
00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:11,155
- What do you do?
- I'm in personnel.

740
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,857
- Hiring?
- Firing, more like.

741
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,762
Anybody sitting
on a drink tonight?

742
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:26,910
Come on up.

743
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,377
- Emily: What's your name?
- Frank.

744
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:36,113
Everybody, here's Frank.

745
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,760
Hi, I'm Frank
and I'm an alcoholic.

746
00:42:44,795 --> 00:42:46,262
All:
Hi, Frank.

747
00:42:46,297 --> 00:42:47,821
Yeah.

748
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:50,197
( clears throat )
I didn't really know

749
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,929
I was an alcoholic
until recently.

750
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:53,800
I'm from Buffalo.

751
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:55,532
Drinking's a pretty
obvious thing to do there

752
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:59,373
and, you know, there's
work and then there's...

753
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,401
whatever you do when
you're not working.

754
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:04,505
And I was either
working or drinking.

755
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:06,573
And...

756
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:09,381
I guess I thought I kept
the two pretty well separated.

757
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,389
It had to be pointed out
to me that that wasn't...

758
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,084
really true.

759
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:23,790
I kill people.

760
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:28,967
Not with my drinking.

761
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:30,871
I actually kill people...

762
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,933
for a living.

763
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:37,744
I guess that makes me
fucked up, I don't know.

764
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,305
It's the only job
I've ever had

765
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:41,045
and I'm good at it,
at least I was.

766
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:44,649
It's like any business.

767
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:47,213
You-- you have competition,
you identify them,

768
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:48,884
you offer
to buy them out.

769
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:50,416
They don't agree,
you go to other means.

770
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:53,897
Everybody I killed
knew it was a possibility.

771
00:43:58,068 --> 00:43:59,899
I've heard people here

772
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:01,700
blame a lot of stuff
on their families.

773
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:04,636
I don't know.

774
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:06,404
I like mine.
I got a choice--

775
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:10,543
drinking or them.

776
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:14,414
I don't know the exact definition
of the word "alcoholic,"

777
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:16,749
but from what
I'm hearing here,

778
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:18,516
sounds like I'm
a pretty good one.

779
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,920
I'm an even better killer.

780
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,929
I want to do it again.
I will do it again.

781
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:28,721
But I know now,

782
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:30,893
the only way I'm ever
gonna get to do it again

783
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:34,165
is if
I stop drinking...

784
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:38,197
forever.

785
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:41,305
Amen.

786
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:44,170
I know now
I can't do it alone.

787
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:48,380
Proved that to myself
last night.

788
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:53,221
I'm not even sure
I can do it here.

789
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,551
And I'm really scared.

790
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:00,085
Thanks.

791
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,238
Well, thanks
for that, Frank.

792
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,677
Tom: Actually, it went better
than you think. It did.

793
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,619
Laurel: How do you know they
won't tell the police?

794
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:25,986
Frank:
It's Alcoholics Anonymous.

795
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:28,719
Somehow I don't really feel
that's what they had in mind

796
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:31,751
when they came up with the name,
but you never know.

797
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:34,755
How do you kill them?

798
00:45:34,798 --> 00:45:36,390
Well, you just
put it on a level

799
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:38,298
with everything else

800
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:40,030
and you don't
think about it.

801
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,903
That's deep, Frank,
but I meant literally, how do you do it?

802
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,737
Guns, mostly.

803
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:48,004
I need a drink.

804
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:49,672
Can you give me a moment?

805
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:52,045
Of course.

806
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:54,107
( woman screaming )

807
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:58,717
I know it's kind of
a lot to swallow.

808
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,383
You're right.

809
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:06,452
Why should I bother?

810
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:08,931
Because you don't want
to be alone any more than I do.

811
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:15,838
You know, it's sad,

812
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:18,603
but that's actually
good enough for right now.

813
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:25,105
Here.

814
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:27,447
Go kill something.

815
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:31,984
- ( tools buzzing )
- Well, I'll pick 'em up myself.

816
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:35,958
That's a bullshit
excuse, Bill.

817
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:37,984
No, I don't have to try
and understand anything.

818
00:46:38,028 --> 00:46:39,495
Everything I need to know

819
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:41,998
I already understand
pretty goddamn well.

820
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:45,024
So stay at home, Bill,
crack a six pack, watch your TV

821
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:47,059
and make yourself
comfortable,

822
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:48,696
'cause you just
made a big mistake.

823
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:50,604
Who was that?

824
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,836
- Bill Kubala.
- Guy from Diecast Direct.

825
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:55,606
He says they're
out of parts.

826
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,443
The parts guy
is out of parts.

827
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,039
( chuckles )

828
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:00,310
God!

829
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,746
That Irish bastard
is closing his fist.

830
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:08,423
Maybe we should
call the Greeks.

831
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:12,826
- Dad?
- Yeah, all right. Fine.

832
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:16,128
Let's call the goddamn Greeks.

833
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:19,331
You know, it used to be
shit like this happened,

834
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:21,394
we could just call Frank.

835
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:23,770
Frank's not here.

836
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:25,968
Lucky fuck.

837
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,806
( bowling pins clattering )

838
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:30,837
President William McKinley
was assassinated in Buffalo

839
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:33,145
at the Pan-American
Exposition.

840
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,048
Somebody shot
a president in Buffalo

841
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:37,280
and you thought,
"Wow, that's for me"?

842
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:39,755
No, see, he was
shot on the sixth,

843
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,815
but he didn't die
till the 14th.

844
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:44,089
For eight days he was
lying around in some mansion

845
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,652
while the doctors tried
to find the bullet.

846
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:50,960
Oh, yes!

847
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:54,167
No, I still--
I don't see.

848
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,637
They were using
an x-ray machine,

849
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:58,698
but he was lying on a bed
with metal springs.

850
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:01,836
So they couldn't find the bullet.
He got sicker and died.

851
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,779
Isn't that the kind of story
that's supposed to make you

852
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:05,372
grow up and become a doctor?

853
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:08,248
I saw the point in all
that poking around and malingering.

854
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:11,387
You shoot somebody,
you should kill them.

855
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,090
I saw the need
for precision.

856
00:48:17,327 --> 00:48:19,056
Oh!

857
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:20,723
Gutter ball.

858
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:29,095
Can I get you
anything to drink?

859
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:31,073
I've got some
great tap water.

860
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:34,171
Comes out of that
tap right there.

861
00:48:36,713 --> 00:48:38,340
Coffee?

862
00:48:38,382 --> 00:48:40,543
It's a little late
in the day for me.

863
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:47,985
Why are you so nervous?

864
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:49,549
Coffee.

865
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,357
Laurel:
I like older men.

866
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,731
Frank:
Why?

867
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:00,430
Laurel:
Because you're done experimenting.

868
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:02,233
You're not gonna
wake up tomorrow

869
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:03,967
and tell my you're gay.

870
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:06,635
Frank:
What about the drinking

871
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:08,542
and the other thing?

872
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,941
Laurel:
Nobody's perfect, Frank.

873
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:17,777
- Coffee.
- Morning.

874
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,315
What are you
thinking about

875
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:24,486
sitting there
all serious?

876
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:26,189
My shortcomings.

877
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,629
Women don't even
pay attention to that.

878
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:33,726
I'm talking about this.

879
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:37,069
Oh, what is it?

880
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:38,734
People I've harmed.

881
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:41,971
You mean killed?

882
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:44,344
Well, eventually.

883
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:46,246
That's not the point.
I mean harmed.

884
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:48,877
The people
I've killed badly

885
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:51,012
because I was drunk.

886
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,013
This is your whole
precision thing?

887
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:55,547
Yeah.

888
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,727
Like here.
Look, Rod Fitzhugh.

889
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:01,856
Took me seven bullets.

890
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:05,358
And Karen Whittier,
I was supposed to slit her throat.

891
00:50:05,402 --> 00:50:07,267
She moved.
I got her in the eye.

892
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:09,169
Fuck, Frank.

893
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:12,207
It's a little early
in the morning.

894
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:15,369
Well, I'm serious.
Jack Hensley.

895
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:18,677
He saw me first. I had to chase him
two blocks before I got him

896
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:20,239
in a Dairy Queen
parking lot.

897
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:21,807
That's no way to die.

898
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,444
So you got sloppy.

899
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:26,650
You can't unkill them.
They're still dead.

900
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,921
I don't regret killing them,
just killing them badly.

901
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:33,860
So what, then?

902
00:50:33,897 --> 00:50:35,421
I got to make amends.

903
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:42,802
There are many
rewards that flow...

904
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:44,739
from the practice
of making amends.

905
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:49,372
So that's what you do.

906
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:51,278
And you do
what you have to do.

907
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:53,373
Thanks.

908
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:55,749
( cash register beeping )

909
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:59,586
All right, these can be redeemed
in any of our stores nationwide.

910
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:07,961
Clerk:
That's five $25 gift certificates.

911
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:13,730
Well, I can't believe you had
the addresses of their next of kin.

912
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:17,934
Even drunk, I kept
thorough records.

913
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,574
So a knife in the eye

914
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:24,136
is worth 50 bucks off
your next purchase at the Sony store?

915
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,440
It's a start.

916
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:30,385
All:
...to accept the things I cannot change,

917
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,650
the courage to change
the things I can,

918
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:35,556
and the wisdom
to know the difference.

919
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:37,184
Amen.

920
00:51:37,227 --> 00:51:39,127
O'Leary: Let me have a couple
of kielbasa, will you?

921
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,393
Hiya, Roman.

922
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:55,071
Do you know that my wife

923
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,670
loves your sausage?

924
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:16,498
Stef:
We're fucked.

925
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:21,131
Hardwood floors,
of course...

926
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:24,000
with a view on three sides,

927
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,474
five bedrooms,
three and a quarter baths,

928
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:30,207
- marble fireplaces, walk-in closets--
- Dave.

929
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:32,078
It was on the market
in '92.

930
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:34,549
It went for a mil-five.

931
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:37,644
Now it'd go
for six-- 6.5 easy.

932
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:39,245
Why'd you call me?

933
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:42,817
They're tearing it down.

934
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:44,520
Some building inspector
with a bug up his ass

935
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:46,426
did an earthquake
retrofit check.

936
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:48,454
Apparently it's unsafe.

937
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:51,194
And is it?

938
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:53,794
- It's got hardwood floors.
- What does this have to do with me?

939
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:57,837
I made a deal
with the owner.

940
00:52:57,874 --> 00:53:00,502
The city's paying him off,
but he's not getting

941
00:53:00,544 --> 00:53:03,240
the real value
of the property.

942
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,374
The market is bullish, Frank.

943
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,779
This is going to be worth

944
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:14,551
maybe nine mil by
the end of next year.

945
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:16,081
What's your deal, Dave?

946
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:19,027
Well, if I could get
the city off his back

947
00:53:19,062 --> 00:53:22,259
he'll split the profits
with me when he sells.

948
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:23,891
That's very
exciting for you.

949
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:26,459
Yes, it is.

950
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:29,961
And it could be very
exciting for all of us...

951
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:32,531
as I thought there would be
an opportunity

952
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:34,771
for you to...

953
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:36,676
negotiate with the city.

954
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,943
( laughs )

955
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:41,883
Frank, it'll
give you a chance

956
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:43,886
to ease back into things.

957
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,854
You're doing so great
with your recovery.

958
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,823
- Forget it.
- Come on, Frank.

959
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:50,451
- I've been more than courteous.
- You what?

960
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:52,154
I got you your job,

961
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:54,356
got you a nice place to live.
I didn't have to do that.

962
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,558
I could have gotten
you a shitty walk-up in the Tenderloin

963
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,363
or a studio
in the Castro.

964
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,995
You'd be up to your
neck in dog collars and assless chaps

965
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:02,766
if it wasn't for me.

966
00:54:02,806 --> 00:54:05,240
Not to mention
the cashew butter.

967
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:07,368
And asking for help should
not be such a big production.

968
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,344
Why are you walking
like that, anyway?

969
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:15,808
Look, no shooting,
no stabbing.

970
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:18,047
No violence at all
if you can help it.

971
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,989
Just strong,
clear negotiation.

972
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:24,460
- I'll let you know.
- I'd appreciate that.

973
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:27,285
Lick-dick.

974
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:33,601
Becky:
Everybody laughs at the fat girl.

975
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:38,935
But if I'm drunk,
I can't hear them.

976
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:45,006
Maybe the drinking helps me
laugh at the fat girl too.

977
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:52,784
Thanks, Becky.

978
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:55,518
I know we're...

979
00:54:55,558 --> 00:54:57,924
not supposed to respond

980
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,656
directly to each
other's stories,

981
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:03,257
but I was hoping I could
say something to Becky.

982
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:07,393
Is that all right?

983
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:09,234
Yeah.
Yeah, go ahead.

984
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:14,966
Becky, I think I might
know how you feel.

985
00:55:16,446 --> 00:55:18,778
Life for me has pretty
much been a pain in the ass.

986
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,946
And I always thought that
was reason enough to drink.

987
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:26,180
I mean, sure,
now and then,

988
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:28,952
I'd kill somebody
and I'd cash a check,

989
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:31,586
and that made me
feel good, but...

990
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:35,357
I'd just use the money
to drink more.

991
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:38,026
You know?

992
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:41,333
I don't like me either.

993
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:49,536
Be thankful
that something in you

994
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:53,140
had the courage to say
"Enough.

995
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,743
I'm not the worst
fat girl in the world."

996
00:55:59,756 --> 00:56:02,850
Uh, thanks, Frank.

997
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:05,122
No problem.

998
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:11,595
Up next is, uh...

999
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:13,761
John. John?

1000
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:15,595
( jazz music playing )

1001
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:23,740
# I just can't keep
a smile off my face #

1002
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:26,374
# I belong
to the human race #

1003
00:56:26,416 --> 00:56:30,409
# It's my happy day #

1004
00:56:33,456 --> 00:56:36,584
I just take one big
look in your eyes

1005
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:39,686
# And I'm lost
in paradise #

1006
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:44,826
# It's my happy day #

1007
00:56:46,269 --> 00:56:49,568
# It's been
a long time coming #

1008
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:52,973
# I'm gonna make
the most of it #

1009
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:56,274
# Dear, I've been ready #

1010
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:59,645
# A brand new habit
I just can't quit #

1011
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:02,845
# Stars in my eyes,
dreams in my pocket #

1012
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:03,944
# My heart is beating #

1013
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:06,012
# I just can't stop it #

1014
00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:10,583
# It's my happy day #

1015
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:13,460
# Aw, happy, happy... #

1016
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:30,072
You should call Dave.

1017
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:32,081
I don't know.

1018
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:35,548
I know you're nervous,

1019
00:57:35,585 --> 00:57:37,610
but you're doing so well.

1020
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:41,186
You've got real talent

1021
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:43,249
and a real opportunity here.

1022
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,851
I won't let you waste it.

1023
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:51,492
Now, get out there and threaten to kill
that city supervisor.

1024
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:17,816
- Do we have an appointment?
- I just want to grab you for a moment.

1025
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:21,194
- Really?
- Just to talk.

1026
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:23,699
I assume there's a reason
I'm not calling security?

1027
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:25,223
Why aren't you?

1028
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:28,567
I don't know.

1029
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:31,165
As disturbed as I am
to find a man

1030
00:58:31,207 --> 00:58:33,072
in his underwear
in my private office...

1031
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:36,439
I don't exactly feel
like I'm in danger.

1032
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:38,413
There you go.

1033
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:40,643
Supervisor Davis,
the reason I came to you like this

1034
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,913
is precisely so you
wouldn't feel threatened.

1035
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:46,518
Do you mind if I sit?

1036
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:49,753
So, why would
I feel threatened?

1037
00:58:49,792 --> 00:58:51,692
- Are you planning on threatening me?
- Far from it.

1038
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:54,026
I'm here today as a harmless
but concerned taxpayer.

1039
00:58:54,063 --> 00:58:56,031
I'm aware your
time is short,

1040
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:59,000
so I'll just quickly address
my three main points.

1041
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:01,060
One, what I'm proposing
would allow a historic building

1042
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:03,334
to be preserved
for generations to come.

1043
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:06,171
Two, this project would
enhance your reputation

1044
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,335
as a sympathetic
civic leader.

1045
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:09,709
- Security, please.
- Three, I have a gun.

1046
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:16,315
Now I feel threatened.

1047
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:25,851
Hey, what do you say,
Rosemary?

1048
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:28,329
- Oh, hi, Stef.
- Hi.

1049
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:30,889
- I'm sorry, I, uh...
- ( pool balls clacking )

1050
00:59:30,934 --> 00:59:32,162
We already made our bets.

1051
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:34,601
Hey, Czyprynski.

1052
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:36,264
Here to get a bet in?

1053
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:38,604
Hey, look.
Irish guys in a bar.

1054
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:40,700
( chuckling )

1055
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,441
( sighs )

1056
00:59:45,481 --> 00:59:47,642
( grunting, thudding )

1057
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,482
( moans )

1058
00:59:56,292 --> 00:59:59,227
Your time's up already.
O'Leary wants you gone.

1059
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:04,024
Stupid Polack.

1060
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:10,031
Then he said,
"That house?

1061
01:00:10,073 --> 01:00:13,201
That house sounds
perfectly safe to me."

1062
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:14,539
And that was that.

1063
01:00:14,577 --> 01:00:16,442
L-- I put on my clothes
and I went home.

1064
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:26,081
Here's to granting others
the serenity to change

1065
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:28,454
the things
you cannot accept.

1066
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:32,450
And the courage to accept large amounts
of change serenely.

1067
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:34,190
And the wisdom
to know the difference.

1068
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:36,255
- Laurel: Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

1069
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:41,398
You did this sober, Frank.

1070
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:43,405
Did a really good job.
I'm proud of you.

1071
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:45,839
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1072
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:50,571
Now all you have to do is keep it up
for the rest of your life.

1073
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:56,942
So, how's it
going with her?

1074
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:59,887
- She's still here.
- Yeah.

1075
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:02,413
Well, it's getting late.
If I'm not on the bridge by 11:00,

1076
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:04,517
got to work
the truck lane, so...

1077
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,619
Can I, uh,
catch a ride with you?

1078
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:09,063
Sure. Just got to
use the bathroom.

1079
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:12,526
You're not staying?

1080
01:01:12,568 --> 01:01:14,001
L-- I don't think I should.

1081
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:17,404
L-- it's not because
I disapprove

1082
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,431
of what you did today.

1083
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:21,204
But you don't approve
so much you want to stay.

1084
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:24,407
Oh, I want to stay.

1085
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:26,938
It's just I've kind of
been accused

1086
01:01:26,983 --> 01:01:28,541
in the past of losing
my boundaries.

1087
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:30,347
Which boundaries are those?

1088
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:32,013
You name 'em,
I've lost 'em.

1089
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:34,182
Remember the word "no"
means nothing to me.

1090
01:01:34,223 --> 01:01:36,020
Am I saying no?

1091
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:42,692
You're getting better,
Frank.

1092
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:45,428
I need to make sure
I am too.

1093
01:01:45,468 --> 01:01:47,698
Baby, I know
what you mean.

1094
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:49,796
Tom:
Well, all right.

1095
01:01:51,307 --> 01:01:53,366
Thanks, Frank.
See you later.

1096
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:55,570
- Okay.
- Okay.

1097
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:02,141
( chuckles )

1098
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:23,463
- Hi, Doris.
- Oh, Jeez-- son of a bitch!

1099
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:25,030
What the hell
are you doing?

1100
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:27,269
Working on being alone.

1101
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:29,141
Well, work on it
someplace else.

1102
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:31,578
Supposed to be
a part-time job.

1103
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:33,514
Come here.

1104
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:52,961
If I'm gonna be
working this late,

1105
01:02:53,002 --> 01:02:56,460
he's not the only
one getting embalmed.

1106
01:02:56,506 --> 01:02:58,235
This is it, isn't it?

1107
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:00,105
What is?

1108
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:02,907
No matter what you do,
you know, no matter how good you are

1109
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:04,845
you die.

1110
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:08,407
Then there's
nobody else around.

1111
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:09,941
Well, he's not
exactly gonna be

1112
01:03:09,986 --> 01:03:11,647
washing himself,
now is he?

1113
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:16,519
Hey, get the hell
out of here.

1114
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,390
I don't need you
getting all freaky on me

1115
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:19,951
- in the middle of the night.
- Sorry.

1116
01:03:19,996 --> 01:03:22,624
Just go be alone
with somebody else.

1117
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,507
- Hey, thanks for the drinks.
- No worries, man.

1118
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:41,414
Feel like
getting one more?

1119
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:43,441
( chattering )

1120
01:03:57,934 --> 01:04:00,664
( knocking )

1121
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,229
- It's Roman.
- ( door opens )

1122
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:13,676
Stef:
How'd it go?

1123
01:04:13,716 --> 01:04:15,513
I talked to Spiros
and his brother.

1124
01:04:15,551 --> 01:04:19,043
They said if they wanted to back a
losing team, they'd buy the Sabres.

1125
01:04:19,088 --> 01:04:22,216
- Fucking Greeks.
- Roman: Hey, they gave us democracy.

1126
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,823
You're gonna ruin
your eyes in this light.

1127
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:29,662
Stef.

1128
01:04:32,134 --> 01:04:35,160
We're gonna come out
on the other side of this.

1129
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,297
I'm gonna fix it.

1130
01:04:38,774 --> 01:04:41,402
Okay?

1131
01:04:41,444 --> 01:04:44,379
Dave: Money's no good here!
I'm the King of Nob Hill!

1132
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:45,880
( crowd chuckling )

1133
01:04:45,915 --> 01:04:48,349
And half of North Beach!

1134
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:50,818
How did that happen?

1135
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:57,116
Mmm. Mmm.

1136
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:11,440
What do you say, Franklin?

1137
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:14,433
Uh, another one
down here, hmm.

1138
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,610
( sighs )

1139
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:23,113
You did me a huge
favor today, Frank.

1140
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:31,721
Maybe you ought to
come hang with us.

1141
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,661
You know, meet some
of the guys and--

1142
01:05:33,696 --> 01:05:35,323
You need to shut up now.

1143
01:05:37,867 --> 01:05:39,334
Yeah.

1144
01:05:39,368 --> 01:05:41,962
You know--
you know, you're...

1145
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:43,904
a loser, Frank.

1146
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:46,699
It-- it's just--

1147
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:50,803
what's it like to have absolutely
no self-control, hmm?

1148
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:53,508
In real estate,
you learn to expect

1149
01:05:53,549 --> 01:05:55,847
a certain amount
of natural resistance.

1150
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,915
That's the part I like--

1151
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:02,117
breaking their wills.

1152
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:05,123
But with you,
what did it take?

1153
01:06:06,996 --> 01:06:08,463
Me asking.

1154
01:06:08,497 --> 01:06:10,590
You do what
you're told, Frank.

1155
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:12,760
You're a victim.
You let people fuck you.

1156
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:15,293
I'm gonna drink
this drink.

1157
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:16,862
And when I'm finished,

1158
01:06:16,906 --> 01:06:18,965
do not be in this bar.

1159
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:23,205
Oh.

1160
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:26,442
You're not the only guy
in town with a gun, Frank.

1161
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:28,507
Hey.

1162
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,309
Keep 'em coming.

1163
01:06:38,527 --> 01:06:41,052
- You got any food?
- Check the fridge.

1164
01:06:41,097 --> 01:06:43,190
Pam made a whole
thing of golumpki.

1165
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,730
Henry, go get some food!

1166
01:06:58,381 --> 01:07:00,110
( keys jangling )

1167
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:07,144
( phone ringing )

1168
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:10,448
Hello?

1169
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:20,767
It's him.

1170
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:28,674
- Yeah.
- O'Leary: Hey hey, Roman, it's me.

1171
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:30,872
L-- I just thought
I'd call and say good night.

1172
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:35,009
Yeah.

1173
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,541
Good night.

1174
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:41,246
( dial tone )

1175
01:07:48,998 --> 01:07:50,431
All right. Stanley,
get the front door.

1176
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:52,434
Stef, get the back.

1177
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,130
( doorbell rings )

1178
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:10,076
It's Henry.

1179
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:13,681
Henry's got a key.

1180
01:08:21,697 --> 01:08:23,358
Come on in, Henry!

1181
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:33,531
( whispers )
Move.

1182
01:08:35,678 --> 01:08:37,339
( doorbell rings )

1183
01:08:46,856 --> 01:08:48,118
Here, I'll get this.

1184
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:50,751
Give me the shotgun.
Give it to me!

1185
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:52,920
You take this.
Check the basement.

1186
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:01,531
- ( thuds )
- ( grunts )

1187
01:09:03,405 --> 01:09:05,168
- Stanley: What was that?
- Nothing.

1188
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:08,204
I'm coming.

1189
01:09:08,244 --> 01:09:10,041
( moans softly )

1190
01:09:14,016 --> 01:09:15,745
( doorbell rings )

1191
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:34,826
All right.
Let 'em in.

1192
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:51,248
( groans )

1193
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:55,350
( gagging )

1194
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:10,800
You know, Roman,

1195
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:12,534
you could have
still plowed.

1196
01:10:39,868 --> 01:10:42,166
( sirens wailing )

1197
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:07,558
Shit.

1198
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:13,263
( phone ringing )

1199
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:31,953
Hello.

1200
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:34,114
Stef:
They're all dead.

1201
01:11:34,156 --> 01:11:37,421
- Stef?
- O'Leary shot Roman

1202
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:39,393
in my front hallway.

1203
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:42,757
Couldn't even
shoot him standing up

1204
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:44,356
like a regular guy.

1205
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:47,198
Stef, wait.
Go slower.

1206
01:11:47,236 --> 01:11:48,464
He hit me
over the head

1207
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:50,404
to protect me and--

1208
01:11:51,507 --> 01:11:53,031
You want me
to come get you?

1209
01:11:53,075 --> 01:11:54,702
No.

1210
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:59,170
Stay out there.

1211
01:11:59,214 --> 01:12:00,738
Live your life.

1212
01:12:00,783 --> 01:12:02,580
It's my fault, l--

1213
01:12:02,618 --> 01:12:04,245
I should have
killed O'Leary.

1214
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:10,985
Dave's voice:
You're a loser, Frank.

1215
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:15,486
Roman's voice:
I can't trust you anymore, Frank!

1216
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:20,726
Tom's voice:
The alcoholic's God

1217
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:22,600
is a very
forgiving God, Frank.

1218
01:12:27,443 --> 01:12:29,911
( slams )
God!

1219
01:12:31,246 --> 01:12:33,271
I could really
use a hand right now!

1220
01:12:40,055 --> 01:12:41,716
Dave's voice:
You do what you're told, Frank.

1221
01:12:41,757 --> 01:12:44,624
You're a victim.
You let people fuck you.

1222
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:59,705
Hi, you've reached Laurel.
Leave a message at the beep.

1223
01:12:59,742 --> 01:13:01,209
( beeps )

1224
01:13:01,243 --> 01:13:04,679
Laurel, hi.
You're sleeping.

1225
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:06,510
I guess that's
just as well.

1226
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:08,539
There's no way
to tell you this

1227
01:13:08,584 --> 01:13:10,108
that isn't gonna make me
sound like an asshole,

1228
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:13,087
but I'm leaving
for the airport

1229
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:15,022
and I probably
won't come back.

1230
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:18,384
I would have just hurt you.
Forget me.

1231
01:13:18,427 --> 01:13:20,327
I'm a joke.

1232
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:23,855
Find somebody better.

1233
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,662
There'll be
other funerals.

1234
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:28,461
I'm sorry.

1235
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:35,099
( jet engine roaring )

1236
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:41,748
So, uh, gonna find a meeting
when you get there?

1237
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:43,308
- Cross my heart.
- Okay.

1238
01:13:43,352 --> 01:13:45,081
Oh.

1239
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:48,050
This isn't the place
for this, Frank.

1240
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:50,285
I can't exactly
take it onboard with me.

1241
01:13:50,325 --> 01:13:51,815
What am I supposed
to do with it?

1242
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:54,055
Kill bad guys.

1243
01:13:55,164 --> 01:13:57,598
Crack walnuts.
I don't care.

1244
01:13:57,633 --> 01:13:59,225
You were kind to me.

1245
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:00,860
I want you to have it.

1246
01:14:00,903 --> 01:14:03,770
Thank you. I'll think of you
when I shoot something.

1247
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:13,312
Frank. What the fuck?

1248
01:14:14,716 --> 01:14:16,445
What the fuck
are you thinking?

1249
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:18,146
What are you doing here?

1250
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:19,779
Not letting you
get away with it.

1251
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:21,915
- With what?
- With being a pussy, Frank.

1252
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:23,788
I told you, I'm not
any good for you.

1253
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:27,220
Don't you think I have
anything to say about that?

1254
01:14:29,898 --> 01:14:32,093
I'm not helpless, Frank.

1255
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:34,329
If I'm getting screwed over,
I'm really quite capable

1256
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:37,236
of figuring it out for myself.
And the only screwing over

1257
01:14:37,272 --> 01:14:39,069
that I've gotten
from you so far

1258
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:41,337
is that bullshit message
that you left on my machine.

1259
01:14:41,376 --> 01:14:43,037
Laurel, I'm a drunk
and a killer.

1260
01:14:43,078 --> 01:14:44,841
And I still
want to be with you.

1261
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,575
Doesn't that spell
anything out for you, Frank?

1262
01:14:46,615 --> 01:14:48,378
I know what has to happen.
You can't be a part of it.

1263
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:50,544
Haven't you learned anything
in that stupid program?

1264
01:14:50,586 --> 01:14:52,053
You don't know
what has to happen.

1265
01:14:52,087 --> 01:14:54,385
You don't know shit
about how to run your life.

1266
01:14:54,423 --> 01:14:56,857
It's not that simple.
I saw you last night.

1267
01:14:56,892 --> 01:14:59,417
Well, fuck my boundaries.

1268
01:14:59,461 --> 01:15:01,986
You know, I wanted
to see you so I came.

1269
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:04,624
I almost killed you.

1270
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:07,726
I pointed my gun
right at your head

1271
01:15:07,769 --> 01:15:10,101
and I almost killed you.

1272
01:15:10,138 --> 01:15:11,833
You were gonna
shoot me, Frank?

1273
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:13,501
Somebody!

1274
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:15,066
It turned out to be you.

1275
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:16,737
I was drunk.

1276
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:22,673
Don't do this, Frank.

1277
01:15:24,887 --> 01:15:26,377
Sorry.

1278
01:15:33,295 --> 01:15:35,058
Hold on.

1279
01:15:35,097 --> 01:15:37,190
Boarding pass?

1280
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:42,362
Ma'am? I can't let you through
without a boarding pass.

1281
01:15:42,404 --> 01:15:45,373
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Ma'am.

1282
01:15:45,407 --> 01:15:48,376
Do I really look like I want to go
to fucking Buffalo?

1283
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:57,519
( sighs )

1284
01:16:20,108 --> 01:16:22,668
( toilet flushing )

1285
01:17:01,683 --> 01:17:04,345
( gasps, exhales )

1286
01:17:05,887 --> 01:17:07,445
Boo.

1287
01:17:09,725 --> 01:17:12,193
I used your toothpaste.

1288
01:17:13,929 --> 01:17:17,194
Stef:
The Chinese think O'Leary's a genius.

1289
01:17:17,232 --> 01:17:19,962
He's brought three legitimate
businesses with their money

1290
01:17:20,002 --> 01:17:21,765
in addition to taking
all our stuff.

1291
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:25,034
It-- it's like
we don't exist anymore.

1292
01:17:26,675 --> 01:17:28,336
We don't.

1293
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:32,811
They have one last meeting--

1294
01:17:32,848 --> 01:17:35,681
money, routes, shares,

1295
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:37,617
some serious
business talk.

1296
01:17:40,589 --> 01:17:42,955
It's tomorrow.

1297
01:17:47,095 --> 01:17:49,325
One day at a time.

1298
01:17:52,901 --> 01:17:54,493
Stef:
Did you find one?

1299
01:17:54,536 --> 01:17:58,097
"Living Sober,"
8:00 Labor Hall.

1300
01:17:58,140 --> 01:17:59,664
You want me to go with you?

1301
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:01,437
Not to that meeting.

1302
01:18:03,845 --> 01:18:05,938
Not to the other one,
either.

1303
01:18:06,948 --> 01:18:08,381
( car starting )

1304
01:18:11,553 --> 01:18:14,021
( car starts )

1305
01:18:33,975 --> 01:18:35,602
( chattering )

1306
01:18:40,315 --> 01:18:42,249
Earl:
Ray, how you doing?

1307
01:18:42,284 --> 01:18:45,276
Looking good, buddy.
Looking good.

1308
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,481
Earl: Jim, haven't seen you
for a couple of weeks.

1309
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:51,056
He's going to a meeting.
He's a drunk.

1310
01:18:51,093 --> 01:18:52,720
O'Leary:
Put two in his head.

1311
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:54,422
Got it.

1312
01:19:12,781 --> 01:19:14,476
( doorbell ringing )

1313
01:19:30,031 --> 01:19:31,692
( knocking )

1314
01:19:37,539 --> 01:19:39,769
( doorknob rattles )

1315
01:19:43,378 --> 01:19:46,006
- Earl, alcoholic.
- Frank: Hey, Earl.

1316
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:47,514
All:
Hi, Earl.

1317
01:19:47,549 --> 01:19:49,744
Earl: I see some new faces
here this morning.

1318
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:51,377
Let me go over
some ground rules.

1319
01:19:51,419 --> 01:19:54,183
We meet early
and we break early.

1320
01:19:54,222 --> 01:19:56,053
We don't have
guest speakers

1321
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:58,525
and we don't
have time for rambling.

1322
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,620
We're here so everybody
gets to speak his mind,

1323
01:20:01,663 --> 01:20:03,756
have a doughnut
and get on with his day.

1324
01:20:24,853 --> 01:20:26,411
( doorknob rattling )

1325
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:29,984
( knocking loudly )

1326
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:34,051
- Stay there!
- ( screaming )

1327
01:20:34,095 --> 01:20:35,562
- Get your hands up!
- ( muttering )

1328
01:20:35,597 --> 01:20:37,792
Don't move!
What are you doing?

1329
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:40,028
I can't--
I can't breathe!

1330
01:20:40,068 --> 01:20:42,229
( gasping )
I can't breathe.

1331
01:20:44,372 --> 01:20:47,068
I'm Ray and I'm
an alcoholic.

1332
01:20:47,108 --> 01:20:48,973
- Frank: Hey, Ray.
- All: Hi, Ray.

1333
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:51,376
Pretty big day for me.

1334
01:20:51,413 --> 01:20:53,904
It's Sherry
and my anniversary.

1335
01:20:55,584 --> 01:20:57,074
20 years.

1336
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:07,892
Well, l-- l--
I guess you could say

1337
01:21:07,929 --> 01:21:09,726
I put her through a lot.

1338
01:21:11,066 --> 01:21:12,693
She's been really great.

1339
01:21:12,734 --> 01:21:15,635
Hey, could somebody
get the curtains there?

1340
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:26,311
( clicks )

1341
01:21:32,053 --> 01:21:33,350
Shit.

1342
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:36,118
- Thanks.
- No problem.

1343
01:21:36,157 --> 01:21:38,819
Stef: I know you think
you know Frank pretty well,

1344
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:41,454
but there's probably a few things
you're not gonna want to hear.

1345
01:21:41,496 --> 01:21:44,590
Like that he came back
to Buffalo to kill Edward O'Leary

1346
01:21:44,633 --> 01:21:46,658
so he could stop him
and the rest of the Irish

1347
01:21:46,701 --> 01:21:48,896
from getting into bed
with some Chinese sugar daddy

1348
01:21:48,937 --> 01:21:51,633
and wiping your
family off the map?

1349
01:21:51,673 --> 01:21:53,402
Oh, and he's
a really big drunk.

1350
01:21:56,478 --> 01:21:58,070
Wow.

1351
01:21:58,113 --> 01:21:59,740
He's really opening up.

1352
01:22:10,325 --> 01:22:13,886
Earl:
Well, uh, I guess that's about it then.

1353
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:17,057
Unless, uh,
any of our new faces

1354
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:18,622
would like
to say something.

1355
01:22:18,667 --> 01:22:20,794
Earl:
Come on up.

1356
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:31,110
My name's Frank
and I'm an alcoholic.

1357
01:22:31,146 --> 01:22:33,205
All:
Hi, Frank.

1358
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:37,680
I just moved back
after a few months away

1359
01:22:37,719 --> 01:22:39,687
sorting out my life,
that type of thing.

1360
01:22:39,721 --> 01:22:41,348
I've had
a rough time recently.

1361
01:22:42,657 --> 01:22:45,524
I don't know if...

1362
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:47,152
coming home
is a good idea or not.

1363
01:22:47,195 --> 01:22:49,789
But...

1364
01:22:49,831 --> 01:22:52,527
my work
is here in Buffalo.

1365
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:54,330
I'm needed.

1366
01:22:55,704 --> 01:22:57,797
That part's easy to figure.
I can focus on that.

1367
01:22:57,839 --> 01:23:00,171
But the other part,
my life, I don't know.

1368
01:23:02,143 --> 01:23:03,701
It's hard here.

1369
01:23:05,046 --> 01:23:07,105
I'm not the same guy
who learned to be a drunk

1370
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:08,672
in my parents' garage.

1371
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:11,515
L-- I don't see myself
the same way.

1372
01:23:11,553 --> 01:23:14,249
I know now that I have

1373
01:23:14,289 --> 01:23:17,588
people I care about,
a person I care about.

1374
01:23:20,528 --> 01:23:22,086
Hi.

1375
01:23:25,033 --> 01:23:27,058
Hey.

1376
01:23:27,102 --> 01:23:29,730
I have a person I want
to have care about me.

1377
01:23:31,606 --> 01:23:33,335
I can't run away
from that.

1378
01:23:34,376 --> 01:23:35,934
She won't let me.

1379
01:23:38,313 --> 01:23:40,713
I guess...

1380
01:23:40,749 --> 01:23:43,843
what I'm saying is,
Laurel...

1381
01:23:43,885 --> 01:23:47,013
I love you.

1382
01:23:47,055 --> 01:23:50,388
I'm ready to spend my life
with you, whatever happens.

1383
01:23:50,425 --> 01:23:53,189
( grunts )

1384
01:23:53,228 --> 01:23:55,458
I love you too, Frank!

1385
01:24:07,675 --> 01:24:10,803
- It looks like James is here.
- I hope he turned up the heat.

1386
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:32,226
Come on.

1387
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:38,596
Can I get you
a drink, Frank?

1388
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:40,335
No, thanks.

1389
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:43,500
Nuh!

1390
01:24:46,247 --> 01:24:47,737
Get in.

1391
01:24:49,818 --> 01:24:51,342
Now.

1392
01:25:00,195 --> 01:25:03,164
- Here to kill me, are you?
- Yes.

1393
01:25:04,866 --> 01:25:07,096
Well, then you won't mind
if I get myself a drink.

1394
01:25:09,804 --> 01:25:11,863
You know, a guy
like me, Frankie,

1395
01:25:11,906 --> 01:25:14,033
I can't drink
out of the bottle.

1396
01:25:19,013 --> 01:25:21,004
You could pull an army tank
out from behind there...

1397
01:25:22,383 --> 01:25:23,850
I'd still kill you.

1398
01:25:23,885 --> 01:25:26,445
( chuckles )

1399
01:25:36,898 --> 01:25:38,058
Ahhh.

1400
01:25:41,002 --> 01:25:43,664
- You know I got friends coming.
- Come out from around there.

1401
01:25:53,748 --> 01:25:55,215
Are you good at your job,
Frankie boy?

1402
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:57,548
Didn't used to be.

1403
01:25:57,585 --> 01:25:59,416
Well, how about now?

1404
01:26:07,695 --> 01:26:09,754
( crying )

1405
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:17,634
Don't kill me, Frank, okay?

1406
01:26:17,672 --> 01:26:19,640
Don't kill me.

1407
01:26:25,313 --> 01:26:28,043
Well, it was worth a try.

1408
01:26:28,082 --> 01:26:30,516
You should think about getting
yourself into a program.

1409
01:26:30,552 --> 01:26:32,213
( laughs )

1410
01:26:40,795 --> 01:26:44,026
Well, I guess that--

1411
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:50,929
- ( glass clanking )
- ( thuds )

1412
01:27:40,555 --> 01:27:43,023
Emily:
Anybody here with one week?

1413
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:46,488
One month?

1414
01:27:47,795 --> 01:27:49,422
Six months?

1415
01:27:51,966 --> 01:27:53,991
One year?

1416
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:58,098
- Anybody celebrating one year?
- ( all applauding )

1417
01:28:24,966 --> 01:28:26,900
( hooting, cheering )

1418
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:38,336
( sighs )

1419
01:28:38,379 --> 01:28:41,177
My name's Frank
and I'm an alcoholic.

1420
01:28:41,215 --> 01:28:42,773
All:
Hi, Frank.

1421
01:28:42,817 --> 01:28:45,980
( jazz music playing )

1422
01:28:46,921 --> 01:28:48,684
# If you know love #

1423
01:28:48,723 --> 01:28:51,123
# Like I know love #

1424
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:55,721
# The sun don't
rise the same #

1425
01:28:55,763 --> 01:28:57,822
# When a heart sings #

1426
01:28:57,865 --> 01:29:00,129
# Like a moonbeam #

1427
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:05,128
# It shines on everything #

1428
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:06,834
# If I told you #

1429
01:29:06,874 --> 01:29:09,934
# I was so sure #

1430
01:29:09,977 --> 01:29:12,673
# I woke up and love #

1431
01:29:12,714 --> 01:29:15,512
# Whispered your name #

1432
01:29:16,584 --> 01:29:19,212
# And, baby, believe it #

1433
01:29:19,253 --> 01:29:21,414
# I could not lie #

1434
01:29:21,456 --> 01:29:23,253
# If I try #

1435
01:29:23,291 --> 01:29:25,418
# If you know love #

1436
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:27,951
# Like I know love #

1437
01:29:27,995 --> 01:29:32,489
# The birds don't
sound the same #

1438
01:29:32,533 --> 01:29:34,592
# With your sweet smile #

1439
01:29:34,635 --> 01:29:37,001
# Going on for miles #

1440
01:29:37,038 --> 01:29:41,873
# It warms up everything #

1441
01:29:41,909 --> 01:29:43,934
# If you told me #

1442
01:29:43,978 --> 01:29:46,742
# You were so sure #

1443
01:29:46,781 --> 01:29:49,716
# You found out that love #

1444
01:29:49,751 --> 01:29:51,912
# Had come to town #

1445
01:29:53,321 --> 01:29:56,154
# You don't second-guess it #

1446
01:29:56,190 --> 01:29:59,284
# If you know love #

1447
01:30:00,628 --> 01:30:02,152
# Cotton candy #

1448
01:30:02,196 --> 01:30:04,892
# And summer nights #

1449
01:30:04,932 --> 01:30:06,399
# String of pearls #

1450
01:30:06,434 --> 01:30:09,767
# And city lights #

1451
01:30:09,804 --> 01:30:11,738
# I would throw them #

1452
01:30:11,773 --> 01:30:15,231
# All away for love #

1453
01:30:16,377 --> 01:30:18,436
# Oh, yes I would #

1454
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:20,504
# If you know love #

1455
01:30:20,548 --> 01:30:23,073
# Like I know love #

1456
01:30:23,117 --> 01:30:27,383
# The words won't
sound the same #

1457
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:29,754
# I have stumbled #

1458
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:32,259
# I have wandered #

1459
01:30:32,293 --> 01:30:35,694
# And found
sweet happiness #

1460
01:30:37,064 --> 01:30:38,998
# Well, if I told you #

1461
01:30:39,033 --> 01:30:41,831
# I was so sure #

1462
01:30:41,869 --> 01:30:44,838
# I woke up and love #

1463
01:30:44,872 --> 01:30:48,205
# Whispered your name #

1464
01:30:48,242 --> 01:30:51,734
# Well, baby, believe it #

1465
01:30:51,779 --> 01:30:54,873
# If you know love #

1466
01:30:56,083 --> 01:30:58,278
# If you know #

1467
01:30:58,319 --> 01:31:01,846
# Like I know love. #

1468
01:31:06,627 --> 01:31:08,754
