But there ought to be one.

710
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:50,601
Maybe, son. Maybe there should be one.

711
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:54,371
I'll research the law.

712
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:57,708
I'm taking this under advisement for 20 days.

714
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:03,814
Chrissy, what are you doing?

715
00:48:03,847 --> 00:48:05,816
What, are you kidding? This is national news.

716
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:08,552
You know, this is the kind of case that could take someone like Carter Evans,

717
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:10,454
Georgia's youngest prosecutor,

718
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:13,824
and most active bachelor, I might add, to the Supreme Court.

719
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:19,630
Get me a crew down to the courthouse. I need it fast.

720
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:23,233
Whether the inadvertent abortion of a local woman during a suicide attempt

721
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:26,103
can constitute criminal action under the law...

722
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:29,273
I see our County Prosecutor, Carter Evans. Mr. Evans? Chrissy.

723
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:31,074
I know you've been following this matter,

724
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:33,243
I wonder if we could solicit your legal opinion.

725
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:35,579
Well, Chrissy, as you know, our office is not involved in this action.

726
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:38,081
This is solely a matter between husband and wife.

727
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:40,017
However, I will say that, as an issue,

728
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:42,753
abortion is one that will not just go away.

729
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:45,355
I calls into question our most fundamental beliefs.

730
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:49,259
Our values and our emotions. And I have come to believe that abortion is

731
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:51,762
abhorrent to a large sector of our public.

732
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:53,830
However, Mr. Evans,

733
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:57,768
there is a public committed to protecting the integrity of a woman's control over her body.

734
00:48:57,801 --> 00:48:59,770
Indeed, and let me say that until the great state of Georgia

735
00:48:59,803 --> 00:49:03,540
enacts new legislation, and the nation's highest court upholds it,

736
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:05,542
then, in this land, Roe v. Wade is still the law,

737
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:08,211
which does means that abortions are legal.

738

760

It's a good issue. It's family-oriented and all,

761
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:12,943
but where did you take your poll, Newnan?

762
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:14,411
Where else?

00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:18,081
Everyone around here wants to nail the Jackson woman,

but what about the rest of the state?

Doesn't matter.

766
00:50:21,818 --> 00:50:25,889
What is really important is that people are starting to talk about Carter Evans.

I need to?

773
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:44,941
I know what you mean, Forest. It's a great idea.

So it is no more Jackson v. Jackson.

It's The State v. Bonnie Jackson. That's exciting.

I'd have to get our friends in the statehouse to let me run with it.

the Supreme Court saw the wisdom of returning to each state some rights in regard to

787
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:43,867
the regulation of abortion, and in view of this solemn responsibility,

788

Good Evening. Remarkable developments in the Bonnie Jackson case.

County Prosecutor Carter Evans has intervened in the case,

793
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,353
charging Bonnie Jackson on four counts:

794
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:05,522
the unlicensed practice of medicine,

795
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:09,025
the attempt to commit suicide, which ended in feticide,

796
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:11,728
the interference with her husband's property rights,

797
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:16,867
and the failure to inform her husband of her intent to abort her pregnancy.

798
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,202
And it looks like the prosecutors of the case

799
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:23,773
are hoping to find a backdoor mechanism for recriminalizing abortion.

We have on our show tonight Mr. James Forest, the Assistant DA.

802
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:37,087
Mr. Forest, is it true that the District Attorney, Carter Evans,

803
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,155
is thinking of running for Governor?

804
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:41,591
Well, that's what people are asking him to do, Chrissy.

805
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:43,894
His popularity is soaring at the moment.

806
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:48,164
But I can assure you that Carter Evans himself hasn't decided yet.

807
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:50,333
Excellent. Well said, Forest, well said.

808
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:52,335
The polls show that Carter Evans is not yet a viable contender,

809
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:55,839
but people's opinions change, and so does the popularity of the candidates.

Will he make it?

because that's what's going to happen.

861
00:55:10,507 --> 00:55:12,676
You're going to have press, pro-life, pro-choice.

You're going to have idealists, opportunists and nuts.

893
00:56:36,793 --> 00:56:38,628
Why did you try to kill yourself?

894
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:46,770
I felt trapped. Like I couldn't see a way out, where to go.

895
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:51,074
I thought Jed would kill me if he found out.

896

903
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:22,105
these are unusual charges. These are unusual times.

904
00:57:22,138 --> 00:57:24,808
We believe that by undertaking this prosecution,

905
00:57:24,841 --> 00:57:28,645
we represent more here than just the citizens of Georgia,

906
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:32,682
we believe that we are here on behalf of a husband.

907
00:57:32,715 --> 00:57:39,022
And, by proxy, on behalf of his unborn child, the silent victim.

908
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:41,524
And after hearing all the evidence against Bonnie Jackson,

909
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:44,894
including what I am sure will be a most spirited defense,

910
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:51,034
I am confident that you will find that she is guilty of criminal abortion.

911
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:54,204
We will show that she was not merely attempting to take her own life,

912
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:58,908
but willingly overdosed with the intent to abort her unborn child.

913
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:02,445
And we believe that after hearing the laws of the state of Georgia,

914
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:06,216
in respect to the performance of abortion,

915
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:11,488
and direct evidence in regard to Bonnie Jackson's actions and state of mind,

916
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:16,192
that you will find that she is guilty of some very serious criminal charges.

917
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:21,664
Charges that, in this state, carry with them a mandatory prison term.

918
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:24,000
Members of the jury, we will prove to you

919
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:28,671
that Bonnie Jackson took medicine given to her in good faith by a family doctor,

920
00:58:28,705 --> 00:58:30,573
hoarded it, and medicated herself.

921
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:34,577
Not enough to die, just enough to abort.

922
00:58:34,611 --> 00:58:39,215
She illegally prescribed herself medicine, and in so doing,

923
00:58:39,249 --> 00:58:40,950
she committed a criminal abortion.

924
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:44,053
In addition, she violated her husband's property rights,

925
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:46,422
and broke a long-standing Georgia statute

926
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:48,725
that simply requires that a person be notified

927
00:58:48,758 --> 00:58:50,927
of a spouse's intent to end a pregnancy.

928
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,464
Now, ladies and gentlemen, I know that some of you might be tempted at first glance

929
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:56,065
to view this as a victimless crime,

930
00:58:56,099 --> 00:59:00,136
but I assure you that there is a victim, in fact there is more than one.

931
00:59:00,169 --> 00:59:02,305
Look at this man sitting at this table here.

932
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:06,209
This is Jed Jackson. He's a builder.

933
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:09,779
He works hard, he loved his wife, he wants a family.

934
00:59:09,812 --> 00:59:12,115
He urged his wife to take fertility medication,

935
00:59:12,148 --> 00:59:16,085
he dreams of the day that a child could be born.

936
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:19,589
And the one day he is suddenly confronted

937
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:26,329
by a so-called suicide attempt, and his dream of a family is destroyed.

938
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:28,598
A shattered ruin.

939
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:31,734
You see, this is a very important case.

940
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:34,003
It asks a question that our courts have ignored for years,

941
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:36,873
does a man have no rights when it comes to the creation of a life.

942
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:41,010
Is there no redress for a man

943
00:59:41,044 --> 00:59:43,313
when his wife, without his consent,

944
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:46,082
chooses to destroy a child?

945
00:59:46,115 --> 00:59:48,618

947
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:55,525

948
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:59,195
that the state, with your help, as responsible jurors,

949
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:04,567

01:35:46,974 --> 01:35:51,011
And I knew that I was pregnant.

1561
01:35:51,045 --> 01:35:52,813
MAN 1: Murderer! She's a liar!

1562
01:35:52,847 --> 01:35:55,249
(CHATTERING)

1563
01:35:55,282 --> 01:35:56,317
MAN 2: Let her speak!

1564
01:35:57,318 --> 01:35:59,120
WOMAN: Go to hell!

1565
01:35:59,153 --> 01:36:00,721
MAN 3: You killed your child.

1566
01:36:01,689 --> 01:36:03,491
I couldn't tell you, Lauren.

1567
01:36:03,524 --> 01:36:05,459
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1568
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:07,461
JED: Bonnie.

1569
01:36:08,329 --> 01:36:09,630
Jed, don't scream at me.

1570
01:36:09,663 --> 01:36:12,099
Bonnie! You, sir, sit down and be quiet...

1571
01:36:12,133 --> 01:36:13,767
Bonnie!

1572
01:36:13,801 --> 01:36:16,370
He never understood what I needed. He just screamed all the time.

1573
01:36:16,403 --> 01:36:17,638
Bonnie!

1574
01:36:17,671 --> 01:36:19,140
The only thing he wanted was a baby.

1575
01:36:19,173 --> 01:36:20,674
If you scream... Bonnie!

1576
01:36:20,708 --> 01:36:23,477
Bonnie! All he wanted was a baby.

1577
01:36:23,511 --> 01:36:25,646
(GAVEL BANGING) Bonnie!

1578
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:28,983
JUDGE: That is enough! ...what I needed. And I needed something else.

1579
01:36:32,319 --> 01:36:36,557
And there was someone else,

1580
01:36:36,590 --> 01:36:41,595
who was gentle with me.

1581
01:36:45,699 --> 01:36:48,736
And so I went to that person.

1582
01:36:51,572 --> 01:36:53,240
(LAUGHING)

1583
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:23,604
So I went to that person

1584
01:37:25,539 --> 01:37:27,741
'cause I was so lonely.

1585
01:37:31,278 --> 01:37:34,215
But I knew I couldn't have this child.

1586
01:37:36,083 --> 01:37:38,786
I knew that Jed would kill me

1587
01:37:38,819 --> 01:37:40,888
if he found out about this child.

1588
01:37:43,490 --> 01:37:46,460
And so I tried to kill myself

1589
01:37:48,929 --> 01:37:51,131
and my baby.

1590
01:37:51,165 --> 01:37:54,635
Come on, Jed. Let's sit down.

1591
01:37:55,836 --> 01:37:57,304
Come on, sit down.

1592
01:38:01,976 --> 01:38:06,747
Now, Bonnie, are you aware of the Georgia statute regarding criminal abortion?

1593
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:07,948
No, sir.

1594
01:38:09,984 --> 01:38:11,785
Do you mind if I read it to you now?

1595
01:38:15,122 --> 01:38:18,058
"A person commits the offense of criminal abortion when he administers

1596
01:38:18,092 --> 01:38:21,762
"any medication, drugs, or other substance, whatever, to any woman,

1597
01:38:21,795 --> 01:38:25,132
"or when he uses any instrument or other means upon any woman,

1598
01:38:25,165 --> 01:38:28,869
"with intent to produce a miscarriage or abortion."

1599
01:38:29,970 --> 01:38:32,606
Section B.

1600
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:34,842
"A person convicted of the offense of criminal abortion

1601
01:38:34,875 --> 01:38:40,814
"shall be punished by imprisonment of no less than one, nor more than 10, years."

1602
01:38:45,853 --> 01:38:50,324
Bonnie, in your own words, and for the record of this trial,

1603
01:38:50,357 --> 01:38:54,461
I must ask you to say whether anyone had any knowledge...

1604
01:38:54,495 --> 01:38:58,899
No. No, no one knew. It was my decision, mine alone.

1605
01:39:00,701 --> 01:39:03,337
So, the decision to end your life...

1606
01:39:03,370 --> 01:39:04,705
That was mine.

1607
01:39:06,573 --> 01:39:07,841
Your decision.

1608
01:39:07,875 --> 01:39:12,112
My decision. It's my life. It was my body.

1609
01:39:12,146 --> 01:39:13,781
And the life inside your body...

1610
01:39:13,814 --> 01:39:15,049
That was mine!

1611
01:39:16,884 --> 01:39:19,386
No woman could give that up easily.

1612
01:39:21,388 --> 01:39:26,393
But no one else should be able to make that decision for me.

1613
01:39:27,428 --> 01:39:28,429
No one.

1614
01:39:33,701 --> 01:39:34,702
Continue, Bonnie.

1615
01:39:37,237 --> 01:39:41,041
Do you think I could have given up my child that easily?

1616
01:39:41,075 --> 01:39:43,510
I was not ready to have a child.

1617
01:39:45,446 --> 01:39:48,382
I was not ready for Jed's child.

1618
01:39:48,415 --> 01:39:50,584
And I certainly could not have handled C. Ray's.

1619
01:39:52,553 --> 01:39:55,189
Maybe in another time or another place.

1620
01:39:57,257 --> 01:40:00,127
How could I have protected that child from my husband?

1621
01:40:01,428 --> 01:40:03,697
Or from the harshness of this town.

1622
01:40:07,935 --> 01:40:11,939
I didn't want to be pregnant then. It was an accident.

1623
01:40:16,143 --> 01:40:20,781
And I want children. I love children.

1624
01:40:23,584 --> 01:40:25,419
And I thought about having an abortion.

1625
01:40:28,455 --> 01:40:30,724
But I didn't want to do that, either.

1626
01:40:32,593 --> 01:40:36,096
It was the hardest decision I had to make in all my life.

1627
01:40:37,798 --> 01:40:41,902
So I decided to end it all because I didn't know what else to do.

Yes, we have, Your Honor.

Will the defendant please rise.

1650
01:43:01,108 --> 01:43:03,644
Mr. Foreman, will you publish the verdict.

1651
01:43:08,081 --> 01:43:13,387
Count 1, as to criminal attempt to commit suicide,

1652
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:16,690
we, the jury, find the defendant

1653
01:43:16,723 --> 01:43:17,724
not guilty.

1654
01:43:19,459 --> 01:43:23,764
Count 2, interference with husband's property rights,

1655
01:43:23,797 --> 01:43:26,767
we, the jury, find the defendant not guilty.

1656
01:43:29,102 --> 01:43:32,239
She's not her husband's property, she's community property now.

1657

Count 3, failure to obtain spousal notification,

1658
01:43:36,843 --> 01:43:40,280

01:43:44,284 --> 01:43:48,388
Count 4, unlicensed practice of medicine

to produce a criminal abortion, we, the jury, find the defendant

1662
01:43:55,662 --> 01:43:56,863
guilty.

1663
01:43:59,967 --> 01:44:04,338
Your Honor. Your Honor, I would like to be heard, please.

1664
01:44:04,371 --> 01:44:06,740
Sit down, Ms. McKinley. But something is wrong here.

1665
01:44:06,773 --> 01:44:10,477
Something is clearly wrong. I said, sit down, Ms. McKinley.

1666
01:44:10,510 --> 01:44:12,446
Does this mean that she goes off to jail?

1667
01:44:17,484 --> 01:44:22,089
Mrs. Jackson, you have been tried by a jury of your peers,

1668
01:44:22,122 --> 01:44:24,091
and they have made their judgment.

1669
01:44:24,124 --> 01:44:28,195
Before I pronounce sentencing, I want to say for the record

1670
01:44:28,228 --> 01:44:33,133
that I have lived uneasily with this case for some time.

1671
01:44:33,166 --> 01:44:38,538
Our country is so involved with this heated debate about abortion.

1672
01:44:38,572 --> 01:44:44,544
Ostensibly, the issue is about the question of when life begins and who should choose.

1673
01:44:44,578 --> 01:44:49,716
But the pro-lifers and the pro-choicers have been hurling every imaginable argument

1674
01:44:49,750 --> 01:44:54,888
at each other in an effort to gain new ground in their pitched battle.

1675
01:44:54,921 --> 01:44:59,893
They have thrown in morality issues, women's lib,

1676
01:44:59,926 --> 01:45:03,397
religion, family tradition and even racism.

1677
01:45:03,430 --> 01:45:08,235
And yet neither side has ever really listened to the other.

1678
01:45:08,268 --> 01:45:12,706
Tactics are escalating. The hatred intensifying.

1679
01:45:12,739 --> 01:45:16,877
We are steadily building toward another civil war.

1680
01:45:16,910 --> 01:45:22,015
Never has an issue so complicated and so sensitive

1681
01:45:22,049 --> 01:45:25,419
been so quickly politicized.

1682
01:45:25,452 --> 01:45:29,423
And never has the humanity behind such an issue

1683
01:45:29,456 --> 01:45:34,661
been so quickly forgotten, as though it were an unexploded landmine.

1684
01:45:34,695 --> 01:45:40,734
Now, as to the case before us, The State v. Bonnie Jackson,

1685
01:45:40,767 --> 01:45:43,704
Mrs. Jackson, I'm sure that you have come to see

1686
01:45:43,737 --> 01:45:46,740
that your misuse of prescribed medicine,

1687
01:45:46,773 --> 01:45:49,176
and of the confidence your doctor had in you,

1688
01:45:49,209 --> 01:45:51,745
caused a considerable amount of your turmoil.

1689
01:45:51,778 --> 01:45:55,048
Be that as it may, I want to give the both of you

1690
01:45:55,082 --> 01:45:57,884
an opportunity to rebuild your lives.

1691
01:45:57,918 --> 01:46:03,690
And with that in mind, I suspend sentence and fine you $1,000.

1692
01:46:03,724 --> 01:46:06,560
Yes! Judge, I got $1,000 right here. Jed, Jed.

1693
01:46:06,593 --> 01:46:08,528
Now, I can write you a check, and...

1694
01:46:08,562 --> 01:46:12,866
Sit down, young man, or I'll hold you in contempt of court.

1695
01:46:12,899 --> 01:46:15,202
Okay, okay.

1696
01:46:15,235 --> 01:46:16,570
I'll pay it later, then.

1697
01:46:17,604 --> 01:46:19,740
I just want to pay. Sit down.

1698
01:46:19,773 --> 01:46:24,544
Now, as to the performance of all other persons involved in this lawsuit,

1699
01:46:24,578 --> 01:46:30,484
and to the use of taxpayers' money herein, we can offer no opinion,

1700
01:46:30,517 --> 01:46:33,720
except that I can personally say that I have found these proceedings

1701
01:46:33,754 --> 01:46:36,823
to have been exploitive and outrageous.

1702
01:46:38,091 --> 01:46:41,161
Bonnie Jackson, you are free to leave.

1703
01:46:45,198 --> 01:46:47,567

01:48:41,815 --> 01:48:42,816
for you.

1727
01:48:45,085 --> 01:48:46,086
And we won!

01:48:48,822 --> 01:48:50,423
Did we?

1729
01:48:50,457 --> 01:48:55,762
We sure did! We won a victory for women everywhere.

You ungrateful bitch.

1732

Ungrateful? For what? For becoming a goddamn sideshow?

I begged you to settle, but no, you wanted me parading around there.

You didn't share with me the fact that you were balling C. Ray Thompson, thank you.

Next time you're on trial, why don't you get your dentist to help you!

Unless, of course, you're fucking him, too! Go to hell!
