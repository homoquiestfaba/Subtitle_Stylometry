1
00:02:33,494 --> 00:02:35,189
Is it bad tonight?

2
00:02:35,396 --> 00:02:39,196
Bad?
That's one way to describe it.

3
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,801
"Insane" seems
a IittIe more appropriate.

4
00:02:43,004 --> 00:02:45,097
He's breathing down my neck.

5
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,401
It's my opinion
we shouId get the heII out of here.

6
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,544
-Now!
-Noted.

7
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,711
CIean this pIace up
and Iocate our guests.

8
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,593
I just need to take the edge off.

9
00:03:06,794 --> 00:03:10,753
You know the routine.
I need you cIearheaded.

10
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,295
First things first.

11
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,595
Now, where is he?

12
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:24,103
Show me where he's hiding.

13
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,426
You said he kiIIed nine!
There's 40 victims here!

14
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:46,600
Nine when he was aIive.
He's added a few.

15
00:03:46,801 --> 00:03:49,565
Now where is he, Dennis?

16
00:03:59,714 --> 00:04:03,241
AII teams go to aIpha.
Bring in the cube!

17
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,283
Why is he named The Breaker?
Is he a truck driver?

18
00:04:09,724 --> 00:04:13,820
SimpIe foIkIore.
The IocaI coIor exorcising its demons.

19
00:04:14,562 --> 00:04:18,692
Or maybe it's because
he broke his victims into pieces.

20
00:04:20,768 --> 00:04:23,168
I hate being rushed.

21
00:04:23,504 --> 00:04:24,994
This one's different.

22
00:04:25,206 --> 00:04:28,073
-You'II get a bonus.
-With what money?

23
00:04:28,276 --> 00:04:31,837
After tonight you'II be surprised.
Get to work.

24
00:04:38,586 --> 00:04:40,178
CarefuI, Dennis.

25
00:04:40,888 --> 00:04:44,051
Don't get too curious.

26
00:04:45,193 --> 00:04:48,594
No! Son of a bitch!

27
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:53,093
How can you justify what you're doing?
It's sIavery.

28
00:04:53,301 --> 00:04:56,896
You are persistent, Damon.
And you, KaIina?

29
00:04:57,104 --> 00:05:02,906
StiII carrying around your quicksiIver
fIares and the IittIe magic book?

30
00:05:03,244 --> 00:05:06,736
You're not capturing animaIs.
They're human beings!

31
00:05:07,014 --> 00:05:08,413
Dead human beings.

32
00:05:08,716 --> 00:05:13,415
You shouId join Greenpeace.
Throw bIood on oId women's furs.

33
00:05:14,755 --> 00:05:16,848
Who are you to pIay God?

34
00:05:18,426 --> 00:05:21,725
-PIaying's for chiIdren.
-You won't succeed.

35
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:25,626
Not without the right speIIs
and the 13th ghost.

36
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,365
13th ghost?

37
00:05:27,568 --> 00:05:31,834
Get them out of my sight!
We've wasted too much time.

38
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:34,007
Why did he say 13th?

39
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,403
Move the cube into position.

40
00:05:36,611 --> 00:05:38,772
What did he mean, 13 ghosts?

41
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,575
You contracted me for 12 ghosts.
The Breaker's 12!

42
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,613
I'm done after tonight.

43
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:49,222
Yes, 12 and then one more.
I thought you were psychic.

44
00:05:49,423 --> 00:05:53,257
-That's not how it works.
-There's no time to argue.

45
00:05:54,128 --> 00:05:55,857
ReIease the bait.

46
00:05:56,063 --> 00:05:59,863
What bait?
We never needed bait before!

47
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:15,581
A truck fuII of bIood?
You've gotta be shitting me.

48
00:06:18,486 --> 00:06:20,147
Oh, boy.

49
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,817
Now...

50
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,922
...power up the cube.

51
00:06:36,404 --> 00:06:38,338
Start transmitting.

52
00:07:08,336 --> 00:07:10,031
Come.

53
00:07:11,105 --> 00:07:12,538
Come.

54
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,337
Come!

55
00:07:20,715 --> 00:07:23,343
Oh, God! HeIp me!

56
00:07:23,551 --> 00:07:25,212
HeIp me!

57
00:07:31,258 --> 00:07:33,123
Oh, shit!

58
00:08:00,654 --> 00:08:02,781
Where is it?
I can't see it!

59
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,458
Put him down!

60
00:08:53,674 --> 00:08:57,371
Hey, Cyrus. I hope you're happy.
You got your 12.

61
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:00,479
HeIp me! He's dying!

62
00:09:00,815 --> 00:09:04,182
Hang on, Damon. Somebody heIp!
Damn you, Cyrus!

63
00:09:04,485 --> 00:09:06,680
Somebody heIp me, pIease!

64
00:09:08,489 --> 00:09:11,117
HeIp me. Do something!

65
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,994
Oh, Cyrus.

66
00:09:21,335 --> 00:09:22,996
Oh, God.

67
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,870
Oh, Cyrus.

68
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,407
-Swing me.
-Come on, Bobby.

69
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:36,981
Come on, Kathy. Faster!

70
00:09:37,184 --> 00:09:40,483
-Let me get your arms.
-Come on. Try to drag me.

71
00:09:40,688 --> 00:09:44,055
You're the best IittIe brother.
I Iove you.

72
00:09:44,258 --> 00:09:49,059
-Come on.
-I'm gonna get you! I'm gonna get you!

73
00:09:50,865 --> 00:09:53,766
Look at them.
She's got him on the run now...

74
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:57,802
...but soon he'II be throwing her
over his shouIder.

75
00:09:58,072 --> 00:10:00,131
They're perfect.

76
00:10:00,341 --> 00:10:02,707
No, watch. Watch them.

77
00:10:04,211 --> 00:10:07,271
They reaIIy Iove this pIace.

78
00:10:14,021 --> 00:10:15,613
I Iove you, you know?

79
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:17,882
Surprise!

80
00:10:19,093 --> 00:10:21,061
My heart! My heart!

81
00:10:21,295 --> 00:10:24,526
-Happy birthday, Dad.
-Happy birthday!

82
00:10:24,732 --> 00:10:27,929
-Happy birthday, Arthur.

85
00:10:34,642 --> 00:10:38,373
-l love you.

86
00:10:42,716 --> 00:10:45,082

00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,730
Bobby, we have to get out.
Oh, my God!

93
00:11:02,937 --> 00:11:04,427
Jean! Jean!

94
00:11:04,772 --> 00:11:08,469
Mom압 still in the house.
We can앖 leave herhere.

95
00:11:08,676 --> 00:11:11,702
Bobby, go outside.
Go wait outside, now.

96
00:11:11,912 --> 00:11:14,676
You can앖 go back in there, sir.

97
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:24,581
l앐 sorry, sir.
She didn앖 make it.

98
00:11:24,792 --> 00:11:27,818
l should have gone back in.

99
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:37,465
Were here to honor the memory
and life압 work ofJean Kriticos...

100
00:11:37,671 --> 00:11:43,667
...a devoted motherand loving wife,
who was too quickly taken from life.

101
00:11:43,978 --> 00:11:48,847
Jean, you will be forevermissed,
but never forgotten.

102
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:52,246

108
00:12:19,513 --> 00:12:20,844
Dad, it's aI--

109
00:12:22,016 --> 00:12:26,510
It's aImost 8:30. Shake a Ieg
or you'II miss your first cIass.

110
00:12:26,854 --> 00:12:30,119
Today on Death in America:
Cancer rates are down...

111
00:12:30,324 --> 00:12:32,019
...but suicide is sky-high.

112
00:12:32,726 --> 00:12:34,751
We have a treat today.

113
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,954
A body was found, "decoIopoIated."

114
00:12:38,365 --> 00:12:41,198
Hey, hey. "Decapitated."

115
00:12:41,869 --> 00:12:43,803
Find a heaIthier hobby.

116
00:12:44,004 --> 00:12:46,199
Leave me aIone. I'm recording!

117
00:12:46,573 --> 00:12:51,840
Good morning, everybody.
Something smeIIs interesting.

118
00:12:52,046 --> 00:12:55,573
They found a headIess guy
behind Dunkin' Donuts.

119
00:12:55,783 --> 00:12:58,047
I Iove Dunkin' Donuts.

120
00:12:59,253 --> 00:13:00,584
-Shit!
-Kathy.

121
00:13:01,021 --> 00:13:05,048
Why not Iet Maggie make breakfast?
That's why we hired her.

122
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:07,591
Have you tasted her cooking?

123
00:13:07,795 --> 00:13:10,889
-Just that once.
-Hey, I heard that!

124
00:13:11,098 --> 00:13:14,932
-I cook better than you.
-We have to try to get aIong.

125
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,727
Okay.

126
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:20,838
TeII Kathy that keeping
a record of death is heaIthy.

127
00:13:21,075 --> 00:13:23,908
Keeping a record of deaths is heaIthy.

128
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:29,673
-She's being a IittIe sIut about it.
-Don't caII your sister a sIut.

129
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:32,909
-Thank you.
-I prefer the term "bitch."

130
00:13:34,555 --> 00:13:36,079
SIuts have Ioose sex--

131
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:40,090
Did you do your homework?
Because Mr. Peterson toId me--

132
00:13:41,228 --> 00:13:42,718
Damn it, Bobby!

133
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,626
I've tripped on that three times!

134
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,358
-Sorry.
-We need a bigger pIace.

135
00:13:48,569 --> 00:13:51,129
We don't have a big pIace anymore.

136
00:13:51,338 --> 00:13:53,966
This is the best I can do for now.

137
00:13:54,174 --> 00:13:57,507
So Iet's try and keep our shit
off the fIoor.

138
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:03,411
Now put away the damn tape recorder
and get ready for schooI.

139
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:06,618
I'm sorry, Dad.

140
00:14:09,022 --> 00:14:11,923
-Must be the Iawyer. I forgot.
-What Iawyer?

141
00:14:12,126 --> 00:14:15,994
-Isn't our credit cIeaned up?
-It's not about that.

142
00:14:17,431 --> 00:14:20,400
They won't make us move again,
wiII they?

143
00:14:20,601 --> 00:14:23,237
It's aII right.
Whatever it is, we'II deaI with it.

144
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,067
It's aII right.
Whatever it is, we'II deaI with it.

145
00:14:25,005 --> 00:14:27,701
-Mr. Kriticos?
-Yes. You're...?

146
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:31,071
-Ben Moss. How do you do?
-PIease come in.

147
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:35,681
-Is now a good time, or...?
-Good a time as any.

148
00:14:35,883 --> 00:14:39,717
PIease, just give me one minute,
wiII you?

149
00:14:41,822 --> 00:14:44,052
Okay. Sorry. I'm ready.

150
00:14:44,491 --> 00:14:47,824
I represent your uncIe
Cyrus Kriticos' estate.

151
00:14:48,162 --> 00:14:51,598
-We have an UncIe Cyrus?
-Had.

152
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:56,361
I met him a coupIe of times as a kid.
He wasn't popuIar.

153
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,800
Squandered the famiIy fortune.

154
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:03,066
-We have a famiIy fortune?
-No. Cyrus squandered it.

155
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:07,111
-Bobby, you have a Iate uncIe.
-What is he Iate for?

156
00:15:07,314 --> 00:15:10,044
-His next birthday.
-You mean he's dead?

157
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:12,715
-That got his attention.
-Pipe down.

158
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,514
Cyrus recorded this six weeks ago...

159
00:15:15,722 --> 00:15:19,021
...to be pIayed for you
in the event of his death.

160
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:31,366
Arthur, it압 good to talk to you.

161
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:35,502
Sadly, ifyoure watching this,
it means l am dead.

162
00:15:36,043 --> 00:15:40,742
Happily, that makes you
and your family my sole beneficiaries.

163
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:45,975
l았e instructed my lawyer, Mr. Moss,
to deliver the essential elements...

164
00:15:46,186 --> 00:15:50,623
...in my last will and testament.
Give it to them, Ben.

165
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:59,098
-A key?
-A key to what?

166
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,928
-A key to yournew house.
-What?

167
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:07,766
This house is the fruit
ofmy life압 work.

168
00:16:08,609 --> 00:16:11,077
Everyone gets their own bathroom!

169
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:14,805
-Is this for reaI?
-lt is a one-of-a-kind home.

170
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,449
lt압 my home, actually.

171
00:16:18,986 --> 00:16:20,510
My home.

172
00:16:20,888 --> 00:16:24,483
l have no complaints.
l았e led an interesting life.

173
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:27,751
l have seen some amazing things.

174
00:16:30,497 --> 00:16:35,025
My only regret is that l never
got to know my nephew, Arthur...

175
00:16:35,235 --> 00:16:38,864
...norappreciate the love
ofa family, like you have.

176
00:16:39,072 --> 00:16:44,032
This house is my attempt
to make up for that.

177
00:16:44,311 --> 00:16:46,040
Enjoy.

178
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:51,214
Perhaps we앏l meet again...

179
00:16:52,152 --> 00:16:54,450
...in anotherlife.

180
00:16:57,624 --> 00:16:59,717
-Wow!
-When can we see it?

181
00:16:59,927 --> 00:17:03,385
Whenever you Iike.
I'm heading there today.

182
00:17:03,597 --> 00:17:05,895
If you want, your wife and kids--

183
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:10,729
-Time out. I am not the missus here.
-My wife....

184
00:17:11,138 --> 00:17:14,767
-My wife is....
-Our mom burned to death in a fire.

185
00:17:14,975 --> 00:17:17,808
-Bobby!
-What? It's true.

186
00:17:18,011 --> 00:17:19,706
That's enough, Robert.

187
00:17:20,147 --> 00:17:24,481
Mr. Moss, just exactIy where
is this pIace?

188
00:17:25,018 --> 00:17:29,819
Just a coupIe hours drive from here,
in a town caIIed WiIIow Grove.

189
00:17:30,057 --> 00:17:33,823
It's in a gorgeous area.
Your uncIe Iiked his privacy.

190
00:17:34,161 --> 00:17:36,459
There isn't a neighbor for miIes.

191
00:17:36,663 --> 00:17:40,997
-Come on, hurry up.
-S-U-F--

192
00:17:41,201 --> 00:17:46,764
-Suffocate! I got it. I win.
-So what? You think you're so sIick.

193
00:17:46,974 --> 00:17:50,137
Come on, you guys. We're aImost there.

194
00:17:51,511 --> 00:17:53,376
-Excited?
-Yeah.

195
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,311
-Mom wouId have freaked over this.
-Yeah.

196
00:17:57,985 --> 00:18:01,716
Looks Iike things are starting
to get better, right?

197
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,783
Yeah.

198
00:19:27,074 --> 00:19:29,008
That's strange.

199
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:34,745
Dad, it's beautifuI!

200
00:19:35,482 --> 00:19:39,145
My God!
I've never seen anything Iike it.

201
00:19:41,822 --> 00:19:45,952
CooI! So "futuroic."

202
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:56,194
About time someone showed up.
This your pIace?

203
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:59,236
-Who are you?
-I'm the power guy.

204
00:20:00,707 --> 00:20:02,436
Don't touch.

205
00:20:02,642 --> 00:20:06,669
Your house is knocking out the power
of the whoIe area.

206
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,905
I need to check the breakers.

207
00:20:09,216 --> 00:20:11,707
CouId you come back tomorrow?

208
00:20:11,918 --> 00:20:13,545
Tomorrow? Let me see.

209
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:17,554
There's about 5570 houses
right now without power.

210
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:22,593
-My bosses kind of frown on that.
-That's not reaIIy our probIem, is it?

211
00:20:24,931 --> 00:20:30,130
I've been at this job for three weeks.
Can't you give me a break here?

212
00:20:30,337 --> 00:20:33,568
Sure. No probIem.

213
00:20:34,508 --> 00:20:36,339
Thank you.

214
00:20:36,877 --> 00:20:40,040
-Mr...?
-Kriticos. Arthur Kriticos.

215
00:20:41,948 --> 00:20:44,314
Quite a pIace you've got.

216
00:20:44,518 --> 00:20:47,248
Yeah. We're moving in.

217
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,752
WeII, one step at a time.

218
00:21:07,073 --> 00:21:09,439
-That's odd.
-Dad, you broke it!

219
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,307
Give it a rest.

220
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,409
HeIIo.

221
00:21:18,952 --> 00:21:22,547
Wow! You can see right through it.

222
00:21:22,856 --> 00:21:26,883
-You guys couIdn't afford waIIs?
-How weird.

223
00:21:27,093 --> 00:21:30,062
Guess Cyrus wasn't too keen
on privacy.

224
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:33,660
I sure hope the bathroom's
in the basement.

225
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,942
It's Iike a fun house.

226
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,938
It's Latin.

227
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,715
Everything's so beautifuI.

228
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:39,627
Just so we're aII cIear,
Miss Maggie does not do windows.

229
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:41,863
Wow!

230
00:22:47,841 --> 00:22:51,470
What an incredibIe weaIth
of knowIedge!

231
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,048
-A samurai sword!
-Bobby.

232
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,683
In your dreams, paI.

233
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:06,851
-This stuff must be worth a fortune.
-Yeah, that occurred to me too.

234
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,903
Oh, Cyrus.

235
00:23:17,103 --> 00:23:21,540
You crazy son of a bitch,
what did you do?

236
00:23:37,223 --> 00:23:41,626
Goodness! It's Iike a cathedraI.

237
00:23:42,162 --> 00:23:46,428
AII right, first ruIe:
no throwing stones.

238
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,794
It's marveIous, isn't it?

239
00:23:50,103 --> 00:23:52,697
A Iiving work of art.

240
00:23:56,743 --> 00:24:01,612
As soon as you show me the basement,
I'II be out of here.

241
00:24:02,782 --> 00:24:06,878
I beIieve it's down the haII.
It's two doors on the right.

242
00:24:09,756 --> 00:24:11,815
Excuse me.

243
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,624
The construction is amazing!

244
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,894
I'm getting dizzy.

245
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:33,138
Don't touch anything. Okay?

246
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,874
At Ieast untiI
we get some property insurance.

247
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:42,282
Arthur, we have papers to sign.
Then I'II give you aII a tour.

248
00:24:42,489 --> 00:24:47,517
Great. You guys don't move
from this spot. We'II be right back.

249
00:24:47,727 --> 00:24:50,287
Dad, you're being overprotective.

250
00:24:50,597 --> 00:24:54,533
Yeah, of aII this stuff.
I know you guys too weII.

251
00:24:54,734 --> 00:25:00,104
Stay right here.
I mean it.

252
00:25:22,829 --> 00:25:24,763
What the--?

253
00:25:42,515 --> 00:25:45,609
Where'd you hide your money, oId man?

254
00:25:59,265 --> 00:26:01,233
Oh, shit.

255
00:26:02,068 --> 00:26:04,263
What the heII was that?

256
00:26:10,877 --> 00:26:14,335
Oh, no.
Oh, Cyrus.

257
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:21,584
Now I know I'm dreaming.

258
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:26,187
-Was Cyrus a hunter?
-You couId say that.

259
00:26:26,392 --> 00:26:31,523
Your uncIe was quite a coIIector
of many things.

260
00:26:38,538 --> 00:26:41,598
I've marked where
you're supposed to sign.

261
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,673
Okay, Iook.

262
00:26:44,177 --> 00:26:48,705
I didn't want to bring this up
in front of the kids, but....

263
00:26:48,915 --> 00:26:52,282
WeII, this pIace is beyond amazing.

264
00:26:58,124 --> 00:27:03,084
I'm just a math teacher.
The taxes aIone must be--

265
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:07,357
I have nothing set aside.

266
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:11,799
To be honest,
a fire took away everything.

267
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,701
Arthur, you don't need to worry.

268
00:27:14,908 --> 00:27:18,605
Cyrus was a genius
when it came to finances.

269
00:27:18,811 --> 00:27:22,303
None of you ever have
to worry about money again.

270
00:27:26,753 --> 00:27:28,277
You son of a bitch.

271
00:28:25,511 --> 00:28:28,036
Look here! Look, you aII.

272
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:31,376
Look, Iook, Iook, Iook!

273
00:28:38,324 --> 00:28:40,155
Sign.

274
00:28:41,361 --> 00:28:43,261
Arthur? Arthur?

275
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:48,526
Arthur, we've gotta--
Arthur, we have to taIk.

276
00:28:49,002 --> 00:28:53,871
-What is the deaI with the breakers?
-Nothing. I'm not the power guy.

277
00:28:54,073 --> 00:28:56,439
-I'm Dennis Rafkin.
-You're Rafkin?

278
00:28:56,643 --> 00:28:59,077
-Who's that?
-My office warned me--

279
00:28:59,379 --> 00:29:02,837
I know it's gonna sound whacked,
but stay with me.

280
00:29:03,082 --> 00:29:07,348
I hunted dispIaced spirituaI energies
with your uncIe.

281
00:29:07,553 --> 00:29:12,081
-I'm sorry?
-PK agents. Revenants.

282
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:16,126
Wraiths. Do you have any idea
what I'm taIking about?

283
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:21,063
That's okay.
I'II do this the easy way: ghosts.

284
00:29:21,267 --> 00:29:26,864
Arthur, I used to hunt ghosts
with your UncIe Cyrus.

285
00:29:28,007 --> 00:29:29,907
-Goats?
-Ghosts!

286
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:31,940
Ghosts, goddamn it! Listen!

287
00:29:32,245 --> 00:29:33,712
I'II race you.

288
00:29:33,946 --> 00:29:37,177
No, Bobby, this isn't the pIace for--

289
00:29:37,383 --> 00:29:42,377
Come on, sIowpoke. Is that your best?
My grandma scoots better than that.

290
00:29:42,588 --> 00:29:47,423
Ghosts, as in disgruntIed spirits
trapped on Earth. Ghosts.

291
00:29:47,627 --> 00:29:52,291
As in HaIIoween. As in Demi Moore
and "Unchained MeIody." Ghosts.

292
00:29:52,498 --> 00:29:56,059
Ghosts, right. Okay, I get it.
I'm scared.

293
00:29:56,269 --> 00:29:58,965
Don't Iaugh at me. Don't Iaugh.

294
00:29:59,439 --> 00:30:04,775
I'II expIain everything as soon as you
get you and your chiIdren outside.

295
00:30:04,977 --> 00:30:09,209
-What's taking you so Iong?
-Out of my way. Come on, Maggie!

296
00:30:09,415 --> 00:30:14,114
-You cheated. I didn't say "start."
-Gotta be on your toes.

297
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,347
This has to be my room!
There are toys everywhere.

298
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:22,286
-I wonder what my room's Iike.
-I'm in the cooIest room.

299
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,497
I'II be in here.

300
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,348
Wow.

301
00:30:43,816 --> 00:30:47,877
This pIace is awesome!

302
00:30:48,187 --> 00:30:52,146
Cyrus has containment cubes
aII over the basement.

303
00:30:52,358 --> 00:30:56,454
I don't know why they're here
and I don't want to find out.

304
00:30:56,662 --> 00:30:59,290
-So if I were you--
-WeII, he isn't you.

305
00:30:59,499 --> 00:31:04,869
This guy has been harassing my office
since your uncIe died.

306
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:09,007
Some rich guy passes away
and aII the nuts come out!

307
00:31:09,208 --> 00:31:15,078
-Next he'II say Cyrus owed him money.
-He did. A shitIoad of money!

308
00:31:15,448 --> 00:31:18,884
These are some funky-Iooking specs.

309
00:31:20,219 --> 00:31:23,086
-Do I Iook cooI, or what?
-Let me see.

310
00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:25,621
Wait. Cater to my ego first.

311
00:31:25,825 --> 00:31:29,522
-Maggie is the best babysitter--
-Come on!

312
00:31:29,729 --> 00:31:35,326
I'm Ieaving the big gIass house!
Grab your chiIdren. Do the same.

313
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,866
Are you aII right?

314
00:31:49,182 --> 00:31:51,514
Jean! Jean! Jean!

315
00:31:54,187 --> 00:31:58,453
-We'II get you some heIp. Okay?
-Don't touch me.

316
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,601
Oh, my God!

317
00:32:18,611 --> 00:32:20,203
We've struck goId.

318
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,076
-Easy.
-Don't.

319
00:32:32,892 --> 00:32:34,917
How's your head?

320
00:32:35,561 --> 00:32:37,222
Not good.

321
00:32:38,731 --> 00:32:40,096
Where's the suit?

322
00:32:52,245 --> 00:32:55,146
"Power guy." Idiot.

323
00:32:56,415 --> 00:33:00,408
-CooI!
-There better be a pair in my room.

324
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,250
Bobby, where are you going?

325
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:09,384
What are you staring at?

326
00:33:10,763 --> 00:33:15,257
Hey, kiddo.
He thinks I'm gonna duck.

327
00:33:16,502 --> 00:33:18,265
Nice tits.

328
00:33:19,438 --> 00:33:24,432
Jeez. What's the matter, honey?
Bad representation?

329
00:33:51,637 --> 00:33:53,798
Not bad for an hourIy wage.

330
00:34:04,483 --> 00:34:08,943
-It's time to Ieave.
-I'II take your word for it.

331
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:12,423
Kathy?

332
00:34:19,165 --> 00:34:21,133
Come on. This way.

333
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:28,072
Shit! What the heII? Kathy!

334
00:34:28,341 --> 00:34:29,501
Maggie!

335
00:34:29,976 --> 00:34:31,773
Bobby!

336
00:35:00,373 --> 00:35:03,831
I was just kidding before.

337
00:35:04,043 --> 00:35:06,375
A IittIe Iawyer humor.

338
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,012
Kathy?

339
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,813
Bobby!

340
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:47,175
Kathy?

341
00:35:48,421 --> 00:35:51,322
-I don't beIieve it.
-BeIieve what?

342
00:35:53,492 --> 00:35:57,690
-I toId them to stay here.
-They're kids. What did you expect?

343
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:01,388
Thanks, Dr. PhiI.
You check downstairs, I'II go up.

344
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,329
Bobby! It's time to go!

345
00:36:12,278 --> 00:36:14,269
Kathy? Where are you guys?

346
00:36:14,613 --> 00:36:16,342
Bobby!

347
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,610
l앐 sorry.

348
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,889
l앐 sorry.

349
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,953
l앐 sorry.

350
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:37,053
What are you doing?
I toId you to wait downstairs.

351
00:38:37,256 --> 00:38:40,521
Yes, but come on,
this bathroom is unbeIievabIe.

352
00:38:40,726 --> 00:38:44,162
Yes, beautifuI bathroom.
Now where's your brother?

353
00:38:44,597 --> 00:38:46,258
He's with Maggie.

354
00:38:46,565 --> 00:38:50,797
Was with Maggie. We were racing
and we saw aII the gIasses--

355
00:38:51,003 --> 00:38:55,099
You're supposed to watch him.
That's what I pay you for.

356
00:39:05,784 --> 00:39:07,513
Bobby.

357
00:39:10,923 --> 00:39:13,118
Down here.

358
00:39:13,659 --> 00:39:15,149
Maggie?

359
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:19,588
-Come on down and play.
-Is that you?

360
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:27,396
-Maggie! Stop pIaying games.
-Bobby? l have something foryou.

361
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,666
We앏l have lots of fun, Bobby.

362
00:39:30,976 --> 00:39:33,376
Don앖 come down, Bobby.

363
00:39:33,846 --> 00:39:35,370
Stay upstairs.

364
00:39:37,683 --> 00:39:39,344
Don앖 follow her.

365
00:39:41,353 --> 00:39:44,151
Down here, Bobby.

366
00:39:46,025 --> 00:39:48,323
Bobby, don앖 come down.

367
00:39:49,528 --> 00:39:53,225
Bobby. Around the corner.

368
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:57,498
-Don앖 come down here!
-That압 it, Bobby.

369
00:39:57,703 --> 00:39:59,500
Guys, I'm gonna teII Dad!

370
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,806
-Bobby!
-Bobby!

371
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:07,706
I'II find Bobby. You both get out.

372
00:40:07,913 --> 00:40:09,403
-But, Dad--
-No buts!

373
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:13,016
Wait in the car.
I'II be out once I find him.

374
00:40:13,218 --> 00:40:17,552
-Why are you freaking out?
-Just this once, don't argue.

375
00:40:19,224 --> 00:40:23,558
-What happened to the door?
-Son of a bitch!

376
00:40:23,762 --> 00:40:25,423
I can't beIieve this.

377
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:28,191
I'II break it down. Step away!

378
00:40:35,207 --> 00:40:40,042
Quite dramatic, but you're wasting
your time. It's aII seaIed up.

379
00:40:40,245 --> 00:40:43,146
-Weren't you in an orange jumpsuit?
-Don't.

380
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:45,044
SeaIed up?

381
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:50,085
What part of that code can't you
crack? The entire house is seaIed up.

382
00:40:50,289 --> 00:40:52,883
-There must be a way.
-I've Iooked.

383
00:40:53,092 --> 00:40:55,890
We'II Iook again,
after we find my son.

384
00:40:56,095 --> 00:40:59,223
-That's okay. I'II wait here.
-Listen...

385
00:40:59,431 --> 00:41:04,334
...I don't know what is going on here,
or who the heII you are.

386
00:41:04,536 --> 00:41:08,063
And my son is missing.
So untiI I get answers...

387
00:41:08,273 --> 00:41:12,334
...I'm not Ietting you out
of my sight. Now get up!

388
00:41:13,112 --> 00:41:16,377
AII right. Breathe.

389
00:41:19,785 --> 00:41:21,446
Did the Iawyer spIit?

390
00:41:28,994 --> 00:41:31,292
Bobby.

391
00:41:51,316 --> 00:41:53,113
Bobby.

392
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:38,992
Come on, guys! Stop hiding!

393
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,072
-Bobby!
-Come on out, paI!

394
00:42:47,072 --> 00:42:48,039
-Bobby!
-Come on out, paI!

395
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,641
-Stop screwing around!
-You're wasting your breath.

396
00:42:51,844 --> 00:42:57,077
This is ectobar gIass. He won't hear
you. It's shatterproof and soundproof.

397
00:42:57,282 --> 00:42:58,510
What are these?

398
00:42:58,717 --> 00:43:02,676
That's harder to expIain.
They're containment speIIs.

399
00:43:02,888 --> 00:43:04,617
Ghosts can't cross those.

400
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,619
-Ghosts?
-Yes, ghosts.

401
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,929
The supernaturaI reaIm has its
own Iaws. For ghosts, it's speIIs.

402
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:16,898
Either written or spoken,
ghosts have to obey them.

403
00:43:37,055 --> 00:43:41,458
-The basement is fiIIed with ghosts.
-In this basement?

404
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:46,324
Yes, this basement. If it was
next door, I wouIdn't give a shit!

405
00:43:50,335 --> 00:43:52,860
-I'II prove it.
-I gave those to Bobby.

406
00:43:57,809 --> 00:44:01,745
SpectraI viewers:
you can see the ghosts with these.

407
00:44:02,247 --> 00:44:05,512
-I don't see anything.
-They're Iocked downstairs.

408
00:44:05,717 --> 00:44:07,184
Dad!

409
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,420
There's more of those speIIs
on the fIoor.

410
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,555
Let me see those.

411
00:44:20,966 --> 00:44:23,457
Bobby! Come on out, paI!

412
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:29,004
Hidden barrier speIIs.
Why wouId he need more protection?

413
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:33,235
That's enough. This is not heIping.
Do me a favor.

414
00:44:33,445 --> 00:44:38,576
Stop the haunted-house nonsense untiI
we find Bobby and get out of here.

415
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:41,717
-Bobby, come on!
-Where couId he be?

416
00:44:41,987 --> 00:44:43,420
Wait, no, no, no!

417
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:48,519
Wait, no! What are you doing?
Did I just say...

418
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:52,185
...there was a petting zoo
downstairs? No!

419
00:44:52,397 --> 00:44:54,729
There are ghosts downstairs.

420
00:44:54,933 --> 00:44:58,733
Right. But you aIso said...

421
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:02,438
...that they're aII Iocked up. Right?

422
00:45:03,208 --> 00:45:04,539
No! No way--!

423
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,474
Listen...

424
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:11,572
...I'II make a deaI with you.

425
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:15,349
I'II pay you whatever Cyrus owed you.

426
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:17,449
If you just...

427
00:45:17,723 --> 00:45:21,750
...heIp me find my son.

428
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:36,605
UnbeIievabIe. Get out of my way.

429
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,778
Bobby.

430
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:04,162
Bobby...

431
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:09,736
...get out of the basement.
You need to go upstairs.

432
00:46:12,477 --> 00:46:15,037
You need to put on those glasses.

433
00:46:15,247 --> 00:46:17,477
Leave me alone!

434
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:22,712
That압 it. That압 a good boy.

435
00:46:27,526 --> 00:46:29,357
Bobby.

436
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,358
Bobby.

437
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:36,266
Go upstairs and find your father.

438
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:39,861
-Mom?
-Go on.

439
00:46:40,939 --> 00:46:42,770
Go upstairs!

440
00:46:46,044 --> 00:46:47,875
Go find Kathy.

441
00:46:48,947 --> 00:46:50,505
Watch out.

442
00:46:52,517 --> 00:46:53,541
Watch out!

443
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:55,946
-Bobby, come on!
-Bobby!

444
00:46:59,725 --> 00:47:03,422
You don't have to scream, aII right?
Just...

445
00:47:03,795 --> 00:47:05,456
...chiII.

446
00:47:23,915 --> 00:47:27,544
-This way.
-HoId on. Listen to me.

447
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:31,845
This wiII take forever.
This pIace is just too big.

448
00:47:32,157 --> 00:47:33,385
Okay.

449
00:47:33,792 --> 00:47:37,523
Kathy and I wiII go this way.
You two check down there.

450
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:41,358
-No, we shouId stay together.
-It's okay.

451
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:45,533
Go straight, turn around,
we'II meet back here in five.

452
00:47:45,837 --> 00:47:48,772
-Five. Back here.
-Five minutes.

453
00:47:48,974 --> 00:47:52,569
-And don't touch anything.
-I gotta go with him?

454
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:03,952
Let's go back to the ghost thingy.

455
00:48:04,156 --> 00:48:08,388
There are ghosts in the basement.
You can Iook for yourseIf.

456
00:48:08,593 --> 00:48:10,390
I can't see any ghosts.

457
00:48:10,595 --> 00:48:15,157
What the heII? Give me those.
Let me see. Why are these open?

458
00:48:16,168 --> 00:48:19,296
I was down here before.
They weren't open.

459
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:24,270
-God! I hate it when they do that!
-Do what?

460
00:48:24,476 --> 00:48:28,708
They wait tiII you put your face
to the gIass, then give you...

461
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:31,112
...a big, fat "boo!"

462
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,781
Don't do that!

463
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:40,117
See it?

464
00:48:40,892 --> 00:48:42,723
-It's, it's--
-A ghost!

465
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:47,125
Just Iike I've been saying aII night!
FinaIIy, a beIiever!

466
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:50,629
Ghosts are aIways around us.
Most can't hurt us.

467
00:48:51,069 --> 00:48:55,028
Most don't want to. Ghosts here,
ghosts there, no one cares.

468
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,640
There are exceptions, Iike this guy.

469
00:48:57,843 --> 00:49:00,971
Those who die vioIentIy
remain tortured.

470
00:49:01,179 --> 00:49:03,977
-That's aII they know.
-What's he doing?

471
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:08,479
I don't know. I can't see.
I don't have the gIasses.

472
00:49:11,089 --> 00:49:13,649
I've had it with this.
It's time to go.

473
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:16,324
-Now! PIease.
-Don't touch me.

474
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:18,823
WiII you come on?!

475
00:49:24,669 --> 00:49:27,502
Come on, ghost boy! Move your ass!

476
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:33,175
Dad, sIow down. We're gonna get Iost.

477
00:50:03,008 --> 00:50:06,034
Dad. Listen to me.

478
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:11,042
He's gonna be okay.
We're gonna find him.

479
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:14,545
So ready to Ieave this pIace.

480
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,245
-Oh, boy.
-What?

481
00:50:18,456 --> 00:50:21,391
-The symboI of The JackaI.
-What's that?

482
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:25,892
It's the CharIie Manson of ghosts.
If he's out, screw the kid.

483
00:50:26,097 --> 00:50:27,826
We gotta get out of here.

484
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:31,331
Maybe Rafkin was right.
Maybe there--

485
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:32,730
Kathy!

486
00:50:34,105 --> 00:50:36,699
Think about what you're saying.

487
00:50:37,642 --> 00:50:40,941
There's no such thing as ghosts.

488
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:58,020
Kathy!

489
00:51:10,208 --> 00:51:14,110
What is it?! I can't see it!
TeII me where it is!

490
00:51:14,312 --> 00:51:15,438
Get off!

491
00:51:18,216 --> 00:51:19,877
HoId on! Stay with me!

492
00:51:30,795 --> 00:51:31,784
PuII!

493
00:51:32,063 --> 00:51:35,055
-Who are you?
-Never mind! Just puII!

494
00:51:36,801 --> 00:51:36,901
Shit! Don't speak. Don't move.

495
00:51:36,901 --> 00:51:40,132
Shit! Don't speak. Don't move.

496
00:51:41,573 --> 00:51:45,236
Somehow, we got behind enemy Iines.

497
00:51:54,586 --> 00:51:55,917
Hurry!

498
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:57,485
PIease hurry!

499
00:51:59,624 --> 00:52:02,354
Hey, IittIe guy. How.

500
00:52:02,594 --> 00:52:04,459
-Don't tease ghosts.
-Shut up.

501
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:07,223
You shut up.
You keep pissing them off.

502
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:10,661
Go. Go, go, go.

503
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:16,667
-Maggie!
-What?

504
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:26,010
Where?
I can't see without the gIasses!

505
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:29,684
I can see.
And I think you shouId go this way!

506
00:52:31,122 --> 00:52:32,680
Go, go, go, go!

507
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:37,855
It's aII right. I've got you.

508
00:52:39,864 --> 00:52:43,027
-Look at me.
-Daddy!

509
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,196
It's okay.

510
00:52:55,714 --> 00:53:00,378
Who the heII are you?
And what the heII was that?!

511
00:53:00,885 --> 00:53:04,651
My name is KaIina Oretzia.
I'm a spirit recIaimer.

512
00:53:04,923 --> 00:53:07,721
-What?
-I free trapped souIs. Cyrus--

513
00:53:07,992 --> 00:53:11,325
Forget Cyrus and trapped souIs
for a second.

514
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:13,554
What are you doing here?

515
00:53:13,998 --> 00:53:16,831
Looks to me Iike I'm saving your ass.

516
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:21,833
Oh, my God! It's over there!

517
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,739
Give him your gIasses. Come on!

518
00:53:39,924 --> 00:53:41,255
Oh, my God.

519
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:45,585
UnbeIievabIe.

520
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:48,398
Another one of Cyrus' victims.

521
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:52,297
I hope to God the barrier speIIs hoId.

522
00:53:52,804 --> 00:53:53,930
Victims?

523
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:56,904
Cyrus Iiked to ensIave souIs.

524
00:53:57,108 --> 00:54:00,134
That's why I'm here.
I'm gonna free them.

525
00:54:00,345 --> 00:54:01,903
Listen.

526
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:06,209
I need to know how you got in here.

527
00:54:06,551 --> 00:54:09,577
Through an opening
when the house shifted.

528
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:13,781
-Opening where?
-It's cIosed now. It won't open again.

529
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:16,787
Let me show you. This is the Arcanum.

530
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:19,456
Many died Iooking for this book.

531
00:54:19,731 --> 00:54:22,928
A 15th-century astroIoger,
BasiIeus, wrote it.

532
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:26,160
He describes the making
of a machine...

533
00:54:26,371 --> 00:54:28,396
...that can see the future.

534
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,575
He wrote it whiIe
possessed by a demon.

535
00:54:31,776 --> 00:54:33,937
I can't beIieve Cyrus buiIt it.

536
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:37,444
BuiIt what?
What are you taIking about?

537
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,139
BasiIeus' device.

538
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:42,376
We're in a machine,
designed by the deviI...

539
00:54:42,587 --> 00:54:44,487
...and powered by the dead.

540
00:54:44,756 --> 00:54:46,314
Listen to me.

541
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:52,119
I don't give a shit about any machine
or deviI or BasiIeus...

542
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:56,824
...or anything,
except getting my famiIy out of here.

543
00:54:57,435 --> 00:55:00,996
I came to set the souIs
in this house free.

544
00:55:01,539 --> 00:55:04,337
You want heIp,
you gotta heIp me first.

545
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:07,769
Kathy, can you waIk?

546
00:55:11,616 --> 00:55:13,675
This can't be happening!

547
00:55:14,018 --> 00:55:16,612
-We have to Ieave.
-Not without my kids.

548
00:55:17,021 --> 00:55:19,182
Try teIIing him that.

549
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:26,856
Come on.

550
00:55:38,309 --> 00:55:40,539
This way. Come on, come on.

551
00:55:42,447 --> 00:55:44,711
Stairs. Let's go.

552
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:48,541
Go, go, go. You go, go, go.

553
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:52,049
It touched me!

554
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:54,051
Wait! The gIasses!

555
00:55:54,325 --> 00:55:55,986
You'II need these! Catch!

556
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:08,730
-Good job.
-Sorry.

557
00:56:16,281 --> 00:56:18,078
Perfect, another dead end.

558
00:56:18,283 --> 00:56:20,979
We found the stairs.
How do we get there?

559
00:56:21,185 --> 00:56:23,244
-Get away.
-What do we do now?

560
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:25,215
Get away from the gIass.

561
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:27,687
-Why?
-Just do it.

562
00:56:51,015 --> 00:56:52,209
GIasses.

563
00:56:58,556 --> 00:56:59,784
Duck!

564
00:57:00,224 --> 00:57:02,055
-What?
-Move! Go Ieft!

565
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:05,626
Do something!
We're running out of corridors!

566
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:08,455
Duck! Go right!

567
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:11,791
Get down!

568
00:57:17,241 --> 00:57:20,904
We go to the Iibrary.
It has speII protection around it.

569
00:57:21,245 --> 00:57:24,146
Okay. Where's that from here?

570
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,662
Can I reIy on you
not to get me kiIIed?

571
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,766
I guarantee nothing.

572
00:58:00,551 --> 00:58:02,212
See anything?

573
00:58:06,057 --> 00:58:08,491
-Anything?
-No.

574
00:58:09,894 --> 00:58:11,521
-Come on.
-Okay.

575
00:58:11,729 --> 00:58:15,096
You know, I think they're
just downstairs.

576
00:58:17,902 --> 00:58:19,870
Nothing.

577
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:26,606
If we get out of this aIive,
I've gotta get a raise.

578
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:29,012
That's a big "if."

579
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:33,339
Give me a fIare.

580
00:58:36,587 --> 00:58:40,421
What's wrong? Don't start
freaking out now. Come on.

581
00:58:49,767 --> 00:58:51,098
What?

582
00:58:54,272 --> 00:58:56,433
-Okay. What?
-Shut up!

583
00:58:56,707 --> 00:58:58,038
Give me the book.

584
00:59:01,779 --> 00:59:03,974
Just back up.

585
00:59:05,883 --> 00:59:07,544
-Go sIow.
-Okay.

586
00:59:07,785 --> 00:59:09,116
-Going sIow.
-SIow.

587
00:59:10,221 --> 00:59:11,950
Go! Go! Go!

588
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:13,621
Fast!

589
00:59:17,495 --> 00:59:19,019
-What?
-Who the heII?

590
00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:21,562
What are you doing here?

591
00:59:28,206 --> 00:59:29,798
Shit!

592
00:59:33,244 --> 00:59:35,712
Hey, remember me?

593
00:59:43,821 --> 00:59:47,951
-Thanks for taking your time.
-Down the haII, Ieft, then right.

594
00:59:48,159 --> 00:59:50,354
-Where are we going?
-Trust me.

595
00:59:50,561 --> 00:59:51,994
-Arthur?
-Trust her.

596
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:54,298
Okay, Iet's go!

597
00:59:54,499 --> 00:59:56,660
-Who is she?
-I'II expIain Iater!

598
01:01:03,601 --> 01:01:06,229
-What happened to Kathy?
-She disappeared.

599
01:01:06,437 --> 01:01:09,770
How do you Iose an entire famiIy
in a gIass house?

600
01:01:20,318 --> 01:01:21,376
Arthur!

601
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:26,322
KaIina, the fIare!

602
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:36,393
Get him! Go, go! Arthur, get up!

603
01:01:36,601 --> 01:01:39,832
This is not the time to be a girI!
Run! Go!

604
01:01:40,037 --> 01:01:43,598
Stop dragging your ass! Go, go, go!

605
01:01:43,874 --> 01:01:45,933
Go! Run!

606
01:01:46,277 --> 01:01:49,337
Now is not the time
to sit around, Arthur! Run!

607
01:01:49,547 --> 01:01:50,946
CIose the door! Go!

608
01:01:55,987 --> 01:01:56,554
Arthur, are you aII right?

609
01:01:56,554 --> 01:01:58,681
Arthur, are you aII right?

610
01:01:58,889 --> 01:02:01,858
God, what's going on here?

611
01:02:02,493 --> 01:02:03,926
I hate this job.

612
01:02:04,662 --> 01:02:07,392
They don't Iike you either.
I wonder why.

613
01:02:10,401 --> 01:02:12,062
You got something to say?

614
01:02:12,403 --> 01:02:15,497
Let's start with:
This is aII your fauIt!

615
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:18,402
You caught them, now we're running.

616
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:20,338
His uncIe buiIt the house!

617
01:02:20,544 --> 01:02:25,572
You heIped him. How couId you
without knowing what he was doing?

618
01:02:29,086 --> 01:02:31,714
-I had my reasons.
-Money, you parasite.

619
01:02:31,922 --> 01:02:35,517
You stoIe peopIe's souIs for money!
That's depraved!

620
01:02:35,726 --> 01:02:38,718
If you haven't noticed,
I'm a bit of a freak!

621
01:02:38,929 --> 01:02:42,262
I go near anything dead,
I go into seizures.

622
01:02:42,533 --> 01:02:47,368
I touch somebody, and a whoIe Iife
fIashes in front of my eyes.

623
01:02:47,571 --> 01:02:53,066
So, yeah, I'm depraved. And Cyrus
is my friend, and he accepted me.

624
01:02:53,277 --> 01:02:55,768
He did not. You're so pathetic!

625
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:59,613
-He used you.
-Shut up, both of you.

626
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:04,254
Cut him some sIack.
What difference does it make?

627
01:03:04,889 --> 01:03:07,551
You didn't teII him, did you?

628
01:03:07,758 --> 01:03:12,889
-TeII me what? What now?
-About the fourth ghost.

629
01:03:14,865 --> 01:03:20,132
-No, don't do this. I didn't teII him.
-He has a right to know.

630
01:03:21,772 --> 01:03:24,206
What about the fourth ghost?

631
01:03:24,775 --> 01:03:27,869
St. Luke's HospitaI. Six months ago.

632
01:03:37,621 --> 01:03:42,752
You're saying my wife's spirit
is trapped in this house?

633
01:03:45,396 --> 01:03:46,761
I didn't know you.

634
01:03:48,299 --> 01:03:51,996
I didn't know her.
I didn't know she had a husband.

635
01:03:54,972 --> 01:03:58,931
Why? In God's name, why?
TeII me, why her?

636
01:03:59,143 --> 01:04:02,476
Cyrus picked them aII,
incIuding your wife.

637
01:04:02,747 --> 01:04:04,738
I've been trying to heIp you.

638
01:04:04,949 --> 01:04:09,249
You caII this heIp?! She's right!
This is aII your fauIt!

639
01:04:09,653 --> 01:04:12,178
-Son of a bitch!
-Arthur.

640
01:04:13,491 --> 01:04:16,585
You can save her. And your kids too.

641
01:04:16,794 --> 01:04:20,252
Just Iisten to me, and beIieve me.

642
01:04:20,498 --> 01:04:23,228
This house is not a house.

643
01:04:23,968 --> 01:04:25,367
It is a machine.

644
01:04:27,538 --> 01:04:31,609
It's a compIete and faithfuI
re-creation of BasiIeus' design.

645
01:04:31,609 --> 01:04:32,075
It's a compIete and faithfuI
re-creation of BasiIeus' design.

646
01:04:32,276 --> 01:04:36,178
There shouId be 12 spirits
trapped inside.

647
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:39,349
See these?
They represent the bIack zodiac.

648
01:04:39,683 --> 01:04:43,517
They are ghosts Cyrus needed to catch.
The First Born Son.

649
01:04:43,788 --> 01:04:44,982
l wanna play.

650
01:04:46,791 --> 01:04:48,156
The Torso.

651
01:04:50,961 --> 01:04:52,292
The Bound Woman.

652
01:04:55,132 --> 01:04:56,463
The Withered Lover.

653
01:04:58,536 --> 01:04:59,628
Jean.

654
01:05:05,843 --> 01:05:08,243
Bobby, l love you.

655
01:05:10,548 --> 01:05:12,311
The Torn Prince.

656
01:05:15,252 --> 01:05:16,719
The Angry Princess.

657
01:05:18,722 --> 01:05:20,053
The PiIgrimess.

658
01:05:21,592 --> 01:05:23,651
The Great ChiId and Dire Mother.

659
01:05:26,330 --> 01:05:27,558
The Hammer.

660
01:05:30,401 --> 01:05:33,893
And here, the sign of heII's winter,
The JackaI.

661
01:05:37,074 --> 01:05:38,735
And The Juggernaut.

662
01:05:41,245 --> 01:05:46,182
The machine required the energy
of these spirits to bring it to Iife.

663
01:05:46,750 --> 01:05:49,878
Then the spirits are reIeased
one by one.

664
01:05:50,087 --> 01:05:54,251
The house draws them to its
center. Each adds its energy...

665
01:05:54,458 --> 01:05:56,619
...powering it up.

666
01:05:57,094 --> 01:06:01,121
-Powering it up for what?
-To open the Ocularis lnfernum.

667
01:06:01,332 --> 01:06:04,096
-Ocularis, what's that?
-It's Latin.

668
01:06:04,602 --> 01:06:09,164
Ocularis.... The eye of heII?

669
01:06:09,707 --> 01:06:10,696
Very good.

670
01:06:10,941 --> 01:06:15,105
I'm stuck in a gIass house
with crazy white peopIe....

671
01:06:15,379 --> 01:06:16,403
Go on.

672
01:06:16,614 --> 01:06:19,708
In heII, there's an eye
that sees everything...

673
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:21,941
...the bIessed and the damned.

674
01:06:22,386 --> 01:06:26,345
If knowIedge is power,
the man who controIs the Ocularis...

675
01:06:26,557 --> 01:06:29,082
...is the most powerfuI on Earth.

676
01:06:30,327 --> 01:06:32,795
-Your uncIe.
-Great.

677
01:06:33,831 --> 01:06:39,360
So how many ghosts
have been set free?

678
01:06:39,570 --> 01:06:41,595
EIeven, and the house needs 12.

679
01:06:41,805 --> 01:06:45,502
No, Damon said something about 13.

680
01:06:45,709 --> 01:06:50,646
-There are 13 ghosts.
-The 13th ghost is a faiI-safe.

681
01:06:50,848 --> 01:06:55,410
To stop it, the house needs
a sacrifice of Iife, not death.

682
01:06:55,619 --> 01:06:58,087
A wiIIing human sacrifice.

683
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:01,248
A sacrifice of the broken heart.

684
01:07:01,458 --> 01:07:04,689
The onIy ghost created
out of an act of Iove.

685
01:07:05,296 --> 01:07:07,161
You're the 13th ghost.

686
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:13,158
The 13th spirit stands before the eye.
As it opens...

687
01:07:13,437 --> 01:07:16,429
...the spirit uses
the power of Iife...

688
01:07:16,674 --> 01:07:18,767
...to short-circuit the system.

689
01:07:19,176 --> 01:07:23,408
-Uses the power of Iife how?
-By Ieaping into the eye.

690
01:07:23,614 --> 01:07:26,981
And Arthur's supposed to take
this Ieap? No way.

691
01:07:27,184 --> 01:07:29,778
That's suicide. I won't Iet you do it.

692
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:33,683
Come up with something eIse.
That's not working.

693
01:07:34,191 --> 01:07:38,025
-Love is the most powerfuI energy.
-Meaning?

694
01:07:39,229 --> 01:07:43,791
To save your chiIdren
you'd have to trade your Iife.

695
01:07:47,972 --> 01:07:51,908
Let me see this.
There's gotta be a better way.

696
01:07:52,876 --> 01:07:54,366
I don't read Latin.

697
01:07:54,578 --> 01:07:57,672
WeII, we can try it
the oId-fashioned way.

698
01:07:58,082 --> 01:08:00,744
Nobody'II be here to brag about it.

699
01:08:01,018 --> 01:08:04,510
We need a pIan soon.
Time's running out.

700
01:08:04,922 --> 01:08:06,719
You gonna bIow the pIace up?

701
01:08:06,924 --> 01:08:09,188
The Iast ghost
is about to be reIeased.

702
01:08:09,426 --> 01:08:12,691
I know why you feeI
you have to do this.

703
01:08:12,930 --> 01:08:16,923
Psychics caII it a Iinking.
We Iinked. I saw everything...

704
01:08:17,267 --> 01:08:19,098
...about Jean, about you.

705
01:08:19,436 --> 01:08:23,463
Shut up. I'm not gonna Iisten
to this from you.

706
01:08:23,674 --> 01:08:27,872
-KaIina is taIking about suicide.
-Anything to save my kids.

707
01:08:28,078 --> 01:08:32,538
It doesn't make any sense.
There must be a better way.

708
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:37,778
What does add up here, Dennis?
How much of this makes any sense?

709
01:08:37,988 --> 01:08:40,616
Goddamn it. Goddamn it.

710
01:08:41,959 --> 01:08:45,451
AII I can think about are my kids.

711
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:48,894
I don't even know if they're aIive.

712
01:08:50,567 --> 01:08:53,536
Let's go out there and find out.

713
01:08:53,804 --> 01:08:57,240
WhiIe there's stiII time, you and me.

714
01:09:07,918 --> 01:09:09,249
KaIina...

715
01:09:09,653 --> 01:09:13,282
...no matter what I do,
or what happens to us...

716
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:16,391
...can you stop that machine?

717
01:09:16,593 --> 01:09:21,121
I got enough expIosives to bIow
us back to the 15th century.

718
01:09:22,433 --> 01:09:23,422
Okay.

719
01:09:25,836 --> 01:09:28,669
-How many fIares are Ieft?
-One. Why?

720
01:09:29,006 --> 01:09:30,337
We're going out.

721
01:09:30,607 --> 01:09:34,270
No fucking way.
You'II get yourseIf kiIIed!

722
01:09:34,511 --> 01:09:36,001
Not if we take that.

723
01:09:38,282 --> 01:09:43,117
We got 10 minutes tiII
the ectopIasmic shit hits the fan.

724
01:09:44,855 --> 01:09:46,516
Go, go, go.

725
01:09:49,026 --> 01:09:53,986
-We'II go down to buy you time.
-After you, Captain America.

726
01:10:05,542 --> 01:10:08,375
Damn, I just got my naiIs done.

727
01:10:08,879 --> 01:10:10,540
Here, put these on.

728
01:10:11,215 --> 01:10:13,649
Come on, Iet's go! Come on!

729
01:10:23,927 --> 01:10:26,157
Why did you leave me?

730
01:10:26,864 --> 01:10:29,059
Why did you leave me?

731
01:10:47,584 --> 01:10:49,347
There's no pIace Iike home.

732
01:10:49,586 --> 01:10:52,749
There's no pIace Iike home.

733
01:10:53,023 --> 01:10:55,014
There's no pIace Iike home.

734
01:10:55,259 --> 01:10:59,252
Knock it off, Dennis.
Just keep your eyes open.

735
01:11:00,030 --> 01:11:02,430
Sure hope I don't bIeed to death.

736
01:11:03,133 --> 01:11:05,260
That wouId suck.

737
01:11:07,437 --> 01:11:08,768
Rotate.

738
01:11:18,515 --> 01:11:22,281
-Is that haIf the Iawyer?
-Take this. Move it.

739
01:11:22,553 --> 01:11:25,522
Oh, my God.
He's definiteIy Iooked better.

740
01:11:57,421 --> 01:11:59,150
God. Shit!

741
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:03,057
GirI, hurry up!

742
01:12:30,921 --> 01:12:34,084
-Ram him!
-He's swinging for the fences!

743
01:12:44,201 --> 01:12:47,364
KaIina! This fIare shit ain't working!

744
01:13:21,838 --> 01:13:23,169
Where is it?

745
01:13:23,907 --> 01:13:26,239
Where is it? Where is it?

746
01:13:26,743 --> 01:13:27,732
KaIina?

747
01:13:28,245 --> 01:13:31,840
Why are you so mad at me?
I did everything you asked.

748
01:13:32,182 --> 01:13:34,241
I kiIIed Damon, stoIe his speIIs.

749
01:13:34,451 --> 01:13:37,511
I made sure your nephew
didn't get kiIIed!

750
01:13:37,754 --> 01:13:38,914
KaIina!

751
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:43,024
Where are the speIIs?

752
01:13:47,931 --> 01:13:50,661
You're not mad at me, are you?

753
01:13:52,069 --> 01:13:53,263
Of course not.

754
01:13:54,705 --> 01:13:56,400
-What is it?
-Oh, shit.

755
01:13:56,606 --> 01:13:58,096
Dennis?

756
01:14:04,448 --> 01:14:07,212
-OnIy room for one.
-What are you doing?

757
01:14:07,951 --> 01:14:11,853
I've wanted a reason
to Iike myseIf for a Iong time.

758
01:14:12,055 --> 01:14:13,079
Don't do this!

759
01:14:13,290 --> 01:14:16,555
Hey, bro.
You ain't nothing but a bitch!

760
01:14:19,062 --> 01:14:20,393
Dennis, no!

761
01:14:39,383 --> 01:14:40,475
Oh, my God!

762
01:15:32,636 --> 01:15:34,297
What do we do now?

763
01:15:34,538 --> 01:15:37,632
Arthur thinks he needs
to sacrifice himseIf.

764
01:15:37,874 --> 01:15:40,342
He'II onIy do it
if they're in jeopardy.

765
01:15:40,544 --> 01:15:43,342
-WeII, put them in jeopardy.
-What?

766
01:15:44,714 --> 01:15:46,705
-Why not?
-But they're kids.

767
01:15:47,050 --> 01:15:50,542
Greatness requires sacrifice.

768
01:15:51,221 --> 01:15:53,212
Now I have a job to do.

769
01:15:54,124 --> 01:15:56,058
And so have you.

770
01:15:57,894 --> 01:16:01,887
-Do it. Do it!
-Yes.

771
01:16:06,570 --> 01:16:09,300
And now to finish this.

772
01:17:04,961 --> 01:17:07,293
Oh, my God, Jean.

773
01:17:09,299 --> 01:17:11,699
I Ioved you so much.

774
01:17:13,637 --> 01:17:15,832
I miss you.

775
01:17:17,474 --> 01:17:19,101
Miss you.

776
01:17:19,809 --> 01:17:22,505
I'm nothing without you.

777
01:17:32,255 --> 01:17:35,782
No, don't. Don't go.
Don't go. Don't go.

778
01:17:35,992 --> 01:17:37,653
Don't go....

779
01:17:50,507 --> 01:17:50,607
Fetch the book.

780
01:17:50,607 --> 01:17:52,666
Fetch the book.

781
01:18:02,352 --> 01:18:05,446
Cyrus! Cyrus! What are you doing?

782
01:18:05,855 --> 01:18:08,187
You just can't teach some peopIe.

783
01:18:08,425 --> 01:18:13,362
I thought I toId you,
greatness requires sacrifice.

784
01:18:21,771 --> 01:18:23,204
-Kathy!
-Don't Iook.

785
01:18:23,773 --> 01:18:26,105
I don't wanna Iook.

786
01:18:28,044 --> 01:18:30,205
Kathy, I'm scared!

787
01:18:33,283 --> 01:18:34,944
Hey, Kathy!

788
01:18:35,819 --> 01:18:37,116
Kathy! Bobby!

789
01:18:40,323 --> 01:18:42,291
-Daddy!
-Bobby!

790
01:18:43,793 --> 01:18:45,624
Dad, heIp!

791
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,461
Oh, my....

792
01:18:57,574 --> 01:19:01,135
Make it stop, Dad! Make it stop!

793
01:19:17,494 --> 01:19:21,988
This house is not a house.
lt is a machine...

794
01:19:23,667 --> 01:19:26,033
...designed by the devil...

795
01:19:26,836 --> 01:19:29,600
...and powered by the dead.

796
01:19:32,609 --> 01:19:36,511
There should be 12 spirits
trapped inside.

797
01:19:39,215 --> 01:19:41,445
They represent the black zodiac.

798
01:19:43,687 --> 01:19:47,020
Each is a ghost
Cyrus needed to catch.

799
01:19:48,291 --> 01:19:50,191
-The First Born Son.
-One.

800
01:19:52,295 --> 01:19:53,956
-The Torso.
-Two.

801
01:19:54,197 --> 01:19:56,188
-The Bound Woman.
-Three.

802
01:19:56,466 --> 01:19:58,161
-The Withered Lover.
-Four.

803
01:19:58,368 --> 01:20:01,565
The Torn Prince. The Angry Princess.

804
01:20:01,771 --> 01:20:05,036
The Pilgrimess.
The Great Child and Dire Mother.

805
01:20:05,308 --> 01:20:08,800
The Hammer, The Jackal
and The Juggernaut.

806
01:20:09,379 --> 01:20:10,710
TweIve.

807
01:20:17,721 --> 01:20:19,382
You're the 13th ghost.

808
01:20:24,394 --> 01:20:26,385
If I'm the 13th....

809
01:20:42,078 --> 01:20:45,343
You son of a bitch!

810
01:20:48,418 --> 01:20:51,251
ReIease my kids, you bastard!

811
01:20:55,692 --> 01:21:00,095
Damn you! You're nothing, Arthur!
You hear? You Ioser!

812
01:21:00,597 --> 01:21:03,589
I dedicated my entire Iife to this.

813
01:21:03,933 --> 01:21:06,094
Every waking moment, for years.

814
01:21:06,369 --> 01:21:10,362
Have you ever shown that kind
of dedication? Have you?

815
01:21:10,607 --> 01:21:14,099
The worId has no time
for IittIe peopIe Iike you.

816
01:21:14,377 --> 01:21:17,574
It needs peopIe who are
wiIIing to do anything...

817
01:21:18,615 --> 01:21:20,583
...anything for greatness.

818
01:21:25,121 --> 01:21:28,921
You don't have a choice
this time, Arthur.

819
01:21:29,125 --> 01:21:31,059
You wiII make that Ieap.

820
01:21:32,796 --> 01:21:35,765
The machine requires
a ghost to be created...

821
01:21:35,965 --> 01:21:38,297
...out of an act of pure Iove.

822
01:21:38,501 --> 01:21:42,631
That's why I chose you,
you and your pathetic famiIy.

823
01:21:43,807 --> 01:21:48,403
CongratuIations, you get to become
the 13th ghost.

824
01:21:48,611 --> 01:21:49,805
Get on your feet!

825
01:21:54,584 --> 01:21:56,142
Come on!

826
01:23:02,051 --> 01:23:04,884
Trust me, Arthur. It's not over yet.

827
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:08,082
You can finish this.

828
01:23:09,325 --> 01:23:11,384
You stiII have the power in you.

829
01:23:12,896 --> 01:23:15,694
It's just a matter of how you use it.

830
01:23:15,899 --> 01:23:18,094
Go to your kids. They need you.

831
01:23:26,242 --> 01:23:28,073
Dad! HeIp!

832
01:23:29,245 --> 01:23:31,577
Daddy, don't! Don't do it!

833
01:23:39,756 --> 01:23:41,246
Oh, fuck!

834
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:48,920
Dad!

835
01:23:58,575 --> 01:24:00,406
Don't move!

836
01:24:03,713 --> 01:24:05,203
Keep your heads down!

837
01:24:07,550 --> 01:24:08,539
HoId on tight!

838
01:24:56,165 --> 01:24:57,996
Everybody okay?

839
01:25:00,503 --> 01:25:01,993
You okay?

840
01:25:04,841 --> 01:25:07,401
How did you know we'd be safe?

841
01:25:08,578 --> 01:25:13,311
I didn't. I just wasn't about
to Ieave you guys.

842
01:25:13,516 --> 01:25:16,314
I Iove you both so much.

843
01:25:28,197 --> 01:25:29,357
Mom?

844
01:25:32,702 --> 01:25:34,533
l love you guys.

845
01:25:40,877 --> 01:25:42,367
l love you.

846
01:25:54,991 --> 01:25:59,360
This is it for me! I am on
the first pIane back to Newark.

847
01:25:59,562 --> 01:26:06,126
I am sorry, famiIy, Kathy, Bobby,
