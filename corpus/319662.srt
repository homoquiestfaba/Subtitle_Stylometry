1
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:33,191
Are you ready to give up your own
lives forever, for the spices?

2
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,829
To never love anyone but the spices?

3
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,638
I am, First Mother. I know the rules.

4
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,315
Mistresses, I have taught you all I can.

5
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,913
We must now decide where you are to go.

6
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,918
<i>Paris.</i>

7
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,353
<i>London.</i>

8
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,713
<i>Nairobi.</i>

9
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,478
Los Angeles.

10
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,152
<i>Hong Kong.</i>

11
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,753
<i>Toronto.</i>

12
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,432
<i>San Francisco.</i>

13
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,756
<i>There's a need for you in all these places.</i>

14
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,869
You will not burn.

15
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,235
<i>You will not feel pain.</i>

16
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:49,193
You will wake up in your new home
free of all your own desires.

17
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,313
But if a mistress fails her duty...

18
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,278
the spices will punish her.

19
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,077
<i>I love being a mistress of spices.</i>

20
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,276
<i>The spices are my love.</i>

21
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,310
<i>I know their origins, colors,</i>
<i>smells, their magic powers.</i>

22
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,836
<i>Yes, the old, old magic.</i>

23
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,639
<i>Every spice has a purpose.</i>

24
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,952
<i>And for each person, there's a special spice.</i>

25
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,676
<i>I am named Tilo...</i>

26
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,069
<i>after the sesame seed...</i>

27
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,038
<i>the spice of nourishment.</i>

28
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,953
<i>But here no-one knows who I am.</i>

29
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,593
Ladyjaan?

30
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,238
Yes, Haroun?

31
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,880
Ah! Ladyjaan.

32
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,678
Ah, please!

33
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,308
I am sick of old lady Kapadia.

34
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,079
These rich Indians,
they think they're still in India.

35
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,037
They treat us like animals.

36
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,636
Do this, that. Drive me here, there.
Not even a nod of thanks.

37
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,757
Ladyjaan, you must read my fortune today.

38
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,869
Haroun...

39
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,428
- you know I can't read your for...
- Yes, but Ahmed said.

40
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,033
You helped him get a green card.

41
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,511
He was nervous before the interview, so I just
gave him some brahmi leaves to chew on.

42
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,434
<i>But he remembered</i>
<i>the Allegiance Pledge. First time, in English.</i>

43
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,399
That wasn't me. It was the dashmul.
The herb of ten roots.

44
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,074
Lady, you are just playing with me.

45
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,392
Look at these eyes.

46
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,675
You see these dark circles?

47
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,389
<i>Poor Haroun,</i>
<i>who came for the American Dream.</i>

48
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,233
<i>that now works for an Indian nightmare.</i>

49
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,390
Lady...

50
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,311
please.

51
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,034
What's this?

52
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,750
Oh, it's from tire irons and wrenches,
from Arco Garages, my first job.

53
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,229
And erm... before that?

54
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,117
Back in Kashmir we are boatmen.

55
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,636
My grandfather, my father and I,
we would row our shikara for tourists,

56
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,676
from America, Europe.

57
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,874
<i>One year, money was so good,</i>
<i>we lined the seats with red silk.</i>

58
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:20,313
<i>Chandan, the powder of the sandalwood</i>
<i>tree, that relieves the pain of remembering.</i>

59
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,439
Rub it in.

60
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,630
<i>One day the fighting started.</i>

61
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,871
<i>The soldiers arrived</i>
<i>and the tourists stopped coming.</i>

62
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,315
<i>The rebels came to take the young men.</i>

63
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,759
<i>There was blood.</i>

64
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,876
<i>Blood and more blood...</i>

65
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,919
<i>redder than the red silk of the boat.</i>

66
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,036
<i>I wish I had...</i>

67
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,792
<i>Hurry, now.</i>

68
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,030
<i>Faster, Haroun.</i>

69
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,031
<i>I wish I, too, had...</i>

70
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,950
What was I saying?

71
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,792
You wanted to know your fortune.

72
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,993
Oh, yes.

73
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,792
- It is good.
- Mm-hm.

74
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,233
Very good.

75
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,437
Great things will happen in this new land for you.

76
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,999
Um...

77
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,595
riches and happiness...

78
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,240
...and maybe even... love.

79
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,072
Oh, Ladyjaan.

80
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,559
Thank you.

81
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,036
I know you have the gift.

82
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,751
Thank you.

83
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,989
I must go.

84
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,278
<i>Poor Haroun.</i>

85
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,955
<i>I, too, was taken from home.</i>

86
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,912
<i>When I was born, my parents' faces</i>
<i>were heavy with fallen hope at another girl.</i>

87
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,231
<i>A daughter meant nothing more</i>
<i>than a dowry debt.</i>

88
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,435
<i>Maybe because I was left</i>
<i>to wander around alone.</i>

89
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,752
<i>I discovered I could see things others could not.</i>

90
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,355
<i>I knew which servant girl</i>
<i>was sleeping with her master.</i>

91
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,272
<i>I told a wealthy landowner</i>
<i>where to find his lost ring.</i>

92
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,755
<i>And I warned the village headman</i>
<i>of the floods before they came.</i>

93
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,713
<i>My fame spread far and wide.</i>

94
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,510
<i>And then the bandits came for me</i>
<i>to lead them to riches.</i>

95
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,070
<i>Mummy! Papa!</i>

96
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,918
Mummy! Papa!

97
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,116
Mummy!

98
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,596
<i>I did not know it,</i>
<i>but I had arrived at my destiny.</i>

99
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:45,550
<i>First Mother said I had been brought</i>
<i>to her to fulfill my duty as a mistress of spices.</i>

100
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:50,111
Don't you know it's very important that you know
what the names of these spices are?

101
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,591
Because you will be using them in your work
and you will get the power from them.

102
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,750
<i>Those are red chillies.</i>

103
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,239
<i>Red chillies.</i>

104
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,356
<i>Cardamom.</i>
<i>Cardamom.</i>

105
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,829
<i> Do you listen to the spices?</i>

106
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:08,836
<i>I was taught the power of the spices</i>
<i>and the consequences for breaking the rules.</i>

107
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,469
First rule...
you are here to see to the other's desires,

108
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,472
never to use the spices for your own.

109
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,308
Cardamom.

110
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,029
Second rule... you may never leave the store.

111
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,795
So there is no danger
of your straying away from the spices.

112
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,519
Is this turmeric?

113
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,795
Give it to me! Give it to me!

114
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,518
Ginger.

115
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,037
Final rule... you may never touch another's skin.

116
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,430
<i>Why are you warning me, chillies?</i>

117
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,109
Sister...

118
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,509
I was wondering if you could help me.

119
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,239
I've seen you here from the salon.

120
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,352
<i>Do you know how to do this?</i>
<i>My girlfriend says it's an Indian thing.</i>

121
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,148
Mehndi.

122
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,476
When are you getting married?

123
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,755
What's that got to do with anything?

124
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,558
Mehndi is normally done on brides.

125
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,915
I was just hoping to wear it to a hair show.

126
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,834
If I have to wait until I get married...
girl, I may never get a chance

127
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,992
<i>Saffron, for lonely nights.</i>

128
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,709
To glow, and attract love into your life.

129
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,791
What is that?

130
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,836
To give you energy for the long hours.

131
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,876
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, Myisha.

132
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,235
I'll see you real soon, girl. Take care.

133
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,639
See you.

134
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,359
You're cooking for her again?

135
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,908
She loved the coconut korma.

136
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,118
<i>Nothing like its delicate flesh to bind new hearts.</i>

137
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,668
- You ready for garlic now?
- I don't know about garlic.

138
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,594
- You see, me and garlic...
- Some religious groups in India never eat it.

139
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,875
That's what I'm talking about. That garlic...

140
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,191
Because they fear its reputation
as an aphrodisiac.

141
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,157
<i>You should try the eggplant bhurtha.</i>

142
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,597
You grill the eggplant over a flame.

143
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:00,680
Scoop the insides out
and then fry it with ten cloves of garlic,

144
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,673
cumin seeds, little red onions and tomatoes.

145
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,797
And you sprinkle it with coriander leaves.

146
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,792
<i>To feed your passion through the night.</i>

147
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,835
Cool.

148
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,118
Listen, if you get all the ingredients together,
I'll pick it up when I come back from class.

149
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,474
OK, then.

150
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,755
Thanks a lot. See you later.

151
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,400
<i>Jagjit, don't hang on me like a girl.</i>

152
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,152
Go get me daal chini.

153
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,268
Bag!

154
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,956
Oh, Jagjit, the hairs on my head will turn white
before you learn to do anything.

155
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,112
<i>Oh, what's the problem, Osama?</i>

156
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,628
Towel head! Towel head!

157
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,273
<i>Cinnamon, friend maker, warm,</i>
<i>brown as Jaggi's skin.</i>

158
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,070
<i>to find you someone who will show you</i>
<i>this America is not so bad.</i>

159
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,796
Jagjit, do you know what your name means?

160
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,918
World conqueror.

161
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,433
<i>Stupid boy.</i>

162
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,838
Thank you.

163
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,393
<i>Hey, buddy, you OK?</i>
<i>Hey, you got a phone, man?</i>

164
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,554
- Hey, man. Are you all right? You OK?
<i>Bring him in.</i>

165
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,312
I can help him.

166
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,914
All right. He's OK. Let's go.

167
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,796
Shall I call an ambulance?

168
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,713
- It's nothing.
<i>I know what he needs.</i>

169
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,438
I'll just be a minute.

170
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,796
<i>I have to help him, chillies. He is hurt.</i>

171
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,279
<i>Why did you send him away, spices?</i>
<i>He was no danger to me.</i>

172
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,510
I don't know what happened, but the bike's fine.
I'd better go. Thanks.

173
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,160
But... you are bleeding.

174
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,355
Please.

175
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,759
Sit down.

176
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,197
Hold your arm out, please.

177
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,158
This is very nice of you.

178
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,879
Where did you learn this?

179
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,554
I uh... grew up with it around me.

180
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,557
It must have been passed down
for generations, huh?

181
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,509
<i>Chilies, you can't be his spice.</i>

182
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,758
Nice place you have here.

183
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,679
What's wrong?

184
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,232
You'd better go now.

185
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,550
Well, thank you. It feels much better.

186
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,435
I'd like to give you something for all your...

187
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,198
Thanks again.

188
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,911
You didn't need to do all this.

189
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,792
<i>I should have listened to you, spices,</i>
<i>and sent him away.</i>

190
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,792
<i>I thought he came to me for help.</i>

191
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,758
<i>America, a new land no older than a heartbeat.</i>

192
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,791
<i>There is so little I know about you.</i>

193
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,796
<i>Ladyjaan, I quit my job with Kapadia memsahib.</i>

194
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,472
<i>You quit?</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

195
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,632
Last night, I was at Fried Kentucky Chicken
on 14th Street...

196
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,790
and someone grabs my shoulder.

197
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,628
Now, I'm praying to Allah as I turn,
but it's only being Mujibar.

198
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,716
Mujibar from my uncle's village!

199
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,031
I didn't even know he was in America.
And he's done good, too.

200
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,076
He's got a couple of taxis already...

201
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,993
...and he's looking for a driver.

202
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,197
Good pay, he's telling me.
Special for a fellow Kashmiri.

203
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,316
And maybe even the chance to buy later on.

204
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,719
Ladyjaan...

205
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,155
there's nothing like being your own master.

206
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:01,118
So, from tomorrow, I'm driving a cab,
black and yellow like a sunflower.

207
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,793
<i>A cab?</i>

208
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,518
<i>This is all your doings.</i>

209
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,832
Thank you.

210
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,037
Come and have a look at my taxi.
It's just outside. Come.

211
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,235
Haroun...

212
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,436
you know I cannot leave this store.

213
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,556
The store will be fine without you for a minute.

214
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,234
It's only a bus backfiring. Ladyjaan, come.

215
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,878
Touch it for good luck, huh?

216
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,751
<i>Ladyjaan?</i>

217
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,676
<i>Are you OK?</i>

218
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,597
How many times have I told you?

219
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:49,754
You should put an ad in India West for a helper.
Running this big store by yourself, it's too much.

220
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,115
Haroun, just be careful.

221
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,439
What?

222
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,114
Look. Please display for me.

223
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,997
My number is on the back,
so you can call me any time.

224
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,275
And I will give you a free ride to San Francisco.

225
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,115
The beautiful Golden Gate Bridge,
Alcatraz Island, the wharf of the fisherman.

226
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,872
I'll take you everywhere.

227
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,556
<i>What does Haroun need?</i>

228
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,349
<i>Kalo jire. Black cumin seeds.</i>

229
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,159
<i>Protector against the evil eye.</i>

230
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,310
<i>Thank you, spices.</i>

231
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,911
<i>Hello?</i>

232
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,638
Hi, Dadaji.

233
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,950
Chi, chi, chi.

234
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,076
I need something for my mental peace.

235
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:12,638
Ever since I came to this America,
I have not got one iota.

236
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:18,959
And that Satish of mine,
"Come, Baba, come here," he said.

237
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,750
"We are all here. Why do you want to be far
away from your flesh, blood

238
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,592
and a younger granddaughter?"

239
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,195
I'd rather not have anything
with this granddaughter at all.

240
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,350
Dadaji, Geeta's such a nice girl.

241
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,912
She's pretty, well-spoken,
and she loves my mango pickle.

242
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,991
It's all right with these foreign girls.

243
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,958
But you tell me one thing yourself.

244
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:46,431
Is it all right to work late, late in the night,
in the office with men?

245
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,830
And that also being dropped by these men
in their cars. You tell me!

246
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,199
Who will want to marry her?

247
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,834
Dadaji... this is America.

248
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,957
And even in India, women are working.

249
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,350
I know it is America. But we are Indians still, no?

250
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,194
You would have not done something like that,
I know it!

251
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,951
When oil and lighting um...

252
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,157
- Match.
...match is put together, there's bound to be fire.

253
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,990
And once the fire starts,
it is very difficult to put it out.

254
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,628
I need something for my mental peace.

255
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,791
I'll get you brahmi oil to cool your system.

256
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,552
And one more thing.

257
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,471
Yesterday she was wearing...

258
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,472
- Where are you going looking like this?
- I'm going out.

259
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,357
With so much of make-up?

260
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,230
In our times, only English women and loose
ladies used to wear so much of make-up.

261
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,394
And good Indian girl is not ashamed
of the face that God has given her.

262
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,471
I'm not ashamed of anything.

263
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,120
And why are you wearing something like this?

264
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,350
You want every man to look at your chest?

265
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,431
Gramps, don't wait up.

266
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,235
But I...

267
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,273
Feeling better?

268
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,713
Thanks to you.

269
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,268
Whatever you put under that bandage
worked wonders.

270
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,192
It's almost all healed.

271
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,840
I didn't get a chance to thank you properly
last time.

272
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:28,233
I was going to have flowers delivered
and I realized I don't even know your name.

273
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,437
I'm Doug.

274
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,919
Tilo.

275
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,474
I will come back for my peace of mind again.

276
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,039
Chi, Dadaji.

277
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,479
Take care, Dadaji.

278
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,397
You take care, my dear.

279
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,958
It smells so beautiful in here.

280
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,039
I must have passed this store hundreds of times
and I've always been scared to come in.

281
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,270
Scared? Why?

282
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,237
I don't know. I wasn't sure if it was OK
for a guy like me to...

283
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,072
Well, you know.

284
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,355
It seems like it's for your community.

285
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,273
No, it's... it's for everyone.

286
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,189
Wow, there must be thousands of spices in here.

287
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,272
How do you keep track of what they're all for?

288
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,759
I can't even cook an egg.

289
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,071
- Everyone has a spice.
- Really?

290
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,390
I got a spice too?

291
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,510
Well, which one's mine?

292
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,194
Um... if you'll wait here a minute,
I'll just go find yours.

293
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,556
<i>Spices, speak to me.</i>

294
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,596
<i>What does he need?</i>

295
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,274
<i>Is it methi seed for strength?</i>

296
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,635
<i>Ajwain for confidence?</i>

297
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,915
<i>Fennel for perseverance?</i>

298
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,195
<i>Why can't I see?</i>

299
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,431
When you begin to weave your desires
into your vision,

300
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,875
<i>the true seeing is taken from you.</i>

301
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,432
<i>You grow confused</i>
<i>and the spices no longer obey.</i>

302
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,269
<i>Asafoetida, the antidote to love.</i>

303
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,191
<i>You can't be his spice.</i>

304
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,796
These chillies look deadly.

305
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,599
They are. You should stay away from them.

306
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,878
What happened to my spice?

307
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,358
It's not something bad, is it?
Some high-carb spice or something?

308
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,352
It's um... It's a special one.

309
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,032
Sorry.

310
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,959
Hey.

311
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,598
Yeah.

312
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,069
<i>I'll be there, like, in like ten minutes.</i>

313
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,479
<i>OK. Bye.</i>

314
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,075
Sorry about that. It's just we've started
a new building down the street.

315
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,832
There's lots of city politics.

316
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,831
You are an architect?

317
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,558
Yeah, but that's just my job.

318
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,756
I got a spice now.

319
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,433
What's my spice supposed to do for me,
anyway?

320
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,233
It depends. What do you need?

321
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,396
You think I need something?

322
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,080
I'm all out of your spice.

323
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,718
But...

324
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,278
I um...

325
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,072
I have something for you.

326
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,198
What is it?

327
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,430
It's... tulsi.

328
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,033
Holy basil.

329
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,871
Mm. What's it for?

330
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,751
Drink it like tea.

331
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,910
And that's on the house.

332
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,070
You know, it's funny.

333
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,311
People look at me
and think that I'm doing OK.

334
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,437
But you look at me like you know something
you're not telling me.

335
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,314
I only know that everyone's welcome here.

336
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,356
There's no need to be scared.

337
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:58,554
I still can't believe that you can remember what
all these spices are for without getting mixed up.

338
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,079
It's simple.

339
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,076
We all have spices.

340
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,515
Just like we all have traditions.

341
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,239
Yeah.

342
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,909
Well... I'll drink this tonight.

343
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,198
I'd better get back to work.

344
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,673
Thanks.

345
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,158
<i>Tulsi... for remembering.</i>

346
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,398
Remember to come back.

347
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,436
Don't Shake Me Up

348
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:47,917
<i>It would be so easy just once</i>
<i>to use the spices for myself.</i>

349
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:55,069
<i>Crushed prishniparni burned with lotus root in</i>
<i>the evening would make him come back to me.</i>

350
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,472
<i>Tulsi... you were right.</i>

351
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,476
<i>Why should he think of me?</i>

352
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,591
<i>He's remembering someone else.</i>

353
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,036
<i>Hello, Beti. You still here?</i>

354
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:54,238
You still here? I've got a letter from
Janu Barwa, my old army friend.

355
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,598
They are looking for a match
for his grandnephew.

356
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,398
You gotta be joking!

357
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,678
I mean, why would I leave my career, my family,
all my friends here

358
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,320
to go some place I've visited, like, twice?

359
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,631
I mean,
I don't even like going to the bathroom in India.

360
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,510
Mom... Dad...

361
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,909
I have met someone...

362
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,956
and we're in love.

363
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,278
No shame at all.

364
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,756
Making talk of love.

365
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:32,150
In front of me, her grandfather.

366
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,071
Anthony Garcia?

367
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,197
Satish, she is marrying a white man?

368
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,157
He's not white. He's chicano.

369
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,959
Chicano? What's that?

370
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,598
I know it's nothing good.

371
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,274
He's Mexican-American.

372
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,751
You are losing your caste and putting
the blackest color on our ancestors' faces

373
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,832
to marry a man whose people
are slum criminals and illegals?

374
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,512
You don't understand, Grandpa.

375
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,989
I understand! I understand everything!

376
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,197
<i>Satish is sitting totally quiet.</i>

377
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,316
I want to tell him.

378
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,709
Once you let cow out of the barn...

379
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,638
...you can't stop it
from trampling the paddy fields.

380
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,275
But when I look at his face...

381
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,271
I don't have the heart.

382
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,195
I say, "Satish...

383
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,635
put me on a plane tomorrow to India.
Tomorrow!"

384
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,391
Dad?

385
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,150
- Dad, say something.
- I trusted you.

386
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,196
I don't want to see your face.

387
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,876
How can you say that to me?

388
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,239
<i>Fine.</i>

389
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,436
Then I'm gonna move in with Tony!

390
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,954
Because he's been asking me.

391
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,828
All this time I've been saying no
because I've been thinking of you.

392
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,433
But now I will.

393
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,954
Then I'll just go ahead and marry him.

394
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,270
Because that's what <i>we</i> want.

395
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,590
I do not know what to do.

396
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,110
So I came to you.

397
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,471
I know you can help.

398
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,193
Please.

399
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,596
<i>Almond powder and kesar to boil in milk.</i>

400
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,272
<i>The whole family must drink it.</i>

401
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:34,672
<i>To sweeten your words</i>
<i>and remember the love buried under the anger.</i>

402
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,193
Thank you.

403
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,872
It's so late.

404
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,548
I'll take a taxi home instead of bus.

405
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,793
<i>Haroun.</i>

406
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,960
<i>Please forgive me, spices.</i>

407
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,553
I've been distracted.

408
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,110
How could I forget the kalo jire
to shield Haroun from the evil eye?

409
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,188
Hey.

410
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,872
Oh, I'm sorry.

411
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,349
- I didn't mean to...
- It's nothing.

412
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,271
Here, let me take a look.

413
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,717
Here. Put some water on it.

414
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,478
Clean it out.

415
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,558
Is that better?

416
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,837
Ladyjaan?

417
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,998
What's going on?

418
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,196
- Haroun...
- You should um...

419
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,316
You should put something on that cut.

420
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,198
Yes, I'll get a neem leaf.

421
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,310
Please help him. It's OK, I'm in no hurry.

422
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,438
You should be careful
who you let in your store after dark.

423
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,076
There's all kinds of mad people roaming
around this neighborhood.

424
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,116
How come your door wasn't locked today?

425
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,510
Just last week a man broke
into the Sri Lankan 7-Eleven

426
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,830
and shot the owner in the chest three times.

427
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,992
Better you ask this fellow to leave
while I'm still being here.

428
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,719
Haroun, I can look after myself very well.

429
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,234
And it's best you do not insult my customers.

430
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,753
I was...

431
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,957
I was speaking out of concern like a brother.

432
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,032
I see I stepped too far.

433
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,672
I didn't mean it like that.

434
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:24,753
What right have I, a poor... taxi driver...
to advise you... a lady?

435
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,353
Haroun, please don't go.

436
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,271
I'll have your package in a few minutes.

437
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,958
Haroun, please!

438
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,795
- I'm sorry about...
- It's OK.

439
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,190
He uh... He seemed kind of pissed off, though.

440
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,429
Is he? Are you and he?

441
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,752
No, no, no, he's just a loyal customer.

442
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,593
He needed some kalo jire for protection.

443
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,596
How can you be so sure what he needs?

444
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,193
I just know.

445
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,318
Like you know what I need?

446
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,750
Why did you give me that tea to drink?

447
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,630
For clarity... at work.

448
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:26,748
Well, ever since you gave it to me,
I've been having the most incredible dreams...

449
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,435
...remembering all this stuff
that I'd completely forgotten about.

450
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:35,798
I don't know how you do it, but you're incredible.

451
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,313
<i>I'm sorry, spices.</i>

452
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,232
Are you OK?

453
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,553
<i>I must give him the asafoetida</i>
<i>and send him away for ever.</i>

454
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:05,030
Um... I'm sorry...

455
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,675
It's... It's very late.

456
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,910
I hope I haven't offended you.

457
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,709
Just I... I just... I just wanted to thank you.

458
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,036
Maybe I can buy you some dinner sometime
and we can go somewhere nice.

459
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,750
- I can't leave the store.
- I mean when you're not busy with the store.

460
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,479
You must get a day off sometime.

461
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,755
I could pick you up on my bike and...

462
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,111
What's your favorite food?

463
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,670
Sushi, Italian.
I know a great little place in Chinatown.

464
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,796
- It has the most...
- I can't leave the store.

465
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,030
Are you married? Have you got a boyfriend?

466
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,792
No! No.

467
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,110
I guess your family wouldn't approve, huh?

468
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,918
Are they real traditional?

469
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,916
I've broken too many rules already.

470
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,916
I think you should leave.

471
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,475
<i>I'm sorry, I never gave you your true spice.</i>

472
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:01,516
<i>Please... do not leave me... spices.</i>

473
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,750
<i>You must speak to me again.</i>

474
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,075
<i>My spices, I knew you wouldn't abandon me.</i>

475
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,878
Garlic never fails.

476
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,235
<i>It is known as the wonder food back home.</i>

477
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,550
You know, I have the perfect thing for you today.

478
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,712
Paan... a must at the end of every couple's meal.

479
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:50,670
What it has here is slivers of supari
for intoxication...

480
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:55,115
...shredded coconut for sweet words...

481
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,351
fennel seeds to digest them...

482
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:04,397
...and... cardamom...
to make the words last forever.

483
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,634
We broke up.

484
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,832
She said it was all going too fast.

485
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,990
I guess I overwhelmed her.

486
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,759
I'm sorry.

487
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,190
I thought I was onto something good.

488
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:26,273
<i>Spices, why punish him when I broke the rules?</i>

489
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:31,319
I came by to ask if I could put this up
in your window.

490
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,597
Yeah, sure.

491
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,750
I'm teaching a new karate class.

492
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,756
<i>Jagjit?</i>

493
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,990
<i>Yes, it's Jagjit.</i>

494
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,638
I remember that look.

495
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,994
Thanks, huh?

496
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,751
Hello, Jagjit.

497
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,478
It's Jag.

498
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,233
- Everything better in school now?
- Who told <i>you</i>?

499
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:07,312
Well, the boys, they don't trouble you any more?

500
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,992
I've got friends now.

501
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:20,909
<i>Oh, cinnamon, friend maker,</i>
<i>what have you done? What friends are these?</i>

502
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,919
<i>Cinnamon, we are losing him.</i>

503
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,910
<i>Spices, speak to me.</i>

504
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,389
<i>Is this the way you've chosen to punish me?</i>

505
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,991
<i>And what about</i> him?

506
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,593
<i>How will you punish him?</i>

507
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,798
<i>Don't spices.</i>

508
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,632
<i>He didn't mean to touch me.</i>

509
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,516
<i>I won't see him again, spices.</i>

510
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,750
<i>Please, don't hurt him.</i>

511
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,319
Hi.

512
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,555
<i>Such perfect timing, my clever spices.</i>

513
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:27,553
I wanna make a special meal for someone,
but I've never cooked Indian before.

514
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,074
<i>She looks like she's never chopped an onion</i>
<i>in her life.</i>

515
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,037
I was hoping you could help me with that.

516
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,755
Yes, of course.

517
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,796
My problem is, I don't know what I want.

518
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,791
Who are you cooking for?

519
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,871
Well, it's for this guy I've been dating.

520
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,235
But he's been kinda distant lately.

521
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:50,913
I wanna make something easy.

522
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,117
But I don't want the smell to get into my hair
and stay in the house.

523
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:56,236
You know what I mean?

524
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,312
Um... I'll find the perfect thing for you.

525
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,038
Great.

526
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,996
<i>I could give her mischievous mustard seed</i>
<i>to send him away from her forever.</i>

527
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,433
<i>I really appreciate this.</i>

528
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,436
<i>He's gonna love it.</i>

529
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:24,671
Maybe you can make him
a sumptuous biryani with green cardamom.

530
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,751
<i>You are speaking to me again.</i>

531
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,273
OK.

532
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,397
<i>Cardamom, to bind true loves.</i>

533
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,789
<i>Then it must be her that he needs.</i>

534
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,235
<i>Who am I to take away their happiness?</i>

535
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,194
- Here's your change.
- Thanks so much.

536
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,515
I'll have him eating out of my hand after this.

537
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,756
I'll let you know how it turned out.

538
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,796
You must. Good luck.

539
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,116
<i>I must let him go.</i>

540
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,509
<i>Or the spices will destroy us both.</i>

541
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,717
<i>I've neglected what is important.</i>

542
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:28,673
<i>Anant Soni, who comes every month for rendi,</i>
<i>oil from the castorplant.</i>

543
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,832
<i>to massage into his mother's arthritic hands.</i>

544
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,356
<i>And Prameela Viji</i>
<i>who sells million-dollar houses.</i>

545
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,670
<i>and sends the money to her sister in a shelter.</i>

546
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,393
<i>I'll give her a special blend</i>
<i>of my garam masala today, for hope.</i>

547
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:51,554
<i>Thank you, spices,</i>
<i>for reminding me of my duty to others.</i>

548
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,119
Tilo...

549
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:19,512
Tilo, I need to speak to you.

550
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,074
- Doug, I cannot...
- Just for, like, two minutes.

551
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,319
Please.

552
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,875
I'll get you a nimbu pani. A lime soda.

553
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,632
It'll cool you down.

554
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,198
So uh... what's wrong?

555
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,432
It's my mom.

556
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,312
She died.

557
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,352
I'm so sorry.

558
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,273
Was she with you?

559
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,028
No.

560
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:49,919
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have... bust in here like this.

561
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,595
I just... I think I'm in shock, you know.

562
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,798
I should go.

563
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,717
- No, wait.
<i>- No, you were right.</i>

564
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:03,031
<i>- I shouldn't have come.</i>
- Have this drink.

565
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:08,239
Please.

566
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,799
<i>Black gold.</i>

567
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:25,077
<i>Brought by traders round the world.</i>

568
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,912
<i>King of spices.</i>

569
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,992
Is that pepper? That was strong.

570
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,435
<i>To help you tell your deepest secrets.</i>

571
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,151
You can tell me whatever you want.

572
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,838
I won't judge you.

573
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:44,154
I never really talked about this with anybody.

574
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,269
I don't even know where to start.

575
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,351
I feel so numb.

576
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,351
It's my mom.

577
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,231
Her ashes just showed up at my doorstep.

578
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:00,032
I don't even know how they found me.

579
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,950
I never wanted to see her again till I met you.

580
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,389
<i>The truth is,</i>
<i>my mom died for me a long time ago.</i>

581
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:16,031
<i>My dad was an orphan</i>
<i>who met my mom at a roadside diner.</i>

582
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:22,558
<i>His hands were always so black</i>
<i>from working at the refinery.</i>

583
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,312
But my mom's hands...

584
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,873
<i>... were always perfect.</i>

585
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,432
Vroom! Vrooom!

586
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,192
She looked like a movie star.

587
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:37,158
You know, she had these high pointy heels.

588
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,758
<i>Even her name - Celestina -</i>

589
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,870
<i>had more flair than the neighbors".</i>

590
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,712
<i>She used to complain about my hair.</i>

591
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,588
She said it was too coarse, unruly.

592
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:06,429
One day this man showed up at our house
when my dad was at work.

593
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,678
Evie. Evie!

594
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,718
Why have you come here? To ruin my life?

595
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,189
<i>You ought to be ashamed,</i>
<i>acting like a white woman.</i>

596
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,396
Your little boy don't even know who he is.

597
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,199
Dougie, honey, go back upstairs.

598
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,799
Get out of here.

599
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,599
He's dying.
I promised him I'd find you and tell you.

600
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,352
I don't know owe him nothing.

601
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,840
The next day, when my dad was gone,

602
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,558
my mom took us on a ride.

603
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,189
Evie.

604
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,953
<i>Evie, my little flower.</i>

605
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,754
You came... with your son.

606
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,319
Please.

607
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,470
<i>Leave the boy with me.</i>

608
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:27,479
I only have a little time,
my darling granddaughter.

609
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:30,313
<i>Please... let me talk to him.</i>

610
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:36,999
I ask it as payment for all that you threw away.

611
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:42,837
I want the boy to have a choice for his life's path.

612
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,150
<i>As you had.</i>

613
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,593
Please...

614
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,557
<i>let me talk to him.</i>

615
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,759
<i>Please.</i>

616
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:56,032
You can talk to him, Tata.

617
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,758
But I stay in the room.

618
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,799
For you, my son.

619
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,196
No!

620
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,119
Tata.

621
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,194
Come on.

622
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,111
We've gotta get out of here.

623
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,758
- Come on!
- No!

624
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,832
- You killed him!
- I should never have come back here!

625
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,754
Phew!
This pepper drink has a kick to it, I tell you.

626
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,309
I don't even know
why I dumped all that stuff on you.

627
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,879
I'm sorry.

628
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,234
Come.

629
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,072
Let's get some fresh air.

630
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,108
It's embarrassing to bring all this stuff up.

631
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,352
Did you ever go back?

632
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:39,276
After my dad died, I left home
and stopped talking to my mom.

633
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,716
God, I hated her.

634
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,313
She gave it all up cos she wanted to fit in.

635
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,998
And you just abandoned her?

636
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:54,036
I'm not proud of that.

637
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,470
I did try to find her a few years ago.

638
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,669
But she moved away.

639
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,158
You know, the old man...

640
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,879
Your great-grandfather.

641
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:15,515
Although he spoke to me in some language
I never heard before, I still understood him.

642
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,714
You know what? I felt part of something.

643
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,597
I kept that feather all these years,

644
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:25,592
hoping one day I'd find
what he was trying to give me.

645
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,713
<i>Now it's too late.</i>

646
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:29,994
Is it?

647
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,316
I'm betting you know exactly what to do.

648
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:39,509
No, I don't always have all the answers, Doug.

649
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:48,389
From my window in San Francisco,
sometimes I look across the bay and...

650
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,230
...I imagine you here.

651
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,711
I've never really been to San Francisco.

652
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,552
You're kidding me.

653
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:05,595
Well, come with me, then.
I'll show you everything, all my spots.

654
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,159
I cannot.

655
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,550
There's more to you than this store, Tilo.
I know that.

656
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:18,400
And I know that... a handsome man like you
can never be alone.

657
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,877
You'd be surprised.

658
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:36,071
I didn't have a clue what I wanted till I met you.

659
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,513
Not a clue.

660
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,077
Did you ever feel like you just want to...

661
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,037
...you just want to start all over again?

662
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,471
I guess it's easy for me to say
because I don't have what you have.

663
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:00,556
I'm not rooted like you are.

664
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:08,599
When the roots are too strong,
they can strangle you too.

665
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:17,196
I'll see you tomorrow, then?

666
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,032
It's a date?

667
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,076
Come on.

668
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,553
You deserve a day off.

669
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:05,913
<i>Haroun.</i>

670
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,109
<i>I'll stay up all night</i>
<i>and split the seeds for Haroun.</i>

671
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,752
<i>I must protect him.</i>

672
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,478
<i>Hello?</i>

673
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,831
Are you trying to kill us?

674
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,717
My husband nearly choked.

675
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,030
It's much too hot. It burnt his insides.

676
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,753
I'm so sorry. I don't know what happened.

677
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:52,796
I put the same amount of chillies in it.

678
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,110
You've been careless, that's what's happened.

679
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,156
Now, who's going to pay doctor's bills, huh?

680
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:03,590
I'm really sorry. Please, take back your money.

681
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:07,798
How's Jagjit?
My son is none of your business.

682
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,677
You've done enough damage.

683
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:15,278
I am having no luck.
Satish refuses to mention Geeta.

684
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,112
The almond and kesar powder?

685
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,156
We did everything that you asked us to do.

686
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,914
<i>Can't you see, spices?</i>
<i>All Geeta wants is to be happy.</i>

687
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,116
<i>Don't turn on me, spices.</i>

688
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:59,078
<i>You know my customers need me.</i>

689
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,957
<i>Don't punish them.</i>

690
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:08,269
<i>Dadaji, you said you would do anything</i>
<i>to bring Geeta back into the family.</i>

691
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:12,478
<i>Mix this in your rice and for one hour</i>
<i>you will have the golden tongue.</i>

692
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,835
<i>Whatever you ask, people must obey.</i>

693
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,876
OK.

694
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:24,110
<i>Spices, I have to get the kalo jire to Haroun.</i>

695
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:28,476
<i>This is for him...</i>

696
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,516
<i>not for me.</i>

697
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,910
<i>I'm not leaving you, spices.</i>

698
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,877
<i>I will be back.</i>

699
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:48,238
Sure you wanna do this?

700
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:54,400
I'm going because I have to help someone.

701
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:57,193
This is where I have to go.

702
01:04:58,520 --> 01:04:59,873
OK.

703
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,512
Don't worry.

704
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,556
Here's your helmet.

705
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,318
Haroun!

706
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,392
He just left five minutes ago.

707
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:56,473
But he comes back at sundown for prayers
and food and then he goes back out again.

708
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,030
We must be back before sundown.

709
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,838
I'll bring you back. Don't worry.

710
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:16,831
Just shift gears.

711
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:20,196
Today... I get to take care of you.

712
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:23,033
Aap Ki Nazron Ne Samjha "Flute Mix"

713
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,672
Thank you.

714
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:55,148
Sure you don't want me to stay for you?
I can wait here.

715
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:58,312
No, it's OK. My friend will take me home.

716
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,958
OK.

717
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:01,553
Thank you.

718
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:02,959
Hey!

719
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,799
Thanks.

720
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,438
I had a great day.

721
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:30,353
Haroun?

722
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:35,157
He hasn't returned yet.

723
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,151
Why don't you come in and have some hot chai?

724
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,912
He'll soon be home for prayers.

725
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,956
No, thank you.

726
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,473
Chai?

727
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:55,032
Thank you.

728
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:57,759
- I'm Hameeda.
- I'm Tilo.

729
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:00,239
Do you live alone?

730
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:02,629
No, no, my brother brought me here to study.

731
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:04,312
He and his wife look after me.

732
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,672
Do you know Haroun well?

733
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,354
Oh, no, he's always so busy.

734
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,670
And he's so shy with women
he hardly speaks to me.

735
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:17,469
If we meet on the stairs, he just says
"Salaam alaikum," and hurries down.

736
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,869
He won't even look me in the eyes.

737
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,435
That's his car. He's home.

738
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:31,148
He goes to the market and always gets so much
fresh fruit, he comes up with so many bags.

739
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:32,832
Haroun?

740
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,277
Haroun!

741
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,316
Help me!

742
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:15,355
No time for tears, Ladyjaan.
Hold his head like this and Bhaijaan go get help.

743
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,670
- Ambulance?
- No, no, who knows who they'll tell?

744
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,432
We'll get Rahman sahib instead.

745
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:28,435
Haroun.

746
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:31,756
<i>I'm so sorry I failed you.</i>

747
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,070
<i>Distracted by my own desires.</i>

748
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,034
So many wounds like this I've had to stitch.

749
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:54,273
Nobody puts this in letters
when sending money home.

750
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:56,112
Tilo, daughter, you have gone too far.

751
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:59,272
This will destroy you and everything you are.

752
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:00,634
First Mother.

753
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:04,029
You must return now to where you belong.

754
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:05,872
You are in danger.

755
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:09,029
You have broken too many rules.

756
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,355
But we have to live by different rules here.

757
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:17,590
Maybe the spices are not enough
by themselves.

758
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:19,910
You are nothing without the spices.

759
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,753
The spices are your tradition.

760
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:24,910
Do not let America seduce you.

761
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:29,190
With your dreams of love,
you have roused the spices' hate.

762
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,157
You know about him?

763
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:35,836
To all whom a mistress loves,
as she should not...

764
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,399
chaos will come.

765
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,636
<i>I want the spices.</i>

766
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:42,517
<i>And him.</i>

767
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:47,879
If a mistress fails in her duty, fire is the end.

768
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:50,872
<i>The spices will decide.</i>

769
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:16,272
I'm not waiting as long for you
to take another day off, you know.

770
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:30,392
It's not going to work.

771
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,152
What do you mean?

772
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:36,952
There are rules.

773
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:39,715
So?

774
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:43,592
Your mother broke the rules
and look how that hurt you.

775
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,437
That was her choice.

776
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:48,556
But you helped me make sense of it.

777
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:51,710
You said I can be whoever the hell I want to be.

778
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,836
So can you.

779
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:00,191
Don't kill this.

780
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:05,189
Don't kill this before it's even started.

781
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,837
I'm coming back for you tonight.

782
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,792
<i>Spices, I know it cannot be.</i>

783
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,631
<i>I have chosen to go back.</i>

784
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,108
Hello, Beti.

785
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:46,912
It's still hurting.

786
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,275
But I had to come and thank you.

787
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:55,552
Geeta's coming home with her boyfriend,
that Tony fellow.

788
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:57,517
<i>Thank you, spices.</i>

789
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:00,637
<i>You have helped open eyes,</i>
<i>so Geeta can marry her love.</i>

790
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:02,312
I'm not going to say anything.

791
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:05,152
Hello!

792
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:09,829
I saw the poster in your window
and went along to his class.

793
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:13,913
<i>And saffron,</i>
<i>Myisha and Kwesi have found love, too.</i>

794
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,797
He can cook, too.

795
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:17,552
She taught me everything I know.

796
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:20,074
<i>What do we get?</i>
<i>Anything with garlic.</i>

797
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:22,151
Everything OK, Jagjit?

798
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:24,595
Yeah, it's all good.

799
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:27,478
Don't be scared. It's just a bus backfiring.

800
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,596
Scared? I ain't scared.

801
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:37,717
Are you all right, son? Somebody after you?

802
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:43,076
How would you like never to be scared again,
Jagjit?

803
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,868
Teach him, till he's a master like you.

804
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:57,712
Why are you doing this?

805
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,030
Because I want to.

806
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:03,908
<i>Cinnamon,</i>
<i>you have found a true friend for Jagjit</i>

807
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,958
<i>to guide him through the highs and lows</i>
<i>of life in America.</i>

808
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:11,271
<i>Thank you, spices.</i>
<i>Their desires are now fulfilled.</i>

809
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,793
Whatever, man...

810
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,552
I never got to cook for him.

811
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:23,756
Turns out he's fallen in love with someone else.

812
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,679
He told you that?

813
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:28,398
Yeah.

814
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:32,950
I can't hate him for it.
I've never seen him so happy.

815
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:39,075
<i>Please, spices, give me one night with Doug.</i>

816
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:42,555
<i>One night for</i> my <i>desires.</i>

817
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:46,950
<i>Then you have me forever.</i>

818
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:49,076
Aap Ki Nazron Ne Samjha

819
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,756
Ladyjaan.

820
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:16,076
You look... different.

821
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:18,758
Or is it my eye playing?

822
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,710
I have brought something for you.

823
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,472
Are you feeling better?

824
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:28,553
Oh, yes.
Hameeda and her brother have been very kind.

825
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:32,838
She's been cooking all day for us
and she's been keeping me company.

826
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:34,831
Today will you have some chai?

827
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,632
And you?

828
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:41,075
Sure. I'll help her.

829
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:50,156
Haroun... I've come to say goodbye.

830
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,319
Where are you going?

831
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,437
I'm returning back home.

832
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:01,550
What about your store, Ladyjaan,
and your customers?

833
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:04,393
Is it not right for us to go back
to where we belong?

834
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:08,475
Not for me, Ladyjaan.

835
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,551
Are you not angry at what they did to you?

836
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:13,151
Of course, I'm angry, Ladyjaan.

837
01:19:13,240 --> 01:19:17,233
But I still have both my eyes
and I have such friends.

838
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:21,677
<i>Haroun, you have found so much more</i>
<i>than wealth here.</i>

839
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:25,469
<i>You came for a dream and found love.</i>

840
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:30,269
Now, what did you bring for me?

841
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:32,718
It's for Hameeda.

842
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:38,356
Well, actually... it's for you both... together.

843
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,152
<i>Lotus root.</i>

844
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:43,595
You put this on her on the night of your wedding.

845
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:46,353
It's for a lifetime of deep loving.

846
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,078
Here it is.

847
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:17,679
What do you think?

848
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,591
It's uh... It's beautiful.

849
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:21,352
Is this yours?

850
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:24,512
Oh, yeah. It's an old bakery, actually.

851
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:28,392
I just love the idea of making old things new.

852
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:32,112
There's something cool about it.

853
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:44,954
<i>Forgive me, Doug,</i>
<i>but I have to return to where I belong.</i>

854
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:48,555
<i>You showed me such love.</i>

855
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:49,993
<i>Thank you.</i>

856
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,036
<i>But it cannot be.</i>

857
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:55,594
<i>I do not expect you to understand.</i>

858
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:57,989
<i>But there is no other way.</i>

859
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,957
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

860
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:03,271
<i>I will carry your love with me forever.</i>

861
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:44,512
<i>Spices.</i>

862
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,556
<i>I never left you.</i>

863
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:48,437
<i>I could have lived with you.</i>

864
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:50,879
<i>And him.</i>

865
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:54,554
<i>Love cannot be wrong.</i>

866
01:22:55,960 --> 01:23:00,033
<i>But I will leave him, if it means losing you.</i>

867
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:02,792
<i>I give my life to you.</i>

868
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,599
Tilo!

869
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,113
Tilo!

870
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:34,236
Are you OK?

871
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:36,311
Are you OK?

872
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:42,672
I woke up and you were gone.

873
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:45,918
I read your note.

874
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,231
I crossed the bridge and just
as I got to the other side...

875
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,356
...the quake hit.

876
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:54,112
Are you sure you're OK?

877
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:56,918
Yes.

878
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:04,315
Let's get you out... Let's get you out of here.

879
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:29,077
Tilo Mistress,
you have shown your devotion to the spices.

880
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:33,829
The spices know you will never leave them.

881
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:38,998
Doug, I'm not leaving.

882
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:41,837
You're staying with me.

883
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:43,831
I mean here.

884
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:46,273
I'm not leaving here.

885
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:48,999
Tilo, there's nothing left here.

886
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:52,357
This is my home.

887
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:01,275
I guess I can help you rebuild it.

888
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:09,634
You never told me what my spice is.

889
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:13,078
Sesame.

890
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:15,792
Tilo.
