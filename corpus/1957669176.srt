1
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:23,456
-  No, no!

2
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:18,478
- Oh, my god. Little girl?

3
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:19,813
Little girl, are you okay?

4
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:22,782
Are you okay?

5
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:47,906
No. No!

6
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:50,309
No!

7
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:52,345
No!

8
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,746
No! No!

9
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:35,688
-  All right, we
made the left at the fork,

10
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:38,625
so Lily Road should be
coming up any second.

11
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:44,963
- I can't find it.

12
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,402
- It's because it's not
gonna be on that phone.

13
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:51,871
You gotta look up.
Gotta eyeball it.

14
00:02:53,082 --> 00:02:54,683
-  How'd I
agree to this again?

15
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:57,610
- 'Cause the Young
Writers Club needed you.

16
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,844
Seriously, if you hadn't
signed up for this field trip,

17
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:02,248
we wouldn't be here.

18
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:03,282
Thank you.

19
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,561
- Well, my soul
would've preferred

20
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:06,819
a trip to Steinbeck's home.

21
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,022
- Uh-huh. Too far.

22
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,693
You look like a superhero
with those glasses on.

23
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:16,729
Like a female Clark Kent.

24
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,732
- Wow, thanks.

25
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:22,835
- I meant that as a compliment.

26
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,671
- It didn't sound that way.

27
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:25,738
- Okay, how about this?

28
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,376
You look smart and
drop dead gorgeous.

29
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:32,477
How's that?

30
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,448
- That's inappropriate.

31
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,952
- Wow. Can't win
with you, can I?

32
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,353
- We work together.

33
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:42,831
As in, I have to
see you every day

34
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,924
in the teacher's lounge
until I get my tenure.

35
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,626
-  I know. I heard.

36
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,573
- Ooh! Lily Road.

37
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,645
- How we doing back there, guys?

38
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:06,713
- Nauseous.

39
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:11,751
-  Okay. Try
looking out the window.

40
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,419
Watch the road.

41
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,989
- Are
you gonna blow chunks?

42
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:21,494
Hey, yo, yo, yo,
Teach. Stop the van.

43
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,096
We got a spewer in the backseat.

44
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:28,334
Oh!

45
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:32,705
Oh.

46
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,341
Thar she blows.

47
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:43,750
- Go outside and see
if she painted the van.

48
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,852
- I will, I will.

49
00:04:45,885 --> 00:04:49,756
Side of the boat is all clean,
Captain. Nice aim, Teala.

50
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,358
-  Sorry.

51
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:53,559
- You okay, Teala?

52
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,094
-  Yeah,
just need a minute.

53
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:56,928
- Okay.

54
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,602
- Best book ever.

55
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:06,806
You have such a way with words.

56
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:11,811
It's like I'm inside them,
feeling every pain, every joy.

57
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:13,746
- You liked it.

58
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,616
- Mm-hm. I loved it.

59
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,051
I can't wait to read the others.

60
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,720
- Well, it's my only one, so...

61
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:23,122
I appreciate it,
Josie. Thank you.

62
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,826
- Well, you really are an
incredible writer, Chris.

63
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:28,861
- Mr. Cotton.

64
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:30,930
- They can call me Chris.

65
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,703
Mr. C. How about Mr. C?

66
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,406
- Eh.

67
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,974
- All right, I'm good. - Yes?

68
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,410
- All right.
- All right, let's do it.

69
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:45,812
Okay.

70
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,513
- Yup! - All right.

71
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:48,748
- Give me that. - What's that?

72
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:49,582
-  Don't touch it.

73
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,551
-  Okay.

74
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:54,120
-  Yeah, yeah, like,

75
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,456
we don't need to see it again...

76
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:41,033
- So this is Teardrop. Wow.

77
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,505
- Oh, it was booming
back in its day.

78
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,707
Teardrop was a gold rush town.

79
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,884
Think the mines
are supposed to be

80
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,443
in those hills right there.

81
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,479
But when there's
something of great value,

82
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:54,647
trouble always follows.

83
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,752
So the miners would chain dogs
up to the mouth of the mine

84
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:00,920
to keep the thieves out.

85
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:04,657
But when the gold was
gone, the miners were gone.

86
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,795
Those sick bastards would
leave the dogs tied up to die.

87
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,901
Hell dogs are supposed
to haunt this town now.

88
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,938
They said, at night, you can
hear them howling in pain.

89
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,208
No one's actually ever
seen them, though.

90
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:28,214
And that is the story
of the great Teardrop.

91
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:29,949
Come on.

92
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,684
Come on. We're
checking in right here.

93
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,965
Afternoon. We are
looking to check in.

94
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,569
Do you have any rooms available?

95
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,602
- We might.

96
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,109
- I would've called in advance,

97
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,680
but I couldn't find
your number anywhere.

98
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:03,182
- We like to operate
by word of mouth.

99
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,818
Keeps his place from
becoming a tourist trap.

100
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:18,931
Pardon my stare. I could've
sworn you've checked in before.

101
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,633
- No. No.

102
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,666
No. Never.

103
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:24,070
- Must be deja vu, then.

104
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:27,874
- Denver, is it?

105
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,879
- Like the capital of Colorado.

106
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,016
- Are you the
owner of the hotel?

107
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,018
- I wear all the
hats so to speak.

108
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,588
That your family?

109
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,757
- No. My students.

110
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,028
They're on their senior field
trip. Young Authors Club.

111
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:49,862
-  Hm.

112
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:50,863
- It's their last year,

113
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,065
so I wanted to take them
somewhere unforgettable.

114
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:56,335
- Our town's so forgettable,
most don't know we exist.

115
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,872
- That's exactly why we're here.

116
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:04,377
So I'll need five
rooms, if that's okay.

117
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,612
- One is what I've got.

118
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,216
- Are you kidding?

119
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,151
- Well, we are almost
at full capacity.

120
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:14,886
That an issue?

121
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,094
- It just seems quiet.

122
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,933
- Well, we have some old timers
who like to tuck in early.

123
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:33,039
I don't keep tabs on my
guests, but I do keep a tab.

124
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,045
Care for a drink?

125
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:42,347
- No.

126
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,119
-  You sure?

127
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,721
- Yes. It's early.

128
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,889
Thank you. I'm sure.

129
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:59,332
- I do have the old
judge's cabin available.

130
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:01,334
Gonna cost you extra, though.

131
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,902
- Judge?

132
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,670
- Called him the Hanging Judge.

133
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,342
- The Hanging Judge?

134
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,375
- That's right.

135
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:19,018
- They have one room
and a cabin available.

136
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:19,952
- Oh, well, that's perfect.
- What?

137
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,054
- So it'll be the three
of us in the cabin.

138
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:23,689
And then you guys
can take the room.

139
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:24,833
- Yeah, that's a great
idea. Let's do that.

140
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:27,994
- No. The obvious choice is
me and Chris in the hotel.

141
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,762
- Chris and I.

142
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:35,267
AP English exam next week. And
I thought we agreed on Mr. C?

143
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:39,739
- Um, I didn't agree
to anything, Ms. H.

144
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:41,273
- A cabin and a room is fine.

145
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,109
I'll take the girls.
You take Ross.

146
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,846
Nice to meet you. I'm Rebecca.

147
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,085
- I've been cleaning up
things in the back, ma'am.

148
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:56,255
Don't wanna make your
hands all filthy now.

149
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:00,726
Room 2 in the hotel,
end of the road.

150
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:08,134
Cabin about 50 yards from there,

151
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,203
past the church.

152
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:16,142
- Thank you, Denver.

153
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,777
- You are the very welcome.

154
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:22,914
Excuse me, mister.

155
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,020
- Sorry. The bill.

156
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:31,123
So I'm assuming that this
is a cash-only kinda place.

157
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,927
- Teardrop's really
more of a pit stop.

158
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,465
Come through, take a
glance out the window,

159
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,034
and keep on moving.

160
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,104
I recommend you do the same.

161
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,109
- It's not my first rodeo.

162
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,080
- You sure we
haven't met before?

163
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,181
- Oh, I'm sure.

164
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,148
-  Hm?

165
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,462
- I'd remember someone like you.

166
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:00,819
How much?

167
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:03,456
- How much do you got?

168
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:07,826
- Right.

169
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:21,207
You can just say when.

170
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,178
- That'll do.

171
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,212
- Okay.

172
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,216
-  Enjoy your stay now.

173
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,235
-  All right.
All right, all right.

174
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,229
The cabin and the hotel
are down this way.

175
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,231
So let's go grab our bags.

176
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:00,379
-  No way.

177
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:02,281
-  This is me and Ross.

178
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:03,949
- Oh, this is us?

179
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,619
Oh, swim move.

180
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:09,522
Ooh. Hey, I got dips on
this bad boy right here.

181
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:15,294
- Chris, come get in my selfie.

182
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,417
-  We
don't allow photos.

183
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,102
- Sorry. Kids and
their smartphones.

184
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,004
You know how they are.

185
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:26,038
- Don't do it again.

186
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:32,611
-  We won't. Sorry.

187
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,180
- Is he serious?

188
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:39,552
- Real nice guy.

189
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:40,585
-  Mm-hm.

190
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:43,656
-  Let's go.

191
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,291
- No. I'm good here.

192
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,059
Unless Josie wants to...

193
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:48,994
- Okay. - No, I'm good.

194
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,163
Wouldn't want you touching
my luggage anyways.

195
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,935
- Made a friend, huh? - Mm-hm.

pair of double Ds before?

215
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,374

00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:57,689

Yeah.

222
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:09,301

223
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:12,471
Bet this hotel hasn't changed
in over a hundred years.

224
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,306
Wonder what brought
the town down.

225
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,410
Bet it was smallpox.

- Yeah, I was. - Huh.

- I said this town,
it's crazy, isn't it?

231
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,231
It's like a portal back in time.

232
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:41,600
- That's crazy.

00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:46,271

Yeah, come on, come

247
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:14,442
- Didn't mean to bother you.

- Oh, no, no, no. You didn't.

249
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:20,606
I just, or, well,
my teacher and I,

250
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,808
we're writing a
book about the town.

251
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:24,510
We just wanna ask
you a few questions.

252
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,412
We're interested, you know?

253
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:31,717
- I'd love to hear about the
town of Teardrop from a local.

254
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,687
- I'm not supposed
to talk to customers.

255
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:39,158
- Okay. Well, what are
you supposed to do, then?

256
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,294
- Clean, quiet as a mouse.

257
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,564
- Well, yeah. She's
a maid, Mr. C.

258
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:46,398
That's what she...

259
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,734
She cleans, you know.

260
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,569
I'm Ross the Boss.

261
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:52,371
Or, well, you can
just call me Ross.

262
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,540
I mean, Ross the Boss
is like my nickname,

263
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,642
my alias, you know, my rap name.

264
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:57,776
It's nice to meet you.

265
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,580
- I'm sorry. I'm not allowed.

266
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:06,418
- You're not allowed to shake...

267
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,620
Damn.

268
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,865
What did I do wrong
there?

269
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,524
Don't laugh, Mr. C.

270
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,860
Don't act like you have...

271
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,701
- Yes, yes!

272
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:23,702
- That sounded like hurt.

273
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:25,537
- No, no, no. That doesn't hurt.

274
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,573
That's great positioning.

275
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,308
That's what that is. - Ew.

276
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:30,275
- This is pretty ridiculous.
- You know what position

277
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,610
that is, Josie? - Ew, shut up.

278
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,579
- That's cowgirl.
- That's inappropriate.

279
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:34,789
- That's just the place
we're in right now.

280
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,181
-  Shh.

281
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,703
-  Well, there
are definitely guests here.

282
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:00,806
- I haven't seen anyone.

283
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,675
- I can hear them,
like, you know.

284
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:06,912
- No...

285
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:08,914
I don't know what that is.
- From your room.

286
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:10,558
The kids are having a
listening party at the moment.

287
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:11,717
-  You heard them?

288
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,385
- Yeah.

289
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,588
- Something to drink, ma'am?

290
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:17,623
- No thank you.

291
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,790
-  Hm.

292
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,930
- Like you should be. Us
being the adults and all.

293
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:27,609
- I had a little
bit of a headache.

294
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:30,502
I just think one will
help take the edge off.

295
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,004
- A headache, huh?

296
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,639
- Yeah. Headache.

297
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:37,342
Denver here was about to tell us

298
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,547
about why the town
was named Teardrop.

299
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,586
- You ask a lot of questions.

300
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,289
- It's 'cause he's a novelist.

301
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,024
- Is he now? - Mm-hm.

302
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:55,894
Published bestseller. And he
still graces us as a teacher.

303
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,329
-  Hm.

304
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,032
- What can I say?
I love to teach.

305
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,600
- What are your books about?

306
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:07,272
- American frontier ghost towns.
And it's "book," singular.

307
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:10,709
- He's being modest. He's
writing a new one right now.

308
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:11,742
- Well...

309
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:13,779
To answer your question,

310
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,982
the town was named
after a little girl.

311
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:23,855
A quiet child who loved
her dolls made of straw.

312
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:27,858
Lorelei.

313
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:34,600
Lorelei was a strange one,
kept to herself and her toys,

314
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:39,638
but she became a
pariah around town.

315
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,740
Kids pinched her,

316
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,612
called her a freak,

317
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:50,449
anything to get a
rise out of her.

318
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,786
But little Lorelei
wouldn't react.

319
00:20:56,722 --> 00:21:00,392
Kids being kids,
they took it too far.

320
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:04,396
They started pelting
her with stones

321
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,599
until she was
bruised and bloodied.

322
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:11,903
And still, the
girl would not cry.

323
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:17,676
Legend has it, Lorelei
never shed a single tear

324
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,544
no matter what anyone did.

325
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:26,752
Nowadays, we'd know
she had a disorder,

326
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:31,356
a genetic inability to cry.

327
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:42,634
- Well, that's some
way to name a town.

328
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,007
- You asked.

329
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,383
- You know, I think
I will have a drink.

330
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:00,886
-  Yes, ma'am.

331
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,756
- What? We're allowed
to have some fun, right?

332
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,796
-  Look what I brought.

333
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:11,496
- Are those brownies?

334
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,032
- Mm-hm, edibles. - Nice.

335
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:15,106
- Who's down to get baked?

336
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,435
Josie? You're down.

337
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:18,437
Teala? Down to get baked?

338
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,739
- Oh, sorry. Can't.

339
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:21,840
Studying.

340
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:26,044
- Teala, have you ever
even gotten stoned?

341
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,880
- Um, no.

342
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,549
- No?

343
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:33,985
Oh, we are so popping
your weed cherry tonight.

344
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,722
- No. No one is
popping my weed cherry.

345
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,190
Or any cherry for that matter.

346
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:40,192
- Oh, come on. We'll
guide you through it.

347
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,993
We'll be like your
green Sherpas.

348
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,662
- Yeah, and these are edibles,

349
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:44,996
so they don't hurt your lungs.

350
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,698
I mean, it's weed.

351
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:48,576
So you'll lose a couple
of brain cells, big deal.

352
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,736
You have enough for all
three of us combined.

353
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,704
- True.
- Ah, I don't know about that.

354
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,206
-  All right, here. Teala.

355
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:55,207
Ooh! - Oh.

356
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,141
- You caught it.

357
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:57,709
Josie. Ooh.

358
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:58,810
That's the best one.

359
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:01,146
-  Mm.

360
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:02,647
- Am I gonna freak
out over this?

361
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,559
- No, you'll get high.
- Am I gonna hallucinate

362
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:05,717
and shit? - Come on.

363
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:06,952
It'll be fun. I promise.

364
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:10,956
- Is that Nutella?

365
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:14,126
- Yeah, and cannabutter.
Whole jar of it right here.

366
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,727
All right, ready?
Let's all take it.

367
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:17,095
Three, two-

368
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:19,164
- One bite, okay?
One bite, that's it.

369
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:20,832
- Okay, and then
after that first bite,

370
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,934
you'll eat the whole
thing so you can get high.

371
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:23,968
One.

372
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:27,638
-  Okay.

373
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:30,809
-  Mm.

374
00:23:30,842 --> 00:23:31,910
- Mm. - Nice job.

375
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:33,178
These are amazing. - Mm-hm.

376
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:37,716
Thank you. That's not the
only thing I do well, Josie.

377
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:49,528
- That portrait in the hotel
entrance, that's her, right?

378
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:50,162
Lorelei?

379
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,463
-  Mm-hm.

380
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,599
- What's her mother's name?

381
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:56,767
- Alice.

382
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,871
- Alice.

383
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:02,841
- I think we've had enough
story time for one night.

384
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,619
- Maybe I'm a little tipsy,

385
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:16,521
but I think he's
kinda growing on me.

386
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:20,926
What?

387
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:21,793
-  You're a little tipsy.

388
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:24,696
Don't you like him?

389
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:26,198
I like him.

390
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:31,870
-  Josie,
what are you doing?

391
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:32,704
-  Taking a selfie, duh.

392
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:34,673
- Yeah, she's taking
a selfie, duh.

393
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:35,983
Let me get in there.
- Guys, we're not supposed

394
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:37,843
to take pictures.
- Teala, get in here.

395
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:39,044
- Gonna get in trouble.

396
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:41,746
- Come on.

397
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:52,290
Oh, what the hell?

398
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,324
- What?

399
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,661
-  How do
we look like that?

400
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:58,864
- Either your phone is messed up

401
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:01,066
or these edibles are
kicking in quick.

402
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:08,340
- What's going on?

403
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:11,276
- Some drama, that's
what's going on.

404
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:12,911
Here. Be quiet.

405
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:14,713
Let's keep exploring.

406
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:16,581
-  Uh, I don't
know about that.

407
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:23,922
- Oh, god! - Oh!

408
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:28,727
-  Wait, wait.
Josie, give me your phone.

409
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,928
- Um.

410
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:31,281
- Just give me
your phone. Josie.

411
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:38,937
Whoa, jeez! - Oh!

412
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,605
- What the F?! - God.

413
00:25:47,913 --> 00:25:49,848
They're scarecrows.

414
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:50,782
- What?

415
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:53,018
-  Just alone, in the bed.

416
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,020
Who does that?

417
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,955
-  It's freezing in here.

418
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:57,988
- Yeah.

419
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:04,629
And this vase must've blown
off the dresser from the wind.

420
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,198
- Yeah, those
windows aren't open.

421
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:11,036
Anyways, it still doesn't
explain the voices.

422
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:17,108
Guys, can we get
the hell outta here?

423
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:20,779
- Yeah, I don't like this.

424
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:22,881
- Yeah, I mean...

425
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,049
- Let's go, Ross.

426
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,116
- There's no more to see.

427
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:32,023
- I just can't get
enough of this place.

428
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:35,794
I can't. I wanna
just drink it all in.

429
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:39,064
Since we've been here,
I feel like I tapped

430
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,033
into a creative
reservoir inside of me.

431
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:46,771
- What about your new book?

432
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,010
Hello?

433
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:00,918
- It was rejected.

434
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,287
- What do you mean?

435
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,761
- My publisher hated it.

436
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,965
Hated it.

437
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:16,935
She said it was uninspired.

438
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:25,110
Actually, what she said
was that I phoned it in.

439
00:27:30,348 --> 00:27:34,719
So, yeah, I'm starting over.

440
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:38,923
- When did this happen?

441
00:27:38,957 --> 00:27:40,258
- Earlier this year.

442
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:46,831
- Why didn't you tell me?

443
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,404
- Because it's humiliating.

444
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:57,308
It's deflating.

445
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,250
I've still been trying to
process it for myself, I think.

446
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,788
But since we've been here,

447
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:17,996
for the first time
in a long, long time,

448
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,198
I feel like I have pages in me.

449
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:21,231
Great pages.

450
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:24,078
I wanna take a totally
different direction.

451
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:25,904
I don't wanna write
any more bland,

452
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:29,240
dry stories about
Western ghost towns.

453
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:30,508
I wanna make it personal.

454
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:35,847
- I'm sorry they didn't like it.

455
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:38,949
Fuck them.

456
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:44,254
- Yeah.

457
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,026
Yeah. Fuck them.

458
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,096
Yes!

459
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,164
- Yeah. - Fuck them.

460
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:56,568
- Fuck them. - Fuck 'em.

461
00:28:58,136 --> 00:28:59,070
Fuck them.

462
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,221
- Oh. You're drunk.

463
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:22,227
- Not really.

464
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,398
- Look, if this is gonna happen,

465
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,300
I just wanna take
it really slow.

466
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,302
Okay?

467
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,574
- We should go
check on the kids.

468
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:44,458
-  Do you
guys think it's true-

469
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:45,283
- What? - About Chris

470
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:47,252
and Marie Pannenbaker?

471
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,120
- No. - No, that's not true.

472
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,622
-  I wish it were true.

473
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:53,525
Means I might
actually have a shot.

474
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,202
- Well, why don't you just
date to guy your own age?

475
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:57,262
It might actually
work out for once.

476
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,597
- Guys in high school
aren't mature enough for me.

477
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,875
-  Really, no
one in high school's

478
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,100
mature enough for you?

479
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,268
-  Maybe at Hamilton.

480
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,605
-  I knew I
should've gone to Hamilton.

481
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,140
You know what?

482
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,011
I'm high as shit.

483
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:15,146
We are in the middle of
nowhere. Let's just go back.

484
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:18,016
-  What? Dude,
don't be a buzzkill.

485
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:21,953
-  Who are you right now?

486
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,122
- I don't know, but I'm
feeling kinda groovy.

487
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,157
- Yeah, girl.

488
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,160
-  What, you say "groovy"?

489
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:30,562
- Yeah. - Teala, no, no, no, no.

490
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:32,163
Okay, now I'm sticking around.

491
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:33,531
We don't say "groovy" anymore.

492
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,166
-  Well,
we're saying it now.

493
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,969
-  Let me teach
you what we do say, okay?

494
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,304
- What? - We say "lit."

495
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,371
-  Oh.

496
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:41,573
- All right? - Lit.

497
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:43,308
Lit, there we go.

498
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,442
-  Lit.

499
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,280
-  Hey,
guys, look at this.

500
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:54,052
-  Is that singing?

501
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:55,320
- Sounds like it.

502
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,957
- What did you put
in these edibles?

503
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:02,260
-  Couple of grams of
indica. And some THC powder.

504
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:04,596
I mean, they're
strong, but that's it.

505
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:07,398
- Guys, I'm either
tripping really hard,

506
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:11,102
or that sound is coming
from inside that barn.

507
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,372
- Oh, hell to the no.

508
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:16,541
- Oh, hell to the yes.

509
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:25,316
I'm going in. Who's with me?

510
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:28,586
-  Me.

511
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:30,754
- What?

512
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:33,457
Guys.

513
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,377
-  Singing stopped.

514
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,345
- Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.

515
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,228
- What's that? - What the F?!

516
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,329
- Shh, shh, shh.

517
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,003
- Holy shit!

518
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,706
Run, run!

519
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:24,575
-  Hey, hey, hey, whoa,
whoa, whoa! What's going on?!

520
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,010
- Mr. C... Okay.

521
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:26,611
-  I'm just
so glad you're here.

522
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:28,246
I was so freaked out.

523
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,723
- Okay, that's, all
right... There's something

524
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:31,416
fucked up in there, man.

525
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:33,284
- Like what?

526
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,321
- Fucked up!

527
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:38,656
Mr. C, the eyes...

528
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:42,727
- Mr. C, swear to God,
there's something in there.

529
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,462
-  Oh, shit.

530
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:58,742
- Chris?!

531
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,514
- They got him. I say we go.

532
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:04,482
- Chris!

533
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:09,453
- There's nothing.

534
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:11,422
Bunch of barn mice.

535
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:12,256
-  What?

536
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,092
- Yeah, some barn
mice from hell.

537
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,125
- No way.

538
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:19,697
- Have you been drinking?

539
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,065
- No. - No, no, no.

540
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:23,368
- Mm-hm. Breath check.

541
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:24,302
Ross.

542
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,470
- No, no, no, no, listen,

543
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,339
Ms. Harris, I haven't brushed
my teeth since we got here,

544
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:30,341
so for your own safety,
keep your distance.

545
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,410
You guys heard the
singing, right?

546
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:34,478
- Singing?

547
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:37,547
Why are your eyes red?

548
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:43,621
- I was in there and I had a
near death experience, Mr. C.

549
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:44,789
- We're high as shit!

550
00:33:44,822 --> 00:33:46,858
- Fuck! - Mm-hm.

551
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:48,535
-  They peer
pressured me to doing it.

552
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,429
- Wow, some team player you are.

553
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:53,741
- I worked way too hard to throw
everything away, all right?

554
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:56,734
I'm literally going to be
disowned by my parents.

555
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:00,471
Please. This can't
go on my record.

556
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:01,773
I have to get into Penn.

557
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,117
- 'Cause she wouldn't
have taken an edible

558
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:04,409
if I didn't force her.

559
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:05,877
Punish me.

560
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,888
I'm not going to college
anyways, so nothing to lose.

561
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:09,547
- What? No, no, no.

562
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,650
Look, it was my weed. That
shit was way too dank.

563
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:16,454
It's on me, okay?
Josie, I got this.

564
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:19,724
- Okay, okay. You guys, I
don't care whose idea it was.

565
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:20,858
It's not okay.

566
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:23,627
What should we do?

567
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:29,534
- Give a warning.

568
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,369
- A warning?

569
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,537
- What do you want do?

570
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:37,575
Yes, a warning. Yes, a big
fucking warning for each of you.

571
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:39,544
Let's go!

572
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,446
- Thank you so much. - Let's go!

573
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:44,382
- Ms...
-  No. Turn and walk.

574
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,451
I don't even wanna hear it.

575
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:47,852
Chris, you're running a jungle.

576
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:51,155
Walk. Please.

577
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:52,290
- There's... Please!

578
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:03,534
- We survived the night.

579
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:08,239
Generally, a good sign when
you're staying in a ghost town.

580
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,266
The kids reported a
couple of anomalies,

581
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:38,436
but I'm not sold on it.

582
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:42,640
When haven't you
been to a ghost town

583
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:44,609
that didn't try to
pull a fast one?

584
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,780
I know there's more
to you, Teardrop.

585
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:52,950
I just don't know where to look.

586
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:58,856
-  Wow. What time is it?

587
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:01,826
-  Good morning, pumpkin.

588
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:04,629
- What's up, Mr. C?

589
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:05,997
-  You ready?

590
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,632
-  Ready for what?

591
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,946
- We're touring the town.
We're waiting on you. Let's go.

592
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,569
- Wait.

593
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:13,337
Mr. C, someone took my pains.

594
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:17,008
I need-

595
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:22,246
- There's the general store,
courthouse, livery stable.

596
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:25,716
Got the old mine shaft
about a quarter mile off.

597
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,485
All inoperable.

598
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:34,659
- What's still open?
- The saloon, the hotel.

599
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,261
That's what everyone wants.
A drink and a warm bed.

600
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:41,332
- What about the cabin that
the girls are staying in?

601
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,533
What's up with that?

602
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:46,470
- That belonged to the old judge
of teardrop. Judge Wincott.

603
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,343
Or the Hanging Judge, as
they liked to call him.

604
00:36:53,477 --> 00:36:54,845
See the guy gallows over there?

605
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,382
That's where one of the
most horrific hangings

606
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,750
took place long ago.

607
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:11,662
She was his wife.

608
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:22,974
She told him he would pay for
what he did, they all would.

609
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:47,665
And "no one would ever
leave this place."

610
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:02,980
- That's it?! You're gonna
leave us on a cliffhanger?

611
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,882
- Your stay's not over yet.

612
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:08,819
- Why'd he hang her, Denver?

613
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:14,692
- Hey, Mr. C, that
guy's a weirdo.

614
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:16,394
- Be respectful.

615
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:18,729
- I agree, he's so weird.
- That guy is such a weirdo.

616
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:19,763
- I don't...

617
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:03,873
- Mm.

618
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:10,748
Chris?

619
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:14,918
I hear you.

620
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:21,758
Don't say a word.

621
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:36,540
This is what you wanted
all along, right?

622
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:42,713
Well, that's all you get
for now, you dirty perv.

623
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:50,788
Chris?

624
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,992
- Yo, you need help?

625
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:29,025
-  No.

626
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:31,694
- Okay.

627
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:37,268
- Sorry. I forget who I'm
supposed to be sometimes.

628
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:38,969
- Ah, anxiety.

629
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:42,039
Yeah, I suffer from it too.

630
00:40:43,307 --> 00:40:45,509
I even wrote something about it.

I try.

641
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,901
I try really hard, actually.

642
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:17,842
- Hey, I get it. People
often think I'm two-faced.

643
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,944
- I don't think
you're two-faced.

I mean, I act like
a douchebag because,

I don't know, I think
it makes me look cool.

647
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:35,793
- Oh, no shot. You don't
know what a douchebag is?

648
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,262
What...

649
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:39,295
No way.

- Whoa. Hey, he should not
be talking to you like that.

658
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,058
- He thinks he's my
dad or something.

659
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:15,633
- Hey. Denver, that's
what a douchebag is.

660
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,033
-  Now!

661
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:20,604
- Come to the cemetery tonight.

662
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:24,808
- The cemetery? Tonight?

663
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,878
You're totally a weirdo.

664
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:30,947

you told us about?

- I don't know.

672
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:31,408
- Okay, Chris, let's call it.

673
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,977
Let's get the hell outta Dodge.

674
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:35,312

You can come back on your
own and write your book.

677

Without us.

678
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,266
- It's not just about my book.

679
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:59,169
- What are you talking about?

680
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,496
- Found this in my
grandfather's basement.

681
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:03,300
That letter was
written in this hotel.

682
00:45:04,234 --> 00:45:05,869
More than a century ago.

683
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:10,007
- I don't understand.

684
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,511
- Becca, I've been looking for
this place for years. Years.

685
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,213
It's not online anywhere.

686
00:45:16,246 --> 00:45:19,016
It's not in maps.
It's not in books.

687
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:20,918
Okay? Nowhere.

688
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:22,820
- You're not making any sense.

689
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:24,221
- Read the letter.

690
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:26,090
Read the letter.

691
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:28,525
- Jeez Louise. Okay.

692
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:35,833
"My dearest son, I
am sending you away

693
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:38,402
from this wicked place.

694
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:40,938
Promise me you will
never come back here.

695
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:46,810
Your loving mother, Alice."

696
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:49,011
- Alice.

697
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:52,148
Alice.

698
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:58,889
Rebecca, I think that Alice
is my great-grandmother.

699
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:03,427
Alice that's on the
portrait in the hallway.

700
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:06,530
Alice that was... Who
was hung to death.

701
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:08,832
- Yes. Yes.

702
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:18,942
She gave up her son to get
him away from this place.

703
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:21,545
That baby was my grandfather.

704
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,461
She wrote this letter to give
him when he was old enough.

705
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:33,323
I think that Alice got my
grandfather out of here

706
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:34,958
before she cursed this town.

707
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:37,060
- My god, you don't
really believe in curses?

708
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,866
- I'll tell you what I do know,

709
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,235
is that the town of Teardrop
began to wither away

710
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:47,271
pretty quickly after that,

711
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:50,240
along with its history
and everyone in it.

712
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:56,380
- You shouldn't have
brought the students here.

713
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:57,581
- I know that.

714
00:46:57,614 --> 00:46:59,283
- Do you understand
how this looks?

715
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:01,618
- Yes. Abso-fucking-lutely
insane.

716
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,329
- Why are you putting
me in this position?

717
00:47:03,353 --> 00:47:06,056
- Because this is
my family, Rebecca.

718
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:08,458
This is my past.
This is my history.

719
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:12,930
Rebecca, I can't leave here yet.

720
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:17,201
Please. Please, you
have to understand.

721
00:47:17,234 --> 00:47:19,102
I can't go. Not yet.

722
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:22,339
- I wish you would've told me.

723
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:27,311
- I should have... Stop.

724
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,344
Enough.

725
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:32,149
- Rebecca, please.

726
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:42,226
- Okay. We stay,
but it's for you.

727
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:44,294
- Thank you.

728
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,300
- Where's Teala?

729
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:35,238
- I don't know. She
wanted to study outside.

730
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:39,810
- I told you not to
split up.

731
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:44,281
Have you seen Teala?

732
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:45,314
- No.

733
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:49,086
I'll go look for her.

734
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:55,257
- What?

735
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:51,381
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

736
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:55,519
Hey, are you all right?

737
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,387
What happened?

738
00:50:57,421 --> 00:50:59,423
- I don't know, I just...

739
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:00,257
- Okay, okay. Listen.

740
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:01,658
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.

741
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:03,493
You're okay. You're okay.

742
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:05,362
Listen to me. We're going back.

743
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,273
We're gonna stay in groups
of at least two from now on.

744
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:08,198
Okay? Let's go back.

745
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,500
You're okay. You're okay.

746
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,500
It's just a rough
idea right now, okay?

747
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:46,403
I'm probably gonna rewrite this
a dozen times, but it would-

748
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:47,604
- It's fantastic.

749
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:50,306
- Is it?

750
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:52,476
- It is.

751
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:03,320
- God. Thank you
for reading that.

752
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:06,289
- Thanks for letting me.

753
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:08,457
- Your usual?

754
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:11,828
- It's 3:45 p.m.

755
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:16,600
- Yeah, Denver. Gonna
hold off for a while.

756
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:19,935
- Whatever you say.

757
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:24,674
-  But while
you're here...

758
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:25,708
-  Mm-hm?

759
00:52:27,444 --> 00:52:29,513
- Why don't you tell
us why you hung her?

760
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:35,418
- You have a fetish for this
ghost story stuff, don't you?

761
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:39,856
- You gonna make me ask again?

762
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:41,291
- Don't get angry on me.

763
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,627
- I'm not.

764
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,663
- The last thing I ever
want to do is get you upset.

765
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:48,532
- I'm not angry.

766
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:50,567
- All right. I'll tell you.

767
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:53,470
Just don't quote me in
your book or anything.

768
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:56,606
I prefer to be left anonymous.

769
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:03,246
The Hanging Judge didn't
have a trace of empathy.

770
00:53:04,548 --> 00:53:06,416
Merciless.

771
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:10,720
But it wasn't just the
sinners who feared his wrath.

772
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:13,590
It was his own
flesh and blood too.

773
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:20,363
By the time Lorelei was eight,
he had grown to hate her.

774
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,532
Plagued him like a disease.

775
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:31,708
So disgusted by what he created,

776
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:35,378
he could only do the
one thing he knew how.

777
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:48,792
Screamed, "Cry!

778
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:54,531
Why won't you cry?!"

779
00:54:00,503 --> 00:54:02,739
No matter how hard
he ever beat her,

780
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:07,777
she wouldn't do it,
or couldn't do it.

781
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:13,917
He murdered his
daughter that night.

782
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:18,922
They say the judge had no
sorrow, not even a single tear.

783
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,603
Of course, no one dared question

784
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:35,739
the word of the Hanging Judge.

785
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:41,611
Poor Alice took the blame.

786
00:54:44,814 --> 00:54:46,750
Her cries could be
heard across Teardrop.

787
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:52,055
No worse sound than a
mother losing her child.

788
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,025
- What about the baby?

789
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:57,127
-  "What
about the baby?"

790
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,729
- The baby, did he
make it out alive?

791
00:54:59,763 --> 00:55:01,531
- You're living
proof, my friend.

792
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:04,434
- What do you mean?

793
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,803
- I knew the moment you
stepped foot in my bar.

794
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:09,906
You look just like him.

795
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:12,709
It's remarkable.

796
00:55:16,713 --> 00:55:19,049
- How do you know what the
Hanging Judge looks like?

797
00:55:19,082 --> 00:55:20,750
- Photos were left behind.

798
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:24,087
I reckon Chris
could show you some

799
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,556
of the old newspapers
he's been finding.

800
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:37,934
- Ugh, what a trip this
has turned out to be.

801
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:40,003
I'm gonna be so heated
if next year's class gets

802
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:42,105
to go to, like,
Hawaii or something.

803
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:44,850
-  You're just mad
Mr. C won't get with you.

804
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:48,445
- Hey, I may have lost the
battle, but not the war.

805
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:53,817
- Okay. You're kinda like
the female General Custard.

806
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:56,719
- Who's that?

807
00:55:58,121 --> 00:56:01,858
- Do you, like, not pay any
attention in class at all?

808
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:04,794
- Hey, school isn't as important
as real life experience.

809
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:15,772
Oh, I'm sorry.

810
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:17,140
I didn't mean to...

811
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:19,909
- Oh. It's fine.

812
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:22,011
Happened a long time ago.

813
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:27,150
- I've been told I'm a great
listener. Amongst other things.

814
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:37,527
- I've been having some weird
thoughts since we got here.

815
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:40,230
- Like suicidal thoughts?

816
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:41,263
- Sorta.

817
00:56:42,966 --> 00:56:46,736
I know them really
well, so it's scary.

818
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:51,841
- Well, you know what I think?

819
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:54,944
I think you put too much
pressure on yourself.

820
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:56,021
I mean, you're never
gonna look back

821
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:57,847
and care about your GPA.

822
00:56:57,881 --> 00:57:00,116
3.8, 3.9, what's the difference?

823
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,150
- Weighted 4.0.

824
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:04,087
- Okay. Well, live a little.

825
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,956
I mean, be dumb and
stupid for a change.

826
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:10,126
All those bad thoughts
will go away. Promise.

827
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:16,132
- Look what I found. Who's
down to get old school drunk?

828
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:22,071
- Never have I ever
dated a college boy.

829
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:26,609
- College boys, no. But
college girls, several.

830
00:57:26,643 --> 00:57:28,077
- Several. - Several.

831
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,012
-  Drink up, then.

832
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:30,747
- All right.

833
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:35,618
- Okay, my turn. Never have
I ever tried to kill myself.

834
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:37,153
- The hell? Josie.

835
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:38,221
- What? It's true.

836
00:57:38,254 --> 00:57:39,889
I haven't.
- No, that's not cool.

837
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:41,200
I don't care.
- I'm not ashamed of it.

838
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:43,026
- Yeah. See, Ross,
she doesn't care.

839
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,029
- Okay. Then I got one.

840
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:50,567
Never have I ever been a ho.

841
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:53,236
Drink up, skank.

842
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:54,971
- Fuck you, asshole!

843
00:57:55,004 --> 00:57:56,105
- Fuck you.

844
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,850
You're a DNA dumpster, and
that's all you're good for.

845
00:57:57,874 --> 00:57:59,242
- What, because
I won't blow you?

846
00:57:59,275 --> 00:58:00,275
- No...

847
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:03,213
All right, screw you.

848
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:04,981
And you know what?
Screw you too.

849
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:06,182
I stood up for you.

850
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:08,885
Get outta my way.

851
00:58:08,918 --> 00:58:10,954
- No. - All right, you bitch.

852
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:14,224
I got a date with the
maid, so I'll see ya.

853
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:21,030
- What a dick.

854
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:22,932
God.

855
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:27,937
- Well, was fun while it lasted.

856
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:29,005
- Oh, shut up.

857
00:58:56,766 --> 00:58:59,002
-  Winifred Carmine. 1802.

858
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:06,185
Would've never predicted
this, would you, Winifred?

859
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,677
- Careful where you step.

860
00:59:11,114 --> 00:59:13,116
Gone doesn't mean
they're gone away.

861
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:16,185
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have done that.

862
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,987
-  Don't apologize to me.

863
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:27,630
- Winifred, I apologize.

864
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:31,768
Do you want, are you
old enough to drink?

865
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:35,071
- On some days.

866
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:39,208
- Okay. Well, how
about this one?

867
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:42,311
- Nope.

868
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:47,216
- Yeah, that's probably
a pretty good idea.

869
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:50,029
I really shouldn't be
drinking this either.

870
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:51,988
I mean, this was
my dad's poison.

871
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:55,792
He's a dry fucking
drunk now, so...

872
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:05,768
It's just so exhausting
being young, you know?

873
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:12,141
Like, sometimes, I wish I could
just push a button and bang.

874
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:18,281
I'm married and have a kid

875
01:00:18,314 --> 01:00:22,085
and I just have
my shit together.

876
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:25,888
- Being old isn't all that
it's cracked up to be.

877
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:32,028
Your body starts to rot,
desiccate, and smell funny.

878
01:00:38,101 --> 01:00:42,472
- Oh, gosh. You are unlike
anyone I have ever met before.

879
01:00:42,505 --> 01:00:44,016
- I can be someone
else if you'd like.

880
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,241
- No. No, no, no.

881
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:46,776
Just be yourself.

882
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:49,045
That's what I'm into.

883
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:51,214
- How do I do that?

884
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:59,122
- Now, that is a
damn good question.

885
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:02,692
I don't even know sometimes.

886
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:05,994
I mean...

887
01:01:11,534 --> 01:01:12,969
You know, you were right.

888
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:18,908
This is peaceful.

889
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:24,981
- Wait until the sun sets.

890
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:26,349
- Mm.

891
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:28,985
I'll be waiting on bated breath.

892
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:32,088
- A fading sun is the one
pure thing in this world.

893
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:38,194
It's the last thing you
see on the hanging tree.

894
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:43,466
- On the hanging, what?

895
01:01:45,268 --> 01:01:47,070
- I'm not good at this.

896
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:48,037
- No, it's all right.

897
01:01:48,071 --> 01:01:49,505
I'm not good at a lot of...

898
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:52,909
Hey, where are you going?

899
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,043
-  Catch me!

900
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:58,214
- Catch you? Okay.

901
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,387
I'm really fast, actually.

902
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:08,990
Where'd you go?!

903
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:21,170
Hey.

904
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:25,808
Excuse me? Have you seen a maid?

905
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:26,842
Holy shit!

906
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:30,345
Oh, fuck.

907
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:34,283
Where's the maid?

908
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:52,869
- Is that Ross?

909
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:56,605
Oh, my god.

910
01:02:58,374 --> 01:03:00,176
-  Hey,
hey! You all right?

911
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:01,386
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

912
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:03,279
- Okay.
- Not that great, all right.

913
01:03:03,312 --> 01:03:04,523
Whoa, whoa, watch your chain.
- Take it slow.

914
01:03:04,547 --> 01:03:06,149
- Watch your chain.
- Wait, my chain.

915
01:03:06,182 --> 01:03:07,016
Can you get my chain?

916
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:09,152
- No, I'm not gonna
touch that. Get up.

917
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:10,353
Get up. You good?

918
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:12,054
- Yeah.
- What have you been doing?

919
01:03:12,088 --> 01:03:13,122
-  I'm good.

920
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:17,193
Just too much sauce
for Ross the Boss.

921
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:19,538
- Too much sauce?
- Yeah, I don't think

922
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:21,631
any of that is funny, Ross.

923
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,169
-  Where
have you two been?

924
01:03:26,202 --> 01:03:27,236
- Stop it.

925
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:30,649
- Making sure your friend
doesn't have alcohol poisoning.

926
01:03:30,673 --> 01:03:32,074
- Yeah, I'm sorry, Josie.

927
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:33,075
I didn't mean what

928
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:35,044
I said earlier.
- You smell like a frat party.

929
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:37,180
- Guys, what in the
hell is going on here?

930
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:40,950
I was 18 once. I
get it, all right?

931
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:43,319
But with the drinking,
with the weed?

932
01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:46,255
What do I need to do here? Huh?

933
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:47,957
Do I need to be the bad teacher?

934
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:50,059
Calls you guys in?
Gets you suspended?

935
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:51,294
-  It's just some-

936
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:52,687
- I don't wanna
hear it right now.

937
01:03:55,097 --> 01:03:56,966
Do you have anything
to add, Ms. Harris?

938
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:00,236
- We leave bright
and early tomorrow.

939
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:02,171
Set your alarms for 6:00 a.m.

940
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:05,074
- Wait. I thought we were
in leaving Sunday morning?

941
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:06,209
- Executive decision.

942
01:04:45,314 --> 01:04:47,984
- Been having these migraines
since I've been here.

943
01:04:49,485 --> 01:04:50,486
In Teardrop.

944
01:04:56,025 --> 01:04:57,660
I feel this rage.

945
01:04:57,693 --> 01:05:00,630
It's coming over me, thinking
about our time together.

946
01:05:00,663 --> 01:05:02,131
It's almost over.

947
01:05:03,766 --> 01:05:04,967
I can't leave yet.

948
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:09,705
I feel like if I do, I'm
not gonna get to come back.

949
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,477
And I still have
so many questions.

950
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:25,021
- Um, okay, how about
C?

951
01:05:25,054 --> 01:05:26,054
- There is a C.

952
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:30,059
Hey, I told you there's a C.

953
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:31,427
- There's a C? - Yeah.

954
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:36,431
-  Okay.

955
01:06:57,146 --> 01:06:58,280
-  Chris?

956
01:06:58,314 --> 01:07:01,183
- No. - Mr. C.

957
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:02,651
-  Chris!

958
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,420
- No. Wait!

959
01:07:04,453 --> 01:07:05,453
Rebecca!

960
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:08,124
Rebecca.

961
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:10,726
Rebecca... Get off of me!

962
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,437
- I didn't do anything. I
didn't touch her, I swear.

963
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:14,397
- I don't believe you, Chris!

964
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:16,732
I don't believe a single
word out of your mouth!

965
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:19,535
- I saw her. I saw Lorelei.

966
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:22,605
- You are fucking unbelievable!

967
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:24,240
And it's a shame too

968
01:07:24,273 --> 01:07:26,242
because I was just
starting to like you.

969
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:29,545
- I saw her! I fucking saw
her in the bathtub inside!

970
01:07:29,578 --> 01:07:32,448
- I knew what you were, I
should've trusted my gut.

971
01:07:33,416 --> 01:07:34,683
I'm such a sucker.

972
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:35,818
- You knew what I was?

973
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:38,354
I wouldn't make this up.

974
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:41,457
- You're a writer, it's
what you fucking do!

975
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:42,525
It's over.

976
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:46,595
- Where are you going?!

977
01:07:46,629 --> 01:07:47,630
- Far away from you!

978
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:12,531
-  Ms. Harris.
What's going on?

979
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:13,555
- Ask Chris.

980
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:17,130
Is there any way you could
drive me to the nearest town?

981
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:20,529
- As far as I can take you.

982
01:08:20,563 --> 01:08:21,864
- Thank you.

983
01:08:29,538 --> 01:08:31,507
Beautiful car.

984
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:34,443
-  A nice old
gentleman left it years back.

985
01:08:34,477 --> 01:08:36,345
Still hasn't returned for it.

986
01:08:37,546 --> 01:08:40,449
I figure he'll thank me for
keeping the engine warm.

987
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:47,590
-  What is it?

988
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:49,792
- Can't go any
further than this.

989
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:52,528
- Oh. I'll pay you.

990
01:08:53,762 --> 01:08:55,731
- Not about money.

991
01:08:55,764 --> 01:08:57,199
- What is it about, then?

992
01:08:58,567 --> 01:09:01,303
- I feel uncomfortable
leaving the hotel.

993
01:09:02,838 --> 01:09:04,340
I'm sure you can relate.

994
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:07,308
- I can't.

995
01:09:08,444 --> 01:09:10,546
- This is the best
I can do for you.

996
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:14,817
- Seriously? I could've
walked this far.

997
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:17,820
- Truly and deeply sorry.

998
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:24,326
-  Thanks.

999
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:09,305
-  Nothing even
happened between us.

1000
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:11,907
You caught a look, big deal.

1001
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:15,344
-  So, Mr. C
accidentally walks in on you,

1002
01:10:15,377 --> 01:10:18,047
so has the entire
graduating class.

1003
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,282
- Watch it.

1004
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:21,717
It's not funny.

1005
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:22,985
-  It's just a brush.

1006
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:26,722
- Mr. C.

1007
01:10:27,990 --> 01:10:30,359
- Chris.

1008
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:32,027
You can call me Chris.

1009
01:10:33,829 --> 01:10:35,497
- Are you seeing things too?

1010
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:40,735
- No.

1011
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:47,576
I think we all need
to get some shuteye.

1012
01:10:51,847 --> 01:10:55,718
Moving back to my room. You
guys stay outta trouble.

1013
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:57,886
- Hey, Mr. C, I was thinking

1014
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,623
that I would just stay
here with the girls

1015
01:11:00,656 --> 01:11:01,991
so you can be alone.

1016
01:11:04,526 --> 01:11:05,526
- Sure.

1017
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:07,896
Why the hell not?

1018
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:09,298
-  Okay.

1019
01:14:03,138 --> 01:14:04,840
- Ross! Teala's gone!

1020
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:06,942
- Oh, shit.

1021
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,211
Hey! Teala!

1022
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:29,198
- Pack your shit.

1023
01:14:29,231 --> 01:14:30,699
We're getting outta here.

1024
01:14:31,867 --> 01:14:33,936
Now. Let's go.

1025
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:36,939
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1026
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:45,012
-  Ross.

1027
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:48,984
- Hey. We're getting
the fuck outta here.

1028
01:14:49,017 --> 01:14:50,017
You should come.

1029
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:55,824
-  Follow me.

1030
01:14:55,858 --> 01:14:57,926
- Hey! What are you doing?!

1031
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:03,098
Wait!

1032
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,667
- Does this phone work?

1033
01:15:07,202 --> 01:15:08,837
Hello?

1034
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:11,840
Hello?

1035
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:13,017
Hello?!

1036
01:15:13,876 --> 01:15:16,578
Fuck!

1037
01:15:16,612 --> 01:15:17,980
- Who are you trying to call?

1038
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:18,981
-  The police.

1039
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:20,816
- Now, why would you do that?

1040
01:15:22,784 --> 01:15:25,020
- 'Cause there's a
fucking dead girl outside.

1041
01:15:37,666 --> 01:15:39,334
- This is Denver speaking.

1042
01:15:40,669 --> 01:15:41,669
Mm-hm.

1043
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:45,240
Mm, he's right here.

1044
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:50,078
Yes, it is crazy how
much like him he looks.

1045
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:53,214
All right.

1046
01:15:55,984 --> 01:15:57,653
She wants to talk to you.

1047
01:15:59,021 --> 01:16:00,155
- Who is that?

1048
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:19,308
Hello?

1049
01:16:19,341 --> 01:16:21,910
-  It was nice
to see your face.

1050
01:16:21,944 --> 01:16:24,212
You have turned
into a handsome man.

1051
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:25,981
Just like your grandfather.

1052
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:26,949
- Who is this?

1053
01:16:26,982 --> 01:16:28,951
-  You know who
this is, my darling.

1054
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:33,922
- What the fuck's
happening here?

1055
01:16:33,956 --> 01:16:35,991
- Same thing that
happens every time.

1056
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:42,898
The faces are new, but
it always ends the same.

1057
01:16:53,175 --> 01:16:54,175
- Josie?

1058
01:16:55,711 --> 01:16:56,878
Josie, we've gotta go.

1059
01:17:05,988 --> 01:17:09,224
Listen, I know you
feel guilty, all right?

1060
01:17:09,257 --> 01:17:10,425
But...

1061
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:07,816
- Wait! Come with us!

1062
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:09,284
Hey! Wait!

1063
01:18:10,385 --> 01:18:12,220
Hey, just hold on.

1064
01:18:12,254 --> 01:18:13,855
Hold on. Hey.

1065
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:16,224
Just, please, just listen to me.

1066
01:18:18,894 --> 01:18:20,128
-  Lower your lantern.

1067
01:18:20,162 --> 01:18:21,396
- What...

1068
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:22,330
No, I'm not gonna
lower the lantern.

1069
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:24,099
-  Pretty please?

1070
01:18:24,132 --> 01:18:27,035
You'll go wild for
this. Everyone does.

1071
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:31,872
No cheating.

1072
01:18:32,441 --> 01:18:33,909
- What's that voice?

1073
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:38,847
- Lift your lantern.

1074
01:18:41,983 --> 01:18:45,253
I can be someone else
instead. Whoever you want.

1075
01:18:47,255 --> 01:18:51,259
All of us were hung at the
neck, it's the worst way to go.

1076
01:18:56,098 --> 01:18:58,166
With everyone watching,

1077
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,302
with everyone laughing
as you squirm.

1078
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:05,240
They're all me. And I'm them.

1079
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:12,814
- Stop, you fucking freak!

1080
01:19:13,615 --> 01:19:14,983
- I was a freak.

1081
01:19:17,285 --> 01:19:19,221
You're gonna wish
you got the rope.

1082
01:19:37,405 --> 01:19:40,308
-  No, no! Oh, god, no!

1083
01:19:57,159 --> 01:19:58,326
- You're dead.

1084
01:20:00,061 --> 01:20:01,930
You've been dead
for a hundred years.

1085
01:20:31,059 --> 01:20:32,059
-  Ross?!

1086
01:20:33,628 --> 01:20:34,628
Ross!

1087
01:20:36,264 --> 01:20:37,299
Rebecca?!

1088
01:20:39,634 --> 01:20:43,405
- I will not be the scapegoat
for what you've done.

1089
01:20:43,438 --> 01:20:44,606
- What I have done?

1090
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:48,009
- You have killed, Judge.

1091
01:20:52,647 --> 01:20:54,082
- What did you do to me?!

1092
01:20:54,115 --> 01:20:57,085
- I myself have
not done a thing.

1093
01:20:57,118 --> 01:21:00,488
I told you to leave
while you still could.

1094
01:21:03,058 --> 01:21:04,192
Your usual, sir?

1095
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:11,699
- No. No!

1096
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:12,426
- Chris!

1097
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:14,996
What time is it?

1098
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:17,999
-  You! You did it to us!

1099
01:22:18,033 --> 01:22:20,135
- I need to know
the time, Chris,

1100
01:22:20,168 --> 01:22:22,470

it a hair pass 10.
