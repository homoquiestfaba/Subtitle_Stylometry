1
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,718
<i>High school.</i>

2
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,593
<i>It happens to everyone.</i>

3
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,712
<i>And for four years,</i>
<i>it has a way of dividing us.</i>

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,552
<i>Athletes, overachievers,</i>
<i>drama queens, misfits, jokers...</i>

5
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,034
<i>But then, just before it ends,</i>

6
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,559
<i>when we're almost out the door...</i>

7
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,595
<i>... one night has a way</i>
<i>of bringing us together.</i>

8
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,310
<i>Prom.</i>

9
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,753
<i>It's the one night</i>
<i>when nobody cares</i>

10
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,758
<i>who wore the varsity jacket</i>
<i>and who got cut from the team.</i>

11
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,438
<i>It's the night when</i>
<i>you might find yourself</i>

12
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,234
<i>singing at the top of your lungs with</i>
<i>people you've never even spoken to.</i>

13
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,119
<i>The night when that cute guy</i>

14
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,833
<i>from your math class</i>
<i>might finally make his move.</i>

15
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,519
<i>Prom's our night,</i>

16
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,273
<i>and each of us wants it</i>
<i>to be unforgettable.</i>

17
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,391
<i>That's why I've been working</i>
<i>all semester to make it perfect.</i>

18
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,272
<i>For me, and for all the seniors</i>
<i>at Brookside High.</i>

19
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,475
Hey, Nova.

20
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,792
<i>We were three weeks away</i>
<i>and everything was going as planned.</i>

21
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,429
<i>Well, almost everything.</i>

22
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,955
Has he asked you yet?

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,592
It's 8.00 a.m.

24
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,552
He will!
You guys are perfect together.

25
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,713
You're in all the same
AP classes, swim team co-captains,

26
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,116
you've both been, like, class
everything since kindergarten.

27
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,276
Trust me, it's going to happen.

28
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,514
Has he asked you yet?

29
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,477
Well, he will.

30
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,839
He's never once made a move.

31
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,836
Well, he's Brandon. He's shy.

32
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,470
Or, maybe he's just not interested.

33
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,112
Don't you want him to ask you?

34
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,670
Yes, I want him to ask me. It's prom!

35
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,679
Here he comes.

36
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,199
Hey, Nova!

37
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,430
- It's happening.
- Bye.

38
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,711
Wow. Beautiful.

39
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,512
Brandon! Thanks.

40
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,870
Posters look great. Nice job.

41
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,909
Yeah.

42
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,474
I'm gonna do the cafeteria.

43
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,635
Oh.

44
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,797
You know, Rachel, I found that prom
dress you were talking about.

45
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,836
Thanks, Nova. We'll be there.

46
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,390
You know, you could go.

47
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,873
No, thank you.

48
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,753
Prom's like
the Olympics of high school.

49
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,712
You wait four years,
three people have a good time,

50
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,354
and everybody else gets to live
on with shattered dreams.

51
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,278
My stepbrother, folks.
Can you believe he's single?

52
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,710
Come on, Lloyd. Your fear of girls
has gone from cute to clinical.

53
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,988
It's just prom.

54
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,510
Ask somebody. And be creative.

55
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,075
This is your last chance to make anyone
remember you even went here.

56
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,236
Wow. Nova, that looks awesome.

57
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,317
Thanks. Make sure you and Tyler
aren't too late.

58
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,069
We crown prom king and queen
at 9.35. Just saying.

59
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,037
Hey! My queen!

60
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,989
Hey, Tyler.

61
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,792
- Hi, Tyler.
- What's up, man?

62
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,398
So, I saw the posters,

63
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,953
and I thought about you.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,592
And about a party bus.

65
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,914
Oh, yeah!

66
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,633
Hey, Tyler, can we talk?

67
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,672
OK, so you can only listen
to one artist for the rest of your life,

68
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,188
- and Stick Hippo does not exist. Go.
- Oh, man.

69
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,390
No Stick Hippo, the
greatest band of all time?

70
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,633
Jack White. You get three
epic bands, and counting.

71
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,353
Lucas, you blow my mind every day.

72
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,951
OK, next one. Grunge rock supergroup,
1990-96, no Dave Grohl. Go.

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,560
Good one. OK, how 'bout...

74
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,589
Look at them.

75
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,153
I want to go to prom.

76
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,794
Well, Megan Brooks went
when she was a sophomore.

77
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,955
So it can totally happen.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,673
It's like they're in a trance.

79
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,709
Yeah.

80
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,239
- See you later.
- Bye.

81
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,431
- Lucas, you gotta ask her out.
- Dude, you're crazy.

82
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,153
She doesn't want to go out with me.
I've got nothing to offer.

83
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,919
No car, no cool parties, no prom.

84
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,549
Check it out.

85
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,476
Prom this year
is gonna be so much fun.

86
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:28,072
Oh, my gosh. I really want to go
with Dakota. That'd be amazing.

87
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,551
Hey, Rhoda,
I turned 18 last week.

88
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,999
You know what that means, right?

89
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,508
They can try you as an adult?

90
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,949
Rhoda! You break my heart.

91
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,395
It means we can
finally run away together.

92
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,113
You, me, the open road.

93
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,717
So, what are you in for?

94
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,552
Let me guess.
Trouble at the model UN?

95
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,750
Prom poster crisis?

96
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,712
Wait, I know.

97
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,354
You're receiving an award
for most awards.

98
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,789
Actually, I'm in trouble this time.

99
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,795
Really?

100
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,831
They caught me riding around
school on my little moped

101
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,950
- because I think I'm such a rebel.
- It's not a moped.

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,195
It's a 1972 Norton Commando.

103
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,639
It's adorable.

104
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,593
Jesse Richter? My office, now.

105
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,594
Nova, I'll have those papers
for you by lunch.

106
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,873
Richter, Richter, Richter.

107
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,198
Let's see.

108
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,795
"Jesse has cut last period

109
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,434
every Monday for four weeks."

110
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,074
- You know what this means?
- I'm consistent?

111
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,395
You do realise you're only
cheating yourself, right?

112
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,318
You know, I had a talk
with myself about that.

113
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,033
Turns out I'm OK with it.

114
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,911
I don't have time for this.

115
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,548
Today it's cutting class. Last month
it's fighting in the cafeteria?

116
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,717
You don't care about anything.
And you and I both know...

117
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,672
...you're going nowhere.

118
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,234
The good news is,
the really good news,

119
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,350
in a month and a half,
that's not gonna be my problem

120
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,359
'cause I'm going on vacation,
and you are gonna disappear forever.

121
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,709
You wanna do that with
a diploma, that's up to you.

122
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,753
Six weeks, Richter. Six weeks.
Do you think you can handle that?

123
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,236
Yeah. I'll leave this place
in one piece for ya.

124
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,479
Because in September,
you're gonna be right back here.

125
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,193
Get to class.

126
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,313
What is this?

127
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,279
An earring?

128
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,118
Very good.
Why was it in your car?

129
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,950
Wait, I know. I drove half the girls'
soccer team to Papa Gino's last week.

130
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,755
You did?

131
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,997
Yes, OK? Now stop acting crazy.
You know you're my girl.

132
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,077
And you're gonna be the prom queen,
up there looking beautiful.

133
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,713
What is it?

134
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,109
You need to ask me.

135
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,391
I know, OK? Don't worry.
I've got plans.

136
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,600
Here. For the soccer team.

137
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,068
I got it! I got it!

138
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,156
Pick it up.

139
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,035
Come on, you guys.

140
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,199
I got it. I got...

141
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,754
- OK.
- You guys got it?

142
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,756
- Yep. You guys all right?
- Yeah.

143
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,950
- Feel like I'm carrying all the weight.
- Me too.

144
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,399
I feel like you're
carrying all the weight.

145
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,429
Lower it.

146
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,118
- Careful of the stars.
- Let it down.

147
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,878
Hey, man, relax.

148
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,836
- OK.
- Are we... done?

149
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,474
- What?
- Well...

150
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,114
...that was the last
of our prom decorations.

151
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,593
But we still
have to figure out a floor plan,

152
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,278
come up with a schedule
of who's selling tickets,

153
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,629
get the voting system down
for prom king and queen, and...

154
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,114
But you know what?
I can totally do that stuff later.

155
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,958
So, you guys are... done.

156
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,115
Yay!

157
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,159
In three weeks, "Starry Night"
will be Brookside's best prom ever.

158
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,791
Our theme is "Starry Night"?

159
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,949
Yeah.

160
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,829
Cool.

161
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,757
I can't thank you guys enough
for all your hard work,

162
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,475
but when those couples walk through
the door and see how perfect it is,

163
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,715
it's gonna be so worth it.

164
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,197
Plus, you each get two
free tickets to prom. Ali.

165
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,559
Awesome. Thank you.

166
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,158
- Mei.
- Thank you.

167
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,156
- Rolo.
- Sweet!

168
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,589
- Brandon.
- Thank you.

169
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,356
So, Rolo, who are you
gonna take to prom?

170
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,709
My girlfriend. Athena.

171
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,796
- Athena?
- She's Greek.

172
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,919
And where does she live?

173
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,999
- Canada.
- So, she's Greek-Canadian?

174
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,600
There's a very vibrant
Greek culture in Canada.

175
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,238
Vibrant.

176
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,953
So, how did Justin take it when
you told him about New York?

177
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,798
I haven't exactly told him yet.

178
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,798
Mei, you have to tell him.

179
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,115
He thinks you're staying here
and going to Michigan with him.

180
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,197
You got into Parsons.
It's a huge deal.

181
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,515
I know, but I haven't
decided if I'm going.

182
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,233
It'll be like breaking up
with him. How can I do that?

183
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,874
Hey, hey, hey!
Prom's looking good.

184
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,956
Guess I better find
a hot girl to go with.

185
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,194
Right.

186
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,989
- What are you doing here?
- Come with me.

187
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,358
Bye, guys.

188
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,950
Right here.

189
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,994
- What's going on?
- You'll see.

190
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,558
"P." It's for
the paralysing crush I had

191
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,956
on the new girl in my math
class in the eighth grade.

192
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,391
Her name was Mei,
and she was awesome.

193
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,316
"R."

194
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,113
It's for the really long time it took me
to get up the nerve to ask her out.

195
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,071
"O" is for the only girl
I've ever called my girlfriend,

196
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,475
and the only one I ever want to.

197
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,069
And "M"...is for
University of Michigan, of course.

198
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,509
Because that's our
next chapter together.

199
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,315
But I'm getting ahead of myself,
because before graduation and college

200
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,511
and the rest of our lives together,
there's something that I need to ask.

201
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,037
Yes! Yes!

202
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,078
Hey! Hey! Prom?

203
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,678
Yes! Yes!

204
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,789
Yes!

205
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,360
- Yes!
- Oh, yeah.

206
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,109
Darrell. Come on.
Get him. Let's go.

207
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,232
Come on. Don't...

208
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,077
Darrell.
Darrell!

209
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,954
Looks like it's just us.

210
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,036
Yeah.

211
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,197
Do you have a minute? I was...
I was hoping to talk to you alone.

212
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,518
Yeah. Sure. What do you
want to talk about?

213
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,835
It's about prom.

214
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,711
Oh.

215
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,718
We've been working on the prom
committee now for several months,

216
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,955
and, since we're on the committee,

217
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,719
I think it's a good idea for us
to arrive a little early on prom night.

218
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,433
You know, make sure
everything's copacetic.

219
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,633
I suppose that makes sense.

220
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,798
So, driving-wise, we should go together.

221
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,548
You want to...

222
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,999
Carpool.

223
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,315
Right.

224
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,998
Well, you know, people
get so carried away

225
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,395
with the whole prom date thing.

226
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,351
I say why not be practical
about it, you know?

227
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,718
Brandon, I...

228
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,116
Is that a yes?

229
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,639
I'd love to.

230
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,669
OK, then.

231
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,758
Here you go.

232
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,832
Or do you want me to hold on to it?

233
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,559
So it's a date.

234
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,997
And Ethan got to be line leader
because it was his birthday.

235
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,918
But my birthday's in July,
which is totally unfair.

236
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,915
Totally.

237
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,555
Every summer birthday gets celebrated on
one day at the end of the school year.

238
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,876
And there are like six of us.
And two of them are girls.

239
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,558
And they made Mike S. line leader first

240
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,636
and his birthday
isn't even until August,

241
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,352
so I said... Mom!

242
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,675
- Hey!
- What are you doing home?

243
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,951
Well, the place was dead,
so Lou gave me the afternoon off.

244
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,594
- I actually get to see my kids.
- Cool!

245
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,392
You see what came in the mail?

246
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,314
Wanna try it on?

247
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,875
Nah. Since you're here,
I think I'll call work

248
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,592
and see if I can pick up
some extra hours.

249
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,993
Come on, sweetie.
Let's all take tonight off.

250
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,393
Who keeps opening this door?

251
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,875
There's nothing
but garbage down there.

252
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,832
Dad, if Mom got the hang
of this, then you can, too.

253
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,715
Here. Watch.

254
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,638
Just click this, and... There we are.

255
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,749
Wow.

256
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,197
- Hold on.
- What?

257
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,155
You just have a little grease.

258
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,394
See?

259
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,476
It's paying off already.

260
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,958
Boy. I don't know about this.

261
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,558
It's super easy.

262
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,672
Make sure I'm online. And then
choose me from the contacts menu.

263
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,473
And next fall, we can talk
whenever you want.

264
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,751
OK. How 'bout midnight?
Every night of the week.

265
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,112
I don't know about that, Dad.

266
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,232
Georgetown on a scholarship, boy.

267
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,874
It's just like we always
talked about, huh?

268
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,474
You heading off
to achieve great things.

269
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,236
It's the heading off part I'm just...

270
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,990
...having a little trouble with.
That's all.

271
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,035
Dad.

272
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:38,590
You deserve an awesome prom,
so... why wait?

273
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,709
Wow.

274
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,673
Tyler, this is beautiful.

275
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,838
Told you I had plans. And what is prom
without a romantic dinner?

276
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,353
You got Taco King.

277
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,550
Vegetarian burrito, extra guac.

278
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,232
So...

279
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,111
...will you go with me?
To prom?

280
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,957
Yes.

281
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,433
Come on.

282
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,798
Thanks, Tyler.

283
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,513
Whoa.

284
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,996
It's like Apocalypse Prom.

285
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,996
Hey, there.

286
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,996
How you doing, Nova?

287
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,632
Nova, what do we do now?

288
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,432
Yeah. Is prom, like, cancelled?

289
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,436
We could always postpone
till after graduation.

290
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,949
No.

291
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,070
I don't wanna tell
the entire senior class

292
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,429
to return their dresses,
cancel their dates.

293
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,358
- If we do that, then...
- The terrorists have won?

294
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,237
People are counting on us.

295
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,111
Prom's three weeks away.

296
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,594
So we work before school.
After school.

297
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,315
I would, but I can't.
I'm starting my internship.

298
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,476
And I'm...
I'm in the spring musical.

299
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,239
Yeah, man. I mean, this was already
my hardest class this semester.

300
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,909
I'm tapped out. I got nothing left.

301
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,716
Brandon?

302
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,878
Nova. AP tests are coming.
I'm already behind.

303
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,070
We need to get these kids
back into class, OK?

304
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,395
There has to be
something we can do.

305
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,829
Nova?

306
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,231
Mr Dunnan, the prom decorations
are completely destroyed.

307
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,157
Nova, I know.

308
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,078
The prom committee
worked very, very hard.

309
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,238
Everything was in that shed.
There's no one left to help me.

310
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,114
Mr Dunnan, what are we
gonna do? What are you...

311
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,513
- Bill.
- Sir.

312
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,996
- Principal Dunnan? Mr Dunnan?
- Richter!

313
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,792
Get that pile of junk
off of school grounds.

314
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,717
- You can't ride that back here.
- Right. Sorry.

315
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,672
Wouldn't want any school
property to get damaged.

316
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,756
You think it's funny
when people's hard work gets destroyed?

317
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,916
It's just a bunch
of dumb prom decorations.

318
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,671
Wait. No. Prom's ruined.

319
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,154
The boys and girls of Brookside
have been robbed of their right

320
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,634
to stand around in a gym
and drink punch.

321
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,235
Put the flags at half mast.

322
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,078
I got a better idea.
You're gonna help her rebuild.

323
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,951
- What?
- What?!

324
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,116
Nova, you need help.
Richter, you clearly need

325
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,116
a way to stay out of trouble
for the next couple of weeks.

326
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,152
Him? Mr Dunnan,
I really don't think he...

327
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,270
Little Miss Sunshine's right.
You should listen to her.

328
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,595
No. You're gonna do it.

329
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,278
Who knows?
You might even learn something

330
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,878
about hard work and dedication.

331
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,789
And if this prom isn't rebuilt to her
specifications, you won't graduate.

332
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,035
You can't do that! You can't
keep me from graduating.

333
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,389
You know what? I had a talk
with myself about that...

334
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,958
...turns out I'm OK with it.

335
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,798
Hey, guys.

336
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,670
Hi, you.

337
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,311
- What's with the helmets?
- Varsity made us wear them.

338
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,794
- It's... humiliating.
- I think it's cute.

339
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,389
Yeah? We could get you one.
Maybe it'll catch on.

340
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,274
Well, you could get
me pink. It'd match my outfit.

341
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,073
That'd be pretty. And safe.

342
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,395
Well, I need a serious cram session
for the elements test.

343
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,273
Yeah. Any time.
Just think of me as your lab partner.

344
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,117
You are my lab partner.

345
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,196
- Good point.
- I'll see you guys later.

346
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,713
Are you OK?

347
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,432
Yeah. Fine. Helmet.

348
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,832
Your sister's right.
There are tons of girls out there

349
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,552
who'd be thrilled to go
to prom with you.

350
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,591
All you have to do is ask one of them.

351
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,791
Thank you, Oprah,
for that nugget of wisdom.

352
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,718
You can do it.
Just be... Lloyd.

353
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,309
That hasn't exactly worked out
for me, like, ever.

354
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,033
She's right. It's not that hard.

355
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,436
This coming from the guy who hasn't
asked anyone out since middle school.

356
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,436
You guys have been together forever.

357
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,948
Your whole lives are planned out.
Next year...

358
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,310
Dude, I just don't understand how your
sister convinced you to ask someone.

359
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,079
You've been ignoring my advice
for years. Right, Mei?

360
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,510
Lloyd, she's out there.
Now go find her.

361
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,152
So do you think
you're gonna go to prom?

362
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,394
I don't know yet. It depends.

363
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,632
Do you know what? I really wanna go.
Only if he asks me, like...

364
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,434
Alice, you know he's gonna
ask you. So, it'll be OK.

365
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,555
- What is that?
- Oh, my God.

366
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,554
Who did this?

367
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,637
- I don't know.
- I mean,

368
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,990
what kind of sick twist would put creepy
serial killer letters

369
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,519
on a person's locker?

370
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,068
- It's OK.
- Oh, God!

371
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,190
What did I do wrong?

372
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,030
- So?
- I was never here. You never saw me.

373
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,955
Lloyd?

374
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,112
Come on, guys. Work it.

375
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,274
Well, now you
have to ask her out.

376
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,118
- I don't know, dude.
- You're killing me here, man.

377
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,995
There you go, fellas.

378
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,917
We totally had that.

379
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,554
Hey, Lucas.
You're looking good out there, bro.

380
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,953
- Really?
- He is?

381
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,319
You've got real varsity potential.

382
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,590
He does?

383
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,714
I gotta go.

384
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,671
Wow. Thanks, Tyler.

385
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,632
Hey, I'm having a team barbecue
on Thursday. You should swing by.

386
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,159
- Really?
- Yeah. Totally casual.

387
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,110
Bring a friend if you want.

388
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,354
Corey?

389
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,270
I was thinking more
like a girl, Lucas.

390
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,639
Oh. Right.

391
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,079
You know some of those,
don't you?

392
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,395
Yeah. Of course. Tons.

393
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,670
All right. See you there, bro.

394
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,959
Here you go.

395
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,832
Just some dumb prom decorations and
you're going to help her rebuild them.

396
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,998
Yeah. Sure he is. If he
ever bothered to show up.

397
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,673
Glad you could make it.

398
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,711
No place I'd rather be.

399
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,712
Great. You know what?

400
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,911
Why don't you move
that stuff from there...

401
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,434
...to over there.

402
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,717
Do you think
you can handle that?

403
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,712
Ow.

404
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,478
Problem?

405
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,755
No. I was just taking
inventory of this...

406
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,595
...bucket.
- That would be one.

407
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,998
You want some help with that?

408
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,152
Yeah. Sure.

409
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,315
Why don't you give it a long,

410
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,272
brooding stare until it carries
itself across the room.

411
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,072
Wait. Nova, hold on a second.

412
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,951
I just wanna say one thing.

413
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,273
Lift from the legs.

414
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,793
He's a menace.
A rude, arrogant menace

415
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,637
who'd rather look down
on everyone else

416
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,592
than make any effort
of his own. And he was late.

417
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,870
I don't know if Dunnan is doing
this to punish him or me.

418
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,909
What's his name again?

419
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,916
- Is that Jesse Richter?
- Yeah.

420
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,599
That that punk that stocks
shelves down at the market?

421
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,789
I think he works there.

422
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,115
Well. Well, I used to
run with his dad, OK?

423
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,718
Apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

424
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,796
Is there any chance Jesse
might actually help you?

425
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,195
Kitty, he's a punk, all right?

426
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,754
He's not gonna all of a sudden
turn into an upright citizen.

427
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,789
I didn't say that.

428
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,671
I'm just saying it seems like you could
use some help, Nova.

429
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,756
Three weeks isn't a lot of time.

430
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,916
Yeah, help, sure. But he's a...

431
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,758
- He's a walking misdemeanour.
- Thank you, Dad.

432
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,158
"I'm a tough guy.

433
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,556
I have long hair
and drive a motorcycle.

434
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,955
I can lift heavy things."

435
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,228
Whoop-iddy-doo.

436
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,598
Be right back.

437
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,553
You should see this guy, Dad.

438
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,909
It's like he enjoys watching me suffer.

439
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,793
This kid gives you any more trouble,
you just come to me, OK?

440
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,308
- Nova, it's Brandon.
- Hey, Mrs Prescott.

441
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,079
Brandon. Hey, invite him in.
I'II... I'll set another place.

442
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,314
Yeah.

443
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,878
- Brandon, what are you doing...
- I got into Princeton!

444
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,798
- Wow! Congratulations.
- Yeah!

445
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,910
Thank you. That's not all.

446
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,757
I'm a finalist
for the dean's scholarship.

447
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,711
That's amazing.

448
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,399
The interview for the scholarship,

449
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,228
it's the same weekend as prom.

450
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,678
- Oh.
- I hate to leave you hanging.

451
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,192
No. I, I...
I totally get it.

452
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,438
There's still some time for you
to find another date, right?

453
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,472
Yeah. Totally. I'll be fine.

454
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,273
- Fine.
- All right. Cool.

455
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,589
Cool.

456
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,512
I just can't believe
he would do this to you.

457
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,028
- I mean, two weeks before.
- Yeah. He's a jerk.

458
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,433
- A loser.
- I hate him.

459
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,391
- I've always hated him.
- He's an idiot.

460
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,829
Guys, it's not that
big of a deal. Honest.

461
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,839
Besides, prom's not even close to being
ready. I still have a ton to do.

462
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,791
But who are you gonna go with?

463
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,154
Well, lots of people
go to prom without dates.

464
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,236
No. You don't have
to do all this, Nova.

465
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,555
- Yeah.
- Just because Brandon bailed on me

466
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,636
doesn't mean I'm gonna bail
on the senior class.

467
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,432
I'm fine. Now go.

468
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,039
Go.

469
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,469
Hey.

470
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,269
Wait.

471
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,836
It's a varsity party
and Tyler invited me.

472
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,869
- No way.
- No, really.

473
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,433
And he told me to bring a girl.

474
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,232
Wow. Tyler Barso's barbecue.

475
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,158
That's almost a "triumphant
Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock" moment.

476
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,668
- Really?
- Well...

477
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,837
No. That could be your
Hendrix moment.

478
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,472
- Hi.
- Hey, Simone.

479
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,397
But first, fly check.

480
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,876
Pit check. OK.
Now breathe on me.

481
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,717
- Wait, why?
- You wanna ask her out with butt mouth?

482
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,591
I don't think so. Come on. Hit me.

483
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,757
I didn't get anything. Hit me again.

484
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,279
- Dude.
- I just had a cough drop, all right?

485
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,709
My olfactory nerves are compromised.
Come on.

486
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,229
What are you guys doing?

487
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,713
- Extra credit!
- Yeah. Yeah.

488
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,673
- I gotta go.
- He's... weird.

489
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,039
Yeah.

490
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,835
So, I'm glad
you're here today.

491
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,792
I mean, I knew you'd be here.
This is our class.

492
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,035
Not that you never miss class
or anything.

493
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,435
I mean, you don't miss a lot of class.

494
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,233
You have excellent attendance
as far as I can tell.

495
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,675
I try.

496
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,230
There's a lacrosse team barbecue
on Thursday

497
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,554
and I was wondering
if you wanted to go with me.

498
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,388
I mean, unless you have a lacrosse
issue, which some people do, sometimes.

499
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,112
- That sounds like fun.
- Really?

500
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,718
Yeah. I love barbecues.

501
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,512
She loves barbecues.

502
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,358
Cool.

503
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,990
We start every day at three.

504
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,270
Dude, relax. It's 3.15.

505
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,549
I'm not a dude,
and I know what time it is. You're late.

506
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,272
All right, dude.

507
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,753
What's this supposed to be?

508
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,318
It's a celestial fountain.

509
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,750
Well, it's gonna leak
all over the "celestial" floor

510
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,756
unless you purge the line
and unclog the intake.

511
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,799
I know that.

512
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,554
- Hey, Rolo.
- Hey.

513
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,717
Can I see Athena's profile?

514
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,512
No. She doesn't have one.

515
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,994
Really? No profile?

516
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:56,953
Actually, she had to take her page down
'cause she got grounded.

517
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,833
What's she in for?

518
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,871
She was out clubbin' till late.

519
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,199
So Athena likes to get
up in the club, huh?

520
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,233
Yeah. Big time.

521
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,670
Sweet!

522
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,077
Come on. Come on.

523
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,315
No! No, no, no, no, no!
Stop, sir!

524
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,759
Stop, truck!

525
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:52,157
No, no! Jen.

526
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,189
Jen, you missed it!
There was a sign!

527
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,510
No! No!

528
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,070
OK. Come on, baby.

529
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,431
Stop, stop, stop! Stop!

530
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,119
And... it's leaking.

531
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,509
Yes, it is. Happy?

532
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,959
Amused.

533
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,672
You act all tough,
but I know you.

534
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,508
You're the guy who cried when the class
hamster died in third grade.

535
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,597
Yeah, well, Heady didn't
make me build a cosmic canopy.

536
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,512
You remember her name?

537
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,028
You just need a hamster
to love, don't you?

538
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,438
This is a disaster.

539
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,109
A hurricane's a disaster.
Smallpox. Locusts.

540
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,550
Those are disasters.
This is just a fountain.

541
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,999
And it's just prom.

542
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,268
Just prom?

543
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,630
Yeah. Lame DJ, balloons,
poofy dresses.

544
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,829
Not something to get
so worked up about.

545
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,757
I forgot. School functions

546
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,031
conflict with your "thinking that I'm
better than everyone" time.

547
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,072
Well, for the rest of us,
prom happens to be fun.

548
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,669
Not for the guys. You gotta buy dinner.
You gotta get the little flower thing.

549
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,517
Don't pretend
you don't know what it's called.

550
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,790
And then there's the tuxedo,
the ultimate symbol of conformity

551
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,398
that a bunch of other guys
have already sweated in.

552
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,318
Whereas you opt
for the long hair and black jacket.

553
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:20,114
The whole "motorcycle" thing.
The ultimate symbol of nonconformity.

554
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,628
At least I don't wear it posing
in front of some stupid backdrop.

555
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,399
- People keep those pictures forever.
- In a box in their attic.

556
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,238
A lot of people worked
really hard on prom.

557
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,713
And it all burned down.

558
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,798
Look, I'm sorry.

559
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,400
Prom is obviously really
important to you.

560
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,159
I just don't get it.

561
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,918
All this for one night.

562
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,035
Yeah, you're right.

563
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,791
But... it's the last night,

564
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,154
and it's the last dance.

565
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,079
And for that one night, who we were
for four years of high school...

566
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,951
...it doesn't matter.

567
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,630
It's just all of us together
in this one perfect moment.

568
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,117
And I wanna be a part of that.

569
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,200
- It should be this next block.
- Thanks for driving, Corey.

570
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,119
Yeah, sure thing.
I'm a driver. I can drive.

571
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,674
As long as it's during daylight hours
and with adult supervision.

572
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,550
Now, slow down.

573
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,160
What is that sound? I could swear
it's my mom nagging me, but no,

574
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,431
that's impossible since she promised
to be quiet during this car ride.

575
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,516
- Use your signal.
- Mom.

576
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,038
- Aren't you coming, Corey?
- Right.

577
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,832
- Only Lucas was invited.
- Silence.

578
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,836
But it's a team barbecue.

579
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,952
Yeah, it is, but it's... varsity.

580
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,831
Everybody's in the back. Go ahead.

581
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,996
- Hey, Tyler, what's up, man?
- My man, what's up

582
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,555
Oh. That explains it.

583
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,955
You kids have fun... without me.

584
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,672
If you guys need a ride before sundown,

585
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,280
you know,
just give me a call. I'll be here.

586
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,359
Hello, hello. What's up?
Lucas, you made it.

587
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,914
What's up, man? This is Simone.

588
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,075
We've met.

589
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,232
Really?

590
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,312
Doesn't everyone know Tyler Barso?

591
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,873
Hey, you know what?

592
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,194
Come inside.
Let me show you guys around.

593
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,793
Come on.

594
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,910
- Hey, my man.
- Hey, what's up?

595
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,919
- Hey, Tyler, what's up?
- Sean!

596
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,679
- Tyler!
- What's up, buddy?

597
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,393
I'll be right back, OK?

598
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:57,594
Hey, ladies. This is, this
is Lucas, and he's on the team.

599
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,073
Oh, yeah? What position are you?

600
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,712
Seated, usually.

601
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,475
You're funny.

602
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,315
- Hey.
- Don't talk to me.

603
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,271
Come on.
Don't play it like that.

604
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,719
I'm glad you're here. I miss you.

605
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,318
I had no idea this was your party.

606
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,429
Are you sure about that?

607
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,436
There wasn't
a teeny, tiny part of you

608
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,879
that wanted to see me, too?

609
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,395
How many more twinkly
lights do we really need?

610
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,555
A lot.

611
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,393
You collect these things?

612
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,429
Kind of.

613
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,072
Whenever I have an event:

614
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,556
college tour, scholarship
dinner, awards banquet,

615
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,716
I always just stick 'em there.

616
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,955
I know, it's kinda dorky.

617
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,994
No. It's impressive.

618
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:21,194
- No. Not this song.
- You hate this song, too?

619
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,708
There's like eight words in it
and two of them are "party."

620
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,035
If this were my world,

621
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,117
Corey and I would have veto power for
all music released into the airwaves.

622
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,077
Really? Just you guys?

623
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,076
Well, you too, if you wanted.

624
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,718
Yeah, thanks.

625
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:43,429
So, do you just talk the talk
or can you walk the walk?

626
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,710
Do I play?

627
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,192
No. I don't.

628
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,753
You wanna learn?

629
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,029
Here.

630
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,158
Put your hand like this.

631
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,835
No. OK.

632
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,390
That's a "C."

633
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,793
C.

634
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,678
Yes, but you have to strum.

635
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,918
OK, wait, wait.

636
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,878
OK, try now.

637
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,677
There you go. You'll be
a rock god in no time.

638
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,994
Do you have a boyfriend?

639
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,989
I'm sorry.

640
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,792
I mean, it's none of my business.

641
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,115
C, C, C, C.

642
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,311
No, it's OK.

643
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,716
There was one guy.

644
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,354
But it turns out
he's not exactly available.

645
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,429
Sorry.

646
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,399
It's fine. I'm over it.

647
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,029
It's perfect! She doesn't
have a boyfriend, she told me.

648
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,672
- And she plays guitar.
- Lucas.

649
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,119
I mean, it's just
like you said, right?

650
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,310
- You never listen to what I say.
- She's into me.

651
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,952
Which is why I'm gonna ask her
to study as soon as I see...

652
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,955
Hey.

653
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,639
- Did you forget what day it is?
- Friday?

654
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,389
Yes, which we've established and
designated as "Stick Hippo T-shirt day."

655
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:18,995
Where's yours?

656
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,871
I guess I forgot.

657
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,075
All right. Well, I have an extra,
you know, for emergencies...

658
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,431
Tyler! Great party, bro!

659
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,708
Hey, you the man, Luke!

660
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,756
"Luke"?

661
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,715
Mei? You have a very important
decision to make.

662
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,637
What?

663
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:54,276
And I want you to know that
whatever you decide, I support.

664
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,072
What are you talking about?

665
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,237
The limo. Both Mark
and Izzy want white,

666
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,512
but I said I thought you and I were more
the classic black types.

667
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,515
- Aren't we?
- I guess...

668
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,437
What's wrong?

669
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:16,390
It's just...
Do I get any say in this?

670
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,395
Yeah, yeah, of course you do.

671
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,158
How many other things
have you figured out?

672
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,316
I mean, who says
I even wanted a limo?

673
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,035
All right. Look, we don't have
to decide this right now.

674
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,238
Forget I said anything.

675
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,351
Go for it!

676
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,755
OK, what do I say?

677
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,439
Just pretend you're a normal person.

678
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,389
OK.

679
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,553
Hi, Kristen! It's Lloyd.

680
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,113
I'm in your Civics class.

681
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,152
- Really?
- You lent me a pencil.

682
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,952
I was like,
"Do you have a pencil?"

683
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,514
And you were like, "Yes."
So, I brought it back...

684
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:09,269
Here... it is. But wait,
that's not the point.

685
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,630
This might seem out of the
blue, this is out of the blue,

686
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:17,879
actually, but, prom is coming up, as you
know, and I am looking for a date,

687
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,673
and I was wondering if maybe
you wanted to go with me.

688
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,195
Are you serious?

689
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,559
Well, I know it's
a little last minute,

690
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,352
but I'm really fun, I swear.

691
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,709
- You know, I have references...
- No, it's not that.

692
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,718
I have a boyfriend.
Didn't you know that?

693
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,513
Oh. No, I guess not.

694
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,630
I thought everyone
knew about us.

695
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,037
I'm Kristen, he's Anton.
We're Kranton.

696
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,438
I mean, how could you
not know about us?

697
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,199
- You'd have to live in a cave.
- I don't.

698
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,313
Yeah, I mean, we're always together
and the five minutes I'm talking to you

699
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,157
have been the longest
we've been apart in months.

700
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,078
- Huh.
- Yeah. You're back.

701
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,269
God, I missed you.

702
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,633
Anton.

703
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,992
OK, I'll just... slip it in.

704
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,712
Just slip it in there.

705
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,479
Just... Right in front of me. OK.

706
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,114
Well, talk to ya later then,
"Kranton."

707
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,479
...and she called him.

708
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,353
- Hey, Simone.
- Hey.

709
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,789
Listen, if you wanna study
for the elements test after school...

710
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,717
I'd love to. I really need it.

711
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,318
Cool. How about
we meet in the library?

712
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,669
Perfect. I'll be there.

713
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,792
Hey, I thought
we were gonna study.

714
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,638
Dude, I'm sealing the deal.

715
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,673
OK, yeah. I'll just study by myself.
That's much more efficient.

716
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,994
Cool.

717
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,238
You must've worked all night.

718
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,636
It's...

719
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,152
...inspired.

720
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,909
I have a kid brother. He's seven.

721
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,838
And because of my mom's work schedule,
I have to pick him up from school.

722
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,996
Why are you telling me this?

723
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,555
It's why I cut class
and I'm late getting here.

724
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,393
I just want you to know, I'm not blowing
it off 'cause I'm a slacker.

725
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,229
From now on...

726
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,278
...we start at 3.15.

727
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,997
Hi, Simone.
Welcome to the library.

728
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,956
Hey, Simone, you ready to study?

729
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,792
Hey, Simone, didn't see you there.

730
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,990
What am I saying?
Of course I saw her.

731
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,353
Hey.

732
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,913
What do you want?

733
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,393
Can I give you a ride home?

734
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,078
I have plans.

735
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,235
Listen, I really
need to talk, Simone.

736
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,238
All right, there aren't a lot
of people I can do that with.

737
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,032
Just a few minutes?

738
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,029
- Why won't you answer my texts?
- You know why.

739
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,116
I mean, you said it was over
between you and Jordan.

740
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,673
I never would've gone out with you.

741
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,439
Please don't ice me out
like this, Simone.

742
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:17,029
I know it's messed up about Jordan,
but we've been together for a long time.

743
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,514
OK, she's been talking
about prom for years.

744
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,552
- But, Tyler, this isn't...
- You're such a special girl.

745
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:26,918
If you weren't, I would
never expect you to understand.

746
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,554
Just give me until after prom.

747
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,714
You're missing my...

748
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,596
Unbelievable.

749
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,589
What?

750
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,791
Archfield's prom is this weekend,
and Ali just found out that their theme

751
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:42,550
- is "Starry, Starry Night."
- They have an extra "Starry."

752
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,637
- So?
- It's gonna sound really stupid.

753
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,558
I just thought that we were
creating this one-of-a-kind night,

754
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:55,070
and turns out there's another
one a couple miles away.

755
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,715
Just makes it feel so... ordinary.

756
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,833
Well, maybe we should check out
how starry their night really is.

757
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:14,232
You can do it, Nova.

758
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,838
Do what?

759
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,791
Trust me.

760
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,833
Great.

761
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,029
So, how are you
gonna get us in there?

762
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,231
I'm gonna fire my grappling
hook gun, climb onto the roof,

763
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,475
and crash in through the skylight.

764
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,397
Really?

765
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,591
No.

766
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:18,549
Good thinking.

767
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,991
Oh, man. This is pathetic.

768
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,873
These totally come in a kit.

769
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,713
That's lame.
And a balloon wall, really?

770
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,554
These lights don't even twinkle.

771
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,909
And where's the cosmic canopy?

772
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,428
Complete amateurs.

773
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,356
Why are you doing this?

774
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,073
Well, I hadn't broken in
anywhere in a while, and I thought...

775
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,872
I'm serious.

776
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:06,754
You don't care about prom.
So... why help me?

777
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,956
It's nice to be around someone
who believes in something so much.

778
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,589
What are you doing?

779
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:26,595
What do you mean?

780
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,834
You were gonna kiss me.

781
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,677
- No, I wasn't.
- Well, why not?

782
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:30,914
What?

783
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:37,071
Nova. If I'm about to kiss you,
you'll know it.

784
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,669
What was that?

785
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,199
Hey! Who's there?

786
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,037
We gotta go.

787
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,599
Nova, this way.

788
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,318
- Black and white?
- Come on!

789
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,748
We did it!

790
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,351
I have a record now.

791
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,119
A rap sheet. I have "priors".

792
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,151
You don't have "priors".

793
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,156
A stern warning
and a call to your parents

794
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,713
isn't exactly your "first strike".

795
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,671
What if they tell Georgetown?

796
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,517
Nova, it's fine. They're not...

797
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,357
- You! Hey, you!
- Dad...

798
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,231
- What'd you do to her?
- It's OK.

799
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,589
- OK? What are you, out of your mind?
- He was doing all this for me.

800
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,232
What? Breaking into a school?
Getting stopped by the cops?

801
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,430
Please listen to me.
I deserve the blame, OK?

802
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,674
Really? Whose idea was it?

803
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,712
- Dad, Archfield had the same exact...
- You're right. It was my idea.

804
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,758
This isn't you, Nova. Let's go.

805
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,317
Kid's a loser.

806
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:31,749
Hi.

807
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,993
Hey.

808
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,234
- Tyler.
- Hey, babe.

809
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,159
It's over.
I know about your sophomore.

810
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,272
I'm really sorry I didn't
make it to the library.

811
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,035
The library! I totally forgot.

812
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:51,071
Really?

813
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:55,511
- I gave a girl a ride home.
- This isn't about her. It's about you.

814
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:59,314
I was out with the team. Tyler wanted to
show me some moves. Varsity stuff.

815
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,555
I'm looking good
for next year, so...

816
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,431
Tyler showed you.

817
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,916
Yeah. We must've lost track of time
and forgot about our plans.

818
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,794
- What are you so upset about?
- I'm not upset. I'm done.

819
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,315
Well, I'm still really sorry.

820
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,828
I would've hated waiting all afternoon
for someone to show up.

821
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,395
Yeah. That would've sucked.

822
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,550
Prom's right around the corner.
What are you gonna do, not go?

823
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,716
Don't worry about me, Tyler.

824
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,309
You just keep worrying about you,
since that's what you're best at.

825
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,911
Out of the whole collection,
these two are my favourites.

826
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,594
This Harvey Kuenn's worth,
like, 40 bucks,

827
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,916
and this Al Kaline
would go for 80 at least.

828
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,996
You must have some allowance, kid.

829
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,235
My dad left them behind.

830
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,111
Charlie. Why are you
carrying those around?

831
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:09,828
They stay in the basement.

832
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,588
What are you doing here?

833
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:19,794
The way my dad talked to you,
you didn't deserve that.

834
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,229
And the way Dunnan treats you...

835
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:25,477
A lot of people are wrong about you.

836
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,428
And... I was one of 'em.

837
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,351
You came all the way here
to tell me that?

838
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:38,073
I even ditched last period.

839
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,271
For her, that's a big deal.

840
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,359
What are you,
his peer counsellor or something?

841
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,279
Hey! Talking about? Peer counsellor!

842
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,348
Can I at least
just see it on you?

843
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,550
No! I look like a manatee.

844
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,079
No one will ever
see this dress on me.

845
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,634
Cut is wrong, the colour is
wrong, the fabric is wrong.

846
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,874
Everything is wrong!

847
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,195
No, don't! Mei...
Now what are you gonna wear?

848
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,879
I don't know! Nothing.

849
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,509
What is this about?

850
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,518
I know you.
It's not about a dress.

851
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,035
Look, if you don't want to go to
prom, just let me know.

852
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,673
What are you talking about?

853
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,551
Well, first it was the limo.
Now the dress.

854
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:26,956
You're obviously looking
for excuses not to go.

855
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,718
- I never said that.
- You don't have to.

856
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,910
I know when I'm being blown off.

857
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,714
You don't wanna go? Fine.

858
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,479
Prom's off. Problem solved.

859
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,431
Good bye, Tyler.

860
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,476
Hey, Jordan,
I was thinking. Are you?

861
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,309
Whoa.

862
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,991
I like it better that way.

863
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,879
Me, too.

864
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,159
- There you go.
- Thank you.

865
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,919
So, you say you two have been
working together at school?

866
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,636
Something like that.

867
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:49,510
Can I get a refill
before I barf, please?

868
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,997
My favourite kind of customers.

869
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,349
Waitress! Cleanup on aisle five.

870
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,992
You gonna clean that up?

871
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,272
- I think we should go.
- Are you gonna clean that up?

872
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:08,834
- Do you hear something?
- Nah, I don't see anything either.

873
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,433
I want you to come with me.

874
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:18,356
Jesse... You can do it.

875
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,995
- Do what?
- Trust me.

876
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,150
Those idiots aren't worth it. Come on.

877
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,395
They'll get what's coming
to 'em. Stuff balances out.

878
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,398
- Wake up, Nova.
- What does that mean?

879
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:41,668
It means it's easy
to believe in that stuff

880
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,119
when everything
always goes your way.

881
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:46,152
You think that
everything goes my way?

882
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,954
That I have no problems
in my life because my dad didn't leave?

883
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,639
You think sometimes I don't
wanna just forget everything,

884
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,511
get on my motorcycle all angry

885
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:56,949
and misunderstood
and go beat some people up?

886
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,312
I have to work my butt off
just to try to get things to go my way.

887
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,795
Everybody does.

888
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:11,395
What?

889
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,749
I bet you could
beat some people up.

890
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,193
Yeah, I could.

891
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:20,631
OK. Let's go dress shopping.

892
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:23,429
What?

893
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:38,755
So, how come you don't
have a date?

894
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,030
He bailed on me.

895
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:45,716
Well, there must be somebody
else you could go with.

896
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,990
Like the class president
or something?

897
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:51,434
I am the class president.

898
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:55,632
Come on. There must be some honour
student out there who you could go...

899
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,277
Really?

900
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:15,471
That looks fantastic with
our garnet pendant necklace.

901
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,159
Necklace?
With the price of this dress,

902
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,510
the only necklace I'll be able to
afford'll be made out of candy.

903
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,314
That guy who ditched you
made a big mistake.

904
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:52,078
This is awful. You've been dissed,
trampled, humiliated, stomped on.

905
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,156
Your heart's just been, like,
torn out and ground up in...

906
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,679
I get it! OK?

907
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,878
What's that?

908
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:04,838
Hey, Simone. You didn't happen to see
anybody put this in my locker, did you?

909
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,155
Why? What is it?

910
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:11,318
Tickets.
To see Mechanical Sandwich?

911
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,112
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They had an interesting single,

912
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:15,037
but then they changed bass
players on the second album

913
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,513
and totally ended up sucking.

914
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,471
Yeah. Their second album
was pretty lame.

915
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,272
I don't even know why
Stick Hippo's opening for them.

916
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,355
- What?!
- What?!

917
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,913
Hold on. How do you
know about this? I mean,

918
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:26,032
I'm a certified Stick Hippo webmaster,
and even I didn't know about this.

919
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:27,513
Well, it's kind of a secret gig.

920
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:30,757
I got the last two tickets.
Oh, I like your site, by the way.

921
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:35,555
You're the one hit.
Dude, she's the one hit!

922
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:39,309
Wait. That means
my mom's been lying to me.

923
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,556
- I bet they're great live.
- Are you kidding? They're the best!

924
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:47,160
Where are our seats?

925
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:55,798
This is like
a "you guys" thing. OK.

926
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,478
Just get me a T-shirt
or something.

927
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,078
Definitely.

928
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:06,755
Do all assigned books have
to be so torturously boring?

929
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:11,114
Oh, yeah. This is rough.
<i>Ethan Frome?</i>

930
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:14,311
The worst! The guy falls in love
with his wife's cousin,

931
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:17,591
goes sledding with her,
she winds up paralysed. Snore.

932
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,716
That is an incredibly
accurate plot summary.

933
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:30,037
Hey, listen. You don't happen
to have a date to prom, do you?

934
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,433
- Me?
- Yeah.

935
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:33,675
I mean, I know it's
a crazy thing to just ask...

936
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:38,077
No. It's sweet. I don't think we've ever
talked before, have we?

937
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,315
Maybe not. I'm Lloyd.

938
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:42,669
- Betsy.
- Short for Elizabeth?

939
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:45,314
- That's right.
- Pretty.

940
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,191
Thanks.

941
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,314
So, what do you say, Bets? Prom?

942
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,912
Well, it could be fun. You seem nice.

943
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,758
But I have a date already.

944
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:02,590
I mean, we're just friends, we're going
as friends, but, prom's Saturday.

945
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,278
I can't cancel now.

946
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:07,198
Yeah, no, I underst... Yeah.

947
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:11,074
It's too bad. If only we'd
met sooner, you know?

948
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,429
Yeah.

949
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,358
Isn't it funny how you can go to school
with somebody for so long

950
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,994
and not even meet them till now?

951
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:22,998
Yeah. Funny.

952
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,800
Like sledding
and getting paralysed.

953
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:15,509
What are you doing?

954
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:18,393
Can't a guy ask a girl to prom?

955
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:20,556
I thought you
were taking Jordan.

956
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,113
It's over.

957
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,596
I ended it for real.

958
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,315
Tyler...

959
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:29,509
I mean, if you want to think
about it,

960
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,994
you can just bring
your answer to school tomorrow.

961
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:35,869
And...

962
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:40,992
I got this for you, too.

963
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:47,516
I'd love to hear
you play sometime.

964
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,720
Rolo. Wow.

965
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,591
That's a good look for you.

966
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,074
How do I know which one to pick?

967
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:17,509
Well, do you know
what Athena's wearing?

968
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:19,471
Yeah. This.

969
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:23,599
Nice try.

970
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:25,073
What do you mean?

971
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:28,032
You'd have to be a Victoria's Secret
model to pull this off.

972
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,071
Well, that's what she's wearing.

973
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:32,076
What magazine did you
rip this out of?

974
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,394
Oh, no, no, no.
She sent it to me.

975
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:34,919
In the mail, of course.

976
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,758
Because her e-mail privileges,
they were revoked when

977
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,756
- she stayed out clubbing.
- Clubbing.

978
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,077
Exactly.

979
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:47,591
All right, Rolo.
I guess I'll see you guys at prom.

980
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:48,914
Cool.

981
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:53,313
Wonder if they'll be too high?

982
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:57,672
- I don't want to be taller than him.
- Taller than who?

983
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,870
You got a prom date, and this is the
first we're hearing about it?

984
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:02,912
He hasn't asked me yet, but...

985
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:06,919
...tomorrow's our last day working
together, and I think he's going to.

986
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:09,758
Is she talking about Jesse Richter?
Are you talking about Jesse Richter?

987
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,514
Wow! Nova likes bad boys.

988
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:15,835
- Who knew?
- You rebel!

989
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:18,917
It's more than that.
I've never felt like this before.

990
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:23,194
You and Jesse Richter.
I don't believe it.

991
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:25,800
- Yeah, no one will.
- Why not?

992
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,074
Because you're you, and he's...

993
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:30,111
And he's not exactly Brandon.

994
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,593
He's kind of on the other side
of the planet from Brandon.

995
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:32,311
Yeah.

996
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:36,353
Well, maybe that stuff isn't
as important as I thought it was.

997
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,552
Maybe there's more to a person than
being valedictorian or class president.

998
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,113
So sweet!

999
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,718
- Hey.
- Hey.

1000
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:08,750
Hey, Jesse.

1001
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,989
- Hey.
- I'm here about Nova.

1002
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:17,190
Is she all right?

1003
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:18,309
Yeah, she's fine.

1004
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:21,875
In fact, she's,
she's better than fine.

1005
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:25,515
Top of her class,
full scholarship next year.

1006
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:27,999
Big plans.

1007
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,115
I know.

1008
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:33,152
OK. You know.

1009
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:37,159
But maybe you don't know how much work
she's done to get where she is.

1010
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,236
She's in the home stretch now.

1011
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:42,078
And that's where you came in.

1012
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,554
Right at the end.

1013
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,352
You don't even know me.

1014
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,355
No, I... I do know you.

1015
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:53,039
Come on. I was just like you.

1016
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:55,469
Struggling to get by,
angry at the world.

1017
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,830
You know, no plans for the future.

1018
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,110
And you might even figure it out.

1019
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:06,349
But it's not fair to drag
Nova down while you do.

1020
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:13,279
So, if you care about her
as much as I think you do...

1021
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,520
...you won't be the thing
that holds her back.

1022
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:39,550
OK, so the President of
the United States comes to you,

1023
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:43,149
says that we need a new national anthem,
any band, any era, right?

1024
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,873
There's, there's Simone.
I'll catch you later.

1025
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,876
- Hey, Simone.
- All right.

1026
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,990
Hey, Lucas.

1027
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:54,759
So, on Saturday, what do
you think? Pick you up at six?

1028
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,792
Actually, I've been looking for you.

1029
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:01,276
Because Saturday's prom,

1030
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:04,039
and do you remember
that guy I told you about

1031
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:07,516
who wasn't available?
Well, he asked me.

1032
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:09,676
And we're going.

1033
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:15,270
I didn't mean to mess up your
plans. It all happened so fast.

1034
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:18,710
No. I'm happy for you.

1035
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:24,397
I'm really sorry, Lucas.

1036
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:28,316
- Let's go. I'm starving. Huh?
- Go.

1037
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:29,952
You guys are going for pizza?

1038
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,514
You're the man, Luke!

1039
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:57,634
Hey.

1040
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,352
Hey.

1041
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:02,278
So, I was thinking we should check
the speed of the disco ball,

1042
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,595
make sure it's not too fast or...

1043
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:07,557
OK. Great.

1044
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,714
That looks good. Right?

1045
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:20,433
Or is that too slow?
Is it too slow?

1046
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:21,674
Nova, just tell me how you want it.

1047
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:23,278
Well, don't you have an opinion?

1048
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,788
My opinion is I wanna set this
thing and be done with it.

1049
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,992
That's fine, then.

1050
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:33,793
I can't wait until
you turn on that fountain

1051
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,671
under these lights tomorrow night.

1052
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:38,553
- Me?
- Well, who else?

1053
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,079
I won't be here.

1054
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,800
You didn't think I was actually gonna go
to this thing, did you?

1055
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:48,949
Yeah.

1056
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,231
I've wasted enough of my time on prom.

1057
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:56,956
I don't think it was
a waste of time... for us.

1058
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,672
What "us"?

1059
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:03,277
You expect me to believe that this
hasn't meant anything to you?

1060
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,675
That you don't feel any different?

1061
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:08,280
How I feel or how you feel
doesn't mean anything.

1062
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,674
What?

1063
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,995
Your world may be all disco
balls and celestial fountains,

1064
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:15,519
but that's not where I live.

1065
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:18,313
Where I live, I'm a bad guy
who's going nowhere,

1066
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:19,679
and that's the only reason I'm here.

1067
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,836
None of that stuff matters.

1068
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,633
As long as you feel
the same way about me as...

1069
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:29,038
...I feel about you.

1070
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:33,953
I don't.

1071
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:10,556
OK. So, just to be clear,
that is a "no."

1072
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,238
- Yeah.
- OK.

1073
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:15,072
I know the feeling.

1074
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:19,151
What's her name?

1075
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,277
Simone.

1076
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:26,239
Simone.

1077
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:32,551
I didn't ask her. What happened?

1078
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:36,599
She's going to prom.

1079
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,473
Shoulda known. Prom.

1080
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,511
That soul-crushing mistress.

1081
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:47,152
Yeah, well, she's going and now
she'll never know how I feel.

1082
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:51,919
You gotta tell her.

1083
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,233
- You don't even know me.
- Don't I?

1084
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:01,831
Shy, nice guy, always waiting for the
right time to make his move,

1085
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:04,030
and the right time never comes?

1086
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,593
Before you know it, you're a senior,

1087
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:09,792
couple weeks from graduating,
and... you saw.

1088
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:13,589
You can't keep waiting
for the right moment to happen.

1089
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:17,349
Make it happen.
What do you have to lose?

1090
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:38,513
- Hey.
- Hey.

1091
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,790
I have to tell you something.

1092
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:57,596
I got accepted to Parsons.

1093
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,711
For design.

1094
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:02,595
In New York.

1095
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:07,793
New York.

1096
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,431
I didn't even know you applied.

1097
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:15,119
I didn't think I'd get in.

1098
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:18,232
And I was wait-listed
and I thought "no way."

1099
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,672
And then I got in.

1100
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:29,069
Justin... I'm gonna go.

1101
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,159
Say something.

1102
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,268
How could you think
I wouldn't be proud of you?

1103
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:49,749
This is why you've been acting
so crazy about prom.

1104
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:56,789
Prom is supposed to
be this "forever" night.

1105
01:15:56,840 --> 01:16:02,073
And we're supposed to be
this..."forever" couple.

1106
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:06,832
Yeah.

1107
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:16,799
You know,
nobody knows the future.

1108
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:22,514
But I do know
how I feel about you.

1109
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:29,197
And what if
that's not enough?

1110
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:33,552
Mei, look at me. It's enough.

1111
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:46,074
- Do you think...
- What?

1112
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:50,997
Anyone would notice if I wore
my homecoming dress?

1113
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:54,872
Who cares?

1114
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:26,155
Dude, get off me! Shut up. Idiot.

1115
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,156
Hey. See me now?

1116
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:36,990
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Get outta here! Stop it!

1117
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,190
- Break it up!
- Get off of him!

1118
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:40,476
Move it!

1119
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:45,433
Let me see you. You OK?
Are you all right?

1120
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:47,232
God, look at you.

1121
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:49,236
Look at you.

1122
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:52,317
Come on. Come get inside.

1123
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,638
OK, ready? OK.

1124
01:19:40,680 --> 01:19:43,513
Do we really have to do the whole
picture-by-the-fireplace thing?

1125
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:44,675
Come on.
It's gonna be great.

1126
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,597
Why?

1127
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:51,509
Because the balloons are right
and the tablecloths match the napkins?

1128
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:54,836
Lots of people go to prom
without dates.

1129
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:58,951
This is about someone
in particular, isn't it?

1130
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:06,236
I know it didn't make sense.
It just...

1131
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:11,234
...it just felt right.

1132
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:13,837
Why can't I have that?

1133
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,199
What did I do wrong?

1134
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,912
I had a talk with him.

1135
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,830
You did what?

1136
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:31,319
I was protecting what we always
talked about for you.

1137
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:34,955
You've worked so hard.
I didn't want him to...

1138
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,992
...ruin all the great things
you had ahead of you.

1139
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:44,354
I know you think you were doing
what's best for me...

1140
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:48,678
...but tonight could've been
one of those great things.

1141
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:54,553
And he's not the one who ruined it.

1142
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,234
Sorry.

1143
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:23,998
What are you doing?

1144
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:25,758
I meant to hit the window.

1145
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,791
Why are you in the tree?

1146
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,956
I have to tell you something.

1147
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,912
- Lucas, my date's gonna be...
- Don't go to prom.

1148
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:36,317
You're not seriously
asking me that.

1149
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:38,878
I love you...

1150
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:41,671
...as more than a friend.

1151
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,951
Love implies more than a friend.

1152
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,993
Yes. It does, and I've missed every
chance to tell you until now

1153
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:51,395
because I was stupid and scared.

1154
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:54,431
But now I'm in this tree,

1155
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,436
and you're so beautiful.

1156
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:01,398
And if you walk out that door,
I might as well stay up here forever.

1157
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,558
Don't go.

1158
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:21,158
Tyler? You're going to prom with Tyler?

1159
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:24,112
I didn't know how to tell you.

1160
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:32,516
I'm sorry, Lucas. I have to go.

1161
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:19,911
Yo, Tyler! How's it goin', man?

1162
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:21,632
What's up, baby?

1163
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:25,309
Chillin'. Chillin'.
Lookin' fresh, lookin' fresh.

1164
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:29,194
Hey, let's get together. Let's do this
picture thing real quick. Come on.

1165
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:30,434
Cheese!

1166
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,992
Nova! Hi.

1167
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:57,828
Brandon!
What are you doing here?

1168
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:01,316
Well, I made it back early.
You did it, Nova Prescott.

1169
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:05,399
Starry Night. I mean, it's all
that you said it would be.

1170
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,715
Yeah.

1171
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:10,955
Everything's OK, right?

1172
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:15,432
No. It's not.

1173
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:24,759
She came by herself.

1174
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:29,073
Jordan?

1175
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:32,272
Wow. I can't believe it.

1176
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,116
You know, the first time I met
him, he'd just been in a fight.

1177
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:55,310
Yeah, like father like son.

1178
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:57,954
- What are you talking about?
- Come on, Mom.

1179
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,152
You married a fighter and look where it
got us. Look where it's got me.

1180
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:05,994
I did not marry a fighter.

1181
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:09,430
I married an idiot that got into fights.
There's a difference.

1182
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:13,029
You are a fighter.
You've been through a lot

1183
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:15,355
and you're still here
taking care of this family.

1184
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:18,880
I'd bet on you every time.

1185
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:20,717
Not everybody feels that way.

1186
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:24,194
She does.

1187
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,673
You know, your dad never knew
what the hell was important.

1188
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:33,836
What was worth fighting for.

1189
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:36,990
If he did, he'd be here...

1190
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:39,600
...to see how great you turned out.

1191
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:51,516
Even if it fits,
you're still the bigger man.

1192
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:04,914
Hey.

1193
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,228
Hey.

1194
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:13,278
I was a jerk, Corey.

1195
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:19,511
And I'm sorry.

1196
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:25,911
The band... is back together.

1197
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:29,839
Hold on. Mom! Let's go!

1198
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:32,553
- Hippos forever!
- Oh, yeah!

1199
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:35,592
All right. Top five tragic
band breakups of all time. Go.

1200
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:37,039
Oasis. The Kinks.

1201
01:27:05,560 --> 01:27:08,313
This is awesome!

1202
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:14,156
Go. Have fun.

1203
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:16,395
Really? You sure?

1204
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:20,194
Yes. Go. Enjoy your youth.

1205
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:29,429
Come on!

1206
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:55,234
I can't believe
she dumped Tyler and came alone.

1207
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:57,669
I know. It's awesome.

1208
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:05,273
Hey. Where you been?

1209
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:06,958
They're about to announce
king and queen.

1210
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,276
You didn't break up with Jordan
to be with me.

1211
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:13,393
She dumped you.

1212
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,874
Well, yeah. Technically. But...

1213
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:18,388
You know, Tyler, all you had
to do was tell the truth.

1214
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:22,909
Was that really so difficult...

1215
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:25,394
...to tell the truth
about how you felt?

1216
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:28,639
I mean...

1217
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:41,950
Attention, attention!
We're about to crown the king and queen.

1218
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,719
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have tallied the votes

1219
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:48,036
and are proud to announce
Brookside's new prom king is...

1220
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:52,878
Tyler Barso!

1221
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:57,798
Yeah!

1222
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:03,875
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1223
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:06,992
And what's a king without a queen?

1224
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:09,031
In a landslide win...

1225
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:13,036
Jordan Lundley!

1226
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:32,593
Please make room for the king
and queen's official dance.

1227
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:34,437
No. I'm not
gonna dance with him.

1228
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:37,597
One second. Are you sure?

1229
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:40,913
OK.

1230
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:44,111
At the request of the queen,
she will be sitting this dance out.

1231
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:48,915
So, it'll just be the king's
dance. By order of the queen.

1232
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,158
OK.

1233
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:11,278
Shall we?

1234
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:16,388
Actually, Tyler, there... there's
somewhere else I have to be.

1235
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:36,748
Oh... my... God.

1236
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:46,435
Hey.

1237
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:50,558
Nice dress.

1238
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:06,160
You brought your sister to prom?

1239
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:10,239
Yeah, it's... I can explain.

1240
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:13,232
I think that rocks.

1241
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:24,878
Where have you been?

1242
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:32,559
Amazing. I mean,
that version of "War Craving"?

1243
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:34,238
The best!

1244
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:49,437
Hendrix. Woodstock.

1245
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:03,748
Come on. Let's dance.

1246
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:06,557
I think I'm prom'd out.

1247
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:21,234
Nova!

1248
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,958
The fountain stopped working.

1249
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:29,390
You guys can figure it out
or just leave it off.

1250
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,675
You're here.

1251
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:16,871
Will you go to prom with me?

1252
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:20,114
Yes.

1253
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:39,312
What?

1254
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:44,115
I thought you'd never wear
that sweaty symbol of conformity.

1255
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:46,276
I thought about that,

1256
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:47,878
but then I realised...

1257
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:51,239
...I kinda rock it.

1258
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,476
It's so romantic.

1259
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:23,312
<i>Prom, a night when nice</i>
<i>guys might not finish last.</i>

1260
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:27,229
<i>When friends might</i>
<i>completely surprise you.</i>

1261
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:31,035
<i>When the person you were</i>
<i>throughout high school</i>

1262
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:33,116
<i>could change in an instant.</i>

1263
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:37,151
<i>Maybe you find</i>
<i>what you're looking for.</i>

1264
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:43,631
<i>Or maybe you just</i>
<i>find yourself.</i>

1265
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:48,799
<i>It's true, one night can</i>
<i>bring us all together.</i>

1266
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:50,558
<i>But it's more than that,</i>

1267
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:53,833
<i>'cause when it ends...</i>

1268
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:57,192
<i>... it's really just the beginning.</i>

1269
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:03,073
You're about to kiss me.
