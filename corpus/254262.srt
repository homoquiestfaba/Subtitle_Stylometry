1
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,400
- Faster, Launchpad, faster!
- Slower, Launchpad, slower!

2
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,900
Launchpad, is this a stunt
you learned in flight school?

3
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,200
- Flight school?
- You mean you never took flying lessons?

4
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,600
- l took a crash course.
- Now he tells me.

5
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,100
- Nosedive!
- Cool.

6
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,900
Oh, boy, look at that!

7
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,500
There's the dig!
Did they say what they'd found?

8
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,900
Aye. A hidden chamber.

9
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,100
You think it might have the treasure
of Collie Baba and his 40 thieves?

10
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,600
After all this, l'm not getting my hopes up.

11
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,700
We're making our final approach.

12
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,300
Put seat backs
in their upright position.

13
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,100
Just put the plane
in an upright position.

14
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,900
Please remain seated until
the plane has come to a complete stop.

15
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,100
Landing gear down.

16
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,800
Launchpad, look what you've done
to these ancient ruins.

17
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,500
lt could have been worse.
lt could have been something new.

18
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,100
Hurry, Mr McDuck.
We've found something.

19
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,300
Bless my bagpipes.
An engraving of Collie Baba.

20
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,500
This could well be the treasure chest
of the greatest thief who ever lived.

21
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,100
Let's see.

22
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,700
He stole clothes?

23
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,900
Nothing but old robes.

24
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,600
40 years of searching and l end up
with Collie Baba's dirty laundry.

25
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,700
At least the box is pretty,
Uncle Scrooge.

26
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,100
There's something in this pocket.

27
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,900
The seal of Collie Baba.

28
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,100
lt's a map.

29
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,100
Perhaps this dig
is not a lost cause after all.

30
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,500
That's right. A treasure map
written in Collie Baba's own hand.

31
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,400
At last, after all these centuries,
the lamp will be mine again.

32
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,900
Yes!

33
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,400
You will become more powerful than
locomotive, more faster than speedy bull.

34
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,700
You will leap all buildings
in a single town.

35
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,700
And you shall finally be rewarded
for your dubious assistance.

36
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,600
You mean it?
My own mountain of money?

37
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,300
Yes. Now... give it to me.

38
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,500
- Yes... What?
- The map. Give it to me.

39
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,800
The map? That specific map?
Right here, right now?

40
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,900
You didn't steal it?

41
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,400
Too many people. Only one Dijon.
But look what l did steal.

42
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,700
Several billfolds, this dandy pocket watch,
floss, egg-bake nut bar

43
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,700
and two tickets to the feta cheese festival
for you, master.

44
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,700
Maybe you would like the floss?

45
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,300
Did you at least see where the map leads?

46
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,400
Yes, master.
lnto the middle of the desert.

47
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:45,400
- Where the sand burns like a hot kebab.
- But l searched every square inch.

48
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,100
Perhaps this time l'll let Scrooge
do the searching for me.

49
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,500
Smart move, master.
Let him boil out his brains in the sun.

50
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,600
And you shall
accompany him as his guide.

51
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,800
But l have such sensitive skin.
And my brain boils so quickly.

52
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,300
But who needs brains
to be a guide, anyway?

53
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,300
Gee, Mr McD. A plane ride would
have been less turbulent.

54
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,400
According to the map, the cave
of Collie Baba should be right here,

55
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,300
under the gaze of Mount Badude.

56
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,500
- l don't see anything, Uncle Scrooge.
- Not even a mirage.

57
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,800
Maybe we took the wrong turn
at that last sand dune.

58
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,400
Launchpad, Can't you even ride a camel
without crashing it?

59
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,100
lt's not my fault.
Humpy here just had a great fall.

60
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
He must have hit this lousy rock.

61
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:22,300
- Ouch! My tootsies.
- lt looks like a pint-sized pyramid.

62
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,300
Quackaroonie. lt's bigger than it looks.

63
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,900
- l wonder what's inside.
- There's only one way to find out, lads.

64
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,100
Start digging.

65
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,700
lf l read these hieroglyphics correctly,
we may have found the entrance.

66
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,400
Look at this.

67
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,300
All right. Let's go.

68
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,600
- Me first.
- After you.

69
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But the camels will be lonesome.

70
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,100
- Think we'll see a mummy?
- My mummy's expecting me.

71
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,400
lt's time for my nap.

72
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,600
Careful. Stay close, Webby. No telling
what kind of dangers we may find.

73
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,000
Looks safe to me.

74
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
- Check it out.
- Look at that.

75
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,000
lt's a Collie Baba booby trap.

76
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,600
What does the Junior Woodchuck
Guide Book say about booby traps?

77
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,500
lt says ''Stay alert and use your marbles''.

78
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,500
- Boy, good thing l brought some.
- There's another one.

79
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,800
- That could have given me a boo-boo.
- Just keep the light ahead of us, guide.

80
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,400
Keep going, Dijon.

81
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,200
Maybe one of the children
might be wanting to hold the torch.

82
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,200
Look out!

83
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,000
Do not be fearing.

84
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,300
Dijon shall trip the trap.

85
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
You see?

86
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,500
ls there a doctor in the pyramid?

87
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,800
Gangway. Coming through.

88
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,400
- Jump-start my heart!
- The treasure!

89
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:01,300
- Race you to the rubies.
- Look at those nuggets.

90
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,100
Come on, Dijon!

91
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,400
Look at all that gold.

92
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,200
Collie Baba, you old dog.
l've finally found it.

93
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,700
Look at this.

94
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,700
- What an eyeful.
- What a mouthful.

95
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,400
- The money, the rubies, the diamonds.
- The lamp!

96
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,800
- Pinch me, l'm in heaven.
- l'll get it.

97
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,600
Uncle Scrooge.

98
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:46,100
- Sumo-wrestling scorpions.
- Don't worry. We're safe up here.

99
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,400
- Dijon!
- What? l am not touching a thing.

100
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,800
l am clean, innocent,
like a little baby goat.

101
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,200
- Go get the sacks.
- Sacks?

102
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:03,400
Oh, yes, sacks. Right away.
Anything you say, sir, l do for you.

103
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,000
Where you going to keep
all this treasure?

104
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:14,300
l won't keep it all, Most of these
artefacts will go to museums.

105
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:19,900
- That doesn't sound like Uncle Scrooge.
- That way l enjoy a hefty tax break.

106
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,100
That does.

107
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,700
Looky. Looky. A teapot.

108
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,800
Just an old oil lamp.
Hardly worth taking.

109
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,500
May l have it, Uncle Scrooge?
l can use it for my tea set.

110
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:42,200
- Well...
- Course, this is pretty too.

111
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,100
Here. Don't say your Uncle Scrooge
never gave you anything.

112
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
Thanks.

113
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,000
- That's the last of it.
- You think you can carry it, Launchpad?

114
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,900
No problemo.

115
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,000
Don't lose it.

116
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,700
- Thanks, Dijon.
- Here, l can handle it.

117
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,600
Help!

118
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,100
Allow me.

119
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,700
- Who's that guy?
- Just another tour guide.

120
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:44,700
- Let me light your path.
- l smell a couple of desert rats.

121
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,600
- Uncle Scrooge!
- Hurry!

122
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,300
You thieving dogs! l've spent my life
searching for that treasure.

123
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,600
Poor fool. Too bad you will not live to
know the real treasure you have found.

124
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,500
Farewell.

125
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,200
l knew that weasel's prices
were too good to be true.

126
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What are we gonna do?

127
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,500
- Cut the ropes, lads.
- Hurry, Louie.

128
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,100
Get away! Shoo!

129
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,700
lt's turtle time.

130
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Forward, ho!

131
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
Reverse, ho!

132
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,600
lf you don't stop crashing,
l'll give you the heave-ho.

133
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,000
Do you hear something?

134
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,900
Quick,
let's turn this over and make a boat.

135
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,100
Hurry, Uncle Scrooge.

136
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,900
Here, Webby, you take this.

137
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,300
Come on!

138
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:29,600
lt's here, master. l saw it. Wait till
you see it. You will be pleased as pop.

139
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,400
Well? Where is it?

140
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:42,600
- l do not understand. lt must be here.
- You have it, don't you?

141
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,100
- Where is the lamp?
- They must have it. They must.

142
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,100
Those dirty thieves.
And such sweet children.

143
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,800
l ask you, what is the world coming to?

144
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,800
You let them steal it from you,
you pathetic pickpocket.

145
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:17,000
Don't worry. l will help get it back.
No trouble, you bet, here l come.

146
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,600
Yes, right behind you.

147
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,600
l mean, don't wait, Dijon is on the way.
Mamma!

148
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,400
l'd sure like to know where this leads.

149
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,000
- l'm not so sure you do.
- Boy, are we in trouble.

150
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,300
Either the water is getting higher
or the roof is getting lower.

151
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,300
What a ride.

152
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:14,500
Yeah. l wouldn't mind doing it again.
Now that l know you can live through it.

153
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,700
At least we're all OK.

154
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:29,000
Speak for yourself.
l just lost the treasure of the century.

155
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:38,100
Here, Uncle Scrooge. You can have this
back if it'll make you feel better.

156
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:43,700
That's all right, dear.
lt took me 40 years to find that treasure

157
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,800
and l plan to get it back,
even if it takes another 40.

158
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,800
Hello?

159
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,900
Merlock?

160
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,900
Scrooge?

161
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,400
Where is everybody?

162
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,000
- They have vanished.
- But how?

163
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,000
With the lamp, you fool.

164
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,400
And you will help me get it back,

165
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:14,000
or their sting will seem like
a tickle compared with mine.

166
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,800
- Duckburg Daily News on line one, sir.
- For what?

167
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,400
l believe they want to ask
what happened with the treasure.

168
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,100
None of your business.

169
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,100
Whenever l get my mind off the treasure,
the press presses me about it again.

170
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,400
- l have some news to cheer you up.
- What's that?

171
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:50,100
You've finally received your invitation
to the Archaeological Society ball.

172
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,700
l cannot face those old fossils again.

173
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,100
Every year l tell them
''l'll find Collie Baba's treasure.''

174
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,600
And every year
l come back empty-handed.

175
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,300
But you did have it for a little while.

176
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,500
- Does everyone have to remind me?
- Sorry.

177
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,100
l can't work, Mrs Featherby.
l'm going home.

178
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,900
- But what about your lunch?
- Sell it.

179
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,700
- Here's the polish, Webbigail.
- Thanks, Grammy.

180
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:23,700
As soon as l'm done polishing my teapot,
we can have a tea party with my dollies.

181
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,300
- Thanks for the warning.
- Excuse me, ma'am.

182
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,500
But l've been summoned
to pick up Mr McDuck.

183
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,400
Apparently, he's having
another one of his chipper days.

184
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,000
- Oh, dear.
- Maybe we'd better play outside today.

185
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,000
- Hey.
- What?

186
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,100
lt shook.

187
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,900
- See?
- Quackaroonie!

188
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,500
Well, there's nothing in it.

189
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,100
What is it, a Mexican jumping lamp?

190
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Wonder of wonders!

191
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,400
l'm free at last.

192
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,200
Shabooey!

193
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:26,900
- lt's a genie, isn't it?
- lt's not the tooth fairy.

194
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,600
What the...?

195
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,800
Who are you? Where's Collie Baba?
Did Rome fall yet?

196
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,800
We rubbed the lamp.
We're sorry if we did anything bad.

197
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,600
My new masters.
l am eternally grateful.

198
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,900
Finally, there's room to stretch.

199
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,600
My foot's been asleep for six centuries.

200
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,800
Cool kasbah.
Mind if l look around?

201
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,700
Cold food closet.
Where do you hang the chicken?

202
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,600
- Don't tell me. A rug beater?
- Egg beater.

203
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:18,600
Yes, l see.
Back, you foul eggs. Back l say.

204
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,200
Shabooey, it's alive!

205
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,000
Wait! Come back!

206
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,500
- Where'd he go?
- What do you know?

207
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,700
Las Vegas must be some place
if Caesar moved his palace there.

208
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,400
- What are you doing?
- Catching up on the 20th century.

209
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,800
You read the whole encyclopaedia?

210
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,700
From cover to cover to cover to cover to...

211
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,500
What's this? A baseball? A bowling ball?
Cinderella's ball?

212
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,900
No, it's a globe of the earth.

213
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Get back.

214
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,800
The earth isn't flat?
l must have missed that part.

215
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,800
He has been in that lamp a long time.

216
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,600
- l gotta check this out.
- Wait a second.

217
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,000
- What about our wishes?
- Wishes?

218
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:12,000
- Do l look like a birthday cake?
- Come on, you can't fool us.

219
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:17,700
- A genie's supposed to grant wishes.
- Yeah, three wishes for every master.

220
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,400
- Darn. Everybody remembers that part.
- How does it work?

221
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,000
- How does it work?
- OK!

222
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,700
First you have to hold the lamp.
Then say ''l wish.''

223
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,100
- Yeah?
- Then wish for something.

224
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,200
That's all?
Jeepers. lt's even user-friendly.

225
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:40,100
l know the first wish.
l'm going to wish for a million wishes.

226
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,200
Get serious. That never works.

227
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,800
l guess one of us oughta wish for
peace and happiness all over the world.

228
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:51,700
- These are wishes, not miracles.
- What if we wish for a pet?

229
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,200
- That's more like it.
- l know what l've always wanted.

230
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,200
l wish for a baby elephant.

231
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,500
Oh, no! Please.

232
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,200
Shabooey!

233
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,900
- Now look what you've gone and done.
- What's wrong? She's cute.

234
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:20,000
And big. Big wishes spell big trouble.
The bigger the wish, the bigger the trouble.

235
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:24,800
He's right. One look at that and
Uncle Scrooge'll want to know what's up.

236
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,800
Everyone who sees it will,
and they'll all be fighting over me,

237
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:34,100
and the wishes'll get out of control and
l'll be buried for another 1 ,000 years.

238
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,600
Ah, jeepers. l hadn't thought of that.

239
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,200
So, please, make small wishes.

240
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,300
- lt's our nanny.
- Hurry. Hide the elephant.

241
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,400
Like where?

242
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,000
Shabooey! l'm in trouble already.

243
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,200
We all are.

244
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,800
Elephant! Pink! Hurry!

245
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,500
Down, girl! Please!

246
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,900
Here, Louie, you wish Pinky away.

247
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,200
l'm not wasting one of my wishes.
You do it.

248
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,800
- No way.
- Will somebody do something?

249
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:29,600
Here.
l wish Webby never made her stupid wish.

250
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,000
Let's get outta here
before anybody sees Genie.

251
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
ln here, Mr McDuck.

252
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,800
lt's gone.

253
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,700
Mrs Beakley, is this a ploy
to get some vacation time?

254
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:52,300
lt was here. Honest.
An elephant wearing a big pink bow.

255
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,800
You think l'm crazy, don't you?

256
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,200
Maybe not.

257
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,100
- l think he saw us.
- Quick. Get back in the lamp.

258
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,300
Not the lamp.

259
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,300
The dog house, a madhouse,
even a house of pancakes.

260
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,300
- Anywhere but the lamp.
- ln here.

261
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,800
Hello, Uncle Scrooge.

262
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,100
Hello, Uncle Scrooge.

263
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:33,500
Don't you ''hello'' me. What kind of trick
are you kids playing on Mrs Beakley?

264
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,100
- Who, us?
- Tricks?

265
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,400
- Never.
- Not us, Uncle Scrooge.

266
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,000
Then what's going on?

267
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,100
- Nothing.
- Not much. Nope, not a thing.

268
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,800
What was that?

269
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,700
- The crash in the closet?
- We didn't hear it.

270
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,500
Give me five. Get down,
get bad, get real, get a haircut.

271
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,300
- Who is this?
- G... Er... Gene.

272
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,900
Yeah, G.

273
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,700
- You're new around here?
- Kinda. l pop up every now and then.

274
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,900
He just came over to visit.
For the night.

275
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,500
The night? You mean, sleep over?

276
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,700
- Yeah. Can he?
- Please.

277
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,900
We'll be good Junior Woodchucks.

278
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:23,300
- Woodchuck's promise.
- Ditto.

279
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,400
All right. But stay out of trouble.
l'm in no mood for mischief.

280
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
We're flying now!

281
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:48,200
- What else should we wish for?
- l'd like a small steamboat.

282
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:52,100
Sure. You want that
with or without an ocean?

283
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,600
- A little much?
- Just a tad.

284
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:01,600
l know. l wish for the world's biggest
ice cream sundae.

285
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,700
But not too big.

286
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,500
lce cream sundae, come on down.

287
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,500
Gotta watch out for that wind shear.

288
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,500
- l'm starving.
- That's cos it's getting late.

289
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,600
Betcha Uncle Scrooge'll wonder
why we missed dinner.

290
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,500
Maybe we should go now.

291
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,600
Nah.

292
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,800
Oh, dear. No sign of them yet.
Should l call the police?

293
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,800
Aye, to hold me back
when those rascals finally get home.

294
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,200
They'll be grounded for a month.

295
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:03,100
No video games,
no television and no more friends...

296
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,800
- ..spending the night.
- We're back.

297
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:11,400
Children, l think your uncle
has something to say to you.

298
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,900
Aye. Welcome home.

299
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,200
Can l get you and Gene anything?
Cookies? Milk? lce cream?

300
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:23,500
- No, thanks. We're kind of full.
- And sleepy.

301
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,200
That's because it's past your bedtime.
Scoot along, my wee ones.

302
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,900
Good night, Uncle Scrooge.

303
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,700
- Nighty-night.
- Sleep tight.

304
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,400
That's telling them, sir.

305
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,300
So this is how it feels
to be one of the guys.

306
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:51,300
- lt's all l've ever wished for.
- How many wishes do we have left?

307
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:56,400
- Just my last one. And Webby's.
- We'd better make sure they're special.

308
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,700
lt's him!

309
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,500
Hide me! Hurry! Chase him away!

310
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,700
But it's just an old owl.

311
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,600
- An owl?
- He comes around here every night.

312
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:17,100
l thought it was my meanest master,
the one Collie Baba stole the lamp from.

313
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:23,000
- Your master was a bird?
- He could change into anything.

314
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:27,200
- He's an evil sorcerer.
- But he can't still be alive.

315
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:31,500
- He'd be ancient.
- Yeah. Older than Uncle Scrooge even.

316
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,200
Except his first wish
was to live for ever.

317
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,100
Good wisher.

318
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,800
No.

319
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:45,800
Bad wisher. You don't know.
He made me do the worst things.

320
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,100
Like what?

321
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,300
D'you ever hear of Atlantis?

322
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:56,000
lt was everybody's favourite resort
until Merlock couldn't get reservations.

323
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,500
Then down she went. And poor Pompeii.

324
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,400
Mount Vesuvius would have never blown
its top if Merlock hadn't blown his.

325
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
But what are you worried about?
He used up his wishes.

326
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:18,100
That's just it. Merlock has unlimited
wishes because he has a magic talisman.

327
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,500
lt's what gives him all his powers.

328
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:25,300
And when he puts it on the lamp,
he gets as many wishes as he wants.

329
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,300
Now do you see why l'm a little jumpy?

330
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:35,500
- Maybe we should wish for the talisman.
- That's the one wish l can't do.

331
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,300
You'd have to steal it from him
yourself, and good luck.

332
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,400
Don't worry about
that mean old master now.

333
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,800
He has no idea you're with us.
And that's the way it's gonna stay.

334
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:04,000
There it is. You can drop me off
anywhere along here. But not there.

335
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,400
That's going to leave a nasty mark.

336
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,900
Are you certain
this is where Scrooge lives?

337
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,800
This time l'm very sure. l think.

338
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,600
Then we begin our search.

339
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,900
ln light? But l am not
a popular favourite in that house.

340
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:33,100
- Scrooge find me, he kill me.
- Then stay behind if you wish.

341
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,200
l'll try very hard
to remember you at reward time.

342
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,000
- There's the robber.
- Catch him!

343
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:02,600
Come on, rug, giddy-up!
Gid-up! Upsie-daisy!

344
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,900
- Reach for the chandelier!
- Boys. Tea-party time.

345
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,700
- Not now, Webby.
- We're in the middle of an arrest.

346
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,000
l know someone
who wants to play with me.

347
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,600
Come on, Genie. They don't know
how much fun they're gonna miss.

348
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,700
l told you, l'm not going to the ball.

349
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:36,900
But, sir, l've arranged
for Launchpad to fly you to the launch.

350
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Cancel Launchpad. l'll not only
save face, but my life as well.

351
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:54,800
- You're gonna love playing tea party.
- l know. l read all about it.

352
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:58,700
Can l be the guy who dresses like an
lndian and throws tea off the boat?

353
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,800
No.

354
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:05,000
No, silly.
Not a Boston Tea Party.

355
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,400
l hate rats!

356
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,300
First you pour the tea,...

357
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,400
then take little sips,...

358
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,800
and talk to your guests.

359
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,000
What a lovely dress, Quacky.

360
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,200
Get outta here. No war paint
or tomahawks or anything?

361
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,400
Just you and me and my friends here.

362
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,900
You call these party animals?
They're lifeless.

363
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Genie, you've just given me
the bestest idea in the world.

364
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,600
There is a way to have
all my friends enjoy the party.

365
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,800
l didn't mean it. The less the merrier.

366
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,900
Just you and me and a pot of tea.

367
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:04,200
This'll be fun. l wish
all my toys and dollies were alive.

368
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,000
Shabooey!

369
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,000
lt's so nice to finally meet all of you.

370
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,500
Cookies, anyone?

371
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,700
- Feeding frenzy.
- Dollies, be good.

372
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:45,200
lf there's anything l hate more
than elephants in the house, it's rats.

373
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,400
Here, ratty, come to nanny.

374
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,300
This isn't a house! lt's a zoo!

375
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,400
Wish them back, please.

376
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:13,400
- l can't. That was my last wish.
- l wish you hadn't said that.

377
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:35,100
Oh, dear. Launchpad isn't answering.

378
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,300
He must be on his way.
Won't you go, sir?

379
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,600
Aye, to work. Tell Launchpad
he can take you to the ball.

380
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,200
Since when does a hat
have a mind of its own?

381
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,200
Gotcha!

382
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,000
Watch out for your head, sir.

383
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,200
Master.

384
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,700
Poor nosey.

385
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,200
What is going on?

386
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,500
- What did you do this time?
- l'm sorry. Just make them stop.

387
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:21,400
- But l've only got one wish left.
- Boys, what is going on here?

388
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,500
Well?

389
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,900
Looks like the jig is up.

390
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,400
Go ahead, Louie.

391
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,300
l wish everything was back to normal.

392
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,400
Blow my bagpipes. He's a genie.

393
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,100
Does his mother know about this?

394
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,100
- We were gonna tell you, Uncle Scrooge.
- Someday.

395
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,100
- Where'd he come from?
- Remember my teapot?

396
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,700
Heavenly heather.
The genie in the magic lamp.

397
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,400
The fortunes l could own. l could have
the world's biggest diamond.

398
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,000
No, the world's biggest diamond mine.

399
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:21,200
No, all the diamond mines.
No, the entire mining industry!

400
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,300
Yes!

401
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,500
l can see this will take
some careful thought.

402
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,300
lt's your ride, sir.
Or should l say, my ride.

403
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,700
Are you kidding? l wouldn't miss this
party for all the scones in Scotland.

404
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,500
- But the treasure...
- Aye, the treasure.

405
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,100
The one wish
l don't have to think about twice.

406
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,400
l wish for the treasure of Collie Baba.

407
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,300
Oh, no. Shabooey!

408
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,500
The bonny bounty is mine again.

409
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:05,700
Wait till those old fossils
at the society hear this news.

410
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,500
ln the lamp.
You're coming with me.

411
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:14,400
- Not the lamp. Have a heart.
- Can't he stay with us, Uncle Scrooge?

412
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,100
No. l'm not letting
this wee gold mine out of my sight.

413
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,200
- But he's our friend.
- Nonsense. A genie isn't a person.

414
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,900
A genie is a thing.

415
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,900
- lnside.
- Bye, guys.

416
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,900
lt was great while it lasted.

417
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,100
Don't take him, Uncle Scrooge.

418
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,600
- You can't.
- Let him stay, please.

419
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,500
Poor master. Oh, well.

420
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,600
- Where is the lamp?
- Scrooge has it.

421
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,500
Oh, no!

422
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,700
Music, food, guacamole.

423
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:27,500
lt's a party. Gotta boogie. Gotta bingo.
l gotta get outta this lamp.

424
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,000
- Let me out.
- Can you keep quiet at all?

425
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:34,300
lf you let me out, l'll be as quiet
as a mouse, and just as small.

426
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,800
All right.

427
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:44,800
Look at us! A couple of single guys
out on the town.

428
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,900
Guess again.
You can watch the ball from here.

429
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,300
- Otherwise you go back in the lamp.
- But what if l win the door prize?

430
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,800
Master, all this flip-flapping.

431
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,600
- Maybe we take the bus back.
- Silence.

432
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,800
You shall go through the rear entrance
while l go in the front.

433
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,900
lf Scrooge gets past you,
it'll be your hide.

434
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,700
Here's your soda, sir.

435
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,800
Genie, party of one.

436
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,900
l gotta warn Mr McDuck.

437
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,900
Ladies and gentlemen,
may l have your attention?

438
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,500
We have an important announcement
to make this evening.

439
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,800
Without further ado,
l give you Scrooge McDuck.

440
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,100
l gotta stop him.

441
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,500
l have something l've been wanting
to say for 40 years.

442
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,600
lt is my good fortune to announce

443
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,400
that this year l have finally
brought to Duckburg

444
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,100
the legendary,
the infamous treasure of...

445
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,400
lt's Merlock, my old master.

446
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,700
lt's that back-stabbing banshee.

447
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,500
He's too powerful. He could destroy you.

448
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,500
l'll save you. Left, right! Go!

449
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,100
Follow me.

450
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,500
- Hurry.
- You are a loon.

451
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,700
- What are you doing?
- Quick, you gotta wish us outta here.

452
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,100
Not me.
These wishes are worth a fortune.

453
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,400
What's more important -
a fortune or your life?

454
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:19,500
- Well...
- lt's not exactly a trick question.

455
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,200
- He's got a bear?
- He is a bear.

456
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,800
Make us a little getaway wish. Please!

457
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:31,000
No, we stand our ground.

458
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,300
l've got one trick
that might save us, l hope.

459
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,600
Going up.

460
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,600
Bad housekeeping. lt looks like
they have skipped the coop.

461
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,800
lt was not my fault.
They did not get past Dijon.

462
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:05,500
lt was not your fault either, master.
No.

463
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:12,000
Just keep searching while
l hunt outside. They will not escape.

464
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:16,500
As you wish, master, l do for you.

465
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:27,700
- l can't hear anything. They're gone.
- Where are we?

466
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:32,000
- Well, it's not exactly the Ritz.
- Not the lamp.

467
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,500
You get used to the smell
after a few hundred years.

468
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,300
- Can you move your elbow?
- Get me out of here!

469
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:46,100
Do you have to yell at me all the time?

470
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,100
l wouldn't be in this mess
if it weren't for you.

471
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,100
Thanks to you,
l've got a crazy animal act on my tail.

472
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,400
That's it, blame the genie.

473
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,100
- l only saved your life.
- Sorry.

474
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:02,000
lt's not my fault Merlock's after me.
l didn't ask to be Mr Popular.

475
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,900
All l want is a life of my own,
like your nephews.

476
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:10,400
With my own bike,
a stack of comic books, a sled.

477
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:15,500
Maybe some ski equipment, a CD player,
my own home video entertainment system.

478
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,300
All right.

479
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,400
Oh, no, it's Merlock! Hide me!

480
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,800
l've got to get you to my vault.
lt's the only safe place.

481
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:28,500
- Time to go back.
- But you saw what a dump it is.

482
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,300
Sorry, Genie, but the party's over.

483
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,000
And just when we were
getting to be buddies.

484
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,900
Scrooge.

485
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:08,600
Mr McDuck! Mr McDuck!
Are you all right? What's going on?

486
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:18,100
Come out, whoever you are.

487
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,800
Wait till Merlock sees this.
He will be so grateful.

488
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,900
l can see my mountain of money now.

489
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,900
Wait. Why give him the lamp?

490
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:40,200
Because the master wants it so badly.

491
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,600
But with the lamp,
you'll be the big cheese,

492
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,400
the hot falafel,
the most powerful person on earth.

493
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,400
Great master.

494
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,100
Master?

495
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,200
Master Dijon?

496
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:59,700
l like it. l really like it.

497
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:04,000
Launchpad!
Get me out of here fast.

498
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,100
- Dull party, Mr McD?
- Go! Now!

499
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:48,400
Don't plan on landing. l don't have time
for any more disasters.

500
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:58,300
- Good morning, Scrooge, sir.
- What's going on?

501
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,800
At the urging of my genie,
l have decided to seek my fortune.

502
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:08,500
l never thought he'd wish for
your fortune, Mr McDuck, l swear.

503
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,600
The lamp?

504
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,200
- Gravy?
- That's right.

505
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,900
l get the loot, you get the boot.

506
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:23,000
You can't do this. Put me down.

507
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,500
l'm your boss, not that bum.

508
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,700
Take him downtown.

509
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:34,300
You can forget about
this year's Christmas bonus.

510
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,300
Whose name do you think
is on this... building?

511
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,500
Dijon? lt really is his.

512
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:22,800
Wiped out with a wish.
lf l ever get my money back,

513
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:28,000
l promise l'll never make
another wish for myself again.

514
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,500
There's someone to see you, Mr McDuck.

515
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Lads. Webby.

516
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,100
Uncle Scrooge!

517
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,200
Uncle Scrooge.

518
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,000
Sir, good to see you.

519
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,900
Mr McDuck, l'm so sorry.

520
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:59,500
There, Mr Beakley. l know.

521
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:04,600
- We all chipped in to set bail.
- We even emptied our banks.

522
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:08,500
Don't worry. l'll pay you all back
with cash at the mansion.

523
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,000
- The mansion?
- He hasn't heard.

524
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:13,100
Heard what?

525
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:16,700
Mr McDuck, l'm so sorry.

526
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Dijon has everything -
the mansion, the factories.

527
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,700
Even your spat collection, sir.

528
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,900
Mr McDuck!

529
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,200
Our home. Our beautiful home.

530
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,500
There, there. l know, ma'am. l know.

531
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:43,100
First my Money Bin, now this.

532
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:49,900
Well, at least we have each other.
Think of poor Genie.

533
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,900
lf only there was a way
to sneak in and get back the lamp.

534
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,600
But there's so many alarms.

535
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,700
Aye. Hundreds.

536
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,900
And 1 4,657 ways
to trigger them.

537
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:08,600
And you know each and every one,
don't you, Uncle Scrooge?

538
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,500
Aye.

539
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,800
And maybe the way to shut 'em off?

540
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,800
Aye.

541
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:22,700
Come, lads. Something tells me
we should plan a full-scale invasion.

542
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,200
Delicious.

543
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:36,100
Delicious. Good golly, everything smells
more delicious when you're rich.

544
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,900
- Even me.
- Shouldn't we be bird-watching?

545
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,900
Don't worry about Merlock.

546
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,300
He would not dare to confront
the great and powerful Dijon.

547
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:52,200
Anyway,
l don't think he knows about me yet.

548
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:13,500
l've got the Bin at 1 2 o'clock high,
Mr McD. Give or take 1 0 minutes.

549
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,300
Snuggy enough, sir?

550
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,900
All right, lads. Operation Lift the Lamp
is about to commence.

551
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,300
Roger, Uncle Scrooge. Over and out.

552
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,700
See anyone coming,
Commander Beakley?

553
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,600
- l don't think so.
- Then wish us luck.

554
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,200
This is it.

555
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:59,000
C... A... S... H.

556
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,900
Remember, only step on the white tiles.

557
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:33,000
- l'm on the roof.
- And we're inside.

558
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:37,400
Good. All you have to do
is break into the security room.

559
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,300
Don't worry. We're almost there.

560
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,700
That's easy for you to say.

561
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:48,100
Keep going, Webby.
lf you can't get through, no one can.

562
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,600
Attagirl!

563
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:57,300
There's the alarm panel.

564
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:04,100
l've got Uncle Scrooge's directions
to keep from getting zapped.

565
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,500
Two steps up the middle.

566
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:12,100
One step to the right,
three steps forward,

567
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,600
and... five steps...

568
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:22,100
You'd better get back here.

569
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:30,600
Good thing you had your hairnet.

570
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,200
- What are we gonna do?
- Use our marbles.

571
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:37,300
Marbles.

572
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,300
You don't have to worry
about any alarms, Uncle Scrooge.

573
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,100
Good work, lads. l'm going in.

574
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,100
Genie, l've decided on my first
important act as a rich man.

575
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:28,300
l shall plan a vacation. l wonder
which country l shall be visiting first.

576
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:39,000
Are you sure it's safe to travel?
Merlock could be close.

577
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:45,000
Do not worry, Genie, l have planned
to take a small army of bodyguards.

578
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,600
Whoever said that money
can't buy peace of mind

579
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:52,700
must have had the brains
of a garbanzo bean.

580
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,500
Oh, no!

581
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,000
Give that back, you dirty...

582
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:08,500
Please, Merlock.
No wishes. l can't take 'em.

583
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:14,200
Relax. lt's going to be
like old times again.

584
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,400
Come on. We gotta help.

585
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:25,700
My talisman now gives me
unlimited wishes, Scrooge.

586
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,500
- And where are you going?
- Just outside, master.

587
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,300
You and Genie
have so much to catch up on,

588
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:40,400
l thought you might be wanting
a few minutes alone.

589
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:44,200
- l know l would.
- Genie.

590
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:48,900
l wish you would turn this
disloyal swine into something fitting.

591
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,500
Just like old times all right.

592
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:07,700
And now, Genie, l wish
you would transform this mundane Bin

593
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,900
into a fortress
more worthy of its new owner.

594
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Remember our magnificent old home?

595
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,000
Yeah. Casa de Coo-coo.

596
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,200
My money!

597
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:54,400
- Come on!
- Wait for me.

598
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:06,100
Help!

599
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,700
Here, Webby, hold on!

600
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,800
My heavens!

601
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:04,500
l'm so sorry, Mr McDuck.

602
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,800
And now, Genie,
l wish to return home in my new home.

603
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:12,800
Will you never stop?

604
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,000
This cannot be happening.

605
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:45,800
You maniac. Return the Bin before
l stuff that lamp down your throat.

606
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:49,600
- Bad move.
- You threaten me?

607
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:55,700
Please, Merlock. He's had a lousy day.

608
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:58,400
Maybe a hot bath
and a warm glass of milk...

609
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:02,600
Silence. l wish you would
cast him out of my house.

610
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,700
No!

611
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,200
- l can't.
- Do it.

612
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:12,000
l have no choice.

613
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,200
l understand.

614
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,500
- Good shot.
- Get it, guys!

615
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,900
Uncle Scrooge!

616
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:03,400
l'll be back for you.

617
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,700
No!

618
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,000
No!

619
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:31,500
Laugh at me, will you?
l'll show you.

620
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,100
Give that back, you flea-bitten buzzard!

621
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,700
My talisman!

622
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:46,700
This time you have to make a wish.

623
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:51,800
Aye. l wish me and my family and my Bin
were back in Duckburg.

624
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,900
Right now.

625
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,300
Good wishing.

626
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,700
Duckburg never looked so good.

627
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,400
Aye,
but it cannot beat my view, laddies.

628
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,700
Has any heather
ever looked more heavenly?

629
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:43,600
And you still have the lamp,
Uncle Scrooge.

630
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:47,600
Aye. And one more wish to go.

631
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:50,100
You sound like you know what it is.

632
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:53,900
l'm going to stop all this magic.

633
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:58,200
Even if l must wish for the lamp
to be buried in the centre of the earth.

634
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,600
- What?
- No! You can't.

635
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:04,100
- Oh, no!
- But Genie'll be gone for ever.

636
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,500
Aren't we overreacting?

637
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,300
We could... hide him in the vault.

638
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,800
And we'll dress him up like a boy
and keep him in our room.

639
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:16,900
Just like before.

640
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,500
Genie, get ready to grant my last wish.

641
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,600
And yours too.

642
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
What do you mean?

643
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:30,100
l wish the genie
would turn into a real boy.

644
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,500
Shabooey!

645
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:59,700
l'm a boy.

646
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,300
l'm a real boy.

647
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:08,700
Now l can do
all the things real boys do.

648
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:12,800
Run through fields,
play catch, roll over.

649
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,800
Wait. That's a dog.

650
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:20,900
Uncle Scrooge. What about the lamp?

651
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,900
Look. Without the genie,
it's wasting away.

652
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,500
How can l ever thank you, master?

653
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:42,100
l'm not your master any more.

654
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:46,300
That's right.
Can l call you Uncle Scrooge?

655
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,700
You're a sweet kid.
But don't press your luck.

656
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:54,300
What do you wanna do
on your first day as a boy?

657
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,600
Let me put it this way -

658
01:05:56,700 --> 01:06:00,000
you'll never catch me, coppers.

659
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:03,300
Oh, boy! l'm gonna getcha!

660
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,400
Are you coming with us, Uncle?

661
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,500
You go ahead, Webby, dear.

662
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:11,000
We quadzillionaires
have our own ideas of fun.

663
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:24,800
- You!
- Scrooge, sir. Oh, good golly,

664
01:06:24,900 --> 01:06:29,000
What a time we have been having.
Yes. l was just now leaving. Goodbye.

665
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:33,100
- But it's only some loose change.
- l'll change your face, you thief!

666
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,600
Somebody stop those pants.

667
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:44,700
<i>Life is like a hurricane</i>
