2
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,602
Whoa, what are you
drawing, Vee?

3
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,229
It's a bunch of bats

4
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,064
flying through
a pitch‐black forest
at midnight!

5
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,899
I used
my Transylvania chalk set.

6
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,485
Remember, Bridget.

7
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,820
It's just a drawing.

8
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,280
It's just a‐‐

00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:13,949
Eek! Bats!

10
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,367
Ah, sorry!

11
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,494
Transylvanian chalk
is a little more magical

12
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,496
than the stuff
humans draw with!

13
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,541
That's okay. I should be
used to it by now.

14
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:23,750
But I'm not.

15
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,044
Vee! Poppy!
Bridget! Look!

16
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,339
We must be getting
new neighbors.

17
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,175
I hope there are
some kids our age!

18
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,219
Hmmm.

19
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,557
Oh, hey there, I'm Edgar!

20
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:42,269
Greetings! I. Am. Drake.

21
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,645
Huh?

22
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,314
Sorry.

23
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:46,606
I kinda do weird voices
when I'm nervous.

24
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,233
Heh. How's it going?

25
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,193
Hi! I'm Vampirina.

26
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,611
‐This is Bridget,
Poppy, and‐‐

27
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,196
Edgar Peepleson!

28
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:58,076
World famous weekly web show
host with almost 15 viewers!

29
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:01,580
Hmm. You sure
like bats, huh?

30
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,081
Yeah, they're my favorite!

31
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,208
I really like
dark and spooky stuff.

32
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,752
Awesome! I do, too!

33
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:09,338
Say... where are you
moving from?

34
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:13,175
Oh! I'm from
somewhere faaaar away.

35
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,677
Sorry. Did it again!

36
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,929
Heh.
Still a little nervous.

37
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,473
Don't worry about it.

38
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,475
Even I go a little "batty"
when I'm nervous.

39
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,393
Are you gonna be
starting at school soon?

40
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,686
Tomorrow, actually.

41
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,271
I know how it feels
to be the new kid.

42
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:29,483
It can be a little scary,
and not in the good way.

43
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:30,942
But we'll show you around.

44
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,320
Yeah. Like
where the cafeteria is

45
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,115
and which water fountain
won't spray you in the face.

46
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,700
That's an important one.

47
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,203
Drake!
Will you grab a moving box

48
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:42,454
and bring it inside?

49
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,373
Coming, Mom! Well...

50
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:47,167
I'll...
See. You. Tomorrow.

51
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,710
Bye!

52
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,129
Wow, he's pretty fast.

53
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,340
He could give you
a run for your money, Vee.

54
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,549
Totally!

55
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,468
He seems
really nice, too!

56
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:57,969
Wait a minute!

57
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,847
He didn't seem...
suspicious to you?

58
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,058
Suspicious?
What do you mean?

59
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,310
The bat shirt.
The bat belt buckle.

60
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,563
Saying he's from "far away."

61
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,191
Let me see.

62
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,734
Aha! Here it is.

63
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,278
I knew all that
sounded familiar.

64
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,364
Drake's a vampire!

65
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:20,033
Vampires? Here?

66
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,327
I don't know about that.

67
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,664
Yeah. There's, uh,
no such thing as vampires!

68
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:29,042
And even if there were,
could you imagine one
living here?

69
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,836
In Pennsylvania?

70
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,755
Vampires are real!
And Drake is one of them!

71
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,132
I'll prove it!

72
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,844
Hi, loyal viewers

73
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,971
and welcome
to "Weekly Weirdness:

00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,181
<i>Vampire Edition."</i>
<i>Here we see‐‐</i>

75
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,142
<i>Edgar, what are you doing?</i>

76
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:49,688
I'm trying to get
some proof on camera
that Drake's a vampire.

77
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,357
Uh, maybe you
should do something else

78
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,776
for your web show,
like, uh...

79
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,361
Mr. Gore's pet hamster!

80
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,656
He's not spooky,
but he's pretty cute!

81
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,825
I don't think so, Vee.

82
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:05,078
My guidebook says vampires
are always walking among us,

83
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,956
and I'm determined
to get one on camera.

84
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,374
You just have to look
for the signs.

85
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,750
‐Vampires have fangs.
‐

86
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,836
They usually sleep
during the day

87
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,296
and stay awake at night,

88
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,380
can't stand garlic,

89
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,424
and they can turn
into a bat!

90
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,760
Don't worry.
It's not like Edgar's

91
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,596
actually
gonna find anything.

92
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,473
You just need to let him
do his thing.

93
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:27,476
Once he realizes
Drake is a human,
he'll let it go.

94
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,978
‐
‐Yeah, I guess you're right.

95
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,481
‐ Drake!
‐Oh! Hey, there.

96
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:33,690
Did you have
a good first day?

97
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,568
No one, um,
bothered you, did they?

98
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,361
Nothing besides
that spraying drinking fountain

99
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,946
Bridget was talking about.

100
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,573
‐Told ya!
‐Yeah.

101
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,533
Farewell until tomorrow!

102
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,453
Sounds like Edgar gave up
on looking for vampires!

103
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,704
You were right, Poppy!

104
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,456
Vee! I proved it!

105
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,208
Look at this!

<i>I, Edgar Peepleson,</i>

00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:59,216

<i>with a real, live vampire.</i>

109
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:02,844
<i>Today the proof</i>

110
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:06,556
<i>First, vampires like dark</i>
<i>and spooky stuff! Check!</i>

111
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,183
<i>Second,</i>
<i>they stay awake at night</i>

112
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,560
<i>and sleep</i>
<i>during the day. Check.</i>

113
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,730

114
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,232
<i>And there you have it!</i>

115
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,025
<i>This is Edgar Peepleson</i>

116
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,569
<i>"You stay weird, Pennsylvania!"</i>

117
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,613
I don't really think
that proves anything.

118
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,199
But‐‐
but the black paint.

119
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,951
And sleeping in class?

120
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,994
And what kind of monster
doesn't like garlic bread!?

121
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,454
Vampires!

122
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,790
Maybe Drake just doesn't
like garlic bread.

123
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,083
It could happen.

124
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:36,336
Yeah. Maybe...

125
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,463
I'll just have to keep looking.

126
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,340
And that's my brother,
everybody.

127
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,092
You okay, Vee?

128
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:46,096
Well, I guess I'm just thinking
that Edgar might be right.

129
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,764
‐Huh?!
‐Really?!

130
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,099
It's a long shot,

131
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:52,561
but Drake could be
a vampire.

132
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:55,605
Let's go ask my parents
just to make sure.

133
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,650
Another vampire?
In Pennsylvania?

134
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,611
‐At least Edgar thinks so.
‐Is it possible?

135
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,531
We haven't heard
anything from the spooks
or ghouls back home.

136
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,576
But Drake's family could be
one of those vampire families

137
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:10,370
from northern Transylvania.

138
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,205
They tend
to keep to themselves.

139
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:17,002
But he doesn't really look
like a vampire.

140
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,546
We vampires come
in all shapes and sizes.

141
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:21,923
You should never judge
a ghoul by its cover.

142
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,800
Yeah! I mean,
look at Gregoria!

143
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,260
She looks pretty grumpy,

144
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,929
but she's actually
fangtastically lovable!

145
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,514
Of course I am!

146
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,558
So what do I do, Papa?

147
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,518
I can't talk to Drake
about vampire stuff

148
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,604
unless I know
for sure he is one!

149
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,607
Ah! We'll just have
to find out.

150
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,997
<i>♪ If I had</i>
<i>to take a guess ♪</i>

151
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:54,265
Wow. Maybe Drake
really is a vampire!

152
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,477
If it's true, we'll have
to give him and his family

153
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,896
a proper welcome
to the neighborhood.

154
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:03,566
We'll make him one
of our famous Hauntley
gift bat‐skets.

155
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,610
Terrifying idea,
my spook!

156
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,737
I'll go get
some cobwebs to weave!

157
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,989
‐
‐ Yeah! Cool!

158
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,950
Edgar! And Drake?!

159
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,536
Heading to... my house!

160
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:17,163
If Drake
really is a Vampire‐‐

161
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,625
Then Edgar could put him
on "Weekly Weirdness"
for everyone to see!

162
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,668
We better head
over there.

163
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,294
‐Whoa!
‐Oh!

164
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,754
Right away.

165
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,674
At least we know
Vee is definitely a vampire.

166
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,134
Thanks
for inviting me over.

167
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,844
You have that weirdness
web show, right?

168
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,470
I'm into
weird stuff, too!

169
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,639
Like aliens and monsters
and stuff!

170
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,768
Yeah, my web show
is pretty...

171
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:39,853
Boo!

172
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,855
Um... aah?

173
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,524
‐
‐ Edgar, Drake, hey!

174
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,360
Hope it's cool,
I invited the girls over.

175
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,739
Drake, is it okay if we talk
to Edgar for a minute?

176
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:53,283
Edgar what
are you doing now?!

177
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,827
I'm gonna get the final piece
of proof I need!

178
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,912
My guidebook says
if a vampire is startled,

179
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,706
they'll turn into a bat.

180
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:05,003
So all I need to do
is get Drake turning
into a bat on camera.

181
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,964
But I think what he could
really use right now
is a friend.

182
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,175
That's what helped me
when I was the new kid.

183
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,176
- ‐Uh‐huh...
- ‐

184
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:12,761
Hey, Drake, uh,

185
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,345
you want to head
to the kitchen for a snack?

186
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,764
Sure!

187
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,558
How about some apple slices?

188
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,310
Sounds applicious!

189
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,228
Great, then here you go!

190
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,856
‐Aha!
‐Aah!

191
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,858
Aah!

192
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:29,819
Drake, why don't you go
check out Edgar's room?

193
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,781
He's got a bunch
of cool toys in there.

194
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,450
What is it?

195
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,285
Um, nothing!
You go ahead.

196
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,370
Uh, we'll
be in there in a minute.

197
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,664
Yes. Now's my chance.

198
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,792
C'mon, Drake!

199
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,001
‐
‐Are you okay, Vee?

200
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,753
I am now.

201
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,339
But that camera flash gave me
a bad case of the battys.

202
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:51,299
If Edgar takes
a picture of Drake,

203
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,842
and he is a vampire,

204
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,886
he'll definitely transform!

205
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,346
You like UFO's, too?

206
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,098
My mom says aliens
aren't real,

207
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,766
but I totally
believe in them.

208
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,352
Take me to your leaderrrr.

209
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,104
What's not
to love about UFOs?

210
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,939
‐Turn brightness
all the way up...
‐

211
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,441
and all set.

212
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,401
Hey, uh, over here!

213
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,611
Nooo!

214
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,239
Cheese?

215
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,950
Huh? Drake you're...

216
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,284
Human?!

217
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,703
Well, yeah, of course I am!

218
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,542
Wait, what did you
think I was?

219
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:26,751
A vampire!

220
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,837
Well, that would be
pretty cool,

221
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,131
but, nope!
Just a boring human.

222
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:33,508
But your bat shirt
and belt buckle,

223
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,552
and you don't
eat garlic bread!

224
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,719
Would you want garlic breath

225
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,555
on your first day
at a new school?

226
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,806
P.U.!

227
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,559
Uh... I guess not.

228
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,102
And I like a lot of stuff
that's different,

229
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,521
so it takes kids
a little while
to figure me out.

230
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,148
It can be hard
when you're different, y'know?

231
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,900
More than you know, Drake!

232
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,280
Vee seemed pretty different
when she first moved
to Pennsylvania.

233
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,826
But we realized
that her being
different is sooo cool!

234
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,661
Just like you!

235
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,872
So you've got at least
three friends at school now.

236
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:06,749
Three friends?
Don't you mean four?

237
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,668
You said
you like UFO's, right?

238
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,296
Yeah! I mean,
not as much as Bigfoot.

239
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,923
You... like... Bigfoot?!

240
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,384
We gotta get working
on the next "Weekly Weirdness!"

241
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,470
Whadaya say... co‐host?

242
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,431
Sounds. Good. To. Me.

243
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,726
And sorry I thought
you were a vampire.

244
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,436
It's cool!

245
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,646
I guess that's why you should
never judge a ghoul,

246
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:31,816
or human, by their cover!

247
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:35,820
Girls, how'd everything go
with our new neighbors?

248
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,655
Should we bring over
the bat‐sket?

249
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,532
It's almost done.

250
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:43,036
As long as Demi doesn't keep
eating the icky‐sticky caramels.

251
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,249
We'll take your word
for it, you goofy ghost.

252
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,668
It turns out that Drake
is human after all.

253
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,587
Well, I'll be
a mummy's uncle.

254
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,714
I guess even humans
can fool monsters!

255
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:58,676
And I guess that means we get
to keep the gift bat‐sket!

256
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:03,514
I'm sorry you didn't get
a new vampire friend, batkins.

257
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,893
That's okay! I have
the world's best human friends.

258
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,853
And now Drake does, too!

259
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,402
<i>"The Scare B and Vee!"</i>

260
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,989
56, 57, 58, 59...

261
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,366
Hmm.

262
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,993
‐60!
‐Ah, thank you, Demi.

263
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,537
We're all set
for the Scare Fair!

264
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:29,123
Do you think you'll sell
a lot of magic quilts
this year, Papa?

265
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,334
I have a feeling
they'll fly off the shelves!

266
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:32,877
I got this!

267
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:36,464
Especially my super
spooktacular soaring quilt.

268
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:40,218
Papa, can I see
just one quilt
do its magic?

269
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:42,011
Well, they're all packed up.

270
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,429
Pleeeease?

271
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,556
How can you say no
to those fangs?

272
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,225
All right. Just one.

273
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,520
- ‐ Hey, now!
- ‐ Whoa!

274
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,521
There it goes!

275
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,563
Whoa!

276
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:53,815
‐Aah!
‐Aah!

277
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,108
How do you get it
to stop?

278
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,859
Normally, you have
to tuck the quilt

279
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,987
into bed to calm it down.

280
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:03,825
But in this case, my super speed
will do the trick.

281
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:04,993
‐Ohh‐la‐la!
‐Wowza!

282
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,371
Aw, I wish
I could go with you.

283
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:11,040
Well, then who would
take care of the guests?

284
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,794
Guests? I didn't know
we had guests coming
to the Scare B&B.

285
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,922
Well, Vee, Papa and I both
think you are becoming

286
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:21,050
such a responsible
little vampire,

287
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,929
we thought we could trust you
to host our next guests.

288
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:28,725
Wow! I'm gonna be in charge
of the Scare B&B all by myself?

289
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:32,020
Demi, Gregoria, and Chef Remy
will be here to help, of course.

290
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,313
- ‐ Yeah!
- ‐ Right!

291
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,148
And the guests
are zombies.

292
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,484
They mostly just drool,
groan, and zombie‐walk.

293
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,902
And then drool some more.

294
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,030
Wow! My very first time

295
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,532
hosting guests
without Mama and Papa!

296
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,826
I know
you'll make us proud!

297
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,455
Goodbye, batkins.
See you tomorrow!

298
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:51,914
Goodbye, baticakes!

299
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,875
Bye, Mama. Bye, Papa.

300
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,419
Have a fangtastic time
at the Scare Fair!

301
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:59,964
Yes! I can't believe
I'm the host of the Scare B&B!

302
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,300
Everything has to be
perfect for the zombies!

303
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,595
I want to make the B&B
extra spooky‐special for them!

304
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,180
Oh, they
won't need much, Vee.

305
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,390
Really you just have
to watch out for the drool.

306
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,893
Our main job will be
staying out of their way!

307
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,895
But this is my first time
in charge,

308
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:16,147
and Mama and Papa
are trusting me.

309
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,899
I don't want to let them down.

310
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:20,485
I want to make
the B&B as spooky as can be.

311
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,964
<i>‐</i>
<i>‐</i>

312
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,948

‐

313
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,253
‐
‐The zombies are here!

314
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,923
Welcome, zomb‐‐

315
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,050
Huh?

316
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,969
Okay, Those look

317
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,512
like the most
upbeat zombies
I've ever seen!

318
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:30,972
That's
because they're not zombies!

319
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,974
Humans!

320
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,267
Well, hello there!

321
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:38,062
Um, hi,
Mr. and Mrs...

322
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,981
uh...

323
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,482
Zombiés.

324
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,110
Most people say "Zombies."
It's a common mistake.

325
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,947
So you're not real zombies?

326
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,615
‐Zo‐‐
‐

327
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,409
Oh, no! Oh, we‐‐

328
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:52,994
We might be
a little tired,

329
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,745
but I don't think
we look that bad!

330
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,875
‐
‐Oh, my.

331
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,418
Uh heh.

332
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,379
So, may we come in?

333
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,591
Oh! Uh, sure!
Of course you can come in.

334
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:10,219
Because you're our guests,
and I'm your hostess
with the ghostest.

335
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,096
I mean... mostest.

336
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,850
Um, I'm Vampirina,
by the way.

337
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,228
Oh, Vampirina.
What an usual‐‐ Oh!

338
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,021
Ew! Yech!

339
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,689
Sorry about that!

340
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,107
‐
‐Uh‐‐

341
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,442
what was that?

342
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,277
I... didn't
hear anything.

343
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,780
Okay, I heard that.

344
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,991
Will you excuse me
for just a second?

345
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,661
I just remembered I left
the... refrigerator...
door... open.

346
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,247
Be right back.

347
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,832
This is terrible!

348
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,250
Huh! You're telling me!

349
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,377
Now I can't serve
ze ice scream!

350
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:49,050
What I mean is,
the guests are human,
so they can't see you.

351
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,052
Which means you can't help!

352
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,386
Now, don't worry, Vee.

353
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,555
Speak for yourself!
I'd worry!

354
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,391
How's Vee supposed to host
those humans all by herself?

355
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,018
She won't have to.

356
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,229
This ghostess with the mostest
has an idea!

357
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,648
Vee, even though we can't
be out there with you,

358
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,816
we'll be nearby
the whole time.

359
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:09,320
<i>Oui!</i> We'll help you
every step of the way.

360
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,821
Sounds like a plan to me!

361
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,114
Uh, Vampirina!

362
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,950
I'd better get back!

363
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,076
Huh?

364
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:18,746
I'm back!

365
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,623
Vampirina,
I gotta ask you.

366
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,876
Are there any grown‐ups
here, uh, at all?

367
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,379
Um, well,
of course there are.

368
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,214
One adult here!

369
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:32,093
In fact, I've been
an adult for 400 years!

370
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:33,094
Pardon me?

371
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,929
Cheese and crackers?

372
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,139
‐ Oh, my!
‐Oopsy daisy.

373
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:41,644
Uh, ha! Did I mention
he's a chef and a magician?

374
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,232
I'm gonna need
a little more help
than this!

375
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,900
Thanks for coming.

376
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,235
Are you kidding?

377
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,279
Helping you host
at the Scare B&B?

378
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,281
It's a dream come true!

379
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,032
‐
‐

380
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,535
So, what do we do first?

381
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,245
How about you show
the guests to their room?

382
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,913
Got it!

383
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:04,542
Hello! May I kindly
show you to your room?

384
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,669
Why, allow me!

385
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:11,674
Whew! Okay, Poppy and Bridget
are taking care of the guests.

386
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,342
And what are we
supposed to do?

387
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,844
Stand around
like a pile of rocks?

388
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,929
Don't be silly,
Gregoria.

389
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,432
You're supposed
to be standing around
like a pile of rocks.

390
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,892
There's nothing
rock‐like about me.

391
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,061
What we need to do is
un‐spook the rest of the house

392
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,480
before the guests
discover anything else!

393
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,024
Then let's do this!

394
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,571
<i>‐</i>
‐

395
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,122
The guests are
in their room.

396
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,708
And the house
is de‐spookified!

397
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:49,170
Now all I have
to do is make sure
I'm the perfect host!

398
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,504
Uh, for humans.

399
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,923
- ‐Excuse me, Vampirina?
- ‐

400
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,635
Mrs. Zombiés!
How may we haunt you.

401
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,928
I mean, help you?

402
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,181
I can never read the small print
on these bottles

403
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,183
if I don't have my glasses.

404
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:05,353
Uh, could you tell me
which one is the bubble bath?

405
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,855
It's this one.
Here, I'll open it for you.

406
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,023
Thank you, dear.

407
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,983
Uh‐oh. Poppy. Wait!

408
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,443
‐It's not regular
bubble bath!
‐Huh?!

409
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:13,444
It's...

410
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:15,821
‐Aaah!
‐Oh! Oh, my!

411
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,906
Bubble bath potion!

412
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:21,619
Oh, boy.
That is a lot of bubbles!

413
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,038
Get me down from here!

414
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,414
‐We're trying!
‐Hang on!

415
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,209
Uh, we don't like
to skimp on bubbles!

416
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,377
I got this!

417
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:31,837
Aah!
Bad bubbles! Bad!

418
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,423
‐Demi!
‐That did not
work as planned!

419
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,217
Help! Heeeellllpp!

420
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:37,343
I gotcha buddy!

421
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:39,428
‐Aah!
‐Unh!

422
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,971
Oh!

423
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,348
Hee hee. Thank you.

424
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:47,436
Bubble trouble
stop on the double!

425
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:51,273
Oh! What on earth
was that?!

426
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,943
I'm so sorry,
Mrs. Zombiés!

427
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:57,363
It must have been a broken pipe
from under the floor.

428
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,074
You know how old and creaky
they can get.

429
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,367
Heh.

430
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,244
Come on, Mrs. Zombiés.

431
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,413
We'll walk you
back to your room.

432
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,957
And get you a towel...
or ten.

433
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,418
You okay, Vee?

434
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:13,379
Yeah. But being a host
at the Scare B&B

435
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,755
is harder than I thought.

436
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,341
And a lot soapier!

437
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,554
You sure you don't
want us to stay?

438
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,347
Now that the Zombiés
are going to bed,

439
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,807
I think we'll be okay.

440
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,267
‐
‐Good!

441
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,479
I mean, it was fun
helping, but...

442
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,022
It wasn't easy.

443
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,399
At least we don't
have to worry

444
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,317
about any other
spooky stuff happening.

445
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:38,487
Mmm. It's smooth‐screaming
from here on out.

446
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:43,409
‐ Okay, bye!
‐Bye, Vee!

447
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:46,495
<i>‐Eeek!</i>
‐It's an eek‐mail
from Mama!

448
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,205
<i>Hello, Vee!</i>

449
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,040
<i>We're having a fangtastic time</i>
<i>at the Scare Fair.</i>

450
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,417
<i>We are!</i>

451
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,711
<i>I hope everything</i>
<i>is going well at the B&B.</i>

452
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:56,255
<i>We miss you,</i>
<i>and we'll see you soon!</i>

453
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,382
<i>Oh! One more thing.</i>

454
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:02,219
<i>Silly us, we forgot one</i>
<i>of our magic quilts at home.</i>

455
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,472
<i>It's in the guest room</i>
<i>if you want to use it.</i>

456
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,474
<i>Bye‐bye, batkins!</i>

457
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,017
‐Magic quilt?!
‐Guest room?!

458
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:09,977
‐Oh, dear!
‐We've got trouble!

459
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,396
We need to get that magic quilt
out of the Zombiés' room

460
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:15,024
before they find it!
But how?

461
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:17,234
I have an idea!

462
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,280
Oh, uh, hello, Chef.

463
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,324
<i>Bonsoir!</i> Good evening!

464
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:27,453
May I invite you to have
a midnight snack in ze kitchen?

465
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,538
But it's, uh‐‐
It's not midnight.

466
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:33,334
It's always midnight...
somewhere!

467
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:36,295
Well, we do enjoy snacks.

468
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,423
Find the quilt!

469
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,603
Oh! Magic quilt,
magic quilt, magic quilt!

470
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:54,438
Demi, wait!
Don't unfold it!

471
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,481
Yah!

472
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,066
Too late.

473
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,734
Oh, no! Get it!

474
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,533
Huh! Whoaaa!

475
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:06,617
Uh!

476
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,160
Oh! Missed it!

477
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,161
Lemme try!

478
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,579
Uyah! Aah!

479
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,373
Ha! Solid as a rock!

480
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:14,750
Did you guys see that?
I caught it!

481
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,544
And I lost it.

482
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:18,128
Oh, I hope
you liked ze...

483
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,547
This is one batty blanket!

484
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,173
First course!

485
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,092
Let me serve you
ze next one!

486
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,392
Unh! We need to tuck it
into the bed!

487
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:32,476
Bedtime,
little blankie!

488
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,521
Oh, it's bedtime!

489
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,481
- ‐Got it.
- ‐ Got what?

490
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,359
Oh. Uh, your bed.

491
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,278
We made it nice
and comfy for you.

492
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,863
Ah! How lovely!

493
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:46,365
Good night,
Mr. and Mrs. Zombiés.

494
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,659
Good night, magic quilt.

495
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:49,702
Pardon me?

496
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,537
Oh, nothing.

497
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,372
Just something we say
as hosts at the Scare B&B!

498
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,838
Uh, good morning,
Mr. and Mrs. Zombiés!

499
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:02,548
How did you sleep?

500
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,550
We slept, uh...

501
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:09,388
‐wonderfully!
‐Phew!

502
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,931
‐Whew!
‐Yes!

503
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,766
It was that quilt!

504
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,352
It felt like it was
hugging us all night long.

505
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:18,772
It was rather...
magical!

506
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,858
You can say that again.

507
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:23,694
And being
a host at the Scare B&B

508
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,362
was pretty magical, too.

509
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,573
Thanks to
the very best helpers around.

510
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,074
‐Aww!
‐Ohh!
