1
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:20,320
(suspenseful music)

2
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:53,548
(Rachel gasps)

3
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:14,569
(siren ringing)
(Rachel screaming)

4
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:15,570
Stop.

5
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:19,272
(Rachel breathing heavily)

6
00:02:24,946 --> 00:02:27,815
(chains clanking)

7
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,820
(door banging)

8
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:37,692
What is...

9
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:42,930
(siren ringing)
(Rachel screaming)

10
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:44,497
Stop.

11
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:02,315
(chains clanking)

12
00:03:03,985 --> 00:03:05,252
What is this?

13
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:20,768
(Rachel breathing heavily)

14
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:28,543
(ominous music)

15
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,862
(Rachel gasps)

16
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:51,064
Hello?

17
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:45,484
Hello?

18
00:04:47,522 --> 00:04:48,522
Can you hear me?

19
00:04:56,864 --> 00:04:57,999
Wait a second,

20
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:02,970
Coach Roberts, Principal Bruno,

21
00:05:04,105 --> 00:05:05,105
Selena,

22
00:05:06,107 --> 00:05:07,107
Kim,

23
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:08,875
Mr. Curtis,

24
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:10,677
Jose.

25
00:05:11,746 --> 00:05:16,717
(siren ringing)
(everyone screaming)

26
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,152
Stop.

27
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:24,457
Ladies and gentlemen,

28
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,460
by this time you've been fed

29
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,765
and I'm sure you're curious
why you've been brought here

30
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:31,798
and by whom.

31
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:33,767
Allow me

32
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,370
to introduce myself,

33
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:40,541
I am the Warden and I
have gathered you all here

34
00:05:40,575 --> 00:05:43,778
to participate in a little game
called,

35
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:44,879
And then there were.

36
00:05:45,913 --> 00:05:48,883
The number will depend entirely
on you,

37
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,586
I will only say that your
survival is dependent

38
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:53,754
on what you are willing to
sacrifice.

39
00:05:54,655 --> 00:05:56,691
As with most things in life,

40
00:05:56,724 --> 00:06:00,127
there are rules, rules to
the game and like most games

41
00:06:00,161 --> 00:06:02,797
the rules are simply not in your
favor.

42
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:05,700
An audience will be watching
you.

43
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:09,570
Our society has shifted into
one built on cyber likes

44
00:06:09,604 --> 00:06:12,139
and it will be incumbent
on each of you to acquire

45
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:14,508
as many as possible to be liked.

46
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:18,880
What you must ask yourself is

47
00:06:18,913 --> 00:06:20,681
are you willing to do
whatever must be done

48
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:22,950
to acquire the most amount of
likes

49
00:06:22,984 --> 00:06:26,687
no matter what the cost
in order to survive,

50
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:27,721
in order to live?

51
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:31,424
And since we wanna include
our friends in the cyber world

52
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,561
in our little adventure,

53
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:36,797
they will vote as to which of
you will begin the first round

54
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:38,465
in our maiden voyage.

55
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,535
At this time there are
three basic directives

56
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:42,737
you must follow.

57
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,973
You cannot make any attempt
to contact the outside world

58
00:06:46,007 --> 00:06:47,508
or you will be eliminated.

59
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:52,113
You will follow and adhere
to the schedule I set for you

60
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:56,017
which includes non-refusal
of participation.

61
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,227
The person with the least likes

62
00:06:57,251 --> 00:07:00,621
at the end of the selected
time period will be eliminated.

63
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:04,158
The goal is to survive the game.

64
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,628
Should you fail to comply at any
time

65
00:07:07,662 --> 00:07:10,463
you will be immediately
eliminated.

66
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,967
(bottle thuds)

67
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:15,503
Ah,

68
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:19,006
it appears Number Six
has issues with the game.

69
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,884
Is this where I'm
supposed to beg for my life,

70
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:22,810
you fucking coward? Hm?

71
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:23,811
What is it?

72
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:25,564
You afraid to come in
here and deal with me?

73
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,724
Is that why you got to
hide behind that camera

74
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:29,750
in that fucking wall, cunt?

75
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:32,787
Number Six, for someone
who cleans for a living

76
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,089
you have a rather dirty mouth.

77
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:36,266
Can you just come in for a
second

78
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,801
let me clean the fuck out of
your mouth,

79
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:39,527
then I'll use my entire fist,

80
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,594
I'll just fuck.

81
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:41,262
There you go.

82
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:42,129
Here, dog.
- Ah.

83
00:07:42,163 --> 00:07:43,097
You like it, dog?

84
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,100
(metal clanks)

85
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,936
Are you stating that
you will not participate?

86
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,237
You speak fucking English?

87
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,872
I'm not doing nothing.

88
00:07:51,906 --> 00:07:54,041
Zero, kiss my ass.

89
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:55,676
Such language.

90
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,045
A caveat to the aforementioned
directives.

91
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,848
Each of you has an
explosive device implanted

92
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:03,851
at the base of your skull.

93
00:08:03,884 --> 00:08:07,855
Should you not participate
the device will be executed

94
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:10,524
and you will be instantly
eliminated.

95
00:08:10,558 --> 00:08:11,192
Ooh, I'm so scared.

96
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:12,593
Please don't blow me, ooh.

97
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:14,762
Ooh, yes sir help me.

98
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:17,198
Will you fuck me in the ass,
please?

99
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:21,669
Number Six, once again, are
you refusing to participate?

100
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:22,846
Is there something you wanna
say to me,

101
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,038
(metal clanking)

102
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:24,872
Huh?

103
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:25,539
Is there something you needed to
say?

104
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:27,742
No, I will not participate.

105
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:29,110
I will not participate.

106
00:08:29,143 --> 00:08:31,045
(head explosion)

107
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:32,079
(Selena screaming)

108
00:08:32,113 --> 00:08:33,981
- Help me!
- Oh my God.

109
00:08:35,116 --> 00:08:36,817
Oh no.

110
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:37,618
Oh no.

111
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:39,987
Number Eight, I strongly suggest

112
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:42,323
you stop tampering with your
device.

113
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:43,724
I can figure this out.

114
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:47,261
I can...

115
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:48,796
I can find a way out.

116
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:50,297
I just...

117
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:52,033
I know what this is.

118
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:55,236
It's like one of those...

119
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:57,838
It's like on of those escape
rooms, right?

120
00:08:57,872 --> 00:09:00,875
You just need to...

121
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:03,310
You just need to find the hidden
clue.

122
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:06,613
Secret numbers to-

123
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:08,315
[Warden] Eight.

124
00:09:08,349 --> 00:09:09,417
To release these bounds.

125
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,186
The only mathematics
that can save you this time

126
00:09:13,154 --> 00:09:15,990
would be the amount of
likes you'll receive.

127
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:16,857
Like?

128
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:18,726
What do you mean likes?

129
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,761
What kind of likes like?

130
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:25,032
I don't have any friends, nobody
likes me.

131
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:26,033
Like this,

132
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:27,735
it's just a matter of time.

133
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:29,770
I can figure this out myself.

134
00:09:29,804 --> 00:09:30,805
I'll do this myself.

135
00:09:32,273 --> 00:09:34,075
I've almost got it.

136
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:35,108
Ooh.

137
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:39,046
You're going to get it all
right.

138
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:42,950
Almost.

139
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:45,619
(Mr. Curtis laughing)

140
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:48,622
(head explosion)

141
00:09:48,656 --> 00:09:50,124
(Rachel gasps)

142
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:51,358
So, there we have it.

143
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:56,097
Remove the collar and the device
automatically ejects itself

144
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,199
in fairly nasty fashion.

145
00:09:58,232 --> 00:10:01,068
So two down, six to go.

146
00:10:01,102 --> 00:10:02,203
Well, six already went

147
00:10:02,236 --> 00:10:03,838
but you know what I mean.

148
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,677
The real game will begin
momentarily,

149
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:11,444
stay tuned.

150
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:15,049
(gentle music)

151
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,290
(Rachel sighs)

152
00:10:23,324 --> 00:10:26,193
(chains clanking)

153
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:31,966
(suspenseful music)

154
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:33,568
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

155
00:10:33,602 --> 00:10:35,069
What's this about a website?

156
00:10:36,337 --> 00:10:38,205
Is this some kind of a joke?

157
00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:40,141
People in cells?

158
00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:41,942
What do you mean people in
cells?

159
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:44,445
No, this is not being
downloaded from here.

160
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,156
We don't do things like
that to our prisoners,

161
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,382
I don't care what you see on TV.

162
00:10:48,415 --> 00:10:51,318
People, what the
hell's going on in here?

163
00:10:51,352 --> 00:10:52,953
Did a bomb go off or something?

164
00:10:52,987 --> 00:10:54,455
Yeah, something like that,
Captain.

165
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:57,324
I'm getting reports that
some guys head just exploded

166
00:10:57,358 --> 00:10:58,459
on the internet.

167
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,337
Oh my God, the internet,
it's always the internet.

168
00:11:00,361 --> 00:11:03,397
Every time I go online
my head wants to explode.

169
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,266
This is supposed to
be somebody's real head

170
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:07,701
and somebody else got
shot through the eye.

171
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:09,303
Now this is supposed to be a
live feed.

172
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,906
Being run by someone who's
calling himself, the Warden.

173
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:12,939
Exactly.

174
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:15,442
It's some game or something.

175
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:20,190
[Connor] People are actually
watching this garbage.

176
00:11:20,214 --> 00:11:21,358
[Malone] This has got to be a
prank,

177
00:11:21,382 --> 00:11:22,783
doesn't it, Casey?

178
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:24,094
[Conner] What are those numbers?

179
00:11:24,118 --> 00:11:25,085
[Tanner] Likes.

180
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:27,188
We've got sickos out
there liking this shit?

181
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:29,857
Oh, you would understand
that, wouldn't you Conner?

182
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,125
(Casey chuckles)

183
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:32,826
That's what you do all day.

184
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,028
(Casey chuckles)

185
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:35,805
Well, we're not the ones
calling the station, detective.

186
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:37,073
Well, why don't you
calm everyone's nerves

187
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,333
and tell them that you're not on
the case,

188
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,936
you're not on it officially, all
right?

189
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:42,903
[Malone] What a Dick.

190
00:11:42,937 --> 00:11:43,605
(everyone laughing)

191
00:11:43,638 --> 00:11:44,681
That's what I'm paid to do.

192
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,740
[Captain Oliver] Casey,
Tanner in my office now.

193
00:11:46,774 --> 00:11:47,408
Okay, okay.

194
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:48,742
Gonna finish that banana?

195
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:49,776
Here.

196
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:51,444
Go on.

197
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,147
(Malone laughs)

198
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,381
[Malone] Good luck.

199
00:11:54,415 --> 00:11:55,382
[Captain Oliver] I want you
two guys on this right away.

200
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:58,285
Captain, I think the
whole thing is a hoax.

201
00:11:58,319 --> 00:11:59,220
Yeah, I don't know.

202
00:11:59,253 --> 00:12:00,221
The site's encrypted,

203
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:02,923
which means it's gonna
be really hard to trace.

204
00:12:02,957 --> 00:12:05,025
This Warden guy is pretty smart.

205
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:07,194
I mean, he's got this out
where everybody can see it

206
00:12:07,228 --> 00:12:10,030
but he really does not wanna be
located.

207
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:10,898
What makes him so different

208
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:12,900
from anybody else we're chasing
around?

209
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:14,444
I mean what the fuck, it
doesn't make him special.

210
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:16,170
I hear what you're saying, I do.

211
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:19,273
We have to get this guy and we
have to shut down this site.

212
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:20,808
You know what would be good?

213
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:22,510
Is if we did it today.

214
00:12:22,544 --> 00:12:24,120
I'm just getting too old for
this shit.

215
00:12:24,144 --> 00:12:25,846
I honestly...

216
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:26,814
What am I doing here?

217
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:28,550
It's connected to
the missing person case

218
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:29,759
you guys have been working on.

219
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:34,121
Phillips and Mitchell got a
positive ID from this site.

220
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:35,322
We got to do something.

221
00:12:35,356 --> 00:12:36,534
So you're saying that she's
involved like voluntarily,

222
00:12:36,558 --> 00:12:37,224
she wants to be part it?

223
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:38,335
Okay, this is gonna be hard,

224
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:42,162
I know I'm your boss but
you guys are the detectives.

225
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:45,199
So why don't you go out
there and get it done.

226
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:47,067
The Warden.

227
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:48,369
Let's go get The Warden.

228
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:50,271
(everyone laughing)

229
00:12:50,304 --> 00:12:52,106
Okay, all right Captain.

230
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:52,773
All right, get out.

231
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:54,208
Come on, let's get this guy.

232
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,812
(Selena sobs)

233
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:03,082
Hello?

234
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:06,554
(chains clanking)

235
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,961
Selena, is that you?

236
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:15,530
Who's there?

237
00:13:15,563 --> 00:13:16,930
It's Rachel.

238
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:18,132
Come over to the vent,

239
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:19,333
the one across from you.

240
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:21,935
Rachel?

241
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:25,439
(Selena breathing heavily)

242
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:29,476
(Selena sobs)

243
00:13:29,511 --> 00:13:30,511
Rachel,

244
00:13:32,313 --> 00:13:35,449
I thought that was you on the
monitor.

245
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,160
Are you alone in there too?

246
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:47,193
Yes.

247
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:50,264
Do you know how we got here?

248
00:13:52,634 --> 00:13:53,967
No, I don't.

249
00:13:57,672 --> 00:13:59,973
Are you all right?

250
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:01,275
You hurt?

251
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:03,043
I'm okay.

252
00:14:03,077 --> 00:14:05,179
I'm chained.

253
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:06,212
Yeah, me too.

254
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:09,551
I think we all are.

255
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:13,387
What the hell is going on, huh?

256
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:19,360
I'm just an English teacher.

257
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:24,932
I didn't do anything to deserve
this.

258
00:14:27,101 --> 00:14:29,169
Neither did I or the janitor.

259
00:14:30,104 --> 00:14:32,640
(siren ringing)

260
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:36,008
Please.

261
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:40,214
[Warden] The game is about to
begin.

262
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:43,183
Please place yourself
directly before your monitor.

263
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:45,052
We better do as we're told.

264
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:46,420
We'll talk later.

265
00:14:48,422 --> 00:14:49,923
[Warden] You have 10 seconds

266
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:52,025
or you will be eliminated.

267
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,027
(timer ticking)

268
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:55,061
Fuck you.

269
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:57,197
We'll just see about that.

270
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:59,032
[Warden] You have
five seconds to comply.

271
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:01,068
(door banging)
(Kim screaming)

272
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,637
[Kim] What the fuck?

273
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,638
It amazes me

274
00:15:03,671 --> 00:15:05,673
how people can't follow
simple rules nowadays.

275
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:07,441
(Kim groaning)

276
00:15:07,474 --> 00:15:10,210
(Kim screaming)

277
00:15:12,446 --> 00:15:17,451
Once again, failure to comply
means immediate elimination.

278
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:20,454
(Kim screaming)

279
00:15:21,623 --> 00:15:23,691
Being a gym teacher, Number
Seven,

280
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:28,929
I assumed you remember warm
up, stretch before exercising.

281
00:15:29,731 --> 00:15:31,965
Now let's see how limber you
really are.

282
00:15:33,635 --> 00:15:36,370
(Kim screaming)

283
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,978
You bastard.

284
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:47,549
(Kim screaming)

285
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:53,053
(Kim gurgling)

286
00:16:12,206 --> 00:16:15,275
(ominous music)

287
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:16,309
Oh.

288
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:21,348
That poor woman, bless her soul.

289
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:26,487
(hand snaps)

290
00:16:30,725 --> 00:16:33,393
(gentle music)

291
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,097
And with that we bid fair adieu

292
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,533
to one lucky Number Seven.

293
00:16:40,234 --> 00:16:44,606
At this rate this game
may become very short.

294
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,408
(The Warden clicks his tongue)

295
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:49,276
Shit.

296
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:50,410
He killed another one.

297
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:51,278
(Casey laughs)

298
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:53,313
I think so, that looked real
to me.

299
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:55,349
That looked fucking real, wow.

300
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:56,718
You better get this guy.

301
00:16:56,751 --> 00:16:57,719
What do you think we're trying
to do?

302
00:16:57,752 --> 00:17:00,454
I mean look, this guy's
using these splitters

303
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:01,756
and relays and so what it does

304
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:03,457
it bounces a signal all around
the world,

305
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,192
that's gonna be really hard to
catch.

306
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:06,369
Listen, we gotta get this
motherfucker,

307
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:08,262
it's no joke anymore.

308
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:10,230
I thought it was a joke before,
maybe.

309
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:12,534
I'm gonna get him.

310
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:13,433
My uncle.

311
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:14,101
Hey, yey, yey, yey.

312
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:15,003
You can't just come in here.

313
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:17,304
Hey, I don't care who your
uncle is,

314
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:18,716
I don't care if he's the
president of the United States,

315
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,641
you can't-

316
00:17:19,674 --> 00:17:20,508
You don't get it.

317
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:21,375
You can't just force-

318
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:22,452
I just watched my uncle die
online.

319
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:24,153
- All right, I understand.
- Everyone, I got it.

320
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:25,112
Someone blew his fucking head
off.

321
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:26,289
Come on, I got it. I got it.

322
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:27,281
I got it. I got it.
- I understand.

323
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:29,149
- I got it. I got it.
- [Malone] All right.

324
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:29,851
Give me a second here.

325
00:17:29,884 --> 00:17:30,884
I got it.

326
00:17:35,523 --> 00:17:36,558
Nobody's against you.

327
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:39,326
Now, who's your uncle?

328
00:17:40,762 --> 00:17:43,497
Jose Mendez, went missing last
night.

329
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:46,199
Thought I just had too much to
drink,

330
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:47,410
then I see him on this website.

331
00:17:47,434 --> 00:17:49,303
What the hell is he doing on a
website?

332
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:51,539
I just know his fucking head
blew off.

333
00:17:51,573 --> 00:17:52,573
You saw that?

334
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:54,341
Oh yeah.

335
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:57,579
Listen pal, he's my
partner, Eddie Malone.

336
00:17:57,612 --> 00:17:59,479
You go ahead and give him a
statement.

337
00:17:59,514 --> 00:18:00,791
I wanna know all about your
uncle

338
00:18:00,815 --> 00:18:02,316
and everything that's going on.

339
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:03,651
All right, we'll go from there.

340
00:18:03,685 --> 00:18:04,519
Okay?

341
00:18:04,552 --> 00:18:06,186
Do you trust me?

342
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:07,021
Yeah.

343
00:18:07,055 --> 00:18:08,197
All right, I got you back, okay?

344
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:10,725
Please, you got to find him.

345
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:11,826
Oh, I will.

346
00:18:12,927 --> 00:18:13,761
I will, go ahead.

347
00:18:13,795 --> 00:18:14,796
[Eddie] Come on.

348
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:16,598
I'll take your statement.

349
00:18:16,631 --> 00:18:18,231
Thanks, Casey.

350
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:19,843
You really think it wasn't
real, right?

351
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:21,168
I hope not.

352
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:22,737
Just CGI or some trick.

353
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,639
It's a joke or something stupid.

354
00:18:24,672 --> 00:18:25,873
We'll find out.

355
00:18:25,907 --> 00:18:26,907
I promise you that.

356
00:18:28,676 --> 00:18:29,676
Take it easy.

357
00:18:32,747 --> 00:18:35,349
(people chattering)

358
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:37,451
(phone ringing)

359
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:38,886
What do you make of that, man?

360
00:18:39,887 --> 00:18:42,389
Oh, that's...

361
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:43,658
That's rough.

362
00:18:43,691 --> 00:18:44,626
We got to do it, man.

363
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:45,627
We got to go.

364
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,763
I think that I might
be able to find this guy

365
00:18:48,796 --> 00:18:51,799
if we can find one of
the stronger signals.

366
00:18:53,668 --> 00:18:54,936
Yeah, okay.

367
00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:56,269
So what does that mean?

368
00:18:57,371 --> 00:18:58,171
Road trip.

369
00:18:58,205 --> 00:18:59,205
Okay.

370
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:02,209
So you're driving.

371
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:03,410
(Tanner chuckles)

372
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:04,244
(buzzer ringing)

373
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:07,381
Okay, let's get this game
started

374
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:09,383
before there aren't any players
left.

375
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:11,629
The audience will choose which
one of you

376
00:19:11,653 --> 00:19:13,453
will initiate the proceedings.

377
00:19:18,793 --> 00:19:19,894
Number Three,

378
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:23,665
go to your trunk and pick
the object of your choice.

379
00:19:24,866 --> 00:19:28,803
You have 15 seconds to comply
or you will be eliminated.

380
00:19:29,737 --> 00:19:32,472
(ominous music)

381
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:35,677
10.

382
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,546
(Rachel groans)

383
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:39,579
Six.

384
00:19:41,582 --> 00:19:42,817
Return to the monitor.

385
00:19:47,021 --> 00:19:48,455
Ah,

386
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:49,891
excellent choice.

387
00:19:50,892 --> 00:19:52,225
Now,

388
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:53,260
extend the blade.

389
00:19:53,961 --> 00:19:56,698
(ominous music)

390
00:20:00,735 --> 00:20:02,537
Extend the blade, final warning.

391
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:06,841
Now,

392
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:08,810
place it beneath your right
thumbnail.

393
00:20:11,846 --> 00:20:13,648
Right thumbnail, final warning.

394
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,385
(ominous music)

395
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:19,453
Remove your nail.

396
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:26,493
Remove

397
00:20:26,527 --> 00:20:27,527
your nail.

398
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:41,542
(Rachel screaming)

399
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:43,443
Enough.

400
00:20:43,477 --> 00:20:44,311
I've had enough.

401
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:46,948
I don't know who is doing this
or why

402
00:20:46,981 --> 00:20:48,916
but as head of the board of
education

403
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,619
I strongly object to
what is going on here.

404
00:20:51,652 --> 00:20:54,856
School is no longer
in session, Number One.

405
00:20:54,889 --> 00:20:56,791
You don't make the rules here

406
00:20:56,824 --> 00:20:59,326
and you're in no position to
give orders,

407
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:00,460
do you understand?

408
00:21:01,996 --> 00:21:03,664
Same goes for you, Number Four.

409
00:21:06,801 --> 00:21:09,670
(Rachel groaning)

410
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:13,841
(Warden sighs)

411
00:21:17,512 --> 00:21:20,447
(Rachel screaming)

412
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:26,521
So what?

413
00:21:26,554 --> 00:21:27,822
A broken nail.

414
00:21:28,856 --> 00:21:30,490
I've seen worse.

415
00:21:30,525 --> 00:21:33,861
[Warden] From now on you
must obtain the most likes

416
00:21:33,895 --> 00:21:35,362
or you will be eliminated.

417
00:21:37,698 --> 00:21:38,933
What the fuck?

418
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:42,503
[Warden] Round one, completed.

419
00:21:42,537 --> 00:21:45,540
(static interference)

420
00:21:45,573 --> 00:21:47,041
Football is a game.

421
00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:49,076
Baseball is a game.

422
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,078
This is a shits how.

423
00:21:52,513 --> 00:21:53,848
Where's the sportsmanship?

424
00:21:55,149 --> 00:21:56,083
The skill?

425
00:21:56,117 --> 00:21:58,019
It's a game, where's the skill?

426
00:21:58,052 --> 00:22:00,688
This is violence for the sake of
violence.

427
00:22:00,721 --> 00:22:03,991
You think some sicko is
gonna get off watching this?

428
00:22:05,593 --> 00:22:06,426
(Roberts chuckles)

429
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:09,063
(dramatic music)

430
00:22:10,898 --> 00:22:13,935
And the internet today
has created quite the buzz

431
00:22:13,968 --> 00:22:15,903
with a new website that has
emerged

432
00:22:15,937 --> 00:22:17,071
that has everyone talking.

433
00:22:17,104 --> 00:22:18,139
(static interference)

434
00:22:18,172 --> 00:22:20,808
A sinister force that
calls himself the Warden,

435
00:22:20,842 --> 00:22:22,844
claims to have eight
unwilling participants

436
00:22:22,877 --> 00:22:24,879
playing a twisted game on the
internet.

437
00:22:24,912 --> 00:22:28,149
It's unknown at this time
if this is a real big hoax

438
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:31,519
or people are actually
watching real life murders.

439
00:22:31,552 --> 00:22:34,522
Films like Saw and
Hostile have now led the way

440
00:22:34,555 --> 00:22:38,860
to a website capitalizing on
this brand of quote unquote

441
00:22:38,893 --> 00:22:39,794
"Entertainment."

442
00:22:39,827 --> 00:22:40,661
(static interference )

443
00:22:40,695 --> 00:22:41,696
People are watching

444
00:22:41,729 --> 00:22:44,031
and the numbers are
increasing by the minute.

445
00:22:44,065 --> 00:22:44,999
(static interference)

446
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:46,243
Authorities are currently
investigating

447
00:22:46,267 --> 00:22:50,571
this illegal dark website to
see if this is fact or fiction.

448
00:22:50,605 --> 00:22:53,473
Warning, this site is
not for the squeamish,

449
00:22:53,507 --> 00:22:55,142
viewer discretion is advised.

450
00:22:55,176 --> 00:22:58,512
(static interference)

451
00:23:01,215 --> 00:23:04,085
(Rachel groaning)

452
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:18,766
(Rachel groaning)

453
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,468
(Rachel sighs)

454
00:23:27,575 --> 00:23:29,176
[John] Rachel, are you all
right?

455
00:23:31,612 --> 00:23:32,880
It hurts.

456
00:23:32,914 --> 00:23:34,181
Can you wrap it?

457
00:23:34,215 --> 00:23:35,149
[Rachel] I did.

458
00:23:35,182 --> 00:23:36,182
Good.

459
00:23:46,027 --> 00:23:47,795
Who is this Warden guy?

460
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,198
I don't know but we
better figure something out

461
00:23:51,232 --> 00:23:53,100
before it gets any worse.

462
00:23:53,134 --> 00:23:55,670
Three people are already dead.

463
00:23:55,703 --> 00:23:57,571
How much worse can it get?

464
00:23:57,605 --> 00:24:01,175
Well, if Mr. Curtis were still
with us

465
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:03,978
he'd probably say, "Three
times two times worse."

466
00:24:05,613 --> 00:24:06,613
Jesus,

467
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:09,817
why did this guy pick my school?

468
00:24:10,985 --> 00:24:14,889
Did we flunk some psychopath
recently?

469
00:24:14,922 --> 00:24:17,658
This isn't the work of
a disgruntled student.

470
00:24:17,692 --> 00:24:18,692
No,

471
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:20,293
this...

472
00:24:21,595 --> 00:24:22,663
This is personal.

473
00:24:24,031 --> 00:24:25,800
Someone's idea of revenge.

474
00:24:26,734 --> 00:24:28,502
Well revenge or not,

475
00:24:28,536 --> 00:24:30,705
we'd better get these things
out the back of our necks

476
00:24:30,738 --> 00:24:33,941
before we wind up like Jose or
Curtis.

477
00:24:33,975 --> 00:24:34,975
Okay.

478
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,511
What do you have in mind?

479
00:24:37,545 --> 00:24:38,713
I don't know, Rachel,

480
00:24:38,746 --> 00:24:39,790
you're the science teacher.

481
00:24:39,814 --> 00:24:41,682
Don't you know about anatomy?

482
00:24:41,716 --> 00:24:42,716
Think of something.

483
00:24:43,818 --> 00:24:45,019
This is a game.

484
00:24:45,052 --> 00:24:49,056
Every game I've ever played has
a rule book, whatever it is.

485
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,158
Roberts, can you hear us?

486
00:24:51,192 --> 00:24:52,159
Yeah.

487
00:24:52,193 --> 00:24:53,904
He's got the mics on,
we can hear each other.

488
00:24:53,928 --> 00:24:55,062
(chain clanking)

489
00:24:55,096 --> 00:24:58,566
Look, the Warden wants us
to follow his every command,

490
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:03,104
he thinks he's the judge and
the jury and the executioner.

491
00:25:03,137 --> 00:25:06,207
It's up to us to find a
way out of this thing.

492
00:25:07,108 --> 00:25:09,043
You hear me, Ms. Phillips?

493
00:25:09,076 --> 00:25:10,077
I guess so.

494
00:25:10,111 --> 00:25:11,779
We got to stay calm.

495
00:25:12,646 --> 00:25:13,948
You hear me, Selena?

496
00:25:14,982 --> 00:25:15,616
No, no, no.

497
00:25:15,649 --> 00:25:17,318
He's right, keep your wits.

498
00:25:17,351 --> 00:25:18,152
We'll get through.

499
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:23,591
(siren ringing)
(everyone screaming)

500
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:26,160
[Warden] Stand before your
monitors and wait instructions.

501
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:27,928
You have 10 seconds to comply.

502
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,331
All right, here we go.

503
00:25:30,364 --> 00:25:31,799
Be strong.

504
00:25:33,267 --> 00:25:36,137
(chains clanking)

505
00:25:40,674 --> 00:25:42,152
[Warden] You will have
one minute to choose

506
00:25:42,176 --> 00:25:44,712
what task you will perform for
the camera

507
00:25:44,745 --> 00:25:47,748
in order to be most liked by our
audience.

508
00:25:47,782 --> 00:25:49,717
You may choose any item at your
disposal.

509
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,218
What does that mean?

510
00:25:51,252 --> 00:25:53,687
[Warden] The individual with
the least likes that deadline

511
00:25:53,721 --> 00:25:55,156
will be of course eliminated.

512
00:25:55,189 --> 00:25:56,957
This is horseshit.

513
00:25:56,991 --> 00:25:58,325
Get your ass in here.

514
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,627
Me and you

515
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,795
unless you're a pussy.

516
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:02,929
[Warden] Begin.

517
00:26:03,764 --> 00:26:04,999
(ominous music)

518
00:26:05,032 --> 00:26:06,967
I don't understand any of this.

519
00:26:07,001 --> 00:26:08,702
I don't belong here.

520
00:26:08,736 --> 00:26:11,005
I didn't do anything wrong.

521
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:12,606
This is pointless.

522
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,374
Utterly pointless.

523
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:15,609
(chains clanking)

524
00:26:15,643 --> 00:26:18,179
(timer ticking)

525
00:26:23,084 --> 00:26:25,886
Look, I work, I go home.

526
00:26:27,288 --> 00:26:28,122
What?

527
00:26:28,155 --> 00:26:29,123
No baseball bats.

528
00:26:29,156 --> 00:26:31,659
Just do my job and I'm
really go good at it.

529
00:26:33,394 --> 00:26:34,995
[Warden] You have 30 seconds.

530
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:36,363
(Selena screams)

531
00:26:36,397 --> 00:26:38,699
(timer ticking)

532
00:26:38,732 --> 00:26:40,034
You have 25 seconds.

533
00:26:40,067 --> 00:26:41,936
What am I supposed to do with
this shit?

534
00:26:41,969 --> 00:26:45,272
I'm not gonna put up with
this insanity any longer.

535
00:26:45,306 --> 00:26:47,108
I'm warning you.

536
00:26:47,141 --> 00:26:48,742
I need more time.

537
00:26:48,776 --> 00:26:49,777
Fuck.

538
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:50,644
Fuck.

539
00:26:50,678 --> 00:26:51,812
Please.

540
00:26:51,846 --> 00:26:55,149
(Selena wailing)

541
00:26:55,182 --> 00:26:56,283
- [Warden] Nine-
- Fuck.

542
00:26:56,317 --> 00:26:58,052
[Warden] Eight, seven.

543
00:26:58,085 --> 00:26:59,120
Fuck.

544
00:26:59,153 --> 00:27:01,088
[Warden] Five, four,

545
00:27:01,122 --> 00:27:02,256
two.

546
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:03,257
Wait.

547
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,125
[Warden] One.

548
00:27:04,158 --> 00:27:04,992
Wait, wait, wait.

549
00:27:05,025 --> 00:27:05,659
(buzzer buzzing)

550
00:27:05,693 --> 00:27:06,927
[Warden] Your time is up.

551
00:27:07,795 --> 00:27:08,696
Now,

552
00:27:08,729 --> 00:27:11,165
what do you want me to do with
this shit?

553
00:27:11,198 --> 00:27:14,268
You will now each perform
a non-suicidal self injury

554
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:17,304
with the instrument you have
chosen for our audience.

555
00:27:17,338 --> 00:27:19,840
You have 10 seconds to complete
this task

556
00:27:19,874 --> 00:27:21,842
or you will be eliminated.

557
00:27:21,876 --> 00:27:22,877
We will begin with

558
00:27:24,211 --> 00:27:25,880
five.

559
00:27:25,913 --> 00:27:26,714
What?

560
00:27:26,747 --> 00:27:28,349
[Warden] Begin or be eliminated.

561
00:27:28,382 --> 00:27:31,118
Injure yourself with the
instrument you've chosen.

562
00:27:31,152 --> 00:27:32,253
Wait.

563
00:27:32,286 --> 00:27:34,326
[Warden] You have 10
seconds to perform your task.

564
00:27:34,355 --> 00:27:35,956
10, nine,

565
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:36,824
(Selena wailing)

566
00:27:36,857 --> 00:27:37,559
Eight.

567
00:27:37,592 --> 00:27:38,392
- I can't.
- [Warden] Seven.

568
00:27:38,425 --> 00:27:39,293
I'll do anything you want
please.

569
00:27:39,326 --> 00:27:41,162
- [Warden] Six, five, four.
- Please.

570
00:27:41,195 --> 00:27:43,330
[Warden] Three, two.

571
00:27:43,364 --> 00:27:48,369
(Selena screaming)
(ominous music)

572
00:27:50,104 --> 00:27:52,806
We will now move on to Four.

573
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:56,043
You have 10 seconds to perform
your task.

574
00:27:56,911 --> 00:27:59,380
10, nine, eight.

575
00:27:59,413 --> 00:28:00,423
What are you waiting for?

576
00:28:00,447 --> 00:28:01,348
[Warden] Six.

577
00:28:01,382 --> 00:28:02,049
He's gonna kill you if you
don't do it.

578
00:28:02,082 --> 00:28:03,284
[Warden] Five, four, three.

579
00:28:03,317 --> 00:28:06,754
You'll never get away with
this you sick son of a bitch.

580
00:28:06,787 --> 00:28:09,323
(ominous music)

581
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,960
Fuck you.

582
00:28:15,763 --> 00:28:17,097
Way to go, Bruno.

583
00:28:17,131 --> 00:28:18,199
Way to go.

584
00:28:18,232 --> 00:28:20,067
[Warden] We will now move on
to two.

585
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,235
Two?

586
00:28:21,268 --> 00:28:22,303
What about three?

587
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,471
Three's next.

588
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:26,149
[Warden] You have 10
seconds to perform your task.

589
00:28:26,173 --> 00:28:27,474
You're the numbers guy.

590
00:28:27,509 --> 00:28:28,409
- [Warden] 10.
- Can't you even count?

591
00:28:28,442 --> 00:28:32,980
[Warden] Nine, eight, seven,
six, five,

592
00:28:33,013 --> 00:28:35,749
four, three, two.

593
00:28:35,783 --> 00:28:36,450
You fuck.

594
00:28:36,483 --> 00:28:38,819
(door banging)

595
00:28:38,852 --> 00:28:39,852
Fuck you.

596
00:28:46,093 --> 00:28:49,029
(Roberts groaning)

597
00:28:49,964 --> 00:28:50,965
Fuck is this?

598
00:28:50,998 --> 00:28:52,366
Let this be a lesson.

599
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,401
You will not be warned again.

600
00:28:54,435 --> 00:28:55,769
Burn.

601
00:28:55,803 --> 00:28:56,971
(Roberts groaning)

602
00:28:57,004 --> 00:28:59,340
If you don't follow the
rules you will be eliminated.

603
00:29:00,508 --> 00:29:02,409
Now, let's go to Number Three.

604
00:29:03,444 --> 00:29:06,514
You have 10 seconds to perform
your task.

605
00:29:06,548 --> 00:29:11,752
10, nine, eight, seven, six,
five.

606
00:29:12,186 --> 00:29:13,020
Come on Rachel,

607
00:29:13,053 --> 00:29:13,688
you can do it.

608
00:29:13,722 --> 00:29:15,289
[Warden] Four, three, two.

609
00:29:16,357 --> 00:29:19,226
(Rachel groaning)

610
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:22,929
Oh.

611
00:29:25,065 --> 00:29:25,700
Now,

612
00:29:25,734 --> 00:29:27,401
let's move on to Number One.

613
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,303
No, no, I won't do it.

614
00:29:29,336 --> 00:29:30,904
I won't.

615
00:29:30,938 --> 00:29:31,839
10.

616
00:29:31,872 --> 00:29:32,707
No, I'm a role model in this
community.

617
00:29:32,741 --> 00:29:35,309
Eight, seven, six, five, four,
three.

618
00:29:35,342 --> 00:29:37,278
I will not participate
in this sick twisted

619
00:29:37,311 --> 00:29:38,312
little game of yours.

620
00:29:38,345 --> 00:29:39,313
Three, two.

621
00:29:39,346 --> 00:29:44,351
Oh God.
(Man groaning)

622
00:29:50,891 --> 00:29:52,393
And now the voting begins.

623
00:29:52,426 --> 00:29:56,330
Our audience will choose which
of you will be liked most.

624
00:30:01,168 --> 00:30:03,203
I guess people like surprises.

625
00:30:03,237 --> 00:30:04,805
One is the most liked.

626
00:30:06,106 --> 00:30:08,576
Five, you're eliminated.

627
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,277
What?

628
00:30:10,311 --> 00:30:11,145
No.

629
00:30:11,178 --> 00:30:12,246
I'll do something else.

630
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:13,113
I'll do...

631
00:30:13,147 --> 00:30:14,315
I'll do whatever you want,

632
00:30:14,348 --> 00:30:15,949
please just please.
(Selena wailing)

633
00:30:15,983 --> 00:30:17,184
I'll do something else.

634
00:30:17,217 --> 00:30:20,087
(Selena mumbling)

635
00:30:23,591 --> 00:30:25,527
Rachel, help me please.

636
00:30:26,594 --> 00:30:28,028
Please let me out.

637
00:30:28,062 --> 00:30:30,864
(Selena wailing)

638
00:30:46,413 --> 00:30:49,149
(Selena screaming)

639
00:30:49,183 --> 00:30:50,552
Now we're cooking with gas.

640
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,056
(Selena screaming)

641
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:02,196
(Selena screaming)

642
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:05,325
(gentle music)

643
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,575
Fuck.

644
00:32:20,608 --> 00:32:21,442
What?

645
00:32:21,475 --> 00:32:22,510
Killed another one.

646
00:32:22,544 --> 00:32:23,611
Okay now listen,

647
00:32:23,645 --> 00:32:26,113
I don't wanna waste a bunch
of gas driving around.

648
00:32:26,146 --> 00:32:27,080
We're getting closer, brother.

649
00:32:27,114 --> 00:32:28,182
We're getting closer.

650
00:32:28,215 --> 00:32:29,483
How do you do that stuff?

651
00:32:29,517 --> 00:32:30,628
Uh, you don't want to know.

652
00:32:30,652 --> 00:32:31,985
I wanna get that cock sucker.

653
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:32,687
We'll get him.

654
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,489
Yeah, Seesaw 69, the remake,

655
00:32:35,523 --> 00:32:36,356
(Tanner chuckles)

656
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,625
Starring The Warden.

657
00:32:37,659 --> 00:32:39,561
[Casey] Remember Gary Ridge way?

658
00:32:39,594 --> 00:32:40,427
Serial killer.

659
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:41,295
Yeah, yeah.

660
00:32:41,328 --> 00:32:42,296
Yeah.

661
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:43,163
49 women he killed?

662
00:32:43,197 --> 00:32:44,131
Yeah, yeah.

663
00:32:44,164 --> 00:32:45,132
He used to go back and visit
his victims

664
00:32:45,165 --> 00:32:48,536
and they asked him why
he would go back to them

665
00:32:49,403 --> 00:32:50,481
and he said, "Well, you know,

666
00:32:50,505 --> 00:32:53,775
it's too expensive to find a new
one,

667
00:32:53,808 --> 00:32:56,176
we're spending a fortune on
gas."

668
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,579
(Tanner laughs)

669
00:32:57,612 --> 00:32:59,179
I spend a lot of money on gas.

670
00:32:59,213 --> 00:33:00,256
You got to be kidding me.

671
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,448
(both laughing)
- No, he...

672
00:33:01,482 --> 00:33:03,150
He actually said that.

673
00:33:03,183 --> 00:33:05,419
(both laughing)

674
00:33:05,452 --> 00:33:07,020
[Captain Oliver] Casey, Tanner.

675
00:33:07,054 --> 00:33:08,322
Yeah.

676
00:33:08,355 --> 00:33:09,767
[Captain Oliver] We
just received a call.

677
00:33:09,791 --> 00:33:12,493
Someone identified that last
victim.

678
00:33:12,527 --> 00:33:14,328
Her name is Selena Marshall,

679
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:15,295
she's a local.

680
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:16,664
Teaches at Wootton High.

681
00:33:16,698 --> 00:33:19,567
Also went missing yesterday,
it wasn't reported.

682
00:33:19,601 --> 00:33:21,335
Okay, we're almost there.

683
00:33:21,368 --> 00:33:22,580
[Captain Oliver] Someone
also thinks they saw

684
00:33:22,604 --> 00:33:24,404
Coach Roberts on the site.

685
00:33:24,438 --> 00:33:26,306
He also teaches a Wootton.

686
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,308
So I guess this shit just got
real.

687
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,210
Shit.

688
00:33:33,781 --> 00:33:36,651
(Rachel groaning)

689
00:33:49,496 --> 00:33:51,198
[Bruno] Rachel, are you there?

690
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,600
Can you hear me?

691
00:33:54,769 --> 00:33:56,671
I'm sorry about Selena.

692
00:33:56,704 --> 00:33:58,272
She was a good...

693
00:33:58,305 --> 00:33:59,373
She was a good person.

694
00:33:59,406 --> 00:34:01,141
A lot of good that does her now.

695
00:34:03,176 --> 00:34:04,746
A lot of good that does any of
us.

696
00:34:05,847 --> 00:34:07,815
Without a gas mask
there's no scientific way

697
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:10,718
to survive mustard gas
poisoning.

698
00:34:10,752 --> 00:34:12,419
That's what that was?

699
00:34:12,452 --> 00:34:14,421
Pretty sure, judging by her
reaction.

700
00:34:16,189 --> 00:34:18,225
It's a hell of a way to go.

701
00:34:18,258 --> 00:34:19,326
She will be missed.

702
00:34:20,862 --> 00:34:23,463
Unlike another teacher
who was recently let go.

703
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:26,668
[Bruno] Why bring her up now?

704
00:34:29,804 --> 00:34:31,515
Have you noticed the
music that's been playing

705
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:33,307
after each one of us dies?

706
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,174
How could you not?

707
00:34:34,207 --> 00:34:35,275
It's annoying as hell.

708
00:34:36,443 --> 00:34:39,614
It's an old nursery rhyme
called, 10 Little Indians.

709
00:34:39,647 --> 00:34:41,381
That's just a coincidence.

710
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:43,483
You sure about that?

711
00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:45,720
[Roberts] Hey,

712
00:34:45,753 --> 00:34:47,454
what are you two talking about
in there?

713
00:34:47,487 --> 00:34:50,525
Hold on a second,
somebody's on the other side.

714
00:34:50,558 --> 00:34:52,492
Roberts, is that you?

715
00:34:52,527 --> 00:34:53,493
[Roberts] Yeah.

716
00:34:53,528 --> 00:34:54,361
(Roberts chuckles)

717
00:34:54,394 --> 00:34:55,563
What's left of me.

718
00:34:55,597 --> 00:34:56,731
How's your face, pal?

719
00:34:57,765 --> 00:34:59,366
It hurts like a mother.

720
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:00,602
(Roberts heavily breathing)

721
00:35:00,635 --> 00:35:02,637
I'm gonna kill that son of a
bitch.

722
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:05,205
Yeah, if he doesn't kill us
first.

723
00:35:05,238 --> 00:35:06,541
Listen, I have a plan.

724
00:35:06,574 --> 00:35:08,241
Great, what is it?

725
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:09,644
(Roberts heavily breathing)

726
00:35:09,677 --> 00:35:10,677
When the time is right

727
00:35:11,913 --> 00:35:12,913
just be ready.

728
00:35:14,381 --> 00:35:16,751
(siren ringing)

729
00:35:16,784 --> 00:35:19,486
(Roberts groaning)

730
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,256
(Roberts heavily breathing)

731
00:35:24,892 --> 00:35:25,892
Hang in there.

732
00:35:28,796 --> 00:35:30,364
I'm gonna get us out of this,

733
00:35:31,532 --> 00:35:33,300
you know I can.

734
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:34,401
You got it.

735
00:35:35,937 --> 00:35:37,404
Rachel, be ready.

736
00:35:37,437 --> 00:35:38,906
The coach has a plan.

737
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,675
He's not the only one.

738
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:41,709
What have you got?

739
00:35:42,844 --> 00:35:45,947
It started with eight of
us, the Warden makes nine

740
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,280
and if we count Charlotte-

741
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:50,250
Dammit, would you give it up,
Rachel.

742
00:35:50,283 --> 00:35:53,320
It's terrible what happened
to the woman but she's dead,

743
00:35:53,353 --> 00:35:55,690
she can't be behind any of this.

744
00:35:55,723 --> 00:35:56,824
(buzzer buzzing)

745
00:35:56,858 --> 00:35:59,627
Welcome back to the next
round of our little game.

746
00:35:59,661 --> 00:36:00,662
Monitors please,

747
00:36:00,695 --> 00:36:02,563
instructions coming.

748
00:36:02,597 --> 00:36:04,231
10 seconds to comply.

749
00:36:05,365 --> 00:36:08,770
Number One, 10 seconds to
comply or be eliminated.

750
00:36:13,941 --> 00:36:15,409
Final warning, Number One.

751
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:17,645
Comply now.

752
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:18,679
Oh.

753
00:36:20,313 --> 00:36:21,281
[Warden] As before,

754
00:36:21,314 --> 00:36:23,518
you will now perform a
non-suicidal self injury

755
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:26,319
with an instrument from your
locker.

756
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:28,422
You are each provided
with a duplicate item,

757
00:36:28,455 --> 00:36:30,658
however, the audience
will vote on the item

758
00:36:30,692 --> 00:36:33,193
and how you use it to be liked.

759
00:36:33,895 --> 00:36:35,596
Once again,

760
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,731
(chain clanking)

761
00:36:36,764 --> 00:36:39,634
I call bullshit.

762
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:40,668
Audience,

763
00:36:41,703 --> 00:36:42,703
vote now.

764
00:36:53,548 --> 00:36:57,384
Audience has chosen
item eight, the pliers,

765
00:36:57,417 --> 00:36:58,452
in a silent vote.

766
00:36:58,485 --> 00:37:01,388
Our audience was asked
what task you will perform

767
00:37:01,421 --> 00:37:02,690
with the pliers.

768
00:37:02,724 --> 00:37:04,391
The overwhelming majority voted

769
00:37:04,424 --> 00:37:07,260
for extraction of a
tooth of your choosing,

770
00:37:07,294 --> 00:37:09,864
failure to comply will lead yes

771
00:37:09,897 --> 00:37:11,264
to your elimination.

772
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:13,835
20 seconds to comply.

773
00:37:13,868 --> 00:37:15,469
Silent vote my ass.

774
00:37:15,503 --> 00:37:17,038
Come in here

775
00:37:17,071 --> 00:37:17,972
right now,

776
00:37:18,005 --> 00:37:19,640
little bitch.

777
00:37:19,674 --> 00:37:22,977
20, 19, 18, 17.

778
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:23,845
Whatever.

779
00:37:23,878 --> 00:37:25,479
[Warden] 16, 15.

780
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:30,752
10.

781
00:37:30,785 --> 00:37:33,521
(timer ticking)

782
00:37:34,722 --> 00:37:36,023
Five.

783
00:37:36,057 --> 00:37:37,357
Bring it.

784
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,726
I'm good to go.

785
00:37:39,627 --> 00:37:40,828
(buzzer buzzing)

786
00:37:40,862 --> 00:37:44,565
As before, you will perform
an non-suicidal self injury

787
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:47,434
with the instrument
chosen by our audience.

788
00:37:47,467 --> 00:37:50,872
Once chosen, you have
10 seconds to comply.

789
00:37:50,905 --> 00:37:51,839
The refusal to do so

790
00:37:51,873 --> 00:37:54,742
will result in your immediate
elimination.

791
00:37:54,776 --> 00:37:57,745
Audience, vote now to see who
begins.

792
00:37:59,013 --> 00:38:01,716
(ominous music)

793
00:38:03,416 --> 00:38:05,653
Two will begin this round.

794
00:38:05,686 --> 00:38:07,522
You have 10 seconds to comply.

795
00:38:07,555 --> 00:38:08,689
You got it rigged.

796
00:38:09,757 --> 00:38:11,324
This is your plan?

797
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:12,527
Fucking meat head.

798
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,393
[Warden] Six.

799
00:38:13,426 --> 00:38:14,061
You and me,

800
00:38:14,095 --> 00:38:14,729
bring it now.

801
00:38:14,762 --> 00:38:15,462
- [Warden] Four.
- Come on.

802
00:38:15,495 --> 00:38:17,098
- [Warden] Three, two.
- Do it.

803
00:38:17,131 --> 00:38:18,766
[Warden] One.

804
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,602
(buzzer buzzing)

805
00:38:25,807 --> 00:38:27,008
That's what I thought.

806
00:38:28,009 --> 00:38:30,678
The audience has voted
to award each captive

807
00:38:30,711 --> 00:38:33,781
a free pass to be used as they
see fit.

808
00:38:33,815 --> 00:38:35,415
Audience my ass.

809
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:37,985
You have to be kidding me.

810
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:39,120
[Warden] However-

811
00:38:39,153 --> 00:38:40,121
(Roberts laughs)

812
00:38:40,154 --> 00:38:41,289
However.

813
00:38:42,422 --> 00:38:43,925
It must be earned.

814
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:44,792
(Roberts laughs)

815
00:38:44,826 --> 00:38:45,826
Earned.

816
00:38:53,768 --> 00:38:54,802
The fuck is that?

817
00:38:55,903 --> 00:38:57,380
It's something you should
be well acquainted with

818
00:38:57,404 --> 00:38:58,438
in your profession.

819
00:39:00,508 --> 00:39:01,676
(injection thuds)

820
00:39:01,709 --> 00:39:03,476
(Roberts screaming)

821
00:39:03,511 --> 00:39:05,378
You just received the
concentrated injection

822
00:39:05,412 --> 00:39:08,716
of horse steroids and
some other little goodies.

823
00:39:09,717 --> 00:39:10,551
(Roberts groaning)

824
00:39:10,585 --> 00:39:13,054
It should really get your blood
pumping.

825
00:39:13,087 --> 00:39:14,121
(Roberts groaning)

826
00:39:14,155 --> 00:39:16,624
You know I got a bad heart.

827
00:39:16,657 --> 00:39:17,692
(Roberts screaming)

828
00:39:17,725 --> 00:39:19,459
You most certainly do.

829
00:39:20,493 --> 00:39:23,831
It was very, very bad.
(Roberts groaning)

830
00:39:23,865 --> 00:39:27,068
Now we'll all get to see
if you have the guts.

831
00:39:27,101 --> 00:39:28,803
(Roberts groaning)

832
00:39:28,836 --> 00:39:30,437
What did you do?

833
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:32,439
It's in my body.

834
00:39:32,472 --> 00:39:35,475
(Roberts screaming)

835
00:39:49,624 --> 00:39:51,559
It's growing inside me.

836
00:39:59,767 --> 00:40:00,735
I'm sorry.

837
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:03,571
(Roberts groaning)

838
00:40:03,604 --> 00:40:04,238
I feel you.

839
00:40:04,272 --> 00:40:09,476
I feel... (Robert groaning)

840
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,184
I see you

841
00:40:17,218 --> 00:40:19,020
get out!

842
00:40:19,053 --> 00:40:21,722
(Roberts groaning)

843
00:40:21,756 --> 00:40:22,924
(Roberts laughing)

844
00:40:22,957 --> 00:40:24,859
You're coming out.

845
00:40:24,892 --> 00:40:26,794
You're coming out.

846
00:40:26,827 --> 00:40:28,896
(Roberts laughing)

847
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,031
You're coming out.

848
00:40:30,064 --> 00:40:31,666
You're coming out.

849
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:34,635
(Roberts laughing)

850
00:40:46,847 --> 00:40:50,584
(Roberts heavily breathing)

851
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,829
(gentle music)

852
00:41:07,568 --> 00:41:12,039
(metal banging)
(chain clanking)

853
00:41:12,073 --> 00:41:13,140
(metal clanking)

854
00:41:13,174 --> 00:41:16,043
(Rachel groaning)

855
00:41:26,754 --> 00:41:28,189
Look, I did it.

856
00:41:28,222 --> 00:41:29,056
See?

857
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:29,957
See?

858
00:41:29,991 --> 00:41:31,158
Look.

859
00:41:31,192 --> 00:41:32,192
Look.

860
00:41:37,732 --> 00:41:38,732
I did it.

861
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:45,906
Why are you doing this?

862
00:41:46,974 --> 00:41:49,910
I don't deserve to be treated
this way,

863
00:41:50,811 --> 00:41:51,812
none of us do.

864
00:41:54,982 --> 00:41:57,084
(soft music)

865
00:41:57,118 --> 00:41:58,118
Charlotte.

866
00:42:00,321 --> 00:42:01,789
Rachel, come here.

867
00:42:01,822 --> 00:42:02,957
Come take one with me.

868
00:42:15,836 --> 00:42:16,670
Oh fuck.

869
00:42:16,704 --> 00:42:19,040
He just killed Coach Roberts
online.

870
00:42:19,073 --> 00:42:19,907
Okay, listen

871
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:20,775
we need some answers.

872
00:42:20,808 --> 00:42:22,843
We need them right now.

873
00:42:22,877 --> 00:42:24,078
How do we find this fucker?

874
00:42:24,111 --> 00:42:25,679
I know. I know.

875
00:42:25,713 --> 00:42:26,881
Casey, Casey, I got him.

876
00:42:26,914 --> 00:42:28,749
I got him, he's in the warehouse
district.

877
00:42:28,783 --> 00:42:30,951
You better be right, Tanner.

878
00:42:30,985 --> 00:42:33,788
You know I kind of miss
the old days before this,

879
00:42:33,821 --> 00:42:37,324
all this computer shit and
"Brings people together"

880
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:38,626
my ass.

881
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:40,661
All it does is inspire everybody

882
00:42:40,694 --> 00:42:43,764
to destroy ourselves quicker,

883
00:42:43,798 --> 00:42:44,598
that's it.

884
00:42:44,632 --> 00:42:45,776
Yeah, unfortunately I don't know

885
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,344
how the world would survive
without the worldwide web

886
00:42:47,368 --> 00:42:48,602
these days.

887
00:42:48,636 --> 00:42:49,737
We'll find a way.

888
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:52,073
We'll find a better way
without this virtual bullshit.

889
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,309
Says the man without any
friends,

890
00:42:55,342 --> 00:42:57,378
real or online.

891
00:42:57,411 --> 00:42:58,513
You know what?

892
00:42:58,547 --> 00:43:01,849
Friendship needs to be earned
and not just retweeted,

893
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:05,019
that's not where friendship
comes from.

894
00:43:05,052 --> 00:43:07,655
It's not something that
comes out of social media,

895
00:43:08,422 --> 00:43:10,100
it's something that comes
from a different place.

896
00:43:10,124 --> 00:43:11,124
A different time.

897
00:43:11,892 --> 00:43:13,427
Yeah, you're right.

898
00:43:17,298 --> 00:43:20,101
Right, Casey, it's right up
here.

899
00:43:20,134 --> 00:43:20,968
[Casey] Okay.

900
00:43:21,001 --> 00:43:21,836
Right here.

901
00:43:21,869 --> 00:43:22,869
Let's go in.

902
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,840
Charlotte.

903
00:43:28,876 --> 00:43:29,876
I'm sorry.

904
00:43:31,212 --> 00:43:32,212
I'm so sorry.

905
00:43:34,682 --> 00:43:35,783
Why?

906
00:43:36,951 --> 00:43:38,886
Why are you showing me your
photo?

907
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,020
Rachel,

908
00:43:42,723 --> 00:43:43,858
who are you talking to?

909
00:43:44,725 --> 00:43:45,725
What's going on?

910
00:43:47,094 --> 00:43:48,094
Can you hear me?

911
00:43:49,864 --> 00:43:50,864
I'm here.

912
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:54,034
I heard you talking to someone.

913
00:43:55,136 --> 00:43:57,938
(chain clanking)

914
00:44:04,178 --> 00:44:05,412
I was talking to myself.

915
00:44:07,348 --> 00:44:09,717
I do that when I get nervous,

916
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:10,918
scared.

917
00:44:10,951 --> 00:44:12,953
[Bruno] No, I get that.

918
00:44:12,987 --> 00:44:15,055
[Rachel] So much for
Coach Robert's plan.

919
00:44:16,023 --> 00:44:18,259
I don't know what he was
thinking.

920
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:19,927
He should have just listened.

921
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,863
If we play the game we buy more
time.

922
00:44:24,865 --> 00:44:26,100
Time enough to die.

923
00:44:26,133 --> 00:44:28,135
No, don't you say that.

924
00:44:28,169 --> 00:44:29,870
We can get through this.

925
00:44:29,904 --> 00:44:31,238
There's three of us left now.

926
00:44:33,908 --> 00:44:35,209
Then there were three.

927
00:44:35,242 --> 00:44:38,012
Jesus, Rachel, you've got to
give it up.

928
00:44:38,045 --> 00:44:39,346
This has nothing to do with
that.

929
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:42,249
This has everything to do with
it.

930
00:44:42,283 --> 00:44:46,820
Before we started talking a
photo flashed on my screen,

931
00:44:46,854 --> 00:44:49,089
it was a picture of Charlotte,

932
00:44:49,123 --> 00:44:50,090
Charlotte Knight.

933
00:44:50,124 --> 00:44:52,259
Charlotte Knight is dead.

934
00:44:52,293 --> 00:44:55,729
[Turner] Who in the
heck is Charlotte Knight?

935
00:44:55,763 --> 00:44:57,932
She was a teacher at our high
school,

936
00:44:57,965 --> 00:44:59,099
the theater department.

937
00:45:00,768 --> 00:45:02,970
I thought we defunded that
program.

938
00:45:03,003 --> 00:45:05,172
Yes, Mr. Turner, we did

939
00:45:05,206 --> 00:45:07,341
based on your forced budget
cuts.

940
00:45:07,374 --> 00:45:08,409
Uh, wait a minute.

941
00:45:08,442 --> 00:45:11,745
It was your decision on
which after school programs

942
00:45:11,779 --> 00:45:14,448
we were gonna lose or cut.

943
00:45:14,481 --> 00:45:16,884
Yes, yes it was

944
00:45:16,917 --> 00:45:20,487
and we all signed off on it,
it was a unanimous decision.

945
00:45:20,522 --> 00:45:22,923
Like we had much of a choice.

946
00:45:22,957 --> 00:45:25,392
You sure as hell weren't going
to cut the sports program

947
00:45:25,426 --> 00:45:27,428
or the math and science
divisions.

948
00:45:27,461 --> 00:45:30,264
It's always the arts that has to
go.

949
00:45:30,297 --> 00:45:31,542
This isn't getting us anywhere.

950
00:45:31,566 --> 00:45:34,435
We need to focus on getting out
of here.

951
00:45:36,437 --> 00:45:38,772
Have either of you
been paying attention?

952
00:45:39,541 --> 00:45:42,176
We are all connected to
what happened to Charlotte.

953
00:45:43,477 --> 00:45:45,879
Mr. Turner initiated the
cutback.

954
00:45:45,913 --> 00:45:48,516
You carried out the directive
and we all supported it.

955
00:45:52,052 --> 00:45:54,154
The theater meant everything to
Charlotte,

956
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:56,824
it was her whole life

957
00:45:58,292 --> 00:45:59,292
and we,

958
00:46:00,894 --> 00:46:02,096
we took it away from her.

959
00:46:03,297 --> 00:46:07,134
Nobody forced you to sign
the petition, Ms. Phillips.

960
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:09,436
Oh the hell you didn't.

961
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:11,539
Look, we all agreed,

962
00:46:11,573 --> 00:46:14,241
the play she wanted to do was
too violent

963
00:46:14,275 --> 00:46:16,110
for high school kids.

964
00:46:18,312 --> 00:46:21,348
I hope the irony of that
decision isn't lost on you now.

965
00:46:28,255 --> 00:46:29,423
It doesn't matter anyway

966
00:46:31,058 --> 00:46:32,426
we're all gonna die,

967
00:46:34,261 --> 00:46:37,197
it's just a question of how.

968
00:46:37,231 --> 00:46:39,967
(siren ringing)

969
00:46:42,336 --> 00:46:43,336
And we're back.

970
00:46:44,305 --> 00:46:46,040
The three remaining Indians,

971
00:46:46,073 --> 00:46:47,875
I mean, players.

972
00:46:47,908 --> 00:46:51,845
Stand before your monitors and
await further instructions.

973
00:46:51,879 --> 00:46:52,813
I take it by now

974
00:46:52,846 --> 00:46:55,550
you have all come to
understand at some level

975
00:46:55,583 --> 00:46:57,351
why you are here.

976
00:46:57,384 --> 00:46:59,920
Your confederates have been
dealt with

977
00:46:59,953 --> 00:47:02,189
and you must all pay for your
sins.

978
00:47:03,123 --> 00:47:04,958
Sins you committed.

979
00:47:04,992 --> 00:47:08,162
Sins that an innocent
paid for with her life,

980
00:47:08,195 --> 00:47:11,198
a life cut short, a debt is
owed.

981
00:47:11,231 --> 00:47:14,501
I still don't have a clue
what you're talking about.

982
00:47:14,536 --> 00:47:16,236
I don't belong in here.

983
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:19,039
I don't even know what
I did to deserve this.

984
00:47:19,073 --> 00:47:20,542
I think you've made a mistake
here.

985
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:23,310
10 little, nine little,
eight little Indians,

986
00:47:23,344 --> 00:47:26,146
seven little, six little,
five little Indians,

987
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:28,415
four little, three little,
two little Indians.

988
00:47:28,449 --> 00:47:30,451
And what is this "Little
Indian" thing all about?

989
00:47:30,484 --> 00:47:32,152
For your information,

990
00:47:32,186 --> 00:47:35,289
the correct term is Native
American.

991
00:47:35,322 --> 00:47:37,291
10 Little Indians was a novel

992
00:47:37,324 --> 00:47:40,662
and then a play later
written by A gather Christie.

993
00:47:40,695 --> 00:47:44,131
It's about 10 people who are
invited by an unknown host

994
00:47:44,164 --> 00:47:47,669
to an isolated location, where
they're accused of crimes

995
00:47:47,702 --> 00:47:52,005
and then murdered one by one.

996
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,451
Charlotte was planning
on putting on that play

997
00:47:54,475 --> 00:47:57,612
at the high school before
it was deemed inappropriate

998
00:47:57,645 --> 00:47:59,514
by Principal Bruno,

999
00:47:59,547 --> 00:48:02,383
who in turn sent out a letter

1000
00:48:02,416 --> 00:48:04,985
that all the members
of the faculty signed,

1001
00:48:05,018 --> 00:48:07,988
thus resulting in the
cancellation of her show

1002
00:48:08,656 --> 00:48:11,191
and the entire theater
department dismantled.

1003
00:48:12,459 --> 00:48:15,195
(ominous music)

1004
00:48:16,997 --> 00:48:19,567
Charlotte died soon after these
events.

1005
00:48:19,601 --> 00:48:20,434
How?

1006
00:48:20,467 --> 00:48:23,036
The coroner report said it was
suicide.

1007
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:24,672
[Woman] The coroner report was
wrong.

1008
00:48:24,706 --> 00:48:25,607
Who said that?

1009
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,306
Who is that?

1010
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:27,941
Is somebody else out there?

1011
00:48:27,975 --> 00:48:29,711
Help, please help us.

1012
00:48:29,744 --> 00:48:32,680
Thank you, Number
Three, for filling us in.

1013
00:48:32,714 --> 00:48:36,016
Now, one of you was in a
position to help Charlotte

1014
00:48:36,049 --> 00:48:37,049
but did not.

1015
00:48:37,985 --> 00:48:41,054
You did not help a young
woman who was in need,

1016
00:48:41,088 --> 00:48:43,223
all due to increase the bottom
line

1017
00:48:43,257 --> 00:48:45,527
and out of fear you did nothing.

1018
00:48:47,094 --> 00:48:50,532
Therefore, you will each perform
an non-suicidal self injury

1019
00:48:50,565 --> 00:48:53,467
with the instrument
chosen by our audience.

1020
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,236
Once chosen, you will
have 20 seconds to comply,

1021
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:59,574
refusal to do so will result
in your immediate elimination.

1022
00:48:59,607 --> 00:49:01,576
The voting will begin now.

1023
00:49:03,711 --> 00:49:05,212
You heard that, right?

1024
00:49:05,245 --> 00:49:06,614
Yeah.

1025
00:49:06,648 --> 00:49:08,348
The Warden's not alone.

1026
00:49:08,382 --> 00:49:09,382
[Bruno] Who is she?

1027
00:49:10,618 --> 00:49:11,618
Where is she?

1028
00:49:12,554 --> 00:49:15,289
(ominous music)

1029
00:49:16,323 --> 00:49:18,959
Our audience has chosen
instrument Number One,

1030
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,328
the drill.

1031
00:49:21,361 --> 00:49:24,331
You have 20 seconds to secure
your drill

1032
00:49:24,364 --> 00:49:26,266
and return to the camera.

1033
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,135
20, 19.

1034
00:49:28,168 --> 00:49:29,002
Wait.

1035
00:49:29,036 --> 00:49:29,671
[Warden] 18.

1036
00:49:29,704 --> 00:49:30,538
Wait.

1037
00:49:30,572 --> 00:49:31,338
[Warden] 17.

1038
00:49:31,371 --> 00:49:32,483
- This isn't fair.
- [Warden] 16.

1039
00:49:32,507 --> 00:49:34,417
I was the only one who
participated in the last round.

1040
00:49:34,441 --> 00:49:35,442
[Warden] 13, 12.

1041
00:49:35,476 --> 00:49:36,644
Remember the pliers?

1042
00:49:36,678 --> 00:49:37,512
[Warden] 10.

1043
00:49:37,545 --> 00:49:38,345
The tooth.

1044
00:49:38,378 --> 00:49:40,414
Don't I get bonus points for
this?

1045
00:49:40,447 --> 00:49:41,482
[Warden] Seven.

1046
00:49:41,516 --> 00:49:42,349
Hurry up.

1047
00:49:42,382 --> 00:49:44,117
Four, three, two.

1048
00:49:44,151 --> 00:49:46,788
You know that Coach Roberts
was right.

1049
00:49:46,821 --> 00:49:47,454
(buzzer buzzing)

1050
00:49:47,488 --> 00:49:48,656
This whole thing is rigged.

1051
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:49,657
As mentioned previously,

1052
00:49:49,691 --> 00:49:52,326
you will each perform an
non-suicidal self injury

1053
00:49:52,359 --> 00:49:53,193
with your drill.

1054
00:49:53,227 --> 00:49:55,128
However, before we begin

1055
00:49:55,162 --> 00:49:56,764
each of you will be given an
opportunity

1056
00:49:56,798 --> 00:49:59,032
to defend yourselves and your
actions

1057
00:49:59,066 --> 00:50:01,769
with regard to the death
of Charlotte Knight.

1058
00:50:01,803 --> 00:50:03,403
I had nothing to do with her
death.

1059
00:50:03,437 --> 00:50:04,806
My conscience is clear.

1060
00:50:04,839 --> 00:50:07,509
I never even met the girl.

1061
00:50:07,542 --> 00:50:09,744
Should our audience believe
your defense

1062
00:50:09,777 --> 00:50:13,447
you'll be rewarded with a
pass and will not be required

1063
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,583
to participate in this round.

1064
00:50:15,617 --> 00:50:17,585
They didn't participate
in the last round

1065
00:50:17,619 --> 00:50:20,320
I was the only one who did, you
moron.

1066
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:23,123
Disrupt the game once more
and you will be eliminated,

1067
00:50:23,156 --> 00:50:23,791
Number One.

1068
00:50:23,825 --> 00:50:25,459
And by the way,

1069
00:50:25,492 --> 00:50:29,129
I'm quite aware that the tooth
you pulled was a prosthesis.

1070
00:50:29,162 --> 00:50:31,465
You lost that tooth years
ago and had it replaced

1071
00:50:31,498 --> 00:50:35,402
with a painted acrylic one, it
was a fake.

1072
00:50:35,435 --> 00:50:36,470
So?

1073
00:50:36,504 --> 00:50:39,774
You told us we could use
any tooth of our choosing.

1074
00:50:39,807 --> 00:50:42,577
I was still playing by your
rule.

1075
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:43,511
Enough.

1076
00:50:43,545 --> 00:50:46,681
(kerosene sprinkling)

1077
00:50:48,783 --> 00:50:50,217
What the hell?

1078
00:50:52,252 --> 00:50:53,621
This isn't water.

1079
00:50:53,655 --> 00:50:55,757
Correct, it's kerosene.

1080
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:58,091
Interrupt me again and you
will be playing this round

1081
00:50:58,125 --> 00:51:02,095
with item number two, the
propane torch.

1082
00:51:02,129 --> 00:51:04,532
Actually, due to these
outbursts,

1083
00:51:04,566 --> 00:51:06,534
one shall be punished.

1084
00:51:06,568 --> 00:51:08,670
He has lost the opportunity
to defend himself

1085
00:51:08,703 --> 00:51:11,271
in regards to the death
of Charlotte Knight

1086
00:51:11,305 --> 00:51:15,375
and must now proceed with the
self injury using his drill.

1087
00:51:15,409 --> 00:51:16,587
He has five seconds to comply.

1088
00:51:16,611 --> 00:51:20,882
Five, four, three, two.

1089
00:51:20,915 --> 00:51:21,816
You know what?

1090
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:22,884
(buzzer buzzing)

1091
00:51:22,917 --> 00:51:24,519
Screw you.

1092
00:51:24,552 --> 00:51:27,421
(drill drilling)

1093
00:51:27,454 --> 00:51:28,656
You motherfucker,

1094
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:30,658
I'm gonna get you you bastard.

1095
00:51:30,692 --> 00:51:33,093
You son of a bitch, you
motherfucker.

1096
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:40,267
(Turner screaming)
(fire beaming)

1097
00:51:56,551 --> 00:51:58,820
[Warden] We will resume
momentarily.

1098
00:51:58,853 --> 00:52:01,522
(gentle music)

1099
00:52:07,829 --> 00:52:10,698
(Turner sizzling)

1100
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:18,205
(ominous music)

1101
00:52:18,238 --> 00:52:19,574
Holy shit.

1102
00:52:19,607 --> 00:52:20,575
What happened?

1103
00:52:20,608 --> 00:52:22,218
Number One just lit
up like a Roman candle

1104
00:52:22,242 --> 00:52:23,176
on the 4th of July.

1105
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:25,747
Looks like the whole
room went up in flames.

1106
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:26,614
Good.

1107
00:52:26,648 --> 00:52:27,582
Good?

1108
00:52:27,615 --> 00:52:28,850
Why the hell is that good?

1109
00:52:28,883 --> 00:52:32,587
Because where there's
fire there's smoke.

1110
00:52:33,487 --> 00:52:34,922
(Tanner laughs)

1111
00:52:34,956 --> 00:52:36,658
Captain this is Detective Casey,

1112
00:52:36,691 --> 00:52:39,292
I need a chopper to fly
over the warehouse district.

1113
00:52:39,326 --> 00:52:41,395
Tell him to light up all
the abandoned buildings

1114
00:52:41,428 --> 00:52:43,330
in this whole area, over.

1115
00:52:43,363 --> 00:52:44,197
[Captain Oliver] Okay.

1116
00:52:44,231 --> 00:52:45,700
What's it searching for?

1117
00:52:45,733 --> 00:52:48,235
Look for a thick black smoke.

1118
00:53:03,785 --> 00:53:05,553
[Bruno] You were right,

1119
00:53:05,586 --> 00:53:06,621
we are gonna die.

1120
00:53:10,925 --> 00:53:12,994
Well, whose fault is that?

1121
00:53:13,027 --> 00:53:14,829
Don't you put this off on me.

1122
00:53:14,862 --> 00:53:16,564
Charlotte and I were friends,

1123
00:53:16,597 --> 00:53:18,766
she told me she begged
you not to cancel her show

1124
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,333
and cut her apartment.

1125
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:22,804
She lived for the theater and
you knew it.

1126
00:53:22,837 --> 00:53:23,905
Do I need to remind you

1127
00:53:23,938 --> 00:53:26,507
that you signed that piece of
paper

1128
00:53:26,541 --> 00:53:27,942
like everyone else?

1129
00:53:27,975 --> 00:53:32,847
If that's what led to her
suicide it's on all of us.

1130
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,316
You forced me to sign
it, you blackmailed me.

1131
00:53:36,349 --> 00:53:38,786
I guess I forced you to
fuck Simon too, didn't I?

1132
00:53:41,522 --> 00:53:42,522
I didn't know.

1133
00:53:44,592 --> 00:53:46,493
I told you I never met her
husband.

1134
00:53:47,995 --> 00:53:49,664
He never told me he was married,

1135
00:53:49,697 --> 00:53:51,298
he wasn't even wearing a ring.

1136
00:53:55,536 --> 00:53:56,804
It's not my fault.

1137
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:00,675
Simon picked me up that night at
the bar.

1138
00:54:01,776 --> 00:54:04,344
Why didn't you just
tell her what happened?

1139
00:54:06,681 --> 00:54:10,417
I knew if she found out
it would've destroyed her.

1140
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,455
Well, I guess you were right.

1141
00:54:15,489 --> 00:54:16,724
How clairvoyant of you.

1142
00:54:17,759 --> 00:54:20,828
Wait, did you tell
her, you son of a bitch?

1143
00:54:20,862 --> 00:54:22,997
That's the only reason I
signed your goddam letter

1144
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:24,565
so she wouldn't find out.

1145
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:26,968
You promised you wouldn't say a
word.

1146
00:54:27,001 --> 00:54:30,004
You weren't there when I
had to give her the bad news.

1147
00:54:30,037 --> 00:54:33,007
She was angry, she came at me.

1148
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,010
She blamed me for ruining her
career.

1149
00:54:37,979 --> 00:54:39,446
I just simply said,

1150
00:54:39,479 --> 00:54:42,784
if she were more concerned
about her home life

1151
00:54:42,817 --> 00:54:45,787
as she was her professional
life,

1152
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:47,354
well, maybe.

1153
00:54:50,758 --> 00:54:52,660
You asshole.

1154
00:54:52,693 --> 00:54:54,394
You told her.

1155
00:54:55,663 --> 00:54:57,532
She figured it out for herself.

1156
00:54:57,565 --> 00:54:59,033
And she killed herself.

1157
00:55:00,467 --> 00:55:04,939
Her job, her passion, her
marriage, all on the same day

1158
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:07,440
and we drove her to it.

1159
00:55:11,612 --> 00:55:13,681
We are responsible.

1160
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:18,753
(siren ringing)

1161
00:55:18,786 --> 00:55:19,830
Thank you for your patience.

1162
00:55:19,854 --> 00:55:24,491
Due to the unscheduled
elimination of Number One

1163
00:55:24,525 --> 00:55:27,061
we are now down to only two
players.

1164
00:55:27,094 --> 00:55:29,396
Therefore, we shall skip ahead

1165
00:55:29,429 --> 00:55:31,833
to the final lightning rounds of
the game.

1166
00:55:31,866 --> 00:55:35,970
Number Three and Four
stand before your monitors,

1167
00:55:36,003 --> 00:55:37,972
you have five seconds to comply.

1168
00:55:38,005 --> 00:55:42,777
Five, four, three, two, one.

1169
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:44,579
(buzzer buzzing)

1170
00:55:44,612 --> 00:55:45,780
As the final two,

1171
00:55:45,813 --> 00:55:49,951
our audience has silently
voted that if you use your head

1172
00:55:49,984 --> 00:55:52,385
the winner will be unleashed.

1173
00:55:52,419 --> 00:55:55,823
However, only one of you will
be allowed this opportunity.

1174
00:55:55,857 --> 00:56:00,628
The question is, how far are
you willing to go to be liked?

1175
00:56:00,661 --> 00:56:01,796
Audience my ass.

1176
00:56:01,829 --> 00:56:04,131
It's only you out there, whoever
you are.

1177
00:56:04,165 --> 00:56:06,968
You will each be given
30 seconds to be liked.

1178
00:56:07,001 --> 00:56:09,871
There will be three lightning
rounds.

1179
00:56:09,904 --> 00:56:14,909
The captive most liked will be
freed, the other eliminated.

1180
00:56:14,942 --> 00:56:16,944
You will have two minutes
to consider your strategy

1181
00:56:16,978 --> 00:56:19,013
and items of use.

1182
00:56:38,032 --> 00:56:39,166
What if we refuse?

1183
00:56:41,135 --> 00:56:41,969
What?

1184
00:56:42,003 --> 00:56:44,805
What if we just refuse?

1185
00:56:44,839 --> 00:56:46,874
We stop playing this sick game.

1186
00:56:46,908 --> 00:56:48,509
We just refuse.

1187
00:56:48,542 --> 00:56:50,878
Then we just die.

1188
00:56:50,912 --> 00:56:52,980
Her blood is on our hands.

1189
00:56:53,014 --> 00:56:54,081
We are responsible.

1190
00:56:54,115 --> 00:56:55,816
No, we are not.

1191
00:56:57,051 --> 00:56:59,954
School programs get cut all the
time.

1192
00:56:59,987 --> 00:57:02,757
Husbands cheat on wives.

1193
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:05,593
Charlotte had her choice
and she chose to die.

1194
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:09,163
This is just some sick vendetta.

1195
00:57:10,965 --> 00:57:11,965
Vendetta?

1196
00:57:13,701 --> 00:57:16,469
Oh my God, I think I
know who's behind this.

1197
00:57:19,206 --> 00:57:20,473
Care to fill me in?

1198
00:57:21,976 --> 00:57:23,844
Look, Rachel.

1199
00:57:23,878 --> 00:57:24,712
My fight's not with you,

1200
00:57:24,745 --> 00:57:27,114
it's with this sick fucker doing
this.

1201
00:57:28,549 --> 00:57:29,817
Live or die,

1202
00:57:31,886 --> 00:57:33,888
it's got to be on our own terms.

1203
00:57:33,921 --> 00:57:37,024
(timer ticking)

1204
00:57:37,058 --> 00:57:39,860
(chain clanking)

1205
00:57:46,734 --> 00:57:48,636
Before we get started

1206
00:57:48,669 --> 00:57:51,205
I think it's only fair that we
share with everyone watching

1207
00:57:51,238 --> 00:57:53,874
who the Warden really is.

1208
00:57:53,908 --> 00:57:56,010
(Warden laughing)

1209
00:57:56,043 --> 00:57:57,078
Do tell.

1210
00:57:57,111 --> 00:57:58,779
Come on, Simon,

1211
00:57:58,813 --> 00:58:00,748
I know you're behind this.

1212
00:58:00,781 --> 00:58:02,049
Show yourself.

1213
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:02,917
(buzzer buzzing)

1214
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:05,619
(gentle music)

1215
00:58:14,061 --> 00:58:15,096
Oh my God, Simon.

1216
00:58:22,937 --> 00:58:24,672
Sorry, Number Three.

1217
00:58:24,705 --> 00:58:27,742
Simon Knight is not the
one calling the shots here.

1218
00:58:27,775 --> 00:58:30,678
In fact, he was the
first one to be captured,

1219
00:58:30,711 --> 00:58:32,513
the spine that he is.

1220
00:58:41,255 --> 00:58:42,255
Now,

1221
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:44,859
where were we?

1222
00:58:44,892 --> 00:58:46,132
So then who the fuck are you?

1223
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,862
Uh, uh, sorry,

1224
00:58:47,895 --> 00:58:50,831
only one guess at a time
during the lightning round.

1225
00:58:50,865 --> 00:58:53,901
Now, our audience will
vote as to which of you

1226
00:58:53,934 --> 00:58:56,237
they feel has been the most
contrite

1227
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:59,073
and will reward that person
appropriately.

1228
00:58:59,106 --> 00:59:00,041
At the end of the three rounds

1229
00:59:00,074 --> 00:59:03,177
the individual most
like will be unleashed.

1230
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:05,746
For the first round you
will have 15 seconds

1231
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:07,314
to perform your penance.

1232
00:59:07,348 --> 00:59:10,084
Round one begins now.

1233
00:59:10,117 --> 00:59:12,853
(ominous music)

1234
00:59:15,222 --> 00:59:17,691
10, nine, eight, seven, six.

1235
00:59:19,326 --> 00:59:23,931
(hammer banging)
Five, four, three, two, one.

1236
00:59:25,266 --> 00:59:30,271
(Rachel screaming)
(metal banging)

1237
00:59:42,883 --> 00:59:43,960
What are you seeing up there?

1238
00:59:43,984 --> 00:59:45,286
Over.

1239
00:59:45,319 --> 00:59:45,986
[Pilot] There's signs of smoke

1240
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:47,260
generating from warehouse seven

1241
00:59:47,288 --> 00:59:48,222
located in the rear.

1242
00:59:48,255 --> 00:59:49,390
Listen, call for backup

1243
00:59:49,423 --> 00:59:51,859
'cause I think we might have
found this son of a bitch,

1244
00:59:51,892 --> 00:59:53,828
all right and I hope it's not
too late.

1245
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:00,301
Four is in the lead.

1246
01:00:00,334 --> 01:00:02,937
Ready for lightning round two?

1247
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:05,873
Would you care to take another
guess

1248
01:00:05,906 --> 01:00:07,641
who is behind this?

1249
01:00:08,742 --> 01:00:09,810
I'll give you a hint,

1250
01:00:10,945 --> 01:00:13,380
there's nothing like a woman
scorned,

1251
01:00:15,249 --> 01:00:16,249
nothing.

1252
01:00:17,351 --> 01:00:19,019
No, it can't be.

1253
01:00:20,387 --> 01:00:21,755
It can't be Charlotte,

1254
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:24,058
I was at her funeral.

1255
01:00:24,091 --> 01:00:25,893
She's fucking dead.

1256
01:00:25,926 --> 01:00:27,261
I was there too.

1257
01:00:27,294 --> 01:00:29,864
This can't be 10 Little Indians
for real.

1258
01:00:29,897 --> 01:00:32,099
(ominous music)

1259
01:00:32,133 --> 01:00:33,067
Yes, Rachel.

1260
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:34,101
My daughter is dead.

1261
01:00:35,169 --> 01:00:36,704
You took her away from me.

1262
01:00:36,737 --> 01:00:38,772
You all did by your actions

1263
01:00:38,806 --> 01:00:40,341
and now you're going to repent.

1264
01:00:40,374 --> 01:00:43,444
This is your last
opportunity for redemption.

1265
01:00:43,477 --> 01:00:45,112
Oh, what the fuck?

1266
01:00:45,146 --> 01:00:47,081
This is about a mother's
revenge?

1267
01:00:47,114 --> 01:00:48,449
Who the fuck is this guy?

1268
01:00:48,482 --> 01:00:50,217
Uncle Joe?

1269
01:00:50,251 --> 01:00:53,354
It's a hired hand doing the
Lord's work.

1270
01:00:53,387 --> 01:00:56,257
As I said, I am the Warden.

1271
01:00:56,290 --> 01:00:58,959
I see to it that justice is
served.

1272
01:00:58,993 --> 01:01:01,061
I write the wrongs in society.

1273
01:01:01,095 --> 01:01:04,999
Consider me a Dark Avenger
for our dark times.

1274
01:01:05,032 --> 01:01:06,901
When I heard what happened to
Charlotte,

1275
01:01:06,934 --> 01:01:10,971
I happily took Mrs. Pine's
case free of charge.

1276
01:01:11,005 --> 01:01:12,005
Thank you.

1277
01:01:12,973 --> 01:01:15,176
But enough about me,

1278
01:01:15,209 --> 01:01:18,045
lightning round two begins now.

1279
01:01:18,078 --> 01:01:21,415
You will continue to acquire
as many likes as possible,

1280
01:01:21,448 --> 01:01:23,450
the winner who is most liked

1281
01:01:23,484 --> 01:01:28,088
at the end of the third and
final round will be set free.

1282
01:01:28,122 --> 01:01:28,956
(Bruno sighs)

1283
01:01:28,989 --> 01:01:30,057
Now

1284
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:31,859
the question remains,

1285
01:01:31,892 --> 01:01:35,429
how far are you willing to go to
be liked?

1286
01:01:35,462 --> 01:01:37,231
Why don't you show us your face?

1287
01:01:37,264 --> 01:01:37,932
Or are you afraid?

1288
01:01:37,965 --> 01:01:39,900
Now as with the first round

1289
01:01:39,934 --> 01:01:42,436
you will have 15 seconds
to perform your penance.

1290
01:01:42,469 --> 01:01:43,469
Begin now.

1291
01:01:44,772 --> 01:01:46,840
(timer ticking)

1292
01:01:46,874 --> 01:01:48,375
(siren ringing)

1293
01:01:48,409 --> 01:01:50,945
Four, you have no instrument,

1294
01:01:50,978 --> 01:01:53,280
you must participate or be
eliminated.

1295
01:01:53,314 --> 01:01:56,050
(siren ringing)

1296
01:01:58,452 --> 01:02:01,755
No, I'm done with this
bullshit game.

1297
01:02:01,789 --> 01:02:02,856
Number Four,

1298
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:06,060
are you stating that you
will no longer participate?

1299
01:02:06,093 --> 01:02:10,831
It's my understanding of
the rules that you stated

1300
01:02:10,864 --> 01:02:12,499
that the one with the most likes

1301
01:02:12,534 --> 01:02:14,268
at the end of the final round

1302
01:02:14,301 --> 01:02:17,104
will be afforded the
opportunity to be released.

1303
01:02:18,372 --> 01:02:21,375
I'm saying it's Number
Three, Rachel Phillips.

1304
01:02:22,476 --> 01:02:24,345
I'm calling the shots.

1305
01:02:24,378 --> 01:02:26,280
I'm making the decisions.

1306
01:02:26,313 --> 01:02:29,316
You can't play this game
with only one person.

1307
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:31,185
Uh, so be it.

1308
01:02:31,218 --> 01:02:32,520
No,

1309
01:02:32,554 --> 01:02:34,121
make him die slowly.

1310
01:02:35,856 --> 01:02:38,892
Never argue with a vengeful
mother.

1311
01:02:38,926 --> 01:02:42,229
(electricity buzzing)

1312
01:02:42,263 --> 01:02:43,430
No,

1313
01:02:43,464 --> 01:02:44,298
stop.

1314
01:02:44,331 --> 01:02:47,468
(electricity buzzing)

1315
01:02:49,303 --> 01:02:50,204
Number Three,

1316
01:02:50,237 --> 01:02:52,106
you have five seconds to comply

1317
01:02:52,139 --> 01:02:54,408
or you will suffer the same
fate.

1318
01:02:54,441 --> 01:02:58,412
Five, four, three, two, one.

1319
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,096
(electricity buzzing)

1320
01:03:37,652 --> 01:03:40,387
(ominous music)

1321
01:03:42,423 --> 01:03:45,326
I believe school is now out of
session.

1322
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:47,027
You son of a pitch.

1323
01:03:48,462 --> 01:03:50,864
Round three starts now, Number
Three,

1324
01:03:50,898 --> 01:03:53,267
choose your item and
continue with your penance.

1325
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:55,436
Once you have been liked 10,000
times

1326
01:03:55,469 --> 01:03:57,371
you will be freed.

1327
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,543
Wait, I had more likes than
that.

1328
01:04:01,576 --> 01:04:04,111
You have to earn your freedom.

1329
01:04:04,144 --> 01:04:05,879
Begin.

1330
01:04:05,913 --> 01:04:08,449
(ominous music)

1331
01:04:20,027 --> 01:04:22,296
(door bangs)

1332
01:04:22,329 --> 01:04:24,932
(car beeping)

1333
01:04:37,579 --> 01:04:40,414
(alarm ringing)

1334
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:42,349
[Woman] What's that?

1335
01:04:42,383 --> 01:04:44,418
Looks like we have company.

1336
01:04:44,451 --> 01:04:47,121
Our little game might be
coming to an end soon.

1337
01:04:47,154 --> 01:04:48,956
Continue, Number Three,

1338
01:04:48,989 --> 01:04:52,393
7,000 more likes than you could
be free.

1339
01:04:52,426 --> 01:04:54,261
It's all up to you now.

1340
01:04:54,294 --> 01:04:55,563
No, I want them to die,

1341
01:04:55,597 --> 01:04:57,665
I want them to all die.

1342
01:04:57,699 --> 01:05:00,100
Now, that's not very sporty.

1343
01:05:00,134 --> 01:05:02,269
I'm not leaving until it's over.

1344
01:05:06,073 --> 01:05:09,009
(Rachel screaming)

1345
01:05:41,743 --> 01:05:43,143
Enough.

1346
01:05:43,177 --> 01:05:46,447
(woman laughing)

1347
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:47,480
Again.

1348
01:05:50,518 --> 01:05:51,518
Freeze, asshole.

1349
01:05:52,587 --> 01:05:54,188
You dumb fuck.

1350
01:05:54,221 --> 01:05:56,758
Warden, it's your stupid
nickname, huh?

1351
01:05:56,791 --> 01:05:57,759
[Tanner] Don't fucking move.

1352
01:05:57,792 --> 01:05:59,527
Congratulations, gentlemen.

1353
01:06:00,427 --> 01:06:03,163
You arrived just in time for the
finale.

1354
01:06:03,197 --> 01:06:05,265
Go ahead, make a move

1355
01:06:05,299 --> 01:06:07,401
and I'll blow your brains
Goddamn brains out.

1356
01:06:07,434 --> 01:06:10,170
Okay, I won't but you have to

1357
01:06:11,238 --> 01:06:13,541
if you wanna save that final
girl.

1358
01:06:13,575 --> 01:06:16,511
(Rachel screaming)

1359
01:06:36,664 --> 01:06:39,534
I'm sorry about Charlotte, I am.

1360
01:06:43,237 --> 01:06:46,139
I didn't mean to hurt her.

1361
01:06:46,173 --> 01:06:48,108
It was all a terrible mistake.

1362
01:06:50,310 --> 01:06:51,646
Simon tricked me.

1363
01:06:53,648 --> 01:06:54,716
Bruno lied to me.

1364
01:06:56,684 --> 01:06:58,553
I'd take it all back if I could,

1365
01:06:59,754 --> 01:07:01,255
I swear.

1366
01:07:01,288 --> 01:07:02,590
Than do it.

1367
01:07:02,624 --> 01:07:04,592
10,000 likes remember?

1368
01:07:10,163 --> 01:07:11,163
Fine.

1369
01:07:12,634 --> 01:07:13,835
Is this what you want?

1370
01:07:13,868 --> 01:07:15,369
(woman laughing)

1371
01:07:15,402 --> 01:07:16,402
Is it?

1372
01:07:17,204 --> 01:07:17,839
Yes.

1373
01:07:17,872 --> 01:07:19,741
(woman laughing)

1374
01:07:19,774 --> 01:07:21,174
Fuck you all.

1375
01:07:22,777 --> 01:07:25,713
(Rachel screaming)

1376
01:07:41,228 --> 01:07:42,764
Where's Rachel?

1377
01:07:42,797 --> 01:07:45,499
She's here, still alive.

1378
01:07:45,533 --> 01:07:46,366
I think.

1379
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,267
Where is she?

1380
01:07:47,301 --> 01:07:49,571
Well, that gets a little
complicated.

1381
01:07:49,604 --> 01:07:50,772
Start down that hallway,

1382
01:07:51,706 --> 01:07:54,609
take a left then take a right

1383
01:07:54,642 --> 01:07:58,813
then take two lefts down the
staircase through the tunnel.

1384
01:07:58,846 --> 01:08:00,715
Why don't you show us, dickhead?

1385
01:08:00,748 --> 01:08:02,282
That means I'd have to move.

1386
01:08:02,316 --> 01:08:03,383
Then move

1387
01:08:03,417 --> 01:08:04,418
and move now,

1388
01:08:04,451 --> 01:08:05,553
get over here.

1389
01:08:05,587 --> 01:08:08,355
You need to lock your fingers
behind your Goddamn head

1390
01:08:08,388 --> 01:08:09,757
before I blow it off.

1391
01:08:09,791 --> 01:08:10,792
As you wish.

1392
01:08:14,194 --> 01:08:16,531
(smoke bomb)

1393
01:08:17,699 --> 01:08:20,167
(gun shots)

1394
01:08:21,168 --> 01:08:22,211
Go that way, I'll go this way.

1395
01:08:22,235 --> 01:08:23,771
[Tanner] Okay.

1396
01:08:23,805 --> 01:08:26,541
(ominous music)

1397
01:08:43,691 --> 01:08:44,792
(Rachel screaming)

1398
01:08:44,826 --> 01:08:46,159
(woman laughing)

1399
01:08:46,193 --> 01:08:47,895
You lose my dear.

1400
01:08:47,929 --> 01:08:50,765
10,000 likes, remember?

1401
01:08:50,798 --> 01:08:53,601
(Rachel screams)

1402
01:09:03,878 --> 01:09:04,878
I win

1403
01:09:06,748 --> 01:09:08,750
even if you kill me now.

1404
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:11,350
I beat you.

1405
01:09:19,661 --> 01:09:23,531
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

1406
01:09:23,564 --> 01:09:26,801
Die, die.

1407
01:09:26,834 --> 01:09:28,235
You got to die.

1408
01:09:29,771 --> 01:09:30,638
Die.

1409
01:09:30,672 --> 01:09:33,473
(fire explosion)

1410
01:09:55,530 --> 01:09:56,764
I got you.

1411
01:09:56,798 --> 01:09:58,498
I got you.

1412
01:09:58,533 --> 01:10:00,802
(gun shots)

1413
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:05,372
(Simon groaning)

1414
01:10:06,607 --> 01:10:07,607
Casey,

1415
01:10:16,517 --> 01:10:17,952
Casey, did you get him?

1416
01:10:22,657 --> 01:10:23,657
Uh shit.

1417
01:10:29,731 --> 01:10:32,600
(Tanner groaning)

1418
01:10:37,404 --> 01:10:38,404
Fuck you.

1419
01:10:40,775 --> 01:10:43,511
This game is survival, life
and death.

1420
01:10:47,048 --> 01:10:48,616
You know the rules.

1421
01:10:49,584 --> 01:10:52,319
(ominous music)

1422
01:10:59,961 --> 01:11:01,562
Tanner!

1423
01:11:01,596 --> 01:11:02,596
Tanner!

1424
01:11:07,769 --> 01:11:09,036
Come on, Tanner.

1425
01:11:11,873 --> 01:11:13,741
Okay, freeze bitch.

1426
01:11:14,609 --> 01:11:15,576
Don't shoot,

1427
01:11:15,610 --> 01:11:17,078
I'm unarmed.

1428
01:11:17,111 --> 01:11:19,312
He was torturing me for hours.

1429
01:11:19,346 --> 01:11:20,648
Thank goodness you found me.

1430
01:11:21,682 --> 01:11:22,950
It was horrible.

1431
01:11:22,984 --> 01:11:24,752
He had me tied up in that
control room.

1432
01:11:24,786 --> 01:11:26,353
Did you see his face?

1433
01:11:26,386 --> 01:11:29,557
No, he wore a mess the entire
time.

1434
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:32,325
Listen, you're gonna be okay.

1435
01:11:34,361 --> 01:11:35,361
No, it's not.

1436
01:11:36,564 --> 01:11:39,767
(Rachel screams)

1437
01:11:39,801 --> 01:11:42,770
Holy sweet Jesus, you're Rachel,

1438
01:11:44,038 --> 01:11:45,673
the one we've been looking for.

1439
01:11:47,642 --> 01:11:48,642
Hey, it's me.

1440
01:11:49,376 --> 01:11:51,979
Listen, I need a medic and
ambulance,

1441
01:11:52,013 --> 01:11:54,481
warehouse district right away.

1442
01:11:54,515 --> 01:11:55,448
Do you copy?

1443
01:11:55,482 --> 01:11:57,785
[Warden] How's it
going, Detective Casey?

1444
01:11:58,786 --> 01:11:59,887
Who the fuck is this?

1445
01:12:01,088 --> 01:12:02,623
[Warden] The guy with a
nickname.

1446
01:12:02,657 --> 01:12:04,892
Come on now, you know who this
is.

1447
01:12:04,926 --> 01:12:06,727
Where are you, asshole?

1448
01:12:06,761 --> 01:12:10,363
So this is the button
for the siren, huh?

1449
01:12:15,603 --> 01:12:16,804
He's in my fucking car.

1450
01:12:18,072 --> 01:12:21,843
All right listen, I'll get you
to the hospital myself, okay.

1451
01:12:23,044 --> 01:12:25,746
Take care of this asshole, all
right.

1452
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:26,948
I'll take care of you.

1453
01:12:40,493 --> 01:12:41,493
How?

1454
01:12:49,904 --> 01:12:52,840
There's one thing I learned
today

1455
01:12:59,180 --> 01:13:00,915
is to never give up.

1456
01:13:03,117 --> 01:13:04,051
At the end of the three rounds

1457
01:13:04,085 --> 01:13:06,587
the individual most
liked will be unleashed.

1458
01:13:06,621 --> 01:13:09,456
You will have 15 seconds
to perform your penance.

1459
01:13:09,489 --> 01:13:11,993
Round one begins now.

1460
01:13:12,026 --> 01:13:14,962
(Rachel screaming)

1461
01:13:33,714 --> 01:13:36,817
(electricity buzzing)

1462
01:13:58,105 --> 01:13:59,173
(Rachel screams)

1463
01:13:59,206 --> 01:14:00,473
(glass shattering)

1464
01:14:00,508 --> 01:14:01,208
No.

1465
01:14:01,242 --> 01:14:02,877
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1466
01:14:05,613 --> 01:14:06,847
You got to die.

1467
01:14:09,183 --> 01:14:10,217
Die.

1468
01:14:10,251 --> 01:14:13,054
(fire explosion)

1469
01:14:20,861 --> 01:14:21,861
Please.

1470
01:14:22,697 --> 01:14:24,665
I'm sorry.

1471
01:14:24,699 --> 01:14:26,100
I'm sorry, please.

1472
01:14:29,303 --> 01:14:30,771
I'm sorry too.

1473
01:14:32,106 --> 01:14:33,874
(woman wailing)

1474
01:14:33,908 --> 01:14:36,944
(gun shot)

1475
01:14:36,978 --> 01:14:38,746
Where the hell are you, bastard?

1476
01:14:38,779 --> 01:14:40,114
Now, now, detective.

1477
01:14:40,147 --> 01:14:41,882
That would be telling.

1478
01:14:41,916 --> 01:14:43,718
I say we put a pin in it

1479
01:14:43,751 --> 01:14:45,152
until the rematch.

1480
01:14:45,186 --> 01:14:47,154
Where the fuck are you?

1481
01:14:47,188 --> 01:14:48,289
I'm gonna get you, man.

1482
01:14:48,322 --> 01:14:51,726
(police siren ringing)

1483
01:14:56,330 --> 01:14:59,066
(ominous music)

1484
01:15:04,171 --> 01:15:05,973
(siren ringing)

1485
01:15:06,007 --> 01:15:08,009
Hey, the hell is this?

1486
01:15:09,977 --> 01:15:12,780
(chain clanking)

1487
01:15:16,017 --> 01:15:17,017
The hell am I?

1488
01:15:21,322 --> 01:15:22,590
(door banging)

1489
01:15:22,623 --> 01:15:23,958
Son of a bitch.

1490
01:15:23,991 --> 01:15:25,292
Oh my God.

1491
01:15:25,326 --> 01:15:27,962
Please, please.

1492
01:15:27,995 --> 01:15:29,263
(chain clanking)

1493
01:15:29,296 --> 01:15:30,965
Is anybody there?

1494
01:15:30,998 --> 01:15:32,733
Look, my family's rich.

1495
01:15:32,767 --> 01:15:34,101
(woman groaning)

1496
01:15:34,135 --> 01:15:35,236
(chain clanking)

1497
01:15:35,269 --> 01:15:36,871
Oh.

1498
01:15:36,904 --> 01:15:37,738
Hey.

1499
01:15:37,772 --> 01:15:38,973
No more fooling around.

1500
01:15:39,006 --> 01:15:40,141
Get me the fuck out of here.

1501
01:15:40,174 --> 01:15:42,109
(chain clanking)

1502
01:15:42,143 --> 01:15:42,977
Why me?

1503
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:44,111
What did I do wrong?

1504
01:15:44,145 --> 01:15:44,979
Come on.

1505
01:15:45,012 --> 01:15:45,846
Speak to me.

1506
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,090
Listen, you don't have to lock
me up.

1507
01:15:47,114 --> 01:15:50,284
Whoever's doing this better
let me the fuck go right now

1508
01:15:50,317 --> 01:15:53,621
or I'm gonna twist off your
stupid head.

1509
01:15:53,654 --> 01:15:55,189
(man wailing)

1510
01:15:55,222 --> 01:15:57,758
I can be an asset to you.

1511
01:15:57,792 --> 01:15:59,026
I can help you.

1512
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:01,996
And use your skull to
crush those teeny tiny

1513
01:16:02,029 --> 01:16:02,997
nuts of yours.

1514
01:16:03,030 --> 01:16:07,668
Let me go and I swear
I will not tell anyone,

1515
01:16:07,701 --> 01:16:08,701
I promise.

1516
01:16:13,874 --> 01:16:16,644
I don't want to die here.

1517
01:16:16,677 --> 01:16:18,712
Come on. Let's negotiate.

1518
01:16:18,746 --> 01:16:19,780
Anything you want.

1519
01:16:19,814 --> 01:16:21,348
(woman screaming)

1520
01:16:21,382 --> 01:16:23,017
(man wailing)

1521
01:16:23,050 --> 01:16:24,051
What is this?

1522
01:16:24,085 --> 01:16:25,119
A game.

1523
01:16:25,152 --> 01:16:28,289
(static interference)

1524
01:16:30,357 --> 01:16:33,094
(siren ringing)

1525
01:16:35,229 --> 01:16:39,066
Ladies and gentlemen allow
me to introduce myself.

1526
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:42,169
I am the Warden and I
have gathered you all here

1527
01:16:42,203 --> 01:16:44,371
to participate in a little game

1528
01:16:44,405 --> 01:16:49,009
and like most games, the rules
are simply not in your favor.

1529
01:16:50,377 --> 01:16:53,114
(ominous music)

1530
01:17:00,054 --> 01:17:00,888
I can't stop watching.

1531
01:17:00,921 --> 01:17:03,324
I mean, I can't...

1532
01:17:03,357 --> 01:17:04,158
I can't look away from it.

1533
01:17:04,191 --> 01:17:06,727
I can't push myself away from
it.

1534
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:08,963
I find the whole thing truly
disgusting,

1535
01:17:08,996 --> 01:17:11,132
degrading, irreprehensible.

1536
01:17:11,165 --> 01:17:12,166
I think it's fake.

1537
01:17:14,235 --> 01:17:17,037
I think everything in the
world is fake nowadays.

1538
01:17:18,339 --> 01:17:21,308
You can't believe
anything you see anymore.

1539
01:17:21,342 --> 01:17:23,844
That got me thinking,
you know, it's like,

1540
01:17:23,878 --> 01:17:25,846
what does that say about me

1541
01:17:27,248 --> 01:17:28,749
as a human being.

1542
01:17:28,782 --> 01:17:30,050
It's truly sickening

1543
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:35,189
but I can't stop watching.

1544
01:17:35,222 --> 01:17:36,724
I would just turn it off.

1545
01:17:37,958 --> 01:17:38,958
Just turn it off.

1546
01:17:42,997 --> 01:17:44,431
If you can.

1547
01:17:44,465 --> 01:17:47,201
(ominous music)
