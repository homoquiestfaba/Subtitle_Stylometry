- (groans)

2
00:00:10,726 --> 00:00:12,560
Robb!

00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:14,429
(wailing)

00:00:19,235 --> 00:00:21,235

00:00:39,955 --> 00:00:41,223
(screeching)

8
00:00:41,257 --> 00:00:42,857
Season three begins with us

9
00:00:42,892 --> 00:00:45,660
very much heading
in the right direction.

10
00:00:45,694 --> 00:00:47,562
(screeches)

11
00:00:47,597 --> 00:00:49,697
<i>The dragons have got</i>
<i>a bit bigger.</i>

12
00:00:49,732 --> 00:00:53,268
<i>And you're starting to see
what they'll end up becoming.</i>

13
00:00:53,302 --> 00:00:56,571
We're headed to Astapor because we've
got our ships and now we need an army.

14
00:00:56,606 --> 00:00:59,507
Some say the Unsullied are the
greatest soldiers in the world.

15
00:00:59,542 --> 00:01:01,309
The greatest slave
soldiers in the world.

16
00:01:01,344 --> 00:01:03,545
She debates
whether the Unsullied

17
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:06,581
would truly be behind her
because she's paid them to.

18
00:01:06,615 --> 00:01:10,118
Once I own an army of
slaves, what will I be?

19
00:01:10,186 --> 00:01:12,921
Pyat Pree has sent a warlock
to try and kill me.

20
00:01:12,955 --> 00:01:15,757
<i>And I'm saved by</i>
<i>Ser Barristan Selmy.</i>

21
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,792
The honor is mine, my queen.

22
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,994
Clarke: <i> He pledges
allegiance to me</i>

23
00:01:20,029 --> 00:01:22,297
because he was head
of the Kingsguard

24
00:01:22,331 --> 00:01:23,598
<i>for my father.</i>

25
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:25,767
I have been searching for
you, Daenerys Stormborn,

26
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:29,203
to ask your forgiveness.
I will not fail you again.

27
00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:33,207
Ygritte's taking him
to meet Mance Rayder.

28
00:01:33,242 --> 00:01:36,978
And this is going straight
into enemy territory.

29
00:01:37,012 --> 00:01:39,848
He doesn't rate his chances
of survival particularly high.

30
00:01:39,882 --> 00:01:42,517
Don't look so grim, Jon Snow.

31
00:01:42,551 --> 00:01:45,253
If Mance Rayder likes you,
you'll live another day.

32
00:01:45,287 --> 00:01:46,888
And if he don't...

33
00:01:46,922 --> 00:01:50,158
When Jon first walks into
Mance's camp, he meets Tormund.

34
00:01:50,192 --> 00:01:52,527
What do we want
with a baby crow?

35
00:01:52,562 --> 00:01:54,729
This «baby» killed
Qhorin Halfhand.

36
00:01:54,763 --> 00:01:56,798
Harington: <i> Mance is
a legendary figure.</i>

37
00:01:56,832 --> 00:01:58,333
He used to be part
of the Night's Watch.

38
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:00,468
Why do you want to join us?

39
00:02:00,503 --> 00:02:02,570
I saw Craster take
his own baby boy

40
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:04,906
and leave it in the woods.
I saw what took it.

41
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,309
And why would that make
you desert your brothers?

42
00:02:07,343 --> 00:02:10,912
I want to fight for the side
that fights for the living.

43
00:02:10,946 --> 00:02:14,082
Do you know how long it's going to
take us to get to King's Landing

44
00:02:14,116 --> 00:02:16,651
- walking through fields and forests?
- Yes.

45
00:02:16,686 --> 00:02:18,527
One thing Jaime
is very good at,

46
00:02:18,554 --> 00:02:21,155
he's very good at sniffing
out people's weaknesses.

47
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:24,592
- Move.
-<i> He wants her to lose it with him</i>

48
00:02:24,627 --> 00:02:26,361
so that he will get
the opportunity

49
00:02:26,395 --> 00:02:28,763
<i>to get out of his chains</i>
<i>and get rid of her.</i>

50
00:02:28,797 --> 00:02:30,638
And then they reach this bridge

51
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:33,134
<i>and finally</i>
<i>he gets the opportunity.</i>

52
00:02:33,201 --> 00:02:35,103
Ah!

53
00:02:39,107 --> 00:02:42,677
And unbelievable. He goes
from one bad situation

54
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:44,379
<i>to a horrible situation.</i>

55
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:47,215
<i>So we have the wonderful</i>
<i>Locke appear.</i>

56
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:49,618
Let us go, my father will pay
you whatever you want.

57
00:02:49,652 --> 00:02:52,020
Enough to buy me a new head?

58
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,426
Season three starts with Robb really
just wanting to fight someone.

59
00:02:58,461 --> 00:03:02,330
<i>And they get to Harrenhal and,
again, he can't fight anyone.</i>

60
00:03:02,365 --> 00:03:04,799
And worse than that,
the people loyal to him

61
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:08,737
<i>have been slaughtered</i>
<i>in the most horrific way.</i>

62
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,038
Find her a chamber
that will serve as a cell.

63
00:03:11,106 --> 00:03:12,406
Talisa:
<i>She's your mother.</i>

64
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:14,342
Robb: <i> She freed
Jaime Lannister.</i>

65
00:03:14,377 --> 00:03:16,244
<i>The Lannisters robbed</i>
<i>them of their sons.</i>

66
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,145
And she robbed them
of their justice.

67
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,015
When we arrive,
I get the message

68
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:23,918
<i>that Winterfell,</i>
<i>after being taken by Theon,</i>

69
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,453
<i>has now been</i>
<i>burned to the ground</i>

70
00:03:25,488 --> 00:03:28,423
<i>and it looks like Bran</i>
<i>and Rickon may be dead.</i>

71
00:03:28,457 --> 00:03:31,959
By the time Bolton's bastard got to
Winterfell, the Ironborn were gone.

72
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:34,296
<i>They massacred everyone and
put the castle to the torch.</i>

73
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,397
And Bran and Rickon
have not been found.

74
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:38,533
Bran and Rickon
have fled Winterfell

75
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:40,134
and no one has heard from them.

76
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:42,503
But there's a brother
and a sister that come.

77
00:03:42,571 --> 00:03:44,071
I'm Jojen Reed.

78
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:45,974
<i>This is my sister Meera.</i>

79
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:47,575
We've come a long way
to find you, Brandon.

80
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,844
Fairley: <i> They realize
he has this power,</i>

81
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:51,679
but he doesn't know
anything about it.

82
00:03:51,714 --> 00:03:53,782
And we have much farther to go.

83
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:57,685
So it's about educating him so that he
can actually become what he becomes.

84
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,421
Theon may have taken them back
to the Iron Islands as hostages.

85
00:04:00,455 --> 00:04:03,157
Have you heard anything
from Theon at all?

86
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,596
- What's your name?
- Theon Greyjoy.

87
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:14,469
What is your name?

88
00:04:14,503 --> 00:04:15,770
Reek.

89
00:04:15,804 --> 00:04:19,007
My name is Reek.

90
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,676
Maisie Williams: <i> First of
all, they're in the woods</i>

91
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,277
<i>trying to find her family.</i>

92
00:04:23,312 --> 00:04:26,113
Not necessarily home,
just somewhere

93
00:04:26,148 --> 00:04:27,982
where she thinks
her family may be.

94
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,885
<i>And they come across</i>
<i>the Brotherhood.</i>

95
00:04:32,104 --> 00:04:33,864
They don't know who she is.

96
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:35,590
<i>They don't really want</i>
<i>anything to do with her.</i>

97
00:04:35,624 --> 00:04:37,325
You can finish your meals
before you go.

98
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,060
- You'll free us?
- I give you my word.

99
00:04:39,094 --> 00:04:41,362
Rory McCann: <i> The Hound had
been drinking too much.</i>

100
00:04:41,396 --> 00:04:43,131
We know he's an angry man
and a bit lost.

101
00:04:43,165 --> 00:04:44,532
I mean, where's
the Hound gonna go?

102
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:46,801
<i>So I think he was found</i>
<i>drunk under a tree</i>

103
00:04:46,836 --> 00:04:48,770
<i>with not all his wits</i>
<i>about him.</i>

104
00:04:48,837 --> 00:04:51,572
Just as she's this close
from the door,

105
00:04:51,606 --> 00:04:54,108
-<i> the Hound recognizes who she is.</i>
- Girl.

106
00:04:54,142 --> 00:04:56,410
Then tells the rest of
the Brotherhood who she is.

107
00:04:56,445 --> 00:05:00,414
What in seven hells are you
doing with the Stark bitch?

108
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:06,620
Sansa finds a new friend
in season three. Margaery.

109
00:05:06,655 --> 00:05:09,490
It is my honor
to present my grandmother,

110
00:05:09,524 --> 00:05:12,960
the Lady Olenna
of House Tyrell.

111
00:05:12,995 --> 00:05:14,963
Pretty much as soon
as she's introduced to them,

112
00:05:14,997 --> 00:05:16,298
<i>they talk about Joffrey.</i>

113
00:05:16,332 --> 00:05:18,766
I want you to tell me the truth

114
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:22,404
about this royal boy,
this Joffrey.

115
00:05:22,438 --> 00:05:25,039
Sansa tells them
what he's really like.

116
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:28,109
- He's a monster.
- Ah.

117
00:05:28,143 --> 00:05:29,644
<i>That's a pity.</i>

118
00:05:29,678 --> 00:05:31,880
- Tell me what you think of her.
- Who?

119
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,282
- Margaery.
-<i> She's an ideal match.</i>

120
00:05:34,317 --> 00:05:37,585
With the Tyrells beside us,
we'll crush the northerners.

121
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,121
The new relationship
between Margaery and Joffrey,

122
00:05:40,155 --> 00:05:41,923
<i>I think, scares Cersei a lot.</i>

123
00:05:41,947 --> 00:05:43,467
Cersei's really threatened
by Margaery.

124
00:05:43,492 --> 00:05:45,727
She's younger
and she's more beautiful.

125
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:47,261
She's very smart.

126
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:50,064
But Cersei sees all that.
She knows she's a game player.

127
00:05:50,098 --> 00:05:52,367
She married a traitor
and known degenerate

128
00:05:52,401 --> 00:05:53,935
like Renly Baratheon
for a reason.

129
00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:57,338
She married Renly Baratheon
because she was told to.

130
00:05:57,372 --> 00:06:00,742
That's what intelligent women
do — what they're told.

131
00:06:00,776 --> 00:06:02,944
This is what these seasons
are becoming about —

132
00:06:02,978 --> 00:06:05,947
is her loss of that one
thing that kept her sane.

133
00:06:05,981 --> 00:06:08,115
Because she believes him — you
know, he's gonna be the next king

134
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,884
and she would reign
through him.

135
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:13,355
The Lord of Harrenhal will make a
worthy suitor for the Widow Arryn.

136
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:15,422
For which I am
extremely grateful to you.

137
00:06:15,457 --> 00:06:17,491
You will leave for the Eyrie
soon as possible

138
00:06:17,526 --> 00:06:19,527
and bring Lysa Arryn
into the fold.

139
00:06:19,562 --> 00:06:21,595
Peter Dinklage: <i> Tywin wants
to secure everything.</i>

140
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,265
And he figured Littlefinger
would be a great person

141
00:06:24,299 --> 00:06:26,267
to go up there and take charge.

142
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:28,603
Littlefinger:<i> Lady Arryn and I have known
each other since we were children.</i>

143
00:06:28,637 --> 00:06:31,205
She has always been

144
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,808
positively predisposed
toward me.

145
00:06:33,842 --> 00:06:36,077
Tyrion:
<i>But Lord Baelish's absence</i>

146
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:38,212
<i>would present certain problems.</i>

147
00:06:38,246 --> 00:06:40,582
The royal wedding may end up

148
00:06:40,616 --> 00:06:43,136
being the most expensive
event in living memory.

149
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:46,187
Not a good time to leave the
crown's finances unattended.

150
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:49,457
Which is why I'm naming
you new Master of Coin.

151
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,227
Dinklage: <i> They sort of don't
really recognize Tyrion</i>

152
00:06:53,261 --> 00:06:56,931
as being so instrumental
in saving King's Landing.

153
00:06:56,966 --> 00:06:59,100
The rebels came
for Joffrey's head.

154
00:06:59,134 --> 00:07:01,469
They lost their own,
thanks to Father.

155
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,138
Thanks to Father.

156
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,740
The Unsullied,

157
00:07:05,774 --> 00:07:08,042
who are fundamentally
a slave army,

158
00:07:08,076 --> 00:07:11,012
<i>do exactly as they're told.</i>

159
00:07:11,046 --> 00:07:12,113
When she meets the Unsullied,

160
00:07:12,147 --> 00:07:15,883
<i>she realizes that she will</i>
<i>take the Unsullied</i>

161
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:17,986
<i>if only to save them.</i>

162
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,454
There's a small amount
of bartering that goes on

163
00:07:20,489 --> 00:07:22,156
<i>until she kind of pulls out</i>
<i>the ace of spades.</i>

164
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:25,259
I have dragons.
I'll give you one.

165
00:07:25,294 --> 00:07:27,494
When she hands over the dragon,

166
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:29,631
<i>she swaps the dragon</i>
<i>for the whip,</i>

167
00:07:29,665 --> 00:07:31,433
which means
that she's the master.

168
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:34,736
So she tells them they need
to kill all of the slavers.

169
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,104
(speaking Valyrian)

170
00:07:42,978 --> 00:07:44,545
Dracarys.

171
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:46,314
(screaming)

172
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,252
(screeches)

173
00:07:51,286 --> 00:07:52,454
Tormund:
<i>Orell.</i>

174
00:07:52,521 --> 00:07:53,755
Harington:
<i>Orell is a warg</i>

175
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:55,256
and he can look
through the eyes

176
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,091
<i>of his animal,</i>
<i>which is an eagle.</i>

177
00:07:57,126 --> 00:08:00,261
He reports back that
he's seen dead crows

178
00:08:00,295 --> 00:08:02,096
at the Fist of the First Men.

179
00:08:02,097 --> 00:08:04,532
<i>When we reach</i>
<i>the Fist of the First Men,</i>

180
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,068
<i>we discover that there's</i>
<i>a kind of horrific pattern</i>

181
00:08:07,102 --> 00:08:09,603
<i>of dead horses</i>
<i>that's been made.</i>

182
00:08:09,638 --> 00:08:13,508
And Mance is quick to point out that
this is the work of the white walkers.

183
00:08:13,542 --> 00:08:15,409
Always the artists.

184
00:08:15,443 --> 00:08:18,279
Mance decides
that Jon should go

185
00:08:18,313 --> 00:08:20,381
with the climbing party
over the Wall

186
00:08:20,415 --> 00:08:22,450
<i>for the basic reason</i>
<i>that Jon knows</i>

187
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:24,351
<i>more about the Wall</i>
<i>than anybody else.</i>

188
00:08:24,386 --> 00:08:28,256
If he's useful, good. If
not, throw him off the Wall.

189
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,451
See if crows can fly.

190
00:08:30,902 --> 00:08:32,703
These men, all these soldiers,

191
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:35,063
<i>they've been on the road</i>
<i>for God knows how long.</i>

192
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,298
<i>And now suddenly</i>
<i>they have this woman.</i>

193
00:08:37,332 --> 00:08:39,533
Jaime knows what's going to happen.
He knows before it happens.

194
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:42,103
<i>But then when it does happen,</i>

195
00:08:42,137 --> 00:08:45,539
he, for some reason —
I think it surprises himself —

196
00:08:45,573 --> 00:08:48,910
he can't just stand by,
so he makes up this story.

197
00:08:48,944 --> 00:08:50,812
Her father
is Lord Selwyn Tarth.

198
00:08:50,846 --> 00:08:53,915
Lord Selwyn would pay
his daughter's weight

199
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:56,183
in sapphires
if she's returned to him.

200
00:08:56,218 --> 00:08:58,319
Coster-Waldau:
<i>So Locke thinks about that</i>

201
00:08:58,353 --> 00:09:01,923
<i>and his greed is stronger</i>
<i>than his lust, I guess.</i>

202
00:09:01,957 --> 00:09:04,191
So he takes it out
on Jaime instead.

203
00:09:05,994 --> 00:09:08,162
(screaming)

204
00:09:08,196 --> 00:09:11,365
Madden: <i> We get the news
that Robb's grandfather</i>

205
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,434
<i>is dead at Riverrun.</i>

206
00:09:13,468 --> 00:09:16,137
Robb's very much aware
that he needs the army

207
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:18,706
<i>that his mother's</i>
<i>family command as well.</i>

208
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,441
<i>So they set off</i>
<i>to go to Riverrun</i>

209
00:09:20,475 --> 00:09:22,544
<i>for the funeral</i>
<i>of his grandfather</i>

210
00:09:22,578 --> 00:09:24,145
and to discuss
what happens next.

211
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:25,813
<i>And when we get there,</i>

212
00:09:25,848 --> 00:09:28,115
<i>Robb meets again the Blackfish</i>

213
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,517
<i>and Edmure, Catelyn's brother.</i>

214
00:09:30,552 --> 00:09:33,387
Edmure has come up with
two Lannister prisoners.

215
00:09:33,455 --> 00:09:35,489
Edmure: <i>Willem Lannister.
Martyn Lannister.</i>

216
00:09:35,557 --> 00:09:37,759
Willem and Martyn Lannister
are 14 years old.

217
00:09:37,793 --> 00:09:39,560
Lord Karstark
takes it upon himself

218
00:09:39,594 --> 00:09:42,663
<i>during the night to slaughter</i>
<i>these two young boys</i>

219
00:09:42,697 --> 00:09:44,799
chained up in a prison cell.

220
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,901
<i>Robb understands</i>
<i>why he's done it,</i>

221
00:09:46,936 --> 00:09:49,470
<i>but as a king</i>
<i>and a just leader,</i>

222
00:09:49,504 --> 00:09:51,072
he can't allow that
to go unpunished.

223
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:53,841
Rickard Karstark,
I sentence you to die.

224
00:09:53,876 --> 00:09:55,877
(grunts)

225
00:09:55,911 --> 00:09:58,045
When Robb carries out
the sentence on Lord Karstark,

226
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,380
<i>Robb loses half his army.</i>

227
00:09:59,414 --> 00:10:01,315
The Karstarks are gone.

228
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,852
They need more men.
They need help.

229
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,121
He needs to make amends with people
he's betrayed, which is the Freys.

230
00:10:08,123 --> 00:10:10,792
But because of Robb's
breaking of his promise

231
00:10:10,826 --> 00:10:13,761
<i>by marrying Talisa</i>
<i>when he had been promised</i>

232
00:10:13,796 --> 00:10:16,063
to one of
Walder Frey's daughters,

233
00:10:16,098 --> 00:10:18,632
<i>they are very skeptical</i>

234
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,768
<i>about approaching Walder Frey.</i>

235
00:10:20,803 --> 00:10:22,003
And rightly so.

236
00:10:22,037 --> 00:10:25,740
<i>He sends two sons as an envoy.</i>

237
00:10:25,774 --> 00:10:28,376
And Walder Frey has said,
«Yes, we will help you.»

238
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:32,080
<i>But the sting in the tail</i>
<i>is that Edmure</i>

239
00:10:32,114 --> 00:10:34,916
must marry one
of Walder Frey's daughters.

240
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,719
- Could I see her first?
- You want to count her teeth?

241
00:10:37,753 --> 00:10:39,920
He's disgusted because
everybody in the land

242
00:10:39,954 --> 00:10:42,756
<i>knows that nobody</i>
<i>in any right mind</i>

243
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,658
would want to marry a Frey.

244
00:10:46,194 --> 00:10:49,563
The Brotherhood take her
to see their leader.

245
00:10:49,632 --> 00:10:52,166
His name is Beric Dondarrion.

246
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,368
Williams: <i> She's not
particularly happy about it,</i>

247
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:57,071
but they're not hurting us,
so it could be worse.

248
00:10:57,105 --> 00:11:00,974
You know, he's a knight, but
he's with all these guys in rags

249
00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:03,110
and they look like
a bunch of swineherds.

250
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:06,047
If you mean to murder me, then
bloody well get on with it.

251
00:11:06,081 --> 00:11:08,515
You'll die soon enough,
but it won't be murder.

252
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,317
For some bizarre reason,

253
00:11:10,352 --> 00:11:13,154
they choose a trial by combat.

254
00:11:13,188 --> 00:11:16,524
(grunting)

255
00:11:18,293 --> 00:11:21,395
Williams: <i> Beric gets a
sword down his shoulder</i>

256
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,066
and topples over
and «dies».

257
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,468
But somehow Beric Dondarrion

258
00:11:27,502 --> 00:11:30,004
<i>is born again</i>

259
00:11:30,038 --> 00:11:31,639
<i>with the help of Thoros.</i>

260
00:11:31,674 --> 00:11:34,075
It's really
pretty spooky stuff.

261
00:11:34,109 --> 00:11:35,776
How many times have you
brought me back?

262
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,445
It's the Lord of Light
that brings you back.

263
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:39,247
- How many times?
- This makes six.

264
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,682
What are you
going to do with me?

265
00:11:40,716 --> 00:11:42,083
At first light
we'll ride for Riverrun.

266
00:11:42,117 --> 00:11:43,785
<i>Your brother's there now.</i>

267
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:46,754
What have we here?
Frozen crows?

268
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,791
- We can talk inside.
- Can we?

269
00:11:49,825 --> 00:11:52,226
Harington: <i> Mormont and a
depleted group of other rangers</i>

270
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,462
make it back
to Craster's Keep alive.

271
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:57,365
You feed that pig
better than you feed us.

272
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:58,766
Pig's got value to me.

273
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,034
<i>(woman screams)</i>

274
00:12:00,068 --> 00:12:02,569
- What is it?
- (crying)

275
00:12:04,272 --> 00:12:06,807
It's at this point
the rebellion starts.

276
00:12:06,841 --> 00:12:08,776
(shouting)

277
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,644
I shall have your head.

278
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,448
We have to go<i> now!</i>

279
00:12:15,926 --> 00:12:17,727
I now am a woman on a mission.

280
00:12:17,752 --> 00:12:20,121
<i>I've saved 8,000 slaves</i>

281
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:24,458
<i>and I've got a thirst for
wanting to save more people.</i>

282
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,760
<i>So we move on to Yunkai.</i>

283
00:12:25,794 --> 00:12:28,596
The Yunkish train bed
slaves, not soldiers.

284
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,797
- We can defeat them.
- But they won't meet us on the field.

285
00:12:30,865 --> 00:12:32,833
Jorah:
<i>They have strong walls.</i>

286
00:12:32,867 --> 00:12:34,969
(speaking Valyrian)

287
00:12:37,706 --> 00:12:40,241
So I then set up camp

288
00:12:40,275 --> 00:12:43,878
<i>and hear the slavers of Yunkai,</i>

289
00:12:43,912 --> 00:12:45,513
<i>and I kind of lay down</i>
<i>the law for them.</i>

290
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:48,282
You will release
every slave in Yunkai.

291
00:12:48,317 --> 00:12:50,218
Reject this gift,

292
00:12:50,252 --> 00:12:52,520
and I shall show you no mercy.

293
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:53,955
You are mad.

294
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:57,190
We are not Astapor or Qarth.
We are Yunkai.

295
00:12:57,192 --> 00:13:00,161
Those who survive, we
shall enslave once more.

296
00:13:00,195 --> 00:13:02,429
Perhaps we'll make
a slave of you as well.

297
00:13:02,497 --> 00:13:04,632
(screeches)

298
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,100
Now get out.

299
00:13:07,135 --> 00:13:09,103
Clarke: <i> I give them a little bit
of a fright with the dragons,</i>

300
00:13:09,137 --> 00:13:11,272
And then I decide

301
00:13:11,306 --> 00:13:15,009
- that I'm going to kill them.
- (purring)

302
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:18,346
Harington: <i>Before Jon, Ygritte,
Tormund, and Orell climb the Wall,</i>

303
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,315
Ygritte sort of coerces Jon

304
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,484
<i>into a secret</i>
<i>place she knows...</i>

305
00:13:23,551 --> 00:13:25,085
Ygritte!

306
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,955
...and decides to really test
A) whether he's a crow,

307
00:13:27,989 --> 00:13:29,656
<i>and B) whether</i>
<i>he loves her.</i>

308
00:13:29,691 --> 00:13:31,859
I don't ever want to leave
this cave, Jon Snow.

309
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,528
Harington: <i> And Jon
does betray his vows.</i>

310
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:38,166
I think it's at that point that
he falls in love with Ygritte.

311
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,367
<i>It's a rare moment in the story</i>

312
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,470
where we have a purely happy
moment between two characters.

313
00:13:43,505 --> 00:13:47,074
<i>When Jon and the others</i>
<i>are climbing the Wall —</i>

314
00:13:47,109 --> 00:13:49,176
<i>which is 800 feet</i>
<i>of ice —</i>

315
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:51,545
a part of the Wall breaks off,

316
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,548
<i>leaving Jon dangling</i>
<i>on the end of a rope</i>

317
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,583
<i>as well as Ygritte.</i>

318
00:13:56,618 --> 00:13:58,385
<i>And it's only</i>
<i>right at the last minute</i>

319
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,388
that Jon manages
to save them both.

320
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:03,324
(horse whinnies)

321
00:14:03,392 --> 00:14:05,726
Finally they get
to Harrenhal, the castle.

322
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,230
Lord Bolton, I give you
the Kingslayer.

323
00:14:09,264 --> 00:14:11,565
We have a dinner
with Roose Bolton.

324
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:14,202
Roose: <i> I will allow you
to go to King's Landing</i>

325
00:14:14,236 --> 00:14:17,104
as restitution for the
mistakes my soldiers made.

326
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:18,905
<i>And you will swear</i>
<i>to tell your father</i>

327
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,874
<i>that I had nothing to do</i>
<i>with your maiming.</i>

328
00:14:20,909 --> 00:14:24,211
- My lady.
- She won't be going with you.

329
00:14:24,246 --> 00:14:27,515
Jaime leaves Harrenhal. He leaves
with a bad taste in his mouth.

330
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:29,250
<i>I'm leaving her with Locke.</i>

331
00:14:29,284 --> 00:14:31,719
Don't you worry
about your friend.

332
00:14:31,753 --> 00:14:33,920
<i>We'll take good care of her.</i>

333
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:35,756
But then on the road,
he finds out

334
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,025
that it's only a matter of time
and they're gonna kill her.

335
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,427
<i>And he again surprises himself,</i>

336
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,296
the way he so wants
to just not care.

337
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,865
- (crowd cheering)
- (roars)

338
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:46,634
But he does and he goes back.

339
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:49,971
I'm taking her to King's Landing.
Unless you kill me.

340
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:54,041
Well, let's be on our way.

341
00:14:54,109 --> 00:14:56,244
Spotted a Lannister
raiding party.

342
00:14:56,278 --> 00:14:58,445
- How far?
- Less than a day's ride south.

343
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,980
Time for a lion hunt.

344
00:15:00,014 --> 00:15:01,582
They say: «oh, we're gonna go

345
00:15:01,616 --> 00:15:04,385
and kill some Lannisters
and then we'll take you home.»

346
00:15:04,452 --> 00:15:06,753
- I swear to you, this isn't —
- You're a liar!

347
00:15:06,788 --> 00:15:09,290
They're all distracted getting on
their armor and things like that,

348
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:13,060
<i>so she sees her opportunity</i>
<i>and she goes for it.</i>

349
00:15:13,094 --> 00:15:15,563
- Anguy, bring her back.
- Come back, girl.

350
00:15:15,597 --> 00:15:18,632
Williams: <i> Then gets
stopped by the Hound.</i>

351
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,501
(muffled screaming)

352
00:15:20,535 --> 00:15:21,975
Kick all you like, wolf girl.

353
00:15:22,003 --> 00:15:24,405
Won't do you no good.

354
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:27,108
He sees a chance of using Arya

355
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:28,842
<i>as a bargaining chip.</i>

356
00:15:28,877 --> 00:15:30,277
Is that the Blackwater?

357
00:15:30,312 --> 00:15:33,447
That's the Red Fork.
I'm taking you to the Twins.

358
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:35,949
Your uncle is marrying
one of the Frey girls.

359
00:15:35,984 --> 00:15:38,286
Your mother and brother
will be there

360
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,920
and they'll pay me for you.

361
00:15:39,954 --> 00:15:42,756
So a great road trip begins.

362
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:46,860
Littlefinger comes along
and he says to Sansa

363
00:15:46,895 --> 00:15:49,663
<i>he's got a ship and he could</i>
<i>take her with him.</i>

364
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,499
Please, Lord Baelish, tell me what to do.
Tell me when.

365
00:15:52,567 --> 00:15:55,569
She yet again thinks
she's gonna get out of here.

366
00:15:55,603 --> 00:15:57,138
You must see Highgarden.

367
00:15:57,172 --> 00:15:59,507
I don't think the queen would
let me leave King's Landing.

368
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,842
Margaery wants to marry
Sansa off

369
00:16:01,876 --> 00:16:04,244
to her brother Loras Tyrell...

370
00:16:04,312 --> 00:16:06,013
Once I marry Joffrey,
I'll be queen.

371
00:16:06,047 --> 00:16:09,850
And if you were
to marry Loras...

372
00:16:09,884 --> 00:16:12,186
...which Sansa is over
the moon about.

373
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,389
<i>She's getting married to</i>
<i>a guy that's actually nice.</i>

374
00:16:15,423 --> 00:16:17,124
The Tyrells are plotting

375
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:19,560
to marry Sansa Stark
to Ser Loras.

376
00:16:19,594 --> 00:16:22,730
We need to find Sansa Stark
a different husband.

377
00:16:22,764 --> 00:16:25,432
He tells Tyrion he's gonna marry
Sansa, which I find hilarious.

378
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:27,368
<i>Then, kind of within</i>
<i>the same breath,</i>

379
00:16:27,402 --> 00:16:30,437
lets me know that I'll be
marrying Margaery's brother.

380
00:16:30,472 --> 00:16:32,940
Tyrion will do as he's
bid, as will you.

381
00:16:32,974 --> 00:16:35,042
- What do you mean?
- You'll marry Ser Loras.

382
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,843
- I will not.
- Yes, you will.

383
00:16:36,878 --> 00:16:38,679
This arranged marriage to Sansa

384
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,581
<i>doesn't go over very well.</i>

385
00:16:40,615 --> 00:16:42,416
<i>She doesn't like</i>
<i>that news at all.</i>

386
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,785
She wasn't gonna go
on Littlefinger's ship

387
00:16:44,819 --> 00:16:46,687
<i>because she was being</i>
<i>married to Loras.</i>

388
00:16:46,721 --> 00:16:48,422
<i>Now Littlefinger sailed away,</i>

389
00:16:48,456 --> 00:16:50,391
she's getting married
to Tyrion,

390
00:16:50,425 --> 00:16:52,225
who she didn't want
to get married to.

391
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:55,496
So, am I invited
to your wedding?

392
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,599
Shae is pretty gutted
about this marriage to Tyrion.

393
00:16:58,633 --> 00:17:01,301
Especially now that
she's Sansa's handmaiden.

394
00:17:01,335 --> 00:17:03,103
Listen to me, my lady.

395
00:17:03,137 --> 00:17:05,739
I'm not your lady.
I'm your whore.

396
00:17:05,773 --> 00:17:07,441
Dinklage:
<i>He's vulnerable, Tyrion.</i>

397
00:17:07,475 --> 00:17:10,778
And that's very
frightening to him.

398
00:17:10,845 --> 00:17:14,181
The wedding to Tyrion,
in Sansa's eyes,

399
00:17:14,216 --> 00:17:16,383
<i>it was the worst day</i>
<i>of her life.</i>

400
00:17:16,418 --> 00:17:18,686
He's a Lannister.
She's not gonna trust him.

401
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,388
Joffrey, of course,
takes great glee

402
00:17:20,422 --> 00:17:22,389
<i>in this new relationship</i>

403
00:17:22,424 --> 00:17:25,091
and torments both of them
as he usually does.

404
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:28,195
Time for the bedding ceremony.

405
00:17:28,229 --> 00:17:30,331
There will be no
bedding ceremony.

406
00:17:30,365 --> 00:17:32,833
There will be if I command it.

407
00:17:34,936 --> 00:17:38,039
Tywin: I'm sure Tyrion did not
mean to threaten the king.

408
00:17:38,073 --> 00:17:41,142
Your uncle is clearly
quite drunk, Your Grace.

409
00:17:41,176 --> 00:17:42,843
Stop.

410
00:17:42,877 --> 00:17:44,345
But your father —

411
00:17:44,379 --> 00:17:47,181
I won't share your bed.
Not until you want me to.

412
00:17:47,215 --> 00:17:49,115
What if I never want you to?

413
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,518
And so my watch begins.

414
00:17:53,388 --> 00:17:55,889
(screeches)

415
00:17:55,924 --> 00:17:58,024
Only one old man
and eight good horses.

416
00:17:58,059 --> 00:17:59,427
Let's carve him up.

417
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:01,528
We just take the horses and go.

418
00:18:01,563 --> 00:18:03,030
The old man's no threat.

419
00:18:03,097 --> 00:18:04,364
There's a storm coming.

420
00:18:04,398 --> 00:18:06,634
<i>(thunder rumbles)</i>

421
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,829
It's as good a place
to shelter as any.

422
00:18:11,806 --> 00:18:13,740
-<i> I yield.</i>
- Wildlings.

423
00:18:13,775 --> 00:18:16,810
Harington: <i> Bran and
Rickon and Osha and Hodor</i>

424
00:18:16,878 --> 00:18:19,713
are in the windmill
that is just by where Jon is.

425
00:18:19,747 --> 00:18:21,214
Their paths
just miss each other.

426
00:18:21,249 --> 00:18:23,584
<i>Neither of them know</i>
<i>that they're there.</i>

427
00:18:23,618 --> 00:18:25,953
Cut his throat or he'll tell
the crows we're here.

428
00:18:25,987 --> 00:18:27,828
Harington: <i> The man, you
know, has to be killed</i>

429
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:31,492
and Orell suggests that it
should be Jon who does it

430
00:18:31,526 --> 00:18:33,594
<i>to prove that he's one of them.</i>

431
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:40,166
- Kill him.
- (grunts)

432
00:18:40,201 --> 00:18:42,403
Orell and Tormund
are about to kill Jon

433
00:18:42,437 --> 00:18:44,838
<i>when two direwolves attack.</i>

434
00:18:44,872 --> 00:18:47,941
<i>It's Bran who goes into</i>
<i>his warg mode</i>

435
00:18:47,975 --> 00:18:51,545
and into Summer to attack
the wildlings and save Jon.

436
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,382
- (growling)
- (screams)

437
00:18:55,449 --> 00:18:57,318
- (grunts)
- (groans)

438
00:18:57,352 --> 00:18:59,353
(screeching)

439
00:19:04,203 --> 00:19:06,803
Madden: <i> When we
arrive at the Freys',</i>

440
00:19:06,828 --> 00:19:09,530
<i>Lord Frey wants to make sure</i>
<i>that this wedding happens</i>

441
00:19:09,564 --> 00:19:12,265
here and now
before we go back to war.

442
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,502
Or so that's what
we're led to believe.

443
00:19:14,536 --> 00:19:16,570
If you think the time
is right, Lord Walder,

444
00:19:16,604 --> 00:19:18,672
by all means, let us bed them.

445
00:19:18,707 --> 00:19:21,408
As the bedding party exits,

446
00:19:21,443 --> 00:19:23,210
<i>the lights dim.</i>

447
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,546
Then, literally,
as the door closes,

448
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,514
<i>the band strike up.</i>

449
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:29,316
<i>And that is what makes</i>
<i>Catelyn turn around</i>

450
00:19:29,351 --> 00:19:31,051
<i>and think,</i>
<i>«What is going on here ?</i>

451
00:19:31,085 --> 00:19:33,053
<i>Something is about</i>
<i>to happen.»</i>

452
00:19:33,087 --> 00:19:36,123
(playing «Rains of Castamere»)

453
00:19:36,157 --> 00:19:39,993
Arya completely believes
that she's going home.

454
00:19:40,027 --> 00:19:42,930
<i>She's with one of the most</i>
<i>powerful guys she's ever met</i>

455
00:19:42,964 --> 00:19:44,598
and he actually
is trying to help her.

456
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:46,867
This was our chance
of getting into the wedding

457
00:19:46,901 --> 00:19:48,902
<i>by using the salt pork wagon.</i>

458
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:51,338
Turn this cart around
and get the hell out of here.

459
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,641
Lord Walder then stops
the proceedings.

460
00:19:54,676 --> 00:19:56,810
Fairley: <i> Roose Bolton
comes over to the table</i>

461
00:19:56,844 --> 00:19:59,146
<i>and sits beside Catelyn,</i>
<i>and that's when</i>

462
00:19:59,181 --> 00:20:02,049
the enormity of
the situation strikes her.

463
00:20:03,117 --> 00:20:05,286
Robb!

464
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,420
(groans)

465
00:20:07,455 --> 00:20:09,857
(groans)

466
00:20:10,925 --> 00:20:12,793
This sea of arrows
come at them.

467
00:20:12,827 --> 00:20:16,730
And Walder Frey is basically
enjoying every moment of this.

468
00:20:16,764 --> 00:20:19,566
Just as we're coming in,
everyone was killing each other.

469
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:21,301
Williams: <i> She realizes
everything is going wrong</i>

470
00:20:21,335 --> 00:20:23,070
<i>and she doesn't even know why.</i>

471
00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:24,772
So it's time to change the plan.
Plan B.

472
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,173
<i>Get the hell out of there.</i>

473
00:20:26,241 --> 00:20:27,574
It's too late.

474
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:28,775
McCann: <i> The Hound,
at the last minute,</i>

475
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,611
<i>manages to just grab her</i>
<i>from behind</i>

476
00:20:30,645 --> 00:20:33,380
<i>and knock her out.</i>

477
00:20:33,415 --> 00:20:35,683
At the same time, Catelyn is
trying to say to her son,

478
00:20:35,717 --> 00:20:38,952
<i>«Get out», but he won't</i>
<i>leave his dying wife.</i>

479
00:20:38,986 --> 00:20:40,621
Mother.

480
00:20:40,655 --> 00:20:43,123
Fairley: <i> Roose Bolton
walks up to Robb</i>

481
00:20:43,157 --> 00:20:45,559
and whispers something in
his ear and then stabs him.

482
00:20:45,593 --> 00:20:48,595
The Lannisters
send their regards.

483
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:51,364
- And she just loses it.
- (wailing)

484
00:20:58,439 --> 00:21:01,374
Gleeson: <i> When Joffrey gets
the news of the Red Wedding,</i>

485
00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:03,109
this is the best day
of his life.

486
00:21:03,144 --> 00:21:05,579
I walk into
the small council chamber

487
00:21:05,614 --> 00:21:07,580
<i>and everyone else sort of knows</i>

488
00:21:07,615 --> 00:21:09,416
<i>what has happened.</i>
<i>I don't.</i>

489
00:21:09,451 --> 00:21:11,485
Killed a few puppies today?

490
00:21:11,553 --> 00:21:13,386
Robb Stark is dead.

491
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:15,088
Joffrey loves
every second of it.

492
00:21:15,122 --> 00:21:18,058
Command Lord Frey
to send Robb Stark's head.

493
00:21:18,092 --> 00:21:20,961
I'm going to serve it
to Sansa at my wedding feast.

494
00:21:20,995 --> 00:21:22,763
She's no longer
yours to torment.

495
00:21:22,797 --> 00:21:25,498
Everyone is mine to torment,

496
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:26,634
you little monster.

497
00:21:26,668 --> 00:21:29,069
Tyrion:
<i>Monsters are dangerous.</i>

498
00:21:29,103 --> 00:21:32,773
And just now kings
are dying like flies.

499
00:21:32,807 --> 00:21:35,876
She finds out that her brother

500
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,944
and her mother
have been killed.

501
00:21:37,979 --> 00:21:41,048
- Sansa.
- Turner:<i> It's very unexpected.</i>

502
00:21:41,082 --> 00:21:43,249
<i>All her hopes are dashed,</i>
<i>like, every single time.</i>

503
00:21:43,284 --> 00:21:45,018
<i>She is pretty bitter.</i>

504
00:21:45,052 --> 00:21:47,120
The usurper Robb Stark is dead.

505
00:21:47,155 --> 00:21:49,222
Betrayed by his bannerman.

506
00:21:49,256 --> 00:21:52,258
Gleeson: <i> Despite his
loss at Blackwater,</i>

507
00:21:52,293 --> 00:21:53,960
the threat of Stannis
is still present.

508
00:21:53,995 --> 00:21:55,929
Davos: <i> It's from Maester
Aemon of the Night's Watch.</i>

509
00:21:55,963 --> 00:21:57,731
<i>Their Lord Commander is dead.</i>

510
00:21:57,765 --> 00:22:00,133
What he saw beyond the Wall,

511
00:22:00,167 --> 00:22:02,903
<i>it's coming for all of us.</i>

512
00:22:02,937 --> 00:22:05,105
Gleeson: <i> Stannis appears
to be more determined</i>

513
00:22:05,139 --> 00:22:06,607
in his desire for the throne.

514
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:09,576
This war of five kings
means nothing.

515
00:22:09,611 --> 00:22:12,112
<i>The true war lies</i>
<i>to the north, my king.</i>

516
00:22:12,146 --> 00:22:13,880
Death marches on the Wall.

517
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,516
Only you can stop him.

518
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,818
Harington: <i> So Sam and Gilly
head towards the Wall</i>

519
00:22:17,852 --> 00:22:19,786
together to go back
to the Night's Watch.

520
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:21,989
The Nightfort's closest
to Castle Black.

521
00:22:22,023 --> 00:22:24,257
It's got a secret sally port.

522
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:27,327
It leads through the Wall
right down into the Nightfort.

523
00:22:27,361 --> 00:22:30,297
- Meera: It's empty.
- Let's find a place to sleep.

524
00:22:31,532 --> 00:22:33,767
So they come across
Bran and Hodor.

525
00:22:33,801 --> 00:22:36,670
Come with us. We'll walk
straight to Castle Black.

526
00:22:36,704 --> 00:22:37,871
Take us north of the Wall.

527
00:22:37,905 --> 00:22:40,040
Why in the world
would you want to go —

528
00:22:40,074 --> 00:22:42,074
I don't want to.
I have to.

529
00:22:44,402 --> 00:22:46,322
Now he comes back
to King's Landing

530
00:22:46,347 --> 00:22:48,515
<i>and, of course,</i>
<i>no one recognizes him.</i>

531
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,484
Step aside, country boy.

532
00:22:50,518 --> 00:22:52,819
He makes it up to Cersei.

533
00:22:52,887 --> 00:22:54,721
<i>And then he sees her.</i>
<i>They just look at each other.</i>

534
00:22:54,756 --> 00:22:57,991
This is really the moment
where he really realizes

535
00:22:58,026 --> 00:23:00,627
that «I'm no longer
the same man.»

536
00:23:00,662 --> 00:23:02,396
She's ecstatic
because she's got

537
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,497
the one person she trusts back.

538
00:23:04,532 --> 00:23:06,967
<i>But he comes in</i>
<i>missing the thing</i>

539
00:23:07,001 --> 00:23:08,769
that makes him
who he is as a man.

540
00:23:08,803 --> 00:23:10,570
<i>They're both a bit like,</i>
<i>«Who are you ?»</i>

541
00:23:10,604 --> 00:23:13,006
A lot happened since they
haven't seen each other.

542
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:15,842
After Jon escapes,
Ygritte catches up to him.

543
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,745
I have to go home now.
I know you won't hurt me.

544
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,047
You know nothing, Jon Snow.

545
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,150
(grunts)

546
00:23:25,653 --> 00:23:27,087
(grunts)

547
00:23:27,121 --> 00:23:29,590
Jon survives and we find him
right at the end of season three

548
00:23:29,624 --> 00:23:32,593
<i>collapsing off his horse and
being dragged into Castle Black.</i>

549
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,260
Carry him inside.

550
00:23:34,295 --> 00:23:37,295
And we leave him, not knowing
whether he'll be safe or not.

551
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:40,810
Under the cover of nightfall,
they send my best men

552
00:23:40,835 --> 00:23:43,036
<i>in through a side entrance</i>

553
00:23:43,071 --> 00:23:44,705
<i>to the city of Yunkai</i>

554
00:23:44,739 --> 00:23:47,608
<i>and have them murder</i>
<i>all of the slavers.</i>

555
00:23:47,642 --> 00:23:49,910
And so that then they can
release all the slaves.

556
00:23:49,944 --> 00:23:52,212
<i>When she finds that</i>
<i>they've been successful,</i>

557
00:23:52,246 --> 00:23:55,015
<i>they come back to wait</i>
<i>outside the gates of Yunkai</i>

558
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:56,583
<i>to see what the fallout</i>
<i>will be.</i>

559
00:23:56,618 --> 00:23:59,019
<i>And then the slaves come out</i>

560
00:23:59,053 --> 00:24:00,954
<i>and the person</i>
<i>they see is Dany,</i>

561
00:24:00,989 --> 00:24:02,556
the woman who's saved them.

562
00:24:02,624 --> 00:24:04,490
- Mhysa!
- Mhysa!

563
00:24:04,525 --> 00:24:07,460
Clarke: <i> The word that comes
out of their mouth is «mhysa»,</i>

564
00:24:07,494 --> 00:24:08,762
<i>which means «mother».</i>

565
00:24:08,797 --> 00:24:12,098
And it's this moment
that Dany for the first time

566
00:24:12,133 --> 00:24:15,435
<i>sees what her new dream</i>
<i>is going to be</i>

567
00:24:15,469 --> 00:24:18,571
and she realizes the possibility of
how many more there are to save.

568
00:24:18,606 --> 00:24:22,542
<i>And it's this wonderful moment of
them looking to her as a mother</i>

569
00:24:22,576 --> 00:24:24,878
<i>and her kind of accepting</i>
<i>their love</i>

570
00:24:24,912 --> 00:24:26,246
and becoming a leader.

571
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,416
(screeching)

572
00:24:31,719 --> 00:24:41,951
