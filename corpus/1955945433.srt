1
00:00:06,917 --> 00:00:08,834
I think it's time
to play the game.

2
00:00:08,917 --> 00:00:10,041
We're playing the game?

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,208
Kids, I changed my mind.

4
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:15,500
I'm staying on as
head of the company.

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,125
KENDALL ROY: He's going to blow
the firm's credibility.

6
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:20,917
I was about to be announced.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,291
It wouldn't necessarily be you.

8
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,458
I want the top job.

9
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:26,208
I am.

10
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:27,208
It's my company.

11
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:29,917
The only way he'll respect you
is if you try to destroy him.

12
00:00:31,917 --> 00:00:34,083
Are you going to cry?
Are you crying?

13
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,083
Female newscaster:
Eels rioted last night in Denver,

14
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,083
demanding medicine,
travel permits,

15
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,041
and full access to the 9.

16
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:20,667
Twelve Eels were arrested and all
the graffiti was found and burned.

17
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,542
Meanwhile, here in Ohio,

18
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:25,709
a warehouse full of graffiti
was found outside of Cleveland,

19
00:04:25,792 --> 00:04:28,417
including a rare discovery
of pens and paper...

20
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,166
- Yuxie, MiPhotos.
- Female automated voice: Here ya go, Montag.

21
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,125
Your fans are waiting
on the 9.

22
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:34,917
Newscaster: Two Firemen
were sent to the hospital

23
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,458
with minor injuries.

24
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:38,583
Fire Commissioner Nyari
released a statement:

25
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:40,625
"Our elected officials
will not allow

26
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:42,083
the happiness
of our great state

27
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,625
to be threatened
by evil Eels.

28
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:45,792
Our Firemen
will defend our democracy."

29
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,250
Yuxie: Great choice.
You'll look good in those.

30
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,792
Newscaster: And now for
the Happiness Index,

31
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,250
we go to Arthur Link.

32
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:57,166
( Firemen shouting
encouragement )

33
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,375
All: Oh!

34
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:15,834
Montag: Ohh!

35
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Firemen: Oh!

36
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,458
Ohh!

37
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:30,458
- There she blows.
- Fireman: Yeah, Captain, yeah!

38
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:33,125
Captain Beatty:
When you have a "why" to fight,

39
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,166
you can bear almost any "how."

40
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,709
I'll give you a "why."
You knocked my tooth out.

41
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:39,792
You're too pretty, anyway.

42
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,166
Lemme see.

43
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,834
Eh. You can keep it that way.

44
00:05:45,917 --> 00:05:48,542
Everything you lose
comes around in another form.

45
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:51,041
I'll get the doc
to print me up another one.

46
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,417
Captain Beatty:
Eels are bad.

47
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,125
They're dangerous,

48
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:57,000
and they want chaos

49
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,458
in your hearts
and your minds.

50
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:01,583
They want to make you unhappy.

51
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:03,375
Eels try to upload graffiti

52
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,333
to the Dark 9
before we can burn it.

53
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:09,041
What should these young Natives do,
Master Trooper?

54
00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,500
Stay vivid on the 9.

55
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:13,166
If you see something,
say something.

56
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,375
Beatty: Eels say we limit information.
Lies!

57
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,792
Master Trooper Montag,

58
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,041
can you read any book
you want on the 9?

59
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,542
Sir, any book, sir.

60
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:24,250
Yuxie, show us
some classics.

61
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:27,458
The Bible...

62
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:30,458
"To the Lighthouse"...

63
00:06:30,542 --> 00:06:32,625
and "Moby Dick."

64
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:34,166
This is all you need to know.

65
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,625
Anything else
will make you sick, crazy.

66
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:38,583
And that's why we're here.

67
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:40,250
To protect you

68
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,917
and to keep you safe
and happy.

69
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,709
Yes, sir!

70
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:48,917
Please rise.

71
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:53,417
All:
Happiness is truth!

72
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,583
Freedom is choice!

73
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:58,583
Self is strength!

74
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:04,083
Don't worry, don't worry,

75
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,417
these are for
training purposes only, OK?

76
00:07:07,417 --> 00:07:08,792
Now, have any of you guys

77
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,250
ever seen one of these
bad things for real?

78
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,917
All: No!

79
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,917
We burned almost every
physical book in the country.

80
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,417
So by the time you guys grow up,
there won't be one book left.

81
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,417
He should probably raise his
hands a little higher, right?

82
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,750
I might miss.

83
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:43,959
Whoo!

84
00:07:46,917 --> 00:07:48,625
This is not a drill!

85
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:50,083
We've got Eels on the move!

86
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:51,834
Man: We got Eels
slipping away!

87
00:07:51,917 --> 00:07:53,625
- Move! Move! Move!
- Montag: Let's ride!

88
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:56,291
Check all gear!
Let's go, let's go!

89
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,166
Let's go!
This is why we train!

90
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,333
Let's burn, let's burn,
let's burn!

91
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:12,125
Montag/Beatty:
♪ Down the red-hot valley, lo! ♪

92
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,000
All:
♪ Down the red-hot valley, lo! ♪

- Salamander!
- All: Ho!

103
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:44,875
- Fireman: Holy sh...!
- Stone! Grab that hammer, baby!

104
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,166
Fireman 2:
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

105
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,750
Kyle! Jove! Around back!

106
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:49,458
Have us a good,
old-fashioned barbecue!

107
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:52,250
Captain wants since Eel soup!
Let's do it, boys!

108
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,834
Pipemen.
Wiki pages?

109
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:57,375
Coltrane?
- I gotta get to the servers. Save what you can.

110
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:58,834
Guys, it's game time.
Y'all know what to do.

111
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:00,208
Freeze! Don't move!

112
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,542
- Montag, upstairs!
- I got him!

113
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,417
- Don't make me chase after you!
- Hold him down!

114
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,875
Everybody stay
right where you are!

115
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:18,083
Hey, drop the cord!

116
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:23,625
Montag: Come on. Yeah.

117
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:26,250
- Aah! Aaah!
- Hey.

118
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,917
Come on.

119
00:09:32,792 --> 00:09:34,625
You dream about
hiding from me!

120
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:36,542
You better wake up
and apologize.

121
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,375
Hey, Captain,
wanna come get some?

122
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,333
Go check the other rooms.

123
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,291
Are you done?

124
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,417
Beatty:
What are you waitin' for?

125
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,166
Waitin' on you.

126
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,291
Raven:
Good evening, Cleveland,

127
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,875
and welcome
to tonight's fire show.

128
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:22,500
Captain Beatty
and his Master Trooper Montag

129
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,291
have uncovered Eels
pretending to be Natives.

130
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,625
What punishment would you like
to see here tonight?

131
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:29,166
Welcome, Natives,

132
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,041
and everybody at home
watchin' on the 9.

133
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:34,208
Look what we found hiding
in your beautiful neighborhood.

134
00:10:36,417 --> 00:10:38,583
Eels don't deserve freedom,
now, do they?

135
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:41,291
- All: No!
- We won't let 'em take our jobs

136
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,291
and steal our tax money,
now, will we?

137
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:45,250
Woman:
Hell, no! Self is strength!

138
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,166
Happiness is truth!

139
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,041
Guess what time it is?

140
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,917
All: Time to burn
for America again!

141
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,625
- Come on.
- Wait, wait, wait. No, no.

142
00:10:55,709 --> 00:10:57,125
No, no. Wait.

143
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,583
Stone! Reprint.

144
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,834
Yuxie, +10 years.

145
00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:05,375
Yuxie:
Identity deletion commencing.

146
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:13,375
Man: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Delete his identity!

147
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:18,917
- Man 1: Ban his travel.
- Man 2: Get that money, too.

148
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,792
Enjoy your new life
as an Eel.

149
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:32,166
I'm not fire...
I'm fire +100.

150
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,291
I'm molten lava on graffiti.

151
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,000
They call me a walking
incinerator for happiness.

152
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,834
Damn, it's a pleasure to burn!

153
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:41,667
Everybody watching at home
on the 9, are you ready?

154
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,500
Man:
Burn 'em, Montag!

155
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,959
Man: Take that, Eels!
Take that!

156
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:01,208
Beatty: Hey.

157
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:02,959
You're still high
on kerosene, aren't you?

158
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:05,000
I can smell it from here.
Let's get goin'.

159
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:12,834
Beatty: A little
after-hours trip.

160
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,417
You hear from Major Curtis?

161
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:17,625
It's happening.
End of the year.

162
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:19,709
Oh! I knew it.

163
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:21,291
- "Major Beatty."
- Yeah.

164
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,125
I'm gonna miss your
ugly mug around here.

165
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:25,333
Yeah. You'll finally
become me.

166
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:26,959
No, no, no.
Not become you.

167
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:30,333
I'm gonna be Captain
motherfuckin' Montag.

168
00:13:56,792 --> 00:13:59,166
Beatty:
There she is.

169
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,000
Montag: Don't worry,
I'll talk to her this time.

170
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:04,375
Keep your dick in your pants
and stand guard.

171
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,208
Well, well, well.
Clarisse.

172
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:09,542
I hope you're not
wasting my time tonight.

173
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,750
Your last tip led me to
Boy Scouts with pornos.

174
00:14:12,834 --> 00:14:15,041
Clarisse: Reactivate my fingers
like you said you would.

175
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:18,083
Beatty: Feed me scraps,
and I'll delete your travel permit.

176
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,917
That's bullshit.
You need me.

177
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,500
How many years
did we restrict you

178
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:29,208
After all the tips
I gave you, I should be free.

179
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,583
A beautiful, free rat.

180
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:36,458
Take a year
off my sentence,

181
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,250
and I'll give you
something you like.

182
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:41,000
Six months.
But it better be good.

183
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,375
I didn't hear the captain
say you could leave.

184
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,375
Yeah?
How come he always makes you wait outside

185
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,458
like a little dog, huh?

186
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,417
You're just like Beatty.

187
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,792
I'm not like Beatty.

188
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:06,250
- Everyone has a master.
- Not me.

189
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,667
You spy on me,
but you never do anything.

190
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:14,500
- Why do I always make you nervous?
- You don't.

191
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:17,375
When I see you burning up Eel's lives,
you don't look nervous.

192
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,291
That's because
I'm very good at my job.

193
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:21,875
Hmm.

194
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:24,750
Have you ever thought,
even for one second,

195
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:26,709
why you do what you do?

196
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:31,291
You should try reading
before burning.

197
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,959
See you around, Montag.

198
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,834
Hey.

199
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:39,500
Off limits.

200
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,625
Let's go.
She recommended a spot.

201
00:15:44,834 --> 00:15:47,083
Man: Captain Beatty,
I... I have my permits, sir,

202
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:49,792
- all one hundred.
- I can't wait to see 'em.

203
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:55,417
See if you can find me
a new pair of shoes.

204
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,166
Captain.

205
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:06,709
Well, look what I found.

206
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,959
You guys must think
you're pretty slick.

207
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:12,000
Beatty: Sit down.
Don't move.

208
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:15,667
Have they uploaded
to the 9?

209
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,125
Nah. Just this monitor.

210
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,792
Hit "play." Do it.

211
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:25,333
Let's see what
they have to say.

212
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:28,917
Before bots and the rise
of automated writing,

213
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,458
we had jobs for journalists...

214
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:33,583
...someday.

215
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:35,959
She'd spend weeks,
sometimes months,

216
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,792
investigating a story,

217
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,125
and then she'd publish
a series of articl...

218
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:43,625
...dreds,
even thousands of words long

219
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:45,083
on physical paper

220
00:16:45,166 --> 00:16:48,625
and the Internet,
or the 9, today,

221
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:51,917
which everyone
was free to read.

222
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,417
But nobody was reading anymore,

223
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,750
or they were just glancing
at the headlines

224
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:57,291
generated by an algorithm...

225
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,583
Beatty:
Thousands of words? Ugh.

226
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:01,792
In your pathetic time,
were people happy?

227
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,208
No. There were so many
millions of opinions

228
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,709
that our country slid
into the Second Civil War.

229
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:09,834
Eight million dead,
including my father.

230
00:17:09,917 --> 00:17:11,500
Your father
must have been old enough

231
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:15,375
to remember a time
when firemen put fires out

232
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,000
instead of starting them.

233
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:20,709
Hey!

234
00:17:20,792 --> 00:17:22,500
Beatty:
Benjamin Franklin,

235
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,250
the founder of our
first fire department,

236
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,792
gave us the right to burn.

237
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,792
Those are lies.

238
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,959
Ben Franklin
did not do that.

239
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:34,041
After the last
of your generation dies,

240
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:37,041
so will your words...

241
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,000
your memories...

242
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:42,417
and the burden
of your fake past.

243
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,041
Female newscaster:
Even in their self-hours,

244
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:46,375
Captain Beatty
and Master Trooper Montag

245
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,542
keep Cleveland safe.

246
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,792
Let's give them a +100 salute.

247
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:53,208
Do your part. See something,
say something. Tell Yuxie.

248
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,709
Meanwhile, Firemen
outside of Buffalo, New York,

249
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:58,250
captured Eels attempting to
cross the border into Canada.

250
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:01,709
There has been an increase in illegal
migration, and local fire stations...

251
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:04,291
Beatty: When you become a captain,
you have to know more.

252
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,083
You'll get to read more.

253
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,458
So you've read
entire books.

254
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:12,750
Yeah, but the Ministry,
of course,

255
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:14,333
they have complete works,
right?

256
00:18:14,417 --> 00:18:16,417
I don't know.

257
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,333
I suppose when they make me
District Major

258
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:21,250
they'll throw me
a few more scraps,

259
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,458
but the Ministry's...

260
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:31,208
How can we see anything but the
fire shadows in the cave...

261
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:34,667
if we're never allowed
to move our heads?

262
00:18:36,709 --> 00:18:38,166
What does that mean?

263
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,542
Nothin'

264
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,208
You're as impatient as I was
when I was your age.

265
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:48,792
Yeah. I just wonder
how much my dad knew.

266
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,250
- He was a great Fireman.
- Damn right he was.

267
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:54,125
- And a friend.
- Fuckin' Eels.

268
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,875
He was a hero.

269
00:18:58,709 --> 00:19:01,250
Same as you'll be,
Guy Montag!

270
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,500
I am a hero.

271
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,417
Hmm.

272
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,166
I am a hero.

274
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:14,959

Keep this sponge alive!

280
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,166
Thus endeth tonight's lesson.

00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:33,125
♪ Salamander ho!
Salamander ho! ♪

282
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:55,750
Clarisse:
It's a DD series.

283
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,291
It works. I put in
a new belt myself.

284
00:20:07,834 --> 00:20:09,208
What do you have for me?

285
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,166
There is an abandoned house
out in the woods near Bedford.

286
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,250
It's a drop-off spot
for graffiti.

287
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:17,125
No, I don't think so.

288
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,166
Montag:
Yuxie, Firemen.

289
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,709
Did we used to put out fires?

290
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:41,875
Yuxie:
That's a classic Eel lie.

291
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:43,542
And Benjamin Franklin.

292
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:46,667
Founder of
our first fire department.

293
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,083
What's wrong, Montag?

294
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,333
Nothin'.

295
00:20:55,417 --> 00:20:57,625
Your vitals have been off
recently.

296
00:20:57,709 --> 00:20:59,625
I'm going to reconfigure
your cocktail

297
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:01,875
and have new drops delivered.

298
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:03,792
That's fine.

299
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,166
Yuxie: John, have you used
your drops today?

300
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:18,792
Yuxie, go dark.

301
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,542
I'm secure now.

302
00:22:53,417 --> 00:22:55,125
Woman:
Clarisse?

303
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:58,041
Haven't had milk all week.
Thanks.

304
00:22:58,125 --> 00:22:59,875
Sorry, I couldn't find
any cooking oil.

305
00:22:59,959 --> 00:23:01,291
That's OK.

306
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:03,166
Be careful
what you're selling.

307
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,834
People are talking.

308
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:13,959
( recorded classical piano
playing )

309
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:49,417
Yuxie, go dark.

310
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,250
I'm secure now, Montag.

311
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:12,208
Yuxie: Signal lost.
Entering a black hole.

312
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:15,333
Set a transponder
so Raven can find us.

313
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,083
Montag: Transponder set.

314
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:23,625
Did Clarisse tell
you about this spot?

315
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:01,208
Douglas.

316
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:05,208
Freeman, check around back.

317
00:27:10,834 --> 00:27:12,875
Stone!

318
00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:15,583
- Jove, Kyle, clear this room!
- Yes, sir.

319
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:34,166
Beatty: Montag,
get that tumor Eel on her feet.

320
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,917
The rest of you
search the house.

321
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,542
- Now.
- Fireman: Yes, sir.

322
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,875
How many of you are there?

323
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:45,542
How many?

324
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,750
"Grapes of Wrath."

325
00:27:52,834 --> 00:27:54,375
Hmm. Get her up.

326
00:27:54,458 --> 00:27:57,792
You heard the captain.
Up. On your feet.

327
00:27:57,875 --> 00:27:59,834
Beatty:
How many more of these do you have,

328
00:27:59,917 --> 00:28:01,709
Ma Joad?

329
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:09,083
If you can read,
you can talk.

330
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:11,667
Play the man, Master Ridley.

331
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:15,333
We shall this day light such a candle,
by God's grace,

332
00:28:15,417 --> 00:28:17,709
as I trust
shall never be put out.

333
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,333
Fireman:
Captain Beatty!

334
00:28:19,417 --> 00:28:21,834
You're never gonna believe
what we found, sir.

335
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:23,625
You gotta get up here.

336
00:28:23,709 --> 00:28:26,417
Phelps, keep eyes on her.

337
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:07,083
This is gonna be the most important
burn the country has ever seen, sir.

338
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:09,208
Beatty:
Go see if Raven followed the transponder.

339
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:11,542
- But sir...
- You just heard the captain.

340
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,000
Now move.

341
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:21,709
A regular damn
Tower Of Babel.

342
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,917
I've only seen something
like this once in my career,

343
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,166
when I was a cadet.

344
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:31,667
Have you ever seen
a physical book before?

345
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,834
Hmm.

346
00:29:41,834 --> 00:29:46,041
Kafka. A pornographer
and a sexual pervert.

347
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:47,875
I like that about him.

348
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:50,083
Have you read that book?

349
00:29:50,166 --> 00:29:53,208
Every Fireman sooner or
later wants to know...

350
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,959
what the Eels know,

351
00:29:55,041 --> 00:29:58,667
what's in all this graffiti
that we burn.

352
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,834
You want to hold it?

353
00:30:05,709 --> 00:30:06,834
Go on.

354
00:30:06,917 --> 00:30:09,542
Before the men come back.

355
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:18,542
Open it.

356
00:30:25,709 --> 00:30:27,250
Read.

357
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:29,500
Read.

358
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:33,208
Read.

359
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:45,083
Do you want to know
what's inside all these books?

360
00:30:46,709 --> 00:30:48,500
Insanity.

361
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:52,500
The Eels
want to measure their place

362
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:54,834
in the universe,

363
00:30:54,917 --> 00:30:58,250
so they turn to these novels

364
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:01,458
about non-existent people.

365
00:31:01,542 --> 00:31:04,750
Or worse, philosophers.
Look, here's Spinoza.

366
00:31:04,834 --> 00:31:07,917
One expert screaming down
another expert's throat.

367
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,875
"We have free will."
"No, all of our actions are predetermined."

368
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:14,625
Each one says the opposite,

369
00:31:14,709 --> 00:31:18,125
and a man comes away lost,

370
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:22,583
feeling more... bestial
and lonely than before.

371
00:31:22,667 --> 00:31:25,542
Now, if you don't
want a person unhappy,

372
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:29,291
you don't give them two sides
of a question to worry about.

373
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:31,750
- Just give 'em one.
- Better yet, none.

374
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:36,709
Ah. See?

375
00:31:36,792 --> 00:31:38,208
"Huck Finn"...

376
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:40,375
and his "nigger" friend.

377
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:44,417
The whites knew that you blacks
were offended, so what did we do?

378
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,500
We burned it.

379
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:51,041
Oh.

380
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:53,041
And then "Native Son"
came along,

381
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:56,166
and the whites didn't appreciate
that one all that much,

382
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,125
so they burned it, too.

383
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,000
Why didn't they like it?

384
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,834
Henry Miller,
Hemingway.

385
00:32:06,917 --> 00:32:09,083
The feminists don't approve,

386
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:12,250
so into the flames they go.

387
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:15,875
You see, we are not
born equal, Guy,

388
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:18,750
so we must be made equal
by the fire,

389
00:32:18,834 --> 00:32:22,792
and then... we can be happy.

390
00:32:25,208 --> 00:32:27,000
So, we burn.

391
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:32,542
Well,
let's clear all this filth out of here and...

392
00:32:32,625 --> 00:32:34,458
get the fire show
started with.

393
00:32:34,542 --> 00:32:35,834
Shall we?

394
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:40,083
But take one last look.

395
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,750
You may never see
anything like this again.

396
00:32:44,709 --> 00:32:48,709
Your grandchildren won't even
understand what a book is.

397
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,083
Woman: Can you tell us
anything about what's inside?

398
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:29,583
Nothing that can't burn
at 451 degrees.

399
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:31,500
Newscaster:
And there you have it...

400
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:12,458
Beatty: Montag.

401
00:34:12,542 --> 00:34:14,667
Let's get her
out of here.

402
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,417
Come on.

403
00:34:21,792 --> 00:34:22,959
Let's go.

404
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:26,375
Lady, this whole house
is gonna get torched.

405
00:34:26,458 --> 00:34:28,458
And me, with my books.

406
00:34:28,542 --> 00:34:29,500
Let's go.

407
00:34:29,583 --> 00:34:30,542
Montag, never mind.

408
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:32,375
Just get over here, please.

409
00:34:32,458 --> 00:34:34,583
Captain, we're just
gonna leave her?

410
00:34:34,667 --> 00:34:36,917
Get over here now.

411
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:42,125
Look, miss,
you can do what you like,

412
00:34:42,208 --> 00:34:45,750
but you know as well as I do
these books are gonna burn.

413
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,834
No.

414
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:17,333
Omnis.

415
00:36:57,458 --> 00:36:59,041
Omnis.

416
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:01,959
The Ministry has wiped out
the word "omnis"

417
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:03,709
from across the 9.

418
00:37:03,792 --> 00:37:06,166
This coward is not
going to become a martyr

419
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,750
before we find out what the
hell she's shouting about.

420
00:37:08,834 --> 00:37:11,375
Captain Beatty,
perhaps you can explain

421
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:14,542
why you let this Eel
start a bonfire?

422
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:18,041
We didn't know she had a match,
sir, and the kerosene...

423
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:19,583
Major Curtis
spoke highly of you.

424
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:21,959
I hope I can come
to understand why.

425
00:37:22,041 --> 00:37:25,875
After "Beatty's Barbecue,"
our team reported the word "omnis"

426
00:37:25,959 --> 00:37:28,959
appearing in unusually
high numbers on the Dark 9.

427
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:31,834
If an Eel is going
to blow herself up for it,

428
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:34,000
we need to get ahead of it.

429
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:38,458
Raven:
...the first self-fire in Ohio's history,

430
00:37:38,542 --> 00:37:40,083
and only the fourth
in the nation.

431
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:42,417
This marks a new low
in Eel actions

432
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,875
threatening our happiness.

433
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:46,375
Details about this tumor Eel
are coming in.

434
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:48,083
She lived alone in the woods,

435
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:50,125
without Yuxie,
like a wild animal,

436
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,417
and suffered from a +100
mental illness,

437
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,500
a result of extreme exposure
to reading graffiti.

438
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:58,250
Coward!

439
00:37:58,333 --> 00:38:01,375
Raven: We will be updating
you as more details come in.

440
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:05,500
Whoa.

441
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:06,917
You all right?

442
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,250
Always.

443
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:10,125
Life of a Master Trooper, huh?

444
00:38:16,959 --> 00:38:18,875
Beatty: Montag.

445
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:25,500
You hesitated tonight
in front of the men.

446
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:28,709
I know.

447
00:38:28,792 --> 00:38:30,709
But it won't happen
again.

448
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:34,542
You know, it's my first time
seeing a self-burn, too.

449
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:38,208
But as far as I'm concerned,

450
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:40,625
it's just proves
we're doing the right thing.

451
00:38:40,709 --> 00:38:43,917
What was that old lady
talkin' about?

452
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,834
"Master Ridley, play th..."
Somethin'.

453
00:38:48,917 --> 00:38:51,500
Well, back when
people still believed in gods,

454
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:55,291
the Brits burned alive
two Eels at the stake,

455
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:56,917
Ridley and Latimer,

456
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,375
for praying to a different book
than their queen did.

457
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:03,709
Before us,
people committed genocides over books,

458
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:06,667
while others blew themselves up
killing innocent people.

459
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:09,000
Insanity +100.

460
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:11,500
But why did she burn herself
for books?

461
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:14,834
Well, she tried to burn us all,
don't you think?

462
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:17,959
She didn't say "coward."

463
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:21,333
She said "omnis."
What is that?

464
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:24,125
Well, the commissioner won't say
what the Ministry knows,

465
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:27,625
but I guess we're gonna
have to find out.

466
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,792
Burn me.

467
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,458
- John.
- Go ahead.

468
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:44,709
Hurry up.
I won't ask twice.

469
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:54,208
I know you're different
than the other men.

470
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:57,125
I watched you grow up,

471
00:39:57,208 --> 00:40:00,750
and that's how I know
you feel the same inside as me.

472
00:40:02,875 --> 00:40:04,166
Closer.

473
00:40:07,875 --> 00:40:09,709
I've been burned so many times

474
00:40:09,792 --> 00:40:13,667
I don't know where my scars
end and my body begins.

475
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:28,375
There's no way
you're gonna break.

476
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:33,625
You're the youngest cadet I ever
accepted into the Youth Fire Brigade.

477
00:40:34,834 --> 00:40:37,375
I raised you.

478
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:42,041
And one day
you'll be just like me, son.

479
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:45,458
You won't feel anything
when they burn you.

480
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:00,000
Yuxie, go dark, please.

481
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:02,750
Yuxie:
I'm secure now, Montag.

482
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,542
"I am a sick man.

483
00:41:25,542 --> 00:41:27,875
I am a wicked man.

484
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:32,417
An unattractive man.

485
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,000
I think my liver hurts."

486
00:41:44,667 --> 00:41:48,959
"I agree that
'two times two is four'

487
00:41:49,041 --> 00:41:51,959
is an excellent thing.

488
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:56,125
But 'two times two is five'

489
00:41:56,208 --> 00:42:01,333
is something also
a most charming little thing."

490
00:42:01,417 --> 00:42:03,917
- Yuxie: False.
- Yuxie, I said go dark.

491
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,667
We are dark.
It's just me and you.

492
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:10,458
But that is false.
Two times two can only be four.

493
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:14,083
What are you doing, Montag?

494
00:42:17,625 --> 00:42:19,750
Are you feeling OK?

495
00:42:23,083 --> 00:42:25,166
Where are you going?

496
00:44:12,375 --> 00:44:15,125
Man:
I don't think that old woman killed herself.

497
00:44:15,208 --> 00:44:17,125
I think they staged it.

498
00:44:17,208 --> 00:44:18,792
It's all fake.

499
00:44:18,875 --> 00:44:20,458
Didn't even bother
to sync her lips this time.

500
00:44:20,542 --> 00:44:21,542
You saw that shit, right?

501
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:23,542
Yeah, they definitely
murdered her.

502
00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:25,417
Why do you keep
pounding away at it?

503
00:44:27,041 --> 00:44:29,166
Hey. Are you good?

504
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:32,166
Clarisse, you know
what we're working on.

505
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:33,959
We need someone
with your connections.

506
00:44:34,041 --> 00:44:36,750
So you tell me when you're
ready to come back to us.

507
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,875
- See you later.
- Be safe.

508
00:44:47,959 --> 00:44:50,375
( dogs barking
in distance )

509
00:45:20,709 --> 00:45:22,625
What do you want?
- Hey!

510
00:45:22,709 --> 00:45:24,375
Did Beatty send you?

511
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:26,792
No, I just came to talk.

512
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,709
I want to know
who that old woman was.

513
00:45:31,792 --> 00:45:33,208
I don't know.

514
00:45:33,291 --> 00:45:37,625
She lit herself on fire...
for books.

515
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:42,709
Because I can still
smell her burning.

516
00:45:42,792 --> 00:45:46,583
- You did that.
- And you told us exactly where to find her.

517
00:45:48,917 --> 00:45:52,542
She didn't say "coward."
She said "omnis."

518
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:54,041
What is that?

519
00:45:56,166 --> 00:45:57,500
I don't know.

520
00:45:59,834 --> 00:46:02,208
I just want to
show you something.

521
00:46:12,792 --> 00:46:15,583
I took it from her house.

522
00:46:15,667 --> 00:46:17,542
Is this a trap, pipeman?

523
00:46:17,625 --> 00:46:21,083
If anybody
sees me with this...

524
00:46:21,166 --> 00:46:22,667
I'm dead.

525
00:46:47,625 --> 00:46:48,667
Hey, Clarisse.

526
00:46:51,583 --> 00:46:52,583
Yeah?

527
00:46:54,959 --> 00:46:57,667
( voice in hallway,
indistinct )

528
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:10,667
She didn't see
who you were.

529
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:11,959
I shouldn't be here.

530
00:47:12,041 --> 00:47:13,208
Then leave.

531
00:47:34,542 --> 00:47:36,250
Please don't do that.

532
00:48:04,125 --> 00:48:06,625
Can you read that
out loud?

533
00:48:06,709 --> 00:48:08,417
Please?

534
00:48:13,834 --> 00:48:16,959
"Even if man were nothing
but a piano key,

535
00:48:17,041 --> 00:48:21,583
even if this were proved to him by
natural science and mathematics,

536
00:48:21,667 --> 00:48:25,125
even then, he will invent
destruction and chaos.

537
00:48:25,208 --> 00:48:28,458
He will invent all kinds of
suffering out of ingratitude

538
00:48:28,542 --> 00:48:31,166
simply to convince himself
that he is a man

539
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:33,166
and not a piano key.

540
00:48:36,083 --> 00:48:37,959
Hard to understand, right?

541
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:44,375
The Ministry has been wiping away
language in order to wipe away thought.

542
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:47,000
There used to be 6,000 languages
in the world.

543
00:48:47,083 --> 00:48:49,875
Today there are fewer than 60.

544
00:48:49,959 --> 00:48:55,000
Why do you think the Ministry wants to
create one universal language on the 9?

545
00:48:55,083 --> 00:48:58,041
For the connection
and happiness of...

546
00:48:58,125 --> 00:49:00,208
all Natives.

547
00:49:00,291 --> 00:49:03,750
During the Second Civil War,
the old tech companies,

548
00:49:03,834 --> 00:49:06,291
they built systems
to predict our thoughts.

549
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:09,834
Then they became the Ministry,
or the Ministry joined them.

550
00:49:09,917 --> 00:49:12,792
And they sold us
what we wanted,

551
00:49:12,875 --> 00:49:14,875
self and happiness,

552
00:49:14,959 --> 00:49:16,792
which the 9 provides in spades

553
00:49:16,875 --> 00:49:20,333
and what we hired you
to defend... with fire.

554
00:49:20,417 --> 00:49:22,792
You're telling me
people wanted it this way.

555
00:49:22,875 --> 00:49:24,792
The Ministry
didn't do this to us.

556
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:26,917
We did it to ourselves.

557
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,083
We demanded a world like this.

558
00:49:39,166 --> 00:49:41,250
Let me ask you somethin'.

559
00:49:44,041 --> 00:49:45,291
Benjamin Franklin...

560
00:49:45,375 --> 00:49:47,333
did he start
the first fire department?

561
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:49,333
Yeah, but to put fires out,

562
00:49:49,417 --> 00:49:51,417
not to start them.

563
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:55,333
- Beatty told me the opposite.
- I know exactly what Beatty told you.

564
00:49:55,417 --> 00:49:57,875
Maybe he believes that;
maybe he's lying to you.

565
00:49:57,959 --> 00:50:02,250
Maybe when Beatty was young,
he let his fire captain lie to him.

566
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:06,166
Do you have trouble with
memory

567
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:10,917
What about you?
Can you remember your past?

568
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,125
Some.

569
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:15,250
Are you hungry?
I don't have much.

570
00:50:18,458 --> 00:50:19,834
How 'bout your parents?

571
00:50:19,917 --> 00:50:22,291
Can you remember them?

572
00:50:24,417 --> 00:50:29,208
I was raised by Eels to be an Eel,
pretending to be a Native.

573
00:50:29,291 --> 00:50:32,458
We read books, watched films...

574
00:50:32,542 --> 00:50:34,333
everything you burn.

575
00:50:34,417 --> 00:50:38,583
By the time I was a teen,
I wanted to be normal, like you.

576
00:50:38,667 --> 00:50:41,166
So I ran away from home,

577
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:46,542
got hooked on the 9,
the drops... everything.

578
00:50:46,625 --> 00:50:49,208
I was happy for a while.

579
00:50:49,291 --> 00:50:52,208
Then, you know, life.

580
00:50:52,291 --> 00:50:54,166
Men.

581
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:58,125
I was broke,
so I started selling graffiti.

582
00:51:02,625 --> 00:51:06,000
Didn't know that old woman
would be there.

583
00:51:08,041 --> 00:51:11,834
I had never thought about the people
behind the things that I burn.

584
00:51:14,041 --> 00:51:18,291
I mean, they must have spent
their entire life making things.

585
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:20,834
And here I come,

586
00:51:20,917 --> 00:51:23,834
in two seconds...
it's gone.

587
00:51:33,792 --> 00:51:36,000
I want to show you something.

588
00:52:16,792 --> 00:52:18,000
Try.

589
00:52:19,709 --> 00:52:21,208
Come on.

590
00:52:37,625 --> 00:52:39,208
Like this?

591
00:52:47,375 --> 00:52:49,875
Here.

592
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:53,834
Put this one here on top.

593
00:52:53,917 --> 00:52:57,875
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.
Try it.

594
00:53:00,375 --> 00:53:03,917
( plays note with
slight vibrato )

595
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:53,875
All the details surrounding
the Omnis are classified,

596
00:53:53,959 --> 00:53:56,333
but the Ministry will include
the public to help smoke it out.

597
00:53:56,417 --> 00:53:58,458
The danger is real
and immediate.

598
00:53:58,542 --> 00:54:01,166
Washington's watching us, boys.

599
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:02,917
I want your cities
to burn so hot

600
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,125
the commander in chief
can roast marshmallows

601
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:07,542
all the way
from the White House.

602
00:54:07,625 --> 00:54:10,500
Make it rain kerosene.

603
00:55:03,875 --> 00:55:06,875
Beatty: DNA.

604
00:55:06,959 --> 00:55:08,250
The genetic information

605
00:55:08,333 --> 00:55:10,667
found inside
all living organisms.

606
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:15,041
The Eels have converted
the language of technology

607
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:17,291
into the the language of DNA.

608
00:55:17,375 --> 00:55:20,250
They've figured out a way
to insert enough graffiti

609
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:23,500
into this microscopic
speck of DNA

610
00:55:23,583 --> 00:55:26,417
to bury the earth
ten times over.

611
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:30,792
The Omnis is the collective
consciousness of mankind.

612
00:55:30,875 --> 00:55:35,125
It will be every book,
painting, music, film,

613
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:36,625
all of history,

614
00:55:36,709 --> 00:55:39,000
everything on the savages'
internet of old...

615
00:55:39,083 --> 00:55:42,417
news, memoirs, facts...

616
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:47,875
it will be a trillion
person-years of graffiti...

617
00:55:47,959 --> 00:55:52,208
all inside this
microscopic strand of DNA.

618
00:55:52,291 --> 00:55:55,000
Now, the Ministry
believes it is here in Ohio,

619
00:55:55,083 --> 00:55:57,625
and in transit
to scientists in Canada.

620
00:55:57,709 --> 00:56:00,417
We have to find it
before it crosses the border.

621
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:03,125
Captain, if they succeed...

622
00:56:03,208 --> 00:56:04,917
how will we stop it?

623
00:56:07,125 --> 00:56:10,583
If the Omnis is unleashed,
there will be no way to stop it.

624
00:56:12,041 --> 00:56:15,375
All of humanity's chaotic
knowledge will burst forth

625
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:19,458
like mosquitoes
spreading malaria...

626
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:23,000
and the dark countries
will take over.

627
00:56:25,041 --> 00:56:28,542
Even the greatest army
of Firemen

628
00:56:28,625 --> 00:56:33,125
will seem like spitting babies
before the Omnis.

629
00:56:33,208 --> 00:56:36,291
And everything our parents,
our grandparents,

630
00:56:36,375 --> 00:56:40,709
sacrificed in the Second
Civil War will be lost.

631
00:56:40,792 --> 00:56:44,500
We will not let that happen.

632
00:56:46,959 --> 00:56:50,000
We will burn down the city tonight,
gentlemen!

633
00:56:50,083 --> 00:56:51,750
- Salamander!
- All: Ho!

634
00:56:51,834 --> 00:56:54,125
- Salamander!
- Ho!

635
00:57:02,083 --> 00:57:05,333
Montag: Eels on the move!
Eels on the move!

636
00:57:05,417 --> 00:57:06,834
This is why we burn!

637
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:20,125
Beatty:
If any of you know where the Omnis is

638
00:57:20,208 --> 00:57:22,875
and don't talk,
your lives will be burned!

639
00:57:24,583 --> 00:57:26,208
Raven:
Breaking news.

640
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:29,041
There is a new threat
to our nation's happiness...

641
00:57:29,125 --> 00:57:30,417
the Omnis.

642
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,041
The Ministry
has not revealed details,

643
00:57:32,125 --> 00:57:34,000
but fire divisions
across Pennsylvania,

644
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:34,959
Indiana, and Ohio,

645
00:57:35,041 --> 00:57:36,083
are conducting raids,

646
00:57:36,166 --> 00:57:38,041
searching for this new evil.

647
00:57:38,125 --> 00:57:39,917
Fireman:
Get him! Get him!

648
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,625
Omnis! What's that mean to you?
Huh!

649
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,542
Beatty: You're not
doing yourselves any favors.

650
00:57:44,625 --> 00:57:46,417
Tell me where the Omnis is!

651
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:49,125
Eel: Death to fire!
Real liberty unite!

652
00:57:49,208 --> 00:57:50,875
Come here!

653
00:57:50,959 --> 00:57:53,417
Fireman: Slippery little Eel.
In the truck!

654
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:57,500
Beatty: They try to say there's
no evidence danger exists.

655
00:57:57,583 --> 00:58:00,166
Well, then show me the evidence
danger doesn't exist.

656
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:02,583
The truth is,
this danger is real,

657
00:58:02,667 --> 00:58:03,834
the threat is real.

658
00:58:03,917 --> 00:58:05,458
Omnis is real.

659
00:58:05,542 --> 00:58:07,417
Eel:
Death to fire!

660
00:58:13,834 --> 00:58:15,291
Clarisse:
"To be sure, I myself

661
00:58:15,375 --> 00:58:17,792
just made up
all these words of yours;

662
00:58:17,875 --> 00:58:20,000
this, too,
is from underground.

663
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:22,375
I've spent forty years
on end there

664
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:25,041
listening to these words
of yours through a crack.

665
00:58:25,125 --> 00:58:26,542
I thought them up myself

666
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:29,250
since this was all
that would get thought up."

667
00:58:32,083 --> 00:58:33,417
Beatty:
I will have you

668
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,875
down on this street
before the night is over!

669
00:58:35,959 --> 00:58:38,709
Consequences of silence
will be severe!

670
00:58:38,792 --> 00:58:40,750
Help yourselves
and your neighbors

671
00:58:40,834 --> 00:58:42,667
by telling us what you know!

672
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:46,083
Not tomorrow,
not the next day, but now!

673
00:58:49,083 --> 00:58:52,583
Montag: "At least I myself
have only recently resolved

674
00:58:52,667 --> 00:58:55,000
to recall some
of my former adventures,

675
00:58:55,083 --> 00:58:58,125
which, till now,
I have always avoided.

676
00:58:58,208 --> 00:59:00,834
Can it be that
you are indeed so gullible

677
00:59:00,917 --> 00:59:03,166
to imagine I will
publish this all?

678
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:05,250
And, what's more,
give it to you to read?"

679
00:59:26,917 --> 00:59:30,625
Montag:
"Now I want precisely to make a test.

680
00:59:30,709 --> 00:59:32,542
Is it possible to... to per...

681
00:59:32,625 --> 00:59:36,041
Is it possible to be perfectly
candid with oneself

682
00:59:36,125 --> 00:59:40,792
and not be afraid...
of the whole truth?"

683
01:00:14,542 --> 01:00:17,792
Beatty: One of you Eels must
know something about the Omnis.

684
01:00:25,583 --> 01:00:29,166
What if I tell these people
what you do?

685
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,291
What would be worse...

686
01:00:37,375 --> 01:00:40,875
what I do to you,
or what they do to you?

687
01:00:42,625 --> 01:00:45,000
Man: We're all
the same here.

688
01:00:45,083 --> 01:00:47,667
Whatever you do to her,
you do to us.

689
01:00:49,166 --> 01:00:50,625
Is that so?

690
01:00:50,709 --> 01:00:52,792
Fair enough.

691
01:00:54,291 --> 01:00:56,125
Ohh!

692
01:00:56,208 --> 01:00:59,750
I am your judge,
and I am your court.

693
01:00:59,834 --> 01:01:02,500
I receive you
when you come,

694
01:01:02,583 --> 01:01:04,417
- and I...
- Ohh!

695
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,667
dismiss you when you go!

696
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,792
- Beatty: Round 'em up!
- Fireman: Get over here.

697
01:01:12,875 --> 01:01:15,667
Round 'em up. Over there!

698
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:18,625
Round 'em up.

699
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:22,583
Come on. Come here.

700
01:01:31,834 --> 01:01:33,959
Newscaster: The Ministry
has placed the nation

701
01:01:34,041 --> 01:01:37,750
in a +100 state of security
until the Omnis is found.

702
01:01:37,834 --> 01:01:40,250
Youth Cadets have been
recruited to patrol borders

703
01:01:40,333 --> 01:01:41,917
and search all transit hubs.

704
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,959
Do your duty.
Stay vivid on the 9

705
01:01:44,041 --> 01:01:47,291
and report
all suspicious activity.

706
01:01:47,375 --> 01:01:50,750
I have to get out of here.

707
01:01:50,834 --> 01:01:52,792
Where you gonna go?

708
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:54,709
There are people hiding out
at a compound

709
01:01:54,792 --> 01:01:56,083
my family used to know.

710
01:01:56,166 --> 01:01:57,625
Maybe I can help them.

711
01:01:57,709 --> 01:01:59,583
They got checkpoints
all over the place.

712
01:01:59,667 --> 01:02:01,333
You think you can make it?

713
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:04,041
I have a friend
who knows where they are.

714
01:02:04,125 --> 01:02:06,458
I think he can help me.

715
01:02:08,625 --> 01:02:11,291
Will I see you again?

716
01:02:37,458 --> 01:02:39,709
Fireman:
Keep searching for that Omnis!

717
01:02:42,667 --> 01:02:45,333
- Montag: Get 'em out of here!
- Fireman: Yes, sir.

718
01:02:58,542 --> 01:03:00,667
All clear.
Let's check upstairs.

719
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:05,000
Man: Shh!

720
01:03:14,959 --> 01:03:17,917
( opens door,
pulls back curtain )

721
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:07,792
Beatty: And how would you
explain your behavior today?

722
01:04:07,875 --> 01:04:09,709
I fucked up.

723
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:14,834
I couldn't tell you why.

724
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:18,417
Eels use kids as decoys
all the time.

725
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:22,542
No excuse. I know my actions
put you and the men in danger.

726
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:24,750
What if they had
had the Omnis?

727
01:04:30,959 --> 01:04:34,125
Captain Beatty...

728
01:04:34,208 --> 01:04:36,917
sir, it's been a true honor.

729
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,792
But...

730
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:42,166
I respectfully ask
that you accept my resignation.

731
01:04:47,125 --> 01:04:48,667
Get that off my desk.

732
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:49,750
I'm sorry, John.

733
01:04:49,834 --> 01:04:50,959
Do it. Now.

734
01:04:59,125 --> 01:05:01,291
Are you serious?

735
01:05:01,375 --> 01:05:05,709
I just submitted your name
to replace me as captain.

736
01:05:05,792 --> 01:05:07,542
- It's not about that.
- Oh.

737
01:05:07,625 --> 01:05:09,792
So you're willing
to throw away

738
01:05:09,875 --> 01:05:12,583
the sixteen years
that I've invested in you.

739
01:05:12,667 --> 01:05:15,583
I have sixteen years

740
01:05:15,667 --> 01:05:18,875
of the Ministry's shit
in my head.

741
01:05:18,959 --> 01:05:20,750
And I want to know
why we burn.

742
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:23,291
- I want to decide.
- Ah.

743
01:05:23,375 --> 01:05:25,917
- So you want to prove you exist.
- Yeah, I do.

744
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,083
I got things inside my head
that don't make sense.

745
01:05:29,166 --> 01:05:30,625
Dreams about my dad.

746
01:05:30,709 --> 01:05:33,417
Look, as your
commanding officer,

747
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:35,917
it is my duty to report you

748
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,250
for letting two Eels
go free today.

749
01:05:38,333 --> 01:05:41,333
And if I do that,
you will be tried for treason.

750
01:05:41,417 --> 01:05:44,750
And there will be nothing
I can do to protect you.

751
01:05:44,834 --> 01:05:48,542
You betray me...

752
01:05:48,625 --> 01:05:50,417
and I will burn you.

753
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:54,000
And then I will
burn your ashes.

754
01:05:55,709 --> 01:05:59,750
Dreams are a terror, son.
I know.

755
01:05:59,834 --> 01:06:03,875
But it's just your mind
flingin' itself to pieces.

756
01:06:05,041 --> 01:06:08,291
Just stand back
from the centrifuge, OK?

757
01:06:08,375 --> 01:06:10,625
You have a virus.

758
01:06:10,709 --> 01:06:11,750
Go home...

759
01:06:11,834 --> 01:06:13,208
and rest.

760
01:06:14,542 --> 01:06:16,083
Take a hot bath.

761
01:06:18,917 --> 01:06:21,208
And then you report
to work tomorrow.

762
01:06:21,291 --> 01:06:23,208
But don't make me
come get you.

763
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:45,291
Reactivate.

764
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,834
Yuxie:
Hello, John.

765
01:06:46,917 --> 01:06:50,250
Yuxie, get me Fireman Douglas.

766
01:06:54,917 --> 01:06:57,709
Raven: Do your part.
See something, say something.

767
01:06:57,792 --> 01:07:00,542
Tell Yuxie. Together,
we will keep Cleveland...

768
01:07:14,208 --> 01:07:16,542
Montag. Get in.

769
01:07:26,291 --> 01:07:28,041
My friend Gustav...

770
01:07:28,125 --> 01:07:29,792
I'm no friend of his.

771
01:07:29,875 --> 01:07:31,625
Don't look at me.

772
01:07:31,709 --> 01:07:34,333
Don't fuckin' look at me!

773
01:07:34,417 --> 01:07:35,709
You deleted my brother's life,
man!

774
01:07:35,792 --> 01:07:39,250
And you gave him 25 years!
You're scum!

775
01:07:39,333 --> 01:07:40,625
Clarisse:
That's enough.

776
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,542
Gustavo:
You better be right about him.

777
01:07:49,625 --> 01:07:51,208
Where we goin'?

778
01:07:51,291 --> 01:07:52,875
To those people at the compound
I told you about.

779
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:55,041
They want to see you.

780
01:07:55,125 --> 01:07:58,792
- Something about the Omnis.
- Gustavo: Do it, or I will.

781
01:08:03,709 --> 01:08:04,959
You have to put this on.

782
01:08:29,875 --> 01:08:31,750
Who else was with 'em?

783
01:08:31,834 --> 01:08:34,542
Douglas: I don't know, sir.
Axix-Cam picked up Clarisse.

784
01:08:34,625 --> 01:08:37,333
I knew Montag was a rat.
I told you he wasn't pure.

785
01:08:37,417 --> 01:08:39,041
I didn't ask your opinion!

786
01:08:39,125 --> 01:08:41,041
And the next time
I tell you to follow someone,

787
01:08:41,125 --> 01:08:43,333
you crawl into their asshole!

788
01:08:43,417 --> 01:08:44,959
You hear me?!

789
01:08:46,166 --> 01:08:48,417
Report back to the station.

790
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:49,834
Yes, sir.

791
01:08:52,792 --> 01:08:55,333
Yuxie:
This is a problem, John.

792
01:09:17,208 --> 01:09:20,417
Clarisse told us
you stole this.

793
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:22,500
But when I see you
sitting there,

794
01:09:22,583 --> 01:09:24,542
all I can see is fire.

795
01:09:24,625 --> 01:09:29,083
You must be burning all these books,
and us, in your mind.

796
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:31,291
Because you are what you are,

797
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:33,542
and perhaps,
that's all you'll ever be...

798
01:09:33,625 --> 01:09:34,834
fire.

799
01:09:34,917 --> 01:09:37,208
This man is just like
his Commandant Beatty.

800
01:09:37,291 --> 01:09:39,000
He's not to be trusted.

801
01:09:39,083 --> 01:09:41,875
Why did you burn books
your whole life?

802
01:09:41,959 --> 01:09:44,000
Because that's all I know.

803
01:09:44,083 --> 01:09:46,542
Deze man is
een stuk stront.

804
01:09:46,625 --> 01:09:49,250
But I want to do
something else.

805
01:09:49,333 --> 01:09:51,250
Why?

806
01:09:58,667 --> 01:10:00,250
When I look at that book,

807
01:10:00,333 --> 01:10:02,583
it made me remember
when I was a kid.

808
01:10:04,375 --> 01:10:08,083
Just sittin' by the ocean...

809
01:10:08,166 --> 01:10:12,834
and I was trying to fill
this sieve with sand.

810
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:17,125
But the faster I poured,
the faster the sand fell through it.

811
01:10:19,542 --> 01:10:21,291
Lookin' at the words
in that book,

812
01:10:21,375 --> 01:10:24,959
I felt like they...
they were passing right through me.

813
01:10:27,834 --> 01:10:31,834
Like my whole life just...

814
01:10:31,917 --> 01:10:34,208
passed right through me.

815
01:10:34,291 --> 01:10:37,166
And that I missed it.

816
01:10:39,542 --> 01:10:42,458
I'm not gonna let
that happen again.

817
01:10:46,834 --> 01:10:49,166
Books are here
to remind us

818
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:51,375
what fools we can be.

819
01:10:51,458 --> 01:10:54,750
But if we can remember,
if the Omnis can spread,

820
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:58,041
then maybe we will win.

821
01:10:58,125 --> 01:11:00,125
The disconnected human mind

822
01:11:00,208 --> 01:11:04,417
is the last bastion
against the technological world.

823
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:09,000
It's the most secure place
to preserve these books.

824
01:11:09,083 --> 01:11:11,125
We're totally off the grid.

825
01:11:11,208 --> 01:11:14,917
No computers,
no way for you to Firemen to track us

826
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,417
or enter our dreams.

827
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:20,458
Everything safely here.

828
01:11:20,542 --> 01:11:23,417
We each memorize one,

829
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:25,500
and then we become the book.

830
01:11:25,583 --> 01:11:29,667
I am Toni Morrison.
"Song of Solomon."

831
01:11:29,750 --> 01:11:31,917
He's "The Letters of Van Gogh."

832
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,000
She's Chairman Mao,
"The Little Red Book."

833
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:39,542
She's Rumi, Darwin,
"Anna Karenina."

834
01:11:39,625 --> 01:11:42,333
And she's half of
"A Yellow Sun."

835
01:11:42,417 --> 01:11:44,750
She's still memorizing it.

836
01:11:44,834 --> 01:11:48,083
In fact, you've met
one of us already.

837
01:11:50,542 --> 01:11:52,792
You took this book
from her library.

838
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:56,542
She was John Steinbeck's
"The Grapes of Wrath"...

839
01:11:56,625 --> 01:12:00,250
now lost to humanity
forever.

840
01:12:00,333 --> 01:12:03,625
But maybe from her death
we will gain something.

841
01:12:03,709 --> 01:12:06,208
We haven't seen Clarisse
since she was a teen

842
01:12:06,291 --> 01:12:09,417
when she was here
with her parents.

843
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:14,000
I believe you were memorizing
"White Teeth."

844
01:12:15,542 --> 01:12:18,083
And she tells us
you want to help.

845
01:12:18,166 --> 01:12:21,834
We have an important task
for you related to the Omnis.

846
01:12:21,917 --> 01:12:25,083
But we have to be sure
about you.

847
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:28,458
Do you know this man?

848
01:12:28,542 --> 01:12:31,083
Fireman Hester.
Fourth District.

849
01:12:31,166 --> 01:12:34,500
That's right.
He's in the back room, waiting for you.

850
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:37,375
And you're gonna
have to kill him.

851
01:12:37,458 --> 01:12:39,792
Clarisse:
You never told me that.

852
01:13:04,709 --> 01:13:06,458
He's through that door.

853
01:13:07,959 --> 01:13:11,542
A revolution
is not a dinner party.

854
01:13:11,625 --> 01:13:13,250
Good luck.

855
01:13:29,125 --> 01:13:31,333
They need you, they need you.

856
01:14:07,166 --> 01:14:08,750
Stop!
Put it down!

857
01:14:08,834 --> 01:14:10,375
Hey, man,
what the fuck is this?

858
01:14:10,458 --> 01:14:13,792
You did it.
It's over.

859
01:14:13,875 --> 01:14:16,208
I'm James Baldwin.

860
01:14:16,291 --> 01:14:18,875
"The Fire Next Time."
Welcome.

861
01:15:06,917 --> 01:15:08,709
This way, please.

862
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:12,667
There's a young man,
Clifford,

863
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:13,750
in this barn,

864
01:15:13,834 --> 01:15:14,834
in transit to

865
01:15:14,917 --> 01:15:16,667
a group of scientists
in Canada,

866
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:18,458
and we need you to escort him

867
01:15:18,542 --> 01:15:19,834
over the border.

868
01:15:19,917 --> 01:15:22,458
His mother was a geneticist
behind the Omnis.

869
01:15:22,542 --> 01:15:25,291
Before she died,
she injected the DNA

870
01:15:25,375 --> 01:15:28,125
into Clifford's pet bird.

871
01:15:28,208 --> 01:15:30,667
Yes.

872
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:33,750
We need you to get
them both to safety.

873
01:15:37,917 --> 01:15:41,500
Woman: Clifford?
There's a man here to see you.

874
01:15:41,583 --> 01:15:44,333
Clifford:
Eight. Tagore, Gitanjali,

875
01:15:44,417 --> 01:15:45,709
and poems by Tagore.

876
01:15:45,792 --> 01:15:47,375
It's number eight.

877
01:15:47,458 --> 01:15:49,667
Clarisse:
Has he read all these books?

878
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:52,041
He's memorized
over 13,000 books.

879
01:15:52,125 --> 01:15:53,542
Clifford:
Pick up a book and test me.

880
01:15:53,625 --> 01:15:55,959
I won't look.
But you'll never win.

881
01:16:04,458 --> 01:16:07,500
Read the title.

882
01:16:09,375 --> 01:16:11,875
- "Remembrance of Things..."
- Remembrance of Things Past."

883
01:16:11,959 --> 01:16:14,333
Marcel Proust, 1927.

884
01:16:14,417 --> 01:16:17,875
3,031 pages, seven volumes,

885
01:16:17,959 --> 01:16:21,625
1,267,069 words.

886
01:16:21,709 --> 01:16:23,083
Open it.

887
01:16:24,583 --> 01:16:26,125
Open it.

888
01:16:31,417 --> 01:16:33,125
Page number... I'll turn around.

889
01:16:33,208 --> 01:16:34,875
No cheating. Page number?

890
01:16:34,959 --> 01:16:38,583
- Page 935.
- 935.

891
01:16:38,667 --> 01:16:40,500
Line 12. Go to line 12.

892
01:16:40,583 --> 01:16:43,083
"So, as long as you distract
your mind from its dreams,

893
01:16:43,166 --> 01:16:45,542
it will not know them
for what they are.

894
01:16:45,625 --> 01:16:48,917
You will always be taken in
by the appearance of things,

895
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,166
because you will not have
grasped their true nature.

896
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:53,750
If dreaming is dangerous,

897
01:16:53,834 --> 01:16:56,500
then the cure for it
is not to dream less,

898
01:16:56,583 --> 01:17:00,375
but to dream more,
to dream all the time."

899
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:03,625
Again, test...
test me again.

900
01:17:03,709 --> 01:17:05,000
You'll lose.

901
01:17:13,875 --> 01:17:15,417
Oh, can I show him Lennie?

902
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,750
Yes.

903
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:31,417
Hey.
This is Lennie.

904
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:35,500
My sturnidae,
from the Latin sturnus.

905
01:17:35,583 --> 01:17:38,709
Medium-sized passerine.
Very gregarious.

906
01:17:38,792 --> 01:17:41,458
Very beautiful.

907
01:17:41,542 --> 01:17:43,667
This is my Lennie.

908
01:17:49,375 --> 01:17:50,792
What's up, Lennie?

909
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,875
Montag:
So, what's the next step?

910
01:17:54,959 --> 01:17:56,834
We need a transponder.

911
01:17:56,917 --> 01:17:58,625
The scientists in Canada

912
01:17:58,709 --> 01:18:00,458
are transmitting a homing signal

913
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:02,291
that will call to a transponder.

914
01:18:02,375 --> 01:18:04,667
Can you get one
and come back tonight?

915
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:06,250
Yes.

916
01:18:06,333 --> 01:18:07,792
What are they gonna do
with the bird?

917
01:18:07,875 --> 01:18:11,000
They're waiting to extract
the DNA with the Omnis,

918
01:18:11,083 --> 01:18:12,208
duplicate it,

919
01:18:12,291 --> 01:18:14,834
and then inject
all other animals

920
01:18:14,917 --> 01:18:19,083
so that knowledge
can spread and multiply.

921
01:18:19,166 --> 01:18:20,792
And cover the world.

922
01:18:20,875 --> 01:18:22,709
You'd better hurry.

923
01:19:47,667 --> 01:19:49,875
Beatty:
Master Trooper.

924
01:19:55,542 --> 01:19:57,542
I wasn't expecting
to see you.

925
01:19:57,625 --> 01:20:00,208
Yeah.

926
01:20:00,291 --> 01:20:01,959
You were right.
I just needed to rest.

927
01:20:02,041 --> 01:20:04,458
- I'm feelin' 100 now.
- Beautiful.

928
01:20:04,542 --> 01:20:06,709
- So you're with us.
- Yes, sir.

929
01:20:06,792 --> 01:20:09,125
We need to find the Omnis.
Any leads?

930
01:20:09,208 --> 01:20:14,500
Yuxie, have Fireman Douglas
and his squad report.

931
01:20:14,583 --> 01:20:16,667
Raid time.
I'm ready to gear up.

932
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:23,834
What does two times two equal?

933
01:20:24,959 --> 01:20:26,375
Excuse me?

934
01:20:28,083 --> 01:20:29,750
Four.

935
01:20:29,834 --> 01:20:31,875
Why

936
01:20:35,166 --> 01:20:37,291
Is that all
you have to say to me?

937
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:39,542
Of course.

938
01:20:39,625 --> 01:20:42,333
John, just talk to me.
What's goin' on?

939
01:20:42,417 --> 01:20:45,750
I, too, burn with desire.

940
01:20:47,417 --> 01:20:52,083
But I would rather walk with
my brother in the darkness

941
01:20:52,166 --> 01:20:54,375
than go alone in the light.

942
01:20:54,458 --> 01:20:57,417
- Sir.
- Whatever happens tonight, Guy,

943
01:20:57,500 --> 01:21:01,625
you should know I would
rather walk with my brother.

944
01:21:07,083 --> 01:21:09,041
Douglas,
report, please.

945
01:21:10,083 --> 01:21:11,667
Found this
in the locker room, sir.

946
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:13,375
Beatty: Whose locker
did you find it in?

947
01:21:13,458 --> 01:21:15,166
Nobody's. It was
just on the floor.

948
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:17,125
Like a dead rat.

949
01:21:17,208 --> 01:21:18,625
Take it!

950
01:21:18,709 --> 01:21:20,417
That's an order.

951
01:21:22,125 --> 01:21:25,500
Go on. Read us
a bedtime story.

952
01:21:25,583 --> 01:21:27,041
Let's burn this shit.

953
01:21:27,125 --> 01:21:28,208
No, no, no, no, no, no.

954
01:21:28,291 --> 01:21:30,875
A special tip came
directly to me tonight.

955
01:21:30,959 --> 01:21:33,542
Might be a good lead
on the Omnis.

956
01:21:33,625 --> 01:21:36,625
But let's finish
this little business first.

957
01:21:36,709 --> 01:21:38,458
Open the book.

958
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:42,542
Oh, my.
Your pulse is really racing.

959
01:21:42,625 --> 01:21:45,875
Steady now, Montag.
I wouldn't want to burn your hand off.

960
01:21:45,959 --> 01:21:48,959
Now read.
Read to me.

961
01:21:50,917 --> 01:21:54,875
"To go wrong
in one's own way

962
01:21:54,959 --> 01:21:58,291
is better than to go right
in someone else's.

963
01:22:00,125 --> 01:22:04,750
Taking a new step,
uttering a new word...

964
01:22:07,792 --> 01:22:10,458
...is what people
fear the most."

965
01:22:10,542 --> 01:22:12,917
All those silly words,

966
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,917
those false promises,
the timeworn philosophies.

967
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:21,583
It's like chain-smoking,
chapter by chapter.

968
01:22:21,667 --> 01:22:25,208
- Go on. Don't stop reading to me.
- Sir.

969
01:22:25,291 --> 01:22:27,000
Next page!

970
01:22:31,041 --> 01:22:33,250
"Did you think
that one tiny crime...

971
01:22:35,208 --> 01:22:39,291
...would be wiped out
by thousands of good deeds?

972
01:22:39,375 --> 01:22:42,166
That there would be
no punishment?"

973
01:22:48,291 --> 01:22:50,375
A little knowledge
is a dangerous thing.

974
01:22:50,458 --> 01:22:53,208
You read a few lines,
and you're ready to blow up the world,

975
01:22:53,291 --> 01:22:55,834
chop heads off,
destroy authority.

976
01:22:55,917 --> 01:22:59,500
I know.
I've been through it all.

977
01:23:01,542 --> 01:23:04,333
Now, what do you want to do?

978
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:11,458
I want to burn.

979
01:23:11,542 --> 01:23:12,875
Hmm.

980
01:23:14,083 --> 01:23:16,750
Montag.

981
01:23:16,834 --> 01:23:17,959
My brother.

982
01:23:18,041 --> 01:23:19,583
Let's burn.

983
01:23:53,166 --> 01:23:54,959
Raven:
Good evening, Cleveland.

984
01:23:55,041 --> 01:23:57,083
Live outside
Master Trooper Montag's home

985
01:23:57,166 --> 01:23:59,291
where shocking events
are unfolding.

986
01:24:01,083 --> 01:24:04,083
Montag! Do you have anything
to say to your fans?

987
01:24:05,709 --> 01:24:06,750
Montag.

988
01:24:06,834 --> 01:24:09,583
Something the matter,
Montag?

989
01:24:13,542 --> 01:24:16,750
You wanted to fly
near the sun.

990
01:24:16,834 --> 01:24:19,583
You burn your damn wings off
and you wonder why.

991
01:24:21,458 --> 01:24:25,125
Go in. I'll give you a minute
to get your house in order.

992
01:24:26,875 --> 01:24:28,333
Go on.

993
01:24:34,959 --> 01:24:38,125
No one is lookin' out
for you now, boy.

994
01:24:57,417 --> 01:25:02,542
Yuxie: Hello, Montag.
This is rather unfortunate.

995
01:25:02,625 --> 01:25:04,667
Some people would like
to see you.

996
01:25:12,333 --> 01:25:15,417
That's quite a collection
of graffiti you have there.

997
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:18,208
Your fans deserve
an explanation.

998
01:25:18,291 --> 01:25:21,000
These aren't mine.
You set me up!

999
01:25:24,959 --> 01:25:27,917
Welcome, John.
I've been waiting for you.

1000
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,625
Yuxie, go dark.

1001
01:25:32,667 --> 01:25:36,750
I told you I would burn you
if you betrayed me.

1002
01:25:36,834 --> 01:25:39,291
And this...

1003
01:25:39,375 --> 01:25:41,709
this is the big dance.

1004
01:25:43,917 --> 01:25:45,500
Douglas. Stone.

1005
01:25:45,583 --> 01:25:49,333
Yuxie! Let the fire show begin.

1006
01:25:50,709 --> 01:25:54,792
Now, you do what
you are trained to do.

1007
01:25:54,875 --> 01:25:57,125
All you know how to do.

1008
01:25:57,208 --> 01:25:58,709
Burn.

1009
01:26:48,291 --> 01:26:51,125
You're not finished.
Go on.

1010
01:27:15,959 --> 01:27:18,125
Free yourself.

1011
01:27:49,333 --> 01:27:51,583
Let's light him up.

1012
01:27:51,667 --> 01:27:54,583
Tell your fans
what time it is.

1013
01:27:54,667 --> 01:27:56,917
All:
It's time to burn for America again!

1014
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,917
Say it, Montag.

1015
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,583
Say it!

1016
01:28:00,667 --> 01:28:02,333
Woman:
Spit it out! Come on!

1017
01:28:07,333 --> 01:28:08,625
Come on, Captain.

1018
01:28:13,166 --> 01:28:14,959
Why did you do this?

1019
01:28:15,041 --> 01:28:18,875
Chaos.

1020
01:28:26,333 --> 01:28:29,166
The Salamander
eats its own tail.

1021
01:28:31,709 --> 01:28:34,333
Master Trooper Douglas.

1022
01:28:34,417 --> 01:28:36,291
Master Trooper Douglas
reporting, sir.

1023
01:28:36,375 --> 01:28:39,291
- Tell us what you saw.
- Montag getting into a car

1024
01:28:39,375 --> 01:28:41,792
with Clarisse McClellan
and two known Eels.

1025
01:28:41,875 --> 01:28:44,041
Beatty:
No wonder you've been so eloquent lately.

1026
01:28:44,125 --> 01:28:47,083
But you're still
the same dog I raised,

1027
01:28:47,166 --> 01:28:51,000
just barking
at someone else's command.

1028
01:28:51,083 --> 01:28:53,667
Gather a squad,
find Clarisse and the other Eels

1029
01:28:53,750 --> 01:28:55,542
- and bring them to me.
- Yes, sir.

1030
01:28:57,917 --> 01:29:02,250
- Montag! Stop! Let it go! Drop it!
- Montag: Drop it, Douglas!

1031
01:29:02,333 --> 01:29:05,000
Well, that's one way
to win your fans back.

1032
01:29:05,083 --> 01:29:07,166
Beatty: Hold fire
till your brother speaks.

1033
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:09,208
- Drop it, Douglas.
- Beatty: Go ahead,

1034
01:29:09,291 --> 01:29:10,750
pull the trigger,
let Douglas have it.

1035
01:29:10,834 --> 01:29:12,417
- Captain.
- Quiet, Douglas!

1036
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:15,041
Could it be existence
is our exile

1037
01:29:15,125 --> 01:29:16,959
and nothingness is our home?

1038
01:29:17,041 --> 01:29:18,500
Fire is your home, Montag.

1039
01:29:18,583 --> 01:29:20,709
- Burn away.
- No, Captain, please!

1040
01:29:20,792 --> 01:29:23,583
What is called
a reason for living is also

1041
01:29:23,667 --> 01:29:26,250
an excellent reason
for dying.

1042
01:29:55,959 --> 01:29:58,917
Montag, you did it.

1043
01:30:00,291 --> 01:30:01,792
You did it.

1044
01:30:17,041 --> 01:30:18,792
Choice.

1045
01:30:34,125 --> 01:30:35,750
Beatty:
Dear Natives.

1046
01:30:35,834 --> 01:30:37,166
Eel Montag,

1047
01:30:37,250 --> 01:30:38,750
murderer Montag,

1048
01:30:38,834 --> 01:30:40,125
terrorist Montag,

1049
01:30:40,208 --> 01:30:43,917
has committed treason
against our nation.

1050
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,542
Eyes on Axis-Cam,
eyes on the 9,

1051
01:30:46,625 --> 01:30:48,291
and report where
this terrorist is.

1052
01:30:48,375 --> 01:30:51,583
Terrorist Montag...
could he have the Omnis?

1053
01:30:51,667 --> 01:30:53,667
Stay vivid to find out.

1054
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:16,917
Clarisse: They arrested him.

1055
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,041
Transponder?

1056
01:31:24,375 --> 01:31:27,542
- Page 93.
- 93.

1057
01:31:32,667 --> 01:31:36,250
"I bequeath myself
to the dirt

1058
01:31:36,333 --> 01:31:38,834
to grow from
the grass I love.

1059
01:31:38,917 --> 01:31:43,166
If you want me again,
look for me under your boot soles.

1060
01:31:43,250 --> 01:31:47,291
You will hardly know who I am
or what I mean,

1061
01:31:47,375 --> 01:31:50,333
but I shall be good help
to you nevertheless,

1062
01:31:50,417 --> 01:31:53,834
and filter and fiber
your blood.

1063
01:31:53,917 --> 01:31:57,834
Failing to fetch me at first,
keep encouraged.

1064
01:31:57,917 --> 01:32:01,583
Missing me one place,
search another.

1065
01:32:01,667 --> 01:32:05,667
I stop somewhere,
waiting for you."

1066
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:08,458
Yuxie: Found him.
He's heading to this black hole

1067
01:32:08,542 --> 01:32:09,834
outside Talay City.

1068
01:32:09,917 --> 01:32:12,750
Rerouting for
fastest arrival.

1069
01:32:25,792 --> 01:32:29,083
Clifford, run!

1070
01:32:29,166 --> 01:32:31,750
Clifford!

1071
01:33:16,750 --> 01:33:18,875
Male Eel: Get out of here!
Run! Run!

1072
01:33:18,959 --> 01:33:20,291
- Toni!
- Fireman: Don't you move!

1073
01:33:20,375 --> 01:33:23,792
- Get down!
- Get off of her!

1074
01:33:31,709 --> 01:33:35,959
Come on. Get up,
we gotta go.

1075
01:33:36,041 --> 01:33:37,333
Come on.

1076
01:33:59,208 --> 01:34:01,875
Fireman: Stand still!

1077
01:34:05,917 --> 01:34:09,834
Fireman: When I ask you not to move,
that means don't move!

1078
01:34:35,917 --> 01:34:37,667
Hey. Clifford.

1079
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:39,083
Hey. Come on.

1080
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:32,625
Omnis?

1081
01:35:37,750 --> 01:35:39,125
Stop.

1082
01:35:41,291 --> 01:35:43,875
I command you, Montag.

1083
01:35:43,959 --> 01:35:45,959
Stop.

1084
01:36:52,542 --> 01:36:55,375
( music playing,
no audible scream )
