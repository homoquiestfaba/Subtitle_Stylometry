00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:37,559
<i>How do you answer the question?</i>

2
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:40,333
<i>As you look at your life,</i>
<i>are you satisfied...</i>

3
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:43,069
<i>with what and</i>
<i>where you are in your life?</i>

4
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,373
<i>What do you want to be different?</i>

5
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,779
<i>I want to be free of my past.</i>
<i>I want to--</i>

6
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,080
<i>What comes to your mind?</i>
<i>What are your options?</i>

7
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:02,586
<i>That's the problem.</i>
<i>What do I do?</i>

8
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:07,759
<i>I can't get on with my life until</i>
<i>I can solve my past, then I can move on.</i>

9
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:11,531
<i>You have these nagging thoughts</i>
<i>that you did something terrible?</i>

10
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:16,108
<i>Has anybody ever</i>
<i>supported those thoughts?</i>

11
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,612
<i>-So this is all in your mind?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

12
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:27,208
Matty, what's up?

13
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,374
What's up, you rat bastard?

14
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,417
Where you goin'?

15
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:34,181
Lend me some money, man!

16
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,313
How ya doin', man?

17
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,357
I know you got it. Not that!

18
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:40,221
Have a Kiss!

19
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:31,002
<i>There he is, folks.</i>

20
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:35,647
The six-million-dollar movie man. I read
it in <i>Hollywood Reporter.</i> It's true.

21
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,377
I'm bored, Annie.
Tell us a joke.

22
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,248
You understand
if I speak in French?

23
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,015
We understand.

24
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:42,388
- In French.
- In French, you understand?

25
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,583
- In French.
- In French, you understand?

26
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,524
Yes, in French.

27
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:49,994
Come on. I like that.
Come on. For real.

28
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,629
Miami Beach.

29
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,769
I hate this guy.

30
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,940
Welcome home, Matty.

31
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:05,835
Yeah, and just when you thought
it was safe to go into the water.

32
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,346
Hey, lover boy.
What about your friends?

33
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,814
Jesus Christ.

34
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:15,376
They act like
they haven't seen each other.

35
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:18,686
- I missed you.
- Yeah? I missed you too, baby.

36
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,056
- It's impossible.
- Why?

37
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:24,920
Why is it impossible
for me to miss you?

38
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,933
Because I heard
you've been a bad dude.

39
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,526
You heard I was a what?
A bad dude?

40
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,935
It's not funny.

41
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,940
I got mine.

42
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:37,909
We're going upstairs.
Be jealous, huh?

43
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:41,435
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on. Don't show off.

44
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,949
What are you guys
staring at, huh?

45
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,781
- We saw you in the magazine.
- You're everywhere.

46
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,787
- Check it out.
- You are everywhere.

47
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,846
- That's not me. That's my brother.
- Your face is in every magazine.

48
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,288
Who's that girl?

49
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:56,852
- That's you with long hair.
- That's my mother.

50
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,828
Madonna was here.
She was looking for you. I swear to God.

51
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,563
She's finished with the basketball
player. She said, ''That Matty--

52
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,105
He's got a big--'' You know.

53
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,501
- The biggest.
- I swear to God.

54
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:12,567
- She knows.
- She goes, ''Where's Matty?''

55
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,978
Right? Right?
She was here a little while ago.

56
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:19,451
Annie, tell him.
Annie was gonna kick her ass.

57
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,454
Yeah, Matty, yeah.

58
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,821
- Matty, what about your friends?
- You got shades on and everything.

59
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,826
- Hey.
- He hasn't got time to talk.

60
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:31,523
You're not a fag, okay.
Come on. Talk to us.

61
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,827
We're rollin', Matty.

62
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,857
Come on. Do your thing.

63
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:39,336
- Come on, Romeo.
- Gonna be around more than a day?

64
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,703
I got you something.

65
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,833
Thank you.

66
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,504
Come on. Show us somethin'.

67
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:51,039
Now that's a kiss.
That's a real kiss. Yeah.

68
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,642
Watch and learn.

69
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,754
Hey. Leave her alone.

70
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:20,137
Like this. I can look like him.

71
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,892
Let me sleep.

72
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:35,012
Tell me this is--

73
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:37,181
Tell me this is
to our future together.

74
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,888
Okay.

75
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,193
To your future together.

76
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:50,066
No, to our future together.
To our future together.

77
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:52,627
To our future together.

78
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:54,639
That's right.

79
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,678
Drink it.

80
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:22,861
Why do you ask me now?
Why not before?

81
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,266
Because I was stupid.

82
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:30,302
I didn't know what I wanted.

83
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,043
Why did you ask me?

84
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,117
I know what I want now.

85
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:49,152
I want you. I want us.

86
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,951
I want us together.

87
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:55,289
I want this baby.
I want this baby.

88
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,594
<i>Motherfuck it</i>
<i>I'll get straight to the point</i>

89
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,934
<i>You don't dig what I'm sayin'</i>
<i>Then fuck you</i>

90
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,203
<i>'Cause sellin'drugs the only job</i>

00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,368
<i>Sellin' 'caine to the niggers</i>
<i>in the parkin'lot</i>

92
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,806
<i>Some niggers live</i>
<i>Some niggers gotta get dropped</i>

93
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,143
<i>You say damn, my man</i>
<i>You cannot understand</i>

94
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,342
<i>How could you be</i>
<i>so cold to the brotherman</i>

00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,783
<i>Don't come around here</i>

00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,050
<i>Because a nigger like me</i>

<i>That's why the young black men</i>
<i>always on the run</i>

105
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,818
All right.

106
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,692
Keep 'em happy. Keep 'em happy.

107
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:13,034
You don't know me. Yeah.
I know you. I know you!

108
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,300
Come on. Let's go.
I know you. I know you!

109
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:16,773
Cut! Cut!

110
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,811
Cut it! Cut it! Cut it!

111
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,245
All right. All right.

112
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:31,115
There are some times at Mickey Ray's,
man, when you have to be--

113
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,682
Silence! Silent.

114
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,991
'Cause we're shootin'
some serious shit here too, man.

115
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:42,467
We're makin' <i>Nana.</i>
Almost finished with <i>Nana Miami.</i>

116
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:49,902
But since film was
too expensive for us...

117
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:53,035
and we video artists,
as we like to call ourselves...

118
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:57,913
are gonna regenerate the world
and pay for our own film videos.

119
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,348
You know what I mean?

120
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:01,352
Vidiots that we are!

121
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,356
Freaks of the light!
Freaks of the light!

122
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:09,087
Freaks that record our own image.

123
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,925
Freaks that record
our own image, man.

124
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:14,329
Whoa! All right. All right!

125
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,334
You know,
and that green card, huh?

126
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:20,031
That green card gets you into the back
room. That red card get you in here.

127
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,472
You sign your waivers at the door.

128
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:27,103
That blue card gives you access to
the editing and to all the other rooms.

129
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:31,479
We got four live venues
goin' at all times here, brother.

130
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:35,145
- Tell us about the gold card!
- The gold card! Well, man!

131
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:39,055
The gold card gets you in bed.
You're in the picture, brother.

132
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,526
You're in the picture, or sister,
however it comes down.

133
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,821
Gold carder!

134
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:47,490
Music!

135
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:23,865
I understand what it is,
but do you understand what it is?

136
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,234
That's all I'm trying
to point out.

137
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,830
I understand,
but do you understand?

138
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,399
Isn't that fuckin' simple?
Isn't that fuckin' simple or what?

139
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:35,846
Am I going nuts here?
So, anyway, in order--

140
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,247
Can we just-- Forget that.
Forget that. It's over.

141
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,114
It doesn't matter
what you think!

142
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,416
I know I fucked up!
I'm saying I fucked up!

143
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:47,152
How could I listen to you tell me I
didn't fuck up? I fucked up! All right?

144
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,888
- What do you want to do about it?
- How the fuck do I know?

145
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,857
- You think I know?
- That's absurd.

146
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,161
- Hey!
- How you doin', man?

147
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:58,101
- How'd the film go?
- Which one?

148
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,035
Flavor-of-the-month guy, huh?

149
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,563
- All right.
- Me? Flavor-of-the-month guy?

150
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:05,075
- That's right.
- You fucker you.

151
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,374
My star.
This is my star.

152
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,177
You better fuckin'--
Get the fuck outta here with that!

153
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:14,276
Wait. We're makin' a movie, man.

154
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,254
We're makin' a movie here.
Keep me out of it, will ya?

155
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,951
- I'm makin' a movie.
- Get the fuck outta here.

156
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,051
-He's been following me since I came in!
-He's filming her, man.

157
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:26,029
He's filming her.
We're making a movie.

158
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:28,965
You want to be in the movie, great.
Otherwise, stay away from us.

159
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:32,470
You gotta stay away from us. And you
can't be the star of the movie either.

160
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,870
- Why?
- You gotta do everything I tell you.

161
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,874
Because somebody else is the star.

162
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,876
I am the star.

163
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:44,609
The truth, brother.

164
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:49,086
Godard says 2 4 frames a minute.
Or is it a second?

165
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:52,089
- It's a second, isn't it?
- Twenty-four frames a second.

166
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,318
- You sure?
- Yeah.

167
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,326
- What is she doing?
- It's the future is what it is.

168
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,123
She's starring in my movie, man.

169
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:59,289
It's video, man.

170
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:02,129
- Yeah, video.
- Video is the future.

171
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,964
Video is the future.

172
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:21,245
The star, baby.
You could costar with her.

173
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,151
Got a part for you
in this picture.

174
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,655
Wanna sign?

175
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:28,386
You're not gonna be able
to see her otherwise.

176
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,950
Really.

177
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:43,758
They are happy.
Everybody's happy.

178
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,337
This is good for you.

179
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:56,206
Matty is happy.
Everybody is happy.

180
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,814
You think I love you?

181
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,487
I know you love me.

182
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,352
- You know?
- I know you love me.

183
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:10,116
I know you love me
when I touch you like this.

184
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:14,394
Everybody in the world
can do that.

185
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,559
No one does it like me.

186
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:19,832
Yes, that. Everybody
can do that like you.

187
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:21,530
Yes.

188
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,131
Oh, yes.

189
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:29,207
I do that alone,
and I feel the same thing.

190
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:31,476
I don't need that.

191
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,816
I love you so much.

192
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,594
You want somethin'?

193
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:06,708
I told you about Mickey, right?

194
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,613
The moment of awe.

195
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:14,618
He's telling me
about the moment of--

196
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:20,447
He's called this prostitute
up in the room.

197
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:23,393
And he's in a hotel.

198
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,692
The doorman rings him up and says...

199
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,892
''There's a girl here to see you.''

200
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:30,526
So he says, ''Send her up.''

201
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,199
She comes up to his room.

202
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:41,645
And she knocks on the door.

203
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,874
- Please listen.
- And he's there.

204
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,713
Do you want to marry me
because I was still pregnant?

205
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:48,309
Listen to me.

206
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,692
Would you like to come in?

207
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,696
Would you like to--

208
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:04,361
Would you like to have a drink...

209
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:08,202
or would you just like to
give me a blow job right now?

210
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,903
Did you want to marry me
because I was still pregnant?

211
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:38,661
Did you have an abortion?

212
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,397
Did you have an abortion?

213
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:47,343
I don't want my baby to have a father
who was a junkie. Do you understand?

214
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:51,712
Who's a junkie?
Who you talkin' about?

215
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,819
- You told me--
- Did you have an abortion?

216
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:57,821
- You told me to have it.
- Did you have an abortion?

217
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:01,825
Yes, but you told me
to have an abortion. It's yours!

218
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:10,925
You had an abortion?

219
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,937
What did it feel like?
What did it feel like?

220
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,639
What did it feel like
to have an abortion?

221
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:27,014
What did it feel like
to have an abortion?

222
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,076
Why would you fuckin' cut my--

223
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:15,560
I wouldn't say that.
I wouldn't say that!

224
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,894
I would never say
somethin' like that!

225
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:23,600
What the fuck did you think
I came down here for?

226
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:40,389
You fuckin' bitch!

227
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:44,623
<i>If you were any kind of woman,you'd</i>
<i>take a knife and cut that baby out</i>!

228
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:47,996
Why did you go and cut a baby
out of your fuckin' guts for?

229
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:53,402
<i>You know what? Better yet. I'll take a</i>
<i>knife and cut it out for you, all right?</i>

230
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:57,973
<i>Who knows what kind of fuckin'diseased</i>
<i>dicks have been inside your cunt?</i>

231
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,408
<i>You fuckin'--</i>

232
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:03,808
That ain't me.

233
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:08,819
<i>Yeah, I heard about</i>
<i>all the guys you been fuckin'.</i>

234
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,117
- Come on!
<i>- It's all over Hollywood.</i>

235
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:15,182
- That ain't me. I was--
<i>- You fuckin'cunt. Who you fuckin'?</i>

236
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:19,523
<i>Why don't you tell me</i>
<i>who you been fuckin'?</i>

237
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:21,964
<i>Because it ain't my baby.</i>

238
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,935
<i>It ain't my baby.</i>
<i>Who knows who you been with?</i>

239
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:27,096
Just talkin' to a friend, you know?
We were--

240
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:31,006
<i>- Yeah, that's right.</i>
- We were rehearsing.

241
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,102
- You know, I was playin'.
<i>- What am I talkin'to you for?</i>

242
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:37,080
<i>What am I talkin'to you for?</i>

243
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,982
<i>It's a waste of time.</i>

244
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:43,215
<i>Fuck you. Fuck the baby.</i>
<i>Fuck everything.</i>

245
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:47,448
<i>I don't care if I ever see you again</i>
<i>the rest of my life</i>! <i>Understand me?</i>

246
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,687
<i>I don't care if I ever see you.</i>

247
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,695
<i>And fuck you.</i>

248
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,511
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

249
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:09,776
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

250
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:13,079
There you go. Oh, yeah.

251
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,085
Whoa.

252
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:21,081
Keep it movin' in here.
Keep it goin'.

253
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,856
Kate? Does this thing come down?

254
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,728
We have to load this
from the top with her.

255
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:31,098
She can't be pulled up on this.
Is that right?

256
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:34,104
- Right.
- Okay, yeah, well, that's a problem.

257
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:36,572
We got five cameras
going in various places...

258
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,041
on these big screens
all around that you can see.

259
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,876
We're rackin' the money in
comin' in...

260
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:45,246
gettin' the people comin' in
and then we, you know--

261
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,146
If they want to pay more,
they can be in the film themselves.

262
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,245
We have live acts
goin' on all the time.

263
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:53,481
We can run silent here,
and everybody can stop talkin'.

264
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:55,992
We can shoot a picture over here.

265
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,926
-Hey, Matt.
-We're makin' another movie called <i>Nana.</i>

266
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,759
Ever see <i>Nana,</i> the old French film?

267
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,799
- You all right?
- I'm all right.

268
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:04,097
- You seen Annie?
- No, man.

269
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,694
- Is this bar open?
- Yeah, what do you want?

270
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:09,535
This is a whole functioning,
like, film place.

271
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:11,803
Something cold.

272
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:14,744
That's what we're selling.
That's the theme of the place.

273
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:17,043
We're gonna generate
movies outta here.

274
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:18,515
Something wet.

275
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,541
You'd be lucky to get
into the basement door.

276
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:25,545
Keep it fluid. Don't make it too jumpy
and, you know, too erratic.

277
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,649
Keep it flowin'. It's lookin' good.

278
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:31,184
- Erotic, not erratic.
- Yeah, erotic, not erratic. Good.

279
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:35,931
Could you start it
from the top, please?

280
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:41,904
I don't want this to look
too much like a gong show here.

281
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:47,139
I want this sexy and hot. I'm gettin'
high-payin' high rollers in here.

282
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,271
Let loose of the tits
with a brain or somethin'!

283
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:51,781
We're not even talkin'!
Fuck it! Hey!

284
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,784
You got the nerve to tell me
about cheating on my husband...

285
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:57,288
when you haven't taken your eyes
off these fuckin' bosoms.

286
00:25:57,355 --> 00:26:00,813
Right. I chase--
That's all I do all day.

287
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,258
- I fuckin' chase women, right?
- Touch them. Smell them. Taste them.

288
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:05,125
- I'm fuckin' Madeline!
- I know.

289
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:07,960
- And you're fucking humiliating her--
- Bullshit!

290
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:10,558
Excuse me! Excuse me!

291
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:14,696
We're makin' film here!
This is all over the big screen here!

292
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:18,869
Time out! Time out!
I'm directing! This is my club!

293
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,901
I want it quiet!

294
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:25,275
Make this work related.
Use it. Use it.

295
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,318
Don't spew it all over here.

296
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:33,915
All right. Come on over here.
Move this.

297
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,290
- Recognize this guy, huh?
- Yeah.

298
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:42,731
Matty, the movie star.
Couldn't keep him outta the frame.

299
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:46,134
You gonna be in the movie?

300
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,798
- Yeah, I'm gonna be in this movie.
- Let's ask the editor.

301
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:53,002
You know what I mean?
He's fantastic.

302
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,046
I'm glad to have him on board.

303
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,138
One point, 25,000 in the club.

304
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:59,649
One point for the movie, 50,000.

305
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:01,652
7 5,000, you can be on the boat.

306
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,712
1 00,000, I'll put you in the movie.
Think it over, Pete.

307
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,986
I got a long list. Let me know.

308
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:12,091
- Oh, man.
- Hey.

309
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,289
Where's Annie?

310
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,835
How the fuck would I know?
I left her with you.

311
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:21,167
She's the star of your movie. How can
you make the movie without Annie?

312
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:24,936
I left her with you.
Where is she?

313
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,944
Let me ask you a question.

314
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,910
You sleepin' with her?

315
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:38,747
Which would make you feel worse?
If I say yes or no?

316
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:45,225
Are you fucking her?

317
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:48,094
No, I'm fucking you.

318
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:50,931
No, I'm fucking you.
What do you mean, am I fuckin' her?

319
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:54,301
Give me a fuckin' answer.
Come on.

320
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:57,466
- Did you fuck her? Come on.
- Listen to me.

321
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:59,904
- It's not a question of did I--
- Did you fuck her?

322
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:04,347
It's not a question of did I?
It's, do I remember?

323
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:07,749
But more importantly...

324
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,980
do you fuckin' remember?

325
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:14,282
Think on it.

326
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:17,317
- Let's go for a drive.
- Don't be pullin' on me.

327
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:19,329
- Let's go for a ride.
- You got wheels?

328
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:21,797
Yeah, man, look at this.

329
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:25,825
- I got a new one.
- Okay, cool. I'll drive.

330
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:27,428
Let's go.

331
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:29,029
Come on.

332
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:39,940
<i>I wanted that fuckin'baby, man.</i>

333
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:42,851
That baby meant that
we had something that was real...

334
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,946
that we weren't
just fuckin' around...

335
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:49,153
that we were capable
of creating something that was--

336
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:53,254
Why would I-- Why would I--
I wouldn't do that, man.

337
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:04,865
Annie's the one, man.
I mean, you ever been married?

338
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:07,275
Both of us.
We've never been married.

339
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:09,745
Both of our parents
were married one time.

340
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:13,443
Both of us were the only child
in the whole family.

341
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:16,946
I'm telling you, man.
It's like parallel lives.

342
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:21,424
Annie's-- She's like the other half
of me. Dig what I'm sayin'?

343
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:25,930
She's gonna come back.
She has to.

344
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:28,465
Fuck.

345
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:31,263
Do you ever think
that in this world...

346
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:35,830
there's somebody out there
that's a perfect match for you?

347
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,971
That's what Annie is for me, man.

348
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:43,071
It's just bullshit.
It's just bullshit, man.

349
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:52,082
Why would I tell her
that I didn't want to have the kid?

350
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,091
Why would I--

351
00:29:57,862 --> 00:29:59,830
I wouldn't say that.

352
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,860
You get it.
I'm not gettin' up. You go get it.

353
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:11,370
Come on! Open up!

354
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:14,006
Who is it?

355
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,410
Come on!

356
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:22,185
- Hey!
- Hi. I'm Jasmine.

357
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,381
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

358
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:27,947
Gold card, all right.

359
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:30,460
All right. You dance?

360
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:32,587
You got any beer?
How ya doin'?

361
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:36,190
- Dafney.
- Dafney. My pleasure.

362
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:38,929
She wouldn't dance in the club.

363
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,164
That was when I first started.
I remember. I never forget.

364
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,834
I'm gettin' an idea here.
This thing woofs.

365
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:47,140
Some chicks have poodles.
They walk their dogs.

366
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:49,146
It's a party, all right.

367
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:52,243
- Animal.
- Director is God.

368
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:55,218
Yeah, a director is born.

369
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:59,553
- Put that fuckin' camera away.
- I'm lookin' at you guys.

370
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:02,650
Could you start that again?
I had a little boggle.

371
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:04,862
A little boggle?

372
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:06,864
Do you like this?

373
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,532
You girls done this before?

374
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:16,438
Oh, man. Go ahead.
Keep rubbing, baby. Rub it, baby.

375
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:19,374
All right, now make her nipples hard.
Make her nipples hard.

376
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,277
Look at that.
I didn't know you had that. Wow.

377
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:27,350
Experience how
beautiful it is, man.

378
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:30,251
Experience how beautiful it is.

379
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:33,222
That's sweet.
That's really sweet.

380
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,360
- Isn't that beautiful?
- Wow.

381
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,362
Spank her.
Give her a little spank.

382
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,261
Give her a little spank.
Come on. Yeah.

383
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:42,891
Make it pink.
Come on. Let's make it pink.

384
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:46,698
Give it to her.
Come on. Slap her. Come on.

385
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,203
A little bit more. Come on.
There you go. All right.

386
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,232
Say something.
Say, '' Fuck me, baby.''

387
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:55,075
- Fuck me, baby.
- Fuck me, baby. Say--

388
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:57,512
Fuck, shit, cocksucker,
motherfucker.

389
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,709
I feel like
I'm in a vampire movie.

390
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:03,179
A vampire movie, eh?

391
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:06,382
- You're pullin' my hair.
- Yeah, I know that.

392
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:08,948
Hey, wait a minute.
Slow down.

393
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:11,928
A man saying slow down. Okay.

394
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:18,033
Let me see this.
Positioning is hard.

395
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:22,365
Arch your back.
Arch your back.

396
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,603
Arch your back. This way.
Push up. Push up.

397
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,975
There you go.
Let me see that. That's incredible.

398
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,980
Wait a second.

399
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,640
Where's my fuckin' camera?

400
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,482
Okay, I--

401
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:09,015
Sweetheart, what's wrong?

402
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:15,350
What's wrong?
You don't want to party?

403
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:21,364
Come on.
You need to relax. Come on.

404
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,467
What's wrong with you?

405
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,105
Come on. I can relax you.

406
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:42,176
What'd you stop for?

407
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,578
Will you answer me, please?

408
00:34:56,828 --> 00:35:00,127
Big Foot?
Big Foot or what, huh?

409
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,328
That's very nice.

410
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:08,862
You don't mind, dude, if I just get one
fuckin' shot of you in those glasses.

411
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:16,440
Am I live out there?
Am I hooked up back here?

412
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:21,315
I hope to hell I'm hooked up back here!
Am I hooked up back there?

413
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:25,482
I can't get out of these French novels!
These French novelists.

414
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:27,524
These playwrights, these novels.

415
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:29,924
All right, so, here we are.

416
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:32,493
Get a close-up.

417
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:34,258
- Is this camera hooked up?
- Yes!

418
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,698
- Am I live out there?
- Yes!

419
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:40,366
<i>Nana's</i> almost finished.

420
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:44,373
<i>Balcony</i> is about to begin.

421
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:48,742
- Fantasy one, take two.
- That's real. This here is jive.

422
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,678
This is symbolic jive.

423
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,713
Hit it hard. Hit it loud.
Go for it.

424
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:06,557
<i>It was a boy, Matty.</i>

425
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,487
<i>It was a boy, Matty.</i>

426
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,498
Are you okay?
Can I get you something?

427
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:33,682
May I have a cup of coffee?

428
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:01,538
I loved you in your last movie.

429
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:05,539
You're one of my favorite actors.

430
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:08,810
Is your name Annie?

431
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:11,446
That's my name.

432
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:17,493
I'm so nervous.
I never get nervous.

433
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:29,806
<i>You made me have the abortion.</i>

434
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:36,335
You made me have the abortion.

435
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:43,513
<i>You made me.</i>

436
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:46,818
<i>It was a boy, Matty.</i>

437
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:59,560
So what are you doing in Miami?

438
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:04,374
I came here to meet you.

439
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:14,551
Wanna get outta here?

440
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:18,021
<i>When do you get off?.</i>

441
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:22,123
<i>Now.</i>

442
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:25,518
<i>Shall we?</i>

443
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:29,456
<i>Let's go.</i>

444
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:52,450
''I can't help it.

445
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:54,457
It's a fixation.''

446
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:04,929
None of this is real.

447
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,572
Annie! Meet the new Annie!

448
00:40:14,645 --> 00:40:16,670
- Annie?
- That's my name.

449
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:19,011
- How are you?
- Good.

450
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,142
You're doin' great, huh?

451
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:24,085
<i>Who's the leader of the club</i>
<i>that's made for you and me</i>

452
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:26,089
You like to watch yourself
in dailies.

453
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:29,217
Most directors don't like their actors
watchin' themselves in dailies.

454
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,519
I think that's bullshit.

455
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,860
You gotta see the good with the bad,
right? See the good with the bad.

456
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,628
Know when your acting is shit.
Know when you're faking it.

457
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:40,034
Know when you're fuckin' lyin'.

458
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,095
- Want to be in pictures?
- Hey.

459
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:44,573
<i>You want to be in pictures</i>
Come on.

460
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:47,475
Everybody wants to be in pictures.
Don't they?

461
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:48,773
- Do they?
- Sure.

462
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:50,006
Really. Hey.

463
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,480
- You want to be an actress?
- I want to be an actress?

464
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,815
- You want to be an actress?
- Yeah.

465
00:40:55,853 --> 00:40:58,515
You're beautiful.
Look at you.

466
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:01,023
Look at you. All right, huh?

467
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,458
- You're pretty.
- Thank you.

468
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:07,020
I'm sure everybody
tells you that, huh?

469
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:11,227
Huh? Yeah. Very, very pretty.
Very nice.

470
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:15,630
Oh, yeah. Got that spark.

471
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:18,038
Hey, Matt? Matty?

472
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:22,044
I got a terrific idea.
Listen, he's wasted.

473
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:24,546
Come with me.
You wanna smoke a joint?

474
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,976
- Sure. I'll smoke a joint.
- Cool. Let's go.

475
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:42,493
- Wow! This stuff is cool!
- Fuckin' playground, huh?

476
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:44,534
What kind of movies
do you do? Wow.

477
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:47,969
- Good ones. Put this on.
- Put this on.

478
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:50,063
You said you never wanted
to be an actress, huh?

479
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,165
- Well--
- Sit down.

480
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,871
- I did a play in high school.
- How were ya?

481
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:58,108
I think I was very, very good.

482
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:01,583
- How's that?
- You're gonna scare the shit outta him.

483
00:42:01,652 --> 00:42:03,586
- Fuckin' terrific.
- Really?

484
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,713
It's fuckin' great.

485
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:10,193
- You look just like Annie, baby.
- I am Annie.

486
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:13,128
You're Annie 2.
There's an Annie 1 .

487
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:16,792
- Annie 1 ?
- Yeah. Anyway--

488
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:21,570
- Do I look okay?
- You look fabulous.

489
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,904
You look really good.

490
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:28,001
- Do you like him a lot?
- Do I like Matty?

491
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:29,807
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

492
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,748
You in love with him, huh?

493
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:36,718
Maybe. I don't know.
I just met him.

494
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:40,147
- Okay, go wow him, baby.
- He's gonna like it?

495
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:43,022
You go wow him, okay?

496
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:47,797
Knock him dead.

497
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:06,047
We got another Annie in this film.
You know that, huh?

498
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:10,319
Do you like it?

499
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:25,230
Wait now. You don't need that.
You don't need that.

500
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:27,896
It's okay. It's okay, yeah.

501
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:34,302
Be the little waitress that you are.

502
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:37,176
Hey.

503
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:39,181
Why did you leave me?

504
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:41,649
- Come on.
- Hey.

505
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,653
I missed you so much.

506
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:50,651
It's okay.

507
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:54,129
I missed you so much.
Oh, baby.

508
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,200
Why did you leave me?

509
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:01,101
I'm right here. Hey.

510
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:09,375
It's time for us
to shoot the scene.

511
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:12,348
All that shit that
you got on tape and this.

512
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:15,112
We're just gonna do it.
We're gonna do it right now.

513
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,414
Just hang in there.

514
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,954
<i>It's gonna be fuckin'great.</i>

515
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:28,888
<i>Do you believe in fate?</i>

516
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:32,060
<i>When you walked</i>
<i>into that restaurant...</i>

517
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:34,662
<i>I just got all these shivers.</i>

518
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:37,002
<i>My whole body shook.</i>

519
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:42,444
<i>I just knew that something</i>
<i>really big was about to happen.</i>

520
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:50,214
<i>I don't know. I thought maybe</i>
<i>I wasn't gonna be alone anymore.</i>

521
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:52,016
<i>You'll never be alone again.</i>

522
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:55,217
<i>Are you acting?</i>

523
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:58,455
<i>I ain't acting.</i>
<i>What the fuck is acting anyway?</i>

524
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,426
<i>I don't know the difference</i>
<i>between life and acting anymore.</i>

525
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:02,989
<i>You know what I'm saying?</i>

526
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:06,798
<i>It's all started to blur together.</i>
<i>It's just a big blur.</i>

527
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:22,709
<i>Listen to me.</i>

528
00:45:23,954 --> 00:45:27,390
<i>You want to marry me</i>
<i>because I was still pregnant?</i>

529
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:34,757
<i>I don't want my baby to have</i>
<i>a father who is a junkie.</i>

530
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,969
All right. Hey. Hey.

531
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,738
You're in the movie, right?

532
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:48,107
I don't want to waste a lot of film,
if you're not in the movie.

533
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:51,046
This is really important to me.
You gonna be in it or not?

534
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:53,081
Oh, man.

535
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:56,176
<i>- What?</i>
<i>- Where's Annie?</i>

536
00:45:56,253 --> 00:46:00,189
<i>We're gonna find her.</i>
<i>We're gonna find her for you.</i>

537
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:03,792
There she is. She's right there.
She's right there.

538
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:06,022
Hey. It's okay.

539
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:08,961
You didn't have
an abortion, right?

540
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:10,897
I can do whatever I want.

541
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:28,511
<i>My name is Matty.</i>

542
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:32,487
<i>I'm an alcoholic and drug addict.</i>

543
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:37,050
It's been the longest year
of my life.

544
00:46:46,336 --> 00:46:51,035
The wonderful thing about
being an actor is you get a script.

545
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:54,100
You know what it is
you're supposed to say.

546
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:59,504
It's kind of hard for me
to tell you my story...

547
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,347
because I don't know
where it began.

548
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:08,387
I suppose it started
when I was 1 5 years old...

549
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:11,927
with my grandmother.

550
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:16,830
She used to keep a big bottle
of vodka in her closet, and I'd--

551
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:21,069
I'd sneak in there
and watch her drink it...

552
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:24,369
and wonder what her fascination
with that bottle was.

553
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:28,470
<i>There's lots</i>
<i>of opportunities to--</i>

554
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,605
- Thanks.
<i>- use...</i>

555
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:37,617
<i>forbidden illegal substances</i>
<i>on motion picture movie sets.</i>

556
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:43,490
<i>Because of their</i>
<i>availability and...</i>

557
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:48,621
<i>acceptance</i>
<i>that it was sort of...</i>

558
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:52,427
<i>something that was okay to do,</i>
<i>I started to do that myself.</i>

559
00:47:54,104 --> 00:47:57,369
<i>I didn't think I ever</i>
<i>recognized it as a problem...</i>

560
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:03,938
<i>until I started finding it hard</i>
<i>to look at myself in the mirror...</i>

561
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:08,550
<i>'cause I didn't know who</i>
<i>I was lookin'at anymore.</i>

562
00:48:13,457 --> 00:48:15,652
So how'd it go?

563
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:21,931
Where's the water?

564
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:27,265
I'll go back out.
I'll go get it.

565
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:31,130
- Let me go back.
- You only bought stuff for yourself.

566
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:33,176
Well, I forgot. I'm sorry.

567
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,211
I'll go back out and get it now.

568
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:37,713
All right. Stay here first.

569
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:44,210
Get the coin or not?

570
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:47,415
- You did?
- They tell you everything?

571
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:49,186
No, not everything.

572
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,227
How do you know
that I got a coin?

573
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,126
Well, it's one year, right?

574
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:55,622
Here you go.

575
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:57,189
- That's it?
- Yeah.

576
00:48:57,234 --> 00:49:00,499
- My Olympic medal.
- That's one year sober.

577
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:02,162
Like this.

578
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:04,230
- It's real, right?
- Yeah.

579
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:07,106
- That's really cool.
- ''To thine own self be true.''

580
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:11,646
So, you proud of yourself?

581
00:49:15,218 --> 00:49:18,016
- Yeah, I'm proud, yeah.
- Yeah.

582
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:22,389
So, you gonna be good
when I'm gone?

583
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,324
Where you goin'?

584
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:29,093
You know, I gotta go on this trip
tomorrow for three days.

585
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:31,998
You gonna be good?

586
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:33,400
Three days?

587
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:40,710
Of course, I'll be good.

588
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:43,178
- Promise?
- I promise.

589
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:23,150
Did you ever think about
seein' a psychiatrist?

590
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,211
Maybe after I'm through
with your therapy.

591
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:27,553
You got an office
down here in a bunker.

592
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:31,550
I think I could find Hitler
hidin' around here someplace.

593
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,066
Have you ever declared
your love to her?

594
00:50:39,102 --> 00:50:43,539
Yeah. It's funny that I should
send her letters and try to--

595
00:50:43,607 --> 00:50:45,575
I've tried to let her
off the hook...

596
00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:50,739
so that she doesn't have to feel
responsible for the things she did.

597
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:56,515
We can get on with our life,
but she--

598
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,187
How old is your mother?

599
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:07,787
She doesn't write me back.
She doesn't call me.

600
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:11,425
She doesn't--
She's not willing to--

601
00:51:12,636 --> 00:51:14,831
So, she's like Annie?

602
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,465
Now that you mention it,
she is a bit like her.

603
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:20,840
- How old is your mom?
- Sixty-four.

604
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,410
Have you had thoughts about the day
when she would die?

605
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:25,415
Absolutely.

606
00:51:25,449 --> 00:51:27,576
How do you feel about that?

607
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:31,883
I feel like it would be a relief...

608
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:34,818
that she'd finally be off the hook.

609
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:38,523
What was different about
your relationship with Annie...

610
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:41,325
than your relationship with Susan?

611
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:44,162
Susan doesn't get high.
Susan doesn't drink.

612
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:47,226
Susan doesn't-- Susan doesn't--

613
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:53,241
She's like a health food store.

614
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:56,108
She's like a health food store.

615
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:58,147
So what do you think about that?

616
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:01,542
It's healthy.

617
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:03,609
So you don't think
very much of it?

618
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,722
You dismiss her?

619
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,452
I don't dismiss her.
I appreciate her.

620
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:11,790
But you're sarcastic
when you refer to her.

621
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:13,352
Yeah.

622
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:16,866
So there's a part of you that
wants to bury Annie once and for all?

623
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:18,298
Yeah.

624
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:20,427
How do you want to do that?

625
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:24,699
I want her to say good-bye.
I want her to--

626
00:52:24,774 --> 00:52:29,905
I want her to cut that cord.

627
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:32,342
I want her to cut
that umbilical cord.

628
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:35,145
So she's got to do it, not you?

629
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:37,846
- You're the passive one here.
- Well, yeah.

630
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:39,354
- What?
- Yeah.

631
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:41,652
Do you consider yourself
a passive person?

632
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:44,558
A baby doesn't cut
his own cord, does he?

633
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:47,153
You're the helpless baby?

634
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:49,164
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Yeah?

635
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:51,723
So you don't want
to take charge of your life?

636
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:53,462
- I can't--
- I can't?

637
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,869
I don't have the tools
to cut the cord.

638
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:57,668
Annie has the tools?

639
00:54:41,645 --> 00:54:43,010
What is it?

640
00:54:48,051 --> 00:54:49,541
What is it?

641
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:03,789
Honey, what is it?

642
00:55:25,689 --> 00:55:29,785
When I was a little girl,
I also had bad dreams.

643
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:33,892
My grandmother
took me to church.

644
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:37,525
It was really scary,
because it was really dark...

645
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:41,003
and there was a priest
with a long beard.

646
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:43,505
He really scared me.

647
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:47,475
And he put his big, black robe
around me, you know.

648
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:53,782
And he read the Bible to me,
and all my bad dreams went away.

649
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:57,885
You think I should go
to see a priest?

650
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:02,857
Well, you could tell me.
Maybe it'll help.

651
00:56:30,854 --> 00:56:32,378
Tell me.

652
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:45,824
Tell me. You can tell me.

653
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:47,836
Yes, you can.

654
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:53,607
Please, Matty. Tell me.

655
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:00,539
Come on.

656
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:35,842
<i>Why did you come?</i>
<i>Why are you here?</i>

657
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:44,017
<i>'Cause I'm having bad dreams.</i>

658
00:57:46,696 --> 00:57:48,630
<i>What are those dreams like?</i>

659
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,795
<i>They're dreams of death.</i>

660
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:56,100
Dreams of--

661
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:58,266
Very violent dreams.

662
00:57:58,508 --> 00:58:02,137
When you say violent,
in what way are they violent?

663
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:08,675
I say and do things in the dreams...

664
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:16,255
that I know I wouldn't do,
that I know I'm not capable of doing.

665
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:20,895
But they're so real
and so vivid that...

666
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:26,695
they feel as though
I've actually done them.

667
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:29,567
Can you give me an example
of a dream like that?

668
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:33,675
What's the last dream you've had
that was upsetting?

669
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:40,814
That Annie was pregnant...

670
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:42,249
and I--

671
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:49,952
that I...

672
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:52,995
took my hands and...

673
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:58,033
choked her to death.

674
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:02,136
So, in your mind
you're a murderer.

675
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,799
Not in my mind.
In my nightmares.

676
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:06,239
In your nightmares.

677
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:11,344
If I could just speak to her--
If you could get her to call here--

678
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:14,039
- She doesn't want to speak to you.
- Why?

679
00:59:14,117 --> 00:59:19,054
I don't know, but it's obvious.
So she's out of your life.

680
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:21,215
But you're hanging onto
this painful thought.

681
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:24,226
Not only are you missing her
and feeling the pain of that...

682
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:26,228
but you're going yourself
one better--

683
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:28,821
you're telling yourself
that you killed her.

684
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:32,827
Maybe that's what I want to do.

685
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,836
That's a nice intellectualization.

686
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:37,134
That way I could get her
out of my life.

687
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:41,074
If I could just kill the bitch,
then she'd be gone.

688
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:43,203
You already think you did.

689
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:45,213
Where are you gonna find Annie?

690
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:49,082
Miami.

691
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:51,086
Is that a question or an answer?

692
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:54,089
Miami is an answer.
Maybe she's still down there.

693
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:56,387
What prevents you
from going to Miami?

694
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:57,991
Nothing.

695
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:00,263
What do you mean, 90 percent of my work
is seen on television?

696
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:03,027
What do you mean, 90 percent of my work
is seen on television?

697
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:08,002
Yeah, after it comes out on video
and the ABC, NBC, CBS bullshit.

698
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:11,370
I'm flattered that he came to me first,
but I don't give a shit.

699
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,906
When was the last time
one of his movies made any money?

700
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:17,413
And now you're trying to push me into
a TV series so I don't have a career.

701
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:20,241
Look at the people I've worked with.
Have I ever cared about money?

702
01:00:20,316 --> 01:00:24,685
Why would I start being interested
in money at this point in my life?

703
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:26,814
Seventy-five grand a week?

704
01:00:26,889 --> 01:00:28,652
Just a minute. What?

705
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:30,352
Did he say 7 5,000?

706
01:00:30,426 --> 01:00:32,792
He said $7 5,000 a week.

707
01:00:32,862 --> 01:00:34,796
Wow, that's a lot of money.

708
01:00:35,665 --> 01:00:38,964
Susan thinks that $7 5,000 a week
is a lot of money.

709
01:00:39,035 --> 01:00:42,027
Well, $7 5,000 is a lot of money...

710
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:45,233
if I wanted to be
a television actor.

711
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:47,866
Yeah, thank you.

712
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:51,107
- Tell him that. Schmuck.
- What did he say?

713
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:53,114
What did he say, Matty?

714
01:00:54,183 --> 01:00:56,981
It's not really
any of your business.

715
01:00:57,053 --> 01:00:58,987
It's,just, you know--

716
01:00:59,055 --> 01:01:00,989
What do you mean ?

717
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:06,793
- It's none of my business?
- How much did this painting cost?

718
01:01:06,863 --> 01:01:09,024
- Why?
- Let's talk about this, not that.

719
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:12,431
Because this is your business,
and that is my business.

720
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,432
And you're talking
about my business?

721
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:17,265
What is this, a basin people used
to wash their faces in?

722
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:21,003
- I mean, who cares?
- Great. Yeah. Thanks.

723
01:01:23,713 --> 01:01:25,476
Come on.
What did he say?

724
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:30,844
He said to mind
your own fucking business.

725
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:35,050
- You have to go back to work sometime.
- I know I have to go back to work!

726
01:01:35,124 --> 01:01:38,059
I know that. I know that.

727
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:42,463
You don't think that I know that
I have to go back to work sometime?

728
01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:48,737
- Let's go.
- Don't be like this.

729
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:51,934
Like what? Stop treating me
like you're some prison warden.

730
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:54,704
I don't want to leave it
like this.

731
01:01:54,777 --> 01:01:57,769
I can take care of myself
for three days while you're gone.

732
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:16,998
You'll miss the plane.
You said it yourself.

733
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:23,266
Come on. You said 20 minutes.
You're gonna make her late.

734
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:25,864
Fuckin' dick-head.

735
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:28,536
Wait a minute.
Fuckin' son of a bitch.

736
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:30,541
Wait a minute.
Susan.

737
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:38,776
Bye.

738
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:23,932
This is fuckin' cool.

739
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:32,406
Go for it, baby.
Go for it.

740
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:35,876
You know what'd really be cool?
If you guys had some fans.

741
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:38,880
If you had some fans,
you could fan me.

742
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:44,317
Oh, shit. Oh, man.

743
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:56,196
What the fuck are you doing here?

744
01:03:56,265 --> 01:04:00,201
- You look great, man. You okay?
- Yeah, I feel great.

745
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:02,203
What are you backpedaling for?

746
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:05,638
I need to talk to you. I don't
want to talk in front of those--

747
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:11,470
I gotta see Annie.

748
01:04:11,547 --> 01:04:15,210
No, you don't have to see Annie.
Annie's living in Mexico City, man.

749
01:04:15,284 --> 01:04:18,219
She's got an old man. She's been
there a year. She's doing fine.

750
01:04:18,287 --> 01:04:23,247
Just go back to New York. You don't want
to be looking for trouble down here.

751
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:24,850
Just go home.

752
01:04:29,165 --> 01:04:32,134
I gotta see Annie.
I gotta make my peace.

753
01:04:32,168 --> 01:04:34,136
Just let it go, man.

754
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:37,162
I gotta see her.
I gotta talk to her.

755
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:40,073
That chick was kickin' the shit
out of you, brother.

756
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:44,044
I gotta make my amends. I can't get on
with my life until I seal this thing up.

757
01:04:44,113 --> 01:04:47,276
Oh, you fuckin' AA people
and your fuckin' amends.

758
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:51,309
-Just let the fuckin' thing go.
- No, I'm not gonna let it go!

759
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:55,050
Don't give me that AA shit.
You don't know what I've been through.

760
01:04:55,124 --> 01:04:58,116
I've been crying for two years.

761
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:00,651
My gut's coming out of my stomach.

762
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:06,329
We were together for five years,
and she just walked out of my life.

763
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:12,004
I'll make some calls.
I'm not promising you nothin'.

764
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:14,008
- Please, Mick.
- All right, all right.

765
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:15,407
I'll make some calls.

766
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:17,605
Take it easy down here.

767
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,614
You're looking great.

768
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:26,010
You look good straight, man.

769
01:05:35,364 --> 01:05:37,025
That's fuckin' really nice.

770
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:01,380
<i>You want something?</i>

771
01:06:07,229 --> 01:06:09,595
<i>I told you about Mickey, right?</i>

772
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,260
<i>The moment of awe.</i>
<i>The moment of awe.</i>

773
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:56,328
Yeah, baby.

774
01:08:44,587 --> 01:08:46,555
<i>She comes up to me...</i>

775
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:48,146
<i>and she--</i>

776
01:08:49,558 --> 01:08:51,549
<i>she knocks on the door...</i>

777
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:53,356
<i>and he's there.</i>

778
01:08:53,429 --> 01:08:56,455
<i>You want to marry me</i>
<i>because I was still pregnant?</i>

779
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:58,466
<i>Listen to me.</i>

780
01:09:00,169 --> 01:09:02,433
<i>Would you like to come in?</i>

781
01:09:07,943 --> 01:09:10,173
<i>Would you like to have a drink...</i>

782
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:13,909
<i>or would you just like to</i>
<i>give me a blow job right now?</i>

783
01:09:13,949 --> 01:09:17,476
<i>Did you want to marry me</i>
<i>because I was still pregnant?</i>

784
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:27,295
<i>Did you have an abortion?</i>

785
01:09:28,797 --> 01:09:30,230
<i>Did you?</i>

786
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:33,564
<i>I don't want my baby</i>
<i>to have a father who is a junkie.</i>

787
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:36,264
<i>You understand that?</i>

788
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:38,273
<i>Who's the junkie?</i>

789
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:40,275
<i>Who you talking about?</i>

790
01:09:43,245 --> 01:09:45,406
<i>- You told me--</i>
<i>- Did you have an abortion?</i>

791
01:09:46,482 --> 01:09:47,676
<i>Yes.</i>

792
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:50,685
<i>You told me to have an abortion.</i>
<i>It's yours</i>!

793
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:04,526
<i>What did it feel like? Huh?</i>
<i>What did it feel like?</i>

794
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:10,195
<i>What did it feel like</i>
<i>to have an abortion?</i>

795
01:10:10,272 --> 01:10:12,638
<i>Why would you fuckin'cut my--</i>

796
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:21,676
<i>That's it.</i>

797
01:11:21,744 --> 01:11:23,507
<i>That's it.</i>

798
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:26,275
<i>Go for it, Matty.</i>
<i>Oh,yeah.</i>

799
01:11:26,348 --> 01:11:27,906
<i>Go for it.</i>

800
01:11:27,983 --> 01:11:30,383
<i>That's pure, man.</i>

801
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:31,817
<i>That's pure.</i>

802
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:04,518
Hello, Rene, it's Matty.

803
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:08,078
Hey, listen, I'm sorry
to be calling you so late...

804
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:11,088
but did Annie--
did Annie go home to see--

805
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:12,487
Did Annie go home?

806
01:12:12,561 --> 01:12:16,998
Did she return to France?

807
01:12:17,032 --> 01:12:19,000
Did she go home?

808
01:12:21,103 --> 01:12:22,627
No, no, I don't.

809
01:12:22,705 --> 01:12:26,573
You see, I don't know where she is.
That's why I'm calling you.

810
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:29,577
I was hoping maybe you could
tell me where she was.

811
01:12:33,382 --> 01:12:35,850
<i>No, no, it's Matt.</i>
<i>How you doing, baby?</i>

812
01:12:35,884 --> 01:12:38,614
<i>Listen, I need to talk to Annie.</i>

813
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:40,882
<i>You haven't seen her, have you?</i>

814
01:12:40,956 --> 01:12:46,019
<i>I've been calling all over the place,</i>
<i>and I thought you would know.</i>

815
01:12:46,095 --> 01:12:47,494
<i>What?</i>

816
01:12:50,933 --> 01:12:53,458
<i>Forget the ''I-got-a-lot-of-nerve''shit.</i>
<i>Where is she?</i>

817
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:57,062
<i>Fuck you, man</i>! <i>You know who this is.</i>
<i>You shot the pictures for</i> Premiere.

818
01:12:57,139 --> 01:13:01,667
<i>You were the last person to see her.</i>
<i>Now, where the fuck is she? Huh?</i>

819
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:04,907
<i>No, fuck you,</i>
<i>you fucking cocksucker</i>!

820
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:10,043
<i>Tell me where she is, or I'm gonna come</i>
<i>over there and put my fist up your ass</i>!

821
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,595
Where are you?

822
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:32,799
Hi, baby-- Ow.

823
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:36,811
<i>What do you mean, ''Hi, baby''?</i>
<i>Where the hell are you?</i>

824
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,211
<i>Matty, where are you?</i>

825
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:43,748
<i>I come home, and there's nobody here,</i>
<i>not even a note.</i>

826
01:13:43,786 --> 01:13:45,651
<i>Where are you?</i>

827
01:13:45,721 --> 01:13:47,450
I am in Miami.

828
01:13:47,523 --> 01:13:51,152
In Miami? In Miami.
Have you been drinking?

829
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,829
<i>Have you been drinking?</i>

830
01:13:55,898 --> 01:13:57,957
<i>You've been drinking.</i>
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

831
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:04,470
<i>Don't lie to me.</i>
<i>Come on. Don't do this to me.</i>

832
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:06,030
I'm not lying.

833
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:08,838
Oh, God, you're so fucking drunk.

834
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:10,845
You're so fucking drunk.

835
01:14:11,814 --> 01:14:14,180
<i>Why'd you do that? Why?</i>

836
01:14:16,552 --> 01:14:18,747
<i>I'm pregnant.</i>

837
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:21,187
<i>What do you say to that?</i>

838
01:14:21,256 --> 01:14:23,190
I'm gonna come down. Okay?

839
01:14:23,258 --> 01:14:25,726
<i>No, I'm gonna come home tonight.</i>
<i>I'll be home.</i>

840
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:27,490
<i>The guy, the concierge...</i>

841
01:14:27,563 --> 01:14:31,055
he's making the reservations, so
there's no reason for you to come down.

842
01:14:31,099 --> 01:14:33,897
<i>Which plane are you taking?</i>

843
01:14:33,936 --> 01:14:37,463
I don't know.
The guy is making the reservations.

844
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:40,035
<i>Do you promise?</i>

845
01:14:40,108 --> 01:14:42,076
I promise. I promise.

846
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:43,702
Just--

847
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:46,077
Just be cool.
Just stay there.

848
01:14:46,114 --> 01:14:48,082
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

849
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:51,776
<i>- I love you.</i>
- I love you too.

850
01:14:53,555 --> 01:14:54,920
I really do.

851
01:16:50,706 --> 01:16:52,901
How are you?
Close the door.

852
01:16:52,975 --> 01:16:56,035
How the fuck are you?
Fuckin' nut.

853
01:16:56,111 --> 01:16:59,103
How you doin'?
When you gonna meet me later?

854
01:16:59,181 --> 01:17:01,672
I gotta get goin'.
People are beeping me all night.

855
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:05,117
- What do you got?
- What do I always got?

856
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:07,246
- You all right?
- Yeah, man.

857
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:14,060
- This ain't talcum powder, is it?
- It's all rocks. Give me the money.

858
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:15,721
You don't trust me?

859
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:17,856
Hey, I saw that movie you were in.

860
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:20,959
You played a cop and you fuckin'
killed all the coke addicts.

861
01:17:21,036 --> 01:17:24,062
- I couldn't fuckin' believe it.
- You want a drink?

862
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:27,870
No, I don't drink. I want you to show me
how you killed all those fuckin' guys.

863
01:17:28,944 --> 01:17:32,311
<i>- I believe that's where she's at.</i>
<i>- How would she have died?</i>

864
01:17:32,347 --> 01:17:35,145
<i>- That's one of my nightmares.</i>
<i>- What is the nightmare?</i>

865
01:17:35,183 --> 01:17:36,741
<i>That I'm responsible.</i>

866
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:39,651
<i>In what way are you responsible</i>
<i>in the dream?</i>

867
01:17:39,688 --> 01:17:42,657
<i>That I took my hands and...</i>

868
01:17:44,226 --> 01:17:45,454
<i>choked her.</i>

869
01:17:45,694 --> 01:17:47,821
I'll see you later. Okay?

870
01:17:47,896 --> 01:17:49,864
- You all right?
- Yeah. Thanks.

871
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:09,183
That's it.

872
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:14,014
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

873
01:18:15,057 --> 01:18:18,185
That's it. Wow.
That's pure, man.

874
01:18:19,227 --> 01:18:20,717
That's pure.

875
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:48,122
He's looking for me?

876
01:18:51,126 --> 01:18:53,060
He's fuckin' pathetic, man.

877
01:18:56,998 --> 01:18:58,363
She's here.

878
01:18:59,534 --> 01:19:02,469
I got her from Acapulco, man.
She's here.

879
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:10,209
You're alive.

880
01:19:25,894 --> 01:19:27,828
I missed you so much.

881
01:19:43,078 --> 01:19:45,012
Where you been, baby?

882
01:19:47,015 --> 01:19:48,949
Ayear and a half and...

883
01:19:51,052 --> 01:19:52,986
you never even called me.

884
01:19:56,324 --> 01:19:58,849
Don't you care about me, baby?

885
01:20:01,596 --> 01:20:04,087
You look like a piece of shit.

886
01:20:07,169 --> 01:20:11,105
I believed so much
you stopped drinking.

887
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:13,107
I'm not drinking. I just--

888
01:20:13,175 --> 01:20:14,574
Oh, I see.

889
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:16,607
I'm not drinking.
This was--

890
01:20:18,380 --> 01:20:19,574
Tell her, Mickey.

891
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:22,613
Tell her.
I was straight, man.

892
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:25,286
I was straight, man!

893
01:20:25,353 --> 01:20:28,584
The whole time I was gone,
I wasn't drinking!

894
01:20:28,623 --> 01:20:33,026
I was missing you,
and you fucking wouldn't come to me!

895
01:20:40,302 --> 01:20:42,293
I'll lose my time in Acapulco.

896
01:20:42,370 --> 01:20:45,305
Say something, man!
Say something!

897
01:20:45,373 --> 01:20:47,398
Hey, man,
we're getting out of here.

898
01:20:47,442 --> 01:20:50,036
I'm taking her to the airport.
Do whatever you want.

899
01:20:50,111 --> 01:20:55,014
- I don't want to lose my time.
- She's back. Back to Acapulco.

900
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:37,307
<i>I just lie down and I can look up</i>
<i>and see all the stars.</i>

901
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:41,045
<i>The roof opens?</i>

902
01:22:41,122 --> 01:22:44,057
<i>Well,you know, like a sunroof.</i>

903
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:49,062
<i>But it doesn't close, so when it rains</i>
<i>it's kinda shitty. You know?</i>

904
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:50,495
Where is it?

905
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:53,597
Sorry!

906
01:22:53,668 --> 01:22:55,295
Are you okay?

907
01:22:55,370 --> 01:22:56,962
Do I have goals?

908
01:22:57,038 --> 01:22:59,029
Do you?

909
01:22:59,107 --> 01:23:00,472
Right.

910
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:38,001
You want a kiss?

911
01:23:39,147 --> 01:23:41,081
- Oh, you're beautiful.
- Thank you.

912
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:43,777
I'm sure everybody tells you that.

913
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:46,078
Ooh, yeah. Got that spark.

914
01:23:46,154 --> 01:23:48,349
- You wanna smoke a joint?
- Sure.

915
01:23:48,423 --> 01:23:51,290
Cool. Let's go.
Right out that way.

916
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:53,020
Where are we going?

917
01:23:53,094 --> 01:23:56,291
How about candle wax?
You ever had candle wax dripped on you?

918
01:23:56,364 --> 01:24:00,562
That's pretty fuckin' harmless.
I never heard of anyone dying from that.

919
01:24:00,635 --> 01:24:03,502
- How's that?
- You'll scare the shit out of him.

920
01:24:03,538 --> 01:24:05,335
- Fuckin' terrific.
- Really?

921
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:07,500
It's fuckin' great.

922
01:24:07,575 --> 01:24:10,738
Annie. You look
just like Annie, baby.

923
01:24:10,812 --> 01:24:12,336
I am Annie.

924
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:15,611
No, no, you're Annie 2.
There's an Annie 1 .

925
01:24:15,683 --> 01:24:17,150
- Annie 1 ?
- Yeah.

926
01:24:17,218 --> 01:24:19,686
Do your lips like that.

927
01:24:19,754 --> 01:24:22,245
- No, not like that.
- Excuse me.

928
01:24:22,323 --> 01:24:24,757
Lick your lips casually.
Just casually.

929
01:24:24,826 --> 01:24:28,057
Look at my crotch and lick your lips.
Come on!

930
01:24:28,129 --> 01:24:30,757
You can do that.
I'm not touching you. Do it.

931
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:34,768
<i>Let's walk and talk.</i>
<i>Let's go blow his mind.</i>

932
01:24:34,836 --> 01:24:37,361
<i>- You ready?</i>
<i>- Okay, should I leave this--</i>

933
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:40,306
<i>Do you like him a lot?</i>
<i>Huh?</i>

934
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:43,310
<i>Maybe. I don't know.</i>
<i>I just met him.</i>

935
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:47,807
<i>Okay, go wow him, baby.</i>
<i>You go wow him.</i>

936
01:24:52,387 --> 01:24:54,355
<i>Knock him dead.</i>

937
01:25:13,808 --> 01:25:15,332
<i>Do you like it?</i>

938
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:22,147
<i>Wait a second, baby.</i>
<i>You don't need that.</i>

939
01:25:22,217 --> 01:25:24,242
<i>It's okay, it's okay.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

940
01:25:25,353 --> 01:25:27,446
<i>Go ahead.</i>

941
01:25:27,522 --> 01:25:30,457
<i>Be the little waitress</i>
<i>that you are, baby.</i>

942
01:25:34,829 --> 01:25:37,389
<i>Why did you leave me?</i>

943
01:25:37,465 --> 01:25:40,400
<i>- I was just in the next room.</i>
<i>- Why did you go?</i>

944
01:25:41,669 --> 01:25:43,193
<i>I'm right here.</i>

945
01:26:00,455 --> 01:26:03,424
<i>Hey. Hey, hey.</i>
<i>What's going on?</i>

946
01:26:11,933 --> 01:26:13,423
<i>Tell her, man.</i>

947
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:17,863
<i>You didn't have an abortion, right?</i>

948
01:26:17,939 --> 01:26:19,600
<i>It's not impor--</i>

949
01:26:19,674 --> 01:26:22,609
<i>Is this acting?</i>
<i>What are you doing? Matty.</i>

950
01:26:24,612 --> 01:26:27,206
<i>just go with it, baby.</i>
<i>just go with it.</i>

951
01:26:28,283 --> 01:26:29,841
<i>Tell her.</i>

952
01:26:29,918 --> 01:26:31,408
<i>Tell her, Matty.</i>

953
01:26:33,521 --> 01:26:35,751
<i>- Where's the baby?</i>
<i>- You're hurting me.</i>

954
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:38,281
<i>Where's the baby?</i>

955
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:40,589
<i>Stop it</i>! <i>Help</i>!

956
01:26:40,628 --> 01:26:42,789
<i>- I'm choking, Matty.</i>
<i>- Tell me.</i>

957
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:45,526
<i>Tell me</i>!

958
01:28:03,044 --> 01:28:05,979
Pretty emotional about that take, huh?

959
01:28:07,649 --> 01:28:10,015
Did you feel that one, did ya?

960
01:28:11,619 --> 01:28:13,678
Best fuckin' work you've ever done.

961
01:28:14,489 --> 01:28:17,424
It's too bad
you don't fuckin' remember it.

962
01:28:18,626 --> 01:28:21,561
Too bad you're
a fuckin' coked-up drunk.

963
01:28:21,629 --> 01:28:24,689
You don't fuckin' remember
your best performance.

964
01:28:26,668 --> 01:28:29,296
It's hard for me to fuckin' forget it.

965
01:28:30,405 --> 01:28:32,896
What kind of piece of shit are you?

966
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:35,602
What kind of piece of filth are you?

967
01:28:35,677 --> 01:28:38,475
You big fuckin' movie star.

968
01:28:38,513 --> 01:28:41,482
Come down and shit
all over my parade, brother.

969
01:28:41,516 --> 01:28:46,749
Shit on my little fuckin' parade,
you big, privileged fuckin' movie star.

970
01:28:46,821 --> 01:28:48,311
Huh?

971
01:28:48,956 --> 01:28:51,891
You killed that chick
that fuckin' night...

972
01:28:53,361 --> 01:28:55,329
and I watched you.

973
01:28:55,363 --> 01:28:58,491
And I don't wanna fuckin'
cop out on this...

974
01:28:58,566 --> 01:29:02,969
but I didn't know she was fuckin' dead
until I touched her fuckin' face.

975
01:29:03,037 --> 01:29:07,804
And you couldn't have known she was dead
'cause you were in a fuckin' blackout.

976
01:29:07,842 --> 01:29:10,936
I got rid of her.
I got rid of her.

977
01:29:15,516 --> 01:29:18,007
When are you gonna
fuckin' take responsibility?

978
01:29:18,086 --> 01:29:22,580
Look in the mirror at a fuckin' murderer
and grow up, motherfucker.

979
01:29:22,657 --> 01:29:26,149
Grow up real fuckin' quick,
'cause you ain't gonna live very long.

980
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:28,727
'Cause this is my life too...

981
01:29:28,796 --> 01:29:31,094
you piece of shit.

982
01:29:31,165 --> 01:29:34,100
Fuck you and the fuckin' horse
you rode in on.

983
01:29:34,168 --> 01:29:37,729
You get out of my fuckin' life.
You get out of my fuckin' life.

984
01:29:37,805 --> 01:29:40,797
Out of my fuckin' mind.
Out of my fuckin' memory.

985
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:43,173
Get outta here! Out!

986
01:29:43,411 --> 01:29:46,175
Out! Out! Out! Out!

987
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:50,983
Get outta here!

988
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:53,418
Fuckin' live with it, motherfucker!

989
01:29:53,488 --> 01:29:56,855
Live with it!
Grow up, you cocksucker!

990
01:29:57,892 --> 01:29:59,860
Learn to live with it!

991
01:30:00,928 --> 01:30:02,862
You piece of filth.

992
01:30:04,098 --> 01:30:05,622
Fuck you.

993
01:30:06,834 --> 01:30:08,199
Fuck you.

994
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:12,032
Fuck you!

995
01:30:30,725 --> 01:30:32,158
<i>I answered your question.</i>

996
01:30:32,226 --> 01:30:38,028
<i>As you look at your life, are you</i>
<i>satisfied with what and where you are?</i>

997
01:30:38,065 --> 01:30:40,590
<i>What do you want to be different?</i>

998
01:30:40,668 --> 01:30:44,661
<i>I wanna be free from my past.</i>

999
01:30:46,908 --> 01:30:49,877
<i>What comes to your mind?</i>
<i>What are your options?</i>

1000
01:31:08,596 --> 01:31:09,893
What are you doing?

1001
01:31:09,964 --> 01:31:12,558
I told you to stay in New York!

1002
01:31:12,633 --> 01:31:15,898
Get outta here!
I told you not to come here!

1003
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:17,494
Stop it!

1004
01:31:18,606 --> 01:31:20,574
I don't love you.

1005
01:31:23,945 --> 01:31:25,503
I don't love you.

1006
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:27,514
I don't love you.
Okay?

1007
01:31:29,717 --> 01:31:32,845
- Do you think you love me?
- I love you.

1008
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:36,185
You don't even know me.
You don't know anything about me!

1009
01:31:37,258 --> 01:31:39,726
Listen to me.
Listen.

1010
01:31:39,794 --> 01:31:41,159
Listen to me!

1011
01:31:44,131 --> 01:31:46,099
I'm a murderer.

1012
01:31:47,635 --> 01:31:49,569
I'm a murderer.

1013
01:31:51,239 --> 01:31:52,866
You hear me?

1014
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:56,034
I'm a murderer!
Do you hear me?

1015
01:31:56,110 --> 01:31:58,135
I killed somebody!

1016
01:31:59,514 --> 01:32:01,277
You think you love me?

1017
01:32:02,583 --> 01:32:04,915
I don't even love myself.

1018
01:32:04,986 --> 01:32:06,920
So how can you love me?

1019
01:32:06,988 --> 01:32:08,546
Do you understand?

1020
01:32:08,589 --> 01:32:12,719
I took a 1 7-year-old by the throat,
and I choked the life out of her.

1021
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:14,250
<i>Do you understand?</i>

1022
01:32:14,328 --> 01:32:16,922
<i>If you love me,</i>
<i>you'll let me go.</i>

1023
01:32:18,933 --> 01:32:20,298
Let me go.

1024
01:32:26,908 --> 01:32:29,274
Get outta here! Go home!

1025
01:32:38,986 --> 01:32:40,544
Don't do that!

1026
01:32:40,621 --> 01:32:41,713
Don't!

1027
01:34:57,892 --> 01:34:59,826
Did you miss me?
