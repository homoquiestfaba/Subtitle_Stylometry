- What's up, man?

16
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:19,829
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

17
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:20,670
Just bring the people. I'll dance, alright.

18
00:02:20,718 --> 00:02:22,677
- I need you on your A-game.
- Alright, I'll bring the show.

19
00:02:22,678 --> 00:02:25,889
- Hi.
- One second. Could we just... time out.

20
00:02:26,278 --> 00:02:28,195
- Just get a crowd on me, alright?
- Yes.

21
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:31,026
- Yo, Donny. First bus of the day.
- All right.

22
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:33,907
Ladies and gentlemen, please,

23
00:02:34,198 --> 00:02:35,323
please come this way.

24
00:02:35,558 --> 00:02:37,184
Step this way.

25
00:02:38,238 --> 00:02:41,156
Please come closer. I got something special
for y'all and his name is Donny Bray.

26
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:46,123
What he does with his feet has never been seen
on Bourbon Street.

27
00:02:46,518 --> 00:02:49,562
And he's going to show you the real N'Awlins.

28
00:02:49,718 --> 00:02:51,427
I think they're ready, let's go!

29
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:01,319
I taught him everything he knows!

30
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,080
Nice catch!

31
00:03:34,357 --> 00:03:35,232
Yeah. Come on, come on.

32
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:56,546
Thank you so much. Thank you so much.

33
00:03:57,877 --> 00:04:00,395
All right. All right let's go. Show's over!

34
00:04:00,396 --> 00:04:03,023
That's it. Show's over! Move it on. Let's go.

35
00:04:03,196 --> 00:04:03,988
Hey.

36
00:04:06,757 --> 00:04:08,383
What's wrong? What'd I do?

37
00:04:08,397 --> 00:04:10,516
You're not supposed to be
within a hundred feet of a bar

38
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:12,351
or hang around with the criminal element.

39
00:04:12,356 --> 00:04:14,649
That's a condition of your parole
and you know it.

40
00:04:14,836 --> 00:04:18,255
Oh, come on, man, this is New Orleans.
There's a bar every twenty feet.

41
00:04:18,477 --> 00:04:19,393
Ladies, please don't--

42
00:04:19,476 --> 00:04:20,810
Why are you hassling me?

43
00:04:20,996 --> 00:04:22,288
Because you don't listen.

44
00:04:22,317 --> 00:04:25,794
I told you when you got out you have to
have a job or you're in violation.

45
00:04:25,795 --> 00:04:28,255
Dancing is my job, okay. It's what I do.

46
00:04:28,316 --> 00:04:30,317
And how do I know that this is legit.

47
00:04:30,397 --> 00:04:32,635
You got a work slip?
You got a W-2 you can show me?

48
00:04:32,636 --> 00:04:35,472
This is bullshit. You want me back in jail.

49
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:37,627
You're not as dumb as you look.

50
00:04:38,636 --> 00:04:42,474
You know, kid, you answer to me
for the next six months.

51
00:04:42,477 --> 00:04:44,811
And I'm telling you now,
you're done with this.

52
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:48,335
You got it... or do we have a problem?

53
00:04:50,675 --> 00:04:51,633
No problem.

54
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:54,249
Good. Let's move it.

55
00:05:00,195 --> 00:05:03,954
Do we have a problem? Give me a break.

56
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:06,540
That PO keeps busting my chops,
I'm going to have a swing at him one day.

57
00:05:25,115 --> 00:05:26,615
This place looks hot.

58
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:27,952
What, Static?

59
00:05:28,234 --> 00:05:32,112
Yeah, it is hot, man.
Number one underground club in New York.

60
00:05:32,555 --> 00:05:35,057
You know, my brother started
that place with his partner, Kaz.

61
00:05:36,274 --> 00:05:37,233
That's him.

62
00:05:38,514 --> 00:05:40,807
Right. I see the family resemblance.

63
00:05:41,115 --> 00:05:43,408
We're foster brothers, obviously.

64
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,434
You know, they're hiring dancers
up there at the moment.

65
00:05:47,435 --> 00:05:49,770
- Is that right?
- Yeah. Paying pretty good, too.

66
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:02,834
What are you doing?

67
00:06:03,394 --> 00:06:06,472
They're not going to let me dance here, hell,
I'm going to Brooklyn.

68
00:06:06,474 --> 00:06:07,975
You have six more months of parole.

69
00:06:07,995 --> 00:06:10,913
You can't leave the State.
Hell, you can't even get in a club.

70
00:06:10,914 --> 00:06:12,581
Don't worry. I got a plan.

71
00:06:13,514 --> 00:06:15,932
Listen, if my parole officer calls,

72
00:06:16,154 --> 00:06:18,952
just tell him I'm working the pipeline
between Shreveport and Baton Rouge,

73
00:06:18,954 --> 00:06:19,662
okay?

74
00:06:19,674 --> 00:06:20,590
Are you nuts?

75
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,132
Just make sure you call me.
I'll call him right back.

76
00:06:23,154 --> 00:06:24,779
I'll fly back in for my check-ins.

77
00:06:24,874 --> 00:06:28,592
In fact, I'll be making so much money dancing
for Nick, I'll fly back first class.

78
00:06:28,593 --> 00:06:29,801
This is crazy.

79
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:32,794
If your foster, bro, finds out
you skipped parole, he's sending you back.

80
00:06:33,514 --> 00:06:34,931
Well, he doesn't need to know that, does he?

81
00:06:44,634 --> 00:06:45,676
Hey. Yo, D, have a good time.

82
00:06:45,714 --> 00:06:47,298
Alright, man. I'll see you guys later.

83
00:06:47,313 --> 00:06:49,898
- Hey, you still owe me fifty bucks.
- Cheque's in the mail.

84
00:06:56,753 --> 00:07:03,431
Brooklyn nobody nobody
No, nobody does it like Brooklyn

85
00:07:03,433 --> 00:07:08,437
Something's going off on the outer edge of
exciting exciting Brooklyn

86
00:07:08,793 --> 00:07:13,838
Nobody nobody
No, nobody does it like Brooklyn

87
00:07:14,113 --> 00:07:17,471
Something's going off on the outer edge of
exciting

88
00:07:17,473 --> 00:07:23,751
...it's a city by itself. BK home of the
best if nothing else. Her influence is felt

89
00:07:23,753 --> 00:07:26,591
Thoughts have gone global. Once was all local.

90
00:07:26,592 --> 00:07:28,951
Young Street hustle has crossed
the young motto... the young...

91
00:07:28,953 --> 00:07:35,458
Nobody nobody
No, nobody does it like Brooklyn

92
00:07:35,513 --> 00:07:38,974
Something's going off on the outer edge...

93
00:07:40,592 --> 00:07:41,592
So I asked,

94
00:07:41,873 --> 00:07:43,831
knelt right there by the pews and said,

95
00:07:43,832 --> 00:07:47,790
"Girl, do you need a prayer?
'Cause I would definitely put hands on you."

96
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:49,951
Nick, you said that to her in church?

97
00:07:49,952 --> 00:07:52,370
Choir practice, Sixth Grade.
Her name was Tiffany.

98
00:07:52,631 --> 00:07:55,174
We gave the Book of Psalms a remix.

99
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:58,602
Wow. I don't know how you do it, man.
You know my lines always come out wrong.

100
00:07:58,672 --> 00:08:01,215
Cause you got to commit to it.
You got to own it.

101
00:08:02,471 --> 00:08:04,550
- What's your best line?
- Man, I ain't giving you shit.

102
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:07,386
- Come on, man, what's your best line?
- My best line?

103
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:11,550
All right, my best line.
Science Class, Tenth Grade.

104
00:08:11,552 --> 00:08:13,345
I looked at this chick and I said,

105
00:08:13,352 --> 00:08:17,021
"Baby, your lab bench or mine?"

106
00:08:18,872 --> 00:08:20,622
- Really? Man,
- I knew it.

107
00:08:20,631 --> 00:08:23,800
- That's your best line?
- Come on, man.

108
00:08:24,232 --> 00:08:26,630
How long has it been anyway
since you last seen your little bro?

109
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,717
Two years, man. Two years too long.

110
00:08:29,992 --> 00:08:32,493
Me and him used to get into some shit.

111
00:08:33,191 --> 00:08:34,191
Yeah, Nick here.

112
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:36,808
What do you mean they're back?

113
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,727
I'm close. No, I'm close, I'll handle it.

114
00:08:39,871 --> 00:08:41,079
I said I'll handle it.

115
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,104
Who is it?

116
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:43,466
Guess?

117
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,582
Sorry.

118
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,672
That's okay.

119
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,320
Shuffle heel toe. Toe heel step.
Shuffle heel toe.

120
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,347
Yeah.

121
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,245
Keep it going!

122
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,742
- You okay?
- Yeah.

123
00:10:08,229 --> 00:10:10,063
I told you to stay out of my neighbourhood.

124
00:10:10,349 --> 00:10:12,347
Consider us your eviction notice.

125
00:10:12,349 --> 00:10:14,100
No! What are you doing?

126
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,243
Whoa! Easy there, Hello Kitty.

127
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:18,473
Does it look like I'm into all
that "Crouching Tiger"?

128
00:10:18,669 --> 00:10:19,711
You're disgusting.

129
00:10:20,189 --> 00:10:21,773
Yeah. Well, you just get your ass out of here.

130
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:24,490
Tell your brother
I won't be so easy on you next time.

131
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:37,713
- You okay?
- Yeah.

132
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:53,826
Who dat?!

133
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:57,440
- Hey, Nick, what's up?
- What's up, dude.

134
00:10:57,508 --> 00:10:59,884
- What's this on your face?
- You got peach fuzz now? Shut up, man.

135
00:11:00,028 --> 00:11:01,737
Oh look at you, Dukes of Hazzard,
where'd you get this?

136
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:05,125
Oh, you got jokes. I got it where I got it.

137
00:11:05,588 --> 00:11:08,757
- Thought you finished puberty.
- You got jokes.

138
00:11:09,148 --> 00:11:10,065
Why were you so late?

139
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,422
- I had some business to handle.
- Yeah, business?

140
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:16,626
Yeah. Glad you finally called, baby brother.

141
00:11:17,148 --> 00:11:18,565
Well, you know, I been kind of busy.

142
00:11:18,669 --> 00:11:20,878
How's it feel to be back in the free world?

143
00:11:21,268 --> 00:11:23,102
Man, I'm not going through all that ever again.

144
00:11:23,387 --> 00:11:25,639
Had this parole officer on my case once a week.

145
00:11:25,988 --> 00:11:28,990
Couldn't step foot in a club, a bar.
And I couldn't do anything.

146
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:30,971
No, I'm not going back to that.

147
00:11:31,188 --> 00:11:34,316
So you're a law-abiding citizen now?
Good for you.

148
00:11:35,507 --> 00:11:38,551
I always knew you were tone deaf.
I didn't say that.

149
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,705
...playing with the monsters in the mind

150
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:51,836
Now hold it up... hold it up...

151
00:12:01,307 --> 00:12:03,016
Long ways out, don't you think?

152
00:12:03,948 --> 00:12:05,365
Keeps its mystery that way.

153
00:12:06,306 --> 00:12:10,768
One-way street out there.
Yeah, you mean it avoids regular cop patrols.

154
00:12:11,307 --> 00:12:12,849
Knew you'd fit right in.

155
00:12:15,427 --> 00:12:16,385
Welcome to Static.

156
00:12:16,507 --> 00:12:18,705
Standing room only five nights a week.

157
00:12:18,707 --> 00:12:19,457
Nice.

158
00:12:19,547 --> 00:12:21,172
- Yo, Nick, did you get your brother?
- Yes, sir.

159
00:12:21,227 --> 00:12:24,145
- D, Raphael.
- Hey, man.

160
00:12:25,186 --> 00:12:27,771
- Don't even.
- I didn't say anything

161
00:12:28,027 --> 00:12:31,529
This place used to be a factory.
They built ship motors, you believe that?

162
00:12:31,747 --> 00:12:34,665
Immigration buckled down,
sent the illegals packing.

163
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:38,824
The company that hired them didn't want to
pay real wages so they went Chapter Eleven.

164
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:39,701
And you stepped in.

165
00:12:39,746 --> 00:12:43,416
We are the D.I.Y generation, bro.
Come on, my place is around back.

166
00:12:45,946 --> 00:12:47,989
- I've finished all the invoices.
- Great.

167
00:12:48,706 --> 00:12:51,625
- And you must be Donny. I'm Tatianna.
- Oh hi.

168
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:53,626
Yeah, I've seen your body
painting dance online.

169
00:12:53,666 --> 00:12:54,624
It's cool. I like it.

170
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:56,125
She keeps our I.T. straight.

171
00:12:56,427 --> 00:12:58,386
And his ass out of trouble.

172
00:12:59,106 --> 00:13:01,464
You're going to keep pushing
until something pops off.

173
00:13:01,465 --> 00:13:02,465
"Pops off"?

174
00:13:02,705 --> 00:13:04,164
I'm not the one who started it.

175
00:13:04,426 --> 00:13:05,968
Well, then be the man and end it.

176
00:13:06,105 --> 00:13:07,939
Come on, little brother, I'll show you around.

177
00:13:09,866 --> 00:13:11,408
And you grew up with this guy?

178
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:13,491
Yeah, since I was six.

179
00:13:16,225 --> 00:13:18,352
This is the room that Kaz used to stay in.

180
00:13:18,745 --> 00:13:21,121
Right here is where we first dreamt up Static.

181
00:13:21,546 --> 00:13:22,754
So when will I meet him?

182
00:13:23,626 --> 00:13:24,792
That ain't going to happen.

183
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,722
What? I thought you guys were partners?

184
00:13:26,905 --> 00:13:30,699
Were. You wouldn't believe the stuff
that's gone down, man.

185
00:13:30,906 --> 00:13:34,224
- So what happened?
- There was this guy, Michael Griffith.

186
00:13:34,225 --> 00:13:38,061
He made millions on Wall Street swapping bonds
when everybody else was in the toilet.

187
00:13:38,064 --> 00:13:41,023
Sleazy bastard would roll through the club
three times a week with his clients.

188
00:13:41,025 --> 00:13:42,317
He'd buy out VIP.

189
00:13:42,345 --> 00:13:46,056
Just dumb all the way around.
And then she walked in.

190
00:13:46,505 --> 00:13:48,756
Aya, Kaz's sister.

191
00:13:49,185 --> 00:13:51,562
We let her and her crew perform at the club.

192
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,832
Michael became obsessed with her.

193
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:56,900
Kept hitting on her like
she was the sweetest deal in town.

194
00:13:57,825 --> 00:13:58,825
She's beautiful.

195
00:13:59,024 --> 00:14:00,316
Yeah, she all right.

196
00:14:00,944 --> 00:14:03,613
Kaz painted it. Matter of fact,
he painted all of this.

197
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:09,515
Anyway, Aya wouldn't give Michael
the time of day.

198
00:14:09,585 --> 00:14:12,584
Michael whispers to Kaz
that I'm screwing him over.

199
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,743
Says he'll set him up in a new club.

200
00:14:14,744 --> 00:14:16,661
Promises that his sister can dance there.

201
00:14:16,665 --> 00:14:17,915
New club?

202
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:19,523
Now they're our competition.

203
00:14:20,465 --> 00:14:22,091
Really walked into it here, huh?

204
00:14:24,024 --> 00:14:25,108
You'll catch up.

205
00:14:26,344 --> 00:14:28,345
Say, man, make yourself at home.

206
00:14:29,384 --> 00:14:32,136
Hey, I'm glad you're here.

207
00:14:43,705 --> 00:14:45,663
Are you okay? You weren't hurt?

208
00:14:45,664 --> 00:14:47,207
- We're fine.
- You sure?

209
00:14:47,224 --> 00:14:48,015
Yeah.

210
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:51,183
- And where's Natsumi?
- I'm in here.

211
00:14:51,303 --> 00:14:54,555
Not you. No guns in my house.

212
00:14:54,863 --> 00:14:55,738
Wait--

213
00:15:01,983 --> 00:15:05,694
I told you guys not to go there.
If you want to rehearse, use Oto.

214
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,862
- I'm on a deadline.
- For what?

215
00:15:07,864 --> 00:15:08,698
For work.

216
00:15:08,744 --> 00:15:11,204
We're meeting a woman later this week.
She's a producer.

217
00:15:11,224 --> 00:15:13,182
- Who this time?
- With Rocketeer.

218
00:15:13,183 --> 00:15:14,933
- She's real.
- So was the last one.

219
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:17,582
And so is the banks,
asking for their credit cards back.

220
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,793
Now I got to buy you guys a new set of drums.

221
00:15:20,104 --> 00:15:22,481
I'll take care of my own problems.

222
00:15:31,423 --> 00:15:33,861
- Michael would invest in your show.
- Please.

223
00:15:33,863 --> 00:15:37,462
He works Wall Street. And that road connects
everywhere, including I.N.S.

224
00:15:37,463 --> 00:15:40,882
This producer could sponsor me.
I don't need Michael.

225
00:15:40,942 --> 00:15:43,193
If they sign, produce and sponsor you. Okay?

226
00:15:43,382 --> 00:15:45,258
Your visa's up in three weeks.

227
00:15:45,263 --> 00:15:46,972
Then you could say, "Good luck".

228
00:15:47,023 --> 00:15:48,732
They're going to send you back to Japan.

229
00:15:48,862 --> 00:15:52,198
Do you have any idea
how hard I worked to get you here?

230
00:15:52,422 --> 00:15:54,673
It took me three years
just to get you on a plane.

231
00:15:54,822 --> 00:15:56,197
I am doing this for us.

232
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:58,516
And I want us to do it the right way.

233
00:15:59,503 --> 00:16:01,587
I need the bathroom!

234
00:16:02,742 --> 00:16:03,617
Toilet!

235
00:16:10,663 --> 00:16:13,141
Hope you don't need your bowl returned.
He will use it.

236
00:16:13,142 --> 00:16:15,602
It's okay. Michael gave it to me.

237
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:20,062
It's your rent.

238
00:16:24,462 --> 00:16:26,046
Will you talk to her for me? Sure.

239
00:16:26,702 --> 00:16:28,160
Are you serious?

240
00:16:32,662 --> 00:16:34,955
It's Gina. She wants to know the plan.

241
00:16:35,382 --> 00:16:38,551
Tell her to get dressed.
We're going to do a show.

242
00:16:43,662 --> 00:16:45,246
Everybody everybody

243
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:56,664
Hold up right there.

244
00:16:58,582 --> 00:17:01,250
Roscoe's spinning tonight.
We're gonna have a full house.

245
00:17:01,301 --> 00:17:03,844
All right. You don't have to
worry about patrols.

246
00:17:04,341 --> 00:17:05,591
Knew I could count on you.

247
00:17:05,621 --> 00:17:07,789
- This is B. New York's finest.
- Hey, man.

248
00:17:07,941 --> 00:17:10,234
This is Donny.
Newbie's going to be helping me out.

249
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:11,333
Cool.

250
00:17:12,621 --> 00:17:17,333
You see, he'll warn us if the ABCs are
sniffing for a spot without a liquor license.

251
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,578
- So what am I going to be doing here, anyway?
- Learning.

252
00:17:21,581 --> 00:17:25,579
Tend bar, work street promotions,
do some inventory. Follow me for a year or so.

253
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:29,259
- A year?
- You always want things yesterday. Give it time

254
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,858
We're going to open up clubs in Manhattan,
Queens, maybe one with your name on it.

255
00:17:32,861 --> 00:17:34,403
What you want me to put one
of those little belts on,

256
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:36,130
walk around selling Jager shots, too?

257
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:37,598
Hey, you're the one that called me, remember?

258
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,288
Alright, so give me something real to do, then.
Come on.

259
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,579
It's complicated, man. You don't just dive in.

260
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,578
Nobody will respect you, you got to earn it.

261
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:44,871
We're live at Static

262
00:17:44,901 --> 00:17:46,259
where a dozen New York artists

263
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,859
will be auctioning their works to buy
instruments and art supplies for city schools.

264
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,361
Put a smile on your face, would you.

265
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,218
Hey. How's my favourite blogger?

266
00:17:54,219 --> 00:17:55,678
- Good to see you.
- You too.

267
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,178
As always we are so happy
to give back here at Club Static.

268
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,850
I mean, at the end of the day it's all about
collaborating with as many people as I can.

269
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,098
Y'all make sure you come on out and support.
Much love.

270
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:07,683
All right, you heard it from the man himself.

271
00:18:07,699 --> 00:18:10,117
Now get down here to Static and support.

272
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,819
It's always like this.
You never give me a chance.

273
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,654
Nobody gave me shit.

274
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,458
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Wall Street.

275
00:18:28,459 --> 00:18:32,298
I don't care what they say, you boys deserve
those bonuses, you hear me?

276
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:35,259
Yes, sir, we do. Cheers.

277
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,939
- And maybe she'll be your next bond.
- Maybe.

278
00:18:58,699 --> 00:19:00,200
You know what that is.

279
00:19:00,219 --> 00:19:03,763
Check your watches and lace your sneaks.
It's Showtime.

280
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,478
Give it up for the KINGS & QUEENS.

281
00:19:42,258 --> 00:19:43,132
Cut it. Aya... Shh!

282
00:20:25,337 --> 00:20:26,921
I bet I could so some of that.

283
00:20:28,057 --> 00:20:30,536
It's a long way from dancing
on a New Orleans street corner, man.

284
00:20:30,537 --> 00:20:31,453
But I could.

285
00:20:31,816 --> 00:20:34,095
I could do something different, you know,
bring something new to your place.

286
00:20:34,097 --> 00:20:35,555
What, you criticizing my shit now?

287
00:20:35,578 --> 00:20:36,911
No, no, I didn't say that.

288
00:20:36,937 --> 00:20:39,456
I worked way too hard for you
to mess things up.

289
00:20:39,457 --> 00:20:41,833
- Whatever.
- No, it's not whatever, it's what is.

290
00:20:47,617 --> 00:20:48,909
I'm going to get a closer look.

291
00:20:51,457 --> 00:20:52,916
Just stay off my stage.

292
00:23:28,494 --> 00:23:31,538
Move, man, move! Get out of the way.

293
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:34,788
Hey! Move! Back it up!

294
00:23:37,054 --> 00:23:38,721
What's this!? Who is this!?

295
00:23:40,174 --> 00:23:41,299
Come on. Let's not get into it.

296
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:42,625
We own this...

297
00:23:54,253 --> 00:23:56,463
Alright, yeah.

298
00:23:57,532 --> 00:24:01,994
Oh my gosh! Taiko is back in the house!

299
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:25,631
Hey, hey. You need to play me.
You need to play me

300
00:24:30,533 --> 00:24:32,534
How the hell did they get in here,

301
00:24:32,732 --> 00:24:33,940
huh?! I don't know!

302
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:35,856
You're fired.

303
00:24:37,412 --> 00:24:39,539
Yeah! Let's get it on

304
00:24:57,491 --> 00:25:00,410
Oh! This club's about to go off

305
00:25:16,771 --> 00:25:19,970
Back up in the club makin'
all the speakers blow.

306
00:25:19,971 --> 00:25:23,610
It's your turn to act a fool so
push the throttle. Let it go.

307
00:25:23,612 --> 00:25:27,609
Ladies' hips rockin'.
Boys droppin' when we rock (roll)

308
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,194
Keep the crowd turned up

309
00:25:29,212 --> 00:25:31,296
We're out of control

310
00:25:37,251 --> 00:25:38,251
What are you doing?!

311
00:26:00,011 --> 00:26:03,388
Ladies and gents,
how many clubs do you see this in?

312
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:07,728
People! People! What is going on?
Make some noise!

313
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,105
Aya!

314
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,250
- Give me some tape.
- What?

315
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:11,874
- Give me some tape.
- Hang on.

316
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:14,482
Here you go.

317
00:26:24,771 --> 00:26:26,938
That's some serious execution!

318
00:26:27,569 --> 00:26:28,569
Out of the way!

319
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:32,598
What?

320
00:26:40,689 --> 00:26:43,608
Whoa, has she met her match,
ladies and gentlemen!

321
00:26:43,849 --> 00:26:44,683
All right.

322
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:52,177
Ah, we got a battle on our hands.

323
00:26:56,209 --> 00:26:59,378
You ready to get this place
open old-school style?

324
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:08,226
Let me see your hands up!

325
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:14,604
You okay?

326
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:17,360
No. Whoa! Oof.

327
00:27:42,209 --> 00:27:43,042
- Again?
- Hey!

328
00:27:54,128 --> 00:27:55,086
Hey,

329
00:27:56,688 --> 00:27:57,730
get the hell out of here.

330
00:27:58,128 --> 00:27:59,253
What do you think you're doing?

331
00:28:13,048 --> 00:28:15,341
- Give me that beer.
- Yo! Behind you.

332
00:28:19,808 --> 00:28:20,557
Alright.

333
00:28:31,688 --> 00:28:33,105
Hey, Nick, we got a hiccup.

334
00:28:34,327 --> 00:28:35,327
Put it away.

335
00:28:43,808 --> 00:28:46,309
- What's up, Nick?
- Why don't you get out?

336
00:28:46,927 --> 00:28:48,886
What you looking at? Take her with you.

337
00:28:49,008 --> 00:28:50,884
All I want is the drums you stole.

338
00:28:50,887 --> 00:28:53,222
I told you to stay away from my sister.

339
00:28:53,247 --> 00:28:54,831
I can handle this.

340
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:58,610
Show our guests out. No need to be gentle.

341
00:28:58,687 --> 00:29:01,022
I give this hole in the wall two weeks.

342
00:29:01,248 --> 00:29:01,997
Let's go.

343
00:29:02,047 --> 00:29:04,507
- No. Let me go!
- Hey! You're hurting her, man, come on.

344
00:29:08,007 --> 00:29:08,966
Hey! You crazy, man?

345
00:29:10,726 --> 00:29:11,935
Kaz, we'll kill you!

346
00:29:14,047 --> 00:29:14,880
Let's go!

347
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:16,762
Aya!

348
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:22,410
Hey, Nick, you all right?

349
00:29:28,527 --> 00:29:29,276
Hey!

350
00:29:31,086 --> 00:29:32,003
Aya!

351
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,273
Come on.

352
00:29:35,526 --> 00:29:36,234
What?

353
00:29:39,406 --> 00:29:40,615
Go! Go! Go!

354
00:29:47,166 --> 00:29:48,207
All right. We made it.

355
00:29:50,646 --> 00:29:52,647
- Who are you?
- What?

356
00:29:53,606 --> 00:29:57,233
Who are you? You jump up on the bar,
put cans on your feet.

357
00:29:57,246 --> 00:29:59,497
- Who does that?
- You were up there too.

358
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:00,964
Where to?

359
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:04,177
Ten blocks at the subway.

360
00:30:07,965 --> 00:30:09,883
Okay. Yeah. It's a tight squeeze
back here, man, don't you think?

361
00:30:09,886 --> 00:30:13,514
File a complaint. I am a courier, too.
I have many jobs.

362
00:30:15,806 --> 00:30:17,348
It is New York.

363
00:30:21,365 --> 00:30:22,824
Are you okay?

364
00:30:27,605 --> 00:30:28,813
He hit you.

365
00:30:30,165 --> 00:30:33,793
Been popped harder. I'm Donny.

366
00:30:35,645 --> 00:30:36,604
Aya.

367
00:30:38,765 --> 00:30:39,807
Yeah, I know.

368
00:30:43,604 --> 00:30:44,938
How do you know Nick?

369
00:30:45,285 --> 00:30:47,620
He's my brother.

370
00:30:48,285 --> 00:30:49,786
- Your brother?
- Yeah.

371
00:30:49,805 --> 00:30:52,844
Well, our mums used to work together,
mine split.

372
00:30:52,845 --> 00:30:55,013
So Nick and his mum took me in
when I was just a kid.

373
00:30:55,644 --> 00:30:57,312
So he's my brother.

374
00:30:58,725 --> 00:30:59,975
This is crazy.

375
00:31:00,084 --> 00:31:02,243
It was kind of crazy
but we kind of got used to it.

376
00:31:02,245 --> 00:31:04,747
No, no, no, no. You saw what happened.

377
00:31:05,444 --> 00:31:07,153
Nick and Kaz were ready to kill each other.

378
00:31:07,164 --> 00:31:09,165
Whoa, listen, I just got in today.

379
00:31:09,404 --> 00:31:10,738
I'm not in all that back there.

380
00:31:12,044 --> 00:31:13,169
You're in it now.

381
00:31:14,805 --> 00:31:15,805
What the--?

382
00:31:19,523 --> 00:31:21,733
Stop! Don't.

383
00:31:21,804 --> 00:31:23,054
Well how can I find you?

384
00:31:23,084 --> 00:31:24,209
Give me your phone.

385
00:31:24,645 --> 00:31:25,562
Aya!

386
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:28,636
Come on!

387
00:31:28,764 --> 00:31:30,181
I didn't even know my phone could do that.

388
00:31:30,203 --> 00:31:31,078
Go.

389
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:32,598
Let's go!

390
00:31:33,163 --> 00:31:35,915
Are you fucking crazy?
Someone could have been killed.

391
00:31:37,324 --> 00:31:38,575
No, stop it!

392
00:31:42,163 --> 00:31:44,164
We can keep this up right here, if you want.

393
00:31:45,883 --> 00:31:49,177
Either shoot somebody or pay me.
My meter's running.

394
00:31:50,724 --> 00:31:51,849
Get in the car now. Get in the car!

395
00:31:55,004 --> 00:31:55,962
Get in the car.

396
00:32:04,724 --> 00:32:06,224
What kind of stunt was that, huh?

397
00:32:06,243 --> 00:32:08,828
What are you doing?
Someone could have been hurt.

398
00:32:17,563 --> 00:32:18,355
See?

399
00:32:18,483 --> 00:32:21,694
This is exactly what I warned you about.
You don't know shit!

400
00:32:21,842 --> 00:32:24,520
You been here one day-- He's been here one day
and look at the mess you've caused.

401
00:32:24,522 --> 00:32:27,082
Listen, I have nothing to do with whatever's
between you and her brother.

402
00:32:27,084 --> 00:32:29,001
I told you to stay off my stage, didn't I?

403
00:32:29,243 --> 00:32:32,162
- I was on the bar.
- Yeah, I'm going to hire a babysitter next time

404
00:32:32,163 --> 00:32:33,413
Now get your ass in the car.

405
00:32:34,042 --> 00:32:35,250
Yo, let's roll.

406
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:37,722
Forget this.

407
00:32:38,643 --> 00:32:40,060
Man you don't even know where you're going.

408
00:32:44,282 --> 00:32:45,741
Yo, Nick, you want me to go and get him?

409
00:32:46,242 --> 00:32:50,370
No. Let him dance with a hat
on the ground for a few days.

410
00:33:41,642 --> 00:33:43,685
You reached Nick, you know what to do.

411
00:33:45,161 --> 00:33:49,998
Hey, man, it's Donny.
Just give me a call back when you can.

412
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:16,038
We goin' light up this city

413
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:17,960
Ooh, if you're rolling with your crew,

414
00:34:17,961 --> 00:34:22,438
I pity, pity the fool who,
Who don't rep for this city

415
00:34:22,439 --> 00:34:24,274
Ooh, if you got some drank in you,

416
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,638
I pity, pity the fool who,
Who don't rep for this city.

417
00:34:28,641 --> 00:34:32,039
We goin' light up this city

418
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,078
Ooh, if you're rolling with your crew,
I pity, pity the fool who,

419
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:36,079
Wish us luck.

420
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:41,541
Who don't rep for this city
We goin' light up this city

421
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,872
We put this together for you.

422
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,511
Thank you.

423
00:34:51,441 --> 00:34:54,610
- How many girls do you use again?
- Six, counting me.

424
00:34:56,759 --> 00:34:58,635
Oh, this next one has a softer vibe.

425
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,764
That's better.

426
00:35:02,561 --> 00:35:03,936
So when are you performing next?

427
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:08,851
We don't really have a spot right now.

428
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:12,366
But I need to see you live,
in front of a crowd.

429
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:16,852
The audience goes crazy when they see us.
It happened the other night.

430
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,335
But I wasn't there.

431
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,643
Camille. Your two-thirty's here.

432
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:26,517
Look, we produce live acts.
We find you names to tour with or open for.

433
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,079
We connect you with investors
to fund off-Broadway runs.

434
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,999
But we need to know if there's an audience
for anything we back.

435
00:35:34,318 --> 00:35:35,277
Good luck.

436
00:35:52,879 --> 00:35:54,630
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

437
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,677
I'm not your ordinary chick with the radio song

438
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:31,037
I'm not saying I ain't cute
but don't get me wrong

439
00:36:31,038 --> 00:36:33,397
I'm making... making... when you put it on

440
00:36:33,398 --> 00:36:35,357
All the way to the... Club

441
00:36:35,637 --> 00:36:40,155
Don't be confused when you see me
I don't want to be compared to nobody

442
00:36:40,158 --> 00:36:42,397
If you want me to start to raise you up

443
00:36:42,398 --> 00:36:44,983
Crank it up a little higher
'til you feel good...

444
00:36:56,278 --> 00:36:59,796
Admit it. You were only there
last night to show Nick up.

445
00:36:59,797 --> 00:37:03,091
- You hate losing as much as I do.
- I didn't lose.

446
00:37:03,918 --> 00:37:05,919
You did give him your number...

447
00:37:16,118 --> 00:37:16,868
Michael.

448
00:37:17,717 --> 00:37:18,843
Eh, "Kon-ban-wa."

449
00:37:19,878 --> 00:37:21,996
He's even learning Japanese to impress you.

450
00:37:21,997 --> 00:37:25,041
I understood some of that.
My impressive Japanese, right?

451
00:37:25,436 --> 00:37:29,314
Natsumi. Hi. Aya, how are you?

452
00:37:29,478 --> 00:37:30,686
Good, thank you.

453
00:37:40,878 --> 00:37:45,673
Let's hear it one more time for Blueprint Cru!

454
00:37:51,157 --> 00:37:52,782
New system sounds great.

455
00:37:52,957 --> 00:37:55,209
A little too much bass, if you ask me.

456
00:37:56,877 --> 00:37:58,252
Here we go with the Korean again.

457
00:37:58,396 --> 00:38:00,355
Maybe he didn't want you to understand.

458
00:38:00,876 --> 00:38:02,168
So come on, let's do this.

459
00:38:02,677 --> 00:38:05,428
Sunday night, you and your girls
finally perform here.

460
00:38:05,436 --> 00:38:07,062
You can go on as late as midnight.

461
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,202
We can invite Camille.

462
00:38:08,796 --> 00:38:09,629
Camille?

463
00:38:09,676 --> 00:38:11,259
This producer that's interested in us.

464
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:12,105
Really?

465
00:38:12,116 --> 00:38:14,909
She just needs to see us live
in front of a crowd.

466
00:38:14,996 --> 00:38:17,205
I see, so you want to use my place
for your audition?

467
00:38:17,277 --> 00:38:19,987
Your and my brother's place, you mean.

468
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:22,508
Yeah, I don't think it's
going to work like that.

469
00:38:23,356 --> 00:38:27,442
See, if you perform here, it's exclusive,
nowhere else.

470
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:30,768
Look, it's just business, okay?

471
00:38:30,956 --> 00:38:33,115
I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what,
I'm a fair guy.

472
00:38:33,116 --> 00:38:35,595
I'll match whatever this producer offers

473
00:38:35,596 --> 00:38:37,554
and I'll add two percent of the door.

474
00:38:37,555 --> 00:38:38,680
That's good business.

475
00:38:39,195 --> 00:38:42,030
- Thank you, but no.
- Aya.

476
00:38:42,396 --> 00:38:45,940
I said no thank you.
Excuse me.

477
00:38:49,275 --> 00:38:51,151
Well, I've got guests to show backstage.

478
00:38:51,155 --> 00:38:53,490
Let's get a technician
in to calibrate that bass.

479
00:38:57,155 --> 00:38:59,615
Put your hands together, ladies and gentlemen!

480
00:38:59,675 --> 00:39:05,680
Tonight's headline -
- All the way from Korea. U-Know!

481
00:39:14,154 --> 00:39:16,447
A mile out and we're traveling alone

482
00:39:16,595 --> 00:39:20,848
Things are calm and you were saying
Where are we going

483
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:25,792
Do you know the way?
Two miles out and the warning lights on

484
00:39:25,793 --> 00:39:30,005
And so I say the car's overheating

485
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:34,153
We're done for today
Think about the way that we came

486
00:39:34,155 --> 00:39:39,200
Doesn't make any difference
When it all breaks down

487
00:39:39,595 --> 00:39:44,515
Here we are
Running on empty

488
00:40:34,873 --> 00:40:35,748
Hey.

489
00:40:36,993 --> 00:40:40,621
What are you doing here? If Kaz sees you...

490
00:40:44,754 --> 00:40:48,715
Forget your brother. I came to see you.

491
00:40:49,433 --> 00:40:53,144
What we did last night I haven't done
something like that in a long time.

492
00:40:54,832 --> 00:40:55,999
It was amazing.

493
00:40:57,153 --> 00:40:59,863
- It was okay.
- Okay?

494
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:03,068
Whoa, what if I said I was holding back?

495
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,816
Then I'd say you're lying.

496
00:41:04,832 --> 00:41:06,500
Let's get out of here then and find out?

497
00:41:06,512 --> 00:41:10,515
- No, I can't. I have to work.
- This late?

498
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:15,432
Something happened at Static.
I don't know what it was.

499
00:41:16,072 --> 00:41:20,034
- You felt it, too.
- I don't even know you.

500
00:41:20,193 --> 00:41:24,447
- We can solve that problem.
- We can't solve anything.

501
00:41:24,752 --> 00:41:27,712
- Kaz, my brother could hurt you.
- I'm not afraid of him.

502
00:41:30,552 --> 00:41:33,804
There's the door, let's just get out
of here, okay? Nobody's looking.

503
00:41:37,232 --> 00:41:38,024
This way.

504
00:41:40,992 --> 00:41:41,992
Hi Aya.

505
00:41:42,352 --> 00:41:43,393
Rei, Kaori, I need your help.

506
00:41:45,432 --> 00:41:46,224
Hey.

507
00:41:46,312 --> 00:41:48,605
- What are you doing?
- Keep it on.

508
00:41:49,111 --> 00:41:51,350
Get him out of here... Hurry!

509
00:41:51,351 --> 00:41:52,476
Go! Go!

510
00:42:02,351 --> 00:42:04,310
I just want you to be successful.
You know that.

511
00:42:04,312 --> 00:42:05,729
I'm not going to work for Michael.

512
00:42:05,751 --> 00:42:08,169
I'll be here, okay. Nothing's going to happen.

513
00:42:08,191 --> 00:42:10,234
You can't always protect me.

514
00:42:13,551 --> 00:42:18,430
What if Nick's right?
What if all you did was steal his idea?

515
00:42:19,031 --> 00:42:22,869
Steal? He's the one who screwed me, okay.

516
00:42:22,871 --> 00:42:24,455
And you can't patent an idea.

517
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:27,989
I opened up a real club,
not some underground joint.

518
00:42:27,991 --> 00:42:32,077
Nick has to bend rules and skirt laws.
He can never do what I've done.

519
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:34,812
But how much of yourself have you given up?

520
00:42:40,911 --> 00:42:42,620
You're running out of time, Aya.

521
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,319
- Come on.
- Hey!

522
00:43:01,511 --> 00:43:03,261
I don't believe you paid the cover charge.

523
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,509
Yeah, your joint's over-priced.

524
00:43:10,831 --> 00:43:11,997
Did Nick send you?

525
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:15,963
No, I just wanted to see this dump for myself.

526
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:21,786
Well, now that you've seen it,
don't come back here no more.

527
00:43:21,949 --> 00:43:25,535
One thing. What kind of shampoo
does this guy use?

528
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:29,564
What is this? What is this?

529
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:31,632
Are you nuts? If someone sees.

530
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:32,878
It's Nick's brother.

531
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:34,899
You're that Wall Street prick, right?

532
00:43:35,389 --> 00:43:36,932
Yeah, he came looking for Aya.

533
00:43:45,909 --> 00:43:47,117
Oh. Come on, let's go. Let's go.

534
00:43:51,869 --> 00:43:52,953
His brother?

535
00:44:12,429 --> 00:44:18,059
This could not have been the plan
Be exactly where I am

536
00:44:18,069 --> 00:44:22,707
Never found a place to land
Never found a flame to fan

537
00:44:22,708 --> 00:44:26,378
You ditched my girls.
Did you get out OK?

538
00:44:29,309 --> 00:44:31,588
I won't get used to this

539
00:44:31,589 --> 00:44:34,827
No problem. So how do we end this mess
between our brothers?

540
00:44:34,828 --> 00:44:40,306
And the dreams that came upon us
Found out they don't really want us

541
00:44:40,308 --> 00:44:42,707
Chase them down and let them go

542
00:44:42,709 --> 00:44:44,987
They run faster than you hoped

543
00:44:44,988 --> 00:44:46,280
You don't give up, do you?

544
00:44:47,028 --> 00:44:51,306
I used to. All the time

545
00:44:51,308 --> 00:44:54,026
Could I hold you like a secret?

546
00:44:54,028 --> 00:44:56,446
If I was strong enough to keep it

547
00:44:57,868 --> 00:45:03,122
I want to fall for you, babe

548
00:45:03,268 --> 00:45:08,188
I know it's nothing new, babe

549
00:45:08,667 --> 00:45:13,546
Why does it all seem so hard lately?

550
00:45:14,147 --> 00:45:19,402
I want to fall for you

551
00:45:21,027 --> 00:45:22,069
Come on, man.

552
00:45:22,867 --> 00:45:28,830
If you won't go out with me,
can we at least dance again?

553
00:45:29,188 --> 00:45:30,746
I don't know.

554
00:45:30,747 --> 00:45:35,418
Why does it all seem so hard lately?

555
00:45:35,867 --> 00:45:39,505
I want to fall for you

556
00:45:39,507 --> 00:45:41,626
I do. How about tomorrow?

557
00:45:41,628 --> 00:45:45,146
I want to fall for you

558
00:45:45,147 --> 00:45:47,691
Busy teaching class at B-LIVE.

559
00:45:48,346 --> 00:45:50,806
I'll join in!

560
00:45:54,867 --> 00:45:59,371
You'll never keep up!

561
00:45:59,906 --> 00:46:01,531
Five, six, seven, eight...

562
00:46:02,867 --> 00:46:04,409
Turn, jump!
Turn, jump!

563
00:46:08,227 --> 00:46:09,018
Right!

564
00:46:09,907 --> 00:46:10,615
Left!

565
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:16,689
Ho! Ho! Wow! Amazing. Next group.

566
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:18,984
Thanks.

567
00:46:23,266 --> 00:46:26,477
- Hey, I'm here, right? Let's go.
- Okay.

568
00:46:27,266 --> 00:46:28,433
You ready?

569
00:46:28,706 --> 00:46:30,123
- Yeah. You want to speed up?
- Okay.

570
00:46:30,347 --> 00:46:33,057
- Speed up?
- Let's go. Five, six, seven, eight!

571
00:46:34,106 --> 00:46:35,398
Turn, jump!
Turn, jump!

572
00:46:38,586 --> 00:46:39,711
Hey! Hey! Hey!

573
00:46:42,827 --> 00:46:44,202
Come on. That wasn't bad, right?

574
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:48,012
I mean, it wasn't great, but it wasn't bad.

575
00:46:48,385 --> 00:46:52,764
- Rookie.
- Sorry.

576
00:46:57,106 --> 00:46:59,315
Okay, Bye bye. Good night. Bye.

577
00:47:06,585 --> 00:47:07,752
Nice class.

578
00:47:12,025 --> 00:47:13,567
Can't you take a hint?

579
00:47:14,545 --> 00:47:18,298
I'm not going anywhere.
Not without that dance?

580
00:47:21,666 --> 00:47:22,916
All right, one dance.

581
00:47:23,945 --> 00:47:25,612
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

582
00:47:34,864 --> 00:47:43,462
I... I never planned to hold out my hand

583
00:47:43,465 --> 00:47:48,177
So take it or let it go

584
00:47:48,744 --> 00:47:54,123
If you feel it inside

585
00:47:54,145 --> 00:47:57,623
The love in your eyes

586
00:47:57,624 --> 00:48:03,838
Cause sometimes
You never know

587
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:08,263
The lines of faith

588
00:48:08,265 --> 00:48:11,684
The walls come down

589
00:48:11,944 --> 00:48:16,281
And I'll be waiting

590
00:48:25,264 --> 00:48:27,702
So let me in

591
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:31,081
I won't let you fall

592
00:48:31,224 --> 00:48:33,743
We could have it all

593
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:39,822
'Cause in our dreams things are better
Than what they've been

594
00:48:39,824 --> 00:48:43,785
So let me in

595
00:48:53,703 --> 00:48:56,142
So let me in

596
00:48:56,144 --> 00:48:59,146
I won't let you fall

597
00:48:59,543 --> 00:49:02,022
We could have it all

598
00:49:02,023 --> 00:49:04,461
Cause in our dreams things are better

599
00:49:04,463 --> 00:49:12,178
Than what they've been
So let me in

600
00:49:14,422 --> 00:49:15,756
How did I do, teach?

601
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:18,078
I give you an F.

602
00:49:18,184 --> 00:49:21,645
But for extra credit,
I'll let you buy me dinner.

603
00:49:22,623 --> 00:49:26,167
So let me in

604
00:49:27,662 --> 00:49:30,539
- No, no, you don't have to do that.
- Nick, you've got to see this.

605
00:49:30,663 --> 00:49:31,579
Red Bull's on the line.

606
00:49:31,583 --> 00:49:32,750
They're cancelling our sponsorship.

607
00:49:32,782 --> 00:49:35,951
Here's why. This just got posted.

608
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:43,772
Links are everywhere. YouTube, Facebook,
Yelp, foursquare.

609
00:49:45,942 --> 00:49:48,069
- Let go of her. You're hurting her.
- What?

610
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:55,900
Shit didn't happen like that.
There were no gunshots.

611
00:49:55,903 --> 00:49:59,155
"Static, Brooklyn. Avoid at all costs."

612
00:50:00,422 --> 00:50:02,006
He's trying to shut us down.

613
00:50:05,141 --> 00:50:09,728
If you want the digs
you have to pay premium. Premium.

614
00:50:11,062 --> 00:50:13,606
No, no, no. Screw you, Lawrence.

615
00:50:15,061 --> 00:50:18,981
Damn Brits again.
They don't take no for an answer.

616
00:50:19,103 --> 00:50:22,221
DJ samples. And you still need
to approve these.

617
00:50:22,222 --> 00:50:23,180
Thanks.

618
00:50:26,021 --> 00:50:29,107
They're not going to renew her visa again.
You know that, right.

619
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,056
She may never feel the same way about you.

620
00:50:31,182 --> 00:50:34,934
Then again she might...
if she just gives it a chance.

621
00:50:35,101 --> 00:50:37,352
Why her? I mean, you can have anyone you want.

622
00:50:37,741 --> 00:50:42,953
She's not anyone. Man, she fights.
She doesn't quit.

623
00:50:43,502 --> 00:50:46,963
Look, I can have the paperwork done by Monday.
I have an attorney on standby.

624
00:50:47,541 --> 00:50:48,708
Is she going to work here or not?

625
00:50:49,621 --> 00:50:52,179
So what? Stealing my ideas wasn't enough?

626
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:53,431
- Step back.
- Don't try.

627
00:50:54,181 --> 00:50:55,556
Now you're trying to ruin me?

628
00:50:55,781 --> 00:50:57,407
I take it you're not here for a drink.

629
00:50:57,421 --> 00:50:59,900
Don't play stupid with me, man.
It's all over the Internet.

630
00:50:59,901 --> 00:51:01,777
- You got some nerve.
- Man, shut up!

631
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:05,200
- You like the club?
- Look, Kaz built everything you have.

632
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:07,257
He found your promotions, your sponsors

633
00:51:07,262 --> 00:51:09,763
and took your hole-in-the-wall club
to the next level.

634
00:51:09,901 --> 00:51:14,196
And where do you get off sitting
in my VIP with a boner for his sister?

635
00:51:16,739 --> 00:51:19,658
So what does it feel like pimping
her out to this fool anyway?

636
00:51:20,261 --> 00:51:21,761
You didn't keep your promises, huh!

637
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:25,099
- All I wanted was to be treated fairly.
- You were a damn street artist.

638
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,434
Get out now or I'm calling the cops!

639
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,252
Go on. Pizza will get here faster.

640
00:51:28,299 --> 00:51:31,178
We were partners
and you kept everything for yourself.

641
00:51:31,181 --> 00:51:32,515
You were hired help.

642
00:51:32,541 --> 00:51:37,045
Unless you're here for that drink,
I have a business to run.

643
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:41,548
Yeah. Well, so do I.
And that's the last time I plan on saying it.

644
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:49,542
Hey, and tell that runt brother of yours to
stay the hell away

645
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:05,514
I still can't get those drums of yours
out of my head. They were great.

646
00:52:06,019 --> 00:52:08,297
They're from Asia. It's called Taiko.

647
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,844
What's that lettering on the front of
your drums? What does that mean?

648
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:14,154
Cobu. It's the name of our crew.

649
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:15,370
Cobu?

650
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:20,211
It means, dance like drumming,
drum like dancing.

651
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:23,624
Drum like dancing. I like that.

652
00:52:24,659 --> 00:52:26,578
One producer's interested in us

653
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:29,081
but she has to see us play live.

654
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:33,799
And if she backs us, I'll be able to stay.

655
00:52:34,659 --> 00:52:36,952
- Stay?
- In America.

656
00:52:37,778 --> 00:52:40,906
- Otherwise you have to leave?
- In three weeks.

657
00:52:41,018 --> 00:52:42,143
That's crazy. Wait.

658
00:52:42,818 --> 00:52:46,656
If this lady signs you then she can
get you a work visa, right?

659
00:52:46,659 --> 00:52:53,206
Yeah, but it costs money to book a space.
And... I'm broke.

660
00:52:54,097 --> 00:52:55,181
What are you going to do?

661
00:52:56,899 --> 00:52:57,857
Change the subject.

662
00:52:57,899 --> 00:52:58,899
That's what you're going to do?

663
00:52:59,419 --> 00:53:02,697
Uh huh. Okay. All right. All right.
I won't ask anymore.

664
00:53:02,698 --> 00:53:04,866
So what's next for you?

665
00:53:05,538 --> 00:53:06,413
What do you mean?

666
00:53:06,457 --> 00:53:08,292
Are you going to perform in Static?

667
00:53:09,099 --> 00:53:11,309
Nick and I, we have issues.

668
00:53:11,378 --> 00:53:15,297
I know he wants the best for me,
but you know, the whole older brother thing?

669
00:53:15,298 --> 00:53:16,131
Oh yeah. It gets old.

670
00:53:16,298 --> 00:53:19,258
I know. There's so much
I can't tell my brother.

671
00:53:19,338 --> 00:53:27,137
Well, you know, sometimes I've learned it's better
not to say anything. Easier, too.

672
00:53:27,897 --> 00:53:30,816
What? Is there something you want to say?

673
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:40,686
You know, dancing, I like it,
but it's been more about making money for me.

674
00:53:42,656 --> 00:53:43,740
I don't get it.

675
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:47,136
Well, when I move my feet,
people are all watching what I'm doing

676
00:53:47,138 --> 00:53:49,514
instead of paying attention to
what's going on around them.

677
00:53:49,898 --> 00:53:52,107
I was just a distraction.

678
00:53:52,377 --> 00:53:54,169
I was working with a bunch of different guys,

679
00:53:54,176 --> 00:53:56,295
you know, pickpockets,
credit card thieves, you name it.

680
00:53:56,297 --> 00:53:58,673
Just about anything you can
take from tourists, we did.

681
00:54:00,058 --> 00:54:03,226
I was young, but I knew better.

682
00:54:04,777 --> 00:54:12,450
This one guy was working a pretty big scam
and one day I got caught.

683
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:16,435
And I had to serve two years in jail.

684
00:54:25,497 --> 00:54:26,872
Would you do it again?

685
00:54:30,176 --> 00:54:36,223
No. No, I've moved on from all that.

686
00:54:38,896 --> 00:54:40,188
Do you mean that?

687
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:48,383
Yeah. Yeah, I mean that.

688
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,751
I love the way you talk.

689
00:54:57,016 --> 00:54:58,684
- Shut up.
- No, I do.

690
00:54:58,697 --> 00:55:02,450
The way your words sound. It's just cute.

691
00:55:02,576 --> 00:55:06,745
I'm trying. Anyways, this is it.

692
00:55:08,376 --> 00:55:12,379
How do you say it in Japanese, good night?

693
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:18,230
- Oyasuminasai. Oyasim... what?
- And in Korean jo-eun-koom-ku-wo.

694
00:55:21,736 --> 00:55:22,736
Can you speak both?

695
00:55:23,376 --> 00:55:26,003
I'm Korean blood, born in Japan.

696
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:28,707
Our histories are long and complicated.

697
00:55:29,175 --> 00:55:31,051
Maybe it's why I love it here.

698
00:55:33,576 --> 00:55:39,038
All right, oyasu--
What is it?

699
00:55:54,494 --> 00:55:56,370
Your grades are improving.

700
00:55:57,935 --> 00:55:59,477
Night. Night.

701
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:06,320
- You can teach me that one tomorrow.
- Maybe.

702
00:56:22,494 --> 00:56:24,203
- Hey, boss.
- What's up, Jim?

703
00:56:24,415 --> 00:56:28,168
Get everything you can for me
on a real pain in the ass, Donny Bray.

704
00:56:28,254 --> 00:56:31,212
He's a dancer from New Orleans. Call me back.

705
00:56:31,213 --> 00:56:32,046
Yes, sir.

706
00:56:40,494 --> 00:56:41,243
Kaz here.

707
00:56:41,493 --> 00:56:43,328
Your sisters been hanging out
with Nick's brother

708
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:45,751
and I expect you to do something about it.

709
00:56:47,734 --> 00:56:50,402
Kaz, these are Michael's guest from Britain.
This is Lawrence.

710
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:51,911
Dublin, lassie, not Britain.

711
00:56:51,934 --> 00:56:54,269
And I've been waiting an hour.
The sod's ducking me.

712
00:56:54,293 --> 00:56:55,752
Sorry, Michael's been delayed.

713
00:56:55,853 --> 00:56:58,730
He'll be crapping his pants
if I get my hands around his neck.

714
00:56:58,893 --> 00:57:02,479
Why don't you guys enjoy yourselves
tonight, okay? Natsumi, buy these men a drink.

715
00:57:04,334 --> 00:57:07,419
I'll take your drink.
But I'm not enjoying shit!

716
00:57:20,973 --> 00:57:22,391
Everybody check this out.

717
00:57:22,493 --> 00:57:24,971
I want to give a toast to my man Kaz,

718
00:57:24,973 --> 00:57:27,350
hard work, blood, sweat and tears.

719
00:57:27,534 --> 00:57:30,619
Static is going to be a huge success.
Thank you, guys, for coming out.

720
00:57:35,973 --> 00:57:36,890
Love you.

721
00:57:39,133 --> 00:57:42,052
I owe this guy everything.
I owe this guy everything.

722
00:57:42,053 --> 00:57:45,651
Club Static's going to be the
hottest club in New York

723
00:57:45,653 --> 00:57:49,405
Here's the tally for tonight.
Oh, and Aya left this for you.

724
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:52,009
Thanks.

725
00:58:38,732 --> 00:58:41,171
- Hello?
- Yo, D., this is me, man.

726
00:58:41,172 --> 00:58:44,049
Hey, Rene, what's up?
Your P.O. won't stop snooping around.

727
00:58:44,171 --> 00:58:45,922
Whatever you're doing you better do it quick.

728
00:58:45,972 --> 00:58:48,265
You're digging yourself in a hole
getting deeper every minute.

729
00:58:48,572 --> 00:58:50,031
- Okay, man, all right.
- Peace.

730
00:58:57,411 --> 00:59:00,497
We're off 15%. But it really hits us in VIP.

731
00:59:00,532 --> 00:59:02,032
Maybe it was just a slow night.

732
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:05,590
Back-to-back slow nights all
because of that damn video.

733
00:59:06,011 --> 00:59:07,303
Nick, what are you going to do?

734
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:09,245
Hey.

735
00:59:11,491 --> 00:59:12,491
Nick, what?

736
00:59:13,371 --> 00:59:14,496
Hey, can we talk?

737
00:59:15,811 --> 00:59:17,645
You got a lot of nerve, man.

738
00:59:17,891 --> 00:59:20,559
You disappear for four days
and you blow back in here.

739
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:22,295
Well, I'm here now, okay.

740
00:59:22,331 --> 00:59:23,706
It's too late. I got bigger problems.

741
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:25,898
All right, then, let me help. Put me to work.

742
00:59:26,011 --> 00:59:27,678
Fine. Whatever. Bobby!

743
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:29,065
You got another back to use.

744
00:59:29,091 --> 00:59:31,092
- No, not that.
- Well, then what?

745
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:32,612
What I do.

746
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:35,128
Look, man, I told you that New Orleans
thing ain't gonna cut it down here--

747
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:37,489
You said it.
You want this club to feel fresh and new.

748
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:38,573
Then mix it up.

749
00:59:39,531 --> 00:59:40,865
Come on, man, I can do this.

750
00:59:41,290 --> 00:59:42,332
Just give me a shot.

751
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:46,783
All right. We'll call it an audition.

752
00:59:47,291 --> 00:59:48,833
You'll be outside tonight.

753
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:51,215
Inside.

754
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:54,276
Inside and onstage.

755
00:59:58,651 --> 00:59:59,609
You got one shot.

756
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:01,447
One dance.

757
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:03,045
Don't blow it.

758
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:08,362
I'm going to want the house band, too.

759
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:12,062
Raphael's going to need your camera tonight.

760
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:20,008
And then he had an idea
for a routine and it wasn't bad.

761
01:00:20,009 --> 01:00:21,885
So maybe we should try it out sometime.

762
01:00:21,970 --> 01:00:25,264
You're supposed to be working. You've been
talking about this guy since I walked in.

763
01:00:25,329 --> 01:00:28,415
- No, I haven't.
- Yes, you have.

764
01:00:31,609 --> 01:00:34,820
Are you sure about this,
with everything that's going on?

765
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:38,066
I know. It makes no sense.

766
01:00:38,489 --> 01:00:41,867
You really do like him.
And you never like anybody.

767
01:00:44,089 --> 01:00:47,608
Okay. Okay. Most guys just take, you know.
They want to control me.

768
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:50,195
- Like Michael.
- And Kaz.

769
01:00:51,129 --> 01:00:54,840
Plus I'm always busy.
I don't have time for a guy.

770
01:00:55,649 --> 01:00:58,025
But this one, Donny?

771
01:01:00,209 --> 01:01:01,793
I want to make time for him.

772
01:01:03,488 --> 01:01:06,647
Well, don't worry.
You've only known him a few days.

773
01:01:06,649 --> 01:01:08,692
It won't last. He's a guy.

774
01:01:17,128 --> 01:01:19,797
Come see the dust fly tonight?

775
01:01:23,009 --> 01:01:25,594
Rehearsing now.

776
01:02:21,847 --> 01:02:24,056
Where is he? Is he going to do this or not?

777
01:02:40,607 --> 01:02:41,523
Hey, can I borrow these?

778
01:02:41,566 --> 01:02:43,275
- Yeah, no problem.
- Thanks.

779
01:02:48,487 --> 01:02:52,949
All right, people,
give it up for New Orleans in Da House!

780
01:03:25,886 --> 01:03:27,136
Excuse me.

781
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:35,853
Get it started!

782
01:04:09,845 --> 01:04:11,137
Four on the floor.

783
01:04:13,165 --> 01:04:14,123
Yeah, come on!

784
01:04:35,525 --> 01:04:36,525
Come on, get up here.

785
01:04:39,405 --> 01:04:40,822
All the hoofers, let's go.

786
01:05:20,763 --> 01:05:21,888
Hey! Let's go, come on, baby!

787
01:05:23,285 --> 01:05:24,159
That's right.

788
01:06:21,002 --> 01:06:25,130
That's my brother! That's my brother!
That's my brother!

789
01:06:57,841 --> 01:07:03,304
Woo! All right, well, this is it.
Make yourself at home.

790
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:06,897
- Do you want a drink?
- Oh no. I'm okay.

791
01:07:07,242 --> 01:07:08,867
We've got pretty good tap water in there.

792
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:10,149
No.

793
01:07:11,602 --> 01:07:15,563
I'm sorry it's such a mess.
I haven't really been staying here much.

794
01:07:21,761 --> 01:07:23,720
I was so proud of you tonight.

795
01:07:25,722 --> 01:07:26,555
Thanks.

796
01:07:28,601 --> 01:07:30,685
I probably wouldn't have done it
if it hadn't been for you.

797
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,545
Would you miss me
if I had to go back to Japan?

798
01:07:37,281 --> 01:07:38,323
More than you know.

799
01:08:05,241 --> 01:08:08,535
Look and see

800
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:14,729
Through the people
I'm waiting patiently

801
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:18,818
Let's break free

802
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:25,878
Together to the music and breathe

803
01:08:25,961 --> 01:08:28,959
You found me
You found me

804
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:31,119
In the middle of a crowd

805
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:33,918
You catch me
You catch me

806
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:38,965
In the bass and the sound of my heart

807
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:46,158
Oh, it's moving for you

808
01:08:46,159 --> 01:08:49,398
You found me
You found me

809
01:08:49,401 --> 01:08:54,358
In the middle of a crowd
You catch me. You catch me

810
01:08:54,359 --> 01:09:00,797
In the bass and the sound of my heart

811
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:05,804
It's moving for you

812
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:13,677
I want to feel you
I want to feel you

813
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,797
Breathe

814
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:26,068
Oh. Come and be with me
Come and be with me

815
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:32,438
Ooh, ooh. Oh you found me. You found me
In the middle of a crowd

816
01:09:32,439 --> 01:09:35,317
You catch me
You catch me

817
01:09:35,318 --> 01:09:40,113
In the bass and sound of my heart

818
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:47,015
It's moving for you

819
01:10:12,317 --> 01:10:15,569
Yo, yo, Donny!
Come get some breakfast over here, man.

820
01:10:15,598 --> 01:10:18,934
Just whipped up some grillades,
fried some beignets.

821
01:10:22,837 --> 01:10:24,463
Oh wow, okay.

822
01:10:26,518 --> 01:10:29,062
Now I know why you danced
like you had a hard on.

823
01:10:30,878 --> 01:10:32,253
Just wait here, okay?

824
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:39,108
- Come on, man, don't O.D. it.
- O.D.it?

825
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:41,196
What the hell are you thinking, man?
Kaz will come after you.

826
01:10:41,197 --> 01:10:43,615
- You guys created this together, man-
- Screw him!

827
01:10:43,717 --> 01:10:45,259
It's you and me now.

828
01:10:45,757 --> 01:10:49,218
We're back. And all those dreams
that we thought died,

829
01:10:49,357 --> 01:10:52,475
us running our own joint, hiring and firing,
making our own rules,

830
01:10:52,477 --> 01:10:55,312
- it can happen. It's happening now.
- No, man, that's you, Nick.

831
01:10:55,317 --> 01:10:56,735
That's always been about you.

832
01:10:56,757 --> 01:10:58,466
You want to dance now, fine.

833
01:10:58,957 --> 01:11:01,292
There. You just got paid to dance.

834
01:11:01,317 --> 01:11:04,569
Next shift is tonight at 10.
Just give up the girl.

835
01:11:07,037 --> 01:11:08,246
Not a chance.

836
01:11:16,957 --> 01:11:17,998
Does she know?

837
01:11:20,677 --> 01:11:23,053
Huh? Does she know you quit
everything you ever start?

838
01:11:23,996 --> 01:11:25,872
And when you think you have it,

839
01:11:26,476 --> 01:11:30,396
you hold it for five seconds and then
you let it go like you always do?

840
01:11:33,636 --> 01:11:35,387
- We're out.
- We? Oh, it's we now?

841
01:11:35,436 --> 01:11:36,978
- Get back here!
- I said we're out!

842
01:11:38,357 --> 01:11:39,440
I'm done.

843
01:11:43,476 --> 01:11:45,352
- What's going on?
- Come on.

844
01:11:45,356 --> 01:11:46,689
Donny, wait a second.

845
01:11:49,116 --> 01:11:50,116
Nick?

846
01:11:53,076 --> 01:11:53,951
Nick!

847
01:11:54,196 --> 01:11:56,489
- Is it done?
- What?

848
01:11:57,956 --> 01:12:00,916
You saw them.
She spent the night.

849
01:12:01,275 --> 01:12:02,651
I said, is it done?

850
01:12:04,236 --> 01:12:05,528
You can't do this now.

851
01:12:05,556 --> 01:12:08,558
Look, if you won't do it,
I'll hire somebody that will.

852
01:12:12,794 --> 01:12:17,507
- Ten minutes. It's still uploading.
- Thank you

853
01:12:28,115 --> 01:12:31,633
- I can't believe he talked to you that way.
- Forget it. That's Nick.

854
01:12:31,635 --> 01:12:34,794
Forget it?
Did you see the way he looked at me?

855
01:12:34,795 --> 01:12:38,006
- So much hate in his eyes.
- Listen, Aya, forget it. All right?

856
01:12:38,115 --> 01:12:40,616
- It's me and you now.
- Then what?

857
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:43,794
He's your brother, Kaz is mine.
We can't change that.

858
01:12:43,795 --> 01:12:46,297
Listen, I just told my brother
to shove it right there in front of you.

859
01:12:46,355 --> 01:12:47,730
Okay, if it wasn't for him, growing up,

860
01:12:47,755 --> 01:12:50,381
I'd get my ass kicked
three times a week instead of twice.

861
01:12:51,275 --> 01:12:54,319
- I'm feeling this, too.
- So you think I'm not?

862
01:12:56,235 --> 01:12:59,529
- You didn't answer my calls.
- Sorry. I had my phone off.

863
01:13:01,034 --> 01:13:01,867
What?

864
01:13:04,154 --> 01:13:05,279
What's going on?

865
01:13:06,035 --> 01:13:06,952
Speak English, already. Please.

866
01:13:06,995 --> 01:13:10,706
- Let's go, Aya. Now.
- I'll call you later, okay?

867
01:13:23,794 --> 01:13:24,585
Taxi!

868
01:13:24,673 --> 01:13:28,176
- I think we got it. We'll be in touch.
- Okay, thanks.

869
01:13:29,754 --> 01:13:32,339
They found the car ditched in an alley.
It had been stolen.

870
01:13:32,594 --> 01:13:35,153
- Was anyone hurt?
- Luckily, no.

871
01:13:35,154 --> 01:13:36,654
Yeah, but we could still get sued.

872
01:13:36,793 --> 01:13:38,627
And the police recommend
that we shut down for the weekend.

873
01:13:38,634 --> 01:13:41,010
- If things are that serious--
- Things are that serious.

874
01:13:41,153 --> 01:13:43,792
I got clients in from out of town.
This is bad for business.

875
01:13:43,794 --> 01:13:46,833
- This is bad for my investment.
- I'll handle Nick, okay?

876
01:13:46,834 --> 01:13:47,458
Nick!?

877
01:13:47,473 --> 01:13:49,975
Look, you've had your chance.
I'm taking care of it.

878
01:13:49,994 --> 01:13:51,870
- I'm relieving you of running Oto.
- What?

879
01:13:51,873 --> 01:13:54,291
- This is my club.
- This is our club.

880
01:13:54,394 --> 01:13:55,894
And I own fifty-one percent.

881
01:13:55,914 --> 01:13:58,040
- You can't do that!
- I can do that.

882
01:13:58,114 --> 01:14:00,824
After last night we'll be lucky
to draw half capacity.

883
01:14:01,033 --> 01:14:03,712
Stay on as a creative advisor, but you're
through with the day-to-day operations.

884
01:14:03,714 --> 01:14:05,172
I'm calling the shots now.

885
01:14:05,994 --> 01:14:07,828
What did you say to me? What did he say to me?

886
01:14:13,072 --> 01:14:14,072
Let him stay.

887
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:17,577
I want you to see this.

888
01:14:21,393 --> 01:14:24,270
Hey, guys, look at the headache
that was going on at Oto's last night.

889
01:14:24,312 --> 01:14:27,231
You want fun without the drama?
Check it outat Static.

890
01:14:32,273 --> 01:14:35,232
- I didn't know.
- Why would we believe a word you say?

891
01:14:35,233 --> 01:14:36,608
I don't care what you believe, Kaz.

892
01:14:36,633 --> 01:14:40,311
- Well, after all the lies your brother told?
- You stole from him. All right?

893
01:14:40,313 --> 01:14:41,563
You gonna step to me?

894
01:14:41,752 --> 01:14:42,961
Screw you.

895
01:14:43,792 --> 01:14:44,834
Break his legs!

896
01:14:45,432 --> 01:14:47,225
- He didn't do it!
- Out back!

897
01:14:47,232 --> 01:14:49,609
- Get off!
- I was with him all night!

898
01:14:51,912 --> 01:14:53,913
He didn't do it, okay.

899
01:14:58,072 --> 01:15:00,907
Donny, I think you should go.

900
01:15:01,432 --> 01:15:02,348
Aya.

901
01:15:02,673 --> 01:15:03,589
Please.

902
01:15:07,913 --> 01:15:08,746
Okay.

903
01:15:25,991 --> 01:15:26,866
You back?

904
01:15:27,072 --> 01:15:29,115
There's a slot open at 12 if you want it.

905
01:15:31,031 --> 01:15:32,531
Somebody could have been killed.

906
01:15:32,792 --> 01:15:33,917
You used me!

907
01:15:35,231 --> 01:15:35,939
Let him go.

908
01:15:35,991 --> 01:15:36,824
Get off me!

909
01:15:39,191 --> 01:15:42,569
I get knocked down,
I get up and I keep fighting.

910
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:44,130
That's all either of us know how to do.

911
01:15:44,151 --> 01:15:45,270
Kaz didn't screw you.

912
01:15:45,271 --> 01:15:47,189
You screwed yourself 'cause you're an asshole!

913
01:15:47,191 --> 01:15:48,024
Nick!

914
01:15:48,871 --> 01:15:51,539
Nick! I couldn't stop them.

915
01:15:52,151 --> 01:15:53,943
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what is this? Where's B?

916
01:15:53,951 --> 01:15:56,629
B's suspended.
So are the others you bought off.

917
01:15:56,631 --> 01:15:58,883
This building was condemned in '09.

918
01:15:59,031 --> 01:16:03,189
You sublet it from a management company
that's not even licensed.

919
01:16:03,191 --> 01:16:06,190
This is his property now.
And we're here to escort you off the premises.

920
01:16:06,191 --> 01:16:08,066
What? You can't throw me out.

921
01:16:08,112 --> 01:16:10,822
We can if you've been running an illegal club.

922
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:14,623
Serving alcohol, without a license,
violating safety and fire codes.

923
01:16:14,671 --> 01:16:15,963
I built this. This is mine!

924
01:16:15,991 --> 01:16:18,409
- Not anymore!
- Everyone out now! Let's go.

925
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:22,702
I close million dollar deals
before morning coffee.

926
01:16:23,071 --> 01:16:25,989
This, this is nothing.

927
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:29,829
And you, white trash with gourmet Chinese.

928
01:16:29,830 --> 01:16:31,080
Stick to dollar carry-out.

929
01:16:32,030 --> 01:16:33,155
You son of a bitch!

930
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:34,545
Donny!

931
01:16:34,671 --> 01:16:36,338
Restrain that man right now!
Let's go! Grab him.

932
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:39,043
Get him out of here.
Get him out of her right now. Let's go.

933
01:16:39,071 --> 01:16:40,113
Did you see that!?

934
01:16:43,389 --> 01:16:44,848
That's assault, pal.

935
01:16:56,390 --> 01:16:57,306
Open up.

936
01:17:07,269 --> 01:17:09,938
She's okay. She's okay. She's with me.

937
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:45,292
Bray! You're lucky.

938
01:17:45,508 --> 01:17:47,134
Someone wants to cut you a break.

939
01:17:48,629 --> 01:17:49,629
Let's go.

940
01:17:57,428 --> 01:18:00,764
Give us five minutes.
We don't need those, do we?

941
01:18:02,468 --> 01:18:05,219
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

942
01:18:14,508 --> 01:18:15,675
So I know everything.

943
01:18:16,388 --> 01:18:18,931
I know that you jumped parole
back in Louisiana.

944
01:18:20,908 --> 01:18:21,783
What?

945
01:18:22,629 --> 01:18:25,756
Whoops. You forgot to mention that, didn't you?

946
01:18:25,948 --> 01:18:29,075
Aya, I... it's complicated.

947
01:18:29,548 --> 01:18:31,257
Cops don't know it, yet.

948
01:18:31,388 --> 01:18:33,097
But as soon as they run your priors
they'll find out

949
01:18:33,107 --> 01:18:36,735
and then you'll be back to New Orleans
and back in jail for parole violation.

950
01:18:37,188 --> 01:18:39,481
You had six months left. That's what?

951
01:18:40,428 --> 01:18:42,471
Six more months behind bars.

952
01:18:42,868 --> 01:18:45,703
Ouch. Doesn't have to be that way.

953
01:18:46,828 --> 01:18:52,626
Here's the deal.
That remains our little secret.

954
01:18:52,628 --> 01:18:54,946
I don't press charges
and you're free to walk out of here

955
01:18:54,947 --> 01:18:56,426
and get on the next plane, train, bus,

956
01:18:56,427 --> 01:18:58,136
I really don't care what,

957
01:18:58,147 --> 01:19:00,648
back to New Orleans
to never come back here again.

958
01:19:01,588 --> 01:19:02,963
And you come work for me.

959
01:19:05,388 --> 01:19:06,263
Aya, no.

960
01:19:06,467 --> 01:19:08,176
Keep your little friend here out of jail.

961
01:19:08,188 --> 01:19:09,646
- Don't do it.
- Shut up.

962
01:19:10,747 --> 01:19:12,456
And I give your brother his job back.

963
01:19:16,348 --> 01:19:18,826
Now, normally, I like to give my clients

964
01:19:18,827 --> 01:19:20,911
once I put the deal on the table.

965
01:19:22,307 --> 01:19:23,724
Your time starts now.

966
01:19:30,347 --> 01:19:33,349
He can't do this. I mean,
who the hell does he think he is?

967
01:19:36,467 --> 01:19:40,025
Aya, I'm sorry, okay. I tried to tell you.
I wanted to tell you in the restaurant.

968
01:19:40,027 --> 01:19:43,655
It doesn't matter now. I'm not even angry.

969
01:19:46,186 --> 01:19:46,936
Where are you going?

970
01:19:46,986 --> 01:19:48,361
To accept his offer.

971
01:19:48,386 --> 01:19:50,865
No, Aya, you can't! I don't want you
paying for my mistakes.

972
01:19:50,866 --> 01:19:55,662
There's nothing you can do.
If you don't leave, you go back to jail.

973
01:19:56,187 --> 01:19:58,021
- I won't let that happen.
- I'll be fine, all right?

974
01:19:58,026 --> 01:20:00,486
- Don't worry about me.
- Donny, take a look around.

975
01:20:01,146 --> 01:20:02,772
Look where we are.

976
01:20:07,946 --> 01:20:11,782
We had our time but you and I are over.

977
01:20:28,426 --> 01:20:30,845
So he's dropping the charges.
You're free to go.

978
01:21:07,185 --> 01:21:12,731
Wake up in the mornin.
Trying to wish the night away

979
01:21:15,545 --> 01:21:21,800
Hiding in the corner.
Waiting for the light to change

980
01:21:23,904 --> 01:21:27,903
Yeah. And you can tell yourself.
The drama doesn't help

981
01:21:27,905 --> 01:21:32,492
Good luck getting out of your own way

982
01:21:32,624 --> 01:21:36,343
Praying you can stop,
chasing everything you're not

983
01:21:36,344 --> 01:21:41,265
Making all the same mistakes

984
01:21:41,505 --> 01:21:47,263
Heaven forever slipping through my arms again

985
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:50,022
I'm dying inside me

986
01:21:50,024 --> 01:21:55,903
I know I'll find a way to hold on 'til the end

987
01:21:55,905 --> 01:21:58,503
The time will blame me

988
01:21:58,504 --> 01:22:02,822
This curse is on my back

989
01:22:02,824 --> 01:22:06,982
It's like it's got me trapped

990
01:22:06,984 --> 01:22:12,942
But I will keep on trying. I'll go on reaching
'til the world is in my hands

991
01:22:12,943 --> 01:22:18,072
I'm catching shadows

992
01:22:24,063 --> 01:22:30,235
Oh, oh, oh, Heaven forever
slipping through my arms again...

993
01:22:30,264 --> 01:22:31,681
- Hey, it's me.
- Nick is looking for you.

994
01:22:31,704 --> 01:22:33,079
Yeah, I know Nick's looking for me.

995
01:22:33,103 --> 01:22:34,979
Just listen.
I need your help with something okay.

996
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:38,461
...hold on till the end

997
01:22:38,462 --> 01:22:42,966
I'm catching shadows

998
01:22:47,342 --> 01:22:50,261
- Is it on?
- Yeah, it's ready.

999
01:22:52,063 --> 01:22:54,314
I left New Orleans Monday night.

1000
01:22:54,584 --> 01:22:56,752
A day later everything changed.

1001
01:22:57,263 --> 01:23:02,501
That's when I met Aya.
Since then, a lot has happened.

1002
01:23:02,502 --> 01:23:06,630
It's been pretty crazy. And some of it
you've probably even seen on here.

1003
01:23:07,223 --> 01:23:10,421
As of today, the two hottest clubs
in Brooklyn are gone.

1004
01:23:10,422 --> 01:23:11,756
They shut down Static.

1005
01:23:11,782 --> 01:23:13,742
Took it from Nick and everyone who works there.

1006
01:23:14,101 --> 01:23:17,812
And Kaz has been demoted.
Oto will never be the same.

1007
01:23:18,503 --> 01:23:21,941
Yeah, maybe Nick and Kaz went too far
and let their egos get in the way,

1008
01:23:21,942 --> 01:23:26,237
but these guys created something special.
Something visionary.

1009
01:23:26,621 --> 01:23:28,414
But who really brought them down?

1010
01:23:28,742 --> 01:23:33,261
Some bullshit operator on Wall Street.
An asshole who ruined everything for everyone.

1011
01:23:33,263 --> 01:23:35,681
One of those guys who has money
but nothing else.

1012
01:23:35,822 --> 01:23:39,324
No vision. No morals,
but they wind up with all this power.

1013
01:23:40,222 --> 01:23:43,808
So what are we going to do now?
Do we just stand by and let this go down?

1014
01:23:44,502 --> 01:23:46,670
Not me. Not anymore.

1015
01:23:47,821 --> 01:23:49,531
I'm not going to throw the towel in this time.

1016
01:23:50,021 --> 01:23:53,100
I'm making things happen now.
I'll start something new.

1017
01:23:53,103 --> 01:23:55,604
Bringing artists together
just like Nick and Kaz did.

1018
01:23:56,902 --> 01:23:59,237
So I'm hosting a pop-up club tonight.

1019
01:23:59,781 --> 01:24:02,300
If you guys want to come down
and check this place out.

1020
01:24:02,301 --> 01:24:04,802
It's going to be a great night,
no cover charge.

1021
01:24:05,542 --> 01:24:07,210
And, you know, what? Drinks are free.

1022
01:24:07,662 --> 01:24:09,037
Whoa? Free drinks?

1023
01:24:09,381 --> 01:24:11,883
Listen, we got to fill this place up.
We got to get them here somehow, right?

1024
01:24:17,622 --> 01:24:19,873
- What if this doesn't work?
- It has to.

1025
01:24:20,822 --> 01:24:23,020
Listen, just get everyone together, okay?

1026
01:24:23,021 --> 01:24:25,259
Go back to Static, raid the liquor stash.

1027
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:26,678
We got a lot of work to do.

1028
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:30,953
But don't tell Aya. Not yet.
We got to time this just right.

1029
01:24:35,501 --> 01:24:36,793
Hi. I'm looking for a Camille.

1030
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:38,654
- Camille Young?
- Yes?

1031
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:43,356
Hi. I'm with Cobu. I'm the manager.

1032
01:24:43,461 --> 01:24:44,753
Who are you and what are you talking about?

1033
01:24:44,781 --> 01:24:47,499
The group with the girls and the drums.

1034
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:49,334
I've seen their stuff. You got to check
these guys out. They're amazing.

1035
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:52,362
And I came to give you this. It's tonight.

1036
01:24:52,699 --> 01:24:55,138
They're going to be there with a live audience

1037
01:24:55,141 --> 01:24:56,933
and everything you need
to see these guys in action.

1038
01:24:56,940 --> 01:24:58,232
Very nice. Thank you.

1039
01:24:58,581 --> 01:25:00,164
Wait. You got to. Just...

1040
01:25:05,059 --> 01:25:07,519
And it starts at 10.
So I'll see you there, right?

1041
01:25:09,460 --> 01:25:10,377
Maybe.

1042
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:14,160
Rocketeer Entertainment. May I help you?

1043
01:25:14,180 --> 01:25:15,096
Sorry.

1044
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:31,170
Thank you.

1045
01:25:31,780 --> 01:25:35,658
I knew you'd stick around.
I think you're the only honest person I know.

1046
01:25:36,059 --> 01:25:39,603
This is business.
You never touch me, you never try.

1047
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:46,058
Exclusive terms.
My immigration lawyer is the best.

1048
01:25:46,059 --> 01:25:49,020
- He'll look after everything you need.
- And Kaz?

1049
01:25:49,059 --> 01:25:52,061
Well, I tried calling him
and he hasn't called me back.

1050
01:25:52,658 --> 01:25:55,535
Maybe you can give him a shout
and talk some sense into him.

1051
01:25:58,139 --> 01:25:59,848
I'll need you to sign where it's indicated.

1052
01:26:02,218 --> 01:26:03,677
Don't I get two minutes?

1053
01:26:05,178 --> 01:26:06,553
Why don't you read it over?

1054
01:26:07,019 --> 01:26:09,271
You can bring it back with you
tomorrow night when you start.

1055
01:26:14,939 --> 01:26:17,023
Hey, it's Donny, Nick's brother.

1056
01:26:17,378 --> 01:26:20,088
Listen, I need your help promoting something.

1057
01:26:21,219 --> 01:26:25,055
Big news going down
in Brooklyn tonight, people...

1058
01:26:25,138 --> 01:26:29,767
Running through this city.
I've been gone so long...

1059
01:26:29,938 --> 01:26:33,024
He's expecting you.

1060
01:26:34,779 --> 01:26:39,157
Don't know how I'll make it

1061
01:26:39,218 --> 01:26:42,095
The guy's a wanker. Thinks I'm a Brit.

1062
01:26:42,859 --> 01:26:44,193
Thinks I'm Japanese.

1063
01:26:44,299 --> 01:26:47,009
He's been screwing me out
of deals for months now.

1064
01:26:47,778 --> 01:26:50,905
So the answer is, I'm interested.

1065
01:26:53,778 --> 01:26:56,780
Yo, Nick, it's past nine.
He's still not answering.

1066
01:26:56,978 --> 01:26:57,936
Forget him.

1067
01:26:59,658 --> 01:27:00,616
Yeah? Let's go.

1068
01:27:03,657 --> 01:27:04,491
Wait!

1069
01:27:05,777 --> 01:27:08,862
Your brother, he kind of made other plans.

1070
01:27:26,217 --> 01:27:27,092
What are you doing out here?

1071
01:27:27,097 --> 01:27:29,416
Kaz. Kaz, I have to show you
something right now.

1072
01:27:29,417 --> 01:27:32,627
- I got to go inside.
- Please. Please?

1073
01:27:34,618 --> 01:27:35,576
I'll be back.

1074
01:27:41,656 --> 01:27:45,367
- This place?
- Yeah. Come on.

1075
01:27:52,057 --> 01:27:55,392
- All right, so where is he?
- Give it a minute.

1076
01:28:01,217 --> 01:28:02,509
What's he doing here?

1077
01:28:03,456 --> 01:28:04,874
What's this about?

1078
01:28:04,936 --> 01:28:06,561
I told you. Can you wait a little bit?

1079
01:28:06,977 --> 01:28:07,810
Come on.

1080
01:28:09,618 --> 01:28:10,409
Wait.

1081
01:28:11,416 --> 01:28:13,334
- Did you know Nick was here?
- Yes.

1082
01:28:13,417 --> 01:28:15,126
Trust me. Camille's going to be here.

1083
01:28:16,496 --> 01:28:17,455
There she is..

1084
01:28:20,777 --> 01:28:21,944
I'll be right back.

1085
01:28:24,176 --> 01:28:25,093
What's up, man?

1086
01:28:25,976 --> 01:28:28,227
Hey, welcome to Oto. Under new management.

1087
01:28:29,935 --> 01:28:32,734
Thought there'd be a few more people, too.
It's early, go have a seat.

1088
01:28:32,737 --> 01:28:34,780
- What are you drinking?
- Scotch.

1089
01:28:35,016 --> 01:28:38,310
Scotch. Excuse me, sweetheart.
Can you get a scotch for my friend? Thanks.

1090
01:28:43,775 --> 01:28:45,651
Somebody hacked into our mailing list.

1091
01:28:58,376 --> 01:29:00,335
I left New Orleans Monday night.

1092
01:29:01,136 --> 01:29:02,970
A day later everything changed.

1093
01:29:03,496 --> 01:29:05,580
That's when I met Aya.

1094
01:29:15,655 --> 01:29:19,324
All my life I've charged
into things without thinking.

1095
01:29:19,655 --> 01:29:26,160
Doing some pretty dumb stuff.
But I want to get something right.

1096
01:29:26,974 --> 01:29:30,977
I'm not going to throw the towel in this time.
Not on you.

1097
01:29:33,896 --> 01:29:36,022
I left New Orleans Monday night.

1098
01:29:36,495 --> 01:29:38,579
A day later everything changed.

1099
01:32:07,612 --> 01:32:10,030
I can't believe you did all this.

1100
01:32:10,451 --> 01:32:13,954
I couldn't leave town,
not without one last dance.

1101
01:32:16,491 --> 01:32:20,619
- End this now!
- I already did.

1102
01:32:20,972 --> 01:32:23,348
I sold my 49% share in Oto.

1103
01:32:23,691 --> 01:32:24,482
What?

1104
01:32:25,412 --> 01:32:28,247
Oh, and by the way, meet your new partner.

1105
01:32:28,971 --> 01:32:30,013
Come on!

1106
01:32:33,612 --> 01:32:36,780
You know what's worse than being partners
with a pissed off Irishman?

1107
01:32:36,892 --> 01:32:39,977
- What?
- When he's pissed at you, friend.

1108
01:32:41,691 --> 01:32:46,861
Hey come on, Kaz.
Kaz, you can't do this.

1109
01:32:54,291 --> 01:32:56,500
Kaz! Don't touch the shirt.

1110
01:32:57,091 --> 01:32:58,050
Excuse me!

1111
01:33:04,531 --> 01:33:06,615
Coming through. Excuse me.

1112
01:34:30,849 --> 01:34:34,847
If I hold you closer
would you make me set you free

1113
01:34:34,849 --> 01:34:35,724
Hey, Kaz.

1114
01:34:37,849 --> 01:34:43,353
I'm not letting go.
So now I know it'st meant to be

1115
01:34:43,488 --> 01:34:46,866
Whenever you look at me.

1116
01:34:48,328 --> 01:34:51,887
It's time to celebrate. Throw'em up and go hard

1117
01:34:51,889 --> 01:34:55,367
We keep on doing what we're doing.
Like there is no tomorrow

1118
01:34:55,368 --> 01:34:59,446
So now you know I'm not messing around
Messing around

1119
01:34:59,448 --> 01:35:04,285
I'm never going to let you down

1120
01:35:08,888 --> 01:35:10,055
You finish this.

1121
01:35:11,968 --> 01:35:14,553
Alright, guys, come on! Come on!

1122
01:35:21,968 --> 01:35:23,135
Cobu! Here we go!

1123
01:35:50,927 --> 01:35:54,525
Girls! Can you see the love that's in our eyes

1124
01:35:54,527 --> 01:35:58,046
Can you feel your heart, it beats with mine

1125
01:35:58,048 --> 01:36:01,286
Now we know

1126
01:36:01,287 --> 01:36:06,166
So everybody goes...

1127
01:36:08,367 --> 01:36:09,408
Start tweeting.

1128
01:36:10,128 --> 01:36:13,505
We're live right now,
right outside of Bushwick,

1129
01:36:14,166 --> 01:36:16,925
witnessing something new and unseen.

1130
01:36:16,927 --> 01:36:20,305
And I don't think about
what all these people have to say

1131
01:36:20,808 --> 01:36:24,144
So everybody. Just let your body

1132
01:36:24,247 --> 01:36:27,965
I said everybody. Let your body go

1133
01:36:27,966 --> 01:36:31,525
To let somebody know. Let's jump into the flow

1134
01:36:31,527 --> 01:36:35,085
we show. Let your body go

1135
01:36:35,087 --> 01:36:38,605
To let somebody know

1136
01:36:38,606 --> 01:36:42,124
Let's jump into the flow. Let your body go

1137
01:36:42,126 --> 01:36:45,645
And jump into the flow. This is how we show

1138
01:36:45,647 --> 01:36:49,483
So let somebody know

1139
01:36:59,087 --> 01:37:02,684
Can you see the love that's in our eyes

1140
01:37:02,685 --> 01:37:06,245
Can you feel your heart, it beats with mine

1141
01:37:06,247 --> 01:37:09,457
Now we know--

1142
01:37:11,206 --> 01:37:14,005
Aya, you're amazing. I'm so proud of you.
That was great.

1143
01:37:14,006 --> 01:37:16,925
Donny? What now?

1144
01:37:17,565 --> 01:37:20,644
I go back. I do time. I finish parole...

1145
01:37:20,646 --> 01:37:22,855
It doesn't matter. I'll get through it.

1146
01:37:25,686 --> 01:37:29,044
There you are. I loved what you did.

1147
01:37:29,045 --> 01:37:31,403
I want to see you in my office
first thing Monday.

1148
01:37:31,405 --> 01:37:32,655
Does this mean she can stay?

1149
01:37:33,045 --> 01:37:34,838
Bring your passport,
I'll take care of everything.

1150
01:37:35,406 --> 01:37:38,033
And you! You put all this together?

1151
01:37:39,245 --> 01:37:41,997
- He did.
- I want you dancing for me, as well.

1152
01:37:45,045 --> 01:37:49,131
Well, I'm kind of booked for the next
six months. I have to go back to Louisiana.

1153
01:37:49,205 --> 01:37:53,542
- But you're coming back?
- Nothing can stop me.

1154
01:38:02,364 --> 01:38:06,200
- We good?
- We're good.

1155
01:38:10,286 --> 01:38:12,284
- Did good, little brother.
- Thanks, man.

1156
01:38:12,285 --> 01:38:14,963
Hey, you know I brought your sax, right?
I brought your sax, you're playing it.

1157
01:38:14,964 --> 01:38:15,964
Let's go. Come on.

1158
01:38:16,004 --> 01:38:23,510
Now we know. So everybody goes...

1159
01:38:37,084 --> 01:38:40,723
Wow. Can you see the love that's in our eyes

1160
01:38:40,724 --> 01:38:44,202
Can you feel your heart, it beats with mine

1161
01:38:44,204 --> 01:38:52,003
Now we know. So everybody goes...

1162
01:38:58,364 --> 01:39:06,663
Now we know. So everybody goes...

It's like my feet never touch the ground

1166
01:40:01,802 --> 01:40:09,351
And all that was broken has been made new

1167
01:40:12,362 --> 01:40:16,117
And you can still hear the sound

1168
01:40:17,122 --> 01:40:24,169
A wish unspoken can still come true

1169
01:40:27,685 --> 01:40:31,017
You touched the deepest part of me

1170
01:40:32,481 --> 01:40:39,528
It feels like I'm dreaming and breathing love

1171
01:40:42,721 --> 01:40:46,265
Like the sun lights up the dark

1172
01:40:47,802 --> 01:40:54,057
There you are. You shine on me

1173
01:40:58,362 --> 01:41:09,539
And even when the mind is hard.
I can still hear your heart

1174
01:41:13,202 --> 01:41:18,081
Your heart beat.
It's like my feet never touch the ground

Oh, yeah. And you make me believe.
I could get lost in this feeling

1179
01:41:53,001 --> 01:41:57,462
I'm breathing love

1180
01:41:59,481 --> 01:42:03,067
Oh, you touched the deepest part of me

1181
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:12,232
It feels like I'm dreaming. I'm breathing love
