1
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,700
<b>THE BIG BANG</b>

2
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,900
Where is she?

3
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
- Thiele îþi cares what the fuck?
- I care, I care much.

4
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,400
- Is it alive?
- Want to know where he is, Cruz?

5
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:39,600
Want to know how it feels? When talking.
Every detail damned.

6
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,900
I can not see. I need a doctor.

7
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,700
Do you one as soon as we say
what the fuck is going on.

8
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:52,300
I think faking. Orbe're not a date.
I think fucking faking.

9
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,300
No. I heard of anything like this.
Head injury.

10
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,400
Will see again. In time to watch it
the judge in the eye when it condemns.

11
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,200
Condemns me? Why?

12
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,100
Choose. You did something mess... five dead.

13
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,100
- Five?
- Yes...

14
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,600
- I think you need to talk...
- With a Lawyer?

15
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,500
- Why you need a lawyer?
- You're not arrested.

16
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,300
So what's with these handcuffs?
Why do not you Tell me where is it, if it's good?

17
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,700
Because I ask questions here
and you answer.

18
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,200
My client... is alive?

19
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,100
I really do not know?

20
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,100
Play with us as if you're thinking.

21
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,000
If the standby to leave him, sitting here all night.

22
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,600
We do not want to think about and you do not want
to ask questions, Cruz. We want to answer.

23
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,600
Reflex.

24
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,500
I am a human lie detector.

25
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,300
If you do not tell the truth, you knock the ring-Thi
water head. And you love me.

26
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,400
Ready, ready...

27
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,400
Sorry, sorry.

28
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,100
Come on, entertain us.

29
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,200
You were there the night began.
Tell us.

30
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:42,000
He does it again. Not thinking, not shoot
time. A how do I say?

31
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:48,200
Well, Poley, but tell him Hairdressers
disappear. Shaver's loþiunea kill me.

32
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,500
- Skeres?
- Yes?

33
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,400
- Do you like Adam Nova?
- Actor?

34
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,000
It's good. I think I make good money.

35
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,100
20 million film.

36
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,800
One of the best players getting paid
in history

37
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,500
and I had to tell him
that everything is finished.

38
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:24,600
Shortly after his affair Nova
with a mogul,

39
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:29,000
mogul has paid a detective for low Speth
to throw mud in Nova.

40
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:34,000
Nova hired me to find out what kind of mud
that tabloid expose.

41
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:40,000
What information exists about Adam Nova?
What else brings out this time?

42
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm terrified.

43
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,100
We all have our little perversions.

44
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,300
Contrary to the words of science,

45
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,100
DNA is not well structured.

46
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,600
Adam, an open or not?

47
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,500
Mica is a perversion of man's Nova
albino named Russell.

48
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,500
These two have the habit to mix viagra
with methamphetamine

49
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,400
and hold the organ in the group by 48 hours.

50
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,600
Damn!

51
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,400
- What's up, buddy?
- It's your fault!

52
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,400
- Let me see!
- Wait fucking pervert!

53
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,900
Nova is finished.

54
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,900
When things like this
get on the internet

55
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,300
that is moving at light speed.

56
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,300
Suppose you want to get paid.

57
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,200
Wait here. Be right back.

58
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,000
Adam, stay a little!
Show me the fucking pictures!

59
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,800
Leave me the fuck alone!

60
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,300
Whatever it is, I can arrange.

61
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,400
We all have small perversions, but build
closets to hide them.

62
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,600
But there is always fear that one day,
someone comes into your closet,

63
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,100
flashing light and there in the corner,
is your weakness.

64
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,000
But the biggest fear of all...

65
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,900
... Afraid of being exposed.

66
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,700
Want to explain?

67
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:39,000
- Lotion after shave or cologne?
- What? After Shave Lotion.

68
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,700
What is your problem?

69
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,700
How is it that happens whenever
shit, you always find your base?

70
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:56,400
- What is it with the skewers?
- Astrophysics. Is called Russell.

71
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,900
It disappeared a white dwarf as a supernova.

72
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,400
It's 2:00 in the morning.
I am tired of Los Angeles.

73
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,000
Village to bury evidence
human tragedy,

74
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,100
loþiunea village barber's cheaper.

75
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:22,300
I too finished to go home.
He and I go to that office to hate me.

76
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,900
Perhaps the fault is my favorite jacket,
permanently destroyed

77
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,300
but once in, I do not like
my occupation.

78
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,100
Should I go home...

79
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,000
... I stick to the tub...

80
00:09:58,035 --> 00:10:00,900
... And to let water spill on my head.

81
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,000
But all I can do is to go back
at my own crimes.

82
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,300
- You're a private detective.
- Yes... I was a private detective.

83
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:29,200
Maybe someday I'll be in the FBI
and I cut out my way among others...

84
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:35,100
- I want someone finds you.
- Have someone in mind?

85
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,300
My name is Anthony. They call me "The Pro".

86
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:44,900
Well, Anton, listens...
Today I was treated a dog the way it

87
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:47,800
treats a fire hydrant. Currently,
I'll leave aside work...

88
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:54,000
Lexie is called.
Persimmon Lexie. It's my daughter.

89
00:10:54,500 --> 00:11:00,000
Whoever it is, I'm sure
he's in bed, dreaming of jumping rope.

90
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,000
Shame it would be your wake.

91
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:24,500
- What's the joke here?
- What does catch?

92
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
That's your girlfriend?

93
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,900
I wrote.

94
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,900
I wrote and I each Wednesday
for five years.

95
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,500
Perhaps you have a giant box of crayons.

96
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:52,300
But that's nothing, there is no house
given with the address.

97
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:59,300
Where did it ISPA and punishment?
What did you do prison?

98
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,700
No stamps or stamp mailbox.

99
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:09,100
Prisoners in federal prisons
letters were opened.

100
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:17,300
ISPA and I was it a life sentence in
in Lompoc, but they released me.

101
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,500
- Really?
- Now we have to find.

102
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,200
But she is not the Minkowski.

103
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,300
It and So come on, go to Minkowski.

104
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,300
If îþi write a letter and a perfume
with Chanel No 5,

105
00:12:39,335 --> 00:12:43,000
I believe if I tell you that over
on today?

106
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,900
That's worked here.

107
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,500
Ask him.

108
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,700
No bother. I've already said.
I never saw her.

109
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,400
I do not know who he was.

110
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,900
How many guards do you think I put down?

111
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:00,200
- Who the hell are you?
- Where is Minkowski?

112
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,500
Where you go when you die.

113
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,100
- How it seems thi?
- What the fuck, man?

114
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,600
Do not answer the questions with other questions.

115
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,900
Now you want to slow down and bring them to town?

116
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,500
- I go?
- Again?

117
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,700
What the hell?

118
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,800
- A Persimmon Lexie know you're on?
- Shit!

119
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,500
Asshole!

120
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:44,700
Right hook. Like a speed train
that appears behind the corner. And, I remember.

121
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
10 years ago, everyone had heard of Anton
The Pro Protopov.

122
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,800
Let's get out of here!

123
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,700
It was on the line. He joined
bang for the money.

124
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,700
Sorry... shit!

125
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,700
Skinny Faddeev, head of the Russian mafia
Los Angeles.

126
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,200
- Do not be stupid.
- We know who it was... Faddeev.

127
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,000
Are you sure that you know. So you know
and that the grandson's ready

128
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,800
to be the next heavyweight champion.

129
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,700
The Pro gave Anton Protopov
30 million in exchange

130
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,500
fall of his third round match
nephew's presentation.

131
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,100
But Anton The Pro does not really know and tea
concept.

132
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:51,300
Of course, if your opponent and crush îþi

133
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,500
and then you put down to be counted,
nobody believes you.

134
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's a idioþenie.

135
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,100
Anthony's career in The Pro Boxing
had end.

136
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,100
- Man, there!
- Do you have pictures, letters, find it.

137
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,200
I do better without your help.

138
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,300
- Sometimes... I do not know...
- React, and the right?

139
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,300
- How do you find?
- Leave, I find myself.

140
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:47,400
Skinny's nephew died of Faddeev
injuries in less than a week.

141
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,500
I saw that fight.

142
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,600
I saw Anton The Pro.
At that mãscãriciul finished.

143
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:01,300
It sounds good to me, but I bet that was
the last time you saw anything like this.

144
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:07,800
- Why the hell are you laughing?
- No answer. Faddeev?

145
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:13,300
Skinny Faddeev ruining his career
a heavyweight boxer,

146
00:17:13,335 --> 00:17:18,300
i, and let be killed and his nephew lost
30 million.

147
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:27,200
And another thing. Do everything without announce
Mafia in Las Vegas about the deception.

148
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,100
Instead, and assume responsibility for
Is this colossal disaster

149
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,500
and try to make peace
the boys in Vegas.

150
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,300
Skinny decide to adjust scores
The Pro Protopov Anton.

151
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:48,100
Three days later, they found the Skinny
Prostranstva the kitchen.

152
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,100
It was hard to make the difference between
former employer and boron and.

153
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,700
It's the same blood mixed with boron and
Skinny's Faddeev,

154
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:06,500
that you and I seek, I have found
Protopov's dirty laundry.

155
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,100
Coming down the hall.

156
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,300
- Wait, you bastard!
- Allow the bottle down!

157
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,900
Hands up!

158
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,200
- Eraþi there, I will have him arrested.
- Yes, we were.

159
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
So what? Do not wait and on.

160
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,400
How does this relate to finding
a dancer?

161
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,500
What does a broken condom
with your birth certificate, Poley?

162
00:18:42,535 --> 00:18:44,500
It's cause and effect.

163
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,700
By the way, I'm gonna be sick.

164
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,400
And Skeres and I pretend
I do not see that.

165
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,200
Skeres and I, and I Skeres
we pretend that we do not see.

166
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,800
You think you're better than me, no, Cruz?

167
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:06,500
We are workers, some immigrants Facebook
fãgãduinþei in this country, no hairdresser?

168
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,700
But I'm the one who has the badge.
Please for the last time

169
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,300
tell us what you do, everything you know
until now.

170
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,100
And if not? Poley strikes me?
I might regain his sight.

171
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,500
I'll do anything to help you.

172
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,100
As soon as we say,
exit much faster here.

173
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,900
No, I do not care. Tell me if
it's good, if it's alive.

174
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,100
You first.

175
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,500
Agreed.

176
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:42,600
The Pro Anton was sentenced life
Skinny Faddeev for his murder.

177
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:49,200
Suddenly, after five years without releasing
conditioned, is released. Free.

178
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,900
Someone else has confessed the crime.

179
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,400
A Vegas thug who had already
300 years

180
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,000
for murder, rape, kidnapping.
He claimed that he killed the Faddeev.

181
00:20:00,035 --> 00:20:03,400
Because I had not Faddeev
to arrange a match in Vegas.

182
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,300
He sustains that was staged by Anton
blood and everything and boron.

183
00:20:08,335 --> 00:20:09,300
So what?

184
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,400
So what? You really think so?

185
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,700
Enough with the mafia. Skip to the girl.

186
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,800
If you do not you understand the point of view
Mafia don

187
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,100
then you will not understand anything
to reach the diamonds.

188
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,100
What diamonds?

189
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Where was I?

190
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:43,000
A life sentenced to 2 m and 136 kg
released from prison and looking all

191
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,000
his girlfriend. Not so it's a romantic?

192
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,700
Cut. I filmed. Who's next?

193
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,900
So you gave today raided my club?

194
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,200
- You heard, right?
- Yeah, right. How did you find me?

195
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,400
- We've been looking in the right place.
- Trouble with the candle you doing?

196
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,100
The fact that your legal name is Puss
was a surprise.

197
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,500
Then came the name of your house
Production

198
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:16,500
and here I am... in a warehouse
on an artist at work.

199
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:22,000
- I never saw this cãþeaua.
- Fair enough.

200
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,900
Herman Minkowski died four years ago.
You bought the building a year later.

201
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:34,100
- Who would you get it sold?
- Widow's. Dancer and actress.

202
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,100
Harder, for God!

203
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,100
What's up?

204
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,900
And one that puts an ever-changing
another.

205
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,300
The conclusion is that all are created equal.

206
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,500
Only not know where that disappear.

207
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,300
Between... and not ever leave.

208
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,700
Stop!

209
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:04,600
- Minkowski's widow has no name?
- Zooey Wigner.

210
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:11,400
- Appears in the movie and you?
- And he appeared in Hitchcock's.

211
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:22,600
Lights. Camera. Filmaþi, fucks!

212
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,700
It took me about 30 minutes to find it
Zooey on the Internet.

213
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:40,000
Susþii that when you saw
Puss last time?

214
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,700
Yes.

215
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,700
You'd be surprised.

216
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,200
Puss morning that the day was still there.

217
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,500
And why be surprised?

218
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:57,900
If you had not, it means you've broken and
fucking back.

219
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,300
A well-arranged black.

220
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,300
Was needed and solidly bãtãu
to make such damages.

221
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,400
What the hell you are talking?

222
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,500
Zooey Wigner.
Story and us about it.

223
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,800
I found it to any of the agents.

224
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,600
And it's not listed as client
any manager.

225
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,800
I found it on a Web page
UCLA Medical Center.

226
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,200
Her drug dependence
profits went through

227
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,100
won by her late husband
the striptease club.

228
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:51,400
Her only talent is acting
to behave like a sick patient

229
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,900
that BC residents and test the
medical talents.

230
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,700
Friday suffering from autophagy.

231
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,300
Disease that causes people to eat-and
of your body

232
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,100
for sexual stimulation.

233
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,300
Fucking job.

234
00:24:06,335 --> 00:24:11,000
But... my recovery clinic pays...

235
00:24:11,035 --> 00:24:15,900
... and an apartment in El Segundo.

236
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Take a look at this.

237
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:31,100
It looks like a girl who worked at the club
some time ago.

238
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,500
You remember her name?

239
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,700
No... that's not the problem.

240
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,600
I do not remember too much...
at that time.

241
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:54,200
Take them. You're the actress. Professional.
Your time is valuable. Significant.

242
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:00,800
Significant? I pretend
that I eat alone.

243
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,900
What is the significance here?

244
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,700
Wait. Maybe Jules...

245
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,100
Or just Julie... I think.

246
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:32,300
Ouroboros. Plato described it as
first living creature in the universe.

247
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,800
A timeless and perfect creature.

248
00:25:35,835 --> 00:25:39,500
A snake which its own tail and swallow.

249
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,800
Everything has significance.

250
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,700
Nice. I bet you did a
to feel better.

251
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,700
I suppose that you were in the apartment
Zooey Wigner's that night?

252
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,400
No. What surprise me this time?

253
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,100
Yesterday, Zooey Wigner was found

254
00:26:03,135 --> 00:26:08,100
floating face-up
in her apartment in the basement.

255
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,000
- Floating?
- Someone let the water flow in the tub.

256
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,500
But you've never been there
and suppose that Anton.

257
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,900
No. I was at Kepler.

258
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,900
- What învârþi? You seem torn down.
- I'm fine.

259
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,300
Kill me when you see how you suffer.

260
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:52,000
I'm thinking I do tele evangelist.
It's a booming business.

261
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:57,000
What's the time?

262
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,400
I'm looking for someone who is presumed to exist
but nobody saw it.

263
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,300
And that?

264
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:10,300
Always you doing person
disappeared, the other outside.

265
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,600
- The soul mate.
- It's not about me here.

266
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,900
- How to not...
- It's for a client.

267
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,600
It's a task.

268
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,800
Is anyone after me. It may be customer
or else.

269
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:29,100
- Are you thinking about serious things?
- Nothing serious, someone signs on the skin.

270
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,700
I'm gonna be interested. But remember you thi...

271
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,900
Love sees not with eyes,
but with the mind.

272
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,800
Cupid is blind.

273
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,900
- What are you talking?
- Love...

274
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,900
You knew what was going to happen.
Always knows.

275
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,900
And do that thing. Cruz,
What the hell are you talking about?

276
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,000
- Jazz.
- What is it?

277
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:11,900
Sex, a heartbeat and soul.

278
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:17,100
- Skeres, you're married, right?
- Divorced.

279
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,800
May Îþi remember your love, right?

280
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,500
I have kids in college and Alimony
payable.

281
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,800
- I did for love stories.
- Sorry.

282
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,200
Close your eyes...

283
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,200
and I'll show you my secrets.

284
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,400
Can you love me and you without shame
or fear.

285
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,900
I am a missing person
in your heart.

286
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:34,500
Your only true love.

287
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:01,800
Anton was right. No one stood
at that address.

288
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:06,000
Wherever he would write, Lexie Persimmon
hiding.

289
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,200
Excuse me. Mrs... Mrs...

290
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,100
Just a moment.

291
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,700
Until recently, these letters came
the place is vacant.

292
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:02,400
They were sent by someone through the mail,
someone who had signed for them.

293
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,000
And?

294
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,400
Are American linden postal employee.
Do not take bribes.

295
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:17,300
No, no, not making money, but please, help me.

296
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:22,000
We need to address. It is very important.

297
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,700
Ask the San Celeritas.

298
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:31,900
- Where?
- San Celeritas, New Mexico.

299
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,100
Thanks.

300
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:49,600
I returned to the office for some
shirts and clean underwear someone.

301
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:55,700
Then I realized that no client
follow me and my Facebook.

302
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,600
The Pro Anton had no reason
rãscoleascã to my office.

303
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:08,700
You have to be traced one
when he first came to me.

304
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,900
He had a bag when he came, but not the time
left. Or want to know what is there...

305
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,200
... Or know about letters
and where they find.

306
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,700
- Really? Why?
- I did not know, Poley.

307
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,000
I had time to read them all.

308
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,200
San Celeritas, New Mexico, is a city
left in an area under development.

309
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,900
Anton and dancer that...
She did not know...

310
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,600
... But he wrote?

311
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,100
What idioþenie! As listen
shit?

312
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,300
I do not know. Space and time
are relative, Poley.

313
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,300
Time slows down
if you reach the speed of light.

314
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,500
Things are getting smaller, more dense.

315
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,900
The faster you travel and,
the smaller and more insignificant you are.

316
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,400
- Oh... what fun...
- Are only the laws of physics, Poley.

317
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:16,400
You know what you? I think the wait.

318
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,800
Tepþii abhorrent and even more
than on the hard.

319
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,400
You're one of them and you, right?

320
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,800
Stay on topic.

321
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:35,000
I know you play with us. -Thi recalls,
to tell you can read thoughts.

322
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,700
You could read it to you
in a book with illustrations.

323
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,500
What did you say?

324
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,000
I know you're love to me.
But listen here...

325
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,500
If I do bad, if I do something
irretrievably.

326
00:33:49,535 --> 00:33:53,000
You never know where the diamonds!

327
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,300
What diamonds?

328
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,400
They are on their way to New Mexico...

329
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,400
Lexie is like and if I found
San Celeritas,

330
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,200
instead of which have been sent
letters.

331
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:31,500
We decided to drive, clear my mind
to think about whether giving up on this job...

332
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,600
and ez to me to my house somewhere...

333
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,000
I keep wondering why Faddeev Skinny

334
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:48,600
would be paid 30 million Anton
in advance.

335
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,600
And where is the money?

336
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,400
And what a dancer, which represents
dream of any man, choose to hook up

337
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:05,100
the worst nightmare of Darwin?

338
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,700
I was thinking her one.

339
00:35:13,735 --> 00:35:15,400
Woman picture...

340
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,400
I say that if they find
Lexie on Persimmon,

341
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,500
if that's her real name,

342
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,000
I say that one searches for King Kong...

343
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,900
... And this will be the end.

344
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,700
But I thought.

345
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,200
Not even a minute.

346
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:04,300
- Your place is not here.
- So... where?

347
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:09,700
Besides people like them... red aura,
substantial, solid...

348
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:16,000
blue and evlavio and i...
mostly yellow.

349
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,200
Intellectuals.

350
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:23,000
Your aura is gray. You're full of contradictions.

351
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,900
But you have a vibration and red like crimson.

352
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:32,400
It is extremely rare on this earth,
but... there's something dark about you.

353
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:41,000
- There's more to visit here?
- No!

354
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:46,300
An old air base closed in 1962.

355
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,000
Here we were testing the V2 rockets
nemþi captured.

356
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,700
- Then he bought a Kestral...
- Simon Kestral?

357
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,500
Yes. Isolated and visionary billionaire
Simon Kestral.

358
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,300
No one has ever seen.

359
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:06,400
But he bought San Celeritas
and whatever is underneath.

360
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,700
There are some tunnels that you say
that lead to sweet,

361
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,900
where you think it's a military base
filled with aliens and secret underground tri.

362
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,800
But you do not believe that's the and a.

363
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:26,400
No. And you can not go there.
Because of the collision.

364
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:31,900
- Collision?
- Particles collide with each other.

365
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,800
Sorry, you breakfast?

366
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,500
Where will I find?

367
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,500
I do not know, man. And I just
that your place is not here.

368
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,400
A recognize you?

369
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,500
- Can you take the sauce?
- Sure.

370
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,900
Sorry.

371
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,200
Know the A, sir?

372
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:08,800
E of Sikhism. He said
that God is real and eternal.

373
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,600
Very cool.

374
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:20,200
- Yours is the building?
- No, I just work here.

375
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:26,800
- Who is the chief postal lime?
- He who owns the place.

376
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:33,400
Orders are ready. I have to go.

377
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,700
When you finish work?

378
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:40,900
About 14 minutes after I start to put it.

379
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,200
What are these?

380
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,300
Screw traces left by particles
subatomic

381
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,500
that move the liquid hydrogen
a magnetic field.

382
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,500
I have seemed familiar.

383
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,600
You must understand that everything behaves

384
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:12,500
nebãgatã into account that a particle
until something is observed.

385
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:19,000
Multiple simultaneous states of reality.

386
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,100
When you see something, anywhere
in the universe, to change.

387
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:31,500
And if that work is involved
in a relationship with something else, and he changes.

388
00:40:31,535 --> 00:40:33,100
At the same time.

389
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,400
And it's faster than light.

390
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,200
Nothing is faster than light.

391
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:51,600
Release magic...

392
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,700
... And atom.

393
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:05,300
It's made of electrons, protons and neutrons.

394
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,800
Protons and neutrons
are alcãtuiþi of quarks,

395
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,100
which are united by the gluon.

396
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:15,100
Gluons are bosons, and bosons
elementary particles are

397
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:20,400
which is the fundamental forces
of nature.

398
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,500
You're here for...

399
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,300
Because... in two days
90 m underground,

400
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:43,400
two beams of protons
will face each other at lightning speed.

401
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,600
Nothing is faster.

402
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:51,900
And you may find it right here
and in the middle of desert.

403
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,900
- What's your finds?
- Apogee. Particle divine.

404
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,400
And you are here...

405
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:16,200
I'm looking for someone who is presumed to exist
but nobody saw it.

406
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,900
And in the middle of desert.

407
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,700
I aims to someone, but do not know who.

408
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,900
Really?

409
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,500
How the service works Zip?

410
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,200
Mail? Not working.

411
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,100
People use Priority Mail
or electronic.

412
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,700
Mail goes into a normal drum.

413
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,000
People come and take what is theirs.

414
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:58,300
When I say everything I know.

415
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:04,600
About 260 letters
about lonely dancer

416
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,800
and former boxer who became obsessed.

417
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,800
A beautiful woman who found a way

418
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:16,000
and to share their deepest passions
without fear of consequences.

419
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:22,100
Because I chose to give love and
a man who never gets out of prison.

420
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,900
Until... out of nowhere...

421
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,100
... To exit it.

422
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,600
But until that time...

423
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,600
... Boxer has been informed.

424
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,300
Nonsense!

425
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:59,500
Sorry, Poley. The Pro Anton
Do not expect to seeing daylight.

426
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,400
So she told her
which finds diamonds.

427
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,600
- Yes, diamonds...
- Right.

428
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Lexie is not waiting for Persimmon.

429
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,800
The Pro Protopov like Anton to come
seek it.

430
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,300
You must be very, very specific.
Do not have much time.

431
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,700
- Why?
- For that morning is coming soon.

432
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
And if you want to explain to local policemen and
how did everything...

433
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:29,200
- You need every detail.
- Every fucking detail.

434
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,100
Tic tac, tic tac...

435
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,700
Why did you decide to discussion
However the waitress?

436
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,500
We need your name and password cafe
for Arbitrum Inc..

437
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:51,400
<i>Every week take Lexie Persimmon
envelope of the drum from Planck's Constant</i>

438
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:55,500
<i>you send us a sealed envelope
by Priority Mail.</i>

439
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,500
<i>Since Fay has never met
Lexie on Persimmon,</i>

440
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,600
<i>it probably came after the program.</i>

441
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,600
<i>The only witness to this event
week was a digital camera</i>

442
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,900
<i>from ATM's at Arbitrum.</i>

443
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:15,400
Why the hell was important to see and the
her letters?

444
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,400
Because I started to wonder if.

445
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,400
Persimmon Lexie even existed...

446
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,400
beyond imagination.

447
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,700
Simon Kestral surfing
and smoking grass on the beach in Tahiti Papara.

448
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,400
He had an idea.

449
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:08,100
Why revoluþionat
microchip technology.

450
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:12,700
At the age of 60 years,
12th century is rich and the world...

451
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,100
and is totally alone.

452
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,100
Damn!

453
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,000
The hell, man.

454
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,200
Ã knew guys are sick.

455
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,100
I work for one of the largest firms
security in the country.

456
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,900
Sustain the government and the private sector.
Why?

457
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:44,700
Because they see self defense and protection
neapãraþi of a debt of honor.

458
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,700
Take it literally.

459
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:53,100
I asked them to bring me up to see us
and you brought me to see.

460
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,000
I'm Simon Kestral.

461
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,000
Since this does not give you hand
because, the way it tabloids say,

462
00:47:59,035 --> 00:48:02,200
am and the strange
people that do not reach other instant.

463
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,500
But not only have a bunch of lies.

464
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,600
Come on.

465
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,900
I'm sorry you're here without a jacket.

466
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,900
But you were little...

467
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,500
What the hell, Jack?

468
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,500
Ez Revan and I'll face you.

469
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,900
You can start right now.

470
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,900
No.

471
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,000
You're in a circular tunnel
13 km

472
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,000
90 meters in San Celeritas.

473
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,600
Over 27 hours

474
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,400
8 magnets producing
10 mega joules of energy

475
00:48:56,435 --> 00:48:59,900
will guide two beams of protons
which will be held simultaneously.

476
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,500
Is going round at each other

477
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,800
at 99.999% the speed of light

478
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,000
and will face right there.

479
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:14,400
We will recreate conditions
3 tenths of a second after the Big Bang.

480
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,600
Beginning of the universe...

481
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,600
13 billion years ago.

482
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,000
Have questions?

483
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,900
Some good.

484
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:30,400
Why is my hell you're interested?
You know he'll tell me. Because you're not residents.

485
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,700
Over 27 hours I'll find something
that there should be theoretically.

486
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,100
- But nobody has seen.
- Funny. This is exactly what I was doing.

487
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,100
You know why?

488
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,800
Yes, they're a private detective
and I was hired to find out.

489
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,700
Because I already know why we are here.
We knew from the beginning.

490
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,200
Really?
Who was the last time?

491
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:55,300
We are sensitive creatures
involved in an infinite universe.

492
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,400
And infinite extrapolation
of our evolution

493
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:02,500
will make us to become gods.
You understand?

494
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:07,200
After all, we need to know the secret

495
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:09,800
his magic wand.

496
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,800
If something divine in all bodies

497
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,400
of all galaxies,
in the universe is expanding,

498
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:31,200
if you and I were smaller
than a single atom,

499
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,400
where it came from all over this table?

500
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,500
Do not tell me.
Particle divine.

501
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,400
10 with congratulations.

502
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:42,800
Tomorrow morning at 7:00,
technology worth 5 billion

503
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,300
I will answer the big question
of all time.

504
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,000
- Why do men have nipples?
- You're a philistine.

505
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:56,300
The reason we are here
is to find out how we got here.

506
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,500
What's the trick,

507
00:50:57,535 --> 00:51:02,200
which is divine mechanism
that gives form and substance to everything.

508
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,800
Any other questions
a waste of time.

509
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:12,200
That's the only thing worth pursuing
in the universe... brother.

510
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:18,600
- Looking for a woman.
- Îþi lives your life in vain, Ombre.

511
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:22,400
To live in the city of my hours in advance

512
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:25,800
making significant questions
about a person,

513
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,100
- What's the point?
- Love.

514
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,700
I went to him.

515
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,100
I have received from the chief's security

516
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,700
an invitation to dinner, that evening,
home to Kestral.

517
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:54,000
He told me he's someone who wants
to know him.

518
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,500
I needed sleep.

519
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,800
We need your name and password
from the ATM digital camera.

520
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,300
But I could not abþine.

521
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:09,900
I had a bag full of thoughts
a beautiful woman

522
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,900
and hidden desires with someone.

523
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:21,500
<i>I'm the one you're dreaming,
when bãieþelul became man.</i>

524
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:25,400
<i>I was made for you...
and only for you.</i>

525
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:30,800
<i>We amestecaþi, you and me,
in our own universe.</i>

526
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,100
Yours forever, Lexie.

527
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,900
<i>PS I did as you asked.</i>

528
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:43,100
<i>They were exactly where you told me that they will be.</i>

529
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:47,500
<i>In their vault in the ground,
where they belong.</i>

530
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:51,000
Because I do not need
The bogaþii materials.

531
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,300
- I got you...
- For the rest of life.

532
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:00,500
- Where is It?
- How the hell did you get here.

533
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,700
You found it? What are you doing here?
He's with you?

534
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Shut tract for a moment.

535
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,500
- Did you follow.
- I know that.

536
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,100
What is this place?

537
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,100
The land that makes you think.

538
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,900
Stay here and you will be mayor.

539
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:20,400
- What the hell is this... what the hell is that?
- You know what e.

540
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:25,300
No.
Where did you say that will be?

541
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:28,100
- In the ice.
- What?

542
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,300
Wooden box
that gave me a Skinny.

543
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,500
What Diamond, hairdresser?

544
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,400
Those diamonds.

545
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:40,100
Skinny Faddeev which gave them
The Pro as Anton's price to drop.

546
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:44,300
- Wait, u and resin...
- No, do not fool Poley, do not.

547
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,000
Anthony believed that there will never exit
prison

548
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:51,300
and was in love with his girlfriend
the correspondence.

549
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,300
So he told him where he finds the girl.

550
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,700
- A and E.
- Where?

551
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,800
- In the closet.
- In the closet?

552
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,900
Anton's room
the Hotel Roosevelt.

553
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,800
Conflict diamonds worth
30 million dollars

554
00:54:16,835 --> 00:54:19,400
were hidden in the chandelier from the ceiling.

555
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,200
Conflict?

556
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,700
You know...
always worried me,

557
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:31,500
why he paid his attorney Anton
in advance, as to throw the evidence?

558
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:36,000
But if the attorney believed that Faddeev
something that is hard to sell the free market,

559
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,900
Diamond couple of hands
of unknown origin

560
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,700
Anton and would be realized, but...

561
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:46,500
Faddeev they still wanted them back.

562
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:51,500
Especially after killing his nephew Anton
and confused fighting.

563
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,300
Think you're too much.

564
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,600
Compared with you, Poley,
and to make and asparagus.

565
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,200
This is my favorite vegetable.

566
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,100
- Damn!
- Stops you!

567
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,900
Stops you!

568
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:12,800
What is it,
What the hell do not you understand?

569
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:17,300
- No need to touch me.
- Do not touch.

570
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:23,400
Bravo, so violent.

571
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:30,200
I need diamonds.
Where the diamonds now?

572
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,600
Back on earth, where is this place?

573
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,800
- What does that mean?
- She hid them?

574
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:39,400
Yes, yes, yes.
And reach it.

575
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:45,200
First, I had to explain Anton

576
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,500
I found that her Lexie Persimmon.

577
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:52,600
Then I had to find
if you know...

578
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,900
Who is my city.

579
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,500
Maybe Baratva. Mafia.

580
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,800
I have chased me,
now you're watching you.

581
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,200
Why would I track the Mafia?

582
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:14,600
I think about it.
I think þinând account of ice.

583
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:21,200
- Diamonds? Why?
- Because I killed him Skinny for them.

584
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:27,100
- So he did.
- Yes.

585
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,900
Q and jewelry will back
after I gave in the bar.

586
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,500
I wanted to kill his nephew.

587
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:39,100
I feel bad.
But the Skinny...

588
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,200
I stood in his way.

589
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,900
No I did not want him to kill him.

590
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:52,500
But I did it.
Sometimes... I do not know... but...

591
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,600
I had to. I know.

592
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,900
When you and another convicted confesses
Skinny that killed Faddeev,

593
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,100
are confused

594
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,400
because I know that I am the one
who did it.

595
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:11,200
But now I think Mafia
I wanted out of jail

596
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:15,100
as to lead them to diamond.

597
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:18,200
Anton... you're a genius.

598
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:25,100
Now we have to protect my Lexie.

599
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,600
First you need to find her.

600
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,400
It has diamonds.

601
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,800
And you... if one finds you,

602
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
will not only lead them to it.

603
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:47,100
It was late when I received phone
from Fay

604
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:51,200
and I accessed the site Arbitrum ATM.

605
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,100
I started looking in the ATM records

606
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,300
after a model.

607
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:04,000
Someone receiving a letter
and by sending it via Priority Mail.

608
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,900
Lexie has ceased to write Persimmon
8 weeks ago.

609
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:11,600
The so that only the first 4 weeks
of the 12 available on the server

610
00:58:11,635 --> 00:58:13,000
were relevant.

611
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:18,900
At any time dubiþa security
would stop and take me to dinner.

612
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,800
And then I understood.

613
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:30,000
Suddenly, my quest to end.
I found who I was looking for.

614
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:35,200
Detective, I'd like you to know
on my wife.

615
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:41,000
Julie... ã acquainted with Ned Cruz.

616
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,600
A real private detective.

617
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:52,000
This honest man and devoted existence
on earth

618
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:56,200
to imply that the lives researched
the people of others.

619
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:01,700
- Hello.
- Hello.

620
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,700
It's a Remorse.
A town to fish and parasite.

621
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:09,400
The attached shows one of belly fat
the great city,

622
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,500
Eating iþele left and its parasite.

623
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:18,600
E of Los Angeles
his distinguished career house scene.

624
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:22,000
It's an artifact from your past

625
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,400
San Celeritas up.

626
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:29,800
I'm glad you Russians holders.
It will be fun.

627
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:34,800
- You're a parasite on and you, Mr. Cruz?
- No.

628
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:38,400
So why do it to my husband and the
to say such ugly things?

629
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:41,100
Well... they are just words.

630
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:44,000
Words are important to you?

631
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,800
When you hurt.

632
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:50,200
That's fucking deep.

633
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:55,200
Detach shows up, Detective.

634
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,200
Niels Drula geckos.

635
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:05,400
PhD from MIT at age 13.

636
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:08,600
At age 16 he finished school.

637
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:14,000
Professor of theoretical physics department
University of Geneva in 20 years.

638
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:20,400
Chief Physicist at the particle accelerator
The San Celeritas.

639
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:27,400
It's cursed by a neurological disease.

640
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:32,000
He sees numbers as shapes and words
and color.

641
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:36,900
Is called synesthesia.
Psyche bored objects.

642
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:41,300
A and the inner life that is
very rich.

643
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,600
I envy above all else.

644
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:52,000
Îþi will give a lecture.

645
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:57,000
- Niels? Let's eat.
- Okay.

646
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:10,000
Once I thought that we live in his universe
governed by Newtonian mechanics.

647
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,500
Cause and effect.

648
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:14,700
Newton was elegant, yes,
but certain principles have emerged

649
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,200
and everything changed.

650
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,700
The electron can be two different things
in two different places

651
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:24,700
at the same time, so be
Cause and effect e... ridiculous.

652
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,300
You can not predict, with some security,

653
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,700
what will happen to happen.

654
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,700
Talk to me divine particle.

655
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:42,900
When the universe was created...

656
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,100
Thanks.

657
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,500
It was an equal amount of matter
and antimatter

658
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:53,300
and should have annihilated each other
leaving only an empty space.

659
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,900
That does not explain how the universe is
as mass.

660
01:01:57,100 --> 01:02:02,200
There is no explanation why we are here
in the physical sense.

661
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:06,200
Instead, unless there

662
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:10,600
a special particle, mysterious

663
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:14,900
which actually gives mass...
all things.

664
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,000
In a sense, these particles
must exist

665
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,200
but I've never seen.

666
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:24,000
It's like love.
You know that there

667
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,200
one can feel,
but I never saw her.

668
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:32,000
What happens tomorrow?

669
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:37,400
We recreate the existing conditions
a tenth of a second after the Big Bang.

670
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,200
Protons will collide at the speed of light.

671
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:47,300
Quarks and gluons will release their
enough energy to create.

672
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:51,600
Higgs boson particle's,
divine particle.

673
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,600
It is unstable and fragile.

674
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:59,500
It will take less than a millionth
of a billionth

675
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,900
of a billionth, of a second...

676
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:03,800
if needed.

677
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:08,200
But we'll see for the first time
in history.

678
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,000
Questions?

679
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:16,800
Yes.
The woman who serves us, it's Indian...

680
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:22,000
is dressed in white, is hurt.
Why?

681
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:26,600
Is called Prabha and her husband
died down there.

682
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:32,800
- There have been many accidents.
- A former engineer and made a mistake.

683
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:37,800
- There have been many mistakes.
- More? Compared to what?

684
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:42,700
- He got caught.
- Þintuit as something larger than himself.

685
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,300
- He broke the rib cage.
- Yes. He broke my heart.

686
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,600
It was his fucking fault.

687
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,000
- Blame him?
- You can bet,

688
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,800
Because the only error
are human.

689
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:59,500
We make wrong choices knives.
Unfortunately we have no time to regret them.

690
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:04,500
Unlike my wife too lonely.

691
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,700
He made some wrong choices you ite
long ago.

692
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,300
Please...

693
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:16,700
That's why you're here. Do not you?

694
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:21,200
Let me guess.
A man searches.

695
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,600
Maybe I'm just me.

696
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:31,700
What's the worst thing that can be
happen for several billion technology.

697
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:36,200
If there is human error
here in Mexico?

698
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,300
- A black hole.
- What?

699
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:39,900
A black hole.

700
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,500
Theoretically, the impact of so much energy

701
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,400
could create a black hole
you can swallow the earth

702
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:51,000
or perhaps create ciudãþenii
I can start merging

703
01:04:51,035 --> 01:04:54,600
and to transform our planet
snowball into a small area.

704
01:04:54,635 --> 01:04:56,800
We do what we fear.

705
01:04:57,100 --> 01:05:01,200
You came here in the penultimate moment.

706
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:05,900
Ultimate spiritual quest.

707
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:09,200
Because God is the Wizard of Oz.

708
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,800
He's the man behind the curtain.

709
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,400
And tomorrow... I'll be behind the scenes.

710
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:24,000
You should store my things
and to leave

711
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,100
a small ball of shit
the prenatal position, because...

712
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,800
as far as her look,

713
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:34,000
it is inconsistent in comparison with what
will happen tomorrow when you press the button.

714
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:39,300
The idea is that you're a jerk slightly.

715
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:44,500
Your coming here, trying to muddy shit
about me

716
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,500
is a cosmic mess.

717
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,500
You fucked.
You're at the show of magic.

718
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:52,300
Who can not live without you know
As did the trick.

719
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,200
All you'll do
is to ruin the rest of us.

720
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:05,300
I think you two need to go.

721
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:09,400
Do what you do.

722
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:14,500
Speak... do amor,
does not matter.

723
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,200
Tomorrow morning I'll be on stage 7

724
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,400
with God...

725
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,200
directly linked to what appears on the pipe.

726
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:45,700
What do you think will happen tomorrow morning
7:00?

727
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:52,400
There are some hidden variables,
so be it is difficult to predict the outcome.

728
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:58,100
But I think in one way or another,
Tomorrow at 7:00,

729
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:01,600
Kestral Simon will be close to God.

730
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:11,000
Geckos went home and Kestral
descended from the accelerator

731
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:15,800
to do whatever the hell to do,
8 hours before the show.

732
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,900
Julie and me...

733
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:24,800
I went for a walk.

734
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,600
You really came here for me?

735
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,800
Yes... yes.

736
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,500
- I am what are you doing?
- Yes.

737
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:50,600
How do you know?

738
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:55,200
You're exactly what you want.

739
01:07:56,900 --> 01:08:01,200
How do I know that others are not you men
I knew that?

740
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:05,400
You looking at me because I want to see.

741
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:11,000
You must stop defining myself
as having many men who see me.

742
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:17,600
- You father complex, the so-i?
- Yes.

743
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:26,800
- My clothes off for him, if you're interested.
- Is your husband.

744
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:32,600
You know, it's about the same thing.
For him and not just a metaphor.

745
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:37,000
As a trophy or a symbol that you seek,
always looking for something.

746
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:38,700
What?

747
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:44,000
You know... you know... inside.

748
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:50,200
We sit on top of him. Right now.

749
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,600
Accelerator.

750
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,600
Here the particles collide.
It's crazy.

751
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:00,200
I'll blow up everything in front.

752
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:03,000
You know... a big problem here.

753
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,500
Kiss me.

754
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:14,700
No. Not yet.
Listen. It's here.

755
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:20,000
- Who?
- Anton The Pro's here. Protopov.

756
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:23,900
- What?
- Oh... Okay, listen.

757
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,100
You can help.

758
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:29,500
But you must be honest.
Has been going on?

759
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:33,200
You did it because you were single?
I've written for the paper he wrote

760
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:36,400
about a boxer that was
to, and spend the rest of life in prison?

761
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:39,300
It may be worth several million dollars.

762
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,500
Wait, do not know what you talking.

763
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:45,100
Mean 30 million dollars
life in high style with which you have the usual.

764
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:48,100
Stops you, and you confuse me.

765
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,200
Where did you get that?

766
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:01,400
We buried it all.

767
01:10:01,435 --> 01:10:02,500
Did you flush?

768
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:06,200
My pictures, all things in the past
I'm right here.

769
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:10,400
Listen, what you say makes sense.
Why have this complex?

770
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,200
Why do geckos?

771
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,100
No, not deny.

772
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:17,200
I have seen, was recorded
coffee shop.

773
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:21,500
Why did you use to raise Niels geckos
Mail and send letters to tell you?

774
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,000
What letter?

775
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:28,200
Let me see.
Who is Lexie Persimmon?

776
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,100
Jeez.

777
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:46,000
- Lexie!
- Shit!

778
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:58,300
- What the hell is that?
- Do not know?

779
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,700
- Come on. Gotta run.
- Where?

780
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,500
There. Get out there. Now!

781
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:15,600
Anton, wait! Listen to me!
It's not her. It's not Lexie Persimmon!

782
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:19,900
I can not stop.
You want to fight, tough guy? That shot me.

783
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:24,300
I can not. You're my client.

784
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:26,900
Lexie!

785
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,500
How cliché. Come on.

786
01:11:58,500 --> 01:11:59,800
It's open.

787
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,000
What the hell is happening?

788
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:07,500
- Where are we?
- Niels E's house.

789
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:10,100
It's geckos? Wait a little.
Who knows.

790
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:13,100
Minkowski that you danced to?
Who would take your picture?

791
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:16,700
- He should have.
- Geckos was a striptease club?

792
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:21,600
Yes. He brought in one night my husband.
Niels made us acquainted.

793
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:24,300
Shit!

794
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,300
Lexie!

795
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:29,200
Who's this?

796
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:31,200
A guy who believes
you're the woman of his dreams.

797
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:32,700
What?

798
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:35,800
- Okay, let's go.
- Lexie!

799
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:42,300
Niels?

800
01:12:56,700 --> 01:13:00,300
Lex Parsimoniae?
What does that mean?

801
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:05,600
The Latin phrase
a philosophical concept,

802
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:08,700
known as Occam's razor.

803
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:12,800
In a language that Poley
one can understand,

804
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:18,700
means... "All things being equal."

805
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:21,800
The most simple solution, is the best.

806
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:27,000
If this means
that a lone physicist

807
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:31,900
began a sexual relationship for five years
by correspondence

808
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:35,000
the life of a convicted murderer
to prison.

809
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,000
... It was safe, perfect.

810
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:43,200
Murderer receives love
and physicist receives treatment.

811
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:46,000
Women who consider themselves to be.

812
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:50,200
At night, in the privacy of his home,

813
01:13:50,235 --> 01:13:54,700
strikes hidden
without fear of being discovered.

814
01:13:56,100 --> 01:14:01,000
This means that Niels geckos.

815
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:05,300
Lex's Parsimoniae.

816
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:10,800
Persimmon Lexie.

817
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:15,800
- You wrote letters, yes?
- What letter?

818
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:19,800
- Did you... did you read?
- Yes.

819
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,000
Do not understand.

820
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:33,500
God...
And that comes after you cut.

821
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:38,000
Need to know. In his last letter
must be said to tell you that out, huh?

822
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:41,000
Yes.
Of course we have calculated the possibility that

823
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,900
and I realized that would come after me.

824
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:46,900
Wait a little.
What?

825
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,500
I did something wrong?

826
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:54,700
Where are the diamonds?

827
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,100
Lexie!

828
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:03,100
Come here, come here.
Do not make noise.

829
01:15:09,100 --> 01:15:11,800
Well, Anton! Enough!

830
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,300
Hi Anton.

831
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:23,400
Niels geckos calculated the probability
as Anton Protopov to find it.

832
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:25,500
Lexie?

833
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:30,200
Based on its results
and he bought a gun.

834
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:42,100
- Do not look like you.
- Yes.

835
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:53,200
Lexie're not mine.
You're the man.

836
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,200
They are both at the same time.

837
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:07,900
Please... please put the gun down.

838
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:13,900
- I can love.
- What? No! Where is she?

839
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:15,500
- I'm here.
- No!

840
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:18,500
- I'm here.
- Wait!

841
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:23,000
No! Stops you!

842
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:28,100
I love you.

843
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:30,800
Drop your weapon!

844
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:44,400
That's all I remember.

845
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:49,600
Until I came and I could see something
and I have emerged.

846
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:54,000
I do not know who is alive or dead.

847
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:57,800
All I want... all you need to know,

848
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:03,000
if Julia is good.
That's it.

849
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Bravo.

850
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:12,000
One more thing.

851
01:17:12,035 --> 01:17:15,400
Who was.
Who broke the party.

852
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:18,000
This... this is simple.

853
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:24,100
The guy who watched him Anton
and then told me,

854

855
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:35,700

and has not finished primary school
because I did not like.

857
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:44,600
The other is a family ruined

858
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:48,100
who has not achieved anything in life.

859
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,600
The third type

860
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:55,800
wearing brown shoes and a black suit

861
01:17:55,835 --> 01:17:59,700
it can not distinguish
between good and evil.

862
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:04,400
How the hell can you describe it
if you have not seen?

863
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,400
You're right, Poley, but you know something?

864
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:11,000
There had to see him to admit that
Hairdressers loþiunea's unfortunate.

865
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:21,800
Nobody knew better story

- Bad boys!
- Bad boys.

871
01:18:35,835 --> 01:18:39,000
You know, Anthony was right.

872
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:43,000
He was released from prison
by Mafia

873
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,900

That's funny.

880
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:17,800
Anton does not care about diamonds.

881
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:23,000
On my advice, he hid.

882
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:31,000
Poley... well.

883
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:52,900
- Get up.
- Lift, Poley.

884
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:56,600
- Pick it yourself.
- Do not have time.

885
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:00,500
Lift it.

886
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:20,800
This one is fucking end.
Do not know where the diamonds.

887
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:22,900
Poley killed each other.

888
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:24,900
- Shut the fuck up.
- Fuck you, Poley!

889
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,300

890
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:28,700
Who the hell gave the bar here?

01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:37,800
- Your client.
- Why?

894
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,800
You followed the so-called your survey.

895
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:44,000
He did not like
African-American personality.

896
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:49,200
What about Zooey Wigner?
Anthony had no where to know where she lives.

897
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,400
You... bastards.

898
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:58,100
You have pursued me from the medical center.

- Yes.
- Shit...

905
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:28,100
However, you can not clean this mess.

906
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:31,800
There are too many dead ends.
It's misery, misery.

907
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:34,800
He's right.
I have, but we can not arrest him.

908
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,500
It was a bad idea.
And you... you!

909
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:40,300
You're a fucking sociopath!

910
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:46,200
I'm gonna come as terribly ill
if you touch me, you piece of shit.

911
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,200
- I'll be sorry?
- What?

912
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:52,400

913
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:58,100
Hairdressers stops him before he kills

914
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,500
- I have not killed anyone.
- Not yet.

915
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:07,800
Okay... here's one to be.

916
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:11,100
Anton exit it from decay kid

917
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,900
So you and find the correspondence
that was fucking diamonds.

918
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,800
Typical of you, you've chosen the path of the dead
and destruction.

919
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:23,000
Now it's morning and at any time
someone will find

920
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:28,200
a high guard, neck broken,
home to Kestral.

921
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:33,200
Geckos does not appear to work
and come up to him.

922
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:36,400
They found few traces of yours,
everybody dead

01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,300

- You can not... you can not use it.
- It's unregistered.

927
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:55,700

I like the color of my shoes
and I like that...

929
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:01,300
at the end of the day I defeated Cruz.

930
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:13,600
You might not find diamonds
but you're reward my efforts.

You're in front of you confesses partners
and to go to jail?

937
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:46,000
I do not think they'd love your partner.

938
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:58,800
Shit...

939
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:12,000
- I know where the diamonds.
- Do not tell them. We will kill anyway.

940

01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:35,800
I know where I am, but I do not see.

01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:39,000
And Julie knows, but knows he knows.

946
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:42,900
With my help you can drive
them directly.

947
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:48,500
If you kill, nobody can show thi
where they buried the geckos.

948
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:53,700
It's up to you, man, it's your decision.
It's your decision.

949
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:36,200
Open the trunk!
Poley!

950
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:52,000
If ferent engine running

951
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:03,300
Dr geckos do not answer the phone.

952
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:11,900
Go to geckos. Bring it.

953
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:15,600
- The detector is turned on?
- All systems are all right, sir.

954
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:17,000
Tic tac...

To show you what the hell?

957
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:45,300
You're a jerk, a barber.

958
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,400
A great villain.

959
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:52,000
If he had a contest for the largest
scoundrels in the world.

960
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:55,900
- Exit of the second.
- Yes? Why not first?

961
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,800
Because you're a jerk.

962
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:08,800
Five years before retirement.

963
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:10,900
Damn!

964
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:15,000
- I got here.
- Who cares? Continue to dig.

965
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:17,200
I care, you bastard.

966
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:20,900
Maybe I should stay one minute
to think that metaphysics is very bad.

967
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:23,300
Bad decision.

968
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:26,200
Yes... you found a great moment
for it.

969
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:36,400
- I fucking knew.
- Now!

970
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:41,100
It helps me, you know?

971
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:46,100
Come on, damn!
You put me in it.

972
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:02,400
How about 30 million dollars

973
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:09,800
Damn!

974
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:14,400
Take the gun, take his gun!

975
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,100
What the hell is that?

976
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:26,700
What the hell is that?

977
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:33,100
What is?

978
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:46,200
Shit!

979
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:51,400
Sit down!

980
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:00,400
Damn!

981
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,600
- You okay?
- No. I dropped the gun.

982
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:22,700
Let's see what we fãcuþi.

983
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:45,500
Damn!

984
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:20,700
Lord!

985
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:31,400
Shit!

986
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:39,600
- Maximum speed!
- I can not, I can not!

987
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:47,900
- We can not go faster?
- Damn bitch!

988
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:57,800
Damn!

989
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,700
Coming directly after us.

990
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:09,500
Christ...

991
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,200
Are you okay?

992
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:42,600
Fuck.

993
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:02,600
So, you were blind all along?

994
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:07,100
You are not logged and you came to love everything
and to see what comes out?

995
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,900
Most of the time, yes.
More or less.

996
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:16,500
I mean, Newtonian mechanics
century and is seventeen.

997
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:18,600
Cause and effect are figments.

998
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:23,200
Reality, that is reality
is a sinusoidal function.

999
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:26,000
It's only the probability
nothing is safe.

1000
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:28,200
I mean, you do everything.

1001
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:32,000
You and I face a gecko.

1002
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:36,200
And diamonds worth 30 million.

1003
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:39,300
You should really give them back.
You know...

1004
01:32:39,335 --> 01:32:41,800
In Angola, or Liberia

1005
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,200
or Côte d'Ivoire and
or in the Republic of Congo.

1006
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:46,900
Or something like.

1007
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,300
I do not know.

1008
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:53,600
But God, really love this machine.
