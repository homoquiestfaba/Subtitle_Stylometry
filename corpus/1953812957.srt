You are selling military weapons
to the Cartel.

00:03:39,673 --> 00:03:41,156
Did you really think,
that they're gonna pay you?

44
00:03:42,892 --> 00:03:44,436
You are lucky, we got here first.

A man who kills a legend..

52
00:04:53,357 --> 00:04:55,241
becomes a legend himself.

53
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:23,404
Let's go in.

54
00:05:23,404 --> 00:05:24,416

- You're the one who taught me that the law and justice

57
00:05:30,532 --> 00:05:32,932
aren't always the same thing.

58
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,329
We gotta stop 'em.

59
00:06:17,307 --> 00:06:19,029
Oh Shit.

60
00:06:23,663 --> 00:06:25,481
I wish, you hadn't seen this.

61
00:07:07,492 --> 00:07:10,397
That's quite a resume you got there, Taco.

62
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:13,838
I mean, one might consider you'd be a bit of
an over-achiever when it comes to killing people.

63
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,616
I bet, you consider yourself-
a mean bobber scooter, Don't you?

64
00:07:18,624 --> 00:07:22,926
Specially now, we got 24 Cartel boys
laid out in pieces all over my desert.

65
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:24,833
Well, I got News for you..Taco.

66
00:07:25,425 --> 00:07:27,276
They were the reserves,

00:07:27,276 --> 00:07:29,150
They's the (?)

They're the red-headed Mongoloid runs.
Los Querpos.

69
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,913
Los Querpos don't take kindly
to strangers disciplining their own.

70
00:07:36,913 --> 00:07:37,872
Can I get an 'Amen' on that, Clebourne?

71
00:07:38,701 --> 00:07:39,754
- Amen, Sir.

72
00:07:40,706 --> 00:07:42,237
See, here is the bad news for you Taco.

73
00:07:43,648 --> 00:07:45,844
I never wanna place a vigilante on this parts.

74
00:07:47,444 --> 00:07:50,284
Since, you just killed yourself
a federal officer..

75
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,735
I'm about to have me and mine,

76
00:07:53,623 --> 00:07:54,882
A hog-killing good time.

77
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:56,479
I didn't kill her.

78
00:07:58,137 --> 00:07:59,685
Tometo..tomato.

79
00:08:00,443 --> 00:08:03,123
Let's not get hung up on the details.
Shall we?

80
00:08:03,123 --> 00:08:04,722
Drop him, Clebourne.

81
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,772
I'll be god damned.

82
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:39,568
They say, he doesn't die..sir.

83
00:08:41,477 --> 00:08:42,836
He's been shot..

84
00:08:42,836 --> 00:08:43,746
Stabbed.

85
00:08:44,603 --> 00:08:45,906
Doesn't ever die.

86
00:08:46,676 --> 00:08:48,218
Bull fucking shit,

00:08:48,811 --> 00:08:50,227
This Pedro has got a thick neck, that's all.

88
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,549
Sheriff, it's for you.

89
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,393
Damn sure ain't the governor.

90
00:09:04,426 --> 00:09:05,604
It's The President.

91
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,281
Yeah?

92
00:09:15,281 --> 00:09:17,551
Of Course, Mr.President.
Yes, Sir.

Welcome to The White House.

98
00:11:38,593 --> 00:11:39,981
Good thing we got you, when we did.

99
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:41,649
Southern hospitality can be a bitch.

100
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,956
- Why am I here?
- Right to the point.

101
00:11:44,956 --> 00:11:45,916
I like that.

102
00:11:46,911 --> 00:11:47,818
No, bullshit.

103
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,238
I'm a bit of a no bullshit guy, myself.

104
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,310
So..

105
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,822
all bullshit aside...

106
00:11:54,822 --> 00:11:55,781
- Get someone else.

107
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,901
We need you, Machete.

108
00:12:03,534 --> 00:12:05,446
We got a situation
in our hands.

109
00:12:05,446 --> 00:12:07,883
There's a revolutionary south of the border
name, Marcos Mendez. You've heard of him?

110
00:12:09,902 --> 00:12:10,902
He is..he's crazy.
He is out of his mind.

111
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,883
He's got a missile,
aimed at Washington.

112
00:12:15,854 --> 00:12:18,500
He says, he is gonna blow us up,
if we don't invade Mexico

113
00:12:19,077 --> 00:12:20,899
Clean up the Cartels.
Stop the violence spreading across the country.

114
00:12:22,471 --> 00:12:23,480
- What's that gotta do with me?

115
00:12:24,254 --> 00:12:26,112
The basic violation of Sovereignty aside;

116
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,071
We can't take the bait.

117
00:12:28,452 --> 00:12:31,020
However, you know Mexico.
Hell, you are 'Mexico'.

118
00:12:31,586 --> 00:12:33,534
I want you ahead, make cells..

119
00:12:33,534 --> 00:12:34,702
Find Mendez..

120
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,659
and just, check him out.

121
00:12:38,517 --> 00:12:40,108
But if, what he is saying is true...

122
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:42,557
Kill him.

123
00:12:44,134 --> 00:12:45,176
- Not interested.

124
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:49,843
Motherfucker, i'm not asking
if you are interested.

125

I am the President
of United fucking States, Man.

00:12:59,285 --> 00:13:00,554
- Machete don't smoke.

127
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:05,844
I could just as easily, send you back to your pals.

128
00:13:06,414 --> 00:13:09,224
Hang you high in Arizona.
The way i see it..

129
00:13:10,405 --> 00:13:11,680
You ain't got much to chew on, Hombre.

130
00:13:14,906 --> 00:13:16,038
You know, what this is?

131
00:13:17,604 --> 00:13:18,758
Your criminal record.

132
00:13:19,859 --> 00:13:21,705
Do this for us...

133
00:13:21,705 --> 00:13:23,907
it's gone.

134
00:13:25,177 --> 00:13:26,224
Your past no longer exist.

135
00:13:27,104 --> 00:13:28,767
I'm making you 'legal'.

136
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:31,994
You don't have to sign on anything,
raise your hand and non of that shit.

137
00:13:31,994 --> 00:13:34,487
I just stamp this bad motherfucker...

138
00:13:35,853 --> 00:13:38,330
You are now,
an official citizen of the U.S.A.

139
00:13:43,251 --> 00:13:44,310
I just saved you from your noose.

140
00:13:45,271 --> 00:13:46,525
Save me from mine.

141
00:13:49,445 --> 00:13:50,435
Do it for your country.

142
00:13:51,049 --> 00:13:52,145
Your new country.

143
00:13:54,002 --> 00:13:55,456
Isn't that what your dead girlfriend
would've want?

144
00:13:56,472 --> 00:14:00,123
Agent Sartana.

145
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:03,138
If you don't wanna do this for me,
Machete.

146
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,388
Do it, for her.

147
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,003
Your contact is in San Antionio.

148
00:14:19,003 --> 00:14:21,565
She'll brief you,
and get you across the border over the wall.

149
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:25,004
Your nation owes you a
debt of gratitude, Machete.

150
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,277
Go kick some ass.

151
00:14:28,637 --> 00:14:30,150
Ladies and Gentleman.

152
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,109
El Ray's Network very own,
Miss Texas Pageant Presents-

153
00:14:33,736 --> 00:14:36,213
Miss San Antonio.

154
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:39,407
What do I believe?

155
00:14:40,435 --> 00:14:42,266
I believe in the word 'equality'.

156
00:14:42,773 --> 00:14:44,145
I believe in a woman's right to choose.

157
00:14:44,812 --> 00:14:47,212
Choose what? A snow cone
if that's what you're in the mood for.

158
00:14:47,212 --> 00:14:49,612
I believe in a good barbeque, the two steps..

159
00:14:49,612 --> 00:14:51,017
and the right to carry a gun.

160
00:14:51,017 --> 00:14:53,692
World Peace?
Sure, why not?

161
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:56,091
But if you really wanna talk about World Peace..
we have to start by tearing down

162
00:14:56,091 --> 00:14:58,491
that wall, that's seperating us from Mexico.
That wall -

163
00:14:58,491 --> 00:15:00,892
only enables us to ignore the violence and injustice

164
00:15:00,892 --> 00:15:04,664
that is occuring down there. Thus, making 'World Peace'
nothing more than a beauty pageant pipe dream.

165
00:15:06,218 --> 00:15:10,880
God Bless, Texas.

166
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,604
You must be Machete.

167
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:40,151
Blanca Vasquez, call me
Miss San Antonio.

168
00:15:41,252 --> 00:15:43,022
I'll be hand delivering
the directions of your assignment.

169
00:15:44,036 --> 00:15:48,354
You didn't do a stitch and i'll be the one
who know what's what? The who's who.

170
00:15:48,354 --> 00:15:48,880
the where's where.

171
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,314
entiendes?

172
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:53,118
Try not to be distracted
by the cleavage and the hair spray.

173
00:15:53,981 --> 00:15:56,378
It's part of my cover.

174
00:16:04,524 --> 00:16:06,000
What happened to world peace?

175
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,159
Fuck world peace.

176
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,377
Import carbine long range.

177
00:16:09,165 --> 00:16:11,248
With reflex sides ..

178
00:16:11,248 --> 00:16:12,938
Customised trigger.

179
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:15,817
Fast enought to drop
jack rabbit on roller skates.

180
00:16:15,817 --> 00:16:17,123
That is of course..

181
00:16:17,123 --> 00:16:19,715
If you happen to come across jackrabbit on roller skates

182
00:16:19,715 --> 00:16:21,530
or my personal favourite..

183
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:22,950
The grab fire.

184
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:27,058
Fires upto 30 yards. Good for when you've
got to scratch those hard to reach places.

185
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:31,415
- I like this.
- I like your style. Low tech.

186
00:16:32,621 --> 00:16:35,086
But this ain't your mom's hand gun.

187
00:16:35,806 --> 00:16:37,823
Consider this as Swiss Army knives Machetes.

188
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,112
Machete.

189
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,079
Tell me about Mendez.

190
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,525
Marcos Mendez is the most sicken twisted
fucking bastard

191
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:50,329
if've ever have to keep my tabs on.

192
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:53,874
People down south calls him
Marcos 'the mad man'.

193
00:16:53,874 --> 00:16:54,628
He used to run with Los Quertos.

194
00:16:55,455 --> 00:16:56,539
Till, one day..he wakes up and decides

195
00:16:57,069 --> 00:16:59,784
he's gonna turn on the cartel.
Funding from the people.

196
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,587
We figure he is laying in the
jungles and marsh lands

197
00:17:02,587 --> 00:17:03,548
but our Satellite cannot pinpoint him.

198
00:17:03,548 --> 00:17:06,550
Our only lead is this prize winner.

199
00:17:07,129 --> 00:17:09,624
Working girl.
Goes by the name of Cereza.

200
00:17:09,624 --> 00:17:11,890
You find her..
you find Mendez.

201
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,043
Where can I find her?

202
00:17:13,043 --> 00:17:13,666
In Acapulco.

203
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:14,002
With confirmation address linking her
to brothel in dust city.

204
00:17:16,729 --> 00:17:18,092
Ah..uh ah.

205
00:17:18,092 --> 00:17:18,974
First..

206
00:17:19,983 --> 00:17:21,066
I might need something from you.

207
00:17:21,595 --> 00:17:23,418
See..even here.
People talk about 'Machete'.

208
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:26,519
The man..

209
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:29,216
The Myth.

210
00:17:30,754 --> 00:17:31,944
The Legend.

211
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:35,265
I just wanna know the legend,
inside and out.

212
00:17:35,265 --> 00:17:38,232
I just lost someone.

213
00:17:41,467 --> 00:17:44,578
Why don't you let me turn that bad
upside down, Papi.

214
00:18:23,378 --> 00:18:24,526
A lot has changed since then.

215
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:27,890
Acapulco is the war zone.

216
00:18:28,698 --> 00:18:30,301
I'm dropping you right
in the middle of it.

217
00:18:30,301 --> 00:18:31,452
Here.

218
00:18:31,452 --> 00:18:33,563
Direct line to yours truly.

219
00:18:33,563 --> 00:18:36,996
If you need to you just press #
and phone home.

220
00:18:36,996 --> 00:18:37,956
For calls, text..tweets.

221
00:18:39,489 --> 00:18:41,165
Machete, don't tweet.

222
00:18:41,165 --> 00:18:43,136
You do now.

223
00:18:44,566 --> 00:18:45,332
Ready for this?

224
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:15,230
Alright!

225
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,189
For all of you new girls..

226
00:19:17,176 --> 00:19:18,625
It's special 'Pussy Tuesday'.

227
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:23,973
Keep your panties dropped on your legs
spread and your snatch well oiled.

228
00:19:24,598 --> 00:19:26,430
Cos your not walking
any straight lines tomorrow.

229
00:19:27,247 --> 00:19:29,647
Cos you know,
every jerk off

230
00:19:29,647 --> 00:19:32,047
low life from this side of your grande

231
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:34,600
is gonna barge through that door

232
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,357
as soon as the sun comes down.

233
00:19:36,357 --> 00:19:39,159
So, get em off and get them out.

234
00:19:40,494 --> 00:19:42,894
And ladies, every stiff

235
00:19:42,894 --> 00:19:47,166
pecker partners pays to play.
No freebies.

236
00:19:47,877 --> 00:19:50,276
Those are house rules.

237
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:52,674
Throw on something.
In five minutes.

238
00:19:54,841 --> 00:19:55,987
You are early, handsome.

239
00:19:56,574 --> 00:19:58,090
But then, again...

240
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,306
the early bird gets the fresh head.

241
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,112
I'm looking for a girl.

242
00:20:03,112 --> 00:20:05,924
- And i'm looking at a guy
that came to the right place.

243
00:20:05,924 --> 00:20:06,499
Pick your poison.

244
00:20:07,566 --> 00:20:09,052
This is the one, I want.

245
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:14,141
Why this one?

246
00:20:14,852 --> 00:20:15,964
The best in Mexico.

247
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,836
Have a seat on the couch, Sugar boy.

248
00:20:18,932 --> 00:20:19,988
I'll go fetch her, for you.

249
00:20:45,399 --> 00:20:46,549
Where is the girl?

250
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:48,566
Upstairs.

251
00:20:48,566 --> 00:20:49,967
Room 6.

252
00:20:49,967 --> 00:20:54,613
But don't go.
You'll miss the big show.

253
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,061
Kill him!

254
00:21:15,302 --> 00:21:18,623
Who the fuck are you?
- Machete.

255
00:21:18,623 --> 00:21:23,028
I've heard nice news of you.
You want me to get something?

256
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,278
Take me.

257
00:21:26,278 --> 00:21:27,236
Now.

258
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:39,826
I said, No freebies.

259
00:21:43,986 --> 00:21:45,482
You know, the first thing we are taught
is how to defend ourselves.

260
00:21:46,645 --> 00:21:47,853
Anyone of us could've killed you.

261
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,204
You think my mom had fight?

262
00:21:51,781 --> 00:21:53,230
Mendez is gonna cut you like a Gay man.

263
00:21:53,816 --> 00:21:55,178
- That was your Mother?

264
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:58,164
You are here to kill him, aren't you?

265
00:21:58,164 --> 00:22:00,371
Look, don't be a fucking hero man.

266
00:22:01,784 --> 00:22:04,415
Mendez is many things.
But, merciful is not one of 'em.

267
00:22:04,415 --> 00:22:06,381
He will skin you alive,
if you lay your hands on me.

268
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:09,682
I am his 'Cereza'.
His Virgin.

269
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:13,446
Mendez isn't who you think, he is.

270
00:22:13,446 --> 00:22:16,677
The terrible things he did.
He did it for perfectly greater good!

271
00:22:16,677 --> 00:22:19,713
What he truly wants,
is a better Mexico.

272
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:21,493
Mechete, you have to promise me.

273
00:22:22,273 --> 00:22:23,584
Spare his life.

274
00:22:23,584 --> 00:22:24,737
And help him.

275
00:22:24,737 --> 00:22:26,826
Please, Machete?

276
00:22:28,021 --> 00:22:29,671
If you've ever loved anyone.

277
00:22:29,671 --> 00:22:32,273
You would understand.

278
00:22:41,752 --> 00:22:43,297
Do nothing. Say, nothing.

279
00:22:43,297 --> 00:22:44,108
I'll handle it.

280
00:22:48,307 --> 00:22:49,629
Who is this?

281
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:51,127
He's a bodyguard.

282
00:22:51,127 --> 00:22:56,790
Mother's orders.
Go ahead, Zoren call it in.

283
00:23:13,153 --> 00:23:16,533
See, here's the thing.
He's lost his mind.

284
00:23:16,533 --> 00:23:17,764
There are two sides to him now.

285
00:23:18,942 --> 00:23:23,188
Somedays, he is Mendez -
The Revolutionary fighting for the people.

286
00:23:23,188 --> 00:23:24,298
In other days...

287
00:23:24,298 --> 00:23:26,583
He is Mendez -
The Mad Man.

288
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:28,526
Relieving his Cartel glory.

289
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:32,232
Its a toss up, which one
you are gonna get.

290
00:23:32,232 --> 00:23:34,828
So, he'll either hug you
or he will kill you.

291
00:23:34,828 --> 00:23:37,614
His condition gets worst everyday.

292
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,724
Boss has a message for you, Machete.

293
00:23:52,872 --> 00:23:54,493
End of message.

294
00:24:19,175 --> 00:24:21,805
Look..what the little whore dragged in.

295
00:24:22,411 --> 00:24:23,783
Machete Cortel!

296
00:24:25,396 --> 00:24:26,586
Yes, i've heard your story.

297
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,598
People still sings songs about you.

298
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,994
Raise your hand...!
If you've sung a song -

299
00:24:35,994 --> 00:24:37,501
about our friend, Machete here.

300
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,279
The only son of a bitch needs
praise a song around here,

301
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:53,176
is me.

302
00:24:53,176 --> 00:24:54,136
Tell me, Mahchete..

303
00:24:55,367 --> 00:24:56,546
What did you think of my Cereza?..heh

304
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:00,906
It's a shame, I had to let her go.
But, by bringing you here...

305
00:25:00,906 --> 00:25:02,142
She betrayed me.

306
00:25:03,795 --> 00:25:05,833
She was trying to save you.

307
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:06,986
You know what this is?

308
00:25:06,986 --> 00:25:12,651
This is the end of my I-plan to
fire off the ass of the united states.

309
00:25:12,651 --> 00:25:13,585
Why Mendez?

310
00:25:14,739 --> 00:25:17,281
Cos our people don't need
songs or stories.

311
00:25:18,253 --> 00:25:19,749
They need 'action'!

312
00:25:19,749 --> 00:25:21,564
There is other ways.

313
00:25:21,564 --> 00:25:23,224
The motherfuckers run this country.

314
00:25:23,984 --> 00:25:25,567
The corrupt politicians..

315
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:26,978
The media hiding the truths...

316
00:25:27,642 --> 00:25:30,184
The Cartels..killing anything and anyone
who stands in their path.

317
00:25:30,886 --> 00:25:31,941
The U.S -

318
00:25:32,825 --> 00:25:33,956
is responsible for a lot of these.

319
00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:37,707
Since, they will take care of their
part of the problem;

320
00:25:37,707 --> 00:25:40,279
We will send our part of the problem,
to them!

321
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:42,011
You are crazy.

322
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:46,695
I know why, you are here, Machete.

323
00:25:47,887 --> 00:25:50,228
You work for the enemy now, huh?

324
00:25:55,192 --> 00:25:56,643
I got news for you, Cabron.

325
00:25:56,643 --> 00:25:58,032
Killing me ain't in the card.

326
00:25:58,793 --> 00:26:01,278
Cos I am,
the king fucking wrath

327
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:03,870
of Mexico, Motherfucker.

328
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,490
Thanks to my good Doctor here.

329
00:26:07,077 --> 00:26:08,679
The missile's launch system,

330
00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:10,850
is linked...

331
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:13,440
right into my heart.

332
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,138
So, if my heart stops beating.

333
00:26:15,138 --> 00:26:18,944
Washington will become
the bright shining light, we always thought it was.

334
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:22,850
I'll disarm it.

335
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:26,928
There is only two men in the world
who knows how to do that.

336
00:26:27,822 --> 00:26:28,820
Correction- One.

337
00:26:29,367 --> 00:26:30,882
Who's the other one?

338
00:26:30,882 --> 00:26:33,289
The one who created this beautiful device,
of course.

339
00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:34,590
Since, he lives in the U.S

340
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:37,804
I'm afraid you are fucked.

341
00:26:38,688 --> 00:26:40,905
You have failed.

342
00:26:43,019 --> 00:26:45,360
Machete, don't fail.

343
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,314
What you gonna do?
You wanna kill me?

344
00:26:58,887 --> 00:27:00,721
I ain't gonna kill you.
I'm gonna kill your men.

345
00:27:00,721 --> 00:27:03,308
Steal your chopper and
get you over the wall.

346
00:27:03,308 --> 00:27:04,460
- Leave him to me.

347
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,932
Find the other one,
who can disarm you.

348
00:27:08,513 --> 00:27:10,066
Shoot me!

349
00:27:17,363 --> 00:27:18,961
Let me take care of him.

350
00:27:18,961 --> 00:27:22,482
Please.

351
00:27:45,343 --> 00:27:48,841
Even if we get out of here alive,
my men are instructed to put a bomb through my head.

352
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:50,538
Ten Million dollars.

353
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,158
The best part is...

354
00:27:55,823 --> 00:28:00,080
Fail safe - my ticking heart.
We just went live.

355
00:28:01,131 --> 00:28:02,502
We got 24 hours my friend.

356
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:08,809
That 10 million dollars,
if the assassins don't get it..the cartels will.

357
00:28:58,374 --> 00:29:00,544
- Yeah?
- What's the status?

358
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,695
Is he dead?

359
00:29:01,695 --> 00:29:04,331
I have Mendez in custody,
in the chopper.

360
00:29:04,331 --> 00:29:06,433
He is alive.
- Wait a second.

361
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:11,028
Machete..

362
00:29:11,028 --> 00:29:11,400
What's this i hear about you having
Mendez in custody?

363
00:29:13,803 --> 00:29:15,763
- Thing's got complicated.
- No shit.

364
00:29:15,763 --> 00:29:16,916
You were supposed to take him out.

365
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:18,917
not give him a joy ride,
and get him some lollipop.

366
00:29:18,917 --> 00:29:21,448
Damn it!
I didn't recruit you for your sense of compassion.

367
00:29:21,448 --> 00:29:22,499
Machete..Kills!

368
00:29:23,663 --> 00:29:24,781
That's what he does.

369
00:29:24,781 --> 00:29:25,741
He doesn't save..the bad guys.

370
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,819
Now, shoot that Motherfucker!

371
00:29:27,819 --> 00:29:28,701
- If he dies, you die.

372
00:29:28,701 --> 00:29:28,778
The Missile's wired to his heart.
- Come, come again?

373
00:29:33,202 --> 00:29:35,601
- Machete, can it be disarmed?
- Only, where it was made.

374
00:29:38,078 --> 00:29:41,766
- Voztech.
- Voztech is the biggest weapon supplyer to our military.

375
00:29:41,766 --> 00:29:43,677
You wanna bring him back
all the way to the fucking manufacturer?

376
00:29:43,677 --> 00:29:48,054
I need your help getting him across the border.
This part is upsetting me.

377
00:29:48,054 --> 00:29:49,082
- I'm feeling it.
- Not happening.

378
00:29:49,082 --> 00:29:52,692
The last time i sent a black ops team into Mexico,
they got dead and i got the Oval Ass fuck.

379
00:29:52,692 --> 00:29:53,660
You are on your own, Machete.

380
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,514
We cannot help you, until you're
out of Mexico, You hear me?

381
00:29:56,514 --> 00:29:58,100
Now, get the hell out of there,
As fast as you can.

382
00:29:59,051 --> 00:30:01,846
Machete, double time it to the border.
I'll assist you as much as possible..

383
00:30:01,846 --> 00:30:04,002
But you've got to
move your ass!

384
00:31:18,897 --> 00:31:20,038
What happened?

385
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,646
You don't remember?

386
00:31:26,643 --> 00:31:27,976
I'm in this condition, I am afraid..

387
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:33,129
I seem to switch my personality, unexpectedly.

388
00:31:33,129 --> 00:31:34,235
- You tried to kill yourself.

389
00:31:34,755 --> 00:31:37,509
You strapped a bomb to your chest.

390
00:31:40,864 --> 00:31:41,513
The fail safe defense are

391
00:31:42,665 --> 00:31:44,267
already in motion.

392
00:31:44,855 --> 00:31:46,485
I am Marcos Mendez.

393
00:31:47,053 --> 00:31:48,952
Leader of the revolution.
And you are?

394
00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:51,150
- Machete.

395
00:31:51,737 --> 00:31:56,301
- I've heard of you. People sings songs about you..
- We've had this talk already. C'mon, get up.

396
00:31:57,612 --> 00:31:59,224
- I didn't hurt anyone, did I?

397
00:32:00,358 --> 00:32:01,691
You had Cereza Killed.

398
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,955
aaah..

399
00:32:07,337 --> 00:32:08,412
Then, i must..

400
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:10,754
i must die.

401
00:32:12,434 --> 00:32:15,111
I'd lay down my life, for the cause.

402
00:32:15,111 --> 00:32:16,504
And if you choose to be in my company,

403
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:20,789
I fear, you will become
a casualty as well.

404
00:32:22,034 --> 00:32:23,434
Come on.

405
00:33:04,367 --> 00:33:05,913
You should've kept up with your
spanish there, son.

406
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:09,580
Sounds like, we maybe able to string up
this Pi?ta after all.

407
00:33:10,609 --> 00:33:15,869
Let's get on it, Clayborn.

408
00:33:27,437 --> 00:33:30,496
You wouldn't happen to have
a popsicle to stick up my ass would you?

409
00:33:33,936 --> 00:33:37,315
A martini...extra dirty.

410
00:33:38,084 --> 00:33:41,223
..two olives..
- all we have is tequila and chango.

411
00:33:41,223 --> 00:33:42,181
Right.

412
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,638
For a moment there, i forgot
i was in the blackhole of sophistication,

413
00:33:45,638 --> 00:33:46,857
Chango it is.

414
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:53,608
Although, your new selection of mexican beer
is not what brings me here.

415
00:33:53,608 --> 00:33:54,567
- So, what does?
- You do, Carlos.

416
00:34:02,323 --> 00:34:03,596
But it can't be.

417
00:34:03,596 --> 00:34:05,509
They say, you don't have a face.

418
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:08,083
They say, you don't exist.
- I may not exist...

419
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:09,858
But this gun, does.

420
00:34:09,858 --> 00:34:11,010
You don't have to do this.

421
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:14,593
You can tell whoever hired you,
that i'll give back the money...

422
00:34:14,593 --> 00:34:18,210
- This isn't about the money, Carlos.
It is about my employer...it's about ethics.

423
00:34:19,169 --> 00:34:23,558
Now, if i don't shoot you square in the face,
I will be violating a...

424
00:34:23,558 --> 00:34:25,236
contractual obligation and all that...

425
00:34:25,236 --> 00:34:29,735
'Don't' beg emotional confrontation makes me
very uncomfortable.

426
00:34:31,309 --> 00:34:32,973
How much for the chango.

427
00:34:32,973 --> 00:34:36,220
- fifty cents.
-I'm gonna give you seventy five.

428
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,595
Do you have a change for a dollar?

429
00:35:00,497 --> 00:35:02,292
I don't know where the hell
we are.

430
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,025
Excuse me?

431
00:35:08,781 --> 00:35:11,506
We are a little lost..
any chance you could steer us to Leon?

432
00:35:12,075 --> 00:35:13,475
I could.

433
00:35:14,676 --> 00:35:17,003
The trouble is..
you've seen my face.

434
00:35:17,613 --> 00:35:19,227
And I have just changed.

435
00:35:27,847 --> 00:35:28,959
I'm truly sorry, Ma'm.

436
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:34,238
It's just a matter of time and place,
not being in your favour.

437
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:56,068
Man eater.

438
00:35:57,375 --> 00:36:00,692
That's what they used to call me
when i was just little girl.

439
00:36:01,916 --> 00:36:03,154
I didn't know what that meant.

440
00:36:03,845 --> 00:36:05,929
That never stopped my daddy,

441
00:36:05,929 --> 00:36:08,751
coming into my bed
after a night of drinking.

442
00:36:11,911 --> 00:36:12,964
So, one night...

443
00:36:14,137 --> 00:36:16,402
I gave him what he deserved.

444
00:36:18,453 --> 00:36:22,038
I chewed his balls off with my teeth.

445
00:36:24,722 --> 00:36:26,144
The next day..

446
00:36:26,144 --> 00:36:30,138
I went to school with pieces
of him, still in my braces.

447
00:36:32,552 --> 00:36:35,181
I became what he always
said I was.

448
00:36:35,181 --> 00:36:36,397
A Man eater!

449
00:36:40,028 --> 00:36:44,567
I despise men,
I can't trust them.

450
00:36:44,567 --> 00:36:47,829
And that pussy clouds their minds.

451
00:36:49,129 --> 00:36:51,421
And now my little Cereza lays dead

452
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:54,580
Because of that reason.

453
00:36:57,141 --> 00:36:59,626
And that's where you come in.

454
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:03,873
Just a random selection.

455
00:37:03,873 --> 00:37:06,184
And that you might be,

456
00:37:06,184 --> 00:37:08,507
You still remind me of my own Papi.

457
00:37:16,957 --> 00:37:17,927
Madam?

458
00:37:18,859 --> 00:37:20,221
-Yes?
- We found them.

459
00:37:20,788 --> 00:37:22,807
Mendez and Machete.

460
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:23,959
- Bring me my Double Ds.

461
00:37:23,959 --> 00:37:26,122
Gather all the girls.

462
00:37:26,122 --> 00:37:29,329
We are going to avenge..
my Cereza.

463
00:37:40,813 --> 00:37:42,626
You read my mind, Machete.

464
00:37:44,904 --> 00:37:46,889
Yes, yup yup.
This is the perfect place for my last meal.

465
00:37:51,671 --> 00:37:55,698
Give me and my friend here,
a plate of your finest Cabrito.

466
00:37:55,698 --> 00:37:56,422
And..

467
00:37:57,622 --> 00:37:59,619
give us some bread and wine too.

468
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:00,578
Thank you.

469
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:26,466
See, Machete..

470
00:38:26,466 --> 00:38:29,152
You are the only one,
who doesn't want me dead.

471
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:42,972
What the hell are you doing
back in Mexico?

472
00:38:43,845 --> 00:38:47,204
Your federale brothers were very upset
that you abandoned us in the heat of battle.

473
00:38:47,877 --> 00:38:51,237
I heard you moved to The U.S
cleaning rich people's pools huh?

474
00:38:51,237 --> 00:38:52,388
Put the gun down.

475
00:38:52,388 --> 00:38:53,541
He is a murderer.

476
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:55,666
He killed 13 Federales,
in cold blood.

477
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,863
13 crooked Federales.

478
00:38:57,863 --> 00:38:58,858
Buried in Quertos pocket.

479
00:38:59,934 --> 00:39:01,277
How the fuck would you know that, Puto?

480
00:39:01,969 --> 00:39:03,658
- I was undercover.

481
00:39:03,658 --> 00:39:04,599
- an agent.

482
00:39:05,377 --> 00:39:08,546
There's no agents in Mexico.

483
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:11,558
- Last and only,
super agent.

484
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:15,023
Give me one good reason,  i shouldn't shoot
him like a dog that he is.

485
00:39:15,023 --> 00:39:17,545
If he dies, thousands in Washington
would die with him.

486
00:39:17,545 --> 00:39:19,607
- And if he lives..
how many more would die?

487
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,044
And why help the U.S?

488
00:39:21,044 --> 00:39:23,040
- Cos, i'm the only one who can.

489
00:39:23,743 --> 00:39:26,142
- You were always a sensitive one, Machete.

490
00:39:26,142 --> 00:39:29,769
- Wow, hoah..bloody hell!
It's a Mexican Stand off.

491
00:39:30,365 --> 00:39:32,487
I am taking him in.
- Oh, really where?

492
00:39:33,063 --> 00:39:35,224
You will trade me,
straight to the Cartels.

493
00:39:35,224 --> 00:39:39,860
Machete, this man is a dirty cop.
- Shut your fucking mouth!

494
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,013
Shut up, Loco.

495
00:39:41,013 --> 00:39:41,970
- You shouldn't have said that, Amigo.

496
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:45,448
Because if you call me loco-

497
00:39:45,448 --> 00:39:46,407
Than i'm afraid..

498
00:39:46,955 --> 00:39:50,043
loco is what you get.

499
00:40:00,316 --> 00:40:02,528
- Hello again, Machete.
- Say one more word...

500
00:40:02,528 --> 00:40:04,396
Make sure you better make it, Machete.

501
00:40:04,396 --> 00:40:06,433
All you have to do is
pull the fucking trigger, Come on.

502
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,298
See Machete..

503
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:21,918
Justice and law,
are not always the same thing.

504
00:40:31,833 --> 00:40:32,945
What the fuck is going on here?

505
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:37,575
Look at me, top scores.

506
00:41:37,575 --> 00:41:40,012
Forgive my excitement,
but i'm just learning to speak Spanish.

507
00:41:40,012 --> 00:41:41,164
Not by choice.

508
00:41:41,164 --> 00:41:43,757
But i can't get the CD to change
for the life of me.

509
00:41:43,757 --> 00:41:45,127
Fuck it,
When in Rome, right?

510
00:41:45,953 --> 00:41:48,979
I'm trying to find a place call..
Villa Gerrero.

511
00:41:48,979 --> 00:41:50,479
Perhaps, you've heard of it?

512
00:41:50,479 --> 00:41:53,589
You haven't heard of it?
or No se..you don't understand the question?

513
00:41:56,189 --> 00:41:57,289
Un momento?

514
00:41:57,289 --> 00:41:59,868
Allow me to use more
useful illustration.

515
00:41:59,868 --> 00:42:01,215
I'm really trying here.

516
00:42:01,974 --> 00:42:06,099
And if you say 'No Se' one more time,
i'm gonna put a bullet in your brain.

517
00:42:06,099 --> 00:42:08,090
Out of sheer frustration.

518
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:11,410
Now, Villa Guerrero?

519
00:42:16,662 --> 00:42:19,791
Your sense of direction doesn't inspire
confidence in you.

520
00:42:22,979 --> 00:42:26,788
Allow me to translate.

521
00:42:36,313 --> 00:42:37,830
Damn!

522
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:40,046
I was just starting to get used
to this face.

523
00:43:36,675 --> 00:43:37,223
El Doctoro?

524
00:43:45,441 --> 00:43:47,428
Get the fuck out of here,
I'm performing surgery.

525
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:53,514
Put him in the bed, there.

526
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:56,560
Where are they?
- Still inside.

527
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,651
Okay, i need you to check the rear.

528
00:44:17,032 --> 00:44:18,524
Machete!

529
00:44:18,524 --> 00:44:20,572
Come out and play.

530
00:44:40,695 --> 00:44:42,333
What's the hurry, Lover boy.

531
00:45:03,142 --> 00:45:04,513
Ugh..disgusting.

532
00:45:17,484 --> 00:45:19,249
So, i'm still alive.

533
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:22,441
Good for you Machete.
Good for you.

534
00:45:22,441 --> 00:45:25,056
Is this the crazy you, talking?

535
00:45:26,815 --> 00:45:29,340
I can't continue living my life like this.

536
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,407
- You used to be Cartel.

537
00:45:31,407 --> 00:45:34,129
And then, you became a revolutionary.

538
00:45:35,835 --> 00:45:37,251
- Why?
- I was never Cartel.

539
00:45:39,697 --> 00:45:42,097
I was a Secret Agent,
for the Mexican Government.

540
00:45:42,097 --> 00:45:44,496
My mission,

541
00:45:44,496 --> 00:45:47,339
was to infiltrate Los Querpos.

542
00:45:47,339 --> 00:45:48,297
I had to see things..

543
00:45:50,335 --> 00:45:52,209
I had to do things.

544
00:45:52,209 --> 00:45:56,677
Had to watch people die
in the worst way you can imagine.

545
00:45:56,677 --> 00:45:59,419
Compromising the only thing
i believe in.

546
00:45:59,419 --> 00:46:00,379
I became one of them.

547
00:46:02,378 --> 00:46:06,847
I remember, calling my supervisor;
telling him that i wanted out..

548
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,403
I wanted my life back.

549
00:46:09,403 --> 00:46:12,050
But i didn't know he was dirty.

550
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:14,937
That he'd been bought by the cartels.

551
00:46:14,937 --> 00:46:18,275
They took me to a killing room.

552
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,945
With my wife and daughter there, waiting.

553
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:23,787
They made me watch.

554
00:46:25,555 --> 00:46:29,805
First they beat them.
Tortured them.

555
00:46:29,805 --> 00:46:30,763
Then, that's when..

556
00:46:33,789 --> 00:46:36,196
The Mad Man took over for the first time.

557
00:46:36,196 --> 00:46:40,720
My wife and baby girl died
b'cause i trusted our system that did not exist.

558
00:46:41,974 --> 00:46:44,754
I realised then, If i was to change Mexico

559
00:46:46,219 --> 00:46:47,722
I must do it myself.

560
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:48,680
I started my own revolution
against same reason motherfuckers

561
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:54,470
responsible for this violence.

562
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:56,870
I will die to see it through.

563
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:59,270
The real tragedy of all this is that

564
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:02,390
people would never know the
real truth about me.

565
00:47:03,407 --> 00:47:07,065
How about you?
Does anybody know the real Machete?

566
00:47:07,065 --> 00:47:10,088
Where is your partner?
Every guy has a partner.

567
00:47:10,713 --> 00:47:13,113
You couldn't give up the life, can't you?

568
00:47:13,113 --> 00:47:14,548
Think about it.
How old are you?

569
00:47:14,548 --> 00:47:16,435
In your line of work...

570
00:47:17,163 --> 00:47:19,158
Why have you lived so long?

571
00:47:19,158 --> 00:47:20,116
Partners knew about self sacrifice..

572
00:47:20,898 --> 00:47:22,485
for the greater good.

573
00:47:22,485 --> 00:47:23,637
Not you, though.

574
00:47:23,637 --> 00:47:26,084
You know what you are?

575
00:47:26,084 --> 00:47:27,042
Vengeance.

576
00:47:28,926 --> 00:47:30,888
You are vengeance.

577
00:47:30,888 --> 00:47:31,847
A vengeance never dies.

578
00:47:40,952 --> 00:47:43,422
We will never make it to the border wall
with this piece of shit.

579
00:47:43,422 --> 00:47:46,461
We need a stronger vehicle.
An armored vehicle.

580
00:47:46,461 --> 00:47:48,552
I know where we can get one.

581
00:47:48,552 --> 00:47:49,515
Small town near the border.

582
00:47:49,515 --> 00:47:51,951
There's a chop shop there.

583
00:47:57,214 --> 00:47:58,384
Once he crosses the border.

584
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:00,161
We can move in.

585
00:48:11,402 --> 00:48:12,227
Come on.

586
00:48:14,043 --> 00:48:16,902
Come on, we gonna cross the wall or what.

587
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:22,893
This is a cartel turf,
you let us right to it.

588
00:48:22,893 --> 00:48:23,852
Shhh.

589
00:48:40,068 --> 00:48:40,479
Looking for a ride.

590
00:48:41,123 --> 00:48:44,698
Well, this lane..
you're best off fucking rent a car.

591
00:48:45,539 --> 00:48:47,526
This is all custom works.

592
00:48:47,526 --> 00:48:49,255
I will do as he says, Grasa.

593
00:48:49,255 --> 00:48:51,192
Well, look at this.

594
00:48:51,702 --> 00:48:53,333
Marcos Mendez

595
00:48:54,832 --> 00:48:56,412
in the flesh.

596
00:48:56,412 --> 00:48:57,564
This will do.

597
00:48:57,564 --> 00:48:58,835
No shit. It will do.

598
00:48:58,835 --> 00:49:00,418
That baby is my fucking masterpiece.

599
00:49:01,608 --> 00:49:04,824
You could take it to a mine field
with flat tyre.

600
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:22,516
You aren't gonna shoot a man
in a wheel chair, would you?

601
00:49:23,257 --> 00:49:25,021
- No.

602
00:50:18,446 --> 00:50:20,902
Hola, Motherfucker!

603
00:50:53,157 --> 00:50:54,476
Hey there, loverboy.

604
00:51:00,161 --> 00:51:01,470
Hey there, give them hand.

605
00:51:03,054 --> 00:51:05,089
I've got a special package for him.

606
00:51:05,089 --> 00:51:06,233
Killjoy...

607
00:51:06,233 --> 00:51:08,191
give me my strap on.

608
00:52:26,113 --> 00:52:29,473
Ho..ho ho! Fuck Machete..

609
00:52:29,473 --> 00:52:30,815
You're crazier than I am!

610
00:52:38,084 --> 00:52:39,499
Machete, what the hell are you doing?

611
00:52:41,511 --> 00:52:43,806
- Is there other way?
- There's no other way..

612
00:52:43,806 --> 00:52:46,787
that's why they call it a wall..
goddamn it.

613
00:52:46,787 --> 00:52:48,582
Take 'em away.

614
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,800
See that frigging tag under the wall,

615
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,805
drive us straight through it.

616
00:52:52,805 --> 00:52:53,762
The heat is to the other side..

617
00:53:00,006 --> 00:53:01,152
Hit it.

618
00:53:31,986 --> 00:53:33,004
We made it.

619
00:53:35,538 --> 00:53:36,997
Well, sweet Isabel.

620
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:38,658
I think we just hit a fucking stroke...

621
00:53:39,379 --> 00:53:40,684
Beginner's luck.

622
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:42,582
Running into you again, Taco.

623
00:53:42,582 --> 00:53:46,550
You know, you and your compadre are
going for about 10 million buck to rooster head.

624
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:48,480
I never understand anything about Algebra..

625
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,543
That is a..shitfire..

626
00:53:50,438 --> 00:53:52,682
fuck me..Halleluijah lot of Money.

627
00:53:53,327 --> 00:53:55,687
I think, we ought to take advantage of
your lucrative predicament.

628
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:57,664
Get ourselves to squares.

629
00:53:58,309 --> 00:54:00,901
No distractions, this time.
Right, Clebourne?

630
00:54:00,901 --> 00:54:03,473
That's right, sir.
- Alright then,

631
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:04,586
Sayonara Taco.

632
00:54:24,506 --> 00:54:26,389
Special Agent, Mendez.

633
00:54:26,389 --> 00:54:28,178
How many of you are there?

634
00:54:28,178 --> 00:54:29,138
- Sorry, that's classified.

635
00:54:33,062 --> 00:54:34,127
And who is this?

636
00:54:36,233 --> 00:54:37,370
My wanted party.

637
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:48,104
You didn't think, it would all be over
once we cross the border did you?

638
00:54:48,104 --> 00:54:51,328
Who do you think got me into Mexico,
in the first place?

639
00:54:53,526 --> 00:54:55,536
There's a great conductor
behind all this.

640
00:55:41,733 --> 00:55:43,647
Why re-elect President Rathcock?

641
00:55:43,647 --> 00:55:47,862
He dished out 6 Million dollars
on tax payers money to space technology company

642
00:55:47,862 --> 00:55:49,015
like Voztech industries.

643
00:55:49,015 --> 00:55:52,987
He build a wall to protect us
from the thread of illegals.

644
00:55:52,987 --> 00:55:55,515
He took a stand and defended
our second ammendment.

645
00:55:55,515 --> 00:55:56,474
with a vengeance.

646
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:00,873
And to boost our national economy
to an all time high...

647
00:56:00,873 --> 00:56:03,672
He made marijuana legal
in 48 states.

648
00:56:03,672 --> 00:56:04,926
My fellow Americans...

649
00:56:04,926 --> 00:56:06,572
It's been a groovy four years.

650
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:08,173
There are still so much
left to accomplish.

651
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:11,198
For me, winning..
was only the begining.

652
00:56:11,198 --> 00:56:13,599
Re-elect Rathcock.

653
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:16,420
A name you like,
A face you can trust.

654
00:56:32,952 --> 00:56:34,601
Don't worry Mr.Cortez

655
00:56:35,256 --> 00:56:37,088
You haven't fail your Mission, Yet.

656
00:56:41,745 --> 00:56:43,204
- Where am I?

657
00:56:43,204 --> 00:56:46,544
- Recuperating in my subjuest healing pool,
right now..you like it?

658
00:56:47,284 --> 00:56:49,684
As you can see,
our friend Marcos Cortez is still...

659
00:56:49,684 --> 00:56:53,965
very much alive and ticking.

660
00:56:54,714 --> 00:56:56,308
Which makes him still very much,

661
00:56:56,308 --> 00:56:58,247
a threat.

662
00:56:58,247 --> 00:56:59,312
It needs to be disarmed.

663
00:57:00,072 --> 00:57:03,180
You don't know what you're dealing with.
- Well, Actually I do.

664
00:57:03,767 --> 00:57:08,345
I invented it.
Allow me to introduce myself..My name is

665
00:57:08,998 --> 00:57:11,400
Luther Voz.
Let me admit..

666
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:14,126
i've been following your career for
quite some time now.

667
00:57:14,126 --> 00:57:16,431
I am tremendous fan of
your work Mr.Cortez.

668
00:57:16,431 --> 00:57:18,809
As an afficionado of ' The arts of War' myself;

669
00:57:18,809 --> 00:57:21,572
I just gotta say that,
you're one genuine article

670
00:57:21,572 --> 00:57:24,195
Genghis Khan of My caliber.
Fucker, people lover.

671
00:57:24,195 --> 00:57:25,817
You are a warrior Mr.Cortez.

672
00:57:27,517 --> 00:57:29,934
A killer. A survivor..
llike me.

673
00:57:30,896 --> 00:57:34,015
Just try to relax.
I mean, if i wanted you dead..

674
00:57:34,669 --> 00:57:36,290
you will be fucking dead.

675
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:37,519
Are you gonna disarm it or not?

676
00:57:38,162 --> 00:57:39,621
I'm leaning towards not.

677
00:57:40,995 --> 00:57:42,818
But that all very much
depends on you, Mr.Cortez.

678
00:57:44,892 --> 00:57:46,130
You sold Mendez the Missile.

679
00:57:46,669 --> 00:57:48,339
No.

680
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:49,547
I gave it to him.

681
00:57:50,047 --> 00:57:53,059
But then, i've given a lot of bad things
to a lot of bad people.

682
00:57:53,059 --> 00:57:54,746
But that does not make me
one of them.

683
00:57:55,614 --> 00:57:57,227
Get dressed, Mr.Cortez.

684
00:57:58,696 --> 00:57:59,742
Allow me..to try and convince you.

685
00:58:01,662 --> 00:58:03,669
I'll turn my back.

686
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:11,686
Welcome, to The Voztech.

687
00:58:11,686 --> 00:58:14,085
The world's premiere space technology..

688
00:58:14,085 --> 00:58:16,485
and weapons manufacturer.

689
00:58:16,485 --> 00:58:18,433
You know, Time Magazine
once called me...

690
00:58:19,384 --> 00:58:21,792
Merchant of dead.
With an assembly line.

691
00:58:22,302 --> 00:58:24,702
But one very special  day,

692
00:58:24,702 --> 00:58:28,647
I began to think bigger.
And now..i've turned science fiction

693
00:58:29,695 --> 00:58:30,884
into science reality.

694
00:58:32,382 --> 00:58:34,782
And this...this is where
we conduct our training exercises.

695
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:36,788
for what?

696
00:58:37,518 --> 00:58:38,911
Our exodus.

697
00:58:38,911 --> 00:58:42,261
When NASA asked me to build them
a new state of the art luxury space station...

698
00:58:42,261 --> 00:58:44,777
I luxuriously told em,
to fuck themselves.

699
00:58:44,777 --> 00:58:45,929
Why you ask?

700
00:58:45,929 --> 00:58:47,889
Well, i've already told one of my young,

701
00:58:47,889 --> 00:58:48,913
It's already up there right now.
Just floating the fuck around,

702
00:58:48,913 --> 00:58:52,469
waiting for me and my people.
To inhabit it.

703
00:58:52,469 --> 00:58:54,176
In fact, Mr.Cortez,
- Machete.

704
00:58:54,176 --> 00:58:55,135
Incidentally, Machete

705
00:58:55,681 --> 00:58:59,551
I plan on moving into my new space pad,
very very soon. Im very excited.

706
00:58:59,551 --> 00:59:01,049
Here, have a heart.

707
00:59:01,049 --> 00:59:02,009
What about the heart?

708
00:59:02,583 --> 00:59:05,212
Well, that's why i'm relocating.
Climb aboard.

709
00:59:10,366 --> 00:59:11,659
Tanks, Missiles..
bread and butter.

710
00:59:11,659 --> 00:59:16,937
These are simple things,
to fund my out of this world, enterprises.

711
00:59:16,937 --> 00:59:18,978
Why Mendez?
- Why?

712
00:59:19,651 --> 00:59:23,299
Well, Bin Laden is dead.
And America has always needed it's boogy man.

713
00:59:23,299 --> 00:59:25,654
So, i created a new one.

714
00:59:25,654 --> 00:59:31,103
Yes, I supplied Senor Mendez,
the fireworks.

715
00:59:31,103 --> 00:59:33,495
But given Mendez aptitude
for the unpredictable.

716
00:59:33,495 --> 00:59:37,016
I left behind one of my man
to keep a press of his process or

717
00:59:37,016 --> 00:59:38,168
lack there of.

718
00:59:38,168 --> 00:59:39,321
What's your plan have to do with me?

719
00:59:39,321 --> 00:59:41,931
I have high hopes for you, Mr.Machete.

720
00:59:41,931 --> 00:59:44,366
Higher than you can mentally ascend to.

721
00:59:49,843 --> 00:59:53,555
Space ship?
- Technically speaking, space shuttle.

722
00:59:53,555 --> 00:59:55,494
Not to mention,
my legacy.

723
00:59:55,494 --> 00:59:57,667
It all started about
six years ago.

724
00:59:57,667 --> 01:00:00,768
I privately funded a sub orbital launch.

725
01:00:00,768 --> 01:00:01,843
I went up, Myself.

726
01:00:02,505 --> 01:00:05,118
Yeah, i'm something of a thrill seeeker
back then.

727
01:00:05,118 --> 01:00:07,882
Before, what i like to call
The Incident.

728
01:00:07,882 --> 01:00:10,447
I was up among the stars

729
01:00:10,447 --> 01:00:12,720
and something inexplicable happened to me.

730
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,456
I saw the future.

731
01:00:14,456 --> 01:00:15,608
I saw the world ending.

732
01:00:15,608 --> 01:00:18,397
It unfolded right before my very eyes.

733
01:00:21,025 --> 01:00:22,729
That's why,
i build this.

734
01:00:22,729 --> 01:00:23,880
We'll board it.

735
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,028
Me and anyone
who wants to join me.

736
01:00:26,028 --> 01:00:27,180
We will take the flight.

737
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:28,332
And when Kingdom comes...

738
01:00:28,332 --> 01:00:29,484
as it truly will.

739
01:00:29,484 --> 01:00:32,539
We will be safe amongst the stars.

740
01:00:32,539 --> 01:00:34,741
Noah had his Ark..
i got mine.

741
01:00:35,701 --> 01:00:37,121
You really believe that?

742
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:40,883
I believed what i've seen.
And luckily for you, sir..

743
01:00:41,748 --> 01:00:44,370
I saw you up there, with me.

744
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:46,019
I see glimpses of what lies ahead

745
01:00:46,683 --> 01:00:49,447
this is a condition i was left with
after the incident.

746
01:00:51,252 --> 01:00:56,531
Speaking of which,
I'd take a step or two back if i were you.

747
01:00:57,348 --> 01:00:58,374
Ever had a Deja Vu?

748
01:00:58,932 --> 01:01:02,925
Last a couple of seconds, right?
Me..it's been two years.

749
01:01:04,951 --> 01:01:07,291
You don't believe me now,
but you will.

750
01:01:07,291 --> 01:01:12,751
Now, if i couldn't see into the future.
Then, how could i've made all this?

751
01:01:13,831 --> 01:01:16,565
Mr.Machete, I present to you...
the arms for tomorrow.

752
01:01:17,326 --> 01:01:22,613
Pick your fancy.

753
01:01:26,042 --> 01:01:27,260
You picked the only one
in the place that's faulty.

754
01:01:29,326 --> 01:01:30,697
I'm sorry, my molecular blaster

755
01:01:31,303 --> 01:01:33,059
doesn't quite work right yet,

756
01:01:33,059 --> 01:01:34,124
keeps turning shit inside out.

757
01:01:36,035 --> 01:01:39,509
Perhaps, this is more your speed anyway.

758
01:01:40,385 --> 01:01:43,033
Retro..yet,
high tech.

759
01:01:43,542 --> 01:01:44,779
Demonstration?

760
01:01:51,347 --> 01:01:54,089
You like it?
- Yes.

761
01:01:54,089 --> 01:01:55,052
It's yours.

762
01:01:55,052 --> 01:01:58,646
Now, Mr.Machete..if i could cut to the..

763
01:01:58,646 --> 01:02:00,178
I'd like to recruit you.

764
01:02:01,292 --> 01:02:04,489
You already have enough men.
-No, not the best. By any means.

765
01:02:04,489 --> 01:02:07,616
How can they be?
When you've dominantly played em yourself.

766
01:02:07,616 --> 01:02:08,573
Demonstration.

767
01:02:09,491 --> 01:02:11,285
Good luck.

768
01:02:44,068 --> 01:02:47,821
Ha..ha, Encore. Encore.

769
01:02:50,002 --> 01:02:52,074
or three.

770
01:02:53,688 --> 01:02:58,699
Genetically engineered super soldiers, you see.

771
01:02:58,699 --> 01:02:59,659
Cloned.

772
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:06,409
Have at 'em.

773
01:03:38,717 --> 01:03:40,191
Just as I predicted!
No match..

774
01:03:41,197 --> 01:03:44,211
For the likes of you.

775
01:03:48,445 --> 01:03:49,518
I've created my clones.

776
01:03:50,029 --> 01:03:52,399
Because where I am going,
I'm going to need my army.

777
01:03:53,331 --> 01:03:56,738
And that poor dead bastard you've met in Mexico.
Zaror? He was my prototype.

778
01:03:57,641 --> 01:04:00,214
But since you've fucked him up
like a special at science fair project.

779
01:04:01,394 --> 01:04:04,332
I'm left to regret my choice.

780
01:04:04,332 --> 01:04:06,351
You still haven't told me,
Why i am here.

781
01:04:06,351 --> 01:04:09,542
I need a stronger speciment from
which to draw on new batch of clone.

782
01:04:09,542 --> 01:04:12,195
So, i was hoping that you,
would be doing me that honour. Sir?

783
01:04:13,135 --> 01:04:14,104
There is only one Machete.

784
01:04:14,787 --> 01:04:16,244
But what if they were more?

785
01:04:17,091 --> 01:04:18,386
What if there was an army with enhanced Machetes?

786
01:04:20,873 --> 01:04:23,173
Machete. Machete, everywhere Machete.

787
01:04:23,173 --> 01:04:26,539
You and I, together?
Will be a force to be recon with.

788
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:35,855
I'm sorry. I may have over reacted.
But then,

789
01:04:35,855 --> 01:04:40,620
numbnuts was about to spill a bottle
of 1787 Chateau LeFrig.

790
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:42,161
No more games.

791
01:04:42,161 --> 01:04:44,087
Disarm him.

792
01:04:44,087 --> 01:04:45,046
- Join me.

793
01:04:45,621 --> 01:04:48,365
Surely, by now..
that i know how all this turns out.

794
01:04:48,365 --> 01:04:50,172
Then, you know i'm taking this.

795
01:04:50,172 --> 01:04:51,053
Oh, and where will you go?

796
01:04:51,793 --> 01:04:54,568
You know, i am the only one
that can disarm it.

797
01:04:54,568 --> 01:04:56,304
I'll find someone else.

798
01:04:56,304 --> 01:04:57,756
Oh, good luck with that.

799
01:04:57,756 --> 01:05:00,805
But i think, there's one more
little thing that you should know.

800
01:05:00,805 --> 01:05:03,007
Mendez wasn't my only Boogey man.

801
01:05:03,592 --> 01:05:06,804
North Korea, Russia..
I have a Mendez everywhere.

802
01:05:07,307 --> 01:05:10,149
And in a matter of an hour,
they're gonna launch on one another.

803
01:05:10,149 --> 01:05:14,661
Throwing the world into,
gargantual, unrecoverable anarchy.

804
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:18,345
The world is fucked.
- Why?

805
01:05:18,345 --> 01:05:22,150
This world must end,
in order for a more perfect one to emerge.

806
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:25,048
You like it or not, Mr.Machete.
You are coming with me.

807
01:05:49,123 --> 01:05:52,148
Damn, you're good.

808
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:53,822
Get that bastard.

809
01:05:53,822 --> 01:05:56,697
Try not to get too many
of yourselves killed in the process.

810
01:06:35,288 --> 01:06:38,200
My molecule blaster just doesn't work
right yet.

811
01:06:39,919 --> 01:06:42,206
Keeps turning shit
inside out.

812
01:08:14,978 --> 01:08:17,955
What took you so long?
- You're lucky, i came at all.

813
01:08:26,406 --> 01:08:28,545
Oh, we'll meet again Mr.Machete.

814
01:08:30,736 --> 01:08:31,915
I have seen it.

815
01:08:34,998 --> 01:08:37,128
We've been tracking you
since the bounty hit the air-wave.

816
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:39,854
Quite a shit storm
you've stirred up down south.

817
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:44,377
I thought i'd tap in.
Can't let you have all the fun.

818
01:08:44,377 --> 01:08:47,333
Hey, I'm sorry about Sartana.

819
01:08:47,333 --> 01:08:49,378
We all are.

820
01:08:49,378 --> 01:08:50,846
She was one of the good ones.

821
01:08:53,589 --> 01:08:55,444
As you can see,
the network has gone full scale.

822
01:08:56,694 --> 01:09:00,610
New and improved.
All 500,000 extractions.

823
01:09:00,610 --> 01:09:03,855
and counting.
When they put up the wall.

824
01:09:03,855 --> 01:09:07,337
We had to up our game.
Find funding...

825
01:09:07,337 --> 01:09:11,053
Now, our reach extends all the way
to Santi tower.

826
01:09:13,301 --> 01:09:15,498
The rules are the same.
You get in, you gotta earn.

827
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:18,435
The monitor remembers
to make sure they're doing their part.

828
01:09:18,984 --> 01:09:20,183
If they are not..

829
01:09:20,827 --> 01:09:22,084
I will deport their asses myself.

830
01:09:26,442 --> 01:09:27,786
Missing..all of them?

831
01:09:28,478 --> 01:09:32,798
MIA - every last one of 'em.
One minute they are tearing ass for the border.

832
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:33,757
The next..

833
01:09:34,565 --> 01:09:35,648
they vanished.

834
01:09:36,148 --> 01:09:37,396
Disappeared,
without a trace.

835
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:40,956
It's like aliens..
abducted by god damn aliens.

836
01:09:41,879 --> 01:09:43,021
You gotta check this out.

837
01:09:43,866 --> 01:09:49,577
This is the surveilance footage
we got.

838
01:09:50,126 --> 01:09:52,371
We think, the same douchebag that took you.
Took them.

839
01:09:53,044 --> 01:09:54,771
Seems llike he's building some sort
of secret weapon.

840
01:09:55,472 --> 01:09:58,130
Possibly, needing the mexicans labours to finish it.

841
01:09:58,130 --> 01:09:59,088
It's in space.

842
01:09:59,611 --> 01:10:02,013
He wants to get there,
before the missiles take off.

843
01:10:02,013 --> 01:10:03,738
What missiles?
What the fuck are you talking about?

844
01:10:04,813 --> 01:10:07,655
The launch trigger is wired to a biological clock.

845
01:10:07,655 --> 01:10:09,786
We need to find someone
to disarm them.

846
01:10:09,786 --> 01:10:10,831
You got anybody in the network?

847
01:10:12,119 --> 01:10:15,450
- Yeah. But you don't like him.

848
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,504
Osiris!

849
01:10:35,494 --> 01:10:37,747
Come on Machete..He's with us.

850
01:10:37,747 --> 01:10:39,995
- Not with me.
- He's our only bomb guy.

851
01:10:40,515 --> 01:10:41,751
Wanna choke him out, go ahead.

852
01:10:45,775 --> 01:10:47,925
What's he doing here?

853
01:10:49,058 --> 01:10:51,303
- He came to me about six months ago.

854
01:10:51,303 --> 01:10:52,255
Said, he's changed his tune.

855
01:10:52,851 --> 01:10:54,117
Cabron ain't got no tune.

856
01:10:54,694 --> 01:10:59,027
I know that you'd prefer to see me,
with all sorts of dead.

857
01:10:59,027 --> 01:11:00,932
But God has already cursed me
for what i did to Padre.

858
01:11:02,354 --> 01:11:03,669
That's why i am here.

859
01:11:04,716 --> 01:11:06,482
To finish your brother's work.

860
01:11:06,482 --> 01:11:09,198
My only redemption is in
righting that wrong.

861
01:11:09,948 --> 01:11:12,328
Please, give me mercy.
I swear...

862
01:11:12,328 --> 01:11:13,346
I will make it upto you.

863
01:11:14,517 --> 01:11:16,043
- or die, trying.

864
01:11:16,946 --> 01:11:18,087
- i'll have it no other way.

865
01:11:20,027 --> 01:11:23,968
- This is your bomb guy?
- You could try the yellow pages.

866
01:11:28,850 --> 01:11:32,593
You better be at somewhere with a shit
reception b'cos i've been trying to reach you all damn day.

867
01:11:32,593 --> 01:11:33,745
Where is Mendez?
- Dead.

868
01:11:33,745 --> 01:11:36,292
But his heart still beats.

869
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:37,201
- You're joking, right?

870
01:11:37,201 --> 01:11:37,250
Machete, don't joke.

871
01:11:39,275 --> 01:11:42,547
Humour me,
who's got the heart?

872
01:11:42,547 --> 01:11:43,699
- Voz. He is bad news.

873
01:11:43,699 --> 01:11:46,363
Been using Mendez to do all of his dirty works.

874
01:11:46,363 --> 01:11:48,061
- Machete, I'm gonna stop you right there, okay?

875
01:11:48,061 --> 01:11:51,293
Luther Voz may have his hand in
a lot of pockets. But he's harmless.

876
01:11:51,293 --> 01:11:52,963
He sponsors my damn pageant for Christ's sake.

877
01:11:53,502 --> 01:11:55,143
You need to alert the president.

878
01:11:55,143 --> 01:11:57,875
Just calm down.
Tell me your location...

879
01:11:57,875 --> 01:11:59,778
and we'll talk about this in person.

880
01:11:59,778 --> 01:12:00,836
Better be somewhere else.

881
01:12:00,836 --> 01:12:01,969
Have it your way.

882
01:12:01,969 --> 01:12:05,150
I'm gonna text you a rendevous point
after my swimsuit competition.

883
01:12:10,704 --> 01:12:12,298
Who's the bitch?

884
01:12:12,298 --> 01:12:13,181
Handler.

885
01:12:18,278 --> 01:12:19,897
You fucked her?

886
01:12:22,368 --> 01:12:23,193
Yeah, you did.

887
01:12:24,221 --> 01:12:27,185
You got a problem?
- Yeah, i got a problem.

888
01:12:27,185 --> 01:12:28,522
When you smell like pussy...

889
01:12:28,522 --> 01:12:32,797
It makes you a pussy whip.
When you are pussy whipped, your judgement is cloudy.

890
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:34,291
It's just a job.

891
01:12:35,769 --> 01:12:36,748
Is that her?

892
01:12:38,765 --> 01:12:40,128
I thought Machete don't text?

893
01:12:43,205 --> 01:12:45,034
Machete loves everybody.

894
01:12:49,525 --> 01:12:51,705
Where are you going?
- With you.

895
01:12:52,290 --> 01:12:55,061
Takes a bitch,
to make a bitch.

896
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:57,215
And i smell fish taco.

897
01:12:57,215 --> 01:12:58,596
Tito..Osiris?

898
01:13:00,758 --> 01:13:01,794
Taco time.

899
01:13:25,410 --> 01:13:26,493
What'cha know?

900
01:13:27,809 --> 01:13:29,941
.. I won.
- Congratulations.

901
01:13:29,941 --> 01:13:31,055
It's exciting right?

902
01:13:31,055 --> 01:13:32,504
You are looking at the new miss Texas.

903
01:13:33,061 --> 01:13:34,788
Who are they?

904
01:13:34,788 --> 01:13:35,746
Listen, Careno..
I would love to stay and chit chat with you.

905
01:13:37,150 --> 01:13:40,067
But not when there's a live missile
inside state lines.

906
01:13:40,067 --> 01:13:43,443
Would you pretty please, get into the car
and debrief me on your mission.

907
01:13:46,175 --> 01:13:48,055
How did you know?
- Know what?

908
01:13:48,055 --> 01:13:50,792
The missile..that it was here?

909
01:13:50,792 --> 01:13:51,752
Look at you...

910
01:13:53,768 --> 01:13:56,676
smart for an average mexican.

911
01:13:56,676 --> 01:13:58,192
- You work for Voz?

912
01:13:59,133 --> 01:14:02,585
- I promised to turn you over to Voz
and Voz promised me the crown.

913
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:09,722
But i can win.

914
01:14:11,095 --> 01:14:13,619
Oh, Papi i'm sorry.

915
01:14:14,858 --> 01:14:16,594
You and I really could have something.

916
01:14:17,556 --> 01:14:19,369
But i just love
killing a good romance.

917
01:14:22,163 --> 01:14:24,389
Make it count.

918
01:14:48,695 --> 01:14:51,180
I knew i smelled a bitch in there, tonight.

919
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:53,546
Payback is the only bitch
that you need to worry about.

920
01:14:54,169 --> 01:14:56,941
This dress cost more than your fucking life!

921
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:06,116
I always dress to the nine.

922
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:09,945
I dress to kill.

923
01:15:45,547 --> 01:15:49,280
How many man do we got?

924
01:16:42,522 --> 01:16:43,972
This is The President.

925
01:16:43,972 --> 01:16:46,101
Mr.President, this is Miss San Antonio.

926
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:48,434
Machete, never shown up to therendezvous.

927
01:16:48,434 --> 01:16:50,884
I just hope that he is still alive.

928
01:18:26,504 --> 01:18:27,747
Fuck it.

929
01:18:28,887 --> 01:18:33,168
Who am I kidding?

930
01:18:35,357 --> 01:18:38,726
I really must hand it to you, Mi Amigo.

931
01:18:39,917 --> 01:18:41,807
You are a difficult man to catch up with.

932
01:18:42,385 --> 01:18:45,483
You have no idea,
what i went through to get here.

933
01:18:45,483 --> 01:18:48,519
Hours i spend stranded
on the desert highway.

934
01:18:48,519 --> 01:18:50,708
Till this holy rolly break came along.

935
01:18:57,572 --> 01:18:59,972
Lady, please help me.

936
01:18:59,972 --> 01:19:04,581
You and i aren't drug pushing compadres.
You'd just derail my pursuit..

937
01:19:04,581 --> 01:19:08,448
so, frankly..i'm leaning on
the other direction entirely.

938
01:19:08,448 --> 01:19:09,532
Give me mercy.

939
01:19:09,532 --> 01:19:11,933
There's about three things i'd rather give you.

940
01:19:11,933 --> 01:19:14,330
And they are all on the chamber of this gun.

941
01:19:16,458 --> 01:19:19,266
Straight up or with some flare.

942
01:19:20,664 --> 01:19:23,470
Straight up or flare.

943
01:19:23,989 --> 01:19:26,916
Whatever is the more interesting way to die.

944
01:19:32,602 --> 01:19:33,857
Weirdo.

945
01:19:54,342 --> 01:19:57,954
You know, i rather enjoy
my new disguise.

946
01:19:57,954 --> 01:20:00,967
I must apologize for making you dig your
own grave.

947
01:20:04,156 --> 01:20:07,533
But i'm not one for hard labour.
You on the other hand..being mexican and all

948
01:20:08,965 --> 01:20:11,095
You must be used to it.

949
01:20:14,936 --> 01:20:16,499
Holy fucking...

950
01:20:32,195 --> 01:20:35,307
People, did you see a mexican guy?

951
01:20:36,056 --> 01:20:39,826
Drop it. Before i put this thing in your face..

952
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:43,359
You have it all wrong.

953
01:20:44,215 --> 01:20:49,956
This is all a big mistake.
- The only mistake you made was dancing across the border muchacho.

954
01:20:49,956 --> 01:20:52,356
You don't understand.

955
01:20:52,356 --> 01:20:54,365
I am no mexican.

956
01:20:54,365 --> 01:20:55,324
Don't move your hands, amigo.

957
01:20:56,610 --> 01:20:59,692
Sir, really. Listen to my voice.

958
01:20:59,692 --> 01:21:00,514
Do i sound mexican?

959
01:21:01,514 --> 01:21:02,885
I am from Ontario
for fuck's sake.

960
01:21:03,693 --> 01:21:08,815
Canadian and Mexican...
Double whammy.

961
01:21:08,815 --> 01:21:10,500
Let's smoke this fool.

962
01:21:57,560 --> 01:22:00,234
Doc Felix needs to see him right away.
- Machete.

963
01:22:01,070 --> 01:22:02,116
You are back.

964
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:07,444
Sorry about the smell.

965
01:22:07,973 --> 01:22:10,247
Did you know an average person pass
a gas 14 times a day?

966
01:22:10,969 --> 01:22:11,831
It's true.

967
01:22:12,666 --> 01:22:15,681
Our target..Luther Voz.

968
01:22:15,681 --> 01:22:17,966
The same proper fuck who's been jacking our members.

969
01:22:19,042 --> 01:22:22,160
As we speak, he's got a missile pointed
right up our ass.

970
01:22:23,688 --> 01:22:25,664
And since it looks like
no one else is gonna stop him;

971
01:22:27,220 --> 01:22:28,536
It's on us.

972
01:22:28,536 --> 01:22:32,263
Machete's mission with Voz
has nothing to do with us.

973
01:22:32,263 --> 01:22:32,950
We are the network.

974
01:22:33,709 --> 01:22:35,831
Our Mission is Mexico.

975
01:22:35,831 --> 01:22:36,983
Our mission has changed.

976
01:22:36,983 --> 01:22:38,050
He is right.

977
01:22:38,050 --> 01:22:42,203
I am going alone.
- You're not going anywhere, without me Cabron.

978
01:22:42,203 --> 01:22:44,145
No time to argue.

979
01:22:44,145 --> 01:22:45,102
Fuck that.

980
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:49,491
Let me explain something..Miherte.

981
01:22:50,164 --> 01:22:51,709
This isn't about Mexico, no more.

982
01:22:52,459 --> 01:22:53,878
It's about the world.

983
01:22:54,561 --> 01:22:58,499
No world...no Mexico.

984
01:22:58,499 --> 01:22:59,361
Count me in.

985
01:22:59,361 --> 01:22:59,457
Me too...me too.
- Ditto.

986
01:23:03,765 --> 01:23:05,917
VIVA MACHETE!

987
01:23:09,549 --> 01:23:11,449
Looks like it's settled, Machete.

988
01:23:11,449 --> 01:23:12,820
When do we hit him?

989
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:13,874
- Tonight.

990
01:23:21,757 --> 01:23:25,183
-Network one in position.
- network two in position.

991
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:51,721
Ladies and Gentleman, your host...
Mr.Voz.

992
01:24:02,038 --> 01:24:04,508
My fellow travellers, my friends...

993
01:24:04,508 --> 01:24:08,114
I proudly present..
The Millenium One.

994
01:24:08,114 --> 01:24:10,366
Ready to launch right on schedule.

995
01:24:10,366 --> 01:24:11,752
Now, before long...

996
01:24:11,752 --> 01:24:15,895
We'll be transported to heavens
on a maiden voyage of a titanic proportions!

997
01:24:15,895 --> 01:24:17,453
And once, the world is purged.

998
01:24:18,164 --> 01:24:23,482
We'll return to bring about..
A new world..TOGETHER!

999
01:24:28,053 --> 01:24:31,139
In a moment, the boarding process
will begin. But first, my friends...

1000
01:24:31,139 --> 01:24:31,958
prepare for infinity.

1001
01:24:34,169 --> 01:24:36,394
Reveal your new selves to me.

1002
01:24:46,302 --> 01:24:49,651
Why don't you tell them the truth?

1003
01:24:50,526 --> 01:24:51,783
Tell them, you orchestrated all this.

1004
01:24:52,378 --> 01:24:53,568
The missiles, the heart...

1005
01:24:54,433 --> 01:24:58,358
Would someone please.. help the help.
He seems to be lost.

1006
01:24:58,358 --> 01:24:59,106
Tell them, if the world ends.

1007
01:25:00,606 --> 01:25:03,330
You are the one who ended it.

1008
01:25:03,330 --> 01:25:06,289
How can this be?
This isn't supppose to be happening.

1009
01:25:06,289 --> 01:25:07,190
I never saw this.

1010
01:25:08,842 --> 01:25:11,256
Machete happened.

1011
01:25:11,256 --> 01:25:14,074
Look, this is no time for second thoughts.

1012
01:25:14,074 --> 01:25:16,894
The end is near,
I assure you.

1013
01:25:16,894 --> 01:25:18,438
For you.

1014
01:25:19,174 --> 01:25:21,179
Let's do this.

1015
01:25:28,445 --> 01:25:32,620
Well, ladies and gents.. I had hope to have
an unhibited evening. But..

1016
01:25:33,567 --> 01:25:35,558
now it seems..

1017
01:25:35,558 --> 01:25:36,518
Guard!

1018
01:26:09,292 --> 01:26:11,246
What in the fuck is that?

1019
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:15,850
I'm more of a cherry bomb, matchstick kinda guy
you know.

1020
01:26:15,850 --> 01:26:19,466
Semtex..TMT.
50/50 shot on a good day.

1021
01:26:19,466 --> 01:26:20,654
But this..

1022
01:26:34,589 --> 01:26:36,813
Never mind..
we are alive.

1023
01:26:39,543 --> 01:26:41,438
It's a shame. I have to kill you now
Mr.Machete.

1024
01:26:42,910 --> 01:26:44,254
You gotta go.

1025
01:26:46,431 --> 01:26:48,156
Go in style now.

1026
01:27:40,252 --> 01:27:41,783
Well now.. what can i say.

1027
01:27:41,783 --> 01:27:46,073
I suppose, we both
like getting our hands a little dirty.

1028
01:27:54,994 --> 01:27:56,737
You can't beat me, you know?

1029
01:27:56,737 --> 01:27:57,696
I know your every move.

1030
01:27:58,834 --> 01:28:01,233
Even before you do.

1031
01:28:07,991 --> 01:28:09,135
Nobody knows Machete.

1032
01:28:09,836 --> 01:28:12,159
That's true. Ever since, i've met you..

1033
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:14,558
the future has been more unclear. And that,

1034
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:17,639
that puzzles me.

1035
01:28:31,695 --> 01:28:37,818
I assure you i'm every bit
as merciless as what you are..

1036
01:28:37,818 --> 01:28:40,328
Demonstration

1037
01:29:32,654 --> 01:29:34,565
How poetic,

1038
01:29:34,565 --> 01:29:38,000
Now you really are the blind,
leading the blind.

1039
01:30:27,314 --> 01:30:31,047
Alright folks, let's keep it moving.
Form a single file line, one after another.

1040
01:30:31,047 --> 01:30:32,006
Thank you.

1041
01:30:41,598 --> 01:30:44,420
Keep your hands in the strap and hold on tight.

1042
01:31:15,599 --> 01:31:16,944
Really?

1043
01:31:17,933 --> 01:31:19,046
You're gonna make me kill a blind chick?

1044
01:31:21,565 --> 01:31:23,264
The Press could her my crown for that.

1045
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:26,959
That's alright, they will just give it
to the next bimbo, who spreads like virus.

1046
01:31:39,178 --> 01:31:40,876
Alright, darling.

1047
01:31:42,427 --> 01:31:43,557
You wanna tango...

1048
01:31:45,682 --> 01:31:46,975
let's tango.

1049
01:31:46,975 --> 01:31:49,278
Mano-a-mano Motherfucker.

1050
01:31:59,235 --> 01:32:00,533
Watch it now, pussycat.

1051
01:32:00,533 --> 01:32:04,384
That's not a very lady like
kinda thing to say.

1052
01:32:04,384 --> 01:32:06,000
I don't do lady like.

1053
01:32:10,733 --> 01:32:14,828

You're just a regular old cranky bitch , with a PMS.

1054
01:33:28,434 --> 01:33:30,833

1055
01:33:30,833 --> 01:33:36,607
and where oh where might our
mutual aquaintance be at this moment?

1056
01:33:36,607 --> 01:33:39,778
Pissing on your study day,
you're fucked with the wrong mexican.

1057
01:33:39,778 --> 01:33:44,571
Indeed i have. However, in 20 second..
none of them would matter. But you..

1058
01:33:44,571 --> 01:33:47,438
you're still in pickle.
Anyway, you slice it.

1059
01:33:47,438 --> 01:33:49,877
I can't see,
but i can still kick your ass.

1060
01:33:49,877 --> 01:33:52,984
That's why i'm taking you with me.

1061
01:34:21,706 --> 01:34:23,577
This is your captain speaking.

1062
01:34:23,577 --> 01:34:28,798
I apologize in advance for the discomfort
you may experience during our travel.

1063
01:34:28,798 --> 01:34:31,904
But we are unforeseeably overbooked.

1064
01:34:31,904 --> 01:34:33,630

1065
01:34:33,630 --> 01:34:35,858
And try to enjoy the flight.

1066

1068
01:35:32,961 --> 01:35:33,920
We were able to stop the other missiles.

1069
01:35:34,770 --> 01:35:36,368
Where is that son of a bitch, Voz?

1070
01:35:38,428 --> 01:35:44,183
Are you telling me that ...
is out there flipping with weapons and shit?

1071
01:35:44,870 --> 01:35:48,013
I got a wild idea.
Just hear me out.

1072
01:35:48,013 --> 01:35:52,920
