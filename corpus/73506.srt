00:00:24,247 --> 00:00:26,238
(thunderrumb/es)

2
00:01:12,847 --> 00:01:15,964
Don't worry, Billy.
That lightning can't get to us.

3
00:01:16,047 --> 00:01:18,356
You're safe in the car.

4
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:45,164
Had a little engine trouble.
Had to set her down.

5
00:01:45,247 --> 00:01:47,442
I think it's probably a fuel line.

6
00:01:47,527 --> 00:01:49,995
Do you mind giving me a hand?

7
00:01:51,207 --> 00:01:55,917
I'll have it back in the air in a second,
if you'll just help me out.

8
00:01:56,007 --> 00:01:58,077
OK. All right.

9
00:02:00,127 --> 00:02:02,595
You just stay put, Billy.

10
00:02:02,687 --> 00:02:05,679
I'll be right back.

11
00:02:39,247 --> 00:02:41,124
Hold this for me.

12
00:02:55,327 --> 00:02:57,841
No! No!

13
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:01,602
Don't shoot.
What do you want? l got money.

14
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,798
(sorens)

15
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,236
Stay back! l've got the kid!

16
00:03:57,847 --> 00:04:00,281
You're gonna be all right.

17
00:04:00,367 --> 00:04:02,927
I'm a cop.

18
00:04:03,007 --> 00:04:05,965
He won't be hurting anyone else.

19
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:10,843
Need a hand?

20
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:14,839
Hey.

21
00:05:14,927 --> 00:05:16,997
Hey, Officer.

22
00:05:18,687 --> 00:05:23,317
You OK? l heard something on the radio
that you rescued a little boy.

23
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,398
What happened?

24
00:05:25,487 --> 00:05:30,038
Some freak snatched him up
and l tracked him with my plane.

25
00:05:30,127 --> 00:05:32,516
We got him back. Kid's gonna be fine.

26
00:05:32,607 --> 00:05:36,361
That's great,
but you don't seem all that happy.

27
00:05:36,447 --> 00:05:39,245
Things got a little messy out there.

28
00:05:39,327 --> 00:05:42,319
Looks like now l'm a free man.

29
00:05:42,407 --> 00:05:45,365
- You got fired?
- Yeah.

30
00:05:46,687 --> 00:05:48,917
You shot him, Jim?

31
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:51,917
You killed him.

32
00:05:52,007 --> 00:05:58,242
I thought he was going for a gun. I wasn't
sticking around for a confirmation.

33
00:05:58,327 --> 00:06:00,966
Sheriffs calling it "excessive force".

34
00:06:01,047 --> 00:06:04,881
He wanted me to see a shrink again,
but l told him no.

35
00:06:04,967 --> 00:06:10,678
But you can't just go around shootin'
people cos they're wacko.

36
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:16,846
We're not gonna worry about that
any more, are we?

37
00:06:16,927 --> 00:06:21,478
Damn it, Jim. You promised me
you wouldn't do something like this again.

38
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:23,558
Maggie, l know.

39
00:06:24,447 --> 00:06:27,041
You just have to get some help.

40
00:06:27,127 --> 00:06:30,802
Then they'll take you back
or you could do something else.

41
00:06:30,887 --> 00:06:34,516
You've got to get yourself together.
At least try.

42
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:38,964
Maggie, there's nothing
l haven't already tried.

43
00:06:39,047 --> 00:06:41,515
I think we need to take a break.

44
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:49,163
Together, l mean. We'll take some time,
we'll get away for a while.

45
00:06:49,247 --> 00:06:51,715
It'll be good for the both of us.

46
00:06:55,927 --> 00:07:01,320
But if you don't do something, Jim,
l don't know what's gonna happen... to us.

47
00:07:08,847 --> 00:07:10,678
(phone)

48
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:12,644
(answerong machone beeps)

49
00:07:12,727 --> 00:07:17,721
He//o. You've reached Johnson & Esser
Crop-Dustong. P/ease /eave a message.

50
00:07:17,807 --> 00:07:19,798

51
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:33,558
No!

52
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:47,358
(phone)

53
00:08:02,687 --> 00:08:05,997
- Hello?
- Mrs Esteridge. Hi.

54
00:08:06,087 --> 00:08:09,238
- This is Jim Halsey calling.
- Jom/ How the heck are ya?

55
00:08:09,327 --> 00:08:13,161
Fine, thanks. Is the captain available?

56
00:08:13,247 --> 00:08:15,807
You know he is.
Hold on a sec. I'll go get him.

57
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:24,806
Stop your yappin', pal.
Ain't nothin' ever there.

58
00:08:24,887 --> 00:08:27,845
Honey, phone for ya.

59
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:32,558
Honey!

60
00:08:34,087 --> 00:08:36,681
- Bonnie...
- It's Jim Halsey.

61
00:08:42,527 --> 00:08:44,518
Hello there, Jim.

62
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:49,681
- Captain Esteridge, how are you doin'?
- Fine. How are you doin'?

63
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:53,484
Shit. Captain, l'm in a world of hurt here.

64
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:57,276
I screwed up big-time.
I need to talk to you, officer to officer.

65
00:08:57,367 --> 00:09:01,246
To te// you the truth,
/ don't rea//y know why /'m ca//ong.

66
00:09:01,327 --> 00:09:03,921
I don't mean to bother you, sir.

67
00:09:05,687 --> 00:09:10,636
It sounds like this isn't something
we should handle over the phone.

68
00:09:10,727 --> 00:09:14,436
Why don't you come on down and vosot?
Bonnoe and / wou/d /ove to see ya.

69
00:09:14,527 --> 00:09:20,124
- And brong that gor/ you to/d us about.
- There's no way l can come back there.

70
00:09:20,207 --> 00:09:22,277
No way.

71
00:09:22,367 --> 00:09:26,076
Listen, Jim.
This thing's still eatin' you alive.

72
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:31,321
Sometimes the only way to get over
something is to face it straight on.

73
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:33,557
I realise that, sir.

74
00:09:33,647 --> 00:09:37,196
- But l haven't been down there since...
- That's the point.

75
00:09:37,287 --> 00:09:39,847
It's about time. You have to.

76
00:09:48,447 --> 00:09:53,362
Maybe you're right, sir. Maybe comin'
down there would do us some good.

77
00:09:53,447 --> 00:09:56,245
- I know l'm right.
- We'// do ot.

78
00:09:57,047 --> 00:09:59,766
- We'll both come down.
- That's my boy.

79
00:09:59,847 --> 00:10:04,443
You be carefu/ comon' down, cos
there's supposed to be a storm brewon'.

80
00:10:04,527 --> 00:10:07,758
Don't you worry about that.
We're gonna be OK.

81
00:10:07,847 --> 00:10:09,838
Thank you, sir.

82
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:29,797
It ain't Cabo, but at least
it's a change of scenery, right?

83
00:11:30,767 --> 00:11:32,962
Yep.

84
00:11:33,047 --> 00:11:34,719
Let's go.

85
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:17,556
Hello?

86
00:12:21,727 --> 00:12:23,718
(Maggoe) Hello?

87
00:12:26,447 --> 00:12:29,678
Good thing we called ahead, l guess.
Beat the rush(!)

88
00:12:40,087 --> 00:12:42,476
Maybe the keys are in the car.

89
00:13:26,447 --> 00:13:30,645
So you met Captain Esteridge
passing through here?

90
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:33,002
Yep. A long time ago.

91
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:37,043
I had a little car trouble here.
I got stranded.

92
00:13:38,007 --> 00:13:40,316
Captain Esteridge helped me out.

93
00:13:44,247 --> 00:13:47,284
What happened, Jim?

94
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:50,996
Let's just say that
he's the reason l became a cop.

95
00:13:51,087 --> 00:13:53,282
We stayed in touch ever since.

96
00:14:06,127 --> 00:14:07,560
Look out!

97
00:14:18,087 --> 00:14:20,476
My God! That guy almost killed us.

98
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:27,445
This is supposed to be our no-killing trip.

99
00:14:28,647 --> 00:14:31,719
- You OK?
- Yeah. Are you?

100
00:14:31,807 --> 00:14:34,241
I'm OK, l'm OK.

101
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:49,556
(radoo) For those ofyoujust tunong on,
we have a storm a/ert.

102
00:14:49,647 --> 00:14:54,357
There's a heavy wond advosory
from Nocke/ Creek to the county /one.

103
00:14:54,447 --> 00:14:59,316
There are reports of50-60 mph wonds

(Maggoe) Oh, my God.

107
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:27,483
Pull over. They've had an accident.

108
00:15:30,647 --> 00:15:32,956
The car's not there. They've gone for help.

109
00:15:33,047 --> 00:15:37,404
- Somebody could be hurt inside.
- I'm not stopping, Maggie.

110
00:15:39,687 --> 00:15:43,441
Jim, why are you acting like this?
l can't believe you won't pull over.

111
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:47,236
- You're a trained cop.
- There was nobody there.

112
00:16:10,927 --> 00:16:13,316
My God. Is he crazy?

113
00:16:23,287 --> 00:16:25,437
Where'd he go?

114
00:16:41,607 --> 00:16:44,041
- We have to pick him up.
- No.

115
00:16:44,607 --> 00:16:47,405
- Are you crazy? He'll die out here.
- No way.

116
00:16:47,487 --> 00:16:49,079
- Stop!
- No!

117
00:16:55,127 --> 00:16:58,403
We can't leave some guy
stranded out here in a sandstorm.

118
00:16:58,487 --> 00:17:00,876
(startergronds)

119
00:17:06,887 --> 00:17:10,482
- What are you doing?
- Whatever you do, do not let him in here.

120
00:17:22,927 --> 00:17:23,757
Maggie...

121
00:17:36,207 --> 00:17:38,323
Ohh...

122
00:17:45,807 --> 00:17:48,605
Thanks, folks.

123
00:17:48,687 --> 00:17:52,839
Not too many people
pick up a hitchhiker these days.

124
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:57,035
I've been waitin' for ya.

125
00:17:58,887 --> 00:18:03,483
It looks like you took a pretty good spill
back there. You all right?

126
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:06,243
I'm all right.

127
00:18:07,207 --> 00:18:10,040
I'm Maggie, and this is Jim.

128
00:18:10,127 --> 00:18:13,563
Jim. Ain't that somethin'?

129
00:18:13,647 --> 00:18:15,638
I'm Jim, too.

130
00:18:21,527 --> 00:18:24,439
There's a small town
a couple of miles up ahead.

131
00:18:24,527 --> 00:18:29,157
- We'll take you that far, but that's it.
- Sounds good to me, Jimmy.

132
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:32,284
I'm just glad to be alive.

133
00:18:47,607 --> 00:18:52,237
So don't tell me.
I'll bet you're a farm girl, aren't ya?

134
00:18:53,247 --> 00:18:55,363
I used to be.

135
00:18:55,447 --> 00:18:59,042
But the bank took the land,
so l had to find something else to do.

136
00:18:59,127 --> 00:19:02,244
That's me. Always finding
something else to do.

137
00:19:02,327 --> 00:19:05,364
A little bit of this,
a little bit of that.

138
00:19:05,447 --> 00:19:08,837
If l don't keep myself busy,
l'll just... I'll just go crazy.

139
00:19:10,647 --> 00:19:13,844
What do you do for fun?

140
00:19:13,927 --> 00:19:15,997
I fly planes.

141
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:18,043
Crop-duster.

142
00:19:18,127 --> 00:19:20,516
Jim here is a cop.

143
00:19:20,607 --> 00:19:23,838
Got myself a couple of professionals.

144
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:33,206
So, where are we goin' to today?

145
00:19:33,287 --> 00:19:36,563
- We're just...
- None of your business!

146
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,040
My mistake, folks. I'm sorry.

147
00:19:46,287 --> 00:19:50,121
- What are you doin' there, Jimmy?
- I'm gonna get some coffee.

148
00:19:50,207 --> 00:19:53,597
You need somebody to fix your bike,
so we can let you off here.

149
00:19:53,687 --> 00:19:55,917
I'm afraid that's not gonna work.

150
00:19:56,007 --> 00:19:58,601
It's not your call, is it, pal?

151
00:19:59,647 --> 00:20:02,844
Well... It may not be my call,

152
00:20:03,807 --> 00:20:07,925
but l've been waiting for you
for a long, long time.

153
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:20,522
(truck droversounds horn)

154
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:39,440
No! God!

155
00:20:39,527 --> 00:20:44,840
Take your hand out of your jacket,
and get the hell out of my vehicle.

156
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,805
- Son of a bitch.
- Why do you have a gun?

157
00:20:47,887 --> 00:20:49,684
- Jim...
- Get out of the car!

158
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:52,327
- Jimmy, l was just...
- Get out!

159
00:20:52,407 --> 00:20:54,682
- Get out of my car.
- (Maggoe) Jim...

160
00:20:55,247 --> 00:20:58,444
Well, all right.
Thank you for the ride.

161
00:20:59,127 --> 00:21:01,800
Don't take this personal, Jimmy,
but if l were you,

162
00:21:01,887 --> 00:21:06,278
I'd get myself
some serious professional help.

163
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:11,401
Nice to meet you, farm girl.

164
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,043
That guy's psycho.

165
00:21:23,007 --> 00:21:25,043
Jim, what is goin' on with you?

166
00:21:25,127 --> 00:21:28,881
- He had a gun.
- He did not have a gun. You had a gun.

167
00:21:35,047 --> 00:21:39,802
Damned fool. Truck stop's closed.

168
00:21:47,087 --> 00:21:51,205
- Why did you have a gun on vacation?
- He was gonna kill you, then me!

169
00:21:51,287 --> 00:21:54,563
- Did you see a gun?
- I didn't have to!

170
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:58,037
You're starting to scare me.
You're acting crazy.

171
00:21:58,127 --> 00:22:01,119
You're gonna have to trust me on this one.

172
00:22:02,847 --> 00:22:05,236
He definitely had a gun.

173
00:22:07,847 --> 00:22:09,838
(honkong)

174
00:22:50,527 --> 00:22:52,518
(soren)

175
00:23:03,087 --> 00:23:05,555
What are you doing, Jim? Pull over.

176
00:23:06,727 --> 00:23:08,718
Pull over.

177
00:23:39,607 --> 00:23:41,882
Licence and registration.

178
00:23:43,247 --> 00:23:46,876
So, speed racer,
where are you going in such a hurry?

179
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:51,085
We're just passing through here, sir.
Kind of got away from me.

180
00:23:58,287 --> 00:24:02,041
Get out of the car slowly
with your hands up! Both of ya!

181
00:24:02,127 --> 00:24:04,687
- I can explain this.
- Shut up!

182
00:24:06,407 --> 00:24:08,796
Step back
and put your hands on the hood.

183
00:24:08,887 --> 00:24:12,926
- I'm a police officer.
- Police officer. Yeah(!)

184
00:24:32,447 --> 00:24:35,598
Iowa. Where the heck
is that supposed to be?

185
00:24:35,687 --> 00:24:38,281
Not around here.

186
00:24:38,367 --> 00:24:40,801
- Cop, huh?
- I used to be.

187
00:24:40,887 --> 00:24:44,357
Then you should know better
than to carry a concealed weapon.

188
00:24:44,447 --> 00:24:48,998
Both of you stay right where you are
while l call this in.

189
00:25:26,967 --> 00:25:29,925
Billy? ls that you?

190
00:25:31,927 --> 00:25:34,441
Something goin' on here.

191
00:25:34,527 --> 00:25:37,963
I want you to step back
just for a sec, all right?

192
00:25:38,047 --> 00:25:41,323
- What's that?
- Shit.

193
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:45,685
I'm gonna need some backup here.
Pronto, would ya?

194
00:25:47,487 --> 00:25:51,082
Damn it, Billy. I said, stay back.

195
00:26:01,287 --> 00:26:04,996
I said, stay back. I'm dealin' with
a law-enforcement situation.

196
00:26:05,087 --> 00:26:07,317
Hell, so am l.

197
00:26:07,407 --> 00:26:09,682
- Go!
- Freeze!

198
00:26:34,607 --> 00:26:36,723
How you folks been?

199
00:26:40,487 --> 00:26:43,001
Go, go, go, go!

200
00:26:44,047 --> 00:26:46,083
Shit!

201
00:26:46,167 --> 00:26:48,317
Hi, there.

202
00:26:52,767 --> 00:26:55,361
Adoos, farm girl.

203
00:27:03,807 --> 00:27:06,560
Jimmy, l'm so sorry l ever doubted you!

204
00:27:07,647 --> 00:27:10,161
Captain Esteridge
is the only one who can help us.

205
00:27:10,247 --> 00:27:14,445
- I can't believe this is happening!
- It's starting again.

206
00:27:14,527 --> 00:27:16,722
What? What's starting?

207
00:27:16,807 --> 00:27:22,404
About 15 years ago, when l was a kid,
l was driving across country.

208
00:27:22,487 --> 00:27:25,445
I had to deliver a rental car to San Diego.

209
00:27:25,527 --> 00:27:30,157
I drove through here and picked up
a hitchhiker. Son of a bitch was psycho.

210
00:27:30,247 --> 00:27:34,479
He started killing people:
cops, innocent families.

211
00:27:34,567 --> 00:27:36,478
Move over. That guy will kill you.

212
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:39,001
He ko//ed thos gor/ that / knew.

213
00:27:39,887 --> 00:27:43,038
He set me up for it.
He framed me for the killings.

214
00:27:43,127 --> 00:27:46,005
Everybody thought it was me,
except for Esteridge.

215
00:27:46,087 --> 00:27:49,523
He was the only one who believed me.
He helped me out.

216
00:27:49,607 --> 00:27:52,679
They finally caught the son of a bitch.

217
00:27:52,767 --> 00:27:55,839
He escaped. / had to ko// hom.

218
00:28:00,127 --> 00:28:02,846
I shot him dead.

219
00:28:12,087 --> 00:28:15,841
So you think this is the same guy?

220
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:19,078
He doesn't look the same,
but it's him. I know it's him.

221
00:28:45,487 --> 00:28:49,241
- We have to tell the cops everything.
- They won't believe us.

222
00:28:49,327 --> 00:28:54,526
We have to find Esteridge. He's
the only one l trust. Where's that map?

223
00:29:03,447 --> 00:29:05,165
(phone)

224
00:29:05,247 --> 00:29:08,159
Why don't / get that?

225
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,841
Sheriffs office. Deputy Lyle speakin'.

- Who in the hell is this?
- She had a big gun. I saw her.

230
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:35,517
You better get out there.
Who knows what's gonna happen?

231
00:29:42,207 --> 00:29:44,641
Jessop, are you out there?

232
00:29:44,727 --> 00:29:46,319

237
00:30:38,487 --> 00:30:40,478

238
00:30:43,047 --> 00:30:45,038
Cap?

239
00:30:47,087 --> 00:30:49,078
(bord flutters)

240
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:04,395
- Stay here.
- No way.

241
00:31:31,927 --> 00:31:33,326
Cap?

242
00:31:46,527 --> 00:31:48,518

246
00:33:16,207 --> 00:33:18,402
Jim!

247
00:33:18,487 --> 00:33:20,762
We gotta get outta here.

248
00:33:20,847 --> 00:33:23,361
We'll just call for help.

249
00:33:24,327 --> 00:33:26,318
He did this.

250
00:33:39,887 --> 00:33:42,321
Come on.

251
00:33:42,927 --> 00:33:44,280
Jim! Come on.

252
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:48,075
Mrs Esteridge is dead! She's dead!

253
00:34:05,807 --> 00:34:10,085
Whoever's in there,
come out now, with your hands up!

254
00:34:13,007 --> 00:34:17,398
- We'll explain everything.
- What? That we killed everybody?

255
00:34:18,727 --> 00:34:23,198
It's not gonna work, Maggie.
I've been through that before.

256
00:34:23,287 --> 00:34:26,916
We've got to find this son of a bitch
and stop him ourselves.

257
00:34:27,007 --> 00:34:28,998
I'll do it.

258
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:32,358
They'll believe us.

259
00:34:34,287 --> 00:34:36,847
Come out now!

260
00:34:36,927 --> 00:34:38,918
We're coming out!

261
00:34:39,767 --> 00:34:43,760
We'll explain everything. Just don't shoot.

262
00:34:45,527 --> 00:34:46,801
Jim!

263
00:34:50,487 --> 00:34:53,638
Two's company. Three's a crowd.

264
00:34:53,727 --> 00:34:55,843
Sorry, crop-duster.

265
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:56,916
Maggie!

266
00:35:07,367 --> 00:35:10,837
Why'd you have to go and do
a thing like that, Jimmy?

267
00:35:11,687 --> 00:35:15,680
Who am l gonna play with now, l wonder?

268
00:35:18,727 --> 00:35:20,718
What the...?

269
00:35:31,767 --> 00:35:33,678
Jesus.

270
00:35:40,567 --> 00:35:42,239

271
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:57,158
Hold your fire!

272
00:35:59,647 --> 00:36:01,638
Captain Esteridge?

273
00:36:02,647 --> 00:36:04,763
Captain, you in there?

274
00:36:16,847 --> 00:36:18,838
Agh!

275
00:36:36,167 --> 00:36:39,682
Two officers down. We're at
Esteridge's farm. Send backup now.

276
00:36:39,767 --> 00:36:41,962
All hell has broken loose out here.

277
00:36:42,047 --> 00:36:45,244
(woman) /'// send someone out roght away.

278
00:37:03,007 --> 00:37:06,920
We got two suspects -

00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:09,965
fleeing in a black and white Prospector.

280
00:37:10,047 --> 00:37:12,720

Hang on, Jim. Hang on.

Maggie...

284
00:37:25,127 --> 00:37:29,200
You have to kill him. Promise me
you'll kill him, no matter what.

285
00:37:29,287 --> 00:37:30,686
You just hang on.

286
00:37:32,927 --> 00:37:35,999
I'm so sorry, Maggie. I'm so, so sorry.

287
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:57,762
Please, God. Please! (sobs)

298
00:40:40,087 --> 00:40:44,444
- Morning, sunshine.
- You freak. Why are you doing this?!

299
00:40:45,847 --> 00:40:50,398
- Why the heck not?
- You'll never get away with it.

300
00:40:50,487 --> 00:40:53,285
Oh, no?

301
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:56,564
What are you gonna do about it?
Hurt me, from down there?

302
00:40:56,647 --> 00:40:59,241
You just give me the chance!

303
00:40:59,407 --> 00:41:00,806
Nope.

304
00:41:00,887 --> 00:41:04,277
I don't think you got it in ya. Not yet.

00:41:04,607 --> 00:41:07,804
Yeah? Just try me, you bastard!

306

Adoos, Maggie.

307
00:41:10,847 --> 00:41:16,763
Oh, hey, uh... By the way, this structure
looks like it's about ready to go.

308
00:41:16,847 --> 00:41:20,317
I wouldn't make any sudden moves,
if l were you.

309
00:41:34,487 --> 00:41:37,684
Are you still there, you son of a bitch?!

310
00:41:49,767 --> 00:41:51,758
Is anybody here?

311
00:41:53,287 --> 00:41:55,278
Can anybody help?

00:48:10,967 --> 00:48:13,959
What kind of weapons do you have?

320
00:48:19,767 --> 00:48:21,962
Forget it.

321
00:48:41,087 --> 00:48:43,203
I need a phone.

322
00:48:49,047 --> 00:48:51,607

339
00:50:51,767 --> 00:50:54,520
Esteridge was dead when we got there.

340
00:50:54,607 --> 00:50:56,802
Wait, wait!

344
00:51:09,127 --> 00:51:12,199
Just think about
how this looks, you runnin' and all.

345
00:51:12,287 --> 00:51:16,883
We'// c/eara// thos up
before ot gets any worse.

346
00:51:16,967 --> 00:51:19,117
He//o?

347
00:51:19,207 --> 00:51:22,961
- You sto// there?
- OK. I'll meet you.

348
00:51:24,647 --> 00:51:29,004
I'm... I'm at the Lone Wolf Trading Post.

349
00:51:29,087 --> 00:51:32,716
/ know the p/ace.
/'// meet you there on about 15 monutes.

350
00:51:32,807 --> 00:51:36,925
- Alone, right?
- A/one.

351
00:51:42,447 --> 00:51:48,124
We just got another call. Something bad's
happening at the Trading Post.

352
00:51:49,407 --> 00:51:50,806
Let's go.

353
00:52:30,167 --> 00:52:32,158
(doorbangs)

354
00:53:35,127 --> 00:53:37,118
Thanks.

355
00:54:09,487 --> 00:54:11,478
(doorbangs)

356
00:54:15,247 --> 00:54:17,238
Hello?

357
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,918
(screams)

358
00:54:36,047 --> 00:54:38,038
Agh!

359
00:54:38,887 --> 00:54:41,401
(# "You Must Be An Ange/")

360
00:55:06,367 --> 00:55:08,358
(doorbangs)

361
00:55:22,647 --> 00:55:25,559
What can l get you today, missy?

362
00:55:25,647 --> 00:55:29,640
Go ahead. Take a load off. Have a seat.

363
00:55:34,287 --> 00:55:38,439
I'm really glad you could
come by and visit us today.

364
00:55:38,527 --> 00:55:40,882
Now then, what do we have?

365
00:55:41,967 --> 00:55:44,959
Some beefjerky. Oh! Scratch that.

366
00:55:45,927 --> 00:55:50,603
We're out of the damned jerky.
Just gonna have to have beans today.

367
00:55:50,687 --> 00:55:54,919
Why? Why are you doin' this?

368
00:55:55,007 --> 00:55:58,283
Sometimes you just get
tired of watchin' television.

369
00:55:58,367 --> 00:56:01,404
So l decided to take up this cookin'.

370
00:56:06,127 --> 00:56:08,243
Everything all right here?

371
00:56:10,447 --> 00:56:14,998
- Where's Nathan?
- He's out back. He's coolin' off.

372
00:56:15,087 --> 00:56:18,557
- Why don't you take a seat?
- Get outta here, now.

373
00:56:18,647 --> 00:56:20,444
Go!

374
00:56:21,447 --> 00:56:25,360
Damn, woman. Do you know
how hard it is to build a customer base

375
00:56:25,447 --> 00:56:27,802
in this kind of a town?

376
00:56:27,887 --> 00:56:30,481
Turn around.

377
00:56:34,647 --> 00:56:38,117
Can l at least get me some pie
before you chop me up

378
00:56:38,207 --> 00:56:43,201
in front of your sheriff friend
who, l suspect, will be here momentarily.

379
00:56:52,127 --> 00:56:56,405
Who do you think
they're gonna believe, farm girl?

380
00:57:01,687 --> 00:57:04,440
- What are you?
- Watch now.

381
00:57:08,407 --> 00:57:09,920
Agh!

382
00:57:14,887 --> 00:57:21,235
Ohh! Sheriff, look what she done to me.
And l use that finger, too.

383
00:57:24,447 --> 00:57:26,836
Bam! Kickin' it up a notch.

384
00:57:26,927 --> 00:57:31,717
See, l just called the sheriff myself
a couple of minutes ago.

385
00:57:31,927 --> 00:57:34,646
Yeah... Problem with the counterman.

386
00:57:36,607 --> 00:57:41,601
Seems some crazy farm girl came in
and messed him up real good.

387
00:57:41,687 --> 00:57:43,279
(sorens)

388
00:57:59,007 --> 00:58:02,761
Ma'am, if you're in there,
l'm glad that you are.

389
00:58:02,847 --> 00:58:05,122
I need you to come on out now.

390
00:58:06,887 --> 00:58:09,276
I know we had an understanding.

391
00:58:09,367 --> 00:58:14,361
Since then we got a report of trouble
out here, so l got to treat it that way.

392
00:58:14,447 --> 00:58:16,756
He sounds like a reasonable fella.

393
00:58:16,847 --> 00:58:19,156
Come out. Everything will be OK.

394
00:58:19,247 --> 00:58:23,081
We know about the trouble
with your boyfriend Jim.

395
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:27,126
Sounds like he's tryin'
to work with ya there.

396
00:58:27,207 --> 00:58:32,327
You are not gettin' away again,
you sorry son of a bitch.

397
00:58:32,407 --> 00:58:38,437
Maggie... I don't keep bullets
in that particular gun. Safety thing.

398
00:58:42,767 --> 00:58:44,723
(c/ock)

399
00:58:47,207 --> 00:58:50,882
I do, however, keep this one down here...

400
00:58:52,367 --> 00:58:55,803
fully loaded and prepared at all times.

401
00:59:09,647 --> 00:59:10,636
Catch.

402
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:40,483
- Lyle, get around back.
- You got it.

403
00:59:50,207 --> 00:59:52,004
You freeze now!

404
00:59:52,087 --> 00:59:55,682
The woman's crazy. You've gotta
arrest her. Look what she did to me.

405
01:00:05,127 --> 01:00:07,118
Hold your fire.

406
01:00:08,447 --> 01:00:10,597
Freeze!

407
01:00:10,687 --> 01:00:14,600
That's her. She's the one, right there.
She did this to me.

408
01:00:14,687 --> 01:00:16,803
Drop your gun. Do it!

409
01:00:18,647 --> 01:00:20,638
She's psycho. I know it.

410
01:00:34,927 --> 01:00:36,918
I ran to get out.

411
01:00:39,127 --> 01:00:41,436
You arrested me.

412
01:00:41,527 --> 01:00:43,995
You recognise this?

413
01:00:48,007 --> 01:00:50,919
Yes... It's mine.

414
01:00:52,167 --> 01:00:54,362
He took it. Jim.

415
01:00:55,487 --> 01:00:57,478
Well... Hm?

416
01:01:01,247 --> 01:01:03,841
That man's name is Jack, Maggie.

417
01:01:03,927 --> 01:01:06,999
Jim's your boyfriend, and he's dead.

418
01:01:09,327 --> 01:01:12,125
He told us his name was Jim.

419
01:01:15,607 --> 01:01:18,599
You don't believe any of this, do you?

420
01:01:19,327 --> 01:01:21,124
I don't know, Maggie.

421
01:01:23,647 --> 01:01:27,925
- Who the hell is he?
- You don't know?

422
01:01:29,767 --> 01:01:31,758
I have no idea.

423
01:01:35,487 --> 01:01:40,561
Now, Jack... When you went into the café,
she was behind the counter?

424
01:01:40,647 --> 01:01:45,277
Yes, sir. I thought
she worked there, you know, and...

425
01:01:45,367 --> 01:01:50,885
Then she started actin' all nervous
and her eyes started dartin' around.

426
01:01:50,967 --> 01:01:53,959
I don't know.
She was just acting kinda creepy.

427
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:59,360
- And you didn't see the counterman?
- No. No, sir. Not then.

428
01:01:59,887 --> 01:02:02,606
- And she pulled a gun on you?
- Yeah. Well, yeah...

429
01:02:02,687 --> 01:02:07,203
She told me to come behind the counter.
That's when l saw the counterman.

430
01:02:07,287 --> 01:02:09,482
Well, the counterman's body.

431
01:02:09,567 --> 01:02:13,924
Then she told me to move it for her. I said
"No way. I ain't movin' no dead body."

432
01:02:14,007 --> 01:02:18,762
I ain't touchin' no dead body, layin' there,
blood on the floor. I can't do it.

433
01:02:18,847 --> 01:02:22,726
- And then she cut you?
- She was holdin' the gun to my head.

434
01:02:22,807 --> 01:02:25,480
Then she pulled out a tomahawk,
of all things,

435
01:02:25,567 --> 01:02:27,797
and chopped off my finger.

436
01:02:28,967 --> 01:02:33,438
All l wanted was some pie.
All l wanted was a piece of pie.

437
01:02:33,527 --> 01:02:35,916
Yeah. They're, uh, good pies.

438
01:02:36,927 --> 01:02:40,237
What happened when the officers arrived?

439
01:02:41,247 --> 01:02:43,636
Well, um...

440
01:02:43,727 --> 01:02:45,763
They talked real nice to her.

441
01:02:45,847 --> 01:02:48,281
Then she just opened fire on 'em.

442
01:02:48,367 --> 01:02:50,927
Right through the window.
Busted it, too.

443
01:02:51,007 --> 01:02:54,204
- Are you sure she fired first?
- Yes, sir. Most definitely.

444
01:02:54,287 --> 01:02:56,198
That's when you ran?

445
01:02:56,287 --> 01:02:59,165
Like a red-headed stepchild.
I had to get outta Dodge.

446
01:02:59,247 --> 01:03:03,365
One unbalanced lady. She cut off
my finger, turned it into fried bread.

447
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:08,726
I hope she burns in hell for
what she did to me and those officers.

448
01:03:10,007 --> 01:03:12,567
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for the language.

449
01:03:14,167 --> 01:03:16,362
It's just the way l feel.

450
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:19,766
Thank you, Jack.

451
01:03:19,847 --> 01:03:22,566
Deputy, would you uncuff him, please?

452
01:03:28,447 --> 01:03:30,642
Ah! Whoo.

453
01:03:31,927 --> 01:03:33,565
Thank you very much.

454
01:03:33,647 --> 01:03:39,404
Hey, um... You think l can get me
one of them bear-claw thingies?

455
01:03:39,487 --> 01:03:41,045
Sure. Of course.

456
01:03:46,887 --> 01:03:50,243
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.

457
01:03:52,607 --> 01:03:55,121
Scum.

458
01:03:56,047 --> 01:03:59,039
Scum in a real pretty wrapper.

459
01:03:59,127 --> 01:04:04,485
I don't know. The boyfriend might have
cracked and drove her over the edge.

460
01:04:04,567 --> 01:04:06,797
Might have cracked?

461
01:04:06,887 --> 01:04:10,596
Did you read the report sent in
by his sheriff boss back in lowa?

462
01:04:10,687 --> 01:04:14,919
I just don't see this woman
cuttin' off a guy's finger like that.

463
01:04:15,007 --> 01:04:17,885
For God's sake, Sheriff, add it up.

464
01:04:18,767 --> 01:04:21,725
She had the gun
that killed the people in that trailer.

465
01:04:21,807 --> 01:04:25,322
That same gun killed
Mrs Esteridge and Jess.

466
01:04:25,407 --> 01:04:30,401
Then she shows up drivin'
the dead trucker's 18-wheeler?

467
01:04:30,487 --> 01:04:34,196
The girl had gunpowder on her hands!

468
01:04:35,287 --> 01:04:39,883
The weapon that was used to ko//
Nathan had herpronts a// overot.

469
01:04:39,967 --> 01:04:45,041
And she odentofiied the neck/ace
that we found on Jess's cruoser.

470
01:04:45,127 --> 01:04:50,155
Fona//y, we have an eyewotness
who she kodnapped back on the café.

471
01:04:50,247 --> 01:04:54,525
The poors/ob's on/y /ucky
that she dodn't ko// hom too.

472
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:58,196
She snapped all right.

473
01:04:58,287 --> 01:05:00,357
Look, Lieutenant...

474
01:05:01,367 --> 01:05:06,316
She's got no record. She's got her own
crop-dusting business. She seems...

475
01:05:06,407 --> 01:05:11,322
You just think
that a woman couldn't do this.

476
01:05:12,487 --> 01:05:14,523
Ain't that right?

477
01:05:16,727 --> 01:05:22,359
Well, that, Sheriff,
is prejudice right there.

478
01:05:22,447 --> 01:05:25,280
And it ain't fair.

479
01:05:25,367 --> 01:05:32,842
The state of Texas just executed a woman
who killed two people with a pickaxe.

480
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:37,796
And, besodes, no guy's gonna
cut offhos own fiinger. No way.

481
01:05:38,887 --> 01:05:43,119
We have enough evodence
that the peop/e here wo// start cheerong

482
01:05:43,207 --> 01:05:46,324
ofwe ko// her our own damned se/ves/

483
01:05:46,927 --> 01:05:48,918
Yeah, l know.

484
01:05:49,687 --> 01:05:51,678
That's what bothers me.

485
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:01,678
- Where is he?
- In the hospital, being tended to.

486
01:06:01,767 --> 01:06:06,841
- Don't worry. He'll be around to testify.
- Don't leave him alone. He'll get away.

487
01:06:06,927 --> 01:06:09,441
He's the one who did all this.

488
01:06:09,527 --> 01:06:13,281
He is the victim, darlin', that poor man.

489
01:06:13,367 --> 01:06:18,361
Around here, we don't like people who
shoot cops and butcher Texas Rangers.

490
01:06:18,447 --> 01:06:20,517
Now shut your mouth.

491
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:27,397
- He's gonna come back. He's not through.
- But you sure the heck are.

492
01:06:28,967 --> 01:06:30,958
One question.

493
01:06:32,087 --> 01:06:36,763
up at Esteridge's, were either
of you ever up in the hayloft?

494
01:06:37,767 --> 01:06:39,758
No.

495
01:06:43,447 --> 01:06:45,438
Wait.

496
01:06:46,807 --> 01:06:48,877
Yeah?

497
01:06:48,967 --> 01:06:50,844
Do you believe me at all?

498
01:06:57,727 --> 01:06:59,922
Yeah, l'll be there, Maggie.

499
01:07:00,007 --> 01:07:02,726
Try not to worry. I'll talk to the judge.

500
01:07:02,807 --> 01:07:06,720
We'll have plenty of time
to figure this all out.

501
01:07:06,807 --> 01:07:08,798
Thank you.

502
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:16,438
Like hell he will.

503
01:07:32,847 --> 01:07:38,080
She's runnin' low. I'm just gonna take her
round back and tank her up for ya.

504
01:07:38,167 --> 01:07:41,159
Damn it. Hurry it on up, Lyle.

505
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:47,157
You wouldn't happen to have any of them
bear-claw things on you, would you?

506
01:09:32,407 --> 01:09:35,080
Don't do anything l wouldn't do.

507
01:10:06,007 --> 01:10:09,761
Maggie... Please. Drop the gun.

508
01:10:10,967 --> 01:10:13,879
It's him. It's him. He's here.

509
01:10:13,967 --> 01:10:16,003
Drop the gun, Maggie.

510
01:10:17,407 --> 01:10:20,604
I can get you help. That's all you need.

511
01:10:21,167 --> 01:10:24,364
It's all under control, Sheriff.
You can take a load off.

512
01:10:27,527 --> 01:10:29,518
(screams)

513
01:10:42,327 --> 01:10:44,318
(c/ockong)

514
01:11:27,407 --> 01:11:29,398
(uronatong)

515
01:11:42,047 --> 01:11:44,845
That's a nice truck you got there.

516
01:11:46,807 --> 01:11:49,526
Yeah, l guess.

517
01:13:02,647 --> 01:13:05,719
- I'd better phone the sheriff.
- I think you'd better.

518
01:13:13,687 --> 01:13:16,247
She did what?

519
01:13:16,327 --> 01:13:20,764
I know who she is.
We will get your plane back.

520
01:13:45,407 --> 01:13:47,125
No. No.

521
01:14:03,927 --> 01:14:06,521
I'm right behind you.

522
01:14:11,887 --> 01:14:14,321
There you are.

523
01:14:53,287 --> 01:14:54,606
Son of a bitch.

524
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:31,285
Son of a bitch!

525
01:16:43,447 --> 01:16:44,596
Shit! Shit!

526
01:16:47,447 --> 01:16:49,039
(gauge b/eepong)

527
01:16:49,127 --> 01:16:50,401
(engone sputters)

528
01:17:10,767 --> 01:17:12,837
That's my girl.

529
01:18:30,927 --> 01:18:32,485
(e/ectrocoty crack/es)

530
01:20:17,327 --> 01:20:20,364
What's goin' on, farm girl?

531
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:26,038
Jim told me about that poor girl
and the way that she died.

532
01:20:26,607 --> 01:20:31,362
So l thought that maybe
you would like a taste of that yourself.

533
01:20:31,447 --> 01:20:35,884
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
It wasn't me.

534
01:20:35,967 --> 01:20:38,356
It was someone exactly like you.

535
01:20:38,447 --> 01:20:42,440
- Don't go talkin' all crazy on me now.
- Who the hell are you?

536
01:20:42,527 --> 01:20:46,486
I was just drivin' my gasoline truck
when you came along.

537
01:20:47,527 --> 01:20:49,404
I said, who the hell are you?!

538
01:20:50,287 --> 01:20:52,847
What?

539
01:20:52,927 --> 01:20:55,077
And spoil all the fun?

540
01:20:56,767 --> 01:20:58,598
Goodbye, Jack.

541
01:20:59,487 --> 01:21:03,241
You don't got it in ya, Maggie. Not yet.

542
01:21:45,407 --> 01:21:47,125
No!

543
01:21:47,447 --> 01:21:49,165
Freeze!

544
01:21:51,287 --> 01:21:52,766
Argh! Argh!

545
01:21:55,607 --> 01:21:58,201
Thank God you fellas are here.
She's crazy.

546
01:21:58,287 --> 01:22:01,962
She cut off my finger,
knocked me out and tied me up.

547
01:22:02,047 --> 01:22:04,845
The bitch won't quit! Look at her!

548
01:22:04,927 --> 01:22:06,121
No!

549
01:22:06,207 --> 01:22:08,562
I can't tell you how much
l thank you fellas of the law.

550
01:22:08,647 --> 01:22:10,444
No! He'll kill you!

551
01:22:10,527 --> 01:22:15,317
Thank you so much.
I appreciate you guys helping me out.

552
01:22:19,887 --> 01:22:20,842
No!

553
01:22:37,527 --> 01:22:39,518
Are you still scared?

554
01:22:44,367 --> 01:22:46,676
What a shame.

555
01:22:52,687 --> 01:22:55,076
We came so close.

556
01:22:58,007 --> 01:23:01,124
And l thought we had an understanding.

557
01:23:05,687 --> 01:23:08,997
I'm not scared.

558
01:23:09,087 --> 01:23:12,841
I just don't wanna get burned again.
