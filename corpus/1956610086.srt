00:03:47,772 --> 00:03:50,460
<i>Brian, Peggy...
Your song again.</i>

2
00:03:50,707 --> 00:03:53,570
<i>Hey, we should make that
the official project anthem.</i>

3
00:03:53,883 --> 00:03:55,933
<i>We're with you out there.
In spirit.</i>

4
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,690
<i>Congratulations.
And good luck.</i>

5
00:04:10,754 --> 00:04:12,311
You okay, sweetie?

6
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,860
Take a deep breath.

7
00:04:18,444 --> 00:04:19,856
Okay.

8
00:04:21,981 --> 00:04:24,727
<i>Okay, Brian, we're ready
to start this final countdown.</i>

9
00:04:26,489 --> 00:04:28,970
<i>T-minus 90 seconds
and counting.</i>

10
00:04:30,523 --> 00:04:33,430
<i>Brian, are you and Peggy
hooked up to the accelerator?</i>

11
00:04:33,488 --> 00:04:36,762
- Yes.
- <i>Alright, it's time to administer your injections.</i>

12
00:04:36,926 --> 00:04:37,999
Okay.

13
00:04:44,387 --> 00:04:45,657
<i>All set, kids?</i>

14
00:04:45,987 --> 00:04:48,034
- Y-yeah, hold on.
- <i>Alright, here we go.</i>

15
00:04:48,143 --> 00:04:50,400
<i>Now there's no turning back;
we're committed.</i>

16
00:04:52,802 --> 00:04:56,202
Okay, Brian, Peggy...
Very soon. Ready now. Ready.

17
00:04:59,042 --> 00:05:00,654
<i>Good luck, mein children.</i>

18
00:05:00,736 --> 00:05:02,155
I love you.

19
00:05:03,184 --> 00:05:04,794
<i>God be with you.</i>

20
00:05:07,315 --> 00:05:09,162
<i>T-minus 60 seconds.</i>

21
00:05:13,049 --> 00:05:15,147
Goggles on. Last chance.

22
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:30,894
<i>T-minus 30... 29... 28...</i>

23
00:05:30,991 --> 00:05:35,175
<i>27... 26... 25... 24...</i>

24
00:05:35,363 --> 00:05:39,548
<i>23... 22... 21... 20...</i>

25
00:05:39,801 --> 00:05:44,137
<i>19... 18... 17... 16...</i>

26
00:05:44,396 --> 00:05:46,160
Brian! I'm so scared!

27
00:05:46,277 --> 00:05:49,217
It's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fine.

28
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,876
- I did it for us, baby.
- <i>9... 8... 7...

29
00:05:53,088 --> 00:05:55,608
- I love you.
- I love you too.

30
00:05:55,796 --> 00:06:00,091
<i>5... 4... 3... 2...</i>

31
00:06:00,551 --> 00:06:02,737
<i>One... zero.</i>

32
00:06:06,068 --> 00:06:08,939
Come on, come on.
God dammit!

33
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:19,721
Something's wrong.
It's gotta be a misfire.

34
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,972
Check the firing circuits.
It's probably the detonator.

35
00:06:50,223 --> 00:06:52,601
- Brian!
- Don't look at it!

36
00:06:53,828 --> 00:06:55,394
Don't look at it!

37
00:07:07,425 --> 00:07:09,758
<i>A new tool
has been given mankind.<i>

38
00:07:09,953 --> 00:07:13,682
<i>But in the wrong hands, one of
unimaginable destructive power.</i>

39
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,472
<i>And that is why we must remain
ever vigilant, ever prepared.<i>

40
00:07:17,725 --> 00:07:19,213
<i>Project Sampson!</i>

41
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:23,280
<i>This shelter's guaranteed to take
the anxiety out of the atomic age.</i>

42
00:07:23,494 --> 00:07:27,109
<i>Modern atomic technologies has
made sure it's got it all:</i>

43
00:07:27,223 --> 00:07:30,091
<i>Special air filtration
and circulating systems,</i>

44
00:07:30,177 --> 00:07:32,650
<i>food and survival supplies
for seven days,</i>

45
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,533
<i>and can this baby take it!</i>

46
00:07:34,602 --> 00:07:37,935
<i>Reinforced steel.
6 inches of corrugated lead.</i>

47
00:07:38,037 --> 00:07:41,598
<i>3 feet of concrete,
and 20 feet underground.</i>

48
00:07:41,683 --> 00:07:46,595
<i>It can a near direct hit from a 10 megaton
hydrogen bomb and laugh it off.</i>

49
00:07:48,054 --> 00:07:51,934
<i>All that, and a new anti-radiation
project so top secret,</i>

50
00:07:52,049 --> 00:07:54,819
<i>even the President
has to ask for clearance.</i>

51
00:07:54,893 --> 00:07:57,415
<i>That's how we build them
in the U.S. of A...</i>

52
00:07:57,505 --> 00:08:00,863
<i>Strong. Strong enough
to protect the heroes of our story.</i>

53
00:08:00,966 --> 00:08:03,768
<i>National heroes,
Brian and Peggy Bell,</i>

54
00:08:03,848 --> 00:08:08,314
<i>just 20 feet underground and
200 yards away from the Samson tower.</i>

55
00:08:10,578 --> 00:08:15,276
<i>Meet Brian and Peggy Bell,
America's first nuclear family.</i>

56
00:08:15,316 --> 00:08:18,262
<i>American heroes
for America's future.</i>

57
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,604
<i>Brian and Peggy are the most
important part of the patriotic team,</i>

58
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,038
<i>leading the way
in peacetime testings,</i>

59
00:08:24,194 --> 00:08:29,283
<i>to produce jobs, insure our security,
and harness the power of the atom.</i>

60
00:08:34,378 --> 00:08:37,265
<i>And comes the day,
the day of Samson,</i>

61
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,465
<i>and Brian and Peggy
ride the nuclear storm for us,</i>

62
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,447
<i>to make our future safe.</i>

63
00:08:46,434 --> 00:08:50,632
<i>Cleansing process complete.
No signs of radiant energy.</i>

64
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:54,134
<i>Success!
And America moves forward again.</i>

65
00:08:54,232 --> 00:08:57,282
<i>In the forefront
of technology and progress.</i>

66
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:08,578
<i>And what of Brian and Peggy?
What about the heroes of our story?</i>

67
00:09:08,643 --> 00:09:12,444
<i>It's off to their new home
and new life in Phoenix, Arizona,</i>

68
00:09:12,624 --> 00:09:16,201
<i>where Brian will continue
his important work in atomic research,</i>

69
00:09:16,384 --> 00:09:18,689
<i>while Peggy sets up housekeeping.</i>

70
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,747
<i>So long, Brian and Peggy.
America salutes you.</i>

71
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:46,904
- Thank you, Major.
- The latest tests are negative!

72
00:09:47,411 --> 00:09:49,832
Absolutely no trace of mercury.

73
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,513
And the level of radiation
in the bone marrow-

74
00:09:52,624 --> 00:09:56,059
-is completely within
the normal range!

75
00:09:57,141 --> 00:10:00,446
Clean isolation period
is over!

76
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:03,084
- The vaccine worked!
- Well, that was excellent.

77
00:10:03,175 --> 00:10:07,376
<i>That was just outstanding. You know,
we're very, very proud of you two.</i>

78
00:10:07,584 --> 00:10:10,056
<i>And you're gonna be
very famous in the near future.</i>

79
00:10:10,678 --> 00:10:14,970
<i>This little news reel has an unprecedented
release, ladies and gentleme,</i>

80
00:10:15,004 --> 00:10:18,639
in 1500 theaters
from coast to coast.

81
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,462
Ladies and gentlemen,
join me, please.

82
00:10:22,485 --> 00:10:26,832
in a toast...
to Brian and Peggy...

83
00:10:26,985 --> 00:10:30,523
...America's first nuclear family.

84
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,677
It's gonna be great, baby.

85
00:11:18,739 --> 00:11:21,100
Brian, Peggy...
Why don't you come with me?

86
00:11:21,177 --> 00:11:23,315
There's somebody over there
I'd like very much for you to meet.

87
00:11:23,402 --> 00:11:25,043
- Yes, sir.
- Right this way.

88
00:11:29,525 --> 00:11:32,407
- Now, you know the General?
- Yes, sir, General.

89
00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:36,619
Mr. and Mrs. Bell, may I
present Lewis Olander.

90
00:11:36,787 --> 00:11:39,074
He's the chairman of
Modern Atomic Technologies,

91
00:11:39,206 --> 00:11:41,556
and Brian, that makes him
your new boss.

92
00:11:41,587 --> 00:11:42,587
How do you do?

93
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:45,371
Very well, thank you.
Very well.

94
00:11:47,653 --> 00:11:51,594
How in God's name
could she get pregnant?

95
00:11:53,151 --> 00:11:55,314
You put a man and a woman
alone underground,

96
00:11:55,324 --> 00:11:58,162
what do you expect them
to do, play Parcheesi?

97
00:11:58,904 --> 00:12:01,477
I don't think that's
the issue any longer.

98
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:05,016
The question at hand is:
What do we do about it?

99
00:12:05,211 --> 00:12:06,832
You mean an abortion?

100
00:12:08,576 --> 00:12:09,906
I don't know.

101
00:12:11,102 --> 00:12:13,612
That makes me
awfully uneasy.

102
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,022
I think it's probably advisable,
under the circumstances.

103
00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:25,732
Mr. Orlander?

104
00:12:26,976 --> 00:12:28,814
What do you think?

105
00:12:40,118 --> 00:12:42,155
A beautiful boy.

106
00:12:50,824 --> 00:12:52,043
Oh!

107
00:12:53,704 --> 00:12:57,061
- Oh, honey, you did it!
- Brian, he is so beautiful.

108
00:12:57,111 --> 00:12:59,915
Well, what'd you expect?
Look at his mom.

109
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:03,949
God, look at this room!
Where'd all this come from?

110
00:13:04,561 --> 00:13:07,135
Guess we have
a lot of friends, huh? Hi.

111
00:13:08,838 --> 00:13:11,773
Well... here's mine.

112
00:13:12,869 --> 00:13:15,792
- And they are the most beautiful.
- Oh, darling.

113
00:13:17,894 --> 00:13:19,370
How ya doin',
you doin' okay?

114
00:13:19,435 --> 00:13:22,733
- Oh, yes.
- You look wonderful.

115
00:13:24,566 --> 00:13:26,447
I love you so much.

116
00:13:28,105 --> 00:13:29,571
What's in the red box?

117
00:13:30,631 --> 00:13:32,584
This is David's first present.

118
00:13:38,998 --> 00:13:40,544
Brian!

119
00:13:41,758 --> 00:13:44,691
- It is so beautiful!
- Wait, look at this.

120
00:13:48,802 --> 00:13:51,314
Isn't it amazing
what they're dong with plastic?

121
00:14:07,727 --> 00:14:09,332
Oh, Brian.

122
00:14:28,628 --> 00:14:33,338
His, uh, vital signs are all perfect.
There's no signs of radiation, and, uh,

123
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,719
he's running a fever, though.
About 100 degrees.

124
00:14:35,776 --> 00:14:37,352
Is that anything
to worry about, Doctor?

125
00:14:37,388 --> 00:14:41,137
No, not really, it's, uh, probably
just a low-grade infection.

126
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,964
We'll have him watched.

127
00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:46,259
Some people actually have
permanently high temperatures,

128
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,835
he could just be one of those.

129
00:14:47,981 --> 00:14:49,887
Is that a bruise
on the child's hand?

130
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:53,873
It's a birthmark. Actually, it's the
only abnormality we could find.

131
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:57,569
- It's a perfect circle.
- A perfect abnormality.

132
00:14:57,671 --> 00:14:59,166
Looks like a tattoo!

133
00:15:00,987 --> 00:15:02,910
Well, it's August 6th.

134
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:06,086
It's a helluva birthday for
that little guy, isn't it?

135
00:15:06,307 --> 00:15:07,591
What do you mean?

136
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,896
Well, Doctor, today
is the 10th anniversary

137
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,061
of the day we dropped
the bomb on Hiroshima.

138
00:15:13,202 --> 00:15:14,564
That's pretty funny, ain't it?

139
00:15:27,615 --> 00:15:29,530
Let's go see your mommy.

140
00:15:43,846 --> 00:15:48,405
♪ Sleep, baby,
sleep in my arms. ♪

141
00:15:48,755 --> 00:15:52,426
♪ You're mommy's little boo. ♪

142
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:59,056
♪ Daddy will keep you
safe from harm. ♪

143
00:16:01,974 --> 00:16:05,271
♪ Our love will
save the world. ♪

144
00:16:08,841 --> 00:16:13,088
♪ Sleep, baby,
sleep in my arms. ♪

145
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,010
Mommy's singing.

146
00:16:19,575 --> 00:16:21,249
Mommy's singing.

147
00:16:22,472 --> 00:16:24,848
Oh, you are
still a little warm.

148
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,285
I think we'd best take
her temperature again.

149
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,629
- Mm! Uhm!
- Oh, Peggy!

150
00:16:46,369 --> 00:16:49,051
- Honey, did it break?
- Don't swallow, don't swallow any mercury.

151
00:16:49,117 --> 00:16:50,678
- Here.
- Wait, wait, wait.

152
00:16:50,751 --> 00:16:53,384
- Spit it out. There you go.
- Everything out. No glass.

153
00:16:53,456 --> 00:16:54,709
Wait a minute.
Wash your mouth.

154
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,261
Yeah, don't swallow
any mercury.

155
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,488
Wash it all out.

156
00:16:58,216 --> 00:17:00,691
- You okay? Rinse it out.
- Don't swallow.

157
00:17:01,031 --> 00:17:02,625
- Alright?
- Did you get it all?

158
00:17:02,712 --> 00:17:04,911
- Okay.
- I'm fine. Careful.

159
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,111
I got some on me.

160
00:17:12,557 --> 00:17:13,980
Baby.

161
00:17:16,775 --> 00:17:19,813
Bye, bye. Mommy
loves you so much.

162
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,506
Bye, bye.

163
00:17:26,634 --> 00:17:28,558
Bye, bye.

164
00:18:06,676 --> 00:18:10,463
I refuse to believe
someone did not realize

165
00:18:10,826 --> 00:18:13,308
that this potential existed!

166
00:18:13,729 --> 00:18:16,150
Well, you're welcome to believe
whatever you like, Dr. Mueller.

167
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:18,899
The fact of the matter is,
we did not.

168
00:18:19,004 --> 00:18:21,607
And you can kindly
spare us your indignation.

169
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,437
As I recall, you were
a member of this team.

170
00:18:23,554 --> 00:18:26,091
It's unbelievable. All the moisture
is gone, even the marrow.

171
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,944
It would take a temperature of 6000 degrees
centigrade to do something like this.

172
00:18:29,979 --> 00:18:31,775
It's the cleanest kill
I ever saw.

173
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,919
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
all that's very interesting,

174
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:36,099
but it's not what
I'm concerned with!

175
00:18:36,144 --> 00:18:40,887
What I care about is what caused this,
and can it be repeated?

176
00:18:41,826 --> 00:18:43,948
Now, let's get hot
and find some answers.

177
00:18:57,235 --> 00:18:59,600
Was there any plastic
in the area?

178
00:18:59,988 --> 00:19:03,241
- This could affect it.
- Yes. It all melted.

179
00:19:03,305 --> 00:19:05,576
- How did you know?
- This is Dr. Vandenmeer.

180
00:19:05,636 --> 00:19:07,313
I've asked him
to join us tonight.

181
00:19:07,445 --> 00:19:08,445
How do you do?

182
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,770
The body's burned
from the inside with fury.

183
00:19:16,699 --> 00:19:20,549
And the sound... the sound
like angel's scream.

184
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:22,893
The plastic melts.

185
00:19:23,118 --> 00:19:26,693
Everything else remains
with little or no damage.

186
00:19:26,983 --> 00:19:33,076
The covers, clothing, articles made
of cotton are particularly invulnerable.

187
00:19:33,516 --> 00:19:37,016
The human body, you see,
is the most complex

188
00:19:37,128 --> 00:19:41,128
electrically sparked combustion
engine we know of.

189
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:45,314
It is difficult for us to comprehend
spontaneous combustion.

190
00:19:45,581 --> 00:19:50,787
We would not have the same reaction
to a radio catching fire.

191
00:19:51,811 --> 00:19:56,474
SHC is a naturally occurring
phenomenon,

192
00:19:56,621 --> 00:20:01,640
but the odds of it striking any particular
individual are millions to one.

193
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,170
I believe the complexities of the
vaccines your subjects were given,

194
00:20:05,261 --> 00:20:07,712
combined with radiation
from the blast

195
00:20:07,822 --> 00:20:11,862
dramatically reduced those odds
to one to one.

196
00:20:12,365 --> 00:20:13,663
Yes.

197
00:20:14,498 --> 00:20:18,679
The fire from heaven
was certainly here today.

198
00:20:29,643 --> 00:20:33,124
S, H, C.

199
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,871
Spontaneous Human Combustion.

200
00:21:13,077 --> 00:21:16,912
"Why have my sisters husbands,
if they say they love you all?"

201
00:21:17,405 --> 00:21:21,738
" Haply, when I shall wed,
that lord whose hand must take my..."

202
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,914
"...plight shall carry.
Half my love with him,

203
00:21:25,177 --> 00:21:26,711
half my care and duty."

204
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:31,927
"Sure, I shall never marry
like my sisters. To love my father all."

205
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:35,660
- "But goes thy heart with this?"
- "Ay, my good lord."

206
00:21:37,165 --> 00:21:40,712
- <i>"So young..."</i>
- "So young and so untender?"

207
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,898
- "So young, my lord, and true."
- "Let it be so."

208
00:21:45,198 --> 00:21:48,365
- "Thy truth then be thy flower."
- Dower.

209
00:21:48,451 --> 00:21:51,704
"As by the sacred
radiance of the sun..."

210
00:21:52,659 --> 00:21:58,148
"By all the operation of the orbs
from whom we do exist and cease to be..."

211
00:21:59,047 --> 00:22:02,610
"I here disclaim
all paternal care,

212
00:22:02,677 --> 00:22:05,750
propinquity, and property
of blood,

213
00:22:06,181 --> 00:22:09,527
and as a stranger
to my heart and me,

214
00:22:09,656 --> 00:22:12,201
hold thee from this for ever."

215
00:22:12,922 --> 00:22:15,810
- That was awful!
- Give him the hook.

216
00:22:16,003 --> 00:22:19,184
What are you talking about?
That was great stuff.

217
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:22,811
In your dreams.
Really, Mr. Kramer, you stink.

218
00:22:22,889 --> 00:22:25,678
Gosh, I guess this means
I don't get the part.

219
00:22:28,554 --> 00:22:32,054
Wait a minute. Let's get
a second opinion on this.

220
00:22:32,214 --> 00:22:33,659
Well, what do you think?

221
00:22:35,542 --> 00:22:39,032
Uhh...
Don't give up your dayjob.

222
00:22:42,501 --> 00:22:45,033
So, can I take you out
to lunch for your birthday?

223
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:47,275
I'm dying to give you
your present.

224
00:22:47,329 --> 00:22:51,251
Can't. Gotta go do
battle with Mata Hari.

225
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:54,925
Just when we agree to sell
the house, she leases it out.

226
00:22:55,702 --> 00:22:57,702
- Bitch.
- Sam!

227
00:22:58,398 --> 00:23:02,292
Gee! You gonna talk that bad about me
after we're married and divorced

228
00:23:02,406 --> 00:23:04,813
and I take you
the cleaners, too?

229
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,781
No, you're worse.

230
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,475
- What'd you get me for my birthday?
- Uhmm...

231
00:23:11,626 --> 00:23:13,130
It's a surprise.

232
00:23:13,628 --> 00:23:16,113
- Tell me anyway!
- I don't know.

233
00:23:16,244 --> 00:23:17,703
Do you promise
you're gonna like it?

234
00:23:17,788 --> 00:23:20,034
I promise.
I promise.

235
00:23:21,351 --> 00:23:22,546
Well...

236
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:25,127
I had Dr. Persons
do your charts.

237
00:23:26,763 --> 00:23:29,082
Sam! Don't do that,
come on.

238
00:23:29,152 --> 00:23:32,150
You know, I respect your interests,
I don't see why you can't respect mine.

239
00:23:32,176 --> 00:23:34,143
I'm sorry. I woke up
feeling a little sick.

240
00:23:34,233 --> 00:23:37,013
I've had a headache all morning.
And I really am interested.

241
00:23:37,162 --> 00:23:38,711
What does it say,
is it a good one?

242
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:42,195
- Is what a good one?
- My chart.

243
00:23:43,116 --> 00:23:44,574
Yes, it is.

244
00:23:44,983 --> 00:23:49,797
It says that you're
a very lucky man with a purpose.

245
00:23:51,977 --> 00:23:53,141
Hm.

246
00:24:05,602 --> 00:24:07,476
You know, I think
you do have a fever.

247
00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:09,072
See?

248
00:24:09,802 --> 00:24:11,320
Listen...

249
00:24:13,017 --> 00:24:16,120
- Why don't you call me after school?
- Yes?

250
00:24:16,192 --> 00:24:19,925
And then you can take me out
to dinner for my birthday.

251
00:24:20,804 --> 00:24:23,924
<i>Students and faculty,
only ten minutes ago</i>

252
00:24:23,984 --> 00:24:27,330
<i>the Trinidad Beach Nuclear
Power Plant received it's core,</i>

253
00:24:27,495 --> 00:24:31,453
<i>making today its official birthday.
It goes online at midnight.</i>

254
00:24:31,649 --> 00:24:34,008
<i>Are you pro
or are you con?</i>

255
00:24:34,229 --> 00:24:36,832
<i>Students For Nuclear Logic

00:24:36,987 --> 00:24:38,767

264
00:24:58,689 --> 00:24:59,702
Boo!

265
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:03,608
Can I help you?
Do you go to school here?

266
00:25:04,266 --> 00:25:05,266
I was...

267
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,671
Thank you.

268
00:26:06,078 --> 00:26:08,008
Excuse me, do you
have a reservation?

269
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:09,532
Oh, no, no.

270
00:26:15,093 --> 00:26:17,719
- Hi.
- Hello, Sam.

271
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,133
Hello, John.

272
00:26:19,824 --> 00:26:21,690
How ya doin', fella?

273
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:24,942
How ya feelin'?
Migraine still bothering you?

274
00:26:25,075 --> 00:26:28,641
Why do you always do that?
You are not my doctor anymore.

275
00:26:30,309 --> 00:26:34,135
- Occupational habit.
- John and I just bumped into each other.

276
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:39,534
You used to "bump" into each other
a lot when we were married, too.

277
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:42,410
- Well, I've gotta be running along.
- Sit down, sit down.

278
00:26:42,499 --> 00:26:44,171
You guys can do whatever
the hell you want,

279
00:26:44,295 --> 00:26:46,018
we've been divorced
for two years.

280
00:26:46,157 --> 00:26:47,801
I really gotta go, Sam.

281
00:26:47,942 --> 00:26:49,942
I'll talk to you soon, Rachel.

282
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:52,989
It's good to
see you again, Sam.

283
00:26:57,317 --> 00:27:00,460
- You hate him, don't you?
- Quite the contrary.

284
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:02,274
I mean, he did me a favor.

285
00:27:03,054 --> 00:27:05,037
- Charming as ever.
- Look...

286
00:27:05,111 --> 00:27:07,511
I didn't invite him.
I mean, who...

287
00:27:08,197 --> 00:27:10,130
Don't know,
water under the bridge.

288
00:27:12,956 --> 00:27:15,287
You've already eaten.
I thought this was a lunch date.

289
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:17,577
I'm sorry, I couldn't
wait any longer.

290
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,537
And John was hungry,
so we went ahead.

291
00:27:19,632 --> 00:27:20,748
But I'm on time.

292
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:24,824
Besides, Grandfather's
picking me up any minute.

293
00:27:24,987 --> 00:27:28,527
How is the old geezer?
I miss him a lot.

294
00:27:28,618 --> 00:27:30,527
He asks about you
all the time.

295
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:32,515
Little orphan boy.

296
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,870
You know, if you had
taken about half as much

297
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:39,035
interest in me
as your grandfather, just...

298
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:40,201
Waiter!

299
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:43,126
Could we have
the check, please?

300
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:49,196
Why, dessert? No, I just could not
possibly squeeze another thing in.

301
00:27:50,467 --> 00:27:53,678
So, tell me...
How's your new girlfriend?

302
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:56,341
Been together
a while now.

303
00:27:57,204 --> 00:27:59,953
About three months.
We have a lot in common.

304
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:03,191
No surprises,
that's the best part.

305
00:28:05,822 --> 00:28:08,934
Oh, Sam... Did you
hear about Amy Whitaker?

306
00:28:09,285 --> 00:28:11,099
She died last night.

307
00:28:11,882 --> 00:28:14,224
What?
How is that possible?

308
00:28:14,298 --> 00:28:17,058
I mean, I was
only with her last night.

309
00:28:17,408 --> 00:28:21,394
God, I-I really feel guilty,
I mean, we had a terrible fight.

310
00:28:21,542 --> 00:28:25,303
She was gloating about Trinidad, and
I got so mad I could've killed her,

311
00:28:25,459 --> 00:28:26,653
and now she's dead.

312
00:28:26,765 --> 00:28:29,634
And I-I never had a chance
to make peace with her.

313
00:28:30,953 --> 00:28:33,518
Oh, the driver's here.
Waiter!

314
00:28:33,829 --> 00:28:36,112
- Can we have the check, please?
- Just one second, dear.

315
00:28:36,251 --> 00:28:38,713
Sam, be a dear and
take care of that, okay?

316
00:28:41,168 --> 00:28:42,909
Why don't you come out and
say hello to Grandfather?

317
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,791
It'd mean a lot to him.

318
00:29:04,103 --> 00:29:05,350
Hello, Lew.

319
00:29:06,807 --> 00:29:08,118
Sam!

320
00:29:08,585 --> 00:29:12,139
Oh, so nice to see you!

321
00:29:13,158 --> 00:29:15,086
- How are you?
- Fine.

322
00:29:15,769 --> 00:29:16,998
Headaches?

323
00:29:17,873 --> 00:29:19,658
Hey, you look great.

324
00:29:19,984 --> 00:29:21,528
That's a lie.

325
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:24,313
But I look awful.
Thanks anyway.

326
00:29:25,188 --> 00:29:27,798
Happy birthday, Sam!

327
00:29:28,775 --> 00:29:31,884
- Thank you.
- Oh yes, happy birthday.

328
00:29:32,193 --> 00:29:34,282
Uh, Grandfather, we really
have to go, I'm already late.

329
00:29:34,343 --> 00:29:36,264
- <i>Amy Whitaker...</i>
- Hold on, wait a minute.

330
00:29:36,393 --> 00:29:38,697
Just one second.
Tha-that's Amy.

331
00:29:38,829 --> 00:29:43,268
<i>...was found dead last night,
an apparent victim of smoking in bed.</i>

332
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,850
<i>The body was burned
beyond recognition,</i>

333
00:29:45,997 --> 00:29:48,433
<i>and had to be identified
by dental records.</i>

334
00:29:48,581 --> 00:29:52,890
<i>Ms. Whitaker was found by close friend
and associate, Rachel Orlander,</i>

335
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:55,894
<i>daughter of billionaire industrialist,
Lewis Orlander,</i>

336
00:29:56,017 --> 00:29:58,654
<i>who serves as Chief Adviser
to the board of directors</i>

337
00:29:58,724 --> 00:30:00,399
<i>of the nuclear power plant.</i>

338
00:30:00,501 --> 00:30:03,966
<i>Ironically, Ms. Whitaker's death
comes on a day that should have been</i>

339
00:30:04,056 --> 00:30:07,106
<i>one of victory for her,
as the controversial power plant,</i>

340
00:30:07,254 --> 00:30:09,395
<i>after a ten year
battle in the courts,</i>

341
00:30:09,449 --> 00:30:11,850
<i>comes online
at midnight tonight.</i>

342
00:30:11,901 --> 00:30:14,701
- <i>The memorial...</i>
- We have to go. Simon?

343
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,715
Simon.

344
00:30:23,575 --> 00:30:25,876
I hope you haven't
forgotten your bill?

345
00:30:27,028 --> 00:30:29,158
My bill? Shit.

346
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,651
Could I have the check
and a glass of water, please?

347
00:30:34,371 --> 00:30:38,105
Walking the check is
a very serious offense, my friend.

348
00:30:44,022 --> 00:30:47,020
Your check is over $50,
and that's a felony, pal.

349
00:30:47,231 --> 00:30:49,685
You know what I mean?
Cops?

350
00:31:35,209 --> 00:31:38,513
Trinidad goes online at midnight.
Isn't that exciting, Sam?

351
00:31:38,641 --> 00:31:41,515
- Yeah, great.
- How'd you do this?

352
00:31:41,703 --> 00:31:45,027
I don't know, it just...
burned off.

353
00:31:45,888 --> 00:31:48,741
Today's Monday.
Dr. Simpson's here.

354
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:51,344
I want him
to take a look at this.

355
00:31:51,456 --> 00:31:54,973
- Not Dr. Simpson.
- And why not, may I ask?

356
00:31:55,102 --> 00:31:58,075
Okay, two years ago,
I have a sore throat.

357
00:31:58,129 --> 00:32:01,067
He tells me, that I have
to have my tonsils out.

358
00:32:01,448 --> 00:32:04,848
- So?
- So, I had them out when I was seven.

359
00:32:06,234 --> 00:32:08,019
Maybe they grew back.

360
00:32:10,172 --> 00:32:13,213
Well...
Looks like you'll live.

361
00:32:14,602 --> 00:32:17,346
You have a slight fever,
but that should pass.

362
00:32:17,421 --> 00:32:19,414
Yeah, when I'm dead.

363
00:32:19,796 --> 00:32:21,177
I beg your pardon?

364
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:24,814
I've always had a fever
of about 100.

365
00:32:25,353 --> 00:32:29,367
It used to get me out of a lot
of classes when I was a kid.

366
00:32:30,639 --> 00:32:32,479
You teachers are
as bad as the students.

367
00:32:32,552 --> 00:32:34,590
Everybody wants
a note from the doctor.

368
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,080
Except, you get paid
when you're off.

369
00:32:37,116 --> 00:32:40,352
Dr. Simpson, 
I don't want to go home.

370
00:32:40,468 --> 00:32:42,350
- I didn't even--
- Do you smoke?

371
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:48,166
You already asked me that,
and I told you no.

372
00:32:48,293 --> 00:32:52,718
See, that finger looks like
you burned it lighting a cigarette.

373
00:32:53,289 --> 00:32:55,205
That's it. That's it!
I'm outta here.

374
00:32:55,329 --> 00:32:57,307
I have a bad enough
migraine as it is.

375
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:00,638
In fact, good doctor,
I think I will go home.

376
00:33:00,769 --> 00:33:02,048
Thank you, Sarah.

377
00:33:02,386 --> 00:33:03,926
Thank you, Dr. Simpson.

378
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:06,911
As usual, your help
has been invaluable.

379
00:33:09,219 --> 00:33:10,385
What was that?

380
00:33:10,758 --> 00:33:13,369
A little... static electricity.

381
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,356
<i>Spontaneous combustion,
oh yes.</i>

382
00:33:29,495 --> 00:33:32,284
<i>In ancient times it was called
the fire from heaven,</i>

383
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:34,739
<i>until a priest died
in the 1800s.</i>

384
00:33:34,862 --> 00:33:36,472
<i>"How could it be from heaven,"
it was asked,</i>

385
00:33:36,503 --> 00:33:38,198
<i>"if it attacked the clergy?"</i>

386
00:33:38,313 --> 00:33:41,039
- <i>"Dr. Persons..."</i>
- Dr. Persons.

387
00:33:41,636 --> 00:33:43,729
- <i>Because my husband is a fireman.</i>
- Too perfect.

388
00:33:43,852 --> 00:33:47,307
<i>And he says that very often,
when a person was reported as... as...</i>

389
00:33:47,393 --> 00:33:50,399
<i>As having died because
they were smoking in bed,</i>

390
00:33:50,546 --> 00:33:53,072
<i>it was really
spontaneous combustion.</i>

391
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,973
<i>But they're, uh...
not supposed to talk about it.</i>

392
00:33:58,342 --> 00:34:02,023
<i>So, the firemen aren't
supposed to talk about this?</i>

393
00:34:02,389 --> 00:34:05,764
<i>He says you can always tell
when it wasn't a regular fire.</i>

394
00:34:05,967 --> 00:34:09,987
<i>See, the... the whole body burns,
except the feet,</i>

395
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:11,722
<i>and-and sometimes the head.</i>

396
00:34:11,846 --> 00:34:15,348
<i>And if there's any plastic
in the area, it melts.</i>

397
00:34:15,379 --> 00:34:18,250
<i>Nothing else,
just the plastic.</i>

398
00:34:18,401 --> 00:34:20,972
<i>Then...
what is your question?</i>

399
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,952
<i>How may I help you?</i>

400
00:34:23,505 --> 00:34:26,014
<i>Well... there was
another one last night.</i>

401
00:34:26,146 --> 00:34:28,559
<i>Now that's the third one
he's seen this year.</i>

402
00:34:28,723 --> 00:34:32,783
<i>And, uh... he says he's heard
it could be contagious,</i>

403
00:34:32,848 --> 00:34:34,995
<i>it's like a virus or something.</i>

404
00:34:35,111 --> 00:34:37,687
<i>Oh God, I'm so worried!</i>

405
00:34:38,689 --> 00:34:42,812
<i>What was this person's name?
The one who died last night.</i>

406
00:34:43,194 --> 00:34:45,843
<i>Well, it was Whitaker.
Amy... Amy Whitaker.</i>

407
00:34:45,928 --> 00:34:49,427
- <i>The woman from the power plant.</i>
- Amy? Spontaneous combustion?

408
00:34:50,134 --> 00:34:52,761
<i>We will be back
in just a few moments,</i>

409
00:34:52,901 --> 00:34:55,601
<i>and I will
attempt to communicate--</i>

410
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:24,360
<i>Do you hold the key?</i>

411
00:35:24,477 --> 00:35:26,454
<i>Just the other side
of that mystical door,</i>

412
00:35:26,578 --> 00:35:28,280
<i>of the chamber
at the top of your mind...</i>

413
00:35:30,669 --> 00:35:33,736
<i>...worth far more than gold
or fame or power.</i>

414
00:35:35,329 --> 00:35:37,928
- Hi.
- <i>Hello, Sam?</i>

415
00:35:38,782 --> 00:35:40,961
- Lew!
- <i>Are you all right?</i>

416
00:35:41,682 --> 00:35:46,165
- Yes, of course I am.
- <i>Rachel told me you burned your finger.</i>

417
00:35:46,217 --> 00:35:49,246
- <i>Is it serious?</i>
- How could Rac...?

418
00:35:49,826 --> 00:35:52,493
No, Lew, it's...
It's nothin', it's fine.

419
00:35:52,987 --> 00:35:56,155
- <i>You sure?</i>
- I'm positive.

420
00:35:56,914 --> 00:36:00,648
<i>All the same, I'd like John Marsh
to take a look at it.</i>

421
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:04,624
Lew, I saw him once today,
that's enough.

422
00:36:04,985 --> 00:36:07,285
Okay? Don't worry,
I'm fine.

423
00:36:07,475 --> 00:36:09,122
<i>Don't be upset.</i>

424
00:36:09,279 --> 00:36:14,200
<i>I will now attempt to communicate
with the recently departed spirit</i>

425
00:36:14,407 --> 00:36:17,122
- <i>of Amy Whitaker.</i>
- <i>Hey, when am I gonna see you?</i>

426
00:36:18,171 --> 00:36:20,345
<i>If Muhammad won't come
to the mountain,</i>

427
00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:23,345
<i>then the mountain will
have to come to him.</i>

428
00:36:23,416 --> 00:36:26,077
<i>Will you have lunch
with me on Thursday?</i>

429
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:28,096
Of course I will,
I'd love to.

430
00:36:28,234 --> 00:36:31,180
<i>All right, son,
then I'll see you.</i>

431
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,577
Okay, bye, Lew.

432
00:36:34,259 --> 00:36:35,283
<i>Danger.</i>

433
00:36:35,804 --> 00:36:40,007
<i>It's... very dangerous.
They...</i>

434
00:36:41,046 --> 00:36:42,160
<i>I can't...</i>

435
00:36:43,749 --> 00:36:46,849
<i>Oh, I can't seem
to reach the spirit at this time.</i>

436
00:36:47,563 --> 00:36:51,329
<i>Perhaps she has already
been reincarnated, or...</i>

437
00:36:52,226 --> 00:36:55,425
<i>Or perhaps she is in
another galaxy or dimension.</i>

438
00:36:57,008 --> 00:36:59,635
<i>Very difficult.
Very.</i>

439
00:37:00,435 --> 00:37:02,539
<i>I think she must be hiding.</i>

440
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,969
<i>A real trickster, this one.</i>

441
00:37:07,345 --> 00:37:08,648
<i>Well...</i>

442
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:10,786
<i>I can see
we're coming up on the hour,</i>

443
00:37:10,888 --> 00:37:14,349
<i>and it's time for the news.
I certainly hope that all my good listeners...</i>

444
00:37:14,495 --> 00:37:16,685
<i>Hi, this is Lisa.
I can't take your call right now,</i>

445
00:37:16,796 --> 00:37:19,048
<i>but please leave a message
after the beep.</i>

446
00:37:19,972 --> 00:37:22,643
Hi, sweetheart. It's me,
the world's greatest actor.

447
00:37:22,736 --> 00:37:25,394
Where are you? I thought
we were getting together.

448
00:37:25,781 --> 00:37:28,506
Please give me a call.
I have to talk to you.

449
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:36,934
<i>WKTO News Time,
6 o'clock.</i>

450
00:37:37,447 --> 00:37:40,588
<i>In local news, the Trinidad
Beach Nuclear Power Plant</i>

451
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:42,901
<i>finally comes online
tonight at midnight.</i>

452
00:37:43,015 --> 00:37:44,957
<i>Only six hours from now.</i>

453
00:37:45,064 --> 00:37:48,238
<i>A small group of peaceful
but determined demonstrators</i>

454
00:37:48,292 --> 00:37:50,622
<i>have been keeping vigil
for more than five days</i>

455
00:37:50,691 --> 00:37:53,565
<i>in front of the main gates
of the super power facility,</i>

456
00:37:53,632 --> 00:37:56,232
<i>but so far there have
been no arrests.</i>

457
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:48,615
Sam!

458
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,013
What's the matter?

459
00:40:50,086 --> 00:40:53,105
Oh, Lisa, thank God.
I left the keys to the apartment.

460
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:56,651
Where were you?
I called and I called.

461
00:40:56,791 --> 00:40:59,597
I told you, I had
my self-hypnosis class.

462
00:41:00,349 --> 00:41:02,615
Then I stopped by
back at school.

463
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:05,117
You're not gonna believe
what is going on over there.

464
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:07,810
There's all this police
and reporters.

465
00:41:08,901 --> 00:41:12,095
- Dr. Simpson died.
- What?

466
00:41:13,035 --> 00:41:14,912
How?
What happened?

467
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:17,873
He burned to death.

468
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:20,448
And the weird thing is,
he was in the gym,

469
00:41:20,528 --> 00:41:23,780
in the shower,
with the water running.

470
00:41:35,823 --> 00:41:38,129
Spontaneous human combustion?

471
00:41:39,141 --> 00:41:41,339
That's what one
of the reporters called it.

472
00:41:41,783 --> 00:41:43,565
SHC.

473
00:41:44,428 --> 00:41:46,523
It happens all the time,
he said.

474
00:41:47,399 --> 00:41:49,260
Are you okay?

475
00:41:49,997 --> 00:41:51,996
So what happened
to your finger?

476
00:41:52,024 --> 00:41:53,551
It burned.

477
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:58,098
Two people died.

478
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:04,458
Two people I know
burned to death,

479
00:42:04,629 --> 00:42:08,496
and then--and then, dang,
my finger just spontaneously...

480
00:42:08,975 --> 00:42:11,853
I'm gonna call Dr. Persons.
He's on till 8:30.

481
00:42:18,708 --> 00:42:22,293
"Lisa... Thanks.
Love, Lew."

482
00:42:24,945 --> 00:42:26,135
What's this?

483
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:28,700
What?

484
00:42:28,851 --> 00:42:31,087
I didn't know
you knew Lew.

485
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:36,556
What gives?

486
00:42:37,499 --> 00:42:39,420
I'm into older men, okay?

487
00:42:39,953 --> 00:42:43,251
Uh, yes, let me speak to Dr. Persons,
please, it's an emergency.

488
00:42:44,004 --> 00:42:46,623
No, no, it can't wait. Listen,
I happen to be a supporter,

489
00:42:46,726 --> 00:42:50,460
I sent in $75, and I--and I'd
like to speak to him now.

490
00:42:52,253 --> 00:42:54,815
This is Dr. Persons,
how may I help you?

491
00:42:55,611 --> 00:42:58,028
- <i>Hello?</i>
- You talk to him.

492
00:42:58,184 --> 00:42:59,202
- Talk to him.
- <i>I'm going to have to go</i>

493
00:42:59,334 --> 00:43:01,928
- <i>to the next caller.</i>
- What am I supposed to say?

494
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:05,854
Uhm...

495
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:09,409
- Something's happening to me.
- <i>I sense danger.</i>

496
00:43:09,549 --> 00:43:10,757
Terrible danger.

497
00:43:10,874 --> 00:43:13,070
I never knew
my parents.

498
00:43:13,468 --> 00:43:16,080
But I saw them.
I mean, I left my body,

499
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:17,465
and I saw them.

500
00:43:17,724 --> 00:43:18,907
Just a moment.

501
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:22,953
Just a moment.
There is a woman.

502
00:43:23,093 --> 00:43:24,033
And...

503
00:43:24,203 --> 00:43:30,106
- <i>She is singing.</i>
- Oh God, I think my mother's name is Peggy.

504
00:43:30,347 --> 00:43:32,468
How the hell
do I know that?

505
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:36,630
She sang to you
when you were a little baby.

506
00:43:37,063 --> 00:43:38,836
Yes! I remember!

507
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,295
"Save the world."

508
00:43:43,024 --> 00:43:44,916
I'm to use my gift.

509
00:43:46,402 --> 00:43:48,723
Who--who are you, young man?
What is your name?

510
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:50,438
<i>David Bell.</i>

511
00:43:54,725 --> 00:43:57,154
Oh my God, I have
a birthmark on my hand;

512
00:43:57,209 --> 00:44:00,009
it's twice its normal size,
it's growing!

513
00:44:00,245 --> 00:44:02,974
- Oh God!
- <i>Hello?</i>

514
00:44:03,385 --> 00:44:05,592
<i>It appears that
we got disconnected.</i>

515
00:44:05,731 --> 00:44:06,976
- <i>I will now take...</i>
- <i>Hello?</i>

516
00:44:07,115 --> 00:44:10,060
- <i>Oh my God, is the young man...</i>
- I have to take you to a doctor!

517
00:44:10,191 --> 00:44:11,873
<i>...still listening?
With the birthmark?</i>

518
00:44:12,013 --> 00:44:15,420
<i>He must call the station immediately.
I knew his parents.</i>

519
00:44:15,543 --> 00:44:20,263
<i>Brian and Peggy Bell.
He may be experiencing some changes.</i>

520
00:44:20,346 --> 00:44:24,534
- <i>His life may be in danger.</i>
- <i>Oh, I... I can see now.</i>

521
00:44:24,897 --> 00:44:28,678
<i>This singing lady...
Yes, they knew you.</i>

522
00:44:29,739 --> 00:44:31,967
<i>Oh. She is crying now.</i>

523
00:44:33,627 --> 00:44:36,052
Uh, but I-I must go now.

524
00:44:36,344 --> 00:44:38,935
I-If the young man
is listening,

525
00:44:39,074 --> 00:44:42,210
we hope he will call back
next week betwen 5 and 8:30,

526
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:44,560
and we hope that
all you good listeners

527
00:44:44,708 --> 00:44:47,055
will be back
at that time too.

528
00:44:47,708 --> 00:44:50,398
Until then,
I bid you good evening.

529
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:54,246
No! Pick up, you
mind-reading son of a bitch!

530
00:44:54,409 --> 00:44:56,355
- KTOB.
- Dr. Persons!

531
00:44:56,453 --> 00:44:59,398
It's me, the one
the woman was talking about.

532
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,865
The program's off the air now,
you'll have to call back next week.

533
00:45:01,884 --> 00:45:03,525
<i>Is he there?</i>

534
00:45:03,884 --> 00:45:05,756
I have to get to him.

535
00:45:05,888 --> 00:45:09,205
- <i>It's an emergency.</i>
- Listen, the phone is still busy, okay?

536
00:45:09,344 --> 00:45:11,194
- I will hold.
- No, madam.

537
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:14,133
<i>Do you have any idea
where he was calling from?</i>

538
00:45:15,324 --> 00:45:17,580
You understand, I couldn't
give out that information

539
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:18,797
even if I had it.

540
00:45:19,788 --> 00:45:24,278
Could you take down a message
and give it to him before he leaves?

541
00:45:24,418 --> 00:45:27,524
Shit! Look, I'm not responsible
for chasing down people

542
00:45:27,664 --> 00:45:28,697
<i>for personal calls.</i>

543
00:45:28,829 --> 00:45:30,930
Listen, you idiot!

544
00:45:31,902 --> 00:45:35,919
I don't think this is as important
as your lousy snot!

545
00:45:48,281 --> 00:45:51,224
<i>It's most important
that I reach him.</i>

546
00:45:51,339 --> 00:45:53,651
- Good evening.
- <i>This is not an ordinary situation--</i>

547
00:46:28,698 --> 00:46:30,525
Oh God!
No!

548
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:51,143
It's making it worse!

549
00:46:51,348 --> 00:46:54,435
It's making it worse, Sam!
The water is like fuel!

550
00:46:54,567 --> 00:46:56,048
I don't know
what to do!

551
00:47:01,662 --> 00:47:02,800
Sam!

552
00:47:05,235 --> 00:47:06,747
Sam!

553
00:47:13,175 --> 00:47:15,452
Oh, Sam!
Stop!

554
00:47:40,627 --> 00:47:42,125
God, I'm alive.

555
00:47:46,659 --> 00:47:51,060
I saw my mother and father.
They were trying to tell me something.

556
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,612
Okay, we're almost there,
how are you doing?

557
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,194
I'm not gonna
say this right,

558
00:48:06,228 --> 00:48:09,739
but I never realized it until today,
but my whole life I've been alone.

559
00:48:09,752 --> 00:48:13,261
I mean, I've always had people around,
I've been lucky in that way, but...

560
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:16,418
Really, I'm alone.

561
00:48:17,367 --> 00:48:19,490
Except today,

562
00:48:20,229 --> 00:48:22,427
when all this stuff
started happening,

563
00:48:22,568 --> 00:48:26,302
there was only one person that
I really wanted to be close to.

564
00:48:26,534 --> 00:48:31,317
Somebody I knew
that would help me with anything.

565
00:48:32,257 --> 00:48:33,488
I love you.

566
00:48:35,468 --> 00:48:39,961
- I'm so scared!
- Oh my God!

567
00:48:40,914 --> 00:48:43,714
Oh God, Sam,
it's just like your parents.

568
00:48:44,985 --> 00:48:48,622
- What are you talking about?
- It's okay, I know how you feel.

569
00:48:48,746 --> 00:48:50,890
My parents
burned to death, too.

570
00:48:53,028 --> 00:48:56,588
My parents didn't burn to death,
they drowned!

571
00:48:56,862 --> 00:48:59,481
Where'd you get
an idea like that?

572
00:48:59,706 --> 00:49:02,415
I don't know, I thought
I heard it somewhere.

573
00:49:02,538 --> 00:49:05,922
From who? Who would
say something like that?

574
00:49:07,922 --> 00:49:09,040
Lew.

575
00:49:09,756 --> 00:49:13,054
What is this with Lew!
How do you know him?

576
00:49:14,248 --> 00:49:15,837
Sam...

577
00:49:15,961 --> 00:49:17,993
I've known him
all my life.

578
00:49:18,363 --> 00:49:21,121
He's taking
care of me, since...

579
00:49:21,285 --> 00:49:25,041
Since my parents died, too.
That's how I know about yours.

580
00:49:25,499 --> 00:49:28,366
We owe him everything, Sam.
If it wasn't for him,

581
00:49:28,374 --> 00:49:30,209
we wouldn't even
know each other.

582
00:49:31,003 --> 00:49:35,046
- What?
- I wanted to tell you. I'm sorry.

583
00:49:35,608 --> 00:49:38,397
He set the whole thing up.
He...

584
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:42,957
He got me my job at school
just so that we would meet.

585
00:49:46,266 --> 00:49:47,839
Why didn't you tell me?

586
00:49:48,858 --> 00:49:51,134
I don't know.
I wanted to.

587
00:49:51,218 --> 00:49:54,681
But he told me that you
would be upset, and I just...

588
00:49:55,198 --> 00:49:57,965
I don't know, I just--
I went along with it.

589
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:02,172
I'm sorry if I did the wrong
thing, Sam, I love you.

590
00:50:49,392 --> 00:50:50,563
Help!

591
00:50:50,683 --> 00:50:52,455
Help!
Somebody help us!

592
00:50:52,536 --> 00:50:54,951
Help! Call the doctor!
Call the doctor right now!

593
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:57,401
Hurry!
Hurry!

594
00:51:00,313 --> 00:51:01,313
Here.

595
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:12,413
His arm is on fire!
In the car on the way here

596
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:14,034
it started to happen again!

597
00:51:14,121 --> 00:51:15,195
When did this happen?

598
00:51:15,253 --> 00:51:17,280
I don't know, there was fire
coming out of his arm!

599
00:51:17,589 --> 00:51:18,825
Sam?

600
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,444
Look at me.
Can you hear me?

601
00:51:21,724 --> 00:51:23,349
Help him, please!

602
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:26,912
Un... unwrap that for me,
would you, Sam?

603
00:51:28,749 --> 00:51:30,001
Just slip it off.

604
00:51:35,828 --> 00:51:37,570
Page Dr. Cagney, please.

605
00:51:37,688 --> 00:51:39,971
Tell him to get down
to my office immediately.

606
00:51:40,868 --> 00:51:42,043
Take him to my office.

607
00:51:44,886 --> 00:51:45,896
Lisa!

608
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,604
- It would be better if you wait here.
- No, I'm coming.

609
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:50,703
I would think that you
of all people would know that.

610
00:51:51,002 --> 00:51:52,207
I'm coming!

611
00:51:54,917 --> 00:51:56,924
Relax, Sam.
You will be fine.

612
00:51:57,507 --> 00:51:59,240
Put him against that wall.

613
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,234
All right, Sam.

614
00:52:29,098 --> 00:52:31,131
Just give me your hand.

615
00:52:31,861 --> 00:52:34,259
That a boy.
Just relax.

616
00:52:36,346 --> 00:52:38,512
You'll be feeling
much better.

617
00:52:54,182 --> 00:52:55,453
What's that?

618
00:52:57,164 --> 00:52:59,945
It's nothing, Sam.
Just hold still.

619
00:53:02,541 --> 00:53:03,741
That's it.

620
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:13,235
Tell me, Sam...
You taking medication?

621
00:53:13,755 --> 00:53:16,971
- No.
- Uhm, yes, actually.

622
00:53:17,095 --> 00:53:20,125
He's taking some pills
I gave him for his headaches.

623
00:53:20,156 --> 00:53:23,154
But they're not--they're not
really medicine, they're homeopathic.

624
00:53:23,286 --> 00:53:26,353
- For migraines.
- Do you have them with you?

625
00:53:26,528 --> 00:53:27,828
Yeah.

626
00:53:29,216 --> 00:53:30,706
Oh, yeah.

627
00:53:35,135 --> 00:53:36,435
Thank you.

628
00:53:38,429 --> 00:53:40,286
Would you excuse me,
one second?

629
00:54:07,925 --> 00:54:09,175
<i>He's here.</i>

630
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:11,290
<i>It's happening.</i>

631
00:54:12,127 --> 00:54:16,108
<i>No, sir, I disagree.
It is SHC.</i>

632
00:54:17,985 --> 00:54:21,763
<i>24 seconds or 24 hours,
the result is still the same.</i>

633
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:25,040
<i>Well, I'll handle this my way.</i>

634
00:54:25,634 --> 00:54:27,662
<i>It's time this project
is ended.</i>

635
00:54:48,753 --> 00:54:51,418
What the hell's going on?
Who were you talking to?

636
00:54:51,487 --> 00:54:53,307
Sam, you know
Dr. Cagney, don't you?

637
00:54:53,355 --> 00:54:55,070
- Yeah, but--
- Of course he does.

638
00:54:55,517 --> 00:54:58,328
I believe we've even 18-hole'd it
together a few times.

639
00:54:58,907 --> 00:55:00,615
We're old friends,
aren't we, Sam?

640
00:55:00,747 --> 00:55:03,329
Sam, I've asked Dr. Cagney
to look after you.

641
00:55:03,454 --> 00:55:05,659
I have an important
appointment I'm late for.

642
00:55:06,327 --> 00:55:08,054
But Marsh,
I want you to be...

643
00:55:08,202 --> 00:55:10,664
Don't worry, Sam.
You're in good hands.

644
00:55:11,021 --> 00:55:13,034
Lisa, you'll have to
come with me.

645
00:55:13,754 --> 00:55:16,608
- No, no, I wanna stay here.
- Please, don't worry.

646
00:55:17,162 --> 00:55:19,502
Dr. Cagney is
an excellent physician.

647
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,081
- Come on.
- Sam, I'll be right outside.

648
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:31,776
Make yourself comfortable.
Why don't you watch TV?

649
00:55:31,899 --> 00:55:33,309
I won't be a minute.

650
00:55:55,409 --> 00:55:57,540
Come.
We'll wait in here.

651
00:56:02,482 --> 00:56:03,574
- Sit.
- Why can't I...?

652
00:56:03,639 --> 00:56:06,404
Sit. Make yourselves comfortable.
I'd like to talk to you.

653
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:09,675
Sir? Excuse me.

654
00:56:10,462 --> 00:56:11,983
Would you mind?

655
00:56:13,913 --> 00:56:15,311
Thank you.

656
00:56:19,343 --> 00:56:21,590
Do you mind if I
ask you a few questions?

657
00:56:22,458 --> 00:56:24,561
Just how well
do you know Samson?

658
00:56:25,699 --> 00:56:28,294
- Do you mean Sam?
- What else could I mean?

659
00:56:30,958 --> 00:56:32,691
Just what is he to you?

660
00:56:34,068 --> 00:56:35,368
He's a friend.

661
00:56:38,926 --> 00:56:42,382
I'm curious, Lisa...
Are your migraines getting worse?

662
00:56:42,946 --> 00:56:46,418
- What?
- The pills you have to Sam...

663
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:49,640
- Do you take them as well?
- What are you talking about?

664
00:56:49,724 --> 00:56:51,318
How do you
know about all this?

665
00:56:51,429 --> 00:56:55,736
I work with Mr. Orlander. I took over
my father's research project,

666
00:56:55,876 --> 00:56:58,607
Samson, so there's absolutely
no reason whatsoever

667
00:56:58,658 --> 00:57:01,025
for any kind of
emotional crescendo.

668
00:57:01,409 --> 00:57:03,830
I mean, you are just
a little bit hysterical, aren't you?

669
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:07,722
What are you talking about?
What Project Samson?

670
00:57:08,398 --> 00:57:13,317
Orlander led me to believe
that you had... a special understanding.

671
00:57:13,863 --> 00:57:16,063
I know that Lew brought you
here from the East Coast

672
00:57:16,186 --> 00:57:19,131
to look after Sam.
So naturally, I assumed...

673
00:57:19,247 --> 00:57:22,274
Look. Lew has never
mentioned you to me.

674
00:57:22,398 --> 00:57:26,398
<i>...of unexplained and unrelated
deaths by fire this decade.</i>

675
00:57:26,546 --> 00:57:30,331
<i>Only two hours ago, noted radio
parapsychologist Myron Gold</i>

<i>Information.
What city, please?</i>

683
00:57:53,581 --> 00:57:56,087
Yeah, I'd like to speak
to Dr. Person--

684
00:57:57,095 --> 00:58:00,479
I'm sorry, I would like
to speak to Myron Gold,

685
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,355
in Laguna Beach, please.

686
00:58:02,588 --> 00:58:06,732
<i>The number is
341-3511.</i>

687
00:58:19,136 --> 00:58:24,000
Yes, I'd like to speak
to the woman that called.

688
00:58:32,468 --> 00:58:34,174
- Yeah.
- <i>Are you sure you got it?</i>

689
00:58:34,290 --> 00:58:36,499
- <i>It's most urgent that you call her.</i>
- Okay.

690
00:58:36,631 --> 00:58:38,983
- <i>You... please.</i>
- Allright.

691
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:42,109
- <i>Call her right away. I sense danger.</i>
- Yeah.

692
00:58:42,233 --> 00:58:43,602
Thank you.

693
00:59:49,078 --> 00:59:51,712
I have to give you
an injection, my friend.

694
00:59:55,682 --> 00:59:58,665
Don't play doctor with me, Cagney.
What's in these files?

695
00:59:59,332 --> 01:00:02,662
This is very important.
It will help lower your fever.

696
01:00:02,786 --> 01:00:05,677
Are you crazy? I wanna know
what's in these files.

697
01:00:05,801 --> 01:00:07,602
That's none of your business.

698
01:00:07,726 --> 01:00:10,404
Please don't make this any more
difficult than it is.

699
01:00:11,081 --> 01:00:13,189
I have to give you
this injection.

700
01:00:13,298 --> 01:00:14,975
You're fucking
trying to kill me!

701
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:26,582
These charts go back
to when I was a kid;

702
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:29,207
I did not know Marsh
until I was in college!

703
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,517
- How'd he get them?
- I don't know!

704
01:00:31,631 --> 01:00:33,139
You're lying!

705
01:00:33,261 --> 01:00:38,418
There's a chart on Lisa. Why?
Tell me, Cagney, I have to know!

706
01:00:38,542 --> 01:00:40,625
We should have flushed you
when we had a chance!

707
01:00:40,684 --> 01:00:41,984
You're a freak!

708
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,253
What is taking so long?

709
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:57,476
Don't worry.
It'll all be over shortly.

710
01:01:04,255 --> 01:01:05,455
Lisa!

711
01:01:13,105 --> 01:01:14,571
You're coming with me.

712
01:02:16,615 --> 01:02:18,015
David?

713
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:25,651
I'm Christina.

714
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,104
Nina.
Come in.

715
01:02:43,112 --> 01:02:46,766
They told me you died
when you were three.

716
01:02:52,297 --> 01:02:55,657
Sam's not your real name,
did you know that?

717
01:02:56,329 --> 01:03:01,414
They change your name
from David to Sam

718
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:03,495
after your parents died.

719
01:03:03,574 --> 01:03:04,980
Oh!

720
01:03:07,384 --> 01:03:10,000
David, what have they
done to you?

721
01:03:14,063 --> 01:03:18,034
So, you're telling me,
that they knew all along

722
01:03:18,151 --> 01:03:21,965
that this bomb shelter wouldn't
protect them from the radiation?

723
01:03:22,097 --> 01:03:26,110
The shelter was simply to
protect them from the blast.

724
01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:30,558
This was the whole point,
to test the anti-radiation drug.

725
01:03:31,133 --> 01:03:36,161
Uhh... it was administered every day
for months before the blast,

726
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:41,096
to protect them
and to build up this tolerance

727
01:03:41,153 --> 01:03:44,891
to atom sized thermites
in the blood streams.

728
01:03:45,186 --> 01:03:47,489
Didn't they tell 'em
what was going on?

729
01:03:48,483 --> 01:03:50,750
Yeah, wel,
more or less, they did.

730
01:03:54,738 --> 01:03:57,137
I have something
I want to show you.

731
01:03:58,267 --> 01:03:59,501
You come with me.

732
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,567
I want to show you.

733
01:04:24,085 --> 01:04:26,976
This trunk belongs
to you, Sam.

734
01:04:57,516 --> 01:04:58,981
Oh, God.

735
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:22,867
Look!

736
01:05:34,938 --> 01:05:36,268
Come sit down.

737
01:05:40,558 --> 01:05:41,658
<i>Ja.</i>

738
01:05:44,626 --> 01:05:47,346
That's your mother.
Peggy.

739
01:05:52,707 --> 01:05:54,598
And your father, Brian.

740
01:05:56,196 --> 01:05:59,162
They're my best friends,
I love them so much.

741
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:22,125
This was your father's birthday.
His 24th.

742
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:25,376
We were very happy.

743
01:06:30,766 --> 01:06:35,409
Yes, and you were born
two weeks later.

744
01:06:36,986 --> 01:06:39,790
See! There were
presents for you too.

745
01:06:54,282 --> 01:06:55,582
My God, I...

746
01:06:57,041 --> 01:06:59,019
I have a card
just like that.

747
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:17,457
Nina?

748
01:07:19,388 --> 01:07:21,604
I don't think
the experiment's over.

749
01:07:21,744 --> 01:07:23,044
Oh, it's over.

750
01:07:25,339 --> 01:07:27,039
But they're watching me.

751
01:07:27,689 --> 01:07:29,489
And there's files.

752
01:07:30,041 --> 01:07:33,647
No.
Nobody's interested.

753
01:07:34,612 --> 01:07:36,560
Certainly not
the government.

754
01:07:37,366 --> 01:07:40,058
Not even
Modern Technologies.

755
01:07:40,458 --> 01:07:45,482
They've accepted the fact that
immunization to radiation

756
01:07:45,605 --> 01:07:47,405
is totally unreasonable.

757
01:07:47,837 --> 01:07:52,587
Do you mean
Modern Atomic Technologies?

758
01:07:52,863 --> 01:07:57,900
Yeah. Yeah, they had the contracts
for the shelter, and the radiation drug,

759
01:07:58,025 --> 01:08:02,000
and they produced
the firing mechanisms for the bomb.

760
01:08:02,131 --> 01:08:04,854
- But that was Lew's company!
- Lew?

761
01:08:05,128 --> 01:08:10,136
My ex-wife's grandfather, the man
who's raised me since I was 12 years old!

762
01:08:10,223 --> 01:08:12,793
- Lew Orlander?
- Yes!

763
01:08:19,144 --> 01:08:21,411
Whe-where did you
get that watch?

764
01:08:23,664 --> 01:08:26,741
It was your father's watch.
Look.

765
01:08:26,857 --> 01:08:29,991
Look at the engraving on the inside,
there's a liberty bell,

766
01:08:30,107 --> 01:08:35,681
and two... a B, a B.
Brian Bell. Your father.

767
01:08:37,548 --> 01:08:39,684
I gotta get--I gotta
get outta here.

768
01:08:39,820 --> 01:08:42,302
- No, we have to talk, Sam.
- No, I...

769
01:08:44,488 --> 01:08:46,800
- I have to go.
- Please don't leave now.

770
01:08:46,924 --> 01:08:48,691
- We have to work.
- No.

771
01:10:05,486 --> 01:10:07,142
Silly old bitch.

772
01:10:08,654 --> 01:10:10,921
You and little Sammy
have a nice visit?

773
01:10:14,189 --> 01:10:16,878
They put the death sanction
on you ten years ago.

774
01:10:17,875 --> 01:10:19,175
What happened?

775
01:10:21,956 --> 01:10:24,388
Did the Grim Reaper
visit the wrong old lady?

776
01:10:29,649 --> 01:10:31,249
Just close your eyes.

777
01:10:32,536 --> 01:10:35,170
A thousand years will
go by just like that.

778
01:10:50,271 --> 01:10:52,660
<i>Cheatin' words,
lies and deception,</i>

779
01:10:52,784 --> 01:10:55,784
<i>as they weave their
path work of destiny.</i>

780
01:10:55,895 --> 01:10:59,276
<i>Samson's destiny
was controlled by betrayal,</i>

781
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:01,098
<i>like a symptom
of the night. He...</i>

782
01:11:01,229 --> 01:11:03,786
My entire life, controlled!

783
01:11:03,810 --> 01:11:05,921
I can't even tell anyone!
No one would believe me.

784
01:11:06,038 --> 01:11:08,038
It's... It's too fantastic!

785
01:11:10,957 --> 01:11:12,842
But they think I don't know
I have a mission?

786
01:11:12,922 --> 01:11:17,006
Oh, yes I will!
I will use my gift.

787
01:11:57,835 --> 01:11:59,932
- Hello?
- <i>Lisa?</i>

788
01:11:59,990 --> 01:12:02,720
- Sam! Thank God.
- My name... Lisa...

789
01:12:02,842 --> 01:12:04,307
I talked to the doctor.

790
01:12:04,383 --> 01:12:07,083
He said he's dealt with
spontaneous human combustion,

791
01:12:07,105 --> 01:12:08,286
<i>you're not going to die.</i>

792
01:12:08,410 --> 01:12:11,476
- My name is not Sam, it's...
- <i>Listen to me,</i>

793
01:12:11,734 --> 01:12:16,261
because this is very important.
The doctor can save your life.

794
01:12:16,397 --> 01:12:19,326
There is a vaccine.
The fire won't start again!

795
01:12:19,409 --> 01:12:23,409
<i>Just stay away from live fire.
Don't start the car again.</i>

796
01:12:23,459 --> 01:12:26,923
- I may have to get some help.
- Okay, okay. Well, wait there.

797
01:12:26,987 --> 01:12:28,790
- I'll come get you.
- <i>Lisa, listen to me!</i>

798
01:12:28,906 --> 01:12:30,648
Dr. Marsh can help.

799
01:12:30,788 --> 01:12:35,266
John Mash, doctor?
He's a fucknig killer, Lisa!

800
01:12:35,365 --> 01:12:37,847
And he's after you!
Lisa, listen to me,

801
01:12:37,931 --> 01:12:41,042
<i>I have seen files.
Lots of files.</i>

802
01:12:41,149 --> 01:12:44,919
Lisa! He'll try to
give you an injection!

803
01:12:44,965 --> 01:12:46,165
An--

804
01:12:49,371 --> 01:12:51,926
<i>Oh, God.
God!</i>

805
01:12:55,265 --> 01:12:59,946
If you're in on my kill,
then fuck you!

806
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:03,358
If you are, then you'd
better run for your life!

807
01:13:03,506 --> 01:13:05,392
No, Sam,
I love you!

808
01:13:05,984 --> 01:13:08,615
Nuclear power's given,
<i>I'm proof of that.</i>

809
01:13:08,836 --> 01:13:11,011
<i>But the old man
set me up with Rachle,</i>

810
01:13:11,648 --> 01:13:13,216
<i>and then with you!</i>

811
01:13:14,593 --> 01:13:17,729
What part of Samson do you serve?
I mean, what did you do to me?

812
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:20,438
Did you do something to me
that started this fire?

813
01:13:21,213 --> 01:13:24,250
- No.
- What was in those pills you gave me?

814
01:13:24,374 --> 01:13:25,853
Nothing.

815
01:13:26,936 --> 01:13:28,276
I don't know.

816
01:13:29,654 --> 01:13:33,165
- Where did you get them?
- <i>He said he wanted...</i>

817
01:13:33,342 --> 01:13:35,277
He said you
wouldn't take them for him.

818
01:13:35,399 --> 01:13:37,537
<i>He said that
I would have to make you!</i>

819
01:13:37,601 --> 01:13:39,608
- <i>He was worried about you!</i>
- Who?

820
01:13:39,637 --> 01:13:40,667
<i>Who!</i>

821
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:45,967
- Lew.
- No, no! God, Lisa!

822
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:47,630
<i>No, Lisa!</i>

823
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:57,924
Oh God, pain. Go away,
come again some other day.

824
01:15:18,903 --> 01:15:23,377
Driver's license...
and registration, please.

825
01:15:24,819 --> 01:15:26,019
Slowly.

826
01:15:27,914 --> 01:15:30,326
- You sure you want it?
- Yes.

827
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,100
Halt!

828
01:15:55,898 --> 01:15:58,189
Burn, goddamn you!

829
01:17:03,803 --> 01:17:06,741
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Lew! Lew, it's Sam!

830
01:17:07,017 --> 01:17:09,169
It's happened!
His arm is on fire!

831
01:17:09,211 --> 01:17:11,188
It's SHC,
and it's spreading!

832
01:17:11,224 --> 01:17:13,972
<i>Lisa, relax. Everything's
going to be all right.</i>

833
01:17:14,010 --> 01:17:17,648
He just called me, Lew,
and fire came out of the phone!

834
01:17:17,763 --> 01:17:20,793
H-he did it! He made it happen!
I'm afraid!

835
01:17:20,906 --> 01:17:24,887
- <i>Is he taking his pills?</i>
- Yes, yes, I've been giving them to him.

836
01:17:24,934 --> 01:17:27,724
<i>Have a hold on you, Lisa.
have you been taking your pills, too?</i>

837
01:17:28,068 --> 01:17:32,340
No, I... I've been fine.
I haven't had any migraines.

838
01:17:32,472 --> 01:17:35,474
<i>Lisa, you have to take them
at regular intervals, too!</i>

839
01:17:35,693 --> 01:17:39,147
<i>Then I want you to calm down
and go see Dr. Marsh.</i>

840
01:17:39,279 --> 01:17:44,379
Lew, is Dr. Marsh? John Marsh, what
does he have to do with same and me?

841
01:17:44,489 --> 01:17:47,738
- I don't trust him!
- <i>Lisa, Dr. Marsh is a friend.</i>

842
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:50,503
<i>He's trying to help you.
Now take the pills.</i>

843
01:17:50,642 --> 01:17:52,784
<i>Everything will be fine.
I'll get back to you.</i>

844
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:55,902
What is going on?
What is happening to me?

845
01:17:57,824 --> 01:17:59,024
Lew?

846
01:18:19,167 --> 01:18:20,467
Come on in!

847
01:18:40,745 --> 01:18:42,145
Good evening, Sam.

848
01:18:42,521 --> 01:18:45,108
Boss said I should be
expecting a visit from ya.

849
01:18:45,166 --> 01:18:46,959
He's waitin'
up there for ya.

850
01:18:47,673 --> 01:18:51,069
- Waiting so late?
- Oh, by the way, happy birthday!

851
01:18:51,231 --> 01:18:52,989
Hold on,
I got something for ya.

852
01:18:53,435 --> 01:18:56,737
Nice old Mr. Fitzpatrick.
Isn't it time you retired?

853
01:18:56,852 --> 01:18:58,152
Just hold on.

854
01:19:02,886 --> 01:19:06,181
Sam... Get out
with your hands on your head.

855
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,380
Come on, now.

856
01:19:18,758 --> 01:19:23,701
Only my right arm works, so I don't know
how I'll handle your request, officer.

857
01:19:24,118 --> 01:19:27,157
Y-you put your arm up there!
I mean it!

858
01:19:27,448 --> 01:19:30,000
Why don't you come over here
and put it there yourself?

859
01:19:33,398 --> 01:19:34,664
Don't fuck up, now.

860
01:19:43,808 --> 01:19:45,408
Fitzpatrick...

861
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:48,323
I thought you
were my friend.

862
01:19:50,402 --> 01:19:52,798
As you can see,
I'm not all here.

863
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:56,866
- I'm so sorry, Sam.
- Stay back!

864
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:33,947
Lew!
Uncle Samson's here!

865
01:21:46,454 --> 01:21:50,043
Hello, my boy!
Come in, come in.

866
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:55,566
Always glad to see you.
I... I  kinda hoped you got by.

867
01:21:56,182 --> 01:21:58,178
- Where's Rachel?
 - Oh...

868
01:21:58,727 --> 01:22:01,932
Sorry, she's...
She's out for the evening.

869
01:22:02,047 --> 01:22:04,070
You know, son,
you don't look so well.

870
01:22:04,193 --> 01:22:06,659
Hasn't Lisa been
taking care of you?

871
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:12,411
- How do you know her?
- Well, she's a friend of the family.

872
01:22:12,951 --> 01:22:17,742
- S-she called here looking for you.
- You mean to warn you.

873
01:22:20,097 --> 01:22:24,421
God! Lew, you killed
my parents!

874
01:22:25,522 --> 01:22:27,900
I did not
kill your parents.

875
01:22:27,911 --> 01:22:30,183
They knew exactly
what they were doing.

876
01:22:30,849 --> 01:22:33,527
The vaccine they were given
was designed to create a shield

877
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:36,293
around their cells to make them
impervious to radiation!

878
01:22:36,425 --> 01:22:39,262
- And it worked!
- For nine months!

879
01:22:39,394 --> 01:22:41,327
Yes, nine months!

880
01:22:41,773 --> 01:22:45,187
How long do you think the first
heart transplant patients lived?

881
01:22:45,303 --> 01:22:48,498
- Days! That's all.
- But they were sick!

882
01:22:50,212 --> 01:22:52,687
My parents were
young and healthy!

883
01:22:52,832 --> 01:22:54,132
And look at me!

884
01:22:54,629 --> 01:22:57,284
Look what you've
done to me, you...!

885
01:22:58,292 --> 01:23:01,040
You are awfully ungrateful.

886
01:23:02,698 --> 01:23:04,360
You're a lucky man.

887
01:23:04,612 --> 01:23:08,150
I have watched over you
as if you were mine.

888
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:11,113
I've given you everything.

889
01:23:11,445 --> 01:23:13,828
Y-you should thank me!

890
01:23:14,709 --> 01:23:16,009
Thank you?

891
01:23:18,887 --> 01:23:22,759
By all rights, you should
never have been born.

892
01:23:22,891 --> 01:23:25,757
And if it wasn't for me,
you never would have been.

893
01:23:26,597 --> 01:23:32,605
When your mother got pregnant, those
idiots thought the project were ruined.

894
01:23:32,728 --> 01:23:34,965
They dropped the whole thing.

895
01:23:35,321 --> 01:23:40,422
But it wasn't a mistake.
I gave Brian Bell $25,000

896
01:23:40,546 --> 01:23:42,841
to make that "mistake".

897
01:23:42,957 --> 01:23:46,178
I've had high hopes
for what would happen,

898
01:23:46,221 --> 01:23:51,460
and you didn't let me down.
I am so proud of you.

899
01:23:52,094 --> 01:23:53,878
Don't you see, Sam?

900
01:23:54,572 --> 01:23:59,069
I'm your father.
Brian Bell was just the mistake part.

901
01:23:59,153 --> 01:24:05,058
I made the sun rise twice
that morning in 1955.

902
01:24:05,448 --> 01:24:08,997
What did Brain Bell
do to compare with that?

903
01:24:11,397 --> 01:24:13,985
Now this is all Marsh's fault.

904
01:24:14,677 --> 01:24:19,366
He always wanted to...
put down the project.

905
01:24:19,751 --> 01:24:21,586
That's a lie!

906
01:24:22,337 --> 01:24:26,542
It was in the pills that you
and that... bitch Lisa gave me!

907
01:24:26,677 --> 01:24:30,396
She's like you, Sam.
A product of the project.

908
01:24:30,807 --> 01:24:35,953
She was conceived during
the last above ground test in '65.

909
01:24:36,449 --> 01:24:40,949
The vaccine worked.
But SHC always followed.

910
01:24:41,286 --> 01:24:45,388
Lisa and you, I thought
you might honestly like her.

911
01:24:46,252 --> 01:24:49,260
I hoped you two
would produce a child,

912
01:24:49,345 --> 01:24:52,742
learn to control this thing
and use it. It...

913
01:24:54,216 --> 01:24:56,658
...would have
been a thing of beauty.

914
01:24:57,522 --> 01:24:59,350
I'm sorry, Sam.

915
01:24:59,482 --> 01:25:02,277
I got tired of waiting
for something to happen.

916
01:25:02,756 --> 01:25:04,985
34 years was
long enough.

917
01:25:05,379 --> 01:25:08,894
I had no idea it would
be this extraordinary.

918
01:25:10,995 --> 01:25:15,877
The cleanest killing system
on earth.

919
01:25:16,955 --> 01:25:20,195
Clean killing system?
I like that.

920
01:25:20,579 --> 01:25:23,854
You're America's
atomic man.

921
01:25:25,168 --> 01:25:28,883
The world's most sophisticated
nuclear weapon.

922
01:25:29,306 --> 01:25:31,869
Can't you see
how big this is?

923
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:36,380
Let's see...

924
01:25:39,893 --> 01:25:41,777
Time to go online.

925
01:25:42,148 --> 01:25:44,222
Just Trinidad and me.

926
01:25:47,516 --> 01:25:51,244
Nuclear meltdown!
I can almost see the core.

927
01:26:11,771 --> 01:26:16,234
<i>The Trinidad Beach Nuclear Power Plant
finally came online tonight at midnight,</i>

928
01:26:16,350 --> 01:26:17,927
<i>but not without problems.</i>

929
01:26:18,051 --> 01:26:22,031
<i>15 seconds into the switchover
to nuclear generated electricity,</i>

930
01:26:22,114 --> 01:26:26,055
<i>a 5-mile strip along the exclusive
cliff community of Trinidad Bluffs,</i>

931
01:26:26,186 --> 01:26:30,026
<i>suffered a tremendous surge
of electricity that resulted in a back surge,</i>

932
01:26:30,156 --> 01:26:33,485
<i>damaging some very valuable equipment
in the nuclear facility.</i>

933
01:26:33,681 --> 01:26:35,793
<i>The damanged equipment,
a regulator,</i>

934
01:26:35,916 --> 01:26:38,781
<i>affects the amount of power
sent to Southland suburbs,</i>

935
01:26:38,846 --> 01:26:41,966
<i>and potential power surges
may continue for some time.</i>

936
01:26:42,082 --> 01:26:45,302
<i>So unplug your computer and anything
else whose program can be scrambled</i>

937
01:26:45,441 --> 01:26:47,115
<i>until this warning
is lifted.</i>

938
01:26:47,371 --> 01:26:49,563
<i>Hi, this is Lisa, I can't
take your call right now,</i>

939
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:51,629
<i>but please leave
a message after the beep.</i>

940
01:26:51,753 --> 01:26:53,540
<i>No meltdowns
tonight, Bob.</i>

941
01:26:53,641 --> 01:26:55,939
<i>Now, back to
a more innocent time,</i>

942
01:26:56,062 --> 01:26:57,729
<i>with this golden oldie...</i>

943
01:26:57,885 --> 01:26:59,627
<i>Hello, Lisa?
Are you there?</i>

944
01:26:59,783 --> 01:27:01,858
<i>This is Rachel,
Sam's ex-wife.</i>

945
01:27:02,408 --> 01:27:04,952
<i>There are important matters
that we have to discuss.</i>

946
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:08,087
<i>My number is
969-0475.</i>

947
01:27:08,765 --> 01:27:11,378
<i>Lisa, has Dr. Marsh
been in touch?</i>

948
01:27:11,502 --> 01:27:13,978
<i>He says it's very important
that he sees you.</i>

949
01:28:33,876 --> 01:28:37,620
Just another loose end
your father left for me to tie up.

950
01:30:51,068 --> 01:30:52,530
Where's Dr. Marsh?

951
01:30:52,936 --> 01:30:54,165
He's in there.

952
01:30:54,553 --> 01:30:57,574
- He's dead!
- Dead?

953
01:30:58,198 --> 01:31:00,372
Oh, no!
Oh, God!

954
01:31:01,608 --> 01:31:03,241
He tried to kill me!

955
01:31:15,508 --> 01:31:19,266
Stop! Stop!
Stop, you're making it worse!

956
01:31:20,052 --> 01:31:21,252
I know.

957
01:31:26,922 --> 01:31:29,858
Did you hear the news
about Grandfather and Sam?

958
01:31:30,231 --> 01:31:31,631
They burned to death.

959
01:31:32,191 --> 01:31:33,369
I'm Rachel.

960
01:31:33,909 --> 01:31:35,792
Nice to finally meet you.

961
01:31:43,202 --> 01:31:44,402
Stop it!

962
01:31:57,881 --> 01:32:00,703
Lisa!
Let me help!

963
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:04,275
I can take your fire.

964
01:32:06,054 --> 01:32:08,409
Lisa, no!
Don't!

965
01:32:08,532 --> 01:32:10,494
Don't go!
Don't go!
