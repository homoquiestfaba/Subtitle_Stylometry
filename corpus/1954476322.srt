1
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:24,737
You know, I should've
got biscuits and gravy.

2
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:28,072
I mean, technically it's
just biscuit and gravy.

3
00:03:28,073 --> 00:03:30,074
Cause it's just one
biscuit cut in half, see?

4
00:03:30,075 --> 00:03:33,344
No, even if it is
just one biscuit,

5
00:03:33,345 --> 00:03:35,046
it's still biscuits and gravy.

6
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:37,574
You know, how like one
pair of pants still pants.

7
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,451
I mean, you might want to take
it with the Whataburger folks,

8
00:03:40,452 --> 00:03:43,254
because they're selling it
as biscuit and gravy, see?

9
00:03:43,255 --> 00:03:45,156
Yeah, that, that-
that doesn't it right.

10
00:03:45,157 --> 00:03:47,492
I mean, um, what
would you call bacon

11
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:48,926
and eggs if you
only got one egg?

12
00:03:48,927 --> 00:03:51,629
- I would call it bacon and egg.
- No, you would not.

13
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,830
You would call it
bacon and eggs.

14
00:03:52,831 --> 00:03:53,931
Anybody would.

15
00:03:53,932 --> 00:03:55,466
Nobody would say, I'll
have bacon and egg.

16
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:58,169
Well, they would if
there was only one egg.

17
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:02,507
You know, goddamn,
the hell you wouldn't.

18
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:03,741
Here.

19
00:04:03,742 --> 00:04:05,977
You should read this.
You'd like it.

20
00:04:05,978 --> 00:04:07,111
I don't know, I still haven't

21
00:04:07,112 --> 00:04:08,313
read the book you
gave me last week,

22
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:09,881
or the one from the
week before that.

23
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,549
I mean, you know, I
don't read like you do.

24
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,484
Shit, I don't know anybody
that reads like you.

25
00:04:13,485 --> 00:04:15,286
Well, in college,
everybody reads like me,

26
00:04:15,287 --> 00:04:16,421
so you better get used to it.

27
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,956
Well, then I guess I
got a few weeks still.

28
00:04:18,957 --> 00:04:20,858
And I bet they don't
even read like you

29
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:22,260
either, even in college.

30
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:24,829
You know, besides, my mom sees
anymore books around the house,

31
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,597
she's going to have to
really believe I'm leaving.

32
00:04:26,598 --> 00:04:27,699
Just might kill her.

33
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,000
You know what, forget
about those two.

34
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:30,301
Read this one, you'll like it.

35
00:04:30,302 --> 00:04:31,536
It happens right here.

36
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:32,804
What, in a Whataburger?

37
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:35,807
No, jackass, in Texas.

38
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:37,008
Jim Johnson was a Texas boy.

39
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:39,811
Well, I mean, technically,
he was born in Oklahoma,

40
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:42,547
but all this stuff happens
right here in Texas.

41
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,449
You know what Jim Thompson said?

42
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,583
What did he say?

43
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:48,052
He said, there are 32
ways to tell a story,

44
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:49,787
but there's only ever one plot.

45
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:50,905
Yeah, what's that?

46
00:04:51,105 --> 00:04:53,526
That things are not what they seem.

47
00:04:55,761 --> 00:04:58,162
Well, I will sure as
shit go along with that.

48
00:04:58,163 --> 00:05:00,398
Things are most definitely
not what they seem.

49
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,900
You know, not-not
around here, anyhow.

50
00:05:02,901 --> 00:05:04,736
How's that?

51
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:08,606
Well, there's, -
there's you, for example.

52
00:05:08,607 --> 00:05:10,041
I'm not what I seem?

53
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:11,542
No, you're definitely not.

54
00:05:11,543 --> 00:05:14,746
Because you go and you put
on your coveralls, and you

55
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:16,214
fix tractors all day.

56
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,516
But then you go home, and
you read all these books,

57
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:19,650
and you know things.

58
00:05:19,651 --> 00:05:23,187
Like how-how there's
32 ways to tell story,

59
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:25,256
but there's only one plot.

60
00:05:25,257 --> 00:05:27,291
I didn't say that.
Jim Thomson said that.

61
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:30,461
Well, yeah, I know, but
you-you know, you know it.

62
00:05:30,462 --> 00:05:32,397
You know all kinds
of other stuff, too.

63
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,198
What's my girl know?

64
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:37,068
Hey.
Hey, baby, how're you?

65
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:38,536
Oh, shit, biscuits and gravy.

66
00:05:38,537 --> 00:05:40,638
- I love this stuff.
- Oh, you know, it's actually just

67
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,040
called biscuit and gravy, right?

68
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,642
What?

69
00:05:44,643 --> 00:05:46,778
Hey, Sue was just
telling me about this guy,

70
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:47,879
wrote this book here.

71
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,038
He said there was 32
ways to tell a story.

72
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:51,749
That right?

73
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,785
I did not know that.

74
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:54,952
Of course, I ain't
the one heading

75
00:05:54,953 --> 00:05:56,754
off to college like you two.

76
00:05:56,755 --> 00:05:58,623
BJ, you should read this.
I think you'd like it.

77
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,625
Yeah, happens right
here, in Texas.

78
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,326
Then what I need to read it for?

79
00:06:02,327 --> 00:06:03,728
Shit, I already know
every goddamn thing

80
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:04,796
that happens in Texas.

81
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:05,997
That's true.

82
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,265
All right, I just thought
you'd like it, is all.

83
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,800
I want to read it.

84
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,134
OK.

85
00:06:10,135 --> 00:06:13,504
You know, course we could
sit here and talk about books.

86
00:06:13,505 --> 00:06:16,674
Or, go over to
Corpus, have the best

87
00:06:16,675 --> 00:06:18,776
goddamn going away
party we ever had.

88
00:06:18,777 --> 00:06:20,111
I don't know, BJ.

89
00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:21,512
Now, I haven't got
the money for that.

90
00:06:21,513 --> 00:06:23,381
And besides, me and you got to
be at Giff's tomorrow morning.

91
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,249
No, I don't have any money
to be going out either.

92
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,386
Well, now, I just
might be able to do

93
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,488
a little something about that.

94
00:06:30,489 --> 00:06:32,023
Jesus Christ, where
did you get that?

95
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:33,357
I've been saving, man.

96
00:06:33,358 --> 00:06:36,527
Ever since I found out that
my best girl and my best bud

97
00:06:36,528 --> 00:06:37,562
were leaving me.

98
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,464
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

99
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:40,631
Come one, let's get
the hell out of here.

100
00:06:40,632 --> 00:06:43,001
Let's have some fun for
once, for God's sakes.

101
00:06:46,872 --> 00:06:48,105
All right.

102
00:06:48,106 --> 00:06:50,776
You have no idea what
I had to do to get this.

103
00:08:28,206 --> 00:08:29,907
Oh, it's good.

104
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:31,709
Yeah.
Good whiskey.

105
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:39,216
Man, we need to get laid.

106
00:08:39,217 --> 00:08:45,189
Oh, no, that's, - that's OK.

107
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,824
Just wait right there.

108
00:08:46,825 --> 00:08:48,059
No, seriously, it's OK.

109
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,660
Hey, BJ-

110
00:08:49,661 --> 00:08:51,262
- Hi.
- Hi.

111
00:08:51,263 --> 00:08:52,330
How are you guys doing?

112
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:53,397
Just fine, how are you?

113
00:08:53,398 --> 00:08:55,666
Oh, I'm-I'm just
hanging out, you know.

114
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:56,767
Anyways, I just
want you to know,

115
00:08:56,768 --> 00:08:59,670
- do you see my friend Bobby over there?
- Yes, I do.

116
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:01,405
- Hi, how are you doing?
- Hi.

117
00:09:01,406 --> 00:09:03,608
Yeah, he's kind
of cute, isn't he?

118
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:06,611
- He's cute.
- Yeah, yeah he is.

119
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:11,882
I'll, - You know, I'll give
you $1,000 if you blow him.

120
00:09:11,883 --> 00:09:13,319
OK, fuck off.

121
00:09:16,788 --> 00:09:23,094
Here's 1500, and I get to watch.

122
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:25,997
Oh, please, give me a break.

123
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:29,600
OK, but he has to wear a rubber.

124
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:33,337
Not unless he gets to take
it off right before he shoots.

125
00:09:33,338 --> 00:09:34,705
I'm-

126
00:09:34,706 --> 00:09:37,975
Nope, nope, hey, hey BJ, I'm
really sorry for my friend.

127
00:09:37,976 --> 00:09:39,243
He's-He's had a lot to drink.

128
00:09:39,244 --> 00:09:40,678
We should get him out of here.

129
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:41,812
You want to get out of here?

130
00:09:41,813 --> 00:09:43,347
God damn, you're going
to get your dick sucked.

131
00:09:43,348 --> 00:09:44,515
I don't want to
get my dick sucked.

132
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:45,650
Yes, you do.

133
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:46,851
Every goddamn man wants
to get his dick sucked.

134
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,452
OK, now listen, girls.

135
00:09:48,453 --> 00:09:50,121
Listen, listen, it's all right.

136
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:53,724
Now, $2,000, I think that's
what's right in here.

137
00:09:53,725 --> 00:09:55,626
Somewhere around there, 2,000,
maybe a little bit more,

138
00:09:55,627 --> 00:09:57,061
maybe a little bit less.

139
00:09:57,062 --> 00:10:00,798
Not only will you
swallow, but you'll

140
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:02,066
gargle for a half a minute-

141
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:04,735
- OK, is this a joke?
- BJ, BJ, BJ, that's enough.

142
00:10:04,736 --> 00:10:06,404
Leave them alone, leave
them alone, all right.

143
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:08,005
You've been hanging
with Giff way too much.

144
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:09,306
Let's just get out
of here, come on.

145
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:11,175
Well, man, then who else
do I have to hang out with?

146
00:10:11,176 --> 00:10:13,310
All my friends are
up and leaving me.

147
00:10:13,311 --> 00:10:14,311
Ladies.

148
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:18,049
BJ.

149
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,652
You just going to
leave all this money?

150
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:23,821
Yup.

151
00:10:23,822 --> 00:10:26,857
Sorry about my friend,
he's, like I said,

152
00:10:26,858 --> 00:10:30,294
he's-he's had a
awful lot to drink.

153
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:32,163
It's OK.

154
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:33,799
Um, did you want to join us?

155
00:10:36,835 --> 00:10:38,803
You guys want anything?

156
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:42,306
I think we're probably good.

157
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:44,775
You don't actually have to
give me a blow job or anything.

158
00:10:44,776 --> 00:10:45,810
That's OK.

159
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,011
I wasn't going to,
so it's all good.

160
00:10:47,012 --> 00:10:48,779
Oh, great, sweet then.

161
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,281
It's Bobby, right?

162
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,515
Bobby, yeah.

163
00:10:51,516 --> 00:10:52,727
Nice to meet you, Bobby.

164
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,943
How much did you spend today?

165
00:11:52,944 --> 00:11:55,079
Hey, fuck money.

166
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,915
It's all about the
memories, right?

167
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,050
Right?

168
00:12:00,051 --> 00:12:06,091
these are a couple weeks-
that's all we'll have, right?

169
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:14,198
What's with you, man?

170
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:15,666
What do you mean?

171
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:17,701
How come you didn't want to
get your dick wet earlier?

172
00:12:17,702 --> 00:12:20,070
BJ.

173
00:12:20,071 --> 00:12:23,107
No reason.
Just, tired.

174
00:12:23,108 --> 00:12:26,710
That's all.
And I'm tired, too.

175
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:29,680
Why don't we hit the bed?

176
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:31,549
I'll tell you what,
Bobby, I'm not blinded.

177
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,083
I'm not buying it
for one second.

178
00:12:33,084 --> 00:12:37,721
I think there's something
else at play here.

179
00:12:37,722 --> 00:12:39,190
Like what?

180
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:40,244
Like somebody else.

181
00:12:46,898 --> 00:12:50,734
Like somebody keeping that
dick of yours on a tight leash.

182
00:12:50,735 --> 00:12:51,735
Come on.

183
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:57,575
Well, it's definitely
somebody, man.

184
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:59,376
And whoever he is,
I mean, he must

185
00:12:59,377 --> 00:13:01,814
be really, really
special, right?

186
00:13:02,647 --> 00:13:03,948
Is that it?

187
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,792
Man, you saving yourself for
a nice little college boy?

188
00:13:11,656 --> 00:13:18,462
All right, why don't we get
you dried off and into bed?

189
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,897
Yeah, let's do that.

190
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:21,265
OK.

191
00:13:21,266 --> 00:13:24,069
OK, let's go.

192
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,383
Good night, Bobby.

193
00:13:39,384 --> 00:13:41,352
Yeah, good night.
See you tomorrow.

194
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:42,353
Good night, Bob.

195
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:53,030
How much did you spend today?

196
00:13:53,031 --> 00:13:56,634
Do you know what my
daddy's last words were?

197
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,335
Bang.

198
00:13:58,336 --> 00:14:00,104
More of a sound than a word.

199
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:01,672
And technically,
he didn't say it,

200
00:14:01,673 --> 00:14:04,309
but he did make
it, with his gun.

201
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,613
Told me that one before.

202
00:14:09,614 --> 00:14:12,283
Meh, several times.

203
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:15,286
But even if you hadn't,
I would've heard it

204
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,389
just as many times
from everybody else.

205
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,561
Is that why you're leaving?

206
00:14:24,562 --> 00:14:27,431
Because the town's so small.

207
00:14:27,432 --> 00:14:30,467
It's because of my stories.

208
00:14:30,468 --> 00:14:32,136
Honey, are they
getting on your nerves?

209
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:34,271
No.

210
00:14:34,272 --> 00:14:38,710
It's not like that, I just-

211
00:14:41,746 --> 00:14:43,431
It just makes me
sad, that's all.

212
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,051
Makes me sad, too.

213
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,152
That's the point.

214
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:53,424
BJ, God, you got to get over it.

215
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:56,026
Hey, you got to get
over all that junk

216
00:14:56,027 --> 00:14:59,530
you keep stored up in
that head of yours.

217
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,098
Move on.

218
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:03,200
I mean, you stay on a bus long
enough, and you're liable-

219
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:06,170
miss your stop.

220
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:11,542
Yes, I've told you before.

221
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:12,978
Yeah, several times.

222
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,611
I'm tired, I'm
going to go to bed.

223
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:55,786
Rise and shine, turpentine.

224
00:15:55,787 --> 00:15:58,822
Hey, goddamn you,
hitting my goddamn balls.

225
00:15:58,823 --> 00:16:01,558
Listen, motherfucker, drops your cocks,
and put on your socks, man.

226
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:03,027
We're late for
the fucking party.

227
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:04,194
Hey!

228
00:16:04,195 --> 00:16:05,396
Hey, seriously, get up man.

229
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:06,463
We got to go.

230
00:16:06,464 --> 00:16:10,200
Giff's going to be
pissed as fuck, come on.

231
00:16:10,201 --> 00:16:11,201
Argh.

232
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:16,541
Lazy motherfucker, let's move.

233
00:16:59,217 --> 00:17:00,984
Something I've been
meaning to tell you,

234
00:17:00,985 --> 00:17:05,255
something, I didn't
want to say in front of Sue.

235
00:17:05,256 --> 00:17:07,524
Yeah, what's that?

236
00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:09,394
I didn't save up that money.

237
00:17:13,164 --> 00:17:16,166
Where did you get it?

238
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:18,335
I stole it from Giff.

239
00:17:18,336 --> 00:17:19,470
What?

240
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,004
Yeah, walked right
into his office.

241
00:17:21,005 --> 00:17:23,273
Took it from his safe.

242
00:17:23,274 --> 00:17:24,741
Fuck you, that's bullshit.

243
00:17:24,742 --> 00:17:25,943
Swear it.

244
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:27,077
One night, he got so drunk.

245
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:29,413
He started talking about
crazy shit, tells me,

246
00:17:29,414 --> 00:17:33,550
his favorite number, gives
me a whole spiel about it.

247
00:17:33,551 --> 00:17:35,552
Guess what is?

248
00:17:35,553 --> 00:17:37,154
69.

249
00:17:37,155 --> 00:17:38,789
I mean, he fucking
loves that number.

250
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,024
Says it's a symbol,
says it represents

251
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:43,127
the best in human nature.

252
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:44,962
He even has a little
saying about it.

253
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:48,732
69, I'll suck yours
if you suck mine.

254
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:50,234
Yeah, it's kind of like
it's a golden rule.

255
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,802
OK, so what the fuck's that have

256
00:17:51,803 --> 00:17:53,737
to do with you
breaking into his safe?

257
00:17:53,738 --> 00:17:58,876
Well, I figured it out.

258
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,178
It's his pin number.

259
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:06,483
It's also his Powerball
number, 696969.

260
00:18:06,484 --> 00:18:08,952
Well, there's only
five numbers, so,

261
00:18:08,953 --> 00:18:12,122
the rest of it depends on
what he's feeling that day,

262
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:14,224
but, most importantly, it's-

263
00:18:14,225 --> 00:18:16,059
The combo to his safe.

264
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,494
Yup.

265
00:18:17,495 --> 00:18:19,663
It's gotta be the dumbest
thing I ever heard.

266
00:18:19,664 --> 00:18:21,366
Yeah, kind of serves him right.

267
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,560
Can't believe
you stole that money.

268
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:51,997
Just don't say
anything, all right?

269
00:18:57,468 --> 00:19:01,538
Hey, you boys are late.

270
00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:03,675
You, come on, I need you.

271
00:19:19,724 --> 00:19:21,858
What the fuck, Giff?

272
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:23,460
What the fuck, yourself.

273
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:26,163
I want some answers
right now, motherfucker.

274
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:30,434
You ask that bean burrito
where my fucking money is.

275
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:32,236
Oh, your money?

276
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:34,671
My fucking money, my dinero.

277
00:19:34,672 --> 00:19:36,340
I know that much spik
speak, motherfucker.

278
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,908
Now, you fill in the rest.

279
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:40,510
You ask him where
my fucking money is.

280
00:19:40,511 --> 00:19:43,513
OK, Giff, OK.

281
00:19:43,514 --> 00:19:46,952
Ernesto, Ernesto,

282
00:19:51,322 --> 00:19:53,890
No, see, Giff, he has
no idea where it is.

283
00:19:53,891 --> 00:19:55,626
Sure he does, sure he does.

284
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:59,696
My fucking money, my
money, in my office,

285
00:19:59,697 --> 00:20:03,900
in my safe, where you fucking
broke into, motherfucker.

286
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:06,570
Now I want to know
where my fucking money is.

287
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:07,738
Wait, wait.

288
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:11,308
Ernesto, No.

289
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:12,943
Where's my fucking money, bitch?

290
00:20:12,944 --> 00:20:14,278
I could do this all day.

291
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,213
Want me to do all fucking day?

292
00:20:16,214 --> 00:20:18,215
That's enough!
I could do it all fucking day.

293
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:21,018
Is that what you want?
Where's my fucking money?

294
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:22,886
Where's my fucking money,
you son of a bitch.

295
00:20:22,887 --> 00:20:24,521
Give me my fucking money.

296
00:20:24,522 --> 00:20:25,889
I could do this all
day, motherfucker.

297
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:26,890
Stop it!

298
00:20:32,196 --> 00:20:34,865
He didn't take it.

299
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,568
Who the fuck did?

300
00:20:38,469 --> 00:20:41,938
It's not like it got up and
walked out of here on it's own.

301
00:20:41,939 --> 00:20:42,939
I did.

302
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:47,044
I took the money.

303
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,450
You took my money?

304
00:20:53,451 --> 00:20:54,451
Yeah, I took it.

305
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,661
Why?

306
00:21:04,662 --> 00:21:08,365
- Why did you do that?
- He didn't take it.

307
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:09,800
Why?

308
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:12,769
Because he was
supposed to watch you.

309
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:17,040
He was supposed to keep you from
taking my money, and he didn't.

310
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,305
Plus, I wanted you to
know how serious I am.

311
00:21:23,247 --> 00:21:25,549
You know how serious I am?

312
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:29,186
- Yes.
- Sure?

313
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:31,054
OK, good.

314
00:21:31,055 --> 00:21:32,371
Where's my fucking money?

315
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:36,628
I don't have it.

316
00:21:39,897 --> 00:21:40,897
Where is it?

317
00:21:45,069 --> 00:21:46,122
I spe-I spent it.

318
00:21:49,006 --> 00:21:55,879
Heh, heh, wait a minute.

319
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,316
OK, let me get this straight.

320
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:04,588
You blew 20 fucking
grand over the weekend?

321
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:05,655
20 grand?

322
00:22:05,656 --> 00:22:07,709
That's right hotshot,
20 fucking grand.

323
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:22,973
You know, that money you
stole, it wasn't mine.

324
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:25,842
It was my boss's.

325
00:22:25,843 --> 00:22:28,145
But I covered it for you.

326
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:32,048
Cause that's just
the kind of guy I am.

327
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:36,686
Oh, now, you know my boss is?

328
00:22:36,687 --> 00:22:39,956
I didn't know you
had a boss, Giff.

329
00:22:39,957 --> 00:22:41,658
Oh yeah, I surely do.

330
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:44,628
I surely do.

331
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:49,399
You see, a few years ago,
business wasn't so hot.

332
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,135
Almost as bad as it is today.

333
00:22:52,136 --> 00:22:55,605
I had a third mortgage to
cover, and-well, there

334
00:22:55,606 --> 00:22:59,109
wasn't a bank in the world
that was going to cover my ass.

335
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,345
So I took out a loan.

336
00:23:02,346 --> 00:23:04,881
Kind of the way you did.

337
00:23:04,882 --> 00:23:08,718
The guy who loaned me
that money became my boss,

338
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:10,255
cause I couldn't pay it back.

339
00:23:13,524 --> 00:23:14,630
His name was Big Red.

340
00:23:16,994 --> 00:23:18,152
You ever heard of him?

341
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:25,031
Sure you have, everybody's
heard of Big Red.

342
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,041
Big fucking Red.

343
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:40,617
I- I understand, Giff,
but I don't have any money.

344
00:23:40,618 --> 00:23:45,889
Well, it's a good thing I
know where to get it then.

345
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:48,391
All right, here's the deal.

346
00:23:48,392 --> 00:23:50,627
Now, you know about
my boss right?

347
00:23:50,628 --> 00:23:52,395
Good.

348
00:23:52,396 --> 00:23:55,265
What you probably
can't imagine is

349
00:23:55,266 --> 00:23:56,967
I hate working for
that motherfucker,

350
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:59,903
almost as much as you
hate working for me.

351
00:23:59,904 --> 00:24:04,574
And this weekend, while you were
out spending all that money,

352
00:24:04,575 --> 00:24:10,614
I was stuck alone,
at home, thinking.

353
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,517
It's all I could do, was think.

354
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:15,552
And the thinking I did.

355
00:24:15,553 --> 00:24:18,688
Mostly, I was thinking about
what to do with el rigor muerto

356
00:24:18,689 --> 00:24:21,958
out there, cause I
thought he had done it.

357
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:26,029
Then, then I come
up with something.

358
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,999
Something that
was more than just

359
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,969
me feeding his balls
to his brother.

360
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,673
I came up with a plan.

361
00:24:36,674 --> 00:24:39,843
Now, you may have noticed that
the first Sunday of every month

362
00:24:39,844 --> 00:24:42,612
that red truck comes
into the cotton gin.

363
00:24:42,613 --> 00:24:45,315
What you might not have
noticed is that they drop off

364
00:24:45,316 --> 00:24:48,518
cash, whole lot of
cash, Big Red's cash.

365
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:50,120
And then on the
following Wednesday,

366
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:52,357
that truck returns
to pick up said cash.

367
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,994
Why?

368
00:24:57,995 --> 00:25:02,766
Big Red launders the money
through the cotton gin.

369
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,869
So you see, what
you're going to do

370
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:10,540
is you're going to steal that
money before the next pick up.

371
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:12,008
Wait, what?

372
00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:15,245
Just like what
you done on Friday.

373
00:25:15,246 --> 00:25:19,349
Just the load's going to
be a hell of a lot bigger.

374
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,350
Yes.

375
00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:27,657
I was, going to scare the
quesadilla in to doing it.

376
00:25:27,658 --> 00:25:30,560
But then, this happened, and
well, you got half a chromosome

377
00:25:30,561 --> 00:25:35,599
on him, easy, so that'll
make things good for us.

378
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:41,172
Now, you-did you
help spend that money?

379
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:46,911
No, yes.

380
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,347
Did you help spend that money?

381
00:25:57,054 --> 00:25:59,789
Well, I'll be damned.

382
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:02,659
That makes you an accessory.

383
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,495
And if you could spend that
money, you sure as shit

384
00:26:05,496 --> 00:26:08,999
could steal it, right?

385
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Yup, boss.

386
00:26:16,674 --> 00:26:17,674
Who else?

387
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:22,579
Who else helped you?

388
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,315
There ain't no way you two
tards could spend that money

389
00:26:25,316 --> 00:26:29,219
on your own, had to be somebody
else there to help you.

390
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,320
Who was it?

391
00:26:30,321 --> 00:26:31,721
No, Giff, see, it was just us.

392
00:26:31,722 --> 00:26:34,512
Children should be seen,
and not heard, motherfucker.

393
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,927
Giff, I don't know
what to tell you-

394
00:26:37,928 --> 00:26:39,095
Do you have any
doubts that I will

395
00:26:39,096 --> 00:26:41,698
blow your fucking brains
all over this office?

396
00:26:41,699 --> 00:26:43,735
You have any fucking doubt?

397
00:26:46,437 --> 00:26:49,005
It was-yes, Sue, OK.

398
00:26:49,006 --> 00:26:50,006
Sue?

399
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:54,411
Good, old Sue.

400
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:32,282
Motherfucker.

401
00:27:36,754 --> 00:27:37,754
Come on.

402
00:27:48,632 --> 00:27:50,033
Sue is going to kill you.

403
00:27:50,034 --> 00:27:53,536
I very much doubt
Sue's going to kill me.

404
00:27:53,537 --> 00:27:56,172
On the other hand, man,
I'm not so sure about Giff.

405
00:27:56,173 --> 00:27:58,908
Why the fuck did you have
to open your goddamn mouth?

406
00:27:58,909 --> 00:28:00,944
He was beating him to death.

407
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:05,515
Well, you sure as shit stopped
that by getting him shot.

408
00:28:05,516 --> 00:28:06,984
Jesus Christ.

409
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:12,822
Fuck it.

410
00:28:12,823 --> 00:28:14,139
Come on, help me with it.

411
00:28:57,601 --> 00:28:58,968
I don't understand.

412
00:28:58,969 --> 00:29:01,404
Hey, college boy, come on,
help me out with this shit.

413
00:29:01,405 --> 00:29:03,807
It's like you said, you
stole Giff's fingers.

414
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:05,708
No need to point fingers.
We've got to move on.

415
00:29:05,709 --> 00:29:07,811
We're well passed
the blame game.

416
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:11,748
OK, abra-fucking-cadabra,
Giff's money went poof.

417
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:13,683
Now, we have to replace it.

418
00:29:13,684 --> 00:29:15,585
Lucky for us, a man named
Big Red just so happens

419
00:29:15,586 --> 00:29:17,720
to launder money
through the cotton gin.

420
00:29:17,721 --> 00:29:20,323
So all we have to do is steal
that money before his truck

421
00:29:20,324 --> 00:29:21,457
comes to pick it
up on Wednesday.

422
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:23,827
- The end.
- Thank you, Bobby.

423
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:25,461
That much I got.

424
00:29:25,462 --> 00:29:28,131
Now, what I didn't get,
and what I still don't get,

425
00:29:28,132 --> 00:29:30,099
is why the hell I
have to steal it.

426
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,868
It's all yours, partner.

427
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:37,006
Well, because old Giff
has a logic all his own.

428
00:29:37,007 --> 00:29:39,075
BJ, what the
hell does that mean?

429
00:29:39,076 --> 00:29:41,311
It means he found out that
you helped spend the money.

430
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:42,478
And according to
the book of Giff,

431
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:45,615
that makes it your duty
to help repalce it.

432
00:29:45,616 --> 00:29:47,616
And how the hell
did he find that out?

433
00:29:51,288 --> 00:29:53,356
And if we don't?

434
00:29:53,357 --> 00:29:56,726
You don't want to
go there, trust me.

435
00:29:56,727 --> 00:29:58,127
Bobby's right.

436
00:29:58,128 --> 00:29:59,729
Let's just do it.

437
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:02,065
Now, how we going to do it?

438
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:05,869
That's the next question, right?

439
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,670
We're going to need equipment.

440
00:30:07,671 --> 00:30:10,707
- Equipment?
- Yes, Sue, equipment.

441
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:15,945
Now, borrowed, my
sister's baby monitors.

442
00:30:15,946 --> 00:30:17,714
We use them as
walkies, it'll give

443
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:19,315
us the whole play by play on it.

444
00:30:19,316 --> 00:30:21,684
BJ, baby monitors
only work one way.

445
00:30:21,685 --> 00:30:23,219
Really?

446
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,154
No shit.

447
00:30:25,155 --> 00:30:28,725
And, oh yeah, my
nephew's cap guns.

448
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:33,196
We'll pull plugs, paint them
up right, make them look real.

449
00:30:33,197 --> 00:30:35,431
And for our faces, we'll
use these, you know.

450
00:30:35,432 --> 00:30:38,935
Oh, wait, are those
your sisters too?

451
00:30:38,936 --> 00:30:40,837
They sure as shit ain't mine.

452
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:42,572
Look, I'm not put
anything on my face

453
00:30:42,573 --> 00:30:44,310
that's been on her
fat, veiny ass.

454
00:30:48,746 --> 00:30:51,481
Let's just get back on track.

455
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:54,450
Now, we arrive at 6:00
in the AM on Wednesday,

456
00:30:54,451 --> 00:30:57,083
hours before Big Red's men
show up for the pick up.

457
00:31:00,315 --> 00:31:02,926
Head through the back of
the gin, mask and gloves

458
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,363
on, fake guns looking real.

459
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,235
Now there's no security,
no one's doing any rounds,

460
00:31:12,236 --> 00:31:13,868
so it shouldn't be any trouble.

461
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:22,412
Stick to the walls, and
stick to the shadows,

462
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:25,415
you should be fine.

463
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:27,550
Now, there's video
surviellance of four cameras,

464
00:31:27,551 --> 00:31:30,186
but don't worry, I
helped put them in.

465
00:31:30,187 --> 00:31:34,490
Once you get to the
monitors, just turn them off.

466
00:31:34,491 --> 00:31:38,227
From there, we'll find
a way through the gin.

467
00:31:38,228 --> 00:31:43,700
Head towards the main office,
there will be only one door.

468
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:46,859
Crack it open with the crowbar,
make it look like a break in.

469
00:31:51,008 --> 00:31:55,611
Wait-wait, wait, wait,
wait, what about the Wolfsons?

470
00:31:55,612 --> 00:31:57,313
They'll recognize me,
they go to my church.

471
00:31:57,314 --> 00:31:58,448
It'll be 6:00 AM.

472
00:31:58,449 --> 00:31:59,882
If they do show
up, lucky for you,

473
00:31:59,883 --> 00:32:02,285
you'll be wearing
my sister's nylons.

474
00:32:02,286 --> 00:32:04,422
And, I mean, you've got a gun.

475
00:32:07,624 --> 00:32:08,891
Oh my God.

476
00:32:08,892 --> 00:32:10,193
Now you go to the next room.

477
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:13,629
And you'll see a safe,
but that's not the one.

478
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:16,399
The real safe is in the
back room, to the left.

479
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,201
Bingo.
How're we supposed to get in?

480
00:32:18,202 --> 00:32:19,469
Here's the best part.

481
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,304
Norm Wolfson is
so goddamn old, he

482
00:32:21,305 --> 00:32:22,872
can't remember the combination.

483
00:32:22,873 --> 00:32:24,707
So he wrote it down
on an index card,

484
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:27,744
taped to the bottom of his desk.

485
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:32,648
Star, 33, 26, 15, pound.

486
00:32:32,649 --> 00:32:34,617
You'll find two bags.

487
00:32:34,618 --> 00:32:39,522
Peek inside and you shall find
them packed, with clean green.

488
00:32:39,523 --> 00:32:42,425
If so, get the fuck out.

489
00:32:42,426 --> 00:32:44,927
- And that's it?
- That's It.

490
00:32:44,928 --> 00:32:46,195
What about the money?

491
00:32:46,196 --> 00:32:49,098
Oh yeah, we give it back
to Giff, we're good to go.

492
00:32:49,099 --> 00:32:55,271
- This Wednesday?
- Yeah, three days from now, 6:00 AM.

493
00:32:55,272 --> 00:32:57,740
So what do you say?

494
00:32:57,741 --> 00:33:00,043
What is there to say?

495
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:01,544
That's the spirit.

496
00:33:01,545 --> 00:33:04,814
Now, I've got to go get
some walkie talkies,

497
00:33:04,815 --> 00:33:06,883
you want to come with?

498
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:10,186
I'll pass, I'm all tuckered out.

499
00:33:10,187 --> 00:33:11,254
How about you?

500
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:13,489
Naw, naw, you
know, I should go home.

501
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:14,557
See my mom.

502
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:15,892
Haven't seen her since Corpus.

503
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:16,893
Okey dokie.

504
00:33:27,838 --> 00:33:30,706
Need a lift?

505
00:33:30,707 --> 00:33:32,602
I'm all right, I'm
going to walk it.

506
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:35,179
Well, whatever you say, hoss.

507
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:41,617
Hey, Bob, see you tomorrow.

508
00:33:41,618 --> 00:33:43,519
Yeah, see you.

509
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,520
All right.

510
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:22,592
- Hey.
- Hi.

511
00:34:36,106 --> 00:34:38,007
So what are we going to do?

512
00:34:38,008 --> 00:34:40,776
I don't know.

513
00:34:40,777 --> 00:34:41,878
I mean, I know
what we should do.

514
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:45,314
We should call the police.

515
00:34:45,315 --> 00:34:47,283
You don't think so?

516
00:34:47,284 --> 00:34:48,985
No, I thought we should've.

517
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:51,621
I've been thinking it all day.

518
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:54,056
Then what now?

519
00:34:54,057 --> 00:34:57,727
Now, I know we should.

520
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:58,728
So you'll do it?

521
00:35:19,216 --> 00:35:20,183
No-

522
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:21,250
- Why?
- No, Bobby don't.

523
00:35:21,251 --> 00:35:22,852
- We can't do this.
- Why?

524
00:35:22,853 --> 00:35:24,117
Because it'll kill him.

525
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:48,798
BJ, is that you?

526
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:50,766
Yeah, buddy, it's me.

527
00:37:50,767 --> 00:37:53,469
Just go back to bed, OK?

528
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:54,470
OK.

529
00:37:58,408 --> 00:37:59,842
Say your prayers?

530
00:37:59,843 --> 00:38:02,311
Yes.

531
00:38:02,312 --> 00:38:03,312
Good boy.

532
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:23,132
Hello, yeah.

533
00:38:23,133 --> 00:38:27,705
Hey, Giff, it's, it's me.

534
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:50,726
Well, well, little Bobby Jones.

535
00:38:50,727 --> 00:38:53,696
What can I do you for,
little Bobby Jones?

536
00:38:53,697 --> 00:38:57,099
I just, um, need to
talk to you, Sheriff.

537
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,567
You need to talk to me?

538
00:38:58,568 --> 00:39:00,836
Yeah, that's right,
I need to talk to you.

539
00:39:00,837 --> 00:39:04,141
OK, well, get to talking.

540
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:14,550
OK, well, the thing
is what I need you to-

541
00:39:14,551 --> 00:39:16,118
Do you want to talk
to me in my office?

542
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:17,219
Yeah, yeah, sure.

543
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,254
Just come on, right over there.

544
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:22,324
Claire, buzz him in, thank you.

545
00:39:22,325 --> 00:39:23,431
I'll be in my office.

546
00:39:25,395 --> 00:39:26,996
- Come on.
- OK.

547
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:29,089
- Right in here.
- All right, thank you.

548
00:39:32,469 --> 00:39:36,071
Bobby, here's the thing.

549
00:39:36,072 --> 00:39:38,507
You tell me you
need to talk to me.

550
00:39:38,508 --> 00:39:39,575
That's right.

551
00:39:39,576 --> 00:39:41,844
Yeah, well, see,
that's a funny thing,

552
00:39:41,845 --> 00:39:45,414
needs-about what we need.

553
00:39:45,415 --> 00:39:47,349
What do you mean?

554
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:50,119
Well, what I mean is, a lot
of the time, what we think

555
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,254
we need, it's not
what we need at all.

556
00:39:52,255 --> 00:39:54,590
You know what I'm saying?

557
00:39:54,591 --> 00:39:56,926
No.

558
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,562
All right, take me, for example.

559
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:03,532
For the longest
time, I thought what

560
00:40:03,533 --> 00:40:08,771
I needed was this little
19-year-old Mexican stripper I

561
00:40:08,772 --> 00:40:10,206
had on the side.

562
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:15,911
Heh, heh, heh-on the
side of Mrs. Sheriff.

563
00:40:15,912 --> 00:40:19,248
Man, I really
thought I needed her.

564
00:40:19,249 --> 00:40:22,017
I mean, like I was going to
bust if I didn't have her.

565
00:40:22,018 --> 00:40:27,256
I mean, I really thought-
I believed I needed it.

566
00:40:27,257 --> 00:40:30,125
The thing is, Bobby, I didn't.

567
00:40:30,126 --> 00:40:33,596
What I needed was to not be
paying a shit ton of alimony

568
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,865
to Mrs. Sheriff.

569
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:37,066
You following me?

570
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:38,534
Ye-yeah.

571
00:40:38,535 --> 00:40:43,373
N- no, I'm, I'm
sorry, I'm not sure.

572
00:40:46,009 --> 00:40:50,746
I truly did not
need to be paying

573
00:40:50,747 --> 00:40:53,249
the alimony I'm paying now.

574
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:58,621
Alimony that has caused me all
manner of poor and compromising

575
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:02,424
decision making, and
questionable dealings.

576
00:41:02,425 --> 00:41:07,663
I did not need to be chasing
that little Mexican tail.

577
00:41:07,664 --> 00:41:10,733
I wanted to.

578
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:12,234
I didn't need to.

579
00:41:12,235 --> 00:41:14,136
I didn't need it.

580
00:41:14,137 --> 00:41:15,804
OK.

581
00:41:15,805 --> 00:41:17,407
OK, you're following me then.

582
00:41:22,512 --> 00:41:27,850
Well, no, um, no, I'm sorry,
I don't-I don't exactly.

583
00:41:27,851 --> 00:41:30,486
I mean, I understand
that you got divorced.

584
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:33,923
I mean, that sucks.

585
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:38,360
I'm real sorry about that.

586
00:41:38,361 --> 00:41:41,830
OK, Bobby
shit-for-brains, I guess

587
00:41:41,831 --> 00:41:47,436
I'm just going to have to
spell it out for you, ain't I?

588
00:41:47,437 --> 00:41:50,973
Give you the short bus version.

589
00:41:50,974 --> 00:41:52,908
I guess so.

590
00:41:52,909 --> 00:42:00,282
The point is you come here
saying you need to talk to me.

591
00:42:00,283 --> 00:42:01,283
That's right.

592
00:42:04,287 --> 00:42:08,924
What I'm saying
is that you might

593
00:42:08,925 --> 00:42:13,730
just be mistaken, like I was.

594
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:21,770
Maybe,

595
00:42:21,771 --> 00:42:23,456
you need to keep your promises.

596
00:42:26,109 --> 00:42:31,747
Do what you say you're
going to do, for the people

597
00:42:31,748 --> 00:42:33,485
you say you're
going to do it for.

598
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:39,890
Are you following me?

599
00:42:45,895 --> 00:42:47,431
You still need to talk to me?

600
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:28,370
Get in.

601
00:43:30,907 --> 00:43:32,041
Oh, hey, Giff.

602
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:36,378
Um, no, you know, I was
just going to walk it.

603
00:43:36,379 --> 00:43:37,913
Naw, I could use the fresh air.

604
00:43:37,914 --> 00:43:40,072
What you could use
is a ride in my truck.

605
00:43:42,385 --> 00:43:44,017
I ain't going to ask you again.

606
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:15,484
You know, I've been spending a
lot of time with your boy, BJ.

607
00:44:15,485 --> 00:44:19,588
And I'm thinking, what with you
and Sue going off to college,

608
00:44:19,589 --> 00:44:22,825
that's he's feeling
kind of left out.

609
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:27,196
I mean, I don't mean
to get all pshycological

610
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:28,464
and all that stuff.

611
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:31,800
But, you know, the little
bastard never had a daddy.

612
00:44:31,801 --> 00:44:36,071
I think somebody,
with a Ph.D. and a goatee,

613
00:44:36,072 --> 00:44:38,774
might say that I fill
that void for him.

614
00:44:38,775 --> 00:44:40,676
And when he looks
at me for guidance

615
00:44:40,677 --> 00:44:43,412
and what not, and any-
doesn't fucking matter.

616
00:44:43,413 --> 00:44:46,582
The point is over
the past year, I've

617
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:48,083
gotten to know him pretty good.

618
00:44:48,084 --> 00:44:52,254
Nothing like you, you got
17 years on me and all that.

619
00:44:52,255 --> 00:44:55,992
I think we can safely say
that you are a BJ expert.

620
00:44:59,028 --> 00:45:01,964
You get to say that, BJ expert.

621
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:05,534
Hmph, well, what I was
hoping that maybe we

622
00:45:05,535 --> 00:45:10,172
could use your expertise here
to insure a hypothetical,

623
00:45:10,173 --> 00:45:12,307
which really isn't
a hypthetical.

624
00:45:12,308 --> 00:45:13,730
It's more like a potential.

625
00:45:16,562 --> 00:45:18,647
What do you think BJ
would do if he ever

626
00:45:18,648 --> 00:45:20,884
found out about you
and his girl, Sue?

627
00:45:25,588 --> 00:45:29,725
I'm not sure what you're
talking about, Giff.

628
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:31,693
Well, don't lie to me, son.

629
00:45:31,694 --> 00:45:33,896
Ten to one, I sniff that
metal digit of yours,

630
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:38,066
I'm going to get a whiff of
Sue, which, to be perfectly

631
00:45:38,067 --> 00:45:41,804
honest with you, sounds
pretty damn good about now.

632
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:45,941
But I digress and I repeat.

633
00:45:45,942 --> 00:45:49,444
What do you think BJ would
do if he ever found out

634
00:45:49,445 --> 00:45:54,183
you were wetting your
finger with his girl, Sue?

635
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:57,519
Well, I-I wouldn't
want to know, Giff.

636
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,690
Cause it ain't true.

637
00:46:02,818 --> 00:46:04,693
Boy, you sure as
shit like to gamble

638
00:46:04,694 --> 00:46:08,564
for somebody with such
a shit poker face.

639
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:10,833
That's OK, I like gambling too.

640
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:16,572
Hey, that's what they
call commonality.

641
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:18,974
We share something.

642
00:46:18,975 --> 00:46:23,612
If we wanted to, we
could bond over it.

643
00:46:23,613 --> 00:46:24,613
Sure.

644
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:31,854
You know-

645
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:41,997
You know, I'm sort of
getting the feeling

646
00:46:41,998 --> 00:46:44,104
that you're on the
fence about Wednesday.

647
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:51,840
I'm also getting the feeling
that you might be deciding

648
00:46:51,841 --> 00:46:55,110
to share your feelings with
someone outside the circle,

649
00:46:55,111 --> 00:46:58,648
about what's going on
inside said circle.

650
00:47:01,551 --> 00:47:08,757
Look, Giff, um, I
haven't said a word.

651
00:47:08,758 --> 00:47:10,325
Now, whatever you
do this Wednesday,

652
00:47:10,326 --> 00:47:14,897
um, I'm not going
to tell anybody.

653
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:16,999
OK, why would you?

654
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,735
I ain't going to be
doing anything Wednesday.

655
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:25,842
The doing is going to be done
by you, and BJ, and Sue, right?

656
00:47:34,584 --> 00:47:35,584
You hear that?

657
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:42,858
Sounds like game time to me.

658
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:44,017
Bring in the mamacita.

659
00:47:46,462 --> 00:47:48,365
Let the games begin.

660
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:56,772
Wait-

661
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:04,830
Well, with a mouth like
that, who needs an asshole?

662
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:10,152
Fuck you.

663
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:16,992
All right, well,
that's not the game, dear.

664
00:48:16,993 --> 00:48:19,895
Thank you for the offer, though.

665
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:22,965
Speaking of offers,
I like to call

666
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:27,602
this one what's your price.

667
00:48:27,603 --> 00:48:29,404
Rules of the game
are very simple.

668
00:48:29,405 --> 00:48:33,408
I make an offer, the contestant
can either accept it, or not.

669
00:48:33,409 --> 00:48:35,243
If they do, they get paid.

670
00:48:35,244 --> 00:48:37,112
If they don't, they don't.

671
00:48:37,113 --> 00:48:38,113
Get it?

672
00:48:40,783 --> 00:48:41,783
Got it?

673
00:48:44,487 --> 00:48:45,954
Good.

674
00:48:45,955 --> 00:48:48,458
Contestant number
one, that's you, Sue.

675
00:48:52,695 --> 00:48:56,932
$50, if you suck this
bean eater's burrito dry.

676
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:58,200
Fuck you.

677
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:02,471
No, no, no, baby, I
said that's not the game.

678
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:07,843
The game is

679
00:49:07,844 --> 00:49:10,947
$100, if you fuck him
till his pecker falls off.

680
00:49:13,649 --> 00:49:14,649
No?

681
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:20,655
200?

682
00:49:20,656 --> 00:49:21,656
3?

683
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,560
$400?

684
00:49:30,433 --> 00:49:37,339
$400, $400, going
once, going twice,

685
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,841
not sold to the
fucking potty mouth

686
00:49:39,842 --> 00:49:42,711
with the very, very bad manners.

687
00:49:42,712 --> 00:49:45,213
You know, it's all right.

688
00:49:45,214 --> 00:49:47,182
I kind of had a feeling
you wouldn't accept,

689
00:49:47,183 --> 00:49:49,451
and I'm very glad you
didn't disappoint.

690
00:49:49,452 --> 00:49:53,655
Because, well,
round two is always

691
00:49:53,656 --> 00:49:56,792
so much more fun than round one.

692
00:49:56,793 --> 00:50:00,295
Contestant number two, Pedro.

693
00:50:00,296 --> 00:50:05,602
$400, if you drop trou and fuck
this bitch dry, right here.

694
00:50:15,511 --> 00:50:17,012
OK!

695
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:18,448
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

696
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,922
OK, what?

697
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:30,325
OK, I'll do it.

698
00:50:30,326 --> 00:50:31,327
You'll do what?

699
00:50:34,163 --> 00:50:37,899
This Wednesday, I'll do it.

700
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:43,305
And that is how you
play what is your price.

701
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:46,274
I guess we found out
yours, didn't we?

702
00:50:46,275 --> 00:50:48,376
OK, so let me get this straight.

703
00:50:48,377 --> 00:50:51,246
You got two days to
get your shit together,

704
00:50:51,247 --> 00:50:53,782
and if you don't follow
through, well, I'm

705
00:50:53,783 --> 00:50:55,317
going to do more to your
sweet pea than hollow

706
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:56,453
out her honey hole.

707
00:50:59,388 --> 00:51:00,388
You follow?

708
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,226
Get.

709
00:51:11,567 --> 00:51:12,869
Same goes for you, baby.

710
00:51:18,908 --> 00:51:20,343
Let's go, boys.

711
00:51:31,854 --> 00:51:32,854
You OK?

712
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:33,582
You OK?

713
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,854
How about you?

714
00:52:39,855 --> 00:52:40,855
Yeah.

715
00:52:48,764 --> 00:52:53,068
You know, I, um,
I've been thinking.

716
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:54,970
Yeah?

717
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:58,273
About what?

718
00:52:58,274 --> 00:53:01,743
I think we should
take the money and run.

719
00:53:01,744 --> 00:53:02,911
Are you serious?

720
00:53:02,912 --> 00:53:04,546
Yeah, don't give a
goddamned nickel to Giff.

721
00:53:04,547 --> 00:53:06,781
Just, you know, grab the
loot, and never look back.

722
00:53:06,782 --> 00:53:10,051
Bobby, if we do that, all
we'll ever do is look back.

723
00:53:10,052 --> 00:53:13,121
Over our shoulders, every
step of the way, until Giff,

724
00:53:13,122 --> 00:53:15,558
or Big Red, or worse,
catches up with us.

725
00:53:26,035 --> 00:53:30,473
I'm just, hmph, I'm
just saying, is all.

726
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:35,210
I know.

727
00:53:39,515 --> 00:53:45,320
And I'm just saying
we're already leaving.

728
00:53:45,321 --> 00:53:48,479
Let's not give this shit hole
town a reason not to let us go.

729
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:53,061
Let's just stick
to the plan, OK?

730
00:53:53,062 --> 00:53:54,996
So you're still going
to make the call?

731
00:53:54,997 --> 00:53:59,000
Yeah, soon as I get to
work, and get to a computer,

732
00:53:59,001 --> 00:54:01,269
I'll find the number
and I'll make the call.

733
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:03,471
You still think you got it?

734
00:54:03,472 --> 00:54:07,375
Rain falls on 32 men, right?

735
00:54:07,376 --> 00:54:09,744
OK, now, get out of here.

736
00:54:09,745 --> 00:54:11,813
You'll make me late for work.

737
00:54:11,814 --> 00:54:12,814
Right.

738
00:55:13,676 --> 00:55:15,076
Is there anyone

739
00:55:15,077 --> 00:55:18,880
listening to me who doesn't wish
they could change their past?

740
00:55:18,881 --> 00:55:20,516
Re-write their own life story?

741
00:55:23,285 --> 00:55:27,489
Hey, you.
Hey, you, back.

742
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,991
Thinking about a
phone call I got today.

743
00:55:29,992 --> 00:55:32,762
Oh, was it a man?

744
00:55:34,263 --> 00:55:35,597
Not hardly.

745
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:37,465
It was Ms. Betty.

746
00:55:37,466 --> 00:55:40,068
What did she want?

747
00:55:40,069 --> 00:55:43,772
To congratulate me and you.

748
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:45,306
For what?

749
00:55:45,307 --> 00:55:49,644
Well, she heard you were
going away to college.

750
00:55:49,645 --> 00:55:51,546
I told her she was mistaken.

751
00:55:51,547 --> 00:55:53,948
We don't have any college
boys in this house, just

752
00:55:53,949 --> 00:55:56,785
cotton boys.

753
00:55:56,786 --> 00:56:00,723
Yeah, yeah, you should
be real proud of that.

754
00:56:07,863 --> 00:56:11,733
Jesus Christ, BJ, what the fuck?

755
00:56:11,734 --> 00:56:14,202
Want to know what
I'm doing here?

756
00:56:14,203 --> 00:56:16,572
Why I climbed through
your window unannounced?

757
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:24,412
We need to talk.

758
00:56:24,413 --> 00:56:26,681
We need to talk?

759
00:56:26,682 --> 00:56:27,682
We do, indeed.

760
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:33,084
What we need to talk
about, it's important.

761
00:56:35,624 --> 00:56:37,158
How important?

762
00:56:37,159 --> 00:56:38,526
Shit, man, I climbed
through your window

763
00:56:38,527 --> 00:56:39,685
unannounced important.

764
00:56:41,864 --> 00:56:42,864
Is it bad?

765
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:48,638
Well, partner, it ain't good.

766
00:56:56,779 --> 00:56:57,779
Millers.

767
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:05,690
Hey, Sue, you've
got a phone call.

768
00:57:21,136 --> 00:57:23,571
- Hello.
- Hey, they're moving it up.

769
00:57:23,572 --> 00:57:24,806
Moving what up?

770
00:57:24,807 --> 00:57:26,040
Tomorrow.

771
00:57:26,041 --> 00:57:27,075
To when?

772
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:28,109
To midnight, tonight.

773
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:29,110
Tonight?

774
00:57:34,563 --> 00:57:36,017
Did you tell him anything?

775
00:57:36,018 --> 00:57:38,286
Who?

776
00:57:38,287 --> 00:57:40,054
BJ, who do you think?

777
00:57:40,055 --> 00:57:42,257
No, tell him what?

778
00:57:42,258 --> 00:57:44,025
About us?

779
00:57:44,026 --> 00:57:46,261
What, of course not.
Why would I do that?

780
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:47,896
I don't know, to beat me to it?

781
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:50,798
Bobby, are you serious?
You think I'd do that?

782
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:53,968
No, shit.

783
00:57:53,969 --> 00:57:55,069
OK, it's fine.

784
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:59,340
Let's just, this
could be good, right?

785
00:57:59,341 --> 00:58:01,920
I mean, we don't know, it
might not be bad, right?

786
00:58:25,968 --> 00:58:27,653
Can you hand me a towel, please?

787
00:59:19,421 --> 00:59:23,424
Hot damn, you really
read all this shit?

788
00:59:23,425 --> 00:59:24,626
Is that a joke?

789
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:27,061
It's a question,
don't get so defensive.

790
00:59:27,062 --> 00:59:29,964
It's a stupid question.
Why else would I have them?

791
00:59:29,965 --> 00:59:31,544
I don't know, for decoration.

792
00:59:36,972 --> 00:59:41,743
OK, smarty pants,
what's this one about?

793
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:44,712
It's about a family curse,
a stolen emerald necklace,

794
00:59:44,713 --> 00:59:46,848
an unidentified body
found in a squire's grave,

795
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:49,083
and a family tradition involving
a nine hour bell ringing

796
00:59:49,084 --> 00:59:51,352
ceremony to kick
off the new year.

797
00:59:51,353 --> 00:59:55,023
It's over long,
arguably unreadable,

798
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:57,425
but it's a well written
sequence involving redemption.

799
00:59:57,426 --> 00:59:59,293
What about this one?

800
00:59:59,294 --> 01:00:02,463
Oh, this?

801
01:00:02,464 --> 01:00:05,066
This is-well,
maybe not technically

802
01:00:05,067 --> 01:00:08,236
the best, but hands down my
favorite in the Nero Wolfe series.

803
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:10,204
It's, it's about a chess master

804
01:00:10,205 --> 01:00:12,206
murdered by poisonous
hot chocolate.

805
01:00:12,207 --> 01:00:15,743
But the twist is he's not
the real intended victim.

806
01:00:15,744 --> 01:00:17,245
The real intended
victim is the man

807
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:18,846
who is serving the
hot chocolate, a man

808
01:00:18,847 --> 01:00:20,348
by the name of
Blounce something.

809
01:00:20,349 --> 01:00:22,316
So he's arrested and
charged with murder,

810
01:00:22,317 --> 01:00:24,819
because all the evidence
points to him, which

811
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:27,221
was the real killer's
plan all along.

812
01:00:27,222 --> 01:00:30,159
So like the title, the murder
turns out to be a gambit.

813
01:00:38,934 --> 01:00:40,968
I just realized.

814
01:00:40,969 --> 01:00:43,204
What's that?

815
01:00:43,205 --> 01:00:48,042
We're a lot alike, you and me.

816
01:00:48,043 --> 01:00:50,378
Oh, come on.

817
01:00:50,379 --> 01:00:54,549
I know you don't want to
admit it, but it's true.

818
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:58,720
Most people don't know who the fuck
they are, what the fuck they want.

819
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:00,188
But not us?

820
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:01,756
Not us.

821
01:01:01,757 --> 01:01:06,027
I think some go to college
to figure this shit out.

822
01:01:06,028 --> 01:01:07,729
Others, you know, travel.

823
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:11,399
Go backpacking to places where
pot and prostitution are legal,

824
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,167
all in the name
of self discovery

825
01:01:13,168 --> 01:01:16,471
or whatever the fuck
you want to call it.

826
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:21,175
But not you, not me.

827
01:01:21,176 --> 01:01:23,311
We're the exceptions.

828
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:26,547
Though, you're going to college.

829
01:01:26,548 --> 01:01:28,382
To get the hell
out of this place.

830
01:01:28,383 --> 01:01:30,618
Oh, yeah, yeah, to get of here.

831
01:01:30,619 --> 01:01:33,287
Partly, I don't, I don't
doubt that for a second.

832
01:01:33,288 --> 01:01:36,791
I mean, you always were too
good for the rest of us.

833
01:01:36,792 --> 01:01:41,429
But the real reason is
cause you know who you are,

834
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:45,399
what you want, how to get it.

835
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:49,337
I mean, you want to
be a writer, right?

836
01:01:49,338 --> 01:01:52,007
Write books and shit,
mysteries like these.

837
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:58,846
Come on, honey,
don't act so shocked.

838
01:01:58,847 --> 01:02:01,315
I remember.

839
01:02:01,316 --> 01:02:03,518
I remember everything
you ever told

840
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,753
me, every motherfucking word.

841
01:02:05,754 --> 01:02:09,056
And I think about it a lot.

842
01:02:09,057 --> 01:02:13,461
And maybe that's
lame, but it's true.

843
01:02:13,462 --> 01:02:15,630
You know what else is true?

844
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:20,436
I know who I am, what I
want, and how to get it.

845
01:02:36,885 --> 01:02:37,885
Know who doesn't?

846
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:43,090
Bobby.

847
01:02:45,861 --> 01:02:48,362
That's who.

848
01:02:48,363 --> 01:02:57,205
Now, don't get me wrong,
he's smart, book smart.

849
01:02:57,206 --> 01:03:02,076
So he's going to college,
well, whoop-de-dee-fucking-doo.

850
01:03:02,077 --> 01:03:04,512
Well, not me.

851
01:03:04,513 --> 01:03:08,082
Whole reason why I'm not
going to college or going

852
01:03:08,083 --> 01:03:13,221
backpacking, it's not
because I ain't got the money

853
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:17,158
or the book smarts,
because I don't.

854
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:23,731
But the real reason is just
like you I know who I am,

855
01:03:23,732 --> 01:03:28,636
what I want, how to get it.

856
01:03:28,637 --> 01:03:33,474
None of those things
are a part of the plan.

857
01:03:33,475 --> 01:03:35,002
So what is part of the plan?

858
01:03:37,846 --> 01:03:39,268
Wouldn't you like to know?

859
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:42,603
That's why I asked.

860
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:47,755
Hear about tonight?

861
01:03:47,756 --> 01:03:48,756
No.

862
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:55,997
We're doing it at 12, midnight,
instead of tomorrow at six.

863
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:57,899
It's as far as I could push it.

864
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,800
How would've I have
heard about that?

865
01:03:59,801 --> 01:04:02,837
I don't know, thought you might
have heard from a little bird

866
01:04:02,838 --> 01:04:03,905
by the name of Bobby.

867
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:07,541
Maybe you two met up
at the Whataburger,

868
01:04:07,542 --> 01:04:10,845
had a little fun day.

869
01:04:10,846 --> 01:04:15,816
Well, anyways, times
may have changed,

870
01:04:15,817 --> 01:04:17,551
but the plans stay the same.

871
01:04:17,552 --> 01:04:19,154
OK, tonight, I got it.

872
01:04:28,697 --> 01:04:30,933
You should go.

873
01:04:39,908 --> 01:04:40,908
What if I don't?

874
01:04:52,187 --> 01:04:56,190
That's what I always
liked about you, Sue.

875
01:04:56,191 --> 01:05:01,662
You always were,
straight shooter.

876
01:05:01,663 --> 01:05:07,201
Lately, I think it seems that
you've been hiding something.

877
01:05:07,202 --> 01:05:10,204
I can't really put
my finger on it,

878
01:05:10,205 --> 01:05:14,143
but I'm sure they smell fishy.

879
01:05:37,766 --> 01:05:38,966
Hello.

880
01:05:38,967 --> 01:05:41,936
Hi, can
I speak to Bobby, please?

881
01:05:41,937 --> 01:05:43,537
Bobby, goddamn phone.

882
01:05:43,538 --> 01:05:44,538
Coming.

883
01:05:50,312 --> 01:05:52,113
- Hello.
- Hey, it's me.

884
01:05:53,882 --> 01:05:54,882
Bobby?

885
01:05:57,152 --> 01:05:58,152
Is everything OK?

886
01:07:46,294 --> 01:07:47,495
Hi, Bobby.

887
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:48,496
Hey.

888
01:08:40,448 --> 01:08:42,349
Till seven, Bobby-rino.

889
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:43,350
Till seven.

890
01:08:46,521 --> 01:08:50,357
All right, I'm going to hang
back here as look out, OK?

891
01:08:50,358 --> 01:08:51,392
Wait, what?

892
01:08:51,393 --> 01:08:54,195
Shit, you want to
deal with the cops?

893
01:08:54,196 --> 01:08:56,197
Because if they show
up, and you're outside.

894
01:08:56,198 --> 01:08:58,866
I mean, that's where
you're getting in to, hun.

895
01:08:58,867 --> 01:09:04,004
Bob, if see anything out of the
ordinary, I'll let you know.

896
01:09:04,005 --> 01:09:05,039
Then what?

897
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,309
Look, just stick
to the fucking plan.

898
01:09:10,712 --> 01:09:12,146
Fuck it.

899
01:09:12,147 --> 01:09:15,149
Let's go.

900
01:09:15,150 --> 01:09:17,451
Jesus.

901
01:09:17,452 --> 01:09:18,720
This is fucked up.

902
01:10:45,073 --> 01:10:47,074
- Monitor's down.
- What?

903
01:10:50,286 --> 01:10:51,845
Hey, BJ, the monitor's down.

904
01:10:51,846 --> 01:10:54,848
Why the fuck are
the monitors down?

905
01:10:54,849 --> 01:10:56,050
Hey, man, don't worry about it.

906
01:10:56,051 --> 01:10:59,586
Just keep on moving, OK.

907
01:10:59,587 --> 01:11:01,023
Coast is clear out here.

908
01:11:04,059 --> 01:11:06,026
OK.

909
01:11:06,027 --> 01:11:12,467
Bobby, I don't-I have
a bad feeling about this.

910
01:11:31,419 --> 01:11:33,921
Where the the
fuck's the crowbar?

911
01:11:33,922 --> 01:11:35,422
Oh.

912
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:36,423
Look over there.

913
01:11:41,396 --> 01:11:43,497
Wait.

914
01:11:43,498 --> 01:11:45,232
- Bobby?
- What?

915
01:11:45,233 --> 01:11:46,767
- It's already open.
- What?

916
01:11:46,768 --> 01:11:47,768
It's open.

917
01:12:07,455 --> 01:12:08,956
Got it.

918
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:12,526
It's, 33, 26,-

919
01:12:12,527 --> 01:12:14,328
OK, hold on.
15.

920
01:12:17,699 --> 01:12:19,066
Bobby, the safe's empty.

921
01:12:19,067 --> 01:12:20,200
What?

922
01:12:20,201 --> 01:12:21,335
It's fucking empty.

923
01:12:21,336 --> 01:12:22,936
Wha-what do you
mean it's fucking empty?

924
01:12:22,937 --> 01:12:25,172
I mean there's not a
goddamn thing in here.

925
01:12:25,173 --> 01:12:28,909
Fuck, Bobby, just
turn on the lights.

926
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:30,811
Fuck.

927
01:12:30,812 --> 01:12:34,349
I got it.

928
01:12:39,254 --> 01:12:40,254
Holy shit.

929
01:13:01,676 --> 01:13:03,644
- Mr. Wolfson?
- Oh my God.

930
01:13:09,184 --> 01:13:12,553
OK, Sue, we got to go.

931
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:13,688
Sue, we got to go.

932
01:13:21,596 --> 01:13:25,232
BJ.

933
01:13:29,637 --> 01:13:31,438
BJ-

934
01:13:32,907 --> 01:13:33,907
What the fuck?

935
01:13:36,845 --> 01:13:40,582
You think that you're
so fucking smart.

936
01:13:44,486 --> 01:13:49,623
Both of you, I mean, you thought
you were going away together.

937
01:13:49,624 --> 01:13:51,992
Well, guess what?

938
01:13:51,993 --> 01:13:57,732
You are, but, not to
college, and not together.

939
01:14:00,502 --> 01:14:03,070
It was all part of the plan.

940
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:04,506
All of it.

941
01:14:07,909 --> 01:14:09,943
Giff came up with it.

942
01:14:09,944 --> 01:14:16,283
Right after, I
told him about you two.

943
01:14:16,284 --> 01:14:20,220
After I told him what you've
been doing behind my back.

944
01:14:20,221 --> 01:14:24,691
You know what, we fixed
you, we fixed you good.

945
01:14:24,692 --> 01:14:28,362
We got you to take Big
Red's loot so we can take it

946
01:14:28,363 --> 01:14:32,467
from you, and then, well,
we'd bust you for it.

947
01:14:35,203 --> 01:14:37,771
That's the stupidest
thing I ever heard.

948
01:14:37,772 --> 01:14:38,972
Yeah?

949
01:14:38,973 --> 01:14:43,176
Well, you fell for it.

950
01:14:43,177 --> 01:14:45,045
Both of you.

951
01:14:45,046 --> 01:14:49,249
Yup, and it looks like
we're not the only ones.

952
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:51,718
Now, what the fuck
does that mean?

953
01:14:51,719 --> 01:14:59,960
It means, BJ, that if this
was all part of your plan, then

954
01:14:59,961 --> 01:15:02,698
you must've been the ones
to kill the Wolfsons right?

955
01:15:04,766 --> 01:15:07,601
What the fuck did you just say?

956
01:15:07,602 --> 01:15:09,403
What the fuck is she
talking about man?

957
01:15:09,404 --> 01:15:18,612
Listen, man, the Wolfsons
are fucking dead, OK?

958
01:15:18,613 --> 01:15:20,514
Fucking shot through
the head, dead.

959
01:15:20,515 --> 01:15:21,515
You're lying.

960
01:15:24,552 --> 01:15:26,386
Where did you put the money?

961
01:15:26,387 --> 01:15:29,690
There is no fucking money.

962
01:15:29,691 --> 01:15:31,481
Where'd you put
the fucking money?

963
01:15:33,468 --> 01:15:35,395
What'd you fucking
do with the money?

964
01:15:35,396 --> 01:15:36,730
Settle down there, BJ.

965
01:15:36,731 --> 01:15:38,532
What the fuck?

966
01:15:38,533 --> 01:15:41,835
It's in a safe place.

967
01:15:41,836 --> 01:15:43,770
It's all right.

968
01:15:43,771 --> 01:15:48,375
Hey, sweet pea.

969
01:15:48,376 --> 01:15:50,243
Give me that, son.

970
01:15:50,244 --> 01:15:53,046
Sorry, Giff, I didn't-I
didn't mean to take your gun.

971
01:15:53,047 --> 01:15:54,014
I didn't mean to.

972
01:15:54,015 --> 01:15:56,216
Now, it's all right.

973
01:15:56,217 --> 01:15:57,317
Look, I don't understand.

974
01:15:57,318 --> 01:15:59,219
They-they said the
Wolfsons are dead,

975
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:00,320
but I told them
that was bullshit.

976
01:16:00,321 --> 01:16:02,623
Because, you know,
they exist, right?

977
01:16:02,624 --> 01:16:04,725
There's no-there's no way you
would kill somebody who exists,

978
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:05,559
right?

979
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:06,593
Just fucking Mexicans, right?

980
01:16:06,594 --> 01:16:07,828
Just fucking Mexicans.

981
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:11,632
I would, I would-I would
never kill the Wolfsons.

982
01:16:11,633 --> 01:16:17,037
But they did have do die,
there's no argument there.

983
01:16:17,038 --> 01:16:19,975
They work for Big Red, you
know, loose ends and whatnot.

984
01:16:23,211 --> 01:16:25,112
I dont-I don't understand.

985
01:16:25,113 --> 01:16:26,747
Are they dead or
they ain't dead?

986
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:30,217
Oh, they are as dead as disco.

987
01:16:30,218 --> 01:16:35,922
Wait, I mean, if you didn't
kill them, who the fuck did?

988
01:16:35,923 --> 01:16:39,359
Well, you did.

989
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:40,360
No, I didn't.

990
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:43,997
I didn't-I didn't
fucking kill nobody.

991
01:16:43,998 --> 01:16:45,400
Yes, you did.

992
01:16:51,639 --> 01:16:54,441
It was you too, sweet pea.

993
01:16:54,442 --> 01:16:56,610
And you, Bobby.

994
01:16:56,611 --> 01:16:59,613
Well, you were all in
on it, and then when

995
01:16:59,614 --> 01:17:02,983
I caught you red
handed, what'd you do?

996
01:17:02,984 --> 01:17:05,052
You all put guns on me.

997
01:17:05,053 --> 01:17:08,855
I mean, come the fuck on.

998
01:17:08,856 --> 01:17:12,059
Wait, wait, Giff, look.

999
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:13,161
Not real, right?

1000
01:17:13,995 --> 01:17:15,495
Not real.

1001
01:17:15,496 --> 01:17:19,866
Yeah, that's all right.

1002
01:17:19,867 --> 01:17:22,002
I'll put a real one in
your hand after I drop you.

1003
01:17:22,003 --> 01:17:26,840
FYI, it'll be the same piece
you used on the Wolfsons.

1004
01:17:26,841 --> 01:17:29,509
But I, I-I didn't.

1005
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:30,510
Sure you did.

1006
01:17:36,050 --> 01:17:37,084
You did.

1007
01:17:37,085 --> 01:17:38,618
And I caught you in the act.

1008
01:17:38,619 --> 01:17:42,189
Well, at least that's what
I'm going to tell whoever asks

1009
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:46,660
after I call the cops to pick
up whatever is left of you two.

1010
01:17:46,661 --> 01:17:50,597
Hell, I might even get
elected sheriff for this.

1011
01:17:50,598 --> 01:17:55,003
Replace that greedy sack of
stupid waiting for his 10%.

1012
01:17:58,007 --> 01:17:59,039
Where was I, again?

1013
01:17:59,040 --> 01:17:59,873
Oh, yeah.

1014
01:17:59,874 --> 01:18:01,032
No, hold on, hold on.

1015
01:18:04,812 --> 01:18:07,013
OK, I'm waiting.

1016
01:18:07,014 --> 01:18:11,918
Big Red, I told him.

1017
01:18:11,919 --> 01:18:14,521
All right, I like games,
honey, but I don't have time-

1018
01:18:14,522 --> 01:18:17,758
No, no, no, it's not a
game, Giff, it's real.

1019
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:19,059
Oh, shit.

1020
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:23,630
I told him everything, and
he's coming here for you.

1021
01:18:23,631 --> 01:18:24,931
No, you didn't.

1022
01:18:24,932 --> 01:18:25,732
I did.

1023
01:18:25,733 --> 01:18:27,634
No, you didn't.

1024
01:18:27,635 --> 01:18:31,238
I mean, how could you?

1025
01:18:31,239 --> 01:18:32,873
I called him.

1026
01:18:32,874 --> 01:18:34,107
OK, see, right there.

1027
01:18:34,108 --> 01:18:35,709
That is the biggest
pile of steaming

1028
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:36,977
horse shit I have ever heard.

1029
01:18:36,978 --> 01:18:38,044
What do you mean you called him?

1030
01:18:38,045 --> 01:18:39,246
What did you do?

1031
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:42,082
Look him up in the Yellow
Pages, under gangster?

1032
01:18:42,083 --> 01:18:44,317
Or in the white
pages, under Red?

1033
01:18:44,318 --> 01:18:49,489
No, I Nancy Drew-ed
it, motherfucker.

1034
01:18:49,490 --> 01:18:50,791
When Big Red's
men made the drop,

1035
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:52,214
Bobby took down the plates.

1036
01:18:55,029 --> 01:18:58,665
When he told me what
happened, I got an idea.

1037
01:18:58,666 --> 01:19:00,668
Rain falls on 32 men.

1038
01:19:03,671 --> 01:19:09,075
I typed it in, and just
like that, I got a number.

1039
01:19:09,076 --> 01:19:10,677
And I called it.

1040
01:19:10,678 --> 01:19:13,513
And a man answered.

1041
01:19:13,514 --> 01:19:15,916
You know what I did?

1042
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:18,185
I did what no one ever does.

1043
01:19:18,186 --> 01:19:19,502
I told the goddamn truth.

1044
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:24,691
So he's coming here.

1045
01:19:24,692 --> 01:19:27,060
He's coming for you.

1046
01:19:27,061 --> 01:19:29,563
Armed to the teeth
with guns, and knives,

1047
01:19:29,564 --> 01:19:33,767
and whatever the medieval
fucked up bullshit he uses.

1048
01:19:33,768 --> 01:19:37,404
And that means you're fucked.

1049
01:19:37,405 --> 01:19:41,107
Now, how do I know
you ain't bluffing?

1050
01:19:41,108 --> 01:19:44,110
Because if I didn't call
him, then why the fuck did he

1051
01:19:44,111 --> 01:19:46,112
you call you and tell
you he was coming early?

1052
01:19:46,113 --> 01:19:47,113
He did?

1053
01:19:49,483 --> 01:19:50,283
Yes, he did.

1054
01:19:50,284 --> 01:19:51,284
No, he didn't.

1055
01:19:53,331 --> 01:19:54,521
Now, you're bluffing.

1056
01:19:54,522 --> 01:19:57,257
Nuh-I don't have to.

1057
01:19:57,258 --> 01:19:58,959
Already did.

1058
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,961
That's how I know
you're full of shit.

1059
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:02,229
No, Giff, it's not-

1060
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:03,129
Now you're going to die.

1061
01:20:03,130 --> 01:20:04,598
No, no, no, I did call-

1062
01:20:04,599 --> 01:20:07,601
Run!

1063
01:20:19,947 --> 01:20:21,715
Wait, wait.

1064
01:20:21,716 --> 01:20:22,716
OK.

1065
01:20:43,905 --> 01:20:45,800
Hey, you know, Big
Red never called.

1066
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:51,912
Nobody called, that was
just a bunch of bull shit.

1067
01:20:51,913 --> 01:20:55,982
Yeah, hey, you know, the only
reason I even said he called,

1068
01:20:55,983 --> 01:20:58,351
the only reason I
even moved it up,

1069
01:20:58,352 --> 01:21:01,756
was to make sure you fucktards
went through with it.

1070
01:21:08,162 --> 01:21:12,399
I must-I have to admit, I
am a little bit impatient,

1071
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:16,803
and I do like to change the
rules mid-game because it just

1072
01:21:16,804 --> 01:21:19,773
makes it so much more exciting.

1073
01:21:19,774 --> 01:21:23,143
Like in Gladiator,
when they release

1074
01:21:23,144 --> 01:21:25,612
those tigers right in
the middle of the fight.

1075
01:21:25,613 --> 01:21:29,783
Or in Rocky 2, do you
remember that one?

1076
01:21:29,784 --> 01:21:33,186
When the Southpaw learned to
fight with his right hand.

1077
01:21:33,187 --> 01:21:35,422
Oh, probably wasn't
expecting that at all.

1078
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:36,957
And what did that do?

1079
01:21:36,958 --> 01:21:39,192
It made for a better
fight, didn't it?

1080
01:21:39,193 --> 01:21:40,060
Why?

1081
01:21:40,061 --> 01:21:42,662
Because Rocky changed the rules.

1082
01:21:42,663 --> 01:21:46,434
Just like I did to
you, motherfucker.

1083
01:21:53,474 --> 01:21:57,779
I hear you.

1084
01:23:08,682 --> 01:23:09,682
Oh, that was fun.

1085
01:23:16,157 --> 01:23:22,062
Bobby, now turn that
frown upside down.

1086
01:23:22,063 --> 01:23:25,265
You are looking at
this all wrong, son.

1087
01:23:25,266 --> 01:23:27,067
And you shouldn't be
pissing your pants

1088
01:23:27,068 --> 01:23:28,401
like you are right now.

1089
01:23:28,402 --> 01:23:33,239
No, you should be-hell,
you should be thanking me.

1090
01:23:33,240 --> 01:23:35,008
Cause that's what
I'm trying to do.

1091
01:23:35,009 --> 01:23:42,749
I am trying to-I'm trying to
save you from a world of pain,

1092
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:45,620
like a three legged horse,
I am putting you down, boy.

1093
01:23:48,989 --> 01:23:51,958
Take a look at her.

1094
01:23:51,959 --> 01:23:57,430
Go on, take a good
long look at her.

1095
01:23:57,431 --> 01:24:00,033
She ain't going
to stay with you.

1096
01:24:00,034 --> 01:24:04,070
You all leaving here for
bigger and better things.

1097
01:24:04,071 --> 01:24:08,408
That's exactly what she's
going to find, Bobby.

1098
01:24:08,409 --> 01:24:09,988
No more Bobby shit-for-brains.

1099
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:15,682
She's going to get
herself a city boy.

1100
01:24:15,683 --> 01:24:20,453
With all kinds of
money, ambition, hell,

1101
01:24:20,454 --> 01:24:24,424
maybe he'll even have
a driver's license.

1102
01:24:24,425 --> 01:24:27,260
No, I'm telling you, Bobby,
she was going to leave you,

1103
01:24:27,261 --> 01:24:30,063
and she wasn't even
going to look back.

1104
01:24:30,064 --> 01:24:38,172
So, it's not like I'm killing
you, more like I'm saving you.

1105
01:24:59,894 --> 01:25:07,300
Um, Bobby, Bobby.

1106
01:25:07,301 --> 01:25:10,737
Bobby, open your eyes.

1107
01:25:10,738 --> 01:25:12,473
Bobby, open your eyes now, OK?

1108
01:25:19,547 --> 01:25:21,282
I love you.

1109
01:25:24,151 --> 01:25:26,387
Now, now, Nancy Drew.

1110
01:25:39,473 --> 01:25:40,400
Now, look at you.

1111
01:25:40,401 --> 01:25:41,401
Yeah, look at me.

1112
01:25:44,638 --> 01:25:46,940
You used to have two boyfriends,

1113
01:25:46,941 --> 01:25:48,474
and now you ain't got none.

1114
01:25:48,475 --> 01:25:50,276
Fuck you.

1115
01:25:50,277 --> 01:25:54,647
OK, very tempted, but
I can't feel anything

1116
01:25:54,648 --> 01:25:56,859
from the neck down, at
this moment in time.

1117
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:11,966
You expecting someone, baby?

1118
01:26:17,671 --> 01:26:18,771
Oh, shit.

1119
01:26:18,772 --> 01:26:19,772
Shit.

1120
01:26:22,543 --> 01:26:23,943
You Sue?

1121
01:26:23,944 --> 01:26:24,911
I am.

1122
01:26:24,912 --> 01:26:26,347
Big fucking Red.

1123
01:26:33,687 --> 01:26:37,056
Where's my money, Sue?

1124
01:26:37,057 --> 01:26:40,660
You have to take that
up with this brokeback

1125
01:26:40,661 --> 01:26:43,229
fucktard over here.

1126
01:26:43,230 --> 01:26:44,964
Is that right?

1127
01:26:44,965 --> 01:26:46,799
That's right.

1128
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,327
The money wasn't in the safe.

1129
01:26:50,971 --> 01:26:53,406
That right, Giff?

1130
01:26:53,407 --> 01:26:55,174
Are you the-how
did she put it-

1131
01:26:55,175 --> 01:26:58,379
the fucktard thats got my money?

1132
01:27:02,716 --> 01:27:04,138
Who is this other fucktard?

1133
01:27:07,988 --> 01:27:10,323
That's Bobby.

1134
01:27:10,324 --> 01:27:13,259
Bobby?

1135
01:27:13,260 --> 01:27:15,928
I'm not a fucktard.

1136
01:27:15,929 --> 01:27:18,298
I thought you were dead.

1137
01:27:18,299 --> 01:27:21,000
I think my ribs are broke.

1138
01:27:21,001 --> 01:27:24,537
And my arm, maybe.

1139
01:27:24,538 --> 01:27:26,239
Don't think I'm dead, though.

1140
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:29,809
Not yet, you're not.

1141
01:27:29,810 --> 01:27:33,413
Well, Sue, I suggest that you,
pick up your little friend

1142
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:39,952
here and the two you get the
fuck out of my cotton gin.

1143
01:27:39,953 --> 01:27:40,953
Now.

1144
01:27:46,093 --> 01:27:48,896
I'll be having a chat
with Old Giff here.

1145
01:27:52,266 --> 01:27:55,201
Just a word or two about
the whereabouts of my money,

1146
01:27:55,202 --> 01:27:58,071
would you say Giff?

1147
01:27:58,072 --> 01:28:00,506
Where's my money?

1148
01:28:00,507 --> 01:28:01,842
In my butt.

1149
01:28:05,145 --> 01:28:08,881
Hey, Big Red, did
I ever tell you

1150
01:28:08,882 --> 01:28:12,852
that that is the dumbest most
un-inspiring gangster name

1151
01:28:12,853 --> 01:28:15,955
I have ever heard in my life.

1152
01:28:15,956 --> 01:28:18,791
What did you do, drive
around in your big red car,

1153
01:28:18,792 --> 01:28:21,896
in your big truck
and say, I'm Big Red?

1154
01:28:28,035 --> 01:28:30,603
Is that one of the 32 ways?

1155
01:28:30,604 --> 01:28:32,705
What do you mean?

1156
01:28:32,706 --> 01:28:35,007
To tell a story.

1157
01:28:35,008 --> 01:28:37,810
You said there were 32 ways.

1158
01:28:37,811 --> 01:28:41,015
I didn't say that,
Jim Thomson did.
