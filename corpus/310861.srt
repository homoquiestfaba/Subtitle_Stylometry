1
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,356
-Anything I can do for you?
-Be happy.

2
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:11,902
Three out of four of the last presidents
have been governors...

3
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:16,374
which is why I think we should target
the money there rather.... Just a second.

4
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:19,241
Would you like me to take them?
You could have some time for yourself.

5
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:22,008
I can't think of anyone
I'd less like to spend time with.

6
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,243
-You sure?
-I'm positive. Thanks.

7
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:28,010
All right, well, be careful. Stick with Bella.

8
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:29,412
Bye.

9
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:33,117
Sorry. Target the money there
rather than on congressional races.

10
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:34,251
Yes.

11
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:56,370
Fatality.

12
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:15,754
Fatality.

13
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,290
Oh, my God.

14
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,627
Good morning.

15
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:56,533
Hey, I'm Olaf, Jeffrey's assistant.
Pleasure to meet you.

16
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,867
So, Robert, we are interested in your script.

17
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:37,674
-We're interested in The Dying Gaul.
-Okay.

18
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,404
So, that's that.

19
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,447
-Your agent is....
-Dead.

20
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:49,519
Yeah. Thanks.

21
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,923
Malcolm. Malcolm Cartonis.

22
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,453
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah.

23
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,021
Thank you.

24
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:02,329
-Who's taken over for him?
-Well, nobody.

25
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,030
Unfortunately,
he was kind of a one-man band.

26
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,066
Well, a good one obviously...

27
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,074
because I've read the script,
and Kohlberg's read it.

28
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,166
He has?

29
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,006
We don't green-light anything
without his approval.

30
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,170
Green-light?

31
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,339
No, I'm not saying we're making your script.

32
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:18,350
I'm saying we've all read it,
and we all think it's good.

33
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,646
And that's why I'm talking to you.

34
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,186
-Yes?
-Your wife.

35
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,413
Excuse me.

36
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,418
-Hey.
-Hi.

37
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:25,783
What's up?

38
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,290
Did we buy something
called Mortal Kombat?

39
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,589
Why? What is it?

40
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,187
It's this incredibly graphic,
violent video game...

41
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:36,099
with people's brains
blowing out of their head like tomato aspic.

42
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,500
Honey...

43
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,471
I've got somebody in the office.

44
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,901
-Oh, okay, sorry.
-Okay? We'll take care of it.

45
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:46,274
-Call me later.
-Okay.

46
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,246
-I love you.
-Love you, too.

47
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:51,249
So, where do you think you wanna go
with the script?

48
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:53,677
I'm sorry?

49
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,983
Where else do you wanna go
with the script?

50
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,389
Well, I thought I might take it
to some of the independents.

51
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:05,226
No, no. What a doll you are.

52
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,931
What kind of work do you wanna do on it?

53
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:11,135
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-That's okay.

54
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,195
That was just so sweet.

55
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:16,639
From acceptance to total rejection,
you took it all in stride.

56
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,943
What kinds of things
have you thought about or....

57
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:23,573
Well, it's as far as I could take it
without some kind of input from a director.

58
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:27,517
-And who's your dream director?
-Gus Van Sant, I guess...

59
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,418
-since Truffaut is dead.
-Good.

60
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:33,220
-Would you like me to show him the script?
-Yeah, sure. Why not?

61
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:36,159
That's good.
'Cause I already have and he likes it.

62
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,959
-I think I'm in the wrong office.
-He has some questions, as we all do.

63
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,524
And what's the title? Explain the title to me.

64
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,997
Well, you know, they go to that museum...

65
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,769
-Ken and Maurice.
-...in Rome...

66
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,742
-and they see the statue--
-Yeah.

67
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,109
But why is that the name of the movie?

68
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:56,809
-Hold on.
-Because--

69
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,111
Sorry.

70
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:01,884
Oh, I see.

71
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:04,923
I see. Because they feel that the sculpture...

72
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:08,119
in depicting the vanquished,
the dying soldier....

73
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:10,123
No, thank you.

74
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,289
-And the Gauls fought naked.
-Right.

75
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:15,061
-So, he's so young and defenseless...
-Beautiful.

76
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,500
...with just this little hole in his side.

77
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,903
And being that the statue
is by a Roman, by...

78
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,266
Wow.

79
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:28,011
...by someone from the side
responsible for the slaughter.

80
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,481
And they identify with the Gaul,
because they're gay...

81
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,143
and so many of their friends are dying...

82
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,517
and they're looking for
some kind of response from the enemy.

83
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,180
-Right.
-And remember that part...

84
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:39,451
when Maurice says...

85
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:42,824
"Maybe some kind of compassion
was awakened in the Romans...

86
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,362
"by seeing the sculpture?

87
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,729
"And at some future time,
as a result, maybe some other--"

88
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,791
-Gaul.
-Yes.

89
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,202
Will be spared.

90
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,530
It's kind of oblique.

91
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:59,238
No, I understand.
And it has a political overtone.

92
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,280
-That's right. Which I imagine--
-No, no.

93
00:08:01,347 --> 00:08:04,373
We're not afraid of that.
We're not afraid of anything.

94
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:07,584
The idea is to have the broadest appeal,
so that we can make money.

95
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,052
But also...

96
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,927
so that to whatever degree
the movie affects people...

97
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:20,659
it can also be kind of a dying Gaul
for the viewers.

98
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:24,835
I mean, if you even look at a movie like...

99
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,799
well, say, just to pick something, Tootsie...

100
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,941
which we didn't make,
but which is a very good movie.

101
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,637
-Yeah. It's a great comedy.
-Yeah.

102
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:37,978
It says something,
in a small but totally amusing way.

103
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,917
You don't see it coming.
This guy is an arrogant...

104
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,112
you know, chauvinist.

105
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,647
He, for his own reasons,
feels he has to dress up as a woman...

106
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:50,295
and as a result he learns something
about what it means to be a man.

107
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,264
-And you feel good for him.
-Yeah.

108
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:56,427
So that's the kind of political statement
you can slip an audience...

109
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:58,936
without their feeling they've been had.

110
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:01,334
All right.

111
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:07,103
Well, The Dying Gaul isn't a comedy,
it's a weepy.

112
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,444
And these movies are very...

113
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:13,978
hard...

114
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,348
to sell.

115
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,354
They're very hard.

116
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:29,726
And they're my favorite kind of movie.

117
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,565
They just need to be made with care.

118
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,539
Okay? So...

119
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:39,036
I understand your reasons
for wanting the men to be men...

120
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,442
because of the political dimension...

121
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,606
-but Ken and Maurice--
-I'm not making them heterosexual.

122
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:45,446
-No, no. Please.
-I'm sorry.

123
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,380
I'm not asking you
to jettison any of your principles.

124
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:49,478
Sorry.

125
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,583
I think I know what kind
of person you are, Robert.

126
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:58,255
-Sorry.
-I mean, I read your script.

127
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,365
You hungry?

128
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,466
Early money is like yeast.

129
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,208
In other words.... Oh, wait, hold on.

130
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,706
Hello?

131
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,840
Oh, hi. Thanks for getting back to me.

132
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:20,511
Listen, do you have any video games
for an 8-year-old...

133
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:22,850
that don't involve human slaughter?

134
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:27,453
The Silence of the Lambs is another one
that touches on feminist ideology without....

135
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:30,859
-Did you like that movie?
-Yes and no.

136
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,122
-Did you make it?
-No.

137
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:38,393
-No, no. Why didn't you like it?
-The faggy portrayal of the killer.

138
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,167
-He's not gay. Jame Gumb is not gay.
-Yeah, that's what I heard...

139
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,731
but I think that's a bunch of bullshit
because he has the poodle.

140
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,299
I had a poodle.

141
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,074
My wife and I had a poodle.

142
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,947
Okay, but I bet you didn't wear nipple rings
and put on eyeliner.

143
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:55,010
And you probably didn't cut up women
because you wanted to be one.

144
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:58,113
-You never know.
-True.

145
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,459
Hey, you wanna meet Tim Burton?

146
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,522
It's just something's not working.

147
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,961
-Let me check.
-ls that a new battery?

148
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:09,023
I see.

149
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,997
What about Nick Cage?

150
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,507
I mean, he's losing his hair.
What's that about?

151
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:21,068
-So, do you want to sell this script?
-Sure.

152
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:24,216
-And do you wanna do the rewrites?
-What do you mean?

153
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:27,682
I mean, are you interested
in doing the rewrites or...

154
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:31,183
-No.
-...do you wanna sell the script outright?

155
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:36,083
No, I don't want somebody else
mucking around with my script.

156
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:38,452
Good.

157
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:42,189
-Oh, hey, did you talk to your dad?
-Don't ask.

158
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:45,135
-Why? What did he say?
-My father tells me...

159
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,435
if I dare set foot back in Egypt,
he will have me beheaded.

160
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,201
As in....

161
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,881
-Look. voila.
-Oh, hey. Yeah.

162
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,616
Sorry you don't have an agent.

163
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,110
But let's....

164
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:03,844
What....

165
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:08,151
Presumably, you are...

166
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:14,088
Iooking for something universal
in the experience of two gay men...

167
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,997
-which a broader audience will identify with.
-You could say that.

168
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,798
Would that be a true statement?

169
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,099
Now, don't say anything until.... Okay?

170
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:31,583
Most Americans...

171
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,546
Let's hold all my calls, please, Liz.

172
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:39,887
...hate gay people.

173
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,187
They hear it's about gay people,
they won't go.

174
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,661
What about Philadelphia?

175
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,358
Philadelphia is a movie about a man
who hates gay people...

176
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,525
and it's been done.

177
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,762
To get people into the movie theaters...

178
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:53,202
they have to think it's gonna be fun...

179
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:55,466
or sensational, or some kind of....

180
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,908
Make them feel fantastic about themselves.

181
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:00,002
No one goes to the movies...

182
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,442
to have a bad time or to learn anything.

183
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:06,879
-Do we agree with this?
-Yes.

184
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:10,780
What is important
is what they leave the theater with.

185
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:15,020
And if they don't enter the theater...

186
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,889
they don't get a chance to leave it.

187
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,595
Is this acceptable to you as a thesis?

188
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,294
No?

189
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:31,474
No one is going to see The Dying Gaul.

190
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,643
If you could make it with Tom Cruise...

191
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:42,448
who wouldn't go near it for $100 million...

192
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,318
and get Spielberg to direct...

193
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,018
and release it on 400,000 screens...

194
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:49,287
no one is going to see...

195
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:51,992
The Dying Gaul.

196
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:57,300
Now...

197
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,366
if we make Maurice a woman with AlDS...

198
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,533
and, let's face it,
heterosexuals are getting AlDS...

199
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:06,772
-in disastrous numbers.... Robert.
-I want nothing to do with that.

200
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,220
We'll make our own version
of The Dying Gaul...

201
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:16,811
Ioosely based on your script.

202
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:17,913
Fine.

203
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,892
Or, or.... Wait. Robert!

204
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,391
Fuck.

205
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,249
You didn't let me finish.

206
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:49,344
Or we'll give you $1 million for your script...

207
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,422
with which you can go out
and write 400 new screenplays...

208
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:55,687
about gay men with AlDS, without...

209
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:56,921
whatever's the most important to you.

210
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,521
-lf you want the script so much--
-We think it is good, Robert...

211
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:00,826
and we will pay you for it.

212
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,926
We will not make The Dying Gaul
with two men in bed...

213
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:07,962
falling in love, surviving pain,
and all the blah, blah, blah.

214
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,167
It's not gonna happen, ever.

215
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:12,669
Ever.

216
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,005
Ever!

217
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,317
Where you going, Robert?

218
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:37,700
You have virtually no idea
what $1 million would mean to me in my life.

219
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,598
I'm still paying off my college loans.

220
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,800
I've written 15 spec scripts
which no one will buy.

221
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,605
I'm paying child support.

222
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:51,347
And Malcolm, who just died, my agent,
was also my lover.

223
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,483
I'm sorry.

224
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,915
So, I can't, in good conscience,
take this money from you.

225
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:05,588
You are an amazing
and lovely person, Robert...

226
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:09,125
and you have succeeded
in making me feel like a total scumbag.

227
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:12,036
Good. I'm glad.

228
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:15,164
-How's your health?
-I'm negative.

229
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:19,777
-Good.
-Maurice and l.... Malcolm.

230
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,481
God.

231
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,087
-Can't I write you another script?
-We want The Dying Gaul...

232
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,955
and we want you to write it.

233
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,122
Take the million.

234
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,021
Write something else.

235
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:28,038
-Hello?
-Hi.

236
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,618
I knew you'd be up.

237
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,680
Hi.

238
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:44,590
I made $1 million.

239
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:50,794
-How?
-I sold a script. Isn't that incredible?

240
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:55,269
After all this time,
I wanted to call you and Mark first.

241
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:58,734
I'm gonna put a third of it aside
for his college fund.

242
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,240
Is he awake?

243
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:11,448
Well...

244
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:16,352
-I'm happy for you, Robert.
-Wait. Don't go yet, Kelli.

245
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,865
You ragged on me 17 ways
when I didn't come to Malcolm's memorial.

246
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:24,127
-I'm sorry.
-You know I don't have money.

247
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:29,204
-That isn't why you didn't come.
-Well.

248
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:33,775
Well, okay.

249
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,111
I'd really....

250
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,415
It would mean a lot to me
to share this with my son.

251
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,450
It's 2:00 in the morning, honey.

252
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,083
Okay.

253
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,324
Well, I'll call some other time.

254
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:57,959
Okay. Bye-bye.

255
00:18:58,337 --> 00:18:59,702
I love you.

256
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:16,918
What?

257
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,749
We got it

258
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,726
Congratulations. May I read it?

259
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,391
Well, it's gonna change.

260
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:29,363
Before it does, may l?

261
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,932
-Please?
-Sure.

262
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,461
Hey. What's wrong?

263
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:43,727
Robert?

264
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:46,997
Tell me.

265
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,937
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

266
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,004
It's gonna be a beautiful movie.

267
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,576
And you are gonna write more movies.

268
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,812
And soon you're gonna be able
to write your own ticket.

269
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:04,745
I mean that, Robert.

270
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:08,724
Look at Spike Lee.
He writes movies he cares about...

271
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:13,293
about his own people,
and they make money.

272
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,767
I want that for you, Robert.

273
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:18,164
Give me a hug.

274
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:20,764
Come on.

275
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:24,941
Okay?

276
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,040
You are very handsome.

277
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:37,248
And I'm getting a little turned on.

278
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,316
Are you?

279
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,192
You can do anything you want,
as long as you don't call it what it is.

280
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:50,031
Understand?

281
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,538
Max, Debbon, I want you to meet someone.
Come on.

282
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:56,768
Hurry. Hurry.

283
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:01,605
What? Yes. That's why I'm not doing it.

284
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,308
Robert is a screenwriter
like Mommy used to be.

285
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,214
What a nice hat you have on.

286
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,346
She's going through a phase.

287
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,385
-Bath time.
-No!

288
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:14,084
-Did I ask your opinion? Go!
-No! No!

289
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,352
Everyday!

290
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:18,794
Hey, could you be louder?
Did you offer him something to drink?

291
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,255
Exactly.

292
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:23,529
-You have a child, Jeffrey says.
-Yeah. In New York.

293
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:27,664
-Do you miss it? Screenwriting?
-Oh, God, no.

294
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:31,669
I could only write the kinds of scripts
that Jeff would never make.

295
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,479
These agapanthus are beautiful.

296
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:35,774
-You know flowers?
-Elaine...

297
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:38,577
-offer him something.
-Can I offer you something to drink?

298
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:42,780
Well, I feel like I should say spring water,
but I'd really like a vodka.

299
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:47,157
-Peppered? Lemon? Ketel One?
-I'll drink them all and stay all night.

300
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,190
Just a plain.

301
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:52,361
But you should....

302
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,890
Some of these plants.

303
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:59,062
Okay. Yes. That's why I depend on you.

304
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,362
Some view, huh? Yes.

305
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,329
Okay.

306
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:06,469
There are days I wake up early....

307
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,146
Okay. God love you.

308
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:13,815
I'll look out and think,
"This is actually my home."

309
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,418
When is someone gonna march in here...

310
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,058
-and demand their keys back?
-Oh, God.

311
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:25,652
I wanna suck on you
till there isn't a drop left...

312
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,222
and lick you from head to toe
and have you inside....

313
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,198
Foreign markets and video.

314
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:33,931
You're gonna be able to have
a second house looking down on us.

315
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:36,496
Oh, everyone looks down on us.
That's nothing.

316
00:24:36,575 --> 00:24:38,668
-Cheers, Robert.
-Thanks.

317
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:40,040
What does that mean?

318
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:46,048
-I'll make a call, then we'll go.
-Okay.

319
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,920
What part of town do you live in, Robert?

320
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:02,398
Oh, God,
I live in West Hollywood in a rental.

321
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:03,695
Not for long.

322
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:08,772
-I don't wanna change anything, for now.
-Oh, you will. You will.

323
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,274
Elevator going up, up and up.

324
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:15,539
The context shifts. Things you thought
were luxuries become essential.

325
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:17,081
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

326
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:19,907
Suddenly your decisions are impelled...

327
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:24,046
by your desire
to own another Balthus, or Bacon.

328
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:26,215
This is the first money he's ever seen
in his life.

329
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:28,919
-He's not thinking about--
-No?

330
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,624
Decide for yourself.

331
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:34,888
Cheers.

332
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,599
Hello? Yeah.

333
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,606
No, fuck him. Fuck him!

334
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:48,639
No, tell him I said it.

335
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,943
I'm perfect.... Okay, this is my message...

336
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:53,484
"Fuck you, Scott."

337
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:57,545
Fuck. If he asks why I'm angry,
tell him I said, "Fuck you."

338
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:00,182
Okay? No, I'll put it on vibrate.

339
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:01,748
-Jeff.
-All right, all right.

340
00:26:01,826 --> 00:26:05,193
-I hate these test screenings.
-Why are you here, then?

341
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:09,723
I hear about a project for years, sometimes,
and I never meet the writers...

342
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:11,598
until we come to the mall.

343
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,662
I think they should spell it M-A-U-L.

344
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:17,440
Thanks, Danny.

345
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:19,676
I insisted on meeting you...

346
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,212
before I had to see you
completely crestfallen...

347
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:27,115
if your movie ever does get made.
Shaken, trembling, cast aside.

348
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:29,512
And Jeff made you sound like...

349
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,920
there was a glint of a human being
in there...

350
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,050
so I had to see for myself.

351
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:36,320
Hi.

352
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:38,692
He's gay!

353
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:45,026
Who's this mother fucker?

354
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:47,971
Keep your eyes on the road.

355
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,733
I can't stand it. Excuse me.

356
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:53,708
The road ahead of you instead.

357
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:57,708
Okay.

358
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,841
You suck on that, okay?

359
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:08,020
Robert, your script is so beautiful.

360
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:11,456
-Don't become one of them, all right?
-I won't.

361
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,809
-I'm sorry about your friend.
-So, what'd you guys think, huh?

362
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:34,011
-When did he die?
-January.

363
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:35,876
Of this year?

364
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:39,420
So, you're.... Oh, God.

365
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:41,717
Rough.

366
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:47,064
Sides of me, things I didn't even know
existed have sprung up and taken over.

367
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:50,292
-Such as?
-I'm, like, famished for distraction.

368
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:53,126
-Such as?
-I don't know.

369
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:57,499
I can sit for days on end, literally, though,
surfing the lnternet.

370
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,603
Do you do those chat rooms?

371
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:05,148
-What? He doesn't have to answer.
-I don't mind.

372
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:08,982
-I love them, actually.
-Here we go. Wish me luck.

373
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:15,616
They're like life after death, I think.

374
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:16,752
How so?

375
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:19,888
Well, there's no corporeal being.
There's just all these voices, you know?

376
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:22,831
Well, no, I haven't tried them, so....

377
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:24,195
Well...

378
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:28,394
you can make up anything
about yourself, right?

379
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:29,735
Right.

380
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:32,208
And do you know anything
about Buddhism?

381
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,568
A bit.

382
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,010
Buddhists believe in karma.

383
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,139
It's like the cumulative effect
of all our actions.

384
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,705
And that's what it's like...

385
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:42,810
just all this karma colliding
in the middle of nowhere.

386
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,784
What's your favorite really dirty chat room?

387
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,758
Well...

388
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:56,330
I like MenOnAParkBench, for one.

389
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,629
Park bench?

390
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:58,862
Yes!

391
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,501
To be continued.

392
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,766
Through the roof.

393
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,035
-Oh, that's great.
-lsn't that great?

394
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:05,633
Oh, I thought it was shit.

395
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:12,942
-That is the nicest person.
-lsn't he?

396
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:16,881
And the most fun I've had
with anybody in the industry in years.

397
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:17,944
Good.

398
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:21,185
-Hey, I'm in the industry.
-You are the industry.

399
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,251
You coming to bed?

400
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:29,890
I think I'm gonna just, you know,
check on some things.

401
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,369
Hi. You've reached Robert Sandrich.
Leave a message.

402
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:12,999
Listen, I hope that wasn't too weird tonight.

403
00:30:15,246 --> 00:30:18,773
She never goes to these things,
but she insisted on meeting you. So....

404
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,082
She's...

405
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:27,588
...incredibly smart and frustrated
and working on herself.

406
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:36,793
Just being with you
got me dripping tonight.

407
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:40,093
So sweet dreams.

408
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:43,269
Thanks again
for putting up with all the hoopla.

409
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:29,279
I don't think so.

410
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:41,730
Yes.

411
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,392
-Hello.
-Okay.

412
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,992
Good luck.

413
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,539
Watch, watch!

414
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:03,443
-You okay? Sorry.
-Excuse me.

415
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:13,783
Excuse me.

416
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,939
Look who emerged. How are you?

417
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:42,076
-Shrimp with saffron?
-Hey, look who's here.

418
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:43,211
Nothing. Thanks, anyway.

419
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:45,619
-Oh, hey.
-You a vegetarian?

420
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,783
-You're not a Buddhist or something?
-Yes, he is.

421
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,656
-Well....
-Yes.

422
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:51,718
-Here, that's got vegetables in it.
-Jeff.

423
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,889
-How's the revision going?
-It's going great.

424
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:57,059
-No?
-No.

425
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,329
-It's going great.
-It's not.

426
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,735
-Well, make him help.
-He's the one who wants you...

427
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:03,831
-to change your perfect script. Perfect.
-I've offered, believe me.

428
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:07,969
Storm his office and demand
he spend the entire day and....

429
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,445
-Hi, Elaine.
-Hey, Abe.

430
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,448
I need to find a great lawyer.

431
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:14,485
My 14-year-old
somehow managed to find a way...

432
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,077
to hack into
the Defense Department database.

433
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:19,850
Why don't you spend
just an hour or so at my office?

434
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:22,051
-Okay.
-Really?

435
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,787
That was.... You all right?

436
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,490
You sure?

437
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:29,192
Robert?

438
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:32,901
-Hi. You thought I was avoiding you, right?
-A little.

439
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:35,032
Are you all right?

440
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:45,239
-You should pull that out.
-This? Why?

441
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:46,783
I've been meaning to tell you.

442
00:34:46,851 --> 00:34:49,820
That right there is monkshood,
and over there.

443
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:51,811
The roots are dangerous.

444
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,982
-Really?
-Yes. Deadly.

445
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:55,889
I saw that. I saw that look.

446
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:00,822
You okay?

447
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:02,229
It was used...

448
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:06,929
to make spearhoods, spearheads,
and at executions...

449
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:09,063
-You sure you're all right?
-Yes.

450
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,802
...in primitive cultures.

451
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:13,901
It shuts down the entire
central nervous system completely.

452
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,003
You have to eat the roots, but still.

453
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,480
I don't think our children
will be eating roots.

454
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:22,178
-How do you know all this?
-Malcolm. He loved gardening.

455
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:26,517
I'm sorry.

456
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,722
He taught me stuff.

457
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:35,058
I think you should drink. Here.

458
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,861
Thank you.

459
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,805
I'm gonna stay up a bit.

460
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:51,914
-You wanna take a bath with me?
-I'm wired.

461
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:53,677
I need to pace, or something.

462
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:56,948
-You all right?
-Too much coffee.

463
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:00,017
-Okay.
-I'll be in.

464
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:16,895
Go away.

465
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:23,006
Anyone here ever lost a friend or lover?

466
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:29,937
I have.

467
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,515
It's only been a few weeks.

468
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:41,987
It gets worse.

469
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:46,826
Do you ever think of killing yourself?

470
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:51,558
All the time. See a shrink.

471
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,569
Oh, God.

472
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:04,337
-Got any recommendations?
-Yes, Marta Foss in Santa Monica.

473
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:06,280
-She's great.
-Do you see her?

474
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:10,585
Used to, for eons. My boyfriend did too.

475
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:15,548
-How did he die?
-TB of the brain.

476
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:21,428
They drilled holes into his skull
and injected the meds right into his brain...

477
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:25,060
an experiment that didn't work,
and put him through hell.

478
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:30,300
Did you help him die?

479
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:48,183
Damn it.

480
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,093
Hello?

481
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:02,164
Yes.

482
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,538
I'm sorry.

483
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:15,084
-I've never told anyone.
-Wow. How come?

484
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:18,280
Can't say.

485
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:26,661
Oh, God.

486
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:32,095
My grief has me thinking
I'm losing my mind.

487
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:34,535
-Is that natural?
-Yes.

488
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:36,704
What does one do?

489
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:40,300
Trawl these rooms
and sleep with all the wrong people.

490
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:44,906
Like me? You don't wanna fuck me?

491
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,011
I've already sort of got somebody.

492
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,446
Who?

493
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:54,952
-Oh, just some guy.
-Tell me.

494
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:58,190
-It isn't interesting.
-I'm interested.

495
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:10,835
Well, he's my boss on a project...

496
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:14,773
married, has two kids. I really like his wife.

497
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:32,919
See? Told you.

498
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:38,963
Sounds hot!

499
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:48,002
Well, you know how to reach me
if you change your mind.

500
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:53,072
Okay. See a shrink.

501
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:02,318
"Then, as Kabumpo
shook his head again"....

502
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:04,251
-Are you asleep?
-No.

503
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:13,455
Please, God, don't let me eat this child.

504
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,458
"Anxious.... Oh. Then as Kabumpo
shook his head again...

505
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,731
"the big boxer started off"....

506
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,771
Catch it. Catch it.

507
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:55,122
I'm sorry.

508
00:43:55,933 --> 00:44:00,131
Hey, hey. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

509
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,067
Baby. It's okay.

510
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,633
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

511
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:12,978
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

512
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,249
It's okay, baby. It's all right.

513
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,760
Don't be. Don't be sorry.

514
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:47,406
-You are so beautiful.
-No, I'm not.

515
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:51,377
I'll be the judge of that, thank you.

516
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:56,692
-You wouldn't like me if you really knew me.
-Yeah?

517
00:44:58,562 --> 00:45:00,393
Would you care to elaborate?

518
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:05,001
-No.
-Good.

519
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:23,216
-Hello?
-Yeah, we got it all.

520
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:24,345
-What?
-Everything.

521
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:29,624
There was this ant when I was meditating,
right after Malcolm's funeral.

522
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:32,958
It was a big red ant and it bit me.

523
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:36,292
And I couldn't kill it...

524
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:39,534
because I thought, "What if that's him?"

525
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:40,695
But...

526
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:42,797
now....

527
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:47,176
And what about what I flush
down the drain without even meaning to?

528
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,609
Spiders and...

529
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,513
stomping on them...

530
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,150
microbes.

531
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,187
Everything I feel...

532
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:06,052
or touch, is a potential slaughter.

533
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:13,130
You lived. He didn't.

534
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:19,539
That's all.

535
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:23,169
Are you seeing someone, Robert?

536
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:26,006
What do you mean?

537
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:28,746
A shrink?

538
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,316
Oh, no, I did. But not now.

539
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:35,256
Why did you stop?

540
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:40,856
I didn't want....

541
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:43,727
Thank you.

542
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:48,066
-I don't know.
-It's none of my business.

543
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,799
No, it's not that.

544
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:56,042
But are you?

545
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,207
-No.
-What?

546
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:03,344
Seeing someone.

547
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:34,141
You gotta use this.

548
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:37,383
You gotta promise to use this.

549
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:43,286
It's too fucking wacky.

550
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:46,888
Make something good of this. Promise me.

551
00:47:48,098 --> 00:47:49,395
I promise.

552
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:53,496
Traitor.

553
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:57,398
What?

554
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:23,926
Hi, DG.

555
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:26,460
Hi.

556
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:30,995
-Can I sit beside you?
-Sure.

557
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,870
Do you mind if we just talk?

558
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:37,106
No.

559
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,708
-How are you feeling?
-Okay.

560
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:42,441
-You sure?
-Yeah.

561
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,653
You seem sad.

562
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:48,254
Do I know you?

563
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:50,384
Yes.

564
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,855
Sorry, I don't remember our chatting.

565
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:01,734
Look at my name.

566
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:07,634
You're an angel?

567
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:09,805
Yes.

568
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:14,484
Does that mean you do nice things?
Is that what makes you an angel?

569
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:16,178
That's part of it.

570
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:20,051
Did you have a different name
when we talked?

571
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,112
Yes.

572
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,457
What was it?

573
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,793
If I tell you, you'll go away.

574
00:49:32,736 --> 00:49:35,705
Okay. So, did we have sex?

575
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:37,131
Yes.

576
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:39,198
-More than once?
-Yes.

577
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,744
-Really?
-Yes.

578
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:45,477
Tell me what I like.

579
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:51,216
You're extremely versatile.
You like kissing most of all.

580
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:52,652
Am I right?

581
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:56,520
Go on.

582
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,793
You prefer it first thing in the morning...

583
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,934
but nights are also good.

584
00:50:06,803 --> 00:50:09,294
Was I drunk? Did I tell you all this?

585
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:14,474
You like me to put a finger inside you
while I'm sucking you.

586
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,343
Tell me who this is.

587
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:22,494
No, I just wanted to say hi.

588
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,267
-Wait.
-Okay.

589
00:50:40,784 --> 00:50:42,274
Did I date you?

590
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:43,946
Yes.

591
00:50:44,087 --> 00:50:46,351
Wow. Male or female?

592
00:50:46,657 --> 00:50:47,817
Male.

593
00:50:48,826 --> 00:50:51,386
That narrows the field, a bit.

594
00:50:51,995 --> 00:50:53,860
You've had your share.

595
00:50:55,866 --> 00:50:58,164
How many men have I slept with?

596
00:50:59,203 --> 00:51:02,695
A dozen or so. No, 18 to be exact.

597
00:51:15,619 --> 00:51:18,213
-Who is this?
-Don't be afraid.

598
00:51:19,923 --> 00:51:21,322
Dr. Foss?

599
00:51:21,692 --> 00:51:24,217
She doesn't know
how many men you've slept with.

600
00:51:24,294 --> 00:51:25,352
Tony?

601
00:51:25,996 --> 00:51:29,193
-He doesn't even have a computer.
-How do you know that?

602
00:51:29,266 --> 00:51:31,393
From up here I can see a lot.

603
00:51:35,973 --> 00:51:39,431
It's difficult getting through.
It's taken me a long time.

604
00:51:39,509 --> 00:51:42,000
I want to know who the fuck this is.

605
00:51:42,479 --> 00:51:44,208
I love you, Robert.

606
00:51:44,681 --> 00:51:48,276
I'll always love you.
Don't worry about selling the script.

607
00:51:48,352 --> 00:51:49,546
Jeffrey?

608
00:51:50,153 --> 00:51:54,385
Jeffrey doesn't know what we did in bed.
He just wants to get fucked.

609
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,053
Please tell me who this is.

610
00:51:59,363 --> 00:52:02,196
-You know who I am.
-Who?

611
00:52:02,499 --> 00:52:06,959
I'm with you every night. When you close
your eyes, I curl up next to you.

612
00:52:07,704 --> 00:52:09,103
Say your name.

613
00:52:09,172 --> 00:52:13,404
I know I couldn't stand that closeness,
being against you as we slept.

614
00:52:14,244 --> 00:52:15,438
Malcolm?

615
00:52:15,812 --> 00:52:18,474
I sleep with you and walk with you.

616
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:24,350
Is this Malcolm? Stop this, whoever this is.

617
00:52:25,522 --> 00:52:28,491
-Sweet dreams, baby.
-God, please don't leave.

618
00:52:29,226 --> 00:52:32,525
I'll never leave you.
I'm with you through eternity.

619
00:52:33,797 --> 00:52:34,991
Malcolm?

620
00:52:37,668 --> 00:52:38,828
Malcolm?

621
00:52:39,202 --> 00:52:42,365
Yes, baby, yes.
I'm right here. And you're safe.

622
00:52:45,042 --> 00:52:49,001
Write me tomorrow, little Bubber.
You're my little Bubber, okay?

623
00:52:49,546 --> 00:52:52,481
Sweet dreams, baby. I'm....

624
00:52:54,051 --> 00:52:55,279
Bye.

625
00:53:16,974 --> 00:53:18,464
-Hello?
-Was that you?

626
00:53:18,542 --> 00:53:21,136
'Cause I swear to Christ, Jeff,
if that was you, I'll kill you.

627
00:53:21,211 --> 00:53:23,805
-What are you talking about?
-I mean that.

628
00:53:25,983 --> 00:53:27,075
Okay.

629
00:53:27,851 --> 00:53:30,149
I am fucked up enough to do it.

630
00:53:30,954 --> 00:53:32,478
What's wrong, Robert?

631
00:53:36,026 --> 00:53:38,460
-You swear that wasn't you?
-What?

632
00:53:40,197 --> 00:53:41,255
Okay.

633
00:53:44,401 --> 00:53:46,028
What's the matter?

634
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:48,001
Okay. Okay.

635
00:53:48,171 --> 00:53:51,004
-I'm sorry. Goodnight.
-Hey, wait.

636
00:53:56,246 --> 00:53:57,270
E?

637
00:54:01,985 --> 00:54:03,043
Hey.

638
00:54:03,987 --> 00:54:05,955
-Oh, sorry.
-Come to bed.

639
00:54:21,605 --> 00:54:25,871
I wonder why Robert
never talks about his wife and son.

640
00:54:26,343 --> 00:54:31,246
I wouldn't be able to stop thinking
about you if something happened to us.

641
00:54:33,784 --> 00:54:35,342
Do you think....

642
00:54:36,553 --> 00:54:39,317
Do you think it has something to do
with Malcolm?

643
00:54:39,389 --> 00:54:42,825
-Maybe.
-I just worry. So much to deal with.

644
00:54:53,603 --> 00:54:55,594
-Dr. Foss?
-Robert.

645
00:54:56,706 --> 00:54:58,537
What's wrong? Come in.

646
00:55:03,747 --> 00:55:07,114
-Sorry to bother you.
-It's all right. Come, sit.

647
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:11,150
-I just have to ask you a question, that's all.
-All right.

648
00:55:14,891 --> 00:55:16,586
Are you ArckAngell?

649
00:55:18,195 --> 00:55:20,095
I'm not sure....

650
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:22,357
Are you? Just say yes or no.

651
00:55:22,766 --> 00:55:26,361
-I don't know what you mean. ArckAngell?
-Are you ArckAngell?

652
00:55:26,803 --> 00:55:30,364
-'Cause if you are....
-Robert, have you taken something?

653
00:55:33,009 --> 00:55:37,036
-Never mind. I'm just really sorry.
-No. I haven't heard from you in months.

654
00:55:37,114 --> 00:55:39,605
Something is obviously distressing you.

655
00:55:39,683 --> 00:55:43,744
Just forget all of this.
It was good to see you.

656
00:55:44,921 --> 00:55:47,719
I'd like you to come and see me,
today, if possible.

657
00:55:47,791 --> 00:55:49,520
We'll see. Thank you.

658
00:55:51,061 --> 00:55:54,462
I expect to hear from you, Robert.

659
00:55:54,698 --> 00:55:55,960
All right?

660
00:56:41,411 --> 00:56:43,379
Hello. You got my e-mail?

661
00:56:44,881 --> 00:56:46,109
Just now.

662
00:56:48,585 --> 00:56:51,520
-Do you remember the principles?
-Of course.

663
00:56:54,291 --> 00:56:56,350
I can't stay long this time.

664
00:57:03,233 --> 00:57:05,497
I need assurances this is you.

665
00:57:09,139 --> 00:57:13,371
I taught you to dig bottoms.
You were once a bottom. My dog bottom.

666
00:57:13,643 --> 00:57:17,773
Then we found out I was positive
and I couldn't risk infecting you.

667
00:57:18,882 --> 00:57:20,144
What else?

668
00:57:24,754 --> 00:57:29,157
Remember the time right after I died,
you were meditating and there was an ant?

669
00:57:29,226 --> 00:57:31,888
You remember the time I'm talking about?

670
00:57:37,267 --> 00:57:38,427
Maybe.

671
00:57:39,502 --> 00:57:42,062
It might be me, you thought, reborn.

672
00:57:42,472 --> 00:57:45,964
You thought if it was born
the instant I left my body....

673
00:57:46,042 --> 00:57:49,375
But life is like a current.
It flows through the ant...

674
00:57:49,446 --> 00:57:51,209
and you and me.

675
00:57:52,015 --> 00:57:53,380
Indivisible.

676
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:55,049
Look within.

677
00:57:55,685 --> 00:57:57,346
More, I need more.

678
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:02,055
I fight to get through.

679
00:58:04,227 --> 00:58:06,422
What is it like where you are?

680
00:58:08,832 --> 00:58:10,026
Jeff!

681
00:58:11,401 --> 00:58:12,766
Everything is wet now.

682
00:58:17,007 --> 00:58:18,031
Hello?

683
00:58:18,108 --> 00:58:22,101
I can see from here
that you will survive and go on to flourish.

684
00:58:23,079 --> 00:58:24,876
-Hey.
-Hi.

685
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:29,685
-Is Jeffrey there?
-Hold on a sec.

686
00:58:35,425 --> 00:58:37,017
Where did you go?

687
00:58:37,093 --> 00:58:39,653
Jeff! Phone!

688
00:58:39,796 --> 00:58:42,822
-Can you take a message?
-I'm on the toilet!

689
00:58:50,573 --> 00:58:52,040
-Hello?
-Hi, it's me.

690
00:58:52,108 --> 00:58:55,134
Robert? Hello?

691
00:58:55,745 --> 00:58:58,213
-You all right?
-Yeah. I'm here....

692
00:58:59,282 --> 00:59:00,806
I hear clicking.

693
00:59:02,285 --> 00:59:03,809
I'm still here.

694
00:59:04,154 --> 00:59:05,746
I'm typing up some....

695
00:59:05,822 --> 00:59:07,414
I'm not Jeffrey.

696
00:59:08,992 --> 00:59:12,655
You keep testing me.
I'm not Jeffrey. I'm not Foss.

697
00:59:14,831 --> 00:59:16,162
You through?

698
00:59:16,966 --> 00:59:19,434
So, what was that about last night?

699
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:22,601
Jeffrey obviously isn't clever enough...

700
00:59:22,672 --> 00:59:26,608
to talk on the phone with you
and send you IMs at the same time.

701
00:59:27,577 --> 00:59:28,703
Just....

702
00:59:28,778 --> 00:59:30,109
Just what?

703
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:33,206
Sorry, I had some thoughts
about the script...

704
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:35,750
-and I wondered if I could see you.
-Today?

705
00:59:35,819 --> 00:59:38,913
-Well, yeah, that would....
-Are you still there?

706
00:59:40,924 --> 00:59:42,016
Yes.

707
00:59:42,092 --> 00:59:44,219
-That would....
-Yeah, today.

708
00:59:44,627 --> 00:59:48,324
-You sound really distracted, my friend.
-I am. Let me call you back.

709
00:59:48,398 --> 00:59:50,559
Or what time could we....

710
00:59:50,633 --> 00:59:52,396
Why don't we meet at my office
around 3:00?

711
00:59:52,469 --> 00:59:55,802
-Do you remember The Middle Way?
-When? I'm sorry.

712
00:59:55,872 --> 00:59:57,669
3:00. At my office.

713
00:59:57,741 --> 01:00:01,541
-Robert, I'm not Jeffrey.
-Wait.

714
01:00:02,846 --> 01:00:05,110
Okay, that's great. Is Elaine there?

715
01:00:05,181 --> 01:00:06,842
I have to leave now.

716
01:00:06,916 --> 01:00:09,180
Elaine? She's in the bathroom.

717
01:00:09,386 --> 01:00:11,081
No, I'm all yours.

718
01:00:11,554 --> 01:00:13,044
Are you sure?

719
01:00:13,123 --> 01:00:14,613
All mine what?

720
01:00:15,925 --> 01:00:17,358
Am I sure? Yes.

721
01:00:17,427 --> 01:00:19,759
-Are you sure you're all right?
-Now.

722
01:00:19,829 --> 01:00:21,922
-Yes, sorry.
-Meaning?

723
01:00:24,367 --> 01:00:26,232
Okay. Bye.

724
01:00:27,337 --> 01:00:28,702
Robert?

725
01:00:28,772 --> 01:00:31,707
-Really, I am. I'll see you.
-I'm all yours now.

726
01:00:31,775 --> 01:00:33,709
I'm sorry. Bye.

727
01:00:34,377 --> 01:00:35,503
Okay.

728
01:00:35,612 --> 01:00:38,513
I can only prove myself to you this one time.

729
01:00:39,349 --> 01:00:41,681
If you don't believe, I'm gone.

730
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:44,812
Okay.

731
01:00:55,832 --> 01:00:58,801
I'll tell you something Jeffrey doesn't know.

732
01:01:05,208 --> 01:01:06,937
Kelli is my sister.

733
01:01:07,977 --> 01:01:10,207
You left her and Mark for me.

734
01:01:12,982 --> 01:01:15,815
I'll tell you something Foss doesn't know.

735
01:01:20,824 --> 01:01:22,758
You've been drinking again...

736
01:01:22,826 --> 01:01:25,989
and you've stopped meditating
and going to the gym.

737
01:01:26,062 --> 01:01:28,963
-What you doing?
-Honey, I'm working.

738
01:01:29,032 --> 01:01:32,092
-Please don't distract me, okay?
-Sorry.

739
01:01:45,215 --> 01:01:47,513
Here is something no one knows.

740
01:01:55,325 --> 01:01:56,815
You killed me.

741
01:01:59,829 --> 01:02:03,265
You stopped my heart
when I might have gone on living.

742
01:02:03,366 --> 01:02:05,334
You couldn't stand to see me suffer.

743
01:02:05,401 --> 01:02:10,134
You stole potassium chloride from
the nurse's cart and injected it into my Iv.

744
01:02:15,445 --> 01:02:16,844
I can't stay.

745
01:02:26,623 --> 01:02:27,749
Wait!

746
01:02:37,767 --> 01:02:41,430
What's with the fucking phone calls?
Are you out of your mind, huh?

747
01:02:45,909 --> 01:02:48,241
-I thought somebody was fucking with me.
-Who?

748
01:02:48,311 --> 01:02:51,075
-I don't wanna talk about it.
-How come?

749
01:02:51,247 --> 01:02:53,442
Because it's resolved itself.

750
01:02:55,118 --> 01:02:57,143
And I can't know about it?

751
01:02:59,556 --> 01:03:01,854
You don't like secrets, do you?

752
01:03:01,991 --> 01:03:03,583
No, I just, l....

753
01:03:04,527 --> 01:03:06,085
I care about you.

754
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:08,422
No.

755
01:03:09,098 --> 01:03:11,396
No. You just want a good script.

756
01:03:11,467 --> 01:03:13,901
Once we go into production,
you're gonna dump me like that.

757
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:16,404
-ls that what you think?
-I don't know.

758
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:20,000
I can't tell anything about anything.

759
01:03:37,627 --> 01:03:40,687
Malcolm, if this is you...

760
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:45,700
I know you think I've betrayed you,
sleeping with this man.

761
01:03:47,637 --> 01:03:49,264
I feel so lost.

762
01:03:50,306 --> 01:03:52,035
I don't love him...

763
01:03:52,108 --> 01:03:55,271
or want to hurt his marriage.
His wife is about...

764
01:03:55,345 --> 01:03:58,678
the only kind, loving person I know.

765
01:04:01,017 --> 01:04:03,918
I don't want to do anything to anger him...

766
01:04:04,253 --> 01:04:06,983
because he holds my future in his hands.

767
01:04:12,962 --> 01:04:15,829
I think he's just using me for sensation...

768
01:04:18,234 --> 01:04:20,964
because his marriage has gotten routine.

769
01:04:22,939 --> 01:04:24,907
I don't think we'll last.

770
01:04:26,576 --> 01:04:30,068
I need you to forgive me.

771
01:04:32,382 --> 01:04:35,545
I'll end it as soon as I've finished the script.

772
01:04:36,686 --> 01:04:38,313
I know you must...

773
01:04:39,622 --> 01:04:42,182
judge me for changing the screenplay.

774
01:04:44,594 --> 01:04:46,960
And I don't know how you feel...

775
01:04:47,997 --> 01:04:49,191
about...

776
01:04:51,968 --> 01:04:54,801
what happened our last day...

777
01:04:58,441 --> 01:05:00,068
at the hospital.

778
01:05:01,511 --> 01:05:03,479
You were in such pain...

779
01:05:03,579 --> 01:05:05,410
and the doctors said...

780
01:05:05,782 --> 01:05:07,807
that you would never recover.

781
01:05:08,818 --> 01:05:12,652
That's what they were saying, isn't it?

782
01:05:14,057 --> 01:05:15,957
I'm afraid I've lost your love...

783
01:05:16,025 --> 01:05:20,962
and your pain hurts me more
than mine could ever. Please, Malcolm....

784
01:05:21,864 --> 01:05:25,265
Please, God, let this be real,
let this really be you.

785
01:05:25,868 --> 01:05:28,632
I love you more than I love my own life.

786
01:05:28,738 --> 01:05:31,536
I want to be with you through eternity.

787
01:05:32,041 --> 01:05:33,167
Now.

788
01:05:33,443 --> 01:05:36,674
I can't bear this,
the pain of being without you.

789
01:05:36,746 --> 01:05:39,078
You are my body and my heart...

790
01:05:39,348 --> 01:05:42,806
and anything that is decent
and worthwhile in me.

791
01:05:42,919 --> 01:05:44,546
And you are gone.

792
01:05:45,021 --> 01:05:46,750
I want to be melded.

793
01:05:47,657 --> 01:05:50,217
If you tell me to kill myself, I will.

794
01:05:50,293 --> 01:05:53,057
Please, tell me what to do. Oh, please.

795
01:06:05,975 --> 01:06:07,636
Do you love Elaine?

796
01:06:09,178 --> 01:06:10,304
Yes.

797
01:06:12,181 --> 01:06:15,241
I did once, very much. I really did.

798
01:06:18,187 --> 01:06:19,415
And now?

799
01:06:20,156 --> 01:06:21,248
Yes.

800
01:06:22,658 --> 01:06:23,886
If, but....

801
01:06:25,595 --> 01:06:27,995
If I could have seen the future...

802
01:06:29,465 --> 01:06:30,693
maybe....

803
01:06:33,870 --> 01:06:37,271
Sometimes I think, if it weren't
for Max and Debbon, you know....

804
01:06:40,376 --> 01:06:42,037
You'd divorce her?

805
01:06:42,378 --> 01:06:43,470
Yes.

806
01:06:44,413 --> 01:06:45,505
Or....

807
01:06:47,483 --> 01:06:50,247
Did you ever see
Crimes and Misdemeanors?

808
01:06:52,221 --> 01:06:53,688
What? You'd kill her?

809
01:06:54,323 --> 01:06:55,415
No.

810
01:06:57,293 --> 01:07:00,729
-Stop--
-No. No, not really, not....

811
01:07:01,664 --> 01:07:03,427
It's just a fantasy.

812
01:07:10,506 --> 01:07:12,770
What? You never fantasize?

813
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:16,478
Mr. Moral, you never fantasize
about Malcolm?

814
01:07:16,546 --> 01:07:18,810
You never saw him suffering...

815
01:07:20,049 --> 01:07:23,985
and thought, "Christ,
I wish I could put him out of his misery?"

816
01:07:30,026 --> 01:07:32,756
No. I never wanted to see him die, ever.

817
01:07:36,399 --> 01:07:38,458
-Okay, I'm a jerk.
-Ever.

818
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:08,922
Dearest Bubber...

819
01:08:09,632 --> 01:08:12,465
you did exactly as I hoped you would do...

820
01:08:12,535 --> 01:08:16,096
and you have never done anything
short of the miraculous.

821
01:08:18,774 --> 01:08:21,242
No one could have loved me as you did...

822
01:08:21,310 --> 01:08:23,938
and you must go on living and writing.

823
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:26,543
The movie is a good thing...

824
01:08:26,616 --> 01:08:29,107
and the money is, too,
if you use it for good.

825
01:08:30,019 --> 01:08:33,011
I may not be able
to keep doing this for long.

826
01:08:33,556 --> 01:08:37,287
I will watch over you,
and you will never put a foot wrong.

827
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:39,955
I will protect you. I promise.

828
01:08:41,097 --> 01:08:42,587
Trust yourself.

829
01:08:44,133 --> 01:08:48,797
Kelli will forgive you, and you and she
and Mark, will grow close again.

830
01:08:49,071 --> 01:08:53,405
And you will have a long lifetime
of love and challenging work.

831
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:56,178
You deserve these things.

832
01:08:58,581 --> 01:09:01,141
I will try to reach you when I can...

833
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:03,750
but you must know
that I am always with you...

834
01:09:03,819 --> 01:09:06,811
always loving you, always saying yes.

835
01:09:08,157 --> 01:09:11,354
Yes, for all of eternity, Robert.

836
01:09:12,094 --> 01:09:16,087
And you must never doubt that,
never doubt my devotion to you...

837
01:09:16,299 --> 01:09:17,960
and my gratitude.

838
01:09:19,568 --> 01:09:23,299
Don't press your luck
or Robert will grow tired...

839
01:09:23,572 --> 01:09:27,099
and want to break your spirit
as much as the rest of us.

840
01:09:29,078 --> 01:09:31,012
I will hear you always.

841
01:09:31,547 --> 01:09:33,811
So please be good to yourself.

842
01:09:34,417 --> 01:09:37,284
Remember, suffering is a disease...

843
01:09:37,486 --> 01:09:40,387
from which everyone may be truly cured.

844
01:09:40,957 --> 01:09:43,653
Look within: thou art Buddha.

845
01:09:46,796 --> 01:09:48,127
I love you.

846
01:09:51,901 --> 01:09:53,425
I love you, too.

847
01:09:55,137 --> 01:09:57,469
-You're so good.
-Oh, right.

848
01:09:57,540 --> 01:09:58,973
No, you are.

849
01:10:00,142 --> 01:10:03,270
I think I see parts of you
that no one else does.

850
01:10:06,248 --> 01:10:10,116
And you don't know
how much goodness there is in there...

851
01:10:10,186 --> 01:10:13,383
just waiting to stir up a storm.

852
01:11:06,475 --> 01:11:08,739
It's time for you to start letting me go now.

853
01:11:08,811 --> 01:11:09,869
No.

854
01:11:09,945 --> 01:11:11,071
Yes, it is.

855
01:11:11,414 --> 01:11:13,507
-Wait, what do I do?
-About?

856
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:16,281
Everything. Jeffrey?

857
01:11:16,352 --> 01:11:18,445
Your love is like a beacon.

858
01:11:18,854 --> 01:11:22,881
Anyone who crosses its path
will shine and be dazed.

859
01:11:23,726 --> 01:11:26,320
Let him play, but be careful.

860
01:11:26,629 --> 01:11:28,790
Is he falling in love with me?

861
01:11:28,898 --> 01:11:32,129
Self-salvation is for any man
the immediate task.

862
01:11:32,835 --> 01:11:34,530
You don't like him.

863
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:37,464
I will not pass judgment on this man.

864
01:11:38,474 --> 01:11:40,999
I don't want to be responsible
for hurting anyone.

865
01:11:41,077 --> 01:11:42,977
It isn't in your nature.

866
01:11:43,879 --> 01:11:45,744
I want it to end gently.

867
01:11:46,649 --> 01:11:49,482
You don't think he'd actually leave Elaine?

868
01:11:49,585 --> 01:11:52,053
Only he knows what's in his heart.

869
01:11:52,388 --> 01:11:54,356
What do you think, though?

870
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:58,223
I suspect he said that
to make you feel better.

871
01:11:58,961 --> 01:12:00,394
Look within.

872
01:12:00,796 --> 01:12:02,195
Sometimes...

873
01:12:02,932 --> 01:12:05,366
I don't know, it's almost like...

874
01:12:05,501 --> 01:12:08,265
he enjoys making Elaine look ridiculous.

875
01:12:08,337 --> 01:12:12,797
Putting his dick in my hand
when she's in the house. Stuff like that.

876
01:12:15,811 --> 01:12:17,938
And I don't want to wreck their marriage.

877
01:12:19,148 --> 01:12:20,581
You couldn't.

878
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:23,074
You don't have that power.

879
01:12:23,986 --> 01:12:26,216
I can't believe he talked about killing her.

880
01:12:26,889 --> 01:12:29,449
You don't think he'd actually do it, do you?

881
01:12:33,729 --> 01:12:36,323
Anything special you want today,
Miss Tishop?

882
01:12:36,398 --> 01:12:38,696
-No, thank you.
-Okay, very well.

883
01:12:48,043 --> 01:12:49,476
Are you there?

884
01:12:57,887 --> 01:12:58,945
Yes.

885
01:12:59,989 --> 01:13:01,957
He would, or you're there?

886
01:13:02,825 --> 01:13:06,124
Emad, I don't want you to clean today.
Come tomorrow.

887
01:13:06,996 --> 01:13:10,227
I need to concentrate on my work
and be alone.

888
01:13:10,299 --> 01:13:11,823
Okay, very well.

889
01:13:15,070 --> 01:13:16,230
Okay....

890
01:13:22,178 --> 01:13:25,409
Only he knows what's in his heart.

891
01:13:30,619 --> 01:13:34,180
He's so used to lying to get what he wants,
and he has...

892
01:13:34,623 --> 01:13:37,751
so much money,
he could probably get away with it.

893
01:13:39,195 --> 01:13:43,495
He seemed so guilty and ashamed
when he said it.

894
01:13:50,806 --> 01:13:53,274
You will have many loves...

895
01:13:54,076 --> 01:13:56,670
but I will have only one for all time.

896
01:13:56,745 --> 01:13:59,612
Forgive.... Forgive yourself.

897
01:14:02,318 --> 01:14:03,683
I feel you.

898
01:14:04,553 --> 01:14:05,884
There's....

899
01:14:06,555 --> 01:14:08,284
There's a disturbance.

900
01:14:21,036 --> 01:14:22,469
Hi, you've reached Bella.

901
01:14:22,538 --> 01:14:25,974
I'm either on the phone or out of range.
Leave a message.

902
01:14:27,109 --> 01:14:29,407
Call me right away. It's urgent.

903
01:14:32,514 --> 01:14:33,606
Hello?

904
01:14:39,588 --> 01:14:40,885
-Hey.
-Hey.

905
01:14:42,391 --> 01:14:43,449
What?

906
01:14:43,525 --> 01:14:45,049
We have to talk.

907
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:46,184
Okay.

908
01:14:46,829 --> 01:14:48,524
Something.... Now?

909
01:14:49,265 --> 01:14:52,200
Robert's gonna come by to work in a bit,
15 minutes or so.

910
01:14:52,268 --> 01:14:54,327
I need a little time alone.

911
01:14:55,671 --> 01:14:57,866
-What's wrong?
-And then I need...

912
01:14:57,940 --> 01:15:00,738
-some time alone with you.
-Okay.

913
01:15:00,976 --> 01:15:03,206
Robert's not coming for the meeting.

914
01:15:03,279 --> 01:15:05,372
-He's not? He called?
-I know.

915
01:15:06,348 --> 01:15:08,111
-You know?
-Please...

916
01:15:08,450 --> 01:15:11,180
don't insult me. It would be very bad
if you did anything now...

917
01:15:11,253 --> 01:15:15,952
to try to convince me
that it isn't or hasn't happened.

918
01:15:16,025 --> 01:15:18,550
-What has?
-Because then I would know you...

919
01:15:18,627 --> 01:15:20,720
to be a liar and I have...

920
01:15:20,929 --> 01:15:25,628
concrete proof of what has taken place,
is continuing.

921
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:29,935
I don't....

922
01:15:30,973 --> 01:15:34,602
Already you're fouling the water
of what could only...

923
01:15:34,677 --> 01:15:38,169
possibly be some kind of peace between us.

924
01:15:38,814 --> 01:15:39,940
But...

925
01:15:40,316 --> 01:15:42,477
you can't say another word...

926
01:15:43,218 --> 01:15:46,085
or lie to me or I will leave you for good.

927
01:15:49,591 --> 01:15:50,888
Thank you.

928
01:15:52,227 --> 01:15:56,561
I need a little time to get over the fact
of what he showed me.... Facts.

929
01:15:57,199 --> 01:16:01,602
Don't make me elaborate
about this right now, please, Jeffrey.

930
01:16:03,205 --> 01:16:04,297
All right.

931
01:16:04,373 --> 01:16:08,605
I'm asking you
to give me some time here by myself...

932
01:16:08,677 --> 01:16:12,238
and then the two of us
can sit down together...

933
01:16:12,314 --> 01:16:15,078
and work out
what we're going to have or not.

934
01:16:15,150 --> 01:16:18,984
Look, I promise,
I swear, I won't see him anymore.

935
01:16:19,688 --> 01:16:23,647
I'll give the movie to somebody else.
I'll fire him.

936
01:16:26,195 --> 01:16:29,358
-That would be a start, but--
-Can you tell me what he said?

937
01:16:29,431 --> 01:16:32,559
If you insist on grilling me,
then we can have it out now...

938
01:16:32,634 --> 01:16:35,797
but I can't guarantee
what conclusions I'll reach.

939
01:16:35,871 --> 01:16:37,202
All right, okay.

940
01:16:37,272 --> 01:16:41,231
Go away. Come back at 6:30.

941
01:16:43,312 --> 01:16:44,745
I'll kill him.

942
01:16:54,189 --> 01:16:56,555
I would never hurt you on purpose.

943
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:07,398
Should I pick up the kids or....

944
01:17:10,806 --> 01:17:12,535
They're at Shoshi's.

945
01:17:13,709 --> 01:17:16,041
She's taking them for the night.

946
01:17:16,378 --> 01:17:17,777
You sure?

947
01:17:19,448 --> 01:17:21,143
I want to be alone with you.

948
01:17:26,588 --> 01:17:28,055
I love you, E.

949
01:17:31,727 --> 01:17:33,786
That's all I'm going to say.

950
01:17:57,553 --> 01:17:59,885
-Hello?
-Oh, God. Where are you?

951
01:18:00,422 --> 01:18:02,947
About eight minutes from home.
Did you call before?

952
01:18:03,025 --> 01:18:06,256
If you see Jeffrey, don't stop to talk to him.

953
01:18:06,528 --> 01:18:08,996
Turn off on a side street right now.

954
01:18:09,364 --> 01:18:11,696
Don't let him see you if you can help it.

955
01:18:11,767 --> 01:18:15,328
But if he does for some reason, don't stop.

956
01:18:15,637 --> 01:18:17,400
-Call me back, all right?
-Hello?

957
01:18:17,473 --> 01:18:19,708
-Oh, I have to go.
-Jeffrey?

958
01:18:21,243 --> 01:18:22,938
Hello? Jeffrey?

959
01:18:26,348 --> 01:18:30,011
-The door was unlocked.
-He had to cancel your appointment.

960
01:18:31,987 --> 01:18:35,855
He said he couldn't get back here
until 6:30, at the earliest.

961
01:18:36,124 --> 01:18:37,352
Oh, well.

962
01:18:41,163 --> 01:18:42,494
Excuse me.

963
01:18:53,675 --> 01:18:55,973
-Have him, Robert.
-What?

964
01:18:56,879 --> 01:19:00,144
Have him. Please. Take him.

965
01:19:01,016 --> 01:19:04,417
It will help my suit
if you're both more open about it.

966
01:19:08,457 --> 01:19:11,187
Is there anything you want to say to me?

967
01:19:22,070 --> 01:19:25,870
Robert, what is unconditional love like?

968
01:19:26,642 --> 01:19:28,200
Can you tell me?

969
01:19:29,645 --> 01:19:31,135
How do you....

970
01:19:34,016 --> 01:19:36,507
Where do you find it in yourself...

971
01:19:37,653 --> 01:19:40,952
to give, much less get?

972
01:19:41,790 --> 01:19:44,258
I'm not even thinking about that.
That would be...

973
01:19:44,326 --> 01:19:46,351
too terrible to contemplate.

974
01:19:47,796 --> 01:19:49,195
Sit, please.

975
01:19:55,203 --> 01:19:56,864
You and Malcolm...

976
01:19:59,274 --> 01:20:01,708
where did you find it in yourself?

977
01:20:08,483 --> 01:20:12,817
How did you manage to put up with all the,
literally, the shit?

978
01:20:15,223 --> 01:20:16,588
So much compromise.

979
01:20:19,795 --> 01:20:21,558
I never lied to him.

980
01:20:22,331 --> 01:20:24,231
Or accepted one from him.

981
01:20:24,299 --> 01:20:26,631
We simply said, "No more lies."

982
01:20:28,303 --> 01:20:31,670
If you had to venture a guess,
in order to help me...

983
01:20:32,307 --> 01:20:33,865
you would say...

984
01:20:34,977 --> 01:20:37,411
I failed to see. I did....

985
01:20:37,479 --> 01:20:39,947
I did what, from your perspective?

986
01:20:44,486 --> 01:20:46,044
I would say....

987
01:20:46,722 --> 01:20:48,383
I would say...

988
01:20:50,525 --> 01:20:54,791
that you are responsible for all of it.

989
01:20:55,364 --> 01:21:00,131
All the things that make us feel like victims,
it's a lesson.

990
01:21:01,470 --> 01:21:04,098
Look within. No one is ever a victim.

991
01:21:07,209 --> 01:21:09,200
Look for what is positive.

992
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:13,345
Well, good.

993
01:21:15,384 --> 01:21:19,013
I'll look for the positive
in you fucking Jeffrey...

994
01:21:19,087 --> 01:21:22,420
behind my back over and over again.

995
01:21:22,491 --> 01:21:25,983
And all the while....
No, you will not walk out of here.

996
01:21:26,061 --> 01:21:29,497
All the while,
I'm trying to be generous to you.

997
01:21:33,001 --> 01:21:34,969
Don't do me any favors.

998
01:21:35,604 --> 01:21:38,767
Self-salvation is for any man
the immediate task.

999
01:21:53,555 --> 01:21:55,489
Please tell Jeffrey I'd stopped by.

1000
01:21:57,192 --> 01:21:58,887
ArckAngell is dead, Robert.

1001
01:22:04,066 --> 01:22:05,192
What?

1002
01:22:05,967 --> 01:22:07,457
He had to be...

1003
01:22:07,903 --> 01:22:09,495
deleted from his hard drive.

1004
01:22:09,571 --> 01:22:12,938
He doesn't even have a floppy anymore.

1005
01:22:14,242 --> 01:22:15,334
Nothing.

1006
01:22:17,846 --> 01:22:20,371
Self-salvation for all of us. Thanks.

1007
01:22:20,582 --> 01:22:21,708
How?

1008
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:27,845
The nice thing is, you will never know.

1009
01:22:28,657 --> 01:22:32,684
Thieves and hackers,
unlike screenwriters, feel no need...

1010
01:22:32,761 --> 01:22:35,525
to leave their name emblazoned
all over their work.

1011
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:40,070
I'm very sorry.

1012
01:25:48,023 --> 01:25:49,149
Forgive me?

1013
01:26:09,778 --> 01:26:11,109
-Hey.
-Hello.

1014
01:26:17,218 --> 01:26:18,310
Hey.

1015
01:26:18,586 --> 01:26:20,884
Here's Pinky. Pinky.

1016
01:26:22,023 --> 01:26:23,490
And your backpack.

1017
01:26:23,558 --> 01:26:27,050
You know what?
We're going to go visit Aunt Catherine.

1018
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:35,264
Yay! Oh, let me drive.

1019
01:28:20,075 --> 01:28:21,702
Robert, open up.

1020
01:28:23,244 --> 01:28:25,075
Robert, I need to talk to you.

1021
01:28:25,346 --> 01:28:27,541
-Hang on.
-I've been calling you for hours.

1022
01:28:27,615 --> 01:28:30,641
-What the fuck, Robert!
-Jesus Christ! Hang on.

1023
01:28:31,219 --> 01:28:32,618
What did you say to her?

1024
01:28:32,687 --> 01:28:33,984
-Elaine?
-Yes, Elaine!

1025
01:28:34,055 --> 01:28:36,888
-What did you show her?
-Nothing. Nothing.

1026
01:28:37,692 --> 01:28:39,091
I don't believe you.

1027
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:41,628
-I'm sorry.
-Tell me what you did.

1028
01:28:41,696 --> 01:28:44,927
I just went over there for our meeting
and she was all riled up.

1029
01:28:44,999 --> 01:28:46,899
Oh, yes, and you did nothing.
You said nothing.

1030
01:28:46,968 --> 01:28:48,060
No!

1031
01:28:52,841 --> 01:28:54,570
Nothing to her at all?

1032
01:28:55,043 --> 01:28:57,307
I said she should speak to you.

1033
01:28:58,246 --> 01:28:59,611
I was sorry.

1034
01:28:59,981 --> 01:29:01,414
You're sorry?

1035
01:29:02,517 --> 01:29:03,814
You are....

1036
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:06,787
You are sorry.

1037
01:29:11,426 --> 01:29:13,587
Do I seem
enshrouded in illusion to you, Robert?

1038
01:29:13,661 --> 01:29:16,357
Do I seem less real to you?

1039
01:29:18,299 --> 01:29:22,167
I'm sorry if I don't live up to your standards.
The trouble is, I'm bisexual.

1040
01:29:22,237 --> 01:29:24,603
I like both. You want the truth?

1041
01:29:25,340 --> 01:29:28,798
But you're lucky to be only one thing.
I'm not. I'm not hiding in my marriage!

1042
01:29:28,877 --> 01:29:30,572
I need my marriage!

1043
01:29:33,781 --> 01:29:35,976
And not just for business reasons.

1044
01:29:36,050 --> 01:29:38,280
Jesus, half of Hollywood's
out of the fucking closet.

1045
01:29:38,353 --> 01:29:42,312
They're all on the covers of magazines,
proclaiming their pride.

1046
01:29:42,423 --> 01:29:44,482
Were you so....

1047
01:29:47,028 --> 01:29:49,553
I'm sorry I corrupted your poor little....

1048
01:29:49,631 --> 01:29:51,895
Give back the money
if it makes you feel so unhappy...

1049
01:29:51,966 --> 01:29:53,763
you have to piss in other people's wells.

1050
01:29:53,835 --> 01:29:57,396
I did not say anything to Elaine.

1051
01:29:57,472 --> 01:30:01,101
-She was very freaked out. She said...
-Yes, I got the note.

1052
01:30:02,110 --> 01:30:04,237
...that she had figured it out.

1053
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:08,114
And I said that I was very sorry.

1054
01:30:09,150 --> 01:30:11,414
You have no reason to tell me the truth.

1055
01:30:11,486 --> 01:30:13,420
I have no reason to lie.

1056
01:30:17,192 --> 01:30:21,424
You don't think
that she'd try to hurt herself?

1057
01:30:22,297 --> 01:30:23,787
Yeah. Any word?

1058
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:26,992
No. What? Tell me.

1059
01:30:28,803 --> 01:30:30,202
Tell me now.

1060
01:30:31,206 --> 01:30:32,901
No, I'm not driving.

1061
01:30:36,611 --> 01:30:38,135
Are they alive?

1062
01:30:40,181 --> 01:30:42,172
Tell me if they're alive.

1063
01:30:42,850 --> 01:30:44,647
Yes, Officer.

1064
01:30:45,086 --> 01:30:48,055
I would like to know
just the truth now, please.

1065
01:30:48,690 --> 01:30:51,784
No one survived the crash, sir.
They ran into a retaining....

1066
01:30:51,859 --> 01:30:53,656
The children are safe?

1067
01:30:54,896 --> 01:30:56,022
Sir.

1068
01:30:56,097 --> 01:30:58,463
A little boy and a little girl?
Max and Debbon?

1069
01:30:58,566 --> 01:31:01,000
There were two children in the vehicle.
Yes, sir.

1070
01:31:11,479 --> 01:31:12,810
All of them?

1071
01:31:14,849 --> 01:31:16,908
We can send someone for you.

1072
01:31:16,985 --> 01:31:19,613
There is going to be
the matter of identification.

1073
01:31:20,488 --> 01:31:22,456
I'm sorry to have to have....

1074
01:31:24,092 --> 01:31:25,457
Oh, God!

1075
01:31:42,143 --> 01:31:43,337
Help....

1076
01:31:50,952 --> 01:31:53,045
She drove them into a wall.
