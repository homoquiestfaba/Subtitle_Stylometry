1
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,515
Attila! Where are you, boy?
Did you get that rabbit?

2
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,076
Did ya? l bet you did.
My mighty hunter.

3
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,237
You vicious killer.
That's my dog.

4
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,078
That's my beast.

5
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,918
Come on. Gimme a kiss.

6
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,359
Wait a minute.
Wait a damn minute.

7
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,677
Attila!
And you call yourself security?

8
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,709
Don't change the subject.

9
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,915
Love child
Love child

10
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,998
Hey, George.
Born of poverty

11
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,270
You gonna just stand there,
or you gonna help me with these boxes?

12
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,198
Now whattaya
got me carryin', huh?

13
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,788
l got a deal on solar panels
and batteries.

14
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,878
Well, l told you l wasn't doing
any more improvements on the house.

15
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,672
l'm sellin' this place someday.

16
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,199
Yeah, right.

17
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,753
But l see you improved
the garden anyway.

18
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,075
Yeah, and that goddam rabbit
still got in there.

19
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,754
l told you. He went
under your fence, George.

20
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,199
- He did not.
- He did too.

21
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,552
Look, l put that fence a foot
and a half underneath the ground.

22
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,875
Well, it's a mystery, George.

23
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,355
Anyway, this solar outfit...

24
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,516
is gonna save you money,
and it's free.

25
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,192
So, happy birthday.

26
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,959
Thanks, Nate. Thank you.

27
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,909
Who's gonna
put it together? Huh?

28
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,871
Not me.

29
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,672
lt comes with a manual
in three different languages.

30
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,837
- Forget it.
- Look, if it's a car, l can fix it.

31
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,712
lt's in the garden,
l probably can grow it, but--

32
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,114
This is way out
of my neighbourhood.

33
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,993
Hey, you, uh,
you bringin' a date tonight?

34
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,588
No. You?

35
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,631
Well, l'm thinkin'
of askin' somebody.

36
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,354
When? Today?

37
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,754
You don't give 'em
much notice, do ya?

38
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,996
Well, you even
ask anybody? Huh?

39
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,795
Always ask Diana Ross,
but she never says yes to me.

40
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,991
- See ya.
- See ya later.

41
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,271
But you're never, ever
gonna return

42
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,756
To ease the fire
that within me burns

43
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,395
lt keeps me cryin', baby,
for you

44
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,956
Keeps me sighin', baby, for you

45
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,234
So won't you hurry
Come on, boy, see about me

46
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,316
- Come see about me
- Hey, Bill!

47
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,398
See about your baby
Come see about me

48
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,636
Hey, George. George!
l forgot to tell you, man.

49
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,238
Hold on. Hold on.

50
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,078
Doctor called.

51
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,236
Banes, will you
let me figure it out?

52
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,992
At 10-- At 10:00. At 10:00.

53
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,157
He want you que vayas

54
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,355
- He wants you to look at his window.
- Oh, man!

55
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,228
How ya doin', Lace?
You look great.

56
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,874
Yeah. How are

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,831
l got one left.
l need four more.

58
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,711
Wow. lt's going a lot better
than l expected.

59
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,910
Yeah, well, you know,
people sit down a lot around here.

60
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,075
Yeah.

61
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,395

00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,359
Hey, uh, Lace-- There's a-- There's
a party tonight at the Elkhorn Bar.

65
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,710
Why do they call it that?
There's no elk around here.

66
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,751
Well, l don't know. They've just
always called it the Elkhorn.

67
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,314
Why? They got some poor
elk's horn hanging over the bar?

68
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,590
l don't think so.

69
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,711
Anyway, it's
my birthday today, and...

70
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,876
there's a party tonight
at the Elkhorn.

71
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,353
- l said that, didn't l?
- Yep.

72
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,959

00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,072
- Oh! l gotta look up here at 10:00.
- Why?

74
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,997
Well, that's Doc Brunder's office.
Have you met him yet?

75
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,795
- No. What does he want?
- l don't know.

76
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,036
So, uh, hey, uh, you think, you think,
you could come to the party tonight?

77
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,071
No, l don't like to leave
my kids home alone at night.

78
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,872
- Well, l, l know a good
baby-sitter. Tito's wife.
- l just live really far out.

79
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,594
- You know, it's just really--
- You know Tito. Tito! Tito!

80
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,631
Hey, George.

81
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,273
Hey, that's nice.

82
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,079
Oh, God.

83
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,556
- So, that's the doctor, huh?
- Yep, that's the doctor.

84
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,999
Crazy doc.

85
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,515

Well, then l'll keep askin'.

00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,191
Man, l would love to get

00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,311

91
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,472

00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,470

00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,113
- l told the press.
- Oh, man!

00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,954
-No media. No press. Just-- Just heaven.
-Nothin'.

101
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,354
Hey, you're not supposed

102
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,356
Yeah.

103
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,674
- Jimmy!
- Yo!

104
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,631
George doesn't buy drinks tonight.
lt's his birthday.

105
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,672
- Hey. For you.
- Hey, Doc. Hey, you made it.

106
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,711

00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,637

00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,751
- Doc, you gotta--

- Hey, you guys.

109
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,917
-Tito's wife made it. lt is macho bueno.
-As usual.

110
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,678
Come on. Open it, George.
Open it.

00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,392
- Oh, Doc. Th-Thank you.
- Hey, Jimmy!

112
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,397
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.

113
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,999
You're learning the moves, George,
but you've never played...

114
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,714
against turmoil and confusion,
so here we go.

115
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,274
l wish we could go back
to checkers. Maybe l could win.

116
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,755
No, no, no, no, no. No, no.
You have potential, George.

117
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,758
l always said, ''George Malley has
something extra to offer this world.''

118
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,156
l said that the day l, uh,
circumcised you.

119
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,511
- He says that every birthday.
- lt was a bad joke, l know.

120
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,039
You know, you ruined my chance
of romance today...

121
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,639
with that obscene stunt
in the window.

122
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,035
- lt was an outrage.
lt was a disgrace.
- lt was a criminal act.

123
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,991
Okay, there was a beautiful girl
who walked right away from me.

124
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,235
lt was so embarrassing.

125
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,588
George, you talkin' about
the woman with the chairs?

126
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,596
Yeah.

127
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,438
Man, they are not
all that comfortable.

128
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,790
Well, l think they're perfect.
You gotta learn how to sit in 'em.

129
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,388
Ah, here you go.
On the house, everybody.

130
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,669
- All right.
- Jimmy. Jimmy.

131
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,199
There's no smoking section
in heaven.

132
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,151
Ah, don't start, Doc.
Don't start.

133
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,430
- George. George.
- Pass 'em out. Pass em' out.

134
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,994
- Hey, buddy.
- George.

135
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,950

00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,791
Great. This is great.

Tito, wait, wait, wait. Tito!

139
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,160

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,879
Yup, happy birthday.

Thirty-seven.

143
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,638
Thirty-seven.

144
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,915
Anybody see that?
Th-Th-- There was that light--

145
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,350

- Th-Th-Th-There was a noise.
D-D-D-Did ya hear it?

146
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,598
-No.
-Can we finish the game, George?

147
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,510
Man, it, it, it was like, like, like, an
explosion, and, and, and it was a flash!

148
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,519
- Like a plane?
- No. lt was bigger than that.
lt wa-wa-wa-was farther away.

149
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,359
Oh, you mean,
like a star, George?

150
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,516
Man, it knocked me off my feet.

151
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,074
- You fell?
- Yeah, l fell. l was--

152
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,630
The man's inebriated.

00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,955
- l warned you.
- l am not drunk, Nate.

154
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,197

156
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,591
That's checkmate, isn't it?

157
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,472
You mean he beat you?

158
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,716
You let him win, Doc?
Birthday present?

159
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,512
l didn't let him win anything.

160
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,995
You're a little pissed off
about that, aren't ya?

161
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,351
- Play another one?
- Y-Y-You can get your revenge

166
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,558
That was a good party.

167
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,549
Oh, l can't sleep.

168
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,235
That's it!

169
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,230
- What?
- l figured it out.

170
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,318
Jesus, George, what are you
doing calling me? lt's late.

171
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,590
l thought that farmers got up
when it was still dark?

172
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,874
That's if you have cows.
l don't have any cows, George.

173
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,594
Now look. There's only one
explanation for that rabbit.

174
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,948
What?

175
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,957
You see, when l built
that fence higher and deeper,

176
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,354
he was already in there.

177
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,314
See, he was hiding.
l fenced him in.

178
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,831
- There's only one thing l
can do now. Just let him out.
- Good night, George.

179
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,359
Good night.

180
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,389
- Here's Roger.
- George, can l have my Bronco back?

181
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,875
l don't have any cash right now,
but l need my car.

182
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,798
Well, l need some solar panels
installed on my roof.

183
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,673
- l don't know
anything about solar.
- Well, Charlie Shipper does,

184
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,075
and, uh, he needs a well
dug on his property.

185
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,272
You help him dig the well, he'll help me
with the panels, and l'll fix your car.

186
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,868
Deal?

187
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,672
Yeah, deal.

188
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,112
l'll, uh, l'll call Charlie.

189
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,913
Hi. l just called
about, uh, fixin' my brakes.

190
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,792
Oh, yeah, yeah. l'll be right
with ya. Uh, Tito--

191
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,716
- Come on.
- Tito, he speaks Spanish
better than l do now.

192
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,513
Yeah, better than me too.

193
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,677
All right. Where's the owner
and operator of this vehicle?

194
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,837
- You a cop?
- Our mom's in the store.

195
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,430
- Mm-hmm. You got the brake on, sport?
- His name's Al.

196
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,312
- And what's your name?
- Glory.

197
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,669
Well, l'm George.
Pop the hood, Al.

198
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,359
Why?

199
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,959
You know how
to start this thing?

200
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,229
Duh.

201
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,029
Ah! Emergency
road service, ma'am.

202
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,593
Your truck can't breathe
and your idle's too fast.

203
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,314
Mmm, sorry. Gotta go.

204
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,000
Where? You're not, uh,
leavin' town, are ya?

205
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,076
No, just San Francisco,
for the day.

206
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,998
Oh, l used to live there. Uh, a-a-ask,
ask me directions on where you're goin'.

207
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,156
As a matter of fact,
ask me anything at all.

208
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,395
You could even ask me
to come along.

209
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,351
l'd show you the sights,
hazards. Whattaya think?

210
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,119
l think your idle's too fast.

211
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,470
San Francisco, huh?
But you were born here, right?

212
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,831
- How did you know l was born here?
- Just now, in the store. Someone said:

213
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,757
''l've known George Malley all my life,

214
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,668
and if he said he saw a UFO,
he saw one''.

215
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,552
l didn't say that.

216
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,752
- You saw one?
- But l didn't say what l saw.

217
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,632
What'd it look like?

218
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,512
Well, it could've been.

219
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,514
That's 'mate, Doc.

220
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,551
Wait, wait, wait! Wait, George!

221
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,434
Now, what in the hell
is goin' on here? What?

222
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,074
Look, you know, l don't know,
Doc. l-l-l really don't.

223
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,351
Just lately l've been, been
seeing things so clearly, you know?

224
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,950
And, uh, you know, uh,
l understand right away.

225
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:20,073
l concentrate. And books.
l can't stop feeding myself.

226
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,760
l read two, two, three books a day.
lmagine that.

227
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,318
And-And-And uh, you know, l can't stop
and l, l, can't sleep ever since the--

228
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,233
l-l-- l gotta go.
Get back to work.

229
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,113
Ever since the sighting.

230
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,358
- Roger, it was a damn light!
- And a boom.

231
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,833
Now, did you hear it?

232
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,875
Well, no. Anybody?
About nine days ago, right outside here?

233
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,959
Was that 12:00, George?

234
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,514
George, come in for a physical, okay?

235
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,319
George?
Two or three books a day?

236
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,510
- At least.
- About what?

237
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,189
About everything. You know,
all the things l've wanted
to know about and learn.

238
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,958
Like what?

239
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,877
You tell me, Rog.

240
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,798
l mean, what have you always wanted
to know about and learn? Hmm?

241
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,916
Think about it.

242
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,035
l'm waiting for ignition

243
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,993
l'm looking for a spark

244
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,989
Any chance collision
and l light up in the dark

245
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,680
Such a mass of motion

246
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,394
Do not know where it goes

247
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:52,229
l move with the movement and

248
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,509
l have the touch

249
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,316
Any social occasion

250
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,238
lt's hello, how do you do

251
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,033
All those introductions

252
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,469
l never miss my cue

253
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,955
So before a question

254
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,197
So before a doubt

255
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,312
My hand moves out and

256
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,317
l have the touch

257
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,474
Lonely, only
wanting contact with you

258
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,355
Shake those hands

259
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,119
Shake those hands

260
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,037
Shake hands

261
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,599
Shake hands

262
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,151
l have the touch

263
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,390
CQ, this is W-B-6-Q-L-F
standing by.

264
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,035
Searcher out of Harmon, California.
ls anybody in the void tonight?

265
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,278
l'm lookin' for Diana Ross, but l'll
accept any voice in the English tongue.

266
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,519
ls that you, Diana?

267
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,469
- Hey, George.
- Now look, Nate.

268
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,751
You haven't sat until
you put your ass on one of
these home-made willow chairs. Okay?

269
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,950
Now l bought you a pair
so you could put your feet up.

270
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,437
Or, if you, uh, want a friend
to sit in there, if you decide
one day to invite someone over.

271
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,788
Whattaya think?

272
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,229
- l don't think they go, George
- Oh, what would you know?

273
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,555
Looks like a swap meet
blew in here.

274
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,956
Talk about needin' a woman's touch.
This is an emergency.

275
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,789
Hey, Nate. l've been workin'
on that solar kit you gave me.

276
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:38,232
l'm tellin' you, the whole field of
photovoltaics is, is just in babyland.

277
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,432
l mean, you know, th-the idea
that plants have been storing...

278
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,791
and, and using the sun's energy
since the birth of the world.

279
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,388
l mean, photosynthesis is,
is a model for us,

280
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,876
and, and we're just scratching
the surface of what we can do
with these silicon cells.

281
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,389
l'm tellin' ya. What?

282
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,799
What?

283
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,912
You just talk so fast, George,
and, and you know so much stuff.

284
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:06,192
l'm sorry.
l can't help it, Nate.

285
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,197
lt's okay.

286
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,038
- What is that?
- Oh, it's just computers
talking to computers.

287
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,230
Shh. Leave it,
leave it, leave it.

288
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,669
Ah, come on. The Morse code's
goin' too fast for you to pick that out.

289
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,155
No, no, no, no. lt's-- lt's--
l can hear it.

290
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,714
- Bull.
- No, l'll tell ya what it is.
A repeated pattern.

291
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,671
They're looping a message.

292
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:29,555
- ''Watering the golds F-Friday.''
- Yeah, yeah.

293
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,797
Now who'd be sending a coded message
like that in simple Morse?

294
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,639
Oh, man, look. l pick up like
two different air force bases.

295
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,512
l think we better
leave this one alone, George.

296
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,108
Mm, no, no. This is
a different one. Listen, listen.

297
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,516
This one's much denser, but it's still
a loop; it still repeats. Listen.

298
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,118
- Seriously, l think we--
- Oh, l gotta record this.

299
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,912
- l think we need to leave this alone.
- Hey, where's your--

300
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,871
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What are you doin'?

301
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,798
Well, l want to take it home
so l can break it down,
and then we can answer it.

302
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,753
- Why?
- Because it gives me
something to do, Nate.

303
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,788
l don't know if it's getting worse
or it's gettin' better, but--

304
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,798
You know, l have 12 hours
in the night to kill, and l--

305
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,357
When l get tired of reading,
l do crossword puzzles,
but they're all too simple.

306
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,472
Too simple?

307
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,558
And then everybody l know is asleep,
and l'm, l'm awake at night.

308
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,114
ls there something, um,
something l could do?

309
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,630
Hey! Why don't we
just go outside and box?

310
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,832
l could split your lip again.
You'll-- Ya-- You'll feel a lot better.

311
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,188
No!

312
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,076
Hey, if you send a message,
would they get it?

313
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,395
Yeah, sure. Um--

314
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,192
Send this. Send them...

315
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,880
''Don't, uh-- Don't overwater
the golds.'' Say that.

316
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,912
- Okay, fine. The golds?
- Marigolds.
- Oh, yeah.

317
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,555
No, no, no. Say:
''Don't overwater the marigolds Friday.''

318
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,240
''Don't overwater...

319
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,716
- the marigolds on Friday.''
- Right.

320
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,035
- ''We'll be watching.''
- Yeah, yeah. We'll be watching.
- How does that sound?

321
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,355
Oh, my God. This is cool.

322
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,276
lt's okay, Attila. lt's nothing.
Static electricity, that's all.

323
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,675
That's all it is.

324
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,310
See, here. Here you go.

325
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,591
Okay. All right. Okay.

326
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,519
Oh, God.

327
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,598
Oh, God! Oh, man!

328
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,236
ls somebody trying
to tell me something? Huh?

329
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,310
What?

330
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,796
- Did ya pee in the cup?
- Yep.

331
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,673
- Still having trouble sleeping?
- Yep. Any ideas?

332
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,599
How long you been
feeling this way?

333
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,438
You know how long
l've been feeling this way.

334
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:35,190
Everybody does. lt's been
over a month since my birthday.

335
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,788
Notice anything else, or--

336
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,957
- Yeah.
- What?

337
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,915
- Well, watch your fountain pen there.
- Whattaya mean?

338
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,717
- lt's telekinesis.
- Yeah.

339
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,079
ls that okay?

340
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,990
Do it again. Do it again.

341
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,876
You know, l consider myself
a rational man. A man of science.

342
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,597
You know, open to whatever.
But, uh, l feel like a child, George.

343
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,280
- l feel scared.
- Me too.

344
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,117
Well, whatever the reason is,
l promise you we'll find it. Okay?

345
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,071
Now, let me see you
do that one more time.

346
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,431
lt's a monster, George.

347
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:03,236
Yep, yep. This old Frankenstein here
gets 90 miles to the gallon on methane,

348
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,955
and it's made from my garbage
and Nate's pig manure.

349
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,152
- Special blend.
- Sure smells like it.

350
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,591
See, Georgie.

351
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,119
- Hello, Lace.
- Hey. These are a little bit different.

352
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,835
- l used a little bit
of a wider branch on these.
- Yeah, they look great.

353
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,949
George, are these yours?

354
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,036
Yeah, yeah. l've been
working on some, uh,

355
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,798
special organic fertilizers.

356
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,797
- Go ahead. Taste it.
- Mmm.

357
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,639
No, no, no. Bite into it
like a, like an apple.

358
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,196
You got some on your chin. Sorry.

359
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,197
Maybe, uh, maybe
the kids would like some?

360
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,515
- lt's great. Thanks.
- No, no, no. Wait. Wait.

361
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,959
Let me pick some out for you.

362
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,308
lf the kids like them, you know,

363
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,874
y-y-you could make anything.

364
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,877
You could make a sauce or a soup.

365
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,479
George, l thought you were smart.

366
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,477
Hey, what she got, anyway?

367
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,955
Yeah, yeah,
besides uncomfortable chairs.

368
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,718
My heart, amigos. My heart.

369
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,070
Jump in, let's go

370
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,192
Lay back, enjoy the show

371
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,395
Jump in, let's go

372
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,271
These are the days
when anything goes

373
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,710
Every day is a winding road

374
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,275
l get a little bit closer

375
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,029
Every day is a faded sign

376
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,030
- l get a little bit closer
- Hey, George! Where do you
think you're goin'?

377
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,515
- To feelin' fine
- You guys going home?

378
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,959
You want a ride?

379
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,752
- Okay.
- Glory!

380
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,350
- Oh, what?
- Glory, come on.

381
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,438
- Would you come on?
- All right.

382
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,232
- Al!
- Okay.

383
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,920
Hurry. Hurry up!

384
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,672
Jump in, let's go

385
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,997
These are the days
when anything goes

386
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,513
Every day is a winding road
l'm feelin' fine

387
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,154
- Are those for our mom?
- Yep.

388
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,030
l thought flowers were for dates.

389
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,632
- Don't get spooky, Al.
- Did she invite you?

390
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,878
Hey, wait a minute!

391
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,309
Blue. l don't have blue.

392
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,797
Every day is a winding road

393
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,188
- Every day is a winding road
- Oh, great.

394
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,631
- You guys know the name
of this, uh, this flower?
- No.
- No.

395
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,830
A Delphinium belladonna.

396
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,110
That's the Ranunculaceae family.

397
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,673
l didn't always know
the names of flowers,

398
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,475
but it seems, recently, that l can
pretty much name any flower l see.

399
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,639
- Mmm.
- Yeah. Like this one
is Lamonium Sabbatom.

400
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,352
And, uh, this is the, uh--

401
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,239
Doesn't make them
any prettier though.

402
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,992
ls that a garbage bag tie?

403
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,715
Yeah. l was improvising.

404
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,592
Hey, now, that's a good idea.

405
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,555
Ah, that's much better.

406
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,749
Yep.

407
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,233
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

408
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,952
Every day is a winding road

409
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,430
Every day is a winding road

410
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,957
My mom's around back!

411
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,676
Every day is a winding road

412
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,791
Lace?

413
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,515
- Hi.
- Hi.

414
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,551
Now, you didn't nearly
take enough tomatoes,

415
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,558
and l'm very proud of them.

416
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,275
Well, there you go. And, uh--

417
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,630
l got you these.

418
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,832
Well, that's every wildflower
from my, my house to your house.

419
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,234
Your kids helped.

420
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,510
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

421
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,791
- Hey, what are ya workin' on?
- Nah, nothin'.

422
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,876
Nothing.

423
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,276
Wow, that's, that's really great work.
Look at this.

424
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,756
- Beautiful.
- Ah, you want to, um, walk?

425
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,871
Sure.

426
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,276
- Shh.
- l-l-l gotta tell ya,
you know, you got great kids.

427
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,551
Yeah, they are great kids, but you
don't really know that yet, George,

428
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,717
because you don't know them,
and you don't know me.

429
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,673
-Well, uh, l'm tryin' to get to know ya.
-l know.

430
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,155
l-- l really want to keep
my life very simple.

431
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,669
Even predictable.
That's why l moved here.

432
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,870
l don't like surprises,
and l don't like complications.

433
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,473
What happened to you, Lace?

434
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,153
Ah, l'm sorry.
Th-That's none of my business.

435
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,952
- No, no. That's okay.
- l'm stupid.

436
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:19,119
- l'm so sorry.
- So let me ask you something, George.

437
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,516
When a man comes over with a basketful
of tomatoes, what is he expecting?

438
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,395
- Dinner?
- No, no, no. Just hoping.

439
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,991
Trifolium?

440
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,079
Y-Y-You don't have any purple
in those flowers l got you, do ya?

441
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,919
Whoa. D-D-Did ya feel that?

442
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,712
Feel what?

443
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,558
Whoa.

444
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,431
W-W-Well, come here.
Come here. That's it.

445
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,039
Okay.

446
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,311
- Feel that. Right there.
- Feel what?

447
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,551
Oh, God. l think
l know what this is.

448
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,159
- What?
- C-C-Could l use your phone?

449
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,272
Yeah.

450
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,595
Okay, yeah.

451
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,917
Just east of Harmon.
You know which one l'm talking about?

452
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,600
No, l-l was told to call you,
and l'm telling you right now...

453
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,472
that l picked up
on some activity.

454
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,031
No, we didn't use
any instrumentation.

455
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,391
No, l don't have a degree
and l haven't studied anywhere,
but l'm just tryin' t--

456
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,433
Are you shutting me down here?
ls that what's going on?
Are you trying to shut me down?

457
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,597
Look l'm just tryin' to tell you
that l felt the compression waves, okay?

458
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,029
ULF. Ultra-low frequency waves.
Now, now, they have...

459
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,435
the ability to make you
nauseous and dizzy. Am l right?

460
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,312
Okay, well, that's what l felt!

461
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,635
And-- And l'm tryin' to tell you
that, that l think that there--

462
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,112
There's an earthquake coming.

463
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,989
Um, listen, Al. Why don't you put
some masking tape on the cupboards?

464
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,714
And, Glory, bring
the vases down and the china.

465
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,233
This is good, Lace.

466
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,073
- l think you're a good cook.
- No, l'm not.

467
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,591
l only make two things pretty well.
Pork chops and, um, turkey.

468
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,630
Which is this?

469
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,156
l'm just--

470
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,874
Look!

471
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,754
- Al.
- Hmm.

472
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,632
- Oh, you.
- l was just joking.

473
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,797
Oh, please.

474
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,990
Oh, you scared me.

475
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,878
Not funny.

476
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,678
Thanks.

477
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,315
- All right. Can l say it now?
- What's that?

478
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,590
- You've got great kids.
- Oh, thanks.

479
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,676
- And l thank you for dinner.
- You're welcome.

480
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,633
- And good night.
- Good night.

481
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,557
Good night.

482
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,792
- Shh. She's coming.
- Tell her.

483
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,956
- No, you tell her.
- Shh.

484
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,798
- Shh.
- Come on.

485
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,235
- He's neat.
- Yeah, he's nice, isn't he?

486
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,670
Yeah, but he thinks he saw a UFO and
he thinks he can predict earthquakes.

487
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,552
There may be a warning here.

488
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,592
- But he never said
for sure it was a UFO.
- Yeah.

489
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,756
Oh, Jesus! Doorway! Doorway!

490
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,348
Let's get in the truck.
Get in the truck.

491
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,789
- lt's over, Mom.
- l know it's over. Let's go. Now.

492
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,876
Did you feel it, huh?

493
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,036
Did you get scared, huh?

494
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,799
Do you realize
the possibilities of this, huh?

495
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,672
Do you know what this means?

496
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,357
You felt it, didn't you?

497
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,072
- You did!
- What is going on, George?

498
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,395
- Wasn't that amazing?
- Tell me what's happening.

499
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,080
l don't know. l don't--
l don't know.

500
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,350
l need the simple truth, George.

501
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,870
This is the truth. W-W-W-What's
happening to me i-i-is the truth.

502
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,958
Oh, no.

503
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,994
Lace.

504
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,234
l love those chairs, Lace.
l love them. l didn't--

505
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,309
Y-You made them. Okay?
All right?

506
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,592
l wanted to see you, okay?
l mean--

507
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,836
Bring them back to the shop tomorrow.
l'll give you your money back.

508
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,154
l don't want
my money back, Lace.

509
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,111
l just asked you
for one thing, George.

510
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,391
The truth.
And you couldn't handle it.

511
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,550
- George, haven't you called her yet?
- Never mind about that, will ya?

512
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,079
N-N-Now this is the second one.
Gladiolus. Remember that.

513
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,758
How do you know
she's still mad at you?

514
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,359
l know. Now, all right.

515
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,436
- Write her a note.
- No, no, no. l found this.

516
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,391
Classic five-bed garden pattern. Here.

517
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,988
Flowers. You should send
her flowers or candies.

518
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,350
Yeah. Marigolds, gladiolus,
roses, etcetera.

519
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,277
And l went to the library...

520
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,836
and l looked up the missile silo pattern
at the Masterson Air Force Base,

521
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,155
and l made my, my own overlay.

522
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,113
And here we go. There.

523
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,198
- Yeah.
- See, that, that's their,
that's their garden.

524
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,072
You see? Well, that's old stuff.

525
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,758
lt's, uh, and it's, uh,
declassified.

526
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,359
But now this stuff is trickier.

527
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,552
This is, uh, trigraphs
and tetragraphs and ABBA class.

528
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,749
- George--
- Yep?

529
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,871
Why don't you just tell me
what you want me to send?

530
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,798
All right. Send this.
Why don't you send this?

531
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,434
''Mind your garden. Frost coming.
Luck on the Mozop.''

532
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,152
Want to know what Mozop is?

533
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,475
lt's okay.
lt's your game, George.

534
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,636
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Have you sat in this chair yet?

535
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,034
- lt's nice.
- Yeah, yeah.

536
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,229
You should give her
a call right now.

537
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:16,750
Naw. Let her cool off.

538
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,235
l figure l'll give her 'bout a year.

539
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,113
Pick up the phone and call her, George.

540
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,037
Look who's talkin'.

541
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,391
Diana Ross fan club, right? Have
you said ten words to a woman this year?

542
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,477
- Ah, l'm sorry, Nate.
- Your transmission's finished, sir.

543
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,831
l've just been going
through some things lately.

544
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,837
Everybody's going through somethin'.

545
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,748
l know, but, uh, this thing's
been hard for me to handle.

546
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,914
Let me show you somethin'.

547
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,076
You suppose they magnetized you?

548
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,476
l don't know, buddy. l wish l did.

549
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,557
- What we got here?
- Doc, are we glad to see you.
You better hurry. This man--

550
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,953
One of you go to the garbage and
bring me any food containers you find.

551
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:50,710
Somebody else, go in the cabinets
and look for damaged or swollen cans.

552
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,115
- Food poisoning.
- l think.

553
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,470
Now what the hell is he saying?
Who speaks Spanish?

554
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,955
That's Portuguese.
They just came in last week.

555
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,638
Portuguese?

556
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,357
He's trying to tell us
something about Berto.

557
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,118
That's the little one.
lt's a little boy.

558
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,037
All right, some of you
search around here for the kid.

559
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,628
l'm gonna tell you right now,
he could be pretty darn sick.

560
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,716
Now, Bonnie, wait. Uh--

561
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,956
Get on the phone
and get George Malley over here.

562
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,470
Tell him what's goin' on, and
tell him to stop at the library
for an English/Portuguese book.

563
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:22,559
Tell him to find out how to ask
where a lost boy is.

564
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,875
- Got that?
- George Malley?

565
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,195
You bet. George.

566
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,719
Go on. Do it. Just go on. Go on!

567
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,352
Don't you answer that?

568
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,471
Not when l'm workin'.

569
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,275
l've been farmin' all my life,
but this growth is amazing, George.

570
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,599
-This is embarrassin'.
-You know, l wanna try this
fertilizer on your south 40.

571
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,711
You just sprayed my boots.

572
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,114
lt's the worst soil in the county.

573
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,356
Can't even get weeds
to grow in that field.

574
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,072
But l bet we can get corn
to grow in that field.

575
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,317
You bet? You don't have
any money to bet.

576
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,158
You spent all your money
on chairs, remember?

577
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,113
George Malley?

578
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:22,437
- Yeah, l'm George Malley.
- l'm John Ringold.

579
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,391
We talked on the phone the other day.

580
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,635
- John Ringold?
- Yes.

581
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,113
- From Berkeley?
- Yes.

582
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,437
All right. Hi. Hey,
l'm glad you came by.

583
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,710
- Will your dog let me step out?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

584
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,400
Well, he just has a thing
for seismologists.

585
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,476
- Yeah, come on out.
- Thank you.

586
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,113
Yeah, this is
my friend, Nate Pope.

587
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,992
- How do?
- How do you do?

588
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,792
W-W-Well, let me get you
a cold drink. Come on in.

589
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,638
- From the university, huh?
- Yes.
- Uh-huh.

590
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,637
And, uh, we are
very interested in how...

591
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,513
you were able to predict
that earthquake, Mr Malley.

592
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,517
Oh, that.

593
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,791
You see, l, l, just picked up
the subsonic frequency waves, right?

594
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,480
And, of course, l was standing
on the fault, so that made it easier.

595
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,990
- W-W-What instrumentation did you use?
- Just me.

596
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,078
lf you think that's somethin',
you should see him
move stuff with his brain.

597
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,159
Nate, never mind that. You see,
l felt the ultra-low frequency waves,

598
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,635
and they kind of made me
dizzy and nauseous, right?

599
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,034
And that's how
l perceived all this.

600
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,119
We've been studying quake prediction
for ten years.

601
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,994
There's no record of any person
ever feeling the pre-quake activity.

602
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,997
Now there is.

603
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,071
We have some ULF equipment
in our labs.

604
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,792
Could you come in
for an experiment?

605
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,229
- Come to Berkeley?
- Yes.

606
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,271
Yes.

607
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,039
Well, my department would like
to interview you and clear this up.

608
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,118
l-l-l would be-- l would be
so glad to come to Berkeley.

609
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,073
Do you-- Do you think l could meet
w-w-with some other departments as well?

610
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,953
l-l-l have some experiments l'd,
l'd like to show you. Come with me.

611
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,995
They're nice.

612
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,476
All right. Well, uh, let's see.

613
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,388
Um-- Oh, oh, yes.
Here. Okay, now look, um--

614
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,512
l've taken solar panels, and
l've actually germinated the seeds...

615
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,631
t-that made these,
these, these plants grow.

616
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,478
l'm trying to change
the electromagnetic field, right?

617
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,558
- Um, Mr Malley?
- l took, uh, incandescent lighting,

618
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,954
- Mr Malley?
- and l turned it into sunlight,

619
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,116
which actually made
these, these plants grow.

620
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,276
- Mr Malley?
- Oh, now, look--

621
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,870
l-l took pig manure,
and l turned it into a f-fuel...

622
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,513
which l-l believe
will actually run an automobile.

623
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,676
All l'm interested in
is the earthquake.

624
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:25,193
We need to know if
that was a fluke, a coincidence.

625
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,834
A fluke?

626
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,428
George, why don't you
move something with your mind?

627
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,069
Maybe move his, uh,
something like that?

628
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,112
- Look, Mr Ringold--
- Doctor.

629
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,994
D-D-Doctor Ringold, uh,
l-l-- Look, l--

630
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,873
l've got-- l've got my garden out there,
and t-t-that acts like a lab, right?

631
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,070
And l, l got everything
that you see here, but l--

632
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,316
- l really need to talk
to people like you, okay?
- Hey, George!

633
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,398
- George, are you home?
- Please don't go, okay?

634
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,909
- George, get out here!
- Please-- Just please don't go.

635
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,679
Hey, George!

636
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,995
George, Doc says,
you better come right now!

637
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,155
What's the matter?

638
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,316
Come on, man.
lt's an emergency!

639
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,431
You gotta learn how to talk Portuguese
on the way over there.

640
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,915
l gotta go.

641
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,191
Portuguese? Learn Portuguese?

642
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,158
Why don't you go along, Professor?

643
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:35,157
George, Doc's inside.
He thinks it's food poisoning.

644
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,714
Hey, George.

645
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:41,958
- Hey, Doc. George is here.
- He's gonna be fine, George,
but his grandson is missing.

646
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,310
Now, if they ate the same thing,
the boy could be a lot worse off.

647
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,589
You brought the book?

648
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,994
- Yeah, l have it.
- All right. Okay.

649
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,111
Ask him where the boy is?

650
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,592
He's in orchard.
He said he's in the orchard.

651
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,869
All right. Okay.

652
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:08,198
He said that they ate something bad,
and he thinks the b-- the boy is sick.

653
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,594
Tito drove the truck
while l-l read the book.

654
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,475
George Malley. You learned
the Portuguese language in 20 minutes?

655
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:36,273
Not all of it.

656
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,233
- What are we lookin' for here, a kid?

00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,829

00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,598
- Okay.

660
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,199

George, whatcha got!

669
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,036
Huh? What?

670
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,957
- He's not in the orchard.
- Huh?

671
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,832
He's sick, Doc.

672
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:06,552
- He's there.
- Where is he, George? Where?

673
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,671

- Okay. Let's go.

674
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,314
We're with you.
We're with you.

675
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,152
What's goin' on?

676
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,796
You okay, George?

677
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,354
lt's not me. lt's him.

678
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,199
Tell me where he is.

679
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,835
l don't know. l don't know.

680
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,638
Look! There's a ladder under there!

681
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,310
Come on.

682
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,954
He was right!

683
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,877
He's up here!

684
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,072
Doc! Better get up here fast.

685
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,997
Good work, George.

686
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:41,314
- So, is, uh, Wednesday
good for you? Say 2:00?
- Sure. Wednesday's good.

687
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,874
-Should l send a car?
-No, no, John. l'll get there on my own.

688
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,275
And, and l'll, l'll have somebody
from solar energy there.

689
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,551
And, uh, anything else?

690
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,036
Yeah, automotive. Hey, d-d-d-do you have
an agricultural school at Berkeley?

691
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,277
- Yeah.
- Well, how 'bout for my fertilizer?

692
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,118
l'll take care of it.

693
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,639
Hey, George.

694
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,470
That's the little boy's mom.

695
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,556
She's the only one
who talks English, l think.

696
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,875
Oh, it's too bad
she wasn't here earlier, huh?

697
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,675
Yeah. But l guess
she had to look for work, man.

698
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,677
l want you to meet
a very special guy.

699
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,792
This is the-- This is the man
who, who found your son, okay?

700
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,150
Very special.
This is George Malley.

701
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:33,477
- This is Ella.
- Hello.

702
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,349
- Thank you.
- lt's okay.

703
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,870
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

704
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,150
l'll take you
to the hospital, okay?

705
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,838
Thanks, George.

706
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:55,236
- Way to go, patron.
- Do you know what kind of work
she was looking for?

707
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:58,079
Hmm, cook, l think they say.
Housekeeper.

708
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,518
You know somebody who's looking?

709
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,994
- All right, Nate.
- Thanks, George.

710
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,509
l found a housekeeper for you.
A Portuguese woman.

711
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,870
She cooks too.
l think she's perfect for you.

712
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,797
l don't know if l could
eat Portuguese food, George.

713
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,911
Well, she'll cook ya
anything you want, Nate,

714
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:19,316
and she'll try to make sense of
that so-called house that you live in.

715
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,193
- She speak English?
- Well, a bit, but, uh--

716
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,390
That's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna work on your Portuguese.

717
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,988
- Me?
- Yeah! You got a problem with that?

718
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,237
No, no. lt's, uh-- l don't know
if that's gonna work, George.

719
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,999
All right, Well, let's try it.
What do you wanna say?

720
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,592
How 'bout, uh,
something like, um, um--

721
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:41,076
- Can you come twice a week?
- Okay. Can you come twice a week?

722
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,918
Okay. Can you come twice a week?

723
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,630
That sounds complicated, George.

724
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,673
Oh, no. You got your tape recorder, and,
and, uh, you'll learn it phonetically.

725
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,030
No problem. What else?

726
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,958
Uh, how much per day?

727
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,833
How much per-- Oh, okay, good.
How much per day?

728
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:11,072
- l like that one.
- Yeah? Yeah.
- That was nice. Okay. Okay.
- What else?

729
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:15,193
Um, ah--
Can you start next week?

730
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:18,232
- Perfect. Logical, right? Okay.
- Yeah. Yeah.

731
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,839
Can you start next week?

732
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,428
Beautiful language, huh?

733
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,596
- That's it?
- Yep. Work on those.

734
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,797
You know, George,
l might be pretty good at Portuguese.

735
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:49,629
No-- Oh, never mind.
We'll get used to 'em.

736
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,228
lf you leave them alone,
they'll leave you alone.

737
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,237
lt's a good arrangement.

738
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,920
- What are we reading?
- This.

739
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,837
What is this?
Where did you get this?

740
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:03,590
- From me.
- This is not a good choice for bedtime.

741
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,393
- Are you still mad at him?
- What's the difference?

742
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:09,080
He's neat, and they say...

743
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,634
he saved that boy's life
at the orchard.

744
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,034
He's funny.

745
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,720
We are funny enough.
We laugh all the time.

746
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,991
Look, we're reading Black Beauty,
and we are not talking about men.

747
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:25,715
l've got enough to worry about.
Too much.

748
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:28,479
- What?
- Well, you guys, for one.

749
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,272
We're not little any more.

750
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,197
l know you're not
little any more, sweetie,

751
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:36,029
but you think that George Malley
is safe, and you're afraid of coyotes.

752
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,835
You've got it all backwards.
Here. Find our place.

753
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,349
Go brush your teeth.
l'll be right back.

754
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,516
- Don't you have a report to do?
- Did it.

755
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,196
''They're everywhere--''
Oh, Al. Do you really believe this?

756
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:54,357
Yeah. There's been a lot of UFO people
coming into town...

757
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,553
since George saw what he saw.

758
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:01,319
- The word's spreading, Ma.
- You just believe
what you wanna believe.

759
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,635
Most people do.
You get over it.

760
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:11,076
- Hey, l thought we were
getting ready for bed.
- No.

761
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:19,197
- Stop talking about him, all right?
- Why do you hate him?

762
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:22,118
- 'Cause l like him.
- Told you.

763
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,071
Told you.

764
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,875
But if he was sitting here with us
right now, wouldn't you be watching him,

765
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,753
wondering, ''What's he thinking?''

766
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,996
''When's he gonna leave?''

767
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,873
''ls he gonna leave?'' Hmm?

768
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,192
We don't need that.

769
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,678
lt's okay. Shh.

770
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,797
l heard he took 20 minutes.

771
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,309
Twenty minutes, he read
the whole damn book, knew Portuguese.

772
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:53,079
- You were there. He was too!
- And then he went
running around in the orchard.

773
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,316
Shh. Here he comes. Here he comes.

774
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,234
- Hey, George.
- Hello.

775
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:03,319
- Hi.
- Hi.

776
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:08,992
- So, George. How did you
feel that earthquake comin'?
- Voices tell ya?

777
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:12,351
- Voices? Hell no.
- What else do you know, George?

778
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,713
Well, l know you're on
the outs with Lisa again.

779
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,831
- How did you know that?
- Well, 'cause when
she's livin' with you,

780
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,871
she makes sure
your clothes match.

781
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,752
Poor Banes.

782
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,518
Do you get messages, George?

783
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,074
Yeah, well, yeah, uh,
when Paulette delivers the mail l do.

784
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,395
But, uh, today
s-she was two hours late.

785
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,556
l think we oughta
do something about that.

786
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,591
Complain or somethin'.

787
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,233
Earthquake, earthquake. Can we--

788
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,032
Well, it-- You know, Jimmy,
it was just, uh--

789
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,310
l was out by Ash Creek,
and l felt some vibrations. That's all.

790
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,192
How'd you know where to find
the boy in that orchard?

791
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,912
Well, l don't know, Bonnie.
l mean, come on.

792
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,359
Do you know what's going to happen?

793
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,390
Roger, come on!

794
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,397
l'm sorry, l'm--

795
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,875
They say at the library
you read four books a day now.

796
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,991
Yeah, well, that was
last week and, uh--

797
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,630
Ah, l-l better go.

798
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,637
How many languages do you speak now?

799
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,273
Excusez-moi, Jimmy.

800
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,949
Huh? lf anything bad was
gonna happen, you'd tell us,

801
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,476

802
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,749
Hey!

803
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,675
Uh-huh.

00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,792

805
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,956

00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,798
Okay, thanks.

807
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,398
- Hi, Lace.
- Hello.

808
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,913
l'm sorry l lied to you
about the chairs.

809
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:43,475
l-- l just wanted you to come
to my shop so, so you would talk to me,

810
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:49,395
instead of, um, instead of
always walking away from me.

811
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,795
What do you want, George?

812
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,837
l want you to come
to Berkeley with me.

813
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,838
l-l-l've been invited
to talk to, uh, some scientists...

814
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,918
about the earthquake thing
and about some of my, my experiments.

815
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,952
You know, the, the fertilizer
and the solar panels and--

816
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:09,153
- That's really nice.
- l'm excited, but l--

817
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,033
l guess l'm scared too.

818
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,311
- l sure would like you there with me.
- What for?

819
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:20,116
Support. Confidence. A friend.

820
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,789
You've got friends. You know
everyone in the whole area code.

821
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,593
l don't know, you know,
since that orchard thing, it's--

822
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,518
People are different now.
They're-- l don't like it.

823
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:32,598
You know, the funny thing is,
is that you're probably the only one...

824
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,792
that, that, that, that, that's mad at me
for a good reason.

825
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:43,033
You're just trying to make up.

826
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:47,039
Yes, l'm trying to make up with you,
l am tryin' to get a date with you,

827
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:52,109
and l would love it if you stood
by me while all those scientists
and teachers asked me questions.

828
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,834
You know, l-l-l spent
half of school in detention.

829
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,392
When?

830
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,239
- Wednesday.
- What time?

831
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:07,480
- Leave about noon.
- l'll be outside your shop
at noon, if l'm coming.

832
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,875
And if l'm not there--

833
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,389
Okay.

834
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,272
Thanks, Lace.

835
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:24,759
Touch me in the morning

836
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:30,196
Then just walk away

837
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:39,913
- We don't have tomorrow
- Uh, one second.

838
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,508
One second. Here l come.

839
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,913
You are Mister Pope?

840
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,838
You are Mister Pope?

841
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,951
l am Michaela.

842
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:00,550
M-Mich-Ella. Hmm.

843
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,636
- You're Ella?
- Yes.

844
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,994
Wow. Oh, l'm--
l'm sorry. Please.

845
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:10,510
Oh. Um, maybe you need to--

846
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,473
Yes, this is the place.

847
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:17,070
- l cook too. You need cooking?
- Cookin', yeah.

848
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,431
Good. Fine. Good.
Uh, how much you pay?

849
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:21,629
Uh--

850
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,078
Oh, wait, um--

851
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,551
l-l-l s-s-speak
a little Portuguese.

852
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,511
l don't know what you just said,
but it sounded great.

853
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,153
- Um--
- Sorry.

854
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:48,229
Okay. Uh, tomorrow
l come back. 9:00. Okay?

855
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:50,590
l work, and we talk about money.

856
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,712
No, wait.

857
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,073
That's all l really know.

858
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,191
That and, um--

859
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,114
ls that right?

860
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,118
You're cute.

861
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:21,997
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
- Mm-hmm.

862
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,991
Tomorrow, then.

863
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,438
CQ. CQ?

864
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:41,439
This is W-B-6-Q-L-F.

865
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:45,348
Diana, if you can hear me,

866
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:49,189
l know you'll understand this.

867
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,548
l just met...

868
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,354
an angel from Portugal.

869
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,188
Here. ln my house.

870
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,034
You George Malley?

871
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,355
Jack Hatch, FBl.

872
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:42,314
Nate Pope sent a coded message
to Masterson Air Force Base.

873
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:45,876
No, no, no, no.
Nate-- Nate Pope did not send
a coded message to the air force base.

874
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,310
- l-l did.
- Well, who taught you
the cipher, Mr Malley?

875
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,954
Nobody. l just broke,
broke the code.

876
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,911
Who trained you?

877
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,632
As l said, nobody, l--

878
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,996
Oh, man.

879
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,394
Mm-hmm.

880
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:14,189
Well?

881
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,033
Can't do it.

882
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:27,199
- You can do it, Mr Malley.
- Too complex.

883
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,758
We're releasing Nathan Pope.

884
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:38,637
lt's about time.
Can l talk to him?

885
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,079
No.

886
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:43,837
Try this one.

887
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:47,191
You know, i-it was just
a game, okay? l mean, a game.

888
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:50,915
You caused the cancellation
of a top secret training
exercise, Mr Malley.

889
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,793
The scrapping of
an entire cipher system.

890
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:57,117
You cost the government
a lot of money.

891
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,515
So bill me.

892
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,832
l think he's what
he says he is, a fluke.

893
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,032
He's an independent,
playing some kind of genius games.

894
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,435
l want him tested.

895
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:22,676
- Can't keep holdin' him.
- Yes, we can.

896
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,394
- He resisted arrest.
- No, he didn't.

897
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,078
Yes, he did.

898
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:30,519
Test him.

899
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,791
All right, l'll start the questions,

900
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,708
and l'll be timing your responses.

901
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,593
And we'll be recording. Any questions?

902
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,551
What's your first name?

903
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:44,432
Uh, my first name is Bob.

904
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,949
- Hi.
- Shoot, Bob.

905
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:50,672
Right.

906
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:54,395
Name as many mammals
as you can in sixty seconds.

907
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,317
Ready. Go.

908
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:01,116
Hmm. Sixty seconds. Well, how would
you like that? How about alphabetical?

909
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,912
Aardvark, baboon, caribou,

910
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:05,793
dolphin, eohippus, fox,
gorilla, hyena, ibex, jackal,

911
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,593
kangaroo, lion, marmoset,
Newfoundland, ocelot, panda,

912
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:13,191
rat, sloth, tiger, unicorn,
varmint, whale, yak, zebra.

913
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:16,949
Now, varmint is a stretch.
So is Newfoundland. That's a dog breed.

914
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:19,036
Unicorn is mythical.
Eohippus is prehistoric.

915
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,230
But you weren't being
very specific now, were you, Bob?

916
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,790
Well,

917
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:32,310
l'll-- l'll try to be more specific.

918
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:35,671
- You ready for the next one?
- Shoot.

919
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:41,079
Answer as quickly as you can.
How old is a person born in 1928?

920
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,156
Man or woman?

921
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,794
- Why?
- Specifics, Bob.

922
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:50,673
Okay, one more time.

923
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,872
How old is a man born in 1928?

924
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,115
Still alive?

925
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:03,155
lf a man is born in 1928,

926
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,555
and he's still alive, how old is he?

927
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:06,829
What month?

928
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:13,709
lf a man was born
October 3, 1928,

929
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,796
and he's still alive, how old is he?

930
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:19,390
- What time?
- 10:00.

931
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:20,873
- P.M.
- Where?

932
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,753
- Anywhere!
- Well, let's get specific, Bob.

933
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,074
l mean, if the guy's still alive,

934
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,192
born in California,
October 3, 1928, 10:00 p.m.,

935
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,834
he's 67 years, 9 months, 22 days,

936
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,554
14 hours and-- and 12 minutes.

937
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:36,592
lf he's born in New York,
he's three hours older now, isn't he?

938
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,199
How do you do that?

939
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:00,316
How do-- How do you
make that pencil move?

940
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,590
ls that a trick pencil?

941
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,632
No. l ask it to move.

942
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:10,880
l mean, l could say that l will it,
but that would be more like a command.

943
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,039
This is more like a collaboration,
a partnership.

944
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,674
- Partnership?
- Mm-hmm.

945
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:20,360
- With a pencil?
- Well, why not?

946
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:23,153
We're all made up
of the same stuff, aren't we?

947
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:28,999
- Wood?
- Energy, Bob.

948
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:31,270
- You know, the little pieces.
- Right.

949
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:35,393
l want to go home.
How the hell can l get home, Bob?

950
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:45,230
l don't know. Sorry.

951
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:00,749
Hey.

952
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,231
- They say you haven't slept.
- Mmm.

953
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:10,672
Who's that? My keepers?
l'm all right.

954
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,710
You know, you're
a pretty gifted man, Mr Malley.

955
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:18,799
No, no, really.
We were hopin'--

956
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:20,433
Well, l was kind of hopin'...

957
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:23,518
that you might find something
that you enjoy doin'.

958
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:26,234
Something useful in our world.

959
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:28,954
- Your world?
- lntelligence.

960
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:33,198
Ah, no, no, no, no.
lt's home for me, Jack.

961
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,754
l'm jumpin' out
of my skin here.

962
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:39,156
l mean, l want my life.
l want my life.

963
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,872
- What do you want?
- lt's not what l want.

964
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,594
What do they want?

965
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:52,918
They want to feel safe.
They don't feel safe with you out there.

966
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:58,194
W-W-W-Why would they? They've having me
break codes all night. Secret codes.

967
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:01,710
l mean, there-- l shouldn't be listening
to a code from Britain to Saudi Arabia.

968
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:05,389
l mean, these are our allies. lf-if you
guys are gonna accuse me of a crime...

969
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,910
or keep me here, l'll tell the press.

970
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:12,157
Or l'll call London or Riyadh.

971
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:15,272
l know all the, uh,
capitals now, by the way.

972
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,868
You can test me.

973
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:22,198
My interest in Mr Malley has
to do with seismology and geology.

974
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,993
lt has nothing to do
with security issues.

975
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:26,838
Oh, l know,
but that's not the point.

976
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:31,795
Mr Malley has been released
without charges, but he is
considered a security risk.

977
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,354
l'll be frank with you.
He's an unknown quantity.

978
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,392
And we'd feel better
for the time being...

979
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,636
if he wasn't granted
any access to the institutions...

980
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,035
where sensitive government projects
are in the works.

981
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:45,391
- Access?
- Access even to personnel.

982
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,557
- Lace?
- Ohh.

983
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,398
lt's-- lt's me.

984
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,272
- Hi.
- Hi.
- l'm sorry l didn't--

985
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,960
l didn't come through the front door,
but l was so afraid l'd wake the kids.

986
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,230
Oh, that's okay, that's okay.

987
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,396
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

988
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,909
l wanted to see ya.

989
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:17,476
Nate told me about the FBl.
l'm so glad they let you go.

990
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:22,196
Yeah, well, they had no choice, but
they, they are watching me so closely.

991
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:24,117
l think l scare them.

992
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:30,352
You scare me too.

993
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:33,552
l do? Hmm.

994
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:41,155
Listen, George, this is
getting really complicated.

995
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:44,556
l just, uh-- l just don't know
what's going to happen next.

996
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,474
l should probably
leave you alone, shouldn't l?

997
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,913
l guess so.

998
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:09,553
l'll see ya.

999
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,074
Bye.

1000
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:28,114
Hey.

1001
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:30,515
- You want a beer, George?
- Yep.

1002
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:35,277
Look, Nate--

1003
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:38,551
l am really sorry
for what happened, okay?

1004
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:41,877
l told them everything, George.

1005
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,719
l told them
everything about you.

1006
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:46,159
Everything.

1007
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:48,748
Well, you know, that's
supposed to happen, okay?

1008
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:51,952
- l mean, you know, it's, uh--
- You just think you're
not going to be so scared,

1009
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:56,073
and you're sittin' there--
you don't know what's gonna happen,
then all of a sudden...

1010
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,839
somethin' happens inside you, right?

1011
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,871
And you don't know what it is, but--

1012
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,673
lt's all right.
l-l-lt was my game, you know?

1013
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,638
What'd they do to you, George?

1014
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:16,078
They tested me.

1015
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:18,475
What did they find out?

1016
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:24,711
- l'm pregnant. That's how it feels.
- How what feels?

1017
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:28,037
Yeah, you know, to be full of ideas
and you can't deliver, okay?

1018
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:30,913
l mean, you know, you're ready
to break out and you can't deliver.

1019
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:32,758
You know, uh, this professor,
he won't even talk to me.

1020
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,235
He won't even talk to me.

1021
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,828
- You're not going to Berkeley, George?
- Oh, come on. Me, at Berkeley?

1022
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:41,919
- That's a thought, huh?
- l'm sorry, buddy.

1023
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:43,837
You mean, inventions?
You got inventions?

1024
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:47,794
No, no. ldeas, okay? l get a thousand
ideas a day, every d-damn minute. Okay?

1025
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:52,118
l got big, big, ''holy cow''
kind of ideas and, and little
''what if'' ideas. All right?

1026
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:54,231
Hey, l got ideas for you, Jimmy.
Look at this.

1027
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:56,157
Look at this. Your parking lot--
it's laid out all wrong, okay?

1028
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:58,191
Now, if you just
follow this, right,

1029
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:01,357
you can put six more cars in and
nobody gets fender benders. All right?

1030
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:05,712
Where's Paulette?
Where is she? Bonnie, here. Take this.
This is a new route for our mail. Okay?

1031
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,831
Now, if she does this,
she can save an hour a day...

1032
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:10,315
and everybody gets their mail
by 3:00. lmagine, 3:00.

1033
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,954
Oh, and l got a ''holy shit'' idea too.
Look at this.

1034
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:16,311
Now this may be the most efficient way
to store solar energy. Okay? Take it.

1035
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:19,955
- Well, what am l gonna do with it?
- What the hell am l supposed
to do with it, huh?

1036
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:22,036
You know what that light was?
You know what that sound was?

1037
01:11:22,160 --> 01:11:23,912
-Tell us.
-l'm gonna tell you what it was.
-Well, tell us!

1038
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:26,349
- lt was a damn alien.
- Don't say that.
You don't know what it was.

1039
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:28,869
- l know what it is, Nate.
- You don't know what it was.
Don't say that.

1040
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,355
- Well, tell us!
- lt's a goddam mistake,
is what it is!

1041
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:36,395
Okay? lt was supposed
to happen to someone smart, someone
scientific, someone who's a leader.

1042
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:38,988
But it didn't. lt happened
to me, George freakin' Malley.

1043
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:41,236
Look at him. Now look at him. Look!

1044
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:48,629
Jimmy?

1045
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:52,511
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1046
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,868
- l'm sorry.
- No, it's all right.

1047
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,595
- l-l-l'll pay for it.
- All right.

1048
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:04,599
Bonnie. Bonnie, please.
l-l-lt's ok--

1049
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:07,388
Oh, man.

1050
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:21,913
Mm-hmm.

1051
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:23,439
Okay.

1052
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:25,312
Who was that? Customer?

1053
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:30,717
lt's Banes.
Says he can't work here no more.

1054
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:32,990
Sorry.

1055
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,315
Why didn't he talk to me?

1056
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,431
- A little bit scared, l guess.
- Jesus Christ.

1057
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:40,074
Look, George, it'll wear off.

1058
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:42,714
They'll forget.
Their cars are gonna break down--

1059
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,592
- Hi.
- Hey, Doc.

1060
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:45,948
Hi.

1061
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,071
- Energy vibrations. What is it?
- l don't know.

1062
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,873
- T-- Telekinesis? What? What?
- Yeah, maybe. Uh, maybe, yeah.

1063
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,228
You think it's gettin' out of hand?

1064
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:56,952
Well, look, you know,
l was, l was mad, all right?

1065
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:59,116
l was pissed off,
and l'm not mad now, okay?

1066
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:03,199
Good. l'll sound the all-clear,
call off the paratroopers.

1067
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:06,039
Jesus, George. Now, listen.

1068
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:09,118
- You owe me a CAT scan.
l want more blood.
- Mm-hmm.

1069
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:12,277
- Also, you look like hell.
- Ah, that's good.

1070
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,197
Doc, what's the matter
with everybody?

1071
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,072
They won't give me a chance
to explain anything.

1072
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,474
l look at them--
l look at them, and they--

1073
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,160
they look at me like
l'm a green bug or something.

1074
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,396
- Give them some time, George.
- Now, look, l have an idea.

1075
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,317
Now, you look at this.
Now, look at this.

1076
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:27,512
Now, now, look at that. Now, l-l-l'm
a big deal at the Harmon Library.

1077
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:30,359
l can, l can take up to 30 books
a night, okay, and l told them
l'd be part of this.

1078
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:32,436
l said that l-l-l would put out
a table and...

1079
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,516
- Your pressure is way up now.
- and l would sit there and
people could ask me questions.

1080
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,756
You know, meet George Malley.
What do you think?

1081
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,677
Uh, like a circus attraction.

1082
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:40,233
Oh, God, Doc, please.

1083
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:42,032
- Yeah.
- You know, l, uh--

1084
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:44,071
You see, l c-c-can explain
to them once and for all.

1085
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,872
l-l could share
my ideas with them,

1086
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,797
you know, and then l-l-l
could get my life back together.

1087
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,832
Come see me for that scan.
Take it easy on sugar and salt.

1088
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:55,636
Okay? And do like l told you all your
life. Breathe in and out. Okay, George?

1089
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,637
Yeah.

1090
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,551
- Come on. Give it!
- No.

1091
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:22,319
- Give it. Come on!
- No!
- You're not careful. You'll break it.

1092
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,715
- Al, what do ya got there?
- Please, l just wanna look at it.

1093
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:33,353
Hey. That's dangerous, sweetie.

1094
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:36,119
- He bought it.
- What?

1095
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,719
lt's a piece of
the mirror George broke.

1096
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,159
Richard Smick is
selling them at school.

1097
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,430
- Oh, you're kidding.
- lt's hot! Feel it.

1098
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,437
lt's not hot.

1099
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:46,518
Richard said the aliens probably
took George Malley away...

1100
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:48,995
and put this man in his place.

1101
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,918
- This man?
- Like he's not human.

1102
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:54,429
That's really dumb,
and it's really mean.

1103
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:00,997
Can't they just look in his eyes
and see who he is? Can't you?

1104
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:04,669
Do you remember, when daddy left,
how people treated us differently?

1105
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,268
Even our so-called friends.

1106
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:12,152
Remember how much it hurt?
You don't do that to people.

1107
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,079
How much you pay for that?

1108
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:20,670
- A quarter.
- A dollar.
- What's the truth, Al?

1109
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:25,112
l paid a dollar.
l was gonna check it with my magnets.

1110
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:26,355
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1111
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,994
Do you see something
really strange in there?

1112
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:31,031
- What?
- What?

1113
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:32,912
A sucker.

1114
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,075
- No.
- You paid a dollar for nothing.

1115
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,316
- You're a goner.
- Nice job, Al.

1116
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:00,439
Hmm.

1117
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,953
Lace.

1118
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,354
Hi.

1119
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,114
Hi.

1120
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:15,912
l just-- l just called you.

1121
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:19,999
- You did?
- Mmm. Come in, come in.

1122
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:29,034
l'm so, so glad you came.

1123
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:31,151
Well, l was just--

1124
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,874
W-Why-- Why were you calling?

1125
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,753
l found some things out, Lace.

1126
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:39,872
Things, uh, are coming clearer to me.

1127
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,719
Or, at least,
they're, they're starting to.

1128
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:45,559
- Things?
- Mmm.

1129
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:47,796
l wanna talk to the people, Lace.

1130
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,036
l-l don't want them to be scared of me
or, or frightened.

1131
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:54,995
l-- l mean, l wanna,
l wanna tell them what l know.

1132
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,839
So l've, l've decided
to speak at the library fair.

1133
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:02,233
Do-- Do you think that
they'll listen to me?

1134
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:07,477
What would they do, throw stones?

1135
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:12,678
Oh, my God, please sit down.
l can't believe this.

1136
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,030
Would you like something
to drink? A beer.

1137
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:18,072
- No.
- What? What can l get you?

1138
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:22,312
Scissors.

1139
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:25,637
l can hear her heart beat

1140
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:29,548
From a thousand miles

1141
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:35,630
And the heavens open up
every time she smiles

1142
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:43,195
And when l come to her
that is where l belong

1143
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:50,032
And l'm runnin' through her
like a river song

1144
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:56,872
She gives me love, love
love, love, crazy love

1145
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:03,314
She gives me love, love
love, love, crazy love

1146
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:11,792
She's got a fine sense of humour
when l'm feelin' low down

1147
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:16,869
And l'm comin' to her
when the sun goes down

1148
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:25,631
Take away my troubles
Oh, take away my grief

1149
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:31,471
Take away my heartaches
in the night like a thief

1150
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:38,472
She gives me love, love
love, love, crazy love

1151
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:46,678
She gives me love, love
love, love, crazy love

1152
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:51,157
And l need her in the daytime

1153
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:54,033
l need her

1154
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:58,039
And l need her in the night

1155
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:00,435
l need her

1156
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:05,759
And l wanna throw
my arms around her

1157
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:08,110
- Have you done this before?
- And kiss and hug her
- Nope.

1158
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:11,755
- Hmm.
- And kiss and hug her tight

1159
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:21,354
- Up or down.
- When l'm returning
- Down.

1160
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:24,313
From so far away

1161
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:27,716
Give me some sweet lovin'

1162
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:31,719
lt brightens up my day

1163
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,308
And it makes me righteous

1164
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:37,955
And it makes me whole

1165
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:44,394
And it makes me mellow
right down to my soul

1166
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:51,312
She gives me love, love
love, love, crazy love

1167
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:58,755
She gives me love, love
love, love, crazy love

1168
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,235
ls it close enough?

1169
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:03,788
You tell me.

1170
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:09,394
You give me love
Give me love

1171
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:12,432
- Crazy love
- Uh, it's pretty close.

1172
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:19,193
Love, love, love,
love, crazy love

1173
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:25,395
You give me love, love
love, love, crazy love

1174
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:31,071
You're running away?

1175
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:36,318
Are you comin' back?

1176
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:43,629
Hmm.

1177
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,238
Hope so.

1178
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:17,872
- Okay, George?
- Huh-huh.

1179
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,036
Oh, hi, Doc.

1180
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:32,072
- Welcome.
- Do you improve your mind
with all this reading?

1181
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:33,997
Yes, Doc.

1182
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:36,076
Lady Chatterly's Lover?

1183
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:41,232
Yeah, well-- All right, well,
you know, that's kind of, uh--

1184
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:44,272
that's kind of a code book for anyone
who, uh, wants to understand...

1185
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:46,197
a woman's heart and mind.

1186
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:50,199
- l read it twice.
- Ah, George, can you, uh--

1187
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:53,392
can you name the presidents
forwards and backwards for these people?

1188
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:56,910
No, but l can name some, uh, forward
presidents and some backward ones.

1189
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,554
You know, l-l can really only tell you
what l've read in these books and, uh--

1190
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:06,276
- He looks better.
- Yeah, yeah he does.
- you know, things l'm thinking about.

1191
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:09,153
l seem to have an increased capacity
for, for learning right now.

1192
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:13,876
- How do we know
you read all these books?
- Well, um, ask me something.

1193
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,390
Uh, l'd be, l'll be glad to answer
any question that you have, or a--

1194
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:21,991
How did you break that mirror, George,
without even touching it?

1195
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:24,270
Now, l wanna talk
to you about that, Banes,

1196
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:27,915
because l know, l know
you've been worried about it, and, um--

1197
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:30,759
Okay, come here. Come here.
Everybody gather closely.

1198
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,757
l'm gonna-- May l use your glasses?

1199
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:36,998
What you're about to see
is not a trick.

1200
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:40,635
Okay? lt-- lt's just, um--
Well l-l-let's call it
an experiment in energy.

1201
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:42,637
- Oh!
- Cool.

1202
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:44,432
- Well, everything there is...
- Are you getting this?

1203
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,869
is made up of
some living energy, okay?

1204
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,596
See, now, all this is is a-- is kind
of a dance, or a partnership between...

1205
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:55,315
the energy coming from me
and the, uh, energy of the plastic.

1206
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:58,352
- Now, now, tha-tha-that's it, see.
- Well, why can't we do it?

1207
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:02,951
Well, focus, um, the clarity
of thought. l-l don't know.

1208
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:04,308
M-May-Maybe you can, Banes.

1209
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:06,271
What about the UFOs?
What are they?

1210
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:09,949
- l don't know that either.
- Yes, you do. Yes, you do!

1211
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:13,993
Um, this power began the night
that you saw the object in the sky?

1212
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,348
T-T-That was a light.

1213
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:17,471
Now, now, let me, let me
just finish this one thing.

1214
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,591
Now, now, we were talking
about a partnership.

1215
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:24,430
Now, do you, do you know what the
largest living organism in the world is?

1216
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:28,792
Okay, it's a-- it's a grove of aspen
trees in Colorado. Acres of aspens.

1217
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:31,309
Okay, now, they thought
they were disconnected, separate,

1218
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,078
but indeed they found out
that they weren't,

1219
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:36,556
that, that there was one giant organism
with the same root system.

1220
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:39,592
What sort of light was it?

1221
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:41,870
- Now, that-that's not unlike us.
- Answer the question!

1222
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,116
- We, we think that we're disconnected,
- Why won't you tell us what
you know about the UFOs?

1223
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:46,993
- Can you move a table?
- but, you know, we're--
- How did you feel
when you saw that light?

1224
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:50,237
- l think you know more
than you're telling us.
- We're not. Now imagine--
imagine, if you will--

1225
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:53,511
Have you seen the light since
the 28th, or any other activity?

1226
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:56,108
- Are you hiding something?
- Hey, hey. Hey, come on!

1227
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:58,515
- Just put your hands on my boy.
- lt was aliens. Admit it!

1228
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:00,710
- Move the glasses some more.
- Can you bend spoons?

1229
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:02,990
- Now, we all know what you can do.
- Hey, leave George alone.

1230
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:06,999
- Why won't you touch the boy?
- Please, he's dying. Just do it.

1231
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:08,712
George! George!

1232
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:17,956
George? George, can you see me?

1233
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:20,719
George. George, are you okay?

1234
01:25:35,720 --> 01:25:37,676
Mr Malley? Are you all right?

1235
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:14,669
- You look sorrowful.
- No.

1236
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:18,713
What's the matter? Can't think
of any more tests to give me?

1237
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:22,674
How did you, uh, manage to get
your pressure to come down?

1238
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,519
Oh, l found my pace.

1239
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:27,437
A simple thing, really.

1240
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:30,836
- Hard to explain.
- What, you figure l'm too thick?

1241
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:33,554
What l figure about you...

1242
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:36,319
is that you're stalling.

1243
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:40,399
l'm not stalling, no.
l'm-l'm waiting.

1244
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:43,876
- For what?
- Reinforcements.

1245
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:55,039
Well, you pick good people.

1246
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:56,912
You bet.

1247
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:02,032
See--

1248
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:04,998
George. George.

1249
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:10,317
There's a tumor in your brain...

1250
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:12,317
that's spread out like a hand.

1251
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:14,510
Threads of it, you know, everywhere.

1252
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:17,518
But instead of dysfunction--
Now, here's the mystery, George.

1253
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:21,519
lnstead of destroying
brain function,

1254
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:25,997
so far it's been stimulating it,
and we can't understand that.

1255
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:30,671
You have more area of active brain use
than anybody ever tested, ever,

1256
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,916
b-because of those tentacles.

1257
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:34,837
l mean, we've seen tumors
like this before.

1258
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:42,548
lt's called astrocytoma, and
it explains, uh, the dizziness and...

1259
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:45,069
the illusion of light.

1260
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:48,431
But the way it's in there,
waking up areas of the brain,

1261
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:50,278
it's a...

1262
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:55,440
big mystery, so--

1263
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:58,756
And it's killing me.

1264
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,199
- Well, uh--
- For sure?

1265
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,197
We got a call from
the best brain man in the country.

1266
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:08,595
l mean, actually,
he's one of the best in the world.

1267
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:12,429
- He's gonna study your tests
and then talk to you.
- Hmm.

1268
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:16,917
But, uh, the blood flow
is in danger now,

1269
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:19,873
and, uh, you're gonna
start to weaken, maybe...

1270
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:24,114
black out.

1271
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:29,792
We, we really don't know. lt's, it's--
But it's a damn lousy scenario, you see.

1272
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:36,913
Let me sit down here a minute.

1273
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,636
Goddam it.

1274
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,311
Something happened
about 25 years ago...

1275
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:49,874
when you broke your leg
and l set it, George.

1276
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,673
l don't know what to call it,
but, uh,

1277
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:57,112
somehow you got into
my heart more than most,

1278
01:28:57,240 --> 01:28:58,992
and for--

1279
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:04,875
and for a man
who's never been a father,

1280
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,991
l sure feel like
l'm losin' a son.

1281
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:10,192
Yeah.

1282
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:14,475
Georgie.

1283
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:15,953
Yeah.

1284
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:24,796
Can l do something for you,
George? Anything?

1285
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:30,040
Yes. Next spring,
when you plant the south 40,

1286
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:32,958
l want you to use
the new fertilizer.

1287
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:35,310
- l want you to put corn in that field,
and l know what you're thinking--
- l can't put corn in there.

1288
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:38,750
You're thinking that
it's too tough a crop, but it's not.

1289
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:42,998
l'm telling you. You'll get
four to five years without rotation.

1290
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:45,111
Now, trust me on this.

1291
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:46,992
Hey.

1292
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:52,436
- l'm gonna wait outside.
- Okay.

1293
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:54,710
Doc, you wanna come with me?

1294
01:29:54,840 --> 01:29:56,592
Yeah.

1295
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:01,232
Bye, Doc.

1296
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:14,510
Now, uh, he didn't say how long.

1297
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:22,398
Days or weeks.
They don't-- They don't know.

1298
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:25,278
l'm so sorry, Lace.

1299
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:30,232
l know how you hate surprises.

1300
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:34,234
l tried so hard not to love you.

1301
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:36,237
- How'd you make out?
- Terrible.

1302
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:44,832
Hey, would you, uh,
love me the rest of my life?

1303
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:48,748
No, l'm gonna love you
for the rest of mine.

1304
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:15,836
George Malley?
l'm Dr Wellin.

1305
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:19,158
George, l'm recording this because...

1306
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:23,068
l'm going to be asking you
some very important questions.

1307
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:25,873
- You ready?
- Not another test?

1308
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,037
No. No, no. No more tests.

1309
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,789
A dialogue.

1310
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:37,755
l'm going to ask for your permission for
my team to perform open brain surgery.

1311
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:41,475
But l don't want you to answer
'til we've had our dialogue, all right?

1312
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:44,194
Bu-But you s-s-said that
this tumor was inoperable.

1313
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:48,472
l think the odds are very small,
say one in five hundred,

1314
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:51,751
that we'd be able to remove enough
of the tumor to even prolong your life.

1315
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:54,997
- Well, why, why--
- But, but what l want to explain is...

1316
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:59,318
that this would not be
a lifesaving operation.

1317
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:01,192
This would be--

1318
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:04,351
Call it an expedition.

1319
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:09,555
This would be
a voyage of discovery.

1320
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:12,672
You're in a position to contribute
as much to our knowledge...

1321
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:15,109
as any man or woman
who's come before you.

1322
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:19,791
And if you were
to wait, and, uh,

1323
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:23,356
do this operation after l'm done
with my brain, what, what would, uh--

1324
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:27,234
lf that's what you want,
yes, an autopsy, that's all we'll do.

1325
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:28,634
But it wouldn't be as useful?

1326
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:33,072
The study of a living,
active brain would tell us volumes.

1327
01:32:33,200 --> 01:32:34,599
All right, so if you were
to do this operation,

1328
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:37,951
wouldn't it most likely kill me
or at least shorten my life?

1329
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:43,473
-George, l-l'm asking you to try
and see the larger picture.
-Mm-hmm.

1330
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:48,435
To realize what you have to offer to us,
the ones you're leaving behind.

1331
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:52,951
You could be
our greatest teacher, George. Hmm?

1332
01:32:53,080 --> 01:32:56,516
l can be your biographer,
in a sense.

1333
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:59,200
l can present you to the world.

1334
01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:03,518
But that's not me.
That's just my brain. Do you understand?

1335
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:07,713
Look, Doctor, you know,
l just might have something
to say in my last few hours.

1336
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:10,274
l-l just might have
something to say.

1337
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:12,960
What you're saying is that
l have something to teach,

1338
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:16,356
and yet you're willing to end me
to study my brain under a microscope.

1339
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:18,550
- N-Now, is that all l'm here for?
- What else?

1340
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:20,671
- You're not a scholar or a think--
- l-l-l'll tell you what l am, okay?

1341
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,279
l'll tell you what l think l am.

1342
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:23,719
l think l'm what everybody can be.

1343
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,558
Everyone with
a malignant, tentacled--

1344
01:33:25,680 --> 01:33:29,832
No, no, no, no. lt's-- lt's--
Tha-tha-that just helped me
get here, okay?

1345
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:31,234
l mean, anybody can get here.

1346
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:35,990
lt's-- l'm-- l'm
the possibility, all right?

1347
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:38,759
l mean, l think you've got this
desperate grasp on, uh, technology...

1348
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:42,953
and this grasp on science, and,
uh, you don't have a-a hand left
to grasp what's important.

1349
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:44,877
- George. Now, George--
- lf l had to choose between
a tumor that got me here...

1350
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,276
and some flash of light from
an alien craft, l'd choose the tumor.

1351
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:50,516
l would, because
it's here, within us.

1352
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:53,154
What l'm talking about
is the human spirit.

1353
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:57,796
That's the challenge. That's the voyage.
That's the expedition.

1354
01:34:01,240 --> 01:34:03,595
You need to go now.

1355
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:07,759
l need my rest,
and, uh, l wanna go home.

1356
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:29,756
Hey, hey, hey. l tried to release
my patient. Now, what's going on?

1357
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:31,233
- lt's done
- What's done?
- We didn't feel...

1358
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:33,669
George Malley was
competent to make the decision.

1359
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:35,597
He's a surgical patient now.

1360
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:38,075
Oh, what did you tell the judge?
That you could save him?

1361
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:40,111
l might prolong his life, yes.

1362
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:41,468
Bullshit.

1363
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:43,556
lf he were rational, he'd say yes.

1364
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:45,272
You know he would.

1365
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:47,436
Now l know why you guys wear masks.

1366
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:55,509
Yeah, if it was light enough,
he could've been blowing
on it with his breath.

1367
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:57,358
You know, he could
have had a string.

1368
01:34:57,480 --> 01:35:00,756
So thin, you know, like, uh, catgut.

1369
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:03,872
l mean, he could've had it
on his finger and on the glasses
and he could have made it move that way.

1370
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:07,834
Don't you think he, he could've
uh, thrown s-somethin'
at that mirror somehow?

1371
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:10,110
- We-We just didn't see it?
- No way.

1372
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:12,435
That quake could've
been a coincidence.

1373
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:16,109
He just thought he knew stuff.
l mean s-s-- he just studied
harder on the Spanish.

1374
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:18,549
That's all. lt's not like
he really knew stuff.

1375
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:22,355
Just studied hard at chess
and made us think he was changin', but--

1376
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:24,232
You know, he never
really changed at all.

1377
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:25,839
Ain't that right, Doc?

1378
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:29,111
l mean, he never
really got any smarter.

1379
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:30,593
Doc?

1380
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:32,756
Banes?

1381
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:35,273
How's your lady love?

1382
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:39,629
We, uh, we broke up.

1383
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:42,832
Oh, really? That's too bad.

1384
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:46,953
Yeah. Now, George, he's got a love at
his side, and she's stickin' with him.

1385
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:50,629
You know why?
Because he bought her chairs.

1386
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:53,718
That's pretty smart to me.

1387
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:56,354
You ever buy Lisa's chairs?

1388
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:59,119
God, Doc's really drunk tonight. God.

1389
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:05,110
Every woman has her chairs, something
she needs to put herself into, Banes.

1390
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:08,357
You ever figure out what
Lisa's chairs were and buy 'em?

1391
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:13,159
Nope.

1392
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:14,793
But you're right about one thing.

1393
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:18,913
George never changed.
Never. No, never.

1394
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:24,516
Doc's makin' no sense tonight.

1395
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:26,596
Yeah. Maybe he
caught it from George.

1396
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:31,350
- Now, goddam it, Doc!
- Why do you have to tear him down?

1397
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:33,914
What are you so afraid of?
What have you got to lose?

1398
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:37,112
He wasn't selling anything.
He didn't want anything from anybody!

1399
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:41,358
He wanted nothing from nobody.
Nothing! Nothing!

1400
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:48,430
And you people have to tear him down
so you can sleep better tonight?

1401
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:53,509
So you can prove that the world is flat
and sleep better tonight. Am l right?

1402
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:01,959
l'm right.

1403
01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:09,315
To hell with all of you.
To hell with every one of you.

1404
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:22,632
Hey, George. How ya doin'?
There ya go.

1405
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:24,352
- Drink up.
- All right.

1406
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:30,674
Good job.

1407
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:34,190
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't take
the pudding. That's the good part.

1408
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:35,389
Hey, is Cal around?

1409
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:36,919
Sure. You wanna see him?

1410
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:39,235
- Yeah, thanks.
- Okay.

1411
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:05,829
- Hey, dude.
- Hey, man.

1412
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:06,949
- How's it goin'?
- All right.

1413
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:08,274
Can you stay for a few minutes?

1414
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:10,118
Sure.

1415
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:12,959
- Saved you some pudding again.
- Oh, what a buddy.

1416
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:14,798
l love this stuff.

1417
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:21,708
Night, dude.

1418
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,957
Hey, Doc. You seen him?

1419
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:39,513
- Seen who? What?
- George Malley. He's out.

1420
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:41,949
He sneaked out.
We're lookin' all over for him.

1421
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:44,036
- He's out?
- Yeah, he flew the coop.

1422
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:46,276
Nobody knows where he is.
l heard it on the radio.

1423
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:49,551
Flew the coop. Those FBl guys are
gonna have me drivin' around all night.

1424
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:50,999
lf l gonna be home late again--

1425
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:02,274
l want you to take these
and give them to Doc.

1426
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:05,119
These l'm taking with me
because l haven't finished them yet.

1427
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:06,958
They're for Doctor Ringold.

1428
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:09,715
This l wrote for you, Nate.

1429
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:11,796
lt's-- lt's about soils, and, uh,

1430
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:13,478
some of my own thoughts.

1431
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:15,318
- Your thoughts?
- Yeah.

1432
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:19,872
- l could drive you, George.
- No. No, Nate, it's too chancy.

1433
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,831
You can make it, man.

1434
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:25,678
- Nate.
- George.

1435
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:52,359
L.

1436
01:39:56,640 --> 01:39:58,392
Oh.

1437
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:00,795
Oh.

1438
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:15,313
l'll get it.

1439
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:17,158
Now you put the top on it.

1440
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:20,153
Attaboy.

1441
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:25,996
- Leave me alone.
- Do it, Al.

1442
01:40:31,480 --> 01:40:32,708
That tight enough?

1443
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:35,035
Why don't you do it once more?

1444
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:38,393
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

1445
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:45,995
There you go.

1446
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:48,156
Good. Now you fixed it.

1447
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:54,794
What?

1448
01:40:57,080 --> 01:41:00,072
You came here to die, didn't you?

1449
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:09,278
But l'm-- l like this place,
and, um, l love the people here.

1450
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:41,552
You know, if, if we were to,
uh, to put this apple down...

1451
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:46,549
and leave it, it would be spoiled
and gone within a few days.

1452
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:51,708
But if we were to take
a bite of it like this,

1453
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:54,559
it would become part of us,

1454
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:56,557
and we could take it with us forever.

1455
01:42:16,280 --> 01:42:19,909
Al-- Everything...

1456
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:24,079
is on its way to somewhere.

1457
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:26,077
Everything.

1458
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:46,917
That's a good bite.

1459
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:10,272
Keep an eye out.

1460
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:22,438
Have you seen George Malley,
Miss Pennamin?

1461
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:24,073
What's the point?

1462
01:43:26,240 --> 01:43:28,515
Look, it's not my call.

1463
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:32,840
l haven't seen him.

1464
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:54,394
- You mind if l get in your truck?
- Why?

1465
01:44:08,040 --> 01:44:09,632
What's your first name?

1466
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:14,757
Jack.

1467
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:17,269
How would you want to die, Jack?

1468
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,639
Come on. Let's go.

1469
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:46,432
There you are.

1470
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:50,629
l knew l'd find you here.

1471
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:55,510
What are you working on?

1472
01:44:55,640 --> 01:45:00,191
Doctor Ringold's coming tomorrow,
and l just wanted to finish this up.

1473
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:04,199
- Finish what?
- Ah, just some possibilities.

1474
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:07,072
Hey, come sit by me.

1475
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:10,555
Hmm?

1476
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:13,473
You scared?

1477
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:16,797
No.

1478
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:18,751
l wish l knew what you feel.

1479
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:23,670
Oh, you do.
You've always known it, Lace.

1480
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:28,078
l'll show you. When your children
were babies, how did you hold them?

1481
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:35,478
And if they had
a hard time sleeping,

1482
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:38,478
and you had to rock them to sleep,
well, how did you do it?

1483
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:01,632
See?

1484
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:08,072
Hey, look what l made back there.

1485
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,833
That looks like a bed.

1486
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:14,791
Are you expecting to get lucky?

1487
01:46:14,920 --> 01:46:18,071
No, just hoping.

1488
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:30,274
When the road gets dark

1489
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:36,474
You can no longer see

1490
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:43,071
Just let my love
throw a spark, baby

1491
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:49,198
And have a little faith in me

1492
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:55,716
And when the tears you cry

1493
01:46:57,520 --> 01:47:01,593
Are all you can believe

1494
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:07,750
Just give these lovin' arms a try, baby

1495
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:13,638
And have a little faith in me

1496
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:19,073
Have a little faith in me

1497
01:47:20,240 --> 01:47:24,677
Have a little faith in me

1498
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:31,109
Have a little faith in me

1499
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:36,671
Have a little faith in me

1500
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:50,757
- Hey, l never kissed you there.
- Hmm, no.

1501
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:53,440
- Keeping track?
- Mm-hmm.

1502
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:00,557
You going to sleep?

1503
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:03,592
Mm-hmm. Are you?

1504
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:08,271
No. l don't want to sleep
unless you're sleeping,

1505
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:10,391
and l don't wanna--

1506
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:19,154

1507
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:21,350
- Sweetheart.
- What?

1508
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:28,512
- Honey, you have to listen to me now.
- What?

1509
01:48:34,160 --> 01:48:37,470
- lt's happening.
- No.
- Mm-hmm.

1510
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:42,151
No. Wait, George, wait.

1511
01:48:42,280 --> 01:48:44,748
- No.
- And it's gonna be okay.

1512
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:49,959
- George--
- lt's okay.

1513
01:48:50,080 --> 01:48:51,798
lt's gonna be okay.

1514
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:55,034
Okay.

1515
01:48:57,760 --> 01:48:59,318
Goodbye, honey.

1516
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:02,511
No.

1517
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:16,993

To dance with life

Full moon shall wake you
