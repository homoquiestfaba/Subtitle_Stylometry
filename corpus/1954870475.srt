1
00:00:34,653 --> 00:00:36,554
Hurry up.

2
00:00:36,555 --> 00:00:38,722
It's floored. I'm going
as fast as I can.

3
00:00:38,723 --> 00:00:40,892
You've got to go faster, man!

4
00:00:49,234 --> 00:00:51,403
It's not slowing down.

5
00:00:51,404 --> 00:00:53,404
<i>I know.</i>

6
00:00:53,405 --> 00:00:57,208
<i>Go! Come on!</i>

7
00:00:57,209 --> 00:00:58,809
Faster!

8
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,912
We're running out of lake.

9
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,035
<i>Faster!</i>

10
00:01:06,036 --> 00:01:07,485
Come on!

11
00:01:07,486 --> 00:01:11,157
<i>We're going to have to beach
it. Get ready to jump!</i>

12
00:01:12,825 --> 00:01:14,926
<i>We're not going to make it!</i>

13
00:01:14,927 --> 00:01:17,737
ICETASTROPHE

14
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:45,790
<i>Jingle bells,
your breath smells</i>

15
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:47,791
<i>Why don't you Leave work?</i>

16
00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:49,728
<i>If you keep staring
at your screen</i>

17
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:52,197
<i># You'll turn into a jerk #</i>

18
00:01:54,033 --> 00:01:55,032
Very funny.

19
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:57,002
Thank you.

20
00:01:57,003 --> 00:01:58,903
So did you sleep here
last night or...

21
00:01:58,904 --> 00:02:02,474
No.

22
00:02:02,475 --> 00:02:04,475
You were wearing this yesterday.

23
00:02:04,476 --> 00:02:06,577
Yeah, okay. Look at this.
This is something.

24
00:02:06,578 --> 00:02:07,774
I'm telling you, check that out.

25
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:10,314
Yes, it is an asteroid.

26
00:02:10,315 --> 00:02:12,984
We've been tracking that for weeks.
It's the size of this desk.

27
00:02:12,985 --> 00:02:15,487
It's not going to survive the
burn up through our atmosphere

28
00:02:15,488 --> 00:02:17,689
just like hundreds of
millions before it.

29
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,358
Yeah, but this flaring right here,
that's a temperature shift.

30
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:21,444
How do you explain that?

31
00:02:21,445 --> 00:02:22,494
It's Santa's sleigh.

32
00:02:22,495 --> 00:02:24,149
<i>My God, that is Santa's sleigh.</i>

33
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,200
You discovered Santa's sleigh.

34
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:28,299
I'm serious, Neil,
this is not normal.

35
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,701
Neither is
working over Christmas.

36
00:02:29,702 --> 00:02:32,304
Come on, let's go.

37
00:02:32,305 --> 00:02:35,306
Can't I stay? I mean, my
parents are in Hong Kong.

38
00:02:35,307 --> 00:02:37,441
I'm going to my aunt's tomorrow.
I hate my aunt.

39
00:02:37,442 --> 00:02:38,633
Just give me the keys
and I'll lock up.

40
00:02:38,634 --> 00:02:40,612
Alex, it's Christmas.

41
00:02:40,613 --> 00:02:42,647
You don't get
extra credit for staying.

42
00:02:42,648 --> 00:02:44,882
I'm not asking for it. I just
want more time with this.

43
00:02:44,883 --> 00:02:46,299
I just want to
see it through entry.

44
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,585
Okay, fine. Suit yourself.

45
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:50,788
But I'm telling you, it's going
to burn up into nothing.

46
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:52,691
You get a lump of
coal for Christmas.

47
00:02:52,692 --> 00:02:55,601
-Okay, a bah humbug to you.
-Unbelievable.

48
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:59,797
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

49
00:03:02,001 --> 00:03:07,038
What a dork.
Okay.

50
00:03:27,425 --> 00:03:30,494
What the hell?

51
00:03:31,663 --> 00:03:33,631
Yes!

52
00:03:33,632 --> 00:03:36,669
That worked out
pretty damn well, didn't it?

53
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:39,137
Hey, moron twins.

54
00:03:39,138 --> 00:03:40,804
What the hell are
you guys doing?

55
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:42,607
How many times have I told you

56
00:03:42,608 --> 00:03:44,909
that dynamite is
for avalanche control?

57
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,144
It's not a toy.

58
00:03:47,145 --> 00:03:48,780
Knuckleheads.

59
00:03:48,781 --> 00:03:51,649
I mean, he made me do it, so.

60
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,883
-Really?
-Yeah.

61
00:03:52,884 --> 00:03:54,685
Man...

62
00:03:54,686 --> 00:03:57,422
It's a holiday, all right?

63
00:03:57,423 --> 00:03:58,989
Look around, there's
nobody here,

64
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,558
TJ and I were just
having a bit of fun.

65
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:02,861
Really? Fun?
With dynamite?

66
00:04:02,862 --> 00:04:05,863
You keep playing with that stuff
you're going to take an arm off.

67
00:04:05,864 --> 00:04:07,899
Then what's your
mom going to say?

68
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,435
She'd probably just
blame you like she always does.

69
00:04:10,436 --> 00:04:12,904
Exactly. So, you
want to blow your arm off,

70
00:04:12,905 --> 00:04:14,773
then you do it on her
weekend, not mine.

71
00:04:14,774 --> 00:04:16,774
Sorry, Dad, we were
just a little bored.

72
00:04:16,775 --> 00:04:19,443
Really? Did you fix that lift
kit I told you to fix?

73
00:04:19,444 --> 00:04:22,579
Yes, I did it like
two hours ago.

74
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,917
All right, well, good.

75
00:04:27,652 --> 00:04:30,721
Mr. Ratchet, we were
hoping to go downtown,

76
00:04:30,722 --> 00:04:32,856
meet some friends, go to the,

77
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:33,975
you know, Christmas thing.

78
00:04:33,976 --> 00:04:35,058
Yeah, yeah. I know about it.

79
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:37,060
Forgive me if I don't
want to listen to Ben Crooge

80
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:39,197
spout off about what a damned
philanthropist he is.

81
00:04:39,198 --> 00:04:41,433
Everyone seems to think
that expanding the resort

82
00:04:41,434 --> 00:04:43,968
might bring more
business. Be good for the town.

83
00:04:43,969 --> 00:04:46,171
Son, everything comes at a cost.

84
00:04:46,172 --> 00:04:48,772
Ben doesn't seem to be
taking that into account these days.

85
00:04:48,773 --> 00:04:50,974
-Yet you still work for him.
-I do.

86
00:04:50,975 --> 00:04:53,577
It doesn't mean I blindly
support everything he does.

87
00:04:53,578 --> 00:04:55,647
This isn't right. Not this way.

88
00:04:55,648 --> 00:04:58,730
Hey, it is a Christmas
celebration.

89
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,084
I agree with this.

90
00:05:00,085 --> 00:05:01,886
-I could go for some celebration.
-I could celebrate.

91
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:04,688
You could celebrate, I could celebrate,
you could celebrate.

92
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:06,557
Enough.

93
00:05:07,492 --> 00:05:08,993
Then you got to
go to your mother's.

94
00:05:08,994 --> 00:05:11,696
Yeah, it is her year.

95
00:05:13,965 --> 00:05:16,634
Tell you what. I'll
give you a ride into town.

96
00:05:16,635 --> 00:05:18,804
I got to pick up some
supplies anyway.

97
00:05:19,504 --> 00:05:21,772
Nice.

98
00:05:21,773 --> 00:05:23,173
Kind father. He's a good man.

99
00:05:23,174 --> 00:05:25,511
-The best.
-Yeah.

100
00:05:37,722 --> 00:05:40,124
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

101
00:05:48,566 --> 00:05:51,569
<i>Merry Christmas, everybody!</i>

102
00:05:52,938 --> 00:05:57,876
<i>Merry Christmas, everyone!</i>

103
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:02,180
Happy Holidays!

104
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:05,283
Looks like Santa puked all
over the mayor's car.

105
00:06:05,284 --> 00:06:09,654
-What do you expect?
-Yeah. Pretty much that.

106
00:06:09,655 --> 00:06:11,556
See you around, Dad.

107
00:06:12,624 --> 00:06:15,626
This place is a circus,
once again.

108
00:06:17,796 --> 00:06:19,964
What she sees in you
I have no idea.

109
00:06:19,965 --> 00:06:23,073
-It must be my winning personality.
-Well, it's definitely not your looks.

110
00:06:23,074 --> 00:06:24,668
Very funny.

111
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:26,870
Hey, better watch
out for Mr. Crooge.

112
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:29,307
<i>He loves employees
chasing after his daughter, right?</i>

113
00:06:29,308 --> 00:06:31,308
Well, you see I don't
actually work for him.

114
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:35,312
-My dad does.
-I think that makes it worse.

115
00:06:35,313 --> 00:06:37,515
Probably. Yeah.

116
00:06:39,684 --> 00:06:41,952
See you around.

117
00:06:41,953 --> 00:06:44,688
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

118
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:47,258
Merry Christmas!

119
00:06:49,561 --> 00:06:51,796
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

120
00:06:51,797 --> 00:06:53,264
Saint Nick.

121
00:06:53,265 --> 00:06:55,567
Charlie, Merry Christmas!

122
00:06:55,568 --> 00:06:57,235
You're looking very jolly.

123
00:06:57,236 --> 00:06:59,002
I thought you
weren't coming in for this.

124
00:06:59,003 --> 00:07:02,173
Me? Well, I've got
a good excuse.

125
00:07:02,174 --> 00:07:04,808
<i>He's still signing my paychecks.</i>

126
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:08,211
-What are you doing?
-Celebrating the holidays.

127
00:07:08,212 --> 00:07:10,113
I see that.

128
00:07:10,114 --> 00:07:12,784
This fake snow is a nice touch.

129
00:07:12,785 --> 00:07:15,286
<i>Yeah. Global
warming is that way it is.</i>

130
00:07:15,287 --> 00:07:18,722
We'll be lucky if this town
ever sees a white Christmas again.

131
00:07:19,691 --> 00:07:23,627
-How are you holding up?
-Fake it till you make it, right?

132
00:07:23,628 --> 00:07:24,995
Don't worry about me, Charlie.

133
00:07:24,996 --> 00:07:27,197
I'll be okay.

134
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:31,035
He can take my store,
but he can't take my spirit.

135
00:07:36,975 --> 00:07:39,344
-Come on.
-We have to make this quick.

136
00:07:39,345 --> 00:07:41,681
If I miss my dad's thing,
he'll kill me.

137
00:07:41,682 --> 00:07:42,716
Okay.

138
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,918
And if he saw that,
he'd kill both of us.

139
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,288
Well, see, your father
is one thing,

140
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:52,757
that brother of yours, I
really think he's onto us.

141
00:07:52,758 --> 00:07:54,392
You're paranoid.

142
00:07:54,393 --> 00:07:57,696
Look, I don't want
to hide anymore, Marley.

143
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:02,868
I know.

144
00:08:07,672 --> 00:08:10,375
I wish things were different.

145
00:08:10,376 --> 00:08:13,211
Good to see you.

146
00:08:13,212 --> 00:08:16,813
Scott, where is that
sister of yours? We have to start.

147
00:08:16,814 --> 00:08:19,916
How should I know? Is it my turn
to put on her radio collar?

148
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,987
Maybe try giving her a call?

149
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:26,958
Do we have to do this now?

150
00:08:27,258 --> 00:08:29,793
No. No, we don't.

151
00:08:29,794 --> 00:08:33,857
But we do have to
do this right now.

152
00:08:33,858 --> 00:08:35,329
Merry Christmas, Marley.

153
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,700
But I didn't bring your present.

154
00:08:36,701 --> 00:08:38,769
That's okay, just open it.

155
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,840
And keep in mind I wanted
it to be bigger, obviously.

156
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,308
My God.

157
00:08:44,309 --> 00:08:45,843
It's a diamond.

158
00:08:45,844 --> 00:08:48,146
Barely, but you know,

159
00:08:48,147 --> 00:08:52,017
I saved up for it, so
I hope you like it.

160
00:08:56,422 --> 00:08:59,890
-Tim, I love it.
-Good.

161
00:09:03,394 --> 00:09:05,228
They're trying
to get a hold of me.

162
00:09:05,229 --> 00:09:08,232
Sure they are.

163
00:09:08,233 --> 00:09:12,771
Hey look, is
that a shooting star?

164
00:09:15,941 --> 00:09:18,376
<i>Hi, you've reached
Marley. Please leave me a message.</i>

165
00:09:18,377 --> 00:09:20,445
She's not answering.

166
00:09:20,446 --> 00:09:24,950
Well, forget it. We have
to do without her.

167
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:30,887
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

168
00:09:30,888 --> 00:09:32,790
<i>We are here today</i>

169
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:36,794
to break ground on a brand
new retail complex.

170
00:09:36,795 --> 00:09:38,329
<i>Now, in doing this,</i>

171
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,363
we should also say
our thank yous

172
00:09:40,364 --> 00:09:43,935
and our goodbyes to
all these stores around us.

173
00:09:43,936 --> 00:09:44,969
Yeah, right.

174
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:48,440
<i>We honor the role they've played
in our town's history.</i>

175
00:09:50,242 --> 00:09:53,276
<i>It's an exciting
time for our town.</i>

176
00:09:53,277 --> 00:09:57,415
<i>We've already begun
construction on Lakeview Mountain.</i>

177
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,146
<i>What is that?</i>

178
00:10:02,955 --> 00:10:03,909
My God.

179
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,055
Come on, we need to go.

180
00:10:05,056 --> 00:10:08,459
This marks a new beginning
for Lennox,

181
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,330
<i>finally bringing us into
the 21st century.</i>

182
00:10:13,132 --> 00:10:15,700
<i>Prosperity is coming to Lennox.</i>

183
00:10:17,902 --> 00:10:20,071
Everybody look out.

184
00:10:58,944 --> 00:11:01,012
<i>TJ.</i>

185
00:11:15,393 --> 00:11:17,295
Neil, it's me. It hit.

186
00:11:17,296 --> 00:11:19,564
In Lennox, 80 miles
northeast of Olympia.

187
00:11:19,565 --> 00:11:22,266
I'm heading there now.

188
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:25,537
If you get bored of singing
Christmas carols, you know where to find me.

189
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:42,087
Get on the phone
to Governor Michaels.

190
00:11:42,088 --> 00:11:43,122
Okay.

191
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:47,225
Crystal? Crystal, you okay?

192
00:11:53,231 --> 00:11:57,935
You guys, take your
mom to the bowling alley.

193
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:03,140
Are you okay? You sure?

194
00:12:03,141 --> 00:12:05,377
There's an
ambulance right there.

195
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,879
Miles. Miles, get up.

196
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,214
What the hell was that?

197
00:12:10,215 --> 00:12:12,349
I have no idea.

198
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,985
You good? Can you stand?
I need your help.

199
00:12:14,986 --> 00:12:17,054
There's a lot injured, we got
to get them out of here.

200
00:12:17,055 --> 00:12:19,357
-You up to it?
-Okay, yeah, go.

201
00:12:30,502 --> 00:12:35,006
-Is it on fire?
-No, it's freezing.

202
00:12:37,441 --> 00:12:39,510
Is he alive?

203
00:12:42,047 --> 00:12:44,081
I don't think so.

204
00:12:49,553 --> 00:12:52,123
What the...

205
00:12:52,124 --> 00:12:55,158
Ben! Help me.
My hands are stuck.

206
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:57,328
<i>What the...</i>

207
00:12:57,329 --> 00:12:59,263
Ben. Help me, please.

208
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:04,234
Ben! Please, help me!

209
00:13:19,584 --> 00:13:21,651
Miles!

210
00:13:21,652 --> 00:13:23,989
Miles.

211
00:13:29,594 --> 00:13:32,363
Tell the Governor this is way bigger
than anything we can handle.

212
00:13:32,364 --> 00:13:34,999
We need some help out here.

213
00:13:42,606 --> 00:13:45,075
Wait, wait, wait!

214
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,118
<i>Mom! Dad!</i>

215
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:55,071
<i>Marley.</i>

216
00:13:55,072 --> 00:13:55,987
Mom!

217
00:13:55,988 --> 00:13:58,023
<i>God.</i>

218
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,724
I'm so sorry!

219
00:13:59,725 --> 00:14:01,293
Scott, you seen my dad around?

220
00:14:01,294 --> 00:14:02,328
Yeah.

221
00:14:02,561 --> 00:14:04,462
Scott!

222
00:14:04,463 --> 00:14:07,198
Scott, what's wrong with you?

223
00:14:07,872 --> 00:14:09,951
Hey, enough. Enough.

224
00:14:09,952 --> 00:14:10,942
<i>What is going on?</i>

225
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,302
Why don't you ask your daughter?

226
00:14:12,303 --> 00:14:14,571
Enough.

227
00:14:14,572 --> 00:14:17,041
Now, folks, listen up.

228
00:14:17,042 --> 00:14:20,143
Listen, I just got off the phone
with the governor's office.

229
00:14:20,144 --> 00:14:22,445
Now, we've cordoned off
the area where the meteor hit.

230
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:25,215
Do not approach it.

231
00:14:25,216 --> 00:14:27,450
I want you to go home
and stay there.

232
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:30,286
And if you live downtown,

233
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:33,556
you stay with a friend or
a family member, all right?

234
00:14:33,557 --> 00:14:36,093
Thank you.

235
00:14:38,162 --> 00:14:39,696
<i>Dad.</i>

236
00:14:39,697 --> 00:14:41,498
I was so worried.

237
00:14:41,499 --> 00:14:43,634
Tim.

238
00:14:43,768 --> 00:14:47,304
-You okay?
-Yeah, it's fine.

239
00:14:47,305 --> 00:14:49,507
What happened? Let
me look at you.

240
00:14:49,508 --> 00:14:52,575
-What hit you?
-Scott Crooge.

241
00:14:52,576 --> 00:14:55,378
You want to know
where Marley was?

242
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:57,982
<i>She was
sneaking around with him.</i>

243
00:14:58,649 --> 00:14:59,783
<i>Is that true?</i>

244
00:14:59,784 --> 00:15:01,518
Yeah.

245
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,219
We'll talk about this later.

246
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,623
<i>Go home. All of you.</i>

247
00:15:05,624 --> 00:15:08,459
Now!

248
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:13,597
You go home, too.

249
00:15:13,598 --> 00:15:15,532
Call your mother. Tell her what
happened and that you'll be late.

250
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:17,100
I'll meet you at the house.

251
00:15:17,101 --> 00:15:19,036
Be safe.

252
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,658
It's getting worse.

253
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:29,249
Why aren't you
leaving with the rest of them?

254
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,957
Taking that son of yours home.

255
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,315
I'm here to help.

256
00:15:32,316 --> 00:15:34,618
We don't need you. The
mayor put calls in.

257
00:15:34,619 --> 00:15:36,686
The cavalry should
be here any minute.

258
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:38,722
Ben, I'm not
working for you right now.

259
00:15:38,723 --> 00:15:41,658
I'm here to help
the people of this town.

260
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:43,460
Something you lost sight
of a long time ago.

261
00:15:43,461 --> 00:15:47,597
Well, now you're not
working for me at all.

262
00:15:50,335 --> 00:15:55,339
Really? You think that
matters right now?

263
00:15:56,307 --> 00:15:57,259
State troopers are here.

264
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,175
You need to warn them.

265
00:15:58,176 --> 00:16:00,110
They have no idea
what they're walking into.

266
00:16:00,111 --> 00:16:02,446
What are you doing? Charlie.

267
00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:17,560
<i>Heard you had a meteor strike.
How cool is that?</i>

268
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:20,598
Well, people are
dead, so not very.

269
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:21,756
You got experience with
this kind of thing?

270
00:16:21,757 --> 00:16:24,200
Experience? What do you mean?

271
00:16:24,201 --> 00:16:26,603
Something is down there. I don't
know what it is, but it's not stopping.

272
00:16:26,604 --> 00:16:29,172
Look, we're the
closest division.

273
00:16:29,173 --> 00:16:31,775
It takes time to pull together
all the resources to get a full squad.

274
00:16:31,776 --> 00:16:33,710
We got this.

275
00:16:33,711 --> 00:16:36,080
I wouldn't go there
if I were you.

276
00:16:43,721 --> 00:16:46,289
It seems to be okay to me.

277
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:50,194
-Get out of there!
-What the hell is that?

278
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:58,768
Come on, Gibbons.

279
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:01,638
Keep going.

280
00:17:03,175 --> 00:17:05,143
Get in here.

281
00:17:30,267 --> 00:17:33,237
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

282
00:17:37,873 --> 00:17:41,468
-Do you think it's over?
-I don't even know what it is.

283
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,281
<i>Let me in! It's me.</i>

284
00:17:44,282 --> 00:17:46,684
Get the door.

285
00:17:50,688 --> 00:17:53,190
A little help would be nice.

286
00:17:56,561 --> 00:17:58,762
<i>What the hell is this, Charlie?</i>

287
00:17:58,763 --> 00:18:01,665
Damned if I know, but it's a hell
of a lot more than just a meteor storm.

288
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,997
Yeah, no kidding.
Did you see that storm?

289
00:18:03,998 --> 00:18:05,012
We all saw it.

290
00:18:05,013 --> 00:18:07,838
We need to get everybody out
of town. Send them over to Tannen.

291
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:10,640
<i>He's right. None of us is
equipped to deal with this.</i>

292
00:18:10,641 --> 00:18:13,877
I'll call Faye, see if she can take
some at the community center.

293
00:18:13,878 --> 00:18:16,813
Tell her to get
whatever resources she needs.

294
00:18:16,814 --> 00:18:19,316
I'll cover the expense.

295
00:18:19,451 --> 00:18:21,819
Okay.

296
00:18:34,832 --> 00:18:36,900
<i>Need some help over here.</i>

297
00:18:58,622 --> 00:19:00,323
<i>So yeah, we can move
that to Monday,</i>

298
00:19:00,324 --> 00:19:01,791
<i>that frees up Tuesday.</i>

299
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:03,961
<i>Excuse me.</i>

300
00:19:03,962 --> 00:19:06,062
Faye, Charlie's on the line
for you. He says it's urgent.

301
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:08,398
You got that?

302
00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:10,868
Excuse me.

303
00:19:13,638 --> 00:19:15,339
Are you okay? Is Tim okay?

304
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,405
He didn't call you?

305
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:17,541
<i>No.</i>

306
00:19:17,542 --> 00:19:19,443
And I've tried calling
but I can't get through.

307
00:19:19,444 --> 00:19:21,412
<i>All right, look, I'm
sure he's fine.</i>

308
00:19:21,413 --> 00:19:22,879
<i>Listen, the mayor
is evacuating town.</i>

309
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,349
Everyone? What's going
on out there?

310
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,650
A meteor hit in the center
of Main Street.

311
00:19:27,651 --> 00:19:30,788
<i>It's total chaos over here.
We need to evacuate.</i>

312
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:32,691
Can you make room
for us over there?

313
00:19:32,692 --> 00:19:34,558
Of course. I'll
make the preparations.

314
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,895
<i>All right, thanks. And Ben said he'd
take care of any extra expenses.</i>

315
00:19:37,896 --> 00:19:39,231
Really?

316
00:19:39,232 --> 00:19:40,093
<i>Yeah.</i>

317
00:19:40,094 --> 00:19:41,393
When should I expect you?

318
00:19:41,394 --> 00:19:44,068
I'll start sending folks
over immediately.

319
00:19:44,069 --> 00:19:47,370
I take it that means you
won't be with them.

320
00:19:47,371 --> 00:19:49,906
I'm going to stay here, make
sure nobody gets left behind.

321
00:19:49,907 --> 00:19:50,859
Charlie.

322
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,774
<i>Faye.</i>

323
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:53,609
Come on,
somebody's got to do it.

324
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,877
<i>It doesn't
always have to be you.</i>

325
00:19:54,878 --> 00:19:58,014
Just be careful, okay?

326
00:19:58,015 --> 00:20:00,083
You know I will.

327
00:20:00,084 --> 00:20:01,069
See you soon.

328
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,986
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

329
00:20:06,057 --> 00:20:08,692
I just talked to Faye. She said
she's going to get ready for us.

330
00:20:08,693 --> 00:20:10,627
I need you to take care of
the evac communications.

331
00:20:10,628 --> 00:20:13,629
Tell people to dress
warmly, bring food and bedding.

332
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,800
-I'll be back soon.
-What? Wait.

333
00:20:16,801 --> 00:20:19,070
<i>Charlie.</i>

334
00:20:20,003 --> 00:20:22,539
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

335
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,608
It'll take us a while to get
these wounded out of here

336
00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:26,510
and the back-up
generator is about to go out.

337
00:20:26,511 --> 00:20:28,846
I got to get
home, grab my tools,

338
00:20:28,847 --> 00:20:32,617
keep the lights and the heat on until
we can get them out of here.

339
00:20:52,102 --> 00:20:54,704
Tim.

340
00:20:54,705 --> 00:20:56,473
<i>What are you doing?</i>

341
00:20:56,474 --> 00:21:00,644
-Hey, did you call your mother?
-I tried, the phone lines are down.

342
00:21:00,645 --> 00:21:02,913
Internet and cable, too.

343
00:21:02,914 --> 00:21:05,416
Honestly, we're
lucky we even have power.

344
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:08,484
Everybody's being evacuated to Tannen
until we can figure this out.

345
00:21:08,485 --> 00:21:10,395
-You should get going.
-What about you?

346
00:21:10,396 --> 00:21:11,985
What are you packing for?

347
00:21:11,986 --> 00:21:14,457
Ben and Mayor Gibbons
are over at the clinic.

348
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,159
<i>There's a lot of wounded and
their power is failing.</i>

349
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,562
I'm going to see if I can
keep the generator running.

350
00:21:19,563 --> 00:21:23,633
Here. You should gear up. It's
getting cold out there.

351
00:21:24,436 --> 00:21:26,904
Was TJ at the clinic, Dad?

352
00:21:26,905 --> 00:21:31,075
<i>I stopped by his house on the
way here. He wasn't there.</i>

353
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:33,042
No.

354
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:36,179
No, he wasn't.

355
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,915
<i>Look,
everybody's being evacuated.</i>

356
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:40,385
You need to get out of here.

357
00:21:42,887 --> 00:21:45,822
Tim, now.

358
00:21:46,757 --> 00:21:49,560
I saw that
thing come down on us.

359
00:21:49,561 --> 00:21:52,829
The meteor.

360
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:56,066
It split into two, changed colors.
It was the craziest thing.

361
00:21:56,067 --> 00:21:59,002
What do you mean split into
two and changed colors?

362
00:21:59,003 --> 00:22:00,971
I didn't see that.

363
00:22:00,972 --> 00:22:02,829
Where did the other part land?

364
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,807
I don't know.

365
00:22:03,808 --> 00:22:07,543
It was headed towards
Mount Dickens, though.

366
00:22:07,544 --> 00:22:10,981
That's far away from civilization.
That's a good sign.

367
00:22:12,649 --> 00:22:14,851
Hey, Tim.

368
00:22:14,852 --> 00:22:17,687
You can talk to me about anything.
You know that, right?

369
00:22:17,688 --> 00:22:21,258
-Even if you don't think I approve.
-Okay.

370
00:22:21,259 --> 00:22:24,528
You know that dent
on the back of your car?

371
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:26,929
-That was me.
-Very funny.

372
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,531
You know, Dad, you can stand up

373
00:22:28,532 --> 00:22:32,836
-to Ben Crooge just a little bit.
-Is that so?

374
00:22:32,837 --> 00:22:36,572
Well, I did
today, and I got fired.

375
00:22:36,573 --> 00:22:40,944
-Okay, very funny.
-I'm not kidding.

376
00:22:40,945 --> 00:22:43,981
Look, your mom's waiting for you.
You should get out of here.

377
00:22:45,215 --> 00:22:49,118
I won't be far behind you.
Don't worry about me.

378
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,590
For luck.

379
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:55,625
Merry Christmas, kid.

380
00:22:57,928 --> 00:23:00,598
Hurry up.

381
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:09,740
<i>I did it for your own good.</i>

382
00:23:09,741 --> 00:23:11,608
Screw off, Scott,
you're not my dad.

383
00:23:11,609 --> 00:23:13,878
Enough. Both of you.

384
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:17,548
There will be
time to discuss this,

385
00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:20,050
but right now we are all going
to Tannen until they sort this out.

386
00:23:20,051 --> 00:23:21,652
<i>Grab your bags.
Marley, you'll ride with Scott.</i>

387
00:23:21,653 --> 00:23:23,119
-What?
-Why?

388
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,022
Because you are brother
and sister,

389
00:23:25,023 --> 00:23:26,614
and one way or another you
are going to get along.

390
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:28,135
What about you?

391
00:23:28,136 --> 00:23:31,995
I'm taking the Parsons.
Their car is in the shop.

392
00:23:51,215 --> 00:23:53,684
Move!

393
00:24:07,998 --> 00:24:10,300
What the hell was that?

394
00:24:12,936 --> 00:24:14,325
That's it.
We're all leaving now.

395
00:24:14,326 --> 00:24:15,120
Okay.

396
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,807
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

397
00:24:28,186 --> 00:24:30,120
Hell.

398
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:37,194
Get in!

399
00:24:37,195 --> 00:24:39,795
-What?
-Let's go. Move!

400
00:24:39,796 --> 00:24:42,198
<i>Get in the car now!</i>

401
00:24:43,734 --> 00:24:46,904
<i>Hurry!</i>

402
00:24:51,775 --> 00:24:54,144
Is that normal for around here?

403
00:24:54,145 --> 00:24:56,113
Nope.

404
00:25:00,017 --> 00:25:02,151
<i>It went the other way.</i>

405
00:25:02,887 --> 00:25:05,222
God.

406
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:17,434
<i>Now what?</i>

407
00:25:17,435 --> 00:25:19,869
You like boats?

408
00:25:25,877 --> 00:25:27,845
Untie the boat.

409
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:31,382
Come on.

410
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:35,418
-It's coming, come on.
-I know.

411
00:25:35,419 --> 00:25:38,288
Hurry, let's go!

412
00:25:43,895 --> 00:25:46,030
-Go!
-Hold on.

413
00:25:51,769 --> 00:25:53,671
<i>Come on.</i>

414
00:25:57,708 --> 00:26:00,009
<i>How are we doing?</i>

415
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:02,846
Hurry up.

416
00:26:02,847 --> 00:26:04,981
It's floored. I'm going
as fast as I can.

417
00:26:04,982 --> 00:26:07,218
Got to go faster, man.

418
00:26:15,426 --> 00:26:17,426
It's not slowing down.

419
00:26:17,427 --> 00:26:19,463
<i>I know.</i>

420
00:26:19,464 --> 00:26:21,865
<i>Go!</i>

421
00:26:21,866 --> 00:26:23,433
<i>Come on.</i>

422
00:26:23,434 --> 00:26:27,172
-Faster!
-I'm running out of lake.

423
00:26:30,841 --> 00:26:32,008
<i>Faster!</i>

424
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:34,277
Come on!

425
00:26:34,278 --> 00:26:36,781
<i>We're going to have to beach it.</i>

426
00:26:37,948 --> 00:26:39,949
<i>We're not going to make it.</i>

427
00:26:45,156 --> 00:26:47,957
Hang on.

428
00:26:49,494 --> 00:26:51,829
Get ready to jump.

429
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,734
Go!

430
00:26:57,435 --> 00:27:00,236
Go, come on, go, go!

431
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:10,313
Ben. Something's happening
west of the lake.

432
00:27:11,248 --> 00:27:14,117
-Another meteor?
-I don't know.

433
00:27:14,118 --> 00:27:17,387
Listen, Stu Carson just came
in. He's covered in frost bite

434
00:27:17,388 --> 00:27:19,455
and he's screaming about
flash freezing.

435
00:27:19,456 --> 00:27:21,524
According to him,
Highway 10 is completely blocked

436
00:27:21,525 --> 00:27:24,961
with giant chunks of ice.

437
00:27:24,962 --> 00:27:28,898
I guess the idea of all this stopping
just went out the window.

438
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:32,034
<i>I don't care if you have to put ten
people to a car, we need to evacuate.</i>

439
00:27:32,035 --> 00:27:34,870
The only way out of this town
now is the back roads.

440
00:27:34,871 --> 00:27:36,773
All right.

441
00:27:46,283 --> 00:27:50,119
-What happened back there?
-It's called a flash freeze.

442
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,922
But I've only read accounts.

443
00:27:51,923 --> 00:27:55,090
I've never
experienced one in person.

444
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:58,061
Well, I've seen quite a few
in the last couple of hours.

445
00:27:59,296 --> 00:28:01,197
Up this way.

446
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:08,271
And none of this before
the meteor hit?

447
00:28:08,272 --> 00:28:11,474
Wait, no.

448
00:28:11,475 --> 00:28:13,577
How do you know
about the meteor?

449
00:28:13,578 --> 00:28:18,447
-Who exactly are you anyway?
-I'm Alex. Alex Novak.

450
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:21,016
<i>I'm a grad student at the
university getting a PhD in astrophysics.</i>

451
00:28:21,017 --> 00:28:23,319
I was tracking that meteor.

452
00:28:24,288 --> 00:28:27,323
Charlie Ratchet.

453
00:28:27,324 --> 00:28:29,458
Nice to meet you.

454
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:31,168
You sure picked a hell of a
way to spend your Christmas.

455
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:32,981
I'd say.

456
00:28:32,982 --> 00:28:34,330
So, what happened back there?

457
00:28:34,331 --> 00:28:36,299
You've never seen anything
like that before?

458
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,234
No. That's why if it
is linked to the meteor...

459
00:28:38,235 --> 00:28:41,338
Wait, what do you mean linked
to the meteor? How?

460
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:43,906
It's so far away from here.

461
00:28:43,907 --> 00:28:47,977
If I'm right,
it's spreading. I mean...

462
00:28:47,978 --> 00:28:51,247
That's why I need to see the impact
crater as soon as possible.

463
00:28:53,618 --> 00:28:56,086
Well, I can take you
as far as the clinic.

464
00:28:56,087 --> 00:28:58,355
Last I knew the mayor was there.

465
00:28:58,356 --> 00:29:01,325
You and he can discuss
what you want to do from there.

466
00:29:07,231 --> 00:29:09,398
<i>Are you old
school or new school?</i>

467
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:10,359
What?

468
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,537
I think I know a way
we can make up some time.

469
00:29:14,638 --> 00:29:16,438
Let's go.

470
00:29:16,439 --> 00:29:19,376
Right behind you.

471
00:29:19,377 --> 00:29:22,646
What, they didn't teach you
how to snowboard in school, Novak?

472
00:29:22,647 --> 00:29:24,849
Just keep going!

473
00:29:52,676 --> 00:29:55,446
-Thank God you're okay.
-I'm fine.

474
00:29:56,213 --> 00:29:58,348
-Your lip.
-I tripped.

475
00:29:58,349 --> 00:30:00,516
It's nothing.

476
00:30:01,653 --> 00:30:02,738
Any news?

477
00:30:02,739 --> 00:30:05,155
No. Only that it's bad.

478
00:30:05,156 --> 00:30:08,191
-Dad's still out there, obviously.
-I'm aware.

479
00:30:08,192 --> 00:30:11,127
Mom, have you,

480
00:30:11,128 --> 00:30:14,964
you haven't happened to see Marley
Crooge around, have you?

481
00:30:14,965 --> 00:30:17,266
No, not yet.

482
00:30:17,267 --> 00:30:21,938
Hey, I need some man power.
Let's help unload.

483
00:30:22,173 --> 00:30:24,141
Sure thing.

484
00:30:25,141 --> 00:30:28,178
-Hey, how's it going?
-This is great.

485
00:30:28,179 --> 00:30:29,212
I got that.

486
00:30:29,213 --> 00:30:30,981
I just got a bunch
of boxes back here.

487
00:30:30,982 --> 00:30:33,450
Great, thanks.

488
00:30:33,451 --> 00:30:36,487
Hey, I'll be right back.

489
00:30:39,557 --> 00:30:41,458
Marley.

490
00:30:51,569 --> 00:30:54,539
-Here, I got that.
-Thanks.

491
00:30:57,742 --> 00:31:00,978
<i>What the hell is this?</i>

492
00:31:01,244 --> 00:31:03,179
Scott, stop it!

493
00:31:06,183 --> 00:31:07,416
What's your problem, buddy?

494
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:09,452
You're blocking the road!

495
00:31:09,453 --> 00:31:11,955
Really?

496
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,459
Scott, stop!

497
00:31:17,594 --> 00:31:20,696
-What is your problem?
-My truck's broken.

498
00:31:20,697 --> 00:31:25,435
-Can we give you a hand?
-That'd be great.

499
00:31:25,436 --> 00:31:28,739
Just go back to the car.
I'll deal with this.

500
00:31:31,175 --> 00:31:34,244
Hi. Sorry, what's
going on? What's the problem?

501
00:31:35,212 --> 00:31:36,976
Charlie, where the
heck have you been?

502
00:31:36,977 --> 00:31:41,250
We have got no phones, we've got a
little bit of power but the generator's bit...

503
00:31:42,653 --> 00:31:45,254
Who's this?

504
00:31:45,255 --> 00:31:47,089
I'm Alex Novak, from
the university.

505
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,591
Did the governor send you?

506
00:31:49,592 --> 00:31:53,562
No, I was following the meteor
as part of my research project.

507
00:31:53,563 --> 00:31:56,765
Charlie, the generator is running
hot. Where's your tools?

508
00:31:56,766 --> 00:31:58,635
-I had to ditch them.
-Excuse me.

509
00:31:58,636 --> 00:32:01,137
I need to find the meteorite.
Where is it?

510
00:32:01,138 --> 00:32:02,704
<i>Middle of Main Street,
for all the good it'll do you.</i>

511
00:32:02,705 --> 00:32:05,608
-It's the eye of the storm.
-Okay, which direction?

512
00:32:05,609 --> 00:32:06,969
It's suicide
going back out there.

513
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,055
Look, I'm going.

514
00:32:08,056 --> 00:32:10,379
This is obviously not your
garden variety meteor,

515
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,247
and I'm going to need a sample.

516
00:32:12,248 --> 00:32:13,550
Thank you.

517
00:32:13,551 --> 00:32:15,717
<i>If it wasn't for you,</i>

518
00:32:15,718 --> 00:32:17,686
well, I think you know.

519
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:20,556
I...

520
00:32:21,725 --> 00:32:23,560
I'm going to take this.

521
00:32:23,561 --> 00:32:26,295
Merry Christmas.

522
00:32:27,531 --> 00:32:29,433
All right guys, let's go.

523
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:34,405
Come on. We can't just let
her go out there alone.

524
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:37,608
Really?

525
00:32:38,475 --> 00:32:40,476
Nice.

526
00:32:41,411 --> 00:32:43,213
Keep this on channel five.

527
00:32:43,214 --> 00:32:44,848
Now, Charlie,
hold on a second now.

528
00:32:44,849 --> 00:32:46,849
We're almost
done evacuating here.

529
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,056
When that last transport
leaves...

530
00:32:48,057 --> 00:32:52,722
-We're out of here.
-That's the Christmas spirit.

531
00:32:54,225 --> 00:32:56,192
Let's go ahead and
get the coolers

532
00:32:56,193 --> 00:32:57,760
and make sure there's plenty
of sandwiches, okay?

533
00:32:57,761 --> 00:33:00,164
Okay, thanks.

534
00:33:05,636 --> 00:33:07,369
Faye?

535
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,672
Crystal.

536
00:33:09,673 --> 00:33:11,741
What you're doing is great.

537
00:33:11,742 --> 00:33:14,711
Thank you so
much for helping us.

538
00:33:18,616 --> 00:33:20,750
What's wrong?

539
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:22,452
<i>I can't reach Marley or Scott.</i>

540
00:33:22,453 --> 00:33:24,820
<i>No one's seen them.</i>

541
00:33:24,821 --> 00:33:26,723
There's no cell reception.

542
00:33:26,724 --> 00:33:28,558
I saw Jim dropping
people off from the clinic.

543
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,360
They're not there, either.

544
00:33:31,361 --> 00:33:32,649
I'm really worried, Faye.

545
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:35,298
Hey, it's all
right. We'll find them.

546
00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:37,201
They should be here by now.

547
00:33:43,174 --> 00:33:44,807
This is crazy.

548
00:33:44,808 --> 00:33:46,943
I've been tracking this
meteor for weeks.

549
00:33:46,944 --> 00:33:49,378
Never in a million years did
I believe something like this

550
00:33:49,379 --> 00:33:51,214
would or even could happen.

551
00:33:51,215 --> 00:33:53,515
All the more reason
to stay away.

552
00:33:53,516 --> 00:33:55,585
I'm not asking
you to come with me.

553
00:33:55,586 --> 00:33:57,753
That thing has killed everybody
that's gotten near it.

554
00:33:57,754 --> 00:34:01,292
-It didn't kill you.
-Not yet.

555
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:26,183
I don't think
it's such a good idea.

556
00:34:26,951 --> 00:34:29,919
I know.

557
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,988
I just need to get
some readings.

558
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:35,858
Does this area have
a history of tremors?

559
00:34:35,859 --> 00:34:40,596
No, it started with the impact.
Same as the ice storms.

560
00:34:44,802 --> 00:34:47,571
All right, we really need
to get out of here.

561
00:35:14,831 --> 00:35:16,399
-Easy there.
-Hi, Rob.

562
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,001
Sorry, I just thought I...

563
00:35:18,002 --> 00:35:20,269
-What's wrong?
-Felt something.

564
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:22,671
Have you seen Tim? I
don't know where he went off to.

565
00:35:22,672 --> 00:35:25,375
Yeah, I just saw
him head outside.

566
00:35:52,402 --> 00:35:53,970
Alex.

567
00:35:53,971 --> 00:35:55,071
Alex, you okay?

568
00:35:55,072 --> 00:35:57,407
<i>Yeah.</i>

569
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:04,346
-You?
-I think so.

570
00:36:34,344 --> 00:36:36,979
Here, hold this.

571
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:40,417
-Your leg.
-Yeah.

572
00:36:58,735 --> 00:37:02,004
Okay, look, this thing,

573
00:37:02,005 --> 00:37:04,807
whatever it is, this is
a major breakthrough.

574
00:37:04,808 --> 00:37:06,401
There's no precedent for
something like this.

575
00:37:06,402 --> 00:37:08,223
Yeah, well, I'm no astronomer,

576
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:11,381
but I'm pretty sure the meteor isn't
supposed to change the weather.

577
00:37:11,382 --> 00:37:15,651
This meteorite, technically,
now that it's hit the ground,

578
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:17,120
you're right.

579
00:37:17,121 --> 00:37:19,421
Where are we?

580
00:37:19,422 --> 00:37:21,823
<i>In the old mine
shaft underneath the town.</i>

581
00:37:21,824 --> 00:37:23,859
It's freezing down here.

582
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:29,164
-Why is that?
-I think that meteorite is causing it.

583
00:37:29,165 --> 00:37:31,834
I think so, too.

584
00:37:31,835 --> 00:37:34,137
<i>It's amazing.</i>

585
00:37:34,138 --> 00:37:36,838
Scientists have
debated for years

586
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:39,542
whether the water on Earth
originally came from the ice in meteors,

587
00:37:39,543 --> 00:37:43,079
but the Earth has so much water

588
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,781
that hypothesis could
never be supported with evidence.

589
00:37:45,782 --> 00:37:49,651
But this, this is some
serious evidence.

590
00:37:49,652 --> 00:37:52,754
Well, congratulations.

591
00:37:52,755 --> 00:37:54,890
We're not climbing out of there.

592
00:37:54,891 --> 00:37:59,428
<i>I think if we go that way,</i>

593
00:37:59,429 --> 00:38:01,797
it'll take us back
to the clinic.

594
00:38:44,107 --> 00:38:46,676
Alex.

595
00:38:46,677 --> 00:38:49,413
Alex, you're
going the wrong way.

596
00:38:50,147 --> 00:38:53,049
She's just like my freaking kid.

597
00:39:17,107 --> 00:39:19,609
Are you kidding me?

598
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,743
This is
unbelievable. I need a sample.

599
00:39:21,744 --> 00:39:24,046
Are you crazy?

600
00:39:24,047 --> 00:39:26,516
What do you mean?

601
00:39:29,853 --> 00:39:31,653
It's happening. We need
to get out of here.

602
00:39:31,654 --> 00:39:33,622
Let's move, come on!

603
00:39:35,893 --> 00:39:37,761
Take cover!

604
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:40,729
Get down!

605
00:40:01,618 --> 00:40:04,621
Get inside, now!

606
00:40:15,031 --> 00:40:16,899
My God!

607
00:40:17,801 --> 00:40:19,735
Hey, did you feel that, man?

608
00:40:27,578 --> 00:40:30,046
<i>Okay, we got to get
going now. Okay? Now!</i>

609
00:40:30,047 --> 00:40:32,682
Chill!

610
00:40:33,049 --> 00:40:35,784
Scott!

611
00:40:44,962 --> 00:40:47,063
Run!

612
00:40:49,665 --> 00:40:50,999
Marley.

613
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,203
Scott, run!

614
00:40:55,706 --> 00:40:56,705
<i>No!</i>

615
00:40:56,706 --> 00:40:58,707
No, Marley!

616
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:01,076
Run! Run!

617
00:41:12,656 --> 00:41:15,659
Wait. Wait!

618
00:41:46,889 --> 00:41:48,891
Alex?

619
00:41:51,194 --> 00:41:54,263
-What happened?
-I don't know.

620
00:41:54,264 --> 00:41:55,798
We're still alive.

621
00:41:55,799 --> 00:41:58,168
Come on, let me help you up.

622
00:42:03,739 --> 00:42:05,641
Here, take this.

623
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:17,385
I think these
lanterns may have saved us.

624
00:42:17,386 --> 00:42:21,256
I mean, as a heat
source. Look at the ground.

625
00:42:21,257 --> 00:42:23,688
<i>It's a giant circle.</i>

626
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:26,750
No, it can't be that simple.

627
00:42:26,751 --> 00:42:29,898
<i>Sometimes the right
answer is the most obvious one.</i>

628
00:42:30,734 --> 00:42:32,936
You still want that sample?

629
00:42:33,302 --> 00:42:37,674
No. Let's go.

630
00:42:42,179 --> 00:42:45,180
And another one for
the hungry kids.

631
00:42:45,181 --> 00:42:47,216
There you go.

632
00:42:48,851 --> 00:42:50,952
Did you find Tim yet?

633
00:42:50,953 --> 00:42:52,888
He left.

634
00:42:52,889 --> 00:42:55,358
I think he went looking
for Marley.

635
00:42:57,427 --> 00:42:58,894
-Heli-skiing.
-What?

636
00:42:58,895 --> 00:43:01,230
Give me your phone.

637
00:43:02,732 --> 00:43:06,068
Ben bought a
heli-skiing company last summer.

638
00:43:09,973 --> 00:43:12,207
Cole? This is Crystal.

639
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:16,045
I need you to drop
everything right now. I have a crisis.

640
00:43:22,918 --> 00:43:26,254
My God. My...

641
00:43:27,891 --> 00:43:32,228
Help! Help!

642
00:43:56,987 --> 00:44:00,255
Scott! Scott!

643
00:44:05,161 --> 00:44:07,796
Scott. Scott!

644
00:44:07,797 --> 00:44:10,265
My God. My...

645
00:44:10,266 --> 00:44:12,402
No.

646
00:44:12,435 --> 00:44:14,436
Scott!

647
00:44:15,572 --> 00:44:18,907
Ben, Mayor
Gibbons, do you copy? Over.

648
00:44:29,118 --> 00:44:32,788
<i>Ben, Mayor Gibbons, do you copy?</i>

649
00:44:36,458 --> 00:44:39,061
<i>Ben, do you copy? Over.</i>

650
00:45:24,507 --> 00:45:29,510
That meteorite is altering the entire
micro-climate of this area.

651
00:45:29,511 --> 00:45:31,914
So nothing like this has ever
been documented before?

652
00:45:31,915 --> 00:45:32,738
You've never seen
anything like this?

653
00:45:32,739 --> 00:45:35,084
Documented? No.

654
00:45:35,085 --> 00:45:37,419
I find that hard to believe.

655
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:41,055
There's evidence of all sorts
of crazy stuff that doesn't add up.

656
00:45:41,056 --> 00:45:45,361
Our world has only been
scientifically aware for a few thousand years.

657
00:45:45,362 --> 00:45:50,164
Do you know what that amounts to
in a 4.5 billion-year-old planet?

658
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:52,401
The blink of an eye.

659
00:45:52,402 --> 00:45:55,437
That's precisely
why I got into science.

660
00:45:55,438 --> 00:45:57,506
Well, we better get
you out of town

661
00:45:57,507 --> 00:45:59,575
or you're not
going to see graduation.

662
00:45:59,576 --> 00:46:01,376
If this keeps up,

663
00:46:01,377 --> 00:46:04,178
we're not going to make
it past Christmas.

664
00:46:04,179 --> 00:46:06,582
What the hell is that?

665
00:46:06,583 --> 00:46:09,552
<i>God, it looks like an igloo.</i>

666
00:46:13,022 --> 00:46:16,124
-Come with me.
-Where are we going?

667
00:46:16,125 --> 00:46:19,527
To do a little last minute
Christmas shopping.

668
00:46:23,266 --> 00:46:25,683
Cole, this is Faye Ratchet,
can you hear me?

669
00:46:25,684 --> 00:46:27,475
<i>Loud and clear, Faye.</i>

670
00:46:27,476 --> 00:46:32,140
<i>We're about five miles out keeping
our eyes peeled for any stranded people.</i>

671
00:46:32,141 --> 00:46:34,575
Highway 5 is blocked,
the passage is buried.

672
00:46:34,576 --> 00:46:36,711
<i>The only way out
of Lennox is on foot.</i>

673
00:46:36,712 --> 00:46:38,446
Can you see anything moving?

674
00:46:38,447 --> 00:46:40,448
<i>Cars? People?</i>

675
00:46:40,449 --> 00:46:42,984
<i>Not so far.</i>

676
00:46:42,985 --> 00:46:45,720
Me and Gary aren't exactly search
and rescue, but we'll do our best.

677
00:46:45,721 --> 00:46:48,222
Thank you. I can't tell
you how much this means to us.

678
00:46:48,223 --> 00:46:50,492
<i>Hey, no worries.</i>

679
00:46:50,493 --> 00:46:54,028
It wouldn't be Christmas
unless someone needed saving, right?

680
00:46:54,029 --> 00:46:56,397
Gary, let's split up.

681
00:46:56,398 --> 00:46:58,533
<i>I'll start with the
city limits and search south.</i>

682
00:46:58,534 --> 00:47:00,102
<i>You take
everything to the north.</i>

683
00:47:00,103 --> 00:47:03,039
Roger that, big
C. I'm on my way.

684
00:47:05,007 --> 00:47:07,409
Copy.

685
00:47:10,112 --> 00:47:12,915
<i>Scott!</i>

686
00:47:23,592 --> 00:47:25,995
Scott. Scott!

687
00:47:25,996 --> 00:47:27,396
No! God!

688
00:47:27,397 --> 00:47:28,463
My God!

689
00:47:28,464 --> 00:47:31,167
Scott!

690
00:47:32,368 --> 00:47:34,636
Scott.

691
00:47:38,141 --> 00:47:39,675
<i>Marley.</i>

692
00:47:39,676 --> 00:47:43,045
-Marley.
-My God, Tim.

693
00:47:44,179 --> 00:47:47,215
It's okay. It's all right.

694
00:47:57,127 --> 00:47:59,227
Come on, we have to
move. Come on, we have to go.

695
00:47:59,228 --> 00:48:02,497
Scott! No!

696
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:17,145
You sure about this?

697
00:48:21,183 --> 00:48:23,252
Yeah.

698
00:48:46,775 --> 00:48:50,413
Ben, Mayor Gibbons,
do you read me? Over.

699
00:48:51,647 --> 00:48:54,149
Anybody copy? Over.

700
00:48:55,685 --> 00:48:57,719
Damn.

701
00:49:17,107 --> 00:49:20,076
We're too late.

702
00:50:03,319 --> 00:50:06,188
Ben?

703
00:50:08,257 --> 00:50:10,259
Are you okay?

704
00:50:11,261 --> 00:50:13,928
<i>No, Ben. It's not your fault.</i>

705
00:50:13,929 --> 00:50:15,439
Okay?

706
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:21,404
-Come on, get up.
-I panicked, I ran inside here.

707
00:50:22,538 --> 00:50:24,740
And hid.

708
00:50:24,741 --> 00:50:27,342
I don't know why I lived.

709
00:50:28,411 --> 00:50:31,813
And I didn't save
him. I didn't save anyone.

710
00:50:33,183 --> 00:50:35,417
<i>What have I done?</i>

711
00:50:35,418 --> 00:50:37,686
Charlie...

712
00:50:39,755 --> 00:50:41,722
I closed the door on them.

713
00:50:41,723 --> 00:50:44,292
<i>I hid in the boiler room.</i>

714
00:50:44,293 --> 00:50:46,762
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

715
00:50:46,763 --> 00:50:49,363
It's okay. Ben, it's all right.

716
00:50:49,364 --> 00:50:51,234
It's okay.

717
00:50:52,268 --> 00:50:54,702
You'll be all
right. Let me help you up.

718
00:50:54,703 --> 00:50:56,839
Slowly. Come on.

719
00:50:57,507 --> 00:50:59,709
Let's get out of here.

720
00:51:11,721 --> 00:51:13,521
This is incredible.

721
00:51:13,522 --> 00:51:15,591
<i>It looks like the North Pole.</i>

722
00:51:15,592 --> 00:51:18,194
<i>It's an Arctic wasteland.</i>

723
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:21,830
What do you mean?

724
00:51:21,831 --> 00:51:24,466
<i>There's nothing left.</i>

725
00:51:24,467 --> 00:51:26,301
<i>Snow and ice as
far as I can see.</i>

726
00:51:26,302 --> 00:51:29,338
<i>There's no buildings, no cars.</i>

727
00:51:29,339 --> 00:51:31,673
There's nothing.

728
00:51:31,674 --> 00:51:34,309
<i>Lennox is gone.</i>

729
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:37,579
<i>Roger that, Cole. I haven't
found anyone either.</i>

730
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:40,183
<i>I'll head towards town,
do another sweep.</i>

731
00:51:50,726 --> 00:51:52,327
Hey!

732
00:51:52,328 --> 00:51:53,762
-Over here.
-Hey.

733
00:51:53,763 --> 00:51:56,199
<i>We're down here.</i>

734
00:51:56,299 --> 00:51:57,531
Wait!

735
00:51:57,532 --> 00:51:58,867
They've got to see us.

736
00:51:58,868 --> 00:52:00,902
Hey!

737
00:52:06,375 --> 00:52:08,809
What the hell?

738
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:10,544
<i>I'm looking at Dickens Peak.</i>

739
00:52:10,545 --> 00:52:13,314
<i>There's a whole
area that's untouched.</i>

740
00:52:13,315 --> 00:52:15,750
<i>There's no snow on it at all.</i>

741
00:52:16,552 --> 00:52:18,854
I'm going to check it out.

742
00:52:18,855 --> 00:52:20,821
-We're down here.
-Wait.

743
00:52:20,822 --> 00:52:23,759
We're here, please.

744
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:23,828
Wait! Stop!

745
00:52:23,829 --> 00:52:26,996
-Stop!
-We got to move.

746
00:52:29,898 --> 00:52:32,301
Can anyone hear me?

747
00:52:32,302 --> 00:52:35,870
Hello? Great.

748
00:52:35,871 --> 00:52:37,553
We have to get out of
here, we have to get to Tannen.

749
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:38,807
Maybe not.

750
00:52:38,808 --> 00:52:40,193
What are you thinking?

751
00:52:40,194 --> 00:52:41,542
What choice do we have?

752
00:52:41,543 --> 00:52:44,379
<i>No good choices. I'm just
trying to find the least crappy one.</i>

753
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:46,647
I'm thinking there may
be a way to stop this thing.

754
00:52:46,648 --> 00:52:48,536
<i>No, we run, we get
as far away as possible.</i>

755
00:52:48,537 --> 00:52:50,718
Run where, Ben?

756
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:53,055
<i>We have no idea how far this thing
is spreading or how fast.</i>

757
00:52:53,056 --> 00:52:54,990
If we have a chance
to stop it, it's now.

758
00:52:54,991 --> 00:52:58,894
I'm not absolute about this,
but heat, extreme heat,

759
00:52:58,895 --> 00:53:02,530
is a reactant.
That's been made clear.

760
00:53:02,531 --> 00:53:04,432
So if we can
produce enough heat...

761
00:53:04,433 --> 00:53:06,635
At the source of the impact,
We'd have a shot.

762
00:53:06,636 --> 00:53:09,004
<i>A shot at what? Killing
ourselves?</i>

763
00:53:09,005 --> 00:53:11,506
<i>It's about re-balancing nature.</i>

764
00:53:11,507 --> 00:53:13,608
A subatomic chain reaction
is taking place.

765
00:53:13,609 --> 00:53:16,410
It's not magic, it's science.

766
00:53:16,411 --> 00:53:18,013
<i>And it can be stopped if we can produce
enough heat at the source.</i>

767
00:53:18,014 --> 00:53:20,749
How about dynamite?

768
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:22,194
Yeah, if there's enough, maybe.

769
00:53:22,195 --> 00:53:23,617
<i>Yeah, there's enough.</i>

770
00:53:23,618 --> 00:53:26,455
I sign the
invoices, I should know.

771
00:53:26,456 --> 00:53:27,858
Let's get to the resort.

772
00:53:27,859 --> 00:53:28,893
Yeah.

773
00:53:34,996 --> 00:53:36,866
Look.

774
00:53:54,016 --> 00:53:56,585
<i>Listen, I've covered
the whole area around town.</i>

775
00:53:56,586 --> 00:54:00,655
<i>I haven't seen
anyone. It's creepy, so...</i>

776
00:54:00,656 --> 00:54:03,124
I'm going to circle back to
the clinic building now.

777
00:54:03,125 --> 00:54:05,994
See if I can find anyone there.

778
00:54:19,842 --> 00:54:21,176
Do you hear that?

779
00:54:21,177 --> 00:54:22,943
Right there.

780
00:54:22,944 --> 00:54:24,446
Hey.

781
00:54:24,447 --> 00:54:25,747
Over here.

782
00:54:25,748 --> 00:54:28,384
Hey.

783
00:54:30,819 --> 00:54:32,787
<i>Yo, yo, yo. I got survivors.</i>

784
00:54:32,788 --> 00:54:34,890
<i>Three of them.</i>

785
00:54:34,891 --> 00:54:39,362
Two men, one
woman. I'm landing now.

786
00:54:40,596 --> 00:54:43,766
Awfully nice of you to arrange
transportation for us.

787
00:54:53,141 --> 00:54:56,078
Watch your step on the way down.

788
00:54:56,813 --> 00:54:59,548
Hey, Marley, come on.

789
00:54:59,549 --> 00:55:01,582
Get up.

790
00:55:01,583 --> 00:55:03,618
You're freezing.

791
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:10,024
-We have to keep moving.
-No.

792
00:55:10,025 --> 00:55:11,559
Marley, we have to keep
moving. Come on.

793
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:14,962
-Come on.
-Okay.

794
00:55:17,833 --> 00:55:19,935
<i>It's coming back.</i>

795
00:55:26,542 --> 00:55:28,578
-Come on.
-No.

796
00:55:31,647 --> 00:55:33,814
Wait, wait. I
think I see something.

797
00:55:33,815 --> 00:55:36,251
<i>It looks like two people
near Avery Wood.</i>

798
00:55:36,252 --> 00:55:37,785
<i>I'm going to head lower,
check it out.</i>

799
00:55:37,786 --> 00:55:39,588
Who is it? Can you
see who it is?

800
00:55:39,589 --> 00:55:42,558
<i>Not yet. Stand by.</i>

801
00:55:43,558 --> 00:55:45,860
Over here, over here. Come on.

802
00:55:47,196 --> 00:55:49,130
Look.

803
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,970
Yeah, it looks like Tim
Ratchet and Marley.

804
00:55:54,971 --> 00:55:56,504
Crystal, come quick!

805
00:55:56,505 --> 00:55:59,039
-He saw us.
-Thank God.

806
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,909
-Come on.
-Okay.

807
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:03,879
They spotted Tim and Marley.

808
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,280
<i>Boy, folks,
it's definitely them.</i>

809
00:56:06,281 --> 00:56:09,050
Christmas has
come early. Ho, ho, ho.

810
00:56:09,051 --> 00:56:11,619
<i>I'm setting her down.</i>

811
00:56:23,132 --> 00:56:25,000
My God.

812
00:56:25,301 --> 00:56:27,569
No!

813
00:56:30,973 --> 00:56:33,609
Gary.

814
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:37,246
My God.

815
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:40,982
Look out. Look out.

816
00:56:46,255 --> 00:56:47,722
<i>Gary.</i>

817
00:56:47,723 --> 00:56:49,858
<i>Come in, Gary.</i>

818
00:56:49,859 --> 00:56:52,795
<i>Gary, do you copy?</i>

819
00:56:54,196 --> 00:56:56,264
Gary.

820
00:57:01,136 --> 00:57:03,805
Gary.

821
00:57:05,708 --> 00:57:07,609
Cole, what's happening?

822
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:10,345
Faye. Faye, is that you?

823
00:57:10,346 --> 00:57:11,608
Charlie?

824
00:57:11,609 --> 00:57:12,580
<i>Yeah, it's me.</i>

825
00:57:12,581 --> 00:57:14,316
Ben's here, too.

826
00:57:14,317 --> 00:57:16,785
Ben. Ben.

827
00:57:16,786 --> 00:57:18,787
Something happened.

828
00:57:18,788 --> 00:57:20,635
<i>Gary saw Tim and Marley
near Avery Wood,</i>

829
00:57:20,636 --> 00:57:22,823
<i>but then he yelled and...</i>

830
00:57:22,824 --> 00:57:24,658
We're heading that way.

831
00:57:24,659 --> 00:57:26,861
<i>Faye, I need
you to listen to me.</i>

832
00:57:26,862 --> 00:57:28,796
This thing is
spreading and it is cold.

833
00:57:28,797 --> 00:57:30,798
Arctic storm cold.

834
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:33,033
<i>Barricade
yourselves inside. Build fires.</i>

835
00:57:33,034 --> 00:57:35,135
<i>Any heat source that can
survive a blackout.</i>

836
00:57:35,136 --> 00:57:37,738
Do not go outside.

837
00:57:37,739 --> 00:57:39,366
We have a plan to stop this.

838
00:57:39,367 --> 00:57:40,307
<i>We?</i>

839
00:57:40,308 --> 00:57:44,044
Ben, me, and Alex Novak,
an astrophysicist.

840
00:57:44,045 --> 00:57:47,916
<i>Faye, I'm serious.
Do not try to evacuate.</i>

841
00:57:47,917 --> 00:57:51,385
Build up as much heat as you possibly can
inside. That's your only protection.

842
00:57:51,386 --> 00:57:53,622
<i>I understand.</i>

843
00:57:53,623 --> 00:57:55,222
Charlie, the kids.

844
00:57:55,223 --> 00:57:57,692
Faye, I'll find them. I swear.

845
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:01,729
We got this.

846
00:58:10,839 --> 00:58:12,006
Marley.

847
00:58:12,007 --> 00:58:14,342
Marley.

848
00:58:17,712 --> 00:58:19,146
Are you okay?

849
00:58:19,147 --> 00:58:21,149
My leg, it's stuck.

850
00:58:26,054 --> 00:58:30,259
God, I'm so cold.

851
00:58:35,364 --> 00:58:38,766
The helicopter, it's gone.

852
00:58:42,871 --> 00:58:45,140
Tim, it's over.

853
00:58:45,141 --> 00:58:47,142
We'll never make it out here.
We'll freeze to death.

854
00:58:47,143 --> 00:58:49,278
Just put this on.

855
00:58:50,446 --> 00:58:52,213
Get up.

856
00:58:52,214 --> 00:58:54,281
Look at me. Stamp your feet.

857
00:58:54,282 --> 00:58:57,718
Do anything to stay warm.
All right, trust me.

858
00:58:57,719 --> 00:58:59,421
Look at me. Look at me.

859
00:58:59,422 --> 00:59:01,321
We are going to make it, okay?

860
00:59:01,322 --> 00:59:03,758
We are going to make
it out of this, all right?

861
00:59:03,759 --> 00:59:07,428
We are. Just
think warm thoughts.

862
00:59:07,429 --> 00:59:09,132
I'm going to be right back.

863
00:59:09,133 --> 00:59:10,167
Where are you going?

864
00:59:13,134 --> 00:59:15,670
I'm going to go start a fire.

865
00:59:23,011 --> 00:59:24,812
I'll get the
radio in just a minute.

866
00:59:24,813 --> 00:59:26,314
I've got to go outside
and deal with something

867
00:59:26,315 --> 00:59:27,781
before they board this place up.

868
00:59:27,782 --> 00:59:30,718
Oops, here you go.

869
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:32,454
<i>Faye.</i>

870
00:59:32,455 --> 00:59:34,789
-We're going to Billings.
-What?

871
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:37,024
I've got a
four-wheel drive, We'll be okay.

872
00:59:37,025 --> 00:59:39,493
You don't understand.
Highway 5 is blocked, so is the pass.

873
00:59:39,494 --> 00:59:42,406
-There is no way out.
-We'll take our chances.

874
00:59:42,407 --> 00:59:43,964
Don't do this.

875
00:59:43,965 --> 00:59:46,401
Charlie said to stay inside.
He was adamant.

876
00:59:46,402 --> 00:59:49,903
Look, we made our decision.

877
00:59:49,904 --> 00:59:51,905
I know those roads
like the back of my hand.

878
00:59:51,906 --> 00:59:54,975
-We've got to get help.
-Rob, don't.

879
00:59:54,976 --> 00:59:59,246
Don't worry.
We'll be back with help.

880
01:00:15,998 --> 01:00:19,968
-See anything?
-No.

881
01:00:25,306 --> 01:00:26,441
Cole, what's wrong?

882
01:00:26,442 --> 01:00:28,843
The cold makes
everything a little bit sticky.

883
01:00:28,844 --> 01:00:31,813
Wait, over there on the right.

884
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,501
Now all we need are
the chestnuts.

885
01:00:54,502 --> 01:00:56,204
I think I prefer some hot cocoa.

886
01:00:56,205 --> 01:00:59,840
With marshmallows.

887
01:01:02,076 --> 01:01:04,846
Did you hear something?

888
01:01:09,851 --> 01:01:13,288
Maybe it was just
Santa on a dry run.

889
01:01:26,435 --> 01:01:28,304
Everything's freezing up.

890
01:01:28,305 --> 01:01:29,089
What?

891
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:30,806
God.

892
01:01:33,208 --> 01:01:35,943
<i>We're going down. Everything's
freezing up.</i>

893
01:01:35,944 --> 01:01:38,046
Mayday. Mayday.
We're going down.

894
01:01:38,047 --> 01:01:42,584
Hello? Hello? Come on. Hello?

895
01:01:42,585 --> 01:01:47,588
<i>My latlong is north 45:47:12
west 1:08:32:14.</i>

896
01:01:47,589 --> 01:01:50,024
Brace yourselves.

897
01:02:10,045 --> 01:02:11,245
Tim?

898
01:02:11,246 --> 01:02:13,013
Yeah?

899
01:02:13,014 --> 01:02:15,917
Thank you.

900
01:02:15,918 --> 01:02:17,986
For coming back for me.

901
01:02:17,987 --> 01:02:19,653
Of course.

902
01:02:19,654 --> 01:02:23,057
I love you.

903
01:02:23,993 --> 01:02:25,994
I love you, too.

904
01:02:34,670 --> 01:02:38,439
Marley, Tannen is right
over that pass.

905
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:41,441
Okay, now, if we make it there, it's
hot cocoa for real. I promise.

906
01:02:41,442 --> 01:02:44,012
You're serious?

907
01:02:44,013 --> 01:02:47,148
We can't miss
Christmas morning, can we?

908
01:02:49,551 --> 01:02:51,485
Come on.

909
01:03:14,677 --> 01:03:16,912
Charlie?

910
01:03:20,181 --> 01:03:22,884
Is everybody okay?

911
01:03:29,725 --> 01:03:32,261
Cole.

912
01:03:35,297 --> 01:03:38,065
Cole.

913
01:03:56,217 --> 01:03:58,085
What about Cole?

914
01:03:59,188 --> 01:04:01,323
He's gone.

915
01:04:04,293 --> 01:04:07,095
We need to get out of here.

916
01:04:08,998 --> 01:04:10,083
You okay?

917
01:04:10,084 --> 01:04:12,100
Yeah.

918
01:04:34,489 --> 01:04:36,390
Hello? Ben?

919
01:04:36,391 --> 01:04:38,026
Cole?

920
01:04:38,027 --> 01:04:40,228
Hello? Ben?

921
01:04:53,241 --> 01:04:55,476
I can't see a thing.

922
01:04:57,446 --> 01:05:00,014
Come on.

923
01:05:16,397 --> 01:05:20,134
My God, look at that thing.

924
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:29,676
We got to keep moving.

925
01:05:29,677 --> 01:05:32,513
The dynamite is that way and
Gary said that the kids went that way.

926
01:05:32,514 --> 01:05:34,548
So we got to split up.

927
01:05:34,549 --> 01:05:36,617
Well, I'm going to
destroy that thing.

928
01:05:36,618 --> 01:05:39,420
You're going to lose
your evidence.

929
01:05:40,255 --> 01:05:43,325
-I know.
-I'll go after the kids.

930
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:47,462
You're the
explosives expert, anyway.

931
01:05:54,536 --> 01:05:57,606
Try not to blow yourself up.

932
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:03,177
That's funny. It's what
I keep telling Tim.

933
01:06:05,647 --> 01:06:08,150
I'll see you guys in Tannen.

934
01:06:09,518 --> 01:06:11,184
Good luck.

935
01:06:11,185 --> 01:06:13,687
You, too.

936
01:06:17,159 --> 01:06:19,461
Let's go.

937
01:06:30,706 --> 01:06:33,740
Okay, good job guys.

938
01:06:33,741 --> 01:06:36,410
<i>Help, let us in.</i>

939
01:06:36,411 --> 01:06:37,163
Open it.

940
01:06:37,164 --> 01:06:37,879
<i>Okay.</i>

941
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:39,379
<i>Open up.</i>

942
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:40,481
Here he comes. Just a minute.

943
01:06:40,482 --> 01:06:42,384
Okay.

944
01:06:45,686 --> 01:06:48,589
<i>Crystal. Come quick.</i>

945
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:51,659
Crystal.

946
01:06:52,793 --> 01:06:55,196
Watch your step.

947
01:06:57,565 --> 01:06:59,467
Okay, here you go.

948
01:07:01,502 --> 01:07:03,937
Faye.

949
01:07:03,938 --> 01:07:07,508
Marley.

950
01:07:07,509 --> 01:07:11,312
My God, I was so worried.

951
01:07:11,313 --> 01:07:12,646
What happened?

952
01:07:12,647 --> 01:07:14,649
He saved me.

953
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:17,485
Tim saved me.

954
01:07:18,453 --> 01:07:21,422
Where's... Where's Scott?

955
01:07:21,822 --> 01:07:23,158
Mom.

956
01:07:23,159 --> 01:07:25,426
What?

957
01:07:30,565 --> 01:07:32,233
Where... Where's...

958
01:07:32,234 --> 01:07:33,533
Where...

959
01:07:33,534 --> 01:07:35,368
I'm sorry.

960
01:07:35,369 --> 01:07:38,305
No.

961
01:07:38,306 --> 01:07:40,574
I'm sorry.

962
01:07:42,411 --> 01:07:46,581
No. No.

963
01:07:58,726 --> 01:08:00,694
Scott!

964
01:08:02,397 --> 01:08:04,431
Marley.

965
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,302
Tim.

966
01:08:12,907 --> 01:08:15,376
Well, I was hoping for
a white Christmas.

967
01:08:15,377 --> 01:08:16,977
Be careful what you wish for.

968
01:08:16,978 --> 01:08:19,313
Yeah, no kidding.

969
01:08:36,964 --> 01:08:39,033
What do you know about dynamite?

970
01:08:39,034 --> 01:08:41,969
Boom.

971
01:08:48,543 --> 01:08:51,246
Come on.

972
01:09:00,621 --> 01:09:02,757
Marley.

973
01:09:05,526 --> 01:09:08,295
Marley!

974
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:27,549
Scott.

975
01:09:47,835 --> 01:09:49,904
Come on.

976
01:09:52,106 --> 01:09:55,542
I'm here.

977
01:10:14,562 --> 01:10:17,064
You're freezing. Let's
get you in front of the fire.

978
01:10:17,065 --> 01:10:18,899
Okay.

979
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:21,936
Are you okay? Let's warm you up.

980
01:10:27,642 --> 01:10:32,014
-That sounded close.
-Yeah, come on.

981
01:10:32,015 --> 01:10:33,633
-Excuse us, guys.
-Sit here.

982
01:10:33,634 --> 01:10:35,350
Thank you.

983
01:10:54,602 --> 01:10:57,637
-We got to go.
-Not without my gear.

984
01:10:57,638 --> 01:10:58,873
Let's move. Leave it.

985
01:10:58,874 --> 01:11:00,742
Get on! Come on.

986
01:11:00,976 --> 01:11:03,044
Hang on.

987
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:18,058
It's right behind us!

988
01:11:20,027 --> 01:11:22,163
Hand me a stick of dynamite.

989
01:11:22,164 --> 01:11:24,198
Here.

990
01:11:24,199 --> 01:11:25,632
Are you insane?

991
01:11:25,633 --> 01:11:28,502
Yes. Now, throw it.

992
01:11:34,575 --> 01:11:36,444
Did you see that?

993
01:11:36,445 --> 01:11:37,677
It knocked it back.

994
01:11:37,678 --> 01:11:39,681
Hang on.

995
01:11:41,715 --> 01:11:44,619
Grab another one.

996
01:11:51,058 --> 01:11:54,278
-It's working.
-Yes.

997
01:12:03,004 --> 01:12:04,973
We've got this.

998
01:12:06,641 --> 01:12:09,076
Let's go blow up that meteorite.

999
01:12:10,212 --> 01:12:13,080
No!

1000
01:12:14,115 --> 01:12:16,007
The dynamite. What do we do?

1001
01:12:16,008 --> 01:12:18,502
We haul ass.

1002
01:12:20,922 --> 01:12:23,490
<i>It's right behind us. We're
not going to make it.</i>

1003
01:12:23,491 --> 01:12:24,958
What is that?

1004
01:12:24,959 --> 01:12:27,462
<i>I don't know. Just go.</i>

1005
01:12:27,728 --> 01:12:29,597
Hold on.

1006
01:12:40,609 --> 01:12:42,576
Okay.

1007
01:13:07,535 --> 01:13:10,837
Okay, now this is
a magic donkey.

1008
01:13:10,838 --> 01:13:13,172
He is going to keep you safe.

1009
01:13:13,173 --> 01:13:15,509
Okay?

1010
01:13:28,722 --> 01:13:31,124
This is incredible.

1011
01:13:31,125 --> 01:13:33,593
I've never seen
anything like this before.

1012
01:13:33,594 --> 01:13:36,029
Yesterday, this entire area
was covered in snow,

1013
01:13:36,030 --> 01:13:39,600
and the town was
green and now it's reversed.

1014
01:13:39,601 --> 01:13:42,536
There's definitely something
crazy going on.

1015
01:13:47,008 --> 01:13:48,844
Crap, Charlie, look at that.

1016
01:13:48,845 --> 01:13:49,879
What?

1017
01:13:52,914 --> 01:13:55,917
<i>Something is affecting
the storm.</i>

1018
01:14:02,891 --> 01:14:04,026
The meteor.

1019
01:14:04,027 --> 01:14:05,124
What about it?

1020
01:14:05,125 --> 01:14:07,360
My son said he saw the meteor split
in two before it hit town.

1021
01:14:07,361 --> 01:14:10,230
He said one of the pieces was
headed in this direction.

1022
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:14,035
Right.

1023
01:14:14,803 --> 01:14:16,669
I saw this weird heat shift

1024
01:14:16,670 --> 01:14:18,739
when I was tracking
the meteor through space.

1025
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:21,842
One piece gives off
uncontrollable cold, the other heat.

1026
01:14:21,843 --> 01:14:24,345
Together they make up a
normal meteor, but split them apart...

1027
01:14:24,346 --> 01:14:26,946
We are screwed.

1028
01:14:26,947 --> 01:14:29,551
We got to get them
back together again.

1029
01:14:30,285 --> 01:14:32,554
What are you doing?

1030
01:14:34,955 --> 01:14:37,124
I'm finding that missing piece.

1031
01:14:56,844 --> 01:14:58,713
<i>Look.</i>

1032
01:15:03,118 --> 01:15:05,285
We're trapped.

1033
01:15:30,779 --> 01:15:33,880
That's a strange crater.

1034
01:15:36,051 --> 01:15:38,217
If elves could show up on
flying reindeer right now,

1035
01:15:38,218 --> 01:15:41,154
it would be the
strangest thing I'd seen today.

1036
01:15:41,155 --> 01:15:42,273
Shouldn't we...

1037
01:15:42,274 --> 01:15:43,356
Shouldn't we what?

1038
01:15:43,357 --> 01:15:46,793
This isn't an archaeological expedition.
Let's get it and go.

1039
01:15:48,429 --> 01:15:51,065
-Hot?
-Yeah, it's a little toasty.

1040
01:15:54,302 --> 01:15:55,737
These gloves are heat resistant.

1041
01:15:55,738 --> 01:15:57,136
That's more than a little heat.

1042
01:15:57,137 --> 01:16:00,040
How are we
going to transport it?

1043
01:16:04,344 --> 01:16:06,213
That should help.

1044
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,355
That's amazing.

1045
01:16:47,755 --> 01:16:50,191
Take a look.

1046
01:17:01,770 --> 01:17:04,004
It's okay.

1047
01:17:09,076 --> 01:17:11,944
# Jingle bells Jingle bells #

1048
01:17:11,945 --> 01:17:14,448
# Jingle all the way #

1049
01:17:14,449 --> 01:17:17,284
# What fun It is to ride #

1050
01:17:17,285 --> 01:17:20,486
# In a one horse
Open sleigh, hey #

1051
01:17:20,487 --> 01:17:23,356
# Jingle bells Jingle bells #

1052
01:17:23,357 --> 01:17:26,293
# Jingle all the way #

1053
01:17:28,929 --> 01:17:29,864
Hey, you good?

1054
01:17:29,865 --> 01:17:31,732
Yeah, okay.

1055
01:17:44,078 --> 01:17:46,147
<i>It's huge.</i>

1056
01:17:52,286 --> 01:17:54,422
Right. There it is.

1057
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:05,031
Okay, now be careful.

1058
01:18:05,032 --> 01:18:07,802
I plan on it.

1059
01:18:16,210 --> 01:18:18,979
Wait.

1060
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:21,515
<i>No one's going to believe me.</i>

1061
01:18:21,516 --> 01:18:24,450
This is the scientific
discovery of the century

1062
01:18:24,451 --> 01:18:27,921
and no one's
going to believe me.

1063
01:18:27,922 --> 01:18:30,489
Well, if it's any consolation,
I believe you.

1064
01:18:30,490 --> 01:18:33,226
Just think, you've done enough
good deeds for the day

1065
01:18:33,227 --> 01:18:37,230
that you won't be on Santa's
naughty list for the rest of your life.

1066
01:18:37,231 --> 01:18:39,099
You should get out of here.

1067
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:41,334
Are you kidding? I'm not
going to miss this.

1068
01:18:49,944 --> 01:18:51,846
Merry Christmas.

1069
01:19:10,964 --> 01:19:12,967
<i>It's stuck.</i>

1070
01:19:13,433 --> 01:19:15,335
Charlie.

1071
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:28,148
I'm stuck.

1072
01:20:33,213 --> 01:20:35,114
Alex.

1073
01:20:35,115 --> 01:20:37,284
Hey, are you okay?

1074
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:40,453
Okay.

1075
01:20:40,454 --> 01:20:43,389
Are you okay?

1076
01:20:54,602 --> 01:20:56,636
We need to get out of here.

1077
01:20:56,637 --> 01:20:58,940
Come on.

1078
01:21:09,484 --> 01:21:12,253
How did this happen?

1079
01:21:22,129 --> 01:21:23,396
Marley.

1080
01:21:23,397 --> 01:21:25,999
Dad.

1081
01:21:30,038 --> 01:21:31,256
Ben.

1082
01:21:31,257 --> 01:21:32,439
Crystal.

1083
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:35,042
Mr. Crooge.

1084
01:21:35,043 --> 01:21:39,112
Did you see my dad out there?

1085
01:21:42,482 --> 01:21:44,517
We were together for a while.

1086
01:21:44,518 --> 01:21:47,655
We split up.

1087
01:22:02,637 --> 01:22:05,106
Dad.

1088
01:22:17,552 --> 01:22:19,686
Dad. It's Dad. It's him.

1089
01:22:19,687 --> 01:22:22,423
<i>Dad.</i>

1090
01:22:24,124 --> 01:22:25,493
Are you okay?

1091
01:22:25,494 --> 01:22:26,827
I'm fine, fine.

1092
01:22:26,828 --> 01:22:28,694
This is Alex, the scientist
I told you about.

1093
01:22:28,695 --> 01:22:31,530
This is my son, Tim, and Faye.

1094
01:22:31,531 --> 01:22:33,601
Hi. Nice to meet you.

1095
01:22:38,338 --> 01:22:40,239
Ben.

1096
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:42,641
It's good to see you.

1097
01:22:42,642 --> 01:22:44,811
You, too.
