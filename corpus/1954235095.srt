1
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:26,597
So, Yuki, over there on
the other side, all right?

2
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:29,868
This is it, O.
This is it, bro.

3
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:31,408
It's almost time.

4
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:34,172
Yes, it is. Your dreams
are finally coming true.

5
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:37,579
Yeah, man. I grew up visiting
these comedy clubs with my dad,

6
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:40,277
and I always wanted something
like that for myself one day.

7
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,978
I mean, not a club but,
you know, a lounge,

8
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,248
with music and comedy.

9
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:44,617
The whole experience.

10
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:45,917
That's exactly what
we're going to give them.

11
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,959
The whole experience,
and then some.

12
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:50,517
That's right.

13
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,028
You know, this is
one of those times

14
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,964
you just need to stop,
breathe it in.

15
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:57,160
Yeah. Never forget
this moment,

16
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,294
because it never gets
any sweeter.

17
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,100
Hey, hey, he)'-

18
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,504
Hey, POP-

19
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,768
How you feeling?

20
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,867
You cutting it close.
You open this weekend.

21
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:08,037
Yeah, but we almost there.
All right.

22
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,672
The legendary Nate Rider.
Sir.

23
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,808
They ain't killed me yet,
son.

24
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:14,510
You know, my father
went to see you

25
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,077
when you opened up for Eddie
Murphy's first world tour.

26
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:19,054
Yeah, that was a time
when I was a young thoroughbred.

27
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,614
Now I'm an old fart.

28
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,286
They try to put my old behind
out to pasture.

29
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:25,295
Yeah, well, you know,
everyone needs to move on

30
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:27,160
to the next stage in life
eventually.

31
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,200
Oh, okay. Well, you tell me
when you get there

32
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,201
to that "moving on" stage,
because right now

33
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,737
I'm just at the next level
of my life, man.

34
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:35,932
It's a sweet level when
you're old enough to enjoy life.

35
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:37,497
Dad.

36
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:38,838
Son.

37
00:01:38,898 --> 00:01:40,002
Oh, you know what?

38
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,239
You ought to let me
open up for you, man.

39
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,805
A few nights a week. You know,
I'll bring the crowd in, dawg.

40
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,111
You know, look, Dad,

41
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,243
we're kind of going
with a different crowd.

42
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,652
You know, a younger,
chic business thing.

43
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,180
Okay. See, that's a clue

44
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:56,090
that you youngsters,
you think you know something.

45
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:57,560
But you don't know
nothing!

46
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,221
I've got a degree
in Marketing,

47
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,855
a graduate degree
from Yale,

48
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,729
and I just resigned
as VP of Marketing

49
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,928
in the number one urban
clothing line in the world.

50
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:08,336
Whoo! And what that got to do
with a gin and tonic, son? Huh?

51
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:10,067
No, no, I'm serious.

52
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,440
I have learned more
in the back alleys of Memphis

53
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:15,139
than you can any day
in some shirt-and-tie mortuary.

54
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,044
An office job
is not a mortuary.

55
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:18,673
Further proof
you know nothing.

56
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,411
Dad, time to go.

57
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,009
Hey, just trying
to help you out.

58
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,110
Oh, by the way, son,

59
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,587
y'all need some
crushed velvet curtains

60
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,089
and some lava lamps.

61
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,625
Too shiny.

62
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:32,695
Oh, man. They don't make them
like that anymore.

63
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:34,026
You can say that again.
Yeah.

64
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:35,930
Oh, hey, boss.
Don't forget.

65
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,696
We got those talent auditions
lined up for tomorrow.

66
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,794
Oh, 'Ecol.

67
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:42,396
Yeah, this place
is gonna combine

68
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,703
East Coast swagger
with L.A. style.

69
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,573
Yeah. I can't wait.

70
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:55,684
Stop it!

71
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,153
I don't know why you act
like you don't like it, girl.

72
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,190
Ticklish! Stop!
You can't get away from me.

73
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,858
You only run
because you like to get caught.

74
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:06,762
Oh, I run because you like
to chase.

75
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:12,796
Ew. Mm-mm.
You are sweaty.

76
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,099
Go shower.

77
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,731
When did you get so prissy?
You used to like sweat.

78
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,776
Yeah, I mean, there's the sweat
that you make,

79
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:21,107
and then there's the sweat
that we make.

80
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:23,238
I prefer the latter.

81
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:26,648
Intellectually stimulating
and sexually elusive.

82
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:31,417
Sex on the brain.

83
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:34,014
Oh, come on, girl.
You know I love you.

84
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,923
Yeah, you know sex
is not love.

85
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,256
No, no, it's not.

86
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:40,423
But you bring the sexy
out of me.

87
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:41,931
Oh, do I? Okay.

88
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,865
Which reminds me.

89
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,966
How do you like your dress
for this weekend?

90
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:53,272
Um, yeah, that--
That's cute.

91
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,212
It's shiny, but I already know
what I'm wearing this weekend.

92
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:59,011
Yeah, but babe, it's just,
you know, important for people

93
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,552
to see someone beautiful
every time you walk in.

94
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:05,556
Okay, now, I know I agreed
to help host this,

95
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,216
but it's a one-time thing.

96
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,850
You can get some little
college kid

97
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,792
to wear this little
itty-bitty dress.

98
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,126
Yeah, but I asked you
to do it.

99
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:16,429
Yeah, and I'm happy to,
but for opening night only.

100
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:19,732
Shanice, you know how important
this is to me.

101
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,601
If I can't
count on you now,

102
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:22,867
how can I count on you
when we get married?

103
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:23,999
Married?
Yes.

104
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:25,736
Whoa.
Married.

105
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,505
You know,
I proposed to you.

106
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:30,241
And I said no.

107
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:31,839
And I know you didn't
mean it.

108
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:33,281
Baby, you proposed to me

109
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,046
after we dated
for less than three months.

110
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,178
Of course I meant it.

111
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,688
And now?
And now...

112
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:41,851
we are still in the process
of getting to know each other.

113
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:43,552
And I know you enough
to know

114
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,289
you were meant for me.

115
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:51,258
Okay. Now, when we do
get married in the far,

116
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:54,862
distant, far future,

117
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,567
trust me, you will be able
to count on me, okay?

118
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,701
But for now, I mean,
I have a full-time job

119
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,507
and my acting career.

120
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,309
You're a 30-year-old
no-name, no-résumé actress

121
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,079
who wants to quit her job
and chase some pipe dream.

122
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,054
I mean, babe,
you have an amazing job, okay?

123
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,680
The rest of your time
should be focused

124
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,520
on helping me
build an empire.

125
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,753
I mean, isn't that what
every woman dreams?

126
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,659
So let me
get this straight.

127
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:21,892
My dreams are supposed
to be your dreams.

128
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:23,490
Yeah, pretty much.

129
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,832
You're crazy.

130
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,202
Every king needs a queen.

131
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,537
Todd, I have my own dreams
and aspirations,

132
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,507
and acting is one of them.
You know that.

133
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,977
Baby, if you can't be with me
in the valley

134
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,536
when I'm starting out,

135
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:39,208
why do I need you
when I'm on the mountaintop?

136
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,820
That was profound.

137
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,855
But really, maybe you should
deal with what's going on

138
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:47,255
right here and right now
for once.

139
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:49,156
You know what?
Come to think of it,

140
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:51,593
maybe you don't even
need me in your life.

141
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,257
Especially since you can't even
seem to support my dreams.

142
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,765
Well, I would
if they were realistic.

143
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,358
Realistic?

144
00:05:57,423 --> 00:06:00,233
So you're saying your dreams
are more realistic than mine?

145
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:03,069
Obviously. I mean, I don't see
Tyler or Spielberg calling.

146
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,339
Wait, okay, you're overreacting.
No, you know what?

147
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,540
Truthfully, I haven't
reacted enough.

148
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,810
You're constantly trying
to control me and put me down.

149
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,852
I'm not trying to control you.
And degrade me.

150
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:17,649
And manipulate me with your
little condescending ideologies.

151
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,018
Well, you know what?

152
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:21,649
Good luck, okay,
with your dreams, Todd.

153
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,591
See you at the mountaintop.

154
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,329
Shanice. Come on--

155
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,764
Shanice.

156
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:38,837
Hey, man, it's an emergency.
Why don't you answer your phone?

157
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,343
I was in the shower.

158
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,970
Go put on
some damn clothes.

159
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,172
What?

160
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,647
Come on, man.

161
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,588
Hey, Shari, baby.

162
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,557
Hey, look, I'm not playing
with you girl, okay?

163
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,094
I'm not playing-

164
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,823
I didn't mean anything
about it, baby. I just-

165
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,661
I just felt like
you needed to know, that's all.

166
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,792
Baby, look, I'm a man,
so, you know,

167
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:05,802
I'm going to stink
sometimes.

168
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,862
I mean, the point is
I can't live without you, okay?

169
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:12,307
Baby, look, you got me
on my knees over here, okay?

170
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,003
Come on, now.
Men don't do this.

171
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,068
Men don't beg like this.

172
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,880
Baby, look--

173
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,145
Baby, look, I can't be
without you, girl.

174
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,915
I can't. You got me over here
at my boy's crib

175
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:27,082
crying like I'm in some kind
of soap opera.

176
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:29,148
Hey, you want
a little Lenny?

177
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,717
I'll Lenny for you.

178
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,126
Yeah, baby,
I'll Lenny for you.

179
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,858
You know I'll Lenny for you,
baby, anytime.

180
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,991
♪ I love you, girl ♪

181
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:38,763
J" I love you ♪

182
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,566
I don't care how much
you beg!

183
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,628
I will never
come back to you,

184
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:45,676
and you're going to miss me
before I miss you!

185
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:48,075
You know what? I was getting
tired of her butt anyway.

186
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,478
What happened?

187
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:52,482
Oh, man, things were going
so good, man.

188
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:53,949
They were going.
The loving was great.

189
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,576
She cooks, she cleans.

190
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,177
Do you have any idea
how hard it is

191
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:00,622
to find a good woman who will
do a brother's crusty feet?

192
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,489
I haven't found one.

193
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,687
She just had one little thing
that bothered me, man.

194
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,252
Just one little thing.
What?

195
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,696
Look, if I tell you this

196
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:09,699
you got to promise
not to wear me out about it.

197
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:11,598
I promise, man.
What's up?

198
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,034
It's embarrassing, man.

199
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:17,768
You know, sometimes
she had a little odor.

200
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,968
What kind of odor?

201
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,910
Well, you know,
it was like a female odor.

202
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,572
She stinks?

203
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:26,173
Sometimes, you know? But usually
I can put up with it.

204
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,549
Oh, man. Today, man,
she just had a tail of funk

205
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,110
just dragging behind her.

206
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,780
Oh, my gosh, man.

207
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,551
Have you ever smelled
something so bad

208
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:35,957
that it literally hurts you
to smell it?

209
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,551
No, I'm serious.
Like, it physically hurt.

210
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:38,925
Like you were trapped
in some kind

211
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,295
of Korean military torture
chamber or something.

212
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,765
Just...

213
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:45,302
Good grief, man.
I couldn't take it.

214
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,668
I had to say something, man.
Oh, J, you didn't say something.

215
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:50,367
Well, the hell I did, man.
I couldn't suffer anymore.

216
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:53,308
No, J, you can never
say something to a woman

217
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,176
about something she can't change
or won't change.

218
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:57,873
Her hair, her skin,
her weight.

219
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:59,382
Her funk?
I can't tell her she stink?

220
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,111
No!
I can't say,

221
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:03,653
"Baby, your smell
slightly offends me"?

222
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,746
No.
Okay-

223
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:07,119
I'm not even allowed
to be offended then.

224
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,659
She can be offended
by things I say, things I do,

225
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:10,989
but me, I can't.

226
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,496
There's no going back
after that.

227
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,999
You know, I just don't
understand how this is my fault.

228
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,126
You know, nobody should ever
have to tell you

229
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,430
to wipe your butt.

230
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,768
Jamal--
No, I'm serious, man.

231
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,602
It's the first thing
that happens to you in life.

232
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:25,540
Your mama feeds you
and then she wipes your butt.

233
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:28,078
Yeah, man, but sometimes
it doesn't matter how much

234
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,613
a woman takes a shower.

235
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,012
It's genetic.
Well, if it's genetic,

236
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,606
her mama need
to put her up.

237
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:35,084
I'm serious, man. Pass her down
some herbs or something.

238
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,814
Or tell her about
the family secret.

239
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,321
Man, quit laughing, man.
This ain't funny.

240
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:40,357
I needed you
two hours ago.

241
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,792
Oh, man. I was--
I was having my own drama.

242
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:45,089
What, with Shanice?

243
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,290
Yeah, man.

244
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:48,730
It's over.

245
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,131
Yeah, it's over.

246
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,328
It's hitting me a little harder
than I expected, too.

247
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,337
I'm sorry, man.
She was a good girl, man,

248
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:55,872
but not without
her issues.

249
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,306
Trying to be all
Kerry Washington and everything

250
00:09:58,364 --> 00:09:59,468
at age 30.

251
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,307
She needs to be trying
to hold down a job, man.

252
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,074
It's hard out here.
That was my point.

253
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,978
But the woman is holding on
to the pipe dream

254
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:06,107
with a kung fu grip.

255
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,583
You a good guy, though.

256
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,085
I told you about messing
with them actresses.

257
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:11,246
There's only one
exception,

258
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,653
and that's Halle Berry.

259
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,248
She patient like that.

260
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,520
Try to do the right thing.

261
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,061
Get married, settle down.

262
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,619
Come on, man.
These women can't cook.

263
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:21,722
They can't clean. They try way
too hard to be a man.

264
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,824
Man, that's what
I'm talking about, man.

265
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,129
I mean, look,
check this out.

266
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,534
Corporate America is filled

267
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,833
with almost 10 times more black
female executives than men.

268
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:30,464
That's true.

269
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:32,770
I mean, look at them.
"I'm having power lunches."

270
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:34,140
"I'm taking meetings."

271
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,113
Do you know that Shanice
had the audacity to tell me

272
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,807
that she wouldn't
drive a minivan

273
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,214
if we got married
and had kids?

274
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:41,376
What's she going
to drive then?

275
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,113
Told me I can drive.

276
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,052
A shame.
A damn shame.

277
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,852
You know what it is?
It's demonic.

278
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,949
The boy toys,
the boy shorts.

279
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:50,392
What are those, anyway?

280
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:51,723
It's like these women
want exactly that:

281
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:52,728
a human-sized toy.

282
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,526
That pays the bills.

283
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,396
Man, you know what
I should do?

284
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:57,729
I know what you should do.

285
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,098
You should get the biggest,

286
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,263
baddest piece of arm candy
you can, dawg,

287
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,931
and just call it a day.

288
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,202
I'm telling you, just--
You're too high-strung.

289
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:08,245
Just, you know, just date.
Have some fun.

290
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,576
No, no, no.
See, that's too simple, man.

291
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:13,139
Yeah, yeah, I set my goals
too short

292
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:14,878
and my eyes too small.

293
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,079
I'm missing vision.
Vision. Okay.

294
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,121
Creativity.
Creativity.

295
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,554
Aggression.
I like aggression.

296
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,888
It's going to be a fever pitch.
It's going to be a what?

297
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,187
Yeah, forget that.

298
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:26,162
I was the one who was antiquated
small-minded and simple.

299
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:29,631
Well, you did propose to four
different women in four years.

300
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,693
Exactly. So maybe these women
had it right all along.

301
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:35,967
Uh, no, you just need
to slow your butt down, okay?

302
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,498
See, you the kind of dude
that you enjoy all this foreplay

303
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:40,873
but you bail
right before the climax.

304
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,607
No, no, the problem was
none of these women were ready.

305
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,910
I'm going to spread
my love around.

306
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:49,612
Be selfish for once.
Enjoy planting my seed. Yeah.

307
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:51,245
Well, now you just sound
like you're full of yourself.

308
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,221
You know what? You got to change
with the times, bro.

309
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,156
My dad always said a woman
would do no more or no less

310
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,591
than what you allow her
to do.

311
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,720
Wasn't your daddy a pimp?

312
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:01,788
I was looking for an angel
when I really needed both, man.

313
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:04,130
I needed an angel and a devil.
Sugar and spice.

314
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,396
Okay, so you're trying
to date two women.

315
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:08,064
Three, four, five of them.

316
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,164
See, this is where you always
mess up in the end, man.

317
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,231
You're greedy.
Why can't I have it all?

318
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,300
You can't have it all.
Nobody has it all.

319
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,470
No, bro, I want it all.

320
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:16,808
If I can't have it all
with one woman,

321
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,871
I'm going to find it
in however many women I can.

322
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,884
Todd, these compulsive
habits you have,

323
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,248
they're not healthy, bro.

324
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,720
They're not, all right?
You are a serial monogamist.

325
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:25,983
Not anymore.

326
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,547
Maybe you need
a thick woman.

327
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:30,594
See, a thick woman
would work with you, all right?

328
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,754
And every man needs a woman
that will scrape the dead skin

329
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,263
from his feet.

330
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,765
And that cooks.

331
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,095
And takes care of you
like a baby.

332
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,533
"Where are you,
little shnookums?

333
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,002
Little shnookums,
come here."

334
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:41,800
And that doesn't ask
for too much.

335
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,636
Right. Just a little loving.
Two minutes and I'm out.

336
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:46,142
Just a little marathon.
Just a jog around the block.

337
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:47,768
Hey, and if you're lucky,
you might even find one

338
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:48,971
who'll do all the work
for you.

339
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,775
See, I want one like that.
Yeah.

340
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:52,838
Yeah, some arm candy.
A vixen. A cougar.

341
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,215
Yeah, man, I'm about to bust
this game wide open, baby.

342
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,652
Okay, now remember,
men have been found as roadkill

343
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,316
on the side of roads for trying
to pull off something like that.

344
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,154
It's beast time.

345
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,784
Mufasa, calm down.

346
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:06,056
The beach is that way.

347
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,893
You've been looking at yourself
in the mirror a lot.

348
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,296
I can--
I can really tell.

349
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,028
I can't take this, man.
Seriously.

350
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,661
You left your phone.
You left your phone.

351
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:16,704
I'm about to get it, buddy.
You don't understand.

352
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,105
I'm spreading
this loving around.

353
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,746
All right, O, the talent has got
to be top-notch.

354
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,251
I got you, boss.

355
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,445
All right, man.

356
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:31,010
Oh, I'm meeting with
the suppliers later on,

357
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,749
so I'm going to need your eyes
for the audition.

358
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,382
Hey, don't worry about nothing.
I got your back.

359
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:35,652
Cool.
All right.

360
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:37,057
All right.

361
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,722
Hi. I'm here for the hosting
position.

362
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:41,526
Oh, yes, of course.

363
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,032
I'm Todd, the owner.

364
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:44,590
Hi.

365
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,695
Give me a second.
Let me get some chairs.

366
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,137
Hey, how you doing?

367
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,602
All right, there you go.
Thank you.

368
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,112
All right, all right.

369
00:13:57,803 --> 00:13:59,783
My name is Kierra White,

370
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,048
and I'm a recent
college graduate.

371
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:04,746
And I'm just looking
for something

372
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,084
at night and on
the weekends

373
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:08,455
while I finish my internship
at St. Mary's.

374
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,891
Pre-med?
Yes.

375
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,895
Neurology.
Very impressive.

376
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,088
Are you going to review
my résumé?

377
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,600
I will in a moment. I just want
to get a feel for you.

378
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,966
Okay.

379
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,062
So, what do you like to do
in your spare time?

380
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:25,597
Well, I run.

381
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:27,644
I write poetry.

382
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,476
And I volunteer
at the homeless shelter.

383
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,812
Oh, you're just
a little angel, huh?

384
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,785
I'm just trying to do my part.
To give back.

385
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:36,819
And humble, too.

386
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,856
Thank you.

387
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:41,585
I just want
to be clear on something.

388
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,183
Here at the Water Lounge,

389
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,820
we don't just want the average
nightclub vibe, you know?

390
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,262
We want people to walk in

391
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:50,163
and feel like they've had
an experience.

392
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,101
So when it comes to the hostess,
she must be beautiful.

393
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:56,901
But beyond that, graceful.
Statement-worthy.

394
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,999
I understand.

395
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,543
Do you?
Yes.

396
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,579
Like that 1940s grace.

397
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,581
When women used to stop
traffic.

398
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:05,945
Yeah, that's it.

399
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,643
And men wore suits,

400
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,242
and ladies always seemed
to have a dress on.

401
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,982
Yeah. So wise
beyond your years.

402
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:15,091
All right,
so let me just--

403
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:17,991
Let me make sure I got this
all in the right order.

404
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,552
You're hired, I'm hoping that
you're free tonight for dinner,

405
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:22,428
and I'll cook it
right here.

406
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,161
No, it's just dinner.

407
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:25,497
With you?

408
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:26,729
Yes.

409
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:29,295
Well, see, I like to get to know
my staff...

410
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,339
intimately.

411
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:33,934
Okay.

412
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,501
7:30'?

413
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,046
Sure.

414
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,046
Okay.

415
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:42,652
Kierra White.

416
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:48,350
I think I just found
an angel.

417
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,018
Yeah.

418
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:53,393
Hey, boss, I know it may not
be my place to say,

419
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,331
but, you know, one thing my pops
always told me:

420
00:15:56,388 --> 00:16:00,063
whatever you do,
never crap where you eat.

421
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,537
And this applies to me how?

422
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,631
I mean, do you think it's cool
to be messing around

423
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,005
with one of your
employees?

424
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:09,012
Trust me, we're just going
to have a little fun.

425
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,638
Hmm.

426
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:13,274
Yeah, that's the same thing
Clarence Thomas said.

427
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:22,555
So the Brown Betties, huh?

428
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:27,359
Yeah, I like your style
and I definitely like your look.

429
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,126
But, you know,
just keep in mind

430
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:30,758
here at my club,

431
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,030
we're going to keep it
growing and sexy.

432
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,936
So let me see
what y'all working with.

433
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,294
Yeah.

434
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,315
Squeeze it.
There it is.

435
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,294
Okay.

436
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:13,665
That was nice.

437
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:15,796
Real nice.

438
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:18,068
You know, but, you know,
let me think about it.

439
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,804
I'll get back with you.

440
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:24,507
And I'll let you know
if you got the job or not.

441
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,844
Enjoy your day, ladies.

442
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:27,008
Thank you.
Thanks.

443
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,609
All right. Yeah.

444
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,120
Get a load of Marliss.

445
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,281
The Brown Betties.

446
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:34,847
Yeah.

447
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,589
Next.

448
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,472
Can he walk any slower?

449
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,011
Ooh, he going to break
my damn stage.

450
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,981
All right, so,
what's going on, man?

451
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:00,175
How you feeling?

452
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:04,648
So, what's your name?

453
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,018
Call me Tiko.

454
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,853
So, what you going to do
for us today?

455
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:11,016
I'm going to wow you,
player.

456
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,494
Okay.

457
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:13,894
Go ahead.

458
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,989
I ain't going to be here
too long,

459
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:19,297
because I got my Smart car
out there double-parked.

460
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:23,365
But you look familiar.

461
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,203
You look like
my first son's father.

462
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,369
You look just like him.

463
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:29,844
Bernard?

464
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:30,937
No.

465
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,279
Oh, she told me

466
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,817
none of them kids was mine.

467
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,614
I'm sure taking care
of them.

468
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:40,020
Anyway, I'm down
to my last Fruit Roll-Ups.

469
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:45,293
But it's good to be here.

470
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:49,765
It's kind of fancy.
Got a lot of curtains.

471
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:52,995
You best be doing something
besides pimping.

472
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:56,767
And I used to pimp.
I was pimping ho's.

473
00:19:56,828 --> 00:20:00,071
But my last ho
got hit by a bus,

474
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:04,410
and ain't nobody banging
no crippled coochie, goddang.

475
00:20:04,469 --> 00:20:07,643
So I'm just here

476
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,346
trying to find another way
to make some money,

477
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:11,979
because the damn
parole officer

478
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,081
is not going to want to know
about yesterday.

479
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,285
Talking about I got
two more weeks.

480
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,726
He's going to take me
back again.

481
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:20,923
And again, ain't nowhere
for no pimp,

482
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,556
you know what I'm saying?

483
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,532
I was in there for a while.

484
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,764
I was sending them young boys
to them big boys.

485
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,271
You know,
it got out of hand,

486
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:32,605
because them big boys
was getting real rude.

487
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:35,645
I told them five boxes
of cigarettes.

488
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:36,907
They want to come
with one.

489
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,448
And I said,

490
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:41,040
"You ain't getting my best
little young ho over here.

491
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:42,676
"He a good boy.

492
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,948
I ain't going to let you
go like that, Jezebel."

493
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,114
That was his name.

494
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,351
Boy, I did a white room.
It was Ku Klux Klan.

495
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,087
Everything was cool
until my hood came off.

496
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:55,331
It ain't really like that.

497
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,264
It ain't really
like that at all.

498
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,199
I think some people
shouldn't wear church clothes

499
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,532
if they don't bathe.

500
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:02,731
I mean, I was sitting
by this one brother,

501
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,068
he was funky as hell.

502
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:06,302
I said, "Holy Spirit ain't going
to get up in you,

503
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,606
"because your stink
is the scene.

504
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,978
Your stink is the scene."

505
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:14,884
Knock, knock.

506
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,783
Who's there?

507
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,219
VD.

508
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:23,184
VD? All right, VD.
On that note--

509
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:24,818
No, no. VD who?

510
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,385
VD who?

511
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,794
Hell, you got VD?

512
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:29,264
You better find out
who you got it from.

513
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:33,233
All right, well,
check this out, man.

514
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,101
I'll give you a call
in a couple of days

515
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,605
and let you know
if you got the job.

516
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,664
You know, I got to think about
some things first.

517
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,903
Where you gonna call, man?
I ain't gave you no damn number.

518
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,810
Oh, don't worry about that.
You know, we'll contact you.

519
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,815
Well, these black lounges,

520
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,282
they don't
tell the truth.

521
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,216
You sound like you ain't gonna
book my ass,

522
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:52,517
and you're going to regret it
when I get on Arsenio Hall,

523
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,386
if he ever get back
on TV.

524
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:55,891
All right.

525
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:58,359
All right, bro.

526
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,192
He funny, though.

527
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:04,734
You got to get this stage fixed
before I come up here.

528
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,963
I don't want to be making
no trapdoor.

529
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:11,138
Oh, man.

530
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:12,573
Okay.

531
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:16,740
I'm glad his act
was faster than his exit.

532
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:19,373
Next.

533
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:20,883
Oh, boy.

534
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,943
Oh, this is nice.

535
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,920
Yeah, I could tear it up
in here.

536
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:28,981
I definitely- Yeah, I can
definitely do it up in here.

537
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:30,287
When do I start?

538
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,761
Uh, hey, hold on.

539
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:34,559
First of all
you got to audition.

540
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,621
Audition?
Yeah. Audition.

541
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,003
I haven't auditioned
for nothing in years.

542
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:42,038
Like, people just book me.

543
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:44,301
Yeah, I know you might
be popular somewhere else,

544
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,535
but I don't know you.

545
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:46,940
Who are you?
What's your name?

546
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:48,534
Tiffany.

547
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,045
Okay, so what are you
gonna do for us?

548
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:51,308
I tell jokes.

549
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,816
Well, make me laugh.

550
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,182
I grew up-- I grew up
in South Central L.A.

551
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:57,686
My grandma raised me.

552
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,313
You know, she taught me
how to be a woman.

553
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,619
She taught me how to value
myself as a woman.

554
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,785
I'll never forget it.
It was my 18th birthday.

555
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,328
And I really wish she would
have told me this

556
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,761
on my 16th birthday,

557
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,798
because at that point I had been
ridden out the property already,

558
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,128
if you know what I mean.

559
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:12,099
But she pulled me to the side
and she said...

560
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,729
Look here, baby girl.

561
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,570
Now that you become
a woman,

562
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,803
there's a certain way
you need to think of yourself.

563
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,174
And every woman,

564
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,145
every woman should
think of herself this way.

565
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:27,672
Baby, I want you to think
of yourself as a house.

566
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,650
And there's one thing
you got to remember, baby.

567
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:33,315
Every man wants to come
inside your house.

568
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:34,721
But you can't be having
all kind of men

569
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,088
going in and out your house
all the time,

570
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:38,094
because that bring
your property value low.

571
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,925
Mess around and be known
as the crack house,

572
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,464
and you don't want
to be the crack house.

573
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,090
You want to keep the grass cut
and keep it clean,

574
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,657
because you don't want people
walking by thinking

575
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,202
you got an abandoned house,
see here?

576
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,465
And you don't want to be going
out late at night getting drunk,

577
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,700
because somebody will
break into your house, baby.

578
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,605
Right through the back door.
Break in right through the back.

579
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:54,701
And that'll have you walking
messed up the next day,

580
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:55,972
talking to the police.

581
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:58,913
And she said, Once you find
a man that loves you

582
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,278
and cares about you,

583
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:02,079
he'll go ahead and he'll sign
that paperwork,

584
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,610
he'll put a ring on your finger
and he will buy that house.

585
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,088
And I just want to know
by a round of applause

586
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:09,318
how many ladies are here tonight
got them a husband,

587
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,554
a.k.a., homeowner.

588
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,562
Yeah.

589
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,620
Nobody?

590
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:18,167
Well, dang, so all y'all
just renting your house,

591
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,965
or just section 8-ing
the property out?

592
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,164
Rent it out.

593
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:24,798
Got some Mexican family of 15
living in there,

594
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,308
trying to make ends meet.

595
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:29,538
Okay, okay.
Cut, cut, cut. Hold it.

596
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:32,013
That was horrible,
all right?

597
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,640
Look, I don't know where
you got your jokes from,

598
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:35,582
but you need to take them back
where you got them from,

599
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,176
because that sucked.

600
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:39,119
Your grandmother told you
about the house.

601
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:40,918
Your grandmother should have
told you

602
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,720
to get you a new
occupation,

603
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:44,317
because that was not good.

604
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:46,328
Now, if you could just
get up off my stage, please--

605
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:47,795
Well, you know what?

606
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,855
Your little bald head
is not good, Okay?

607
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:51,559
Why don't you get
some Ovation hair therapy

608
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:52,966
and grow your hairline
back in.

609
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:54,196
Please just exit.

610
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,170
Oh, I can't believe you.

611
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:57,866
All right, well,
you have a nice day.

612
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:05,705
I knew it.

613
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,772
Yup, yup, yup.
I knew it.

614
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,512
You knew what?

615
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:11,053
I knew you would come back
to your senses

616
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:12,383
and come running back
to me.

617
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:14,082
Boy, please.

618
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:15,715
Do I look like
I'm running back to you?

619
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,726
Yeah, well,
then why are you here?

620
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:19,819
I just...

621
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:23,362
I just wanted
to give you these.

622
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,805
I forgot you had these.

623
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,203
Yeah.

624
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:34,907
So I don't know
if you realize,

625
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:39,472
but today is one week away
from our six-month anniversary.

626
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,108
Six months, huh?

627
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:43,152
YUP-

628
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:47,884
Well, you know, time flies
when you're having fun.

629
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:53,121
Okay, Todd, I don't want
to play games with you.

630
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:55,755
I really don't.
I love you.

631
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,992
You don't love me.

632
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,159
If you loved me
you would have married me.

633
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,327
But it's all good.

634
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,836
Hey, your loss
is someone else's gain.

635
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,633
You are so stubborn.

636
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:03,968
And so are you.

637
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:05,337
I mean, do you know
how many women

638
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,842
would pray to be
with a man like me?

639
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:10,505
Well, you know what they say.
Be careful what you ask for.

640
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,810
Oh, it's like that?

641
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:15,181
I guess so.

642
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,947
Well, hey,

643
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:18,783
you know, I got
stuff to do, so...

644
00:26:20,612 --> 00:26:21,989
Todd.

645
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,321
Take care.

646
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:35,296
Ow, girl.

647
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:43,168
Oh, boy.

648
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:48,209
What the...? Where these
instruments come from?

649
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,186
Oh, this should
be interesting.

650
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,582
Next.

651
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,687
What the heck?

652
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,927
Does he have on pink fur?

653
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:08,970
Hey, hey, hey.
How you doing, man?

654
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:11,063
Hello.

655
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,234
Okay, what's your name?

656
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,209
Dream Catcher.

657
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:16,870
Dream Catcher? Okay.

658
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,471
So...

659
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:21,107
So what you going
to do for us today?

660
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,684
I'm going to do
a little jingle.

661
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:27,189
Okay. Go ahead.

662
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:29,247
You ready?

663
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,555
Band!

664
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:35,655
This song's about
Leah Parker.

665
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,597
She broke my heart,
you know.

666
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,034
Took all I had.

667
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,834
He's not wasting my...

668
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:48,241
I didn't know
what to say back then.

669
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,076
But now I do.

670
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:58,648

Dream Catcher, Dream Snatcher,
whatever, man.

688
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:47,030
Just please just spare me.

689
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,231
You know what you need
to do, man?

690
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:52,366
Just take that act and go on
back to Harvard with it.

691
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,841
So when do I go on?

692
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,571
Never.

693
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:56,805
Ever.

694
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,108
That means
you like the song.

695
00:28:58,169 --> 00:28:59,648
"Choke, Choke, Choke."

696
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:01,012
I'm gonna choke,
choke, choke you out of my club

697
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,449
if you don't get off my stage
right now.

698
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:03,918
Please.

699
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:08,048
Right.

700
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:12,962
Bring security out here.
Who--?

701
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:14,155
Security!

702
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,130
Who let him in here?

703
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:30,742
Wow, this is so nice.

704
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:32,804
Welcome.

705
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:35,147
Did you cook this
yourself?

706
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:36,708
Of course.

707
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,221
There's a Cajun shrimp
fettuccine warming

708
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,814
while we eat our blue lump
crab cakes.

709
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,851
And to drink,
I've got a 1975 chardonnay.

710
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:48,397
Please, taste it to see
if it's to your liking.

711
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:56,300
That was pretty good.

712
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:58,136
I don't normally
drink wine,

713
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:00,039
but when I do it's Moscato.

714
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:01,372
Do you have any sugar?

715
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:04,140
Uh, yes, yes.

716
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:05,306
Um, I do.

717
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,872
Give me one second.

718
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:14,416
There you go.
Thank you.

719
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,617
All right.

720
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,670
Now that's much better.
Almost like Moscato.

721
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:39,271
Oh, yeah.
Well, you know,

722
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:42,079
Moscato is really
a dessert wine.

723
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,178
Chardonnay is meant to be
a little dry.

724
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:49,714
Also, may I suggest that you
hold the glass by the stem,

725
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:52,762
so the oil from your fingertips
don't taint the wine.

726
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:54,626
And don't drink.

727
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:59,032
Let the wine
massage your taste buds.

728
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,070
Let it slide
into your mouth.

729
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:11,243
You're right. It's like you can
feel the wine sinking in.

730
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:12,542
Exactly.

731
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:13,878
May I

732
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:16,350
Oh, absolutely. Yeah.

733
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:26,387
It's delicious.

734
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:28,260
It's delectable.

735
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,595
It's like eating sin.

736
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,999
I like how you put that.

737
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:36,066
Mmm.

738
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:38,767
Mmm. I love this piece.

739
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,867
It's the old soul.

740
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:42,172
Do you dance?

741
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,678
I love to dance.

742
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,214
Oh, shall we?

743
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:48,411
All right.

744
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:52,645
We're not dancing to this,
are we?

745
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,087
Oh, well, did you have
something else in mind?

746
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:55,886
Can I plug in my iPod?

747
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:58,086
Sure, sure. Yeah.

748
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:05,629
This is my tape.

749
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:08,668
Whoo!

750
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:12,768
All right.

751
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,970
You can't handle me.
You can't handle me.

752
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,605
Yeah , well ,
you're probably right.

753
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,048
Okay, all right.
That was fun.

754
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,948
That was great.

755
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:26,712
That was so invigorating.

756
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:30,191
Oh, I'm so glad you're not
one of those stiff shirts.

757
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:31,852
You know,
the old fogey type.

758
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,623
Uh-huh.

759
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:36,165
Because I'm young.
I want to be free, you know?

760
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,824
Enjoy my youth.

761
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,698
No commitment.

762
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:41,395
No strings.

763
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,441
How does that feel?

764
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:53,505
Oh, it feels amazing.

765
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:55,812
My boyfriend loves
my massages.

766
00:32:55,873 --> 00:32:57,546
You have a boyfriend?

767
00:32:57,608 --> 00:32:58,951
Several.

768
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,183
It's funny how life works.

769
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:03,225
Wait, how do you have
more than one boyfriend?

770
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:06,285
I asked myself long ago:

771
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:09,855
Kierra, how are you going
to heal the world

772
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,923
if you're only loving
one man?

773
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,368
So now I spread my love
all over the world.

774
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:17,133
Spread your love all over
the world?

775
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,732
Yes. France.

776
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:21,708
Milan.

777
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:23,507
India.

778
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:25,206
India?

779
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:28,375
Well, that wasn't
till my parents cut me off.

780
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:30,749
Life is so funny.

781
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,810
I was born,
and then I walk in

782
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:34,379
and I find my candy.

783
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:36,447
Candy?

784
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:40,690
You know, I think my mom
calls them sugar daddies.

785
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:44,290
That's what she said my dad was
before they got married.

786
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,801
Look, I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

787
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:50,101
I love that you're
so wise.

788
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:53,675
So refined.

789
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,577
You just lay there.

790
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:00,547
I don't mind working
for what I get.

791
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:03,279
Kierra, you know,
I don't really--

792
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:06,811
I know every single thing
about the male anatomy.

793
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:20,227
Hey, it's looking nice
in here, man.

794
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:21,599
Yeah, we getting there.

795
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,161
One more day
till we open.

796
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,672
So, where you hiding her?

797
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,538
Who?
The angel, man.

798
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:28,133
I didn't come all the way
down here to see you.

799
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,906
She is not here, man.
Thank God.

800
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:31,310
That doesn't sound like
happiness.

801
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,508
Man, she will not stop
calling me.

802
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,414
And I put new brakes
on her car,

803
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:36,884
I paid her light bill,

804
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:38,648
I keep filling up
her tank.

805
00:34:38,709 --> 00:34:40,154
You tricking.
She can't be that fine.

806
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:41,622
Man, she is.

807
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,716
Man, she is.
But that's not the point, man.

808
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:45,522
She is wearing me out.

809
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,085
Well, take it out
of her pay.

810
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:49,529
I can't. She's depending
on that money to pay her rent.

811
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:50,827
Look, I don't understand
what's going on here.

812
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:52,458
I just know she got to go.

813
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:54,434
No, man. I can't get rid of her,
because I'm her boss as well.

814
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:55,664
It's just not that simple.

815
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,171
Ooh, you got a lawsuit
happening.

816
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:59,105
You got a lawsuit happening.
You got to get out of this.

817
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:00,665
But that's on you.
I'll be here tomorrow,

818
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:02,802
and you'd better have my VIP.
I got your table, man.

819
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,710
You got a lawsuit happening.
There ain't a lawsuit.

820
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,113
It ain't tricking if you got it,
and obviously I got it.

821
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:08,912
Watch them getting out
of the curtain.

822
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:14,523
Right this way, baby.
Right this way.

823
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,585
Yes, I'm Jamal Hartford.

824
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:20,094
I have a VIP reservation.

825
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:24,357
I'm sorry.
I don't have you down.

826
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:26,265
No, that must be a mistake.

827
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:28,201
I'm a dear, personal friend
of the owner.

828
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:31,468
I understand.
I mean, most everyone here is.

829
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:34,976
But the VIP is reserved
for our most prestigious guests.

830
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:38,874
Do you remember me?

831
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:40,643
Should I?

832
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:43,481
Well, I did a little Hostess
commercial back in the day.

833
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,248
I don't remember.

834
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,720
It was about '95.

835
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:48,313
I was 8 then.

836
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:49,858
What?

837
00:35:49,914 --> 00:35:51,552
I'm sorry.

838
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:52,959
We don't have to start
with the "I'm sorry."

839
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:54,360
Kierra, I got it.
Yes.

840
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:57,592
This is Kierra? Oh, hell, no.
She got to go, man.

841
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,191
Jamal.
That's disrespectful!

842
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:00,759
Jamal, be cool.
Just be cool.

843
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,964
All right, all right, all right.
Baby, I'm so sorry about that.

844
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:05,007
Can you go freshen up
for a little bit, baby?

845
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:07,702
All right, that's cool.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

846
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:10,240
Todd, where is my VIP?

847
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:11,871
Come on, bro.
Am I not your brother, man?

848
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:13,244
Your table's over here.
Come on.

849
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:16,774
♪ Had a man like me ♪

850
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:20,050

855
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:33,658
Always flapping your gums.
That's more like it, man.

856
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:35,226
Hang me out there
looking like a scrub.

857
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:36,567
I got you covered.
Chill.

858
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:40,671
Man. Tonight is real success
for you though, brother.

859
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:42,472
Yeah. Thanks, man.
You know.

860
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,535
No, you really knocked
this one out of the park.

861
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:47,173
Yeah, but you know, it's easy
to blow out opening night.

862
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:49,582
Now, to keep it packed every
night, that's the challenge.

863
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,314
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Look at this cougar over here.

864
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,117
Mm-mm-mm.

865
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:57,125
See, she is lucky
I am not here alone.

866
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:59,058
She's looking at me.

867
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:02,298
No, she's clearly
looking at me.

868
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:04,765
Hey, baby, how you doing?
Ooh, you smell so good.

869
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:06,927
We are VIP.
Our table is right over there.

870
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:08,436
Why don't you go
hold us down.

871
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:10,802
My goodness.
Yeah, right?

872
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:12,067
Brother, she had it tonight.

873
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:13,608
She had it tonight,
because I'm working on

874
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:15,735
a little jungle loving
for later.

875
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,871
But that one right there,
I'm warning you:

876
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:19,505
she bites.

877
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,174
I got this.
No, no, no.

878
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,582
I'm not playing with you, Todd.
Seriously.

879
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,085
I'm not bailing you
out of jail.

880
00:37:24,141 --> 00:37:26,246
That one will have you tricking
on a corner. Watch yourself.

881
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,653
Go on, man.

882
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,594
Good evening.
Good evening.

883
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:35,687
May I refresh your drink?

884
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:36,857
Absolutely.

885
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,059
Pinot noir.

886
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:43,869
Tell Omar to pull out
our best bottle.

887
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,771
Right away, Mr. Weber.

888
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,547
I was watching you
while you were on stage.

889
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,049
I just love a young man
in a good suit.

890
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,485
Well, I don't know
how young I am.

891
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:01,989
I didn't mean it to offend you.
It's a compliment.

892
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:05,858
I don't mean young like
a baby lion cub.

893
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:08,954
More young
like a virile lion.

894
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:12,898
Well, you know,
they say we get better with age.

895
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,527
Oh, baby, believe it.

896
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:20,872
I mean, I say it's the blending
of the young

897
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:22,535
and the mature

898
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,137
that bring the fireworks.

899
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:26,681
I'm Linda.

900
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:28,410
Linda. All right.

901
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,644
So, what do you do?

902
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,084
I'm an interior decorator.

903
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,213
I work for high-end
companies.

904
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:35,848
Athletes, celebrities,
superstars.

905
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:37,290
All right, well,
in that case

906
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:39,589
what do you think
about the place?

907
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,186
It's nice.

908
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,926
It definitely could use
a woman's touch.

909
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,195
But...

910
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:50,103
add drapes on the walls,
add some layers.

911
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,334
Maybe candles
on the bar.

912
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:54,603
Anything with some bling.

913
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:55,837
Bling?

914
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,937
Ladies love sparkles,
baby.

915
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,045
Well, it must be nice
to use your skills

916
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:02,584
in very creative ways.

917
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,247
Well, I guess it is

918
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,950
an interesting way
to satisfy myself.

919
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,617
How so?

920
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:13,355
I always get what I want.

921
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:18,964
My clients trust me
implicitly.

922
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,696
So when it comes
to my designs,

923
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:23,034
I always get what I want
there too.

924
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:25,938
That must ring true
in your personal life too.

925
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:28,033
Why don't you
call me tonight...

926
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:31,546
and find out.

927
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:47,820
Shanice? What are you
doing here?

928
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,525
Well, I promised you
I'd be here for the opening.

929
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:52,067
And I'm here.

930
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:53,466
Who's this?

931
00:39:53,524 --> 00:39:55,697
This is Robert.
He's one of the ministers

932
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,398
down at my church.

933
00:39:57,461 --> 00:40:00,135
Uh-huh, How you doing,
Robert?

934
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:01,540
I'm great.

935
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,840
This is a very nice place
you have here.

936
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,574
Much success to you.

937
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:07,047
Shanice, I'm a little
surprised

938
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:08,447
you were bringing
the good reverend

939
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:10,782
to a lounge.
Oh, we won't be staying.

940
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,821
Sorry, brother.
I was talking to Shanice.

941
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:15,289
I just wanted
to congratulate you.

942
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,994
Robert, do you mind?
I'll be right out.

943
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,427
Not at all...

944
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:22,759
Todd.

945
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,891
Robert.

946
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:27,094
Why do you have to act
so silly?

947
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:28,569
What you talking about,
acting silly?

948
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:30,333
You want to bring some man
up into my establishment.

949
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:31,771
I was on my way
to church.

950
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:33,934
I just wanted
to wish you success.

951
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:35,136
Church, huh?

952
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,440
Yeah. The place you refuse
to take me.

953
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:40,038
Shanice, I don't have to go
to church to be a good man.

954
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,481
No, you don't.

955
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:44,383
But the man that I want
and the man that I'll have will.

956
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,580
Oh, like Robert?

957
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:48,952
Yeah, okay.

958
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:50,287
This is enough.

959
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:52,520
I want you to have
a good night.

960
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,790
I know you'll do well.

961
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,388
Wait...

962
00:40:58,189 --> 00:40:59,463
I miss you.

963
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:01,503
Yeah, I miss you too.

964
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,903
But I think
this is for the best.

965
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,440
Says who?

966
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,175
Have a good night, okay?

967
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,627
What y'all doing here?

968
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:28,823
Work out, when I ran
into Hostess boy here

969
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:30,388
out in the street.

970
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:32,092
That's funny, Mr. Ryder,

971
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,692
because I did that commercial,
like, 20 years ago.

972
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:36,431
I wish you remember
it was, like, 20 years ago.

973
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,565
You know, people don't forget
child stars.

974
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,108
Boy, you weren't no star.

975
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,507
You did one commercial,
and all you did

976
00:41:41,565 --> 00:41:43,044
was shove a Twinkie
in your mouth.

977
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,943
I had an agent.

978
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,413
What are you doing?

979
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,744
I'm here to borrow
your golf clubs.

980
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:48,943
You don't play golf.

981
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,280
I don't need to know
how to play.

982
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,844
I just need to look good
standing by the clubhouse.

983
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,618
I got my eye
on that long money.

984
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,750
Them white women gonna make this
boy scrub they floors.

985
00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:59,886
You lack vision and conviction.

986
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,258
Whatever.

987
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:02,353
What them?

988
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:03,864
Baby, I've got to get
this car.

989
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,298
Hello, everyone.

990
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,699
How you doing?
How you doing?

991
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:08,100
Baby, I needed gas money,

992
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:10,502
so I grabbed a 50
out of your wallet.

993
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:14,708
Caught himself a dairy farm.

994
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:15,903
A dairy farm?

995
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:17,274
Yeah, you getting
milked.

996
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:18,870
Ha-ha-ha,
that's very funny.

997
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:20,643
Whatever. Look, the golf clubs
are in the closet.

998
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,479
And, Pop, you still haven't told
me why you're here.

999
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,781
Oh, I'm here to talk some sense
into you, boy.

1000
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:25,946
Okay, okay, yes, yes.

1001
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,455
Y'all did pretty good
this weekend.

1002
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:28,785
But I'm telling you, son,

1003
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:30,120
I'm going to take you out
to a whole new level.

1004
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,091
Come on, Dad. I don't have time
for this right now.

1005
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:34,151
You guys really need to go.
I got some--

1006
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,788
We just got here.

1007
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:37,389
Linda.
Hey, honey.

1008
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:39,832
I brought this back for you
from the other night.

1009
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,597
I had it cleaned.

1010
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,764
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

1011
00:42:43,827 --> 00:42:47,001
This is Jamal,
and this is my dad, Nate.

1012
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,510
Nate Ryder.
Your dad?

1013
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,308
You're a comedian, right?
Yeah, that's what they tell me.

1014
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:54,941
Wow. I was a huge fan of yours
back in your heyday.

1015
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:59,147
Ah, well, I'm sure you had
some fans too in your heyday.

1016
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:00,517
I still do all right.

1017
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,921
Yeah, you do.

1018
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:04,983
Well, anyway,
this is for you.

1019
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:06,323
I got to run.
Got an appointment.

1020
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:07,657
Good day, gentlemen.

1021
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:08,662
HEY-

1022
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,096
Thank you, baby.
I got you.

1023
00:43:10,154 --> 00:43:11,895
Son, you ain't right.
Man, you got kids and cougars

1024
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:13,264
running all throughout
this place.

1025
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:14,598
Look here,
little Twinkie boy,

1026
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:16,433
why don't you leave
so grown folk can talk?

1027
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:17,699
They don't make Twinkies
anymore,

1028
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,001
but I got a Ding Dong
for you.

1029
00:43:19,063 --> 00:43:20,269
Catch you later.

1030
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:21,605
All right.

1031
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:23,611
Say, Pop, you know,
I don't think the lounge

1032
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:25,044
is going to be the right place
for you.

1033
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,514
All right, fine.
We'll discuss the lounge later.

1034
00:43:27,571 --> 00:43:30,142
Why do you have so many women
running in and out your place

1035
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:31,618
like you some black
Howard Hughes?

1036
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:33,052
I'm just enjoying
being single.

1037
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,282
Son, where's Shanice?

1038
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:35,949
Pop, Shanice is old news.

1039
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:38,550
And she's starting to date
her minister from her church.

1040
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,323
But I have moved on

1041
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:42,591
to a plethora of opportunity
that abounds.

1042
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:47,300
Only a fool basks
in his foolery.

1043
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:50,339
But, Pop, come on, now.
You were a legendary player.

1044
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:52,670
And that's not something
that I am proud of, son.

1045
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:56,837
Listen, listen. Yes, all right?
Yes, I was out on the street.

1046
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,743
But your mama still raised you
in church, boy.

1047
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,180
I mean, I-- Lord knows
I treated every woman wrong,

1048
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:04,481
but I thank God
she kept praying for me.

1049
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:07,317
Look, I still want
to get married, I do.

1050
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:10,222
Just not now. I mean, right now
I want to focus on me.

1051
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,350
My business.

1052
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:13,122
And enjoy all these
beautiful women.

1053
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,890
Uh-huh. You still think you're
going to find a good woman

1054
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:16,829
after you done slept with
everything from here to L.A.?

1055
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:20,699
Huh? Once you done laid up
like some used-up sponge

1056
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:22,533
somebody down found
under the sink, you really--

1057
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:24,664
You really think
that you still going to find

1058
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:26,230
that same good woman,
son, huh?

1059
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:27,741
Don't you think the reason
so much happened

1060
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:29,300
between you and Mom was because
you didn't get a chance

1061
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:31,812
to scratch that itch
before you got married?

1062
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:33,542
Scratch that itch!

1063
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:36,851
Son, I could have ho'ed
for another 20 years

1064
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:39,148
before I finished
scratching that itch.

1065
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:40,552
Listen, listen, listen.

1066
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:44,519
Everything that you are

1067
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:47,061
and all that
you will become

1068
00:44:47,117 --> 00:44:49,961
is written by the choices
that you make.

1069
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:53,991
Unfortunately,
I did a whole lot of scratching

1070
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:55,696
before I met your mama.

1071
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:57,534
No, I got this.

1072
00:44:57,594 --> 00:44:58,572
Okay.

1073
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:00,631
I hope you got it.

1074
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:04,544
Because when I think about
all the years that I...

1075
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:07,240
I missed with your mother,

1076
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:09,807
and when I was finally
able to, you know,

1077
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,716
get it right and ready,

1078
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:13,186
it was too late.

1079
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,119
I love you, son.

1080
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:20,628
And I don't want you to make
the same mistake that I made.

1081
00:45:22,686 --> 00:45:24,529
Yeah. I hear you, Pop.

1082
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:26,295
And I love you, too.
But...

1083
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:29,368
I'm not sure.

1084
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,705
I've said my piece.

1085
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:38,502
All right, don't forget me
and the club.

1086
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,173
Lounge.
Oh, whatever.

1087
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:42,678
I'll bring the heat, son.

1088
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,651
Have them jiggling Bambi.
I know you will.

1089
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:46,415
All right.

1090
00:45:57,955 --> 00:46:00,435
You know we don't
do this here.

1091
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:03,131
I just miss you so much.

1092
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:05,605
I saw you
two nights ago.

1093
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:09,132
I know, but I really wanted
to see you last night.

1094
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:10,610
Yeah , well ,
I was busy.

1095
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:14,205
Daddy, I need an advance
on my paycheck.

1096
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,306
What?

1097
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:17,215
I just need a little one.

1098
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,880
Look, Kierra, there are no more
checks to advance.

1099
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:22,048
You're already
into your next one.

1100
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:25,525
Well, maybe you can go
into your private stash.

1101
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:26,788
Cut it out.

1102
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:30,657
Oh. I see.

1103
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:33,167
You got what you want,
so now I'm expendable.

1104
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:34,861
I left my other boyfriends
for you.

1105
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:37,929
I didn't ask you to.
Hell, I'd prefer you didn't.

1106
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:39,133
Let them chip in.

1107
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:41,934
I see what's going on.

1108
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:43,444
You want a beautiful woman,

1109
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,377
but you don't want
to pay the cost to keep her.

1110
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:47,108
The cost?

1111
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:48,980
Okay, look,

1112
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:50,712
what happens
in this place of business

1113
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:53,414
is completely separate
from what happens outside.

1114
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,754
Oh. You want to keep it
separate.

1115
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,385
Yes. No more advances.

1116
00:47:00,784 --> 00:47:02,320
I understand completely.

1117
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:04,423
So, since you're my man,

1118
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:07,662
I'll expect my rent check later
on tonight when I come over,

1119
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:10,261
because my boss
is being a real jerk.

1120
00:47:18,936 --> 00:47:20,244
Everything all right, boss?

1121
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:23,444
No. That damn Kierra's
about to drive me crazy.

1122
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,145
And our numbers here
have been down

1123
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:26,381
for the last
couple of weeks.

1124
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:28,081
Yeah, I noticed.

1125
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:29,453
We've got to change that
quickly,

1126
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,288
or else this is going
to be the shortest trip

1127
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,691
from success
to failure ever.

1128
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:35,093
Maybe we need to sex it up
a little bit.

1129
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:36,756
What do you mean?

1130
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:38,356
I mean, you know,
make it a place

1131
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:39,833
where the fellas
want to come to, you know?

1132
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:42,564
Hire some sexy waitresses,
fix the back room up,

1133
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:44,537
make it into
an exclusive VIP.

1134
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:47,303
Sounds like you're talking about
making it into a strip club.

1135
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,970
It's only a strip club
if they're stripping.

1136
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:52,138
Sex it up, huh?

1137
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,546
All right.
All right, I'll tell you what.

1138
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:57,518
You help drive in the business,
I'll make you manager

1139
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:00,818
Manager?

1140
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,653
Yeah. I mean, you have just
as much invested in this club

1141
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,715
as I do.

1142
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:06,055
Hey, boss, look,

1143
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:08,118
I promise you
I won't let you down.

1144
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:09,323
I know you won't.

1145
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,990
I'll be in the back
for a while.

1146
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,658
Cool.

1147
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:22,241
Hey. Hey, what's going on,
Shanice?

1148
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:23,471
How you doing, Omar?

1149
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:24,773
I'm looking for Todd.

1150
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:26,508
Oh, he's not in right now.

1151
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,311
Maybe, you know,
I can help you out.

1152
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:29,908
You know what?

1153
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:31,919
I think I need to speak
with Todd.

1154
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:34,819
Well, Todd's not running
the place anymore,

1155
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:36,858
since he's made me manager.

1156
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,689
Really?
Yeah.

1157
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,093
You know, I'm working on
buying him out as we speak.

1158
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:42,459
Wow. That's interesting.

1159
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:44,521
Okay, maybe you can
help me.

1160
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,966
So my sorority is having
its annual get-together,

1161
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:50,130
and I'm thinking this might
be the perfect place.

1162
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:51,365
And I think you're right.

1163
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,736
Yeah, maybe we can have it--

1164
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:55,174
Make it one of those
theme nights.

1165
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:57,303
I like that. Yeah.

1166
00:48:57,367 --> 00:49:00,871
Yeah, yeah.
You know, Shanice,

1167
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,441
you know, I think it's cool that
you're supporting Todd and all.

1168
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:04,815
Look, I know it's not
my place to say,

1169
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:06,377
but sometimes

1170
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:09,117
it's not the effort
that you make,

1171
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:11,455
but where you put it.

1172
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:14,655
I do not follow.
What do you mean?

1173
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:16,959
I mean, why keep dumping money
into an old jalopy

1174
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:20,661
when you can just trade in
for a new model?

1175
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,296
Okay, Omar.

1176
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:27,899
Um, I'm going to have
somebody call

1177
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,309
to make those arrangements.

1178
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,368
Okay.

1179
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:33,472
Business before pleasure,
huh?

1180
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:35,676
Yeah, see you soon.

1181
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:43,085
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

1182
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:47,253
Beautiful people of Chicago
at the Water Lounge tonight.

1183
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:50,264
Give yourselves a round
of applause for coming out, man.

1184
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:52,999
Hope you're drinking.

1185
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:54,831
Drink, drink, drink,
people.

1186
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:57,701
It makes the comedy better.
Drink up.

1187
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,643
Any single parents out there?
Single parents.

1188
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:04,975
Yeah, give it up
for yourselves.

1189
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:07,379
Don't need no man
for nothing.

1190
00:50:07,437 --> 00:50:11,749
Yes, yes. Yes, ladies,
you do need a man for something.

1191
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:14,254
You know, not everything,
but for some things.

1192
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:16,450
And children need a man
in their life.

1193
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:19,050
You know,
I had a stepdad situation.

1194
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:20,356
And when I say stepdad,

1195
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:22,090
I don't mean
my mama wasn't married.

1196
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:24,962
You know, she just went
with the man a long time.

1197
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,024
You know, yeah, yeah.

1198
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:28,899
Y'all go together. That's what
they used to call that.

1199
00:50:28,959 --> 00:50:30,597
Y'all go together.

1200
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:31,798
You don't know where
you're going,

1201
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,569
but you're going together,
you know.

1202
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:34,904
Because you are one,
you know?

1203
00:50:34,965 --> 00:50:36,672
It was my sister's daddy.

1204
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:38,940
And he was a grown
little man.

1205
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:41,141
I don't know if you've ever seen
a grown little man,

1206
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:43,707
but, you know,
they have a Napoleon complex.

1207
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:45,185
He was trying to tell us
to do stuff,

1208
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:46,778
and you'd be like,

1209
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:48,186
"I'm not scared of you."

1210
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:50,589
You know, because we felt like
we could whoop Frank ass.

1211
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:52,923
But...

1212
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:54,929
But he was a grown
little man.

1213
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:58,330
But he had other little issues
that we didn't know about.

1214
00:50:58,388 --> 00:50:59,833
He had like a glass eye.

1215
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,962
And I don't know if you ever
seen nobody with a glass eye,

1216
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:04,369
but it's kind of scary

1217
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:07,671
because the eye don't do stuff
like regular eyes do.

1218
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:10,143
You know, it don't blink
or wink or nothing.

1219
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,873
It just look at you
all the time.

1220
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:13,778
And you're a little kid,
that's kind of scary.

1221
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:16,443
We was like, "Mama, Frank keep
looking at us."

1222
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:19,009
And she was like,
"That man asleep. He asleep."

1223
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,317
And we'd be like, Well, somebody
need to go shut that eye.

1224
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:25,190
Because evidently nobody told it
it was bedtime, you know?

1225
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:28,252
Because it just stayed woke
looking at people.

1226
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:30,389
But we learned
to appreciate the eye.

1227
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:32,161
You know, at least Frank
had an eye,

1228
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:33,895
but he was an angry
little man.

1229
00:51:33,957 --> 00:51:36,198
So one day
he got to arguing

1230
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,205
with the man next door,
named Tummy.

1231
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,740
And Tummy told Frank,
he's like,

1232
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:42,276
"Frank, don't, man.
I'm gonna knock your eye out."

1233
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:43,834
And, you know,
I heard people say that,

1234
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:47,347
but you don't really think
that can happen in real life.

1235
00:51:47,404 --> 00:51:48,610
You can't knock
a whole eye out.

1236
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:51,516
But Frank went out there
and led with the wrong eye.

1237
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:54,647
And he was just hitting him
in the eye.

1238
00:51:54,711 --> 00:51:57,055
And we was like, "Whoa, Frank.
Stop. Stop, Frank."

1239
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,060
And Frank was like,
"I got him, I got him."

1240
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,221
And we were like,
"We can't tell. We can't tell."

1241
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,890
Because that is not
how you have nobody.

1242
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,627
But I got to give
the eye credit.

1243
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:06,827
It was a tough-ass eye.

1244
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:08,494
I don't know where
he got it from.

1245
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:10,060
But we were like,
"Frank, that's a tough-ass eye."

1246
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:13,404
But I guess the eye got tired
and it actually fell out.

1247
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,841
And we were like, "Whoa, he has
knocked out Frank's eye."

1248
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:18,607
And Frank's like,
"Y'all help me find this eye.

1249
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:20,011
Help me find my eye."

1250
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,572
And we was little kids.

1251
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,345
We were like, "Frank, we don't
know what the eye look like

1252
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:24,817
outside the eye."

1253
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:26,616
You know, because you ain't
never just been outside playing

1254
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:28,314
and somebody
drop their eye.

1255
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:30,483
You'd be like, "Whoa, I found
an eye outside, Mommy."

1256
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:32,527
And she'd be like,
"Throw that eye back outside.

1257
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:34,687
Don't bring no eye
in my house."

1258
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:36,128
But...

1259
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:37,529
I thought that was hilarious
right there.

1260
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:39,658
But this is a beautiful thing,
man.

1261
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:42,135
So I'm just happy to be here.
I am really hot.

1262
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:44,968
I'm happy to be in Chicago
at all times.

1263
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:46,530
I moved out to L.A.

1264
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:49,941
Man, L.A. is whole
nother place, you know.

1265
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,604
They got a lot
of Hispanics.

1266
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:54,478
It's really Mexico.
I don't know who says it's L.A.,

1267
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:55,676
because it is Mexico.

1268
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:57,377
I think we are in
their territory.

1269
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,283
Yeah, because, you know,
people would be, like,

1270
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,878
undocumented work bus.

1271
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:03,925
You know, I ain't got no problem
with no undocumented worker.

1272
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,392
You know, I don't have
no paperwork either.

1273
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:07,860
So I don't know.

1274
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:10,526
You know, I'm supposed
to be here every day,

1275
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:13,067
so, yeah, I don't have
no time for it. Nothing.

1276
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:14,625
But, yeah,
because, you know,

1277
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:17,262
people say, you know,
it's like 12 million illegals.

1278
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:20,069
You know, somebody had a clicker
if you know the number.

1279
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:22,440
That's all I'm saying.
Somebody had a clicker.

1280
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:24,775
So they're not illegal.
You know they're here.

1281
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:27,314
So, yeah. You get over a fence,
that's good.

1282
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:30,351
You did good, because, yeah,
if you run from the police

1283
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:31,943
and climb a fence,
that's cool.

1284
00:53:32,008 --> 00:53:33,646
You know,
that's a regular-size fence.

1285
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,054
But Mexican people,
they climb a real fence.

1286
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:37,819
You'd be like,
Man, that was good climb work

1287
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,656
he did right there.

1288
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,127
Yeah, because I can't climb
no fence like that.

1289
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:43,425
I'm going to pull a hamstring.
I already know.

1290
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:44,760
So-- But, yeah.

1291
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:46,630
And I lived in a Mexican
neighborhood.

1292
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:48,465
I liked the Mexicans,
because they work.

1293
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:50,061
They work hard.

1294
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:51,833
But they try
to sell you stuff

1295
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,738
that you did not know
was a big seller.

1296
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:56,573
You know, at the door a lady
tried to sell me some tamales.

1297
00:53:56,633 --> 00:53:58,010
And I told her, I said,

1298
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,105
I don't really eat tamales
at the door, you know?

1299
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:03,413
I usually go into
an establishment...

1300
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:06,245
Yeah.

1301
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:07,845
And I score on the front
of the thing.

1302
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:11,381
You don't even have a score.
I don't know what your score is.

1303
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,320
Thank y'all.
Keep supporting.

1304
00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:28,875
Oh, hey.
Hey.

1305
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,707
You know, I could have
picked you up for dinner.

1306
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:33,247
I know. I just wanted
to do something

1307
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:35,340
a little different
tonight.

1308
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:37,817
You plan on staying
for a while?

1309
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:39,410
No.

1310
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:41,888
I like to bring
my own fun sometimes.

1311
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,947
Ah.

1312
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:45,152
Come here, baby.

1313
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:49,497
You know,
you have been

1314
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:53,056
so loving
and so gentle.

1315
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:57,071
I want you to do just one little
bitty thing for me tonight.

1316
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,004
Oh, yeah? What's that?

1317
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:00,700
Get on your knees.

1318
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:03,303
What?

1319
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:07,847
I said get on your knees,
Peasant.

1320
00:55:09,706 --> 00:55:11,344
Have you lost your mind?

1321
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,349
Woman, you got one
more time to-

1322
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:17,248
Boy, get on your knees.

1323
00:55:43,606 --> 00:55:44,880
What them?

1324
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:46,113
Let me out of here!

1325
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,850
Man, what--
What happened, man?

1326
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:50,414
Linda happened.

1327
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,858
Well, why didn't you
scream for help?

1328
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:55,624
Every time I opened the door,
she'd slap me again.

1329
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:58,256
What kind of freaky...?

1330
00:55:58,321 --> 00:55:59,800
She did things, J.

1331
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:01,631
She did things, man.

1332
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:04,194
I mean, things I just-
I mean, I just...

1333
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,399
This sounds horrible.

1334
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:07,771
It was horrible.

1335
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:09,037
But to be honest...

1336
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:10,874
It's just-- What'?

1337
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:11,912
Spit it out!

1338
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:12,946
I kind of liked it.

1339
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:15,414
You liked it.

1340
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:16,610
Hey, man,
I've never been

1341
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:18,653
in such a place
of eroticism, passion.

1342
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:22,383
You know, psychological torture
mixed with pleasure all in one.

1343
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:24,618
Something is really wrong, Todd.
Yeah, I know.

1344
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:27,059
You need to go back
to Shanice right now.

1345
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:29,063
Shanice?
Yeah, Shanice.

1346
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,928
You're not ready for all these
freaky women out here.

1347
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:32,091
Oh, no. I'm ready.
And you need to go,

1348
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:33,725
because Shanice
is on her way.

1349
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:35,269
Yo, bro,
you are tripping.

1350
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:37,327
Say, look, man,
Shanice had it all, all right?

1351
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,465
Now if she wants to be treated
like a little chick on the side,

1352
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:40,974
that's how I'm going
to treat her.

1353
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:42,668
You need to get your mind
off these women

1354
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,177
and back onto
your business.

1355
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,975
You know, I went down
to your spot a couple days ago.

1356
00:56:46,035 --> 00:56:47,378
I thought I was up
in Magic City.

1357
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:49,007
The only thing missing
was a pole.

1358
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,643
Look, man, I'm just adding a
little sexy flavor to the place.

1359
00:56:51,708 --> 00:56:53,210
Yeah, well,
Omar is making a living

1360
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:54,914
pimping out
that back room.

1361
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:56,013
What?

1362
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,353
Yeah, I saw it
with my own eyes.

1363
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:59,121
I'm here to tell you
you're losing it.

1364
00:56:59,182 --> 00:57:01,219
You got to get it together,
brother.

1365
00:57:01,284 --> 00:57:02,490
I have it together.

1366
00:57:02,552 --> 00:57:04,429
Oh.

1367
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:05,693
You're an addict.

1368
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,428
No, I'm not.

1369
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:08,730
Yes, you are.

1370
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:10,362
You're addicted
to the women, the drama.

1371
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:11,963
You're always looking
for a new high.

1372
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:13,701
Man, You don't know
what you're talking about.

1373
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,367
Yes, I do.

1374
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,105
Man, and I feel bad,

1375
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:19,272
because I'm the one
that encouraged you, too.

1376
00:57:19,335 --> 00:57:20,837
Took me a while
to figure it out.

1377
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:22,212
But look at the pieces.

1378
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:25,412
You proposed to four
different women over four years,

1379
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:27,318
only to break up
with all of them.

1380
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:30,522
Upon further examination,

1381
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:32,218
I've discovered that
they weren't right for me.

1382
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,023
That's not it.

1383
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:36,029
After the initial high
of the proposal,

1384
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:38,292
you felt depleted.

1385
00:57:38,354 --> 00:57:40,834
You had to go look
for a fresh one.

1386
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:42,836
Why would I propose
just to break up?

1387
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:44,735
Because you sick and twisted
like that.

1388
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:47,297
That's why Shanice was trying
to get you to go to church.

1389
00:57:47,363 --> 00:57:51,140
Look, J, save the armchair
psychology, man.

1390
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:53,306
Who better to recognize
an addict than a former one?

1391
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:54,905
You're not an addict.

1392
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:57,110
I was.
Four years clean.

1393
00:57:57,173 --> 00:57:58,914
Don't you think I'd know
if you were a drug addict?

1394
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,352
Who said anything
about drugs?

1395
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:03,084
I was a high roller.
I was a gambling fool.

1396
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,750
What do you think all those
trips to Vegas were about?

1397
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:06,555
Everybody gambles in Vegas.

1398
00:58:06,616 --> 00:58:08,220
No, no, no.
I was online gambling,

1399
00:58:08,284 --> 00:58:10,730
shooting craps in the alley,
the racetrack.

1400
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:12,596
No wonder you were broke.

1401
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:16,501
Trust me, I won just as much
as I lost.

1402
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,904
But every time I did win I was
out looking for that next win.

1403
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:21,408
That next high.

1404
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:22,670
It's a perpetual cycle.

1405
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:24,006
Yeah, well, I'm not in
that perpetual cycle.

1406
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:25,603
Yes, you are.

1407
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:28,114
Look, man,

1408
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:30,378
you know these women
ain't right for you.

1409
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,716
But it's just like gambling.

1410
00:58:32,775 --> 00:58:35,278
You know you gonna lose,
but you still got to play.

1411
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,586
Now do yourself
a favor.

1412
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:40,924
Go to one meeting
and tell me how you feel.

1413
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:43,157
Look, I don't need
some AA meeting.

1414
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,295
Do it for me.

1415
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,927
Fine. I'll think about it
if you leave.

1416
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:51,632
I'll leave, man, but that's not
gonna solve your problems.

1417
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,230
I know. You're right.
You need help.

1418
00:58:53,296 --> 00:58:55,298
Like the professional kind.

1419
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,436
Man, say no to these women!
They drugs!

1420
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,138
Don't inhale!

1421
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:14,257
HEY-
HEY-

1422
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:16,058
Thanks for coming by.

1423
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:18,030
Yeah. Yeah, no problem.

1424
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:22,001
I still don't know why
we had to speak in person.

1425
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:24,595
Well, because I can't do this
over the phone.

1426
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:30,075
Todd, what are you doing?

1427
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:31,635
I can't stop thinking
about you.

1428
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:34,443
I don't think
that we should--

1429
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:35,949
See, that's the problem.

1430
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:39,919
We've been thinking too much
instead of enjoying the moment.

1431
00:59:39,976 --> 00:59:42,616
Enjoying the moment?

1432
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:45,159
Yeah. You know I've realized
that I've been putting

1433
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:47,160
way too much
pressure on you,

1434
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:50,322
and now I'm ready to, you know,
let it flow.

1435
00:59:50,386 --> 00:59:54,266
Todd, it wasn't the pressure.
It was the selfishness.

1436
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:57,464
You're right.
You're right. I was selfish.

1437
00:59:57,527 --> 01:00:00,098
I was selfish.

1438
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:06,006
Wait. No. Mm-mm, no.

1439
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:10,310
Just let me-- I got to go
to the bathroom.

1440
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:12,148
I'm going to be
right back, okay?

1441
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:13,312
Sure.

1442
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:14,684
I'll be back.
Okay.

1443
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:18,451
Got her now.

1444
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:28,431
So...

1445
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:31,801
You're ready to commit?

1446
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:34,068
I am committed.

1447
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,736
Okay. And you'll be satisfied
with just me?

1448
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:39,006
Only me. Nobody else.
Absolutely.

1449
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:40,513
Okay.

1450
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:42,106
Then whose are these?

1451
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:45,811
What“ Those?

1452
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:47,252
Yes, these.

1453
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:48,846
Uh...

1454
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:50,219
I don't know.
I have no idea.

1455
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:51,781
They were in your bathroom.

1456
01:00:53,516 --> 01:00:55,860
Shanice, those are
probably yours.

1457
01:00:55,918 --> 01:00:58,023
You don't think I know
my own drawers?

1458
01:00:58,087 --> 01:00:59,589
Yes. No. I mean...

1459
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,158
So now I'm just a fool.

1460
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:03,170
That's what it is?
Yes. No.

1461
01:01:03,226 --> 01:01:04,830
I mean,
what does it matter?

1462
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:07,875
It matters because I want
someone who loves me, only me.

1463
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:10,604
Not somebody who's going to go
pick up some stray

1464
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,806
two weeks after I'm gone.

1465
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:16,613
Okay, all right.
What about Robert?

1466
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,584
Robert is just a friend,

1467
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:20,587
and I am definitely
not having sex with him.

1468
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:23,021
Hey, look, just because somebody
takes off they panties,

1469
01:01:23,079 --> 01:01:25,753
that don't mean
that we had sex.

1470
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:29,827
Now you really just think
I'm a fool.

1471
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:31,229
That's what that is.

1472
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,232
You're not a fool.

1473
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:36,531
Todd, you're single.
You are free.

1474
01:01:36,592 --> 01:01:37,764
Why lie?

1475
01:01:37,827 --> 01:01:39,306
Own it.

1476
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:42,705
All right,
all right, look.

1477
01:01:42,765 --> 01:01:44,039
Okay, look,
let me explain.

1478
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:45,602
I can't.
I can't even believe

1479
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:49,241
that I was still trying
to support you.

1480
01:01:52,075 --> 01:01:53,816
What do you mean?

1481
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,514
You'll see tonight.

1482
01:01:55,578 --> 01:01:58,388
Wow. Oh, my goodness.

1483
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:04,563
Oh, my God.

1484
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:12,637
Linda?

1485
01:02:12,695 --> 01:02:14,641
I thought I told you
not to come by unless--

1486
01:02:14,697 --> 01:02:18,736
Oh, Todd. There's someone
I wanted you to meet.

1487
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:21,774
Who's this?

1488
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:24,341
That's my husband,
Allen.

1489
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:26,683
Your husband?
Yeah.

1490
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,917
I thought it was about time
the two of you guys met.

1491
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:31,959
Pleasure to meet you.

1492
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,919
I've heard such delicious things
about you.

1493
01:02:35,985 --> 01:02:37,987
Oh, relax.

1494
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:39,533
We're not staying.

1495
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:41,091
Not now.

1496
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:43,034
I just thought maybe
it was best

1497
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:44,594
that the two of you
meet now.

1498
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:46,833
You know,
before later on tonight.

1499
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:50,741
I'm looking forward to spending
some more time with you tonight.

1500
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,837
What you mean tonight?

1501
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:56,440
Ooh, the possibilities
are endless.

1502
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:01,278
Until tonight.

1503
01:03:02,378 --> 01:03:04,358
Oh. Thank you, baby.

1504
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:11,924
Say, bro...

1505
01:03:16,692 --> 01:03:19,195
What in the freaky hell...?

1506
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:24,403
Hey, boss. What can I get you?
Nothing. I'm good.

1507
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,242
Where's Kierra?

1508
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:28,543
She's around.

1509
01:03:28,604 --> 01:03:31,016
I see.

1510
01:03:31,073 --> 01:03:32,984
So, do you like
what you see?

1511
01:03:33,042 --> 01:03:35,022
The club is packed.
The register is full.

1512
01:03:35,077 --> 01:03:36,886
We're even turning people
away at the door.

1513
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:38,619
It's not a club.
It's a lounge.

1514
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:40,160
What's up with the music?

1515
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:41,627
Oh, yeah.

1516
01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:43,220
We decided to change it up
a little bit

1517
01:03:43,286 --> 01:03:44,822
to better fit
our clientele.

1518
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:46,423
Hey, everybody.

1519
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,594
I just want to thank
all of my sisters

1520
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:53,073
from the Chicago chapter
of Phi Sigma Beta

1521
01:03:53,129 --> 01:03:54,437
for coming out tonight.

1522
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:57,171
I would to especially like
to thank Mrs. Linda Carter,

1523
01:03:57,233 --> 01:03:58,576
one of our premier members.

1524
01:03:58,634 --> 01:04:00,341
Thank you so much
for coming out.

1525
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:03,475
And also one of our younger
sisters, Miss Kierra White.

1526
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:05,541
Thanks, Kierra.

1527
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:07,246
Oh, last but not least,

1528
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:10,052
I want to thank
Mr. Todd Ryder.

1529
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:12,023
For opening up
his establishment to us.

1530
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:13,890
Thank you, Todd.

1531
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:16,362
You invited Shanice's sorority
in here?

1532
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:17,864
I did.

1533
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,729
They paid $1,500
to use the place.

1534
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:22,429
You let Shanice and Kierra
in the same spot?

1535
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:26,439
I didn't know
they were sorority sisters.

1536
01:04:26,495 --> 01:04:29,374
I'm not paid to keep
your mess straight, all right?

1537
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:31,378
I'm paid to bring in
business.

1538
01:04:33,669 --> 01:04:35,148
O, you're killing me, man.

1539
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:36,911
You are absolutely killing me.
How could you let-J?

1540
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:38,646
And who are the goons,
by the way?

1541
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,814
They're with the gentleman
who's occupying the back room.

1542
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:44,256
Occupy? Who?
One of our regulars.

1543
01:04:44,313 --> 01:04:45,485
We've been open
less than a month, man.

1544
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:46,686
We ain't got no regulars.

1545
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:52,456
He became a regular
when you made me manager.

1546
01:04:52,521 --> 01:04:54,558
Hold on. So you're trying
to tell me

1547
01:04:54,624 --> 01:04:56,001
I can't go into the back room
of my own club?

1548
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:58,368
Lounge. Remember?

1549
01:04:58,427 --> 01:05:00,634
All I'm saying is the gentleman
paid good money, Todd.

1550
01:05:00,696 --> 01:05:02,141
How much?
Your cut is $500.

1551
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:03,438
My cut?
Yeah.

1552
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:05,274
I figure if I'm bringing in
all the business,

1553
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:07,314
then I should get the bulk
of the extra money.

1554
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:09,680
Say, bro, every dime that walks
through that door belongs to me.

1555
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,912
I pay you to be a manager.
That's right.

1556
01:05:11,974 --> 01:05:13,612
To manage.

1557
01:05:13,676 --> 01:05:15,178
Not fill the place up
with customers.

1558
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:18,953
This place was dead.
Remember that?

1559
01:05:19,015 --> 01:05:20,688
You would be bankrupt
by the end of next month

1560
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,821
if it wasn't for me.

1561
01:05:25,154 --> 01:05:27,259
You know what, man?

1562
01:05:30,726 --> 01:05:31,864
We're here as planned.

1563
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,669
This party is great.
Yeah, it's interesting.

1564
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:35,367
I didn't know
it was happening.

1565
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:36,876
Surprise.

1566
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,140
I just love to support
the men in my life.

1567
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:42,172
And your husband too?

1568
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:43,842
Of course.

1569
01:05:43,906 --> 01:05:46,182
Besides, I couldn't let Linda
have all the fun.

1570
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:50,357
Congratulations
on all your success.

1571
01:05:50,413 --> 01:05:52,518
I guess she was right.

1572
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:54,987
You do know how to handle
your business.

1573
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:57,031
Okay, look, I don't know
what kind of crazy,

1574
01:05:57,086 --> 01:05:59,589
freaky stuff y'all into,
but I'm not interested, okay?

1575
01:05:59,655 --> 01:06:00,827
I wasn't raised that way.

1576
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:02,665
Well, don't knock it
till you try it.

1577
01:06:02,725 --> 01:06:03,931
Hey, hey-

1578
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:05,370
You's feisty
like I like it.

1579
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:07,237
Look, I'm serious.
Y'all should leave.

1580
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:08,604
Okay?

1581
01:06:08,664 --> 01:06:11,008
Take that little Sodom and
Gomorrah damnation with you.

1582
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:13,813
This looks cozy.

1583
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:15,143
How do you know Linda.

1584
01:06:15,204 --> 01:06:16,877
We met a few weeks ago.

1585
01:06:16,939 --> 01:06:18,179
He's a fun one.

1586
01:06:19,575 --> 01:06:20,918
Fun?

1587
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:23,423
Fun.

1588
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,220
Excuse me--
Excuse me for a moment.

1589
01:06:25,281 --> 01:06:26,988
Take your time.

1590
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:31,564
What is going on?
Hey, man, who is that?

1591
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:34,533
That's a guest of the person
who's using the back room.

1592
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:38,231
Okay, O, this is it, man.
It's over.

1593
01:06:38,294 --> 01:06:39,864
What?
It's over.

1594
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:42,307
Tell Devo to get his boy
and bounce.

1595
01:06:42,365 --> 01:06:43,844
Can't do that.

1596
01:06:43,899 --> 01:06:45,879
Yes, you can.
Tell him now.

1597
01:06:48,704 --> 01:06:51,082
I won't do that.

1598
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,448
Who are you talking to?

1599
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:53,680
I'm talking to you.

1600
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:56,519
You see,
you got me twisted.

1601
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:58,991
Look around, boss man.

1602
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:01,358
This is my club now.

1603
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:04,159
Your ass is just visiting.

1604
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:06,222
Okay, let me tell you
something.

1605
01:07:06,288 --> 01:07:08,859
You think because you 6'4"
with a bald head

1606
01:07:08,924 --> 01:07:11,962
and a pink shirt that I won't--
Hi, baby.

1607
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,439
What the hell
are you doing?

1608
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:15,066
I'm on my break.

1609
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:16,576
Doing what?

1610
01:07:16,632 --> 01:07:18,839
I'm off the clock,
remember?

1611
01:07:18,901 --> 01:07:21,347
And whatever happens here
is completely separate

1612
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:23,577
from what happens
outside of here.

1613
01:07:27,843 --> 01:07:30,687
There he is.
My man Viggo.

1614
01:07:30,746 --> 01:07:31,952
What's up, baby?

1615
01:07:32,014 --> 01:07:34,961
I like your little lounge
you got going here.

1616
01:07:35,017 --> 01:07:36,553
Hey, listen,
I want to thank you personally

1617
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:37,996
for that little thing
you set up for me.

1618
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:40,933
Mmm, that girl was all
you said she would be.

1619
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:42,333
Hey, the pleasure's mine,
Mr. Styles.

1620
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:44,098
Thank you.
Yes, sir.

1621
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:48,040
Kierra, you know that's not
the last time, right?

1622
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:49,337
I got plans for--

1623
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:50,775
Hey, man.

1624
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:52,244
Oh, do me a favor.

1625
01:07:52,301 --> 01:07:54,542
Why don't you get me a bottle
of your finest champagne

1626
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:55,911
and pour my ladies
another round.

1627
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:58,611
And make sure it's cold, boy.
All right?

1628
01:08:04,046 --> 01:08:06,287
I'll be damned.
Hold up, man.

1629
01:08:06,348 --> 01:08:07,884
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, man. Move, man!

1630
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:09,190
Hey!

1631
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:17,802
Man, what in God's name
happened to you?

1632
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:19,271
Oh, man, it was crazy.

1633
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:21,808
Omar was pimping.
Kierra was ho'ing.

1634
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:25,505
My club was turning into
the Bunny Ranch of Chicago.

1635
01:08:25,568 --> 01:08:27,809
I told you.
Save your "I told you so's."

1636
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:29,372
I just got to figure out
what I'm going to do

1637
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:30,644
about my business.

1638
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:32,344
I hate to admit it,

1639
01:08:32,408 --> 01:08:35,480
but I was going under before
Omar started managing, you know?

1640
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:37,319
I might be shut down.

1641
01:08:37,379 --> 01:08:38,824
Man, this is not about
your business.

1642
01:08:38,881 --> 01:08:40,053
This is about you.

1643
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,687
You start making better
decisions about your life,

1644
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:45,288
you start making better
decisions about your business.

1645
01:08:45,354 --> 01:08:47,300
Yeah, maybe you're right.

1646
01:08:47,356 --> 01:08:48,858
I know I'm right.

1647
01:08:48,924 --> 01:08:50,904
When is that next
meeting again?

1648
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,031
Tomorrow night.

1649
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:56,040
I'll be there.

1650
01:08:56,098 --> 01:08:57,702
Good.

1651
01:08:57,766 --> 01:08:59,473
And afterwards, I'm gonna teach
you how to fight,

1652
01:08:59,535 --> 01:09:01,071
because you got
your butt beat.

1653
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:02,343
Hey, man,
there was like three.

1654
01:09:02,404 --> 01:09:03,747
Oh, really?

1655
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,410
Actually there was one, two,
three, four, five.

1656
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:07,044
Five of them.
Why didn't you run? You're fast.

1657
01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:08,679
What you mean run, man?
I ain't gonna run.

1658
01:09:08,744 --> 01:09:10,485
Hey, I did--
Where were you at?

1659
01:09:10,546 --> 01:09:11,991
You were supposed
to be my boy.

1660
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:14,459
I was not being where you were
and getting my butt beaten.

1661
01:09:19,755 --> 01:09:22,326
I'm never really sure
how the day is going to end.

1662
01:09:22,391 --> 01:09:25,668
Will I take a drink
or won't I?

1663
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:28,641
Every time I want
to take a drink,

1664
01:09:28,697 --> 01:09:30,370
I remember that little girl

1665
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:32,935
lying in the streets
with her baby doll.

1666
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:34,913
Though I'm not the one
who hit her,

1667
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:36,847
her blood's still
on my hands,

1668
01:09:36,906 --> 01:09:39,819
because every time I got behind
that wheel drunk,

1669
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:43,413
I just keep thinking
it could have been me.

1670
01:09:44,647 --> 01:09:47,127
I could have murdered
that little girl.

1671
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:51,021
She haunts me.

1672
01:09:55,758 --> 01:09:57,237
One day at a time.

1673
01:09:57,293 --> 01:09:59,796
One day at a time.
One day at a time.

1674
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:03,105
Would anybody else
like to share?

1675
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:08,074
My name is Joe...

1676
01:10:08,137 --> 01:10:11,084
and I'm a sex addict.

1677
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:14,610
I just love sex.

1678
01:10:14,677 --> 01:10:18,921
I love it more than food,
money.

1679
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:21,427
If I knew by laying down
with a woman I was going to die,

1680
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:24,396
I'd probably still
have sex.

1681
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:28,457
And when I think about
all the risks I've taken,

1682
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:31,869
I can't believe
I did those things.

1683
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:37,639
I guess my lowest point came

1684
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:42,445
when my 6-year-old son
got on my laptop to play a game

1685
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:44,609
and a porn site
popped up.

1686
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:49,919
He sat there and watched
for over 10 minutes

1687
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:52,926
before I even knew
what was going on.

1688
01:10:52,982 --> 01:10:56,395
I was mortified.

1689
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:02,462
My wife left me.

1690
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:06,136
And my son's probably
scarred for life.

1691
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:11,635
I don't know
if I can change.

1692
01:11:13,969 --> 01:11:16,176
But I'm trying hard
every day.

1693
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:18,377
One day at a time.

1694
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,511
One day at a time.
One day at a time.

1695
01:11:22,811 --> 01:11:24,757
Would anybody else
like to share?

1696
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:33,493
My name is Todd.

1697
01:11:33,555 --> 01:11:38,129
I'm not really sure
how to classify my addiction.

1698
01:11:39,795 --> 01:11:42,071
I guess the best way
to describe it is,

1699
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:45,635
I'm addicted to the chase,

1700
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:48,204
as pertaining to women.

1701
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:51,513
I love getting a woman
so twisted, so into me,

1702
01:11:51,573 --> 01:11:53,416
that she'd do anything.

1703
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:56,183
And once I got her,
I don't know.

1704
01:11:56,245 --> 01:11:59,249
I just don't want her
anymore.

1705
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,056
I used to always
tell myself

1706
01:12:01,116 --> 01:12:02,493
that once I found
the right woman,

1707
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:04,360
you know,
it would be different.

1708
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:08,058
But when I got her,

1709
01:12:08,123 --> 01:12:10,797
I just focused on
the parts of her life

1710
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:12,600
that I couldn't control.

1711
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:15,508
My mom died when I was
in high school.

1712
01:12:15,564 --> 01:12:17,669
I never really understood
why that happened to me.

1713
01:12:17,733 --> 01:12:20,236
Well, the sicker she got
the tighter I held onto her.

1714
01:12:20,302 --> 01:12:21,940
And when she died,

1715
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:24,951
I guess I never
really found my way.

1716
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:29,286
So I'm lost.

1717
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:32,155
I've ruined
my relationships.

1718
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:36,155
My business.

1719
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:38,923
I don't know.
I just...

1720
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:46,071
I just want to be
who I'm supposed to be.

1721
01:12:46,128 --> 01:12:47,801
And you will.

1722
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:50,400
You'll find your way.

1723
01:12:52,134 --> 01:12:53,579
One day at a time.

1724
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:55,376
One day at a time.
One day at a time.

1725
01:12:55,437 --> 01:12:57,576
One day at a time.

1726
01:12:57,639 --> 01:13:00,711
Anyone else
want to share?

1727
01:13:04,146 --> 01:13:06,353
Hi. I'm Nicole.

1728
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:10,891
And I'm a raging
sex addict.

1729
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:13,666
Hello, Nicole.

1730
01:13:19,695 --> 01:13:21,732
Hey. Thanks for coming by.

1731
01:13:21,797 --> 01:13:23,572
You're welcome.

1732
01:13:23,632 --> 01:13:25,077
What do you want
to talk about?

1733
01:13:26,135 --> 01:13:29,514
First, I want to apologize.

1734
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:31,482
For what?

1735
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:33,213
For what happened.

1736
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:36,214
Since we've been apart...

1737
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:40,887
I've been seeing
two other women.

1738
01:13:40,949 --> 01:13:42,860
Look, I know you're upset,
but I need you to listen to me.

1739
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:45,694
I don't want
to listen to you.

1740
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:48,598
I left a good,
decent man

1741
01:13:48,657 --> 01:13:50,898
because you told me
things would be different.

1742
01:13:50,959 --> 01:13:52,370
That you loved me.

1743
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:55,272
That you wanted to support
my dreams.

1744
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:57,776
You left me.
I was devastated.

1745
01:13:59,468 --> 01:14:01,641
Okay? But for all
the wrong reasons.

1746
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:04,741
So I had to do some work
OI'! me.

1747
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:07,644
You wasted my time.

1748
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:11,282
And you played
with my heart.

1749
01:14:11,346 --> 01:14:12,620
You're right. I did.

1750
01:14:12,681 --> 01:14:14,854
But I'm finally
on the right track.

1751
01:14:14,917 --> 01:14:17,864
I don't know if it was
the alone time, the prayer,

1752
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,263
hitting rock bottom.

1753
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:24,662
But I'm different now.
I am. I'm different now.

1754
01:14:24,726 --> 01:14:25,898
And I want you
in my life.

1755
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:28,305
That's not different.

1756
01:14:28,363 --> 01:14:29,740
That's always been
the problem.

1757
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:32,301
You want. You, you, you.

1758
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:36,307
What about me?
What about what I want?

1759
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:37,850
Whatever it is.

1760
01:14:37,906 --> 01:14:40,819
Whatever it is, you got it.

1761
01:14:40,876 --> 01:14:43,686
To move the unmovable.
To support your dreams.

1762
01:14:43,745 --> 01:14:45,349
You got it.

1763
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:47,018
Yeah.

1764
01:14:47,082 --> 01:14:50,996
I want the last six months
of my life back.

1765
01:14:53,288 --> 01:14:54,995
Oh, Shanice.

1766
01:14:55,057 --> 01:14:58,527
I'm happy you're changing.

1767
01:15:00,462 --> 01:15:02,032
Hopefully you'll be
a better man...

1768
01:15:02,097 --> 01:15:04,043
for someone else.

1769
01:15:04,099 --> 01:15:06,579
Goodbye, Todd,

1770
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:17,591
Oh, man, you ever
accidentally fart, anybody?

1771
01:15:17,646 --> 01:15:19,057
Oh, don't act like it,

1772
01:15:19,114 --> 01:15:20,923
because the reason I'm asking
is because I smell it.

1773
01:15:20,983 --> 01:15:23,122
Somebody in here
done accidentally farted.

1774
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:25,165
Y'all need to quit
with all that.

1775
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:27,632
Silence is deadly, okay?

1776
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:30,670
So if you think it's gonna
slip out, get out.

1777
01:15:30,726 --> 01:15:32,399
How about that?
Oh, I can't take it.

1778
01:15:32,461 --> 01:15:33,769
You guys are killing me.

1779
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:36,537
And don't poo-poo
over other people house. Hello?

1780
01:15:36,598 --> 01:15:38,635
That's something you need to do
at your own house.

1781
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:39,872
When people come
over my house,

1782
01:15:39,935 --> 01:15:41,539
they want to know
can they use the bathroom?

1783
01:15:41,603 --> 01:15:43,480
I need to know for what:
number one or number two?

1784
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:45,485
Because you can't
number two here.

1785
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,043
Especially old people,

1786
01:15:47,109 --> 01:15:48,486
because they got all them
medicines and stuff

1787
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:49,682
in their poo-poo.

1788
01:15:49,745 --> 01:15:51,588
Oh, try to kill me.
I don't think so.

1789
01:15:51,647 --> 01:15:54,093
So go home, get out,
and I'm out.

1790
01:15:54,149 --> 01:15:56,060
I'm Melanie Comacho.
You guys have been great.

1791
01:15:56,118 --> 01:15:57,495
Thank you.

1792
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:59,123
No more farting.

1793
01:15:59,187 --> 01:16:02,134
Oh, man. J, I really appreciate
you helping me out, man.

1794
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:03,601
I needed someone
I could trust.

1795
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:05,104
Oh, thanks, man.
I needed the gig.

1796
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:09,404
Place is packed.

1797
01:16:09,464 --> 01:16:10,670
That's always a good thing.

1798
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:11,938
How'd you do it?

1799
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,604
Wasn't me.

1800
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:20,250
I want to thank you all
for coming out tonight.

1801
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:22,721
This is our grand reopening,

1802
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:25,657
and tonight I am especially
proud to present

1803
01:16:25,714 --> 01:16:29,787
a world famous comedian:
my father, Nate Ryder.

1804
01:16:32,688 --> 01:16:34,133
No, no, no, no, no.

1805
01:16:34,189 --> 01:16:36,601
But thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

1806
01:16:36,658 --> 01:16:39,195
Ooh, look at all the comics
out in the house.

1807
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:42,504
My goodness, look like old hag's
convention down in Vegas.

1808
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,076
Well, seriously, though, I would
like to thank all my friends

1809
01:16:47,135 --> 01:16:50,378
both, you know, new and old
for coming on out tonight.

1810
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:52,817
Want y'all to know something.
My act is a little different.

1811
01:16:52,874 --> 01:16:55,650
See, I'm a Christian now.
Yeah, praise the Lord.

1812
01:16:55,711 --> 01:16:58,692
So, you know, things I used
to do I don't do no more.

1813
01:16:58,747 --> 01:17:01,921
Yeah. I don't drink no more,
I don't smoke no more.

1814
01:17:01,984 --> 01:17:05,329
There's some things
I do miss.

1815
01:17:05,387 --> 01:17:06,593
Not what you think about.

1816
01:17:06,655 --> 01:17:07,963
You're nasty,
that's your problem.

1817
01:17:08,023 --> 01:17:09,798
You need Jesus.
I'm talking about cussing.

1818
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:11,701
I don't cuss no more!

1819
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,900
Cussing, it's just cussing.
I miss cussing.

1820
01:17:14,963 --> 01:17:17,671
Some of y'all
know who I am, you know?

1821
01:17:17,733 --> 01:17:20,612
Y'all still yell "dang,"
slipping the "damn."

1822
01:17:22,871 --> 01:17:25,010
Excuse me, Lord.
I'm sorry.

1823
01:17:25,073 --> 01:17:29,044
Yeah, I just don't get cussing
Christians.

1824
01:17:29,111 --> 01:17:30,522
Cussing saints.

1825
01:17:30,579 --> 01:17:32,217
How you gonna go
from "hallelujah"

1826
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:35,557
to "I wish a so and so would go
back to hallelujah" again?

1827
01:17:35,617 --> 01:17:37,790
I don't get that transition,
you know what I mean?

1828
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:41,532
Hi.
Hi.

1829
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:44,130
I thought...

1830
01:17:45,627 --> 01:17:47,368
I'm just here
to support you.

1831
01:17:47,429 --> 01:17:49,875
You know, I figured if I showed
you what it looked like,

1832
01:17:49,931 --> 01:17:52,343
you'll know how to do it
when it's time to support me.

1833
01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:00,014
I got you.

1834
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:04,022
Hostess with the mostest.

1835
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:09,390
There is one thing
that I do miss.

1836
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:11,294
I guess I ain't the only
nasty one in the room.

1837
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:15,096
Amen. Glory to God.
Hey, sister freak over there.

1838
01:18:15,157 --> 01:18:16,500
Fornication!

1839
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:20,763
I miss fornication!

1840
01:18:20,829 --> 01:18:22,467
Oh, I'm sorry.

1841
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:24,374
I miss fornication!

1842
01:18:24,433 --> 01:18:27,903
Turn to high-five three Negros
that say I miss fornication.

1843
01:18:27,969 --> 01:18:30,882
I miss fornication!
I miss fornication!

1844
01:18:32,774 --> 01:18:35,220
Thank you, Jesus.

1845
01:18:35,277 --> 01:18:36,779
Yeah. How could--

1846
01:18:36,845 --> 01:18:39,485
I never understood how could
something so good

1847
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:41,550
be so bad?

1848
01:18:41,616 --> 01:18:43,425
Amen.

1849
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:45,396
So bad.

1850
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:47,957
I guess, like,
finally I appreciate

1851
01:18:48,023 --> 01:18:50,128
how fat folks suffer
with ice cream.

1852
01:18:50,192 --> 01:18:52,069
Tastes so good.

1853
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:54,733
But, Lord, it's bad.

1854
01:18:54,796 --> 01:18:57,106
That look like a cone
right there.

1855
01:18:57,165 --> 01:18:58,610
Freaky lady,
you want a bite?

1856
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:00,578
You go ahead, go ahead.
You can have some ice cream.

1857
01:19:00,635 --> 01:19:01,978
You know you...

1858
01:19:04,773 --> 01:19:07,083
Give me a round of applause.
I'm funny.
