1
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,969
That's last year's Battle of the Year.

2
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,771
It's an international b-boy competition
held in France,

3
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,042
which for the last 15 years

4
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,170
the United States has lost.

5
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,764
I went to a concert this past weekend,

6
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,370
and I overheard some high school kids
saying that b-boying was no longer cool

7
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,011
and it was something their parents did.

8
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,760
That scared me.

9
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,364
It scared me because this company,
everything I've built,

10
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,006
started off with b-boying.

11
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,602
It's obviously still cool over in France.

12
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,048
The government subsidizes
Battle of the Year.

13
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,010
The government is keeping hip-hop alive.

14
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,805
Still cool in Russia,

15
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,325
Germany,

16
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,370
Korea.

17
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,201
But it's not cool here where it was founded.

18
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,449
Which would explain why, domestically,
our sales are down.

19
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,042
Merchandising, record sales,
ticket sales, apparel.

20
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,248
But for the first time
in this company's history,

21
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,370
<i>international sales are exceeding domestic.</i>

22
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,805
<i>We are in trouble.</i>

23
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,204
<i>Think about it, if b-boying ain't cool,
how long before hip-hop isn't cool?</i>

24
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,250
<i>And what will that mean
to our business, our company?</i>

25
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,125
Hey, yo!

26
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,129
- Wake up!
- Hold on!

27
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,526
Get your ass up.

28
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,082
Come on, man.
You can sleep when you're dead.

29
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,531
Coming.

30
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,206
Dante?

31
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,248
See your maid
doesn't do windows, does she?

32
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,691
What the hell are you doing here, man?

33
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,250
I've been calling, you ain't been answering.

34
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,881
I've been busy lately.

35
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,930
All right, well, bring your busy ass over
and open up this door.

36
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,201
This ain't no prison visit.

37
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,807
You look like shit.

38
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,048
Look, if you came here to sweat me, D...

39
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,610
Came here to make you a proposition.

40
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,325
You gonna let me in or what?

41
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,290
Okay.

42
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,130
This... This old thing work?

43
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,008
All right. Here we go.

44
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,610
Check this out.

45
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,124
That's Japan versus Korea,
world champions.

46
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,810
I mean, b-boying ain't the same

47
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,570
from back in the days
when we were dancing, man.

48
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,244
I mean, what's the farthest
we ever had to go to battle,

49
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,367
the Bronx?

50
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,246
Now these kids are battling
in Japan, Germany, France.

51
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,883
So, the Battle of the Year
is coming up, right?

52
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,689
And I'm sponsoring the US crew.

53
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,931
So my crew is called LA's Finest.
Now, these kids are good.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,651
Acrobatic, they got skills,
but they're not great.

55
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,886
Yet.

56
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,121
Only missing one thing.

57
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,681
You.

58
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,651
I want you to coach the crew.

59
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,966
Coach?

60
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,327
Now, I know you need money, so...

61
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,965
Here you go, check that out,

62
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,361
let me know if that meets your approval.

63
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,130
But the freestyle sessions are next month,

64
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,645
and I need you to prepare my crew for battle.

65
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,643
- I was a basketball coach.
-It doesn't matter.

66
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,405
A coach is a coach,
and you were the best I've ever seen, man.

67
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,602
- It's in your heart.
- I ain't that guy anymore.

68
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,921
Just come with me,
let's go check out the boys,

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,924
and if you think they suck, you walk away.

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,480
No pressure. So what are you waiting on?

71
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,085
- You don't want me, D.
- I mean, seriously,

72
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,565
how many opportunities do you have

73
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,603
come knocking at your window
every day, WB?

74
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,126
- Can't even keep my own shit straight.
- Look, I'm not gonna stand here

75
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,690
and pretend like
I know what you're going through,

76
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,086
'cause I don't.

77
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,601
But, come on, man, that fire in your heart,

78
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,523
that need to win and the ability

79
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,325
to infect those around you
and get them to believe the same thing?

80
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,051
Man, you still got that shit.
Guys like you don't lose it.

81
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,050
Look, man, this right here, this ain't you.

82
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,006
You had trajectory.

83
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,691
And I'll be frank with you, man,

84
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,603
you and I both know
she's never coming back.

85
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,563
You know what, man?

86
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,086
- We're done here.
- I was wrong.

87
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,929
This was a prison visit.

88
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,762
And this is your cell, man.

89
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,123
The only difference
has been between my life and yours,

90
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,764
is that I made a life out of opening doors

91
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,245
and you made one out of closing them.

92
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,929
Dig One Entertainment. Please hold.

93
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,170
Dig One Entertainment. How may I help you?

94
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,046
WB!

95
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,571
Welcome to Dig One, baby.

96
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,290
What's up, D?

97
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,122
- It's impressive.
- So talk to me.

98
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,168
Tell me something good, man. You in?

99
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,725
Not yet.

100
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,489
I need to do some homework,
see if I can even pull this off, all right?

101
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,846
Follow me.

102
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,926
<i>That's it.</i>

103
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,571
About 100 hours of footage,
goes back four or five years.

104
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,684
- Need anything else?
- A hundred hours, huh?

105
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,685
Maybe a pot of coffee, couple sandwiches.

106
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,368
So that is just coffee in there, right?

107
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,403
Yeah. Just coffee.

108
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,841
- Good.
- Keep the good shit right here.

109
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,371
Come on, D.

110
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,369
Can't plug the cork overnight.

111
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,603
- Doesn't work that way.
<i>- I'll</i> be in my office.

112
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,441
Okay, got you a fresh pot.

113
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,883
Did you want me to order you
any dinner before I punch out?

114
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,570
- No, I'm all good, thank you.
- Yeah.

115
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,890
Yo, look at those elbow spins.

116
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,365
That shit is nasty.

117
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,646
Koreans came strong that year.

118
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,881
Those K-boys are like superheroes.

119
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,168
- You b-boy?
- Nah, I wish.

120
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,926
My people are not exactly
chosen when it comes to breaking.

121
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,168
- What do you mean, your people?
- Jews.

122
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,844
We're rhythmically challenged.

123
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,400
We're stripped of our swag
at the circumcision.

124
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,966
I've made my peace with it. Anyway, I'm a fan.

125
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,445
Be dope to see the US crew take the BOTYs.

126
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,364
- What the hell is a BOTY?
- Seriously?

127
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,442
Have a seat. What's your name?

128
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,001
Franklyn, with a

129
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,605
Blake.

130
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,084
So, Franklyn with a fill me in.

131
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,010
The BOTYs stands for Battle of the Year.

132
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,923
It's the world cup of b-boying.

133
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,486
It's the premier event,
the big daddy of them all.

134
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,206
It started in Germany in the '90s,
but now it takes place in France.

135
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,327
Why France?

136
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,410
'Cause the only thing the French
revere more than carbs is dance.

137
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,690
Anyway, 20 countries bring their top crew
to battle for the world championship.

138
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,969
And a nice Jewish kid like you
knows all this because?

139
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,481
They don't teach you how to
pick up chicks at Hebrew school,

140
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,284
and breaking made me cool.

141
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,688
I mean, I might be Jewish,
but my religion is hip-hop.

142
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,040
<i>You've</i> seen <i>Planet B-Boy,</i> yeah?

143
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,406
Afraid not.

144
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,721
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

145
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,928
Why is Dante having you coach his crew?

146
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,165
That's a good question.

147
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,806
<i>Planet B-Boy, it's</i> like <i>our bible.</i>

148
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,209
It's this dope documentary
about what b-boying is now.

149
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,166
Can I see that?

150
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,770
- What, this?
- Yeah.

151
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,365
What is this thing?

152
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,608
It's the new Sony tablet.

153
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,364
It's the future.

154
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,881
<i>Planet B-Boy,</i>
it's got a billion rentals on Netflix.

155
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,001
Hold on.

156
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,527
Check it out.

157
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,209
Come on, wake up! Wake up!

158
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,685
No time to sleep! Work to do!

159
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,890
- What time is it?
-9:00.

160
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,445
You been holed up in here all night?

161
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,726
Hundred hours of footage, right?

162
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,490
Guess you did your homework, huh?

163
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,483
Enough, anyway-

164
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,370
When did all this shit happen?

165
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,131
- Feeling old yet?
- Little bit.

166
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,929
The moves these guys
are pulling off are phenomenal.

167
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,565
The Koreans are on fire.

168
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,404
And we need some of that fire for our crew.

169
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,522
So what's up, man? We got a deal or what?

170
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,409
- Two conditions.
- Name them.

171
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,369
First, I want Franklyn here
as my assistant coach.

172
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,443
- For real?
- This guy?

173
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,561
Yeah.

174
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,162
All right, done. Second one?

175
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,730
This right here.

176
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,649
Made a little addendum to your contract.

177
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,210
If this is about money, I'll take care of it.

178
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,442
It's just one line, D. Just read it.

179
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,041
"If I do this..."

180
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,804
I can't make this out, man.
It's chicken scratch.

181
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,564
- What does that say?
-"If I do this,

182
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,523
"I got to do it on my own terms."

183
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,050
Little place for your initials right there.

184
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,610
Okay.

185
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,123
You are a tough negotiator, my man.

186
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,801
All right, let's go see
the crew in about an hour.

187
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,006
Hey, Jan, how you doing?

188
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,127
I'm doing busy.

189
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,720
Can I see D? It won't even take a minute.

190
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,724
And I would do that for you because?

191
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,486
'Cause we're co-workers
and I'd really appreciate it.

192
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,965
Try again.

193
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,801
'Cause I'm just a boy
standing in front of a girl

194
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,446
asking her to further his career.

195
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,886
I love that movie.

196
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,364
- What's your name again?
- Seriously?

197
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,289
Franklyn. With a

198
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,408
Franklyn with a "Y" is here to see you.

199
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,371
Go back to the first one.

200
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,361
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bother you.

201
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,646
No bother. Have a seat.

202
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,206
Okay, let's go with that one,
but kill the roses.

203
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,044
The band's manager really wanted the roses.

204
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,130
Right, killing the roses.

205
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,290
What's up?

206
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,971
I just wanted to tell you

207
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,129
I didn't know anything about him asking me
to take the coaching job.

208
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,566
You saying you don't want to do this now?

209
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,642
No, I want to do it,

210
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,731
but I didn't want you to think
that I put WB up to it or something.

211
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,326
Listen, nobody puts WB
up to anything, not even me.

212
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,647
Yeah, I just wanted to make sure
you and I were cool.

213
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,484
- Cool?
- I mean, you hooked me up with this job, D,

214
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,409
and I don't want to seem ungrateful.

215
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,847
Look here, man, let me level with you.

216
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,410
I don't even know who you are.

217
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,766
What's your name?

218
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,080
Seriously?

219
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,010
I'm Franklyn with a

220
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,168
- How old are you?
- I'll be 23 in December.

221
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,810
Franklyn with a
do you know who these two guys are?

222
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,446
Yeah.

223
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,522
Yeah, y'all were ground-breakers
back in the day.

224
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,531
When I started off with the crew,
we were called the Battle Troop Crew.

225
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,762
We battled each other
more than we battled other crews.

226
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,160
Until WB showed up.

227
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,843
<i>Comes up as a foster kid from Georgia</i>

228
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,129
<i>with this country, hillbilly-type swag,</i>

229
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,602
but it was something about him, man,
that he just unified the crew.

230
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,364
<i>He just knows how to bring people together.</i>

231
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,885
And this is in the early days of hip-hop,

232
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,203
back before white boys
were rapping and b-boying.

233
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,442
<i>That wasn't around back then.
It was just black and Latino.</i>

234
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,646
That's all we had.

235
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,451
So when we would show up to a battle, man.

236
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,641
<i>But you know what?</i>

237
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,370
<i>When he'd leave that cipher,</i>

238
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,289
<i>he went from white bread to Wonder Bread.</i>

239
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,640
<i>That's how good he was.</i>

240
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,484
Guess I know why you call him WB.

241
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,641
Oh, yeah.

242
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,566
But if he was so dope,
then why did he stop breaking?

243
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,409
<i>He wanted to do the right thing.</i>

244
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,801
<i>See, back in those days, man,
we were all broke.</i>

245
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,645
- There was no money in b-boying.
- Sure.

246
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,563
So, when he got his girlfriend pregnant,

247
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,723
her uncle offered him an assistant basketball
coaching job at St. Mark's,

248
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,167
-and he took it.
- Wait, not St. Mark's that, that racked up

249
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,322
-all those state championships?
- Yeah.

250
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,482
<i>And he was the head coach
at the time that they did it.</i>

251
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,164
<i>Then what is he doing back here?</i>

252
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,481
- Starting over.
- I don't follow.

253
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,244
Couple years ago,

254
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,325
<i>WB lost his wife and son
in a horrible car accident.</i>

255
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,526
<i>Completely tore his world apart, man.</i>

256
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,681
<i>I mean, he just...</i>

257
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,762
He checked out.

258
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,765
<i>And I'm hoping that he's ready
to check back in.</i>

259
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,370
<i>And if I'm right,</i>

260
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,841
<i>you're gonna learn more
in five weeks from that man</i>

261
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,922
<i>than you ever would
in five years in this place.</i>

262
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,286
<i>That I promise.</i>

263
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,200
If it doesn't work out, well,
we tried, right, Franklyn

264
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,203
with a "Y"?

265
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,971
Change how you think, change your life.

266
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,125
There it is. There it is!

267
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,411
See?

268
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,886
D, didn't I tell you? Bring on the French.

269
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,008
Bring on the punk-ass Koreans.

270
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,003
I like that. Looking good.

271
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,566
I like what I see. Good job.

272
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,165
Coach, what do you think?

273
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,169
You saw me clapping.

274
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,645
You guys are good.

275
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,165
No disrespect, but aren't those

276
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,487
the same moves you guys
brought to France?

277
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,011
That wasn't anything like France.

278
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,320
I've been watching your tapes.

279
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,930
European tours, regionals.

280
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,525
You've changed the sequencing, yes,

281
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,688
but it's basically the same
routine as four years ago.

282
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,326
D, didn't I tell you this
coaching thing wasn't gonna fly?

283
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,083
You don't tell me shit. You understand?

284
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,685
I'm not trying to play the hard case with you,

285
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,529
but I just want you to know
we do have other options.

286
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,841
Are they threatening me?
Sounds like a threat, right?

287
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,849
- Are you threatening me?
- Come on, man.

288
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,970
This is your coach. What Coach says, you do.
End of story.

289
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,206
Coach?

290
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,691
All right, everybody line up right here.

291
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,450
Come on, fellas.

292
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,682
All right, everybody turn to the right.

293
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,724
Chins up, start walking.

294
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,887
Let's take this outside.

295
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,041
- What the hell are you doing?
- Think they got options, right?

296
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,646
I brought you here to make 'em better,
not kick 'em out into the street.

297
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,484
They may have a little bit of attitude...

298
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,005
I don't care about attitude. Bring it.

299
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,247
These guys are stuck, D.
They ain't getting any better.

300
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,810
How long they been a crew, five years?

301
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,360
- Six years.
- Even worse.

302
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,725
They've hit the tipping point.

303
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,168
They've stopped putting all their blood,
sweat and tears into winning a battle

304
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,811
and started putting it into just not losing.

305
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,331
Trust me, man, I got a plan.

306
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,641
What you have is an empty room.

307
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,848
That's what you got.

308
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,242
All right, what's your plan? Make it good.

309
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,403
Insanity is doing
the same damn thing over and over

310
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,607
and expecting a different result.

311
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,404
That's what we've been doing.

312
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,766
It's why we can't compete, D.

313
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,923
All of our competitors are gonna bring
their best dancers,

314
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,523
but the US, we send one crew from one city
with maybe two or three top-tier b-boys on it.

315
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,604
What we should be doing
is cherry-picking the top b-boys

316
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,564
from every crew in every city across America.

317
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,760
Okay, let me get this straight.

318
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,845
So you're saying put together some kind of
b-boy all-star team?

319
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,291
A b-boy dream team.

320
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,964
We did the same thing in basketball,
and we started that sport, too.

321
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,448
We were getting schooled in the Olympics
till we put Jordan, Magic, Bird,

322
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,050
Barkley, Ewing on the court,

323
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,360
our dream team.

324
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,283
That dream team had time to prepare.

325
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,283
You do realize you're trying to put together

326
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,646
a whole new crew in what?

327
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,125
Battle of the Year is in three months?

328
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,971
Here's the beauty of it.
Freestyle sessions are next week.

329
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,644
All the top crews are gonna be in town.

330
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,047
Instead of a tune-up for LA's Finest,

331
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,122
why not turn it into
a try-out for a national team?

332
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,131
When you put the word out
you're sponsoring a dream team,

333
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,566
they'll come in droves.

334
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,802
It's an opportunity of a lifetime.

335
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,120
So that's your plan?

336
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,406
That's my plan.

337
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,563
It better work.

338
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,924
<i>All right, so listen up.</i>

339
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,402
<i>Dante, the once legendary b-boy,
now hip-hop mogul,</i>

340
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,881
<i>is putting out a nationwide shout.</i>

341
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,606
<i>Yo, this is it. Pay close attention.</i>

342
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,603
<i>Crews from sea to shining sea,</i>

343
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,762
<i>north, south, east and west, this is for you.</i>

344
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,606
<i>My man Dante is on the hunt
for America's best b-boys</i>

345
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,082
<i>to represent the US
in the world championship.</i>

346
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,084
<i>That's right, he's gonna
handpick a dream team.</i>

347
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,611
<i>You want to be a part of it,</i>

348
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,126
<i>get down to that freestyle competition
with Cross One,</i>

349
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,851
<i>and if you think you got
what it takes to represent</i>

350
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,685
<i>the red, the white, the blue,
you'd better bring it.</i>

351
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,125
<i>- Okay, Terrence.
-Check, check, check.</i>

352
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,601
<i>My man D is prowling for b-boy gold.</i>

353
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,524
<i>If your crew has what it takes,
you need to come on down here.</i>

354
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,604
<i>We are looking for the best of the best.</i>

355
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,722
<i>I don't care how you get down here.</i>

356
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,365
<i>Just bring your ass on down.</i>

357
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,966
Here's our first 32.

358
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,121
So what now?

359
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,565
Now we see what they're made of.

360
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,045
Tell me your name and where you're from.

361
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,491
Name's Sight, representing Desert Rock.

362
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,722
This is Kilowatt, Cincinnati Street Kings.

363
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,046
Grifter, Miami Viper Crew.

364
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,049
Bambino from the Rip Rock Crew, Baltimore.

365
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,491
Mayhem, Orlando, Florida.

366
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,891
Lil Adonis from Chicago.

367
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,240
Flipz, Bronx Rockers.

368
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,407
- I go by Kid.
- Rebel.

369
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,567
And we're representing Philadelphia.

370
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,251
Anis, Hollywood Jet Funk, via France.

371
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,169
Do Knock, LA Strangler Crew.

372
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,401
The name's Rooster.

373
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,084
I got the five elements of death,

374
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,324
footwork, style, power, originality and soul.

375
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,721
If you ain't got that,
don't even get in the ring.

376
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,928
- So why do you break?
- Breaking is my everything.

377
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,326
This means everything in the world to me.

378
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,561
It's the most important thing in my life.

379
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,484
- It's self-expression.
- I live it, I breathe it.

380
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,085
I didn't really have much,
and then I found breaking.

381
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,770
After Afghanistan, I needed b-boying.

382
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,841
- Breaking saved my...
- Life.

383
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,400
-It's the only thing I got.
- I'm a b-boy, and I'm gay,

384
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,841
and a lot of people have issue with that.

385
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,605
Imagine you're the son of a rabbi
and you're trying to be cool and break.

386
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,404
You're Jewish and a b-boy.

387
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,929
He's probably adopted.

388
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,765
A main goal that I think every b-boy has
is Battle of the Year.

389
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,524
Battle of the Year
is like the Mecca of b-boying.

390
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,284
It's like Eli Manning winning the Super Bowl.

391
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,686
It's like the Olympics to breaking.

392
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,205
- Battle of the Year means...
- Everything to a b-boy.

393
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,441
It's the only thing there is.

394
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,124
Why do you deserve to be on this crew?

395
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,766
- There is no dream team without Grifter.
-'Cause I'm damn good.

396
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,888
I have what it takes to be one of the...

397
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,883
- Best ever.
- Ever?

398
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,610
I want to be on that team that brings it home.

399
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,886
What do you think about when you battle?

400
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,530
My main focus is, if I don't win,

401
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,045
I got to go back to my old life.

402
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,122
- My mother.
- B-girls.

403
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,884
- Being so damn good.
- Kicking ass.

404
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,564
I think about how much I love b-boying.

405
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,246
Yeah, b-girls.

406
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,963
First of all, I want
to thank you all for coming.

407
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,122
We appreciate your efforts.
You did a great job.

408
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,248
But we only have 22 spots to fill,

409
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,402
so please stand up when I call your name.

410
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,164
- First up is Do Knock.
- Yes!

411
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,724
- Anis.
- Yes.

412
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,007
Hey, let me hear my name.

413
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,721
Sniper.

414
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,003
- Flipz.
- Yes.

415
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,411
Grifter.

416
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,408
- Did you hear your name?
- Man, we good.

417
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,641
Lil Adonis.

418
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,165
- Kilowatt.
- Yes.

419
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,328
- Bambino.
- Yeah.

420
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,084
- Aces.
- Yeah.

421
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,844
Mayhem.

422
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,763
- Gillatine.
- I knew it!

423
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,251
- Kid and Rebel.
- Yo.

424
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,448
- That's what's up.
- Both of us, man, both of us.

425
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,363
- Swat.
-A'ig ht.

426
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,687
- Abbstarr. Flair.
- Yeah!

427
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,006
Baby, yes!

428
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,610
- Dani.
- Amen.

429
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,284
-Intricate.
- I made it.

430
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,441
And finally...

431
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,441
Rooster.

432
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,363
Yes!

433
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,051
If I did not call your name,
thank you for coming.

434
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,202
If I did, see Franklyn here.

435
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,290
And, gentlemen,

436
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,966
be prepared to train harder, faster and longer

437
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,805
than humanly possible,
'cause over the next nine weeks,

438
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,121
only 13 of you
will make the final dream team.

439
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,361
That's it.

440
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,881
Damn.

441
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,491
What's up with the barbed wire?

442
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,005
What the hell is this place?

443
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,923
It's an old abandoned
juvenile detention center.

444
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,724
- Shit, my mom was right.
- What?

445
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,644
She always said I'd end up
in a place like this.

446
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,563
Dante makes mad money.
What are we doing here?

447
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,011
Coach picked it.

448
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,924
He used to teach summer basketball camp
here after it closed.

449
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,520
Not exactly B'nai B'rith, right?

450
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,402
Listen, man, just 'cause we're both Jewish
doesn't mean we're best friends.

451
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,681
Good stuff.

452
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,683
- This place is nasty.
- Looks good to me.

453
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,240
Compared to where I'm from,
this joint's the goddamn Hilton.

454
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,686
Welcome, gentlemen.

455
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,000
This beautiful park-like setting

456
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,969
is gonna be your new home
for the next few months.

457
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,565
Dorms are right through here.

458
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,165
Go ahead and drop your stuff
and get settled in.

459
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,730
- Nah, man.
- Are you serious?

460
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,007
- This is ridiculous.
- Crazy.

461
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,008
Yo, what is this place?

462
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,044
Listen, Coach, I was thinking on some ideas

463
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,487
ever since you made me your assistant.
Well, I want to earn my keep.

464
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,006
Anyway, I think we should get
a choreographer if you're really serious

465
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,162
about making a splash
at the Battle of the Year.

466
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,801
Someone who's done world tours
and worked with major artists.

467
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,040
What's that around your neck, Franklyn?

468
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,490
It's my coaching whistle.

469
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,846
Let me have it.

470
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,729
- Why?
- Give it up.

471
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,690
It's more of a support whistle for your

472
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,728
-head-coach whistle, so...
- Franklyn.

473
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,290
It just separates me from the b-boys.

474
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,328
- Let's have it.
- Can I say no?

475
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,164
- I really want to say no.
- Give me the damn whistle.

476
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,287
No.

477
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,244
Anything else?

478
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,924
Where's the coaches' quarters?

479
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,571
Over there, but you'll be staying with them.

480
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,130
Seriously?

481
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,326
Listen up!

482
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,168
Battle of the Year is three months away.

483
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,844
Take a moment, think about that.

484
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,051
In three months,

485
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,008
nine of you will be sitting
back on your couches

486
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,971
while the other 13 are in France,
representing America.

487
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,570
Center stage in a global arena.

488
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,801
Choice is yours.

489
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,085
You do this right,

490
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,242
nothing in your life will ever be the same.

491
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,285
Don't make the mistake
of thinking I'm your friend.

492
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,850
I'm not.

493
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,810
I'm here for one purpose.

494
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,085
Turn you into a team by whatever
means I deem necessary, period.

495
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,083
'Cause right now, in Korea, Japan,

496
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,288
France, Russia, all over the world,

497
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,089
guys are training 24/7

498
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,288
'cause they want to win
the Battle of the Year.

499
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,931
The question is, do you?

500
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,925
Our rules are simple.
Practice starts at 6:00 a.m.

501
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,923
-6:00 a.m.?
-6:00 a.m.?

502
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,843
You come at 6:01...

503
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,211
...you will be gone!

504
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,808
We train 12 hours a day, every day.

505
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,405
God takes Sundays off, we don't.

506
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,606
We ain't got time.

507
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,490
This facility will become your world.

508
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,451
Step outside that world, you will be gone.

509
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,091
Bitch about my simple rules,
you will be gone.

510
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,844
Hey, Coach.

511
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,002
Ask me some wise-ass question

512
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,766
about "you will be gone,"
and you will be gone.

513
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,571
Over each of the next nine Fridays,

514
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,644
I'll be handing one of you one of these.

515
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,766
Bus pass.

516
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,604
Take you back to wherever
it is you came from.

517
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,331
And you will be gone.

518
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,925
- Coach.
- Yeah.

519
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,286
- Tomorrow's Friday.
- That's correct.

520
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,011
And tomorrow, one of you will be gone.

521
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,128
You will be gone.

522
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,321
- Yo, check that out, son.
- What?

523
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,721
- This is what everybody's battling for.
- Pie?

524
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,046
Yeah, pie.

525
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,248
Twenty-two starving dogs
and not enough to go around.

526
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,481
I got mine.

527
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,202
- I know, I know, I got it.
- No, I'm serious. Focus.

528
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,884
Don't talk to anybody, don't look at nobody.

529
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,883
- Just us, double trouble.
- Right, double trouble.

530
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,122
- What's up, Kid?
- What's up, Do Knock?

531
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,850
Yo, what did I just say, man?
Are you serious?

532
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,126
Come on, man, he's cool.

533
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,561
Yay, herb-crusted shank steak
in a white wine reduction sauce.

534
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,483
Bon appétit, guys.

535
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,091
- We got a problem?
- I don't have a problem.

536
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,208
Why'd you get up when I sat down?

537
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,171
Listen, man, where I'm from,
we don't ask and you don't tell.

538
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,401
You should try it.

539
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,045
Are we good?

540
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,241
This is like Fame, but with Bloods and Crips.

541
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,971
Put 22 lions in a cage,
someone's bound to get bit.

542
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,203
I'm gonna have a drink. Take over.

543
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,489
Have 'em in their rooms by 11:00
and make sure they clean up their trays.

544
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,130
Me alone?

545
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,360
But I haven't even
established dominance yet.

546
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,450
What if they start throwing punches?

547
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,931
Try not to get hit.

548
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,130
Cool.

549
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,605
I'll just be here trading
cigarettes for protection.

550
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,127
You're gonna have a drink alone.
That's healthy.

551
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,967
<i>The US b-boys,
they are mostly known for having</i>

552
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,202
<i>a lot of individual skills for battling.</i>

553
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,244
<i>They need to get together
as a crew and also overcome</i>

554
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,322
<i>that ego problem
that most of the b-boys have.</i>

555
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,925
<i>It's disastrous.</i>

556
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,281
Sweet.

557
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,486
Yo.

558
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,448
Trying to be the first one gone?

559
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,720
Sorry.

560
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,926
Flipz.

561
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,930
Grab a pair.

562
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,445
Yo!

563
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,488
Dream Team sweats?

564
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,321
Sick!

565
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,206
Why you late, Flipz?
Yo, nice sweats, but what are these?

566
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,282
Baby Gap? That's cute.
You think you can take that to France?

567
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,600
Man, I just got here.

568
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,091
And you, look at these pockets
on your titties.

569
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,241
That shit ain't gonna get you to France.

570
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,324
You know who's going to France?
I'm going to France.

571
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,961
What you talking about?

572
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,691
All right, everybody line up,
shoulder to shoulder! Move!

573
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,922
I said, move!

574
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,968
What the hell? First day.

575
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,089
So this is how we begin, huh?

576
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,242
At each other's throats.

577
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,567
There's two ways
to have the tallest building in the world.

578
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,769
One, build yourself a giant-ass skyscraper.

579
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,285
Two...

580
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,964
...tear all the other skyscrapers down.

581
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,125
We're here to build.

582
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,089
To build a team.

583
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,083
The quicker you get that through your heads,

584
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,561
the better chance you got
of making that team.

585
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,241
Battle of the Year is your chance
to stand on top of the world.

586
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,243
But not if you keep thinking small.

587
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,722
Not if you're just trying to prove
you're better than the b-boy next to you.

588
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,450
Hey, Coach, I ain't got to prove shit.

589
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,363
I know I'm better than
the b-boy standing next to me.

590
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,363
- Still running that mouth, bro?
- Want to try and shut it?

591
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,566
Hey! Hey!

592
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,722
All right, that's it! That's it!

593
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,928
That's enough! You two got a problem?

594
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,684
- Do Knock's just jealous of Rooster.
-Hey!

595
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,410
I said, shut it!

596
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,845
Get back in line!

597
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,445
Get in line!

598
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,526
So you got to know
which one's the best, huh?

599
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,206
Well, let's clear the decks and find out.

600
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,487
We're splitting into teams.
I need two captains.

601
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,125
Do Knock and Rooster, surprise, surprise.

602
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,211
Pick your teams.

603
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,007
Double Trouble.

604
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,366
Anis, Flipz.

605
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,527
Kilowatt.

606
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,931
<i>Same.</i>

607
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,129
That's it, that's it! Let's go!

608
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,082
I want to see a warm-up.

609
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,286
Get it, little man!

610
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,407
Get him out of there!

611
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,048
- Let's go, baby!
- What you doing, huh?

612
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,167
Work it out, work it out.

613
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,925
Coach, can I ask you a question?

614
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,331
Smoke him, Rooster!

615
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,641
If the idea is making these guys
a team, then...

616
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,921
- Why have them battle?
- Yeah.

617
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,764
Isn't there enough bad blood already?

618
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,008
Just trying to figure out why
we're kicking the hornets' nest.

619
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,923
It's not like these guys
don't feel the pressure.

620
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,091
Wrong kind of pressure.

621
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,487
The right kind will make them a team.

622
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,607
Let's go!

623
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,045
Let's go, baby!

624
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,771
I'm about to show you how it's done.

625
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,207
- Yeah, that's right, boy.
- What?

626
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,567
- Man, you ain't got nothing!
- Yeah, get him!

627
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,529
Yeah, put it to him now.

628
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,608
Yo, Grifter, what are you doing?

629
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,165
Yo, it's not even your turn.

630
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,610
That's so wack.

631
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,403
Back up. I got this.

632
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,081
I got this. I got this.

633
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,003
I just owned you! Oh, yeah!

634
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,411
- Yeah!
- That's all you got, kid?

635
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,324
And especially you, Rooster!
No more questions.

636
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,802
- No more questions.
- This is a joke, right?

637
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,370
I look like I'm joking?

638
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,010
Today's Friday, Grifter,
somebody's got to go.

639
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,168
Not me. Hell, no, not me, Coach.
Any one of them, yo.

640
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,083
- Take your damn pick.
- You are my pick.

641
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,730
I said we're breaking into teams.

642
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,211
But you didn't become
part of a team, did you?

643
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,362
Yeah, but I just roasted them, Coach.
I smoked...

644
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,920
"I, I, I." Everything out of you is

645
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,604
You even understand the concept of a team?

646
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,762
Might be a cliche, son,
but there is no "I" in team,

647
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,046
and there'll be no "I" in this team.

648
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,122
This ain't no team, this is a crew!

649
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,123
And obviously, I'm better than anyone on it!

650
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,570
Congratulations.

651
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,966
Yo, Coach!

652
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,006
Coach!

653
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,763
Yo, I've taken shits bigger than Do Knock.

654
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,490
Sisqo wannabe over there.

655
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,127
It's not right.
Grifter smoked him, roasted him.

656
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,725
That was cold, babe.

657
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,689
- Coach fired off a warning shot.
- Damn right.

658
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,966
Don't give the man what he wants...

659
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,405
You will be gone.

660
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,403
Congratulations, Grifter. You're the best.

661
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,609
- Here's your bus pass.
- You will be gone.

662
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,285
Too bad it wasn't Rooster.

663
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,407
Thank God it wasn't me.

664
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,891
Yeah, word.

665
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,367
- Lot of kicks.
- Oh, yeah.

666
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,206
My sister's husband's cousin's mistress
runs advertising for Puma,

667
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,560
so she hooked us up with some gear.

668
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,324
Am I gonna have a problem with those two?

669
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,402
- Those two?
- Catch up, Franklyn.

670
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,244
What's the deal with Rooster and Do Knock?

671
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,402
They're in the middle
of a really heated Twitter war

672
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,766
-right now, so...
- The point?

673
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,569
They're like Shaq and Kobe.

674
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,483
They used to be real tight,
even ran a crew together.

675
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,164
- So what happened?
- You've seen them.

676
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,083
They both want to be the man.

677
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,491
Got to be more to it than that, man.

678
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,483
A while back, they were both
dating the same chick.

679
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,641
You know how that goes.

680
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,161
Two guys fall in love with the same girl,

681
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,401
settle it with dance.

682
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,209
It's a tale as old as...

683
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,850
...as time.

684
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,210
We got new bags?

685
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,406
We got bags?

686
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,761
- We all get one?
- What?

687
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,286
- Yo!
_l_ley!

688
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,971
Yo, listen up. This came from Dante, man.

689
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,769
You know how much these cost?
These aren't cheap.

690
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,046
I know I can't afford it.

691
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,521
What? No way. I got a PS Vita!

692
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,204
- Are you serious?
- You can control it from the back.

693
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,203
Yo, I got a shaver. Yo, I needed this.

694
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,203
Rebel, you don't have facial hair.

695
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,568
Hey, I'll trade you my camera for that.

696
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,641
It's got everything.

697
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,449
It's like Christmas in here
right now, seriously.

698
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,882
<i>The criterias to judge on are
choreography itself, theme and music,</i>

699
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,803
<i>and if the crew are synchronized.</i>

700
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,407
<i>So the top four crews from the first rounds
are qualified for the second round...</i>

701
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,211
<i>It's real simple, gentlemen.</i>

702
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,248
You don't place among the top four teams,

703
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,971
you don't even get a chance to battle
for the world championship.

704
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,203
In six weeks,
we have an exhibition against Russia.

705
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,965
For us to have any chance,
we must become a team.

706
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,044
And since we've been reminded
there's no "I" in team,

707
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,122
the word "I" is now forbidden.

708
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,567
We will hereafter strike it
from our vocabulary.

709
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,404
Whenever the word "I" comes
out of one of your mouths,

710
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,970
the entire team will do 100 pushups.

711
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,521
You will become "we,"
or we don't stand a chance.

712
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,800
All right, gentlemen, listen up.
We'll begin this nice and easy.

713
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,042
All right, sync drills. Everybody clear?

714
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,369
And five, six, seven, eight!

715
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,725
Feel the guy next to you?

716
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,881
By the Battle of the Year,
we should be able to do this blindfolded.

717
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,530
- You're messing me up, bro.
- Shut up, man.

718
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,331
- I'll smoke you.
- Keep talking, I'm gonna bust your ass.

719
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,644
Did we hear "I" over here?

720
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,125
You know what to do, gentlemen.

721
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,208
One, two...

722
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,806
All right, let's go, let's go!
Time is short here now!

723
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,211
Keep that formation tight.

724
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,367
There it is.

725
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,326
Right!

726
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,970
That's what I'm talking about.

727
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,246
Now we're getting somewhere.

728
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,243
All right, form your lines up.
Let's do it again.

729
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,288
Coach, we just did it, like... Come on, man.

730
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,249
Hold on a second.

731
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,560
This is the Olympics of our sport.

732
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,608
- Shit is crazy.
- What's that, Abbstarr?

733
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,331
Coach, no disrespect,
but b-boying is not a sport.

734
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,368
It's a dance. What we do is an art form.

735
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,487
Yeah, that's right.

736
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,080
All right, hey, listen up.

737
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,207
That's right.

738
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,648
Art versus sport,
very philosophical conversation.

739
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,200
Let's all have a seat. Let's talk about this.

740
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,089
You ever hear of a guy
named Magic Johnson?

741
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,241
- Of course, yeah.
- Of course.

742
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,651
Of course you have.

743
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,609
Played basketball, a sport.

744
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,920
But watching him play,

745
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,606
it's like art, poetry in motion.

746
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,762
Why can't it be both?

747
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,606
Let's form it up, and let's run it again.

748
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,603
We'll be here all night if you want to be!

749
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,330
Now, run it!

750
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,090
That's what I'm talking about. That's it.

751
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,326
Where is he?

752
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,850
Keep going, guys, four more!

753
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,808
What is this? Aren't you supposed to be

754
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,961
-working on the routine?
- We are.

755
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,611
By running them like a chain gang?

756
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,445
Where's Grifter?

757
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,925
He's gone.

758
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,889
- Gone where?
- Cut him.

759
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,810
So you cut one of our best b-boys?

760
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,928
Actually, he was the best.

761
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,841
Let me just make sure
we're on the same page here.

762
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,844
Am I mistaken, or was it not your idea

763
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,571
to take America's best b-boys to the worlds?

764
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,721
You're mistaken.

765
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,167
It was my idea to bring
the best team to the worlds,

766
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,287
which is what we're doing.

767
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,566
Ain't no "we," all right?

768
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,324
- You work for me.
- Back off.

769
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,687
No, you back off. I'm sponsoring this team.

770
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,040
I stuck my neck out for you.

771
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,088
I've been calling you, you don't call me back,

772
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,447
so I got to come down here
to see what's going on,

773
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,522
and you're running my boys into the ground!

774
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,608
Meanwhile, you're a mess.

775
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,684
You smell like you're sweating gin.

776
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,764
And is that vomit on your shoes?

777
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,171
Shoes are Franklyn's.

778
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,287
That's not cool.

779
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,890
I don't got time for this.

780
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,726
I got to get your team
ready for the Russian exhibition.

781
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,048
Get your ass down here.

782
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,730
How hard's he working these guys?

783
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,881
Real hard.

784
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,530
But it's working.

785
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,082
WB might be crazy, D,
but he knows what he's doing.

786
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,446
He's bringing them together.

787
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,726
And how is that?

788
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,002
The enemy of my enemy

789
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,605
is my friend.

790
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,487
Get them inside.

791
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,604
How you feeling, Coach?

792
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,568
- Fine.
- Yeah?

793
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,086
You look like a gazelle out there.

794
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,242
A gazelle with arthritis.

795
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,123
I just wanted to ask you about
the choreographer thing again.

796
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,123
We got the Russians in five weeks.

797
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,645
Yeah...

798
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,246
Get me the best.

799
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,006
Got it.

800
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,171
- Anything else, Franklyn?
- Yeah.

801
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,004
Yeah, I just wanted to thank you.

802
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,764
For what?

803
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,284
For everything.

804
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,647
D said I could learn a lot from you,
and he was right.

805
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,205
He can be a wise man.

806
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,531
Yeah.

807
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,601
<i>We were just in high school and everything,</i>

808
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,569
<i>but being here is definitely,
like, mad emotional.</i>

809
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,005
<i>When you walk through
the hallways, it's like,</i>

810
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,889
<i>that competitor, that's the guy</i>

811
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,769
<i>you're competing against right there,
you know what I mean?</i>

812
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,962
That's it. Don't slow it down!

813
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,570
You're slowing down! Pick it up!

814
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,801
Come on!

815
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,161
Russia's Top 9 has experience on their side.

816
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,765
They've been a team for over 10 years.

817
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,161
They were Battle of the Year
champions in 2010,

818
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,402
known for their artistry,
finesse and showmanship.

819
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,845
Now, run it! Do it again!

820
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,211
...dancing, fellas, it's about

821
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,805
-becoming one, right?
- Should be fine.

822
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,770
He's a little brusque at first,
but you'll get used to it.

823
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:27,366
- Settle down.
- Here he comes.

824
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,680
Who's she?

825
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,046
Choreographer.

826
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,001
She's a girl.

827
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,208
Indeed she is, yeah.

828
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,282
- She's gonna help us win Battle of the Year?
- Yeah.

829
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,850
- A b-girl?
- Yeah.

830
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,400
She's gonna help us flip the script
at the Battle of the Year.

831
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,925
She's coming. We can't whisper anymore.

832
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,047
Stacy. It's nice to meet you.

833
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,768
Blake. Nice to meet you.

834
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,971
So, Franklyn here tells me you're a dancer.

835
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,121
Choreographer.

836
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,531
Right.

837
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,524
Look... Stacy,

838
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,369
I'm just gonna be honest with you here.

839
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,205
I'm afraid in this situation, with the boys,

840
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,883
you might be a bit of a...

841
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,405
An exciting new chapter.

842
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,561
A distraction.

843
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,483
A distraction. Thank you.

844
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,084
Well, maybe we need to teach them
a little bit of focus and discipline.

845
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,849
Trust me, you need me.

846
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,811
Let's meet the boys.

847
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,887
My name is Stacy,
and I'm gonna be your choreographer.

848
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,166
You can teach me whatever you want.

849
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,401
Preferably on the floor!

850
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,561
Are you good with massages, too?

851
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,769
'Cause I have a lot of tension
right here up in my upper thigh region.

852
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,966
Are you done?

853
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,604
Let me explain something to you.

854
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,125
I'm not into boys.

855
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,362
Hey, I like that. That's cool.

856
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,403
- I'm cool with that.
- I don't mind.

857
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,561
I'm into men.

858
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,721
So you and I, we won't have a problem.

859
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,563
- Like that.
- That's cool.

860
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,681
First thing tomorrow morning?

861
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,000
6200.

862
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,764
From the top, clean, five, six, seven, eight.

863
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,002
One, two, three, four...

864
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,242
Look, guys, clean, clean! Stop, stop.

865
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,448
Y'all are supposed to be b-boys.
Come on, let's go!

866
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,368
Kilowatt, you're killing me.

867
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,488
- One, two, three, four...
- All right, hold up, hold up!

868
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,647
Everybody stop.

869
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,926
The hell are you doing, Do Knock?

870
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,128
- What did I do?
_IIIII?

871
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,921
Again?

872
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,764
- Come on, man!
- Idiot. Who's stupid now?

873
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,649
Keep talking, bitch, I'll beat your ass.

874
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,166
Beat me? There's a reason
why you're always in my shadow,

875
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,044
and that's the same reason
Lauren left your punk ass.

876
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,326
- Get your ass up!
- What?

877
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,370
Yeah, that's right.
You was half the man I was.

878
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,402
YO, yo:

879
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,482
You're not gonna stop this?

880
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,361
Hey, hey!

881
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,204
That's enough! Get him back!

882
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,486
Back up! Back up!

883
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,686
That's it!

884
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,526
This about that girl?

885
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,806
Either one of you still with her?

886
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,683
- Huh?
- No.

887
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,649
So let me get this straight.

888
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,121
We used to be friends,
now we're swapping blows over

889
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,282
some girl we're both glad is gone

890
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,089
and who no doubt has hooked up
with some other fool.

891
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,969
That about right?

892
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,326
Let me be crystal clear.

893
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,290
History is exactly that. History!

894
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,681
Fighting ends now! You understand me?

895
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,406
Yes, Coach.

896
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,684
Any one of you even think about fighting,
you will be gone!

897
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,491
This is ridiculous! We're running out of time!

898
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,369
Now, line up and let's run it!

899
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,607
Yo, where'd you get
your b-boy name from, Lil Adonis?

900
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,726
Here.

901
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,723
- What's that?
- That's my mom.

902
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,608
First time I tried a battle, I'm 15.

903
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,923
But my mother, see,
she knows I'm not like the other kids.

904
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,128
I'm scared. I'm gay.

905
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,089
Yeah, he's a mama's boy.

906
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,444
Say all you want about me,

907
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,409
but say one more word about my mother...

908
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,131
We all good in here?

909
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,445
Yeah, we good, Coach.

910
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,121
Lil Adonis?

911
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,606
We all good?

912
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,085
Good, Coach.

913
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,811
Man, these cuts are getting crazy.

914
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,600
Not bad.

915
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,571
You need to let go of your ego.

916
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,206
Something wrong with your watch, Rebel?

917
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,964
No, Coach, it's good.

918
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,804
Then what was so important
to make the rest of us wait?

919
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,843
We battle Russia's top crew
in less than two weeks.

920
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,250
We'd rather not say.

921
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,765
I said, why were we late?

922
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,881
We'd really rather not say.

923
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,011
I said, why were we late?

924
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,888
We had to take a shit.

925
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,450
Getting harder to pick them, huh?

926
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,048
God, each one of these guys
has the moves down.

927
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,043
It isn't about the moves anymore, Franklyn.

928
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,685
It's about chemistry.

929
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,967
Like which dudes are getting along?

930
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,889
Not about that, either.

931
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,841
Record books are filled
with teams that never got along,

932
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,769
championship teams, too.

933
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,084
So, what, then?

934
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,561
Those teams had something else.

935
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,646
The players pushed each other to greatness.

936
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,289
Tell Intricate I need to see him.

937
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,246
Okay.

938
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,324
All right, gentlemen,
tomorrow's the day we've been waiting for.

939
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,521
The Russians are disciplined,
synchronized, precise.

940
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:25,685
Remember, the only way to win this
is going there as a team.

941
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,921
Get some sleep. Tomorrow's the big day.

942
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,650
<i>Tonight's battle features</i>

943
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,327
<i>Russia's Top 9
versus America's Dream Team!</i>

944
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,804
Let's go! Come on!

945
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,001
All right.

946
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,047
Yeah!

947
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,809
Come on!

948
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,166
Let's get 'em, Rebel!

949
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,163
All you, kid, all you.

950
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:17,761
Come on, Rebel.

951
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,761
Yeah.

952
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,806
Yeah!

953
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,720
Let's go, Kid! Come on!

954
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,085
Pow!

955
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,284
Come on. What is this shit?

956
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,130
God damn it!

957
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:35,524
Go, go, go. Come on. Chief, chief, go, go.

958
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,648
All right, let's go!

959
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,401
What's he doing?

960
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,168
Where's your team?

961
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,846
Rooster, get out there!

962
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:06,847
Act like a team!

963
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,806
Damn it!

964
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,721
Where's your team?

965
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,368
- Get off the floor!
- Get off the floor!

966
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,685
You see what you did?

967
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,889
Get 'em outside right now!

968
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,765
Oh, shit.

969
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:48,521
Blake!

970
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,045
Are you gonna talk to them?

971
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,441
I got nothing to say to them
I haven't already said.

972
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,085
Can't believe Coach didn't say
a word to us the whole way back.

973
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,321
It's 'cause you blew it.

974
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,402
- What?
- All of y'all blew it.

975
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,051
Call yourself the Dream Team?
More like the Dreamgirls.

976
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,690
- Look, are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm serious!

977
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,326
- Anis, tell 'em! Back me up!
-It was your fault, Rooster.

978
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,000
What'd you say?

979
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,242
You heard me!
We lost tonight because of you, man!

980
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,607
Because of me? If anything,
I tried to rescue everybody!

981
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:47,886
Yo, I'm over this!

982
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,724
I've heard that same tired shit for years!

983
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,121
Anything happens,
it's always somebody else's fault!

984
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,480
Yo, why you coming at me like this?

985
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,649
'Cause my feet hurt, I'm tired,
and it's your fault, man!

986
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,888
- Yo, what the hell is your problem?
- Listen to your boy, Rooster.

987
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,450
No, you shut up, too! You're as bad as him!

988
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,851
What, you against
the whole world now, Frenchie?

989
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,001
No, just you two assholes!

990
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:06,004
Ever since I walked in these doors,
I gave everything I got in this team!

991
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,330
Everything!

992
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,046
But Coach was right,
this team isn't going nowhere

993
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:13,771
if you two don't get together right now!

994
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,524
Look around you!

995
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,520
Look at these guys!

996
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,321
We got everything we need to win, right here!

997
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,044
To be the best there is!

998
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,122
And you're too goddamn ignorant
to see that!

999
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,123
- You need to check your boy!
- Shut up!

1000
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,283
Guys like you and Rooster,
you might get other chances,

1001
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,011
but for someone like me, this shit is it, man.

1002
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:36,010
I'm never gonna get another
shot at this, ever!

1003
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,566
So I'm taking it,

1004
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,961
even if I gotta punch you in the face
or dog my oldest friend!

1005
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:44,371
I want this, man,
more than anything in my life!

1006
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,482
Question is
what the hell do you two assholes want?

1007
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,401
Rooster! Rooster!

1008
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,765
We need to talk.

1009
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:14,690
There's been too much talk already. Move.

1010
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,250
Why you gotta be such an asshole?

1011
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:19,560
You want to fight? I'm tired of your shit!

1012
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,091
I'm trying to tell you your boy is right.

1013
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,764
Yeah, I know, I'm an ass. I got it.

1014
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,450
No, I'm as much to blame as you are.

1015
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,090
Do you know how talented you are?

1016
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,441
You try a move once, barn, you get that shit.

1017
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:33,489
Me? I got to practice and practice my ass off
just to come close to you!

1018
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:35,085
I've always been jealous of that.

1019
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,361
But that's what got me here.

1020
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,605
You got me here.

1021
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,451
Without that, I don't even make this team.

1022
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,567
Yo, where you going with this, man?

1023
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,761
I want to win!

1024
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,526
I want to win.

1025
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:54,728
We put aside all our old bullshit,
we can win this.

1026
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,370
They need us.

1027
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,081
What about Lauren?

1028
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,448
I broke that off two months before
you guys even hooked up.

1029
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,085
- Really?
- Really.

1030
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,406
So why you been acting all crazy?

1031
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,720
'Cause it pisses you off!

1032
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,609
But I want to squash this right now.

1033
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:10,926
Come on.

1034
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,568
Let's be partners again.

1035
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,130
Just play my music, man.

1036
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,641
Hey, give me a hug, bro.

1037
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,324
- A hug?
- Yeah!

1038
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,561
Give me a hug.

1039
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,844
Come on, man. All right.

1040
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,131
Coach!

1041
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,841
Yo, Coach! Wake up, man. You're late.

1042
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,445
It's after 6:00, we gotta train right now.

1043
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,010
Get out. There's no practice today.

1044
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,009
- Come on. Get up, man.
- Get out of my damn room!

1045
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,246
We aren't going anywhere.

1046
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,527
"We." You don't know shit about "we," son.

1047
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,364
We get it. We screwed up.

1048
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,090
- Come on, let's go.
- You don't tell me shit.

1049
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,571
We're not telling you what to do, Coach.

1050
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:05,051
We're asking.

1051
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,167
Come on, Coach, please.

1052
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,611
Come on, man.

1053
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,964
Training room, 10 minutes.

1054
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,970
Told you.

1055
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,201
We want to win,
we need to change how we think.

1056
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,044
Sound familiar? Success is a choice.

1057
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,805
Every true champion knows
mental game is the key.

1058
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,041
It's our greatest power.

1059
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,441
Most people never touch that power.
Don't even know they have it.

1060
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,965
Go around, doing the same old shit,

1061
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,042
thinking the same old thoughts
every damn day.

1062
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,646
It's why those people will tell you,
"Same shit, different day."

1063
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,690
<i>Truth is the only thing permanent
in this universe is change.</i>

1064
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,285
<i>Instead of griping about these drills,</i>

1065
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,806
<i>choose to say,
"We're giving these drills, our team,</i>

1066
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,689
<i>"our country, every ounce of ourselves."</i>

1067
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,171
<i>Choose to see ourselves as champions.</i>

1068
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,130
<i>Walk, talk, eat, drink, think like champions,</i>

1069
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,531
we become unstoppable.

1070
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,887
We become champions in everything we do.

1071
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,088
All right, it's looking good.
I can see progress.

1072
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,366
- Holy...
- I know you're tired,

1073
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:55,842
but it's the fourth quarter, gentlemen.
Suck it up. Deep breath.

1074
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,289
Let's run it again.

1075
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,725
Tomorrow's Friday.

1076
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,529
Last man standing.

1077
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,122
Can't think of it as cutting the last man.

1078
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,726
Gotta think of it as choosing our final team.

1079
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,131
Yeah?

1080
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,405
Does that make it any easier?

1081
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,925
No, not really.

1082
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,561
Hey, Coach.

1083
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,769
- Hey.
_Hey, baby.

1084
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,802
- All right, see ya.
- See ya.

1085
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,011
Are you really this stupid?

1086
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,287
- Coach, look...
- The rules are very simple.

1087
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,931
Come in.

1088
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,491
It's okay, baby, Daddy's here.

1089
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,606
This is Aleena.

1090
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,490
It's okay, baby. Mama's gonna be back soon.

1091
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,608
- She's beautiful.
- Thank you.

1092
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,045
It's okay.

1093
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:13,804
You ever hear of the Four S's?

1094
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:16,804
- What's that?
- Swaddle, side, shimmy, shush.

1095
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,206
<i>May n</i>

1096
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:20,044
It's okay, baby.

1097
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,690
See, swaddling soothes them.

1098
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,046
Tight, but not too tight.

1099
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,844
Then you turn her on her side like this.

1100
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,929
Then you shimmy back and forth.

1101
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,286
It's not gonna work.

1102
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:35,089
It will, quiet.

1103
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,730
Shushing.

1104
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:46,961
How'd you do that?

1105
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,521
My boy had colic when he was a baby.

1106
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,681
You got a boy?

1107
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,404
It's okay.

1108
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,970
I'll be right back.

1109
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,205
Start talking.

1110
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,165
I'm not gonna leave my family
back in New York, Coach.

1111
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,402
For the last three months,
we've been living off credit cards.

1112
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,209
You been sneaking out
for the last three months?

1113
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,129
It's not every night. It's when I can.

1114
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,130
You can't kick me out, Coach.

1115
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:20,765
Please, not now.

1116
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,889
There are better ways to handle this.

1117
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,327
I don't come from much, Coach.

1118
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,164
All I got is breaking.

1119
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,969
You gotta take care of your family first.

1120
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,530
That's what I'm trying to do, Coach.

1121
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:36,284
Don't you see? This team is my chance
to give Aleena chances I never had.

1122
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:39,569
Chances to know
that we can actually do something

1123
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,331
with our lives if I make it to Battle of the Year.

1124
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,482
Team goes down to the final 13 tomorrow.

1125
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,407
If I don't make top 13, send me home.

1126
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,363
I just want my fair shake, Coach.

1127
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,928
Please don't bus-pass me.

1128
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,445
Don't be late.

1129
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,561
Delivery. From Dante.

1130
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,522
"For France. Burn that goddamn hoodie."

1131
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,405
- What's wrong with my hoodie?
- Nothing.

1132
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,811
It's just very "vagrant chic."

1133
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,211
It's nice.

1134
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,166
Judgment Day.

1135
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,006
Yeah.

1136
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,563
Who you gonna pick?

1137
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,645
I'm not.

1138
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:40,841
You are.

1139
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,926
- Me?
- You.

1140
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,327
I know which man I'd send home.

1141
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,009
Wrote his name on the back.

1142
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,525
Great. Let me see. I'll go get him.

1143
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,001
Coach has gotta know
when his own judgment's biased.

1144
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,885
I can't help feeling my heart's
talking louder than my head.

1145
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,883
Guys have worked too hard.

1146
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,644
Come too far.

1147
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,205
So I'm trusting yourjudgment, Franklyn.

1148
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:05,009
You know them as well as I do.

1149
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,650
No, I can't choose.

1150
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:08,051
Take one down.

1151
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:10,566
What if I pick the wrong guy?

1152
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:11,766
You won't.

1153
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,005
Okay.

1154
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,806
It's not like we're cutting the last man,

1155
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,681
we're just picking the final team.

1156
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,443
You're right, doesn't make it any easier.

1157
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:44,530
Same man.

1158
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,246
Oh, Franklyn...

1159
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,929
You've earned it.

1160
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,366
Thank you, Coach.

1161
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,249
Thank you, Franklyn.

1162
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,401
Yo, Bambino.

1163
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:29,690
I know this is no consolation,
but this was the toughest choice for Coach.

1164
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:32,331
We'll give you a call when we get to France,
won't we, guys?

1165
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,686
- Yeah.
- You better.

1166
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,569
That sucked.

1167
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,881
Hey, gentlemen! Huddle up!

1168
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,530
Let's huddle up!

1169
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,246
All right, listen up.

1170
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,243
We have our final presentation with Dante,

1171
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:53,085
so go back to your dorms, get changed,
meet me back here in an hour.

1172
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,246
And get your passports together.

1173
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,846
Looks like we're going to France!

1174
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:21,684
Dante's at the gate,
so let's run the intro one more time.

1175
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,003
Get in the first formation.
Make sure it's clean.

1176
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:29,288
Here we go.

1177
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:48,168
All right. It's looking great.

1178
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:51,210
Hey, WB,
somebody wants to wish us farewell

1179
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,406
when we go to France.

1180
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,084
Look at WB.

1181
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,208
WB, what's poppin', baby?

1182
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:57,327
Unbelievable!

1183
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,084
How you doing?

1184
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,322
- Look at you.
- Yo, Kamel!

1185
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,920
Man, hey, I been a big fan of yours
since I was about this big.

1186
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,684
- You know me?
- What?

1187
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:06,841
You're like the Michael Jordan of b-boys.

1188
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,166
Hey, meet my friend.

1189
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,441
Hey, Anis, come here, look.

1190
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:13,004
Honored, man.

1191
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:16,925
- Yo, what's good? Sniper.
- What's up, man?

1192
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,689
Yo, let's show them the new move.

1193
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,047
- Now?
- Yeah, come on, let's do it.

1194
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:29,766
Hey, yo, Coach, check this out!

1195
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,410
Five, six, seven, eight...

1196
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:41,010
Rooster!

1197
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,081
- Oh, no.
- Damn.

1198
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,004
Shit.

1199
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,324
Come on, guys, don't watch me pack.

1200
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:09,525
Guys, ever since I was about this big,
it's always been about me.

1201
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:13,124
The Rooster Show.

1202
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,602
But these last three months with you guys,

1203
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,763
being able to
become brothers with you guys...

1204
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,049
I just gotta say

1205
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:28,971
it still is about me.

1206
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,408
As a matter of fact,
I shouldn't even be in this position.

1207
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,561
Do Knock, it should be you.

1208
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,170
Oh, for real?

1209
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:44,448
Anis, make sure you call me, in France,
when y'all win, all right?

1210
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:45,641
Will do, man.

1211
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,526
And tell Bambino he owes me.

1212
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:57,761
Hey, guys...

1213
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:05,202
Act like champions, be champions.

1214
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,690
Come on, say it!

1215
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,210
Act like champions, be champions.

1216
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:16,081
All right, guys, I'll see y'all later.

1217
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,207
- Later, dude.
- Peace, bro.

1218
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,487
- Peace,dude.
- Be safe, man.

1219
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:22,605
Thanks, Coach.

1220
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:24,682
Been an honor, Rooster.

1221
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:37,330
We are going to Battle of the Year to take it.

1222
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,084
Bringin' it back to the US!

1223
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,247
US!

1224
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,405
What up?

1225
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:07,961
Dream Team, baby.

1226
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:37,167
France!

1227
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,810
What time is it? Show time!

1228
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:58,161
Wow. Awesome.

1229
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:01,521
Come over here, Blake.

1230
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:02,840
Let me introduce you
to Thomas Hergenrother,

1231
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:04,251
founder of Battle of the Year.

1232
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:05,810
Welcome to the Battle of the Year Village.

1233
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:07,245
Thank you, Thomas. Glad to be here.

1234
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:08,890
Looking sharp, brother.

1235
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:10,560
Gift from an old friend.

1236
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,081
Let's get inside.

1237
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,290
Damn.

1238
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,082
So, over the next few days,
there's much to do.

1239
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,321
Time is really tight,

1240
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,482
and we have more than 20 crews
coming from all over the world.

1241
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:22,641
All right, Thomas.

1242
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:23,921
- Enjoy your stay.
- Thank you very much.

1243
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,206
All right.

1244
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:27,248
Yo, guys, peep the Germans.

1245
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:28,401
French over there.

1246
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:30,731
There's the Koreans.

1247
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,006
Look at them.

1248
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,366
No one thinks we've got a shot at top four.

1249
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:35,528
Why are they looking at us like that?

1250
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,206
We're Americans, so, automatically,
we're the assholes.

1251
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:40,009
Damn, dude, what's up with that?

1252
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:42,128
That is what you have when you're the best.

1253
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:44,766
Just relax. Go put your stuff away,

1254
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:46,205
see the sights, have some fun.

1255
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,284
Yeah!

1256
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:25,485
Yo, this is where we want to be, fellas!

1257
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,800
And remember, we got curfew at 10:00.

1258
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:29,689
- Damn!
- Dang!

1259
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,569
Flipz and Do Knock got that first set down?

1260
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:32,687
Yes.

1261
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:34,091
Still need to work on that transition...

1262
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:35,491
Blake, they got it.

1263
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:38,484
Don't you everjust stop
thinking about the battle?

1264
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:39,800
I'm sorry.

1265
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,160
It's okay. It's just...

1266
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:43,681
Look around.

1267
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,485
We are in France

1268
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,082
and you worked your ass off to get us here.

1269
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,811
So relax and quit stressing me out.

1270
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:55,691
To Battle of the Year.

1271
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:58,526
To France.

1272
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,366
<i>Welcome to our big opening party
of the Battle of the Year!</i>

1273
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:07,250
<i>The Battle of the Year
is already in its 22nd year.</i>

1274
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:09,846
<i>Don't forget, it's not all about
winning or losing.</i>

1275
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:12,810
<i>The whole world is coming together
to celebrate hip-hop culture.</i>

1276
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:16,368
Yo, Mayhem. I'm-a go to the bathroom.

1277
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:17,726
- I'll be right back.
- All right, man.

1278
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,370
- He's cute. He's cute.
- So, no matter what

1279
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,363
country you're from or what religion,
let's celebrate,

1280
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,124
<i>All Around the World, Same Song.</i>

1281
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,848
To us, Sam boy!

1282
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,126
I'm gonna get a drink. Watch out.

1283
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:34,247
All right!

1284
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,402
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1285
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:38,720
Shit!

1286
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:41,688
- Man, you just spilled my drink!
- I'm sorry.

1287
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:42,886
I don't care if you're sorry, all right?

1288
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,371
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1289
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,885
- You good?
- He's drunk.

1290
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,325
- Are you good right now?
- No, it's not good, all right?

1291
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:49,562
This asshole just came and spilled my drink.

1292
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:50,721
Okay, I'm gonna get you another one.

1293
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,404
I don't care if you get me another one.

1294
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,562
- I was sitting with my friends...
- These your friends?

1295
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:55,721
Drinks on me, everything's cool.

1296
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,167
Fight, fight, fight! Let's go, go, Q0!

1297
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:06,005
Hey, hey, hey! Chill! Chill!

1298
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,566
Yeah.

1299
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:20,851
What?

1300
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,689
All right, Thomas.

1301
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,524
I'll handle it.

1302
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:31,521
Damn it!

1303
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,366
One night!

1304
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:36,649
I give you clowns one night,
and you throw it back in my face.

1305
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,370
- Coach, please let me...
- Shut up.

1306
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:41,523
I can't believe this shit.

1307
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:46,325
You gave them exactly what
they expected, ugly Americans.

1308
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,323
Come on, Coach, you didn't even
let me explain what happen...

1309
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:50,004
I said shut up.

1310
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:53,449
You've learned nothing.

1311
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:54,885
Nothing.

1312
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,010
You're the exact same guys

1313
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:59,889
that walked through my door
three months ago.

1314
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:03,450
And you.

1315
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,005
You started this little dance party.

1316
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,481
You like to hit people? Huh?

1317
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:10,645
Want to take a swing at me?

1318
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:11,846
- No, man.
- Huh?

1319
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,366
WB, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

1320
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,450
Thomas called.

1321
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:17,760
Sniper's been disqualified.

1322
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,649
- You go home tomorrow.
- What?

1323
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:22,485
If Sniper's gone, I'm gone.

1324
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,801
- Don't you test me.
- I'm not.

1325
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:26,206
Yo, if Sniper's going, I'm going.

1326
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:28,486
Me, too, Coach.

1327
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,483
Sorry, Coach, that's right.

1328
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,085
He goes, we all go.

1329
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:42,640
Start talking.

1330
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:44,802
These local punks were trying to start shit.

1331
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,530
All right? They punked Lil Adonis.

1332
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:48,648
That's why Sniper stepped up.

1333
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:49,960
But listen.

1334
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:52,361
A few months ago, Sniper couldn't even sit

1335
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:55,046
at the same table as Adonis.

1336
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:56,645
He couldn't even look at him,

1337
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:58,688
and now he's fighting for him.

1338
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,240
Say what you want, Coach,
but down to a man,

1339
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:04,802
these are not the same guys
that walked through your door that first day.

1340
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,806
You wanted a team.

1341
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:15,725
Well, you got one.

1342
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,523
I gotta call Thomas.

1343
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:46,961
So, what now?

1344
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:48,371
We wait.

1345
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:01,521
Guys! Guys.

1346
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:02,846
Did you talk to Thomas?

1347
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:04,524
Yeah.

1348
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,125
And?

1349
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:08,451
Sniper.

1350
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:09,726
Yes, sir.

1351
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:12,521
You're staying.

1352
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:19,326
Listen up.

1353
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:22,725
It's been a long night.

1354
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:24,566
Get some sleep.

1355
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,369
Big day tomorrow.

1356
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,646
Gentlemen...

1357
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,084
How's it feel to be a team?

1358
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,883
Damn good, Coach.

1359
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,689
<i>My name is Artem Korolev,</i>

01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:55,127
<i>and they're unquestionably led by Fuel,</i>

1382
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:58,249
<i>one of the most legendary
b-boys in the world!</i>

1383
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,926
<i>But let us not forget where
this art form all began.</i>

1384
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,445
<i>- Where was that, Terrence?
-In America!</i>

1385
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:04,887
<i>I love the Dream Team, Dante is my boy.</i>

1386
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,644
<i>I want to see them win, but look,</i>

1387
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:08,370
<i>they've been together 15 minutes.</i>

1388
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:10,841
<i>These other crews have
been together 15 years.</i>

1389
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:13,048
<i>I don't know if they got what
it takes to win this thing.</i>

1390
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:15,241
<i>So give it up</i>

1391
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:19,530
<i>for France, the Left Bank Crew, y'all!</i>

1392
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,689
<i>Give it up for Germany!</i>

1393
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:50,326
<i>The German boys, they came for it.</i>

1394
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:55,284
<i>Israel!</i>

1395
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,324
<i>Let's welcome Belgium!</i>

1396
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,128
<i>Wow! Your boys came to battle!</i>

1397
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:06,765
<i>Make some noise!</i>

1398
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:11,085
<i>Japan!</i>

1399
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:14,210
<i>Make some noise for Greece!</i>

1400
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:19,166
<i>Brazil!</i>

1401
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:21,481
<i>- Switzerland!
-Thailand!</i>

1402
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:24,450
<i>These boys are really
strong, really lean and agile.</i>

1403
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,488
<i>A lot of buzz on this crew right here.</i>

1404
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:30,007
<i>Poland! Taiwan!</i>

1405
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,969
<i>Right now we're witnessing
the most amazing b-boys</i>

1406
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,691
<i>doing absolutely everything they can
to win this competition.</i>

1407
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:36,569
<i>They are sweating blood and tears.</i>

1408
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:48,485
<i>Here we go again!</i>

1409
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:49,846
From Korea...

1410
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:52,241
<i>It's the favorites...</i>

1411
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,322
<i>Seoul Assassins!</i>

1412
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:04,208
I am witnessing the
performance of...

1413
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:06,123
...the world's greatest b-boys.

1414
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:09,245
They are fighting for
their pride and honor.

1415
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:17,486
<i>This is crazy!</i>

1416
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,130
<i>Show stopping, man!</i>

1417
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:33,529
<i>They shutting this crowd down!</i>

1418
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,602
<i>Terrence, have you ever seen
anything like it?</i>

1419
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:53,084
<i>Wow! The Seoul Assassins
are making a statement!</i>

1420
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,043
<i>Man, they're the monsters
on top of the mountain.</i>

1421
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,361
<i>Everybody else is fighting for second place.</i>

1422
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:00,609
<i>You don't want to be the crew
that has to follow that!</i>

1423
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:03,889
<i>If the Dream Team wants to win,
they really gotta bring it.</i>

1424
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:05,530
Guess they liked it.

1425
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,604
That is one tough act to follow, huh?

1426
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:14,601
I could stand here and tell you
it's gonna be easy,

1427
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:16,569
but I won't.

1428
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:19,325
Fact is, the odds and the audience
are stacked against us.

1429
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:23,928
But gentlemen, none of that matters now.

1430
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:29,324
This situation, this place,
is exactly where this team is supposed to be.

1431
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:32,524
Everything we've ever done in our lives,

1432
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:35,723
every decision we've made,
every hour we've trained,

1433
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,962
every drop of sweat we spilled,

1434
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:41,965
has led us to this stage,
at this exact moment.

1435
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:47,845
It is our fate, and it's giving us
a chance at greatness.

1436
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:51,129
A chance to go out there and rip that stage
back from the world champions.

1437
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:54,210
Make that stage ours!
Make that audience ours!

1438
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:58,090
Time to shine, gentlemen.

1439
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,250
Time to shine.

1440
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,963
We were born for this moment, gentlemen.

1441
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,644
- Yeah.
- That's right.

1442
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:21,041
On three. One, two, three!

1443
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:22,406
Dream Team!

1444
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:40,647
<i>And now, from the land of Lady Liberty,</i>

1445
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:43,564
<i>the Dream Team!</i>

1446
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:51,404
What's going on?

1447
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:54,484
<i>This is some overt hating.</i>

1448
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:58,246
<i>I knew after the incident last night
that it was gonna be ugly,</i>

1449
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:01,324
<i>but I don't think anybody
could have imagined this.</i>

1450
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:03,607
<i>Nah, nah, nah,
they don't have any friends here.</i>

1451
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:05,842
<i>Yo, this is the Battle of the Year.
It's all about respect, man.</i>

1452
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,206
<i>Show some love.</i>

1453
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:08,964
<i>They ain't gonna stop, man.</i>

1454
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:11,008
<i>A hard roll just got that much harder.</i>

1455
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:12,206
<i>Let's do this shit.</i>

1456
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:14,084
<i>Amid a blizzard of boos,</i>

1457
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:17,687
<i>the Dream Team's new captain,
Do Knock, kicks off the routine.</i>

1458
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:41,004
<i>This is a journey</i>

1459
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:42,881
<i>into sound.</i>

1460
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:44,246
<i>One, two.</i>

1461
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:45,606
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

1462
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:50,280
<i>The theme of their routine is vital.</i>

1463
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,562
<i>What is the story
they're telling us via the beat?</i>

1464
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:56,008
<i>The audience has to see the story!</i>

1465
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:50,281
<i>They're going step for step, spin for spin.</i>

1466
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:52,408
<i>This is no joke, Sway.</i>

1467
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:55,529
<i>We're talking harmony,
continuity, synchronicity!</i>

1468
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:01,844
<i>In the 1970s,</i>

1469
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:05,163
<i>New York graffiti, rapping, and breaking,</i>

1470
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:07,083
<i>became the prime expressions</i>

1471
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:10,323
<i>of a new young people's
subculture called hip-hop.</i>

1472
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,445
<i>T, look at the Dream Team.</i>

1473
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:56,522
<i>You never seen this before.
They're in perfect sync.</i>

1474
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:58,967
<i>Pop! They're starting to win them over!</i>

1475
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:00,451
<i>I can't believe it!</i>

1476
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:28,763
<i>I'm African-American.</i>

1477
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,128
<i>I'm Cuban-American.</i>

1478
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:34,407
<i>- I'm an Israeli-American.
-I'm a German-American.</i>

1479
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:37,051
<i>- I'm French-American.
-I'm Japanese-American.</i>

1480
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:38,884
<i>I'm Irish-American.</i>

1481
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,121
<i>I'm Russian-American.</i>

1482
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:41,406
<i>I'm an Iranian-American.</i>

1483
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:42,811
<i>Spanish-American.</i>

1484
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,644
<i>I'm an Italian-American.</i>

1485
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:07,967
<i>Wow! They can't see,
but yet they're moving in unison!</i>

1486
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:09,849
<i>This is incredible!</i>

1487
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:26,764
<i>This is a... This is a journey</i>

1488
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,170
<i>into sound.</i>

1489
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:35,327
<i>For the last 15 years, people have said</i>

1490
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:38,961
<i>the US b-boys are selfish,
cocky and got no teamwork skills.</i>

1491
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:41,486
<i>NO more, my man, no more.</i>

1492
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:44,530
<i>We are watching the dawning of a new day!</i>

1493
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:47,126
<i>The Dream Team just destroyed it!</i>

1494
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:48,651
<i>Big ups to those American boys.</i>

1495
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:51,610
<i>Now, I don't know if the judges
are gonna put them in the final four,</i>

1496
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:54,126
<i>but they deserve to go to the final four.</i>

1497
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:01,688
<i>So, Rickie, some of
the world's greatest b-boys</i>

1498
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:04,684
<i>are competing for bragging rights
and national pride here</i>

1499
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,326
<i>at the Battle of the Year championship.</i>

1500
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:15,401
<i>Hey, the scores are in!</i>

1501
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:17,289
<i>I got the final four in my hot hands.</i>

1502
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:21,131
<i>Check this, check this.</i>

1503
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:22,326
<i>Okay, Battle of the Year,</i>

1504
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:25,364
<i>number one seed from Korea!</i>

1505
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,408
<i>Seoul Assassins!</i>

1506
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:35,647
<i>Second seed is from...</i>

1507
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:36,960
<i>France!</i>

1508
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,323
<i>Number three seed...</i>

1509
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,767
<i>from Germany!</i>

1510
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,324
<i>- Okay. ..
-Last, but not least...</i>

1511
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:56,050
<i>...the US of A!</i>

1512
01:29:08,360 --> 01:29:09,964
<i>So, a toast to the judges</i>

1513
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:13,840
whose jaws all hit the ground when they saw
you guys perform today. Good job, fellas.

1514
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,965
Cheers.

1515
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:18,850
That's right.

1516
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:20,331
Cheers.

1517
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:30,286
What?

1518
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:33,285
Oh, my God.

1519
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:34,691
Hey-

1520
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:39,771
Where's the baby?

1521
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,171
With my mom.

1522
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:42,640
Coach.

1523
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:44,360
Meet Jolene.

1524
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:45,845
Hi. So nice to meet you.

1525
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:47,809
- Pleasure. Welcome to France.
- Thanks.

1526
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:49,041
Where'd you get the ticket?

1527
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:51,202
- We all chipped in.
- Consider it a honeymoon.

1528
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:00,370
Look at that.

1529
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:12,810
<i>Once again, it's on.</i>

1530
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:16,407
<i>The Americans and the Germans
have made it to the final four.</i>

1531
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:18,329
<i>Left Bank versus the Dream Team</i>

1532
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:20,607
<i>for the right to battle the reigning champion.</i>

1533
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:21,841
Yeah!

1534
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:27,246
<i>Sway, why don't we break down
the scoring system for our viewers at home?</i>

1535
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:31,006
<i>Now, we have five judges
representing various countries here tonight.</i>

1536
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:33,924
<i>Each judge scores on a scale of one to 10,</i>

1537
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,923
<i>which means a perfect score is 50.</i>

1538
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:43,646
<i>Incredible.</i>

1539
01:30:57,080 --> 01:30:59,128
<i>The Dream Team is all over them.</i>

1540
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,771
<i>Wow, Left Bank is looking desperate now, T.</i>

1541
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:05,564
Come on!

1542
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:07,961
<i>And there it is, Terrence!</i>

1543
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:11,442
<i>The Dream Team wins.
They're going to the final battle.</i>

1544
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:13,891
The Americans really did it.

1545
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,243
They will compete in the finals
against the highly favored Koreans.

1546
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:21,404
The American crewjust left the stage
and I have no words.

1547
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,648
<i>For the first time in 15 years,</i>

1548
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:27,361
<i>the Americans have a chance
to bring home a b-boy world championship</i>

1549
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:30,523
<i>back to American soil where it all began.</i>

1550
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:50,768
Why is everyone looking
so nervous right now?

1551
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,923
We got what we asked for, right?

1552
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:57,040
Us against the Koreans?

1553
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:02,803
And now the entire world is looking at us,

1554
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:05,326
which, if you ask me,
that's how it's supposed to be.

1555
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:07,129
I mean, who created this whole b-boy thing?

1556
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:08,611
- We did.
- Who?

1557
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:09,761
- We did!
- Exactly.

1558
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:12,730
I mean, our generation
may have kicked this whole thing off,

1559
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:14,962
but torch is in your hands now.

1560
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:17,361
So, really only one thing left to do.

1561
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,960
Bring the crown home where it belongs.

1562
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:22,121
Can we do that?

1563
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:23,611
Yes, sir.

1564
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,967
- I said, can we do that?
- Yes, sir!

1565
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,610
That's what I'm talking about.

1566
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:32,605
Two minutes, Dream Team.

1567
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:38,563
Breathe, gentlemen.

1568
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:43,765
Not that much left to say.

1569
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:48,364
They're expecting ugly Americans out there.

1570
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:52,530
Let's show 'em who we really are.

1571
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:55,046
Act like champions.

1572
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:56,691
Be champions!

1573
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:58,366
Let's go.

1574
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:07,123
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

1575
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:10,921
<i>The moment you've all
been waiting for is here!</i>

1576
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:14,724
<i>So we got, from Korea,</i>

1577
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:18,566
<i>please give it up for the Seoul Assassins!</i>

1578
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:27,288
<i>And from the US of A, Dream Team!</i>

1579
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:30,566
<i>All right!</i>

1580
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:35,007
<i>One, two, three!</i>

1581
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:38,086
<i>Let the battle begin!</i>

1582
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:51,641
We got this! We got this! Let's go! Come on!

1583
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:55,403
<i>And here we go.</i>

1584
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:58,484
<i>The Battle of the Year is on.</i>

1585
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:00,767
<i>Kid and Rebel,
they know how to bring the pain.</i>

1586
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:02,046
Come on, boys!

1587
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:18,886
Yeah!

1588
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:34,168
<i>Korea counters with a monster combo.</i>

1589
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:36,288
<i>Absolutely incredible.</i>

1590
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:40,642
<i>See, this is why the Koreans
are considered unbeatable.</i>

1591
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:53,526
Yeah!

1592
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:56,683
<i>Man, that doesn't even seem
humanly possible.</i>

1593
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:59,445
<i>Seoul Assassins are killing it.</i>

1594
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:05,806
Okay.

1595
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:13,525
<i>Flawless synchronization.</i>

1596
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:25,530
<i>Sick moves! These guys have no fear.</i>

1597
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:28,410
<i>This is a battle for world supremacy.</i>

1598
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:34,486
<i>Damn!</i>

1599
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:43,880
<i>Oh, my God,
they're ripping up the floorboards!</i>

1600
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:03,006
<i>The Dream Team's
battling out of their minds,</i>

1601
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:05,162
<i>and the crowd is loving it.</i>

1602
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:07,408
Go! Come on!

1603
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:09,769
<i>Fuel calls out Do Knock!</i>

1604
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:12,047
<i>Fuel is calling for the best of the best.</i>

1605
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:20,441
<i>Fuel unleashes a series of lethal moves!</i>

1606
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:24,730
<i>You're watching a world-class athlete
at the top of his game.</i>

1607
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:30,930
<i>That kind of power move is mind-boggling.</i>

1608
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:39,404
- Yeah!
- Do Knock!

1609
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,525
Yeah, Do Knock!

1610
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:47,411
<i>Do Knock answers
with one-handed rollbacks!</i>

1611
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:49,005
<i>Back and forth, Sway.</i>

1612
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:51,128
<i>They're going blow for blow right now.</i>

1613
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:52,571
<i>TJ, for the first time,</i>

1614
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:55,291
<i>the Assassins seem to be on their heels!</i>

1615
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:13,883
<i>They're giving it everything they have,
but time is winding down.</i>

1616
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:37,720
<i>- Oh, baby, the US strikes...</i>
- Yes!

1617
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:39,370
<i>...with a devastating move!</i>

1618
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:50,489
<i>Korea strikes back with an aerial assault!</i>

1619
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:59,729
<i>Electric, incredible, fantastic!</i>

1620
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:01,529
<i>Who won?</i>

1621
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:04,206
<i>That right there was, pound for pound,</i>

1622
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:07,090
<i>the best battle I've ever seen in my life!</i>

1623
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:11,001
They have given absolutely everything
on the stage. Their heart...

1624
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:14,004
...their souls are on the stage
just now.

1625
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:16,321
<i>- USA! USA! USA!
- Who will bring home the crown</i>

1626
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:17,925
<i>of Battle of the Year world champion?</i>

1627
01:38:20,280 --> 01:38:22,282
<i>I can't believe what I saw!</i>

1628
01:38:22,360 --> 01:38:23,771
<i>- Did you see that?
-What the hell?</i>

1629
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:27,080
<i>I really can't tell
who the winner is, man. You?</i>

1630
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:29,128
<i>- This is gonna be close.
-I don't know, I don't know.</i>

1631
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:30,725
<i>Yo, man, judges' scores are in!</i>

1632
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:43,966
<i>Seoul Assassins by one point.</i>

1633
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:46,520
<i>Terrence, the Koreans win!</i>

1634
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:51,440
Damn.

1635
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:54,520
One point.

1636
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:56,284
One goddamn point.

1637
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:05,411
Well, gentlemen, here we are.

1638
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:09,250
I want you to know something.

1639
01:40:09,320 --> 01:40:11,687
I don't give a damn
what that scoreboard says

1640
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:13,922
or what color the medal is they give you.

1641
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,650
Proud of all of you.

1642
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:18,001
Come on, Coach,
you don't have to sugar-coat it for us.

1643
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:20,765
We didn't accomplish what we came to do.

1644
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:22,205
I wouldn't do that, Sniper.

1645
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:28,043
Look, fellas,

1646
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:32,888
all my life, I've had to consider myself
a fortunate man.

1647
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:36,603
I don't know, things just

1648
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:39,970
kind of went my way.

1649
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:47,645
All that changed two years ago.

1650
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,810
I lost my wife, 15-year-old boy in a car wreck.

1651
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:57,649
And when I lost my family,

1652
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:01,485
I lost my way.

1653
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:05,883
I don't know, I just...

1654
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:09,800
Well, I quit living.

1655
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:16,527
You've all heard me say a million times,

1656
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:20,482
"Change how you think, change your life."

1657
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,331
Fact is,

1658
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:29,329
you've changed the way I think.

1659
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:31,844
You've changed my life.

1660
01:41:34,840 --> 01:41:37,366
First day of training, I had one goal,

1661
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:41,008
teach a crew how to be a team.

1662
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:43,680
We became much more than that.

1663
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:48,691
We became a family.

1664
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:51,929
Something I thought I'd lost forever.

1665
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:55,289
And win or lose, gentlemen,

1666
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:56,771
when you got family

1667
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:00,244
nothing else matters.

1668
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:02,324
But it wasn't supposed
to end like this, Coach.

1669
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:04,448
It's not the ending, Do Knock.

1670
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:05,806
It's the beginning.

1671
01:42:05,880 --> 01:42:08,201
- Wait.
- You coming back next year, Coach?

1672
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:11,407
You kidding me?

1673
01:42:13,200 --> 01:42:14,964
We did all this work to come in second?

1674
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:17,281
Second sucks.

1675
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:21,045
Damn right.

1676
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:23,971
Come on, let's huddle up one more time.

1677
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:35,246
On three.

1678
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:36,731
One, two, three!

1679
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,325
Dream Team!

1680
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:10,931
Do we have to watch that whole thing?

1681
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:14,129
- No.
- Yeah, Roo's right. Take it off.

1682
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:16,967
Hey, you guys needed me.
If I was there, we would have won.

1683
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:18,644
Once an asshole, always an asshole.

1684
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:19,761
I'm just saying.

1685
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:22,841
- Are you for real?
- This guy, man.

1686
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:25,884
Second place, there's nothing wrong with it.
It's just second place.

1687
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:29,487
Guys, tell him what we think about second.

1688
01:43:29,640 --> 01:43:31,324
Second sucks.

1689
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:33,167
It sure does.

1690
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:35,009
I still wish I could have been
there, though, man.

1691
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:37,202
You can be. How much time
you got left on those crutches?

1692
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:39,806
- About six weeks, and I'll be ready.
- There it is.

1693
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:42,804
For the rest of us, though, since we got more
than three months to prepare,

1694
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:44,211
we should start rehearsals on Monday.

1695
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:46,368
- What?
- Come on, Coach.

1696
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:47,561
- We just got back.
- Good idea, Coach.

1697
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:49,324
- We just got back, Coach.
- Really?

1698
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:55,364
Listen up.

1699
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:56,686
My rules are simple.

1700
01:43:57,800 --> 01:43:59,643
Practice starts at 6:00 a.m.

1701
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:01,891
Come at 6:01...
