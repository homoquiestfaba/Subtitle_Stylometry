1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,560
You know what they're saying?

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,870
That you're the ringleader.
That it was all your idea.

3
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,330
You give us who we really want,
we'll get you into a new school...

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,060
wipe your record clean.

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,130
You're just 15 years old.

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,710
He took advantage of your youth.

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,810
- Your ignorance.
- Your innocence.

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,030
You've done a lot of growing up,
haven't you?

9
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:30,320
And now you know the difference
between right and wrong.

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,090
You do know the difference,
don't you?

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,920
Right?

12
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,430
Wrong?

13
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,970
- Don't you?
- Wrong? Right?

14
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:12,239
Cheaters - AKA: Trapaceiros

15
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,970
"What matter here
if I be still the same...

16
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,130
and what I should be
all but less than he...

17
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,370
whom thunder hath made greater.

18
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,060
Here at least we shall be free.

19
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,950
The Almighty hath not built here...

20
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,720
for His envy will not
drive us hence.

21
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,010
Here we may reign secure
and in my choice...

22
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,300
to reign is worth ambition,
though in Hell.

23
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,880
Better to reign in Hell
than serve in Heaven."

24
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,880
Thank you, Asha.

25
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,740
So, what do we think Satan meant
when he said...

26
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,880
"Better to reign in Hell
than serve in Heaven"?

27
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,140
Anything?

28
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,920
Any ideas? Anybody?

29
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,310
Okay. What if you had a choice?

30
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,600
What if you could live
in a mansion in Highland Park...

31
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,120
but you have to be the chauffeur...

32
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,960
or you can live in a shelter
on lower Wacker Drive...

33
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,780
but you would be the king
of that shelter, which would you choose?

34
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,490
If I'm the chauffeur,
what kind of car I drive?

35
00:03:13,854 --> 00:03:17,551
- You ain't even got a license, fool.
- Who the hell you callin' fool, fool?

36
00:03:17,658 --> 00:03:19,990
Who you callin' fool?
You want some?

37
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,564
- Slap that blonde weave off your head.
- Okay. Thank you.

38
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:33,504
Pride, that's what it's all about.

39
00:03:33,607 --> 00:03:36,735
Lucifer was too proud to play runner-up
to someone he felt superior to...

40
00:03:36,844 --> 00:03:38,744
so he set up his own shop.

41
00:03:38,846 --> 00:03:42,077
And what did Dante say was written
on the gates of Lucifer's shop?

42
00:03:42,182 --> 00:03:45,242
"Abandon all hope
ye who enter here."

43
00:03:45,352 --> 00:03:47,411
That's what it should say
on the door to this school.

44
00:03:47,521 --> 00:03:51,582
"And they outcast from God are here
condemned to waste eternal days..."

45
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:53,182
"In woe and pain."

46
00:03:53,293 --> 00:03:55,591
Doesn't sound very pleasant,
does it?

47
00:03:55,696 --> 00:03:58,028
What's the alternative?
Living like a drone?

48
00:03:58,131 --> 00:04:00,861
Why do Adam and Eve get in trouble
in the first place?

49
00:04:00,968 --> 00:04:04,267
- They ate the apple, baby.
- They ate from the tree of knowledge.

50
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:05,861
They just wanted knowledge.

51
00:04:05,973 --> 00:04:09,170
- God was testing them.
- But He didn't tell them why.

52
00:04:09,276 --> 00:04:11,870
He was just, "I'm in charge here.
Do what I say."

53
00:04:11,979 --> 00:04:15,881
And He said, "You can eat from any tree
in the garden, just not from this one."

54
00:04:15,983 --> 00:04:18,850
So, of course, what are they gonna do?

55
00:04:18,952 --> 00:04:21,386
- It's human nature.
- Already been through that, girl.

56
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:25,356
But, hey, that's just my opinion.

57
00:04:35,435 --> 00:04:38,063
Okay, Michael, are you gonna handle
the bowling club again?

58
00:04:39,306 --> 00:04:42,798
Don't let the kids drop their balls
in the gutter.

59
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,708
Sorry. Sorry about that.

60
00:04:45,812 --> 00:04:47,837
All right, good.
Janie?

61
00:04:47,948 --> 00:04:51,213
- How about the prom committee?
- Yes.

62
00:04:51,318 --> 00:04:53,718
Let's try to get started at least
a week before the prom this year.

63
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,378
I'll try.

64
00:04:55,489 --> 00:04:57,753
Wonderful.

65
00:04:57,858 --> 00:05:00,725
Now, the position...

66
00:05:00,827 --> 00:05:02,818
that strikes terror
in all our hearts...

67
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:05,455
brings out the masochist
in the best of us...

68
00:05:05,565 --> 00:05:08,329
coach of the academic
decathlon team... Jerry.

69
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:11,767
What do you say?
Give it another shot?

70
00:05:11,872 --> 00:05:14,306
Couldn't do worse
than he did last time.

71
00:05:14,408 --> 00:05:16,672
That's the nice thing
about finishing last.

72
00:05:18,345 --> 00:05:19,676
Third time's the charm.

73
00:05:58,218 --> 00:06:00,618
Sorry I'm late.

74
00:06:00,721 --> 00:06:03,121
What, is the meeting over?

75
00:06:04,891 --> 00:06:07,917
- Thanks for helping me out.
- Are you kidding? You're helping me out.

76
00:06:08,028 --> 00:06:10,724
You're the only one who thinks we can
compete in anything besides basketball.

77
00:06:10,831 --> 00:06:14,665
Most teachers aren't like you.
They don't like to challenge us.

78
00:06:14,768 --> 00:06:17,999
But you actually think we're capable
of some intelligent thinking.

79
00:06:18,105 --> 00:06:22,269
Jolie, I am continually amazed by the
things that spring out of your mouth.

80
00:06:22,376 --> 00:06:25,812
I'll show you where the smart kids are,
but I can't guarantee they'll show up.

81
00:06:25,912 --> 00:06:28,938
So $40 worth of burritos
will guarantee you an audience.

82
00:06:29,049 --> 00:06:32,314
See that guy over there?
That's Dominik Wesolowski.

83
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:36,753
SATs 1410. 4.0 GPA.

84
00:06:36,857 --> 00:06:38,757
They announced
the honor roll yesterday...

85
00:06:38,859 --> 00:06:40,918
and he made the mistake
of being on it.

86
00:06:41,028 --> 00:06:45,294
Kurgan, Paul.
SATs 1120. 3.8 GPA.

87
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:49,199
I tried to get him on the team last year
but he was busy running for president.

88
00:06:49,302 --> 00:06:52,794
Actually deluded enough
to think he can make a difference.

89
00:06:52,906 --> 00:06:57,707
Agnieska Maryniarczyk.
SATs 370, 3.7 GPA.

90
00:06:57,811 --> 00:06:59,779
She's a virgin.

91
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,713
- Is that relevant?
- If you're her, it is.

92
00:07:02,816 --> 00:07:06,877
Darius Bettus.
1520 on his SATs. 3.9 GPA.

93
00:07:06,987 --> 00:07:09,182
If he weren't so good looking,
I'd have to kill him.

94
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:13,988
Flickas, Irwin. 3.0 GPA.
Has not taken his SATs yet.

95
00:07:14,094 --> 00:07:17,359
Personally, I can't stand him, but he
does have a pretty vivid imagination.

96
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,193
Kur, Matt.
2.9 GPA. SATs 1040.

97
00:07:24,304 --> 00:07:26,602
But look how cute he is.

98
00:07:26,706 --> 00:07:29,869
We're putting a team together,
not a dating pool.

99
00:07:29,976 --> 00:07:32,467
Could be both.

100
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:35,912
Hello, and welcome to
the United States Academic Decathlon...

101
00:07:36,016 --> 00:07:38,484
the nation's foremost
scholastic competition...

102
00:07:38,585 --> 00:07:41,884
where you can match your intellect
with students from top high schools...

103
00:07:41,988 --> 00:07:43,512
across America.

104
00:07:43,623 --> 00:07:47,719
The academic decathlon brings a sense
of pride and accomplishment...

105
00:07:47,828 --> 00:07:49,318
to the high school environment...

106
00:07:49,429 --> 00:07:52,762
placing academic achievement
at the forefront of the school...

107
00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:55,061
and the community at large.

108
00:07:55,168 --> 00:07:57,500
High school students
from all across the country...

109
00:07:57,604 --> 00:08:00,232
compete in this extraordinary event...

110
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,900
pushing themselves to new heights.

111
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:05,910
There are ten exciting areas
in which the students compete...

112
00:08:06,012 --> 00:08:09,641
consisting of written tests
in six core subjects...

113
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:12,309
as well as an oral speech,
an interview...

114
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:14,751
and essay and Super Quiz.

115
00:08:14,855 --> 00:08:17,050
And the winning team
from each state...

116
00:08:17,157 --> 00:08:20,183
will compete for the pride,
prestige and scholarship money...

117
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:22,921
that comes with being
national champion.

118
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:26,192
That winning team gets to go to
the White House and meet the president.

119
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:28,767
The United States
Academic Decathlon...

120
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:32,100
building the skills that work
in corporate America.

121
00:08:35,642 --> 00:08:38,133
Now...
Guys, take it outside.

122
00:08:38,245 --> 00:08:40,372
You wanna know
why you should do this?

123
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,880
So we can embarrass ourselves
in front of the entire city.

124
00:08:44,184 --> 00:08:47,847
Because no one thinks you can.
'Cause you don't think you can.

125
00:08:47,954 --> 00:08:50,946
- Sir, we know we can't.
- Speak for yourself.

126
00:08:51,057 --> 00:08:53,525
I just came here
for the free food.

127
00:09:01,234 --> 00:09:03,134
It's pretty damn funny, isn't it?

128
00:09:03,236 --> 00:09:06,728
The idea of you guys competing
against kids that are really smart.

129
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,673
They're not just smart kids.
Kids from Whitney Young.

130
00:09:09,776 --> 00:09:13,906
Why are you so insecure? We're just
as smart as them. We could beat them.

131
00:09:14,014 --> 00:09:15,743
Don't kid yourself.
It won't be easy.

132
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:18,545
Whitney Young, they live
and breathe the decathlon.

133
00:09:18,652 --> 00:09:21,018
- They've won the state championship...
- Nine years in a row.

134
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:24,557
Nice years in a row.
They recruit for it.

135
00:09:24,658 --> 00:09:26,888
They have unlimited budgets,
air conditioning...

136
00:09:26,993 --> 00:09:28,984
parents who care,
toilets that work.

137
00:09:30,764 --> 00:09:32,095
That's right.

138
00:09:32,966 --> 00:09:35,298
Even a coach
who knows what he's doing.

139
00:09:36,937 --> 00:09:40,532
Which is why when we beat them
it'll be so satisfying.

140
00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:44,636
Do you wanna get into Harvard?
You'll get into Harvard.

141
00:09:44,744 --> 00:09:46,439
On a full scholarship.

142
00:09:46,546 --> 00:09:48,673
You'll be in the newspaper,
on television.

143
00:09:48,782 --> 00:09:53,276
- You're gonna make us famous?
- No, we're gonna make him famous.

144
00:09:55,722 --> 00:09:58,714
I just want you to know
what it feels like to win.

145
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,552
Because once you've had that feeling,
you'll never let it go.

146
00:10:06,566 --> 00:10:10,024
But if we're gonna win
this thing...

147
00:10:10,136 --> 00:10:12,604
here's what I'm gonna need
from you.

148
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,732
Everything.

149
00:10:18,578 --> 00:10:20,876
Spare time?
You aren't gonna have any.

150
00:10:20,981 --> 00:10:24,940
I will need you two hours before
school, five hours after school...

151
00:10:25,051 --> 00:10:27,952
and all day on weekends
and holidays.

152
00:10:28,054 --> 00:10:30,682
You have to be totally committed
and willing to do...

153
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,985
whatever it takes to win.

154
00:10:36,062 --> 00:10:38,155
But understand this.

155
00:10:39,165 --> 00:10:41,725
I will never abandon you.

156
00:10:41,835 --> 00:10:43,735
And I will never hang you
out to dry.

157
00:10:44,471 --> 00:10:46,735
And the knowledge that
I'm prepared to give you...

158
00:10:50,543 --> 00:10:52,773
it will change your life forever.

159
00:10:55,215 --> 00:10:56,773
What do you guys think?

160
00:10:56,883 --> 00:11:00,114
- I think he's a full-on freak.
- I heard he still lives with his mom.

161
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,654
I heard he dates Mr. Silver.

162
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,590
- He's not gay.
- How would you know?

163
00:11:06,693 --> 00:11:09,389
Dr. Plecki's really cool.
Okay?

164
00:11:09,496 --> 00:11:12,988
When we were reading Slaughterhouse
Five, he took us all to meet Vonnegut...

165
00:11:13,099 --> 00:11:15,363
who was doing this reading
and signed all of our books.

166
00:11:15,468 --> 00:11:19,768
And these kids that would rather trip
on a book did an amazing thing.

167
00:11:20,573 --> 00:11:22,336
They actually read the book.

168
00:11:23,643 --> 00:11:26,043
He just wants to help us out.

169
00:11:26,146 --> 00:11:29,445
He's doing this because he thinks we can
compete at something and we're smart.

170
00:11:30,116 --> 00:11:34,246
And we are smart. We just need
an opportunity to prove ourself.

171
00:11:35,555 --> 00:11:38,786
Dr. Plecki's amazing.
He's a really good teacher.

172
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,760
What's he doing here?

173
00:11:56,376 --> 00:12:00,073
I volunteered to coach
the academic decathlon team.

174
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,579
Again?

175
00:12:05,051 --> 00:12:07,713
We've got a really good group
of kids this year.

176
00:12:07,821 --> 00:12:10,517
I think we may have a shot.

177
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,853
It just takes so much time.

178
00:12:18,565 --> 00:12:22,467
I spoke with your brother today. He got
a promotion at the publishing house.

179
00:12:24,337 --> 00:12:27,568
He's now a regional sales manager...

180
00:12:27,674 --> 00:12:30,040
responsible for hiring 20 people.

181
00:12:31,144 --> 00:12:33,044
I have a job, Mother.

182
00:12:34,881 --> 00:12:37,782
I know you do.
I know you do.

183
00:13:00,907 --> 00:13:06,140
How are we supposed to get any studying
done if you show up at 6:18?

184
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,421
A Shakespearean sonnet
is always written in?

185
00:13:17,524 --> 00:13:19,719
I'll take lambic Pentameter
for 500.

186
00:13:19,826 --> 00:13:22,886
- What activates NMDA receptors?
- Glutamate.

187
00:13:22,996 --> 00:13:25,521
If Darius is shooting
four out of seven...

188
00:13:25,632 --> 00:13:28,396
what are the chances of him
making this next shot?

189
00:13:28,501 --> 00:13:30,128
Fifty-seven percent.

190
00:13:30,236 --> 00:13:34,138
What did Ivan discover was the key
to survival in the GULAG?

191
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,300
- Routine. It was the daily routine...
- Booze.

192
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,843
No. Conditioning.

193
00:13:38,945 --> 00:13:41,573
He made himself believe
that one piece of bread was good.

194
00:13:41,681 --> 00:13:43,672
So that when he got two,
he felt great.

195
00:13:43,783 --> 00:13:46,513
What kind of an idiot feels great
with two pieces of bread?

196
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:51,022
Hear how the song repeated the melody
from the beginning? What's that called?

197
00:13:51,124 --> 00:13:52,716
- A da capo.
- Right.

198
00:13:52,826 --> 00:13:55,727
The year 1820 was said to be
the beginning of what musical era?

199
00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:56,955
Romantic Era.

200
00:13:57,063 --> 00:13:59,429
The distinctive characteristic
of the work of Leopold is?

201
00:13:59,532 --> 00:14:01,193
Naturalistic.

202
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:03,496
Eukaryotes differ from
prokaryotes because?

203
00:14:03,603 --> 00:14:05,093
Prokaryotes have no nucleus.

204
00:14:05,205 --> 00:14:07,105
PET measures concentrations of what?

205
00:14:07,207 --> 00:14:09,505
Concentrations of radioactive
isotopes of living tissue.

206
00:14:09,609 --> 00:14:12,976
- What are neurons composed of?
- Cell body, exon and dendrites.

207
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:15,570
Of ancient empires,
the largest was?

208
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,383
I don't know.

209
00:14:18,485 --> 00:14:21,181
Daoism was founded by?

210
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:24,313
The distinctive characteristic
of the work of Leopold is?

211
00:14:39,539 --> 00:14:41,097
No smoking.

212
00:14:57,824 --> 00:15:01,089
Good morning, decathletes. Welcome to...

213
00:15:01,194 --> 00:15:04,288
Here's another question for you.
What do we do to the competition?

214
00:15:04,397 --> 00:15:06,957
- Sweep 'em out of the way!
- That's right.

215
00:15:07,066 --> 00:15:09,330
You are prepared for this.
We are the best team here...

216
00:15:09,435 --> 00:15:11,835
and the only way we won't win
is if we defeat ourselves.

217
00:15:11,938 --> 00:15:13,200
Hands in.

218
00:15:13,306 --> 00:15:15,866
We've got the brains, the hunger.
What are we gonna do?

219
00:15:15,975 --> 00:15:18,068
Win!

220
00:15:18,177 --> 00:15:20,941
Go Whitney! Go Whitney!

221
00:15:21,981 --> 00:15:24,541
Don't worry about them.
We got 'em right where we want 'em.

222
00:15:24,651 --> 00:15:27,142
Overconfident and
underestimating your abilities.

223
00:15:27,253 --> 00:15:30,188
Our abilities? We're not even a factor
in their equation.

224
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,254
You can't control
what they think.

225
00:15:33,359 --> 00:15:36,817
What you can do is remember
everything we've drilled.

226
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,160
Okay? Watch out for lead distracters.

227
00:15:39,265 --> 00:15:42,826
If an answer seems too obvious,
it probably means it's the wrong answer.

228
00:15:42,936 --> 00:15:44,403
Don't second-guess yourselves.

229
00:15:44,504 --> 00:15:46,938
Your first answer is always
your best answer.

230
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,974
- If you draw a blank, you choose...
- "C."

231
00:15:49,075 --> 00:15:52,169
Consistently.
Okay, I taught you discipline.

232
00:15:52,278 --> 00:15:55,805
Use it. And anticipate.
Never panic. Stay focused.

233
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:02,354
Now is your chance to show everyone else
how smart I already know you are.

234
00:16:04,057 --> 00:16:08,426
Do not open your test booklets
until instructed to do so.

235
00:16:08,528 --> 00:16:13,431
You will have 30 minutes to complete
each section of the exam.

236
00:16:13,533 --> 00:16:16,525
At the conclusion of the written portion
of the exam...

237
00:16:16,636 --> 00:16:19,969
you will proceed to the speech
and interview rooms.

238
00:16:20,073 --> 00:16:23,907
Please remember which group
you have been assigned to.

239
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,978
While you are taking
the written test...

240
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,607
keep all books and supplies
under your desk at all times.

241
00:16:30,717 --> 00:16:31,877
Here's 20.

242
00:16:31,985 --> 00:16:34,783
That's what we need,
a little adventurous spirit here.

243
00:16:34,887 --> 00:16:37,549
You never know with these kids.
New kids every year.

244
00:16:37,657 --> 00:16:39,921
You can't count on anything.

245
00:16:40,026 --> 00:16:43,086
Jerry, you wanna get in on this?

246
00:16:43,196 --> 00:16:46,097
Twenty dollars pays...

247
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:49,930
800 for Steinmetz to win.

248
00:16:50,036 --> 00:16:52,266
No guts, no glory.

249
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:52,195
"And if the employer can be part
of the overall solution...

250
00:17:52,298 --> 00:17:54,232
then we will not feel...

251
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:57,825
as much...

252
00:17:57,937 --> 00:17:59,666
'despiring'...

253
00:18:03,276 --> 00:18:05,369
despairing."

254
00:18:05,478 --> 00:18:10,006
Okay, students. It's time for
the Super Quiz. Question number one.

255
00:18:10,116 --> 00:18:14,246
Alteration of the amino acids
of Thermolicyn could...

256
00:18:14,353 --> 00:18:16,617
A: Reduce PKU likelihood...

257
00:18:16,723 --> 00:18:20,124
B: Reduce taste likelihood...
C: Reduce hypertension likelihood...

258
00:18:20,226 --> 00:18:24,287
D: Reduce Down's Syndrome likelihood
and E: None of the above.

259
00:18:24,397 --> 00:18:26,592
The correct answer is "C."

260
00:18:26,699 --> 00:18:29,668
Reduce hypertension likelihood.

261
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:31,293
The correct answer is "E."

262
00:18:31,404 --> 00:18:34,100
The correct answer is "D."
The correct answer is "A."

263
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:39,867
- Are we having fun today?
- Yeah.

264
00:18:39,979 --> 00:18:41,708
I had a lot of fun too.

265
00:18:41,814 --> 00:18:44,578
And did we learn anything?

266
00:18:44,684 --> 00:18:47,244
- Yeah!
- All right!

267
00:18:47,353 --> 00:18:48,843
No big problems?

268
00:18:48,955 --> 00:18:51,515
- None at all. I think it went fantastic.
- Me too.

269
00:18:51,624 --> 00:18:54,787
- So how'd you do?
- Okay, I guess.

270
00:18:54,894 --> 00:18:56,555
That was so easy.

271
00:18:56,662 --> 00:18:59,096
Guys, Alexander Hamilton
was the first chief justice, right?

272
00:18:59,198 --> 00:19:01,098
No, John Jay.

273
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,600
Guys, listen.
I don't care what happens.

274
00:19:03,703 --> 00:19:06,695
I don't care what the final tally is.
I couldn't be more proud of you.

275
00:19:06,806 --> 00:19:10,867
In Language and Literature,
the bronze medal...

276
00:19:10,977 --> 00:19:12,945
from Whitney Young,
Sandy Lee.

277
00:19:13,045 --> 00:19:16,037
Well done, Sandy!

278
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:19,516
The silver medal,
from Whitney Young, Josh Haden.

279
00:19:22,622 --> 00:19:24,647
And the gold medal...

280
00:19:24,757 --> 00:19:27,225
from Whitney Young,
Sarah White.

281
00:19:28,227 --> 00:19:30,923
The bronze medal,
from Whitney Young...

282
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,760
The silver medal,
from Whitney Young...

283
00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:36,232
And the gold medal,
from Whitney Young...

284
00:19:44,811 --> 00:19:48,338
And now,
the five top scoring teams...

285
00:19:48,447 --> 00:19:52,941
who will advance to the Illinois State
Academic Decathlon Finals.

286
00:19:55,555 --> 00:19:56,988
In first place...

287
00:19:57,089 --> 00:20:00,991
for the tenth year in a row,
Whitney Young High School.

288
00:20:03,329 --> 00:20:06,230
Whitney Young is number one!
Whitney Young is number one!

289
00:20:06,332 --> 00:20:09,824
What an accomplishment.
Ten years in a row.

290
00:20:11,304 --> 00:20:13,636
- The winners!
- In second place...

291
00:20:13,739 --> 00:20:15,639
Kenwood Academy.

292
00:20:15,741 --> 00:20:17,641
In third place,
Bogen High School.

293
00:20:17,743 --> 00:20:21,179
In fourth place,
Lane Technical.

294
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,113
And in fifth place,
Steinmetz High School.

295
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:36,161
Jerry, here.
I can't take your money.

296
00:20:36,262 --> 00:20:38,162
You didn't know
what you were up against.

297
00:20:42,501 --> 00:20:44,401
See you at State.

298
00:20:54,902 --> 00:20:56,392
It's not over.

299
00:20:56,504 --> 00:20:58,301
I know it isn't.

300
00:21:00,741 --> 00:21:04,268
Get back at it on Monday.
Study even harder.

301
00:21:04,378 --> 00:21:06,869
Maybe take another trip
to the art institute on Thursday.

302
00:21:10,184 --> 00:21:12,118
I just wish we could've
done better for you.

303
00:21:12,219 --> 00:21:15,552
Please, don't be silly.
You did wonderfully.

304
00:21:22,196 --> 00:21:24,061
Thanks.

305
00:21:24,165 --> 00:21:25,564
Sure.

306
00:22:22,256 --> 00:22:23,188
Fuckin' chair.

307
00:22:24,658 --> 00:22:26,558
Irwin, can I speak with you
for a second?

308
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,560
Yeah. Cool.

309
00:22:30,731 --> 00:22:32,130
What's up?

310
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:36,327
I'm going to switch you
and Dominik for the State.

311
00:22:36,437 --> 00:22:39,235
You had the lowest scores
at the regional competition...

312
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,400
so he's gonna compete at State
and you take the alternate position.

313
00:22:42,509 --> 00:22:45,672
That's not fair. No one told me you
couldn't choose more than one answer.

314
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:48,111
It's called multiple choice.

315
00:22:48,215 --> 00:22:50,080
We'll switch back
if we go to Nationals.

316
00:22:50,184 --> 00:22:53,915
He can barely speak English.
Give me another chance.

317
00:22:54,021 --> 00:22:56,455
- He's your teammate.
- Come on, Plecki.

318
00:22:57,558 --> 00:22:59,992
- Where are you going?
- Work.

319
00:23:00,094 --> 00:23:02,221
- See? He's gotta leave.
- Sit down.

320
00:23:02,329 --> 00:23:05,196
Mr. Butera says he will replace me
if I take any more time off.

321
00:23:05,299 --> 00:23:08,291
- I'll talk to him again.
- That's all right. I should go.

322
00:23:08,402 --> 00:23:10,393
- Would it help if I went with you?
- It won't help.

323
00:23:10,504 --> 00:23:13,064
- I have to be at work.
- Agna, where are you going?

324
00:23:13,173 --> 00:23:15,300
I need to get home
to take care of my sister.

325
00:23:15,409 --> 00:23:18,537
My mother's working late.
I don't want her to be alone.

326
00:23:18,646 --> 00:23:20,773
Nobody else can help?

327
00:23:20,881 --> 00:23:23,406
We have no money
to afford baby-sitter.

328
00:23:24,385 --> 00:23:27,013
Guys, come on.
This is crunch time.

329
00:23:27,121 --> 00:23:30,318
Nothing is supposed to get in the way
of your studying.

330
00:23:30,424 --> 00:23:32,688
If you have to
stay here all night, then...

331
00:23:32,793 --> 00:23:34,954
No one wants to take care of her,
and she's...

332
00:23:35,062 --> 00:23:37,860
Wait a second. Dr. Plecki, I don't know
what world you're living in...

333
00:23:37,965 --> 00:23:40,900
but we finished 12,000 points
behind Young.

334
00:23:41,001 --> 00:23:44,562
- They killed us.
- That's what I'm talking about.

335
00:23:44,672 --> 00:23:47,573
We simply have to work harder.
Whitney Young is working...

336
00:23:47,675 --> 00:23:50,143
so we'll work twice as hard
and beat them.

337
00:23:50,244 --> 00:23:53,077
I appreciate your optimism,
but the fact of this is...

338
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,411
no matter how hard we study
and work for this...

339
00:23:56,517 --> 00:23:59,008
Young is gonna take that thing
for the tenth year in a row.

340
00:24:00,554 --> 00:24:02,215
So if Dominik wants
to keep his job...

341
00:24:02,323 --> 00:24:05,224
and Agnieska wants to make sure
her sister gets fed tonight...

342
00:24:05,326 --> 00:24:07,692
instead of studying...

343
00:24:07,795 --> 00:24:11,390
cytoplasmic binding proteins
all day, that's...

344
00:24:22,176 --> 00:24:24,406
Look, I love the dream
that you gave us.

345
00:24:27,948 --> 00:24:29,506
No, I really do.

346
00:24:31,251 --> 00:24:34,186
But there's a certain point...

347
00:24:34,288 --> 00:24:38,622
where you have to just wake up
and realize...

348
00:24:38,726 --> 00:24:41,456
you know,
it's just a fuckin' dream.

349
00:24:42,329 --> 00:24:43,887
It's just a dream.

350
00:24:47,234 --> 00:24:50,829
- We can't use the copy machine.
- Why not?

351
00:24:50,938 --> 00:24:53,031
Mrs. Fadely says we can't.

352
00:24:55,743 --> 00:25:00,043
You know what they say about Elizabeth.
She has a lot of growing up to do.

353
00:25:00,147 --> 00:25:02,479
Excuse me.

354
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:04,983
I'll call you back.
Excuse me.

355
00:25:05,085 --> 00:25:08,543
- Where do you think you're going?
- To make copies.

356
00:25:08,655 --> 00:25:11,317
- For the decathlon?
- For the decathlon, that's right.

357
00:25:11,425 --> 00:25:15,191
Extracurricular activities
are only budgeted $50 a semester.

358
00:25:15,295 --> 00:25:18,230
- You saying I can't use the machine?
- You exceeded your budget.

359
00:25:18,332 --> 00:25:22,564
- He can make all the copies he wants?
- Athletic department has its own budget.

360
00:25:24,638 --> 00:25:27,573
What is it, a penny a page?
Here.

361
00:25:27,674 --> 00:25:30,575
I hate to take a dime away from
the school board's $4 billion budget...

362
00:25:30,677 --> 00:25:34,010
and do something really outrageous
like spend it on kids.

363
00:25:34,114 --> 00:25:37,379
- You can't make any more copies.
- Go upstairs and tell those kids...

364
00:25:37,484 --> 00:25:40,180
if they wanna be in a basketball
tournament, we'll throw money at 'em...

365
00:25:40,287 --> 00:25:42,881
but if they wanna be in an academic
tournament, they are on their own.

366
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:46,050
- Don't be gettin' smart with me!
- You go tell them.

367
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,890
- Don't come in and get smart with me.
- You go up!

368
00:25:48,996 --> 00:25:51,556
Jerry, what's your record?

369
00:25:51,665 --> 00:25:53,326
My record?

370
00:25:53,434 --> 00:25:56,426
You 0-4, 0-6?
We're 11-0.

371
00:25:56,537 --> 00:25:58,334
Congratu-fuckin'-lations.

372
00:25:58,439 --> 00:26:00,407
That's why I get to use
the machine.

373
00:26:01,475 --> 00:26:04,308
I get it. So, if we don't win,
why even bother trying to compete?

374
00:26:05,245 --> 00:26:06,906
That's not what I'm saying.

375
00:26:07,014 --> 00:26:10,575
If you can't win, you should think twice
about entering the competition.

376
00:26:34,374 --> 00:26:35,602
That you, Jerry?

377
00:26:35,709 --> 00:26:37,973
Yes, Mother, it's me.

378
00:26:38,078 --> 00:26:40,069
Did you remember
the furnace filters?

379
00:26:40,948 --> 00:26:42,848
They're in the car.

380
00:26:50,717 --> 00:26:54,380
That was a tight game we played.
You gonna be around tomorrow?

381
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,011
Definitely.

382
00:26:56,122 --> 00:26:58,682
Yo, yo, Matt.

383
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:01,351
See ya later, man.
What's up?

384
00:27:01,461 --> 00:27:06,296
Listen. You're on that team, right,
the one that takes tests and shit?

385
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:08,867
The academic decathlon.

386
00:27:08,968 --> 00:27:12,199
Listen. If I show you something,
will you give me 20 bucks?

387
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,720
Dad, I gotta take a pee.

388
00:27:48,474 --> 00:27:51,272
- What the hell? I been here ten minutes.
- Sorry, man.

389
00:27:51,377 --> 00:27:52,935
Down here.

390
00:28:16,636 --> 00:28:18,661
Tests, tests, tests.

391
00:28:18,771 --> 00:28:21,069
Shit, they were right here
yesterday.

392
00:28:21,174 --> 00:28:23,540
Damn it.
You're wasting my time.

393
00:28:23,643 --> 00:28:26,578
They're here somewhere.
I know they are.

394
00:28:32,485 --> 00:28:34,146
Here you go.

395
00:28:34,253 --> 00:28:35,652
Beautiful.

396
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:39,119
Let's get out of here.

397
00:28:52,004 --> 00:28:53,972
Here you go.

398
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,552
What the fuck, man?

399
00:29:07,653 --> 00:29:11,521
What's up? I got that copy
of Fantastic Fable you wanted.

400
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:15,219
The one where Starhawk
beats up Pogo. What's that?

401
00:29:16,195 --> 00:29:17,287
Nothin'.

402
00:29:17,396 --> 00:29:19,956
Can't be nothin'.
Let me see it.

403
00:29:20,066 --> 00:29:22,591
- It's nothin', dude.
- Just let me see it.

404
00:29:22,702 --> 00:29:25,398
- Chill out.
- Just let me see it.

405
00:29:27,173 --> 00:29:29,141
Holy shit!

406
00:29:29,242 --> 00:29:31,642
Is this the real thing?

407
00:29:36,716 --> 00:29:38,115
Hello!

408
00:29:39,352 --> 00:29:40,751
What?

409
00:29:44,957 --> 00:29:47,016
Is Dr. Plecki around?

410
00:29:47,126 --> 00:29:49,594
Sure. Come in.

411
00:29:53,699 --> 00:29:54,927
What's going on?

412
00:29:55,034 --> 00:29:56,934
Let's go outside.

413
00:30:03,743 --> 00:30:06,644
- I got the test.
- The what?

414
00:30:06,746 --> 00:30:08,976
I got the test.
Check it out.

415
00:30:09,081 --> 00:30:11,413
Oh, my God!
Where did you get these?

416
00:30:11,517 --> 00:30:15,146
I didn't get 'em. Matt got 'em,
but he wasn't gonna share 'em.

417
00:30:16,923 --> 00:30:19,323
- Look at this. It's the real deal.
- I know.

418
00:30:21,627 --> 00:30:23,993
Are the rest of the children
coming over to study?

419
00:30:25,431 --> 00:30:26,455
Not today.

420
00:30:28,467 --> 00:30:30,059
What's the matter?

421
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:32,797
We should get 'em over here right now.
This is the real deal.

422
00:30:32,905 --> 00:30:36,500
- I don't believe this.
- What's the matter with you? Come on.

423
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,500
I'm a teacher.

424
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,510
I'm a teacher.
I couldn't.

425
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,481
I'm a teacher. I'm supposed
to spout the same platitudes...

426
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:19,141
you've heard
a million times before.

427
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:21,743
"Cheaters don't prosper."
"It's not whether you win or lose...

428
00:31:21,854 --> 00:31:24,049
it's how you play the game."

429
00:31:24,156 --> 00:31:27,057
This may not be approved curriculum,
but guess what.

430
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:31,061
Winning does matter.
Cheaters do prosper.

431
00:31:33,466 --> 00:31:36,799
I'm sure your father came to this
country thinking like mine did...

432
00:31:36,902 --> 00:31:39,268
that a democracy
was a meritocracy.

433
00:31:40,072 --> 00:31:42,734
No one worked harder
than my dad.

434
00:31:46,045 --> 00:31:50,948
He never understood why after giving
24 years of his life to his job...

435
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:55,919
he could get laid off simply so they
could not have to pay his medical bills.

436
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,957
Look, I'm a teacher.

437
00:32:10,836 --> 00:32:12,098
Listen up.

438
00:32:12,204 --> 00:32:15,867
We all know the state competition
is tomorrow.

439
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,535
An opportunity...

440
00:32:18,644 --> 00:32:21,238
has presented itself which...

441
00:32:21,347 --> 00:32:23,941
I would be remiss in not bringing
to your attention.

442
00:32:24,884 --> 00:32:25,976
Paul, wake up!

443
00:32:29,722 --> 00:32:33,214
Now, there are those who don't think
you're mature enough...

444
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:36,454
to make a decision based on the choice
I'm about to offer up.

445
00:32:36,562 --> 00:32:39,224
- I don't think there's a more...
- What is it?

446
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,493
- I got the tests.
- You got the what?

447
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,865
- I got the tests for the state finals.
- I'm the one who got the tests.

448
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:47,962
- You were gonna keep 'em for yourself.
- Shut up, faggot!

449
00:32:48,074 --> 00:32:49,632
Shut up.

450
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,737
Let me see.

451
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,745
Sit down. Sit down!

452
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:02,252
Just be cool.

453
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,050
- No one sees these...
- What?

454
00:33:04,156 --> 00:33:06,420
Unless we are all comfortable
seeing them.

455
00:33:06,525 --> 00:33:10,427
- We do this together or not at all.
- I'm so comfortable with seeing them.

456
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:13,430
Can you see the look on Young's face
when we win? They're gonna shit.

457
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:17,033
- You're okay with this?
- I got the damn things, didn't I?

458
00:33:19,772 --> 00:33:22,332
I wouldn't mind taking a look
at them to...

459
00:33:22,441 --> 00:33:23,772
see how hard they are.

460
00:33:25,144 --> 00:33:28,671
If we can get the tests,
I'm sure Whitney Young has them too.

461
00:33:28,781 --> 00:33:31,716
Of course they do. Doesn't the decathlon
have their offices at Whitney Young?

462
00:33:31,817 --> 00:33:33,717
I mean, you do the math.

463
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:35,844
So, two wrongs make a right?

464
00:33:36,956 --> 00:33:38,321
Two wrongs make it even.

465
00:33:38,424 --> 00:33:40,722
Guys, won't we get caught?

466
00:33:40,826 --> 00:33:44,387
Only if you talk,
and then we'd have you killed.

467
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,869
Okay.

468
00:33:58,344 --> 00:34:00,403
Isn't cheating wrong?

469
00:34:00,513 --> 00:34:04,381
Get down off of your crucifix.
This is the ultimate affirmative action.

470
00:34:04,483 --> 00:34:07,145
- We can level the playing field.
- No one will be pressured into cheating.

471
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:10,222
This isn't about cheating.
This is about winning.

472
00:34:10,322 --> 00:34:13,723
We all know winning isn't everything.
It's the only thing.

473
00:34:27,373 --> 00:34:29,466
What should we do,
Dr. Plecki?

474
00:34:35,881 --> 00:34:38,611
I'm a teacher, so I'm supposed
to spout the same platitudes...

475
00:34:38,717 --> 00:34:40,617
you've heard a million times before.

476
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,620
"Cheaters don't prosper."
"It's not whether you win or lose...

477
00:34:43,722 --> 00:34:45,849
it's how you play the game."

478
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:49,792
Well, this may not be approved
curriculum, but guess what.

479
00:34:49,895 --> 00:34:53,763
Winning does matter.
Cheaters do prosper.

480
00:34:54,366 --> 00:34:57,267
I used to run a business
supporting Irish crystal...

481
00:34:57,369 --> 00:34:59,929
and let me tell you what happens when
you don't pay off the right people...

482
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:02,940
or inflate sales claims
or be creative with your accounting...

483
00:35:03,042 --> 00:35:05,875
you don't stay in business
very long.

484
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:10,282
Try telling the truth on your loan
application, you won't get one.

485
00:35:11,517 --> 00:35:13,849
This is a results-oriented city.

486
00:35:13,953 --> 00:35:16,786
That girl doesn't care about
how that guy got where he is.

487
00:35:16,889 --> 00:35:19,983
All she cares about
is where he is.

488
00:35:20,092 --> 00:35:24,256
Think Bill Gates fired those who stole
Apple's operating code to give to him?

489
00:35:24,363 --> 00:35:26,729
He probably promoted them.

490
00:35:26,832 --> 00:35:31,098
Do you think he would ever send his kids
to a Chicago public school?

491
00:35:33,606 --> 00:35:37,235
They call this place a public school.
Uses public money.

492
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,436
But what it is is a private school...

493
00:35:39,545 --> 00:35:41,513
operating within
the public school system.

494
00:35:42,214 --> 00:35:45,411
These kids get the best education
your tax dollars can buy.

495
00:35:46,385 --> 00:35:50,151
You get to go to school here if your
parents know how to work the system.

496
00:35:50,256 --> 00:35:53,054
Maybe they don't even live
in the city limits...

497
00:35:53,158 --> 00:35:55,524
so they keep a mail drop
in Bucktown or...

498
00:35:55,628 --> 00:35:58,461
they lie about your address...

499
00:35:58,564 --> 00:36:00,691
your income...

500
00:36:00,799 --> 00:36:02,357
your ethnicity.

501
00:36:19,652 --> 00:36:20,949
So?

502
00:36:25,991 --> 00:36:27,618
Okay.

503
00:36:28,994 --> 00:36:32,430
- It's about fuckin' time.
- You okay?

504
00:36:32,531 --> 00:36:35,967
- Where are the answers?
- How about thanks for getting the test?

505
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:39,526
We don't have a lot of time.
Jolie, you take language and lit.

506
00:36:39,638 --> 00:36:40,536
Got it.

507
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:42,197
Matt, music.

508
00:36:42,308 --> 00:36:45,402
Darius, mathematics.

509
00:36:46,312 --> 00:36:47,745
- Right here.
- Science.

510
00:36:48,781 --> 00:36:51,750
Agnieska, take social science.

511
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:54,410
Economics, Dominik.
Flickas, art.

512
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,317
Everybody focus.

513
00:37:11,837 --> 00:37:14,305
I know it's late, but I'm struggling
with this math question...

514
00:37:14,406 --> 00:37:17,500
and I thought since you are
the best math teacher at Steinmetz...

515
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,511
May I speak to somebody
in the music department, please?

516
00:37:32,891 --> 00:37:34,791
What are you doing?

517
00:37:36,996 --> 00:37:38,896
No, it's not.

518
00:37:42,234 --> 00:37:44,225
Burning the midnight oil?

519
00:37:44,336 --> 00:37:47,169
We won't rest until
we're number one, sir.

520
00:37:47,272 --> 00:37:49,797
I like that.
That's the Steinmetz spirit.

521
00:37:49,908 --> 00:37:51,808
I'll try to stop by tomorrow.

522
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:55,277
You definitely should. I think we're
gonna do better than anyone expects.

523
00:37:55,914 --> 00:37:58,974
Very good. All right,
keep up the good work.

524
00:37:59,084 --> 00:38:00,483
We will.

525
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:09,256
I'm sorry.
I couldn't resist.

526
00:38:09,361 --> 00:38:12,091
Okay.
Let's get back to work.

527
00:38:13,399 --> 00:38:16,027
12 "C", 13 "B"...

528
00:38:16,135 --> 00:38:19,571
14 "C", 15 "E"...

529
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:22,971
16 "D", 17 "E"...

530
00:38:23,075 --> 00:38:27,705
18 "D", 19 "E", 20 "A"...

531
00:38:27,813 --> 00:38:32,375
This is a waste of time. Just write
the answers on your hand, man.

532
00:38:32,484 --> 00:38:35,715
What are you doing?
Are you trying to get caught?

533
00:38:35,821 --> 00:38:38,255
If you're gonna cheat,
cheat smart.

534
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:41,087
- Do you have that gum?
- Yeah.

535
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:43,661
You can write the answers
on a stick of gum.

536
00:38:43,762 --> 00:38:46,663
I'm not gonna read answers
off a piece of gum.

537
00:38:46,765 --> 00:38:48,824
We wouldn't wanna cross that line,
would we?

538
00:38:48,934 --> 00:38:52,335
Guys, put 'em on the bottom
of your shoes.

539
00:38:52,438 --> 00:38:54,906
Wait, listen.
Everybody give me your calculators.

540
00:38:55,007 --> 00:38:59,205
I'll program the answers in,
then you can just bring 'em up.

541
00:39:02,047 --> 00:39:04,914
Guys, who's got a beeper?

542
00:39:05,017 --> 00:39:07,781
I mean, we could program them
with the answers.

543
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,815
All right, Agnieska!
Welcome to the team.

544
00:39:13,592 --> 00:39:14,786
Thanks.

545
00:39:14,893 --> 00:39:17,225
I'm telling you,
shoes are the key.

546
00:39:19,164 --> 00:39:22,759
We could wear skirts and we could
write the answers on our thighs.

547
00:39:22,868 --> 00:39:26,463
Yeah, I'm gonna wear a skirt.
I'm not gonna wear a skirt.

548
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,836
I mean, you can wear shorts.

549
00:39:42,387 --> 00:39:45,720
Math answers are 1 "B"...

550
00:39:47,459 --> 00:39:49,859
- I need to speak with you.
- Sure.

551
00:39:49,962 --> 00:39:51,520
In private.

552
00:39:58,003 --> 00:40:01,905
Have you talked to Dominik, 'cause he's
acting like he will still be competing?

553
00:40:02,007 --> 00:40:05,238
We agreed Dominik would compete at State
and you would compete at Nationals.

554
00:40:05,344 --> 00:40:08,313
- Agreed? I got you the exams.
- I know you did.

555
00:40:08,413 --> 00:40:11,348
- I've already sent the names to State.
- That's just crap!

556
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,351
- I can't change that.
- I put my ass on the line.

557
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,683
But you'll reap the rewards
at Nationals.

558
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,155
That's crap.
I can't believe it.

559
00:40:19,258 --> 00:40:22,284
I fuckin' worked my ass off,
I got the fuckin' exams.

560
00:40:22,394 --> 00:40:24,726
Do you wanna participate
in State finals?

561
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:27,094
- Yes!
- Okay, good.

562
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:29,394
I think I know of a way you can.

563
00:40:30,536 --> 00:40:34,267
So then you just press
the "shift" button.

564
00:40:34,373 --> 00:40:36,637
And then the "memory" button...

565
00:40:36,742 --> 00:40:40,439
and all the answers should come up
and then you just scroll through it.

566
00:40:40,546 --> 00:40:42,946
What if a proctor comes by?
What do you press?

567
00:40:43,048 --> 00:40:45,448
- "AC" button clears the whole screen.
- Does it come back?

568
00:40:45,551 --> 00:40:46,518
Yeah.

569
00:40:46,618 --> 00:40:49,644
Remember, nobody's ever gotten
a perfect score on the math section...

570
00:40:49,755 --> 00:40:51,780
so don't set a precedent.

571
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:55,348
Jolie, you get two wrong, Darius, three,
the rest of you at least four or five.

572
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,485
- What?
- Four or five.

573
00:40:57,596 --> 00:41:03,466
I think I should score the highest.
That would arouse the least suspicion.

574
00:41:03,569 --> 00:41:07,130
- I did the best on the essays.
- No, listen.

575
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:10,470
This has already been decided.
No arguing.

576
00:41:15,414 --> 00:41:19,510
Now, don't be surprised if you see Irwin
in the Speech and Interview room.

577
00:41:19,618 --> 00:41:23,384
Each school has to supply
two alumni volunteer judges.

578
00:41:23,488 --> 00:41:25,581
Irwin's gonna get here on his own...

579
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:28,626
and he's gonna disguise himself
using a friend's ID.

580
00:41:29,728 --> 00:41:32,458
Here's your badge, Mr. Tully.

581
00:41:32,564 --> 00:41:35,465
It's nice to have a college volunteer
helping us out.

582
00:41:35,567 --> 00:41:37,592
- Got it?
- Thank you.

583
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:39,762
Come here a second.

584
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:42,500
All right, just remember.

585
00:41:42,608 --> 00:41:44,371
Get some answers wrong.

586
00:41:44,476 --> 00:41:47,639
The only way we get caught
is if we do too well.

587
00:41:47,746 --> 00:41:49,304
All right.

588
00:41:56,054 --> 00:41:57,885
Good morning, decathletes.

589
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,753
Good morning!

590
00:41:59,858 --> 00:42:02,053
Good morning, decathletes,
and welcome...

591
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,596
to the State Finals of Illinois
Academic Decathlon.

592
00:42:11,136 --> 00:42:15,800
What a wonderful thing to see
so many bright young kids here today.

593
00:42:16,508 --> 00:42:17,839
You know...

594
00:42:17,943 --> 00:42:21,106
I was trying to explain
to my 15 year old...

595
00:42:21,213 --> 00:42:24,580
what the academic decathlon
was all about.

596
00:42:24,683 --> 00:42:27,584
And he said...

597
00:42:27,686 --> 00:42:30,382
"You mean those dorks
take tests for fun?"

598
00:42:35,727 --> 00:42:37,592
I thought that was kind of...

599
00:42:37,696 --> 00:42:40,756
But I know that you know
that hard work...

600
00:42:40,866 --> 00:42:43,334
and determ... and dedication...

601
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:46,302
are the keys to achieving
your dreams.

602
00:42:48,173 --> 00:42:50,004
And you are...

603
00:42:50,108 --> 00:42:54,169
And you are our hopes
and our future.

604
00:42:57,883 --> 00:43:01,114
Good luck, decathletes. Let's show
the world all about youth power.

605
00:43:01,219 --> 00:43:02,481
Okay?

606
00:43:03,588 --> 00:43:05,783
Go Whitney! Go Whitney!

607
00:43:30,682 --> 00:43:33,048
Hey, Jerry,
you want in on this?

608
00:43:33,151 --> 00:43:35,346
Remember?

609
00:43:35,454 --> 00:43:37,388
Come on. A buck? Two bucks?

610
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:40,185
Something.
You gotta be in it to win it.

611
00:43:40,292 --> 00:43:42,522
How about a hundred?

612
00:43:42,627 --> 00:43:45,289
- All of it?
- Yeah. I'm feeling lucky.

613
00:43:45,283 --> 00:43:47,046
Everything going as planned?

614
00:43:47,151 --> 00:43:49,881
I had to kill a proctor
who was onto me, but other than that...

615
00:43:51,222 --> 00:43:53,782
Let's go over the signals.
Point up, it's "A".

616
00:43:53,891 --> 00:43:54,880
- To the left ear...
- "B."

617
00:43:54,993 --> 00:43:55,982
- Right ear?
- "C."

618
00:43:56,094 --> 00:43:59,325
To the neck is "D."
Eraser's "E." Got it?

619
00:44:03,468 --> 00:44:07,097
And now, your starting line up
for your Super Quiz.

620
00:44:07,205 --> 00:44:10,299
Introducing from Whitney Young...

621
00:44:10,408 --> 00:44:13,900
The number of base pairs
of human DNA is...

622
00:44:14,012 --> 00:44:16,071
A: Nearly two billion...

623
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,909
B: Nearly three billion...

624
00:44:18,016 --> 00:44:20,280
C: Nearly four billion...

625
00:44:20,385 --> 00:44:23,013
D: Nearly five billion...

626
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:25,351
or E: Nearly six billion?

627
00:44:25,456 --> 00:44:27,549
The correct answer: "B."

628
00:44:30,728 --> 00:44:33,697
DNA fermentation first occur
at which level?

629
00:44:33,798 --> 00:44:35,288
A: P1...

630
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,368
B: P2...

631
00:44:37,468 --> 00:44:38,526
C: P3.

632
00:44:38,636 --> 00:44:40,968
The number of base pairs
of human DNA is...

633
00:44:43,107 --> 00:44:45,302
Lambda exonuclease comes from...

634
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:47,844
Map the 100,000 human genes.

635
00:44:54,819 --> 00:44:59,620
Well, it's been a great day. I see
a lot of anxious faces in the crowd.

636
00:44:59,724 --> 00:45:03,455
I'm just thinking I'll go home
and maybe announce it tomorrow.

637
00:45:05,163 --> 00:45:07,461
Are you ready to find out
what happened here today?

638
00:45:07,565 --> 00:45:10,557
You give me a team cheer if you think
you're gonna take home the medal.

639
00:45:13,338 --> 00:45:14,566
Here we go now.

640
00:45:14,672 --> 00:45:16,640
In Language and Literature...

641
00:45:16,741 --> 00:45:21,007
the bronze medal goes to
Steinmetz's...

642
00:45:21,112 --> 00:45:24,912
Agnieska Maryniarczyk.

643
00:45:26,584 --> 00:45:30,076
The silver medal from Steinmetz,
Darius Bettus.

644
00:45:30,188 --> 00:45:32,782
And the gold goes to
Steinmetz's Jolie Fitch.

645
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:35,688
The bronze medal goes to Steinmetz...

646
00:45:45,136 --> 00:45:47,195
And the winning team.

647
00:45:47,305 --> 00:45:51,105
The winner of the Illinois
Academic Decathlon for 1995...

648
00:45:51,209 --> 00:45:56,112
scoring 49,166 points...

649
00:45:56,214 --> 00:45:57,772
Steinmetz High School.

650
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:14,070
All right.
Steinmetz in the house tonight.

651
00:46:14,179 --> 00:46:15,840
Let's hear it.
Come on now.

652
00:46:18,083 --> 00:46:20,677
Reach to the top, yo
Reach to the sky, The time is high

653
00:46:20,786 --> 00:46:24,187
We're used to be number five
But now we're number one from the slum

654
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:26,190
You know we have more fun
than Whitney Young

655
00:46:26,292 --> 00:46:30,353
Praise to teach and now we on our way
My main man Plecki and the capital "J"

656
00:46:30,462 --> 00:46:34,421
Agnieska on my left, Matt on my right
Darius and Dominik be rockin' tonight

657
00:46:36,535 --> 00:46:40,938
You can't go in there. If one of the
other kids that you judged saw you...

658
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,407
with one of your teammates or if you
got your picture taken by somebody...

659
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,070
It's not fair.
I'm the one that brought you the tests.

660
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:50,273
Just lay low for a while.
Let the hubbub die down.

661
00:46:50,382 --> 00:46:53,476
In a week or so, nobody will remember
you. They won't know your face.

662
00:46:53,585 --> 00:46:55,485
That is bullshit.

663
00:46:56,722 --> 00:46:59,816
- You guys had a hell of a night.
- I know. It's unbelievable.

664
00:46:59,925 --> 00:47:01,449
Yeah, unbelievable.

665
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,118
Tell me about it.

666
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:07,130
I've only got $180, but...

667
00:47:07,232 --> 00:47:10,292
Oh, keep it. Keep it.

668
00:47:10,402 --> 00:47:12,802
You didn't know
what you were up against.

669
00:47:14,139 --> 00:47:17,597
Of course they cheated.
The only question is how.

670
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,405
I understand that.

671
00:47:19,511 --> 00:47:21,604
It's statistically impossible
for any team...

672
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:24,478
to increase their score by 10,000 points
in three weeks.

673
00:47:24,583 --> 00:47:27,450
Just take it easy. No.
Listen to me.

674
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:32,422
You don't jump from a tricycle
to tooling around in a Mercedes.

675
00:47:32,524 --> 00:47:34,492
It's not like the Mavericks
beating the Bulls.

676
00:47:34,593 --> 00:47:36,493
Those kids aren't in the same league.

677
00:47:36,595 --> 00:47:38,825
It's like a bunch of five year olds
beating the Bulls.

678
00:47:38,931 --> 00:47:42,799
Because I don't have proof.
Could you please get me all the scores?

679
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:44,960
And crunch the numbers.

680
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,765
Yes, that's all...

681
00:47:46,872 --> 00:47:48,772
Yes, good. Thanks.

682
00:48:01,353 --> 00:48:03,253
That was so cool.

683
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:07,786
How many of you saw the look
on Haden's face when we won?

684
00:48:07,893 --> 00:48:10,657
That alone was worth the price
of admission. It was so cool.

685
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:13,425
They were such poor losers,
sulking in the corner.

686
00:48:13,532 --> 00:48:16,558
They wouldn't even shake my hand.
They just walked right out.

687
00:48:16,668 --> 00:48:18,795
- Because he thought we cheated.
- We did cheat.

688
00:48:18,904 --> 00:48:21,634
He doesn't know that. He thinks we're
too stupid to win without cheating.

689
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:23,731
- It's so insulting.
- Guys, listen up.

690
00:48:23,842 --> 00:48:26,675
It was amazing what you did.
Really, I look at all the medals.

691
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:29,976
We got medals in Speech and Essay
and Interview competition.

692
00:48:30,082 --> 00:48:34,382
Those are areas we didn't have
any advanced preparation.

693
00:48:34,486 --> 00:48:36,977
Agnieska, your speech was beautiful.

694
00:48:37,089 --> 00:48:39,216
It really was.
And a bronze medal.

695
00:48:39,324 --> 00:48:42,725
Dominik gets a gold
for the essay.

696
00:48:42,828 --> 00:48:47,060
Jolie loses all the answers, and look at
all those medals. I don't believe it.

697
00:48:47,166 --> 00:48:50,158
You were all beautiful.
Just a beautiful job today.

698
00:48:50,269 --> 00:48:52,066
I'm very proud of you.

699
00:48:52,171 --> 00:48:55,163
But now comes
the really hard part.

700
00:48:57,342 --> 00:48:58,775
Keeping quiet.

701
00:49:00,946 --> 00:49:03,813
This will be the real test
of your skills.

702
00:49:03,916 --> 00:49:05,474
Right here.

703
00:49:06,585 --> 00:49:09,782
You cannot say anything.

704
00:49:13,759 --> 00:49:15,659
Not to your parents...

705
00:49:17,729 --> 00:49:20,323
your friends,
if you still have any.

706
00:49:22,034 --> 00:49:24,002
Not to your teachers.

707
00:49:24,102 --> 00:49:27,037
Not even to your priest.

708
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:29,835
You can't.

709
00:49:34,246 --> 00:49:36,771
Benjamin Franklin said...

710
00:49:36,882 --> 00:49:40,147
"The only way three people
can keep a secret...

711
00:49:40,252 --> 00:49:42,482
is if two of them are dead."

712
00:49:47,493 --> 00:49:49,791
Let's see if we can
prove him wrong.

713
00:50:13,685 --> 00:50:15,676
Gonna fly now

714
00:50:17,756 --> 00:50:20,156
Looking strong now

715
00:50:23,095 --> 00:50:24,926
Flying high now

716
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:27,555
Gonna fly now

717
00:50:30,369 --> 00:50:32,200
Gonna fly

718
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:37,604
They said it couldn't be done.

719
00:50:37,709 --> 00:50:41,167
They said that a general enrollment
school could never beat Whitney Young.

720
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,338
They were wrong!

721
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:46,744
Faculty members,
these kids are your creations.

722
00:50:46,852 --> 00:50:49,787
Stand up, faculty members, please.

723
00:50:49,888 --> 00:50:52,186
Let's have a round of applause
for your teachers.

724
00:50:56,295 --> 00:50:58,126
The boos are unnecessary.

725
00:50:58,230 --> 00:51:00,994
But now, most of all...

726
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:02,964
we salute Dr. Jerry Plecki.

727
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:11,069
Jerry, you inspired these kids.
You taught them how to win.

728
00:51:11,176 --> 00:51:13,906
I don't know how you did it...

729
00:51:14,012 --> 00:51:15,707
but I want you to keep doing it.

730
00:51:19,318 --> 00:51:22,116
I notice that we have some media here
and I would assume...

731
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:25,519
we could have some positive images
for our school for a change.

732
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,421
Thank you.

733
00:51:27,526 --> 00:51:32,293
It's true that our school does not have
the most up-to-date facilities.

734
00:51:32,397 --> 00:51:35,457
And we don't have as much money
as some other schools.

735
00:51:35,567 --> 00:51:38,502
But we have something that I believe
is much more important.

736
00:51:38,604 --> 00:51:41,300
- Good weed!
- We have heart.

737
00:51:44,376 --> 00:51:46,936
Years from now they'll still be talking
about the stunning upset...

738
00:51:47,045 --> 00:51:49,240
at the Illinois Academic Decathlon.

739
00:51:49,348 --> 00:51:53,114
The architect of this
amazing triumph is Dr. Jerry Plecki.

740
00:51:53,218 --> 00:51:55,743
We all think Dr. Plecki's
the best.

741
00:51:55,854 --> 00:51:59,381
He taught us if they won't let you in
the front, sneak right in the back.

742
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,789
If it weren't for him,
we wouldn't even be on this team.

743
00:52:01,893 --> 00:52:05,294
There would be no team.
There would be nothing.

744
00:52:05,397 --> 00:52:08,798
- So a lot of studying they had to do?
- Months! Months and months.

745
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:13,166
I mean, holidays, weekends,
the whole deal.

746
00:52:13,271 --> 00:52:14,704
Birthdays, everything.

747
00:52:14,806 --> 00:52:18,139
And you got a place in
your trophy case for all of these?

748
00:52:18,243 --> 00:52:22,304
I'm sleeping with it, actually.
It's gonna replace my teddy bear.

749
00:52:22,414 --> 00:52:25,781
- The Nationals are coming up.
- The Nationals. We're excited about it.

750
00:52:25,884 --> 00:52:28,944
- We're gonna win. You better watch out.
- We're gonna kick some ass.

751
00:52:29,054 --> 00:52:30,954
Did I say that? Sorry.

752
00:52:31,056 --> 00:52:32,580
That's okay.

753
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:34,818
- Thanks, and good luck.
- Thank you.

754
00:52:34,926 --> 00:52:36,257
Hi, Mom.

755
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:38,625
Those kids were in here night and day.

756
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:41,028
They didn't think they were winners
and they are.

757
00:52:41,133 --> 00:52:43,658
All kids need to be
part of a team, right?

758
00:52:43,769 --> 00:52:47,364
And he did that for them.
He made them part of a winning team.

759
00:52:47,472 --> 00:52:51,135
He worked hard, like his father
taught him to work hard.

760
00:52:51,243 --> 00:52:54,906
I wish that his father was alive now
so he could share this joy.

761
00:52:55,013 --> 00:52:58,210
The kids were great. They really
worked hard and, I mean, tireless.

762
00:52:58,316 --> 00:53:00,784
Months and months of...
And it paid off.

763
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,980
Listen, he's so humble,
but he deserves the credit.

764
00:53:04,089 --> 00:53:07,547
It seems all of Chicago is relishing
in this Cinderella story.

765
00:53:07,659 --> 00:53:11,026
But now it's back to the hard work of
studying for the National competition...

766
00:53:11,129 --> 00:53:16,032
which will be held here in Chicago
at Palmer House on April 14.

767
00:53:16,134 --> 00:53:17,567
We wish them well.

768
00:53:17,669 --> 00:53:20,433
Were there any surprises
on the exams?

769
00:53:20,539 --> 00:53:22,507
Not really.
We tried to study everything...

770
00:53:22,607 --> 00:53:25,132
so there would be no surprises.

771
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:28,076
- So what are we gonna do now?
- Do?

772
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:30,910
- At the Nationals?
- We're gonna do well.

773
00:53:31,016 --> 00:53:32,745
- We are?
- Yeah.

774
00:53:32,851 --> 00:53:36,287
So what are we gonna say
when we drop 9,000 points...

775
00:53:36,388 --> 00:53:39,516
and the team from North Dakota
edges us out of 43rd place?

776
00:53:39,624 --> 00:53:41,751
That's not gonna happen.

777
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:45,296
You know what I think? I think
you could've won State without any help.

778
00:53:45,397 --> 00:53:46,830
Please.

779
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:48,695
No, I do. I really do.

780
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,930
All having the test did
was give you a psychological boost.

781
00:53:53,038 --> 00:53:56,337
It's all up here. It's all about having
the confidence, the cockiness...

782
00:53:56,441 --> 00:54:00,104
to think you can do it, to know that
you can beat anybody in that room.

783
00:54:02,414 --> 00:54:04,382
You know what I think?

784
00:54:04,483 --> 00:54:06,815
I think that if I can get
the State tests from DeVry...

785
00:54:06,918 --> 00:54:09,148
I should be able to get the tests
for the Nationals from the same place.

786
00:54:09,254 --> 00:54:11,916
I guarantee they haven't
even tightened security...

787
00:54:12,023 --> 00:54:14,787
because they don't even know
it was breached.

788
00:54:14,893 --> 00:54:16,383
Good, good, good.

789
00:54:16,495 --> 00:54:18,554
Okay if we get some pictures
with everyone?

790
00:54:18,663 --> 00:54:20,392
Absolutely. Come on, guys.

791
00:54:23,535 --> 00:54:27,232
- Get in there tight.
- Always strategizing, huh?

792
00:54:27,339 --> 00:54:28,931
Always.

793
00:54:54,733 --> 00:54:56,928
The following story is true.

794
00:54:57,035 --> 00:54:59,469
The names have been changed
to protect the innocent.

795
00:54:59,571 --> 00:55:01,903
Well, heck, they've been changed
to protect me.

796
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:04,999
I stress the need for total privacy.
Somehow, I...

797
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:07,305
I rushed into Dr. Plicky's house,
thinking if he knew...

798
00:55:07,412 --> 00:55:10,404
how easily the test could be gotten,
he'd call the proper authorities...

799
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:12,676
and launch a full-on investigation.

800
00:55:12,784 --> 00:55:17,448
But when he saw the tests, he got that
sneaky smile he's so used to modeling.

801
00:55:17,556 --> 00:55:19,456
He'd lost control of his senses.

802
00:55:19,558 --> 00:55:21,856
Soon the group began to congratulate me
for such a wondrous deed.

803
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:24,793
My brain spun as they discussed
cheating techniques.

804
00:55:24,896 --> 00:55:26,921
I could almost taste
the madness to come.

805
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:29,091
Dr. Plicky decided I could
help the team even more...

806
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:31,260
by posing as a speech judge.

807
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:33,701
This information came as
a bit of a surprise.

808
00:55:33,805 --> 00:55:37,172
If I'm not competing,
I won't get any recognition whatsoever.

809
00:55:37,275 --> 00:55:41,109
If the decathlon team as a whole
would benefit, Steinmetz would benefit.

810
00:55:41,313 --> 00:55:43,213
I had to do it.

811
00:55:43,315 --> 00:55:45,806
I shook hands with Dr. Plicky
after the contest.

812
00:55:45,917 --> 00:55:47,817
I hope he noticed that would be
the last time...

813
00:55:47,919 --> 00:55:50,183
he would see me holding
any respect for him.

814
00:55:50,288 --> 00:55:54,725
He turned a simple contest among friends
into a competition of deceit.

815
00:55:54,826 --> 00:55:58,057
I now know what it's like
to sell my soul to the devil.

816
00:55:58,163 --> 00:56:01,462
I can't begin to imagine
how my teammates must feel.

817
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:04,160
Guilt must clot their veins.

818
00:56:09,441 --> 00:56:10,669
What is this?

819
00:56:12,444 --> 00:56:13,934
It's a story.

820
00:56:14,045 --> 00:56:15,945
I know that, Irwin.

821
00:56:16,982 --> 00:56:18,882
But is there any truth to it?

822
00:56:18,984 --> 00:56:22,613
Well, I think
that every good writer...

823
00:56:22,721 --> 00:56:24,916
draws on inspiration
from his own life.

824
00:56:25,023 --> 00:56:28,891
It's really a very simple question.

825
00:56:28,994 --> 00:56:31,258
Either you had the tests
or you didn't.

826
00:56:32,464 --> 00:56:33,692
Okay, well...

827
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,391
Here's what happened, see?

828
00:56:37,502 --> 00:56:40,733
I just thought, you know,
what a funny story it would make...

829
00:56:40,839 --> 00:56:43,933
you know if the decathlon team,
you know, the "Cinderella Team"...

830
00:56:44,042 --> 00:56:46,169
that's getting all the attention,
you know...

831
00:56:46,278 --> 00:56:48,769
if they only won 'cause they cheated.

832
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:52,015
How funny would that be?

833
00:56:59,925 --> 00:57:03,827
Irwin has always been one of
our more imaginative writers.

834
00:57:03,929 --> 00:57:06,898
- Thank you.
- He wants to be a screenwriter.

835
00:57:06,998 --> 00:57:08,966
Well, I am a screenwriter, really.

836
00:57:09,067 --> 00:57:12,161
I have written several...

837
00:57:12,270 --> 00:57:16,400
drama and action kind of pieces.

838
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:22,511
Well, Irwin...

839
00:57:22,614 --> 00:57:25,947
I think you've written
a very dramatic story.

840
00:57:26,051 --> 00:57:29,077
- Thank you.
- But I'm not sure you understand...

841
00:57:29,187 --> 00:57:32,054
how damaging this can be
in the wrong hands.

842
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:35,024
You may have written this
as a flight of fancy...

843
00:57:35,126 --> 00:57:38,254
but there are a lot of people out there
who would like nothing better...

844
00:57:38,363 --> 00:57:40,957
than to destroy
the pride and prestige...

845
00:57:41,066 --> 00:57:43,364
and self-esteem
that this win has brought the school.

846
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:47,768
And this may create real problems
for you...

847
00:57:47,872 --> 00:57:50,705
your teammates
and the entire school.

848
00:57:50,809 --> 00:57:52,970
So I have to ask you...

849
00:57:53,078 --> 00:57:55,911
right here and right now...

850
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:57,948
in plain, simple English...

851
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:01,479
is this story true or isn't it?

852
00:58:01,586 --> 00:58:04,214
Yes or no?

853
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:17,227
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

854
00:58:17,335 --> 00:58:20,065
It's a tall tale.

855
00:58:20,171 --> 00:58:24,403
A fantasy. A kind of
sciency fiction thing.

856
00:58:33,151 --> 00:58:35,745
All right. You'll have to write
a recantation.

857
00:58:37,155 --> 00:58:39,055
A what?

858
00:58:39,157 --> 00:58:41,455
You had idle time.

859
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:45,017
You orchestrated
a fictitious story.

860
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:47,189
I can't tell you
exactly what to write.

861
00:58:47,298 --> 00:58:50,392
Just explain why you wrote
what you wrote...

862
00:58:50,502 --> 00:58:52,936
should this thing
ever become an issue.

863
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:58,766
How do you spell "orchestrated"?

864
00:59:00,178 --> 00:59:02,078
- Calm down! Calm down!
- I can't believe you did this!

865
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:04,375
- I changed the names.
- Oh, yeah, "Dr. Plicky"!

866
00:59:04,482 --> 00:59:07,076
- How fucking original.
- I'm gonna tear you apart!

867
00:59:07,185 --> 00:59:09,085
- Guys! Guys!
- He's probably wearing a wire!

868
00:59:09,187 --> 00:59:11,121
I'm not wearing a...
Let's talk about this.

869
00:59:14,426 --> 00:59:16,917
- Stupid motherfucker!
- Leave him alone!

870
00:59:17,028 --> 00:59:18,928
- Sit down!
- Fuck off!

871
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:20,930
- Piece of shit.
- Get back there.

872
00:59:21,032 --> 00:59:22,932
Sit down.

873
00:59:24,035 --> 00:59:26,026
Shut up. Do you understand
why they're upset?

874
00:59:26,137 --> 00:59:28,799
Confessions are for priests...

875
00:59:28,907 --> 00:59:30,772
not English teachers.

876
00:59:30,875 --> 00:59:34,174
You write that kind of story,
make those sorts of explosive charges...

877
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:36,179
who's the one you're hurting, huh?

878
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:38,476
You're the one who's not gonna
go to Nationals.

879
00:59:38,583 --> 00:59:42,576
You're the one admitting stealing tests,
impersonating a judge.

880
00:59:42,687 --> 00:59:44,621
- I've never...
- Look, look.

881
00:59:46,891 --> 00:59:48,882
I understand why you wrote it.

882
00:59:48,993 --> 00:59:50,893
You're upset about not getting
the credit you deserved.

883
00:59:50,995 --> 00:59:53,555
- Yeah!
- All right. I feel badly about that...

884
00:59:53,665 --> 00:59:57,658
but it was too risky for you
to get any kind of media exposure.

885
00:59:57,769 --> 01:00:00,169
If just one kid from another school
recognized you...

886
01:00:00,271 --> 01:00:03,399
as a judge at the competition,
we'd all be in big trouble.

887
01:00:03,508 --> 01:00:06,500
- Especially you.
- I'm so fucking sick of this guy.

888
01:00:06,611 --> 01:00:08,772
Jerry.

889
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:12,748
- Hey, Connie, what's up?
- Can I see you a minute?

890
01:00:12,851 --> 01:00:14,409
Sure.

891
01:00:20,091 --> 01:00:22,491
- Get over here!
- Can we just talk about this?

892
01:00:22,594 --> 01:00:25,461
- I'll talk about my fist in your eye!
- I changed the names!

893
01:00:25,563 --> 01:00:27,155
Get him, get him, get him!

894
01:00:28,399 --> 01:00:30,299
Absolutely. I think so.

895
01:00:30,401 --> 01:00:32,528
Hello, Dr. Plecki.
I'm Joan Isenberg...

896
01:00:32,637 --> 01:00:35,197
from the Illinois Academic
Decathlon Association.

897
01:00:35,306 --> 01:00:37,206
- Hello.
- And this is Bruce McCaully...

898
01:00:37,308 --> 01:00:39,708
from Hartcourt Brace.

899
01:00:39,811 --> 01:00:42,109
I want to congratulate you
on your win, Dr. Plecki.

900
01:00:42,213 --> 01:00:44,113
- Thank you.
- And I want to inform you...

901
01:00:44,215 --> 01:00:46,683
that your team will have to
take the test again.

902
01:00:46,784 --> 01:00:51,949
We've performed random number
probability experiments...

903
01:00:52,056 --> 01:00:57,858
using a mixed model methodology
and utilizing a two-way analysis...

904
01:00:57,962 --> 01:01:00,260
of your team's performance
at State versus Regional.

905
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:04,199
Now, the high and low scores indicates
statistical variances...

906
01:01:04,302 --> 01:01:06,327
beyond normal parameters.

907
01:01:06,437 --> 01:01:08,337
Would you like to put that
in English for us?

908
01:01:08,439 --> 01:01:13,069
Whitney Young's scores went down from
the regional to the state competition.

909
01:01:13,178 --> 01:01:16,375
Your scores went up, way up.

910
01:01:16,481 --> 01:01:19,541
You had the highest scores
in decathlon history.

911
01:01:19,651 --> 01:01:22,916
Yeah, well, that probably has
something to do with us winning.

912
01:01:23,021 --> 01:01:25,922
If I could just take you through...

913
01:01:26,024 --> 01:01:28,891
some of the original scores.

914
01:01:28,993 --> 01:01:31,860
In mathematics, for example.

915
01:01:31,963 --> 01:01:36,696
Kurgan, Paul:
Regionals 300, State 900.

916
01:01:36,801 --> 01:01:42,467
Kur, Matt:
Regionals 175, State 875.

917
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:47,341
Fitch, Jolie:
Regionals 575, State 975.

918
01:01:47,445 --> 01:01:49,606
- Who hired you?
- Dr. McCaully was retained...

919
01:01:49,714 --> 01:01:52,308
by the decathlon committee
after anomalies were detected.

920
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:55,944
Come on. Let's talk about
who's really behind this, okay?

921
01:01:56,054 --> 01:01:58,545
I can just imagine the phone calls
you got from Whitney Young...

922
01:01:58,656 --> 01:02:01,216
demanding to know why
you let us crash their little party.

923
01:02:01,326 --> 01:02:03,988
- We're just doing our job, Dr. Plecki.
- Then good.

924
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:07,064
Why don't you investigate Young's scores
for the past nine years?

925
01:02:07,165 --> 01:02:09,463
You won't because
you're in bed with them.

926
01:02:09,567 --> 01:02:13,128
- Are you questioning my integrity?
- I don't need to.

927
01:02:13,238 --> 01:02:15,365
I call your office,
the phone rings at Whitney Young.

928
01:02:15,473 --> 01:02:18,033
We have not had our office there
for two years.

929
01:02:18,142 --> 01:02:20,872
- Please! The whole system is corrupt.
- That is not true!

930
01:02:20,979 --> 01:02:23,675
Are you, like, serious?

931
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:26,978
Just one second.
Let's be calm here a second.

932
01:02:27,085 --> 01:02:30,612
Dr. Plecki, if you have anything
to say to us, just say it now.

933
01:02:33,024 --> 01:02:35,254
We cheated.

934
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:38,420
We cheated a system that tries
to make it impossible...

935
01:02:38,529 --> 01:02:42,056
for a general-enrollment school, or
anyone who is not Whitney Young, to win.

936
01:02:42,166 --> 01:02:44,066
And that must piss some people off.

937
01:02:44,168 --> 01:02:47,001
You have completely misunderstood
the situation, Dr. Plecki.

938
01:02:47,105 --> 01:02:49,733
- I have not misunderstood anything.
- Oh, for heaven's sake!

939
01:02:49,841 --> 01:02:52,309
- I know exactly what...
- Let's be calm for one second.

940
01:02:54,679 --> 01:02:58,672
What, in your view, do we have to do
to remedy this situation?

941
01:02:58,783 --> 01:03:02,446
Your team has to take
a validation test this Thursday.

942
01:03:02,553 --> 01:03:05,818
And if there's no significant decrease
in the scores...

943
01:03:05,923 --> 01:03:09,154
they'll be eligible to compete
in the Nationals.

944
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:11,023
It's so unfair.

945
01:03:11,129 --> 01:03:14,428
Would they ask Whitney Young
to retake the test? Of course not.

946
01:03:14,532 --> 01:03:17,057
You go to a good school,
and they expect you to do well.

947
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:20,262
It's so much easier to cheat.

948
01:03:20,371 --> 01:03:22,532
What about just taking the test again?

949
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,540
- No, no, no, no.
- What?

950
01:03:24,642 --> 01:03:26,633
You know, we should just sue them.

951
01:03:26,744 --> 01:03:29,144
- For defamation of character.
- Yeah.

952
01:03:29,247 --> 01:03:32,182
- And violation of due process.
- Yeah.

953
01:03:32,283 --> 01:03:34,183
- Pain and suffering.
- Guys, look.

954
01:03:34,285 --> 01:03:38,119
I'm glad to hear we've got a handle on
cause of action, but we're not suing.

955
01:03:38,222 --> 01:03:40,747
- What are we gonna do?
- "What are we gonna do?"

956
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:44,384
We're gonna do some research.

957
01:03:44,495 --> 01:03:49,296
Your students averaged fewer than
four wrong on the multiple choice...

958
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:53,063
where other schools average
14 to 18 incorrect answers.

959
01:03:54,005 --> 01:03:57,634
Then we found out that most of your kids
finished the test with time to spare.

960
01:03:57,742 --> 01:04:00,040
They should be rewarded, not punished.

961
01:04:00,144 --> 01:04:02,135
- That's right.
- In this country...

962
01:04:02,246 --> 01:04:04,737
one is innocent until proven guilty,
not the other way around.

963
01:04:04,849 --> 01:04:07,249
- Those scores wouldn't be questioned...
- Right on.

964
01:04:07,352 --> 01:04:11,812
If my kids did not have Spanish surnames
and come from barrio schools.

965
01:04:11,923 --> 01:04:13,584
You know that!

966
01:04:13,691 --> 01:04:15,852
If you're so confident
of your students' abilities...

967
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:18,360
why not encourage them to retest?

968
01:04:18,463 --> 01:04:20,829
- Why should I?
- If they don't...

969
01:04:20,932 --> 01:04:23,093
everyone will assume they cheated.

970
01:04:23,201 --> 01:04:26,170
Everyone will assume they cheated
if they do!

971
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:29,831
- Bingo.
- I want to see the tests, please.

972
01:04:29,941 --> 01:04:32,739
We feel that by honoring
your demand for a retest...

973
01:04:32,844 --> 01:04:35,074
we would implicitly accede
to the reason behind it...

974
01:04:35,179 --> 01:04:37,147
the suspicion
that cheating has occurred.

975
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:40,274
We thereby notify you, that unless you
have direct evidence of wrongdoing...

976
01:04:40,385 --> 01:04:42,853
we reject your ultimatum
and refuse to be retested.

977
01:04:44,822 --> 01:04:46,585
Well, then...

978
01:04:46,691 --> 01:04:50,718
I have no choice but to proceed
with this course of action.

979
01:04:52,463 --> 01:04:55,762
As a result of scores
that indicate statistical variances...

980
01:04:55,867 --> 01:04:57,767
beyond normal parameters...

981
01:04:57,869 --> 01:05:00,736
and your refusal
to submit to a retest...

982
01:05:00,838 --> 01:05:02,965
you are summarily stripped
of your championship...

983
01:05:03,074 --> 01:05:05,702
and eligibility to participate
in the national competition.

984
01:05:06,711 --> 01:05:09,202
All trophies and medals
should be returned immediately...

985
01:05:09,313 --> 01:05:12,874
to the Illinois Academic Decathlon
Association Representative...

986
01:05:12,984 --> 01:05:14,713
Miss Joan Isenberg.

987
01:05:14,819 --> 01:05:17,788
Miss Isenberg, if you try to take
our championship away...

988
01:05:17,889 --> 01:05:20,084
we will see you in court.

989
01:05:20,191 --> 01:05:22,159
Do what you have to do, Dr. Kiamos...

990
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:25,320
and we'll do what we have to do.

991
01:05:36,908 --> 01:05:39,138
You're those kids
from Steinmetz, right?

992
01:05:39,243 --> 01:05:41,336
Yeah, I saw you guys on TV.

993
01:05:41,446 --> 01:05:43,346
Go kick some ass at Nationals, man.

994
01:05:43,448 --> 01:05:45,712
You know we will, man.
You know we will.

995
01:05:46,984 --> 01:05:48,952
Oh, my God, we are so high up!

996
01:05:49,053 --> 01:05:51,749
- Wow.
- Check this out.

997
01:05:51,856 --> 01:05:54,086
Look at this view, man. Whoa!

998
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,920
- Hi, I'm...
- I know who you are, Dr. Plecki.

999
01:05:59,030 --> 01:06:02,659
We've been expecting you.
I'll show you to the conference room.

1000
01:06:05,536 --> 01:06:07,436
Guys, I think I can see Steinmetz.

1001
01:06:07,538 --> 01:06:09,096
Paul, sit down.

1002
01:06:14,045 --> 01:06:16,172
Hey, guys, I'm sorry
to keep you waiting.

1003
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:18,271
Everything all right here?

1004
01:06:18,382 --> 01:06:23,718
When Constantine told me what they were
trying to do to you, I was outraged.

1005
01:06:23,821 --> 01:06:25,755
It's bullshit. Pardon my French.

1006
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:28,189
I come from the streets,
just like you.

1007
01:06:28,292 --> 01:06:30,351
I didn't go to the right schools.

1008
01:06:30,461 --> 01:06:33,123
I didn't know the right people.
I don't speak the queen's English.

1009
01:06:33,231 --> 01:06:36,962
Everyone assumes I got where I am today
by lying, cheating, stealing.

1010
01:06:37,068 --> 01:06:39,298
- Mr. Clifford?
- What?

1011
01:06:39,403 --> 01:06:42,031
Tell him I'll call him back.

1012
01:06:42,139 --> 01:06:45,336
And by the way,
you didn't cheat, did you?

1013
01:06:50,348 --> 01:06:52,543
All right. I had to ask that.

1014
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:54,811
But, obviously, you know
where my sentiments lie.

1015
01:06:54,919 --> 01:06:56,910
I wouldn't have
taken this case pro bono...

1016
01:06:57,021 --> 01:06:59,888
if I didn't think there was
a real wrong being perpetrated here.

1017
01:06:59,991 --> 01:07:02,357
And that's why I've invited
the press down to meet with you.

1018
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:04,655
The press?

1019
01:07:04,762 --> 01:07:06,662
- To meet us?
- Yeah.

1020
01:07:06,764 --> 01:07:09,096
If we're gonna win this thing, we're
doing it in a court of public opinion.

1021
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:12,192
So sit tight, all right?
All right.

1022
01:07:12,303 --> 01:07:14,203
Look what I'm wearing.

1023
01:07:15,773 --> 01:07:18,298
All right, all right.

1024
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:20,434
As you can see from the press releases
in front of you...

1025
01:07:20,545 --> 01:07:23,514
these young people
are the cream of the crop.

1026
01:07:23,614 --> 01:07:25,514
They're our future leaders.

1027
01:07:25,616 --> 01:07:28,813
Honor roll students
taking AP classes.

1028
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:32,185
But they're here today because they
are accused of being too successful.

1029
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:34,758
Our firm, Robert A. Clifford
and Associates...

1030
01:07:34,859 --> 01:07:38,386
is filing a motion
seeking injunctive relief...

1031
01:07:38,496 --> 01:07:40,430
and a temporary restraining order...

1032
01:07:40,531 --> 01:07:43,557
barring the Decathlon Committee
from stripping the team...

1033
01:07:43,668 --> 01:07:46,728
of its rightfully won title and
its ability to compete at the Nationals.

1034
01:07:49,974 --> 01:07:52,135
Whoa! One question at a time.

1035
01:07:52,243 --> 01:07:54,768
Of the 5,000 students
who took the state tests...

1036
01:07:54,879 --> 01:07:57,609
only 12 scored 900 or better
in the math section.

1037
01:07:57,715 --> 01:07:59,910
Six were from Steinmetz.

1038
01:08:00,017 --> 01:08:03,009
Okay, so we'll try to do better
at the Nationals.

1039
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,554
And of the 105 students
in the state finals...

1040
01:08:05,656 --> 01:08:08,784
only 17 could answer
one difficult calculus problem...

1041
01:08:08,893 --> 01:08:11,157
yet all six from Steinmetz
answered it correctly.

1042
01:08:11,262 --> 01:08:14,322
Props to our math teacher.
You're the best, Dr. Miller.

1043
01:08:14,432 --> 01:08:17,890
How do you explain the high scores,
though? I mean, there must be...

1044
01:08:22,073 --> 01:08:24,940
Hold on. Let me explain.
Can I just say something?

1045
01:08:25,042 --> 01:08:27,033
If we didn't have Polish surnames...

1046
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:29,237
or come from a poor school...

1047
01:08:29,347 --> 01:08:31,508
these scores would never
have been questioned.

1048
01:08:31,616 --> 01:08:33,516
The Steinmetz team's defiance...

1049
01:08:33,618 --> 01:08:35,518
of the state board directives
is being viewed...

1050
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:38,088
as a brave and courageous stance...

1051
01:08:38,189 --> 01:08:41,784
in a city now gripped by
"did they or didn't they" fever.

1052
01:08:41,892 --> 01:08:43,792
Those Whitney Young whiners
should just shut up.

1053
01:08:43,894 --> 01:08:47,591
Learning how to lose gracefully is
just as important as knowing how to win.

1054
01:08:47,698 --> 01:08:51,657
No one's proven these kids guilty.
They worked hard. They're innocent.

1055
01:08:51,769 --> 01:08:54,135
If these kids cheated
and managed to keep it quiet...

1056
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:56,365
they're even more talented
than I thought they were.

1057
01:08:56,474 --> 01:08:59,602
Hey, guys, call me.
I will hire you in a heartbeat.

1058
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:01,701
Absolutely. We reached those heights.

1059
01:09:01,812 --> 01:09:04,906
We achieved those scores.

1060
01:09:05,016 --> 01:09:08,042
Until and unless someone comes along
to prove that we didn't...

1061
01:09:08,152 --> 01:09:10,052
we're going to stand by
this year's scores.

1062
01:09:10,154 --> 01:09:12,884
If it is discovered that they cheated,
should they be stripped of their title?

1063
01:09:12,990 --> 01:09:18,360
All I have is accusations
from people whose voracity I question.

1064
01:09:18,462 --> 01:09:20,930
- I have absolutely no reason...
- Fuck.

1065
01:09:21,032 --> 01:09:24,126
To believe that this isn't...

1066
01:09:24,235 --> 01:09:26,760
a very clear case of people jealous...

1067
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:29,704
of those who they don't expect
to beat them.

1068
01:09:29,807 --> 01:09:32,571
What do you think this says
about the city of Chicago?

1069
01:09:32,677 --> 01:09:36,204
I don't think it says much
about the city itself.

1070
01:09:36,313 --> 01:09:38,213
The school system
might be punished for it.

1071
01:09:38,315 --> 01:09:42,081
But along the lines of the city,
the city's still a very respectful city.

1072
01:09:42,186 --> 01:09:44,814
You don't think this gives us
a black eye nationally?

1073
01:09:44,922 --> 01:09:49,586
Hi. Yes. Can I speak
to a Gloria Abrams, please?

1074
01:10:04,275 --> 01:10:06,743
- Hello?
- Dr. Plecki?

1075
01:10:06,844 --> 01:10:08,835
- Yes?
- This is Gloria Abrams...

1076
01:10:08,946 --> 01:10:10,846
from the Sun-Times.

1077
01:10:13,284 --> 01:10:15,218
How did you get this number?

1078
01:10:15,319 --> 01:10:17,753
Irwin Flickas gave it to me,
and he also gave me...

1079
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:23,487
a very interesting essay concerning
some stolen decathlon materials.

1080
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:25,585
We're going to print it
in tomorrow's paper...

1081
01:10:25,696 --> 01:10:28,756
and I was wondering if
I could get a comment from you.

1082
01:10:29,834 --> 01:10:33,326
Dr. Plecki, do you know Irwin Flickas?

1083
01:10:36,807 --> 01:10:38,707
Dr. Plecki, are you...

1084
01:10:54,992 --> 01:10:58,155
Jerry? You okay?

1085
01:10:58,262 --> 01:11:01,561
I'm fine. Go back to sleep.

1086
01:11:01,665 --> 01:11:03,997
It's okay. Go on.

1087
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:16,631
Jerry?

1088
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:18,935
What the hell are you doing?

1089
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:25,380
Jerry, my paper!

1090
01:13:15,599 --> 01:13:18,397
- Hey, did someone get killed?
- Yeah, you.

1091
01:13:26,644 --> 01:13:28,942
This is so messed up.
I can't believe that he would...

1092
01:13:29,046 --> 01:13:30,946
- This is no good right here.
- Excuse me?

1093
01:13:31,048 --> 01:13:34,575
Get the hell out of here, man!
What are you doing, huh?

1094
01:13:34,685 --> 01:13:36,585
You want some of this?

1095
01:13:40,858 --> 01:13:43,053
Get out of here!

1096
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:45,060
Don't give them what they want!

1097
01:13:45,162 --> 01:13:47,892
I can't fucking believe this!
I'm never gonna get into college now.

1098
01:13:48,999 --> 01:13:51,433
This is ridiculous!

1099
01:13:51,535 --> 01:13:54,436
- I look so fat!
- I'm gonna kill him.

1100
01:13:54,538 --> 01:13:56,904
- Am I that fat, for real?
- Yes, you are.

1101
01:13:57,007 --> 01:14:00,738
- Why would he do that?
- Maybe we should give back the medals.

1102
01:14:00,844 --> 01:14:01,742
What?

1103
01:14:03,347 --> 01:14:06,373
Maybe we should just
end this insanity.

1104
01:14:06,483 --> 01:14:09,941
Let Whitney Young go to Nationals.
Let all this craziness just fade away.

1105
01:14:10,054 --> 01:14:12,921
- Maybe we should just tell the truth.
- No, no, wait! Hold on!

1106
01:14:13,023 --> 01:14:15,617
Hold on! You were the one
that taught us...

1107
01:14:15,726 --> 01:14:18,695
to take charge in each situation,
to get our foot in the door.

1108
01:14:18,796 --> 01:14:21,822
Now you want them to slam it
in our face?

1109
01:14:23,434 --> 01:14:25,334
I mean,
what evidence do they have?

1110
01:14:25,436 --> 01:14:28,269
Some kid wrote an essay
who can't even spell.

1111
01:14:30,274 --> 01:14:32,504
We have to let people know
who Flickas really is.

1112
01:14:32,609 --> 01:14:34,873
He's this kid pissed off
because he's dropped from the team.

1113
01:14:34,979 --> 01:14:36,879
Yeah, yeah, he's just jealous
of our success.

1114
01:14:36,981 --> 01:14:38,881
We don't hate him.
We're not mad at him.

1115
01:14:38,983 --> 01:14:41,975
- Yeah, we feel sorry for this kid.
- We can survive this.

1116
01:14:43,554 --> 01:14:46,853
We can. You taught us
how to survive anything.

1117
01:14:47,992 --> 01:14:50,654
We just have to stick together
and keep our stories straight...

1118
01:14:50,761 --> 01:14:52,661
and take the offensive.

1119
01:14:59,503 --> 01:15:01,061
All right.

1120
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:05,707
But you understand this:

1121
01:15:07,745 --> 01:15:10,043
Things are only going to get worse.

1122
01:15:10,147 --> 01:15:12,672
The media is going to lie to you,
they're gonna threaten you...

1123
01:15:12,783 --> 01:15:15,513
they're gonna try to turn you
against each other.

1124
01:15:15,619 --> 01:15:16,745
So look around.

1125
01:15:19,757 --> 01:15:23,158
Those are the only faces
you can trust.

1126
01:15:24,261 --> 01:15:26,855
- Talk to me!
- Did you cheat? Did you steal the test?

1127
01:15:26,964 --> 01:15:30,422
Get out of here!
Leave my son alone!

1128
01:15:30,534 --> 01:15:32,764
We just want to let him tell
his side of the story!

1129
01:15:32,870 --> 01:15:35,031
If he doesn't defend himself,
who will?

1130
01:15:35,139 --> 01:15:38,905
- I'm coming down there to kick your ass!
- Yeah, beat his ass, Dad!

1131
01:15:39,009 --> 01:15:40,977
Listen to me.
I'll take you to New York.

1132
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:42,978
I'll put you in a nice hotel room.

1133
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:45,776
I could get you courtside seats at
the Bull's game. What's your shoe size?

1134
01:15:45,883 --> 01:15:47,783
Do you like musicals?
I'll take you to Cats.

1135
01:15:47,885 --> 01:15:51,184
Get away from my house!
I've had enough of this!

1136
01:15:51,288 --> 01:15:54,553
Agnieska is not a cheater.
She is a good student! She won!

1137
01:15:54,658 --> 01:15:56,558
Are you sure about this?

1138
01:15:59,296 --> 01:16:01,355
- Out!
- George, keep it going.

1139
01:16:22,686 --> 01:16:25,086
I see your son, this boy here...

1140
01:16:25,189 --> 01:16:27,817
as the bright shining light
in this whole sordid affair.

1141
01:16:27,925 --> 01:16:30,826
The only one with the courage,
with the honesty to come forward...

1142
01:16:30,928 --> 01:16:33,158
and blow the whistle
on those disciples of darkness.

1143
01:16:33,263 --> 01:16:35,231
- So, who's gonna...
- So, who's gonna play me?

1144
01:16:35,332 --> 01:16:37,527
- Shut up. This movie's not about you.
- Wait a minute.

1145
01:16:37,634 --> 01:16:40,159
- Don't tell me to shut up.
- They're making a movie about me!

1146
01:16:40,270 --> 01:16:44,707
All right. Let's examine the essay
for a moment.

1147
01:16:44,808 --> 01:16:48,676
So, first of all, we have
this tragic hero, Irwin Flickas.

1148
01:16:48,779 --> 01:16:53,273
And then there's the suffering victim,
Irwin Flickas.

1149
01:16:53,383 --> 01:16:58,252
And then finally, we have
this redemptive act performed by...

1150
01:16:59,356 --> 01:17:01,483
Irwin Flickas.

1151
01:17:01,592 --> 01:17:04,459
I mean, it's kind of an interesting
profile, don't you think?

1152
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:09,588
- You're wearing the shirt I gave you.
- I gave 'em the usual "whatever."

1153
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:12,533
You didn't have to give an exclusive.
Wow, I got screwed.

1154
01:17:12,636 --> 01:17:14,661
My dad's screaming,
"I'm gonna kick your ass!

1155
01:17:14,771 --> 01:17:16,671
Get the fuck off
my private property."

1156
01:17:16,773 --> 01:17:19,367
Connie Chung's people called me.
They want to take me out for breakfast.

1157
01:17:19,476 --> 01:17:22,707
Jeff, I'm outside the Sheraton
Chicago Hotel and Towers...

1158
01:17:22,813 --> 01:17:26,078
where I've obtained an exclusive
interview with Angela Lam...

1159
01:17:26,183 --> 01:17:29,482
the captain of last year's
Steinmetz Academic Decathlon Team.

1160
01:17:29,586 --> 01:17:33,147
- Switch to channel two.
- All right, all right, all right.

1161
01:17:33,257 --> 01:17:37,193
She says that her former coach,
Dr. Jerry Plecki...

1162
01:17:37,294 --> 01:17:39,956
came to her during the competition
with a slip of paper...

1163
01:17:40,063 --> 01:17:42,691
containing the answers to the Super Quiz
portion of the decathlon.

1164
01:17:42,799 --> 01:17:45,632
Quick, turn to channel two.
Right now.

1165
01:17:47,004 --> 01:17:50,872
- Who is that?
- That girl went to our school.

1166
01:17:50,974 --> 01:17:52,805
I admit it. I cheated.

1167
01:17:52,910 --> 01:17:54,343
This girl's full of it.

1168
01:17:54,444 --> 01:17:56,969
Could be true.
She looks to happy to be on TV.

1169
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,981
Their overall score didn't allow them
to advance to state finals.

1170
01:18:00,083 --> 01:18:02,847
This year's team did much better,
winning the state championship.

1171
01:18:02,953 --> 01:18:07,981
But Lam's admission tonight raises more
questions about this year's victory.

1172
01:18:08,091 --> 01:18:10,525
I'd just like to say to the members
of this year's team...

1173
01:18:10,627 --> 01:18:13,596
if you did cheat,
it's time to come clean.

1174
01:18:13,697 --> 01:18:15,824
- Oh, come on!
- Cheating is not all right.

1175
01:18:15,933 --> 01:18:17,867
It is wrong, wrong, wrong.

1176
01:18:17,968 --> 01:18:21,165
The integrity and morality are more
important than winning the contest.

1177
01:18:21,271 --> 01:18:22,863
Oh, please!

1178
01:18:22,973 --> 01:18:24,804
God, man, what is she doing?

1179
01:18:24,908 --> 01:18:26,842
What's wrong with her?

1180
01:18:26,944 --> 01:18:29,504
This is not good at all.

1181
01:18:29,613 --> 01:18:33,515
In an essay, he claims Steinmetz
obtained an advance copy of the test.

1182
01:18:33,617 --> 01:18:36,643
This comes only weeks after
Steinmetz won the academic decathlon.

1183
01:18:36,753 --> 01:18:39,085
- There you are!
- Mom, please!

1184
01:18:39,189 --> 01:18:41,089
If it wasn't for him,
we wouldn't have gotten caught.

1185
01:18:41,191 --> 01:18:44,957
- Come on. We'll be fine.
- It would suck if we got caught, man.

1186
01:18:45,062 --> 01:18:47,223
But the investigation is ongoing.

1187
01:18:47,331 --> 01:18:50,630
Reporting live from downtown Chicago,
I'm Lisa Martin.

1188
01:18:50,734 --> 01:18:53,635
Dr. Plecki, is Angela Lam
telling the truth?

1189
01:19:05,315 --> 01:19:08,478
- Jerry, go home.
- Okay. Look, I can explain.

1190
01:19:08,585 --> 01:19:11,019
I just got a call from Argie Johnson.

1191
01:19:11,121 --> 01:19:14,284
The school board has ruled that you
are suspended until this mess is over.

1192
01:19:14,391 --> 01:19:17,155
Suspended? On what grounds?

1193
01:19:17,261 --> 01:19:19,786
I don't know. Dereliction of duty,
fucking with other people's livelihoods.

1194
01:19:19,896 --> 01:19:22,729
Take your pick. If you want to see
your union rep, I think you should.

1195
01:19:25,602 --> 01:19:27,900
Can I use the phone in your office?

1196
01:19:28,005 --> 01:19:29,996
You can't conduct business
on school property.

1197
01:19:32,242 --> 01:19:33,800
Where are my kids?

1198
01:19:33,910 --> 01:19:37,209
They're on their way
to the school board headquarters.

1199
01:19:37,314 --> 01:19:40,613
Listen to me.
I've been here 26 years.

1200
01:19:40,717 --> 01:19:44,813
I don't think I'm gonna survive this
debacle. Let me give you some advice.

1201
01:19:44,921 --> 01:19:48,550
By the way, no contact anymore
with the students. That's the ruling.

1202
01:19:48,659 --> 01:19:52,789
I think you should go home, don't answer
the door, don't talk to any reporters.

1203
01:19:52,896 --> 01:19:54,864
Just lie low, okay?

1204
01:19:54,965 --> 01:19:56,865
- Do it?
- Yeah.

1205
01:20:00,037 --> 01:20:01,834
Two minutes! Come on, Plecki!

1206
01:20:01,938 --> 01:20:04,964
Was Angela telling the truth?
Did you cheat last year?

1207
01:20:05,075 --> 01:20:07,475
- Come on, Plecki!
- Talk to us!

1208
01:21:20,050 --> 01:21:22,177
Hi, Jolie.

1209
01:21:22,285 --> 01:21:24,810
My name is Jerry Marconi,
and this is Corinne Davis.

1210
01:21:24,921 --> 01:21:27,048
We're attorneys working
with the board of education.

1211
01:21:27,157 --> 01:21:30,092
Now, we know that cheating occurred.
That's a given.

1212
01:21:31,027 --> 01:21:34,019
What we need to know now
is whether Dr. Plecki stole the tests.

1213
01:21:34,131 --> 01:21:37,328
- Coerced you into looking at them.
- Threatened you if you talked.

1214
01:21:37,434 --> 01:21:38,958
- Offered you alcohol.
- Drugs.

1215
01:21:39,069 --> 01:21:41,537
- Sex.
- That doesn't matter.

1216
01:21:41,638 --> 01:21:43,902
You're just a kid.
He took advantage of your youth.

1217
01:21:44,007 --> 01:21:46,601
- Your stupidity.
- Your innocence.

1218
01:21:47,477 --> 01:21:49,945
You did a lot of growing up lately,
haven't you?

1219
01:21:51,081 --> 01:21:54,482
And now you know the difference
between right and wrong.

1220
01:21:54,584 --> 01:21:57,951
You do know the difference
between right and wrong, don't you?

1221
01:22:00,056 --> 01:22:01,580
Right?

1222
01:22:03,326 --> 01:22:04,486
Wrong?

1223
01:22:06,530 --> 01:22:07,997
Don't you?

1224
01:22:11,468 --> 01:22:13,095
- We didn't cheat.
- We didn't cheat.

1225
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:36,592
Well, well, well!
Look what I just got.

1226
01:22:38,361 --> 01:22:40,693
Signed confessions
from your teammates.

1227
01:22:41,932 --> 01:22:45,663
And guess what they're saying.
That you were the ringleader.

1228
01:22:46,736 --> 01:22:49,296
That is was all your idea.

1229
01:23:00,283 --> 01:23:03,548
Come on, Dominik.
It's time to get it off your chest.

1230
01:23:04,788 --> 01:23:06,847
You're a good Catholic like me.

1231
01:23:06,957 --> 01:23:09,983
We both go to church,
share the same confessor.

1232
01:23:10,093 --> 01:23:13,028
Remember what the Bible says.

1233
01:23:13,129 --> 01:23:16,758
"Repent so that your sins
may be blotted out...

1234
01:23:16,867 --> 01:23:19,097
less Satan take advantage of us.

1235
01:23:19,202 --> 01:23:23,138
For we are not ignorant
of his devices."

1236
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:26,232
You gotta let it go.
The truth has to come.

1237
01:23:26,343 --> 01:23:28,834
You gonna live with that shame
for the rest of your life?

1238
01:23:28,945 --> 01:23:30,310
Come clean.

1239
01:23:30,413 --> 01:23:33,678
Open up your heart.
You can't live with a lie.

1240
01:23:33,783 --> 01:23:36,547
You can't. How are you
gonna fill that hole?

1241
01:23:36,653 --> 01:23:40,180
You can only fill it with the truth,
Dominik. The truth.

1242
01:23:41,291 --> 01:23:43,259
Tell me the truth.

1243
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:45,260
Did you cheat?

1244
01:23:47,063 --> 01:23:51,022
All right. I know you all want to
make your deadlines, so I'll be brief.

1245
01:23:51,134 --> 01:23:54,365
We have cracked
the Steinmetz cheating conspiracy.

1246
01:23:54,471 --> 01:23:56,371
I have in my hand
a signed confession...

1247
01:23:56,473 --> 01:23:58,839
from a Steinmetz team member,
admitting that...

1248
01:23:58,942 --> 01:24:02,708
he did, indeed, receive stolen copies
of the academic decathlon test.

1249
01:24:04,714 --> 01:24:05,942
Says the team was instructed...

1250
01:24:06,049 --> 01:24:07,710
- on how to cheat...
- I won!

1251
01:24:07,817 --> 01:24:10,786
By their former decathlon coach,
Dr. Gerard Plecki.

1252
01:24:10,887 --> 01:24:14,015
Now, while Dr. Plecki did not personally
obtain the stolen tests...

1253
01:24:14,124 --> 01:24:16,649
he made sure that all the students
studied with the test.

1254
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:18,694
He directed the cover-up,
and he attempted to maintain...

1255
01:24:18,795 --> 01:24:21,923
a code of silence
amongst the conspirators.

1256
01:24:22,032 --> 01:24:26,059
As a result, we are considering pursuing
criminal charges against Dr. Plecki.

1257
01:24:26,169 --> 01:24:30,105
Those charges may include conspiracy
to defraud the decathlon competition...

1258
01:24:30,206 --> 01:24:32,401
theft of a scholarship and perjury.

1259
01:24:32,509 --> 01:24:35,808
How did Dr. Plecki get them to cheat?

1260
01:24:35,912 --> 01:24:38,779
These kids are a very tight-knit group.

1261
01:24:38,882 --> 01:24:42,283
Like a cult, if you will. And Dr. Plecki
is the leader of this cult.

1262
01:24:42,385 --> 01:24:45,548
He brainwashed them, made sure they'd
follow him to the gates of hell...

1263
01:24:45,655 --> 01:24:47,623
and then break them down for him.

1264
01:24:47,724 --> 01:24:49,658
And let me just tell you something.

1265
01:24:49,759 --> 01:24:53,286
I've dealt with hard-core rapists,
serial killers, you name it...

1266
01:24:53,396 --> 01:24:56,456
but these kids may be some of the most
skilled liars I've ever encountered.

1267
01:24:56,566 --> 01:25:00,832
They looked me straight in the eye
and lied to me. They scared me.

1268
01:25:00,937 --> 01:25:03,371
Mr. Marconi, is it true...

1269
01:25:03,473 --> 01:25:06,465
one of the team members
is a bisexual witch?

1270
01:25:06,576 --> 01:25:10,034
I can't comment on that aspect
of the investigation.

1271
01:25:10,146 --> 01:25:13,980
Mr. Marconi, there have been allegations
that perhaps there was some sort...

1272
01:25:14,084 --> 01:25:17,645
of sexual relationship going on between
Dr. Plecki and one of his students.

1273
01:25:17,754 --> 01:25:19,984
I can't comment on that aspect
of the investigation.

1274
01:25:20,090 --> 01:25:23,287
Sir, where is Dr. Plecki now?

1275
01:25:23,393 --> 01:25:25,293
His whereabouts are unknown to me
at the moment.

1276
01:25:25,395 --> 01:25:27,420
Will the students be expelled?

1277
01:25:27,530 --> 01:25:30,397
Cheating is a serious infraction...

1278
01:25:30,500 --> 01:25:33,765
in any educational institution...

1279
01:25:33,870 --> 01:25:37,772
and it's something that I
will not tolerate in this system...

1280
01:25:37,874 --> 01:25:40,502
by any teacher or anyone else.

1281
01:25:40,610 --> 01:25:44,637
They should hold that adult responsible
as a teacher. They should fire him.

1282
01:25:44,748 --> 01:25:48,275
What it does is tell me how far
we've come in our society.

1283
01:25:48,385 --> 01:25:51,912
When I was in school,
cheating was a monumental offense.

1284
01:25:52,022 --> 01:25:54,047
Honor was held in high esteem.

1285
01:25:54,157 --> 01:25:56,057
He's a moral midget.

1286
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:59,128
I always had a bad feeling about Jerry.

1287
01:25:59,229 --> 01:26:01,789
I knew something was going on.

1288
01:26:01,898 --> 01:26:04,492
Kids coming and going late at night.

1289
01:26:04,601 --> 01:26:08,469
One time I saw a teenager
leave at 1:00 in the morning.

1290
01:26:08,571 --> 01:26:10,471
A crisis management team
has been called in...

1291
01:26:10,573 --> 01:26:13,167
to counsel shocked students
and team members.

1292
01:26:13,276 --> 01:26:16,268
Steinmetz is a school in pain.

1293
01:26:16,379 --> 01:26:18,472
There he is.
Get that fuckin' snitch!

1294
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:26,387
- Get him!
- Help! Get 'em off me!

1295
01:27:01,357 --> 01:27:04,258
How could you do this?

1296
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:06,885
How could you betray those kids?

1297
01:27:06,996 --> 01:27:08,930
It's not that simple, Mother.

1298
01:27:09,032 --> 01:27:11,500
Yes, it is. It's that simple.

1299
01:27:11,601 --> 01:27:14,195
Teachers don't teach kids
how to cheat.

1300
01:27:14,304 --> 01:27:17,364
Believe me, those kids
didn't need any instruction.

1301
01:27:17,474 --> 01:27:19,942
Yes! Yes, they did.

1302
01:27:20,043 --> 01:27:23,444
They needed someone to tell them
that it was wrong.

1303
01:27:24,547 --> 01:27:28,005
Your father was so proud
when you became a teacher.

1304
01:27:28,118 --> 01:27:30,143
He never cared
how much money you made.

1305
01:27:30,253 --> 01:27:33,711
He just wanted you
to reflect well on us.

1306
01:27:33,823 --> 01:27:36,690
He lived a decent, honest life.

1307
01:27:36,793 --> 01:27:39,387
Yeah, and look what happened to him.
He got screwed.

1308
01:27:39,496 --> 01:27:42,727
He had this bullshit immigrant notion
that if he worked hard enough...

1309
01:27:42,832 --> 01:27:46,233
and wanted something badly enough,
all his dreams would come true!

1310
01:27:48,238 --> 01:27:52,732
All your dreams would come true!
That's why he worked so hard.

1311
01:27:52,842 --> 01:27:56,107
So that you would have the opportunities
that he never got.

1312
01:27:56,212 --> 01:27:58,680
That's why he worked at that factory!

1313
01:27:58,782 --> 01:28:00,977
Inhaling those diesel fumes
so you wouldn't have to!

1314
01:28:01,084 --> 01:28:04,019
The minute he got sick,
they laid him off!

1315
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:07,521
They took his pension,
they took his medical insurance!

1316
01:28:07,624 --> 01:28:10,957
They killed him!
They fucking killed him!

1317
01:28:11,060 --> 01:28:15,190
That was his reward! That was the reward
that he got for all his hard work!

1318
01:28:15,298 --> 01:28:17,664
- Right there!
- Listen.

1319
01:28:18,835 --> 01:28:22,464
No matter what happened
to your father...

1320
01:28:22,572 --> 01:28:26,633
he never used it as an excuse
to do something that was wrong.

1321
01:28:28,044 --> 01:28:30,478
You're not the victim here, Jerry.

1322
01:28:30,580 --> 01:28:33,549
What you did was wrong.

1323
01:28:34,517 --> 01:28:38,476
And nothing you say
can ever make it right.

1324
01:28:53,703 --> 01:28:56,467
Guys, I'm leaving tonight.

1325
01:28:56,573 --> 01:29:00,202
As I'm sure you know,
the only question left unanswered...

1326
01:29:00,310 --> 01:29:03,438
is whether to form a lynching party
or just burn me at the stake.

1327
01:29:03,546 --> 01:29:07,209
So I think it's time
to head for friendlier climes.

1328
01:29:07,317 --> 01:29:10,650
Or at least someplace
where there isn't a bounty on my head.

1329
01:29:10,753 --> 01:29:12,653
Have you considered Somalia?

1330
01:29:14,557 --> 01:29:17,651
Now, obviously,
we made some mistakes.

1331
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:20,024
- Getting caught, for one.
- No, no, no.

1332
01:29:20,129 --> 01:29:23,530
This isn't about getting caught
or being punished.

1333
01:29:23,633 --> 01:29:26,864
I look at what we did as kind of
a civil disobedience.

1334
01:29:27,704 --> 01:29:31,231
Or maybe that was a mistake.
Maybe I owe you an apology.

1335
01:29:32,809 --> 01:29:35,141
I don't know anything anymore.
I just know that sometimes...

1336
01:29:35,245 --> 01:29:38,237
you need to break the rules
in order to change them.

1337
01:29:38,348 --> 01:29:41,146
And things will change because of this.

1338
01:29:41,251 --> 01:29:45,711
- They'll make the tests harder to steal.
- Yeah, probably will.

1339
01:29:45,822 --> 01:29:49,349
But they'll also have to justify
holding a competition that isn't real...

1340
01:29:49,459 --> 01:29:51,825
where the same team wins,
year after year.

1341
01:29:51,928 --> 01:29:54,021
They'll have to justify
warehousing you...

1342
01:29:54,130 --> 01:29:57,293
while a chosen few
get a quality education.

1343
01:29:57,400 --> 01:30:01,200
But I want you all
to put it behind you.

1344
01:30:03,306 --> 01:30:06,764
If anyone asks,
you tell them I got the tests...

1345
01:30:07,677 --> 01:30:09,702
forced you to look at them...

1346
01:30:09,812 --> 01:30:12,110
threatened you if you talked.

1347
01:30:14,284 --> 01:30:16,650
'Cause it doesn't matter to me.
My career is over.

1348
01:30:16,753 --> 01:30:19,051
Yours are just beginning.

1349
01:30:21,190 --> 01:30:22,748
Here.

1350
01:30:22,859 --> 01:30:25,726
We got something for you.

1351
01:30:26,829 --> 01:30:29,730
- A little something.
- Well, that's...

1352
01:30:30,833 --> 01:30:33,267
Thank you very much. That's...

1353
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:49,548
"Dear Dr. Plecki,
the skills you've taught us...

1354
01:30:49,652 --> 01:30:51,677
will serve us
the rest of our lives.

1355
01:30:51,788 --> 01:30:54,256
You were the best teacher
we ever had.

1356
01:30:54,357 --> 01:30:58,623
The '94, '95 Steinmetz
Academic Decathlon Team."

1357
01:31:28,024 --> 01:31:31,152
These were children.
And it incenses me that an adult...

1358
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:34,718
would seduce and corrupt
innocent children in this manner.

1359
01:31:34,831 --> 01:31:38,232
I am just so upset by this.
I cannot even believe...

1360
01:31:38,334 --> 01:31:41,394
Everyone in my school cheats.
It's like brushing your teeth.

1361
01:31:41,504 --> 01:31:46,305
Only the stoners don't cheat, because
they don't even care about their grades.

1362
01:31:46,409 --> 01:31:48,934
But don't you realize
that when you cheat...

1363
01:31:49,045 --> 01:31:51,536
the only one you're hurting
is yourself?

1364
01:31:51,647 --> 01:31:56,380
Yeah, I'm in a lot of pain. I cheated in
high school and got into a good college.

1365
01:31:56,486 --> 01:31:59,011
I cheated in college and got into
a really great law school.

1366
01:31:59,122 --> 01:32:01,989
I cheated in law school
and got into a great law firm.

1367
01:32:02,091 --> 01:32:04,719
Now I'm bagging,
like, 700 grand a year...

1368
01:32:04,827 --> 01:32:08,661
and I never regretted not learning how
to do that calculus derivative stuff.

1369
01:32:08,765 --> 01:32:12,667
I'm just glad I got out of high school
and got an "A" in calculus.

1370
01:32:21,711 --> 01:32:23,611
People always ask me...

1371
01:32:23,713 --> 01:32:25,613
"Having gone through everything
you went through...

1372
01:32:25,715 --> 01:32:27,615
would you do it again?"

1373
01:32:27,717 --> 01:32:29,912
And I always give the same answer.

1374
01:32:30,019 --> 01:32:31,919
"In a heartbeat."

1375
01:32:32,021 --> 01:32:34,251
I learned more about the way
the world really works...

1376
01:32:34,357 --> 01:32:36,257
from my nine months on the decathlon...

1377
01:32:36,359 --> 01:32:39,328
than most people
will learn in a lifetime.

1378
01:32:40,430 --> 01:32:42,591
Eventually the media siege ended...

1379
01:32:42,698 --> 01:32:44,598
and we returned to school.

1380
01:32:44,700 --> 01:32:47,328
We took some grief for ruining
Steinmetz's reputation...

1381
01:32:47,437 --> 01:32:49,701
as if such a thing were possible.

1382
01:32:50,907 --> 01:32:53,467
We had to write an essay on ethics.

1383
01:32:53,576 --> 01:32:55,874
Matt copied his from
the Dalai Lama's autobiography...

1384
01:32:55,978 --> 01:32:58,947
which we all thought
was pretty amusing.

1385
01:32:59,048 --> 01:33:01,608
And then we just drifted apart.

1386
01:33:02,852 --> 01:33:06,219
Most of the kids just wanted to
put the whole thing behind them.

1387
01:33:06,322 --> 01:33:08,347
They think I'm crazy
for talking to you...

1388
01:33:08,458 --> 01:33:10,790
but I've never
buried my head in shame.

1389
01:33:10,893 --> 01:33:13,327
And I'm not very big on apologies.

1390
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:16,530
I spent my senior year half asleep...

1391
01:33:16,632 --> 01:33:20,090
which made it
a whole lot easier to blend in.

1392
01:33:21,737 --> 01:33:25,969
I haven't seen Dr. Plecki
since that day by the lake.

1393
01:33:26,075 --> 01:33:29,374
I heard something about a business
near Wicker Park.

1394
01:33:29,479 --> 01:33:31,379
I thought about trying to find him...

1395
01:33:31,481 --> 01:33:34,041
but I never did.

1396
01:33:35,384 --> 01:33:38,285
I figure we'll meet up again
when the time's right.

1397
01:33:41,390 --> 01:33:43,290
That's right. That's me.

1398
01:33:43,392 --> 01:33:46,054
I got into college...
a good one...

1399
01:33:46,162 --> 01:33:49,461
just like Dr. Plecki promised.

1400
01:33:49,565 --> 01:33:53,934
I think the admissions officer thought
my decathlon experience built character.

1401
01:33:55,037 --> 01:33:56,937
I'm getting good grades...

1402
01:33:57,039 --> 01:33:59,007
and no, I'm not cheating.

1403
01:34:00,109 --> 01:34:02,373
Don't laugh, but...

1404
01:34:02,478 --> 01:34:05,572
I'm thinking about
becoming a teacher.

1405
01:34:05,681 --> 01:34:09,583
There's no more noble job
than shaping young minds.

1406
01:34:10,686 --> 01:34:13,382
So what would I do if I caught
one of my students cheating?

1407
01:34:13,489 --> 01:34:16,322
I'd turn the little bastard in.

1408
01:34:16,425 --> 01:34:18,325
But if they can get by me...

1409
01:34:18,427 --> 01:34:21,225
then I know they'll be ready
for the real world.

1410
01:34:21,330 --> 01:34:23,798
I wouldn't have it any other way.

1411
01:34:33,187 --> 01:34:37,187
