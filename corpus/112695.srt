1
00:03:58,527 --> 00:04:00,518
Claire...

2
00:04:14,327 --> 00:04:16,522
I miss you.

3
00:05:20,527 --> 00:05:24,156
Dr Weir, report to the
Lewis & Clark in Docking Bay four.

4
00:05:41,327 --> 00:05:44,080
- lon drive set.
- Thank you.

5
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:49,920
Heading: vector one-nine degrees.

6
00:05:53,927 --> 00:05:57,476
We are prepped for lockdown.

7
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,722
I can't believe this.
It's ridiculous.

8
00:06:02,767 --> 00:06:07,318
I haven't got more than my hand
in weeks, and now this shit.

9
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,881
Why can't we go to Mars, Captain?

10
00:06:09,927 --> 00:06:12,725
I mean, Mars has... has got women.

11
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:16,077
Smith's right. Neptune...
there's nothing out there.

12
00:06:16,127 --> 00:06:18,595
Yeah, we'll be on our own.

13
00:06:18,647 --> 00:06:23,641
That's the rules.
They drop the ball, we get the call.

14
00:06:23,687 --> 00:06:25,837
Have you got our course plotted?

15
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:27,559
Locked and cocked.

16
00:06:27,607 --> 00:06:29,518
Mr Justin?

17
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:31,762
Everything's green
on my screen, Skipper.

18
00:06:31,807 --> 00:06:36,039
- Start countdown.
- lon drive in 10 minutes.

19
00:06:36,087 --> 00:06:37,964
Thank you, Lieutenant. Let's go.

20
00:06:38,007 --> 00:06:40,601
- Smith, follow me.
- Yes, ma'am.

21
00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:43,365
Justin, prep those tanks.

22
00:06:43,407 --> 00:06:44,806
Yes, sir.

23
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,475
Mr Cooper. lon drive in 10 minutes.

24
00:06:50,527 --> 00:06:53,360
Ooh, time to play "spam-in-the-can".

25
00:06:53,407 --> 00:06:55,921
- Skipper!
- Peters.

26
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:58,925
Captain Miller,
I just wanted to say that...

27
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:01,481
The clock is ticking, Doctor.

28
00:07:01,527 --> 00:07:04,519
Waiting for a personal invitation,
Mr Smith?

29
00:07:04,567 --> 00:07:06,922
- No, sir!
- Captain, I don't...

30
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:10,801
Follow the crew to the grav tanks.
We're almost under way.

31
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,838
Square away that bunk, Mr Cooper,

32
00:07:12,887 --> 00:07:14,605
or you're walking to Neptune.

33
00:07:14,647 --> 00:07:16,399
What's the hold-up, Peters?

34
00:07:16,447 --> 00:07:18,165
Loading the CO2 scrubbers, sir.

35
00:07:18,207 --> 00:07:20,004
You stand right here.

36
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,436
Thanks, DJ.

37
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:25,364
Hats off.

38
00:07:25,407 --> 00:07:28,444
- First time in a grav couch?
- Yeah.

39
00:07:29,887 --> 00:07:33,402
I think your captain has a problem
with me.

40
00:07:33,447 --> 00:07:35,677
Oh, well, don't worry about him.

41
00:07:35,727 --> 00:07:39,117
He just loves having complete
strangers on his ship. DJ!

42
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,566
Yeah!

43
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,885
Nah. Is this necessary?

44
00:07:44,927 --> 00:07:49,717
When the ion drive fires
you'll be taking about 30 Gs.

45
00:07:49,767 --> 00:07:53,919
Without a tank, the force
would liquefy your skeleton.

46
00:07:53,967 --> 00:07:56,435
I've seen the effect on mice.

47
00:08:00,327 --> 00:08:01,476
Claustrophobic?

48
00:08:01,527 --> 00:08:03,119
Very.

49
00:08:27,127 --> 00:08:28,480
Billy.

50
00:09:09,367 --> 00:09:12,200
I'm so alone.

51
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,600
Hello?

52
00:09:25,047 --> 00:09:27,038
Is anyone there?

53
00:10:09,287 --> 00:10:11,278
Billy?

54
00:10:12,527 --> 00:10:14,119
I'm so cold.

55
00:10:23,327 --> 00:10:24,726
Claire.

56
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:28,844
I'm waiting.

57
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,572
You're all right. Breathe. DJ!

58
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,607
OK, Dr Weir.
Let's get you up. Come on.

59
00:10:47,642 --> 00:10:49,012
I'm fine!

60
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:50,932
OK. There you go.

61
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:55,727
Move nice and slow. You've been
in stasis for 56 days.

62
00:10:55,762 --> 00:10:57,567
You're a little disorientated.
Understand?

63
00:10:57,602 --> 00:10:59,764
I'm all right. Thank you.

64
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,927
OK. Take that. Don't rush it.

65
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:03,883
All yours.

66
00:11:06,287 --> 00:11:07,879
You OK, Doc?

67
00:11:09,487 --> 00:11:10,887
Want some coffee?

68
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:12,052
What?

69
00:11:12,087 --> 00:11:15,487
Would you like some coffee?

70
00:11:15,522 --> 00:11:18,372
No. Thank you.

71
00:11:18,407 --> 00:11:21,692
All right. Suit yourself.

72
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,927
What about you, Starck?
Want something hot and black?

73
00:11:24,962 --> 00:11:27,584
- Is that an offer?
- No.

74
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:30,207
Then how about some coffee?

75
00:11:30,242 --> 00:11:32,492
- Starck?
- Yes, sir.

76
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:34,212
Why aren't you on the bridge?

77
00:11:34,247 --> 00:11:39,082
- Mind if I get dressed?
- Yes. Let's go, people!

78
00:11:40,647 --> 00:11:43,327
OK, Denny, here we go.
Happy birthday.

79
00:11:43,362 --> 00:11:45,327
Play horsey, Mommy! Play horsey!

80
00:11:45,362 --> 00:11:46,532
Oh! Oh!

81
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:48,444
Hey! No balls indoors.

82
00:11:51,607 --> 00:11:55,567
- Yo, apologise.
- Sorry, Mama Bear.

83
00:11:55,602 --> 00:11:58,400
- Peters?
- Yes, sir.

84
00:11:58,607 --> 00:11:59,722
I did try to find
a replacement for you,

85
00:12:01,967 --> 00:12:05,292
but it was impossible. I am sorry.

86
00:12:05,327 --> 00:12:09,587
I talked to my ex. He's going
to take Denny for Christmas.

87
00:12:09,622 --> 00:12:13,847
I'll get him for the summer,
so everything's all right.

88
00:12:13,882 --> 00:12:15,732
Smitty!

89
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:17,612
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.

90
00:12:17,647 --> 00:12:19,767
In approximately
2 hours and 23 minutes,

91
00:12:19,802 --> 00:12:22,167
we'll be arriving at Neptune.

92
00:12:22,202 --> 00:12:23,327
I thank you.

93
00:12:23,362 --> 00:12:24,652
Good.

94
00:12:24,687 --> 00:12:26,532
Everything's five by five.

95
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:29,607
- USAC notified of our position?
- Yes, sir.

96
00:12:29,642 --> 00:12:31,452
All right, people, listen up.

97
00:12:31,487 --> 00:12:37,127
We have an addition to our crew.
Dr Weir, care to join us?

98
00:12:37,162 --> 00:12:38,972
Introductions all around.

99
00:12:39,007 --> 00:12:41,247
This is my XO... Lieutenant Starck.

100
00:12:41,282 --> 00:12:42,492
Mr Justin, Engineering.

101
00:12:42,527 --> 00:12:44,527
The funky spaceman is Mr Cooper.

102
00:12:44,562 --> 00:12:46,684
What do you do here, Coop?

103
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,783
Doc. I'm your best friend.

104
00:12:48,818 --> 00:12:50,872
Life-saver and heartbreaker.

105
00:12:50,907 --> 00:12:52,892
He's a rescue technician.

106
00:12:52,927 --> 00:12:55,287
This is Peters, medical technician.

107
00:12:55,322 --> 00:12:56,892
And my pilot... Mr Smith.

108
00:12:56,927 --> 00:13:00,287
The gloomy Gus in the corner
over there, that's, uh...

109
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:02,357
DJ Trauma.

110
00:13:04,047 --> 00:13:08,287
All right. All right.
Now, then, I got a question.

111
00:13:08,322 --> 00:13:10,852
What the fuck are we doing here?

112
00:13:10,887 --> 00:13:14,367
Perhaps the good doctor
will tell us.

113
00:13:14,402 --> 00:13:17,372
Thank you. Uh, I want to say

114
00:13:17,407 --> 00:13:19,947
how much I appreciate
this opportunity...

115
00:13:19,982 --> 00:13:22,487
Yes. You appreciate
being here, Doctor,

116
00:13:22,522 --> 00:13:24,572
but understand - we don't.

117
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:27,987
We were taken off leave
and sent into Neptune space.

118
00:13:28,022 --> 00:13:31,474
We are three billion clicks
from the nearest outpost.

119
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:34,927
The last time USAC attempted
a rescue this far out...

120
00:13:34,962 --> 00:13:37,932
we lost both ships.
So if you please...

121
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:42,047
Right. Well, everything
I'm about to tell you

122
00:13:42,082 --> 00:13:44,944
is considered code black
by the NSA.

123
00:13:44,979 --> 00:13:47,833
USAC intercepted
a radio transmission

124
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,687
from a decaying orbit
around Neptune.

125
00:13:50,722 --> 00:13:52,572
The source of this transmission

126
00:13:52,607 --> 00:13:55,804
has been identified
as the Event Horizon.

127
00:13:57,807 --> 00:14:00,627
Yeah. Well, that's bullshit,
for starters.

128
00:14:00,662 --> 00:14:03,447
I lost leave for this?
Thank you so much!

129
00:14:03,482 --> 00:14:05,165
Smitty, sit down.

130
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:09,047
Cooper, as you were.

131
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:10,812
Just let the man speak.

132
00:14:10,847 --> 00:14:14,087
What was made public
about the Event Horizon...

133
00:14:14,122 --> 00:14:16,252
that she was a research vessel,

134
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:19,927
that her reactor went critical,
and she blew up...

135
00:14:19,962 --> 00:14:21,892
none of that is true.

136
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:25,172
The Event Horizon was
a secret government project

137
00:14:25,207 --> 00:14:28,647
to create a spacecraft capable
of faster-than-light flight.

138
00:14:28,682 --> 00:14:31,567
Uh, excuse me.
You can't actually do that.

139
00:14:31,602 --> 00:14:35,332
The law of relativity prohibits it.

140
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:38,567
Relativity, yes. We can't break
the law of relativity,

141
00:14:38,602 --> 00:14:40,892
but we can go around it.

142
00:14:40,927 --> 00:14:44,027
The ship doesn't really
go faster than light.

143
00:14:44,062 --> 00:14:47,114
It creates a gateway
to jump instantaneously

144
00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:50,167
from one point to another
light years away.

145
00:14:50,202 --> 00:14:51,412
How?

146
00:14:51,447 --> 00:14:54,927
Well, that's difficult to...
it's all math.

147
00:14:54,962 --> 00:14:56,372
Try us, Doctor.

148
00:14:56,407 --> 00:14:59,327
Right. Well, uh,
using layman's terms...

149
00:14:59,362 --> 00:15:01,924
we use a retaining magnetic field

150
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:04,487
to focus a narrow beam of gravitons.

151
00:15:04,522 --> 00:15:08,412
These, in turn, fold space-time

152
00:15:08,447 --> 00:15:10,947
until the space-time curvature
becomes infinitely large

153
00:15:10,982 --> 00:15:13,447
and you produce a singularity.
Now, the singularity...

154
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:15,332
Layman's terms.

155
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:19,121
Well, fuck layman's terms.
Do you speak English?

156
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:24,647
Imagine for a minute
that this piece of paper...

157
00:15:24,682 --> 00:15:28,327
Uh, excuse me.
That's Vanessa, and that's mine.

158
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:30,967
This piece of paper
represents space-time,

159
00:15:31,002 --> 00:15:34,880
and you want to get from "A" here...

160
00:15:35,607 --> 00:15:36,972
to "B" there.

161
00:15:37,007 --> 00:15:40,327
Now, what's the shortest
distance between two points?

162
00:15:40,362 --> 00:15:41,316
A straight line.

163
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:46,527
Wrong. The shortest distance
between two points is zero,

164
00:15:46,562 --> 00:15:48,407
and that's what the gateway does...

165
00:15:48,442 --> 00:15:51,092
it folds... space

166
00:15:51,127 --> 00:15:54,892
so that point "A" and point "B"

167
00:15:54,927 --> 00:15:57,812
coexist in the same
space and time.

168
00:15:57,847 --> 00:16:01,647
When the spacecraft
passes through the gateway,

169
00:16:01,682 --> 00:16:03,964
space returns to normal.

170
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:06,383
It's called a gravity drive.

171
00:16:06,418 --> 00:16:08,767
How do you know all this?

172
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,652
I built it.

173
00:16:10,687 --> 00:16:13,172
Well, I see why they sent you.

174
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:16,927
So if the ship didn't blow up,
then what happened?

175
00:16:16,962 --> 00:16:20,812
Well...
the mission was going perfectly,

176
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:23,447
they reached safe distance
using conventional thrusters,

177
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:27,247
they had the go-ahead
to use the gravity drive

178
00:16:27,282 --> 00:16:29,887
to open the gateway
to Proxima Centauri,

179
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:33,084
and then, they just disappeared,

180
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:36,247
vanished without a trace. Until now.

181
00:16:36,282 --> 00:16:38,332
Where has she been, Doctor?

182
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:41,732
That's what we're here to find out.

183
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,572
We've been unable
to verify life contact.

184
00:16:44,607 --> 00:16:48,998
The TDRS did receive
this single transmission.

185
00:16:59,887 --> 00:17:03,387
- What the fucking hell is that?
- Listen to this.

186
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:07,509
Houston passed the recording
through several filters

187
00:17:07,544 --> 00:17:11,597
and managed to isolate what
appears to be a human voice.

188
00:17:16,727 --> 00:17:20,127
- I'm not sure it is language.
- Latin.

189
00:17:20,162 --> 00:17:22,524
- What?
- I mean, I think...

190
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,852
Well, it sounds like Latin.

191
00:17:24,887 --> 00:17:28,323
- Can you translate it?
- Play it again.

192
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:33,317
Right there. You hear that?

193
00:17:36,447 --> 00:17:39,167
Sounds like "liberate me"
something or other.

194
00:17:39,202 --> 00:17:41,407
I can't make out the rest.

195
00:17:41,442 --> 00:17:43,523
"Liberate me"?

196
00:17:44,687 --> 00:17:46,405
"Save me. "

197
00:17:48,407 --> 00:17:50,204
All right. Stations, people.

198
00:18:03,287 --> 00:18:07,127
Crossing the horizon. Optimum
approach angle is 14 degrees.

199
00:18:07,162 --> 00:18:09,647
Come around to 3-3-4.

200
00:18:09,682 --> 00:18:11,012
3-3-4.

201
00:18:11,047 --> 00:18:13,767
Make your approach
vector negative 14 degrees.

202
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:14,882
1-4 degrees.

203
00:18:18,287 --> 00:18:21,007
Locked on Event Horizon's
navigation beacon.

204
00:18:21,042 --> 00:18:22,932
She's in the upper ionosphere,

205
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:26,596
and it looks like
we're in for some heavy chop!

206
00:18:30,487 --> 00:18:33,372
- Bring us in tight.
- Yes, sir.

207
00:18:33,407 --> 00:18:37,167
- Mr Justin, how's my ship?
- Smooth sailing, sir.

208
00:18:37,202 --> 00:18:40,224
Matching speed on my mark.

209
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:43,246
Three, two, one, mark!

210
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:49,557
- Range?
- 10,000 metres, sir.

211
00:18:51,527 --> 00:18:53,772
Check radio.
See if anybody's listening.

212
00:18:53,807 --> 00:18:57,527
This is the USAC Lewis & Clark
hailing Event Horizon.

213
00:18:57,562 --> 00:18:59,012
Event Horizon, do you read?

214
00:18:59,047 --> 00:19:03,027
Dr Weir!
I think you'll want to see this.

215
00:19:03,062 --> 00:19:06,574
- Where is she?
- Dead ahead, 5,000 metres!

216
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:10,087
- Starck?
- Event Horizon, do you read?

217
00:19:10,122 --> 00:19:11,679
3,000 metres and closing!

218
00:19:16,527 --> 00:19:20,127
- Can't see anything!
- 1,500 metres, sir. Too close.

219
00:19:20,162 --> 00:19:22,932
- Where is it?
- Right in front!

220
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:25,927
- 1,000 metres.
- Proximity warning!

221
00:19:25,962 --> 00:19:28,087
900! 800!

222
00:19:28,122 --> 00:19:29,492
700!

223
00:19:29,527 --> 00:19:32,847
- We're gonna hit!
- Starck!

224
00:19:32,882 --> 00:19:34,166
God!

225
00:19:36,607 --> 00:19:38,563
Reverse thrusters! Full!

226
00:19:50,847 --> 00:19:52,519
There she is.

227
00:20:11,967 --> 00:20:13,812
Jesus.

228
00:20:13,847 --> 00:20:15,807
Very impressive ship, Doctor.

229
00:20:15,842 --> 00:20:17,572
Thank you.

230
00:20:17,607 --> 00:20:20,263
Mr Smith, are you up for a flyby?

231
00:20:20,298 --> 00:20:22,919
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I'd love to.

232
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:39,767
That's the main airlock,
we can dock in there.

233
00:20:39,802 --> 00:20:42,092
All right. Smith, use the arm

234
00:20:42,127 --> 00:20:44,641
and lock us onto
that antenna cluster.

235
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:55,476
Go carefully here. That's not
a load-bearing structure.

236
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,038
It is now, Doctor.

237
00:21:01,247 --> 00:21:03,132
Everything five by five?

238
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:05,087
Locked into the Event Horizon.

239
00:21:05,122 --> 00:21:07,244
Light 'em if you got 'em.

240
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:09,683
Thank you very much, sir.

241
00:21:09,718 --> 00:21:11,682
Starck, give me a read.

242
00:21:11,717 --> 00:21:13,612
The reactor's still hot.

243
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,887
We've got several
small radiation sources,

244
00:21:15,922 --> 00:21:17,767
but they're leaks, nothing serious.

245
00:21:17,802 --> 00:21:19,252
Pressure?

246
00:21:19,287 --> 00:21:21,847
The hull's intact,
but there's no gravity,

247
00:21:21,882 --> 00:21:24,212
and thermal units are off-line.

248
00:21:24,247 --> 00:21:27,847
The crew couldn't survive
unless they were in stasis.

249
00:21:27,882 --> 00:21:31,127
- Find them, Starck.
- Already on it, Captain.

250
00:21:31,162 --> 00:21:32,924
Bio-scan on-line.

251
00:21:34,087 --> 00:21:36,847
There's something wrong
with the scan.

252
00:21:36,882 --> 00:21:39,572
- Radiation interference?
- Not enough.

253
00:21:39,607 --> 00:21:43,847
I'm picking up life forms
but I can't get a lock.

254
00:21:43,882 --> 00:21:45,732
These readings don't make sense.

255
00:21:45,767 --> 00:21:49,407
OK. We do it the hard way...
room by room.

256
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:50,692
Starck, deploy the umbilicus.

257
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:54,087
- Smitty, fire up the War Room.
- Sir.

258
00:21:54,122 --> 00:21:56,727
Mr Justin, you're up for a walk?

259
00:21:56,762 --> 00:21:57,921
Yes, sir.

260
00:22:01,647 --> 00:22:03,932
Doctor, I'll need you here.

261
00:22:03,967 --> 00:22:08,412
Captain... I need to be on that ship.

262
00:22:08,447 --> 00:22:11,287
Once it's secured,
we'll bring you on board...

263
00:22:11,322 --> 00:22:13,447
That's unacceptable. I need to be...

264
00:22:13,482 --> 00:22:16,172
Once we've secured the ship.

265
00:22:16,207 --> 00:22:19,483
I need you to guide us.
Help us do our job.

266
00:22:32,407 --> 00:22:34,402
Oh, oh, honey, honey, honey.

267
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:36,398
You forgot your briefcase.

268
00:22:46,927 --> 00:22:48,280
Stand clear!

269
00:22:49,647 --> 00:22:51,527
Anything gets funky, Cooper...

270
00:22:51,562 --> 00:22:53,518
I'll be on it!

271
00:22:54,567 --> 00:22:56,892
Yo, Baby Bear...

272
00:22:56,927 --> 00:22:58,326
keep your nose clean.

273
00:23:05,447 --> 00:23:07,039
DJ, showtime.

274
00:23:08,807 --> 00:23:11,252
Video feed is clear.

275
00:23:11,287 --> 00:23:13,167
Are you with us, Dr Weir?

276
00:23:13,202 --> 00:23:15,332
Yes, I'm with you.

277
00:23:15,367 --> 00:23:17,252
We are crossing the umbilicus,

278
00:23:17,287 --> 00:23:20,085
making our approach
to the Event Horizon.

279
00:23:21,607 --> 00:23:23,723
You're at the outer airlock door.

280
00:23:26,327 --> 00:23:27,806
Magnetic boots on.

281
00:23:32,767 --> 00:23:35,076
We've got pressure.

282
00:23:52,967 --> 00:23:55,435
Place is a deep-freeze.

283
00:23:57,327 --> 00:23:59,636
We got ice crystals everywhere.

284
00:24:01,247 --> 00:24:03,612
That's the central corridor
that you're in.

285
00:24:03,647 --> 00:24:07,765
It connects the front of the
ship to Engineering at the rear.

286
00:24:08,807 --> 00:24:10,767
Mr Justin, take Engineering.

287
00:24:10,802 --> 00:24:12,092
Yes, sir.

288
00:24:12,127 --> 00:24:15,119
Peters and I
will take the forward decks.

289
00:24:23,647 --> 00:24:26,892
Doctor, what are these?

290
00:24:26,927 --> 00:24:30,772
Yeah. I've got another one over here.

291
00:24:30,807 --> 00:24:33,807
In an emergency, they destroy
the central corridor

292
00:24:33,842 --> 00:24:35,932
and split the ship in half,

293
00:24:35,967 --> 00:24:39,880
and then the crew can use
the foredecks as a lifeboat.

294
00:24:44,327 --> 00:24:46,627
I'm in Medical.

295
00:24:46,662 --> 00:24:48,927
No casualties.

296
00:24:52,207 --> 00:24:54,287
Place looks like
it's never been used.

297
00:24:54,322 --> 00:24:56,452
You haven't seen any crew?

298
00:24:56,487 --> 00:24:59,807
If we saw any crew,
Doctor, you'd know it.

299
00:24:59,842 --> 00:25:02,037
Scanning for life readings.

300
00:25:05,247 --> 00:25:07,363
This place is a tomb.

301
00:25:10,007 --> 00:25:11,612
Oh, fuck me!

302
00:25:11,647 --> 00:25:14,532
Miller. Miller, are you OK?

303
00:25:14,567 --> 00:25:17,647
Skipper's got a case of the willies.

304
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,812
Cooper, back to your post.

305
00:25:19,847 --> 00:25:22,087
Miller, your heart rate
just rocketed.

306
00:25:22,122 --> 00:25:23,486
I'm fine.

307
00:25:28,207 --> 00:25:30,772
I think I've reached the door

308
00:25:30,807 --> 00:25:32,972
to the first containment, Dr Weir.

309
00:25:33,007 --> 00:25:35,807
The engineering decks
are on the other side.

310
00:25:35,842 --> 00:25:37,798
OK. Let's take a look.

311
00:25:53,407 --> 00:25:56,487
What the hell is this place, Dr Weir?

312
00:25:56,522 --> 00:25:59,532
It's to enter the second containment

313
00:25:59,567 --> 00:26:01,478
without compromising
the magnetic fields.

314
00:26:02,807 --> 00:26:05,401
Looks like a meat grinder to me.

315
00:26:09,327 --> 00:26:11,318
I'm on the bridge.

316
00:26:17,807 --> 00:26:19,923
Got some blood here.

317
00:26:32,727 --> 00:26:36,127
There must have been a coolant leak.

318
00:26:36,162 --> 00:26:38,322
Man, this shit is everywhere.

319
00:26:39,247 --> 00:26:40,732
Coolant levels on reserve

320
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:43,884
but well within the safety line.

321
00:26:54,767 --> 00:26:57,281
Ms Peters, could you
turn back and left?

322
00:26:58,727 --> 00:27:02,356
- What is it?
- Ship's log.

323
00:27:20,167 --> 00:27:22,078
It's stuck.

324
00:27:23,607 --> 00:27:26,644
It's pretty jammed in there.

325
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:37,007
What the hell happened to his eyes?

326
00:27:37,042 --> 00:27:38,452
Explosive decompression.

327
00:27:38,487 --> 00:27:40,796
Decompression doesn't do that.

328
00:27:41,847 --> 00:27:43,927
Looks like it was caused by...

329
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:45,932
I don't know, an animal.

330
00:27:45,967 --> 00:27:49,207
Look at the soft tissue,
the massive abrasions.

331
00:27:49,242 --> 00:27:51,357
Corpse-cicle.

332
00:27:53,767 --> 00:27:56,201
I'm scanning for life forms.

333
00:28:01,007 --> 00:28:04,795
Man, I'm getting some really
strange readings in here.

334
00:28:15,407 --> 00:28:18,604
Let me see if I can get
some power up.

335
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:31,162
That's the core, the gravity drive...

336
00:28:36,847 --> 00:28:39,042
The heart of the ship.

337
00:28:54,087 --> 00:28:57,079
Justin? Justin, you're breaking up!

338
00:29:07,567 --> 00:29:09,603
Justin, come in!

339
00:29:20,047 --> 00:29:23,403
- What's up?
- The life scan lit up.

340
00:29:34,207 --> 00:29:36,163
Something's wrong. Pull him out.

341
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:43,036
Oh, shit!

342
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:48,532
He's in trouble!

343
00:29:48,567 --> 00:29:50,956
- Go, Coop!
- I'm gone!

344
00:30:28,047 --> 00:30:30,292
Boarding party, sound off.

345
00:30:30,327 --> 00:30:33,399
This is Miller. Can anybody hear me?

346
00:30:39,167 --> 00:30:40,932
What the fuck was that?

347
00:30:40,967 --> 00:30:44,047
Pressure emergency!
We've lost the starboard baffle!

348
00:30:44,082 --> 00:30:45,492
The hull's been breached!

349
00:30:45,527 --> 00:30:49,207
I'll contain it
as long as I can! Get out!

350
00:30:49,242 --> 00:30:52,012
We're losing atmosphere!

351
00:30:52,047 --> 00:30:55,207
There are pressure suits
in the airlock. Go!

352
00:30:55,242 --> 00:30:57,801
Here I come!

353
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:03,212
Hold on, Baby Bear!

354
00:31:03,247 --> 00:31:05,203
I'm almost there, almost there!

355
00:31:09,727 --> 00:31:12,147
I got you! I got you!

356
00:31:12,182 --> 00:31:14,532
Oh! Watch out! Watch!

357
00:31:14,567 --> 00:31:18,887
I got you. What the fuck is this?

358
00:31:18,922 --> 00:31:20,479
Hold on!

359
00:31:22,727 --> 00:31:25,487
Captain Miller! Do you copy? Over!

360
00:31:25,522 --> 00:31:27,572
Smitty, where you been?

361
00:31:27,607 --> 00:31:31,647
We have a situation, sir!
We've lost the starboard baffle,

362
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:33,664
and the hull's been breached!

363
00:31:33,699 --> 00:31:35,647
The safety circuits have failed!

364
00:31:35,682 --> 00:31:37,412
Time for a weld?

365
00:31:37,447 --> 00:31:40,247
No, sir! We've got 218 litres of gas,

366
00:31:40,282 --> 00:31:41,972
and then we've got nothing!

367
00:31:42,007 --> 00:31:45,407
The oxygen tanks failed.
Sir, we are fucking dead!

368
00:31:45,442 --> 00:31:47,127
What about the Event Horizon?

369
00:31:47,162 --> 00:31:48,292
What?

370
00:31:48,327 --> 00:31:50,087
She's got air and power!

371
00:31:50,122 --> 00:31:51,812
It's our only chance!

372
00:31:51,847 --> 00:31:55,167
There's no way
I'm getting on that bastard!

373
00:31:55,202 --> 00:31:57,212
It beats dying, Mr Smith.

374
00:31:57,247 --> 00:32:01,127
I want all personnel on board
the Event Horizon pronto.

375
00:32:01,162 --> 00:32:05,447
- Meet at the air tanks.
- I'm ahead of you, sir.

376
00:32:05,482 --> 00:32:07,247
Bringing thermal units on-line.

377
00:32:07,282 --> 00:32:09,983
Hold tight. Prep for Gs.

378
00:32:10,018 --> 00:32:12,684
Gravity in five seconds.

379
00:32:26,567 --> 00:32:27,892
Wake up!

380
00:32:27,927 --> 00:32:30,236
Open your eyes, all right?

381
00:32:52,567 --> 00:32:53,966
Dr Weir.

382
00:32:55,487 --> 00:33:00,087
Well, I brought
most primary systems on-line...

383
00:33:00,122 --> 00:33:01,212
for now.

384
00:33:01,247 --> 00:33:03,627
Thank you. Starck, what's our status?

385
00:33:03,662 --> 00:33:05,972
The antenna array is completely
fried.

386
00:33:06,007 --> 00:33:09,127
We've got no radio,
no laser, no high gain.

387
00:33:09,162 --> 00:33:10,932
No one's coming to help.

388
00:33:10,967 --> 00:33:14,527
- This air tastes bad.
- Yeah. Carbon dioxide.

389
00:33:14,562 --> 00:33:17,452
And the CO2 filters here are shot.

390
00:33:17,487 --> 00:33:20,087
Take the Clark's.
That gives us... what?

391
00:33:20,122 --> 00:33:22,521
Enough breathable air for 20 hours,

392
00:33:22,556 --> 00:33:24,921
but after that, we'd better be going.

393
00:33:39,047 --> 00:33:41,812
I'm on the port side,

394
00:33:41,847 --> 00:33:43,838
approaching the dorsal heat sink.

395
00:33:47,647 --> 00:33:49,126
Holy shit.

396
00:33:56,007 --> 00:33:57,967
Captain Miller, do you copy?

397
00:33:58,002 --> 00:33:59,452
Smith. How's my ship?

398
00:33:59,487 --> 00:34:02,012
Sir, we've got
a seven-metre fracture.

399
00:34:02,047 --> 00:34:06,487
We can repair her,
but it'll take a long time.

400
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:08,367
Negative. 20 hours, we suffocate.

401
00:34:08,402 --> 00:34:09,846
Understood, sir.

402
00:34:12,207 --> 00:34:14,482
What happened here, Doctor?

403
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:27,532
OK. How is he?

404
00:34:27,567 --> 00:34:29,612
His vital signs seem stable,

405
00:34:29,647 --> 00:34:32,767
but he's unresponsive to stimuli.

406
00:34:32,802 --> 00:34:35,235
I don't know.

407
00:34:37,407 --> 00:34:40,080
He might wake up in 15 minutes.

408
00:34:41,167 --> 00:34:43,347
He might not wake up ever.

409
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:45,492
Skipper, this sounds weird,

410
00:34:45,527 --> 00:34:48,287
but, I mean,
there was, like, nothing,

411
00:34:48,322 --> 00:34:50,664
and then Justin appeared,

412
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:52,972
and, um, there was liquid,

413
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,247
and the whole core just turned solid.

414
00:34:55,282 --> 00:34:57,452
It's just not physically possible.

415
00:34:57,487 --> 00:35:00,167
Doctor, please, don't start
in with that physics shit.

416
00:35:00,202 --> 00:35:02,372
I'm telling you, I saw it.

417
00:35:02,407 --> 00:35:04,407
It would mean the gateway was open.

418
00:35:04,442 --> 00:35:06,412
Then the gateway was open.

419
00:35:06,447 --> 00:35:09,847
It couldn't be because the
gravity drive wasn't activated.

420
00:35:09,882 --> 00:35:11,924
I'm telling you what I saw...

421
00:35:11,959 --> 00:35:13,932
It can't start by itself!

422
00:35:13,967 --> 00:35:16,847
Mr Cooper, you are out of line!

423
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:18,812
Doctor, Mr Justin may die.

424
00:35:18,847 --> 00:35:23,047
Now, whatever happened to him
could happen to all of us.

425
00:35:23,082 --> 00:35:25,967
Mr Cooper says he saw something.

426
00:35:26,002 --> 00:35:28,927
I believe he saw something.

427
00:35:28,962 --> 00:35:31,157
I need an explanation.

428
00:35:34,127 --> 00:35:39,127
Well, in my view, Mr Cooper's
delusional...

429
00:35:39,162 --> 00:35:41,744
but maybe he saw an optical effect

430
00:35:41,779 --> 00:35:44,292
caused by gravitational distortion.

431
00:35:44,327 --> 00:35:46,716
An optical effect!
That's fucking poetic.

432
00:35:48,167 --> 00:35:50,965
I'm sorry. I'm all right. OK.

433
00:35:52,207 --> 00:35:53,727
Gravitational distortion...

434
00:35:53,762 --> 00:35:55,212
what could create that, Doctor?

435
00:35:55,247 --> 00:36:00,607
If, somehow, a burst of gravity
waves escaped from the core,

436
00:36:00,642 --> 00:36:02,452
it could distort space-time.

437
00:36:02,487 --> 00:36:05,212
It could make Justin
seem to disappear.

438
00:36:05,247 --> 00:36:08,207
It could also have damaged
the Lewis & Clark.

439
00:36:08,242 --> 00:36:11,167
However, I think this
is entirely unlikely.

440
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:13,327
What's in the core, Doctor?

441
00:36:13,362 --> 00:36:14,612
It's complicated.

442
00:36:14,647 --> 00:36:17,367
Well, how much time do you need?
We have...

443
00:36:17,402 --> 00:36:20,967
17 hours and 48 minutes.

444
00:36:21,002 --> 00:36:23,322
What's in the core?

445
00:36:24,967 --> 00:36:27,412
This is the gateway.

446
00:36:27,447 --> 00:36:29,767
Now, these three magnetic rings,
when they align,

447
00:36:29,802 --> 00:36:32,212
it creates an artificial black hole,

448
00:36:32,247 --> 00:36:35,647
which allows the ship
to travel to any point in space.

449
00:36:35,682 --> 00:36:37,132
A black hole,

450
00:36:37,167 --> 00:36:39,927
the most destructive force
in the universe...

451
00:36:39,962 --> 00:36:41,647
and you've created one?

452
00:36:41,682 --> 00:36:43,212
Absolutely. Yes.

453
00:36:43,247 --> 00:36:47,047
Because we can use that immense
power to bend space-time.

454
00:36:47,082 --> 00:36:49,452
Look, it would take the Lewis & Clark

455
00:36:49,487 --> 00:36:52,107
a thousand years
to reach our nearest star,

456
00:36:52,142 --> 00:36:55,328
but the Event Horizon
could be there in a day.

457
00:36:55,363 --> 00:36:58,515
- If it worked.
- Come down. It's quite safe.

458
00:37:03,567 --> 00:37:06,532
So if Justin was sucked through,

459
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:09,327
he's been wherever
the Event Horizon's been.

460
00:37:09,362 --> 00:37:12,167
Theoretically, yes, but I told you,

461
00:37:12,202 --> 00:37:14,372
the gateway can't just open.

462
00:37:14,407 --> 00:37:16,647
I see. I want this room sealed off.

463
00:37:16,682 --> 00:37:18,887
Second containment is off limits.

464
00:37:18,922 --> 00:37:20,172
Yes, sir.

465
00:37:20,207 --> 00:37:22,052
Captain, there's no danger.

466
00:37:22,087 --> 00:37:24,927
The gateway's contained.
It's perfectly safe.

467
00:37:24,962 --> 00:37:25,892
Safe?!

468
00:37:25,927 --> 00:37:27,932
Doctor, my ship is in pieces,

469
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:30,567
and one of my crewmen almost died.

470
00:37:30,602 --> 00:37:32,797
No one else goes near this.

471
00:37:51,847 --> 00:37:54,122
Come on.

472
00:37:55,727 --> 00:37:59,887
There's got to be something
on this log.

473
00:37:59,922 --> 00:38:01,764
You can do this.

474
00:38:24,847 --> 00:38:26,761
DJ, where are you?

475
00:38:26,796 --> 00:38:28,676
I'm up on Deck 4.

476
00:39:20,087 --> 00:39:21,600
Mommy.

477
00:39:40,927 --> 00:39:43,600
What is it? You all right?

478
00:39:59,967 --> 00:40:03,147
What's up? You was out there so long.

479
00:40:03,182 --> 00:40:05,894
I'd rather spend 12 hours outside

480
00:40:05,929 --> 00:40:08,572
than another five seconds in here.

481
00:40:08,607 --> 00:40:11,767
It's the final entry
in the ship's log.

482
00:40:11,802 --> 00:40:14,252
I'm very proud of my crew.

483
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:16,927
I'd like to name my station heads:

484
00:40:16,962 --> 00:40:19,567
Chris Chambers, Janice Reuben,

485
00:40:19,602 --> 00:40:22,684
Ben Fender, Dick Smith.

486
00:40:23,847 --> 00:40:26,172
We've reached safe distance...

487
00:40:26,207 --> 00:40:28,412
That's John Kilpack, ship's captain.

488
00:40:28,447 --> 00:40:31,047
.. we're preparing
to engage the gravity drive

489
00:40:31,082 --> 00:40:33,847
and open the gateway
to Proxima Centauri.

490
00:40:33,882 --> 00:40:36,422
"Ave atque vale. "

491
00:40:36,457 --> 00:40:38,962
Hail and farewell.

492
00:40:44,607 --> 00:40:46,692
What is that?

493
00:40:46,727 --> 00:40:50,083
I'll see if I can clean it up.

494
00:40:53,927 --> 00:40:55,447
It's a power drain.

495
00:40:55,482 --> 00:40:57,332
It's the core.

496
00:40:57,367 --> 00:41:01,167
Stay here. I don't want
anybody else near that thing.

497
00:41:01,202 --> 00:41:02,759
Wait for me, Doctor!

498
00:41:03,887 --> 00:41:05,607
What's causing the drain?

499
00:41:05,642 --> 00:41:07,292
Magnetic fields are holding.

500
00:41:07,327 --> 00:41:11,207
There may be a short
in the fail-safe circuit.

501
00:41:11,242 --> 00:41:13,402
Can you give us a hand?

502
00:41:32,647 --> 00:41:35,923
Justin! Justin, can you hear me?

503
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:39,840
- He's coming!
- Who's coming?

504
00:41:41,047 --> 00:41:43,766
The dark.

505
00:41:59,087 --> 00:42:01,396
Yeah. That's the one.

506
00:42:55,687 --> 00:42:59,885
Captain Miller,
I've got some problems here!

507
00:43:03,967 --> 00:43:06,607
Be with me...

508
00:43:06,642 --> 00:43:08,325
forever.

509
00:43:41,847 --> 00:43:44,127
Carbon dioxide
can produce hallucinations,

510
00:43:44,162 --> 00:43:45,292
impair judgement.

511
00:43:45,327 --> 00:43:48,967
Goddamit, it was not a hallucination.

512
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:51,199
Doctor, you were in the duct.

513
00:43:51,234 --> 00:43:53,397
You must have heard something.

514
00:43:54,447 --> 00:43:56,487
You must have seen something.

515
00:43:56,522 --> 00:43:57,852
I did.

516
00:43:57,887 --> 00:44:03,087
About an hour ago, I saw my son
lying on the examination table.

517
00:44:03,122 --> 00:44:05,252
and...

518
00:44:05,287 --> 00:44:07,372
in his legs were crawling...

519
00:44:07,407 --> 00:44:11,727
Ms Peters, it sounds a little like
shock.

520
00:44:11,762 --> 00:44:13,464
You're traumatised...

521
00:44:13,499 --> 00:44:15,132
No. No. Excuse me! No!

522
00:44:15,167 --> 00:44:18,367
I've seen bodies before.
This was different.

523
00:44:18,402 --> 00:44:20,452
She's right.

524
00:44:20,487 --> 00:44:22,247
This... this was real.

525
00:44:22,282 --> 00:44:23,972
I felt... I felt heat.

526
00:44:24,007 --> 00:44:26,601
This is not something
that's in our heads.

527
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:30,307
Smitty, have you seen

528
00:44:30,342 --> 00:44:32,174
anything unusual at all?

529
00:44:32,209 --> 00:44:33,972
No, I haven't seen anything,

530
00:44:34,007 --> 00:44:37,367
and I don't need to see
anything, sir,

531
00:44:37,402 --> 00:44:39,304
but this ship is fucked.

532
00:44:39,339 --> 00:44:41,207
Well, thank you, Mr Smith.

533
00:44:41,242 --> 00:44:42,732
Yeah, you don't...

534
00:44:42,767 --> 00:44:45,172
OK, OK! All right, Doc.

535
00:44:45,207 --> 00:44:47,704
Breaking the laws of physics costs!

536
00:44:47,739 --> 00:44:50,201
You killed the last crew, now us!

537
00:44:50,247 --> 00:44:53,052
It's just a fucking ship.

538
00:44:53,087 --> 00:44:56,167
It's just a ship, a hunk of metal.

539
00:44:56,202 --> 00:44:58,044
There's nothing odd going on.

540
00:45:01,927 --> 00:45:03,246
Fine.

541
00:45:06,087 --> 00:45:07,687
OK. Let's see this.

542
00:45:07,722 --> 00:45:08,972
You all right?

543
00:45:09,007 --> 00:45:11,567
Yeah. I'm just... I'm sorry.

544
00:45:14,407 --> 00:45:16,252
There's no fucking chance...

545
00:45:16,287 --> 00:45:21,087
That's enough! I want you cool! Now!

546
00:45:21,122 --> 00:45:22,412
All right.

547
00:45:22,447 --> 00:45:25,607
You're going outside
on the Clark with Cooper

548
00:45:25,642 --> 00:45:28,767
and you're going to repair
the ship. No mistakes.

549
00:45:28,802 --> 00:45:30,567
Mistakes, nobody goes home.
Understood?

550
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:34,527
Yes, sir. All right.

551
00:45:34,562 --> 00:45:36,119
Get moving.

552
00:45:42,207 --> 00:45:43,372
Miller.

553
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:44,852
What, Starck?

554
00:45:44,887 --> 00:45:46,772
I ran the bio-scan.

555
00:45:46,807 --> 00:45:48,527
The results were bioreadings...

556
00:45:48,562 --> 00:45:50,212
Of an indeterminate origin. Yes.

557
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:53,047
Tell me something useful, Lieutenant.

558
00:45:53,082 --> 00:45:55,847
- I've got a theory.
- Let's hear it.

559
00:45:55,882 --> 00:45:57,412
There's a connection

560
00:45:57,447 --> 00:45:59,612
between the readings
and the hallucinations,

561
00:45:59,647 --> 00:46:02,927
like part of a defensive
reaction, an immune system.

562
00:46:02,962 --> 00:46:04,644
I don't have time...

563
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:06,103
- Listen.
- To what?

564
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,492
This ship is reacting,

565
00:46:07,527 --> 00:46:09,572
and the reactions
are getting stronger.

566
00:46:09,607 --> 00:46:12,747
As if the ship brought back
something with it.

567
00:46:12,782 --> 00:46:15,887
What are you telling me?
That this ship is alive?

568
00:46:15,922 --> 00:46:18,252
You wanted an answer.

569
00:46:18,287 --> 00:46:21,359
I want to survive the next 10 hours.

570
00:48:01,647 --> 00:48:04,092
Did you hear that?!

571
00:48:04,127 --> 00:48:07,047
You heard it. What is it?

572
00:48:07,082 --> 00:48:08,132
Listen to me.

573
00:48:08,167 --> 00:48:09,692
It's DJ, all right?

574
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:11,492
Neither of us heard anything.

575
00:48:11,527 --> 00:48:14,087
Just calm down. Get your breath back.

576
00:48:15,087 --> 00:48:17,521
- Now, tell me.
- I was...

577
00:48:21,327 --> 00:48:22,965
Make it stop!

578
00:48:24,407 --> 00:48:27,007
Open the door.

579
00:48:27,042 --> 00:48:28,679
No!

580
00:48:31,807 --> 00:48:33,607
Weir, stop!

581
00:48:33,642 --> 00:48:35,372
Stop him!

582
00:48:35,407 --> 00:48:37,762
What are you doing?!

583
00:48:39,807 --> 00:48:43,436
In our current environment,
self-control is an asset.

584
00:48:49,607 --> 00:48:51,092
What is it?

585
00:48:51,127 --> 00:48:53,972
Um... the forward airlock.

586
00:48:54,007 --> 00:48:56,647
Miller, Smith, Cooper,
anyone in the airlock?

587
00:48:56,682 --> 00:48:58,797
That's a negative, Starck.

588
00:49:06,887 --> 00:49:09,481
Justin, no! Justin, open the door!

589
00:49:10,567 --> 00:49:11,932
Miller, come in.

590
00:49:11,967 --> 00:49:14,767
Miller, come in.
We have an emergency.

591
00:49:14,802 --> 00:49:16,484
What's going on, Starck?

592
00:49:16,519 --> 00:49:18,167
Justin's in the airlock.

593
00:49:18,202 --> 00:49:19,412
Say again.

594
00:49:19,447 --> 00:49:22,007
Justin's in the airlock
without a suit.

595
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,332
- I'm on it.
- No, sailor.

596
00:49:24,367 --> 00:49:26,972
- Skipper, you need me.
- Stay there.

597
00:49:27,007 --> 00:49:29,887
- He's engaged the override.
- Shut it down.

598
00:49:29,922 --> 00:49:32,567
- I'll try.
- Coming to him, Starck.

599
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:35,479
Justin! Open this door now!

600
00:49:37,527 --> 00:49:39,452
Starck, give me status.

601
00:49:39,487 --> 00:49:42,807
He's engaged the override.
We can't open the door.

602
00:49:42,842 --> 00:49:46,766
- I'll get the kit.
- Justin, open the door!

603
00:49:51,327 --> 00:49:54,207
Justin, open the door.

604
00:49:54,242 --> 00:49:55,692
Did you hear it?

605
00:49:55,727 --> 00:50:00,367
- Keep him talking.
- Yes, I heard it. What is it?

606
00:50:00,402 --> 00:50:03,687
It shows you things...
horrible things.

607
00:50:03,722 --> 00:50:05,252
What does?

608
00:50:05,287 --> 00:50:08,772
The dark inside me...
from the other place.

609
00:50:08,807 --> 00:50:13,287
- I won't go back there.
- Baby Bear, open the door!

610
00:50:13,322 --> 00:50:15,612
- What's happening?
- He won't listen.

611
00:50:15,647 --> 00:50:19,247
If he opens the airlock
he'll turn inside out.

612
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:22,084
- Stay with me!
- Almost got it...

613
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:24,852
Stay with me, Justin! Open that door!

614
00:50:24,887 --> 00:50:28,407
If you could see what I've seen,
you wouldn't stop me.

615
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:29,924
That's not you talking!

616
00:50:29,959 --> 00:50:31,372
That's not you talking.

617
00:50:31,407 --> 00:50:35,116
That's it, there. Open the door.
Go for that button.

618
00:50:42,127 --> 00:50:45,437
He's activated the door.
It's on a 30-second delay.

619
00:50:50,487 --> 00:50:55,487
Stand by for decompression
in 25 seconds.

620
00:50:55,522 --> 00:50:57,332
Where am I? Hey...

621
00:50:57,367 --> 00:50:59,687
- Open it!
- Open the door...

622
00:50:59,722 --> 00:51:01,012
I can't.

623
00:51:01,047 --> 00:51:04,007
It won't open when
the outside door's triggered.

624
00:51:04,042 --> 00:51:07,607
- Oh, God.
- Mama Bear... open the door.

625
00:51:07,642 --> 00:51:09,812
Come on. Please...

626
00:51:09,847 --> 00:51:12,292
- Captain!
- Patch me through.

627
00:51:12,327 --> 00:51:16,227
- Tell them to open it.
- I can't, Justin.

628
00:51:16,262 --> 00:51:20,127
- I don't want to die.
- You're not gonna die.

629
00:51:20,162 --> 00:51:22,436
Listen, I'll get you out.

630
00:51:25,727 --> 00:51:27,212
Oh, my God.

631
00:51:27,247 --> 00:51:29,652
It's starting. My eyes!

632
00:51:29,687 --> 00:51:34,047
Don't think about them.
Shut them as tight as you can.

633
00:51:34,082 --> 00:51:35,372
Five seconds.

634
00:51:35,407 --> 00:51:38,647
Tuck yourself into a ball.

635
00:51:38,682 --> 00:51:39,984
I can't breathe!

636
00:51:40,019 --> 00:51:41,252
Oh! Oh, God!

637
00:51:41,287 --> 00:51:43,892
Oh, God, it hurts!

638
00:51:43,927 --> 00:51:48,167
I want you to huff and puff
and empty your lungs.

639
00:51:48,202 --> 00:51:50,044
Do you hear me, Justin?!

640
00:51:52,647 --> 00:51:54,239
Do it! Now!

641
00:52:05,487 --> 00:52:07,478
OK, Baby Bear.

642
00:52:08,647 --> 00:52:10,927
Got him. I got him.

643
00:52:10,962 --> 00:52:13,207
Stand by, people.

644
00:52:13,242 --> 00:52:14,640
Stand by!

645
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:17,647
We've got pressure.

646
00:52:17,682 --> 00:52:19,287
We're coming, Justin!

647
00:52:19,322 --> 00:52:20,572
We're coming!

648
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:23,447
We're going to need five units here.

649
00:52:23,482 --> 00:52:25,039
Hold his head still.

650
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:30,692
Give me some more glycerine now!

651
00:52:30,727 --> 00:52:34,606
- One thing at a time.
- Christ, he's bleeding!

652
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:47,435
I stopped the bleeding.
Stabilised him best I can.

653
00:52:49,007 --> 00:52:53,207
He won't be pretty, but he
should live... if we get back.

654
00:52:53,242 --> 00:52:55,652
We'll make it.

655
00:52:55,687 --> 00:52:57,572
Starck, what's our time like?

656
00:52:57,607 --> 00:53:00,787
CO2 levels will become
toxic in four hours.

657
00:53:00,822 --> 00:53:03,932
All right. Peters,
we've got to find out

658
00:53:03,967 --> 00:53:08,227
what happened to the other crew
before it happens to us.

659
00:53:08,262 --> 00:53:12,487
I can work on the bridge,
but I won't go back to Medical.

660
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:16,212
- Fine.
- Yes, sir.

661
00:53:16,247 --> 00:53:20,647
Justin said something about...

662
00:53:20,682 --> 00:53:23,527
"the dark inside me. "

663
00:53:23,562 --> 00:53:25,047
What's that mean?

664
00:53:25,082 --> 00:53:26,958
Doctor?

665
00:53:29,287 --> 00:53:31,801
I- I don't think it means anything.

666
00:53:35,607 --> 00:53:38,599
Don't you walk away from me, mister.

667
00:53:39,847 --> 00:53:41,692
I'd like some answers, Doctor.

668
00:53:41,727 --> 00:53:45,087
Why did one of my
men try to commit suicide?

669
00:53:45,122 --> 00:53:48,447
I'd like to know
what caused that noise.

670
00:53:48,482 --> 00:53:50,332
Look, thermal changes in the hull

671
00:53:50,367 --> 00:53:53,647
could have caused it
to expand and contract,

672
00:53:53,682 --> 00:53:55,167
causing reverberations.
It's possible.

673
00:53:55,202 --> 00:53:56,892
Bullshit! You built this ship.

674
00:53:56,927 --> 00:53:59,007
You've given me nothing
but bullshit.

675
00:53:59,042 --> 00:54:01,252
What do you to hear?

676
00:54:01,287 --> 00:54:04,207
You said the ship's drive
creates a gateway.

677
00:54:04,242 --> 00:54:05,644
Yeah.

678
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:07,012
To what?

679
00:54:07,047 --> 00:54:08,572
I don't know.

680
00:54:08,607 --> 00:54:10,927
Where did you send it?

681
00:54:10,962 --> 00:54:12,412
I don't know.

682
00:54:12,447 --> 00:54:14,812
Where has it been for seven years?

683
00:54:14,847 --> 00:54:18,172
- I don't know.
- That's not good enough.

684
00:54:18,207 --> 00:54:22,407
You're the expert.
I need answers. That's your job.

685
00:54:22,442 --> 00:54:24,927
Now, the other place, where is that?

686
00:54:24,962 --> 00:54:26,812
I don't know! I don't know!

687
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:30,767
Look, there's a lot of things
happening around here

688
00:54:30,802 --> 00:54:32,607
that I don't fully understand.

689
00:54:32,642 --> 00:54:34,006
I need time.

690
00:54:35,447 --> 00:54:36,852
I see.

691
00:54:36,887 --> 00:54:39,924
Well, that's exactly
what we don't have, Doctor.

692
00:54:44,487 --> 00:54:46,398
Captain!

693
00:54:51,767 --> 00:54:53,962
Don't leave me!

694
00:54:59,447 --> 00:55:02,439
Don't leave me!

695
00:55:06,527 --> 00:55:08,438
Please!

696
00:55:11,047 --> 00:55:15,165
For God's sakes, help me!

697
00:55:24,407 --> 00:55:25,726
It's in your head.

698
00:55:28,567 --> 00:55:30,603
It's just in your head.

699
00:55:49,287 --> 00:55:51,243
God help us.

700
00:55:56,367 --> 00:55:59,252
I'm telling you,
it was his voice I heard.

701
00:55:59,287 --> 00:56:02,279
He was calling to me... a young
bosun named Eddie Corrick.

702
00:56:04,087 --> 00:56:06,476
We served on the Goliath together.

703
00:56:07,887 --> 00:56:09,812
When the O2 tanks ruptured,

704
00:56:09,847 --> 00:56:12,692
four of us made it to the lifeboat,

705
00:56:12,727 --> 00:56:16,407
but Corrick was still on board
when the fire broke out.

706
00:56:16,442 --> 00:56:19,604
You ever seen fire in zero gravity?

707
00:56:21,327 --> 00:56:22,840
It's beautiful.

708
00:56:24,807 --> 00:56:27,052
It's like liquid.

709
00:56:27,087 --> 00:56:30,527
It slides all over everything.

710
00:56:30,562 --> 00:56:33,772
Comes up in waves.

711
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:36,687
And they just kept hitting him,

712
00:56:36,722 --> 00:56:39,852
wave after wave.

713
00:56:39,887 --> 00:56:42,887
He was screaming for me to save him.

714
00:56:42,922 --> 00:56:45,452
What did you do?

715
00:56:45,487 --> 00:56:48,160
I did the only thing I could.

716
00:56:50,127 --> 00:56:53,915
I closed the lifeboat hatch,
and I left him behind.

717
00:56:57,367 --> 00:57:00,847
I swore I'd never lose another man.

718
00:57:00,882 --> 00:57:03,204
I've known you a long time.

719
00:57:03,239 --> 00:57:05,492
You never told me that.

720
00:57:05,527 --> 00:57:08,887
That's just it, DJ.
I never told anybody.

721
00:57:08,922 --> 00:57:11,372
But this ship knew about it.

722
00:57:11,407 --> 00:57:15,567
It knows my fears.
It knows my secrets.

723
00:57:15,602 --> 00:57:19,727
Gets inside your head,
and it shows you.

724
00:57:19,762 --> 00:57:22,082
I wasn't going to tell you this.

725
00:57:23,727 --> 00:57:27,527
I've been listening
to the distress signal,

726
00:57:27,562 --> 00:57:29,438
and I, um...

727
00:57:31,247 --> 00:57:34,205
think I made a mistake
in the translation.

728
00:57:35,767 --> 00:57:39,601
Liberate tutemet...

729
00:57:42,487 --> 00:57:43,840
Go on.

730
00:57:45,567 --> 00:57:48,247
I thought it said "liberate me"...

731
00:57:48,282 --> 00:57:50,092
"Save me. "

732
00:57:50,127 --> 00:57:53,092
But it's not "me. "

733
00:57:53,127 --> 00:57:56,007
It's "liberate tutemet"...

734
00:57:56,042 --> 00:57:58,244
"Save yourself. "

735
00:57:58,279 --> 00:58:00,412
And it gets worse.

736
00:58:00,447 --> 00:58:03,967
Liberate tutemet ex inferis.

737
00:58:04,002 --> 00:58:05,525
There.

738
00:58:06,847 --> 00:58:08,692
I think...

739
00:58:08,727 --> 00:58:12,007
That says "ex inferis. "

740
00:58:12,042 --> 00:58:15,222
"Save yourself...

741
00:58:15,257 --> 00:58:18,403
"from hell. "

742
00:58:19,887 --> 00:58:23,687
Look, if what Dr Weir
tells us is true,

743
00:58:23,722 --> 00:58:25,612
this ship has been beyond

744
00:58:25,647 --> 00:58:28,287
the boundaries of our universe,

745
00:58:28,322 --> 00:58:31,004
of known scientific reality.

746
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:33,687
Who knows where it's been,

747
00:58:33,722 --> 00:58:36,076
what it's seen...

748
00:58:38,127 --> 00:58:40,527
and what it's brought back with it?

749
00:58:40,562 --> 00:58:42,677
From hell.

750
00:58:45,687 --> 00:58:48,679
You don't believe
in that stuff, do you?

751
00:58:51,927 --> 00:58:56,687
Whoever sent that message,
he sure believes in hell.

752
00:58:56,722 --> 00:58:58,643
Captain Miller!

753
00:59:01,927 --> 00:59:03,772
It better be good, Coop.

754
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:07,847
Ready to repressurise
the Clark and get out of here.

755
00:59:07,882 --> 00:59:09,326
On my way.

756
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:15,919
Come on, baby. Don't let me down.

757
00:59:22,647 --> 00:59:24,667
Hello, baby.

758
00:59:24,702 --> 00:59:26,954
Papa's home.

759
00:59:26,989 --> 00:59:29,207
She's holding.

760
00:59:29,242 --> 00:59:30,532
Oh, shit.

761
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,167
Skipper, we're still venting
trace gasses.

762
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:35,704
Give me 20 minutes to plug it.

763
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:38,088
Cooper, you are the life-saver.

764
00:59:38,123 --> 00:59:40,437
20 minutes and we're under way.

765
00:59:43,727 --> 00:59:45,638
Shit.

766
00:59:47,527 --> 00:59:49,452
Got any coffee?

767
00:59:49,487 --> 00:59:51,407
Yeah, but it's cold.

768
00:59:51,442 --> 00:59:52,920
Great.

769
01:00:18,727 --> 01:00:23,881
Liberate tutemet ex inferis.

770
01:00:30,327 --> 01:00:32,079
We're leaving.

771
01:00:34,167 --> 01:00:36,044
No, we can't leave.

772
01:00:37,447 --> 01:00:39,692
Our orders are specific.

773
01:00:39,727 --> 01:00:42,132
Rescue the crew, salvage the ship.

774
01:00:42,167 --> 01:00:45,027
They're dead, Doctor.
Your ship killed them.

775
01:00:45,062 --> 01:00:47,887
- We came to do a job.
- We're aborting!

776
01:00:47,922 --> 01:00:49,372
Starck, download the files

777
01:00:49,407 --> 01:00:51,212
from the Event Horizon's computers.

778
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:55,447
DJ, get Justin prepped
and ready to move to the Clark.

779
01:00:55,482 --> 01:00:57,332
There's stuff I want from Medical.

780
01:00:57,367 --> 01:01:01,007
- Move him to the tank.
- No problem. Do it.

781
01:01:01,042 --> 01:01:02,812
- Peters.
- Yes, sir.

782
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:05,998
Get the CO2 scrubbers.
Take Smitty with you.

783
01:01:12,887 --> 01:01:14,625
Don't do this.

784
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:16,364
It's done.

785
01:01:18,127 --> 01:01:19,572
You can't leave my ship!

786
01:01:19,607 --> 01:01:22,047
I have no intention of leaving her.

787
01:01:22,082 --> 01:01:24,572
I will take the Lewis & Clark

788
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:28,287
and launch TAC missiles
at the Event Horizon.

789
01:01:28,322 --> 01:01:29,800
No.

790
01:01:36,887 --> 01:01:39,932
Captain, bio-scans
just went off the scale.

791
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:43,607
The core's draining power
from the rest of the ship.

792
01:01:43,642 --> 01:01:47,087
Get the files.
Vacate. I want off this ship.

793
01:01:47,122 --> 01:01:50,692
You can't leave. She won't let you.

794
01:01:50,727 --> 01:01:53,958
Just get your gear
or you're walking home.

795
01:01:54,007 --> 01:01:56,157
I am home.

796
01:01:57,447 --> 01:01:59,147
Let's go!

797
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:00,771
Ready?

798
01:02:00,806 --> 01:02:02,360
Shot.

799
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:05,647
Come on. Come on.

800
01:02:05,682 --> 01:02:07,121
Ready?

801
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:08,560
Shot.

802
01:02:12,367 --> 01:02:13,932
Shot. OK.

803
01:02:13,967 --> 01:02:16,772
Can we go? This place freaks me out.

804
01:02:16,807 --> 01:02:20,127
- You wanna breathe going home?
- No! Let's go!

805
01:02:20,162 --> 01:02:22,224
Shit! 25! Come on!

806
01:02:22,259 --> 01:02:24,410
We need 25! Peters!

807
01:02:24,445 --> 01:02:26,562
Come out! Got it!

808
01:04:45,447 --> 01:04:47,358
Oh, no, Peters.

809
01:04:52,527 --> 01:04:54,722
Oh, God.

810
01:05:22,287 --> 01:05:23,879
It's me. I'm home.

811
01:05:25,527 --> 01:05:27,643
I'm home.

812
01:05:31,487 --> 01:05:35,127
I know I wasn't there
when you needed me, and...

813
01:05:35,162 --> 01:05:37,572
I'm sorry I...

814
01:05:37,607 --> 01:05:41,156
I let my work come between us.

815
01:05:44,927 --> 01:05:46,847
God, Claire, no.

816
01:05:46,882 --> 01:05:48,732
I'm begging you.

817
01:05:48,767 --> 01:05:50,862
Please, please don't.

818
01:05:50,897 --> 01:05:52,958
Not again, please.

819
01:05:54,487 --> 01:05:56,478
I've been so...

820
01:06:00,247 --> 01:06:02,556
I've been so...

821
01:06:04,087 --> 01:06:06,412
Billy.

822
01:06:06,447 --> 01:06:08,165
It's all right.

823
01:06:09,847 --> 01:06:12,652
I've been so alone.

824
01:06:12,687 --> 01:06:16,007
You'll never be alone again.

825
01:06:16,042 --> 01:06:18,224
You're with me now.

826
01:06:18,259 --> 01:06:20,372
You're with me,

827
01:06:20,407 --> 01:06:25,207
and I have such wonderful,
wonderful things...

828
01:06:25,242 --> 01:06:26,606
to show you.

829
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:46,323
Damn, I'm good!

830
01:06:50,527 --> 01:06:53,407
Coop, how long are you going to take?

831
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:56,252
You can kiss my ass, Smith. I'm done.

832
01:06:56,287 --> 01:07:00,087
Just let me collect my tools,
and we can go.

833
01:07:00,122 --> 01:07:02,647
- Two minutes, tops.
- Roger that.

834
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:23,567
Dr Weir, get your ass
back on board now! Weir!

835
01:07:23,602 --> 01:07:25,372
Shit.

836
01:07:25,407 --> 01:07:30,367
Captain Miller, do you copy? Over.

837
01:07:30,402 --> 01:07:31,492
Go ahead, Smitty.

838
01:07:31,527 --> 01:07:35,447
I've just seen Weir messing
around on the Clark, sir.

839
01:07:35,482 --> 01:07:39,440
Stand by, Smitty.
I wanna check something out.

840
01:07:43,927 --> 01:07:46,732
- Smith, get out.
- Come again, sir?

841
01:07:46,767 --> 01:07:50,187
Explosives are missing.
Weir's put it on Clark.

842
01:07:50,222 --> 01:07:53,607
No, sir. No way.
I've just put it back together.

843
01:07:53,642 --> 01:07:55,086
Get off there, Smith!

844
01:08:04,687 --> 01:08:06,678
Where the fuck are you?

845
01:08:28,447 --> 01:08:29,972
Got you.

846
01:08:30,007 --> 01:08:31,599
Hang on, Smitty! I'm coming!

847
01:08:44,567 --> 01:08:46,876
No!

848
01:08:52,887 --> 01:08:54,081
Shit!

849
01:09:34,927 --> 01:09:35,892
Shit!

850
01:09:35,927 --> 01:09:37,772
Where the fuck am I going?

851
01:09:37,807 --> 01:09:40,799
Why does this shit happen
to me? Fuck.

852
01:09:43,047 --> 01:09:44,927
All right, think, Coop. Think. Think!

853
01:09:44,962 --> 01:09:48,572
Get back to the ship.

854
01:09:48,607 --> 01:09:52,202
Blow my air tank.
I'll blow my air tank.

855
01:09:54,167 --> 01:09:55,212
All right. Fuck.

856
01:09:55,247 --> 01:09:56,927
Oh, this better work.

857
01:09:56,962 --> 01:09:58,572
This shit better work.

858
01:09:58,607 --> 01:10:01,247
Here I go. One, two, three.

859
01:10:01,282 --> 01:10:02,704
Come on. Come on!

860
01:10:02,739 --> 01:10:04,873
Come on! Yes!

861
01:10:04,908 --> 01:10:06,972
Yes! Yes!

862
01:10:07,007 --> 01:10:09,362
Here I come, motherfuckers!

863
01:10:17,967 --> 01:10:19,292
What was that?

864
01:10:19,327 --> 01:10:22,927
Clark's gone.
Smitty and Cooper are dead.

865
01:10:22,962 --> 01:10:24,252
What the...?

866
01:10:24,287 --> 01:10:26,487
You spot Weir, take him out.

867
01:10:26,522 --> 01:10:28,464
Understood.

868
01:10:28,499 --> 01:10:30,372
Be careful, DJ.

869
01:10:30,407 --> 01:10:32,264
Don't worry about Weir.

870
01:10:32,299 --> 01:10:34,122
I'll take care of him.

871
01:10:56,887 --> 01:11:00,675
DJ! DJ, answer me!

872
01:11:46,207 --> 01:11:48,198
OK, Dr Weir.

873
01:11:52,967 --> 01:11:55,367
You don't wanna leave your ship?

874
01:11:55,402 --> 01:11:57,676
You never will.

875
01:13:16,527 --> 01:13:18,438
It's OK.

876
01:13:22,247 --> 01:13:24,397
I'll get you out of here.

877
01:13:32,607 --> 01:13:34,563
Easy.

878
01:13:47,887 --> 01:13:50,879
Oh, my God.

879
01:13:52,207 --> 01:13:54,132
What happened to your eyes?

880
01:13:54,167 --> 01:13:58,047
Where we're going,
we won't need eyes to see.

881
01:13:58,082 --> 01:14:00,012
What are you talking about?

882
01:14:00,047 --> 01:14:04,167
I created the Event Horizon
to reach the stars,

883
01:14:04,202 --> 01:14:08,287
but she's gone much,
much further than that.

884
01:14:08,322 --> 01:14:11,464
She tore a hole in our universe...

885
01:14:11,499 --> 01:14:14,607
a gateway to another dimension...

886
01:14:14,642 --> 01:14:18,287
a dimension of pure chaos...

887
01:14:18,322 --> 01:14:20,652
pure evil.

888
01:14:20,687 --> 01:14:24,647
When she crossed over,
she was just a ship,

889
01:14:24,682 --> 01:14:27,887
but when she came back...

890
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:30,732
she was alive.

891
01:14:30,767 --> 01:14:33,907
Look at her, Miller.

892
01:14:33,942 --> 01:14:37,012
Isn't she beautiful?

893
01:14:37,047 --> 01:14:41,199
Your beautiful ship
killed its crew, Doctor.

894
01:14:42,487 --> 01:14:45,092
Well...

895
01:14:45,127 --> 01:14:47,357
now she has another crew.

896
01:14:49,007 --> 01:14:51,396
Now she has us.

897
01:14:57,647 --> 01:14:59,852
What do you think
you're doing, Doctor?

898
01:14:59,887 --> 01:15:04,327
You wanted to know
where the ship has been...

899
01:15:04,362 --> 01:15:06,636
so now you'll find out.

900
01:15:18,687 --> 01:15:21,407
If you miss me,
you blow out the hull.

901
01:15:21,442 --> 01:15:24,558
What makes you think I'll miss?

902
01:15:25,847 --> 01:15:27,332
That's right! I'm back!

903
01:15:27,367 --> 01:15:29,927
I'm... oh, shit! I can't stop! Hey!

904
01:15:29,962 --> 01:15:31,679
Hey! Fuck.

905
01:15:33,207 --> 01:15:34,923
What?! Who the fuck?!

906
01:15:34,958 --> 01:15:36,639
Who the...? Oh, shit!

907
01:15:42,327 --> 01:15:43,316
No!

908
01:17:22,927 --> 01:17:23,916
Give me your hand!

909
01:17:32,447 --> 01:17:35,598
- Come on!
- I can't!

910
01:17:37,367 --> 01:17:39,119
I'm not leaving you!

911
01:17:57,967 --> 01:17:59,923
Forward airlock.

912
01:18:05,047 --> 01:18:07,492
It can't be Weir.

913
01:18:07,527 --> 01:18:09,447
I'm not taking any chances.

914
01:18:09,482 --> 01:18:11,358
You watch your back.

915
01:18:21,927 --> 01:18:23,838
Yo! Don't hit me!

916
01:18:25,487 --> 01:18:27,652
Take it off! Take it off!

917
01:18:27,687 --> 01:18:29,887
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

918
01:18:29,922 --> 01:18:32,087
You're OK. You're OK. It's over.

919
01:18:32,122 --> 01:18:33,732
No, it's not.

920
01:18:33,767 --> 01:18:36,927
Weir's activated the gravity
drive. We got to shut it down.

921
01:18:36,962 --> 01:18:40,727
- How? The bridge is gone.
- What about Engineering?

922
01:18:40,762 --> 01:18:42,612
Dr Weir was the expert.

923
01:18:42,647 --> 01:18:46,127
I don't want to go
where the other crew went.

924
01:18:46,162 --> 01:18:47,532
We'll blow it.

925
01:18:47,567 --> 01:18:49,927
- Blow it?
- Like Weir said.

926
01:18:49,962 --> 01:18:51,360
Blow the corridor,

927
01:18:51,407 --> 01:18:55,241
separate us from the ship,
use the foredecks as a lifeboat.

928
01:18:56,527 --> 01:18:58,932
TDRS should pick up
our emergency beacon.

929
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:02,607
We put ourselves in stasis,
and stand by for rescue.

930
01:19:02,642 --> 01:19:04,607
I'll manually arm these explosives.

931
01:19:04,642 --> 01:19:06,052
Skipper, will this work?

932
01:19:06,087 --> 01:19:09,607
Go activate the emergency beacon
and you get back here.

933
01:19:09,642 --> 01:19:11,927
- Yes, sir.
- I'm coming.

934
01:19:11,962 --> 01:19:13,326
You stay here.

935
01:19:16,007 --> 01:19:18,237
Close this door behind me,
Lieutenant.

936
01:19:28,087 --> 01:19:32,000
Gateway opening
in T-minus five minutes.

937
01:19:38,287 --> 01:19:40,562
Emergency beacon activated.

938
01:19:42,087 --> 01:19:43,703
Yes.

939
01:19:43,738 --> 01:19:45,320
Blood?

940
01:19:52,727 --> 01:19:54,802
Oh, fuck me.

941
01:19:54,837 --> 01:19:56,878
Fuck me.

942
01:20:26,247 --> 01:20:27,566
Run!

943
01:20:30,087 --> 01:20:34,285
Gateway opening
in T-minus three minutes.

944
01:20:37,567 --> 01:20:40,604
Detonator release is authorised.

945
01:20:42,007 --> 01:20:44,367
The main corridor is now armed.

946
01:20:44,402 --> 01:20:46,884
We're armed. She's ready to blow.

947
01:20:46,919 --> 01:20:49,863
I repeat. She's ready to blow.

948
01:20:49,898 --> 01:20:52,848
Miller. Miller, can you hear me?

949
01:20:52,883 --> 01:20:55,799
We have to get out of here now.

950
01:20:56,927 --> 01:20:58,758
You let me burn!

951
01:21:15,927 --> 01:21:20,364
Gateway opening
in T-minus two minutes.

952
01:21:55,527 --> 01:21:57,358
You left me behind.

953
01:21:58,967 --> 01:22:02,562
No, you're not Edward Corrick.
I watched him die.

954
01:22:06,247 --> 01:22:07,680
Weir?

955
01:22:10,167 --> 01:22:12,092
The ship brought me back.

956
01:22:12,127 --> 01:22:15,127
I told you she won't let me leave.

957
01:22:15,162 --> 01:22:16,972
She won't let anyone leave.

958
01:22:17,007 --> 01:22:20,207
Did you really think
you could destroy this ship?

959
01:22:20,242 --> 01:22:23,212
She's defied space and time.

960
01:22:23,247 --> 01:22:26,687
She's been to a place
you couldn't possibly imagine.

961
01:22:26,722 --> 01:22:28,412
And now...

962
01:22:28,447 --> 01:22:30,967
it is time to go back.

963
01:22:31,002 --> 01:22:33,212
I know. To hell.

964
01:22:33,247 --> 01:22:37,047
You know nothing.
Hell is only a word.

965
01:22:37,082 --> 01:22:41,120
The reality is much, much worse.

966
01:22:43,327 --> 01:22:46,205
Now let me show you.

967
01:22:47,927 --> 01:22:49,121
Help me!

968
01:22:51,447 --> 01:22:54,007
No!

969
01:22:55,367 --> 01:22:57,227
No. No. No.

970
01:22:57,262 --> 01:22:59,052
You see?

971
01:22:59,087 --> 01:23:02,447
No, they're not dead.
They're not dead.

972
01:23:02,482 --> 01:23:04,199
Not yet.

973
01:23:06,527 --> 01:23:08,864
You - won't -

974
01:23:08,899 --> 01:23:11,201
take - my - crew!

975
01:23:29,447 --> 01:23:31,727
They're not your crew any more.

976
01:23:31,762 --> 01:23:33,647
They belong to the ship.

977
01:23:33,682 --> 01:23:36,081
Gateway opening.

978
01:23:48,847 --> 01:23:50,732
Take me.

979
01:23:50,767 --> 01:23:53,607
You take me! You leave them alone!

980
01:23:53,642 --> 01:23:55,292
No.

981
01:23:55,327 --> 01:23:57,079
There is no escape.

982
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:00,612
The gateway is open,

983
01:24:00,647 --> 01:24:03,957
and you are all coming with me.

984
01:24:08,327 --> 01:24:09,919
Do you see?

985
01:24:12,967 --> 01:24:15,845
Do you see?

986
01:24:17,607 --> 01:24:19,040
Do you see?!

987
01:24:21,247 --> 01:24:22,475
Yes...

988
01:24:23,767 --> 01:24:25,439
I see.

989
01:24:29,207 --> 01:24:34,076
No!

990
01:25:56,167 --> 01:26:00,372
This is Rescue One. We have contact.

991
01:26:00,407 --> 01:26:03,527
Approaching the wreckage
of the Event Horizon.

992
01:26:03,562 --> 01:26:05,324
Prepare to board.

993
01:26:14,407 --> 01:26:17,252
I'm entering the grav couch bay.

994
01:26:17,287 --> 01:26:21,121
It doesn't appear to have been
damaged in the explosion.

995
01:26:22,727 --> 01:26:25,947
There appear to be three survivors:

996
01:26:25,982 --> 01:26:29,132
Cooper, Justin, Lieutenant Starck.

997
01:26:29,167 --> 01:26:32,647
Justin seems to have suffered
massive injuries,

998
01:26:32,682 --> 01:26:34,444
but he's still alive.

999
01:26:35,487 --> 01:26:38,081
The grav couches still have power.

1000
01:26:40,687 --> 01:26:43,155
I'm opening the first tank now.

1001
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:54,687
It's all right. It's OK.

1002
01:26:54,722 --> 01:26:56,144
You're safe now.

1003
01:26:56,179 --> 01:26:57,532
Justin. Cooper.

1004
01:26:57,567 --> 01:26:59,887
They're fine. They're fine.
They're with us.

1005
01:26:59,922 --> 01:27:01,479
You're with us.

1006
01:27:04,367 --> 01:27:05,612
Starck.

1007
01:27:05,647 --> 01:27:07,367
Stay calm. It's all right.

1008
01:27:07,402 --> 01:27:08,924
Starck, calm down. It's me.

1009
01:27:08,959 --> 01:27:10,643
Breathe deeply. Breathe deeply.

1010
01:27:10,678 --> 01:27:12,327
I need a sedative here now!

1011
01:27:12,362 --> 01:27:14,247
I got you, Starck..

1012
01:27:14,282 --> 01:27:15,532
It's OK.

1013
01:27:15,567 --> 01:27:17,172
Sedative now!

1014
01:27:17,207 --> 01:27:19,107
Starck, we're safe.

1015
01:27:19,142 --> 01:27:21,007
OK, OK! I need it now!

1016
01:27:21,042 --> 01:27:22,201
We're safe.

1017
01:31:44,007 --> 01:31:47,602
...guess what...
