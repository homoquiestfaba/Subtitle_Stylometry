00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:55,006
Lasts anywhere from a
couple hours to a week,

368
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,075
depending on how wet or dry the ground,

369
00:22:57,108 --> 00:22:59,277
how rough or smooth the thing you touch.

370
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:00,345
Can you cover it up?

371
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:03,114
Sure, water'd cover it up,
but you gotta come out

372
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:04,015
of the water sometime.

373
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,018
Another animal crossing it would cover it,

374
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,754
but no matter how much
you try to confuse 'em,

375
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:12,657
that dog, he'll always find his man,

376
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:15,760
as you're about to find out,
if he's been trained right,

377
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:16,761
that is.

378
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,163
All right! That's enough.

379
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:20,699
You don't want them dogs throwin' up!

380
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,300
All right, boy, get in.

381
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:24,169
Which one? Any one?

382
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:27,038
Everything they did,
except for the last one.

383
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,139
Then you stay put.

384
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:29,875
Won't the dog see me go in?

385
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,911
Just do as I say, boy.

386
00:23:55,333 --> 00:24:00,071
( Farts ) Oh...

387
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,374
Oh!!!

388
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:05,076
( Laughing ) Come on. That's it.

389
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:14,085
That's good, doggy.

390
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,621
All right, everybody!

391
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:18,223
The party's over.

392
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:19,758
Get back to the kennels.

393
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,626
Them dogs need grooming.

394
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:28,733
That's it. Search!

395
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:39,670
( Dog panting, grunting ) Come on.

396
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,882
( Growling ) ( Barking )

397
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:00,899
Heel! Heel!

398
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:04,669
( Chuckles ) That's a good boy.

399
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,271
That's a good boy.

400
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:11,009
Can I come out now,
or are we going for round two?

401
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:15,080
( Chuckles ) Does it bother you at all

402
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:17,882
that we're training dogs
to track men like US?

403
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:19,951
Hmm! Not a bit.

404
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:23,755
Hey, that reminds me... last night,
I heard dogs

405
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:26,291
barking just like he was
when we were outside.

406
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:27,826
We had a runner.

407
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,227
Yeah?

408
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,762
What happened?

409
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:33,298
Well, same thing that always happens.

410
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:34,966
Dogs ran him down.

411
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,901
Damn.

412
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:44,109
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

413
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:45,243
Thanks.

414
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:50,015
Man, that's gotta hurt,
running free like that,

415
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,183
and then all of a sudden, boom, right back

416
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,385
behind bars.

417
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:55,987
Not back behind bars.

418
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:57,489
Back to the morgue.

419
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:58,490
He fought the dogs.

420
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:01,493
They killed him before
we could run up to them.

421
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:03,061
Jesus.

422
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:06,164
New fish like you, name of smitty.

423
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:07,932
He should've asked.

424
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:09,467
Somebody would've told him.

425
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:12,871
Can't run at retrieve.

426
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,807
He knew. Knew?

427
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,010
He is the guy who told me
that no one runs from retrieve.

428
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,379
The guy had been here before.

429
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,516
I thought you were a standalone guy.

430
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:27,419
What you worried about this con for?

431
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:30,088
( Scoffs ) I'm not worried about this con.

432
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:36,428
I'm just trying to figure things out,
you know, learn.

433
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:40,231
Learn two things: You fuck up,

434
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,233
you answer to captain brown.

435
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:46,504
You run, them dogs will eat your ass.

436
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:49,174
Understand?

437
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:05,457
Julian, you still up, mon?

438
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,992
What the hell you doing out of bed?

439
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:10,895
I'm nursing the sick dog,
mon. What are you doing?

440
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,397
I'm just reading my book.

441
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,466
You are? Reading a book?

442
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:17,535
Oh, I bet you one of them guys who got some

443
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,003
good schooling, right?

444
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:21,272
I bet you that you come from a good family

445
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,540
and a good home, right?

446
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:25,276
Yeah, well, you shouldn't bet, then.

447
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,911
My parents died when I was 13.

448
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:28,546
I've been on my own ever since.

449
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,949
Oh, shit, hey, I'm sorry, mon.

450
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,884
I didn't know. Nah.

451
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:37,388
Shit. It's rough, mon,
'cause, you know, a man

452
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:40,058
needs his friend and
family to come visit him

453
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:41,226
in a place like this.

454
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:42,393
You know what I mean?

455
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:44,496
Who you got visiting you?

456
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:46,231
Who, me? You know...

457
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:48,867
I got a girl come by once a month,
you know.

458
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,034
Yeah?

459
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:51,236
Yeah.

460
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,338
Is she pretty?

461
00:27:55,406 --> 00:27:57,842
Social worker.

462
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,396
( Laughs ) Hey! Either get in the sack

463
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,049
together, or shut the fuck up!

464
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,851
Hey, Julian, just forget it.

465
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:11,256
( Shouting, dog barking ) We got a runner.

466
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:12,290
Guard: Let's go get him.

467
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:13,424
Come on.

468
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:14,425
Go get him.

469
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:15,426
Here we go!

470
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,895
Come on, where's he at?

471
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:18,496
Where's he at?

472
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:22,200
Let's get him!

473
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:23,968
( Door slams ) Yo, what's up, rasta?

474
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:43,121
Prisoner Owens to see his visitor.

475
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:45,123
That's right, a miss Chadwick,

476
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:46,224
his social worker.

477
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:47,458
She brought him this.

478
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:49,060
A Bible!

479
00:28:49,093 --> 00:28:50,662
Won't do you any good, Willy!

480
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:51,563
No pictures.

481
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:54,065
Yeah. You know something, this is mighty

482
00:28:54,098 --> 00:28:55,200
fine paper, though.

483
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,336
Think I'll roll a few joints,
have myself a holy smoke.

484
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:01,239
You do that,
and you will feel the wrath of god, boy.

485
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:02,507
Amen to that, brother.

486
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,108
I'm just joking, boss.

487
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:06,144
Shut the fuck up and get in there!

488
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:07,478
All right. No problem.

489
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:09,180
On my way.

490
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:17,214
Straighten out that hat, asshole.

491
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,228
Hello.

492
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,396
Hi, will! How you doing?

493
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,564
You're looking good.

494
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,033
Looks like they've been feeding you well.

495
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:31,236
You get the copy of the
good book I sent you?

496
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,537
Yes, yes, great, mon.

497
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:34,138
It come in real handy-like.

498
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:36,574
I'll pick it up on the way
back to the doghouse.

499
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,677
By the way,
you're looking pretty chipper yourself

500
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:40,645
there, miss Chadwick.

501
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:43,147
Is it all right here, you know what I mean?

502
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:44,249
Yeah? Oh, yeah!

503
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,316
Safe as houses, mon.

504
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,987
This house is completely
bug-free. That's guaranteed.

505
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,121
Don't worry.

506
00:29:50,154 --> 00:29:53,091
Thank god,
because if we didn't quit this double act

507
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,392
soon I was gonna lose it.

508
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,628
Can we forget the accent for a second?

509
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:59,564
Yeah, I'll try,
but it's been like second nature

510
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:03,501
for me now... "Mon."

511
00:30:03,534 --> 00:30:06,638
So, uh, find anything yet?

512
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:09,240
We sure do have more
than our fair share of runners

513
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:11,976
for such a high-security prison,
you know what I mean,

514
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,579
but, uh, there's nothing I
can really put my finger on yet.

515
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:16,581
There's a quadrant of the prison grounds

516
00:30:16,614 --> 00:30:17,582
we never run.

517
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:18,449
Now, I wanna know why.

518
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,319
Oh, and there's this new guy on the unit.

519
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:22,320
His name is Julian Taylor.

520
00:30:22,353 --> 00:30:23,588
He's not like the rest.

521
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:25,189
You know, he's a good kid.

522
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:27,659
Not your normal scumbag,
if you know what I mean.

523
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:29,193
Can you use him?

524
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:32,130
Well, I'm working on it,
you know, gonna give him

525
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:36,200
a chance to show me who he is,
see if I can trust him.

526
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:40,038
By the way, ( Jamaican accent
) Have I told you how good

527
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:42,707
you're lookin' lately?

528
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:56,220
Keep your hand straight.

529
00:30:56,254 --> 00:30:57,322
Listen up.

530
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,224
You two run together today,
which makes you first-time

531
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,626
lucky, Taylor, with Willy b.

532
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:03,728
Here to break you in gentle-like.

533
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:06,397
You listen to him,
you won't come to much harm.

534
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,499
Captain brown wants double tracking.

535
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,201
What's double tracking?

536
00:31:10,234 --> 00:31:11,669
Willy knows the routine.

537
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,639
Lay down two sets of tracks,
split, cross over.

538
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:16,774
Couple of dogs follow Willy here.

539
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:18,643
Couple of other dogs follow you.

540
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:19,811
Why? I don't get it.

541
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:23,281
Well, sometimes we have
two or more cons who are stupid

542
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:26,084
enough to think that
they can reach that fence,

543
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:28,052
and we gotta train them dogs.

544
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:30,121
Now, is there anything else?

545
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:32,423
Yeah, I heard the dogs again last...

546
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:35,126
I want you to keep your eye on the track.

547
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:37,261
Willy here, he's got the route map.

548
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:40,331
You don't have to worry
about anything else.

549
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:41,499
Two for the gate.

550
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:43,501
Okay.

551
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:48,706
( Barking ) ( Men panting )

552
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,475
Hi, Hank.

553
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:15,833
You know, this road is not on this map,
you know?

554
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:18,136
Hey, neither is that shack.

555
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:21,439
Oh, man, don't tell me we're lost.

556
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:22,640
Well, you know what?

557
00:32:22,673 --> 00:32:26,511
I bet you we make a wrong turn
at that downed tree, remember?

558
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:29,380
I thought you told me
you never broke track,

559
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:30,848
you never got lost.

560
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:35,253
"Taylor, mon,
I always know exactly who and where I am."

561
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:38,156
Yeah, well, there's a first
time for everything, all right?

562
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:40,258
Yeah, well, let's get the hell outta here.

563
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,426
Wait, wait, wait.

564
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,693
Let's go check it out.

565
00:32:42,727 --> 00:32:44,395
Why?

566
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,798
Knowledge is a powerful thing, mon.

567
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:50,735
Yeah, well, we'd better get back on track.

568
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:52,770
Hey, Julian, stop.

569
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,206
J.! J., j., j., j.!

570
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:56,474
Look, we have time, mon.

571
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,509
The dogs have just get let go right now.

572
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,511
We have all the time in the world.

573
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:03,381
What the hell is going on here, Willy?

574
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,616
Going on? I just asked
you for a little help, man.

575
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,818
Friends help friends, right?

576
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:08,453
We're not friends, man.

577
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,521
We're just two cons running track.

578
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:13,491
That's not the way I see it, mon.

579
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:15,893
What do you want me to do?

580
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:18,229
All right, help me up the tree.

581
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:19,263
Why?

582
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,833
Uh... I'm gonna go tree to tree,
right, get near

583
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:23,568
the shack, come back same place.

584
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:24,735
The dogs can't track me.

585
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:25,870
So, you coming along?

586
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:27,939
What is this, fucking Tarzan and Jane?

587
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:28,906
No, I'm not coming.

588
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,242
I'll get you up the tree,
and then I'm running

589
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:32,243
my track, all right?

590
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:35,346
All right, Taylor, mon,
that's very friendly.

591
00:33:35,379 --> 00:33:36,781
Hey, tell me something.

592
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:39,484
You think you have something
good and you don't want

593
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,551
to mess with it, right?

594
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:41,619
Damn straight.

595
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:42,787
All right, here.

596
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,224
Take this map, go on the track,
and I'll catch up with you

597
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:48,793
before captain brown, okay?

598
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:08,479
♪♪ ( Organ ) Tragedy struck

599
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:30,401
In the quiet suburb of wallamaroo,
Sydney, today

600
00:34:30,434 --> 00:34:33,504
in the brutal slaying of
20-year-old concert soloist

601
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:34,472
Laura brown.

602
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:37,375
Escaped convict Jake
Henry has been apprehended

603
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,377
and has confessed to the murder.

604
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,246
A graduate of the
Australian school of music,

605
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,382
miss brown was known for her sensitive

606
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,884
interpretations of the
organ music of j.S. Bach.

607
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,420
Friends and colleagues are in shock over

608
00:34:49,453 --> 00:34:51,789
the senseless tragedy which has cut short

609
00:34:51,822 --> 00:34:54,358
a brilliant and promising career.

610
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:56,727
Another fatality at the scene of the crime

611
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,897
was Laura's faithful dog,
who was slain, it is thought,

612
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,999
while attempting to protect her.

613
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:05,036
Now, before an update on the weather,
we go over...

614
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:13,069
Now, what would Freud make of that,
captain? Hmm!

615
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:23,313
Now, what would Freud make of that,
captain? Hmm!

616
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,298
Holy shit.

617
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,542
Shh! Shh! Shh!

618
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:46,577
Look by the center fence pole.

619
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:47,845
Now, look on that bush.

620
00:35:47,878 --> 00:35:49,347
You see anything?

621
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,348
No.

622
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:51,782
Well, look again! Look!

623
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,050
Just look... look, see!

624
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,920
Ah, see? Captain brown likes to test a man,

625
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:58,389
run him near the fence and see if he makes

626
00:35:58,422 --> 00:35:59,390
a break for it.

627
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:00,391
Now, you see that?

628
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:01,468
He puts that guard out there.

629
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,961
He shoots you in the ass,
and you'll be leaving here

630
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,396
for good, feet first.

631
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:07,665
What do you care for, anyway, man?

632
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:09,033
You're my friend, mon!

633
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:10,668
You helped me up that tree!

634
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:18,542
Come on,
we still have some track left to run.

635
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:20,578
Hold!

636
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:28,986
( Growling ) You ran good tracks.

637
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,422
Got off once or twice, it looks like,

638
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,591
but good tracks.

639
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:38,429
Now get your asses back to the gate.

640
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:40,731
Hyah. All right, dogs!

641
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:48,372
Get walking!

642
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:52,777
Hey, why didn't you say anything?

643
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:53,854
'Cause I don't know anything.

644
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,380
Yeah, well,
you could've got in good with brown.

645
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:58,382
What do you think I am, a snitch?

646
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,384
Hey, want to know what I found? No.

647
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:02,520
Listen,
captain brown's doing some really bad shit.

648
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,521
I think we can stop him.

649
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,522
You got the wrong guy.

650
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:05,556
No, no, I don't think so.

651
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:08,859
You two,
stop your bullshitting and double-time

652
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,895
it back to the gate!

653
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:11,796
Right.

654
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:14,699
Tch! I really need somebody I can trust.

655
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:15,866
Well, it ain't me.

656
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,468
No, no, no, I think it is.

657
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:18,703
Well, think again.

658
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,771
Eh... tch!

659
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:40,057

boy.

660
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,893
Hey, boy.

661
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:43,961
Good boy.

662
00:37:43,994 --> 00:37:45,096
Kennel up.

663
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:46,897
Kennel up.

664
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,065
Good boy.

665
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:06,884
( Dog growls softly ) Shh.

666
00:38:21,665 --> 00:38:24,702
( Trapdoor creaks softly
) ( Dog growls softly )

667
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:12,750
Stay. Stay.

668
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,687
No! Aah!

669
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,089
Aah!

670
00:39:28,098 --> 00:39:30,634
Willy! Willy!

671
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:33,270
Cool it! Cool it!

672
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,239
There's nothing you can do!

673
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:37,007
No! Willy! Come here!

674
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,710
Call somebody!

675
00:39:39,743 --> 00:39:41,145
Get outta there!

676
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:44,849
( Alarm blaring ) Emergency! Emergen...

677
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,217
No fucking shit, man!

678
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,852
Contact infirmary!

679
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,987
Send for medics down here fast!

680
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,255
Man: Hey, what happened?

681
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,159
Come on, guys, tell me what's going on!

682
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:57,728
Oh, my god.

683
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,901
Kennel up! Bastard!

684
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:07,037
Rotten! You bastard!

685
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,272
You bastard!

686
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:11,308
You devil bastard! Bastard!

687
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,878
Drop that, pappy, or I will blow

688
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,679
your ugly head off.

689
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:20,851
How many times I have to tell you people...

690
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:23,320
Don't mess with the animals!

691
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:26,090
Show them some respect.

692
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:28,626
Clyde, kennel up.

693
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,698
What happened here, cap?

694
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:36,233
We don't know yet, sir.

695
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,736
This dogboy's supposed to be in bed.

696
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,204
He ain't meant to be in here.

697
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:43,007
We don't know why he got into Clyde's cage,
sir.

698
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,843
That dog is supposed to
be secured before a man

699
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:46,710
enters his cage.

700
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:49,113
Yes, sir, the dogboy knew that, sir.

701
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:52,082
I want your report on my desk by noon.

702
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,852
Yes, sir.

703
00:40:57,021 --> 00:41:00,024
What the hell are you doing, Taylor?

704
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:01,825
Nothing, boss.

705
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:04,261
I just going to help my friend.

706
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:07,398
Your friend is going
straight to the morgue,

707
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:10,134
and you are staying
right here and cleaning up

708
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:11,969
your friend's mess.

709
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:14,872
Right, now, let's break it up!

710
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:17,708
Pappy, you come with me.

711
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,143
Yes, boss.

712
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:24,348
All right, guys, hit the sack.

713
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:26,250
You heard the man, dogboy.

714
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:29,186
Start scrubbing.

715
00:41:55,212 --> 00:42:00,117
( Buzzer ) Oh... yes?

716
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,953
Deputy district attorney dern is here.

717
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:05,155
Oh, yeah. All right.

718
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,291
Ahem.

719
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:10,127
Adam Wakefield, Mr. Dern.

720
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,429
I'm pleased to make your acquaintance.

721
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:15,165
Actually, it's Ms. Dern, warden. Mr. Ewing

722
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,166
is my assistant.

723
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,901
Oh! ( Laughs ) Right.

724
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,236
You know, I assumed...

725
00:42:19,269 --> 00:42:20,270
Yeah, I'm sorry.

726
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:23,907
I do apologize, miss dern,
though I have to admit,

727
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:25,809
you about the best-looking d.A.

728
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:28,345
I've seen out here,
and I've seen most of them.

729
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,346
Thank you.

730
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,848
Cigarette?

731
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,983
So, you must be new on the team, dern.

732
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:34,451
Dern...

733
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:36,253
Was your father senator dern?

734
00:42:36,286 --> 00:42:37,254
Yes, sir.

735
00:42:37,287 --> 00:42:38,989
Oh! I voted for him.

736
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:41,358
He was a good man.

737
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,828
So, tell me,
what brings you out to retrieve?

738
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:51,869
The prisoner death in
the dog unit last night.

739
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:54,405
Well, you've got some pretty good sources.

740
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:56,140
We haven't put that out yet.

741
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:58,876
Of course, we don't know what we got yet.

742
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:02,046
A dog handler was
killed in one of the cages.

743
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,182
Thing is,
we don't know what he was doing in there.

744
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:07,051
He should've been in bed.

745
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:12,790
The name of the prisoner was Owens,
wilbur b.,

746
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:13,957
known as Willy b.

747
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:16,060
That's right.

748
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,861
He was one of ours.

749
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:21,265
One of yours?

750
00:43:21,298 --> 00:43:23,000
Uh, what are you saying?

751
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:26,970
Owens, wilbur b.,
is... was, really... detective

752
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:29,273
William mccarver on special assignment

753
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:30,207
to my office.

754
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,944
You put someone undercover in my prison?

755
00:43:33,977 --> 00:43:35,846
Operation backtrack.

756
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:38,248
We're working closely with a
number of federal agencies.

757
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,484
I don't give a damn if you're working

758
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:41,485
with Jesus Christ.

759
00:43:41,518 --> 00:43:44,221
I run this prison,
and you will goddamn well have

760
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:46,457
the professional courtesy
to inform me when you put

761
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:47,391
a man in here!

762
00:43:47,424 --> 00:43:50,194
Detective mccarver was investigating one

763
00:43:50,227 --> 00:43:52,129
of your senior guards, sir.

764
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:54,398
We didn't want to risk informing anyone

765
00:43:54,431 --> 00:43:55,966
in the prison structure.

766
00:43:55,999 --> 00:43:58,135
Oh, ho, I know what that means lady.

767
00:43:58,168 --> 00:44:00,170
That means you don't know whether I'm doing

768
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:03,841
whatever he's doing, whoever he is.

769
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:08,011
Eh, well, would you be kind
enough to tell me just who

770
00:44:08,045 --> 00:44:11,515
you're investigating on my staff?

771
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:14,885
Captain Robert brown.

772
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:17,821
Cap... uh, cap brown?

773
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:20,524
What'd he do, break a leash law?

774
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:23,861
Treasury and DEA have
been running an operation

775
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:26,530
monitoring money laundering
through offshore banks

776
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:27,564
in the Cayman Islands.

777
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:30,567
They picked up brown by
chance on a phone intercept

778
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:32,936
and traced it back.

779
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:36,140
Seemed he's made deposits totaling 960,000

780
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,442
in the past few years... not bad for a guy

781
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:40,444
making 60 a year with o.T.

782
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:43,347
Well, that's a feather in your cap,
isn't it,

783
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,349
if it's true.

784
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:48,418
We're treating this like a murder,
unless there's

785
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:51,255
strong evidence to the contrary.

786
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:54,458
You got a dead cop,
and I sympathize with that,

787
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:57,494
but the report says
that he failed to secure

788
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,930
a cage and a dog got loose.

789
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:03,400
Now,
he was someplace he wasn't supposed to be.

790
00:45:03,433 --> 00:45:05,602
If you had come to me in the first place,

791
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:08,572
then maybe his death could've been avoided!

792
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:11,608
Now, obviously,
I will treat this seriously, ma'am,

793
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:14,511
but any investigation
at retrieve is gonna run

794
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,246
through my office!

795
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,649
I understand.

796
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:21,351
We will coordinate everything through you.

797
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,619
Fair enough.

798
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:25,289
But I don't want anyone else knowing about

799
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:26,490
this investigation.

800
00:45:26,523 --> 00:45:28,392
Thank you for your time, warden.

801
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:30,394
Miss dern!

802
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:33,130
I don't want a dirty guard
in my prison anymore

803
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:34,064
than you do.

804
00:45:34,097 --> 00:45:38,368
If brown's head has to roll,
I'll deliver it

805
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,038
on a silver platter.

806
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:55,519
All right, on your feet!

807
00:45:55,552 --> 00:46:03,026
On your feet for cap brown now!

808
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,529
Okay, strip search.

809
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:07,331
Into the washroom.

810
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:10,367
Stark bollock naked.

811
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,669
Don't be embarrassed, boys.

812
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:15,706
Y'all been jerking them together, anyway.

813
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:17,474
Move!

814
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,714
Make it thorough, Mr. Walsh, understand?

815
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:25,115
Very good, sir.

816
00:46:25,148 --> 00:46:28,252
On the double!

817
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,587
Take the place apart, Mr. Wilkins.

818
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,256
What we looking for, cap?

819
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:35,492
I'll know it when I see it.

820
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:50,741
No contraband, sir.

821
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:53,977
Get me Taylor.

822
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:57,080
Taylor!

823
00:46:57,114 --> 00:47:00,984
Captain brown, front and center!

824
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:03,086
On the double!

825
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:09,226
You and Willy b.

826
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:11,395
Were getting tight.

827
00:47:12,562 --> 00:47:14,464
I guess.

828
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:17,367
( Chuckles ) You guess.

829
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:21,305
You been any closer,
you'd be planning a family.

830
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:24,107
I've been running cons a long time, son.

831
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:25,676
I know how it goes.

832
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:30,080
Ain't no con can keep a
secret when he's got a buddy.

833
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:34,518
Prison's too hard without sharing.

834
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:38,422
What was Willy doing in the kennels?

835
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:40,791
I don't know.

836
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:42,225
I was asleep.

837
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:44,761
He didn't tell me.

838
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:50,133
Where's Willy b.'S stash?

839
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:53,136
What stash?

840
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:55,539
Bullshit, son, you are really starting

841
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:57,674
to piss me off.

842
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,310
Every one of you's got a stash...

843
00:48:00,344 --> 00:48:06,550
Little bit of weed, a shank,
a picture of some bitch.

844
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:10,354
He didn't tell me.

845
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,656
You know what you are, Taylor?

846
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:16,560
You're one of those half-smart
boys who thinks he knows

847
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:17,561
how it works.

848
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:19,363
You know what happens to them?

849
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:27,396
My dogs run 'em down,
and I shoot 'em off the fence.

850
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:37,514
What have you found out
about your dogboy's death?

851
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:39,516
Nothing yet.

852
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:42,085
Do you see this causing any problems?

853
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:44,688
Problems? What kind of problems?

854
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:47,524
He ain't the first con
that's died because he was

855
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:49,860
in the wrong place doing the wrong thing.

856
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:52,195
He was a cop.

857
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:59,403
( Phone ringing ) Ewing.

858
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,405
Who is it?

859
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,340
It's that dern bitch.

860
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:07,611
Y-Yeah, but Wakefield could be right,
Jennifer.

861
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:09,613
The guy was in a cage with a wild dog.

862
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:10,814
It could've been an accident.

863
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:14,551
Will mccarver was too smart
to make that sort of mistake.

864
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:17,220
Now, the last thing will
told me was that there was

865
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:19,489
this new dogboy that
he thought he could trust.

866
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:20,624
Don't shine a light on him.

867
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:22,626
If they kill mccarver, they'll be looking

868
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:23,660
for his friends.

869
00:49:23,693 --> 00:49:26,363
You think I haven't
already thought about that?

870
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:28,799
What I'm gonna need are
prison records on the dog unit

871
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:31,301
going back five years,
but don't ask Wakefield for them.

872
00:49:31,334 --> 00:49:32,302
Find another source.

873
00:49:32,335 --> 00:49:34,504
How am I supposed to do that.

874
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:36,840
Get arrested.

875
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:41,645
So, what did she say?

876
00:49:41,678 --> 00:49:49,678
( Chuckles ) Well,
she said... get arrested.

877
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:53,356
Warden Wakefield, I'd like to apologize

878
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,926
for the way I've gone
about this investigation.

879
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:58,628
It was arrogant and wrong
of me to insert an agent here

880
00:49:58,662 --> 00:49:59,863
without first consulting you.

881
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:02,199
I hope you'll forgive me
and allow me to continue

882
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:03,200
my work here.

883
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:04,568
Oh, thank you!

884
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:06,536
That's very handsome.

885
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,672
Do, do sit down.

886
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:11,942
But, miss dern,
I don't know how you can handle this matter

887
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:13,543
any better than I can.

888
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:16,446
Well, maybe I can't,
warden, but will mccarver

889
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,547
was my partner.

890
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:18,548
You were a cop.

891
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:20,484
You know what that means.

892
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,686
I have to try.

893
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:25,455
Where would you like to start?

894
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:28,592
Well, I'd like to talk to
the men in the dog unit,

895
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,827
and then have a word with captain brown.

896
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,762
( Chuckles ) Sure.

897
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:35,866
We can do that for you right here and now.

898
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:38,335
Be my guest.

899
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:49,346
She can interrogate me anytime.

900
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:52,649
Great personality.

901
00:50:52,682 --> 00:51:00,682
( Laughing ) Inside, Taylor.

902
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:09,699
Mr. Taylor,
deputy district attorney Jennifer dern.

903
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,835
Please.

904
00:51:18,775 --> 00:51:21,545
Says here you've only
been in a couple of months.

905
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,680
How do you like working the animal unit?

906
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:26,316
I'm in prison, lady.

907
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:33,023
"Like" isn't a real big part
of it. I just do what I'm told.

908
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:39,996
Willy b. Said he could trust you.

909
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:42,465
His real name was William mccarver.

910
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:45,535
He was an undercover
agent working for my office.

911
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:48,838
We believe captain brown
is doing something illegal

912
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:53,610
in this prison and will,
Willy b., was investigating it.

913
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:54,778
Where are you going?

914
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:56,780
Look, I don't want to know any more.

915
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:57,781
I don't want to hear any more.

916
00:51:57,814 --> 00:52:00,417
Someone like you comes
in here and starts talking

917
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,519
to someone like me, I'll be dead in a week.

918
00:52:02,552 --> 00:52:05,989
I need your help to find
out what happened to will.

919
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:09,960
( Scoffs ) Good luck.

920
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:15,398
( Sighs ) That's the last one, ma'am.

921
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,339
Can I escort you to your car?

922
00:52:22,372 --> 00:52:23,807
Uh, thanks, no.

923
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,009
I have an appointment with captain brown.

924
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:27,010
Do you know where he is?

925
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:29,512
I believe he has a v.I.P. Day.

926
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:30,947
A v.I.P. Day?

927
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,617
Yes, ma'am. Every now and again they like

928
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,085
to come down and ride along.

929
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:37,654
Captain says it's good for the program.

930
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:39,422
What program is that?

931
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:41,091
The dogboy program.

932
00:52:41,124 --> 00:52:43,827
Captain brown will tell you all about it.

933
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,529
Show me the way.

934
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:58,108
( Grunting ) You think I'd forget, huh?

935
00:52:58,141 --> 00:53:00,076
You think I'd do nothing?

936
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:02,045
Ain't how it works, dogboy!

937
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:04,748
Gah!

938
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:09,986
Your friend Willy b.'S dog meat.

939
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:17,594
Maybe it's time you feed the dogs too, huh?

940
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:19,829
God.

941
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:33,376
Don't do it.

942
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:37,414
You do it,
you spend the rest of your life in here.

943
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:38,615
He ain't worth it.

944
00:53:38,648 --> 00:53:40,050
Come on, boy.

945
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:42,485
Put it down.

946
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:45,055
You kill him, he's gonna take

947
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:47,891
your life with him.

948
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:53,630
( Weight clatters ) All right, you two!

949
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:57,634
Get him over to the infirmary!

950
00:53:57,667 --> 00:54:00,970
Hey, top dog, you come with me.

951
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:04,007
I got a job for you.

952
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:09,646
We appreciate your support,
senator, and here's to you.

953
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:12,048
( Knocking ) I'll tell you right now,

954
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,651
it's getting harder and harder to come by.

955
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:16,486
What the hell's this, pappy?

956
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:17,587
Where's my top dog?

957
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:20,023
Well, he, uh, he injured himself.

958
00:54:20,056 --> 00:54:22,859
I sent him to the infirmary,
but I tell you, boss,

959
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:26,062
Taylor here,
he'll run as good a track as Miguel.

960
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:31,034
Well, if he doesn't, it's on your head.

961
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:34,637
Gentlemen, this here's our top dog today.

962
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:36,873
He's gonna lay the tracks we're gonna run.

963
00:54:36,906 --> 00:54:38,007
Don't look like much.

964
00:54:38,041 --> 00:54:41,044
Well, it's not the looking,
Mr. Cates, it's the doing.

965
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:42,212
This boy can run.

966
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:46,082
Just don't want to waste my
time with some gutless punk

967
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:49,119
gives it up before the dogs get near him.

968
00:54:49,152 --> 00:54:51,688
What you in for, boy?

969
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:56,025
Kicking the shit out of a big old redneck.

970
00:54:56,059 --> 00:55:00,096
If was running this place,
I'd stretch you down

971
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:03,233
and work the piss out
of you with a bullwhip.

972
00:55:03,266 --> 00:55:05,668
Then you'd be in on assault charges,

973
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:06,770
too, Mr. Cates.

974
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,571
Well, as I live and breathe.

975
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:10,707
How nice to see you again, miss dern.

976
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,876
You know warden Wakefield.

977
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:15,111
Gentlemen, this is Jennifer dern

978
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,112
from the d.A.'S office.

979
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:19,616
She's been investigating
an unfortunate accident

980
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,084
we had down at the dog unit.

981
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:23,720
You know, she's been... let me see, now.

982
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:27,557
It was St. Luke's fundraiser, wasn't it?

983
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:29,859
You have quite a memory, Mr. Diggs.

984
00:55:29,893 --> 00:55:30,960
Yes, ma'am.

985
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,061
How's your wife?

986
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,596
Why, she's just fine.

987
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:36,800
She's just as fine as frog's hair.

988
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,701
One big, happy family.

989
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:41,137
Mm.

990
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:44,040
I understand you're
running an exercise today.

991
00:55:44,073 --> 00:55:45,542
I'd like to ride along.

992
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:46,910
Oh, well, I don't know.

993
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:50,547
That's kind of an unusual request.

994
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:53,016
Any more unusual than for these gentlemen?

995
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:56,719
Well, I think miss dern
would be a welcome addition

996
00:55:56,753 --> 00:55:57,854
to our party.

997
00:55:57,887 --> 00:55:59,189
You betcha.

998
00:55:59,222 --> 00:56:02,525
Excuse me, warden, but there's gonna be

999
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,027
some hard riding.

1000
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:07,030
I doubt miss dern will be up to it.

1001
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:09,299
Well, I was raised on a ranch,
captain brown.

1002
00:56:09,332 --> 00:56:10,300
Don't worry about me.

1003
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:14,604
Well, now! It's all settled,
then, isn't it?

1004
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:17,073
I suppose it is.

1005
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:36,793
( Barking ) Looks like our query's

1006
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:43,266
gone to earth, gentlemen.

1007
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:45,134
Down the hatch!

1008
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:47,670
Goddamn,
it doesn't get much better than this.

1009
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:50,006
Got a mighty fine pack of dogs here,
captain brown.

1010
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:51,207
Maybe he's not in there.

1011
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,042
That pipe could go on for miles!

1012
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,878
Oh, he's in there, all right.

1013
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:57,247
Check it out, Mr. Wilkins.

1014
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,950
You in there, dogboy?

1015
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:02,252
Fair game. You got me.

1016
00:57:02,285 --> 00:57:04,754
Just call the dogs off,
and I'll come on out.

1017
00:57:04,787 --> 00:57:06,756
Shall I call them off, captain?

1018
00:57:06,789 --> 00:57:09,092
There's only one man
gives orders around here,

1019
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:11,694
Mr. Wilkins,
and it's not that scum in the pipe!

1020
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:14,964
You're to come on out!

1021
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:19,102
That's an order from cap brown, you hear?

1022
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:22,005
What's Clyde doing there?

1023
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,714
What is it?

1024
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:33,683
Manhole!

1025
00:57:33,716 --> 00:57:34,717
What do you see?

1026
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:35,718
I don't know.

1027
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:37,720
It's pretty dark down there.

1028
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:38,588
Wait a minute!

1029
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:40,823
There's a glimmer of light to the left.

1030
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:42,091
Well, that figures.

1031
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,092
What else?

1032
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,294
Nothing else! Yes!

1033
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:46,696
For Christ's sake, what is it?

1034
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:48,731
It's a metal grille,
and I guess that means...

1035
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:49,866
He's trapped.

1036
00:57:49,899 --> 00:57:52,936
( Chuckles ) Why don't you
send Clyde down after him?

1037
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,939
Teddy, we'll smoke the critter out.

1038
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:59,142
( Crackling ) He's trapped.

1039
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:06,282
Clyde'll take care of him.

1040
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,284
All right, warden, you've found your man.

1041
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:09,085
You've had your fun.

1042
00:58:09,118 --> 00:58:11,287
I think it's time we call it a day.

1043
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,289
I really should be getting back to town.

1044
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,291
Well, it's all a matter of discipline,
miss dern,

1045
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,436
but if you want to go back,
you just follow the river

1046
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,361
due south.

1047
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:20,430
We're just keeping
up an old tradition here,

1048
00:58:20,463 --> 00:58:22,432
smoking old foxy out of his hole.

1049
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:24,834
Well, it's also tradition
that the fox is always killed

1050
00:58:24,867 --> 00:58:26,169
and the youngest hunter blooded.

1051
00:58:26,202 --> 00:58:27,379
Is that what you have in mind?

1052
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:29,672
Because I don't want blood on my hands,
warden.

1053
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:30,673
That won't happen.

1054
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:32,675
That boy's gonna come to no harm.

1055
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:33,910
Now, come along, now.

1056
00:58:33,943 --> 00:58:35,345
Don't be an old spoil sport.

1057
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:38,147
( Julian coughing ) ( Barking )

1058
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:49,359
Aah! Aah!

1059
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:52,395
Get off!

1060
00:58:52,428 --> 00:58:54,998
Call him off!

1061
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,966
Aah!

1062
00:58:58,835 --> 00:58:59,802
Warden!

1063
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:02,338
All right, Bob, that's enough.

1064
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:06,876
She's getting all high in the behind here!

1065
00:59:06,909 --> 00:59:09,045
Damn it.

1066
00:59:09,078 --> 00:59:11,714
Whoa. Hold on, miss.

1067
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:13,950
( Fires ) Call him off,

1068
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:15,218
or I'll kill him!

1069
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:17,286
Release!

1070
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:20,923
( Groans, coughs ) You'd shoot my dog?

1071
00:59:26,996 --> 00:59:29,265
To save a man's life, yes.

1072
00:59:29,298 --> 00:59:31,467
And for your information,
I'm filing a full report

1073
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:33,770
of this incident to the district attorney

1074
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:35,004
first thing tomorrow morning.

1075
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:43,279
Captain brown,
why don't you head on in with the dogs

1076
00:59:43,312 --> 00:59:45,314
and show our guests a little hospitality?

1077
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:53,348
I'll, uh, I'll take care of things here.

1078
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:59,262
Thanks for speaking up.

1079
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,968
You're welcome.

1080
01:00:06,002 --> 01:00:07,837
Miss dern?

1081
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:13,276
You, uh, remount, we'll head on in.

1082
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:15,044
You all right, son?

1083
01:00:15,078 --> 01:00:17,914
Yes, sir.

1084
01:00:20,516 --> 01:00:23,052
( Dogs barking ) ( Knocking )

1085
01:00:33,896 --> 01:00:35,565
You're working late.

1086
01:00:35,598 --> 01:00:38,367
Something's going on at retrieve,
something bad.

1087
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:40,436
I'm getting out a report on it for the d.A.

1088
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,905
Make your hair stand on end.

1089
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:45,908
Can I get you a cup of coffee or something?

1090
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:47,977
No. Oh, hey.

1091
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:49,912
Come take a look at this.

1092
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:51,948
What is it?

1093
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:52,982
Where'd you get it?

1094
01:00:53,015 --> 01:00:54,984
Dogboy named Taylor gave it to me.

1095
01:00:55,017 --> 01:00:56,986
Snuck it to me on the sly, actually.

1096
01:00:57,019 --> 01:00:59,555
Taylor? Wasn't he the
one that will wanted...

1097
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:00,490
Yeah, he seems cool.

1098
01:01:00,523 --> 01:01:03,593
It's a picture of a man with his hands up.

1099
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:04,594
Looks kind of funny.

1100
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:05,761
Did you ask him?

1101
01:01:05,795 --> 01:01:09,165
I didn't get a chance,
but I will first thing tomorrow.

1102
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:11,200
I really think we've got something.

1103
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:13,870
Well, it's curious, but it wouldn't put

1104
01:01:13,903 --> 01:01:15,004
too much importance on it.

1105
01:01:15,037 --> 01:01:16,839
It's a chewed-up photo.

1106
01:01:22,578 --> 01:01:25,515
It's gotta be the key.

1107
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,501
What do you want?

1108
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:48,504
Please, sit down.

1109
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:58,080
Tell me about the picture.

1110
01:01:59,415 --> 01:02:01,584
What about it?

1111
01:02:01,617 --> 01:02:04,420
It's okay.

1112
01:02:04,453 --> 01:02:07,023
Did you find it on will?

1113
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:09,625
Sort of.

1114
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:12,528
It was in the cage where he was killed.

1115
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,997
Now, I gave you that picture,
lady, what the hell more

1116
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:16,999
do you want from me?

1117
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:22,405
But where did it come from?

1118
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:24,006
What does it mean?

1119
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,542
You had a cop in here, and he got killed.

1120
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,678
What the hell do you
think they're gonna do to me

1121
01:02:28,711 --> 01:02:30,046
if they think I'm part of it?

1122
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,014
If who thinks?

1123
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:34,684
I don't want to have
anything else to do with this.

1124
01:02:34,717 --> 01:02:37,153
No. Wait. Please.

1125
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:38,154
Will was my friend.

1126
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:39,155
He said he could trust you.

1127
01:02:39,188 --> 01:02:41,524
I don't know what you're talking about,
lady,

1128
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:43,125
and I can't help you.

1129
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:48,064
( Indistinct singing ) Taylor,
need a word with you.

1130
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:01,477
Hey!

1131
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:05,214
You're running in an hour.

1132
01:03:05,248 --> 01:03:06,949
Who's riding?

1133
01:03:06,983 --> 01:03:08,718
Me and Wilkins.

1134
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:10,720
Where's captain brown?

1135
01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:13,222
I don't know and I don't
care and neither should you.

1136
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:15,992
I got orders to set your
track and run it with Wilkins.

1137
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:18,961
You got orders to run the track.

1138
01:03:20,029 --> 01:03:22,198
I don't know why the hell you should care

1139
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:23,599
where cap brown is.

1140
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:26,569
I don't know when the hell
you're gonna learn to keep

1141
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:29,205
that mind of yours to yourself!

1142
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:33,743
Jesus. He's really got your ass tied up,
doesn't he?

1143
01:03:33,776 --> 01:03:37,380
Captain brown's got
everybody's ass tied up.

1144
01:03:37,413 --> 01:03:40,650
There ain't no shame in
being afraid of cap brown.

1145
01:03:40,683 --> 01:03:44,320
He is a frightening man.

1146
01:03:47,123 --> 01:03:49,625
You be on time.

1147
01:03:56,699 --> 01:03:59,635
So, did you get anything from your dogboy?

1148
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,537
Attitude. What'd you get?

1149
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:03,673
Oh, you owe me.

1150
01:04:03,706 --> 01:04:06,642
Retrieve's prisoner database
over the last five years.

1151
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:09,111
Inmate files and photos, too.

1152
01:04:09,145 --> 01:04:11,747
I had to practically promise
marriage to that 300-pound clerk

1153
01:04:11,781 --> 01:04:12,682
in records.

1154
01:04:12,715 --> 01:04:14,784
What, the pretty one with the nose ring?

1155
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:15,951
That's her.

1156
01:04:15,985 --> 01:04:19,055
Ooh. I'll get the office to
spring for a bridal shower.

1157
01:04:19,088 --> 01:04:21,791
Hey, by the way,
thanks for coming in on the weekend.

1158
01:04:21,824 --> 01:04:23,159
That's all right.

1159
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:26,329
I had some work to catch up on anyway.

1160
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:27,596
Management out now, pappy.

1161
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:28,597
Let's get going.

1162
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:30,099
I'll be right with you, boss.

1163
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:31,367
Hold on, boys.

1164
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,369
Wilkins, take the afternoon off.

1165
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:35,438
Pappy's going out with me and Clyde.

1166
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:36,806
Yes, sir, captain.

1167
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:37,807
Come on, pappy.

1168
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:41,344
Let's go track US a dogboy.

1169
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:44,513
When he says go, you go hot.

1170
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,315
Go on, and keep on going.

1171
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:47,717
Uhh!

1172
01:05:13,509 --> 01:05:15,311
What?

1173
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,416
Oh.

1174
01:05:44,673 --> 01:05:46,242
Come on.

1175
01:06:33,722 --> 01:06:36,125
Oh...

1176
01:06:56,245 --> 01:06:57,513
Good boy, Clyde.

1177
01:06:57,546 --> 01:06:58,914
Chased him up a tree.

1178
01:06:58,948 --> 01:07:01,350
What's he doing in this area,
pappy? Doesn't he know

1179
01:07:01,383 --> 01:07:02,785
that we don't run the northwest?

1180
01:07:02,818 --> 01:07:05,287
Yes, sir, boss. He knows.

1181
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:08,691
He does? Why, did you tell him, pappy?

1182
01:07:08,724 --> 01:07:10,693
I tell them all.

1183
01:07:10,726 --> 01:07:12,728
I told this one right off.

1184
01:07:12,761 --> 01:07:14,830
You don't run there.

1185
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:16,832
He must be lost.

1186
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:20,703
Then let's find him, Clyde.

1187
01:07:20,736 --> 01:07:22,771
Track!

1188
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:56,906
Holy shit.

1189
01:08:38,814 --> 01:08:44,386
( Barking ) You screwed up, boy.

1190
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:45,521
You broke track.

1191
01:08:45,554 --> 01:08:47,590
Disobedience will bring you pain.

1192
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:49,758
Time to pay the Piper.

1193
01:08:51,093 --> 01:08:55,064
Boss, don't do it.

1194
01:08:55,097 --> 01:08:57,399
Pappy, what do you think I'm gonna do?

1195
01:08:57,433 --> 01:08:59,802
You think I'm gonna shoot this dogboy?

1196
01:08:59,835 --> 01:09:02,071
I don't know, boss.

1197
01:09:02,104 --> 01:09:05,074
( Chuckles ) And what are you gonna do?

1198
01:09:05,107 --> 01:09:07,543
Are you gonna shoot me, pappy?

1199
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:10,879
Boss, too many people have died already.

1200
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:13,482
You said it was gonna stop.

1201
01:09:13,515 --> 01:09:14,883
People? You call them people?

1202
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:16,885
Scum, pappy, that's what they are.

1203
01:09:16,919 --> 01:09:20,990
That's why you had
to pull the pin on Willy.

1204
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:24,693
The world's a better place without scum.

1205
01:09:24,727 --> 01:09:26,962
You said it was gonna stop.

1206
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:29,365
It is gonna stop, and there isn't gonna be

1207
01:09:29,398 --> 01:09:31,667
any shooting, is there, pappy,
but what are we gonna do

1208
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:32,835
about this here dogboy?

1209
01:09:32,868 --> 01:09:34,803
Shoot him, pappy, shoot him!

1210
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:36,839
For Christ's sake, what's going on, pappy?

1211
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:38,841
You gonna take orders from a dogboy?

1212
01:09:38,874 --> 01:09:40,843
I-I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1213
01:09:40,876 --> 01:09:43,712
Boss,
maybe it's best you put that gun down.

1214
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:45,714
What do you think, Clyde?

1215
01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:50,853
( Barks ) No, boss!

1216
01:09:50,886 --> 01:09:52,454
Jesus!

1217
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:54,890
Dumb shit.

1218
01:09:54,923 --> 01:09:58,994
You are definitely fucking
up my little world, Tyler,

1219
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:01,897
and I don't like it.

1220
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:22,618
I finished up. I'm gonna go.

1221
01:10:22,651 --> 01:10:29,725
Hey, come in here for a minute.

1222
01:10:29,758 --> 01:10:30,859
Did you find something?

1223
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:32,161
Yeah, check this out.

1224
01:10:32,194 --> 01:10:33,896
I found this guy.

1225
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:35,030
His name's Walker.

1226
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:36,765
He was killed trying to escape.

1227
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:39,768
Really? Did you find anything else?

1228
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:41,770
Six out of eight attempted escapees

1229
01:10:41,804 --> 01:10:43,772
in the past year have ended up dead.

1230
01:10:43,806 --> 01:10:44,740
Is there a common factor?

1231
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:47,042
None of the dead ones have any next of kin,

1232
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:48,911
nobody to ask questions.

1233
01:10:48,944 --> 01:10:50,913
What does that have to do with brown?

1234
01:10:50,946 --> 01:10:52,014
It could be a coincidence.

1235
01:10:52,047 --> 01:10:53,925
Everything that goes on in
that prison has something

1236
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:55,017
to do with brown.

1237
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:56,928
What does any of this
have to do with tax evasion?

1238
01:10:56,952 --> 01:10:58,921
Stay focused on the big picture, here, Jen.

1239
01:10:58,954 --> 01:11:01,423
The big picture?!

1240
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:04,526
I swear, ewing,
if I hadn't been there on that ride-along,

1241
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:05,761
they would've killed Taylor.

1242
01:11:05,794 --> 01:11:06,762
You weren't there.

1243
01:11:06,795 --> 01:11:09,164
This guy's a psychopath!

1244
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:11,800
I have to go.

1245
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:14,970
I'll, uh, see you Monday.

1246
01:12:13,095 --> 01:12:14,830
Oh, my god.

1247
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:17,166
They're hunting them.

1248
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:44,793
Glad you could make
it on such short notice.

1249
01:12:44,827 --> 01:12:52,827
Hell, I'd drop anything to hunt.

1250
01:12:54,870 --> 01:13:02,870
Hell, I'd drop anything to hunt.

1251
01:13:16,859 --> 01:13:20,229
You got 15 minutes.

1252
01:13:37,045 --> 01:13:39,815
I've given him 15 minutes.

1253
01:13:39,848 --> 01:13:42,084
Let's make it ten.

1254
01:13:49,191 --> 01:13:51,693
( Panting ) Track!

1255
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:47,049
Okay, let's have a look at the cards now!

1256
01:14:47,082 --> 01:14:50,352
Oh, oh ho! Dawn,
I'm afraid you lose. It's your turn.

1257
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:53,889
She's the first one,
first one gonna show US...

1258
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:56,024
Oh ho! Yeah!

1259
01:14:56,058 --> 01:14:57,392
Brrrr!

1260
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:02,431
Warden! We've gotta get
to the dog unit right now.

1261
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:04,232
Um! Well, now, hold on.

1262
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:12,266
Just let me call down there,
see what's happening.

1263
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:15,677
Ahem. Yeah, this... this is the warden.

1264
01:15:15,711 --> 01:15:18,447
Give me a situation report,
and make it real quick.

1265
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:19,448
Who's dealing?

1266
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:20,449
Cheers!

1267
01:15:20,482 --> 01:15:22,184
Dealing to the left?

1268
01:15:22,217 --> 01:15:24,052
Okay!

1269
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:26,054
Yeah. Yeah, right.

1270
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:28,056
There's no reason to go over there.

1271
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:30,459
We got one man in the infirmary,
we got two working chores,

1272
01:15:30,492 --> 01:15:32,861
and we got one running
a track with captain brown

1273
01:15:32,894 --> 01:15:34,196
over in the northwest quadrant.

1274
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:35,864
Who's running the track?

1275
01:15:35,897 --> 01:15:36,865
Taylor.

1276
01:15:36,898 --> 01:15:37,733
He fits the profile.

1277
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:39,935
No next of kin, nobody to look for him.

1278
01:15:39,968 --> 01:15:42,113
We've gotta find that boy
before they kill him, warden.

1279
01:15:42,137 --> 01:15:44,106
Kill him? What the hell
are you talking about?

1280
01:15:44,139 --> 01:15:45,741
I'll tell you on the way.

1281
01:15:45,774 --> 01:15:47,809
Yeah, well, just keep playing, girls.

1282
01:15:47,843 --> 01:15:49,811
I want to see, uh, want to see a loser

1283
01:15:49,845 --> 01:15:51,246
when I get back.

1284
01:15:52,414 --> 01:15:54,716
You can't tell a damn
thing from that photo.

1285
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:55,751
It could mean anything!

1286
01:15:55,784 --> 01:15:57,986
Well,
how is it that a third of the men who try

1287
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:00,288
to escape die,
and when the ratio of killing went up,

1288
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:02,991
brown began depositing
money in offshore banks?

1289
01:16:03,025 --> 01:16:04,192
Damn it! My battery's dead.

1290
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:05,227
Can I borrow yours?

1291
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:06,028
Doesn't work.

1292
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:08,230
I've been meaning to have it fixed.

1293
01:16:08,263 --> 01:16:09,131
What?

1294
01:16:09,164 --> 01:16:11,266
Goddamn it, I told you it doesn't work!

1295
01:16:11,299 --> 01:16:12,267
Oh, my god!

1296
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:14,269
( Grunting ) ( Screaming )

1297
01:16:14,302 --> 01:16:18,507
( Spraying ) Aah! Aah!

1298
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:22,411
You bitch! You bitch!

1299
01:16:30,118 --> 01:16:33,989
( Panting, coughing) ( Footsteps )

1300
01:16:45,834 --> 01:16:46,802
Uhh!

1301
01:16:46,835 --> 01:16:48,537
Oh!

1302
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:50,539
What the hell are you doing here?

1303
01:16:50,572 --> 01:16:51,540
I was looking for you!

1304
01:16:51,573 --> 01:16:52,474
I know what's going on.

1305
01:16:52,507 --> 01:16:54,543
They're hunting people
out here like animals.

1306
01:16:54,576 --> 01:16:57,145
Well, gee, now we both know.

1307
01:16:57,179 --> 01:16:58,380
Wakefield's in on it, too.

1308
01:16:58,413 --> 01:17:00,148
I just got away from him.

1309
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:01,016
Shit.

1310
01:17:01,049 --> 01:17:03,151
( Dog barking ) Okay, we gotta get

1311
01:17:03,185 --> 01:17:04,152
over the fence.

1312
01:17:04,186 --> 01:17:05,287
It's our only chance.

1313
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,222
The closest one is northwest.

1314
01:17:07,255 --> 01:17:11,560
Let's go! You're being hunted, now, too.

1315
01:17:11,593 --> 01:17:12,561
Ow!

1316
01:17:12,594 --> 01:17:13,862
You okay?

1317
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:14,963
Yeah.

1318
01:17:14,996 --> 01:17:17,265
What the hell are you
carrying in your hand, anyway?

1319
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:19,034
Mace.

1320
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:23,105
How do you think
they'll like our scent now?

1321
01:17:23,138 --> 01:17:24,439
They're gonna love it.

1322
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:25,807
Come on!

1323
01:17:39,554 --> 01:17:41,490
( Whining ) What in the hell's

1324
01:17:47,629 --> 01:17:48,897
Going on now?

1325
01:17:53,602 --> 01:17:55,370
Ack!

1326
01:17:58,306 --> 01:18:01,409
He's got company, female company.

1327
01:18:01,443 --> 01:18:03,078
Oh, yeah?

1328
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:07,215
And who the hell do you think
he's eloping with, that nurse?

1329
01:18:07,249 --> 01:18:10,085
Had to guess,
I'd say it was that dern bitch.

1330
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:12,354
Am I hearing you right?

1331
01:18:12,387 --> 01:18:15,423
She's been hanging around like a bad smell.

1332
01:18:15,457 --> 01:18:19,027
Well, now, cap, we're in deep shit.

1333
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:20,195
I'm outta here.

1334
01:18:21,396 --> 01:18:22,597
Hey, quit worrying.

1335
01:18:22,631 --> 01:18:25,000
You get two for the price of one.

1336
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:25,934
You'll owe me.

1337
01:18:25,967 --> 01:18:28,003
Well, that dumb dog of yours is gonna need

1338
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:30,105
a firecracker up his ass.

1339
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:35,544
And who's gonna light the fuse, you?

1340
01:18:35,577 --> 01:18:37,179
Come on.

1341
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:40,048
Clyde's picked up the trail again.

1342
01:18:40,081 --> 01:18:41,383
Let's go.

1343
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:42,984
Come on!

1344
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:51,560
You're gonna stick by
me when we're out of this?

1345
01:18:51,593 --> 01:18:53,361
Hey, you're my only witness.

1346
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:56,131
Yeah, but are they gonna believe me, a con,

1347
01:18:56,164 --> 01:18:58,633
going against state senators and all? A con

1348
01:18:58,667 --> 01:18:59,968
and a senator's daughter.

1349
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:01,303
You're a senator's daughter?

1350
01:19:01,336 --> 01:19:02,304
There it is.

1351
01:19:02,337 --> 01:19:03,638
Yeah, come on.

1352
01:19:09,477 --> 01:19:11,580
There's no way I'm gonna make it over that.

1353
01:19:11,613 --> 01:19:12,581
You go ahead.

1354
01:19:12,614 --> 01:19:13,582
No, no way!

1355
01:19:13,615 --> 01:19:15,150
Come on, we'll make it together.

1356
01:19:15,183 --> 01:19:18,186
Come on! Uhh! Come on!

1357
01:19:20,989 --> 01:19:22,424
Come on!

1358
01:19:22,457 --> 01:19:24,926
( Barking ) You hear that?

1359
01:19:35,737 --> 01:19:38,607
He's saying we're getting close.

1360
01:20:07,769 --> 01:20:11,640
Well,
this is one hell of a lousy deal, cap.

1361
01:20:11,673 --> 01:20:14,342
The birds have flown, and not even

1362
01:20:14,376 --> 01:20:17,579
a single lousy potshot.

1363
01:20:17,612 --> 01:20:20,148
No one's ever made the wire before.

1364
01:20:20,181 --> 01:20:24,085
Well, I guess I'd better get my money back

1365
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:26,488
before we have company.

1366
01:20:26,521 --> 01:20:29,758
( Chuckles ) My whole world's fallen apart.

1367
01:20:29,791 --> 01:20:33,228
You want your money back?

1368
01:20:33,261 --> 01:20:34,562
Don't fuck with me, bro.

1369
01:20:34,596 --> 01:20:36,364
I got too much on you.

1370
01:20:36,398 --> 01:20:38,133
You arrogant prick.

1371
01:20:39,467 --> 01:20:40,578
You're in this as deep as I am.

1372
01:20:40,602 --> 01:20:43,371
You're gonna help me out,
or you're going down with me.

1373
01:20:43,405 --> 01:20:47,108
Oh. And who are they gonna believe,
a respected

1374
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:50,412
pillar of society, or a fucked-up cop

1375
01:20:50,445 --> 01:20:53,315
with a reputation for killing cons?

1376
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:56,351
Oh, you might've got away
with it back in Australia, just.

1377
01:20:56,384 --> 01:21:04,384
Here, you won't be so lucky, I guarantee.

1378
01:21:06,428 --> 01:21:14,428
Here, you won't be so lucky, I guarantee.

1379
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:32,821
Okay, Clyde, let's go get our meal ticket.

1380
01:21:32,854 --> 01:21:40,854
You and me are going on a long vacation.

1381
01:21:43,098 --> 01:21:51,098
You and me are going on a long vacation.

1382
01:22:02,317 --> 01:22:06,121
Now who's tracking who, boss?

1383
01:22:06,154 --> 01:22:08,857
This what you're looking for, captain?

1384
01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:11,860
You should've gone over
the fence when you had

1385
01:22:11,893 --> 01:22:13,261
the chance, dogboy.

1386
01:22:13,294 --> 01:22:14,796
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1387
01:22:14,829 --> 01:22:17,732
I wanna be here when they
drive you back from diagnostic.

1388
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:20,268
Some boys in the tank
are gonna be real interested

1389
01:22:20,301 --> 01:22:22,404
seeing you come in.

1390
01:22:22,437 --> 01:22:24,339
Stand up.

1391
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:31,112
Put your hands behind your back.

1392
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:41,723
Uhh!

1393
01:22:41,756 --> 01:22:45,894
Now, you drop that, or I'll break her neck.

1394
01:22:45,927 --> 01:22:47,362
Let her go.

1395
01:22:47,395 --> 01:22:48,496
Stop it, you stupid bitch.

1396
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:50,498
I'll kill her, Taylor, I mean it.

1397
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:51,566
All right, all right.

1398
01:22:51,599 --> 01:22:53,501
Calm down.

1399
01:22:53,535 --> 01:22:55,403
Now, slide it over here.

1400
01:22:59,874 --> 01:23:06,714
Now, turn around and put
your hands behind your head.

1401
01:23:06,748 --> 01:23:08,616
Uhh!

1402
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:10,785
Leave it right there, brown.

1403
01:23:12,687 --> 01:23:16,391
What the hell are you doing, Adam?

1404
01:23:16,424 --> 01:23:24,424
Why don't you just, uh,
keep the little lady company?

1405
01:23:26,468 --> 01:23:34,468
Why don't you just, uh,
keep the little lady company?

1406
01:23:51,626 --> 01:23:53,595
Well...

1407
01:23:53,628 --> 01:23:56,564
You didn't tell me you
were keeping records.

1408
01:23:56,598 --> 01:24:00,702
It was insurance for both of US.

1409
01:24:00,735 --> 01:24:02,403
Insurance, my ass.

1410
01:24:02,437 --> 01:24:05,707
You were gonna take off with these,
and then what,

1411
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:09,844
blackmail US good citizens
from some safe haven?

1412
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:13,314
Well, that could work for me, too.

1413
01:24:13,348 --> 01:24:14,616
Kill. What?

1414
01:24:14,649 --> 01:24:16,651
I said kill!

1415
01:24:16,684 --> 01:24:18,820
Aah!

1416
01:24:19,921 --> 01:24:22,524
Back off!

1417
01:24:22,557 --> 01:24:25,260
You shot my dog.

1418
01:24:25,293 --> 01:24:26,528
( Screams ) Over there.

1419
01:24:57,525 --> 01:25:05,525
You can be part of Clyde's funeral pyre.

1420
01:25:07,569 --> 01:25:14,776
You can be part of Clyde's funeral pyre.

1421
01:25:14,809 --> 01:25:17,645
( Grunting, banging ) It's locked!

1422
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:19,480
Grab Wakefield's gun!

1423
01:25:27,055 --> 01:25:28,056
Okay, move!

1424
01:25:28,089 --> 01:25:29,657
I'm gonna blast the lock!

1425
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:42,963
( Rifle discharges ) ( Neighs )

1426
01:25:43,838 --> 01:25:45,006
Uhh!

1427
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:48,343
( Barking ) God!

1428
01:25:48,376 --> 01:25:49,344
You all right?

1429
01:25:49,377 --> 01:25:50,945
Yes!

1430
01:25:50,979 --> 01:25:53,414
Here.

1431
01:25:53,448 --> 01:25:54,949
Shit! No keys.

1432
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:56,951
They must still be on the warden.

1433
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:58,820
Don't even think about it!

1434
01:25:58,853 --> 01:26:01,756
If he makes it to the fence, he's gone!

1435
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:04,025
Yeah, ewing, it's me.

1436
01:26:04,058 --> 01:26:05,627
I'm at retrieve.

1437
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:07,895
I'm in the northwest quadrant with Taylor.

1438
01:26:07,929 --> 01:26:08,896
I need backup now!

1439
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:10,398
We got a man down and a fire.

1440
01:26:10,431 --> 01:26:11,899
Got it, boys, huh?

1441
01:26:11,933 --> 01:26:14,969
Got the scent? Track! Track!

1442
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:16,938
Taylor! Shit.

1443
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:46,467
Ha! Ow! Ha!

1444
01:26:49,003 --> 01:26:52,073
Aah! Get off! Go!

1445
01:26:52,106 --> 01:26:53,741
Get off me!

1446
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:58,813
Down! Ha!

1447
01:26:58,846 --> 01:27:02,483
( Screaming ) Release!

1448
01:27:05,787 --> 01:27:07,922
Release!

1449
01:27:42,957 --> 01:27:44,726
Are you all right?

1450
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:47,095
Yeah.

1451
01:27:49,063 --> 01:27:56,204
So, you think you can get me off?

1452
01:27:56,237 --> 01:27:59,073
For good behavior?

1453
01:27:59,107 --> 01:28:02,210
( Siren wailing ) ( Laughs )

1454
01:28:02,243 --> 01:28:05,813
You know...

1455
01:28:05,847 --> 01:28:08,149
Hey, what are friends for?
