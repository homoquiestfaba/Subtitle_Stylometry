Yeah, I got it.

374
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,400
We're good.

375
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:30,199
This is home for the night.

376
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,332
Should be everything you need
right here waiting on you.

377
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:35,366
Thank you.

00:26:35,367 --> 00:26:36,932
You all have fun?

379
00:26:36,933 --> 00:26:37,767
Yes.

380
00:26:37,768 --> 00:26:38,832
That was cool.

381
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:41,066
It's sure been a pleasure.

382
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:42,067

00:26:42,068 --> 00:26:43,933

watch yourselves out here.

A lot of hogs, gators, snakes,

387
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,366
and a few two-legged vermin
running around here too.

388
00:26:55,367 --> 00:26:56,466
Y'all take care.

389
00:26:56,467 --> 00:26:58,066

I think you should find out.

00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:19,099
you got a cowboy by your side,

This is pretty cool.

I mean, I feel really connected.

what I'm talking about.

None of that really
matters out here.

a whole other world.

Ange, you guys were so
young when you got married.

428
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,432
I mean, you can't
really know what

429
00:29:31,433 --> 00:29:33,699
you want out of
life at that age.

430
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,099
Yeah Ange, I mean,

431
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,700
you both were going in different
directions, that's all.

432
00:29:40,067 --> 00:29:43,732
Maybe that's what this
whole survival thing is about.

to prove to yourself.

He never let me take the shot.

You know, I could always
track better than any guy.

439
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,699
So, I'd always take
the position to track.

440
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,699
You know, I'd put them
in position, and then

441
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,133
he always took the damn shot.

442
00:30:10,367 --> 00:30:11,932
You know what the
worst part was?

443
00:30:11,933 --> 00:30:13,299
It's always yours.

444
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,800
You just let them.

445
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,167
So, all your hunting,

446
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,432
you never really shot anything?

able to kill anything.

Oh, me either.

Hey, all I was asking is

453
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:36,899
whether we'd keep getting
together for our trips.

never drift apart.
