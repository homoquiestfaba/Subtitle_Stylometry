1
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:16,316
Listen, if you really believe your father
 testified, what a powerful mother

2
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:19,786
would your father of sanctions work
 and planning to run for attorney general.

3
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,889
What about the bomb threat?
 You really take this seriously.

4
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:24,057
We've never been more severe.

5
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:25,825
You said you're going
 to focus more on crime.

6
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:28,094
This kills more people
 than all crimes put together.

7
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:31,531
Are they related to a case
 for a terrorist attack? For protection?

8
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:33,700
We're moving the case
 to a university location.

9
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:36,736
If they are bomb threats, then doesn't
 that prove that this case is ridiculous?

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,140
If they are related,
 it shows how volatile this issue is.

11
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:43,043
Homeland Security University
 had the trial, too.

12
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:48,415
What a waste of taxpayers money, huh? Huh?

13
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:50,550
They should spend it
 to put us in a better place.

14
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,319
I meant the trial. What do you do?

15
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:56,856
Hardware store. And you?

16
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,993
I published women's magazines.

17
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:01,361
Publishing, huh?

18
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,663
Hey, my son is writing a novel.

19
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,599
Did you read The Post today?

20
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,802
I supposed to read.
 I watched the local news.

21
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:11,004
It was on the bus flying.

22
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,840
I just read the headline, what it say.

23
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:20,480
It said, Everyone's calling
 for Sheila Morgan's resignation. Why?

24
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,384
Because this trial was an outrageous abuse

25
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:28,421
of power, particularly when there are more
 important things to do.

26
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,757
He said all that in the headline.

27
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,892
This has been interesting.

28
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:36,096
I mean, the issues.

29
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:39,833
Did you? Yes. I didn't hear any issues.

30
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,769
You know, they went with me
 to the bathroom.

31
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,071
They're very helpful.

32
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:49,042
I just think they thought
 I was going to escape.

33
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:52,245
Yeah. Have you ever done this before me?

34
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,881
No. Oh, nothing to worry about.

35
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,584
Use that to keep things on track,
 that's all. I don't have your full name.

36
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,353
Mona. Mona Bradley.

37
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:03,723
Have you done this before? A few times.

38
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,926
Maybe you should be performing.

39
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,394
They voted for you, Mr. Ansen.

40
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:10,396
I don't know why.

41
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:12,966
So should I begin?

42
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,801
Is everybody here?

43
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:19,305
Yes. Go ahead, stop.

44
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:23,276
If everyone could take
 their seats, please.

45
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:28,448
Miss Ingram, if you could. Sorry.

46
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:36,756
Since I am the foreman for person,

47
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:40,627
for person, right,

48
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:43,830
well, I've never done this before,
 so open it up for discussion.

49
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,133
I'm going to open it up for discussion.
 Well, there's nothing to discuss.

50
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:48,434
Why don't we all take a vote?

51
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,970
We all go the same way
 that we can get out of here.

52
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,008
Well, but Miss Wang here
 believes that a discussion is in order.

53
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:58,845
You're the foreman. Not Wang.

54
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:04,150
A discussion is usually the first thing,

55
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:08,588
you know, a vote now
 might make things simpler. What do you do?

56
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:10,823
I'm a scientist.

57
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:13,259
I teach at Columbia.

58
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,629
Oh, well, I guess a vote would be OK.

59
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:20,533
All right. Well,
 does anyone have any objections?

60
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:27,373
What are we voting on whether to acquit
 or convict? Eleanor Jordan?

61
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:33,213
Well, you've been right here in the moment
 and you OK, everyone.

62
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,517
We've been asked to decide
 if Eleanor Jordan is guilty

63
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,719
of one of the three crimes
 described to us.

64
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:44,624
Well, shouldn't we vote on each one
 separately, separately?

65
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,293
We can still take a general vote that way.

66
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:48,595
We can see what we're up against.

67
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:51,231
Maybe there'll be nothing to discuss
 like this guy says,

68
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,399
we can get the hell out of here.

69
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,970
Are we inclined to acquit Eleanor Jordan

70
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,139
of the three crimes
 of which she's been accused? Can we

71
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,676
go over each crime? Sure. Yeah.

72
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:08,748
Simon on line one. Oh, good luck.

73
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:15,021
So how many pages of your read

74
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:20,426
has been read it and. Yeah.

75
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,464
No, no, no. I think I can actually get Joe
 to write a book about that.

76
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:31,070
But I know this. No, no, no.

77
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:35,775
Did you read the editorial
 in The Times this morning? It has.

78
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:44,484
Yeah. Well, listen, let me

79
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,487
let me call you out there
 over the weekend.

80
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,256
All right. Good.

81
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,862
So shall we go? I got to be back
 by one o'clock. OK.

82
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,231
You sounded better today.

83
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:00,900
That's not how he sounded to me.

84
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,270
Always the pessimist, always in denial.

85
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:09,475
Thanks. Don't thank me, I'm
 just telling you the truth, your truth.

86
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,313
I'm just going to go
 see him myself. Oh, no, Jack.

87
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,749
I'm sorry. Please.

88
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:19,185
Let's just let's not fight.

89
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,954
We're not fighting, we're just

90
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:23,790
in separate worlds.

91
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,825
Well, can't we do this together?

92
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,461
It's a bit late, so crucify me.

93
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,931
Thanks for the article.

94
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,666
Will you even read it?

95
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,969
I you've dismissed me my whole life.

96
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,705
And there's the evidence.

97
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:41,207
Look at it. Breathe it,

98
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,643
do whatever you want.

99
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:57,023
All I got to. Crop.

100
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,217
Miss Bradley, I guess, will do you first.

101
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,619
What do you think? I think I'm hungry.

102
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:29,389
I don't think it was any coffee and donuts
 at least, or something.

103
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,991
I am dying for a cappuccino.
 Caffeine addict.

104
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,226
Let's prosecute.

105
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,528
She's a die for one, not killed for it.

106
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:39,599
How do you vote? Acquittal.

107
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,934
Mr. Cassidy? You know where I stand.

108
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,670
It was that little. Of course, ma'am.

109
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,374
I mean, not certain, sir.

110
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,109
I'm from acquittal.

111
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,645
Acquittal? Yeah. Acquittal.

112
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:56,549
Mr. Murphy. What the hell
 do you think? Eloquent.

113
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,051
Are you voting? Acquittal.

114
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,554
You bet you Miss Ingram.

115
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:05,591
I'm not certain,
 but I'm inclined to convict her.

116
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,261
You're not serious?

117
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,330
Yeah, I have some doubts. Oh, come on.

118
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:12,799
Can we continue?

119
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,468
Hey, who's the foreman? Mr. Jeffries?

120
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:22,642
Well, I would be inclined to acquit
 Eleanor Jordan, but

121
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:26,078
I would not mind talking

122
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,581
griddle. Acquittal.

123
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:35,188
OK. And how do you vote me?

124
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:39,225
Oh, well, I wish I vote for acquittal.

125
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:44,330
Miss Diego, have you
 if you decided, ma'am.

126
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,299
I guess I had a quota.

127
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,334
That's good, as in good girl.

128
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:52,572
As in as in 11 votes for an acquittal

129
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,774
and only one for a conviction.

130
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,544
Well, now what do we do?

131
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:02,448
Well, now we get to convince her
 to change her vote.

132
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:05,051
So why are you so inclined to convict?

133
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,686
Can't believe Elmau joins a criminal.

134
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:13,493
Maybe, Professor Rimbaud, you teach it in
 courses. Oh, yeah. Yes.

135
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,496
I teach the ethics of science
 at the Massachusetts

136
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,498
Institute of Technology at MIT.

137
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:22,168
Yes. My focus is on the scientific method.

138
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:28,040
I've analyzed the methods used to arrive
 at scientific conclusions.

139
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:31,844
How would you explain
 to your students at M.I.T.

140
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,379
what this trial is about?

141
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,480
Objection, your honor.

142
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,516
As Mr. Ranneberger lawyer,

143
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,552
does your honor wish him to be defining
 what this trial is about?

144
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:43,389
Miss Morgan, I have faith in the jury
 to decide what this trial is about

145
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:47,727
with my guidance, of course.

146
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:50,630
Overruled. Let's
 get on with this, Mr. Peterson.

147
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,632
You may continue, Mr..

148
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:53,533
Excuse me, doctor.

149
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,402
Remember? Actually, I prefer Mr. Sherman.

150
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,605
One could reasonably argue

151
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:03,409
that the scientific method
 is on trial here, along with a defendant,

152
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:09,282
because if we put aside for a moment
 the emotions that surround

153
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:12,785
death and disease
 and our feelings about tobacco,

154
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,522
then it really all
 comes down to just one question.

155
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:23,195
Can science prove a causal connection
 between the defendant's use of cigarets

156
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,665
and the subsequent death
 of her husband from cancer?

157
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,239
Now, these Jackley.

158
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,310
Would you go get mommy smores,

159
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,079
Eve, you're going to be here. Thank you.

160
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:50,289
Jack? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
 that's not everybody, I don't think.

161
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,758
Take it easy. It's fine, Jack.

162
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,093
Give me the camera, buddy.

163
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:54,560
I mean, you can.

164
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,462
All right. Come on.
 Stay with your mother now.

165
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,297
Don't just stand with your mother.

166
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:01,400
All right. It might be nice to be a nice,
 friendly family.

167
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,704
All right. You're on the air
 around your mom.

168
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,973
Come on. A little kiss, huh?

169
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:10,042
There you go. Excellent. Excellent.

170
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:15,881
Good. Scientists conduct experiments.

171
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:20,019
But but in the end, all they can achieve
 is a set of probabilities.

172
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:23,022
Certainty is very, very rare in science.

173
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,192
Not that you would know that
 from listening to the scientists.

174
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:27,226
Why don't you push up?

175
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,264
Why did you push him?

176
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,468
Please. If it was an act of love.

177
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,513
OK, if Eleanor Jordan's

178
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:50,549
husband could talk, do you really think
 he'd wants to put his wife in prison?

179
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,584
Well, I don't think Mr.

180
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:54,320
Jordan's opinions
 or loyalties are relevant. Right.

181
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,256
OK, so we should review the elements.

182
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,458
We should review the elements.

183
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:02,495
Was the first crime
 again? Murder in the second degree.

184
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,463
Now, give me a break.

185
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,899
Can someone define elements, please?

186
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,734
Parts of the crimes.

187
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:11,337
Each part must be there
 for the crime to have been committed.

188
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:14,006
And if only one part is missing,
 there is no crime.

189
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,246
Mr. Rahmberg, can you give the court
 a simple example of the scientific

190
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:24,216
method properly used to find
 a certain result? Yes, of course.

191
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,753
Hold a tennis ball in your hand

192
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:30,322
a few feet off the floor and drop it.

193
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:32,758
The results are certain.

194
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:34,994
And we observe that
 the tennis ball bounces

195
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,830
and that it does so in strict accordance
 with the laws of physics.

196
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:40,666
I'm glad you mentioned
 physics, Mr. Rahmberg.

197
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,568
Are you aware of the
 laws of quantum mechanics?

198
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,173
Specific jurors believe particles
 and objects can appear in more

199
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:50,576
than one location, and we can only observe
 a particular location

200
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:53,612
because of the high probability
 that that locations where it would be.

201
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:55,815
Yes, it's the Heisenberg
 Uncertainty Principle. Yes.

202
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:58,184
It's fascinating stuff. Yes.

203
00:11:58,184 --> 00:11:59,251
And if this is true, Mr.

204
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:03,089
Rahmberg, when you dropped the tennis
 ball, we can only observe the location

205
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,357
of that tennis ball
 to comply with the laws of physics

206
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:06,392
you mentioned only because

207
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,295
of the high probability
 that such laws would be complied with.

208
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:10,963
Yes, that's true.

209
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:15,167
A man raises a gun and fires it
 into the chest of another human.

210
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:17,737
You see a Mr. Rahmberg, you observe it.

211
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,805
The victim dies instantly.

212
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,474
The laws of physics and biology

213
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,810
would tell us all that the victim dies
 as a direct cause of the bullet.

214
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:28,981
Yes. Well, if we follow your line
 of reasoning, then

215
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:33,052
then we cannot conclude that the victim
 died as a result of the gunshot wound.

216
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,122
But you see, you
 are you're stretching the limits

217
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:39,558
of science as as applied
 to what we call common sense.

218
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,027
I take that to mean, Mr.

219
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:46,432
Rahmberg, that quite possibly science
 has its limits in our halls of justice,

220
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:50,336
that if we strictly apply our scientific
 method to our justice system,

221
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:54,140
we can never conclude that
 any individual committed a crime. Yes.

222
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:58,277
But again, science should be used properly

223
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:01,814
as a framework for our common sense.

224
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:07,186
And it's up to our jury here
 to exercise that common sense, Mr.

225
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:11,791
Rahmberg being informed by science,
 by the facts, by the testimonies

226
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,728
and notions of fairness
 that this trial will lead to justice.

227
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:19,598
Yes, exactly. No further questions.

228
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,806
It is a stretch.

229
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,574
Think of the pollution cases.

230
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:31,644
There's precedents
 for conviction of business executives

231
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,346
when they pollute a river
 with consequences.

232
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,416
Of illness and death.

233
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:38,751
But it's not the same.

234
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,019
A hundred years ago,

235
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,788
dumping chemicals in a river
 would never be considered a crime.

236
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,890
Politically, it would be unacceptable.

237
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,159
Maybe I'm ahead of the

238
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,829
public in this one, Jack,
 but I'll risk it.

239
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,699
You know, you look bad
 if you win, you look bad

240
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:57,136
if you lose two.

241
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:02,007
A person is guilty of murder

242
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,944
in the second degree. If.

243
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:12,551
Under circumstances showing a depraved
 indifference to human life,

244
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:18,891
he or she recklessly engages
 in such conduct as to create

245
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:22,595
a grave risk of death for another person

246
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:28,400
and which results
 in the death of such person.

247
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:35,441
If that's what I'm for,

248
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,476
so you can just point.

249
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:45,117
We got to go. The only one who can
 write this book, so don't even go there.

250
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:49,455
All right. Go, go down.

251
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,964
Just tell me. Not throwing up
 from that chemo again.

252
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:05,604
She blew smoke in his face.

253
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:09,675
She certainly engaged in an activity
 that created a risk like drunk drivers.

254
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,477
Everything in life creates a risk.

255
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,880
Well, what does reconciling age
 really mean if one is aware of

256
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,450
and consciously disregards
 a substantial and unjustifiable risk?

257
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:23,923
So the issue is whether Eleanor Jordan
 was aware of the risk she created.

258
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:27,092
It's hard to believe
 that she was not aware that it was a risk.

259
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,861
Why is that so hard?

260
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,664
It's on every pack of cigarets
 says nothing about the risk of death.

261
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:35,634
Actually, all it says
 is that cigarets contain carbon monoxide.

262
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:39,438
If the risk doesn't have anything to do
 with death, it isn't a risk.

263
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:44,877
This one says quitting smoking
 now greatly reduces serious risks. Yeah.

264
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,379
What an understatement. Man, here it is.

265
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:51,650
Another warning Smoking causes
 lung cancer, heart disease and emphysema.

266
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:55,187
The one that warns
 about pregnancy and smoking.

267
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,122
Not a problem for old men.

268
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,759
Jordan, what's relevant is
 a pack of cigarets

269
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,896
does not warn the smoker
 that it creates a risk for others.

270
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:07,032
So the warning labels on
 the cigarets are irrelevant to this case.

271
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,168
Your business is guilty of murder

272
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:30,723
scene. And when I got pregnant,

273
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:35,127
I was about twenty seven at the time.

274
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,130
Everybody told me I shouldn't smoke,

275
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,699
but my doctor said his mother smoked
 when she was pregnant.

276
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:45,004
And if the stress in quitting was
 too much, then maybe I shouldn't even try.

277
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:47,906
I see. I didn't know what
 he was talking about.

278
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:49,508
The stress and quitting.

279
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,111
I mean, I figured you just stop.

280
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:57,149
So I put my cigarets away and that's
 when I noticed I didn't feel right.

281
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:58,984
And obviously, Cigarets

282
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:01,620
had something in them
 that kept you a certain way. You know.

283
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,759
And that's when I started to see them as

284
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,094
more than just something
 to do with my hands.

285
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,865
So I really stopped.

286
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,668
I didn't smoke for a whole week.

287
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,704
It was too much.

288
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,309
So I started again.

289
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:28,380
Maybe she didn't take him seriously
 when a son came home and told her,

290
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,549
maybe she didn't want to know,

291
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:34,286
but she certainly had to be aware of the
 possibility, the possibility and the risk

292
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:38,791
they go on the same family,
 even if she knew smoking was bad,

293
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,092
doesn't mean she knew

294
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:44,797
she was creating a risk to other bank
 or that there even is any risk.

295
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:50,469
Look, I don't believe any of the junk
 science that was presented at the trial.

296
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:54,206
Do I? Right. And we can see exactly
 what youth we wanted to believe.

297
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,475
It's not enough that she was aware
 she was creating a risk.

298
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,711
She had to be aware
 she was creating a grave risk. Thank you.

299
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:02,481
So it's a coincidence
 that the three of you all smoke.

300
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:03,182
That's irrelevant.

301
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:07,453
Irrelevant as it is that you miss Ingram
 and you miss Gifford, don't smoke.

302
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,222
The information's been in The New York
 Times almost every day for years.

303
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,558
What's been in The New York Times stories?

304
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,927
You can get stories
 that prove studies about this.

305
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,595
You get stories, a Pew study about that.

306
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:20,132
Until recently, if you ate eggs,
 you got high cholesterol

307
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,601
and it died from hardening
 of the arteries.

308
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,704
And now they've done a double blind study

309
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:28,907
that concludes you can eat as many eggs
 as you like. Exactly.

310
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:31,510
Because something is printed
 in The New York Times.

311
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,178
How significant is that?

312
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:36,014
Well, let everybody reads
 The New York Times. Really?

313
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:39,084
Can you even read

314
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:43,222
how much Hassan testified that
 she subscribed to The Times for 12 years?

315
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:46,758
Her son did not testify.
 She read any articles about tobacco.

316
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,427
He is cute. Thank you.

317
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:51,363
We're not going to go with this, Chuck,

318
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:54,833
unless you're with us
 100 percent of the way to. OK,

319
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:59,204
you realize people were like,
 what are you doing?

320
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:02,040
I don't care. Maybe someday

321
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,309
you'll tell us what's really going on
 in that head of yours.

322
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:09,314
I want his just to make a difference.

323
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,551
Actually, his life did make a difference.

324
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:18,257
He was a great pianist and composer,
 and George wanted to have it in the closet

325
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:22,094
not to know the dangers
 of second hand tobacco smoke.

326
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,564
Is there any reason to conclude
 that she's ignorant or illiterate?

327
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:28,700
She may have engaged in conduct
 which created some risk, but

328
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,070
that does not constitute
 a grave risk of death.

329
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:35,374
Let's not waste our time.
 So the fine. Grave risk, please.

330
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,502
Why aren't we making the connections?

331
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:08,040
So many scientists are advertised
 as a scientist, missing groom.

332
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,912
One might make a distinction between good
 and bad science and bad science

333
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:18,951
is often co-opted by the political system
 to sell a point of view.

334
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:22,054
And I suppose all the studies
 that say that secondhand smoke causes

335
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,157
cancer is bad science and all those
 that debunk it are good science.

336
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:27,092
All right. All right.

337
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:31,663
Now, maybe Eleanor Jordan
 made a substantial risk.

338
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,000
That still doesn't
 mean she's guilty of murder.

339
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:39,071
But what about the other elements, murder
 in the second degree

340
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:43,642
also requires that a person have
 a depraved indifference to human life.

341
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:47,112
Now you sing Eleanor Jones
 the parade in Seemed Parade.

342
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:51,950
She sang well, I wasn't perfect, but
 I think she at least cared for her family.

343
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,652
She was devoted to him.

344
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:56,488
I think we have you there.
 Anyone who smokes is depraved.

345
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,824
What about anyone who promotes tobacco?

346
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,759
What are you, a saint?

347
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,794
She's a damn schoolteacher.

348
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,730
What do you teach? Phys ed physics.

349
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:11,236
There are. They have

350
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:15,040
exactly the same stakes.

351
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,110
Hey, Zach, what am I going to do here?

352
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,145
Yeah, he likes you.

353
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:22,814
He totally like that.

354
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:25,550
OK, I will like him.

355
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:29,354
I just don't want it
 to be about any person.

356
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:32,924
Now my students aspire to be
 the men and women in your magazines.

357
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,926
Many of them get hooked
 on cigarets for life.

358
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:39,064
Does anyone consider taking responsibility
 for one's own actions?

359
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,699
I mean, let's ban butcher knife

360
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:44,303
from every kitchen because butcher knives
 not only cut me, but they cut people.

361
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:47,406
Let's ban automobiles
 because people get hit by Coors.

362
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,675
Let's ban everything.

363
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,277
This case is not about banning anything.

364
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:55,314
It's about personal responsibility.

365
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,685
We are having an ethical
 and philosophical debate

366
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:05,624
when we should be discussing causation
 of provable scientific connection

367
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,994
between the defendant's actions
 and her husband's death.

368
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:13,398
I would think that a high school physics
 teacher would appreciate

369
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:15,000
the issue of causation.

370
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,036
I'm with you there.

371
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:24,643
Didn't the judge give us examples
 of depraved indifference to human life?

372
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:29,114
Right. Like if someone shot a gun off
 into a crowded ballroom with people

373
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:33,218
drinking beer or somebody open the cage
 of a dangerous animal at the zoo,

374
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,753
they banned smoking from the zoos

375
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:38,390
to protect the animals
 from secondhand smoke. You're joking.

376
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:42,627
Look, firing a gun into a crowded
 ballroom is not the same thing

377
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,463
as smoking a pack of cigarets.

378
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:48,066
Wake up. We're doing the second degree
 doesn't seem to apply.

379
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,202
Thank you, Miss Ingram.

380
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:55,507
OK, I'll go along with that.

381
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,776
So everybody agree to have it shove him.

382
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,482
What's the next lesser crime

383
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,484
manslaughter and the second degree

384
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:10,522
is exactly the same as murder
 in the second degree, except

385
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,458
it doesn't include

386
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:16,461
a depraved indifference to human life.

387
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:23,235
But he or she recklessly causes the death

388
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,705
of another person.

389
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:40,218
I can't believe the judge didn't
 dismiss the murder two counts

390
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:43,522
because it's so obvious
 there's no immediate risk of death.

391
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:48,059
We didn't need a murder to Massachusetts

392
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:51,797
like a glove. Oh.

393
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:56,701
I was going to fall back
 on, they fall right into manslaughter,

394
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:58,904
too. OK, well, good.

395
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:02,808
But didn't we already go through

396
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:04,910
all the other elements
 and agree that they applied?

397
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:08,346
Are you people serious
 when somebody turned a light on in here?

398
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:12,984
This whole trial is a result of a sick kid
 who hates his mother.

399
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:16,254
Maybe he loves his father.

400
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:19,624
Does his motive really matter?

401
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:29,901
Hey, Jack Adobe like you doing?

402
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,870
How are you doing
 Dutch angles now, check it out.

403
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,473
I'll check out our movie
 Sunbaking. Dutch here.

404
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,608
Shoot your mouth, Magufuli.

405
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,610
Well, Sheila Cronenberg, I play.

406
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,811
Give me the camera al-Shami.

407
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,380
Like, oh, I got. All right.

408
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,782
Let's watch Jack.

409
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,218
You're always shooting.

410
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:48,453
I mean, we should shoot you
 eating all the time.

411
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,022
See how it feels
 to have the camera on you.

412
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:54,493
Oh, look up. Oh, now
 there's a lovely cigaret smile.

413
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:58,864
Look at the yellow teeth.

414
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:24,222
See the time I can't see time,
 Jackie, only experience.

415
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:29,427
Then I tell you to wake me up by nine.

416
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,029
That's the problem, Jack.

417
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,565
You ask me, instructed me,

418
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:37,536
for Christ's sake,
 Angela, were lovers were like,

419
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:41,606
you know, monogamous, which means we're
 supposed to support each other.

420
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:44,609
We're like monogamous dog.

421
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:47,312
Is that the same thing as being truly,
 totally monogamous?

422
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:50,015
I'm testifying today, Angela.

423
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:53,585
I have to be at the courthouse by nine.

424
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,424
Do you know that your mother
 and my mother talk to each other? What?

425
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,461
My mother, when I mean how they met once,

426
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:13,271
twice, Jack. Your mom

427
00:26:13,271 --> 00:26:16,508
thinks this whole thing is your fault

428
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:21,413
and she thinks or she thinks
 you started the whole thing. What?

429
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:22,948
That's bullshit.

430
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:23,949
You think I like this?

431
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:27,519
You think watching my mother
 being dragged through criminal court

432
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,187
is something I want?

433
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,924
Your mom thinks so.

434
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,627
She's paranoid, it's guilt talking.

435
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:38,263
Why did you agree to testify against her?

436
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,831
I don't have a choice.

437
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:42,000
Prosecutors are making me do it.

438
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,402
You were never subpoenaed.

439
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:47,138
You want to talk about this now?

440
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:50,542
You want to engage me
 in a debate about this now?

441
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:52,811
After all this time,

442
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:54,412
I didn't mean to upset you.

443
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:56,514
I'm sorry. Well, you did.

444
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,952
I'm sorry. More than OK.

445
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:11,529
Do you want to go to my place tonight
 or do you want to stay here tonight?

446
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,700
God, you're beautiful.

447
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:20,472
Here, if you don't mind, well, then, OK,

448
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:23,875
I want to get to the truth.

449
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:28,146
Follow the money and the money leads right
 to the son of the old lady goes to jail.

450
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:30,415
Didn't you hear there's no money.

451
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:32,150
The insurance contract is revoked.

452
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,754
It's not clear whether the contract
 is revoked once you're listening.

453
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:38,757
Whether the son is getting money or not

454
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:42,227
is not particularly relevant to whether
 or not Eleanor Jordan committed a crime.

455
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:44,929
It's a criminal case.
 He can't get any money.

456
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:48,366
Son testifying against his mother.

457
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:54,606
I sure hope it's about
 more than money, Mr. Jordan.

458
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:58,877
You would have us believe that you wish
 to punish your mother because of cigarets.

459
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:01,813
Let's be honest.

460
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:06,584
What did your mother really do to you
 that caused you to go on this crusade,

461
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:10,588
this tasteless public crusade of revenge?

462
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,491
Certainly not her smoking.

463
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:14,993
Objection, your honor.

464
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:17,295
The prosecution is goading the witness.

465
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,666
Overruled, and I'll hear this answer.

466
00:28:25,336 --> 00:28:27,372
I love my mother.

467
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:33,511
But I. I loved my.

468
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:35,547
Oh, would you please speak up?

469
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,749
We can't hear you.

470
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,319
I love my mother.

471
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:47,292
But I loved. My father to.

472
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:52,263
I believe her smoking killed him.

473
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:56,067
Is it not true that your father's
 insurance policy named your mother

474
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:59,070
the sole beneficiary?

475
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,610
Tell me about the insurance.

476
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,546
There is nothing to tell you
 already told me there is no money

477
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:12,350
in a criminal case and any money
 I get from anything related to this case .

478
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,352
So donate to charity.

479
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:15,019
I could care less.

480
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:18,723
She got him to put everything
 in her name only.

481
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,792
I would love to know what she did to you.

482
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:25,530
Her blindness fuels me.

483
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:29,701
So what happens when you're an addict?

484
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:32,303
It poisons everything she did.

485
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:35,607
My father was a weak man
 when it came to her.

486
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,843
He loved her very much.

487
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:42,580
And she got away with everything.

488
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:48,419
Can we turn it down or give me a headache?

489
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:55,260
Neighbor on the back.

490
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:59,197
Please do something,
 I can't take it anymore.

491
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:09,174
She started when she was very young

492
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:11,810
and she didn't think much about it
 until she got pregnant

493
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,745
and that only lasted one week.

494
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:18,316
She tried to quit on her son's birthday,
 so maybe she shouldn't disregard the risk.

495
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,752
So she was aware of the risks
 of smoking to herself.

496
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:23,087
It doesn't prove that she was aware
 of the risks of smoking to others.

497
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:26,758
The newspapers remember
 she knew it was harmful to her,

498
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:29,928
so she probably knew it was harmful
 to her husband as well.

499
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:33,832
There have been front page articles
 about secondhand smoke now for decades.

500
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,533
I've seen them. We've all seen them.

501
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:37,468
The testimony shows that she saw them.

502
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:40,405
So what doesn't prove anything?

503
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,974
What the hell would prove
 something to you?

504
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:45,810
Real scientific evidence.

505
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:48,580
Can we get that?

506
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,981
Where did you get your degree, Mr.

507
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:52,450
Gund from? Harvard University.

508
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,453
And how many years have you been
 an environmental pathologist?

509
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,722
Seventeen years, Mr. Gunn.

510
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:00,525
How many public buildings
 and private houses have you assessed

511
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:03,828
for the presence
 of carcinogenic chemicals? Hundreds.

512
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:06,598
Did you inspect the Jordan home
 and the school where Mr.

513
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:09,400
Jordan taught music for the past
 twenty five years? Yes, I did.

514
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,071
And what were your findings?

515
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:15,139
There were no carcinogenic chemicals
 in the workplace.

516
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:16,975
Tell us what you tested for.

517
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:21,346
Radon, asbestos and lead in the water,
 air and walls and tobacco smoke.

518
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,082
None in Mr. Jordan's place of business.

519
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,550
How do you know this?

520
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:29,354
I tested the air and chips of paint
 for the wall, and I investigated

521
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:32,190
the people who worked there
 and the Jordan residents.

522
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:35,326
There were residue chemicals in the paint,

523
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:38,730
chips, clothing, drapes
 and in the furniture.

524
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:42,967
These chemicals are all products
 of burning tobacco. What are they?

525
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:46,404
Acetone, ammonia, arsenic,

526
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:52,243
butane, DDT, ethanol, formaldehyde, hexa.

527
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,345
Mean hydrogen cyanide.

528
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,315
Hexton mean and hydrogen cyanide.

529
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:03,421
Barbecue lighter and gas chamber
 poison does in 20 milligrams

530
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,524
of nicotine kill
 an adult person? Absolutely.

531
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:10,762
Do you usually check for tobacco smoke
 when you check a site?

532
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,465
Not usually, no.

533
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:16,100
This was a novel request.

534
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,403
Poor woman is trying
 to conquer an addiction

535
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:21,539
and keep it away from her husband, and you
 people are going to hold it against her,

536
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:22,507
for Christ's sakes.

537
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:24,509
Just shows she knew he didn't like it.

538
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:26,577
Not that it was bad for him.

539
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:28,880
More Americans die from ettes than AIDS.

540
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:31,382
Sure. A lot of spouses
 want to look at it that way.

541
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:33,418
Who cares what your spouse thinks?

542
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,987
Look, nobody dies
 from environmental tobacco smoke.

543
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:37,555
Nobody dies from cigarets.

544
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:40,224
They die from cancer and heart disease.

545
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,894
So for that matter,
 nobody dies of AIDS either, right?

546
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:46,230
Don't they die from pneumonia or whatever
 else you get because they had AIDS.

547
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:49,934
Yeah. Well, less people die
 from smoking than don't.

548
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,369
What does that mean?

549
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:54,272
That we ought to scientifically figure out

550
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:58,042
why some people get lung cancer
 and why some don't?

551
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:00,645
So we can sanction people's bad habits.

552
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:02,914
Why do you have to sanction everything?

553
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:05,183
Some things need to be. Look,

554
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,852
I smoke sometimes.

555
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:09,821
I don't inhale. I like it.

556
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,056
Sometimes I smoke. A cigar hangs.

557
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,993
Put him in jail. He's creating etes.

558
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:16,728
Mr. Murphy, please.

559
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:20,431
Could you put that out? I'm about done.

560
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:22,233
You know, this notion that people die

561
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:25,470
from environmental tobacco
 smoke is really speculation.

562
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:29,340
And the studies that show the connection
 or what I call very soft

563
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:32,176
in science is more anecdotal
 than hard proof.

564
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,245
I would argue that it's common sense,

565
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:36,547
and I refuse to believe
 those statistics anyway.

566
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:38,983
Of course you do. Okay.

567
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:42,153
I'm going to kill this one
 now from the National Institute of Health.

568
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:44,422
The EPA, it's been plastered everywhere.

569
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:46,591
I wouldn't rely on government statistics.

570
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:51,062
They're not immune to political pressures
 and cultural demands.

571
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:54,098
And they don't prove
 Eleanor Jordan killed her husband.

572
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:55,566
But I don't think they have to.

573
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:59,537
They don't they just have to prove
 that the risk was substantial

574
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:02,206
and that she disregarded it.

575
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,208
And is it not a fact

576
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:09,614
that these high levels of radiation,
 even in one dose,

577
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:13,084
can result in cancer later in life?

578
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,021
It would be extremely unusual,
 but it can happen.

579
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,758
Yes. If the dosage is strong enough

580
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:26,197
and one of the types of cancer
 that's caused is lung cancer.

581
00:34:26,964 --> 00:34:30,068
Yes. One of the types.

582
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:35,406
So it is possible
 that at some time in his entire life, Mr.

583
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,941
Jordan could have inar

584
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:40,445
one of these public buildings
 or private homes that had high radiation.

585
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:43,081
It's possible, but unlikely.

586
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:45,883
But it could happen. Yes.

587
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:49,787
And as far as this list

588
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:54,292
actually sign and you know that deadly
 chemicals and the not so deadly chemicals,

589
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:57,562
I mean, aren't these the same chemicals
 that we find in automobile exhaust?

590
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:00,731
Not all of them. Some of them, yes.

591
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,037
So it's possible that
 if a window were opened in the Jordan hole

592
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:08,706
and a truck comes by
 with a broken muffler,

593
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:11,709
these chemicals could find their way
 into the Jordan hole.

594
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:15,580
Well, yes, it's possible, but you wouldn't
 find such concentrated residues

595
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,282
and you wouldn't
 find higher amounts in the rooms that Mrs.

596
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,184
Jordan smoked most.

597
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,123
I have no further questions.

598
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,191
Thank you, Mr. Gunn.

599
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:28,693
You may be excused.

600
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:31,496
What would be causing lung cancer
 in so many cases

601
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:34,265
where people who don't smoke
 but are around it?

602
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,502
What? We're not here to decide that lady.

603
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:38,936
No, in a way, we are.

604
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:41,372
I think the lady is right.

605
00:35:41,372 --> 00:35:42,406
Shall we move on then?

606
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:43,541
As I say, you don't like.

607
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,676
And move on to what? Lunch.

608
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,512
I need a cigaret.

609
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:50,214
I vote for letting this guy
 go to lunch and kill himself,

610
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:56,487
even if it's in your head. Yeah.

611
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:06,864
Can you come and see me
 after class about your exam?

612
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:11,602
You just fine, I just stop.

613
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:14,005
The second essay to help

614
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:18,209
put me away. Oh, my.

615
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:29,854
Ma'am, please raise your right hand.

616
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,390
Do you swear to tell the truth,
 the whole truth and nothing but the truth,

617
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,459
so help you God? I do.

618
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:40,097
Dr. Lin, would you please give us
 your credentials?

619
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:44,368
I'm a senior attending lung surgeon
 at Sloan Kettering Hospital in New York.

620
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:49,941
I'm also a professor of medicine
 at WHILE Medical College at Cornell.

621
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:54,345
And I've had three books published,
 all dealing with the ideology

622
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:56,881
of lung cancer and other cancers.

623
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:00,184
As a recognized medical expert.

624
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:02,753
Dr. Lin, would you please give us
 your professional opinion

625
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,457
on what effect one lit cigaret
 has on an innocent bystander?

626
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:11,629
One cigaret in a room at least four times

627
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:17,501
the size will contaminate
 that entire space within three minutes.

628
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:22,073
Everyone in the room will get nicotine
 in their blood after one breath.

629
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,508
So what the hell is your point?

630
00:37:24,508 --> 00:37:28,713
Well, she disregarded the risk like every
 smoker who lights up around anyone does.

631
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,215
You don't know shit about addiction.

632
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:32,550
I'm just a little bitter.

633
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,952
Mr. Murphy, I have
 every right to be so shut up.

634
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:34,445
And 10 to 19 cigarets a day increases
 the risk of breast cancer five fold.

635
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:37,648
And what does smoking around
 young girls have to do with Mr.

636
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,084
Jordan's lung cancer, Dr. Lin?

637
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:44,055
Secondhand smoke increases
 your chances of contracting lung cancer,

638
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:47,758
breast cancer, heart disease
 and many other deadly diseases.

639
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:49,360
It's all connected.

640
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,862
The studies are all out there.

641
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,934
So Mr. Jordan's love

642
00:38:56,934 --> 00:39:01,939
and Jack Junior's long, for that matter,
 were constantly contaminated for years

643
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:04,742
by Eleanor Jordans
 second hand smoke. Of course,

644
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,978
Jack Junior could contract lung

645
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:11,182
cancer somewhere down the line,
 even if he never smokes.

646
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:14,251
Objection, your honor.
 Speculation? Exactly.

647
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,588
Addicted or not?

648
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:21,559
Eleanor Jordan created a substantial
 and unjustifiable risk.

649
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:23,227
She was aware of it.

650
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:25,262
She disregarded it.

651
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:27,565
And it resulted in
 the death of Mr. Jordan.

652
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:30,601
And that's substantial
 and unjustifiable bullshit.

653
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:33,371
If a heroin addict kills for money

654
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:37,108
to support his habit,
 would you say that's justifiable?

655
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,911
I believe what the law is getting at is
 if someone does something

656
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:42,980
very risky and dangerous,

657
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:47,418
it does it for a justifiable reason,
 like to save someone's life .

658
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:50,421
Then he's excused.
 Even if someone dies in the process.

659
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:53,357
It's certainly not the case
 with Eleanor feeding her own addiction.

660
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:57,762
Well, this is all irrelevant because
 there's no way I'm convicting this woman.

661
00:39:57,762 --> 00:40:01,399
You have a responsibility
 to discuss this openly.

662
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:05,302
Mr. Cassidy, I'm
 not going to sit here and allow you

663
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:08,372
to convict a woman who had no intention
 of killing her husband,

664
00:40:08,672 --> 00:40:11,108
no matter what argument
 you people think you can support

665
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,011
for me to do something
 like convicting my own father.

666
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:16,280
Well, the forty five other
 million Americans

667
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,784
who smoke some smooth talking prosecutors
 try to manipulate us.

668
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:22,019
But you people can't see the big picture.

669
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:24,155
What is the big picture, Mr. Cassidy?

670
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:26,390
You ball busting bitch, don't you?

671
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,592
Hey, I'm good to.

672
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,262
This is not some saloon here.

673
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,931
Let's not get personal.

674
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:38,002
But maybe he's got a point.

675
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,371
Their sound or fury scare me, Mr. Cassidy.

676
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:43,941
You know, we're not permitted to leave
 until the case is decided.

677
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:47,578
Well, what if we don't finish tonight?
 Then we're sequestered.

678
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:52,049
Excuse me, but I really got to pee.

679
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,422
Yes, we're taking a short break.

680
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:21,345
So you're into this cause, huh?

681
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,518
Cause. Yeah, the

682
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:30,120
the anti tobacco cause I'm not a joiner.

683
00:41:31,856 --> 00:41:33,958
Yeah, I know what you mean.

684
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:36,894
You know, I think that's why it took me
 so long to quit.

685
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:41,232
I wasn't going to quit because
 all these people around me were and

686
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,903
the culture kind of shifted and.

687
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:49,640
You know, I started to notice that I was
 spending too much time in these doorways,

688
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:54,211
just huddling just in the freezing
 rain, the smoke and all these people

689
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:58,782
that was getting violent
 or their rights to smoking kids

690
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:03,120
with braces and pimples, they're smoking
 because they think it's cool.

691
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:07,725
I'm like, well, I'm
 going to bring you here.

692
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:09,360
So now I'm into Wales.

693
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:19,503
Wells. You go to demonstrations.

694
00:42:20,237 --> 00:42:22,573
I went to one. It was
 when I was on kitchen in

695
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:25,776
London was a Greenpeace rally
 and about a thousand people showed up.

696
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:31,015
Somebody at the rally said that
 5000 whales are slaughtered every year.

697
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,686
The thousand people
 showed up for 5000 wells.

698
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:54,071
You know, these young people,

699
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:58,175
I don't know. Oh, that woman.

700
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:02,413
She makes a point of view,
 without a doubt.

701
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:07,518
And you know, you know, my mind,

702
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:10,654
I didn't make up yet.

703
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:13,157
Everybody has their things

704
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,728
that things that things to defend,

705
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:21,231
to prove something about. Oh, yes. Yes.

706
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:26,070
I have only a few things left.

707
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:31,241
No wife. Another child.

708
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,112
Sometimes the truth is easier

709
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:37,548
to see when you have no things, no ties,

710
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,185
like when you're a young child.

711
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:43,320
You know, the two ends of life,

712
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:47,224
you arrive with nothing
 and you leave with nothing.

713
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:56,700
Lest. The shoe, the hair.

714
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:00,504
The more you see.

715
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:03,007
What do you see?

716
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:15,152
OK. OK. You read in high school

717
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:17,855
about the Indians.

718
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:27,031
Tobacco was their ritual.

719
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:33,137
It wasn't a big deal.

720
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:37,341
It said tobacco was a ceremony of planned

721
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:42,212
only harmful when used by the addict.

722
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:48,719
We got a lot of addicts today
 and big corporations to fuel them.

723
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:51,789
People need something, if not this what?

724
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:56,694
I'm still busy these days, it's too fast.

725
00:44:57,761 --> 00:45:01,331
The world is is heating up.

726
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:04,735
Maybe we're missing something.

727
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:10,441
Maybe only children and us old
 people should be serving on juries.

728
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,510
At least we understand each other.

729
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:17,481
They're just cigarets.

730
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:20,084
I was smoking cigarets.

731
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:22,186
When did you start smoking? Oh,

732
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:27,858
I was I think I had my
 first cigaret when I was 10.

733
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:33,130
A camp, I think I bought them

734
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:35,065
probably the first time
 in the eleventh grade

735
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,801
just to have them around,
 you know, because, well,

736
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,171
everybody smoked after school

737
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:42,973
or when you had a beer.

738
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:45,809
Why did you start smoking?

739
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:50,681
I mean, it was a thing to do.

740
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:53,150
Everybody did it.

741
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,718
My mother did it.

742
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:56,420
My father did it.

743
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:00,290
Lauren Bacall did it. Audrey Hepburn.

744
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:03,327
No harm was intended.

745
00:46:03,327 --> 00:46:05,129
It wasn't a drug.

746
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:07,765
Do you remember when it became
 an everyday habit?

747
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:12,603
Oh, I guess sometime in college
 I started to smoke every day to get.

748
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,639
So you just need to do it with certain
 things, you know, with your morning coffee

749
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,010
after you eat with a cocktail.

750
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:23,013
Right after sex.

751
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:26,183
Sometimes I'd pick up my cigarets
 before I'd even answer the phone.

752
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:44,668
You know, you're not the only one
 who's lost someone

753
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:50,474
sending me to prison
 isn't going to bring him back. It's

754
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,576
not up to you anymore.

755
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:55,813
Jack, I just wish
 that you could stand in my shoes.

756
00:46:55,846 --> 00:47:00,751
No, you you stand in his shoes. Fine.

757
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:04,755
Do what you have to.

758
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:12,729
Mr. Jordan's family
 had no history of lung cancer. No.

759
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:17,067
No history of any other type of cancer.

760
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:19,503
No, they did not.

761
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:22,472
How long have you been the family doctor?

762
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,975
Thirty seven years.

763
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:27,845
Mr. Jordan never smoked?

764
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:30,380
Not that I'm aware of.

765
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:35,752
Did you ever warn Eleanor Jordan
 about smoking cigarets? Yes.

766
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:38,589
What did you tell her

767
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:40,691
she should stop?

768
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:44,561
Why do I have to answer this?

769
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,232
She must have had some idea
 about what might happen to her

770
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:50,701
if she continued to smoke.

771
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,371
I thought she would become ill.

772
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:57,007
And how did she respond
 to your words of wisdom?

773
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,376
You're a doctor.

774
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,545
So was it fair to assume that, Eleanor?

775
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,146
Objection, your honor.

776
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:06,183
Sustained. Will the prosecution
 please get to the point?

777
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,318
Yes, Your Honor.

778
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:13,557
How did Eleanor Jordan
 respond to your warning?

779
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:16,793
I think she said she would try to stop.

780
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:21,231
Did you warn her
 about smoking around her husband?

781
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:25,135
No. No. Why not?

782
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:28,639
I thought it would be consequential.

783
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:31,208
How about her son? I'm sorry.

784
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:35,879
Did you think that her smoking
 would harm her child?

785
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:41,151
Well, perhaps for maybe, sir, Dr.

786
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:44,521
Hurst, if it would hurt her child,

787
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:49,192
wouldn't it follow that
 it might hurt her husband?

788
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:52,763
Not necessarily.

789
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,399
Not necessarily, no.

790
00:48:55,399 --> 00:48:57,634
You mean it never crossed your mind?

791
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:00,804
Might have crossed my mind,
 but that does not make it a fact.

792
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:04,207
Why don't you look at it
 like coming to terms with this death?

793
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,109
Because this is about more than that.

794
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:11,648
Chicken. I'm sorry.

795
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,619
I am. You're right.

796
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:20,891
There is no going back.

797
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:24,728
You spoke, doctor.

798
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:26,163
Oh, no, I don't.

799
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:28,932
Do you ever smoke?

800
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:31,935
Yes. Every smoke around children.

801
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:34,237
Objection, your honor. Irrelevant.

802
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:36,940
Overruled. Thank you.

803
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,377
No further questions.

804
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:51,521
Oh, well. Right, right, right. Yeah.

805
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,259
Oh, wow. Oh, OK.

806
00:49:57,094 --> 00:50:00,130
OK. Mommy, daddy. Oh,

807
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:02,632
hey. Oh, God. Hey, buddy.

808
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:14,144
It's. All the cameras,

809
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:17,381
honey. Oh, oh, hey.

810
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:45,308
I have to get something.

811
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:57,220
I wonder if her son's going to get lung
 cancer eventually, too.

812
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:59,356
He deserves it after what
 he put his mother through.

813
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:02,192
What about him? What about what
 he's gone through?

814
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:04,428
I think we're going off here. No, no, no.

815
00:51:05,128 --> 00:51:07,230
Maybe we are not.

816
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:10,100
Maybe we are doing what
 we are supposed to be doing.

817
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:13,003
And we thank you.

818
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:15,072
Why won't you acknowledge that Mrs.

819
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:20,310
Jordan's smoking might have added
 considerably to her husband getting lung

820
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:24,781
cancer? We are dealing with speculation,
 not saying exactly.

821
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:28,885
We as a jury are asked to speculate,
 which I believe means

822
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:32,956
to use one powers of conception
 and judgment and inference.

823
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:35,826
That is the difference
 between a law and science.

824
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:37,961
Science requires certainty.

825
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:42,232
The law only requires
 beyond a reasonable doubt.

826
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:44,734
We can't be experts about everything.

827
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:47,037
And why don't we have a responsibility
 to know the truth

828
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:50,674
and to inquire about
 the reliability of our sources?

829
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:54,077
Well, then we should all go to MIT
 or Harvard. Is that where you went?

830
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:59,049
Oh, well, in nineteen fifty

831
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:02,853
three, Winder, a research scientist
 at Sloan Kettering,

832
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:07,290
published his findings,
 condensate taken from cigaret, smoke

833
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:12,028
painted on the backs of mice
 caused malignant tumors to develop.

834
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:15,932
But the earliest warning that I know of

835
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:21,238
was Luther Burbank, a botanist
 who said that smoking is nothing

836
00:52:21,238 --> 00:52:25,542
more or less than a slow
 but sure lingering form of suicide.

837
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:29,079
And that was the early nineteen
 hundreds smokers lung.

838
00:52:29,446 --> 00:52:34,084
He started in high school,
 smoked on and off for twenty seven years,

839
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:38,188
pack a day emphysema detected at 43.

840
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:40,524
Stop smoking at 45.

841
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:44,261
Lung cancer identified at 54.

842
00:52:44,761 --> 00:52:46,963
Your Honor, I object to the submission
 of this testimony.

843
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:49,366
There's no foundation established.

844
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:51,902
We have no idea who
 these people overruled.

845
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:55,705
This is a healthy woman, Slurm, a wife,

846
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:59,342
mother, grandmother and great grandmother.

847
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:02,112
No one in the family or home smoked.

848
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:04,915
She died at ninety seven.

849
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:08,818
Now this is Mr. Jordan's lung.

850
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:12,689
And as you know, he never smoked

851
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,592
and he died of lung cancer.

852
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:17,460
For the record, I object again.

853
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:22,866
Could you believe
 the son that cut up his own father

854
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:26,836
so he could throw his mother in jail
 all this time for one of your magazines?

855
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:29,673
Well, I could just see
 the Cigaret ads in between.

856
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:32,676
You don't know anything about what I do
 or why I do it. Right.

857
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:36,479
Autopsy proof that there was residue
 of tar found in Mr.

858
00:53:36,479 --> 00:53:41,551
Jordan and his testicles and brain tissue,
 traces of nicotine, all of his body.

859
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:44,120
The scar tissue was grotesque.

860
00:53:44,654 --> 00:53:47,457
My roommate, she's a smoker
 and she would die

861
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:51,161
if she could see the gonk
 that that doctor wiped from his lungs.

862
00:53:51,194 --> 00:53:53,230
Maybe he should sue your roommate
 for attempted murder.

863
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:56,032
So there is a connection. It's a joke.

864
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:58,368
What's wrong with you people?
 You have no sense of humor.

865
00:53:58,635 --> 00:54:01,805
I'm working on my sense of humor
 for black lungs and heart disease.

866
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:03,607
Blame this on the D.A..

867
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:05,642
Maybe smokers should
 put two and two together.

868
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:10,880
No, I'll be hungover in the morning.

869
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,618
Sheila never told me why

870
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:16,686
everyone wants to blame Big Daddy

871
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:22,025
corporation governments, but not one
 individual wants to own up to anything.

872
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:23,493
Most of those people

873
00:54:23,493 --> 00:54:27,264
that lined up against big tobacco,
 they went home, kept right on smoking.

874
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:31,501
So it's you was me, this case.

875
00:54:32,902 --> 00:54:35,071
She was a fan of your dad's.

876
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:39,175
You did all the research.

877
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,578
She has a great job.

878
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:45,148
She wants attorney general. Next election.

879
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:59,362
I'm sorry. The new job. Yeah.

880
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,433
How is it? It's exciting.

881
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:09,639
It's kind of scary, though,
 you know, because it's my first big break.

882
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:15,078
New York magazine
 hardly a place for an aspiring journalist.

883
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:20,383
I'm not really sure I understand that
 subtext, are you not happy for me?

884
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:23,386
No, I'm I'm happy for you. It's just that.

885
00:55:25,121 --> 00:55:29,159
What I know how you got the job

886
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,263
you do. Well, how is that?

887
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:39,135
The publisher of your employer
 is a friend of my mother.

888
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:41,571
You know, I don't think
 you know anything, Jack.

889
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:44,841
I don't think that you have a grip
 on reality at all.

890
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:46,376
Don't talk to me about you.

891
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:48,011
Lower your voice.

892
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:52,115
Listen, I think that your mother
 is really intelligent.

893
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,552
All right, she is hardworking.

894
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:58,521
She has a respect of the entire
 publishing community.

895
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,590
And I don't think
 that I did anything wrong

896
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:02,892
by asking her to make a phone call for me.

897
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:07,764
Did you read that article? What article?

898
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,834
The one in your new magazine
 that you worked for.

899
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:14,304
Did you read what they said about me?

900
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:16,740
He called me a failed

901
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:20,777
filmmaker who now can't even
 make it as a photographer.

902
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:25,949
He called me a failure and said that
 I am jealous of my own mother

903
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:30,787
and that this jealousy is somehow driving
 me to bury her with this prosecution.

904
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:33,890
You telling me you didn't read that
 because it's not like you, Angela.

905
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:36,459
Not to do your homework. I read it.

906
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:42,265
OK, so I didn't have anything to do
 with that article.

907
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:45,769
Will you marry me? What?

908
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:52,409
Oh, my God. This is really interesting.

909
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,845
Do you really think I'm going to believe
 that you mean that?

910
00:56:55,845 --> 00:56:58,181
Of course. You say you love me.

911
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:00,183
I say I love you. It's self-evident.

912
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:04,187
This is a test. The only reason
 you're asking me that is because,

913
00:57:04,187 --> 00:57:06,189
you know, I'm going to say no.

914
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:07,724
I don't know that.

915
00:57:07,724 --> 00:57:09,659
In fact, I'm surprised.

916
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:12,429
Surprised, you know, I'm
 not ready for marriage.

917
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:14,330
The only reason you're asking me

918
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:16,900
that is because you want to sabotage
 this relationship.

919
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:20,937
You want to use my refusal
 to accept your offer of marriage

920
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:23,106
as a reason to walk away.

921
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:25,108
I think that you're
 upset about my new job,

922
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:27,677
and I think it's confused in your head

923
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:30,880
about where my loyalties are to
 you and your mom.

924
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,817
And that's stupid article.

925
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:35,952
You know what? I think that
 you need to sober up

926
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:38,421
and try not to destroy
 another relationship.

927
00:57:40,924 --> 00:57:42,592
What does that mean?

928
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:48,231
I don't know. I don't know what I mean,
 I don't know what I mean anymore.

929
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:51,468
Excuse me. Excuse me.

930
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:56,406
Can I have a glass of wine, please?

931
00:57:56,406 --> 00:57:59,209
Thanks. You're accusing me

932
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:01,711
of destroying my relationship
 with my mother, aren't you?

933
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:07,450
Actually, excuse me,
 can we get a bottle of wine, please?

934
00:58:07,684 --> 00:58:09,886
You don't mind, do you?

935
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:19,062
Why don't we do this,
 you have an evening with a bottle of wine,

936
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:24,100
your favorite companion
 and I will spend an evening with myself.

937
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:26,035
Your favorite companion?

938
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:31,741
Come on, I'm sorry.

939
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:34,077
I just I thought it was a clever comeback.

940
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:45,321
My sister's is ain't
 nobody has been this bad dude.

941
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:49,359
Got a sign on the door, says,
 you don't like my smoke. Stop, are you?

942
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:55,532
But sometimes when I'm doing it,

943
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:58,568
I think this is nuts.

944
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:02,639
I'm just sitting there with my cigaret
 between these two fingers

945
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:05,909
and it's on fire and I'm looking at it
 like it's some magical thing.

946
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:10,380
I took a drag on it
 and I'm filling up my lungs with this

947
00:59:11,481 --> 00:59:14,918
poison and it's coming out of my nostrils.

948
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:16,886
I must look awful.

949
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:19,455
Smoke coming out of your nostrils
 can't look right.

950
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:25,495
And so I think this is
 something a better step.

951
00:59:26,629 --> 00:59:30,900
But then. My mind's,
 which is JOUS, you know,

952
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:34,203
among those channels of and I just

953
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:37,307
do it all over again.

954
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:40,610
Excuse me, but it appears
 the prosecution does not have to prove

955
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:45,014
an actual connection, just that
 it was reasonably foreseeable, right.

956
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:47,850
Reasonably foreseeable,
 beyond a reasonable doubt.

957
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:51,254
Is there any doubt at all
 that this wasn't reasonably foreseeable?

958
00:59:51,387 --> 00:59:54,924
Does anyone else think she's guilty?

959
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:57,660
Are you people from this planet,

960
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:59,262
you convict this woman,
 you got forty five,

961
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:01,331
they know the crooks
 just out there running free.

962
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:04,300
That's almost a third
 of the population. Hello.

963
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:06,936
A third of the population
 is not a standard.

964
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:09,672
I used to steal my mother's
 boss's cigarets.

965
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:12,241
She was so elegant like Hollywood.

966
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:14,210
Hollywood loves tobacco.

967
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:18,881
Hollywood is set back, then put Hollywood
 on trial, not Eleanor Jordan.

968
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:20,917
You can't do this.
 You can't do that. What's next?

969
01:00:20,917 --> 01:00:22,218
Peanut butter, hamburgers.

970
01:00:22,218 --> 01:00:25,455
OK, so then let everyone
 speed, pollute, dump.

971
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:29,726
You want to take away our rights
 and about rights or freedom?

972
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:32,061
It's about the golden rule.

973
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:34,097
You wanted to convict her
 from the time that you walked in here.

974
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:36,599
You wanted to acquit her
 from the moment you walked in here.

975
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:41,771
Whatever we do, it's
 going to have big consequences.

976
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:44,540
Someone close to
 you die cancer or something.

977
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:47,510
I can't allow you to use this form
 to air your personal grudges

978
01:00:48,177 --> 01:00:49,812
and be a part of it.

979
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:51,714
I am not airing my personal grudges.

980
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:53,149
I know why and how she did it.

981
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:55,284
But that's not free
 her from responsibility.

982
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:34,357
Not that. Many people

983
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:37,660
who know far less have stopped
 smoking permanently.

984
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:42,865
They realize the substantial risk
 of smoking and of inhaling smoke.

985
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:44,500
OK, but isn't it true

986
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:47,570
that more people fail
 than succeed in spite of what they know?

987
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:52,341
Yes. Why is that?

988
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:57,780
Because nicotine is far more addictive
 than cocaine or heroin.

989
01:01:59,582 --> 01:02:01,050
Any other reason?

990
01:02:01,284 --> 01:02:03,486
Well, most cigaret smokers suffer from

991
01:02:03,486 --> 01:02:07,523
not only a physical addiction,
 but also a psychological one.

992
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:11,694
So these two addictions lock together,
 make it virtually impossible

993
01:02:11,694 --> 01:02:12,462
to quit smoking.

994
01:02:12,462 --> 01:02:14,564
Oh, no, not impossible.

995
01:02:14,697 --> 01:02:16,699
Extremely difficult.

996
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:19,135
It's far more difficult
 to die of lung cancer.

997
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:21,104
Just answer my question.

998
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:22,472
Yes, it's difficult.

999
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:23,940
But thank you very much.

1000
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,042
No further questions, Your Honor.

1001
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:30,379
Tobacco companies are taking the blame.

1002
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:32,482
They're losing in settling cases
 all over the place.

1003
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:35,384
Isn't it convenient to keep blaming
 everybody else for our actions?

1004
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:40,490
Oh, we agree. So you wasn't depraved
 and perhaps didn't have awareness

1005
01:02:41,457 --> 01:02:44,727
or at least never intended
 to harm a husband.

1006
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:47,930
But do we agree that
 she created a grave risk

1007
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:50,700
that resulted in
 or caused the death of her husband?

1008
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:53,202
The judge will probably be shocked
 if we can, Victor.

1009
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:55,404
Judge, probably just give a
 slap on the wrist,

1010
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:57,974
make a do community
 service, something like that.

1011
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:01,944
Wow, it really get tense in there, huh?

1012
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:05,414
Always feels that way
 when you're in the middle of it.

1013
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:08,618
I mean, people scream and yell,
 but eventually a moment occurs.

1014
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,253
You'd be a brief moment.

1015
01:03:10,253 --> 01:03:13,823
But in a car where everyone sees
 a common ground,

1016
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:17,860
you have to capitalize on that moment.

1017
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:22,632
People's energies will be down
 and be tired of fighting that point.

1018
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:26,302
You can force a consensus.

1019
01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:29,272
I guess I just thought it would be more
 of a rational discussion

1020
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:33,843
and we would arrive at a decision,
 you know the truth.

1021
01:03:35,044 --> 01:03:37,413
This is not about truth.

1022
01:03:37,413 --> 01:03:41,150
It's about personal interest
 and politics and politics.

1023
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,387
I thought this was about justice.

1024
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:46,122
People do politics.

1025
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:48,524
God does justice.

1026
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:57,934
Manslaughter is too severe.

1027
01:03:57,934 --> 01:04:00,670
The elements fit as a feel, right?

1028
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:04,807
You fanaticism, no cell,
 but you're a closet smoker.

1029
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:07,577
Somebody's got them business.
 What I do. Really?

1030
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:10,213
How else are we supposed
 to interpret your opinions?

1031
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:13,482
Interpret my opinions.
 That was that supposed to mean.

1032
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:16,185
Look, miss, whatever your name is.

1033
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,921
Don't try to psychoanalyze me, OK?

1034
01:04:18,921 --> 01:04:20,857
This isn't group therapy.

1035
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,892
And I'm not on trial here.

1036
01:04:22,892 --> 01:04:26,529
I'm having doubts
 that justice can come from this room

1037
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:29,665
filled with 12 angry jurors.

1038
01:04:29,899 --> 01:04:32,134
I'm not angry, Mr. Epstein.

1039
01:04:33,269 --> 01:04:35,238
And you did say your father smoked.

1040
01:04:35,238 --> 01:04:37,373
I did not. I think you did.

1041
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:43,880
I didn't say my father smoked because I
 don't have a father punch in nosy people.

1042
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,581
I met my brother.

1043
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:47,783
And you know what? So what of it?

1044
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:50,686
I'm just measured as all.

1045
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:53,990
OK, now you're going to try
 and put my brother on trial here.

1046
01:04:55,124 --> 01:04:56,859
You see what your people are doing.

1047
01:04:56,859 --> 01:04:58,427
Look at how you've drifted.

1048
01:04:58,427 --> 01:05:01,964
You came in here with common sense,
 but you're all leaving brainwashed.

1049
01:05:03,132 --> 01:05:06,102
So did he stop? He's dead.

1050
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:11,207
And whether or not I get lung cancer,
 he'll never be a murderer.

1051
01:05:12,275 --> 01:05:13,542
Two packs a day.

1052
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:18,347
My mom sort of stressed out
 by the situation, lit up.

1053
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:24,053
Do you think your father loved
 your mother? Very much so.

1054
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:28,190
Did your mother love your father?

1055
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,696
Sometimes I wonder.

1056
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:40,269
What do you mean by that? Well.

1057
01:05:41,837 --> 01:05:47,276
I wonder. How she could
 have loved him as much.

1058
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:52,615
As she said she did, and constantly
 blow smoke in space.

1059
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:55,785
Did she ever try and quit?

1060
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:58,287
Yeah, she did. But but

1061
01:06:00,156 --> 01:06:02,925
but she always left
 the cigarets. Take precedent.

1062
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:06,762
Precedence over what?

1063
01:06:07,196 --> 01:06:09,899
Everything. Over

1064
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:14,370
dad for our health. Over me.

1065
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,406
Thank you, Jack.

1066
01:06:17,406 --> 01:06:19,575
No further questions.

1067
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:26,515
Things change society
 sometimes in change, smooth,

1068
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:29,352
and sometimes it jerks along and some

1069
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:33,589
somebody's gonna get hurt. Everet,

1070
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:37,293
spare me the philosophy,
 OK? I want to vote.

1071
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:52,742
We'll start with you. You know.

1072
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:57,813
I can't remember

1073
01:06:57,813 --> 01:07:00,416
one time we made love
 and you haven't lit up before and after.

1074
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:05,054
Unless there's no break and he just
 burns throughout, what are you doing?

1075
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:10,659
And I don't want
 to be an accomplice anymore.

1076
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,529
There is like a companion.

1077
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:18,067
Wow. That's the reliable.

1078
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:22,471
I don't want to compete with a drug.

1079
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,007
It's too depressing to quit.

1080
01:07:25,007 --> 01:07:28,377
You know, if I need one right now,
 you should support me

1081
01:07:28,744 --> 01:07:30,813
and not if I love you.

1082
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:32,915
It's not that simple.

1083
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:36,552
You know, I'm going to hang around
 and watch you quietly

1084
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:39,922
puff away while you drive
 your coffin, nails India, ready for

1085
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:43,325
what I call myself your lover

1086
01:07:43,692 --> 01:07:45,761
and your husband to be.

1087
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:49,498
What is that? Is that an ultimatum?

1088
01:07:53,502 --> 01:07:56,172
Well, then we sold our home.

1089
01:07:56,172 --> 01:07:59,542
It was very emotional for me, and

1090
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:02,478
while I was saddled with the task of

1091
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:06,348
triaging, packing up decades of stuff,

1092
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:09,985
it was completely overwhelming.

1093
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:13,456
And I realized as I stood
 there surrounded by all these boxes

1094
01:08:13,456 --> 01:08:15,224
and packing supplies,
 that this is the first time

1095
01:08:15,224 --> 01:08:17,526
I had ever undertaken
 a major task like that

1096
01:08:18,661 --> 01:08:20,663
without my cigarets there to

1097
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:24,133
take the edge off, you know. So

1098
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,235
a quick trip to the corner store.

1099
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:29,872
And I was able to start
 making some sense out of it again. I,

1100
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:35,044
I felt so guilty

1101
01:08:35,044 --> 01:08:37,746
that I kept the pack in the glove
 compartment of my car.

1102
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:42,084
And of course, my son found them.

1103
01:08:42,084 --> 01:08:44,353
He was very upset.

1104
01:08:44,353 --> 01:08:48,057
I think he took it personally because
 I had quit smoking on his birthday.

1105
01:08:49,091 --> 01:08:52,161
He considered it my gift to him.

1106
01:08:52,528 --> 01:08:54,797
Your Honor. No further questions.

1107
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,799
So what else do you suggest the late Mr.

1108
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:58,834
Jordan should have done
 to get you to stop?

1109
01:08:58,834 --> 01:09:00,870
Put you in a straitjacket?

1110
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:02,471
I don't know. Perhaps,

1111
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:07,076
perhaps what? Perhaps

1112
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:12,148
he should have given me a real ultimatum.

1113
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:16,018
Well, given your dedication to yourself,
 you're burning cigarets

1114
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:17,419
on your literary career.

1115
01:09:17,419 --> 01:09:22,491
Do you really think an ultimatum would
 have made you stop smoking permanently?

1116
01:09:26,695 --> 01:09:32,067
Honestly. Sheila? I don't know.

1117
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:37,072
I would like to think so.

1118
01:09:37,072 --> 01:09:41,544
Someone leaves an infant
 sitting on a windowsill, five flights up.

1119
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:48,117
And she falls. That's manslaughter
 in the second degree.

1120
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:51,020
No doubt she was going to fall.

1121
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:54,390
But if you leave a window open

1122
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:57,726
and you leave the child in the next room

1123
01:09:57,726 --> 01:10:01,197
alone, fully intending to go back in
 and check on her,

1124
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:06,435
but somehow she makes it into the room
 with the open window and falls.

1125
01:10:09,271 --> 01:10:12,841
That's criminally negligent homicide.

1126
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:18,180
One is outright playing
 with fire. The other.

1127
01:10:20,816 --> 01:10:23,786
She can still be found guilty
 of criminally negligent homicide,

1128
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:26,422
even if she wasn't
 aware of the risks she made.

1129
01:10:26,956 --> 01:10:32,428
Criminally negligent homicide
 needs substantial risk, no awareness.

1130
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,035
I know I got to fair.

1131
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:41,971
All right, all right,
 all right, I'll pick him up.

1132
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:48,077
Oh, gosh, Jack. All
 right, all right, all right.

1133
01:10:49,845 --> 01:10:52,181
How do you think you guys did?

1134
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:59,989
And do you think
 the biggest mistake you you know,

1135
01:11:02,057 --> 01:11:04,693
when you figure out is your. How? How.

1136
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:08,864
Oh. Oh, sorry. Oh, I know.

1137
01:11:12,534 --> 01:11:15,771
Oh, I don't want to do that.

1138
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:19,441
It's a mistake. No,
 there's nothing to explain.

1139
01:11:19,675 --> 01:11:23,078
We all want to know
 what's driving your son.

1140
01:11:23,078 --> 01:11:25,214
Everybody's focused on your tobacco use.

1141
01:11:26,982 --> 01:11:29,551
Look, my son thinks I neglected him.

1142
01:11:30,753 --> 01:11:34,156
Thanks. I was working.

1143
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:39,728
We weren't I don't we never

1144
01:11:41,897 --> 01:11:44,700
we weren't connected.

1145
01:11:50,706 --> 01:11:54,610
And. I was tough,

1146
01:11:55,711 --> 01:11:58,080
maybe I wasn't very forgiving.

1147
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,249
Did you ever hit him? No,

1148
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:04,753
my husband was the sensitive one,
 or he always sided with Jackie.

1149
01:12:05,721 --> 01:12:07,756
I was the one who
 had to enforce the rules.

1150
01:12:09,591 --> 01:12:13,729
We have to couch this in more simple
 terms, you know, neglect, abuse.

1151
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:20,769
Abuse. Right, listen,

1152
01:12:23,305 --> 01:12:25,774
you're a working mother. You're busy.

1153
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:29,511
Maybe you're a bit excessive
 with the discipline.

1154
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:33,682
You employed corporal punishment
 at a time in his life

1155
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:37,453
when he was somewhat sensitive
 about young adolescent.

1156
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:42,324
This would explain to the jury
 why he's on this crusade.

1157
01:12:43,659 --> 01:12:44,560
I don't know, Jordan.

1158
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:49,264
I know this is difficult for you,
 but you've decided to take the stand again

1159
01:12:50,232 --> 01:12:52,267
and then attempt to explain to all of us,

1160
01:12:52,935 --> 01:12:56,505
including the jury,
 something that we've all been wondering.

1161
01:12:57,706 --> 01:13:00,209
And that is the answer
 to a simple question.

1162
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:06,515
Why would a son testify
 against his own mother?

1163
01:13:08,484 --> 01:13:11,887
Willingly, earnestly, almost gleefully,

1164
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:17,693
in an attempt to convict her of a crime
 that many of us here feel is bogus.

1165
01:13:19,161 --> 01:13:22,131
Why this vendetta?

1166
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:25,401
Could you please tell us
 why your son would do this?

1167
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:27,369
Conjecture, Your Honor,

1168
01:13:28,704 --> 01:13:31,273
you raise the issue denied

1169
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:39,481
continued assertion. Well.

1170
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:46,021
My husband was a very loving father,

1171
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:51,193
but he was always the lenient one,
 and I was always the one

1172
01:13:51,193 --> 01:13:57,166
who had to set the rules, you know,
 provide the discipline. And our son.

1173
01:13:59,234 --> 01:14:02,104
Since he was very little, has

1174
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:05,274
had problems been somewhat difficult.

1175
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:11,280
He often got into trouble in school
 and his friends.

1176
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:15,918
Well, many of them were the problem kids
 in the neighborhood.

1177
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:22,658
I once found drugs, pills in his room,

1178
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:25,427
and I was concerned, I was very concerned.

1179
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:29,698
So I restricted his hours
 and I prevented him

1180
01:14:29,698 --> 01:14:32,434
from associating with the kids
 that I thought were the bad influence.

1181
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:39,608
Did you ever hit him? Once, once.

1182
01:14:40,876 --> 01:14:43,412
I yelled at him in front of
 some of his friends in the neighborhood,

1183
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:47,649
and he got so mad, he was so rude.

1184
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:52,321
I slapped him in
 the face in front of his friends.

1185
01:14:53,555 --> 01:14:55,858
I don't I don't think he ever forgave me.

1186
01:14:57,025 --> 01:15:01,063
And he pretty much excluded me
 from his life after that.

1187
01:15:02,064 --> 01:15:04,933
I think he's still trying to punish me
 for that incident.

1188
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:15,010
No way. I'm not going to let

1189
01:15:15,377 --> 01:15:19,481
what she said in the press. Oh, all right.

1190
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:22,050
We will let your mother's testimony
 stand the way it is.

1191
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:24,653
The issue is your mother's action, OK?

1192
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:34,930
I'm going to go with criminal negligence.

1193
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:39,501
We will be sending a message.

1194
01:15:39,501 --> 01:15:42,204
Well, I'm not sending messages.

1195
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:43,272
I just want to do the thing.

1196
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:45,741
That's right. OK, let's vote.

1197
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:49,912
Those in favor of criminally
 negligent homicide.

1198
01:15:50,979 --> 01:15:52,314
Raise your hands.

1199
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:58,053
I'm not voting. The elements
 of criminally negligent homicide.

1200
01:15:58,587 --> 01:16:00,589
They fit maybe the elements
 aren't important.

1201
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:03,325
Maybe that's why we're not given
 jury instructions in writing,

1202
01:16:03,325 --> 01:16:07,195
because we're not supposed to do
 some mechanical analysis of elements.

1203
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:11,400
Maybe we're supposed
 to react emotionally, that is with

1204
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,736
compassion, have little compassion
 for addicts at this moment.

1205
01:16:15,103 --> 01:16:18,240
Now, deal with the
 consequences of her actions.

1206
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,276
Smokers should have to think twice
 before they blow smoke

1207
01:16:21,276 --> 01:16:22,945
in somebody else's direction.

1208
01:16:22,945 --> 01:16:28,016
And so should every movie star
 and model and friend and family member.

1209
01:16:29,384 --> 01:16:30,986
How else are we supposed to fight?

1210
01:16:30,986 --> 01:16:33,455
A hundred billion dollar industry.

1211
01:16:34,122 --> 01:16:35,958
I've had enough of this.

1212
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:38,427
You see you see what I mean?
 She wants to hang everybody.

1213
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:41,797
She's a fanatic.
 She wants to put everybody on trial.

1214
01:16:41,863 --> 01:16:45,567
Someone has died unnecessarily
 and we should know who is responsible.

1215
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:46,668
What about Jack Senior?

1216
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:48,570
Why can't he take
 responsibility for remaining?

1217
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:49,605
What, Eleanor Jordan

1218
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:52,808
for living in the same house,
 for staying there while she smoked

1219
01:16:52,808 --> 01:16:56,244
or evil cigarets, maybe even
 for marrying her in the first place?

1220
01:16:56,845 --> 01:17:00,082
Why can we put responsibility
 where responsibility goes?

1221
01:17:00,415 --> 01:17:02,918
Why are we blaming Eleanor Jordan?
 What about Jack Senior?

1222
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:05,020
He could have left. The guy could've left.

1223
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:10,392
Mr. Cassidy, if I let you stick a knife
 in my chest, even after I had been warned.

1224
01:17:10,525 --> 01:17:12,894
You said us. Don't get the.

1225
01:17:13,562 --> 01:17:15,897
Everybody knows that
 a knife will kill you.

1226
01:17:15,897 --> 01:17:19,835
Not everybody knows or believes
 that ambiens cigaret smoke will kill you.

1227
01:17:20,202 --> 01:17:21,069
But you know what?

1228
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:24,439
There are tons of studies
 that have made it clear, Max.

1229
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:26,541
But you you know,
 you don't want to believe them

1230
01:17:26,675 --> 01:17:29,945
because your brother smoked around you
 because he died of lung cancer. Sell it.

1231
01:17:30,712 --> 01:17:33,281
Keep it up. Just go up.
 Please make your vote.

1232
01:17:33,515 --> 01:17:34,483
You and your dead brother.

1233
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:38,253
Look at them. Look at them,

1234
01:17:39,187 --> 01:17:42,591
goddammit. Look at them.

1235
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:47,029
Are those the same?

1236
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:49,698
Are you going to tell me that
 those are the same things?

1237
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:07,749
Family here, they're the family. Wow.

1238
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,156
What are you watching and.

1239
01:18:17,225 --> 01:18:18,994
Let me have ten more minutes

1240
01:18:18,994 --> 01:18:22,431
and then we read a book, OK? OK.

1241
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:40,515
Earlier today, a verdict was reached

1242
01:18:40,515 --> 01:18:45,253
in that bizarre murder trial
 after a surprising six hour deliberation.

1243
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:48,523
The jury acquitted
 Eleanor Jordan of all charges

1244
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:51,560
concerning the death
 of her husband, Sheila Morgan.

1245
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:54,963
The prosecuting attorney
 refused to comment on the verdict,

1246
01:18:55,163 --> 01:18:58,467
but the New York state governor
 called for Miss Morgan's resignation

1247
01:18:58,467 --> 01:19:01,536
and issued a formal apology
 to Eleanor Jordan.

1248
01:19:01,703 --> 01:19:06,141
District Attorney Sheila Morgan issued
 a statement saying she would not resign.

1249
01:19:45,247 --> 01:19:59,628
Three. Nearing. The EC is serrate.

1250
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:09,104
You will find someone from the Ellen.

1251
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:20,282
I cork kings, queens.

1252
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:30,559
Mercy Covid. Must be

1253
01:20:30,592 --> 01:20:36,298
free. Machine called.

1254
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:53,982
Miss. Left. Raging.

1255
01:20:59,988 --> 01:21:07,462
Mean like your people. Twist.

1256
01:21:11,466 --> 01:21:13,501
And the world of golf.

1257
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:20,141
And you shake and you sweat,

1258
01:21:21,509 --> 01:22:07,355
gravlax and you all get. Got something?

1259
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:17,699
I mean, ask him. Can't, can't.

1260
01:22:33,581 --> 01:22:45,226
But CEO. Break. Have mercy on Charlie.
