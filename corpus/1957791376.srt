You gotta be more responsible.

spent the last year in Barcelona.

with that whole Mandarin thing?

274

She's been taking Mandarin
for, like, six months.

- Yes.

I think it is. She says it every morning.
And what do you mean, "Where was I going?"

280
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,458

- Armando? What about Armando?

"What do I mean"?

but it's too bad you can't go.

297

I mean, come on, you guys were so close.

298
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,746
And you know you used to have
the best time together.

299
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,500
Yes, Maya, we did, and then I grew up.

300
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,625
That's what happens in life.
I got married. I had kids.

301
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,809
I'm sorry that I don't wanna spend
a weekend with Huck

302
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,458
celebrating his 44th birthday
with a bunch of 22-year-olds.

303
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:29,083
- All right, fine.
- [Sonny] Thank you.

304
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,976
- Let's get back to this Armando thing.
- Babe, there's no Armando thing.

305
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,291
Why'd he have his hand
on your shoulder for six seconds?

306
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:37,291
- Did you count?
- It was six seconds. I counted.

307
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:38,791
Right above your collarbone.

308
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,500
And by the way, it bothered me
because you have a high breast.

309
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,666
What?

310
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,750
Because of your high breast,
if his hand got lower,

311
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:45,791
he's grabbing titty.

312
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,625
It was my shoulder.

313
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,458
- I think you're really overreacting.
- No! No, I'm not!

314
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:53,333
Think I don't see his games?
I see right through him.

315
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,416
- We're in a chess match.
- A chess match?

316
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,541
Yes. You can't see it
because you're not a guy.

317
00:12:57,625 --> 00:13:00,541
- Okay. All right.
- Maya, I'm very serious.

318
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,208
It's a guy thing.

319
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:06,041
I still can't believe that I didn't know
Ava was taking Mandarin.

320
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,500
I feel like the worst mom ever.

321
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:12,208
You know what you need? You just need
some quality time with the kids.

322
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,791
Oh, look.

323
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,333
- [Sonny] What?
- Look at this.

324
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,625
"Thank you for coming." See that?

325
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,916
Armando just sent that text. See?

326
00:13:21,416 --> 00:13:23,041
Oh, wait, was that some kind of…

327
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,958
[scoffs] … "move" in the chess match?

328
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,750
- It actually was.
- [phone chimes]

329
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,291
What is that?

330
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:32,666
He sent you a… a GIF from <i>Bridger ton</i>?

331
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,559
I'm not gonna make a big deal out of it,
but I think it's inappropriate.

332
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,791
- Right? That's just… just me saying.
- I don't think he meant anything by it.

333
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:42,041
You know, that's, uh…
that's actually next on our watch list.

334
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,583
<i>Bridger ton</i>?
I can't wait to see it, either.

335
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:48,000
You know, I might have binged it
with Armando on our flight to New York.

336
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,333
Are you kidding me right now?

337
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:50,750
We put it on our watch list.

338
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:53,041
- I know.
- That means we're watching it together.

339
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:56,250
You know what I watched instead of that?
<i>Storage Wars</i>. Reruns.

340
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,142
- Wow.
- I can't get that piece of my life back.

341
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:01,000
- Baby, I'm so sorry. I don't… I… I...
- Ooh, that's insane.

342
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:03,166
You know what?

343
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,708
I actually have an idea.

344
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,791
All right, I accept your apology.

345
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:11,375
No, listen, I want to tell you.

346
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:15,208
- What do you mean, tell me? Come on.
- No, but I want to tell you what it is.

347
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,166
- Go back to the side.
- Yeah. No, baby.

348
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,291
- I can last longer from the side.
- That's good.

349
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,726
- Can I tell you something first?
- All right, well, hurry up.

350
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,916
Okay, I'm thinking maybe
I should take Dash and Ava

351
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
for spring break, but by myself.

352
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,791
- What?
- Yeah, I need quality time with the kids.

353
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,833
- Maya…
- You could use time without them.

354
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,458
You know, you could stay here
and have a week to yourself.

355
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,791
You've never traveled
with them without me.

356
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,166
I am their mother.

357
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,666
- I know. I get that.
- Sonny? Hello? I will be fine.

358
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,666
[laughs] I mean, come on.
Just think about it.

359
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,416
- Okay. I'll… I'll think about it.
- Okay.

360
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,708
- All right?
- Yeah.

361
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,250
Now, I need to know what I'm doing.

362
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:53,666
Are these pants staying down,
or they coming up?

363
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,083
- Down.
- Oh.

364
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,513
[Alan] Sonny, what is there
to think about?

365
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:02,750
A week without their family
is literally every man's dream.

366
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:06,541
[scoff] Every man's dream?
Alan, you don't think moms need a break?

367
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,791
I'm working full-time
at the real estate agency

368
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,375
and still expected to do
everything with these kids.

369
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:14,458
Okay, first of all, Jill, you and Hank,
you share custody, all right?

370
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,822
So it's not like
you don't have time for yourself. You do.

371
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,291
No, I don't,
'cause this bitch talking about,

372
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,375
"Oh, I'm on a business
trip every other weekend,"

373
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,208
when I know he's just doing CrossFit.

374
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:27,750
Okay? And now I only get one day a month
to stack up all my Tinder dates.

375
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:28,833
And how's that going?

376
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,500
I mean, I'm fucking,

377
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:33,208
but you know, I don't have time
to develop anything meaningful.

378
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:34,684
- Right. Yeah, no connection.
- Whoa!

379
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:36,041
Just getting smashed to pieces.

380
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:39,333
God, I wish Jeremiah would take
the twins from me for the weekend.

381
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:42,708
I haven't been alone
in my house in like a decade.

382
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:43,875
Hey, Stew.

383
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:47,041
Right, you know, talking about "me time,"

384
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,625
- there's value in it.
- Big-time.

385
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:51,208
But is it really worth
missing a family vacation?

386
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,875
You have no life outside of your kids.

387
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,500
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

388
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:57,309
Sonny, ignore them. There's nothing
wrong with being a devoted parent.

389
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:59,958
Bethany, come on,
you're basically your children's butler.

390
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:02,208
Diane and I have our routine dialed in.

391
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,291
I'm the caregiver,
and she's the breadwinner.

392
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,833
We both know our roles,
so there's zero conflict.

393
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:09,041
It's called a system, which works, guys.

394
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,642
- Right? That's good for you guys.
- A prison system, sounds like.

395
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:12,791
I like my life.

396
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:16,208
- Shut up, Bethany. You do not.
- What is this, Sonny, no everything's?

397
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,691
What are you doing right now, Alan?

398
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,208
Are you really putting
your hand on every bagel?

399
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:21,583
Trying to find the everything's.

400
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:25,208
Every single Café Friday, Alan,
you complain about everything,

401
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,375
yet you bring nothing.

402
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:27,625
Me, on the other hand,

403
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,291
I'm putting the presentation together.

404
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:30,375
I'm putting this out.

405
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:33,138
'Cause this is all you focus on.
You need to let Maya take the kids.

406
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,541
- Can you let it go?
- You have to.

407
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,625
I'm worried you'll turn
into Crossing Guard Lenore.

408
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:37,788
What are you talking about?

409
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,000
You're turning into Lenore
whether you know it or not.

410
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,833
[Sonny] Okay, I just happen to love
Crossing Guard Lenore.

411
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,517
- We all do. It's sad.
- What's your point?

412
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,642
Her kids went to this school.
She was a full-time mom,

413
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,666
director of the talent show,
head of the PTA.

414
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,750
She had no life outside of this place.

415
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,166
Does that sound familiar to you?

416
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,625
Yeah, well, her husband leaves her,
kids don't need her anymore,

417
00:16:57,125 --> 00:17:00,708
and one day out of nowhere,
she just shows up with the vest on.

418
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,625
Crossing guard's not even
an official position, Sonny.

419
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,500
[pensive music playing]

420
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,708
- It's not?
- No, it's not.

421
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:10,666
I know.

422
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,166
- I'm becoming Crossing Guard Lenore.
- [Alan] Yeah.

423
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,916
- That's it, I'm staying home.
- Really?

424
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,166
- Yeah, really.
- Yes!

425
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,041
Okay, you're gonna need
a Sherpa next week, so I am telling Rita

426
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,416
she's taking the kids
to Legoland by herself.

427
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,980
Are you sure she's gonna go for that?

428
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:30,041
Are you kidding me?
I rule the roost, pal. I'm not like you.

429
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,291
All right, so what's on the agenda?
Let's do this.

430
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,708
How about we… how about we start off
with some golf, right?

431
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,083
- Yeah.
- Some food.

432
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,875
Maybe find an underground barbecue spot.

433
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,833
Or we go to a gentleman's cabaret.

434
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:42,875
- Absolutely not. No.
- Yes.

435
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,875
Don't you wanna get smashed
between something?

436
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,642
- No. Not that.
- What are you talking about?

437
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,306
You don't go to titty bars, a strip club?

438
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,125
- No, I do not. And it...
- Why?

439
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,708
Because it makes me feel
as if I'm… as if I'm cheating.

440
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,708
- It's not cheating.
- Ah, it is.

441
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:57,666
No, it's harmless flirtation
with a professional body worker.

442
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,208
- No.
- Where do you masturbate?

443
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:00,750
- I'm sorry?
- Where do you jerk off?

444
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:03,583
- No. Ah, good to see you.
- She does too.

445
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,266
- You're out of line.
- Tell me on three.

446
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,142
- I'm not telling you anything.
- One, two, three.

447
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,166
- Shower.
- I knew it.

448
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,791
- You didn't say it. You repeated it.
- Yes, I did.

449
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,835
You're relegated
to jerking off in a watery prison

450
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,708
because your family is always home.

451
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:17,833
The freedom, Sonny, to have yourself
in any room in your house,

452
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,083
that's why we fight wars.

453
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,166
Okay.

454
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:22,250
"I bought this house.
I'm gonna jerk off in it!"

455
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,413
- Right? You deserve that!
- Right! Yeah, no, no. No.

456
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:26,208
- I do deserve it. Yes!
- Yes, you do!

457
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,851
This is gonna be revolutionary, baby.
We're gonna be real friends!

458
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:31,916
Whoa! Wait, what do you mean,
"We're gonna be"? We are friends, dude.

459
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,250
- We're parent friends.
- I've known you for seven years.

460
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,500
You're saved in my phone as "Dash's Dad."

461
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,684
- What do you mean?
- I didn't know your name for three years.

462
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,583
When we become friends, I'll change it.

463
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:41,833
Okay, water under the bridge,

464
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:43,958
you're right about everything.
You got me pumped up!

465
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,750
- Let's go!
- I get some me time.

466
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,059
- You time.
- It's about me time!

467
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,458
- Me time!
- Me time!

468
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,916
Mom, Mom, do you think
Grandma and Grandpa have Wi-Fi?

469
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,958
Yes, I'm sure they do, baby.
I'm sure. Just go get your stuff.

470
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,708
- Come on, we're gonna miss our flight.
- Dash, forgot your keys.

471
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,151
Come on, Dad. We packed carry-ons,

472
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,168
and now we're gonna have to wait
at baggage claim?

473
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:02,750
Come on, son, now you know
you got to nail this talent show.

474
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:05,375
All I'm asking for is
20 minutes a day. You got that.

475
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:08,791
I bet all the other kids are practicing
during vacation. Here, Maya.

476
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,166
- Wait, what is this?
- Ava's EpiPen.

477
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,000
- Ep... Oh my G...
- Yes.

478
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:17,250
- Oh God! How could I forget this?
- What are you talking about?

479
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,791
There's one in the backpack.
I just keep a spare one on me.

00:41:36,666 --> 00:41:38,583
He just suggested that I leave my job

967
00:41:38,666 --> 00:41:43,750
and… and open my own firm,
you know, uh, with him as my first client.

968
00:41:43,833 --> 00:41:45,166
[Sonny] <i>Oh! Oh, there you go.</i>

969
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,833
Last suggestion I remember

970
00:41:46,916 --> 00:41:49,392
was you telling me that you
wanted to spend time with the kids.

971
00:41:49,416 --> 00:41:51,375
<i>Now I find out that you're island hopping</i>

972
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:52,875
- <i>with old Don Dental…</i>
- Please.

973
00:41:52,958 --> 00:41:54,833
- Be nice.
- …<i>going all over the place...</i>

974
00:41:54,916 --> 00:41:57,250
- Sonny, it's Gil.
- Oh shit.

975
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:59,541
- [Gil] <i>You have to understand something.</i>
- Here we go.

976
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:01,125
Maya is the breadwinner,

977
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:03,291
and your job
is to hold down the home front.

978
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:06,250
Now, I love you, buddy,
but you got to stay in your lane.

979
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:09,416
You know what, Gil? I doubt
that I'm gonna take relationship advice,

980
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,125
or any type of advice
for that matter, from a cheater.

981
00:42:12,208 --> 00:42:13,976
- What?
- [Sonny]<i> That's right. From a cheater!</i>

982
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,500
- What?
- Who did Grandpa cheat with?

983
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:17,625
I have never cheated in my life!

984
00:42:17,708 --> 00:42:19,468
Want me to take you
back to last summer, huh?

985
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:20,875
Orcas Island Golf Course?

986
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:23,291
You gave yourself
every putt within six feet.

987
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:26,351
- He's talking about golf. So dumb.
- [Sonny] <i>Newsflash, those are not gimmes!</i>

988
00:42:26,375 --> 00:42:27,583
They're not gimmes, Pops!

989
00:42:27,666 --> 00:42:32,083
It's not my fault you don't have the balls
to tell me to putt out, you pussy.

990
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:34,291
- [Sonny] <i>Oh, I don't have the balls?</i>
- Okay, Maya...

991
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:36,875
- [Maya] Okay.
- Let me tell you something about my balls!

992
00:42:36,958 --> 00:42:40,291
Let me tell you something
about my big black balls.

993
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:43,215
- I'm out. Take the phone, girl.
- [Sonny] <i>I fought off a mountain lion!</i>

994
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:46,166
You're not done 'cause I'm not done,
so pick up the phone. Gil?

995
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:50,875
- We're gonna tell you good night, honey.
- Maya, give Gil back the phone!

996
00:42:50,958 --> 00:42:52,250
[phone line beeping]

997
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:54,625
[electronic dance music playing]

998
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:59,000
You don't have no balls.

999
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:05,416
Hey, Sonny.

1000
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,166
Where you been, buddy?

1001
00:43:07,666 --> 00:43:09,208
I was up there on the phone with Maya.

1002
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:10,958
- I had to go find reception.
- Really?

1003
00:43:11,041 --> 00:43:12,666
I call to check on her.

1004
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,950
I'm thinking she's with the kids,
spending quality time.

1005
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,281
She's with her parents,
what she was supposed to be doing.

1006
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:18,916
I find out her client Armando's there.

1007
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,708
I find that out 'cause Dash told me.

1008
00:43:20,791 --> 00:43:22,916
And her dad called me a pussy.

1009
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,041
- Whoa. None of that right now.
- I never... I'm not a pussy. I'm...

1010
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:27,000
Just calm down.

1011
00:43:27,083 --> 00:43:28,875
- Yeah, I...
- Take a breath. Recenter.

1012
00:43:28,958 --> 00:43:30,416
- Yeah.
- You're not with Maya.

1013
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,041
- You're not with the kids.
- Yeah.

1014
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:35,041
- You're here in the desert with me.
- Yeah.

1015
00:43:35,125 --> 00:43:36,666
[inhales deeply]

1016
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:39,666
There you go. Recenter.

1017
00:43:40,291 --> 00:43:41,416
Oh, hell, yes.

1018
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,208
Sonny, you're gonna lose your mind

1019
00:43:43,291 --> 00:43:45,416
when you see the surprise guest
I pulled out of a hat.

1020
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,041
- You got a surprise guest?
- I got a surprise guest.

1021
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,875
For you. They're a little early,
but you're gonna love it.

1022
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:52,875
- Who is it? Tell me.
- You're gonna love it.

1023
00:43:53,666 --> 00:43:55,541
[ominous music playing]

1024
00:43:55,625 --> 00:43:56,666
Ay-yi-yi.

1025
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:00,000
Huck, my man. I texted you.
You've been ghosting me.

1026
00:44:00,083 --> 00:44:03,541
No! No, I've just been slammed
planning this party. It's my 44th.

1027
00:44:03,625 --> 00:44:06,958
Not to burst your bubble,
but that's not a milestone of any kind.

1028
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:09,666
And if it wasn't for your friend here
posting you on the 'gram,

1029
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,750
I would've never found out
where you were hiding.

1030
00:44:11,833 --> 00:44:13,333
I would not hide from you.

1031
00:44:13,416 --> 00:44:16,208
Wait a minute, am I missing something?
Is this the surprise?

1032
00:44:16,291 --> 00:44:17,875
Allow me to do the intros.

1033
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:20,291
Stan Berman,
alternative revenue specialist.

1034
00:44:20,375 --> 00:44:23,666
- And this is my colleague, Dorit.
- Shalom.

1035
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:26,833
Shalom back at you. I'm, uh, Sonny Fisher.

1036
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:30,416
So, Huck, when I saw
you were throwing this elaborate shindig

1037
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,291
even though you still owe me $47,000,

1038
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:35,791
I thought Dorit and I
will have to come pay you a visit.

1039
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:38,416
No, I... Look, I've been having
some liquidity issues.

1040
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:39,833
Stan offered to spot me.

1041
00:44:39,916 --> 00:44:40,791
- It's all good.
- Okay.

1042
00:44:40,875 --> 00:44:42,541
I didn't spot you, Huck.

1043
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:46,125
I loaned you the money,
and you refused to pay me back.

1044
00:44:46,208 --> 00:44:50,208
So now, Dorit's gonna have to inflict
some bodily harm.

1045
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:54,083
Stan. Stan. Stan the Man.
Hey, I thought we were friends.

1046
00:44:54,166 --> 00:44:57,833
We are, but Huck, I was very clear
about my fee structure.

1047
00:44:57,916 --> 00:45:01,333
It's a misunderstanding.
I did not know this was so time-sensitive.

1048
00:45:01,416 --> 00:45:03,750
Give me a day.
I'll move some funds around.

1049
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:04,750
I'll pay you back.

1050
00:45:04,833 --> 00:45:06,041
Oy vey.

1051
00:45:06,125 --> 00:45:07,875
- A day?
- Yeah.

1052
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
All right, fine.

1053
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:11,583
- Oh my God.
- Yes, thank you!

1054
00:45:11,666 --> 00:45:13,767
- He's so reasonable.
- I didn't know what was going on.

1055
00:45:13,791 --> 00:45:15,751
- I'm panicking right now.
- Don't sever anything.

1056
00:45:15,833 --> 00:45:17,713
Just break a finger,
then we gotta hit the road.

1057
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:20,541
Wait, what are you talking about?
We had a deal. You gave me a day.

1058
00:45:20,625 --> 00:45:22,745
You just said that it was okay.
We heard you say that.

1059
00:45:22,791 --> 00:45:25,833
But, Huck, would you really feel
the pressure to pay me back

1060
00:45:25,916 --> 00:45:27,583
without some physical violence?

1061
00:45:27,666 --> 00:45:29,809
- I wouldn't with the same immediacy.
- That's my point.

1062
00:45:29,833 --> 00:45:32,625
You guys are in good hands.
Don't worry, Dorit's incredibly precise.

1063
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:34,666
Fingers on the wood, please.

1064
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:36,250
Huck, wait… wait a minute.

1065
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,142
- Don't put your hand there.
- She said I have...

1066
00:45:38,166 --> 00:45:40,750
- Here we...
- Hey, listen, D… Do… What… what is it?

1067
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:44,500
It's Dorit. Like "Dorito" without the "o."
Come on, man, pull it together.

1068
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:47,017
Hey! Don't! Wait! He's gonna say
something important, I think.

1069
00:45:47,041 --> 00:45:48,921
- Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
- [shouts] What?

1070
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I can't let this happen
because I feel responsible.

1071
00:45:51,041 --> 00:45:54,875
No, Sonny, this is not your fault.
I'm not letting you take responsibility.

1072
00:45:54,958 --> 00:45:56,875
You're the responsible party?

1073
00:45:56,958 --> 00:46:00,333
Yes, my picture is what brought you here.

1074
00:46:01,375 --> 00:46:02,458
- Okay.
- Yes!

1075
00:46:02,541 --> 00:46:04,421
- Dorit. Oh, I love you! Thank you.
- Thank you.

1076
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,916
You're so sweet.
I told you she was really nice.

1077
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,666
Way more understanding than him.

1078
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:11,375
- [shouts]
- [screaming]

1079
00:46:11,458 --> 00:46:12,625
Oh my God!

1080
00:46:12,708 --> 00:46:15,250
- Whoa! Why is the little one screaming?
- [Sonny screaming]

1081
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:17,000
He said he was responsible.

1082
00:46:17,083 --> 00:46:19,750
I said I was responsible
for bringing you here, Diggit.

1083
00:46:19,833 --> 00:46:20,916
Dorit! Dorit!

1084
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,541
"Dorit." I don't give a shit!

1085
00:46:22,625 --> 00:46:23,458
Damn!

1086
00:46:23,541 --> 00:46:25,875
Dorit, you have to run these things by me.

1087
00:46:25,958 --> 00:46:27,333
He said responsible!

1088
00:46:27,416 --> 00:46:30,583
Oh my God. That is disgusting.
It looks like a hot Cheeto.

1089
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:35,416
I am so sorry, Sonny, but look,
we got a finger, right? We're good.

1090
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,125
Dorit, would you please
go burn down the campsite?

1091
00:46:38,208 --> 00:46:40,208
- Or do you want me to supervise that too?
- What?

1092
00:46:40,291 --> 00:46:42,892
You said you got your finger.
Why you gonna burn down the campsite?

1093
00:46:42,916 --> 00:46:45,416
Huck, you built
a massive effigy of yourself

1094
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:46,916
while you're deeply indebted to me.

1095
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,083
How do you think
that reflects on my business?

1096
00:46:49,791 --> 00:46:51,041
The party's over buddy, okay?

1097
00:46:51,125 --> 00:46:53,000
Just get your stuff together
and pay me back.

1098
00:46:53,083 --> 00:46:55,309
- Oh my God, Huck.
- [Huck] She's not really gonna do that.

1099
00:46:55,333 --> 00:46:56,708
[Stan] I'm sorry again, Sonny.

1100
00:46:56,791 --> 00:46:59,916
I promise you, Dorit's a delight
when you get to know her.

1101
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,416
We're trying to party!

1102
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,791
- Oh!
- Ooh.

1103
00:47:02,875 --> 00:47:05,833
- Party's over! Go home!
- No, not the effigy!

1104
00:47:05,916 --> 00:47:07,541
[Dorit screams]

1105
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:09,791
We weren't gonna burn that till Thursday!

1106
00:47:10,916 --> 00:47:13,625
Everybody stay calm… but run!

1107
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:16,000
Don't worry. Hey! Hey!

1108
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,791
Now you owe me $47,000 and an iPhone.

1109
00:47:19,416 --> 00:47:20,625
[splutters] What?

1110
00:47:21,666 --> 00:47:22,791
Hey, guys.

1111
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:24,916
I'm so sorry.

1112
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,791
This is a bit of a misunderstanding.
Actually, it's a bookkeeping issue really.

1113
00:47:29,333 --> 00:47:31,625
Clearly, this is not
how I wanted the week to end.

1114
00:47:32,291 --> 00:47:34,375
Geno will get you safely back to LA.

1115
00:47:34,458 --> 00:47:35,291
Next time.

1116
00:47:35,375 --> 00:47:37,041
- We had fun.
- [in Italian] Thank you.

1117
00:47:37,125 --> 00:47:39,226
- It's nothing.
- [in English] We'll party next weekend.

1118
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:41,833
You said Geno
will get you safely back to LA.

1119
00:47:42,583 --> 00:47:44,125
- You're not coming?
- [man] All right.

1120
00:47:44,208 --> 00:47:46,750
No, I should see
if there's anything salvageable.

1121
00:47:46,833 --> 00:47:48,083
I'll just call an Uber.

1122
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,125
Party was still fire, brother.

1123
00:47:51,208 --> 00:47:53,250
Not the best time to use the word "fire."

1124
00:47:53,333 --> 00:47:55,791
- I just meant like...
- I understand the sentiment.

1125
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:57,958
[woman] Bye, Huck!

1126
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:01,166
If you want, man, I don't…
I don't mind sticking around

1127
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,833
and… and helping you
look through all this stuff.

1128
00:48:03,916 --> 00:48:06,833
No, no, Sonny, you've done enough.
I feel horrible about your finger.

1129
00:48:06,916 --> 00:48:08,916
Come on. You tell me…
you tell me where to go.

1130
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,059
We could start... You wanna start here?

1131
00:48:11,083 --> 00:48:13,833
You wanna start with the stuff
that's not still on fire, maybe?

1132
00:48:13,916 --> 00:48:15,208
Maybe still smoking?

1133
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:17,333
Bye, guys!

1134
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:20,625
[groans] Oh my God.

1135
00:48:21,416 --> 00:48:24,333
My YETIs melted.
That's 2,500 I'll never get back.

1136
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:26,875
You spent 2,500 on coolers, Huck?

1137
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:30,125
Why would you spend that
on coolers when you're in the hole?

1138
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:31,916
I don't know what's wrong with me.

1139
00:48:32,541 --> 00:48:34,708
It's much bigger than YETIs,
I can tell you that.

1140
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:37,500
The truth is,
I didn't leave the ad agency, Sonny.

1141
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:38,583
I got fired.

1142
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,833
- You got what?
- I got fired.

1143
00:48:40,916 --> 00:48:42,125
I take a client out to dinner,

1144
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:45,166
somehow, we'd end up
on a bender in San Miguel de Allende.

1145
00:48:45,708 --> 00:48:47,833
HR caught on and was like,
"Ah, no. Hello!"

1146
00:48:47,916 --> 00:48:50,416
They don't wanna pay $17,000 for a dinner.

1147
00:48:52,333 --> 00:48:55,250
I tried to start my own firm,
but I couldn't even get past Quick Books.

1148
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:57,666
I spiraled.
These parties got out of control.

1149
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:59,958
It was an attempt
to stave off my loneliness.

1150
00:49:00,041 --> 00:49:01,958
If you needed help,
why didn't you just call me?

1151
00:49:02,041 --> 00:49:04,458
I did. I called. I texted you.

1152
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:06,341
Every time I hit you up,
you just blew me off.

1153
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:10,041
And I get it, all right? I took the hint.
You're onto this beautiful new chapter.

1154
00:49:10,125 --> 00:49:13,125
There was no time for me
getting in the way. I understand.

1155
00:49:13,208 --> 00:49:14,791
No, no, Huck.

1156
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:17,500
You would call me
at eleven o'clock at night to go out.

1157
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:19,000
I'm in bed by nine.

1158
00:49:19,083 --> 00:49:20,666
And not to mention, if I do go out,

1159
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:23,666
what am I gonna talk about
with a… a… a beekeeper?

1160
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:26,333
That's not my world.
I build Legos, I wipe ass.

1161
00:49:26,416 --> 00:49:28,041
Sonny, you're crushing it.

1162
00:49:28,125 --> 00:49:31,083
You support a brilliant woman.
You raised two amazing kids.

1163
00:49:31,166 --> 00:49:33,250
Anyone would kill for your life.

1164
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
You wouldn't.

1165
00:49:36,375 --> 00:49:37,416
Are you kidding me?

1166
00:49:38,125 --> 00:49:39,125
That's my dream.

1167
00:49:39,916 --> 00:49:41,833
I'm just on more of a Clooney plan.

1168
00:49:41,916 --> 00:49:43,583
What does that… what does that mean?

1169
00:49:43,666 --> 00:49:47,041
George Timothy Clooney?
The world's most eligible bachelor?

1170
00:49:47,125 --> 00:49:49,291
The guy rode singledom into his 50s.

1171
00:49:49,375 --> 00:49:51,208
Then he married Amal, had the twins,

1172
00:49:51,291 --> 00:49:53,500
became a family man
without ever missing a beat.

1173
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:56,500
- The Clooney plan.
- No, I get it. I understand.

1174
00:49:56,583 --> 00:49:59,041
Look, I'm sorry that I blew you off, man.

1175
00:49:59,791 --> 00:50:02,500
I am. And I… and I hate
that it took this long to talk.

1176
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:03,833
Right?

1177
00:50:03,916 --> 00:50:05,458
It's okay. We're talking now.

1178

Water under the bridge. You're right.

1182
00:50:14,875 --> 00:50:15,875
I'm sorry, man.

- What?

1184
00:50:18,458 --> 00:50:19,916
The raw bar, untouched.

1185
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,250
Sonny, this is a sign.

1186
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:23,892
- Things are looking up.
- What do you...

1187
00:50:23,916 --> 00:50:25,500
Let's bag these up and get out of here.

1188
00:50:25,583 --> 00:50:27,583
No way I'm leaving
four grand of shellfish behind.

1189
00:50:27,666 --> 00:50:29,375
You spent four grand on shellfish?

1190
00:50:30,541 --> 00:50:33,166
[woman] Oh my God. It stinks in here.

1191
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:36,130
I never would've picked you guys up
if I knew y'all were moving mollusks.

1192
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:39,791
I'm so sorry, Thelma, but it was like
God himself told me to take these oysters.

1193
00:50:39,875 --> 00:50:41,958
- You gotta be kidding me.
- What?

1194
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:44,833
Topanga, the next exit coming up.

1195
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,208
It's Armando's.

1196
00:50:46,291 --> 00:50:49,250
That's where
the old Toothbrush King himself lives.

1197
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:51,500
- It's this chess match that he and I got.
- Of course.

1198
00:50:51,583 --> 00:50:54,500
- I make a move, he...
- I gotta get eyes on this guy.

1199
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:56,166

- Let me see him.

Okay, that's enough.
Please. Give me my pho...

- [Thelma] I did. [chuckles] Gorgeous.

1207
00:51:16,958 --> 00:51:20,875
- Sonny, these moguls, they're predators.
- What?

1208
00:51:20,958 --> 00:51:23,125
He's going after your family.
You gotta go after his.

1209
00:51:23,208 --> 00:51:25,583
- Well...
- Does he have a wife? A girlfriend?

1210
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:26,750
I'd be down. I mean, what?

1211
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,934
I'd hate to be a home-wrecker,
but I'll do it for you.

1212
00:51:28,958 --> 00:51:30,875
- Okay.
- You give me a week, I'll seduce her.

00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:33,875
You know what?

1214
00:51:35,583 --> 00:51:36,583
He does.

1215
00:51:38,125 --> 00:51:39,916
- Hey, get off at this exit.
- Right here?

1216
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,208

but there's no way I'm fucking a tortoise.

1220
00:51:51,458 --> 00:51:55,666
- You just said you'd fuck a tortoise?
- No, I'm not asking you to do that, Huck.

1221
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:58,083
The guy refers to these things
as his family.

1222
00:51:58,166 --> 00:52:01,583
Right? So what I'm thinking,
I'm thinking we grab it, set it free.

1223
00:52:01,666 --> 00:52:03,666
Let it outside the gate, right?

1224
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:05,470

gets back from San Juan,

this thing could be anywhere.

1226
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:09,333
- Yeah, he's gonna be devastated.
- He's gonna be pissed off.

1227
00:52:09,416 --> 00:52:12,256
[grunts] These tortoises are a lot heavier
than what you think they are.

1228
00:52:12,333 --> 00:52:14,458
- We have one.
- When did you get a tortoise?

1229
00:52:14,541 --> 00:52:16,958
Well, basically the kids' preschool,

1230
00:52:17,041 --> 00:52:19,000
they made us take one
for the summer, right?

1231
00:52:19,083 --> 00:52:21,416
Kids fell in love with it.
I don't even understand how.

1232
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:22,750
They're so emotionless.

1233
00:52:22,833 --> 00:52:25,375
It's, like, not a good pet at all.
They don't respond.

1234
00:52:25,458 --> 00:52:27,000
They don't really do anything.

1235

There you go.
The world is yours. Go, buddy.

1236
00:52:29,666 --> 00:52:32,000
- Yeah, he's getting some momentum now.
- Yeah, he is.

1237
00:52:32,083 --> 00:52:34,333
- This is so stupid.
- [Huck] Go. Hee-yah!

1238
00:52:38,708 --> 00:52:40,508
I gotta be honest,
I'm having second thoughts.

1239
00:52:40,541 --> 00:52:43,583
I just had a visual
of this guy crossing the 405, and he…

1240
00:52:43,666 --> 00:52:44,750
He don't stand a chance.

1241
00:52:44,833 --> 00:52:46,083
- Oh, thank God.
- Yeah.

1242
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:47,583
God, I was feeling the same thing,

1243
00:52:47,666 --> 00:52:49,546
but you were on a roll,
so I kept my mouth shut.

1244
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:54,041
[grunts] I like the feeling of knowing
that we could have did this to Armando.

1245
00:52:54,125 --> 00:52:56,059
- Wait, wait, wait, put him down.
- What? [grunts]

1246
00:52:56,083 --> 00:52:57,750
- Hold on a second here.
- What?

What? I'm talking
to the Big Dog right now.

we may as well mess with his house, right?

00:53:05,875 --> 00:53:07,958

- Yeah, I'm the Big Dog.

- I'm not a bitch.

1286
00:54:31,833 --> 00:54:34,166
I'm gonna take
all your left shoes, Armando.

1287
00:54:37,083 --> 00:54:38,125
[laughs evilly]

1288
00:54:38,625 --> 00:54:41,500
- Big Dog, did you drop it like it's hot?
- Hell, yeah, I did.

1289
00:54:41,583 --> 00:54:44,083
[Huck] That's it?
It's like a hotel pillow mint.

1290
00:54:44,166 --> 00:54:46,851
Yeah. Well, I mean, I had already went
to the bathroom in the desert.

1291
00:54:46,875 --> 00:54:50,041
I didn't have much left to work with,
but I pushed that out. [grunts]

1292
00:54:50,541 --> 00:54:51,916
[dishes breaking]

1293
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,708
[screaming and laughing maniacally]

1294
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,916
No! Whoa, whoa!
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1295
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,250
We're not doing this.

1296
00:54:59,333 --> 00:55:03,000
We're doing harmless stuff
that's still got some bad intent to it.

1297
00:55:03,083 --> 00:55:03,958
Not this.

1298
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:06,083
- Well, don't you want to get back...
- [Sonny] No.

1299
00:55:06,166 --> 00:55:09,291
- Get into it? I'm doing this for you.
- No. Whoa... You're not.

1300
00:55:09,375 --> 00:55:12,000
So, don't break another plate.
Go wait in the car, please.

1301
00:55:12,083 --> 00:55:13,791
- Okay.
- [dishes breaking]

1302
00:55:14,291 --> 00:55:16,375
- I love the enthusiasm.
- Thank you.

1303
00:55:20,041 --> 00:55:22,708
[grunting] Whoo!

1304
00:55:24,458 --> 00:55:26,416
How you gonna pay Stan Berman back, man?

1305
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:27,833
I'm gonna flee the country.

1306
00:55:28,416 --> 00:55:30,125
- What?
- Look, Stan's a bad dude.

1307
00:55:30,208 --> 00:55:33,833
He's called The Butcher of Beverly Hills.
I heard he dumps bodies at the marina.

1308
00:55:33,916 --> 00:55:36,666
- Huck, that's insane.
- [Huck exhales]

1309
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,791
A buddy moved to Buenos Aires
to chase the tango.

1310
00:55:38,875 --> 00:55:40,208
He gets by for next to nothing.

1311
00:55:40,291 --> 00:55:42,125
I'll head down there,
lay low for a minute,

1312
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:43,688
funnel Stan some cash. It'll be fine.

1313
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:45,833
You're talking about leaving?
That's crazy.

1314
00:55:45,916 --> 00:55:48,416
I feel like Butch and Sundance
just got back together.

1315
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,060
We had one last day together.
It was the greatest day of my life.

1316
00:55:51,125 --> 00:55:53,666
The day doesn't have to be over.
We can keep the party going.

1317
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:57,541
Sonny, it's over. I'm couch surfing.
There's no place to move the party to.

1318
00:55:59,166 --> 00:56:00,583
Okay, what if there was a place?

1319
00:56:00,666 --> 00:56:02,541
- No.
- No. Call Geno.

1320
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:06,416
Tell Geno to take the bus to Sherman Oaks
'cause we're moving the party to my house.

1321
00:56:07,541 --> 00:56:11,000
All right, Huck-mobile's en route,
and I sent Kabir your house rules.

1322
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:12,416
- He's all good.
- This is so...

1323
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:16,416
Oh my God.
If this is a flat, you're paying.

1324
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:19,166
It's fine. I got… I got AAA.

1325
00:56:19,666 --> 00:56:22,208
Dude, when I tell you
this party's gonna be epic…

1326
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:23,625
- Yeah.
- …It's gonna be epic.

1327
00:56:23,708 --> 00:56:26,166
We're gonna send you out
with a bang, Huck. Watch.

1328
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:28,416
- [Thelma shouts indistinctly]
- With a big bang.

1329
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,125
- What the heck are you banging?
- Get out of the car right now!

1330
00:56:31,208 --> 00:56:32,583
You're gonna wanna see this.

1331
00:56:32,666 --> 00:56:36,041
- We said we'll pay. What is your problem?
- Look… look down!

1332
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:39,250
- Oh my God. Is it dead?
- I don't know.

1333
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:41,173
This is so bad.
It could've been 100 years old!

1334
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:44,000
- Oh my God!
- [Thelma] Isn't that, like, bad karma?

1335
00:56:44,083 --> 00:56:46,000
- It blinked. It blinked!
- [Sonny] What?

1336
00:56:46,083 --> 00:56:47,642
- You saw it blink?
- It's blinking now.

1337
00:56:47,666 --> 00:56:48,583
Oh, hi.

1338
00:56:48,666 --> 00:56:51,541
Listen, if it's blinking, that means
we got time to do the right thing.

1339
00:56:51,625 --> 00:56:54,875
All we gotta do is get it in the car,
get it to the animal hospital. That's it

1340
00:56:54,958 --> 00:56:59,791
[laughing] No, we are not putting
that mangled beast in my new Nissan.

1341
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:01,000
Thelma, be reasonable.

1342
00:57:01,083 --> 00:57:04,458
Can one injured turtle smell any worse
than 200 Little necks in your trunk?

1343
00:57:04,541 --> 00:57:07,666
Why are we not focusing on the problem?
Right now, it's not about you.

1344
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:08,875
Why are you in my face?

1345
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:10,958
- [Huck] Hey! Hey!
- You just shoved the Big Dog?

1346
00:57:11,041 --> 00:57:13,934
- What Big Dog, you little chihuahua?
- [Huck] He's a bigger dog than you.

1347
00:57:13,958 --> 00:57:16,208
Woof, woof, bitch. That's how you bark!

1348
00:57:16,291 --> 00:57:18,583
- We don't have the time. Come on.
- Load it up!

1349
00:57:18,666 --> 00:57:19,833
Get the turtle!

1350
00:57:19,916 --> 00:57:21,517
Make yourself... Get your ass in the car!

1351
00:57:21,541 --> 00:57:23,541
- Make yourself useful.
- Don't tell me what to do!

1352
00:57:24,416 --> 00:57:25,250
God.

1353
00:57:25,333 --> 00:57:27,053
- [Sonny] <i>Let's go!</i>
- [Huck and Sonny grunt]

1354
00:57:27,083 --> 00:57:28,708
[Thelma]<i> Oh my God. Be careful!</i>

1355
00:57:28,791 --> 00:57:31,791
- [Sonny] Shut up! You don't think we know?
- [Thelma] Obviously you don't.

1356
00:57:31,875 --> 00:57:33,583
[Sonny] Okay, what does it say to do?

1357
00:57:33,666 --> 00:57:34,583
[Huck] Cover the mouth.

1358
00:57:34,666 --> 00:57:38,583
Blow through the nose as hard as you can.
Wrap your lips around it.

1359
00:57:38,666 --> 00:57:39,666
Look at the picture!

1360
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:41,708
He's fighting it.
He's not letting it go down.

1361
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:45,166
I got it. I got it. [panting, gasping]

1362
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:47,125
- Yes. Yes!
- [blowing]

1363
00:57:47,208 --> 00:57:48,708
- More mouth.
- [spitting]

1364
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:50,831
I got turtle boogie.
I didn't know they had boogies.

1365
00:57:50,875 --> 00:57:51,791
[Thelma] Oh my God.

1366
00:57:51,875 --> 00:57:52,875
I got something in there.

1367
00:57:52,958 --> 00:57:54,750
- That is disgusting.
- Wake up!

1368
00:57:54,833 --> 00:57:57,333
Don't flick him! You have to gently grasp.

1369
00:57:57,416 --> 00:57:58,333
[panting, burping]

1370
00:57:58,416 --> 00:58:00,708
Cover his mouth and blow

1371
00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:03,208
slow, steady breaths into his nostril.

1372
00:58:03,291 --> 00:58:05,416
- [tires screeching]
- [Sonny grunts]

1373
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:07,666
- We're here, fools.
- [Sonny] Wait. Wait. What?

1374
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:10,000
- Stop! Stop! I said don't. I said do not.
- Got it.

1375
00:58:10,083 --> 00:58:12,333
Come on. Car, car, car.

1376
00:58:12,416 --> 00:58:15,625
- Slow down! We got an injured turtle here.
- [car horn honking]

1377
00:58:18,583 --> 00:58:19,916
- Hey, you got it?
- I got it.

1378
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:21,934
- [door buzzes]
- [horn honking]

1379
00:58:21,958 --> 00:58:25,041
Let's go, you idiots!

1380
00:58:27,625 --> 00:58:28,785
Hold on. Hold on. Wait, wait.

1381
00:58:28,833 --> 00:58:30,166
-Wait, wait, wait
-What?

1382
00:58:30,916 --> 00:58:33,583
Goddamn it. Did you do this?

1383
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,916
- [Huck and Sonny] No.
- Who did it?

1384
00:58:37,625 --> 00:58:39,416
Armando Zavala! Go!

1385
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,375
[Huck] Get him inside
before he dies, stupid.

1386
00:58:41,458 --> 00:58:42,541
[Sonny] Get it inside!

1387
00:58:42,625 --> 00:58:45,416
[Huck] Watch this. You think
Armando's gonna miss all his left shoes?

1388
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,125
[Sonny] That's so genius, Huck.

1389
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:51,791
You got to strike while the iron's hot.
Now, you got your little nest egg.

1390
00:58:51,875 --> 00:58:55,500
- You got your first client.
- Yes, but I need to talk to Sonny first.

1391
00:58:55,583 --> 00:58:58,250
He'll figure it out, now.
I don't see any issues.

1392
00:58:58,333 --> 00:59:00,875
- Oh, well, except the big issue.
- Which is?

1393
00:59:00,958 --> 00:59:04,000
Well, I barely see Dash and Ava as it is.

1394
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:07,291
If I start my own firm,
I'm never gonna be home.

1395
00:59:07,375 --> 00:59:10,500
If you want to be away from the kids
more than you already are,

1396
00:59:11,458 --> 00:59:12,750
I think you know the answer.

1397
00:59:12,833 --> 00:59:15,458
Here we go.
Thank you, Mom, for yet another reminder…

1398
00:59:15,541 --> 00:59:17,750
- No, I...
- …of what a neglectful mother I am.

1399
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:21,375
Honey, I'm jealous.

1400
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:23,500
I am jealous of you

1401
00:59:23,583 --> 00:59:26,500
because you have a partner
who helps you live your dreams.

1402
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
What is that supposed to mean, baby?

1403
00:59:29,083 --> 00:59:32,500
- You never helped me with these kids.
- You ought a stop.

1404
00:59:32,583 --> 00:59:36,250
I have a half-written erotic novel
that I never finished.

1405
00:59:36,333 --> 00:59:37,708
An erotic novel?

1406
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:40,875
- It's very sexual.
- How is that my fault?

1407
00:59:40,958 --> 00:59:46,208
Do you know how hard it is to write about
a man grabbing a woman by the titties…

1408
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:49,083
- Oh God, Mom!
- …knee-deep in dirty diapers?

1409
00:59:49,166 --> 00:59:53,541
Guys, this conversation has taken
a really uncomfortable and crazy turn,

1410
00:59:53,625 --> 00:59:56,875
but Mom, I do think I understand
where you're coming from.

1411
00:59:56,958 --> 00:59:57,833
Oh, thank you.

1412
00:59:57,916 --> 01:00:01,166
You know, the truth is,
if… if I were a dad making this decision,

1413
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:03,708
- this wouldn't even be a conversation.
- Mm-hmm.

1414
01:00:03,791 --> 01:00:07,583
And Sonny and I, what we do,
we make a great team.

1415
01:00:07,666 --> 01:00:08,833
I give you that.

1416
01:00:08,916 --> 01:00:10,083
I can do this.

1417
01:00:10,166 --> 01:00:11,166
Yes, you can.

1418
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:14,000
[laughs] Look, it's Armando.

1419
01:00:14,083 --> 01:00:18,708
Armando, your ears must have been ringing.
I literally just said your name.

1420
01:00:18,791 --> 01:00:21,208
- [Armando crying]
- Armando?

1421
01:00:21,291 --> 01:00:22,731
[Armando] <i>Sonny ran over Ole Snappy.</i>

1422
01:00:22,791 --> 01:00:25,208
- Wait, wait! Sonny did what?
- What'd Sonny do?

1423
01:00:25,291 --> 01:00:28,666
- Sonny just ran over Ole Snappy.
- Who the hell is Ole Snappy?

1424
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:32,541
- I don't know. Who's Ole Snappy?
- It's Armando's oldest tortoise.

1425
01:00:32,625 --> 01:00:35,375
Are they gonna put him in jail for this?
Can you see him now?

1426
01:00:35,458 --> 01:00:37,666
- He'd never be able to get a job.
- Turtle killer.

1427
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:38,583
Mmm.

1428
01:00:38,666 --> 01:00:40,666

1430
01:00:48,583 --> 01:00:50,416
[partyers laughing]

1431
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:53,666
- Hey, Thelma, we're a no-shoe household.
- That's so dumb.

1432
01:00:57,291 --> 01:00:58,708
Huck, who are all these people?

1433
01:00:59,333 --> 01:01:01,416
Oh, dude, I put
the bat call out on Instagram.

1434
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:04,226
Seems like you have a nice little turnout.
You get settled, all right?

1435
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:06,370
-Wait, wait
-Put these bad boys on ice. We'll be good.

1436
01:01:06,416 --> 01:01:09,416
- I thought it was just...
- Hey, the Big Dog is in the house!

1437
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,708
- Hey, what's up, man?
- What's popping, bro?

1438
01:01:11,791 --> 01:01:14,583
Hey, I got Huck's texts,
cordoned off all your kids' rooms

1439
01:01:14,666 --> 01:01:17,041
and made a sign
telling everybody to remove they shoes.

1440
01:01:17,125 --> 01:01:17,958
Yeah.

1441
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:22,166
But look, your TV
was paused on some '90s porn.

1442
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:23,708
I watched a little bit of it,

1443
01:01:23,791 --> 01:01:25,916
but it was so nice
that it had an actual plot.

1444
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,166
- Okay.
- [Alan] Sonny!

1445
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,958
- Hey. [chuckling]
- Alan?

1446
01:01:30,041 --> 01:01:31,976
- Alan, what are you doing here, man?
- [snorting]

1447
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,840
[coughs] I followed
your boy Huck on Instagram.

1448
01:01:33,875 --> 01:01:36,166
I saw the party moved to your place,
so I had to get here.

1449

- You drove from Legoland?

Rita's a deep sleeper.
She'll never know I'm gone.

1451
01:01:41,208 --> 01:01:43,848
The kids'll be up in the morning,
but I'll be back by then. I hope.

1452
01:01:44,666 --> 01:01:46,958
I'm just gonna ask, is that cocaine, man?

1453
01:01:47,041 --> 01:01:49,208
[laughing] What do you think this is,

1454
01:01:49,291 --> 01:01:50,875
No, this is my son's ADHD medication.

1455
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:52,250
How much of that have you done?

1456
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:55,613
A pretty good amount if I'm being honest.
I've done this before. Not my first time.

1457
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,833
- This is my first time.
- Okay.

1458
01:01:57,916 --> 01:01:59,434
- [inhales deeply]
- What you gonna do?

1459
01:01:59,458 --> 01:02:01,875
I've been lying to myself,
Sonny, for far too long.

1460
01:02:01,958 --> 01:02:03,916
You know? I… I… I do everything.

1461
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,160
You know, Rita,
she just bosses me around all the time.

1462
01:02:06,208 --> 01:02:08,125
I'm never alone.
I'm not going back to Legoland.

1463
01:02:08,208 --> 01:02:10,101
- I don't have to go back.
- I didn't say you did.

1464
01:02:10,125 --> 01:02:11,725
I'm not gonna 'cause I don't have to go.

1465
01:02:11,791 --> 01:02:13,666
- Okay.
- I'll be back before the kids wake up.

You're doing a shot with me, Mr. F.

No, please, Skyler, you don't have to.

1473
01:02:31,625 --> 01:02:33,666
Dude, are you okay?

1474
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,041
- No.
- What's the matter?

1475
01:02:35,125 --> 01:02:37,250
It starts with all these people
being in my house.

1476
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:39,392
- It's way more than I expected.
- More than I thought.

1477
01:02:39,416 --> 01:02:41,096
On top of that,
I've been drinking all day,

my head's spinning,
I smell like tortoise shit.

Not to mention, I don't even know
if the tortoise survived.

01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:56,291
I owe the man $47,000.

1600
01:07:56,375 --> 01:07:58,666
I know what you owe him, and I don't care.

1601
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:01,708
All right, look, we've always had
each other's backs, have we not?

1602
01:08:01,791 --> 01:08:02,831
- Of course.
- Have we not?

1603
01:08:02,875 --> 01:08:06,666
Okay, and I am a much better version
of myself when I'm with you.

1604
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:09,250
Now Maya and I,
we got some extra cash put away.

1605
01:08:09,333 --> 01:08:11,000
You gotta run this by her first.

1606
01:08:11,083 --> 01:08:14,041
Why? She didn't run
her business with Armando by me.

1607
01:08:14,125 --> 01:08:17,041
Now, I was thinking about
getting that 2022 Honda Odyssey,

1608
01:08:17,125 --> 01:08:19,750
but this is… this is
a much better use of my funds.

1609
01:08:19,833 --> 01:08:21,458
- Are you for real?
- Yes.

1610
01:08:21,541 --> 01:08:24,083
Oh my God, Sonny,
I was not looking forward to Argentina.

1611
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:25,926
And call Stan Berman
before I change my mind.

1612
01:08:27,041 --> 01:08:28,375
Come here. Call him.

1613
01:08:28,458 --> 01:08:30,791
[Sonny] Entering the routing number.

1614
01:08:30,875 --> 01:08:35,875
- That's right.
- Okay, so I'm done there, and bam.

1615
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:37,750
[computer beeps]

1616
01:08:38,833 --> 01:08:39,750
[phone chimes]

1617
01:08:39,833 --> 01:08:41,166
- It went through.
- Okay.

1618
01:08:41,833 --> 01:08:43,666
Sonny, you're a real mensch.

1619
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:45,916
And Huck, congratulations.
You're a free man.

1620
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,625
I have no words, Sonny, man. Thank you.

1621
01:08:47,708 --> 01:08:49,000
[Dorit] Is that Seal?

1622
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:51,708
I saw him play Tel Aviv in 2017.

1623
01:08:51,791 --> 01:08:54,041
Amazing show. I'm gonna ask for a selfie.

1624
01:08:54,583 --> 01:08:57,541
Seal! Seal! [speaking Hebrew]

1625
01:08:57,625 --> 01:08:59,166
Wow, Seal?

1626
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:01,541
He did me a favor. He's a sweetheart.

1627
01:09:01,625 --> 01:09:03,250
- Excuse me, Big Dog?
- Yeah?

1628
01:09:03,333 --> 01:09:04,541
I feel you'd wanna know

1629
01:09:04,625 --> 01:09:07,541
there's a bunch
of naked middle-aged people

1630
01:09:07,625 --> 01:09:08,625
in the Jacuzzi.

1631
01:09:08,666 --> 01:09:10,458
Thank you for the heads-up. Damn it.

1632
01:09:10,541 --> 01:09:12,750
- I don't want to body-shame but...
- Hey!

1633
01:09:12,833 --> 01:09:15,250
- [screaming]
- [laughing hysterically]

1634
01:09:15,333 --> 01:09:19,041
Jill! Combover Stew! No! Stop it. Stop!

1635
01:09:19,125 --> 01:09:20,458
Hey, Sonny, get wet.

1636
01:09:20,541 --> 01:09:21,375
- What?
- Yeah.

1637
01:09:21,458 --> 01:09:22,333
Come on, boo.

1638
01:09:22,416 --> 01:09:24,916
No, and that's enough. Okay?

1639
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
- Daddy!
- Yeah?

1640
01:09:26,041 --> 01:09:28,458
- Mom, Dad's out back.
- Oh my God. Hey!

1641
01:09:28,541 --> 01:09:31,791
Oh, my goodness, look at you.
What are you doing here?

1642
01:09:31,875 --> 01:09:33,291
I just talked to you in San Juan.

1643
01:09:33,375 --> 01:09:36,750
Armando gave us a lift
on his G5. It was sick.

1644
01:09:36,833 --> 01:09:38,958
Daddy, why did you kill Ole Snappy?

1645
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:42,083
Wh… what? Who… who's… who's that?
What are you talking about?

1646
01:09:42,166 --> 01:09:43,375
Armando's tortoise.

1647
01:09:43,458 --> 01:09:46,791
He sent a video to Mommy
of you and Uncle Huck running it over.

1648
01:09:46,875 --> 01:09:49,833
- It was unmistakably you.
- Okay, Snappy? Snappy, he's alive.

1649
01:09:49,916 --> 01:09:51,500
- Really?
- Yeah, he… he's fine.

1650
01:09:51,583 --> 01:09:54,416
So it's a misunderstanding. I just gotta...
I'm gonna talk to your mom.

1651
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:57,291
I'm gonna explain it... Wow.
There she is. Uh-oh. Oh, my.

1652
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:58,708
- [Bethany] Cannonball!
- Okay.

1653
01:09:59,916 --> 01:10:01,375
- Bethany, no!
- [partyers exclaim]

1654
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:02,458
Oh my God.

1655
01:10:03,041 --> 01:10:04,458
Oh, no.

1656
01:10:05,333 --> 01:10:07,708
Oh, that was such a small target.

1657
01:10:07,791 --> 01:10:10,708
But… I'm okay!

1658
01:10:10,791 --> 01:10:14,458
[partyers cheering]

1659
01:10:14,541 --> 01:10:15,458
Please go upstairs.

1660
01:10:15,541 --> 01:10:16,708
Okay, upstairs, every...

1661
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:18,958
What is going on?
I've been trying to reach you.

1662
01:10:19,041 --> 01:10:21,333
And what the hell were you doing
at Armando's house?

1663
01:10:21,416 --> 01:10:24,500
You can't ask me all the questions
because I can ask you questions too.

1664
01:10:24,583 --> 01:10:25,983
What was Armando doing in San Juan?

1665
01:10:26,041 --> 01:10:28,809
- We talked. I told you on the phone.
- We did not talk. We did not talk!

1666
01:10:28,833 --> 01:10:29,916
We did not talk!

1667
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,250
- We talked!
- I told you.

1668
01:10:31,333 --> 01:10:33,958
I said that me and Armando
are in a chess match.

1669
01:10:34,041 --> 01:10:37,708
So you're telling me that you let a rabbit
shit in his bed because it's part...

1670
01:10:37,791 --> 01:10:39,833
Let me stop you right there.
That wasn't a rabbit.

1671
01:10:39,916 --> 01:10:42,476
That was my shit. That was me
playing chess at the highest level.

1672
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:44,291
- You shit in the bed?
- [grunts]

1673
01:10:44,375 --> 01:10:45,416
And you're proud of that?

1674
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:48,250
- The fact that I did it on command.
- Hey, what's up, girl?

1675
01:10:48,333 --> 01:10:50,958
- Oh, Huck.
- Oh my God. I haven't seen you forever.

1676
01:10:51,041 --> 01:10:53,517
I love that sweater.
You know, I could not pull off that color.

1677
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:55,461
Thank you, Huck.
Can you just give us one minute?

1678
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,416
Oh, absolutely. Real quick, Maya?

1679
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:59,940
Can I just say, you are married
to one of the all-time greats.

1680
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,541
I don't know what I did
to deserve a friend like him,

1681
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:05,833
but he came to my rescue
in a way that I will never forget.

1682
01:11:05,916 --> 01:11:07,583
Exactly how did he do that?

1683
01:11:07,666 --> 01:11:09,809
- I can tell you later. Fill you in later.
- No, please.

1684
01:11:09,833 --> 01:11:12,291
- Huck, will you fill me in?
- I'll give her the Cliff Notes.

1685
01:11:12,375 --> 01:11:14,791
Look, I owed this loan shark
a huge amount of money.

1686
01:11:14,875 --> 01:11:16,250
It was looking dark.

1687
01:11:16,333 --> 01:11:19,500
Sonny stepped up and saved the day.
My brother. Thank you.

1688
01:11:19,583 --> 01:11:21,000
- [Maya] Thank you.
- No, thank you.

1689
01:11:21,083 --> 01:11:23,041
I'll let you two catch up. Give me a kiss.

1690
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:25,416
Thank you.
It's so good to see you as always.

1691
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:26,541
My guy.

1692
01:11:26,625 --> 01:11:27,458
You're a hero.

1693
01:11:27,541 --> 01:11:29,833
No. Nobody can read the room
like you, Huck.

1694
01:11:30,416 --> 01:11:31,833
- Um…
- Before you say anything,

1695
01:11:31,916 --> 01:11:33,083
let me say something to you.

1696
01:11:33,166 --> 01:11:34,166
Okay.

1697
01:11:34,208 --> 01:11:37,875
You need to understand the trouble
Huck was in. Huck was about to flee.

1698
01:11:37,958 --> 01:11:40,416
Sonny, how much money
did you pay the loan shark?

1699
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:43,125
You want a number? I don't have
a problem giving you a number.

1700
01:11:43,208 --> 01:11:44,517
- Okay, give it to me.
- All right.

1701
01:11:44,541 --> 01:11:46,750
- How much?
- All right. I think it was like 47?

1702
01:11:48,458 --> 01:11:52,083
Really, Sonny? You gave him $4,700?
Why did you do that?

1703
01:11:52,166 --> 01:11:53,708
It wasn't 4,700.

1704
01:11:53,791 --> 01:11:56,208
- Forty-seven… forty-seven…
- Forty-seven… [mumbles]

1705
01:11:56,291 --> 01:11:57,125
Forty-seven what?

1706
01:11:57,208 --> 01:11:58,958
Forty-seven thousand dollars.

1707
01:11:59,750 --> 01:12:01,125
Did you say $47,000?

1708
01:12:02,416 --> 01:12:04,336
Yeah, that's what I said.
That's what I gave him.

1709
01:12:04,416 --> 01:12:06,208
[Dash screaming]

1710
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,583
Oh my God. Hold on. Hold on.

1711
01:12:08,666 --> 01:12:10,291
- [Dash] Dad!
- Dash! Wait!

1712
01:12:11,083 --> 01:12:13,333
- [Dash screams] My Death Star!
- Dash! You okay, buddy?

1713
01:12:13,416 --> 01:12:14,416
[Dash] It's ruined!

1714
01:12:14,875 --> 01:12:17,000
Four months of painstaking Lego work,

1715
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,333
gone!

1716
01:12:18,416 --> 01:12:21,833
Dash, baby, go get your sister.
Okay? 'Cause we're leaving.

1717
01:12:21,916 --> 01:12:25,250
Yeah, just leave it… leave it there.
I'll snap it back. Watch out, buddy.

1718
01:12:25,333 --> 01:12:27,351
Listen, I'm looking at the pieces
that are broken...

1719
01:12:27,375 --> 01:12:29,333
All right, go ahead. Okay.

1720
01:12:30,041 --> 01:12:33,083
What? Maya. Maya, where you going?

1721
01:12:33,166 --> 01:12:35,291
Hey, come on, Maya. Maya...

1722
01:12:35,375 --> 01:12:36,975
- Hey, Dash, listen to me.
- [Dash] What?

1723
01:12:37,041 --> 01:12:38,961
I'm gonna build that Death Star
better than ever.

1724
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,583
You better not break
Hokey Pokey's shell too. You better not!

1725
01:12:42,666 --> 01:12:44,708
It was an accident.
I didn't do it on purpose.

1726
01:12:44,791 --> 01:12:45,791
Wh... Maya!

1727
01:12:46,166 --> 01:12:47,583
Maya, come on!

1728
01:12:48,125 --> 01:12:49,208
Okay, Maya!

1729
01:12:54,458 --> 01:12:56,000
They didn't wanna hang around?

1730
01:12:58,041 --> 01:13:00,458
I feel sick, man.
I need some water or something.

1731
01:13:00,541 --> 01:13:03,208
Whoa, hang with me for a beat.
You just need some fresh air.

1732
01:13:03,875 --> 01:13:05,791
Wait a minute. What is this?

1733
01:13:06,458 --> 01:13:10,458
Hey! Hey, slow down!
There's kids that live in this area!

1734
01:13:10,541 --> 01:13:11,541
Hey!

1735
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:13,833
Oh my God!

1736
01:13:13,916 --> 01:13:15,583
[tires squealing]

1737
01:13:15,666 --> 01:13:18,250
Whoa! Hey! Hey!

1738
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:20,250
Hey!

1739
01:13:20,291 --> 01:13:22,708
Oh God! What?

1740
01:13:24,083 --> 01:13:25,708
Hey, you son of a bitch!

1741
01:13:25,791 --> 01:13:27,708
Hey, man! Stop!

1742
01:13:27,791 --> 01:13:28,791
Stop!

1743
01:13:29,333 --> 01:13:31,250
What did I do to you? Hey!

1744
01:13:32,166 --> 01:13:33,166
God!

1745
01:13:33,625 --> 01:13:35,458
Why'd he do that to the Golden Chariot?

1746
01:13:35,541 --> 01:13:38,083
I ain't never did nothing to nobody.
Huck, did you see that?

1747
01:13:38,875 --> 01:13:42,708
Sonny, baby, looks like it's time
for that 2022 Honda Odyssey.

1748
01:13:42,791 --> 01:13:43,708
What?

1749
01:13:43,791 --> 01:13:44,791
Hit-and-run, baby.

1750
01:13:45,333 --> 01:13:47,250
Your insurance will cover a replacement.

1751
01:13:47,333 --> 01:13:49,916
That's my boy, Wade.
He's big into monster trucks.

1752
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:50,916
He did me a solid.

1753
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,500
You, my friend, you're gonna be driving
that sweet new ride by week's end.

1754
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:57,625
Let me… let me just…
let me sit with it for a second.

1755
01:13:57,708 --> 01:13:59,250
You gotta have that Odyssey, baby.

1756
01:13:59,333 --> 01:14:01,916
I know what I... Let me process it, Huck.

1757
01:14:02,541 --> 01:14:04,791
Just let me… let me process everything.

1758
01:14:04,875 --> 01:14:06,958
Let me just… let me just stay with it.

1759
01:14:07,041 --> 01:14:09,481
I know you're upset about Maya,
but when she sees the Odyssey,

1760
01:14:09,541 --> 01:14:10,741
she's gonna fall back in love.

1761
01:14:10,791 --> 01:14:11,991
Just give me a second, please.

1762
01:14:12,041 --> 01:14:14,458
- All right, but I just wanna...
- That was a blast, boys.

1763
01:14:14,541 --> 01:14:15,916
Sonny, Huck gave me your album.

1764
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,833
If I can find a CD player,
I'll give it a spin.

1765
01:14:18,916 --> 01:14:21,875
- Wow. Uh, thank you so much, man.
- You're welcome.

1766
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:24,791
Anyway, my Lyft's about two minutes away,
so if we can settle up?

1767
01:14:24,875 --> 01:14:26,500
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1768
01:14:26,583 --> 01:14:27,416
Absolutely.

1769
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,166
Hey, great set, bud.

1770
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:31,416
You're welcome. Okay. <i>Adios</i>.

1771
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:32,541
All right. <i>Adios,</i> Seal.

1772
01:14:32,625 --> 01:14:34,500
Will you pass that on to the label, huh?

1773
01:14:34,583 --> 01:14:36,333
Sorry about your little pinky.

1774
01:14:36,416 --> 01:14:38,875
Okay. You don't have to talk
so close to my face.

1775
01:14:39,375 --> 01:14:42,208
Seal. He's taking a Lyft.
I love that. He's so humble.

1776
01:14:42,291 --> 01:14:44,208
Why did you just give him a check, Huck?

1777
01:14:44,291 --> 01:14:46,708
- Huh?
- What "huh"? You said he did you a favor.

1778
01:14:46,791 --> 01:14:50,625
- Well, he did. He did us a favor.
- Then why'd you give him a check?

1779
01:14:50,708 --> 01:14:54,500
Dude, the guy usually gets a hundred grand
to do 20 minutes at a corporate event.

1780
01:14:54,583 --> 01:14:56,833
I got him to do
his whole set for twelve-five.

1781
01:14:56,916 --> 01:15:00,208
- It's half the money I paid for my effigy.
- It's not a favor, Huck.

1782
01:15:00,291 --> 01:15:01,833
God, man.

1783
01:15:01,916 --> 01:15:02,916
You never change.

1784
01:15:02,958 --> 01:15:03,875
You're a mess.

1785
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:05,458
- Wow.
- Yes.

1786
01:15:05,541 --> 01:15:07,833
- Tell me how you really feel.
- That's how I feel, Huck.

1787
01:15:07,916 --> 01:15:10,833
I'm not gonna lose a friend over money.
I'll pay Stan Berman back myself.

1788
01:15:11,416 --> 01:15:12,416
I'm done with you, man.

1789
01:15:12,458 --> 01:15:14,098
Why... We're just getting started, Sonny.

1790
01:15:14,166 --> 01:15:16,333
Everything's going so well.
What's the problem?

1791
01:15:16,416 --> 01:15:19,125
Here's another thing, Huck.
You're no George Clooney.

1792
01:15:19,208 --> 01:15:21,875
You're not even close to George Clooney.

1793
01:15:21,958 --> 01:15:23,838
That man built
a billion-dollar tequila business

1794
01:15:23,875 --> 01:15:24,750
as a side hustle.

1795
01:15:24,833 --> 01:15:27,833
You know what you're doing?
You're ordering tracksuits off Etsy.

1796
01:15:27,916 --> 01:15:29,708
Yeah, people love my tracksuits.

1797
01:15:30,458 --> 01:15:31,541
You're sad, man.

1798
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:35,916
And I'll tell you...
Are you kidding me, Seal? Put it...

1799
01:15:38,083 --> 01:15:41,333
Everybody?
May I have your attention, please?

1800
01:15:41,416 --> 01:15:43,750
- [partyer] 'Sup, Big Dog?
- Time for everybody to get out.

1802
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:48,250
Get out!

1803
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:51,416
- I don't wanna go back to Legoland!
- You're gonna take that drive, now!

1804
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:52,375
Shit!

1805
01:15:52,458 --> 01:15:54,875
You guys in the pool, get out!

1806
01:15:54,958 --> 01:15:58,375
- Ten more minutes.
- No, get out! All of you.

1807
01:15:58,458 --> 01:15:59,750
Let's go. Now.

1808
01:16:00,291 --> 01:16:03,875
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm sorry. Please. Please.

1809
01:16:03,958 --> 01:16:04,833
Thank you.

1810
01:16:04,916 --> 01:16:08,291

1811
01:16:10,166 --> 01:16:13,000

1813
01:16:20,250 --> 01:16:22,875
- [continues farting]
- [grunts] Mm, mm.

1814
01:16:24,541 --> 01:16:25,708
Shit.

1815
01:16:25,791 --> 01:16:28,958
It was such a fun party.
Uh, it was so great to see you.

1816
01:16:29,041 --> 01:16:30,041
Don't come over here.

1817
01:16:30,541 --> 01:16:32,916
Mr... My Uber's… my Uber's here.

1818
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,267
- Sorry, I just have to...
- Okay, go ahead at your own risk.

1819
01:16:35,291 --> 01:16:37,458
Okay, have a good… have a good night.

[pensive music playing]

1821
01:16:51,458 --> 01:16:55,750
Maya, listen,
I will get the money back. I promise.

1822
01:16:55,833 --> 01:16:57,916
Sonny… [sighs] …it's the money,

1823
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,416
it's… it's breaking into Armando's house.

1824
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:03,458
I mean, I just…
I feel like I don't know you.

1825
01:17:03,541 --> 01:17:06,083
First of all, that's not even me.
You know that.

1826
01:17:06,166 --> 01:17:08,083
That's Huck and his influence.

1827
01:17:08,166 --> 01:17:11,541
<i>All right? He's got me doing a bunch
of stupid shit that I'm not doing anymore.</i>

1828
01:17:11,625 --> 01:17:14,708
I'm done with that.
I'm back to being the Sonny of old.

1829
01:17:14,791 --> 01:17:17,500
The… the… the Sonny that's a super dad.

1830
01:17:17,583 --> 01:17:19,333
But… but maybe that's not what you want.

1831
01:17:19,416 --> 01:17:21,726
[Sonny] <i>Why would you say that?</i>
<i>That's exactly what I want.</i>

1832
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:23,208
Maya, can you come home?

1833
01:17:23,708 --> 01:17:26,708
[Maya]<i> Sonny, I think</i>
<i>we need a little time.</i>

1834
01:17:27,208 --> 01:17:28,666
We're gonna come home.

1835
01:17:29,333 --> 01:17:31,458
You should find someplace else to stay.

1836
01:17:31,541 --> 01:17:32,833
[Alan] I have an idea.

1837
01:17:32,916 --> 01:17:33,791
[Sonny] What the…

1838
01:17:33,875 --> 01:17:35,166
You can stay with us.

1839
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:36,458
[Sonny] <i>Are you kidding me?</i>

1840
01:17:36,541 --> 01:17:38,291
Alan, did you sleep in my laundry room?

1841
01:17:38,375 --> 01:17:40,958
[chuckles] Yeah. On second thought,
Rita's gonna have my ass

1842
01:17:41,041 --> 01:17:43,375
if she wakes up
at Legoland and I'm not there.

1843
01:17:43,875 --> 01:17:45,541
She'll take away my PS5.

1844
01:17:46,083 --> 01:17:47,125
Get out of my house.

1845
01:17:47,208 --> 01:17:49,208
Okay. I love you, Son.

1846
01:17:58,458 --> 01:17:59,875
Hey, buddy.

1847
01:17:59,958 --> 01:18:02,375
I really appreciate you
letting me stay here, man.

1848
01:18:02,458 --> 01:18:05,041
You know, me and Maya, we talked, right?

1849
01:18:05,125 --> 01:18:10,708
And we just feel like a little space
is probably best for us right now.

1850
01:18:10,791 --> 01:18:12,791
You stay as long as you want, Big Dog.

1851
01:18:12,875 --> 01:18:15,333
- Appreciate you.
- I got you. My house is your house.

1852
01:18:15,416 --> 01:18:16,916
Come on. You like honey?

1853
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,750
- Uh, yeah.
- 'Cause I put that shit on everything.

1854
01:18:19,833 --> 01:18:21,000
You ever have fried honey?

1855
01:18:22,208 --> 01:18:25,458
[Sonny] We gotta focus, everybody.
We have to focus.

1856
01:18:25,541 --> 01:18:29,125
The talent show's next week.
We gotta show this school who we are.

1857
01:18:29,208 --> 01:18:32,000
Okay? All right, Linus,
I'm gonna count you in.

- Why?

Why is Maya's opinion so valuable to you?

1902
01:20:29,708 --> 01:20:32,291
Because she's one of the best architects
in the world, Sonny.

01:28:58,583 --> 01:28:59,833
Where you at, Huck?

2092
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:01,500
The marina?

2093
01:29:02,875 --> 01:29:05,375
Oh my God,
Stan's about to go butcher on his ass.

2094
01:29:05,875 --> 01:29:07,541
I'm coming, Huck. I'm coming.

2097
01:29:17,916 --> 01:29:19,833
Oh God, Huck's in trouble.

2098
01:29:19,916 --> 01:29:22,083
I needed backup.
I didn't know who else to call.

2099
01:29:22,708 --> 01:29:25,041
I got you, Big Dog.
Let's go whoop some ass.

2100
01:29:25,125 --> 01:29:28,083
- No, we're not whooping no ass. Come on!
- Then why did I bring this?

2101
01:29:28,166 --> 01:29:32,041
I got some… some nunchucks
and a taser and some pepper spray.

2102
01:29:32,125 --> 01:29:35,833
What are you doing?
No, we don't need that. What is that?

2103
01:29:35,916 --> 01:29:36,916
Throwing stars.

2104
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:39,708
- Just...
- Just give me two of them.

2105
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:42,958
Eddie, get the lobsters first
before you get the guns.

2106
01:29:43,041 --> 01:29:46,416
It's gonna melt. Come on, chop-chop.
We gotta go guys, all right?

- That's Dorito.
- That's the bitch?

2111
01:30:07,541 --> 01:30:09,021
- Yeah.
- Do you want me to fight her?

2112
01:30:09,083 --> 01:30:10,500
No, she got a flamethrower.

2113
01:30:10,583 --> 01:30:12,166
- Oh shit!
- Come on.

2114
01:30:12,250 --> 01:30:13,250
Duck down.

- [Thelma] Is that blood?

2116
01:30:16,458 --> 01:30:18,083
Oh my God, that sounds like a bone saw.

2117
01:30:18,166 --> 01:30:19,208
- Oh my God!
- Huck!

2118
01:30:19,291 --> 01:30:22,666
- I'm coming to save you, Huck!
- I got two throwing stars and Thelma!

2119
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:25,083
- [blender whirring]
- Oh, thank God.

2120
01:30:25,166 --> 01:30:26,541
What are you guys doing?

2121
01:30:26,625 --> 01:30:29,291
- What do you mean? Thelma, go stand guard.
- Okay.

2122
01:30:29,375 --> 01:30:31,291
- Hey, baby girl.
- I'm so glad you're alive.

2123
01:30:31,375 --> 01:30:33,476
- It's great to see you. What's going on?
- Oh, you too.

2124
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:35,791
Dude, I thought
you was getting murdered, man.

2125
01:30:35,875 --> 01:30:37,583
I just saw somebody covered in blood.

2126
01:30:37,666 --> 01:30:40,041
No, we had
a strawberry daiquiri incident, stupid.

2127
01:30:40,125 --> 01:30:41,625
Why are you making daiquiris, Huck?

2128
01:30:41,708 --> 01:30:44,000
'Cause, it's my job.
What do you think I'm doing?

2129
01:30:44,083 --> 01:30:47,625
You know, I made a deal with Stan Berman
to pay you your $47,000 back,

2130
01:30:47,708 --> 01:30:49,125
and now I'm working off my debt.

2131

His business is taking him to Yemen,
so that's where I'm gonna move.

2132
01:30:52,125 --> 01:30:53,166

2133
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:54,416
Yeah, Yemen.

2134
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:56,583
Huck, your life is here.

2135
01:30:56,666 --> 01:30:57,500
- Really?
- Yes.

2136
01:30:57,583 --> 01:30:59,833
Well, I have no career, no family,

2137
01:30:59,916 --> 01:31:03,291
and you were right, Sonny,
I'm no Clooney, and I'm okay with it.

2138
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:05,458
Stop comparing yourself to Clooney.

2139
01:31:05,541 --> 01:31:08,041
Wanna know what I learned today
at Dash's talent show?

2140
01:31:08,125 --> 01:31:11,625
I learned that I have to embrace myself
and the people I love for who they are.

2141
01:31:11,708 --> 01:31:14,333
Bringing people closer together,
Huck, that's your gift.

2142
01:31:14,416 --> 01:31:16,136
- That's what you do.
- Don't do this to me.

2143
01:31:16,166 --> 01:31:18,392
- I'm not doing...
- Don't do this to me right now, okay?

2144
01:31:18,416 --> 01:31:21,500
This is my way out.
I got us into this. I'm gonna get us out.

2145
01:31:21,583 --> 01:31:24,583
Okay? Get off the bow,
and let me go batten down the hatches

2146
01:31:24,666 --> 01:31:25,826
and all that other boat talk.

2147
01:31:25,875 --> 01:31:26,875
What?

2148
01:31:27,583 --> 01:31:29,166
Huck, can you hear me out, please?

2149
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:30,416
I'm busy.

2150
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:33,250
[Sonny] You're opening and closing
the door, not battening anything.

2151
01:31:33,333 --> 01:31:36,041
Huck, listen, there…
there's another way out.

2152
01:31:36,125 --> 01:31:38,958
And you're great at throwing parties.
That's what you do well.

2153
01:31:39,041 --> 01:31:41,583
And you know what I'm great at?
Entertaining kids.

2154
01:31:41,666 --> 01:31:45,125
So here's my plan.
I go, I give Stan back the money.

2155
01:31:45,208 --> 01:31:49,083
Right? And you and I, we start a business
where we throw kids' parties.

2156
01:31:49,166 --> 01:31:53,000
We'll make the money back in no time.
I'll get you off the goddamn boat.

2157
01:31:53,083 --> 01:31:55,123
We'll put that stuff behind us.
How does that sound?

2158
01:31:57,375 --> 01:32:00,291
[laughing] I love you, buddy.
I don't want to go to Yemen.

2159
01:32:00,375 --> 01:32:02,095
- I know you...
- [Thelma] Let's go, idiots!

2160
01:32:02,125 --> 01:32:07,166
Yo, I just took the biggest shit
in the loan shark's bed.

2161
01:32:07,250 --> 01:32:08,375
Why would you do that?

2162
01:32:08,458 --> 01:32:11,083
I thought we were doing
the little annoying things like before,

2163
01:32:11,166 --> 01:32:12,708

You know how long it took me
to set this table?

2166
01:32:19,625 --> 01:32:21,416
How long's it gonna take to mess it up?

2167
01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:22,500
Huh?

2168

Let the claw get in my ass
so he can eat some claw ass.

when you got a little dick pepper.

- No, what are you doing? Stop. No.
- I'm grinding pepper on your dick.

2179
01:32:45,125 --> 01:32:47,351
- Why would you do that?
- You said you wanted dick pepper.

2180
01:32:47,375 --> 01:32:49,041
Then you gave me the prank, stupid.

2181
01:32:49,125 --> 01:32:51,166
I'm starting to itch bad.
This stuff is hot.
