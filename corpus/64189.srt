[Speaking French]

646
00:46:56,977 --> 00:46:58,968
I'll do better.

647
00:47:04,084 --> 00:47:09,249
Suppose I told you I was going
to rob the Casino Riviera on
the night before the Grand Prix?

648
00:47:10,991 --> 00:47:12,925
And all for you.

649
00:47:12,993 --> 00:47:16,485
- How much in the safe?
- Is that all you can say?

650
00:47:16,563 --> 00:47:18,963
That's all.

651
00:47:20,734 --> 00:47:23,294
Eighty million francs.

652
00:47:25,805 --> 00:47:27,796
So say it.

653
00:47:29,709 --> 00:47:32,234
Eighty million francs.

654

[Buzzing]

655
00:48:01,674 --> 00:48:03,608
- It's Roger.
- Are you sure?

656
00:48:03,676 --> 00:48:05,735
- Certain.
- Aw, shit!

657
00:48:05,812 --> 00:48:08,838
- Change of plan?
- Yeah. You gotta take the train.

658
00:48:08,915 --> 00:48:12,510
- And you take the camera.
- You mean this lighter is a camera?

659
00:48:12,585 --> 00:48:16,146
It's a Minox. Do you think
I was gonna go up there with a Nikon?

660
00:48:16,222 --> 00:48:20,056
Take pictures of paintings.
Then play slot machines till I get there.

661
00:48:20,126 --> 00:48:22,253
- How does it work?
- Open it up...

662
00:48:22,328 --> 00:48:25,092
Iook through the viewfinder,
give yourself a light.

663
00:48:25,165 --> 00:48:27,099
- You like smoking?
- Not that much.

664
00:48:27,167 --> 00:48:31,297
There's 24 paintings.
That's 24 Marlboro Lights, I hope.

665
00:48:31,371 --> 00:48:33,430
I was trying
to give it up.

666
00:49:45,944 --> 00:49:49,903
Roger, I've given up my studies
on the probability theory.

667
00:49:49,981 --> 00:49:54,042
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, all that computation addles the brain.

668
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:56,485
All I can say now is,
"What a coincidence!"

669
00:49:56,554 --> 00:49:59,284
- No. No coincidence. I was following you.
- [Scoffs]

670
00:49:59,357 --> 00:50:02,019
- Hot damn, wrong again.
- You found religion?

671
00:50:02,093 --> 00:50:05,358
I'm paying my respects...
to my mother.

672
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:08,399
- Do you remember that village
where she was born?
- Yeah. Bas-sur-I'Eau.

673
00:50:08,466 --> 00:50:11,924
- Yeah. That G.I. That came out of the sky?
- What is your father?

674
00:50:12,003 --> 00:50:14,870
Yeah. Well, they moved here,
to the old town.

675
00:50:14,939 --> 00:50:17,533
He became a junkie.
And when he up and left...

676
00:50:17,609 --> 00:50:21,943
she became one of those ladies in black you see
over there lighting candles.

677
00:50:22,013 --> 00:50:24,345
Praying for
her husband's return.

678
00:50:24,416 --> 00:50:27,544
- Were her prayers answered?
- Well, the way all prayers are answered.

679
00:50:27,619 --> 00:50:29,553
Not in the way
she wanted.

680
00:50:29,621 --> 00:50:31,851
He turned up again when I was seven,
clean as a whistle...

681
00:50:31,923 --> 00:50:35,916
with a new wife named Dora...
took me to a new life in America.

682
00:50:35,994 --> 00:50:39,361
And, by the time
I made it back here, well...

683
00:50:39,431 --> 00:50:41,490
- She wasn't lighting candles anymore.
- Yeah.

684
00:50:41,566 --> 00:50:43,966
You know, that's the third
version you've told me.

685
00:50:44,035 --> 00:50:48,233
Well, that's the truth.

686
00:50:48,306 --> 00:50:51,173
- So is it true what they're saying?
- What are they saying?

687
00:50:51,242 --> 00:50:54,234
Well, they say
you're back in business.

688
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,713
- No?
- The only business I'm in, Roger...

689
00:50:58,783 --> 00:51:01,581
is the business
of recovery.

690
00:51:01,653 --> 00:51:04,144
Three weeks. I'm clean.

Our daily bread,
forgive us our trespasses...

693
00:51:32,984 --> 00:51:35,418
Have you heard the story
of the Good Thief, Roger?

694
00:51:35,487 --> 00:51:37,751
- No. I'm not religious.
- No. Neither am I.

695
00:51:37,822 --> 00:51:40,655
But when my mother told it,
I guess it stuck.

696
00:51:40,725 --> 00:51:44,217
The Good Thief...
besideJesus on the cross...

697
00:51:44,295 --> 00:51:47,787
and Jesus said to him,
if I remember this right...

698
00:51:47,866 --> 00:51:50,926
"Tonight you will be
with me in paradise."

699
00:51:51,002 --> 00:51:54,494
And the thought that there was a place
in heaven for a thief always made me cry.

700
00:51:54,572 --> 00:51:56,506
[Chuckles]
You want to make me cry now?

701
00:51:56,574 --> 00:52:00,271
You gotta watch this cynicism, Roger.
It's too easy in that job of yours.

702
00:52:00,345 --> 00:52:04,543
- I'll work on my attitude.
- You should. You should.

but if you try something...

- Try what?
- Do I have to spell it out?
I'll put you down for life.

707
00:52:19,931 --> 00:52:22,297
- You're a cop. That's what you do.
- What are you?

708

I was good at thieving once, Roger,
and I may not be the Good Thief yet...

believe me, I am trying.
