00:11:52,624 --> 00:11:55,018
Take it easy.

183
00:12:23,394 --> 00:12:24,918
You got it?

184
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:27,747
The cure
is in the house.

185
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,791
Let's see.

186
00:12:28,835 --> 00:12:30,358
I could say
the same to you

187
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:31,881
unless you got
a stack of Benjamins

188
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:34,188
in your back pocket.

189
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:37,278
Sal, grab the briefcase.

190
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,594
Now show me my stuff.

191
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:05,436
You know, I usually
wouldn't meet anyone
like this.

192
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,568
Yeah?

193
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:08,396
Yeah.

194
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:11,703
Well, maybe you
shouldn't have.

195
00:13:11,747 --> 00:13:13,749
Draven: Hey, hey, what
the hell is going on?

196
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:14,663
I just
want to make sure

197
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:15,882
you don't have
some commie fuck

198
00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:17,057
out there
with a rifle.

199
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:17,884
Sal, grab the bag

200
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:19,059
and put it
in the car.

201
00:13:19,102 --> 00:13:21,496
Man, this is some bullshit.

202
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:23,628
Shut your mouth.

203
00:13:25,282 --> 00:13:26,849
When I find out
this shit's for real,

204
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:28,938
then you get your money.

205
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:43,474
Don't you
lose him, Sergei.

206
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,828
Fuckin' knew it.

207
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:02,276
Hey, where the fuck
you think you're going?

208
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:03,233
What the fuck
do you mean?

209
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:04,452
We're in this
together, Jimmy.

210
00:14:04,495 --> 00:14:05,801
No, no, no, no, no.

211
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,150
I ain't with nobody

212
00:14:07,194 --> 00:14:08,586
till I find out
this medicine's
the real thing.

213
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,587
And if it ain't, Sal,

214
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:12,634
or I find out
you set me up, hide.

215
00:14:12,677 --> 00:14:13,548
Now do me a favor.

216
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:16,551
Get the fuck
away from the car.

217
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,150
Assistant director:
All right. Quiet, please.

218
00:14:50,193 --> 00:14:53,022
Stand by for rehearsal.

219
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,766
This is 600 pounds.
Air ram is hot.

220
00:14:58,245 --> 00:15:02,684
1, 2, 3.

221
00:15:05,469 --> 00:15:07,602
That's the one.
On the money.

222
00:15:07,645 --> 00:15:08,690
Good, Len.

223
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:09,647
Lance, let me
talk to you one second.

224
00:15:09,691 --> 00:15:10,953
Lance: What?

225
00:15:10,997 --> 00:15:12,868
Listen, I can get
a lot more distance than that.

226
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,087
Why don't we increase
the pressure?
Whoa, whoa.

227
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,740
The gag is fine,
tough guy, all right?

228
00:15:15,784 --> 00:15:18,352
Don't change a thing
unless you want my job.

229
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:19,266
Now just remember,

230
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:21,268
the explosives
and primer cord

231
00:15:21,311 --> 00:15:22,399
right, are wired
to the ram,

232
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:23,618
so the second
you step on it...

233
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:25,968
I know. Everything
explodes 2 seconds later.

234
00:15:26,012 --> 00:15:26,926
I got it handled.

235
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:28,710
Yeah. That's what
I'm afraid of.

236
00:15:28,753 --> 00:15:30,233
[Chuckles]

237
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:33,062
All right, well...
Look, seriously,

238
00:15:33,106 --> 00:15:35,021
just...just make it
to that window.

239
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:36,544
Make sure you make it
to that window

240
00:15:36,587 --> 00:15:38,198
if you got to run
and dive, all right?

241
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:39,895
I will.
You ok?

242
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,592
Yeah. Yeah.

243
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:43,594
Airborne.

244
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,772
Assistant director:
The next one is picture.

245
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:50,993
Assistant director:
This will be picture.

246
00:15:55,432 --> 00:15:58,827
All right. Air ram's set
just like before, ok?

247
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:01,569
Have a good one,
all right?

248
00:16:01,612 --> 00:16:03,092
All right.

249
00:16:09,098 --> 00:16:11,971
All right, Glen,
you go to the archway.

250
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,276
Artie, go to the window.

251
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,670
You go around
the front door, Billy.

252
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,076
We're ready,

253
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:31,947
and go hot.

254
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:39,520
Assistant director:
We are hot.

255
00:16:39,563 --> 00:16:42,958
And roll the cameras.

256
00:16:49,312 --> 00:16:51,967
Assistant director:
All cameras are rolling.

257
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,925
It's yours, Lance.

258
00:16:54,752 --> 00:16:57,668
Action, Jimmy!

259
00:16:58,147 --> 00:17:00,454
Aah! Unh.

260
00:17:00,497 --> 00:17:03,544
Lance, I can't
move my fuckin' legs!

261
00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:05,285
Lance!

262
00:17:05,328 --> 00:17:07,200
Everyone in!

263
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:11,030
Assistant director:
Abort! Abort!

264
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,214
Aah!

265
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:32,051
Aah!

266
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,534
Get him out!
Come on!

267
00:17:41,886 --> 00:17:44,063
Get that kid out of there!

268
00:17:44,454 --> 00:17:47,501
Man: Get a paramedic in here!
Lance has been burned!

269
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:50,765
Assistant director:
Paramedics are on their way.

270
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:28,455
This man is the cause
of my nephew's death...

271
00:18:28,498 --> 00:18:30,065
My brother's only son.

272
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,022
That's no way

273
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:32,807
for someone
of my blood to die,

274
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,114
to be burned
like an animal.

275
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:37,116
And this man will die

276
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:37,986
and suffer,

277
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:40,554
suffer the way
Jimmy did.

278
00:19:03,229 --> 00:19:05,883
He doesn't look too good.

279
00:19:05,927 --> 00:19:08,190
He ain't.

280
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:10,192
Got this
triple-bypass surgery

281
00:19:10,236 --> 00:19:11,280
in a couple days.

282
00:19:11,324 --> 00:19:12,586
Jimmy dying
didn't help, either.

283
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:15,502
How long Jimmy
been doing movie stunts?

284
00:19:15,545 --> 00:19:16,851
Who knows?

285
00:19:16,894 --> 00:19:19,419
He kept it
to himself.

286
00:19:20,637 --> 00:19:22,726
All right, this is
how it's going down:

287
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,553
You go to Miami

288
00:19:23,597 --> 00:19:24,641
and you
find this guy,

289
00:19:24,685 --> 00:19:27,862
but you don't
whack him yet.

290
00:19:27,905 --> 00:19:29,080
Carlo's got it
in his head

291
00:19:29,124 --> 00:19:30,386
he wants
to be there.

292
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,431
Why?

293
00:19:31,474 --> 00:19:32,997
Feels he owes it
to his brother Joe,

294
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,085
Jimmy's father.

295
00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:35,957
How long before he can
get down there?

296
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,308
Long as it takes.

297
00:19:39,352 --> 00:19:41,658
Vito.

298
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:46,750
Eric, Sal Canzani.

299
00:19:46,794 --> 00:19:48,578
Nice to meet ya.

300
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:49,797
Pleasure.

301
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,711
Vito: Sal,
me and Eric are
in a thing here.

302
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:52,843
We'll talk later on,
all right?

303
00:19:54,497 --> 00:19:56,543
You got it, Vito.

304
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:04,812
All right, you just
Rose from the dead.

305
00:20:04,855 --> 00:20:05,682
You live in Philly.

306
00:20:05,726 --> 00:20:06,857
There's also
a contact number

307
00:20:06,901 --> 00:20:07,902
for any hardware
you need

308
00:20:07,945 --> 00:20:10,209
when you
get to Miami.

309
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:14,213
I'm glad
you're out, Eric.

310
00:20:17,346 --> 00:20:19,783
Just lose that
fatal flaw you got.

311
00:20:19,827 --> 00:20:22,003
What's that?

312
00:20:22,046 --> 00:20:23,222
Conscience.

313
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:26,050
The dead don't talk.
Remember that next time.

314
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:28,314
I will.

315
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:13,184
We'll have to talk
some other time, Sal.

316
00:21:13,228 --> 00:21:14,664
I took Carlo home
to get some rest.

317
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:18,842
Vito, I want to go back down
and find that money for him.

318
00:21:18,886 --> 00:21:20,496
I know I can.

319
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,150
Carlo ordered everyone
to stay out of Miami

320
00:21:22,193 --> 00:21:23,934
until he's ready
to go himself.

321
00:21:23,978 --> 00:21:25,762
Yeah, but I know
I could find it.

322
00:21:25,806 --> 00:21:26,720
Isn't that what he wants?

323
00:21:26,763 --> 00:21:28,461
Carlo doesn't
give a shit

324
00:21:28,504 --> 00:21:30,593
about the money
right now, Sal.

325
00:21:30,637 --> 00:21:31,725
His nephew
was just killed,

326
00:21:31,768 --> 00:21:32,726
and not for nothin',
you're lucky

327
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:33,944
he ain't holding you
responsible.

328
00:21:33,988 --> 00:21:36,295
It could be you
he wants torched.

329
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:38,166
I was out of line.

330
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:32,715
Unh.

331
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,936
Unh.

332
00:23:39,505 --> 00:23:40,941
No, no, no, no, no.
Hold. Cut.

333
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:42,725
That's a miss,
right?

334
00:23:44,074 --> 00:23:46,076
Um, first thing:
Up there,

335
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,208
when you
set him up there,

336
00:23:47,251 --> 00:23:48,209
he's coming
off the wall.

337
00:23:48,252 --> 00:23:49,210
You're throwing
a short punch.

338
00:23:49,253 --> 00:23:50,690
Actor: Ok.
So if he
comes on you,

339
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:51,560
set him up again,

340
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:52,692
and then
send it, ok?

341
00:23:52,735 --> 00:23:53,954
Second actor: Ok.

342
00:23:53,997 --> 00:23:55,172
And then over here,
there's a miss over here,

343
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:58,480
so, um, take him
off the rail.

344
00:23:58,524 --> 00:23:59,786
Bring him from here to here.

345
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:01,135
Am I clear here?

346
00:24:01,178 --> 00:24:02,876
All right, and then just
bring it to him straight.

347
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:04,878
Easy, easy.
Save it for the money.

348
00:24:04,921 --> 00:24:06,009
Let's go,

349
00:24:06,053 --> 00:24:07,750
ok?

350
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,670
Eric:
You all right?

351
00:24:57,713 --> 00:25:00,281
Yeah, yeah.

352
00:25:00,324 --> 00:25:01,238
It's my fault.

353
00:25:01,282 --> 00:25:02,283
I was looking
down at the radio,

354
00:25:02,326 --> 00:25:03,153
and I didn't see ya.

355
00:25:03,197 --> 00:25:04,938
At least it's not that bad.

356
00:25:04,981 --> 00:25:06,548
You do have insurance,
don't you?

357
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:10,030
Yes, but I'd like
to pay for this myself.

358
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:14,469
Fine with me.
My insurance is high enough.

359
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,818
Here, take
my driver's license,

360
00:25:15,862 --> 00:25:18,299
and we'll
exchange phone numbers.

361
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:30,093
I'm Eric.

362
00:25:30,137 --> 00:25:32,356
Clarissa.

363
00:25:33,357 --> 00:25:35,316
You're from
Philadelphia?

364
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:37,361
Yeah. I just moved here.

365
00:25:37,405 --> 00:25:40,408
Are you working
on that movie?

366
00:25:40,451 --> 00:25:42,192
No. No.

367
00:25:42,236 --> 00:25:45,065
My dad's
the stunt coordinator.

368
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:48,111
That's my number
at work.

369
00:25:48,155 --> 00:25:51,506
It's where I am
most of the time.

370
00:25:54,422 --> 00:25:56,511
You're
a nice guy, right?

371
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,732
I mean, you're not
gonna stiff me on this?

372
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:02,735
Here.

373
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:04,519
Call it a deposit.

374
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:09,002
No, that's ok. I just...
I have this bad habit

375
00:26:09,045 --> 00:26:11,004
of trusting people
too easily.

376
00:26:11,047 --> 00:26:12,658
That's why
I want you to keep it.

377
00:26:12,701 --> 00:26:13,876
Make people earn your trust.

378
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,270
That way,
you won't get taken.

379
00:26:19,055 --> 00:26:21,275
Thank you.

380
00:26:21,318 --> 00:26:24,060
I'll get an estimate
as soon as I can.

381
00:26:24,104 --> 00:26:27,020
There's no rush.
Take your time.

382
00:26:27,063 --> 00:26:28,499
Ok.

383
00:26:38,118 --> 00:26:40,163
You area nice guy.

384
00:26:40,207 --> 00:26:42,601
I try.

385
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,714
Assistant director:
Abort!

386
00:27:08,757 --> 00:27:11,673
Abort! Abort!

387
00:27:52,105 --> 00:27:55,325
Uh, say, could you spare me
some of that Cha...

388
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,467
So, how's it goin'
down there?

389
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,816
Look, I'm all set.

390
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,123
I found a good way
to stay close to him.

391
00:28:10,166 --> 00:28:11,733
Yeah? So, then
what's the problem?

392
00:28:11,777 --> 00:28:14,214
Let me do what I do best
and get it over with.

393
00:28:14,257 --> 00:28:15,302
No, no, no.

394
00:28:15,345 --> 00:28:16,477
You gotta do it his way.
You know that.

395
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,565
Besides, there's more
goin' on down there

396
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:19,306
than you know about.

397
00:28:19,828 --> 00:28:21,090
What's that?

398
00:28:21,134 --> 00:28:23,223
Well, let's say
some shit of ours
is missing.

399
00:28:23,266 --> 00:28:25,965
Listen, do yourself
a favor and relax.

400
00:28:26,008 --> 00:28:27,793
Go get laid
or something.

401
00:28:27,836 --> 00:28:29,229
The surgery went good,
but the old man

402
00:28:29,272 --> 00:28:31,579
is still recovering,
so you gotta sit tight.

403
00:28:31,622 --> 00:28:33,537
All right?

404
00:28:33,581 --> 00:28:35,539
Yeah.

405
00:28:53,296 --> 00:28:56,735
I'm gonna be with you
in just a second.

406
00:28:59,912 --> 00:29:01,391
Hello?

407
00:29:02,392 --> 00:29:03,785
Hi. It's Eric.

408
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:05,482
Hey, how are you?

409
00:29:05,526 --> 00:29:06,440
I'm doin' all right.

410
00:29:06,483 --> 00:29:08,398
How's that totaled car
of yours?

411
00:29:08,442 --> 00:29:10,183
Barely drivable.

412
00:29:10,226 --> 00:29:11,575
Listen, I haven't
had a chance

413
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:14,796
to get an estimate yet,
and I still have your money.

414
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,841
That's all right.

415
00:29:15,884 --> 00:29:16,972
Are you sure?

416
00:29:17,016 --> 00:29:18,147
Yeah.

417
00:29:18,191 --> 00:29:19,192
I was actually calling

418
00:29:19,235 --> 00:29:20,541
to see if you'd
have dinner with me.

419
00:29:20,584 --> 00:29:24,284
I haven't had
a decent meal
since I got to town,

420
00:29:24,327 --> 00:29:26,199
let alone
some good company.

421
00:29:26,242 --> 00:29:28,810
What do you say?

422
00:29:28,854 --> 00:29:30,594
Why not?

423
00:29:32,683 --> 00:29:34,729
How 'bout Friday night?

424
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,818
Ok.

425
00:29:36,862 --> 00:29:38,515
Where do I pick you up?

426
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,953
Can I wear my seat belt?

427
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,217
Very funny.

428
00:29:44,695 --> 00:29:47,960
Call me on Friday.
I'll give you directions.

429
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:50,745
I'll speak
to you then.

430
00:29:57,926 --> 00:30:00,015
[Girl coughing]

431
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:02,278
Oh, Mandy.

432
00:30:05,151 --> 00:30:07,849
I think the medicine
is making me sicker.

433
00:30:07,893 --> 00:30:09,895
It's not the medicine.

434
00:30:09,938 --> 00:30:11,635
You know I'd never
give you anything

435
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:12,854
that would hurt you.

436
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:14,508
I just don't want
to feel this way anymore.

437
00:30:14,551 --> 00:30:16,597
I know you don't, sweetie.

438
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,382
Believe me,
I'm trying everything I can

439
00:30:19,426 --> 00:30:21,167
to get you better.

440
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:25,127
We're gonna beat
this thing.

441
00:30:26,302 --> 00:30:27,608
You get some rest,
all right?

442
00:30:27,651 --> 00:30:30,219
I'll check back
in a little while.

443
00:30:30,263 --> 00:30:31,830
All right.

444
00:31:06,342 --> 00:31:09,171
Something wrong?

445
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,608
I'm sorry.

446
00:31:11,652 --> 00:31:12,871
I don't know.

447
00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:15,874
I'm doing my fellowship
in pediatric oncology

448
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:18,311
in a children's ward
at the hospital,

449
00:31:18,354 --> 00:31:20,791
and most
of the kids we treat

450
00:31:20,835 --> 00:31:23,011
have terminal cancer
and don't make it.

451
00:31:23,055 --> 00:31:27,233
They taught me not to get
emotionally attached

452
00:31:27,276 --> 00:31:29,452
or involved, but...

453
00:31:29,496 --> 00:31:32,194
Sometimes you just
can't help it.

454
00:31:32,238 --> 00:31:34,370
It gets to you.

455
00:31:34,414 --> 00:31:35,371
[Laughs]

456
00:31:35,415 --> 00:31:37,286
I'm sorry to start
the conversation

457
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,679
on such a downer.

458
00:31:38,722 --> 00:31:39,593
Don't be.

459
00:31:39,636 --> 00:31:41,116
I admire
what you do.

460
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,685
It's gotta be hard
to deal with that

461
00:31:44,728 --> 00:31:46,165
every day.

462
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:49,733
It reminds us how
lucky we all are...

463
00:31:50,256 --> 00:31:52,475
No matter what
situation we're in.

464
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:54,738
Yeah, it does.

465
00:31:58,394 --> 00:31:59,352
Hey, dad.

466
00:31:59,395 --> 00:32:00,657
Hi, kid.

467
00:32:00,701 --> 00:32:01,832
This is Eric.

468
00:32:01,876 --> 00:32:04,183
Hey. Don't call me dad
just yet.

469
00:32:04,226 --> 00:32:05,924
Uh, Lance'll do
for now.

470
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:07,142
Dad.

471
00:32:07,186 --> 00:32:09,188
It's nice
to meet you.

472
00:32:09,231 --> 00:32:10,189
Listen, I’m, uh,

473
00:32:10,232 --> 00:32:11,407
I'm sorry to interrupt
your dinner,

474
00:32:11,451 --> 00:32:14,367
but I got that message
about my prescription.

475
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,586
It's really good to have
a daughter for a doctor.

476
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:19,198
Or a doctor for a daughter,
whichever makes more sense.

477
00:32:19,241 --> 00:32:21,287
Anyway, look, I'll let
you two enjoy your night

478
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:22,853
without the old man
hanging over you.

479
00:32:22,897 --> 00:32:24,464
Why don't you stay
and have a drink?

480
00:32:24,507 --> 00:32:26,205
No, I'll just get
out of your way.

481
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:29,512
When have you ever
refused a drink?

482
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:33,560
Well, you got me there.
Well, ok, ok.

483
00:32:33,603 --> 00:32:34,517
Scotch and water.

484
00:32:34,561 --> 00:32:36,258
Scotch and water
sounds good.

485
00:32:36,302 --> 00:32:38,652
I'll have a Cabernet.

486
00:32:39,131 --> 00:32:40,219
So, what?

487
00:32:40,262 --> 00:32:42,003
Uh, where'd
you two meet?

488
00:32:42,047 --> 00:32:45,441
We ran into
each other downtown.

489
00:32:45,485 --> 00:32:47,791
I just moved here
from Philadelphia.

490
00:32:47,835 --> 00:32:49,054
You know, I did a...

491
00:32:49,097 --> 00:32:50,707
I did a couple
of pictures in Philly.

492
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:53,319
That's right. Clarissa
says you're a stunt man.

493
00:32:53,362 --> 00:32:54,320
Yeah.

494
00:32:54,363 --> 00:32:56,235
When are you doing
that pipe ramp?

495
00:32:56,278 --> 00:32:57,410
Um...

496
00:32:57,453 --> 00:32:58,411
That would be Monday.

497
00:32:58,454 --> 00:33:00,804
He's gonna crash
a car on purpose.

498
00:33:00,848 --> 00:33:01,849
I just want to, uh,

499
00:33:01,892 --> 00:33:03,459
show some
of those young punks

500
00:33:03,503 --> 00:33:06,201
that us old boys
can get it done. Cheers.

501
00:33:06,245 --> 00:33:08,073
Stop acting like
you're over the hill.

502
00:33:08,116 --> 00:33:10,249
I only do
because I am.

503
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:11,990
Hey, you ever been
on a set?

504
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:13,992
No.

505
00:33:15,341 --> 00:33:16,516
You have, um,
Clarissa bring you.

506
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,735
I'm sure you're gonna
get a kick out of it.

507
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:19,649
Dad.

508
00:33:19,693 --> 00:33:21,086
Why not?

509
00:33:21,129 --> 00:33:22,565
Yeah. Why not?

510
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:24,480
So, um, good.

511
00:33:24,524 --> 00:33:26,526
I'll see you then.

512
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:29,790
Ahh...

513
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:31,705
Well, thanks
for the dope, kid.

514
00:33:31,748 --> 00:33:32,706
I'll see you.

515
00:33:32,749 --> 00:33:34,316
See you, dad.

516
00:33:36,579 --> 00:33:38,799
I...I hope he didn't
put you on the spot.

517
00:33:38,842 --> 00:33:42,324
No, I’d...I'd like to see
how a film gets made.

518
00:33:42,368 --> 00:33:44,283
You don't mind, do you?

519
00:33:44,326 --> 00:33:47,851
No, no.
I think you'll like it.

520
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,784
He's gonna do what?

521
00:34:07,828 --> 00:34:09,003
[Laughs]

522
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,614
I see him do things
like this all the time.

523
00:34:11,658 --> 00:34:13,529
Kind of crazy,
isn't it?

524
00:34:13,573 --> 00:34:16,837
Just another day
at the office.

525
00:34:17,707 --> 00:34:20,797
Man: They're about ready
on camera, Lance.

526
00:34:21,233 --> 00:34:22,669
So, Sean will be
the first guy in,

527
00:34:22,712 --> 00:34:23,670
all right?

528
00:34:23,713 --> 00:34:25,498
All right.

529
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:27,065
Yeah...

530
00:34:27,717 --> 00:34:30,546
Well, strap
the old fart in.

531
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,332
Well, you've
always been my hero.

532
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:34,333
Blow me.

533
00:34:34,376 --> 00:34:36,248
[Laughs]

534
00:34:55,702 --> 00:34:57,704
All right.
Airborne, man.

535
00:34:57,747 --> 00:34:59,880
Time to fly
like an eagle.

536
00:34:59,923 --> 00:35:03,188
And land like
a sack of shit.

537
00:35:07,235 --> 00:35:08,628
All right. Lance is all set.

538
00:35:08,671 --> 00:35:09,933
Let's have effects go hot,

539
00:35:09,977 --> 00:35:11,587
and let us know
when cameras are rolling.

540
00:35:11,631 --> 00:35:14,416
Assistant director:
Stand by.

541
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,471
Assistant director:
We are hot.

542
00:35:25,514 --> 00:35:28,648
Let's roll all cameras.

543
00:35:29,475 --> 00:35:32,260
Action, Lance.

544
00:35:52,802 --> 00:35:56,980
[Breaths heavily]

545
00:36:11,908 --> 00:36:14,998
Assistant director:
That's a cut! Safety team in!

546
00:36:16,043 --> 00:36:18,001
Right there!
Right there!

547
00:36:21,744 --> 00:36:23,616
Assistant director:
We have no problems.

548
00:36:23,659 --> 00:36:26,140
Lance is good.
Copy that.

549
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,751
[All cheering]

550
00:36:31,058 --> 00:36:32,364
Whoo!

551
00:36:32,407 --> 00:36:33,756
Yeah! Yeah!

552
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,323
Yeah! Yeah!

553
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:36,759
Yeah! Yeah!

554
00:36:36,803 --> 00:36:37,630
Whoo!

555
00:36:37,673 --> 00:36:39,022
All right!
Unbelievable.

556
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:39,806
Whoo!

557
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:41,808
Check the car,
will you?

558
00:36:41,851 --> 00:36:44,289
I think I left
my ass in there.

559
00:36:44,332 --> 00:36:46,160
[All laughing]

560
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,422
Lance:
Not bad, was it?

561
00:36:47,466 --> 00:36:49,032
Not too shabby.

562
00:36:49,076 --> 00:36:50,599
Hey, Lance,
Lance, Lance.

563
00:36:50,643 --> 00:36:51,687
Yeah.

564
00:36:51,731 --> 00:36:53,863
It's 181 feet.
It's a new world record.

565
00:36:53,907 --> 00:36:54,995
[All cheering]

566
00:36:55,038 --> 00:36:57,606
Good one to quit on.
Good one to quit on.

567
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,608
Hey, you want to go
for a ride?

568
00:36:59,652 --> 00:37:01,306
I'll get it fixed up
in a minute.

569
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:02,655
No, thanks.

570
00:37:02,698 --> 00:37:03,873
Yeah, me, neither.

571
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:05,701
Hey, we're through
for the day.

572
00:37:05,745 --> 00:37:07,225
You guys come
to the beach with us.

573
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:10,663
Let's go.
It'll be fun.

574
00:37:10,706 --> 00:37:11,838
Sure. Why not?

575
00:37:11,881 --> 00:37:14,667
Fine? I gotta get
out of the monkey suit.

576
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:18,279
Do you mind
if I drop my car off?

577
00:37:18,323 --> 00:37:19,976
Not at all.

578
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,318
Looks like
a nice neighborhood.

579
00:37:57,362 --> 00:37:58,667
Yeah, it's pretty safe.

580
00:37:58,711 --> 00:38:00,843
There's this little old lady
who lives right there.

581
00:38:00,887 --> 00:38:05,413
She's a little obsessive
about watching my place.

582
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,678
What is it?

583
00:38:09,722 --> 00:38:13,073
You don't hear this
in my neighborhood.

584
00:38:13,116 --> 00:38:14,466
What's that?

585
00:38:14,509 --> 00:38:17,120
Silence.

586
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:52,721
Anything
for a thrill, huh?

587
00:38:52,765 --> 00:38:54,288
He says if he doesn't
scare himself

588
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,422
on a regular basis,
he'll shrivel up and die.

589
00:38:57,465 --> 00:38:58,684
Well, hanging
under a kite

590
00:38:58,727 --> 00:39:02,340
sure seems like
a good way to do it.

591
00:39:26,973 --> 00:39:29,671
[Indistinct chatter]

592
00:40:03,052 --> 00:40:05,446
You like flying,
do you?

593
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,753
Not enough
to try one of these.

594
00:40:07,796 --> 00:40:09,798
Yeah. They get
a little hairy.

595
00:40:09,842 --> 00:40:13,715
Just can't seem to
give it up, though.

596
00:40:19,504 --> 00:40:21,854
It's good
to have her home.

597
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:22,985
She was, um...

598
00:40:23,029 --> 00:40:25,335
She was out there
in L.A. visiting, uh,

599
00:40:25,379 --> 00:40:27,207
her mother, my ex.

600
00:40:27,947 --> 00:40:29,339
Great, great girl.

601
00:40:29,383 --> 00:40:30,471
Uh...

602
00:40:30,515 --> 00:40:31,994
I, uh, I made a big mess
out of that one,

603
00:40:32,038 --> 00:40:34,040
but that's what a lot of
booze will do for you.

604
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:36,172
Is that why
you moved here?

605
00:40:36,216 --> 00:40:39,219
Yeah, you know, to get
my head on straight.

606
00:40:39,262 --> 00:40:41,526
I mean, the truth
of the matter is, uh,

607
00:40:41,569 --> 00:40:43,005
a guy can live
almost anywhere nowadays

608
00:40:43,049 --> 00:40:44,833
and make a decent living
in this business.

609
00:40:44,877 --> 00:40:46,400
You must meet
a lot of guys

610
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,097
that say they'd like
to be stunt men.

611
00:40:48,141 --> 00:40:49,490
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we do.

612
00:40:49,534 --> 00:40:52,493
You got your, uh,
your dumb shits.

613
00:40:52,537 --> 00:40:54,539
You know, the idiots
that'll do anything

614
00:40:54,582 --> 00:40:56,018
except use their brains.

615
00:40:56,062 --> 00:40:57,063
Then you got
the vapor lockers...

616
00:40:57,106 --> 00:40:58,499
The would-be heroes
that, uh,

617
00:40:58,543 --> 00:40:59,979
you know, they get
right up to the get-go,

618
00:41:00,022 --> 00:41:01,328
and their heart
shrivels up

619
00:41:01,371 --> 00:41:03,112
to the size
of a mustard seed.

620
00:41:03,156 --> 00:41:05,550
And then every once
in a great while, uh,

621
00:41:05,593 --> 00:41:07,421
in a great while...

622
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,031
You get the guys
in between, you know,

623
00:41:09,075 --> 00:41:10,772
who use their brains
and their balls and...

624
00:41:10,816 --> 00:41:12,687
Well, obviously, they're
the ones we look for.

625
00:41:12,731 --> 00:41:16,299
What if I told I thought
I'd make a good stunt man?

626
00:41:16,343 --> 00:41:19,738
Oh, well, that would just
shock the hell out of me.

627
00:41:19,781 --> 00:41:22,697
I saw your eyes today
when I got out of that car.

628
00:41:22,741 --> 00:41:23,698
It looked like a...

629
00:41:23,742 --> 00:41:25,134
Like a kid's
on Christmas morning.

630
00:41:25,178 --> 00:41:27,789
Anyway, just, uh,
just forget about it.

631
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:30,575
It's a rough racket, and
you'll do a lot of starving.

632
00:41:30,618 --> 00:41:32,315
I got some money
saved up.

633
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:34,883
Money. Well,
it takes a...

634
00:41:34,927 --> 00:41:37,103
It takes a lot
of dedication

635
00:41:37,146 --> 00:41:38,060
and a lot of time.

636
00:41:38,104 --> 00:41:40,759
Something I've
got a lot of...

637
00:41:40,802 --> 00:41:41,760
Time.

638
00:41:41,803 --> 00:41:43,675
Hmm...

639
00:41:43,718 --> 00:41:44,980
Well...

640
00:41:45,024 --> 00:41:46,373
Well?

641
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:47,417
Well?

642
00:41:47,461 --> 00:41:49,724
Will you teach me
how to do stunts?

643
00:41:49,768 --> 00:41:51,378
Oh, see, I’m, uh...

644
00:41:51,421 --> 00:41:55,077
I'm just really sorry,
Eric. I just, uh...

645
00:41:55,121 --> 00:41:56,296
I just think
my teaching days

646
00:41:56,339 --> 00:41:57,558
are over, you know?

647
00:41:57,602 --> 00:42:01,344
Well, if that's the way
you feel about it.

648
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,912
[Laughs]

649
00:42:03,956 --> 00:42:05,958
All right, listen,
you pain in the ass.

650
00:42:06,001 --> 00:42:07,916
I'll tell you,
I'll, uh...

651
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,135
I'll give you
a little taste,

652
00:42:09,178 --> 00:42:11,790
and we'll see how
it goes, all right?

653
00:42:36,423 --> 00:42:40,645
So there I was, assigned
to tail Jimmy pierazzi

654
00:42:40,688 --> 00:42:43,604
for 2 long-ass years,

655
00:42:43,648 --> 00:42:47,652
and I can't even pin
a parking ticket on his ass.

656
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,655
But then,
my prayers are answered.

657
00:42:50,698 --> 00:42:55,224
Now, it's nothing sexy
like murder, extortion,

658
00:42:55,268 --> 00:42:57,270
racketeering.

659
00:42:57,313 --> 00:43:01,796
Hell, the motherfucker's
acting like a savior
for humanity.

660
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,581
But the shit
is still illegal

661
00:43:03,624 --> 00:43:05,670
and my ticket home
to my family,

662
00:43:05,713 --> 00:43:06,845
so I set it up.

663
00:43:06,888 --> 00:43:09,238
I go out on a limb,

664
00:43:09,282 --> 00:43:10,196
a big...

665
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:12,807
Fucking...

666
00:43:12,851 --> 00:43:14,679
Shaky-ass limb

667
00:43:14,722 --> 00:43:16,419
to set this shit up.

668
00:43:16,463 --> 00:43:20,641
Now it's about to snap
right under my ass, Sal.

669
00:43:20,685 --> 00:43:21,903
Hey, you gotta
give me a break.

670
00:43:21,947 --> 00:43:24,297
I checked on the girl
like you said,

671
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,038
and they already
have someone on her.

672
00:43:26,081 --> 00:43:27,387
This guy sees me,
I'm dead.

673
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:29,128
See, now,
that's ironic,

674
00:43:29,171 --> 00:43:31,347
because that's exactly
what time it is...

675
00:43:31,391 --> 00:43:32,218
Do or die.

676
00:43:32,261 --> 00:43:33,349
You can't squeeze me.

677
00:43:33,393 --> 00:43:34,568
Heh heh heh ho!

678
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,396
Yes, I can.

679
00:43:36,439 --> 00:43:38,833
I'm a U.S. federal
fucking agent

680
00:43:38,877 --> 00:43:41,401
who's way out of
his jurisdiction, Sal,

681
00:43:41,444 --> 00:43:43,229
and one who's
been ordered

682
00:43:43,272 --> 00:43:46,101
into an internal
investigation in 3 days.

683
00:43:46,145 --> 00:43:47,886
You see, they consider it
highly illegal

684
00:43:47,929 --> 00:43:51,454
to remove $2 million
of seized property

685
00:43:51,498 --> 00:43:52,412
from FBI vaults,

686
00:43:52,455 --> 00:43:54,066
and the shit's
still missing.

687
00:43:54,109 --> 00:43:56,764
Yeah, and so is
the family's money.

688
00:44:01,029 --> 00:44:03,249
Well, you see,
that's not my problem.

689
00:44:03,292 --> 00:44:06,731
You just keep tailing
the girl, partner.

690
00:44:06,774 --> 00:44:07,949
She's our only lead.

691
00:44:07,993 --> 00:44:09,124
I ain't
your fucking partner.

692
00:44:09,168 --> 00:44:12,954
You're the FBI.
You tail her.

693
00:44:14,956 --> 00:44:16,436
Tell you what, partner.

694
00:44:16,479 --> 00:44:19,439
Why don't I give
Carlo pierazzi a call

695
00:44:19,482 --> 00:44:20,658
and tell him you've
been an informant

696
00:44:20,701 --> 00:44:22,747
for the last 3 years.
We'll let him decide.

697
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:24,313
It's not
my fucking fault

698
00:44:24,357 --> 00:44:26,228
that Jimmy's dead!

699
00:44:26,272 --> 00:44:27,273
Lower your voice.

700
00:44:27,316 --> 00:44:29,318
Fuck you! And fuck
all these people!

701
00:44:29,362 --> 00:44:31,364
I am not taking
the fall for this!

702
00:44:31,407 --> 00:44:32,887
I'm not.

703
00:44:39,067 --> 00:44:42,505
Find my fucking
medicine, Sal.

704
00:44:53,778 --> 00:44:56,563
So, this is where we train
and keep the equipment

705
00:44:56,606 --> 00:44:59,087
Lance rents out
to productions.

706
00:44:59,131 --> 00:45:01,655
Hello, Eric.
You, uh,

707
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,048
you met Graham
here, uh,

708
00:45:03,091 --> 00:45:05,267
runs my equipment
rental business,

709
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:07,966
does my rigging,
just about everything else.

710
00:45:08,009 --> 00:45:10,142
Uh, ok.

711
00:45:10,185 --> 00:45:11,447
So, now it's...
It's time

712
00:45:11,491 --> 00:45:12,405
for the speech
that I give,

713
00:45:12,448 --> 00:45:15,669
and I'm only gonna
give it once.

714
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,279
All right, um,

715
00:45:17,323 --> 00:45:18,367
if you think

716
00:45:18,411 --> 00:45:21,806
that all this
is about, uh, daredevil,

717
00:45:21,849 --> 00:45:24,286
uh, Evel Knievel crap,
you got it all wrong.

718
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:26,854
This is about
professionals being serious.

719
00:45:26,898 --> 00:45:29,727
And the idea is not
to ever get hurt.

720
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:32,164
I mean,
not even a scratch, ok?

721
00:45:32,207 --> 00:45:33,513
So, that means
if I tell you

722
00:45:33,556 --> 00:45:35,863
to jump in the air,
shit your pants

723
00:45:35,907 --> 00:45:36,908
before your feet
hit the ground,

724
00:45:36,951 --> 00:45:39,693
you do exactly
what I say, 'cause...

725
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,521
That's what's
gonna save your ass.

726
00:45:41,564 --> 00:45:44,176
And, uh,
when I rig something,

727
00:45:44,219 --> 00:45:46,700
it stays rigged
the way I rig it.

728
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,397
You understand?

729
00:45:50,008 --> 00:45:51,139
You understand?

730
00:45:51,183 --> 00:45:51,966
Yeah.

731
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:54,186
Ok. Well,
let's get in on.

732
00:45:54,229 --> 00:45:55,753
All right.

733
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,584
No, hold it, hold it,
hold it, hold it. Hold it.

734
00:46:01,628 --> 00:46:03,369
You see,
if the camera's over here?

735
00:46:03,412 --> 00:46:04,631
Look, stand over there.

736
00:46:04,674 --> 00:46:08,853
You can't come short.
You gotta make contact.

737
00:46:12,421 --> 00:46:14,772
Lance: That's better.
Yeah.

738
00:46:18,645 --> 00:46:20,603
Bam! You see? Like...

739
00:46:20,647 --> 00:46:21,822
Bam! Yeah.

740
00:46:21,866 --> 00:46:23,432
Bam! There.

741
00:46:23,476 --> 00:46:24,259
Bam!

742
00:46:24,303 --> 00:46:26,392
[All laughing]

743
00:48:17,633 --> 00:48:18,678
We're hot.

744
00:48:18,721 --> 00:48:20,898
Let's go
for the ride.

745
00:48:31,517 --> 00:48:36,043
The reason your knee buckled
is you didn't commit.

746
00:48:36,739 --> 00:48:38,698
You gotta go for it.

747
00:48:38,741 --> 00:48:40,352
That thing ready
to go again?

748
00:48:40,395 --> 00:48:42,006
It could be.

749
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,230
We're hot.

750
00:48:54,496 --> 00:48:56,020
Graham: There you go.

751
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,717
Yeah.

752
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,892
That's the mind-set
you need.

753
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,763
Jump in the saddle
when you fall off.

754
00:49:00,807 --> 00:49:01,808
That's good.

755
00:49:01,851 --> 00:49:03,114
Oh. Easy.

756
00:49:03,157 --> 00:49:05,377
It was just a slap
on the shoulder.

757
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:06,552
Yeah.

758
00:49:06,595 --> 00:49:08,380
Come on. Let's go
in the house real quick.

759
00:49:08,423 --> 00:49:09,685
It's not often
I get a chance

760
00:49:09,729 --> 00:49:11,644
to have my daughter
come over and cook.

761
00:49:11,687 --> 00:49:13,515
I bet you probably had
something do with that,

762
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:15,691
but you know,
I'm just guessing.

763
00:49:15,735 --> 00:49:16,779
[Clarissa laughs]

764
00:49:16,823 --> 00:49:20,392
Get out. You were
captain courageous?

765
00:49:20,435 --> 00:49:23,003
That's right.
The one and the only.

766
00:49:23,047 --> 00:49:24,570
He climbed
the empire state building.

767
00:49:24,613 --> 00:49:27,355
And that is
also very true. Yes, indeed.

768
00:49:27,399 --> 00:49:28,574
How do you do that?

769
00:49:28,617 --> 00:49:30,054
Do what, climb
the empire state building?

770
00:49:30,097 --> 00:49:33,144
How would you do it?
With my hands and feet.

771
00:49:33,187 --> 00:49:35,233
What do you mean?

772
00:49:36,712 --> 00:49:39,237
We used a little cable.

773
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,281
Honey, would you, uh,

774
00:49:40,325 --> 00:49:41,413
would you pour
your daddy just about

775
00:49:41,456 --> 00:49:43,284
another 10 inches about?

776
00:49:43,328 --> 00:49:46,940
What's the closest call
you've ever had?

777
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,463
Definitely
the speedboat.

778
00:49:48,507 --> 00:49:50,770
Oh, yeah. The, uh...

779
00:49:50,813 --> 00:49:53,991
The dreaded speedboat.

780
00:49:54,034 --> 00:49:54,904
Over 900 stitches

781
00:49:54,948 --> 00:49:56,776
and a year
in the hospital.

782
00:49:56,819 --> 00:49:59,300
Why didn't you quit?

783
00:49:59,344 --> 00:50:01,737
The truth is, uh...

784
00:50:01,781 --> 00:50:03,043
You know,
everybody's brave

785
00:50:03,087 --> 00:50:06,177
till that first trip
to the hospital, and...

786
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,700
Well, unfortunately,

787
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:13,010
sometimes that's
the real test.

788
00:50:21,627 --> 00:50:23,150
Thank you.

789
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:30,027
Let me get this straight.
This guy's threatened

790
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:32,681
to tip off the feds that
we're dealing in this shit?

791
00:50:32,725 --> 00:50:34,335
He's got some balls,
I'll tell you that.

792
00:50:34,379 --> 00:50:37,121
He's obviously a wack-job,
or he's bluffing.

793
00:50:37,164 --> 00:50:38,383
Vito, enough.

794
00:50:38,426 --> 00:50:39,819
Jimmy said this Draven
has others on the take.

795
00:50:39,862 --> 00:50:43,562
Who's to say he doesn't
have the FBI also, huh?

796
00:50:43,605 --> 00:50:45,781
We have to be careful.

797
00:50:45,825 --> 00:50:47,087
I'm not sure, Carlo.

798
00:50:47,131 --> 00:50:48,001
And I am sorry
to bother you

799
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,742
at home while
you're resting.

800
00:50:49,785 --> 00:50:50,830
I just wanted you
to know.

801
00:50:50,873 --> 00:50:53,050
You did good,
Salvatore.

802
00:50:53,093 --> 00:50:54,834
You should tell
your family everything.

803
00:50:54,877 --> 00:50:57,010
That's the way
it should be.

804
00:50:58,577 --> 00:51:00,274
Vito.

805
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:03,408
This Draven must go.

806
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,950
There was this kid, uh...

807
00:51:25,256 --> 00:51:27,388
Jimmy Moore.

808
00:51:34,787 --> 00:51:37,572
You remind me of him.

809
00:51:38,921 --> 00:51:40,401
He, uh...

810
00:51:41,924 --> 00:51:43,491
He was a natural

811
00:51:43,535 --> 00:51:47,191
and had the heart
of a lion.

812
00:51:48,757 --> 00:51:50,890
Anyway, um...

813
00:51:50,933 --> 00:51:55,112
I lost him about
2 or 3 months ago.

814
00:51:55,155 --> 00:51:58,071
He was doing this, uh...

815
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:00,291
Air ram explosion
through a window.

816
00:52:00,334 --> 00:52:01,901
I don't know what
the hell happened,

817
00:52:01,944 --> 00:52:03,946
but, uh, he never
made it out the window

818
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:08,342
before the mortars
went off, and, uh...

819
00:52:08,386 --> 00:52:09,387
Well...

820
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:11,954
Is that how you burned
your leg?

821
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,614
Yeah, well...

822
00:52:21,877 --> 00:52:23,227
Losing Jimmy was about...

823
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:26,055
About the toughest thing
I ever had to go through.

824
00:52:26,099 --> 00:52:27,753
I mean, don't...

825
00:52:27,796 --> 00:52:29,885
Don't get me wrong.
I mean, I, uh,

826
00:52:29,929 --> 00:52:31,278
I wouldn't give up
what I do for...

827
00:52:31,322 --> 00:52:33,237
For all the tea
in China.

828
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,545
I mean, I had me
some great, great times...

829
00:52:38,111 --> 00:52:41,593
And I lost a couple friends
along the way.

830
00:52:41,636 --> 00:52:44,639
And one of 'em, um...

831
00:52:45,466 --> 00:52:46,772
He used to say,

832
00:52:46,815 --> 00:52:49,514
"we dance
in the shadows of death

833
00:52:49,557 --> 00:52:53,431
every time
we step onto the set."

834
00:52:54,649 --> 00:52:57,478
I guess he was right.

835
00:52:59,001 --> 00:53:01,830
What are you
trying to say?

836
00:53:03,789 --> 00:53:05,312
I'm saying, uh,

837
00:53:05,356 --> 00:53:08,881
it's no disgrace
to walk away.

838
00:53:11,666 --> 00:53:14,626
I understand the risks.

839
00:53:19,108 --> 00:53:20,632
Okey-doke.

840
00:53:53,665 --> 00:53:56,363
Lance:
Let's get that cable up.

841
00:54:02,064 --> 00:54:04,197
He knows what he's doing
with all this stuff, right?

842
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,329
You just do exactly
what he says to do.

843
00:54:05,372 --> 00:54:09,376
You'll be fine.
Lance is the best, man.

844
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:10,508
Double-checked
the carabiners,
right?

845
00:54:10,551 --> 00:54:13,554
Easy. Double-check
right over there.

846
00:54:13,598 --> 00:54:14,729
Yeah, Graham.

847
00:54:14,773 --> 00:54:15,687
Yeah.

848
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:17,254
Why don't you, uh,
run downstairs

849
00:54:17,297 --> 00:54:18,342
and double-check
everything's cleared

850
00:54:18,385 --> 00:54:19,952
under the jump
position, all right?

851
00:54:19,995 --> 00:54:22,302
Graham:
All right,
you got it.

852
00:54:22,346 --> 00:54:24,304
And...and...

853
00:54:24,348 --> 00:54:26,872
All right,
let's, uh,

854
00:54:26,915 --> 00:54:28,569
let's go over
what we both know.

855
00:54:28,613 --> 00:54:31,093
I know that the, uh,
the cable's measured

856
00:54:31,137 --> 00:54:32,530
to stop you 3 feet
from the ground,

857
00:54:32,573 --> 00:54:33,748
and all you
have to know...

858
00:54:33,792 --> 00:54:36,534
All you have to know
is headfirst.

859
00:54:36,577 --> 00:54:39,406
If you do,
piece of cake.

860
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:42,191
So, uh,
you all right?

861
00:54:42,235 --> 00:54:44,411
Yeah.

862
00:54:44,455 --> 00:54:48,546
Airborne, cowboy.
Break your cherry.

863
00:54:56,075 --> 00:54:59,121
Assistant director:
Stand by for picture.

864
00:55:07,129 --> 00:55:09,393
Decelerator's on, Eric.

865
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:15,964
Assistant director:
We are rolling.

866
00:55:17,966 --> 00:55:19,141
We're ready.

867
00:55:19,185 --> 00:55:22,884
Lance: All right!
3...

868
00:55:22,928 --> 00:55:23,972
2...

869
00:55:24,016 --> 00:55:24,886
1!

870
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:26,801
Action!

871
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,602
[Grunts]

872
00:55:44,645 --> 00:55:46,473
Assistant director:
That's a cut.

873
00:55:46,517 --> 00:55:48,823
Safety team in.

874
00:55:49,171 --> 00:55:50,608
All right, boys,
unhook him.

875
00:55:50,651 --> 00:55:53,175
I'll be right down.

876
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:56,440
All right,
lower him down.

877
00:55:56,483 --> 00:55:58,137
More.

878
00:55:58,746 --> 00:55:59,617
A little more.

879
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:03,272
Yeah, there you go.
[Chuckles]

880
00:56:03,316 --> 00:56:05,274
[Applause]

881
00:56:05,318 --> 00:56:07,712
So what do you
think, huh?

882
00:56:07,755 --> 00:56:09,322
Fucking amazing.

883
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:11,019
[Laughs]

884
00:56:11,063 --> 00:56:14,022
All right, Lance.
We got him.

885
00:56:16,677 --> 00:56:18,157
Wow, it's so different

886
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,246
when my dad's
the one doing it.

887
00:56:20,289 --> 00:56:21,813
Yeah? Why is that?

888
00:56:21,856 --> 00:56:24,337
I don't know.
I've just watched him
do stunts for so long,

889
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,339
he's become
invincible to me,

890
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:29,864
but with you, I was...

891
00:56:29,908 --> 00:56:32,214
I was really worried.

892
00:56:34,695 --> 00:56:36,436
Come here.

893
00:56:52,147 --> 00:56:54,585
Hey! Hey, hey!

894
00:56:55,977 --> 00:56:57,805
That's my daughter
you pawin'.

01:14:30,335 --> 01:14:32,468
to find
where Jimmy hid it.

1075
01:14:33,817 --> 01:14:35,775
They didn't tell you
shit, did they?

1076
01:14:35,819 --> 01:14:37,560
That fed
that you hit,

1077
01:14:37,603 --> 01:14:39,475
he was doin' a deal
with me and Jimmy,

1078
01:14:39,518 --> 01:14:41,085
but Jimmy
decided to fuck him,

1079
01:14:41,128 --> 01:14:43,522
and the asshole
left me holdin'
the bag.

1080
01:14:43,566 --> 01:14:45,698
I guess
I owe you one.

1081
01:14:46,743 --> 01:14:47,700
What do you want?

1082
01:14:47,744 --> 01:14:49,049
I want the money,

1083
01:14:49,093 --> 01:14:50,747
and you're gonna
help me find it.

1084
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:52,052
It'd be a shame
for Carlo to know

1085
01:14:52,096 --> 01:14:53,271
you were hangin'
around that jerk-off

1086
01:14:53,314 --> 01:14:54,402
who got
his nephew killed.

1087
01:14:54,446 --> 01:14:56,448
I don't think so.
If you want the money,

1088
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,668
the last thing you'll do
is tell Carlo anything.

1089
01:14:58,711 --> 01:15:01,453
That's why I'm gonna
split it with you 50-50

1090
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:02,802
if you can find it.

1091
01:15:02,846 --> 01:15:04,238
What makes
you think I can?

1092
01:15:04,282 --> 01:15:06,197
This is Jimmy's
backyard, brother.

1093
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:08,591
It'll be easy.

1094
01:15:10,201 --> 01:15:11,985
Come here.

1095
01:15:12,029 --> 01:15:13,030
[Groans]

1096
01:15:13,073 --> 01:15:15,380
She doesn't know
where the money is,

1097
01:15:15,423 --> 01:15:17,469
so you stay
away from her.

1098
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:19,123
The next fuck who comes
anywhere near her,

1099
01:15:19,166 --> 01:15:21,865
I'll gut you first.
You understand me?

1100
01:15:24,824 --> 01:15:27,044
50-50...

1101
01:15:27,087 --> 01:15:29,655
Is not a bad deal.

1102
01:15:41,362 --> 01:15:43,408
I thought I saw
a friend of mine.

1103
01:15:43,451 --> 01:15:45,802
Was it them?

1104
01:15:45,845 --> 01:15:47,891
No.

1105
01:15:56,856 --> 01:15:57,770
[TV playing]

1106
01:15:57,814 --> 01:16:00,381
You watch much
football, cowboy?

1107
01:16:04,429 --> 01:16:06,866
I didn't think so.

1108
01:16:08,215 --> 01:16:10,522
You ever think about
how you're gonna die?

1109
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:11,958
How what?

1110
01:16:12,002 --> 01:16:15,571
I said, "you ever
think about how
you're gonna die?"

1111
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:18,965
I, uh...As you get older,

1112
01:16:19,009 --> 01:16:21,533
you think about how
you don’t wanna die.

1113
01:16:21,577 --> 01:16:22,752
What do you mean?

1114
01:16:22,795 --> 01:16:24,797
You know, bedridden
in some hospital,

1115
01:16:24,841 --> 01:16:26,407
wastin' away.

1116
01:16:26,451 --> 01:16:27,278
I'll tell you
what I do know.

1117
01:16:27,321 --> 01:16:28,801
I ain't gonna
fizzle out.

1118
01:16:28,845 --> 01:16:30,673
I'm gonna
crash and burn.

1119
01:16:30,716 --> 01:16:32,631
I guess my thing is
I just don't wanna go out

1120
01:16:32,675 --> 01:16:35,591
without having
a family first.

1121
01:16:36,635 --> 01:16:38,158
Tired of bein' on my own.

1122
01:16:38,202 --> 01:16:41,466
Ah, you ain't
on your own, pal.

1123
01:16:42,728 --> 01:16:43,947
Thanks.

1124
01:16:43,990 --> 01:16:45,949
Hey, you're not goin'
suicidal on me, are ya?

1125
01:16:45,992 --> 01:16:47,428
No.

1126
01:16:50,257 --> 01:16:52,346
You got any work
for me this week?

1127
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:53,260
Nah, not really.

1128
01:16:53,304 --> 01:16:55,741
Got a really big
air ram gag...

1129
01:16:55,785 --> 01:16:56,742
Kind of
like Jimmy's...

1130
01:16:56,786 --> 01:16:59,571
But it's about
4 stories up.

1131
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:00,659
Let me do it.

1132
01:17:00,703 --> 01:17:03,227
Nah, nah. I gave it
to somebody else.

1133
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:04,402
Come on.

1134
01:17:04,445 --> 01:17:05,316
I'm not scared to do
anything you give me,

1135
01:17:05,359 --> 01:17:06,230
and you know it.

1136
01:17:06,273 --> 01:17:07,231
See, that's what
pisses me off

1137
01:17:07,274 --> 01:17:08,145
about you young punks.

1138
01:17:08,188 --> 01:17:09,842
You think
you're invincible.

1139
01:17:09,886 --> 01:17:10,974
You know, then
you get fearless.

1140
01:17:11,017 --> 01:17:13,193
Then you get reckless.
Then you get dead.

1141
01:17:13,237 --> 01:17:14,107
Look, I'm just sayin'...

1142
01:17:14,151 --> 01:17:15,369
No, I don't care
what you say.

1143
01:17:15,413 --> 01:17:16,588
What I'm saying
is you ain't dying
on my set.

1144
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:17,589
All this talk
about dying,

1145
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:19,069
you ain't dying
on my set.

1146
01:17:19,112 --> 01:17:20,070
You understand that?

1147
01:17:20,113 --> 01:17:21,724
I'm just sayin'
that I trust you,

1148
01:17:21,767 --> 01:17:24,248
and I know with you there
takin' care of things,

1149
01:17:24,291 --> 01:17:25,336
I can do it.

1150
01:17:25,379 --> 01:17:27,643
Yeah.

1151
01:17:29,122 --> 01:17:30,210
And by the way,

1152
01:17:30,254 --> 01:17:31,168
if you meant
all that shit

1153
01:17:31,211 --> 01:17:32,909
about gettin' back
in the saddle,

1154
01:17:32,952 --> 01:17:35,128
you need this, too.

1155
01:17:37,914 --> 01:17:41,657
Look, just watch
the football, will ya?

1156
01:17:42,919 --> 01:17:44,747
Why?

1157
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:46,096
I have to know.

1158
01:17:46,139 --> 01:17:47,575
What? What do you
have to know...

1159
01:17:47,619 --> 01:17:52,015
That you can
get yourself killed
like Jimmy?

1160
01:17:54,278 --> 01:17:57,455
God, you're all alike.

1161
01:17:58,021 --> 01:18:00,850
It's your fucking ego.

1162
01:18:05,289 --> 01:18:08,248
Thanks for
watchin' out for me.

1163
01:18:12,775 --> 01:18:14,385
[Door closes]

1164
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:21,392
Shit.

1165
01:18:29,182 --> 01:18:31,576
It's time.

1166
01:18:46,025 --> 01:18:47,984
Lance: I told him not to put
that camera so close

1167
01:18:48,027 --> 01:18:49,986
to the goddamn boxes.

1168
01:18:50,029 --> 01:18:51,378
Eric: Hey.
What?

1169
01:18:51,422 --> 01:18:53,859
Ain't I the one that's
supposed to be nervous?

1170
01:18:53,903 --> 01:18:54,860
I'm not nervous.

1171
01:18:54,904 --> 01:18:56,514
I mean, your ass
is goin' 60 feet,

1172
01:18:56,557 --> 01:18:57,428
and I'm pushin' the button,

1173
01:18:57,471 --> 01:19:00,170
so, you know,
I'm not nervous.

1174
01:19:00,213 --> 01:19:01,911
Right.

1175
01:19:01,954 --> 01:19:03,303
Graham...

1176
01:19:03,347 --> 01:19:04,652
We're about ready
up here.

1177
01:19:04,696 --> 01:19:05,784
How's it goin' down there?

1178
01:19:05,828 --> 01:19:08,787
We're good to go.

1179
01:19:08,831 --> 01:19:11,007
Lance: Come on.

1180
01:19:25,717 --> 01:19:29,199
You...you just concentrate
on gettin' off good

1181
01:19:29,242 --> 01:19:30,287
just like you been doin',

1182
01:19:30,330 --> 01:19:32,202
you'll clear this alley
real easy,

1183
01:19:32,245 --> 01:19:35,683
and leave the rest
to me, right?

1184
01:19:38,121 --> 01:19:39,992
Close your eyes.

1185
01:19:43,604 --> 01:19:46,694
You know,
this here one will, uh,

1186
01:19:46,738 --> 01:19:49,697
separate the men
from the boys.

1187
01:19:49,741 --> 01:19:53,614
Well, that's why I know
you're gonna kick ass, son.

1188
01:19:56,313 --> 01:19:57,444
Thanks.

1189
01:19:57,488 --> 01:19:59,142
Assistant director:
We're all set, Lance.

1190
01:19:59,185 --> 01:20:00,230
It's your call.

1191
01:20:00,273 --> 01:20:01,884
Let's go.

1192
01:20:13,591 --> 01:20:15,898
Time to get airborne,
buddy.

1193
01:20:16,724 --> 01:20:17,638
Let's do it.

1194
01:20:17,682 --> 01:20:18,726
Roll cameras.

1195
01:20:18,770 --> 01:20:22,818
[Whispering]
Let's do it. Let's do it.

1196
01:20:29,912 --> 01:20:31,391
Come on.

1197
01:20:31,435 --> 01:20:34,264
And all cameras
are rolling.

1198
01:20:34,307 --> 01:20:36,309
Let's do it, Eric.

1199
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:50,976
Assistant director:
And cut.

1200
01:20:53,761 --> 01:20:54,719
Hey, are you ok,
Eric?

1201
01:20:54,762 --> 01:20:58,027
Yeah. Just let me
catch my breath.

1202
01:20:58,070 --> 01:20:58,766
Here.

1203
01:20:58,810 --> 01:20:59,898
Sometimes
these boxes

1204
01:20:59,942 --> 01:21:01,857
aren't that
forgiving, are they?

1205
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:03,032
You can say that again.

1206
01:21:03,075 --> 01:21:04,120
[Graham laughs]

1207
01:21:04,163 --> 01:21:06,339
You were definitely
airborne, brother.

1208
01:21:06,383 --> 01:21:07,645
[Chuckles]

1209
01:21:07,688 --> 01:21:09,821
Man, I'm just glad
you listened
to Lance.

1210
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:12,824
What do you mean?

1211
01:21:15,783 --> 01:21:16,828
Jimmy didn't.

1212
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:18,482
When we found
the air ram,

1213
01:21:18,525 --> 01:21:19,744
the Gauge was smashed,

1214
01:21:19,787 --> 01:21:21,311
and the needle was stuck
higher than we set it.

1215
01:21:21,354 --> 01:21:22,529
Jimmy doubled
the pressure

1216
01:21:22,573 --> 01:21:24,183
without telling anyone.

1217
01:21:24,227 --> 01:21:26,664
If he would have
just listened to Lance
and not changed a thing,

1218
01:21:26,707 --> 01:21:28,666
he'd still be alive.

1219
01:21:30,668 --> 01:21:31,930
But you did it right.

1220
01:21:31,974 --> 01:21:37,718
[Crew whoops, cheers]

1221
01:21:49,252 --> 01:21:50,514
[Knock on door]

1222
01:21:50,557 --> 01:21:53,038
Great shot, hotshot.
You got 'em all talking.

1223
01:21:53,082 --> 01:21:54,170
Let's celebrate.

1224
01:21:54,213 --> 01:21:56,955
First tell me why
you covered for Jimmy.

1225
01:21:56,999 --> 01:21:58,957
What are you talking about?

1226
01:21:59,001 --> 01:22:00,132
You know
what I'm talking about.

1227
01:22:00,176 --> 01:22:03,396
Why didn't you tell me?

1228
01:22:05,921 --> 01:22:08,749
I, uh, I really didn't
have any reason to.

1229
01:22:08,793 --> 01:22:09,968
I mean, I guess
I should have,

1230
01:22:10,012 --> 01:22:12,449
but I was asking you
to trust me.

1231
01:22:12,492 --> 01:22:15,974
I really didn't want
to tarnish the kid's name.

1232
01:22:16,018 --> 01:22:18,020
He was a...He was
a real good stunt man,

1233
01:22:18,063 --> 01:22:21,240
but he didn't listen
sometimes, you know?

1234
01:22:21,284 --> 01:22:23,068
So, he increased
the pressure?

1235
01:22:23,112 --> 01:22:24,330
Yeah.

1236
01:22:24,374 --> 01:22:25,897
See, I knew he had family
in New York,

1237
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:29,422
and if the insurance
investigators found out

1238
01:22:29,466 --> 01:22:31,250
that he was tampering
with that ram, well,

1239
01:22:31,294 --> 01:22:32,382
they would have
found him at fault

1240
01:22:32,425 --> 01:22:35,907
and not given him
any benefits.

1241
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:37,387
You took the blame.

1242
01:22:37,430 --> 01:22:40,129
I got nothin'
to prove anymore.

1243
01:22:40,172 --> 01:22:42,479
What the hell
did it matter?

1244
01:22:42,522 --> 01:22:43,654
Enough of this shit.
Listen.

1245
01:22:43,697 --> 01:22:45,047
You go home
and get yourself
some sleep.

1246
01:22:45,090 --> 01:22:46,178
We'll celebrate tomorrow.

1247
01:22:46,222 --> 01:22:47,049
