00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:31,759
<i>...takes its way</i>

2
00:01:31,793 --> 00:01:34,261
<i>and goes the length</i>
<i>of the floor and...</i>

3
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,831
Pan Am Terminal O' Hare Airport.

4
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:38,398
You got it.

5
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,201
- Could you turn that up?
- Alright.

6
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:44,271
<i>Michael Jordan, 42 points,</i>

7
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:47,508
<i>13 off 26,</i>
<i>from the field,</i>

8
00:01:47,542 --> 00:01:48,876
<i>with nine assist.</i>

9
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:52,312
<i>Bulls defeat the Pistons,</i>
<i>108, 101 to...</i>

10
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:54,114
Well, they're gonna do it
this year.

11
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:57,184
That Michael Jordan can
do things

12
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,621
I've never seen any other
player do in my life

13
00:01:59,654 --> 00:02:01,254
I mean, ever.

14
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:05,325
Yeah, he's a-- a great player,

15
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,196
but plenty of fellas came
before Mike that could do things

16
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,865
you've never seen
in your life.

17
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:12,934
-Like who?
-I'm talking 'bout...

18
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,902
Connie Hawkins,

19
00:02:14,936 --> 00:02:18,640
Elgin Baylor,
Julius Erving,

20
00:02:18,673 --> 00:02:20,808
Dr. J in the Hawk.

21
00:02:20,842 --> 00:02:21,909
Yeah, I hear you.

22
00:02:21,943 --> 00:02:25,813
That style of play
goes way back.

23
00:02:25,847 --> 00:02:28,248
Like David Thompson,
Oscar Robinson way back,

24
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:31,251
or we like,
talking where the hell back?

25
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,922
You know your basketball.

26
00:02:34,956 --> 00:02:37,324
Sports writing is the life
for me.

27
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,894
- Alright.
- What about you?

28
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:42,429
What's your excuse?

29
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:43,731
I know my game.

30
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:47,434
Listen, pal,
we got a bit of a drive here,

31
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:51,371
so, why don't you tell me
more about your game?

32
00:02:52,907 --> 00:02:56,678
A lot of people don't know,
how it went down.

33
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:07,588
The highly anticipated rematch
between the Globetrotters

34
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:10,525
and the NBA champ
Minneapolis Lakers,

35
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:12,627
is turning out to be
the game of the century, Marty.

36
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,394
That's right, Howard.
And even though the Lakers

37
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:15,963
had a commanding lead in the
first half,

38
00:03:15,997 --> 00:03:17,297
the trotters have come back

39
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,866
in these exciting final minutes.

40
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,969
Much of the damage has come
from one player in particular,

41
00:03:22,003 --> 00:03:24,304
and that's Sweetwater Clifton,

42
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,641
who has had a spectacular game
tonight,

43
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:30,377
battling against
the Laker giant, George Mikan.

44
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,513
Come on. Straight coming!

45
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:33,280
Sweets! Sweets!

46
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,616
Yeah, do that!
Sweets, good job!

47
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,851
I got mine right here.

48
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,452
Oh, that's a foul!

49
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:39,821
Ahan, aha!

50
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:42,924
George Mikan gets blocked!

51
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:44,525
I've never seen that before!

52
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:47,360
I don't think anybody
has seen that before, Howard.

53
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,563
Attack!

54
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,365
And it's a tie game, folks!

55
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,836
Sweets! Boom chick-a-boom!

56
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:56,336
Now!

57
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:57,370
- You got to move.
- Pass the ball, will you?

58
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,874
-Move right, move right.
-Pass the ball, will you?

59
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,743
Here come the Trotters.

60
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:03,276
I got my man right here.

61
00:04:04,779 --> 00:04:06,313
Okay, okay.

62
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:09,382
What in the world is going on
at mid court?

63
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,686
Marcus Haynes is doing things
with that basketball

64
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,521
no one has done before!

65
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:18,526
Here you go! Here you go!

66
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,031
Yeah!

67
00:04:24,065 --> 00:04:25,398
You got it right there.

68
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,466
Come on, Mike, get in!

69
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:28,536
You're a tree!
Get in his way!

70
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:31,739
Oh nice, nice, nice...

71
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,510
Irish, did you see that?

72
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:37,377
Have you ever seen anything
like that before?

73
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,781
No, you haven't, because
it hasn't happened prior!

74
00:04:39,814 --> 00:04:41,616
My boys are the best,
you know that, right?

75
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:43,885
Yeah, everybody knows it, Abe,
especially you.

76
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:47,387
- I got my man right here.
- Come on, Joe.

77
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,388
- Yes, I got him.
- You got him?

78
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,423
- Hey, hey, hey! Yeah!
- We've got to...

79
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:51,358
Oh, steal...

80
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,728
Look at the size
of Sweetwater's hands,

81
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:56,463
he makes the ball look like
a grapefruit.

82
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,398
-Uh huh.
-He could play defense.

83
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,367
By the way,
we all know that blocks

84
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,771
and rebounds win games. Right?

85
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:04,906
Yeah. Well, it's--

86
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:07,407
It's like a circus, though.
It's Ringling brothers.

87
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,677
Yeah, well, everyone's here
to see that.

88
00:05:11,746 --> 00:05:13,581
I think there's a lot more
to this cager

89
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:15,616
than just blocks
and rebounds.

90
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,719
Alright. Hey, hey, hey!

91
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:25,960
And the Globetrotters
defeat the NBA champion,

92
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,628
Minneapolis Lakers.

93
00:05:27,662 --> 00:05:30,565
Final score 49-45.

94
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:31,966
Who are the champs?
We're the champs!

95
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,568
Who won this?
We're the champs!

96
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:35,102
We're the champs!
We're the champs!

97
00:05:35,136 --> 00:05:36,771
We're the champs!
We're the champs!

98
00:05:37,972 --> 00:05:39,640
Way to go, guys!

99
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:41,374
Man, what a way to bring it
to 'em!

100
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:42,610
Now everybody knows

101
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,579
who's the best
in the world?

102
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:45,980
You're gonna have to phone
the missus, tell her

103
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,648
you scored double digits
tonight.

104
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:52,553
Looks like you had some fun
out there tonight.

105
00:05:52,587 --> 00:05:53,486
Always do.

106
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:55,089
No, you made it look easy.

107
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:56,524
Joe Lapchick.

108
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:57,758
Nat Clifton.

109
00:05:57,792 --> 00:05:59,060
Some call me "Sweetwater".

110
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:00,761
- Hey, let's go, guys.
- Abe's waiting.

111
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:02,897
And we don't wanna hear
his big mouth.

112
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:08,769
I coach a team called
"The New York Knickerbockers".

113
00:06:10,171 --> 00:06:11,806
Dick McGuire is on your team?

114
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,007
Yes, he is.

115
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,108
He can shoot that ball.

116
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:16,443
Yes, he can.

117
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:20,047
Ain't no negros play
in your league.

118
00:06:20,081 --> 00:06:21,649
That ain't no secret.

119
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:28,990
It's not gonna be like that
forever.

120
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:33,694
I think that you can help
make the change.

121
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:36,496
No, no, no.
No, no, I mean that.

122
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:39,634
You can be the first.

123
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:45,606
Great game tonight.

124
00:06:47,008 --> 00:06:49,143
I'll catch you later,
Sweetwater.

125
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:51,579
Thanks, yeah.

126
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:52,914
See you around, Mr. Lapchick.

127
00:06:52,947 --> 00:06:54,414
Please call me "Joe".

128
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:23,476
Ow!

129
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:25,513
Let's see. Go to mom.

130
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:27,148
-But Dad...
-Go to Mom!

131
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:28,816
Ow!

132
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:39,760
A little bit of sugar

133
00:07:39,794 --> 00:07:42,029
makes the water taste
so much sweeter.

134
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:55,475
Come here.

135
00:07:56,277 --> 00:07:57,745
Come here.

136
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,215
From this day on,

137
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:03,918
your name is not
Clifton Nathaniel.

138
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:05,586
No more.

139
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:08,222
It's Nathaniel Clifton,
you understand?

140
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:10,124
Yes, Momma.

141
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,993
Okay. Now, Nat Clifton.

142
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:15,096
It's time to go.

143
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:16,263
But Momma...

144
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:17,898
Now you listen to your momma
now.

145
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,901
Go on, and get on that horse
and buggy.

146
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:24,271
Hey, your Daddy taking you
into the big city.

147
00:08:24,305 --> 00:08:26,774
Where you can have
a better life.

148
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:30,277
He gonna take good care
of you.

149
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:32,279
Yeah?

150
00:08:32,313 --> 00:08:33,914
But Momma,
I don't wanna leave.

151
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:35,816
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

152
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:39,954
Take these hands,
God gifted you with.

153
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:42,056
You put them to good use.

154
00:08:43,591 --> 00:08:45,159
I always knew,

155
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,795
you was born
with a higher purpose.

156
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:52,066
You just got to believe.

157
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:53,701
Yeah?

158
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,038
I love you, baby.

159
00:08:57,071 --> 00:08:59,206
I love you, Mom.

160
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,674
Come.

161
00:09:02,977 --> 00:09:04,011
Okay, now go.

162
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:05,346
Go.

163
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:58,232
Hey, good game, Sweets!

164
00:09:58,265 --> 00:09:59,333
Good game, Sweets!

165
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:12,413
Hey Sweets...

166
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:18,018
Did you see Mikan's face
when you blocked his shot?

167
00:10:22,857 --> 00:10:24,425
Fellows, we might be sleeping
here tonight,

168
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,228
but first,
it's pay time.

169
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,030
Excellent job.

170
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:32,399
Thank you so very much
for what you do.

171
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:33,434
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

172
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,401
Thank you.

173
00:10:34,435 --> 00:10:36,937
Looking great out there,
honestly and truly.

174
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:38,739
- Thanks, Abe.
- Thank you.

175
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,275
- There's Pops.
- Thanks, Abe.

176
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,744
And last,
but certainly not least,

177
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:46,080
thank you.

178
00:10:48,249 --> 00:10:49,216
Ahan.

179
00:10:50,351 --> 00:10:51,986
What?

180
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,454
Oh, don't give me that look,
Sweetwater.

181
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,422
You got something to say,
just say it to my face.

182
00:10:55,456 --> 00:10:57,057
I can take it,
spit it out.

183
00:10:57,091 --> 00:11:00,127
We beat them Lakers.

184
00:11:00,161 --> 00:11:01,295
The NBA champs.

185
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,297
Yeah, we certainly did.

186
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,966
It wasn't easy, honey.

187
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,169
No. No, it wasn't.

188
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:09,770
They're the... best.

189
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:12,840
So, we didn't expect it
to be easy.

190
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,175
And if I guess it
ain't my business

191
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:16,310
how much they get paid?

192
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,112
It's none of your beeswax.

193
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:21,081
You're not hearing what
I'm saying, Abe.

194
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,919
I would say everyone is hearing
what you're saying loud

195
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:25,886
and clear.

196
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:29,890
And on behalf of Sweetwater,

197
00:11:29,924 --> 00:11:32,359
I would like to further thank
each

198
00:11:32,393 --> 00:11:35,062
and everyone of you out
of my own.

199
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:39,300
Take from tonight,
'cause you earned it.

200
00:11:40,334 --> 00:11:41,869
Sorry.

201
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:44,004
-Alright.
-Don't miss it.

202
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:45,306
Extra cabbage.

203
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:49,877
Fellows I got big plans
more importantly,

204
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,113
tonight's win allows us
to now travel the world

205
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:54,949
with your talent.

206
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:57,985
South America, Europe,
all the way to China.

207
00:11:58,018 --> 00:12:00,821
Places you've only dreamt about.

208
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:03,257
Internationally known
Globetrotters.

209
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,426
Bigger than Jesse Owens.

210
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:06,293
- Right?
- Hmmm.

211
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:08,229
- That's right.
- Joe Lewis.

212
00:12:09,263 --> 00:12:11,966
They're just gonna be talking
about you now.

213
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:15,135
And I got new plays,
new routines you're gonna love.

214
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:16,303
And one day,

215
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:21,742
one day,
we're gonna be an NBA team.

216
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:30,084
Get some rest.

217
00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:33,354
We're going to change the
world, Abe.

218
00:12:33,387 --> 00:12:34,755
Yeah, that's right.

219
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,093
Thanks, brother.

220
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:47,234
This is your opportunity
to level the playing field.

221
00:12:47,268 --> 00:12:48,402
Give these boys a chance
and let's get them on the court!

222
00:12:49,537 --> 00:12:51,305
This is not a Negro league!

223
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:53,874
- And never will be! Come on!
- I second the

224
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:54,676
-gentleman's opinion.
-What are you talking about?!

225
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:56,377
-Whoa, whoa, easy.
-Yes, thank you.

226
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,078
Easy!

227
00:12:58,112 --> 00:13:00,881
What's with all the yelling?

228
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:04,151
Now, I think we should proceed
with a...

229
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:07,154
with an atmosphere
of respect, okay.

230
00:13:07,187 --> 00:13:08,289
And decorum.

231
00:13:09,557 --> 00:13:11,892
And as
for Mr. Walter Brown's inquiry

232
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:15,863
regarding drafting Negro
players for the Celtics,

233
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:17,898
the bylaws are clear.

234
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:20,502
You are not limited
to whites only.

235
00:13:20,535 --> 00:13:22,570
It says players.

236
00:13:22,604 --> 00:13:24,071
Players.

237
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:26,440
So, anyone of you wants
to draft a negro player,

238
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:27,709
go be my guest.

239
00:13:27,742 --> 00:13:32,212
The Celtics are very interested
in drafting a negro player.

240
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:33,314
-And...
-Out!

241
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:34,516
Alright.

242
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:36,917
I'd like to speak out
on behalf of my team

243
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,185
and our interest in this league

244
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:41,922
when I say it's unnecessary
to have all this razzle dazzle,

245
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:43,090
hot dog,
and bull crap on our courts.

246
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:46,260
And that's what
the negro players will do.

247
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:49,296
Can I-- can I just say something
for a change here, okay?

248
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,598
Just listen to me.

249
00:13:50,632 --> 00:13:52,232
I think I can personally
guarantee

250
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:55,537
that no one in this room
loves basketball more than I do.

251
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,137
Oh, come on, stop!

252
00:13:57,171 --> 00:13:59,239
Yes, that's right!
And this stuff you call,

253
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:00,474
"razzle dazzle",

254
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:02,409
well, I find it exciting,

255
00:14:02,443 --> 00:14:04,445
and quite honestly,
entertaining.

256
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:06,947
Like...
like a dance!

257
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,349
-Oh, like a dance?
-Yes, like a dance.

258
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:09,950
Oh, it's-- it's a dance.

259
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:11,185
-Yes, a dance!
-Okay. Thank you very much.

260
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:13,387
They're supposed to put points
on the board,

261
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,155
and paying customers
in the seat.

262
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:18,892
Because, basketball after all
is a business.

263
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:20,494
Or haven't you heard?

264
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:21,962
Let's take a vote.

265
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:25,299
Hm? A gentlemen's agreement
if you will.

266
00:14:25,332 --> 00:14:29,236
I move that the NBA is
for white players only.

267
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:31,606
Ahh... I uh...

268
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:34,208
I want to be on record
to saying,

269
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:37,244
that it's a mistake
to go on record with that.

270
00:14:43,685 --> 00:14:45,119
I reiterate.

271
00:14:46,554 --> 00:14:49,022
I move that the NBA

272
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:52,059
is for white players only.

273
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:53,327
I second!

274
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,530
Thank you.

275
00:14:55,563 --> 00:14:57,398
Okay, there's a motion
on the table.

276
00:14:57,431 --> 00:14:58,399
It says uh,

277
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:01,301
the NBA wants to remain
an all white league.

278
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:03,505
All those in favor,
please say aye.

279
00:15:03,538 --> 00:15:04,405
-Aye!
-Aye.

280
00:15:04,438 --> 00:15:05,372
Those opposed?

281
00:15:05,406 --> 00:15:06,708
Nay.

282
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:08,242
You guys have it.

283
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,445
Did you stand--
did you stand up?

284
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:12,680
I tried. Of course, I did.

285
00:15:12,714 --> 00:15:14,716
- Did you?
- What do you think?

286
00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:17,117
-Of course, I did.
-Who-- who made the decision?

287
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:19,554
-Podoloff?
-Him, board of governors,

288
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:20,354
-team owner--
-Oh!

289
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:22,322
It was kind of unanimous,
actually.

290
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:24,726
The-- the NBA champs

291
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:27,595
got their asses kicked
by an all-negro team. Okay!

292
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:30,164
Well, if memory serves me well,
it was a pretty close game.

293
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:32,032
Okay.

294
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:35,703
If the Trotters had a franchise
in this league,

295
00:15:35,737 --> 00:15:37,572
there isn't a team
in the NBA

296
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:38,606
that could beat them.

297
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,107
I know.

298
00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:44,044
It's not my decision, okay?

299
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,582
It is what it is, Joe.

300
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:49,416
It doesn't have to be that way.

301
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:53,086
But what do you wanna do?

302
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:57,759
I'm starting to think
this is where I resign.

303
00:15:57,792 --> 00:15:59,460
Oh, that's smart.

304
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:01,061
That's really smart.

305
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:02,262
Now that we have
the ingredients

306
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:04,231
for a championship team,
you wanna quit?

307
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:06,099
Huh?

308
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:09,036
These kids are counting on you
to take them to the finals.

309
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:11,071
You wanna let them down?

310
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:12,707
Go ahead, tell 'em. Go ahead.

311
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,141
Alright, alright.

312
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,176
-Yeah.
-Okay.

313
00:16:23,785 --> 00:16:25,787
Alright,
let's work our rebounds.

314
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,254
Let's go, guys!

315
00:16:27,287 --> 00:16:29,389
Line it up.

316
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,702
Babe!

317
00:16:40,735 --> 00:16:42,704
Goose!

318
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:46,608
There it is.

319
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,478
Yeah! I got him! I got him!

320
00:16:51,513 --> 00:16:52,647
Oh yeah, I got him, I got him.

321
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,147
I got him! I got him!

322
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:56,450
I got him! I got him!

323
00:16:56,483 --> 00:16:57,652
No, that's 2-2 on the whole.

324
00:16:57,685 --> 00:16:59,286
Whoa! What? Wait! What?

325
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:00,555
Yeah, that's called "a foul".

326
00:17:00,588 --> 00:17:01,756
You called it on me?

327
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:03,525
Yes, sir. You're 2-2.

328
00:17:03,558 --> 00:17:04,826
Alright, I'm sorry, Ref.

329
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:05,727
-Alright. Give me the ball--
-Here you go, bud.

330
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:08,530
Thank you, sir.

331
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:13,267
What the hell kind of call
is that?

332
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,269
-You don't want it that way?
-That's fine. It's fine.

333
00:17:15,904 --> 00:17:17,170
White ball.

334
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,474
Alright. Come on, now.

335
00:17:20,508 --> 00:17:21,776
Hey, hey! Alright, alright.

336
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:23,277
Hey, hey, hey.

337
00:17:24,612 --> 00:17:26,313
Keep going, keep going.

338
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:30,117
Hey!

339
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,302
Got my hat on.

340
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:19,466
That damn clutch, again?

341
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:21,869
No, that's the sound
of an empty tank.

342
00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:23,671
Forgot to fill up
in the city.

343
00:18:38,953 --> 00:18:39,921
So, I did my part tonight.

344
00:18:39,954 --> 00:18:41,288
So, who got bag duty,
'cause it ain't me.

345
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:42,924
- Not me.
- Not it. Not it.

346
00:18:42,957 --> 00:18:44,491
- It ain't me.
- I think it's the person

347
00:18:44,525 --> 00:18:46,259
with the least amounts of points
tonight.

348
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,662
Yeah, so...

349
00:18:47,695 --> 00:18:48,796
- Who is that?
- Ohhh...

350
00:18:49,931 --> 00:18:52,399
Ohhh!

351
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:54,334
- Alright, man. Alright, I'll--
- I'll get the bags.

352
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:55,503
That's right. Nice move.

353
00:19:05,546 --> 00:19:07,214
Step away, boy.

354
00:19:13,988 --> 00:19:16,658
You need to move away
from my lily-white pumps,

355
00:19:16,691 --> 00:19:17,725
nigger.

356
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:21,495
We mean no harm, sir.

357
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:24,431
All we need is some gas,
so, we can get on our way.

358
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:28,268
You're a brave one talking back.

359
00:19:29,804 --> 00:19:31,304
You see this gun?

360
00:19:32,006 --> 00:19:33,574
It's loaded.

361
00:19:34,709 --> 00:19:36,678
I know how to use it.

362
00:19:36,711 --> 00:19:38,579
Let me tell you somethin'.

363
00:19:38,613 --> 00:19:40,247
I've used it before.

364
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,551
Like I said,
we need some gas.

365
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:44,852
The tank is dry as dust.

366
00:19:44,886 --> 00:19:48,455
Mm-hmm. And if I let you
pump some gas,

367
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:50,591
how you gonna pay for it,
boy?

368
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:01,368
Your money ain't no good here.

369
00:20:03,705 --> 00:20:07,274
Well, now who doesn't love
American cold hard cash, sir?

370
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:09,342
Abe Saperstein at your service.

371
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:11,311
Allow me to introduce

372
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:13,781
the gentleman that you're
somewhat pointing that,

373
00:20:13,815 --> 00:20:15,348
powerful looking weapon
at...

374
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:18,251
This is basketball legend!

375
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:19,987
Nat Sweetwater Clifton.

376
00:20:20,021 --> 00:20:21,889
One of the stars
of the Globetrotters,

377
00:20:21,923 --> 00:20:24,525
the world renowned
Globetrotters.

378
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,994
We just uh, need a couple of
gallons of your gas, sir.

379
00:20:27,028 --> 00:20:28,563
We'll be on our way.
In fact, I see

380
00:20:28,596 --> 00:20:30,598
the prices have doubled,
which we're happy to pay.

381
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:33,735
Youse that negro basketball
team?

382
00:20:33,768 --> 00:20:34,902
You are a clever one, sir.

383
00:20:34,936 --> 00:20:37,038
Yes, we'se are
except myself, of course.

384
00:20:37,071 --> 00:20:38,673
I coach the team.

385
00:20:51,786 --> 00:20:53,353
Right uh...

386
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:55,656
To Jen, my girlfriend,
on this side.

387
00:20:57,525 --> 00:20:59,560
Sure. Let me just see if there's
a pen on the bus, sir.

388
00:20:59,594 --> 00:21:02,830
Oh, well I've got this,
I do signs with.

389
00:21:02,864 --> 00:21:03,998
-There we are.
-Here you go.

390
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:05,566
That'll work.

391
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,768
Yes, indeed.

392
00:21:06,801 --> 00:21:08,703
Be happy to do that.

393
00:21:08,736 --> 00:21:09,937
That's uh...

394
00:21:09,971 --> 00:21:12,039
That's gonna have some value
on the open market right away,

395
00:21:12,073 --> 00:21:14,374
but if you hold on to it,

396
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:17,310
like a piano or real estate,
or a painting,

397
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:20,548
that will go up in value
over time.

398
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:21,414
Yes, indeed.

399
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:22,717
Y'all play a game today?

400
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,787
- We did!
- Yes, yes, a great game!

401
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,988
And even better crowd!

402
00:21:27,021 --> 00:21:28,656
Weren't they something,
Sweetwater?

403
00:21:29,891 --> 00:21:32,860
Yup, some of the better
basketball fans we've seen.

404
00:21:32,894 --> 00:21:34,729
Good local folk you have here,
sir.

405
00:21:34,762 --> 00:21:37,397
Yeah, but terrific
local team, too,

406
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,366
if you had the pleasure of
seeing them play--

407
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:41,401
I'll tell you what?
It'll be an honor of mine to

408
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:42,703
provide you
with the finest seats

409
00:21:42,737 --> 00:21:43,470
in the house for yourself.

410
00:21:43,504 --> 00:21:44,972
The missus and the kids,
next time

411
00:21:45,006 --> 00:21:46,941
the Globetrotters pass through
your

412
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:48,643
warm and inviting county.

413
00:21:49,744 --> 00:21:51,311
Who won that game today?

414
00:21:55,716 --> 00:21:58,853
Well, who do you think
won the game?

415
00:22:01,856 --> 00:22:03,658
Thank you for the autograph.

416
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:08,629
That went well.

417
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,569
Just get back in the bus.

418
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:13,928
Uh, I'm sorry, we have
absolutely no rooms available.

419
00:23:15,096 --> 00:23:17,497
You have no rooms?

420
00:23:17,531 --> 00:23:19,533
This is our busiest
time of year.

421
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:21,535
Yeah, I can see that.

422
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,839
A lot of keys there behind you.

423
00:23:24,872 --> 00:23:27,575
You sure you don't wanna take
one more look

424
00:23:27,608 --> 00:23:29,977
to see if there are any rooms?

425
00:23:30,011 --> 00:23:32,947
Ah, it'd be a waste of time,
sir.

426
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:37,852
I'll tell you what, you should
check out The Dunbar.

427
00:23:37,885 --> 00:23:39,186
They're right across town.

428
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,022
I'm sure they'd be willing
to accommodate you.

429
00:23:42,823 --> 00:23:44,558
Across town, huh?

430
00:23:44,592 --> 00:23:46,527
Yeah.

431
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,829
What about him?
Is he at the Dunbar, too?

432
00:23:48,863 --> 00:23:51,032
Oh no. He's here, sir.

433
00:23:51,065 --> 00:23:53,234
-What?
-Yeah, Mr. Bananas,

434
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:55,102
he's-- he's staying with us.

435
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,537
Yeah, he's just working
at the theatre

436
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:57,838
-right across the street.
-Is that right?

437
00:23:57,872 --> 00:24:00,608
-Yeah.
-And he's got his own room here?

438
00:24:04,078 --> 00:24:05,478
Well, he...

439
00:24:05,513 --> 00:24:07,248
Him and his trainer.

440
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:11,052
Sure. Somebody's got to order
the room service, right?

441
00:24:11,085 --> 00:24:13,421
Let me see if I understand this.

442
00:24:15,156 --> 00:24:17,692
Mr. Bananas,
this chimp is so talented,

443
00:24:17,725 --> 00:24:19,260
he's named
after the food he eats,

444
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:20,428
whereas my fellas,

445
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,898
who are the most talented
basketball players in the world,

446
00:24:23,931 --> 00:24:25,599
they've got no room here.

447
00:24:27,535 --> 00:24:31,038
Look uh, I don't make the
rules,

448
00:24:31,072 --> 00:24:32,506
okay?

449
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,674
Times like this...

450
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:34,642
Hmmm.
...wish the hell I did.

451
00:24:34,675 --> 00:24:36,277
Yeah, you don't make the rules.

452
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:39,981
You just follow 'em,
like at Nuremberg.

453
00:24:40,014 --> 00:24:41,983
Does that ring a bell?

454
00:24:42,016 --> 00:24:43,084
Let's go, fellas.

455
00:24:44,251 --> 00:24:45,553
Wish you luck.

456
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:01,035
That was very yummy, mom.

457
00:25:01,068 --> 00:25:03,004
I'm so glad you liked it,
sweetie.

458
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:05,973
Dad, may I be excused?

459
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,882
It's okay.

460
00:25:28,596 --> 00:25:31,032
Have never seen you
so distraught.

461
00:25:34,168 --> 00:25:35,669
It's the wall.

462
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:38,773
What wall?

463
00:25:38,806 --> 00:25:40,307
Ugh.

464
00:25:40,341 --> 00:25:42,610
That Sweetwater Clifton
represents everything

465
00:25:42,643 --> 00:25:44,645
that I have been fighting for,
you know that.

466
00:25:44,678 --> 00:25:46,814
The guy is the future
of basketball,

467
00:25:46,847 --> 00:25:51,252
and there is this wall,
that the league built,

468
00:25:51,285 --> 00:25:53,320
and he won't be able
to break through it.

469
00:25:53,354 --> 00:25:55,322
Alright?

470
00:25:55,356 --> 00:25:58,859
By the time he does,
we'll be grandparents.

471
00:26:05,966 --> 00:26:07,101
Look at me.

472
00:26:09,036 --> 00:26:11,038
You are Joe Lapchick.

473
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,973
Yeah.

474
00:26:13,007 --> 00:26:15,009
You don't have to break
through a wall.

475
00:26:16,744 --> 00:26:18,779
You just go get Sweetwater,

476
00:26:18,813 --> 00:26:21,715
and you climb over that wall
with him.

477
00:27:57,144 --> 00:27:59,046
I don't remember ordering
room service.

478
00:28:00,414 --> 00:28:01,415
I didn't mean to wake you.

479
00:28:01,448 --> 00:28:03,751
No, no, that's okay.

480
00:28:03,784 --> 00:28:04,885
I don't ever really sleep.

481
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:07,254
Ah, well,
at least your team is awake.

482
00:28:07,288 --> 00:28:08,189
Right?

483
00:28:08,222 --> 00:28:10,391
We should take this up
to the Catskills.

484
00:28:10,424 --> 00:28:13,327
Saperstein and Lapchick,
some Lapshtick, right?

485
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,396
-That's good.
-You know?

486
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:17,398
To what do I owe the pleasure?

487
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:19,033
Listen, I know you're not
fully conscious,

488
00:28:19,066 --> 00:28:21,368
but I would just love
to pitch you something.

489
00:28:21,402 --> 00:28:23,237
If you got a minute.

490
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:26,140
Ah, bring the Globetrotters
back to the garden.

491
00:28:26,173 --> 00:28:27,474
I don't think so.

492
00:28:27,509 --> 00:28:29,443
Huh.
They'll sell it out again.

493
00:28:29,476 --> 00:28:31,145
No, we sold out,

494
00:28:31,178 --> 00:28:34,815
because it was the NBA champion
Lakers playing the Trotters,

495
00:28:34,848 --> 00:28:36,350
for an unofficial
world championship.

496
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:37,818
It was a bragging rights, Joe.

497
00:28:37,851 --> 00:28:40,821
The fans did not come out
to see the Lakers.

498
00:28:40,854 --> 00:28:43,023
They paid their money
to see the Trotters,

499
00:28:43,057 --> 00:28:44,391
'cause
that's great entertainment.

500
00:28:44,425 --> 00:28:45,826
Other than
the Ringling brothers,

501
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:47,928
we don't sell tickets,
you know that.

502
00:28:47,962 --> 00:28:49,363
Trotters sell out everywhere
they go.

503
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:51,332
Yeah, in the boondocks, Joe.

504
00:28:51,365 --> 00:28:52,499
Tiny gyms.

505
00:28:52,534 --> 00:28:54,802
This is no comparison
to the garden.

506
00:28:57,871 --> 00:28:59,507
- This is Ned.
<i>- Hi Ned, it's Mickey.</i>

507
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:01,141
Oh hey, Mickey,
what's going on?

508
00:29:01,175 --> 00:29:05,179
What if the Trotters played
an All-Star college team?

509
00:29:05,212 --> 00:29:07,281
That will put the butts
in the seats.

510
00:29:08,816 --> 00:29:10,217
Hold on, Mickey.

511
00:29:16,924 --> 00:29:18,892
I don't wanna talk
to that Saperstein guy.

512
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:20,361
Already taken care of.

513
00:29:20,394 --> 00:29:21,395
Thanks, boss.

514
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:22,963
Go ahead, Mickey.

515
00:29:51,025 --> 00:29:53,060
That's it, fellas.
Steal the rhythm.

516
00:29:53,093 --> 00:29:54,928
Boom chick-a-boom
chick-a-boom.

517
00:30:03,137 --> 00:30:05,105
Yes!

518
00:30:11,045 --> 00:30:12,547
- Oh yeah!
- Alright! Hit it.

519
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,847
Show some magic.

520
00:30:21,288 --> 00:30:24,391
-Go ahead, Michael
-PLAYER 8: Go ahead, man!

521
00:30:24,425 --> 00:30:25,959
Now that's entertainment.

522
00:30:28,395 --> 00:30:30,565
Basketball as its finest.

523
00:30:38,372 --> 00:30:40,107
And skills.

524
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,241
Skills.

525
00:30:43,611 --> 00:30:45,412
Ringling brothers.

526
00:30:45,446 --> 00:30:47,281
Yeah, it comes in handy though.

527
00:30:47,314 --> 00:30:50,150
Believe me, and by the way,
people love it.

528
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:52,086
All that
and they can actually play.

529
00:30:53,053 --> 00:30:55,255
It's just a lot of fancy stuff.

530
00:30:55,289 --> 00:30:57,391
Yeah, but it sells,
you know it does.

531
00:31:04,298 --> 00:31:05,466
No, no, no, no, no, no.

532
00:31:05,499 --> 00:31:07,401
Don't just finger roll it in,

533
00:31:07,434 --> 00:31:08,536
around the back
or something,

534
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:09,571
and then stuff it.

535
00:31:09,604 --> 00:31:10,904
Razzle dazzle!

536
00:31:10,938 --> 00:31:11,939
Remember that!

537
00:31:11,972 --> 00:31:14,007
That's what the fans pay for.

538
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:16,977
Don't start playing white on,
you're gonna put them to sleep.

539
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:19,113
Five-minute break,
and I mean, five!

540
00:31:27,988 --> 00:31:31,091
Hey, you pay no mind to Sap.

541
00:31:32,326 --> 00:31:34,261
You go over there
and handle your business.

542
00:31:34,294 --> 00:31:35,929
You're gonna see,
he's a great kid.

543
00:31:36,997 --> 00:31:38,399
Just try not to scare him.

544
00:31:42,002 --> 00:31:43,605
I want you to meet Ned Irish.

545
00:31:43,638 --> 00:31:45,707
He owns the Knickerbockers,
and the Garden.

546
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,041
No fooling, huh?

547
00:31:48,075 --> 00:31:49,677
Nice to meet you, Mr. Irish.

548
00:31:49,711 --> 00:31:51,546
Great to meet you too, Nat.

549
00:31:51,579 --> 00:31:53,180
Hey, let me see those hands.

550
00:31:55,449 --> 00:31:56,618
Oh, wow.

551
00:31:58,152 --> 00:31:59,654
Well, welcome back
to the Garden.

552
00:31:59,687 --> 00:32:02,022
Uh, yes sir, thank you.

553
00:32:02,055 --> 00:32:04,626
No, what's with this sir stuff?
Call me "Ned".

554
00:32:04,659 --> 00:32:06,093
Sorry.

555
00:32:06,126 --> 00:32:08,962
Just a habit left over
from my days in the army.

556
00:32:08,996 --> 00:32:10,665
You fought in the war?

557
00:32:10,698 --> 00:32:12,232
Yes sir, Joe.

558
00:32:14,301 --> 00:32:16,203
- Here, have a seat.
- Have a seat.

559
00:32:18,205 --> 00:32:20,340
Saperstein's a little tough
on you, huh?

560
00:32:21,609 --> 00:32:23,076
He knows what he wants.

561
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:24,244
Yeah.

562
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:26,346
He wants a show,
that's what he wants.

563
00:32:27,649 --> 00:32:29,483
Abe's got to win all the time.

564
00:32:29,517 --> 00:32:31,586
That's what we get paid to do.

565
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:32,720
However, much that is.

566
00:32:32,754 --> 00:32:35,322
And I'm telling you,
it ain't much.

567
00:32:35,355 --> 00:32:39,993
So uh, you win all the time
and you get paid for it?

568
00:32:40,027 --> 00:32:43,030
Sounds like a champagne problem
to me.

569
00:32:43,063 --> 00:32:45,399
It ain't like that, Mr. Irish.

570
00:32:45,432 --> 00:32:49,671
You see, Abe sets up these
games with white players

571
00:32:49,704 --> 00:32:51,739
for us to win.

572
00:32:51,773 --> 00:32:53,775
What gets me is why set it up,

573
00:32:53,808 --> 00:32:55,710
when we're better
than all these white teams,

574
00:32:55,743 --> 00:32:57,411
that can beat 'em anyways.

575
00:32:58,378 --> 00:32:59,614
It's not like he's asking you

576
00:32:59,647 --> 00:33:01,583
to take a dive
in the 12th round.

577
00:33:03,116 --> 00:33:04,384
You see, Mr. Irish,

578
00:33:06,086 --> 00:33:08,088
we do things
with this basketball,

579
00:33:08,121 --> 00:33:10,457
don't even exist in your dreams.

580
00:33:12,292 --> 00:33:15,095
And I get people paying
for that.

581
00:33:15,128 --> 00:33:17,632
But I ain't interested
in being part of no circus.

582
00:33:17,665 --> 00:33:19,399
Okay, nap time's over.

583
00:33:19,433 --> 00:33:21,134
We got a big game tonight.

584
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:22,402
A bunch of college idiots

585
00:33:22,436 --> 00:33:23,705
who can't wait
to get their butts kicked.

586
00:33:23,738 --> 00:33:26,039
Let's go. Sweets!

587
00:33:46,728 --> 00:33:48,061
Yeah!

588
00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:49,263
Sweetwater!

589
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:52,266
Okay, Caleb and Andrew,

590
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:55,703
I want you guys out there
double-teaming Sweetwater.

591
00:33:55,737 --> 00:33:57,539
But every time we step
on this court,

592
00:33:57,572 --> 00:33:59,239
-it means something.
-Right.

593
00:33:59,273 --> 00:34:00,775
So, let's make these
last seconds count.

594
00:34:00,808 --> 00:34:02,309
-Mm-hmm.
-Hey.

595
00:34:03,343 --> 00:34:05,078
I got something up my sleeve.

596
00:34:10,284 --> 00:34:13,420
Wa-- wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

597
00:34:13,453 --> 00:34:14,522
Wait.

598
00:34:20,828 --> 00:34:23,096
Hehe. Thank you!

599
00:34:26,734 --> 00:34:28,168
It worked, man.

600
00:34:28,201 --> 00:34:29,169
Alright, man,
I'll tell you

601
00:34:29,202 --> 00:34:31,606
after a win like that,
I'm going out tonight.

602
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,575
Looking like Superman
with them shoulder pads on.

603
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:36,410
Where we going tonight?

604
00:34:36,443 --> 00:34:39,212
If you want to meet the fellows,
you just need to tell me.

605
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,550
Later.

606
00:34:42,584 --> 00:34:44,686
Okay fellas, grab your stuff.
Let's get on the bus.

607
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,420
- Here we go!
- Irish.

608
00:34:46,453 --> 00:34:47,655
Thank you, thank you, thank
you, thank you.

609
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:49,256
Good to see you there,
Mr. Irish.

610
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:50,324
Great game, great game.

611
00:34:50,357 --> 00:34:52,125
You make sure there's money
out there...

612
00:34:53,928 --> 00:34:55,362
It really is your lucky day.

613
00:34:55,395 --> 00:34:56,731
How lucky am I?

614
00:34:56,764 --> 00:34:58,666
About 2 grand lucky.

615
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,902
You're not so bad after all,
Irish.

616
00:35:00,935 --> 00:35:02,704
Wish I could say the same
about you, Abe.

617
00:35:03,871 --> 00:35:05,305
What about the other team?

618
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:06,741
Took care of them
from my end.

619
00:35:06,774 --> 00:35:07,842
Like we agreed.

620
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:09,811
- 100 shekels each?
- 100 a man.

621
00:35:09,844 --> 00:35:11,546
-Paid in full.
-Alright, I gotta skedaddle.

622
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:13,848
We got another show
upstate in the boonies.

623
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:15,415
Looks like you're working
too hard.

624
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:18,720
Oh, if I had your money,
I'd give mine away.

625
00:35:18,753 --> 00:35:19,821
Huh.

626
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:53,721
Special place, isn't it?

627
00:35:53,755 --> 00:35:55,123
Oh yeah.

628
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:57,725
She is beautiful.

629
00:35:57,759 --> 00:35:59,393
Yeah.

630
00:35:59,426 --> 00:36:01,796
I won a couple of championships
here with St John's.

631
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:03,731
-Oh, I know.
-Yeah.

632
00:36:03,765 --> 00:36:05,165
Yeah.

633
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:09,169
Let's see what you're made of.

634
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,941
Try to get one past me.

635
00:36:13,975 --> 00:36:15,610
You'll need to take that coat
off though.

636
00:36:16,978 --> 00:36:18,579
-You wanna play me?
-Yes, sir.

637
00:36:18,613 --> 00:36:21,415
Oh, come on. You serious?

638
00:36:21,448 --> 00:36:23,183
Yeah,
I couldn't be more serious.

639
00:36:24,786 --> 00:36:25,553
Alright.

640
00:36:27,522 --> 00:36:28,623
Come on,
I know what you're thinking.

641
00:36:28,656 --> 00:36:29,456
I know what you're thinking.

642
00:36:29,489 --> 00:36:32,225
That you're taller,
and stronger,

643
00:36:32,259 --> 00:36:33,795
and a better athlete.

644
00:36:33,828 --> 00:36:35,295
Better looking.

645
00:36:35,328 --> 00:36:37,999
Longer arm reach,
bigger hands.

646
00:36:38,032 --> 00:36:40,333
But you...

647
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:42,235
You cannot get one pass me.

648
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:43,470
Alright.

649
00:36:45,707 --> 00:36:47,942
-Hold on, Joe. Hold on.
-Oh, I think you're--

650
00:36:47,975 --> 00:36:49,677
-wait a minute.
-Now hold on, Joe.

651
00:36:49,711 --> 00:36:50,712
-That was a foul, Joe.
-No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no,

652
00:36:50,745 --> 00:36:51,579
-you're thinking it was?
-It's-- it's a foul, Joe.

653
00:36:51,612 --> 00:36:53,313
No, no, it was--
There was not a foul.

654
00:36:53,346 --> 00:36:56,450
-You did forget something.
-Okay. Okay.

655
00:36:56,483 --> 00:36:57,618
Okay.

656
00:36:57,652 --> 00:36:59,954
-Oh, now the coat comes off.
-Alright.

657
00:36:59,987 --> 00:37:01,288
Give me the ball.

658
00:37:02,023 --> 00:37:03,958
Okay.

659
00:37:03,991 --> 00:37:05,727
Too much Godzilla,
come on, Joe.

660
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,494
-Oh!
-Come on, Joe.

661
00:37:08,996 --> 00:37:10,732
No, no, no.

662
00:37:10,765 --> 00:37:12,466
That uh...

663
00:37:12,499 --> 00:37:14,334
It happens every once
in a while.

664
00:37:14,367 --> 00:37:15,268
-Come on, Coach.
-You know what?

665
00:37:15,302 --> 00:37:16,904
I wasn't warmed up kid.

666
00:37:16,938 --> 00:37:17,972
I warm up,
that doesn't happen.

667
00:37:19,339 --> 00:37:21,042
Okay. You're gonna walk away?

668
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:22,275
- That's it.
- It's okay.

669
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:23,811
You're scared, I get it.

670
00:37:23,845 --> 00:37:26,614
Oh, no, I think, you just need a
little more practice.

671
00:37:26,647 --> 00:37:27,782
Joe, Joe, Joe.

672
00:37:53,473 --> 00:37:55,375
Old clutch finally gave out.

673
00:37:56,711 --> 00:37:58,411
I'll get a mechanic
by the morning.

674
00:37:58,445 --> 00:38:00,280
But we ain't going anywhere
tonight.

675
00:38:03,551 --> 00:38:04,552
Night.

676
00:38:07,522 --> 00:38:08,823
What took you so long, Sweets?

677
00:38:08,856 --> 00:38:10,625
A lot of miles you
and me, huh?

678
00:38:11,692 --> 00:38:13,426
I'm going for a walk...

679
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,530
I mean, I can't really
complain, can I?

680
00:38:18,498 --> 00:38:19,834
Where the hell are you going?

681
00:38:19,867 --> 00:38:21,836
Oh, mind your business, Abe.

682
00:38:31,646 --> 00:38:33,681
Kitchen's closed.

683
00:38:33,714 --> 00:38:34,916
You need to leave.

684
00:38:37,852 --> 00:38:40,588
I said, you need to leave.

685
00:38:41,722 --> 00:38:43,024
It's okay.

686
00:38:43,057 --> 00:38:44,424
He's with me.

687
00:38:46,627 --> 00:38:48,461
Okay, come on.

688
00:38:57,805 --> 00:38:59,106
- Good evening, sir.
- What can I get for you?

689
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:02,109
Yeah, uh, another Bourbon
for me

690
00:39:02,143 --> 00:39:04,712
and uh,
make it a double for my friend.

691
00:39:04,745 --> 00:39:06,881
A glass of water
and two scoops of sugar, please.

692
00:39:28,669 --> 00:39:29,737
She ain't bad.

693
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:32,707
The way she bend them notes,
catches you off guard,

694
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,708
you know.

695
00:39:33,741 --> 00:39:35,142
Like shooting the ball
when you ain't thinking.

696
00:39:35,176 --> 00:39:36,978
Hm. And how you play.

697
00:39:37,011 --> 00:39:39,180
Yeah, man, yeah.

698
00:39:39,213 --> 00:39:41,148
Like jazz.

699
00:39:41,182 --> 00:39:42,116
Feeling.

700
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:43,885
I'll have to pay more attention
next time.

701
00:39:44,986 --> 00:39:47,487
You know, uh,
Lapchick's preaches

702
00:39:47,521 --> 00:39:48,856
that you're the future
of basketball.

703
00:39:50,758 --> 00:39:53,094
Oh, right now, my future is
on a broken down bus

704
00:39:53,127 --> 00:39:55,162
in a alley.

705
00:39:55,196 --> 00:39:57,464
You know, we could change that.

706
00:39:57,497 --> 00:39:58,532
I know if you pay me right,

707
00:39:58,566 --> 00:40:00,433
maybe we could win
a championship.

708
00:40:01,202 --> 00:40:02,637
I'd pay anything
to see the look

709
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,572
on Abe's face, if you left.

710
00:40:07,474 --> 00:40:09,810
Nothing more tempting
than freedom.

711
00:40:09,844 --> 00:40:10,845
Well, let's see now.

712
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:17,919
How's that?

713
00:40:17,952 --> 00:40:19,820
Thanks for the soda pop.

714
00:40:19,854 --> 00:40:20,988
It's the least I could do.

715
00:40:22,223 --> 00:40:23,490
Enjoy your sweet water,
Sweetwater.

716
00:40:58,659 --> 00:41:03,564
Ah, sorry to bother you miss,

717
00:41:03,597 --> 00:41:06,499
I really enjoyed your singing
just now.

718
00:41:06,534 --> 00:41:07,969
Especially that last Blues.

719
00:41:09,003 --> 00:41:09,971
Thanks.

720
00:41:13,107 --> 00:41:14,474
Hey.

721
00:41:23,284 --> 00:41:24,752
Jeanne Staples.

722
00:41:24,785 --> 00:41:26,120
Nat Clifton.

723
00:41:26,153 --> 00:41:27,755
Some call me "Sweetwater".

724
00:41:28,689 --> 00:41:30,925
You've got a nice soulful voice.

725
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:35,663
I could listen to you
singing them Blues all night.

726
00:41:35,696 --> 00:41:37,631
Oh, I love the Blues,
you know.

727
00:41:38,866 --> 00:41:43,604
Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith,
Billie Holliday,

728
00:41:44,805 --> 00:41:46,607
that's real.

729
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,776
Say, there's a cool after hours
joint up in Harlem.

730
00:41:49,844 --> 00:41:51,278
Doesn't really get cooking
till late.

731
00:41:51,312 --> 00:41:52,947
Ah...

732
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,016
I don't know if that might be,
you know...

733
00:41:55,049 --> 00:41:56,650
No such thing as too late.

734
00:41:57,885 --> 00:41:58,919
Okay.

735
00:42:29,116 --> 00:42:30,951
Is that T-Bone?

736
00:42:57,311 --> 00:43:00,247
Hold on, hold on, hold on,
hold on, guys.

737
00:43:00,281 --> 00:43:01,649
I seen somebody just walk
in here

738
00:43:01,682 --> 00:43:03,117
and light up the whole room.

739
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:07,121
A good friend,
goes by the name of Sweetwater.

740
00:44:22,796 --> 00:44:23,964
Alright, ladies and gentlemen,

741
00:44:23,998 --> 00:44:25,966
y'all give it up
for this lovely young lady,

742
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,801
singing the blues
for you tonight,

743
00:44:27,835 --> 00:44:29,170
Miss Jeanne Staples.

744
00:44:35,242 --> 00:44:36,777
You guys are jumping hot
tonight.

745
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:39,079
Oh well, thank you,
but look who's talking?

746
00:44:39,113 --> 00:44:42,082
Yeah, Jeanne gigs over
at the 50 Second Club.

747
00:44:42,116 --> 00:44:43,450
-Is that right?
-Mm-hmm.

748
00:44:43,484 --> 00:44:45,386
Alright, well next time,
we're in town,

749
00:44:45,419 --> 00:44:47,121
we got to have you
come sing with us again.

750
00:44:47,154 --> 00:44:48,189
Oh, I'd like that very much.

751
00:44:48,222 --> 00:44:49,390
Thank you, sir.

752
00:44:49,423 --> 00:44:50,958
It's just T-Bone.

753
00:44:53,961 --> 00:44:55,062
Alright.

754
00:45:24,024 --> 00:45:26,961
I can't with how many times
I've had to fix this damn thing.

755
00:45:28,028 --> 00:45:30,532
You know-- hey Sweets,
we're almost done here.

756
00:45:30,565 --> 00:45:32,733
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

757
00:45:33,901 --> 00:45:35,436
Oh, I'm gonna go wash up.

758
00:45:35,469 --> 00:45:36,370
Alright, hurry up.

759
00:45:36,403 --> 00:45:38,439
We gotta get upstate.

760
00:45:38,472 --> 00:45:39,873
How much is this gonna be?

761
00:45:39,907 --> 00:45:42,176
$5? $10? You know what?

762
00:45:42,209 --> 00:45:44,078
Don't answer that.
It's a trick question.

763
00:46:01,428 --> 00:46:02,530
Alright, half court offence.

764
00:46:02,564 --> 00:46:04,331
Here we go, boys. Here we go.

765
00:46:04,365 --> 00:46:05,899
Here we go, okay.

766
00:46:05,933 --> 00:46:07,535
McGuire, what are you doing?

767
00:46:07,569 --> 00:46:08,802
Okay, keep it moving.

768
00:46:08,836 --> 00:46:11,038
Extra pass. Extra pass.

769
00:46:12,339 --> 00:46:14,041
What are you--
Hold on a second.

770
00:46:14,074 --> 00:46:16,076
If we keep coming
without the ball,

771
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:18,145
let's go again, alright.
Give and go.

772
00:46:18,178 --> 00:46:20,414
As soon as you give it,
just make that cut.

773
00:46:20,447 --> 00:46:21,882
Make-- Don't ever stop.

774
00:46:21,915 --> 00:46:23,183
- Okay.
- This doesn't stop.

775
00:46:23,217 --> 00:46:24,285
Let's go, let's go.

776
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:25,553
Movement.

777
00:46:25,587 --> 00:46:28,155
Make that cut. There we go.

778
00:46:28,188 --> 00:46:30,024
Okay. Perfect.

779
00:46:30,057 --> 00:46:30,924
Alright?

780
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:32,092
That's how it's done.

781
00:46:32,126 --> 00:46:34,428
There's more options
from the post.

782
00:46:34,461 --> 00:46:36,063
-Who's that?
-Oh, look at that.

783
00:46:37,331 --> 00:46:38,600
Good to see you, Joe.

784
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:42,169
You too, Sweetwater.

785
00:46:42,202 --> 00:46:43,203
Give me the ball.

786
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:47,509
Alright, fellas, same play.

787
00:46:47,542 --> 00:46:49,410
Set it up.

788
00:46:49,443 --> 00:46:52,313
Max, Vandeweghe,
criss cross right there.

789
00:46:52,346 --> 00:46:53,847
McGuire, cut now!

790
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:56,518
-Hey. Yeah!

791
00:46:57,451 --> 00:46:58,586
Nice layout!

792
00:46:58,620 --> 00:46:59,853
Nice shot.

793
00:46:59,887 --> 00:47:02,356
Not bad for a bunch
of white guys.

794
00:47:02,389 --> 00:47:03,490
Now, that's a well-coached team.

795
00:47:03,525 --> 00:47:04,158
Hmm.

796
00:47:05,426 --> 00:47:07,027
- That's a well.
- Thanks for this one, fellas.

797
00:47:07,061 --> 00:47:09,229
-Absolutely.
-See you around, Joe.

798
00:47:11,965 --> 00:47:13,568
Hey Joe, can I have a word,
please?

799
00:47:13,601 --> 00:47:14,968
Alright, guys, come on.

800
00:47:15,002 --> 00:47:16,370
Give me a second, guys.

801
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,643
Um, what do you think
you're doing?

802
00:47:21,676 --> 00:47:22,943
What are you talking about?

803
00:47:22,976 --> 00:47:25,647
You do realize letting him play
is a violation of league policy?

804
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,981
No. League policy says that you
can't

805
00:47:28,015 --> 00:47:30,150
draft a player of color.

806
00:47:30,184 --> 00:47:31,352
It doesn't say that you
can't practice.

807
00:47:31,385 --> 00:47:33,120
Oh, come on, Joe.

808
00:47:34,988 --> 00:47:36,524
No one moves like Sweetwater.

809
00:47:36,558 --> 00:47:37,891
No one, no one posts up
like him.

810
00:47:37,925 --> 00:47:39,026
No one can pass.

811
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:40,928
Maybe Cousy, but he's not 6'8".

812
00:47:40,961 --> 00:47:43,230
Sweetwater is an older player.

813
00:47:43,263 --> 00:47:45,633
And more importantly,
you're forgetting that he's a...

814
00:47:45,667 --> 00:47:47,034
A negro?

815
00:47:49,537 --> 00:47:51,004
We could win a title
with that negro.

816
00:47:51,972 --> 00:47:54,041
He'd make a great Knickerbocker.

817
00:47:54,074 --> 00:47:55,376
That's just my two cents.

818
00:47:57,612 --> 00:47:59,079
Thank you.

819
00:48:03,551 --> 00:48:05,285
Alright, guys.

820
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:06,387
Let's hit the shower.

821
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,622
Good work today.

822
00:48:07,655 --> 00:48:09,089
Let's go, fellows.

823
00:48:18,065 --> 00:48:20,367
Look, I know that the league

824
00:48:20,401 --> 00:48:23,404
and the owners are gonna fight
you on this to no end--

825
00:48:23,437 --> 00:48:25,406
-Huh.
-But I want this.

826
00:48:25,439 --> 00:48:27,207
I want it bad, Ned. Alright?

827
00:48:27,241 --> 00:48:30,545
You saw it was sellout crowd,
right?

828
00:48:30,578 --> 00:48:32,680
The fans are gonna
eat it up.

829
00:48:32,714 --> 00:48:34,314
Yeah, well, have you ever
thought of the fact

830
00:48:34,348 --> 00:48:36,316
that maybe Sweetwater's best
years might be behind him?

831
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:37,351
Oh, come on, that's--

832
00:48:37,384 --> 00:48:38,986
You know that's not true.

833
00:48:39,019 --> 00:48:41,255
We all know that's not true.

834
00:48:41,288 --> 00:48:45,225
Look, Sweetwater knows this game
better than anyone,

835
00:48:45,259 --> 00:48:47,227
young or old.

836
00:48:47,261 --> 00:48:49,163
You know how long,

837
00:48:49,196 --> 00:48:53,333
and how hard I have fought
to break down barriers?

838
00:48:54,468 --> 00:48:56,103
I will fight for this.

839
00:48:57,037 --> 00:48:58,939
I wanna fight with you.

840
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:04,111
It's not an easy mountain
to climb, Joe.

841
00:49:04,144 --> 00:49:05,479
Yeah, we'll climb it together.

842
00:49:08,348 --> 00:49:09,450
Could get ugly.

843
00:49:09,483 --> 00:49:10,552
I was born ugly.

844
00:49:14,087 --> 00:49:15,322
- Thanks very much.
- You're welcome.

845
00:49:15,355 --> 00:49:17,224
- Take care of yourself.
- Thank you.

846
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:22,362
Hey, Saperstein.

847
00:49:22,396 --> 00:49:23,698
Great game yesterday.

848
00:49:23,731 --> 00:49:25,600
About that,

849
00:49:25,633 --> 00:49:26,601
listen I'm glad I saw you.

850
00:49:26,634 --> 00:49:28,536
I wanted to thank you
for the accommodations

851
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:32,005
your urine-soaked alleyway
has been very nice to me.

852
00:49:32,039 --> 00:49:34,208
You're welcome, anytime.

853
00:49:34,241 --> 00:49:38,546
So uh,
I think this belongs to you.

854
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:41,248
What?
We settled up last night.

855
00:49:41,281 --> 00:49:42,617
New day new deal.

856
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:44,418
Yeah, but what is it?

857
00:49:44,451 --> 00:49:46,420
It's about 5,000 in cash.

858
00:49:46,453 --> 00:49:47,488
What?

859
00:49:47,522 --> 00:49:48,489
Why?

860
00:49:48,523 --> 00:49:50,123
Why?

861
00:49:50,157 --> 00:49:52,392
Well, it's not a raise.

862
00:49:52,426 --> 00:49:54,361
I want
to buy Sweetwater's contract.

863
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:59,501
I like you, Irish.

864
00:49:59,534 --> 00:50:00,502
You're funny.

865
00:50:02,135 --> 00:50:03,671
Did you talk to Sweets
about this?

866
00:50:03,705 --> 00:50:06,073
-Not really, no.
-No, didn't think so.

867
00:50:06,106 --> 00:50:08,610
I should keep this cash
to pay for the insult.

868
00:50:08,643 --> 00:50:09,878
-It's not happening.
-Why?

869
00:50:09,911 --> 00:50:12,747
I thought you'd be interested
in getting rid of a headache.

870
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:14,414
Yeah, it's quite the headache
I get

871
00:50:14,448 --> 00:50:16,618
from counting all the money
he makes me.

872
00:50:16,651 --> 00:50:17,619
Forget it.

873
00:50:18,853 --> 00:50:20,420
Let me ask you something.
You don't really think

874
00:50:20,454 --> 00:50:22,256
Sweetwater's gonna play
in the NBA?

875
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:23,791
Lapchick, I understand,
he wants to move the

876
00:50:23,825 --> 00:50:25,560
color line and I respect that,

877
00:50:25,593 --> 00:50:27,529
but what is your angle?

878
00:50:27,562 --> 00:50:28,563
I don't know.

879
00:50:29,697 --> 00:50:32,600
Fill the Garden, win a couple of
championships, maybe.

880
00:50:32,634 --> 00:50:34,134
-For the glory?
-For the glory.

881
00:50:34,167 --> 00:50:36,136
-Why not?
-Okay.

882
00:50:36,169 --> 00:50:38,338
I just don't see you
spending a dime

883
00:50:38,372 --> 00:50:39,339
on a negro player,

884
00:50:39,373 --> 00:50:42,777
when you know the league
will never let him play.

885
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:45,178
'Cause of the rules.

886
00:50:45,212 --> 00:50:47,047
I like breaking the rules.

887
00:50:48,716 --> 00:50:50,585
You did pretty good
with no Jew,

888
00:50:50,618 --> 00:50:52,252
especially one
with five negros,

889
00:50:52,286 --> 00:50:54,354
will ever play in the Garden.

890
00:50:54,388 --> 00:50:56,858
-Did I say that?
-That's a quote.

891
00:50:56,891 --> 00:50:57,859
-Oh.
-This is not happening

892
00:50:57,892 --> 00:51:00,160
-in your lifetime.
-Okay.

893
00:51:00,193 --> 00:51:01,829
I mean, I can't change your
mind at all.

894
00:51:01,863 --> 00:51:03,831
I mean, think about it,

895
00:51:03,865 --> 00:51:05,833
you get to sleep
in a real bed,

896
00:51:05,867 --> 00:51:08,536
with real sheets,
not on the floor of a bus.

897
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:10,437
Come on!

898
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:12,172
-Sheets?
-Sheets.

899
00:51:12,205 --> 00:51:13,373
What kind of sheets?

900
00:51:13,407 --> 00:51:15,208
Egyptian cotton,
you're gonna love it.

901
00:51:15,242 --> 00:51:16,511
You son of a bitch.

902
00:51:17,879 --> 00:51:19,379
-Get out of here.
-Ah, you're a f--

903
00:51:19,413 --> 00:51:21,448
You're the funny one,
Saperstein.

904
00:51:21,481 --> 00:51:23,651
You know I like you,
you know that?

905
00:51:23,685 --> 00:51:25,853
Why don't you call me, when you
get back from the boondocks?

906
00:51:25,887 --> 00:51:27,354
-Okay?
-It's not enough.

907
00:51:27,387 --> 00:51:28,455
Okay.

908
00:52:11,633 --> 00:52:14,869
Okay. You guys are looking good
with the matching uniforms,

909
00:52:14,902 --> 00:52:16,537
and fancy shoes.

910
00:52:16,571 --> 00:52:18,506
Alright.

911
00:52:18,539 --> 00:52:19,641
Here we are, Ref.

912
00:52:19,674 --> 00:52:21,909
Alright. Count it, boys.

913
00:52:21,943 --> 00:52:24,646
Should be 75 shekels a piece
in there for you.

914
00:52:24,679 --> 00:52:26,246
I counted it myself,
now,

915
00:52:26,279 --> 00:52:28,482
let's go over the game plan,
shall we?

916
00:52:28,516 --> 00:52:30,618
You play along with the
shenanigans on the court.

917
00:52:30,652 --> 00:52:33,320
The Trotters win, and everything
works out for everybody.

918
00:52:33,353 --> 00:52:34,856
Easy, right?
Any questions?

919
00:52:34,889 --> 00:52:36,323
No? Great!

920
00:52:36,356 --> 00:52:38,325
-Alright!
-Mr. Saperstein?

921
00:52:38,358 --> 00:52:39,627
-Yeah!
-I just want to say

922
00:52:39,661 --> 00:52:41,194
this is so generous.

923
00:52:41,228 --> 00:52:42,329
Right, right, yeah, yeah.

924
00:52:42,362 --> 00:52:43,598
Let's not count it out here.

925
00:52:43,631 --> 00:52:44,832
It's Saperstein, yeah.

926
00:52:44,866 --> 00:52:45,933
Okay.

927
00:52:45,967 --> 00:52:47,434
Sweet!

928
00:52:48,836 --> 00:52:49,937
What are you doing, pal?

929
00:52:49,971 --> 00:52:52,305
Come on, we got a game
in five minutes.

930
00:52:56,476 --> 00:52:57,812
You ready?

931
00:52:57,845 --> 00:52:59,614
What's the matter?

932
00:52:59,647 --> 00:53:01,582
Oh, buddy, come on,
we're gonna have some fun.

933
00:53:02,784 --> 00:53:05,252
Boom chick-a-boom.
Here we go.

934
00:53:07,387 --> 00:53:08,690
Alright, alright,
you got him.

935
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:10,591
Here we go.

936
00:53:11,759 --> 00:53:12,860
Yeah!

937
00:53:12,894 --> 00:53:13,961
Alright, alright.

938
00:53:13,995 --> 00:53:15,295
Hey!!

939
00:53:15,328 --> 00:53:16,931
Okay, okay, I got it, I got it.
Hey!

940
00:53:16,964 --> 00:53:17,932
Between your legs!

941
00:53:20,868 --> 00:53:22,737
Over your head, ah!

942
00:53:25,472 --> 00:53:27,340
Watch it, watch it, watch it,
watch it!

943
00:53:29,911 --> 00:53:31,813
Yeah!

944
00:53:33,981 --> 00:53:35,616
Just wait a minute.

945
00:53:37,284 --> 00:53:40,822
Who believes in magic?

946
00:53:41,656 --> 00:53:42,389
I do! I do! Me!

947
00:53:42,422 --> 00:53:43,691
What is this?
What's happening?

948
00:53:43,725 --> 00:53:44,792
Hey Sap!

949
00:53:44,826 --> 00:53:46,594
Just sit back
and enjoy the magic.

950
00:53:46,627 --> 00:53:47,662
Right.

951
00:53:47,695 --> 00:53:49,496
Oh, I think I see somebody.

952
00:53:50,965 --> 00:53:52,299
Excuse me.

953
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,368
- Come.
- Oh, now, wait second.

954
00:53:56,971 --> 00:53:58,271
Just go with it.

955
00:53:59,507 --> 00:54:02,275
Come on,
now, you show me the magic.

956
00:54:02,309 --> 00:54:06,013
All you gotta do is believe.

957
00:54:10,718 --> 00:54:12,920
Do I gotta pay the kid now?

958
00:54:12,954 --> 00:54:14,287
Didn't that feel good?

959
00:54:14,321 --> 00:54:15,857
That felt great.

960
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:19,761
Alright, let's wrap it up.

961
00:54:19,794 --> 00:54:21,529
Hold on, fellas!

962
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:24,532
What's the score?

963
00:54:26,534 --> 00:54:30,605
Hey man, it's a little bit
to a lot.

964
00:54:30,638 --> 00:54:32,840
Well, let's make it a little
bit more funny.

965
00:54:32,874 --> 00:54:34,709
What you talking about, Sweet?

966
00:54:34,742 --> 00:54:35,710
Follow me.

967
00:54:42,016 --> 00:54:43,918
You're scoring on the other
team's basket.

968
00:54:43,951 --> 00:54:45,586
I'm gonna count on it.

969
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:47,487
I'm gonna count--
That's for you guys.

970
00:54:47,522 --> 00:54:49,389
Yes.
They just made you get this.

971
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:52,794
These are all counting.

972
00:54:52,827 --> 00:54:55,096
Keep it going, keep it going,
keep it going.

973
00:54:55,129 --> 00:54:56,396
Okay, that's 60!

974
00:55:02,837 --> 00:55:04,005
That's enough.

975
00:55:08,441 --> 00:55:10,812
- Now hold on now.
- Goose!

976
00:55:10,845 --> 00:55:12,547
It's tied up.

977
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:13,413
Whoa!

978
00:55:13,446 --> 00:55:16,584
And we only have three seconds
left.

979
00:55:16,617 --> 00:55:17,718
Everybody!

980
00:55:17,752 --> 00:55:21,055
3, 2, 1.

981
00:55:21,088 --> 00:55:22,455
You better make that.

982
00:55:31,165 --> 00:55:32,533
And a regulation,

983
00:55:32,567 --> 00:55:35,335
that shot counts,
Harlem wins by 2.

984
00:55:36,003 --> 00:55:37,572
Yeah, thanks.

985
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:39,339
Wow.

986
00:55:39,372 --> 00:55:41,576
Oh, absolutely.

987
00:55:43,611 --> 00:55:45,780
Sweetwater, what the hell
was that about?

988
00:55:45,813 --> 00:55:47,148
Well, that's entertainment.

989
00:55:47,181 --> 00:55:48,749
That's what you pay me to do.

990
00:55:48,783 --> 00:55:50,918
No, I pay you to stick
to my game plan.

991
00:55:52,653 --> 00:55:54,387
We won.

992
00:55:54,421 --> 00:55:55,756
Just like you planned.

993
00:55:57,058 --> 00:55:58,526
Scoring baskets
for the other team

994
00:55:58,559 --> 00:55:59,961
was never part of my plan.

995
00:55:59,994 --> 00:56:01,863
It never will be.

996
00:56:01,896 --> 00:56:03,698
Okay, Abe.

997
00:56:03,731 --> 00:56:05,933
But I heard you say something
about some shenanigans.

998
00:56:07,768 --> 00:56:08,970
Yeah.

999
00:56:11,105 --> 00:56:13,007
On the bus now!

1000
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,642
Let's go! Let's go!

1001
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:17,812
-Thanks, everybody.
-Yeah. We gotta go.

1002
00:56:17,845 --> 00:56:19,747
Bus leaves in five minutes with
or without you,

1003
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:21,949
and I mean five.
Let's go, let's go.

1004
00:56:23,184 --> 00:56:24,318
-Thanks, folks.
-What's your name?

1005
00:56:24,352 --> 00:56:28,689
Hey, that bit with the kid,
now that is entertainment.

1006
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:31,424
Special, Sweets.

1007
00:56:31,458 --> 00:56:32,627
Keep doing your thing.

1008
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:33,828
Hmm.

1009
00:56:35,462 --> 00:56:37,497
-Thank you, Pop.
-Yeah.

1010
00:56:37,531 --> 00:56:38,666
Thank you, ma'am.

1011
00:56:39,734 --> 00:56:40,801
I love the hat.

1012
00:56:42,603 --> 00:56:44,572
- What a finish.
- Yes.

1013
00:56:44,605 --> 00:56:46,040
You signed them autographs,
Goose?

1014
00:56:46,073 --> 00:56:48,576
Thanks, man.

1015
00:56:48,609 --> 00:56:50,011
Pretty good game.

1016
00:56:50,044 --> 00:56:51,045
Yeah, thank you.

1017
00:56:51,078 --> 00:56:53,047
Great game indeed.

1018
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,115
-Fantastic.
-Thanks Abe.

1019
00:56:55,516 --> 00:56:57,484
Great job. Fantastic.

1020
00:56:57,518 --> 00:56:58,719
Fans loved that.

1021
00:56:58,753 --> 00:57:01,055
- Wonderful.
- It's great.

1022
00:57:01,088 --> 00:57:02,657
Yeah, I see that right.

1023
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:15,569
Say Marcus,
how much you got?

1024
00:57:16,771 --> 00:57:19,040
-Hm?
-50.

1025
00:57:19,073 --> 00:57:21,709
Goose, you?

1026
00:57:21,742 --> 00:57:23,144
50.

1027
00:57:23,177 --> 00:57:24,779
Pop?

1028
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:27,248
Oh, I see what's going on.

1029
00:57:27,281 --> 00:57:28,950
Come on now, how much you got?

1030
00:57:32,086 --> 00:57:34,588
That'll be 50.

1031
00:57:34,622 --> 00:57:35,856
50!

1032
00:57:36,991 --> 00:57:39,026
Yeah, me too.

1033
00:57:41,529 --> 00:57:44,832
Tell the boys how much you pay
the other team, Abe.

1034
00:57:44,865 --> 00:57:46,968
Hm.

1035
00:57:47,001 --> 00:57:48,468
Is there a problem?

1036
00:57:49,904 --> 00:57:52,239
We whipped their butts!

1037
00:57:52,273 --> 00:57:54,141
And they get paid more
than we do.

1038
00:57:55,009 --> 00:57:57,078
Now that sound right.

1039
00:57:57,111 --> 00:57:58,212
Does it, fellas?

1040
00:57:58,245 --> 00:57:59,580
No, no.

1041
00:57:59,613 --> 00:58:02,917
Them white boys get paid more
to lose,

1042
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:05,553
than we get paid to win.

1043
00:58:05,586 --> 00:58:08,889
I mean I don't know,
maybe I should switch teams.

1044
00:58:08,923 --> 00:58:09,790
- No.
- Come on.

1045
00:58:09,824 --> 00:58:12,026
Make a little extra cabbage
next time.

1046
00:58:13,928 --> 00:58:15,696
Big question is,

1047
00:58:16,764 --> 00:58:19,567
how much are you making, Abe?

1048
00:58:28,876 --> 00:58:31,579
Oh, you were but a babe,
when I created this team.

1049
00:58:33,214 --> 00:58:35,983
Hell, when I turned
the Savoy Big Five

1050
00:58:36,017 --> 00:58:40,287
into the Harlem Globetrotters,
you were just starting to walk.

1051
00:58:40,321 --> 00:58:41,922
I created this team.

1052
00:58:41,956 --> 00:58:43,557
I named this team.

1053
00:58:43,591 --> 00:58:46,794
I sowed the costumes
you're wearing.

1054
00:58:47,762 --> 00:58:50,664
Most importantly,
I'm your boss.

1055
00:58:52,333 --> 00:58:54,835
I'm the reason this team exists!

1056
00:58:54,869 --> 00:58:59,573
I'm the reason
it's such a success.

1057
00:58:59,607 --> 00:59:00,975
Why do I do this everyday?

1058
00:59:02,043 --> 00:59:03,310
For you!

1059
00:59:03,344 --> 00:59:05,913
I do whatever it takes
to get your next meet.

1060
00:59:05,946 --> 00:59:08,049
To get you the recognition
for what you do better

1061
00:59:08,082 --> 00:59:11,986
than any other human being
on this planet,

1062
00:59:12,019 --> 00:59:13,721
which is play basketball.

1063
00:59:15,089 --> 00:59:17,224
There's nobody better.

1064
00:59:17,258 --> 00:59:20,694
So just,
stick to playing basketball.

1065
00:59:21,629 --> 00:59:23,564
That's what you do.

1066
00:59:25,966 --> 00:59:27,835
This ain't about basketball,
Abe.

1067
00:59:28,903 --> 00:59:30,771
We're just part of your circus,
man.

1068
00:59:31,972 --> 00:59:32,640
I mean you say,

1069
00:59:32,673 --> 00:59:35,743
nobody does it better than us.

1070
00:59:35,776 --> 00:59:38,045
We beat the world champs, man.

1071
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,216
We feel we can beat any team
anywhere,

1072
00:59:42,249 --> 00:59:43,984
fair and square.

1073
00:59:45,152 --> 00:59:46,821
Listen, Abe,
all we's saying is,

1074
00:59:46,854 --> 00:59:49,223
you can pay the other team.

1075
00:59:49,256 --> 00:59:50,991
but don't you pay 'em to lose?

1076
00:59:52,193 --> 00:59:56,330
That take away all the fun
out of whipping their butts!

1077
00:59:56,363 --> 00:59:58,599
-That's right.
-Yes! Right, yeah.

1078
01:00:01,102 --> 01:00:02,203
Okay.

1079
01:00:04,305 --> 01:00:05,806
Fine.

1080
01:00:07,174 --> 01:00:09,009
You need me to remind you

1081
01:00:09,043 --> 01:00:11,345
what I thought everyone
in this bus,

1082
01:00:11,378 --> 01:00:13,848
thoroughly understood.

1083
01:00:13,881 --> 01:00:17,151
As a negro, you will not play
professional basketball,

1084
01:00:17,184 --> 01:00:18,853
unless you play for me.

1085
01:00:19,854 --> 01:00:22,723
This is my team.
I don't care who you are.

1086
01:00:22,756 --> 01:00:26,894
Nobody, especially you,
is gonna tell me how to run it!

1087
01:00:30,464 --> 01:00:32,800
I got big plans for you, fellas.

1088
01:00:44,211 --> 01:00:45,212
A barn?

1089
01:00:46,247 --> 01:00:48,182
Wow.

1090
01:00:48,215 --> 01:00:49,817
What now?

1091
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:52,319
It's nice to see you too, Abe.

1092
01:00:52,353 --> 01:00:55,122
Come on,
someone wants to say hi to you.

1093
01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:05,099
Well, I can't imagine

1094
01:01:05,132 --> 01:01:07,935
what brought you two city folks
all the way out here

1095
01:01:07,968 --> 01:01:09,136
to the boondocks.

1096
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:10,137
Abe.

1097
01:01:11,338 --> 01:01:13,874
You're wasting your time
and mine.

1098
01:01:13,908 --> 01:01:16,177
You know, it beats the hell out
of me,

1099
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:17,778
what got into you,

1100
01:01:17,811 --> 01:01:21,115
putting together a group
of negro basketball players.

1101
01:01:21,148 --> 01:01:24,318
From Timbuktu Illinois,
you got the whole world,

1102
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,953
thinking you guys are
from Harlem.

1103
01:01:27,021 --> 01:01:29,790
And now you're the best team
on the planet.

1104
01:01:29,823 --> 01:01:31,992
Greatest thing that ever
happened to basketball.

1105
01:01:34,128 --> 01:01:37,097
I recognize the brilliance
in you, Abe.

1106
01:01:37,131 --> 01:01:39,066
We're here to finish what
you started.

1107
01:01:39,099 --> 01:01:42,469
A negro basketball player
will walk on to an NBA court,

1108
01:01:42,504 --> 01:01:44,738
so help me God.

1109
01:01:44,772 --> 01:01:46,340
What do you think about that,
Irish?

1110
01:01:46,373 --> 01:01:48,209
You think that's gonna happen?

1111
01:01:48,242 --> 01:01:50,077
Don't be a sap, Saperstein.

1112
01:01:51,478 --> 01:01:53,080
How much does it ring?

1113
01:01:53,113 --> 01:01:54,315
Huh.

1114
01:01:54,348 --> 01:01:55,983
I'm starting to like this guy
more than I thought I would.

1115
01:02:01,121 --> 01:02:04,892
In this envelope,
is my final offer.

1116
01:02:04,925 --> 01:02:06,961
10,000 sheckles
as you call it.

1117
01:02:06,994 --> 01:02:09,463
Now, that's more money
than anyone will pay

1118
01:02:09,496 --> 01:02:10,998
for a negro player.

1119
01:02:12,266 --> 01:02:13,901
And I'm certain,

1120
01:02:13,934 --> 01:02:16,870
that you'll make sure,
Sweets gets some of it.

1121
01:02:31,185 --> 01:02:33,354
Don't even think about it,
that's my car.

1122
01:02:34,556 --> 01:02:36,757
You're never getting my car,
Abe.

1123
01:02:40,562 --> 01:02:42,029
What do they call that?

1124
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:44,164
What?

1125
01:02:44,198 --> 01:02:47,268
When someone comes into an
unexpected good fortune.

1126
01:02:48,402 --> 01:02:49,370
Luck of the Irish?

1127
01:02:49,403 --> 01:02:51,038
That's it!

1128
01:02:51,071 --> 01:02:53,240
Irish, today's your lucky day.

1129
01:02:54,576 --> 01:02:56,877
I'm gonna take your $10,000.

1130
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:00,414
You're gonna take Sweetwater
back with you

1131
01:03:00,447 --> 01:03:03,284
in that beautiful jalopy.

1132
01:03:03,317 --> 01:03:04,885
But when you get there,

1133
01:03:04,918 --> 01:03:07,921
you're gonna find
another 2500 in cash,

1134
01:03:08,922 --> 01:03:10,891
that you'll give to Sweetwater,

1135
01:03:10,924 --> 01:03:12,126
so he can get on his feet,
while he waits

1136
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:15,296
for his big Knickerbocker
salary to kick in.

1137
01:03:15,329 --> 01:03:17,097
That's my final offer.

1138
01:03:22,403 --> 01:03:24,071
Okay.

1139
01:03:24,104 --> 01:03:25,973
You're all out of excuses, Abe.

1140
01:03:29,109 --> 01:03:30,411
How about that?

1141
01:03:34,214 --> 01:03:36,283
How about that?

1142
01:03:36,317 --> 01:03:37,351
What do you know?

1143
01:03:39,386 --> 01:03:42,089
Hey Irish,
I got this idea,

1144
01:03:42,122 --> 01:03:43,457
if a player can sink at basket

1145
01:03:43,490 --> 01:03:45,993
for much, much further
than normal,

1146
01:03:46,026 --> 01:03:48,095
much further out than normal,

1147
01:03:48,128 --> 01:03:49,930
he should get more
than two points.

1148
01:03:49,963 --> 01:03:51,965
I call it a "three-pointer".
What do you think?

1149
01:03:51,999 --> 01:03:52,900
Phew.

1150
01:03:52,933 --> 01:03:54,602
Jazz up the game a little?

1151
01:03:54,636 --> 01:03:56,203
I don't know,
it sounds pretty crazy, Abe,

1152
01:03:56,236 --> 01:03:57,404
but I don't know if the league
will ever go for it.

1153
01:03:57,438 --> 01:03:58,540
Run it by Podoloff.

1154
01:03:58,573 --> 01:04:00,908
You run it by Podoloff.
What am I, your errand boy?

1155
01:04:00,941 --> 01:04:03,310
Oh, for he--
I'm gonna remember that.

1156
01:04:03,344 --> 01:04:05,346
This guy.

1157
01:04:05,379 --> 01:04:06,380
Hey, Irish.

1158
01:04:07,515 --> 01:04:08,916
-Yeah?
-Promise me

1159
01:04:08,949 --> 01:04:10,084
you'll fight for Sweetwater

1160
01:04:10,117 --> 01:04:11,285
to get enough playing time,

1161
01:04:11,318 --> 01:04:15,122
so the NBA can see
what he can actually do.

1162
01:04:15,155 --> 01:04:16,890
Yeah, sure.

1163
01:04:33,575 --> 01:04:36,076
-We got Sweetwater.
-Yeah, thank you.

1164
01:04:40,648 --> 01:04:42,116
Hey, hey, listen up.

1165
01:04:44,184 --> 01:04:45,486
Made a decision.

1166
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:46,554
Sweetwater,

1167
01:04:48,021 --> 01:04:50,491
that was your last game
wearing a Trotter uniform.

1168
01:04:50,525 --> 01:04:51,659
Oh, come on, Abe.

1169
01:04:51,693 --> 01:04:52,660
Come on,
he's just messing around.

1170
01:04:52,694 --> 01:04:54,562
Hey, I was just having some fun
out there.

1171
01:04:54,596 --> 01:04:56,664
You know, I didn't mean
no harm by that.

1172
01:04:56,698 --> 01:04:58,932
Yeah, your nonsense
on the court

1173
01:04:58,966 --> 01:05:01,402
had nothing to do
with my decision.

1174
01:05:01,435 --> 01:05:02,469
You're done here.

1175
01:05:04,037 --> 01:05:06,907
Ned Irish just bought
your contract from me.

1176
01:05:08,041 --> 01:05:12,446
So, your next game will be
in a Knick jersey.

1177
01:05:15,482 --> 01:05:16,518
- Huh.
- The famed New York

1178
01:05:16,551 --> 01:05:20,988
Knickerbockers, has just hired
Sweetwater Clifton

1179
01:05:21,021 --> 01:05:25,693
with a starting salary
of $2,500,

1180
01:05:25,727 --> 01:05:29,229
and I am the Jewish Abe Lincoln.

1181
01:05:30,264 --> 01:05:34,935
You are free to play
in the NBA.

1182
01:05:42,242 --> 01:05:43,477
Hey, come on,

1183
01:05:45,045 --> 01:05:47,114
I'm representing all of us,
huh.

1184
01:05:47,147 --> 01:05:48,282
Got some.

1185
01:05:50,552 --> 01:05:51,553
Take me with you.

1186
01:05:56,791 --> 01:05:58,292
Love you, brother.

1187
01:06:24,786 --> 01:06:27,622
Welcome to the Knickerbockers,
Sweetwater.

1188
01:06:27,655 --> 01:06:29,624
Thank you, Mr. Irish.

1189
01:06:29,657 --> 01:06:31,124
You ready to change the game?

1190
01:06:31,158 --> 01:06:32,727
Oh, I was born ready.

1191
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:34,629
I believe it.

1192
01:06:34,662 --> 01:06:36,564
-Come on, let's go.
-Alright.

1193
01:06:37,665 --> 01:06:38,766
Welcome.

1194
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,702
Thank you, coach.

1195
01:06:40,735 --> 01:06:42,670
No, no.

1196
01:06:42,704 --> 01:06:46,006
Sweetwater, in the front.

1197
01:06:49,309 --> 01:06:51,178
It's okay.

1198
01:06:51,211 --> 01:06:52,479
Oh, okay.

1199
01:07:36,624 --> 01:07:39,293
But Irish,
you know you can't play him.

1200
01:07:39,326 --> 01:07:42,262
Huh. The hell I can't,
and you can bet I will.

1201
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:45,265
I like to think of him
as the uh,

1202
01:07:45,299 --> 01:07:47,635
as the Jackie Robinson
of the NBA.

1203
01:07:47,669 --> 01:07:50,738
Irish, when you put
a colored player on the court,

1204
01:07:50,772 --> 01:07:53,473
a white player
is sitting on the bench.

1205
01:07:53,508 --> 01:07:56,410
Which America are you living
in, joker?

1206
01:07:56,443 --> 01:07:58,846
'Cause your head is
so far up your ass,

1207
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,480
you forgot what
the land of the free,

1208
01:08:00,515 --> 01:08:02,584
and the home of the brave,
stands for.

1209
01:08:02,617 --> 01:08:03,885
Mm-hmm.

1210
01:08:03,918 --> 01:08:06,219
Okay, uh, excuse us
for one second, please?

1211
01:08:06,253 --> 01:08:07,555
Come here, come here.

1212
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:10,257
You gotta help me out.

1213
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:12,660
I got a board here,
who thinks,

1214
01:08:12,694 --> 01:08:14,461
that you're violating
the decree.

1215
01:08:15,597 --> 01:08:18,332
I'm talking about the future
of the game here, Mo.

1216
01:08:19,634 --> 01:08:23,337
Now, we can either stand
in the way of progress,

1217
01:08:23,370 --> 01:08:26,173
or we can be a part of it.

1218
01:08:26,206 --> 01:08:28,241
You proceed with
a separate agenda like this,

1219
01:08:28,275 --> 01:08:30,612
you're gonna start a war.

1220
01:08:30,645 --> 01:08:32,245
And I'll fight it with you.

1221
01:08:33,948 --> 01:08:35,650
-Okay, as I was saying-
-Okay, ah, excuse me.

1222
01:08:35,683 --> 01:08:38,485
Ah, what-- what my colleague
over here is trying to say

1223
01:08:38,519 --> 01:08:41,556
is that he thinks,
that Sweetwater's style of play

1224
01:08:41,589 --> 01:08:45,258
is going to be uh,
disrespectful to his fans.

1225
01:08:45,292 --> 01:08:46,761
-Exactly.
-Wrong again,

1226
01:08:46,794 --> 01:08:49,262
my distinguished colleagues.

1227
01:08:49,296 --> 01:08:52,399
Sweetwater's style
is pure showmanship.

1228
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:54,301
And the fans love it.

1229
01:08:54,334 --> 01:08:55,536
That's why he's a big draw!

1230
01:08:55,570 --> 01:08:59,540
That's right.
This league, our league,

1231
01:08:59,574 --> 01:09:00,908
is not gonna survive.

1232
01:09:00,942 --> 01:09:04,478
Not with this vanilla style
of play.

1233
01:09:04,512 --> 01:09:06,748
We need some of that,
what'd you call it?

1234
01:09:06,781 --> 01:09:08,549
"Razzle dazzle"?

1235
01:09:08,583 --> 01:09:10,283
Razzle dazzle, indeed.

1236
01:09:10,317 --> 01:09:12,219
-Wh-- what's he doing here?
-Just hear him out.

1237
01:09:12,252 --> 01:09:13,755
Thanks, boss, I appreciate it.

1238
01:09:13,788 --> 01:09:14,722
Hey, Joe.

1239
01:09:15,957 --> 01:09:17,525
Gentlemen, I will be very brief.

1240
01:09:17,558 --> 01:09:21,529
Sweetwater Clifton's style
of play,

1241
01:09:21,562 --> 01:09:23,463
is creative.

1242
01:09:23,497 --> 01:09:24,398
It's innovative.

1243
01:09:24,431 --> 01:09:27,434
And it brings
about a much needed change

1244
01:09:27,467 --> 01:09:28,368
to this game.

1245
01:09:28,402 --> 01:09:30,337
I know change is hard
for you gentlemen,

1246
01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:31,973
but this is the game,
that is--

1247
01:09:32,006 --> 01:09:33,941
that is being played
on the streets.

1248
01:09:33,975 --> 01:09:35,810
It's being played
in colleges.

1249
01:09:35,843 --> 01:09:37,244
The street game
in college plays,

1250
01:09:37,277 --> 01:09:39,212
it's not the pro ranks,
Lapchick.

1251
01:09:39,246 --> 01:09:40,347
It's the future...

1252
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:41,949
- Oh...
- ...Of the NBA.

1253
01:09:41,983 --> 01:09:43,851
Look, we already took a vote,
Ned.

1254
01:09:43,885 --> 01:09:46,688
Yeah well, the fans didn't vote
that way.

1255
01:09:46,721 --> 01:09:47,855
Let me ask you a question.

1256
01:09:47,889 --> 01:09:50,457
Who sells more tickets
than any other basketball team?

1257
01:09:50,490 --> 01:09:52,292
Go ahead, take a guess,
go ahead.

1258
01:09:52,325 --> 01:09:54,394
We all know it's the Trotters,
Irish.

1259
01:09:54,428 --> 01:09:56,698
That's right.
And since it's been decided

1260
01:09:56,731 --> 01:09:57,865
by the board of governors,

1261
01:09:57,899 --> 01:10:00,568
to not let the Trotters
have a franchise in this league,

1262
01:10:00,601 --> 01:10:01,736
I say,

1263
01:10:01,769 --> 01:10:05,238
we all draft great negro players
and put 'em on our teams.

1264
01:10:06,874 --> 01:10:08,609
How about one each, huh?

1265
01:10:09,744 --> 01:10:11,344
We each pick one player.

1266
01:10:11,378 --> 01:10:13,614
I mean, how hard is that?

1267
01:10:13,648 --> 01:10:14,615
It's what the fans want.

1268
01:10:14,649 --> 01:10:15,750
That's New York fans.

1269
01:10:15,783 --> 01:10:17,417
You don't know my fans.

1270
01:10:17,451 --> 01:10:19,954
What we're trying to get
through to you,

1271
01:10:19,987 --> 01:10:21,589
it's that times change.

1272
01:10:21,622 --> 01:10:23,457
You know,
it wasn't too long ago,

1273
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:26,627
that a Jew wasn't permitted
to set foot on a hardwood,

1274
01:10:26,661 --> 01:10:28,495
never mind own a team.

1275
01:10:28,529 --> 01:10:30,765
Now, I have three Jewish
players on my roster.

1276
01:10:30,798 --> 01:10:33,568
So, what I'm trying to say
to you is, schmuck!

1277
01:10:33,601 --> 01:10:34,602
Don't be a schmuck!

1278
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:37,638
Look, no matter how you feel
about this,

1279
01:10:37,672 --> 01:10:39,741
-it's good for business.
-Now, you're talking.

1280
01:10:39,774 --> 01:10:42,009
Irish, let's say that I

1281
01:10:42,043 --> 01:10:44,679
go along
with your letting negros

1282
01:10:44,712 --> 01:10:47,515
into the league program,
what does that make me?

1283
01:10:47,548 --> 01:10:49,416
Does that make me your friend?

1284
01:10:50,818 --> 01:10:52,486
You know what this is?

1285
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:53,521
Huh?

1286
01:10:53,554 --> 01:10:54,555
You see that?

1287
01:10:55,690 --> 01:10:58,993
That, is my gate take
for the Knickerbocker season.

1288
01:10:59,026 --> 01:11:00,628
The whole season, $1,

1289
01:11:01,729 --> 01:11:04,732
That'll buy you a hot dog
and an orange drink.

1290
01:11:04,766 --> 01:11:05,666
on me.

1291
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:06,901
Be my guest.

1292
01:11:06,934 --> 01:11:11,773
Irish, why are you fighting
so hard for this negro player?

1293
01:11:11,806 --> 01:11:13,406
Because he fought for us.

1294
01:11:14,474 --> 01:11:16,611
Sergeant Sweetwater Clifton

1295
01:11:16,644 --> 01:11:19,479
is a veteran
of the United States Army.

1296
01:11:19,514 --> 01:11:21,481
Sounds pretty distinguished
to me.

1297
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:24,317
So uh,

1298
01:11:25,385 --> 01:11:26,754
shall we continue
with the draft?

1299
01:11:26,788 --> 01:11:31,424
Okay, uh, next up
is the Celtics' Walter Brown.

1300
01:11:31,458 --> 01:11:34,629
The Boston Celtics pick
Chuck Cooper from Duquesne.

1301
01:11:34,662 --> 01:11:37,765
We all know we allow
colored players into the draft,

1302
01:11:37,799 --> 01:11:41,502
but by gentlemen's agreement,
we don't actually select them.

1303
01:11:41,536 --> 01:11:43,070
He's eligible for the draft,
isn't he?

1304
01:11:43,104 --> 01:11:43,938
Yeah.

1305
01:11:43,971 --> 01:11:46,808
Well, then, I don't care
if he's striped,

1306
01:11:46,841 --> 01:11:48,441
plaid, polka dot,

1307
01:11:48,475 --> 01:11:52,046
the Boston Celtics
pick Chuck Cooper from Duquesne.

1308
01:11:52,079 --> 01:11:53,346
Okay, next up.

1309
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:54,582
Washington Capitals.

1310
01:11:54,615 --> 01:11:55,516
Mr. McKinney.

1311
01:11:55,550 --> 01:11:58,820
The Washington Capital
select Earl Lloyd,

1312
01:11:58,853 --> 01:12:00,521
West Virginia State.

1313
01:12:00,555 --> 01:12:02,355
Okay, look,
I'm not telling you again,

1314
01:12:02,389 --> 01:12:05,392
you cannot draft negros!

1315
01:12:05,425 --> 01:12:06,561
Have you seen this guy play?

1316
01:12:06,594 --> 01:12:08,963
Have you seen any of these guys
play?

1317
01:12:08,996 --> 01:12:10,097
We have rules, Podoloff.

1318
01:12:11,398 --> 01:12:12,633
Maybe I want a negro
on my team, huh?

1319
01:12:12,667 --> 01:12:13,734
You're too late.

1320
01:12:13,768 --> 01:12:15,670
You should've made a motion
before.

1321
01:12:15,703 --> 01:12:17,738
- What happened today...
- Alright.

1322
01:12:17,772 --> 01:12:18,973
Hey, hey, hey.

1323
01:12:19,006 --> 01:12:20,975
Over here, Earl.

1324
01:12:21,008 --> 01:12:22,243
Mr. Cooper! Mr. Cooper!

1325
01:12:22,276 --> 01:12:24,145
- One right here.
- Mr. Clifton!

1326
01:12:24,178 --> 01:12:26,747
Philadelphia Post, Mr. Lloyd,
we'll start with you.

1327
01:12:26,781 --> 01:12:28,783
How does it feel to be
competing to become

1328
01:12:28,816 --> 01:12:30,818
the first color player?

1329
01:12:30,852 --> 01:12:32,485
To play in the NBA?

1330
01:12:34,021 --> 01:12:35,623
Oh man, um...

1331
01:12:37,625 --> 01:12:40,561
I'm just a small town kid, man,
um, you know.

1332
01:12:42,029 --> 01:12:43,731
I'll be lying to you, man,
if I--

1333
01:12:43,764 --> 01:12:46,968
if I didn't tell you that it
is, it's quite frightening.

1334
01:12:47,001 --> 01:12:48,636
Right. Thank you.

1335
01:12:48,669 --> 01:12:49,770
Mr. Cooper?

1336
01:12:49,804 --> 01:12:51,739
Same question.

1337
01:12:51,772 --> 01:12:53,040
I can say,

1338
01:12:53,074 --> 01:12:54,542
I probably feel
how Jackie Robinson

1339
01:12:54,575 --> 01:12:56,577
felt a couple of years ago.

1340
01:12:56,611 --> 01:12:59,614
Um, for me,
this is a dream come true.

1341
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,615
I grew up playing basketball.

1342
01:13:00,648 --> 01:13:04,484
and now I get to play
at the highest level.

1343
01:13:04,518 --> 01:13:06,721
And to get paid to do
what I love.

1344
01:13:06,754 --> 01:13:08,890
It's-- it's crazy.

1345
01:13:10,691 --> 01:13:12,459
Mr. Clifton,

1346
01:13:12,492 --> 01:13:14,494
before signing with the Knicks,

1347
01:13:14,528 --> 01:13:17,765
you were a basketball star
in your right.

1348
01:13:17,798 --> 01:13:18,699
And some say,

1349
01:13:18,733 --> 01:13:21,502
the best basketball player
in the world.

1350
01:13:21,535 --> 01:13:24,437
And now, you're in the NBA.

1351
01:13:25,206 --> 01:13:26,741
What's going through your mind?

1352
01:13:27,775 --> 01:13:29,911
I don't think it's about
who's the best.

1353
01:13:31,212 --> 01:13:33,648
Yeah, see.

1354
01:13:33,681 --> 01:13:37,985
Ever since I was a young boy,
I always felt like I'm adapting.

1355
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:40,988
My whole life's been like that.

1356
01:13:42,256 --> 01:13:45,492
That's something we get
from our parents to survive.

1357
01:13:46,761 --> 01:13:50,197
I believe that the three of us,

1358
01:13:50,231 --> 01:13:55,136
Chuck Cooper, Earl Lloyd,
and myself

1359
01:13:55,169 --> 01:13:57,939
can walk away from the past.

1360
01:13:57,972 --> 01:14:00,508
Right place, right time.

1361
01:14:01,509 --> 01:14:03,744
And now is the time,

1362
01:14:03,778 --> 01:14:06,747
we can all make
a change together.

1363
01:14:22,997 --> 01:14:23,998
Oh say, man,

1364
01:14:24,031 --> 01:14:25,498
you have any
leftover late night

1365
01:14:25,533 --> 01:14:26,600
corned beef back there?

1366
01:15:03,437 --> 01:15:04,739
Nate Sweetwater Clifton?

1367
01:15:04,772 --> 01:15:06,007
I thought I recognized you.

1368
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:07,108
Oh, uh, it's Nat.

1369
01:15:07,141 --> 01:15:08,609
Oh, that's right.

1370
01:15:08,642 --> 01:15:09,610
Did I hear you're gonna
be starting

1371
01:15:09,643 --> 01:15:10,878
for the Knicks this season?

1372
01:15:10,911 --> 01:15:12,179
Yes, sir.

1373
01:15:12,213 --> 01:15:14,515
Wow, that's uh, that's great.

1374
01:15:15,950 --> 01:15:17,218
What are we drinking here?
It's on me.

1375
01:15:17,251 --> 01:15:18,552
Waiter!

1376
01:15:18,586 --> 01:15:21,055
Oh, nothing for me.

1377
01:15:21,088 --> 01:15:22,156
Thanks.

1378
01:15:22,189 --> 01:15:23,858
Got a early practice tomorrow.

1379
01:15:23,891 --> 01:15:26,594
Come on, I just got here.
Maybe I can sit down

1380
01:15:26,627 --> 01:15:27,795
and talk to you
about something,

1381
01:15:27,828 --> 01:15:30,097
like uh, a business proposition.

1382
01:15:30,131 --> 01:15:31,766
What kind
of business proposition?

1383
01:15:38,773 --> 01:15:41,809
Oh, I'ma stay here
and finish my meal.

1384
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:44,879
But thanks anyways, fellas.

1385
01:15:46,013 --> 01:15:46,981
I insist.

1386
01:15:48,082 --> 01:15:49,016
Not tonight.

1387
01:15:54,121 --> 01:15:56,290
It was nice chatting with you.

1388
01:15:56,323 --> 01:15:57,124
Enjoy that meal.

1389
01:16:26,821 --> 01:16:30,124
Hey Nate, where you going?

1390
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:33,861
You know what I just heard,

1391
01:16:35,863 --> 01:16:38,999
I just heard that
your little basketball practice

1392
01:16:40,334 --> 01:16:42,103
was canceled.

1393
01:16:42,136 --> 01:16:43,204
Is that right?

1394
01:16:50,177 --> 01:16:51,112
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1395
01:16:51,145 --> 01:16:52,379
Stop! Hey!

1396
01:16:52,413 --> 01:16:54,348
What kind of animals are you?

1397
01:16:54,381 --> 01:16:56,750
You best not show up today
or tomorrow.

1398
01:16:56,784 --> 01:16:58,018
There'll be more of this.

1399
01:17:03,124 --> 01:17:04,725
Hey, you alright?

1400
01:17:05,693 --> 01:17:06,961
Come on, come on.

1401
01:17:35,456 --> 01:17:38,092
I'll be damned,

1402
01:17:38,125 --> 01:17:40,961
the way you bend them notes.

1403
01:17:40,995 --> 01:17:43,030
You sure you ain't got
no negro blood in you, honey?

1404
01:17:45,432 --> 01:17:46,934
-Oh.
-Here you go.

1405
01:17:46,967 --> 01:17:48,269
-Thank you.
-See you again.

1406
01:17:52,473 --> 01:17:54,208
It's like neither of us belong.

1407
01:17:55,342 --> 01:17:58,812
Me, playing
in a white man's game.

1408
01:17:59,847 --> 01:18:01,916
You, singing them blues.

1409
01:18:04,251 --> 01:18:06,120
T-Bone came by the club earlier.

1410
01:18:07,888 --> 01:18:10,157
Wants me to officially
go on the road with him.

1411
01:18:10,191 --> 01:18:11,325
Hmm.

1412
01:18:11,358 --> 01:18:12,359
I leave tomorrow morning.

1413
01:18:12,393 --> 01:18:14,428
Haha.

1414
01:18:14,461 --> 01:18:17,097
You are a happening.

1415
01:18:17,131 --> 01:18:19,934
And that happening,
is thanks to you.

1416
01:18:19,967 --> 01:18:20,968
Oh.

1417
01:18:21,001 --> 01:18:24,838
It's happening 'cause you
are one talented soul.

1418
01:18:26,774 --> 01:18:29,143
Black folk gonna love you.

1419
01:18:29,176 --> 01:18:30,344
White folk gonna love you.

1420
01:18:30,377 --> 01:18:33,047
Oh, and they already do.

1421
01:18:39,521 --> 01:18:41,121
I'm forever grateful.

1422
01:18:42,122 --> 01:18:43,123
Hm.

1423
01:19:04,411 --> 01:19:05,980
-I'm sorry.
-Hey, Irish?

1424
01:19:06,013 --> 01:19:07,448
-Yeah.
-I got a message.

1425
01:19:13,187 --> 01:19:14,321
You want to stay healthy?

1426
01:19:15,422 --> 01:19:17,258
Don't play the negro.

1427
01:19:19,927 --> 01:19:22,129
Damn, son of a bitch!

1428
01:19:27,434 --> 01:19:28,435
-Mr. Irish.
-Get him, Tom!

1429
01:19:28,469 --> 01:19:30,137
Get him!

1430
01:19:31,305 --> 01:19:33,040
Hey, stop!

1431
01:19:36,343 --> 01:19:38,513
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1432
01:19:38,546 --> 01:19:40,147
Okay, here you go.

1433
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:41,248
Thank you, buddy.

1434
01:19:47,955 --> 01:19:49,156
I will go get that.

1435
01:19:49,189 --> 01:19:50,090
Alright.

1436
01:19:53,894 --> 01:19:55,429
Hello. Lapchick residence.

1437
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:04,104
Who was it, sweetie?

1438
01:20:04,138 --> 01:20:04,706
I don't know.

1439
01:20:04,739 --> 01:20:06,206
They mumbled and hung up.

1440
01:20:07,474 --> 01:20:09,143
It's probably a wrong number.

1441
01:20:09,176 --> 01:20:10,110
Yeah.

1442
01:20:11,579 --> 01:20:12,980
Dad?

1443
01:20:13,013 --> 01:20:14,582
Yes.

1444
01:20:14,616 --> 01:20:17,184
My friends at school
say we're nigger lovers.

1445
01:20:17,217 --> 01:20:18,285
Is that true?

1446
01:20:28,962 --> 01:20:33,400
Son, that is a word
of disrespect.

1447
01:20:33,434 --> 01:20:37,304
And we don't ever use that word
in this household, ever.

1448
01:20:37,338 --> 01:20:38,906
You understand?

1449
01:20:38,939 --> 01:20:40,841
Never again, never again.

1450
01:20:41,909 --> 01:20:43,110
I understand, dad.

1451
01:20:49,016 --> 01:20:50,652
Nice shot.

1452
01:20:50,685 --> 01:20:52,520
Nice shot.

1453
01:20:52,554 --> 01:20:54,221
Wait till you see this kid.

1454
01:20:56,591 --> 01:20:58,959
Come on. Put it up, put it up.

1455
01:20:58,992 --> 01:21:00,127
Watch this guy.

1456
01:21:02,096 --> 01:21:04,398
Hey, hey, newest New York Knick.

1457
01:21:10,605 --> 01:21:12,940
Don't know how you missed
that free though.

1458
01:21:13,708 --> 01:21:17,111
You're an All-Star, right?

1459
01:21:17,144 --> 01:21:18,580
Having an off night,
you know how that goes?

1460
01:21:18,613 --> 01:21:22,082
Oh... Me, I can't afford
to have an off night.

1461
01:21:22,116 --> 01:21:27,454
And I especially can't afford
to miss any free throws.

1462
01:21:30,324 --> 01:21:31,526
They're free.

1463
01:21:35,329 --> 01:21:36,430
I like this guy, he's fun.

1464
01:21:37,965 --> 01:21:39,634
Alright, come on now.

1465
01:21:39,667 --> 01:21:41,001
Let me show y'all something.

1466
01:21:41,034 --> 01:21:42,403
Over there, McGuire.

1467
01:21:42,436 --> 01:21:44,171
Max, Vandeweghe.

1468
01:21:44,204 --> 01:21:45,607
Vince.

1469
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:47,441
You keep it.

1470
01:21:47,474 --> 01:21:48,909
I'll take that, Mr. Clifton.

1471
01:21:50,612 --> 01:21:52,479
Alright.

1472
01:21:52,514 --> 01:21:56,651
Alright, pass to Vandeweghe,
criss cross in front of me.

1473
01:21:56,684 --> 01:21:57,951
Oh, no. Hold on.

1474
01:21:57,985 --> 01:21:59,386
Stop, stop. Go back.

1475
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:00,487
Go back to him.

1476
01:22:04,592 --> 01:22:05,959
You see this ball?

1477
01:22:07,161 --> 01:22:09,329
This ball has life.

1478
01:22:09,363 --> 01:22:12,099
You can't just treat it
any kind of way.

1479
01:22:13,701 --> 01:22:15,402
You got to cherish it.

1480
01:22:15,436 --> 01:22:17,070
Give it your best.

1481
01:22:17,104 --> 01:22:19,139
Put some love in it.

1482
01:22:19,173 --> 01:22:20,742
And watch what
it give you back.

1483
01:22:20,775 --> 01:22:23,678
So, don't just pass the ball
any kind of way,

1484
01:22:23,711 --> 01:22:25,513
put some love in it.

1485
01:22:26,748 --> 01:22:29,082
You got to cherish it.

1486
01:22:29,116 --> 01:22:30,083
Right.

1487
01:22:30,117 --> 01:22:31,653
Just like that, snap it!

1488
01:22:31,686 --> 01:22:33,487
No. On target.

1489
01:22:33,521 --> 01:22:34,455
Have a goal.

1490
01:22:34,488 --> 01:22:36,023
Accomplish it.

1491
01:22:36,056 --> 01:22:38,091
Right, put some love on it.

1492
01:22:40,127 --> 01:22:42,129
The man is taking control.

1493
01:22:43,631 --> 01:22:46,366
- Yeah.
- *

1494
01:22:47,635 --> 01:22:48,969
Free for Vandeweghe.

1495
01:22:51,271 --> 01:22:52,306
Oh!

1496
01:22:52,339 --> 01:22:55,142
Don't worry about it,
you'll get the hang of it.

1497
01:22:55,175 --> 01:22:55,976
What are you guys
talking about it?

1498
01:22:56,009 --> 01:22:57,478
His pass is way more
faster than you.

1499
01:22:57,512 --> 01:22:58,713
Alright, gentlemen.

1500
01:22:58,746 --> 01:23:00,748
Enough clowning around.

1501
01:23:00,782 --> 01:23:03,217
Max, let's run up some plays.

1502
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:04,719
A little half court offense.

1503
01:23:04,752 --> 01:23:06,286
Let's go, gentlemen.

1504
01:23:07,454 --> 01:23:08,422
Okay.

1505
01:23:08,455 --> 01:23:10,357
Keep it, keep it moving.

1506
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:11,626
Find the extra pass.

1507
01:23:11,659 --> 01:23:12,694
Get that momentum.

1508
01:23:12,727 --> 01:23:15,496
Get that-- okay.

1509
01:23:15,530 --> 01:23:16,764
Alright.

1510
01:23:16,798 --> 01:23:20,635
I'm telling you, Mo,
this story is big.

1511
01:23:20,668 --> 01:23:22,504
All the radio
and the news...

1512
01:23:22,537 --> 01:23:24,606
Oh come on, come on.

1513
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:26,741
Everybody likes good press.

1514
01:23:26,774 --> 01:23:28,408
The attention's good
for everyone.

1515
01:23:28,442 --> 01:23:30,410
Not everyone.

1516
01:23:30,444 --> 01:23:32,379
Ah, that's nothing.

1517
01:23:32,412 --> 01:23:34,381
All these guys,
they're gonna fall into line,

1518
01:23:34,414 --> 01:23:35,683
once they see the fans
in the seats.

1519
01:23:35,717 --> 01:23:37,217
Just to admit to me,

1520
01:23:37,251 --> 01:23:41,054
this is causing some
serious problems.

1521
01:23:41,088 --> 01:23:42,524
You met the man.

1522
01:23:42,557 --> 01:23:43,791
Now that I know which one he is.

1523
01:23:43,825 --> 01:23:44,926
No,
but you've never met him, right?

1524
01:23:44,959 --> 01:23:46,528
No, I haven't met him,
but he's in the middle practice.

1525
01:23:46,561 --> 01:23:47,662
Well, let's go say hi to him.

1526
01:23:47,695 --> 01:23:49,062
Come on, let's go say hi.

1527
01:23:49,096 --> 01:23:50,330
Well, he's busy.

1528
01:23:50,364 --> 01:23:51,699
I don't wanna break
his concentration--

1529
01:23:51,733 --> 01:23:56,036
Mo, Mo, he's not gonna
bite you,
okay.

1530
01:23:58,773 --> 01:24:00,040
Hey Sweets,

1531
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:03,811
I want you to meet
the President of the League.

1532
01:24:03,845 --> 01:24:05,713
This is Maurice Podoloff.

1533
01:24:05,747 --> 01:24:08,683
Mo, meet
Nat Sweetwater Clifton.

1534
01:24:08,716 --> 01:24:11,719
Mr. Podoloff,
a pleasure, sir.

1535
01:24:11,753 --> 01:24:12,820
Ah.

1536
01:24:12,854 --> 01:24:15,455
Sergeant, it is my honor.

1537
01:24:15,489 --> 01:24:17,859
Oh, listen, it's...
It's nice to be here.

1538
01:24:17,892 --> 01:24:22,362
Actually, before I forget,
this is yours.

1539
01:24:27,334 --> 01:24:30,237
A check,
to a colored man?

1540
01:24:31,806 --> 01:24:34,074
That'll bounce higher
than a basketball.

1541
01:24:34,776 --> 01:24:36,376
-Right.
-Ah.

1542
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:38,646
If we could figure out
a cash situation.

1543
01:24:40,247 --> 01:24:41,015
Thank you, Sergeant,

1544
01:24:41,049 --> 01:24:43,483
for bringing it
to our attention.

1545
01:24:43,518 --> 01:24:45,452
And I want to tell you
how happy we are

1546
01:24:45,485 --> 01:24:49,089
that it's you, who's breaking
the color line in the NBA.

1547
01:24:54,729 --> 01:24:57,397
<i>Earl Lloyd scores a basket,</i>
<i>and makes history.</i>

1548
01:24:57,431 --> 01:24:59,734
<i>And he becomes</i>
<i>the first negro player</i>

1549
01:24:59,767 --> 01:25:01,569
<i>to play in the NBA.</i>

1550
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:14,314
Someone's here early.

1551
01:25:14,348 --> 01:25:16,183
Oh, going to get some shots up,
you know,

1552
01:25:16,216 --> 01:25:17,351
get stretched out and all.

1553
01:25:17,384 --> 01:25:18,886
How about little one-on-one
rematch?

1554
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:19,921
I don't think you want that,

1555
01:25:19,954 --> 01:25:20,989
-coach.
-I was trying

1556
01:25:21,022 --> 01:25:22,489
-to kill your confidence.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1557
01:25:22,523 --> 01:25:23,858
Have you guys seen
today's paper?

1558
01:25:23,891 --> 01:25:26,293
Huh? Here, read, read.

1559
01:25:26,326 --> 01:25:27,562
What the hell's going on?

1560
01:25:27,595 --> 01:25:30,364
Earl Lloyd played for the
Capitals last night

1561
01:25:30,397 --> 01:25:32,366
in Rochester. In Rochester,
for crying out loud!

1562
01:25:32,399 --> 01:25:33,568
"Earl Lloyd...

1563
01:25:33,601 --> 01:25:35,637
...his first game in the NBA.
His appearance also marked

1564
01:25:35,670 --> 01:25:36,638
-the first time..."
-Yeah.

1565
01:25:36,671 --> 01:25:39,607
"...a negro man played
in the new NBA league,

1566
01:25:39,641 --> 01:25:41,743
overshadowing tonight's game
in the New York..."

1567
01:25:41,776 --> 01:25:43,745
I don't under...

1568
01:25:43,778 --> 01:25:45,312
The season starts tonight.

1569
01:25:45,345 --> 01:25:47,314
Yeah, supposed to, should have.

1570
01:25:47,347 --> 01:25:48,415
Didn't!

1571
01:25:53,821 --> 01:25:57,592
Listen, that's good
for Earl Lloyd.

1572
01:26:02,262 --> 01:26:04,464
I think I know who's
responsible for this.

1573
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:13,975
Hey Mo, what's this uh,

1574
01:26:14,008 --> 01:26:18,412
October 31st game
in Rochester crap, huh?

1575
01:26:18,445 --> 01:26:20,480
It's not even
a regular season game.

1576
01:26:20,515 --> 01:26:22,617
According to the official
NBA schedule,

1577
01:26:22,650 --> 01:26:23,818
the season starts tonight.

1578
01:26:23,851 --> 01:26:25,318
November 1st,
in the Garden!

1579
01:26:25,352 --> 01:26:26,821
Yeah, not this year, Ned.

1580
01:26:26,854 --> 01:26:27,822
"Oh, don't worry, Ned.

1581
01:26:27,855 --> 01:26:29,824
I got your back.
I'll fight your war for you."

1582
01:26:29,857 --> 01:26:31,425
Yeah, sure. Yeah, sure!

1583
01:26:31,458 --> 01:26:33,226
Hey! Hey!

1584
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:34,729
Just for the record,

1585
01:26:34,762 --> 01:26:37,899
the president has every right
to change the schedule

1586
01:26:37,932 --> 01:26:39,299
at his discretion.

1587
01:26:39,332 --> 01:26:40,601
It's in the bylaws.
Look it up.

1588
01:26:40,635 --> 01:26:41,769
Why'd you do it, Mo?

1589
01:26:41,803 --> 01:26:43,303
Why? Why?

1590
01:26:43,336 --> 01:26:45,940
There was a prediction
of a severe weather storm

1591
01:26:45,973 --> 01:26:48,943
in Rochester tonight!

1592
01:26:48,976 --> 01:26:50,243
So, I changed the schedule.

1593
01:26:50,277 --> 01:26:51,913
Oh, what a load of bull.

1594
01:26:51,946 --> 01:26:53,981
Yesterday, was great
for the league.

1595
01:26:54,015 --> 01:26:56,651
No! It was fantastic for the
league!

1596
01:26:56,684 --> 01:26:59,721
But that was supposed
to be Sweetwater's moment!

1597
01:26:59,754 --> 01:27:01,589
Tonight! In my Garden!

1598
01:27:01,622 --> 01:27:03,725
In New York!
Everybody knew that!

1599
01:27:03,758 --> 01:27:05,292
You knew that!

1600
01:27:06,426 --> 01:27:08,930
You took it away
from the game!

1601
01:27:08,963 --> 01:27:10,497
From the fans!

1602
01:27:11,933 --> 01:27:13,534
But more importantly,
you took it away

1603
01:27:13,568 --> 01:27:14,669
from Sweetwater.

1604
01:27:16,436 --> 01:27:18,271
Too much power for one negro.

1605
01:27:18,305 --> 01:27:19,841
Too big a moment
for the bozos, right?

1606
01:27:19,874 --> 01:27:22,309
Hey. There's nothing I can do
about predicting the weather.

1607
01:27:22,342 --> 01:27:24,746
Oh, don't give me that crap, Mo!

1608
01:27:24,779 --> 01:27:26,681
New York City is center stage!

1609
01:27:26,714 --> 01:27:29,483
The impact here would have been
heard everywhere.

1610
01:27:29,517 --> 01:27:31,519
Just level with me.
Give me a reason.

1611
01:27:31,552 --> 01:27:33,821
You just heard it,
you just said it,

1612
01:27:33,855 --> 01:27:35,623
you just heard it.

1613
01:27:35,656 --> 01:27:37,491
Change is happening.

1614
01:27:37,525 --> 01:27:40,962
But I don't know that my city
can take it, do you?

1615
01:27:40,995 --> 01:27:42,395
Are you sure?

1616
01:27:42,429 --> 01:27:44,899
I don't care about uh...

1617
01:27:44,932 --> 01:27:46,567
confusion in Rochester.

1618
01:27:46,601 --> 01:27:48,401
Who cares?

1619
01:27:48,435 --> 01:27:51,773
But Madison Square Garden,
in the middle of Manhattan?

1620
01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:54,742
You want blood on the floor?

1621
01:27:55,710 --> 01:27:59,279
You want rioting
on Madison Square Garden?

1622
01:28:00,081 --> 01:28:01,916
Huh, I don't-- I don't want
that.

1623
01:28:01,949 --> 01:28:03,551
I don't want that.

1624
01:28:05,418 --> 01:28:07,420
Is that a good enough reason
for you?

1625
01:28:10,858 --> 01:28:12,560
So, Earl Lloyd, Rochester,

1626
01:28:12,593 --> 01:28:14,562
he-- he gets to make history,
and we got what?

1627
01:28:14,595 --> 01:28:17,532
Nothing.
Sweetwater gets nothing.

1628
01:28:17,565 --> 01:28:20,535
Because of what? Some-- some
freaking scheduling glitch.

1629
01:28:20,568 --> 01:28:23,638
Some, some freaking
history making.

1630
01:28:25,573 --> 01:28:28,408
History-making scheduling
glitch.

1631
01:28:39,554 --> 01:28:41,122
You gonna play
Sweetwater tonight?

1632
01:28:43,057 --> 01:28:44,357
What if I do?

1633
01:28:45,793 --> 01:28:47,862
Dangerous, could be trouble.

1634
01:28:49,496 --> 01:28:51,132
I certainly hope so.

1635
01:28:51,999 --> 01:28:53,501
Save me a seat.

1636
01:28:53,534 --> 01:28:55,435
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

1637
01:29:03,110 --> 01:29:04,377
And tonight marks

1638
01:29:04,411 --> 01:29:07,480
Nat Sweetwater Clifton's
first game

1639
01:29:07,515 --> 01:29:08,983
as an NBA player.

1640
01:29:09,016 --> 01:29:09,951
That remains to be seen,

1641
01:29:09,984 --> 01:29:12,920
if Clifton can really complete
in the NBA.

1642
01:29:15,022 --> 01:29:16,524
Set the tone early.

1643
01:29:16,557 --> 01:29:17,892
Fundamental basketball.

1644
01:29:17,925 --> 01:29:19,492
Leave your heart
on that court.

1645
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:24,899
Sweet, you're starting.

1646
01:29:38,713 --> 01:29:40,413
Hey, that's Sweetwater!

1647
01:30:26,961 --> 01:30:28,062
And this is the moment

1648
01:30:28,095 --> 01:30:30,463
we've all been waiting for.

1649
01:30:30,497 --> 01:30:32,432
History in the making.

1650
01:30:37,905 --> 01:30:40,207
Folks, I wish you could see
what I'm seeing right now.

1651
01:30:40,241 --> 01:30:42,843
The emotion on Sweetwater's face

1652
01:30:42,877 --> 01:30:44,779
and the crowd here looking
at Clifton,

1653
01:30:44,812 --> 01:30:47,648
there is history in the air
here at the Garden.

1654
01:30:54,555 --> 01:30:55,957
That's a travel.

1655
01:30:55,990 --> 01:30:57,457
Indianapolis ball.

1656
01:30:59,527 --> 01:31:01,062
Good call, good call.

1657
01:31:02,663 --> 01:31:03,965
Rebound, rebound.

1658
01:31:03,998 --> 01:31:05,666
Rebound. Rebound.

1659
01:31:10,171 --> 01:31:11,839
There we go. Break it.

1660
01:31:11,872 --> 01:31:12,940
On the break.

1661
01:31:14,108 --> 01:31:14,775
Beautiful.

1662
01:31:15,977 --> 01:31:17,745
Yeah!

1663
01:31:17,778 --> 01:31:19,981
No! No basket!

1664
01:31:20,014 --> 01:31:21,082
That's a travel.

1665
01:31:21,115 --> 01:31:22,516
Blue ball.

1666
01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:23,718
What are you talking about,
Donnie?

1667
01:31:23,751 --> 01:31:24,852
What are you calling here?

1668
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:27,521
Good call, Donnie.

1669
01:31:33,294 --> 01:31:33,995
Come on.

1670
01:31:35,830 --> 01:31:39,100
That's a foul,
number eight New York.

1671
01:31:39,133 --> 01:31:40,735
Olympian ball.

1672
01:31:42,837 --> 01:31:44,905
Olympians with the ball.

1673
01:31:44,939 --> 01:31:46,707
It's up, it's good.

1674
01:31:46,741 --> 01:31:48,009
A good start
for the Olympians.

1675
01:31:48,042 --> 01:31:49,510
What a great move.

1676
01:31:51,278 --> 01:31:53,180
Open there.

1677
01:31:53,214 --> 01:31:54,715
Get it to Sweets.

1678
01:31:57,251 --> 01:31:58,886
Out of bounds,
on the Knicks,

1679
01:31:58,919 --> 01:32:01,022
and Sweetwater continues
to struggle

1680
01:32:01,055 --> 01:32:03,057
in these opening minutes
of the game, folks.

1681
01:32:04,291 --> 01:32:05,593
Oh yeah! That's it.

1682
01:32:05,626 --> 01:32:06,894
That's what we're looking for.

1683
01:32:06,927 --> 01:32:08,629
Come on, guys.

1684
01:32:08,662 --> 01:32:10,164
- We gotta put past.
- There you go.

1685
01:32:10,197 --> 01:32:12,133
McGuire passes to Gallatin,

1686
01:32:12,166 --> 01:32:13,834
hook shot,
and it's no good.

1687
01:32:13,868 --> 01:32:16,971
- It's okay, kid.
- Oh!

1688
01:32:17,004 --> 01:32:19,640
Sweetwater goes down hard.

1689
01:32:19,673 --> 01:32:21,709
Oh my goodness,
I hope he's not injured.

1690
01:32:23,077 --> 01:32:24,812
That's a foul.

1691
01:32:24,845 --> 01:32:26,614
Get the pass. There you go.

1692
01:32:26,647 --> 01:32:27,915
There you go,
keep it moving.

1693
01:32:29,216 --> 01:32:31,052
Get back on team.
Get back on team.

1694
01:32:31,085 --> 01:32:32,053
Come on, Sweets.

1695
01:32:32,086 --> 01:32:33,320
And the Olympians score,

1696
01:32:33,354 --> 01:32:35,956
as they continue
to build on their league.

1697
01:32:38,859 --> 01:32:40,127
There we go, there we go.

1698
01:32:40,161 --> 01:32:42,830
And here's Sweetwater,
with a little razzle dazzle.

1699
01:32:42,863 --> 01:32:44,865
A beautiful move
to the basket, and it's good!

1700
01:32:46,700 --> 01:32:48,169
Let's go. Giddy up, giddy up.

1701
01:32:48,202 --> 01:32:49,870
Yeah!

1702
01:32:49,904 --> 01:32:51,038
Hold on.

1703
01:33:04,051 --> 01:33:05,653
What was that, Howard?

1704
01:33:05,686 --> 01:33:07,021
I think that was a new kind
of shot.

1705
01:33:07,054 --> 01:33:10,124
Looked like a donut being
dunked in a cup of coffee.

1706
01:33:10,157 --> 01:33:11,592
Let's call it a "dunk".

1707
01:33:14,695 --> 01:33:15,863
What's going on?

1708
01:33:17,264 --> 01:33:18,966
Was that...

1709
01:33:20,267 --> 01:33:21,135
I got it, I got it.

1710
01:33:21,168 --> 01:33:23,104
Alright, that's gonna be
a technical foul.

1711
01:33:24,738 --> 01:33:27,208
- No basket, no basket.
- Indianapolis ball.

1712
01:33:27,241 --> 01:33:28,375
Technical foul?

1713
01:33:28,409 --> 01:33:29,410
- Yeah.
- No, no basket?

1714
01:33:29,443 --> 01:33:31,846
Did you miss me doing this?
This is no basket.

1715
01:33:31,879 --> 01:33:33,848
I don't understand,
but what is the actual call?

1716
01:33:33,881 --> 01:33:34,682
They did not do
a basketball move.

1717
01:33:34,715 --> 01:33:35,783
This is just because,
you didn't--

1718
01:33:35,816 --> 01:33:39,120
you've never seen it before,
doesn't make it illegal.

1719
01:33:39,153 --> 01:33:40,421
We got a technical foul.

1720
01:33:40,454 --> 01:33:41,956
In number eight
of the New York Knicks.

1721
01:33:41,989 --> 01:33:44,024
-Tell me what the call is.
-Get off the court!

1722
01:33:44,058 --> 01:33:45,226
Get behind the line!

1723
01:33:45,259 --> 01:33:46,660
You're-- you're out of line,
Donnie!

1724
01:33:46,694 --> 01:33:48,762
Here we go. Technical foul!

1725
01:33:48,796 --> 01:33:50,064
All the coach in the Knicks
have it.

1726
01:33:50,097 --> 01:33:51,866
That's a ridiculous call!

1727
01:33:51,899 --> 01:33:54,268
-You don't know...
-I did not want to do this, Joe.

1728
01:33:54,301 --> 01:33:55,369
I did not wanna do it.

1729
01:33:55,402 --> 01:33:56,670
I didn't wanna do it!

1730
01:33:56,704 --> 01:33:57,404
Did not want to do it.

1731
01:34:00,774 --> 01:34:01,342
Let's go.

1732
01:34:01,375 --> 01:34:02,409
We're gonna...

1733
01:34:02,443 --> 01:34:04,278
You have to stop
with the hotdogging.

1734
01:34:04,311 --> 01:34:05,412
You think there's
an outside chance

1735
01:34:05,446 --> 01:34:07,047
it was a bad call, Joe?

1736
01:34:07,081 --> 01:34:09,250
Have a seat.
Simmons in for Sweetwater.

1737
01:34:09,283 --> 01:34:09,984
-Coach--
-Don't--

1738
01:34:10,017 --> 01:34:11,285
don't even give them
a reason.

1739
01:34:11,318 --> 01:34:12,286
Don't give 'em a reason.

1740
01:34:12,319 --> 01:34:14,421
Have a seat. Thank you.

1741
01:34:14,455 --> 01:34:16,157
Simmons, get in there
for Sweetwater.

1742
01:34:16,190 --> 01:34:17,758
Let's go. Back out there.

1743
01:34:17,791 --> 01:34:19,260
- Alright, let's go.
- Keep it up,

1744
01:34:19,293 --> 01:34:20,828
don't stop moving.

1745
01:34:22,129 --> 01:34:24,765
Well, it looks like
Sweetwater's gonna be benched.

1746
01:34:24,798 --> 01:34:27,168
It's clear to
the fans here anyway,

1747
01:34:27,201 --> 01:34:28,969
that his flashy game,

1748
01:34:29,003 --> 01:34:31,805
is throwin' a curve ball
into the NBA.

1749
01:34:37,845 --> 01:34:38,679
Here we go.

1750
01:34:38,712 --> 01:34:40,881
McGuire passes to Gallatin.

1751
01:34:45,152 --> 01:34:46,220
Hook shot.

1752
01:34:46,253 --> 01:34:47,855
It's good!

1753
01:34:48,789 --> 01:34:50,858
Back on D. There we go.

1754
01:34:50,891 --> 01:34:53,127
Here come the Olympians.

1755
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:54,295
And they score again.

1756
01:35:01,936 --> 01:35:03,370
Keep it moving. Get that
rebound.

1757
01:35:03,404 --> 01:35:05,206
Vandeweghe misses the shot.

1758
01:35:05,239 --> 01:35:06,707
Back on team!

1759
01:35:16,217 --> 01:35:19,320
That my friends, marks the end
of the first half.

1760
01:35:20,555 --> 01:35:22,856
Look, okay,
let's not beat ourselves up.

1761
01:35:22,890 --> 01:35:24,425
Alright? Let-- hey!

1762
01:35:24,458 --> 01:35:26,360
Let's not get down!
Let's not get down!

1763
01:35:26,393 --> 01:35:28,462
Take a breath, everybody.

1764
01:35:28,495 --> 01:35:29,863
Fundamentals.

1765
01:35:29,897 --> 01:35:31,498
That's what wins games.

1766
01:35:31,533 --> 01:35:34,368
That's what wins
championships.

1767
01:35:34,401 --> 01:35:36,403
Alright, take a beat. Be smart.

1768
01:35:36,437 --> 01:35:37,938
Find the open man.

1769
01:35:37,972 --> 01:35:39,807
Take that extra pass,
that's alright,

1770
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:43,043
and find our rhythm
offensively.

1771
01:35:43,077 --> 01:35:45,112
That's it.
Don't get in our own way.

1772
01:35:45,145 --> 01:35:46,548
-Alright.
-Show me some fundamentals

1773
01:35:46,581 --> 01:35:48,082
out there!
Let's go guys!

1774
01:35:48,115 --> 01:35:49,049
- Let's go, Sweets.
- I know we can do this!

1775
01:35:49,083 --> 01:35:51,018
-We can do this!
-Let's go, Sweets. Come on.

1776
01:35:51,051 --> 01:35:51,852
This is the half that matters.

1777
01:35:51,885 --> 01:35:53,454
Come on,
it's a whole new ball game.

1778
01:35:53,487 --> 01:35:54,522
Let's go.

1779
01:35:56,323 --> 01:35:59,860
I get one more technical foul,
and I'm out, right?

1780
01:35:59,893 --> 01:36:00,961
Yeah, you're out.

1781
01:36:00,995 --> 01:36:02,796
That's why you're not gonna
get a technical foul.

1782
01:36:02,830 --> 01:36:04,131
You're gonna get 30 points.

1783
01:36:04,164 --> 01:36:06,000
Let's go.

1784
01:36:06,033 --> 01:36:09,169
See, when you first come to me,
you were talking about change.

1785
01:36:10,938 --> 01:36:12,940
I still believe in that.

1786
01:36:14,041 --> 01:36:17,211
Change I'm talking about,
though is changing the game.

1787
01:36:18,379 --> 01:36:21,115
You see, this ain't about the
color of my skin no more.

1788
01:36:22,316 --> 01:36:24,885
It's about what I do.

1789
01:36:26,521 --> 01:36:28,088
And how I do it.

1790
01:36:29,256 --> 01:36:32,826
It's about being true
to the game of basketball.

1791
01:36:34,328 --> 01:36:35,829
And right now,

1792
01:36:36,930 --> 01:36:39,199
you've seen it
with your own eyes.

1793
01:36:44,338 --> 01:36:46,807
My game don't belong here.

1794
01:36:51,478 --> 01:36:54,081
My game belong on the streets.

1795
01:36:55,349 --> 01:36:57,184
Not in the NBA.

1796
01:36:59,554 --> 01:37:01,288
Figures.

1797
01:37:01,322 --> 01:37:04,526
Oh, wonder if I can convince
Abe to give me my 12,500 back?

1798
01:37:04,559 --> 01:37:07,261
Oh, cut the gas!

1799
01:37:07,294 --> 01:37:09,363
12,5?

1800
01:37:11,566 --> 01:37:13,167
For my ass?

1801
01:37:17,237 --> 01:37:18,405
Damn!

1802
01:37:25,979 --> 01:37:29,183
It's uh, it's not about
the money, Sweets.

1803
01:37:30,384 --> 01:37:31,985
Never was.

1804
01:37:33,454 --> 01:37:35,856
-I'll see you on the court.
-Yeah.

1805
01:37:38,359 --> 01:37:40,361
And if you're feeling up
to breaking the scoring record,

1806
01:37:40,394 --> 01:37:42,463
we're down by 17.

1807
01:37:54,475 --> 01:37:56,343
Yeah!

1808
01:37:56,377 --> 01:37:57,378
Go!

1809
01:37:57,411 --> 01:37:59,146
Let's go!

1810
01:37:59,179 --> 01:38:02,349
Nat Clifton,
in my office.

1811
01:38:02,383 --> 01:38:03,484
Right.

1812
01:38:10,090 --> 01:38:11,559
I gotta tell you,
that that was

1813
01:38:11,593 --> 01:38:14,128
one of the most incredible
performances

1814
01:38:14,161 --> 01:38:17,331
on the basketball court
that I've ever seen.

1815
01:38:19,333 --> 01:38:21,101
As much as I loved it,

1816
01:38:22,202 --> 01:38:25,038
don't you ever do that again!

1817
01:38:26,407 --> 01:38:27,675
Huh?

1818
01:38:27,709 --> 01:38:30,545
They don't like your style.

1819
01:38:30,578 --> 01:38:33,147
Your hotdogging bigger style.

1820
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:36,083
Even though it's full of grace,
they don't like it.

1821
01:38:38,051 --> 01:38:41,388
They want you
to maybe grab a rebound,

1822
01:38:41,422 --> 01:38:42,956
block a shot or two.

1823
01:38:42,990 --> 01:38:45,092
Yes, win the game.

1824
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:49,062
But just not like
how you did it today.

1825
01:38:51,165 --> 01:38:54,067
And then
when they get off your back,

1826
01:38:55,202 --> 01:38:57,070
and let you stand up straight,

1827
01:38:59,072 --> 01:39:03,076
the world would then be able
to see what you do.

1828
01:39:06,013 --> 01:39:08,449
We're five minutes into the
second half of play, folks,

1829
01:39:08,482 --> 01:39:12,085
and there's still no sign
of Sweetwater Clifton.

1830
01:39:12,119 --> 01:39:13,688
That's beautiful.

1831
01:39:13,721 --> 01:39:15,155
Excellent!

1832
01:39:15,189 --> 01:39:17,257
And the Olympians score again!

1833
01:39:24,298 --> 01:39:27,100
Vandeweghe shoots and scores!

1834
01:39:29,470 --> 01:39:31,706
Sweetwater has finally
rejoined his team

1835
01:39:31,739 --> 01:39:33,207
on the bench.

1836
01:39:43,651 --> 01:39:46,053
Sweets, let's go.

1837
01:39:46,086 --> 01:39:47,454
Come on, here we go!

1838
01:39:51,659 --> 01:39:53,227
And Sweetwater Clifton

1839
01:39:53,260 --> 01:39:56,129
is coming back
into the game, folks.

1840
01:40:01,068 --> 01:40:03,036
Ball! Ball!

1841
01:40:08,643 --> 01:40:10,143
Yeah, get it, go.

1842
01:40:12,179 --> 01:40:13,380
Ah.

1843
01:40:19,554 --> 01:40:20,655
How do you like them apples?

1844
01:40:20,688 --> 01:40:22,256
That's why I like it.

1845
01:40:24,491 --> 01:40:27,494
Get inside, get inside
and rebound.

1846
01:40:27,529 --> 01:40:28,262
Let's go!

1847
01:40:28,295 --> 01:40:29,531
Clifton blocks the shot!

1848
01:40:29,564 --> 01:40:31,298
No!

1849
01:40:31,331 --> 01:40:33,535
Foul on number eight
on the Knicks!

1850
01:40:33,568 --> 01:40:35,168
What are you talking about?
That was the best

1851
01:40:35,202 --> 01:40:36,403
freakin' block ever.

1852
01:40:36,436 --> 01:40:37,639
Right here.

1853
01:40:37,672 --> 01:40:38,640
Inches away.

1854
01:40:40,274 --> 01:40:41,676
-Watch out.
-Alright. It's alright.

1855
01:40:41,709 --> 01:40:43,511
-Alright.
-Sweetwater Clifton

1856
01:40:43,545 --> 01:40:44,579
has just been handed

1857
01:40:44,612 --> 01:40:46,814
his fourth foul of the game.

1858
01:40:46,848 --> 01:40:50,083
One more,
and it's bye bye, Sweetwater.

1859
01:40:50,117 --> 01:40:52,352
And now Coach Lapchick
has to make the inevitable move

1860
01:40:52,386 --> 01:40:54,454
and pull Sweetwater out
of the game.

1861
01:40:55,523 --> 01:40:58,125
It's back to the bench
for Sweetwater.

1862
01:40:58,158 --> 01:40:59,326
Get that extra pass.

1863
01:40:59,359 --> 01:41:00,028
Don't back down.

1864
01:41:00,060 --> 01:41:01,596
Get that rebound. Get a rebound.

1865
01:41:01,629 --> 01:41:02,797
Another miss.

1866
01:41:02,830 --> 01:41:03,765
Get back on D, everyone.

1867
01:41:03,798 --> 01:41:05,165
Get back on D.

1868
01:41:05,198 --> 01:41:07,200
What are you doing?
Get back on D.

1869
01:41:09,336 --> 01:41:11,438
The Knicks, unable to score,
as the Olympians

1870
01:41:11,471 --> 01:41:12,574
- extend their league.
- Alright, that's it.

1871
01:41:12,607 --> 01:41:13,541
We're getting a time-out.

1872
01:41:13,575 --> 01:41:15,475
Time-out.

1873
01:41:15,510 --> 01:41:16,644
Time-out. New York.

1874
01:41:16,678 --> 01:41:18,580
There's a time-out
on the floor.

1875
01:41:18,613 --> 01:41:21,148
Don't ever give up on a play!

1876
01:41:21,181 --> 01:41:23,250
I don't know what you're doing.

1877
01:41:23,283 --> 01:41:25,620
Now-- Wh-- what happened
to our defense, okay?

1878
01:41:25,653 --> 01:41:27,855
We're gonna run some pick
and rolls from McGuire.

1879
01:41:27,889 --> 01:41:29,891
-Coach--
-Don't stop... what?

1880
01:41:29,924 --> 01:41:32,392
We're a much better team
with Sweets in there.

1881
01:41:32,426 --> 01:41:34,596
Listen, coach,
you put me on that floor,

1882
01:41:34,629 --> 01:41:36,598
all focus goes on me.

1883
01:41:36,631 --> 01:41:39,767
We can use that
to our advantage, alright?

1884
01:41:39,801 --> 01:41:42,670
-Let us take this game over!
-Alright.

1885
01:41:43,370 --> 01:41:44,171
You heard the man, let's go.

1886
01:41:44,204 --> 01:41:46,608
Come on, guys.
Let's go, let's go.

1887
01:41:55,415 --> 01:41:57,217
Hey! Vandeweghe!

1888
01:41:57,250 --> 01:41:59,754
Vandeweghe passes
to Sweetwater.

1889
01:41:59,787 --> 01:42:01,288
McGuire...

1890
01:42:01,321 --> 01:42:03,490
- Whooo!
- And score.

1891
01:42:07,662 --> 01:42:08,630
Nice, nice.

1892
01:42:08,663 --> 01:42:09,597
Get that rebound!

1893
01:42:09,631 --> 01:42:10,698
Oh!

1894
01:42:12,432 --> 01:42:13,433
Here, Vandeweghe!

1895
01:42:13,467 --> 01:42:15,335
- Clear it out!
- Give it down to Sweets.

1896
01:42:16,470 --> 01:42:18,271
To Sweets, to Sweets. Let's go.

1897
01:42:29,951 --> 01:42:30,885
- There you go.
- Sweetwater

1898
01:42:30,918 --> 01:42:32,219
grabs the rebound,

1899
01:42:32,252 --> 01:42:34,254
and makes his way down
the court.

1900
01:42:42,462 --> 01:42:44,231
Stay out of the paint.

1901
01:42:44,264 --> 01:42:45,533
Get that rebound. Yeah.

1902
01:42:45,566 --> 01:42:46,668
McGuire!

1903
01:42:46,701 --> 01:42:48,201
McGuire, back to me.

1904
01:42:48,936 --> 01:42:50,370
Vandeweghe!

1905
01:42:53,407 --> 01:42:54,709
Hey Sweets, give it here!

1906
01:42:55,977 --> 01:42:57,411
Into the mouth, there we go.

1907
01:43:04,719 --> 01:43:06,420
Alright, it's okay.

1908
01:43:12,660 --> 01:43:15,462
Yeah, it's as if
the basketball gods

1909
01:43:15,495 --> 01:43:17,565
have flipped the switch, Marty.

1910
01:43:17,598 --> 01:43:20,333
And Howard, the Olympians have
no idea how to deal with this.

1911
01:43:20,367 --> 01:43:21,669
Neither do the Refs!

1912
01:43:22,770 --> 01:43:26,473
Hey Mo, what do you think?

1913
01:43:26,507 --> 01:43:28,308
What do I think?
I think there's not

1914
01:43:28,341 --> 01:43:30,645
an empty seat
in the whole damn hall.

1915
01:43:30,678 --> 01:43:31,913
That's right.

1916
01:43:31,946 --> 01:43:34,247
We sold more tickets
than Ringling brothers.

1917
01:43:36,884 --> 01:43:38,485
Stay with it. Focus up.

1918
01:43:40,888 --> 01:43:42,623
Aah!

1919
01:43:42,657 --> 01:43:44,025
Sweetwater goes down.

1920
01:43:44,058 --> 01:43:45,459
Look at that.

1921
01:43:45,492 --> 01:43:47,260
What'd you say to me? Huh?

1922
01:43:48,328 --> 01:43:49,797
Foul, foul.

1923
01:43:52,867 --> 01:43:56,369
We've got a full-scale fight
right on the floor.

1924
01:43:56,403 --> 01:43:57,337
It's okay, it's okay.

1925
01:43:57,370 --> 01:43:59,339
Just scared of you.
It's okay, it's okay.

1926
01:43:59,372 --> 01:44:01,274
-That boy...
-He's just scared of you.

1927
01:44:01,308 --> 01:44:02,877
It's alright, it's okay.

1928
01:44:02,910 --> 01:44:04,011
That ain't basketball!

1929
01:44:04,045 --> 01:44:07,481
-You don't know basketball!
-Joe, Joe.

1930
01:44:07,515 --> 01:44:09,382
Hey, hey, hey, it's nothing.
I got this.

1931
01:44:14,055 --> 01:44:17,058
This is a crucial moment
in the ball game.

1932
01:44:17,091 --> 01:44:21,261
If it goes the other way,
Clifton is out.

1933
01:44:29,369 --> 01:44:31,773
Alright, we got a personal foul.

1934
01:44:31,806 --> 01:44:33,574
A number 11 on the Knicks.

1935
01:44:33,608 --> 01:44:34,208
The foul was on Gallatin.

1936
01:44:34,242 --> 01:44:35,308
Two shot Blue.

1937
01:44:35,342 --> 01:44:36,944
It's gonna be number 11.

1938
01:44:36,978 --> 01:44:39,446
It's not gonna go
on Sweetwater Clifton.

1939
01:44:39,479 --> 01:44:41,082
He will stay in the ball game.

1940
01:44:41,115 --> 01:44:43,518
The Knicks just dodged
a huge bullet right there.

1941
01:44:43,551 --> 01:44:45,887
Let's go, let's go.

1942
01:44:52,459 --> 01:44:54,662
Now we got two shots.

1943
01:44:54,695 --> 01:44:57,832
Oh, don't you miss.

1944
01:44:57,865 --> 01:44:59,399
It's free.

1945
01:45:05,807 --> 01:45:07,575
Oh.

1946
01:45:10,978 --> 01:45:12,513
I just need one more.

1947
01:45:18,152 --> 01:45:20,087
And the Knicks have the ball.

1948
01:45:20,121 --> 01:45:21,421
Hey, Vandeweghe!

1949
01:45:21,454 --> 01:45:22,824
Vandeweghe into Sweetwater.

1950
01:45:22,857 --> 01:45:24,025
He's looking around.

1951
01:45:24,058 --> 01:45:26,027
He's gonna take the ball
himself.

1952
01:45:27,862 --> 01:45:29,462
The basket's good.

1953
01:45:29,496 --> 01:45:32,700
I got a foul on 15 Blue.

1954
01:45:32,733 --> 01:45:34,401
You got one shot.

1955
01:45:34,434 --> 01:45:36,436
Out of this world, what a game.

1956
01:45:36,469 --> 01:45:37,972
This one's for the books,
Howard.

1957
01:45:38,005 --> 01:45:39,439
Seconds to play,

1958
01:45:39,472 --> 01:45:41,876
and we've got ourselves
a barn burner, Marty.

1959
01:45:47,882 --> 01:45:49,416
Here's the free throw.

1960
01:45:52,753 --> 01:45:53,888
Yes!

1961
01:45:58,826 --> 01:45:59,760
Switch, switch, switch.

1962
01:45:59,794 --> 01:46:02,997
The Olympians attempting
a hotdog.

1963
01:46:03,030 --> 01:46:05,032
And Sweetwater steals the ball.

1964
01:46:05,066 --> 01:46:06,167
Time-out. Time-out. Time-out.

1965
01:46:08,135 --> 01:46:09,469
Come on, come on.

1966
01:46:10,605 --> 01:46:12,439
There's a time-out on the floor.

1967
01:46:12,472 --> 01:46:13,406
What are the Knicks gonna
do now?

1968
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:15,910
We're talking about just
a few seconds left.

1969
01:46:15,943 --> 01:46:17,545
Strategy is everything
right now.

1970
01:46:17,578 --> 01:46:18,779
Here's what I want you to do.

1971
01:46:18,813 --> 01:46:20,882
I want you to give it
to the truth,

1972
01:46:20,915 --> 01:46:22,083
at the top of the key.

1973
01:46:22,116 --> 01:46:23,084
Alright?

1974
01:46:23,117 --> 01:46:25,019
And then you're gonna clear
out of the way.

1975
01:46:25,052 --> 01:46:26,520
Give it to him.
Come on, let's go.

1976
01:46:26,554 --> 01:46:27,889
Alright, we got 10 seconds.

1977
01:46:27,922 --> 01:46:28,990
Let's do it!

1978
01:46:29,023 --> 01:46:30,157
10 seconds!

1979
01:46:30,191 --> 01:46:32,159
Let's go, Knicks. Let's go.

1980
01:46:32,193 --> 01:46:33,661
And the Knicks have the ball.

1981
01:46:39,499 --> 01:46:40,902
Sweetwater at the top
of the key.

1982
01:46:40,935 --> 01:46:42,536
Nine seconds left.

1983
01:46:43,905 --> 01:46:48,075
9, 8, 7, 6,

1984
01:46:48,109 --> 01:46:51,846
5, 4, 3,

1985
01:46:51,879 --> 01:46:53,781
2, 1.

1986
01:46:56,951 --> 01:46:58,920
The Knicks have won the game.

1987
01:46:58,953 --> 01:47:02,455
72-71, the final score.

1988
01:47:02,489 --> 01:47:03,691
What a finish, folks!

1989
01:47:15,770 --> 01:47:17,571
Sweetwater! Sweetwater!

1990
01:47:17,605 --> 01:47:19,206
Sweetwater! Sweetwater!

1991
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:21,075
Sweetwater! Sweetwater!

1992
01:47:21,108 --> 01:47:22,944
Sweetwater! Sweetwater!

1993
01:47:22,977 --> 01:47:24,845
Sweetwater! Sweetwater!

1994
01:48:11,158 --> 01:48:12,727
Great game, Sweetwater.

1995
01:48:14,862 --> 01:48:16,030
Thank you.

1996
01:48:17,131 --> 01:48:19,066
Goodnight.

1997
01:48:19,100 --> 01:48:20,634
Goodnight.

1998
01:48:28,943 --> 01:48:30,111
I can't believe this.

1999
01:48:32,313 --> 01:48:34,115
I'm sitting here riding
in a cab

2000
01:48:34,148 --> 01:48:38,119
with the Nat Sweetwater Clifton.

2001
01:48:42,289 --> 01:48:43,824
People don't know, man.

2002
01:48:45,693 --> 01:48:47,628
They don't know that when
they're watching an NBA game,

2003
01:48:47,661 --> 01:48:49,330
they're watching you
play your game,

2004
01:48:49,363 --> 01:48:51,265
they're watching Sweetwater.

2005
01:48:51,298 --> 01:48:52,967
You lit that torch.

2006
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,703
No, uh, it ain't like that.

2007
01:48:55,736 --> 01:48:56,804
I uh...

2008
01:48:58,172 --> 01:49:00,741
I'm a small part of it all.

2009
01:49:02,176 --> 01:49:03,744
Just a messenger.

2010
01:49:06,614 --> 01:49:08,082
You definitely delivered.

2011
01:49:09,750 --> 01:49:10,951
Big time.

2012
01:49:13,087 --> 01:49:14,121
Thank you.

2013
01:49:15,823 --> 01:49:17,658
I rather enjoyed the ride.

2014
01:49:19,293 --> 01:49:20,828
Me too.
