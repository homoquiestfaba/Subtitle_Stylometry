1
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,291
I'd love to get back
to Chicago if that's possible.

2
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:41,291
Or actually, any big city
would be great.

3
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,333
You know, which is why
I decided to call you.

4
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:44,834
I really want to get back to it.

5
00:00:44,917 --> 00:00:49,000
I, um, am not exactly thrilled,
Fred, with my position presently.

6
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,917
Looking at your file,
we have plenty of good news.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,375
There is always a shortage of
good trial lawyers. Always. Um...

8
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,417
You were recruited
right out of law school

9
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,601
by Richter, Sanford and Nichols.

10
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,875
I was. They're one of
the top firms, as you know.

11
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:03,834
Mm-hmm. You left 18 months ago.

12
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:06,583
Looks like they gave
you quite a load.

13
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:08,208
They sure did.

14
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:09,601
They were certainly
grooming you for something.

15
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:11,000
Was it too much for you?

16
00:01:11,083 --> 00:01:12,875
No. No, not at all.

17
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,542
You know, I like that kind of excitement,
and, uh, I miss it. Yeah.

18
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:19,875
Then why on Earth would you leave
such a prestigious law firm, Mr. Durrell?

19
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:22,917
I mean, why abandon
such a promising career?

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,083
Well, "abandon" is a...

21
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:27,000
Calvin, what are you doing?

22
00:01:29,792 --> 00:01:32,583
You gotta stay here, Cal.
Can you sit here for me?

23
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:34,917
Just stay here for a second.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,583
I'm coming, Mooney.

25
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:12,125
I'm coming.

26
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:16,542
I'm coming.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,875
Coming, Mooney.

28
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:25,875
You're squishy.

29
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,750
Buenos días, Poncho Pinella.

30
00:02:40,834 --> 00:02:41,959
Are you getting up?

31
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,458
Hey, come here a second,
will you, please? Come here.

32
00:02:44,542 --> 00:02:47,834
What happened to you? Where'd
you go? Why are you all wet?

33
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,834
You're soaked. Look at you.
With mud and everything.

34
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:53,625
Calvin, look at you
and Mr. Flatso.

35
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:56,333
You got Mr. Flatso soaked. So?

36
00:02:56,417 --> 00:02:59,208
"So"? I could wring you out.

37
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:03,667
But I was just getting Mooney.

38
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,125
Mooney? Boy, she's
a long way from home.

39
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:09,041
Where's old Mooney now?
She's okay.

40
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,417
Where's okay, Cal?

41
00:03:12,417 --> 00:03:14,333
Drying with the clothes.

42
00:03:14,417 --> 00:03:17,583
Not okay. Not okay, Calvin.

43
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:22,875
Calvin, you're gonna
kill the damn cat.

44
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,667
Calvin!

45
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,166
Calvin, where is she?
Where'd you put Mooney?

46
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,083
Where'd you put
the neighbor's cat, Calvin?

47
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:39,125
In the bag,
Calvin? You don't put Mooney in the bag.

48
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,709
Okay.

49
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,333
You're fun this morning, aren't you,
Cal? Is that what it's gonna be like?

50
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:51,709
Mooney,
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:51,792 --> 00:03:54,000
Okay, ready to go under? Uh-huh.

52
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,959
Here we go.

53
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,125
That's good, Cal.

54
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,667
Uh-huh.

55
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,375
Can you make the motorboat?

56
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,542
I don't want to wear
my long pants.

57
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,917
Just step into these, will you,
please? I don't wanna.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,917
Come on. We're gonna be
late this morning.

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,041
I don't want to wear
my long pants.

60
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,845
Cal, listen, you gotta wear 'em,
okay? It's gonna be too cold not to.

61
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,417
I don't wanna wear...
Please don't do it to me.

62
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,375
Hey, buddy, let's go. I'm late.

63
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:27,750
Come on, Cal.

64
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,083
Okay. Come on. Let's go.

65
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:33,709
And one last time.
From way out, one-handed.
No, not close.

66
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:35,917
That's all right. Let's go.

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,709
I wasn't trying.
You know that, right?
I could have made that.

68
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:40,667
Here we go.

69
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:49,792
All right, move with me,
will you, buddy?

70
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:53,333
We're running late. Come on.

71
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:57,583
What, you don't want
the jacket? Take it off.
Take it off.

72
00:04:57,667 --> 00:04:59,500
Hey, Charlotte,
how you doing?
Hey, guys...

73
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:02,250
I'm sorry we're late,
but you got my numbers.
If there's anything...

74
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:05,351
I have to tell you, honey,
I tried to get a hold of you,
but she's got the bug...

75
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,851
Megan, upstairs. I don't want
him to catch it, so I'm not
gonna be able to take him today.

76
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:10,226
Oh, Charlotte,
this comes at a very bad time.

77
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,210
I have a meeting I'm supposed
to be at, like, now.

78
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,518
I have to go meet
with these people.
You'd be doing me a big favor.

79
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:15,893
You're gonna have no favor

80
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:17,142
if he comes down
with what she's got.

81
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,750
Meg was picking her nose.

82
00:05:19,834 --> 00:05:22,667
Oh, gross. Really?
I've never seen you do that.

83
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,875
I do it a couple of times.

84
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:33,291
Take your seat belt off, Cal.
Come on. Let's go.

85
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,542
Let me get my things.

86
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:37,542
Okay.

87
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,166
Come on, Cal. Let's go.
Can you move?

88
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,375
We gotta move this morning.
Let's go. Come on.

89
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,500
Let's go.

90
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:52,166
Come here a second.
Listen to me. Come here.

91
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,458
Now, we're gonna be good
in there today, right?

92
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:57,959
Okay. No messing around?

93
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,625
Okay.

94
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:02,351
Okay. And I want you to be
Mr. Invisible. Can you be
invisible for me today?

95
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,291
Mr. Invisible.
Okay, Mr. Invisible.

96
00:06:06,542 --> 00:06:08,667
Come on, buddy.
I'm sorry, but we're late.
Can you...

97
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,375
Come on. Okay. Good.

98
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,500
Now, remember,
you're invisible, right?
Hi, Russ.

99
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,667
Morning, Blanche.
How are you?
Hi, Cal.

100
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,250
Okay, come on.

101
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,101
Find out what
your take is on the case...

102
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:23,208
Okay. You're invisible.
You're invisible.
Go, go, go. Good.

103
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:26,709
Could you excuse me
just one second? Russ?

104
00:06:26,792 --> 00:06:30,000
Russ? Excuse me. Just a second.

105
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,709
Russ?

106
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:34,226
Hey, how are you, Bob?
Good morning to you, man.
What's the deal?

107
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,309
Good to see ya.
What do you mean?

108
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,935
You know what I mean.
Is Calvin here again today?

109
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:39,041
Just for part of it. Yeah.
Oh, man.

110
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,542
All right, listen.
I got Councilman Thomas
in here.

111
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,434
What do you mean you got
Councilman Thomas in there?

112
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,893
I'm the one... I got
an appointment with him, Bob.

113
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:47,041
I'm the one
that brought him in here.
Come on.

114
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,250
Come on.

115
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,750
Look, I want you to take
the Joyce Ives case.

116
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:54,667
Are you serious?
You took that woman's
deposition. She's insane.

117
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,250
You just passed the bar
in this state. There's time
to work your way up, buddy.

118
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,625
Okay, buddy. I was this close
to being a junior partner
back in Chicago.

119
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:04,125
I happen to specialize
in cases like Thomas's.

120
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,125
This isn't Chicago, right?

121
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,917
This isn't, uh,
Mr. Fancy-Pants law firm.

122
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,291
I mean, for Christ's sakes,
you came to me
looking for a position,

123
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,625
and this is what it is.

124
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:18,125
Take the goddamn
Joyce Ives case.

125
00:07:24,834 --> 00:07:26,917
Yeah, look at that. Wow.

126
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,834
Yeah, wow. Come on.
Let's go inside, Cal.

127
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,917
Spaghetti Bolognese
is the special today.

128
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
No. Actually, uh,
I didn't come here for food.

129
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:39,417
I wanted to ask you
how long have you known
Larry Ives, Carol?

130
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,875
Do you mean biblically?

131
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:43,792
No.

132
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,834
Listen, I'm gonna
go get Frankie, okay?

133
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:47,834
No, actually, Carol...
No, don't get Frankie.

134
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:49,834
Don't get Frankie.
I came to talk
to you, Carol.

135
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:54,625
I wanted to talk to you, Carol.

136
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:56,625
Jesus.

137
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:57,625
What's that?

138
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:59,333
It's a postcard.

139
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:00,667
Well, duh.

140
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,375
It's for you.
Here. Investigate it.

141
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:07,959
I can't read it.
That's the thing.

142
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,458
I mean, she writes it to you

143
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:12,959
like I'm not gonna have to
sit down and read through it.

144
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,083
Who's it from? MAN: There he is.

145
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:18,250
From your mom.
How you doing there,
little fella?

146
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,458
How are ya?
Good to see you, Frankie.

147
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,166
Is this true what I hear
that you took over
the case from Harper?

148
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,667
Mm-hmm. It sure is.
- What's it say?

149
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,000
I thought I'd done all
my talking with lawyers
and all that. No?

150
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,166
There's some sort
of mix-up here.

151
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,333
- I'm here actually to...
- What's it say?

152
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:34,834
Calvin, sit tight.
What's it say?

153
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:36,476
I'm here to speak with Carol,
not to speak with you.

154
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,166
Can you believe...
Calvin, keep the card
out of my face, please.

155
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,834
Can you sit still?
Stop putting the card
in my face, please.

156
00:08:42,917 --> 00:08:45,041
Stop putting the card
in my face, please.

157
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,500
I'm trying to talk to somebody.

158
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:48,959
Stop putting the card
in my face.

159
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:56,000
Now you made him mad.
Maybe he wants something to eat.

160
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:58,000
No, he's fine.
He had something
to eat, Frankie.

161
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:00,393
Listen, if I could
talk to Carol for just
a couple minutes...

162
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:07,083
What a fruitcake.
Your client, not Carol.
Oh, my.

163
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,709
She's a fruitcake?
On this particular day,

164
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:13,375
Larry, he's a-sitting
in his usual spot...
I really should...

165
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:14,658
by the window. It's all right.

166
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:18,041
Then along come Carol.
She come walking over as usual.

167
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:21,500
See, they got this attraction
for each other. Can't keep
their hands off each other.

168
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,583
Carol's the one
I want to talk to.

169
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:26,542
It's disgusting.
So I'm watching this,
and I'm looking up.

170
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:29,625
Who do you suppose
I see sittin' over there
in the gas station?

171
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,667
The nutcase wife
of Larry's, your client.

172
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:38,166
And she's moving
and suddenly...
she just took off.

173
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,250
And she's heading
right straight for the side
of my goddamn restaurant!

174
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:46,083
I look up, and the whole wall
come right down on the front end
of her Dodge.

175
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:49,125
She come walking
in the door here all calm...
Mm-hmm.

176
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,125
Hands him the keys and says...

177
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,875
You can drive it home...

178
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,458
when you come
to get your things.

179
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:58,417
And then she's gone.
That's it. Gone.

180
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,417
And Larry's standing there
like an idiot.

181
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,458
Like a rube.

182
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,750
And now she's suing me?
That's beautiful.

183
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:09,750
Russ, you're a nice guy,

184
00:10:09,834 --> 00:10:11,917
but I feel so sorry for you.

185
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,208
You're a long way
from the big city here, boy.

186
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,583
I got a lot of customers here.

187
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:21,083
Yeah, you're very busy.
Congratulations on
the pickup in business.

188
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,166
At least that's
happened for you.

189
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,709
What you doing?

190
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:35,458
What's this animal?
That one there?

191
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:37,792
That's a Calvin monkey.
That's a very rare monkey.

192
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,583
That's a Calvin monkey.

193
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:43,250
You want to read it?

194
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,792
Hmm?

195
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,917
Okay.

196
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,125
"Dear..."
What's that word there?

197
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,125
Calvin? Mm-hmm.

198
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,750
That's good. "Dear Calvin,

199
00:10:55,834 --> 00:10:58,333
I've been missing you
so badly it hurts.

200
00:10:58,417 --> 00:11:02,792
Could I come see you,
and love you, and hold you?

201
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:03,917
Mom."

202
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,375
What's she look like?

203
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,333
Hey, you ready to go?

204
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:16,208
What do you say
we get out of here?
Okay.

205
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:18,709
Okay. That's good.

206
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:26,041
Oh, my gosh.
This is to Calvin Durrell

207
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,000
from Grandpa Durrell.

208
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,500
It's very exciting,
isn't it? You excited?
Mm-hmm. Yep.

209
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,959
Here, you help me
get this stuff here.

210
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:34,518
This is your stuff.
We'll pull all this out.

211
00:11:34,542 --> 00:11:36,709
Oh, look,
there's a note here too.

212
00:11:36,792 --> 00:11:39,000
There you go. That's yours.

213
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,542
Wow, look at that thing.
What the heck is that?

214
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:47,333
See what the note says here.

215
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:51,709
"Dear Calvin, enclosed
please find one Portuguese
man-of-war

216
00:11:51,792 --> 00:11:54,875
captured after great struggle
off Key Biscayne."

217
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,542
That's this here. See?

218
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:59,667
Portuguese man-of-war.

219
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,417
"Many adventures to be
had here in Florida.

220
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,250
Tell your old man
to pack your gear
and ship you down

221
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,750
so you can keep
your grandpa
and Joanie company.

222
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:10,875
Love, Grandpa."

223
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,792
See that? "Love, Grandpa."

224
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,250
I don't want to move.

225
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,250
You like it here, huh?

226
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,792
Mm-hmm.

227
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,542
A box jellyfish is
kind of like a man-of-war,

228
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,583
but only it stings worse.

229
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:37,709
It stings you, huh? Mm-hmm.

230
00:12:37,792 --> 00:12:40,250
It's pretty cool Grandpa
sent you the man-of-war.
Yep.

231
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,917
He always sends
you nice stuff.
Yep.

232
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:47,250
I tell you what, Cal,
I think we're wasting
our time here.

233
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,542
I think this thing's
already dead.
Keep punching.

234
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:54,917
Yeah, I'm punching.
I'm punching it.
Look at me. See?

235
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,750
See how I do it?
What do you feed it,
do you suppose?

236
00:12:58,834 --> 00:13:01,875
Um, it's dead, Calvin.

237
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:04,041
I don't think you gotta
feed it anything.

238
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,333
I think it's dead.

239
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:12,250
- Hello.
- Russell?

240
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,458
Kate. How are you?

241
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:22,333
I know it's kind of late.
I was nervous about calling.

242
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:25,458
Yeah, well, uh,
Calvin's already asleep.

243
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:27,458
I thought maybe
I could catch him.

244
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:29,458
No, I had to put him
to bed early.

245
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,125
He caught, uh, some sort of
bug from his friend Meg.

246
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:33,750
He's got friends?

247
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:35,792
Of course
he's got friends, Kate.

248
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,458
I... I only meant I didn't know.

249
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:40,302
I mean, they grow a lot
in a year and a half.

250
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,959
Really? Did you, uh,
read that somewhere?

251
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:46,291
Don't start on me, okay?
I just wanted to talk to him.

252
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:49,125
Uh-huh, you call
every couple months,

253
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,959
and I guess you
feel fine after that.

254
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,125
I'm his mother.

255
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,583
Wait, wait, wait.
You're his what?

256
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,542
You're his what?

257
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,959
I'm the one who's with
him every day, Kate.

258
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,458
I feed him. I tie his shoes.

259
00:14:01,542 --> 00:14:03,333
I make him lunch.
I put him to bed.

260
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:05,375
Okay. All right.

261
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,333
I didn't call to have you
lecture me again. Okay.

262
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:09,709
Okay.

263
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:17,959
Okay, here with
a little sauce.

264
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,166
We go here with a little sauce.

265
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,333
That's good.

266
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:25,500
Right, let's get
this nice and mixed.

267
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,166
Nothing like
a little spaghetti, right?

268
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,458
Looking good.

269
00:14:30,542 --> 00:14:34,041
Now we go with a little
bit of the seasoning.

270
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,875
Yeah, you always
like the seasoning.

271
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,917
There you go.

272
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:46,166
Who were you talking to?

273
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,208
On the phone?

274
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:49,291
Your mom.

275
00:14:50,792 --> 00:14:53,000
Where is she?

276
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,500
I don't know, Cal.

277
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,458
Come on.
Eat your spaghetti now
while it's still hot.

278
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:05,166
That's what I want
to name my man-of-war.

279
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,208
What's that? Mom.

280
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:12,000
You mean you wanna name your...
Name it after Kate?

281
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,083
You want to call
your man-of-war Kate?

282
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,250
No. Mom.

283
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,643
All right, come on, Peter.
Look alive.

284
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:26,458
Look alive, Peter. Be with him.

285
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,208
Hey, Peter. Peter,
what are you doing, man?

286
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:37,643
I went
for the block out.
Never give your man
a shot like that.

287
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:39,875
When the guy goes up,
what do you do?
Just keep my feet.

288
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:41,792
Keep your feet.
Keep your feet.
Stay with him.

289
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,375
Good try. Stay with him.

290
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:51,875
You're late again, Noah.
What's the deal?

291
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:55,291
I, uh... I had somewhat
of a girl problem.

292
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,834
You know that's five times
in the last two weeks?

293
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:07,458
Hey, Peter, you're gonna start
Friday night for Noah here.

294
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:10,000
Whoa! Whoa!
What are you talking about?

295
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:11,792
You can't put him in for me.

296
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,959
Why not? At least I know
he'll be here at tip-off.

297
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,017
Why not? 'Cause you're
not even the fucking coach!
That's why not!

298
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,625
I'm the coach
until Miller gets back,

299
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:20,291
and if you use that word
one more time
in front of my son,

300
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,125
I'll give him your uniform too.

301
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,000
Yeah? Mm-hmm.

302
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:28,375
Jerk. Shit. Asshole.

303
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:34,291
All right, guys. Let's go.
Let's play some basketball here.
Ball in.

304
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:37,959
Look alive. Let's go.

305
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:41,184
Hold it. Calvin, what the hell
are you doing? I told you to
stay off the damn court.

306
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,166
It's okay, Coach.
We saw him.
He's not okay.

307
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,667
Put me down!
Don't scream at me like that.

308
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,333
Put me down!

309
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:49,375
Put me down!

310
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,625
Put me down!

311
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:53,667
Calvin, you stay here now,
do you hear me?

312
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,166
Don't come back
on that court again. All right?

313
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,125
Stay here.

314
00:16:59,917 --> 00:17:01,959
Stay there.

315
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:31,625
How you been, Cal? You okay?

316
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:38,959
Calvin, you can't draw
on the windshield.
Who said you could...

317
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,375
Asshole. You guys
really piss me off.

318
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,417
You just...
You come in here.
You take over.

319
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,540
Are you nuts? You just scared
the crap outta my kid,

320
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:52,166
then you tear into me as if
I assaulted you with dog food?

321
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,750
Oh, shit!

322
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:57,267
Yeah, you scared
the hell out of him.

323
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:00,709
I'm sorry, sweetie.
It's just dog food.
I didn't mean to scare you.

324
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:02,542
Argus, get off!

325
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,917
God, you're not, uh,
Joyce Ives, are you?

326
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,917
You had no right to take
Noah out of the game on Friday.

327
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,583
Are you his lawyer?
No, I'm his sister.

328
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:11,351
Well, I don't know what
Noah told you, sister,

329
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:13,959
but he's late
half the time to practice,
and I called him on it.

330
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,417
So, then he told me
to go "F" myself
in front of my kid here.

331
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,458
Then he had a temper tantrum
and threw his shoes
across the gymnasium.

332
00:18:19,542 --> 00:18:23,208
But I see overreacting to
situations is something that
might just run in the family.

333
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:25,250
So, what, he has to apologize?

334
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:27,500
Well until he does,
he's off the team.

335
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,250
Yeah.

336
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,792
Well, he's been going
through a lot lately.

337
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,250
He's got
this new girlfriend,
and I'm not sure,

338
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,166
but I think
it's his first real
sexual adventure.

339
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:45,250
Listen, I'm sorry
about the dog food.

340
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,834
That's all right.
Maybe we can salvage it
for Argus.

341
00:18:47,917 --> 00:18:51,625
No, no. Maybe I can make it up
to you, to your little boy.
What's his name?

342
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:54,000
Uh, his name is Calvin.

343
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:57,500
Hey, Calvin.
I'm sorry I scared you.

344
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,667
That's okay.

345
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,291
You like horses? Uh-huh.

346
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,500
You do?
Would you like
to ride a horse?

347
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,625
You really have a horse?

348
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:10,667
Yes, yes. I really have a horse.

349
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,542
You know what though?
We should probably
ask your dad first, huh?

350
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:17,083
Would that be all right?
If we went and...

351
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,583
You know what?
Can we just start over?

352
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:21,750
Hi, I'm Beth.

353
00:19:21,834 --> 00:19:24,291
Beth, I'm Russ.
Nice to meet you.

354
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,458
Yeah.

355
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:29,583
You okay, buddy?

356
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,834
Hi, Dad! Hi.

357
00:19:58,917 --> 00:20:01,208
Can you get him up here?

358
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,375
There you go.

359
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,875
So, is this your place?

360
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:12,875
No, I wish.

361
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:15,542
This is just where I stable.

362
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:17,333
Maybe someday.

363
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,083
Watch your feet, Calvin.

364
00:20:23,792 --> 00:20:26,375
I live in a trailer.

365
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:30,166
That was my big prize
when I got divorced.

366
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,083
How long were you married?

367
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,434
A little over three years,

368
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,917
but it was pretty much over
before the rice hit the ground.

369
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
How about you? Is it official?

370
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,792
No. Uh...

371
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:49,667
Technically,
I don't really know
what's going on.

372
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,875
I mean, she doesn't
live with us or anything.

373
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,375
But you're separated?

374
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,709
Yeah.

375
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:58,250
I guess.

376
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,875
By several states.

377
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:04,083
Hey, Dad, are you gonna
ride the horse next time?
Maybe.

378
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,208
Maybe I'll get on that horse.

379
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,208
I actually know some things
about you, you know.

380
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,875
More than you think.

381
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:23,875
Calvin, you're, uh...
You're gonna slip.

382
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:26,917
It's gonna slip
right out of there.
Keep that up higher there.

383
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,041
How? From your brother?
From Noah?
Him and others.

384
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,709
It's a small town.

385
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:34,518
Calvin, you're slipping
with your hamburger. Be careful.
You're gonna drop it.

386
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:36,792
What kind of things?
Are they good?

387
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,435
You want me to
cut that for you, cowboy?

388
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,625
Okay. How about
the plate, Calvin?

389
00:21:43,709 --> 00:21:47,125
It's not just for looks.
The plate there.

390
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:49,959
You're supposed to eat
over the plate. Come here.

391
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:54,625
Look at you. Oh, my God.
That's great. That's great.
That's great.

392
00:21:54,709 --> 00:21:55,976
I think we're gonna have
to take you in

393
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,280
and hose you off
in the bathroom.

394
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,709
I can go.

395
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,041
The bathroom's there.

396
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:12,083
He's, uh...

397
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:15,750
just a little
embarrassed,
you know.

398
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,959
I heard she just left
you and Calvin.

399
00:22:23,792 --> 00:22:26,583
Yeah. Basically.

400
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:33,208
I, um, had
to cut back
from work,

401
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:36,500
because, uh, you know,
I had to spend more time
with him.

402
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,667
At least put him to bed
and stuff like that.

403
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,542
So... they fired me.

404
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:44,386
And then I ended up having
all the time in the world
to spend with him.

405
00:22:44,458 --> 00:22:47,500
So what brought you
down here?
I needed a job.

406
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:50,000
A guy that I went to,
uh, college with...

407
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:53,542
is the guy that
I actually work for, with,
or whatever the hell it is.

408
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:56,250
But, uh, we were
roommates in school.

409
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:01,750
Do you want to go out?

410
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:08,208
Go out? You mean,
like, on a date?

411
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:09,750
Yeah.

412
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,583
Yeah.

413
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:15,709
Yeah, I'd like that.

414
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:19,208
Okay. Okay.

415
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:22,041
We should, uh...
We should think of
something to do though,

416
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:23,709
because there's not a lot.

417
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:24,875
Aw, damn it.

418
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:26,709
What?

419
00:23:26,792 --> 00:23:28,667
I don't have
a babysitter for Cal.

420
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,875
She's, uh,
in Kansas City right now.

421
00:23:30,959 --> 00:23:33,375
Well, you could
come over to my house.

422
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:36,208
We could have dinner,
watch cartoons.

423
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:40,333
Right, or you could come
to our house, 'cause I gotta
put him to bed sometime.

424
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:43,875
Do you smell something? Hmm?

425
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:46,041
Kind of like pee?

426
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,750
Yeah, come to think of it, I do.

427
00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:55,750
Calvin, come here.
Let me see you a second.
Come here. Come here, buddy.

428
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,750
Did you wet your pants?

429
00:23:57,834 --> 00:23:59,417
No.

430
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,250
Well, what's this
then all over you?

431
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:03,875
A urinal cake?

432
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:05,000
Oh, my God.

433
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:06,685
Why do you have
a urinal cake on you?

434
00:24:06,709 --> 00:24:09,083
It was in there,
and we don't have one.

435
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:12,583
You know what, sweetie,
I don't have one in
my bathroom either.

436
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:14,792
Do you want this one?
No. She doesn't.

437
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:17,000
No, thank you.

438
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:31,500
It's too loud.
I gotta turn it down.

439
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:32,917
Did I wake you up?

440
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,375
I should really try
to be more responsible
about that sort of thing.

441
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:39,166
Whoo!

442
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,083
Joyce, listen, uh,

443
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:25,286
for this thing
to go on any further
than it already has

444
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:28,208
won't do anybody involved
any good at all, especially me.

445
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:31,041
Correct me
if I'm wrong here, Russell,
but you're my lawyer.

446
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:32,959
You're supposed to please me.

447
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:36,750
Joyce, you cannot
sue these people.

448
00:26:36,834 --> 00:26:39,125
You have no case
against these people,

449
00:26:39,208 --> 00:26:42,083
and you're lucky, frankly,
that they're not pressing
charges against you.

450
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:45,959
It was their waitress.

451
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:48,792
Bill, we need a ball
returned on lane seven.

452
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:50,917
Lane seven, ball return.

453
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,583
I've got you out
to a number of firms,

454
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:56,917
and let me tell you,
a good percentage are
showing some interest.

455
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,309
Yeah, that's great.
Great, great, great.

456
00:26:58,333 --> 00:26:59,917
So do they want
to interview me or what?

457
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,083
I've gotta get you
a face-to-face
with these people.

458
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:03,375
It's looking very good though.

459
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:05,083
Right. Okay.

460
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,709
If you can just hang in there.

461
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,208
Yeah, I'm hanging in here.

462
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:11,291
Just, uh, please let me know
when, uh, ever you hear
anything at all.

463
00:27:11,375 --> 00:27:13,792
Yeah. Okay.
Okay. Thanks a lot. Bye.

464
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:15,041
Damn it.

465
00:27:17,834 --> 00:27:20,166
No. Stick with it.

466
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:37,291
I'm, uh, supposed
to say that I'm sorry
for, you know, what I said.

467
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:39,542
How about once more
with feeling, Noah?

468
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:45,917
I'm sorry for...

469
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,500
you know, everything I said
in front of your kid
and the team and...

470
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:52,959
You know, I'm... I'm sorry.

471
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:55,583
So, is that enough,
or do you want him
on his hands and knees?

472
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:58,542
Hands and knees.

473
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,125
Come on.

474
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:05,333
All right, clean slate.

475
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,559
All right. Now suit up,
and we'll see you
out there, okay?

476
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:08,750
Thanks, Coach.

477
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:14,041
He's lucky to have you.
Thank you.

478
00:28:46,417 --> 00:28:47,583
Hi there. Hi.

479
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:48,875
How are you? Good.

480
00:28:48,959 --> 00:28:51,208
Yeah? Pretty good game,
isn't it?
Yep.

481
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:52,542
Your daddy's doing a good job.

482
00:28:53,542 --> 00:28:56,208
It's not supposed
to be a foul, ref.

483
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:57,917
Call it down there then.

484
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,166
Let the kids play
the game a little bit.

485
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:10,250
Get in position, Noah.
Get in position.

486
00:29:16,834 --> 00:29:18,625
All right! All right.

487
00:29:23,792 --> 00:29:25,750
Hi-yah!

488
00:29:25,834 --> 00:29:27,667
Chi-ka-ka-ka koo-aah.

489
00:29:31,542 --> 00:29:33,709
Okay, your turn, Admiral.

490
00:29:33,792 --> 00:29:35,709
I don't want
to play anymore.
Don't be that girl.

491
00:29:35,792 --> 00:29:38,250
Don't be the girl
that wants to play
a third time in a row,

492
00:29:38,333 --> 00:29:42,041
talks me into it,
and now doesn't want
to play anymore.

493
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:44,917
You're tied.
You're finally tied.
This is your shot. Let's go.

494
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,917
I got a good feeling
for you this time.
Do you?

495
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,959
I-1.
I don't know why.

496
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:50,875
I-1. You won.

497
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:52,959
No. I-1. I-1.

498
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,250
Hit.

499
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:58,041
Hit. Okay?
See how much fun
we can have?

500
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:01,667
This is a really great date.

501
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,458
Let's go. I got you. Good.

502
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:11,625
What are you doing?

503
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:14,291
It's just a couple of plates.

504
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,583
I'll get the plates later.
I can clean up.

505
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:21,542
It's okay.

506
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:38,834
I should put him upstairs.

507
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:40,792
Okay.

508
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:04,208
Good night, buddy.

509
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:43,333
Is he asleep?

510
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:45,709
What?

511
00:31:45,792 --> 00:31:49,500
Is he asleep? Yes, he's asleep.

512
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,959
Oh, my. She may see us.

513
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:31,226
We had better go
into camo-... camo-...

514
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,490
Uh, stealth mode.

515
00:33:33,542 --> 00:33:35,625
Does your dad let you
answer the phone?

516
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:39,458
Russ.

517
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:50,291
Hello. Durrell residence.

518
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:53,667
Um, hi, who's this?

519
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,125
Beth.

520
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:58,291
Yeah. Uh, are you
the babysitter?

521
00:33:58,375 --> 00:34:00,667
Uh-huh. May I ask who's calling?

522
00:34:09,834 --> 00:34:11,750
Yeah, all right.

523
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,041
Uh!

524
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:36,667
Calvin, will you tell
your dad I had to go?

525
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:41,041
Okay,
I'll see you later.
Bye.

526
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:56,125
How?

527
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:58,583
- All right, you guys.
- What's goin' on?

528
00:34:58,667 --> 00:35:01,125
You gotta help us.

529
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:03,583
- Yeah. Help.
- We're in big trouble.

530
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:05,142
Calm down, you two.

531
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:06,166
Where is she?

532
00:35:20,834 --> 00:35:23,250
Although this is
a fascinating story,

533
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:26,542
I feel I must draw
your attention
to a more...

534
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,545
Why'd she leave, Calvin?
What did you say to her?

535
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:30,333
I didn't say anything.

536
00:35:30,417 --> 00:35:32,625
Then why did she leave
the house, Calvin?

537
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:33,875
I don't know.

538
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:35,518
Did you say something that
could have hurt her feelings?

539
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:37,125
We were just playing.

540
00:35:37,208 --> 00:35:39,709
Are you not
telling me something?

541
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,709
Calvin, come here right now!

542
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,125
Come here.
Did you do this?
Is this your mess?

543
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:56,458
Yes. Is it?

544
00:35:56,542 --> 00:35:58,625
So-... Why's it sitting there?

545
00:35:58,709 --> 00:35:59,583
Sorry.

546
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:01,227
Don't be sorry.
Clean the damn thing up.

547
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:05,291
Clean up the orange juice,
Calvin. Clean it up.

548
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:08,417
Take the napkins
and clean up the orange juice.

549
00:36:14,125 --> 00:36:16,333
You take everything
for granted, don't you?

550
00:36:16,417 --> 00:36:18,500
What about that fish thing, huh?

551
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:21,542
Did you ever thank
your grandpa for that?
Hm-mmm.

552
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:23,545
You know what?
I'm gonna throw
the damn thing out.

553
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:26,333
It's starting to stink up
the whole house.
No! Let go!

554
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:28,685
Why should I keep it, huh?
You don't appreciate it.
Let go!

555
00:36:28,709 --> 00:36:30,125
Don't scream at me. Let go!

556
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:31,542
Look at me.

557
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:34,375
Don't you dare hit me again.
Don't you hit me again.

558
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:36,208
You're fired.

559
00:36:53,625 --> 00:36:55,125
Hey, Cal.

560
00:36:56,583 --> 00:36:59,041
You can keep it.

561
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:01,291
I overreacted, buddy.

562
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:05,959
I'm sorry, Cal.

563
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,041
Cal, if you want to talk,
I'm downstairs, all right?

564
00:37:14,125 --> 00:37:16,375
I'm sorry.

565
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:20,250
Hey, Cal, now's your chance.
You hear that? She's back.

566
00:37:26,917 --> 00:37:28,250
Hi.

567
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:31,041
What the hell
are you doing here?

568
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:33,875
I, um...
I didn't think
you'd be here.

569
00:37:33,959 --> 00:37:35,959
The babysitter said that
you were working today.

570
00:37:36,041 --> 00:37:38,041
So then you just show up
at my house?

571
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:40,041
Well, I guess this girl
didn't tell you.
Kate.

572
00:37:41,834 --> 00:37:43,959
What are you talking about?

573
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:46,643
I called you.
When? Did I ever say you could
show up here at my house?

574
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:48,250
Just before I did.

575
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,041
Hi, Cal.

576
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:58,834
How's my little man, huh?

577
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,125
I, um...
I brought him something.

578
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:08,625
I wasn't sure
what you'd like,
so I...

579
00:38:08,709 --> 00:38:10,667
took some time...

580
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:25,458
What did you expect?

581
00:38:25,542 --> 00:38:28,166
Hmm?

582
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:30,490
Look, do me a favor
and get out of here,
will you, please?

583
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:32,622
He's not just gonna come
running back into your arms.

584
00:38:32,667 --> 00:38:35,083
Yeah, I'm sure after what
you've said about me too,
Russ, huh?

585
00:38:35,166 --> 00:38:38,500
You haven't seen your son
in 18 months.

586
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:41,458
What the hell do I possibly
have to say to him?

587
00:38:41,542 --> 00:38:43,375
I want to see him.

588
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:47,250
Well,

589
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:49,959
obviously, he, uh,
doesn't want to see you.

590
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:51,750
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

591
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:10,166
What are you drawing,
buddy?
Turtle.

592
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,834
It's good. Thanks.

593
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:18,834
Your mom's still here,
and she's got
that gift for you.

594
00:39:18,917 --> 00:39:21,375
She wants to give it to you.

595
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:23,291
How do you feel about that?

596
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:28,375
You feel okay?

597
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:32,000
Hey, hey, hey.

598
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:34,625
You don't have
to do anything.
Are you sure?

599
00:39:34,709 --> 00:39:36,250
Sure.

600
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:48,458
Come on in.

601
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:56,917
Hi, peanut. Hi.

602
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,875
I brought you something.

603
00:40:00,959 --> 00:40:03,709
Is that for me?
Yep, it's for you.

604
00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:07,667
Can I help you open it?

605
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,917
It's kind of hard
to get at this bow, huh?

606
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,542
You like the paper?

607
00:40:12,625 --> 00:40:13,959
Yeah?

608
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,750
It's a little toy
that you hook up to the hose,

609
00:40:20,834 --> 00:40:23,583
and then
this little beaver sort of...
or gopher, or something...

610
00:40:23,667 --> 00:40:27,542
sort of pops out
and splashes you with water
when you're not looking.

611
00:40:28,667 --> 00:40:29,875
Do you like it?

612
00:40:29,959 --> 00:40:31,250
Mm-hmm. Yeah?

613
00:40:33,667 --> 00:40:37,125
Do you want to go outside
and play with it right now,
or no?

614
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:38,333
Can we?

615
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:42,083
Mm-hmm.

616
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:44,125
Okay.

617
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:54,375
Whoo!

618
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:57,709
Ready? Want to creep up on him?

619
00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:15,125
- Keep doing it.
- Keep doing it.

620
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:49,041
"And they were all,
each one, happy beyond words.

621
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:51,083
The end."

622
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:55,375
That's kind of nice, huh?

623
00:41:57,917 --> 00:42:00,333
Hey, um...

624
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:03,583
thank you so much
for letting me spend
the day with you.

625
00:42:05,417 --> 00:42:06,959
You're welcome.

626
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:09,542
You should get some sleep,
huh? It's late.

627
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:11,375
Can I have Mr. Flatso?

628
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:12,709
What?

629
00:42:12,792 --> 00:42:15,667
Can I have Mr. Flatso?

630
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:18,667
Pillow? Mm-hmm.

631
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:21,166
Mr. Flatso.

632
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:24,583
Let's get you
tucked in nice and cozy.

633
00:42:34,667 --> 00:42:36,625
Come here.

634
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:43,500
Thank you
for the clothes,
by the way.

635
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:45,542
I didn't think
I'd get that dirty.

636
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:48,083
It was kind of fun though.

637
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:51,333
So, can I come see him tomorrow?

638
00:42:51,417 --> 00:42:53,667
Yeah, but what's your
plan with everything?

639
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:55,375
Well, I don't know.
I'm staying in town.

640
00:42:55,458 --> 00:42:57,375
I'd like to see him
as much as possible

641
00:42:57,458 --> 00:42:58,875
if that's all right with you.
Right.

642
00:42:58,959 --> 00:43:03,375
You know,
see how it goes and...
Yeah.

643
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:06,917
But, um, did you think
that, you know...
And I don't know, Kate.

644
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,417
But you just kind of
would sail back in town,

645
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,250
and then everything
would be okay?

646
00:43:12,333 --> 00:43:14,250
I know that
I messed up, Russ.
I know that.

647
00:43:14,333 --> 00:43:16,625
No, I do.

648
00:43:16,709 --> 00:43:19,709
I wouldn't expect you
to understand what I was
going through then though.

649
00:43:19,792 --> 00:43:22,375
I don't understand, Kate.

650
00:43:24,625 --> 00:43:26,500
I don't.

651
00:43:29,667 --> 00:43:33,709
But I don't know
if you understand
what Calvin went through.

652
00:43:33,792 --> 00:43:36,417
You know, when you left,
he used to worry all the time

653
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,291
about, you know,
"When's Mom coming back home?"

654
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,917
Then he would, you know, worry,

655
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,041
"Does Mom love me?
Does Mom love me anymore?"

656
00:43:52,542 --> 00:43:54,583
Well, thank you for telling me.

657
00:44:50,083 --> 00:44:51,351
Hi. You've reached Beth.

658
00:44:51,375 --> 00:44:53,125
Please leave a message
after the beep.

659
00:44:54,875 --> 00:44:57,834
Hey, Beth, it's, uh,
Russ calling you,

660
00:44:57,917 --> 00:45:02,542
and I just want to say
that I had a really, uh,
great time, uh, last night,

661
00:45:02,625 --> 00:45:05,875
and, uh, I know that you...

662
00:45:05,959 --> 00:45:10,500
had a run-in
or, you know, whatever
on the phone with Kate,

663
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:14,875
and I just wanted you
to know that that is just
a complete surprise...

664
00:45:14,959 --> 00:45:18,041
and just very weird
and, uh, you know,

665
00:45:18,125 --> 00:45:21,041
nothing at all you need
to concern yourself about.

666
00:45:21,125 --> 00:45:23,083
So, anyway, um,

667
00:45:23,166 --> 00:45:25,208
I would love to see you again,

668
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:28,667
so I will give you a call, um,

669
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:31,750
tomorrow or later or, uh,

670
00:45:31,834 --> 00:45:34,250
whenever, okay?

671
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:37,333
I'll talk to you soon hopefully.

672
00:45:37,417 --> 00:45:39,083
Good night.

673
00:45:45,291 --> 00:45:48,542
Hey, Beth, it's, uh,
Russ calling you,

674
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:52,709
and I just want to say
that I had a really, uh,
great time, uh, last night.

675
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:55,417
- Good job in the first half.
- He's six of nine.

676
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,959
They get the open shots,
they gotta knock 'em down.

677
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,792
Beth?

678
00:46:21,208 --> 00:46:22,667
Hello?

679
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:26,250
Hey.

680
00:46:26,333 --> 00:46:28,208
What are you doing here?

681
00:46:28,291 --> 00:46:30,959
I just stopped by
to see if, uh...

682
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:33,083
to see if Beth, Beth was around.

683
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:35,083
What for?

684
00:46:35,166 --> 00:46:37,458
Nothing about you, Noah.
Just to talk to her.

685
00:46:37,542 --> 00:46:40,125
Are you all right back there?
Yeah.

686
00:46:40,208 --> 00:46:42,417
Yeah. She's, um...
She's at work.

687
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:46,250
She's a vet's assistant
down in Ozawkie, so...

688
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:48,291
Uh, this is Bonnie. Hi.

689
00:46:48,375 --> 00:46:49,625
It's her birthday today.

690
00:46:49,709 --> 00:46:51,166
Happy birthday to you.

691
00:46:52,542 --> 00:46:54,291
She, uh...

692
00:46:56,667 --> 00:46:58,291
She hit 17 today.

693
00:46:58,375 --> 00:47:00,834
That's great. Seventeen.
It's a big year.

694
00:47:00,917 --> 00:47:02,333
Good stuff to come.

695
00:47:02,417 --> 00:47:05,291
I'm older than my mother
was when she had me.

696
00:47:05,375 --> 00:47:08,583
That's great. I have a...
Myself, I have a preschooler.

697
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:15,875
Right, okay.
Nice to meet you, Bonnie.

698
00:47:17,291 --> 00:47:19,375
And, uh, happy birthday to you.

699
00:47:19,458 --> 00:47:21,750
Have a good day.

700
00:47:28,417 --> 00:47:31,959
Hey, uh, you're not
gonna tell Beth?

701
00:47:32,041 --> 00:47:33,917
Tell her what?

702
00:47:36,458 --> 00:47:40,458
So, uh, what
do you think of Bonnie?

703
00:47:40,542 --> 00:47:43,834
The girl in there?
Yeah, real nice.
She seems real nice.

704
00:47:43,917 --> 00:47:46,667
Like a nice, uh...
You know, real likable.

705
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:48,625
Like a real likable girl.
Easy to like.

706
00:47:48,709 --> 00:47:51,333
She's a nice girl. Yeah.

707
00:47:51,417 --> 00:47:54,000
All right, Noah.
All right, man.
Take it easy.

708
00:47:54,083 --> 00:47:56,583
Yeah. We'll see you later.

709
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,041
Good boy.

710
00:48:04,417 --> 00:48:05,917
All right. Hold him here.

711
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,500
That's a boy. Hold still.
Good boy. Good boy.

712
00:48:11,083 --> 00:48:12,166
That's it.

713
00:48:13,792 --> 00:48:16,500
You know, you didn't have
to leave in such a hurry.

714
00:48:16,583 --> 00:48:18,834
Yeah, well, your wife
sort of forced the issue.

715
00:48:18,917 --> 00:48:21,959
Yeah. She can be
real thoughtful that way.

716
00:48:24,291 --> 00:48:27,208
Do you still have
feelings for her?

717
00:48:27,291 --> 00:48:29,333
What?

718
00:48:29,417 --> 00:48:31,417
You're still wearing
your wedding ring.

719
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,041
No, the only real connection
I have with her anymore
is Calvin,

720
00:48:34,125 --> 00:48:36,834
and even that
is, uh, you know,
pretty shaky.

721
00:48:36,917 --> 00:48:40,625
She must want something,
though, by coming back.

722
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:44,208
Yeah, you know,
I doubt she even
knows why she left.

723
00:48:44,291 --> 00:48:47,750
We never talked about it.
She went to go help
with her sister's wedding,

724
00:48:47,834 --> 00:48:50,709
and then the fiancé ditched.

725
00:48:50,792 --> 00:48:54,083
So she ended up staying
to be with her sister.

726
00:48:54,166 --> 00:48:55,792
Was that true?

727
00:48:55,875 --> 00:48:58,875
I guess so, but,
you know, the week
she was supposed to be gone

728
00:48:58,959 --> 00:49:00,917
turned into three weeks,
then six weeks,

729
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,834
then she just stopped calling
for months at a time.

730
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,792
Why didn't you just go get her?

731
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,583
No. No.

732
00:49:23,208 --> 00:49:26,959
Ow, ow, ow, ow! Ouch.

733
00:49:27,041 --> 00:49:29,083
Did I hurt you? Did I hurt you?

734
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:31,417
My leg, it's cramping. Ow, ow!

735
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,792
Oh, your leg's... Okay.

736
00:49:38,834 --> 00:49:40,792
Is it okay? Yeah.

737
00:49:40,875 --> 00:49:43,667
You all right?

738
00:49:57,875 --> 00:49:59,959
I was gonna call you tomorrow.

739
00:50:00,041 --> 00:50:02,291
But I can see this is going
nowhere fast.

740
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:03,792
Absolutely nowhere.

741
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:06,500
I mean, maybe... Maybe...

742
00:50:06,583 --> 00:50:08,542
It's a sensitive matter.

743
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:17,792
I'll see you later. Okay.

744
00:50:29,417 --> 00:50:32,625
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

745
00:50:32,709 --> 00:50:36,208
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoo!

746
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:39,166
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

747
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:41,333
See, you can't do that.

748
00:50:41,417 --> 00:50:44,709
Oh, yeah?
Well, you can't do this.

749
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:47,250
Now you see it.

750
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:49,792
Now you don't.

751
00:50:55,291 --> 00:50:57,208
So how was your day, buddy?

752
00:50:57,291 --> 00:50:59,083
Okay.

753
00:50:59,166 --> 00:51:02,333
Did anything interesting happen?

754
00:51:02,417 --> 00:51:04,917
Hmm, no.

755
00:51:31,667 --> 00:51:33,458
Hi, buddy. CALVIN: Hi.

756
00:51:33,542 --> 00:51:35,917
Want to play? Yep.

757
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,125
No? You want to do it?
All by yourself?

758
00:51:40,208 --> 00:51:43,291
Hi. Hi.

759
00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:46,041
Ahh, that was a good one.

760
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:49,417
I brought your shirt
back and your clothes.

761
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:52,208
Thanks again.

762
00:51:52,291 --> 00:51:55,583
Another shot? Mm-hmm.

763
00:51:55,667 --> 00:51:58,625
You want me to hold you up
this time? Here you go.

764
00:51:58,709 --> 00:52:00,875
I'm a little, tiny mouse.

765
00:52:00,959 --> 00:52:04,041
There you go.
Go get it.

766
00:52:05,834 --> 00:52:07,750
Okay.

767
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:10,417
Come on, Dad. Play.

768
00:52:21,166 --> 00:52:23,959
Can we try one? Yep.

769
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:26,208
You lifting me up?

770
00:52:29,208 --> 00:52:31,000
Yay! Good shot, Cal.

771
00:52:31,083 --> 00:52:32,542
There you go.

772
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,917
Get it. Get it.

773
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,625
Oh! Come on.
Gimme. Gimme. Gimme.

774
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,333
Come on. Gimme.

775
00:52:44,417 --> 00:52:46,375
Come on. Gimme.

776
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:51,959
"Portu..."

777
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:57,208
That's sick. That reeks.

778
00:52:57,291 --> 00:52:58,959
Yeah. So?

779
00:52:59,041 --> 00:53:02,041
So we might have to
give your man-of-war a,

780
00:53:02,125 --> 00:53:04,500
a, uh, a burial, Calvin.

781
00:53:04,583 --> 00:53:07,625
You know, like, maybe
flush it down the toilet,
give it a burial.

782
00:53:07,709 --> 00:53:08,875
No!

783
00:53:08,959 --> 00:53:10,291
Do you like the smell?

784
00:53:10,375 --> 00:53:12,500
I can fix it. You can fix it?

785
00:53:14,375 --> 00:53:16,333
It's got legs. It does.

786
00:53:16,417 --> 00:53:18,667
It's got... Yeah.
A lot of things.

787
00:53:18,750 --> 00:53:20,291
But, Calvin, see here
how it's pretty

788
00:53:20,375 --> 00:53:22,685
when you draw it,
and then you look
at it in the jar,
and it's not?

789
00:53:22,709 --> 00:53:25,625
You better not
throw it out
while I'm gone.

790
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:34,291
The whole bottle
of aftershave, Cal?
Is that necessary?

791
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:38,917
See? It doesn't
stink bad anymore.

792
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,750
See? Smell.

793
00:53:43,667 --> 00:53:47,542
Mmm. Smells like a rose.

794
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:49,750
- That's great.
- Do you really think

795
00:53:49,834 --> 00:53:51,417
that's gonna do it, Cal?

796
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:54,083
Yep. That's doing it. Yep.

797
00:53:54,166 --> 00:53:56,542
You should probably put
the cap back on though, huh?

798
00:53:56,625 --> 00:53:58,834
So it stays nice and warm. Yeah.

799
00:53:58,917 --> 00:54:00,750
He's cold. Tight too.

800
00:54:00,834 --> 00:54:03,834
There you go. He's all set, huh?

801
00:54:03,917 --> 00:54:05,750
What did you name him?

802
00:54:07,792 --> 00:54:09,750
Mom.

803
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Just like your name.

804
00:54:27,166 --> 00:54:29,750
Me and Dad take showers.

805
00:54:29,834 --> 00:54:32,417
You do? Wow.
You're a big guy, huh?

806
00:54:33,959 --> 00:54:35,810
Is this okay, though,
that you're taking a bath?

807
00:54:35,834 --> 00:54:37,875
Yep. This is good.

808
00:54:37,959 --> 00:54:40,458
This is kind of like swimming.

809
00:54:40,542 --> 00:54:43,041
Hi. Hi.

810
00:54:43,125 --> 00:54:45,917
I just thought
I'd get him started for you.

811
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,750
Right.

812
00:54:47,834 --> 00:54:49,125
Hey, buddy. Hi.

813
00:54:49,208 --> 00:54:50,750
How you doing? Good.

814
00:54:50,834 --> 00:54:52,208
Can you see
anything interesting?

815
00:54:52,291 --> 00:54:54,208
God. Do you remember
when we had him?

816
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:57,417
He was so tiny, you know.

817
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,291
A little peanut.

818
00:54:59,375 --> 00:55:03,583
I remember that night, you...

819
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:06,041
You fell asleep
in the recovery room, and...

820
00:55:07,917 --> 00:55:10,959
you rolled off the bed,
and you cracked
your chin wide open.

821
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:13,166
Get your teeth brushed.

822
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:16,333
Yeah, that's a face.

823
00:55:16,417 --> 00:55:18,250
You feel clean? Mm-hmm.

824
00:55:18,333 --> 00:55:20,250
Do you? Good.

825
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:22,291
What do you want
to read tonight, huh?

826
00:55:22,375 --> 00:55:23,500
Moog-Moog, Space Barber.

827
00:55:23,583 --> 00:55:25,583
Moog-Moog, Space Barber, it is.

828
00:55:25,667 --> 00:55:27,375
Come on, Space Barber.

829
00:55:33,709 --> 00:55:35,792
"Well, I bet you can't do this."

830
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:37,041
What does she do?

831
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:39,166
Takes the hand,
in the pocket,
pulls out a nickel.

832
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:41,709
Right? Takes the nickel.

833
00:55:41,792 --> 00:55:43,625
And she puts it up in...

834
00:55:43,709 --> 00:55:45,875
And goes like that.

835
00:55:45,959 --> 00:55:47,166
No.

836
00:56:47,792 --> 00:56:49,709
Are...

837
00:56:49,792 --> 00:56:51,250
Are you seeing anybody?

838
00:56:51,333 --> 00:56:53,750
Yeah, I, uh...

839
00:56:55,291 --> 00:56:57,959
just started to see somebody.

840
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:01,750
How about you?

841
00:57:01,834 --> 00:57:04,542
Um...

842
00:57:04,625 --> 00:57:07,792
Sort of between relationships.

843
00:57:12,834 --> 00:57:14,709
Good night.

844
00:57:23,166 --> 00:57:25,542
Bye. Bye.

845
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,500
You drive this thing
to work, Larry?

846
00:57:38,834 --> 00:57:40,792
She's driving my Camaro.

847
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:44,291
Uh-huh. How'd she work that out?

848
00:57:44,375 --> 00:57:46,458
I don't know.

849
00:57:46,542 --> 00:57:48,583
How are the brakes
on this thing?

850
00:57:48,667 --> 00:57:51,291
Wasn't anything with
the brakes, Mr. Durrell.

851
00:57:51,375 --> 00:57:53,625
She just damn drove
through the wall.

852
00:57:53,709 --> 00:57:56,208
Mm-hmm. And do you know
why she did that?

853
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,625
I know you know why too.

854
00:58:00,709 --> 00:58:03,917
From my understanding,
it's because you were seeing
one of the waitresses there.

855
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,500
A Miss, uh, Carol Holman,
I believe is her name.

856
00:58:10,583 --> 00:58:13,208
It wasn't like I set out
on screwing around.

857
00:58:16,583 --> 00:58:20,166
Me and Joyce was happy.
We still are.

858
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:22,959
Sort of.

859
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:25,667
Kind of.

860
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:27,583
Oh, man.

861
00:58:29,125 --> 00:58:33,333
I used to think she was
all there was for me.

862
00:58:33,417 --> 00:58:35,750
Now, I feel
that way about Carol!

863
00:58:39,542 --> 00:58:43,875
It's not about there
being one perfect match
for somebody.

864
00:58:43,959 --> 00:58:47,375
I just happened to run
across two in my lifetime,

865
00:58:47,458 --> 00:58:49,041
two at the same time.

866
00:58:54,291 --> 00:58:57,792
Come on, Shaw.
You let him walk right in.
Come on, guys. Block out.

867
00:59:03,875 --> 00:59:06,500
Cut to the ball, Noah.
Cut to the ball.

868
00:59:08,458 --> 00:59:09,625
Move! Move!

869
00:59:19,625 --> 00:59:22,250
Come on, guys.
Let's take it in.
Take it in.

870
00:59:22,333 --> 00:59:25,875
Good game. Good game.
Good game, man.

871
00:59:25,959 --> 00:59:28,291
It's like his fifth year
in high school.

872
00:59:32,291 --> 00:59:34,375
Well, that sucked.

873
00:59:34,458 --> 00:59:36,542
Yeah, it was
a close one, huh?
Mm-hmm.

874
00:59:36,625 --> 00:59:38,875
Why you looking at me like that?

875
00:59:38,959 --> 00:59:40,125
Like what?

876
00:59:40,208 --> 00:59:44,041
Like the way you're looking
at me, right now, like, why?

877
00:59:44,125 --> 00:59:47,583
Noah, it's...
It's just a game.

878
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:48,834
Noah.

879
00:59:51,291 --> 00:59:53,542
This was not the game
to come to, huh?

880
00:59:53,625 --> 00:59:55,792
Hey, how are you?

881
00:59:55,875 --> 00:59:57,142
How you doing?
Sorry about that.
Good to see you.

882
00:59:57,166 --> 00:59:59,458
That's all right.
Connie, how are you?

883
00:59:59,542 --> 01:00:03,458
Hey. Oh, well as expected
when you're expecting, right?
Uh-huh. Right.

884
01:00:03,542 --> 01:00:05,291
Where's Calvin?

885
01:00:05,375 --> 01:00:09,125
Calvin is with his,
with Kate, actually.

886
01:00:09,208 --> 01:00:11,709
God, I hope you two
can work things out.

887
01:00:15,041 --> 01:00:17,291
Hi. I'm Connie Harper.

888
01:00:17,375 --> 01:00:19,208
Hi. Beth.

889
01:00:19,291 --> 01:00:23,542
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yes, Beth Ward, this is, uh,
as you met, Connie Harper.

890
01:00:23,625 --> 01:00:26,291
And this is,
uh, Bob Harper,
her better half.

891
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:27,417
Hi. How are you?

892
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:31,625
Beth is, uh, one
of the players' sisters
on the team.

893
01:00:31,709 --> 01:00:33,792
Oh, great. Uh-huh. Yeah.

894
01:00:33,875 --> 01:00:37,375
And, uh, also a, uh,
a friend of mine.

895
01:01:19,125 --> 01:01:21,333
- Hello?
- Mr. Russell Durrell, please.

896
01:01:21,417 --> 01:01:22,792
Yeah, speaking.

897
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:24,792
This is Deputy
Sheriff Pritchard.

898
01:01:28,709 --> 01:01:31,291
By law, I should lock him up.

899
01:01:31,375 --> 01:01:33,458
But everyone involved's okay?

900
01:01:33,542 --> 01:01:35,875
They're fine,
but the boy's
severely intoxicated.

901
01:01:35,959 --> 01:01:38,291
He's also underage.

902
01:01:38,375 --> 01:01:42,041
Except she was driving.
She claims she was
trying to avoid a deer.

903
01:01:42,125 --> 01:01:44,417
Now, she appears
to be sober to me.

904
01:01:45,917 --> 01:01:48,500
The boy wouldn't let me
call his family.

905
01:01:48,583 --> 01:01:51,000
He says he's, uh...
You're his basketball coach.

906
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:53,542
I am.

907
01:01:53,625 --> 01:01:57,291
Listen, why don't you get
him the hell out of here?

908
01:02:00,583 --> 01:02:03,083
Okay, Noah, you all right?

909
01:02:03,166 --> 01:02:06,083
Come on, partner.
Watch your head here.
Come on.

910
01:02:06,166 --> 01:02:09,542
You're okay.
Come on, Noah.
Almost inside.

911
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:13,041
You're all right.
You're all right.

912
01:02:13,125 --> 01:02:16,208
Okay? Here we go.

913
01:02:16,291 --> 01:02:19,959
We're at the door. Okay.

914
01:02:23,417 --> 01:02:24,959
Here we go. There you are.

915
01:02:33,417 --> 01:02:34,625
Hi.

916
01:02:39,542 --> 01:02:41,667
You just got out of gym class?

917
01:02:43,667 --> 01:02:47,083
No, it, it got hot, so...

918
01:02:47,166 --> 01:02:50,792
Um, don't worry, though.
I'll take off if you want.

919
01:02:50,875 --> 01:02:54,083
You don't have to do that.
You can sleep in my bed,

920
01:02:54,166 --> 01:02:56,792
and I'll just sleep downstairs.

921
01:02:56,875 --> 01:02:58,750
You sure?

922
01:02:58,834 --> 01:03:00,458
Mm-hmm.

923
01:03:00,542 --> 01:03:02,458
Thanks.

924
01:03:06,166 --> 01:03:08,458
I have to pee.

925
01:03:10,667 --> 01:03:13,834
Let me get out of your way.
Sure. It's all yours.

926
01:04:13,625 --> 01:04:16,709
You want a towel? Yeah.

927
01:04:20,792 --> 01:04:22,625
Thanks.

928
01:04:28,375 --> 01:04:30,917
You know, you've done
a great job with Cal.

929
01:05:22,709 --> 01:05:24,542
I missed you.

930
01:05:26,834 --> 01:05:29,792
God, I missed you so much, Kate.

931
01:05:33,041 --> 01:05:34,875
What's wrong?

932
01:05:36,667 --> 01:05:40,166
I, um... I have to
tell you something.

933
01:05:44,375 --> 01:05:47,834
I, um... I met... I met
someone when I was away.

934
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,750
And, um...

935
01:05:53,834 --> 01:05:56,291
I fell in love with him, Russ.

936
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,083
Why are you
telling me this
right now?

937
01:06:08,166 --> 01:06:11,750
Because I told myself
that I was in love with you.
You know I did.

938
01:06:11,834 --> 01:06:14,959
Hey, hey, hey.

939
01:06:15,041 --> 01:06:16,291
We were in love.

940
01:06:16,375 --> 01:06:18,542
No, Russ.

941
01:06:20,542 --> 01:06:23,375
You were. You were.

942
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,041
And I loved that.
I loved that so much. I did.

943
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:43,417
But I don't think that I ever
really loved you, you know?

944
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,917
Okay, Mom. Okay.

945
01:08:52,083 --> 01:08:53,625
Hi. Hi.

946
01:08:53,709 --> 01:08:56,291
Is Noah here?
Yeah. He's, uh,
right here on the couch.

947
01:08:56,375 --> 01:08:57,667
I am so sorry.

948
01:08:57,750 --> 01:09:00,166
My mom didn't even know
he was missing
until this morning.

949
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:03,583
Yeah, well, the cops called me,
and I just, you know,
went and picked him up.

950
01:09:03,667 --> 01:09:06,291
He is so good at pulling
other people into his shit.

951
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:09,583
Yeah. He's gonna be hard
to get up. He's like...
Hey, Russ.

952
01:09:09,667 --> 01:09:11,851
Dead on the couch.
Just a second, Kate, please.
Can I have a second?

953
01:09:11,875 --> 01:09:14,125
Yeah, well, your son,
he needs you now.

954
01:09:14,208 --> 01:09:16,417
Well, you're his mom, right?
Can't you deal with it?

955
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:19,041
Yeah, I tried,
but his arm's stuck
in the toilet.

956
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:22,041
I'll just be a second.

957
01:09:24,417 --> 01:09:25,976
How'd his arm get stuck
in the toilet?

958
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,476
I have no idea.
He was looking for something.
How am I supposed to know?

959
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,184
You're supposed
to be watching him.
I was watching him, Russ.

960
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:32,250
What do you want me to do?

961
01:09:36,083 --> 01:09:37,667
Russ, please be careful. Please.

962
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:40,667
One, two... Russ, watch his arm.

963
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:42,959
Three! There you go.
There you go.

964
01:09:43,041 --> 01:09:46,000
Okay, shush, shush,
shush, shush, shush.
You're okay. You're okay.

965
01:09:46,083 --> 01:09:49,166
You were just in the toilet.
You're okay. You're okay.
You're okay.

966
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:52,959
Shh, shh, shh. Calvin, shush.

967
01:09:53,041 --> 01:09:56,500
What's going on
with you and toilets?
You threw my man-of-war out!

968
01:09:56,583 --> 01:09:58,267
Is that what you were doing?
Were you looking
for your man-of-war?

969
01:09:58,291 --> 01:09:59,583
Yes!

970
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:02,500
Calvin, we had a talk
about the man-of-war.
Do you remember that?

971
01:10:02,583 --> 01:10:05,875
I told you it was
starting to smell.
You threw it out!

972
01:10:05,959 --> 01:10:09,291
Listen to me. Get up,
all right? Just wake up.

973
01:10:09,375 --> 01:10:10,559
Stop screaming!

974
01:10:10,583 --> 01:10:12,267
I told you it was starting
to smell up the whole house.

975
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:15,875
It wasn't smelly!
I fixed it!
No, you didn't fix it!

976
01:10:15,959 --> 01:10:18,041
Why did you throw
that thing away?

977
01:10:18,125 --> 01:10:19,476
You weren't living
with the smell for two weeks,
Kate.

978
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:21,017
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

979
01:10:21,041 --> 01:10:23,768
Well, maybe you could have
had a burial or something.
It was a jellyfish!

980
01:10:23,792 --> 01:10:26,750
Beth, could you wait
a second, please?
I wanna talk to you.

981
01:10:26,834 --> 01:10:28,875
Beth! Oh, you're Beth.
You're the babysitter, Beth.

982
01:10:28,959 --> 01:10:31,542
No, she's not
the babysitter, Kate.
She's my girlfriend.

983
01:10:31,625 --> 01:10:34,000
That's stretching it, isn't it?

984
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:39,875
Beth, hold on.
Wait a second, please.

985
01:10:39,959 --> 01:10:41,709
I don't wanna be
in the middle of this.

986
01:10:41,792 --> 01:10:43,643
Look, it's over between us.
We're getting a divorce.

987
01:10:43,667 --> 01:10:45,834
Did you sleep with her?

988
01:10:45,917 --> 01:10:49,458
Things just got complicated
with this is all, you know?

989
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:57,959
Look, I knew that you had
shit going on in your life,
all right? We all do.

990
01:10:58,041 --> 01:11:00,917
But you led me to believe
you had made up your mind.

991
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,709
I have made up my mind.

992
01:11:05,542 --> 01:11:08,917
That's good. That's real good.

993
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,166
So have I.

994
01:11:22,875 --> 01:11:24,417
Thanks.

995
01:11:26,333 --> 01:11:29,083
See you later, man.
See you later.

996
01:12:20,375 --> 01:12:22,166
Hey.

997
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:24,208
I'm all right.

998
01:12:27,208 --> 01:12:29,625
I'm sorry I made you sad.

999
01:12:29,709 --> 01:12:32,083
You didn't make me sad, Cal.

1000
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:36,750
No, I'm just having
a bad day, that's all.

1001
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:42,250
You know, being a dad
can be hard sometimes.

1002
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:47,000
I just don't know
if I'm doing a good job of it.

1003
01:12:47,083 --> 01:12:49,208
You're doing good.

1004
01:12:49,291 --> 01:12:52,458
Yeah? I'm glad
one of us thinks so.

1005
01:12:56,125 --> 01:12:57,959
I think so.

1006
01:13:05,166 --> 01:13:08,041
I'm sorry I threw out
your man-of-war, buddy.

1007
01:13:08,125 --> 01:13:10,000
Yeah, me too.

1008
01:13:32,583 --> 01:13:35,208
Hello?
Hey, Russ.
It's Tom Johnson.

1009
01:13:35,291 --> 01:13:37,375
Hey, Tom. How are you, man?

1010
01:13:37,458 --> 01:13:40,000
Where are you?
I heard you left Chicago.

1011
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:42,291
Yeah. I'm down in Dallas now.

1012
01:13:42,375 --> 01:13:44,709
Newbauer, Whitman, and Johnson.

1013
01:13:44,792 --> 01:13:46,583
Hey, congratulations, partner.

1014
01:13:46,667 --> 01:13:48,542
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1015
01:13:48,625 --> 01:13:51,583
So, Russ, listen,
this morning,
I came into my office,

1016
01:13:51,667 --> 01:13:54,709
and I found that my secretary
had dropped your resume
on my desk.

1017
01:13:54,792 --> 01:13:57,875
What do you think?
You really feel like you're
ready to get out there again?

1018
01:13:57,959 --> 01:14:00,291
Oh, absolutely, man.
I'd love to get back out there.

1019
01:14:00,375 --> 01:14:03,615
Excellent. 'Cause I wanna
fly you down here
as soon as possible
to meet my partners.

1020
01:14:03,667 --> 01:14:04,667
How's that sound?

1021
01:14:04,709 --> 01:14:05,851
It sounds great.
It sounds great.

1022
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:07,643
I got a few things on my plate
I'd have to rearrange,

1023
01:14:07,667 --> 01:14:09,542
but that shouldn't
be a problem at all.

1024
01:14:09,625 --> 01:14:11,518
You wouldn't believe
this backwards case
I'm working on,

1025
01:14:11,542 --> 01:14:14,417
but I'm there, Tom.
I'm absolutely there, man.
And thank you.

1026
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:16,417
Okay. See you soon.
Okay, I'll see you soon.

1027
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,875
Bye, Russ. Thanks for calling.

1028
01:14:46,417 --> 01:14:48,875
So what do you say, buddy?
You want some crayons?

1029
01:14:56,709 --> 01:14:58,417
Calvin?

1030
01:14:59,375 --> 01:15:01,375
Cal, where you at, buddy?

1031
01:15:05,041 --> 01:15:06,184
Calvin, what are you doing?

1032
01:15:06,208 --> 01:15:08,834
I'm looking for money.

1033
01:15:08,917 --> 01:15:12,291
No, there's no money there.
Come on. Come on.

1034
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:31,583
Shit.

1035
01:15:33,208 --> 01:15:34,208
Um...

1036
01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:40,375
This isn't what you think, okay?

1037
01:15:40,458 --> 01:15:41,500
Yes, it is.

1038
01:15:41,583 --> 01:15:43,709
Well, it is, okay, but...

1039
01:15:45,125 --> 01:15:46,875
it isn't.

1040
01:15:48,959 --> 01:15:51,083
How long has this
been going on?

1041
01:15:53,166 --> 01:15:54,917
How long, Bob?

1042
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:59,250
Maybe a year.

1043
01:15:59,333 --> 01:16:03,625
So then you mean to tell me
that you were screwing her...

1044
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:07,375
when you had me
go down to Gooland's

1045
01:16:07,458 --> 01:16:12,208
and plead with him
like I had some sort
of legitimate case?

1046
01:16:12,291 --> 01:16:14,750
We went to high school together.
I've known her for years.

1047
01:16:14,834 --> 01:16:18,125
Are you saying to me you think
that makes it all right?

1048
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,667
Is that right? I just...
Tell me if I'm not
hearing something.

1049
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:27,250
I never said it made
everything okay. I just...

1050
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:28,583
I'll tell you what, Bob.

1051
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:32,834
You can screw her
all the hell you want,
but fuck you...

1052
01:16:37,333 --> 01:16:39,834
and fuck your job too.

1053
01:16:52,208 --> 01:16:53,625
Tom, so I cleared the decks,

1054
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:55,375
and I'll be flying
to Dallas on Monday.

1055
01:16:55,458 --> 01:16:57,250
- This is great, Russ.
- Can't wait, buddy.

1056
01:16:57,333 --> 01:16:58,917
No, great.
I look forward to it too.

1057
01:16:59,000 --> 01:16:59,750
I'll have everything set up.

1058
01:16:59,834 --> 01:17:01,250
All right then. All right.

1059
01:17:01,333 --> 01:17:02,083
I'll talk to you later.

1060
01:17:02,166 --> 01:17:03,583
Bye. Bye.

1061
01:17:07,834 --> 01:17:10,351
Plenty of
sunshine through today
with seasonal temperatures.

1062
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:14,417
We should reach our normal high
of about 82 degrees
by this afternoon.

1063
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:17,291
Clear skies tonight
with a low near 70.

1064
01:17:17,375 --> 01:17:19,000
Increasing cloudiness tomorrow,

1065
01:17:19,083 --> 01:17:21,750
sticky and humid
with a high of 96.

1066
01:17:21,834 --> 01:17:26,500
With the winds out of the east
at 14 miles per hour,
it's currently 75.

1067
01:17:26,583 --> 01:17:29,351
So it should just be
for a couple of days.
I'll check in and everything.

1068
01:17:29,375 --> 01:17:32,792
Okay, great.
Come here a second,
buddy. Will you?

1069
01:17:32,875 --> 01:17:34,959
I'm gonna miss you.
You know that, right?

1070
01:17:35,041 --> 01:17:37,726
I'm only gonna be gone
for a couple of days.
I'll call and talk to you.

1071
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:40,041
Just a couple.

1072
01:17:41,375 --> 01:17:43,959
Yeah, just a couple days.

1073
01:17:44,041 --> 01:17:46,208
Can I have a hug before I go?

1074
01:17:48,709 --> 01:17:50,750
Thank you, Cal.

1075
01:17:50,834 --> 01:17:52,834
I love you very much.

1076
01:17:52,917 --> 01:17:55,166
Okay, I'll miss you.
Now, listen to Charlotte,
okay?

1077
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:57,017
He'll listen to me.
He always listens. He's good.

1078
01:17:57,041 --> 01:17:58,667
He's good. Okay, thanks again.

1079
01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:00,393
Listen, Russ,
don't worry and good luck.
Don't worry about him.

1080
01:18:00,417 --> 01:18:01,625
Good luck with the job.

1081
01:18:01,709 --> 01:18:03,458
I'll see you later, Cal.
Say bye-bye.

1082
01:18:03,542 --> 01:18:05,166
Bye. Bye.

1083
01:18:16,875 --> 01:18:18,875
Welcome to Dallas, Mr. Durrell.

1084
01:18:18,959 --> 01:18:21,125
Thank you
for having me in Dallas.
You're welcome.

1085
01:18:21,208 --> 01:18:24,000
I should have
said howdy to you.
That's all right.

1086
01:18:24,083 --> 01:18:25,667
Bad joke. I see we have...

1087
01:18:34,792 --> 01:18:36,583
This is Russ Durrell.
How are you?

1088
01:18:36,667 --> 01:18:38,709
Very nice to meet you.
Welcome to Dallas.

1089
01:18:38,792 --> 01:18:41,041
Hey, thanks for having me.
You come highly recommended.

1090
01:18:41,125 --> 01:18:43,208
Tom here calls you voracious.

1091
01:18:43,291 --> 01:18:46,166
Mr. Newbauer, uh,
60 billable hours a week,

1092
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:49,542
52 weeks a year
seems very reasonable.

1093
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:53,834
Sixty-five would probably be
very profitable
for you gentlemen.

1094
01:18:53,917 --> 01:18:56,709
Seventy is my average.

1095
01:18:56,792 --> 01:18:58,083
How do you like your steak?

1096
01:18:58,166 --> 01:19:00,500
Well-done, please.

1097
01:19:00,583 --> 01:19:02,375
Pleasure to meet you.
My pleasure.

1098
01:19:02,458 --> 01:19:04,542
Welcome aboard.
Thank you very much.

1099
01:19:04,625 --> 01:19:05,750
Tom, good work.

1100
01:19:05,834 --> 01:19:08,208
I'll be seeing you.
Thanks for lunch, guys.

1101
01:19:08,291 --> 01:19:10,417
Have a good day.

1102
01:19:13,458 --> 01:19:15,250
You know, it seems small,

1103
01:19:15,333 --> 01:19:17,851
but I'm sure you know
you'll probably do nothing
but sleep in here.

1104
01:19:17,875 --> 01:19:19,583
And for a couple
of hours at that.

1105
01:19:19,667 --> 01:19:21,083
Yeah.

1106
01:19:21,166 --> 01:19:25,417
So, uh, it's just this,
uh, one bedroom here then?

1107
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:28,834
Mm-hmm. Yes.
You have to see this patio.

1108
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:36,208
You didn't like it?

1109
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:38,959
Oh, no, it's, uh, you know...
I have a kid is all.

1110
01:19:39,041 --> 01:19:41,875
Oh, I didn't know
you were married. How old?

1111
01:19:41,959 --> 01:19:46,583
Uh, he's five years old,
and I'm getting a divorce.

1112
01:19:46,667 --> 01:19:48,166
Does he live with you?

1113
01:19:51,375 --> 01:19:53,375
Oh. Okay.

1114
01:19:56,041 --> 01:19:57,834
Dad, everything
is really, really great.

1115
01:19:57,917 --> 01:20:01,083
You know, um, I got
that job here in Dallas.

1116
01:20:01,166 --> 01:20:03,083
You're kidding. I did.

1117
01:20:03,166 --> 01:20:04,846
Is that good news or what?
Congratulations.

1118
01:20:04,917 --> 01:20:06,834
No, it's good. It is. It's good.

1119
01:20:06,917 --> 01:20:10,792
So I figured, what the hell?
How can I pass an opportunity
like this up?

1120
01:20:10,875 --> 01:20:13,792
You absolutely cannot. Right.

1121
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:16,041
So I was just thinking,
you know...

1122
01:20:18,875 --> 01:20:20,709
Russ?

1123
01:20:22,542 --> 01:20:24,834
Dad? Yeah?

1124
01:20:26,542 --> 01:20:29,333
So this is what
we talked about, right?
What?

1125
01:20:31,709 --> 01:20:34,583
You know, you taking
Calvin for a while.

1126
01:20:34,667 --> 01:20:36,792
That's what we talked about.

1127
01:20:36,875 --> 01:20:41,291
Stop worrying.
Calvin is gonna
love it down here.

1128
01:20:41,375 --> 01:20:44,625
There's lots of kids there
for him to play with too, right?

1129
01:20:44,709 --> 01:20:46,667
I am so proud of you, son.

1130
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:50,333
'Cause he'll be leaving...
He'll be leaving
his best friend behind.

1131
01:20:50,417 --> 01:20:54,291
We can find some friends.
We're not a mile
from the rec center.

1132
01:20:54,375 --> 01:20:56,458
There are lots of kids.

1133
01:20:56,542 --> 01:20:57,667
Oh, good.

1134
01:20:57,750 --> 01:20:59,291
All right. Okay.

1135
01:20:59,375 --> 01:21:01,226
You're gonna call us
with the particulars, okay?

1136
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:03,330
I'll talk
to you soon, okay?
All right, we'll see you.

1137
01:21:03,375 --> 01:21:05,291
Bye.

1138
01:21:18,709 --> 01:21:21,041
Might be a good idea.

1139
01:21:21,125 --> 01:21:22,792
Don't you think?

1140
01:21:26,834 --> 01:21:27,834
It might be a good idea

1141
01:21:27,917 --> 01:21:31,291
to go see your grandfather
for a little while.

1142
01:21:35,583 --> 01:21:38,083
I'm on the back porch,
on the sun porch.

1143
01:21:38,166 --> 01:21:39,375
Hey, how you been?

1144
01:21:39,458 --> 01:21:41,098
I'm good. How about you?
I'm good. Thanks.

1145
01:21:41,125 --> 01:21:43,208
How did it all go?
It went well. Thanks.

1146
01:21:43,291 --> 01:21:44,208
Did it? Did you get it?

1147
01:21:44,291 --> 01:21:45,601
I got the job.
I start almost immediately.

1148
01:21:45,625 --> 01:21:47,250
You are something. You got it.

1149
01:21:47,333 --> 01:21:48,667
Yeah. How's Calvin?
How's he been?

1150
01:21:48,750 --> 01:21:51,267
Oh, my gosh!
They were so good together,
Russ. I can't even tell you.

1151
01:21:51,291 --> 01:21:53,208
They played.
They had a blast.
They slept great.

1152
01:21:53,291 --> 01:21:55,375
Not too much trouble?
Not too much trouble.

1153
01:21:55,458 --> 01:21:57,893
Where's Calvin?
Is he taking a nap
or something? Is he outside?

1154
01:21:57,917 --> 01:22:01,542
No. Kate came and picked him up
a couple of hours ago now

1155
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:02,976
and took him right home.
He was exhausted.

1156
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Really? Yeah.

1157
01:22:05,333 --> 01:22:06,834
Cal!

1158
01:22:08,667 --> 01:22:11,500
Kate! Are you home?

1159
01:22:47,583 --> 01:22:51,625
Excuse me.
Yes, there's no answer
at Room 11. Durrell.

1160
01:22:51,709 --> 01:22:53,500
She checked out this afternoon.

1161
01:22:56,041 --> 01:22:58,125
Did she say
where she was going
by chance?

1162
01:22:58,208 --> 01:22:59,685
Do you know if she had
a little boy with her?

1163
01:22:59,709 --> 01:23:02,542
I have no idea, sir.
All I know is she
checked out this afternoon.

1164
01:23:08,208 --> 01:23:10,000
Hello? Russell?

1165
01:23:10,083 --> 01:23:13,417
This was really smart,
Kate. You know?
This was really, really smart.

1166
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,017
Russ, I'm sorry
I did this so abruptly, okay,

1167
01:23:15,041 --> 01:23:16,834
but I didn't wanna
fight about things.

1168
01:23:16,917 --> 01:23:19,750
This isn't a tug-of-war.
It's not about us.
Right. Okay.

1169
01:23:19,834 --> 01:23:22,083
Listen, uh, is he all right?
Can I talk to him, please?

1170
01:23:22,166 --> 01:23:24,583
Yeah, he's fine. He's fine.
Can I talk to him, please?

1171
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:27,726
Russ, I think this is gonna
work out with you in Dallas
or wherever you're gonna be.

1172
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:31,291
Let me talk to him now, Kate!
Put him on the phone!

1173
01:23:31,375 --> 01:23:33,792
All right, hold on a minute.
Baby, Daddy wants
to talk to you.

1174
01:23:33,875 --> 01:23:34,959
Hello?

1175
01:23:35,041 --> 01:23:38,000
Cal? Hey, buddy,
are you all right?

1176
01:23:38,083 --> 01:23:39,667
Yeah, we went
to Chuck E. Cheese,

1177
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:41,792
and she and me
did the laser tag.

1178
01:23:41,875 --> 01:23:44,166
Is that a game?
Did you play some games?
That's good.

1179
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:45,834
It's a cool game.

1180
01:23:45,917 --> 01:23:48,959
And you play
in the dark and stuff,
and you shoot people.

1181
01:23:49,041 --> 01:23:51,166
Mm-hmm. With real lasers.

1182
01:23:51,250 --> 01:23:53,890
That's good, but I'm sure
you're starting to get
a little bit tired,

1183
01:23:53,959 --> 01:23:57,000
so why don't you tell Mom
to bring you back now, okay?

1184
01:23:57,083 --> 01:24:01,000
Hi, Russ, it's me.
Um, look, I'll call you as soon
as I get to Cincinnati...

1185
01:24:01,083 --> 01:24:03,291
at my sister's house,
and you can come see him, okay?

1186
01:24:03,375 --> 01:24:05,393
You're not gonna
call me when you get
to your sister's house, Kate.

1187
01:24:05,417 --> 01:24:06,709
You're gonna
turn around the car,

1188
01:24:06,792 --> 01:24:07,935
and you're gonna
bring him home now.

1189
01:24:07,959 --> 01:24:09,518
Russell, I'm doing you a favor,
and you know it.

1190
01:24:09,542 --> 01:24:11,976
You can't take
that kind of job in Dallas
and take proper care of Calvin.

1191
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,893
Is that what this is about?
Is that what this is about?

1192
01:24:13,917 --> 01:24:15,101
Yeah, that's right.
That's what this is about.

1193
01:24:15,125 --> 01:24:17,041
Because you have
absolutely no right

1194
01:24:17,125 --> 01:24:19,101
to make any decisions where
this child's life is concerned.

1195
01:24:19,125 --> 01:24:20,375
Do you understand me?

1196
01:24:20,458 --> 01:24:21,976
Oh, so what?
You're not taking
the job then?

1197
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,875
No, I am taking the job,
but I have made steps.

1198
01:24:24,959 --> 01:24:27,166
He's gonna be fine.
I've set things up, Kate.

1199
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:29,893
I've worked out everything,
and he's gonna be fine.
You understand me?

1200
01:24:29,917 --> 01:24:31,875
Well, he'll be fine
with me too, okay?

1201
01:24:31,959 --> 01:24:35,250
I'll talk to you later. Goodbye.

1202
01:24:35,333 --> 01:24:37,542
Hello?

1203
01:25:19,542 --> 01:25:20,959
Hi.

1204
01:25:23,166 --> 01:25:24,667
Hi.

1205
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:29,125
I know it was a cruel situation
that you were put in
the other day, Beth,

1206
01:25:29,208 --> 01:25:32,375
and I just wanted to
tell you that I didn't
mean for it to be that.

1207
01:25:33,917 --> 01:25:37,458
She's your wife, Russ.
No, she's, um...

1208
01:25:37,542 --> 01:25:40,458
Maybe for half a second,
I don't know,

1209
01:25:40,542 --> 01:25:43,667
I thought that, uh...

1210
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:46,959
I'm not really sure
what the hell it was
I was thinking,

1211
01:25:47,041 --> 01:25:50,875
but I wanted to tell you
that I'm sorry.

1212
01:25:52,375 --> 01:25:55,333
Maybe we should have just
waited a little longer.

1213
01:25:55,417 --> 01:25:57,667
Maybe.

1214
01:25:58,875 --> 01:26:01,625
I think I was
just stupid, really.

1215
01:26:01,709 --> 01:26:03,542
Yeah.

1216
01:26:04,542 --> 01:26:06,375
Mm-hmm.

1217
01:26:22,291 --> 01:26:24,417
I'm moving to Dallas.

1218
01:26:26,875 --> 01:26:29,542
What's in Dallas? A job.

1219
01:26:33,959 --> 01:26:36,333
When did this happen?

1220
01:26:36,417 --> 01:26:38,500
Well, I just said yes this week,

1221
01:26:38,583 --> 01:26:41,041
but it's something I've been
thinking about for a while.

1222
01:26:41,125 --> 01:26:44,709
And, uh, it's a great firm,

1223
01:26:44,792 --> 01:26:46,601
and it's the type of work
I've always wanted to do.

1224
01:26:46,625 --> 01:26:48,017
You know, I'm back
in the courtroom.

1225
01:26:48,041 --> 01:26:49,875
Congratulations.

1226
01:26:49,959 --> 01:26:53,291
But I honestly believe
it's for the best now.

1227
01:26:53,375 --> 01:26:56,208
Is that why you
let her take Calvin?

1228
01:26:56,291 --> 01:27:01,834
Well, she can...
give him a lot of things
that I can't give him.

1229
01:27:01,917 --> 01:27:04,500
Bullshit. I think
he should be with you.

1230
01:27:04,583 --> 01:27:06,208
She is his mother.

1231
01:27:06,291 --> 01:27:08,625
Yes, but she hasn't been
for a long time.

1232
01:27:14,125 --> 01:27:17,875
When I first planned on going
down there to Dallas, I thought
about taking him with me,

1233
01:27:17,959 --> 01:27:21,834
but once I got there,
I realized there's no way
this would work.

1234
01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:26,208
So I called my father up,

1235
01:27:26,291 --> 01:27:29,792
and I, uh, told him to take him.

1236
01:27:34,667 --> 01:27:36,834
I gave him away.

1237
01:27:40,458 --> 01:27:43,417
I felt like...

1238
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:47,500
this kid has robbed me
of my entire life.

1239
01:27:49,458 --> 01:27:52,542
I blamed him for my career.

1240
01:27:52,625 --> 01:27:55,542
I blamed him
for freakin' everything.

1241
01:27:55,625 --> 01:27:59,917
And I know, believe me,
that he's just a little boy,

1242
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,250
and that he hasn't
done anything.

1243
01:28:02,333 --> 01:28:04,041
Russ, you've gotta look
at what you did.

1244
01:28:04,125 --> 01:28:07,625
You brought him down here,
and you made a life for him,

1245
01:28:07,709 --> 01:28:11,500
and he's a great kid for it.

1246
01:28:12,375 --> 01:28:15,000
You didn't leave him.

1247
01:28:16,834 --> 01:28:19,834
He's a happy little boy.

1248
01:28:26,542 --> 01:28:28,583
You did that.

1249
01:28:33,583 --> 01:28:35,834
He belongs with you.

1250
01:29:22,750 --> 01:29:25,166
Hey, Russ. Harper.

1251
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:28,125
Um, listen, I, uh...

1252
01:29:28,208 --> 01:29:31,667
I gotta admit, I think I'm,
uh, out of my league here

1253
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:33,959
with the Councilman Thomas
business.

1254
01:29:34,041 --> 01:29:35,083
No shit, Bob.

1255
01:29:35,166 --> 01:29:38,625
Maybe you wanna come in.
We could work something out.

1256
01:29:38,709 --> 01:29:41,000
Uh, talk to you in a bit.

1257
01:29:41,083 --> 01:29:44,250
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Hold your breath.

1258
01:29:47,583 --> 01:29:50,041
Hi, um...

1259
01:29:50,125 --> 01:29:52,834
Shit.

1260
01:29:52,917 --> 01:29:54,583
Could you, could you
Fed-Ex that,

1261
01:29:54,667 --> 01:29:57,417
whatever he calls that-that
pillow thing of his
to my sister's house?

1262
01:29:57,500 --> 01:30:00,333
I completely spaced on it.
Flatso.

1263
01:30:00,417 --> 01:30:03,709
Hang on. Calvin wants
to talk to you.

1264
01:30:03,792 --> 01:30:07,417
- Hi, Dad.
- Can I have Mr. Flatso?

1265
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:11,667
Mom didn't bring him.
He's on my bed.

1266
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:13,709
I miss you, Dad.

1267
01:30:13,792 --> 01:30:15,709
Okay, we'll-we'll call you,

1268
01:30:15,792 --> 01:30:18,250
or you'll... you can call us
whenever you want.

1269
01:30:18,333 --> 01:30:22,041
Um, the sooner the better
with that pillow, and...

1270
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:24,625
I'll, um, talk to you later.

1271
01:30:24,709 --> 01:30:26,667
Bye.

1272
01:30:38,333 --> 01:30:40,041
Tom, this is Russ calling.

1273
01:30:40,125 --> 01:30:41,792
Listen, there's been
a change of plans.

1274
01:30:41,875 --> 01:30:45,083
I won't be coming
to Dallas tomorrow
or any time soon at all.

1275
01:30:45,166 --> 01:30:47,750
In fact, I won't
be taking the job.

1276
01:30:47,834 --> 01:30:50,291
Sorry about the inconvenience,

1277
01:30:50,375 --> 01:30:52,250
but I'll explain it
to you later.

1278
01:30:52,333 --> 01:30:53,625
Bye.

1279
01:31:10,417 --> 01:31:11,917
Cal!

1280
01:31:16,667 --> 01:31:18,542
Hey, buddy.

1281
01:31:22,375 --> 01:31:25,000
Hey. I missed you.

1282
01:31:25,083 --> 01:31:27,291
Missed you too.

1283
01:31:27,375 --> 01:31:30,250
For a while, I was
really scared, you know.

1284
01:31:30,333 --> 01:31:34,667
He was rolling
around on the floor,
kicking and screaming.

1285
01:31:34,750 --> 01:31:38,625
I think it was the hot dog
he had for dinner.

1286
01:31:38,709 --> 01:31:41,750
I tried rubbing his belly.

1287
01:31:41,834 --> 01:31:44,542
I put a hot compress on it.

1288
01:31:45,709 --> 01:31:48,000
But he just kept wailing.

1289
01:31:48,083 --> 01:31:50,500
Yeah.

1290
01:31:50,583 --> 01:31:52,959
He's probably just scared.

1291
01:31:58,625 --> 01:32:01,500
I finally locked myself
in the bathroom

1292
01:32:01,583 --> 01:32:03,750
and started crying, you know.

1293
01:32:06,917 --> 01:32:09,667
It's pretty funny, though.

1294
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:12,959
Me in there, him down here,
both of us bawling
our eyes out.

1295
01:32:25,792 --> 01:32:28,291
You can feel pretty
helpless sometimes.

1296
01:32:33,917 --> 01:32:37,625
I don't know, you know.
I just thought it would be
so different, you know?

1297
01:32:42,834 --> 01:32:45,166
When I was in the bathroom,
I was...

1298
01:32:45,250 --> 01:32:47,750
I was thinking
about the time that...

1299
01:32:49,291 --> 01:32:52,875
God, I don't even think
Calvin was six months old,

1300
01:32:52,959 --> 01:32:55,125
and we were down at the lake.

1301
01:32:56,417 --> 01:32:58,834
And it started to rain.

1302
01:33:01,291 --> 01:33:05,166
And you put him in,
in the ice chest, you know,
and you,

1303
01:33:05,250 --> 01:33:08,750
you covered, you covered him
with a blanket.

1304
01:33:14,291 --> 01:33:17,083
That's the way
I always think of him
when I think of him with you.

1305
01:33:17,166 --> 01:33:19,166
You know, being safe...

1306
01:33:20,458 --> 01:33:22,458
and protected
in a cool, dry place.

1307
01:33:22,542 --> 01:33:24,542
I never feel that way
when he's with me.

1308
01:33:26,709 --> 01:33:29,083
I wanna go home.

1309
01:33:29,166 --> 01:33:31,125
You ready?

1310
01:33:33,041 --> 01:33:34,875
Can I hold him for a while?

1311
01:33:34,959 --> 01:33:38,166
Yeah. Give Mom a hug, pal.

1312
01:33:59,083 --> 01:34:00,959
It's okay, Kate.

1313
01:34:01,041 --> 01:34:03,041
I love you, little man.

1314
01:34:06,083 --> 01:34:07,792
Go.

1315
01:34:07,875 --> 01:34:09,709
Come here, buddy.

1316
01:34:11,542 --> 01:34:13,250
Come here.

1317
01:34:18,333 --> 01:34:19,750
Cal.

1318
01:34:29,875 --> 01:34:31,542
Hey.

1319
01:34:33,041 --> 01:34:36,542
When's she coming back?

1320
01:34:36,625 --> 01:34:39,041
When she's sure we're gone.

1321
01:34:40,709 --> 01:34:42,875
It's hard to say
goodbye, you know.
Yeah.

1322
01:34:42,959 --> 01:34:44,917
Yeah.

1323
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:48,500
Are we going now? Mm-hmm.

1324
01:34:52,083 --> 01:34:54,208
Can you do me a favor? Mm-hmm.

1325
01:34:55,959 --> 01:34:58,250
Can you give me a kiss?

1326
01:35:02,208 --> 01:35:04,250
Thank you, Cal.

1327
01:35:10,917 --> 01:35:13,792
So I'm gonna
see you this afternoon?
Yep.

1328
01:35:13,875 --> 01:35:15,208
Is your dad comin'? Mm-hmm.

1329
01:35:15,291 --> 01:35:17,333
You think he'll get
on the horse this time?
No.

1330
01:35:17,417 --> 01:35:20,250
No? We should try
and talk him into it.
Don't you think?

1331
01:35:20,333 --> 01:35:21,500
Hey, Cal, here.

1332
01:35:21,583 --> 01:35:23,834
Let me talk to Beth
for a second,
will you, please?

1333
01:35:23,917 --> 01:35:25,375
Do you want me to talk to him?

1334
01:35:25,458 --> 01:35:26,834
Let me talk to Beth.

1335
01:35:26,917 --> 01:35:30,583
Please? Calvin,
what are you doing?
Come here. Come here, Cal.

1336
01:35:30,667 --> 01:35:31,875
Hey.

1337
01:35:31,959 --> 01:35:34,041
Cal?

1338
01:35:34,125 --> 01:35:35,834
Okay, that's it. My turn.
Thank you.

1339
01:35:35,917 --> 01:35:36,750
Cal, can I talk to him?

1340
01:35:36,834 --> 01:35:38,041
Hi, Beth. How are you?

1341
01:35:38,125 --> 01:35:41,583
He's so funny.
He thinks you're scared.

1342
01:35:41,667 --> 01:35:43,226
Well, it's not like
I'll get a better offer

1343
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:46,834
by just hanging
