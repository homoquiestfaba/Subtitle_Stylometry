00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,125

19
00:01:18,542 --> 00:01:20,917
Which cookies do you want?

20
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,542
Both: trick or treat.

21
00:01:25,542 --> 00:01:28,583

Yeah!

24
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,667
- Â™ª livin' on a dream â™ª

25
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:37,166
Wait, what does it say

26
00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:38,709
Right there.
What does it say?

27
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:41,333
- "Inter--
International."

28
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:42,834
- That's right.
That's right.

29
00:01:42,834 --> 00:01:44,166
- I was right.
- I believe it.

30
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,083
I believe it.
I do.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,709
- Great speech,
ms. Valedictorian.

32
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:55,375
You guys ready
to go take on the world?

33
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:57,375
-  I will settle
for a foot massage

34
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,000
And an umbrella drink.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,041
- Can you guys believe it?

36
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:03,875
We've graduated.
No more school ever!

37
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:06,000
Except for ms. Law school.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,041
She's got three more years.

39
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:10,709
- Now you finally get
to channel your hostility

40
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:12,709
Into something
that will get you paid.

41
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:14,333
- I know.

42
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,250
- It's a dream come true.

43
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,083
- So what about you, jen?
- You guys, i bought a house.

45
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:21,792

46
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:23,542
- Are you--You're joking.
- No, i'm serious.

47
00:02:23,542 --> 00:02:25,542
You know how i worked
every single job i could get

48
00:02:25,542 --> 00:02:27,834
And saved every cent
for a down payment.

49
00:02:27,834 --> 00:02:29,000
Both: yeah?

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,333
- And i got it, you guys.
I got a house.

51
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,125
And it's absolutely perfect.

52
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:35,750
- I mean...
- Congratulations.

53
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,667
- Leave it to the ceo

54
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:39,625
Ah!

- So we still on for friday?
- What's friday?

59
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,917
- Oh, i'm moving out
of the dorms.

60
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:53,166
Yeah, some silly rule
about needing to be a student

61
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,500
To live here.

62
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,667
- Oh. Ditched out
on your final paper again, huh?

63
00:02:56,667 --> 00:03:00,417
- Let's just say that's a--
- It's a work in progress.

64
00:03:00,417 --> 00:03:01,750
- Thank you.

65
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,583
- Do you guys still have
that disease

66
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,875
Where you finish
each other's sentences?

67
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:05,875
- Disease?
- Mm-Hmm.

68
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,333
Friday works perfectly.

69
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,125
- Thanks, jen.

70
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:10,458
Betsy.
- Bye.

71
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,041
- Satan--Sally.

72
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,917
- Always funny.

73
00:03:13,917 --> 00:03:15,291
- He is funny.

74
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:17,625
- Are you seriously gonna
let kevin just move in with you?

75
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,041
How is he supposed
to pay rent?

76
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:22,125
- Come on.
Kevin is great.

77
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,250
And charity begins
at home, right?

78
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,959
Besides, the place needs
a paint job, and...kev...

79
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,291
said he'd fix the fence.

80
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,792
- Kevin's a hoot, but are you
sure that's a good idea?

81
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:35,625
- Yes.

82
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:39,834
I've known kevin my whole life.
He's one of my oldest friends.

83
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:41,166
And it's just gonna be
a week or two

84
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,875
Until he gets on his feet.

85
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:46,458
I mean, come on.
What could possibly go wrong?

86
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:50,750
He's great, right?

87
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,458
Yes, mr. Fujimura.

88
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:00,792
The proposal for crystal towers
is right on schedule.

89
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:03,083
Great! I look forward
to your visit.

90
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,500
Great. See you next week.

91
00:04:08,417 --> 00:04:12,083
Hey! You're up early.

Penciled in at 4:00.

96
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,750
- I didn't know your caddy
skills were so in demand.

97
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,250
- Next week is junior prom.

98
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,875
All my coworkers
are out getting tuxes.

99
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:25,417
- Mm.
- What are you--What are you--

100
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:27,542
What are you doing?
What is this?

101
00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:28,750
- Hey, kevin.

102
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,166
- What have i told you
about instant coffee?

103
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:34,458
Yuck.

104
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,834
Have a soy latte,
not so much foam.

105
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:37,875
Yeah, almost as good
as being in--

106
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,709
- Venice.

107
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:41,250
Oh, one day,
when i'm not so crazed.

108
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,792
- Whatever happened to the girl
who used to pretend

109
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:44,375
She was a german
exchange student

110
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,709
To get free bratwurst?

111
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:48,208
- She got a job.
- Stupid jobs.

112
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,542
- I'm late.

113
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:51,208
The japanese backers
for crystal towers

114
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,709
Are coming into town
next week

115
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,208
And i have a ton of work
to do.

116
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,500
- Aren't you forgetting
something, my dear?

117
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,250
Hmm?

118
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,583
Hmm?

119
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:07,750
I packed an extra fruit roll,
dolphin-Safe tuna,

120
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,875
Extra pickles, no mayo.

121
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,792
Just the way you like it.

122
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:14,959
- You're the best.
- Yeah.

123
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,917
- Have a good day.
- You too.

124
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:20,041
- See you, napoleon.
Enjoy your day!

125
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,750
- You want breakfast?

126
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,417
Do you want breakfast?

127
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:28,959
Get over here.

128
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,291
Let's go get breakfast.

129
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:35,250
- So, with the restructuring
outlined in the proposal,

130
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,208
Our plan will give downtown
a whole new vision

131
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:41,083
And stay well within
your price range.

132
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,375
Thank you.

133
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:49,208
Thank you so much.
Enjoy your day.

134
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,875
Thank you.

135
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,834

137
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,500
- Thank you, mr. Monroy.
Really, thank you.

138
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,625
- You pull one of your
slam dunks with fujimura...

139
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:07,083
we could be talking
corner office.

140
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,542
Great work.

141
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:30,333
- How come i'm lucky enough
to get a girl like you?

142
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,667
- I guess you played
your cards right.

143
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:34,250
Hello.

144
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,375
What are you doing
this side of town anyway?

145
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,667
- I was in the neighborhood,

146
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:38,875
Scoping out our firm's
new offices,

147
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,125
And i thought i'd swing by.

148
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,333
I hope you're ready to dance

149
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,500
Those beautiful feet off
tonight.

150
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,959
- Bryce! Bryce!
That sounds good, it does.

151
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,500
Oh, and kevin was hoping

152
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,166
That we could try out
one of his new games.

153
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,792
- Kevin.
- Mm-Hmm.

154
00:06:49,792 --> 00:06:52,333
- You guys sure are
a package deal--

155
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,000
My best girl and her...

156
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,583

long-Time roommate.

157
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,917
- Oh, it hasn't been
that long, bryce.

158
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:00,083
- Sweetheart,
he's lived there seven years.

159
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:01,166
- He needs a helping hand.

160
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:03,375
- You know i love kevin,
but maybe he needs...

161
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,291
a nudge out of the nest,
get some goals.

162
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,291
- He has goals.

163
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,917
- A grown man making
board games.

164
00:07:07,917 --> 00:07:09,667
- Kevin's ship
will come in.

165
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:11,667
I know it.

166
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:14,834
- You are the nicest person
i've ever met,

167
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,792

00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,041
With mr. Johnson
and his family.

179
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:59,667
I heard her say the new partner
is gonna be johnson or you.

180
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:02,208
- Mrs. Von hoffman.

181
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:05,625
- Such a lovely boy, unlike some
who have yet to grow up.

182
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,583
- Did you hear that i signed
our friends on the coast?

183
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:10,208
- Well, you're making all sorts
of deals today, aren't you?

184
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:12,917
- I'll see you tonight.

185
00:08:12,917 --> 00:08:16,333
And bring that delightful
girlfriend of yours.

186
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,417
Ciao, darling.

187
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,792
- All right?
Mm-Hmm?

188
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,458
Nice shot, mr. Bellamy

189
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:46,291
Eh?
- Nice call, son.

190
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,500
- Good job!

191
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,333
- Ready, gentlemen?

192
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:53,667
- So, each samurai
fortifies a castle

193
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:55,333
To defend
the neighboring village

194
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,959
From the other players
on the hexagonal grid.

195
00:08:57,959 --> 00:08:59,375
What do you think?

196
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,041
- It's perfect
for ages eight to loser.

197
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,458
- Mm, kevin based it
on real history.

198
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,041
It's neat, huh?
- It's fascinating.

199
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,500
Sweetie, don't we have
a gala to go to?

200
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,792
- Can i just
fix my contacts first?

201
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,625
- Hey, what's that gala
that you guys are going to?

202
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:15,792
What's it for?

203
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:17,583
- My firm's just moving
into newer offices.

204
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:18,625
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

205
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,375
- Needed a bigger place
for your ego?

206
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:24,333
- Okay.

207
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,959
Okay. Ready.

208
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,667
Bye, kev.
Good night.

209
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:34,542
- Checkmate.

210
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:44,667
Told you.
- Yeah.

211
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:48,500
- Mr. Davis.

212
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,083
You remember jennifer.
- Hello, it's nice to see you.

213
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:54,125
- Will you please excuse me
for a second?

214
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,667
- Your jennifer's
quite a catch.

215
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,750
- Yes.

216
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,542
- Which firm is she with?
- She's with monroy and klein.

217
00:10:06,542 --> 00:10:08,208
- Impressive.

218
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:12,041
- She's lovely.

219
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,375
Darling, there's something

220
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,709
I've been meaning
to discuss with you.

221
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:16,375
- Yes, ma'am.

222
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,542
- As you know,

223
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:22,625
We are hiring
a new partner in july.

224
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,917
- I haven't really
given it much thought.

225
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:27,792
- Of course you haven't.

226
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:31,208
- Well, a word to the wise...

227
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,875
a young man should be able
to play the field,

228
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,834
But a partner needs
to project stability.

229
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,667
- I couldn't agree more.

230
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:38,291
And jennifer and i have been
going out exclusively

231
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,667
For six months.

232
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:41,625
- Really?

233
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:46,208
I know a certain receptionist
who would beg to differ.

234
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:49,834
Now, the choice
is between you and johnson.

235
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:51,709
His numbers aren't
as good as yours,

236
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:53,625
But he
is a solid family man.

237
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:57,458
I see.

238
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:01,834
- Your jennifer would make
some lucky man a fabulous wife.

239
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:03,250
Don't you agree?

240
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,917
- Yes.

241
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:08,917
Yes, i do.

242
00:11:08,917 --> 00:11:10,792
- Enjoy the party.

243
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:19,542
- I've gotta hand it to you.

244
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:22,750
In the past year, you've really
pulled your life together.

245
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,875
You've got a new job,
a great boyfriend.

246
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:29,792
I was starting to worry that
kevin was rubbing off on you.

247
00:11:29,792 --> 00:11:32,083
- What?

248
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,417
You are so wrong
about kevin.

249
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:36,125
He's one of
the smartest people i know,

250
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:38,917
And he's always had my back.

251
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:41,083
- Sweetie, i know that kevin's
your best friend,

252
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,417
And he's a puppy dog,

253
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:44,834
But don't you see
you're just enabling him?

254
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:46,291
You would actually be
doing him a favor

255
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,208
By making him stand
on his own two feet.

256
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,917
You know? Tough love.

257
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,709
- Come on!

258
00:11:57,709 --> 00:11:59,834
So my golden ticket
came in today.

259
00:11:59,834 --> 00:12:01,750
Mr. Bellamy's interested
in my game idea.

260
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,125
- That's great news, kev.

261
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,959
- Yeah, i've got a meeting
on saturday.

262
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,667
- Ah! Man!

263
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:11,834
- The game is off.

264
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:13,208
Bar exam's next month
and i've only slept

265
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,375
Two hours this week.

266
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:16,458
- Yeah, well,
you have to man up.

267
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,250
Tonight's poker night.

268
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,333
- Thought you had a date
tonight.

269
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,000
- Oh, she said, uh--
She canceled.

270
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,792
I wanna meet somebody nice,

271
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:26,917
Not too crazy.

272
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:28,917
- That rules out
all your past girlfriends.

273
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,417
Oh, wow.

274
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:34,834
Hey.

275
00:12:34,834 --> 00:12:36,208
- I gotta get back
to the library.

276
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,542
- Oh, come on.

277
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:39,417
- I've gotta read up
on tarts of contracts.

278
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:42,000
- Isn't that torts
and contracts?

279
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,625
- That's exactly why
i've gotta read up.

280
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,083
- Yeah.

281
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,125
- Anyway, we don't all have
three-Hour workdays, kev.

282
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:50,125
- Oh, may i remind you,
i may not pay rent,

283
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:52,417
But that house
runs smoothly.

284
00:12:52,417 --> 00:12:53,625
It's a win-Win.

285
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:56,000
- Maybe, but someday,
jen is gonna move on,

286
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,500
And when she does,
you gotta get a real job.

287
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,125
She's already got bryce.

288
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,500
- Bryce is totally wrong
for her.

289
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,208
And she'll figure it out
soon enough.

290
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,208
I know her.

291
00:13:07,542 --> 00:13:10,542
What a terrific evening.

292
00:13:10,542 --> 00:13:14,542
And i thought that you were
all tied up with work this week.

293
00:13:14,542 --> 00:13:18,417
- What could i say?
I had to see you.

294
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:22,250
- And i had to see you.

295
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,125
- Mm.

296
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:35,417
Because i wanted to see
if something fit.

297
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:37,291
- See if what fits?

298
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:40,375
- Come here.
- Okay.

299
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:44,959
- My grandmother's
engagement ring.

300
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,458
- Oh, my gosh.

301
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:50,917
- My grandfather brought
this ring from the old country.

302
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:52,625
He carried
across two continents,

303
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:54,417
But he used to say...

304
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,750
he'd carry it
to the end of the earth

305
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,500
For the woman he loved.

306
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,917
And now i know
just how he felt.

307
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:06,583
- Are you serious?

308
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:18,917
Jennifer...

309
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:23,875
what i want to know
is will you marry me?

310
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,875
- Yes.

311
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:29,458
Yes, of course.

312
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:34,333
Oh, it's beautiful.

313
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,458
It's a little loose,
but wow.

314
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,458
- I'll get it resized.

315
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:42,709
From here on, everything
is going to be perfect.

316
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,333
- Thank you.

317
00:14:49,917 --> 00:14:51,625
- I gotta check my messages.
I'll be right back.

318
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,959
- Mm-Hmm.

319
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,750
- Uh, kev. Hi
do you have a minute?

320
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,333
- Yeah!

321
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,333
I'm just going through
my game ideas book.

322
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:10,041
- Kev, we need to talk.
- Mm-Hmm. Okay.

323
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,709
- So you know how i said
that you could stay here

324
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:14,834
Until you got on your feet?
- Mm-Hmm.

325
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:17,333
- But kev,
that was seven years ago.

326
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,166
- Yeah, i know.
Time flies.

327
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:22,083
- Yeah.

328
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,709
- Uh, so there's something
that i need to tell you.

329
00:15:24,709 --> 00:15:26,917
- Okay.
- I have some news.

330
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:29,583
- Yeah?

331
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:32,417
- Bryce proposed.

332
00:15:33,917 --> 00:15:37,583
Bryce proposed?

333
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:40,291
Re--Really?

334
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,583
What?

335
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:44,583
Wow. What--What did he say
when you turned him down?

336
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,250
He cried, right?
Is he crying outside?

337
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,709
- No, kev.

338
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:51,333
I said yes.

339
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,083
- What?
-  Yes!

340
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,709
- No.
- Yes, i'm getting married.

341
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:00,542
Look.
- No. No, no.

342
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:01,917
You can't marry someone

343
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:03,709
After only knowing them
for six months.

344
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:04,959
- Oh, sure you can.

345
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,458
If it's the right person,
yes, you can.

346
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:09,709
- No, no.
Je--Jen!

347
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:12,875
I've seen you take longer
picking out fridge magnets.

348
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:17,458
Okay? Could you just think
about this for a second?

349
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,750
- I have.
I have thought about this.

350
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:22,625
Wow.

351
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:24,417
After the wedding,

352
00:16:24,417 --> 00:16:26,333
Bryce is gonna be
moving in here,

353
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:30,000
So i think it's best that--

354
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,750
You need to move out.
- Oh!

355
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,417
Who are you right now?

356
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:36,792
And what have you done
with jennifer?

357
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:39,625
- Kevin, this is gonna be
a really good thing for you.

358
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,250
It will give you a chance
to have structure in your life

359
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,250
And get a real job.

360
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,458
- I have a real job!

361
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:47,375
- And nobody believes
in your board games

362
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,250
And your caddying
more than i do.

363
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,583
- Who's gonna take napoleon
to the park?

364
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:54,333
Hmm?
Who's gonna feed the fish?

365
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,125
You don't even know
this guy.

366
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,417
I bet you he doesn't even know
what your favorite color is.

367
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,083
Green.

368
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,291
Your scarf is green,
your dress is teal.

369
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:06,291
It's a form of green.
You love green fridays.

370
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:10,834
- Kevin...

371
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:13,667
it's time.

372
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,125
It's gonna be a good thing
for you.

373
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,208
I know it.

374
00:18:15,834 --> 00:18:18,166
- Dad?

375
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:25,875
- Kevin, how many times
have i told you

376
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,458
About blocking my car?

377
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,792
A man's house
is his castle.

378
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:32,875
Consider my driveway
a piranha-Filled moat, okay?

379
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:37,166
- I'm sorry, mr. Henderson.
I'll be more careful.

380
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,709
- Kev,
you look terrible, kid.

381
00:18:39,709 --> 00:18:42,083
- I had a rough night.

382
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:46,458
- You should marry that girl.

383
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:57,959
Mr. Bellamy.

384
00:18:57,959 --> 00:18:59,792
Oh, i'm sorry.

385
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:02,917
I thought
you were somebody else.

386
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,375
- That sounds good.

387
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:19,417
- Bryce.

388
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:21,250
- Kevin.

389
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,000
What-What are you
doing here?

390
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,208
This isn't
your usual hangout.

391
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:27,041
- I swapped.
You too, i see.

392
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,166
- Uh, this is chandra.
Chandra, this is kevin.

393
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,333
- Hi!
- Hi.

394
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,250
- Why haven't we met before?
- Mm.

395
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,875
- I thought i knew
all of bryce's friends.

396
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,291
- Me too.
- Mm-Hmm.

397
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,250
- I'll be right back.

398
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:43,583
- Chandra's
a business colleague.

399
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:44,959
I don't know
what you think you saw--

400
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:47,125
- I know what i saw, bryce.
- Listen, caddy.

401
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:50,291
I'm not serious about chandra,
but i am about jennifer.

402
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:53,041
We have a future together.

403
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:56,125
Don't you mess that up.

404
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,291
- Hi, kevin.
- Mr. Bellamy...

405
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:14,291
i-I gotta go.

406
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,667
Jen, i saw something today.
Um--

407
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:21,959
- Yeah, i know.

408
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:23,291
Bryce told me
you ran into each other today.

409
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:26,625
- He did?
- Yeah.

410
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,083
He had a meeting with chandra.
He said he ran into you.

411
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,417
- You know about her?
- Yeah, she's great.

412
00:20:31,417 --> 00:20:34,667
She heads up
the midwest operations.

413
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:37,250
- Wha--Okay.

414
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,834
Okay, well,
brace yourself, okay?

415
00:20:40,834 --> 00:20:42,208
Because i--

416
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:46,667
I hate to have to be the one
to tell you this, but...

417
00:20:46,667 --> 00:20:48,834
she was all over him.

418
00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:51,417
- Kevin, is this because
you want things to go back

419
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,333
To the way they were?
- What--No!

420
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:56,625
No! I feel like my brain
is about to explode!

421
00:20:57,834 --> 00:20:59,333
- Jen?

422
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,333
- Yep, there it goes.

423
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:05,166
- Oh. And how are
my two favorite people?

424
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,834
- Hi.
- How's it packing, kevin?

425
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:08,333
I know
it's a bit of a shock,

426
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,834
But you're gonna thank us
for this one day, okay, buddy?

427
00:21:09,834 --> 00:21:12,208
Honey, did i leave my
gold cufflinks in the kitchen?

428
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,583
I need them for my trip.

429
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,375
- Oh, absolutely.
I will go get them.

430
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:24,375
Too bad, caddy.
Your meal ticket's been pulled.

431
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:27,709
- Oh, you cheating jerk.

432
00:21:27,709 --> 00:21:29,375
- You know,
if i wasn't schooled

433
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,250
In the teachings
of the dalai lama,

434
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:37,250
I'd wipe that smile right off
your two-Timing face.

435
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,375
Mm.

436
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,959
What the heck, huh?

437
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:43,083
Aah!

438
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,875
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey!

439
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,750
- I'll get 'em to stop.

440
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,792
Don't make me get
my leaf blower, you two.

441
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,083
- Aah!

442
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,250
- Okay! Okay!

443
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,083
- What are you doing?

444
00:22:08,083 --> 00:22:09,417
- Oh, honey.

445
00:22:09,417 --> 00:22:11,250
- It's a $2,000 suit!

446
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,250
Ah!
He bit me!

447
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,625
We'll get inside and we'll
get something on it, okay?

448
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:18,875
Kevin!

449
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:21,917
- I got it worse!
He tastes like deodorant!

450
00:22:21,917 --> 00:22:24,583
- Kevin.

451
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:27,583
That was pathetic.

452
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:29,417
- It's not even funny.

453
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:31,709
It's not even funny, man!

454
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,291
Bryce wants a trophy wife.

455
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:38,291
He's totally, utterly wrong
for her.

456
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:41,083
- Look, nothing you can do.

457
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:42,208
Why are you really so upset?

458
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:43,917
- Because it's jen.

459
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:45,709
She's rushing into this.

460
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:47,291
I just feel like
this freight train is heading

461
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:50,000
Right toward my best friend,
and i gotta do something.

462
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,333
If only i could just buy
a little more time.

463
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:55,208
She'd see for herself
how wrong bryce is for her.

464
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,709
And as her best friend,

465
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,333
I have to do everything
in my power to protect her.

466
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,250
- Hmm.

467
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,625
That's funny.

468
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:02,792
In a lot of states,

469
00:23:02,792 --> 00:23:05,792
You'd practically
be married yourselves.

470
00:23:05,792 --> 00:23:08,959
Common-Law marriage anyway.

471
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:12,000
- Wait, what do you--
What do you mean common law?

472
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,625
- It goes back
to frontier times

473
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:18,625
When people didn't live
close enough to a city

474
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:21,000
To get married
by a justice of the peace.

475
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,166
- Uh-Huh.
Uh-Huh.

476
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:23,542
- Lawmakers knew
they had to do something

477
00:23:23,542 --> 00:23:26,166
So that people living farther
afield could get married.

478
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:28,000
So...

479
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
they decreed that
if people lived together

480
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,250
A certain period of time,
met certain conditions,

481
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,625
Then the state would step in
and make the whole thing legal.

482
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,375
- Really?

483
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:42,417
- It's called
a common-Law marriage.

484
00:23:42,417 --> 00:23:44,750
- And how is this different
than a real marriage?

485
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,959
- It is a real marriage.

486
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:47,333
If you've got
a common-Law marriage,

487
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:50,792
In the eyes of the law,
you're a husband and wife.

488
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:54,750
- Common law.

489
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:06,959
Hi, jen.
- Hi, kev.

490
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:08,250
- Whatcha doing?

491
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,792
- Oh, i'm just looking up ideas
for the reception.

492
00:24:10,792 --> 00:24:12,166
- Hmm.

493
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:14,208
- I've always wanted a gazebo
in the backyard

494
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:17,542
And this place
has beautiful ones.

495
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:20,500
- That's nice.

496
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:25,125
- So, uh,
how's the packing going?

497
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:28,375
- I learned
something important today.

498
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:29,709
Something big.

499
00:24:29,709 --> 00:24:32,291
- Which is?

500
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:34,125
- You can't marry bryce.

501
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:37,041
- Okay, kevin--
- You ever heard of common law?

502
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:38,542
Hmm?

503
00:24:38,542 --> 00:24:40,709
Well, common law states
that a man and woman

504
00:24:40,709 --> 00:24:44,709
That have been living together
for seven years--Like us--

505
00:24:44,709 --> 00:24:48,208
Uh, and they meet
certain conditions--

506
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:51,083
Well, they're considered married
in the eyes of the law,

507
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:53,250
Which would make us...

508
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,083
husband and wife.

509
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:56,458
- Who told you that?

510
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:57,750
- Oh, jeremy told me that.

511
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,083
- Oh, jeremy.
- Mm-Hmm.

512
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:00,250
- Jeremy told you that.

513
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,917
Jeremy who's passed the bar exam
how many times?

514
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,583
- Yeah, okay.
- Zero.

515
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:05,250
- Fair enough.
But, uh, jen?

516
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:08,875
- Okay, this is ridiculous.
- Yeah.

517
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:12,583
Oh.

518
00:25:14,917 --> 00:25:17,333
Okay.

519
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:19,792
This marriage is gonna take
a little work.

520
00:25:24,792 --> 00:25:27,291
- Coming!

521
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:30,959
- I dropped the kids
at daycare

522
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:32,959
And came over
as fast as i could.

523
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:35,417
Now about
this little situation.

524
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:36,667
- I feel ridiculous asking,

525
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:38,959
But i have to be
absolutely sure.

526
00:25:38,959 --> 00:25:40,625
- Don't look so worried, okay?
- Okay.

527
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:42,041
- In order for someone
to be able to argue

528
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,542
That a common-Law
marriage exists,

529
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,417
There are some very specific
conditions that need to be met.

530
00:25:45,417 --> 00:25:47,875
- Okay, so this is all
just nonsense, right?

531
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:50,458
- Oh, i'm sure that you have
nothing to worry about.

532
00:25:50,458 --> 00:25:51,917
- Okay.

533
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:54,542
- So there are four conditions
that must be met.

534
00:25:54,542 --> 00:25:56,333
- Four, right.

535
00:25:58,208 --> 00:25:59,917
- So first and foremost,

536
00:25:59,917 --> 00:26:01,417
The couple in question
needs to be a man and woman

537
00:26:01,417 --> 00:26:04,458
Living in a state where
common law applies, like here.

538
00:26:04,458 --> 00:26:05,500
- Mm-Hmm.

539
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,417
- Right.
- Second.

540
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:09,500
They both need to have lived
in the same residence

541
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,166
For at least seven years.

542
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:13,834
So you meet
both those things.

543
00:26:13,834 --> 00:26:15,542
- Mm-Hmm.
- Mm-Hmm.

544
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:16,583
- Relax.

545
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:19,500
So do a million people, okay?
- Okay.

546
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,000
- It's the last two that are
definitely the most important.

547
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,417
So during the seven years,

548
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,583
The couple needs to have,
at least once,

549
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,667
Held themselves out
as a married couple.

550
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:28,667
And i mean,

551
00:26:28,667 --> 00:26:30,834
You never did that, right?
- No!

552
00:26:30,834 --> 00:26:31,917
No. Like introduce him
as my husband?

553
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:32,834
- Okay.

554
00:26:32,834 --> 00:26:33,834
- Like,
"hi, my name's jennifer,

555
00:26:33,834 --> 00:26:36,166
And this is my husband,
kevin."

556
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:37,917
- Good! Good.
That's great.

557
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:40,792
And i mean, you never, like,
used the same last name

558
00:26:40,792 --> 00:26:42,583
On any public documents.

559
00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:45,917
- No!
No, i have ne--

560
00:26:45,917 --> 00:26:47,291
- What is that face?

561
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:49,041
- Well, we took that cruise
to mazatlan,

562
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:52,709
And i might've said
that he was my husband

563
00:26:52,709 --> 00:26:54,667
So we'd get
the half-Off deal.

564
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:56,709
- Right.

565
00:26:56,709 --> 00:26:59,750
- And, uh, don't forget
the cable account.

566
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,375
- And the cable account.

567
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:03,875
- That's only three conditions.

568
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:06,083
The fourth is definitely
the most important.

569
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:08,125
- Okay.

570
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:10,709
- So the law
specifically states

571
00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:12,208
That at least one
of the two parties

572
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:13,709
Must be able to argue that
there was an intention to marry

573
00:27:13,709 --> 00:27:15,875
At some point, and the only way
to prove that,

574
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:18,875
There must be some sort
of public exchanging of vows

575
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:20,875
Or the giving
of a symbolic gift.

576
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:23,875
And...that didn't happen,
right?

577
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:25,375
- No!
No, that never happened.

578
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:26,750
- Okay.

579
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:30,583
- Hey, what about that ring?

580
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:36,709
- Ow.

581
00:27:36,709 --> 00:27:39,166
- Ring? What ring?

582
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:40,542
- This.

583
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:43,291
What? It's a friendship ring
kevin gave to me.

584
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:44,709
Please.
It's not worth anything.

585
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:46,417
His mom made it
when she lived in a commune

586
00:27:46,417 --> 00:27:47,917
Back in the '70s.

587
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:51,625
- So that is a family heirloom
and kevin gave it to you.

588
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:54,583
- What?

589
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:56,083
- Look, jennifer,

590
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:58,917
This is about an accumulation
of evidence, okay?

591
00:27:58,917 --> 00:28:01,917
And right now,
even kevin's dolt of a brother

592
00:28:01,917 --> 00:28:04,291
Could potentially argue
that the acceptance of a ring,

593
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:07,542
In itself, denotes the implied
intention of marriage.

594
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:10,125
- So are you telling me
that kevin

595
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:13,709
Might actually have a case

596
00:28:13,709 --> 00:28:17,959
That he and i are married?

597
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:20,625
- Uh, yes.

598
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:25,208
- Hey, honey.
How's chicago?

599
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:26,667
- Incredible.

600
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:28,375
It's pure adrenaline with
all these movers and shakers.

601
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:31,458
- Bryce, there's something
that i need to tell you.

602
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:32,834
- So how'd it go
with the caterers this morning?

603
00:28:32,834 --> 00:28:35,291
- Um...

604
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:38,625
actually, something came up.
I didn't get a chance to--

605
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:40,041
- You missed henri?

606
00:28:40,041 --> 00:28:42,667
- I'm sorry, okay?

607
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:44,458
I just didn't
get a chance to--

608
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:46,166
- Henri is a personal friend
and the best chef in the city.

609
00:28:46,166 --> 00:28:47,792
He's doing this
as a favor to me.

610
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:50,208
- Bryce, i know.
I'm sorry, okay?

611
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:51,875
- No, it's okay.
I'll handle it.

612
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:54,125
On a lighter note,
guess who booked the arboretum.

613
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:56,083
Ha, i know
how much you love it there.

614
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:58,750
I had to pull a few strings,
but voila.

615
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:01,208
- Oh.

616
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:02,458
That's great.

617
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:03,917
- I thought
you'd be more excited.

618
00:29:03,917 --> 00:29:05,667
- No, no, no.
I am.

619
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:08,458
It's--I am.
It's a dream come true, really.

620
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:10,542
- Now what did you
wanna tell me?

621
00:29:12,583 --> 00:29:15,250
- Um...

622
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,500
nothing.

623
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,625
So...

624
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:20,667
how was your flight?

625
00:29:20,667 --> 00:29:22,458
- Sweetheart, can i call you
back in a few minutes?

626
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:24,583
- Yep.
- All right, bye.

627
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:30,542
- Hello.
- Hi. I'm bryce.

628
00:29:30,542 --> 00:29:33,125
Can i buy you guys a drink?
- Please.

629
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:35,875
- Yeah.

630
00:29:40,542 --> 00:29:42,709
- So as you can see
from chart 2a,

631
00:29:42,709 --> 00:29:44,125
In its first stage
of construction,

632
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:47,750
We are at an occupancy rate
of 89% for crystal towers.

633
00:29:49,542 --> 00:29:51,667
- Yeah. Ah.

634
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,542
- Excuse me just one moment,
please.

635
00:29:58,542 --> 00:30:01,875
Thank you.
I'll be back.

636
00:30:08,208 --> 00:30:09,333
Kevin.
- Hi.

637
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:11,291
- Hi.
What are you doing here?

638
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:13,458
- Well, you're so busy,
you know.

639
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:16,125
You kinda took off in a hurry
and you forgot your lunch.

640
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:17,542
- Kevin--
- Yeah?

641
00:30:17,542 --> 00:30:21,375
- I just heard the good news.
Congratulations!

642
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:23,500
- Thanks!
- For what?

643
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,667
- Well, you two of course.

644
00:30:25,667 --> 00:30:27,500
Jen.

645
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,417
Ha! I mean, i can't believe
you kept this quiet.

646
00:30:30,417 --> 00:30:32,583
Hey, by the way,
where are you guys registered?

647
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:34,083
- Uh--

648
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:37,417
- We are not registered.

649
00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:40,417
I will tell you
all about it later.

650
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:43,667
- Okay.

651
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:45,250
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, i--

652
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,625
I was outside
and they were asking me

653
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:48,583
Who i was gonna
come in here and see.

654
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:50,291
And i might've blurted out
that--

655
00:30:50,291 --> 00:30:51,959
- That i was your...

656
00:30:51,959 --> 00:30:53,291
wife.

657
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:54,917
- I'm sorry, okay?

658
00:30:54,917 --> 00:30:56,458
They weren't gonna let me
in here, jen.

659
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:58,792
I only told the receptionist
and the doorman.

660
00:30:58,792 --> 00:31:01,083
- There is no doorman
in this building!

661
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:05,583
- Nice guy.
Asian man.

662
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:09,375
- Kevin...

663
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:14,125
that is mr. Fujimura,
my biggest client.

664
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,000
Okay.
- This is--

665
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,333
- Yep.
Great, thank you.

666
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:25,792
- Can you believe it?
Me and kevin a couple.

667
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:29,792
I mean, have you ever heard
anything so absurd?

668
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:32,667
- No, but...

669
00:31:32,667 --> 00:31:34,333
as your legal counsel,

670
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:37,959
I'm gonna need
all of the facts, you know?

671
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:41,333
Tell me you guys
were never romantic, please.

672
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:44,125
With kevin?

673
00:31:44,125 --> 00:31:45,500
- Yeah.

674
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,333
- No! Are you crazy?

675
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:50,333
- Some women might fall for his
whole hopeless teddy bear thing.

676
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:57,375
- Yes, yes, yes.

677
00:31:57,375 --> 00:32:00,333
Okay. Okay, good, good.
I like that. Okay.

678
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:01,333
- Hmm.

679
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:02,333
- Ooh, i like that,
the offering.

680
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:03,667
A peace offering?

681
00:32:03,667 --> 00:32:06,291
Nice! Let's see the pacifist.

682
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:09,875
- Ooh, that's peaceful.
Ha ha.

683
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:11,458
Hey, jen.
Um...

684
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:13,375
we were just taking pictures

685
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:14,959
For the warrior cards
in the game.

686
00:32:14,959 --> 00:32:17,834
- So you're the one that
put kevin up to all this, huh?

687
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:19,709
And you consider yourself
a lawyer?

688
00:32:19,709 --> 00:32:22,375
- Well, i'm hoping to go
into environmental law, so--

689
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:23,709
- You wouldn't know
a real lawyer

690
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:26,000
If she walked up
and she bit you.

691
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,291
- Kevin, you and me!
Outside!

692
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:29,583
- What?

693
00:32:29,583 --> 00:32:33,083
But i didn't--Ow!

694
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:36,041
- Kevin, that stunt you pulled
at my office today

695
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:37,375
Was completely out of line!

696
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:39,125
- I was bringing you lunch.

697
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:40,917
I was trying to be helpful.

698
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,583
I was trying to show you that
a husband can share the load.

699
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:45,083
- Oh, you wanna share
the load?

700
00:32:45,083 --> 00:32:47,000
Then deal with this.

701
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,750
I'm supposed to meet
my japanese financers

702
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,083
For dinner tonight,

703
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:52,709
And since you introduced
yourself as my husband,

704
00:32:52,709 --> 00:32:54,709
Now they want us both
to come celebrate.

705
00:32:54,709 --> 00:32:56,875
- Oh.

706
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:59,375
Yeah, that's my bad.

707
00:33:07,166 --> 00:33:09,125
- Kevin should be here
any moment.

708
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:12,083
- Ah.

709
00:33:15,792 --> 00:33:18,291
- Hi. I'm just here--
- Oh, there he is now.

710
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,417
Will you excuse me
just a moment?

711
00:33:21,417 --> 00:33:23,083
- Please.

712
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:26,083
- Hi.

713
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:33,000
- Okay, so do what we rehearsed.
- Yes.

714
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,458
- You're only gonna be here
a few minutes,

715
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:35,875
And then you're
just gonna go, okay?

716
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:37,166
- Relax.

717
00:33:37,166 --> 00:33:38,917
- Okay.

718
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:41,250
Mm?
Madam.

719
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,792
- No.
- Okay, no french. Got it.

720
00:33:42,792 --> 00:33:44,125
- No french.
- We up here?

721
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:46,667
- Ah, please.

722
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:52,458
- Mr. Fujimura,
this is my...

723
00:33:52,458 --> 00:33:53,875
-  husband.
- Kevin.

724
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:55,834
- Ah.

725
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:57,333
- Oh, .

726
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:59,500
- We are most honored
to formally meet

727
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,792
The new husband
of jennifer.

728
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:02,917
- Ah.

729
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:04,583
- We congratulate you.

730
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:07,458
- Oh.
- Please sit down.

731
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:09,625
Everyone, please.

732
00:34:09,625 --> 00:34:11,875
- Thank you.

733
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:15,000
I can do it. Okay.
- Oh, okay. Gotcha.

734
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,166
- Can i offer you some wine?
- Uh, yes, please.

735
00:34:20,166 --> 00:34:25,458
- May i ask what kind
of work you do, mr. Kevin?

736
00:34:25,458 --> 00:34:29,333
- Well, uh,
i am currently active

737
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:34,792
In the recreational services
industry,

738
00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:37,333
Specifically
the golf sector.

739
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:42,083
And i mean that i think
of my best ideas

740
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:43,583
On the golf course.

741
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:45,500
- Oh, how smart.

742
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:50,583
- Enough about me though, huh?

743
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:53,041
Um, let's toast
to your new venture.

744
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:55,333
- Ah.

745
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:58,709
Excellent.

746
00:34:58,709 --> 00:35:01,500
We are most excited
to move forward.

747
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,125
However, there is
a small complication

748
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:08,458
That is risen
with the board.

749
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:10,500
My coworker has informed me

750
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,500
That several
of the zoning permits

751
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:19,709
Are still outstanding
in this project.

752
00:35:19,709 --> 00:35:21,667
- Uh, if i may--
-  Kevin, it's fine.

753
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:23,041
- It's okay.
I got this.

754
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:24,875
Um...

755
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:27,834
let me tell you a little story
about jennifer here.

756
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,166
A couple years back,

757
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:31,542
Our garbage cans
kept getting knocked over

758
00:35:31,542 --> 00:35:33,291
In the middle of the night
every night.

759
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:35,709
Did a little investigating.

760
00:35:35,709 --> 00:35:38,583
Turns out we had a big family
of raccoons

761
00:35:38,583 --> 00:35:41,625
That had moved in
underneath our house.

762
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:45,709
And since it was, like,
thanksgiving weekend,

763
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:46,750
The animal control guy

764
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,417
Couldn't do
a darn thing about it.

765
00:35:48,417 --> 00:35:49,667
- Where is the waiter?

766
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:51,542
- We had 20 people
coming over for dinner.

767
00:35:51,542 --> 00:35:52,792
- Okay.

768
00:35:52,792 --> 00:35:54,083
- Jen, here, wouldn't take
no for an answer,

769
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:56,500
So with just an address book
and a dying cell phone,

770
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,417
Bam!--
In 30 minutes flat,

771
00:35:58,417 --> 00:36:01,083
She had
the deputy mayor himself

772
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:04,250
Crawling around underneath
our house with a flashlight.

773
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:09,000
Problem solved, and...

774
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,333
you know,
the point of the story

775
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:14,208
Is that jennifer here--
There is nothing...

776
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:18,208
that she can't accomplish
or achieve.

777
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:20,041
She says she's gonna
get you those permits,

778
00:36:20,041 --> 00:36:22,583
Well, by golly,
she's gonna do it.

779
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:37,458
I shall relay that
to the board.

780
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:41,959
- That-That's great!

781
00:36:41,959 --> 00:36:43,333
Wow!

782
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:45,333
You know, i know we don't
really know each other,

783
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:47,375
But i think we all have
something in common here.

784
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:48,834
We all think jennifer here

785
00:36:48,834 --> 00:36:51,000
Is just pretty darn amazing,
right?

786
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,458
Huh? Kanpai! Kanpai!
- Yes, kanpai.

787
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:54,792
- Kanpai!
- Kanpai.

788
00:36:54,792 --> 00:36:56,291
- Whoo!

789
00:36:56,291 --> 00:37:00,208
Yeah! Get in there!
To jennifer.

790
00:37:00,208 --> 00:37:03,583
- Sally,
i can't believe it.

791
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:04,959
- Is it horrible?
It's horrible.

792
00:37:04,959 --> 00:37:06,291
Is it terrible?

793
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:09,125
- No. Kevin actually--
He's being amazing.

794
00:37:09,125 --> 00:37:12,709
He pulled this whole thing off
and he even saved the day.

795
00:37:12,709 --> 00:37:14,458
- That is definitely not
what i thought you'd say.

796
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:16,667
- I know.
- How long did he stick around?

797
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,125
- Uh, he's still here.
He's at the table.

798
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:19,625
- Wait, you left kevin alone

799
00:37:19,625 --> 00:37:21,125
At a table with
your most important client?

800
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:25,500
- And now the musical stylings
of kevin duncan.

801
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,458
- I have to go.
- Yeah, okay, bye.

802
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:31,667
- This is the captain
of the pinafore.

803
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:32,959
- Kevin!
- Yeah.

804
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,166
- This is not a karaoke bar.
- Oh, yes, it is.

805
00:37:35,166 --> 00:37:37,500
For the h.M.S. Pinafore,
yes, it is! Right?

806
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,750
- I'm totally gonna lose
my job.

807
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:41,125
Mr. Fujimura, i am so sorry.
This whole thing--

808
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:44,458
- I know this song!
That's how i learn english.

809
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:47,458
- Ooh!

810
00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:55,792
Â™ª i am the captain
of the pinafore â™ª

811
00:37:55,792 --> 00:37:58,125
Â™ª and a right good captain too â™ª

812
00:37:58,125 --> 00:38:00,500
Â™ª you're very, very good

813
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,542
Â™ª i command

814
00:38:02,542 --> 00:38:04,875
Both: â™ª we're very, very good

815
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:07,166
Â™ª he commands
a right good crew â™ª

816
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:09,333
- Â™ª though related to a peer
i can hand, reef, and steer â™ª

817
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:11,750
Â™ª and ship a selvagee â™ª

818
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:15,625
Â™ª i am never known to quail
at the fury of a gale â™ª

819
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:17,750
Â™ª and i'm never,
never sick at sea â™ª

820
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,375
- Â™ª what, never? Â™ª
- Â™ª no, never â™ª

821
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:25,083
- Â™ª what, never? Â™ª
- Â™ª well, hardly ever â™ª

822
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:29,667
- Â™ª he's hardly ever
sick at sea â™ª

823
00:38:29,667 --> 00:38:32,625
Both: â™ª then give three cheers
and one cheer more â™ª

824
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:35,083
Â™ª for the hardy captain
of the pinafore â™ª

825
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:37,583
Â™ª then give three cheers
and one cheer more â™ª

826
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:40,500
Â™ª for the captain
of the pinafore â™ª

827
00:38:47,917 --> 00:38:49,417
- Yeah!
Fantastic!

828
00:38:49,417 --> 00:38:51,750
Triple threat.
Triple threat.

829
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,417
Right?

830
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:54,750
- No.
- Yes.

831
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:58,458
Mr. Fujimura, everybody.

832
00:39:03,083 --> 00:39:07,917
- I mean, who knew
mr. Fujimura could sing?

833
00:39:07,917 --> 00:39:10,041
I know.

834
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:11,500
He's a triple threat.

835
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,125
He can sing, he can dance.
His origami cranes--

836
00:39:14,125 --> 00:39:16,208
Terrific.

837
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:18,458
I think
he had a good time.

838
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:20,041
He said next time
he visits,

839
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:22,208
He's bringing his wife michiko
and the kids.

840
00:39:23,959 --> 00:39:25,709
I don't know what to say
to you right now.

841
00:39:25,709 --> 00:39:27,792
- Was that a laugh?

842
00:39:27,792 --> 00:39:29,875
- Oh, no,
i'm still very angry at you.

843
00:39:33,709 --> 00:39:35,750
No.

844
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:39,458
You did good.

845
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:42,166
It really was
an unforgettable evening, so...

846
00:39:42,166 --> 00:39:43,834
thank you, kev.

847
00:39:43,834 --> 00:39:45,542
- Oh, it's not over yet.

848
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:48,458
- What do you mean?

849
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:50,375
What the--Kevin!

850
00:39:50,375 --> 00:39:51,834
All: surprise!

851
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:57,792
- Behold, the wedding reception
we've never had.

852
00:39:59,041 --> 00:40:01,500
- Yeah!
Whoo-Hoo!

853
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,834
Yeah!

854
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:04,208
- Yeah.

855
00:40:10,166 --> 00:40:14,166
- I must admit, you throw
a great party for a dead man.

856
00:40:14,166 --> 00:40:16,333
- Thank you.

857
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:19,208
Mm-Mm.

858
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,834
- Mr. Henderson,
i am so sorry.

859
00:40:21,834 --> 00:40:23,208
Are we being too loud?
I'm so--

860
00:40:23,208 --> 00:40:24,667
- For years,
i've been saying

861
00:40:24,667 --> 00:40:27,500
These two characters
ought to get hitched.

862
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,542
And now you have,
you sly monkeys!

863
00:40:32,834 --> 00:40:35,333
- Thank you, but...no.

864
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:36,667
- Would you please
try to get kevin

865
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:39,166
To stop blocking my driveway
with his car?

866
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:40,375
That way
i won't be over here

867
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:41,709
Banging on your door
all the time.

868
00:40:41,709 --> 00:40:42,875
- Uh--
- Uh, will do.

869
00:40:42,875 --> 00:40:44,000
- All right.
Par-Tay.

870
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,083
- Move your car.
- I know. I'm sorry.

871
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:47,000
Sorry about that.

872
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,834
Whoo!
- Mm.

873
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:27,875
- Jen!

874
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:29,917
Babe, you here?

875
00:41:29,917 --> 00:41:33,291
- Bryce?

876
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:34,792
You're back early.

877
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:36,458
- Yes. You'd know that
if you checked your messages.

878
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:37,667
- I'm sorry, okay?

879
00:41:37,667 --> 00:41:39,667
Everything has been
extremely crazy.

880
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:42,250
- Yeah, so i see.

881
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:45,208
"Congratulations,
newlyweds."

882
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:46,875
Did kevin finally snap

883
00:41:46,875 --> 00:41:48,375
And send away
for a mail-Order bride?

884
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:49,667
- N--
- Come here.

885
00:41:49,667 --> 00:41:52,041
- Actually...

886
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:54,959
turns out jen and i
are married.

887
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:59,625
Crazy, right?
How was chicago?

888
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:01,667
- This is--This is a--
A joke, right?

889
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:04,041
- No! We didn't get married.

890
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:06,500
This is a big mistake.
It just--It goes way back.

891
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,000
- Way back.

892
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,709
Yeah,
there's history here.

893
00:42:09,709 --> 00:42:12,667
History that you can't even
begin to understand.

894
00:42:12,667 --> 00:42:14,834
- Don't worry, bryce.
- Let me explain.

895
00:42:14,834 --> 00:42:17,959
See, jennifer and i
have what's called

896
00:42:17,959 --> 00:42:21,792
A "common-Law marriage."

897
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:22,792
- And you've been hiding this
from me?

898
00:42:22,792 --> 00:42:24,291
- No, no.

899
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,250
Kevin drudged up
this whole common law thing

900
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,625
And i had no idea,

901
00:42:27,625 --> 00:42:29,291
And i didn't think
that you would understand.

902
00:42:29,291 --> 00:42:30,458
- You're right, i don't.

903
00:42:30,458 --> 00:42:31,709
- Bryce,
it's just temporary, okay?

904
00:42:31,709 --> 00:42:34,125
I am going to handle
all of this--

905
00:42:34,125 --> 00:42:36,041
This whole thing soon enough.
- Well, you better.

906
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:39,083
You get rid of this parasite
or our wedding is off.

907
00:42:39,083 --> 00:42:44,083
Oh! And to answer your question,
chicago was great.

908
00:42:44,083 --> 00:42:46,333
- Oh.

909
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:06,458
- Sally?
- Hey, jen.

910
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:09,291
Okay, so i've been going over
this crazy common law claim

911
00:43:09,291 --> 00:43:10,834
With everyone
at the law firm,

912
00:43:10,834 --> 00:43:14,458
And it seems like you only have
a couple of options.

913
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:15,917
One, we can fight this
in court,

914
00:43:15,917 --> 00:43:18,333
And you can spend a lotta time
and a lotta money and maybe win.

915
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:20,000
But even if we do win,

916
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,458
You're not gonna get
to marry bryce anytime soon.

917
00:43:22,458 --> 00:43:24,041
Two, you can get kevin
to sign a document

918
00:43:24,041 --> 00:43:25,583
Waiving
any common law claim,

919
00:43:25,583 --> 00:43:27,875
Which he won't do
unless he has to,

920
00:43:27,875 --> 00:43:30,542
And doesn't have to
unless you make him.

921
00:43:30,542 --> 00:43:32,041
- Look.

922
00:43:32,041 --> 00:43:35,291
As great of a guy as kevin is,
he's always been a quitter.

923
00:43:35,291 --> 00:43:36,834
If you can make
kevin's life miserable

924
00:43:36,834 --> 00:43:38,250
For just a few hours,

925
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,208
Show him what it means
to be a real husband,

926
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:41,750
I think he'll crack
and sign anything.

927
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:43,375
- Oh, you think?
I don't know.

928
00:43:43,375 --> 00:43:45,792
- It'll take a day,
a week tops.

929
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:47,041
- I don't know.

930
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,583
- Honey,
this is the only option.

931
00:43:48,583 --> 00:43:50,375
In the end,
kevin'll thank you,

932
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:52,834
But you absolutely
cannot go soft.

933
00:43:52,834 --> 00:43:55,709
Trust me.
Kevin folds every time.

934
00:43:55,709 --> 00:43:57,625
- I hope so.

935
00:43:57,625 --> 00:43:58,875
- Okay,
i'll talk to you later.

936
00:43:58,875 --> 00:44:01,834
- Okay, bye.

937
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:11,041
- Ow!
- Good morning, sweetie pie.

938
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:12,458
Since you are my husband,

939
00:44:12,458 --> 00:44:15,208
Today you get to help me
do some husband-Y things.

940
00:44:15,208 --> 00:44:17,875
- Can we revisit this in,
like, four to six hours?

941
00:44:17,875 --> 00:44:20,250
- No, i'm sorry.
We have a household to run.

942
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:23,166
- I--No.

943
00:44:23,166 --> 00:44:25,083
Okay.

944
00:44:25,083 --> 00:44:26,417
- These are the bills.

945
00:44:26,417 --> 00:44:28,125
This is a mortgage
we need to refinance

946
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:29,417
To get better interest rates.

947
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:30,542
These are some brochures

948
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:31,667
So you can call
the various agents

949
00:44:31,667 --> 00:44:33,417
To evaluate
their re-Fi offer.

950
00:44:33,417 --> 00:44:34,917
These are charts
for life insurance.

951
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:38,291
- And here's a warranty
for the broken dishwasher.

952
00:44:38,291 --> 00:44:40,083
It may have expired.

953
00:44:40,083 --> 00:44:41,583
But you can handle all that,
right, honey?

954
00:44:41,583 --> 00:44:45,917
- Can i phone in
a lifeline, please?

955
00:44:50,917 --> 00:44:55,166
Hey, honey.

956
00:44:55,166 --> 00:44:57,333
Oh, so i just got done
mowing the lawn,

957
00:44:57,333 --> 00:44:59,959
Balancing the checkbook,
paying our bills,

958
00:44:59,959 --> 00:45:01,500
And i took it upon myself

959
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,000
To set up a sep-Ira for us.

960
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,333
- Okay, great.

961
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:06,834
Call the shop and see
when my car is gonna be ready.

962
00:45:06,834 --> 00:45:08,166
Then drop off
the dry-Cleaning.

963
00:45:08,166 --> 00:45:09,709
Then go to the neighborhood
association meeting.

964
00:45:09,709 --> 00:45:11,208
They need help
with the bake sale.

965
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,500
And there's
a few other things on here,

966
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,625
But don't worry.

967
00:45:13,625 --> 00:45:15,792
I made an hourly schedule
for you.

968
00:45:21,166 --> 00:45:23,583
- Jen...

969
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:26,458
do you want a husband,
a chauffeur,

970
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:28,041
Or a personal assistant?

971
00:45:28,041 --> 00:45:30,625
- Yes.

972
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:34,667
So you ready to throw in
the towel?

973
00:45:39,709 --> 00:45:43,083
Oh, actually...

974
00:45:43,083 --> 00:45:46,083
i'm ready to step up
my game.

975
00:46:31,834 --> 00:46:33,917
- So how are things
with kevin?

976
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:35,875
- He spent all last night
working on the gazebo.

977
00:46:35,875 --> 00:46:37,625
- Wow.

978
00:46:37,625 --> 00:46:39,875
That doesn't sound at all
like kevin.

979
00:46:39,875 --> 00:46:41,333
- I know.
I thought the same thing.

980
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:42,667
- I don't know,
you need to, like,

981
00:46:42,667 --> 00:46:45,667
Raise the stakes
or something.

982
00:46:47,709 --> 00:46:49,750
- What?
What's that?

983
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:51,709
- Oh, kevin?

984
00:46:51,709 --> 00:46:53,959
Sally and i have
a few errands to run

985
00:46:53,959 --> 00:46:57,208
And she's got the kids.

986
00:46:57,208 --> 00:47:00,417
You wouldn't mind babysitting
for us, would you?

987
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:07,166
- Actually,
i was gonna meet the guys,

988
00:47:07,166 --> 00:47:08,625
Shoot some hoops,
you know?

989
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:09,750
- Oh.

990
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:12,125
- Oh, that's too bad.
- Yeah.

991
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:15,083
- I mean, a husband has to have
natural fathering instincts.

992
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:17,750
- It's so important.
- Very important.

993
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:19,750
- It's, like,
the most important.

994
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:21,250
- The most important.

995
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:24,250
- Mm-Hmm.
- Mm.

996
00:47:25,625 --> 00:47:26,917
Hmm.

997
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:31,208
I'm just gonna--Just gonna
take this away from you.

998
00:47:31,208 --> 00:47:33,583
Let go.
Let go, let go, let go.

999
00:47:33,583 --> 00:47:36,417
Let go!

1000
00:47:36,417 --> 00:47:38,166
Sally says you're what happens
if i don't do well in school.

1001
00:47:38,166 --> 00:47:41,709
- Oh, yeah?

1002
00:47:41,709 --> 00:47:43,125
Du-Doy!

1003
00:47:43,125 --> 00:47:44,875
- Huh? Huh?

1004
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:46,458
You wanna fight dirty, huh?

1005
00:47:50,208 --> 00:47:54,917
- Â™ª don't follow me,
i could be wrong â™ª

1006
00:47:54,917 --> 00:47:59,000
Â™ª it's in the air,
soon i'll be gone â™ª

1007
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,333
Â™ª stuck here inside
these four stone walls â™ª

1008
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:07,583
Â™ª i'm leaving now
if i got to crawl â™ª

1009
00:48:07,583 --> 00:48:12,792
Â™ª i don't care what you do,
i don't care what you say â™ª

1010
00:48:12,792 --> 00:48:13,959
- With the nose on!
- Â™ª come friday night â™ª

1011
00:48:13,959 --> 00:48:17,500
Â™ª i'm miles away â™ª

1012
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:23,500
- Yeah! Come on!
Hit it again! Hyah!

1013
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,000
- Ya!
- Yeah!

1014
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,333
Now watch, listen,
and learn, huh?

1015
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
- Â™ª i'm gonna break out
tonight â™ª

1016
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,417
Â™ª you thought you'd get to me,
putting on the freeze â™ª

1017
00:48:41,417 --> 00:48:43,083
Â™ª you were mistaken â™ª

1018
00:48:43,083 --> 00:48:48,000
Â™ª i'm not down on my knees â™ª

1019
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,291
- Do you think
they killed him?

1020
00:48:51,291 --> 00:48:53,709
- I feel kinda bad,
but i'm also morbidly curious.

1021
00:48:53,709 --> 00:48:55,250
- Well, if there's one thing
those kids can do

1022
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:57,375
It is crush
someone's spirit.

1023
00:49:05,041 --> 00:49:06,417
- Thank you.
Thank you.

1024
00:49:06,417 --> 00:49:09,041
Thanks, you guys are too kind.

1025
00:49:09,041 --> 00:49:10,375
Thank you, thank you.

1026
00:49:10,375 --> 00:49:12,542
Thank you.
Thank you.

1027
00:49:22,917 --> 00:49:24,583
- Bryce, sweetheart,

1028
00:49:24,583 --> 00:49:27,208
Everything is moving ahead
just fine.

1029
00:49:27,208 --> 00:49:30,083
This kevin problem
will be solved shortly.

1030
00:49:30,083 --> 00:49:31,834
- Well, i hope so.

1031
00:49:31,834 --> 00:49:33,750
The von hoffman's asked us
to their anniversary reception

1032
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:35,083
This weekend at the club,

1033
00:49:35,083 --> 00:49:36,333
And when they said
"bring your fiancee,"

1034
00:49:36,333 --> 00:49:37,667
It was all i could do
not to blurt out,

1035
00:49:37,667 --> 00:49:38,750
"She married someone else."

1036
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,542
- I'm sorry, honey.

1037
00:49:40,542 --> 00:49:41,875
- Listen, babe, can we
just talk about this later?

1038
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:44,458
I'm really busy right now.

1039
00:49:44,458 --> 00:49:46,083
All right, bye.

1040
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:48,667
- Bye.

1041
00:49:58,208 --> 00:49:59,458
- Kev.

1042
00:49:59,458 --> 00:50:00,917
- Hey.

1043
00:50:00,917 --> 00:50:02,333
- You missed
another poker night.

1044
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:03,417
- Yeah.

1045
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,125
- Not to mention
basketball today.

1046
00:50:05,125 --> 00:50:07,417
- I know.
I'm--I'm sorry, man.

1047
00:50:07,417 --> 00:50:08,583
- What's happened to you?

1048
00:50:08,583 --> 00:50:10,542
You never wanna
hang out anymore.

1049
00:50:10,542 --> 00:50:12,750
- I got all these
responsibilities now, right?

1050
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,375
I got the bills.
I got the mortgage.

1051
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:16,208
I got the kids.
- Kids?

1052
00:50:16,208 --> 00:50:18,041
Ha, that was quick.

1053
00:50:18,041 --> 00:50:19,792
I think you're letting this
get to your head.

1054
00:50:19,792 --> 00:50:21,333
Why are you still at this?

1055
00:50:21,333 --> 00:50:22,750
- 'Cause i don't wanna
let her down.

1056
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:24,458
- You mean you don't want her
to marry bryce.

1057
00:50:24,458 --> 00:50:25,792
- Didn't i say that?

1058
00:50:25,792 --> 00:50:27,375
- No.

1059
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:30,166
- You know,
i just had this crazy idea.

1060
00:50:30,166 --> 00:50:32,458
With all this responsibility
flying around,

1061
00:50:32,458 --> 00:50:35,792
Maybe i should
put away childish things

1062
00:50:35,792 --> 00:50:36,959
And go back to school.

1063
00:50:36,959 --> 00:50:38,792
I only need
six more credits, right?

1064
00:50:38,792 --> 00:50:40,125
- There you go.

1065
00:50:40,125 --> 00:50:42,875
- I have been
a little off lately, huh?

1066
00:50:45,458 --> 00:50:47,875
Fell off the horse a bit.

1067
00:50:47,875 --> 00:50:50,125
- You didn't just fall off.

1068
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:52,208
That horse knocked you down,
stepped on your head,

1069
00:50:52,208 --> 00:50:55,542
And is off
eating dandelions.

1070
00:51:01,959 --> 00:51:06,625
- How's it going with kevin?
- Kevin!

1071
00:51:06,625 --> 00:51:09,166
Ha!

1072
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:11,625
Kevin...has lost weight...

1073
00:51:11,625 --> 00:51:14,000
he gets up at 5:00 a.M.
To do his chores.

1074
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,250
The kevin i know

1075
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:17,208
Would've never been able
to take all that.

1076
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:19,583
- Hang in there.
He's gonna crack soon.

1077
00:51:19,583 --> 00:51:20,750
He's got to.

1078
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,917
- Oh, it's kevin.

1079
00:51:25,917 --> 00:51:28,959
He's off work
and my chauffer for the day.

1080
00:51:44,291 --> 00:51:46,291
What?

1081
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,458
- Are you talking to me now?

1082
00:51:49,458 --> 00:51:52,542
- No, i'm still mad at you.

1083
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:55,542
But do you think
i look like a giant snowman?

1084
00:51:59,041 --> 00:52:01,959
You look, um...

1085
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,208
beautiful.

1086
00:52:10,542 --> 00:52:12,875
- Thanks.

1087
00:52:15,583 --> 00:52:16,875
- Um...

1088
00:52:16,875 --> 00:52:19,166
well...

1089
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:23,083
i'll be in the car,
milady.

1090
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:43,291
- You know, you'll be
in a men's shelter soon enough.

1091
00:52:44,917 --> 00:52:47,333
- Napoleon!

1092
00:52:47,333 --> 00:52:48,625
Napoleon!

1093
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:51,500
- Hey, you.

1094
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,917
Hi, sweetie.
- Hi!

1095
00:52:54,917 --> 00:52:56,875
- Looks like
he hasn't slept in days.

1096
00:52:56,875 --> 00:52:58,375
- Good work, hon.

1097
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:01,000
You finally tightened
the screws.

1098
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,250
- After everything
that's happened, i--

1099
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:06,375
I can't believe
you still wanna marry me.

1100
00:53:06,375 --> 00:53:08,792
- Sweetheart,
of course i do.

1101
00:53:08,792 --> 00:53:12,375
- I'm sorry. I really am.
About everything.

1102
00:53:12,375 --> 00:53:16,417
- Oh, i almost forgot.
I got you a little something.

1103
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:27,291
- Bryce!

1104
00:53:29,667 --> 00:53:31,375
It's beautiful.
Thank you.

1105
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:32,792
- You can wear it tonight
at the von hoffman's

1106
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:33,917
Anniversary party.

1107
00:53:33,917 --> 00:53:35,625
Mrs. Von hoffman
is head of my firm

1108
00:53:35,625 --> 00:53:37,000
And she adores you.

1109
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,291
I mean, can you blame her
for wanting me to show you off?

1110
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:45,625
I got some work to finish up,
and i will see you...

1111
00:53:45,625 --> 00:53:48,041
tonight at the party.
- Okay.

1112
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,834
- Yeah, this is kevin.

1113
00:54:11,834 --> 00:54:15,417
Wha--Are you serious?

1114
00:54:15,417 --> 00:54:18,166
Yeah! Yeah,
that's incredible. Yeah.

1115
00:54:18,166 --> 00:54:19,333
Okay!

1116
00:54:19,333 --> 00:54:22,000
Yeah, i'll--
I'll see you there.

1117
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,208
Great.

1118
00:54:23,208 --> 00:54:24,875
Bye.

1119
00:54:27,166 --> 00:54:29,458
All right.

1120
00:54:29,458 --> 00:54:30,834
- Kevin!

1121
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,166
Kevin!

1122
00:54:34,166 --> 00:54:35,417
Kevin?
Kevin?

1123
00:54:35,417 --> 00:54:36,583
- Jen, guess what.

1124
00:54:36,583 --> 00:54:38,083
You remember
that new york investor

1125
00:54:38,083 --> 00:54:39,333
That i was caddying for
last month,

1126
00:54:39,333 --> 00:54:41,333
Mr. Davidson?

1127
00:54:41,333 --> 00:54:44,083
Well, he's passing through town.
He wants to meet!

1128
00:54:44,083 --> 00:54:46,250
His kid loved my game idea!

1129
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,917
This is a once-In-Lifetime
opportunity.

1130
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:51,250
- Kevin, napoleon is sick
and he's not responding!

1131
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:53,208
- What?

1132
00:54:53,208 --> 00:54:54,917
Napoleon? What's wrong?

1133
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:58,208
- He was throwing up
and now he's just laying there.

1134
00:54:58,208 --> 00:55:02,375
I tried calling the vet,
but all i got was their service.

1135
00:55:04,792 --> 00:55:06,959
That's bryce.

1136
00:55:08,667 --> 00:55:10,667
- Hey, are you okay?

1137
00:55:10,667 --> 00:55:11,834
What's wrong?

1138
00:55:11,834 --> 00:55:13,792
- Hi! You got my message.

1139
00:55:13,792 --> 00:55:15,125
- Yeah, what's the verdict?

1140
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:16,417
- He's still sick.

1141
00:55:16,417 --> 00:55:18,083
He's just--
He's laying there.

1142
00:55:18,083 --> 00:55:20,166
I think we need to take him
to the vet.

1143
00:55:20,166 --> 00:55:21,667
- Jen, i feel terrible
about it,

1144
00:55:21,667 --> 00:55:23,000
But i'm trapped
between meetings all day.

1145
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,291
I'm sure he'll be fine.

1146
00:55:30,291 --> 00:55:32,083
Listen, babe, i gotta run,

1147
00:55:32,083 --> 00:55:33,458
But don't be
so worried about it.

1148
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:35,667
He's just a dog, jen.

1149
00:55:37,166 --> 00:55:39,375
- We gotta get him
to the vet.

1150
00:55:39,375 --> 00:55:40,792
- But your investor,
your big opportunity.

1151
00:55:40,792 --> 00:55:42,375
- Did i say that was today?
It's tomorrow, tomorrow.

1152
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:44,667
- Kevin,
is he gonna be okay?

1153
00:55:49,417 --> 00:55:52,750
- Napoleon had quite
an intestinal blockage,

1154
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:54,750
But...

1155
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:56,125
he's gonna be fine.

1156
00:55:56,125 --> 00:55:58,625
- Ooh-Wee.

1157
00:55:58,625 --> 00:56:02,291
- Oh, thank goodness.

1158
00:56:02,291 --> 00:56:05,375
That's one of bryce's
golf balls.

1159
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:11,542
- I'm really sorry
you missed

1160
00:56:11,542 --> 00:56:13,375
Your big meeting
with mr. Davidson.

1161
00:56:13,375 --> 00:56:15,709
- No, no--I'll have
more opportunities, you know?

1162
00:56:15,709 --> 00:56:17,458
We only have one napoleon.

1163
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:19,083
- Thanks, kev.

1164
00:56:19,083 --> 00:56:21,667
- Hey, hey.
Napoleon's gonna be fine.

1165
00:56:21,667 --> 00:56:24,375
- No, i know, i just got really
worried about the while thing.

1166
00:56:24,375 --> 00:56:25,709
Is my makeup--
Does it look okay?

1167
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:38,041
- Relax.

1168
00:56:38,041 --> 00:56:39,458
You look amazing.

1169
00:56:39,458 --> 00:56:41,291
- And you need
to get some rest, kevin.

1170
00:56:41,291 --> 00:56:42,667
You look exhausted.

1171
00:56:42,667 --> 00:56:45,375
- Get outta here
and go have fun with bryce.

1172
00:56:45,375 --> 00:56:46,834
- Okay.

1173
00:56:46,834 --> 00:56:48,792
Okay.

1174
00:56:48,792 --> 00:56:51,917
- A husband's there
when you need him.

1175
00:56:57,125 --> 00:56:59,834
- Excuse me.

1176
00:57:02,875 --> 00:57:05,500
You're late.
- I know. I'm sorry, okay?

1177
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,834
Napoleon. We took him.
He got sick.

1178
00:57:06,834 --> 00:57:08,542
And we had to go to the vet.
- Fill me in later.

1179
00:57:08,542 --> 00:57:10,542
- Are you angry?
- I'm not angry!

1180
00:57:10,542 --> 00:57:11,834
You're just
over an hour late.

1181
00:57:11,834 --> 00:57:13,250
- Bryce, i told you,
napoleon. He got--

1182
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:15,250
- I know, but we're at an ultra
critical time right now.

1183
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:16,625
The board meeting
is next month, jen,

1184
00:57:16,625 --> 00:57:19,750
And when they announce partner,
i'd like it to be me.

1185
00:57:21,166 --> 00:57:23,291
- Okay.

1186
00:57:23,291 --> 00:57:25,375
I'm sorry.

1187
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:28,250
I just, um--I've had a lot
on my mind lately.

1188
00:57:46,875 --> 00:57:49,583
- She's gonna need her purse.

1189
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,083
- Bryce.

1190
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:54,458
And the lovely jennifer.

1191
00:57:54,458 --> 00:57:57,083
- It's nice to see you again,
mrs. Von hoffman.

1192
00:57:57,083 --> 00:58:00,166
- I understand congratulations
are in order.

1193
00:58:00,166 --> 00:58:02,000
There's a wedding coming up,
isn't there?

1194
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,625
- Yes, it is.
- Mm-Hmm.

1195
00:58:03,625 --> 00:58:06,333
Jennifer, i understand
you work for monroy and klein.

1196
00:58:06,333 --> 00:58:07,458
- Yes, i work--

1197
00:58:07,458 --> 00:58:09,083

1198
00:58:09,083 --> 00:58:10,792
- Does she?

1199
00:58:10,792 --> 00:58:11,750
- Yes.

1200
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:13,625
- You must be very talented.

1201
00:58:13,625 --> 00:58:14,917
- Thank you.

1202
00:58:14,917 --> 00:58:17,041
- Bryce,
you're a lucky man.

1203
00:58:17,041 --> 00:58:18,417
- Let me refresh that
for you.

1204
00:58:18,417 --> 00:58:20,625
- Yes, and would you please
ask them to uncork

1205
00:58:20,625 --> 00:58:21,959
A decent bottle this time?

1206
00:58:21,959 --> 00:58:25,083
- Absolutely.

1207
00:58:25,083 --> 00:58:26,792
- So you're getting married.

1208
00:58:26,792 --> 00:58:29,500
Lucky girl.

1209
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,583
You've got your whole life
ahead of you.

1210
00:58:31,583 --> 00:58:33,458
- Yes, me and bryce,

1211
00:58:33,458 --> 00:58:37,083
Uh, we're really excited
about the whole thing.

1212
00:58:37,083 --> 00:58:38,959
- I wish you the best,

1213
00:58:38,959 --> 00:58:42,041
And if bryce
steps out of line...

1214
00:58:42,041 --> 00:58:43,375
you let me know.

1215
00:58:43,375 --> 00:58:45,500
- Yes, i will.

1216
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,041
- Ladies.

1217
00:58:47,041 --> 00:58:50,625

00:58:50,625 --> 00:58:52,041
Cheers.

1219
00:58:52,041 --> 00:58:55,583
- Cheers.

1220
00:58:55,583 --> 00:58:57,458
- It was lovely
talking with you.

1221
00:58:57,458 --> 00:58:59,625
- Likewise.

1222
00:59:03,125 --> 00:59:04,709
- Did you have a nice talk?
Did she say anything about me?

1223
00:59:04,709 --> 00:59:07,583
- No, not really.

1224
00:59:07,583 --> 00:59:09,625
- Jenkins.

1225
00:59:12,625 --> 00:59:14,041
- I'll be a sec.

1226
00:59:17,542 --> 00:59:18,750
- I'll have another one,
please.

1227
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:20,542
- Hey, jen.

1228
00:59:20,542 --> 00:59:21,834
- Kev!
- Hi.

1229
00:59:21,834 --> 00:59:24,166
- What are you doing here?
- You forgot your purse.

1230
00:59:24,166 --> 00:59:25,333
- Thank you.

1231
00:59:25,333 --> 00:59:26,959
- What are you doing here?

1232
00:59:26,959 --> 00:59:29,750
- Jennifer forgot her purse,
but don't worry,

1233
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:31,667
I'm leaving.

1234
00:59:33,959 --> 00:59:35,500
You know what?
- Kev, please.

1235
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:36,875
- I gotta say something.

1236
00:59:36,875 --> 00:59:40,166
Jennifer here
is a diamond.

1237
00:59:40,166 --> 00:59:43,333
And you're treating her
like a rhinestone.

1238
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:46,542
- Jennifer, get rid of him,
please.

1239
00:59:46,542 --> 00:59:49,250
- Don't talk to her
that way.

1240
00:59:54,834 --> 00:59:56,041
Hey, kev.
- Mm-Hmm.

1241
00:59:56,041 --> 00:59:57,500
- Why don't we
continue this inside?

1242
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:00,125
- Sure, bry.

1243
01:00:05,083 --> 01:00:07,041
- I've had just about enough
of you and all of your antics

1244
01:00:07,041 --> 01:00:08,542
And everything that--
- Yeah, well, that's funny,

1245
01:00:08,542 --> 01:00:09,750
'Cause i've been sick
of you too.

1246
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:11,041
- Now, stop, you guys.
This is ridiculous.

1247
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:12,458
- Yeah, it is ridiculous

1248
01:00:12,458 --> 01:00:13,792
The way this nutjob's
turned our life upside down.

1249
01:00:13,792 --> 01:00:15,166
- Well, at least
i'm not a two-Faced creep.

1250
01:00:15,166 --> 01:00:17,250
- That's it!
- Bryce, no!

1251
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:19,000
- Oh, he sucker punched me!

1252
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,709
- Bryce!

1253
01:00:20,709 --> 01:00:22,000
- You know what?
You win.

1254
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,166
I mean, this is--

1255
01:00:23,166 --> 01:00:24,750
Aah!

1256
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:27,083
- Bryce, stop!
- Hey, break it up!

1257
01:00:27,083 --> 01:00:28,458
- Kevin!
- Break it up!

1258
01:00:31,917 --> 01:00:33,375
- Oh, bryce!
- Stay back!

1259
01:00:33,375 --> 01:00:35,417
- I--He hit me.

1260
01:00:35,417 --> 01:00:37,375
- Bryce, are you okay?

1261
01:00:41,041 --> 01:00:44,083
- Is he dead?

1262
01:00:56,834 --> 01:00:59,709
- Kevin.

1263
01:01:13,709 --> 01:01:17,125
- Hey.

1264
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:28,375
Yeah, about how things
went down, um...

1265
01:01:32,208 --> 01:01:34,500
i'm sorry.

1266
01:01:43,709 --> 01:01:45,792
- Kev.

1267
01:02:06,959 --> 01:02:08,625
Come here.

1268
01:02:08,625 --> 01:02:11,125
- Ooh. Ah. Ooh.
Okay, okay.

1269
01:02:13,417 --> 01:02:15,709
- Well,
you're enjoying this.

1270
01:02:15,709 --> 01:02:18,959
- Oh, so what if i am?

1271
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:26,875
- Come on.

1272
01:02:26,875 --> 01:02:29,709
We've had fun
over the years, right?

1273
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:36,667
You're my best friend, jen.

1274
01:02:46,792 --> 01:02:49,250
- Kev...

1275
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:52,667
why put yourself through
all of this?

1276
01:02:54,959 --> 01:02:58,000
- 'Cause you're worth it.

1277
01:03:02,542 --> 01:03:06,750
And...

1278
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:08,417
i think i'm falling
in love with you.

1279
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:10,875
- Kevin.

1280
01:03:10,875 --> 01:03:16,166
- And i don't--
I don't know what to do.

1281
01:03:19,208 --> 01:03:22,083
- You've been my best friend
since we were six.

1282
01:03:25,542 --> 01:03:29,542
- But bryce, he's the one
that i'm supposed to marry.

1283
01:03:45,583 --> 01:03:49,000
Good night, kevin.

1284
01:03:54,709 --> 01:03:58,083
- Jen.

1285
01:03:58,083 --> 01:04:01,291
I'll sign whatever you want
in the morning.

1286
01:04:40,875 --> 01:04:43,000
- All right,
so just sign here

1287
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,041
And then initial down there.

1288
01:04:46,041 --> 01:04:49,583
You see, jeremy, this is called
signing a document.

1289
01:04:49,583 --> 01:04:52,125
It's what real lawyers do
to actually help their clients.

1290
01:04:52,125 --> 01:04:54,792
We do it with a pen.

1291
01:04:54,792 --> 01:04:57,834
And then finally,
this last one.

1292
01:05:11,875 --> 01:05:14,667
And that's it.

1293
01:05:14,667 --> 01:05:16,166
Congratulations.

1294
01:05:16,166 --> 01:05:18,667
You are both
officially not married,

1295
01:05:18,667 --> 01:05:21,834
Not that you ever actually were
in the first place.

1296
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:24,250
Okay.

1297
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:27,041
- So that's it then.

1298
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:31,083
- I guess so.

1299
01:05:31,083 --> 01:05:32,583
- Well...

1300
01:05:32,583 --> 01:05:37,417
there's also the little matter
of property to be returned.

1301
01:05:37,417 --> 01:05:38,542
Ring.

1302
01:05:38,542 --> 01:05:40,792
- Oh.

1303
01:06:32,291 --> 01:06:35,792
- Jen?

1304
01:06:35,792 --> 01:06:40,041
I wish you and bryce

1305
01:06:40,041 --> 01:06:43,083
All the luck
in the world.

1306
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:46,834
- You too.

1307
01:07:04,834 --> 01:07:07,625
- Jennifer,

1308
01:07:07,625 --> 01:07:10,333
Sorry for losing it
the other day.

1309
01:07:10,333 --> 01:07:13,500
You forgive me?

1310
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:17,458
- Well, let's just say
it was less than an optimal time

1311
01:07:17,458 --> 01:07:18,750
For the both of us.

1312
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:20,959
- You know, i had time
to think about priorities...

1313
01:07:22,083 --> 01:07:25,458
and i realized
how much you mean to me.

1314
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:28,625
Well, it's done.

1315
01:07:28,625 --> 01:07:29,959
Signed, sealed, delivered.

1316
01:07:29,959 --> 01:07:32,291
And now we can finally
focus on our wedding.

1317
01:07:32,291 --> 01:07:34,291
- What--What do you
keep doing?

1318
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:39,542
- It's just weird,

1319
01:07:39,542 --> 01:07:43,166
Not having kevin's
big, ugly ring on my finger.

1320
01:07:43,166 --> 01:07:45,500
- Hm.

1321
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:49,542
- But your ring
is the only ring

1322
01:07:49,542 --> 01:07:52,208
That i need.

1323
01:07:54,834 --> 01:07:57,250
- And that's what
i like to hear.

1324
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:59,375
- Oh.

1325
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:01,333
- Come on.

1326
01:08:11,667 --> 01:08:15,834
- Â™ª in case
you didn't notice â™ª

1327
01:08:15,834 --> 01:08:20,250
- Single again, man,
drink up.

1328
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:23,166
Those girls over there
are checking us out.

1329
01:08:23,166 --> 01:08:25,834
Yeah.

1330
01:08:27,208 --> 01:08:28,875
You guys go talk to 'em.

1331
01:08:28,875 --> 01:08:30,291
- No, no, no.
Hey, look.

1332
01:08:30,291 --> 01:08:31,500
You just gotta regroup.

1333
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:32,792
You gotta get
back in the game.

1334
01:08:32,792 --> 01:08:35,667
- Yeah, kev,
get out of this funk.

1335
01:08:35,667 --> 01:08:39,959
- I'm contemplating
my next move.

1336
01:08:39,959 --> 01:08:41,667
- You still serious
about going back to school?

1337
01:08:41,667 --> 01:08:42,875
- Yeah, i wanna
try something new.

1338
01:08:42,875 --> 01:08:44,291
I just--

1339
01:08:44,291 --> 01:08:45,709
Ah, man, my notebook.

1340
01:08:45,709 --> 01:08:48,583
- What?

1341
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:50,375
- It's my big book
of my best game ideas.

1342
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:51,834
I left it at jennifer's.

1343
01:08:51,834 --> 01:08:53,500
- Well, so go get it.

1344
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:55,250
- I'm not exactly
welcome there anymore.

1345
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:56,500
- Hm.

1346
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:58,500
- Mm.

1347
01:08:59,667 --> 01:09:03,041
- I don't suppose
maybe you could--

1348
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,375
- Sure.
I'll swing by and get it.

1349
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:09,291
- Thank you.

1350
01:09:11,125 --> 01:09:13,000
- And you--And you talked
to the bartenders?

1351
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,250
- Mm-Hmm. Yeah.
I made sure

1352
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:16,583
All the no-Name brands
were banned from the bar.

1353
01:09:16,583 --> 01:09:18,917
And the von hoffmans,
they rsvp'd.

1354
01:09:18,917 --> 01:09:20,083
- Perfect.

1355
01:09:20,083 --> 01:09:21,417
- It's gonna be
the wedding reception

1356
01:09:21,417 --> 01:09:24,208
To end all
wedding receptions.

1357
01:09:24,208 --> 01:09:26,166
Though, honey?

1358
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:28,625
Honey?
- Hm?

1359
01:09:28,625 --> 01:09:31,208
- I don't really know
a lot of the names on this list.

1360
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:34,041
- Uh, partners at the firm,
just clients.

1361
01:09:34,041 --> 01:09:35,291
Think of 'em
as aunts and uncles

1362
01:09:35,291 --> 01:09:37,166
You haven't met yet.

1363
01:09:37,166 --> 01:09:39,000
- Okay.

1364
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,083
Well, if you want
them there,

1365
01:09:40,083 --> 01:09:42,750
Then, yeah,
that's good for me.

1366
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:44,333
- Jen, you're amazing.

1367
01:09:44,333 --> 01:09:47,333
- Mm. I just want it
to be all perfect.

1368
01:09:48,917 --> 01:09:50,250
So do you wanna
come inside?

1369
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:53,041
We can relax.
We can watch a movie.

1370
01:09:53,041 --> 01:09:55,458
- Ah, i would love to,
sweetheart, but i'm crazed.

1371
01:09:55,458 --> 01:09:59,291
Johnson just made a play
for the morewood tech account.

1372
01:09:59,291 --> 01:10:02,000
I gotta go, okay?

1373
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
- Okay.

1374
01:10:05,083 --> 01:10:06,375
- I love you.

1375
01:10:06,375 --> 01:10:07,792
Bye.

1376
01:10:07,792 --> 01:10:10,208
Love you.

1377
01:10:21,875 --> 01:10:23,875
- Kevin?

1378
01:10:25,291 --> 01:10:28,041
I'm h-Home.

1379
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:31,792
Hey, napoleon.

1380
01:10:31,792 --> 01:10:34,834
It's just you and me now.

1381
01:11:22,250 --> 01:11:24,625
Change your mind
about the movie?

1382
01:11:28,166 --> 01:11:30,667
- Hi.
- Hi.

1383
01:11:30,667 --> 01:11:32,125
Sorry,
i thought you were bryce.

1384
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:34,834
- Nope, just me.

1385
01:11:34,834 --> 01:11:35,959
- Come on in.

1386
01:11:35,959 --> 01:11:38,000
- Thanks.

1387
01:11:42,875 --> 01:11:45,792
So, kevin forgot
his idea book.

1388
01:11:45,792 --> 01:11:47,041
- Oh.

1389
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:48,792
I know exactly
where that is.

1390
01:11:48,792 --> 01:11:50,208
I wouldn't want
kevin to lose that.

1391
01:11:50,208 --> 01:11:53,625
That would be like da vinci
losing his sketches.

1392
01:11:57,375 --> 01:11:59,083
- Here it is.

1393
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:09,500
Hey, it's a menu
from waffle habit.

1394
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:12,667
Kevin and i practically
lived there during college.

1395
01:12:12,667 --> 01:12:14,667
- They had
the best belgian waffles.

1396
01:12:14,667 --> 01:12:17,458
Do you know they closed down
last year?

1397
01:12:19,667 --> 01:12:21,333
- Yeah.

1398
01:12:21,333 --> 01:12:23,417
Miss that place.

1399
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:28,458
What is it that kevin--

1400
01:12:28,458 --> 01:12:29,917
Used to always say?

1401
01:12:29,917 --> 01:12:32,458
He would say,

1402
01:12:32,458 --> 01:12:35,166
"Don't rush through life.

1403
01:12:35,166 --> 01:12:38,166
Stop and--"
Both: "smell the waffles."

1404
01:12:47,083 --> 01:12:52,083
We had some great times
together, him and i.

1405
01:12:52,083 --> 01:12:55,291
- I mean,
that's my brother, right?

1406
01:12:57,583 --> 01:13:01,500
- The guy who saved
your slinky.

1407
01:13:02,625 --> 01:13:05,625
Good night, jen.

1408
01:13:06,875 --> 01:13:08,583
- Good night.

1409
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:20,917
- Can you believe it?

1410
01:13:20,917 --> 01:13:23,166
The day before your wedding.

1411
01:13:23,166 --> 01:13:24,625
- We made it through
this mess.

1412
01:13:24,625 --> 01:13:26,542
And now here we are
at the rehearsal.

1413
01:13:26,542 --> 01:13:29,375
- Ugh, finally.
Both: cheers.

1414
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:31,750
- You look stunning.

1415
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:33,667
- Mm. Thanks.
- Hey.

1416
01:13:33,667 --> 01:13:34,875
Babe?
- Oh, yeah?

1417
01:13:34,875 --> 01:13:36,250
- Did you see
the seating chart

1418
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:37,667
For the reception tomorrow?
- Mm-Hmm.

1419
01:13:37,667 --> 01:13:39,875
- The hatchers and daltons
are seated at the same table.

1420
01:13:39,875 --> 01:13:41,625
- Is that a problem?

1421
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:43,500
- Uh, jen, i told you.

1422
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:44,959
They can't
sit near each other.

1423
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:46,500
Hatcher had dalton
tossed off his board.

1424
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:48,291
- Oh, i thought
it was peterson.

1425
01:13:48,291 --> 01:13:49,500
Oh, okay.

1426
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:51,000
Then we'll just move them
to table two.

1427
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,125
- Well, table two
has the chens,

1428
01:13:52,125 --> 01:13:53,333
Hatcher's
biggest competitor.

1429
01:13:53,333 --> 01:13:56,000
Didn't you double-Check this
with my office?

1430
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,500
- Honey,
i-I didn't have time.

1431
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,291
I had the dress fitting
and then,

1432
01:13:59,291 --> 01:14:01,125
We had trouble with the flowers,
that whole problem--

1433
01:14:01,125 --> 01:14:02,500
- It's okay.
I'll patch it up with hatcher

1434
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,750
When i see him in chicago.

1435
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:06,875
- You're going
to chicago again?

1436
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:08,000
- Yeah, i've got to.

1437
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,000
It'll just be
a couple days next week.

1438
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:17,667
Jen, we're talking
partnership here.

1439
01:14:17,667 --> 01:14:22,500
- Our partnership
or your partnership, bryce?

1440
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,542
- You know
that isn't fair.

1441
01:14:29,542 --> 01:14:31,709
- I'm sorry, okay? I just--
- No, look.

1442
01:14:31,709 --> 01:14:32,750
You got a lot
on your plate.

1443
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:35,083
I'll handle
the seating chart.

1444
01:14:35,083 --> 01:14:37,000
- Jennifer, dear?

1445
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,333
If you're ready,
it's time for the rehearsal.

1446
01:14:39,333 --> 01:14:40,875
Hm?

1447
01:14:44,041 --> 01:14:47,333
- Hey, he's just jittery,
okay?

1448
01:14:47,333 --> 01:14:50,333
- Isn't the bride supposed
to be the jittery one?

1449
01:14:56,917 --> 01:14:59,917
- So, we'll just
do a quick run-Through

1450
01:14:59,917 --> 01:15:02,417
And then you can
go enjoy the dinner.

1451
01:15:02,417 --> 01:15:05,417
You two aren't, uh,
nervous, i hope?

1452
01:15:05,417 --> 01:15:08,333
- Walk in the park,
right, honey?

1453
01:15:08,333 --> 01:15:12,000
- Well, then let's
get started.

1454
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,250
Jennifer, i trust
the rings are ready.

1455
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:15,458
- Yeah,

1456
01:15:15,458 --> 01:15:17,500
But it might
weigh her arm down.

1457
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:18,917
Like her engagement ring?

1458
01:15:18,917 --> 01:15:21,750
Biggest rock
at the jewelers.

1459
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:25,709
- Jewelers?

1460
01:15:25,709 --> 01:15:30,166
Bryce, i thought you said
this engagement ring was--

1461
01:15:30,166 --> 01:15:33,166
Was your grandmother's.

1462
01:15:35,333 --> 01:15:36,542
- What? I--

1463
01:15:36,542 --> 01:15:38,166
- Bryce, you said it.

1464
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:40,834
This engagement ring?

1465
01:15:40,834 --> 01:15:43,417
You said that
your grandfather

1466
01:15:43,417 --> 01:15:45,333
Carried it across
two continents,

1467
01:15:45,333 --> 01:15:47,166
And he would've gone further
for the woman that he loved.

1468
01:15:47,166 --> 01:15:48,250
You said that to me.

1469
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:49,417
I know you said that to me.
- Honey.

1470
01:15:49,417 --> 01:15:51,083
I took a look
at my grandmother's ring

1471
01:15:51,083 --> 01:15:53,917
And the diamonds were
just chintzy little chips.

1472
01:15:53,917 --> 01:15:56,458
You deserve something
more impressive.

1473
01:15:56,458 --> 01:15:59,583
- As impressive
as the story you told?

1474
01:15:59,583 --> 01:16:00,875
- Okay, honey,
can we not do this right now?

1475
01:16:00,875 --> 01:16:01,959
- So, if you're both ready,

1476
01:16:01,959 --> 01:16:03,291
We'll just do
a brief run-Through

1477
01:16:03,291 --> 01:16:04,917
Of how things
will go tomorrow.

1478
01:16:04,917 --> 01:16:07,041
Hm?

1479
01:16:07,041 --> 01:16:09,083
Everything okay?

1480
01:16:11,583 --> 01:16:14,667
- Jennifer?

1481
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,458
- Like the good book says,

1482
01:16:17,458 --> 01:16:20,208
Someone with a merry heart
does good like medicine.

1483
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:23,208
Know anyone like that?

1484
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:31,041
- Actually, i do.

1485
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:41,000
- Hey, thank you very much.

1486
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,083
Hey, what's going on?
- Hello, bryce.

1487
01:16:42,083 --> 01:16:43,500
- Thank you for coming.
Pleasure.

1488
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:44,959
And you know jennifer?

1489
01:16:44,959 --> 01:16:46,250
Exactly. Of course.

1490
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:49,041
- That's right, cheers.

1491
01:16:49,041 --> 01:16:51,041
- Bryce,
who are all these people?

1492
01:16:51,041 --> 01:16:53,709
I feel like i don't
even know any of them.

1493
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:54,917
- Just partners at the firm

1494
01:16:54,917 --> 01:16:55,917
Who can't make
the wedding tomorrow.

1495
01:16:55,917 --> 01:16:57,208
It's fine.

1496
01:16:57,208 --> 01:16:59,000
And henri really outdid himself
on the menu.

1497
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,917
It's gonna be amazing.

1498
01:17:02,208 --> 01:17:03,375
- Bryce?

1499
01:17:03,375 --> 01:17:05,291
- Hm?

1500
01:17:07,208 --> 01:17:09,041
- What's my favorite color?

1501
01:17:09,041 --> 01:17:11,333
- What?

1502
01:17:11,333 --> 01:17:13,208
- What is my favorite color?

1503
01:17:13,208 --> 01:17:15,041
- All right, bryce!

1504
01:17:15,041 --> 01:17:17,375
- Ugh, i-I don't know.
Blue?

1505
01:17:17,375 --> 01:17:18,625
No, yellow.

1506
01:17:18,625 --> 01:17:22,000
What does it matter?

1507
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,000
- For your information,
it's green.

1508
01:17:28,208 --> 01:17:31,250
- Hey, can we not
do this right now?

1509
01:17:40,917 --> 01:17:44,291
- I'm sorry.

1510
01:17:44,291 --> 01:17:46,291
- For what?

1511
01:17:55,667 --> 01:17:56,917
- Jennifer,
what are you doing?

1512
01:17:56,917 --> 01:17:59,917
- Something
i should've done ages ago.

1513
01:18:08,125 --> 01:18:11,125
Third and main, please.

1514
01:18:26,333 --> 01:18:27,667
Jeremy, is kevin here?

1515
01:18:27,667 --> 01:18:28,750
I need to find him.

1516
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:30,166
- Uh, he left.

1517
01:18:30,166 --> 01:18:32,375
He's going back to school.
- Where is he?

1518
01:18:32,375 --> 01:18:34,041
- He's at the bus station.

1519
01:18:34,041 --> 01:18:35,291
Jen?

1520
01:18:35,291 --> 01:18:37,291
Jen, wait!

1521
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:47,208
- Kevin!

1522
01:18:49,583 --> 01:18:51,625
No.

1523
01:19:21,375 --> 01:19:23,375
Jen?

1524
01:19:27,333 --> 01:19:30,208
- What are you
doing here?

1525
01:19:30,208 --> 01:19:34,625
- I-I heard you
were going away to school.

1526
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:39,542
- Yeah, i, uh,

1527
01:19:39,542 --> 01:19:43,709
Thought i might
finish my degree.

1528
01:19:43,709 --> 01:19:46,709
- Without saying
good-Bye to me?

1529
01:19:48,625 --> 01:19:51,208
- That's a local bus.

1530
01:19:53,041 --> 01:19:55,917
I'm going to college
downtown.

1531
01:19:57,709 --> 01:19:59,083
Of course.

1532
01:19:59,083 --> 01:20:01,250
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1533
01:20:06,208 --> 01:20:10,834
- Kevin, um...

1534
01:20:10,834 --> 01:20:12,333
i am so sorry.

1535
01:20:12,333 --> 01:20:14,917
I'm sorry for putting you
through the wringer,

1536
01:20:14,917 --> 01:20:18,250
Even though you did
deserve it sometimes.

1537
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:20,917
- I'm sorry too, i--

1538
01:20:20,917 --> 01:20:24,792
- But, even when i was--

1539
01:20:24,792 --> 01:20:27,750
I was trying to make
you miserable this whole time,

1540
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:33,250
You just kept on
making me happy.

1541
01:20:40,917 --> 01:20:43,250
- So--

1542
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:46,125
So what are you--
What are you saying?

1543
01:20:48,417 --> 01:20:51,417
- I'm saying...

1544
01:20:53,417 --> 01:20:55,417
this.

1545
01:21:04,417 --> 01:21:06,291
- Mmm. Mm-Hmm.

1546
01:21:10,041 --> 01:21:13,041
- I love you.

1547
01:21:18,125 --> 01:21:20,959
- Will you marry me?

1548
01:21:25,625 --> 01:21:29,291
- Probably.
- Oh.

1549
01:21:29,291 --> 01:21:31,291
"Probably."

1550
01:21:38,291 --> 01:21:40,583
- Thank you.
I'll see you guys soon.

1551
01:21:40,583 --> 01:21:43,625
Thank you for coming.

1552
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,667
- Wow.

1553
01:21:49,667 --> 01:21:52,250
You look great.

1554
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:54,875
- I do, don't i?

1555
01:21:54,875 --> 01:21:56,834
- Mm-Hmm.

1556
01:21:56,834 --> 01:21:58,166
- Hey!

1557
01:21:58,166 --> 01:21:59,667
- Mr. D, you made it.

1558
01:21:59,667 --> 01:22:01,667
- I know you're not
my caddy anymore...

1559
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:03,125
- well--
- But if i'm going

1560
01:22:03,125 --> 01:22:05,041
To invest in someone's idea,

1561
01:22:05,041 --> 01:22:07,458
I darn well better
be invited to the wedding.

1562
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:10,625
- I wanna see
that game of yours

1563
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:12,500
In the stores by christmas.

1564
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:14,500
- Okay.

1565
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:18,750
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

1566
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,875
- I cannot believe that
you of all people

1567
01:22:21,875 --> 01:22:24,375
Are actually succeeding
at something.

1568
01:22:24,375 --> 01:22:26,375
It's infuriating.

1569
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:33,333
Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1570
01:22:33,333 --> 01:22:35,417
You guys
are doing all right.

1571
01:22:35,417 --> 01:22:37,417
- Yeah, since we decided
to go into practice together,

1572
01:22:37,417 --> 01:22:38,709
Business is up.

1573
01:22:38,709 --> 01:22:41,333
Admit it.
- I admit it.

1574
01:22:41,333 --> 01:22:42,917
With my
courtroom experience...

1575
01:22:42,917 --> 01:22:44,709
- and my environmental
street cred.

1576
01:22:44,709 --> 01:22:45,875
- Oh, right.

1577
01:22:45,875 --> 01:22:47,875
- Our billable hours
are up 12%--

1578
01:22:47,875 --> 01:22:50,041
As long as your clients don't
try to pay in banana bread.

1579
01:22:50,041 --> 01:22:51,291
- Don't mock the clients.

1580
01:22:51,291 --> 01:22:52,917
They're very committed
people.

1581
01:22:52,917 --> 01:22:56,792
- Yeah, well,
i've got car payments.

1582
01:22:56,792 --> 01:22:58,041
Good luck.

1583
01:23:02,291 --> 01:23:04,083
- Well.
- Well.

1584
01:23:08,375 --> 01:23:10,750
The first seven years, kev,
they were just practice.

1585
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:12,166
- Right.

1586
01:23:12,166 --> 01:23:13,417
- The next seven...

1587
01:23:13,417 --> 01:23:15,750
- mm-Hmm.

1588
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:18,834
- We'll get it right.

1589
01:23:18,834 --> 01:23:20,542
- Yeah.

1590
01:23:20,542 --> 01:23:22,083
- Oh, yeah.

1591
01:23:22,083 --> 01:23:23,667
Oh, yeah.

1592
01:23:23,667 --> 01:23:25,583
- I now pronounce you
man and wife.

1593
01:23:25,583 --> 01:23:28,583
You may kiss the bride.

1594
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:06,000
- Thank you.
