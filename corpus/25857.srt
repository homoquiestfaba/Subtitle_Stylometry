1
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,204
Turn it up.

2
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:05,843
Dang.

3
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:09,678
That's what I'm talking about. L.A.!

4
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:23,121
Radio station l.D.

5
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:25,758
Coming to work. Joe Dirté.

6
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:29,359
Don't try and church it up, son.
Don't you mean Joe Dirt?

7
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:32,527
Naming you that, your daddy
must have really hated you.

8
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:34,208
You're wrong, brother.

9
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:36,365
I got a good name
for this car: Rusty.

10
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:38,960
-Shit'll buff out.
-Don't bother.

11
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:42,326
Drive this piece of crap off a cliff.
Do us all a favor.

12
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:45,279
This look like a piece of crap
to you?!

13
00:01:46,089 --> 00:01:47,886
You like them spinning tires?

14
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,401
-You suck!
-You do!

15
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:02,041
Did he hurt you, baby?

16
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:09,285
People like that security guard
don't really mean what they say.

17
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:11,639
They just got their own issues.

18
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:14,124
All's I got to do is keep
being a good person.

19
00:02:14,329 --> 00:02:16,968
No matter what,
good things'll come my way.

20
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:21,242
Everything will happen for me, as long
as I never have " no" in my heart.

21
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:24,998
Can't a guy even take a dump
in peace? Psycho.

22
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:27,325
-Fucking cocksucker.
-Right on.

23
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:29,447
Things are going to happen for me.

24
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:30,958
I'm Joe Dirt!

25
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:38,479
I'm going to the restroom
to take a big Joe.

26
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:40,839
Don't forget to wipe your dirt.

27
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:44,241
You boys got something to say?

28
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:47,885
Why don't you talk in the microphone?
I got a backup mike right here.

29
00:02:48,089 --> 00:02:50,080
Check, one, two. Testing, testing.

30
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:53,486
They both work and they don't
like no feedback. What's up?

31
00:02:57,769 --> 00:02:59,487
What's going on? Keep it down.

32
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:04,046
Zander Kelly's on the air.
What's the deal with your haircut?

33
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:08,083
I'm sorry about the noise, sir.
This ain't no haircut. This is a wig.

34
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:10,245
A wig.... Look at you.

35
00:03:10,449 --> 00:03:11,404
Jesus!

36
00:03:12,249 --> 00:03:15,047
I got somebody I want you to meet.
Come with me.

37
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:16,837
Come on back.

38
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:21,445
This is Zander Kelly.
You're listening to 98. 6, KXLA.

39
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:25,398
All-aberration radio, all the time.

40
00:03:25,649 --> 00:03:27,879
Zander. You got to see this guy.

41
00:03:28,089 --> 00:03:31,638
God almighty! Manna from
inbred heaven. Hey, freak-boy.

42
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:34,317
1 976 called.
It wants its hairstyle back.

43
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:35,968
Zander, get this: This is a wig.

44
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:40,606
What are you wearing a wig for? You
doing stunt work for Billy Ray Cyrus?

45
00:03:40,809 --> 00:03:43,562
Freddy, go get " Free Bird"-boy here
an all-access laminate...

46
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:46,886
...for the show in perpetuity. I'm
wringing this chamois as long as I can.

47
00:03:47,089 --> 00:03:50,968
You are exquisitely pathetic.
What's your name, pal?

48
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:54,559
Joe Dirt, but if you're just gonna make
fun of me, I'll go back to mopping.

49
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:56,441
Sit down. Let me take another tact.

50
00:03:56,649 --> 00:04:00,085
Mr. Dirt, what's with the wig?

51
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:02,839
I was born without the top of my skull.

52
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:06,246
A little bit of my brains was showing,
grossing everybody out.

53
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:09,608
So my mom put this wig on me
to cover it up...

54
00:04:09,809 --> 00:04:11,401
...and then the bones grew together...

55
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:14,923
...and it got all infused and entwined.

56
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,404
I don't mean to get all scientific
or whatever.

57
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,560
Why didn't your mom
change the wig later?

58
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,524
Actually, we got separated
when I was eight. I got lost.

59
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:26,799
You been on your own
since eight years old?

60
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:29,125
Pretty much.
It's a long story, actually.

61
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:30,284
Listen to you.

62
00:04:30,489 --> 00:04:33,162
What's the story here?
" I'm a white-trash idiot." The end.

63
00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:37,078
Is this where you want to be when Jesus
comes back, making fun of Joe Dirt?

64
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:39,883
Probably, because I'm sure Yahweh
would be chiming in too.

65
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:43,289
Funny, because my mom used to say that
if she caught me doing stuff.

66
00:04:43,489 --> 00:04:46,686
Like one time, I was jerking
my gherkin.... Can I say that?

67
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:49,357
She goes, " Is this where you want
to be when Jesus comes back?"

68
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,886
A real winner. It's amazing to me
you turned out like you did...

69
00:04:53,089 --> 00:04:55,239
...with that sort of mentoring.

70
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:56,962
I can't say don't make fun of me...

71
00:04:57,169 --> 00:04:58,602
...but you shouldn't make fun
of my mom.

72
00:04:58,809 --> 00:05:01,369
Guys, you got to hear this guy
on the Zander show.

73
00:05:01,609 --> 00:05:02,928
You're on your own.

74
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:04,847
The family's ditched you. What next?

75
00:05:05,049 --> 00:05:07,768
Do you really care? It's actually not
an easy story to tell.

76
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:10,278
I got four hours a day to fill, man.

77
00:05:10,489 --> 00:05:12,923
It's not often I get a freak
plopped into my lap.

78
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:15,085
Go ahead. I'm a roast. Baste me.

79
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:16,604
All right, man.

80
00:05:16,809 --> 00:05:19,881
My parents, my sister and /
all went to the Grand Canyon.

81
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:22,728
While they checked out the sights
and donkeys and whatnot...

82
00:05:22,929 --> 00:05:25,443
-.../ somehow got separated from them.
-Makes his shot.

83
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:29,088
Hey, Dad. Look. It's the good stuff.

84
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:32,440
None of that pussy Skoal. Right, Dad?

85
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:33,758
Dad?

86
00:05:34,049 --> 00:05:35,118
Mom!

87
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:38,004
Dad! Mom!

88
00:05:39,049 --> 00:05:40,118
Where are you?!

89
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:41,684
Dad!

90
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,045
Mom! Where are you?!

91
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:48,559
You can come out now.

92
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:51,884
So there / was.

93
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:55,001
A lot of kids would have been scared
but / was tough about it.

94
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:57,325
/ walked till the cops picked me up...

95
00:05:57,569 --> 00:05:59,719
...and put me into a foster home.

96
00:06:00,049 --> 00:06:02,358
One guy / fostered out to
for about a month.

97
00:06:02,609 --> 00:06:04,600
He'd take me hunting with him
and his dog.

98
00:06:04,809 --> 00:06:08,006
/ thought hunting would be,
you know, more fun than it was.

99
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:12,640
See, boy, he goes off and fetches
the duck. You see how that works?

100
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:13,998
Fun, huh?

101
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:20,727
After that, / spent time
with people who worked on a farm.

102
00:06:21,609 --> 00:06:24,999
/ learned cows don't find
bottle rockets as funny as / do.

103
00:06:39,489 --> 00:06:42,208
Then there was this old lady
who had me for a couple weeks.

104
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:45,003
/ don't want to be unkind,
but she was a little off-balanced.

105
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:46,961
Scrub clean before supper.

106
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:49,922
And that means wash
under your fingernails...

107
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:53,838
...and back of your ears
and dress in your Sunday best.

108
00:06:54,049 --> 00:06:58,565
I expect your schoolwork done every
night, laid out for my inspection.

109
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:00,282
-Is that clear?
-Yes, ma'am.

110
00:07:00,489 --> 00:07:02,480
Can I push him off my leg?

111
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,801
He'll stop humping
as soon as he's done.

112
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:09,325
Well, the year was 1982.

113
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:12,766
/ was 1 1 years old now, and /'d gotten
in a little trouble here and there...

114
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:14,960
...so / was in a juvie home
for boys...

115
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:19,005
...and / was getting ready
to split that scene, and pronto.

116
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:24,525
Bob Seger?

117
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:28,199
Be honest, it was Leif Garrett.
It was probably more like this:

118
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:37,118
No, sir, man. I don't like that crap.
I'm a rocker, through and through.

119
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:41,447
Here's my favorite bands: AC/DC,
Van Halen, not Van Hagar...

120
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:43,401
-...Skynyrd, Def Lepp--
-All right.

121
00:07:43,649 --> 00:07:46,083
Don't make me
call your probey officer.

122
00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:48,362
And riddle me this:

123
00:07:48,609 --> 00:07:52,238
Other than the fact that you dig
looking like Jane Fonda in Klute...

124
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:54,844
...why don't you cut the wig now?

125
00:07:56,369 --> 00:07:59,600
Well, yeah. I guess I could do that.

126
00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:02,767
Zander just asked this Joe Dirt
why he doesn't cut the wig.

127
00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:04,641
You can tell he's never
thought of that.

128
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:07,079
Except for the ratty stache
and the pork chops...

129
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:10,406
...you're pretty clean-shaven for
a kid who lives in a trash can. No?

130
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:14,164
I don't need to shave because it don't
grow in right here and here.

131
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:18,118
You're telling me you were
so ingrained with white-trash DNA...

132
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:22,766
...your facial hair actually grows in
on its own all white-trashy like that?

133
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:26,564
I don't know what you're saying,
but that's what's going on, yeah.

134
00:08:26,929 --> 00:08:31,286
So back to the story here.
You're on your own....

135
00:08:31,489 --> 00:08:33,719
I'm just camping out or whatever...

136
00:08:34,249 --> 00:08:38,083
...and this goes on for years until
one night, something amazing happened.

137
00:08:41,449 --> 00:08:43,405
Man, a shooting star.

138
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:45,646
I got to make a wish.

139
00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:50,879
I wish I knew what happened that
one day at that Grand Canyon place.

140
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:04,718
It's a meteorite!

141
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:08,606
Whoa, check it out. That's cool.
Oh, man, look at you.

142
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:12,006
You're probably made of precious
metal, and everyone'll want you.

143
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:14,439
But you want to be with me! Right on!

144
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:17,402
You're Joe Meteorite,
and I'm Joe Dirt!

145
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:24,285
Here on earth,
we call this place the town.

146
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:28,762
A town is a place where everyone
hates you. Kids try to beat you up.

147
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:30,641
-Oh, yes. It's so flat.
-Awesome.

148
00:09:30,849 --> 00:09:34,922
This is going to be awesome.
Holy crap, ladies.

149
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:38,439
Hey, junior dirt bag.
You talking to your rock?

150
00:09:38,729 --> 00:09:40,959
It ain't no rock.
It's a meteor, dum-dum.

151
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:44,286
Did it land on your barber's head
while he was cutting your hair?

152
00:09:44,489 --> 00:09:46,923
Go practice falling down.
I'll be there in a minute.

153
00:09:47,409 --> 00:09:49,206
You want to fight, you little queer?

154
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:50,484
Queer?

155
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:52,117
Is this queer?

156
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:54,797
These queer? What's up? What's up?

157
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:56,203
He must be retarded.

158
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:58,206
Hey, retard, you aren't worth it.

159
00:09:58,449 --> 00:10:00,724
-Come on, let's go.
-Yeah? You are.

160
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:03,727
I mean, you aren't worth it.

161
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:07,923
I told them, Meteor.
You have my back. You're cool.

162
00:10:08,169 --> 00:10:10,080
What's that?

163
00:10:12,449 --> 00:10:15,327
Five dollars. That's mine now.

164
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:19,881
You're my lucky meteor. Right on.
I'll hold your half for you.

165
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:24,925
Meteor, we call this here being
in burger heaven.

166
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:33,887
We need to find a home.

167
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:37,689
We need some stability
in our life, man.

168
00:10:38,369 --> 00:10:39,961
We need to settle down.

169
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:42,960
Life gets hard, you know.

170
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,967
Come on now.

171
00:11:05,609 --> 00:11:07,122
It's a little bumpy.

172
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:14,241
Look at that town, Meteor.
That's pretty.

173
00:11:14,729 --> 00:11:18,039
I bet people in a town like that'll
be nice to us.

174
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:20,082
Let's go down there.

175
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:22,408
Come on.

176
00:11:24,969 --> 00:11:28,405
No way I'd ever sell you, Meteor.
Not in a million years.

177
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:31,846
But just for laughs,
let's see how much you're worth.

178
00:11:32,849 --> 00:11:34,567
Well, it ain't a meteor.

179
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:36,407
It is. It came out of the sky.

180
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:41,643
I'm sure it did, but it ain't a meteor.
It's a big old frozen chunk of shit.

181
00:11:41,849 --> 00:11:43,077
-What?
-Oh, yeah.

182
00:11:43,289 --> 00:11:47,362
Airplanes dump their toilets 36,000
feet, stuff freezes, falls to earth.

183
00:11:47,569 --> 00:11:49,719
We call them Boeing bombs.

184
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,839
That can't be. That's not what it is.

185
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:54,084
I'm afraid so.

186
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:57,927
You see the peanut? Dead giveaway.

187
00:11:58,169 --> 00:12:00,888
Yeah, that's a space peanut.

188
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:02,204
I'm afraid not.

189
00:12:02,409 --> 00:12:05,048
This is a big old frozen
chunk of poopie.

190
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,361
Dude, you were eating off it.

191
00:12:10,609 --> 00:12:11,678
Oh, God.

192
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:14,687
Okay. That's too much, too much.
Then what happened?

193
00:12:14,969 --> 00:12:16,368
Well, then I got a dog.

194
00:12:16,609 --> 00:12:19,919
You're saying you'd rather have a dog
than a frozen hunk of crap.

195
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:25,927
/t wasn't really my dog.
/t was this girl's dog.

196
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:30,407
/ was living in the woods outside of
that postcard town / said. Silvertown.

197
00:12:30,849 --> 00:12:33,443
/'d come in to steal stuff,
you know, food, whatever.

198
00:12:33,689 --> 00:12:35,407
And then one winter....

199
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:50,958
Are you okay, boy?

200
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:55,849
Oh, no, are your nuts
frozen to the porch?

201
00:12:59,689 --> 00:13:01,008
Oh, that sucks.

202
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:02,881
Don't pull on them.

203
00:13:07,849 --> 00:13:09,248
-Who are you?
-It's okay.

204
00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:11,804
I was just walking by.
Your dog's in a little trouble.

205
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:13,681
-What's wrong?
-I think his....

206
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:17,086
You know how when you get your
tongue frozen in a freezer...

207
00:13:17,289 --> 00:13:20,565
...because it's all wet?
I think he got--

208
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:22,839
-Nuts frozen to the porch?
-Yes, exactly.

209
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:25,005
Oh, baby. Well, what do we do?

210
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:27,848
We got to do something....
Do you have something inside?

211
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:30,158
Don't pull on them.

212
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:33,407
It's okay. Don't move,
it'll stretch them more. That's bad.

213
00:13:34,929 --> 00:13:36,806
No. That's wrong.

214
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:39,967
No, that's way wrong.
Do you got like warm water and....

215
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:42,080
-A fork!
-Yeah. No. What?

216
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:45,803
A spatula thing. The flat one.

217
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:48,603
I'm sorry, buddy.
Just give her a second. Dang.

218
00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:50,481
I got it. Now what?

219
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:54,881
Now here's what we do. I just pour a
little water on here. You hold him.

220
00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:56,044
Easy.

221
00:13:56,249 --> 00:13:59,400
Ain't no flapjack, I'd go easy.
Should loosen it up a little bit....

222
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:01,924
I don't want to look. I'm sorry.

223
00:14:02,969 --> 00:14:04,687
One, two, three, go.

224
00:14:05,689 --> 00:14:08,123
There. Hey, buddy, you're free!

225
00:14:08,969 --> 00:14:10,960
-Good boy!
-Good job.

226
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:14,918
You might want to spray this porch
with Pam, so it don't happen again.

227
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:17,682
What's his name?

228
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:19,604
Charlie.

229
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:21,044
And mine's Brandy.

230
00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:22,477
Hi, Brandy. I'm Joe Dirt.

231
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,924
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

232
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:29,088
Get your ass in the kitchen. Fire up
that stove, you got some cooking to do.

233
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:32,117
Daddy? Can we have my new friend
Joe, over for supper?

234
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,241
Are you nuts, girl? We ain't running
no soup kitchen here, boy.

235
00:14:35,489 --> 00:14:36,558
Scat! Get out of here!

236
00:14:37,609 --> 00:14:38,962
Long-haired hippie freak.

237
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,602
He's mean.

238
00:14:45,729 --> 00:14:47,287
I'll be your friend.

239
00:14:47,689 --> 00:14:49,680
For some reason,
and / have no idea why...

240
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,205
...Brandy always wanted
to hang out with me.

241
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:54,047
/ had Charlie, so that was cool.

242
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:59,958
For the next couple years, the three
of us was hanging out at the farm.

243
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:02,808
That was the closest thing
/ ever had to a home.

244
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:04,482
Till one day....

245
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:15,964
-Oh, Dirt, did I get you?
-No, I'm cool.

246
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:18,603
No, you're not. Where's Brandy?

247
00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:21,164
She's riding her horse.
She'll be back in a minute.

248
00:15:21,369 --> 00:15:22,848
You guys want to play bumper pool?

249
00:15:23,049 --> 00:15:24,004
No.

250
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:26,208
How does she put up with you, Dirt?

251
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:27,683
That's a good question.

252
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:29,242
She's great though, ain't she?

253
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:31,481
You know, sometimes it's like...

254
00:15:31,689 --> 00:15:33,088
...she likes me or something.

255
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:34,927
Dream on, Dirt-boy.

256
00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:37,040
A girl like that's out of your league.

257
00:15:37,249 --> 00:15:38,967
She wants my body.

258
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:43,126
No, I know, man, that's all....
That's for you. I'm not....

259
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:45,047
We're friends.
She's out of my league.

260
00:15:45,249 --> 00:15:47,319
Don't ever forget it, Dirt.

261
00:15:49,969 --> 00:15:51,004
Check this out, Robbie.

262
00:15:51,209 --> 00:15:52,688
This is a good month. Dang.

263
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:56,086
This guy's got a dashmat
for a '69 Nova he wants to sell...

264
00:15:56,289 --> 00:16:00,168
...and a car cover
for any Dodge from '79 to '84.

265
00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:02,128
You don't even have a car.

266
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:06,481
I know, but that's a deal. They're
usually 80 bucks and this guy wants 40.

267
00:16:06,729 --> 00:16:08,447
Look at this. Charlie, see that?

268
00:16:08,689 --> 00:16:11,442
This guy's selling a Hurst
speed shifter with a pool-ball grip.

269
00:16:11,689 --> 00:16:13,281
One day I'll have a car that bad-ass.

270
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:16,003
I'll be chirping gears
and pulling brodies, going....

271
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:20,120
You'll stick your head out the window,
check out chick-dogs, "What's up?"

272
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:22,160
Boy, I swear, I'll slap you silly.

273
00:16:22,369 --> 00:16:26,965
Tell you what: Why don't you practice
spitting out teeth, because I will--

274
00:16:50,849 --> 00:16:51,759
Come here.

275
00:16:54,489 --> 00:16:55,524
What's up, goat-roper?

276
00:16:55,729 --> 00:16:56,684
Not much, pig-licker.

277
00:16:56,889 --> 00:16:59,926
Watch the gun, baby.
That's how I get the gals.

278
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:02,199
Come on.
I'll treat you to a Dairy Queen.

279
00:17:03,049 --> 00:17:04,846
Why are you being all nice?

280
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:07,563
I am always nice to you, Joe Dirt.

281
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:09,564
Can I come too?

282
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:12,762
Robbie, I only have enough money
for me and Joe.

283
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:16,201
Come on, Joe. Let's do it.

284
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:18,684
-Come on, Charlie.
-Come on, boy!

285
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:23,001
Oh, God. She is so fine.

286
00:17:24,889 --> 00:17:27,847
One day, I'm gonna marry that girl.

287
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,207
Oh, there you are.

288
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,684
Give me that mutt.

289
00:17:51,889 --> 00:17:55,484
-Take him hunting with me.
-Daddy. You've been drinking.

290
00:17:55,689 --> 00:17:58,123
Shut the hell up.
Just give me the mutt now.

291
00:17:58,329 --> 00:18:01,958
If you take the dog, I'll go with him
because I've been hunting before.

292
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:05,206
You hunt? I wouldn't even
use you as a retriever.

293
00:18:06,129 --> 00:18:08,404
That's a good one.
Charlie, get in the car.

294
00:18:11,249 --> 00:18:12,682
Charlie, you mangy mutt!

295
00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:15,608
Get in the damn car,
you flea-bitten...

296
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:17,959
...butt-licking...

297
00:18:18,449 --> 00:18:20,007
...son of a bitch.

298
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:27,681
Two.

299
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:29,962
Yeah! What?

300
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:35,800
Hey, my foot's stuck!

301
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:42,968
Charlie, come here.
Come here now. Come here, Charlie.

302
00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:46,204
My foot's stuck. See my foot's stuck?

303
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:49,162
I need your help. I need you
to go find Sheriff Williams.

304
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:51,758
Now go on. Go get him. Go get help.

305
00:18:51,969 --> 00:18:54,767
Go get him. Run, Charlie.
Run like the wind!

306
00:18:56,249 --> 00:18:57,682
Run!

307
00:18:58,409 --> 00:19:00,001
Run, Charlie.

308
00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:11,198
That stupid dog better
be bringing somebody.

309
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:17,040
Your dad always hunt this long?

310
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:18,758
Hey, there's Charlie!

311
00:19:20,689 --> 00:19:23,203
There's my buddy. Where've you been?

312
00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:27,839
There you go, Don.

313
00:19:28,409 --> 00:19:29,728
Take her easy.

314
00:19:32,689 --> 00:19:33,644
Oh, my God!

315
00:19:33,889 --> 00:19:35,163
There's that worthless mutt.

316
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:36,404
What happened?

317
00:19:36,649 --> 00:19:38,082
It's that goddamn dog's fault!

318
00:19:38,369 --> 00:19:39,961
Now I'm putting him down.

319
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:43,008
-No, you can't! Don't!
-Guess who came back, Charlie?!

320
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:52,045
Joe, he's okay now.
He's in dog heaven.

321
00:19:52,249 --> 00:19:54,479
You gave him some great last years.

322
00:19:55,049 --> 00:19:58,837
Sprinkle his ashes.
They'll drift out to sea.

323
00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:00,764
He would have liked that.

324
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:05,203
I can't do it.

325
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:09,277
I'm taking him with me.

326
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:12,488
Taking him with you? But...

327
00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:14,481
...where are you going?

328
00:20:15,209 --> 00:20:16,324
You see that moon?

329
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:21,080
You don't know how many nights
I spend alone staring at that moon...

330
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:25,441
...wondering if at that moment, my mom
or my dad was looking at it too.

331
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:30,241
And for that brief second, we were
together again, kind of. You know?

332
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:35,003
When I was with Charlie,
I didn't miss that moon so much.

333
00:20:36,489 --> 00:20:39,049
Brandy, I got a hole in my heart.
I don't know how to fix it.

334
00:20:39,649 --> 00:20:43,722
I gotta find out what happened
at the Grand Canyon. I gotta do it.

335
00:20:44,649 --> 00:20:48,722
But what if when you're gone,
some guy asks me to marry him...

336
00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:49,964
...and you're not here?

337
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:53,366
What's that got to do with me?
We'll always be buddies.

338
00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:56,482
Well, if I get married...

339
00:20:56,769 --> 00:20:58,725
...we might move and...

340
00:20:58,969 --> 00:21:00,687
...you might not know
where to find me.

341
00:21:00,889 --> 00:21:03,005
You are gonna make some guy so happy.

342
00:21:03,209 --> 00:21:06,326
I just hope whoever he is,
he deserves a girl like you.

343
00:21:08,689 --> 00:21:10,566
God, that Brandy has a nice ass.

344
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:14,518
I got this loser talking about
the moon and walking his dog.

345
00:21:14,729 --> 00:21:17,960
All the time, I'm thinking about
Brandy's well-manicured backyard...

346
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:20,160
...and those cut-off shorts.

347
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:21,688
Yeah, she's cool.

348
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:24,687
So there I was on my own again
looking for my parents.

349
00:21:24,889 --> 00:21:26,800
-But I don't know their last names.
-It's Dirt.

350
00:21:27,009 --> 00:21:29,807
Isn't that the name
on the family crest? Dirt.

351
00:21:30,009 --> 00:21:33,445
No, my last name's Dirt.
My dad made it Dirt, for some reason.

352
00:21:33,689 --> 00:21:36,487
I just put an "e" on it,
pronounce it " Dirté."

353
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:38,924
It's no big deal.
It actually sounds pretty cool.

354
00:21:39,129 --> 00:21:40,562
But I don't know their last name...

355
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:44,125
...and I remember my sister yelling
at my face when I was growing up....

356
00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:47,879
That's why Dad named you Joe Dirt!
That's why Dad named you Joe Dirt!

357
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:50,080
That's why Dad named you
Joe Dirt instead of....

358
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:52,200
I couldn't remember my real last name.

359
00:21:52,409 --> 00:21:54,479
-I knew they'd be hard to find.
-So what'd you do?

360
00:21:54,729 --> 00:21:55,923
I needed some money.

361
00:21:57,209 --> 00:22:00,804
/ hopped a train out of Silvertown
and headed east for the big city.

362
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,848
Then / got lucky.

363
00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:09,847
/ got myself a real important job
in advertising.

364
00:22:10,049 --> 00:22:13,644
Molar World. Walk-ins welcome.
There you go.

365
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:17,285
Molar World. One for the kid? Sure.

366
00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:20,961
What's up?

367
00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:22,568
Oh, my God!

368
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:26,563
Competition, orange '67.
This thing's a Hemi!

369
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:29,760
Ma'am, are you selling this car?

370
00:22:29,969 --> 00:22:31,960
Literally just went onto the market.

371
00:22:32,169 --> 00:22:33,488
Well, how much for it?

372
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:35,798
What do you got?

373
00:22:36,569 --> 00:22:38,958
Practically nothing.
I'm looking for my parents.

374
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:41,729
They lost me at the Grand Canyon
more than ten years ago.

375
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:44,568
All my money goes towards that.
I don't have pictures of them.

376
00:22:44,889 --> 00:22:47,005
You don't even have a picture?

377
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:50,162
Well, you know, my ex-husband,
before he died....

378
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,848
Oh. I'm sorry.

379
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:54,643
No. I killed him.
He used to beat me.

380
00:22:54,849 --> 00:22:57,647
So one night I just pushed him
into the woodchipper.

381
00:22:58,329 --> 00:22:59,648
Told the cops he fell.

382
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:01,638
Good for you.

383
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:06,440
But he used to be a police
sketch artist. He was damn good too.

384
00:23:06,689 --> 00:23:10,841
Victims gave him the worst descriptions
and he'd draw them like photographs.

385
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:15,002
He could do anything.
You know? Like age progression and--

386
00:23:15,209 --> 00:23:17,928
That's what I'll do for my parents.
How much that cost?

387
00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:20,808
About 360 bucks.

388
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:23,798
Then that's what I need to make.
Thank you.

389
00:23:24,009 --> 00:23:26,398
Sorry I can't buy your beautiful Hemi.

390
00:23:26,769 --> 00:23:29,044
Oh, no. You can.

391
00:23:29,249 --> 00:23:31,240
Give me what's in your pocket
and she's yours.

392
00:23:31,449 --> 00:23:32,279
For real?!

393
00:23:34,489 --> 00:23:37,287
You hear that, Charlie?
We got us a Hemi, brother.

394
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:39,367
That lady gave me a great idea.

395
00:23:39,569 --> 00:23:41,287
Dirt! Storm's coming in!

396
00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:44,765
Get up on that roof
and put some bricks in the tooth!

397
00:23:58,449 --> 00:23:59,359
My tooth!

398
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:00,962
My tooth!

399
00:24:02,089 --> 00:24:04,000
Back! Go back!

400
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:08,720
I can see down your shirt!

401
00:24:09,089 --> 00:24:10,044
What an ass!

402
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,804
Hey, boss, I'm going on a break!

403
00:24:23,369 --> 00:24:25,405
Airplane! Help me!

404
00:24:36,489 --> 00:24:38,241
Oh, that's not professional.

405
00:24:55,169 --> 00:24:57,160
/'d floated all the way
to North Dakota.

406
00:24:57,369 --> 00:25:00,964
There / was, scared to death as /
dropped like a stone from the sky.

407
00:25:04,849 --> 00:25:06,248
Go back! Go back!

408
00:25:15,569 --> 00:25:17,446
Then an amazing thing happened.

409
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:20,209
/ landed by an oil rig,
and they was hiring people.

410
00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:24,482
The wage was like a sign from above
that / was meant to find my parents.

411
00:25:27,089 --> 00:25:28,647
Hey, Joe, come on down!

412
00:25:28,849 --> 00:25:30,248
Get the drill!

413
00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:35,845
Yeah, baby. Come on now. Get loose.

414
00:25:37,649 --> 00:25:41,437
Whoops, that's me! I got it!
It's pumping. I'll pay for this!

415
00:25:42,129 --> 00:25:43,357
I'm new!

416
00:25:43,729 --> 00:25:45,959
I'm new! I don't know what to do!

417
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:54,079
You done with that apple core?

418
00:25:55,209 --> 00:25:57,279
I'm done with that fart. Want that?

419
00:25:58,009 --> 00:26:00,921
Maybe if it came out of Charlene
Tilton's ass, I'd take a bite.

420
00:26:01,129 --> 00:26:02,960
You probably like J.R., you queer.

421
00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:07,003
I saw your bumper sticker:
" Cowboys' butts drive me nuts."

422
00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:10,687
Is that right? You think
that's queer? ls this queer?

423
00:26:10,889 --> 00:26:12,959
They're larging and charging,
looking for chickies.

424
00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:14,839
You want to back that up?

425
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:18,325
Want to fight? Why don't you stick
your head up my butt and fight for air?

426
00:26:18,649 --> 00:26:20,799
That's it. You and me. Let's go.

427
00:26:21,689 --> 00:26:24,078
I'd love to beat your ass
up and down this place.

428
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:25,768
I got to go back to work.

429
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:29,684
Joe Dirt. You're fired.
Here's your week's pay.

430
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:33,918
Dang.

431
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:41,646
What's up here? What's down there?

432
00:26:41,929 --> 00:26:44,079
What's going on, man? Here I come.

433
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:51,725
Luckily, my neck broke my fall.

434
00:26:54,129 --> 00:26:56,006
I guess you won the battle.

435
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:58,164
But / won the war.

436
00:26:58,369 --> 00:27:01,679
/f you're covered in oil,
don't stand next to a fire.

437
00:27:03,569 --> 00:27:05,685
Now that's day-one stuff.

438
00:27:10,089 --> 00:27:13,047
Keep that Skoal, baby.
That's what I'm talking about.

439
00:27:16,489 --> 00:27:20,198
So / had my 360 bucks. The next day
/ would try the police sketch thing.

440
00:27:20,409 --> 00:27:21,888
But something happened to my head.

441
00:27:22,089 --> 00:27:25,764
/ spent the night in what / thought
was an abandoned circus tent.

442
00:27:25,969 --> 00:27:27,721
But / guess it was no circus.

443
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:30,238
/ was totally bombed
on insecticide, / think.

444
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:40,607
So needless to say, / was in no shape
to do any good with my recollections.

445
00:27:41,449 --> 00:27:43,838
The police sketcher
thought / was messing with him...

446
00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:46,722
...because my dad came out
looking like Father Time...

447
00:27:46,929 --> 00:27:48,408
...and my mom came out too butch...

448
00:27:48,649 --> 00:27:52,483
... Iooking like Richard Ramirez,
the Night Stalker. Remember him?

449
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:57,798
As my head cleared, / realized
/ needed a different approach.

450
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,967
Then / got a brainstorm.:
Hire an /ndian tracker to help me.

451
00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:03,319
Great idea.
They could find anything.

452
00:28:03,569 --> 00:28:07,039
/t's like in the movies.
So / headed for a reservation.

453
00:28:12,969 --> 00:28:17,121
You want me to put my ear to the
ground, listen for hoof beats...

454
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:18,762
...check for footprints...

455
00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:21,199
...look for broken twigs?

456
00:28:21,489 --> 00:28:25,801
But this is the modern age.
That stuff doesn't work anymore.

457
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:29,445
Which is why I had to open
this fireworks stand.

458
00:28:29,849 --> 00:28:32,409
I wasn't getting by
on my tracking wages.

459
00:28:32,649 --> 00:28:35,800
Come on. You're supposed to be
good at tracking stuff, man.

460
00:28:36,009 --> 00:28:37,601
I gotta find my parents.

461
00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:42,564
I need a way to sell more fireworks.
I'm going broke with this venture also.

462
00:28:42,769 --> 00:28:47,160
I see you got snakes and sparklers,
but where's the good stuff, man?

463
00:28:47,369 --> 00:28:50,998
Good stuff. This is the
good stuff. Snakes and sparklers.

464
00:28:51,209 --> 00:28:54,167
Are you nuts, dude? You need
stuff that explodes, go boom.

465
00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:56,678
-Why is that good?
-Well....

466
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:01,005
Well, you might as well
ask why is the tree good?

467
00:29:01,209 --> 00:29:03,325
Why is the sunset good?
Why are boobs good?

468
00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:08,803
Firecrackers. You stick them
in mailboxes, drop them in toilets...

469
00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:10,727
...shove them up a bullfrog's ass.

470
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:13,841
I'd never do that because
I'm going to be a veterinarian.

471
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:15,277
There you go.

472
00:29:15,489 --> 00:29:19,038
Someone shoves an M-80 up a bullfrog's
butt, blows him to pieces...

473
00:29:19,249 --> 00:29:23,322
...he comes back to you to fix it.
You win twice, brother. It's good biz.

474
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:28,684
You're saying you have no black cats,
Roman candles or screaming meemies?

475
00:29:29,409 --> 00:29:32,719
Come on. You don't got no ladyfingers,
buzz bottles, snicker bombs...

476
00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:36,285
...church burners, finger blasters, gut
busters, zippedy-doodas, crap flappers?

477
00:29:36,489 --> 00:29:37,683
No, I don't.

478
00:29:37,929 --> 00:29:41,365
You're gonna stand there,
owning a fireworks stand...

479
00:29:41,609 --> 00:29:43,839
...and say you have
no whistling bungholes...

480
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:48,486
...spleen splitters, whisker biscuits,
honkey lighters, Hüsker Düs and don'ts.

481
00:29:48,689 --> 00:29:51,681
Cherry bombs, nipsy dazers, with
or without the scooter stick...

482
00:29:51,889 --> 00:29:54,244
...or one single
whistling kitty-chaser?

483
00:29:55,369 --> 00:29:56,324
No.

484
00:29:58,249 --> 00:30:01,127
Because snakes and sparklers
are the only ones I like.

485
00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:03,678
That might be your problem.

486
00:30:03,889 --> 00:30:06,687
It's not what you like.
It's the consumer.

487
00:30:08,489 --> 00:30:12,801
Look there. That's happening.
We should get bleachers over here.

488
00:30:13,009 --> 00:30:15,364
People come from miles around
to see this.

489
00:30:15,569 --> 00:30:19,403
Feast your eyes on a feast of smoke.
Oh, dang. It's out.

490
00:30:19,649 --> 00:30:21,924
CNN will turn around and go home now.

491
00:30:22,129 --> 00:30:24,006
I saw a snail over there. He said:

492
00:30:24,409 --> 00:30:28,288
"That thing's slow, it ain't moving
fast, it's boring, dull, I'm yawning."

493
00:30:28,489 --> 00:30:31,322
-That's a snail watching that.
-There's a snail in the desert?

494
00:30:31,569 --> 00:30:34,879
A spaceship dropped him off. Focus on
the right part of the story, brother.

495
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:37,564
-And the snail can talk?
-Yeah.

496
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:40,602
The aliens gave him powers.
They made a voice spot.

497
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:43,960
Dude, I'm just saying it's dull.
All right? This ain't fun.

498
00:30:44,169 --> 00:30:45,966
Look at that little piece of char.

499
00:30:46,169 --> 00:30:48,603
You need explosions, stuff going on.

500
00:30:48,809 --> 00:30:52,245
No wonder this thing's going under.
You got nothing. It's wussy stuff.

501
00:30:55,929 --> 00:30:57,282
I got these two sticks.

502
00:30:57,489 --> 00:31:01,880
Dang. These are yours? These are
Roman candles! It's good stuff!

503
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:04,638
This thing full of lighter fluid.

504
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:11,566
The Roman candle.
Step back a little bit.

505
00:31:14,409 --> 00:31:16,127
That's what I'm talking about!

506
00:31:16,329 --> 00:31:17,648
It's beautiful.

507
00:31:17,849 --> 00:31:21,888
Beautiful? I'm looking for righteously
kick-ass. You know what we need?

508
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:25,126
Gasoline. Yeah.

509
00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:29,045
Breakfast of champions.

510
00:31:29,369 --> 00:31:33,203
All right, you might want to take
a few extra steps back on this one.

511
00:31:42,249 --> 00:31:45,685
Man. What'd I trip over?

512
00:31:45,889 --> 00:31:48,801
There's something metal
sticking out of the ground.

513
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:51,922
You okay?

514
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:55,399
What is this thing, man?

515
00:31:55,849 --> 00:32:00,604
We should take it over to the lab
over in the next town. Los Alamos.

516
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:02,606
That symbol looks very stern.

517
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:05,926
That's definitely what we should do.
That's the right thing.

518
00:32:06,129 --> 00:32:07,039
But first....

519
00:32:08,729 --> 00:32:10,879
Yeah, jam that in the gas bucket.

520
00:32:12,649 --> 00:32:14,879
We'll shoot fireballs at it.

521
00:32:15,089 --> 00:32:17,478
We got to step way back.
It'll be fun.

522
00:32:26,649 --> 00:32:28,640
Look at that shit!

523
00:32:28,969 --> 00:32:32,803
Oh, man, we're going to get
so busted. Let's get out of here.

524
00:32:45,969 --> 00:32:47,368
What happened, man?

525
00:32:47,569 --> 00:32:50,925
You tripped over that object
in the ground. You're knocked out.

526
00:32:53,289 --> 00:32:55,803
That thing's an atom bomb, man.

527
00:32:57,769 --> 00:32:59,043
I got an idea.

528
00:33:00,009 --> 00:33:02,125
" Rubbernecker's tour bus...

529
00:33:02,329 --> 00:33:05,401
...the Grand Canyon's number one
purveyor of fine bus tours."

530
00:33:06,089 --> 00:33:08,808
I still don't see why we're going
to their tour bus company.

531
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:12,684
Don't you see? All the tourists at the
Canyon that day my parents lost me...

532
00:33:12,889 --> 00:33:14,004
...they had cameras.

533
00:33:14,209 --> 00:33:16,598
You can't tell me in all
those pictures they took...

534
00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:20,802
...there won't be some that
accidentally have me and my parents.

535
00:33:21,009 --> 00:33:23,967
The company will have records
of who used the tour that day.

536
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:26,205
That was more than ten years ago.

537
00:33:26,409 --> 00:33:29,082
Besides, they won't just hand
the records over to us.

538
00:33:29,289 --> 00:33:31,325
We're just an lndian and some guy.

539
00:33:31,569 --> 00:33:35,847
You can't have " no" in your heart.
" No" is not an option, brother.

540
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:38,199
You're not just an lndian,
you're Kicking Wing.

541
00:33:38,569 --> 00:33:41,879
All right? And one day, you'll
be Kicking Wing, Animal Doctor.

542
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:44,319
Then you should change your name
to Kicking Ass.

543
00:33:49,489 --> 00:33:54,279
Oh, man! Swerve them potholes.
You know, because of the atom bomb.

544
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:08,799
One swing and this here ball-peen
hammer will trigger this A-bomb...

545
00:34:09,009 --> 00:34:12,285
...and it'll blow up the whole city,
maybe even half the country.

546
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:13,683
Now here's what I need.

547
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:15,720
I need you to give me the records...

548
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:19,160
...of everybody who toured
the Grand Canyon on them buses...

549
00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:21,246
...June 1 3, 1 979.

550
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:26,757
I'm not messing around.
I hit it and it goes bang. All right?

551
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:29,565
Now while I'm up here waiting....

552
00:34:31,209 --> 00:34:32,483
-You.
-Me?

553
00:34:32,729 --> 00:34:34,242
Show me them boobies.

554
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:47,447
Now even you liked the way
that chick looked. Didn't you?

555
00:34:47,689 --> 00:34:49,247
" Even me?" What's that mean?

556
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:53,044
Just saying, I'm beginning to doubt
your hetero street credentials.

557
00:34:53,249 --> 00:34:54,887
You never put the moves on Brandy.

558
00:34:55,089 --> 00:34:57,080
Well, she's too beautiful.

559
00:34:57,289 --> 00:34:58,324
She's way too hot for me.

560
00:34:58,569 --> 00:35:00,924
He has no idea that Brandy
even likes him.

561
00:35:01,129 --> 00:35:03,882
-His voice is so sexy.
-I wonder what he looks like.

562
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:05,887
You're there with an atom bomb.

563
00:35:06,249 --> 00:35:09,082
Could be Fat Man or Little Boy.
We'll nail that down later.

564
00:35:09,289 --> 00:35:11,086
Did you get the names you wanted?

565
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:13,849
Yeah, I did, but by the way,
it was no atom bomb.

566
00:35:14,049 --> 00:35:17,837
Turns out some skateboarder slapped
a Biohazard band sticker...

567
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:21,041
...on the side of this septic tank
for an RV.

568
00:35:21,249 --> 00:35:23,365
Cops knew it wasn't a bomb right away.

569
00:35:23,569 --> 00:35:25,799
Yeah. Who hasn't seen
that scenario played out?

570
00:35:26,089 --> 00:35:28,444
It's just an old crapper tank, people.

571
00:35:32,689 --> 00:35:34,839
-It's poo!
-Take it away!

572
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,118
Stop it!

573
00:35:36,329 --> 00:35:39,924
-It stinks! Get it out of here!
-Somebody help me! Help me!

574
00:35:41,289 --> 00:35:44,486
Is it done? How much is in there?

575
00:35:44,729 --> 00:35:46,720
I got the poo on me.

576
00:35:46,929 --> 00:35:48,806
You are so pathetic.

577
00:35:49,009 --> 00:35:50,488
They decided not to arrest me.

578
00:35:50,729 --> 00:35:53,368
They said being covered in that
stinky stuff was punishment enough.

579
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:54,485
Don't you get it?

580
00:35:54,689 --> 00:35:58,398
Stinky stuff is your milieu.
Okay? This is your deal:

581
00:35:58,609 --> 00:36:01,646
You are an underachievement
nexus in the universe.

582
00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:03,680
It'll always be like this, Joey.

583
00:36:03,889 --> 00:36:07,040
But you got to keep going.
I won't quit. That's not an option.

584
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:10,878
You gotta keep on keeping on. Life's
a garden, dig it, make it work for you.

585
00:36:11,089 --> 00:36:14,365
You never give up, man.
That's my philosophy. You hear that?

586
00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:17,521
What drives me crazy and fascinates me
at the same time...

587
00:36:17,729 --> 00:36:21,722
..is you are so unrelentingly
upbeat about your plight.

588
00:36:23,129 --> 00:36:26,565
I need more. I'll be honest,
I want to see you in here tomorrow.

589
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:29,237
I want to hear more
of the saga of Joe Dirt.

590
00:36:29,809 --> 00:36:31,003
All right. Thanks, guys.

591
00:36:32,809 --> 00:36:33,764
All right, Joe.

592
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:35,598
Yeah, baby.

593
00:37:35,649 --> 00:37:38,561
You're listening
to the Zander Kelly show on KXLA.

594
00:37:38,769 --> 00:37:43,126
All right. Good morning, troops. This
is Zander Kelly, and you, of course...

595
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:47,288
...are careening headlong into another
hellish day in that tiny existence...

596
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:49,606
...you laughingly refer to...

597
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,323
...as your life.
I'm here with Joe Dirt.

598
00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:56,279
The tale couldn't be told in one day.
We asked you back today.

599
00:37:56,489 --> 00:38:00,448
The joint looks great, the toilets
are freshly scrubbed...

600
00:38:00,689 --> 00:38:02,680
...the floor is spic-and-span.

601
00:38:02,889 --> 00:38:05,244
Did you use the stuff
with the tiny scrubbing bubbles?

602
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:08,805
They clean the bowl
so you don't have to!

603
00:38:09,569 --> 00:38:10,843
-No, I didn't.
-Yesterday--

604
00:38:11,169 --> 00:38:15,526
Provide a back-story for the listeners.
You were covered in crap...

605
00:38:15,729 --> 00:38:19,438
...and you're a complete loser.
Have I nailed the pertinent facts?

606
00:38:19,689 --> 00:38:23,728
Let me emphasize to the listeners
those are your words, not mine.

607
00:38:24,409 --> 00:38:25,478
Sorry, Billy Jack.

608
00:38:25,689 --> 00:38:28,283
So now you have a bunch of names...

609
00:38:28,489 --> 00:38:32,164
...of people who might have
a photograph of you and your parents.

610
00:38:32,409 --> 00:38:35,719
Right, a big bunch of names.
So now I got to span the country...

611
00:38:35,929 --> 00:38:39,638
...to find these people to see if
anybody's got a photo from that day.

612
00:38:40,409 --> 00:38:43,924
"Anderson, Anders, Aznoff...."

613
00:38:44,129 --> 00:38:48,919
You mean, all these people were
on them tour buses that day?

614
00:38:49,129 --> 00:38:51,882
It will take forever, man.
But I got to do it.

615
00:38:52,569 --> 00:38:53,888
I wish you luck.

616
00:38:54,169 --> 00:38:56,205
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

617
00:38:56,409 --> 00:38:58,559
Remember that town
you're always talking about.

618
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:01,567
-Yeah, Silvertown, man.
-Yes, Silvertown.

619
00:39:01,769 --> 00:39:03,839
You make it sound wonderful.

620
00:39:04,049 --> 00:39:06,199
So you've always got Silvertown.

621
00:39:06,409 --> 00:39:07,967
Remember that, Joe Dirt.

622
00:39:08,169 --> 00:39:11,684
You remember to keep on keeping on,
and you'll be a veterinarian.

623
00:39:11,889 --> 00:39:14,084
I believe people get
what they really want.

624
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:17,321
Especially a cool guy like you,
Kicking Wing. You know what?

625
00:39:17,569 --> 00:39:20,242
You're my first real friend,
outside of Charlie and Brandy.

626
00:39:29,009 --> 00:39:30,965
That's good. Good stuff.

627
00:39:31,449 --> 00:39:33,440
That hug was completely asexual.

628
00:39:33,649 --> 00:39:35,002
He kind of snuck it up on me.

629
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:37,439
Whatever you gotta tell yourself.

630
00:39:39,209 --> 00:39:41,040
I love you, Joe Dirt!

631
00:39:46,849 --> 00:39:48,282
/ hit the road with my names list...

632
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:51,720
... Iooking for tourists who might
have photos of my folks.

633
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:55,480
/ hit pay dirt when / got a job
with a traveling carnival.

634
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:57,845
That's when things
got a little weird.

635
00:40:51,929 --> 00:40:52,918
Dang.

636
00:41:02,049 --> 00:41:03,641
Can I go again? Please?

637
00:41:03,849 --> 00:41:05,680
No. It's time to go home.

638
00:41:05,889 --> 00:41:09,245
I got you. Who's this chick
over here? ls that your girlfriend?

639
00:41:09,449 --> 00:41:11,883
You should see my girlfriend.
You'd shit yourself.

640
00:41:12,409 --> 00:41:15,401
Really? I tell you what:
I'll give you a free spin.

641
00:41:15,649 --> 00:41:17,446
I'll talk to your lady friend.

642
00:41:21,569 --> 00:41:23,560
Good job, sir. Keep them straight.

643
00:41:23,769 --> 00:41:24,679
Good strategy.

644
00:41:24,889 --> 00:41:27,847
The carnival worker life
keeps me free and untethered.

645
00:41:28,329 --> 00:41:33,198
That's why I was attracted to you.
I could tell you were an outlaw.

646
00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:36,162
Is that right? I'm kind of
an outlaw through and through, baby.

647
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:39,758
-Damn!
-Good toss there, sir. Good one.

648
00:41:39,969 --> 00:41:42,722
You know, society's got
no hold on this outlaw.

649
00:41:43,649 --> 00:41:45,879
-Damn it!
-All right. Real close.

650
00:41:46,249 --> 00:41:50,083
I'm like a bird. Actually more
like a hard-ass pterodactyl.

651
00:41:51,129 --> 00:41:52,164
This is bullshit!

652
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:55,640
God forbid you don't win after
throwing only two quarters, man.

653
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:58,124
It's a business. It ain't UNICEF.

654
00:41:58,329 --> 00:42:00,126
I got a good mind to take my outlaw....

655
00:42:00,329 --> 00:42:03,048
Yeah, you better walk away, hard-ass.

656
00:42:04,449 --> 00:42:05,848
-Some people. Right?
-I know.

657
00:42:08,689 --> 00:42:11,123
So later on today I'll pick up
my Hemi Roadrunner.

658
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:13,081
That's right. I said Hemi.

659
00:42:13,729 --> 00:42:14,878
A Hemi.

660
00:42:15,329 --> 00:42:16,887
Balls to the wall.

661
00:42:17,249 --> 00:42:20,480
I left it here. Friend's house.
Got towed two years ago.

662
00:42:20,729 --> 00:42:23,004
But I'll pick it up this afternoon.

663
00:42:23,209 --> 00:42:26,121
I might need a pretty little lady
to sit on the front seat with me...

664
00:42:26,329 --> 00:42:29,048
...while I break her in.
The car, I mean.

665
00:42:29,649 --> 00:42:30,843
What do you say?

666
00:42:32,009 --> 00:42:33,442
That's a big ten-four.

667
00:42:36,969 --> 00:42:39,767
I got a big date tonight.
I'm here to pick up my ride.

668
00:42:40,129 --> 00:42:41,084
License and registration.

669
00:42:41,289 --> 00:42:42,563
Yes, sir.

670
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:44,885
She'll freak out
when she sees my wheels.

671
00:42:46,889 --> 00:42:49,767
Total impound fees come to $3496.

672
00:42:49,969 --> 00:42:51,766
Plus 35 bucks for the tow.

673
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:54,358
3000! That's more I paid
for the whole car!

674
00:42:55,769 --> 00:42:58,761
-Interesting. Want it or not?
-Well, yeah, but...

675
00:42:58,969 --> 00:43:01,085
...l think all I got's like 450 bucks.

676
00:43:01,289 --> 00:43:03,166
This is a business, not a charity.

677
00:43:03,369 --> 00:43:05,837
Maybe one day UNICEF will get
into the impound business...

678
00:43:06,049 --> 00:43:08,643
...but until then,
we're the people to see.

679
00:43:10,689 --> 00:43:14,568
I tell you what I could do. I could
sell you a car for 450 bucks, but...

680
00:43:15,449 --> 00:43:16,598
...it won't be no Hemi.

681
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:31,962
I thought you had a Hemi.

682
00:43:32,449 --> 00:43:35,839
Yeah, I had to have
a footprint gas pedal installed.

683
00:43:36,049 --> 00:43:37,368
So I stole this pile.

684
00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:41,441
My outlaw.

685
00:43:42,849 --> 00:43:44,407
That's right. Let's go.

686
00:43:50,609 --> 00:43:52,759
So I had fun tonight.

687
00:43:52,969 --> 00:43:56,200
Even though you took me to
the carnival that I was already at.

688
00:43:56,409 --> 00:44:00,163
I had fun too. Hey, listen.
Can I ask you a question?

689
00:44:00,489 --> 00:44:03,606
If I told you you had a beautiful body,
would you hold it against me?

690
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:06,118
Sure would. Want to go to my place?

691
00:44:06,329 --> 00:44:07,728
Sure do.

692
00:44:11,489 --> 00:44:15,004
All right, so finish your story.
Why do you live with foster parents?

693
00:44:15,209 --> 00:44:17,439
Because when I was nine
or ten years old...

694
00:44:17,689 --> 00:44:21,443
...my parents pulled over to look
at the big dinosaur in California.

695
00:44:21,649 --> 00:44:23,640
The next thing I knew, they're gone.

696
00:44:24,889 --> 00:44:26,447
Wait a minute.
Did you have a brother?

697
00:44:26,649 --> 00:44:30,324
I did. So, you want
to go back in the house?

698
00:44:30,569 --> 00:44:32,241
We can have sex.

699
00:44:34,849 --> 00:44:38,683
She's your sister, dude! She's
gotta be! You made out with her!

700
00:44:38,889 --> 00:44:41,449
What's wrong with you, you pervert?!

701
00:44:41,729 --> 00:44:45,563
I didn't know she was my sister when
I kissed her, so it's not my fault.

702
00:44:45,769 --> 00:44:48,488
And she's one of the hottest girls
on the planet.

703
00:44:49,249 --> 00:44:54,198
You just said your sister's hot! What
a freak! You're going to hell, man!

704
00:44:54,969 --> 00:44:57,722
I gotta tell her what happened,
why I got weird.

705
00:44:57,929 --> 00:45:01,365
And for God's sakes,
I gotta treat her like a sister.

706
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:10,200
We've got questions coming in from....

707
00:45:10,409 --> 00:45:12,684
The phones are going nuts.
That was a bombshell.

708
00:45:12,889 --> 00:45:14,959
Wait, man. I found out later...

709
00:45:15,249 --> 00:45:16,887
...she wasn't my sister.

710
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:17,885
Thank God!

711
00:45:18,129 --> 00:45:21,280
Thank God, dude.
That was gonna be a little much.

712
00:45:21,729 --> 00:45:25,165
So I did a real bad thing there
because...

713
00:45:25,449 --> 00:45:27,565
...l think you're my sister.

714
00:45:28,569 --> 00:45:30,924
Is that all? No.

715
00:45:31,129 --> 00:45:34,246
My family's last name is Buckwalter.
My brother's name is Cletus.

716
00:45:34,449 --> 00:45:38,442
So you see, we're not related.
We can have sex again.

717
00:45:44,889 --> 00:45:47,961
Joe, what's the matter?
Don't I turn you on?

718
00:45:48,169 --> 00:45:50,478
I don't know what the problem is.

719
00:45:50,769 --> 00:45:54,000
Would it help if you went back
to thinking I'm your sister?

720
00:45:54,249 --> 00:45:56,968
Like I'm some
sort of white-trash perv?!

721
00:45:57,169 --> 00:45:59,319
I'm your sister. I'm your sister.

722
00:45:59,529 --> 00:46:01,326
Oh, you're my sister!

723
00:46:02,409 --> 00:46:03,842
/'m kidding.

724
00:46:04,049 --> 00:46:06,847
/ just made that last part up
for laughs, you guys.

725
00:46:07,409 --> 00:46:11,561
Let's break it off for today. Haul
your mangy ass in here tomorrow...

726
00:46:12,009 --> 00:46:17,037
...and we will continue the fascinating
saga that I'm now referring to as...

727
00:46:17,289 --> 00:46:19,405
...the legend of Dirty Joe.

728
00:46:43,929 --> 00:46:47,444
Hi, this is Brandy. /'m not here
right now. Please leave a message.

729
00:46:48,129 --> 00:46:51,644
Hey, Brandy, it's Joe.
I'm out in L.A.

730
00:46:51,889 --> 00:46:55,279
They got me on the radio station
telling my story to everybody.

731
00:46:55,809 --> 00:46:58,243
I didn't get to the sad part yet.

732
00:46:58,449 --> 00:47:01,805
I'm guessing you had reasons
for doing what you did.

733
00:47:02,849 --> 00:47:06,159
And I guess I'm just calling
to say goodbye.

734
00:47:07,049 --> 00:47:08,801
I miss you, Brandy.

735
00:47:22,329 --> 00:47:25,366
You're listening to the
Zander Kelly show on KXLA.

736
00:47:25,649 --> 00:47:29,961
Good morning, L.A. Zander here. We're
sitting with the king of dirt-balls...

737
00:47:30,169 --> 00:47:32,842
...Mr. Joe Dirt. You know,
last night I went home...

738
00:47:33,049 --> 00:47:36,598
...rented Andromeda Strain just so
I could simulate immersion...

739
00:47:36,809 --> 00:47:40,119
...into that bacteriologically unsound
world you call your day-to-day life.

740
00:47:40,329 --> 00:47:43,241
I know where you live.
I've got you in my crosshairs now.

741
00:47:43,449 --> 00:47:46,009
We're gonna go back to your story.
Pick it up.

742
00:47:46,249 --> 00:47:47,477
Now what really happened was...

743
00:47:47,849 --> 00:47:51,205
.../ had a car now, so / left to go
running down the names on my list...

744
00:47:51,409 --> 00:47:54,003
... Iooking for people who took
those photos at the Grand Canyon.

745
00:47:54,209 --> 00:47:56,359
Somewhere in /ndiana, / hit a snag.

746
00:47:56,569 --> 00:47:59,800
/ found a guy who had pictures,
but he turned out to be a freak.

747
00:48:01,089 --> 00:48:02,727
I guess this is the place.

748
00:48:02,929 --> 00:48:04,999
Buffalo Bob's kind of a weird name.

749
00:48:05,209 --> 00:48:08,121
But people say Joe Dirt's
a weird name. And how cool am l?

750
00:48:09,009 --> 00:48:09,998
Excuse me, sir?

751
00:48:10,809 --> 00:48:12,003
Hey, there, young fella.

752
00:48:12,209 --> 00:48:14,404
I'm looking for Buffalo Bob.

753
00:48:14,649 --> 00:48:16,879
Real name's Tim. How can I help you?

754
00:48:17,089 --> 00:48:20,320
I want to talk to you about the time
you went to the Grand Canyon.

755
00:48:20,769 --> 00:48:21,838
Why don't you come inside?

756
00:48:22,089 --> 00:48:24,284
-What did you say your name was?
-Joe Dirt.

757
00:48:26,129 --> 00:48:27,528
Joe Dirt.

758
00:48:27,769 --> 00:48:32,843
It puts the lotion on. You have no
idea what kind of hell I can bring you!

759
00:48:33,049 --> 00:48:37,042
Oh, all right! Enough,
you broken record! Okay!

760
00:48:37,249 --> 00:48:39,479
I've been here two weeks.
What do you want?

761
00:48:39,729 --> 00:48:42,368
It put the lotion on its skin. Now!

762
00:48:42,609 --> 00:48:46,397
Well, say it, don't spray it,
brother. Dang.

763
00:48:46,649 --> 00:48:49,163
-I need a towel now.
-It does what it's told!

764
00:48:51,089 --> 00:48:55,526
There, look, I'm putting the lotion
on the skin. I'm rubbing it in.

765
00:48:59,329 --> 00:49:02,480
To tell you the truth, brother,
between you and me...

766
00:49:02,729 --> 00:49:05,960
...that thing with the dog
is coming off a little fruity.

767
00:49:06,369 --> 00:49:07,484
That's just me talking.

768
00:49:09,129 --> 00:49:12,758
Where's my supplies? Come on.
I thought we had a deal.

769
00:49:13,009 --> 00:49:15,842
Oh, for Christ's sake! Here!

770
00:49:17,849 --> 00:49:21,239
Yee! Auto Trader Ooh, August.
I don't got this one.

771
00:49:21,449 --> 00:49:22,848
There are some deals in here.

772
00:49:23,049 --> 00:49:26,325
Oh, check this out.
"'71 'Cuda, plum crazy purple."

773
00:49:26,529 --> 00:49:28,406
This guy wants fourteen grand.

774
00:49:28,649 --> 00:49:33,086
What?! I give him $7500. I used to
have one of these. This guy's crazy.

775
00:49:33,289 --> 00:49:36,281
We have the place surrounded.
Come out with your hands in the air.

776
00:49:39,809 --> 00:49:41,606
Hey, a little help?

777
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:44,640
-Get him!
-Man in a hole.

778
00:49:45,089 --> 00:49:47,762
-Down here.
-Stay on your back.

779
00:49:47,969 --> 00:49:49,766
I hear people.

780
00:49:52,289 --> 00:49:54,644
It puts the Joe Dirt in the hole.

781
00:49:55,849 --> 00:49:57,362
He was gonna flay you alive...

782
00:49:57,609 --> 00:50:00,567
...and use your skin to cover himself
like a Joe Dirt trench coat.

783
00:50:00,769 --> 00:50:04,478
That's gross, man. I think these
are pictures from the Grand Canyon.

784
00:50:04,689 --> 00:50:08,318
He's taken hundreds of photos over
the years, looking for skin he liked.

785
00:50:08,529 --> 00:50:12,158
He wanted to wear skin with the wiener
tucked under, kind of like a woman.

786
00:50:12,449 --> 00:50:13,928
That's sick, man.

787
00:50:14,169 --> 00:50:16,046
I think that's little me
in a garbage can.

788
00:50:17,649 --> 00:50:20,482
No way! And that's my dad and my mom.

789
00:50:20,849 --> 00:50:23,488
And this is our car. And it's got...

790
00:50:24,049 --> 00:50:25,402
...Louisiana plates.

791
00:50:25,649 --> 00:50:27,640
Hell, yeah! I'm going to Louisiana!

792
00:50:32,849 --> 00:50:34,521
So / cruised down to New Orleans...

793
00:50:34,729 --> 00:50:38,324
...and found a base of operations
for my search at a local grade school.

794
00:50:38,529 --> 00:50:40,724
/ was going to be a janitor.

795
00:50:41,049 --> 00:50:44,644
Mostly mopping. Once in a while,
you got a problem with the boiler.

796
00:50:44,849 --> 00:50:47,044
You have to hit it with a hammer.
But it's a good job.

797
00:50:47,249 --> 00:50:49,479
Yeah, it's all right.
I appreciate this job, man.

798
00:50:49,769 --> 00:50:52,727
This'll be a good base for me
while I look for my parents.

799
00:50:52,929 --> 00:50:54,521
I got a picture of them.

800
00:51:00,729 --> 00:51:01,923
I don't recognize them.

801
00:51:03,169 --> 00:51:05,922
If you find them, you'll tell them
what happened to you?

802
00:51:07,769 --> 00:51:11,205
That Buffalo Bob thing?
There's not much to tell.

803
00:51:11,409 --> 00:51:12,762
I heard some things.

804
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:14,880
It's not good. He's a bad guy.

805
00:51:15,089 --> 00:51:17,125
What exactly did you hear?

806
00:51:17,329 --> 00:51:19,399
The past is past. The future's now.

807
00:51:20,969 --> 00:51:23,403
That's true. Amen to that.

808
00:51:24,049 --> 00:51:27,564
Are you from around here?
Your accent sounds like New York.

809
00:51:27,769 --> 00:51:29,282
No. From here.

810
00:51:29,489 --> 00:51:32,799
Born and raised, though not here.

811
00:51:33,009 --> 00:51:34,647
Over in Kansas.

812
00:51:36,769 --> 00:51:37,804
Is this your wife?

813
00:51:38,449 --> 00:51:39,723
Ex-wife.

814
00:51:39,929 --> 00:51:43,683
She was shot six times.
New York City. I mean Kansas.

815
00:51:45,489 --> 00:51:49,721
She was something. Her eyes
were something azure, you know?

816
00:51:49,929 --> 00:51:52,841
Honey-blonde hair. Her body.

817
00:51:53,689 --> 00:51:55,964
Her legs went on for days.

818
00:51:56,289 --> 00:52:00,805
If she was here right now, maybe we'd
have a house with a little fence...

819
00:52:01,009 --> 00:52:03,159
...up in Silvertown,
that place you talk about.

820
00:52:03,729 --> 00:52:05,685
That's a nice place.

821
00:52:07,729 --> 00:52:08,957
You really loved her.

822
00:52:09,289 --> 00:52:10,244
I miss her.

823
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:16,805
Clem, a kid puked in the cafeteria
again. We need a cleanup right away.

824
00:52:17,409 --> 00:52:18,364
I'm on it.

825
00:52:21,289 --> 00:52:22,358
That's you.

826
00:52:27,969 --> 00:52:30,927
-I'm Joe. Where's the throw up?
-Over there.

827
00:52:31,129 --> 00:52:32,960
I'll clean it up lickety-split.

828
00:52:33,249 --> 00:52:35,968
Speaking of lickety-split, let's
meet up later, see what's going on.

829
00:52:36,169 --> 00:52:38,478
I'm kidding.
But seriously, let's hook up.

830
00:52:38,729 --> 00:52:41,607
I'm new in town, kind of lonely,
looking for my parents.

831
00:52:43,089 --> 00:52:46,718
The puke pile's right over there.
It's a pretty big pile of puke.

832
00:52:47,689 --> 00:52:49,645
So clean the puke. Okay.

833
00:52:51,329 --> 00:52:53,240
Well, well. Lookie here.

834
00:52:55,049 --> 00:52:56,448
Corn off the cob.

835
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:01,165
This kid should get his money back.

836
00:53:01,809 --> 00:53:04,164
-The janitor's going to eat the puke.
-They're hilarious, huh?

837
00:53:05,009 --> 00:53:08,797
I won't. I'm a vegetarian
and looks like there's some meat.

838
00:53:10,209 --> 00:53:11,847
I like kids. They seem to like--

839
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:13,644
They seem to like me.

840
00:53:18,889 --> 00:53:21,767
I'll try the old reverse psychology.

841
00:53:22,969 --> 00:53:25,802
I like getting hit with hot dogs.
It don't bother me.

842
00:53:28,969 --> 00:53:31,483
Guess I'm lucky it wasn't
hot chili day today.

843
00:53:33,769 --> 00:53:35,760
Okay, class.
Let's hear these results.

844
00:53:35,969 --> 00:53:39,359
If my calculations are correct,
this will create ice.

845
00:53:41,769 --> 00:53:44,078
Killer mustard gas!

846
00:53:52,289 --> 00:53:53,642
What'd you say?

847
00:53:56,329 --> 00:54:00,322
You're talking to me all wrong.
It's the wrong tone.

848
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:03,601
Do it again, I'll stab you in the face
with a soldering iron.

849
00:54:03,849 --> 00:54:06,761
Is that right?
Let me ask you something.

850
00:54:08,809 --> 00:54:10,640
Does your mother sew?

851
00:54:13,409 --> 00:54:15,081
Get her to sew that!

852
00:54:21,849 --> 00:54:25,000
You'd think the stupid punks
could think of something funnier than:

853
00:54:25,209 --> 00:54:27,404
" Don't eat it! Here's a hot dog."

854
00:54:35,929 --> 00:54:38,443
What's going on, man?
Did you kick their asses?

855
00:54:38,889 --> 00:54:42,438
-He saved us from the mustard gas.
-You saved our lives, Clem.

856
00:54:42,729 --> 00:54:43,764
Not me.

857
00:54:43,969 --> 00:54:45,243
That's the guy!

858
00:54:45,489 --> 00:54:47,286
You're the one that carried us out.

859
00:54:47,489 --> 00:54:51,402
Shut up, you hard-on.
That's the guy! That's the hero.

860
00:54:51,769 --> 00:54:54,522
All right. Well, then,
thank God for Joe Dirt.

861
00:54:54,769 --> 00:54:56,805
-Oh, no, man. It wasn't me.
-That's Joe Dirt!

862
00:54:57,009 --> 00:54:58,567
Joe Dirt! Joe Dirt!

863
00:55:04,209 --> 00:55:05,642
Come on, Joe Dirt!

864
00:55:06,449 --> 00:55:08,405
How does it feel to be a hero, Joe?

865
00:55:08,609 --> 00:55:10,600
Well, it's like this....

866
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:12,447
Probably feels pretty good.

867
00:55:12,649 --> 00:55:15,083
Especially after that brutal
run-in with Buffalo Bob.

868
00:55:15,329 --> 00:55:17,763
I don't know why you ask me.
Nothing happened.

869
00:55:17,969 --> 00:55:19,687
That's not what I heard.

870
00:55:19,889 --> 00:55:21,242
What's the deal with your haircut?

871
00:55:21,449 --> 00:55:23,804
It's a wig. I was born
without the top of my skull.

872
00:55:24,009 --> 00:55:26,125
Everybody, I'm looking for my parents.

873
00:55:26,369 --> 00:55:29,884
Here's a picture of them. It's taken
1 5 years ago at the Grand Canyon.

874
00:55:30,089 --> 00:55:33,559
If anybody has any information
on their whereabouts...

875
00:55:33,769 --> 00:55:35,122
...please call this number.

876
00:55:35,329 --> 00:55:38,560
You might get a machine, but if
a girl answers, her name is Brandy.

877
00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:42,284
Give her your info.
I appreciate any help I can get.

878
00:55:42,569 --> 00:55:45,402
That being said,
here's the real scoop.

879
00:55:45,649 --> 00:55:48,004
I ain't the guy that saved them kids.

880
00:55:49,249 --> 00:55:50,204
I'm sorry, man.

881
00:55:50,729 --> 00:55:52,640
Here's the real hero.

882
00:55:52,929 --> 00:55:57,047
His name is Clem Doore, from Josette,
Louisiana. He's a friend of mine.

883
00:55:57,249 --> 00:55:58,238
Oh, no.

884
00:55:58,449 --> 00:56:00,644
He's your real hero, people, not me.

885
00:56:05,609 --> 00:56:08,077
Let's go. Come on, come on.
Move it, move it.

886
00:56:08,289 --> 00:56:11,804
Move your asses. Okay, this is
where that rat-bastard lives.

887
00:56:12,009 --> 00:56:13,806
You two shoot him low, you high.

888
00:56:14,049 --> 00:56:16,040
I'll shoot him
right through his heart.

889
00:56:17,089 --> 00:56:20,365
That's it. Come on, let's move it.
Kick it in! Kick it in!

890
00:56:39,689 --> 00:56:40,758
What happened here?

891
00:56:41,089 --> 00:56:43,444
-Don't I know you?
-What's going on?

892
00:56:43,689 --> 00:56:44,565
Wait a minute.

893
00:56:44,769 --> 00:56:47,966
You're that guy that had that
run-in with that psycho. Buffalo Bob.

894
00:56:48,529 --> 00:56:49,928
Yeah. It was really no big deal.

895
00:56:50,129 --> 00:56:52,768
No big deal! That's not what I heard.

896
00:56:52,969 --> 00:56:54,084
Is Clem all right?

897
00:56:54,409 --> 00:56:55,364
No, he's dead.

898
00:56:55,769 --> 00:56:57,088
He's dead? What happened?

899
00:56:57,289 --> 00:57:00,247
Your buddy Clem's real name
was Anthony Benedetti.

900
00:57:00,449 --> 00:57:03,327
He was a former boss
of the Cameleri crime family.

901
00:57:03,529 --> 00:57:06,407
He was in town here on the
Federal Witness Relocation program.

902
00:57:07,009 --> 00:57:09,398
He turned informer when
the syndicate executed his wife.

903
00:57:09,609 --> 00:57:11,998
His old cronies must have
somehow found he was here...

904
00:57:12,209 --> 00:57:13,608
...and they came and killed him.

905
00:57:14,049 --> 00:57:17,439
He killed all of them too.
It's a big mess.

906
00:57:20,289 --> 00:57:22,359
Oh, my God, man. This is my fault.

907
00:57:26,569 --> 00:57:30,164
Be cool, let me talk to him
for a second? He's a friend of mine.

908
00:57:30,369 --> 00:57:32,599
-This is my fault.
-Go ahead.

909
00:57:33,129 --> 00:57:35,085
I didn't know you didn't
want to be on TV.

910
00:57:35,329 --> 00:57:38,321
I just tried to get the word out
about my parents. I'm so sorry.

911
00:57:38,569 --> 00:57:40,446
Maybe you'll find your wife in heaven.

912
00:57:40,689 --> 00:57:43,044
She'll be just how you remembered her.

913
00:57:43,329 --> 00:57:45,843
Them big doe eyes.

914
00:57:46,369 --> 00:57:49,406
That soft honey-blonde hair.

915
00:57:49,889 --> 00:57:52,687
Smooth tan skin.

916
00:57:53,129 --> 00:57:55,438
Huge, pert rack.

917
00:57:55,649 --> 00:57:59,688
Long legs going up that tight butt.

918
00:58:03,969 --> 00:58:06,403
Clem, you asshole, are you alive?

919
00:58:08,369 --> 00:58:11,361
They're pretending I'm dead,
so's they can move me.

920
00:58:11,569 --> 00:58:14,402
I just didn't know you were in
this Witness Protection thing.

921
00:58:14,649 --> 00:58:17,368
I never would have said
your name on TV, man.

922
00:58:17,609 --> 00:58:20,681
I found it was time to move on anyway.
You know, maybe...

923
00:58:20,929 --> 00:58:23,318
...find a better town.

924
00:58:24,289 --> 00:58:26,245
There's something you
should think about.

925
00:58:26,449 --> 00:58:31,079
I was thinking about that car.
The Rambler Wagon. That's a rare car.

926
00:58:31,329 --> 00:58:34,958
People would remember
selling a car like that.

927
00:58:35,169 --> 00:58:36,079
Where's that dead guy?

928
00:58:36,289 --> 00:58:37,768
Wait. Joe, wait.

929
00:58:38,729 --> 00:58:41,402
Take care, Joe Dirt.

930
00:58:42,569 --> 00:58:44,127
Watch my hair.

931
00:58:45,089 --> 00:58:49,560
Yep, those came with a 6-cylinder
258 automatic. The three on the tree.

932
00:58:49,769 --> 00:58:51,646
Sleek-looking, weren't they?

933
00:58:51,849 --> 00:58:53,407
For sure, man. How many?

934
00:58:53,889 --> 00:58:57,768
That's what I'm trying to call up.
Let's see. In Louisiana...

935
00:58:57,969 --> 00:59:00,642
...1 968, we sold....

936
00:59:00,849 --> 00:59:03,488
Doggy! 73 of those little buggers.

937
00:59:03,689 --> 00:59:07,364
You tell me your daddy's name,
I'll tell you where he bought it.

938
00:59:07,609 --> 00:59:10,567
I don't know his name.
That's what I'm trying to find out.

939
00:59:12,009 --> 00:59:16,400
Well, then. The best I can do
is give you a printout...

940
00:59:16,649 --> 00:59:18,765
...of all 73 people
who bought the car.

941
00:59:19,009 --> 00:59:23,366
Later, if you come up with their
last name, you can go on from there.

942
00:59:23,609 --> 00:59:26,840
I'm only doing all of this because
I heard that Buffalo Bob guy...

943
00:59:27,049 --> 00:59:28,880
...shoved a road flare
up your bunghole.

944
00:59:29,089 --> 00:59:30,044
What?

945
00:59:30,449 --> 00:59:31,848
Hoorah.

946
00:59:33,009 --> 00:59:37,241
I keep hearing about him. Nothing
happened with him. Nothing weird.

947
00:59:37,929 --> 00:59:41,285
Anyway, that list had names
from all over the state.

948
00:59:41,529 --> 00:59:43,884
But / was flat broke.
No money for gas.

949
00:59:44,089 --> 00:59:47,798
So / found a job, and that led
to the biggest break in my case yet.

950
00:59:49,089 --> 00:59:50,681
I don't know, Joe.

951
00:59:50,889 --> 00:59:54,643
The way you describe that town
out in the northwest, Silvertown....

952
00:59:54,849 --> 00:59:57,602
Hell, I have half a mind
to move there myself.

953
00:59:58,289 --> 01:00:00,723
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure, honey. Shoot.

954
01:00:01,969 --> 01:00:03,925
Your mom and dad still alive?

955
01:00:04,769 --> 01:00:05,997
No.

956
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:08,200
Did they die?

957
01:00:09,209 --> 01:00:10,608
One night...

958
01:00:11,089 --> 01:00:13,967
...they got swallowed up by
the biggest gator we ever had.

959
01:00:14,169 --> 01:00:15,522
Before they died...

960
01:00:15,729 --> 01:00:18,926
...they killed that gator from
the inside by punching out his heart.

961
01:00:19,129 --> 01:00:20,278
That's brutal.

962
01:00:20,569 --> 01:00:24,039
The brutal part, later that night,
I took my mama's hedge clippers...

963
01:00:24,249 --> 01:00:27,685
...and cut open that gator
and pulled my folks out of its belly.

964
01:00:27,889 --> 01:00:32,041
I couldn't stand the thought of my
parents turning into alligator shit.

965
01:00:33,009 --> 01:00:35,318
God, I hate these nasty things!

966
01:00:38,329 --> 01:00:40,240
If I met the right man...

967
01:00:40,569 --> 01:00:42,321
...l mean, hell, I'd just...

968
01:00:42,609 --> 01:00:45,681
...shut this old gator farm
down and....

969
01:00:47,009 --> 01:00:50,922
But you know, you probably don't want
to hear all my problems, huh?

970
01:00:51,529 --> 01:00:53,804
The gator show's about to start.

971
01:00:54,769 --> 01:00:56,760
I better go. It's showtime.

972
01:00:59,969 --> 01:01:03,518
There's three things to remember
when dealing with a deadly alligator.

973
01:01:03,729 --> 01:01:06,197
And they are deadly.
Don't kid yourself.

974
01:01:06,409 --> 01:01:09,606
Rule number one: I'm number one.

975
01:01:10,209 --> 01:01:11,324
You hear that?

976
01:01:12,009 --> 01:01:16,002
I like to kid around. Rule two, the
croc's number two. Before we begin--

977
01:01:16,209 --> 01:01:17,608
What's rule three?

978
01:01:17,809 --> 01:01:18,878
What's that?

979
01:01:19,169 --> 01:01:20,443
Kid, give me a break, now.

980
01:01:20,689 --> 01:01:21,678
Don't know rule three?

981
01:01:21,889 --> 01:01:25,677
You want a match? My face
and your ass. How about that, friend?

982
01:01:25,929 --> 01:01:27,999
I mean, your ass and my face.

983
01:01:28,289 --> 01:01:29,199
Here we go.

984
01:01:29,409 --> 01:01:32,845
I'm a bit of a crocophile,
so don't try this at home.

985
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:33,839
Don't worry.

986
01:01:34,049 --> 01:01:35,607
This here is Rocky.

987
01:01:36,129 --> 01:01:37,244
And he ain't no puppy.

988
01:01:37,769 --> 01:01:40,124
Let's see if Rocky's
got some cavities.

989
01:01:42,769 --> 01:01:45,237
This mo-fo knows not to mess...

990
01:01:45,529 --> 01:01:47,963
...with Sir Joseph Dirt.

991
01:01:49,089 --> 01:01:51,523
You didn't listen to me!

992
01:01:57,929 --> 01:01:59,362
Come on, now! Rocky!

993
01:02:08,969 --> 01:02:12,439
Oh, when bad pets go bad. Dang!

994
01:02:14,569 --> 01:02:15,684
Are you all right?

995
01:02:21,129 --> 01:02:24,804
It's like the cartoons.
I'm seeing all tweet-tweet.

996
01:02:25,129 --> 01:02:27,404
Joe, what can I do for you?

997
01:02:27,689 --> 01:02:29,566
You're not making any sense.

998
01:02:29,769 --> 01:02:31,327
Not making....

999
01:02:32,329 --> 01:02:33,921
Not making....

1000
01:02:35,369 --> 01:02:38,088
That's why Dad named you Joe Dirt
instead of Nunamaker!

1001
01:02:38,729 --> 01:02:40,128
Nunamaker.

1002
01:02:40,329 --> 01:02:41,728
Nunamaker.

1003
01:02:42,369 --> 01:02:45,247
That's what my sister said
on the way to Grand Canyon.

1004
01:02:45,529 --> 01:02:48,327
My last name is Dirt.
Her last name is Nunamaker.

1005
01:02:48,569 --> 01:02:50,082
That's my parents' last name.

1006
01:02:51,529 --> 01:02:54,760
/ checked my list of Rambler Wagons,
and there it was, Nunamaker...

1007
01:02:54,969 --> 01:02:57,244
...Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

1008
01:02:58,049 --> 01:02:59,448
/ was finally home.

1009
01:03:07,369 --> 01:03:08,324
Sir?

1010
01:03:09,009 --> 01:03:11,807
Mister. You know the people
that live here? Nunamaker?

1011
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:14,044
They moved.

1012
01:03:14,369 --> 01:03:15,324
What's that?

1013
01:03:15,569 --> 01:03:17,480
Moved! They moved.

1014
01:03:17,929 --> 01:03:21,763
About fifteen year ago.
Had a little boy...

1015
01:03:22,209 --> 01:03:24,006
...has that same haircut you got.

1016
01:03:25,289 --> 01:03:26,927
Goddamn, you out-of-date, boy.

1017
01:03:27,329 --> 01:03:29,968
Yeah, man, that little boy, that's me.

1018
01:03:30,369 --> 01:03:32,837
My parents were.... This was my home.

1019
01:03:33,249 --> 01:03:35,319
I thought this was it this time.

1020
01:03:35,569 --> 01:03:37,241
No. Home is where you make it.

1021
01:03:38,049 --> 01:03:39,687
You like to see homos naked?

1022
01:03:41,409 --> 01:03:42,728
Home is where you make it.

1023
01:03:43,209 --> 01:03:45,677
You like to see homos naked.
That's cool.

1024
01:03:45,889 --> 01:03:49,086
No, no, no, no, no.
Home is where you make it.

1025
01:03:49,329 --> 01:03:51,684
Home, where you make it.

1026
01:03:52,649 --> 01:03:55,368
Everybody know that. Goddamn, boy.

1027
01:03:56,649 --> 01:03:59,686
Guy likes to see homos naked.
That don't help me.

1028
01:04:09,249 --> 01:04:11,968
So there / was, right back where
/ started all those years ago...

1029
01:04:12,169 --> 01:04:14,558
...and no closer
to finding my parents.

1030
01:04:17,289 --> 01:04:19,678
/ think a little part of me
died right there.

1031
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:23,006
But you know that saying,
"Things get the darkest before dawn?"

1032
01:04:26,369 --> 01:04:29,600
/ thought / had broken my ass-bone,
so / tried not to move.

1033
01:04:29,809 --> 01:04:31,288
/ lay there, staring at the moon...

1034
01:04:31,529 --> 01:04:35,044
...and for the first time in my life,
/ think about not getting back up.

1035
01:04:35,249 --> 01:04:38,161
Maybe /'ll just lie there
for the rest of my life.

1036
01:04:38,369 --> 01:04:42,123
But then, suddenly,
while staring up at the moon...

1037
01:04:43,249 --> 01:04:45,683
...l had this strange feeling
that exact moment...

1038
01:04:45,889 --> 01:04:49,518
...Brandy was staring at
that same moon. And we were together.

1039
01:04:49,729 --> 01:04:52,084
Just then, all the tumblers
fell into place.

1040
01:04:52,289 --> 01:04:55,804
This door opened in my head.
All at once, / understood everything.

1041
01:04:56,009 --> 01:04:58,159
You have to find the real answer
inside yourself.

1042
01:04:58,369 --> 01:05:01,679
And the answer for me was
that / had a home all along...

1043
01:05:01,889 --> 01:05:04,767
... with a friend who really
cared about me, Brandy.

1044
01:05:04,969 --> 01:05:07,005
/ missed her like crazy,
and / decided...

1045
01:05:07,209 --> 01:05:09,769
... it was time to go home.
My search was over.

1046
01:05:17,809 --> 01:05:20,277
Wish / hadn't gotten a machine.
/t's me, Joe.

1047
01:05:20,529 --> 01:05:22,565
/ got some crazy stuff to tell you.

1048
01:05:22,769 --> 01:05:25,806
But the most important part is,
/'m coming back to Silvertown.

1049
01:05:26,009 --> 01:05:29,319
/ can't wait to see you
and tell you everything. Brandy....

1050
01:05:29,609 --> 01:05:31,327
Message deleted.

1051
01:06:03,849 --> 01:06:07,683
Well, well, well.
If it isn't dirty Joe Dirt.

1052
01:06:07,889 --> 01:06:08,924
What's crappening?

1053
01:06:09,129 --> 01:06:11,689
Don't get smart with me,
you motherless dirt bag.

1054
01:06:12,369 --> 01:06:13,643
You been here long enough.

1055
01:06:13,849 --> 01:06:14,964
I'm here to see Brandy.

1056
01:06:15,169 --> 01:06:16,966
Brandy? My Brandy?

1057
01:06:17,169 --> 01:06:20,081
You haven't heard?
Me and her are getting married.

1058
01:06:20,289 --> 01:06:22,166
Besides, she don't want
to see you anyway.

1059
01:06:22,369 --> 01:06:23,961
-I don't believe that.
-It's true.

1060
01:06:24,449 --> 01:06:26,201
She found your stupid parents.

1061
01:06:26,409 --> 01:06:28,559
-What?
-She found them in California.

1062
01:06:28,809 --> 01:06:30,959
But she didn't want to tell you,
because she wants you gone...

1063
01:06:31,169 --> 01:06:34,047
...out on the road, looking
for nothing, so you won't be here.

1064
01:06:34,249 --> 01:06:36,922
She's sick of all your crap.
She's sick of helping you.

1065
01:06:37,409 --> 01:06:39,684
And she's just plain sick of you.

1066
01:06:39,889 --> 01:06:41,800
She wouldn't do that. I know Brandy.

1067
01:06:42,049 --> 01:06:44,882
She'd tell me about my parents.
I don't care how sick of me she is.

1068
01:06:45,089 --> 01:06:47,364
Check out this note she left me.

1069
01:06:47,609 --> 01:06:49,759
In case you called and I answered.

1070
01:06:51,689 --> 01:06:53,645
" Dear Robbie...

1071
01:06:55,049 --> 01:06:59,600
...if Joe calls, don't tell him...

1072
01:06:59,809 --> 01:07:03,688
...l found his parents.

1073
01:07:04,449 --> 01:07:07,964
I'll be back in a few days."

1074
01:07:08,289 --> 01:07:10,519
See, she signed it
right there. " Brandy."

1075
01:07:10,729 --> 01:07:12,959
"X-O-X-O."

1076
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:14,364
That's right, Dirt.

1077
01:07:14,729 --> 01:07:18,244
Nobody wants you in this town.
Nobody wants you around, period!

1078
01:07:21,649 --> 01:07:23,321
Look at him, fellas.

1079
01:07:23,569 --> 01:07:27,642
You crying, boy? Maybe we'll go
back down to McDonald's...

1080
01:07:27,849 --> 01:07:29,885
...and get you a whamburger
and French cries!

1081
01:07:30,209 --> 01:07:31,961
How about a Whineken!

1082
01:07:32,209 --> 01:07:33,801
You little sissy boy!

1083
01:07:34,209 --> 01:07:35,722
Def Leppard sucks!

1084
01:07:41,729 --> 01:07:44,801
For the record, I wasn't crying.
There was dirt in my eyes.

1085
01:07:45,009 --> 01:07:47,682
Joey, it's not cutting it, man.
It's jive.

1086
01:07:47,889 --> 01:07:50,244
-Everything I just said is true.
-No.

1087
01:07:50,449 --> 01:07:54,522
Brandy. Brandy is jive.
I want to get her on the phone now.

1088
01:07:54,729 --> 01:07:57,960
I want to track her down and ask her
why she was playing games with you.

1089
01:07:58,169 --> 01:07:59,841
No, you don't need to bother her.

1090
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:01,278
Get line 3 on speaker.

1091
01:08:01,489 --> 01:08:06,279
I'm fine. Everything is cool. I got
a place in Malibu, lots of friends.

1092
01:08:06,489 --> 01:08:07,638
I do worry about you.

1093
01:08:07,889 --> 01:08:10,608
Because you're living
in a boiler room, Joe.

1094
01:08:10,809 --> 01:08:11,924
I got a couple places.

1095
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:14,006
You know what, Joey? I think you....

1096
01:08:14,929 --> 01:08:18,763
I can't believe I'm saying--
I think we need some resolution here.

1097
01:08:18,969 --> 01:08:20,288
We need a little closure.

1098
01:08:20,489 --> 01:08:24,164
I want to ask her, "What the hell
was going on back then?"

1099
01:08:24,369 --> 01:08:26,439
Did she find your parents?

1100
01:08:26,689 --> 01:08:30,318
And if she did,
why couldn't she have called you?

1101
01:08:32,849 --> 01:08:35,238
Well, well, well. The famous Brandy.

1102
01:08:35,449 --> 01:08:37,679
Tokyo rose of the trailer park.

1103
01:08:37,889 --> 01:08:40,449
Brandy, I'm sitting here
with a friend of yours.

1104
01:08:40,689 --> 01:08:44,364
A little white-trash treasure
that you might know as Joe Dirt.

1105
01:08:44,609 --> 01:08:45,678
Ring a bell?

1106
01:08:45,889 --> 01:08:47,607
-Joe?
-Yeah, Joe.

1107
01:08:47,809 --> 01:08:50,642
I don't think he wants to talk
to you, Brandy. You know why?

1108
01:08:50,849 --> 01:08:55,047
Because the last few days, my listeners
and I have heard an amazing story.

1109
01:08:55,249 --> 01:08:58,446
When he first started this story,
I thought of you as a good person...

1110
01:08:58,689 --> 01:09:02,967
...but the more it went down the road,
I'm not sure you are a good person.

1111
01:09:03,169 --> 01:09:05,524
Why didn't you tell him
you'd found his parents?

1112
01:09:06,009 --> 01:09:09,046
Oh, my God. How did he find out?

1113
01:09:09,529 --> 01:09:12,805
The letter Robbie showed Joe
is true? You wrote that?

1114
01:09:13,369 --> 01:09:17,601
Yes. / wrote that letter because
/ wanted to tell Joe in person.

1115
01:09:18,689 --> 01:09:20,884
Months went by,
and he never came home.

1116
01:09:21,089 --> 01:09:23,523
Joe, / did find
where your parents were.

1117
01:09:24,489 --> 01:09:27,003
Joe, brace yourself for this.

1118
01:09:29,369 --> 01:09:31,439
Your parents are dead, Joe.

1119
01:09:32,249 --> 01:09:34,479
They died that day
at the Grand Canyon.

1120
01:09:34,729 --> 01:09:37,482
Their car was hit by
a passing truck, a hit and run.

1121
01:09:37,729 --> 01:09:39,640
/'m so sorry.

1122
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:42,279
But your search is over.

1123
01:09:42,489 --> 01:09:46,880
Come home, Joe.
So / can take care of you.

1124
01:09:49,129 --> 01:09:50,482
Oh, man.

1125
01:09:54,969 --> 01:09:56,118
I've got to go.

1126
01:09:56,329 --> 01:09:57,284
Sure.

1127
01:10:02,889 --> 01:10:05,528
All right. We'll take a break.

1128
01:10:16,209 --> 01:10:17,642
He's Joe Dirt!

1129
01:10:29,889 --> 01:10:31,447
You rule, Joe! You rule!

1130
01:10:33,769 --> 01:10:35,805
Joe Dirt, Joe Dirt....

1131
01:10:41,729 --> 01:10:46,007
The phenomenon of Joe Dirt
has captured the city's imagination.

1132
01:10:46,209 --> 01:10:50,122
The little man, the ordinary person
who endured enormous adversity...

1133
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:53,799
...and all the while maintained
his positive outlook on life...

1134
01:10:54,009 --> 01:10:55,727
...teaching us along the way...

1135
01:10:55,929 --> 01:10:58,079
" ...You can't have
'no' in your heart..."

1136
01:10:58,289 --> 01:11:01,008
...and " Life's a garden. Dig it."

1137
01:11:01,209 --> 01:11:05,646
Mr. Dirt is seen here meeting one of
his long-time idols, Eddie Money.

1138
01:11:34,089 --> 01:11:37,968
And welcome back to TRL. We are here
with America's sweetheart, Joe Dirt.

1139
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:39,318
Joe, come back over here.

1140
01:11:39,529 --> 01:11:42,441
We have a show to do here.
People forget we're live.

1141
01:11:42,689 --> 01:11:44,361
You like the window, don't you?

1142
01:11:44,649 --> 01:11:46,924
Before we wrap this up,
anything else you want to say?

1143
01:11:47,129 --> 01:11:51,520
Thanks to the people that stop me
and tell me my story helped them.

1144
01:11:51,769 --> 01:11:55,284
Your story is really cool, like a
Behind the Music without the music.

1145
01:11:55,489 --> 01:12:00,517
Are you depressed? Your parents, who
you'd looked for all along were dead.

1146
01:12:00,769 --> 01:12:02,999
Was the last decade a complete waste?

1147
01:12:03,209 --> 01:12:06,519
No one's really put it like that,
but I don't think so.

1148
01:12:06,769 --> 01:12:10,125
I've had good times, met cool people,
cruised around, cranked some tunes.

1149
01:12:10,329 --> 01:12:12,718
What about Brandy?
Any chance you'll hook back up?

1150
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:18,045
She's a good friend of mine and she's
off doing her own thing right now...

1151
01:12:18,249 --> 01:12:21,047
...but I've always said she's
a little too hot for old Joe Dirt.

1152
01:12:21,369 --> 01:12:22,279
I agree.

1153
01:12:22,489 --> 01:12:26,243
So does America, in our latest
" Is Brandy too hot for Joe Dirt?" poll.

1154
01:12:26,449 --> 01:12:28,007
61 percent of you agreed.

1155
01:12:28,209 --> 01:12:30,882
Even worse, four percent
said the dog was too hot for you.

1156
01:12:31,249 --> 01:12:33,968
I'm just kidding.
You're on TRL California, Joe Dirt.

1157
01:12:34,169 --> 01:12:35,284
Hello, California.

1158
01:12:36,089 --> 01:12:37,408
Hey, wait....

1159
01:12:37,649 --> 01:12:41,847
Am / on? /'m on?!
Hey, baby, /'m on! Yeah.

1160
01:12:42,049 --> 01:12:44,438
Hey, Carson, how big is your Johnny?

1161
01:12:44,649 --> 01:12:47,846
-Happy hour started a little early.
-A little drinky-drinky.

1162
01:12:48,049 --> 01:12:51,928
The reason /'m really calling
is Joe Dirt's parents ain't dead.

1163
01:12:52,129 --> 01:12:55,917
/'m looking at his father
right now and /'m his mama.

1164
01:12:56,129 --> 01:12:58,518
Ma'am, you should never
drink the bong water.

1165
01:12:58,729 --> 01:12:59,923
Yeah. Listen to him.

1166
01:13:00,129 --> 01:13:04,407
Carson, this where you want to be
when Jesus comes back? Making fun--

1167
01:13:04,649 --> 01:13:07,163
-Sorry, Joe.
-Wait. Where's that call coming from?

1168
01:13:07,369 --> 01:13:08,722
California.

1169
01:13:08,929 --> 01:13:09,918
/ got to go.

1170
01:13:11,249 --> 01:13:12,921
So Carson helped me trace the call.

1171
01:13:13,129 --> 01:13:17,202
And it led me to this old trailer park
in Simi Valley, California.

1172
01:13:26,049 --> 01:13:27,198
That's our old car!

1173
01:13:33,889 --> 01:13:37,120
Joe, can I have an exclusive?
Your parents are alive after all?

1174
01:13:39,369 --> 01:13:41,121
Joe, how are you feeling?

1175
01:13:42,049 --> 01:13:44,358
Mom, Dad, is that you?

1176
01:13:46,489 --> 01:13:47,888
Our baby's home.

1177
01:13:48,769 --> 01:13:51,806
We tried so hard to find him.
We looked high and low.

1178
01:13:52,009 --> 01:13:53,488
I got some pictures here. Look.

1179
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:58,007
Here is a picture of Joe when he
was a baby. You get it? Yeah, baby.

1180
01:13:58,209 --> 01:13:59,608
You were a cute baby.

1181
01:13:59,809 --> 01:14:03,802
That's why we were crazy when we lost
him. He's here and now he's gone.

1182
01:14:04,009 --> 01:14:06,045
Where'd he go? Where did he go?

1183
01:14:08,129 --> 01:14:10,723
-They get it? Where'd he go?
-I was at the Canyon.

1184
01:14:10,929 --> 01:14:14,968
Yeah. You know what? It was right
by the garbage can where you left me.

1185
01:14:15,649 --> 01:14:17,480
Is that where you were?

1186
01:14:17,729 --> 01:14:19,128
Well, I'll be dipped.

1187
01:14:19,729 --> 01:14:21,082
The one place we didn't look.

1188
01:14:21,289 --> 01:14:23,757
I knew you looked for me.
I told everybody you would.

1189
01:14:23,969 --> 01:14:26,437
Was there ever a time
you'd look at the moon...

1190
01:14:26,689 --> 01:14:29,806
...and hoped maybe
I was looking at it too?

1191
01:14:30,009 --> 01:14:33,479
I've been doing this clown thing.
Can everybody get a shot of these?

1192
01:14:33,729 --> 01:14:35,321
Do you see these clown figurines?

1193
01:14:35,529 --> 01:14:38,885
Whenever I used to get sad,
I'd just look at a clown.

1194
01:14:39,089 --> 01:14:42,399
-I just can't stop grinning.
-They're available for purchase.

1195
01:14:42,889 --> 01:14:45,483
We're starting this
clown dot-com kind of a thing.

1196
01:14:45,729 --> 01:14:49,358
I don't mean to interrupt
your clown pitch there, but....

1197
01:14:49,929 --> 01:14:54,207
But how exactly do you not go back
to the place where you saw me?

1198
01:14:57,409 --> 01:15:00,446
Hey, how exactly is a rainbow made?

1199
01:15:00,689 --> 01:15:02,327
How exactly does the sun set?

1200
01:15:02,529 --> 01:15:05,885
How exactly does the posi-trac
rear end on a Plymouth work?

1201
01:15:06,169 --> 01:15:08,478
-It just does.
-It just does.

1202
01:15:08,689 --> 01:15:11,442
I'm not talking about posi-trac,
I'm talking about me.

1203
01:15:12,169 --> 01:15:14,888
How long did you look for me
before you gave up?

1204
01:15:15,089 --> 01:15:19,207
How long were you riding in that car
before you realized I wasn't in it?

1205
01:15:26,329 --> 01:15:29,719
All right. We didn't lose him.
We just left him.

1206
01:15:29,929 --> 01:15:31,601
So what? The dude's doing fine!

1207
01:15:31,809 --> 01:15:33,242
Look at him!

1208
01:15:33,649 --> 01:15:37,801
How could you do that to me? I was
only eight, just a little kid.

1209
01:15:38,009 --> 01:15:41,888
Any idea what it's like to be a kid
and have nobody around to talk to...

1210
01:15:42,089 --> 01:15:44,808
...no one that cares
if you're alive or dead?

1211
01:15:45,009 --> 01:15:48,445
Every day you think you're worthless
and there's a void in your life.

1212
01:15:48,689 --> 01:15:50,008
-Come on, honey.
-Lighten up.

1213
01:15:50,209 --> 01:15:51,403
Lose that frown.

1214
01:15:51,649 --> 01:15:54,402
When you're down, stare at a clown.

1215
01:15:54,929 --> 01:15:57,682
Sit down, sit down.
You're blocking the cameras!

1216
01:15:57,889 --> 01:15:59,004
I don't care about that!

1217
01:15:59,209 --> 01:16:01,086
I don't care about you!

1218
01:16:03,489 --> 01:16:06,322
And I don't want to see you
for another 25 years.

1219
01:16:06,529 --> 01:16:10,044
I wish he'd never found us.
Look what he did to my children.

1220
01:16:11,289 --> 01:16:13,723
-Hey, you're grounded!
-Hey, TV people!

1221
01:16:13,929 --> 01:16:17,399
Wait, don't go away! You don't have
to follow just because he's going!

1222
01:16:36,409 --> 01:16:38,161
Somebody do something.

1223
01:16:41,009 --> 01:16:43,807
Joe, just turn around and come down.

1224
01:16:46,169 --> 01:16:47,443
It's not worth it, Joe.

1225
01:16:48,969 --> 01:16:50,322
We are here at Wallace Bridge...

1226
01:16:50,529 --> 01:16:53,726
...where local celebrity Joe Dirt
is threatening to kill himself.

1227
01:16:54,369 --> 01:16:55,324
Come on, Joe.

1228
01:16:55,889 --> 01:16:57,368
Remember what you said on the show?

1229
01:16:57,609 --> 01:16:59,486
" Life's a garden. Dig it."

1230
01:17:00,609 --> 01:17:02,008
You got to get down from there.

1231
01:17:02,209 --> 01:17:04,086
You don't want to do this.

1232
01:17:04,929 --> 01:17:06,521
Why not, man? I got nothing.

1233
01:17:07,009 --> 01:17:09,159
I been looking forever
for those people...

1234
01:17:09,369 --> 01:17:11,439
...and everyone lies to me, man.

1235
01:17:11,849 --> 01:17:12,759
I'm worthless.

1236
01:17:19,329 --> 01:17:21,479
Sorry, lady.
You can't cut through here.

1237
01:17:22,009 --> 01:17:23,283
It's me, Brandy!

1238
01:17:23,489 --> 01:17:25,127
Brandy? Like the Brandy?

1239
01:17:26,049 --> 01:17:27,528
Why didn't you say so? Come on.

1240
01:17:28,329 --> 01:17:31,639
-Hey, everybody, Brandy's here!
-Hey, it's Brandy!

1241
01:17:31,969 --> 01:17:34,085
Look, over there! It's her, Dirt!

1242
01:17:38,209 --> 01:17:39,198
I'm here, Joe.

1243
01:17:39,729 --> 01:17:42,402
You told me my parents were dead,
and I saw them.

1244
01:17:42,649 --> 01:17:44,799
They're horrible. Why did you lie?

1245
01:17:45,129 --> 01:17:49,008
They saw the news when you saved those
kids. They thought you got a reward.

1246
01:17:49,209 --> 01:17:52,121
So you did see them first.
So it's just like Robbie said.

1247
01:17:52,329 --> 01:17:56,208
Yes, but once I met them,
I knew I had to protect you from them.

1248
01:17:56,409 --> 01:18:00,687
They're bad people.
You're not like them, Joe.

1249
01:18:00,889 --> 01:18:05,121
They didn't leave you. You left them.
You've gotta see that.

1250
01:18:05,609 --> 01:18:07,008
Joe, if you'd stayed with them...

1251
01:18:07,729 --> 01:18:09,765
...you wouldn't be
as wonderful as you are.

1252
01:18:09,969 --> 01:18:12,164
But Robbie said
you don't want me around.

1253
01:18:12,369 --> 01:18:15,122
He said you were always
laughing at me behind my back.

1254
01:18:15,329 --> 01:18:19,800
Why would Robbie say such a thing?
Of course that's not true.

1255
01:18:20,169 --> 01:18:23,718
I love you, Joe. With all my heart.

1256
01:18:24,609 --> 01:18:26,998
I want to get married
and have little Joe Dirts.

1257
01:18:27,489 --> 01:18:29,241
Come home, Joe.

1258
01:18:29,449 --> 01:18:32,885
You had a home all along.
You just couldn't see it.

1259
01:18:34,889 --> 01:18:35,878
You really love me?

1260
01:18:42,689 --> 01:18:44,645
I roped him with a bungee cord!

1261
01:19:13,089 --> 01:19:16,001
Oh, man.
I just had the weirdest dream.

1262
01:19:16,209 --> 01:19:19,645
You were in it. And so were you.

1263
01:19:22,249 --> 01:19:24,922
Oh, my God. Brandy, I'm home?

1264
01:19:26,089 --> 01:19:28,364
Clem, Charlene, Kicking Wing?

1265
01:19:28,609 --> 01:19:31,760
It's not Clem anymore.
It's Gert B. Frobe.

1266
01:19:32,169 --> 01:19:33,921
Witness Protection relocated me.

1267
01:19:34,129 --> 01:19:38,168
I asked for Silvertown, after what you
said about it. It's wonderful here.

1268
01:19:38,689 --> 01:19:39,678
Hello, Joe Dirt.

1269
01:19:40,049 --> 01:19:42,643
You taught me to sell the good stuff.

1270
01:19:42,849 --> 01:19:45,409
Now I have 30 fireworks stands...

1271
01:19:45,929 --> 01:19:48,284
...which completely fund
my animal shelters.

1272
01:19:48,489 --> 01:19:49,922
It's all because of you, Joe.

1273
01:19:50,289 --> 01:19:51,324
Good job, brother.

1274
01:19:51,529 --> 01:19:55,841
I sold the gator farm after one of
them snapped off some of my fingers.

1275
01:19:56,049 --> 01:19:58,005
I came up here to check up on you...

1276
01:19:58,209 --> 01:20:01,087
...and I met Gert B. Frobe.

1277
01:20:02,369 --> 01:20:04,883
It's a good thing that gator
didn't get my ring finger...

1278
01:20:05,089 --> 01:20:06,886
...because Gert's asked me
to marry him!

1279
01:20:07,849 --> 01:20:09,248
Right on.

1280
01:20:10,089 --> 01:20:12,523
When you were in the hospital
for your head injury...

1281
01:20:12,729 --> 01:20:16,927
...l had the doctor surgically put on
a wig a little more contemporary.

1282
01:20:28,649 --> 01:20:31,402
Dang. That's cool.

1283
01:20:31,609 --> 01:20:32,564
And Joe...

1284
01:20:33,249 --> 01:20:35,479
-...we have a big surprise for you.
-What's up?

1285
01:20:37,489 --> 01:20:40,083
My Hemi!
You got it out of hock for me?

1286
01:20:41,929 --> 01:20:44,568
-Somebody else wants to get in here.
-Who's that?

1287
01:20:45,089 --> 01:20:46,886
Come on, boy! Come on!

1288
01:20:47,969 --> 01:20:49,038
Looks like Charlie.

1289
01:20:49,249 --> 01:20:51,046
Apparently, back in the day...

1290
01:20:51,249 --> 01:20:54,241
...Charlie had a little sexual
encounter with this one's ma.

1291
01:20:54,449 --> 01:20:56,360
Say hello to Charlie Two.

1292
01:20:56,649 --> 01:20:57,604
Good boy.

1293
01:20:58,129 --> 01:21:01,439
You got a big family now, Joe Dirt.
You better be good to us.

1294
01:21:01,689 --> 01:21:02,644
Oh, I will.

1295
01:21:09,249 --> 01:21:13,720
Hey, Dirt. I thought I told you,
buddy. Nobody wants you around.

1296
01:21:15,689 --> 01:21:18,123
You're talking all wrong.
It's the wrong tone.

1297
01:21:18,449 --> 01:21:21,680
Do it again, I'll stab you
in the face with a soldering iron.

1298
01:21:22,289 --> 01:21:24,598
-You're his dad?
-What if I am?

1299
01:21:26,289 --> 01:21:27,768
What if we're his family?

1300
01:21:31,929 --> 01:21:33,965
At least my car'll
blow his off the road.

1301
01:21:34,169 --> 01:21:38,959
You think you can match that little
slant 6 of yours against his 426 Hemi?

1302
01:21:39,849 --> 01:21:41,999
Then let's do it, little boy!

1303
01:21:42,249 --> 01:21:43,238
That's my girl.

1304
01:21:44,209 --> 01:21:45,608
-Let's ride, Dirt-boy.
-Let's go!

1305
01:22:04,289 --> 01:22:07,361
Now it's time for the good stuff.

1306
01:22:07,649 --> 01:22:08,798
Yeah! Light her up!

1307
01:22:11,889 --> 01:22:15,040
This next song goes out to our
good friend, Joe Dirt, the Dirt-man.

1308
01:22:15,249 --> 01:22:17,604
Wherever you are,
this is for you, buddy.

1309
01:22:17,809 --> 01:22:20,562
Welcome home, Joe.
Welcome home.
