1
00:01:47,496 --> 00:01:48,797
- So, how was I?

2
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:50,967
- Sorry.

3
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:53,602
- I mean, sexually,
was I any good?
- Ummm

4
00:01:53,635 --> 00:01:55,238
- I mean, I know you probably
didn't think I was good,

5
00:01:55,271 --> 00:01:58,341
but well, did you think
I was at least average?

6
00:01:58,375 --> 00:01:59,608
How many men have you
been with, by the way?

7
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:01,011
- I don't think it
lasted long enough

8
00:02:01,044 --> 00:02:02,544
for me to have
much of an opinion,

9
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:05,148
although in general
not lasting long enough

10
00:02:05,181 --> 00:02:07,417
to leave an impression
is usually a bad sign.

11
00:02:08,817 --> 00:02:10,020
- Well, that's one
way of looking at it.

12
00:02:10,053 --> 00:02:11,520
- Name another.

13
00:02:11,553 --> 00:02:13,423
- Didn't last long enough
for me to make any mistakes.

14
00:02:13,456 --> 00:02:14,757
- It wouldn't go that far.

15
00:02:15,992 --> 00:02:16,792
- Okay.

16
00:02:16,825 --> 00:02:17,760
- You asked.

17
00:02:17,793 --> 00:02:19,162
- Well, only because I
thought you'd be gentle.

18
00:02:19,195 --> 00:02:20,997
Do you have any
constructive criticism?

19
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:21,931
I mean, things I can fix.

20
00:02:21,965 --> 00:02:22,932
- How about some small talk?

21
00:02:22,966 --> 00:02:24,867
- I can't fix my penis.

22
00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:26,602
- Are you being clever?

23
00:02:26,635 --> 00:02:27,836
- Self deprecating.

24
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,040
I've been told some
women find it charming.

25
00:02:30,073 --> 00:02:30,907
- Right.

26
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:34,610
Have you seen any
good movies lately?

27
00:02:34,643 --> 00:02:35,778
- Small talk it is.

28
00:02:35,811 --> 00:02:37,679
- I saw this one film last week,

29
00:02:37,713 --> 00:02:40,417
"To Gesbar from
Guinevere", was brilliant.

30
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:41,518
Have you seen it?

31
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,786
- Seen it? I
practically wrote it.

32
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:44,988
- Really?

33
00:02:45,021 --> 00:02:47,057
How does one practically
write something?

34
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,059
- Well, I came up with the idea.

35
00:02:49,092 --> 00:02:51,194
- You have a story by credit.

36
00:02:51,227 --> 00:02:53,363
- No, I came up with
the idea separately.

37
00:02:53,396 --> 00:02:55,465
- Separately,
separately from what?

38
00:02:55,498 --> 00:02:56,632
- From Alan Davidson.

39
00:02:56,665 --> 00:02:57,566
- Who's Alan Davidson?

40
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,968
- The writer.

41
00:02:59,002 --> 00:03:00,602
- So, you didn't write it?

42
00:03:00,636 --> 00:03:02,704
- Not with Davidson,
I wrote it separately.

43
00:03:04,074 --> 00:03:05,408
- Are you credited?

44
00:03:06,276 --> 00:03:08,445
- Maybe I'm being confusing.

45
00:03:08,478 --> 00:03:10,380
Look, it was a case
of parallel thinking

46
00:03:10,413 --> 00:03:11,915
and Davidson and
I have never met

47
00:03:11,948 --> 00:03:13,782
yet we both had the
same idea for a story

48
00:03:13,816 --> 00:03:17,187
and separately from one
another wrote said story.

49
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,657
- So you both had
an idea for a film

50
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,592
about a girl who falls
in love with her father.

51
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:26,196
- Well, in my version, the love
interest wasn't her father.

52
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:27,030
- Who was it?

53
00:03:27,063 --> 00:03:28,231
- Just a man.

54
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:33,802
- So it was a story about a girl

55
00:03:33,836 --> 00:03:37,040
who falls in love with a man,

56
00:03:37,073 --> 00:03:38,640
a man who wasn't her father.

57
00:03:38,674 --> 00:03:39,509
- Yeah.

58
00:03:42,145 --> 00:03:44,514
Upon hearing it aloud,

59
00:03:44,547 --> 00:03:48,051
I see how that may sound
somewhat dissimilar

60
00:03:48,084 --> 00:03:49,919
from Davidson's final film.

61
00:03:49,953 --> 00:03:51,387
But if you read my treatment,

62
00:03:53,256 --> 00:03:56,559
well, there's more
similarities in the story beats

63
00:03:56,593 --> 00:03:57,793
and things like that.

64
00:04:01,264 --> 00:04:05,734
You know, I did consider
having the love incestuous.

65
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:08,905
Incestuous love can be quite
provocative if done tastefully.

66
00:04:08,938 --> 00:04:10,073
- Why didn't you?

67
00:04:10,106 --> 00:04:11,040
- Kept having this
idea that my own father

68
00:04:11,074 --> 00:04:12,008
would see the film.

69
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,209
- And?

70
00:04:13,243 --> 00:04:15,145
- And I don't know,
he'd get the wrong idea.

71
00:04:16,446 --> 00:04:17,880
- What idea?

72
00:04:17,914 --> 00:04:20,283
- I don't know that maybe I had
a crush on him or something.

73
00:04:21,683 --> 00:04:22,818
- Ew.

74
00:04:22,851 --> 00:04:24,887
- I know, well,
that's why I made sure

75
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:27,290
the love interest
was not her father.

76
00:04:27,323 --> 00:04:30,460
Honestly, I wonder about
Davidson sometimes,

77
00:04:30,493 --> 00:04:32,262
I wonder what his father
thinks of his work.

78
00:04:32,295 --> 00:04:34,696
- Right, do you mind if I smoke?

79
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,299
- It's not a deal breaker, no.

80
00:04:37,634 --> 00:04:39,735
Oh, you meant in here?

81
00:04:48,744 --> 00:04:50,246
I was thinking
about your problem.

82
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,514
- What problem?

83
00:04:51,548 --> 00:04:54,284
- You know your problem.

84
00:04:55,385 --> 00:04:56,553
- What about it?

85
00:04:56,586 --> 00:04:58,021
- Well, I think I
might have a solution.

86
00:04:58,054 --> 00:04:59,255
- Oh.

87
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:03,593
- Yeah, But it's odd
and semi unbelievable.

88
00:05:03,626 --> 00:05:05,128
- Okay.

89
00:05:05,161 --> 00:05:07,363
- All right, how do you feel
about your current reality?

90
00:05:07,397 --> 00:05:08,998
- Is that a rhetorical question?

91
00:05:09,032 --> 00:05:11,767
- Would I pause for
an answer if it was?

92
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,036
- Like you did just that.

93
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:14,537
- That was more of
a dramatic pause.

94
00:05:14,571 --> 00:05:15,371
- Disillusioned.

95
00:05:15,405 --> 00:05:16,838
- A disillusioned pause.

96
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:18,041
- I wasn't correcting
you, I was answering you,

97
00:05:18,074 --> 00:05:20,009
I feel disillusioned
by my reality.

98
00:05:20,043 --> 00:05:21,144
- Right, well, that's good.

99
00:05:21,177 --> 00:05:22,412
- Is it?

100
00:05:22,445 --> 00:05:23,980
- Good for the purposes
of solving your problem.

101
00:05:24,013 --> 00:05:25,248
- Right, so the solution is.

102
00:05:25,281 --> 00:05:26,848
- The solution is.

103
00:05:28,284 --> 00:05:29,619
Will you remind me
of the problem again?

104
00:05:29,652 --> 00:05:31,221
- You have a solution
to my problem,

105
00:05:31,254 --> 00:05:32,788
but you don't remember
what my problem is?

106
00:05:32,821 --> 00:05:35,692
- I remember that
you have a problem,

107
00:05:35,724 --> 00:05:38,194
and that's the great
thing about my solution.

108
00:05:38,228 --> 00:05:40,230
It's 100% effective
against any problem.

109
00:05:41,164 --> 00:05:43,933
- Right, and Ken, how is
your relationship to reality?

110
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:44,766
- Tenuous.

111
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,635
- Sounds that way.

112
00:05:47,237 --> 00:05:51,207
- So, do you wanna hear my
100% fully guaranteed solution

113
00:05:51,241 --> 00:05:52,175
of any problem?

114
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,643
- If you say, Jesus
Christ, I'm leaving.

115
00:05:53,676 --> 00:05:55,378
- Don't worry, I'm an atheist.

116
00:05:56,446 --> 00:05:58,014
Actually more
accurately a nihilist

117
00:05:58,047 --> 00:06:00,183
and I think you're already
planning on leaving anyway.

118
00:06:00,216 --> 00:06:02,318
- It's nothing personal,
just if I can't smoke here.

119
00:06:02,352 --> 00:06:03,819
- And if I told you you
could, would you stay?

120
00:06:03,852 --> 00:06:06,456
- I'd probably still leave
just with the worst excuse.

121
00:06:06,489 --> 00:06:07,423
- You don't like me?

122
00:06:07,457 --> 00:06:08,258
- We just met.

123
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,192
- 10 Hours ago.

124
00:06:09,225 --> 00:06:10,460
- We slept for four
of those hours.

125
00:06:10,493 --> 00:06:11,961
- So that's even
more impressive.

126
00:06:11,995 --> 00:06:13,862
It only took me six hours
to realize I liked you.

127
00:06:13,896 --> 00:06:15,665
- Took me six seconds.

128
00:06:15,698 --> 00:06:17,166
- I think they call that
love at first sight.

129
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,768
- Six seconds to
realize you liked me.

130
00:06:19,801 --> 00:06:22,705
I think they call that
premature ejaculation.

131
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:25,008
- Okay, I feel like you want
me to apologize for that

132
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,542
being that it's the second
time you've brought it up.

133
00:06:26,576 --> 00:06:28,411
- No need, I'm a
theoretical physicist,

134
00:06:28,444 --> 00:06:30,980
I don't believe in
the concept of time.

135
00:06:31,014 --> 00:06:36,019
- Oh, well, I'm a nihilist,
I don't believe in anything.

136
00:06:36,885 --> 00:06:37,819
- That must be convenient.

137
00:06:37,853 --> 00:06:38,787
- I can't complain,

138
00:06:39,922 --> 00:06:41,724
but only because that's
not something nihilist do.

139
00:06:41,758 --> 00:06:42,692
- Yeah, no, I got it.

140
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:44,260
Ken, have you seen my necklace?

141
00:06:46,763 --> 00:06:48,097
- Not over here?

142
00:06:48,131 --> 00:06:49,332
- It's gold with a diamond.

143
00:06:49,365 --> 00:06:51,234
- If I see a necklace,
I'll assume it's yours.

144
00:06:51,267 --> 00:06:52,435
- You don't get many visitors?

145
00:06:52,468 --> 00:06:53,670
- Not many would take
their clothes off.

146
00:06:53,703 --> 00:06:55,438
- Your dad has been
around in a while?

147
00:06:56,739 --> 00:06:57,940
- Was that a joke?

148
00:06:57,974 --> 00:06:59,841
- Maybe not if I were
talking to Davidson.

149
00:07:01,244 --> 00:07:02,979
That was a joke.

150
00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:04,813
- Right, I forgot you
were a psych major.

151
00:07:04,846 --> 00:07:06,449
- You did forget, minor.

152
00:07:07,617 --> 00:07:08,685
Remember last night
you told your friends

153
00:07:08,718 --> 00:07:10,019
you were gonna go through

154
00:07:10,053 --> 00:07:11,321
all of Freud's developmental
stages with me?

155
00:07:11,354 --> 00:07:13,189
- No, but those are.

156
00:07:13,222 --> 00:07:16,459
- Oral, anal and phallic.

157
00:07:16,492 --> 00:07:17,460
- Oh, yikes.

158
00:07:17,493 --> 00:07:18,795
- Yeah, all for three.

159
00:07:18,827 --> 00:07:19,861
- Sorry about that.

160
00:07:19,896 --> 00:07:21,931
- Again, no need to apologize,

161
00:07:21,964 --> 00:07:23,832
although that is an
offensive stereotype.

162
00:07:23,865 --> 00:07:25,234
- Premature ejaculation?

163
00:07:25,268 --> 00:07:27,503
- Psychologist being obsessed
with edible instincts.

164
00:07:27,537 --> 00:07:28,738
- I thought edible instincts

165
00:07:28,771 --> 00:07:30,606
were only when you
wanna bang your mom.

166
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,608
Also, you were the one
who brought up my dad.

167
00:07:32,642 --> 00:07:35,178
- And you were the
one who linked it back
to my sex studies.

168
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:37,413
- Do you not like me because
you don't know enough about me?

169
00:07:37,447 --> 00:07:38,348
- Sorry.

170
00:07:38,381 --> 00:07:39,582
- You said you just met me,

171
00:07:39,615 --> 00:07:40,882
that would indicate
that you don't like me

172
00:07:40,917 --> 00:07:42,785
because you don't
really know me.

173
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:44,020
- Sure.

174
00:07:44,053 --> 00:07:45,188
- Okay, so let me tell
you a bit about myself.

175
00:07:45,221 --> 00:07:46,122
- I'd really rather
if you didn't.

176
00:07:46,155 --> 00:07:47,457
- It's the only way we'll know.

177
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:48,324
- Know what?

178
00:07:49,726 --> 00:07:51,594
- We're meant to be together.

179
00:07:51,627 --> 00:07:54,230
- I'm getting the sneaking
suspicion that we aren't.

180
00:07:58,935 --> 00:08:01,437
- Well see, that's
important for me to know.

181
00:08:01,471 --> 00:08:02,839
- Did you look
underneath the covers?

182
00:08:02,871 --> 00:08:04,974
- It's not there, I
have a peanut allergy.

183
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:08,311
- Are those two
sentences related?

184
00:08:08,344 --> 00:08:09,912
- I wanna tell you
more about myself.

185
00:08:09,946 --> 00:08:11,147
I have a peanut allergy,

186
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,382
I'm a grad student in
the film department.

187
00:08:12,415 --> 00:08:13,316
When I was eight years old

188
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:14,550
I peed my pants at a magic show.

189
00:08:14,584 --> 00:08:15,952
- You're a grad student?

190
00:08:15,985 --> 00:08:17,487
- Didn't really expect
that's what you'd latch onto.

191
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,355
- Are grad students supposed
to sleep with undergrad?

192
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:20,590
- It's not a requirement, no.

193
00:08:20,623 --> 00:08:21,691
- Is it frowned upon?

194
00:08:21,724 --> 00:08:23,025
- Why would it be?

195
00:08:23,059 --> 00:08:24,127
- Age difference?

196
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,995
- Coming from the girl who
doesn't believe in time.

197
00:08:26,028 --> 00:08:27,964
- That was a reference to
the way we experience entropy

198
00:08:27,997 --> 00:08:30,066
and not an excuse
for pedophilia.

199
00:08:30,099 --> 00:08:32,769
- Pedophilia, how old are you?

200
00:08:32,802 --> 00:08:35,438
- Relax, I was being
hyperbolic, I'm 22,

201
00:08:37,974 --> 00:08:40,643
- 23, what's entropy?

202
00:08:41,778 --> 00:08:42,578
- A measurement.

203
00:08:42,612 --> 00:08:43,479
- Of what?

204
00:08:43,513 --> 00:08:44,781
- Molecular disorder.

205
00:08:44,814 --> 00:08:46,249
- My friend had a
molecular disorder.

206
00:08:46,282 --> 00:08:50,052
- No, not a molecular
disorder, just disorder,

207
00:08:50,086 --> 00:08:51,754
randomness, uncertainty.

208
00:08:51,788 --> 00:08:53,790
- So, in relation to time.

209
00:08:53,823 --> 00:08:54,824
- A few moments ago,

210
00:08:54,857 --> 00:08:55,893
you said you thought
you should apologize,

211
00:08:55,925 --> 00:08:57,927
apologize for what?

212
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,462
- Not lasting longer.

213
00:08:59,495 --> 00:09:03,699
- Right, and by lasting
longer, what do you mean?

214
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:04,834
- You need me to explain that?

215
00:09:04,867 --> 00:09:06,169
- Well, it's actually
not so clear.

216
00:09:06,202 --> 00:09:07,370
See, the amount of time

217
00:09:07,403 --> 00:09:08,604
that we spend having
sex is relative,

218
00:09:08,638 --> 00:09:10,106
but it's relative
only to itself.

219
00:09:11,274 --> 00:09:15,178
So for example, time
moves slightly faster

220
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:16,379
at higher altitudes,

221
00:09:16,412 --> 00:09:18,114
we're at about sea
level here in Hoboken,

222
00:09:18,147 --> 00:09:20,950
but if we drove upstate to
Mount Marcy or somewhere

223
00:09:20,983 --> 00:09:23,319
and had sex on top of a
mountain that's like 5,000 feet,

224
00:09:23,352 --> 00:09:25,087
so technically
we'd be having sex

225
00:09:25,121 --> 00:09:26,222
for a shorter amount of time,

226
00:09:26,255 --> 00:09:27,490
but that wouldn't make you feel

227
00:09:27,523 --> 00:09:28,892
like you lasted any
longer at sea level

228
00:09:28,926 --> 00:09:30,092
because that's not the type

229
00:09:30,126 --> 00:09:32,161
of lasting longer you're
referencing, is it?

230
00:09:34,664 --> 00:09:37,233
- Mount Marcy's in Keen, right?

231
00:09:37,266 --> 00:09:39,769
That's like, it's like
a four hour drive,

232
00:09:39,802 --> 00:09:41,003
I have class at 9:00.

233
00:09:41,037 --> 00:09:42,371
- It's not a proposition, Ken,

234
00:09:42,405 --> 00:09:43,739
the point I'm making

235
00:09:43,773 --> 00:09:45,909
is that we can discuss
theoretical properties of time,

236
00:09:45,943 --> 00:09:46,843
but that won't affect the way

237
00:09:46,876 --> 00:09:48,277
that we actually relate to them.

238
00:09:48,311 --> 00:09:51,180
- So, you're saying.

239
00:09:51,214 --> 00:09:53,115
- So I'm saying I can understand

240
00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:54,650
how when Newtonian
classical mechanics

241
00:09:54,684 --> 00:09:57,353
that past and the future are
both theoretically knowable.

242
00:09:57,386 --> 00:09:58,488
- You can see the future?

243
00:09:58,521 --> 00:09:59,789
- Theoretically, yeah.

244
00:09:59,822 --> 00:10:00,990
- Practically?

245
00:10:01,023 --> 00:10:02,792
- Practically no, but
the reason I can't

246
00:10:02,825 --> 00:10:05,027
isn't so simple as, because
it hasn't happened yet.

247
00:10:05,061 --> 00:10:07,263
The only thing pushing times
zero forward is entropy,

248
00:10:07,296 --> 00:10:09,265
and besides that,
there's no reason why

249
00:10:09,298 --> 00:10:10,901
where we've been should
be any more vivid

250
00:10:10,934 --> 00:10:12,435
than where we're going.

251
00:10:12,468 --> 00:10:14,570
But unfortunately, the past
is an area of lower entropy.

252
00:10:14,604 --> 00:10:15,939
- Why is that unfortunate?

253
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:23,646
- Well, maybe it
isn't universally,

254
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:26,215
but I for one, I'm not in love

255
00:10:26,249 --> 00:10:27,951
with being irrevocably
linked in my past,

256
00:10:27,985 --> 00:10:31,254
that seems like a waste of
perfectly good low entropy,

257
00:10:31,287 --> 00:10:32,555
I'd much rather see
where I'm going,

258
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:33,991
especially when I don't
have much in the way

259
00:10:34,023 --> 00:10:36,158
of things worth remembering.

260
00:10:36,192 --> 00:10:38,628
- Well, you haven't heard
the magic show story yet?

261
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,298
- Okay, tell me.

262
00:10:45,635 --> 00:10:50,606
- Well, no, no, now
there's too much pressure.

263
00:10:50,773 --> 00:10:52,675
I mean, it's good,
but not so good

264
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:56,212
that it'll cure your weird
existential quantum depression.

265
00:10:57,113 --> 00:10:59,482
- Right, I should get going.

266
00:11:01,183 --> 00:11:03,386
- So, you still don't like me?

267
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:04,320
- It's really uncomfortable

268
00:11:04,353 --> 00:11:05,354
that you keep asking me that.

269
00:11:05,388 --> 00:11:08,658
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, okay?

270
00:11:08,691 --> 00:11:11,193
But imagine if we did just make

271
00:11:11,227 --> 00:11:12,361
small talk the whole morning?

272
00:11:12,395 --> 00:11:14,163
If we just talked about
movies for an hour

273
00:11:14,196 --> 00:11:16,900
and not even incestuous
ones, boring ones,

274
00:11:16,934 --> 00:11:18,969
I'd try calling you
tonight and tomorrow

275
00:11:19,002 --> 00:11:20,503
and then wait a
week and try again.

276
00:11:20,536 --> 00:11:22,039
- That's alarming.

277
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:24,840
- The point is, I'd wonder
why you weren't answering.

278
00:11:24,874 --> 00:11:26,842
I'd say, gee, that's
odd, Sid had a really.

279
00:11:26,876 --> 00:11:27,911
- Sydney.

280
00:11:27,945 --> 00:11:28,744
- Sorry.

281
00:11:28,778 --> 00:11:30,746
- My name is Sydney.

282
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,281
- You said your
friends called you Sid.

283
00:11:32,315 --> 00:11:33,149
- They do.

284
00:11:35,284 --> 00:11:38,788
- Right, well, I'd
say, gee, that's odd,

285
00:11:38,821 --> 00:11:41,992
Sydney seemed to have a
really great time last night.

286
00:11:42,025 --> 00:11:45,194
We had a great discussion
about German expressionism.

287
00:11:45,227 --> 00:11:46,395
Now I know that
you don't like me

288
00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:47,697
and I shouldn't waste my time.

289
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,066
- Oh yeah, God forbid you waste

290
00:11:49,098 --> 00:11:51,167
another three seconds with me.

291
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,536
- You're a liar, you
totally believe in time.

292
00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:55,204
- Okay, well, you're a liar too,

293
00:11:55,237 --> 00:11:56,405
you said you're a nihilist
and you clearly care

294
00:11:56,439 --> 00:11:57,573
whether I like you or not.

295
00:11:57,607 --> 00:11:59,575
- I'm a nihilist, but
I'm also a romantic,

296
00:11:59,609 --> 00:12:00,776
I can't help it.

297
00:12:06,115 --> 00:12:08,718
Your necklace is on my dresser.

298
00:12:26,003 --> 00:12:27,503
- Can I see it?

299
00:12:34,978 --> 00:12:36,612
Is the diamond real?

300
00:12:36,646 --> 00:12:38,414
- I don't know, it was a gift.

301
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:49,225
- Notice how it fogs
up from my breath

302
00:12:49,258 --> 00:12:50,393
Diamonds don't fog.

303
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:54,931
- Did someone tell
you that was charming?

304
00:12:55,999 --> 00:12:56,866
- It wasn't.

305
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,068
- I don't like you, Ken.

306
00:12:59,402 --> 00:13:00,569
- I pretty much shielded, huh?

307
00:13:00,603 --> 00:13:01,737
- I mean, you
weren't doing great,

308
00:13:01,771 --> 00:13:03,706
but that was definitely
the cherry on top.

309
00:13:21,124 --> 00:13:22,725
So, what's your solution?

310
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:23,592
- Sorry.

311
00:13:26,897 --> 00:13:29,331
- It's my problem,
what's your solution?

312
00:13:29,365 --> 00:13:30,433
- Jesus Christ.

313
00:13:30,466 --> 00:13:31,367
- What did I say?

314
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,703
- That was an exclamation,
not an answer.

315
00:13:33,736 --> 00:13:34,670
Have you seen my keys?

316
00:13:34,704 --> 00:13:36,173
- I haven't, but if I see some,

317
00:13:36,205 --> 00:13:38,207
I'll be sure to breathe on
them to see if they're real.

318
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,575
- That only works on diamonds.

319
00:13:39,608 --> 00:13:40,810
- And fake diamonds.

320
00:13:40,843 --> 00:13:42,411
- There's no shame in
having fake diamonds.

321
00:13:42,445 --> 00:13:44,915
- Oh, trust me, on the
long list of things

322
00:13:44,948 --> 00:13:46,183
currently causing
me to feel shame,

323
00:13:46,215 --> 00:13:48,317
my fake diamond necklace
is at the bottom.

324
00:13:49,485 --> 00:13:50,319
- All right.

325
00:13:56,525 --> 00:13:58,061
I know how you got the answers.

326
00:13:58,095 --> 00:13:58,929
- Excuse me.

327
00:14:01,098 --> 00:14:03,066
- I know how you
got the answers.

328
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:05,102
I know your problem.

329
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,436
You're getting
kicked outta school

330
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,804
for cheating on an exam.

331
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,340
- I know, I told
you that last night

332
00:14:11,373 --> 00:14:13,275
and you pretended you didn't
remember this morning.

333
00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:16,146
- Yeah, well, something
jogged my memory.

334
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:20,316
But what you didn't tell me
is how you got the answers.

335
00:14:20,349 --> 00:14:21,350
- How'd I do that?

336
00:14:22,518 --> 00:14:24,353
- Through blackmail,
Professor Slack.

337
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:27,224
- How do you know that?

338
00:14:28,624 --> 00:14:31,194
- Do you wanna know my
solution to your problem?

339
00:14:36,565 --> 00:14:38,734
My bathroom is a
unique structure

340
00:14:38,768 --> 00:14:40,971
that links disparate
points in space time.

341
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,078
- That's where
you're going with?

342
00:14:48,111 --> 00:14:49,745
Your solution to
my cheating scandal

343
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:52,715
is that your bathroom
is a wormhole?

344
00:14:52,748 --> 00:14:54,251
- Yes.

345
00:14:54,283 --> 00:14:55,618
- Is this a physics joke?

346
00:14:55,651 --> 00:14:56,685
- Wouldn't be very funny.

347
00:14:56,719 --> 00:14:58,221
- Well see, your jokes aren't.

348
00:14:58,255 --> 00:15:01,390
- Listen Sydney, this is a
solution to your problem,

349
00:15:01,423 --> 00:15:02,758
to all your problems.

350
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:04,194
I know it sounds crazy,

351
00:15:04,227 --> 00:15:07,130
but this was actually discovered
by an expert in the field.

352
00:15:07,164 --> 00:15:09,099
- An expert in the
field of quantum physics

353
00:15:09,132 --> 00:15:10,866
discovered this
in your bathroom.

354
00:15:10,901 --> 00:15:11,968
- Yep.

355
00:15:12,002 --> 00:15:14,570
- Who? Einstein, Thorn?

356
00:15:14,603 --> 00:15:15,704
- You did.

357
00:15:15,738 --> 00:15:16,872
- Sorry.

358
00:15:16,907 --> 00:15:18,741
- You figured it out.

359
00:15:18,774 --> 00:15:20,743
- Really? I did, when?

360
00:15:20,776 --> 00:15:22,279
- Two weeks ago.

361
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:24,380
- Two weeks ago, we
met last night, Ken.

362
00:15:24,413 --> 00:15:27,117
- Yeah, we did, here.

363
00:15:28,285 --> 00:15:29,920
But as I'm sure you are aware,

364
00:15:29,953 --> 00:15:31,387
and I mean that literally,

365
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,191
I'm sure you are aware
that all possible outcomes

366
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,993
are realized in the many
world's interpretation.

367
00:15:37,027 --> 00:15:40,830
So, there exists a world
where we met last night,

368
00:15:40,863 --> 00:15:42,631
a world where we
met a month ago,

369
00:15:42,665 --> 00:15:44,567
a world where we'll
meet tomorrow,

370
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,269
a world where you like me
and a world where you don't.

371
00:15:46,303 --> 00:15:48,504
- A world where I think
you're a crazy person.

372
00:15:48,537 --> 00:15:49,738
- Exactly.

373
00:15:49,772 --> 00:15:51,007
- But you live in
that world, Ken,

374
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,541
not the world where
we met two weeks ago

375
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,343
and I was nice enough to check
your bathroom for wormholes.

376
00:15:54,376 --> 00:15:57,546
- Traversable wormholes,
and yes, I did.

377
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,515
I'm here now, but I'm
from somewhere else.

378
00:15:59,548 --> 00:16:01,417
- Right, as easy as it
is for me to believe

379
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,818
that you're from a
different universe,

380
00:16:02,852 --> 00:16:05,387
I'm still a little
skeptical on the concept.

381
00:16:05,421 --> 00:16:06,655
- I'd let you give it a try

382
00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:09,025
but the results are
rather permanent.

383
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:10,026
Once you go in, you have to know

384
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,161
you're never coming back here.

385
00:16:11,194 --> 00:16:13,296
- Something you grappled with.

386
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:16,599
- No, no, for me it was
a rather simple decision.

387
00:16:16,632 --> 00:16:20,203
- Of course, and this
solves my problem how?

388
00:16:21,338 --> 00:16:23,907
- All possible
outcomes are realized.

389
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,342
To me, that was just a saying,

390
00:16:25,374 --> 00:16:27,710
just a way to think
about the multiverse

391
00:16:27,743 --> 00:16:30,613
until I saw "To
Gesbar from Guinevere"

392
00:16:30,646 --> 00:16:32,249
and I realized something,

393
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,217
that could have been me.

394
00:16:34,251 --> 00:16:36,086
- Who? Gesbar or Guinevere.

395
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:37,519
- Davidson.

396
00:16:37,553 --> 00:16:39,722
I could have been Davidson.

397
00:16:39,755 --> 00:16:42,424
If all possible outcomes
exist in the multiverse,

398
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:45,761
there exists a universe where
I made the love incestuous

399
00:16:45,794 --> 00:16:48,864
and I wrote "To Gesbar
from Guinevere".

400
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:49,865
- Wow.

401
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,733
- I know.

402
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:53,435
And not just that,

403
00:16:53,469 --> 00:16:56,206
the possibilities are
legitimately endless.

404
00:16:56,239 --> 00:16:57,773
I buy a lottery ticket here,

405
00:16:57,806 --> 00:16:59,541
there automatically
exists a universe

406
00:16:59,575 --> 00:17:01,144
where I win the jackpot,

407
00:17:01,177 --> 00:17:02,544
all I need to do is find it.

408
00:17:03,746 --> 00:17:07,117
- So your idea is for
me to find a universe

409
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,585
where I didn't cheat and
get kicked outta school?

410
00:17:09,618 --> 00:17:11,453
- If that's what you want.

411
00:17:11,487 --> 00:17:12,688
But I mean, why settle for that?

412
00:17:12,721 --> 00:17:13,889
Maybe there's a universe

413
00:17:13,924 --> 00:17:15,959
where you're getting
your PhD at MIT.

414
00:17:15,992 --> 00:17:18,794
Maybe there's a universe
where you're the next Freud,

415
00:17:18,827 --> 00:17:21,031
if that's a good thing,
I don't really know.

416
00:17:22,265 --> 00:17:24,134
Either way, you'll need this.

417
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:25,601
- What the fuck, Ken?

418
00:17:25,634 --> 00:17:26,435
- What?

419
00:17:26,468 --> 00:17:27,770
- Why do you need
the fucking gun?

420
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:29,538
- Well, once you get
to the right universe

421
00:17:29,571 --> 00:17:30,773
and find a place you wanna stay,

422
00:17:30,806 --> 00:17:33,276
you can't live with yourself.

423
00:17:34,144 --> 00:17:35,444
- The guilt?

424
00:17:35,477 --> 00:17:36,313
- Huh? No.

425
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,349
I mean you literally
can't live with yourself.

426
00:17:39,382 --> 00:17:40,616
- Ken.

427
00:17:40,649 --> 00:17:42,785
- You need to kill yourself.

428
00:17:42,818 --> 00:17:44,321
- Because of the guilt?

429
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,822
- No, Sydney, not because
of the guilt, not suicide,

430
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:48,657
you need to kill
your other self.

431
00:17:50,026 --> 00:17:52,861
Look, that bathroom
works both ways.

432
00:17:52,896 --> 00:17:54,630
Just like I wanna
find somewhere better,

433
00:17:54,663 --> 00:17:56,498
so do my other selves.

434
00:17:56,532 --> 00:17:58,867
So, if someone comes
through that bathroom door

435
00:17:58,902 --> 00:18:01,438
and decides they wanna stay,
they know I need to go.

436
00:18:03,472 --> 00:18:05,942
Give us a whole new
meaning to self-loathing.

437
00:18:05,976 --> 00:18:07,210
I mean, every single day

438
00:18:07,243 --> 00:18:08,945
I'm confronted by
my worst tendencies.

439
00:18:08,979 --> 00:18:10,947
- Yeah, you and me both.

440
00:18:10,981 --> 00:18:11,880
- No, no.

441
00:18:13,283 --> 00:18:14,850
You may think you've seen
the worst of yourself,

442
00:18:14,883 --> 00:18:17,020
but trust me, there are
recesses of your being

443
00:18:17,053 --> 00:18:18,455
that do not need confronting.

444
00:18:18,487 --> 00:18:20,256
- I'm looking for a billion
dollar lottery ticket

445
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,757
and only having to
kill yourself over,

446
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,059
it doesn't sound
that Colonel Ken,

447
00:18:23,093 --> 00:18:24,961
I've considered killing
myself over much less.

448
00:18:24,995 --> 00:18:26,729
- The pronouns may be the same,

449
00:18:26,762 --> 00:18:28,898
but it's a little
different than suicide.

450
00:18:28,932 --> 00:18:30,499
- Have you done it?

451
00:18:30,532 --> 00:18:34,536
- Like I said,
I'm not from here,

452
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:38,841
but I'm here now and
no other Kens are.

453
00:18:38,874 --> 00:18:42,379
- So, that's what the first
known traversable wormhole

454
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,414
discovered in space
time is used for?

455
00:18:44,447 --> 00:18:46,016
A bunch of Kens
killing each other

456
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:47,951
to write the major
wrongs of their lives?

457
00:18:47,984 --> 00:18:49,019
- Not necessarily.

458
00:18:49,052 --> 00:18:50,186
- Oh.

459
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,454
- We've killed each other

460
00:18:51,488 --> 00:18:53,323
over our fair share of
minor wrongs as well.

461
00:18:54,823 --> 00:18:56,192
Actually, just the other day

462
00:18:56,226 --> 00:18:57,659
I had to shoot
another me in the face

463
00:18:57,693 --> 00:18:59,728
because he ran out of
milk in his universe

464
00:18:59,762 --> 00:19:00,964
and went looking for one

465
00:19:00,997 --> 00:19:03,166
where he remembered to
go grocery shopping.

466
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:04,467
How was that for colonel?

467
00:19:05,534 --> 00:19:07,603
- Yeah, that's pretty bad.

468
00:19:08,804 --> 00:19:10,606
But also just sort
of impractical.

469
00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:11,840
- Well, that's the thing

470
00:19:11,874 --> 00:19:13,943
about being connected
to infinite worlds.

471
00:19:13,977 --> 00:19:16,279
A logic and reason get thrown
out the window pretty quick

472
00:19:16,312 --> 00:19:19,315
especially when you know all
possible outcomes are realized.

473
00:19:20,816 --> 00:19:22,785
Think about your problem.

474
00:19:22,818 --> 00:19:26,122
When I gave you this
solution, did you consider it?

475
00:19:27,957 --> 00:19:30,360
- If this was real, maybe.

476
00:19:30,393 --> 00:19:32,495
- Well that's enough, right?

477
00:19:32,529 --> 00:19:34,964
All possible outcomes exist.

478
00:19:34,998 --> 00:19:36,466
So, if you've thought about it,

479
00:19:36,499 --> 00:19:38,567
you've already set
it in the motion,

480
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,569
there now exists an
infinite amount of universes

481
00:19:40,602 --> 00:19:42,038
where you've decided to do it,

482
00:19:42,072 --> 00:19:43,705
and an infinite
amount of universes

483
00:19:43,739 --> 00:19:45,141
where you've decided not to.

484
00:19:47,676 --> 00:19:50,646
You know, there is
something kind of fair

485
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:51,814
about the many worlds.

486
00:19:52,982 --> 00:19:54,250
See, if I consider
doing something,

487
00:19:54,284 --> 00:19:56,718
it doesn't really matter
if I do or do not,

488
00:19:56,752 --> 00:19:58,955
both outcomes are realized.

489
00:19:58,988 --> 00:20:02,624
In our singular world,

490
00:20:02,658 --> 00:20:04,994
we're judged based
on what we do.

491
00:20:05,028 --> 00:20:08,098
We can have evil thoughts
and terrible impulses,

492
00:20:08,131 --> 00:20:10,233
but we're judged
based on how we act.

493
00:20:11,633 --> 00:20:15,604
In the multiverse, we're
judged on our thoughts,

494
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,575
on our contemplations,

495
00:20:19,842 --> 00:20:21,610
the things that
used to be private

496
00:20:21,643 --> 00:20:23,712
now confront us at
our bathroom doors.

497
00:20:25,614 --> 00:20:28,551
In a way, it's kind of
an odd form of justice.

498
00:20:30,186 --> 00:20:34,090
We're finally being
held accountable for
who we really are.

499
00:20:34,124 --> 00:20:36,326
And the person holding
us accountable is,

500
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:39,262
well, also who we really are.

501
00:20:41,231 --> 00:20:42,265
Funny how that works.

502
00:20:45,034 --> 00:20:46,835
Well, not ha ha funny.

503
00:20:48,071 --> 00:20:50,739
- So you think if I go
looking for a universe

504
00:20:50,772 --> 00:20:52,008
where I didn't cheat

505
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,576
and end up getting
shot in the face

506
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,513
by someone else doing
the same, that's justice.

507
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:00,316
- Yeah, yeah.

508
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:05,654
I mean, you wanna know what
kind of person you really are?

509
00:21:06,456 --> 00:21:09,025
Stand by the bathroom door

510
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:10,293
and watch what comes out.

511
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:16,633
There's another one of
these in the closet.

512
00:21:19,936 --> 00:21:21,237
- But where are you going?

513
00:21:22,838 --> 00:21:26,376
- Like I said, I'm looking
for something better,

514
00:21:26,409 --> 00:21:28,077
this isn't it.

515
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:30,213
Hell, who knows?

516
00:21:30,246 --> 00:21:31,247
Maybe I'll find a universe

517
00:21:31,281 --> 00:21:33,283
where you think the
diamond thing is charming.

518
00:21:33,316 --> 00:21:36,085
- Friendly advice, I'd
settle for the billion dollars.

519
00:21:49,499 --> 00:21:53,136
- Wait, aren't you gonna
put pants on first?

520
00:21:55,071 --> 00:21:59,642
- Pants, where I'm going,
I don't need pants.

521
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:04,514
- What?

522
00:22:04,547 --> 00:22:05,781
- Nah, I'm just kidding.

523
00:22:05,814 --> 00:22:07,716
I'll just take a pair of
pants after I kill him.

524
00:22:07,749 --> 00:22:10,119
- So this is, you're really
gonna walk into that bathroom

525
00:22:10,153 --> 00:22:12,455
and expect to come out
in a different universe?

526
00:22:12,488 --> 00:22:13,889
- Yeah.

527
00:22:13,923 --> 00:22:16,092
- Well I'll be here
when you get out.

528
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,694
- Yeah, in a way you
probably will be.

529
00:22:17,726 --> 00:22:19,896
- No, me, me, not
a different me.

530
00:22:19,929 --> 00:22:21,164
- Okay.

531
00:22:21,197 --> 00:22:22,899
- So this isn't a joke,
you really believe this,

532
00:22:22,932 --> 00:22:24,634
you are really telling
me that your bathroom

533
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:26,835
is a traversable
inter-universal wormhole.

534
00:22:28,037 --> 00:22:31,274
- No Sydney, you told me.

535
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:59,269
- Ken, did it work?

536
00:23:03,906 --> 00:23:06,576
Oh my God, why
would you do that?

537
00:23:06,609 --> 00:23:08,011
Did you think that was cool?

538
00:23:08,044 --> 00:23:09,412
Was that supposed to be funny?

539
00:23:09,445 --> 00:23:10,846
What the fuck dude,

540
00:23:10,879 --> 00:23:12,382
you're a fucking freak that.

541
00:23:12,415 --> 00:23:13,616
- Sorry about that babe.

542
00:23:14,517 --> 00:23:16,085
- Where'd you get that rob?

543
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:17,387
- Your mom got it for me.

544
00:23:19,489 --> 00:23:21,357
- Is that supposed to be a joke?

545
00:23:21,391 --> 00:23:23,660
- No, she got it for
me last Christmas.

546
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:28,164
You eat yet?

547
00:23:31,867 --> 00:23:36,205
- You're actually a
pretty good actor.

548
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:37,407
- I don't get it.

549
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,409
- Do you do this
to a lot of people?

550
00:23:39,442 --> 00:23:40,310
- Do what?

551
00:23:41,311 --> 00:23:42,478
- You know, I don't like it

552
00:23:42,512 --> 00:23:43,680
when strangers use
my bathroom either,

553
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,748
but there are easier
ways to keep people out.

554
00:23:45,782 --> 00:23:47,617
- What are you talking about?

555
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:51,054
- Okay, Daniel Day,
so you don't break.

556
00:23:51,087 --> 00:23:53,222
This is impressive, but
it's also very creepy

557
00:23:53,256 --> 00:23:54,724
and any humor that I
may have found in it

558
00:23:54,757 --> 00:23:57,293
went out the window when
you showed me the gun.

559
00:23:57,327 --> 00:23:58,695
- Babe, you're freaking me out.

560
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:02,831
- Babe, so this is a universe
where we're what? Dating?

561
00:24:02,864 --> 00:24:04,033
- It's a weird way of saying it,

562
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,936
but I guess technically
true, did you?

563
00:24:06,969 --> 00:24:09,005
Did something happen while
I was in the bathroom?

564
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:12,675
- Don't do that,
don't, I'm leaving.

565
00:24:12,709 --> 00:24:14,177
- Wait, wait, wait, stop.

566
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:15,877
- I swear to God, can I
know where the other gun is?

567
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,780
- Okay, you're actually
scaring me now.

568
00:24:17,814 --> 00:24:19,682
Can you just have a seat
and let's talk a minute?

569
00:24:19,716 --> 00:24:20,950
- Please get outta my way, Ken.

570
00:24:20,983 --> 00:24:22,285
- What happened while
I was in the bathroom?

571
00:24:22,318 --> 00:24:23,986
- Nothing, you were in
there for five seconds.

572
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,922
- Well, a lot can
happen in five seconds.

573
00:24:25,955 --> 00:24:27,856
- Only when it comes
to your sex life.

574
00:24:31,327 --> 00:24:32,795
- I don't get it.
- Oh my God, do not pretend

575
00:24:32,829 --> 00:24:33,996
you don't understand
that reference.

576
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,231
- Reference to what?

577
00:24:35,264 --> 00:24:36,899
- Premature ejaculation,
premature ejaculation.

578
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,301
You're a crazy person.

579
00:24:38,334 --> 00:24:40,770
- Well you're the one
yelling premature in my face.

580
00:24:40,803 --> 00:24:42,605
- I swear to God,
Ken get outta my way.

581
00:24:48,811 --> 00:24:50,813
- Sometimes I wish I
knew what was going on

582
00:24:50,847 --> 00:24:51,948
in that head of yours.

583
00:24:53,149 --> 00:24:56,319
- You wish you knew what
was going on in my head?

584
00:24:56,352 --> 00:24:57,520
I've known you for 10 hours

585
00:24:57,553 --> 00:24:59,021
and I can't get to really know

586
00:24:59,055 --> 00:25:01,891
whether you're full of shit
or just believe your own shit.

587
00:25:01,924 --> 00:25:03,292
- 10 Hours?

588
00:25:03,326 --> 00:25:05,328
- Oh, I get it, we've
known each other for what?

589
00:25:05,361 --> 00:25:08,464
Two years or whatever the
story is in this universe?

590
00:25:08,498 --> 00:25:12,135
- Three years, we've known
each other for three years,

591
00:25:12,168 --> 00:25:13,369
and I think you should sit down.

592
00:25:13,403 --> 00:25:15,071
- I should sit down, why?

593
00:25:15,104 --> 00:25:17,707
- Because I'm worried you
hit your head or something

594
00:25:19,108 --> 00:25:20,510
because you're scaring me.

595
00:25:20,543 --> 00:25:23,146
- This is gaslighting,
you are gaslighting,

596
00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:24,747
this is psychological abuse.

597
00:25:24,781 --> 00:25:26,282
- I'm not trying to.

598
00:25:26,315 --> 00:25:27,683
- You're telling me you're
from a different universe.

599
00:25:27,717 --> 00:25:28,618
- I've never said that.

600
00:25:28,651 --> 00:25:29,752
- You're implying
it, and actually,

601
00:25:29,786 --> 00:25:31,454
yes, you did tell me you were
from a different universe

602
00:25:31,487 --> 00:25:33,055
before you went
into the bathroom.

603
00:25:34,624 --> 00:25:36,692
- We didn't talk before
I went into the bathroom,

604
00:25:36,726 --> 00:25:37,727
you weren't even up yet.

605
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,961
- I wasn't up yet.

606
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,596
You are standing in
front of me lying

607
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,798
and disguising it is proof

608
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,399
of the mini world's
interpretation.

609
00:25:43,433 --> 00:25:46,369
- Sydney, ask
yourself something,

610
00:25:47,537 --> 00:25:49,005
am I that good of a liar?

611
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:50,807
- Everybody's that
good of a liar.

612
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,641
- What?

613
00:25:51,674 --> 00:25:52,708
- Psychological
studies have shown

614
00:25:52,742 --> 00:25:54,110
that human lie
detector techniques

615
00:25:54,143 --> 00:25:57,013
and inadvertent "tales
of pseudoscience"

616
00:25:57,046 --> 00:25:59,449
no human being whether an
expert in detection or otherwise

617
00:25:59,482 --> 00:26:00,850
can tell whether
another human is lying

618
00:26:00,883 --> 00:26:02,051
with any greater certainty

619
00:26:02,084 --> 00:26:03,319
than guessing the
outcome of a coin toss

620
00:26:03,352 --> 00:26:05,021
so that can lead due to
one of two conclusions.

621
00:26:05,054 --> 00:26:07,824
Number one, no human is an
expert at detecting lies,

622
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:10,593
number two, all humans
are experts at lying.

623
00:26:12,395 --> 00:26:13,830
14% of the world is illiterate

624
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:15,398
and 100% are expert liars,

625
00:26:15,431 --> 00:26:17,467
we learn how to lie before
we learn how to read.

626
00:26:18,801 --> 00:26:20,603
- Why is that?

627
00:26:20,636 --> 00:26:22,104
- I don't know.

628
00:26:22,138 --> 00:26:24,974
Probably the same reason we
don't have fucking gills.

629
00:26:25,007 --> 00:26:26,809
- And why don't we
have fucking gills?

630
00:26:26,843 --> 00:26:28,845
- 'Cause we don't
live under water, Ken.

631
00:26:32,014 --> 00:26:33,182
- I still don't get it.

632
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,188
You push your hair
back when you lie.

633
00:26:44,093 --> 00:26:45,294
- How do you know that?

634
00:26:45,328 --> 00:26:46,863
- Because tells may
be pseudoscience,

635
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:50,199
but genuine human interaction
and connection isn't.

636
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,301
When you lie to me,
which isn't frequent

637
00:26:52,335 --> 00:26:54,737
and almost always
the white variety,

638
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:57,640
you push your hair
back, that's your tell.

639
00:27:01,277 --> 00:27:04,447
- This is so fucked up
and now I can't even like.

640
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:10,319
I think that's the
most fucked up part,

641
00:27:10,353 --> 00:27:12,088
the part of me that believes,

642
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:14,724
wants to believe that your
bathroom is a wormhole.

643
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:19,762
- Yeah, that is fucked up.

644
00:27:19,795 --> 00:27:21,932
Why do you think our
bathroom is a wormhole?

645
00:27:21,965 --> 00:27:23,432
- 'Cause you told me it was.

646
00:27:23,466 --> 00:27:27,905
- Sydney, listen, I love you.

647
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:28,838
- Don't be gross.

648
00:27:30,673 --> 00:27:35,678
- Okay.

649
00:27:39,649 --> 00:27:42,920
Obviously you are in a
sensitive place right now,

650
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,421
I can respect that,

651
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:48,658
I'm just gonna sit down, okay?

652
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:05,943
Why don't you try telling me
what happened this morning?

653
00:28:06,742 --> 00:28:10,914
- Okay, but only in the off
chance that any of it was true.

654
00:28:10,948 --> 00:28:13,683
- That makes no
sense to me but okay.

655
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:19,855
- You told me that your bathroom
was a traversable wormhole,

656
00:28:19,889 --> 00:28:22,258
that it was a link between
infinite universes,

657
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:24,962
you go in here and you
come out somewhere else.

658
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:27,530
- Well, I went in and came
back out in my apartment.

659
00:28:27,563 --> 00:28:28,731
- Right, but is
it your apartment

660
00:28:28,764 --> 00:28:30,299
or is it your apartment
in another universe?

661
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,500
And then how could we?

662
00:28:31,534 --> 00:28:34,037
Oh my God, why am I
convincing you of this?

663
00:28:34,071 --> 00:28:37,007
- Well, let's test it, right?

664
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,976
That's what they do in science.

665
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,911
I'll go back into
the bathroom and see

666
00:28:43,914 --> 00:28:46,382
if I end up in a universe
where you remember me

667
00:28:46,415 --> 00:28:47,216
and our life together.

668
00:28:47,249 --> 00:28:48,085
- You can't.

669
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:49,852
- Why not?

670
00:28:49,885 --> 00:28:51,088
- Because it's not just a link

671
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,254
between two points
and space time,

672
00:28:52,288 --> 00:28:53,723
it's a link between
an infinite amount

673
00:28:53,756 --> 00:28:55,458
of disparate points
in space time.

674
00:28:58,561 --> 00:28:59,662
- Which means?

675
00:28:59,695 --> 00:29:00,998
- Your chances of getting
back to where you started

676
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:02,231
are roughly one in infinity.

677
00:29:11,273 --> 00:29:12,475
- Are you fucking with me?

678
00:29:12,508 --> 00:29:13,843
- Hey, it's my life.

679
00:29:13,876 --> 00:29:15,645
- No, this isn't funny.

680
00:29:15,678 --> 00:29:17,179
If this is true,

681
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:19,615
if this is true that
I'm never gonna see Sid,

682
00:29:19,649 --> 00:29:20,816
my Sid again,

683
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,652
I'm never gonna get
back to where I'm from,

684
00:29:22,685 --> 00:29:24,921
I'm gonna be stuck
here with you.

685
00:29:24,955 --> 00:29:26,155
- No offense taken.

686
00:29:26,188 --> 00:29:28,157
- You who hates me,
you who is crazy.

687
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,191
- Are you okay?

688
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,693
- I'm having a panic attack.

689
00:29:30,726 --> 00:29:32,129
- Oh.

690
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:33,629
- I need you to help
me through it, okay?

691
00:29:33,663 --> 00:29:34,998
You help me through them,

692
00:29:35,032 --> 00:29:36,298
you need to help me through it.

693
00:29:36,332 --> 00:29:39,002
- Okay, what do I
normally tell you to do?

694
00:29:39,036 --> 00:29:41,370
- Name things in the room.

695
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:46,143
- Okay, I guess I'll
name the table, Pete?

696
00:29:46,175 --> 00:29:47,978
- Don't fucking tell
me to name things.

697
00:29:48,011 --> 00:29:50,312
- Okay, fine, what do
you wanna call a table?.

698
00:29:50,346 --> 00:29:52,049
- Don't give them
a fucking name.

699
00:29:53,382 --> 00:29:57,620
Okay, okay, okay,
white wall, lamp,

700
00:29:58,955 --> 00:30:01,557
painting, giant table.

701
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:10,266
Okay, remote, carpet, door knob.

702
00:30:14,704 --> 00:30:17,239
I'm sorry for yelling.

703
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,507
- It's okay.

704
00:30:38,195 --> 00:30:40,197
So you really don't
remember this morning?

705
00:31:01,918 --> 00:31:03,153
So, what now.

706
00:31:04,754 --> 00:31:09,226
- I don't know, I don't
know anything about this.

707
00:31:09,258 --> 00:31:11,327
I mean, why am I here?

708
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,263
Are my friends the
same, my parents?

709
00:31:14,296 --> 00:31:16,398
I mean, clearly my
girlfriend hates me.

710
00:31:16,432 --> 00:31:17,767
- Well, not entirely true.

711
00:31:20,036 --> 00:31:22,038
I'm technically, I'm
not your girlfriend.

712
00:31:27,944 --> 00:31:32,149
And I guess if this is
real, I don't hate you.

713
00:31:37,386 --> 00:31:38,221
- Really?

714
00:31:39,156 --> 00:31:41,524
- Yeah, that would be unfair.

715
00:31:41,557 --> 00:31:43,526
I hate the version
of you I met here,

716
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:44,560
I hope you don't
find this insulting,

717
00:31:44,593 --> 00:31:46,029
but you're kind of a douche.

718
00:31:51,134 --> 00:31:53,502
I'd hate for you to judge
me on my other self, so.

719
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,075
- Oh my God.

720
00:31:59,109 --> 00:32:00,609
- What?

721
00:32:00,643 --> 00:32:02,611
- My Sydney, she doesn't know.

722
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:05,215
She could be out in the
universe somewhere too

723
00:32:05,248 --> 00:32:07,017
or another Ken
could have shown up.

724
00:32:09,085 --> 00:32:13,689
My girlfriend could be
cheating on me, with myself?

725
00:32:14,857 --> 00:32:17,127
- Well, not technically
cheating then, is it?

726
00:32:18,794 --> 00:32:20,796
I'm just saying this is
all pretty new stuff here

727
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,698
but what really separates
us from other selves.

728
00:32:22,731 --> 00:32:25,202
- Other than being
objectively different people.

729
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,736
- Subjectively, based on
your personal feelings

730
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,039
about what a person is.

731
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,107
- We don't share a
consciousness, we're different.

732
00:32:31,141 --> 00:32:33,809
- Okay, well, consciousness
is a lousy indicator,

733
00:32:33,843 --> 00:32:35,711
it can only survive
in the present moment,

734
00:32:35,744 --> 00:32:38,114
you're only aware of your
current surroundings.

735
00:32:38,148 --> 00:32:39,849
Theoretically, you and
yourself three years ago,

736
00:32:39,882 --> 00:32:41,218
don't share a common
consciousness.

737
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:43,320
By your definition, are
you different people?

738
00:32:43,352 --> 00:32:45,554
Did your girlfriend cheat
on you with your past self

739
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,324
or is she currently cheating
on your past self with you?

740
00:32:47,356 --> 00:32:50,026
Or are they two entirely
different relationships?

741
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,095
Is this Sydney you
know even still exist?

742
00:32:53,696 --> 00:32:56,299
- Is this supposed to
make me feel better?

743
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:58,335
- No, I have no interest
in cheering you up,

744
00:32:58,367 --> 00:33:00,303
I'm just saying there's
really no difference

745
00:33:00,337 --> 00:33:01,871
between space and time.

746
00:33:01,905 --> 00:33:03,240
A different you in
a different space

747
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:04,573
and a different you
in a different time

748
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:07,376
are both quantitatively
the same you, I guess

749
00:33:07,409 --> 00:33:08,711
share the same difference.

750
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:12,448
I suppose if this
newfound discovery

751
00:33:12,481 --> 00:33:14,383
of a traversable
Einstein Rosen bridge

752
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:17,120
in your bathroom can teach
us anything, it's this

753
00:33:17,153 --> 00:33:20,323
or even more meaningless
than we originally thought,

754
00:33:20,357 --> 00:33:21,624
our choices mean nothing

755
00:33:21,657 --> 00:33:23,260
because they aren't
even choices.

756
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:24,693
We have no individuality

757
00:33:24,727 --> 00:33:27,630
because there are infinite
versions of us exactly like us,

758
00:33:27,663 --> 00:33:29,465
and we have no
self-determination

759
00:33:29,498 --> 00:33:32,501
because they're infinite
versions of us nothing like us.

760
00:33:32,534 --> 00:33:35,671
With infinite worlds comes
infinite implications.

761
00:33:35,704 --> 00:33:37,673
It would be impossible
to even begin

762
00:33:37,706 --> 00:33:40,743
to wrap one's mind around
what any of this means.

763
00:33:40,776 --> 00:33:42,845
How many choices did I make
in the past 30 seconds?

764
00:33:42,878 --> 00:33:45,248
How many times did I choose
one word over another?

765
00:33:45,282 --> 00:33:46,749
How many universes
did that create?

766
00:33:46,782 --> 00:33:48,184
How many versions
of this conversation

767
00:33:48,218 --> 00:33:49,585
are currently happening?

768
00:33:56,825 --> 00:33:59,095
Many Kens comes many problems.

769
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:14,945
- Many Kens come
get it like jizz?

770
00:34:22,718 --> 00:34:28,291
Any who, you guys
got any milk here?

771
00:35:21,844 --> 00:35:23,545
- Is he gonna kill me?

772
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:25,982
- I don't know, but this is
real.

773
00:35:31,653 --> 00:35:32,855
- What are you doing?

774
00:35:32,888 --> 00:35:34,958
- I wanna go talk to him.

775
00:35:36,126 --> 00:35:38,694
There's another
gun in the closet.

776
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:44,767
- Ah, ah, ah, ah,
ah, don't move, Ken.

777
00:35:55,677 --> 00:35:56,545
- Hi Ken.

778
00:35:57,313 --> 00:35:58,948
- What's up?

779
00:35:58,982 --> 00:36:00,016
My name is Sydney.

780
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,051
- I know.

781
00:36:01,084 --> 00:36:02,551
- Oh.

782
00:36:02,584 --> 00:36:05,255
- Yeah, we've met before,
if you know what I mean.

783
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,689
- Well, I knew what you meant
before you asked if I knew.

784
00:36:07,723 --> 00:36:08,624
- I banged you.

785
00:36:08,657 --> 00:36:10,393
- Right, great.

786
00:36:10,427 --> 00:36:11,928
- Did he bang you?

787
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,595
- No, no, he didn't.

788
00:36:15,697 --> 00:36:20,170
You leave your own
universe for free milk?

789
00:36:20,203 --> 00:36:21,071
- No.

790
00:36:21,104 --> 00:36:22,372
- No?

791
00:36:22,405 --> 00:36:25,341
So you came for something else?

792
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:27,576
- I came here for free milk.

793
00:36:27,609 --> 00:36:29,913
I left where I'm
from a while ago,

794
00:36:29,946 --> 00:36:31,981
now I just sort of hop around.

795
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,485
- Looking for anything specific?

796
00:36:36,752 --> 00:36:38,054
- You ever seen,
"Groundhogs Day."

797
00:36:38,088 --> 00:36:39,556
- A movie?

798
00:36:39,588 --> 00:36:40,689
- Well, that's what
my life is like.

799
00:36:40,722 --> 00:36:41,925
- You're stuck in a time loop?

800
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:44,227
- No, not stuck.

801
00:36:45,061 --> 00:36:46,862
Every day I wake up,

802
00:36:46,896 --> 00:36:48,064
hop into the bathroom

803
00:36:48,098 --> 00:36:50,066
and do whatever I want
wherever I end up.

804
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,134
When it's all over,

805
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:54,003
I hop back in the bathroom
and go somewhere else.

806
00:36:55,271 --> 00:36:57,140
- When you say
whatever you want.

807
00:36:58,475 --> 00:37:00,076
- Whatever I want.

808
00:37:04,047 --> 00:37:06,349
You might not understand,

809
00:37:06,382 --> 00:37:07,883
but this guy does.

810
00:37:10,487 --> 00:37:13,822
- What do you want to do here?

811
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,058
- I haven't decided yet.

812
00:37:16,226 --> 00:37:18,495
- I'm assuming you never
wanna do nice things.

813
00:37:22,332 --> 00:37:23,433
- I gave up on the concept

814
00:37:23,466 --> 00:37:25,667
of right and wrong a while ago.

815
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:29,539
Every possible outcome
is realized, right?

816
00:37:29,572 --> 00:37:30,839
- Right.

817
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:33,409
- So, when I think,

818
00:37:34,611 --> 00:37:36,412
should I blow up the
admissions building

819
00:37:36,446 --> 00:37:39,815
with everyone inside
just to see how it feels?

820
00:37:41,284 --> 00:37:42,952
Well, someone has
to do it, right?

821
00:37:42,986 --> 00:37:45,421
- Theoretically yes, but
it doesn't have to be you.

822
00:37:45,455 --> 00:37:50,059
- Oh, I know, but it's
a lot more fun if it is.

823
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:56,499
Besides, it's not like I'm
actually hurting anyone.

824
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,436
- Blowing people up
is not hurting them?

825
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:02,505
- No one's talking to you fatty.

826
00:38:05,475 --> 00:38:06,643
- Fat?

827
00:38:06,675 --> 00:38:10,046
- It's just I hate
seeing myself.

828
00:38:13,216 --> 00:38:15,218
Insecurities come off as insults

829
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:19,055
attempts to be self deprecating
or just deprecating.

830
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,025
- Yeah, well we don't
look that similar,

831
00:38:22,058 --> 00:38:23,326
your face is backwards.

832
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:24,494
- So is yours dumbass.

833
00:38:26,162 --> 00:38:28,398
- Well, you've only ever seen
yourself in a mirror before,

834
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,534
technically, this is what
your face actually looks like.

835
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,438
- Oh man.

836
00:38:35,471 --> 00:38:36,705
- Excuse me.

837
00:38:39,209 --> 00:38:43,012
- Okay, I see what
you mean, sorry.

838
00:38:44,147 --> 00:38:45,949
- So, when you say they
don't feel anything.

839
00:38:45,982 --> 00:38:48,084
- You know what I mean.

840
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,219
- Quantum suicide?

841
00:38:49,252 --> 00:38:50,752
- What's that?

842
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:54,023
- Another implication of the
mini world's interpretation.

843
00:38:54,057 --> 00:38:55,558
All possible outcomes
are realized.

844
00:38:55,592 --> 00:39:00,597
So technically, we're
all officially immortal.

845
00:39:01,598 --> 00:39:03,032
- What?

846
00:39:03,066 --> 00:39:04,334
- Well, as long as the
cause of death is quantum

847
00:39:04,367 --> 00:39:05,867
like only as long as.

848
00:39:05,902 --> 00:39:07,637
- I rig the bomb to explode

849
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:11,107
based on a 50-50
random occurrence?

850
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,542
- Something like that, yeah.

851
00:39:14,344 --> 00:39:15,877
If all possible
outcomes are realized,

852
00:39:15,912 --> 00:39:18,281
the bomb both
explodes and doesn't.

853
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:21,417
- So, what about the
universe where it does?

854
00:39:21,451 --> 00:39:23,052
- Well, they all die.

855
00:39:23,086 --> 00:39:24,954
You talked about how
consciousness makes a man.

856
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:27,123
Well, your consciousness
is automatically gonna go

857
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,358
to the universe where you live

858
00:39:28,391 --> 00:39:31,494
because there's
nowhere else to go.

859
00:39:31,527 --> 00:39:34,364
It's kind of like being a
cat in Schrodinger's cat

860
00:39:34,397 --> 00:39:37,133
from his perspective, he
never eats the poison.

861
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,601
- Why not?

862
00:39:38,635 --> 00:39:41,671
- Because if he did, he
wouldn't have a perspective.

863
00:39:41,704 --> 00:39:43,172
- Right.

864
00:39:43,206 --> 00:39:44,707
- Very psychological of you.

865
00:39:44,741 --> 00:39:45,575
- I'm a minor.

866
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:51,914
- Oh, gross, is that
why he didn't bang you?

867
00:39:51,948 --> 00:39:54,050
- A psych minor,
Jesus Christ dude.

868
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:56,352
And that's not psychology,
that's theoretical physics,

869
00:39:56,386 --> 00:39:59,222
which I guess is no
longer theoretical.

870
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,292
- Are you gonna kill me?

871
00:40:03,493 --> 00:40:05,361
- Well, we'll see.

872
00:40:06,929 --> 00:40:09,632
I can guarantee in at
least one universe I won't.

873
00:40:10,933 --> 00:40:12,201
- Right and wrong.

874
00:40:12,235 --> 00:40:14,304
- Doesn't so much
apply anymore, does it?

875
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,309
- Ken, get this,

876
00:40:19,342 --> 00:40:21,344
I found an us who
wears a fake mustache.

877
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:25,881
- Over.

878
00:40:25,915 --> 00:40:28,084
- Well, over
his upper lip,

879
00:40:28,117 --> 00:40:30,153
where else would you
wear a fake mustache?

880
00:40:30,186 --> 00:40:33,790
- No Ken, when you're done
talking you say over, over.

881
00:40:33,822 --> 00:40:37,093
- You say
over or over, over?

882
00:40:37,126 --> 00:40:40,196
Over, over?

883
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:43,099
- No, you just say over, over

884
00:40:43,132 --> 00:40:44,901
but not over, over.

885
00:40:44,934 --> 00:40:46,202
I'm saying over and then.

886
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,236
- Who is that?

887
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,071
- Who's that?

888
00:40:48,104 --> 00:40:49,305
- Another Ken.

889
00:40:49,339 --> 00:40:50,807
- Doesn't sound
like another Ken.

890
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:53,609
- No, Ken, it's another
Sydney, you're another Ken.

891
00:40:53,643 --> 00:40:56,446
- Well, from my
perspective, you're another Ken,

892
00:40:56,479 --> 00:40:57,680
I'm just Ken.

893
00:40:57,714 --> 00:40:59,949
- Okay, but I'm speaking
from my perspective,

894
00:40:59,982 --> 00:41:02,952
you know the way every
human being talks? Over.

895
00:41:04,387 --> 00:41:05,588
- Talks over what?

896
00:41:08,191 --> 00:41:12,695
Oh nevermind, I get it, over.

897
00:41:12,729 --> 00:41:14,597
- How are you speaking with him?

898
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:15,765
- Walkie-talkie.

899
00:41:15,798 --> 00:41:18,801
- Obviously, I
meant, where is he?

900
00:41:18,835 --> 00:41:19,868
- Another universe.

901
00:41:19,902 --> 00:41:21,804
- You can do that?

902
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:24,440
- Yeah, I met him and
gave him a walkie-talkie,

903
00:41:24,474 --> 00:41:26,376
we stay in contact, tell
each other what we see.

904
00:41:26,409 --> 00:41:30,713
- By the way, not a
fake mustache, it's real.

905
00:41:30,747 --> 00:41:32,682
Dunno why I thought
it was fake, over.

906
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:35,418
- I see you two are
doing important work.

907
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:36,986
- We're just trying to
make a bit more sense

908
00:41:37,019 --> 00:41:38,521
outta this senseless universe.

909
00:41:38,554 --> 00:41:40,823
- A senseless universe
that has great signal.

910
00:41:40,857 --> 00:41:42,258
- Well why wouldn't it?

911
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,193
Technically there's no
real distance between them,

912
00:41:44,227 --> 00:41:46,496
it's not as though they
actually exist in space time,

913
00:41:46,529 --> 00:41:47,597
they're all here.

914
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,931
- I guess that makes sense,

915
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:52,201
but only because it
doesn't make sense.

916
00:41:52,235 --> 00:41:53,269
- Crazy world.

917
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,771
- Worlds.

918
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:57,073
- Sorry, can we go back to
whether you're gonna kill me?

919
00:41:57,106 --> 00:41:58,007
- Who's that?

920
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,308
- Another Ken.

921
00:41:59,342 --> 00:42:00,777
- Another Ken
from my perspective

922
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,745
or another Ken from
your perspective?

923
00:42:02,779 --> 00:42:05,681
- Another Ken from both
of our perspectives.

924
00:42:05,715 --> 00:42:08,618
- Right, and
which Ken is this?

925
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,521
- Which Ken are you
or which Ken are we?

926
00:42:11,554 --> 00:42:12,922
- Which Ken are you?

927
00:42:12,955 --> 00:42:13,990
Why would I ask which Ken I am?

928
00:42:14,023 --> 00:42:15,725
- Well, I'm the original Ken.

929
00:42:15,758 --> 00:42:17,427
- No, I'm the original Ken.

930
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,928
- I was here first.

931
00:42:18,961 --> 00:42:20,563
- Technically neither of
you are the original Ken.

932
00:42:20,596 --> 00:42:23,065
But for convenience sake,

933
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:25,101
maybe you should be Ken
one and you be Ken two.

934
00:42:25,134 --> 00:42:28,104
- I don't like numbers,
sounds like a ranking.

935
00:42:28,137 --> 00:42:30,106
- It's not a ranking,
it's chronological.

936
00:42:30,139 --> 00:42:31,574
- From your perspective.

937
00:42:31,607 --> 00:42:34,644
- Yes, everyone is speaking
from their perspective.

938
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,712
- What about
letters instead?

939
00:42:36,746 --> 00:42:37,513
I'll be Ken A.

940
00:42:37,547 --> 00:42:38,448
- You would be Ken C.

941
00:42:38,481 --> 00:42:39,682
- I don't wanna be Ken C.

942
00:42:39,715 --> 00:42:42,084
- How about if he's
Kenny and I'm Kenneth?

943
00:42:42,118 --> 00:42:44,086
- Why would we skip
all the way to E and F?

944
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,221
- Not Ken E, Kenny.

945
00:42:45,254 --> 00:42:46,489
If we're doing
letters, Kenny can be.

946
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:47,757
- It can be what?

947
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:49,725
- No, she's saying
Kenny can be Ken B.

948
00:42:49,759 --> 00:42:51,260
- So I'm Ken C?

949
00:42:51,294 --> 00:42:53,029
I said I don't wanna be Ken C.

950
00:42:53,062 --> 00:42:55,431
- Why does the Ken on the
phone even need a letter?

951
00:42:55,465 --> 00:42:57,733
He can't come here, can he?

952
00:42:57,767 --> 00:42:59,903
- Sorry, are you
saying Kenny or Ken E?

953
00:42:59,937 --> 00:43:01,170
- Neither, he's Ken B.

954
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:02,505
- He can be what?

955
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,073
- No, he's Ken B.

956
00:43:04,106 --> 00:43:04,908
- Who?

957
00:43:04,942 --> 00:43:05,741
- Him.

958
00:43:05,775 --> 00:43:07,276
- He can't see.

959
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:08,878
- I'm not Ken C, you
can't just make me Ken C.

960
00:43:08,912 --> 00:43:09,779
- Yes, we can.

961
00:43:09,812 --> 00:43:10,613
- Cannot.

962
00:43:10,646 --> 00:43:11,747
- Ken two.

963
00:43:11,781 --> 00:43:12,682
- I thought we
weren't doing numbers.

964
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:15,485
- Jesus Christ, can we, can we,

965
00:43:15,518 --> 00:43:17,220
not Ken three or Kenny or Ken E,

966
00:43:17,253 --> 00:43:19,722
can we put the walkie-
talkie aside for a moment?

967
00:43:21,991 --> 00:43:25,294
- Ken, I gotta let
you go over and out.

968
00:43:25,328 --> 00:43:27,263
- Wait, what
does and out mean?

969
00:43:27,296 --> 00:43:28,564
- Okay, first of all,

970
00:43:28,598 --> 00:43:30,233
why are you in contact
with another Ken?

971
00:43:30,266 --> 00:43:31,434
- Two heads are better than one.

972
00:43:31,467 --> 00:43:32,635
- Not when it comes to Ken's,

973
00:43:32,668 --> 00:43:34,170
no head would be
better than his one.

974
00:43:34,203 --> 00:43:35,404
- That's kind of ambiguous.

975
00:43:35,438 --> 00:43:36,539
- What?

976
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,341
- Yeah, it is.

977
00:43:38,374 --> 00:43:40,743
When you say no head would
be better than his one.

978
00:43:40,776 --> 00:43:43,412
Are you saying his one
is worse than none at all

979
00:43:43,446 --> 00:43:46,182
or there's no head in the
universe is better than his?

980
00:43:46,215 --> 00:43:47,350
Like he's the smartest?

981
00:43:48,518 --> 00:43:50,019
- Are you two trying
to prove my point?

982
00:43:50,052 --> 00:43:51,521
'Cause you're actually
doing a good job.

983
00:43:51,554 --> 00:43:53,656
- That's all so ambiguous.

984
00:43:53,689 --> 00:43:55,324
- Oh my God, it is.

985
00:43:55,358 --> 00:43:56,859
Because if we're
doing a good job

986
00:43:56,894 --> 00:43:58,394
proving two Kens
are worse than one,

987
00:43:58,427 --> 00:43:59,662
then we've actually proven

988
00:43:59,695 --> 00:44:01,063
that two Kens are
better than one.

989
00:44:02,933 --> 00:44:04,133
- Are you gonna shoot him soon?

990
00:44:04,166 --> 00:44:08,005
- I don't know, he's
kind of growing on me.

991
00:44:08,037 --> 00:44:09,672
- I like self-loathing
kind better.

992
00:44:09,705 --> 00:44:11,541
- Well, I like the Sydney
who banged me better.

993
00:44:11,574 --> 00:44:13,676
Anything ambiguous about that?

994
00:44:13,709 --> 00:44:15,979
- Actually yeah.

995
00:44:16,879 --> 00:44:18,080
Do you mean you like the Sydney

996
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:19,549
that did a better
job banging you

997
00:44:19,582 --> 00:44:22,585
or you just like the Sydney
you had sex with better?

998
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:24,220
- Have you banged
multiple Sydney's?

999
00:44:24,253 --> 00:44:26,789
- I live a consequence
free existence

1000
00:44:26,822 --> 00:44:29,725
in the multiverse infinite
levels of low self-esteem.

1001
00:44:29,759 --> 00:44:31,661
So yeah, I've banged
a few Sydney's,

1002
00:44:33,195 --> 00:44:34,697
banged a few Kens also.

1003
00:44:35,731 --> 00:44:36,532
- Are you gay?

1004
00:44:36,566 --> 00:44:38,035
- Is masturbation gay?

1005
00:44:38,067 --> 00:44:40,003
- Is masturbation the same
as having sex with yourself?

1006
00:44:40,037 --> 00:44:41,871
- That's pretty
much the definition.

1007
00:44:41,905 --> 00:44:44,340
- Is it technically incest?

1008
00:44:44,373 --> 00:44:46,075
- Maybe we're asking the
wrong questions here.

1009
00:44:46,108 --> 00:44:46,944
- Yeah.

1010
00:44:48,444 --> 00:44:49,612
Who's on top?

1011
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:53,783
- No, Ken, what I
mean is, is it random?

1012
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:54,617
- Is what?

1013
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,919
- Where you go,
where you end up,

1014
00:44:55,953 --> 00:44:58,387
do you have any way of
knowing or controlling,

1015
00:44:58,421 --> 00:45:00,122
can a Ken ever go
back home again?

1016
00:45:01,457 --> 00:45:03,659
- I think you're thinking
of it incorrectly.

1017
00:45:03,693 --> 00:45:05,628
There's no real home.

1018
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:08,130
We're multiplying
at an insane rate.

1019
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:09,699
The world you left
has since morphed

1020
00:45:09,732 --> 00:45:11,634
into a million
different new worlds.

1021
00:45:12,768 --> 00:45:14,270
Which one are you
trying to get back to?

1022
00:45:14,303 --> 00:45:15,137
- Any of them.

1023
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:19,009
Just one that feels like home.

1024
00:45:19,042 --> 00:45:20,509
- Well, lucky for you.

1025
00:45:20,543 --> 00:45:22,411
There exist an infinite
amount of worlds out there

1026
00:45:22,445 --> 00:45:24,213
that will feel just like home.

1027
00:45:24,246 --> 00:45:26,148
- But I'll know it isn't real.

1028
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:27,750
- Trust me, Ken,

1029
00:45:27,783 --> 00:45:29,685
even if you made it back
to where you started,

1030
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:31,922
it would still
feel just as fake.

1031
00:45:31,955 --> 00:45:34,323
There's no going back
to how you used to live.

1032
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:35,491
- According to you.

1033
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:37,326
- Who is also you.

1034
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,729
- Why should you get to use
the multiverse like this?

1035
00:45:39,762 --> 00:45:40,897
Why are you allowed to treat it

1036
00:45:40,931 --> 00:45:42,131
like your own
personal playground?

1037
00:45:42,164 --> 00:45:43,432
- We all can.

1038
00:45:43,466 --> 00:45:45,267
- Well, not all of us want to,

1039
00:45:45,301 --> 00:45:47,803
some of us just wanna be left
alone in our own universe.

1040
00:45:47,837 --> 00:45:50,406
- I didn't make you
go into the bathroom.

1041
00:45:50,439 --> 00:45:53,110
- I know, here you are.

1042
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,611
- So what are you gonna do?

1043
00:45:55,645 --> 00:45:57,114
- What do you mean?

1044
00:45:57,146 --> 00:45:58,314
- What's your plan?

1045
00:45:58,347 --> 00:46:00,783
What's in store for your wacky
"Groundhog Day" escapades?

1046
00:46:04,087 --> 00:46:06,689
- I'm gonna cut one of
you up into little pieces

1047
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:09,492
and make the other one eat them.

1048
00:46:15,464 --> 00:46:16,298
- Right.

1049
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,970
Well I guess you'll be
cutting up Ken then.

1050
00:46:20,003 --> 00:46:21,370
- I'm sorry, why?

1051
00:46:21,404 --> 00:46:22,872
- Has something changed?

1052
00:46:22,906 --> 00:46:24,074
Last night you
seem pretty intent

1053
00:46:24,107 --> 00:46:25,474
on not putting any part
of me in your mouth

1054
00:46:25,508 --> 00:46:27,376
and now you're prepared
to do the full mazy?

1055
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:28,912
- First of all, that wasn't me,

1056
00:46:28,945 --> 00:46:31,313
secondly, canalingus is a
long shot from cannibalism,

1057
00:46:31,347 --> 00:46:35,618
and thirdly, he's not
gonna be cutting anyone up.

1058
00:46:35,651 --> 00:46:36,585
- No, I am.

1059
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:39,855
- What, why?

1060
00:46:39,889 --> 00:46:41,124
- I don't know.

1061
00:46:43,292 --> 00:46:46,096
I guess I used to
consider myself a nihilist

1062
00:46:46,129 --> 00:46:47,496
before the bathroom days.

1063
00:46:48,932 --> 00:46:53,202
But once I really saw how
meaningless this universe is,

1064
00:46:53,235 --> 00:46:56,572
I realized how much I cared
and felt before I found out.

1065
00:46:59,341 --> 00:47:01,011
And you know what
else I realized?

1066
00:47:02,478 --> 00:47:03,312
I liked it.

1067
00:47:05,048 --> 00:47:08,517
I liked caring and feeling

1068
00:47:08,551 --> 00:47:10,120
and I became nostalgic for it.

1069
00:47:11,754 --> 00:47:16,225
Or the nihilistic
equivalent of nostalgia.

1070
00:47:16,258 --> 00:47:18,161
See, being a nihilist
is a cool thing to say,

1071
00:47:18,195 --> 00:47:20,229
but in practice it's
rather depressing.

1072
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:22,598
It's nice to feel things.

1073
00:47:23,766 --> 00:47:26,335
It's nice to believe in meaning.

1074
00:47:29,271 --> 00:47:31,674
I hope you won't judge
me too harshly for this.

1075
00:47:31,707 --> 00:47:33,809
And I mean that as empty
a platitude as possible.

1076
00:47:33,843 --> 00:47:38,848
I don't care how you
judge me, but know this,

1077
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:43,619
it's hard to make
yourself care anymore,

1078
00:47:45,021 --> 00:47:51,962
it's hard to feel happy or
hopeful or proud, I've tried.

1079
00:47:52,628 --> 00:47:57,633
So this, well, shame and
repulsion don't feel as nice,

1080
00:47:59,535 --> 00:48:03,639
but they let me know I
still know how to feel

1081
00:48:05,307 --> 00:48:06,475
and that's good enough.

1082
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:10,412
- You don't have to do this.

1083
00:48:10,446 --> 00:48:13,449
- Of course I do,
I'm a psychopath.

1084
00:48:15,384 --> 00:48:18,121
- But you don't seem
like a psychopath.

1085
00:48:18,155 --> 00:48:19,755
- Well, he did say he was
gonna cut one of us up

1086
00:48:19,789 --> 00:48:20,856
and make the other one eat them.

1087
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:23,226
- No, yeah, I'm just saying,

1088
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:25,294
outside of that he seems normal.

1089
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:29,865
Have you ever thought that
maybe you aren't a psychopath,

1090
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,968
maybe you're just depressed?

1091
00:48:32,002 --> 00:48:34,104
- Jesus, Ken, he's
a psychopath, okay,

1092
00:48:34,137 --> 00:48:35,538
why is that so hard
for you to believe?

1093
00:48:35,571 --> 00:48:38,909
- Because if he's a psychopath
and that means I am too,

1094
00:48:38,942 --> 00:48:41,610
or at least I could be.

1095
00:48:41,644 --> 00:48:44,547
- Well fuck Ken, anyone
could be a psychopath.

1096
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:46,149
I mean somewhere out
there everyone is,

1097
00:48:46,183 --> 00:48:47,483
it doesn't mean the versions
of ourselves who aren't

1098
00:48:47,516 --> 00:48:49,252
should feel responsible for it.

1099
00:48:49,286 --> 00:48:50,820
- I agree with Sydney.

1100
00:48:50,853 --> 00:48:53,290
It's not your fault I
do wacky shit like this.

1101
00:48:53,322 --> 00:48:55,658
- No, it is, at some point

1102
00:48:55,691 --> 00:48:58,128
we need to take
responsibility for ourselves,

1103
00:48:58,161 --> 00:49:00,096
for our other selves.

1104
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:01,298
All possible outcomes of realize

1105
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:03,200
is not an excuse for depravity,

1106
00:49:03,233 --> 00:49:06,036
depravity shouldn't
be a possible outcome.

1107
00:49:06,069 --> 00:49:07,237
Why do we settle for knowing

1108
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:09,805
we barely escape
being our worst self?

1109
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:12,042
- Well, it's not anyone's
fault that I am what I am,

1110
00:49:12,075 --> 00:49:14,244
I'm a product of the multiverse.

1111
00:49:14,277 --> 00:49:16,079
- That's a cop out.

1112
00:49:16,112 --> 00:49:18,248
The multiverse is
a product of us.

1113
00:49:18,281 --> 00:49:20,217
We aren't running around
shooting each other in the head

1114
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:23,153
over empty milk cartons because
the universe is meaningless,

1115
00:49:23,186 --> 00:49:24,386
the universe is meaningless

1116
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:25,989
because of how we
choose to treat it.

1117
00:49:27,991 --> 00:49:30,093
- Chicken and egg situation.

1118
00:49:30,126 --> 00:49:31,727
- Something like that.

1119
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,129
- Well, I apologize, Ken,

1120
00:49:33,163 --> 00:49:35,431
but I do not share
your sentiment.

1121
00:49:35,464 --> 00:49:38,301
I don't think we can all
stand around and sing Kumbaya.

1122
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:43,639
When did you find out
about the bathroom?

1123
00:49:43,672 --> 00:49:44,874
- Today.

1124
00:49:44,908 --> 00:49:48,345
- Right, give it time.

1125
00:49:48,377 --> 00:49:51,547
We all felt the same way
when we first found out.

1126
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,216
There must be a
better way to use it,

1127
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:55,318
there must be
something we can do.

1128
00:49:55,352 --> 00:49:57,153
- Well, did any of you try?

1129
00:49:57,187 --> 00:49:58,321
- What do you think?

1130
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:00,623
There are different
Kens out there,

1131
00:50:00,656 --> 00:50:03,692
but we're all variations
of the same person.

1132
00:50:03,726 --> 00:50:07,396
You know me the
same way I know you,

1133
00:50:08,597 --> 00:50:10,799
the same way I know
every Ken I've ever met.

1134
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,569
- You don't know me.

1135
00:50:13,602 --> 00:50:14,436
- Sure I do.

1136
00:50:15,604 --> 00:50:17,606
I can tell just
by looking at you.

1137
00:50:19,242 --> 00:50:21,177
I know what you're thinking

1138
00:50:21,211 --> 00:50:23,013
because I know what
I'd be thinking.

1139
00:50:24,747 --> 00:50:25,814
You're scared.

1140
00:50:27,984 --> 00:50:29,286
- You're gonna cut me
up in little pieces,

1141
00:50:29,319 --> 00:50:31,054
of course I'm scared,

1142
00:50:31,087 --> 00:50:32,855
it's not exactly a
stab in the dark.

1143
00:50:32,888 --> 00:50:35,225
- I meant you're always scared,

1144
00:50:35,258 --> 00:50:36,425
even when a psycho isn't about

1145
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:37,961
to feed you to your girlfriend.

1146
00:50:37,994 --> 00:50:39,095
- Oh, we're not dating.

1147
00:50:39,129 --> 00:50:40,263
- You get nervous.

1148
00:50:40,297 --> 00:50:41,898
- So, everyone gets nervous.

1149
00:50:41,932 --> 00:50:43,632
- You have anxiety Ken.

1150
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:44,833
- No, I don't.

1151
00:50:44,867 --> 00:50:46,702
- You did have a
panic attack earlier.

1152
00:50:46,735 --> 00:50:48,504
- You're a hypochondriac.

1153
00:50:48,537 --> 00:50:50,673
- I am not a
hypochondriac, I just,

1154
00:50:52,142 --> 00:50:54,277
I convince myself
that I am sometimes.

1155
00:50:54,311 --> 00:50:57,147
- Yeah, that's kind of the
definition of hypochondria.

1156
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:58,747
- What does any of this matter?

1157
00:50:58,781 --> 00:51:02,885
- I'm saying I know you
and because I know you,

1158
00:51:02,919 --> 00:51:04,486
I know how you really feel.

1159
00:51:05,621 --> 00:51:06,990
You aren't standing
on your soapbox

1160
00:51:07,023 --> 00:51:08,490
because of any moral backbone

1161
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:11,660
or wayward desire to see
the multiverse cleaned up,

1162
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:14,730
you're just scared
of what's out there.

1163
00:51:14,763 --> 00:51:16,232
And if you could go back

1164
00:51:16,266 --> 00:51:18,567
to never knowing any of
this existed, you'd do it

1165
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:22,973
because you don't wanna
help, you wanna run.

1166
00:51:25,241 --> 00:51:30,146
Give it time, that
fear always goes away.

1167
00:51:31,314 --> 00:51:34,451
But when it does,
you'll miss it.

1168
00:51:34,483 --> 00:51:35,684
- And then what?

1169
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:37,619
I'm gonna force people
to eat each other

1170
00:51:37,653 --> 00:51:39,722
to get that feeling
back, I doubt it.

1171
00:51:39,755 --> 00:51:41,523
- The ken on the other
end of that walkie-talkie,

1172
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:43,226
he was kind of
like you at first.

1173
00:51:44,693 --> 00:51:47,330
After a while he adjusted
to the meaninglessness,

1174
00:51:47,364 --> 00:51:50,934
he wasn't violent, but he
was desperate to feel again.

1175
00:51:52,102 --> 00:51:54,471
He was masturbating
17 times a day,

1176
00:51:55,704 --> 00:51:57,740
the people close to
him were worried.

1177
00:51:59,175 --> 00:52:01,244
- Worried he was gonna
get some on them?

1178
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:10,253
Get it, people close to him

1179
00:52:11,187 --> 00:52:12,489
while he was masturbating.

1180
00:52:18,428 --> 00:52:19,795
- Huh, I get it.

1181
00:52:45,922 --> 00:52:47,457
- Is he gonna be
able to cut us up?

1182
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:49,059
I thought we were immortal.

1183
00:52:49,092 --> 00:52:50,759
- Only when it comes to
qauntum causes of death.

1184
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:52,462
- And being cut in
the little pieces is.

1185
00:52:52,495 --> 00:52:53,862
- It's our mistake.

1186
00:52:53,897 --> 00:52:55,398
In order to achieve
quantum immortality,

1187
00:52:55,432 --> 00:52:56,865
we need to enter a
seat of superposition

1188
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,334
of being both alive and dead.

1189
00:53:00,569 --> 00:53:02,338
- Well, should we
just do that then

1190
00:53:02,372 --> 00:53:03,907
run away or something?

1191
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:05,442
Why are we just sitting here?

1192
00:53:05,475 --> 00:53:07,944
- He's got a gun, we need
to get out of the closet.

1193
00:53:09,678 --> 00:53:13,416
- Sydney, meet Sydney.

1194
00:53:15,717 --> 00:53:18,121
- Yeah, the backwards
facing is kind of tricky.

1195
00:53:19,721 --> 00:53:21,291
- I'm Ken.

1196
00:53:21,324 --> 00:53:23,393
- I know, I was just
telling the other Ken,

1197
00:53:23,426 --> 00:53:25,594
I loved to gas bar Guinevere.

1198
00:53:25,627 --> 00:53:26,563
- What's that?

1199
00:53:26,595 --> 00:53:27,796
- The movie we wrote.

1200
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:29,065
- We wrote a movie?

1201
00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:31,267
- Well, we conceived
of an idea for one,

1202
00:53:31,301 --> 00:53:33,802
some named Alan Davidson
got there first.

1203
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:35,038
- Not where I'm from,

1204
00:53:35,071 --> 00:53:36,039
where I'm from it's
written by a Ken.

1205
00:53:36,072 --> 00:53:38,208
- So why are you here?

1206
00:53:38,241 --> 00:53:39,209
- Sorry.

1207
00:53:39,242 --> 00:53:41,111
- What are you looking for?

1208
00:53:41,144 --> 00:53:42,045
- What are you?

1209
00:53:42,078 --> 00:53:43,513
- I'm from this universe,

1210
00:53:43,546 --> 00:53:46,216
I'm one of those Sydney's
with personal accountability.

1211
00:53:46,249 --> 00:53:48,051
- She just found out
about the bathroom today.

1212
00:53:48,084 --> 00:53:48,918
- Ah.

1213
00:53:49,885 --> 00:53:53,356
- No, no, I mean I did, sure,
I learned about it today.

1214
00:53:53,389 --> 00:53:55,691
But no, not every
Sydney and not every Ken

1215
00:53:55,724 --> 00:53:56,926
ends up like you two, okay,

1216
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,561
and I know, okay, I get it,

1217
00:53:58,595 --> 00:54:00,263
I get it makes you two
feel better about selves

1218
00:54:00,296 --> 00:54:01,898
to think that it's not
you, it's the multiverse.

1219
00:54:01,931 --> 00:54:04,267
And when you meet a couple of
squares like me and this Ken,

1220
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:05,902
you think the only reason
we don't get our rocks off

1221
00:54:05,935 --> 00:54:07,937
on force cannibalism is
because we're still too green.

1222
00:54:07,971 --> 00:54:10,706
You can rationalize your
behavior however you'd like.

1223
00:54:10,739 --> 00:54:12,342
- Like, so can you?

1224
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:13,309
- What's that supposed to mean?

1225
00:54:13,343 --> 00:54:14,776
- Wait, what about cannibalism?

1226
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:16,678
- I'm saying everyone
ends up this way,

1227
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:19,249
you're saying that's not
true, what's the difference?

1228
00:54:19,282 --> 00:54:20,749
Both are just speculation.

1229
00:54:20,782 --> 00:54:22,585
- No, one is a
reasonable conclusion

1230
00:54:22,619 --> 00:54:23,852
and the other is
an outlandish claim

1231
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:25,588
that all kinds of a
cannibalism fetish.

1232
00:54:25,622 --> 00:54:27,457
- She keeps saying
cannibalism, right?

1233
00:54:27,490 --> 00:54:28,291
Is someone gonna eat me?

1234
00:54:28,324 --> 00:54:29,691
Do you eat Sydney's?

1235
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:31,161
- Relax, he doesn't eat anything
if you know what I mean.

1236
00:54:31,194 --> 00:54:31,995
- I do not.

1237
00:54:32,028 --> 00:54:33,963
- She means sexually.

1238
00:54:33,997 --> 00:54:35,431
- Sorry, what's the
relationship here?

1239
00:54:35,465 --> 00:54:36,732
- We've been dating
for three years.

1240
00:54:36,765 --> 00:54:37,967
- I just met him last night.

1241
00:54:38,001 --> 00:54:39,701
- And he didn't bang her
because she's a minor.

1242
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:41,137
- A psych minor.

1243
00:54:41,171 --> 00:54:42,472
- He didn't bang you because
you're a psych minor?

1244
00:54:42,505 --> 00:54:44,040
- He didn't bang me, period.

1245
00:54:44,073 --> 00:54:45,807
- He didn't bang
her on her period, over.

1246
00:54:45,841 --> 00:54:47,577
- That's what it
sounds like, over.

1247
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:48,611
- How long has he
been listening?

1248
00:54:48,645 --> 00:54:49,711
- Sorry, who's that?

1249
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:50,779
- I'm the main Ken.

1250
00:54:50,812 --> 00:54:51,981
- The main Ken?

1251
00:54:52,015 --> 00:54:53,416
- Well from
my perspective.

1252
00:54:53,449 --> 00:54:54,484
- What?

1253
00:54:54,517 --> 00:54:55,985
- He talks like that.

1254
00:54:56,019 --> 00:54:58,154
- Why didn't he bang
her on her period? Over.

1255
00:54:58,188 --> 00:54:59,522
- I'm not on my period.

1256
00:54:59,556 --> 00:55:01,024
- So why didn't he bang you?

1257
00:55:01,057 --> 00:55:02,525
- He didn't bang me because he
is from a different universe

1258
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:04,260
and one who was
from this universe

1259
00:55:04,294 --> 00:55:05,495
didn't really bang me either.

1260
00:55:05,528 --> 00:55:07,130
- Because
you're a minor? Over.

1261
00:55:07,163 --> 00:55:10,133
- I am not a minor,
I am over 18, over.

1262
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,969
- Sorry, were
you done talking

1263
00:55:13,002 --> 00:55:14,571
or was that for emphasis?

1264
00:55:14,604 --> 00:55:16,673
- I was also confused.

1265
00:55:16,705 --> 00:55:18,341
- The point is it
makes no sense to say

1266
00:55:18,374 --> 00:55:20,109
we didn't get bang
because we're minors.

1267
00:55:20,143 --> 00:55:21,344
- Because we're 22?

1268
00:55:21,377 --> 00:55:22,545
- Because we don't
believe in time.

1269
00:55:22,579 --> 00:55:24,780
- You don't
believe in time? Over.

1270
00:55:24,813 --> 00:55:26,715
- Well how do you
not believe in time?

1271
00:55:27,849 --> 00:55:29,252
- It's not that simple.

1272
00:55:29,285 --> 00:55:31,588
It has to do with entropy
and our inefficient,

1273
00:55:31,621 --> 00:55:33,755
incomplete understanding
of the flow of time.

1274
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:36,693
Do I really have to
explain this again?

1275
00:55:36,725 --> 00:55:39,929
- Technically you've never
explained it to any of us.

1276
00:55:39,963 --> 00:55:42,198
Plus, the more time
you spend explaining,

1277
00:55:42,232 --> 00:55:44,934
the longer you get to wait
before you have to eat Ken.

1278
00:55:46,302 --> 00:55:48,605
- So you are saying
cannibalism, right.

1279
00:55:49,771 --> 00:55:51,708
- I'm thinking I'm gonna
make you eat him too.

1280
00:55:53,142 --> 00:55:54,544
I'm a bit of a psychopath.

1281
00:55:58,348 --> 00:55:59,182
- Right.

1282
00:56:01,883 --> 00:56:04,053
The basic idea is that
all of the equations

1283
00:56:04,087 --> 00:56:05,421
of fundamental physics

1284
00:56:05,455 --> 00:56:07,856
have nothing to distinguish
past from future,

1285
00:56:07,889 --> 00:56:09,492
they all work both ways.

1286
00:56:09,525 --> 00:56:10,660
Theoretically, time doesn't flow

1287
00:56:10,693 --> 00:56:12,195
in any particular direction,

1288
00:56:12,228 --> 00:56:15,064
the only instance in which it
does is when it comes to heat,

1289
00:56:15,098 --> 00:56:18,468
heat can never pass from a
cold body to a hot one, never.

1290
00:56:21,371 --> 00:56:25,575
I guess now all possible
outcomes are realized.

1291
00:56:25,608 --> 00:56:27,243
So theoretically there
could exist the universe

1292
00:56:27,277 --> 00:56:28,978
in which the basic
principles of thermodynamics

1293
00:56:29,012 --> 00:56:30,246
are backwards.

1294
00:56:31,948 --> 00:56:34,684
A universe in which
the patterns we observe

1295
00:56:34,717 --> 00:56:35,918
in the natural world flow

1296
00:56:35,952 --> 00:56:37,987
from a higher state of
entropy to a lower one,

1297
00:56:38,021 --> 00:56:43,026
the world here, the future
is theoretically knowable.

1298
00:56:45,361 --> 00:56:46,862
That's how you could get home.

1299
00:56:48,431 --> 00:56:49,265
- Oh my god.

1300
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:53,002
Wait, sorry, what
did you just say?

1301
00:56:53,036 --> 00:56:55,271
- If you could find a universe
where entropy was reversed,

1302
00:56:55,305 --> 00:56:56,706
you could see your own future,

1303
00:56:56,739 --> 00:56:58,207
you could see which choices
would lead you where,

1304
00:56:58,241 --> 00:57:00,076
you could theoretically
know how each decision

1305
00:57:00,109 --> 00:57:01,411
to enter or not
enter the bathroom

1306
00:57:01,444 --> 00:57:03,146
would play out 40
years down the line.

1307
00:57:03,179 --> 00:57:04,480
You could take your
one in infinity odds

1308
00:57:04,514 --> 00:57:05,748
of getting back
and narrow it down

1309
00:57:05,782 --> 00:57:07,984
by seeing how each
choice plays out.

1310
00:57:08,017 --> 00:57:10,219
- Of course, if you made it
to one of those universes

1311
00:57:10,253 --> 00:57:12,955
that'd come at a cost, you'd
be giving up your past,

1312
00:57:12,989 --> 00:57:16,259
you'd be trading in your
memories for your future.

1313
00:57:16,292 --> 00:57:19,195
- She's right, you'd forget
all about your Sydney.

1314
00:57:20,396 --> 00:57:24,133
- So, if I forgot
all about my Sydney,

1315
00:57:24,167 --> 00:57:26,269
what would make me know
to try and find her?

1316
00:57:27,203 --> 00:57:28,837
- You'd have to trust your gut.

1317
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:30,872
You'd have to trust that
what you had with her

1318
00:57:30,907 --> 00:57:32,408
is really what you
choose when confronted

1319
00:57:32,442 --> 00:57:34,610
with literally
endless alternatives.

1320
00:57:36,212 --> 00:57:37,647
Of course, there's
also the chance

1321
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,049
you wouldn't even know you're
remembering past or future

1322
00:57:40,083 --> 00:57:41,584
I guess since no human being

1323
00:57:41,617 --> 00:57:43,453
is ever really remembered
their future before

1324
00:57:43,486 --> 00:57:44,821
we don't have a reference point

1325
00:57:44,853 --> 00:57:46,255
as to if it's played
any differently

1326
00:57:46,289 --> 00:57:48,324
than our current memories.

1327
00:57:48,358 --> 00:57:50,493
- You would need some sort
of a test for every universe,

1328
00:57:50,526 --> 00:57:51,694
a heat test.

1329
00:57:51,728 --> 00:57:53,529
- Exactly, you'd need.

1330
00:57:53,563 --> 00:57:54,697
- You'd need me
to change my mind

1331
00:57:54,731 --> 00:57:56,399
and not feed you
to the Sydney's.

1332
00:57:58,935 --> 00:58:01,337
- Right, well, if we're
just gonna wax theoretical

1333
00:58:01,371 --> 00:58:03,005
a bit longer before dinner,

1334
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:05,475
what would be an
efficient test of entropy?

1335
00:58:05,508 --> 00:58:06,743
- The fog test.

1336
00:58:06,776 --> 00:58:08,077
- What's the fog test?

1337
00:58:08,111 --> 00:58:09,379
- You've met Kens before,

1338
00:58:09,412 --> 00:58:11,080
but you've never been
subjected to the fog test?

1339
00:58:11,114 --> 00:58:12,248
- No, never.

1340
00:58:12,281 --> 00:58:13,549
- Come on, it's
like their big move.

1341
00:58:13,583 --> 00:58:14,650
- I've never seen it.

1342
00:58:17,854 --> 00:58:18,688
Can you show me?

1343
00:58:22,058 --> 00:58:22,891
- Yeah, alright.

1344
00:58:29,031 --> 00:58:30,266
May I?

1345
00:58:30,299 --> 00:58:31,300
- Of course.

1346
00:58:43,613 --> 00:58:46,082
- Notice how it fogs
up for my breath?

1347
00:58:46,115 --> 00:58:54,824
Diamonds don't fog and, and.

1348
00:59:30,693 --> 00:59:33,931
- Here's a tip, in the
multiverse again is nice,

1349
00:59:33,963 --> 00:59:36,732
but whenever enemy you
may encounter is a Ken,

1350
00:59:36,766 --> 00:59:39,769
a fake diamond necklace soaked
in some peanut oil is better.

1351
00:59:41,537 --> 00:59:42,738
- Hey, get this,

1352
00:59:42,772 --> 00:59:46,676
I found another Ken with
a fake mustache, over.

1353
01:00:00,723 --> 01:00:04,393
- So, how does it work?

1354
01:00:04,427 --> 01:00:06,028
- Well, the reason
diamonds don't fog

1355
01:00:06,062 --> 01:00:08,564
is because they conduct heat
and disperse it quickly.

1356
01:00:08,598 --> 01:00:11,167
If entropy were reversed
and moved backwards,

1357
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,002
cold particles would
move through hot ones.

1358
01:00:13,035 --> 01:00:14,670
Your breath wouldn't
fog up a fake diamond,

1359
01:00:14,704 --> 01:00:17,006
the fake diamond would
neutralize your breath.

1360
01:00:18,641 --> 01:00:20,142
- Basically, whenever
you get somewhere new,

1361
01:00:20,176 --> 01:00:21,410
breathe on the diamond,

1362
01:00:21,444 --> 01:00:22,946
keep going until it
doesn't fog anymore.

1363
01:00:27,316 --> 01:00:28,718
- I'm worried I'm gonna
choose something else

1364
01:00:28,751 --> 01:00:30,319
if I can't remember what I had.

1365
01:00:31,487 --> 01:00:32,688
- Wouldn't that just mean

1366
01:00:32,722 --> 01:00:34,790
it's actually what
you really want?

1367
01:00:34,824 --> 01:00:39,829
- No, no, it would be
an impulsive mistake.

1368
01:00:40,129 --> 01:00:42,298
A split decision
based on instinct

1369
01:00:42,331 --> 01:00:44,567
rather than logic
and experience.

1370
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:47,570
- You can't still
think logically without
knowing your past.

1371
01:00:48,404 --> 01:00:51,407
- Don't we develop our own
logic based on our past?

1372
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,809
- Sure, but that's not
necessarily a good thing.

1373
01:00:56,112 --> 01:00:59,815
- Thank you for not eating me

1374
01:00:59,849 --> 01:01:02,618
and for helping
me get back to you

1375
01:01:03,819 --> 01:01:06,289
or trying to get back to you.

1376
01:01:07,723 --> 01:01:09,960
Not you, you but

1377
01:01:14,664 --> 01:01:16,232
I don't think I need to clarify

1378
01:01:16,265 --> 01:01:17,667
what I mean by that anymore.

1379
01:01:19,635 --> 01:01:20,436
You get it?

1380
01:02:01,477 --> 01:02:04,413
- So what are you gonna do?

1381
01:02:05,581 --> 01:02:07,450
- Well, no offense,

1382
01:02:07,483 --> 01:02:09,019
but when I went out
into the multiverse,

1383
01:02:09,052 --> 01:02:11,253
I was looking for a bit
more than half here.

1384
01:02:12,355 --> 01:02:13,189
- Right.

1385
01:02:15,424 --> 01:02:17,094
- So back out I go.

1386
01:02:20,863 --> 01:02:23,399
- So, when you do
find a universe

1387
01:02:23,432 --> 01:02:28,105
that makes you
wanna stay a while,

1388
01:02:28,137 --> 01:02:30,941
what do you do to the
Sydney who's there?

1389
01:02:30,974 --> 01:02:32,642
- What do you think?

1390
01:02:32,675 --> 01:02:34,243
- You kill them.

1391
01:02:34,276 --> 01:02:35,244
- I don't need to.

1392
01:02:35,277 --> 01:02:36,212
I show 'em the scary little gun

1393
01:02:36,245 --> 01:02:37,146
and they hop in the bathroom

1394
01:02:37,179 --> 01:02:38,915
and leave their universe to me.

1395
01:02:38,949 --> 01:02:40,383
- And that works?

1396
01:02:40,416 --> 01:02:42,218
- It'd work on me.

1397
01:02:42,251 --> 01:02:43,086
- Yeah, me too.

1398
01:02:47,156 --> 01:02:48,891
- You know why
everything's so fucked up?

1399
01:02:48,925 --> 01:02:50,593
- Like in general?

1400
01:02:50,626 --> 01:02:51,861
- With the multiverse?

1401
01:02:51,895 --> 01:02:52,695
- Why?

1402
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:55,598
- When we go through our lives

1403
01:02:55,631 --> 01:02:57,166
so worried about the
way we treat others,

1404
01:02:57,199 --> 01:02:58,167
that we start to lose track

1405
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:01,303
of how it is we're supposed
to treat ourselves.

1406
01:03:01,337 --> 01:03:02,973
When we become
completely detached

1407
01:03:03,006 --> 01:03:06,143
from consequence we have
no idea how to behave.

1408
01:03:06,175 --> 01:03:07,110
You disagree?

1409
01:03:07,144 --> 01:03:08,045
- With what?

1410
01:03:08,078 --> 01:03:09,445
The idea that
overwhelming selflessness

1411
01:03:09,478 --> 01:03:10,613
is humanity's fatal flaw?

1412
01:03:10,646 --> 01:03:12,214
Yeah, just a bit.

1413
01:03:12,248 --> 01:03:15,085
- I wouldn't call it
overwhelming selflessness,

1414
01:03:15,118 --> 01:03:18,721
I'd call it selflessness
only for fear of consequence.

1415
01:03:18,754 --> 01:03:21,257
We have laws that dictate
how we treat one another,

1416
01:03:21,290 --> 01:03:24,226
we have nothing to dictate
how we treat ourselves.

1417
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:25,227
- So what?

1418
01:03:25,261 --> 01:03:26,163
A little more self-care

1419
01:03:26,195 --> 01:03:28,664
and we'd esna the force
cannibalism?

1420
01:03:28,698 --> 01:03:30,332
- Well, is that what you
think we owe ourselves?

1421
01:03:30,366 --> 01:03:32,268
- The right to be left
alone in our own universe

1422
01:03:32,301 --> 01:03:33,602
without the threat
of being eaten?

1423
01:03:33,636 --> 01:03:35,771
Yeah, that's a good
place to start.

1424
01:03:35,805 --> 01:03:38,307
- Maybe.

1425
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:41,978
Or maybe we owe ourselves
the best universe we can find

1426
01:03:42,012 --> 01:03:44,613
even if it comes at the
expense of our other selves.

1427
01:03:49,019 --> 01:03:50,853
You're really gonna stay here?

1428
01:03:50,886 --> 01:03:52,254
- There's no solution
to my problem out there.

1429
01:03:52,288 --> 01:03:53,222
- I'm certain that there is.

1430
01:03:53,255 --> 01:03:54,091
- Based on what?

1431
01:03:54,124 --> 01:03:56,559
- The concept of
infinite possibilities.

1432
01:03:58,161 --> 01:04:00,763
- Well, not so much
infinite as we may think.

1433
01:04:00,796 --> 01:04:01,597
- Really?

1434
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,534
- No matter where I go or
what I find, I'm still me.

1435
01:04:05,568 --> 01:04:07,104
Whether I have a million
dollars in one universe,

1436
01:04:07,137 --> 01:04:08,771
or a PhD in quantum
mechanics at another,

1437
01:04:08,804 --> 01:04:10,506
I'm still Sydney, I
still have my head

1438
01:04:10,539 --> 01:04:11,440
and I still have my worries

1439
01:04:11,474 --> 01:04:12,708
and I still have my fears.

1440
01:04:14,911 --> 01:04:18,181
External solutions never
work for internal problems.

1441
01:04:22,618 --> 01:04:23,519
Ken's right.

1442
01:04:23,552 --> 01:04:24,787
- We all have a cannibalism.

1443
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:27,723
- No, not that
Ken, the other one.

1444
01:04:27,757 --> 01:04:29,291
Losing your past
doesn't make it go away,

1445
01:04:29,325 --> 01:04:31,393
it just sets us up to
create another one.

1446
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:36,066
- Well, you're the scientist,

1447
01:04:36,099 --> 01:04:38,101
best you can do is
test it and find out.

1448
01:04:40,336 --> 01:04:42,005
- If you do leave,

1449
01:04:42,038 --> 01:04:45,976
grab some tape and mark
the wall, something unique,

1450
01:04:46,009 --> 01:04:47,643
something we started
doing on the off chance

1451
01:04:47,676 --> 01:04:49,745
we make it back to somewhere
we've already been.

1452
01:04:51,114 --> 01:04:51,948
Be nice to know.

1453
01:04:53,616 --> 01:04:55,584
- Still try to make
some sense out of it?

1454
01:04:55,618 --> 01:04:56,786
- There's a pattern,

1455
01:04:56,819 --> 01:04:58,287
we just haven't
figured it out yet.

1456
01:05:26,016 --> 01:05:27,650
- I was just leaving, look.

1457
01:05:29,252 --> 01:05:33,023
- Fuck, I drew a penis too.

1458
01:05:37,493 --> 01:05:38,828
You dipped that in peanut oil?

1459
01:05:38,861 --> 01:05:39,762
- Yeah.

1460
01:05:39,795 --> 01:05:40,629
- Good.

1461
01:05:40,663 --> 01:05:41,630
- Where's yours?

1462
01:05:41,664 --> 01:05:42,899
- I gave it to a ken.

1463
01:05:42,933 --> 01:05:44,034
- To a ken?

1464
01:05:44,067 --> 01:05:46,903
- Not all bad, some Sydney's
are pretty fond of them.

1465
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:48,704
- Huh?

1466
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:53,542
- So, are you happy here?

1467
01:05:53,576 --> 01:05:56,112
- Would I be getting in
the bathroom if I was?

1468
01:05:56,146 --> 01:05:57,479
- May not solve your problem.

1469
01:05:57,513 --> 01:05:59,849
- Maybe not, but staying
definitely won't.

1470
01:05:59,882 --> 01:06:00,616
- How do you know?

1471
01:06:00,649 --> 01:06:01,517
- What do you mean?

1472
01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:02,885
Because I remember
what's gonna happen.

1473
01:06:04,353 --> 01:06:08,191
- You remember what's
going to happen?

1474
01:06:08,225 --> 01:06:10,126
- Listen to this,
I have this theory,

1475
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,195
that since all possible
outcomes are realized,

1476
01:06:12,229 --> 01:06:14,130
there must exist a
universe in which

1477
01:06:14,164 --> 01:06:16,166
the principles of
thermodynamics are reversed

1478
01:06:16,199 --> 01:06:19,069
or don't exist at
all, imagine that,

1479
01:06:19,102 --> 01:06:20,636
a universe where I
could remember my past.

1480
01:06:20,669 --> 01:06:22,305
If I could remember
what I've done,

1481
01:06:22,339 --> 01:06:23,439
I could learn from my mistakes,

1482
01:06:23,472 --> 01:06:24,607
I just have to find it.

1483
01:06:29,346 --> 01:06:31,214
- We're never gonna
be happy, are we?

1484
01:06:31,248 --> 01:06:35,517
- No, but maybe we were.
