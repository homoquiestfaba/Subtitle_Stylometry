1
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,110
Unknown: swift was being
satirical. Right? And that that

2
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:03,870
is very different than if they
were being ironic. But satire is

3
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,330
not to be confused with

4
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,010
irony.

5
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,260
Now, can anybody give me an
example of the ladder? Can

6
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,920
anyone give me an example of
irony?

7
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,670
Terrific. Oh, Helen, what a
surprise. The alum from the

8
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,770
character development program,
did he?

9
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:28,230
Yes.

10
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,800
So,

11
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:33,780
no, no,

12
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,960
no, no. isn't really support
your point. Can anybody help

13
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,360
Helen out for I fail her?

14
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,030
kill myself.

15
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,970
What I think Ellen's trying to
say is

16
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,290
Hello, hi there. You know,
there's this fantastic but a

17
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,420
protocol that students really
for generations have been

18
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,040
enjoying that looks a little
something like

19
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,989
well, Hi, Mr. Long. Do you have
a yes. I think what Helens

20
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:15,989
trying to say is that it's
ironic that we had a

21
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:19,109
motivational speaker professing
his happiness that didn't seem

22
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:22,979
very happy. Hmm. I mean, what
was the budget for this thing?

23
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,439
10 bucks now. cafeteria lunch.

24
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,750
I didn't realize we were an AP
open mic. Alright. Well, barring

25
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:36,480
your last comment. Your point is
that the speaker's demeanor was

26
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,870
ironic, but not so much a speech
is that right? I mean, they both

27
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,550
have to exist in order to create
the irony, but I also take issue

28
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,920
with the speech itself. Okay. So
I mean, life isn't rainy and

29
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,140
then sunny. It's happy than it's
sad. Just nature birth to death.

30
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,960
God, you should have been born
in France.

31
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,940
Little cammo. And that's an
awfully bleak view, don't you

32
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,720
think? For someone who's only 17
years old? I mean, really. I for

33
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,050
one would like to hear that life
view in full if possible at an

34
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,140
assembly and given that our
character development program is

35
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,410
nominating for people. This
semester. I'm going to nominate

36
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,090
you as a representative for the
senior class.

37
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,380
Mr. Angelo, I was just trying to
help Helen out why don't you

38
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,780
just make her do it? I actually
happen to appreciate your life

39
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,030
perspective and would love to
hear it. It's just I'm the last

40
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,190
person that should be doing
while you're doing it. Awesome.

41
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,260
Okay, and that was sarcasm.

42
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,430
Which you don't really have time
for but we'll get to next week.

43
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,320
How's class?

44
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,990
Think Angelo thinks I think

45
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,030
he's just like that. I don't
last year he's making me a

46
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:50,010
motivational speech thing. can
maybe does. But look, I got drum

47
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,650
team later today we're doing
these auditions so I won't be

48
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,720
able to drag them into late say
430. Ladies. You know what? You

49
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,960
should come audition for the
team next time. Bright lights

50
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,720
and audience all the attention
you ever wanted might be fun.

51
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,070
Really? No. Tell me again. Why
you have to audition for a club.

52
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,780
Norman. It's not a club. It's a
team we compete to get leather

53
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,380
jackets.

54
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,030
So can it be today

55
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:55,140
you

56
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,430
Sure, we'd love for you to play
with us.

57
00:05:07,859 --> 00:05:09,209
Okay, cool.

58
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,790
I'm sorry. I was just being
ironic.

59
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,170
Zima

60
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,080
Hey, pops.

61
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,260
Are you doing

62
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:53,820
Dr. Malloy call back the lab
stuff? Oh, no, at least at least

63
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,330
another day or

64
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:55,950
so.

65
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:03,360
Right. I got in trouble with the
English teacher, Mr. Snyder.

66
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,940
What? Oh, no, that was last
year. Really? Yeah. Did you see

67
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,360
this letter? Probably not. They
all kind of look the same to me.

68
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:16,020
Well, this one has big red
letters on it.

69
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,280
So third notice from the phone
company, they're going to shut

70
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,950
us off. Apparently, when?
Supposedly yesterday.

71
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,800
Oh, who needs a phone anyway?

72
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,640
I'll take care of it. I will

73
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,910
worry one little bit.

74
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,730
There was something missing.

75
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,930
JOHN. All right. So almost done.

76
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,390
Is it true?

77
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,690
The back then, men and women
slept in different beds for like

78
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,740
married men and women?

79
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:28,350
Well, no. And the truth is that
back then man had a very, very

80
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:31,620
long penises, and they had to
sleep in separate beds.

81
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,910
We still didn't have the one
thing that could give us a

82
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:39,900
better way of life.

83
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:53,520
Why, Norman? Can I talk to you
for a sec? Yeah, yeah. I just

84
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,300
wanted to

85
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,750
apologize if I was rude in class
the other day and

86
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:04,530
yet With that said,

87
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,990
You know, I appreciate that.
Honestly. Oh. Good news, your

88
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:15,030
your nomination as official
senior speaker went through? Oh,

89
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,400
yeah. But I was sort of hoping
that I wouldn't have to do it.

90
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,310
You know, of course you have to,
but I just apologized.

91
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,840
Norman my signing of that speech
wasn't a punishment of had

92
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,110
nothing to do with you being
rude. I mean, I genuinely liked

93
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,150
your perspective. Okay, but you
heard it I mean, that's it.

94
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,580
That's that's as good as it
gets. I got nothing else to

95
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,140
give. Yeah, I don't know. I I
have a kind of a hard time

96
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:37,680
believing that.

97
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,360
Okay.

98
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,570
It's gonna be great. Thanks,

99
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:55,950
guys.

100
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,270
I'm really late. Sorry.

101
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,340
Thanks for helping me pick up my
books like Gee, you're welcome

102
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,580
when girl. Hey, you're hot. We
should date

103
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,280
I forgot to say thanks.

104
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,140
I'd rather slit my wrists and go
in there James. So you really

105
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,360
just gonna sit out here and wait
for me to drive home.

106
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,550
I hope to change mine.

107
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,180
Have fun

108
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,330
Hey,

109
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,330
My name is James. I'm the senior
class captain of the drama team

110
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:09,900
this year.

111
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:15,779
Now, if you're not here for
society of Thespians, you're in

112
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:20,339
the wrong place if you're here
for a society of lesbians. My

113
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:22,829
mother's book club meets on
Tuesdays.

114
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:29,220
The first step, the new student
in our midst, the lovely Emily

115
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:29,970
Harris.

116
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,400
Know Me

117
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,680
it's called here's what I like
about acting so much

118
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:53,280
for acting America by Gilda von
Trapp, aged eight, eight.

119
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,600
Acting is fine. It's cool fades
lights are hot, but that's okay.

120
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,200
You're supposed to spend a lot
that's when my mom says she

121
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,610
knows that daddy's doing a
really good job. Sometimes when

122
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,600
it's really dark and quiet and
I'm all alone.

123
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,390
Except for my imaginary friend
Rita and her imaginary dog

124
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:22,230
witness in his magical offering
up I like to pretend that I'm

125
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:25,740
somebody else and that's why I
like acting because it makes me

126
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,550
feel free and that's what
America is all about is being

127
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:34,350
free and that's why I'm applying
to acting America because they

128
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,370
both stand for free

129
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,530
you could call it free free

130
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,340
awesome

131
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,490
yeah, no thank you. Thank you
Emily.

132
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:03,240
Next stuff we have coming is
masky

133
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,820
that Polish

134
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,170
Hey

135
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,000
will continue to boil in your
house by the sea

136
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,910
All right. Next up we have Helen
black.

137
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,860
You okay.

138
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,640
Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks.

139
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,560
Thanks for being my only fan
back there.

140
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,160
Anything What? Did you learn
anything?

141
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,880
I haven't actually checked yet.

142
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,960
Well, it says try again. Hold
on.

143
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,630
Nope, not the time either.

144
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,420
Botox

145
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,090
now we have tardy Norman

146
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,000
okay.

147
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:30,870
Just

148
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,760
I had a grand dream while in
high school. One day I would

149
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,790
call a school wide assembly
louder.

150
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,940
One day I would call a school
wide assembly.

151
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:54,270
And, you know, everyone in the
school would show up, because I

152
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:58,320
had just learned how to make
fake glass, which is a highly

153
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,970
guarded secret recipe by

154
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,690
I feel I can share it with you.
It's Carol syrup, and sugar. So

155
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:10,500
I would set up basically huge
sheets of this glass all over

156
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,850
the stage and then I'd you know,
punch it or kick it better yet

157
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,700
break it over my head. And
everybody would be surprised and

158
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,740
impressed that I hadn't hurt
myself.

159
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,170
So after the whole class, but
after everybody got into that

160
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,980
frame of mind of seeing me cheat
death, I would

161
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,820
sit on the edge of the stage,

162
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:40,800
put a paper bag over my head,
pull out a gun, and blow my

163
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,430
brains out.

164
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,980
And people would laugh and
giggle until they realized that

165
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:51,810
unlike the whole glass bit, the
gun brains

166
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:53,940
all that was real.

167
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:01,860
A few nights ago, I attempted to
kill myself. Nothing with the

168
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,920
finance or showmanship of the
dream but rather just a boy

169
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,210
alone. No room with a knife.

170
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,930
incredibly sad kid who had
nothing to look forward to that

171
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:16,350
day.

172
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,110
I was stopped, though by my
goodbye letter. Because you see,

173
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:26,820
I couldn't decide who to trust
to to dear everybody, or just

174
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,840
dear assholes. And these are
obviously crucial decisions when

175
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,590
one is contemplating suicide.
Because you see, and this is the

176
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,750
moral of the story, folks.

177
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:45,270
It's not how important one feels
when one dies, but rather how

178
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:46,560
guilty

179
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,080
everybody else feels.

180
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,340
Thank you.

181
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:11,730
Hey,

182
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,670
hey, hey.

183
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:18,210
That's you

184
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:25,230
know, just waiting for my ride.
Gotcha. Your parents pick it up.

185
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,720
No, I run with James. James.
James. Really?

186
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,140
Sorry to disappoint.

187
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,630
Think I'll get over it.

188
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,840
I think he's back there talking
with Bradley.

189
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,010
That sucks.

190
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,540
Why?

191
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,670
No, I just, I mean, I have to
get home. So

192
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,230
why?

193
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:54,780
So many questions?

194
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:01,710
I actually need to go to the

195
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,620
doctor's office.

196
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:06,150
Right.

197
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:13,050
I need to pick up a medical
report right now.

198
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,270
Hey, have you ever seen the
Monty Python sketch about the

199
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,290
Spanish Inquisition?

200
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:30,210
That's sort of random thing to
ask. But

201
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:32,700
I guess

202
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,000
nobody expects the Spanish
Inquisition. The weapon is the

203
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,030
ruthless efficiency.

204
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,900
My dad loves Monty Python.
That's cool.

205
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,480
Okay, now you asked me a
question.

206
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,920
Okay, Emily,

207
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,560
what brings you to this
exceptional institution of

208
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,100
learning?

209
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,750
Well, here they have really good
fish.

210
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,940
Wow.

211
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:13,680
And my mom got a job at the
university. So

212
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,630
basically, what do you think so
far? I got high school is pretty

213
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,350
much the same.

214
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,960
Except this one has a Norman

215
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,150
I gotta go.

216
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,770
I wanted to tell you, I really
like to audition in there. It's

217
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:39,090
kind of weird, but again, Linux
plays it from

218
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,990
it was just some you know,
contemporary, obscure t next

219
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,270
thing, you know, the usual.

220
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,490
Did you really have that dream?

221
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:55,890
Good.

222
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,970
Well, hopefully I see you on the
list tomorrow.

223
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,670
by James

224
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,020
smarty pies

225
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,010
on dry on

226
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:39,270
go start sometime kiddo. Yeah, I
know just not today.

227
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:52,560
No, it's okay like your old fart
stations. I was saying play

228
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,250
close to you

229
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:58,020
did the carpenters know? Oh
yeah, they did

230
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,700
that for me all the time. God it
was annoying

231
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,040
sure sure got a year ago

232
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,100
What is it? What is a alright
cam. Oh, God

233
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,390
did you want me to drive because
I can drive I can drive you can

234
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,740
pull over and I can drive right
now.

235
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,770
You scared me

236
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,200
I don't get it.

237
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,370
What am I looking for? It's a
big envelopes probably on the

238
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:14,760
counter.

239
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,570
Norman bring it back. Don't open
it.

240
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:26,940
Don't open it.

241
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,720
Hi. picking something up
productive.

242
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,750
reached a long family Murray dog
and

243
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,320
we're not here. So leave a
message. Thanks.

244
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,770
Trying to think about this
positively.

245
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:40,830
I really have no

246
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,470
I know.

247
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,720
I'm not going anywhere. I'm
going to stay with you here as

248
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,020
long as I can. I mean, well,
maybe you should just try

249
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:55,350
another round of chemo arm and
I'm a doctor. Remember I know

250
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,650
how this goes. That was a while
ago. Already. You don't know

251
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:01,500
maybe your your body would react
differently this time. I think I

252
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,600
need to be alone. So

253
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,840
I'm going to try to get some
sleep. Okay.

254
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:13,680
Okay.

255
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,040
Hi, you've reached the wrong
family, Marie.

256
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,420
More, down here. Please

257
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,320
write the write down.

258
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,990
Robert, what are you doing?

259
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:07,289
surance

260
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:12,480
power of attorney that Norman
upside?

261
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:14,970
Norman

262
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:20,850
Norman Do you remember Mr.
perset? Hey, Norman. No, I

263
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:21,270
don't.

264
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,970
I'm your dad's attorney. We need
to talk about my will. Okay,

265
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,020
well, I gotta go to school. No,
I know. I know. But this is good

266
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,210
time as any Yeah. What better
way to start the day.

267
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,570
I'm leaving. And

268
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:43,170
we have to have this
conversation not with him. I was

269
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:46,020
just discussing some options
with your dad. There's certain

270
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,890
logistics and we still have to
figure out like, for instance,

271
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,980
where you're going to live. You
know, maybe you could sell the

272
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,190
house and live with Aunt Judy
and Judy. And judy is older than

273
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:59,370
the ocean. She has 20 cats and
turtle she she calls me Leon.

274
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:00,690
Alright, then.

275
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,130
You live with a friend or I
don't know you could stay here.

276
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,400
Okay. You know, I gotta go.
Norman. Don't walk away from me.

277
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,830
These are important decisions.
Why do I have to make them?

278
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,980
Seriously why and nobody else
does. All they're worried about

279
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:17,040
is you know who they're going to
go to prom with or where they're

280
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,110
going to get drunk this week?
And that's all they should have

281
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,420
to worry about. I just want to
go to school. Okay.

282
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:32,310
Why Norman? Why am I always
waiting for you? What I mean, I

283
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:35,070
waited for you this morning. I
waited for you yesterday.

284
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:44,970
I walked home yesterday. James
walked home. That is totally

285
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:48,030
absurd. I stood around in that
parking lot for over an hour.

286
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,780
Sorry. Sorry. No, I'm not gonna
let you pull that shit on me

287
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:55,710
Norman. Honestly, your dad can't
drive you he's a doctor James.

288
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:59,220
He works weird hours. Okay,
well, I'm gonna drive you around

289
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,010
like your personal chauffeur.
The nice he can do is be on

290
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:04,800
time. Okay, okay, whatever.
Whatever.

291
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:11,850
Set the list. We normally

292
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,990
don't My favorite part is is
that you asked me to audition.

293
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,280
And then you don't even cast me
I wanted to cast but I decided

294
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,060
to leave one slot open because I
just can't trust you. The only

295
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,450
thing walking home proves is
that you can be self consumed.

296
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,000
dict No, I didn't have the
slightest clue on Earth where

297
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,360
you were last night. You have no
cell phone, no email, no

298
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,300
voicemail. Now your home phone
is off. The unabomber could get

299
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,940
in touch faster than you can.
And that would all be fine if

300
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,760
you weren't fucking flicking out
all the time. I wish I could

301
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,490
depend on you, Norman, but I
just can't. And that's why your

302
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:53,040
name's not on James. You should
always be able to trust your

303
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,880
best friend. Even if I wanted to
you freak everyone out yesterday

304
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,400
with that psycho audition of
yours. I mean, what the fuck was

305
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,390
that? Norman it was sick. Oh,
yeah, really? I'm tired of

306
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,330
you're suicidal? Nobody loves
me. Bullshit. We're all supposed

307
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:08,640
to sit around wondering if
you're gonna put a paper bag

308
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,310
over your head and blow your
brains out. I'm done with you,

309
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:14,310
Norman everything is not a
fucking joke. Yeah, I know. It's

310
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:18,960
not a joke. Do you? Fuck you
man. You really you don't know

311
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,110
anything? Okay, you really don't
What don't I know normally tell

312
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,160
me what I don't know.

313
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,890
Like I've got cancer us Oh my
god. I swear me Norman. The pity

314
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:34,800
game is over grow up. I was
looking for pity and cancer.

315
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,420
That's way over the line of
being funny.

316
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:38,670
It's not a joke.

317
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,290
You know what that is? Looks
like a piece of shit with light

318
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:48,210
shine through it. That friend is
cancer. And this is my stomach.

319
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:55,230
What? Three months from now and
you'll know that you were wrong

320
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,040
on this one.

321
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,620
Are you serious?

322
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:10,170
Why don't you just catch, Tom.
Good. I'm glad you're done with

323
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:14,460
me. I can't wait to do this on
my own. Just pull over. I'm not

324
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,220
gonna turn. We're gonna turn the
car over James. I'm done talking

325
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:17,730
about No.

326
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:24,630
I'm not gonna pull over Norman.
We're gonna talk to me. Shut up

327
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,080
normally.

328
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,350
Stop shopping.

329
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,390
Please, we need to talk about
this.

330
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:35,460
Norman

331
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,210
Norman Jesus Christ.

332
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,870
Norman. Hey.

333
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:51,750
Hey, what are you doing up
there? I'm just staring out the

334
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,460
bathroom creeks pretty bad. So

335
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,460
my good deed for the day.

336
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:59,910
Hey, do you see the list? Yeah.

337
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,800
You're on it. Really?

338
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,300
Are you?

339
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,630
Are you mad? Well, I was kind of
mad but it's hard to stay mad

340
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:13,050
when you're shouting at a pretty
girl airing at a bathroom. That

341
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:16,050
reeks. Hey, me, me. No, I want
to give you a hug.

342
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:17,610
Oh,

343
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,270
I'm really sorry normally.

344
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:32,580
I'm really sorry.

345
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:38,220
It's alright. It's like, wait, I
supposedly James can depend on

346
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,170
me for whatever reason, and

347
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:44,460
I don't I just feel kind of
stupid to put yourself out

348
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,310
there, you know, and I it's
better to try a bunch of

349
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:47,820
bullshit.

350
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:52,290
I'm sorry. That was. That was
mean. I didn't know you're

351
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,640
right. It is a bunch of
bullshit.

352
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,800
Well, thank you

353
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:04,650
for coming down here. That heart
was probably the nicest thing

354
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,120
anybody's ever done for me.

355
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,180
Hello, James. How could you not
talk? I don't want to talk about

356
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,180
a breakup that isn't for you.
Are you? cancer? That's not

357
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,000
something keep from your best
friend to change. No. I mean,

358
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,450
just tell me how bad is it
assure you? I'm not gonna show

359
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:27,930
that like.

360
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:33,750
Oh my god. Is that true? No, no,
no, I don't I don't. Is it true?

361
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,300
You should see the X ray. I
mean, Jesus. I can't even

362
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,740
believe you're coming to school.

363
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:44,250
I don't have I don't know.
Sorry. Norm.

364
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:48,750
What's the book? What the book
was that? What did you just do

365
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:52,050
you want to still play dumb,
James? Why did you just tell

366
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,690
her? I didn't tell her. She
heard me What's wrong?

367
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:59,430
I mean, she was just being nice
to me. Because me. I mean, there

368
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:04,020
was no other reason. What am I
doing now? It's all screwed up.

369
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:08,610
Look, I know this is gonna sound
stupid, but I want you to take

370
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:09,540
that open slot.

371
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:14,280
It's yours. I don't want it. I'm
sorry. I didn't plan to trust

372
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,950
you and just put your name down.
I'm an asshole. Alright.

373
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,370
I had no idea what was going on
with you.

374
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,570
But you have to promise not to
tell anyone else. Okay, you

375
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,630
can't tell anyone. If that's
what you need. Okay. Yeah.

376
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,950
Normally, you should take it.

377
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:40,530
Fine. I'll take it.

378
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,230
I'll take it.

379
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:51,660
That

380
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,550
norm. What are you doing out
here?

381
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:00,330
How was your day?

382
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,180
It was a pretty bad

383
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,090
day. Today. Dad.

384
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,300

00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:01,740
Your lungs.

394
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,900
Cancer hurts here.

395
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,900
is just like a really bad
stomachache.

396
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:34,650
Does it hurt?

397
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,350

By the way, I don't need to
write on Monday. Why

403
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,380

404
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,650
When I mean, I'm just going to
be

405
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,190

407
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:23,340

00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,580
Yeah, twice.

415
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,900
Yes, twice. Kind of reminds me
of somebody.

416
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:56,880
Hey, hey, feelin. Not too bad. I
have to say. Ready for a little

Speed Racer.

00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:04,620
Let me get my helmet here. Hurry
up or change my mind.

419
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:08,790
All right, no, no, when you
release the clutch, you put

420
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:11,580
equal pressure on the gas equal
equal press? Yes, I do. You're

421
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,280
not given a gas. Okay. All
right. Okay. All right.

422
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:17,880
Okay.

423
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,490
Little faster than I remembered.
Okay. And when you hear the

424
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:26,460
engine strain, you feel a strain
put put in second. Alright.

425
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,070
It's not moving.

426
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,010
God damn it.

427
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:39,570
starting up again.

428
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,160
Come on. It's okay. You'll get
it. I will be doing donuts in

429
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,660
the mall parking lot before
we're done.

430
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:58,830
is just still so scary.

431
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,680
It's a bad memory.

432
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:03,960
Scare

433
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,270
to think that.

434
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:14,880
At that moment, she knew what
was happening to her.

435
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:17,550
No, I don't think she'd

436
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:26,580
come up. That's good. Okay. All
right.

437
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:28,350
Yeah.

438
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,880
All right. No, throw it back to
you. All right, equal pressure

439
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,300
equal pressure shaft and more
gas.

440
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,260
Norman

441
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,720
wait.

442
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,190
Norman James.

443
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:24,990
James does something seem
different? I can explain.

444
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:30,720
Everybody knows everybody knows
what but your cancer. Ah, well

445
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:33,840
attacked is impressive.

446
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,720
But is that for the king?

447
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:45,240
Look if there's anything I can
do no chemo, carpal. Remember,

448
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:49,140
look, if you go bald, I go bald.
Do that for you.

449
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:51,750
Thanks, man.

450
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:59,880
So, did everybody find out why
everyone at practice asked me

451
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:02,850
and I told them it was true. So
you broke your promise? Yeah, I

452
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:06,960
did. But I got trapped. It's
spread all over the school.

453
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:09,360
Spread How? Like cancer.

454
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,420
You don't stop.

455
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,640
Wait, so

456
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,240
you're not mad at me? No.

457
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,870
No, surprisingly not.

458
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:23,940
I've heard you sounded off.

459
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,630
No, I'm gonna go talk to her.

460
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:29,850
Yeah.

461
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:31,860
Emily.

462
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:34,950
Hey.

463
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:41,160
How's it going? Good. All
things. Considered. I'm good.

464
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:45,330
Everyone's been talking about
you today. It's kind of surreal.

465
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:48,240
Does it wears you out?

466
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,660
So we're new. Oh,

467
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,960
no, no, not really, like

468
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:03,540
the Fonz now, sort of a leather
jacket? cancer.

469
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,570
Sorry.

470
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,610
Can I ask you a question? Yeah.

471
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:17,340
I actually was wondering if you
wanted to go to the parade with

472
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:21,150
me. Next Friday. You asked me on
a date.

473
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:27,840
Well, yes, I thought I was
blind. Did I do something wrong?

474
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:29,730
No. That's perfect.

475
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,920
Okay, I'll see you later then.
Hi. All right. Bring him in.

476
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,200
Bring him in. Excellent. Comic
boy.

477
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,230
I want to apologize

478
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,530
for being a douche to you.

479
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:54,240
You know, if you want to play
ball with us, we'll be shooting

480
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,350
some hoops after school.

481
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,840
Well, thanks, Frank. But that's
what's called too little too

482
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,230
late.

483
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:04,950
Gotcha.

484
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:07,710
Yes, I deserve that.

485
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:13,440
And that's all you'll ever need
to know about anything. Your

486
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,330
essays are due by the end of the
week. Oh, Norman, you You left

487
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:19,440
your book under the desk?

488
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,780
Yeah, I you know, I didn't want
to pull that whole out. kind of

489
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,850
see you after class. I mean, for
everybody. I mean, it's just

490
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:33,360
embarrassing.

491
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:35,820
I have a seat you.

492
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:44,520
Look.

493
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:48,270
I've

494
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,760
I've heard a rumor.

495
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:54,870
And I just wanted to know
whether or not it was true.

496
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,070
Do you have cancer?

497
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:05,160
What?

498
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:10,230
What kind of, no, no, I don't
have cancer.

499
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,270
I can understand you wanting to
be in complete.

500
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:17,850
denial.

501
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:20,610
Wanting to slough it off.

502
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:26,430
I can't even begin to imagine
how scary This is. Are you being

503
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:27,660
treated because

504
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,640
I don't know. Everyone in school
seems to think that it's that

505
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,180
it's pretty great. Is that true?
Everyone in schools and yet?

506
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,170
Yeah, that's true.

507
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:41,070
argue that point?

508
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,100
Look, I'm

509
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,070
I want to tell you something.
Okay. A

510
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:57,330
bunch of years ago, before I
moved here. Now my wife got very

511
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:57,810
sick.

512
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:03,600
people when they lose somebody,
they're left with all these

513
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:06,990
unresolvable feelings.

514
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:12,929
Right? I mean, they're there,
they're furious. They're sad.

515
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:19,590
To guilty. I guess. What I'm
saying is, is that people are

516
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,370
going to need you to relieve
them of these feelings.

517
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,430
You know, there's this bit in
the Bible, I think, the most

518
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:30,390
human and real

519
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:36,960
in the entire Bible, where Jesus
asks not to carry that burden.

520
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:40,710
Sound like everybody's

521
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,570
Jesus. Yeah, well, sort of
sorta. Okay.

522
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:49,440
You're comparing me to Christ.
That's cool, I guess.

523
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:51,870
But I don't

524
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:58,200
I don't understand what am I
supposed to do? Well, you could

525
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,110
maybe talk about what you're
going through in your speech.

526
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,540
Look, I can guarantee you that I
cannot get up there and start

527
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,800
talking about having cancer.

528
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:08,160
Well, look, is there anything
else that you like doing that

529
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,350
you want to do that could help?

530
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:22,950
Make a movie and movie first
wanted to make a movie? I think

531
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:23,580
that could work.

532
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:26,310
In fact, that might be better.

533
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:30,450
You could film things little
things, moments of your life.

534
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,040
Like me dying.

535
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:33,570
No.

536
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:37,920
You can document your living a
little moments.

537
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,220
Things that are meaningful
things that you've come to

538
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:43,440
appreciate and ways that maybe
you otherwise might not have

539
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:44,040
been able to.

540
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:48,360
I don't expect you to be able to
wrap your head around this right

541
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,690
now. But I I just really want
you to try and take this from

542
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:52,020
me.

543
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:54,600
You

544
00:46:55,620 --> 00:47:00,600
You have an opportunity to
change the lives of everyone

545
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:02,550
that you know.

546
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:09,870
Christmas.

547
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,890
Merry Christmas. Merry
Christmas. Merry Christmas.

548
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:20,160
What's for you today? Who came
last night?

549
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:25,500
Yes. And what does it bring for
you? Looking for those presents?

550
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:27,180
Ready? Go find yours.

551
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:30,510
It's Christmas time.

552
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,510
My dad

553
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:42,480
Hey.

554
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:49,530
Ready? You ready? Ready for the
raspberry? Are you

555
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:50,940
ready?

556
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,890
Ross is my video to say goodbye.

557
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:05,160
Recently

558
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:07,890
I found out that I had cancer

559
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:14,250
that I was dying of cancer. That
I had approximately three months

560
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:14,610
to live.

561
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:20,070
Gentlemen The following is a
reenactment of me getting onto

562
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:20,730
the drama team

563
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:42,300
really just

564
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:44,880
normal guy with

565
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:47,820
massive muscles.

566
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:59,070
armies a little evil cancer guys
just eaten away with this

567
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:01,620
job.

568
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:06,840
But it's

569
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:17,280
seriously ladies.

570
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:22,410
Gentlemen likes

571
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:29,700
like insulted spam and spam spam
in case ships spam.

572
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:32,130
So sorry.

573
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:36,300
No.

574
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,470
What are you thinking about?

575
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,040
A little bit about you.

576
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:49,770
Good stuff, I hope. Yeah, some
good stuff.

577
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:56,370
Some sad stuff too, but I'm just
gonna let the good stuff be

578
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:56,640
good.

579
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:03,900
Think about my favorite thing
like I don't know Tamra monkeys

580
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:07,860
or Billy Crystal running to Meg
Ryan and When Harry Met Sally or

581
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:08,310
Oh my god,

582
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:11,490
Christmas sometime we should
drink eggnog and go Christmas

583
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:14,970
caroling? Yeah, yes, I agree.

584
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:24,030
Jingle all the way Oh what fun
it is to ride in one horse open

585
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:24,840
sleigh Hey.

586
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,930
day or two ago I thought I'd
take a ride. Miss Fanny Bright

587
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,810
Was seated by my side how hot
the horse was leaning like

588
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:37,380
Misfortune seemed as we got into
a drifted bank And then we got

589
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:40,920
upset. Hey, no, those those are
the real words.

590
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:47,940
My mom was like this. You know,
Christmas.

591
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:55,350
She was this Christmas Nazi and
she used to make me and my dad

592
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:59,790
sit around the tree and read
Carol's out of her caroling

593
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:00,450
book.

594
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:07,140
That's sweet. It was sweet. It
was probably also the dorkiest

595
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:12,180
family thing she ever made us
do. But last year for Christmas.

596
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:16,140
We all wore matching sweaters
for our cards. You were

597
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:19,440
wondering Oh yeah, big green and
red sweaters with no men on

598
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:19,620
them.

599
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:21,690
Well, you were

600
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,900
pretty sexy. I have to wear for
you sometime.

601
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:34,920
I'm sure you look

602
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:36,720
beautiful.

603
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:40,230
Just like

604
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,630
my mom. I was supposed to be
home like a half an hour ago.

605
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:47,340
Okay, well, listen.

606
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:53,190
Can you do me a favor and not
call me tonight?

607
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:59,790
Okay, I mean, I can't. Anyway,
but why?

608
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:03,300
Well, I don't know. This is all
kind of

609
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,990
new and I want to take it in.

610
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:10,800
Okay, wait, but why can't you
call me?

611
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:15,840
home phone doesn't work. I don't
have a cell phone. So

612
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,880
we'll have to deal with that
tomorrow. Okay, you're good.

613
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:21,990
Bye.

614
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:33,240
Normally, this one I love you to
death. Your crappy cook. Just

615
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:38,490
considered payback for all those
years. You made me vegetables as

616
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:43,080
I was making strong. Imagine the
raw strength you possess after I

617
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:47,280
make you a smoothie full of
broccoli, carrots and Brussels

618
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,850
sprouts Beets tomatoes made it's
not a vegetable.

619
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,400
Was that?

620
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,690
No, don't go let him go away.
What if it's Girl Scout? Oh, no,

621
00:52:57,690 --> 00:53:00,300
no, no, no whatever. They leave
it even if it's girls.

622
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:05,040
Hey, Norman. Thank you for
coming.

623
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,110
You welcome.

624
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:13,320
Dad. It's Dr. Malloy.

625
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:17,490
Dog.

626
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:23,040
Okay, Norman. Doug Norman asked
me to come over. Oh, Jesus

627
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,790
Christ Norman dead. He says that
you should be in the hospital

628
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:27,630
right now.

629
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:32,790
Yeah, well, you know, he knows
God damn well as I do that last

630
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:36,210
place I should be is in a
hospital. Dog at least let me

631
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:40,170
send a hospice worker over.
We're doing fine on our own.

632
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,920
That how are you going to know
unless you try Norma stop.

633
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:49,350
Phil is stupidly trying to act
like a doctor instead of my

634
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:52,560
friend. mean, this is our last
few moments and I will not let

635
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,390
either one of you take them away
from me.

636
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,130
Time to go, Phil.

637
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:02,250
Thanks for coming. Norman.

638
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,380
Close the door.

639
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,920
I may be sick, but I'm still a
boss around here.

640
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:15,180
If you need anything, you call
me.

641
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:19,410
Okay, thank you.

642
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:30,900
If he the monster, or
victorious, I shouldn't be a

643
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:35,160
piece. If he were vanquished,
then I should be a free man.

644
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:38,250
Okay.

645
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,600
So now that everyone's finished
reading the book,

646
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:50,100
wondering if anybody could tell
me how this quote is indicative

647
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:50,940
of its theme.

648
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:55,260
I'm not asking for a mind
blowing discourse here. You can

649
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:59,880
save that for your essays due
next Friday. I just want you to

650
00:54:59,910 --> 00:54:59,970
know

651
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,150
Tell me what you think the theme
of Shelley's Frankenstein is?

652
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:09,240
Okay, you know, sometimes the
best way to approach a theme is

653
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:12,300
through train of thought. Right?
How does it make you feel?

654
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:14,100
Norman?

655
00:55:15,719 --> 00:55:20,339
Yes, you're the volunteer. I
didn't raise my hand straight.

656
00:55:20,999 --> 00:55:24,779
Now everybody put your pencils
down. Norman, I'm gonna ask you

657
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:27,629
to close your eyes. Okay, and I
want you just to just to give

658
00:55:27,629 --> 00:55:30,629
yourself over to a sort of
stream of consciousness. Okay.

659
00:55:30,749 --> 00:55:33,509
Whatever you think whatever you
feel about the theme of this

660
00:55:33,509 --> 00:55:37,949
book is perfect. Okay, you can
make it up. That's better in

661
00:55:37,949 --> 00:55:41,639
fact, yeah. Okay, but what is
this for? In preparation for

662
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:42,179
Joyce?

663
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:43,980
Your I shot?

664
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:46,140
Yes.

665
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:48,390
Whenever you're ready.

666
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:52,950
Okay.

667
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:00,780
Okay, well, if he the monster
were victorious.

668
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,200
Then he the monster

669
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:11,490
the monster within us. The
monster within us grows. Monster

670
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:12,420
grows like

671
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:16,980
cancer. What else grew up plants
grow with lots of water plants

672
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,920
grow like little boys. Little
girls with pink shoelaces little

673
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:20,850
boys with little

674
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:25,260
blue cancers look like little
orange explosions dropping on

675
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:28,650
them like in Japan from all the
radiation.

676
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:33,750
Monster consuming one victim to
the next. But on the inside.

677
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:36,570
Everything's reversed. The
monster is our companion. The

678
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:38,610
monster is our destroyer, the
monster.

679
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:44,820
That's all I got.

680
00:56:53,790 --> 00:56:54,120
All

681
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:57,690
right.

682
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,290
I just wanted to tell you, I'm
sorry. You got upset in class

683
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:06,030

684
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:08,580

thank you. Cool.

686
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:14,820
I also wanted to tell you, I
think that you're very

687
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:17,850
provocative and moving. I just
wanted to tell you that. Oh.

688
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:20,880
Thanks. I

689
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:22,920

690
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:25,860
hair. I like your face.

691
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:31,530
Alright, guys, let's get
started. While we warm up with

692
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:32,940

693
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:50,730
The good thing good to

694
00:57:52,530 --> 00:57:53,400

695
00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:01,950

696
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:16,860
say something don't bore there's
no shame

697
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:24,060
is No.

698
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:30,480
Go ahead, say something dumb.

699
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:42,900
This is good. This is this is
fun, right? Yeah. This is the

700
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:47,160
best date I've ever been on.
Yeah. I mean, it's the only day

701
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:50,340
I've ever been on But wait, I'm
your first.

702
00:58:53,370 --> 00:58:57,660
I mean, nobody's ever really
taken an interest in me before

703
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:03,750
is nothing more sexy than self
pity. Well, then I suck. I was

704
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:04,320
kidding.

705
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:09,030
Oh, damn, I do something. It's a
great date. Norman.

706
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:14,610
Well, hey, it's not over yet.
Where? Where do you want to go

707
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:15,270
next?

708
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:20,850
I don't know. Want to go to your
place? Yeah, let me think No.

709
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:23,820
Why? What's wrong with your
place? You don't want to go to

710
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:27,240
my place. Okay, trust me. It's
just me and my dad. It's

711
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:31,320
overflowing with masculinity,
dirty dishes and laundry. I

712
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:34,080
don't care about that stuff. I
want to meet your dad or well

713
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,790
let me ask you what what would
bother you?

714
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,450
No, no, seriously, just name
anything. It could be anything

715
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:40,920
that would bother you. What is
it?

716
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,080
Frozen head? Well, this is good.
This is why I asked we have a

717
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:50,490
whole freezer dedicated to
frozen had specifically ones of

718
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:53,730
girls that I bring home. So
really? Yep. That I was your

719
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:54,300
first day.

720
00:59:55,410 --> 00:59:57,630
hookers don't count as dates.
Yeah.

721
00:59:59,730 --> 00:59:59,970
Okay.

722
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,890
We don't have a freezer full of
heads but we are looking. I want

723
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:07,890
to meet your dad. Emily please
just don't don't push this. What

724
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:10,650
do you mean don't push this? I
have to push it Your home is

725
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:11,520
your life. Come on. Okay.

726
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:17,160
Where would a rock be if it
wasn't pushed? A rock? Yes. A

727
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:22,530
rock? Is it a magical route?
It's not a magical rock. Where

728
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:23,130
would it be?

729
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:29,850
Nowhere. Exactly. Nowhere. Okay,
well, that is one of the most

730
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:32,130
profound things I've ever heard.
Honestly.

731
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:35,670
Look, I have no idea what you're
talking about right now. But we

732
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:38,220
go to your place

733
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:43,140
your house your life. Right.

734
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:47,760
Look at that. Our first
argument.

735
01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:00,900
So how long should we wait?

736
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:04,080
Until my parents like goes out?

737
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:11,040
hanging out in the car. What to
do what to do?

738
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:18,630
You know, I used to set my alarm
every day for 336 and then when

739
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:21,210
it would go off I would
intentionally do something to

740
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:22,200
harm myself or

741
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:26,730
get hurt or you know just
anything self destructive,

742
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:27,180
basically.

743
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:33,870
But I don't do it anymore.

744
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:42,660
Okay, and things which I do.
Just anything I could find when

745
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:43,770
it went off.

746
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:49,410
I mean, the last thing I
remember doing was auditioning.

747
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,090
But they

748
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:57,690
they met me I know it's the most
positive self destruction ever.

749
01:02:01,170 --> 01:02:02,130
That's not smile.

750
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:03,960
No, no.

751
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:07,950
Happy

752
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:15,360
lights off.

753
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:23,250
Keep your eyes closed.

754
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:25,290
They're closed.

755
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:30,330
Open them

756
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:34,980
was

757
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,200
Holy shit. That's

758
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:39,990
it go through a sexy

759
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:45,150
What else? snowman

760
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:51,060
that's somewhat forward.

761
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:01,710
Thank you. A lot.

762
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:05,940
Okay, I really, I really do. I
mean,

763
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:10,260
so don't start making advances.
It's just

764
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:16,290
I've never been advanced upon
before. I mean,

765
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:20,850
I'm like the Switzerland of
heterosexual boy. It's just

766
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:21,900
neutral.

767
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:25,320
I mean, I guess hurting the
Nazis. Gold wasn't exactly

768
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:29,370
neutral. So I'm like the
mythical image of Switzerland.

769
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:31,110
making those jokes and

770
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:34,980
I've just never been

771
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,680
with a girl before.

772
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:41,400
In a room like this late at
night.

773
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:46,410
I've never been liked by a girl

774
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:48,390
before

775
01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:53,220
it's really good feeling.

776
01:03:56,820 --> 01:03:57,150
Hear?

777
01:03:58,530 --> 01:03:58,800
You're

778
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:02,100
just here. Put your head on my
lap.

779
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:09,150
Okay,

780
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:13,380
okay, you have to close your
eyes. Just trust me.

781
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:18,210
Okay, ready.

782
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:25,200
My mom used to do this when I
was

783
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:27,810
younger and I couldn't sleep.

784
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:33,120
She called it face trace.

785
01:04:34,590 --> 01:04:35,880
Pretty soon.

786
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:39,120
My eyes are closed.

787
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:42,780
worries.

788
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:50,190
Ultimate feeling of comfort.

789
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:53,550
Safety

790
01:05:06,779 --> 01:05:07,679
Sound is

791
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,410
always on Yoshi

792
01:05:13,469 --> 01:05:14,339

01:05:16,049 --> 01:05:19,349

795
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:29,250
Can I move my leg?

796
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:40,770
bodily

797
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:45,210
one say to segue into more
kissing

798
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:50,520
What if he hadn't been born into
st

799
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:55,950
What if you were 75 now

800
01:05:59,010 --> 01:06:03,000
wood are convinced. Good thing I
read what's happening to my body

801
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,930
for boys last night. Cookies and
oh folks

802
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:15,570
can I meet her?

803
01:06:16,590 --> 01:06:19,410
I don't know that. I mean it's
only been like a month or 39

804
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:20,250
days or whatever.

805
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:22,740
I want to meet her.

806
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:29,400
I got to celebrate.

807
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:33,390
Hey,

808
01:06:34,770 --> 01:06:38,940
you see that cabinet over there?
top shelf is the Bible of 18

809
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:42,600
year old scotch and I've had it
for 18 years so it's a bottle 36

810
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:43,440
year old scotch

811
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:48,420
Your papa Sam gave it to me. I
brought you home from the

812
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:48,870
hospital

813
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:57,450
All right. What do you what do
you want me to do with very good

814
01:06:57,450 --> 01:06:58,890
goddamnit celebration?

815
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:04,290
This one

816
01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:10,200
looks old.

817
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:32,160
Toast

818
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:44,460
is

819
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:46,380
there burns

820
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:49,170
if I can do it again.

821
01:08:58,110 --> 01:08:59,430
There we go.

822
01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:41,070
What you did it remember?

823
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:48,270
Mine fell out. I just want to
see how it feels. Oh my god

824
01:09:48,270 --> 01:09:49,800
Norman sees

825
01:09:51,930 --> 01:09:55,470
I guess it's too late to say
don't do it. Holy

826
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:03,660
I'm not doing chemo again if
that's what you think I'm not.

827
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:08,520
Yeah, I know dad just. It's a
fashion statement here. Will you

828
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:12,060
help me to do the back here? I
can't really see.

829
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:15,900
Oh my goodness.

830
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:19,080
Buddy.

831
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:24,000
Maybe that scotch was a bad
idea.

832
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:55,920
This is my video to say goodbye.

833
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:00,540
Recently, I found out that I had
cancer

834
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:06,180
that I was dying of cancer. That
I had approximately three months

835
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:06,870
to live

836
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,250
I won't even make it to
Christmas.

837
01:12:13,050 --> 01:12:15,120
I'm sorry baby Jesus don't

838
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:23,760
danceable I start again.

839
01:12:32,580 --> 01:12:35,160
Yes, friends, students, faculty.

840
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:40,530
Every day My life is a living
hell. My stomach feels like it's

841
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:43,110
so cracked well, filling with
hot sand.

842
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:51,120
Apparently he mustered enough
strength first. Drink water. Hi,

843
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:52,380
you've reached the last family.

844
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,340
We're not here. So leave a
message.

845
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:12,360
Are you still going to show your
movie on Monday?

846
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,610
I was

847
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:19,560
planning on it.

848
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:24,870
We're going to show it just like
the movie. We're going to talk

849
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:25,170
about it.

850
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:31,950
I don't know. I hadn't really
thought about it.

851
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:37,470
Are you gonna come?

852
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:51,720
I'm sorry.

853
01:13:54,450 --> 01:13:55,350
I'm so sorry.

854
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:57,720
It's fine.

855
01:14:00,150 --> 01:14:03,720
Everything's gonna be fine.

856
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:06,030

Christmas?

857
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:09,960
On Christmas Day, whatever it
is, I'll get it for you. As long

858
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:14,130
as it's like under $320. Listen
to me.

859
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:21,150
I look at you and

860
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:23,580
you amaze me.

861
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:27,660
You're so strong through all of
this. You have such

862
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:32,490
strength and and I just admire
you so much.

863
01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:36,120
I look at you when I see what an
incredible person you are. And

864
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:39,090
it just frustrates me to think
that you've spent most of your

865
01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:40,980
life not having faith in
yourself because people have

866
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:44,880
always thought they were smart
and funny. And if there's one

867
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,740
person in this world that I
would have faith in

868
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,230
you didn't know something. Okay?

869
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:06,210
It's not because of the cancer.

870
01:15:42,390 --> 01:15:43,410
But aren't you say

871
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:48,030
please

872
01:15:49,770 --> 01:15:50,790
Can I at least commit?

873
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,610
I'm sorry. No, he did nothing
wrong.

874
01:16:15,390 --> 01:16:16,740
I just want you to know.

875
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:21,420
You, too.

876
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:36,750
Nermin. Now.

877
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,740
You got to help me get Chuck.
Okay.

878
01:17:19,050 --> 01:17:22,980
You got to help me right? You
can do it. You got it. You can

879
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:23,280
do it.

880
01:17:42,690 --> 01:17:43,920
You have to leave now.

881
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:50,070
Why are you still here? Why
didn't you leave? Because I

882
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:54,390
wanted to come back. Okay, we'll
just go go. Okay. Why are you

883
01:17:54,390 --> 01:17:56,940
doing this? Just let me in. I
wouldn't be with you.

884
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:06,120
Emily needs you to just go Okay.

885
01:18:10,830 --> 01:18:12,900
Go. No,

886
01:18:15,450 --> 01:18:17,100
no, no, man, I'm pushing him
now.

887
01:18:19,170 --> 01:18:20,070
I don't know how much

888
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:23,220
money to spend every second.

889
01:18:53,070 --> 01:18:57,210
You don't have cancer. You don't
have cancer.

890
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:00,570
Please, just open the door.

891
01:19:07,650 --> 01:19:10,050
But just listening. What do you
mean you don't have cancer?

892
01:19:11,190 --> 01:19:15,150
Please just come. Please just
come on. Look, just listen, em.

893
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:45,180
Okay.

894
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:50,130
Everything that I've ever wanted
to do in terms of, you know,

895
01:19:50,130 --> 01:19:54,930
whatever dreams that I've had,
I've put in this drawer. As you

896
01:19:54,930 --> 01:19:59,910
can see, I'm a man of many
dreams. I've been doing this

897
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,110
Since I was really young so
there's lots of weird crazy

898
01:20:04,110 --> 01:20:05,730

break away

903
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:27,660
I don't have called dying being

904
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:30,600

If you need anything, you just
give me a call right.

917
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:33,450
I would really love to honor
your father in that way.

918
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:36,600
Thank you, sir.

919
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:42,240

01:22:03,330 --> 01:22:03,900
My dad

01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:07,800

You're gonna have a good life.

929
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:27,960
You guys just trust me on

930
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:31,440
this.

931
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:39,330
I want to thank you for letting
me do this the way

932
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:41,190
I know it was

933
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:43,620
was really hard on you. And

934
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:45,840
I didn't mean to be

935
01:22:48,150 --> 01:22:48,600
like

936
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:56,910
Oh, no.

937
01:22:58,830 --> 01:22:59,190
Oh,

938
01:23:00,210 --> 01:23:01,950
no. I'm okay. I'm okay.

939
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:05,040
This wait nor Just

940
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:06,900
wait.

941
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:15,240
Wait, wait, wait. Sweet.

942
01:23:16,290 --> 01:23:20,070
I'll give you a hug. No, no, no,
no.

943
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:09,240
Moving is tiring.

944
01:24:14,760 --> 01:24:15,930
Loving makes your time

945
01:24:18,810 --> 01:24:19,710
especially good.

946
01:24:45,390 --> 01:24:45,870
Hi, guys.

947
01:24:58,260 --> 01:24:58,680
Hey,

948
01:25:01,770 --> 01:25:05,010
Your mom's so funny. She cracks.

949
01:26:34,950 --> 01:26:37,530
If you can't think outside the
box, think outside the circle.

950
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:38,070
Thank you.

951
01:26:47,850 --> 01:26:52,620
I have the privilege to
introduce our next speaker. Over

952
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:55,950
the course of the last few
months, I've had the pleasure of

953
01:26:55,950 --> 01:27:00,600
getting to know this guy and
he's bright. He's funny, and

954
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:06,750
he's courageous in the face of
inordinate adversity. So,

955
01:27:07,110 --> 01:27:11,430
colleagues, students one cool
kid, Norman long.

956
01:27:45,690 --> 01:27:50,100
There was going to be a video
today but actually,

957
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:57,000
actually, now there's not a
video

958
01:28:03,330 --> 01:28:04,830
I just came from

959
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:09,000
I just came from the hospital
and I didn't think I was gonna

960
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,050
come here. It's

961
01:28:11,070 --> 01:28:11,730
kind of

962
01:28:12,870 --> 01:28:14,490
weird that I did.

963
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:18,660
It's really intimidating being
appeared.

964
01:28:22,050 --> 01:28:25,290
I underestimated you guys.

965
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:28,230
But to be honest,

966
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:31,830
you overestimated me.

967
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:34,650
Because

968
01:28:36,090 --> 01:28:37,290
the truth is,

969
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,670
the truth is, is that

970
01:28:50,430 --> 01:28:52,290
I don't have cancer.

971
01:28:59,430 --> 01:29:01,680
can only imagine the disgust,

972
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:06,270
disappointment that you're
feeling towards me? Believe me,

973
01:29:06,270 --> 01:29:09,840
it's nothing compared to what
I'm feeling about myself.

974
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:12,420
You know, I

975
01:29:14,550 --> 01:29:17,820
didn't mean to turn it into some
big joke.

976
01:29:18,990 --> 01:29:21,570
Obviously, I had no right to
that.

977
01:29:29,790 --> 01:29:32,040
Um, oh, now.

978
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:35,340
myself.

979
01:29:38,220 --> 01:29:42,660
But as my late father said,

980
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:47,130
that's really all you ever need.

981
01:30:07,620 --> 01:30:09,330
All right, we

982
01:30:10,620 --> 01:30:11,580
settled down.

983
01:30:12,690 --> 01:30:13,140
Right?

984
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:59,190
Hi, you've reached the wrong
family Marie.
