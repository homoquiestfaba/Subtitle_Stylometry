1
00:01:16,362 --> 00:01:18,831
In the twinkling
of an eye.

2
00:01:39,323 --> 00:01:41,654
More... more!

3
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:55,506
More, more!

4
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:59,943
Later...
Magic is very exhausting...

5
00:02:00,449 --> 00:02:04,511
and I am 542 years old.

6
00:02:04,821 --> 00:02:07,290
Oh... you don't look
a day over 200.

7
00:02:07,491 --> 00:02:12,953
Yes, I'm still as bad as
ever I was.

8
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:23,375
We'll continue after
I've got my rest.

9
00:02:56,817 --> 00:02:58,683
Thank you for not telling
your friend the Demon.

10
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,682
He's not my friend,
he's my husband.

11
00:03:02,991 --> 00:03:05,620
He keeps me in that box
because he's so jealous.

12
00:03:06,596 --> 00:03:07,892
I saved you from him.

13
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:14,036
And now you must make love to me,
while my husband sleeps.

14
00:03:15,474 --> 00:03:18,033
If you don't,
I'll wake him up...

15
00:03:18,377 --> 00:03:20,311
and he'll rip your head off.

16
00:03:46,877 --> 00:03:48,743
Oh, not again, Sayid.

17
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:52,216
Giafar,
I had that dream again.

18
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:55,512
The Demon's wife, she tried
to kill me, so I killed her.

19
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:57,245
You've had it now
for five years...

20
00:03:57,456 --> 00:03:59,687
ever since your late wife
tried to do the same thing.

21
00:03:59,893 --> 00:04:02,123
- I murdered her...
- It was an accident, Sayid.

22
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,594
It was an accident!

23
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,963
Allah is just.
You're free of her, Sayid.

24
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,639
I'll never be free of her,
she haunts me still.

25
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,999
Don't let her.

26
00:04:12,207 --> 00:04:15,145
Don't you forget, I have to take
a wife by the next full moon...

27
00:04:15,346 --> 00:04:17,644
or the kingdom will be given
to my dear brother.

28
00:04:17,881 --> 00:04:19,610
May he rot in hell!

29
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:21,479
Your father wanted you
to marry.

30
00:04:21,686 --> 00:04:24,382
I can't take another wife, she'll try
to kill me too, they all will!

31
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:25,318
You must.

32
00:04:25,524 --> 00:04:28,891
You lose the kingdom unless you
marry as quickly as possible.

33
00:04:29,095 --> 00:04:31,496
I know what it means...
even the Demon was betrayed...

34
00:04:31,698 --> 00:04:33,257
the dream tells me all wives
are treacherous.

35
00:04:33,468 --> 00:04:36,028
No, no, you just had
a bad experience, Sayid.

36
00:04:36,237 --> 00:04:38,433
There's only one way to deal with
wives, they have to be executed.

37
00:04:38,641 --> 00:04:41,166
Well, I'm sure we've
all felt like that.

38
00:04:41,376 --> 00:04:43,937
I will marry. There will be a
wedding and a wedding night...

39
00:04:44,147 --> 00:04:46,377
but in the morning,
I'll have my wife executed.

40
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,484
I'll kill her before
she kills me.

41
00:04:49,386 --> 00:04:52,880
She can't be a princess of the blood,
her death would cause problems.

42
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,784
Pick me a woman from
the Harem, Giafar.

43
00:04:56,027 --> 00:04:58,190
Someone bright and happy...

44
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,390
and with no thought
for the future.

45
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,495
And in secret...
now send for the Chief Executioner.

46
00:05:37,244 --> 00:05:39,611
But that was not the end
of the story.

47
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:45,580
After Douban was beheaded,
the King licked his fingers...

48
00:05:45,788 --> 00:05:48,120
and turned to the page
in the dead man's book.

49
00:05:48,423 --> 00:05:53,158
He stared at the words,
and then slumped forward...

50
00:05:53,731 --> 00:05:54,721
dead!

51
00:05:55,332 --> 00:05:57,630
The pages of the book
had been poisoned...

52
00:05:58,436 --> 00:06:03,374
so that the King, wetting his finger,
had executed himself.

53
00:06:12,887 --> 00:06:14,149
Here again, mistress.

54
00:06:15,324 --> 00:06:17,121
That's the sixth time
this week.

55
00:06:17,326 --> 00:06:20,159
These people sit for hours
just listening...

56
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,295
it's a miracle.

57
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:25,629
People need stories more
than bread itself...

58
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:29,164
they tell us how to live,
and why.

59
00:06:40,488 --> 00:06:41,919
Sorry I'm late, father.

60
00:06:42,122 --> 00:06:45,286
This is my daughter, Scheherazade.
She's my strong right arm...

61
00:06:45,493 --> 00:06:47,358
you may speak freely
in front of her.

62
00:06:47,828 --> 00:06:49,024
How is the Sultan?

63
00:06:49,231 --> 00:06:52,201
The Sultan is being eaten
by the worm of madness...

64
00:06:52,436 --> 00:06:55,233
it reminds me a little
of the case of Gilgamesh...

65
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,408
the king of Urak when his friend,
the grand warrior...

66
00:06:57,608 --> 00:07:02,011
- Can you cure the Sultan?
- No... only Allah can do that.

67
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,308
- How was Gilgamesh cured?
- It was a young woman who did it.

68
00:07:05,518 --> 00:07:10,046
No one knows how... a complete
amateur. Beginner's luck.

69
00:07:10,457 --> 00:07:13,222
That sort of thing can be really,
really distressing...

70
00:07:13,427 --> 00:07:15,861
for an experienced professional
like myself.

71
00:07:16,063 --> 00:07:17,964
When did Schahriar
become so ill?

72
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:21,625
When I played with him as a child in
the palace he was always so happy.

73
00:07:21,937 --> 00:07:23,166
Everybody loved him.

74
00:07:23,372 --> 00:07:26,364
Madness creeps in unseen
and floods the soul.

75
00:07:26,576 --> 00:07:27,703
You're no help!

76
00:07:27,912 --> 00:07:29,776
Patients often say that,
but what do they know?

77
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:31,346
Should I get
a second opinion?

78
00:07:31,548 --> 00:07:33,881
Why not?
I can come back tomorrow.

79
00:07:39,391 --> 00:07:41,292
I didn't know Schahriar
was this ill.

80
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:43,622
I've been trying to keep it
from everybody.

81
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:46,264
You look terrible, father.

82
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:50,427
Oh, it's only natural. I have to deal
with the worst kind of madman...

83
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:53,306
a madman with power!

84
00:07:54,243 --> 00:07:55,768
You understand
what is needed?

85
00:07:55,978 --> 00:07:58,175
I know my job, Sayid.

86
00:07:58,948 --> 00:08:01,850
You wish your bride to be executed
the morning after the wedding.

87
00:08:01,987 --> 00:08:03,079
Early.

88
00:08:03,822 --> 00:08:07,156
There are certain procedural
problems, Sayid...

89
00:08:07,425 --> 00:08:09,827
as I will be executing
her after the wedding...

90
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:12,224
it means she will be Sultaness...

91
00:08:12,432 --> 00:08:15,890
who by tradition cannot be
hung or beheaded.

92
00:08:16,102 --> 00:08:17,731
Details... details!

93
00:08:17,938 --> 00:08:21,136
Never fear, Sayid, where
there is a will, there is a way.

94
00:08:21,342 --> 00:08:23,537
- I can strangle her.
- That's what I want.

95
00:08:23,746 --> 00:08:26,682
But, I can't use hemp rope...

96
00:08:26,883 --> 00:08:29,443
...not on a royal throat.
- Must I be crossed at every turn?

97
00:08:30,053 --> 00:08:32,420
But there's no objection
to silk!

98
00:08:32,623 --> 00:08:36,024
A silk rope would fulfill
all legal requirements...

99
00:08:36,828 --> 00:08:38,624
rely on me, Sayid.

100
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,167
They haven't seen
each other for years.

101
00:08:47,374 --> 00:08:49,774
That's enough, girls.

102
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,412
Scheherazade.

103
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,447
The Sultan's going
to kill us!

104
00:08:58,654 --> 00:08:59,986
- Who told you that?
- My mother.

105
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:01,413
She got it from the cook...

106
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,595
who got it straight from the Chief
Executioner's Assistant, it's a secret.

107
00:09:04,796 --> 00:09:06,729
And her mother's never wrong.
I heard it from a handmaid...

108
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:09,025
...who heard it from one of the guards.
- He's going to marry one of us.

109
00:09:09,234 --> 00:09:11,428
In the morning after the wedding he
is going to have the bride executed.

110
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:14,664
- He's mad, isn't he?
- And it won't stop there.

111
00:09:14,873 --> 00:09:16,808
He'll get a taste for it
and kill us all!

112
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,410
I'm sure it's just a rumor.

113
00:09:22,383 --> 00:09:24,112
Don't worry,
I'll talk to my father.

114
00:09:26,922 --> 00:09:29,288
- Father, I must speak with you.
- What are you doing here, child?

115
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:30,823
Put some clothes on,
Father, it's urgent.

116
00:09:31,027 --> 00:09:32,153
I blame your late lamented mother,
it's all her fault.

117
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:33,557
Please be quick, father...

118
00:09:33,764 --> 00:09:35,891
or they'll say you're meeting women
in the steam room.

119
00:09:37,835 --> 00:09:41,101
The women in the Harem are frightened
that it won't stop at one girl...

120
00:09:41,306 --> 00:09:43,240
the Sultan may get a taste
for killing them.

121
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:47,139
If Schahriar wasn't the Sultan he'd be
locked away till the madness passed.

122
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,771
He was such a loving boy...

123
00:09:51,051 --> 00:09:53,646
we used to climb his father's
favorite peach tree.

124
00:09:54,355 --> 00:09:56,687
One day I fell and cut myself.

125
00:09:58,026 --> 00:09:59,857
He bound up the wound.

126
00:10:00,563 --> 00:10:04,966
Oh, what am I going to do, child?
I can't go through with this.

127
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:07,158
I can't pick a poor girl
from the Harem...

128
00:10:07,369 --> 00:10:09,635
knowing I'm condemning
her to death!

129
00:10:10,808 --> 00:10:13,243
I may have a way out
for you, father.

130
00:10:14,612 --> 00:10:17,138
I'll marry
Sultan Schahriar myself.

131
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,856
I won't let you sacrifice
yourself for me.

132
00:10:32,068 --> 00:10:33,228
I'm not doing it for you, father...

133
00:10:33,436 --> 00:10:35,734
I'm not even doing it
to save the girls in the Harem...

134
00:10:36,072 --> 00:10:38,439
I'm doing it for Schahriar
and myself.

135
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:40,032
I love him.

136
00:10:40,244 --> 00:10:43,702
No, you love the boy he was,
not the man he is.

137
00:10:43,915 --> 00:10:45,383
That boy is still
there in him.

138
00:10:45,584 --> 00:10:48,814
You'd have to dig very, very deep
to find him, he's changed completely!

139
00:10:49,187 --> 00:10:51,452
It's not just betrayal
by his wife and brother...

140
00:10:51,656 --> 00:10:54,353
absolute power has eaten
his soul. I know him...

141
00:10:54,561 --> 00:10:56,894
you think you can change him,
but you can't. No one can.

142
00:10:57,097 --> 00:11:01,035
- I don't believe that.
- Scheherazade, listen to me, listen!

143
00:11:01,235 --> 00:11:04,466
You are all I have.
I beg you.

144
00:11:05,475 --> 00:11:06,999
I beg you!

145
00:11:07,211 --> 00:11:08,802
Don't do this!

146
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:11,103
I can save him from himself...

147
00:11:11,648 --> 00:11:12,877
I don't know how...

148
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,848
but I've made up my mind.
I know I can do it.

149
00:11:34,811 --> 00:11:37,176
Daughter, when you walk out
onto that balcony...

150
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:41,009
you'll be married and you will have
signed your own death certificate.

151
00:11:41,217 --> 00:11:44,619
If you love me,
please, please, please...

152
00:11:44,822 --> 00:11:47,222
...please, don't do this.
- I know what I'm doing, father.

153
00:11:47,424 --> 00:11:51,190
You don't. You have no idea
what you're doing.

154
00:12:12,021 --> 00:12:16,789
Sayid, your brother, Schahzenan,
wishes to offer his blessings.

155
00:12:17,495 --> 00:12:19,486
May they choke him.

156
00:12:20,397 --> 00:12:22,696
He wants to be reconciled...

157
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:26,268
it would be good, Sayid,
for peace.

158
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,001
Think of the people.

159
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,334
Show them you're
brothers again.

160
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,854
Schahzenan, kill him! Kill him!

161
00:13:23,808 --> 00:13:24,831
Oh, my love.

162
00:13:30,483 --> 00:13:32,383
Traitor!

163
00:13:39,794 --> 00:13:44,128
No, no.

164
00:13:55,713 --> 00:13:58,376
I hope you have better luck
this time, brother.

165
00:13:59,016 --> 00:14:02,283
Your late wife loved me
from the first.

166
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:21,038
How will we know
when Sultan's ready?

167
00:14:21,544 --> 00:14:22,806
Be cool.

168
00:14:24,514 --> 00:14:30,978
I think pink will suit
the Sultaness.

169
00:14:32,224 --> 00:14:34,054
You have such good taste, Chief.

170
00:14:56,219 --> 00:14:58,381
Sayid, do you remember me?

171
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,083
From when we were children.

172
00:15:03,128 --> 00:15:07,065
We played together here
in the palace, then I went away.

173
00:15:07,266 --> 00:15:09,235
I don't remember anything
about my childhood.

174
00:15:09,436 --> 00:15:11,632
What's to remember?
I was a child! Why should I?

175
00:15:51,053 --> 00:15:52,610
What is it, Sayid?

176
00:16:17,384 --> 00:16:18,908
I don't trust you.

177
00:16:20,822 --> 00:16:23,791
There's something going on
I don't know about.

178
00:16:25,595 --> 00:16:28,155
Your Giafar's daughter,
yet he let you...

179
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:31,333
marry me.

180
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,301
Oh, I dream too much...

181
00:16:39,377 --> 00:16:40,869
forty nights...

182
00:16:42,013 --> 00:16:43,914
can't sleep...

183
00:16:45,218 --> 00:16:47,185
so I dream.

184
00:16:49,156 --> 00:16:51,557
My father always takes a glass
of wine and a biscuit...

185
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:52,953
before going to bed.

186
00:16:53,161 --> 00:16:56,620
This isn't a night when
a man is supposed to sleep.

187
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:02,765
There.

188
00:17:08,246 --> 00:17:09,644
Is something the matter?

189
00:17:12,818 --> 00:17:16,914
That biscuit has sesame seeds...

190
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:21,486
I don't like sesame seeds...

191
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,935
- Did I say something funny?
- No.

192
00:17:29,573 --> 00:17:33,099
It's just that "sesame"
remind me of this wonderful story...

193
00:17:33,842 --> 00:17:35,505
would you like to hear it?

194
00:17:38,281 --> 00:17:39,682
I don't like stories.

195
00:17:40,151 --> 00:17:41,413
You will this one.

196
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:44,920
It's about Ali Baba
and the forty thieves.

197
00:17:47,393 --> 00:17:48,825
Forty thieves?

198
00:17:50,897 --> 00:17:54,196
Forty nights of dreaming, and now
Forty Thieves... That's strange!

199
00:17:54,401 --> 00:17:58,668
Yes, but no stranger than
the story itself.

200
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:05,370
You see, Ali Baba was a poor young
man who lived outside Damascus.

201
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:11,516
His best friend had a hump,
four legs...

202
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:13,620
and very big teeth.

203
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:17,926
Saffrow was one of the wisest
camels in all Syria.

204
00:18:25,739 --> 00:18:29,370
Ali Baba's only family was
an older brother, Cassian.

205
00:18:30,078 --> 00:18:32,637
I know Saffrow, I know.

206
00:18:33,514 --> 00:18:34,778
Cassian!

207
00:18:36,084 --> 00:18:37,485
Wake up!

208
00:18:38,453 --> 00:18:40,752
It's time to get up.
Come on.

209
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,462
Unlike his young brother,
Cassian was so lazy.

210
00:18:46,765 --> 00:18:50,496
I told you
I don't like stories.

211
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,769
A master storyteller
once told me...

212
00:18:56,143 --> 00:18:58,442
the audience must be hooked
in the first moments...

213
00:18:58,646 --> 00:19:01,171
otherwise you've lost them.

214
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:02,781
I'm lost.

215
00:19:10,427 --> 00:19:13,795
That's because I haven't told
you about Black...

216
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:16,896
Black Coda.

217
00:19:19,003 --> 00:19:22,564
At the time the Kingdom was being
ravaged by savage gangs.

218
00:19:24,711 --> 00:19:27,772
Black Coda led
the most murderous of them.

219
00:19:29,383 --> 00:19:30,543
A monster.

220
00:19:30,852 --> 00:19:31,943
Black...

221
00:19:33,021 --> 00:19:34,112
Coda.

222
00:19:36,025 --> 00:19:37,515
No one was safe.

223
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,323
What's he got to do
with Ali Baba?

224
00:19:40,529 --> 00:19:42,828
He made Ali Baba rich and famous.

225
00:19:54,346 --> 00:19:56,837
No caravan could travel
without fear.

226
00:19:58,184 --> 00:20:02,052
They never Knew when or where
Black Coda would strike next.

227
00:20:03,424 --> 00:20:05,825
He was a master of disguise.

228
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:03,393
Meanwhile, Ali Baba was collecting
firewood to sell in the local market.

229
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,130
He was a really good-hearted
young man.

230
00:21:07,001 --> 00:21:09,765
It's a slow way to make
a fortune, Abdul...

231
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,203
and I've so many good ideas
for making money...

232
00:21:16,078 --> 00:21:20,174
like my scheme for watering plum trees
with alcohol to grow stewed plums.

233
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:30,092
I don't care what you think, Saffrow,
I think it's a good idea.

234
00:21:41,742 --> 00:21:43,334
You think that's trouble,
do you, Saffrow?

235
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,810
I think you're right.

236
00:21:53,322 --> 00:21:55,723
Saffrow's warning saved Ali Baba.

237
00:21:56,895 --> 00:21:59,693
Animals can be cleverer
than their masters.

238
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:02,097
And you can trust them.

239
00:22:04,837 --> 00:22:06,271
Open Sesame!

240
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:35,298
Down!

241
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,752
Open Sesame!

242
00:23:52,449 --> 00:23:53,609
Down, boys!

243
00:23:56,453 --> 00:23:57,546
Down.

244
00:25:39,212 --> 00:25:41,076
Open Sesame!

245
00:25:54,763 --> 00:25:55,890
Saffrow!

246
00:25:56,266 --> 00:25:58,734
Saffrow! We're rich!

247
00:25:59,202 --> 00:26:01,068
Have you ever seen
anything like it?

248
00:26:01,272 --> 00:26:04,639
Only in your wildest dreams!
Well, not in your dreams, in mine.

249
00:26:13,586 --> 00:26:14,780
It's raining.

250
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,483
Mother, bring in the washing.

251
00:26:17,691 --> 00:26:20,319
No, it's not raining, your mother's
been dead for five years. Get up!

252
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,987
- What's for breakfast?
- Fresh air.

253
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:24,755
Why are you sleeping on the edge
of the bed?

254
00:26:24,966 --> 00:26:26,195
So I can just drop off.

255
00:26:26,402 --> 00:26:29,099
Well, get up...
I've got something to show you.

256
00:26:40,453 --> 00:26:41,817
We're going to have
to move house...

257
00:26:42,253 --> 00:26:44,722
in case the robbers find out
who was in their cave.

258
00:26:45,925 --> 00:26:46,913
I want my share.

259
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:48,525
Of course.
I don't want it all for myself.

260
00:26:48,728 --> 00:26:50,629
- What half-and-half?
- Half-and-half.

261
00:26:50,831 --> 00:26:52,993
I'm going to the cave to get my share.
No, it could be dangerous.

262
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,633
I can take care of myself.

263
00:26:55,003 --> 00:26:56,562
If you must go, take Saffrow,
she knows the way.

264
00:26:56,771 --> 00:26:58,069
She'll see you don't get
into any trouble.

265
00:26:58,273 --> 00:26:59,764
Saffrow's a camel!

266
00:26:59,976 --> 00:27:03,606
"You don't think I need a camel
to look after me, do you?"

267
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,076
Both Ali Baba and
Saffrow nodded.

268
00:27:06,283 --> 00:27:07,478
There was no question
in their minds...

269
00:27:07,685 --> 00:27:10,449
that Cassian certainly needed
someone to look after him.

270
00:27:11,155 --> 00:27:13,647
Why was Cassian
any different from Ali Baba?

271
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,885
Ali had something Cassian
never had...

272
00:27:17,097 --> 00:27:18,564
a good heart.

273
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:21,426
You think a good heart
can protect people?

274
00:27:21,635 --> 00:27:24,765
Have you ever known anyone
with a good heart?

275
00:27:24,973 --> 00:27:25,961
No.

276
00:27:26,173 --> 00:27:29,143
Well, anyway, with Saffrow's help...

277
00:27:29,344 --> 00:27:31,209
Cassian found the robber's cave.

278
00:27:37,888 --> 00:27:38,980
Open!

279
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:42,583
What is it?

280
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:46,193
Open... open.

281
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,026
Ali Baba had given to
Cassian two biscuits...

282
00:27:49,236 --> 00:27:50,965
to remind of the password.

283
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:53,934
"Open sesame!"

284
00:28:10,794 --> 00:28:12,228
Down boys!

285
00:28:12,797 --> 00:28:13,958
Down!

286
00:28:39,462 --> 00:28:40,690
I must get Saffrow.

287
00:28:44,001 --> 00:28:45,800
Open... open!

288
00:28:47,139 --> 00:28:50,370
How was it, then?
Open...

289
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,108
Open... Open.

290
00:29:06,228 --> 00:29:07,320
Open.

291
00:29:07,597 --> 00:29:10,658
Open... open corn!

292
00:29:14,739 --> 00:29:16,036
Open barley!

293
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,576
Open Sesame!

294
00:29:46,977 --> 00:29:48,740
Open Sesame...

295
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,069
that was it.

296
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:52,509
Open Sesame...

297
00:30:10,973 --> 00:30:14,170
Meanwhile, whilst Cassian
was getting himself Killed...

298
00:30:14,376 --> 00:30:18,939
Ali Baba had hired himself
a young serving girl, Morgiana...

299
00:30:19,282 --> 00:30:21,080
to help him now
he had money.

300
00:30:21,285 --> 00:30:23,151
What was this Morgiana like?

301
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:25,255
Some said she was beautiful.

302
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:27,584
But she was certainly clever...
and very independent.

303
00:30:27,794 --> 00:30:29,054
She sounds like you.

304
00:30:29,996 --> 00:30:31,155
Like me?

305
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:35,495
Oh, no, she wasn't like me.
Not like me at all!

306
00:30:37,105 --> 00:30:38,595
That's everything, sir.

307
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:45,008
Saffrow...

308
00:30:47,317 --> 00:30:48,647
where's my brother?

309
00:30:52,023 --> 00:30:53,012
Where's Cassian?

310
00:31:19,535 --> 00:31:21,868
Oh, poor Cassian!

311
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:24,572
I should have tried harder
to stop him.

312
00:31:26,444 --> 00:31:28,879
Don't blame yourself.

313
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:32,616
Come, we should leave
as soon as possible.

314
00:31:33,686 --> 00:31:36,746
No, we must take him with us.

315
00:31:38,491 --> 00:31:39,857
Is that wise?

316
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:41,960
When the robbers come back
and see the body's gone...

317
00:31:42,163 --> 00:31:44,029
they'll know Cassian
had friends or family...

318
00:31:44,566 --> 00:31:46,965
they might try and find you and do
to you what they did to your brother.

319
00:31:47,168 --> 00:31:50,105
I know you're right Morgiana,
but he must have a decent burial.

320
00:31:50,573 --> 00:31:55,442
We can't... we can't leave him for
the vultures to pick on his bones.

321
00:31:55,646 --> 00:31:56,841
He's my brother.

322
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:24,923
Black Coda's men move
through the city.

323
00:34:32,274 --> 00:34:34,742
Robbers find nothing wrong
in robbery...

324
00:34:34,943 --> 00:34:38,778
except when it happens to them.

325
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:21,022
I feel... sad.

326
00:35:21,233 --> 00:35:22,791
But don't you like
your new house?

327
00:35:23,001 --> 00:35:24,263
Of course I do.

328
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:28,440
I just wish Cassian were here
to enjoy it with me... I miss him.

329
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:30,535
It's natural...

330
00:35:30,978 --> 00:35:32,206
he was your brother.

331
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,743
Everyone should
have good fortune...

332
00:35:37,018 --> 00:35:38,509
but it just much better...

333
00:35:39,655 --> 00:35:41,452
if there's someone
to enjoy it with.

334
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:04,014
And so the evil Black Coda
walked up to the city gates...

335
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:09,320
ready to slaughter Ali Baba
and everyone in his house.

336
00:37:12,365 --> 00:37:13,890
What's the matter?

337
00:37:15,034 --> 00:37:16,866
Nothing, Sayid.

338
00:37:18,038 --> 00:37:21,805
What happened to Ali and Morgiana?
What happened next...

339
00:37:22,011 --> 00:37:23,841
and did Black Coda
kill them...

340
00:37:25,613 --> 00:37:27,047
and... don't you know?

341
00:37:27,249 --> 00:37:30,742
Of course I know,
but I'm tired.

342
00:37:31,153 --> 00:37:32,712
It's already morning.

343
00:37:35,192 --> 00:37:38,959
It can't be morning, morning never
comes for me, it's always night.

344
00:37:39,731 --> 00:37:41,723
I've lost track of time.

345
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:47,198
So... you won't go on?

346
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:49,401
Yes...

347
00:37:49,777 --> 00:37:53,009
but storytelling's
best done at night...

348
00:37:53,213 --> 00:37:54,681
at least for me...

349
00:37:54,882 --> 00:37:58,842
I mean, it's hard to create the right
atmosphere with the sun shining...

350
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,325
don't you think?

351
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:21,075
It's a trick!
A trick to trick me!

352
00:38:24,753 --> 00:38:25,742
No!

353
00:38:26,454 --> 00:38:27,443
No!

354
00:38:28,457 --> 00:38:31,450
- What is it, Sayid?
- I want you...

355
00:38:31,661 --> 00:38:34,425
to meet somebody!

356
00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:39,631
Who are these men?

357
00:38:39,837 --> 00:38:41,669
Friends, Sultaness.

358
00:38:43,908 --> 00:38:45,808
Please, stay calm.

359
00:38:46,177 --> 00:38:47,405
Stay back!

360
00:38:47,779 --> 00:38:49,145
Sayid!

361
00:38:51,818 --> 00:38:53,013
Sayid!

362
00:38:54,855 --> 00:38:56,152
Sayid!

363
00:38:57,091 --> 00:38:58,353
No.

364
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:05,431
No.

365
00:39:07,837 --> 00:39:10,568
- Please, stay calm.
- Stay back!

366
00:39:11,342 --> 00:39:12,672
Sayid!

367
00:39:17,181 --> 00:39:18,514
Sayid, no...

368
00:39:27,496 --> 00:39:32,091
You will finish the story
of Ali Baba tomorrow night!

369
00:39:59,499 --> 00:40:01,364
I sit in the bazaar,
telling stories...

370
00:40:01,569 --> 00:40:04,164
but if the audience isn't
interested in what I'm saying...

371
00:40:04,372 --> 00:40:05,362
it walks away.

372
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,170
But if your audience
isn't interested...

373
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,908
you're dead.

374
00:40:13,484 --> 00:40:15,782
I thought it would be easy
but it isn't.

375
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:18,181
I almost lost it before
I got started.

376
00:40:18,389 --> 00:40:21,688
I've told you before,
the first moments are vital.

377
00:40:21,894 --> 00:40:23,520
I paused at a good point...

378
00:40:23,728 --> 00:40:26,630
with the thieves sneaking
into Damascus to kill Ali Baba.

379
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:28,131
Sneaking in how?
In what?

380
00:40:28,335 --> 00:40:30,166
- A wagon.
- Too ordinary...

381
00:40:31,037 --> 00:40:33,131
it has to be something
more exotic...

382
00:40:33,675 --> 00:40:35,505
your starting your story again...

383
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:37,941
you have to hook
your audience again.

384
00:40:39,215 --> 00:40:41,945
- How?
- I was walking last night past...

385
00:40:42,152 --> 00:40:45,020
the Great Mosque
in the street of Sighs...

386
00:40:45,222 --> 00:40:47,712
exactly an hour after sundown...

387
00:40:47,925 --> 00:40:49,917
when I came face to face...

388
00:40:50,362 --> 00:40:51,556
with Death.

389
00:40:54,467 --> 00:40:55,728
Had he come for you?

390
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:58,295
See...

391
00:40:59,806 --> 00:41:01,136
you're hooked!

392
00:41:37,063 --> 00:41:40,932
As I was saying, Black Coda brought
his whole gang into Damascus...

393
00:41:41,135 --> 00:41:43,536
in a wagon,
to murder Ali Baba.

394
00:41:44,806 --> 00:41:46,603
But it was
no ordinary wagon.

395
00:41:54,084 --> 00:41:56,918
The wagon was carrying
an amount of stone jars.

396
00:41:58,623 --> 00:42:00,990
How did Black Coda
explain the jars?

397
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,523
What's this, old man?

398
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:05,823
Forty jars of lamp oil...

399
00:42:06,032 --> 00:42:07,397
for the royal palace.

400
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:10,159
Forty jars of oil...

401
00:42:12,272 --> 00:42:14,832
that's clever...
that's very clever...

402
00:42:15,276 --> 00:42:17,642
obviously Black Coda had
a black heart...

403
00:42:17,847 --> 00:42:19,314
but a very bright brain.

404
00:42:20,649 --> 00:42:22,311
He had that, alright.

405
00:42:24,454 --> 00:42:27,754
Naturally, Ali had no idea
of the danger he was in.

406
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:30,054
He didn't tremble...

407
00:42:30,729 --> 00:42:32,594
when he should have trembled.

408
00:42:40,741 --> 00:42:45,042
How're we going to protect him,
Saffrow? He's a dreamer!

409
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:48,615
What about all those schemes
for making money?

410
00:42:53,255 --> 00:42:55,053
He needs someone
to look after him.

411
00:43:00,931 --> 00:43:03,867
Yeah... I love him...

412
00:43:05,671 --> 00:43:07,001
but does he love me?

413
00:43:10,376 --> 00:43:12,470
Your a camel,
what do you know about love?

414
00:43:15,549 --> 00:43:16,675
I'm sorry...

415
00:43:20,422 --> 00:43:22,050
your a wise camel,
aren't you?

416
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:44,985
There's a wagon parked
in the street outside.

417
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:48,458
It's a merchant, lady,
with jars of oil for the palace...

418
00:44:49,596 --> 00:44:52,895
he asked permission to leave
his wagon there for a few hours.

419
00:44:54,102 --> 00:44:55,933
Did you check him closely?

420
00:44:56,137 --> 00:44:57,126
Yes, lady.

421
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,432
- How much did he give you?
- Nothing, lady, nothing!

422
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:27,602
- Isn't there any more oil in the house?
- We have to buy some tomorrow.

423
00:45:28,609 --> 00:45:30,703
Didn't you say that merchant
had some jars of oil?

424
00:45:30,912 --> 00:45:31,936
Yes.

425
00:45:33,116 --> 00:45:35,208
He won't mind us talking
a little for the night.

426
00:45:35,452 --> 00:45:36,919
We'll pay him
in the morning.

427
00:45:39,022 --> 00:45:41,490
Life often turns on such
small things...

428
00:45:41,691 --> 00:45:43,558
as a flickering oil lamp.

429
00:45:44,996 --> 00:45:48,797
Praise be to Allah... it can't be
long before the killing starts.

430
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:54,237
Morgiana, this man's got
a marvelous idea...

431
00:45:54,441 --> 00:45:56,534
for breeding termites
with wooden legs...

432
00:45:57,177 --> 00:45:59,237
- I think I should invest...
- They've come, Ali!

433
00:45:59,915 --> 00:46:00,904
Who?

434
00:46:01,116 --> 00:46:02,913
The murderers you stole
the money from.

435
00:46:24,342 --> 00:46:25,935
I've got an idea...

436
00:46:27,849 --> 00:46:29,338
follow me.

437
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:49,462
Chief?

438
00:46:50,275 --> 00:46:53,574
Chief, is that you?

439
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,747
Any moment now.

440
00:46:56,616 --> 00:47:00,383
Hear that men?
Any moment now!

441
00:47:00,586 --> 00:47:01,575
Excellent.

442
00:48:24,888 --> 00:48:28,519
The Black Coda's men.

443
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:01,566
Black Coda's men
hung like ripe fruit.

444
00:49:02,334 --> 00:49:04,269
It was all over.

445
00:49:05,304 --> 00:49:06,293
Well. Not quite.

446
00:49:08,442 --> 00:49:10,739
Ali Baba threw
a magnificent party...

447
00:49:10,944 --> 00:49:13,812
to celebrate the defeat
of Black Coda and his gang.

448
00:49:14,015 --> 00:49:15,483
Nostradem!

449
00:49:15,684 --> 00:49:20,646
The chief attraction was the most
famous entertainer in all of Islam.

450
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:22,518
Their jokes enthusiasm the town.

451
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:24,659
It day to celebrate...

452
00:49:24,862 --> 00:49:28,820
because with the help
of my friend, Morgiana...

453
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:32,869
Black Coda's gang have been
crushed like...

454
00:49:33,072 --> 00:49:34,869
beetles.

455
00:49:40,481 --> 00:49:42,972
Ask if Morgiana will dance for us,
Ali Baba...

456
00:49:43,751 --> 00:49:46,277
she's a beautiful dancer!

457
00:49:46,487 --> 00:49:47,513
Morgiana.

458
00:49:47,723 --> 00:49:49,315
I didn't know that, Morgiana.

459
00:49:49,525 --> 00:49:51,617
I can't dance a step.

460
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:54,659
I'll show you.

461
00:50:05,945 --> 00:50:07,206
Morgiana!

462
00:51:19,733 --> 00:51:21,258
That's not funny.

463
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:23,733
Not funny at all.

464
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:29,078
Morgiana,
what have you done?

465
00:51:29,479 --> 00:51:32,937
They all kill!
Women are born to hell!

466
00:51:33,317 --> 00:51:35,307
They kill without reason!

467
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:37,749
She had her reasons.

468
00:51:40,825 --> 00:51:43,454
I... I saw the
tattoo when I offered him wine.

469
00:51:48,869 --> 00:51:51,031
Oh, what would I do
without you?

470
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:10,736
Is that the end
of the story?

471
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:14,772
No, no, no.

472
00:53:16,845 --> 00:53:21,145
Faisal and his wife, Safil...

473
00:53:21,349 --> 00:53:25,048
from Constantinople,
were at Ali Baba's wedding.

474
00:53:25,255 --> 00:53:27,723
Faisal had designed
Morgiana's wedding dress.

475
00:53:28,724 --> 00:53:31,819
He was one of the
best tailors in the East...

476
00:53:32,263 --> 00:53:35,324
but both he and his wife always
looked like they'd been stuffed...

477
00:53:35,534 --> 00:53:38,128
by a good taxidermist.

478
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:41,903
At the wedding...

479
00:53:42,109 --> 00:53:45,703
they met an extraordinary friend
they hadn't seen for years.

480
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:47,570
Who?

481
00:53:52,254 --> 00:53:53,813
A hunchback.

482
00:53:54,023 --> 00:53:57,754
His name was... BacBac.

483
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:01,764
Good name, BacBac.

484
00:54:02,332 --> 00:54:04,062
BacBac liked it too...

485
00:54:04,269 --> 00:54:08,832
in fact, BacBac liked most things
about himself... even his hump...

486
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:13,137
without it, he may not have become
the Sultan's favorite Jester.

487
00:54:13,412 --> 00:54:17,543
I've always supported my family,
they've never wanted for anything...

488
00:54:17,751 --> 00:54:20,778
apart from uncle Abdulah,
he's wanted for bigamy and murder...

489
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:22,588
in that order.

490
00:54:23,859 --> 00:54:26,794
Anyway, back
in Constantinople...

491
00:54:26,996 --> 00:54:29,122
Faisal invited BacBac
to supper...

492
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:31,425
and BacBac never
turned down a free meal.

493
00:54:31,635 --> 00:54:33,295
You know Prince Sinbad?

494
00:54:33,504 --> 00:54:38,601
Oh, he is so ugly even starvation
won't look him in the face!

495
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:41,609
I tell you, I tell you...
no tide would take him out...

496
00:54:41,813 --> 00:54:45,341
when he eats a banana,
he eats it sideways.

497
00:54:46,219 --> 00:54:47,208
And his wife!

498
00:54:47,421 --> 00:54:51,483
Oh! Her face is all dried
and wrinkled like a prune!

499
00:54:52,093 --> 00:54:54,357
She's the sort of woman
you have to look at twice.

500
00:54:54,563 --> 00:54:56,996
The first time,
you don't believe it!

501
00:54:57,365 --> 00:55:00,598
At her wedding,
everyone kissed the groom!

502
00:55:18,391 --> 00:55:20,257
BacBac?

503
00:55:32,275 --> 00:55:36,803
- I think he's dead.
- Dead? He can't be dead.

504
00:55:37,247 --> 00:55:40,911
You're fooling us, aren't you, BacBac?
Another one of your jokes!

505
00:55:41,118 --> 00:55:43,111
He must have suffocated.

506
00:55:43,321 --> 00:55:46,951
Probably a bone, a fish bone
got stuck in his throat.

507
00:55:47,158 --> 00:55:50,994
Poor BacBac. We must tell
the authorities.

508
00:55:51,197 --> 00:55:52,790
They'll blame us.

509
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,969
- It was an accident!
- They'll still blame us...

510
00:55:55,169 --> 00:55:56,601
he was the Sultan's favorite...

511
00:55:56,804 --> 00:56:00,332
"There they go, the people whom
killed poor little BacBac."

512
00:56:00,542 --> 00:56:04,342
- We'll lose all our customers!
- Reputation shattered...

513
00:56:04,546 --> 00:56:07,482
credit destroyed,
income lost.

514
00:56:07,917 --> 00:56:09,316
What're we going to do?

515
00:56:10,222 --> 00:56:13,782
We could take him
to that old physician next door.

516
00:56:13,991 --> 00:56:16,392
It's too late for a physician,
he needs an undertaker.

517
00:56:16,595 --> 00:56:18,460
I mean leave him there...

518
00:56:18,897 --> 00:56:20,661
Let someone else take the blame...

519
00:56:21,935 --> 00:56:23,266
that sounds good!

520
00:56:30,712 --> 00:56:31,805
Calm!

521
00:56:33,248 --> 00:56:34,238
Come on!

522
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:40,780
He is heavy!

523
00:56:46,664 --> 00:56:48,360
- We'll leave him here.
- Good.

524
00:56:50,403 --> 00:56:51,835
Come on.

525
00:56:53,171 --> 00:56:54,196
Who's that?

526
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:59,938
- Can I help you?
- We came to see Dr. Ezra...

527
00:57:00,148 --> 00:57:02,343
for our friend,
if it's not too late.

528
00:57:09,526 --> 00:57:12,963
It's never too late
with Dr. Ezra.

529
00:57:13,832 --> 00:57:15,491
- You wanna bet?
- I'll get him...

530
00:57:16,968 --> 00:57:19,630
your friend doesn't look
too good.

531
00:57:19,904 --> 00:57:21,964
Let's go.

532
00:57:23,075 --> 00:57:24,407
Come on, hurry.

533
00:57:24,678 --> 00:57:27,112
Ezra, we have a customer.

534
00:57:27,314 --> 00:57:31,718
- Another penniless vagrant?
- No, he's paid...

535
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:33,416
he's outside on the landing.

536
00:57:33,622 --> 00:57:36,590
Show him to me, my dear,
before he gets away!

537
00:57:39,828 --> 00:57:42,661
He's waiting on the stairs.
Be careful...

538
00:57:42,864 --> 00:57:45,061
I can't see where he...

539
00:57:46,704 --> 00:57:52,768
Ezra... Ezra,
Ezra, speak to me!

540
00:57:53,378 --> 00:57:57,214
You must wear your
glasses, Ezra...

541
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:00,075
how do you feel?

542
00:58:00,284 --> 00:58:03,279
- I don't know.
- You don't know, you're a physician!

543
00:58:03,489 --> 00:58:05,252
So I'm a physician...

544
00:58:05,457 --> 00:58:07,858
so what else you want you
should tell me?

545
00:58:08,063 --> 00:58:10,997
Sir... your friends said
you don't feel very well.

546
00:58:11,198 --> 00:58:12,893
I'm sure my husband
can help you...

547
00:58:13,101 --> 00:58:15,729
- No, he can't.
- Of course you can.

548
00:58:15,937 --> 00:58:18,600
No, I don't think so.

549
00:58:18,808 --> 00:58:20,969
He's dead.

550
00:58:22,979 --> 00:58:25,881
- The fall down the stairs!
- A terrible accident!

551
00:58:26,083 --> 00:58:27,607
It's worse than that.

552
00:58:27,819 --> 00:58:30,755
He comes here for medical
treatment and he ends up dead!

553
00:58:30,956 --> 00:58:34,255
What will this do to
your reputation, Ezra?

554
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:38,064
He looks familiar.

555
00:58:38,565 --> 00:58:40,192
The Sultan's Jester!

556
00:58:40,401 --> 00:58:43,734
Alas, poor BacBac.

557
00:58:43,938 --> 00:58:46,430
- I knew him well.
- We're doomed!

558
00:58:46,641 --> 00:58:49,803
We'll be blamed...
we're foreigners!

559
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:53,380
Help me carry him upstairs...
hurry!

560
00:58:53,584 --> 00:58:57,247
It's amazing how quickly people
can improvise when they have to...

561
00:58:57,454 --> 00:58:59,751
the Ezra's had to
take a gamble...

562
00:58:59,958 --> 00:59:03,292
forgetting that gambling
is only a way of getting nothing...

563
00:59:03,495 --> 00:59:05,896
for something.

564
00:59:08,335 --> 00:59:12,635
There's nothing worse than being
alone in a strange city.

565
00:59:18,479 --> 00:59:22,644
Lift his arms up,
so he'll slide down easier.

566
00:59:25,221 --> 00:59:27,451
It's as if he doesn't like
what we're doing.

567
00:59:27,657 --> 00:59:30,491
Nonsense!
He'd see the funny side of it.

568
00:59:35,167 --> 00:59:37,864
Oh, Buddha, show me a sign...

569
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:40,664
say I'm not forsaken in
a foreign land...

570
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:54,521
Robbers! Thieves!

571
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:00,452
My hands are lethal!

572
01:00:05,937 --> 01:00:07,336
Dead.

573
01:00:07,538 --> 01:00:10,906
I told you about my hands!

574
01:00:15,048 --> 01:00:16,381
I know you...

575
01:00:16,584 --> 01:00:21,146
the famous BacBac...
the Sultan's Jester...

576
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:28,018
Why did you come down
my chimney?

577
01:00:28,396 --> 01:00:31,367
It's a joke to set
the whole town laughing...

578
01:00:31,568 --> 01:00:34,730
well, the laugh's on you,
Jester BacBac...

579
01:00:34,938 --> 01:00:37,373
no, the laugh's on me...

580
01:00:38,276 --> 01:00:42,179
they'll say I murdered you...
I'll be hanged...

581
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,449
Think of something, Hi-Ching,
think of something...

582
01:01:29,004 --> 01:01:31,029
Murder! I'm being attacked!

583
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:33,902
You'll get no money from me!

584
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:37,546
You'll get not a penny from me...

585
01:01:39,617 --> 01:01:42,677
Guards, guards, seize this man...

586
01:01:42,887 --> 01:01:45,824
he just tried to kill me!

587
01:01:46,324 --> 01:01:50,422
- Instead, you killed him.
- I... I did... splendid!

588
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:51,994
You're drunk.

589
01:01:52,198 --> 01:01:53,928
- This is BacBac...
- Drunk?

590
01:01:54,134 --> 01:01:55,659
The Sultan's Jester.

591
01:01:55,870 --> 01:01:58,804
- BacBac?
- And you killed him.

592
01:01:59,006 --> 01:02:02,966
Why should I kill him,
we haven't even been introduced?

593
01:02:03,412 --> 01:02:05,847
That is for a judge to decide.

594
01:02:06,048 --> 01:02:09,745
And when he has,
we'll hang you!

595
01:02:12,222 --> 01:02:16,250
The trial of Jerome Gribbin
was the social event of the season.

596
01:02:16,461 --> 01:02:20,125
The judge in the case
was the venerable Judge Zadic.

597
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:23,729
Judge Zadic was totally
incompetent...

598
01:02:23,937 --> 01:02:26,929
but being a judge,
nobody had noticed.

599
01:02:27,776 --> 01:02:31,404
...which I suggest is death,
death by hanging.

600
01:02:36,284 --> 01:02:38,082
Why did you kill him?

601
01:02:38,454 --> 01:02:40,320
I thought he was trying
to rob me.

602
01:02:44,829 --> 01:02:47,025
BacBac rob you?

603
01:02:48,066 --> 01:02:50,796
Forty years administring
justice...

604
01:02:51,103 --> 01:02:53,571
worst excuse I ever heard!

605
01:02:53,772 --> 01:02:56,675
- I made a mistake.
- You certainly did...

606
01:02:56,878 --> 01:02:59,573
all Constantinople will miss
poor BacBac...

607
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:02,216
we will never see the like
of him again...

608
01:03:02,418 --> 01:03:04,511
A fellow of infinite jest...

609
01:03:05,453 --> 01:03:08,184
"infinite jest",
that's a good one...

610
01:03:09,193 --> 01:03:11,661
write that down, clerk,
before I forget it.

611
01:03:13,563 --> 01:03:15,998
BacBac lightened our lives...

612
01:03:16,199 --> 01:03:18,259
he gave us laughter,
rich and overflowing...

613
01:03:18,469 --> 01:03:22,304
laughter from the heart.
A heart as big as he was small...

614
01:03:23,708 --> 01:03:27,110
we knew him, we loved him...

615
01:03:28,081 --> 01:03:29,743
we laughed with him...

616
01:03:30,484 --> 01:03:32,884
we'll remember him
all our days.

617
01:03:37,658 --> 01:03:41,061
I sentence you to hang.

618
01:03:43,299 --> 01:03:47,760
Assassin!

619
01:03:47,972 --> 01:03:50,770
No, no, please, no!

620
01:03:54,512 --> 01:03:57,505
- No, no, please! No!
- Who is this Chinese person?

621
01:03:57,716 --> 01:04:00,845
I killed the poor hunchback.
I stuffed him in the alcove.

622
01:04:01,054 --> 01:04:03,182
No! No!

623
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:07,157
I killed poor BacBac, and dropped
him down Hi-Ching's chimney.

624
01:04:07,361 --> 01:04:09,991
No! I killed poor BacBac.

625
01:04:10,498 --> 01:04:11,933
- I don't understand...
- I killed him...

626
01:04:12,134 --> 01:04:15,070
...my hands are lethal!
- I tripped over him in the dark!

627
01:04:15,272 --> 01:04:18,069
He's very short-sighted.
You can't hang a man for that!

628
01:04:18,275 --> 01:04:19,709
It was a fishbone!

629
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:22,310
I'm still the best tailor
in Constantinople!

630
01:04:22,513 --> 01:04:25,973
- My head's splitting...
- Order in the Court! Order! Order!

631
01:04:26,185 --> 01:04:27,674
I'll have a lamb shish-kebab!

632
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:35,389
Your Majesty.

633
01:04:36,697 --> 01:04:39,894
Who killed my funny
man Jester BacBac?

634
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:43,170
I did!

635
01:04:48,746 --> 01:04:51,044
Who do I hang, Sayiddi?

636
01:04:52,918 --> 01:04:54,146
Nobody.

637
01:04:55,019 --> 01:04:56,248
It was an accident!

638
01:04:57,322 --> 01:05:00,485
Besides being my Jester,
Master BacBac was my friend...

639
01:05:00,692 --> 01:05:02,855
and if I knew him right
he would've appreciated...

640
01:05:03,062 --> 01:05:06,191
the manner of his death,
it was his final jest...

641
01:05:07,535 --> 01:05:10,698
dear BacBac didn't have
to be alive to be funny...

642
01:05:10,905 --> 01:05:12,840
even dead, he made us laugh!

643
01:08:19,189 --> 01:08:21,714
As the crowd were
leaving the courtroom...

644
01:08:21,926 --> 01:08:25,454
the most famous magician
in Africa, Mustappa...

645
01:08:25,664 --> 01:08:28,292
passed by on his
way to Samarkand.

646
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:32,061
He was a charismatic man with
piercing eyes a seductive voice...

647
01:08:32,272 --> 01:08:35,107
and a manner that would freeze
friends at twenty paces.

648
01:08:35,909 --> 01:08:39,242
But he came into a room
the mice jumped on chairs...

649
01:08:40,081 --> 01:08:42,380
but he isn't the hero
of this story.

650
01:08:42,717 --> 01:08:43,741
Who is then?

651
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:45,617
Eh... Sinbad...

652
01:08:49,592 --> 01:08:50,582
Aladdin.

653
01:08:50,794 --> 01:08:51,783
No!

654
01:09:12,754 --> 01:09:14,051
Cheat.
It's all a cheat.

655
01:09:16,391 --> 01:09:17,654
That race was fixed!

656
01:09:17,859 --> 01:09:20,021
No question...
anyone could see that, Aladdin!

657
01:09:20,230 --> 01:09:21,992
Honest men like us go for
a day at the races...

658
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:23,631
and get cheated blind out
of our hard earned money.

659
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:27,292
- It just shows honesty doesn't pay.
- Let's get back to work.

660
01:09:29,908 --> 01:09:31,102
Sorry, excuse me.

661
01:09:31,777 --> 01:09:34,245
My purse!
I've been robbed!

662
01:09:35,114 --> 01:09:36,743
- What's the matter, sir?
- That young rogue...

663
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:39,248
the one who bumped
into me picked my pocket!

664
01:09:39,653 --> 01:09:41,713
I saw which way he went.
This way follow me!

665
01:09:42,557 --> 01:09:44,024
Stop thief!

666
01:10:03,248 --> 01:10:04,716
Who's in the coach?

667
01:10:07,053 --> 01:10:08,350
Let's find out.

668
01:10:28,612 --> 01:10:29,637
Who's that?

669
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:32,672
Princess Zobeide,
the Caliph's daughter.

670
01:10:32,884 --> 01:10:35,410
- Come on. Let's get out of here.
- I'm in love!

671
01:10:42,797 --> 01:10:44,389
Come on!

672
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:48,396
There they are.

673
01:11:31,121 --> 01:11:32,486
Where did you come from?

674
01:11:32,690 --> 01:11:35,625
From the other side
of the world. Africa.

675
01:11:35,826 --> 01:11:38,694
- What do you want with me?
- Stay calm, Aladdin...

676
01:11:38,898 --> 01:11:40,888
do I look like I'm with
the Caliph's guards?

677
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:43,534
I'm always calm.
How do you know my name?

678
01:11:43,736 --> 01:11:48,333
- I was a friend of your late father.
- I didn't know he had any friends.

679
01:11:48,542 --> 01:11:50,841
Oh, very few... just me.

680
01:11:51,411 --> 01:11:53,812
Your father was so crooked...

681
01:11:54,015 --> 01:11:56,883
he could hide in the
shadow of a corkscrew.

682
01:11:57,620 --> 01:11:58,882
You did know him!

683
01:12:00,524 --> 01:12:04,254
- Do you want to become rich?
- Yes, but quick!

684
01:12:04,461 --> 01:12:05,860
It's the best way.

685
01:12:06,564 --> 01:12:08,794
Business? Shady business?

686
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,096
Shady... shifty... shadowy...

687
01:12:12,305 --> 01:12:13,634
but profitable.

688
01:12:13,838 --> 01:12:14,965
What do I have to do?

689
01:12:16,509 --> 01:12:19,946
First of all, I have
to check your suitability...

690
01:12:20,681 --> 01:12:21,705
Good.

691
01:12:22,450 --> 01:12:25,248
Meet me tomorrow outside
the city gates at dawn.

692
01:12:26,221 --> 01:12:29,454
Here's a small token
of my good faith.

693
01:13:46,251 --> 01:13:49,015
And so Aladdin and Mustappa
left Samarkand.

694
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:53,783
He didn't trust Mustappa, but
when there was money involved...

695
01:13:54,093 --> 01:13:56,790
Aladdin was prepared
to take a few risks...

696
01:13:56,997 --> 01:13:59,124
I don't want to boast,
but I've never met anyone...

697
01:13:59,333 --> 01:14:02,895
who can live with me in a
straight fight, magic to magic...

698
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:05,298
So what do want me for
if you're so powerful?

699
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:07,638
All power has its limits...

700
01:14:08,078 --> 01:14:11,377
I want you to retrieve
an object for me...

701
01:14:11,681 --> 01:14:15,812
I can't get it myself, for reasons
too complicated to get into...

702
01:14:16,019 --> 01:14:17,715
its to do with
the rules of magic...

703
01:14:17,923 --> 01:14:20,415
they're tiresome,
but they must be obeyed.

704
01:14:20,627 --> 01:14:21,615
Why pick me?

705
01:14:22,193 --> 01:14:23,958
You didn't believe I was
a friend of your father's?

706
01:14:24,162 --> 01:14:26,792
Not for a moment...
so, why me?

707
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:29,566
I saw larceny in your soul.

708
01:14:31,038 --> 01:14:32,438
What do you want me to do?

709
01:14:32,841 --> 01:14:34,900
I want you to go into a tomb...

710
01:14:35,142 --> 01:14:37,908
You'll find an old lamp there.
I want you to bring it to me.

711
01:14:38,247 --> 01:14:39,406
What tomb?

712
01:14:42,351 --> 01:14:43,943
- There.
- How much?

713
01:14:44,154 --> 01:14:47,282
- We'll discuss that when you get back.
- No, we discuss it now, or I don't go.

714
01:14:47,992 --> 01:14:49,856
Fifty gold pieces.

715
01:14:50,062 --> 01:14:51,460
Please, don't insult me...

716
01:14:51,664 --> 01:14:54,155
and don't ask me to trust you.
I don't even trust my own shadow.

717
01:14:54,433 --> 01:14:55,559
Two hundred!

718
01:14:55,868 --> 01:14:56,892
Done!

719
01:14:57,404 --> 01:14:58,563
Here's half.

720
01:14:59,072 --> 01:15:01,939
You gave it to easily.
I should have asked for more.

721
01:15:02,075 --> 01:15:05,046
You do so remind me of me
when I was young!

722
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:08,647
Here now take this ring...

723
01:15:08,850 --> 01:15:11,149
rub it if you get into
any kind of trouble.

724
01:15:11,887 --> 01:15:13,788
Trouble?
What sort of trouble?

725
01:15:14,089 --> 01:15:15,752
Two hundred is not enough!

726
01:15:15,993 --> 01:15:19,224
A deal is a deal!
Don't try and betray me...

727
01:15:19,463 --> 01:15:22,955
if you do, I swear
by Hector's feathers...

728
01:15:23,167 --> 01:15:24,830
you'll never see
your wedding day.

729
01:15:25,036 --> 01:15:26,025
Who's Hector?

730
01:15:26,238 --> 01:15:28,433
My pet raven and
my best friend.

731
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:56,565
Aladdin didn't Know what Kind
of trouble he was getting into...

732
01:15:56,842 --> 01:15:59,641
if he had, he wouldn't
have taken the two hundred...

733
01:16:02,148 --> 01:16:04,583
on the other hand,
he probably would...

734
01:16:06,554 --> 01:16:08,145
Go on... go on!

735
01:19:58,199 --> 01:19:59,861
Aladdin, have you got
the lamp?

736
01:20:02,772 --> 01:20:05,571
Hand it up to me... it'll be
easier for you to get out.

737
01:20:05,775 --> 01:20:09,678
- It's no trouble, I can get up myself.
- Pass it up to me... there's a good boy.

738
01:20:09,881 --> 01:20:11,110
I'm not a good boy!

739
01:20:11,516 --> 01:20:13,883
Give it to me or
you'll make me very angry.

740
01:20:14,086 --> 01:20:15,110
I'm angry already!

741
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:17,481
Do you think I'm gullible enough
to fall for that old trick?

742
01:20:17,823 --> 01:20:20,759
You ride off with the lamp,
without paying me what you owe me!

743
01:20:21,162 --> 01:20:23,356
It's an insult to my
professional integrity.

744
01:20:23,564 --> 01:20:25,726
You get your lamp
when I get my gold!

745
01:20:26,468 --> 01:20:29,301
- You think I'd ride off?
- Yes! You've got those shifty eyes!

746
01:20:29,503 --> 01:20:32,167
You cheap street scum!

747
01:20:32,375 --> 01:20:34,138
I resent the word "cheap".

748
01:20:34,744 --> 01:20:36,474
I was going to raise you up...

749
01:20:36,713 --> 01:20:38,682
now I cast you down!

750
01:20:38,882 --> 01:20:41,283
You want the lamp?
Keep it, damn you!

751
01:20:46,858 --> 01:20:47,918
Damn you!

752
01:21:46,928 --> 01:21:48,454
This was a crisis.

753
01:21:48,665 --> 01:21:51,896
And in a crisis, there's nothing
more effective than magic...

754
01:21:57,910 --> 01:21:58,933
Who're you?

755
01:22:00,881 --> 01:22:04,544
Omar Khayyan! I'm the Genie
of the Ring, who else?

756
01:22:04,751 --> 01:22:05,740
Look...

757
01:22:06,820 --> 01:22:08,720
Stamp of authenticity!

758
01:22:09,490 --> 01:22:11,789
But before I answer
anymore questions...

759
01:22:11,994 --> 01:22:13,551
what color was my smoke?

760
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:18,930
Was it blue? If it was blue, it means
that I am melancholy and sanguine.

761
01:22:19,402 --> 01:22:21,632
That means that I need
more "me" time.

762
01:22:23,007 --> 01:22:26,671
What do you want.
I have enemies, I have a migraine...

763
01:22:26,878 --> 01:22:28,004
What do you think I want...

764
01:22:29,882 --> 01:22:31,109
I want out!

765
01:22:31,316 --> 01:22:35,946
I always about you,
never about me.

766
01:22:36,189 --> 01:22:37,851
Get me out of here,
take me home...

767
01:22:38,057 --> 01:22:40,026
put me out, I'm on fire.

768
01:22:44,465 --> 01:22:48,526
Allah! Allah! We're going to die!
I don't want to die!

769
01:22:48,737 --> 01:22:49,897
Come on, pull yourself together!

770
01:22:50,105 --> 01:22:53,405
Please spare me, I'm only seven
hundred and nineteen years old!

771
01:22:53,709 --> 01:22:57,044
I was going to repent,
I was going on a diet, oh, please...

772
01:22:57,248 --> 01:22:58,271
Get us out of here!

773
01:22:58,883 --> 01:23:01,682
Have you ever heard
of the magic word please?

774
01:23:02,554 --> 01:23:04,454
Because I work for you
doesn't mean you...

775
01:23:04,656 --> 01:23:09,856
can treat me like some sort of
manslave or a eunuch or less than that!

776
01:23:10,631 --> 01:23:11,996
Are we understood?

777
01:23:17,772 --> 01:23:20,798
The light! The light!
I cannot see!

778
01:23:21,010 --> 01:23:23,878
I am blind! It's too bright!

779
01:23:24,581 --> 01:23:28,712
My body is aching!
I shall go home.

780
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,649
Salaam.

781
01:23:38,365 --> 01:23:40,732
I don't understand.

782
01:23:41,602 --> 01:23:44,537
Why would Mustappa pick
the best rogue in all Samarkand...

783
01:23:44,738 --> 01:23:46,901
to get this piece of junk?

784
01:23:47,108 --> 01:23:49,236
- It's demeaning!
- It must be worth something...

785
01:23:49,478 --> 01:23:52,209
or he wouldn't have gone
to all the trouble.

786
01:23:55,753 --> 01:24:01,020
You're right, son.
Maybe it's a priceless antique.

787
01:25:14,046 --> 01:25:17,210
Don't just stand there
like a leaning tower of jelly!

788
01:25:17,717 --> 01:25:19,618
- Talk to him!
- Why me?

789
01:25:19,854 --> 01:25:22,448
I'm just a poor,
weak widow-woman!

790
01:25:22,656 --> 01:25:24,089
It's your lamp!

791
01:25:25,127 --> 01:25:26,959
Good evening.

792
01:25:27,996 --> 01:25:29,828
- Friend?
- Speak up...

793
01:25:30,099 --> 01:25:35,332
insignificant mortal lowly one!

794
01:25:35,873 --> 01:25:39,274
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

795
01:25:39,643 --> 01:25:42,375
Who am I?

796
01:25:42,681 --> 01:25:45,774
Have you not heard of me?

797
01:25:46,218 --> 01:25:49,746
I am the Lamp Genie!

798
01:25:50,122 --> 01:25:53,355
The Lamp Genie!

799
01:25:53,594 --> 01:25:58,430
Wishes, avarice, dreams, power...

800
01:25:58,633 --> 01:26:02,263
premature and violent death...

801
01:26:03,106 --> 01:26:06,769
Well, scratch the last one.

802
01:26:06,976 --> 01:26:09,036
You're like the Genie of the Ring?

803
01:26:09,580 --> 01:26:13,073
Like the Genie of the Ring?

804
01:26:13,919 --> 01:26:18,619
I who oppose the will of Heaven?

805
01:26:18,858 --> 01:26:20,621
Never!

806
01:26:20,827 --> 01:26:23,695
His powers are as nothing...

807
01:26:23,897 --> 01:26:26,765
as compared to mine!

808
01:26:28,102 --> 01:26:31,402
- Are you two related?
- No.

809
01:26:32,308 --> 01:26:37,838
Well, maybe. I don't know.
The tests were inconclusive.

810
01:26:38,215 --> 01:26:42,778
- What can you do?
- What can I do?

811
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:48,158
What can I do?
I don't know.

812
01:26:48,527 --> 01:26:50,929
How about anything...

813
01:26:51,630 --> 01:26:53,862
for starters?

814
01:26:57,071 --> 01:26:59,040
And that was the beginning of it.

815
01:27:01,209 --> 01:27:05,340
Aladdin, a rogue, a son of a rogue,
from a family of rogues...

816
01:27:05,548 --> 01:27:08,312
found he could have
everything he ever wanted.

817
01:27:08,518 --> 01:27:11,852
All he had to do was ask.

818
01:27:15,493 --> 01:27:17,894
So? So?

819
01:27:18,397 --> 01:27:20,422
So what did he ask for?

820
01:27:20,633 --> 01:27:25,333
- We can save that for tomorrow night.
- I want to know now!

821
01:27:25,539 --> 01:27:28,771
Not tomorrow night!
It's your fault!

822
01:27:29,610 --> 01:27:32,443
You made the story so gripping
with your wit and your charm and...

823
01:27:32,648 --> 01:27:34,878
and your beauty.

824
01:27:35,084 --> 01:27:36,778
What's my beauty got to do
with story-telling?

825
01:27:36,984 --> 01:27:40,319
Because I lose interest for a moment,
I see your face and I can't leave.

826
01:27:40,524 --> 01:27:42,514
Please tell me
what happened to Aladdin.

827
01:27:42,826 --> 01:27:46,227
- Sayid... tomorrow night.
- I order you!

828
01:27:46,431 --> 01:27:48,899
It wouldn't be the same story
if I was ordered to tell it.

829
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:50,533
- It's all tricks!
- Remember what happened...

830
01:27:50,736 --> 01:27:53,204
to Mustappa when
he lost his temper.

831
01:27:53,406 --> 01:27:55,704
- He lost his wonderful lamp.
- Tell me!

832
01:27:55,909 --> 01:27:57,843
Tomorrow night!

833
01:28:00,247 --> 01:28:02,683
Chief, now!

834
01:28:09,658 --> 01:28:12,151
Just wait till tomorrow night.

835
01:28:12,562 --> 01:28:14,552
Tomorrow night.

836
01:28:14,898 --> 01:28:17,094
Tomorrow night.

837
01:30:30,837 --> 01:30:35,866
- But he wasn't laughing, was he?
- No that's right. He wasn't.

838
01:30:36,911 --> 01:30:41,143
I let you live so you could
finish the story of Aladdin...

839
01:30:41,417 --> 01:30:43,579
you should at least get it right.

840
01:30:46,723 --> 01:30:47,917
Now...

841
01:30:48,826 --> 01:30:50,589
there was a storm,
wasn't there?

842
01:30:52,462 --> 01:30:54,591
Yes, there was...

843
01:30:58,671 --> 01:30:59,399
You were saying?

844
01:30:59,605 --> 01:31:02,006
I am your humble and
obedient servant.

845
01:31:02,207 --> 01:31:03,334
What? I didn't get that!

846
01:31:03,543 --> 01:31:06,809
Oh, nothing,
just a mere technicality...

847
01:31:07,013 --> 01:31:12,282
the fine print on my contract,
so to speak.

848
01:31:12,887 --> 01:31:16,881
- You have to obey me, don't you?
- I, obey you?

849
01:31:17,628 --> 01:31:22,065
I should cast you
into a sea of torment...

850
01:31:22,267 --> 01:31:24,701
I should have you trampled in...

851
01:31:25,837 --> 01:31:30,673
yes, you can have anything
you ever wanted.

852
01:31:31,953 --> 01:31:33,541
How about stopping the rain?

853
01:32:03,286 --> 01:32:06,737
I'm sure there must be another...

854
01:32:06,948 --> 01:32:11,604
wish I can grant your exalted Lord
and Master Aladdin...

855
01:32:11,811 --> 01:32:14,467
I'm in love with
the Princess Zobeide...

856
01:32:14,673 --> 01:32:17,137
...the Caliph's daughter...
- Love?

857
01:32:17,338 --> 01:32:19,529
I don't know her, but I've seen
her across a crowded street...

858
01:32:19,736 --> 01:32:24,356
It's usually across a crowded room,
as strange as that may seem.

859
01:32:25,263 --> 01:32:29,554
- I want her!
- I can give you things, Master Aladdin...

860
01:32:29,757 --> 01:32:32,845
but when it comes to the human
heart, I am powerless.

861
01:32:33,055 --> 01:32:34,712
You can have anything
in the world...

862
01:32:34,919 --> 01:32:37,314
you want and all you
can think of asking for...

863
01:32:37,517 --> 01:32:41,070
is for some young chit of a girl
who isn't good enough for you!

864
01:32:41,278 --> 01:32:47,569
- Genie, you can give us things?
- You've got it in one, Mother.

865
01:32:47,772 --> 01:32:51,723
Not so much of the "Mother". I'm young
enough to be your granddaughter.

866
01:32:52,001 --> 01:32:56,690
- Things, like money...
- I've never heard that request before.

867
01:32:56,895 --> 01:32:59,324
You would be the first
to ever ask for that.

868
01:32:59,792 --> 01:33:01,653
Bushels and bushels of money!

869
01:33:01,858 --> 01:33:03,651
With money,
you don't need magic!

870
01:33:03,855 --> 01:33:07,511
Are you sure that's
the way you want to go?

871
01:33:07,718 --> 01:33:11,839
I mean, money is great and all,
but everybody asks for money.

872
01:33:12,046 --> 01:33:14,976
Why not ask for something
new and exciting?

873
01:33:16,009 --> 01:33:17,973
Okay, how about some
sort of flying machine?

874
01:33:18,174 --> 01:33:19,161
What?

875
01:33:19,739 --> 01:33:22,224
A flying machine?

876
01:33:22,702 --> 01:33:27,560
So you could fly all over the world?
You could have drinks...

877
01:33:27,763 --> 01:33:29,852
and someone
could serve us peanuts!

878
01:33:30,993 --> 01:33:35,977
A flying machine! Maybe we should
just stick with the money.

879
01:34:02,992 --> 01:34:08,612
Make way for the lovely
Princess Seleh Alcouz of Souman...

880
01:34:08,853 --> 01:34:10,783
Aladdin's mother put
on an extraordinarily...

881
01:34:10,984 --> 01:34:13,379
vulgar display of wealth...

882
01:34:16,344 --> 01:34:19,172
but as usual, it worked.

883
01:34:21,239 --> 01:34:24,929
We have more petitions,
Your Majesty, they're important.

884
01:34:25,135 --> 01:34:26,963
Your son Gulnare
doesn't think so.

885
01:34:28,431 --> 01:34:30,158
Wake up.
