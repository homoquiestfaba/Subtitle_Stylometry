00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:04,986
(dark atmospheric music)

2
00:00:06,827 --> 00:00:09,744
(foreboding music)

3
00:00:23,605 --> 00:00:25,056
♪ The bride feeds the groom ♪

4
00:00:25,056 --> 00:00:27,451
♪ The bride feeds the groom ♪

5
00:00:27,451 --> 00:00:29,312
♪ Hi-ho, the derry-o ♪

6
00:00:29,312 --> 00:00:31,318
♪ The bride feeds the groom ♪

7
00:00:31,318 --> 00:00:32,537
(guests applauding)

8
00:00:32,537 --> 00:00:33,998
- Nice.

9
00:00:33,998 --> 00:00:35,165
Very nice day.

10
00:00:38,014 --> 00:00:39,826
That's very nice cake.

11
00:00:39,826 --> 00:00:42,486
Hold the cake for a second.

12
00:00:42,486 --> 00:00:44,041
Cut, cut.

13
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:47,041
(soft somber music)

14
00:00:59,346 --> 00:01:01,870
(clearing throat)

15
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:06,173
- Mama, still the most
beautiful woman I've ever met.

16
00:01:06,173 --> 00:01:07,755
Come here.
- Ooh, really.

17
00:01:07,755 --> 00:01:09,584
(lips smacking)

18
00:01:09,584 --> 00:01:11,530
You don't think the earrings are too much?

19
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,750
- Never.

20
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,583
Come here.

21
00:01:26,207 --> 00:01:27,148
Remember Michael?

22
00:01:27,148 --> 00:01:29,276
- [Madeline] Oh yes, my other son.

23
00:01:29,276 --> 00:01:31,967
The one who wants to save the homeless.

24
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:33,426
- Happy birthday, mother.

25
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,050
- Give us your smelly masses.

26
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,375
Where's my cake?

27
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:40,915
Is this a birthday party or a funeral?

28
00:01:40,915 --> 00:01:42,915
What, no male strippers?

29
00:01:49,188 --> 00:01:50,105
- You okay?

30
00:01:52,082 --> 00:01:54,082
- I shouldn't have come.

31
00:01:55,011 --> 00:01:58,357
- I'm proud of you for
facing the old bird.

32
00:01:58,357 --> 00:02:01,190
(Michael sighing)

33
00:02:07,824 --> 00:02:12,146
- Before you father when Frank
Sinatra and I were an item,

34
00:02:12,146 --> 00:02:16,270
we would go to the soda
fountain for an egg cream.

35
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,853
I spent my 23rd birthday there.

36
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:21,306
What a man.

37
00:02:22,193 --> 00:02:24,193
I should've married him.

38
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,353
Your grandmother was
major babeage, young man.

39
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,457
I was gorgeous.
- You still are, mama.

40
00:02:42,777 --> 00:02:44,047
- Why don't you blow
out the candles mother,

41
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:45,964
so we can cut the cake?

42
00:02:47,621 --> 00:02:51,371
- Okay party pooper. (blows)

43
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:56,819
(guests applauding)

44
00:03:01,304 --> 00:03:04,109
- Hey.
- Hi baby, sorry I'm late.

45
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:05,109
- It's okay.

46
00:03:06,776 --> 00:03:08,222
- I was showing a house.

47
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:09,615
- How'd it go?
- Good.

48
00:03:09,615 --> 00:03:10,521
- Great.

49
00:03:10,521 --> 00:03:11,688
Here, come on.

50
00:03:22,094 --> 00:03:23,957
- Hi, happy birthday.

51
00:03:23,957 --> 00:03:25,707
- Thank you, darling.

52
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:28,674
- Hey, how are you?

53
00:03:28,674 --> 00:03:29,752
Hi, I'm Bernadette.

54
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:31,215
- I'm Michael.

55
00:03:31,215 --> 00:03:32,100
- Nice to meet you, Michael.

56
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:32,956
Hi.
- Hi, I'm Annie.

57
00:03:32,956 --> 00:03:34,277
- Nice to meet you.

58
00:03:34,277 --> 00:03:35,585
- This is my brother.

59
00:03:35,585 --> 00:03:39,588
- Ooh, you guys have
such an amazing house.

60
00:03:39,588 --> 00:03:41,745
- I'm very happy with my house, thank you.

61
00:03:41,745 --> 00:03:43,412
It's very welcoming.

62
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:55,001
- That is my grandson there.

63
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:58,278
I almost didn't recognize you.

64
00:03:58,278 --> 00:03:59,188
- Happy birthday.

65
00:03:59,188 --> 00:04:01,139
- Thank you for inviting us.

66
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:03,056
- Ah, did I invite you?

67
00:04:04,585 --> 00:04:06,363
That Marilyn Monroe--
- Let's go.

68
00:04:06,363 --> 00:04:08,374
- Good night.
- Never wearing any pants.

69
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:12,316
That's why I stopped, she
said it breaks up the line.

70
00:04:12,316 --> 00:04:13,233
There, see?

71
00:04:15,115 --> 00:04:17,365
Fancies mess up everything.

72
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,882
- With the winds from
the south at 17 miles...

73
00:04:31,882 --> 00:04:33,822
(tires screeching)

74
00:04:33,822 --> 00:04:35,155
- [Man] Get him!

75
00:04:36,545 --> 00:04:37,730
- The hell what was that?

76
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:38,563
Whoa!

77
00:04:38,563 --> 00:04:41,730
(intense chase music)

78
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,713
Hey!

79
00:05:01,225 --> 00:05:03,325
- C'mon, get up!

80
00:05:03,325 --> 00:05:05,830
- Let's go.
- Get him up.

81
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,816
(muffled crosstalk)

82
00:05:07,816 --> 00:05:11,983
(fist thudding)
(Jesse shouting)

83
00:05:13,014 --> 00:05:15,781
(muffled crosstalk)

84
00:05:15,781 --> 00:05:17,111
- Hey, hey!

85
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:18,567
What the fuck?

86
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:19,900
Sons of bitches!

87
00:05:21,045 --> 00:05:22,496
Hey kid, you okay?

88
00:05:22,496 --> 00:05:23,904
Hey hey hey, don't worry kid.

89
00:05:23,904 --> 00:05:26,205
Hey, c'mon c'mon, don't try to move.

90
00:05:26,205 --> 00:05:27,444
What happened?

91
00:05:27,444 --> 00:05:28,368
What's your name?

92
00:05:28,368 --> 00:05:29,780
Jesse?
- Jesse.

93
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,013
- Jesse, you're gonna be alright, okay?

94
00:05:32,013 --> 00:05:33,621
You're gonna be alright.

95
00:05:33,621 --> 00:05:35,203
Listen, cops are coming now.

96
00:05:35,203 --> 00:05:36,197
You're gonna be okay.

97
00:05:36,197 --> 00:05:37,833
- No cops.
- No, don't try to move.

98
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:38,895
What're you doin'?

99
00:05:38,895 --> 00:05:40,257
No no no, don't go anywhere.

100
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,268
Look, c'mon man.

101
00:05:41,268 --> 00:05:42,792
Why don't...

102
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:43,625
Shit.

103
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:47,058
(cellphone ringing)

104
00:05:47,058 --> 00:05:48,609
Oh fuck.

105
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:50,225
Hi, Roger.

106
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:51,562
- [Roger] Where are you, kiddo?

107
00:05:51,562 --> 00:05:54,972
- I'm standing in the
middle of some filthy alley.

108
00:05:54,972 --> 00:05:56,425
I don't know.
- That's really nice.

109
00:05:56,425 --> 00:05:59,123
Aren't you coming to the meeting?

110
00:05:59,123 --> 00:06:02,496
Ferguson's rejecting our
entire (mumbles) deal.

111
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:06,141
Got a clause in there that
makes his reject invalid.

112
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:08,770
- (sighs) What time's the meeting?

113
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,267
- (mumbles) meeting's in five minutes.

114
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:13,907
This whole nice guy
routine is not workin'.

115
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:17,511
It was your idea and I
need ya down here now.

116
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:20,844
- Okay, (mumbles) okay.

117
00:06:24,422 --> 00:06:25,982
- To sum it all up,

118
00:06:25,982 --> 00:06:28,722
the most important factor in this contract

119
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:33,459
is the 32% that you guys
feel overrides our decision

120
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,219
to build these homeless shelters.

121
00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:36,489
- Important's the key word, Mr Bergman.

122
00:06:36,489 --> 00:06:40,181
You're a business man aren't
you, and you like contracts?

123
00:06:40,181 --> 00:06:41,955
Well contracts are made to be broken.

124
00:06:41,955 --> 00:06:43,824
According to that contract, it's not valid

125
00:06:43,824 --> 00:06:46,815
unless (mumbles) holds
up his end of the deal,

126
00:06:46,815 --> 00:06:49,170
which he hasn't done since January.

127
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,575
- That's a matter of opinion.

128
00:06:50,575 --> 00:06:52,232
- No sir, that is a fact.

129
00:06:52,232 --> 00:06:54,945
Should I present them
to you or did Mr Foster?

130
00:06:54,945 --> 00:06:56,477
Where is Mr Foster anyway?

131
00:06:56,477 --> 00:06:59,036
- Okay, sorry about that folks.

132
00:06:59,036 --> 00:07:00,220
I'm late.

133
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,474
- Would a recess be helpful?

134
00:07:01,474 --> 00:07:05,023
- No no no no, please we're gonna be fine.

135
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:06,280
Please proceed.

136
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,223
What'd I miss?

137
00:07:07,223 --> 00:07:08,198
- We're in the middle of the meeting.

138
00:07:08,198 --> 00:07:09,592
- Okay.

139
00:07:09,592 --> 00:07:11,296
- I was explaining to
your representative here

140
00:07:11,296 --> 00:07:13,562
is that this contract has an out clause

141
00:07:13,562 --> 00:07:15,392
and if you don't--

142
00:07:15,392 --> 00:07:16,225
- Yes, Myra?

143
00:07:16,225 --> 00:07:18,526
- I'm sorry to interrupt,
your wife's on the line.

144
00:07:18,526 --> 00:07:20,059
- Okay, please tell her
I'll call her later.

145
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:22,767
- She says it's urgent.

146
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:24,914
- Alright, I've gotta take this call.

147
00:07:24,914 --> 00:07:26,378
I'm really sorry.

148
00:07:26,378 --> 00:07:27,961
- No no don't go now.

149
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:28,830
- Gotta go.

150
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,580
I've got to take this, I'm sorry.

151
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,438
- Bergman, you sure about that recess

152
00:07:34,438 --> 00:07:35,729
or do you wanna continue?

153
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:39,896
- No no no, I wanna wait
for Michael to come back.

154
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,000
- Annie, I'm right in the middle of the

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,250
biggest presentation of the year, okay?

156
00:07:48,495 --> 00:07:49,643
I got sidetracked this morning.

157
00:07:49,643 --> 00:07:50,560
I was late.

158
00:07:51,431 --> 00:07:55,264
You can't even imagine
what happened to me.

159
00:07:55,264 --> 00:07:58,514
- Honey, I think you need to come home.

160
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:01,133
What, why?

161
00:08:01,133 --> 00:08:02,633
What is so urgent?

162
00:08:04,986 --> 00:08:06,736
- [Annie] She's gone.

163
00:08:10,697 --> 00:08:14,031
- My mother? (sighs)

164
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:15,514
- [Annie] I'm sorry.

165
00:08:15,514 --> 00:08:18,347
(Michael sighing)

166
00:08:24,853 --> 00:08:27,853
- Ooh no. (sobbing)

167
00:08:29,948 --> 00:08:32,615
(phone banging)

168
00:08:38,288 --> 00:08:43,271
(water trickling)
(Michael sobbing)

169
00:08:43,271 --> 00:08:44,854
I'm okay, I'm okay.

170
00:08:51,095 --> 00:08:55,604
(screams) What're you doin' here?

171
00:08:55,604 --> 00:08:59,087
- Your mother's loss is my loss, too.

172
00:08:59,087 --> 00:09:00,270
- Really?

173
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,103
Really?

174
00:09:01,103 --> 00:09:02,154
You never loved her.

175
00:09:02,154 --> 00:09:03,956
She (mumbles).

176
00:09:03,956 --> 00:09:05,734
Just go away.

177
00:09:05,734 --> 00:09:07,178
- I can't.

178
00:09:07,178 --> 00:09:08,970
I got a meeting to conduct.

179
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,029
- No no no no, you're conducting that.

180
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:13,445
I'm postponing the meeting, okay?

181
00:09:13,445 --> 00:09:14,335
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

182
00:09:14,335 --> 00:09:15,516
- You think these people would be happy

183
00:09:15,516 --> 00:09:16,894
to hear that, Michael?

184
00:09:16,894 --> 00:09:18,703
I don't think so!

185
00:09:18,703 --> 00:09:21,112
There are homeless
people all over this city

186
00:09:21,112 --> 00:09:22,606
just need a place to live!

187
00:09:22,606 --> 00:09:23,829
- Well I'll take care of it, okay?

188
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,496
Just get outta here!

189
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,934
You're going to have some very
angry people at you, Mike.

190
00:09:30,934 --> 00:09:33,353
- I don't give a fuck!

191
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:34,923
- Look, I conducted this meeting.

192
00:09:34,923 --> 00:09:37,756
These people need a place to stay!

193
00:09:39,865 --> 00:09:42,948
(soft, somber music)

194
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:50,516
I apologize for the interruption,
there will be no more.

195
00:09:50,516 --> 00:09:51,863
Let us continue.

196
00:09:51,863 --> 00:09:54,544
- I have a family emergency.

197
00:09:54,544 --> 00:09:57,296
I have to call off this
meeting, I'm sorry.

198
00:09:57,296 --> 00:10:00,343
- No, we are going to
have this meeting now!

199
00:10:00,343 --> 00:10:02,312
- No, I said no!

200
00:10:02,312 --> 00:10:04,312
- Is everything alright?

201
00:10:05,848 --> 00:10:08,848
- No no, I'm terribly sorry alright?

202
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:18,254
- (mumbles), what was that?

203
00:10:18,254 --> 00:10:19,717
What the fuck was that?

204
00:10:19,717 --> 00:10:22,467
- I don't have the foggiest idea.

205
00:10:46,922 --> 00:10:48,255
- What happened?

206
00:10:50,004 --> 00:10:50,837
- (sobs) They beat me...

207
00:10:50,837 --> 00:10:52,666
They beat me senseless.

208
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,060
- Who?

209
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,642
What, those punks?

210
00:10:55,642 --> 00:10:57,854
- They always come back.

211
00:10:57,854 --> 00:10:59,873
They do it over and over again.

212
00:10:59,873 --> 00:11:00,706
- No.

213
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,795
- I have no place to go.

214
00:11:05,795 --> 00:11:08,092
- No no no no, it's okay.

215
00:11:08,092 --> 00:11:08,925
It's gonna be okay.

216
00:11:08,925 --> 00:11:12,120
- I have no place to go.
- No no no, it's alright.

217
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,939
It's okay, you're gonna be okay.

218
00:11:14,939 --> 00:11:16,016
You're gonna be okay.

219
00:11:16,016 --> 00:11:18,683
(ominous music)

220
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:23,264
(hard rock music)

221
00:11:29,696 --> 00:11:30,529
- Are you gonna hang out tonight?

222
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:31,362
- Where?

223
00:11:31,362 --> 00:11:32,292
- Hollywood?

224
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,286
- Gonna pick me up?

225
00:11:33,286 --> 00:11:35,863
- Do I have a choice?

226
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:37,363
- See you at 8:00.

227
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:42,758
- Okay come on, can we go now?

228
00:11:42,758 --> 00:11:44,184
- (giggles) I'll see you at 8:00.

229
00:11:44,184 --> 00:11:45,601
- See ya at 8:00.

230
00:11:56,689 --> 00:11:59,772
(soft, somber music)

231
00:12:08,152 --> 00:12:10,135
- Your grandmother died.

232
00:12:10,135 --> 00:12:10,968
- What?

233
00:12:13,396 --> 00:12:15,229
- This morning, honey.

234
00:12:16,076 --> 00:12:16,909
I'm sorry.

235
00:12:20,135 --> 00:12:21,975
This is Jesse.

236
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:26,136
He's going to be staying
with us for a while.

237
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:27,305
- No.

238
00:12:27,305 --> 00:12:28,138
No, why?

239
00:12:29,556 --> 00:12:32,344
- Because that's what your
father needs right now, honey.

240
00:12:32,344 --> 00:12:33,300
- Really?

241
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,331
This is what we needs?

242
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:37,623
Well how many others are
gonna be moving in, huh?

243
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:38,529
- I don't know.

244
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:40,354
- How many fucking others?

245
00:12:40,354 --> 00:12:41,187
- Shh.

246
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:46,556
Josh.

247
00:12:57,686 --> 00:12:58,686
Yes, Sofia?

248
00:13:00,401 --> 00:13:04,318
Hi this is Annie Foster,
Michael Foster's wife.

249
00:13:05,943 --> 00:13:07,693
I think he needs you.

250
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:12,906
(muffled news reporter speech)

251
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:23,079
Hey Joshua, are you goin' someplace?

252
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:24,491
- Out.

253
00:13:24,491 --> 00:13:26,353
- Oh honey, I don't think
that's a very good idea tonight.

254
00:13:26,353 --> 00:13:27,728
- Why?

255
00:13:27,728 --> 00:13:29,330
I barely knew my grandmother.

256
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,684
- Out of respect for your father.

257
00:13:31,684 --> 00:13:33,997
- Who died and left you in charge?

258
00:13:33,997 --> 00:13:35,997
Wait, don't answer that.

259
00:13:39,181 --> 00:13:40,611
- Oh hello, Joshua.

260
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,536
- Oh hi, it's you again.

261
00:13:41,536 --> 00:13:43,081
- [Sofia] Oh my gosh, you've grown up.

262
00:13:43,081 --> 00:13:43,914
- Yeah.

263
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:48,291
- I got here as soon as I could.

264
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,685
- I know, thank you so much.

265
00:13:49,685 --> 00:13:51,068
(mumbles) it's good to see you.

266
00:13:51,068 --> 00:13:52,912
- Well where is Michael?

267
00:13:52,912 --> 00:13:55,527
- Well, Michael hasn't
been here all night.

268
00:13:55,527 --> 00:13:57,700
I think I made a mistake.

269
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,356
I don't think I should've
been the one to tell him.

270
00:13:59,356 --> 00:14:03,479
- No sweetheart don't
blame yourself, okay?

271
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:04,312
Hello.

272
00:14:06,756 --> 00:14:09,407
Well you must be Lily.

273
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,324
- Yeah, I remember you.

274
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:13,865
What do you want?

275
00:14:13,865 --> 00:14:17,242
- Well actually I'm here
to talk with Michael.

276
00:14:17,242 --> 00:14:18,569
- Didn't Annie tell you?

277
00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:20,152
Michael's not here.

278
00:14:21,422 --> 00:14:23,501
- Hmm, then what are you doing here?

279
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:24,913
- I'm staying here now.

280
00:14:24,913 --> 00:14:26,025
- Is that so?

281
00:14:26,025 --> 00:14:28,308
- Yeah, I was invited.

282
00:14:28,308 --> 00:14:31,023
I don't think you were though.

283
00:14:31,023 --> 00:14:32,557
- Where are you going?

284
00:14:32,557 --> 00:14:33,974
- Does it matter?

285
00:14:34,944 --> 00:14:36,384
- It'll matter to Michael.

286
00:14:36,384 --> 00:14:37,521
- Ooh, you gotta be kidding.

287
00:14:37,521 --> 00:14:40,326
Michael doesn't run my life anymore.

288
00:14:40,326 --> 00:14:41,610
- Wait a minute, please.

289
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:42,448
No, wait.
- Just let her go.

290
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:43,596
- Sofia.
- Just let her go.

291
00:14:43,596 --> 00:14:45,442
It will all work out, okay?

292
00:14:45,442 --> 00:14:46,377
- When, by tomorrow?

293
00:14:46,377 --> 00:14:47,210
Because Michael's gonna wanna go

294
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,576
to his mother's wake tomorrow.

295
00:14:48,576 --> 00:14:52,738
- Okay, well then we'll all go together.

296
00:14:52,738 --> 00:14:56,231
- What if his dd shows up or Isaac?

297
00:14:56,231 --> 00:14:57,695
- We will deal with that when it happens.

298
00:14:57,695 --> 00:14:59,514
Let's just hope it doesn't.

299
00:14:59,514 --> 00:15:01,117
Have you seen his father?

300
00:15:01,117 --> 00:15:02,506
- No.

301
00:15:02,506 --> 00:15:03,694
- Isaac?

302
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,444
- No, but Lily was enough for me.

303
00:15:11,248 --> 00:15:14,581
(energetic dance music)

304
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:26,874
- Oh my God, I love this place.

305
00:15:26,874 --> 00:15:27,957
- I love you.

306
00:15:30,357 --> 00:15:31,697
- There's my boy, 'sup Joshua?

307
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:32,776
- What's up, Cory?

308
00:15:32,776 --> 00:15:34,283
- How're you doin'?
- Doin', baby?

309
00:15:34,283 --> 00:15:35,898
- Hey Miss Bree, (mumbles).
- Hi Cory.

310
00:15:35,898 --> 00:15:36,815
- Hey Josh.

311
00:15:41,002 --> 00:15:43,640
- What you doin', man?

312
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,307
(Bree mumbling)

313
00:15:49,024 --> 00:15:50,357
- You're a fool.

314
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,820
(women groaning)
- Be nice.

315
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,237
- Baby, let's go.

316
00:16:00,577 --> 00:16:03,660
- Alright we're gonna dance, alright?

317
00:16:06,905 --> 00:16:07,937
- (mumbles)?

318
00:16:07,937 --> 00:16:08,937
- Yes.
- Yes.

319
00:16:19,975 --> 00:16:24,142
- I don't know what's gotten
into you, but I love it.

320
00:16:34,137 --> 00:16:38,304
(chuckles) I've got Jenna's car keys.

321
00:16:54,716 --> 00:16:57,086
- Oh, I am so sorry.

322
00:16:57,086 --> 00:16:59,385
- Thank you.
- There you go.

323
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:02,250
Wait a minute, I know you.

324
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,083
- Maybe.

325
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:05,939
- You don't remember me, do you?

326
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:07,414
- Should I?

327
00:17:07,414 --> 00:17:09,831
- Hey, you want some company?

328
00:17:11,887 --> 00:17:16,480
- Maybe, that depends on
exactly what you're looking for.

329
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,599
- A little fun for now.

330
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,878
You?

331
00:17:19,878 --> 00:17:20,711
- Hmm.

332
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:32,381
(Bree and Josh giggling)

333
00:17:32,381 --> 00:17:33,333
- You're so big.

334
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,058
- I am.
(Bree giggling)

335
00:17:35,058 --> 00:17:35,959
It's what I do.

336
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:39,633
- (mumbles) getting dizzy.

337
00:17:39,633 --> 00:17:42,300
(lips smacking)

338
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:55,217
(ominous music)

339
00:17:58,048 --> 00:17:59,523
- Yo, c'mon Bree.

340
00:17:59,523 --> 00:18:00,356
- Car's that way.
- Just come on.

341
00:18:00,356 --> 00:18:02,689
- Josh, the car is that way.

342
00:18:03,995 --> 00:18:05,998
- [Woman] You should see these
little silver sandals I got.

343
00:18:05,998 --> 00:18:06,831
They're so gorgeous.

344
00:18:06,831 --> 00:18:07,664
(muffled crosstalk)

345
00:18:07,664 --> 00:18:09,399
I love it, love it, love it.

346
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:12,816
It's got wonderful areas you can walk to.

347
00:18:17,801 --> 00:18:18,912
(birds chirping)

348
00:18:18,912 --> 00:18:21,829
(Michael groaning)

349
00:18:23,659 --> 00:18:26,742
(soft, somber music)

350
00:18:41,483 --> 00:18:44,400
(doorbell ringing)

351
00:18:49,581 --> 00:18:51,210
- Sofia, hi.

352
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:52,673
Please come in.

353
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,673
- Thank you.

354
00:18:55,351 --> 00:18:57,947
I just wanna apologize for last night.

355
00:18:57,947 --> 00:18:59,300
I didn't know that he was
gonna come in at that hour.

356
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,375
- Don't even worry about it, Annie.

357
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:02,770
It's the nature of the beast.

358
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:03,746
I completely understand.

359
00:19:03,746 --> 00:19:05,332
- I appreciate it.

360
00:19:05,332 --> 00:19:07,330
- So what time did he get in last night?

361
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,490
- It was more like morning.

362
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,979
I was already asleep.

363
00:19:09,979 --> 00:19:12,309
- Huh, where is he now?

364
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:13,506
- Upstairs getting ready.

365
00:19:13,506 --> 00:19:14,339
- Okay.

366
00:19:21,222 --> 00:19:24,889
(Michael breathing heavily)

367
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:32,400
Michael?

368
00:19:48,268 --> 00:19:50,351
I am sorry for your loss.

369
00:19:52,074 --> 00:19:53,074
- Thank you.

370
00:19:56,136 --> 00:20:01,031
- I don't know if Lily told
you I was here last night.

371
00:20:01,031 --> 00:20:02,281
- Yeah, I know.

372
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,103
- Where did you go?

373
00:20:06,103 --> 00:20:08,936
(Michael sighing)

374
00:20:19,746 --> 00:20:21,163
Okay, okay, okay.

375
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,130
We won't go there.

376
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:27,326
(Michael weeping)

377
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,409
(soft, somber music)

378
00:20:33,124 --> 00:20:34,792
Okay, okay.
- I can't, I can't.

379
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:36,154
- Okay.
- I can't.

380
00:20:36,154 --> 00:20:37,487
- Okay, I won't.

381
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:44,380
Are you ready to go to your mother's wake?

382
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,181
- (sighs) Of course.

383
00:20:46,181 --> 00:20:49,645
I have to be; I have to be there.

384
00:20:49,645 --> 00:20:51,077
- Well I want you to know

385
00:20:51,077 --> 00:20:54,910
that I'm going to be
there right by your side,

386
00:20:56,484 --> 00:20:58,317
every step of the way.

387
00:21:02,497 --> 00:21:03,330
Okay?

388
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,700
- You're a good friend, Sofia.

389
00:21:29,023 --> 00:21:32,190
- So who's coming with us to the wake?

390
00:21:35,966 --> 00:21:38,716
(birds chirping)

391
00:22:14,488 --> 00:22:18,049
(soft, somber music)

392
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:20,882
(Raymond weeping)

393
00:22:27,354 --> 00:22:29,604
- Okay okay okay, I'm good.

394
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,241
(Raymond weeping)

395
00:22:42,241 --> 00:22:44,133
Okay, it's okay.

396
00:22:44,133 --> 00:22:45,767
It's okay.

397
00:22:45,767 --> 00:22:47,429
It's okay.

398
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:50,446
- We're gonna be okay, brother.

399
00:22:50,446 --> 00:22:51,817
- [Annie] Raymond, do you wanna go outside

400
00:22:51,817 --> 00:22:53,641
and get some fresh air?
- Yeah.

401
00:22:53,641 --> 00:22:54,474
- Alright.

402
00:22:56,127 --> 00:22:57,544
I love you, baby.

403
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:12,099
- Michael, I'm terribly sorry.

404
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,976
- It's alright; thank you, Roger.

405
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:14,809
Thanks.

406
00:23:17,447 --> 00:23:19,037
Did you close that shelter deal?

407
00:23:19,037 --> 00:23:20,291
- Man, don't worry about that now.

408
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:21,973
You're most important.

409
00:23:21,973 --> 00:23:23,443
- No, those people need.
- Get yourself together.

410
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:25,092
- People need a place to live, okay.

411
00:23:25,092 --> 00:23:27,480
They're gonna need a place to live.

412
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,713
- I got you covered, kiddo.

413
00:23:28,713 --> 00:23:29,546
- Okay.
- I got you covered.

414
00:23:29,546 --> 00:23:30,379
- Okay.

415
00:23:31,633 --> 00:23:34,383
Alright. (sighs)

416
00:23:41,242 --> 00:23:42,159
- Let's go.

417
00:23:44,543 --> 00:23:45,626
- Okay, okay.

418
00:23:47,244 --> 00:23:50,327
(soft, somber music)

419
00:24:12,755 --> 00:24:15,588
(Michael weeping)

420
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,059
Okay, I'm gonna need a minute.

421
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:20,898
- Of course.
- (mumbles) okay?

422
00:24:20,898 --> 00:24:21,731
- Okay.

423
00:24:50,786 --> 00:24:53,307
(Raymond weeping)

424
00:24:53,307 --> 00:24:55,323
- Raymond, listen.

425
00:24:55,323 --> 00:24:58,498
I know we haven't always
been that close, but

426
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:00,940
I just want you to know
that I'm very sorry

427
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,107
about your mother's death.

428
00:25:04,993 --> 00:25:07,910
(cries) I'm sorry.

429
00:25:13,292 --> 00:25:14,125
- Hmm.

430
00:25:15,104 --> 00:25:18,021
(foreboding music)

431
00:25:24,672 --> 00:25:26,422
My precious Madeline,

432
00:25:28,893 --> 00:25:31,310
I cannot believe you're dead.

433
00:25:34,624 --> 00:25:37,374
So you finally kicked the bucket.

434
00:25:42,901 --> 00:25:44,734
You really are a cunt!

435
00:25:46,261 --> 00:25:47,605
You did this.

436
00:25:47,605 --> 00:25:49,855
You made your son this way.

437
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:52,642
You dirty whore!

438
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,970
I hope you rot in Hell!

439
00:25:57,053 --> 00:25:59,220
You filthy child molester!

440
00:26:00,085 --> 00:26:01,994
- Lou, where is Michael?

441
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:04,058
- He needs to stay away from this woman!

442
00:26:04,058 --> 00:26:05,225
She's the one.

443
00:26:07,012 --> 00:26:09,512
She's the one who destroy him!

444
00:26:10,532 --> 00:26:11,897
But you can't touch me! (spits)

445
00:26:11,897 --> 00:26:13,170
- Come on.

446
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,288
- You can't touch me!

447
00:26:15,288 --> 00:26:17,955
- Come on, help me find Michael.

448
00:26:19,322 --> 00:26:20,725
- Yeah everyone, please pay him no mind.

449
00:26:20,725 --> 00:26:21,642
He's crazy.

450
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:37,099
- What just happened back there?

451
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:39,817
- What did it look like?

452
00:26:39,817 --> 00:26:42,734
(foreboding music)

453
00:26:47,592 --> 00:26:50,429
- You called Madeline
a child molester, why?

454
00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:52,659
- Because she was.

455
00:26:52,659 --> 00:26:53,909
- I thought so.

456
00:26:55,082 --> 00:26:57,634
So that's why you're here now, isn't it?

457
00:26:57,634 --> 00:27:02,194
- I don't know what you
talkin' about, Miss Drake.

458
00:27:02,194 --> 00:27:04,527
- Annie told me about Jesse.

459
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:09,737
A hurt, afraid, lonely little
boy just like Michael was.

460
00:27:12,178 --> 00:27:14,511
- What are you trying to do?

461
00:27:15,859 --> 00:27:18,913
- It has to make sense, Lou.

462
00:27:18,913 --> 00:27:22,496
Your purpose here, and
Jesse's, and Lily's.

463
00:27:25,075 --> 00:27:26,575
- Oh, Lily's home?

464
00:27:30,402 --> 00:27:32,319
I haven't seen her yet.

465
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,110
- Yes, Lily is here.

466
00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:41,096
Michael's beloved ex wife
and mother of his child.

467
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,832
The most precious thing he had,

468
00:27:44,832 --> 00:27:46,332
a perfect picture.

469
00:27:48,725 --> 00:27:52,892
It is normal to miss her and
to want to bring her back

470
00:27:54,269 --> 00:27:55,436
into his life.

471
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,642
Wouldn't you say so, Lou?

472
00:28:03,188 --> 00:28:06,355
- All this chatter is wearing me down.

473
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,288
I'm here because my son needs me

474
00:28:11,288 --> 00:28:13,786
and I have to help him.

475
00:28:13,786 --> 00:28:15,369
He needs all of us.

476
00:28:16,621 --> 00:28:18,491
- No he doesn't, Lou.

477
00:28:18,491 --> 00:28:20,741
You're all hurting Michael.

478
00:28:24,074 --> 00:28:26,074
- That's what you think?

479
00:28:29,571 --> 00:28:32,404
Would you like to see Michael now?

480
00:28:35,086 --> 00:28:37,638
- I would love to see Michael now.

481
00:28:37,638 --> 00:28:39,388
- Good, come with me.

482
00:28:40,957 --> 00:28:43,707
(birds chirping)

483
00:28:56,777 --> 00:29:00,360
- Do you carry a gun
with you all the time?

484
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,193
- Yes.

485
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:07,882
- Yeah, we used to keep
a gun in the house.

486
00:29:07,882 --> 00:29:10,215
It scared the hell outta me.

487
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:17,474
- It's been such a long
time since I've been here.

488
00:29:17,474 --> 00:29:18,307
- I know.

489
00:29:26,228 --> 00:29:28,978
- You know, my mother, she did...

490
00:29:30,228 --> 00:29:32,885
She didn't do anything to Michael.

491
00:29:32,885 --> 00:29:34,267
I don't care what he says.

492
00:29:34,267 --> 00:29:36,887
I don't really care what anyone says.

493
00:29:36,887 --> 00:29:40,663
- Raymond, you have to know
that Michael loved his mother.

494
00:29:40,663 --> 00:29:42,163
- Then why'd he...

495
00:29:47,877 --> 00:29:51,532
(Bree laughing)
- Yeah, oh yeah.

496
00:29:51,532 --> 00:29:52,532
- I'm sorry.

497
00:29:53,395 --> 00:29:54,608
Why didn't you tell me
your grandmother died?

498
00:29:54,608 --> 00:29:56,797
I would've gone to the funeral.

499
00:29:56,797 --> 00:29:59,505
- 'Cause I didn't really care.

500
00:29:59,505 --> 00:30:02,755
Oh come on, don't look at me like that.

501
00:30:04,215 --> 00:30:08,847
You know that expression
only the good die young?

502
00:30:08,847 --> 00:30:12,061
Well, she should have lived to be 400.

503
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:13,085
- That's old.

504
00:30:13,085 --> 00:30:14,325
- I could lay here and
tell you stories about her

505
00:30:14,325 --> 00:30:16,715
until the middle of next year.

506
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:18,110
But I don't wanna risk the chance of her

507
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,307
coming back and haunting me.

508
00:30:20,307 --> 00:30:23,722
- (laughs) She can't be that bad.

509
00:30:23,722 --> 00:30:25,389
- Trust me, she was.

510
00:30:29,181 --> 00:30:30,681
- You wanna go in?

511
00:30:32,955 --> 00:30:35,872
- No, my father's coming home soon.

512
00:30:36,721 --> 00:30:38,108
- So what?

513
00:30:38,108 --> 00:30:41,191
I thought you said he would adore me.

514
00:30:43,797 --> 00:30:44,964
- Not anymore.

515
00:30:47,047 --> 00:30:48,453
- You know, I feel like every time

516
00:30:48,453 --> 00:30:50,732
this Sofia Drake person
comes into the picture,

517
00:30:50,732 --> 00:30:51,565
something bad happens.

518
00:30:51,565 --> 00:30:52,744
- [Annie] That's not true.

519
00:30:52,744 --> 00:30:54,056
- Oh, it isn't?

520
00:30:54,056 --> 00:30:58,223
Please tell me how any of this
makes sense to you at all.

521
00:30:59,527 --> 00:31:03,527
- I wouldn't expect you
to understand any of it.

522
00:31:05,425 --> 00:31:08,092
(phone ringing)

523
00:31:11,586 --> 00:31:12,738
Hello.

524
00:31:12,738 --> 00:31:15,121
- Annie, I had a long talk with Michael.

525
00:31:15,121 --> 00:31:16,938
- Okay, where is he?

526
00:31:16,938 --> 00:31:19,994
- Well, we came to my house.

527
00:31:19,994 --> 00:31:23,661
I actually don't know
where he is right now.

528
00:31:25,834 --> 00:31:27,654
But I have to warn you.

529
00:31:27,654 --> 00:31:31,877
I have a feeling I know who
your next guest is going to be.

530
00:31:31,877 --> 00:31:35,127
- (sighs) Oh God, who?

531
00:31:37,684 --> 00:31:40,250
- Isaac is on his way over.

532
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,253
(ominous music)

533
00:31:42,253 --> 00:31:45,826
Annie, you know how dangerous Isaac is.

534
00:31:45,826 --> 00:31:47,929
He cannot stay in that house.

535
00:31:47,929 --> 00:31:49,418
Call the police.

536
00:31:49,418 --> 00:31:50,834
You do not let him in!

537
00:31:50,834 --> 00:31:51,765
- What are you talking about?

538
00:31:51,765 --> 00:31:52,689
I can't call the police.

539
00:31:52,689 --> 00:31:53,872
You know that.

540
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:55,706
- For your best interest
and for the best interest

541
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:59,169
of your son, you cannot let him in.

542
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:00,265
- Look please, just stop it alright.

543
00:32:00,265 --> 00:32:01,648
I made a mistake.

544
00:32:01,648 --> 00:32:02,708
I shouldn't have called you.

545
00:32:02,708 --> 00:32:03,929
You're making things worse.

546
00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:06,017
Please don't call here.

547
00:32:06,017 --> 00:32:06,850
- Annie?

548
00:32:08,232 --> 00:32:09,065
Annie?

549
00:32:12,312 --> 00:32:13,861
- What is it?

550
00:32:13,861 --> 00:32:15,422
- Issac is on his way.

551
00:32:15,422 --> 00:32:16,792
- See, see what I mean?

552
00:32:16,792 --> 00:32:17,966
- Fuck you!

553
00:32:17,966 --> 00:32:20,716
(sinister music)

554
00:32:24,473 --> 00:32:25,306
- Whoo!

555
00:32:26,394 --> 00:32:27,644
I'm home, baby.

556
00:32:33,844 --> 00:32:35,844
The fuck you lookin' at?

557
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:41,405
- Joshua, get in the house now.

558
00:32:41,405 --> 00:32:42,668
- He's fuckin' crazy.

559
00:32:42,668 --> 00:32:45,809
- Josh, just get in the house please.

560
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:47,926
- What you gonna do, huh?

561
00:32:47,926 --> 00:32:49,368
- Fuck you what am I gonna do.

562
00:32:49,368 --> 00:32:50,677
What the fuck are you gonna do?

563
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:51,510
- I can arrest you right now.

564
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,380
- Are you gonna arrest me?

565
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,568
What grounds, you fuckin' pig?

566
00:32:53,568 --> 00:32:54,612
- It's alright, Ray.

567
00:32:54,612 --> 00:32:57,719
Let's go in the house right
now and lock the door please.

568
00:32:57,719 --> 00:33:00,953
- Lemme in this fuckin' house, bitch!

569
00:33:00,953 --> 00:33:01,786
(Isaac mumbling)

570
00:33:01,786 --> 00:33:02,643
- He's going insane.

571
00:33:02,643 --> 00:33:03,476
I have to--
- I know, just let him...

572
00:33:03,476 --> 00:33:04,894
Let him calm down, okay.

573
00:33:04,894 --> 00:33:05,727
He's going--

574
00:33:05,727 --> 00:33:07,008
- Yeah goin' where and do what?

575
00:33:07,008 --> 00:33:08,103
- I don't know, but please.

576
00:33:08,103 --> 00:33:09,320
Just give it a minute.

577
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,562
- You're making this worse, Annie.

578
00:33:10,562 --> 00:33:12,341
- You can't arrest him anyway.

579
00:33:12,341 --> 00:33:13,385
This is not your jurisdiction.

580
00:33:13,385 --> 00:33:14,638
- Listen to me, I'm not gonna
stand here and do nothing

581
00:33:14,638 --> 00:33:16,560
while this maniac tries
to break into this house.

582
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,908
- Fuckin' owe me this house!

583
00:33:17,908 --> 00:33:19,525
- Get out of my way before I arrest you.

584
00:33:19,525 --> 00:33:21,858
- Alright, alright, alright.

585
00:33:39,448 --> 00:33:42,365
(Annie whispering)

586
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:54,109
(crickets chirping)
(Jesse crying)

587
00:33:54,109 --> 00:33:57,026
(foreboding music)

588
00:34:35,755 --> 00:34:38,922
- (weeps) I'm afraid.

589
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:42,205
I'm afraid.

590
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:46,078
- It's okay.

591
00:34:46,078 --> 00:34:46,911
It's okay.

592
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:50,191
Shhh!

593
00:34:59,118 --> 00:35:00,840
Joshua, come on down honey.

594
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,423
Breakfast is ready.

595
00:35:04,266 --> 00:35:05,969
- Okay, we gotta get
that room fixed upstairs.

596
00:35:05,969 --> 00:35:09,150
That's dad's room; I promised to fix it.

597
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,254
- Honey, what's going on?

598
00:35:11,254 --> 00:35:13,789
What are you doing and
where are you going?

599
00:35:13,789 --> 00:35:15,278
- I'm going to work.

600
00:35:15,278 --> 00:35:16,803
I've fallen way behind.

601
00:35:16,803 --> 00:35:18,436
There's dozens of homeless people

602
00:35:18,436 --> 00:35:21,396
who need a place to live and I'm here.

603
00:35:21,396 --> 00:35:23,776
- Great, why don't we just
invite everybody here.

604
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,609
- What?

605
00:35:25,937 --> 00:35:26,770
- Nothing.

606
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,270
Honey, listen to me okay.

607
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,884
I spoke to Roger.

608
00:35:30,884 --> 00:35:32,575
He's got everything under control.

609
00:35:32,575 --> 00:35:34,500
Okay baby, it's too early
for you to go back to work.

610
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,186
- I can't, I can't stay here.

611
00:35:36,186 --> 00:35:37,517
- No!
- This isn't helping me.

612
00:35:37,517 --> 00:35:38,973
- Listen to me, the pressure of work's

613
00:35:38,973 --> 00:35:40,769
not gonna do you any good.

614
00:35:40,769 --> 00:35:42,637
You need time off.

615
00:35:42,637 --> 00:35:43,877
- (scoffs) No, I had time off.

616
00:35:43,877 --> 00:35:45,185
How much time do I need?

617
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:46,497
- Baby, I don't know.

618
00:35:46,497 --> 00:35:48,729
Maybe when I get to spend
some time with my husband,

619
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:51,069
the man that I married.

620
00:35:51,069 --> 00:35:53,815
Or maybe once these intruders stop coming

621
00:35:53,815 --> 00:35:54,892
in and out of our lives,

622
00:35:54,892 --> 00:35:57,059
in this house, in my life.

623
00:36:00,731 --> 00:36:01,564
Please.

624
00:36:03,013 --> 00:36:05,997
- I'm sorry, I have to go to work.

625
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,914
- What's he doin' here?

626
00:36:10,031 --> 00:36:13,308
- Good morning to you too, son.

627
00:36:13,308 --> 00:36:16,308
- (whispers) Don't.

628
00:36:19,489 --> 00:36:21,897
♪ Mmmm ♪

629
00:36:21,897 --> 00:36:24,420
- Good morning, Annie.

630
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,503
I almost forgot my lunch.

631
00:36:29,158 --> 00:36:29,991
Michael!

632
00:36:31,574 --> 00:36:34,241
(Josh laughing)

633
00:36:45,968 --> 00:36:47,596
- Now you let me conduct this meeting

634
00:36:47,596 --> 00:36:49,763
the way it should be done.

635
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,959
- [Michael] I'm conducting the meeting.

636
00:36:52,959 --> 00:36:55,752
I'm conducting the meeting, okay.

637
00:36:55,752 --> 00:36:58,335
- Michael, I'm your mouthpiece.

638
00:36:59,303 --> 00:37:01,523
You can't do this without me.

639
00:37:01,523 --> 00:37:02,818
(Michael breathing heavily)

640
00:37:02,818 --> 00:37:04,614
- Just shut up.

641
00:37:04,614 --> 00:37:05,779
Shut up!

642
00:37:05,779 --> 00:37:07,279
Yes I can!

643
00:37:07,279 --> 00:37:08,815
Yes I can!

644
00:37:08,815 --> 00:37:11,030
Just leave me the fuck alone, okay?

645
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,274
Just get outta my life!

646
00:37:12,274 --> 00:37:13,510
Get outta my car!

647
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,805
Just get outta my car!

648
00:37:14,805 --> 00:37:15,915
Get the fuck outta my life!

649
00:37:15,915 --> 00:37:17,332
Get outta my car!

650
00:37:21,096 --> 00:37:22,710
What?

651
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:25,377
(phone ringing)

652
00:37:30,368 --> 00:37:31,201
- Hello.

653
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:33,644
- [Annie] Raymond, it's Annie.

654
00:37:33,644 --> 00:37:34,922
- Oh hey, Annie.

655
00:37:34,922 --> 00:37:36,063
- [Annie] Sorry, did I wake you?

656
00:37:36,063 --> 00:37:37,952
- No no, actually it's fine.

657
00:37:37,952 --> 00:37:39,141
What's up?

658
00:37:39,141 --> 00:37:41,415
- Listen, I wanna get the
phone number of your friend.

659
00:37:41,415 --> 00:37:43,281
You know, the real estate agent.

660
00:37:43,281 --> 00:37:44,430
- Bernie?

661
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,513
Yes actually.

662
00:37:46,799 --> 00:37:49,198
She just so happens to
be right next to me.

663
00:37:49,198 --> 00:37:50,031
Hold on.

664
00:37:52,023 --> 00:37:54,159
(Raymond chuckling)

665
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:55,159
- Annie, hi.

666
00:37:56,749 --> 00:37:57,749
How are you?

667
00:37:58,688 --> 00:38:00,188
- Could be better.

668
00:38:01,761 --> 00:38:04,481
I think I need to sell our house.

669
00:38:04,481 --> 00:38:05,927
- Oh.

670
00:38:05,927 --> 00:38:08,964
(ominous music)

671
00:38:08,964 --> 00:38:09,865
- Leave me alone.

672
00:38:09,865 --> 00:38:11,577
Will you go away?

673
00:38:11,577 --> 00:38:14,654
- You can't do this without me.

674
00:38:14,654 --> 00:38:16,668
- Yes I fucking can!

675
00:38:16,668 --> 00:38:17,668
I can do it!

676
00:38:19,278 --> 00:38:21,476
- I'm not going to leave you alone.

677
00:38:21,476 --> 00:38:24,309
(Michael weeping)

678
00:38:28,003 --> 00:38:28,836
Help me!

679
00:38:31,096 --> 00:38:31,929
Help me!

680
00:38:34,194 --> 00:38:35,709
Help me!

681
00:38:35,709 --> 00:38:38,709
(muffled crosstalk)

682
00:38:41,981 --> 00:38:42,898
- Hey Josh.

683
00:38:43,984 --> 00:38:45,424
God Josh, where you been?

684
00:38:45,424 --> 00:38:46,387
- Around.

685
00:38:46,387 --> 00:38:49,251
- I haven't seen much of you
since that night at your house.

686
00:38:49,251 --> 00:38:52,214
Have you been avoiding me?

687
00:38:52,214 --> 00:38:53,729
- (sighs) I don't wanna
talk about it, okay?

688
00:38:53,729 --> 00:38:55,234
I'm late to class.

689
00:38:55,234 --> 00:38:57,711
- God Josh, what the
hell is this all about?

690
00:38:57,711 --> 00:39:00,543
I mean did your uncle end
up arresting that guy?

691
00:39:00,543 --> 00:39:01,560
I have so many questions.

692
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,186
It just kind of freaked me out.

693
00:39:03,186 --> 00:39:04,264
- Yeah, wasn't that just great?

694
00:39:04,264 --> 00:39:07,130
I'm late to class, alright.

695
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:08,367
- What is going on with you?

696
00:39:08,367 --> 00:39:09,784
- Back off, okay.

697
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,880
- That's it.

698
00:39:21,247 --> 00:39:22,799
It's alright.

699
00:39:22,799 --> 00:39:25,284
Set your feet, Lashay.

700
00:39:25,284 --> 00:39:26,117
That's it.

701
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:28,414
Nice, clean shot.

702
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:30,573
Nice.

703
00:39:30,573 --> 00:39:31,720
Next time you're not in uniform, Sierra,

704
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,054
you're gonna run a suicide.

705
00:39:33,054 --> 00:39:34,304
Hold your feet.

706
00:39:36,425 --> 00:39:37,258
Almost.

707
00:39:38,772 --> 00:39:39,756
Marina.

708
00:39:39,756 --> 00:39:40,659
(whistle blowing)

709
00:39:40,659 --> 00:39:42,050
Can I get you to take my place?

710
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,823
Very good, keep going girls.

711
00:39:43,823 --> 00:39:45,420
Marina's got it.

712
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,238
(balls smacking floor)

713
00:39:47,238 --> 00:39:48,679
Hey, is everything alright?

714
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:51,809
- I don't know how long
we can go on like this.

715
00:39:51,809 --> 00:39:52,809
- Look Josh,

716
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,831
I have a very special place in my heart

717
00:39:55,831 --> 00:39:57,778
for you and your dad.

718
00:39:57,778 --> 00:40:02,111
The day I married your
father, you became my son.

719
00:40:02,111 --> 00:40:03,591
I'm committed to that and
I'm not gonna walk away

720
00:40:03,591 --> 00:40:06,591
from either one of you, you hear me?

721
00:40:10,303 --> 00:40:11,303
- Thank you.

722
00:40:17,688 --> 00:40:19,005
- Alright Sierra, that's
not how I taught you

723
00:40:19,005 --> 00:40:21,505
to dribble the ball.
- Hi Josh.

724
00:40:21,505 --> 00:40:23,680
- Come on now, get back to practice.

725
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,226
Focus girls, come on.

726
00:40:25,226 --> 00:40:26,095
(girls clapping rhythmically)

727
00:40:26,095 --> 00:40:28,557
I swear that girl is such a flirt.

728
00:40:28,557 --> 00:40:29,912
- She's hot.
- Yeah, I'm afraid

729
00:40:29,912 --> 00:40:31,614
she knows it.

730
00:40:31,614 --> 00:40:33,208
Wait a second, don't
you have a girlfriend?

731
00:40:33,208 --> 00:40:37,037
(ball smacking floor)

732
00:40:37,037 --> 00:40:38,127
Honey, are you gonna be alright?

733
00:40:38,127 --> 00:40:39,474
Huh?
- Yeah

734
00:40:39,474 --> 00:40:40,750
I guess I'd better go.

735
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:44,071
- Okay sweetie, I'll
see you at home, okay?

736
00:40:44,071 --> 00:40:45,238
- Okay.
- Okay.

737
00:40:47,733 --> 00:40:50,233
Alright, let's keep the focus.

738
00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:55,119
(mumbles) that's okay.

739
00:40:57,951 --> 00:41:00,034
- [Josh] I love you, mom.

740
00:41:05,649 --> 00:41:07,203
- I love you too, Joshy.

741
00:41:07,203 --> 00:41:10,286
(soft, somber music)

742
00:41:20,432 --> 00:41:21,491
(whistle blowing)

743
00:41:21,491 --> 00:41:24,241
(soft pop music)

744
00:41:40,068 --> 00:41:41,308
- Um, excuse me.

745
00:41:41,308 --> 00:41:42,325
- What?

746
00:41:42,325 --> 00:41:46,677
- You're trying everything
on and you're making a mess.

747
00:41:46,677 --> 00:41:47,846
- And?

748
00:41:47,846 --> 00:41:51,137
- Are you going to buy anything?

749
00:41:51,137 --> 00:41:52,287
- (scoffs) Would you just leave me alone

750
00:41:52,287 --> 00:41:54,044
and let me make up my mind?

751
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:56,284
You're hounding me.

752
00:41:56,284 --> 00:41:58,117
- My God, you're sick.

753
00:41:59,185 --> 00:42:00,102
- Fuck you.

754
00:42:06,201 --> 00:42:07,701
Ooh, hey handsome.

755
00:42:11,922 --> 00:42:13,005
Mmm, not bad.

756
00:42:18,919 --> 00:42:21,586
(phone ringing)

757
00:42:24,553 --> 00:42:25,386
- Hello.

758
00:42:27,348 --> 00:42:28,848
Michael, you here?

759
00:42:31,219 --> 00:42:32,785
Hello?

760
00:42:32,785 --> 00:42:34,429
- [Roger] Hello, Annie?

761
00:42:34,429 --> 00:42:35,650
It's Roger.

762
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:36,891
- [Annie] Hi Roger.

763
00:42:36,891 --> 00:42:39,978
- I'm just callin' to see if
everything;s okay with Michael.

764
00:42:39,978 --> 00:42:42,165
- Why, what did he do?

765
00:42:42,165 --> 00:42:43,236
- He just called this morning,

766
00:42:43,236 --> 00:42:45,312
said he was coming into the office

767
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:46,979
and he never showed.

768
00:42:49,098 --> 00:42:50,092
- Uh yeah, yeah Roger.

769
00:42:50,092 --> 00:42:52,300
Everything is fine.

770
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,484
You know what, I gotta go.

771
00:42:53,484 --> 00:42:54,851
But thank you so much for calling

772
00:42:54,851 --> 00:42:57,101
and you have a great night.

773
00:43:06,691 --> 00:43:07,524
- Michael!

774
00:43:08,824 --> 00:43:09,991
You scared me.

775
00:43:11,131 --> 00:43:12,061
Where have you been?

776
00:43:12,061 --> 00:43:13,075
Roger just called.

777
00:43:13,075 --> 00:43:14,498
He said you didn't make it to work today.

778
00:43:14,498 --> 00:43:18,347
- I just lost track of
time today, that's all.

779
00:43:18,347 --> 00:43:20,102
I just--
- What?

780
00:43:20,102 --> 00:43:21,876
- I think I'd better go lay down.

781
00:43:21,876 --> 00:43:23,709
I just need some rest.

782
00:43:29,393 --> 00:43:31,520
(phone banging on table)

783
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,352
(keys rattling)

784
00:43:34,352 --> 00:43:36,997
(door slamming)

785
00:43:36,997 --> 00:43:39,211
(muffled crosstalk)

786
00:43:39,211 --> 00:43:40,135
- [Man] There's no way.

787
00:43:40,135 --> 00:43:41,924
I don't wanna live in this house.

788
00:43:41,924 --> 00:43:44,924
(muffled crosstalk)

789
00:43:46,962 --> 00:43:49,989
If you think you're going to...

790
00:43:49,989 --> 00:43:51,644
I know that I'm gonna stay here.

791
00:43:51,644 --> 00:43:54,644
(muffled crosstalk)

792
00:43:58,605 --> 00:44:00,855
But Michael, Michael you...

793
00:44:06,702 --> 00:44:09,785
(soft, somber music)

794
00:45:06,481 --> 00:45:10,227
- Now the baker's sells
the coconut cake too.

795
00:45:10,227 --> 00:45:11,894
We have, here we go.

796
00:45:12,965 --> 00:45:13,798
- [Guests] cake, cake, cake!

797
00:45:13,798 --> 00:45:15,590
- Mr and Mrs...

798
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:16,498
Whoa whoa whoa.

799
00:45:16,498 --> 00:45:18,314
Right there, right there.

800
00:45:18,314 --> 00:45:19,384
And here we go.

801
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:20,771
We're goin' again in one for...

802
00:45:20,771 --> 00:45:21,688
One for me.

803
00:45:22,528 --> 00:45:23,361
Her first.

804
00:45:25,836 --> 00:45:28,708
(wedding guests awing)

805
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:30,682
That's really good.

806
00:45:30,682 --> 00:45:32,549
That's really good cake.

807
00:45:32,549 --> 00:45:33,717
That's really good.

808
00:45:33,717 --> 00:45:34,772
Now this is your cake.

809
00:45:34,772 --> 00:45:36,286
That's really great though.

810
00:45:36,286 --> 00:45:38,394
I don't know, can she handle the big one?

811
00:45:38,394 --> 00:45:40,727
- [Guests] cake, cake, cake!

812
00:45:45,351 --> 00:45:46,827
(wedding guests cheering)

813
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:48,848
- I love you, Michael.

814
00:45:48,848 --> 00:45:50,765
I will always love you.

815
00:46:05,251 --> 00:46:08,084
(Michael weeping)

816
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,837
- Hi, table for one?

817
00:46:22,837 --> 00:46:25,265
- No thank you, I'm
actually meeting someone.

818
00:46:25,265 --> 00:46:27,149
She's already here.

819
00:46:27,149 --> 00:46:29,899
- I'll be right with you.
- Great.

820
00:46:31,236 --> 00:46:33,515
- Hey.
- How are you?

821
00:46:33,515 --> 00:46:35,098
- I'm good, thanks.

822
00:46:36,036 --> 00:46:38,089
- I'm so sorry I'm late.

823
00:46:38,089 --> 00:46:40,952
I had to stop of at the
house and pick something up.

824
00:46:40,952 --> 00:46:42,268
I apologize.

825
00:46:42,268 --> 00:46:43,526
- Don't worry about it, I just got here.

826
00:46:43,526 --> 00:46:46,867
Anything to get me out of the office.

827
00:46:46,867 --> 00:46:48,637
Would you like a cup of coffee?

828
00:46:48,637 --> 00:46:50,798
- Yeah sure, that'd be great.

829
00:46:50,798 --> 00:46:51,798
- Excuse me.

830
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:56,487
Hi, can we get two cups of coffee, please?

831
00:46:56,487 --> 00:46:58,070
- Sure.
- Thank you.

832
00:47:00,449 --> 00:47:04,332
I just wanna thank you so
much for meeting me here.

833
00:47:04,332 --> 00:47:05,980
It know it was last minute,

834
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:07,278
I appreciate it.

835
00:47:07,278 --> 00:47:08,166
- It's no problem.

836
00:47:08,166 --> 00:47:11,414
It sounded really
important when you called.

837
00:47:11,414 --> 00:47:13,081
- Yeah, I think I...

838
00:47:15,796 --> 00:47:19,260
I think I really need to sell that house.

839
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:21,343
- It's a beautiful house.

840
00:47:22,314 --> 00:47:24,273
Annie, don't worry.

841
00:47:24,273 --> 00:47:26,735
I'm not gonna have a problem selling it.

842
00:47:26,735 --> 00:47:28,329
(soft, soothing music)

843
00:47:28,329 --> 00:47:32,385
- You know, I don't know if
you know all the details.

844
00:47:32,385 --> 00:47:35,302
But the house, it's not in my name.

845
00:47:37,041 --> 00:47:38,741
- I know, Raymond told me everything.

846
00:47:38,741 --> 00:47:41,114
Annie look, I'm here
because I'm your friend.

847
00:47:41,114 --> 00:47:44,614
I'm not just your real estate agent, okay?

848
00:47:46,566 --> 00:47:48,733
We're gonna work this out.

849
00:47:49,882 --> 00:47:50,715
Hey,

850
00:47:53,991 --> 00:47:55,574
it's gonna be okay.

851
00:47:57,929 --> 00:48:01,096
- I appreciate it.
- Anytime, sweetie.

852
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:05,220
(soft guitar music)

853
00:48:10,457 --> 00:48:11,290
- Hello?

854
00:48:38,695 --> 00:48:42,778
(video game controller clicking)

855
00:49:09,226 --> 00:49:10,707
- Josh, what's going on?

856
00:49:10,707 --> 00:49:11,999
- I just gotta get the
hell out of here right now.

857
00:49:11,999 --> 00:49:13,499
- Where are you going?

858
00:49:13,499 --> 00:49:14,416
Josh, wait!

859
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:23,377
(feet stomping)

860
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:31,693
(soft ominous music)

861
00:49:36,509 --> 00:49:39,176
(phone dialing)

862
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:43,294
Yeah Sofia, it's Annie again.

863
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:58,813
- Jesse?

864
00:50:02,136 --> 00:50:05,045
Jesse, I've never met you before.

865
00:50:05,045 --> 00:50:08,712
I'm Sofia Drake, a good
friend of Michael's.

866
00:50:09,613 --> 00:50:12,030
Can you come down from there?

867
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,162
- What do you want?

868
00:50:15,162 --> 00:50:18,495
- I wanna meet you, ask a few questions.

869
00:50:20,202 --> 00:50:23,619
- No, I don't wanna answer any questions.

870
00:50:25,547 --> 00:50:28,492
- They're simple questions, Jesse.

871
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:30,440
- [Jesse] Like?

872
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:34,273
- Well, I wanna know
when you plan on leaving.

873
00:50:36,764 --> 00:50:38,097
- I can't leave.

874
00:50:41,253 --> 00:50:42,670
Michael needs me.

875
00:50:43,766 --> 00:50:46,550
- I don't know how true that is.

876
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:48,647
Where did you meet Michael?

877
00:50:48,647 --> 00:50:49,730
- In an alley

878
00:50:51,013 --> 00:50:52,180
on the street.

879
00:50:55,898 --> 00:50:57,231
He protected me.

880
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:03,507
- Are you afraid of something, Jesse?

881
00:51:05,834 --> 00:51:09,501
Can you please, please
come down from there?

882
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:12,268
- No.

883
00:51:17,784 --> 00:51:18,867
- Okay, fine.

884
00:51:40,919 --> 00:51:44,502
Well, I'll just talk
to you from here then.

885
00:51:58,929 --> 00:52:01,429
When Michael was a little boy,

886
00:52:02,695 --> 00:52:06,246
he had a difficult time finding friends.

887
00:52:06,246 --> 00:52:07,746
Did you know that?

888
00:52:09,269 --> 00:52:10,519
He overcame it.

889
00:52:12,995 --> 00:52:15,745
He was married, created a family.

890
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,663
He has a grown son.

891
00:52:20,367 --> 00:52:22,784
What do you think about that?

892
00:52:23,929 --> 00:52:26,114
- I know, I know all of this.

893
00:52:26,114 --> 00:52:28,415
- Okay well then you
know he's happily married

894
00:52:28,415 --> 00:52:30,935
to Annie and that you're an intrusion

895
00:52:30,935 --> 00:52:33,602
on their lives right now, right?

896
00:52:36,872 --> 00:52:38,789
I guess you don't care.

897
00:52:42,408 --> 00:52:44,325
How old are you, Jesse?

898
00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:48,652
- 16.

899
00:52:58,144 --> 00:52:59,273
Hey,

900
00:52:59,273 --> 00:53:00,106
hey!

901
00:53:02,523 --> 00:53:03,356
Hey!

902
00:53:05,086 --> 00:53:08,503
- You get down now off this roof alright?

903
00:53:12,953 --> 00:53:15,703
(hammer banging)

904
00:53:20,662 --> 00:53:22,412
- What are you doin'?

905
00:53:24,407 --> 00:53:26,407
- I'm selling the house.

906
00:53:27,739 --> 00:53:29,313
- You can't do that.

907
00:53:29,313 --> 00:53:32,212
You can't sell the house.

908
00:53:32,212 --> 00:53:35,658
- Okay, I'm gonna make
this as easy as possible.

909
00:53:35,658 --> 00:53:36,491
Okay?

910
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:43,853
- Hey what's goin' on?

911
00:53:45,245 --> 00:53:46,529
So you're sellin' the house?

912
00:53:46,529 --> 00:53:48,940
- Yup, I'm gonna try.

913
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:49,773
- Wow, how in the world

914
00:53:49,773 --> 00:53:50,691
did you get Michael to agree to that?

915
00:53:50,691 --> 00:53:51,590
- I have no idea.

916
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:52,732
He came home late one night

917
00:53:52,732 --> 00:53:55,952
and I threw the papers
at him and he signed.

918
00:53:55,952 --> 00:53:56,785
- Hmm.

919
00:54:09,823 --> 00:54:13,990
(electronic dance music)
(muffled speech)

920
00:54:24,268 --> 00:54:25,514
- Let him go!
- Whoa whoa, okay.

921
00:54:25,514 --> 00:54:26,347
- Shut up!

922
00:54:26,347 --> 00:54:27,180
Come on, Sierra.

923
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,886
(muffled speech)

924
00:54:28,886 --> 00:54:30,219
- What the fuck?

925
00:54:31,147 --> 00:54:32,202

00:54:34,321 --> 00:54:35,744

00:55:01,461 --> 00:55:03,119
- Maybe.

942
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:05,961
So you and Bree broke up?

943
00:55:05,961 --> 00:55:07,544
- Yeah, good guess.

944
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:11,036
Aren't you on my mother's basketball team?

945
00:55:11,036 --> 00:55:12,786

946

947
00:55:17,643 --> 00:55:19,703
Anyways, do you want this?

948
00:55:19,703 --> 00:55:20,862

949
00:55:20,862 --> 00:55:22,195
- Do you want X?

950
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,300
It's not gonna kill you.

951
00:55:34,556 --> 00:55:37,306
(sinister music)

952
00:56:38,733 --> 00:56:41,443
- Who the fuck are you to

(rhythmic dance music)

959
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:28,406

00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:35,150

00:58:22,448 --> 00:58:25,043
- Why did you crash?
- I didn't crash.

970
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:25,876
- You did crash.

971
00:58:25,876 --> 00:58:27,478
- I gotta get my boy outta the car safe.

972
00:58:27,478 --> 00:58:30,102
- It's a crash.
- That's not a crash, alright.

973
00:58:30,102 --> 00:58:32,316
You want this boy to
crash his ass on cement.

974
00:58:32,316 --> 00:58:33,743
- Okay.
- Joshua.

975
00:58:33,743 --> 00:58:35,493
Hey, Joshua.

You fine, fine.

00:58:47,248 --> 00:58:48,489
Your boy just got you home.

985
00:58:48,489 --> 00:58:50,498
Don't fall down, don't fall down.

986
00:58:50,498 --> 00:58:51,331
There you go.

987
00:58:51,331 --> 00:58:52,957
You alright?

00:58:56,436 --> 00:58:59,842
I know you though 'cause I am too.

00:58:59,842 --> 00:59:02,598
Let's get your ass inside.

992
00:59:02,598 --> 00:59:05,348
(sinister music)

993
00:59:08,173 --> 00:59:09,384
You be alright with that?

994
00:59:09,384 --> 00:59:11,801
- Yeah, I'll be fine.
- Yeah?

995
00:59:21,147 --> 00:59:21,980
- Smoke?

996
00:59:24,271 --> 00:59:27,104
Don't be a fuckin' pussy, take it!

997
00:59:33,688 --> 00:59:37,287
You're fucked up. (laughs)

998
00:59:37,287 --> 00:59:41,370
Yeah, you're fucked up. (sniffs)

999
00:59:43,898 --> 00:59:45,315
Did you get laid?

1000
00:59:48,493 --> 00:59:49,493
Yeah, wahoo!

1001
00:59:51,068 --> 00:59:52,651
I'll drink to that.

1002
00:59:58,712 --> 01:00:00,851
Get some of this.

1003
01:00:00,851 --> 01:00:02,268
Get some of that.

1004
01:00:08,348 --> 01:00:10,234
(chuckles) Kill it.

1005
01:00:10,234 --> 01:00:12,523
Yeah, fuckin' kill it.

1006
01:00:12,523 --> 01:00:13,356
Nice.

1007
01:00:23,259 --> 01:00:24,259
How was she?

1008
01:00:29,023 --> 01:00:32,069
(laughs) That's my boy.

1009
01:00:32,069 --> 01:00:34,902
That's my fuckin' boy right there.

1010
01:00:41,535 --> 01:00:43,509
Yeah, Scarlett was a good lay tonight too.

1011
01:00:43,509 --> 01:00:44,509
(sinister music)

1012
01:00:44,509 --> 01:00:45,676
Fuckin' whore.

1013
01:00:53,772 --> 01:00:56,271

1014
01:00:56,271 --> 01:00:58,938
(Annie weeping)

1015
01:01:02,205 --> 01:01:03,038
- Mom?

1016
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:12,506
(Josh retching)

1017
01:01:19,542 --> 01:01:20,375
- Josh,

1018
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:23,076

1019
01:01:23,076 --> 01:01:25,243
- Fuck you, what happened?

1020
01:01:40,925 --> 01:01:42,010

01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:43,809
Move this shit so I can talk to you.

01:01:43,809 --> 01:01:47,182
Hey, I heard you had a

Please.

1028
01:01:54,743 --> 01:01:57,615
Let's talk about something else.

1029
01:01:57,615 --> 01:01:59,156
Cool?

1030
01:01:59,156 --> 01:01:59,989

Good luck.

1034
01:02:08,493 --> 01:02:09,910
- Gimme a minute?

1035
01:02:15,128 --> 01:02:16,887
Sierra's goin' around

1036
01:02:16,887 --> 01:02:20,137
what happened with you guys last night.

1037
01:02:23,263 --> 01:02:24,263
- I'm sorry.

1038
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:26,204
- It's okay.

1039
01:02:26,204 --> 01:02:29,037
We're not together anymore, right?

1040
01:02:30,531 --> 01:02:34,814
Look, I know what's going
on with you at home.

1041
01:02:34,814 --> 01:02:36,397
- What do you know?

1042
01:02:38,353 --> 01:02:39,436
- Everything.

1043
01:02:40,498 --> 01:02:42,581
Everyone at school knows.

1044
01:02:46,011 --> 01:02:47,844
I know it's crazy, but

1045
01:02:49,329 --> 01:02:52,246
if you need a friend I'm here okay?

1046

Okay.

1047
01:02:57,437 --> 01:02:58,687
See you around.

1048
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:05,647
- Michael?

1049
01:03:12,002 --> 01:03:14,760
- Oh no, what are you doing?

1050
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,769
- Why do even you wear this sporty shit?

1051
01:03:16,769 --> 01:03:18,680
I'm trying to find something to wear.

1052
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:20,504
- Oh no you don't, not with my clothes.

1053
01:03:20,504 --> 01:03:22,275
You are not wearing--
- Gimme that!

1054
01:03:22,275 --> 01:03:23,756
- Get outta this closet now!

1055
01:03:23,756 --> 01:03:25,920
- No, you bitch.
- Put this dress down!

1056
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:26,907
Get outta the closet!

1057
01:03:26,907 --> 01:03:28,303
You're destroying my marriage!

1058
01:03:28,303 --> 01:03:29,644
Get out!
(Lily gasping)

1059
01:03:29,644 --> 01:03:31,130
Get out right now!

1060
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:31,963
- Bitch!

1061
01:03:33,591 --> 01:03:36,516
What are you, jealous of me?

1062
01:03:36,516 --> 01:03:38,766
Nobody tells me what to do.

1063
01:03:40,067 --> 01:03:40,900
Isaac!

1064
01:03:43,364 --> 01:03:44,197
(sinister music)

1065
01:03:44,197 --> 01:03:45,607

(Annie screaming)

1066
01:03:45,607 --> 01:03:46,745
- Ow.

(fist thudding)
(Annie weeping)

1070
01:03:59,758 --> 01:04:01,508
Please don't hurt me.

1071
01:04:20,568 --> 01:04:21,401
Sofia!

1072
01:04:23,042 --> 01:04:24,209
Open the door!

1073
01:04:25,145 --> 01:04:25,978
- Oh Annie, thank God.

1074
01:04:25,978 --> 01:04:26,859
What's wrong?

1075
01:04:26,859 --> 01:04:27,974
- Look what he did to me.

1076
01:04:27,974 --> 01:04:29,495
- Oh my God, oh my God.

1077
01:04:29,495 --> 01:04:31,181
Okay, what happened?

1078
01:04:31,181 --> 01:04:32,014
- Isaac.

1079
01:04:32,856 --> 01:04:34,658
I can't live like this.

1080
01:04:34,658 --> 01:04:35,901
- I know you can't, sweetheart.

1081
01:04:35,901 --> 01:04:36,984
I'm so sorry.

1082
01:04:37,853 --> 01:04:39,968
Okay, where's Michael now?

1083
01:04:39,968 --> 01:04:42,452
- I don't know. (weeps)

1084
01:04:42,452 --> 01:04:43,694
- Okay shh, come in.

1085
01:04:43,694 --> 01:04:44,680
Come in, come on.

1086
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,191
Come on in, sweetheart.

1087
01:04:46,191 --> 01:04:47,358
Oh God, Annie!

1088
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:49,828
- So let me ask you this,

1089
01:04:49,828 --> 01:04:54,189
do you have any plans
for later on tonight?

1090
01:04:54,189 --> 01:04:56,936
- No, do you have any plans?

1091
01:04:56,936 --> 01:04:58,499
- Actually, no I don't.

1092
01:04:58,499 --> 01:05:02,139
But I could think of a
few, that's for sure.

1093
01:05:02,139 --> 01:05:05,558
- Well why don't you start
by buying me another drink?

1094
01:05:05,558 --> 01:05:07,672
(light rock music)

1095
01:05:07,672 --> 01:05:09,876
- Bartender, a Mai Tai for this

1096
01:05:09,876 --> 01:05:12,959
absolutely gorgeous creature, please.

1097
01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:15,890
- Comin' right up, sexy.

1098
01:05:20,927 --> 01:05:22,996
- Wait a minute.

1099
01:05:22,996 --> 01:05:26,163
Why am I the only woman in this place?

1100
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:31,668
- (laughs) You're a trip, you know that?

1101
01:05:31,668 --> 01:05:33,501
Really, you're a trip.

1102
01:05:34,686 --> 01:05:36,853
- This one's on the house.

1103
01:05:39,262 --> 01:05:40,322
- Cheers.

1104
01:05:40,322 --> 01:05:43,239
(glasses clinking)

1105
01:05:44,221 --> 01:05:47,392
- I feel really uncomfortable.

1106
01:05:47,392 --> 01:05:48,225
- What?

1107
01:05:48,225 --> 01:05:49,294
Hey!

1108
01:05:49,294 --> 01:05:50,368
Wait a minute.

1109
01:05:50,368 --> 01:05:52,177
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1110
01:05:52,177 --> 01:05:53,344
Wait a minute.

1111
01:05:56,496 --> 01:05:59,163
(lips smacking)

1112
01:06:06,225 --> 01:06:09,723
- Hey, I didn't say all the
drinks were on the house.

1113
01:06:09,723 --> 01:06:11,203
Jesus Christ, you give 'em an inch

1114
01:06:11,203 --> 01:06:13,620
and they take a fuckin' mile.

1115
01:06:16,254 --> 01:06:19,421
- Hey, I am going to fucking kill you!

1116
01:06:20,696 --> 01:06:24,301
(fist thudding)
(Isaac grunting)

1117
01:06:24,301 --> 01:06:26,359
Get the fuck down there!

1118
01:06:26,359 --> 01:06:27,599
Fuck you, huh!

1119
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:29,455
Fucking faggot!

1120
01:06:29,455 --> 01:06:30,983
Fucking kill you!

1121
01:06:30,983 --> 01:06:35,150
(grunts) Suck on that,
you fuckin' cocksucker!

1122
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:38,441
- Stop it.

1123
01:06:38,441 --> 01:06:39,274
- Freeze!

1124
01:06:39,274 --> 01:06:40,347
Don't you move, you son of a bitch!

1125
01:06:40,347 --> 01:06:41,561
Put your hands up now!

1126
01:06:41,561 --> 01:06:44,770
Put 'em up where I can see 'em.

1127
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:46,882
(cop mumbling)

1128
01:06:46,882 --> 01:06:49,577
- The fuck are you gonna do to me, huh?

1129
01:06:49,577 --> 01:06:50,410
Yeah.

1130
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:52,743
- Hands where I can see 'em!

1131
01:06:56,116 --> 01:06:59,277
- The fuck are you gonna do to me, huh?

1132
01:06:59,277 --> 01:07:03,241
(cop breathing heavily)

1133
01:07:03,241 --> 01:07:04,074
Fuck off.

1134
01:07:04,942 --> 01:07:07,850
(foreboding music)

1135
01:07:07,850 --> 01:07:09,889
Sir, are you okay?

1136
01:07:09,889 --> 01:07:11,463
Sir, can you hear me?

1137
01:07:11,463 --> 01:07:13,112
Don't worry sir, I'm
gonna get you some help.

1138
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:14,987
Don't move, don't move, don't move.

1139
01:07:14,987 --> 01:07:17,237
You've lost a lot of blood.

1140
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:20,920
- Isaac, what did you do?

1141
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,620
What did you do to him?

1142
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:25,081
- What were you doing with that man?

1143
01:07:25,081 --> 01:07:26,057
- It's none of your--

1144
01:07:26,057 --> 01:07:27,138
(Lily screaming)

1145
01:07:27,138 --> 01:07:28,755
- What were you doing with him?

1146
01:07:28,755 --> 01:07:30,771
- I'm gonna tell Michael
what you're doing to me!

1147
01:07:30,771 --> 01:07:31,984
Let go of me!
- Yeah?

1148
01:07:31,984 --> 01:07:33,908
Tell Michael, you bitch!
- Let go of me.

1149
01:07:33,908 --> 01:07:38,174
- I will tell Michael that
you are fucking another man!

1150
01:07:38,174 --> 01:07:42,176
You fucking slut!
(Lily screaming)

1151
01:07:42,176 --> 01:07:44,843
(phone dialing)

1152
01:07:46,265 --> 01:07:47,933
- Annie, it's Sofia.

1153
01:07:47,933 --> 01:07:49,532
Sweetheart, where are you?

1154
01:07:49,532 --> 01:07:53,699
Please answer your phone. (sighs)

1155
01:08:00,144 --> 01:08:03,144
(muffled crosstalk)

1156
01:08:05,444 --> 01:08:06,277
Michael?

1157
01:08:08,483 --> 01:08:10,150
Where have you been?

1158
01:08:12,745 --> 01:08:16,245
- I don't know (mumbles).

1159
01:08:20,279 --> 01:08:22,858
Michael, Isaac is out of control.

1160
01:08:22,858 --> 01:08:24,108
Get in the car.

1161
01:08:27,205 --> 01:08:28,455
Get in the car.

1162
01:08:45,964 --> 01:08:48,714
Come on Michael, let's go inside.

1163
01:08:54,786 --> 01:08:56,650
- I want you to do me a favor.

1164
01:08:56,650 --> 01:08:58,590
I want you to go out this door

1165
01:08:58,590 --> 01:09:00,487
and don't let Isaac in the house.

1166
01:09:00,487 --> 01:09:02,212
No matter what, you understand?

1167
01:09:02,212 --> 01:09:03,462
No matter what.

1168
01:09:09,802 --> 01:09:11,302
- You got it, son.

1169
01:09:13,955 --> 01:09:16,065
- [Josh] What's going on now?

1170
01:09:16,065 --> 01:09:18,982
- I'm talking to your father alone.

1171
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,409
- Oh my God, what
happened to your face mom?

1172
01:09:29,409 --> 01:09:31,492
- Nothing Josh, I'm fine.

1173
01:09:32,987 --> 01:09:34,987
- Here, now have a seat.

1174
01:09:40,594 --> 01:09:41,677
There you go.

1175
01:09:42,883 --> 01:09:43,883
Have a seat.

1176
01:09:49,510 --> 01:09:52,312
What are you lookin' at?

1177
01:09:52,312 --> 01:09:55,645
(soft entrancing music)

1178
01:09:58,194 --> 01:09:59,353
- Nothin'.

1179
01:09:59,353 --> 01:10:01,686
- Okay, how are you feeling?

1180
01:10:03,228 --> 01:10:06,145
- (exhales) Tired.

1181
01:10:07,312 --> 01:10:11,479
- Why did you ask your father,
Lou, to guard the door?

1182
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:18,847
- I don't want Isaac coming
into my house anymore.

1183
01:10:19,755 --> 01:10:22,255
- And what is Lou goin' to do?

1184
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:31,113
- Help, help, help!

1185
01:10:32,318 --> 01:10:33,235
No, no, no.

1186
01:10:36,817 --> 01:10:38,817
- Isaac, get outta here.

1187
01:10:39,997 --> 01:10:41,759
- The fuck are you?

1188
01:10:41,759 --> 01:10:43,710
- I'm Michael's father.

1189
01:10:43,710 --> 01:10:47,374
- (laughs) Oh, is that so?

1190
01:10:47,374 --> 01:10:49,347
Well Scarlet told me all about you.

1191
01:10:49,347 --> 01:10:51,338
Get the fuck outta here, old man!

1192
01:10:51,338 --> 01:10:54,025
- I'm here to protect my son.

1193
01:10:54,025 --> 01:10:57,072
- Well it's too late for that.

1194
01:10:57,072 --> 01:10:58,849
(ominous music)

1195
01:10:58,849 --> 01:11:02,984
(laughs) You fucking kidding me right now?

1196
01:11:02,984 --> 01:11:06,317
You think I'm gonna let you just cut me?

1197
01:11:07,669 --> 01:11:09,669
- Isaac, I said get out.

1198
01:11:11,981 --> 01:11:16,148
- I will fucking kill you. (grunts)

1199
01:11:20,174 --> 01:11:22,841
(Isaac wincing)

1200
01:11:44,183 --> 01:11:47,433
- Michael, what do you keep looking at?

1201
01:11:49,059 --> 01:11:50,676
- Michael, it's Isaac.

1202
01:11:50,676 --> 01:11:52,535
He's angry and he tried to kill me.

1203
01:11:52,535 --> 01:11:53,931
- Lily, get out of here.

1204
01:11:53,931 --> 01:11:55,861
- [Michael] No, no, she can't leave.

1205
01:11:55,861 --> 01:11:57,245
Lily can't leave.

1206
01:11:57,245 --> 01:11:58,692
- You want her here?

1207
01:11:58,692 --> 01:11:59,664
- Michael.

1208
01:11:59,664 --> 01:12:01,331
I love you, Michael.

1209
01:12:02,175 --> 01:12:04,588
- What about Annie?

1210
01:12:04,588 --> 01:12:07,749
She's your wife now and she loves you.

1211
01:12:07,749 --> 01:12:10,699
- God, I know I know I know I know I know.

1212
01:12:10,699 --> 01:12:12,640
I can't let Lily go.

1213
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:13,473
I just can't.

1214
01:12:13,473 --> 01:12:14,777
- Thank you, Michael.

1215
01:12:14,777 --> 01:12:15,687
Thank you.

1216
01:12:15,687 --> 01:12:17,437
Don't ever let me go.

1217
01:12:18,945 --> 01:12:23,181
- Your wife and your son
are downstairs right now

1218
01:12:23,181 --> 01:12:24,578
and they love you.

1219
01:12:24,578 --> 01:12:27,250
So don't do this, Michael.

1220
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:28,787
- I love you too, Michael.

1221
01:12:28,787 --> 01:12:31,163
You know that, don't you?

1222
01:12:31,163 --> 01:12:34,073
- Not the way Annie loves you.

1223
01:12:34,073 --> 01:12:37,287
Lily never loved you as
much as Annie loves you.

1224
01:12:37,287 --> 01:12:39,573
That's what you know, Michael.

1225
01:12:39,573 --> 01:12:41,823
So get her outta your life.

1226
01:12:42,811 --> 01:12:45,239
Get them all out of your life.

1227
01:12:45,239 --> 01:12:47,160
They're destroying your marriage.

1228
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:48,358
They're destroying your life.

1229
01:12:48,358 --> 01:12:50,695
(Michael weeping)

1230
01:12:50,695 --> 01:12:51,612
- Madeline,

1231
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:55,602
look what a mess you made.

1232
01:12:56,573 --> 01:13:01,463
You take the cake for the
world worst mother, dumb woman!

1233
01:13:01,463 --> 01:13:04,963
If you needed more sex, I was right there!

1234
01:13:06,575 --> 01:13:07,408
Why,

1235
01:13:08,374 --> 01:13:09,374
why the boy?

1236
01:13:11,295 --> 01:13:13,694
Poor little Michael.

1237
01:13:13,694 --> 01:13:17,669
Now he got all this crazy
fucker running around

1238
01:13:17,669 --> 01:13:21,836
and I have to be here because
of you to get the best!

1239
01:13:27,410 --> 01:13:28,743
Oh, sweet Annie.

1240
01:13:30,097 --> 01:13:32,371
She doesn't deserve this

1241
01:13:32,371 --> 01:13:34,954
and I shouldn't be here either!

1242
01:13:37,341 --> 01:13:38,591
Sofia is right.

1243
01:13:40,593 --> 01:13:43,610
- Michael please, don't listen to Sofia.

1244
01:13:43,610 --> 01:13:44,796
I love you.

1245
01:13:44,796 --> 01:13:46,406
You can't let me go.

1246
01:13:46,406 --> 01:13:49,317
- Oh God, I don't know what to do!

1247
01:13:49,317 --> 01:13:51,644
- Cry me a fuckin' river.

1248
01:13:51,644 --> 01:13:53,407
- Isaac!
- Shut up!

1249
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:54,824
Shut the fuck up!

1250
01:13:57,930 --> 01:14:00,590
- (gasps) Isaac, what are
you going to do to me?

1251
01:14:00,590 --> 01:14:03,292
- I'll tell you what I'm gonna
do to you, you sick bitch.

1252
01:14:03,292 --> 01:14:04,143
I'm gonna blow your fuckin' head off!

1253
01:14:04,143 --> 01:14:05,950
- Isaac, let her go.

1254
01:14:05,950 --> 01:14:07,321
- No!

1255
01:14:07,321 --> 01:14:08,858
I know what she's tryin' to do.

1256
01:14:08,858 --> 01:14:10,944
Tryin' to convince you to
get me outta here, right?

1257
01:14:10,944 --> 01:14:12,391
Right, Michael?

1258
01:14:12,391 --> 01:14:14,724
Well I'm not goin' anywhere!

1259
01:14:15,681 --> 01:14:18,318
- Isaac, what do you want us all to do?

1260
01:14:18,318 --> 01:14:19,880
- Didn't you hear what I said?

1261
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:22,513
All of you, you're all
gonna get the fuck out!

1262
01:14:22,513 --> 01:14:23,914
Tryin' to get me out?

1263
01:14:23,914 --> 01:14:25,376
No, this is my house.

1264
01:14:25,376 --> 01:14:27,001
You hear me?

1265
01:14:27,001 --> 01:14:29,204
This is my life now!

1266
01:14:29,204 --> 01:14:31,240
- Yes Isaac, I hear you.

1267
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:33,578
We all hear you and
we're all going to leave

1268
01:14:33,578 --> 01:14:35,351
if you just let me go, please.

1269
01:14:35,351 --> 01:14:38,105
- No, get rid of him Michael.

1270
01:14:38,105 --> 01:14:39,569
You don't want him here.

1271
01:14:39,569 --> 01:14:41,020
- You fuckin' stay out of this, old man!

1272
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:44,052
You stay out!
- I said let her go!

1273
01:14:44,052 --> 01:14:46,515
(eerie music)

1274
01:14:46,515 --> 01:14:48,238
(gun blasting)
(Lily wincing)

1275
01:14:48,238 --> 01:14:49,155
- No, Lily!

1276
01:14:51,770 --> 01:14:53,018
God!

1277
01:14:53,018 --> 01:14:53,851
Oh my God, Lily.

1278
01:14:53,851 --> 01:14:55,570
Lily, oh no.

1279
01:14:55,570 --> 01:14:57,006
(Lily groaning)

1280
01:14:57,006 --> 01:14:58,341
No don't die on me.

1281
01:14:58,341 --> 01:15:00,127
Oh God, Lily don't.

1282
01:15:00,127 --> 01:15:00,960
Please don't go.

1283
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,168
Please don't leave me.

1284
01:15:02,168 --> 01:15:03,126
Please.

1285
01:15:03,126 --> 01:15:04,218
Please don't leave me.

1286
01:15:04,218 --> 01:15:06,129
- Son of a bitch!

1287
01:15:06,129 --> 01:15:10,296
(ominous music)
(Isaac grunting)

1288
01:15:14,053 --> 01:15:18,220
(Isaac wincing)
(blood spurting)

1289
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:22,172
- Oh God, Lily please don't go.

1290
01:15:22,172 --> 01:15:24,339
Please, please don't leave me.

1291
01:15:24,339 --> 01:15:26,901
Please, please, please don't.

1292
01:15:26,901 --> 01:15:29,476
- I love you. (pants)

1293
01:15:29,476 --> 01:15:30,987
- Please, you can't leave me.

1294
01:15:30,987 --> 01:15:33,570
(Lily wincing)

1295
01:15:35,195 --> 01:15:37,588
- Listen to your father.

1296
01:15:37,588 --> 01:15:38,988
It's too late.

1297
01:15:38,988 --> 01:15:40,260
- I love you, Lily.

1298
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:41,925
I love you, Lily.

1299
01:15:41,925 --> 01:15:43,164
Don't leave me.

1300
01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:45,350
Don't leave me, please.

1301
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:46,850
- We had our days.

1302
01:15:47,996 --> 01:15:49,897
I love you, Michael.

1303
01:15:49,897 --> 01:15:52,071
- She's not gonna make it.

1304
01:15:52,071 --> 01:15:53,969
- Yes she is, don't say that.

1305
01:15:53,969 --> 01:15:55,860
Don't fuckin' say that.

1306
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:58,527
(Lily mumbling)

1307
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:03,474
Annie is your wife now.

1308
01:16:04,673 --> 01:16:07,387
I can't stay. (weeps)

1309
01:16:07,387 --> 01:16:08,304
I gotta go.

1310
01:16:12,667 --> 01:16:16,117
(Lily mumbling)

1311
01:16:16,117 --> 01:16:18,984
- Don't, no. (weeps)

1312
01:16:18,984 --> 01:16:19,817
Oh God.

1313
01:16:21,719 --> 01:16:25,370
- It's so peaceful.
- You're gonna be alright.

1314
01:16:25,370 --> 01:16:27,037
- It is so peaceful.

1315
01:16:39,715 --> 01:16:43,548
- (weeps) No, don't leave me.

1316
01:16:46,137 --> 01:16:46,970
Don't leave.

1317
01:16:46,970 --> 01:16:48,330
You can't leave me.

1318
01:16:48,330 --> 01:16:50,094
Please, please, Lily.

1319
01:16:50,094 --> 01:16:51,491
Please stay, please stay with me.

1320
01:16:51,491 --> 01:16:52,408
I love you.

1321
01:16:54,125 --> 01:16:56,792
- Jesse, what are you afraid of?

1322
01:16:59,625 --> 01:17:00,875
- I don't know.

1323
01:17:03,332 --> 01:17:05,594
(ominous music)

1324
01:17:05,594 --> 01:17:08,511
- Michael doesn't need you anymore.

1325
01:17:26,261 --> 01:17:28,844
(gun blasting)

1326
01:17:34,668 --> 01:17:37,751
(soft, somber music)

1327
01:17:57,243 --> 01:18:01,410
- (gasps) What are you doin' here?

1328
01:18:02,833 --> 01:18:06,583
- Your mother's loss is
my loss too, Michael.

1329
01:18:08,270 --> 01:18:10,549
- (chuckles) What?

1330
01:18:10,549 --> 01:18:12,216
You never loved her.

1331
01:18:13,076 --> 01:18:15,380
Just get outta here, huh?

1332
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:17,673
I have a family emergency.

1333
01:18:17,673 --> 01:18:19,445
I'm gonna have to call off this meeting.

1334
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:20,574
I'm sorry.

1335
01:18:20,574 --> 01:18:23,824
- No, let us continue this meeting now.

1336
01:18:25,090 --> 01:18:26,814
- I said, no!

1337
01:18:26,814 --> 01:18:28,306
I can do it.

1338
01:18:28,306 --> 01:18:31,826
Just leave me the fuck
alone and get outta my life!

1339
01:18:31,826 --> 01:18:33,439
You hear me?

1340
01:18:33,439 --> 01:18:34,414
Get out of my life!

1341
01:18:34,414 --> 01:18:35,926
Get outta my car!

1342
01:18:35,926 --> 01:18:37,202
Get outta my car!

1343
01:18:37,202 --> 01:18:39,202
I want you outta my car!

1344
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:43,245
- [Sofia] Oh they're
simple questions, Jesse.

1345
01:18:43,245 --> 01:18:44,245
- Like what?

1346
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:49,726
- {Sofia] Well, I wanna know
when you plan on leaving.

1347
01:18:49,726 --> 01:18:51,393
- No, I can't leave.

1348
01:18:53,767 --> 01:18:55,915
I can't, Michael needs me.

1349
01:18:55,915 --> 01:18:57,659
- I said get outta my closet!

1350
01:18:57,659 --> 01:18:58,492
- What do you doin'?

1351
01:18:58,492 --> 01:18:59,325
You crazy!

1352
01:18:59,325 --> 01:19:00,158
- You're ruining my marriage.

1353
01:19:00,158 --> 01:19:00,991
Get out!

1354
01:19:00,991 --> 01:19:01,824
- You stupid bitch!
- Get outta here!

1355
01:19:01,824 --> 01:19:03,110
Get outta my life!

1356
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:05,110
- What are you, jealous?

1357
01:19:07,178 --> 01:19:10,152
- Shut up, shut the fuck up!

1358
01:19:10,152 --> 01:19:12,572
- Isaac, what are you going to do to me?

1359
01:19:12,572 --> 01:19:14,736
- I'll tell you what I'm gonna
do to you, you sick bitch.

1360
01:19:14,736 --> 01:19:17,819
I'm gonna blow your fuckin' head off!

1361
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:21,860
- [Sofia] Michael?

1362
01:19:25,658 --> 01:19:26,491
- Sofia.

1363
01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:30,830
- How do you feel?

1364
01:19:33,897 --> 01:19:36,172
- Something happened last night.

1365
01:19:36,172 --> 01:19:38,733
- [Sofia] What happened?

1366
01:19:38,733 --> 01:19:39,733
- I can't...

1367
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:43,087
I don't remember.

1368
01:19:44,493 --> 01:19:46,818
- It's okay, Michael.

1369
01:19:46,818 --> 01:19:48,691
They're all gone.

1370
01:19:48,691 --> 01:19:50,858
It's all gonna be alright.

1371
01:19:55,115 --> 01:19:56,411
Baby.

1372
01:19:56,411 --> 01:19:57,930
Son.

1373
01:19:57,930 --> 01:19:59,249
You're alive.

1374
01:19:59,249 --> 01:20:02,165
(Michael mumbling)

1375
01:20:02,165 --> 01:20:04,296
- [Sofia] You're home, Michael.

1376
01:20:04,296 --> 01:20:06,713
- I am.
- You're finally home.

1377
01:20:07,774 --> 01:20:10,274
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1378
01:20:12,626 --> 01:20:13,459
Oh boy.

1379
01:20:14,588 --> 01:20:17,288
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1380
01:20:17,288 --> 01:20:18,288
- Thank you.

1381
01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:22,433
- It's only our first meal here (mumbles).

1382
01:20:22,433 --> 01:20:26,798
Anyway, the doggie says
to the zebra, right.

1383
01:20:26,798 --> 01:20:27,982
He says, he goes up.

1384
01:20:27,982 --> 01:20:30,774
He doesn't speak English and everybody...

1385
01:20:30,774 --> 01:20:31,909
(mumbles) okay and everybody.

1386
01:20:31,909 --> 01:20:35,826
We don't like paper plates
and 89 cent Chianti.

1387
01:20:36,787 --> 01:20:38,237
(muffled crosstalk)

1388
01:20:38,237 --> 01:20:39,070
You like it?

1389
01:20:39,070 --> 01:20:39,966
- It's not even.

1390
01:20:39,966 --> 01:20:42,428
- (mumbles) like it, but at
least we have a nice house.

1391
01:20:42,428 --> 01:20:44,666
At least we have a nice house, yes?

1392
01:20:44,666 --> 01:20:45,666
- Let's make a toast to the...

1393
01:20:45,666 --> 01:20:47,826
Your house is absolutely gorgeous.

1394
01:20:47,826 --> 01:20:50,147
- Thank you, Roger.
- Very gorgeous.

1395
01:20:50,147 --> 01:20:52,198
- Honey, I'm gonna go
and check on Sofia, okay?

1396
01:20:52,198 --> 01:20:53,106
- Okay, baby.

1397
01:20:53,106 --> 01:20:54,939
- Okay, be right back.

1398
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:00,903
Sofia?
- Hey.

1399
01:21:00,903 --> 01:21:01,839
- You doin' alright?

1400
01:21:01,839 --> 01:21:03,853
Yeah, I'm doin' great.
- Good.

1401
01:21:03,853 --> 01:21:04,815
- Michael's co-worker is right.

1402
01:21:04,815 --> 01:21:06,218
Your house is perfect.

1403
01:21:06,218 --> 01:21:07,916
- Well thank you.

1404
01:21:07,916 --> 01:21:10,448
I've gotta say, Bernadette
worked really hard

1405
01:21:10,448 --> 01:21:11,677
to get us outta that other house

1406
01:21:11,677 --> 01:21:13,347
and put us into this one.

1407
01:21:13,347 --> 01:21:14,690
- Are you happy?

1408
01:21:14,690 --> 01:21:15,857
- Very.
- Good.

1409
01:21:18,473 --> 01:21:22,182
I want you to know that I won't
be seeing Michael anymore.

1410
01:21:22,182 --> 01:21:24,255
- Really, why is that?

1411
01:21:24,255 --> 01:21:26,243
- Well he's going to work tomorrow.

1412
01:21:26,243 --> 01:21:29,326
He doesn't need me, wouldn't you say?

1413
01:21:31,368 --> 01:21:35,535
- (sighs) Actually I have
to say that I do agree.

1414
01:21:38,591 --> 01:21:41,028
You're an incredible doctor.
- No.

1415
01:21:41,028 --> 01:21:42,717
- You really are.

1416
01:21:42,717 --> 01:21:45,613
I wanna ask you something.

1417
01:21:45,613 --> 01:21:47,875
Tell me, how did you do this?

1418
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:52,270
How did you get him out
of this difficult period?

1419
01:21:52,270 --> 01:21:55,581
- Michael's childhood
tragedy, the molestation,

1420
01:21:55,581 --> 01:21:59,446
it brought forth all these
multiple personalities.

1421
01:21:59,446 --> 01:22:02,844
But the thing is, every single alter ego

1422
01:22:02,844 --> 01:22:05,194
had a purpose for being here.

1423
01:22:05,194 --> 01:22:07,861
Like Lou, he was his protection.

1424
01:22:08,702 --> 01:22:10,869
The gatekeeper as it were.

1425
01:22:12,169 --> 01:22:16,357
Lily, she was the affection
that he yearned for.

1426
01:22:16,357 --> 01:22:19,098
In his heart, he felt like
he had unfinished business

1427
01:22:19,098 --> 01:22:21,109
with Lily, his deceased wife.

1428
01:22:21,109 --> 01:22:23,026
So he brought her back.

1429
01:22:24,299 --> 01:22:26,323
Then there was Jesse.

1430
01:22:26,323 --> 01:22:27,823
Poor little Jesse.

1431
01:22:29,126 --> 01:22:33,293
This timid and scared little
boy inside of Michael.

1432
01:22:35,337 --> 01:22:37,437
Then there was Isaac.

1433
01:22:37,437 --> 01:22:39,524
- [Annie] Oh, that was horrible.

1434
01:22:39,524 --> 01:22:43,151
- Isaac was the one who
made him feel strong

1435
01:22:43,151 --> 01:22:45,568
and in control, intimidating.

1436
01:22:47,689 --> 01:22:50,585
Once he realized that he didn't
need all these personalities

1437
01:22:50,585 --> 01:22:55,234
to complete him, the part of
his mind that created them

1438
01:22:55,234 --> 01:22:56,567
killed them off.

1439
01:22:58,669 --> 01:23:00,456
- Wow.
- And it was the love

1440
01:23:00,456 --> 01:23:04,623
that he had for his family
that helped him do that.

1441
01:23:05,803 --> 01:23:07,304
- Thank you so much.

1442
01:23:07,304 --> 01:23:09,545
- You're welcome.

1443
01:23:09,545 --> 01:23:13,245
- You brought my husband back to me.

1444
01:23:13,245 --> 01:23:15,578
- I'm very proud of Michael.

1445
01:23:17,593 --> 01:23:19,010
- Aww, thank you.

1446
01:23:25,295 --> 01:23:28,462
- Michael, I'm here 'cause I love you.

1447
01:23:33,908 --> 01:23:38,075
I'm very sorry about what
happened to you as a kid.

1448
01:23:40,631 --> 01:23:41,464
- So am I.

1449
01:23:44,567 --> 01:23:46,652
But that means a lot to me.

1450
01:23:46,652 --> 01:23:47,735
- You got it.

1451
01:23:52,967 --> 01:23:53,800
- Thanks.

1452
01:23:59,548 --> 01:24:02,512
Hey chief, I wanna show you something.

1453
01:24:02,512 --> 01:24:03,929
- He's one of us.

1454
01:24:05,016 --> 01:24:07,943
- Hey sports fan, stand up.

1455
01:24:07,943 --> 01:24:10,026
- Huh?
- Come on, come on.

1456
01:24:11,687 --> 01:24:14,770
(soft, somber music)

1457
01:24:17,605 --> 01:24:19,708
(muffled conversation)
(Myra laughing)

1458
01:24:19,708 --> 01:24:21,414
Good talk, you can talk (mumbles).

1459
01:24:21,414 --> 01:24:22,247
- You sure can.

1460
01:24:22,247 --> 01:24:23,357
- Thanks for your help today, Myra.

1461
01:24:23,357 --> 01:24:24,567
- You're very welcome.
- Alright.

1462
01:24:24,567 --> 01:24:25,924
- Have a good night, Mr Foster.

1463
01:24:25,924 --> 01:24:28,424
- I'll see ya tomorrow.
- Okay.

1464
01:24:29,674 --> 01:24:32,591
(elevator dinging)

1465
01:24:34,146 --> 01:24:35,659
- Hold the elevator, please.

1466
01:24:35,659 --> 01:24:36,834
Hold up.

1467
01:24:36,834 --> 01:24:37,667
Thank you.

1468
01:24:45,044 --> 01:24:47,095
That's you, wasn't it?

1469
01:24:47,095 --> 01:24:47,928
- What?

1470
01:24:49,956 --> 01:24:52,706
- My special friend from the bar.

1471
01:24:54,095 --> 01:24:56,619
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.

1472
01:24:56,619 --> 01:24:59,321
- This may seem a little crazy to you, but

1473
01:24:59,321 --> 01:25:02,093
besides bashing my head up
against a brick building

1474
01:25:02,093 --> 01:25:06,260
and scarring me for life,
you did something to me.

1475
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:09,998
(rhythmic pop music)

1476
01:25:09,998 --> 01:25:13,165
Yeah, I can't stop thinking about you.

1477
01:25:15,656 --> 01:25:17,459
Okay wait a minute, look look.

1478
01:25:17,459 --> 01:25:18,967
I would like you to know

1479
01:25:18,967 --> 01:25:20,400
if you wanted to get together again

1480
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,612
and not be so rough this time,

1481
01:25:22,612 --> 01:25:25,195
I would really like to see you.

1482
01:25:26,107 --> 01:25:28,657
- I'm happily married.

1483
01:25:28,657 --> 01:25:31,915
- (chuckles) Come on, aren't we all?

1484
01:25:31,915 --> 01:25:32,748
- No.

1485
01:25:35,313 --> 01:25:36,146
Naw.

1486
01:25:44,455 --> 01:25:47,622
(dark rhythmic music)

1487
01:27:59,905 --> 01:28:03,322
(ominous rhythmic music)

1488
01:29:23,391 --> 01:29:26,808
(soft synthesizer music)
