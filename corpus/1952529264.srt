00:03:08,053 --> 00:03:09,611
Okay, Mom.

7
00:04:34,305 --> 00:04:36,034
Yes, sir.

8
00:04:36,074 --> 00:04:40,238
I bet you ask if I will ever
tired of milking, is not it?

9
00:04:42,614 --> 00:04:47,412
Here you go. Try this.
Thus you will be much better.

10
00:04:47,418 --> 00:04:51,218
Yes, sir.

11
00:04:51,256 --> 00:04:53,554
You know what just

12
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:56,059
Can I take
one of those machines ...

13
00:04:56,094 --> 00:04:58,927
that sucking a cow to death ......

14
00:04:58,963 --> 00:05:01,625
especially old cow like you.

15
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:08,366
Yes! What do you think?

16
00:05:36,768 --> 00:05:38,258
Good morning, Robert!

17
00:06:07,398 --> 00:06:09,366
Ok, Ok! Go to class!

18
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,867

00:06:17,108 --> 00:06:18,939
Good morning! Good morning!

21
00:06:20,044 --> 00:06:24,344
Megan, where are you going?

22
00:06:24,382 --> 00:06:26,407
Megan!

23
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:27,918
Thank you!

24
00:06:27,952 --> 00:06:30,386
Hey, want to trade?

25
00:06:30,421 --> 00:06:31,888
Not in this lifetime!

26
00:06:34,525 --> 00:06:36,720
Tonight, with you
or with me?

27
00:06:36,761 --> 00:06:38,228
With me.

28
00:06:38,263 --> 00:06:40,595
Have a nice day.
- You too.

29
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:45,027
Well, sit everyone down.

30
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:46,661
Sit in your place.

31
00:06:50,441 --> 00:06:52,705
I promise to be faithful to the flag ...

32
00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:55,679
United States ...

33
00:06:55,713 --> 00:07:00,341
and the republics of the people behind them.

34
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:03,286
I know you've all heard about
possible closure of schools ...

35
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:05,289
the possibility
closing schools ...

36
00:07:05,323 --> 00:07:07,757
at the end of this term.

37
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:10,124
For non-graduates, and this
most of you, it would mean ....

38
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:15,326
and that most of you, it would mean ....

39
00:07:16,868 --> 00:07:20,395
"There was once a beautiful girl
whose father was a miller. "

40
00:07:20,438 --> 00:07:21,735
I tried to tell them ...

41
00:07:21,773 --> 00:07:23,536
not to teach the group
Rhodes Scholar.

42
00:07:23,574 --> 00:07:27,032
But, obviously, the school board
has more confidence in you.

43
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:31,548
All this has not been officially ...

44
00:07:31,582 --> 00:07:33,550
to the school board meeting
next week ...

45
00:07:33,584 --> 00:07:38,685
When will I be able to formally
introduce the arguments against.

46
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:45,528
As we all know, is always
best to think ahead.

47
00:07:47,498 --> 00:07:48,988
Well, now.

48
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:55,202
Who would you be able to be?
- Catherine ... Wheeler.

49
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:59,107
Well, Catherine Wheeler,
go in and shut the door.

50
00:08:09,387 --> 00:08:13,187
I do not see your name
on this list.

51
00:08:13,224 --> 00:08:16,591
What grade you, Catherine?
... I'm finishing.

52
00:08:16,627 --> 00:08:18,094
Final.

53
00:08:20,298 --> 00:08:22,926
Well, welcome Hovardsvil.

54
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:26,232
You will see that this
very nice place ...

55
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,398
and if you or your family
need help ...

56
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,800
feel free to ask.
- Thanks.

57
00:08:33,811 --> 00:08:36,177
Now, sitting there on the
a vacancy.

58
00:08:44,088 --> 00:08:46,318
I would start today
with our history.

59
00:08:46,357 --> 00:08:49,656
Get the book and open
Page, uh ...

60
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,863
You two should not be
to work so late.

61
00:09:00,905 --> 00:09:03,635
Just to finish
schedule of duties.

62
00:09:03,674 --> 00:09:06,370
We will not for long.

63
00:09:06,411 --> 00:09:08,345
Good night, Mom.

64
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:10,244
Sleep good, baby.

65
00:09:10,281 --> 00:09:13,250
Good night, Robert.
- Good night, sir.

66
00:09:13,284 --> 00:09:15,718
Well, I will go to bed.

67
00:09:15,753 --> 00:09:17,186
Good night, Lily.

68
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:19,416
Good night, Lily.

69
00:09:22,693 --> 00:09:27,554
Well, another year,
last, it seems.

70
00:09:27,632 --> 00:09:30,601
It was bound to happen eventually.
This is called progress.

71
00:09:30,635 --> 00:09:32,933
How is that progressive
for thirty children ...

72
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,564
to travel sixty miles each day?

73
00:09:35,606 --> 00:09:39,406
Speaking of that,
if you take the job?

74
00:09:39,444 --> 00:09:41,309
I do not believe.

75
00:09:41,345 --> 00:09:45,076
I thought I could be
replacement or something.

76
00:09:45,116 --> 00:09:46,708
What do you think?

77
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,311
I think we should
do what you want.

78
00:09:51,489 --> 00:09:54,458
Can we talk about
farming here?

79
00:09:54,492 --> 00:09:58,719
What about it?
- Joseph.

80
00:09:58,763 --> 00:10:00,526
This is old news, Rosalie.

81
00:10:00,565 --> 00:10:02,396
What do you want to do ...

82
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:06,233
to work in two places
as you wish Lily and my mom?

83
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,330
To nurture corn in one.
a strain on the second.

84
00:10:09,373 --> 00:10:12,900
They always use the
to influence me.

85
00:10:12,944 --> 00:10:14,434
I think they are afraid ...

86
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:17,175
that if you lose your job to start ...

87
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,309
you know ... to drink, not to marry me.

88
00:10:21,886 --> 00:10:25,344
Maybe I should not find
another ...

89
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:29,155
But six years I'm with you.
- Just like me.

90
00:10:29,227 --> 00:10:31,127
You only have to solve.

91
00:10:31,162 --> 00:10:35,724
I decided about six
years. You're a little slow.

92
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:38,030
What will change
if you get married?

93
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:41,436
I do not want to live here
with Orinovom mother.

94
00:10:41,472 --> 00:10:44,771
You do not want to go out
This beautiful home in our own.

95
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:47,778
Of course I would.
I would go tomorrow.

96
00:10:50,581 --> 00:10:53,345
Robert goes to college.

97
00:10:56,787 --> 00:11:00,985
Better to go home.
This will finish later.

98
00:11:01,092 --> 00:11:03,151
Will you not here to prenociš?

99
00:11:03,194 --> 00:11:06,925
I have to see my mother.

100
00:11:06,964 --> 00:11:09,489
He did not feel well.

101
00:11:31,856 --> 00:11:34,017
What happened to your father?

102
00:11:35,293 --> 00:11:38,023
Korea. He was killed in the war.

103
00:11:39,764 --> 00:11:42,460
Mr. Svenden is your stepfather?

104
00:11:44,302 --> 00:11:48,661
It is not. He just fucks my
mother, that's all.

105
00:11:48,673 --> 00:11:50,538
Come on, Robert.

106
00:11:51,909 --> 00:11:53,467
See you later.

107
00:12:19,804 --> 00:12:21,704
Sir Svenden.

108
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:26,704
Nathan Wheeler, a retired major.

109
00:12:26,744 --> 00:12:29,736
I guess you heard,
I'm your new neighbor.

110
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,907
Am. In this region ...

111
00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:36,215
to anyone who lives in
radius of 20 miles.

112
00:12:36,253 --> 00:12:39,120
I believe you've met
my daughter, Catherine.

113
00:12:39,156 --> 00:12:40,953
Yes, sir, I did.

114
00:12:42,093 --> 00:12:45,119
How are you today, Catherine?
- Well, thank you.

115
00:12:45,162 --> 00:12:47,756
That reminds me, her
documents arrive today.

116
00:12:47,798 --> 00:12:50,733
So, it will have them on Monday,
if you agree.

117
00:12:50,768 --> 00:12:52,201
That's just fine.

118
00:12:52,236 --> 00:12:55,870
Also, I would like to ask you ...
to accommodate Ketrininog horse.

119
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,500
Adelman house has a barn.

120
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:00,066
I spoke earlier
with others. Evans ...

121
00:13:00,111 --> 00:13:02,306
and he suggested that
if you're ok ...

122
00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:03,745
make arrangements
for a fee.

123
00:13:03,781 --> 00:13:05,681
I could pay you,
say, $ 175 per month.

124
00:13:05,716 --> 00:13:07,411
Is that fair?

125
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:11,182
It is quite ...
OK, Major.

126
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,625
Thank you.
I'm going to take it out.

127
00:13:19,096 --> 00:13:21,860
S. .. V. .. E. .. N. .. D. .. E. .. N.

128
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:23,924
Is that a Norwegian or Swedish?

129
00:13:23,968 --> 00:13:25,959
Oh, it's Swedish.

130
00:13:27,605 --> 00:13:29,072
- Please.
- Thanks.

131
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:32,075
- I am very grateful to you, sir.
- Oh, thank you.

132
00:13:32,109 --> 00:13:35,567
Honey, I think that we have
time now for it.

133
00:13:35,613 --> 00:13:38,343
Can I switch to the
to your home, Major.

134
00:13:38,382 --> 00:13:40,976
Anyway, I later
to pass that way.

135
00:13:41,018 --> 00:13:42,349
Oh, come on. Please, Dad?

136
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:44,854
... If this is not the problem.
- No, not at all a problem.

137
00:13:46,157 --> 00:13:49,786
Catherine, when Mr. Svenden be
ready to go, come home.

138
00:13:49,827 --> 00:13:52,796
- Do you hear?
- Yes, I hear.

139
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,559
OK. Thank you, sir.

140
00:14:53,725 --> 00:14:55,022
Is it all right here?

141
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,255
Of course. Good.

142
00:15:08,206 --> 00:15:12,074
My father would have paid and
$ 200 per month.

143
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,577
I know.

144
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,946
Whether it could come
every day to riding?

145
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:24,012
Of course. Come whenever you want.
You do not need the key.

146
00:15:24,055 --> 00:15:28,287
I love that song by
you read yesterday, from Keats.

147
00:15:28,326 --> 00:15:31,489
Do you prefer
by Emily Dickinson?

148
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:37,961
What do you think?

149
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:40,403
This is my last
years of teaching.

150
00:15:42,774 --> 00:15:45,072
I heard a lot really
good things about Chicago ...

151
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,010
but I think the New York
the place to go ..

152
00:15:47,045 --> 00:15:49,843
Dramaturgy. Is that what
want to do, to study acting?

153
00:15:49,881 --> 00:15:51,906
I think I was good at it.

154
00:15:55,453 --> 00:15:59,418
What will you do next year?
- I do not know.

155
00:15:59,524 --> 00:16:03,357
How good are you?
- What? What am I good?

156
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:07,228
Yes. Deep down inside we all know that
There is something in what we do well.

157
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,290
It's just that
to be known ...

158
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:11,427
our true talents.

159
00:16:11,469 --> 00:16:13,460
You know you're good at,
as, teaching ...

160
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,439
and as a farmer, right?

161
00:16:15,473 --> 00:16:18,374
No. I am a mediocre teacher.

162
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,072
I'm still burning farmer.

163
00:16:21,112 --> 00:16:23,774
Ah, there goes your theory.

164
00:16:23,815 --> 00:16:25,578
I do not think so.

165
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:27,244
But even if this is true ...

166
00:16:27,285 --> 00:16:30,118
there must be something
and what you are good ...

167
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,715
only what you tell me.

168
00:16:37,128 --> 00:16:38,652
But I'll find out.

169
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:42,463
<i> will find me
always want ...</ i></i>

170
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:48,029
<i> I'll always wait here </ i></i>

171
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:51,065
<i> your call ....</ i></i>

172
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:54,138
<i> Do you want to cry </ i></i>

173
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:10,418
<i> If you do not like your man </ i></i>

174
00:18:10,455 --> 00:18:13,686
<i>You feel that you 
he is doing it wrong </ i></i>

175
00:18:16,594 --> 00:18:21,031
Now, take it with food,
you know, three times.

176
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:25,534
Is everything okay?
- Oh, I'm fine, Joey.

177
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:29,301
Al. Evans was kind
to bring me drugs.

178
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,331
I wanted to give you
save up a trip to the city.

179
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:34,106
In any case I had to
I go to the old Adelmanovu house.

180
00:18:34,145 --> 00:18:35,612
I appreciate it.

181
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,514
Adelman not only
multiple owners.

182
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:43,146
Wheeler family of her
bought last month.

183
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:47,420
Retired Major from the bottom ...
- Yes. I have already met them.

184
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:51,759
Oh? Daughter? Huh?

185
00:18:51,796 --> 00:18:56,859
Not just the girl
for the farm, right?

186
00:18:56,901 --> 00:18:58,926
The father is an avid hunter.

187
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:02,667
My mother was an alcoholic.
He is trying to wean.

188
00:19:02,707 --> 00:19:05,699
Ask him if he needed
some supplies for the farm.

189
00:19:05,743 --> 00:19:08,678
The money we would definitely use it.

190
00:19:08,713 --> 00:19:10,977
If Joey cashed in all
This small change ...

191
00:19:11,015 --> 00:19:13,643
that we would probably be
enough for the entire year.

192
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:16,051
These cans of milk are in a bad place.

193
00:19:16,087 --> 00:19:21,151
It is very unfortunate because
there tight and complex ...

194
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:23,319
and for me it is too difficult
move them ...

195
00:19:23,361 --> 00:19:27,593
so I will for now, I think,
to leave them where they are.

196
00:19:27,632 --> 00:19:29,657
What are you gonna do
when it is full?

197
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,032
I do not know.

198
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,134
How is she?

199
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:40,975
Well ... it hurts more
than it admits.

200
00:19:41,012 --> 00:19:42,479
You know what it is.

201
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,175
He does not like to complain, so ...

202
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:45,807
It will get worse.

203
00:19:47,652 --> 00:19:49,119
How long?

204
00:19:51,055 --> 00:19:54,547
Well, maybe half a year,
maybe less.

205
00:19:54,592 --> 00:19:58,426
It is difficult to be precise.

206
00:20:01,032 --> 00:20:05,462
Of course I could
that was put on chemo ...

207
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:09,496
and give her a few more
months of agony.

208
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:13,102
No. I think that it does not
wants to go away, Doc.

209
00:20:13,144 --> 00:20:15,044
Razgovao you with her about it.

210
00:20:16,214 --> 00:20:22,578
No. I think she decided to leave.
- OK.

211
00:20:24,989 --> 00:20:29,221
You know what to do?
To remember ...

212
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,285
to wash the truck.

213
00:20:33,731 --> 00:20:35,221
Think about it.

214
00:20:52,617 --> 00:20:56,348
Well, kids.
Turn the Page 125th

215
00:21:13,137 --> 00:21:16,402
OK, Vacation is over.

216
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,432
Let's go inside.

217
00:21:47,972 --> 00:21:49,462
Catherine!

218
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:14,661
Catherine?

219
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,513
Why did not you say?

220
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:41,723
Why?

221
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:44,193
You know I'm here.

222
00:22:44,228 --> 00:22:46,389
You're right.

223
00:22:51,035 --> 00:22:54,004
What hold here?

224
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,007
Well ...

225
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:02,642
some hay, as you can see.

226
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,808
Probably ubudalo.

227
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:13,183
I have a few ...

228
00:23:13,224 --> 00:23:15,818
large bales of hay ...

229
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,193
but I'll have to get some more.

230
00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:54,860
Not too many people
came here, right?

231
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:59,824
No, they, uh ... definitely not.

232
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:19,617
Jesus Christ.
- What?

233
00:24:50,855 --> 00:24:52,618
Yes?

234
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:17,639
I ... I think we should
to make love.

235
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:38,215
What do you think?

236
00:27:38,255 --> 00:27:42,385
That I've never ran
sex with students.

237
00:27:42,426 --> 00:27:46,021
Are you bothered?
- I do not know.

238
00:27:46,063 --> 00:27:50,090
I think it would bother me more
If I was the first time.

239
00:27:50,134 --> 00:27:51,931
I do not think that, right?

240
00:27:51,969 --> 00:27:55,427
No. I was with other guys.

241
00:27:57,708 --> 00:27:59,175
I see.

242
00:28:01,612 --> 00:28:03,671
Did you enjoy?

243
00:28:03,714 --> 00:28:06,274
With them or with you?

244
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:09,982
It deserves.

245
00:28:11,889 --> 00:28:14,016
Well ...

246
00:28:14,058 --> 00:28:18,324
I can say that
you are the best so far.

247
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:36,803
Son of a bitch. You pay a drink.
- Of course.

248
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:41,952
What?

249
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:46,685
You know, Rosalie, I think
I was in love with you ...

250
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:49,955
all my stupid life.

251
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:52,986
Well, that's all right.
It is good for you.

252
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:57,229
Are you for another?
- Why not?

253
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,403
I go to my three.

254
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:03,907
... Mrs. Henson.
- Hello, Reverend.

255
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:06,410
... Rozali.
... Doctor.

256
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:08,412
Be happy, the war is over.

257
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:09,936
Can I shoot?

258
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:22,915
Indeed, Mr Svenden, you can not
expect to provide you with ...

259
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:24,986
to continue to teach
without a proper degree.

260
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:27,122
I do not even believe you
ever went to college.

261
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,827
You see, I think
Mr Svenden understand ...

262
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:31,836
positions
Board takes up ...

263
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,838
But, he teaches here ...

264
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:35,772
more than twenty years.

265
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,741
Not one of his students
has never been ...

266
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:40,938
denied admission to the college
for academic reasons.

267
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:43,174
Of course, there are not many
those who wanted to go ...

268
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:47,446
but the son of Mrs. Johnson
received at the university ...

269
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:49,749
academic scholarship,
and he is good.

270
00:29:49,787 --> 00:29:52,017
It happened.

271
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:54,684
We have two perfectly good
schools in the city ...

272
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,159
where surrender
professional educators.

273
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:58,458
What do you offer that they will not?

274
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,396
Opportunity to learn the basic principles ...

275
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:02,524
free bus ride
sixty miles a day ...

276
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:06,025
After getting up at dawn
and performing household tasks.

277
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,470
These children have hardly
enough time ...

278
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:10,701
to compete with children in the city.

279
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,676
Why can not you just
to take a course in college ...

280
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,701
and get a diploma,
as Mrs. Henson?

281
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,611
I have not taught
in college.

282
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,583
With all due respect, Madam,
I've had more time and resources ...

283
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:22,484
available than
which was given by Mr Svenden.

284
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,988
Do not let me opravdavaš.

285
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:27,491
I could not do that, that ...

286
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:29,493
but I did not think that the school board ...

287
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:32,724
want to expand their activities
this far out of town.

288
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:36,700
I tried to combine
service with my life.

289
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,998
I guess I was wrong.

290
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:43,531
G. Svenden, surely you can not
us to blame for your failure.

291
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:46,703
You had every chance to
gain their credentials.

292
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:52,015
You already have your
opinion on this.

293
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:57,118
Nothing else here can not say
it would change anything, right?

294
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:00,123
No. I'm afraid that's true.
We do not see any reason ...

295
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:02,092
to re-consider this matter.

296
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:04,321
Then why are you me
hell, let ...

297
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,262
to waste time
talking to you?

298
00:31:06,297 --> 00:31:09,926
We do not need such
Dictionary, Mr. Svenden.

299
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:13,267
This is because you have a bunch of
pompous asshole.

300
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:16,668
I think you owe
this board an apology.

301
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:21,975
For what? There are no rules to asshole
I can not call you asshole.

302
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:25,112
Rozali.

303
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:45,991
It is time to marry me.

304
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:47,698
I know.

305
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,531
Well, tell me.

306
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:57,208
Say: "Will you marry me?"

307
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:06,081
Want to make you happy.

308
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:12,986
... The truth?
- Yes.

309
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:19,129
You do me happy.

310
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,633
As Orin and done?

311
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:31,176
I am going home.

312
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:48,474
Hey ... You are beauty, all right.

313
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:50,987
You're a beauty, all right.

314
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,512
Here you go.

315
00:34:57,528 --> 00:35:01,430
Well, sir,
it holds its own.

316
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:02,933
That's good.

317
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,935
Yes. Is there any hunting in
lately?

318
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:07,938
I'm a little out.

319
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:10,941
I left after a few duck
with Major last week.

320
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:13,443
We had three gorgeous ...
not mine. His.

321
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:16,936
That bastard is a great scorer,
To admit him.

322
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:18,949
Good is almost like you.

323
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:22,316
- Really?
... Close.

324
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:27,023
He told me he saw a coyote
down around Ferry Road.

325
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,925
Prepared to go to it.

326
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:33,397
There are no coyotes in
This part of the country.

327
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:37,995
Maybe it was a wolf.
- There are no wolves.

328
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:44,998
Come with me I have something to give.

329
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:55,411
I'd like to have this.

330
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:58,422
I realized last
week the hard way ...

331
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:01,424
that my back was just not
as they should be.

332
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:03,359
Hunt and I are finished.

333
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:05,157
Jesus, doc.

334
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:08,932
I do not know what to say.

335
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:11,230
Are you sure about this?

336
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:14,261
I know that you always wanted.

337
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:16,432
I am tired of
its lubrication.

338
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:18,442
In any case, more
I love that you have ...

339
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:21,468
but that we are dragging around and rust.

340
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,954
OK, call me
if any changes ...

341
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:33,354
and let it do what it wants.

342
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:45,189
Jesus, Catherine.

343
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:49,458
I'm Lady Godiva.
Do you like it?

344
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,900
Coming down from a horse, you crazy.

345
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,961
What if someone enters?

346
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:55,666
What would happen?

347
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,414
Just me by surprise.

348
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:07,349
I am an old man.

349
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:10,320
Take care of my heart.

350
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,930
What if a major
find out about us?

351
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,194
What if I find out?

352
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,454
Here, something smells good.

353
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,456
Bake wild duck.

354
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:50,449
Joey, you're all dirty!

355
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,462
Are you drunk?

356
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,954
Now clean it up.
Dinner is almost ready.

357
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,662
I'm fine, Mom. I'm completely wrong.

358
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,407
Look at what my doctor immediately.

359
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:05,432
It's nice of him.

360
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,910
He said that
too old to hunt.

361
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:10,937
Can you imagine that?
Too old to hunt.

362
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,540
How are you feeling, Mom?

363
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:55,391
I feel as if someone
forgot claws in the stomach.

364
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:57,451
Do you want to invite others. Evans?

365
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:58,723
No, no, no.

366
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:09,264
You have to marry Rosalie.

367
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:12,707
I know, Mom.

368
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:16,736
She told me that he thought
do not want to marry.

369
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:18,476
I said: "Nonsense."

370
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:24,844
You just wait to die
so stop thinking about it.

371
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:29,222
I know that you wanted to marry with the
her when she married Orin.

372
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,491
Now you can
do, so come on!

373
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:36,091
Closing schools,
I'll stay out of work.

374
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:38,567
I can not get married
their jobs.

375
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:41,503
Do not talk nonsense!
Sell what is left!

376
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:44,508
Marry up with pink.
Working on his farm!

377
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:48,342
're Stupid for teachers.

378
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:56,310
Take a decent Rozali
honeymoon!

379
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:59,254
Cash in the coins.

380
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,161
<i> "They hit the waves ...</ i></i>

381
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,227
<i> penus, ships
far away ...</ i></i>

382
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:18,469
<i> "The wild unrest, snow
white tips of waves ...</ i></i>

383
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:21,945
<i> you again and again
incoming waves ...</ i></i>

384
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,970
<i> "forever seeking their shores." </ i></i>

385
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:28,041
Wait a minute. This is nowhere
does not go, right?

386
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:30,485
or that I'm not going anywhere?

387
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:33,684
Have any of you
video ocean?

388
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:37,884
I am.
- Oh, well. Come here.

389
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:46,996
Here. Hold this.

390
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:52,805
Now, what I
I say this ...

391
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:56,802
people think that poetry is
too complicated.

392
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,872
They think it's boring.
- Boring.

393
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:01,009
That's right!

394
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:05,488
Usually is,
mainly because ...

395
00:42:05,522 --> 00:42:07,490
which he wrote a bad poet.

396
00:42:07,524 --> 00:42:10,960
We say that a good poetry
what is easy.

397
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:13,429
Let us say that it is
what we feel ...

398
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:17,230
morning when you
breeze caressing your face ...

399
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:20,362
When you first feel the smell of the ocean.

400
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:24,465
When you first see the ocean ...

401
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:26,476
What did you feel?

402
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,968
Oh ... I think I
was scared.

403
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:33,780
True emotion.
She could write about it.

404
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:36,980
OK, now we
have a little test.

405
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:40,388
I want to write a song ...

406
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:43,450
about a place where you
were earlier, perhaps the lake ...

407
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:46,930
a place where
You feel something.

408
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:50,491
I think if you were somewhere ...

409
00:42:50,534 --> 00:42:52,195
You can write about it.

410
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:56,939
I'm sorry.

411
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,009
No, everything is fine. It's okay.

412
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:00,510
Explain what you said.

413
00:43:00,544 --> 00:43:03,206
What happened?
- Small accidents.

414
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:06,444
Catherine had dropped my
picture, that's all. Come on.

415
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:08,974
Well, let's Emily Dickinson.

416
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:10,953
She wrote many
love letters to a man ...

417
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:13,923
and yet say that
died a virgin.

418
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,654
I mean, even if you never
physically met the man ...

419
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:18,958
Yet she wrote some of the
best love songs ...

420
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:20,224
in the entire literature.

421
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,459
OK, that's true.

422
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:24,558
And what's the point?

423
00:43:24,601 --> 00:43:26,967
Well, you do not have
to experience something ...

424
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:29,734
to write passionately about it.

425
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,298
Everything you need
is your imagination.

426
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:35,471
"And what imagination
accepted as a beautiful ...

427
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:36,979
"Must be true ...

428
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:39,983
"Be it ever
existed or not. "

429
00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:41,609
John Keats wrote it ...

430
00:43:41,652 --> 00:43:43,745
In a letter to their
parents 1818th

431
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,483
Is that what you mean,
Catherine?

432
00:43:46,523 --> 00:43:48,491
You should be
give in this class.

433
00:44:21,498 --> 00:44:24,398
<i> heart asks for pleasure first. </ i></i>

434
00:44:24,499 --> 00:44:26,499
<i> We have to see.
Urgent </ i></i>

435
00:44:30,499 --> 00:44:33,059
Do not you like to
look for me to see.

436
00:44:33,102 --> 00:44:36,367
Some continue to stay
Our arrangement for riding.

437
00:44:36,405 --> 00:44:39,966
I do not want to koketiraš
with me in class.

438
00:44:40,009 --> 00:44:42,978
This is not a good idea, Catherine.

439
00:44:43,012 --> 00:44:45,242
You were the first flirted with me.

440
00:44:46,515 --> 00:44:48,574
You may be right
bastard, you know?

441
00:44:48,617 --> 00:44:50,983
I have not flirted with you.

442
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,352
I do not have to flirt
with you.

443
00:44:55,257 --> 00:44:56,588
Oh, God.

444
00:44:56,625 --> 00:44:58,616
're Pregnant, right?

445
00:45:00,229 --> 00:45:04,598
No. Are you worried about it?

446
00:45:04,633 --> 00:45:07,602
I passed through my head!

447
00:45:07,636 --> 00:45:11,163
Well, it happened that
diaphragm wear.

448
00:45:12,474 --> 00:45:14,066
What was the first time?

449
00:45:14,109 --> 00:45:15,701
Are you and then you had?

450
00:45:15,744 --> 00:45:17,974
Why should I tell?

451
00:45:19,982 --> 00:45:21,882
Do you now
sweet with me.

452
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:28,447
I'm not in the mood. Do not.

453
00:45:33,495 --> 00:45:37,761
I do not want anything to do
While we do not say!

454
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,894
OK. Am.
I had then.

455
00:45:42,504 --> 00:45:45,302
You knew that we
make love?

456
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:49,071
Yes. I Predosecala.

457
00:45:49,111 --> 00:45:52,046
What do you want to tell me?

458
00:45:57,519 --> 00:45:59,009
Well ...

459
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:06,291
I am pregnant.

460
00:46:21,477 --> 00:46:24,071
Well, what should we do?

461
00:46:25,747 --> 00:46:27,681
Joseph.

462
00:46:27,716 --> 00:46:30,276
Just kidding!

463
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:36,582
Just kidding?

464
00:46:39,495 --> 00:46:41,690
Come here.

465
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:45,325
I will not touch it, and!

466
00:48:41,483 --> 00:48:43,815
You smell like the ocean.

467
00:48:45,487 --> 00:48:47,478
I am your ocean.

468
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,991
As a hurricane is coming.

469
00:49:02,437 --> 00:49:06,396
There is a girl in your class
who is in love with you.

470
00:49:06,441 --> 00:49:07,908
There are always some.

471
00:49:07,943 --> 00:49:11,401
Remember Kristine,
those with big brown eyes?

472
00:49:11,446 --> 00:49:12,913
Yes, I remember.

473
00:49:12,948 --> 00:49:15,007
"Mr. Svenden,
would you like ...

474
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:17,541
"Take a ride
the father's new Cadillac. "

475
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:22,651
It was nice.
- You're horrible!

476
00:49:22,691 --> 00:49:25,956
Whether she kept
horse in your barn?

477
00:50:01,496 --> 00:50:04,465
Major?
- Good morning, Joseph!

478
00:50:04,499 --> 00:50:07,024
He lost a partner to hunt.
I thought you might like ...

479
00:50:07,069 --> 00:50:09,060
to go out with me
to hunt birds.

480
00:50:09,104 --> 00:50:11,163
I heard that you are very good.

481
00:50:12,507 --> 00:50:14,805
And I heard the same about you.

482
00:50:16,511 --> 00:50:17,978
So?

483
00:50:38,533 --> 00:50:39,966
You little nervous.

484
00:50:40,001 --> 00:50:44,560
Relax. They will
come at any moment.

485
00:50:46,808 --> 00:50:49,333
I have never chased more
than we need.

486
00:50:49,378 --> 00:50:53,645
And you?
- No. Absolutely not.

487
00:50:53,715 --> 00:50:56,650
That's good.
I'm too old ...

488
00:50:56,685 --> 00:50:59,518
to kill only
for murder.

489
00:50:59,554 --> 00:51:02,546
It aggravates me no more
satisfaction.

490
00:51:04,259 --> 00:51:06,693
Someone told me
you saw a coyote ...

491
00:51:06,728 --> 00:51:08,286
down in the vicinity of Ferry Road.

492
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:11,959
No. I thought the coyote but it is not.

493
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,592
He was too big.

494
00:51:13,635 --> 00:51:17,469
It was a wolf, and I will
catch that bastard.

495
00:51:17,506 --> 00:51:22,136
I thought not to kill
animals just for fun.

496
00:51:22,177 --> 00:51:24,145
Well, let's take the example of coyote.

497
00:51:24,179 --> 00:51:27,979
These are interesting animals,
Very clever.

498
00:51:28,016 --> 00:51:31,042
Did you know that they can
steal your nose ...

499
00:51:31,086 --> 00:51:34,913
chicken, pig, hamster, or
pet - just like that!

500
00:51:35,023 --> 00:51:36,991
And disappear before
you become aware!

501
00:51:37,025 --> 00:51:38,652
They deserve to be killed.

502
00:51:40,529 --> 00:51:43,623
They are independent
and determined.

503
00:51:43,665 --> 00:51:45,496
If his mouth is
caught in a trap ...

504
00:51:45,534 --> 00:51:47,502
he will bite
to escape.

505
00:51:47,536 --> 00:51:50,061
Independent, my ass!
Only the greedy.

506
00:51:50,105 --> 00:51:52,005
What you can not eat or fuck ...

507
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:54,531
only the records,
like any other dog.

508
00:52:01,483 --> 00:52:03,144
Here they come.

509
00:52:03,185 --> 00:52:04,675
The first one is yours.

510
00:52:11,493 --> 00:52:12,687
The right to the finish!

511
00:52:15,397 --> 00:52:18,491
Something not of this morning.

512
00:53:11,753 --> 00:53:16,918
I increased her dose.

513
00:53:16,958 --> 00:53:21,224
So will some time
be stunned.

514
00:53:22,998 --> 00:53:28,026
I think you should
obavestiš your sister.

515
00:53:30,872 --> 00:53:33,841
Why? To be able to
start a discussion ...

516
00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:36,969
on their part of the land?

517
00:53:37,012 --> 00:53:39,344
Mom and I were talking.

518
00:53:39,381 --> 00:53:43,477
She does not want to
none of them know.

519
00:53:43,518 --> 00:53:45,543
Well, it is probably right.

520
00:54:47,015 --> 00:54:48,778
See what I have brought.

521
00:54:48,817 --> 00:54:51,911
It is a 'sour mash' bourbon.
Twenty years old.

522
00:54:51,953 --> 00:54:54,979
I know what it is.

523
00:54:55,023 --> 00:54:56,991
Try it!

524
00:54:57,025 --> 00:55:00,984
Not now. I have a hangover.

525
00:55:01,029 --> 00:55:03,429
You want to see Bolo?

526
00:55:03,465 --> 00:55:05,797
I will now.

527
00:55:07,469 --> 00:55:09,460
I'm too dressed up.

528
00:55:12,841 --> 00:55:14,103
How is your mother?

529
00:55:15,977 --> 00:55:18,605
Why are you interested
my mother?

530
00:55:19,981 --> 00:55:24,449
She was an alcoholic, periodically.
That's why I never drink.

531
00:55:31,493 --> 00:55:34,121
Do you like blue?

532
00:55:36,431 --> 00:55:38,490
I think so.

533
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,536
I thought you wanted.

534
00:55:48,576 --> 00:55:51,636
Let's go home!

535
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:55,172
No. I told you,
never at home.

536
00:55:55,216 --> 00:55:59,783
You do not love me anymore.
- I love you, Catherine.

537
00:55:59,788 --> 00:56:01,847
No, you do not like.
You will get married with Rosalie.

538
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:05,758
Oženicu up with pink?
Who told you that?

539
00:56:05,794 --> 00:56:07,887
Robert. He did not
very happy about it.

540
00:56:07,929 --> 00:56:11,456
The two of you become
very close, right?

541
00:56:11,499 --> 00:56:13,262
Robert needs a friend.

542
00:56:13,301 --> 00:56:15,326
He was comfortable with me,
and he is cute.

543
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:16,530
I love it.

544
00:56:18,039 --> 00:56:20,872
I do not want to talk
of Robert.

545
00:56:20,909 --> 00:56:23,434
What did you tell him?

546
00:56:23,478 --> 00:56:27,938
What? About us?
A wedding?

547
00:56:27,982 --> 00:56:35,078
Nothing.
I did not tell him anything.

548
00:56:46,768 --> 00:56:50,101
Still want me,
Do not you, Joseph?

549
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:57,341
I promise you ...

550
00:56:59,514 --> 00:57:02,449
I will NEVER EVER
nothing to say about us.

551
00:57:19,634 --> 00:57:23,331
Hello, Joe.
What are you doing?

552
00:57:23,371 --> 00:57:26,067
Uh, dozing. What the hell?

553
00:57:28,843 --> 00:57:30,333
Doc.

554
00:57:36,017 --> 00:57:38,577
He would tell my father!

555
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:40,281
No, no.
He will not tell anyone.

556
00:57:40,321 --> 00:57:43,347
He can come back here!
- He will not tell anyone!

557
00:57:54,402 --> 00:57:56,370
Bert, can I get a glass?

558
00:57:56,471 --> 00:57:57,961
Of course, Joe.

559
00:58:08,183 --> 00:58:11,314
She certainly has a sweet, young body ...

560
00:58:11,353 --> 00:58:15,221
but they should at ograniciš
fucking with adults, silly!

561
00:58:17,526 --> 00:58:18,823
Here you go.

562
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:20,987
Thank you, Bert. Thanks.

563
00:58:21,029 --> 00:58:25,125
When you are so young and in
confusion as she ...

564
00:58:25,166 --> 00:58:26,793
You will create problems.

565
00:58:26,835 --> 00:58:28,302
I treat her mother.

566
00:58:28,336 --> 00:58:33,227
Of course, maybe you want problems,
because you certainly have them.

567
00:58:33,241 --> 00:58:35,835
How long does this happen?

568
00:58:35,877 --> 00:58:39,711
I do not know.
Three months, maybe four.

569
00:58:41,383 --> 00:58:43,317
It was her idea.

570
00:58:43,351 --> 00:58:45,979
It has 17, and these 47,
and it was her idea?

571
00:58:46,021 --> 00:58:52,080
You're funny, boy!
- OK. It was my idea.

572
00:58:54,563 --> 00:58:58,431
This is my first initiative
in many years.

573
00:58:58,466 --> 00:59:03,130
Do you take vitamins
or something?

574
00:59:03,171 --> 00:59:06,038
Rosalie looks quite happy.

575
00:59:06,074 --> 00:59:10,272
Listen, this will
pass, you know it.

576
00:59:10,312 --> 00:59:15,807
Well. If you will have to go ...

577
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:19,786
dwell for the duration,
because it is fun.

578
00:59:19,821 --> 00:59:22,585
I was quiet for too long!

579
00:59:22,624 --> 00:59:26,651
You can not you trust me, Doc ...

580
00:59:26,695 --> 00:59:29,994
but never in my life
I have not made love so much.

581
00:59:30,031 --> 00:59:32,329
When you get older and when
osvrneš in the back ...

582
00:59:32,367 --> 00:59:34,335
you will not regret things
that you did ...

583
00:59:34,369 --> 00:59:36,667
but only for those who did not ...

584
00:59:36,705 --> 00:59:39,503
but ... Joseph ...

585
00:59:39,541 --> 00:59:42,101
It's awfully young.

586
00:59:48,383 --> 00:59:50,044
How's your mother?

587
00:59:50,085 --> 00:59:53,213
He would not last a month.

588
00:59:55,223 --> 00:59:58,420
You will not even you,
If major reveals.

589
00:59:59,761 --> 01:00:02,958
Well, you might just as well
shooting in the healthy leg.

590
01:00:08,403 --> 01:00:11,236
Oh, add a little more.

591
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:16,437
My egg is broken.
- Take another.

592
01:00:23,718 --> 01:00:25,447
Two down.

593
01:00:32,794 --> 01:00:34,659
What are you going to drink?

594
01:00:34,696 --> 01:00:36,721
Beer and tomato juice.

595
01:00:36,765 --> 01:00:40,394
Kathy. Robert.
- Hello, sir Svenden.

596
01:00:40,435 --> 01:00:41,925
Kathy. Robert.

597
01:01:05,894 --> 01:01:08,385
Here you go.
- Thanks.

598
01:01:10,598 --> 01:01:12,862
They spend a lot of
time together.

599
01:01:12,901 --> 01:01:16,337
Who?
- The two of them.

600
01:01:33,755 --> 01:01:37,223
Can I sit?
- Of course.

601
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:54,238
Robert was really sweet.

602
01:01:54,275 --> 01:01:56,743
You have done a great
job raising him.

603
01:01:56,778 --> 01:01:59,406
Lucky to have
mother like you.

604
01:01:59,447 --> 01:02:02,382
Well thank you.

605
01:02:02,417 --> 01:02:06,841
Although, I think it would be good ...

606
01:02:06,921 --> 01:02:10,186
when they could freely
talk to you.

607
01:02:10,225 --> 01:02:14,389
To talk with me?
What?

608
01:02:14,429 --> 01:02:17,364
Have not you noticed
that is depressed?

609
01:02:17,398 --> 01:02:21,266
I mean, I was upset
because of you and Joseph.

610
01:02:21,302 --> 01:02:24,897
Catherine, I think it
none of your business!

611
01:02:24,939 --> 01:02:28,568
Yes. Robert is my friend.

612
01:02:31,112 --> 01:02:35,776
I'm sorry. I do not want
to create problems.

613
01:02:39,587 --> 01:02:41,578
Sorry!

614
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:05,232
You know, I like Catherine.
Full of sparks.

615
01:03:05,313 --> 01:03:07,713
Robert is fun with it.

616
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,892
You want to enter?

617
01:03:23,398 --> 01:03:24,729
No.

618
01:03:31,406 --> 01:03:33,067
Come inside.

619
01:03:35,243 --> 01:03:36,574
No.

620
01:03:40,915 --> 01:03:42,382
Let's do it here.

621
01:03:43,818 --> 01:03:47,754
Joseph! No!
Let's go inside, please.

622
01:03:50,091 --> 01:03:54,528
No. I'll probably go home.

623
01:04:19,721 --> 01:04:22,519
What's wrong, Joey?

624
01:04:22,557 --> 01:04:25,583
Glupiraš around with
such a young girl.

625
01:04:25,627 --> 01:04:30,357
You know?
- Of course I know.

626
01:04:30,431 --> 01:04:34,527
I do not know you were
I thought that you're wrong.

627
01:04:34,569 --> 01:04:38,733
I realized the first day
when the Jeep entered the courtyard.

628
01:04:40,241 --> 01:04:43,039
I know.

629
01:04:43,077 --> 01:04:47,377
What can I say?
I'm a bad man.

630
01:04:47,415 --> 01:04:54,045
But sometimes it is really
fun to be bad.

631
01:04:54,055 --> 01:04:57,616
You're not bad.

632
01:04:57,659 --> 01:05:01,755
If it makes men bad,
everyone would have lost.

633
01:05:09,637 --> 01:05:12,629
I'm tired, Joey!

634
01:05:14,809 --> 01:05:17,107
Allow me to put
to bed, Mom.

635
01:05:17,145 --> 01:05:21,605
No, I tired
I of this body.

636
01:05:21,649 --> 01:05:27,917
Oh, it's .. it's worse than a bear
baby every day.

637
01:05:24,152 --> 01:05:27,952
it is worse than the bear
baby every day.

638
01:06:14,302 --> 01:06:17,965
I will call dr. Evans
to see what he thinks.

639
01:06:18,006 --> 01:06:22,443
No, no, it is not necessary!

640
01:06:22,477 --> 01:06:25,310
And wake in the morning.

641
01:06:27,815 --> 01:06:31,307
Good night, Mom.
- Good night.

642
01:07:45,159 --> 01:07:46,990
Rosalie!

643
01:07:50,164 --> 01:07:53,463
Rosalie!

644
01:07:53,501 --> 01:07:55,992
Where are the dogs?

645
01:07:59,607 --> 01:08:02,940
What is it with you?
Here people are asleep.

646
01:08:02,977 --> 01:08:04,569
What is it?

647
01:08:04,612 --> 01:08:07,410
I might have the flu.

648
01:08:07,448 --> 01:08:09,882
You had the flu for months.

649
01:08:09,917 --> 01:08:11,885
You're acting very strange ...

650
01:08:11,919 --> 01:08:14,683
I think that it is not
because of your mother.

651
01:08:14,722 --> 01:08:16,553
Perhaps the andropause.

652
01:08:16,591 --> 01:08:18,422
Men my age
passing through it.

653
01:08:18,459 --> 01:08:21,983
They know they will die without being
did what they wanted.

654
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:24,428
Nonsense!
What do you want to do ...

655
01:08:24,465 --> 01:08:28,561
other than to fuck a film
star like everyone else?

656
01:08:28,603 --> 01:08:29,934
What I want to do?

657
01:08:29,971 --> 01:08:31,962
I would like to spend
some time in the ocean ...

658
01:08:32,006 --> 01:08:35,503
where there are no students
There are no people in the boat ... ...

659
01:08:35,576 --> 01:08:40,639
just reading, drinking,
fishing, swimming.

660
01:08:40,681 --> 01:08:42,740
You know what would once
wanted to do?

661
01:08:42,783 --> 01:08:45,308
I would like to fuck
with all the lights on!

662
01:08:45,353 --> 01:08:48,447
I would like to do everything
what I dreamed.

663
01:08:48,489 --> 01:08:50,753
I'm tired of fucking
in the dark ...

664
01:08:50,791 --> 01:08:53,954
Friday and Sunday evenings,
and sometimes on Wednesdays!

665
01:08:57,565 --> 01:08:59,294
Look at me!

666
01:08:59,333 --> 01:09:04,762
I'm 47 years old and never
and I fucked the day ..

667
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:06,773
let alone video ocean!

668
01:09:06,807 --> 01:09:10,709
We were once in Washington
We have never been to New York.

669
01:09:10,745 --> 01:09:15,409
I want to change it before
be too old and die ...

670
01:09:15,449 --> 01:09:16,848
and then it is too late!

671
01:09:19,153 --> 01:09:21,986
Do not you want to
be different?

672
01:09:22,023 --> 01:09:25,481
I'm sick of your
role of the damned widows.

673
01:09:27,562 --> 01:09:31,123
I love you more than
the age of eighteen years.

674
01:09:31,165 --> 01:09:35,629
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry to disappoint.

675
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:40,295
Look at me ... but my legs
you've seen a hundred times.

676
01:09:40,374 --> 01:09:42,342
Do I look so damn weird ...

677
01:09:42,376 --> 01:09:44,936
I must be
closed in the dark ...

678
01:09:44,979 --> 01:09:47,641
like a goddamn freak?

679
01:09:47,682 --> 01:09:51,083
Do not watch me,
nor do we answer.

680
01:09:53,354 --> 01:09:56,687
I want to fuck with me ...

681
01:09:56,724 --> 01:10:01,559
like you to Orino
when you had 16 ..

682
01:10:01,596 --> 01:10:07,298
or 20 or 25 .. like you said.

683
01:10:10,037 --> 01:10:14,098
I do not want just to fuck
sad, the widow of a teacher ...

684
01:10:14,141 --> 01:10:16,041
and then wither and die.

685
01:10:16,077 --> 01:10:18,978
Oh, shut up. Please, shut up.

686
01:10:26,921 --> 01:10:29,856
I have a bit to think.

687
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:38,230
I need a drink.
- And bring me one!

688
01:10:38,266 --> 01:10:40,427
If I have here
I stand all night ...

689
01:10:40,468 --> 01:10:43,335
the least we can
I do not drink it.

690
01:11:39,427 --> 01:11:40,792
By the end!

691
01:11:40,828 --> 01:11:45,724
All?
- Absolutely everything.

692
01:12:18,399 --> 01:12:20,629
Well, go and this

693
01:12:27,575 --> 01:12:32,203
Well. Now we can
to start.

694
01:12:42,089 --> 01:12:44,580
Joseph ...

695
01:12:47,094 --> 01:12:49,528
This is fun.

696
01:12:49,563 --> 01:12:52,726
Oh, Rosalie!

697
01:13:34,074 --> 01:13:39,706
<i> now teaches the body

698
01:13:39,747 --> 01:13:42,910

01:14:09,376 --> 01:14:10,707

01:14:10,744 --> 01:14:12,939

01:14:22,656 --> 01:14:25,318
<i> and to which they return. </ i></i>

714
01:14:46,847 --> 01:14:48,678
No thanks.

715
01:15:02,963 --> 01:15:04,794
Do you want more?

716
01:15:47,841 --> 01:15:49,604
Here you go.

717
01:15:49,643 --> 01:15:51,406
What is it?

718
01:15:51,445 --> 01:15:54,608
How could you?

719
01:15:54,648 --> 01:15:56,980
What?

720
01:16:00,081 --> 01:16:03,081
<i> know you can and happy.
Love, Catherine. </ I></i>

721
01:16:03,082 --> 01:16:05,882
<i> P.S. Now we can
to work at home </ i></i>

722
01:16:05,926 --> 01:16:10,488
I thought we go
much better after that night.

723
01:16:13,934 --> 01:16:17,028
I answered to your
messages of condolence ...

724
01:16:17,071 --> 01:16:20,734
that I spared you
additional pain.

725
01:16:20,774 --> 01:16:22,935
Do you believe it?

726
01:16:22,976 --> 01:16:26,912
We are better.
It was just a stupid kid.

727
01:16:26,947 --> 01:16:29,108
Then why are you fucked a child?

728
01:16:29,149 --> 01:16:31,447
Would I not enough?

729
01:16:31,485 --> 01:16:34,147
I sacrificed a life for you.

730
01:16:36,156 --> 01:16:40,825
I thought I needed
something to make up.

731
01:16:40,861 --> 01:16:44,353
Oh God, I sit here and think ...

732
01:16:44,398 --> 01:16:48,596
misses the mark on his life,
and I have to pay for it?

733
01:16:49,670 --> 01:16:52,639
I will not get a second chance

734
01:16:54,441 --> 01:16:56,602
Oh, damn you.

735
01:16:56,643 --> 01:16:58,702
I hope you die!

736
01:17:01,615 --> 01:17:03,276
Rosalie!

737
01:17:11,225 --> 01:17:13,921
Rosalie!

738
01:17:13,961 --> 01:17:16,759
Rosalie!

739
01:17:16,797 --> 01:17:19,095
Rosalie!

740
01:17:19,133 --> 01:17:22,102
Rosalie!

741
01:17:22,136 --> 01:17:23,330
What is it?

742
01:17:23,370 --> 01:17:24,598
They argued.

743
01:17:24,638 --> 01:17:26,162
What happens?

744
01:17:26,206 --> 01:17:28,140
Why was arguing with her?

745
01:17:56,837 --> 01:17:58,304
Joseph?

746
01:17:58,338 --> 01:18:00,329
What? Yes.

747
01:18:02,609 --> 01:18:04,406
What are you doing?

748
01:18:04,444 --> 01:18:08,073
Huh? What?

749
01:18:08,115 --> 01:18:09,912
You're drunk.

750
01:18:14,454 --> 01:18:18,288
Rozali. Rozali knows.

751
01:18:20,961 --> 01:18:23,429
I'm sorry, but she had to
find out sooner or later.

752
01:18:23,463 --> 01:18:26,091
but she had to learn
sooner or later.

753
01:18:26,133 --> 01:18:27,293
Why?

754
01:18:28,969 --> 01:18:31,437
Because I want to
marry with me.

755
01:18:31,471 --> 01:18:33,632
I'm not going to get married!

756
01:18:38,312 --> 01:18:41,281
Do you hear me?

757
01:18:41,315 --> 01:18:43,647
I will not mention that.

758
01:19:05,939 --> 01:19:07,770
Catherine?

759
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:16,181
Catherine.

760
01:19:23,290 --> 01:19:25,986
Do not be mad.

761
01:19:26,026 --> 01:19:28,961
I'm not crazy.

762
01:19:30,297 --> 01:19:33,095
I love you ...

763
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:38,396
but I like pink.

764
01:19:40,974 --> 01:19:44,603
Do you remember
I said that I'll find out ...

765
01:19:44,645 --> 01:19:46,806
the single thing that you're good?

766
01:19:55,822 --> 01:19:57,653
You do not listen.

767
01:20:09,002 --> 01:20:11,493
You will be sorry.

768
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:29,153
Rosalie?

769
01:20:32,693 --> 01:20:36,561
Rozali must immediately
to talk.

770
01:20:36,596 --> 01:20:39,565
I can not get married with you ...

771
01:20:39,599 --> 01:20:42,830
and the rest of my life
I Orinov spirit.

772
01:20:42,869 --> 01:20:45,667
Fuck Orinov spirit.

773
01:20:45,706 --> 01:20:48,004
Orin is dead, and I'm alive.

774
01:20:48,041 --> 01:20:50,134
I live three miles
along the way ...

775
01:20:50,177 --> 01:20:55,577
I wonder why I wasted
life of the damned mad.

776
01:20:58,885 --> 01:21:01,149
It is now 2:00 in the morning.

777
01:21:01,188 --> 01:21:04,521
Please leave before
you wake up Lily.

778
01:21:29,316 --> 01:21:31,841
You will not you let it
remain here, right?

779
01:21:37,190 --> 01:21:40,125
You want to bring
blanket, please?

780
01:21:42,963 --> 01:21:46,296
Robert, please
Bring a blanket?

781
01:21:58,879 --> 01:22:01,211
I want to go
here.

782
01:22:01,248 --> 01:22:02,806
He's a liar.

783
01:22:03,884 --> 01:22:05,784
I feel like a fool ...

784
01:22:05,819 --> 01:22:09,619
Like I was the subject of
a joke or something like that.

785
01:22:09,656 --> 01:22:11,954
Believe me,
no one laughs.

786
01:22:11,992 --> 01:22:14,153
He's just a liar ....

787
01:22:17,831 --> 01:22:20,356
Catherine was bored
and she wanted sex ...

788
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,265
and a man lost his head.

789
01:22:22,302 --> 01:22:24,293
He will get over it,
same as you.

790
01:22:24,337 --> 01:22:25,770
That's not true.

791
01:22:25,806 --> 01:22:29,298
Catherine is a wonderful person.
He seduced her.

792
01:22:29,342 --> 01:22:32,243
Robert, you are still ignorant boy.

793
01:22:32,279 --> 01:22:34,304
I do not know anything about women.

794
01:22:34,347 --> 01:22:37,373
I know more than you think.
She is my friend.

795
01:22:37,417 --> 01:22:38,975
I'm with her.

796
01:22:39,019 --> 01:22:42,819
Oh, strong thing. Jesus.

797
01:22:42,856 --> 01:22:44,483
Thus, Catherine is a young
and beautiful ...

798
01:22:44,524 --> 01:22:46,822
comes from unhappy family ...

799
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:48,987
and they make love.

800
01:22:49,029 --> 01:22:50,656
Why people can not make love ...

801
01:22:50,697 --> 01:22:54,326
without all those damn evil?

802
01:22:54,367 --> 01:22:56,767
These are just nonsense.

803
01:22:56,803 --> 01:23:00,102
How the hell
you know what I feel?

804
01:23:56,795 --> 01:24:02,492
This was a tough test
for both, right?

805
01:24:20,319 --> 01:24:23,015
What can I tell you, son?

806
01:24:25,891 --> 01:24:28,553
What do you know about my father?

807
01:24:28,594 --> 01:24:31,392
Your father?

808
01:24:31,430 --> 01:24:36,333
He was better at everything
from me, except for fishing.

809
01:24:38,937 --> 01:24:43,567
He loved to fight with fists,
I was good at it.

810
01:24:43,609 --> 01:24:46,407
Did you like it?

811
01:24:46,445 --> 01:24:49,846
I thought it was the greatest.

812
01:24:49,881 --> 01:24:52,714
He was my best friend.

813
01:24:52,751 --> 01:24:57,914
Why he went to war?
He was not invited.

814
01:24:57,956 --> 01:25:01,915
You think, why he left
You and your mother?

815
01:25:02,995 --> 01:25:05,259
You want the truth?

816
01:25:05,297 --> 01:25:09,427
Here he was bored.

817
01:25:16,274 --> 01:25:19,641
I want to warn you.

818
01:25:19,678 --> 01:25:22,169
What do you warn me?

819
01:25:22,214 --> 01:25:23,977
Major knows.

820
01:25:24,016 --> 01:25:26,985
I think that coming to see you.

821
01:28:23,795 --> 01:28:26,161
Stop!

822
01:28:28,133 --> 01:28:31,500
Joseph, what are you doing?

823
01:28:31,536 --> 01:28:33,299
Are you armed?

824
01:28:33,338 --> 01:28:39,299
No. Jesus.
Why should I be armed?

825
01:28:44,382 --> 01:28:46,111
Who is that in the jeep?

826
01:28:46,151 --> 01:28:49,120
My wife. We
whether to enter?

827
01:28:50,622 --> 01:28:52,021
Of course.

828
01:28:55,927 --> 01:28:59,886
You want to sit down
and something to drink?

829
01:28:59,931 --> 01:29:01,865
Yes, thank you.

830
01:29:23,188 --> 01:29:25,179
That all I wanted.

831
01:29:40,405 --> 01:29:41,838
Thank you.

832
01:29:54,419 --> 01:29:58,947
I wanted to talk
about fishing.

833
01:30:01,927 --> 01:30:03,792
I see that you are shaking hands.

834
01:30:05,196 --> 01:30:08,393
Catherine said she will
to marry her.

835
01:30:08,433 --> 01:30:10,060
Is this true?

836
01:30:11,937 --> 01:30:14,906
No. No, no.

837
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:18,307
It would be stupid.

838
01:30:18,343 --> 01:30:20,743
I'm not her type.

839
01:30:20,779 --> 01:30:22,542
What is her type?

840
01:30:24,649 --> 01:30:27,914
Someone who is rich
and knowledgeable.

841
01:30:27,953 --> 01:30:30,945
Someone who is a refined ...

842
01:30:30,989 --> 01:30:34,425
living in urban areas, and closer to the
her age.

843
01:30:34,459 --> 01:30:36,757
I wanted to know
I'm not a fool ...

844
01:30:36,795 --> 01:30:39,286
I do not like me
real fool.

845
01:30:39,331 --> 01:30:41,663
We moved here ...

846
01:30:41,700 --> 01:30:46,137
partly to the shelter
of these types of people.

847
01:30:46,171 --> 01:30:49,504
But Catherine is closed half
with very good success.

848
01:30:49,541 --> 01:30:51,406
perhaps its
best so far.

849
01:30:51,443 --> 01:30:54,571
I do not know what
life you lead ...

850
01:30:54,612 --> 01:30:58,871
but I guess not
experienced in these matters.

851
01:30:58,917 --> 01:31:01,408
No, I think not.

852
01:31:03,855 --> 01:31:07,154
This was my first time
to do so.

853
01:31:12,097 --> 01:31:16,830
I could not help myself,
Even when I knew it was wrong.

854
01:31:16,868 --> 01:31:19,234
And I think you're wrong.

855
01:31:19,270 --> 01:31:22,931
But I can only you
to blame, because knowing Catherine ...

856
01:31:23,041 --> 01:31:26,169
I believe that less than
half of that idea was yours.

857
01:31:26,211 --> 01:31:28,441
I can not tell you
what is going on in her mind.

858
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:30,414
You are polite, know this.

859
01:31:30,448 --> 01:31:34,009
Just know that you should not
try to marry her.

860
01:31:34,052 --> 01:31:38,216
You alone are more abused than
someone who has used his advantage.

861
01:31:38,256 --> 01:31:41,987
Mr. Svenden,
did you know that I know ...

862
01:31:42,027 --> 01:31:44,996
you're asleep
with my daughter?

863
01:31:45,030 --> 01:31:48,857
Beverly ...
Honey, are you listening?

864
01:31:48,867 --> 01:31:51,631
Shut up.
- Mrs. ...

865
01:31:51,669 --> 01:31:53,864
Beverly, come on, baby.
Let's go home.

866
01:31:53,905 --> 01:31:55,873
It was a long day.

867
01:31:55,907 --> 01:31:57,966
I'm tired, and you're tired.

868
01:32:00,912 --> 01:32:02,345
We'll talk again.

869
01:32:05,083 --> 01:32:07,210
Let's just in the car.

870
01:32:09,854 --> 01:32:12,482
I am waiting, sir Svenden.

871
01:32:15,693 --> 01:32:17,320
Beverly, it's time to go.

872
01:32:17,362 --> 01:32:19,557
Bastard.

873
01:32:21,666 --> 01:32:23,861
It's okay. Come on.

874
01:32:53,131 --> 01:32:56,758
How did you come here?
- Robert took me.

875
01:32:56,801 --> 01:32:59,133
Where is he?
- He's gone.

876
01:33:03,608 --> 01:33:07,772
Dad said that he would
talk to you.

877
01:33:07,812 --> 01:33:10,474
Well, I talked it,
like your mother.

878
01:33:14,085 --> 01:33:17,054
Dad said that you never
would not have married me ...

879
01:33:17,088 --> 01:33:19,716
and I just
izigravala fool.

880
01:33:19,757 --> 01:33:24,526
That's not true, right?
Because it can not be true.

881
01:33:24,629 --> 01:33:26,529
I mean, do not you
you see that I give you ...

882
01:33:26,564 --> 01:33:28,623
best year of my life?

883
01:33:30,568 --> 01:33:32,968
It sucks.

884
01:33:33,004 --> 01:33:35,939
What would you do it this year,
fucked up with Robert?

885
01:33:35,974 --> 01:33:39,432
See what I am
done with his life.

886
01:33:39,477 --> 01:33:42,878
And we do not know the
even a full year.

887
01:33:44,883 --> 01:33:46,874
Again play the role!

888
01:33:49,888 --> 01:33:51,412
Catherine.

889
01:33:54,392 --> 01:33:57,361
We care a lot for each other.

890
01:33:57,395 --> 01:34:00,228
We spent together
memorable moments.

891
01:34:01,966 --> 01:34:05,094
But I'm damn old man ...

892
01:34:05,136 --> 01:34:09,261
and you're beautiful, you're brilliant ...

893
01:34:09,340 --> 01:34:11,934
and have seventeen years.

894
01:34:11,976 --> 01:34:14,604
I thought you loved me.

895
01:34:14,646 --> 01:34:19,508
I love you enough to know
what is best for you.

896
01:34:19,551 --> 01:34:21,985
No. You are what you
is good for me.

897
01:34:22,020 --> 01:34:23,612
Come on, let's just ..

898
01:34:23,655 --> 01:34:26,920
Can not we just be lovers
as we were in the beginning?

899
01:34:28,860 --> 01:34:33,126
I bet they would not be married
for me that I asked.

900
01:34:33,164 --> 01:34:35,132
You're using me ...

901
01:34:35,166 --> 01:34:38,863
While you were out of town.

902
01:34:38,903 --> 01:34:40,495
That's fine.

903
01:34:57,388 --> 01:35:00,414
I did something wrong.

904
01:35:00,458 --> 01:35:02,255
What?

905
01:35:03,995 --> 01:35:05,895
Look!

906
01:35:07,632 --> 01:35:10,157
Jesus. What are the hell did they make?

907
01:36:25,343 --> 01:36:27,470
Bolo.

908
01:36:31,215 --> 01:36:33,206
Bolo.

909
01:37:07,151 --> 01:37:09,312
You ... are you okay?

910
01:37:18,196 --> 01:37:19,823
Oh, dear.

911
01:37:31,843 --> 01:37:33,834
Why did you do?

912
01:37:35,847 --> 01:37:38,111
I was angry at you.

913
01:37:38,149 --> 01:37:41,141
So there you have burned so
your horse?

914
01:37:44,422 --> 01:37:49,614
I was expecting you to
it save her ... but did not.

915
01:37:56,367 --> 01:37:58,301
Come on.

916
01:37:58,336 --> 01:38:00,327
Come on.

917
01:38:00,371 --> 01:38:02,931
I will take you home ..

918
01:40:37,261 --> 01:40:40,560
I heard what happened last night.

919
01:40:40,598 --> 01:40:43,089
Nothing is left of the barn?

920
01:40:44,402 --> 01:40:45,801
It is not.

921
01:40:45,836 --> 01:40:48,100
Completely disappeared.

922
01:40:57,915 --> 01:40:59,678
It's strange, but ...

923
01:40:59,717 --> 01:41:02,117
I think that I have overturned ...

924
01:41:02,153 --> 01:41:05,281
potcenjuci and all these years, but ...

925
01:41:10,695 --> 01:41:13,926
Do you know why
I liked Catherine ...

926
01:41:13,965 --> 01:41:17,366
except, of course, because her body?

927
01:41:19,370 --> 01:41:22,339
Because it is not even a person.

928
01:41:22,373 --> 01:41:26,434
You do not have to give her
none of them.

929
01:41:26,477 --> 01:41:31,943
She does not even know that you
gave her ... if you gave her.

930
01:41:34,385 --> 01:41:36,376
Maybe so. I do not know.

931
01:41:40,891 --> 01:41:42,882
I do not have some justification.

932
01:41:46,897 --> 01:41:49,627
I think I wanted
to lose my head ...

933
01:41:51,268 --> 01:41:54,533
but it certainly did not want ...

934
01:41:54,572 --> 01:41:57,097
When Catherine and I have started.

935
01:41:59,310 --> 01:42:02,336
This is what I was raised.

936
01:42:05,349 --> 01:42:09,718
Then we had that night,
when we were swept passion ...

937
01:42:09,754 --> 01:42:12,518
For the first time
of our youth.

938
01:42:17,194 --> 01:42:21,756
We worked a little, and
in fact we did not know ...

939
01:42:21,799 --> 01:42:25,360
what we do before
we did.

940
01:42:33,544 --> 01:42:36,672
And I want to
to be in ecstasy.

941
01:43:06,844 --> 01:43:09,335
I love you, Rosalie!

942
01:43:11,849 --> 01:43:13,817
Ever.

943
01:44:16,347 --> 01:44:18,247
Joseph!

944
01:44:18,282 --> 01:44:20,614
Joseph, come on!

945
01:44:27,358 --> 01:44:29,656
Come!
