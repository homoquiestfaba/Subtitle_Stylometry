1
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:21,602
Shit!

2
00:02:02,407 --> 00:02:03,806
Stop, please!

3
00:02:22,367 --> 00:02:25,882
In a related story,
the high court had also refused to stay...

4
00:02:25,967 --> 00:02:29,596
Friday's execution of former
philosophy professor David Gale.

5
00:02:29,847 --> 00:02:32,805
Gale had sought a review
of his 1994 conviction...

6
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:35,845
for the rape and murder of his
University of Austin colleague...

7
00:02:35,927 --> 00:02:37,280
Constance Harraway.

8
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:39,835
The case has received
nationwide media attention...

9
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:43,397
because Gale and Harraway
were activists for DeathWatch...

10
00:02:43,487 --> 00:02:45,682
a non-profit
abolitionist organisation.

11
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:49,123
Do you understand how much money
taxpayers pay in Texas...

12
00:02:49,207 --> 00:02:50,481
to put one person to death?

13
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:53,240
- What do we want?
- No more executions!

14
00:02:53,327 --> 00:02:56,444
Governor, can't we all admit
the capital punishment system...

15
00:02:56,527 --> 00:02:57,880
in this country is not working?

16
00:02:57,967 --> 00:03:00,640
They're not going to stay Gale.
It's on TV right now. Listen.

17
00:03:00,727 --> 00:03:02,479
Defence lawyers
had hoped to argue...

18
00:03:02,567 --> 00:03:05,320
that Gale's former activism
against capital punishment...

19
00:03:05,407 --> 00:03:08,001
unduly prejudiced
the Texas judicial system.

20
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:11,443
The deal was Bitsey would get
the interview if the stay was refused.

21
00:03:11,527 --> 00:03:13,563
He'll talk to her
for two hours a day:

22
00:03:13,647 --> 00:03:15,683
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.

23
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:17,885
Can't do Friday. No.

24
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,284
Friday's the day they execute him.

25
00:03:21,727 --> 00:03:23,683
The lawyer said only Bitsey.

26
00:03:23,767 --> 00:03:25,325
Gale's going down.

27
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:29,677
Only Bitsey means only Bitsey.
I don't get to make the rules, Joe.

28
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:31,644
Please, I'm a fat black woman.

29
00:03:31,727 --> 00:03:34,082
What we need is
to put her on a plane to Texas.

30
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:37,876
Why do you get like that around
legal? Hold on, we're coming over.

31
00:03:40,327 --> 00:03:42,682
What's this "Only Bitsey
means only Bitsey" stuff?

32
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:44,837
They asked for you,
and no substitutes.

33
00:03:44,927 --> 00:03:46,883
- Who's they, exactly?
- Gale's lawyers.

34
00:03:46,967 --> 00:03:50,403
More exactly, Gale's lawyer.
Some good old boy in Austin.

35
00:03:50,527 --> 00:03:51,676
Why do they want me?

36
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:54,235
- You don't want the assignment?
- I'm not saying that.

37
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:56,557
I can't see why
a guy about to be executed...

38
00:03:56,647 --> 00:03:57,966
should suddenly ask for me.

39
00:03:58,047 --> 00:04:01,164
Maybe they liked your kiddie
porn piece, and going to jail.

40
00:04:01,247 --> 00:04:03,602
Maybe he saw your picture
and thinks you're cute.

41
00:04:03,687 --> 00:04:06,963
- So how much access do I get?
- Three interviews. No time for more.

42
00:04:07,047 --> 00:04:08,639
By Friday, the guy's a goner.

43
00:04:09,447 --> 00:04:12,962
- What exactly is our story?
- Rape, murder, death row.

44
00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:16,325
Very intelligent guy.
Maybe he's even innocent.

45
00:04:16,407 --> 00:04:17,726
Yeah, right.

46
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:20,876
No, tell him I'll call him back.
Thanks.

47
00:04:21,207 --> 00:04:22,720
So what's your problem?

48
00:04:22,807 --> 00:04:26,083
Hi, Barbara. 'Morning, Bitsey.
Okay, here's my concern.

49
00:04:26,447 --> 00:04:27,846
Setting aside the cost issue...

50
00:04:27,927 --> 00:04:31,044
although $500,000 in cash
for three days of interviews...

51
00:04:31,127 --> 00:04:33,004
is not only illegal, it's obscene.

52
00:04:33,087 --> 00:04:35,726
That's market value.
The guy's never talked.

53
00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:39,197
Aside from that, I, we are still
uncomfortable with the arrangement.

54
00:04:39,527 --> 00:04:40,482
Why?

55
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:43,035
You just spent
a very public seven days in jail...

56
00:04:43,127 --> 00:04:45,277
for a very public
contempt-of-court citation.

57
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:48,518
For protecting sources. If you were
uncomfortable with the story...

58
00:04:48,607 --> 00:04:51,405
why did you slap it on the domestic
and international covers?

59
00:04:51,487 --> 00:04:55,366
What makes us uncomfortable is
that a rapistlmurderer...

60
00:04:55,447 --> 00:04:57,677
has asked to spend
the last three days of his life...

61
00:04:57,767 --> 00:04:59,962
giving an interview,
his very first...

62
00:05:00,047 --> 00:05:03,198
to a reporter who is now famous
for protecting sexual deviants.

63
00:05:03,287 --> 00:05:05,847
A reporter who is also
a very attractive woman.

64
00:05:05,927 --> 00:05:09,124
This is disparate treatment.
Oh, boy.

65
00:05:09,207 --> 00:05:10,879
I could go if I were an ugly guy?

66
00:05:10,967 --> 00:05:14,118
The agenda issue would be diffused
with the presence of a male.

67
00:05:14,207 --> 00:05:18,883
I hear lawyers gleefully saying:
"Bloom versus News Magazine Inc. "

68
00:05:18,967 --> 00:05:21,401
"Your Honour, I started to notice
my assignments...

69
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,637
"were being determined
on the basis of my sex. "

70
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:25,285
You've got to let her go now.

71
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,927
- That's not what I meant.
- He's got to let you go.

72
00:05:28,007 --> 00:05:29,998
All right. Enough.

73
00:05:30,087 --> 00:05:32,681
But the intern
will be with you at all times.

74
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:34,405
What? Intern.

75
00:05:34,487 --> 00:05:36,921
- No, you've got to be kidding.
- That's what he said.

76
00:05:37,007 --> 00:05:38,599
- He's a jerk.
- He's the boss.

77
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,759
- Not an intern. I always work alone.
- Not this time, Bitsey.

78
00:05:41,847 --> 00:05:43,280
I'm not baby-sitting.

79
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:02,198
Gale's DNA was everywhere.
His semen was inside her.

80
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:03,800
He was seen leaving her house.

81
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:06,720
His prints were all over the
kitchen, including one on the bag.

82
00:06:06,807 --> 00:06:09,685
- Half a thumbprint.
- Half a thumbprint. That's enough.

83
00:06:09,767 --> 00:06:12,122
He could've touched it
before it was a murder weapon.

84
00:06:12,207 --> 00:06:14,084
You fondle your friends'
garbage bags?

85
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:16,601
Yeah, I get very touchy
around household plastics.

86
00:06:16,687 --> 00:06:18,598
I'm particularly fond of Tupperware.

87
00:06:18,687 --> 00:06:19,802
Tupperware?

88
00:06:19,887 --> 00:06:23,880
I'm just saying the bag could've
been sitting on the counter.

89
00:06:25,007 --> 00:06:27,521
He did it. Now he's going to die.
And you know something?

90
00:06:27,607 --> 00:06:29,484
Maybe that's exactly
what he deserves.

91
00:06:29,567 --> 00:06:31,523
But the murder's
way too fucking clumsy.

92
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:35,600
This guy is an intellectual. Top of
his Harvard class, Rhodes scholar...

93
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:38,121
tenured at 27, two books published.

94
00:06:38,327 --> 00:06:39,919
He's an academic stud.

95
00:06:40,047 --> 00:06:42,481
Look at his wife.
A regular Grace Kelly.

96
00:06:43,047 --> 00:06:45,720
Old money svelte.
Father was ambassador to Spain.

97
00:06:46,047 --> 00:06:49,835
- Shit! The light's on again.
- Ignore it, it's a rental.

98
00:06:50,207 --> 00:06:53,438
- Do you smell anything?
- The guy's a flaming Liberal.

99
00:06:53,527 --> 00:06:55,245
A person's politics
has nothing to do...

100
00:06:55,327 --> 00:06:57,477
- with his tendency to commit crime.
- Wrong.

101
00:06:57,567 --> 00:06:59,398
Shouldn't it smell
if it's overheating?

102
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:02,240
Seventy-three percent of
all serial killers vote Republican.

103
00:07:02,327 --> 00:07:04,602
Throw your cigarette out,
so we can smell.

104
00:07:06,607 --> 00:07:08,325
You'll stink up the car.
Throw it out.

105
00:07:08,407 --> 00:07:10,125
I'm not going to fucking pollute.

106
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:27,716
There's definitely something wrong
with this car.

107
00:07:28,007 --> 00:07:29,326
This is so irritating.

108
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,726
How far to Huntsville?

109
00:07:30,927 --> 00:07:32,565
I'm going to pull off.

110
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:36,120
"News Magazine reporters
Bitsey Bloom and Zack Stemmons...

111
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:37,959
"entered the rest area
with car troubles.

112
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:41,164
"Little did they know it wasn't
just their car that was in trouble. "

113
00:07:42,647 --> 00:07:44,842
I'm a reporter. You're an intern.

114
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:48,356
Whatever.

115
00:08:03,727 --> 00:08:04,876
Is it hot?

116
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:07,717
Jesus, yes! Isn't it always?

117
00:08:08,967 --> 00:08:10,116
What do I do?

118
00:08:10,287 --> 00:08:13,165
Call the office and get
the rental road service number.

119
00:08:15,927 --> 00:08:18,122
No signal.
God damn it.

120
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,401
I've got to pee.

121
00:08:42,007 --> 00:08:43,076
Zack!

122
00:09:06,607 --> 00:09:08,962
DAY ONE

123
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:35,841
'Morning.
Hi.

124
00:09:39,127 --> 00:09:41,004
A little early for that, isn't it?

125
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:43,637
The non-smoking section's
over there.

126
00:09:44,007 --> 00:09:45,599
I meant the book.

127
00:09:46,207 --> 00:09:48,323
Dialogical Exhaustion by David Gale.

128
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:50,566
The guy's a genius.

129
00:09:51,247 --> 00:09:53,363
- What time is it?
- 9:15 a. m.

130
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:57,682
There are 10 prisons around here.
Death row is in the Ellis unit...

131
00:09:57,767 --> 00:10:00,804
but they're moving it to the
Terrell unit at the end of the year.

132
00:10:00,887 --> 00:10:02,605
The waitress's boyfriend
works there.

133
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:04,803
Her last boyfriend
worked in the Huntsville unit.

134
00:10:04,887 --> 00:10:06,639
The two before that in Walker.

135
00:10:06,727 --> 00:10:08,797
The Estelle unit
has the cutest guys.

136
00:10:08,887 --> 00:10:12,766
And I'm quoting, "My butt's too big
to get an Estelle guy. "

137
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:18,164
Ellis is 15 minutes out of town.
We've got five and a half hours.

138
00:10:18,247 --> 00:10:21,205
Never eat in a place where
the menus have pictures of the food.

139
00:10:21,527 --> 00:10:24,087
We should drive into Austin.
Check out the crime scene.

140
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:26,476
That could be
some great stuff for our story.

141
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:30,163
This isn't our story. It's not even
a story. It's an interview.

142
00:10:31,087 --> 00:10:34,318
Most importantly for you
to remember, it's my interview.

143
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:38,282
What do I do
for the next five hours?

144
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:40,756
Drive around.
Look for a decent restaurant.

145
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:46,000
Your reputation
as Mike Wallace with PMS...

146
00:10:46,087 --> 00:10:47,520
doesn't do you justice.

147
00:10:47,887 --> 00:10:49,639
My reputation got us invited here.

148
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,366
I play by the rules,
even if my colleagues don't like it.

149
00:10:52,447 --> 00:10:53,960
- It's called...
- Ambition?

150
00:10:54,047 --> 00:10:54,957
Objectivity.

151
00:10:55,047 --> 00:10:57,515
- What can I get you, ma'am?
- Just coffee.

152
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:03,366
Don't push me, smart ass.

153
00:11:18,487 --> 00:11:20,079
You know you're in the Bible belt...

154
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:22,203
when there are more churches
than Starbucks.

155
00:11:22,287 --> 00:11:24,721
When there are more prisons
than Starbucks.

156
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:43,919
He's ready for y'all now.

157
00:12:44,127 --> 00:12:45,196
Yes, I am.

158
00:12:48,687 --> 00:12:52,839
I'm not gonna debate with you the
rights and wrongs of the situation.

159
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:55,956
Our job
is to run the state prison system.

160
00:12:57,807 --> 00:13:01,083
This is not France.
This is not Germany. This is Texas.

161
00:13:01,167 --> 00:13:03,158
And we're gonna follow Texas law.

162
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:06,316
You're very welcome, ma'am.
Goodbye, now.

163
00:13:07,447 --> 00:13:08,766
Thank you, Margie.

164
00:13:09,327 --> 00:13:12,125
Correspondents Bloom and Stevens,
I presume?

165
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:13,435
Yes, hello.

166
00:13:13,887 --> 00:13:16,924
- Stemmons.
- Sorry. Won't happen again.

167
00:13:17,127 --> 00:13:19,721
I'm Duke Grover,
TDCJ, Community Relations.

168
00:13:19,807 --> 00:13:21,877
He's usually real good with names.

169
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,435
And these days
I always like to ask...

170
00:13:24,527 --> 00:13:26,757
do you prefer Miss, Mrs., or Ms.?

171
00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:29,363
- Bitsey.
- Bitsey it is.

172
00:13:29,607 --> 00:13:32,201
- Margie, I'm stealing your guests.
- Okey-dokey.

173
00:13:32,607 --> 00:13:34,518
- You ever been in a prison?
- Yes.

174
00:13:34,607 --> 00:13:36,006
- On death row?
- No.

175
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:37,766
ID's again, please.

176
00:13:37,927 --> 00:13:41,886
All executions in the state of Texas
occur at the Huntsville unit.

177
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:44,276
But death row
is here for the time being.

178
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:47,922
This is home to all 442 offenders
prior to their date.

179
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:50,403
Average stay on the row
is nine years.

180
00:13:50,487 --> 00:13:53,160
Some get commuted,
but most get put to death.

181
00:13:54,287 --> 00:13:57,245
It'll put you off your supper,
but then, it's supposed to.

182
00:13:57,927 --> 00:14:01,078
New York guests for Mr. Gale.
Can I get your bags?

183
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:04,762
We have three concerns here:
Safety, safety, and safety.

184
00:14:04,967 --> 00:14:07,003
The visitation area
is entirely secure.

185
00:14:07,087 --> 00:14:09,123
We just ask
that you don't touch the glass.

186
00:14:09,207 --> 00:14:10,879
Windex gets expensive.

187
00:14:11,407 --> 00:14:13,762
You're not carrying a weapon,
are you, Bitsey?

188
00:14:16,847 --> 00:14:17,916
Sorry. No.

189
00:14:18,207 --> 00:14:20,118
- Mr. Stemmons, you packing?
- No, sir.

190
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:22,243
Cell phone?
They're not working.

191
00:14:22,327 --> 00:14:24,522
Then you won't mind
leaving them here.

192
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:27,963
We also have rules against the
carrying of large sums of cash...

193
00:14:28,047 --> 00:14:30,117
and the wearing of open-toed shoes.

194
00:14:31,327 --> 00:14:34,285
Those will do just fine.
You want to step on through now?

195
00:14:34,767 --> 00:14:35,916
There you go.

196
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,517
Thank you, ma'am.
That's right.

197
00:14:40,007 --> 00:14:42,202
- Open-toed shoes?
- Drives them crazy.

198
00:14:42,527 --> 00:14:45,166
Your turn, Mr. Stemmons.
Right on through there.

199
00:14:45,407 --> 00:14:46,362
Good.

200
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:50,085
Should anything unpleasant
occur in the visitation area...

201
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:51,725
we ask you to stay put.

202
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:54,879
Please follow the instructions
of our fine correctional officers...

203
00:14:54,967 --> 00:14:57,037
should they see fit to give you any.

204
00:14:57,847 --> 00:15:00,202
Anything you say can be overheard.

205
00:15:00,487 --> 00:15:04,480
Any discussion of criminal activity
on your part is admissible.

206
00:15:04,647 --> 00:15:07,320
You're not planning on a jailbreak,
are you?

207
00:15:07,687 --> 00:15:09,996
The rain seems to be holding off.

208
00:15:10,247 --> 00:15:13,717
You watch your step here.
This cement can get pretty slippery.

209
00:15:14,207 --> 00:15:15,959
This is our Japanese garden.

210
00:15:16,407 --> 00:15:19,160
We ask you
not to throw coins in the pond.

211
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:22,998
Right this way. Almost there.

212
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:28,157
Here we are. This is our
visitation area right here.

213
00:15:29,287 --> 00:15:30,959
All yours, Mr. Belyeu.

214
00:15:31,247 --> 00:15:34,319
That's it for me.
You folks have a safe visit.

215
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:36,319
Thank you.
'Bye now.

216
00:15:36,407 --> 00:15:37,681
Ms. Bloom?
Yes.

217
00:15:38,047 --> 00:15:40,436
Come right on in here
and make yourself comfortable.

218
00:15:40,527 --> 00:15:42,677
Did that PR man
validate your parking?

219
00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:44,843
He said the gift shop would do it.

220
00:15:45,247 --> 00:15:46,600
She's a smart one.

221
00:15:46,807 --> 00:15:48,923
Braxton Belyeu, Mr. Gale's attorney.

222
00:15:49,007 --> 00:15:51,362
This is Zack Stemmons.
My good pleasure.

223
00:15:51,687 --> 00:15:54,360
And right over here,
we have the man of the hour.

224
00:16:03,687 --> 00:16:04,722
Hello.

225
00:16:05,287 --> 00:16:06,356
- Hello.
- Hi.

226
00:16:06,727 --> 00:16:09,241
GUARD Sit down, Gale.
Prisoner will not stand.

227
00:16:09,487 --> 00:16:11,603
Why can't they turn that thing down?

228
00:16:12,327 --> 00:16:14,124
My lawyer respectfully requests...

229
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,880
that you adjust the volume
on the speaker system.

230
00:16:17,007 --> 00:16:19,760
GUARD Gale, sit down.

231
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:26,317
They're practicing
being cruel and unusual.

232
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:30,556
I'm sure you're biting at the bit.

233
00:16:30,767 --> 00:16:34,396
It is our understanding that you are
to have three two-hour sessions.

234
00:16:34,687 --> 00:16:36,678
Today, tomorrow, and Thursday.

235
00:16:36,967 --> 00:16:38,844
All at 3:00 p. m.

236
00:16:39,607 --> 00:16:41,837
I'm sorry
we can't afford you more time.

237
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:45,363
But contrary to popular rumour,
we have not yet begun to fight.

238
00:16:46,087 --> 00:16:48,521
It is our understanding
that you will do this alone.

239
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,643
- The magazine would prefer that...
- Alone.

240
00:16:50,727 --> 00:16:51,716
Understood.

241
00:16:51,807 --> 00:16:56,437
Also, you'll use
no recording equipment of any kind.

242
00:16:56,607 --> 00:16:58,040
Correct.
Excellent.

243
00:16:58,327 --> 00:17:01,285
I have a few papers for which I need
your Jo Anne Hancock.

244
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:05,565
So if you'd stop by my Austin office
at your earliest convenience.

245
00:17:05,647 --> 00:17:07,160
Thursday morning, say?

246
00:17:07,407 --> 00:17:08,965
Expenses and so forth.

247
00:17:12,127 --> 00:17:14,721
Fine. Till Thursday, then.
Good luck.

248
00:17:15,047 --> 00:17:16,480
I'll stop by later.

249
00:17:18,927 --> 00:17:22,363
What say you and me partake
of a death-defying cigarette...

250
00:17:22,447 --> 00:17:24,244
in the visitors' parking lot?

251
00:17:24,327 --> 00:17:25,316
Bye-bye, y'all.

252
00:17:33,567 --> 00:17:34,522
So...

253
00:17:35,247 --> 00:17:37,044
Please pull up a seat.

254
00:17:43,527 --> 00:17:45,597
He's quite a character.
Yes.

255
00:17:45,687 --> 00:17:48,201
He's about the only outside contact
I have now.

256
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,606
And a good friend.

257
00:17:50,887 --> 00:17:52,366
Where's your ex-wife?

258
00:17:52,647 --> 00:17:55,684
I don't want you to ask me questions
about her or my son.

259
00:17:56,447 --> 00:17:57,960
What I offer you is one thing.

260
00:17:58,047 --> 00:18:00,515
Questions about them
are not part of our deal.

261
00:18:00,607 --> 00:18:01,596
Okay.

262
00:18:02,407 --> 00:18:05,205
Just say, "Off the record,"
and I'll take it to my grave.

263
00:18:05,287 --> 00:18:06,720
You can trust me on that.

264
00:18:07,847 --> 00:18:09,963
Does this count
as recording equipment?

265
00:18:13,607 --> 00:18:15,916
- How do we start?
- We start with...

266
00:18:17,287 --> 00:18:19,357
you telling me what I'm doing here.

267
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:23,322
No one who looks through that glass
sees a person.

268
00:18:23,407 --> 00:18:24,681
They see a crime.

269
00:18:25,607 --> 00:18:28,644
I'm not David Gale.
I'm a murderer and a rapist.

270
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,877
Four days shy of his execution.

271
00:18:32,847 --> 00:18:34,758
You're here
because I want to be remembered...

272
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,919
as much for how I led my life
and the decisions that I made...

273
00:18:38,007 --> 00:18:39,963
as for how my life ended.

274
00:18:41,127 --> 00:18:43,197
- Why me?
- Why not?

275
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:46,081
You've spent some time
behind bars yourself recently.

276
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,441
I certainly have.

277
00:18:47,607 --> 00:18:49,916
Because you do
take things to your grave.

278
00:18:50,527 --> 00:18:53,963
Protecting sources, even kiddie porn
scum, is the magazine policy...

279
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:55,799
- and mine.
- I know.

280
00:18:56,767 --> 00:18:58,325
That's your reputation.

281
00:19:00,447 --> 00:19:03,041
I have a hard story
for you to tell, Miss Bloom.

282
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:05,839
It's not going to be easy.

283
00:19:08,407 --> 00:19:09,601
Where do we begin?

284
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:14,635
I should tell you
how I became Head of Philosophy...

285
00:19:14,727 --> 00:19:16,319
at the University of Austin.

286
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:23,801
Come on, think.

287
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:26,602
I want you to reach back
into those minds.

288
00:19:26,727 --> 00:19:28,479
And tell me, tell us all...

289
00:19:28,807 --> 00:19:31,640
what is it that you fantasise about?

290
00:19:32,607 --> 00:19:33,722
World peace?

291
00:19:34,447 --> 00:19:35,482
Thought so.

292
00:19:36,407 --> 00:19:38,796
Do you fantasise
about international fame?

293
00:19:41,127 --> 00:19:43,925
Do you fantasise
about winning a Pulitzer Prize?

294
00:19:44,647 --> 00:19:46,160
Or a Nobel Peace Prize?

295
00:19:47,047 --> 00:19:48,878
An MTV Music Award?

296
00:19:50,247 --> 00:19:53,762
Do you fantasise
about meeting some genius hunk...

297
00:19:53,847 --> 00:19:57,681
ostensibly bad, but secretly
simmering with noble passion...

298
00:19:57,767 --> 00:19:59,997
and willing to sleep
on the wet spot?

299
00:20:00,927 --> 00:20:02,645
I'll take two!
What was that?

300
00:20:02,727 --> 00:20:05,082
- I'll take two!
- Kimberley will take two.

301
00:20:05,847 --> 00:20:07,485
You get Lacan's point:

302
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:10,920
Fantasies have to be unrealistic.

303
00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:14,279
Because the moment, the second
that you get what you seek...

304
00:20:14,367 --> 00:20:16,517
you don't,
you can't want it anymore.

305
00:20:17,047 --> 00:20:19,083
In order to continue to exist...

306
00:20:19,527 --> 00:20:23,361
desire must have its objects
perpetually absent.

307
00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:27,156
It's not the "it" that you want,
it's the fantasy of "it. "

308
00:20:28,247 --> 00:20:31,637
Desire supports crazy fantasies.

309
00:20:33,327 --> 00:20:34,282
Sorry.

310
00:20:38,927 --> 00:20:42,761
This is what Pascal means when he
says that we are only truly happy...

311
00:20:43,407 --> 00:20:46,001
when daydreaming
about future happiness.

312
00:20:46,247 --> 00:20:47,236
It came today.

313
00:20:47,327 --> 00:20:49,966
Or why we say,
"The hunt is sweeter than the kill. "

314
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,799
Or, "Be careful what you wish for. "

315
00:20:51,887 --> 00:20:53,605
Not because you'll get it...

316
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:56,600
because you're doomed
not to want it once you do.

317
00:20:57,167 --> 00:20:58,998
So the lesson of Lacan is:

318
00:20:59,167 --> 00:21:01,681
Living by your wants
will never make you happy.

319
00:21:01,767 --> 00:21:03,519
What it means to be fully human...

320
00:21:03,607 --> 00:21:06,280
is to strive to live
by ideas and ideals.

321
00:21:06,367 --> 00:21:08,358
Not to measure your life...

322
00:21:08,447 --> 00:21:11,484
by what you've attained
in terms of your desires...

323
00:21:12,327 --> 00:21:16,605
but those moments of integrity,
compassion, rationality...

324
00:21:17,367 --> 00:21:18,800
even self-sacrifice.

325
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:20,600
Because in the end...

326
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:24,043
the only way we can measure
the significance of our own lives...

327
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:26,403
is by valuing the lives of others.

328
00:21:30,927 --> 00:21:33,122
All right,
I'll see you all on Monday.

329
00:21:54,967 --> 00:21:56,525
Sorry about being late.

330
00:21:57,807 --> 00:21:59,604
There was, you know, a thing.

331
00:22:00,847 --> 00:22:02,678
There usually is, Berlin.

332
00:22:04,007 --> 00:22:06,123
I know that I'm not doing too well.

333
00:22:07,767 --> 00:22:10,918
And to torture a cliché...

334
00:22:13,287 --> 00:22:15,005
I would do anything to pass.

335
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:21,002
Anything?

336
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:23,122
Any...

337
00:22:24,607 --> 00:22:25,562
thing.

338
00:22:28,567 --> 00:22:29,795
Okay, Berlin.

339
00:22:34,567 --> 00:22:38,606
I will give you a very good grade...

340
00:22:40,247 --> 00:22:42,124
if you would just...

341
00:22:45,207 --> 00:22:46,322
study.

342
00:22:56,087 --> 00:22:59,045
The TA's transcribed the Governor's
radio and TV comments.

343
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,526
Listen to this gem.

344
00:23:00,727 --> 00:23:02,797
"Journalist: Governor,
don't you think...

345
00:23:02,887 --> 00:23:04,957
"three executions
in one week is excessive?"

346
00:23:05,047 --> 00:23:09,040
"Governor: I say bring 'em in, strap
'em down and let's rock and roll. "

347
00:23:09,127 --> 00:23:12,085
It's good that our governor's
in touch with his inner frat boy.

348
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:14,237
Tell me
why you're not doing this debate?

349
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:16,045
Telegenics. You have a cuter butt.

350
00:23:16,127 --> 00:23:17,719
- I hadn't noticed.
- I know.

351
00:23:17,807 --> 00:23:19,445
I didn't mean that.

352
00:23:19,727 --> 00:23:21,160
I've highlighted some stuff.

353
00:23:28,127 --> 00:23:30,163
He'll do the whole
down-home wisdom thing.

354
00:23:30,247 --> 00:23:33,125
"Capital punishment is God's law,"
"An eye for an eye" and all.

355
00:23:33,207 --> 00:23:36,563
Stick to arguments about
rational facts, and watch your ego.

356
00:23:36,927 --> 00:23:38,280
Don't come across as:

357
00:23:38,367 --> 00:23:40,835
"I hate authority because
everyone here wears big hats...

358
00:23:40,927 --> 00:23:43,202
"and nobody in charge
reads The New Yorker. "

359
00:23:43,287 --> 00:23:44,242
Anything else?

360
00:23:44,327 --> 00:23:46,238
I'm getting new stats
from Amnesty tonight.

361
00:23:46,327 --> 00:23:48,283
Bring them by Greer's party.

362
00:23:48,447 --> 00:23:50,085
I have papers to grade.

363
00:23:50,527 --> 00:23:53,087
- Lf you have a hangover tomorrow...
- I'm walking away.

364
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:54,316
10:00 a. m.

365
00:23:54,647 --> 00:23:57,207
Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed!
Bushy-tailed!

366
00:24:10,487 --> 00:24:12,876
Hey, Jamie.
Did you mark your calendar yet?

367
00:24:13,127 --> 00:24:14,446
I sure did.

368
00:24:14,967 --> 00:24:18,960
One, two, three, four more days
until Mum comes home.

369
00:24:19,127 --> 00:24:22,164
Only four more days?
That's great news.

370
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:26,204
Can I ask you something?
It's really important.

371
00:24:26,287 --> 00:24:27,606
Of course you can.

372
00:24:27,727 --> 00:24:30,002
Can we have pancakes for breakfast?

373
00:24:32,087 --> 00:24:34,157
With syrup and strawberries?

374
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:37,844
- We'll have to see.
- And chocolate shavers?

375
00:24:38,767 --> 00:24:41,281
No, it's chocolate shavings.

376
00:24:41,727 --> 00:24:44,082
And whipped cream?
Whipped cream?

377
00:24:44,407 --> 00:24:46,796
That's a lot of requests
for one little boy.

378
00:24:47,367 --> 00:24:48,846
Why don't you go to sleep?

379
00:24:48,927 --> 00:24:52,078
Do Cloud Dog, too.
Good night, Cloud Dog.

380
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,556
There you go.

381
00:24:53,767 --> 00:24:55,086
You go to sleep.

382
00:24:56,247 --> 00:24:57,316
Good night.

383
00:24:58,847 --> 00:25:01,407
Don't forget to feed the fish.
What?

384
00:25:01,487 --> 00:25:04,160
Don't forget to feed the fish.
Okay.

385
00:25:07,807 --> 00:25:11,595
I'll be back before midnight. Here's
the number if you have to reach me.

386
00:25:11,687 --> 00:25:14,406
There's chicken in the refrigerator,
if you want some.

387
00:25:14,487 --> 00:25:17,081
That's fine. Maybe I'll fix myself
something later.

388
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:18,486
'Bye.
'Bye.

389
00:25:25,487 --> 00:25:27,079
Dad, did you feed the fish?

390
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:29,522
Yes, I did. Now go to sleep.

391
00:25:42,727 --> 00:25:44,957
He's the Immanuel Kant of the NFL.

392
00:25:45,047 --> 00:25:46,878
He's consistent, accurate,
effective...

393
00:25:46,967 --> 00:25:48,844
and let's not forget boring.

394
00:25:48,927 --> 00:25:51,122
- He is boring.
- Lf you want boring...

395
00:25:51,207 --> 00:25:53,641
read William Bennett's
Book of Virtues. I'm still asleep.

396
00:25:53,727 --> 00:25:54,842
Someone wake me up.

397
00:25:54,927 --> 00:25:57,441
- John, how are you?
- Where's your better half?

398
00:25:58,287 --> 00:26:00,642
My wife? She's in Spain.

399
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:02,319
Again? I am sorry.

400
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,366
John, have you seen Alma?
She's been looking for you.

401
00:26:05,447 --> 00:26:08,120
My wife's affair is
just this big, open secret.

402
00:26:08,687 --> 00:26:10,006
Hermeneutical bias.

403
00:26:10,087 --> 00:26:12,681
The only fun truths are the ones
someone's trying to hide.

404
00:26:12,767 --> 00:26:14,883
She's been to Barcelona
four times this year.

405
00:26:14,967 --> 00:26:16,764
I don't think
she's trying to hide anything.

406
00:26:16,847 --> 00:26:18,485
Her father is the ambassador.

407
00:26:18,567 --> 00:26:21,035
Yeah, except the embassy's
in Madrid.

408
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:23,479
By the way, Berlin's here.

409
00:26:24,367 --> 00:26:26,039
- Pretty livid.
- Why?

410
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:28,482
We've expelled her.
She got the letter today.

411
00:26:28,567 --> 00:26:30,956
Took the opportunity
to throw a fit in my office.

412
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,366
Talking about me?

413
00:26:32,887 --> 00:26:34,445
As a matter of fact, we were.

414
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:36,757
Did he tell you
I said when you were circumcised...

415
00:26:36,847 --> 00:26:38,678
they threw away the wrong part?

416
00:26:38,927 --> 00:26:40,599
Yes, he mentioned it.

417
00:26:40,687 --> 00:26:42,518
It's called schmuck.
What?

418
00:26:42,607 --> 00:26:45,644
The part of the foreskin
they throw away after circumcision.

419
00:26:45,727 --> 00:26:46,955
It think it's called schmuck.

420
00:26:47,047 --> 00:26:50,005
- Aren't we so fucking clever.
- Perhaps I should get another.

421
00:26:50,327 --> 00:26:51,555
Black Bush.

422
00:26:51,647 --> 00:26:53,842
You were a jerk this afternoon.

423
00:26:54,607 --> 00:26:57,246
I didn't know about the expulsion
till just now.

424
00:26:57,327 --> 00:26:59,363
Is that supposed to be an apology?

425
00:26:59,447 --> 00:27:00,402
No.

426
00:27:01,607 --> 00:27:04,121
It's more like a conciliation.

427
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:28,235
PEOPLE AT PARTY Ross! Ross!

428
00:27:30,327 --> 00:27:31,362

Okay, I'm finished. I'm done.

I'm not a student anymore.

Yeah. Very cute.

I have a secret.

453
00:29:20,767 --> 00:29:22,644
But I have to come over there
to tell you.

454
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:23,682
No.

455
00:29:25,287 --> 00:29:26,436

You stay back.
I come.

Woman.

458
00:29:30,567 --> 00:29:33,525
You should stay...

459
00:29:34,047 --> 00:29:36,277
I wasn't after the grade.

Or you can put your mouth

00:29:54,767 --> 00:29:56,086
Don't reject me.

465
00:29:57,567 --> 00:29:58,522
Please.

466
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:21,800
Rip them.
What?

467
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:23,036
Rip them off.

468
00:30:44,887 --> 00:30:46,479
No. From behind.

469
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:48,482
From behind.

470
00:30:59,207 --> 00:31:00,322
Do it hard.

471
00:31:09,127 --> 00:31:10,276
Harder.

472
00:31:12,327 --> 00:31:13,646
Bite my shoulder.

473
00:31:30,087 --> 00:31:31,759
Thanks for coming, people.

474
00:31:33,887 --> 00:31:35,957
I don't care where you go. Come on!

475
00:31:36,047 --> 00:31:39,084
All right, you guys,
it's time to go home! Good night!

476
00:31:47,327 --> 00:31:49,761
It won't work.
That's a faulty argument.

477
00:31:49,847 --> 00:31:52,600
Let's say we found an innocent
on death row. What would change?

478
00:31:52,687 --> 00:31:55,155
After the retrial,
the Governor would go on TV and say:

479
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:58,364
"See? Thanks to the good people
at DeathWatch, the system works. "

480
00:31:58,447 --> 00:32:01,280
If we had absolute proof
that he had executed an innocent...

481
00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:03,927
we could demand a moratorium,
like in Illinois.

482
00:32:04,807 --> 00:32:06,923
- Are you okay?
- Sorry. Yeah.

483
00:32:07,007 --> 00:32:08,326
But that won't happen.

484
00:32:08,407 --> 00:32:11,080
Dead men can't make a case,
and almost-martyrs don't count.

485
00:32:11,167 --> 00:32:12,998
- Got it.
- So keep it rational.

486
00:32:13,607 --> 00:32:14,835
And stop that!

487
00:32:15,727 --> 00:32:16,637
What?

488
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:18,558
Active listening.
I hate active listeners.

489
00:32:18,647 --> 00:32:21,525
They're too busy pretending
to listen to hear what I'm saying.

490
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:24,519
I can listen and actively listen
at the same time. I'm good at it.

491
00:32:24,607 --> 00:32:26,245
- Did you bring the Amnesty stats?
- Yes.

492
00:32:26,327 --> 00:32:28,238
No. I left them at home.

493
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:32,595
I have a copy.

494
00:32:38,047 --> 00:32:40,322
- You want to tell me what's up?
- Nothing.

495
00:32:41,247 --> 00:32:42,316
Everything.

496
00:32:45,807 --> 00:32:48,446
Something profoundly stupid
happened last night.

497
00:32:48,807 --> 00:32:50,479
I hope you used a condom.

498
00:32:54,327 --> 00:32:55,885
Jesus Christ, David.

499
00:32:58,407 --> 00:32:59,840
Was she one of yours?

500
00:33:01,487 --> 00:33:02,715
It was Berlin.

501
00:33:03,767 --> 00:33:04,756
Great.

502
00:33:07,327 --> 00:33:08,476
That's great.

503
00:33:08,967 --> 00:33:10,161
I can hear the grapevine:

504
00:33:10,247 --> 00:33:13,319
"They suspended her so Gale could
dick her with a clear conscience.

505
00:33:13,407 --> 00:33:15,125
"A power differential
equals coercion. "

506
00:33:15,207 --> 00:33:16,959
That is great. You're so weak.

507
00:33:17,047 --> 00:33:18,924
You're not my wife, Constance.
Thank God.

508
00:33:19,007 --> 00:33:21,601
Don't worry, it's not a position
I aspire to. So fuck you!

509
00:33:21,687 --> 00:33:23,723
I didn't mean it that way.
Are you okay?

510
00:33:25,207 --> 00:33:27,118
Really?
Yes! Let's go.

511
00:33:29,327 --> 00:33:32,285
There are 17,000 murders a year
in the United States.

512
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:34,881
Ten states that have abolished
the death penalty...

513
00:33:34,967 --> 00:33:37,322
have a murder rate
lower than the national average.

514
00:33:37,407 --> 00:33:40,001
If he starts with the religious
stuff, just say that...

515
00:33:40,087 --> 00:33:43,841
nearly every denomination in
the U.S. Opposes the death penalty.

516
00:33:43,967 --> 00:33:45,685
Are you listening?
Yes.

517
00:33:58,247 --> 00:33:59,600
All right, 10 seconds.

518
00:34:00,647 --> 00:34:01,762
Count them in, Mac.

519
00:34:05,807 --> 00:34:07,843
Five, four...

520
00:34:10,287 --> 00:34:11,766
Welcome back to Batter's Box.

521
00:34:11,847 --> 00:34:15,726
We continue our special four-part
program with Governor Hardin.

522
00:34:15,807 --> 00:34:18,401
And arguing capital punishment
with him...

523
00:34:18,487 --> 00:34:21,638
is DeathWatch regional co-director,
Professor David Gale.

524
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:23,206
You are up, Governor.

525
00:34:23,287 --> 00:34:26,324
I always say the same thing
and I'm gonna keep on saying it.

526
00:34:26,407 --> 00:34:29,683
I hate killing, and my
administration will kill to stop it.

527
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:31,522
How about it?

528
00:34:31,607 --> 00:34:34,724
Murderers are not deterred
by the thought of execution.

529
00:34:34,807 --> 00:34:37,799
You know it. Every single study
done on the subject...

530
00:34:37,887 --> 00:34:40,003
and there's been over 200,
you've read them...

531
00:34:40,087 --> 00:34:41,964
has reached the same conclusion.

532
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:43,765
Maybe you should read your Bible.

533
00:34:43,847 --> 00:34:47,123
Deuteronomy: 19:21. "An eye for
an eye, a tooth for a tooth. "

534
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:49,885
What did Gandhi say about that?

535
00:34:49,967 --> 00:34:53,323
"The old law of an eye for an eye
leaves us all blind. "

536
00:34:54,367 --> 00:34:57,200
I'm sorry, and with respect,
that's fuzzy liberal thinking.

537
00:34:57,287 --> 00:34:58,800
You believe that?
Of course.

538
00:34:58,887 --> 00:35:02,562
Interesting, 'cause you said it
in a speech in your first campaign.

539
00:35:03,287 --> 00:35:05,482
He got you there, Governor.
How about it?

540
00:35:05,567 --> 00:35:07,159
Yes, he did.

541
00:35:07,407 --> 00:35:09,841
"If you're not a Liberal at 30,
you've got no heart.

542
00:35:09,927 --> 00:35:12,361
"If you're still a Liberal at 40,
you've got no brain. "

543
00:35:12,447 --> 00:35:14,563
- That's Winston Churchill.
- Touché.

544
00:35:14,647 --> 00:35:18,560
What you're essentially saying is,
and this is to choose another quote:

545
00:35:18,767 --> 00:35:22,680
"A healthy society must stop at
nothing to cleanse itself of evil. "

546
00:35:25,967 --> 00:35:28,242
Yes, I'd have to agree.

547
00:35:28,647 --> 00:35:31,241
Did I say that, too?
No, sir. That was Hitler.

548
00:35:35,247 --> 00:35:38,239
Governor, can't we all just admit
the capital punishment system...

549
00:35:38,327 --> 00:35:39,840
in this country is not working?

550
00:35:39,927 --> 00:35:43,397
We are condemning people to death
based on phoney expert testimony...

551
00:35:43,487 --> 00:35:46,126
on junk science,
on jailhouse snitches.

552
00:35:46,207 --> 00:35:50,280
Did you know Texas has the highest
per capita incarceration rate...

553
00:35:50,367 --> 00:35:52,198
in the world, including in China?

554
00:35:52,287 --> 00:35:55,006
Forty-three people, Governor,
that you executed...

555
00:35:55,087 --> 00:35:58,238
were represented by lawyers
at one time disbarred or sanctioned.

556
00:35:58,327 --> 00:36:00,761
There are two men on death row
right now, on this day...

557
00:36:00,847 --> 00:36:03,919
whose lawyers fell asleep
during their cross-examination.

558
00:36:04,007 --> 00:36:04,917
I'm not a lawyer.

559
00:36:05,007 --> 00:36:07,043
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
ruled...

560
00:36:07,127 --> 00:36:09,163
that it was not a basis
for a retrial.

561
00:36:09,247 --> 00:36:12,717
Governor, that's just a flawed,
insane, crazy system.

562
00:36:12,847 --> 00:36:15,361
And a flawed system
will kill innocent men!

563
00:36:15,447 --> 00:36:17,085
All right. Let him answer.

564
00:36:17,807 --> 00:36:19,559
All right, we'll play your game.

565
00:36:19,647 --> 00:36:20,602
Name one.

566
00:36:20,927 --> 00:36:24,124
Name one innocent man that Texas
has put to death during my tenure.

567
00:36:24,207 --> 00:36:26,437
Of the 100 or so executions...

568
00:36:26,527 --> 00:36:28,597
That's 131,
in case you've lost count.

569
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,882
Let him finish.
Fine. Whatever.

570
00:36:31,367 --> 00:36:34,120
Just give me a name.
I'm gonna write it down.

571
00:36:34,527 --> 00:36:36,916
A man
that you can prove was innocent...

572
00:36:38,727 --> 00:36:40,365
and I'll call a moratorium.

573
00:36:42,847 --> 00:36:43,802
Mr. Gale?

574
00:36:46,447 --> 00:36:49,041
Are we through here?
We're running out of time.

575
00:36:49,127 --> 00:36:51,083
I'd like to thank my guests,
Governor Hardin...

576
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,964
and Professor Gale from DeathWatch.

577
00:36:53,047 --> 00:36:54,002
Roll credits.

578
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:56,043
I hope you will join me tomorrow.

579
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:01,041
Your exact words were:

580
00:37:01,127 --> 00:37:03,561
"Tell me when my ego's
getting in the way of the work. "

581
00:37:03,647 --> 00:37:06,957
- Now I'm telling you.
- I didn't want to do this.

582
00:37:07,047 --> 00:37:10,437
You put up two seconds of protest at
the thought of being on a TV debate.

583
00:37:10,527 --> 00:37:12,802
- What does that mean?
- DeathWatch suffers...

584
00:37:12,887 --> 00:37:14,923
because you're so anxious
to finger authority...

585
00:37:15,007 --> 00:37:18,283
to publicly prove David Gale
is smarter than the powers that be.

586
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:21,644
Work without an audience. Try
squeezing money from the donor list.

587
00:37:21,727 --> 00:37:23,638
Have you licked
a single mail-out envelope?

588
00:37:23,727 --> 00:37:26,002
- Mr. Gale?
- The Governor went that way.

589
00:37:26,087 --> 00:37:29,238
Ramirez. Austin Police.
This is Officer Hasermann.

590
00:37:29,327 --> 00:37:31,204
Is debating the Governor
a crime now?

591
00:37:31,287 --> 00:37:32,640
No, sir. Rape is.

592
00:37:40,327 --> 00:37:41,521
Berlin had my bite marks...

593
00:37:41,607 --> 00:37:43,245
Gale, time's up.

594
00:37:45,047 --> 00:37:47,083
...bruises, her clothes were ripped.

595
00:37:47,247 --> 00:37:49,078
My skin was found
under her fingernails.

596
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:50,998
It didn't look like
anything but rape.

597
00:37:51,087 --> 00:37:52,839
Then she drops charges
and leaves town...

598
00:37:52,927 --> 00:37:54,838
making it look like I was guilty...

599
00:37:54,927 --> 00:37:56,883
and she was too traumatised
to face trial.

600
00:37:57,167 --> 00:38:01,080
My wife read all this sitting in
the airport wondering where I was.

601
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:02,646
Why I wasn't there to pick her up.

602
00:38:02,727 --> 00:38:05,116
Took me almost two weeks
to get bailed out.

603
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:09,157
And the grad student, Berlin?
Why do you think she did it?

604
00:38:10,127 --> 00:38:11,845
To poke her finger at authority.

605
00:38:11,927 --> 00:38:14,441
Show the powers that be
how much smarter she was.

606
00:38:14,527 --> 00:38:16,836
Grad student's revenge.
I don't really know.

607
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:18,758
Know where I can find her?
No.

608
00:38:18,847 --> 00:38:22,123
First year I was in here
I got a postcard from San Francisco.

609
00:38:22,447 --> 00:38:25,484
It was signed, "From the student
who would do anything. "

610
00:38:26,327 --> 00:38:27,999
Did she say anything else?

611
00:38:28,687 --> 00:38:30,643
"I'm sorrier than you can know. "

612
00:38:30,807 --> 00:38:33,082
Move it, Gale.
I'm running out of time.

613
00:38:39,127 --> 00:38:42,517
Can you imagine his wife letting him
stew in jail for two weeks?

614
00:38:42,607 --> 00:38:43,926
Who can blame her?

615
00:38:44,087 --> 00:38:46,920
Get an address for the Berlin girl
from the university.

616
00:38:47,007 --> 00:38:48,804
Still don't think
he's telling the truth?

617
00:38:48,887 --> 00:38:51,037
On the Berlin rap?
On the whole rap.

618
00:38:51,127 --> 00:38:54,324
Who knows? Anyway, there is
no truth, only perspectives.

619
00:38:54,407 --> 00:38:57,922
If you say there's no truth, you're
claiming it's true there's no truth.

620
00:38:58,007 --> 00:38:59,565
It's a logical contradiction.

621
00:38:59,647 --> 00:39:01,877
Working on our
philosophy merit badge?

622
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:04,561
With rape, an accusation
is as good as a conviction.

623
00:39:04,647 --> 00:39:06,046
It sticks like shit.

624
00:39:06,127 --> 00:39:08,687
- That's an appetising metaphor.
- Technically a simile.

625
00:39:08,767 --> 00:39:10,439
I think he's telling the truth.

626
00:39:10,527 --> 00:39:12,518
This you know
from sitting in the prison lobby?

627
00:39:12,607 --> 00:39:14,006
It's just my perspective.

628
00:39:14,087 --> 00:39:16,362
Three different courts
found him guilty.

629
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,678
That's enough perspective for me.

630
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:47,079
DAY TWO

631
00:39:50,687 --> 00:39:52,439
What? 330... What?

632
00:39:53,087 --> 00:39:54,122
Seven.

633
00:39:55,447 --> 00:39:58,405
3303.

634
00:39:58,607 --> 00:40:00,040
3305.

635
00:40:00,527 --> 00:40:02,597
3307. Right there.

636
00:40:07,727 --> 00:40:08,876
Jesus, look at the sign.

637
00:40:22,967 --> 00:40:25,925
Hi. I'm Bitsey Bloom.
This is Zack Stemmons.

638
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:27,326
You want the tour?

639
00:40:28,847 --> 00:40:31,725
There's a $20
mandatory donation apiece.

640
00:40:32,047 --> 00:40:35,244
You get a re-enactment photo packet.
It's got five pictures.

641
00:40:35,447 --> 00:40:37,403
- Okay.
- I got to collect first.

642
00:40:37,487 --> 00:40:38,442
Sure.

643
00:40:39,367 --> 00:40:40,402
I got it.

644
00:40:43,807 --> 00:40:46,924
Got to sign the book. It doesn't
have to be your real name.

645
00:40:47,087 --> 00:40:49,806
It says you're here
to do research on violent crime.

646
00:40:49,887 --> 00:40:52,082
State requires it
for non-profit shit.

647
00:40:53,567 --> 00:40:55,558
Take a re-enactment photo packet.

648
00:40:56,047 --> 00:40:58,242
If you guys could share one,
it would be cool.

649
00:40:58,327 --> 00:41:00,682
The fuckers that do my prints
jerk my chain.

650
00:41:00,767 --> 00:41:03,076
That's me. My boyfriend took it.

651
00:41:03,367 --> 00:41:04,800
We also got a video.

652
00:41:05,127 --> 00:41:07,243
It's $50 'cause you can see my tits.

653
00:41:07,767 --> 00:41:10,122
There's a version without tits.
It's $35.

654
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:13,999
- Do many people take the tour?
- Not so much anymore.

655
00:41:14,287 --> 00:41:17,802
We thought it would be a busy week
with Gale getting the prune juice.

656
00:41:17,887 --> 00:41:19,957
So you don't mind living here?

657
00:41:20,047 --> 00:41:22,641
It's better than living
with my dickwad parents.

658
00:41:22,927 --> 00:41:24,360
It starts over here.

659
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:26,998
She let him crash here sometimes.

660
00:41:27,087 --> 00:41:28,884
He was constantly wasted.

661
00:41:28,967 --> 00:41:30,082
Exhibit one.

662
00:41:30,607 --> 00:41:32,359
He drank Scotch religiously.

663
00:41:33,487 --> 00:41:35,205
The rest is in the kitchen.

664
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:38,520
Here's number two.

665
00:41:38,927 --> 00:41:40,519
This is where the tripod was.

666
00:41:40,607 --> 00:41:43,405
My boyfriend borrowed the one
we usually show to folks.

667
00:41:43,487 --> 00:41:46,763
They never found a camera,
or photos, a video or anything.

668
00:41:47,207 --> 00:41:48,925
Gale must have buried them.

669
00:41:49,647 --> 00:41:53,196
These serial killer dudes
take photos to whack off to later.

670
00:41:53,847 --> 00:41:56,486
He's not exactly a serial killer.

671
00:41:57,527 --> 00:41:58,516
Whatever.

672
00:41:59,127 --> 00:42:01,402
She was totally naked, right here.

673
00:42:01,687 --> 00:42:03,882
The meter man
saw her through the door.

674
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:06,956
Gale handcuffed her,
taped her mouth...

675
00:42:07,047 --> 00:42:09,481
then taped a bag over her head
so she couldn't breathe.

676
00:42:09,567 --> 00:42:12,365
He used housewife gloves
so he wouldn't leave prints.

677
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:14,961
They found sticky stuff
from the tape on them.

678
00:42:15,087 --> 00:42:17,920
We ask folks
not to touch the exhibit.

679
00:42:19,087 --> 00:42:22,159
The totally sick part is where
they found the key to the handcuffs.

680
00:42:24,007 --> 00:42:24,962
We know.

681
00:42:25,047 --> 00:42:26,685
Wait. What? Where was it?

682
00:42:27,007 --> 00:42:28,759
It was in her stomach, dude.

683
00:42:28,967 --> 00:42:31,481
Gale made her swallow it
before he bagged her.

684
00:42:32,207 --> 00:42:34,243
That's pretty much the highlights.

685
00:42:35,447 --> 00:42:36,641
Got questions?

686
00:42:44,567 --> 00:42:46,762
I can still smell
the cigarette smoke.

687
00:42:47,487 --> 00:42:49,045
It's the barbecue!

688
00:42:51,607 --> 00:42:52,881
Can you imagine?

689
00:42:53,807 --> 00:42:55,559
That key was in her stomach.

690
00:42:55,647 --> 00:42:57,524
That's so fucking cold, man.

691
00:43:01,207 --> 00:43:02,322
Zack?
What?

692
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:06,202
Isn't that the cowboy
from the rest area?

693
00:43:08,887 --> 00:43:10,115
The same truck.

694
00:43:10,367 --> 00:43:11,720
Weird coincidence?

695
00:43:12,567 --> 00:43:16,037
Coincidences are always weird.
That's why they're coincidences.

696
00:43:21,287 --> 00:43:22,515
Off the record.

697
00:43:24,247 --> 00:43:25,646
Okay. We're off.

698
00:43:27,767 --> 00:43:31,077
Constance was murdered by what's
known as the Securitate Method.

699
00:43:31,727 --> 00:43:34,002
You're handcuffed,
forced to swallow the key...

700
00:43:34,087 --> 00:43:36,555
your mouth is taped,
a bag is sealed around your head...

701
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:38,080
and you're left to suffocate.

702
00:43:38,167 --> 00:43:39,759
The Securitate did it to Romanians...

703
00:43:39,847 --> 00:43:41,519
when they wouldn't inform
or confess.

704
00:43:41,607 --> 00:43:44,565
Sometimes the bag was ripped off
to give you a second chance.

705
00:43:44,647 --> 00:43:46,126
Otherwise, you died...

706
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:50,041
knowing that the key to your freedom
was inside of you the entire time.

707
00:43:50,487 --> 00:43:52,523
It's a cheap but effective method.

708
00:43:52,967 --> 00:43:54,161
The problem is...

709
00:43:57,927 --> 00:44:00,521
I once mentioned it
in an article that I wrote.

710
00:44:02,967 --> 00:44:04,719
Prosecution never knew that.

711
00:44:06,607 --> 00:44:09,246
- Someone's framing you?
- It's more than that.

712
00:44:11,007 --> 00:44:12,406
There was a tripod.

713
00:44:13,087 --> 00:44:14,042
Right.

714
00:44:15,127 --> 00:44:16,446
Facing her body.

715
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:18,798
- Are we back on the record?
- Yes.

716
00:44:19,447 --> 00:44:21,597
The tripod
had no fingerprints on it.

717
00:44:22,127 --> 00:44:25,039
That means somebody
brought it there, set it up...

718
00:44:25,367 --> 00:44:27,483
wiped it clean, and left it.

719
00:44:28,407 --> 00:44:29,362
Why?

720
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:32,798
It's as if they wanted me to know
that somewhere out there...

721
00:44:33,047 --> 00:44:35,766
is a record of exactly what happened
that afternoon.

722
00:44:35,927 --> 00:44:37,599
As if they wanted me to die...

723
00:44:37,687 --> 00:44:40,838
knowing that the key to my freedom
is out there somewhere.

724
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:45,199
Maybe you're being paranoid.

725
00:44:45,687 --> 00:44:48,918
I used to be the state's
leading death penalty abolitionist.

726
00:44:49,007 --> 00:44:52,238
Now I'm on death row! Doesn't that
strike you as a little odd?

727
00:44:54,127 --> 00:44:55,765
Any idea who "they" are?

728
00:44:57,087 --> 00:44:59,726
No, but I've got someone
working on that.

729
00:45:00,767 --> 00:45:03,235
Someone I'm relying on
to prove my innocence.

730
00:45:03,407 --> 00:45:05,125
Belyeu has hired a detective?

731
00:45:06,327 --> 00:45:07,521
A journalist.

732
00:45:08,687 --> 00:45:10,086
She has to help me.

733
00:45:14,327 --> 00:45:16,238
- You know I'm innocent.
- No.

734
00:45:20,327 --> 00:45:21,316
No, I don't.

735
00:45:30,967 --> 00:45:32,923
Wear me like a fur, Daddy.

736
00:45:33,007 --> 00:45:34,963
Okay, who's your hero?

737
00:45:35,767 --> 00:45:38,964
All right, you go get Cloud Dog.
Hey, Cloud Dog!

738
00:45:41,287 --> 00:45:42,845
Call me when you land.

739
00:45:44,607 --> 00:45:47,041
Has any couple ever really survived
a trial separation?

740
00:45:47,127 --> 00:45:49,687
Isn't it contrary to the idea
of trying to work things out?

741
00:45:49,767 --> 00:45:50,882
Don't.

742
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:53,725
Get in, sweetie.

743
00:45:56,327 --> 00:45:59,205
See you later, alligator.
After a while, crocodile.

744
00:45:59,287 --> 00:46:02,677
- Take it easy, Japa-nee-zee.
- Okey-dokey, artichokey.

745
00:46:03,607 --> 00:46:04,596
Scoot.

746
00:46:07,487 --> 00:46:09,842
- Listen.
- I sent you an e-mail.

747
00:46:11,767 --> 00:46:14,327
- An e-mail?
- Just read it.

748
00:46:25,527 --> 00:46:26,801
Come on, sweetie.

749
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:04,481
Just read it.

750
00:47:16,527 --> 00:47:18,597
You could at least hide
the bottle.

751
00:47:31,607 --> 00:47:32,562
Well?

752
00:47:34,047 --> 00:47:36,083
Officially, you're on sabbatical.

753
00:47:37,767 --> 00:47:40,076
Unofficially,
they want you out of here.

754
00:47:40,167 --> 00:47:41,566
It was four to two.

755
00:47:43,447 --> 00:47:44,766
How did Ross vote?

756
00:47:46,487 --> 00:47:47,966
I'm not supposed to...

757
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,482
Against you.

758
00:48:01,727 --> 00:48:02,716
And you?

759
00:48:04,287 --> 00:48:05,242
For you.

760
00:48:07,647 --> 00:48:09,239
And against my politics.

761
00:48:45,527 --> 00:48:46,801
Please.

762
00:48:46,887 --> 00:48:49,276
Madam, atencion.

763
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:52,795
My name is David Gale.

764
00:48:53,047 --> 00:48:54,958
I have phoned before, yes?

765
00:48:56,807 --> 00:48:57,762
Can...

766
00:49:00,447 --> 00:49:01,880
Por favor.

767
00:49:05,367 --> 00:49:06,846
What? No, never mind.

768
00:49:06,967 --> 00:49:09,686
Can you please get Sharon Gale?

769
00:49:10,407 --> 00:49:12,079
Yes, Miss Gale!

770
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:22,122
Hello?

771
00:49:39,967 --> 00:49:43,004
I wanted to hear your feedback
on the idea.

772
00:49:43,967 --> 00:49:45,525
Look, Professor Gale...

773
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:50,084
I could sit here like others have,
and plead departmental cutbacks...

774
00:49:50,527 --> 00:49:53,599
claim you need more publications,
I need a minority.

775
00:49:54,127 --> 00:49:55,276
Whatever.

776
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,085
All bull-geschichte.

777
00:49:58,327 --> 00:49:59,965
Your record's brilliant.

778
00:50:00,127 --> 00:50:03,961
You're an original voice, worth,
in today's scarcity-defines-value...

779
00:50:04,047 --> 00:50:07,164
capitalist system under which
we toil, your weight in gold.

780
00:50:08,287 --> 00:50:11,085
Hell, it's not even
your alcohol problem.

781
00:50:11,567 --> 00:50:15,355
It would be nice to have a faculty
member whose crutch wasn't Prozac.

782
00:50:16,127 --> 00:50:19,164
But to speak plain,
if I were to hire you...

783
00:50:19,407 --> 00:50:21,716
in the eyes of the regents,
the alumni...

784
00:50:21,807 --> 00:50:24,116
and every freshman
with an ear for gossip...

785
00:50:24,687 --> 00:50:26,518
I'd be hiring a rapist.

786
00:50:26,847 --> 00:50:28,599
Those charges were dropped.

787
00:50:28,847 --> 00:50:31,122
People would say
you had a good lawyer.

788
00:50:32,047 --> 00:50:33,275
I was innocent.

789
00:50:34,167 --> 00:50:35,566
You don't get it, do you?

790
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:38,081
You're not politically correct.

791
00:50:38,647 --> 00:50:40,080
Welcome to the club.

792
00:50:43,247 --> 00:50:45,636
Socrates is sentenced to death.

793
00:50:47,887 --> 00:50:50,685
I bet you didn't know that.
He was sentenced to death.

794
00:50:50,767 --> 00:50:54,521
But Athenian law
let the condemned...

795
00:50:54,647 --> 00:50:57,081
come up with their own
alternate punishment.

796
00:50:57,647 --> 00:50:59,080
Isn't that a great idea?

797
00:50:59,167 --> 00:51:01,886
Where are the Athenians
when you really need them?

798
00:51:03,487 --> 00:51:04,920
So anyway, Socrates...

799
00:51:05,527 --> 00:51:07,404
And he was ugly. Did I mention that?

800
00:51:07,487 --> 00:51:10,126
Did I mention
that Socrates was ugly?

801
00:51:10,527 --> 00:51:14,884
Socrates was ugly, Plato was fat,
and Aristotle was a prissy dresser.

802
00:51:16,447 --> 00:51:19,837
So anyway,
Socrates comes up with this idea.

803
00:51:19,967 --> 00:51:23,926
He says, "What if I pay a fine
instead of death?"

804
00:51:24,127 --> 00:51:25,560
He suggests a fine.

805
00:51:25,647 --> 00:51:29,879
All he has to do in order to live is
to come up with an appropriately...

806
00:51:29,967 --> 00:51:31,480
punitive figure.

807
00:51:33,567 --> 00:51:36,445
Guess what he suggested? $30!

808
00:51:40,407 --> 00:51:42,762
Does that make any sense? $30.

809
00:51:42,847 --> 00:51:45,486
That's 30 mina. That was
the currency of the day, a mina.

810
00:51:45,567 --> 00:51:46,716
Well, minae.

811
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,760
That's plural. Minae.

812
00:51:50,047 --> 00:51:51,002
$30!

813
00:51:51,927 --> 00:51:53,565
Thirty pieces of silver.

814
00:51:54,327 --> 00:51:58,115
And the judges are so pissed that
more of them voted to kill him...

815
00:51:58,207 --> 00:52:00,004
than had voted him guilty
in the first place.

816
00:52:00,087 --> 00:52:01,884
That doesn't make any sense.

817
00:52:02,847 --> 00:52:04,439
Thirty pieces of silver.

818
00:52:05,127 --> 00:52:06,640
Just like the Judas guy.

819
00:52:06,727 --> 00:52:08,126
The Jesus-kisser...

820
00:52:08,767 --> 00:52:10,644
who was also a prissy dresser.

821
00:52:51,887 --> 00:52:55,197
Without a successful completion
of an alcohol treatment program...

822
00:52:55,287 --> 00:52:56,925
you can forget visitation.

823
00:52:57,527 --> 00:52:59,802
You'll be lucky
to get a Christmas card.

824
00:53:00,047 --> 00:53:02,436
That's if there
even is a custody hearing.

825
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:05,316
What does that mean?

826
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:07,762
If your wife
convinces a Spanish court...

827
00:53:07,927 --> 00:53:11,158
that you're a danger to the child,
you'll never see him again.

828
00:53:12,287 --> 00:53:15,040
He just has to come home.
He's got to come back.

829
00:53:15,127 --> 00:53:17,277
Pete, can we
have another round here?

830
00:53:19,207 --> 00:53:20,276
I'm fine.

831
00:53:25,087 --> 00:53:26,520
I'll just have to go get him then.

832
00:53:26,607 --> 00:53:29,838
Europe's not Mexico, David.
They've got real borders over there.

833
00:53:29,967 --> 00:53:33,403
You might be able to get in,
but getting out with a 6-year-old?

834
00:53:34,367 --> 00:53:36,835
That's a whole different
kettle of crawdads.

835
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:39,125
You want to see Jamie again?

836
00:53:39,207 --> 00:53:41,596
- Then you get your life together.
- I'm fine.

837
00:53:42,567 --> 00:53:43,602
Pronto.

838
00:53:53,127 --> 00:53:54,560
Who wants to start?

839
00:54:04,127 --> 00:54:06,595
Hi, my name is David...

840
00:54:07,807 --> 00:54:09,126
and I am an alcoholic.

841
00:54:09,207 --> 00:54:12,085
AA GROUP Hi, David.

842
00:54:17,407 --> 00:54:19,602
So, Mr. Gale...

843
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:23,487
tell me three personal qualities...

844
00:54:23,567 --> 00:54:25,398
that you feel you have...

845
00:54:25,487 --> 00:54:27,955
that would make you
a successful Radio Shed manager.

846
00:54:30,007 --> 00:54:30,996
Three.

847
00:54:34,687 --> 00:54:35,642
Okay.

848
00:55:16,447 --> 00:55:17,562
I'm sorry.

849
00:55:21,167 --> 00:55:22,998
I'm sorry. Welcome back.

850
00:55:23,127 --> 00:55:24,082
Thanks.

851
00:55:24,847 --> 00:55:26,565
You look good.
I feel good.

852
00:55:28,327 --> 00:55:30,522
There's something
that you've got to see.

853
00:55:31,087 --> 00:55:32,884
Betty Sue Johnson
has been rescheduled.

854
00:55:32,967 --> 00:55:34,719
Her execution date
is set for the eighth.

855
00:55:34,807 --> 00:55:36,763
I have a call
with Washington tonight.

856
00:55:36,847 --> 00:55:39,077
If the national director
commits to emergency funds...

857
00:55:39,167 --> 00:55:41,237
She gets commuted
and you prove the system works.

858
00:55:41,327 --> 00:55:42,806
But I'll save a life.

859
00:55:43,527 --> 00:55:45,279
Where did you get that bruise?

860
00:55:45,607 --> 00:55:47,325
Just doing chores.

861
00:55:47,647 --> 00:55:49,877
Is your cowboy
getting rough with you?

862
00:55:53,967 --> 00:55:55,082
There he is.

863
00:55:55,327 --> 00:55:58,558
Dusty, does she ever invite you over
and not put you to work?

864
00:56:02,447 --> 00:56:04,483
All right, tell me her story.

865
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:06,563
She was sentenced at 17.

866
00:56:06,767 --> 00:56:09,600
I really want to get behind
this one. She's so articulate.

867
00:56:09,687 --> 00:56:10,722
Who did she kill?

868
00:56:10,807 --> 00:56:12,320
She'll put a face
on the death penalty.

869
00:56:12,527 --> 00:56:14,722
Constance, who did she kill?

870
00:56:15,527 --> 00:56:16,482
A cop.

871
00:56:17,167 --> 00:56:18,236
You're crazy.

872
00:56:18,327 --> 00:56:21,399
Not just your medium-range,
thinks-she's- Roosevelt's- bathrobe...

873
00:56:21,487 --> 00:56:25,321
but I mean stark-raving,
screws-loose, in-the-belfry insane!

874
00:56:25,407 --> 00:56:26,886
Seventeen.

875
00:56:27,447 --> 00:56:29,802
Four years before she could
legally drink a beer.

876
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:31,764
But she killed a cop, Constance.

877
00:56:31,847 --> 00:56:33,758
Will you help?
Of course.

878
00:56:35,527 --> 00:56:36,880
You're burning up.

879
00:56:48,807 --> 00:56:49,683
Hi, Mr. Gale.

880
00:56:49,767 --> 00:56:51,678
How are you? It's good to see...

881
00:57:03,847 --> 00:57:05,758
Caffeine jolt. We deliver.

882
00:57:05,847 --> 00:57:07,485
Howdy, David.
Howdy, folks.

883
00:57:07,567 --> 00:57:10,365
Hello. My, this is service.
Thank you.

884
00:57:10,447 --> 00:57:12,642
Gladly. Latte on the left there
for you, John.

885
00:57:12,727 --> 00:57:14,080
Mocha.
Thanks.

886
00:57:15,047 --> 00:57:19,006
- She's on the phone to Washington.
- Sinclair, new National Director.

887
00:57:21,967 --> 00:57:24,527
I'm sure we can get some
pulpit time, maybe some cable.

888
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,404
DIRECTOR
Good. I need to go.

889
00:57:26,487 --> 00:57:30,082
I agree the first press release
should focus on the woman's youth.

890
00:57:30,207 --> 00:57:32,437
I'll have Washington
look into counsel competency.

891
00:57:32,527 --> 00:57:35,360
Though I'm almost sure
she's exhausted this on appeal.

892
00:57:35,447 --> 00:57:37,677
- See what resources...
- David's going to go.

893
00:57:37,767 --> 00:57:40,156
I almost forgot.
Gale's not around, is he?

894
00:57:41,247 --> 00:57:43,636
- No.
- Good. Keep it that way.

895
00:57:43,727 --> 00:57:46,161
His relationship
with DeathWatch is over.

896
00:57:46,247 --> 00:57:49,159
Last thing we need is this
rape thing coming back to bite us.

897
00:57:49,247 --> 00:57:51,283
These guys don't stay
on the wagon for long.

898
00:57:51,887 --> 00:57:53,286
I'm serious, Constance.

899
00:57:53,367 --> 00:57:56,279
Ban him from the premises.
I realise the two of you...

900
00:58:03,407 --> 00:58:04,442
David!

901
00:58:20,807 --> 00:58:23,958
Sharon, pick up the phone.
I'm begging you.

902
00:58:24,647 --> 00:58:26,285
He's my son, all right?

903
00:58:26,367 --> 00:58:28,676
He's my son, too,
and I want to talk to him.

904
00:58:28,767 --> 00:58:30,519
You've not let... Hello?

905
00:58:30,887 --> 00:58:33,037
Jamie, is that you?

906
00:58:33,127 --> 00:58:35,641
Hey, little moose horn.

907
00:58:36,407 --> 00:58:38,238
I miss you so much. It's Daddy.

908
00:58:41,127 --> 00:58:44,199
Jamie, wait.
Don't hang up the phone!

909
00:58:45,727 --> 00:58:46,796
God damn it!

910
00:58:56,047 --> 00:58:57,275
Oh, fuck!

911
00:59:45,767 --> 00:59:46,995
You scared me.

912
00:59:47,487 --> 00:59:49,125
My sheep needs a manager.

913
00:59:50,007 --> 00:59:51,042
A manger.

914
00:59:51,207 --> 00:59:52,925
My sheep needs a manger.

915
00:59:54,287 --> 00:59:55,720
Are you okay?

916
00:59:58,287 --> 01:00:00,517
I fell off the wagon
and I hurt myself.

917
01:00:02,447 --> 01:00:03,926
Come on inside.

918
01:00:09,567 --> 01:00:12,798
Do you know why St. Jude
is the patron saint of lost causes?

919
01:00:13,367 --> 01:00:15,278
'Cause his real name was Judas.

920
01:00:16,247 --> 01:00:18,681
Judas! There were two Judases.

921
01:00:19,207 --> 01:00:22,882
Judae, who was the saint guy,
and then the other one...

922
01:00:23,567 --> 01:00:25,444
Judas, who was the bad one.

923
01:00:25,607 --> 01:00:28,679
He's the one who ratted out Jesus
and tried to kiss him.

924
01:00:29,287 --> 01:00:32,085
In medieval times, they would never
pray to the good Judas...

925
01:00:32,167 --> 01:00:35,204
for fear of getting the bad Judas
on the line just by mistake.

926
01:00:35,287 --> 01:00:37,960
Ergo, they never really
gave him business...

927
01:00:38,047 --> 01:00:39,844
unless absolutely desperate.

928
01:00:41,127 --> 01:00:44,244
That's why.
And then they changed his name.

929
01:00:44,887 --> 01:00:46,605
Your mail is blowing.

930
01:00:58,807 --> 01:00:59,762
Oh, shit.

931
01:01:05,167 --> 01:01:08,045
Are you the doctor?
What's wrong with her?

932
01:01:08,127 --> 01:01:09,003
She'll be fine.

933
01:01:09,087 --> 01:01:11,043
- How do you know?
- Calm down.

934
01:01:11,127 --> 01:01:14,517
She was opening her mail and fell
over. I don't know what's wrong.

935
01:01:14,607 --> 01:01:17,485
Please. Is there a doctor?
Wait here.

936
01:01:17,567 --> 01:01:19,842
I have to go with her!
Hold up, Professor!

937
01:01:19,927 --> 01:01:21,804
You want to get arrested again?

938
01:01:24,167 --> 01:01:25,805
How do you know who I am?

939
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:28,003
I watch the news. Now go wait.

940
01:02:02,887 --> 01:02:05,162
How're we doing?
Fine. How's Constance?

941
01:02:05,287 --> 01:02:06,242
Sleeping.

942
01:02:07,487 --> 01:02:09,125
A leukaemia patient's
condition is...

943
01:02:09,207 --> 01:02:10,720
very susceptible
to external stress...

944
01:02:10,807 --> 01:02:11,683
What?

945
01:02:13,447 --> 01:02:16,598
Constance's illness requires
a degree of regularity.

946
01:02:19,687 --> 01:02:21,279
Constance has leukaemia?

947
01:02:23,127 --> 01:02:24,446
You didn't know?

948
01:02:26,967 --> 01:02:28,002
Wait.

949
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:33,596
No, I didn't.

950
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:45,076
It's funny how selfish
we can be, isn't it?

951
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:51,317
When I first heard Constance
was dying, I was so mad at her.

952
01:02:53,527 --> 01:02:55,245
I thought,
"How can you do this to me?

953
01:02:55,327 --> 01:02:58,478
"I mean, you know how hard
it is for me to need other people. "

954
01:03:01,247 --> 01:03:02,885
Why hadn't she told you?

955
01:03:04,927 --> 01:03:06,599
She said she was too busy.

956
01:03:09,407 --> 01:03:11,398
I guess since death
was chasing her...

957
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:13,478
she wanted to help
other people avoid it.

958
01:03:18,287 --> 01:03:20,357
That's what she did with her life.

959
01:03:23,607 --> 01:03:28,044
Constance left this world
a better place than she found it.

960
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:34,399
It's a small but difficult thing.
