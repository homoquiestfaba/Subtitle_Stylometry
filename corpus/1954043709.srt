1
00:00:55,614 --> 00:00:58,325
At the far reaches of the universe...

2
00:00:58,534 --> 00:01:03,121
... Iies a planet of men who have[br]advanced technologically...

3
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,667
...beyond the realm[br]of human comprehension.

4
00:01:07,605 --> 00:01:12,193
There is no breeding.[br]They are a product of cloning...

5
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:17,615
...and their reproductive organs[br]have shrunk and disappeared.

6
00:01:19,388 --> 00:01:22,933
All emotions have been bred[br]out of this race...

7
00:01:23,246 --> 00:01:25,331
...and each succeeding generation...

8
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:30,649
...has become more ambitious[br]and driven than the previous one.

9
00:01:31,796 --> 00:01:34,090
They want to rule the universe...

10
00:01:34,298 --> 00:01:39,408
...and now they are planning[br]their next takeover from the inside.

11
00:02:01,096 --> 00:02:04,537
This planet is four solar systems[br]from our own.

12
00:02:04,745 --> 00:02:09,125
Across the Sea of Vell,[br]at a fixed position of 1 3-6-90...

13
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:12,148
...on the subset grid 4-1 0.

14
00:02:12,357 --> 00:02:14,964
It is a solid, rigid mass...

15
00:02:15,172 --> 00:02:18,822
...with a dense core[br]of magnetic, metallic liquid.

16
00:02:19,343 --> 00:02:23,827
The atmosphere is composed[br]of nitrogen, oxygen and argon...

17
00:02:24,035 --> 00:02:29,145
...in amounts of 78, 21[br]and 1 percent by volume.

18
00:02:29,874 --> 00:02:32,377
This is our target.

19
00:02:33,003 --> 00:02:35,192
This is Earth.

20
00:02:35,505 --> 00:02:38,216
This is where one of you[br]will serve your planet...

21
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:40,719
...to the act of procreation.

22
00:02:41,136 --> 00:02:43,430
Your training will be extensive.

23
00:02:44,577 --> 00:02:49,686
The Earth woman's reproductive organs[br]are located here.

24
00:02:51,354 --> 00:02:54,587
The access point is here.

25
00:02:54,795 --> 00:02:59,904
Insertion in any other access point[br]will not result in pregnancy.

26
00:03:00,843 --> 00:03:05,014
To get the woman in a receptive mood[br]for insertion...

27
00:03:05,222 --> 00:03:08,559
... compliment her on these areas.

28
00:03:13,877 --> 00:03:16,171
She will also enjoy being told...

29
00:03:16,588 --> 00:03:21,697
... that she smells nice[br]and that her footwear is stylish.

30
00:03:21,905 --> 00:03:24,304
You will spend many hours in study...

31
00:03:24,512 --> 00:03:28,266
...trying to learn all you can[br]about the females of this planet.

32
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:33,584
It is important to a woman that she[br]feels you are listening when she speaks.

33
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:36,295
This is most easily achieved...

34
00:03:36,503 --> 00:03:41,613
...by repeating the phrase, "uh-huh, "[br]when the woman is communicating.

35
00:03:43,281 --> 00:03:44,949
I went to the store this morning.

36
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,200
Uh-huh.

37
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:50,371
On the way, the car started making[br]a funny noise, so I pulled over.

38
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,622
Uh-huh.

39
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,751
Then I couldn't hear it,[br]so I started driving again.

40
00:03:56,523 --> 00:03:57,774
Then it was fine.

41
00:03:59,547 --> 00:04:03,509
You will familiarize yourself with[br]her predilections, her customs...

42
00:04:03,718 --> 00:04:05,386
...her ranges of temperament.

43
00:04:05,595 --> 00:04:09,974
Her smiles, her frowns.[br]Her ups and her downs.

44
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,685
-Your footwear is quite fashionable.[br]-Thank you.

45
00:04:12,894 --> 00:04:14,562
May I insert my penis in you?

46
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:16,230
Yes.

47
00:04:17,377 --> 00:04:21,757
Ten seconds.[br]This time is your personal best.

48
00:04:21,965 --> 00:04:23,946
Congratulations.

49
00:04:27,179 --> 00:04:29,160
You all have performed admirably...

50
00:04:29,473 --> 00:04:32,288
...and your concentration[br]has been exemplary...

51
00:04:32,496 --> 00:04:35,729
...but one man has been chosen.

52
00:04:35,937 --> 00:04:38,336
This man has excelled[br]in his training...

53
00:04:38,648 --> 00:04:42,611
...and we are confident that women[br]of Earth will be both interested in...

54
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:46,364
...and willing to experience[br]insertion with him.

55
00:04:46,782 --> 00:04:48,137
This man...

56
00:04:48,346 --> 00:04:52,933
...is H-1 449-6.

57
00:05:00,024 --> 00:05:03,778
Congratulations, H-1 449-6.

58
00:05:03,986 --> 00:05:06,697
Or, as you'll now be referred to,[br]Harold Anderson...

59
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:08,470
...from Seattle, Washington.

60
00:05:08,678 --> 00:05:11,494
We've given you a wealth[br]of information about Earth...

61
00:05:11,702 --> 00:05:13,579
...but her people are unpredictable.

62
00:05:13,788 --> 00:05:16,499
As with all alien cultures,[br]there will be subtleties...

63
00:05:16,707 --> 00:05:18,584
...which we couldn't prepare you for.

64
00:05:18,793 --> 00:05:22,755
However, given your adaptability[br]and your capacity for learning...

65
00:05:22,963 --> 00:05:25,883
...we're certain you'll achieve[br]your goal with ease.

66
00:05:26,091 --> 00:05:30,262
The success of our planet's domination[br]of the universe rests in your hands.

67
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:31,514
Thank you, sir.

68
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:34,850
If you go with these men,[br]we'll arrange your transfer...

69
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:36,831
...and attach your penis.

70
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:00,709
We will begin our descent into[br]the Phoenix area in about 30 minutes.

71
00:06:01,022 --> 00:06:05,714
Flight crew will be by shortly[br]to pick up all food and beverage items.

72
00:06:06,027 --> 00:06:09,364
Thank you once again[br]for flying Arizona West.

73
00:06:14,473 --> 00:06:15,516
What is that?

74
00:06:16,246 --> 00:06:17,288
What?

75
00:06:18,227 --> 00:06:20,521
There. Inbound at our 2:00.

76
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:22,502
-It's moving.[br]-Tell me where to go.

77
00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:30,948
Hydraulics?

78
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:35,223
Landing hydraulics okay.[br]Wing and tail hydraulics okay.

79
00:06:35,431 --> 00:06:38,455
-We're losing altitude.[br]-Air speed is dropping.

80
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:39,915
What the hell is this?

81
00:06:40,123 --> 00:06:43,252
Collision alert. Collision alert.

82
00:06:43,773 --> 00:06:44,816
It's on us!

83
00:06:56,494 --> 00:06:58,996
Simple people.[br]They're 1 000 years behind us.

84
00:06:59,205 --> 00:07:02,125
They haven't figured out that round[br]is the most efficient way to fly.

85
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,689
This will be a snap.

86
00:07:03,897 --> 00:07:06,608
-Remember, get a woman pregnant.[br]-Give me two days.

87
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:09,111
Wait for the baby and then come back.

88
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:12,343
Whatever you do,[br]don't let anyone know the truth.

89
00:07:12,552 --> 00:07:14,741
We don't want another Roswell[br]on our hands.

90
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:18,808
That happened because you made[br]the mistake of sending H-228-J.

91
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:21,832
That guy was an idiot[br]and not as handsome as me.

92
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,500
Nowhere near.

93
00:07:39,975 --> 00:07:41,226
Hi. Hi.

94
00:07:42,581 --> 00:07:45,710
-Hey there. Hey, I like your shoes.[br]-What?

95
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:47,274
Let me give you a hand.

96
00:07:47,482 --> 00:07:49,985
Take your seat[br]and fasten your seat belt.

97
00:07:50,193 --> 00:07:51,132
" Rebecca."

98
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:55,407
I always wanted my children to have[br]a mother named Rebecca. Interested?

99
00:07:55,615 --> 00:07:56,867
Are you all right?

100
00:07:57,075 --> 00:08:02,184
Well, to be honest, I am a little[br]lightheaded from that perfume.

101
00:08:02,393 --> 00:08:03,644
You smell nice.

102
00:08:04,374 --> 00:08:08,128
Sir, if you don't take your seat,[br]I'll report you when we land.

103
00:08:08,336 --> 00:08:10,422
Ouch. Kitty likes to scratch.

104
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,052
Anyone sitting here?

105
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,536
Well, there is now. Hi.

106
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:25,645
-You're shaking.[br]-I thought we'd crash.

107
00:08:26,062 --> 00:08:29,190
I like it when a woman shakes.[br]Turns me on.

108
00:08:29,816 --> 00:08:30,859
What?

109
00:08:33,465 --> 00:08:35,342
-I like your shoes.[br]-Thank you.

110
00:08:35,551 --> 00:08:37,532
-And you smell nice.[br]-Thank you.

111
00:08:37,741 --> 00:08:39,617
Going to Phoenix[br]on business or pleasure?

112
00:08:39,826 --> 00:08:41,911
I'm going to see my husband.

113
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,457
He's a pharmacist. He works[br]in the pharmaceutical industry.

114
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,272
We had a fight before this flight.

115
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,713
You shouldn't fly without saying[br]"Sorry" or " I love you."

116
00:08:52,026 --> 00:08:54,737
If I'd died,[br]he'd still think I was pissed off.

117
00:09:21,951 --> 00:09:24,141
Hey, watch the cart, man!

118
00:09:24,349 --> 00:09:28,729
Do you want me to get you a copy of[br]the FAA rules and regulations, asswipe?

119
00:09:28,937 --> 00:09:33,317
I do my job, then you do yours.[br]Stay out of my way!

120
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:37,279
They'll give anybody a fucking badge.

121
00:09:37,487 --> 00:09:39,052
-Hello, Mr. Jones.[br]-What we got?

122
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:43,014
It could be bad air, but judging[br]from what I've heard from the crew...

123
00:09:43,327 --> 00:09:45,725
...it sounds a little[br]out of the ordinary.

124
00:09:45,933 --> 00:09:48,332
-How long you been with the department?[br]-Three months.

125
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,251
I'll do you a favour.[br]It's never out of the ordinary.

126
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,484
It's either a flock of geese,[br]a weather balloon...

127
00:09:54,692 --> 00:09:57,507
...or if it's Friday,[br]the crew is drunk.

128
00:09:58,654 --> 00:10:01,261
Nadine, what'd I say[br]about using this number?

129
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,806
I said never to call this number[br]unless the house is on fire...

130
00:10:05,015 --> 00:10:08,039
...and I don't hear a siren,[br]so this better be good.

131
00:10:08,873 --> 00:10:12,939
Yeah, I know today's our anniversary.[br]What makes you think I forgot?

132
00:10:13,148 --> 00:10:18,153
How do you know I'm not coming home[br]with a bunch of flowers or something?

133
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:19,717
How do you know that?

134
00:10:19,926 --> 00:10:21,385
Nadine, don't cry.

135
00:10:22,011 --> 00:10:23,471
Bye-bye.

136
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,277
Bye-bye.

137
00:10:39,528 --> 00:10:42,656
A passenger shot some video[br]when the incident took place.

138
00:10:42,865 --> 00:10:44,742
You might want to look at it.

139
00:10:45,368 --> 00:10:48,913
Get a list of passengers and crew.[br]Check the cabin, write your report.

140
00:10:49,121 --> 00:10:52,666
And if you see anything at all[br]interesting, just remember:

141
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:54,752
It's not.

142
00:10:57,671 --> 00:11:01,008
Well, Christmas is early this year.

143
00:11:01,217 --> 00:11:02,885
You guys twins?

144
00:11:03,093 --> 00:11:04,553
Asshole.

145
00:11:06,743 --> 00:11:08,516
Can you contribute to the mission?

146
00:11:08,828 --> 00:11:11,018
What can I get for 1 50 bucks,[br]gorgeous?

147
00:11:27,701 --> 00:11:29,370
What's that noise?

148
00:11:29,578 --> 00:11:30,725
I don't hear anything.

149
00:11:32,706 --> 00:11:34,062
It's coming from your pants.

150
00:11:34,687 --> 00:11:38,963
There's something else that comes out[br]of my pants. Want to see?

151
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:45,010
Keep the change.

152
00:11:45,219 --> 00:11:47,096
-Can I have your autograph?[br]-What?

153
00:11:47,304 --> 00:11:50,224
-You are Miss America, aren't you?[br]-Yeah.

154
00:11:50,537 --> 00:11:52,101
Who are you? Mr. Universe?

155
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:53,769
Hey, where you headed?

156
00:11:53,977 --> 00:11:55,437
Chicago.

157
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:57,835
That's attractive.

158
00:11:58,044 --> 00:12:00,964
The Windy City.[br]So what time's your flight?

159
00:12:01,172 --> 00:12:02,528
Forty minutes.

160
00:12:02,736 --> 00:12:04,822
I don't know what you're doing[br]until then...

161
00:12:05,134 --> 00:12:07,637
...but there's a Hilton[br]across the street.

162
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:11,808
I don't know if they have[br]a 40-minute rate or not, but...

163
00:12:12,538 --> 00:12:13,997
...maybe we could--

164
00:12:16,604 --> 00:12:17,855
Taxi!

165
00:12:45,591 --> 00:12:48,094
-I know who you are.[br]-You do?

166
00:12:48,615 --> 00:12:50,388
I know where you're from too.

167
00:12:51,013 --> 00:12:52,265
Really?

168
00:12:52,577 --> 00:12:55,080
New guy from Seattle.[br]Commercial and home loans.

169
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:57,374
-How did you know?[br]-My gut.

170
00:12:57,582 --> 00:12:59,772
Perry Gordon.[br]Commercial and home loans too.

171
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:01,753
Nice to meet you.[br]Harold Anderson.

172
00:13:01,962 --> 00:13:04,881
Word is, you're some[br]big banking kahuna from up north.

173
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,175
Your letters of recommendation[br]were unbelievable.

174
00:13:07,384 --> 00:13:08,844
They're not that great.

175
00:13:09,052 --> 00:13:13,014
They were. I snuck into Mr. Fisk's[br]office, read every single one.

176
00:13:13,223 --> 00:13:15,100
-Who's that?[br]-That's Rita.

177
00:13:16,038 --> 00:13:18,541
Office manager. I got her a job.

178
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,835
Smartest thing I ever did.

179
00:13:22,816 --> 00:13:24,797
-Is she--[br]-Too late. All mine.

180
00:13:26,153 --> 00:13:29,281
She's a noisy one too.[br]Thank God we work in a bank.

181
00:13:29,489 --> 00:13:31,887
Close the vault door,[br]nobody hears a thing.

182
00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:33,451
She have a friend?

183
00:13:34,077 --> 00:13:36,788
Don't know. When you want to hit[br]the nightspots, call me.

184
00:13:36,997 --> 00:13:38,561
Thanks. Great. How about now?

185
00:13:42,106 --> 00:13:43,670
-You're kidding, right?[br]-No.

186
00:13:44,713 --> 00:13:47,007
It's 1 0 a.m.[br]You haven't met the boss yet.

187
00:13:47,215 --> 00:13:48,362
So?

188
00:13:49,092 --> 00:13:51,386
-You got some balls on you.[br]-I sure do.

189
00:13:51,595 --> 00:13:53,263
Two of them, below my penis.

190
00:13:54,931 --> 00:13:56,078
Listen.

191
00:13:57,329 --> 00:13:59,728
I've gotta have sex right away.

192
00:13:59,936 --> 00:14:01,709
I'm really, really horny.

193
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,898
-I'm getting that.[br]-Anderson?

194
00:14:04,628 --> 00:14:05,984
Yes, sir?

195
00:14:06,609 --> 00:14:10,259
I've been waiting for you. Don Fisk.[br]Come on in.

196
00:14:10,572 --> 00:14:11,614
Good morning, Mr. Fisk.

197
00:14:13,596 --> 00:14:14,743
This way.

198
00:14:23,293 --> 00:14:27,046
--as long as the contractionary[br]British fiscal policy continues.

199
00:14:27,985 --> 00:14:31,009
I can see we don't need[br]any time to get acclimated.

200
00:14:31,322 --> 00:14:32,364
Pretty girl.

201
00:14:33,407 --> 00:14:36,118
That's Rita, the office manager.[br]She's mine.

202
00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:41,644
We go to Scottsdale every weekend.[br]I have a condo up there.

203
00:14:42,061 --> 00:14:43,938
You're free to use it anytime.

204
00:14:44,147 --> 00:14:45,502
-Rita?[br]-The condo.

205
00:14:46,232 --> 00:14:48,005
-Thanks.[br]-You know...

206
00:14:48,318 --> 00:14:51,759
...l have never seen such a stack[br]of glowing recommendations.

207
00:14:51,967 --> 00:14:54,991
If I didn't know better,[br]I'd think you wrote them yourself.

208
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:01,873
A vice president's job is opening up.[br]I assume you're interested.

209
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,645
No, not necessarily.

210
00:15:03,854 --> 00:15:06,982
Come on. It's okay to be ambitious.[br]You're only human.

211
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:08,233
Well....

212
00:15:08,442 --> 00:15:10,527
Think it over. In the meantime...

213
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:12,717
-...welcome aboard.[br]-Thanks.

214
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:16,679
We got a wonderful family[br]of people here. Top-quality people.

215
00:15:16,888 --> 00:15:19,390
Except for Perry.[br]He's a sneaky prick.

216
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:22,101
Always looking for pussy,[br]never doing his job.

217
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:25,125
-I can't stand that.[br]-That is good to know.

218
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,547
Neglected? Nadine, how can you[br]feel neglected?

219
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,320
We never do anything?

220
00:15:32,528 --> 00:15:36,282
What about that trip to New Orleans?[br]Wasn't that a good time?

221
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:41,704
I don't care if it was four years ago.[br]I asked if it was a good time.

222
00:15:42,955 --> 00:15:45,562
Just don't get all pissy, will you?

223
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,794
I can't even ask you a question.[br]Could you hold?

224
00:15:50,046 --> 00:15:52,444
Can you hold, please? Thank you.

225
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:54,425
Jones.

226
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:57,970
No, that's closed.[br]Pacific East flight 769.

227
00:15:58,283 --> 00:16:00,056
Yeah, it was the hydraulics.

228
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:04,644
Arizona West flight 442. I was just[br]getting through that stuff. Hold on.

229
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:10,483
I'll have to call you back.[br]Let me call you back.

230
00:16:20,284 --> 00:16:21,744
What the hell?

231
00:16:33,109 --> 00:16:36,238
You like? This is[br]the best titty bar in Phoenix.

232
00:16:36,446 --> 00:16:37,384
How many are there?

233
00:16:37,593 --> 00:16:40,513
This one, and there might be[br]one other, but it sucks.

234
00:16:42,077 --> 00:16:43,432
You come here a lot?

235
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:45,100
Once, twice a year.

236
00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:46,560
-Hi, Perry.[br]-Hey, Cheryl.

237
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:49,063
-Grab me a beer.[br]-Sure. What would you like?

238
00:16:49,688 --> 00:16:50,835
Someone just like you.

239
00:16:52,087 --> 00:16:53,129
Relative?

240
00:16:55,945 --> 00:16:57,613
I'm your cowboy, baby.

241
00:16:57,926 --> 00:17:00,324
Great, but that noise is[br]getting louder.

242
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:01,575
Traffic.

243
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:04,078
-Are you sure?[br]-It's rush hour.

244
00:17:04,286 --> 00:17:06,580
Come on. Make me feel like a man.

245
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:10,230
Hold on, mister.[br]Time to put on your party clothes.

246
00:17:10,438 --> 00:17:11,585
What's that?

247
00:17:11,794 --> 00:17:12,836
A condom.

248
00:17:13,462 --> 00:17:16,069
My boss has one in Scottsdale.[br]He said I can use it.

249
00:17:17,112 --> 00:17:18,676
Great. Put it on.

250
00:17:18,988 --> 00:17:21,178
But I don't want anything between us.

251
00:17:21,595 --> 00:17:23,368
Just unroll it.

252
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:31,814
Oh, boy.

253
00:17:34,108 --> 00:17:35,984
What the hell was that?

254
00:17:36,193 --> 00:17:37,861
It slipped.

255
00:17:39,321 --> 00:17:40,677
-Morning.[br]-Morning.

256
00:17:41,824 --> 00:17:43,075
How'd it go with Cheryl?

257
00:17:43,283 --> 00:17:46,724
I rushed her to the hospital.[br]She got some glass in her eye.

258
00:17:47,037 --> 00:17:48,497
Yeah, that happens.

259
00:17:50,582 --> 00:17:52,042
Where we going tonight?

260
00:17:52,251 --> 00:17:56,004
I'll take you to a great place.[br]I'm taking you where I met Rita.

261
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:58,507
I'm Doreen. I'm an alcoholic.

262
00:17:58,715 --> 00:18:00,071
Hi, Doreen.

263
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:03,825
And today marks my 59th day[br]of sobriety.

264
00:18:06,327 --> 00:18:08,100
Thanks. Thank you very much.

265
00:18:08,308 --> 00:18:11,019
And I celebrated by[br]calling my parents...

266
00:18:11,228 --> 00:18:14,669
...to tell them about[br]my engagement to Janice.

267
00:18:15,816 --> 00:18:19,674
Dykes. Made popular on television,[br]now they're everywhere.

268
00:18:19,987 --> 00:18:22,281
Is there anyone else[br]who'd like to share?

269
00:18:24,053 --> 00:18:25,200
You.

270
00:18:27,494 --> 00:18:30,622
Hello. Get the bread,[br]I see something tasty.

271
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:34,897
Hi, this is the first time I've[br]actually gotten up to speak, so I'm--

272
00:18:35,106 --> 00:18:37,400
Your name. Start with your name.

273
00:18:38,547 --> 00:18:42,092
Thanks. Of course.[br]I'm sorry. I'm Susan.

274
00:18:43,552 --> 00:18:45,011
Hi, Susan.

275
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:49,391
Anyway, I'm an alcoholic.

276
00:18:50,121 --> 00:18:52,832
I've been sober[br]a couple of months now.

277
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:55,543
Thanks. That's okay.

278
00:18:59,088 --> 00:19:01,695
My father was an abusive alcoholic.

279
00:19:02,425 --> 00:19:06,387
And I guess maybe I'm lucky[br]that he left when I was 7.

280
00:19:06,595 --> 00:19:11,705
But my stepfather was an alcoholic.[br]And so was my second stepfather.

281
00:19:12,643 --> 00:19:15,354
Anyway, I have a history[br]of picking the wrong men.

282
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:17,440
Big surprise, right?

283
00:19:17,961 --> 00:19:21,298
The thing is, I never knew I had[br]a drinking problem...

284
00:19:21,506 --> 00:19:25,156
...because ever since high school,[br]I've only dated musicians.

285
00:19:25,468 --> 00:19:27,554
They always said I was a lot of fun.

286
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:31,203
-I like what I hear.[br]-But all that's changed.

287
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,810
I bottomed out.

288
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,877
I was having fun in...

289
00:19:39,962 --> 00:19:42,152
...l don't even remember what city.

290
00:19:42,986 --> 00:19:45,384
When I woke up,[br]I didn't know where I was...

291
00:19:45,697 --> 00:19:48,616
...how I got there,[br]or who the guy was that I was with.

292
00:19:48,825 --> 00:19:52,266
And I thought I should know[br]at least one of those things.

293
00:19:52,474 --> 00:19:53,726
So I came here.

294
00:19:54,038 --> 00:19:58,626
I stopped putting myself in situations[br]where I couldn't respect myself...

295
00:19:58,939 --> 00:20:00,712
...so others didn't respect me.

296
00:20:01,963 --> 00:20:03,631
She wants respect. Cuts me out.

297
00:20:03,944 --> 00:20:05,925
Anyway, I took my first step today.

298
00:20:06,134 --> 00:20:08,011
I bought a new car...

299
00:20:08,636 --> 00:20:13,016
...and it'll be great to get up in the[br]morning and remember where I parked it.

300
00:20:14,058 --> 00:20:15,414
Thanks.

301
00:20:19,376 --> 00:20:21,357
Would anyone else like to share?

302
00:20:27,301 --> 00:20:30,116
It's dead tonight.[br]Not a weeper in the joint.

303
00:20:30,325 --> 00:20:31,367
Weeper?

304
00:20:31,576 --> 00:20:34,704
Usually one or two gals[br]get all weepy after the meeting.

305
00:20:34,913 --> 00:20:39,083
Then you clean up. You go over,[br]offer them a tissue. Bang, you're in.

306
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:41,482
Yank a nose hair right before you go.

307
00:20:41,794 --> 00:20:45,757
They see the tears, think you're[br]a kindred spirit. You are in huge.

308
00:20:45,965 --> 00:20:48,676
Look. Wish me luck.

309
00:20:50,762 --> 00:20:52,117
What happened?

310
00:20:55,871 --> 00:20:58,686
I did so much blow once,[br]I didn't sleep for three weeks.

311
00:20:58,895 --> 00:21:02,648
I lost 1 5 pounds. The good thing?[br]I've been able to keep it off.

312
00:21:03,483 --> 00:21:05,151
Remember me from the aeroplane?

313
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:08,696
Oh, yeah, of course.[br]You hit me really hard.

314
00:21:11,511 --> 00:21:13,284
What are you doing here?

315
00:21:13,597 --> 00:21:16,412
I have a slight problem.[br]You know how it is with airlines.

316
00:21:16,621 --> 00:21:19,332
You're at 30,000 feet[br]with all those tiny bottles.

317
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,626
-It's really not my fault.[br]-Sure.

318
00:21:27,048 --> 00:21:28,716
Damn it!

319
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:35,285
You hit my car. My new car.

320
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,996
-I don't believe it.[br]-What happened?

321
00:21:38,205 --> 00:21:41,646
Don't get excited. First,[br]this isn't new. This is a '98.

322
00:21:41,854 --> 00:21:43,940
-I know a guy with one.[br]-It's new to me!

323
00:21:44,148 --> 00:21:45,921
Oh, God.

324
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:48,006
Look at it.

325
00:21:48,215 --> 00:21:50,717
I guess we both have to drive[br]more carefully.

326
00:21:51,656 --> 00:21:53,220
I was parked, asshole.

327
00:21:53,428 --> 00:21:56,243
I don't see a lot of damage,[br]so I'm gonna run.

328
00:21:56,452 --> 00:21:59,684
Right, I got the cracked taillight,[br]dented fender package.

329
00:22:01,457 --> 00:22:05,211
I want to see your driver's license,[br]registration and insurance.

330
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:09,069
-Can't we settle this without insurance?[br]-No.

331
00:22:10,111 --> 00:22:12,301
If you try to worm your way[br]out of this...

332
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:15,429
...l will cut your heart out[br]with my hood ornament.

333
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:18,557
Have we dated?

334
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:25,335
I'm not very good in bed.

335
00:22:25,543 --> 00:22:27,942
No, no. You're great.

336
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:32,947
No. My boyfriend once said it was[br]like trying to start a dead car.

337
00:22:33,989 --> 00:22:35,970
You've got to uncross your legs.

338
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:39,620
I told you I'm not very good in bed.[br]I'm sorry.

339
00:22:40,037 --> 00:22:41,497
What is that humming sound?

340
00:22:42,331 --> 00:22:44,625
It's the tendons in your legs[br]vibrating.

341
00:22:47,127 --> 00:22:49,317
Oh, you know what?[br]Can you--?

342
00:22:49,526 --> 00:22:51,090
One second.

343
00:22:54,218 --> 00:22:55,260
Hello?

344
00:22:56,616 --> 00:22:59,119
I was just thinking[br]about you too, Steve.

345
00:22:59,327 --> 00:23:01,725
We don't want to lose our momentum.

346
00:23:05,062 --> 00:23:06,939
I miss you too.

347
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,816
Is she there?

348
00:23:12,048 --> 00:23:13,091
Ready for more?

349
00:23:14,655 --> 00:23:15,802
I can't do this.

350
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:19,138
I'm in love with a married pilot[br]from Dallas, our hub.

351
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:23,414
You know who I feel really sorry for?[br]His wife.

352
00:23:23,831 --> 00:23:26,437
-He's off cheating on her.[br]-With you?

353
00:23:28,001 --> 00:23:29,044
Get out!

354
00:23:29,253 --> 00:23:31,234
What'd I do? I'm crazy about you.

355
00:23:31,442 --> 00:23:33,006
-Get out![br]-You smell nice.

356
00:23:33,215 --> 00:23:34,570
I almost opened up to you.

357
00:23:34,779 --> 00:23:37,594
Are those your shoes?[br]Those are beautiful shoes.

358
00:23:48,334 --> 00:23:51,045
You're in a hurry.[br]Aren't you gonna eat?

359
00:23:54,278 --> 00:23:55,737
Gotta get to the office.

360
00:23:55,946 --> 00:23:58,448
-You mean you have to get to her.[br]-What?

361
00:23:59,178 --> 00:24:02,306
-You're having an affair.[br]-What's wrong with you?

362
00:24:02,619 --> 00:24:04,809
All you talk about is[br]how work bores you.

363
00:24:05,017 --> 00:24:08,041
Now you're rushing to get to[br]your job? What's her name?

364
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,292
It's not an affair.

365
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:11,378
It's that Pamela person.

366
00:24:11,586 --> 00:24:14,923
I've seen the way she looks at you.[br]The woman is a slut.

367
00:24:15,132 --> 00:24:16,591
She's in a wheelchair.

368
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,302
Don't think she doesn't play that[br]for all it's worth.

369
00:24:20,554 --> 00:24:24,203
You want to know what's going on?[br]You want to know the truth?

370
00:24:24,412 --> 00:24:25,976
I deserve that much.

371
00:24:27,644 --> 00:24:30,981
This is classified,[br]so it's just between you and me.

372
00:24:31,294 --> 00:24:34,526
A couple days ago, on an Arizona West[br]flight, there was an incident.

373
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:36,403
The crew almost lost control.

374
00:24:36,611 --> 00:24:39,948
One of the passengers was[br]shooting video.

375
00:24:40,157 --> 00:24:43,076
Something made contact[br]with that plane.

376
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,413
The thing is,[br]I don't have an answer for it.

377
00:24:46,621 --> 00:24:50,167
For the first time in 22 years,[br]I don't know what happened.

378
00:24:51,626 --> 00:24:53,503
There's something about that.

379
00:24:54,754 --> 00:24:56,631
About the not knowing.

380
00:24:57,778 --> 00:25:00,802
Look. I'm getting goose bumps[br]just thinking about it.

381
00:25:01,115 --> 00:25:04,034
It's what I've been waiting for.[br]Now it's finally come.

382
00:25:04,243 --> 00:25:06,850
-Understand?[br]-Does she have bigger tits than me?

383
00:25:07,788 --> 00:25:08,935
I'll figure this out.

384
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:11,855
I'll take that as a yes.

385
00:25:13,315 --> 00:25:14,774
I'll be late.

386
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,752
Damn!

387
00:25:45,638 --> 00:25:46,681
Can I help you?

388
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:49,601
I'm looking for Perry.

389
00:25:50,122 --> 00:25:51,165
You know Perry?

390
00:25:51,686 --> 00:25:54,606
Yeah, but not too well. I'm his wife.

391
00:25:55,648 --> 00:25:57,108
His wife?

392
00:25:57,317 --> 00:26:00,445
Well, Perry's a very lucky man,[br]if I may say.

393
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,322
Very lucky.

394
00:26:03,156 --> 00:26:04,199
Harold Anderson.

395
00:26:05,658 --> 00:26:07,744
Helen.[br]He's probably in the vault.

396
00:26:17,858 --> 00:26:20,465
Excuse me.[br]I'm looking for Perry Gordon.

397
00:26:20,673 --> 00:26:23,071
Is it okay if I wait in his office?

398
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,261
-That'll be fine.[br]-Thank you.

399
00:26:26,825 --> 00:26:29,432
Were you at the AA meeting[br]last night?

400
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,873
Yes. I saw you there.[br]Your speech was very good.

401
00:26:33,081 --> 00:26:35,480
Thanks. Do you work here?

402
00:26:35,792 --> 00:26:39,859
Commercial and home loans.[br]Not too exciting. Just a normal guy.

403
00:26:40,068 --> 00:26:42,779
Nothing's wrong with normal.[br]Do you know where Perry is?

404
00:26:42,987 --> 00:26:44,134
You know Perry?

405
00:26:44,343 --> 00:26:46,949
Well, no.[br]He backed into my car last night.

406
00:26:47,158 --> 00:26:49,660
I've got an estimate.[br]Could you give this to him?

407
00:26:49,869 --> 00:26:51,120
Sure.

408
00:26:52,997 --> 00:26:55,708
-You have beautiful handwriting.[br]-That's the mechanic.

409
00:26:57,898 --> 00:27:01,026
This part here where you[br]signed your name? Lovely.

410
00:27:01,964 --> 00:27:03,528
How long you been in the program?

411
00:27:04,467 --> 00:27:05,927
-Program?[br]-AA.

412
00:27:07,074 --> 00:27:10,306
I'm not involved in the program.[br]Perry just took me there.

413
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:11,766
He's in the program?

414
00:27:12,496 --> 00:27:15,937
Not that I know of. This would make[br]fantastic dinner conversation.

415
00:27:16,145 --> 00:27:18,022
-Busy tonight?[br]-Why were you there?

416
00:27:18,231 --> 00:27:21,671
Checking it out. Have you had[br]a chance to think about dinner?

417
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,444
Oh, God. I get it.

418
00:27:23,653 --> 00:27:27,823
You go to AA meetings to[br]pick up women. That's sick.

419
00:27:28,032 --> 00:27:29,909
How can you take advantage of people?

420
00:27:30,326 --> 00:27:32,933
Perry took me. I had no idea.[br]How's 8?

421
00:27:33,141 --> 00:27:34,810
Excuse me. May l?

422
00:27:35,018 --> 00:27:37,208
Here's the estimate, okay?

423
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:42,004
I hope next time you take[br]a pathetic little jaunt to AA...

424
00:27:42,213 --> 00:27:44,090
...you drive more carefully.

425
00:27:44,715 --> 00:27:47,426
-What's she talking about?[br]-I'm as confused as you are.

426
00:27:47,739 --> 00:27:48,886
Oh, come on.

427
00:27:49,095 --> 00:27:51,389
I just put everything I had[br]into this car.

428
00:27:51,597 --> 00:27:56,185
If you don't want to go through your[br]insurance, write a check. I'll wait.

429
00:27:56,393 --> 00:27:58,062
That's where you were last night?

430
00:27:58,687 --> 00:28:02,024
That's what you didn't want to tell me.[br]You were at an AA meeting?

431
00:28:02,233 --> 00:28:04,318
Now you know.[br]I hope you're happy.

432
00:28:04,527 --> 00:28:05,569
You'll get your check.

433
00:28:05,882 --> 00:28:07,029
Why couldn't you tell me?

434
00:28:07,342 --> 00:28:11,408
I wasn't sure I was strong enough to[br]stay committed to the program...

435
00:28:11,617 --> 00:28:14,328
...and I didn't want to disappoint you[br]if I dropped out.

436
00:28:14,641 --> 00:28:16,101
Baby, I had no idea.

437
00:28:16,622 --> 00:28:21,001
It's been tough, but, thank God,[br]so far so good.

438
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:23,921
It's a brave thing you're doing.[br]I can't believe it.

439
00:28:24,129 --> 00:28:26,423
One day at a time, sugar.

440
00:28:26,632 --> 00:28:27,779
I'll walk you out.

441
00:28:27,987 --> 00:28:31,220
I love you so much.[br]I'll do everything in my power...

442
00:28:31,428 --> 00:28:35,808
...to make sure you never take another[br]drink for the rest of your life.

443
00:28:36,225 --> 00:28:37,267
Thank you.

444
00:28:39,979 --> 00:28:41,021
That was his wife.

445
00:28:43,315 --> 00:28:47,069
He's married and he's going to[br]AA meetings to pick up women?

446
00:28:47,277 --> 00:28:49,676
What a humongous sleazebag.[br]You married?

447
00:28:49,884 --> 00:28:52,074
Nope. So I guess we're on for dinner?

448
00:28:53,846 --> 00:28:54,889
No.

449
00:28:55,723 --> 00:28:56,975
Nice meeting you.

450
00:29:06,776 --> 00:29:08,966
What planet are you from?

451
00:29:09,591 --> 00:29:10,634
What do you mean?

452
00:29:10,843 --> 00:29:15,222
You want to go out with me, I say no,[br]you're like, okay, and that's that.

453
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,890
Put a little effort into it.

454
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:18,141
You asking me out?

455
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,938
No, I'm not asking you out. If I was[br]asking a man out, he'd know it.

456
00:29:23,981 --> 00:29:25,023
Right.

457
00:29:26,275 --> 00:29:30,237
You know, I have a feeling[br]that you're not what you appear to be.

458
00:29:30,967 --> 00:29:32,009
You smell nice.

459
00:29:33,678 --> 00:29:37,119
Thanks. Something new.[br]Just bought it today.

460
00:29:37,327 --> 00:29:41,185
God. Why was it never[br]this complicated before?

461
00:29:41,811 --> 00:29:45,043
Because before, by now I'd be drunk[br]and in bed with the guy.

462
00:29:45,252 --> 00:29:46,295
How's 6:00?

463
00:29:47,963 --> 00:29:51,299
Damn it. Fine. Anything. 7.

464
00:29:51,925 --> 00:29:52,968
6:45?

465
00:29:53,176 --> 00:29:54,219
Fine.

466
00:30:10,694 --> 00:30:12,988
Tell me something about yourself.

467
00:30:13,926 --> 00:30:17,159
My name is Harold Anderson.[br]I work in a bank.

468
00:30:17,993 --> 00:30:19,035
And?

469
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:20,704
More?

470
00:30:22,581 --> 00:30:24,979
I never met a man that talks less[br]about himself.

471
00:30:25,187 --> 00:30:26,751
Where were you born?

472
00:30:27,273 --> 00:30:30,088
My turn to ask a question.[br]What do you do for a living?

473
00:30:31,548 --> 00:30:33,529
I worked in a guitar shop[br]for a long time.

474
00:30:33,738 --> 00:30:36,553
When I got sober,[br]I realized I had to get out.

475
00:30:37,387 --> 00:30:39,577
Too many negative influences.

476
00:30:39,785 --> 00:30:40,932
Such as?

477
00:30:41,141 --> 00:30:42,705
Well, musicians, for one.

478
00:30:43,435 --> 00:30:47,397
There was a sign over the door saying:[br]" Come in, pick up a guitar...

479
00:30:47,606 --> 00:30:51,046
...and play the beginning of 'Stairway[br]to Heaven' as badly as you can."

480
00:30:51,255 --> 00:30:53,132
I was close to going postal.

481
00:30:53,653 --> 00:30:55,426
So what are you doing now?

482
00:30:55,634 --> 00:30:59,701
Well, don't laugh, but I'm working[br]as a real-estate agent.

483
00:31:04,289 --> 00:31:07,208
My friend has an office.[br]She helped me study for my license.

484
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:09,711
So now I'm out there[br]trying to sell houses.

485
00:31:10,024 --> 00:31:11,066
How's it going?

486
00:31:12,005 --> 00:31:13,256
I guess it's okay.

487
00:31:13,465 --> 00:31:16,280
But I'm six weeks into it and find out[br]you don't get paid...

488
00:31:16,488 --> 00:31:19,304
...until you sell something,[br]which is like, "Oh, great."

489
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,204
So what is your mission?

490
00:31:25,977 --> 00:31:29,105
-I'm sorry?[br]-Your mission in life.

491
00:31:29,314 --> 00:31:31,503
My mission is to[br]get to know myself...

492
00:31:31,816 --> 00:31:36,717
...so that I can end up focusing less[br]on myself and more on others. I think.

493
00:31:37,343 --> 00:31:40,679
I believe I was put here on Earth[br]to have a child.

494
00:31:44,224 --> 00:31:46,518
I've never heard a man say that.

495
00:31:47,874 --> 00:31:51,106
I would love to have kids.[br]I just hope I'm ready.

496
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:53,922
We transfer our dysfunction[br]onto our kids.

497
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:57,675
I don't want to be guilty of that.[br]I've already fucked up my dog.

498
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:05,391
I want to have a child.[br]That's all I want.

499
00:32:08,624 --> 00:32:09,666
What's that noise?

500
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,273
Cheap sound system.

501
00:32:15,505 --> 00:32:16,652
I don't trust you.

502
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:18,321
Why?

503
00:32:18,738 --> 00:32:19,989
All men are the same.

504
00:32:20,198 --> 00:32:23,013
They say whatever they have to,[br]to get into your pants.

505
00:32:24,368 --> 00:32:27,184
That's terrible.[br]But what would it be?

506
00:32:28,226 --> 00:32:29,269
What?

507
00:32:29,478 --> 00:32:32,084
The thing I'd have to say[br]to get into your pants?

508
00:32:39,592 --> 00:32:41,469
It's a little messy.

509
00:32:42,512 --> 00:32:43,763
How long you been working on it?

510
00:32:44,076 --> 00:32:48,351
Just a couple of months, but I can[br]already tell I'm never gonna stop.

511
00:32:48,976 --> 00:32:53,251
One day I'm happy. The breakfast nook[br]should be yellow, bright and sunny.

512
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,379
Next minute, I'm down.[br]I repaint it blue.

513
00:32:56,588 --> 00:32:58,361
It was black a couple days ago.

514
00:32:58,569 --> 00:33:00,238
A black breakfast nook?

515
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:02,427
Doesn't work. Trust me.

516
00:33:02,636 --> 00:33:05,660
Why don't you take that arch thing[br]out altogether?

517
00:33:05,868 --> 00:33:07,536
The whole thing?

518
00:33:07,745 --> 00:33:11,082
I have a feeling that what's out there[br]is more interesting anyway.

519
00:33:18,589 --> 00:33:19,736
What are these?

520
00:33:24,428 --> 00:33:27,139
Part of this whole changing thing[br]that I'm doing.

521
00:33:27,348 --> 00:33:30,163
I'm supposed to turn myself over[br]to a higher power.

522
00:33:30,372 --> 00:33:33,395
My only problem is,[br]I'm having trouble choosing one...

523
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:35,794
...so I'm just covering my ass.

524
00:33:36,002 --> 00:33:36,941
Higher power?

525
00:33:37,358 --> 00:33:39,339
God, or whatever you want to call it.

526
00:33:39,547 --> 00:33:42,884
I'm looking into each one until[br]I find one that connects with me.

527
00:33:43,093 --> 00:33:44,970
-How will you know?[br]-I'll just know.

528
00:33:46,116 --> 00:33:47,159
How?

529
00:33:48,202 --> 00:33:51,226
Well, I'll feel something, I guess.

530
00:33:51,851 --> 00:33:53,311
This one looks very old.

531
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,065
Actually, it's not old.[br]I got this on QVC.

532
00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:01,340
You don't care about this.[br]You're just tricking me.

533
00:34:01,653 --> 00:34:04,051
There's no way to prove[br]that a God exists.

534
00:34:04,468 --> 00:34:06,971
-So?[br]-So then why look?

535
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:10,516
-That's not the point.[br]-Then what is the point?

536
00:34:10,724 --> 00:34:12,184
Oh, God. I knew it.

537
00:34:12,393 --> 00:34:16,146
I knew this normal guy,[br]normal life thing had a big catch.

538
00:34:16,459 --> 00:34:20,943
Harold, please. Harold.[br]I have to stop.

539
00:34:21,151 --> 00:34:23,654
No, I can't do this.

540
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:31,787
Part of this whole thing[br]about me changing my life...

541
00:34:31,995 --> 00:34:34,915
...and living by a different set[br]of rules is--

542
00:34:35,124 --> 00:34:39,190
You'll laugh, but I decided[br]I won't have sex until I'm married.

543
00:34:40,129 --> 00:34:41,380
Sorry?

544
00:34:41,588 --> 00:34:45,342
You see, I am finally free[br]not to have to have sex.

545
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:49,513
Do you have any water? Never mind.[br]I'll help myself.

546
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:54,935
Thanks for coming.

547
00:34:55,144 --> 00:34:58,480
Have you gotten a woman pregnant yet?

548
00:34:58,689 --> 00:35:01,713
I'm close, but there are variables[br]I'm not prepared for.

549
00:35:01,921 --> 00:35:03,277
You're close?

550
00:35:03,485 --> 00:35:06,613
Yes. But she wants to get married.

551
00:35:07,343 --> 00:35:10,471
3 billion females, and you pick[br]one that wants to get married.

552
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,140
-Yes.[br]-That is bad luck.

553
00:35:12,452 --> 00:35:14,121
-What should I do?[br]-Marry her.

554
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:16,936
I'm not trained for marriage.[br]Perry says it's hell.

555
00:35:17,145 --> 00:35:19,230
-Who's Perry?[br]-This guy at work.

556
00:35:19,439 --> 00:35:21,003
He didn't think Susan was hot.

557
00:35:21,315 --> 00:35:23,609
Who's Susan? Why is she hot?[br]ls she on fire?

558
00:35:23,818 --> 00:35:25,173
Susan is the woman.

559
00:35:26,425 --> 00:35:30,908
Earth probes are at Jupiter. In three[br]generations, they'll know about us.

560
00:35:31,221 --> 00:35:33,098
Our takeover must be complete by then.

561
00:35:33,306 --> 00:35:35,809
Marry her, impregnate her,[br]and don't call me again.

562
00:35:36,018 --> 00:35:38,729
The more we make contact,[br]the greater risk of discovery.

563
00:35:43,421 --> 00:35:45,193
Thanks a lot.

564
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,468
Notice anything unusual[br]about the jolt that hit the plane?

565
00:35:50,094 --> 00:35:53,431
Well, it wasn't like anything[br]I've ever experienced.

566
00:35:53,848 --> 00:35:57,393
Did you see anything fly by the[br]aircraft around the time of the jolt?

567
00:35:57,601 --> 00:36:00,834
No, I was busy trying to keep things[br]calm in the cabin.

568
00:36:01,251 --> 00:36:02,294
A lot of panic?

569
00:36:03,024 --> 00:36:04,171
You can imagine.

570
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,256
Except for one jerk.

571
00:36:06,777 --> 00:36:11,365
He started hitting on me right after.[br]He acted like nothing even happened.

572
00:36:12,408 --> 00:36:14,076
Tell me about the guy that hit on you.

573
00:36:15,015 --> 00:36:17,830
Darn it. I knew I shouldn't[br]have said anything.

574
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:21,688
Okay, I went out with a passenger.[br]I'm guilty.

575
00:36:22,835 --> 00:36:23,878
Excuse me?

576
00:36:24,086 --> 00:36:28,883
We're not supposed to date passengers,[br]but I met him after, at a function.

577
00:36:29,091 --> 00:36:31,177
We went to my place,[br]but nothing happened.

578
00:36:31,698 --> 00:36:34,513
So you first noticed him[br]after the jolt?

579
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:36,911
Yes, he was very obnoxious.

580
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,476
What was he like before the jolt?

581
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:41,187
I don't remember seeing him[br]before the jolt.

582
00:36:41,916 --> 00:36:45,253
Did you notice anything peculiar[br]or unusual about him?

583
00:36:45,462 --> 00:36:47,026
Not really.

584
00:36:47,547 --> 00:36:51,926
Until we got to my place.[br]Then there was something odd.

585
00:36:52,135 --> 00:36:53,178
Go on.

586
00:36:53,386 --> 00:36:57,766
Again, nothing happened,[br]but while we were fooling around...

587
00:36:57,974 --> 00:37:02,771
...there was this strange humming sound[br]coming from his pants.

588
00:37:06,107 --> 00:37:07,567
From the front or the back?

589
00:37:08,505 --> 00:37:09,861
The front.

590
00:37:10,591 --> 00:37:12,051
From the crotch area.

591
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,909
Do you remember his name?

592
00:37:16,638 --> 00:37:18,411
Harold Anderson.

593
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:27,066
There was no Harold Anderson[br]on that flight.

594
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:05,854
Oh, my God.

595
00:38:13,987 --> 00:38:16,594
We have a problem funding your loan.[br]We checked...

596
00:38:16,907 --> 00:38:21,495
...and it turns out there's five frozen[br]yogurt places within a one-mile radius.

597
00:38:21,703 --> 00:38:23,789
-Hey, stranger.[br]-Hey, it's you!

598
00:38:25,144 --> 00:38:27,855
I'm thinking about opening[br]an account here.

599
00:38:28,481 --> 00:38:32,860
Yeah, I don't have a lot of money.[br]I have $7.35.

600
00:38:33,069 --> 00:38:36,718
I'd like to put some of it[br]into a T-bill, some into stocks...

601
00:38:36,927 --> 00:38:39,951
...and the rest I'd just like to save[br]for a rainy day.

602
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:41,932
Would you think about marrying me?

603
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:45,268
All right. I deserved that.

604
00:38:45,685 --> 00:38:48,501
I'm serious. I thought about[br]what you said the other night.

605
00:38:48,709 --> 00:38:51,003
Everything I said was such a turnoff.

606
00:38:51,212 --> 00:38:54,548
I went completely overboard.[br]It was typical Susan.

607
00:38:54,757 --> 00:38:55,800
You know what?

608
00:38:56,217 --> 00:38:58,302
There was some of that.

609
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,160
Susan....[br]What is your last name?

610
00:39:02,682 --> 00:39:03,724
Hart.

611
00:39:04,558 --> 00:39:06,435
Susan Hart...

612
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:10,085
...would you do me the honour[br]of marrying me?

613
00:39:12,691 --> 00:39:13,838
You're serious.

614
00:39:14,047 --> 00:39:15,507
I want to marry you.

615
00:39:15,715 --> 00:39:18,426
I could court you[br]for six months or a year...

616
00:39:18,739 --> 00:39:21,346
...and we could get to know[br]each other, then break up...

617
00:39:21,867 --> 00:39:25,621
...or we could do something[br]that I think we both want now...

618
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,185
...and that's have a child.

619
00:39:29,583 --> 00:39:33,233
Wow! And I just came in[br]to ask you to lunch.

620
00:39:34,901 --> 00:39:37,195
-You really mean this?[br]-Yes.

621
00:39:39,385 --> 00:39:40,427
Can I think about it?

622
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,409
If you think you have to.

623
00:39:51,897 --> 00:39:54,295
This room will be perfect[br]for the baby.

624
00:39:54,504 --> 00:39:56,694
Oh, you have a baby.

625
00:39:56,902 --> 00:39:59,092
We're having one in about six months.

626
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,116
Congratulations. That's wonderful.

627
00:40:03,993 --> 00:40:07,329
I'm sure they'll accept our offer.[br]You'll be very happy here.

628
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:09,206
Thanks. You've been great.

629
00:40:09,415 --> 00:40:10,979
We'll talk to you soon.

630
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:18,173
-What?[br]-Just fuck her right in front of me.

631
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:21,093
You're never getting pregnant again.[br]Never.

632
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:43,824
It's insanity.

633
00:40:44,345 --> 00:40:47,786
Come on. You're off the booze.[br]You're off the musicians...

634
00:40:47,995 --> 00:40:49,976
...and now you want to get married?

635
00:40:50,184 --> 00:40:51,748
And to a man you barely know?

636
00:40:51,957 --> 00:40:53,938
Don't make me put together[br]an intervention.

637
00:40:54,147 --> 00:40:55,294
Thank you.

638
00:40:55,502 --> 00:40:59,777
This is Susan's life.[br]It's not our place to pass judgment.

639
00:40:59,986 --> 00:41:04,469
If she wants to get married and make[br]an idiot of herself, it's her choice.

640
00:41:04,678 --> 00:41:07,389
-Is that the waiter?[br]-No, that's a gay guy without a jacket.

641
00:41:07,597 --> 00:41:09,683
-Why is marriage a bad choice?[br]-Please!

642
00:41:09,891 --> 00:41:11,560
She doesn't even know the man.

643
00:41:11,768 --> 00:41:15,731
There's something to be said for[br]jumping off the end of the diving board.

644
00:41:15,939 --> 00:41:16,982
Life is short.

645
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:19,901
Until you marry the wrong guy.[br]Then it gets pretty long.

646
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,674
I am almost dehydrated.

647
00:41:21,883 --> 00:41:23,655
What do you want to do, Susan?

648
00:41:24,176 --> 00:41:26,053
I'll tell you what she's thinking:

649
00:41:26,262 --> 00:41:28,973
Being single is great.[br]But she goes onto the street...

650
00:41:29,181 --> 00:41:31,788
...or into people's homes[br]and sees babies everywhere.

651
00:41:31,997 --> 00:41:33,144
They're taking over.

652
00:41:33,352 --> 00:41:36,480
I thought that, then I'd look[br]at those little shits...

653
00:41:36,689 --> 00:41:40,443
...and get angry because it looks like[br]they're taunting you, saying:

654
00:41:40,651 --> 00:41:43,675
"Why don't you have one of me yet?[br]Why are you a loser?"

655
00:41:43,884 --> 00:41:46,386
-You don't like my baby?[br]-Your baby's adorable.

656
00:41:46,699 --> 00:41:48,889
When her head gets normal,[br]she'll be gorgeous.

657
00:41:49,097 --> 00:41:51,600
-Her head is normal![br]-I'm kidding!

658
00:41:51,808 --> 00:41:54,936
I want to find out more about this guy.[br]Is he rich?

659
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:56,813
-You can't ask that.[br]-Why not?

660
00:41:57,022 --> 00:41:59,524
Because she doesn't know, okay?

661
00:41:59,733 --> 00:42:02,444
How can you have a child with a man[br]you don't even know?!

662
00:42:02,757 --> 00:42:05,363
Excuse me. You were[br]artificially inseminated.

663
00:42:05,572 --> 00:42:09,743
Yes, I was, but I knew the technician[br]longer than she's known this guy!

664
00:42:09,951 --> 00:42:11,098
I'm out of time.

665
00:42:11,828 --> 00:42:13,079
Do you have to go?

666
00:42:14,226 --> 00:42:15,269
No...

667
00:42:15,999 --> 00:42:17,876
...l'm running out of time.

668
00:42:18,397 --> 00:42:21,421
I think that would be great.[br]I'm looking forward to it.

669
00:42:22,047 --> 00:42:24,341
Hold on. Someone's on the other line.

670
00:42:25,696 --> 00:42:27,781
Hi, Harold. It's me.

671
00:42:28,094 --> 00:42:29,137
Hey, me.

672
00:42:30,805 --> 00:42:32,057
Yes.

673
00:42:32,995 --> 00:42:34,976
The answer is yes.

674
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:36,957
I will marry you.

675
00:42:38,521 --> 00:42:39,564
Hold on a second.

676
00:42:43,526 --> 00:42:47,280
Debbie, I won't be able to go[br]rollerblading this weekend.

677
00:42:47,489 --> 00:42:49,365
I'm getting married. Bye.

678
00:42:51,034 --> 00:42:53,119
I'm back, Mrs. Anderson.

679
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:56,664
I like the sound of that.

680
00:42:56,873 --> 00:42:58,333
Me too.

681
00:42:59,063 --> 00:43:01,461
-You don't mind?[br]-No. Is this everything?

682
00:43:01,669 --> 00:43:05,527
This is all my work. If my clients[br]call, you have their information.

683
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:09,281
-I didn't even know you were doing her.[br]-I'm not.

684
00:43:10,219 --> 00:43:12,513
You're marrying a woman[br]you've never had sex with?

685
00:43:12,826 --> 00:43:14,807
Didn't you see The Crying Game?

686
00:43:15,016 --> 00:43:18,978
You think she's got the goods, lift up[br]her skirt, it's Oscar Mayer time.

687
00:43:19,187 --> 00:43:23,462
-Is this your third-quarter report?[br]-Fisk won't need this till I get back.

688
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,443
-Damn it![br]-What?

689
00:43:25,756 --> 00:43:29,405
Let's go. What am I talking[br]about here? I'm such a downer.

690
00:43:29,614 --> 00:43:33,576
Imagine not banging your wife[br]until you're married. How romantic.

691
00:43:33,889 --> 00:43:35,974
Everything will work out fine.

692
00:43:36,183 --> 00:43:39,207
Not that that's ever happened.[br]I'm kidding. Congratulations.

693
00:43:39,415 --> 00:43:42,543
-Thanks again for doing this.[br]-Go get her, tiger.

694
00:43:58,497 --> 00:44:03,397
I promise to respect you, even if[br]I don't always understand you.

695
00:44:04,961 --> 00:44:08,090
I will honour you[br]and take care of you...

696
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:10,592
...and though it's not[br]politically correct...

697
00:44:10,801 --> 00:44:14,242
...l will obey you as long as[br]your request is reasonable.

698
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:18,204
I will be mother to your children...

699
00:44:18,621 --> 00:44:21,853
...and love you until[br]death do us part.

700
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,460
Very nice.

701
00:44:24,773 --> 00:44:26,754
-Harold.[br]-Present.

702
00:44:26,963 --> 00:44:28,944
No, your vows are next.

703
00:44:29,152 --> 00:44:31,655
This is where they all get nervous.

704
00:44:36,972 --> 00:44:40,205
Susan, I'm so happy[br]we're getting married.

705
00:44:44,167 --> 00:44:47,087
You know what they say.[br]Sometimes less is more.

706
00:44:49,485 --> 00:44:53,656
Harold and Susan, by the powers granted[br]to me by the state of Nevada...

707
00:44:53,864 --> 00:44:57,618
...l now pronounce you[br]husband and wife.

708
00:44:58,348 --> 00:44:59,495
You can kiss the bride.

709
00:46:16,655 --> 00:46:20,930
Stop. I never thought I'd say this,[br]but I can't take any more.

710
00:46:21,139 --> 00:46:22,598
-A few more times.[br]-No.

711
00:46:22,807 --> 00:46:24,371
-Where'd you learn that?[br]-What?

712
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,144
You're amazing.

713
00:46:26,352 --> 00:46:30,627
I've had so many orgasms, some are[br]still stacked up waiting to land.

714
00:46:30,836 --> 00:46:33,234
-Aren't you tired?[br]-Tired of waiting.

715
00:46:33,443 --> 00:46:35,111
Come on. Let's get it on.

716
00:46:35,424 --> 00:46:36,988
Let's talk.

717
00:46:37,926 --> 00:46:39,282
Okay.

718
00:46:42,723 --> 00:46:46,893
I still wish we'd been married[br]in a church with a lot of people.

719
00:46:47,102 --> 00:46:49,500
I always dreamed of[br]a wedding like that.

720
00:46:49,709 --> 00:46:51,064
Me too.

721
00:46:51,794 --> 00:46:53,671
Stop. Stop.

722
00:46:56,695 --> 00:47:00,136
I thought we'd take a helicopter trip[br]over Hoover Dam or something.

723
00:47:00,449 --> 00:47:03,160
-When we could be making love?[br]-I need a break.

724
00:47:03,368 --> 00:47:05,662
We've been screwing[br]for 21 hours nonstop.

725
00:47:05,871 --> 00:47:08,686
-We've had room service.[br]-We did it while I ate.

726
00:47:08,894 --> 00:47:11,293
If I'd known that'd happen,[br]I wouldn't have ordered soup.

727
00:47:11,501 --> 00:47:15,985
I heard this happens after you marry.[br]The woman loses interest in sex.

728
00:47:16,193 --> 00:47:18,383
I love sex with you...

729
00:47:19,426 --> 00:47:23,805
...but I want to do something[br]that involves, I don't know, standing.

730
00:47:24,431 --> 00:47:27,350
Let's do some goofy tourist thing.

731
00:47:27,872 --> 00:47:29,227
Like what?

732
00:47:35,692 --> 00:47:37,777
So back to the room, then?

733
00:47:47,996 --> 00:47:50,186
-Knock-knock.[br]-Perry.

734
00:47:50,707 --> 00:47:54,878
-I am very impressed with this work.[br]-Thank you.

735
00:47:55,086 --> 00:47:58,214
It looks like you've done Anderson's[br]work as well.

736
00:47:58,423 --> 00:48:01,551
This third-quarter report is brilliant.[br]I didn't know you had it in you.

737
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,158
Now you do, and I hope[br]you keep that in mind...

738
00:48:04,366 --> 00:48:07,182
...when you pick a new vice president[br]for this bank.

739
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:09,684
I admit that Harold had[br]the inside track--

740
00:48:09,893 --> 00:48:11,770
I don't know if I trust Anderson.

741
00:48:13,646 --> 00:48:18,651
It's strange, but what kind of guy[br]marries a chick after one date?

742
00:48:18,964 --> 00:48:20,737
I smell some weird cult thing.

743
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:24,491
I have no facts at all[br]to back that up...

744
00:48:24,699 --> 00:48:28,870
...but if they show up dead with[br]40 friends, then we'll know for sure.

745
00:48:29,287 --> 00:48:30,434
I'm sure he's not--

746
00:48:30,643 --> 00:48:34,292
Not to tell tales, but he is lazy,[br]except for when you're around.

747
00:48:34,501 --> 00:48:37,629
The rest of the time[br]he talks about his time in prison.

748
00:48:37,837 --> 00:48:39,714
-Wasn't supposed to say that.[br]-I'm back.

749
00:48:41,382 --> 00:48:43,051
Hey, buddy.[br]How was the honeymoon?

750
00:48:43,259 --> 00:48:45,136
Good. Great.

751
00:48:45,345 --> 00:48:48,368
How was Vegas? Never mind.[br]How many times you bang the wifey?

752
00:48:49,411 --> 00:48:50,662
1 26.

753
00:48:55,459 --> 00:48:56,814
Come on, how many?

754
00:48:57,544 --> 00:48:59,213
1 26. Why?

755
00:49:00,255 --> 00:49:01,194
You serious?

756
00:49:01,819 --> 00:49:03,279
1 26 times in a week?

757
00:49:03,488 --> 00:49:07,137
Harold, there's a Mr. Roland Jones[br]here to see you.

758
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:08,805
Excuse me.

759
00:49:10,682 --> 00:49:12,872
I thought you said he was lazy.

760
00:49:23,716 --> 00:49:26,531
-Hi. Harold Anderson.[br]-Roland Jones.

761
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:27,678
-Have a seat.[br]-Thank you.

762
00:49:27,887 --> 00:49:31,536
I won't take up much time. I'm with[br]the Federal Aviation Authority.

763
00:49:31,745 --> 00:49:34,352
Don't tell me[br]the government needs a loan.

764
00:49:34,873 --> 00:49:36,541
That's another story.

765
00:49:37,063 --> 00:49:38,731
Maybe you can help me out here.

766
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:43,110
You were on an Arizona West flight from[br]Seattle a few weeks ago, weren't you?

767
00:49:43,319 --> 00:49:46,447
I'd have to check my day planner.[br]I do a lot of flying.

768
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:51,035
Let me remind you of the flight.[br]The plane experienced severe turbulence.

769
00:49:51,244 --> 00:49:53,225
It frightened a lot of the passengers.

770
00:49:53,537 --> 00:49:57,291
I don't remember it being scary.[br]I remember a small bump and then--

771
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:00,315
Was there something[br]mechanically wrong with the plane?

772
00:50:00,524 --> 00:50:02,296
Do you still have your ticket?

773
00:50:02,609 --> 00:50:04,799
I wish I did.[br]I throw all that stuff out.

774
00:50:05,112 --> 00:50:07,718
-You don't save it for the records?[br]-Don't keep records.

775
00:50:07,927 --> 00:50:09,178
Don't tell my boss.

776
00:50:09,387 --> 00:50:13,245
I could win a Pulitzer in fiction[br]for some of my expense reports.

777
00:50:16,686 --> 00:50:18,562
I won't waste any more of your time.

778
00:50:20,126 --> 00:50:21,691
A little light reading.

779
00:50:22,003 --> 00:50:24,297
Have you seen[br]this month's issue of Playboy?

780
00:50:26,278 --> 00:50:28,364
Check out this month's Playmate.

781
00:50:28,989 --> 00:50:31,388
Tell me if you think[br]those babies are real.

782
00:50:47,445 --> 00:50:49,114
I think those are real.

783
00:50:49,844 --> 00:50:51,095
Me too.

784
00:50:52,242 --> 00:50:53,597
I'll be in touch.

785
00:50:57,768 --> 00:50:59,124
God!

786
00:51:02,147 --> 00:51:03,399
Where are the pictures?

787
00:51:04,233 --> 00:51:05,693
-Pictures?[br]-Of the honeymoon.

788
00:51:05,901 --> 00:51:09,446
As a friend, you're obligated[br]to bore me with your pictures.

789
00:51:09,655 --> 00:51:10,593
I don't have any.

790
00:51:10,906 --> 00:51:12,574
You didn't take pictures?

791
00:51:12,783 --> 00:51:16,745
I took some, but I wanted to fill[br]the roll before I had it processed.

792
00:51:16,954 --> 00:51:19,873
You took less than[br]one roll of pictures?

793
00:51:20,186 --> 00:51:21,542
What is that?

794
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:24,670
I guess she was kept busy[br]doing other things.

795
00:51:25,295 --> 00:51:26,860
You could say that.

796
00:51:30,092 --> 00:51:31,656
It was pretty great.

797
00:51:31,865 --> 00:51:33,429
I'll bet, I'll bet.

798
00:51:34,784 --> 00:51:36,035
There's just one thing.

799
00:51:36,348 --> 00:51:38,642
Yes, there's always "one thing."

800
00:51:38,851 --> 00:51:42,813
I don't know how serious this is[br]or if I should be worried, but....

801
00:51:43,856 --> 00:51:45,107
What?

802
00:51:46,254 --> 00:51:48,026
How should I put this?

803
00:51:49,382 --> 00:51:51,884
When he's aroused, his penis vibrates.

804
00:51:54,283 --> 00:51:56,577
Hey, "two-two-two mints in one."

805
00:51:56,785 --> 00:51:59,288
Wait. What do you mean, it vibrates?

806
00:51:59,496 --> 00:52:02,520
"Vibrates" is not really the word.[br]It's more like....

807
00:52:02,833 --> 00:52:05,544
-There's a humming sound.[br]-Humming.

808
00:52:05,961 --> 00:52:09,402
I was with a black guy whose penis[br]whistled when he got excited.

809
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:11,696
-Stop![br]-Yes! I'm not kidding!

810
00:52:11,904 --> 00:52:13,051
What did it whistle?

811
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:16,179
The score from Guys and Dolls.[br]It just whistled.

812
00:52:16,388 --> 00:52:19,516
-You would ask that.[br]-I thought I was making tea.

813
00:52:19,725 --> 00:52:21,080
I love it. I love it.

814
00:52:22,853 --> 00:52:25,042
Hi, honey! You're home.

815
00:52:25,251 --> 00:52:26,815
You remember the girls.

816
00:52:27,024 --> 00:52:28,483
Yes. Hello.

817
00:52:36,929 --> 00:52:38,598
Showtime.

818
00:52:43,811 --> 00:52:45,584
I guess you don't like my friends.

819
00:52:46,418 --> 00:52:47,669
Why do you say that?

820
00:52:48,399 --> 00:52:51,736
You barely acknowledged them.[br]What's the problem?

821
00:52:52,048 --> 00:52:53,717
I don't know. They're your friends.

822
00:52:56,219 --> 00:52:57,471
What's wrong?

823
00:52:58,722 --> 00:53:00,182
Nothing.

824
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:02,893
I had a bad day at work.

825
00:53:03,101 --> 00:53:04,561
You want to talk about it?

826
00:53:04,769 --> 00:53:06,125
No.

827
00:53:06,855 --> 00:53:08,732
Have you taken the pregnancy test?

828
00:53:09,045 --> 00:53:13,841
No, but I will in a few days. You're[br]not looking at me when I talk to you.

829
00:53:16,343 --> 00:53:19,263
You're looking at me,[br]but you're not really looking.

830
00:53:19,576 --> 00:53:21,974
I'm looking right at you[br]and listening, I swear.

831
00:53:22,704 --> 00:53:24,268
Oh, I'm sorry.

832
00:53:24,581 --> 00:53:27,292
It's probably not you.[br]It's probably me.

833
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,899
Can we just try[br]to have a conversation?

834
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:31,984
Oh, Christ!

835
00:53:32,297 --> 00:53:34,382
Turn that thing off.

836
00:53:59,616 --> 00:54:00,971
You should pee on it again.

837
00:54:01,388 --> 00:54:04,621
-You pee on it. I'm done.[br]-I just want to know for sure.

838
00:54:04,829 --> 00:54:08,166
I feel like I'd be worth nothing[br]to you if I couldn't conceive.

839
00:54:08,374 --> 00:54:11,085
What if I can't have a baby?[br]Did you think about that?

840
00:54:11,294 --> 00:54:15,778
I led a pretty wild life. All that sex[br]and drinking. Maybe I can't conceive.

841
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:18,176
-How much sex and drinking?[br]-That's not the point.

842
00:54:18,384 --> 00:54:20,887
You brought it up.[br]How would we know for sure?

843
00:54:21,095 --> 00:54:23,598
I don't know.[br]I'd have to have an exam.

844
00:54:23,806 --> 00:54:26,205
Then let's call[br]and schedule something.

845
00:54:26,935 --> 00:54:28,603
I have to talk to you.

846
00:54:36,423 --> 00:54:37,987
-What?[br]-Nothing.

847
00:54:38,196 --> 00:54:39,864
You said you wanted to talk.

848
00:54:40,385 --> 00:54:42,054
I changed my mind.

849
00:54:44,452 --> 00:54:46,016
What are you thinking?

850
00:54:46,225 --> 00:54:47,580
-Who?[br]-You.

851
00:54:47,997 --> 00:54:49,665
What are you thinking right now?

852
00:54:51,125 --> 00:54:52,898
I don't remember.

853
00:54:54,775 --> 00:54:59,050
It's not like the world will stop[br]spinning if I can't have a child.

854
00:54:59,258 --> 00:55:01,865
There's such a thing as adoption.

855
00:55:02,282 --> 00:55:04,368
That's a viable alternative.

856
00:55:05,098 --> 00:55:06,453
What are you thinking now?

857
00:55:08,747 --> 00:55:11,354
That you're telling me[br]you can't have a baby.

858
00:55:11,562 --> 00:55:13,022
Is that all you're thinking?

859
00:55:13,439 --> 00:55:15,003
Let me think.

860
00:55:15,733 --> 00:55:16,984
Yeah.

861
00:55:18,444 --> 00:55:20,008
I want to have a child.

862
00:55:20,217 --> 00:55:23,345
I'm as into having a child as you are.

863
00:55:23,658 --> 00:55:27,203
I'm getting this vibe from you,[br]this vibe that says...

864
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:32,104
...l'm holding out on you,[br]or I don't want it as much as you do.

865
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:35,753
Whether I can have a child[br]or if I can't...

866
00:55:35,962 --> 00:55:38,568
...there has to be more[br]to this relationship.

867
00:55:38,777 --> 00:55:40,967
Like maybe some communication.

868
00:55:41,279 --> 00:55:45,033
And a little feeling,[br]which is not what I'm getting.

869
00:55:47,327 --> 00:55:51,602
I suggest you start opening up[br]and stop pressuring me about the baby.

870
00:55:51,811 --> 00:55:55,773
Because at this point, I'm ready to buy[br]a baby and shove it up your ass.

871
00:56:03,072 --> 00:56:05,053
This might be a good time...

872
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:09,015
...to sit next to me[br]and try to comfort me.

873
00:56:19,234 --> 00:56:22,466
You might want to consider[br]putting your arm around me.

874
00:56:32,059 --> 00:56:35,083
Maybe you should try[br]to put some feeling into it.

875
00:56:39,045 --> 00:56:41,652
Not that kind of feeling!

876
00:56:42,382 --> 00:56:43,946
Jesus, Harold!

877
00:56:44,154 --> 00:56:46,657
At times like this,[br]I feel like I don't know you.

878
00:56:46,865 --> 00:56:49,785
You don't. Maybe that's why[br]you're having that feeling.

879
00:56:49,994 --> 00:56:51,245
What?

880
00:56:51,453 --> 00:56:54,477
You don't really know me. You don't.

881
00:56:56,041 --> 00:56:57,292
I don't know what to say.

882
00:56:57,501 --> 00:57:00,525
Why don't you try talking to me[br]like a human being?

883
00:57:08,554 --> 00:57:12,307
I have to take a little walk.[br]I'll be right back.

884
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:15,957
Why are you drinking?

885
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:19,398
When we met, she liked that[br]I didn't talk about myself.

886
00:57:19,606 --> 00:57:22,109
Now she wants to know[br]everything I'm thinking!

887
00:57:22,317 --> 00:57:25,028
-Who?[br]-Susan! It's a living hell!

888
00:57:25,237 --> 00:57:27,844
Perry at work turned in[br]my third-quarter report...

889
00:57:28,052 --> 00:57:31,180
...and claimed the work was his.[br]What if he gets that promotion?

890
00:57:31,389 --> 00:57:34,100
I'm this close to taking off[br]the penis and coming home!

891
00:57:34,309 --> 00:57:37,332
You will not. Your penis[br]is staying right where it is.

892
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:40,148
-How's it working?[br]-It's a major pain in the ass.

893
00:57:40,773 --> 00:57:43,171
-They installed it too far back?[br]-No, it hums.

894
00:57:44,214 --> 00:57:47,134
We'll work on it.[br]You're here to make adjustments.

895
00:57:47,342 --> 00:57:49,741
She thinks she might not[br]be able to have a baby.

896
00:57:49,949 --> 00:57:51,826
What will I do if she can't?

897
00:57:52,034 --> 00:57:54,328
I've got 4 million men[br]waiting for you to succeed.

898
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:57,561
If this woman can't have a baby,[br]find one who can.

899
00:57:57,769 --> 00:57:59,438
All right, I'll cheat on my wife.

900
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:04,755
I don't know what that means.[br]I want you to complete your mission.

901
00:58:06,841 --> 00:58:09,552
Fine. I'll get someone else pregnant.

902
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,012
Stop drinking.

903
00:58:11,637 --> 00:58:13,410
And I'll get on your penis right away.

904
00:58:13,827 --> 00:58:15,912
Could you say that a little louder?

905
00:58:17,268 --> 00:58:20,813
Just put it in triplicate,[br]give it to-- Wait, hang on.

906
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:23,524
Hang on! Hello?

907
00:58:23,941 --> 00:58:26,965
Randy, just talk. I can hear you.

908
00:58:28,008 --> 00:58:30,302
Arizona West 771 ?

909
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:32,491
The same kind of jolt?

910
00:58:32,804 --> 00:58:34,994
How many jolts were there?

911
00:58:36,141 --> 00:58:39,895
Listen to me![br]Do you have a passenger list there?

912
00:58:40,937 --> 00:58:43,648
Is there a Harold Anderson onboard?

913
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:45,838
There is?

914
00:58:47,089 --> 00:58:48,862
What a coincidence.

915
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:53,137
I'm an alien from another planet.

916
00:58:54,805 --> 00:58:55,952
Really?

917
00:58:56,161 --> 00:58:59,497
Yeah. Somewhere[br]way the hell out there.

918
00:59:00,123 --> 00:59:05,128
How come you don't have a head[br]like a pear with the big eyes?

919
00:59:07,213 --> 00:59:11,280
You know, there's a lot of aliens.[br]We're not the only ones.

920
00:59:11,593 --> 00:59:15,242
Those big-head guys scare me.[br]I wouldn't want to bump into one.

921
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:19,413
I hear they perform anal probes.[br]How primitive is that technology?

922
00:59:19,726 --> 00:59:22,124
"We came 6 trillion miles[br]to study your ass.

923
00:59:22,333 --> 00:59:25,252
We're proctologists from space."

924
00:59:26,191 --> 00:59:28,276
Could I have another one here?

925
00:59:29,527 --> 00:59:31,300
What's it all about?

926
00:59:35,679 --> 00:59:37,869
Yeah, go ahead and rest.

927
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:46,106
Hey, Helen.

928
00:59:53,927 --> 00:59:55,699
-Harold.[br]-Hey!

929
00:59:55,908 --> 00:59:57,055
Helen, right?

930
00:59:57,263 --> 00:59:59,140
Yeah. Who's your friend?

931
00:59:59,349 --> 01:00:03,728
My personal shopper. Unfortunately,[br]she only knows how to buy booze.

932
01:00:05,918 --> 01:00:09,463
I think I'll bum one of her[br]cigarettes. Think she'll miss it?

933
01:00:10,714 --> 01:00:13,112
I don't think she'd miss a limb.

934
01:00:14,155 --> 01:00:15,406
Light me.

935
01:00:23,018 --> 01:00:24,269
Thanks.

936
01:00:24,895 --> 01:00:26,459
So how's work?

937
01:00:27,606 --> 01:00:29,379
Bank stuff. Nothing exciting.

938
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:33,132
Nothing exciting?[br]I wouldn't say that.

939
01:00:33,341 --> 01:00:36,990
I've loved numbers and math[br]ever since I was a little girl.

940
01:00:37,512 --> 01:00:39,389
I find it fascinating.

941
01:00:39,806 --> 01:00:42,204
You get to deal with[br]all that money all day.

942
01:00:42,412 --> 01:00:44,811
Just thinking about it makes me hot.

943
01:00:54,299 --> 01:00:56,176
You're making a noise.

944
01:00:56,906 --> 01:00:58,470
That's my penis.

945
01:00:59,721 --> 01:01:01,077
It hums.

946
01:01:01,911 --> 01:01:03,996
Guess it doesn't know the words.

947
01:01:04,622 --> 01:01:06,603
I could teach it a few.

948
01:01:27,561 --> 01:01:30,168
-What's the matter?[br]-Nothing.

949
01:01:58,738 --> 01:01:59,885
Damn it!

950
01:02:00,824 --> 01:02:02,701
Goddamn it, come on!

951
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,203
Damn it!

952
01:02:18,862 --> 01:02:20,635
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

953
01:02:20,948 --> 01:02:23,659
I can do whatever you need.[br]What do you need?

954
01:02:24,806 --> 01:02:25,953
I need to go home.

955
01:02:26,579 --> 01:02:27,934
To your wife?

956
01:02:28,664 --> 01:02:30,749
Don't tell me you feel guilty.

957
01:02:30,958 --> 01:02:32,313
Guilty?

958
01:03:00,571 --> 01:03:03,490
Just when you're found[br]With your chin on the ground

959
01:03:03,699 --> 01:03:05,993
There's a lot to be learned

960
01:03:06,201 --> 01:03:09,642
So look around

961
01:03:11,102 --> 01:03:14,543
Just what makes that little old ant

962
01:03:14,751 --> 01:03:17,671
Think he'll move that rubber tree plant

963
01:03:18,505 --> 01:03:20,695
Anyone knows an ant

964
01:03:20,903 --> 01:03:24,032
Can't move a rubber tree plant

965
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:27,472
But he's got high hopes

966
01:03:28,202 --> 01:03:31,330
He's got high hopes

967
01:03:31,539 --> 01:03:34,876
He's got high apple pie

968
01:03:35,084 --> 01:03:37,795
In the sky hopes

969
01:03:39,046 --> 01:03:41,340
Congratulations, Dad! We're pregnant!

970
01:03:44,364 --> 01:03:46,450
I don't believe it. I did it!

971
01:03:46,867 --> 01:03:48,327
I helped.

972
01:03:48,535 --> 01:03:50,620
Now you can't leave me.

973
01:03:55,313 --> 01:03:57,085
-Morning, Melanie.[br]-Morning.

974
01:03:57,294 --> 01:03:59,066
-Jessie, how are the kids?[br]-Great.

975
01:03:59,275 --> 01:04:03,759
Dave, I can tell from the look[br]on your face you got some last night.

976
01:04:03,967 --> 01:04:05,218
Good man.

977
01:04:19,816 --> 01:04:22,944
Morning, Harold. I heard[br]the good news. Congratulations.

978
01:04:23,153 --> 01:04:24,300
Thank you.

979
01:04:24,508 --> 01:04:28,992
I've thought about that promotion.[br]I hope you haven't made up your mind.

980
01:04:29,201 --> 01:04:33,476
It's between you and Perry. His[br]third-quarter report was a knockout.

981
01:04:33,684 --> 01:04:36,187
-You seen Perry?[br]-He's in the vault.

982
01:04:36,499 --> 01:04:38,481
-Thank you.[br]-You're welcome.

983
01:04:42,756 --> 01:04:46,092
So you see the balance of power[br]changing in the Middle East.

984
01:04:46,301 --> 01:04:51,097
It has to, because a high percentage[br]of lsraelis practice birth control...

985
01:04:51,306 --> 01:04:54,434
... whereas a high percentage[br]of people in Arab nations do not.

986
01:04:54,643 --> 01:04:58,188
I've heard this theory, but it[br]sounds a bit crazy, even paranoid.

987
01:04:58,396 --> 01:05:00,899
Your interpretation of it[br]might be paranoid...

988
01:05:01,107 --> 01:05:03,923
...but the fact is,[br]Arabs are having more children.

989
01:05:04,131 --> 01:05:05,904
In a couple of generations...

990
01:05:06,112 --> 01:05:09,449
... they'll be able to control the[br]voting in lsrael, hence, take over.

991
01:05:09,657 --> 01:05:12,264
So they're getting control[br]from within?

992
01:05:12,473 --> 01:05:14,454
That's the idea.

993
01:05:19,772 --> 01:05:22,483
I think I got it.[br]I think I know why he's here.

994
01:05:23,213 --> 01:05:24,464
What are you doing?

995
01:05:24,672 --> 01:05:26,966
-I'm leaving.[br]-You're leaving?

996
01:05:27,279 --> 01:05:30,929
I found this in your bottom drawer[br]under your winter pants.

997
01:05:31,554 --> 01:05:33,014
That's not for your eyes.

998
01:05:33,223 --> 01:05:36,663
Why do you have a picture of[br]a naked man touching himself...

999
01:05:36,976 --> 01:05:38,645
...in your winter pants drawer?

1000
01:05:38,853 --> 01:05:40,730
It's not a man. That's the alien.

1001
01:05:41,251 --> 01:05:42,711
Oh, the alien.

1002
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:44,171
The alienlbanker.

1003
01:05:44,484 --> 01:05:47,299
I don't know what I'll do[br]if you tell me you're gay.

1004
01:05:47,716 --> 01:05:51,991
I'm not gay. I'm tracking an alien.[br]He's here to have sex with our women.

1005
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,972
His penis hums.

1006
01:05:54,181 --> 01:05:57,518
It sounds like that heater[br]in our timeshare at Deer Valley.

1007
01:05:57,726 --> 01:06:01,063
I'm not making this up![br]I'll prove everything!

1008
01:06:01,271 --> 01:06:03,774
Oh, my God. You've done it again!

1009
01:06:05,025 --> 01:06:08,257
It's always like this.[br]You get obsessed with things.

1010
01:06:08,883 --> 01:06:11,073
Anything to avoid intimacy!

1011
01:06:11,281 --> 01:06:14,826
You lost your first wife to golf,[br]your second because of other women!

1012
01:06:15,035 --> 01:06:15,973
You were one of them.

1013
01:06:16,182 --> 01:06:18,684
Golf I can understand.[br]Women I can understand.

1014
01:06:18,893 --> 01:06:21,291
But this?[br]Aliens having sex with people?

1015
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:24,107
How does that make me feel?

1016
01:06:24,315 --> 01:06:29,112
Tell me you're having an affair with a[br]beautiful stripper instead of a man...

1017
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,823
...so I can at least[br]look at myself in the mirror!

1018
01:06:32,031 --> 01:06:34,325
Baby, I swear I'm not.

1019
01:06:40,581 --> 01:06:43,084
This is not what I want my life to be.

1020
01:06:45,482 --> 01:06:47,672
I think Helen's having an affair.

1021
01:06:50,174 --> 01:06:51,321
What makes you think that?

1022
01:06:51,530 --> 01:06:54,345
I found a belt in my bedroom[br]that wasn't mine.

1023
01:06:54,553 --> 01:06:57,682
-Sure it's not yours?[br]-Positive. It was Armani.

1024
01:06:57,890 --> 01:07:01,331
Only queers wear Armani.[br]I think he did her in the shower.

1025
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:04,251
-The curtain was ripped.[br]-Maybe she slipped.

1026
01:07:04,668 --> 01:07:06,962
Fisk walked into the vault yesterday.

1027
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:10,298
Two seconds earlier,[br]he would've caught me and Rita.

1028
01:07:12,905 --> 01:07:15,512
Did you tell Fisk I was in the vault?

1029
01:07:16,242 --> 01:07:18,849
-You fucking my wife?[br]-No. And no!

1030
01:07:19,057 --> 01:07:19,995
You sure?

1031
01:07:20,204 --> 01:07:24,479
Why would I do that? To get even[br]with you for giving Fisk my report?

1032
01:07:25,626 --> 01:07:27,294
Where does that come from?

1033
01:07:27,503 --> 01:07:29,484
What did I do to deserve that...

1034
01:07:29,693 --> 01:07:32,716
...other than extend[br]the hand of friendship?

1035
01:07:32,925 --> 01:07:36,679
-After everything I've done for you?[br]-What have you done for me?

1036
01:07:37,304 --> 01:07:40,224
What have I done?[br]What have I done for you?

1037
01:07:40,432 --> 01:07:43,978
Did I not take you to the place[br]where you met your wife?

1038
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:46,689
-Sorry.[br]-It's okay.

1039
01:07:47,106 --> 01:07:48,357
Sorry.

1040
01:07:48,878 --> 01:07:52,945
Jeez, just try to relax![br]You are wound as tight as a drum!

1041
01:07:53,153 --> 01:07:55,552
Do us both a favour, okay?

1042
01:07:57,220 --> 01:08:00,765
I'll be in the vault.[br]If you see Fisk, cover for me.

1043
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:03,581
Asshole.

1044
01:08:03,789 --> 01:08:05,457
Not you, sir.

1045
01:08:07,647 --> 01:08:09,628
They try the reverse to Specca.

1046
01:08:09,837 --> 01:08:11,401
Has some running room.

1047
01:08:11,609 --> 01:08:13,903
Cuts it back inside,[br]but the pursuit will catch up.

1048
01:08:14,112 --> 01:08:17,970
That's Tim Schaefer, the cornerback,[br]chasing him out of bounds.

1049
01:08:30,482 --> 01:08:31,734
Hi.

1050
01:08:33,402 --> 01:08:34,653
Hi, Dad.

1051
01:08:34,862 --> 01:08:36,113
Hi.

1052
01:08:36,739 --> 01:08:39,971
-You want to go fool around?[br]-Fourth quarter.

1053
01:08:40,179 --> 01:08:41,848
Is there something wrong?

1054
01:08:42,056 --> 01:08:43,099
No.

1055
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:44,872
Why?

1056
01:08:45,184 --> 01:08:47,478
I hope I'm not going to say this.

1057
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:49,147
I am.

1058
01:08:49,877 --> 01:08:54,256
You're more distant since I got[br]pregnant. Or is it my hormones?

1059
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:56,863
-I think it's your hormones.[br]-I don't think so.

1060
01:08:57,071 --> 01:09:01,242
-What are you talking about?[br]-You haven't touched me in weeks.

1061
01:09:01,451 --> 01:09:04,057
-Turning that off?[br]-I'm turning the sound up.

1062
01:09:04,266 --> 01:09:06,038
Let me.

1063
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:11,252
Maybe I haven't touched you as much...

1064
01:09:11,461 --> 01:09:14,797
...but that's no reason[br]to destroy the remote. Come on.

1065
01:09:23,035 --> 01:09:24,286
Where are you going?

1066
01:09:25,537 --> 01:09:28,561
To buy a new remote,[br]or we'll have to keep getting up.

1067
01:09:28,769 --> 01:09:32,106
Excuse me. We have plans.[br]Or have you forgotten?

1068
01:09:32,315 --> 01:09:34,087
-We have plans?[br]-Yes.

1069
01:09:34,296 --> 01:09:37,007
I was thinking about[br]looking at cribs for the baby.

1070
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:40,135
-You didn't tell me that.[br]-I'm telling you now.

1071
01:09:40,343 --> 01:09:44,514
Don't let me hold you up.[br]Go get your precious remote.

1072
01:09:44,723 --> 01:09:46,287
We won't worry about the crib.

1073
01:09:46,495 --> 01:09:50,771
The baby can sleep in a drawer for[br]the first year of its life. Just go.

1074
01:09:53,377 --> 01:09:55,984
-What are you doing?[br]-You said go.

1075
01:09:56,193 --> 01:09:57,444
Bye.

1076
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:02,762
It's a universal remote.

1077
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:05,264
It comes with codes[br]for every TV and VCR.

1078
01:10:05,473 --> 01:10:08,914
You punch in the code for your[br]equipment and you're in business.

1079
01:10:09,226 --> 01:10:12,250
-Yes. Modern technology.[br]-You said it.

1080
01:10:12,459 --> 01:10:14,753
-What do you think of "Aaron"?[br]-Who's Aaron?

1081
01:10:15,483 --> 01:10:17,777
No, for the baby if it's a boy.

1082
01:10:19,758 --> 01:10:22,364
You said you were six weeks pregnant?

1083
01:10:24,346 --> 01:10:25,701
Something wrong?

1084
01:10:30,602 --> 01:10:31,749
Who are you calling?

1085
01:10:33,209 --> 01:10:35,190
Tom, could you come in here?

1086
01:10:36,858 --> 01:10:40,612
I'm sure it's nothing to be[br]alarmed about. Have you had pain...

1087
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:43,636
...or any other[br]out-of-the-ordinary symptoms?

1088
01:10:43,844 --> 01:10:47,181
No, not a single problem.[br]Not even morning sickness.

1089
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:52,082
Look at this.

1090
01:10:55,627 --> 01:10:58,442
Looks like a perfectly formed[br]5-month-old fetus.

1091
01:10:58,651 --> 01:11:01,049
She's at six weeks.

1092
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,220
I'm scared.

1093
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:08,035
He said it was healthy.[br]That's the important thing.

1094
01:11:08,243 --> 01:11:10,954
-Did you see rosemary's Baby?[br]-Rosemary who?

1095
01:11:11,163 --> 01:11:14,708
-No, it's--[br]-You need to rest. Just sit down.

1096
01:11:14,917 --> 01:11:17,315
-Thanks.[br]-No problem.

1097
01:11:17,941 --> 01:11:19,192
Easy. Easy.

1098
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:21,486
-Thanks.[br]-There you go.

1099
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:25,865
Don't.

1100
01:11:31,079 --> 01:11:32,434
Thank you all so much.

1101
01:11:32,643 --> 01:11:34,311
-Congratulations.[br]-Thank you, Hank.

1102
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:36,292
Hey, Anderson!

1103
01:11:36,814 --> 01:11:38,482
You're late. It's 1 1 :00.

1104
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:42,548
I'll let it slide, as it's[br]my first day as vice president.

1105
01:11:43,695 --> 01:11:46,928
-You got the promotion?[br]-And you didn't.

1106
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:49,952
There's always five years from now.[br]Champagne?

1107
01:11:53,288 --> 01:11:55,895
Harold, don't take it so hard.

1108
01:12:06,948 --> 01:12:09,242
-Do I smell tears?[br]-What is your fucking problem?

1109
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:11,640
You stole my report.

1110
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:15,289
You have sex with a coworker[br]during office hours.

1111
01:12:15,498 --> 01:12:19,043
You got the promotion,[br]which means you're blowing the boss.

1112
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:23,631
I've met some pathetic humans[br]in my life, but you take the cake!

1113
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:27,593
Like you're better. I knew it was you[br]who sent Fisk to the vault.

1114
01:12:27,802 --> 01:12:30,200
The Armani belt was yours, you prick!

1115
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:34,267
You wouldn't bang other people's wives[br]if your old lady wasn't a drunk!

1116
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:42,817
You're crazy!

1117
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:44,589
I don't remember hitting him.

1118
01:12:44,798 --> 01:12:47,613
He was talking, and I was feeling[br]l-don't-know-what...

1119
01:12:47,822 --> 01:12:51,158
...because he got the promotion[br]and he stole my work.

1120
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:55,746
He'll make more money than me,[br]and we have a baby on the way.

1121
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:58,874
I hit him.[br]I don't know who I am anymore.

1122
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:03,149
You're being too hard on yourself.[br]You're just human, that's all.

1123
01:13:03,358 --> 01:13:04,714
Shit, I'm bleeding.

1124
01:13:05,339 --> 01:13:08,154
No, you're not. You're crying.

1125
01:13:26,506 --> 01:13:29,947
-I love the way you look at the stars.[br]-I was just looking.

1126
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:32,241
No, there's something different.

1127
01:13:32,449 --> 01:13:35,369
When most people look,[br]they look all over.

1128
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:39,540
You're always focused, like you[br]look at the same one every time.

1129
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:43,398
I feel so much better[br]when I'm with you.

1130
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:47,464
That's the nicest thing[br]you've ever said to me.

1131
01:13:47,777 --> 01:13:51,010
I didn't say it to be nice.[br]It's just a fact.

1132
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:53,408
That's even nicer, I guess.

1133
01:13:55,806 --> 01:13:58,621
I'm sorry about that whole thing[br]with the remote.

1134
01:13:58,830 --> 01:13:59,977
That's okay.

1135
01:14:15,096 --> 01:14:17,181
Are you gonna make love to me?

1136
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:18,746
I believe so.

1137
01:14:19,684 --> 01:14:20,831
I'm pregnant.

1138
01:14:21,561 --> 01:14:22,812
I know.

1139
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:46,690
-I don't know what the problem is.[br]-You have a problem listening to me.

1140
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:49,818
-Stop being so stubborn.[br]-I'm not stubborn.

1141
01:14:58,890 --> 01:15:01,079
-Why are you here?[br]-Let's buy this house.

1142
01:15:01,288 --> 01:15:02,956
-What?[br]-Why not?

1143
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:05,980
It's a beautiful house.[br]It's perfect for the baby.

1144
01:15:06,189 --> 01:15:09,629
-You can't be serious.[br]-I am. I'm dead serious.

1145
01:15:11,611 --> 01:15:13,175
We won't need this anymore.

1146
01:15:13,383 --> 01:15:16,094
-I don't believe this![br]-Let's take a look.

1147
01:15:17,658 --> 01:15:19,535
This is going to be so great.

1148
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:21,099
Look, our cactus.

1149
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:24,644
-I couldn't even imagine this![br]-I don't either.

1150
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:26,938
Universal domination.

1151
01:15:27,147 --> 01:15:30,171
Taking over from the inside[br]through deception and fraud.

1152
01:15:30,379 --> 01:15:33,195
I believe in what[br]I'm saying 1 1 0 percent.

1153
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:38,408
So this person is here to have sex.

1154
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:39,555
Correct.

1155
01:15:39,764 --> 01:15:41,745
Did they run out of pussy[br]on his planet?

1156
01:15:42,996 --> 01:15:46,854
It sounds insane, but I have[br]passenger lists of all flights...

1157
01:15:47,063 --> 01:15:49,461
...that experienced[br]the same turbulence.

1158
01:15:49,669 --> 01:15:52,172
Harold Anderson was[br]on all these flights.

1159
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:56,760
Explain that, and you won't hear[br]any more from me about this subject.

1160
01:15:58,219 --> 01:16:01,556
It's too small. Try raising[br]your hands over your head.

1161
01:16:03,433 --> 01:16:06,144
How often do you raise your hands[br]higher than this?

1162
01:16:06,353 --> 01:16:08,855
-It's perfect.[br]-No, I'll exchange it.

1163
01:16:09,794 --> 01:16:11,775
Your turn. I got you a present.

1164
01:16:12,296 --> 01:16:13,860
Open it.

1165
01:16:16,154 --> 01:16:17,614
All right.

1166
01:16:26,373 --> 01:16:28,354
The crib!

1167
01:16:29,709 --> 01:16:32,837
This is the one I wanted.

1168
01:16:33,046 --> 01:16:37,008
This one's for the baby, but maybe[br]you can both squeeze into it.

1169
01:16:38,259 --> 01:16:39,823
Oh, God.

1170
01:16:40,136 --> 01:16:41,492
What's wrong?

1171
01:16:42,743 --> 01:16:44,411
I'm being ripped apart!

1172
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:45,767
It's okay. Hang on.

1173
01:16:45,975 --> 01:16:47,122
Stop driving so fast.

1174
01:16:47,331 --> 01:16:50,563
-I thought you wanted me to hurry.[br]-I do, but slow down!

1175
01:17:13,503 --> 01:17:14,545
God!

1176
01:17:14,754 --> 01:17:16,422
-Is this pain normal?[br]-Yes.

1177
01:17:16,944 --> 01:17:19,238
This pain is normal.[br]That's a good sign.

1178
01:17:19,446 --> 01:17:21,219
Shut up, asshole!

1179
01:17:21,427 --> 01:17:22,887
She's fine.

1180
01:17:27,162 --> 01:17:29,456
-They're not home.[br]-The Andersons?

1181
01:17:29,665 --> 01:17:31,959
They're at the hospital[br]having their baby.

1182
01:17:32,271 --> 01:17:33,418
I love babies.

1183
01:17:33,627 --> 01:17:34,774
Shit. Which hospital?

1184
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:37,589
She told me a couple of weeks ago.

1185
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:41,343
-It's a woman's name.[br]-Think.

1186
01:17:42,907 --> 01:17:43,950
St. Agnes!

1187
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:46,974
No, wait. That's my name.

1188
01:17:48,538 --> 01:17:50,727
It was St. Agatha's.

1189
01:17:52,083 --> 01:17:53,334
Come on.

1190
01:17:55,211 --> 01:17:57,296
Give us another push, Susan.

1191
01:17:58,652 --> 01:18:00,320
Why are so many people here?

1192
01:18:00,529 --> 01:18:03,344
Considering the unusual nature[br]of your pregnancy...

1193
01:18:03,553 --> 01:18:06,264
...l thought we should have[br]specialists on hand.

1194
01:18:06,576 --> 01:18:09,183
-Should that make me feel better?[br]-BP's dropping.

1195
01:18:09,392 --> 01:18:11,269
We'll have to do a C-section.

1196
01:18:11,477 --> 01:18:12,937
-God help me.[br]-Hold it!

1197
01:18:13,145 --> 01:18:14,292
I see the head.

1198
01:18:15,022 --> 01:18:17,733
Keep pushing, Susan.[br]Give me some pushes.

1199
01:18:18,046 --> 01:18:20,132
Please. Please.

1200
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:26,492
-What's happening?[br]-One second.

1201
01:18:26,701 --> 01:18:28,577
All right, suction here, please.

1202
01:18:29,620 --> 01:18:32,957
-Oh, God, I can't hear my baby.[br]-I can't see anything.

1203
01:18:35,981 --> 01:18:40,151
This is the strangest,[br]most incredible....

1204
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:42,758
Mr. and Mrs. Anderson...

1205
01:18:44,531 --> 01:18:48,285
...say hello to your completely[br]healthy, new baby boy.

1206
01:18:54,228 --> 01:18:56,730
Don't tell anyone about[br]this three-month pregnancy.

1207
01:18:57,356 --> 01:18:59,233
Everyone will want one.

1208
01:18:59,754 --> 01:19:01,110
You okay?

1209
01:19:01,735 --> 01:19:04,864
We had him. We made this.[br]This is us!

1210
01:19:07,992 --> 01:19:09,556
It's a miracle.

1211
01:19:20,713 --> 01:19:23,528
I can't wait to see him again.

1212
01:19:25,301 --> 01:19:28,220
You were so cute in the delivery room.

1213
01:19:29,054 --> 01:19:32,599
I'll always remember your face[br]when they handed him to you.

1214
01:19:33,329 --> 01:19:35,102
I want you to remember that.

1215
01:19:35,936 --> 01:19:37,396
What's wrong?

1216
01:19:38,856 --> 01:19:40,628
Harold, what is it?

1217
01:19:41,150 --> 01:19:42,401
I have to leave.

1218
01:19:43,235 --> 01:19:44,486
Leave the hospital?

1219
01:19:45,946 --> 01:19:47,197
Yeah.

1220
01:19:47,406 --> 01:19:48,866
When will you be back?

1221
01:19:51,785 --> 01:19:53,349
I'm not coming back.

1222
01:19:54,809 --> 01:19:55,748
What?

1223
01:19:56,790 --> 01:19:59,397
I don't want to go. I have to.

1224
01:20:01,378 --> 01:20:02,838
You're not coming back?

1225
01:20:07,009 --> 01:20:09,511
No. Maybe I should've just left.

1226
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:11,701
This seems worse.

1227
01:20:19,104 --> 01:20:20,772
-Can I help you?[br]-Harold Anderson?

1228
01:20:20,981 --> 01:20:22,441
His wife is having a baby.

1229
01:20:22,649 --> 01:20:25,986
They're in the maternity wing,[br]in the delivery room.

1230
01:20:26,716 --> 01:20:31,617
You can't go in there, sir![br]Sir, you are not allowed in there!

1231
01:20:31,825 --> 01:20:34,328
Get out. Get the hell away from me.

1232
01:20:34,536 --> 01:20:37,977
I don't believe it. I did it again!

1233
01:20:38,186 --> 01:20:39,541
I did it again!

1234
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:40,897
I know you're angry.

1235
01:20:41,418 --> 01:20:45,172
You coward! Two minutes with[br]your child and you're scared shitless.

1236
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:47,987
Get him out! Get him out of here!

1237
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:49,343
Get out!

1238
01:20:50,281 --> 01:20:52,054
Get out!

1239
01:21:01,855 --> 01:21:04,670
-I need to talk to Harold Anderson.[br]-Is he in the military?

1240
01:21:04,879 --> 01:21:06,756
-Where is he?[br]-Wife's here. He's gone.

1241
01:21:06,964 --> 01:21:08,737
-Can I talk to her?[br]-Not a good time.

1242
01:21:08,945 --> 01:21:11,448
If you find him,[br]give him a kick in the pants.

1243
01:21:11,656 --> 01:21:14,055
Soon as the baby's born,[br]he leaves his wife.

1244
01:21:14,263 --> 01:21:15,619
What kind of person is that?

1245
01:21:15,827 --> 01:21:18,121
He's going back.[br]I know where he is.

1246
01:21:21,041 --> 01:21:23,022
Excuse me, chief. Merry Christmas.

1247
01:21:23,230 --> 01:21:27,923
I'm looking for a passenger.[br]Harold Anderson, usual spelling.

1248
01:21:30,425 --> 01:21:32,406
We're just about to push away.

1249
01:22:08,379 --> 01:22:10,152
So they gave her a C-section.

1250
01:22:10,361 --> 01:22:12,238
Dr. Weitzman, we've got a problem.

1251
01:22:12,446 --> 01:22:14,844
-What is it?[br]-It's about the Anderson baby.

1252
01:22:15,053 --> 01:22:18,911
The captain has turned off[br]the "fasten seat belt" sign.

1253
01:22:19,119 --> 01:22:21,830
For your safety and the safety[br]of those around you...

1254
01:22:22,039 --> 01:22:26,105
... we suggest you remain seated[br]with your seat belt fastened.

1255
01:22:26,314 --> 01:22:28,295
Thank you and enjoy your flight.

1256
01:22:28,504 --> 01:22:30,485
Excuse me. I need to get by.

1257
01:22:30,693 --> 01:22:33,613
Why is it you pack what you need[br]where you can't get it?

1258
01:22:33,821 --> 01:22:35,281
Why are the aisles so narrow?

1259
01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:39,035
Do I look like fucking Andy Rooney?[br]Get out of the way!

1260
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:54,467
Excuse me.

1261
01:22:54,676 --> 01:22:57,178
Watch your back. Coming through.

1262
01:22:57,387 --> 01:23:00,515
Watch your back.[br]Excuse me. Coming through.

1263
01:23:18,866 --> 01:23:21,786
No, no, I'm okay.[br]I don't need anything.

1264
01:23:21,994 --> 01:23:23,663
Just a mild sedative.

1265
01:23:23,871 --> 01:23:27,312
It'll help keep you calm[br]while you recuperate.

1266
01:23:30,545 --> 01:23:35,654
I know you've had some bad news, and[br]believe me, I hate to give you more.

1267
01:23:37,426 --> 01:23:40,346
We believe that your husband[br]has taken the baby.

1268
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:45,038
We've contacted the authorities.

1269
01:23:46,602 --> 01:23:47,645
I'm fired?

1270
01:23:48,271 --> 01:23:53,067
-You're just taking your sabbatical.[br]-That will bring you to retirement.

1271
01:23:53,276 --> 01:23:54,214
So I'm fired.

1272
01:23:54,631 --> 01:23:59,115
No, you're taking a sabbatical,[br]and then you're retiring.

1273
01:24:00,262 --> 01:24:04,328
I saw him walk into the lavatory.[br]When I opened the door, he was gone.

1274
01:24:04,954 --> 01:24:08,290
Are you aware of what you're saying?

1275
01:24:08,499 --> 01:24:10,689
Just enjoy your time off.

1276
01:24:10,897 --> 01:24:12,148
Rest.

1277
01:24:18,926 --> 01:24:21,637
Bastard. Bastard!

1278
01:24:50,103 --> 01:24:52,814
I have to go buy[br]a remote control for the TV set.

1279
01:24:53,022 --> 01:24:55,734
Don't let me stop you.[br]Have a wonderful time.

1280
01:24:55,942 --> 01:24:59,279
I want to shop for baby clothes,[br]but we won't worry about that.

1281
01:24:59,487 --> 01:25:02,720
The baby can go naked[br]the first year of its life. Go.

1282
01:25:05,431 --> 01:25:06,369
Go.

1283
01:25:08,246 --> 01:25:09,289
So I go?

1284
01:25:09,497 --> 01:25:12,834
No, you don't go.[br]See, that's the interesting thing.

1285
01:25:13,042 --> 01:25:14,711
But she told me to go.

1286
01:25:15,441 --> 01:25:17,943
There's a whole layer here[br]you're missing.

1287
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:21,593
Now you know what I had to deal with.[br]Take your seat.

1288
01:25:22,948 --> 01:25:25,555
This isn't easy,[br]so don't beat yourself up over it.

1289
01:25:25,763 --> 01:25:26,910
What does that mean?

1290
01:25:28,057 --> 01:25:29,726
Just sit down.

1291
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:31,707
I've...

1292
01:25:36,399 --> 01:25:40,257
...reprogrammed the computer[br]to more accurately represent...

1293
01:25:40,466 --> 01:25:42,551
...what you'll deal with on Earth.

1294
01:25:42,759 --> 01:25:46,826
If you look for an overriding[br]logic or rationality...

1295
01:25:47,556 --> 01:25:49,641
...remember it's Earth[br]we're dealing with.

1296
01:25:49,850 --> 01:25:52,561
-I guess you don't like my friends.[br]-I like them.

1297
01:25:52,978 --> 01:25:55,898
You barely acknowledged them.[br]What's wrong with you?

1298
01:25:56,106 --> 01:25:58,504
If you don't talk,[br]how will I know what's wrong?

1299
01:25:59,234 --> 01:26:01,841
You gotta open up.[br]You gotta communica--

1300
01:26:04,761 --> 01:26:06,637
I guess you don't like my friends.

1301
01:26:06,846 --> 01:26:09,661
You barely acknowledged them.[br]What's wrong with you?

1302
01:26:09,870 --> 01:26:12,581
If you don't talk,[br]how will I know what's wrong?

1303
01:26:12,789 --> 01:26:14,458
I mean, you've gotta com--

1304
01:26:16,647 --> 01:26:20,505
It goes on and on like that for hours.

1305
01:26:21,131 --> 01:26:24,676
Human relationships are filled[br]with conflict.

1306
01:26:26,553 --> 01:26:30,620
The whole planet is filled with[br]conflict, which isn't a bad thing.

1307
01:26:30,828 --> 01:26:34,061
Through conflict[br]we learn about ourselves.

1308
01:26:35,416 --> 01:26:37,189
I don't understand this.

1309
01:26:40,838 --> 01:26:42,298
Questions?

1310
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:47,407
I see some confused faces.

1311
01:26:47,616 --> 01:26:49,284
You see...

1312
01:26:49,493 --> 01:26:53,246
...on our planet,[br]we have no emotion or conflicts...

1313
01:26:53,455 --> 01:26:57,000
...so we've never had[br]to look inward at ourselves.

1314
01:26:57,626 --> 01:27:02,109
That helped us become a technological,[br]intellectual force in the universe...

1315
01:27:02,318 --> 01:27:04,925
...but I really think it's a dead end.

1316
01:27:06,176 --> 01:27:10,138
To be honest with you, I question[br]why we're taking over Earth.

1317
01:27:10,868 --> 01:27:15,143
Why make them like us, when[br]in fact we can learn from them?

1318
01:27:15,352 --> 01:27:18,063
And they can remind us[br]of who we were before--

1319
01:27:19,314 --> 01:27:20,565
Excuse me.

1320
01:27:23,589 --> 01:27:25,779
Why does Graydon want to see me?

1321
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:29,115
If you don't talk to me,[br]I won't know what's wrong.

1322
01:27:40,585 --> 01:27:43,088
Hey, my baby! That's my baby.

1323
01:27:43,609 --> 01:27:46,633
Wait a minute.[br]What's my baby doing here? Stop.

1324
01:27:47,467 --> 01:27:49,657
Wait a minute. Stop!

1325
01:27:52,472 --> 01:27:54,140
You can't pollute the others.

1326
01:27:54,349 --> 01:27:56,226
-Why's my son here?[br]-You're raising your voice.

1327
01:27:56,434 --> 01:27:59,041
You bet I am.[br]You never told me you'd take the baby.

1328
01:27:59,562 --> 01:28:02,169
Did you tell anyone who you were[br]and why you were there?

1329
01:28:02,378 --> 01:28:04,046
-A woman in a bar.[br]-We took care of her.

1330
01:28:04,254 --> 01:28:07,070
Anyone else?[br]Anyone you told will be disposed of.

1331
01:28:07,278 --> 01:28:09,468
Why are we taking over Earth?[br]How much do we need?

1332
01:28:09,677 --> 01:28:11,449
Is that what it's about? More?

1333
01:28:11,658 --> 01:28:14,786
I'm sending you[br]to the purification centre.

1334
01:28:15,516 --> 01:28:19,791
Take him. I don't want him to[br]remember his time there or the baby.

1335
01:28:27,611 --> 01:28:29,592
Get out of my way!

1336
01:29:04,314 --> 01:29:06,295
Get back! Put your weapons down.

1337
01:29:06,504 --> 01:29:09,632
Put your weapons down.[br]You're scaring the baby.

1338
01:29:15,158 --> 01:29:19,225
See? See what you did? I told you[br]you were scaring the baby.

1339
01:29:19,433 --> 01:29:20,476
Turn that thing off!

1340
01:29:20,685 --> 01:29:24,855
Turn it off? You're the one who[br]got it started. You turn it off.

1341
01:29:25,377 --> 01:29:26,628
Turn it off.

1342
01:29:26,837 --> 01:29:29,235
This thing will blow.[br]That's what they do.

1343
01:29:29,443 --> 01:29:33,823
This is how it starts. It gets worse[br]and worse, and then they explode.

1344
01:29:34,031 --> 01:29:35,804
There'll be baby all over the place.

1345
01:29:44,667 --> 01:29:46,648
That's my boy.

1346
01:30:01,871 --> 01:30:04,687
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1347
01:30:05,208 --> 01:30:08,336
Just please let me know[br]as soon as you hear anything.

1348
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:15,010
Somebody spotted a man in Michigan.

1349
01:30:15,218 --> 01:30:18,868
Matches Harold's description,[br]and he was carrying a baby.

1350
01:30:21,266 --> 01:30:22,621
Hi.

1351
01:30:23,143 --> 01:30:24,707
Hi, Liz. Alison.

1352
01:30:28,252 --> 01:30:30,337
-He's fine.[br]-You bastard!

1353
01:30:30,546 --> 01:30:31,901
He's fine.

1354
01:30:43,684 --> 01:30:44,727
Oh, God.

1355
01:30:44,935 --> 01:30:46,395
Do you have any idea...

1356
01:30:46,604 --> 01:30:50,357
...what I've been through[br]in the last two days? Any clue?

1357
01:30:50,566 --> 01:30:53,590
I'm sure it's been awful.[br]That's why I brought him back.

1358
01:30:54,111 --> 01:30:57,552
How could you take him?[br]How could you do this?

1359
01:30:58,073 --> 01:30:59,950
-How, Harold?[br]-I didn't.

1360
01:31:00,159 --> 01:31:02,348
-Then who did?[br]-Not me.

1361
01:31:03,078 --> 01:31:06,102
Why would I expect you to tell[br]the truth at this point?

1362
01:31:06,311 --> 01:31:08,500
How sick am l?

1363
01:31:09,230 --> 01:31:10,794
Would you take him?

1364
01:31:15,591 --> 01:31:17,468
I'll be right there.

1365
01:31:22,264 --> 01:31:25,809
I have to know[br]how you could do this to me.

1366
01:31:26,435 --> 01:31:28,937
-How, Harold?[br]-I'll tell you the truth.

1367
01:31:29,771 --> 01:31:32,065
-All right.[br]-I will.

1368
01:31:33,004 --> 01:31:34,985
I can wait. Go ahead.

1369
01:31:41,033 --> 01:31:43,118
I'm an alien from another planet.

1370
01:31:43,327 --> 01:31:46,455
I was sent here to impregnate[br]a woman, then go back.

1371
01:31:46,663 --> 01:31:51,251
Graydon, the leader, came[br]and took the baby without telling me.

1372
01:31:51,460 --> 01:31:53,858
So I stole the baby back.

1373
01:31:54,275 --> 01:31:58,967
And now I'm here.[br]Is there any way we can start over?

1374
01:31:59,906 --> 01:32:02,512
Is there a history of[br]mental illness in your family?

1375
01:32:02,721 --> 01:32:03,972
I care about you.

1376
01:32:04,598 --> 01:32:08,873
-Our son should be with his mother.[br]-This is my son.

1377
01:32:09,081 --> 01:32:13,461
This is my son. This is not our son.

1378
01:32:14,399 --> 01:32:17,527
There's no " us" anymore,[br]so there can't be any "our."

1379
01:32:17,736 --> 01:32:19,717
I'm calling the police now.

1380
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:22,637
-I can prove I'm an alien.[br]-Really?

1381
01:32:22,845 --> 01:32:25,243
I can make a bright light[br]come out of my nose.

1382
01:32:25,452 --> 01:32:28,267
That must be handy when[br]you can't find a flashlight.

1383
01:32:28,580 --> 01:32:32,438
I can show you. Or you can take[br]my word for it and trust me.

1384
01:32:32,647 --> 01:32:33,794
Trust you?

1385
01:32:34,419 --> 01:32:36,922
Trust you?[br]I should trust a man that--

1386
01:32:53,292 --> 01:32:55,690
I thought I did[br]everything right this time.

1387
01:32:55,899 --> 01:33:00,278
But no, I married an alien[br]from another planet.

1388
01:33:05,283 --> 01:33:08,203
I could never give you[br]what you want. I'm not human.

1389
01:33:08,724 --> 01:33:11,227
I could never understand what love is.

1390
01:33:11,644 --> 01:33:15,085
I hope, as time goes by,[br]you'll be able to forgive me.

1391
01:33:18,421 --> 01:33:19,985
Goodbye.

1392
01:33:31,455 --> 01:33:36,043
Well, well, well, I was right.[br]I wasn't crazy. I was right.

1393
01:33:36,251 --> 01:33:37,398
Congratulations.

1394
01:33:37,607 --> 01:33:41,778
-My wife didn't believe me.[br]-Mine didn't believe me either.

1395
01:33:41,986 --> 01:33:43,446
Don't get me started.

1396
01:33:44,176 --> 01:33:46,366
What will you do now? Take me in?

1397
01:33:46,574 --> 01:33:48,451
To where? My bosses fired me.

1398
01:33:48,660 --> 01:33:50,954
I could give a rat's ass about them.

1399
01:33:51,162 --> 01:33:54,290
I had to know the truth for me.[br]As a man.

1400
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:56,480
I hear you.

1401
01:33:57,001 --> 01:33:59,817
What was the plan?[br]World domination, right?

1402
01:34:00,234 --> 01:34:02,111
-Isn't it always?[br]-Tell me about it.

1403
01:34:02,945 --> 01:34:05,864
I'm really in Dutch with the wife[br]about this whole deal.

1404
01:34:06,073 --> 01:34:10,244
If you show her that nose-light thing,[br]it'd get me out of the doghouse.

1405
01:34:10,452 --> 01:34:12,642
-My pleasure.[br]-Great. Let's go.

1406
01:34:12,850 --> 01:34:14,310
No one's going anywhere.

1407
01:34:14,727 --> 01:34:17,438
-Who's this guy?[br]-This is the leader of my planet.

1408
01:34:17,647 --> 01:34:18,898
No shit.

1409
01:34:19,107 --> 01:34:22,443
You've placed us in a very[br]difficult position. Come with me.

1410
01:34:22,860 --> 01:34:25,571
I don't know what[br]your thing is with him...

1411
01:34:25,780 --> 01:34:28,387
...but he's gotta go[br]see my wife first, okay?

1412
01:34:28,595 --> 01:34:32,349
You appear intelligent, but when you[br]open your mouth, the effect is spoiled.

1413
01:34:33,079 --> 01:34:34,747
You might want to drop that.

1414
01:34:34,956 --> 01:34:39,544
Fool. I have a highly evolved brain[br]that can block intense pain...

1415
01:34:39,752 --> 01:34:43,506
...and also heal any injury[br]within a matter of seconds.

1416
01:34:43,819 --> 01:34:45,070
You cannot hurt me.

1417
01:34:55,288 --> 01:34:58,521
I had a feeling that heal-any-injury[br]thing was bullshit.

1418
01:35:06,862 --> 01:35:10,408
-Who's that?[br]-Graydon, the leader of my planet.

1419
01:35:10,616 --> 01:35:14,370
-Is he dead?[br]-Yeah. He just killed him.

1420
01:35:15,830 --> 01:35:18,124
I have to talk to you about something.

1421
01:35:18,332 --> 01:35:19,896
I should probably run along.

1422
01:35:21,460 --> 01:35:26,153
I was just wondering if[br]it'd be okay if, you know....

1423
01:35:27,717 --> 01:35:29,385
Can I have him?

1424
01:35:29,802 --> 01:35:30,949
I don't see why not.

1425
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:33,556
Excuse me.

1426
01:35:39,603 --> 01:35:42,314
Great. Nice meeting both of you.[br]Take care.

1427
01:35:44,191 --> 01:35:48,154
To be clear, this really was[br]the leader of your planet, right?

1428
01:35:48,362 --> 01:35:52,116
If it's your insurance agent,[br]I'm in deep shit.

1429
01:35:52,846 --> 01:35:53,993
You're okay, man.

1430
01:35:54,618 --> 01:35:55,765
Thanks.

1431
01:35:56,704 --> 01:35:59,936
I got an alien, I got an alien!

1432
01:36:02,230 --> 01:36:05,254
You know what you said[br]about not knowing what love is?

1433
01:36:06,818 --> 01:36:09,529
Well, I don't know either.

1434
01:36:10,050 --> 01:36:11,093
Really?

1435
01:36:11,719 --> 01:36:16,202
No, but you married me.[br]We had a child.

1436
01:36:16,411 --> 01:36:18,809
You rescued him[br]and brought him back to me...

1437
01:36:19,748 --> 01:36:23,397
...and then told me the truth[br]about who you really are.

1438
01:36:24,127 --> 01:36:26,421
Maybe that's your way[br]of saying you love me?

1439
01:36:26,942 --> 01:36:28,506
I don't know.

1440
01:36:30,592 --> 01:36:32,051
Me too.

1441
01:36:49,465 --> 01:36:51,863
Let us celebrate[br]with Susan and Harold...

1442
01:36:52,071 --> 01:36:54,782
...as they renew their marriage vows.

1443
01:36:55,095 --> 01:36:58,849
Let this also be a time for[br]the rest of us to reflect upon...

1444
01:36:59,057 --> 01:37:03,854
...and make a renewed spiritual[br]commitment to our own vows and unions.

1445
01:37:04,062 --> 01:37:07,086
Harold and Susan have written[br]their own vows.

1446
01:37:07,399 --> 01:37:09,485
Harold, would you like to start?

1447
01:37:16,992 --> 01:37:21,684
Susan, when I married you the first[br]time, I did it to get into your pants.

1448
01:37:21,997 --> 01:37:26,168
Now I'm doing it because I want to[br]spend my life getting into your pants.

1449
01:37:28,879 --> 01:37:30,339
Thank you for marrying me.

1450
01:37:30,756 --> 01:37:35,448
And I will do everything possible[br]to make you and our new son...

1451
01:37:37,429 --> 01:37:38,784
Aaron.

1452
01:37:38,993 --> 01:37:41,496
...Aaron, very happy.

1453
01:37:42,434 --> 01:37:44,311
-That was beautiful.[br]-Thank you.

1454
01:37:44,519 --> 01:37:46,188
And now you, Susan.

1455
01:37:46,813 --> 01:37:51,193
Harold, meeting you taught me the[br]universe is one screwed-up place...

1456
01:37:51,401 --> 01:37:54,529
...where everyone's trying[br]to work out their problems.

1457
01:37:54,738 --> 01:37:59,743
But I'm honoured to work them out[br]with you, because I think I love you.

1458
01:37:59,951 --> 01:38:01,828
Very cosmic.

1459
01:38:02,037 --> 01:38:05,582
And with that, I again[br]pronounce you man and wife.

1460
01:38:05,791 --> 01:38:07,876
You may now kiss.

1461
01:38:19,659 --> 01:38:21,223
That was great.

1462
01:38:21,431 --> 01:38:23,934
-That was the wedding I always wanted.[br]-I know.

1463
01:38:24,142 --> 01:38:26,332
What a perfect day.

1464
01:38:26,645 --> 01:38:28,521
Your friends seem nice.

1465
01:38:28,730 --> 01:38:31,337
I didn't want to bring this up[br]until after the ceremony...

1466
01:38:31,545 --> 01:38:34,569
...but they want me[br]to be leader of the planet.

1467
01:38:35,195 --> 01:38:37,384
-You're kidding.[br]-No.

1468
01:38:37,593 --> 01:38:41,451
-What did you say?[br]-I told them I had to talk to you.

1469
01:38:42,077 --> 01:38:44,371
That's quite an honour.[br]I'm proud of you.

1470
01:38:44,579 --> 01:38:47,916
Thanks. But it means[br]we'd have to move there.

1471
01:38:49,271 --> 01:38:51,878
I could commute,[br]but that's a long commute.

1472
01:38:52,087 --> 01:38:54,276
All my friends are here.

1473
01:38:54,485 --> 01:38:57,196
Who? Liz and Alison[br]and what's-her-name?

1474
01:38:57,404 --> 01:38:59,281
-Why do you have to do that?[br]-Sorry.

1475
01:38:59,490 --> 01:39:03,556
I know nothing about your planet. I[br]don't know what the schools are like.

1476
01:39:03,765 --> 01:39:06,789
We're 1 000 years ahead.[br]What do you think they're like?

1477
01:39:06,997 --> 01:39:09,395
You're going too fast for the baby.

1478
01:39:09,604 --> 01:39:13,254
Don't start. The baby was fine[br]in the transporter chamber.

1479
01:39:13,462 --> 01:39:16,486
Four solar systems,[br]I never heard a peep.

1480
01:39:19,614 --> 01:39:22,116
Okay, I'll commute.
