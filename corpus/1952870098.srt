1
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,985
Here we are.

2
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,940
Freedom.

3
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:51,022
Dorosul!

4
00:03:57,072 --> 00:03:58,948
You all try to remove it.

5
00:04:03,472 --> 00:04:06,430
Was it painful...
trying?

6
00:04:07,192 --> 00:04:10,980
My faith is done,
I will not return.

7
00:04:10,992 --> 00:04:13,011
The Shadow cannot be embraced,

8
00:04:13,112 --> 00:04:15,312
and then cast aside.

9
00:04:15,712 --> 00:04:18,867
A Legate can not turn
from his call.

10
00:04:19,632 --> 00:04:21,985
Why do you do this?

11
00:04:22,392 --> 00:04:25,828
You are his...
forever.

12
00:04:28,872 --> 00:04:30,624
Amusing.

13
00:04:33,493 --> 00:04:37,486
I return you...
to Izrador.

14
00:05:03,613 --> 00:05:08,608
Countless ages ago, the dark god
Izrador was cast out of heavens..

15
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:11,509
and banned to the wastes
of the Earth.

16
00:05:12,753 --> 00:05:15,971
With his fall
a great vail decented.

17
00:05:16,054 --> 00:05:19,465
Separating the mortal world
from the heavens...

18
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:23,666
separating the gods
from their creation.

19
00:05:24,594 --> 00:05:27,112
Izrador, the Shadow of the North...

20
00:05:27,413 --> 00:05:32,213
gathered about him creatures
of evil and darkness.

21
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:38,870
He lashed out in conquest,
against the free races of the world.

22
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:48,033
Led by Aradil the Witch Queen of the Elves
the free races repelled his attacks.

23
00:05:51,974 --> 00:05:55,783
But Izrador was not defeated.

24
00:05:56,514 --> 00:06:02,129
In the third war the Dark Gods
struck against the South again.

25
00:06:03,675 --> 00:06:08,430
This time the free races
were caught unprepared.

26
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:14,232
This time, the Dark Lord won.

27
00:06:16,715 --> 00:06:21,914
Now the lands are clutched
in the iron hand of occupation,

28
00:06:22,235 --> 00:06:27,092
The Legates... black priests
and servants of Izrador...

29
00:06:27,293 --> 00:06:31,593
govern the lands
fom the city of Teros Obsidia.

30
00:06:34,075 --> 00:06:40,345
Like a retreating tide,
hope and magic fade from the world.

31
00:06:40,956 --> 00:06:46,667
It has been a hundred years
since the Shadow fell.

32
00:06:59,276 --> 00:07:00,468
Relax?

33
00:07:00,496 --> 00:07:02,634
Next you'll be asking me
to meditate?

34
00:07:02,636 --> 00:07:06,870
No one made you wait under the stench
of hemp collared elf all day.

35
00:07:06,976 --> 00:07:09,774
We suffer so that the Shadow
may be strong.

36
00:07:09,836 --> 00:07:12,953
We chased that errant alter boy
half way across Eredane.

37
00:07:12,996 --> 00:07:15,812
A fortnight's rest in a pleasure district,
is that to much to ask?

38
00:07:15,816 --> 00:07:17,371
- Rest?
- Where?

39
00:07:17,476 --> 00:07:18,994
Diverson.

40
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:24,226
One night, Kruce.
Then we return Teros Obsidia.

41
00:07:25,637 --> 00:07:27,253
Now, now...

42
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:29,155
Who's that?

43
00:07:36,737 --> 00:07:38,846
So far from the Tower, Chuzara?

44
00:07:39,217 --> 00:07:41,394
Geddon send word to you, Mag.

45
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:44,268
I should like to give that old crow
a word or two myself.

46
00:07:45,317 --> 00:07:46,628
Who's the leech?

47
00:07:47,397 --> 00:07:49,527
Ooh, aren't we pleasent?

48
00:07:50,277 --> 00:07:53,416
Forgive, Kruce,
his honesty is useful.

49
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:56,629
Albeit at times...
inappropriate.

50
00:07:57,657 --> 00:08:00,231
You're to accompany me
to the village of Blackweir...

51
00:08:00,732 --> 00:08:02,332
to complete the temple there.

52
00:08:05,677 --> 00:08:08,197
Mundane work for Redeemer,
don't you think?

53
00:08:08,338 --> 00:08:10,366
- I'm surprised that Geddon...
- And to require...

54
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:12,167
as to the fate of Tosh Kamar.

55
00:08:12,768 --> 00:08:14,368
The leget gone missing.

56
00:08:17,218 --> 00:08:18,427
I see.

57
00:08:25,818 --> 00:08:27,977
What about the night
in the pleasure distict, Mag?

58
00:08:28,878 --> 00:08:29,878
Mag!

59
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:53,709
Concerns over that northland prophecy
are overblown, Geddon.

60
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:56,254
The First Legate
does not take them seriously.

61
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:58,137
I have no doubt
that Sunulael is correct...

62
00:08:58,219 --> 00:09:00,032
As he is in all things.

63
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:03,033
Still, there are members of the council
who feel differently.

64
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:05,957
One mustn't ignore any threat
against the Shadow.

65
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,658
No matter how unlikely that may be.

66
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,252
Of course not.

67
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:15,235
Yet, this fairy tale notion, of some
prophetic hero rising against us...

68
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,637
- is really quite childish.
- If you will... forgive me.

69
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:22,338
- I must prepare for my journey.
- But sill no word...

70
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:24,798
of the Legate gone missing
in the borderlands?

71
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:27,388
Have you no duties elsewhere, Haarn?

72
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:32,589
Tosh Kamar was sent to complete
that temple nearly 5 years ago, Geddon.

73
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,370
Our time runs short.

74
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,315
You may tell Sunulael that the fate
of Tosha Kamar will soon be known...

75
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,472
and that Blackweir temple
will be completed.

76
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,775
Splendid. He will be pleased.

77
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,375
May I ask who have you sent
to complete this formidable task?

78
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:55,734
A young leget...
One who has never failed me.

79
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:24,717
Who goes there?

80
00:10:25,281 --> 00:10:28,874
A servant of the Shadow has come.
Open the gate.

81
00:11:37,462 --> 00:11:40,673
Take what's useful...
burn the rest.

82
00:11:46,703 --> 00:11:48,302
Four wagons.

83
00:11:48,303 --> 00:11:49,352
He was right again.

84
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:51,182
Yes he was.

85
00:11:52,783 --> 00:11:54,283
We owe much to this informant.

86
00:11:54,823 --> 00:11:59,939
He says the mayor holds you...
holds us responsible for the heavy taxes.

87
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:05,199
Any thinking person in Blackweir,
knows the value of Lesher's accusations.

88
00:12:05,423 --> 00:12:07,113
Better to be taxed by her,

89
00:12:07,214 --> 00:12:10,314
than have a Legate temple
build in their midst.

90
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:12,979
I suppose you would know.

91
00:12:13,523 --> 00:12:14,993
I wish I did not.

92
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:20,459
Now... go.

93
00:13:03,524 --> 00:13:07,916
Oh, you always bring me
to the most cheerful places, Mag.

94
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:13,438
I expect by the time I die, I'll have seen
every dung heap west of the Kaladrun.

95
00:13:13,485 --> 00:13:17,684
Unlike the others, Kruce, you are free
to leave my service at any time.

96
00:13:17,685 --> 00:13:21,342
Oh, but then I would miss
your splendid company and...

97
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:23,743
your spectacular destinations.

98
00:13:23,745 --> 00:13:25,616
We're not here for revelry, Kruce.

99
00:13:25,617 --> 00:13:28,417
Not every task leads to the Lord's bliss.

100
00:13:28,485 --> 00:13:30,880
How's about just one, eh?

101
00:13:31,065 --> 00:13:35,124
One task that leads to a little bid
of bliss, or at least...

102
00:13:35,425 --> 00:13:39,725
one leading to a place that doesn't
smell like fish, or the insides of a boro.

103
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:44,895
To tell the truth...
I prefer the smell of fish.

104
00:13:45,085 --> 00:13:47,819
I go where Geddon sends me.

105
00:13:48,305 --> 00:13:51,921
Ho-ho. And if Geddon had a pipe
we'd never stop dancing.

106
00:13:52,026 --> 00:13:56,001
I say we find this missing Legate
with haste, my talents are wasted here.

107
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:59,103
What talent?
Pissing from a saddle?

108
00:13:59,646 --> 00:14:04,083
Oh! The acolite deigns
to speak to me!

109
00:14:04,446 --> 00:14:09,315
My dear, I speak of an intuition
verging on the unnatural.

110
00:14:09,406 --> 00:14:13,598
Razor wit, an unparalleled
sense of class, decendy...

111
00:14:13,646 --> 00:14:16,683
Oh, by the holy black bastard.

112
00:14:16,786 --> 00:14:18,943
This miserable hole
actually has a tavern.

113
00:14:19,244 --> 00:14:22,044
If you'll excuse me,
I have a thirst.

114
00:14:22,086 --> 00:14:24,395
You know what you are
tasked to do.

115
00:14:24,946 --> 00:14:28,958
Aye. And you know my devotion
to duty is unsurpassed...

116
00:14:29,046 --> 00:14:32,837
which is why, if you're seeking me,
I'll be in that tavern...

117
00:14:32,927 --> 00:14:36,039
fortifying myself with a bottle
and a woman.

118
00:14:38,287 --> 00:14:41,497
Perhabs... two of each.

119
00:14:42,787 --> 00:14:44,178
Pig.

120
00:14:54,967 --> 00:14:57,843
I know what little praise is given
to those who bring back our lost.

121
00:14:58,227 --> 00:15:01,644
I'm afraid, I've trained you
for a thankless duty, Mag.

122
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:05,721
You have taught me that the glory belongs
to the Shadow in the North.

123
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:10,722
To ask the name of my pray...
No more.

124
00:15:10,887 --> 00:15:14,319
Haam suggests that age
is dulling my abilities...

125
00:15:14,368 --> 00:15:17,905
so, I hope you'll prove to him
that he's mistaken.

126
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,003
Wait!

127
00:15:22,348 --> 00:15:26,399
This is no Legate symbol.
Explain!

128
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:28,877
- I don't know what it is.
- You don't know?

129
00:15:29,988 --> 00:15:31,926
It started to appear last winter.

130
00:15:31,988 --> 00:15:33,680
I was wary of asking the healers.

131
00:15:33,728 --> 00:15:36,303
A Redeemer...
showing weakness?

132
00:15:36,388 --> 00:15:37,685
Of course.

133
00:15:40,948 --> 00:15:44,165
Don't concern yourself, Mag.
We'll discuss it when you return.

134
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,599
As you say.

135
00:15:54,008 --> 00:15:55,338
Bie Rial!

136
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,384
This temple is not abandoned.

137
00:17:23,491 --> 00:17:30,244
A Legate still claims dominion here...
Even in death.

138
00:17:31,731 --> 00:17:33,340
A soul remains?

139
00:17:44,951 --> 00:17:49,905
I seek another.
The last of us to dwell in this place.

140
00:17:51,251 --> 00:17:55,570
Something else walks among you.
Something old.

141
00:17:55,671 --> 00:17:57,741
Something... strong.

142
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,041
What did he say?

143
00:18:01,631 --> 00:18:03,947
There are many spirits here.

144
00:18:04,571 --> 00:18:06,327
Mad with terror.

145
00:18:08,012 --> 00:18:13,045
But Tosh Kamar...
is not among them.

146
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:18,208
I offer tithe
from Landring Farm, Magistrate.

147
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:20,309
It's near the village of Fernglade.

148
00:19:21,033 --> 00:19:24,611
Tithes from the forest villages
have been dismal.

149
00:19:25,553 --> 00:19:29,028
I hope this "hunter"
hasn't foolishly emboldened you people...

150
00:19:29,073 --> 00:19:32,689
to withhold your dues.
That would be a tragic...

151
00:19:33,034 --> 00:19:36,527
mistake,
if you take my meaning.

152
00:19:50,194 --> 00:19:51,464
Liana!

153
00:19:58,094 --> 00:20:00,210
Liana?

154
00:20:02,174 --> 00:20:06,445
I can't talk, Gaelen.
Don't follow me.

155
00:20:09,534 --> 00:20:10,950
It's been years.

156
00:20:11,674 --> 00:20:14,648
I can't let you go again
without some kind of exlanati...

157
00:20:16,535 --> 00:20:18,365
Go home, Gaelen.

158
00:20:37,175 --> 00:20:39,253
Doros Gharuck.

159
00:20:40,655 --> 00:20:45,390
I come into this dark...
to relieve you of your call.

160
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:50,914
Oso...
Isharam... Nosfo.

161
00:20:50,915 --> 00:20:58,070
Doros Ushaan!
I claim this place.

162
00:20:59,971 --> 00:21:02,371
Oso... Izra... Jemez.

163
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:19,809
Barash!

164
00:21:29,776 --> 00:21:35,394
Return... now...
to the Shadow in the North!

165
00:21:50,617 --> 00:21:52,872
They have gone to Izrador.

166
00:21:56,477 --> 00:22:01,087
This temple...
passes to me.

167
00:22:42,118 --> 00:22:46,350
And what may the town mayor do
for our master builder?

168
00:22:46,978 --> 00:22:50,332
I told you I'd flay you children
if you ever came to me in the open.

169
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:55,015
Someone has come.

170
00:22:55,238 --> 00:22:56,276
Someone?

171
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:59,533
A Legate...
From the tower.

172
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:02,736
You told me the Tower wouldn't send
another priests so soon.

173
00:23:03,018 --> 00:23:05,952
I don't think this is
an ordinary priest, Lesher.

174
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:15,152
Perhaps we have delayed the construction
of the temple for too long.

175
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:20,132
Even with the outlaw attacks...
I fear our excuses have run thin.

176
00:23:20,739 --> 00:23:22,458
- Perhaps we should...
- Has that Legate...

177
00:23:22,459 --> 00:23:24,659
stolen your manhood, Dolan?

178
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:30,157
'Cause I assure you... if you give me cause
to doubt your loyalty, I will.

179
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:32,818
How many more chickens
will your pens hold?

180
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:36,991
The capacity of my pens
is none of your concern.

181
00:23:37,699 --> 00:23:41,112
I will decide
when our enterprise is complete.

182
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:46,393
And you wil keep informing me
of those temple supply caravans.

183
00:23:46,739 --> 00:23:48,730
But above all, Dolan...

184
00:23:49,731 --> 00:23:53,931
you'll hold your tonque
and leave this Legate to me.

185
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,800
May I ask a question?

186
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,579
Would that I could guarantee
all the answers.

187
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,054
How many have you killed?

188
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:23,429
Traitors, you mean...
Fallen Legates.

189
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,595
Eight.

190
00:24:30,296 --> 00:24:32,396
I have raptured eight.

191
00:24:33,761 --> 00:24:38,496
How do you feel...
to kill another Legate?

192
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:44,795
When one casts aside
the grace of the Shadow.

193
00:24:45,296 --> 00:24:46,696
Becomes pale...

194
00:24:47,801 --> 00:24:51,576
from that moment
he is no longer a Legate.

195
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,159
What do you read in the flames, Deleth?

196
00:25:36,822 --> 00:25:40,561
I was looking inward,
not out.

197
00:25:42,782 --> 00:25:44,216
If you say so.

198
00:25:46,942 --> 00:25:50,981
Your raid...
It was a success?

199
00:25:57,763 --> 00:26:01,654
Where are the elves?
Your companions?

200
00:26:02,503 --> 00:26:07,636
They have returned to Caradul.
We've placed your provisions over there.

201
00:26:09,663 --> 00:26:11,197
But you stayed?

202
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:14,477
I have another task here.

203
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:16,416
Here?

204
00:26:16,703 --> 00:26:17,875
In Blackweir.

205
00:26:18,683 --> 00:26:21,277
What could an elf
possibly want there?

206
00:26:25,783 --> 00:26:26,961
Forget I ask.

207
00:26:30,503 --> 00:26:32,475
There is something you should know.

208
00:26:34,623 --> 00:26:37,359
Another Legate has arrived in Blackweir.

209
00:26:38,503 --> 00:26:40,559
This is ill tidings.

210
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,760
You are sure?

211
00:26:46,261 --> 00:26:48,261
You have seen this Legate?

212
00:26:51,024 --> 00:26:55,462
It has been years...
since I did this.

213
00:26:57,444 --> 00:27:04,963
Sometimes... before the storm comes,
I can feel it again.

214
00:27:04,964 --> 00:27:07,164
Feel... His call.

215
00:27:08,265 --> 00:27:09,765
His mark.

216
00:27:13,004 --> 00:27:15,182
I can feel it now.

217
00:27:22,365 --> 00:27:24,479
There is a prophecy, Chuzara.

218
00:27:25,065 --> 00:27:31,135
It foretells the rise of an enemy...
in this, the Last Age.

219
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:35,535
One that will threaten the dominion
of our lord.

220
00:27:36,765 --> 00:27:38,959
A formidable warrior...

221
00:27:39,745 --> 00:27:46,259
It is written that the earth, that...
Arith herself, cries out for him.

222
00:28:02,485 --> 00:28:04,135
You never sent word.

223
00:28:05,286 --> 00:28:06,524
Who is this?

224
00:28:07,166 --> 00:28:10,044
An old friend.
Forgive me.

225
00:28:10,366 --> 00:28:11,477
Friend?

226
00:28:13,578 --> 00:28:16,278
Most of the people in the village
believe you're dead.

227
00:28:23,946 --> 00:28:27,485
My mother still lights a candle for you
in the spring.

228
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,305
Sometimes hard things
must be done, Gaelen.

229
00:28:30,306 --> 00:28:32,277
Leaving is easy.

230
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:34,778
It's the staying behind...

231
00:28:36,326 --> 00:28:37,474
that's hard.

232
00:28:40,926 --> 00:28:42,165
We had a life.

233
00:28:42,566 --> 00:28:46,366
A life... standing in line
to pay tithes to the Tower.

234
00:28:47,446 --> 00:28:52,382
A life... staring at the ground
in fear when an orc walks by!

235
00:28:52,487 --> 00:28:54,298
This is the life you want?

236
00:28:54,847 --> 00:28:56,263
It is what we have.

237
00:28:56,967 --> 00:28:59,420
Gaelen, why did you follow me
this time?

238
00:29:00,987 --> 00:29:03,918
Why couldn't you have followed me
last time when I needed you to?

239
00:29:04,047 --> 00:29:07,266
My parents helped raise you as a child,
would you have me abandon them?

240
00:29:07,267 --> 00:29:11,037
For months I lay sleepless
wishing you had come with me.

241
00:29:12,447 --> 00:29:13,984
I still wish that.

242
00:29:17,867 --> 00:29:19,201
I still can't.

243
00:30:24,129 --> 00:30:27,808
I bring you the town mayor, Your Grace.
And the master builder.

244
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:32,506
Welcome to Blackweir, Your Grace.

245
00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:38,577
Lesher Noga, at your service.

246
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:13,667
Enjoing the view, Crawlis?
Thinking of... flying away?

247
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,319
Is she here?

248
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,361
She's with the Legate.

249
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,366
It is true, then.

250
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:28,668
The long arm of the Tower reaches
in to Lesher's little nest once more.

251
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:34,664
I wonder if it knows of the...
vipers that live in her walls.

252
00:31:40,191 --> 00:31:42,903
How could you afford a book,
anyway?

253
00:31:44,851 --> 00:31:47,543
Some things are not bought.

254
00:31:47,811 --> 00:31:51,064
If the Legate saw such contraband
it would be the death of us.

255
00:31:51,251 --> 00:31:53,350
What do you want, Magistrate?

256
00:31:53,351 --> 00:31:55,742
You could start
by telling me how an assassin...

257
00:31:55,743 --> 00:31:58,143
comes to know
the forbidden craft of letters.

258
00:31:58,631 --> 00:32:00,303
Lesher teach you?

259
00:32:00,471 --> 00:32:02,466
- Careful.
- Is that a threat, Crawlis?

260
00:32:02,771 --> 00:32:03,845
Yes.

261
00:32:03,911 --> 00:32:07,587
The Shadow will gain
foothold here, Crawlis. It's inevitable.

262
00:32:08,031 --> 00:32:11,103
You think that Lesher will remain
in Blackweir when that happens?

263
00:32:11,171 --> 00:32:14,210
You seem to have such firm grasp
of the future.

264
00:32:14,211 --> 00:32:16,725
The wind changes, Crawlis.

265
00:32:17,211 --> 00:32:20,365
You may want to...
reconsider your allegiances.

266
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:23,466
when that book of yours
is burned.

267
00:32:24,292 --> 00:32:25,747
And you with it.

268
00:32:32,312 --> 00:32:35,168
Let's not mention the word "book"
to the Legate.

269
00:32:53,632 --> 00:32:55,585
What sort of Legate is he?

270
00:32:57,952 --> 00:33:02,806
There are many Legate orders...
but I never seen such as him.

271
00:33:03,632 --> 00:33:09,224
I could've bathed in your cowardice
back there. You reek of fear.

272
00:33:09,313 --> 00:33:13,625
As should you... Soon enough
they willl know what we have done.

273
00:33:13,693 --> 00:33:19,443
The stories of Blackweir, Dolan...
are not merely ghost stories.

274
00:33:19,444 --> 00:33:21,744
told to children by firelight.

275
00:33:21,993 --> 00:33:23,265
I know.

276
00:33:23,453 --> 00:33:26,866
Then hold your tonge.
Be patient.

277
00:33:28,167 --> 00:33:29,567
As with the others...

278
00:33:30,853 --> 00:33:34,473
our new guests
will meet their fate here.

279
00:33:45,193 --> 00:33:48,828
Those two seem to have prospered
in the absence of a Shadow church.

280
00:33:50,354 --> 00:33:51,984
Yet their town has not.

281
00:33:52,794 --> 00:33:59,088
This local legend they spoke of.
The outlaw the call the "Hunter".

282
00:34:01,034 --> 00:34:02,090
Is he importand?

283
00:34:03,454 --> 00:34:04,751
Perhaps.

284
00:34:12,074 --> 00:34:14,684
There's smoke rising on the Greenroad.

285
00:34:16,674 --> 00:34:19,532
I may assume
they received our information?

286
00:34:19,734 --> 00:34:20,986
As always.

287
00:34:22,254 --> 00:34:26,870
And still, they exhibit no concern
regarding it's source?

288
00:34:28,754 --> 00:34:33,807
They never ask...
They trust me, Lesher.

289
00:34:35,015 --> 00:34:36,465
Simpletons.

290
00:34:39,155 --> 00:34:41,367
But still, why should they not?

291
00:34:42,795 --> 00:34:47,225
The wagons I've placed before them,
could've fed a small army.

292
00:34:47,795 --> 00:34:50,732
Indeed, that's just they've done.

293
00:34:52,155 --> 00:34:54,311
You, uh... met with the new Legate?

294
00:34:54,375 --> 00:34:55,849
Thats none of your concern.

295
00:34:56,095 --> 00:34:58,345
How can I not be concerned, Lesher?

296
00:34:58,595 --> 00:35:01,767
A representative of the Tower
is hardly a trifling matter.

297
00:35:01,915 --> 00:35:06,308
If your so eager for something
to occupy your mind...

298
00:35:06,475 --> 00:35:10,807
set yourself to moving the last
of the goods to my holdings in Eisin.

299
00:35:11,155 --> 00:35:16,192
Prepare for the journey quickly
and need I say... with stealth.

300
00:35:16,616 --> 00:35:19,710
It's hardly necessary
that I undertake this myself.

301
00:35:19,776 --> 00:35:20,927
- The orcs...
- It's necessary...

302
00:35:20,928 --> 00:35:23,828
if you are still interested
in receiving your tenth.

303
00:35:26,836 --> 00:35:28,031
Now leave me!

304
00:35:39,176 --> 00:35:40,609
I did it for my family.

305
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:42,810
What I did here.

306
00:35:43,411 --> 00:35:44,511
I did it for them.

307
00:35:47,236 --> 00:35:49,230
If you're speaking of missing tithes,

308
00:35:49,876 --> 00:35:53,132
or the fact that only you knew
the details of the supply caravans.

309
00:35:54,196 --> 00:35:56,327
I'm afraid you've already been found out.

310
00:35:56,337 --> 00:36:01,388
I will pay for my crimes.
But there is something I can offer you.

311
00:36:01,837 --> 00:36:04,570
In exchange for the safety of my family.

312
00:36:04,577 --> 00:36:09,912
The families of traitors...
are sent to Steel hill.

313
00:36:10,437 --> 00:36:11,948
This is a death sentence.

314
00:36:12,257 --> 00:36:16,555
When no work remains in them...
they will die.

315
00:36:16,837 --> 00:36:20,755
There is something
that you need to know... A secret!

316
00:36:21,756 --> 00:36:23,056
You shall have it...

317
00:36:23,197 --> 00:36:26,468
if you show mercy to my family.

318
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:29,933
And why should your secret
be worth... such a price?

319
00:36:30,217 --> 00:36:33,771
Because...
you're in danger here.

320
00:36:41,598 --> 00:36:45,134
Might I hazard that the meeting
with the Legate did not go well?

321
00:36:45,258 --> 00:36:51,506
He ordered me to round up the townsfolk,
to help Dolan finish that temple.

322
00:36:53,598 --> 00:36:56,271
Told me to work them to death
if necessary.

323
00:36:56,298 --> 00:36:58,771
The dead are not so good
about paying taxes.

324
00:37:01,078 --> 00:37:03,807
This Legate, Mag Kiln...

325
00:37:05,808 --> 00:37:08,808
has a different look
from those who come before.

326
00:37:10,358 --> 00:37:17,489
He asks questions...
about the others... about the past.

327
00:37:21,498 --> 00:37:25,194
The builder said
he was... no ordinary priest.

328
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:28,409
Regardless of what he is
he won't last long here.

329
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:30,609
None have.

330
00:37:30,859 --> 00:37:32,755
Like the ones that came before.

331
00:37:34,556 --> 00:37:37,456
This town will devour him.

332
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:34,349
Quality craft...
Elven make.

333
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:39,731
I know the look of Elven arrows...
What else?

334
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:46,176
Well... location like this here...
lovely little spot for an ambush.

335
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,690
These outlaws,
they must've known they were coming.

336
00:38:49,321 --> 00:38:53,191
He was here...
I can smell him.

337
00:38:54,241 --> 00:38:56,360
I believe that'd be roast orc.

338
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:02,353
While this Legate remains,

339
00:39:02,921 --> 00:39:06,236
We must cease our more
delicate dealings,

340
00:39:07,161 --> 00:39:12,793
grovel... and pledge
our undying loyalty...

341
00:39:13,294 --> 00:39:14,494
to the Tower.

342
00:39:14,861 --> 00:39:17,200
At least your groveling
is already accomplished.

343
00:39:17,601 --> 00:39:23,558
Don't mock me, Crowlis.
Only one thing concerns me:

344
00:39:24,641 --> 00:39:29,220
A weak link in our chain of devotion
to the Tower.

345
00:39:35,202 --> 00:39:37,215
- An Elven knife?
- Of course!

346
00:39:37,902 --> 00:39:42,001
Everyone knows that the Hunter
is supplied by the elves.

347
00:39:42,102 --> 00:39:48,750
And he's a murderous roque...
capable of the most heinous deeds.

348
00:39:55,622 --> 00:39:59,654
The best thing now...
maybe head back townwards

349
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:03,001
See if anyone knows
anything about this "Hunter".

350
00:40:03,002 --> 00:40:07,296
Seems to me... I recall some loose talk
back at the tavern about...

351
00:40:08,082 --> 00:40:09,659
Now where you going?

352
00:40:12,102 --> 00:40:14,119
That isn't the way to the tavern.

353
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:33,331
Good work, Gaelen.

354
00:40:36,463 --> 00:40:40,422
Can't recall how many times
I've had to hang up this shield.

355
00:40:42,443 --> 00:40:45,613
How many times must you fall?

356
00:41:04,824 --> 00:41:07,141
What is it, Gaelen?
A girl?

357
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,802
It's nothing.

358
00:41:10,344 --> 00:41:13,094
And Izador's a sugar beet.

359
00:41:15,695 --> 00:41:17,095
Did you pay our tithe?

360
00:41:17,104 --> 00:41:18,153
I did.

361
00:41:18,264 --> 00:41:19,333
And?

362
00:41:19,584 --> 00:41:25,920
Pa, in the hanging square
in Blackwear... I saw Liana.

363
00:41:28,364 --> 00:41:30,922
- They hung her?
- No, no no, I saw her in the crowd.

364
00:41:36,504 --> 00:41:38,035
Knew it was a girl.

365
00:41:40,245 --> 00:41:44,397
So, our little Liana
comes back again.

366
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:49,995
I always liked her.
Spine and lip, leathal concoction.

367
00:41:50,005 --> 00:41:51,682
She's joined the Hunter.

368
00:41:57,365 --> 00:42:00,343
I'm glad to hear it, Gaelen
Morrec's a good man.

369
00:42:00,405 --> 00:42:01,704
It doesn't matter!

370
00:42:01,905 --> 00:42:04,224
Morrec needs good men.

371
00:42:04,225 --> 00:42:09,121
You're a good man, son.
You got the blood of Erenland in you.

372
00:42:09,145 --> 00:42:12,364
- Strong.
- So I shoud just leave, huh?

373
00:42:12,645 --> 00:42:14,881
Leave a blind man
to take care of a farm?

374
00:42:26,486 --> 00:42:28,639
You'll starve before the chickens, Pa.

375
00:42:29,006 --> 00:42:32,723
The Shadow took my eyes, Gaelen,
not my heart.

376
00:42:33,406 --> 00:42:36,204
Don't accept him.
That what he wants.

377
00:42:36,286 --> 00:42:38,441
- What he needs.
- And how would you know that?

378
00:42:38,526 --> 00:42:42,123
I know that you don't wanna stay here
to rot with us!

379
00:42:43,006 --> 00:42:46,784
That you believe
that the day will come again.

380
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:51,316
Say it!

381
00:42:57,166 --> 00:42:58,680
The day will come again.

382
00:43:02,226 --> 00:43:03,636
See that it does.

383
00:43:24,827 --> 00:43:26,018
What is it?

384
00:43:29,287 --> 00:43:30,626
I don't know.

385
00:43:32,727 --> 00:43:35,627
Powerful magic
was once wrought in this place.

386
00:43:36,767 --> 00:43:37,677
Here.

387
00:43:38,878 --> 00:43:41,078
This script seems to be repeated.

388
00:43:42,567 --> 00:43:43,783
What does it say?

389
00:44:09,968 --> 00:44:11,377
This is the only way?

390
00:44:20,288 --> 00:44:21,358
You go first.

391
00:44:58,009 --> 00:45:03,284
A few years ago... I came down here
to check the temple foundations.

392
00:45:08,529 --> 00:45:11,843
And that...
is when I found this.

393
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:36,562
Have you ever wondered,
why this temple was never complete...

394
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:38,404
even after a hundred years?

395
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:44,402
Corrupt fools such as you
never hastened it's consecration.

396
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:48,743
The Legate Order is everywhere.
Why not here in Blackweir?

397
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:51,565
Why indeed.

398
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:59,270
I never told anyone about this place.
I never dared.

399
00:47:16,412 --> 00:47:17,607
Legates!

400
00:47:33,413 --> 00:47:36,708
Dolan. Dolan, what is this?

401
00:48:15,094 --> 00:48:19,113
You rush us here with holy haunches
on fire, and you won't tell me why?

402
00:48:19,114 --> 00:48:21,505
I told you. Chuzara's in danger.

403
00:48:22,174 --> 00:48:24,210
Your broken stone told you this?

404
00:48:24,214 --> 00:48:25,653
Lord's Legate!

405
00:48:26,914 --> 00:48:29,882
Why, your stone was right, Mag.

406
00:48:30,094 --> 00:48:32,508
Chuzara's been eaten by a pirate.

407
00:48:33,054 --> 00:48:34,072
Who are you?

408
00:48:35,074 --> 00:48:37,149
I'm the town's magistrate,
Your Grace.

409
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:39,308
Know that Blackweir has hungered...

410
00:48:39,309 --> 00:48:41,409
- for the Shadows return...
- Spare me.

411
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:47,214
I only wish to make my humble services
available to Your Grace.

412
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:49,470
I have no time for your services,
Magistrate.

413
00:48:50,375 --> 00:48:53,452
Your Grace I...
Your Grace, I come with information!

414
00:48:53,455 --> 00:48:55,407
I know of crimes against the Tower!

415
00:48:57,015 --> 00:48:59,987
Find Chuzara.
Be careful.

416
00:49:00,495 --> 00:49:02,047
I'll find her.

417
00:49:05,675 --> 00:49:08,253
Convinced me
you're not wasting time.

418
00:49:08,495 --> 00:49:11,985
Blackweir's been enthralled
to Mayor Lesher for almost a decade.

419
00:49:12,535 --> 00:49:15,666
You should know that she's been skimming
the temple tithes for years.

420
00:49:15,715 --> 00:49:18,304
And you think a Legate
would not know this?

421
00:49:18,395 --> 00:49:23,266
But there is more! She's been purposely
delaying the construction of this temple,

422
00:49:23,415 --> 00:49:26,990
biding herself more time to steal.
She's insidious.

423
00:49:26,995 --> 00:49:31,050
Don't lie, Magistrate.

424
00:49:31,776 --> 00:49:36,048
The delay are caused by rogue attacks
on temple supplies.

425
00:49:36,049 --> 00:49:37,349
I know this.

426
00:49:37,916 --> 00:49:40,655
She forces the builder to tell her
of those caravans.

427
00:49:40,656 --> 00:49:43,172
Then she brings word to the Hunters.

428
00:49:43,256 --> 00:49:45,048
Lesher knows the Hunter?

429
00:49:45,256 --> 00:49:47,928
She uses one of my men
as an informent.

430
00:49:48,636 --> 00:49:51,394
I don't believe the Hunter
knows the true source.

431
00:49:51,436 --> 00:49:53,486
That Lesher's using him.

432
00:49:53,936 --> 00:49:56,691
Lesher is not as clever
as you give her credit for.

433
00:49:56,696 --> 00:49:58,748
I'm sure I don't understand.

434
00:49:58,796 --> 00:50:02,975
Suffice to know the Tower
has keen interest in finding this man.

435
00:50:02,996 --> 00:50:05,810
Then let me help you find him!

436
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:11,166
I'm afraid growing another eye
is beyond my powers, Magistrate.

437
00:50:11,856 --> 00:50:17,111
When you've finished with Lesher,
Blackweir will need a mayor.

438
00:50:17,497 --> 00:50:19,352
One loyal to the Tower.

439
00:50:40,297 --> 00:50:42,536
Going for a nice threesome?

440
00:50:45,757 --> 00:50:47,090
Who inquires?

441
00:50:47,357 --> 00:50:50,656
Sword of Theros Obsidia.
High Legate Order.

442
00:50:50,717 --> 00:50:53,248
Shadow in the north,
so on and so forth.

443
00:50:53,437 --> 00:50:56,694
Well, if it isn't the Legate's
little servant.

444
00:50:57,438 --> 00:51:02,448
I'm surprised you're not at the tavern,
imbiding every wet thing about.

445
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:05,412
Yes, my bones ache for it.

446
00:51:05,518 --> 00:51:10,117
But you see, the guy in black
breathes duty down my neck.

447
00:51:10,158 --> 00:51:11,172
Horrible thing.

448
00:51:12,073 --> 00:51:13,873
Especially after he's had onion.

449
00:51:14,758 --> 00:51:16,689
So sad for you.

450
00:51:16,798 --> 00:51:20,010
What'd you say... a trip to the temple?
Meet the Legate?

451
00:51:22,378 --> 00:51:24,448
I'm afraid it's too late to play.

452
00:51:24,538 --> 00:51:29,095
Now, now, now, it's clear
you 3 can't wait to cut up together.

453
00:51:29,238 --> 00:51:32,892
But, I'm afraid
the Legate wants to see you.

454
00:51:37,318 --> 00:51:38,510
Now.

455
00:51:39,659 --> 00:51:41,434
Mayor Lesher will hear of this.

456
00:51:43,338 --> 00:51:44,438
Hm...

457
00:51:44,839 --> 00:51:46,614
indeed she will.

458
00:52:05,019 --> 00:52:09,557
Who's there?
Crawlis?

459
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,319
He's lying!

460
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,539
Remarkable!

461
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:28,415
Only a profound judge of character
could penetrate my cunning duplicity.

462
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,870
Shut your noise hole, weasel.

463
00:52:29,871 --> 00:52:31,471
And so eloquent!

464
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:38,018
A lost child of the Elthedar for sure,
yet so hideous a visage.

465
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:39,855
- You're dead... Shadow whore!
- Wait!

466
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,113
Here I thought
it was too late to play.

467
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:18,656
Your friend isn't sticking around
for a last swig, I suppose?

468
00:53:31,161 --> 00:53:33,029
No? No?!

469
00:53:33,741 --> 00:53:34,920
Alright then.

470
00:53:52,202 --> 00:53:53,532
What do you want?

471
00:53:54,722 --> 00:53:56,738
Well, let's see.

472
00:53:57,022 --> 00:54:01,315
To never again smell another
god-forsaken backwater hamlet.

473
00:54:01,482 --> 00:54:05,031
To suckle on woman, wine,
and a greasy boar...

474
00:54:05,032 --> 00:54:06,721
until my knots give up their ghost.

475
00:54:06,722 --> 00:54:09,755
- Preferably somewhere warm...
- What does the Legate want?

476
00:54:11,382 --> 00:54:13,576
Who am I to know
the mind of a Legate?

477
00:54:14,262 --> 00:54:17,537
So, you're gonna come along willingly,
or a body shorter?

478
00:54:17,742 --> 00:54:20,596
Lesher will hang your entrails
from the town walls!

479
00:54:21,342 --> 00:54:23,856
Well it's understandable
she would want to, uh...

480
00:54:23,962 --> 00:54:26,637
showcase the size of my manhood.

481
00:54:27,022 --> 00:54:30,015
And my question?

482
00:54:31,463 --> 00:54:32,919
Willingly.

483
00:54:36,623 --> 00:54:37,879
Good choice.

484
00:54:49,983 --> 00:54:51,897
The air is heavy tonight.

485
00:54:57,183 --> 00:54:59,772
Something stirs.

486
00:55:12,824 --> 00:55:20,459
I renounce you!
I purge myself... of you!

487
00:55:30,484 --> 00:55:34,377
Why are you here?
Leave me.

488
00:55:35,584 --> 00:55:39,723
No more words.
I must do this alone.

489
00:55:58,665 --> 00:56:02,378
I was told that your kind
vanished from this land long ago.

490
00:56:02,845 --> 00:56:05,175
We do not perish so easily.

491
00:56:05,405 --> 00:56:08,502
You killed them.
The others.

492
00:56:09,585 --> 00:56:11,540
They still haunt this place.

493
00:56:11,605 --> 00:56:14,417
And you shall join them, Legate.

494
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:16,377
In that.

495
00:56:17,245 --> 00:56:18,480
You are to late.

496
00:56:19,481 --> 00:56:26,081
Kill me if you must!
But you kill a free man, not a Legate.

497
00:56:26,385 --> 00:56:28,859
The old man insisted
he could turn you.

498
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:31,260
Live then.

499
00:56:32,825 --> 00:56:35,478
Wait!
They will hunt me.

500
00:56:35,685 --> 00:56:38,523
Yes, he does not forgive.

501
00:56:39,086 --> 00:56:40,981
They will know me by this.

502
00:56:41,086 --> 00:56:43,920
A tarnish
that can never be washed away.

503
00:56:44,506 --> 00:56:45,995
Perhaps, not washed.

504
00:56:46,146 --> 00:56:50,118
Ah, I can not tear the Shadow
from your soul.

505
00:56:50,386 --> 00:56:55,460
No. Toward that end,
I will devote the rest of my life.

506
00:57:13,486 --> 00:57:15,503
You looked inward?

507
00:57:17,026 --> 00:57:18,656
We call it dreaming.

508
00:57:21,847 --> 00:57:23,983
Seems unpleasant.

509
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:25,477
Sometimes.

510
00:57:34,507 --> 00:57:35,757
You well?

511
00:57:55,747 --> 00:57:57,920
What brings you from Blackweir, Doucan?

512
00:57:58,667 --> 00:58:03,498
- Has your beer run dry?
- The customers have run dry, Hunter.

513
00:58:03,627 --> 00:58:05,086
What's happened?

514
00:58:05,168 --> 00:58:11,703
The Legate... He's arrested Lesher,
and he's begun hanging the townsfolk.

515
00:58:12,628 --> 00:58:13,659
What?

516
00:58:14,428 --> 00:58:16,062
I thought you should know.

517
00:58:29,728 --> 00:58:34,897
Wherever the Legates go,
the gallows are well fed.

518
00:58:35,648 --> 00:58:37,337
It's me he's after.

519
00:59:06,329 --> 00:59:09,227
Search everyone
who enters or leaves this town.

520
00:59:09,309 --> 00:59:10,345
Of course.

521
00:59:17,549 --> 00:59:21,522
Hang three every hour,
until the Hunter is delivered to me.

522
00:59:24,149 --> 00:59:26,603
You think me unjust?

523
00:59:28,304 --> 00:59:32,504
On the contrary...
I am merciful.

524
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:38,121
Dornish cities have been razed
to the ground for lesser crimes.

525
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:42,789
When I am mayor,
I can assure you that Blackweir...

526
00:59:42,790 --> 00:59:47,183
will be unrivaled in it's loyalty
to the Tower, Your Grace.

527
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:50,261
You have made a wise choice.

528
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:08,579
An Elven knife.
Clever ruse.

529
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:10,002
Clever, Your Grace?

530
01:00:11,703 --> 01:00:14,510
But the outlaws
are supplied by the elves.

531
01:00:14,511 --> 01:00:18,670
I grow weary of your lies, Lesher.

532
01:00:19,691 --> 01:00:25,090
This town... must have seemed
a ripe plum, waiting to be picked.

533
01:00:25,971 --> 01:00:30,186
No church...
no Legate to answer to.

534
01:00:30,687 --> 01:00:36,087
A murderous wretch from the streets
of Eisen, could rise far in such a place.

535
01:00:36,931 --> 01:00:42,463
- Even to the office of mayor.
- Spare my life, Your Grace.

536
01:00:43,691 --> 01:00:45,721
I can be of use to you...

537
01:00:46,511 --> 01:00:48,081
Perhaps you can.

538
01:00:49,051 --> 01:00:53,139
Towns like these,
attract the worst sorts.

539
01:00:53,351 --> 01:00:55,764
Idealists and rogues both.

540
01:00:56,832 --> 01:01:01,351
But there is...
a darker secret here,

541
01:01:01,652 --> 01:01:02,852
is there not?

542
01:01:03,632 --> 01:01:07,906
Something only a cunning rat like you
must've felt.

543
01:01:08,152 --> 01:01:10,349
I'm sure, I... don't know.

544
01:01:10,432 --> 01:01:12,706
- Then you are no use to me.
- No! Wait!

545
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:26,388
Tell me about the dead Legates.

546
01:01:26,612 --> 01:01:29,051
Tell me what Dolan knew!

547
01:01:30,292 --> 01:01:38,286
I only know tales... Ghost stories,
told by the small folk.

548
01:01:57,073 --> 01:01:59,003
I welcome you into this dark.

549
01:01:59,053 --> 01:02:01,613
By Your Grace,
I walk under His Shadow.

550
01:02:04,313 --> 01:02:06,688
You have travelled with speed,
old friend.

551
01:02:06,733 --> 01:02:10,821
The Ones Who Watch, gave news
of your coming only a fortnight ago.

552
01:02:11,233 --> 01:02:14,027
Yet, they did not give word
of your purpose.

553
01:02:14,073 --> 01:02:18,052
Raynn, Sanulael's church
may be nearing it's end.

554
01:02:18,873 --> 01:02:23,564
Speak softly! The allies
of First Legate are everywhere.

555
01:02:26,354 --> 01:02:28,470
You've heard of this new prophecy?

556
01:02:28,614 --> 01:02:32,887
The northern devout fear it forebodes
the rise of a great enemy.

557
01:02:32,954 --> 01:02:35,968
I believe it also foretells the return
of the one we've awaited.

558
01:02:37,274 --> 01:02:38,505
How can that be?

559
01:02:39,174 --> 01:02:43,664
The ritual... Except for our one failure,
are all dead.

560
01:02:43,694 --> 01:02:45,607
What if we did not fail?

561
01:02:47,254 --> 01:02:49,263
Does she still live?

562
01:02:49,874 --> 01:02:52,407
Her vigor surprises even me.

563
01:02:53,894 --> 01:02:57,386
Ah! I should've known
you came for her!

564
01:02:58,874 --> 01:03:03,065
But... it is good to see you
in Sharuun again, old friend.

565
01:03:06,375 --> 01:03:09,233
Let her stand there, until she
remembers something useful.

566
01:03:10,475 --> 01:03:13,069
Or until she puts
an end to it herself.

567
01:03:13,075 --> 01:03:15,990
- Will the Hunter come?
- They always come.

568
01:03:16,475 --> 01:03:20,566
What if... this outlaw
somehow captured Tosh?

569
01:03:21,235 --> 01:03:25,348
Outlaws capturing a Legate?
Unlikely.

570
01:03:27,775 --> 01:03:32,744
I wonder...
why so hopeful, Chuzara?

571
01:03:38,695 --> 01:03:41,707
Kruce said you found something
in the forest.

572
01:03:41,915 --> 01:03:43,909
Something which send you back
with speed.

573
01:03:44,775 --> 01:03:46,809
I worried for your safety.

574
01:03:48,296 --> 01:03:51,206
It was foolish
to follow the builder, Chuzara.

575
01:03:51,936 --> 01:03:54,810
- How did you know?
- Do you remember the temple ghosts?

576
01:03:54,836 --> 01:03:56,394
Do you remember their warning?

577
01:03:57,576 --> 01:03:59,706
In the forest
I found something unsettling.

578
01:03:59,956 --> 01:04:02,750
A ravaged monolith.
It seem to have been built...

579
01:04:02,751 --> 01:04:05,251
by Legates
during the first Shadow War.

580
01:04:05,756 --> 01:04:08,753
Ancient runes coverd it.
Runes of warning.

581
01:04:10,616 --> 01:04:12,791
I could only make out
one repeated word.

582
01:04:13,056 --> 01:04:14,075
Yes?

583
01:04:15,516 --> 01:04:16,986
The word was "prisoner".

584
01:04:50,217 --> 01:04:52,050
Do elves never sleep?

585
01:04:53,917 --> 01:05:00,656
Not in the way as humans.
We are children of both sun and stars.

586
01:05:00,657 --> 01:05:01,985
- Where's Morrec?
- Of course...

587
01:05:02,057 --> 01:05:04,748
- there is little of either in this place.
- Deleth!

588
01:05:07,057 --> 01:05:08,832
He left in the night.

589
01:05:10,257 --> 01:05:12,067
I thought you were his friend!

590
01:05:14,138 --> 01:05:17,251
- Friend?
- He's turning himself in, Deleth.

591
01:05:17,918 --> 01:05:19,372
To stop the hanging!

592
01:05:20,818 --> 01:05:22,388
He did not say that.

593
01:05:23,178 --> 01:05:28,769
Liana... don't be foolish.
You do not know Morrec's intentions.

594
01:05:29,278 --> 01:05:30,430
How can you know mine?

595
01:05:35,177 --> 01:05:36,277
What're you doing?

596
01:05:36,278 --> 01:05:39,957
I sense we are
traveling in the same direction.

597
01:05:51,578 --> 01:05:54,508
For a hundred years,
they came to this place.

598
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:56,711
To their doom.

599
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:06,652
Some power wards this door.

600
01:06:12,959 --> 01:06:17,889
What could have the strength...
to slaughter Legates like this?

601
01:06:18,439 --> 01:06:22,393
One that Legates sought to bind
in a monolith, long ago.

602
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:24,697
One that has yet
to show itself.

603
01:06:27,219 --> 01:06:31,449
I wonder what other secrets
lie beneath this town.

604
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:44,239
The First Watcher is resting.
She's not to be disturbed.

605
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:47,094
I have travelled from the Tower
to see her.

606
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:52,519
I know. Yet even the First Legate
has been turned away fom this sanctuary.

607
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,113
How long have you served her?

608
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:57,432
For five years
I have been her eyes.

609
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:00,975
Then I ask you to do something
for the first time in five years.

610
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,990
I ask you to interrupt
her rest.

611
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:21,794
Shai...
It's good to see you well.

612
01:07:24,341 --> 01:07:28,032
What shade of black
are you these days, Geddon?

613
01:07:28,341 --> 01:07:32,160
Why do you walk sleepless
on the battlements?

614
01:07:32,281 --> 01:07:35,856
The moonlight reminds you
of your brother perhaps?

615
01:07:36,001 --> 01:07:39,537
- A white stain on your night.
- What do you know of my brother?

616
01:07:43,221 --> 01:07:46,816
Not just a brother,
a twin brother!

617
01:07:47,081 --> 01:07:49,880
His memory
haunts your every reflection.

618
01:07:49,881 --> 01:07:52,536
He's dead.
Long ago, by my hand.

619
01:07:52,681 --> 01:07:55,819
When you have looked into his glass
long enough, Geddon.

620
01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:59,320
many unseen thing are laid bare.

621
01:07:59,941 --> 01:08:06,651
Hearts of men. Lies of men.
Lies men tell themselves.

622
01:08:07,202 --> 01:08:09,721
I came here for your council.

623
01:08:09,722 --> 01:08:11,233
Not to discuss my brother.

624
01:08:21,762 --> 01:08:26,711
One day the Tower will gain a foothold
in Blackweir, Grimnor. It is inevitable.

625
01:08:26,782 --> 01:08:28,532
Nothing is inevitable.

626
01:08:30,742 --> 01:08:32,734
You of all men know this.

627
01:08:35,482 --> 01:08:39,601
Yet it seems unlikely that this
young Legate will be reformed...

628
01:08:39,602 --> 01:08:42,355
by any whispers to his conscience.

629
01:08:44,442 --> 01:08:49,722
Morrec... after all these years,
you must suspect that there is something,

630
01:08:49,723 --> 01:08:56,022
in Blackwear I've pledged to protect,
something that the Tower cannot have.

631
01:08:57,003 --> 01:09:01,042
He sent a dream...
which drew me to this place.

632
01:09:03,283 --> 01:09:05,399
The Legates imprisoned him here...

633
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:09,100
in this rock.

634
01:09:09,863 --> 01:09:12,835
For two thousand years
he was trapped here.

635
01:09:13,063 --> 01:09:17,992
Since the Shadow fell, he has helped me
to hide that which must remain hidden.

636
01:09:18,443 --> 01:09:21,556
- Now his time has come again.
- Not only his.

637
01:09:22,543 --> 01:09:24,303
Blackweir has strong roots.

638
01:09:24,383 --> 01:09:26,856
The earth still remembers
a noble past.

639
01:09:28,523 --> 01:09:33,279
There is a place, a covenant place,
where the Shadow is weak.

640
01:09:33,844 --> 01:09:36,122
We will need your help.

641
01:09:47,384 --> 01:09:49,259
I'm going to Blackweir, Deleth.

642
01:09:49,884 --> 01:09:50,836
I know.

643
01:09:52,544 --> 01:09:55,416
And how is traveling with an elf
going to help me?

644
01:09:56,124 --> 01:09:59,902
The orcs receive double rations for every
pointed ear they nail to the town gates.

645
01:10:01,404 --> 01:10:03,759
It seems that folly
has found company.

646
01:10:08,004 --> 01:10:09,513
He would do the same for me.

647
01:10:10,644 --> 01:10:14,160
Yes, but he'd find another way.

648
01:10:14,525 --> 01:10:19,040
Getting killed won't help him...
Or avenge your family.

649
01:10:22,465 --> 01:10:23,557
He told you that?

650
01:10:24,165 --> 01:10:27,357
Hi did...
Though he need not have.

651
01:10:27,885 --> 01:10:30,758
It is plain that hard years
are among your few.

652
01:11:49,807 --> 01:11:52,523
Ven Haag found this manuscript
in an abandoned keep...

653
01:11:52,724 --> 01:11:55,424
in the mountains
north of the march.

654
01:11:56,007 --> 01:11:58,799
A youg girl once served there.

655
01:11:59,447 --> 01:12:03,301
In the winters the frost,
would cling thick to the walls.

656
01:12:03,807 --> 01:12:08,823
And she would press her hand into ice
until she could bear it no more.

657
01:12:09,527 --> 01:12:15,402
She could see her reflection there.
Ah, she was beautiful then.

658
01:12:16,487 --> 01:12:17,679
You?

659
01:12:17,807 --> 01:12:22,396
Before my watch...
Before his death.

660
01:12:24,328 --> 01:12:30,100
He would sit for hours,
not feeling the wind, looking south.

661
01:12:30,168 --> 01:12:33,140
Dreaming of a Legate order,
that would never be.

662
01:12:33,168 --> 01:12:36,644
It will be.
This says he will rise again!

663
01:12:37,088 --> 01:12:39,821
And that this shall be his mark.

664
01:12:45,508 --> 01:12:47,127
Bei Rial.

665
01:12:53,188 --> 01:12:55,560
You have to leave your bow
before we get to town.

666
01:12:56,588 --> 01:12:58,907
An elf never abandons his weapon.

667
01:12:59,228 --> 01:13:03,768
You'll have to make an exception...
It's too conspicuous.

668
01:13:04,469 --> 01:13:07,208
I think you underestimate
the guile of the elves.

669
01:13:07,529 --> 01:13:08,920
No, not that way.

670
01:13:10,929 --> 01:13:12,360
What was that?

671
01:13:13,069 --> 01:13:17,902
I was told never to go there...
That it's dangerous.

672
01:13:25,249 --> 01:13:27,504
This is a journey
meant for a dwarf.

673
01:13:39,449 --> 01:13:43,322
One shouldn't commune with the
dark powers on an empty stomach.

674
01:13:43,809 --> 01:13:45,349
Leave me, Kruce.

675
01:14:48,971 --> 01:14:50,239
What is this place?

676
01:15:14,452 --> 01:15:18,423
We will rise again.
Bei Rial.

677
01:16:15,893 --> 01:16:17,188
Deleth, dont!

678
01:16:19,073 --> 01:16:21,989
The elves have learned
never to hesitate their blade.

679
01:16:27,933 --> 01:16:29,870
Tell me the wisdom
of hesitating now?

680
01:16:30,853 --> 01:16:32,450
I came back for you.

681
01:16:32,613 --> 01:16:35,432
I'm here to rescue a man, Gaelen,
This is not a game.

682
01:16:35,433 --> 01:16:37,131
Would you still have me
come with you?

683
01:16:39,854 --> 01:16:41,412
Liana, we must go.

684
01:16:42,174 --> 01:16:44,324
You what?

685
01:16:44,694 --> 01:16:46,844
What is that?

686
01:16:52,254 --> 01:16:56,109
Elf.
Help, elf!

687
01:16:56,354 --> 01:16:59,452
Elf!
Elf!

688
01:17:06,914 --> 01:17:08,033
They're coming.

689
01:17:08,374 --> 01:17:10,693
- Give me your bow.
- An elf never abandons...

690
01:17:10,694 --> 01:17:12,447
- his weapon!
- Do as he ask, Deleth.

691
01:17:12,448 --> 01:17:14,448
He was trained by the same man as I.

692
01:17:18,074 --> 01:17:19,673
- Gaelen.
- Go.

693
01:18:38,716 --> 01:18:40,767
Why the pacing, Chuzara?

694
01:18:41,968 --> 01:18:43,468
Are you in heat?

695
01:18:45,476 --> 01:18:46,808
Too hot for me.

696
01:18:47,177 --> 01:18:49,486
You know, I prefer my women
less deadly.

697
01:18:50,037 --> 01:18:52,273
Or dead, more likely.

698
01:18:58,357 --> 01:18:59,527
Trouble?

699
01:19:06,237 --> 01:19:07,990
Care to guess, who that is?

700
01:19:34,558 --> 01:19:35,667
They'll kill him.

701
01:19:38,838 --> 01:19:40,447
There is another way.

702
01:19:43,748 --> 01:19:45,048
A better way.

703
01:20:45,459 --> 01:20:46,768
Chuzara.

704
01:20:48,379 --> 01:20:49,355
Tosh.

705
01:20:53,156 --> 01:20:55,656
When no word came,
I thought you've been killed by elves.

706
01:20:57,340 --> 01:21:01,889
But this is worse...
I'm here with Mag Kiln.

707
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:05,496
Geddon's butcher.

708
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:07,259
Why, Tosh?

709
01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:10,560
To turn pale...

710
01:21:11,461 --> 01:21:14,761
To renounce the Shadow,
is to forfeit your life.

711
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:16,968
Everything.

712
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:21,052
You were not alway so enthralled,
to the doctrine.

713
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:27,736
Or did you forget... our time was
quite strictly forbidden?

714
01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:33,435
How could you confuse the love-play
of two novices with this... heresy?

715
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,030
Cast aside that yoke, Chuzara!

716
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:40,451
It is a hard life without him,
but a true one.

717
01:21:40,901 --> 01:21:44,250
To choose between you...
and my god?

718
01:21:46,141 --> 01:21:48,733
If you think you can even tempt me,
this temptation, you are a fool.

719
01:21:48,801 --> 01:21:51,556
It is Izrador who pays you
for the fool, Chuzara.

720
01:21:51,561 --> 01:21:56,435
You and and all the others!
Or do you think the Shadow cares for you?

721
01:21:57,961 --> 01:22:01,579
You are dead to me...
Hunter.

722
01:22:03,601 --> 01:22:08,159
Even if so...
when I saw you there...

723
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:10,360
back in the courtyard...

724
01:22:12,081 --> 01:22:15,759
for a moment I wished,
he had chosen someone else.

725
01:22:17,661 --> 01:22:19,392
I would not hurt you now.

726
01:22:19,742 --> 01:22:21,312
Is that supposed to be a threat?

727
01:22:37,502 --> 01:22:38,635
Mag.

728
01:22:38,682 --> 01:22:41,494
I know. He's here.

729
01:23:06,723 --> 01:23:08,376
She's still alive.

730
01:23:12,577 --> 01:23:15,277
Stay with her.
Be on your guard

731
01:24:01,244 --> 01:24:02,516
Someting ails you?

732
01:24:02,584 --> 01:24:05,896
The northern stars
lie in the Shadow...

733
01:24:16,444 --> 01:24:19,361
The southern stars
must shine for them.

734
01:24:20,424 --> 01:24:21,780
Grimnathaleth.

735
01:24:25,324 --> 01:24:26,938
Come in, Lord Domosuuran.

736
01:24:31,505 --> 01:24:32,841
And you as well, Liana.

737
01:24:33,225 --> 01:24:35,141
This is a dire night to be about.

738
01:24:36,605 --> 01:24:37,621
Do I know you?

739
01:24:43,965 --> 01:24:45,560
A dire night indeed.

740
01:25:17,586 --> 01:25:21,000
The harbinger shall come
into the lair of the beast.

741
01:25:21,301 --> 01:25:25,101
And there he shall open himself
to the past.

742
01:25:40,746 --> 01:25:42,585
I knew you would come, Legate.

743
01:25:43,526 --> 01:25:49,358
Tosh Kamar!
Izrador reclaims you.

744
01:25:50,646 --> 01:25:52,696
Tosh Kamar is dead.

745
01:26:25,687 --> 01:26:27,237
You cannot win.

746
01:27:22,489 --> 01:27:25,164
You afraid of the farmer, frog-face?

747
01:28:35,710 --> 01:28:37,719
This charade ends now.

748
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:42,959
Grimnor was right.
You would follow me straight to your doom.

749
01:28:43,550 --> 01:28:47,863
Legate pride...
I knew it well.

750
01:29:03,291 --> 01:29:05,483
Legates bound you centuries ago.

751
01:29:06,251 --> 01:29:10,407
- How did you escape their prison?
- I was freed by your enemy.

752
01:29:22,411 --> 01:29:24,086
Dorosul!

753
01:29:24,711 --> 01:29:28,351
We were born from the same breath,
your master and I.

754
01:29:29,132 --> 01:29:32,588
He has little power over me
in this covenent place.

755
01:29:37,112 --> 01:29:41,647
And in the shadows of the Shadow,
he shall dance with the beast.

756
01:29:42,152 --> 01:29:48,700
And the will know him for what he is...
and for what he will become.

757
01:30:06,312 --> 01:30:09,567
Legates imprisoned him here,
in this rock.

758
01:30:09,632 --> 01:30:11,804
Ancient runes covered it,
runes of warning.

759
01:30:11,813 --> 01:30:15,622
Oh, he's far to wild and dangerous
to be allowed to take shape for long.

760
01:30:18,533 --> 01:30:22,527
What could have the strength,
to slaughter Legate like this?

761
01:30:24,733 --> 01:30:28,264
You've heard of this new prophecy?
I could only make out one repeated word.

762
01:30:28,273 --> 01:30:30,812
He would stand for hours.

763
01:30:30,813 --> 01:30:31,687
The word was "prisoner".

764
01:30:31,753 --> 01:30:34,292
Not feeling the wind,
looking south...

765
01:30:34,293 --> 01:30:37,111
Dreaming of a Legate order
that would never be.

766
01:30:42,093 --> 01:30:43,361
Who are you?

767
01:30:47,173 --> 01:30:48,441
Bei Rial.

768
01:31:29,794 --> 01:31:31,467
We shan't be long, Merriam.

769
01:31:36,615 --> 01:31:37,594
Lord Domosuuran.

770
01:31:38,155 --> 01:31:39,234
Liana.

771
01:31:50,535 --> 01:31:53,686
This sanctuary
will soon succumb to the north.

772
01:31:54,055 --> 01:31:55,134
Grimnathaleth...

773
01:31:55,415 --> 01:31:58,204
The guardian has been destroyed, Deleth.

774
01:32:01,295 --> 01:32:03,847
And those who walk twice,
shall gather on the land...

775
01:32:04,055 --> 01:32:07,234
like the locust swarms of Farodun.

776
01:32:07,475 --> 01:32:10,087
And that shall be a portent
to his return.

777
01:32:11,235 --> 01:32:14,805
If you're right, this first sign
will soon come to pass.

778
01:32:16,275 --> 01:32:17,350
Where now, Legate?

779
01:32:18,235 --> 01:32:21,048
To find this someone
who has never failed me.

780
01:32:23,956 --> 01:32:29,049
Only a... Night King would have the power
to destroy an Elder One.

781
01:32:30,516 --> 01:32:32,649
Not even a Night King
could have done this.

782
01:32:37,996 --> 01:32:43,593
- Grimnathaleth, who killed the guardian?
- This Legate. This Mag Kiln.

783
01:32:44,096 --> 01:32:47,415
Not even the entire Legate Coven
that imprisoned him...

784
01:32:47,416 --> 01:32:50,553
- could destroy him!
- How could single Legate?

785
01:32:53,536 --> 01:32:55,408
This is no ordinary Legate.

786
01:32:58,136 --> 01:33:03,934
He is the harbinger...
Then it has begun.

787
01:33:05,897 --> 01:33:08,028
You two enjoy speaking in riddles?

788
01:33:09,117 --> 01:33:12,412
You should know we're here to free
the Hunter, kind sir.

789
01:33:12,877 --> 01:33:14,212
He may be dead by now.

790
01:33:14,437 --> 01:33:15,775
Yes, of course Liana.

791
01:33:16,177 --> 01:33:20,729
If it eases your mind, I can tell you
that Morrec is not dead.

792
01:33:21,377 --> 01:33:22,388
Not yet.

793
01:33:29,677 --> 01:33:30,705
Who are you?

794
01:33:30,917 --> 01:33:32,514
You don't remember, do you?

795
01:33:33,417 --> 01:33:36,448
I remember...
a young girl...

796
01:33:37,237 --> 01:33:41,249
dirty, cold, running in the woods,
running from the...

797
01:33:41,577 --> 01:33:43,289
tragedy behind her.

798
01:33:44,017 --> 01:33:45,834
There was a man in the woods.

799
01:33:46,118 --> 01:33:47,770
He took you
to where there was food.

800
01:33:47,998 --> 01:33:49,634
Sourberries, I think.

801
01:33:50,698 --> 01:33:54,257
He held you until you...
were warm.

802
01:33:56,098 --> 01:33:57,275
It was you.

803
01:33:58,998 --> 01:34:01,337
You sang to me,
beneath a great tree.

804
01:34:02,338 --> 01:34:06,274
John Socar's tree.
And then you fell asleep.

805
01:34:06,918 --> 01:34:08,490
When I woke,
you were gone.

806
01:34:08,738 --> 01:34:11,033
But someone found you, yes?

807
01:34:11,278 --> 01:34:14,350
A very important person...
a boy.

808
01:34:15,838 --> 01:34:17,030
Gaelen.

809
01:34:28,879 --> 01:34:31,232
I left Gaelen above
with orcs.

810
01:34:31,379 --> 01:34:34,698
I doubt that his fate
is in the hands of mere orcs.

811
01:34:34,699 --> 01:34:38,997
Gaelen has a journey ahead of him,
that can't be missed, you see?

812
01:34:39,119 --> 01:34:41,469
Grimnathaleth.
Do you mean Liana friend is...

813
01:34:41,479 --> 01:34:44,277
All in good time, Lord Domosuuran.

814
01:34:49,659 --> 01:34:50,829
I've heard of books.

815
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:55,294
I thought such things were all destroyed
by the Shadow long ago.

816
01:34:55,519 --> 01:34:59,514
Most were... some good men and woman
saved what they could...

817
01:34:59,519 --> 01:35:03,089
brought them here and hid them
from our northern foes.

818
01:35:04,079 --> 01:35:05,776
They must be very valuable.

819
01:35:05,839 --> 01:35:10,836
Even a few of these books could buy
Blackweir and all that's in it, Liana.

820
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:15,650
This is a treasure, then!

821
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:17,609
More than a treasure.

822
01:35:27,180 --> 01:35:29,859
Here...
is the soul of a people...

823
01:35:32,260 --> 01:35:33,760
The knowledge of generations.

824
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:39,037
here it awaits...
for the day to come again.
