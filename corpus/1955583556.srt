1
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,870
A new technology has emerged .

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,670
A micro chip designed
by Company Avanti .

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,340
However, the chip
has the power to change the world .

4
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,780
Look at the fate of mankind , Mr. Turner .

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,540
Did I selected ?

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,550
We have to change plans.
Turner escaped with chip.

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,320
The world is in chaos .

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:38,520
Despair who need a savior.
I intend to rescue it .

9
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,990
Wake up, Chad .

10
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,230
We made it.

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,930
My people are waiting on the ground .

12
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,540
I will find you , Mr. Turner !

13
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:52,610
No matter where you run ,
I will find you .

14
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,800
Avanti will not stop chasing me .

15
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,780
I just know that many people , ...

16
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,490
... who want this chip .

17
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,760
We must go .

18
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,850
People are disappearing
offhand .

19
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,720
If that is the Rapture , ...

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,780
... then this chip has a new meaning .

21
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,980
And I will not let it
fall into the wrong hands .

22
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,520
I want you to bring it to chip .

In all regions , with police authority
asked people to stay at home , ...

46
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,110
... and follow all notices .

47
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,770
Thousands of people have lost
including business and wholesale stores .

48
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,960
A report on the internet
discussed in more detail on this issue .

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,770
In the current crisis situation ,
Avanti biochemical technology companies , ...

51
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:44,800
Research is problematic due to the company

53
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,880
Earlier this month , Avanti
patented a revolutionary new device , ...

54
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,780
... which will be featured at the G20 summit .

55
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,230
But now , it seems it
will remain a mystery .

56
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,960
Mr. Turk , your building is being evacuated .

57
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,990
Please go downstairs now.

58
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,570
Just heard the news about Avanti . /
I know .

59
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,900
Tragic . /
It was not surprising .

60
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:25,480
The tragedy is that financial facilities are attacked immature
why can fail with an unacceptable failure .

61
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:33,090
Tragedy is heard fragments chip that keeps
just disappear like at 30,000 feet , ...

but somehow managed to escape .

63
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,040
We try his best to decode
in order to track the device Avanti , ...

64
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,930
... but there is no assurance that we will be ready
timely .

65
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:51,780
The best choice and the only option
is the chip to track Turner.

66
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,560
We should put a
Such forces , ...

67
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,160
... in order to track the whereabouts of Turner
and lead , or whatever .

68
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:11,000
Be prepared to welcome this opportunity.
Or others who would use it .

69
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:15,000
If we fail to find a chip that
then it will all end , Philip .

00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,210
Do not make me kill you .

75
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,020
You're desperate .

76
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,890
I understand .

77
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,120
You're not alone .

78
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,800
There are millions of people like you who are very fearful
will carry over to where the next day .

79
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,800
Will you think of the proposal
to solve this problem , ...

80
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,930

What are you doing ? Shoot him . /
Please do not . / Shut up!

82

You're not a killer .

83
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,310
While he is a murderer .

84
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,990
The person who met with you
a few hours ago , ...

85
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,890
... convince yourself by giving weapons
as a test , ...

86
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,830
... to protect yourself against the dangers
anything that will happen to you.

87
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,920
But that sort of thing
does not work against you .

88
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,320
Believe me !

89
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,190
This man is a very dangerous man , ...

90
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,950
... while hiding behind a woman
innocent as a defense , ...

91
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,970

ie kill others for it .

What?

93
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,940
Then put a gun in your head
then get rid of you .

94
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,910
Is not that true ?

95
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,320
Max ?

96
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,880
He does not know me. /
I know you.

What do you see ? What are you doing ? ! /
Shut up !!

99

He mempermainkanmu . /

Before its too late .

103
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,000

Drop !!

108
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,420
Our goal against Mr. Turner , ...

109
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,730
... let me loose .

110
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,990
For now, I have to go to Berlin .

111
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,850
Bangkok , Thailand , 10 hours thereafter .

112
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,940
Do you have a plan?

113
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,890
We will live with your parents .

114
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,220
Waiting for your parents ? /
Possibility .

115
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,720
Wait , where are we going ?

116
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,070
Follow the course, you will see later .

117
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:56,800
You know that I could not stay
anywhere too long .

118
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,540
I do not know how long they
Stop after me .

119
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:05,650
Avanti will never stop chasing me .
Did you hear obsession Turk , ...

120
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:08,540
... The other name is Josep .

121
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,970
I know that a lot of people , ...

122
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,880
... who want this chip .

123
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,020
Yes, what ?

124
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,630
Is this a bad time ? /
Probably for the rest of the world.

125
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:28,540
But not me , I'm still here . /
Continue where Mr. Turner ?

126
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:33,130
We trace the trail while now . /
I do not pay to fail , Mr. Pike .

127
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,340
If Avanti regain the chip ,
you will not get paid .

128
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:41,120
Is that a threat? / I do not agree if
you thought it was a threat.

129
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,840
I am a person who likes action .

130
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:47,740
I estimate that the natural disaster
being attacked now , right?

131
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,550
What happened was not a natural disaster
I guarantee it .

132
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,950
God gave a call for each of us , ...

133
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,880
... one word to a possibility .

134
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:01,800
Vocation is to bring unity
that is not acceptable and this useless ...

135
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,820
... by linking this event
to the process of the chip .

136
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,340
Do you believe in God , yes ?

137
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,980
I believe the money .

138
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,000
Just let me continue .

139
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,270
We still have to keep moving , Mr. Turk .

140
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,210
Warren ?

141
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,950
The plan changed recently.

142
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,120
Avanti server system hacks
to find a way to access the chip seal .

143
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,430
Chip embedded in Turner is the only
how to find it.

144
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:41,890
Do it as soon as possible.
I want the best team that participated .

145
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,000
On this morning , the turmoil in Vatican City
has reached a critical signs , ...

146
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,680
... leaving thousands of people dead
and many injured .

147
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,650
Rumors about doomsday
has led to fears in the US .

148
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,090
Rumored that a strong influence seems
is because of the sound of the hottest issues of the Bible , ...

149
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,390
... where the whole city disappeared.

150
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:06,060
At the G20 meeting in Berlin ,
milyoner sang , Phillip Turk , ..

151
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:11,770
... expected to give an opening statement
which may be the history of our humanity.

152
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,860
Melisa O'clock , World Radio Network reported.

153
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,770
Where are we going ?

154
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,980
My parents went to the house of my brother , Jeremy
Every year , ...

155
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:30,810
... to bring him
since the day of his death .

156
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,880
Sorry.

157
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,230
So , ...

158
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:42,960
... you already realize that they may
not there , right?

159
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,800
Stop competing stupid
or I'll give you more of a punch .

160
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,620
We know that you are designing
chip for Avanti , Mr. Cooper .

161
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,590
Surely you can tell us
the existence of Chad Turner.

162
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,980
Wait here , I'll call you a Mr. Pike .

163
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,890
People you requested has arrived , sir. /
Keep an eye on him .

164
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,740
So as you know
that the target is Chad Turner.

165
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,920
Former US special forces.

166
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:34,970
Now already fitted , ...

167
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,750
... with a prototype biometric chip , ...

168
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,430
... developed by Avanti .

169
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,920
My last my efforts to get back
chip it failed because of a monk .

170
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,580
The possibility of the unexpected.

171
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,130
Mr. Turner is a dangerous man .

172
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,090
He trained like us.

173
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:49,030
He thinks like us .

174
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,000
This is not a joke.

175
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:54,540
There are 5 million dollar reward for
anyone who can bring him to me .

176
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,980
Alive .
Will be wasted if he dies .

177
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:01,900
I want you guys split up, with the leading PDA
and detector software .

178
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:04,630
In a few hours ,
access to the trail system chip will be online .

179
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,940
We will know exactly where Mr. Turner .

180
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,720
Have a question?

181
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:13,870
What are you doing here ?

182
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,880
Put him in there .

183
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,490
What we can ? /
I have not been able to hack into the system Avanti .

184
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,870
The main server is still off ,
until I could access the system, ...

185
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,960
... chip will not be able to find
Chad Turner location .

186
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:33,000
Listen, I need this chip .

187
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,770
Do what you got to do
to get a chip that, you understand !

188
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:39,340
You are sure to see them go ? /
Yes .

189
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,610
I just see them go .

190
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,530
Without seeing them enter the building .

191
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,120
And you do not think to call the police ?

192
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,090
I just lost my wife , ...

193
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,790
... and a 16 year old boy .

194
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,860
I do not want to bother
take care of 2 rats swarming in my building .

195
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,830
Which way did they go?

196
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,950
What is it ?

197
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,730
I was just thinking of my brother.

198
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,080
When I was 10 years old , ...

199
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:37,770
... my parents said that I
will have a younger brother.

200
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,590
During the process of birth , ...

201
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,810
... there are complications .

202
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,740
My mother died .

203
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,760
He left a beautiful angel .

204
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,490
Its name , ...

205
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,140
... is Mali .

206
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,460
We're more than just a brother .

207
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,540
He is my friend .

208
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,460
I was a teacher .

209
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,080
I was a refugee .

210
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,930
He is my hope.

211
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,930
She is everything to me .

212
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,410
Along the departure of my mother , ...

213
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,770
... My father began living apart .

214
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:25,570
He does not care about himself.
Even the princess .

215
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,980
He was lost.

216
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,520
He began to drink ( alcohol ) .

217
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,790
Gambling .

218
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:37,210
Fight constantly.

219
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,630
Then one day , ...

220
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,730
... he borrowed money .

221
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:47,980
So he decided to sell
Mali as part of a bet.

222
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,540
Utangpun addicts come .

223
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:54,810
Then take him away.

224
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,930
Mali !

225
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,840
Dao !

226
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,980
Dao !

227
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,980
Mali !

228
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,940
Mali !

229
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,940
Mali !

230
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,770
Mali !

231
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,950
Mali !

232
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,780
Mali !

233
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,750
Mali !

234
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:09,840
Mali !

235
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,970
I have been looking for him ever since.

236
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,280
Everything happened suddenly
Late yesterday evening , ...

237
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,070
... when most people are asleep , ...

238
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,860
... others disappeared .

239
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:06,950
It seems all the lost children, regardless of
discrimination based on race, gender or social class .

240
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,320
Be careful .

241
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:16,960
He said what ? /
Her daughter disappeared .

242
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,980
It is not yet able to age .

243
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,990
The basic idea is like this , ...

244
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:28,800
... children are blessed by God's love, ...

245
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,410
... because they are too young to choose
Christ in time so ...

246
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:34,340
... HE selecting their age.

247
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,450
I mean , what is this experience ?

248
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,110
It's the rapture ,
these people ...

249
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,620
... taken by God .
Likewise with children , ...

250
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:46,120
... because they do not have to choose
until they are able to age .

251
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,330
Listen, do not worry .

252
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,760
We will find it.

253
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,120
You do not understand .

254
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,030
I mean today ,
so many people have taken .

255
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,760
God knew what he had to do
to survive .

256
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,060
I thought he was in heaven , ...

257
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,990
... or in peace , ...

258
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,110
... or somewhere.

259
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:08,830
Okay , we'll go.

260
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,990
The family did not have a clue
any ...

261
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,890
... while their children disappeared .

262
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,750
Many argue that this is
acts of God !

263
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,540
Cynthia , World News Radio reported.

264
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,760
We should stay with our family .

265
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,030
What is our goal to serve in this place ?

266
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,820
I've seen enough .

267
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,900
Come on .

268
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,360
We went .

269
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,670
Do not have a go anywhere .

270
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,830
Sit down.

271
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,770
Why ?
What do you want us to do ?

272
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:42,740
I hope you serve them
who has chosen you to represent them .

273
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:43,740
I doubt it, ...

274
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:48,120
... those of you who choose to face
terrible crisis of panic , ...

275
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:51,320
... and give it to others .

276
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,680
How do we have here ?

277
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,670
Why men attacked ?

278
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,760
What is the plan of God as the
destroy the world and its contents ?

279
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,440
Is the name of prophecy?

280
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,730
Judgment Day ?

281
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,650
None of us want to bow down to his knees
then pray to heaven , ...

282
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,830
... begging for forgiveness .

283
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:19,350
Will HE gives us one last chance ?

284
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,910
If so , ...

285
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,910
... we have to engage more deeply .

286
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,940
We must change our way of life .

287
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:29,530
We must find a solution to curb
The middle of a chaotic world .

288
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,110
To bring harmony , ...

289
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,980
... and humanity , ...

290
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,990
... to the Humanitarian Community .

291
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:38,170
You can not stop the wrath of God .

292
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,730
Have you talked with God lately
this ?

293
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,540
What He tells you that all this
is the plan ? Or , ...

294
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:48,710
... have we ever be with the team
the consequences of anger with the only way ...

295
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,720
... is all this nonsense ?

296
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,990
How can all this
make sense anymore ?

297
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,980
By having different thoughts .

298
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:03,720
All religions in the world , all \" book of faith \" talks
on the day when God restores the kingdom.

299
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,960
Since my youth , ...

300
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,930
... I had a vision .

301
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,800
Will own destiny , on the day on which
I stand before you and share my vision .

302
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,520
A peace that will lead the world .

303
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:17,800
We are Muslim , Jewish , Christian
and all beliefs , ...

304
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:21,810
... can share and come with a purpose
and to agree here .

305
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,210
Defend our lives .

306
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,740
As a normal human .

307
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,880
At times like these, ...

308
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,980
... that became one of the world !

309
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,710
Under God .

310
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:36,350
For a long time we put forward
our personal desires about being better , ...

311
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,890
... How can I win ,
How I can be better than them ?

312
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,570
And look what happened to us?

313
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,010
Now is the time .

314
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,320
Now is our chance .

315
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:53,090
To make the \" I \" to \" we \" ,
to make \" them \" to \" us \" .

316
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,670
The answer to all our prayers
not located above the clouds .

317
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,880
But here .

318
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,860
How is Warren ?

319
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,890
Sir, what if we were the team's tactics , ...

320
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:15,190
... find that she wear a parachute Turner
to escape from the plane?

321
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:16,330
Where are they now ?

322
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:19,020
Necessarily the best measure that can
Their journey is within a 50 mile radius , sir.

323
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,440
It is quite large areas , Warren .

324
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:25,430
I know , sir. We're trying ,
we will find them .

I need some information .
Anything to bring us closer to Chad Turner , ...

00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,080
... until the tracking device back on.

327
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,020
And you know for sure.

328
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,890
Hey .

329
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,960
Hello ?

330
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:47,340
Hello ? /
What?

331
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,890
Do you have a name?

332
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,740
Warren .

333
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:00,030
Maybe I can help you, Warren .

334
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:04,870
How did you do it ? /
I know a few things.

335
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,990
Will not be easy for me to lie
in this kind of place .

336
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:11,680
Whatever you know , we'll find out . /
Maybe .

337
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:16,990
Probably not,
Turner may even disappear thereafter.

338
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:25,840
Why would you help me ? /
Because you could help me .

339
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:28,060
We will all die , man .

340
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,230
Sooner or later he's going to kill me .

341
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,450
And if you disappoint , ...

342
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:37,210
... he will kill you too .

343
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:39,680
Look around you , kid.

344
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:44,720
There are things that happen
that you can not even comprehend.

345
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,880
I can help .

346
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,120
Great opportunity .

347
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:20,980
I will continue to turn off the lights ,
I do not want around us suspicious .

348
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,650
Be careful .

349
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,210
And .

350
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,680
He's not here .

351
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:12,870
Maybe she contacted the embassy .

352
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,080
Chad .

353
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,440
What?

354
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:40,120
He usually pray together
in bed every night .

355
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,810

... it seems that all stores will hire
everyone who already has a sign .

465

And it is the best
for the future of the world.

466
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,760

Something like this

This is the old version , which is no
me smaller and biometrics .

I do not know what to do

... if only they had a good private ?

495
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:29,550
Dao , you're the good guy
who is not appointed by God .

496
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:32,860
By showing

You also should disappear , it worked .

Nobody
which could disappear from Joseph Pike .

509
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,960
Tell that to Chad Turner.

510
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,220

The same figure by the name of the girl afterwards. /
Let me see .

517
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:57,610
Why did your father have a photo

518
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,540
I know where .
Here is HP .

519

Are you sure ? /

I once took a chip from
a person to be tested on animals .

527
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:31,090
I've never met him, but , ...

528
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:33,210
... if he were doing the planting , ...

529
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:35,790
... he might be able to pull out
This chip without a kill .

530
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:38,850
There is a doctor in Bangkok .

531
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:45,830
He has not got a chip revenue program
development for Avanti , Dr. Siriwat .

532
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,900
And Chad , ...

533
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,710
... I have been looking for ways to
blocking and tracking chip , ...

534
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,750
... it is the best way
to find it.

535
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,210
What did he do to
These young girls ? / Serial number them .

536
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:01,080
They like that I had.

537
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,750
Like what? /
Number urutku .

538
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:09,980
Numbers associated with chipku . /
What does that mean ?

539
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:15,650
I think it means that he wants to test the chip
in animals such as these girls .

540
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:20,410
But you said you are
the results of the first successful transplant ?

541
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:21,990
Warren .

542
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:41,780
What you've found ? / Then texted her ,
because if he knows how to remove the device , ...

543
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,220
... we have to find it.

544
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:48,330
Well, I can not wait
here selama--

545
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:53,770
\" Just come in Palm Square
at 12 o'clock \" .

546
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,800
Palm Square ,
place, ...

547
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:58,000
... about 20 minutes from here .

548
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:01,640
Let us leave !

549
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,110
What?

550
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,110
This is Mali .

551
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:14,100
Your sister ?

552
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:15,580
Mr. Pike .

553
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:20,320
I just found
location of the phone on my father's name Chad Turner.

554
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:23,960
Currently being tracked .

555
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,110
Good grief .

556
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:32,110
Listen.
We will find it.

557
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:35,940
Follow in his footsteps ,
Give me the exact location .

558
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:38,560
Highlighting the triangle in position .

559

Can . He was in the area Wire House ,

00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:46,550
... to Dr. Arjan Sirawat .

561
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:50,540
Jackson , The Warren , they are
The territory Wire House , ...

562
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:55,980
... I 'm sending her address now ! /
Okay , I 'm there .

563
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,220
Jackson , already in the Iron House .

564
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:25,990
Jackson , what do you get?

565
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,630
I can not get anything here , please tell me ! /
Okay .

566
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:33,110
The length of message delivery,
the program in its proxy , maybe ...

567
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,630
Can , you can catch them
within a radius of about 6 blocks .

568
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:37,870
Alright, I 'll be right there .

569
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:50,040
See .

570
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:52,650
I think the meeting place
The table was overturned .

571
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:56,990
Looks like it's a trap .
Beware any time.

572
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,000
Be careful.

573
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,110
Okay .

574
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,320
Have you seen this man? /
No.

575
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,870
Friends .

576
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:23,890
Did you see this person
somewhere?

577
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,690
Dr. Siriwat ?

578
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:47,800
Dr. Siriwat ?

579
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:51,210
Excuse me !

580
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:05,980
Chad .

581
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:11,800

We were heading to the park now !

582
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:15,960
Excuse me !

583
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:26,210
I saw Turner .
I will catch it.

584
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:38,370
Are you okay ? /
Yeah, I'm fine .

585
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,990
Come on .

586
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:44,990
Come on .

587
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:56,300
Barry , Tash .

588
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:59,320
They were right in front of you .
Follow the signal up to the park .

589
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:01,780
Okay .

590
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,510
Over there, over there ,

Good grief !

592
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:56,830
Ask the driver, what he
work faster ?

593
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:01,320
The only way to make fast
is to pay it.

594
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:04,650
Chad ...

595
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,440
Yes , that's him !

596
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:12,650
Finally we got to the Server Avanti . /
How to spot the color red ?

597
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,850
There should be only one green dot
and it is Chad .

598
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:18,110
Red dot there
is the old version of the chip.

599
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,560
I do not know why it 's there. /
I do not care .

600
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:22,770
Where is it located? /
The River Road next to the floating market .

601
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,670
Send coordinate it to me.

602
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:48,820
Chad !

603
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:00,380
Hurry ! Hurry!

604
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:14,110
Come on .

605
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,960
Up fast!

606
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:39,990
Hey !

607
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:47,880
We are in the market and need help . /
Remain in situ . We 're almost there .

608
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:04,850
Hang in there .

609
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:42,900
My sister would say :
\" Trust me . \"

610
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:16,870
Come on .

611
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:34,920
You're very good at running Chad ,
but already ended .

612
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:37,760
I do not want to kill you .

613
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:42,960
Do not worry , mate,
You're not going to do it .

614
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:50,980
Street !

615
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:12,310
What? /
You've spent my patience .

616
00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:14,030
We are desperate.

617
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:18,690
I did not come this far just to
people like you who make me frustrated .

618
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:24,100
You should be fired , right? /
There will be no warning , Mr. Pike .

619
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:26,230
If you do not send Chad Turner
alive to me , ...

620
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:29,890
... all the things that are not fun
will befall you .

621
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:32,810
I promise.

622
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:39,020
The pain that you're feeling
in the arm today , ...

623
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:42,760
... burning
in body and mind , ...

624
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:48,210
... will soon membiasakanmu
and punish you forever .

625
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:51,760
Your lungs bleed mercy
but nobody will come .

626
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:55,490
You do not send me hold reason
The inexhaustible .

627
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:57,830
Do not insist , Mr. Pike .

628
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:03,110
I can be very violent .

629
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,110
So , what will we do?

630
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:22,650
Search and find something .

631
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:26,450
From the beginning of my father
has worked for a dangerous man .

632
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:27,980
Wherever you're hiding , ...

633
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:31,210
... you will remain secure
the ambush .

634
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:36,950
Only the family understood it .

635
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:38,710
That's perfect.

636
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,720
Do you think the doctor will be there ?

637
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:48,580
Kuberharap so . / But how can we trust him ?
I mean , maybe he's \" hands\" ./ Listen.

638
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:51,890
We must try .

639
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:59,450
One day after the events of the changing world ,
The wait continues for missing family .

640
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:02,320
Those who seek answers
have not found anything .

641
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:05,670
Just add public unrest
which has become widespread .

642
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:07,950
Reports of the press , ...

643
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:11,790
... has increased the pressure on
political affairs and religious leaders .

644
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:13,910
In a meeting this afternoon between nations , ...

645
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:17,080
... figure behind entrepreneurship , Phillyp
Turk , ...

646
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:20,780
... has become a unifying figure
at the time of the disaster today.

647
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:26,920
Philip Turk proposed identification system has been considered
in response to the turmoil that was going on.

648
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:30,900
Stay tuned unification of the nations of the world
and protect the citizens of other events .

649
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,780
Determination of human tracking system
has lost its voice , ...

650
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:38,650
... because the public demands
become the largest selection .

651
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:42,880
They will not stop our pursuit. /
What are you doing ?

652
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:46,820
Perhaps in this way can prevent supply
blood to the chip.

653
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:50,210
Hinder the tracking of the chip.

654
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:54,980
What ...

655
00:53:55,830 --> 00:53:58,990
It sucks .
Has disappeared.

656
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,430
Chip ? /
Yes .

657
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,090
I told you, he 's smart.

658
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:08,210
Your boss will not be happy .

659
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:12,550
I think we 're very much .

660
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,900
Are you okay ?

661
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:22,550
I'm fine .
Come on .

662
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:31,990
It looks like the chip begins to release toxins
through the network in my body .

663
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:34,990
Good grief .

664
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,980
I have to get
to the doctor now .

665
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:41,650
Let's go to a doctor !
Stand up .

666
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:43,970
Let Chad , hang on.

667
00:54:56,020 --> 00:55:00,650
Breather . Are you okay ? /
I'm fine .

668
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:03,760
I guess this is the place.

669
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:08,760
Make sure you always have weapons. /
Okay .

670
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:14,770
Dr. Siriwat !

671
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:18,810
Dr. Siriwat !

672
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:23,880
Dr. Siriwat ! /
Hey , hey , what are you doing ? Whoa .

673
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:32,850
Doctor . I'm Chad Turner.
You worked with my father.

674
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:37,090
He's got a chip in his body.
We have to move it.

675
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:39,890
The possibility exists that toxins are released .

676
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:42,090
You should have spoken of earlier.

677
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:45,890
Let's bring him in
before anyone sees .

678
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:53,990
Did she steal at Avanti ?

679
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:57,810
If that is so ,
then we would not be here .

680
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,540
How did you find me?

681
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:02,650
Keep track of the latest messages that you send .

682
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:05,870
I figured I'd met his father .

683
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:10,540
I often moved locations to
does anyone know where my existence .

684
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,990
His father ...

685
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,860
His father disappeared ?

686
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:22,900
Wait .

687
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:27,110
How can I bet
You will not kill him ?

688
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:30,760
No need .

689
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:34,880
He just needs a little faith .

690
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,110
Looks like you 're anxious .

691
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:43,950
You do not even see my face .

692
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:51,860
How do you know I 'm worried?

693
00:56:52,770 --> 00:56:56,540
Just beaten my face
some time ago .

694
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:00,930
Surely you 're anxious .

695
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:07,420
About Pike ?

696
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:23,650
God , Warren .

697
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:27,770
You must be worried about God .

698
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:33,980
I also like that . /
Start a live broadcast in 3 , 2 , 1 .

699
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:41,880
At the time of this terrible tragedy , we must be united ,
with one heart , one soul , ...

700
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:43,970

demand on the black market .

existence every time .
