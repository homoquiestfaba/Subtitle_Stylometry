1
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,378
Sarah.

2
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,211
Sarah.

3
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,335
Sarah.

4
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,223
Sarah.

5
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,780
Sarah.

6
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,251
Same dream.

7
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,543
There's smoke.

8
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:06,287
Someone takes her hand.
She's running.

9
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,496
The same man comes towards her.

10
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,553
Jay Prescott with some
cool morning sounds,

11
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,257
and enjoy it while you can...

12
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,157
because it's gonna be
an unreasonably hot one

13
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,639
later in the day in L.A.,
going up to 95 in the Valley,

14
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,306
92 in the Basin and upper to 70s

15
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,035
in Santa Monica and the beaches.
- Hello?

16
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,900
- And now, appropriately enough...
- Hello?

17
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:27,612
...here's Yvonne Murray
with "Burning up."

18
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:29,733
Hello?

19
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,570
Ms. Julius?

20
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:33,736
Sorry, wrong number.

21
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:37,994
Remember who the ninth circle of hell
is reserved for.

22
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,196
Hmm.

23
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,667
- Morning!
- Morning.

24
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,335
- So, what do you want for breakfast?
- I don't have time.

25
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,295
I got an early class.

26
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,681
Close-up.

27
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,053
His eye gleams
like volcanic lava.

28
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,181
Sarah stands transfixed

29
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,598
like a deer
in a car's headlights.

30
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:07,147
Sarah? Why did you
name your character Sarah?

31
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,232
I don't know.

32
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:12,318
- More dreams, huh?
- Yep.

33
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:15,324
I'm not getting any sleep,
but it's gonna make a great film.

34
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:19,487
I wonder if Orson Welles
dreamt "Citizen Kane" first.

35
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:40,925
We're in a huge cathedral with gargoyles
all over, mixed with religious icons.

36
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,603
Mm!

37
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,306
- Mark!
- Mm.

38
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,726
- I want you, Maggie, right now.
- Mark, I can't.

39
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,155
Come on,
let's go back to my place.

40
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,788
- I'm... I'm dying without you.
- Mark, this is the age of safe sex

41
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:55,236
and sex with you on any level
is not safe.

42
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,072
Come on, Maggie.
Why won't you give us a chance, huh?

43
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,908
I'm crazy about you, but I'm not
gonna let you shine me on forever.

44
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,744
I'm not, I'm just concentrating
on my script right now.

45
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,000
Yeah, right, the script.

46
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,423
Come on,
this is really important to me.

47
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,382
I just can't let anything distract me.

48
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:11,672
Okay.

49
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,165
Okay, I see.

50
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,046
I just hope I'm still around
when you decide to get distracted.

51
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,594
Give me a break.

52
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,929
Ugh.

53
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,136
It's cloudy and misty...

54
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,388
- Joannie, ah!
- Bud!

55
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,889
Hey, Bud, it's not a speedway,
you know?

56
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,311
- Sorry.
- Come on, people.

57
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,070
We got good news, we got bad news,
we got all kinds of news.

58
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,822
- Go ahead, Tina.
- Okay, first,

59
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:39,534
- we lost our editing space again.
- Oh, no!

60
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,216
You know,
they stick us in the library,

61
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,953
then the biology lab,
and now the music room.

62
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,787
Yeah, how come it's always
the film department that gets shafted?

63
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,103
What do you have to do
to be taken seriously around here?

64
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,122
You gotta learn
how to kick ass, man.

65
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,831
Yeah!

66
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:56,841
Well, we are a novelty item.

67
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,255
Every new department

68
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,633
has to make a splash
to get on the map.

69
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:04,011
And that's the good news because
Toby's come up with a great idea.

70
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,309
- Go ahead, Tobe.
- Yeah, Toby!

71
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,683
Here's our new idea.

72
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,769
We do an all-night Horrorthon.

73
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,895
- Ugh.
- No, this is a terrific idea.

74
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,562
An all-night horror show.
They're big grossers.

75
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,231
Hey!
I got a better idea.

76
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,529
Why don't we put on a play?

77
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,863
We'll convert the old barn
into a theater, huh?

78
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,659
- Please.
- Ls there an inherited gene

79
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,244
for obnoxiousness?

80
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,829
- Yeah.
- These are the future writers

81
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,785
and directors
of the American cinema.

82
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,616
It's the "Police Academy" syndrome.

83
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:33,791
Hey, hey!

84
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,129
There's more social relevance

85
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,593
and character development
in "Police Academy 5"

86
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,844
than in all of Ingmar Bergman's
cinematic smorgasbord.

87
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,927
Bergman's fleshy ambiguities,
as one critic said...

88
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,014
- I believe he did say that.
- No, no, no.

89
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,429
Joannie, how would you know?

90
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,577
Your favorite film
is "Escape from Witch Mountain."

91
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,139
Shhh. Hey, fellas!

92
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,349
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

93
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,477
What makes you think
people are gonna pay six bucks

94
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:57,523
to see some crappy old movie
they wouldn't even rent for 99 cents?

95
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,861
Because you can't see "Mosquito"
at home

96
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,816
in 3-D what's it...
What's it called?

97
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,317
- Project-o-vision.
- Right.

98
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:07,118
Nor can you watch "The Stench"
in authentic odor-o-scope.

99
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,494
- Aroma-rama.
- Oh.

100
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,100
Noseguards given at the theatre.

101
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,680
You could use those in lots of movies.

102
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,955
Right.
Or "The Amazing Electrified Man"

103
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,325
in...
- Shock-o-scope.

104
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,501
And that's why

105
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,840
they're gonna pay 10 bucks.

106
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,545
See, every one of these pictures

107
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:24,235
was originally released
with some kind of a promotional gimmick.

108
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,282
Yeah, which
we're gonna recreate for our audience

109
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,263
- only with improvements.
- So, on the one hand,

110
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,320
- it'll be a total goof.
- And on the other hand,

111
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,118
we're gonna scare
the living shit out of them.

112
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,982
So, how do you vote?

113
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,787
Oh, there might be
enough money leftover

114
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,895
for some of you to do your own
little experimental film.

115
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,398
- Bingo!
- I'm in.

116
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,150
Hmm.

117
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,162
Maggie?

118
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,372
We're voting.

119
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,905
Yep.

120
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,050
Welcome to the house of ushers.

121
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,429
Wow.

122
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,466
The old dreamland theater.

123
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,310
It was a live theater
for a long time

124
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,135
before they converted it
to a cinema.

125
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,440
- Toby, it's great.
- Yeah, isn't it?

126
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,355
Kind of sad we're gonna be
its swan song.

127
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,154
They're tearing this place down
in three weeks.

128
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,449
Three weeks?
Are you crazy?

129
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,873
We can't get this festival ready
in three weeks.

130
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:32,242
Yes, you can
because I am here to help you.

131
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,583
Malcolm Mnesyne at your disposal

132
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:39,208
- so to speak.
- Hi, Dr. M.

133
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,536
Hello, Tony.

134
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,251
I'm Toby.

135
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,841
Yes, yes, of course you are,
dear boy.

136
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,217
My cargo is outside

137
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:51,425
and it will require all of you
to bring it in.

138
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,346
I'll be waiting center stage
where I belong.

139
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,726
Thanks a lot for coming, Dr. M.

140
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,899
- Who the hell is this guy?
- Dr. M’s movie memorabilia shop.

141
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,936
He's got everything we need
for the festival.

142
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,992
Now, what you see here

143
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,946
are the priceless relics
of a bygone era of showmanship.

144
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,659
I refer not to myself,

145
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,829
but to the contents
of these crates,

146
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,959
which I have stored
and lovingly tended

147
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:26,627
since my own youthful days
as manager of a movie palace

148
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,223
very much like the dreamland.

149
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,755
We had theaters in those days,

150
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:37,219
not like these cine-, Omni-, multi-,
whatchama-plex things today

151
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,982
with 29 screens

152
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:41,064
the size of postage stamps.

153
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,729
And we had fun.

154
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,397
The ballyhoo,

155
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,026
the giveaways,

156
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,072
the bullshit.

157
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,026
I could tell you stories.

158
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:54,696
The point is we put the butts
in the seats where they belong.

159
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,655
And they loved it.

160
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:02,119
Now, what you guys got
in your festival

161
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,462
are turkeys

162
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,376
and not fresh turkeys either.

163
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,085
But here I am

164
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,546
the master chef of showmanship

165
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:15,177
to teach you
how to turn those withered turkeys

166
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:18,636
into a memorable
moviegoing feast.

167
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:23,228
So, step right up
and we'll all get started.

- No, no,

Vroom.

227
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,530
So, what are we gonna do
with the rest of this stuff, huh?

228
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,532
Dr. M said to store everything back here
until after the Horrorthon.

229
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,905
Hello, what do we have here?

230
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,203
"Warning, do not open."

231
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,197
He didn't say anything
about a film.

232
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,969
Why does it have
a warning sticker on it?

233
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,450
It's probably a nitrate print.

234
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:28,912
Old movies were filmed on stock

235
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,722
- that was highly flammable.
- Yeah, sometimes they used to explode

236
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,001
when exposed to the air.

237
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,209
Knowledge entails risk.

238
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:39,877
Boom!

239
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,891
- What is it?
- I don't know.

240
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,394
It doesn't look very long.

241
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,595
- Wanna run it and find out?
- Why not?

242
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,487
Oh, must be a private eye flick.

243
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:07,079
Yuck, get the Visine.

244
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,376
We got a great cinematic mind
at work here.

245
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:17,746
Yeah, eat your heart out,

246
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,720
- Spielberg.
- I think this is funny.

247
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,887
Nice nose.

248
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,484
I am the possessor.

249
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,017
The possessor, the possessor,

250
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,321
the possessor.

251
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,494
You said that.

252
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:44,152
I am the possess...

253
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:47,121
The possess...

254
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,785
Dossgss...

255
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,333
dossgss...

256
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,773
Oh, no, he's gonna do it.

257
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,421
- I don't believe it.
- Yes.

258
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:59,415
- He's gonna dolly up his nose.
- Yes, yes.

259
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:06,891
Come into...

260
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:10,015
My head.

261
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:14,353
- I'd rather not, thanks.
- Come into

262
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,230
my head.

263
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:25,569
Come into...

264
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:29,447
My head.

265
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,398
She's coming to.

266
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,988
<i>Are you okay, Mag?</i>

267
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,613
Yeah, Mag,
how many fingers I got up?

268
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,660
Will you move back
and let the girl breathe?

269
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,874
- What?
- I'm okay.

270
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,409
What was that movie?

271
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,618
Whatever it is,
it bites the big one.

272
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:17,119
No, no, no, really, what was it?

273
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,001
- I need to know.
- I don't know, but if it's that scary,

274
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,839
maybe we should show it
in the Horrorthon.

275
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,014
Well, I'm not sure of all the facts,

276
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,673
but it's called "Possessor".

277
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,012
It was made by a guy
named Lanyard Gates.

278
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,807
He was, like, the head guru
of this film cult back in the '60s.

279
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,063
They used to drop acid

280
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,184
and make these weird
avant garde movies

281
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,791
of each other
staring into the camera

282
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,646
picking their noses,
stuff like that.

283
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:42,113
- You knew him?
- Oh, I bought into his rap for a while

284
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,145
until I actually saw
one of his films.

285
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,698
It was ludicrous.
The audience laughed it off the stage.

286
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,663
"Possessor" was his response.

287
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:50,834
How do you mean?

288
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,582
He didn't like being laughed at

289
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,793
so he shot all of "Possessor"
except for the last scene.

290
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,825
When he showed the film,
he played the last scene live on stage.

291
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,811
He murdered his family
in front of the audience.

292
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,836
- What?
- Set fire to the theater,

293
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,165
locked the doors.

294
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,459
A lot of people were killed.

295
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,187
I always thought the film
went up in smoke, too,

296
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,797
but I guess
a fragment of it survived.

297
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,969
I think we should just turn it over
to the police.

298
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,898
- Yeah.
- Not a good idea for the Horrorthon.

299
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,056
It's a total bummer.

300
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,464
I mean, who wants to see a film

301
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,347
where a guy really goes berserk
and kills his entire family?

302
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,690
- Mm.
- Exactly.

303
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,815
Back to Dr. M.

304
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,232
- All right.
- Really.

305
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,462
- Mom?
- Oh!

306
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,459
You scared me.

307
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:44,878
You all right?

308
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:47,916
Have you ever heard of this guy

309
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,420
named Lanyard Gates?

310
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,847
No, I don't think so.
Why?

311
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:58,513
Because we found
this film that he made, "Possessor".

312
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:03,774
Mom, I think that this is a man
that I've been dreaming about.

313
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,939
It's really weird.

314
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,239
Maggie,

315
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,243
I want you
to quit this festival.

316
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,656
I'm gonna get some tickets for us
down at the agency

317
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,665
and we'll go away together,
just the two of us.

318
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,907
What are you talking about?

319
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,540
I can't just take off like that.

320
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,247
Well, sure you can.

321
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,377
We never tied ourselves down
before.

322
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,165
And if these dreams
are starting again...

323
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:30,128
Mom, I'm not
gonna run away, okay?

324
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,509
I mean, I can't run away from something
that's inside of my head.

325
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:38,063
I know it sounds
completely off the wall,

326
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,314
but there's something
happening here

327
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,806
that I've been looking for
all of my life.

328
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,939
It's almost like
it's psychic or something.

329
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,477
Does that make any sense?

330
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,525
Yeah.

331
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:53,363
What's wrong?

332
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,162
Oh,

333
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,537
just every once in a while
I realize that you're all grown up

334
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,455
and I miss that little girl
you used to be.

335
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,673
That little girl
who used to need me so much.

336
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,667
- I gotta get to bed.
- Yeah.

337
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,181
- Good night.
- Good night, sweetie.

338
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:29,018
- Hello?
- The ninth circle of hell

339
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,441
- is reserved for traitors.
- Who is this?

340
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,451
I am the possessed,

341
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,873
the possessed, the possessed.

342
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:42,784
- Oh, my god.
- Soon, I will be the possessor.

343
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,582
I want her.

344
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,340
- I want her!
- No!

345
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:51,762
Well, then why don't we talk?

346
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,172
I'm in dreamland.

347
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:58,842
And bring your nasty little gun
in case I turn my back again.

348
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,511

351
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:08,179
The film they tried to stop,
but couldn't.

352
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,100
Fifteen years in the making.

353
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,616
No.

354
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,457
No, Lanyard.

355
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,339
Lanyard.

356
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:46,139
Good-bye, Suzanne.

357
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:53,866
Stop!

358
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:57,419
Lanyard, you know I'll do it!

359
00:22:57,585 --> 00:22:58,585

- Why are you going?

364
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,122
I got through the Horrorthon
and look at me!

365
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,082
Look at me!

366
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,063
- Here's your official Horrorthon kit.
- Thanks!

367
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:17,659
It contains your project-o-vision
3-D glasses,

368
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,171
your aroma-rama noseguard.

369

- Give me two.
- Have a great night.

371
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:26,264
You're gonna love this Horrorthon.

372
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,592
Ooh, awesome head, man.

373
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:36,142
Excuse me.

374
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,308
Pardon me.

375
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,226
What time
does the first show start?

376
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:40,555
Check the shock clock, ma'am.

377
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,819
When it screams,
a feature beams.

378
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,483
Sign the fright form, please.

379
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:48,571
In case you die of a heart attack,
it means we're not responsible.

380
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,947
No! Don't sign it!

381
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:53,485
Think of your families,
your mommies, your daddies,

382
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,119
and Toto at home!
- Excuse me,

383
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,695
it's time for his injection.
- Ah, no!

384
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:00,501
Not the needle!
I'm sorry, Nurse Ratched, I'll be good!

385
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,173
- Thanks.
- Two, please.

386
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,048

00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,465

Fancy meeting you here.

Maggie.

391
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:33,194
Will these films be as shocking
as "Possessor", Sarah?

392
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,910
Two, please.

393
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,986

Help support our film fest.

We are broke.
We can give you these t-shirts for $20.

404
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,447
Come on,
two t-shirts for $20.

405
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:17,366
Come on,
make your boyfriend buy you one.

406
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,724
Don't let him be cheap tonight.
Come on, you're a high roller.

407
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,745
Come on, spend 20 bucks.

408
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,544
What do you want,
a large, a small?

409
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,587
No, you guys need a large.
This is a Horrorthon.

410
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:29,251
- Yeah! Ooh, wah! Yeah!
- You're gonna be all night, okay?

411
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:45,188
Whoo!

412
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,909
Bring on the boos!

413
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,522
Come on, you've got two fives,
he's got a 10.

414
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,728
All right, come on, just spend
all your lunch money right here.

415
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,048
Come on, let's do it!

416
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,934
What in tarnation
could've done this, doc?

417
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:23,057
There's nary a drop of blood left
in any of my sheep.

418
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:24,805
Beats me, Skeeter.

419
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,153
Wait a minute.

420
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:32,443
Look at this large puncture wound
in the back of her neck.

421
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:33,939
Are you sure that's the neck?

422
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:35,111
Gross!

423
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,009
- I'll be right back.
- Somebody just...

424
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,840
- I'm gonna get some popcorn.
- Stuck a big needle

425
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:41,486
or something in them
and just sucked the blood out.

426
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,290
Oh!

427
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:47,123
Someone or something.

428
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,879
Got the whole dang flock.

429
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,245
Even Effie.

430
00:27:57,426 --> 00:28:01,096
Say, you don't think
there's any connection between this

431
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:03,273
and them underground tests

432
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:05,152
the army's been conducting out here,
do you?

433
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,847
It's our army out there, Skeeter.

434
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,480
If we were in danger,
they'd have warned us.

435
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:13,022
Toby.-

436
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,742
I know this sounds really crazy,

437
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,572
but I think I just saw
Lanyard Gates.

438
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:19,107
- Gates?
- Yes, I'm sure it was him.

439
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:20,871
He's older
and his face was burned,

440
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:22,953
but I'm sure it was him.

441
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,488
The guy from the "Possessor".

442
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,871
"Possessor"?

443
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:28,998
Maggie, all we saw was an eyeball
and a bad haircut.

444
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:30,996
How could you recognize anybody
from that?

445
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:33,798
I don't know how I knew
but I'm telling you it was him.

446
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,632
I just... I know it.

447
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,467
Well, Mr. Davis did say
this guy Gates's body

448
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:40,434
was never officially identified.

449
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,394
He said it was a big fire

450
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,224
and the bodies were burned
beyond recognition,

451
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,230
- so maybe he could...
- So maybe he's still alive.

452
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,733
I mean, like, he could be just lurking
somewhere in this theater

453
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:53,397
just waiting to attack us!

454
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,565
- Sounds a little paranoid.
- This is great.

455
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,954
God, Toby, what a great movie
this would make!

456
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,282
We gotta find this guy.

457
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,697
Maggie,
maybe we should call the police.

458
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,986
Oh, yeah, right,
they come right on down here,

459
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,290
"Hello, officer, hi.

460
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:10,504
There was this guy
and he made this movie 15 years ago

461
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,516
and he, like, killed all these people
and everything

462
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,062
and we think
he's at our Film Festival,

463
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,629
blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah."

464
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:17,206
All right.

465
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:19,131
Look, somebody's
gotta watch the booth.

466
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,129
- I'll take a look, okay?
- All right.

467
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,181
Hey, be careful.

468
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,364
Wait.

469
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:41,859
What... what's that, Skeeter?

470
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:45,077
I... I don't know,
but whatever it is,

471
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:46,242
it's getting too close!

472
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,213
Oh!

473
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:18,824
Get it off!

474
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,079
Skeeter, oh, god!

475
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,832
Skeeter!

476
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,477
Now, tell me
this whole thing again.

477
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:03,565
And spell it out for me
this time.

478
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:06,947
- I'm simpleminded.
- And you're ugly, too!

479
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,905
The radiation...

480
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:10,426
from the underground atomic tests

481
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:14,412
stimulated the mosquito's growth
far beyond its normal size.

482
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,871
Latimer, you're a very good vet

483
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:19,042
and a very pretty lady.

484
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:22,422
But a mosquito capable
of that kind of destruction

485
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:24,134
would have to be
as big as a house.

486
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,595
- Excuse me, lieutenant, sir.
- What is it, Corky?

487
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:30,762
We got an emergency
over at fielding's pond, sir.

488
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:33,681
Folks over there
are saying that big larva

489
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,890
are breeding in the water.

490
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,440
Yeah, well, we got people
breeding in the balcony!

491
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,610
Here sooner,
we could've gotten them all at the pond.

492
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:44,857
We got all but one?

493
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,778
Yes, ma'am,
but that's the mother.

494
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:48,667
If I'm right
and she comes back here,

495
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,738
then maybe we...
We've got a chance.

496
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,540
Say, doc...

497
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,293
Boo!

498
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,705
Ow.

499
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:59,463
Mark! Damn it, you scared me.

500
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,626
- Are you okay?
- Mm.

501
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:05,295
Well, if I was a 10-ton mosquito,
I wouldn't waste all my time

502
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:06,705
sucking through all them sheep.

503
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:07,842
No, sir.

504
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,759
I'd head straight for the blood bank.

505
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,058
Okay, corky, go keep a lookout.

506
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:14,562
If you see anything coming,
holler loud and clear.

507
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,684
You got it, sir.

508
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,900
So, uh, tell me,

509
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:26,686
is there a, uh, Mr. latimer?

510
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,492
Not yet.

511
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:32,115
Is there a Mrs. Bradley?

512
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,954
Yeah.

513
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,578
She lives in Kansas.

514
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:41,248
Bakes apple pie.

515
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,422
- I call her mom.
- Whoo!

516
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,049
Hey, no tongues!

517
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:50,505
No tongues!

518
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,257
Careful, Jim.

519
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:54,679
The female mosquito
is the dangerous one.

520
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:57,518
Just thought I should let you know
what you're in for.

521
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,143
Thanks for the warning.

522
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,232
Mayday, mayday!

523
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:03,397
Come on, bugs.

524
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,645
I saw the thing up in the sky!

525
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,237
It's bigger than ever
and it's headed right this way.

526
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,783
Holy cow,
get Washington on the phone pronto.

527
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:13,117
It's picked up the scent
of the plasma.

528
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:16,123
Its proboscis is aimed right at us!

529
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:17,606
Send the air force,
Mr. president.

530
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,622
Don't forget the army, Navy,
and the coast guard.

531
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,579
How about the police dogs
while you're at it?

532
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,350
We need every plane, tank,
and battleship

533
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,496
you've got, Mr. president.

534
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,299
This is one hell of a bug.

535
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:27,803
Thank you, sir.

536
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,134
God bless you, too.

537
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:37,387
I'm scared, lieutenant.

538
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:41,017
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

539
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,857
I will dwell in the house
of the lord forever.

540
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,485
- Jim, it's leaving!
- Amen!

541
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,660
Yahoo!

542
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,643
Nothing fazes it.
We'll have to drop the a-bomb.

543
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:17,973
No, Jim, that's what started
all this trouble in the first place.

544
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,559
Five, four, three,

545
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,515
- two, one.
- Everybody, under the desk!

546
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:25,187
Whoo!

547
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:28,265
Five, four, three...

548
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:32,111
Bye-bye!

549
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:48,089
Go, baby, go, 90!

550
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,191
What the?

551
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:58,275
It's dead.

552
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:02,488
Wow, incinerated beyond belief!

553
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:14,134
- Thanks, guys.
- You're welcome, corky!

554
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,470
We're safe this time, Jim.

555
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,643
There may be a next time.

556
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:22,264
And a next.

557
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:26,015
Do you know
how many species of insects

558
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,644
there are in this world?

559
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:32,270
Mankind must learn
to be ever watchful.

560
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,108
I know one thing, baby.

561
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:40,158
From now on,
I'm gonna be watching you.

562
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,499
Amen.

563
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,091
So, let me get this straight,

564
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,126
this guy Gates,
like, come back from the dead

565
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:43,981
to show some flick he made and, like,
walked up to the movie theater

566
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,345
and bought a ticket like that?

567
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,353
Am I getting this right
or am I just delirious?

568
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:49,984
I didn't say
that he came back from the dead.

569
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:53,733
Right, right, but, well,
this Sarah thing... run that by me again.

570
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:55,857
He called me Sarah.

571
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,074
Maybe he thinks I'm his daughter.

572
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:01,744
Oh. Oh, so Gates
has a daughter named Sarah?

573
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:04,485
- Yes!
- And we know this how?

574
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:07,027
I don't know, Mark,
but I kn... ugh.

575
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,412
You're pissing me off.

576
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:12,119
Well, enjoy your little joke?

577
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,290
- What?
- Locking me out of the theater.

578
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:17,169
I had to climb down the fire escape
and into the side yard.

579
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:18,757
I fell in a trash bin.

580
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:21,972
I twisted my ankle while climbing
the barbed wire fence,

581
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,143
outrunning
a very pissed off doberman.

582
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,802
And now if you'll excuse me,
I have to change reels.

583
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,011
Toby, I didn't do anything,
I swear it.

584
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:32,192
- Oh, yeah? Well, who did, then, huh?
- Don't look at me.

585
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:34,022
- Maybe it was him.
- Who?

586
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:35,937
- You... you mean Gates?
- It could be!

587
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:39,975
Oh, so Gates came back from the dead
to lock Toby out of the theater.

588
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,031
Oh, yeah.

589
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:43,855
That's real cute, Mark.

590
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,570
Come on, Maggie.

591
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,950
I'm only fooling around.

592
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:49,536
Great, why don't you fool around
with joy, then?

593
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,909
Get out of here.

594
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,784
- How many?
- Just one.

595
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:25,574
- Hi.
- Did you have a nice break?

596
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:28,408
- I'm really sorry. Thanks.
- Yeah. Later.

597
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:30,485
- Great, there you go.
- Thanks.

598
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,830
Two popcorns, please.

599
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:34,956
What's up, player?

600
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:36,833
Don't ask.

601
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,040
The prisoner will stand.

602
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,052
There being no legal cause

603
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,594
why a sentence
should not be pronounced...

604
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:48,258
Your honor,
the defense would like the court

605
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:49,718
to consider the fact...

606
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:51,968
Joy, what's the story?

607
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:58,308
Hey, I tried to save it for you,
but you were gone for so long.

608
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,293
- The court would be lenient.
- Hey, man, you're in my seat.

609
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,816
It is the judgment
and sentence of this court...

610
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:05,815
Eat shit, asshole.

611
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:09,197
That for the crime
of murder in the first degree...

612
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,365
You wanna repeat that, pal?

613
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,044
Huh?

614
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:20,789
I said eat shit, asshole.

615
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:24,382
And may god have mercy
on your soul.

616
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,877
Whoo-hoo!

617
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:30,090
Ooh, nice shot, dude.

618
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,390
Oh.

619
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,228
Isn't Mr. Davis here?

620
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:39,403
He's backstage.
Will you tell him I need him?

621
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:40,732
What for?

622
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,727
Every one of these buttons here
represents a wired seat down there.

623
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,030
They're supposed to go off
in automatic sequence,

624
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:47,714
only I don't know
how to set the timer.

625
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:50,619
So in the meanwhile, I'm gonna
have to zap everybody manually.

626
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:53,202
That's fascinating, Bud.
I'll tell him.

627
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:55,038
- Tell me...
- Tell him, then.

628
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:59,703
What do you know
about erythrocytes and leukocytes?

629
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:04,499
Say, aren't those the red and white
corpuscles in the blood?

630
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:07,218
Very good, Vernon.

631
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:12,799
I have created a third corpuscle...

632
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:15,306
The "magnecyte."

633
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:19,643
Theoretically, it can regenerate
the blood cells

634
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:22,941
even after severe trauma,
any trauma.

635
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,896
Even electrocution.

636
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:28,815
I get it.

637
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:32,663
You want to inject me
with this corpuscle

638
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:35,164
to see if I can survive the chair,
is that it?

639
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,446
Exactly.

640
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,559
There's this mystery in her own life

641
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,209
that she hasn't solved yet,
which...

642
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:43,673
Sarah, wake up.

643
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,335
Your life has been a dream.

644
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,304
You are possessed.

645
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,259
Mark!

646
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:57,521
Sorry!

647
00:41:57,682 --> 00:42:00,272
- What are you doing here?
- I just came to talk to you.

648
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,035
Hey, listen, you remember
that guy Gates?

649
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:03,563
I can prove that he was here.

650
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,650
When we were gone,
he came into the box office

651
00:42:05,815 --> 00:42:07,315
and he left a message
on my recorder.

652
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,363
Listen. Shit!

653
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,147
Shit, I must've smashed it
into the door.

654
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,321
Tina was here.
I bet she saw him.

655
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,780
Cheryl, did you see
where Tina went?

656
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,331
- Check with Bud. He might know.
- Great.

657
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,745
It's time, Vernon.

658
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,714
I'm ready, warden.

659
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,130
So long, Vernon.

660
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:35,141
Adios, big Gil.

661
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:37,143
Warm it up for me, Vernon.

662
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:38,555
Anytime, Maxie.

663
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:41,563
Hey, Vernon,
whatever they tell you, don't sit down!

664
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:45,476
I'll keep that in mind, Otis.

665
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,306
Vernon, when you get to heaven,

666
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:49,072
will you tell my ma
I said hello?

667
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,073
I ain't going to heaven, Bobby.

668
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:53,855
But I'll sure be glad
to say hello to your daddy.

669
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,288
Mr. Davis?

670
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,326
Hey, that mosquito gag
was great.

671
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,130
Hey, Bud, where's Tina?

672
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,300
Jesus, you almost made me
zap the third row.

673
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:18,139
Cheryl said
she was up here with you.

674
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,684
Well, she's looking for Davis.
Check backstage.

675
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,138
Hey, you'll need this.

676
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,849
Thanks.

677
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,779
<i>Sauté</i> the sucker!

678
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:35,815
Fry him!

679
00:43:38,074 --> 00:43:41,544
- Fry him!
- Make mine medium rare!

680
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,872
Fry him! Fry him!

681
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:49,748
All right, kids,
here comes Dr. zap.

682
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,669
Any last words?

683
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:56,014
See you later.

684
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:11,231
And away we go.

685
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,278
Bingg!

686
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:24,248
Boop!

687
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:28,828
Attention,
hemorrhoid sufferers...

688
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:35,756
You, sir, have just received
the Ted Bundy award.

689
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,051
Yes!

690
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:42,218
Ah, this is fun.
I like doing this.

691
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:46,517
Boo!

692
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:54,151
Bud needs you.

693
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:59,071
And by the way, so do I.

694
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,526
Your lip, it's peeling.

695
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:05,240
Nerves.

696
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,121
How about a quickie right here

697
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:11,208
with just that little screen between us
and public exposure?

698
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:14,285
Everybody always wonders
how I get those straight as.

699
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:18,262
I keep telling them
I do lots of extra credit assignments.

700
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:27,683
My god, he's still breathing.

701
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:32,982
Mm!

702
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,555
What can we do?

703
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,635
Get Washington on the line.

704
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,271
Pronto.

705
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,464
I don't see him.

706
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,210
Shoot

707
00:46:36,377 --> 00:46:38,747
I see you.

708
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,921
Wow, Maggie.
Maggie, check this out.

709
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,971
Tina, you scared me.

710
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:46,756
Are you okay?

711
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,509
Mm-hmm.

712
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:50,811
Shh.

713
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:52,265
Audience.

714
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:55,645
Right, um,
what are you doing up here?

715
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,193
Securing the mosquito.

716
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:00,897
Hey, listen, did you see anybody

717
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,068
come into the box office
after I left?

718
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,277
Mr. Davis.

719
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:06,868
Where'd he go?

720
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:08,623
He just left.

721
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,204
Damn it.

722
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,039
Well, maybe
I could still catch him.

723
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:15,374
Tina should start eating better.
She looks like shit.

724
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,791
Bye.

725
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,916
- How's the movie?
- Too scary for me.

726
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,930
I need some popcorn
to calm me down.

727
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,432
Thank god it's not fattening.

728
00:47:26,594 --> 00:47:29,314
And a Milky Way, too, please.

729
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:30,892
- Joannie!
- Cheryl!

730
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:33,057
I am not having any butter
on my popcorn

731
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:36,305
and you can get me a diet Pepsi
so it all balances out in the end.

732
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:39,359
Yeah, that's exactly where
it's gonna balance out... in your end.

733
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:42,707
He must be able
to change his appearances.

734
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,070
- Who? What?
- Mark!

735
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,356
Now we're gonna have to walk

736
00:47:45,488 --> 00:47:46,798
all the way around the building.
- Shit.

737
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:48,822
Yeah, who did you say
could change his appearances?

738
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,991
Gates.
I saw him buy a ticket.

739
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,250
But Tina just said it was Davis
who came into the box office.

740
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:57,413
Now, she wouldn't have let Gates in
unless she thought he was somebody else,

741
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:58,668
somebody that she knew.

742
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:01,424
So, obviously,
he must disguise himself.

743
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:04,667
Oh, no, wait, no disguise
looks that real that close up.

744
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,090
Maybe.

745
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,838
Wait a minute.

746
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:11,722
Hmm, this is Davis's car.
That's his briefcase.

747
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:12,889
He must still be inside.

748
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:15,977
Maggie, who are we looking for,
Davis or Gates?

749
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:19,233
If Gates is walking around
disguised as Davis,

750
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:21,397
that probably means
there isn't a Davis.

751
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:22,875
- I'm gonna go find...
- Wait, wait, hold it, hold it,

752
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,630
let's just cut to the lot
like Toby did, remember?

753
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:26,462
- What do you mean? There's a fence.
- So we'll climb it.

754
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:29,337
- But there's a barbed wire fence.
- Maggie, we'll fly over it, all right?

755
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:30,365
Will you just trust me?

756
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:34,083
Wait, Mark, Toby said
he got attacked by a guard dog.

757
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:37,035
Babe, any guard dog
that Toby can handle,

758
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:38,866
Mark can handle, too, okay?

759
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,041
Come on.

760
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:43,706
Hey, Tina,
have you found Davis yet?

761
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,589
Oh, yes.

762
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:53,889
Hey! What the...

763
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,846
Hey!

764
00:48:57,017 --> 00:49:00,267
This is cute, Tina,
but I have a cue in five minutes.

765
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:02,228
Oh, okay.

766
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:04,898
Very kinky.
What do you... oh!

767
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,987
What's going on here?

768
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:09,363
Tina! Mm!

769
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,740
Mm!

770
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,577
Stop right there, man.

771
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:28,884
Hey, Bobby,

772
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:32,389
get a load of this crazy cat.

773
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:33,643
Yeah, bird brain.

774
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,184
We're addressing you.

775
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:04,625
Whoo!

776
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,802
Well, Bud,

777
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:11,014
you'll get a charge out of this.

778
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:12,215
Watch the panel.

779
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:15,554
The lights will go on
in the following order...

780
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:18,311
Red, blue, green.

781
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:21,484
Or is that green, blue...

782
00:50:21,644 --> 00:50:22,944
Oh, I forget.

783
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,483
But the important light
is that yellow one.

784
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:28,228
When it turns on, Bud,
so do you.

785
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,489
All right, big guy.

786
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:35,445
Come to papa.

787
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:48,047
Hey, he's got Ritchie!

788
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:49,462
Let go of Ritchie, man!

789
00:50:58,389 --> 00:50:59,769
Richie!

790
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,866
Oh, my god, what happened to him?

791
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:20,413
He fell off this fence
and there was this doberman.

792
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:22,038
Yeah, forget about that,
all right?

793
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:23,374
No big deal.

794
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:25,749
Whoa, this is a job
for nurse joannie.

795
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,036
- Hey, I'm fine.
- Bend over.

796
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,627
He's coming this way.

797
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:34,969
Kiss me, dick.

798
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:37,594
Kiss your what?

799
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,391
- All done.
- Have you guys seen Davis?

800
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:41,596
No.

801
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,055
Let's go talk to Bud.

802
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:44,805
Give me a hand.

803
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:47,347
- Watch the candy counter.
- I love it.

804
00:51:49,732 --> 00:51:51,022
No, Vernon.

805
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,741
Have you heard, Peggy?

806
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:57,032
I'm high voltage these days.

807
00:51:57,197 --> 00:52:00,527
Always been high voltage
to me, Vernon.

808
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:07,917
Pucker up, baby!

809
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:15,223
Well, well.

810
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:19,552
- What do we have here?
- Burn him dead!

811
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,930
Burn the guy dead!

812
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,177
It's great!
They're eating it up in there!

813
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:26,810
I know, I cannot believe
the stunts actually worked.

814
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,517
- And now that we are alone.
- Um, sure.

815
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,239
Come on!
Come on, darling, run!

816
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:39,243
Be happy, dick, and remember me.

817
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,066
But...

818
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:13,822
What the hell's going on?

819
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:15,532
This is not scheduled.

820
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:41,008
Wow.

821
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:43,466
Leon, this is weird.

822
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:45,807
Was all this supposed to happen?

823
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:47,643
No, I don't think so.

824
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:50,098
Okay, okay, we've gotta turn the lights
back on.

825
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:51,469
What?
I don't know from lights.

826
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:53,333
- That's Toby's department.
- This is a blackout.

827
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:55,075
There are a thousand people
inside there, Leon.

828
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:56,227
They'll riot.

829
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,900
The band!

830
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,228
- Good idea.
- Where are they?

831
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,741
- The green room. Okay.
- Let's go.

832
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:03,324
- Now, what the hell was that?
- I don't know.

833
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,700
Don't let go.
You might fall down the st...

834
00:54:05,868 --> 00:54:07,328
Shit.

835
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:10,374
Shit!
I'll get him. Mark!

836
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:11,669
Talk to me.

837
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:13,462
- Are you okay?
- Fine, fine!

838
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:15,835
Just don't step on my hand!

839
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:18,803
Oh, jeez.
I'm gonna go talk to Bud.

840
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:22,842
Ladies and gentlemen,
we hope to be off auxiliary power soon

841
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:24,180
and get back to the movie.

842
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:26,184
Meanwhile,
let's bring out the band!

Bud.

851
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:38,956
Sarah.

852
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:42,837
- Oh, my god.
- What, no kiss for daddy?

853
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:46,176
- Who are you?
- Oh, that hurts.

854
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:50,263
There's so great a wound
as an ungrateful child.

855
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:52,640
I'm not Sarah.
I'm not your daughter.

856
00:55:52,808 --> 00:55:54,478
I'm not your child.

857
00:55:54,643 --> 00:55:56,733
Oh, yes.

858
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:59,109
Think.

859
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:02,403
An altar, a sword,

860
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:05,238
mommy dearest.

861
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:07,614
The fire,

862
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,951
a gunshot.

863
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:13,447
And now it's time
to join your mother.

864
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:16,827
No!

865
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:30,679
Sarah.

866
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:42,938
Sarah!

867
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,320
Sarah.

868
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,075
Sarah.

869
00:57:02,044 --> 00:57:03,924
Sarah.

870
00:57:32,491 --> 00:57:35,201
Sarah.

871
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:49,125
Oh! Hey!

872
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,009
Hey!

873
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,836
Maggie, what's the matter?

874
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:55,931
Oh, my god.
Gates just tried to kill me.

875
00:57:56,098 --> 00:57:59,308
He killed Bud
and maybe Tina and Davis, too.

876
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,596
Toby,

877
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:03,730
he's my father.

878
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:07,185
I remember.

879
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:08,859
I remember the whole thing.

880
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:10,897
Wait, Maggie.

881
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:13,031
Shit.

882
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:17,743
My, my, my.

883
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:21,001
And what could you two be doing
all alone in the dark?

884
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,754
Come on, let's get out of here.

00:58:27,713 --> 00:58:30,973
♪ So then come,

886
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:33,513

892
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:58,867
Toby,

893
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:01,076
it's not a screenplay
that I've been writing.

894
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:02,826
It's my life.

895
00:59:02,998 --> 00:59:05,578
My unconscious
has been trying to make me

896
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:09,711
relive my past
so that I would remember it.

897
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,460
I'm Sarah Gates.

898
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:13,671
I'm not Maggie Butler.

899
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:15,972
Suzanne's not my mother,
she's my aunt.

900
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:19,927
My mother's name was Gloria.

901
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:24,347
My father killed her
the night that he showed "Possessor".

902
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,369
He tried to kill me, too,
but Suzanne stopped it.

903
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,606
She shot him and she saved me

904
00:59:28,774 --> 00:59:30,694
and I don't know,
somehow we got away.

905
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:33,739
She changed our names
and our identities

906
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:35,614
to protect me.

907
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:36,781
From Gates?

908
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:39,028
Well, his body was never found,

909
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:41,081
so nobody could ever prove
that he was dead.

910
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:43,664
She never knew
when he'd come back.

911
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,870
Now he's here.

912
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:47,751
Why, Maggie?

913
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:49,958
To finish the film.

914
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:52,798
And to kill me.

915
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:56,301
God, Toby.

916
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:59,138
My brain is just, like, reeling.

917
01:00:01,473 --> 01:00:02,973
Hey.

918
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:04,641
Hey.

919
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:09,476
Hey, I'm here for you, Maggie,
all the way.

920
01:00:11,191 --> 01:00:12,691
Come on.

921
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,569
Let's get
the lights turned on, huh?

922
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:17,703
We gotta call the police.

923
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:20,034
Okay,
but let's do this first, huh?

924
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:24,582
Well, down the rabbit hole.

925
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:27,706
- The rabbit hole?
- And into wonderland.

926
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:30,084
That's a little humor there.

927
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:32,922
It's the only way
to get to the circuit breakers.

928
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:37,260
- Whoa!
- Toby!

929
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:39,215
Are you all right?

930
01:00:39,386 --> 01:00:42,386
Toby!

931
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:45,016
Toby!

932
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:50,438
Toby, where are you?

933
01:00:51,523 --> 01:00:53,113
Toby?

934
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:03,869
Mr. Davis!

935
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:05,615
Mr. Davis?

936
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,370
Toby?

937
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:16,212
- Sarah.
- Tina?

938
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:20,302
Tina, is... is that you?

939
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:21,468
Tina!

940
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:24,756
Sarah.

941
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:32,524
Oh!

942
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,692
Stop!

943
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:39,821
Stop. Please.

944
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:44,704
Stop, please!

945
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:49,788
Welcome home.

946
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:54,456

947
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:56,090

950
01:02:02,344 --> 01:02:05,394
Okay, we got our lights back on.
Let's get on with the show!

951
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:08,598
Whoo!

952
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:45,721
Who are you?

953
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:49,850
I'm Toby.

954
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:52,176
Or... or nearly Toby.

955
01:02:52,352 --> 01:02:55,232
You'll have to forgive the...

956
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:57,857
Sloppy craftsmanship.

957
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:01,244
Actually,
it takes hours every morning

958
01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:04,823
to prepare the perfect Toby
for the world to see.

959
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:08,450
In truth, I've perfected
the quick transition

960
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,158
from face to face.

961
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:13,998
Of course,
I have to borrow their faces to do it.

962
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:18,245
You might say
I'm "multidentical".

963
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:27,760
Now, with a little nip here
and a little tuck there

964
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:30,059
I become "multisexual".

965
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:31,773
Nothing new about that, huh?

966
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:34,983
And as you've heard with the help
of electronic voice harmonics,

967
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:37,805
I become Tina, the class bimbo.

968
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:44,316
I can look like
anybody I want to.

969
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:48,867
It's one of the few advantages
of not having a face.

970
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:52,914
- Then you're not...
- Your father?

971
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:54,499
No.

972
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:57,174
Lanyard Gates is dead.

973
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:59,964
Died in the fire 15 years ago.

974
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:02,798
If you're Toby, why are you...

975
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:05,304
Why am I going to kill you?
Is that your question?

976
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:08,177
- Why are you doing this?
- Oh!

977
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:11,505
Good question.

978
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,811
Same answer, actually.

979
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:15,765
See,

980
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:19,975
I was caught in that fire, too.

981
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:25,494
My mother
was in Lanyard's so-called film cult.

982
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:28,493
We were sitting in the front row

983
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:32,116
when your aunt Suzanne
shot Lanyard

984
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:34,495
and set fire to the theater.

985
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:39,917
You, luckily, got out.

986
01:04:40,085 --> 01:04:43,625
We, unluckily,

987
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:45,917
did not.

988
01:04:46,091 --> 01:04:47,471
My mother died.

989
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:52,134
I lost most of the flesh
on my body.

990
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:57,601
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, are you?

991
01:04:57,769 --> 01:05:00,349
Well, that makes it
all right, then!

992
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:02,572
Here, I'll just let you go.

993
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,732
You're sorry?

994
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:06,861
Look at me!

995
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:13,446
This is your work!

996
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:15,368
Don't like it, huh?

997
01:05:15,537 --> 01:05:17,247
You don't have to look!

998
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:19,424
Don't look!

999
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,132
Don't look at me!

1000
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:23,712
I was a child, too, Toby!

1001
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:25,798
You were a child?
Good.

1002
01:05:25,964 --> 01:05:28,474
I was a child.
We were all children.

1003
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:32,353
Nobody was a child like me.

1004
01:05:32,512 --> 01:05:33,932
Nobody.

1005
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:36,967
Shall I describe the...
The years of surgery

1006
01:05:37,142 --> 01:05:38,642
I went through, huh?

1007
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:41,850
The skin grafts,
the prosthetic pieces.

1008
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:45,021
I had to glue on my face
all through school

1009
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:47,281
every day of my life

1010
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:49,454
so the other kids
wouldn't scream.

1011
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:52,952
Nobody saw me coming, huh?

1012
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:56,576
Here, I'll show you
how it works.

1013
01:05:56,744 --> 01:06:00,004
Now, the first thing we do

1014
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:02,575
is we cover up
these fried egg eyes

1015
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:04,500
with contact lenses.

1016
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:11,300
Lovely.

1017
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:17,684
Toby.

1018
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,890
Ah.

1019
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:24,150
Now a new nose.

1020
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:26,074
There.

1021
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:31,030
- Please stop.
- Then we prepare a face

1022
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:32,906
to meet the faces that we meet.

1023
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:36,029
A lovely chin.

1024
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:41,119
Yeah.

1025
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:49,839
It's my scarecrow in oz face.

1026
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,466
Cute, huh?

1027
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:54,552
You're crazy.

1028
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:58,509
What, this just dawned on you?

1029
01:06:58,681 --> 01:06:59,721
That's great.

1030
01:06:59,891 --> 01:07:02,061
And I'm the one who's crazy.

1031
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:08,188
Can't say I've lost
my sense of humor, can you?

1032
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:09,568
Toby.

1033
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:12,282
What are you gonna do?

1034
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:15,775
Mm, here's my plan.

1035
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:19,409
I've thought it out
with geometric logic.

1036
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:24,158
I'm going to recreate
that showing of "Possessor"

1037
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:28,832
only this time,
it's going exactly as planned.

1038
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:32,883
And maybe that way,
things will be different.

1039
01:07:34,342 --> 01:07:38,302
Maybe,
then my mother won't die...

1040
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,892
And I won't be burned.

1041
01:07:43,351 --> 01:07:47,101
And everything will be okay.

1042
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:50,938
That makes perfect sense.

1043
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:54,149
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

1044
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:04,462
- Yuck!
- Oh, pee-yew, what is that?

1045
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:08,002
Hmm, I don't know.
Could be swamp gas.

1046
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:10,537
Well, it doesn't smell like
swamp gas to me.

1047
01:08:10,712 --> 01:08:13,212
Well, it's not me.

1048
01:08:13,381 --> 01:08:14,631
I'm not so sure.

1049
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:16,839
Well, whatever it is,
it's getting worse.

1050
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:18,050
Yuck.

1051
01:08:18,219 --> 01:08:19,599
Mark, if you keep this up,

1052
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,872
you're gonna have to hire
your own private nurse before long.

1053
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:23,599
There you are,
you son of a bitch!

1054
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:25,476
Oh, no.

1055
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:28,943
- I wanna go home now.
- Hi, joy.

1056
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:32,605
Look, I'm sorry,
but Maggie had some problems

1057
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:33,815
and I had to help her out.

1058
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:37,743
Maggie? What, are you
obsessed with this bitch or what?

1059
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:41,575
God, I knew you didn't have any brains,
but I thought you had some taste.

1060
01:08:41,743 --> 01:08:42,953
Why don't you just cool out?

1061
01:08:44,162 --> 01:08:47,372
Why don't you just
shut your little mouth, you little slut?

1062
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:48,960
And as far as Maggie goes,

1063
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:51,125
I saw her leave here
with that little film nerd.

1064
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:52,424
- What's his name?
- Toby?

1065
01:08:52,587 --> 01:08:53,837
Yeah, that's right, Toby.

1066
01:08:54,005 --> 01:08:56,335
I caught them in the dark
and they were going at it.

1067
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:57,717
They were hot and heavy.

1068
01:08:57,884 --> 01:09:00,154
And you wouldn't believe it,
they're on their way to his house.

1069
01:09:00,178 --> 01:09:01,798
You're full of shit.

1070
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:04,471
Hey, asshole!

1071
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:05,891
Oh, no.

1072
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:08,979
Uh-oh.
- You got a problem?

1073
01:09:12,857 --> 01:09:15,107
I said you got a problem?

1074
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:17,106
- No, do you?
- He hit me. Kick his ass!

1075
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:18,758
- Kick his ass!
- Uh-uh, wait, wait, wait,

1076
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:20,800
wait a minute,
this boy's been getting beat up all day.

1077
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:24,283
- You want him, you gotta go through me.
- I don't hit chicks. Now back off!

1078
01:09:24,452 --> 01:09:26,082
You don't hit chicks?
You swear to god?

1079
01:09:26,245 --> 01:09:28,455
I ain't never hit a chick
in my life.

1080
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:30,293
That's all I wanted to know.

1081
01:09:30,458 --> 01:09:32,498
Rad!

1082
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:34,549
- I could've done that.
- You bitch!

1083
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:37,672
- Oh, my hair!
- Punk-ass blonde bitch!

1084
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,470
- Get your sorry ass out of here.
- You're messing with my hair!

1085
01:09:40,635 --> 01:09:44,385
- It's not your hair anyway!
- I'm gonna bust your butt, bad boy.

1086
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:51,015
God damn it!

1087
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:54,267
- I got you, wimp! You ain't shit!
- Oh! He's going for the side door!

1088
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,070
I can't believe
she went to Toby's house.

1089
01:09:56,234 --> 01:09:58,244
Toby and Maggie, are you crazy?

1090
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:00,923
- You believe that dumb bitch?
- You guys know where Toby lives?

1091
01:10:01,072 --> 01:10:04,282
48 Crescent Road, apartment 73
about five blocks away.

1092
01:10:05,827 --> 01:10:06,827
Believe it.

1093
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:10,374
She's the world's authority
on Toby d'Amato.

1094
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,710
- Use the side door.
- Right.

1095
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:15,245
Oh, my god, my stench cue!
I'm late.

1096
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:17,840
Almost time.

1097
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:20,795
Lanyard Gates
began "Possessor" at midnight.

1098
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:23,337
And we will follow
in his footsteps.

1099
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:26,561
Wait, I forgot the other member

1100
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:28,813
of the original cast.

1101
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:31,515
- Ta-da!
- Mom?

1102
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,530
Sarah, mom.

1103
01:10:39,694 --> 01:10:41,904
Mom, Sarah.

1104
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,491
Maggie, forgive me.

1105
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:46,197
Hey, sure, why not?

1106
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:49,537
All she did was murder your father,
destroy his life's work,

1107
01:10:49,704 --> 01:10:51,254
and then lie to you
your whole life.

1108
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:54,424
Sure, say a couple of Hail Marys
and forget the whole thing.

1109
01:10:54,584 --> 01:10:57,754
Maggie, he was giving you acid.
I had to get you out.

1110
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,260
Liar, liar,
face on fire, face on fire!

1111
01:11:00,423 --> 01:11:02,933
Toby, don't do this, please!

1112
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:06,222
- Toby!
- Lanyard Gates was crazy!

1113
01:11:06,387 --> 01:11:07,467
I am rubber, you're glue.

1114
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:10,078
Everything that you're saying
bounces off me and sticks on you!

1115
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:12,059
- Toby, no!
- Sticks on you!

1116
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:14,646
Sticks on you,
sticks on you, sticks on you.

1117
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:17,562
Oh.

1118
01:11:20,902 --> 01:11:22,572
Half an hour to midnight.

1119
01:11:22,737 --> 01:11:25,737
I still have
a little time to kill.

1120
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:27,117
Hmm.

1121
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:33,615
Where the hell have you been?

1122
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:35,810
- Get the odor pellets.
- Okay. Which one goes first?

1123
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:37,503
- I forgot.
- Body odor.

1124
01:11:37,668 --> 01:11:39,798
- That's disgusting.
- No, it's not B.O.

1125
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:41,922
It's body odor
as in the odor of a dead body.

1126
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:43,299
Oh, much better.

1127
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:45,266
Anyway, I wanna get back
to what I was saying.

1128
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:47,534
Yeah, just hold that thought, okay?
I gotta take a leak first.

1129
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:50,013
- We've got a cue coming up.
- We got five minutes.

1130
01:12:38,396 --> 01:12:41,936
Hey! Hey!
Let me out!

1131
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:45,278
This isn't funny!

1132
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:51,077
Oh, shit!

1133
01:12:51,242 --> 01:12:54,252
No! Please, no!

1134
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:09,677
Took you long enough.

1135
01:13:09,844 --> 01:13:12,514
- I had some gas.
- Spare me the details.

1136
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:14,850
Anyway, what do you think?

1137
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:17,686
- About what?
- Toby.

1138
01:13:17,852 --> 01:13:19,272
Does he like me?

1139
01:13:21,939 --> 01:13:23,649
Like you?

1140
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:25,936
What's wrong with your voice?
You sound so weird.

1141
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:30,110
- I got a frog in my throat.
- Sounds like a crocodile.

1142
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:32,911
Anyway, I need to know.

1143
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:35,985
I mean, I'm walking around
madly in love with this guy

1144
01:13:36,162 --> 01:13:38,002
and he just acts like
I don't even exist.

1145
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:40,254
You're impartial.
What's your opinion?

1146
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,246
Is he shy or what?

1147
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:45,498
Look, I've got my own problems.
Just leave me alone, all right?

1148
01:13:47,715 --> 01:13:49,045
Men.

1149
01:13:49,216 --> 01:13:50,796
Admit it, you fucked up.

1150
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:56,386
Don't you... I got...
I got problems of my own here!

1151
01:13:56,557 --> 01:14:00,057
Don't you...
Don't you talk about love to me!

1152
01:14:00,227 --> 01:14:02,437
We're gonna make a movie here!

1153
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:09,107
Come on, baby.

1154
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:16,834
Wait, it's getting stronger.

1155
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:18,624
Ooh, my nose is burning!

1156
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:21,476
Well, I don't know
what you're doing,

1157
01:14:21,499 --> 01:14:22,829
but I'm getting out of here.

1158
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Good idea.
Let's head for camp.

1159
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:34,513
My lungs are burning!

1160
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:36,599
Hey, my legs won't move!

1161
01:14:36,764 --> 01:14:38,354
I can't see!
I can't see!

1162
01:14:38,516 --> 01:14:40,306
Just a normal life

1163
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:42,636
filled with normal happiness.

1164
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:44,982
Hmm, normal sadness.

1165
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:47,687
Normal family stuff.

1166
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:49,938
Normal kids of my own.

1167
01:14:50,111 --> 01:14:54,611
Do you know
how amazing normal stuff seems

1168
01:14:55,074 --> 01:14:58,294
when there's no chance
you'll ever have it for yourself?

1169
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:03,962
And whose fault was that, huh?

1170
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:08,375
Whose fault was that,
nasty Suzanne?

1171
01:15:08,546 --> 01:15:11,836
Nasty Suzanne and her nasty gun.

1172
01:15:12,008 --> 01:15:14,888
Bang, bang went nasty Suzanne.

1173
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:17,682
Bang, bang went her nasty gun.

1174
01:15:17,847 --> 01:15:22,017
Well... well, not this time,
Ms. pretty skin.

1175
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:24,234
Go ahead.
Go ahead, try it, huh?

1176
01:15:26,063 --> 01:15:29,153
No, huh? No.

1177
01:15:31,819 --> 01:15:35,029
I am so glad
I cast you in this part.

1178
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:55,773
If you don't stop it soon,

1179
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:58,141
there's no telling
what might happen.

1180
01:15:58,304 --> 01:16:01,564
Hmm, I fear you are right...

1181
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:04,314
Better get Tokyo
on the line, pronto.

1182
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:12,435
Who the hell are you?

1183
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:15,070
I'm a friend of Toby's.
Is he here?

1184
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:17,857
If he was here, he'd be dead.
Look at this place.

1185
01:16:18,032 --> 01:16:20,162
You say you're a friend of his?

1186
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:21,826
I ought to kill you.

1187
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:23,634
Maybe that'd make me feel
a little better.

1188
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:26,830
What did he do?

1189
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:28,669
What did he do?
What the hell did he do?

1190
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:30,964
Jesus Christ,
what the hell didn't he do?

1191
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:33,628
The guy's a goddamn lunatic.

1192
01:16:33,798 --> 01:16:36,628
Should've thrown his ass out
six months ago.

1193
01:16:36,801 --> 01:16:39,181
Yelling and screaming
all night long

1194
01:16:39,345 --> 01:16:40,925
at the top of his lungs.

1195
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:44,057
Never let anybody in the place.
Oh, I only wonder why.

1196
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:46,185
- Look at all this shit.
- What?

1197
01:16:46,352 --> 01:16:48,272
The goddamn smell.
I mean, it's just...

1198
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,937
- Oh, my god.
- It was like some chemical smell.

1199
01:16:52,191 --> 01:16:55,651
I had to break
the goddamn door down to get in here

1200
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:57,300
- because the tub overflowed...
- Oh, no.

1201
01:16:57,321 --> 01:16:59,451
...and it flooded
the apartment downstairs.

1202
01:17:01,242 --> 01:17:03,202
You know...
You know what he's got in that tub?

1203
01:17:03,369 --> 01:17:07,119
He's got... he's got things
that look like human skulls

1204
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:09,209
and... and body parts.

1205
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:13,415
Probably some... some kind of
Jack the Ripper or something.

1206
01:17:14,505 --> 01:17:16,505
Ah, son of a bitch.

1207
01:17:18,717 --> 01:17:20,257
What are you doing?

1208
01:17:20,427 --> 01:17:22,887
Just say yes.

1209
01:17:23,055 --> 01:17:24,305
Toby!

1210
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:27,063
Anyway, that's what
I gotta say about him.

1211
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:32,943
Yeah, look at that.
The guy can't paint either.

1212
01:17:33,107 --> 01:17:35,187
Isn't that
a real piece of crap there?

1213
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:39,409
Hey! That's Gloria Gates!

1214
01:17:39,572 --> 01:17:41,322
I did a picture with her.

1215
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:42,950
You're a director?

1216
01:17:43,117 --> 01:17:44,827
Hey, listen, you're a director?

1217
01:17:44,994 --> 01:17:49,334
I-I'm an actor.
You wanna take a picture or résumé?

1218
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:53,086
Well, how about we do lunch?

1219
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:02,723
It came from outer space.

1220
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:05,927
We know that now.
We must be ever vigilant and never rest.

1221
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:09,058
Keep our eyes on the heavens
or the stench will...

1222
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:11,346
♪ Let's all go to the lobby ♪

1223
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,150
♪ and have ourselves a treat... ♪

1224
01:18:13,314 --> 01:18:14,364
...into the shelter.

1225
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:16,603
This place can only be avoided
if we can get to the...

1226
01:18:20,446 --> 01:18:22,566
- Come on!
- Boo!

1227
01:18:30,414 --> 01:18:32,174
I am the possessor.

1228
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:35,343
- Who put this junk on?
- Where's Toby? Do something!

1229
01:18:35,502 --> 01:18:38,212
- Do what?
- The projection booth!

1230
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:45,095
Yeah, it stinks, doesn't it?

1231
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:47,142
Ooh, I hate this movie.

1232
01:18:47,306 --> 01:18:49,766
Yeah, thumbs down on this movie.

1233
01:18:49,934 --> 01:18:51,774
Ooh, I hate this movie.

1234
01:18:51,936 --> 01:18:54,016
Hate this movie! Ugh!

1235
01:18:54,188 --> 01:18:57,068
- Get this movie off the screen!
- Hey, fix your makeup, dude.

1236
01:18:57,233 --> 01:18:59,323
Yeah, yours is a bitch, too.

1237
01:18:59,485 --> 01:19:01,695
Get it on!
Get on with this movie!

1238
01:19:03,197 --> 01:19:05,157
Okay.
Okay, this should stop it.

1239
01:19:05,324 --> 01:19:07,914
- It's not stopping.
- Cheryl, make it stop!

1240
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:10,907
What do you want me to do,
stick my hand in it? Stop!

1241
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:14,420
Sweet, dreamy Sarah.

1242
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:18,803
You've stolen my heart.

1243
01:19:18,963 --> 01:19:21,473
Oh, what have we here?

1244
01:19:21,632 --> 01:19:25,392
Oh, I hope I got your size.

1245
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:29,432
And you thought iron maiden
was a heavy metal band.

1246
01:19:37,982 --> 01:19:41,822
I am so glad that you have finally
remembered everything

1247
01:19:41,986 --> 01:19:44,656
because, you know,
with... without memory,

1248
01:19:44,822 --> 01:19:48,492
there can be no retribution.

1249
01:19:48,659 --> 01:19:50,739
Open up!

1250
01:19:50,911 --> 01:19:52,661
Shit.

1251
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:11,931
Ah.

1252
01:20:14,727 --> 01:20:16,597
- Lovely.
- No.

1253
01:20:18,897 --> 01:20:21,687
Now, are we finally ready?

1254
01:20:21,859 --> 01:20:24,069
Can we shoot this thing?

1255
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:25,946
Lights.

1256
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:33,084
- Camera.
- Toby.

1257
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:36,661
- Action.
- No.

1258
01:21:01,148 --> 01:21:03,608
No, Toby.

1259
01:22:05,629 --> 01:22:08,969
Help me, please!
Please help!

1260
01:22:09,133 --> 01:22:13,553
He's gonna kill me. This isn't a joke!

1261
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:17,010
- Help me! He's not kidding.
- Yes, yes, yes.

1262
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:18,992
- I was gonna kill the wench.
- Please, this is real!

1263
01:22:19,017 --> 01:22:20,907
- But not, dear friends...
- This isn't a joke! Please!

1264
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:22,576
- Without the approval...
- This isn't a joke!

1265
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:25,154
...and the approbation of you,
my audience.

1266
01:22:25,315 --> 01:22:28,605
- My heart, my soul...
- No!

1267
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:32,817
My sustenance.

1268
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:37,200
So, so, shall we kill her?

1269
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:41,329
Or, or shall we spare
this maiden?

1270
01:22:41,498 --> 01:22:43,668
- Toby, please stop!
- Show mercy

1271
01:22:43,834 --> 01:22:47,344
- to the tender virgin?
- Please, Toby, no!

1272
01:22:47,504 --> 01:22:49,094
No!

1273
01:22:49,256 --> 01:22:52,876
- No? No?
- No! He's going to kill me!

1274
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:05,020
Yes! Yes!

1275
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:06,729
All right, then.

1276
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:09,229
Then the fatal stroke shall fall

1277
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:12,401
exactly at the stroke of midnight.

1278
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:15,281
Shall we count it down together?
Thirty seconds to go.

1279
01:23:15,449 --> 01:23:16,489
Are you ready?

1280
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:20,577
All right! Thirty,

1281
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:23,916
29, 28,

1282
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:26,672
27, 26,
- No!

25, 24, 23,

1284
01:23:31,381 --> 01:23:34,631
22, 21, 20,
- Don't!

1285
01:23:34,801 --> 01:23:37,931
- Maggie!
- 19, 18,

1286
01:23:38,096 --> 01:23:40,806
17, 16,
- Mark!

1290
01:23:51,527 --> 01:23:54,947
six, five, four,
- Ah!

1291
01:23:55,113 --> 01:23:58,413
Three, two, one!

1292
01:24:05,082 --> 01:24:08,792
No! No, you're ruining it!

1293
01:24:13,924 --> 01:24:17,264
You'll ruin it!
No! No!

1294

1296

It's okay. It's okay.

1297
01:25:36,423 --> 01:25:38,263

in a little while, okay?
