1
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,160
In the heart of a
magical forrest...

2
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,280
...there exists of kingdom of
very small people.

3
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,720
Most of them
no better than your thumb.

4
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,040
For many years they lived...

5
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,000
...happily far from the
eyes of the outside world.

6
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,920
Until one day...

7
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,320
...a man came to the forrest
looking for...

8
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,040
...an usual creatures to display
in his travelling circus.

9
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,720
He discovered the peaceful kingdom
and could imagine the crowds...

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,440
...that would pay to see his
tiny new stars.

11
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,040
He crapped into the village
and stall two of the tiniest...

12
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,360
...inhabitants.
A boy and a girl.

13
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,720
Far outside the village
the boy managed to escape.

14
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,920
But the girl remained his prisoner.

15
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,160
With no memory of her past...

16
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,200
...the girl grow into a tiny
beautiful woman.

17
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,280
Thumbelina!

18
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,280
Thumbelina!

19
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,560
Thumbelina, wake up!

20
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,640
It's almost show time.

21
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,320
Time to sparkle!

22
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,080
One more show today.

23
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,400
Then, you can sleep
on your own time.

24
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,040
Get a move on!

25
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,800
Get a move on.

26
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,280
Pinheads

27
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,440
If you rejects
put half as much energy...

28
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,000
...into the show as you
do your downtime...

29
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,800
...you might be
good for something.

30
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,400
Easy, girl, just one more
show tonight.

31
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,400
Showtime!

32
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,840
I wanna see a chipper bunch
of rejects smiling ear-to-ear.

33
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,280
Ladies and Gentlemen.

34
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,520
Moppets of all ages!

35
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,080
Roman's Carnival of
Curiosity is proud...

36
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,680
...to present a
Cavalcade of Comedy...

37
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,200
...a Totality of Tomfoolery not
to mention reams of rejects!

38
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,520
It's positively cumbersome!

39
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,800
But I depress, presenting
the world's tiniest child...

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,760
...six inches of fun...

41
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,920
...the little girl who stands
the world on its rear...

42
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,920
...the one, the only, Thumbelina!

43
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,080
Well, here we go again.

44
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,560
Where did
the little girl come from?

45
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,840
Found her under a leaf.

46
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,480
One of life's little accidents...

47
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,680
...freak of nature.

48
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,480
Ladies and Gentlemen.

49
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,280
Have you ever in your days,
seen anything of this magnesium?

50
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,160
Thumbelina the Magnificent!

51
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,640
Doesn't she just burn your heart,
ladies and gentlemen.

52
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,040
No food for the chimp tonight!

53
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,680
Look at that hand!

54
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,040
Inflection could set
in at any moment.

55
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,600
Well, it could have been worse.

56
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,080
Warwick could have made a snack
of your elephantine proboscis.

57
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,160
That's true, I think.

58
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,960
You're growing up smart
and I don't like smart.

59
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,680
It irrigates me, you hear?!

60
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,120
I hear you, you're irrigated.

61
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,840
And Roman doesn't
like to be irrigated!

62
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,040
Who does?

63
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,360
Especially by one of
his little rejects.

64
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,960
I'm a reject.

65
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,320
There are other mice.

66
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,240
There are other monkeys.

67
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,600
There are even other pinheads.

68
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,600
But there's only one like me.

69
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,360
Only one me.

70
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,520
Only one.

71
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,080
I am all alone

72
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,320
Always on my own

73
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:08,240
There's nobody in
this whole wide world

74
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,600
For me to love

75
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,680
Always by myself

76
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,640
Stuck here on this shelf

77
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,160
Is there someone in
this whole wide world

78
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,040
For me to love?

79
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,080
For Thumbelina to love?

80
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,760
And even though, I'm smart as this

81
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,960
It happens I have lips to kiss

82
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,680
A hand to hold

83
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:02,680
A heart that breaks
in two or maybe three

84
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,840
Will someone ever

85
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,320
Notice

86
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,560
Me?

87
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,720
I am all alone

88
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,840
Always on my own

89
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,800
Is there someone in this

90
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,640
Whole wide world

91
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,120
For me to love?

92
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,520
For Thumbelina

93
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,720
To love?

94
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,000
There's no one anywhere
in this world like me.

95
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,240
No one.

96
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,920
Let me have a wrench, will ya?

97
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,040
Thanks, Ben.

98
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,760
Come on.

99
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,160
Can you fix it, Boy?

100
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,120
Piece of...

101
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,760
Alright, start her up!

102
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,400
Ben, do you think
I'm short for my age?

103
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,440
That's hard to say, Tom?

104
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,720
Since there's nothing to
compare me to, you mean?

105
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,480
Better to be an original
than a copy.

106
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,560
- What's that?
- What's what?

107
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,200
You always were a sucker
for that one.

108
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,440
Listen, always be prepared
for any eventuality, kid.

109
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,840
You tell him.

110
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,360
I'm not gonna tell him.

111
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,240
What about Muscles here?

112
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,560
I just don't think my nerves
could survive a confrontation.

113
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,120
Oh, let's draw straws.

114
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,400
Hey, loosen up there, will ya?

115
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,880
I always lose this stupid game.

116
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,960
Here comes Roman?

117
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,080
What have we got here?

118
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,920
Looks like a reject
unemployment line.

119
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,320
Which it could very
well be very soon.

120
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,920
You got something on your
mind, Pinhead?

121
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,960
What about you, Tiny?

122
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,000
You thinking about anything
besides your next meal?

123
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,960
How about you, Brawn for Brains?

124
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,760
Well, as a matter of fact, sir,
we were just chatting and...

125
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,040
Get to the point.

126
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,040
Thumbelina has
something to say to you.

127
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,440
So, what have you got to tell me?

128
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,640
We think... I think
you should feed the monkey.

129
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,400
There's a lot of thinking
going on around here...

130
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,720
...and none of it wise.

131
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,240
So Little Miss Ugly
wants to feed the monkey.

132
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,440
Well, maybe I'll feed him you.

133
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,320
Put me down!

134
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,440
Put me down!

135
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,400
Put me down!

136
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,360
Put me down!

137
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,560
Thanks for the ride, pal.

138
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,000
This is the place...

139
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,520
...isn't it, Ben?

140
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,280
Yep.

141
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,680
This is where I found you, kid.

142
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,400
It was after I first
took the act on the road.

143
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,960
I was camped for the night.
Right where we find ourselves now.

144
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,600
I had just nodded
off when I heard a sound.

145
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,480
At first,
I thought I was dreaming...

146
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,320
...but the dogs they heard it, too.

147
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,800
It was the sound of voices...

148
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,240
...hundreds of voices,
tiny voices screaming.

149
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,560
It chilled me clean through...

150
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,240
...one of the dogs saw something.

151
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,760
They got good eyes, dogs do.

152
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,320
Then, I saw it, too.

153
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,240
Something was running towards me.

154
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,720
Something small.

155
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,920
Me?

156
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,440
You weren't more than a toddler
at the time I picked you up...

157
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,080
...and, well, you
fell right asleep.

158
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,200
Children will do that you know.

159
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,360
Growing up, I always felt like
I was the only one like me.

160
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,880
But lately you've been feeling
that there might be others?

161
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,920
And that maybe...

162
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,200
...I don't know.

163
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,280
There might be somebody special.

164
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,000
I think that it may be time
for you to strike out and...

165
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,320
...try to find that somebody.

166
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,120
That's why I brought you here.

167
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,000
You see, Tom.

168
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,760
I'm going to be
moving on soon, too.

169
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,840
And where I'm going, well...

170
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,440
...you can't be coming	 with me.

171
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,400
I've had some good years...

172
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,240
...and many of them.
The best since I found you.

173
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,880
But there comes a time
when everybody's gotta move on.

174
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,600
For you it's called growing up.

175
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,680
For me...

176
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,600
...well...

177
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,040
If you like the company of rodents
and chimps, better than people...

178
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,760
...you can ride with them.

179
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,920
No!

180
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,960
No! Please, no!

181
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,160
I can take everything away, kid.

182
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,640
Even the light!

183
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,760
No, I don't like the dark.
I'm afraid.

184
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,080
Go ahead. Tell her what you heard.

185
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,160
When Roman was hitching
up the horses...

186
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,720
...he told one of the drivers
that we're near the place...

187
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,720
...where he found you years ago.

188
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,480
He said there were others
like you that night but...

189
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,800
...you were the only one he could
catch because you were just a baby.

190
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,400
There are others...

191
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,920
...others like me?

192
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,600
I may be small but I am not
going to be small here any longer.

193
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,800
If there are others like me, then,
then there's someplace I belong...

194
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,240
...and I can find it!

195
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,080
Whoa!

196
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,800
I think I can.

197
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,040
I know I can!

198
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,760
There are some clothes
in there, some food...

199
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,160
...and a compass.

200
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,200
That should be everything you need.

201
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,960
I wish I knew how to thank you.

202
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,600
You've been like a
father to me, Ben.

203
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,360
You don't have to thank me, kid.

204
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,120
You've given me more than I ever...

205
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,760
...thought I'd have.

206
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,200
I was wrong.

207
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,760
You are my father.

208
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,160
I love you Ben.

209
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,840
That's a tear for good luck. Tom!

210
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,880
Good-bye fellas.

211
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,400
Better get a move on, boy.

212
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,920
That was close.

213
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,320
Watch it.

214
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,680
I'm still back here, you know!

215
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,600
It'll be okay.

216
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,680
Don't look down.

217
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,400
Don't look down, it'll be okay.

218
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,480
Good Luck! We'll miss you!

219
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,800
I'll miss you.

220
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,280
It's freezing.

221
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,560
Didn't anybody ever tell you
that it's not polite to stare?

222
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,040
Didn't anybody ever tell you
that it's not polite to stare?

223
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,800
I've never seen anything like it!

224
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,200
It only has two arms!

225
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,160
Well, it looks like pond sludge.

226
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,280
Let's take it home to Mother.

227
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,400
I saw it first!

228
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,320
You thought it was pond sludge!

229
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,800
Well, now that I look closer,
I see that it's defective.

230
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,440
No antenna.
How can it feel without an antenna?

231
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,000
We don't want something
that can't feel.

232
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,720
I can feel quite well,
thank you very much!

233
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,760
A Biped no less!

234
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,240
You are talking about me
as if I'm not even here!

235
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,840
Stop it!

236
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
- Touchy!
- Touchy!

237
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,960
Petulant, little thing!

238
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,040
Let it be Bertha,
it's not in our class.

239
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,560
I am not an it! I'm a she!

240
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,840
And she is leaving!

241
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,280
Maybe with discipline,
she could be house-trained?

242
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,120
Could we stand to look at her...

243
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,480
...day after day,
that's my question?

244
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,720
She's so ugly.

245
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,960
Let's see what Mummy thinks?

246
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,160
Yes, let's let Mummy
decide if we should keep her.

247
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,360
I'm not going anywhere with you!

248
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,080
It's not up to you or
anybody to keep me.

249
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,600
Not anymore.

250
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,200
I'm on my own!

251
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,960
With that attitude,
you'll always be on your own!

252
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,360
Get away! You don't belong here!

253
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,400
- You don't belong anywhere!
- You don't belong anywhere!

254
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,760
- You don't belong anywhere!
- You don't belong anywhere!

255
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,480
Maybe they're right.

256
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,160
What do you see, Godfrey,
what do you see?

257
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,280
The usual, Daniel, the usual.

258
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,760
The usual insects, amphibians,
indigenous plant life.

259
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,320
Raccoon guano.

260
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,560
A tiny girl floating in a
sardine can.

261
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,320
A tiny girl floating in a
sardine can?

262
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,440
What do you think, Godfrey
what do you think?

263
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,400
Me thinks the Boss shall
soon be singing our praises.

264
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,920
I love it when he sings.

265
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,840
What do you say, Godfrey?
What do you say?

266
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,800
Should we tell him now?

267
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,040
Good news.

268
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,560
Like your reddish wines...

269
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,720
...should be allowed to age,
Daniel.

270
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,000
There's plenty of time to tell him.

271
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,680
Tell him what?

272
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,080
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

273
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,920
Who's speaking?

274
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,040
It's your humble servant,
Godfrey, your Majesty.

275
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,240
Captain of the Guards.
- And Daniel.

276
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,280
Your Master of Hounds.

277
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,760
You have news for me?

278
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,840
- Excellent news!
- Fantastic news!

279
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,480
Unprecedented news!

280
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,080
Glorious news!

281
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,080
Out with it already!

282
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,120
We've just seen the most
beautiful creature in the forest.

283
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,480
Stunning. Lovely!

284
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,320
I've wanted a queen
for a long time.

285
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,120
A Kingdom isn't properly
accessorized without one.

286
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,800
This girl has got 'Queen'
written all over her!

287
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,320
Where, where, where is
this divine creature?

288
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,280
Are my chamber maids
preparing her for an audience?

289
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,280
You do have her don't you?

290
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,480
You know,
I don't like to be disappointed.

291
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,720
It makes me disagreeable!

292
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,800
And when I'm disagreeable,
I wouldn't want to be you!

293
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,880
She's on her way. Really.

294
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,920
Very anxious to meet you, she is.

295
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,920
Very anxious.

296
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,040
She wanted to look her best.
You know...

297
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,840
She's...

298
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,080
She's primping!

299
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,400
Then, I must look my best as well.

300
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,160
Where is my... I need my crown!

301
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,520
The crown always impresses...

302
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,280
Where is that maid?

303
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,160
Yes, where is that maid?

304
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,000
Gertrude! We're waiting!

305
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:01,120
Beg pardon, sire,
I was polishing your crown.

306
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,480
I must share this news with
my loyal subjects.

307
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,120
Captain of the Guards!
Summon my minions.

308
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,440
Yes, your Majesty.

309
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,760
All Moles assemble
in the Throne Room.

310
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,480
Immediately!

311
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,120
Mergatroid, how good to see you.

312
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,320
- Boris, looking swell.
- Gordon, how's the wife?

313
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,120
- Francis, nice hat.
- Snickelfritz.

314
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,480
- Good to see you again.
- Millie are those new roller-skates?

315
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,520
- Hello Barbara.
- Barnett!

316
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,280
- Guys! It's been ages.
- You're looking slim.

317
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,720
Lincoln, Washington,
nice to see you boys.

318
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,480
Quiet!

319
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,320
Everyone, listen up.

320
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,440
We're gonna have to
tell him someday.

321
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,720
Tell him what?

322
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,080
That everybody's deserted him?
You know the old coot's temper.

323
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,240
I want my minions to make
ready a celebration, you see...

324
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,680
...I'm taking a bride.

325
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,080
- Way to go!
- Atta way to go, your Highness!

326
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,920
You'll look great in tails.

327
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,120
She comes to us highly recommended.

328
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,440
I'm certain you will serve her
as you have served me.

329
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,520
And now,
I must prepare to meet my bride.

330
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,840
She arrives at any moment.

331
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,080
Doesn't she?

332
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,760
- In a jiffy.
- In a jiffy.

333
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,360
What do you think that was Godfrey,
what do you think that was?

334
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,400
There's another one! A boy.

335
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,640
I hope there's nothing serious
between them.

336
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,120
Don't run away from me!

337
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,400
Hey! What the...

338
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,760
What are you?

339
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,920
"I'm not a 'what', I'm a 'who'.

340
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,240
Like... like you.

341
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,160
You are, aren't you?

342
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,920
Like me.

343
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,840
Where did you come from?

344
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,800
What are you doing here?

345
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,080
I'm on a journey to find
other little people like myself.

346
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,240
That's exactly
what I'm looking for!

347
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,440
Wow, I've never met
anybody like me before.

348
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,720
Me neither!

349
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,720
Where are you from?

350
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,480
I...

351
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,360
I don't know.

352
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,120
Neither do I!

353
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,040
I do remember one thing.

354
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,200
One word. From my past.

355
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,440
Horse.

356
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,040
Horse?

357
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,160
Go figure. I probably dreamed it.

358
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,200
But Ben told me,
I definitely came from someplace.

359
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,400
Who's Ben?

360
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,840
He raised me.

361
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,880
- Was he big?
- The biggest.

362
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,480
And the kindest.

363
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,120
Who raised you?

364
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,120
I wasn't exactly raised.
I was incarcerated.

365
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,960
But that's all in the past.

366
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,200
I am on my own now.

367
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,600
Well...

368
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,320
...I was thinking
that since well...

369
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,760
...we seem to be looking
for the same thing.

370
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,640
Maybe we could be
on our own together.

371
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,600
I...

372
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,160
I would like that very much.

373
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,680
You see, Mummy, we told you!

374
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,840
Oh no!

375
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,200
Did we exaggerate, Mummy?

376
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,280
It looks like pond sludge.

377
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,680
My words exactly!

378
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,600
The short one's sort a cute.

379
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,760
At least he's male.

380
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,520
Let's just ignore them.

381
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,040
Ben says if you ignore something,
it goes away.

382
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,880
Yeah, we can ignore them but
they won't go away! Trust me!

383
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,480
Stop that! I'm serious!

384
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:53,920
If you're so serious, Smarty,
why are you wearing that?

385
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,840
It probably doesn't
even have a name.

386
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,520
I do have a name.

387
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,000
It's Thumbelina!

388
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,400
That's the dumbest name
I've ever heard!

389
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,840
Well, you have to admit,
it's a pretty silly name.

390
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,360
And what's your name?

391
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,320
Tom.

392
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,960
Tom...

393
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,600
I didn't catch that.

394
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,280
Tom Thumb.

395
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,440
Okay? Thumb.

396
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,200
And my name's silly?

397
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,360
Tell me, Tom Thumb.

398
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,920
Do you think all little people
are as short as you?

399
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,960
I don't know, Thumbelina.

400
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,840
And I don't know if they're
all as rude as you!

401
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,320
- What are you staring at?
- What are you staring at?

402
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,240
Between you and me, Tom.

403
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,200
I don't think there's
magic in this relationship.

404
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,200
Well, we don't really
have a relationship.

405
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,120
Terrific!

406
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,440
I suggest ditching the beanpole.

407
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,000
It's all for the best.

408
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:10,480
Have you met my daughters?

409
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,960
I guess I'll say goodbye then.

410
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,480
Fine!
That's just how I want it too!

411
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,480
Thumbelina!

412
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,080
Wait up!

413
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,240
Where are your friends?

414
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,720
They are not my friends.

415
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,040
You're my friend.

416
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,400
I am?

417
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,200
Sure you are.

418
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,840
Look, I...

419
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,760
We... we've never met
anyone like us.

420
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,200
You, me.

421
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,560
You know?

422
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,800
I know.

423
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,880
I, I guess we have some things
to learn about each other.

424
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,520
You know?

425
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,320
So maybe, if you want to,
we could learn about each other...

426
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,160
...together.

427
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,640
I guess she'd rather be
on her own after all.

428
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,720
My little darling.

429
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,040
Welcome to my palace.

430
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,720
So soft.

431
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:45,200
So shy, so fragrant!

432
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,520
Thanks so much.

433
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,120
Send in the chambermaid
on your way out.

434
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,680
We need to prepare
a hole for our guest.

435
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,600
That really isn't necessary.

436
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,440
I won't be requiring a hole.
I can't stay.

437
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,360
And so witty.

438
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,160
I was the chambermaid last time.

439
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,920
And you did it so well.

440
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,880
The snood suits you.

441
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,880
I thought it was a nice touch.

442
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,000
We'll have a huge wedding,
sparing no expense.

443
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,120
All my subjects will
be in attendance.

444
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,640
We'll invite everyone
in the forest.

445
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,520
Everyone I haven't terrorized,
banished or imprisoned.

446
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,760
As for those I've eliminated, they
won't know what they're missing!

447
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,440
Look,
this is all very flattering but...

448
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,040
...well, there's someone else.

449
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,160
Nonsense.

450
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,760
Whomever it is could not
possibly compare with me!

451
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,200
I shall woo you.

452
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,240
You'll come to love me.

453
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,920
You haven't heard me sing?

454
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,200
I know all the words to
'Auld Lang Syne'...

455
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,840
...and I know what they mean.

456
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,960
I can perform the tenor and the
baritone parts in the "Ring" cycle.

457
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,920
Simultaneously!

458
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,560
And you haven't lived
until you've seen my...

459
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,360
...Richard the Third.

460
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,200
Welcome to my hole

461
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,520
Welcome to my kingdom, here

462
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,520
I'm a whole lot of man
You gotta fight off if you can

463
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,400
Welcome to my throne

464
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,920
Please try on my ermine

465
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,440
Is it cuz, I'm vermin

466
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,200
You recoil from my touch

467
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,760
Is it cuz I'm vermin
You don't smile very much

468
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,720
Is it cuz I'm vermin
You don't think that I'm droll

469
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,520
Welcome to my dolls, to my crown,
to my ermine, to my town

470
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,120
Welcome to my, welcome to my hole

471
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,880
You and I

472
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,040
We make music

473
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,320
I could cry

474
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,080
Cuz I'm so happy that
you're so lovely

475
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,080
You're so little,
and you're so sweet

476
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,720
And that you have such little,
little, little, little, feet

477
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,840
I repeat, welcome to my hole

478
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,160
Welcome to this lovely place

479
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,880
Do you like my face? or my nose?

480
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,640
I suppose they're
disgusting but they're me

481
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,800
How about my clothes?

482
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,680
Please do not be catty

483
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,960
Is it cuz I'm ratty?

484
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,800
You don't smile when I smile

485
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,240
Is it cuz I'm ratty
You won't walk down the aisle

486
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,840
Is it cuz I'm ratty
That you heat me like a troll

487
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,480
Welcome to my,
welcome to my dolls, my crown

488
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,920
Welcome, welcome, welcome
to my own little town

489
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,480
Welcome to my,
welcome to my books, to my rugs

490
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,080
To my kisses, to my hugs

491
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,240
Welcome to my hole

492
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,760
You and I

493
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,600
We make music

494
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,800
I could cry

495
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,560
Cuz I'm so happy, that you're
so lovely, and you're so little

496
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,880
And you're so sweet

497
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,000
And that you have such little,
little, little feet

498
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,200
- He can tell a joke
- I can tell a joke

499
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,200
I can while you with my wit

500
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,400
Any place you sit I'll sit and I'll
charm you like a teenager in love

501
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,680
- We're a perfect fit
- We're a perfect fit

502
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,680
I am not a nitwit

503
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,280
That's because royal

504
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,360
And it's you I adore, you're a
lovely goil who is destine for more

505
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,840
I won't let you spoil,
what you're meaning to spoil

506
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,920
I'm just a mole
Welcome to my hole!

507
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,720
Welcome to my hole!

508
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,760
Welcome to my hole!

509
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,640
Ever wonder where all
those missing socks go to?

510
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,520
It's my little joke on the world.

511
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,960
You desired.

512
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,680
You desired me, your Majesty?

513
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,120
I want you to find the
most elaborate, desirable...

514
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,760
...comfortable hole in my kingdom.

515
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,160
Make it ready for my Queen.
For Queen...

516
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,360
I don't know your name, my dear.

517
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,640
Thumbelina.

518
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,800
Well, we'll have to do
something about that.

519
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,520
Prepare the wedding!
- Don't I have a say in this?

520
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,440
Of course not!

521
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,360
We'll have a wonderful
life together.

522
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,960
I insist!

523
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,240
I think he's awfully dreamy,
really.

524
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,400
And I would love so very dearly,
if you would like...

525
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,920
A little fiber for you.

526
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,680
Taste it, it's ever so juicy!

527
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,760
Yeah, give me that, give me that.
Your shoe.

528
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,680
Hey, where'd you find this?

529
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,040
You twit!

530
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,720
That belongs to the beanpole!

531
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,960
Where did you find it?

532
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,040
Around.

533
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,800
Around here?!

534
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
There!

535
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,400
Oh no.

536
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,280
I have to go after her!

537
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,720
She's everything I ever dreamed of!

538
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,800
Great work, Morons!

539
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,840
If you had just listened to me
everything...

540
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,840
Well, what miracle has brought
about this most welcome silence?

541
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,440
Take your pick.

542
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,840
These are my best holes.

543
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,120
Well, a choice is so difficult.

544
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,720
They're all very, very nice holes.

545
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,440
Have you found a hole
that pleases you my love?

546
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,640
I think so.

547
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,440
What are you in for?

548
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,200
He wants to marry me.

549
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,680
Untie me fast.

550
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,280
That's a fate worse than death.

551
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,840
What are you in for?

552
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,520
I have no idea.

553
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,040
Godfrey, Daniel.

554
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,240
What's on the menu for
my engagement dinner?

555
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,720
Your favorite! Sparrow Quiche.

556
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,400
Faster!

557
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,000
Where are you my love?

558
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,720
Thumbelina?

559
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,040
Thumbelina?

560
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,800
Pumpkin.

561
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,160
Are you playing hide and seek?

562
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,400
The Mole King doesn't like games.

563
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,040
Thumbelina!

564
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,200
Thumbelina!

565
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,120
Once we're outta here,
head straight for the skies!

566
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,560
One problem.

567
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,800
I can't fly!

568
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,360
What?

569
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,080
Godfrey!

570
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,800
Daniel!

571
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,520
But every bird knows how to fly,
it's instinctual.

572
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,920
The moles captured me...

573
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,600
...right after I fell outta my
nest as a chick. I never learned.

574
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,360
I have two words for you.

575
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,280
Sparrow Quiche.

576
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,040
But I'm a very quick study.

577
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,560
She's left me!

578
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,880
My Queen is A.W.O.L.!

579
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,080
Bring her back!

580
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,480
Tout de suite!

581
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,800
Understood?

582
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,080
I'm not certain I
grasp the French...

583
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,680
...but I'm with you on
the general meaning.

584
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,800
- Understood!
- Understood!

585
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,120
Hurry! Moles at six o'clock!

586
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,320
Hold tight! We're almost there.

587
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,440
Almost there.

588
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,400
Almost.

589
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,480
What do we do now, Godfrey?

590
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,760
What do we do now?

591
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,120
Prudence demands a hasty retreat.

592
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,680
I'm with Prudence.

593
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,160
I'm sure I'll acquire aerial
expertise sooner or later.

594
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,040
We're safe now!

595
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,600
But I don't have
any idea were we are.

596
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,640
I have to find Tom.

597
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,240
- Who's Tom?
- He's my...

598
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,760
My friend.

599
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,280
After what we've been through,
you can smile?

600
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,800
It, it's just that I
like the way it sounds.

601
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,800
You know,
I've never said it before.

602
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,280
My friend.

603
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,640
It feels good.

604
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,880
What's the matter?

605
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,120
I thought we were friends.

606
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,320
We just shared a very dangerous
moment back there!

607
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,040
Yeah, that we did and
I'm very grateful to you.

608
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,280
- You are?
- I am.

609
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,760
My friend.

610
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,760
My name's Albertine.

611
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,320
Mine's Thurnbelina.

612
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,160
I know.

613
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,080
It's a silly name.

614
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,440
Nothing can hurt us now.

615
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,400
We're friends.

616
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,080
We're safe.

617
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,160
We're friends.

618
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,080
We're in a lot of trouble!

619
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,760
Run! Run for your life!

620
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,440
Help!

621
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,640
Help!

622
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,840
My friend.

623
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,920
There's not enough air.

624
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,960
We're all gonna die!

625
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,400
- Thumbelina!
- Tom!

626
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,160
Are you alright?

627
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,400
It's that girl.

628
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,080
I know she was bad news!

629
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,240
This is all your fault!

630
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,680
Look, explain to me...

631
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,160
...how all this
could possibly be my fault?

632
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,160
- Some things just are!
- Some things just are!

633
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,520
The colors of this one.

634
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,760
Look,
there's nothing to worry about.

635
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,040
He looks like a good kid.

636
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,000
He won't hurt us.

637
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,120
- Mommy!
- Mommy!

638
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,200
What is she doing?

639
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,680
I've got a plan.

640
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,160
That's the girl of my dreams.

641
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,360
About to become the girl
of your memories.

642
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,720
It pains me to say I told you so.

643
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,600
But when I'm right, I'm right.

644
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,360
Come closer.

645
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,680
You can talk!

646
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:07,800
Barely.

647
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,560
Barely. I'm fading fast.

648
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,960
Closer.

649
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,200
Sweet dreams, kid!

650
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,120
I always said you were special.

651
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,400
Yeah!

652
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,840
Mummy! Bravo!

653
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,400
Oh, my goodness!

654
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,920
Oh, please help us.

655
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,840
Pull me up!

656
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,320
- Put your arms into it girls!
- I'm doing the best I can.

657
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,360
What do you say we get outta here?

658
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,240
Wait a sec.

659
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,840
Okay, everybody.

660
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,640
C'mon, hurry up!

661
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,320
Hurry up, you're free!

662
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,280
Thanks, sister!

663
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,640
Why'd you do that?

664
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,600
I know how they feel.

665
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,640
We're on the ground now.

666
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,480
You can let me go.

667
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,720
Yeah, sorry.

668
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,640
Thanks for deep-sixing the kid,
missy!

669
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,040
Yeah, thanks muchly!

670
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,600
They're here!

671
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,680
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

672
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,000
Hey, hang on there.

673
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,360
I hereby proclaim a celebration...

674
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,400
...in honor of our two new
friends and their heroic deed.

675
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,560
There's gonna be some
dancing and singing and...

676
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,600
Avocado Ice Cream!

677
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,600
We love avocado ice cream!

678
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,960
Is there room for three more?

679
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,600
I want that girl.

680
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,520
Not just something
that smells like her!

681
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,960
Find her!

682
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,960
You can help peel the avocado.

683
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,640
- Great.
- It's a three-man job.

684
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,960
They're slippery suckers!

685
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,880
Oh, my goodness!

686
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,520
Here it is.

687
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,160
Oh, no, no, no.
Where to start?

688
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,080
Where to start?

689
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,720
A bath certainly!

690
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,480
A trim, most definitely.

691
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,840
A party, you say.

692
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,240
And there's another man
in the picture?

693
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,400
Regrettably, yes.

694
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:21,200
He's got nothin' on you in the
looks department, if you ask me.

695
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,080
I must demonstrate that
I'm the better catch.

696
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:27,240
I must woo her anew.
I must show her the best of me...

697
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,160
...and if that should fail...

698
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,000
...I'll simply dismember
the competition.

699
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,120
That's fair, don't you think?

700
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,480
- More than fair.
- Yes!

701
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,000
Call my handmaidens at once.

702
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,040
I need my cape, my dancing shoes.

703
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,480
I'm stepping out!

704
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,080
I'm almost ready.

705
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,360
Where's the other one?

706
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,120
Leola, it's me.

707
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,800
Thumbelina. It's me.

708
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,760
Thumbelina!

709
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,840
Can't be.

710
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:04,200
Why, baby, you're the loveliest
thing I've ever seen.

711
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,360
So pretty.

712
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,920
I'm pretty?

713
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,320
No one has ever
brushed hair before.

714
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:20,360
No one's ever,
ever hugged me before.

715
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,200
And I guess I just didn't
know what it would feel like.

716
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,360
And how does it feel, baby?

717
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,800
Wonderful.

718
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,080
Whoa!

719
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,080
- What a babe!
- What a babe!

720
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,640
Well, that one's a goner, girls.

721
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:02,080
Fan out and snare
yourself a rodent.

722
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,800
C'mon, move out!

723
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,920
Albertine!

724
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,360
Thumbelina!

725
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,560
I've been on your trail all day.

726
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,040
Just as I think you're in
one place, you're in another.

727
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,400
Is that Tom?

728
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,360
Now I know everything
is going to be alright.

729
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,320
All my friends are here.

730
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,680
You mean you don't know how to fly?

731
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,560
To work, girls, to work.

732
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,440
Look Thumbelina.

733
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,880
I'm sorry we got into that fight.

734
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,800
Those fight.

735
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,720
It was my fault, too.

736
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:08,040
It'll be different tomorrow
when we set out to find home.

737
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,880
What happens if we get
there and you find somebody...

738
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,400
...taller?

739
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,760
You'll see. I'm still
looking for home.

740
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,560
But not somebody taller.

741
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,840
I sort of found my home
when I found you.

742
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,600
You...

743
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,280
You are my dream.

744
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,680
And you're a big part of mine.

745
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,840
But I can't stop until the dream
I've dreamed for so long...

746
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,240
...is complete.

747
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,440
Until I've found that place where
I feel I really, truly belong.

748
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,840
Can we look for it together?

749
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,400
Yes. You know...

750
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:41,320
...for the first time in my life...

751
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:45,560
...I don't feel like a,
like a reject.

752
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,880
I never really thought
there could be anybody like me.

753
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,840
And you were right about that.

754
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,480
There is nobody like you,
Thumbelina.

755
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,960
One day, it happens

756
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:01,160
I turn and see the lady who
certainly will change my life

757
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:04,080
It happens one day

758
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:09,520
And one day the birds will sing

759
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:12,200
The trees and everything

760
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,600
Will go one, two, cha, cha, cha

761
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,120
One, two, cha, cha

762
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:20,240
And one day, and instantly

763
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,240
The fuzzy-wuzzy bumblebee will go

764
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,560
One, two, cha, cha, cha

765
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:25,880
One, two, cha, cha

766
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,320
And one day

767
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,640
One day

768
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,880
Out comes the sun

769
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,200
The mice,
the geese and everyone will go

770
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,600
One, two, cha, cha, cha

771
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,920
One, two, cha, cha, cha

772
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,440
One, two, cha, cha, cha

773
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,280
One, two, cha, cha, cha

774
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,040
One, two, cha, cha, cha

775
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,640
One, two, cha, cha, cha

776
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:52,960
On this beautiful day

777
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,520
I'm waiting.

778
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,760
Wait no more!

779
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,240
Hello.

780
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,600
Guess who?

781
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,920
I guess you could say
I'm dressed to kill.

782
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,960
I love a good cha-cha-cha!

783
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,680
I said I love a good cha-cha-cha!

784
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:45,520
May I?

785
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,280
I'll lead.

786
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,000
Let him go!

787
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,160
Is he your little friend?

788
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,200
Pathetic!

789
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,720
He certainly was a goofy dancer!

790
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,360
Can't hold a candle to your
hoofing, your majesty!

791
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,040
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!" Look out for the...

792
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,000
Thumbelina!

793
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,240
Oh, moles!

794
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,520
I can't have lost her!

795
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,280
Thumbelina!

796
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:36,240
Was ever woman in this humor wooed?

797
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,280
Was ever woman in this humor won?

798
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,800
Not on your life!

799
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,320
You are going to be my Queen.

800
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,480
And this time,
I am taking no chances.

801
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,680
My minions are blocking
off all avenues of escape.

802
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,720
This is your home.

803
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,560
Forever!

804
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,080
I'll get away. I always do.

805
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,920
I've managed to extricate myself
from more venal pigs than you!

806
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,360
More venal? Maybe.

807
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:02,680
More clever?

808
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,080
More inspired?

809
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,040
I don't think so.

810
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,800
You see, I have a little
insurance this time.

811
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,240
Your tiny friend, Tom,
is also my prisoner.

812
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,800
Cloistered safely at least so far.

813
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,520
In another section of my lair.

814
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:19,000
But you see, there aren't enough
permanent holes for two of you.

815
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,240
Marry me, and I'll see
that no harm comes to him.

816
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:34,760
Alright.

817
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,720
I'll marry you.

818
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,960
You've made me so happy.

819
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,000
Godfrey, Daniel.

820
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,880
Prepare the wedding!

821
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,800
I can't let anything
happen to you Tom.

822
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,760
I can't.
I don't care what happens to me.

823
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,800
Tom.

824
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,000
The moles have blacked all tunnels.

825
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,280
There's no way down.

826
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,760
There is one.

827
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,640
It's a half day's
journey from here.

828
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:07,920
Let's go!

829
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:09,760
Wait a sec!

830
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,800
How do you know about this hole?

831
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,040
I just know. That's all.

832
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,400
Come clean, sister!

833
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:20,480
How do you know where
the Mole King lives?

834
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,040
I used to date the guy, okay?

835
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,400
When I was young. I was lonely.

836
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,240
Alright?

837
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,920
Thumbelina saved me once.

838
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,840
Now, I can repay her.

839
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,640
Climb aboard.

840
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,040
I really don't like to fly.

841
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,560
That's okay.

842
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,240
Neither do I!

843
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,720
That is so reassuring.

844
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,760
There! First hole to the
left of the escarpment!

845
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,520
Hang on!

846
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:03,760
I haven't completely
perfected my landing skills!

847
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,280
"I haven't completely
perfected my landing skills!"

848
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,480
Landing skills!

849
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,160
Okay. Listen up you two.

850
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:20,680
I've got a plan.

851
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,680
As long as it doesn't
involve air travel!

852
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,640
Why do you stay?

853
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,880
He's horrible to you.

854
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:35,000
Yeah, he may be a fascist! But...

855
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,360
...he's our fascist!
- He's our fascist!

856
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,040
We're scared of the guy.

857
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:40,240
And well...

858
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,960
We don't have anywhere else to go!

859
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,440
I was frightened once.

860
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,480
And I thought I didn't
have anywhere to go.

861
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,000
But I got away.

862
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,600
Yeah, and look where you ended up!

863
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,160
In a dark hole,
engaged to a rank mole.

864
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,560
I got away once.
And I can get away again!

865
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,560
The King's got you for good...

866
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:01,240
...and if you're smart,
you'll play it cool.

867
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,200
You haven't seen the King
really angry.

868
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:07,160
- You could lose inch on the hem.
- Godfrey, Daniel.

869
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,360
My bride!

870
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,000
Now!

871
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,440
I do.

872
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,480
I can.

873
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:27,320
I always cry at weddings.

874
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,160
Before this day is over...

875
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,480
...I hope to give you
something to really cry about.

876
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:42,520
We gathered here today to
join this Mole and this woman...

877
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:43,800
...in holy matrimony.

878
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,800
If there be any mole among you
that know of any cause...

879
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,480
...why these two
cannot be joined...

880
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:50,880
...let him or her speak or
forever hold his peace.

881
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,520
I thought not! Your Majesty...

882
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,920
...do you take this woman...

883
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:00,240
I'll give you a reason why this
woman can't marry this mole!

884
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,280
Who dares to interrupt?

885
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,640
I dare.

886
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,440
Thumbelina loves me.

887
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:06,800
I think.

888
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,040
Minions! After him!

889
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,360
I'm still here!

890
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,080
Minions?

891
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,840
Decimate him!

892
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,560
Minions?
There are only two guys here!

893
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:23,080
Two guys!
You don't have any minions.

894
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,360
Look!

895
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,000
I can see.

896
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,320
I can see.

897
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,440
How beautiful you are!

898
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,040
I can see how short you are.

899
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,080
I can see.

900
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:41,880
I can see two moles!

901
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:47,080
Two very unlucky moles!

902
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:50,000
I plead insanity, your Majesty?

903
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:54,280
I can see some changes are
going to have to be made!

904
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:58,000
The only change that's going to be
made is the identity of the groom.

905
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,400
That's not the change
I have in mind.

906
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:04,040
This is my sandbox
and you can't play!

907
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,600
I am not in the giving vein today!

908
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,560
Come with me, my sweet.

909
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,600
Let go of me!

910
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,560
Get your hands off me.

911
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Stop!

912
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:20,480
Disgusting! Let go of me! Let go!

913
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,240
Wait!

914
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,040
Your Highness!

915
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,720
Your Majesty!

916
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:47,760
Not so fast fur balls!

917
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:51,160
First, you've got to
deal with Mama Leola!

918
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:54,680
You see,
I plan for every contingency.

919
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,680
That's what makes me regal!

920
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:01,680
Please, no.

921
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,080
No, I... I'm afraid of the dark.

922
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,720
Oh, you'll come to love it as I do.

923
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,240
We don't need light.

924
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,520
We don't need anything.

925
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,200
We have each other.

926
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:17,560
Now and for always in my kingdom
of perpetual night!

927
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,600
We're so alike,
my little Thumbelina.

928
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,040
Both of us, rejects.

929
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,720
I'm proud to be one.

930
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:31,000
You'll grow to
accept being one too.

931
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,280
I am not a reject!

932
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:47,040
Wait, pumpkin!

933
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:50,760
Your king commands you to stay!

934
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:56,080
Oh, so wise, so young,
they say, do never live long!

935
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:57,720
Guess again!

936
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,240
No!

937
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:19,840
Thus far into the
bowels of the land...

938
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:22,560
...have we marched on
without impediment!

939
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,120
Dig straight up.

940
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,280
Here!

941
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:33,920
C'mon!

942
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,600
Know what to do?

943
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:52,840
Get that mouse!

944
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,680
Where's the love?

945
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,040
Trust me?

946
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:08,960
- I do!
- You do?

947
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,560
Yes, I'm that kind of girl!

948
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,920
No!

949
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,840
Godfrey! Daniel!

950
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:31,800
You are in such trouble.

951
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:38,320
He always like a good exit.

952
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:41,840
What do we do now Godfrey,
what do we do now?

953
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:47,760
This looks like it might just be
my size!

954
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:48,960
Your size?

955
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:51,440
If you think for one minute that
you're gonna be the new King...

956
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:54,000
...after I spent all that
time dressing up as maids...

957
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,320
...and ladies-in-waiting
and things...

958
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,920
...you're outta your mind! Gimme!
- Give me!

959
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:10,600
It's not over yet.

960
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,600
She still has to land!

961
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,480
I don't think I can.

962
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,120
You can!

963
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,160
Hey look, man! Albertine!

964
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:22,680
Down!

965
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:24,680
Bravo Albertine!

966
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:37,000
It's okay. I see a spot to land.

967
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,000
Fine! Just land anywhere!

968
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:41,600
The dandelion patch,
right next to...

969
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,640
...that village of little people.

970
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:45,760
- Village of Little People?
- Village of Little People?

971
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,080
Princess Maia?

972
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,760
Princess Maia!

973
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,840
Princess Maia.

974
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:21,520
My Child!

975
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:23,440
My beauty!

976
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,400
Are you really my mother?

977
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,120
I have a mother.

978
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:29,960
Tom, I have a mother!

979
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,600
I don't know how but you're home.

980
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:35,160
Home.

981
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:37,560
And we'll never
lose each other again.

982
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,480
This is where you belong.

983
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,240
Where I belong.

984
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:43,800
And this must be my father.

985
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,320
Now Maia.

986
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,880
I have another surprise for you.

987
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,960
So good to meet you, my love.

988
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,200
This is your intended.

989
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:57,640
My what?

990
01:04:57,840 --> 01:05:02,680
My darling,
I know this is all so very sudden.

991
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:06,320
I'm certain we'll be very happy
once we're married...

992
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,720
...and get to know each other.

993
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,040
We have to talk.

994
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,480
Look...

995
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:17,800
...ever since I can remember people
have been telling me what to do.

996
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:21,320
And I did it because I didn't
know any better.

997
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:24,320
Well,
now I make all my own decisions.

998
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:25,960
Look, Prince...

999
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:27,880
...I'm sure you're a great guy.

1000
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:33,440
You're handsome, tall,
and well, princely.

1001
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:37,840
But it just wouldn't work because,
you see, there's somebody else.

1002
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:41,920
And If I'm the Princess, I should
be able to be with whomever I want.

1003
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:43,880
Right?

1004
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,480
She's definitely your daughter.

1005
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,800
I know all of this takes
some getting used to.

1006
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,560
The Prince is really a back-up,
you see.

1007
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,360
You were promised at
birth to another Prince...

1008
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:57,760
...but he disappeared
the same night you did.

1009
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,440
His name was Horace.

1010
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,120
Horace?

1011
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:02,800
- Horse?
- Right away!

1012
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,160
Alas, I don't think
there's enough hope...

1013
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:09,320
...in the world to wish
for his return as well.

1014
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:11,720
- Guess again!
- Guess again!

1015
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:13,240
Horace?

1016
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:14,600
- Horace.
- Horace.

1017
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:17,200
His family was always
on the short side.

1018
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,840
My dear.

1019
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:22,000
What other surprises do
you have in store for us?

1020
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:24,280
Mother, I'd like you to
meet my friends.

1021
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,880
We have some unfinished business.

1022
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,720
Don't we Prince Horace?

1023
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,400
That we do.

1024
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:41,400
This is finally, some good news
for our nation

1025
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:48,640
This is finally,
a time for celebration

1026
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:52,280
Finally, this is

1027
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:57,960
A wonderful sensation to feel

1028
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:01,800
As we reveal

1029
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:08,040
A perfect day!
