1
00:01:38,293 --> 00:01:40,359
<i>How'd I end up in this?</i>

2
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:42,160
<i>I'm on the way out.</i>

3
00:01:42,162 --> 00:01:46,130
<i>Ass looking like a black sea lion.</i>

4
00:01:46,132 --> 00:01:51,668
<i>A brother's life was fine until
the day my troubles started.</i>

5
00:01:58,543 --> 00:02:02,978
You's a fine motherfucker.

6
00:02:18,524 --> 00:02:20,991
<i>You see, when I got up that day,</i>

7
00:02:20,993 --> 00:02:22,892
<i>I had Ms in my pocket.</i>

8
00:02:22,894 --> 00:02:24,560
<i>Silk on my back.</i>

9
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:28,196
<i>But most importantly, I had the ladies.</i>

10
00:02:28,198 --> 00:02:30,464
Here I come, world.

11
00:02:30,466 --> 00:02:32,599
Here I come.!

12
00:02:38,938 --> 00:02:40,604
<i>You know, it's funny,</i>

13
00:02:40,606 --> 00:02:43,440
<i>I thought if God wanted all
women to be happy,</i>

14
00:02:43,442 --> 00:02:45,708
<i>he would've made all men like me.</i>

15
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,943
<i>You see, I had the gift of gab.</i>

16
00:02:47,945 --> 00:02:51,046
<i>And the smile that can book
any woman's ass.</i>

17
00:02:51,048 --> 00:02:53,615
What's up, Miss Lady?

18
00:02:53,617 --> 00:02:56,951
<i>Which one of my honeys
did I see that day?</i>

19
00:02:56,953 --> 00:03:00,454
<i>Yeah. First a brother
rolled up on Adrienne.</i>

20
00:03:00,456 --> 00:03:02,556
<i>You see, baby was a little shy.</i>

21
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:05,058
Yeah, it's good.
It means you're strong.

22
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,627
It means you're beautiful.

23
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:09,328
That's right.
Really?

24
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,630
That's right.
You're gorgeous.

25
00:03:11,632 --> 00:03:13,364
That's right. Put it out.
Put your head up.

26
00:03:16,168 --> 00:03:18,434
<i>- Hell, yeah.
- I slobbered her down.</i>

27
00:03:18,436 --> 00:03:20,936
<i>But look, I was just trying
to help her come out.</i>

28
00:03:25,442 --> 00:03:28,109
Adrienne, what are you doing?

29
00:03:28,111 --> 00:03:29,844
<i>Then there was Nikki.</i>

30
00:03:29,846 --> 00:03:33,681
What you need to be doing,
Darnell, is taking care of me.

31
00:03:33,683 --> 00:03:35,349
When did we establish you were my woman?

32
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:37,351
When I opened my legs to you, baby.

33
00:03:37,353 --> 00:03:38,952
The contract was signed then.

34
00:03:38,954 --> 00:03:41,654
<i>Sweet honey, but she was always on me.</i>

35
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:43,856
I ain't on no motherfucking contract.

36
00:03:43,858 --> 00:03:47,458
But you're still on the VIP list.

37
00:03:49,328 --> 00:03:52,195
Better be.
Get it right here.

38
00:03:54,332 --> 00:03:55,431
Ladies.

39
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:57,032
<i>Then I stopped by to see Gwen.</i>

40
00:03:57,034 --> 00:03:58,266
That's your spot.

41
00:04:00,103 --> 00:04:01,602
Right there.

42
00:04:01,604 --> 00:04:04,605
Like that?
That feels so good, baby.

43
00:04:04,607 --> 00:04:06,106
You know, I've got to keep you happy.

44
00:04:06,108 --> 00:04:08,208
Looking so beautiful.

45
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,476
Really?
Yes.

46
00:04:10,478 --> 00:04:12,544
Well, you know,
I've been working extra shifts,

47
00:04:12,546 --> 00:04:14,379
so I've been missing out
on my beauty sleep.

48
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:16,714
Whatever you're doing, it's
working like a motherfucker.

49
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:19,183
- Give me that foot.
- Knucklehead.

50
00:04:19,185 --> 00:04:21,185
<i>See, she had kids.</i>

51
00:04:21,187 --> 00:04:22,786
<i>They weren't mine.</i>

52
00:04:22,788 --> 00:04:25,054
<i>I was just trying help her out.</i>

53
00:04:26,424 --> 00:04:28,424
Is this...?

54
00:04:28,426 --> 00:04:30,525
Look at this baby.
She stinks.

55
00:04:32,128 --> 00:04:34,661
God.

56
00:04:34,663 --> 00:04:36,162
Is that her smelling like that?

57
00:04:37,865 --> 00:04:40,932
No, don't cry.

58
00:04:40,934 --> 00:04:42,466
Tee just paged me.

59
00:04:42,468 --> 00:04:44,768
I think something's going on
down at the club.

60
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,870
<i>And those were just a few of my honeys.</i>

61
00:04:46,872 --> 00:04:50,106
<i>You see, I had a lot of them,
but nobody special.</i>

62
00:04:50,108 --> 00:04:51,340
<i>I loved the ladies.</i>

63
00:04:51,342 --> 00:04:52,641
<i>That was my problem.</i>

64
00:04:52,643 --> 00:04:54,509
<i>Now, my boy Tee was just like me.</i>

65
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:56,077
<i>Well, almost.</i>

66
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,311
Time.

67
00:04:57,313 --> 00:04:59,079
But the time is expired and so is my...

68
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:00,513
What... What is all this?

69
00:05:00,515 --> 00:05:02,014
You're dealing with the time, baby.

70
00:05:02,016 --> 00:05:03,949
Step back.
'Cause you're all in my space.

71
00:05:03,951 --> 00:05:06,251
I want you to do me a favor.
I'm gonna give you this.

72
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:08,319
Chocolate City VIP.
Yeah, whatever.

73
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:10,421
Look, I got to go.
Write your number down there.

74
00:05:10,423 --> 00:05:12,923
Only number you're getting is
the number to the ticket office.

75
00:05:12,925 --> 00:05:14,691
Because I gots to go. Step off.

76
00:05:14,693 --> 00:05:16,426
Okay, sweetheart,
you ain't gotta be so mean.

77
00:05:16,428 --> 00:05:18,995
Whatever.
You still look good.

78
00:05:18,997 --> 00:05:20,930
I'll call you later.

79
00:05:20,932 --> 00:05:23,032
What's up?

80
00:05:23,034 --> 00:05:24,867
What'd you do, man,
you get another ticket?

81
00:05:24,869 --> 00:05:26,602
No, man, got the number.

82
00:05:26,604 --> 00:05:29,938
<i>You see, I understood him
and he understood me.</i>

83
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,507
<i>And together we was running
this little nightclub thing:</i>

84
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:34,509
<i>Chocolate City.</i>

85
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:36,410
Man, I ain't giving you
a dime of my money

86
00:05:36,412 --> 00:05:38,178
for no damn parking ticket.

87
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,013
Damn, Smitty, but I was working.

88
00:05:40,015 --> 00:05:42,115
I don't care if you was selling
oranges by the freeway.

89
00:05:42,117 --> 00:05:43,649
I don't pay for parking tickets.

90
00:05:43,651 --> 00:05:45,517
I pay your salary.

91
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,620
I pay a damn good salary at that.

92
00:05:48,622 --> 00:05:51,022
Now, sit down.

93
00:05:51,024 --> 00:05:52,823
<i>Smitty was the owner.</i>

94
00:05:52,825 --> 00:05:55,592
<i>He didn't take no shit.</i>

95
00:05:55,594 --> 00:05:57,594
All right, man, I'm gonna give
it to you young fellas.

96
00:05:57,596 --> 00:05:58,995
Y'all have put some of the chocolate

97
00:05:58,997 --> 00:06:00,730
back in Chocolate City,

98
00:06:00,732 --> 00:06:02,998
but I need more chocolate
in Chocolate City.

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,900
Tell you the truth, ol' Smitty
is just tired of trying to

100
00:06:05,902 --> 00:06:09,570
juggle this business by himself so...

101
00:06:09,572 --> 00:06:11,805
I was thinking about
taking on some partners.

102
00:06:11,807 --> 00:06:13,239
- Somebody...
- That's us.

103
00:06:13,241 --> 00:06:16,075
Somebody...
Right here. Us.

104
00:06:16,077 --> 00:06:18,177
That he can trust with the money.

105
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:22,480
Every penny of his money.

106
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,081
<i>So my life was good.</i>

107
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,650
<i>And damn sure getting better.</i>

108
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:27,951
<i>That's why when I saw her,</i> Damn.

109
00:06:27,953 --> 00:06:29,319
<i>I stepped to her.</i>

110
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:31,754
<i>Like a moth to a flame.</i>

111
00:06:31,756 --> 00:06:33,989
<i>A bull to a matador.</i>

112
00:06:33,991 --> 00:06:37,625
<i>A dog to a cat.</i>

113
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:44,196
Watch this, watch this.

114
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,299
How you doin', baby?

115
00:06:50,136 --> 00:06:52,469
"How am I doing, baby?"

116
00:06:52,471 --> 00:06:55,138
I'm not your baby.

117
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,407
Excuse me. Most men would've
called you stuck-up.

118
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:00,242
Looking all like a Barbie doll.

119
00:07:00,244 --> 00:07:02,010
<i>That was it.</i>

120
00:07:02,012 --> 00:07:05,313
<i>The moment that changed
my motherfucking life.</i>

121
00:07:05,315 --> 00:07:07,748
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

122
00:07:09,084 --> 00:07:10,783
That's no way to talk to a lady.

123
00:07:10,785 --> 00:07:13,318
Madame.
Let me get your door for you.

124
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,887
He didn't mean nothing by that.
Yes, I did.

125
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:18,456
He just, you know,
fell on his head as a baby.

126
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,324
So he's just been a little
rattled ever since.

127
00:07:20,326 --> 00:07:22,659
I see. Well,
maybe I should arrange for him

128
00:07:22,661 --> 00:07:25,595
to fall on his head again
so he can get unrattled.

129
00:07:25,597 --> 00:07:27,997
Baby, baby, don't let nobody
steal your joy.

130
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:31,567
I would like to mend that broken heart

131
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:34,102
by inviting you to Chocolate City.

132
00:07:34,104 --> 00:07:35,770
I wanna put you on the VIP.

133
00:07:35,772 --> 00:07:38,139
Chocolate City?

134
00:07:38,141 --> 00:07:40,741
Thank you, but no thank you.

135
00:07:40,743 --> 00:07:43,076
Well, I just figured,
since you in the neighborhood,

136
00:07:43,078 --> 00:07:44,644
if you come to the neighborhood to shop,

137
00:07:44,646 --> 00:07:47,446
come on and party in the neighborhood.

138
00:07:47,448 --> 00:07:49,247
I don't get to the neighborhood
very often.

139
00:07:49,249 --> 00:07:51,482
Drive on, Luis.

140
00:07:51,484 --> 00:07:53,383
Don't be like that.

141
00:07:53,385 --> 00:07:55,618
Miss Lady, don't be like that.

142
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,943
Hold it right there.

143
00:08:27,945 --> 00:08:30,245
Mama.!

144
00:08:30,247 --> 00:08:31,879
What's happening?

145
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:34,314
I told you to stop slipping
money in my pocket.

146
00:08:34,316 --> 00:08:36,749
Ma.
We don't need it.

147
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:39,384
Your daddy's social security,
God rest his soul,

148
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:40,618
does us just fine.

149
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,187
Ma.

150
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:46,891
So, what's up?
What you cooking?

151
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:48,692
Well, it ain't steak.

152
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,995
All right, Mama, you go
and eat a nasty greens.

153
00:08:51,997 --> 00:08:54,464
You want your son
to have some vegetables.

154
00:08:54,466 --> 00:08:57,667
Let's see what's in this pot.

155
00:08:57,669 --> 00:08:59,902
Bam. Mama.

156
00:08:59,904 --> 00:09:03,005
The home fries.
The homemade fries.

157
00:09:03,007 --> 00:09:04,840
That's what I'm talkin' about.

158
00:09:04,842 --> 00:09:07,075
Mama, please, not too much salt.

159
00:09:07,077 --> 00:09:09,644
You know what they say,
make your feet fat.

160
00:09:09,646 --> 00:09:11,212
So, Mama, what's up?

161
00:09:11,214 --> 00:09:13,714
You been, watching the talk shows?

162
00:09:13,716 --> 00:09:15,348
I don't watch that junk.

163
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,316
I got enough trouble in my life already.

164
00:09:17,318 --> 00:09:21,119
Ma. Nah, nah, nah.

165
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:23,554
- Ma!
- Hey, baby.

166
00:09:23,556 --> 00:09:26,056
What you doing here?
What's up, Big Head?

167
00:09:26,058 --> 00:09:28,625
Hey, Mama.

168
00:09:28,627 --> 00:09:30,360
Ma, guess what happened to me today.

169
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:31,627
What? What happened?
Tell me.

170
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:33,362
I got asked to the senior prom!

171
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,298
You did?
That's so wonderful.

172
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,034
- By who?
- None of your business.

173
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,569
Nobody you know.

174
00:09:41,571 --> 00:09:43,871
What do you mean nobody I know?

175
00:09:43,873 --> 00:09:46,006
Look, when somebody ask
my 15-year-old sister

176
00:09:46,008 --> 00:09:47,707
to the prom,

177
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:50,176
your brother has the right
to know with who.

178
00:09:50,178 --> 00:09:52,211
His name is Rodney Smalls, okay?

179
00:09:52,213 --> 00:09:55,147
So anyway, Mama, I was think...
Wait a minute. Who?

180
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:58,116
I say "who?" Rodney Smalls?

181
00:09:59,285 --> 00:10:00,717
Yeah.

182
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:02,552
Cleofus' little brother?
Yes.

183
00:10:02,554 --> 00:10:05,521
No. Y-You cancel that.
No, Mama, you...

184
00:10:05,523 --> 00:10:06,722
Take her out of that.

185
00:10:06,724 --> 00:10:09,357
Mama, do you know Cleofus' brother, he...

186
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,360
He mack more honeys,
Mama, than... Than...

187
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:13,828
The one who I'm looking at right now?

188
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,630
Thank you.

189
00:10:16,632 --> 00:10:19,232
Okay. I-I picked
a bad day to come over.

190
00:10:19,234 --> 00:10:20,800
It's a mama-daughter jump.

191
00:10:20,802 --> 00:10:22,701
Okay, okay.

192
00:10:22,703 --> 00:10:25,103
Mama, you want her coming home
with a little... Little:

193
00:10:26,706 --> 00:10:28,472
Now, don't you get me started on you.

194
00:10:28,474 --> 00:10:31,341
Miss Jacqueline and Miss Suzanne,

195
00:10:31,343 --> 00:10:33,509
and Miss Rita, and Miss LaQuisha

196
00:10:33,511 --> 00:10:35,878
keep calling on my phone looking for you.

197
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,614
I'm sorry about that, Mama.

198
00:10:38,616 --> 00:10:40,282
Darnell, you got your own phone,

199
00:10:40,284 --> 00:10:42,651
why you keep giving these women
my phone number?

200
00:10:42,653 --> 00:10:44,452
Because, Ma, if they call you,
bugging you,

201
00:10:44,454 --> 00:10:46,153
you're gonna tell them to go
straight to hell.

202
00:10:46,155 --> 00:10:47,787
You listen to me.

203
00:10:47,789 --> 00:10:50,856
Your ways are gonna catch up
with you one day.

204
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:54,893
A night full of passion
can give you a lifetime of pain.

205
00:10:54,895 --> 00:10:56,561
Ain't nobody...

206
00:10:56,563 --> 00:10:58,596
Darnell.

207
00:10:58,598 --> 00:11:01,765
It's a thin line between love and hate.

208
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:04,000
Ma, it ain't...

209
00:11:04,002 --> 00:11:06,669
Mama, I guess it's your fault, Mama.

210
00:11:06,671 --> 00:11:09,838
You spoiled me. Heh.

211
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,006
You know, you loved me so good, Mama...

212
00:11:12,008 --> 00:11:15,275
Mia's coming home.

213
00:11:15,277 --> 00:11:17,777
Don't act like you're not happy.

214
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:20,780
Mama, is that...?

215
00:11:20,782 --> 00:11:22,047
That's what this is about?

216
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:24,382
No, this is not about Mia.

217
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:26,117
That girl's going on with her life.

218
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,285
This is about you, Deeny.

219
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:30,553
See, now you're calling me Deeny.

220
00:11:30,555 --> 00:11:32,288
You ain't called me that
since I was young.

221
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:35,024
So now I...

222
00:11:38,928 --> 00:11:40,627
Hey, man.

223
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:42,362
Hey, D.
Didn't mean to lose y'all.

224
00:11:42,364 --> 00:11:44,197
What's happening? What's up?

225
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:45,665
What's up, I'll buy now.

226
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:47,800
I'm still waiting on you
to ask me to dance.

227
00:11:47,802 --> 00:11:50,135
Baby, I can't dance
with you till I get a chance.

228
00:11:50,137 --> 00:11:51,836
When you get a chance?

229
00:11:51,838 --> 00:11:53,771
I don't know what ho
you got me confused with,

230
00:11:53,773 --> 00:11:55,472
but I ain't one for you
to put to the side...

231
00:11:55,474 --> 00:11:58,708
Nikki, Nikki, baby, I'm...
I'm handling business first.

232
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,710
Walk on over here.
Don't be sitting at the bar,

233
00:12:00,712 --> 00:12:03,112
just sitting there. Make room
for the drunk motherfuckers.

234
00:12:03,114 --> 00:12:05,481
Adrienne.

235
00:12:05,483 --> 00:12:07,816
Look at you. You look good,
you know that?

236
00:12:07,818 --> 00:12:11,085
Go on out on that dance floor,
and get... Get your boogie on.

237
00:12:11,087 --> 00:12:13,987
Can... Can you get that?
No, no, no, no, no, no.

238
00:12:13,989 --> 00:12:17,490
I'm saying... I'm saying on...
On the dance floor.

239
00:12:17,492 --> 00:12:20,793
On the dance floor.
Watch yourself.

240
00:12:25,331 --> 00:12:26,496
Hey, it's... Yo.

Hey, yo, the ladies is all up

00:12:35,872 --> 00:12:38,505
Well, then why you sitting here?

245
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,973
Because I'm taking a rest.

246
00:12:39,975 --> 00:12:42,909
Man, my pockets is full of numbers, man.

247
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:43,976
Look, man.

248
00:13:01,261 --> 00:13:03,928
She came.

249
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:13,003
She motherfucking came.

250
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:16,172
She dissed you earlier,
she gonna dis you again.

251
00:13:16,174 --> 00:13:18,407
No, no. She wouldn't be here
for that, partner.

252
00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:21,143
She wouldn't be here for that.

253
00:13:21,145 --> 00:13:22,277
Man, he ain't gonna pull that.

254
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:24,312
I don't know why...

255
00:13:25,782 --> 00:13:27,981
How you doing, Miss Lady?

256
00:13:30,785 --> 00:13:32,017
Fine.

257
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,319
I see you came to see me.

258
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:36,621
I came to see the club.
Not you.

259
00:13:36,623 --> 00:13:40,857
Well, since we both here,
what's happening?

260
00:13:42,627 --> 00:13:45,594
Let me... Let me get you
something to drink, Miss Lady.

261
00:13:45,596 --> 00:13:48,229
- Sean.
- Yo, D.

262
00:13:48,231 --> 00:13:50,464
Give Miss Lady a glass of champagne.

263
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:52,799
Coming right up.
On the house.

264
00:13:52,801 --> 00:13:54,834
On me.

265
00:13:54,836 --> 00:13:56,836
What you want, glass or bottle?

266
00:13:58,439 --> 00:14:01,673
I don't know what you're selling,

267
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,975
but I'm not buying.

268
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,349
She dissed him?

269
00:14:14,752 --> 00:14:16,985
He look like a sad-ass puppy.

270
00:14:16,987 --> 00:14:19,120
Look, Look, he's hawking her.

271
00:14:19,122 --> 00:14:21,889
She dissed you.

272
00:14:21,891 --> 00:14:23,924
Hey, hey, she dissed nobody.

273
00:14:23,926 --> 00:14:25,325
I got the number right here, boy.

274
00:14:25,327 --> 00:14:26,959
You ain't got the number.

275
00:14:26,961 --> 00:14:30,662
She is kind of fine, though.
Look at her shake that ass.

276
00:14:30,664 --> 00:14:33,665
All right, listen, I bet you
$20 you can't hit that.

277
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,833
First of all, I ain't gonna bet
on the ladies like that.

278
00:14:35,835 --> 00:14:37,801
Okay? All right?

279
00:14:37,803 --> 00:14:40,270
You gonna have to tell her you love her.

280
00:14:40,272 --> 00:14:41,971
No, no.
You know that's our code.

281
00:14:41,973 --> 00:14:44,239
Never tell 'em you love 'em.

282
00:14:44,241 --> 00:14:46,407
- That's correct.
- I'm gonna hit that.

283
00:14:46,409 --> 00:14:48,575
- You know I am.
- Yeah, right.

284
00:14:48,577 --> 00:14:51,244
And when I hit it, first thing
I'm gonna do is call you,

285
00:14:51,246 --> 00:14:53,879
and all I wanna hear from you is:

286
00:14:53,881 --> 00:14:56,147
"Yo, D, you the man."

287
00:14:56,149 --> 00:14:59,884
I tell you what.
If you hit that,

288
00:14:59,886 --> 00:15:02,720
from this day on, every day I see you,

289
00:15:02,722 --> 00:15:05,155
I'll approach you like that.
"You the man."

290
00:15:05,157 --> 00:15:06,990
- We'll mack.
- She know we'll mack.

291
00:15:06,992 --> 00:15:09,292
I ain't no player-hater.

292
00:15:09,294 --> 00:15:11,160
Well, bet him.

293
00:15:11,162 --> 00:15:12,427
Where'd she go?

294
00:15:12,429 --> 00:15:14,829
She m-ma... M-macked out.

295
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,653
That was a good one you just had.

296
00:15:25,572 --> 00:15:27,705
Hey, D.
Hi, y'all, what's happening?

297
00:15:27,707 --> 00:15:29,773
Go, have a good time.

298
00:15:29,775 --> 00:15:32,375
No, you ain't getting away
from me right now.

299
00:15:32,377 --> 00:15:34,977
No, not now.

300
00:15:34,979 --> 00:15:39,147
All right, come on.
Thank you.

301
00:15:42,418 --> 00:15:47,053
Can I please
have your... Your autograph?

302
00:15:47,055 --> 00:15:48,454
You're En Vogue, right?

303
00:15:48,456 --> 00:15:51,623
No, it ain't En Vogue, it's TLC.

304
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,158
But, look, I'm glad
y'all came to Chocolate City.

305
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,426
- Here's something for...
- Hey, Darnell.

306
00:15:56,428 --> 00:15:58,961
It's nice to come home and see
that things haven't changed.

307
00:15:58,963 --> 00:16:00,529
Mia.

308
00:16:02,566 --> 00:16:05,800
Mia, baby. What's happening?

309
00:16:05,802 --> 00:16:07,902
You're back, baby.

310
00:16:09,739 --> 00:16:12,206
So you can't speak to nobody, Darnell?

311
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,575
What's happening, Peach?

312
00:16:14,577 --> 00:16:16,977
Yeah, what's up, Darnell?

313
00:16:16,979 --> 00:16:19,579

00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,694
So how are you doing?

00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,463

Just, buy that.

323
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:44,999
That's good.

324
00:16:45,001 --> 00:16:46,467
But how are you really doing?

325
00:16:46,469 --> 00:16:50,470
Well, now that I see you...

326
00:16:50,472 --> 00:16:52,038
I'm cool.

327
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,906
That's cool.

328
00:16:53,908 --> 00:16:56,975
You're both cool?
Because I'm hot.

329
00:16:56,977 --> 00:16:58,876
Can we go get something to drink?

330
00:16:58,878 --> 00:17:01,478
Yo, what's up with the VIP?
Can we get the VIP with that?

331
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,079
You are talking to Mr. VIP.

332
00:17:03,081 --> 00:17:04,380
You see the jacket, right?

333
00:17:04,382 --> 00:17:06,348
Tee's gonna handle that.
I gotta stay here,

334
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,116
handle some business.
This way, ladies.

335
00:17:08,118 --> 00:17:09,617
I'll be there in a minute.
All right.

336
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:12,085
Just make sure you wait for me, Mia.

337
00:17:13,321 --> 00:17:15,888
Mia.

338
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,422
You promise you gonna wait for me?

339
00:17:23,696 --> 00:17:25,529
What up, partner?
What's up, player?

How you doing?
What's going on, boy?

00:17:26,999 --> 00:17:30,000
Look at your ass. Looking like
a back-alley cowboy.

342
00:17:30,002 --> 00:17:31,501
What the fuck is up?

343
00:17:31,503 --> 00:17:34,036
You look like you losing weight,
you need some pork.

344
00:17:34,038 --> 00:17:36,038
Motherfucker, you eating

00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,310
Come on, baby.

349
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,277
What the fuck is this, man?

350
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:45,678
That's you.
No, man.

351
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,046
That's you.

352
00:17:47,048 --> 00:17:49,615
Ben Vereen can flow in this,
but no. No, I can't flow.

353
00:17:49,617 --> 00:17:51,316
You're right.
He ordered that piece.

354
00:17:51,318 --> 00:17:53,217
Let me have something else.
What we got?

355
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:55,219
This is a little more smooth,
you know what I mean?

356
00:17:55,221 --> 00:17:57,287
Show your little cuts, your walk,

357
00:17:57,289 --> 00:17:58,955
your build's on, that's funky.

358
00:17:58,957 --> 00:18:00,957
For somebody else, but look.

359
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:02,224
Okay.

360
00:18:02,226 --> 00:18:05,126
Right, okay. Give me something.
Talk to me.

361
00:18:05,128 --> 00:18:07,027
You're gonna go...?

362
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:08,995
Okay, okay, you do
the money green in on me?

363
00:18:08,997 --> 00:18:10,229
That's right.
Okay.

364
00:18:10,231 --> 00:18:12,164
That's right.
All right, well, let me think.

365
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,431
Let me go to the head.
Bam.

366
00:18:13,433 --> 00:18:15,332
I give you $45.

367
00:18:15,334 --> 00:18:17,500
Nigga, please.

368
00:18:17,502 --> 00:18:19,869
This shirt is a hundred dollars, partner.

369
00:18:19,871 --> 00:18:21,437
Motherfucker, we in a alley.

370
00:18:21,439 --> 00:18:23,305
Smell like piss and oil.

371
00:18:23,307 --> 00:18:24,673
Man.
Come on, man.

372
00:18:24,675 --> 00:18:26,675
You know how you can get that for $45?

373
00:18:26,677 --> 00:18:28,943
Talk to me. What's happening?
Step in my office.

374
00:18:28,945 --> 00:18:30,644
What's up?

375
00:18:30,646 --> 00:18:34,347
You know that broad
you used to fuck, Cindy?

376
00:18:34,349 --> 00:18:36,215
Right, the one that got
the sister name...

377
00:18:36,217 --> 00:18:38,116
Jenny. Jeanene?
Something like that.

378
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:39,550
Okay, right.
I think it's Jeanene.

379
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,351
Something like that.
Okay, okay. Right.

380
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:43,286
Hook a nigga up.

381
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,321
I ain't saying you gotta
pull down the pants.

382
00:18:45,323 --> 00:18:47,323
You don't wanna fuck with her, man.

383
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:49,024
I mean, you know what I mean?

384
00:18:49,026 --> 00:18:51,826
You... You...
You're a good, wholesome man.

385
00:18:51,828 --> 00:18:54,161
You're trying to make a...
A living out of your truck.

386
00:18:54,163 --> 00:18:57,697
You fucked her?
You fucked her, didn't you?

387
00:18:57,699 --> 00:19:00,766
She was loud?

388
00:19:00,768 --> 00:19:03,535
You mother...

389
00:19:03,537 --> 00:19:05,770
You fucked her?
Nah, I didn't fuck her.

390
00:19:05,772 --> 00:19:07,772
You were...
You were scaring me.

391
00:19:07,774 --> 00:19:09,206
No, I didn't fuck her.

392
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,142
She sucked my dick though.

393
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:18,846
All over that motherfucker.

394
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,915
I love you.

395
00:19:22,917 --> 00:19:24,650
That's her past though.
Right.

396
00:19:24,652 --> 00:19:26,852
Yeah. So you gonna give me
the shirts for $45?

397
00:19:26,854 --> 00:19:29,421
They $45. And you'll hook...
You're gonna hook it up?

398
00:19:29,423 --> 00:19:31,523
Forty-five dollars.
Forty-five dollars.

399
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:33,324
I'll hook you up.
That's all right.

400
00:19:33,326 --> 00:19:36,860
Yo, there was some fine honeys
up in VIP last night.

401
00:19:36,862 --> 00:19:38,494
Except for Nikki.

402
00:19:38,496 --> 00:19:40,796
She got drunk, just start
claiming motherfuckers.

403
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:43,431
Yeah, she did that shit
in front of Mia and Peaches too.

404
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:46,967
You know what?
I got a plan formed though.

405
00:19:46,969 --> 00:19:48,935
Take her ass off the VIP list.

406
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:51,137
Gotcha. Gotta. Gotta.

407
00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:54,240
Hey, yo, yo, yo, yo, check it out though.

408
00:19:54,242 --> 00:19:56,842
Mia's looking kind of good, man.

409
00:19:56,844 --> 00:19:58,643
Makes you wonder, man,

410
00:19:58,645 --> 00:20:00,911
she been around all them Top Gun
type of motherfuckers, man.

411
00:20:00,913 --> 00:20:02,812
What you saying?

412
00:20:02,814 --> 00:20:05,080
I'm just speculating,
you know what I'm saying?

413
00:20:05,082 --> 00:20:07,949
I mean she's nice, young,

414
00:20:07,951 --> 00:20:09,517
single, black,

415
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:11,085
nice little tight body,

416
00:20:11,087 --> 00:20:13,687
titties like.

417
00:20:13,689 --> 00:20:15,255
Pow!
You know what I'm saying?

418
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:17,957
Beautiful brown eyes and shit.
You ain't never been more right.

419
00:20:17,959 --> 00:20:19,191
Fuck you, Tee.

420
00:20:19,193 --> 00:20:21,626
Man, why... Why you bugging, man?

421
00:20:21,628 --> 00:20:25,429
What you need to be worried
about is the mystery woman.

422
00:20:25,431 --> 00:20:27,464
'Cause I ain't giving you
no extension on that,

423
00:20:27,466 --> 00:20:29,265
know what I'm saying?
I... You know me.

424
00:20:29,267 --> 00:20:31,934
I don't give extension.
Tee,

425
00:20:31,936 --> 00:20:33,568
I got it handled.
I hope so.

426
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,735
All right, man.

427
00:20:34,737 --> 00:20:35,836
Okay. All right.

428
00:20:35,838 --> 00:20:38,505
You a wild boy, man.
You know what I mean?

429
00:20:38,507 --> 00:20:41,241
Old fatherly-figure
type motherfucker.

430
00:20:41,243 --> 00:20:43,409
You've got it handled?
Ain't that about a bitch.

431
00:20:43,411 --> 00:20:45,844
Yeah, whatever.
Whatever.

432
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:57,620
Look at you.

433
00:20:57,622 --> 00:21:01,756
Sexier than a motherfucker.

434
00:21:01,758 --> 00:21:04,458
I salute you.

435
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,960
With both hands.

436
00:21:06,962 --> 00:21:08,795
What?

437
00:21:08,797 --> 00:21:10,897
Look. I just...

438
00:21:10,899 --> 00:21:14,100
I just got to give you
your props. Much respect.

439
00:21:14,102 --> 00:21:16,969
Miss Lady, you handling your business.

440
00:21:16,971 --> 00:21:18,003
You look beautiful.

441
00:21:18,005 --> 00:21:19,471
Thank you.

442
00:21:19,473 --> 00:21:22,340
Check it out, I bought you something.

443
00:21:25,978 --> 00:21:30,246
Jujubes. God, I haven't had
these in a long time.

444
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:32,615
Well, figured since you coming home,

445
00:21:32,617 --> 00:21:34,617
brother had to hook you up, you know?

446
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:37,119
Yeah, well, it's little things like this

447
00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:39,888
that make being home special.

448
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:42,457
Yeah?

449
00:21:42,459 --> 00:21:44,659
Well, look, tell me about the Air Force.

450
00:21:44,661 --> 00:21:46,961
Is it all it can be?

451
00:21:46,963 --> 00:21:49,330
Yeah. You gotta get used to it.

452
00:21:49,332 --> 00:21:54,000
It's a lot of opportunities
for your education, travel.

453
00:21:54,002 --> 00:21:55,801
I met a lot of interesting people.

454
00:21:55,803 --> 00:21:57,969
You mean, like, privates, what?

455
00:21:57,971 --> 00:22:00,738
Airmen. Is that what you mean?

456
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:03,140
Airmen? I'm talking about
some of them.

457
00:22:03,142 --> 00:22:05,108
Top Gun-type motherfuckers.

458
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:08,077
Maybe. What you wanna know for?

459
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:11,779
I wanna know, what's your rush
for getting back?

460
00:22:11,781 --> 00:22:13,147
Wait a minute. Wa... Hold it.

461
00:22:13,149 --> 00:22:15,415
Let me get straight.

462
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:19,284
Are you saying that the reason
I'd go back is because of a man?

463
00:22:20,387 --> 00:22:23,787
Right. Right.

464
00:22:25,323 --> 00:22:27,323
I don't believe you.

465
00:22:28,893 --> 00:22:32,494
Hello, Darnell? Did you hear
anything that I said?

466
00:22:34,831 --> 00:22:38,431
If I re-enlist, it's because
it'll be the best thing for me.

467
00:22:38,433 --> 00:22:39,899
Me.

468
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:42,902
That's all the bro wanted
to know, that's all. Heh.

469
00:22:45,106 --> 00:22:47,306
Could you get the door for me?

470
00:22:57,317 --> 00:22:59,750
Something I can do for you, man?

471
00:22:59,752 --> 00:23:02,052
Is Mia here?

472
00:23:02,054 --> 00:23:05,121
She's busy right now, but,

473
00:23:05,123 --> 00:23:06,956
is there something I can help you with?

474
00:23:06,958 --> 00:23:10,759
I think she's expecting me.

475
00:23:10,761 --> 00:23:14,629
Okay then. You the chicken
delivery boy?

476
00:23:14,631 --> 00:23:17,531
You're a well-dressed one,
I'll tell you that.

477
00:23:17,533 --> 00:23:19,232
Is that you, Reggie?

478
00:23:19,234 --> 00:23:21,133
Yeah.

479
00:23:21,135 --> 00:23:24,469
I'm out here trying to get past
your little doorman.

480
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:25,970
I'll be right out.

481
00:23:25,972 --> 00:23:28,205
Okay.

482
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:31,741
No disrespect, partner.

483
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,044
You know, you just can't be too careful.

484
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:37,013
There was this chicken-delivery
rapist back in the '80s,

485
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:39,181
just running around
plucking motherfuckers...

486
00:23:39,183 --> 00:23:42,517
Let me stop you right there.
I don't deliver chicken.

487
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:45,119
My family owns Chicken Fixens.

488
00:23:45,121 --> 00:23:47,354
In fact, we own 20 Chicken Fixens,

489
00:23:47,356 --> 00:23:49,856
and netted five million
in profit last year.

490
00:23:49,858 --> 00:23:52,391
Should be obvious.

491
00:23:52,393 --> 00:23:54,626
Damn.
You banking like that,

492
00:23:54,628 --> 00:23:57,729
and you come over here
with a biscuit meal, man?

493
00:23:57,731 --> 00:24:00,230
- I mean, you...
- Hey, Reggie.

494
00:24:02,033 --> 00:24:03,866
There is a God.

495
00:24:03,868 --> 00:24:06,802
I see you two have met.

496
00:24:06,804 --> 00:24:09,738
Yeah. Yeah.

497
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,239
Yeah.

498
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:14,308
Look, I, I thought we'd grab a bite

499
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,509
before we drove up the coast.

500
00:24:15,511 --> 00:24:18,277
I took the top down on the Porsche.

501
00:24:19,847 --> 00:24:21,513
Well, look, I don't wanna interrupt

502
00:24:21,515 --> 00:24:24,716
y'all driving up the coast
in the Porsche.

503
00:24:24,718 --> 00:24:29,519
Especially with your
Chicken Fixen biscuit dinner.

504
00:24:29,521 --> 00:24:32,288
So, I'm gonna roll on over
to Chocolate City,

505
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:34,556
'cause you know I'm about
to own it, so, you know,

506
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:36,324
I gotta do some paperwork over there.

507
00:24:36,326 --> 00:24:38,025
You know you're still on the VIP.

508
00:24:38,027 --> 00:24:41,894
You know, if you bring anybody
with you, please, you know,

509
00:24:41,896 --> 00:24:43,695
put a call in or something.

510
00:24:43,697 --> 00:24:46,531
And, you know, hopefully when we get

511
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:48,466
some food in the club,

512
00:24:48,468 --> 00:24:50,367
your boy could deliver the chicken.

513
00:24:58,009 --> 00:24:59,041
Sh...

514
00:24:59,043 --> 00:25:00,342
Can I help you?

515
00:25:00,344 --> 00:25:01,676
What's happening, brother?

516
00:25:15,457 --> 00:25:17,190
What's up, man?

517
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:19,024
Pass?

518
00:25:19,026 --> 00:25:20,358
Plant. Got one.

519
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:24,028
No, there's...
Look, there's no chance.

520
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,963
No, it's not a mistake.

521
00:25:25,965 --> 00:25:28,966
I... It's a sure thing,
Irving.

522
00:25:28,968 --> 00:25:31,468
No, don't you think.
You hired me to think.

523
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,636
Now just trust me.
This is a good deal.

524
00:25:33,638 --> 00:25:35,204
Tell Irving you'll call him back.

525
00:25:38,775 --> 00:25:40,407
Irving...

526
00:25:42,177 --> 00:25:43,909
I'll call you back.

527
00:25:46,613 --> 00:25:49,180
Wow.

528
00:25:49,182 --> 00:25:51,448
You know, I have been through a whole lot

529
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,283
to find you, Miss Brandi Web.

530
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:59,054
For you.

531
00:26:02,692 --> 00:26:04,525
Lovely.

532
00:26:04,527 --> 00:26:05,792
Michael, take these out.

533
00:26:05,794 --> 00:26:07,360
Yes, ma'am.

534
00:26:07,362 --> 00:26:09,462
Call security.
I want him out now.

535
00:26:09,464 --> 00:26:10,796
Hold up.
Right away, Miss Web.

536
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:13,298
Security?

537
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,934
Why, you...?
Why do you gotta go there?

538
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:22,538
Because you came here.

539
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,373
I only came here because

540
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:27,042
I haven't been able to think
of anything or anyone

541
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:28,843
since I met you.

542
00:26:28,845 --> 00:26:33,414
Met? We...?
We actually met?

543
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:34,915
That's what you think?

544
00:26:34,917 --> 00:26:37,784
That's what you call your immature play?

545
00:26:40,622 --> 00:26:42,989
You're joking.
You know, that's funny.

546
00:26:44,325 --> 00:26:46,825
Most women I know,

547
00:26:46,827 --> 00:26:49,194
seem to think I'm very mature.

548
00:26:49,196 --> 00:26:51,963
Look, you just...
This is...

549
00:26:51,965 --> 00:26:54,532
Don't...
This is Lalique!

550
00:26:54,534 --> 00:26:56,500
Of course, you don't know what that is.

551
00:26:56,502 --> 00:26:58,435
Get him out, please.
Is there a problem?

552
00:26:58,437 --> 00:27:00,470
No, no. Look,
call off your handlers.

553
00:27:00,472 --> 00:27:02,205
Call off your handlers, please.

554
00:27:02,207 --> 00:27:03,940
Give me a second.

555
00:27:03,942 --> 00:27:05,641
A split second.

556
00:27:05,643 --> 00:27:08,510
Look, obviously

557
00:27:08,512 --> 00:27:10,278
I made a big mistake.

558
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,613
No disrespect intended.

559
00:27:12,615 --> 00:27:16,416
I met a beautiful woman,
I got beside myself.

560
00:27:16,418 --> 00:27:19,918
I apologize from the heart.

561
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,153
You're forgiven.

562
00:27:22,155 --> 00:27:23,621
Out.

563
00:27:23,623 --> 00:27:26,423
Time to go, man.
Check-out time.

564
00:27:26,425 --> 00:27:28,358
No. I didn't mean to
knock over your Malique.

565
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,993
Man, you're not listening.
No, I am listening.

566
00:27:30,995 --> 00:27:34,629
Hey, this is straight-up
on the bullshit level, man!

567
00:27:34,631 --> 00:27:36,764
Y'all gonna throw me out over this lady?

568
00:27:36,766 --> 00:27:39,500
Maybe... Maybe a brother...
Look man...

569
00:27:39,502 --> 00:27:40,934
I'm not trying to get on that.

570
00:27:40,936 --> 00:27:43,770
Man, you just fake...
Man, you a flashlight cop, man!

571
00:27:43,772 --> 00:27:44,804
Take it on home.

572
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,173
- Yeah!
- That's cold.

573
00:27:48,175 --> 00:27:50,675
- Next.
- Fake-ass toy cops!

574
00:27:50,677 --> 00:27:52,343
Show how much they care about you.

575
00:27:52,345 --> 00:27:53,610
They ain't even give you no gun.

576
00:27:53,612 --> 00:27:57,380
You're flashlight cops.
I see you. I see you.

577
00:28:00,351 --> 00:28:03,318
Get them damn doors fixed, man!

578
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,320
Before you start throwing people out.

579
00:28:12,161 --> 00:28:15,295
Hello.
Sorry I'm late.

580
00:28:17,565 --> 00:28:19,932
How you doing, Miss Web?

581
00:28:19,934 --> 00:28:23,268
Mr. Wright is in the c-car.

582
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:27,271
I see.
Is he going to get out?

583
00:28:27,273 --> 00:28:30,307
As soon as I

584
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:32,475
open the d-door.

585
00:28:39,649 --> 00:28:41,515
I like it.

586
00:28:41,517 --> 00:28:44,917
I like it. A little small,
but I like it.

587
00:28:45,953 --> 00:28:48,152
D-D-Do this, boy.

588
00:28:50,256 --> 00:28:52,990
I don't believe it.

589
00:28:52,992 --> 00:28:55,292
What... What are you doing here?

590
00:28:55,294 --> 00:28:57,060
I'm waiting for you to show me the house.

591
00:28:57,062 --> 00:29:00,663
And to be perfectly honest,
I don't have all day.

592
00:29:00,665 --> 00:29:02,331
I don't mean to be rude,
Mr. Wright.

593
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:03,899
Call me Darnell.

594
00:29:03,901 --> 00:29:05,233
Don't mess up a brother's name.

595
00:29:05,235 --> 00:29:06,968
Whatever your name is.

596
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:09,403
But I have a very serious
question for you.

597
00:29:09,405 --> 00:29:11,671
Because, you see, this is my business.

598
00:29:11,673 --> 00:29:13,339
Can you afford this house?

599
00:29:13,341 --> 00:29:15,941
Well, to be perfectly honest,

600
00:29:15,943 --> 00:29:18,777
I wouldn't be here

601
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:21,613
if I couldn't be here.

602
00:29:21,615 --> 00:29:24,849
Now is this how you treat
a potential buyer?

603
00:29:28,587 --> 00:29:30,320
Fine.

604
00:29:32,424 --> 00:29:33,923
Fine.

605
00:29:36,727 --> 00:29:40,595
You can see that all of the marble

606
00:29:40,597 --> 00:29:43,965
on the countertops
was imported from Florence.

607
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:46,634
Florence and Normandie?

608
00:29:46,636 --> 00:29:49,003
Italy, Mr. Wright. Italy.

609
00:29:49,005 --> 00:29:52,539
My bad. I'm thinking
Florence over by Crenshaw.

610
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,374
You talk about...
Yeah, all right.

611
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:56,542
Now, we also...

612
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:58,710
This is a contemporary
Mediterranean home.

613
00:29:58,712 --> 00:30:00,611
I think the chandeliers are marvelous,

614
00:30:00,613 --> 00:30:03,814
and there are vast expanses
of land out there.

615
00:30:03,816 --> 00:30:07,551
How many rooms you say...
You say this place has?

616
00:30:07,553 --> 00:30:09,819
Fifteen. And you've seen
every square inch.

617
00:30:12,723 --> 00:30:15,557
And this is the final room of
the house, the master bedroom.

618
00:30:15,559 --> 00:30:17,425
As you can see, it has vaulted ceilings.

619
00:30:17,427 --> 00:30:18,959
Lovely moldings.

620
00:30:18,961 --> 00:30:22,162
A gas-starting, wood-burning
fireplace, that is...

621
00:30:26,434 --> 00:30:28,167
How did this get here?

622
00:30:30,571 --> 00:30:32,971
This is beautiful.

623
00:30:32,973 --> 00:30:33,905
It's a crystal baby bird.

624
00:30:33,907 --> 00:30:36,641
For you.

625
00:30:40,146 --> 00:30:41,879
The asking price of this house

626
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:44,314
is $1.2 million
if you wanna make an offer.

627
00:30:44,316 --> 00:30:47,250
I'd like to offer to take you to dinner.

628
00:30:47,252 --> 00:30:49,552
Mr. Wright, may I explain
something to you?

629
00:30:49,554 --> 00:30:51,787
I have an M.B.A. from Harvard,

630
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:54,089
I run my own business.

631
00:30:54,091 --> 00:30:55,924
There's nothing that you can buy for me

632
00:30:55,926 --> 00:30:57,292
that I can't buy for myself.

633
00:30:57,294 --> 00:30:58,760
So don't waste my time.

634
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:03,030
Well, look, I can't afford this.
This is a big house.

635
00:31:03,032 --> 00:31:04,965
I can't afford it.

636
00:31:04,967 --> 00:31:06,566
I can't afford none of this.

637
00:31:06,568 --> 00:31:08,301
A crystal baby bird?

638
00:31:08,303 --> 00:31:11,203
Yeah, set a motherfucker
back like a big dog.

639
00:31:11,205 --> 00:31:12,604
What kind of game are you playing?

640
00:31:12,606 --> 00:31:14,472
I don't know.
I'm not playing no game.

641
00:31:14,474 --> 00:31:16,807
See, when I came at you
honest and direct,

642
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:19,776
you wouldn't give me the time of day.

643
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:22,312
So you tell me,

644
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:24,280
what kind of game you playing?

645
00:32:25,067 --> 00:32:27,867
That's right.!

646
00:32:27,869 --> 00:32:29,969
Well.

647
00:32:29,971 --> 00:32:32,071
But are we safe here?

648
00:32:32,073 --> 00:32:34,173
Always safe, babe.
Come on now, Brandi.

649
00:32:34,175 --> 00:32:36,074
You in my neighborhood.

650
00:32:36,076 --> 00:32:38,443
You in fine neighborhood.

651
00:32:38,445 --> 00:32:41,479
Let's go, quickly, please.
Okay, okay.

652
00:32:41,481 --> 00:32:43,314
What? Not on my dress,
you know?

653
00:32:43,316 --> 00:32:45,316
It's greasy and everything.

654
00:32:45,318 --> 00:32:46,884
No, it ain't nothing but a little fish.

655
00:32:46,886 --> 00:32:48,719
Ain't nothing but a little fish.

656
00:32:53,624 --> 00:32:55,624
Peekaboo, I see you!

657
00:32:58,295 --> 00:33:00,795
All right.
I'm gonna try this.

658
00:33:00,797 --> 00:33:02,630
Why?

659
00:33:02,632 --> 00:33:05,332
I'm off my diet, but...

660
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,338
This is back to my roots.

661
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:42,228
Dude!

662
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,029
Darnell!

663
00:33:44,031 --> 00:33:46,498
Darnell, pull in the reins!

664
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,666
Take charge!
My God!

665
00:33:48,668 --> 00:33:51,168
- Motherfucker,
- Horsie,

666
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:53,203
Motherfuck...!
Shit!

667
00:33:58,276 --> 00:33:59,875
Shit!

668
00:33:59,877 --> 00:34:02,510
Mother...

669
00:34:02,512 --> 00:34:04,645
Darnell, are you all right?

670
00:34:15,855 --> 00:34:18,255
Are you okay?

671
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:21,825
Motherfucker cool.

672
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:26,261
Why didn't you tell me you couldn't ride?

673
00:34:26,263 --> 00:34:28,796
Heh. I'd have told you
I could ride a monkey,

674
00:34:28,798 --> 00:34:30,697
if I can get close to you.
Heh-heh.

675
00:34:30,699 --> 00:34:32,832
You know, you could've
killed yourself out there.

676
00:34:32,834 --> 00:34:35,634
Hey, hey. Do I get to shoot
the horse if I break a leg?

677
00:34:36,637 --> 00:34:39,137
Shit. Heh. Shit.

678
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:41,005
You know what the important
thing is right now?

679
00:34:41,007 --> 00:34:42,439
Yeah.

680
00:34:42,441 --> 00:34:44,174
To get right back on, right now.

681
00:34:44,176 --> 00:34:45,441
I ain't fucking with that horse.

682
00:34:45,443 --> 00:34:47,609
No, come on.
You gotta get back on him,

683
00:34:47,611 --> 00:34:49,644
or you're gonna get
a mind thing about it.

684
00:34:49,646 --> 00:34:51,846
Damn the mind thing.
You gotta try.

685
00:34:51,848 --> 00:34:53,013
Don't tell me that.
I don't.

686
00:34:53,015 --> 00:34:55,281
Just do it. Come on.

687
00:34:55,283 --> 00:34:58,684
The...? All right, damn.
Look at you.

688
00:34:58,686 --> 00:35:01,486
Now, the first thing you do...
Right.

689
00:35:01,488 --> 00:35:04,188
Is you mount the horse.
That means you sit on the horse.

690
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,689
You know that.

691
00:35:05,691 --> 00:35:07,957
There, baby..

692
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:09,658
Thank you.
Okay, you mount.

693
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,092
Okay.

694
00:35:11,094 --> 00:35:12,760
This is serious business.
Okay.

695
00:35:12,762 --> 00:35:15,462
You get the reins, right?
Yes.

696
00:35:15,464 --> 00:35:17,797
After you got that...

697
00:35:17,799 --> 00:35:19,965
you really concentrate
on your inner thigh,

698
00:35:19,967 --> 00:35:21,599
right up here,

699
00:35:21,601 --> 00:35:23,367
right around to your behind.

700
00:35:23,369 --> 00:35:24,901
Around your ass?
That's right.

701
00:35:24,903 --> 00:35:26,936
Okay, has to be very strong.
Right.

702
00:35:26,938 --> 00:35:29,405
And what you do is,
once you've got the horse going,

703
00:35:29,407 --> 00:35:31,106
once he's listening to you,

704
00:35:31,108 --> 00:35:32,507
it's this motion.
Right.

705
00:35:32,509 --> 00:35:34,408
And that's why people don't understand

706
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:36,076
you've gotta be really, really strong

707
00:35:36,078 --> 00:35:37,744
in your legs with the horse.

708
00:35:37,746 --> 00:35:39,312
Till you're up there.

709
00:35:39,314 --> 00:35:41,647
And you're just riding.
Right.

710
00:35:41,649 --> 00:35:43,515
You listen to him.
That's all you hear.

711
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:44,949
He listens to you.
Right.

712
00:35:44,951 --> 00:35:48,652
And then you really are...

713
00:35:48,654 --> 00:35:51,855
You just become one with the horse,

714
00:35:51,857 --> 00:35:53,323
and that's when you're really safe.

715
00:35:53,325 --> 00:35:55,825
How do I become one with you?

716
00:35:55,827 --> 00:35:57,493
Come on, I just...

717
00:35:57,495 --> 00:36:00,295
That's what... Yeah.

718
00:36:00,297 --> 00:36:02,430
No, this isn't...

719
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,165
Would you...?
Okay.

720
00:36:04,167 --> 00:36:05,966
That's it. That's it.
You know what?

721
00:36:05,968 --> 00:36:07,434
Sorry.
I wanna go.

722
00:36:07,436 --> 00:36:08,835
Let's just go home.

723
00:36:08,837 --> 00:36:10,303
Don't start that shit.

724
00:36:10,305 --> 00:36:12,305
This is the perfect motherfucking place.

725
00:36:12,307 --> 00:36:14,006
Don't start that shit.
No...

726
00:36:14,008 --> 00:36:15,741
What?
Hold it.

727
00:36:15,743 --> 00:36:18,009
What are you afraid of?
What are you afraid of?

728
00:36:18,011 --> 00:36:19,910
I'm not afraid of anything.

729
00:36:19,912 --> 00:36:21,411
Obviously, you're afraid.
I...

730
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:23,980
You bring me up here to go riding,

731
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:26,482
now you don't know me because
motherfucker get physical?

732
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:28,817
Stop trippin.'
Kill that shit.

733
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:30,919
Look, I don't wanna be here.
I don't know you,

734
00:36:30,921 --> 00:36:33,788
I don't know who you are.
I don't trust you.

735
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:36,390
You don't wanna be here?
You're the one that brought me.

736
00:36:36,392 --> 00:36:38,291
You don't wanna be here?
So you're telling me

737
00:36:38,293 --> 00:36:41,127
you trust a horse...
Excuse me.

738
00:36:41,129 --> 00:36:42,495
More than you trust this mother?

739
00:36:42,497 --> 00:36:43,829
That's right, that's right.

740
00:36:43,831 --> 00:36:45,430
Because horses don't disappoint you.

741
00:36:45,432 --> 00:36:47,432
People always disappoint you.

742
00:36:47,434 --> 00:36:50,067
Especially men, especially men.

743
00:36:50,069 --> 00:36:52,002
No, I don't trust you.
Please.

744
00:36:54,172 --> 00:36:56,939
Well, then I guess it's time
to head back to the stables.

745
00:36:56,941 --> 00:36:59,975
Yeah, why don't you?

746
00:36:59,977 --> 00:37:03,978
Please, if you buck,

747
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,612
I'm knocking you the fuck out.

748
00:37:06,781 --> 00:37:09,148
Look...

749
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,416
Don't you know this is a man's game?

750
00:37:11,418 --> 00:37:13,551
Look, girl, look.

751
00:37:13,553 --> 00:37:14,652
You know what, man?

752
00:37:16,789 --> 00:37:18,321
Now, you...
You gonna pull...?

753
00:37:18,323 --> 00:37:20,589
Don't stop.

754
00:37:20,591 --> 00:37:22,891
In your face!
What you gonna do about that?

755
00:37:26,296 --> 00:37:28,929
Heh. Hold up, because
I'm about to wear you out.

756
00:37:30,565 --> 00:37:32,498
You look good even when you sweat.

757
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,100
Look at you.
How you doing?

758
00:37:35,102 --> 00:37:37,202
How you doing?
Fine.

759
00:37:37,204 --> 00:37:39,938
So, beating him?
You know I am.

760
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,806
What time you want me to pick you up?

761
00:37:41,808 --> 00:37:43,641
Five o'clock?

762
00:37:43,643 --> 00:37:45,709
I'll be there five minutes to.
All right. See you then.

763
00:37:45,711 --> 00:37:47,277
See you then.

764
00:37:52,283 --> 00:37:53,982
You ready to finish the game?

765
00:37:53,984 --> 00:37:57,785
Getting a little breather
right now, is that cool?

766
00:37:57,787 --> 00:37:59,787
Can I do that?
What's wrong with you?

767
00:37:59,789 --> 00:38:01,321
Nothing, nothing.

768
00:38:01,323 --> 00:38:03,256
How's your little partner?

769
00:38:03,258 --> 00:38:07,793
I know you ain't tripping
because Reggie came over.

770
00:38:07,795 --> 00:38:09,461
I ain't tripping.
You ain't seen me fall

771
00:38:09,463 --> 00:38:12,096
no-motherfucking-where,
so I ain't tripping.

772
00:38:12,098 --> 00:38:13,697
You seem a little sensitive to me.

773
00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:15,265
Nah, nah.

774
00:38:15,267 --> 00:38:17,433
Can I get a swig of your canteen?

775
00:38:17,435 --> 00:38:18,734
Since you in the service.

776
00:38:18,736 --> 00:38:21,102
No backwash.

777
00:38:25,407 --> 00:38:27,874
Yeah!
That's what it's all about.

778
00:38:27,876 --> 00:38:30,209
Man.

779
00:38:30,211 --> 00:38:31,643
Let me ask you something.

780
00:38:31,645 --> 00:38:33,945
Mia...

781
00:38:33,947 --> 00:38:36,447
do you trust me?

782
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:41,151
Yeah, I trust you.

783
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:44,287
I trust you to do exactly
what you're gonna do.

784
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:47,890
I know you like to sneak money
into your mama's purse,

785
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:50,460
I know you like lots of women,

786
00:38:50,462 --> 00:38:52,562
so I trust you because I don't expect you

787
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:54,697
to do anything different but be Darnell.

788
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,301
So you just gonna
put a motherfucker in a box?

789
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:00,468
Is that what you saying?

790
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,336
I mean, you asked.

791
00:39:02,338 --> 00:39:05,172
<i>Hey, ladies.</i>

792
00:39:05,174 --> 00:39:06,640
Hi.
Welcome.

793
00:39:06,642 --> 00:39:09,242
Welcome to Chocolate City.
My name is Tee.

794
00:39:09,244 --> 00:39:11,510
Hey, Tee.
All right.

795
00:39:11,512 --> 00:39:14,479
We're looking for some new
dancers to fill up the club,

796
00:39:14,481 --> 00:39:16,881
to make the club a lot better,
you know what I'm saying?

797
00:39:16,883 --> 00:39:19,617
We need some, like,
stripper... I mean, exotic

798
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:21,952
type, you know, dancers?

799
00:39:21,954 --> 00:39:24,487
So, we'll start some music,

800
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:26,121
y'all gonna show me what you got, right?

801
00:39:26,123 --> 00:39:27,722
- Yeah.
- All right.

802
00:39:27,724 --> 00:39:30,057
No, y'all gonna
really show me what you got.

803
00:39:30,059 --> 00:39:32,325
I can't hear you. Y'all gonna
show me what you got!

804
00:39:34,128 --> 00:39:35,627
Give me some music, man.

805
00:39:38,164 --> 00:39:40,464
I want everybody to do this.

806
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:47,670
Come on.

807
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,405
I don't have a VIP card.

808
00:41:13,276 --> 00:41:14,675
What you mean you ain't got no...

809
00:41:14,677 --> 00:41:16,977
You know I ain't got no card, nigga.

810
00:41:16,979 --> 00:41:19,713
Well, you...
I ain't playin', Darnell.

811
00:41:19,715 --> 00:41:22,182
Hey! First of all,

812
00:41:22,184 --> 00:41:24,617
don't be loud talking to me

813
00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:27,386
in my motherfucking establishment.

814
00:41:32,992 --> 00:41:34,925
Brandi. Shit.

815
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,499
What you doing here?

816
00:41:46,603 --> 00:41:47,603
Hi.

817
00:41:51,673 --> 00:41:55,474
Now, why would I leave my man
alone here on ladies' night?

818
00:41:55,476 --> 00:41:58,043
First of all, I'm not your man.

819
00:41:58,045 --> 00:42:00,512
Because if I was your man,
we'd be somewhere

820
00:42:00,514 --> 00:42:02,280
watching the sunrise.

821
00:42:02,282 --> 00:42:04,015
Or fucking up headboards.

822
00:42:05,351 --> 00:42:08,151
So I guess I'm not your man.

823
00:42:08,153 --> 00:42:09,785
Honey, don't do this.

824
00:42:09,787 --> 00:42:11,953
Please, I...

825
00:42:11,955 --> 00:42:13,921
You have.
You've been really patient.

826
00:42:13,923 --> 00:42:15,188
And it's gonna pay off.

827
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,689
It's gonna pay off?

828
00:42:16,691 --> 00:42:18,157
When?

829
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:19,992
When, when, when it gonna pay off?

830
00:42:23,697 --> 00:42:25,096
Thought so.

831
00:42:25,098 --> 00:42:26,430
Hey, Darnell.

832
00:42:27,866 --> 00:42:29,999
Hey, hey, hey.

833
00:42:30,001 --> 00:42:31,767
What's up, Darnell?

834
00:42:31,769 --> 00:42:34,202
Nice... club.

835
00:42:34,204 --> 00:42:36,938
Brandi, this is Mia.

836
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:39,340
Mia, this is Brandi.

837
00:42:39,342 --> 00:42:41,408
This is Reggie.

838
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:44,077
Chicken King.
If you want a wing or thigh,

839
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,345
he can get it to you.

840
00:42:46,347 --> 00:42:49,348
Hi.

841
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:52,584
Mia,

842
00:42:52,586 --> 00:42:54,686
why don't you, go on over to the VIP?

843
00:42:54,688 --> 00:42:56,421
I'll send y'all something over to drink.

844
00:42:56,423 --> 00:42:58,523
A little champagne or something.

845
00:42:58,525 --> 00:43:00,358
Thanks, Darnell.
All right, all right.

846
00:43:05,197 --> 00:43:07,931
So why don't you get me
a bottle of champagne?

847
00:43:07,933 --> 00:43:10,333
Hear this, and hear this good.

848
00:43:10,335 --> 00:43:12,301
I'm serious, all right?

849
00:43:12,303 --> 00:43:15,270
I'm not playing games.

850
00:43:15,272 --> 00:43:18,106
I need a woman in my life.
If you ain't ready

851
00:43:18,108 --> 00:43:19,340
to take it to that other level,

852
00:43:19,342 --> 00:43:21,909
stop wasting my time.

853
00:43:21,911 --> 00:43:24,645
Please, stop wasting my time.

854
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:28,262
So look Mia, I,

855
00:44:28,264 --> 00:44:30,464
I hope to be spending
a lot more time with you.

856
00:44:31,767 --> 00:44:33,733
Reggie...

857
00:44:33,735 --> 00:44:36,902
I enjoy spending time with you too.

858
00:44:36,904 --> 00:44:39,437
But, right now I'm not looking

859
00:44:39,439 --> 00:44:41,739
for anything more than friendship.

860
00:44:43,676 --> 00:44:45,942
Well, tell me, is there...?

861
00:44:45,944 --> 00:44:47,643
Is there someone else?

862
00:44:47,645 --> 00:44:49,778
Because I'm not sure
my heart could take that.

863
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:52,980
No. Not exactly.

864
00:44:56,117 --> 00:44:58,917
Had me scared there for a moment.

865
00:44:58,919 --> 00:45:00,485
To friendship?

866
00:45:00,487 --> 00:45:02,119
I'm trying.

867
00:45:06,258 --> 00:45:09,158
Get the fuck out of here,
punk-ass!

868
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,592
Fuck, you're in my place.

869
00:45:10,594 --> 00:45:12,093
Man, you're in my place.

870
00:45:12,095 --> 00:45:13,828
Bug off, man.
The fuck!

871
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:16,096
What the fuck you talking about?
Get the out of here!

872
00:45:16,098 --> 00:45:19,932
Come here, baby.
Get the fuck... You!

873
00:45:24,637 --> 00:45:27,037
Yo, man, get yourself off the dancefloor.

874
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:28,638
What? What?
Hey, hey!

875
00:45:29,774 --> 00:45:31,874
Punk-ass!

876
00:45:31,876 --> 00:45:34,109
Watch your ass too, motherfucker.

877
00:45:34,111 --> 00:45:35,376
Back the fuck up.

878
00:45:35,378 --> 00:45:37,444
Yo, Tyrone, chill out
with that shit, man.

879
00:45:37,446 --> 00:45:39,579
What you talking about?
You're making my dick hard.

880
00:45:41,282 --> 00:45:43,215
It's on!

881
00:45:50,323 --> 00:45:51,322
Look at that.

882
00:45:51,324 --> 00:45:53,991
Get off of me!

883
00:45:53,993 --> 00:45:56,393
Push me out of my club?
Fuck that!

884
00:46:03,201 --> 00:46:05,534
Darnell, you okay?

885
00:46:05,536 --> 00:46:07,269
Yeah. Yeah, I'm cool.
I'm cool.

886
00:46:07,271 --> 00:46:09,437
What about you?

887
00:46:09,439 --> 00:46:12,540
Sure you having a good time
with the Chicken King?

888
00:46:12,542 --> 00:46:15,476
Excuse me.

889
00:46:15,478 --> 00:46:17,211
Don't let him get to you, baby.

890
00:46:17,213 --> 00:46:19,179
I mean, just look at him.

891
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:36,058
Now that's a j-jam.

892
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:39,127
Yeah.
Look,

893
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:41,562
women know brothers
like to hit the skins, right?

894
00:46:41,564 --> 00:46:44,698
But the truth is,
women are freakier than men.

895
00:46:46,501 --> 00:46:49,001
If you can avoid
saying those three words:

896
00:46:49,003 --> 00:46:52,304
"I love you."

897
00:46:52,306 --> 00:46:55,173
A nigga can mack until his dick fall off.

898
00:46:55,175 --> 00:46:57,375
Love, baby.
Love, love. I heard that.

899
00:46:57,377 --> 00:46:58,743
You know what I'm talking about?

900
00:46:58,745 --> 00:47:00,678
Love hurts.
Right.

901
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,047
Besides that, you know what I'm saying?

902
00:47:03,049 --> 00:47:06,617
If you're gonna have a woman,
you got to check 'em,

903
00:47:06,619 --> 00:47:08,652
keep 'em under control,
you know what I'm saying?

904
00:47:08,654 --> 00:47:10,654
That way...
That way what?

905
00:47:10,656 --> 00:47:12,789
- I'm trying to get it out.
- Y'all wait.

906
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:15,057
But that way we got the woman,
is that what you said?

907
00:47:15,059 --> 00:47:18,060
To me...
That ain't what I'm saying.

908
00:47:18,062 --> 00:47:20,529
That way, you know what I'm
saying, you gonna end up

909
00:47:20,531 --> 00:47:22,397
waking up and shit.

910
00:47:22,399 --> 00:47:24,799
Under house arrest, and pussywhipped

911
00:47:24,801 --> 00:47:27,201
like a motherfucker, man.
Right.

912
00:47:27,203 --> 00:47:28,802
You see, it's about balance.

913
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,970
You give 'em too little, they gone,

914
00:47:30,972 --> 00:47:34,406
you give 'em too much, heh.
You can't get rid of 'em.

915
00:47:34,408 --> 00:47:37,041
So you got to even it out.
You got to give 'em just enough.

916
00:47:37,043 --> 00:47:39,643
Just enough for the city.

917
00:47:39,645 --> 00:47:41,478
You know what I mean?

918
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,847
Word. Females all the time

919
00:47:43,849 --> 00:47:45,949
s-sweatin' a man
about b-being a dog.

920
00:47:45,951 --> 00:47:47,984
And it seem like the more you dog 'em,

921
00:47:47,986 --> 00:47:49,719
the more they try to control your ass.

922
00:47:49,721 --> 00:47:51,987
And the m-more they try to
control your ass,

923
00:47:51,989 --> 00:47:54,189
the m-m-more pussy
they give you.

924
00:47:54,191 --> 00:47:56,191
Which... Whichever one
fuck the best,

925
00:47:56,193 --> 00:47:58,193
get to keep the man and the runners up

926
00:47:58,195 --> 00:48:01,496
get to hang around
and call the queen a bitch

927
00:48:01,498 --> 00:48:04,799
and the knight in shining armor,
a-a dog.

928
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:07,835
Just a theory.
What do either of you think?

929
00:48:07,837 --> 00:48:09,870
Man, that's...

930
00:48:09,872 --> 00:48:11,705
Wait a minute.
This motherfucking beer.

931
00:48:11,707 --> 00:48:15,541
Does the beer make you talk
better around this motherfucker?

932
00:48:15,543 --> 00:48:17,509
Sound like Bryant Gumbel.

933
00:48:17,511 --> 00:48:20,845
This motherfucker lost
all stamina and stutter.

934
00:48:23,216 --> 00:48:24,515
What's that?

935
00:48:24,517 --> 00:48:26,984
333 Pacific Coast Highway.

936
00:48:26,986 --> 00:48:28,485
Boom, that's my little boo.

937
00:48:28,487 --> 00:48:30,520
Fellas...
Who's that?

938
00:48:30,522 --> 00:48:32,121
That's Brandi.
Love to hang,

939
00:48:32,123 --> 00:48:34,456
but I got to step.
Man.

940
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:35,723
Hey!
Yo.

941
00:48:35,725 --> 00:48:36,857
Remember the bet.

942
00:48:36,859 --> 00:48:38,758
No, you remember the bet.

943
00:48:43,364 --> 00:48:47,365
Trust him. I just...
This is a whole new...

944
00:48:47,367 --> 00:48:49,767
This is the beginning of my life.

945
00:48:49,769 --> 00:48:51,535
This is it.
It's all new.

946
00:48:51,537 --> 00:48:54,271
I just have to trust, that's it.

947
00:48:54,273 --> 00:48:57,507
Have to really let go.

948
00:48:57,509 --> 00:49:01,310
Just have a good...
Fun. Fun.

949
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:07,948
Fun.

950
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:26,798
Baby, baby.

951
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,232
You so fine.

952
00:49:29,768 --> 00:49:31,300
What's happening?

953
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:32,868
Come in.

954
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:35,703
Yes.

955
00:49:47,713 --> 00:49:50,280
Welcome.

956
00:49:50,282 --> 00:49:53,683
This is funky.
Thank you.

957
00:49:53,685 --> 00:49:56,352
You got your blue water and everything.

958
00:49:56,354 --> 00:49:58,287
Indigo. Yeah.

959
00:49:58,289 --> 00:50:00,856
Well, you can come whenever you...

960
00:50:00,858 --> 00:50:03,124
So would you,

961
00:50:03,126 --> 00:50:05,559
like some chardonnay?

962
00:50:11,867 --> 00:50:13,600
Yes? You would?

963
00:50:13,602 --> 00:50:15,268
Yeah.

964
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:17,637
Got the fruit.

965
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:18,871
You bad..

966
00:50:20,674 --> 00:50:23,241
You bad.

967
00:50:23,243 --> 00:50:26,343
To us, to us, to us, to us.

968
00:50:29,014 --> 00:50:30,947
Get a double ching.

969
00:50:30,949 --> 00:50:33,416
But let's do something
like this, can you?

970
00:50:33,418 --> 00:50:35,518
But that's...
Bring that...

971
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,986
Ain't that for like when they do...?

972
00:50:40,957 --> 00:50:42,689
Lock it in.

973
00:50:47,328 --> 00:50:50,829
It's so good to laugh.
You make me laugh.

974
00:50:50,831 --> 00:50:52,530
Well, you make me laugh.

975
00:50:52,532 --> 00:50:54,164
Don't put that knee out there like that.

976
00:50:54,166 --> 00:50:56,766
Girl, I'm liable to bite that knee.

977
00:50:56,768 --> 00:50:58,801
Man.

978
00:50:58,803 --> 00:51:01,136
You look so sexy.

979
00:51:01,138 --> 00:51:04,372
I'm glad you came to see me.
I...

980
00:51:06,576 --> 00:51:08,475
I just wanted you to know that,

981
00:51:08,477 --> 00:51:10,810
I heard what you said tonight.

982
00:51:10,812 --> 00:51:13,979
And...

983
00:51:13,981 --> 00:51:16,181
I heard you the day we went riding.

984
00:51:17,817 --> 00:51:20,083
What you hear when we went riding?

985
00:51:20,085 --> 00:51:21,451
I just...
What you hear?

986
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:23,453
But there's just a lot of things...

987
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:25,354
Please listen to me.
I am listening.

988
00:51:25,356 --> 00:51:27,555
In my past that you don't know about.

989
00:51:28,958 --> 00:51:30,590
Right, well...

990
00:51:30,592 --> 00:51:33,593
That you don't understand.

991
00:51:33,595 --> 00:51:35,728
And I'm scared.

992
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:37,262
Look, I'm scared too.

993
00:51:37,264 --> 00:51:39,597
Okay? I'm scared.

994
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:42,399
You can see it in my eyes.

995
00:51:42,401 --> 00:51:44,934
But you have to trust me.

996
00:51:44,936 --> 00:51:47,102
I'm here for you.

997
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,236
I'm here for you.

998
00:51:51,306 --> 00:51:52,972
You hear me when I say that?

999
00:51:52,974 --> 00:51:56,442
That's why I'm here.

1000
00:51:56,444 --> 00:51:59,111
Darnell, is there someone?

1001
00:51:59,113 --> 00:52:00,612
What?

1002
00:52:00,614 --> 00:52:02,647
Do you have feelings

1003
00:52:02,649 --> 00:52:05,416
for anybody?
Feelings for...?

1004
00:52:05,418 --> 00:52:08,719
I can't even think
of nobody since I met you.

1005
00:52:08,721 --> 00:52:10,554
Feelings? What?
What kind?

1006
00:52:10,556 --> 00:52:14,124
Because I cannot be hurt.

1007
00:52:14,126 --> 00:52:17,994
It would not be good for me to be hurt.

1008
00:52:20,164 --> 00:52:22,230
I'm shocked and...

1009
00:52:22,232 --> 00:52:23,931
You would think that I would hurt you?

1010
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:25,332
I just wouldn't be good.

1011
00:52:25,334 --> 00:52:28,435
I'm not trying
to hurt you, Brandi. I'm not.

1012
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:31,004
I ain't trying to hurt you, woman.

1013
00:52:31,006 --> 00:52:33,439
I...

1014
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:35,340
But do you want me?

1015
00:52:35,342 --> 00:52:37,709
I want you, baby.
I-I want...

1016
00:52:37,711 --> 00:52:39,644
Wait, listen.
I want you like a motherfucker.

1017
00:52:39,646 --> 00:52:41,746
I want you!

1018
00:52:41,748 --> 00:52:44,081
But do you need me?
You need me?

1019
00:52:44,083 --> 00:52:46,550
I need you.

1020
00:52:46,552 --> 00:52:49,486
I need you.
I need... I need you.

1021
00:52:49,488 --> 00:52:51,754
I need you.
Need you like,

1022
00:52:51,756 --> 00:52:52,955
need you.

1023
00:52:56,827 --> 00:52:59,627
And do you love me?

1024
00:53:12,072 --> 00:53:14,205
I love you.

1025
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:19,443
I... I love you.

1026
00:53:19,445 --> 00:53:21,578
I love you.
Wait, please don't.

1027
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:23,379
Just...
No, no..

1028
00:53:23,381 --> 00:53:25,447
I'm so scared...

1029
00:53:25,449 --> 00:53:27,382
I'm so scared.

1030
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,219
Don't be scared.

1031
00:53:35,757 --> 00:53:37,923
Shit.

1032
00:53:37,925 --> 00:53:38,990
Fuck, I think we-

1033
00:53:38,992 --> 00:53:41,559
Sh...

1034
00:53:43,763 --> 00:53:45,796
Yeah.

1035
00:53:45,798 --> 00:53:47,430
Who says now?

1036
00:54:00,776 --> 00:54:04,511
Wait a minute.
Wait.

1037
00:54:04,513 --> 00:54:06,179
I have something I have to tell you.

1038
00:54:06,181 --> 00:54:07,580
Not now.

1039
00:54:07,582 --> 00:54:10,349
No, it's very, very important
that I tell you this.

1040
00:54:10,351 --> 00:54:11,717
I have to.

1041
00:54:11,719 --> 00:54:13,118
Remember when I was telling you

1042
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:17,689
that I have all these
things in my past, you know,

1043
00:54:17,691 --> 00:54:19,924
well...
Yeah.

1044
00:54:19,926 --> 00:54:21,325
This is about my husband.

1045
00:54:21,327 --> 00:54:23,560
You know, he was a very...

1046
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:27,730
Okay, he was a very abusive man.

1047
00:54:27,732 --> 00:54:29,865
Cruel, insensitive...

1048
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:33,034
He shouldn't be that way.
He shouldn't be that damn way.

1049
00:54:33,036 --> 00:54:34,036
And I killed him.

1050
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:45,613
I killed him.

1051
00:54:47,016 --> 00:54:48,016
You what?

1052
00:54:51,853 --> 00:54:53,118
Do you hate me now?

1053
00:54:55,655 --> 00:54:57,488
Tell me.

1054
00:54:57,490 --> 00:54:58,789
Tell me the truth.

1055
00:54:58,791 --> 00:54:59,956
N-N-Nah.

1056
00:54:59,958 --> 00:55:01,023
No?

1057
00:55:01,025 --> 00:55:02,090
Why would I hate you?

1058
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,527
I mean, if he was abusive
you have to kill his ass.

1059
00:55:09,197 --> 00:55:10,629
Yes.

1060
00:55:10,631 --> 00:55:12,998
You understand.
Does it matter?

1061
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,532
If he was abusive,

1062
00:55:14,534 --> 00:55:15,534
you had to kill his ass.

1063
00:55:18,504 --> 00:55:19,736
Shit.

1064
00:55:42,824 --> 00:55:44,323
<i>Tee's love palace.</i>

1065
00:55:44,325 --> 00:55:45,324
Yo, yo-yo, Tee.

1066
00:55:45,326 --> 00:55:46,425
<i>What's up?</i>

1067
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:48,593
What's up? What's up? What's up?

1068
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:50,027
Yo, what's my name?
<i>Darnell.</i>

1069
00:55:50,029 --> 00:55:52,029
What's my name, boy.
<i>You hit it?</i>

1070
00:55:52,031 --> 00:55:54,097
I'm the man.
That's right, I'm the man.

1071
00:55:54,099 --> 00:55:56,966
That's right, I hit it.
Tore it up, man.

1072
00:55:56,968 --> 00:55:58,767
<i>How was it?</i>
Hey, it was good too.

1073
00:55:58,769 --> 00:56:01,102
Man, baby..

1074
00:56:01,104 --> 00:56:03,304
Look, I'll explain how she work it later,

1075
00:56:03,306 --> 00:56:05,172
but hey, I'm the man.

1076
00:56:05,174 --> 00:56:07,841
Don't forget my name, boy.
I don't play that game.

1077
00:56:07,843 --> 00:56:08,842
<i>Whatever.</i>
That's right.

1078
00:56:08,844 --> 00:56:10,910
That's right.
Look, I got to roll.

1079
00:56:10,912 --> 00:56:13,445
She might want me hit it again.
<i>Get the fuck out of here.</i>

1080
00:56:13,447 --> 00:56:14,446
All right, okay, bye.

1081
00:56:14,448 --> 00:56:15,780
<i>Peace.</i>
Yeah.

1082
00:56:20,686 --> 00:56:22,318
I'm sorry.
Shit.

1083
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,153
I'm so sorry.

1084
00:56:25,189 --> 00:56:27,189
Where did...? What you doing?

1085
00:56:27,191 --> 00:56:28,990
You scared me...

1086
00:56:28,992 --> 00:56:31,158
Ho-ho.

1087
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,492
So what did you hit?

1088
00:56:34,395 --> 00:56:35,927
That was Tee.

1089
00:56:35,929 --> 00:56:38,329
We was talking about a little
softball game back in '76.

1090
00:56:38,331 --> 00:56:39,963
Yeah, yeah.

1091
00:56:39,965 --> 00:56:41,731
Motherfucker, I hit a homerun.
I see.

1092
00:56:41,733 --> 00:56:43,466
Out of the park.
You know what I mean?

1093
00:56:43,468 --> 00:56:45,568
So tell me something.

1094
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:47,090
Do you think we should go back to bed?

1095
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:49,770
Yeah. Yeah,
why don't we do that,

1096
00:56:49,772 --> 00:56:51,304
brother kind of tired.

1097
00:56:51,306 --> 00:56:52,772
Okay.

1098
00:56:53,975 --> 00:56:57,575
Hell, you go and run up on me like that.

1099
00:56:57,577 --> 00:56:59,109
Well, you never know.

1100
00:56:59,111 --> 00:57:00,243
That's right.

1101
00:57:00,245 --> 00:57:01,644
You never know?

1102
00:57:01,646 --> 00:57:02,646
Look at you.

1103
00:57:30,272 --> 00:57:31,971
<i>I trust you.</i>

1104
00:57:31,973 --> 00:57:33,893
<i>I trust you to do
exactly what you're gonna do.</i>

1105
00:57:36,142 --> 00:57:38,041
Who's the man?

1106
00:57:38,043 --> 00:57:40,109
Tell me it was worth it.

1107
00:57:40,111 --> 00:57:41,777
Who's the man?
Yeah, all right.

1108
00:57:41,779 --> 00:57:43,879
I want to hear it.
You the man, you the man.

1109
00:57:43,881 --> 00:57:45,113
I'm the man. Thank you.

1110
00:57:45,115 --> 00:57:47,081
- You the man.
- Definitely the man.

1111
00:57:47,083 --> 00:57:49,616
Well, I gotta give it to you,
young brothers,

1112
00:57:49,618 --> 00:57:51,217
last night's numbers look good enough

1113
00:57:51,219 --> 00:57:52,585
for me to call my lawyer.

1114
00:57:52,587 --> 00:57:54,887
Didn't I tell you?

1115
00:57:54,889 --> 00:57:56,488
Chocolate City making the money.

1116
00:57:58,592 --> 00:58:00,625
Smitty. Smitty.
Hold up.

1117
00:58:00,627 --> 00:58:03,160
So y'all just gonna leave
me up here to do the manual.

1118
00:58:03,162 --> 00:58:05,162
Hey, don't worry, son.
I meant what I said.

1119
00:58:05,164 --> 00:58:07,230
Smitty, hold on, man.

1120
00:58:07,232 --> 00:58:08,297
What is it?

1121
00:58:08,299 --> 00:58:09,298
How's the wife?

1122
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,932
She's fine.

1123
00:58:10,934 --> 00:58:12,300
She's what?

1124
00:58:12,302 --> 00:58:13,934
She's fine.

1125
00:58:13,936 --> 00:58:15,702
Come on.
You mean to tell me

1126
00:58:15,704 --> 00:58:18,137
there don't be no little ladies
you'd like to take?

1127
00:58:18,139 --> 00:58:20,139
You know, to look at or whatever?

1128
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:23,842
Wait a minute, man.

1129
00:58:26,046 --> 00:58:27,766
Are you asking me if I creep
on my old lady?

1130
00:58:29,215 --> 00:58:31,748
Well, back in the day you were the man.

1131
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:34,717
Yeah, yeah, well...
Yeah, back in the day.

1132
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:38,153
I was the man.
Yeah.

1133
00:58:40,056 --> 00:58:43,557
So are you saying you don't
think that I'm the man anymore

1134
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:44,958
because I only got one woman?

1135
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,560
I'm sure your balls
can get a little bored.

1136
00:58:47,562 --> 00:58:49,202
Come here, son,
let me tell you something.

1137
00:58:50,965 --> 00:58:55,066
Ain't a day goes by
I don't see some little booty

1138
00:58:55,068 --> 00:58:56,834
that I wouldn't mind taking a peek at.

1139
00:58:58,404 --> 00:59:01,204
But, man, when I think about
what me and Shirley got going?

1140
00:59:01,206 --> 00:59:02,905
Yeah.

1141
00:59:02,907 --> 00:59:05,707
Ain't nothing...
Nothing worth ruining that for.

1142
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:09,944
Life is about choices, son.

1143
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:11,445
Older your mind gets,

1144
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:13,213
better choices your dick makes.

1145
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,583
Yeah, I can respect that.

1146
00:59:20,888 --> 00:59:22,187
I've been looking for you.

1147
00:59:25,725 --> 00:59:26,757
What my dick thinking?

1148
00:59:30,295 --> 00:59:32,295
You can't just be coming around here

1149
00:59:32,297 --> 00:59:33,596
fronting me like that,

1150
00:59:33,598 --> 00:59:35,397
what's up with the limo and all that?

1151
00:59:35,399 --> 00:59:36,798
Okay, I'll give you a hint.

1152
00:59:38,535 --> 00:59:41,869
I like my men wearing nothing,
or nothing but the best.

1153
00:59:43,405 --> 00:59:45,371
Can I roll with you?

1154
00:59:47,608 --> 00:59:48,873
Sorry for the inconvenience.

1155
00:59:52,612 --> 00:59:54,712
All right, Smitty,
I gotta roll, but look, man,

1156
00:59:54,714 --> 00:59:55,946
my dick ain't that old.

1157
01:00:28,672 --> 01:00:29,771
Don't worry about the club.

1158
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:32,239
Don't worry...
Really.

1159
01:00:32,241 --> 01:00:34,007
You don't have to work
at the club anymore,

1160
01:00:34,009 --> 01:00:35,441
forget about it.

1161
01:00:35,443 --> 01:00:36,909
What you mean? I got to work.

1162
01:00:36,911 --> 01:00:38,410
I'm a man.
Men handle their business.

1163
01:00:38,412 --> 01:00:41,179
I know, baby, but I'll buy you a club.

1164
01:00:41,181 --> 01:00:44,081
In New York, Los Angeles,
doesn't matter, I can afford it.

1165
01:00:48,786 --> 01:00:49,951
Buy me a club?

1166
01:00:51,554 --> 01:00:52,719
Thank you.

1167
01:00:52,721 --> 01:00:54,520
Nah, I'll buy you a club.

1168
01:00:54,522 --> 01:00:55,787
I want to do whatever it takes

1169
01:00:55,789 --> 01:00:57,555
so we can spend all of our time together.

1170
01:00:57,557 --> 01:00:59,256
Understand?

1171
01:00:59,258 --> 01:01:01,091
All of it.

1172
01:01:01,093 --> 01:01:03,993
Baby, ain't that much time in the world.

1173
01:01:03,995 --> 01:01:07,062
We can't spend all our time
together, you know.

1174
01:01:07,064 --> 01:01:08,763
Get a sandwich here and there.

1175
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:11,132
Okay. Here's...
Here's what we'll do.

1176
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:12,600
Why don't you take the car, drop me off,

1177
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:14,034
go handle your business,

1178
01:01:14,036 --> 01:01:16,502
and then come back for
a candlelight dinner.

1179
01:01:18,973 --> 01:01:21,372
I... Well...
I'll try to get...

1180
01:01:22,608 --> 01:01:24,007
It's my birthday.

1181
01:01:28,813 --> 01:01:30,245
When did it become your birthday?

1182
01:01:30,247 --> 01:01:32,447
All day long.

1183
01:01:32,449 --> 01:01:35,616
Well, since it's your birthday,

1184
01:01:35,618 --> 01:01:38,018
brother be back.

1185
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:39,152
Yeah.

1186
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:40,154
Brother be back.

1187
01:01:52,163 --> 01:01:53,629
Yeah. Give it to me.

1188
01:01:57,334 --> 01:01:58,334
Is that Rodney?

1189
01:02:00,836 --> 01:02:02,435
That's his car?

1190
01:02:02,437 --> 01:02:03,602
I don't know.

1191
01:02:03,604 --> 01:02:04,769
And has he paid?

1192
01:02:04,771 --> 01:02:05,836
I don't know.

1193
01:02:08,106 --> 01:02:09,538
Mama, it's Darnell.

1194
01:02:11,341 --> 01:02:14,275
If you think you're chaperoning
your sister to this prom,

1195
01:02:14,277 --> 01:02:15,409
you got another thing coming.

1196
01:02:15,411 --> 01:02:17,077
Where are you going?

1197
01:02:17,079 --> 01:02:19,145
I just came out to see how
beautiful my sister looked.

1198
01:02:19,147 --> 01:02:20,513
Ain't she pretty?

1199
01:02:20,515 --> 01:02:22,915
- Look at you, girl.
- Hey... Hey, Mama.

1200
01:02:22,917 --> 01:02:24,516
She da bomb, right, girl?

1201
01:02:24,518 --> 01:02:26,117
Let me get this picture.

1202
01:02:26,119 --> 01:02:27,618
Come on.
You look like a model.

1203
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:28,852
Thank you.
Come on.

1204
01:02:28,854 --> 01:02:30,486
Watch my hair.

1205
01:02:30,488 --> 01:02:32,488
I ain't touch your hair, girl.
Get the picture.

1206
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:33,956
Don't give me that stuff,

1207
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:36,058
act like you love each other.
Come on. Give it to me.

1208
01:02:37,327 --> 01:02:39,827
That's wonderful.
That's so good.

1209
01:02:39,829 --> 01:02:41,728
Yes, yes, yes.

1210
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:43,296
Give it to me.

1211
01:02:43,298 --> 01:02:45,831
Mama, that's Rodney, I gotta go,
I'm not ready, come on.

1212
01:02:45,833 --> 01:02:47,799
Okay, okay, okay.
I'll take care of it.

1213
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:00,741
What's happening, baby?

1214
01:03:04,913 --> 01:03:06,946
It's all good.

1215
01:03:06,948 --> 01:03:08,414
What's happening, man.
What's up?

1216
01:03:08,416 --> 01:03:10,749
Here to pick up my little
snuggle bunny, man, what's up?

1217
01:03:10,751 --> 01:03:12,884
All right, right on, right on.
What's happening?

1218
01:03:12,886 --> 01:03:14,452
Not much, man.
Just chilling, you know.

1219
01:03:14,454 --> 01:03:15,753
Right. Right.

1220
01:03:15,755 --> 01:03:17,588
So you Rodney Smalls?

1221
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:20,424
Yeah, man. I'm the brother they
call "Rodney," man. What's up?

1222
01:03:20,426 --> 01:03:22,826
Okay. Yeah, well, my sister's
back there, you know,

1223
01:03:22,828 --> 01:03:24,794
just finishing up the last little touches

1224
01:03:24,796 --> 01:03:26,162
for the prom tonight.

1225
01:03:28,132 --> 01:03:29,898
How's your brother Cleofus?

1226
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:32,066
Man, you know Cleo?
He back in the crib

1227
01:03:32,068 --> 01:03:33,667
sitting with about 50 buck naked honeys

1228
01:03:33,669 --> 01:03:35,635
getting physical
up in that thing, you know.

1229
01:03:35,637 --> 01:03:37,403
I couldn't stay because
I got things to do,

1230
01:03:37,405 --> 01:03:38,337
you know what I'm saying?

1231
01:03:38,339 --> 01:03:40,639
Right. Right.

1232
01:03:40,641 --> 01:03:42,273
Let... Let me holler
at you for a sec.

1233
01:03:42,275 --> 01:03:44,308
Okay, man.

1234
01:03:46,645 --> 01:03:50,780
Look. I'm gonna get right
to the point.

1235
01:03:50,782 --> 01:03:54,716
You treading on thin ice,
taking my sister to this prom.

1236
01:03:54,718 --> 01:03:56,584
H-hold up,
Darnell, man, look.

1237
01:03:56,586 --> 01:03:57,785
No disrespecting you, man,

1238
01:03:57,787 --> 01:03:59,119
but I know where you going with it.

1239
01:03:59,121 --> 01:04:00,820
I ain't nothing like my brother Cleofus.

1240
01:04:02,623 --> 01:04:04,489
Look, I love my sister, I do.

1241
01:04:04,491 --> 01:04:05,957
I love my sister dearly.

1242
01:04:08,127 --> 01:04:09,593
Have my sister home by midnight.

1243
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:11,595
Midnight?
Man, you got to be playing, man.

1244
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:13,930
Midnight, that's when everybody
get to grooving and partying.

1245
01:04:13,932 --> 01:04:15,164
Getting their party on, man,

1246
01:04:15,166 --> 01:04:17,399
you got to be playing with me.
Come on.

1247
01:04:17,401 --> 01:04:19,100
I look like I'm playing?

1248
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:25,270
I don't give a fuck
if she lose a glass slipper,

1249
01:04:26,406 --> 01:04:28,406
please, have her home by midnight.

1250
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:32,409
Hi, Rodney.

1251
01:04:32,411 --> 01:04:35,211
Hoo-hoo, lord have mercy, girl.

1252
01:04:35,213 --> 01:04:36,545
Mama, this is Rodney.

1253
01:04:36,547 --> 01:04:38,480
How you doing?
Very nice to meet you, Rodney.

1254
01:04:38,482 --> 01:04:39,914
Yes, I see where she gets it from.

1255
01:04:39,916 --> 01:04:41,415
Thank you so much.
Yes, indeed.

1256
01:04:41,417 --> 01:04:42,816
Give you this.

1257
01:04:42,818 --> 01:04:45,051
Mama, don't fuss.

1258
01:04:45,053 --> 01:04:46,053
Thank you.

1259
01:04:46,954 --> 01:04:48,653
Bye.

1260
01:04:48,655 --> 01:04:50,521
Hey.

1261
01:04:50,523 --> 01:04:53,290
Don't you trip. Right.
Have a good time, all right?

1262
01:04:53,292 --> 01:04:54,758
Thanks, Dar.

1263
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,760
Have the best time you can,
baby, you look beautiful.

1264
01:04:56,762 --> 01:04:58,228
Thank you.
Don't worry, Mama.

1265
01:04:58,230 --> 01:04:59,629
We gonna have the best time.
Bye.

1266
01:05:01,132 --> 01:05:02,531
You got the car washed, Rodney.

1267
01:05:06,536 --> 01:05:08,469
Her daddy be so proud.

1268
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:10,370
I know, Mama, I know.

1269
01:05:10,372 --> 01:05:12,205
I know she look good.

1270
01:05:12,207 --> 01:05:13,906
You did a good job with
the hair, you know that.

1271
01:05:13,908 --> 01:05:15,774
Yeah? Thank you.

1272
01:05:20,146 --> 01:05:23,413
So you got yourself a rich one this time.

1273
01:05:23,415 --> 01:05:25,114
What you talking about?

1274
01:05:25,116 --> 01:05:27,950
Don't play me, boy.
These clothes, that limousine.

1275
01:05:27,952 --> 01:05:30,152
I did not raise you
to be a gigolo, Darnell.

1276
01:05:31,588 --> 01:05:33,921
Come on, Mama, I know what I'm doing.

1277
01:05:33,923 --> 01:05:36,957
You know what you doing.
You know what you doing.

1278
01:05:36,959 --> 01:05:38,558
Yes, I do.

1279
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:41,193
Well, do you know that Mia's
going back into the Air Force?

1280
01:05:57,410 --> 01:05:59,042
But you don't want that job.

1281
01:05:59,044 --> 01:06:01,544
Well, what do you expect?
What do I expect...

1282
01:06:01,546 --> 01:06:04,446
Hey, I need to talk to you.

1283
01:06:04,448 --> 01:06:06,781
Just ignore his ass, Mia,
and keep on walking.

1284
01:06:06,783 --> 01:06:08,783
We're trying to go bowling.

1285
01:06:08,785 --> 01:06:10,718
Well, look, let me run you down...

1286
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:11,919
Let me run you down in the limo.

1287
01:06:11,921 --> 01:06:13,954
Right quick, all right?
I'll run you down.

1288
01:06:13,956 --> 01:06:15,722
That's all right, I'd...
I'd rather walk.

1289
01:06:15,724 --> 01:06:16,956
I'm not talking to you.

1290
01:06:16,958 --> 01:06:19,425
It don't matter.

1291
01:06:19,427 --> 01:06:20,759
Look, look, look.
Let me...

1292
01:06:20,761 --> 01:06:22,761
Let me ask you something.
Hold up. Hold up.

1293
01:06:22,763 --> 01:06:24,796
Just... Just give
it to me straight.

1294
01:06:24,798 --> 01:06:26,430
Is it true?

1295
01:06:26,432 --> 01:06:27,764
You going back in the service?

1296
01:06:29,334 --> 01:06:30,433
What do you care?

1297
01:06:30,435 --> 01:06:32,234
What you mean, what I care?

1298
01:06:32,236 --> 01:06:33,835
Girl, I been caring since...

1299
01:06:33,837 --> 01:06:36,037
Since motherfucker been
buying you Jujubes.

1300
01:06:36,039 --> 01:06:37,938
I mean, since you had
a rattle in your mouth.

1301
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:39,306
I care.

1302
01:06:44,379 --> 01:06:46,078
I'll catch up with you?

1303
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,512
Yeah.

1304
01:06:47,514 --> 01:06:49,547
Wasting your time, Mia.

1305
01:06:49,549 --> 01:06:50,948
She ain't wasting her time.

1306
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:53,050
You better stop feeding
that old negative bullshit.

1307
01:06:53,052 --> 01:06:54,251
Know what?
Don't treat

1308
01:06:54,253 --> 01:06:56,253
my cousin like she one
of your ho's, Darnell.

1309
01:06:56,255 --> 01:06:57,921
Ain't nobody say nothing about no ho's.

1310
01:06:57,923 --> 01:06:59,389
Peaches, Peaches, I'll handle it.

1311
01:06:59,391 --> 01:07:01,924
Take care of yourself.

1312
01:07:01,926 --> 01:07:03,425
You take care of yourself.

1313
01:07:03,427 --> 01:07:05,260
She ain't going nowhere.

1314
01:07:05,262 --> 01:07:06,561
Whatever.
She with this man.

1315
01:07:06,563 --> 01:07:07,995
Stupid nigga.

1316
01:07:07,997 --> 01:07:09,563
What?
Stupid nigga.

1317
01:07:09,565 --> 01:07:12,432
Okay, you wanted to talk, so let's talk.

1318
01:07:12,434 --> 01:07:14,267
What's up with the suit and the limo?

1319
01:07:14,269 --> 01:07:15,334
I told you, you know.

1320
01:07:15,336 --> 01:07:16,768
Me and Tee gonna change our image,

1321
01:07:16,770 --> 01:07:18,269
because we trying to hype up,

1322
01:07:18,271 --> 01:07:19,937
so, you know, I...

1323
01:07:19,939 --> 01:07:21,238
We thought it might be a good look.

1324
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:22,240
And the limo?

1325
01:07:24,875 --> 01:07:26,708
All right, Mia,

1326
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:28,810
this shit don't belong to me.

1327
01:07:30,013 --> 01:07:31,345
Brandi paid for all this shit.

1328
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:33,681
The suit, the-the limo...

1329
01:07:33,683 --> 01:07:37,084
Mia, hold on, now. Please.
Please, I don't mean to gripe.

1330
01:07:37,086 --> 01:07:38,685
I don't like that.
Hold on. Listen.

1331
01:07:38,687 --> 01:07:39,652
It don't mean nothing to me.

1332
01:07:39,654 --> 01:07:41,620
That's why I'm here.

1333
01:07:41,622 --> 01:07:43,521
That's why I'm here.

1334
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:45,989
You don't believe me?

1335
01:07:45,991 --> 01:07:48,291
Look, I'll prove it.
Shit don't mean...

1336
01:07:48,293 --> 01:07:49,825
I'll throw all this shit out.

1337
01:07:49,827 --> 01:07:51,259
Who wants it?

1338
01:07:51,261 --> 01:07:53,794
The neighborhood want this shit?

1339
01:07:53,796 --> 01:07:55,156
I want to throw all this shit out.

1340
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:01,133
Brandi even bought this shit.

1341
01:08:26,157 --> 01:08:28,824
Darnell, remember when we were kids

1342
01:08:28,826 --> 01:08:31,693
and we used to lay in the back
of my grandma's truck?

1343
01:08:31,695 --> 01:08:35,430
Yeah, we used to call
it a spaceship, right?

1344
01:08:35,432 --> 01:08:40,100
Yep. And you used
to let me be the captain.

1345
01:08:40,102 --> 01:08:41,534
Well, I had no choice.

1346
01:08:41,536 --> 01:08:44,236
You said, "It's my grandma's,
and my grandma said"

1347
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:45,604
"this is my spaceship,

1348
01:08:45,606 --> 01:08:47,939
and ladies got to have
a spaceship."

1349
01:08:47,941 --> 01:08:49,573
What was the name of that spaceship?

1350
01:08:50,642 --> 01:08:52,575
We called it<i> Destiny.</i>

1351
01:08:57,781 --> 01:08:58,913
You know what was wild?

1352
01:09:00,583 --> 01:09:03,049
I never thought I could
be with one woman.

1353
01:09:05,153 --> 01:09:06,752
You starting to think?

1354
01:09:06,754 --> 01:09:10,655
You...
You gonna go there on me.

1355
01:09:10,657 --> 01:09:13,824
Here, on the romantic cliff?

1356
01:09:13,826 --> 01:09:15,258
Look, let me ask you a question,

1357
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:16,892
because, I mean, this is...
This is real.

1358
01:09:16,894 --> 01:09:17,893
Okay.
Back in the day,

1359
01:09:17,895 --> 01:09:18,895
when we were young,

1360
01:09:21,931 --> 01:09:24,297
could I...?
Could I have had you?

1361
01:09:29,636 --> 01:09:30,968
Maybe.

1362
01:09:32,304 --> 01:09:33,670
If you'd been ready.

1363
01:09:35,273 --> 01:09:36,872
I'm ready now.

1364
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:41,110
Think so?

1365
01:09:45,847 --> 01:09:47,046
I know so.

1366
01:09:50,384 --> 01:09:51,384
Come here.

1367
01:10:23,911 --> 01:10:26,044
Are you...?

1368
01:10:26,046 --> 01:10:27,126
Are you going to ask me in?

1369
01:10:30,783 --> 01:10:32,263
I don't think I'm ready for that yet.

1370
01:10:33,985 --> 01:10:35,150
What you talking about?

1371
01:10:36,753 --> 01:10:39,086
You...
Are you saying...?

1372
01:10:39,088 --> 01:10:41,888
No, no, no, no. No.
I wanted to...

1373
01:10:44,325 --> 01:10:46,291
I'm thirsty, so I figure
we can go in there,

1374
01:10:46,293 --> 01:10:47,792
drink some Fruitopia, and then plus,

1375
01:10:47,794 --> 01:10:49,093
because I care,

1376
01:10:49,095 --> 01:10:50,961
I want to make sure
ain't nobody in the house.

1377
01:10:50,963 --> 01:10:51,995
I got to break 'em down.

1378
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:55,765
Come on. You know...

1379
01:10:55,767 --> 01:10:57,407
You know I just don't want it to end now.

1380
01:11:04,141 --> 01:11:05,607
All right.

1381
01:11:05,609 --> 01:11:07,775
Yeah? What?

1382
01:11:07,777 --> 01:11:09,710
Just for some Fruitopia.

1383
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:51,915
What's happening?

1384
01:11:51,917 --> 01:11:53,549
What's happening?

1385
01:12:13,735 --> 01:12:16,736
Don't move, all right?

1386
01:12:16,738 --> 01:12:18,104
I'll get that.

1387
01:12:36,086 --> 01:12:38,119
Darnell?

1388
01:12:38,121 --> 01:12:39,753
Hold on.
Somebody selling cookies.

1389
01:12:49,364 --> 01:12:50,529
Is everything okay?

1390
01:12:51,865 --> 01:12:53,297
Yeah, baby.

1391
01:12:53,299 --> 01:12:55,432
I'm just, getting my change
back from the cookies.

1392
01:13:07,644 --> 01:13:09,377
Everything okay?

1393
01:13:09,379 --> 01:13:10,611
Yeah, everything's cool.

1394
01:13:11,914 --> 01:13:15,748
So, let's pick up where we left off.

1395
01:13:17,451 --> 01:13:20,285
I was thinking,

1396
01:13:20,287 --> 01:13:21,853
maybe we should wait a while.

1397
01:13:25,458 --> 01:13:28,058
I can respect that.
I can respect that.

1398
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:29,559
Can a brother get some breakfast?

1399
01:13:29,561 --> 01:13:32,228
I mean, some, grits,

1400
01:13:32,230 --> 01:13:34,263
some salmon croquettes.
Something up in here.

1401
01:13:34,265 --> 01:13:36,898
Yeah, I think I can hook up something.

1402
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:38,766
That's what I'm talking about.

1403
01:13:44,006 --> 01:13:45,071
Brandi.

1404
01:13:47,075 --> 01:13:48,908
Look.

1405
01:13:48,910 --> 01:13:50,275
I'm sorry about last night.

1406
01:13:52,879 --> 01:13:54,344
Something really important came up.

1407
01:13:56,681 --> 01:13:58,113
I don't know how to say this...

1408
01:13:58,115 --> 01:13:59,514
You don't have to say anything.

1409
01:13:59,516 --> 01:14:01,382
We had fun while it lasted.

1410
01:14:01,384 --> 01:14:03,384
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, that...

1411
01:14:03,386 --> 01:14:05,686
That-That's what
I was going to say.

1412
01:14:05,688 --> 01:14:07,888
Hey, look. You know?
Maybe we just be friends,

1413
01:14:07,890 --> 01:14:10,290
you know, be real cool,
real tight like that, you know?

1414
01:14:10,292 --> 01:14:12,759
Couldn't agree with you more.

1415
01:14:12,761 --> 01:14:14,761
I was starting to get very bored.

1416
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:17,896
Bored?

1417
01:14:19,232 --> 01:14:21,031
That's cold.

1418
01:14:21,033 --> 01:14:22,265
"Friends."

1419
01:14:26,104 --> 01:14:27,436
I like that much better.

1420
01:14:32,709 --> 01:14:34,608
Think I got something
that belongs to you.

1421
01:14:49,522 --> 01:14:52,089
<i>So, brother moving on.</i>

1422
01:14:52,091 --> 01:14:53,323
So a brother's moving on,

1423
01:14:53,325 --> 01:14:55,191
that's all you got to say
after all this time?

1424
01:14:55,193 --> 01:14:56,225
Fuck you, Darnell.

1425
01:14:56,227 --> 01:14:58,060
You don't even deserve a woman like me.

1426
01:14:58,062 --> 01:15:00,195
You can't even handle me,
that's what your problem is,

1427
01:15:00,197 --> 01:15:01,829
you little weak-ass
motherfucker,

1428
01:15:01,831 --> 01:15:03,497
I don't need your
dog-ass anyway, Darnell,

1429
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:04,899
you ain't shit.

1430
01:15:07,837 --> 01:15:10,103
I'm-a take Marvis
to Disneyland. Look.

1431
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:12,038
We gonna go camping.
It's wrong, Darnell,

1432
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:13,873
what you playing with people's minds.

1433
01:15:13,875 --> 01:15:15,674
I'm not playing with nobody's mind.

1434
01:15:15,676 --> 01:15:18,510
Especially not the kid's.

1435
01:15:18,512 --> 01:15:20,612
It's just things didn't
work out the way I planned.

1436
01:15:20,614 --> 01:15:22,614
Now, don't be like that.

1437
01:15:22,616 --> 01:15:25,283
After all your damn promises.

1438
01:15:25,285 --> 01:15:27,184
Just get out of my face, nigga.

1439
01:15:27,186 --> 01:15:28,518
Now, don't get...
N...

1440
01:15:30,255 --> 01:15:31,520
Roll, punk.

1441
01:15:33,457 --> 01:15:34,856
Gwen, you gonna let your...

1442
01:15:40,496 --> 01:15:43,096
Me and Mia, man. We...
We're making our thing

1443
01:15:43,098 --> 01:15:45,098
a little tighter right now
and that's real.

1444
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:47,633
When I told you

1445
01:15:47,635 --> 01:15:48,967
that the older your mind gets,

1446
01:15:48,969 --> 01:15:50,535
the better choices your dick makes,

1447
01:15:50,537 --> 01:15:53,804
I had no idea you was gonna
turn around this quick.

1448
01:15:53,806 --> 01:15:55,038
I mean, last time I talked to you,

1449
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:56,572
you was talking about:

1450
01:15:56,574 --> 01:15:58,807
"My dick ain't that old, Smitty,
my dick ain't that old."

1451
01:15:58,809 --> 01:16:00,341
Now you're serious.

1452
01:16:00,343 --> 01:16:03,243
Serious as a heart attack, Smitty.

1453
01:16:03,245 --> 01:16:05,511
You know I don't want one of them.

1454
01:16:09,116 --> 01:16:10,748
<i>Hey, this is Mia.</i>

1455
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:11,910
<i>Leave a message at the beep.</i>

1456
01:16:12,751 --> 01:16:15,818
Mia. This is Darnell.

1457
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:17,519
I know you probably out with Peaches,

1458
01:16:17,521 --> 01:16:21,788
so...

1459
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:25,091
I-I was giving you a call...

1460
01:16:25,093 --> 01:16:26,492
I was giving you a call

1461
01:16:26,494 --> 01:16:28,494
to let you know I was thinking about you.

1462
01:16:28,496 --> 01:16:31,230
So, get back if you...

1463
01:16:31,232 --> 01:16:32,798
When you get a chance.

1464
01:16:35,169 --> 01:16:36,534
Later.

1465
01:16:57,352 --> 01:16:58,384
Fuck.

1466
01:17:03,723 --> 01:17:04,822
You out your fucking mind?

1467
01:17:06,559 --> 01:17:08,992
What are you doing here, Brandi?

1468
01:17:08,994 --> 01:17:10,927
Good morning.

1469
01:17:10,929 --> 01:17:13,262
Darnell, you scared me.

1470
01:17:13,264 --> 01:17:16,265
What do you mean, I scared you?
What are you doing, Brandi?

1471
01:17:16,267 --> 01:17:18,333
Well, I-I made you some bacon.

1472
01:17:18,335 --> 01:17:20,501
And I was making pancakes,
but then I realized

1473
01:17:20,503 --> 01:17:23,170
I didn't know whether you like
them dark, light, or fluffy.

1474
01:17:23,172 --> 01:17:25,305
You didn't know if I like 'em
light, dark, or fluffy.

1475
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:27,173
Brandi, get your shit

1476
01:17:27,175 --> 01:17:28,974
and get the fuck out now.
I'm not playing.

1477
01:17:28,976 --> 01:17:31,109
Honey, you're cranky.

1478
01:17:31,111 --> 01:17:32,510
You just need coffee.

1479
01:17:32,512 --> 01:17:34,111
Take your biscuit batter

1480
01:17:34,113 --> 01:17:35,545
and your fucking burnt bacon

1481
01:17:35,547 --> 01:17:37,480
and step the fuck off, Brandi.

1482
01:17:38,950 --> 01:17:41,317
You said you loved me.

1483
01:17:41,319 --> 01:17:42,951
I saw how you looked
at me and you look...

1484
01:17:42,953 --> 01:17:44,919
You just don't feel good this morning.

1485
01:17:44,921 --> 01:17:47,321
Come on, honey, just hold me.

1486
01:17:47,323 --> 01:17:49,723
Get your mo...
The fuck...

1487
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:57,729
Now, stop playing fucking games

1488
01:17:57,731 --> 01:17:59,731
and get the fuck out.

1489
01:18:04,103 --> 01:18:06,703
You put your hands on the wrong woman.

1490
01:18:20,118 --> 01:18:22,084
Gonna put me on the VIP list?

1491
01:18:22,086 --> 01:18:23,385
Yeah.

1492
01:18:23,387 --> 01:18:24,886
I don't like standing in no line.

1493
01:18:24,888 --> 01:18:26,220
Come to the club, I'm telling you,

1494
01:18:26,222 --> 01:18:27,821
Chocolate City...

1495
01:18:27,823 --> 01:18:29,189
Shit. Shit.

1496
01:18:43,238 --> 01:18:44,604
What happened to your clothes?

1497
01:18:46,207 --> 01:18:49,307
Too much...
Too much motherfucking starch.

1498
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:52,876
You all right?
Too much motherfucking starch.

1499
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:54,979
You okay?

1500
01:19:00,417 --> 01:19:01,749
I beat ya.

1501
01:19:01,751 --> 01:19:02,783
That's cold.

1502
01:19:02,785 --> 01:19:04,885
It is.
That's cold.

1503
01:19:04,887 --> 01:19:06,527
Man, you wasn't even
into the game anyway.

1504
01:19:08,156 --> 01:19:09,555
What's up, man?
What's going on?

1505
01:19:09,557 --> 01:19:13,458
I'm caught up in a real life.

1506
01:19:13,460 --> 01:19:16,527
<i>Fatal Attraction</i>
up in this motherfucker, man.

1507
01:19:21,565 --> 01:19:23,598
<i>Hold on, let me break this down for you.</i>

1508
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:27,634
You're going through what
I call "pussy withdrawal."

1509
01:19:27,636 --> 01:19:29,569
"Pussy withdrawal."

1510
01:19:29,571 --> 01:19:31,537
No, see, check it out.

1511
01:19:31,539 --> 01:19:33,138
<i>You're used to a smorgasbord of honeys,</i>

1512
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:36,608
<i>and now you're just with Mia.</i>

1513
01:19:36,610 --> 01:19:39,110
<i>Know what I mean?
You on lockdown.</i>

1514
01:19:39,112 --> 01:19:41,712
I'm saying the refrigerator is closed.

1515
01:19:41,714 --> 01:19:42,946
The lights are out.

1516
01:19:42,948 --> 01:19:44,247
- Man.
- Hey, Darnell,

1517
01:19:44,249 --> 01:19:45,915
the phone, man.

1518
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:50,085
Hi-di-ho.

1519
01:19:50,087 --> 01:19:51,219
Hoo-hoo.

1520
01:19:51,221 --> 01:19:52,954
Take this here, man.

1521
01:19:52,956 --> 01:19:54,922
You ain't one of the Sylvers.

1522
01:19:54,924 --> 01:19:57,057
Man, you better hush before
your ass get fired.

1523
01:19:57,059 --> 01:19:58,591
I'm about to own this motherfucker.

1524
01:19:58,593 --> 01:20:00,225
Hush. Hush the fuck up.

1525
01:20:00,227 --> 01:20:01,359
All right.

1526
01:20:01,361 --> 01:20:02,727
<i>Darnell Wright?</i>

1527
01:20:02,729 --> 01:20:04,128
Yeah, this is D.

1528
01:20:04,130 --> 01:20:05,896
<i>Yes, this is Wilshire Hospital.</i>

1529
01:20:05,898 --> 01:20:07,530
<i>Mia Williams has been in an accident,</i>

1530
01:20:07,532 --> 01:20:09,430
<i>she asked if you...</i>

1531
01:20:15,203 --> 01:20:16,702
My bad.

1532
01:20:16,704 --> 01:20:19,404
- Excuse me...
- Hey, you can't park there.

1533
01:20:19,406 --> 01:20:20,872
What the heck's the matter with you?

1534
01:20:20,874 --> 01:20:22,106
Learn to drive!

1535
01:20:30,048 --> 01:20:31,147
Mia.

1536
01:20:31,916 --> 01:20:32,916
Mia, baby.

1537
01:20:36,053 --> 01:20:37,752
Darnell.

1538
01:20:40,890 --> 01:20:42,055
Brandi, what...?

1539
01:20:42,057 --> 01:20:44,223
What are you doing?
I got a call and Mia

1540
01:20:44,225 --> 01:20:46,725
was down here in the hospital,
she was hurt.

1541
01:20:46,727 --> 01:20:48,226
Would you have come
if you knew it was me.

1542
01:20:48,228 --> 01:20:50,394
What?

1543
01:20:50,396 --> 01:20:52,529
You think the hospital...
This is a game, Brandi?

1544
01:20:57,334 --> 01:20:58,833
What happened to you?

1545
01:20:58,835 --> 01:21:00,901
You didn't have to do that, Darnell.

1546
01:21:00,903 --> 01:21:03,203
You know how much I love you.

1547
01:21:03,205 --> 01:21:04,437
Excuse...?

1548
01:21:04,439 --> 01:21:06,038
Excuse me?
Do what?

1549
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:07,639
No, no, no, no,
don't-don't-don't...

1550
01:21:09,075 --> 01:21:11,241
I'm sorry.

1551
01:21:11,243 --> 01:21:12,942
I'm so sorry, honey.

1552
01:21:12,944 --> 01:21:14,343
No, they made me do it.

1553
01:21:14,345 --> 01:21:15,711
I didn't want to do it.
Forgive me.

1554
01:21:15,713 --> 01:21:17,512
Darnell, forgive me.

1555
01:21:17,514 --> 01:21:18,746
This is bullshit.

1556
01:21:18,748 --> 01:21:19,747
Darnell Wright?

1557
01:21:19,749 --> 01:21:21,248
Yeah, I'm Darnell Wright, wha...?

1558
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:23,450
You're under arrest.
Officer, I think you got a...

1559
01:21:23,452 --> 01:21:26,085
You making...
You making... Shit.

1560
01:21:26,087 --> 01:21:28,053
Please, don't hurt him.
Don't hurt him.

1561
01:21:28,055 --> 01:21:30,021
Can and will be used against
you in a court of law.

1562
01:21:30,023 --> 01:21:31,889
Look at this shit, Brandi.
You stop playing.

1563
01:21:31,891 --> 01:21:33,757
I love him.

1564
01:21:33,759 --> 01:21:36,726
This is bullshit...
He's fine, ma'am, he's fine.

1565
01:21:36,728 --> 01:21:39,228
You gonna let me go on like this...

1566
01:21:40,064 --> 01:21:41,496
Ouch.

1567
01:21:44,934 --> 01:21:47,567
<i>Dr. Roderick, please call...</i>

1568
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:49,670
I know you didn't touch her, baby.

1569
01:21:49,672 --> 01:21:54,141
I raised you better than that.

1570
01:21:54,143 --> 01:21:57,777
But you better be thankful
that they didn't press charges.

1571
01:21:57,779 --> 01:21:59,211
The lord must have been watching out over

1572
01:21:59,213 --> 01:22:01,012
your stupid ass.

1573
01:22:03,816 --> 01:22:06,850
Hey, I cut her off.

1574
01:22:06,852 --> 01:22:09,652
She was on some, like,
old crazy stuff, Mom.

1575
01:22:09,654 --> 01:22:11,820
Just wild. Buck wild.

1576
01:22:11,822 --> 01:22:13,288
Now you see what I been telling you

1577
01:22:13,290 --> 01:22:15,657
about these young girls
you running around with.

1578
01:22:19,595 --> 01:22:21,094
Stay here.

1579
01:22:21,096 --> 01:22:23,062
See, this is what I'm... Mama.

1580
01:22:33,205 --> 01:22:34,704
Man...

1581
01:22:34,706 --> 01:22:35,771
Mama.

1582
01:22:36,974 --> 01:22:38,940
She done throw a brick in my shit...

1583
01:22:38,942 --> 01:22:39,941
Hi, Darnell.

1584
01:22:39,943 --> 01:22:41,909
You think it's a fucking game?

1585
01:22:41,911 --> 01:22:43,076
You out your mind?

1586
01:22:43,078 --> 01:22:44,944
You gonna throw a brick through my shit?

1587
01:22:44,946 --> 01:22:46,478
Let me kick your shit, Brandi.
Hey!

1588
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:47,512
Let me kick your shit.
Hey!

1589
01:22:47,514 --> 01:22:49,247
How you feel about that?

1590
01:22:49,249 --> 01:22:52,116
And then you disrespect me
in front of my fucking house.

1591
01:22:52,118 --> 01:22:53,984
You're fucking loco.
You out your mind.

1592
01:22:53,986 --> 01:22:55,685
First that old bullshit at the hospital,

1593
01:22:55,687 --> 01:22:57,253
now you bring shit around my house?

1594
01:22:57,255 --> 01:22:58,621
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1595
01:22:58,623 --> 01:23:01,256
You threw a fucking brick
through my Nissan. Shit.

1596
01:23:01,258 --> 01:23:03,958
That's right.
That's right, I threw it.

1597
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:05,492
Get out the car then.
Get out the car.

1598
01:23:05,494 --> 01:23:07,961
Honestly, if you big, bad,
motherfucking bold,

1599
01:23:07,963 --> 01:23:09,395
you want to go ahead?
Get out the car.

1600
01:23:09,397 --> 01:23:10,763
Yeah?

1601
01:23:10,765 --> 01:23:12,097
Guess you're a picture of health.

1602
01:23:12,099 --> 01:23:14,065
Yeah, motherfucking picture of health.

1603
01:23:14,067 --> 01:23:16,901
Mr. Perfect. Mr. Lover.
Everybody wants you.

1604
01:23:16,903 --> 01:23:18,736
That's right. That's why
the fuck you over here.

1605
01:23:18,738 --> 01:23:20,070
Yeah?
And what are you,

1606
01:23:20,072 --> 01:23:21,905
welterweight champion of the whole world?

1607
01:23:21,907 --> 01:23:23,139
What you going to do?

1608
01:23:23,141 --> 01:23:25,241
Fucking right here.
Get out, I'll show you.

1609
01:23:25,243 --> 01:23:26,243
You try it!

1610
01:23:27,778 --> 01:23:29,778
I'm Sugar-smokey-
motherfucking-Robinson.

1611
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:31,412
Honey, let me handle this.
Mama...

1612
01:23:31,414 --> 01:23:33,814
Little mama's boy.

1613
01:23:33,816 --> 01:23:36,249
And you better believe that
I will bust your head wide open.

1614
01:23:36,251 --> 01:23:37,950
You don't come around here harassing me.

1615
01:23:37,952 --> 01:23:40,352
Hi, Ma.

1616
01:23:40,354 --> 01:23:42,921
Don't nobody mess
with my baby. Nobody.

1617
01:23:42,923 --> 01:23:44,656
I will snatch your ass...

1618
01:23:44,658 --> 01:23:46,624
I've been wanting to meet you.

1619
01:23:46,626 --> 01:23:48,959
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

1620
01:23:48,961 --> 01:23:50,060
Watch out for your son.

1621
01:23:51,997 --> 01:23:53,129
Get on out of here!

1622
01:23:55,633 --> 01:23:57,633
I won't have this, Darnell.

1623
01:23:57,635 --> 01:23:58,634
Mama.

1624
01:23:58,636 --> 01:24:00,402
I been living here 45 years.

1625
01:24:00,404 --> 01:24:02,570
I ain't never had no shit
like this happen to me.

1626
01:24:02,572 --> 01:24:03,737
I won't take this.

1627
01:24:03,739 --> 01:24:05,472
Now, you get a restraining order

1628
01:24:05,474 --> 01:24:07,506
before I have to kick out
the rest of her brains.

1629
01:24:09,276 --> 01:24:11,342
Hey, Ma...
Leave me alone.

1630
01:24:11,344 --> 01:24:12,743
Calm down, Ma.
Leave me alone.

1631
01:24:12,745 --> 01:24:14,478
Damn.

1632
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,079
Yo, Tee.

1633
01:24:16,081 --> 01:24:18,114
You ain't gonna believe this shit, man.

1634
01:24:18,116 --> 01:24:20,483
I come to the motherfucking
precinct, right?

1635
01:24:20,485 --> 01:24:22,785
To get a restraining order
like my Mom's asked me to do

1636
01:24:22,787 --> 01:24:23,919
against Brandi, right?

1637
01:24:23,921 --> 01:24:25,820
Because I don't want to hurt the bitch.

1638
01:24:25,822 --> 01:24:28,422
That's... That's just straight,
I don't want to hurt the bitch.

1639
01:24:28,424 --> 01:24:30,123
Right? But I go up in there,

1640
01:24:30,125 --> 01:24:33,593
they give me no respect
in the precinct, man.

1641
01:24:33,595 --> 01:24:37,296
You know, they laugh like,
"She trying to hurt you."

1642
01:24:37,298 --> 01:24:39,458
They don't believe it, man.
Like I'm bullshitting them.

1643
01:24:41,134 --> 01:24:42,134
Yo, my car.

1644
01:24:44,503 --> 01:24:46,269
Sh... My motherfucking car.

1645
01:24:57,647 --> 01:25:01,948
She broke my shit down
in front of the police station.

1646
01:25:01,950 --> 01:25:04,984
She broke me down to my break pads.

1647
01:25:04,986 --> 01:25:07,886
Look at my rear view. Shit.

1648
01:25:07,888 --> 01:25:11,922
This... Where's the justice?

1649
01:25:11,924 --> 01:25:13,123
Officers?

1650
01:25:13,125 --> 01:25:14,958
Where's the fucking justice?

1651
01:25:16,461 --> 01:25:18,160
H-h-h.

1652
01:25:21,265 --> 01:25:22,964
This is bullshit.

1653
01:25:22,966 --> 01:25:24,298
Soon as a...

1654
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:26,566
Soon as a person take the law
in his own hands,

1655
01:25:26,568 --> 01:25:27,766
he fucking wrong.

1656
01:25:30,704 --> 01:25:32,769
And I can't fucking
go nowhere with no tires.

1657
01:25:34,038 --> 01:25:35,038
Damn.

1658
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:37,804
Hey.

1659
01:25:37,806 --> 01:25:39,972
Yeah, yeah.

1660
01:25:39,974 --> 01:25:41,073
What's up?

1661
01:25:41,075 --> 01:25:42,441
What's on your mind?

1662
01:25:42,443 --> 01:25:43,442
Ain't nothing.

1663
01:25:43,444 --> 01:25:46,144
Nothing on my mind, girl.

1664
01:25:46,146 --> 01:25:48,246
Only thing on my mind is you.

1665
01:25:48,248 --> 01:25:49,380
You know what I mean?

1666
01:25:49,382 --> 01:25:50,848
Yeah, well, it doesn't seem like it.

1667
01:25:52,451 --> 01:25:54,217
What you mean, it don't seem like it?

1668
01:25:54,219 --> 01:25:56,385
Because a brother
like to look around, you know,

1669
01:25:56,387 --> 01:25:58,420
Yeah.
See what's behind him?

1670
01:25:58,422 --> 01:26:00,922
Darnell, look, I know you.

1671
01:26:00,924 --> 01:26:04,358
And I know you're not used
to being with one girl.

1672
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:05,926
You know, have you changed your mind?

1673
01:26:12,599 --> 01:26:14,599
Only thing that I changed my mind about,

1674
01:26:14,601 --> 01:26:15,800
is loving you.

1675
01:26:17,937 --> 01:26:19,036
That's right.

1676
01:26:20,639 --> 01:26:21,771
I love you.

1677
01:26:22,774 --> 01:26:24,306
Come on, now.

1678
01:26:24,308 --> 01:26:26,074
I love you too.

1679
01:26:26,076 --> 01:26:27,442
You don't love me.

1680
01:26:37,352 --> 01:26:39,018
I don't love you?

1681
01:26:39,020 --> 01:26:40,419
Yeah, you love me.

1682
01:26:44,757 --> 01:26:46,089
You cold?

1683
01:26:46,091 --> 01:26:47,857
No.

1684
01:26:47,859 --> 01:26:48,859
I'm fine.

1685
01:26:50,394 --> 01:26:52,127
You know, I got some
blankets in the back.

1686
01:26:52,129 --> 01:26:53,695
I was going to use them for a cookout,

1687
01:26:53,697 --> 01:26:55,897
but you can wrap yourself in them.

1688
01:27:04,039 --> 01:27:05,371
Yo, yo.

1689
01:27:05,373 --> 01:27:07,239
<i>How was your little date?</i>

1690
01:27:07,241 --> 01:27:08,607
<i>You looked cute holding hands.</i>

1691
01:27:08,609 --> 01:27:09,741
Hey, what's up, boy.

1692
01:27:09,743 --> 01:27:11,375
<i>Good time with your little friend.</i>

1693
01:27:11,377 --> 01:27:12,709
<i>Get rid of the bitch or I will.</i>

1694
01:27:12,711 --> 01:27:13,910
Yeah.

1695
01:27:13,912 --> 01:27:15,044
Right on.

1696
01:27:15,046 --> 01:27:16,245
<i>Get rid of her.</i>

1697
01:27:17,414 --> 01:27:18,880
That's sure enough a write off.

1698
01:27:18,882 --> 01:27:20,348
Tee, you wild, boy.

1699
01:27:23,553 --> 01:27:25,185
That was Tee?

1700
01:27:26,254 --> 01:27:28,887
Yeah. That boy wild.

1701
01:27:28,889 --> 01:27:30,555
- Tee.
<i>- What's up?</i>

1702
01:27:30,557 --> 01:27:31,856
I got to let Mia go, man.

1703
01:27:31,858 --> 01:27:33,090
<i>What?</i>

1704
01:27:33,092 --> 01:27:35,192
Brandi talking that shit
about hurting her, man.

1705
01:27:35,194 --> 01:27:38,028
<i>Get the fuck out.</i>
I ain't going out like that.

1706
01:27:38,030 --> 01:27:40,063
<i>Shit.</i>
I ain't letting Mia get hurt

1707
01:27:40,065 --> 01:27:42,265
being caught up in my bullshit, man.

1708
01:27:42,267 --> 01:27:43,933
<i>Tell her the truth.</i>

1709
01:27:43,935 --> 01:27:45,834
<i>Even if she did believe my ass,</i>

1710
01:27:45,836 --> 01:27:47,735
<i>she wouldn't let Brandi stand between us.</i>

1711
01:27:47,737 --> 01:27:50,270
<i>I just care about her, man.
I care about her.</i>

1712
01:28:09,889 --> 01:28:11,722
Hey, yo, I want you all to do my a favor.

1713
01:28:11,724 --> 01:28:13,423
We gonna try something new up in here.

1714
01:28:13,425 --> 01:28:17,226
I got Snoop from
Snoop Doggy Dogg's new label,

1715
01:28:17,228 --> 01:28:21,162
Doggystyle Records. We've got...

1716
01:28:21,164 --> 01:28:22,663
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up

1717
01:28:22,665 --> 01:28:24,931
for L.B.C., y'all. Come on.

1718
01:29:16,075 --> 01:29:19,609
I think we moving too fast.

1719
01:29:19,611 --> 01:29:22,078
I think we should take a break.

1720
01:29:27,485 --> 01:29:29,151
What are you talking about, a break?

1721
01:29:32,923 --> 01:29:35,423
You know, I...
I just need some time.

1722
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:39,693
Time for what, Darnell?

1723
01:29:39,695 --> 01:29:41,327
You playing games?

1724
01:29:41,329 --> 01:29:44,196
Mia, I ain't playing no games.

1725
01:29:44,198 --> 01:29:46,364
I just need some time, okay?

1726
01:29:46,366 --> 01:29:51,435
Just...
A brother needs some time.

1727
01:30:03,747 --> 01:30:06,481
W, this is great.

1728
01:30:10,419 --> 01:30:12,986
Look, Smitty asked you for more chocolate

1729
01:30:12,988 --> 01:30:15,455
than Chocolate City,
and you gave him more chocolate

1730
01:30:15,457 --> 01:30:17,089
in Chocolate City.

1731
01:30:17,091 --> 01:30:19,791
Vanilla sprinkled here and there. Man.

1732
01:30:19,793 --> 01:30:20,992
Let me be straight.

1733
01:30:20,994 --> 01:30:24,295
I need two young businessmen
like you two.

1734
01:30:24,297 --> 01:30:25,496
What do you say?

1735
01:30:26,999 --> 01:30:28,798
That's cool, Smitty.

1736
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:30,800
Yeah, that... That's cool,
man.

1737
01:30:32,103 --> 01:30:33,969
Wait, before you go. Wait.

1738
01:30:33,971 --> 01:30:35,770
I offer you a piece of my empire,

1739
01:30:35,772 --> 01:30:39,306
and all you can say is,
"It's cool."

1740
01:30:39,308 --> 01:30:41,808
No, it's just right now
I got some things on my mind.

1741
01:30:41,810 --> 01:30:44,410
Somebody that I'm dealing with.
But I'm telling you, it's cool.

1742
01:30:44,412 --> 01:30:46,245
I... I mean, how am I gonna say
no to a partnership, man?

1743
01:30:46,247 --> 01:30:47,746
Come on, now.

1744
01:30:47,748 --> 01:30:49,414
Yo, Smitty, we need you over at the bar.

1745
01:30:49,416 --> 01:30:50,782
All right. Hey, look.

1746
01:30:50,784 --> 01:30:53,751
Me, you, Tee, lunch, tomorrow,
to discuss it with tickets.

1747
01:30:53,753 --> 01:30:55,319
All right.

1748
01:32:45,484 --> 01:32:47,250
What the fuck are you doing?

1749
01:32:47,252 --> 01:32:49,051
I'm looking for Darnell.
Is he here?

1750
01:32:49,053 --> 01:32:52,454
Darnell? T, it's over
between me and Darnell.

1751
01:32:52,456 --> 01:32:55,123
What's wrong? We got an
emergency at the club.

1752
01:32:55,125 --> 01:32:56,791
I need to see him.
That's your problem.

1753
01:32:56,793 --> 01:32:58,492
After the way Darnell dogged Mia out, no.

1754
01:32:58,494 --> 01:32:59,759
First of all,

1755
01:32:59,761 --> 01:33:01,827
He did not dog Mia out.

1756
01:33:01,829 --> 01:33:03,428
It's that crazy bitch Brandi that said

1757
01:33:03,430 --> 01:33:05,163
she was gonna do something to you.

1758
01:33:05,165 --> 01:33:06,731
So he had to do what he had to do.

1759
01:33:06,733 --> 01:33:08,365
You know what I'm saying?
Anyway,

1760
01:33:08,367 --> 01:33:10,400
do you wanna come with me
so we can try to find him?

1761
01:33:10,402 --> 01:33:12,802
Yeah, T, come on in.

1762
01:33:12,804 --> 01:33:15,371
D-D-Darnell!
S-stop, stop!

1763
01:33:15,373 --> 01:33:17,873
G...!

1764
01:33:17,875 --> 01:33:19,774
P-put your window down,
man.

1765
01:33:19,776 --> 01:33:20,875
Now, you see any damn windows

1766
01:33:20,877 --> 01:33:22,810
in the front of this car, man?

1767
01:33:22,812 --> 01:33:27,447
We g-gotta g-get to the club,
man.

1768
01:33:30,885 --> 01:33:34,453
Shit!
Look at this, D.W.

1769
01:33:34,455 --> 01:33:36,655
Man, I've been in this business
for 15 years.

1770
01:33:36,657 --> 01:33:38,657
Now, maybe I should know better,

1771
01:33:38,659 --> 01:33:40,158
but could you tell me how one minute

1772
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:42,026
I can have people partying in my club,

1773
01:33:42,028 --> 01:33:44,128
and the next minute, I got water damage,

1774
01:33:44,130 --> 01:33:45,896
fire damage, smoke damage.

1775
01:33:45,898 --> 01:33:48,965
Man, this is some freaky shit.

1776
01:33:48,967 --> 01:33:50,266
If I didn't know better,

1777
01:33:50,268 --> 01:33:54,036
I would think that somebody
was trying to ruin me.

1778
01:33:54,038 --> 01:33:56,204
Look, Smitty, just calm down, all right?

1779
01:33:56,206 --> 01:33:57,605
I think I know who did this.

1780
01:33:57,607 --> 01:33:59,440
Look, look, look.

1781
01:33:59,442 --> 01:34:00,908
I know who did it.

1782
01:34:00,910 --> 01:34:02,376
What do you mean, you know who did it?

1783
01:34:02,378 --> 01:34:04,277
I think I know who did it.

1784
01:34:04,279 --> 01:34:05,978
Hold it, hold it, wait a minute, son.

1785
01:34:05,980 --> 01:34:09,281
Trust me on this one,
Smitty. Damn. Trust me.

1786
01:34:16,690 --> 01:34:17,922
He's gonna kill that bitch.

1787
01:34:17,924 --> 01:34:19,924
Do you know where she lives?
Yeah, hell, yeah.

1788
01:34:19,926 --> 01:34:21,292
Well, then, let's go find him.

1789
01:34:21,294 --> 01:34:23,127
Wait, wait, wait.
Where are you guys going?

1790
01:34:23,129 --> 01:34:25,095
I'm going to find Darnell.

1791
01:34:33,638 --> 01:34:35,604
Brandi!

1792
01:34:35,606 --> 01:34:38,239
Brandi, where the fuck are you?!

1793
01:34:38,241 --> 01:34:39,673
Brandi...

1794
01:34:48,182 --> 01:34:50,048
Are you sure it's down this far?

1795
01:34:50,050 --> 01:34:51,682
I hope so.

1796
01:34:51,684 --> 01:34:54,184
Tell me something, Darnell.

1797
01:34:54,186 --> 01:34:55,851
You still a man?

1798
01:34:58,455 --> 01:35:01,756
The main man.

1799
01:35:05,528 --> 01:35:06,693
You know what you are?

1800
01:35:09,964 --> 01:35:11,762
And I didn't think so.

1801
01:35:14,199 --> 01:35:15,364
You're a dog.

1802
01:35:16,967 --> 01:35:19,867
You're a mad dog, to be exact.

1803
01:35:19,869 --> 01:35:23,770
And do you know what they do
with mad dogs?

1804
01:35:23,772 --> 01:35:25,505
I can't hear you.

1805
01:35:25,507 --> 01:35:27,039
No, what they do with mad dogs?

1806
01:35:27,041 --> 01:35:29,006
They shoot mad dogs.

1807
01:35:31,744 --> 01:35:34,544
But I'm not gonna shoot you.

1808
01:35:34,546 --> 01:35:36,445
Not for myself.

1809
01:35:36,447 --> 01:35:41,316
No, I'm gonna shoot you for all women.

1810
01:35:42,852 --> 01:35:44,817
But first, darling...

1811
01:35:47,254 --> 01:35:48,886
look at that.

1812
01:35:48,888 --> 01:35:51,121
We gonna have my birthday cake.

1813
01:35:56,092 --> 01:35:58,125
Shit!

1814
01:35:59,161 --> 01:36:00,426
Know what?

1815
01:36:00,428 --> 01:36:02,094
You fucked with the wrong one.

1816
01:36:05,432 --> 01:36:06,432
You know something?

1817
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:10,267
A man just comes along

1818
01:36:10,269 --> 01:36:13,169
and he buys us off a shelf

1819
01:36:13,171 --> 01:36:14,603
and he plays with us.

1820
01:36:14,605 --> 01:36:17,405
Plays with us until he thinks
we're no longer fun

1821
01:36:17,407 --> 01:36:19,740
or he gets us all dirty, right?

1822
01:36:21,777 --> 01:36:24,911
Then he wants to just throw us away.

1823
01:36:24,913 --> 01:36:26,913
And you know what?
Let me tell you something...

1824
01:36:26,915 --> 01:36:28,214
Mr. Player,

1825
01:36:28,216 --> 01:36:30,316
Mr. Pimp,
Mr. Great Big Daddy.

1826
01:36:30,318 --> 01:36:33,152
We are tired of being your boy toys.

1827
01:36:34,755 --> 01:36:36,321
Let go of me.
We gone too through

1828
01:36:36,323 --> 01:36:37,689
with your lies

1829
01:36:37,691 --> 01:36:41,025
and your wandering eyes.

1830
01:36:41,027 --> 01:36:43,827
Yes, and let me tell you something.

1831
01:36:43,829 --> 01:36:45,628
We're not your bitches, your hookers,

1832
01:36:45,630 --> 01:36:47,763
your whores or your honeys.

1833
01:36:47,765 --> 01:36:49,297
And you know what?

1834
01:36:49,299 --> 01:36:53,333
We do just fine without
your dick or your money.

1835
01:36:55,103 --> 01:36:56,302
So fucking crazy.

1836
01:36:56,304 --> 01:36:57,770
So you see,

1837
01:36:59,039 --> 01:37:01,906
you can't have your cake and eat it too.

1838
01:37:01,908 --> 01:37:03,607
You're out your fucking mind.
Hey!

1839
01:37:03,609 --> 01:37:05,642
Let's retire upstairs.
Yeah, you fucking crazy.

1840
01:37:05,644 --> 01:37:07,276
Shut up!
You fucking...

1841
01:37:10,748 --> 01:37:13,115
I'm so sorry, baby.

1842
01:37:13,117 --> 01:37:15,183
Did that hurt?

1843
01:37:17,854 --> 01:37:19,453
Fuck you, Brandi.

1844
01:37:19,455 --> 01:37:21,755
Fuck you, bitch!

1845
01:37:21,757 --> 01:37:24,190
I don't know how the fuck
you gonna get me upstairs?

1846
01:37:24,192 --> 01:37:25,925
'Cause I ain't walking
up that motherfucker.

1847
01:37:25,927 --> 01:37:26,927
You're not?

1848
01:37:31,532 --> 01:37:33,264
Move it...

1849
01:37:36,068 --> 01:37:37,333
Move it!

1850
01:37:41,004 --> 01:37:42,636
This thing hurt!

1851
01:37:46,975 --> 01:37:49,241
You know, Darnell,

1852
01:37:49,243 --> 01:37:53,411
it's funny how men cooperate
when you lock in on their nuts.

1853
01:37:53,413 --> 01:37:56,147
Of course, I prefer
the word "testicles."

1854
01:37:58,251 --> 01:37:59,817
Tee, that's 333 right there.

1855
01:37:59,819 --> 01:38:01,585
All right, I got it.

1856
01:38:01,587 --> 01:38:03,853
Hold on.

1857
01:38:03,855 --> 01:38:04,855
Yeah.

1858
01:38:10,594 --> 01:38:11,993
Get in the tub.

1859
01:38:11,995 --> 01:38:13,461
I ain't getting in no motherfucking tub.

1860
01:38:13,463 --> 01:38:14,562
Get in the tub!

1861
01:38:25,137 --> 01:38:26,137
So...

1862
01:38:29,006 --> 01:38:31,406
we have anything to say, Darnell?

1863
01:38:31,408 --> 01:38:34,509
Yeah, yeah.

1864
01:38:34,511 --> 01:38:36,444
I motherfucking apologize.

1865
01:38:36,446 --> 01:38:38,145
Shit!

1866
01:38:45,252 --> 01:38:48,319
I apologize.

1867
01:38:48,321 --> 01:38:51,689
But there ain't no need
to kill a nigger over this shit.

1868
01:38:59,465 --> 01:39:02,165
I wasn't always like this, was I?

1869
01:39:02,167 --> 01:39:05,835
I was a good girl.
I... I am.

1870
01:39:05,837 --> 01:39:09,238
I just married the wrong man
for all the right reasons.

1871
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:11,339
Did you shoot his ass too?

1872
01:39:13,576 --> 01:39:15,576
Of course,

1873
01:39:15,578 --> 01:39:18,145
his woman was a blond

1874
01:39:18,147 --> 01:39:20,313
and yours was a nappy head.

1875
01:39:20,315 --> 01:39:23,549
But I trusted you
just like I trusted him.

1876
01:39:23,551 --> 01:39:25,751
You can still trust me.

1877
01:39:25,753 --> 01:39:27,252
You can still trust me.

1878
01:39:27,254 --> 01:39:30,221
And he just smiled,

1879
01:39:30,223 --> 01:39:31,388
smirked,

1880
01:39:31,390 --> 01:39:34,090
When I caught his ass
pouncing up and down

1881
01:39:34,092 --> 01:39:36,058
in my bed with some bimbo...

1882
01:39:41,097 --> 01:39:43,230
it was amazing how he changed.

1883
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:45,265
It was just amazing when he realized

1884
01:39:45,267 --> 01:39:48,033
I was about to electrocute his ass.

1885
01:39:59,110 --> 01:40:01,610
You still think this is a game,
you motherfucker?

1886
01:40:05,315 --> 01:40:06,681
Shit...

1887
01:40:12,555 --> 01:40:13,687
Just be quiet.

1888
01:40:21,429 --> 01:40:22,528
<i>911.</i>

1889
01:40:22,530 --> 01:40:26,397
911, there's an emergency over here.

1890
01:40:26,399 --> 01:40:27,431
I'm trying to keep...

1891
01:40:33,404 --> 01:40:35,604
Shit.

1892
01:40:35,606 --> 01:40:36,606
Tee.

1893
01:40:44,812 --> 01:40:46,845
Get your ass up.

1894
01:40:49,449 --> 01:40:51,282
Where's Darnell?

1895
01:40:51,284 --> 01:40:52,883
Get upstairs.

1896
01:40:56,088 --> 01:40:57,554
Get!

1897
01:40:57,556 --> 01:41:00,890
All right, just calm down.
Just chill, all right?

1898
01:41:02,026 --> 01:41:03,859
Everything's gonna be all right.

1899
01:41:03,861 --> 01:41:06,895
We all need to explain things,
so just stop waving that thing,

1900
01:41:06,897 --> 01:41:08,196
okay?

1901
01:41:08,198 --> 01:41:11,232
This is some real <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> shit.

1902
01:41:11,234 --> 01:41:13,767
You are crazy.

1903
01:41:13,769 --> 01:41:16,035
Get your ass upstairs!

1904
01:41:16,037 --> 01:41:18,904
I can't believe this is
the little bitch he wanted.

1905
01:41:18,906 --> 01:41:20,038
Get up!

1906
01:41:23,977 --> 01:41:25,109
Darnell!

1907
01:41:33,117 --> 01:41:35,450
Darnell, I got your little
nappy head in here.

1908
01:41:35,452 --> 01:41:37,385
You ain't shit without that gun.

1909
01:41:37,387 --> 01:41:38,486
You better shut up.

1910
01:41:39,755 --> 01:41:41,287
Darnell... Where are...?

1911
01:41:41,289 --> 01:41:42,888
Come out or I'll kill her!

1912
01:41:42,890 --> 01:41:45,624
Count of three.
One... two...

1913
01:42:07,278 --> 01:42:08,543
<i>I guess in the end,</i>

1914
01:42:08,545 --> 01:42:10,878
<i>a brother's got to pay.</i>

1915
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:13,280
<i>He's got to pay
for every choice he makes.</i>

1916
01:42:13,282 --> 01:42:14,381
<i>It's a thin line</i>

1917
01:42:14,383 --> 01:42:16,082
<i>between love and hate.</i>

1918
01:42:16,084 --> 01:42:18,217
<i>Nigger, you full of shit!</i>

1919
01:42:18,219 --> 01:42:20,052
<i>All your damn promises.</i>

1920
01:42:20,054 --> 01:42:21,186
<i>Just get out my face.</i>

1921
01:42:21,188 --> 01:42:23,888
<i>You just better praise the Lord</i>

1922
01:42:23,890 --> 01:42:28,191
<i>for giving your lucky ass
a second chance.</i>

1923
01:42:29,761 --> 01:42:31,193
<i>There it is, y'all.</i>

1924
01:42:31,195 --> 01:42:32,861
<i>I stopped trying to be the man,</i>

1925
01:42:32,863 --> 01:42:35,029
<i>and became a man.</i>

1926
01:42:35,031 --> 01:42:36,830
<i>I guess an ass-whipping'll
do that to you.</i>

1927
01:42:36,832 --> 01:42:38,431
Just relax.

1928
01:42:38,433 --> 01:42:41,167
<i>I got lucky when I finally
opened my eyes.</i>

1929
01:42:41,169 --> 01:42:42,601
<i>Mia was still by my side.</i>

1930
01:42:44,404 --> 01:42:47,204
<i>As for Brandi,</i>

1931
01:42:47,206 --> 01:42:49,339
<i>well, she taught me
the true meaning of...</i>

1932
01:42:49,341 --> 01:42:52,342
<i>Of the words, "I love you."</i>

1933
01:42:54,012 --> 01:42:55,612
<i>Don't ever use them unless you mean it.</i>

1934
01:42:59,949 --> 01:43:00,949
<i>Damn!</i>

1935
01:43:03,084 --> 01:43:06,418
<i>I'm truly sorry about
what happened to Brandi.</i>

1936
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:09,053
<i>Hope baby lands on her feet.</i>

1937
01:43:09,055 --> 01:43:11,155
<i>But they better make damn sure</i>

1938
01:43:11,157 --> 01:43:12,923
<i>they fix the dent in her heart</i>

1939
01:43:12,925 --> 01:43:14,758
<i>before they let her out.</i>
